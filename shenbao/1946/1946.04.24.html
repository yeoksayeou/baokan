<p>〔合衆社重慶廿三日電〕馬歇爾將軍今日與軍事三人小組共黨代表周恩來會談，「自由交換意見」歷二小時，馬氏復接見在東京　密蘇里軍艦上簽署日本投降協定之徐永昌將軍，旋復與蔣主席會談。馬氏將於廿四日再晤蔣主席及周恩來，但何時渠將召集三人小組會議，官方尚無表示。報載，俟陳誠將軍返渝，軍事三人小組即將重開會議。據悉馬歇爾今日所談者，大致關於共產黨代表前往南京一事，預料蔣主席·馬歇爾及周恩來將於本週末前往南京。</p>
<p>〔聯合社重慶廿三日電〕馬歇爾特使今日加緊進行「和平會議」，分謁蔣主席並晤周恩來會談，馬氏左右對會談進展，不予披露，惟中共發言人稱：馬周兩氏已「坦白交換意見」。據觀察家意見，國共軍政領袖對原來停戰協定解釋不清，必須另訂新協定，唯措詞明確之書面協定，方能使雙方滿意。</p>
<p>〔聯合社重慶廿三日電〕國府某員本日聲稱：東北問題有妥洽解決可能，其法爲政府交出「某某部份」之控制權，中共則退出長春，哈爾濱及其他大城市，俾國軍能在瀋·長·哈三城間鐵路綫一帶完全自由行動。中共主張爲共軍應控制長春東北面全境，權以東九省南部交予國府。</p>

<h3 id="c5">感謝薩凡奇博士 <a href="#c5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>在今日中國邁進勝利後的建國大道上，這位六十八歲高　的美國水利專家薩凡奇博士（John　Lucian　Savage），不辭長途跋涉，目前重返我國。他此次來華，繼續貫澈他爲中國所設計的揚子江水閘工程（Y·V·A·）計劃而努力推進。這位爲中國四萬五千萬人民創造康樂的民生與富强的國家的　凡奇老人，在我們心目中，感激自不待言。將來照他的計劃實現，他在中國治水的功績當不在夏禹之下。我們除了對他特致崇高的敬禮以外，願就我們所知的揚子江水閘工程計劃，一述梗槪，提供國人的認識。</p>
<p>薩凡奇博士最近來華後，即赴漢視察，已與當軸有具體之決定：長江上游至三峽全境之航空測量，可望於下月間開始，Y·V·A計劃主要設計工作，大致半年內可能完成。至與該計劃有關之社會經濟等調査之準備工作，也即將進行。</p>
<p>這個舉世震驚之揚子江水閘工程計劃之由來，非自今日始，遠在抗戰期間卅三年六月，薩凡奇博士在龍溪河畔的一個小樓上，就照着美國T·V·A·的藍本着手起草的。這個計劃，如能完成，則可與美國田納西河流域管理局（T·V·A·）雄偉的建設與宏大的成就，先後媲美。美國有T·V·A·；中國也有Y·V·A。這是使我們走上富强康樂的一條光明燦爛的大道。</p>
<p>茲將美國的的T·V·A·與中國的Y·V·A·作一比觀？</p>
<p>第一，就水力發電來說：Y·V·A·計劃如能成功，則在水力發電方面，其電量可高至一千萬零五十六萬瓩，比較蘇聯的尼伯爾水電廠電量要大過十九倍强，比較美國的大苦力水電廠亦要大過五倍。而其電力輸送所搆成之輸電網，以宜禺爲中心，東至南京，西抵成都叙府，南則擴展到貴陽桂林，北則遠達天水太原，織成一個廣大的輸電網，籠罩着西南·西北·華西·華中與華東。如此，輸電範圍之廣闊遼遠，堪稱世界第一。蓋揚子江水閘計劃與今後我國國防民生，自必不可分割，息息相關。道個計劃完成以後，川·湘·黔·滇諸省特種礦產之開發，與區域建設及工業化之邁進，可以獲得揚子江水閘所產生的大量廉價水電力之供應。</p>
<p>我們先看看：美國田納西河流械管理局（T·V·A·）之水力發電之成就。T·V，A·之發電能力，其最大動力容量三百餘萬瓩，現祇裝置可用電量二百二十一萬六千八百四十二瓩（一九四五年統計），但已可以動力帮助工業，以電力電化農村，增進一般人民之經濟福利，並增加農村人口之國民所得，眞難以數計。一九四三年電力用戶有聯邦·州·市各機關·合作社·工業·電氣業·鄉村及普遍居民。電費之廉，平均每瓩時三元八分，住宅用電更廉。一九四三年美國每一住宅用戶平均用電一千零四十四瓩時，需費每瓩時三元六角六分。而田納西河流域每一住宅用戶平均用電一千五百九十八瓩時，電費每瓩時一元九角六分。一九四三年全美每一住宅付電費三千八百二十美元，田納西河流域每一住宅僅付三千一百三十美元。用電最多至百分之五十五點五，然電費反减少百分之廿二。十年前，田納西河流域之電力每人四百瓩時，增加六倍（中國每人五瓩時），足見電力經濟效用之大。</p>
<p>第二，就改進農業來說：Y·V·A·計劃，如能成功，則對於農業改進方面，由於揚子江水閘的容積龐大，灌漑農田，可達六千萬英畝，而且水位高度亦趨正常化，水早之災，得以根絕。蓋西南，西北，華西各省大多係高原地帶及丘陵地區，山嶺重重，氣候特殊，故各地農作物之栽種，亦與他地不同。我國農民自古以來，靠天吃飯，稍缺雨水，即成旱災。因之，中國農業，仍然受自然的支配，而未有科學的改進。Y·V·A·成功以後，則對於農業改進，必然走上科學時代的途徑。由於Y·V·A·工程的成就，將來中國也可達到農業電氣化，農業技術化。况農業工業化，亦必須先有電氣化之條件，而後始能進於科學化，機械化。</p>
<p>我們再看美國田納西河流域管理局（Y·V·A·）對於農業改進之成就：田納西河流域，十年前，農塲及農家無電燈設備者十居八九，自無農業電氣化之可言。在一九三三年，每二十八個農塲中有一個電化農塲，至一九四三年則每五個農塲中就有一個電化農塲。田納西河流域八萬五千個農塲大都電化。居民今已全用電燈；並且利用電力耕作，及電力保存農作物。田納西河流域管理局之電力，經由一百廿八家電力公司零售分配，給予農村及農民極大便利。更鼓勵農民組織農塲十電力合作社，而林業亦得電力之助，營業增加。而且創立「電氣冷藏合作社」，每家皆有冰箱設備，利用電力，終年得以冷藏雜物。關於新農業技術方面的改進，由於表土流失，致土地枯瘠，改進農業首重土壤保持。Y·V·A·在「威爾遜壩」設立肥料廠，大量製造濃度肥料，尤以磷酸鹽爲最多。自磷肥製造技術成功，推廣到一般農民，接受新農業的技術，而農民信服磷肥之效果，紛紛組織「農業改進協會」，以增進農業科學化。</p>
<p>第三，就交通航運來說：Y·V·A·計劃，如能完成，則在交通航運方面，可直航萬噸海輪於渝滬錢，溯江西上至一千二百哩，且於宜昌中途，不必再有換輪之苦。蓋揚子江主幹流域至宜昌以上，其河床搆造與川江完全不同，故每次航行上海重慶間之航道，皆分數段航行，而不能由上海直航重慶。因之，貨運輾轉，固甚困難，而運費增多，尤不經濟。國府西遷與勝利還都，我們深感分段航行不能直達之痛苦。揚子江自宜上游，其水位即深淺靡定，險灘林立，船隻失利，不斷發生。昌况水性險惡，江中石壘棋布，航行艱阻重重，每當隆冬時節，川江上游叙渝一綫，竟致數十噸之小火輪亦有停航之處。Y·V·A·計劃成功以後，將米水閘調節，過去險惡，一掃而空，上海重慶間之航運，必可暢通無阻。（下接第二版）</p>
<p>哈市蘇軍今撤退　董彥平等擬經海參威回國　四平街方面戰事甚爲激烈</p>

<p>— 方仁寄於瀋陽</p>
<p>三月廿九日，記者飛離了長春，兩小時以後，機身在錦州機塲着陸。同機飛到錦州的人，他們都吐出沉甸甸的一口氣，愛說話的人衝口說出：「現在算是安全了」。</p>
<p>久住長春的人儘管誇耀着說：二長春是一塊福福地，東北曾經過了許許多多風浪，在其他地區，都有過血染河山的故事，而長春偏能在空子裏偸偸度過了浩刦。像去年八一五，日本人投降以後，也並沒有弄到血流漂杵的景象，而去年十一月的中旬，行營撤離長春時，眼看着大禍臨頭，結果却終能化險爲夷，但是，現在，陽春三月，駘蕩的春風，雖未能　秃枝吹出綠葉，而原野上積雪融化，白皚皚的大地現出本來的面目時，這福地却充滿了火藥氣。</p>
<p>當東北主權開始接收的時候，應該是中國人的一件喜事，但是，事實告訴我們，三月十三日蘇軍離開了四平，十七日便有人圍攻省府，以火箭砲（據調査對方共有四門）把劉翰東主席所布置的電網防禦工事，電源所在的發電所轟毀了，使四平陷於混亂的局面。四平在十七日以前，已處於被包圍的態勢，待機而動的眈眈虎視者，把傢伙準備着，一到時機，便要動手，誰都看得出這一步棋。終於在十七日子夜還未開始時拉開了戲幕，省府以不到四千人，敵兩萬掛零之衆，數量上已佔了劣勢，而還不到四千人的保安隊和警察正在整訓中，吃敗仗爲當然不可免之事。劉翰東以次，由四平被移到梨樹，再由梨樹移到四平，後來覺得地們中一些人可以讓回長春，廿五日劉翰東等十四人車離四平，本來當天可達，在中途公主嶺（離畏春四平各爲一百廿里）又被留宿一夜，到廿六日夜間十時五十分，繁星繫天，長春市像死去了一樣的沉寂中，纔回到了滿炭大樓。從十七日到廿六日，前後共是十天，這十天中，由回來的十四個人臉上看去，都是形容憔悴，顏色枯槁，而且眞是一身以外無長物。當中最顯然看出的是省府秘書長徐鼐，因爲他是記者去年在長春就認識的朋友。</p>
<p>劉翰東主席一行十四人回來，大樓中沒有就寢的人，迎着他們敬致慰問之忱。劉主席見了大家，坐定了後，慢慢說出他們自一月八日由長春到了四平，四平原有的某種部隊，便由市區移駐郊區，省府所接收的四平，自接收之日起，即處於被包圍的態勢中。而某種部隊在四洮路上由東向西經過市區運煤，政府人員也只有看着氣焰逼人叱咤而過的火車頭，揚長而去。十七日上演了老早就預料到的一幕，衆寡不敵，彈盡糧絕，四平終於陷入了混亂的局面。劉主席說他離長春時，所帶到四平去的基本武力是：保安隊一連，步槍百支，子彈三萬發，不過如此而已。臨睡之前，徐　秘書長還和記者私自談了一陣話，他向記者吿別時，想找得幾片安眠藥片，他說：「十天當中，沒有得到一點休息」恐怕要睡還睡不着」。他雖這樣說，但記者手頭沒有這東西，只得向他表示歉意。</p>

<p>〔本報南京廿三日電〕宋院長子文今日下午二時偕夫人及蔣秘書長夢麟，自渝抵京，當此兩行政院首長之專機降落此間光華門外機塲時，歡迎人員，異常稀少。據悉，宋氏此來，係較一般人士預料渚爲早，蓋今日週二原爲政院例會之期。又較宋氏專機稍早飛抵此間明故宮機塲者，另有黨國元老丁惟汾，糧食部長徐堰及司法行政部長謝冠生等大員數人。凡此跡象，均可證當務及政治之重心，確已自渝移京。據悉，原應今日舉行之政院例會或將於日內臨時通知，在京召開。宋院長於今晨十時二十分離渝，所乘之馬歇爾元帥專機，由渝飛京，使費時三小時又四十分，創京渝間飛航新紀錄。</p>

<p>〔中央社河內廿一日電〕（遲到）廿一日下午三時半，法軍車一輛與我軍　重車一輛，在河內市中心區劍湖邊相撞，於雙方正停車査究責任時，法軍突發槍擊斃我駕駛兵一名，雙方遂即發生衝突，一時市區槍聲四起，秩序大亂，我五十三軍軍部以我方已交防，不負治安責任，即約東所部，並以電話通知各方，不得開槍，衝突旋即停止。斯時越南革命份子，突乘機襲擊，至四時許，槍聲更密，中央社河內分社附近越人，更向法人住宅開槍，旋經中法越三方聯絡官馳赴各地，命令停止，槍聲至五時始息。據五十三軍團軍長稱：事件發生後，三方即命令所部，不准開槍，惟有若干地區之我軍正哨，及駐於車站之我軍被園。</p>
<p>〔中央社河內廿二日民〕廿一日下午中法軍車互撞衝突事件，經雙方當局處置後，已告一段落。卅一日衝突中，法軍曾出動坦克車多輛，在市區巡邏鳴槍，至發生衝突地達五處之多。法軍坦克車，並在劍湖邊開砲一發，且有一部份法軍，向我青年日報館開槍，該院內樹被擊中，我方士兵除於撞車地點被擊斃四名外，市區各處共被擊斃十五人，法軍方面死傷人數不詳。我第一方面軍司令部以法軍業已接管河內市區防務，負責維持治安秩序，竟發生此不幸事件，已向法軍司令提出抗議，要求懲兇賠償損失，爲明瞭雙方責任，並已由中法雙方各派代表組織委會，進行調査。</p>

<p>我們來看美國田納西河流域管理局（T·V·A·）之交通航運的成就：美國這條田納西河，是一條由南而北倒流的怪河，百年來不知奪去了多少的生命與破壞了多少的田園，尤以一八七九，一八八六，一九一七幾年田納西河洪水災禍爲最大，爲居民腦海中永不磨滅的恐懼。田納西河流域一帶居民，因不事造林，使五十二吋雨量，不經地內而竟在地面上流，潛伏洪水之患。地面之保土植物，不足以遏制洪水流勢，寳貴的表土亦隨水而去，游塞航道，隨而汜濫。田納西河流域地帶，亦如揚子江流城上游地帶一樣，多邱陵起伏之牧地林地及農田，亦有不少煤與鐵在地下蘊藏。自田納西河流域管理局（T·V·A·）成立以來，治河工程，成積卓著，在幹流造減水池，在支處建蓄水庫，截取支流受水面積之逕流以減少洪水期間之幹流水量。至一九四四年，幹支流各項工程俱吿完成。由於田納西河河身甚淺，有僅深度一尺者，沿岸低級商品因運費價昻不能利用，實經濟上之重大損失。乃有美國陸軍工程隊之計劃，主張渠化，開闢通航九呎水道，並築高壩七座，或低　卅二座，十年來先後完成之壩共三十一座，由美國陸軍移交者一，購自私人者四！自造者十六。關於田納西河之水位，水性之管制，沿河皆設有「雨量站」及「河道水標站」，紀錄雨量及水流，隨時報吿增庫，關於田納河流域之航運方面，十年來，開發可航海岸九千哩，等於太平洋，大西洋，墨西哥灣等可航海岸之合計長度。在一九三三年田河航運僅三千二百六十五萬八千九百五十一噸哩，至一九四二年，已增至一萬六千一百四十六萬九千三百四十四噸哩，預計於一九六〇年貨運將增至十億噸哩。</p>
<p>以上僅就揚子江水閘工程關於水力發電，改爲農業及交通航運三方而未來成就作一烏瞰。至整個計劃非短篇所能描述。</p>
<p>而且揚子江水閘工程將來如能成功，對於揚子江流域之商業繁榮，必隨着工業發達，農業振興，與交通暢通而日益擠進。此可與美國田納西河流域輝煌相映。至揚子江之三峽風景，秀麗絕倫，雄偉蓋世，將來亦必爲中。外人士游覽勝地，誠如瑞士每年一筆巨量的國際收入。我們更看：田納西河流域，水田交錯，工廠林立，游泳泛舟，垂釣避暑，風景優美，從荒凉變成了樂國，將來揚子江流域也必如此。</p>
<p>總之，Y·V·A·不是一個奇異的夢，而是薩凡奇博士爲中國建國之助的一個具體建設的計劃。我們認爲：</p>
<p>（其一）這個Y·V·A·建設計劃的開始實行，可以解決當前中國最重大的問題，就是軍事復員後縮軍問題。裁編的數百萬大兵，從此有了「充分就業」的出路，而「寓兵於工」，尤其是走上國防現代化，科學化，機械化之一條光明的大道，亦正是中國從農業國邁進工業國的一條燦爛的捷徑。</p>
<p>（其二）這個計劃的實行，當前沒有資金困難的問題。因爲我們的友邦美國的對外投資，對Y·V·A·亦如美國T·V·A·同樣感到興趣。前年薩凡奇博士爲我們設計了Y·V·A·計劃返美後，發表一篇「中國電燈之瓩」一文，强調揚子江三峽水閘計劃之重要，他以「可能影響世界歷史」的警語敦促美國人士的注目。他更從若干方面：「（一）就業方面，若揚子江水閘計劃得速予修建，美國電氣及機械工業將於未來二十四年內日夜忙碌；（二）投資方面，將成爲美國對外投資最有益之榜樣；（三）外交方面，因在華利益之根深蒂固，東西兩大國中美之友誼，將日益增進，」希望美國人士的投資。又有國際善後總署經濟顧問斯坦萊氏（Engene　Staley）於其近著：「世界經濟發展」一書中，對美國現有之儲蓄與將來對外之投資與揚子江水閘興建之關係，詳加論列，結語並謂：「故揚子江水閘之興建，若美國朝野發生興趣，則於其龐大之投資額中抽出十萬萬美元，恐不會感到若何困難。」</p>
<p>（其三）這個計劃的實行，常前亦沒有「設備」困難的問題。因爲我們友邦美國戰後的剩餘物資·器材·機器，正在尋找適當的處置。我們可以從「美國戰後經濟政策」，及「剩餘資產處置法案」看出美國剩餘物資與器材對揚子江水閘工程興建之深切關係來。谷春帆先生曾經說明：「謂據一九四三年六月十九日之「商業周報」所載，工廠機器設備即價値一六六億美元，是其與揚子江水閘工程，及與由水閘發生熱·光·力·灌溉所附帶而生之企業，不無小補。如美國常局能顧及此點，則戰後美金之苦悶與剩餘物資之呆滯，均可藉此而得大部份合理之解決。」</p>
<p>（其四）這個計劃的實行，當前亦沒有「技術」困難的題。因爲我們友邦美國於戰前戰時及今後，皆在技術方面予我們重大的帮助。戰時我們政府渥承美國政府許可，政府先後派有若干技術人員去美實習硏究，美國的F·E·A·（美國對外經濟局）並且在經濟上直接帮助我們派遣技術人員赴美硏習。只有揚子江水閘工程開始興建，中國工程技術人員可以總動員，而美國技術專家，工程專家，水利專家，科學專家亦必樂於爲這個「影響世界歷史」的人類偉大工程而協助我們。</p>
<p>在勝利後建國的道上，不幸我們於長春一帶漫天烽火的今日，歡迎而又歡送這個爲中國四萬五千萬人民造福的薩凡奇老博士，我們全民實在萬分慚愧，也萬分感激</p>
<p>我們所慚愧的…我們這個民族太不爭氣，國家太落後，社會太消沉！今天的世界正走上「和平」的新路，但我們却還有人蓄意製造內亂！今天的世界，在謀「全人類的幸福繁榮與生存，但我們却有一部分人竟在若干地區「大施屠殺老百姓」！今天的世界，「國家至上」，「建設第一」，但我們還是黨派至上，地盤第一！這眞是中華民族的奇恥大辱！我們對着這個薩凡奇老先生，只有慚愧！我們國民要珍愛建國的前途，不得不要求安定第一，建設第一！</p>
<p>我們所感激的：薩凡奇老先生以其六十八歲的高齡，苦心孤詣，終日策劃要把我們這落後的國家帶上現代化·科學化·工業化·電氣化的康莊大道。他要把他的晚年，爲我們中華民族的生存與幸福而奮鬥！我們對着薩凡奇老先生，只有感激。我們在歡迎歡送之際，不得不要求中共趕快放下屠刀，讓政府領導人民，大家以力和汗建成Y·V·A·！</p>
<p>唉！政治逆流·激盪了政局不安；黨爭不絕，掀起了漫天烽火！今日國人謀國之忠，如友人薩凡奇老博士者能有幾人？我們對着這位水利之神，建設之聖的薩凡奇博士，只有萬分慚愧，萬分感謝！</p>

<p>〔本報廿三日東京特派員專電〕幣原內閣辭職後，對於總任者人選，各方推測頗多，但以吉田及鳩山一郞呼聲最高。日外省發言人今宣稱，幣原及其閣員今晨召關特別會議，會後赴進步黨辦公處，旋並以該黨領袖名義，與自由及社會民主黨首腦商內閣辭聯後所引起之各項問題。</p>
<p>〔本報廿三日東京特派員專電〕日皇裕仁原定今晨訪麥帥，臨時取消，引起一般人之猜疑。據消息靈通方面宣稱，日皇中止訪麥帥，係接受吉田與幣原之忠吿。幣原認爲日皇在彼職辭後數小時訪麥帥，必將引起一般人對新閣之種種不利猜測，故以不訪爲上策。</p>
<p>〔聯合社東京廿三日電〕麥帥總部今晨宣稱：幣原內閣辭職及其繼任之遴選，麥帥保持「不千涉」政策，由其自行決定，推麥帥總部以日政府爲執行指令之機關，日方所遴選之內閣，而不能接受麥帥總部之政策，自屬不可能。截至現在爲止，日方政治策動雖極積極，麥帥迄未公開表示意見。</p>

<h3 id="c47">爲對號入座問題　八家電影院停業　「增雇多數招待員不勝負擔」　同業公會推代表向各界呼籲　並定今日上午召開緊急會議 <a href="#c47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕市警局於前日通令本市各電影院，於昨日下午起，必須將所售戲票一律對號入座，如違則勒令停業。現本市大上海·金都·巴黎·金城·平安·滬光·新光及杜美等入戲院，因在短期內實行，決非院方經濟能力所能負擔，故不得已，昨起暫告停業。並請求電影業同業公會予以援助。</p>
<p>據該公會發言人告本報記者，電影院欲將戲票改爲對號入座，確實非常困難。第一，對號入座，觀衆必於即將開演後到達，塲中燈熄後入內，招待方面，諸多不便。同時塲內外觀眾擁擠，秩序勢必混亂不堪。第二，如對號入座，必須增　多數招待員，則院方開支激增，不勝負擔，必雖維持。前亞洲影院在開演特殊戲劇時，曾調動各院招待員服務，但範圍較小之影院，即不易實行矣。</p>
<p>本市大華·國泰·金門及國際四影院，原係對號入座者，故無問題。至大光明·南京及美琪三院，則於昨日下午臨時在票上書寫號數，由觀衆自找座位。</p>
<p>電影業同業公會，於昨日推舉代表任矜　等多人，向市政府，市臨時參議會駐會委員及市商會等處呼籲，解釋困難，並請求援助。停業之八戲院經理則於昨日下午五時，在大上海戲院集議，決議數點：（一）八家被勒令停業戲院，登報公吿社會，並加緊向各方呼籲。（二）請求警局從緩實行。電影業同業公會定今日上午召開緊急會議，亦於下午三時假康樂酒家招待新聞界，請求主持公道。</p>

<p>— 本報十七日航訊　特約記者梁小中</p>
<p>南寧變成商人王國</p>
<p>淸明時節，幾番風風雨雨，沉悶的日子更加沉悶，煩囂的都市也一天比一天熱鬧。由於農村的高速度破產，資金迅速地流向城市商人的保險箱裏的緣故，南寗也沒有例外。這幸運的都市，正在一天一天地走向畸形的繁榮，南寧在向着繁榮走，罪惡跟在南寧的後面，商人主宰着一切。</p>
<p>這亞熟帶的小都市，並不是不可愛。一塲新雨後，街道兩旁綠得發亮的樹林滴着雨水，樹林的下面擺滿了香蕉，枇杷，梅子，龍眼，蜜柚……小商人尖起嗓子叫着：「來咯，來咯，要食新鮮生果就來！」着實別有一番風味。抬頭一望，古城頭籠罩着薄薄的一層輕烟，雄偉的崑崙山隱約浸沉在遠處的雲層裏，西江水依繞着古城，靜靜地，慢慢的流，三兩船戶拿着烟斗，蹲在船頭，用南寗的土話——平話閑撩着天。一切都是那麽恬靜，八萬人便淡淡地在裏面過渡着日子，最忙的只有「生意」而已。</p>
<p>每夜閑踱過江邊一帶林立的經紀行，濃重的茴油，八角，桐油的氣味刺激着神經，傾倒法光，雙毫，袁頭，銅板的聲音，震盪着耳膜。穿着一套黑膠綢，手裏拿着一把雨傘的商人，匆匆忙忙的進進出出，錢和貨便整天地在這些街道上交流着。天一亮，大批的汽車便分道揚鏢，開到河內，開到梧州去。開到河內的闖了一次關，回來便帶回了一大批洋雜，法光之類，開到梧州去的，便是茴油，八角，準備候船而下省港。金子的生意便跑到柳州去，坐起中航機，分飛渝滬各地，路綫分明，有條不紊，於是老闆的腰包，也就一天比一天「麥克麥克一了。</p>
<p>南寗雖然也有一條大河，但是我們早已經吿訴你，「那是一條靜寂的西江」，大槪已經有兩個月聽不到輪船的汽笛聲了。船到那裏去？不外是軍運頻繁，都給拉了伕東去不回而已。商人的貨運少了一條好大路。就只有借重汽車，於是，一時運輸行有如雨後春筍，小小的城市，竟差不多有五十家運輸行，無論商車軍車，都不會機會落空，大家平分春色，大家發財。</p>
<p>酒翻羅裙舞倦紅綃</p>
<p>正因爲南寧純粹是一個商人的王國，盡管南寧的周圍早就佈滿了飢餓的黑影，但是這方橫二里半的小城市，却永遠都沒有减去一分徽謌逐酒的歡悮，紙醉金迷，到處是一番「昇平氣象」。夜夜漫步街頭　五步一餐廳，十步一酒館，呼么喝六之聲，還有神女們肉麻的尖銳的叫，討厭的歌喉，混成了一股邪氣，把人間的悲苦掩蓋盡了！商人們有的是錢，有的是金條，自然就會盡情地享受，南河下的特察里（廣西的妓寮一概都美其名曰「特察里」，簡稱「特區」，）更是夜夜元宵，朝朝寒食，酒翻羅裙，舞倦紅綃，一槪都是七十二行的行家們特有的享受。一個大亨，用與一個妓女一樣重的關金替她贖身的「艷事」，傳遍了這城市。一個開金店的少東，用金子買服了一個女學生的心底「韻史」，也成爲絕好的談話資料。一個「錢」字，支配了南寗的生命。</p>
<p>對物質享受慾充滿着內心的人，到道一個小城市來，也不會太使他們失望。這裏一樣有影院，有舞塲，有秘密的「擦背」浴室，酒店裏面女招待的笑渦柳眉，一樣地迷惑着你的心田，旅館裏多得可怕的流鶯飛燕，也一樣會使你樂不思蜀，甚麼都有，只要你有鈔票，眞是一呼百諾，記者初到南寗，寄寓旅店的時候，竟然會有夥計推門進來，問：「要不要玩一玩野味」？替野鷄拉皮條，據說他們的規例是得錢之後，野鷄佔六成，夥計佔四成。</p>
<p>還有一件嚴有趣的事情，廣西是一個禁賭最嚴厲的省份，而南寗的大街小巷，却到處可聞麻將，牌九之聲，大賭窟由一些「勢力集團」把持着，爲官廳所奈何不得。這才眞是南方的蒙地卡羅，有牧豬奴癖者，盍興乎來！</p>
<p>吃草榨乳墮胎致死</p>
<p>一方面是荒淫與無恥，一方面是嚴肅的工作，中國的公務員和執敎鞭生涯的人都是一條苦命，到處一樣景像凄凉，說出來眞替吃草榨奶的敎師們掬一把同情淚！這裏有五家私立中學，一家省中，（最近分成初高中），兩家師範，私立中學敎師的待遇，最高的不過三萬塊，公立中學的待遇，比較好一點，也不外五萬塊左右。單生漢子倒還勉强，有家室的人簡直是叫苦連天，最近省一聯中，有一個姓林的女敎師，已經懷胎五月，爲了五萬塊錢的薪給，的確再養不起道第六條小生命，（她已經有了五個孩子），於是跑到一個醫生處墮胎，結果是母子俱遭慘死，剩下最大的孩子才八歲，最小的一個才一歲，呼娘喚母，景况悽慘已極。至於小學的敎師，更是黃連煮豬胆，苦上加苦，每月名義是薪津三千元，另外有一百斤米，但是從元月份到現在，還沒有得過一文錢，一粒米，弄到男敎師課餘到街上擺地攤，女敎師替人做針綫度日，困苦之狀，使孔夫子復生，亦必會深深地嘆一句：「余欲無言！」南寗是廣西首富之縣，尙且如此，其他邊僻鄕陲之地，自更不堪聞問了。</p>
<p>學生慘苦寗願坐牢</p>
<p>敎師苦，學生也苦，私立學校一個學期勒收四萬多塊的學雜費不用說，公立學校也未必便好交易，學費少，苛捐雜稅多，甚麽賠償費，板凳費，架牀費……無物不費，無費不昻，一抽也是三兩萬，校長便拿這些錢交給舅子庶務，乾兒子出納之類，去運用而又運用，大做其生意。學生沒宿舍住不管，沒水用不管，沒敎師更不管，一團糟糕，烏烟瘴氣，那裏是甚麽學校？米珠蔪桂，（現在南寗的米只賣二萬元，算是全省最平的地方了。）送一個子弟讀書，一個學期起碼要十多萬，實在沒有幾個家長支持得了，結果是天天有學生辦退學手續，甚至從開學到學期終結，退去了一半的學生，是常有的事。師範生名義是公費，其實一個月只能够拿三四千塊錢，一個師範生苦着臉對記者說：「這樣的待遇，我倒寗願去坐平！」記者問他爲甚麽？他笑一笑道：「爲的是犯人每天還有二十兩米的囚糧，比我們好得多了。」每一天黃昏時候，都可以看見三三兩兩穿得又破又爛的學生，在平等街一帶的故衣攤前，兜售着一些文具書籍之類，要不然，一個月一萬五千塊的伙食費怎麽辦，窮學生多也多得可憐，是南寗的一個特色，其實也可以說是廣西的普通現象。</p>
<p>省府遷邕可望實現</p>
<p>這個小都市，倒着　够民主，不輪清一色，雜一色的報章，雜誌，在這裏都可以看得到，買得到，純潔的青年着實也有不少人開始在中毒，丟了書本筆桿，趕着開會，蘊釀風潮。前些兒還有一小部分企圖不明的人鬧得這山城風聲鶴唳，現在一切都平靜了。全市共有報紙三家：一家中央日報，一家廣西日報，一家商人辦的商報，都是對開一大張，各有各的讀者。書店是絕無僅有，因爲所有的書店，十九都只能够叫做書攤，賣的都是民國廿七八年的貨色而已。上海的報紙一週來一次，側也着實受人歡迎。</p>
<p>最近南寗正在大事拆城，改修環城馬路，說起了馬路，便想起了南寗的市政，南寗的市政，是「馬路不平，電燈不明，電話不靈。」</p>
<p>省政府有自桂遷邕之說，苟成事實，南寗的商人氣息，大槪會被政治的氣息冲淡一點了。</p>

<h3 id="c66">所謂「南通慘案」之謎 <a href="#c66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>— …十八日通訊　姚葳寄…</p>
<p>屛峙江北而以物產富饒民情陳惇樸號稱模範縣的南通縣，自從勝利的號角吹澈，敵人拖着慘落的影子走後，人們就開始想走上舊日安居樂業的途徑，可是，這些美麗的夢終竟爲騷擾不休的新四軍破壞了，賸餘給南通人的，只是一座城廓而已。可是和平的鐘聲響了，執行小組終於成立了。</p>
<p>執行小組是三月十八日晚到達的，住兩周，至三十一日離通赴如，旋又部份來通，又部份返如，又部份赴滬。到現在爲止，政府組蕭組長一行，仍留南通，鄧克則去淮陰，中共代表在如　，歷時近一月，雙方意見商而未協，會而不議，幾成僵局。南通是平靜的，但是所謂「南通慘案」自滬報傳來，平靜的南通，不得不在靜靜的湖面，留下一個漩渦！</p>
<p>「慘案」究竟「慘」在那裏呢？讓記者首先記載一點事實吧。</p>
<p>騷動的行列</p>
<p>執行小組蒞通的消息，是三月十七日帶給全市市民的十八日淸晨，從市民，到學生，到公務員，就忙着集合前往西門孩兒巷，期待小組的降臨，那時早已有三十多個青年，執有「文藝協會」的旗幟，看見人民團體走過，即高呼「反對官辦人民團體！」學生行列走過，又大呼「學生走出牢籠！」「有血氣的走到這邊來！」民衆行列成萬的走過，又高呼「取消保甲制度！」「反對淸查戶口！」「反對一黨專政！」但是不巧，天下雨，又爲的是小組已無，午前蒞通的可能，所以大部份歡迎人員，只有把滿腔的熱情暫時壓抑下來，整隊回去休息，以待午後再來。但是行列的一部份，開始騷動，誰走就是「落伍」，責駡着，鄙笑着，瘋吼着，他們對抗着寒風，冷雨，和飢餓，高呼着等待自由與光明。靑年是易於衝動的，羣衆心理是盲目的，於是局部的騷動，引動了全部。領隊的敎員再不能使學生守規律，因爲他們說：「今天已經是民主的日子了！」民主，就是敎員再不能管學生，於是敎員走了，「解放」了學生，學生成了「民主」陣營。於是他們在風雨交迫之中，唱着歌，呼着口號。這樣，一直到晚上六時，才尾隨着執行小組的吉普車痕而返。他們基本隊伍三十餘人，加上所謂「有血氣」的，共計六七十人。</p>
<p>執行小組的任務，是國共間軍事的調處，比如「反對一黨專政！」「學校監牢化！」「反對特務敎員！特務學生！」「取消保甲制度！」「要收回東北，先收回香港！」類之，是無法接受的，同時，爲了時間已晚，小組代表們理應進餐休息了，所以在到達招待所後，曾由政府組代表楊參謀出外，一再婉勸明日再談，可是羣情是這樣的偏激，非達目的不止，於是排成大隊的人羣，盲動的衝到招待所地點——「桃之華館」，希望美方代表鄧克接見。鄧克不允接見，但經他們一再要求，鄧克終於出見。同時答應學生們次日（十九日下午二時）的茶會，但是鄧克相當疲勞了，同時接着的是南通各界的歡宴。爲了南通人士的超乎一切的熱忱，美國共三方代表都是樂聲悠揚中杯酒交歡，盡興痛飲，以致三方代表均有醉意，加之鄧克連日旅途奔波，竟抱小恙，終至延誤了次日下午的茶會。那一個茶會，鄧克未到，却由隨小組同來的共方新華社記者吳靑和樊發源充任了臨時的報吿者，學生們沒有提出他們的希望，兩位記者也沒有答覆學生們要求的能力。就這樣，一塲風波過去了。</p>
<p>孫平天失蹤</p>
<p>事情就是這樣的，但是誰都承認這裏的尾巴是可怖的，也種下了所謂「慘案」的孽種。就是廿五日一個青年孫平天失蹤了，同時，在四月四日又於天生港江面發現了孫平天的屍體。這是一個謎，一個慘痛的謎！孫平天是一個卸職已久歷任僞報記者的靑年，但是始終以記者做幌子，參加各種活動，可是爲什麼會失蹤？爲什麼又浮現在江面？據這裏的流言是這樣的：有人說是因爲二十二日晚曾有孫日新等三人，於返家途中失蹤，因孫等均係孫平天友好，爲激忿出走。有人說他們一同走向新四軍地區，但孫平天並非共產黨，又爲新四軍誣爲搗亂份子，施以酷刑，並繫以巨石下江，以圖滅跡，誰知春雨汜濫，江水陡漲，水勢衝逐而下，以至在天生港江面浮現，（按：天生港上游，乃新四軍駐在地。）有人說是私仇，藉此機會報復，希圖移轉視錢。又一說是情殺案，事涉桃色。總之，衆說紛紜，究竟孫平天死於誰的手？只有天知道。</p>
<p>實情的調查</p>
<p>這裏，記者曾特別去訪晤了幾位負責方面，徵詞他們關於靑年們失蹤的消息：第一位是南通女師範校長羅玉衡。羅女士服務敎育界垂卅年，掌管女師近二十年。她說：「我見了上海報上說女師範有兩個學生遭逮捕，據詳實調查，實在沒有這回事。至於請假的，到有三四個，但大都是家長來請的假。現在學生上課，很安靜，沒有什麼混亂的現象。」關於女師在滬學生代表，羅校長說：「我不知道，不過這大槪總是事後組織的。</p>
<p>其次是省立南通中學，顧校長因校事赴鎭江洽商未返，由敎務主任黃應韶接見，據談：「報載本校有二十餘人被捕，我不能說是，寄讀的學生一個未缺，走讀的學生在全部學生一千多名之中，有十餘名請假的，自然亦不足爲怪。至於他們請了假的去向，學校是不曉得的。不過，我們同事中却有一位錢素凡先生，是在校內被逮捕去的。逮捕的人臨走時曾說「我們是共產黨」。究竟到那裏去了呢？是被誰捕去了呢？眞是一個謎！」</p>
<p>葉組長憤慨</p>
<p>執行小組政府組蕭組長適於十四日由滬返通。他說：「我在滬時就見到滬報有記載南通慘案的新聞，當時何總長還問我究竟是怎麽回事？我說：根本沒有什麼慘案不慘案。同時這條新聞還把鄧克不曾接見學生代表的罪過諉於官方，也可以說，尤其是我，不得不聲明，鄧克接見不接見，我是沒有權力過問的。至於飲酒過量，這是人在興奮時常有之事，怎麽能强調是官方灌醉？用辭迫人，太不成話！」說着，他非常氣憤。</p>
<p>劉師長，徐專員，楊縣長，張區長，他們都這麽說：「我們不能讓錯誤存在無數不明眞相的人們的心裏，我們要讓大家明白事實。</p>
<p>孫庭昌的話</p>
<p>這裏還有一個尾巴，就是刋登在四月十六日南通的「東南日報」上的一個啓事，茲照錄如次：「孫庭昌敬吿孫敬夫君及小兒平天友好。爲小兒平天事，愚夫婦本吾　主耶穌博愛精神，早已聲明不願追究。茲聞十日上海大公報有署名孫敬夫者，假鄙人口氣投稿，則不勝詫異！茲特鄭重聲明：希平天諸友好勿再以愚夫婦口氣，有所行動，以免外界誤會。此啓」是則「大公報」上自稱平天之父者，究屬何來？眞是一個謎！（十八日）</p>
<p>各團體呼籲</p>
<p>據南通各機關各團體十七日所發快郵，其中述及孫平天失蹤事甚詳，特併錄如次：（署名之機關團體爲陸軍第一〇五師司令部，江蘇省第四區專員公署，中國國民黨南通縣黨部，三民主義靑年團南通分團部，南通縣政府，南通縣地方法院，江蘇省立南通民衆敎育館，南通縣立民衆敎育館，南通縣商會，南通縣農會，南通縣總工會，南通縣敎育會，南通縣新聞記者公會，南通律師公會，南通縣人民自由保障委員會，南通縣醫師公會。</p>
<p>孫平天係僞中央通訊社兼僞江北日報記者，數年在敵人卵翼下，鼓吹和運，人共不齒。僞組織解體後，遂失業，由文化漢奸降爲地方無賴，日前被人暗殺，原因不明，但政府爲維護法紀，已予騐屍緝兇在案，其父孫庭昌有兩子兩女，據其書面聲明，從未到滬，替子呼寃。乃共黨異想天開，化名孫敬夫，冒作孫平天之父，向各報發表言論，並謊稱孫平天是新通報記者，是欲以殺害新聞記者之責任，加諸我方，引起文化界人士之共嗚。居心之險，令人不寒而慄！</p>
<p>孫平天被殺後，商民並無驚擾，報紙竟稱已成恐怖局面。共黨危言聳聽，別有希冀，敬盼滬上新聞碩彥，早日來通視察，以明眞相。</p>
<p>共黨在滬所發新聞，無一言一字近於事實。司馬之心，路人皆知，願我文化新聞各界忠貞賢達，勿爲詭詞所惑，請看勝利以後，各地共黨破壞交通，阻礙接收受降，近更變本加厲，巧立各種流血鬥爭名目，屠殺同胞，難以數計，可惜共區民衆罹其禍者，已識其面目，都市同胞受其惑者，尙爭相慕羨。社會領袖，應各本良知，共謀國家統一，實行眞正民主，發揮超然正論，拯救垂死同胞。炎黃華胃，實利賴之。</p>
<p>蘇北的苦難！</p>
<p>（一）</p>
<p>主筆先生：戰事結束已半年多了，可是慘遭寇軍蹂躪七年的蘇北平原，繼勝利後又面臨着另一個更可怕的敵人—共產黨！這便是現在江蘇半壁省區普遍的處在貧困，飢餓，災荒，與共產黨進行激烈的「鬥爭」之水深火熟中了以以淮（安）淮（陰）來作個例吧：自從勝利消息傳播到這裏後，人民喜躍得直跳，以爲從此可以安居樂業，故天天在盼望着國軍的早日蒞臨。豈知未及半月，而四圍的共產軍步步進迫，圍攻城池，兩旬間先後攻佔了這兩座縣城。從此不僅這兩縣的數十萬人民，對安居樂業之想成了泡影，凡被共軍攻佔的各縣人民，都在遭受着任人宰割，支配，摧殘，蹂躪，搜括……了。種種現象，不一而足。於是蘇北各縣（指爲共軍所佔各縣）的男女同胞，從去年九月間起，大批的向外逃亡流浪，可算無日無之。以目前揚鎭一帶麕集難民之衆（善後救濟總署蘇寗分署定有精確的統計），以及臨時在揚的各縣流亡政府之多，便是一個實例。關於這所謂「解放區」內的一切現狀，已有人詳盡寫述。目前田地荒蕪，人烟稀少，商業衰敗，農村中的耕牛都被刦光了，留着做種子的稻　也被搶光了，一　一　的殘破家園，沒有吃，沒有住，望着雜草叢生的荒　，耕牛，犁粑，種籽都光了。在今年一二月間寳應縣的士紳代表，曾爲着城居的人民（未能流亡出來的）向省當局呼籲，請求聯總蘇寗分署配給物資—麵粉，接濟城內的人民，以免徒作餓莩。這便又是一個實例。——政治協商會議的閉幕，以及停止軍事衝突的協議，迄今已兩月有餘了，而共產黨在蘇北的行爲，仍本其一作風，「我行我素」。當着軍調部准　執行小組在南通的那晚，他們還作進攻白蒲鎮的舉動，「停」在那裏？「協」在那裏？蘇北人民眞是不幸達於萬分的極點了。那年？那月？才能够回到我那可愛的故鄉？我們現在要高呼，要求政府，使國都所在地的江蘇，軍令政令先得統一，拯救百萬人民出水火而登衽席。淮陰流亡者陳靑上。</p>
<p>（二）</p>
<p>主筆先生：作此函時，淚與筆桿齊下，先生不知我蘇北之「善政」也。現在蘇北的共軍已展開了大規模的「鬥爭」，鬥爭之後，即被殺去若干的百姓。在起先，不瞞先生說的，我也是共黨的信仰者，對「領袖」毛澤東先生是懷着「敬意」的，現在可就不然了。我對毛先生當然還異常「尊敬」，尊敬「他」偉大的「人」格，——能讓其屬下如此的做，自已竟像啞子，瞎子，聾子！共黨先逼迫地主將土地權讓給佃農，然後每四畝田，地主向僞「政府」完納谷籽十石左右，地主紛紛逃亡，或鋌而走險爲非作歹以求生活。石港如　一帶，凡非草屋者一律拆除，破壞就是建設，以建立完全平民化之房屋。別人家朝文的明路上走，他們是朝回復原始生活的路上走，這樣下去，民將無以聊生，而政府尙視之漢然！永波上</p>

<p>江西八年以來，雖始終沒有一次大規模的會戰，可是因爲它位居武漢的前衛，三湘血戰之區的右翼與沿海浙粵諸省的後側，同時鄱湖盆地原爲江右著名的榖倉。因此，戰火尙未燃及湘鄂，贛北各縣便遍遭蹂躪，兩湖成爲戰區，浙粵敵宼竄擾之後，贛西北和贛東，贛南不使成爲敵軍迂迴竄擾的地帶，而且亦爲敵宼掠奪軍精物資的補給區，所以其災區的廣闊和受害的程度甚至遠超過其他主要戰塲的省區，全省八十三縣中，便有六十三縣都遭戰禍波及！這裏讓我們且來看看八年戰爭中江西老百姓的血寫成的一筆數字：（據江西省政府統計處民國三十五年一月完成的全省抗戰捐失初步整理簡報）</p>

<p>五·交通損失：全省公路僅存贛果南一小段，全省只剩二十餘輛交通車，大部份都是木炭車。省境內的南潯路，浙贛路全被破壞。說到水運，便使人憶起去年夏季敵沿贛江潰退時，贛江大小輪隻六百餘艘，全被鑿沉的慘景，省境河湖幹堤共長三千餘公里，經敵挖決冲毀，什九殘破，險段決口，比比皆是，假使一旦春水猛漲，必然發生水災！</p>
<p>六·工礦業力面：重工業五廠和輕工業十八廠以及其他民營工業多停止生產。大庾西華山的　，錫礦亦被破壞，鄱陽，樂平，天河，豐城煤礦均停止開掠，一時無力恢復。</p>
<p>總之，八年戰爭中，江西經過敵迭次的竄擾和蹂躪，全省百分之七十六以上的城市和農村，呈現在眼前的是一幅如此悲慘殘破的圖畫！加以今春的糧食問題，流行的疫癘，勢將形成的春荒，又在這幅黯淡的畫面抹上一層濃濃的陰影！</p>
<p>「沒有吃！沒有住！種籽沒，有！耕牛沒有，連耕地的傢伙也完了！還要征購餘糧！唉！叫我們怎樣活下去！」</p>
<p>請聽一聽：這就是全江西苦難的人民要求救濟，要求下活去的呼聲！（李國華寄自南昌）</p>

<p>〔本報重慶專訊〕戰後中國各級敎育之數字統計，曾迭列本報，茲據敎部敎育統計處王萬鍾處長？發表統計心得，於戰地及大後方敎育進展情形，論之綦　，摘要錄下：</p>
<p>就全國統計</p>
<p>（一）就全國言，抗戰前二十五學年度，全國小學兒童數一千八百萬人，中等學生數六十二萬七千人，專科及大學生數四萬一千九百人。抗戰起時數均漲，嗣又漸增，三十二學年度（三十三年七月底），小學生數一千八百萬人，中等學生一百十萬人，專科及大學生（三十四年一月底）七萬八千九百人，與戰前相較，小學生數增加甚微，中等學生增加百分之七十五，專科及大學生數增加百分之八十八。若依民國元年至二十五學年度之平均進度推之，則中等學生數須至民國四十四年，始能達到，專科及大學生數，須至民國四十七年始能達到，今則均因抗戰之故，提前十年以上。</p>
<p>（二）就各省市區分別言，因受戰災深淺之不同，爲（甲）游擊區，包括遼·吉·熱·察·綏·冀·魯·晋·蘇·平·津·靑·京·滬十五省市，（乙）戰區，包括浙·閩·皖·贛·豫·鄂·湘·粵·桂九省，（丙）大後方，包括陝·甘·寧·靑·新·康·川·滇·黔·渝十省市，除游擊區暫無論外，茲姑就戰區及後方省市分連之：</p>
<p>就戰區統計</p>
<p>（子）就戰區九省言，均因有一部分縣區淪爲戰區，故所受打擊相當重大，但除小學外，中等敎育及高等敎育，均有顯著之進步。上列九省，戰前中等學生數原爲二十七萬四千人，三十二學年度增爲五十四萬人，專科及大學生數原爲二萬三千人，至三十二學年度增爲四萬人。若依民國元年度至二十五學年度之平均進度推之，則中等學生須至民國五十三年始達此數，今則均因抗戰之故，提前廿五年以上上</p>
<p>就後方統計</p>
<p>（丑）就大後方十省市言，二十五學年度小學生數原爲三百萬人，三十二學年度增六百七十六萬人，增加一倍以上，中等學生原爲十萬七千人，三十二學年度，增至三十四萬人，增加二倍，專科及大學生原爲三千七百人，三十二學年度增爲一萬六千二百人，增加三倍以上。若依民國元年至二十五學年度平均進度推之、則上列十省市小學生數，須至民國五十五年方能達到，今則提前二十年。中等學生數，須至民國八十五年方能達到，今則提前五十年。專科及大學生數，在二十年度爲四千人，至二十五年度反減爲三千七百人，戰後漸增，至三十二學年度竟激增而爲一萬六千二百人，其提前年數無從計算。（安）</p>

<p>中英足球聯歡賽，昨在逸園舉行，靑白挾其連獲兩大錦標之餘威，又以三比二力挫英海軍聯隊，昨賽由錢市長及英太平洋艦隊總司令福萊塞將軍行開球禮，貴賓席中，除錢市長福萊塞將軍及其隨員外，到有李總司令及蘭，李崇詩將軍，海軍厦門要塞司令劉德浦將軍等，英海軍陣容，除門將勒孚門曾於對合羣戰中，一度漏臉外，餘皆生力軍。靑白秦必高替代嚴士鑫，守門改用黃仕傑，曹秋亭缺席，由羅壽福出塲，比賽上下半塲各四十分鐘，結束時錢市長贈客隊紀念章一錦盒，由福萊塞將軍代領。昨日雖天氣燠熱，已入初夏時序，但球迷仍紛紛雲集，不下八千餘人，情况相當熱烈。</p>
<p>幾成和局</p>
<p>觀昨戰之英海軍，較過去數隊之英海軍爲略佳，然仍不失勇敢有餘，智力不足，而其長力頗有可取，青白先盛後衰，不無有輕敵之意，最後幾成和局，亦云險哉，結果上半時靑白以二對〇凈勝，下半時英海軍反以二對一勝，總結果爲三對二，靑白勝·</p>
<p>二球佔先</p>
<p>比賽於三時開幕，雙方陣容佈定之後，裁判黃仁　，銀角一嗚，錢市長偕福萊塞將軍徐步入塲舉行開球禮，先由鎮市長撥動皮球，交與福萊塞，大戰于焉開始，英軍先得攻勢，靑白陣內，險象環生，幸得吳嚴兩衛，竭力周旋，未十分鐘，嚴士　因足部不舒替出，秦必高入塲，雙方陷於苦戰。廿二分鐘時，李義臣得顧以撤之傳，遙射中的，以一球領前。靑白於是攻勢更盛，卅五分鐘，李司開再施故技，又破網門，二對〇，上半時結束，靑白兩球前導。</p>
<p>青白勝利</p>
<p>下半時英海軍陣容不動，青白則頗多調動，英軍志在報復，挾其長力之足，左衝右突，乃見頭頭是道。十分鐘時，歐文斯拉門，黃仕傑撲救不及，二對一後，靑白不得不加意努力。至廿五分鐘時，李義臣得中衛綫遙傳，得球即射，平而且念，直送敵門而人，靑白又佔前二球，三比一。英軍至此不折不撓，最後爲毛爾射人一球結束，總結果靑白仍以三對二勝。</p>

<h3 id="c83">美國敎育之十大動態（續） <a href="#c83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>— 蔣建白</p>
<p>（五）中學敎育工作經騐的新規劃：近來美國敎育界有一個共同的趨向，即中學敎育要特別注重工作經騐之獲得，大家認爲過去的中學敎育多不切實際，太重視語文方面的訓練，中學畢業者十九未能進大學，而二分之一的中學生未能完成高中階段，城市的中學生佔半數以上，而鄉村的中學校數亦佔半數以上，城市與鄉村的中學生，未能依其可能在校年限與離校後的實際社會需要，予以密切聯緊，學校自身未能完備靑年進入社會時工作經騐的訓練，亦未能利用社會各項事業訓練學生，致社會與個人兩無裨益。近來敎育團體與中等敎育界領袖，規劃了適應城市與鄕村的兩補中學，各就城市與鄕村的工商業及農業家事等　要並運用城市與鄉村現有各業的組識，依照個人的需要與敎育上的必要，採用中心課程的編制，開始即有工作經騐的課程，不過分量較少，其後年級愈高，此項課程愈多，開始即有基本課程，年級愈高，則此項課程愈少，另外設有基本課程與工作經騐課程之選條科目，如在初中第三年完畢後不能續學者，則在第三年即指導其選習興趣相關之工作經騐學科，如高中畢業仍可升學者，即指導其選習基本學科，如是在各個年級，都可適應其就業與升學之要求，而問時在每一個年級都學到與社會密切有關之　作經騐，此係一種彈性適應的繼制，此種學校稱之曰彈性式的混合中學，將來的趨勢有將職業敎育包容的可能，爲一種未來必有的新進展。</p>
<p>（六）年敎育年限之延長：上一節說明中學敎育的新規劃，是注重大部份學生的工作經騐，不過還有許多學生，即使高中畢業，升學者不過百分之七八，其不能升學者，發生了幾種現象：一謀求工作之非易，二因工商各業工作標準與技術提高，靑年有提高敎育上訓練的必要，三因現在高中畢業年齡爲十七八歲，在法律上未足二十歲，尙未正式取得公民權利，在此一過渡的階段，國家有肩負責任的必要。國家爲對靑年負完全敎育上及法律上的責任起見，應予以充分的敎育，故對高中畢業能升學，就業之學生，有免費的中級學院的設立，時間二年，普遍訓練與職業訓練並重，在此時期，學生家庭經濟情形較好時，仍可升入大學三年級，否則即出而就業，其機會較易，現有中級學院六百餘校，內有少數係私人團體辦理，足以說明此一趨勢，正在繼漲增高中。</p>
<p>（七）中級學院與六四四制之推行：上節說明延長靑年敎育年限，設立中級學院，此一趨勢與中學六四四制有連帶關係。現在美國學制六三三佔大多數，八四制仍不少，因中級學院之設立而有六三三二及八四二兩種普遍的現象，最近爲適應需要，謀求調整，而有六四四制的設立，即將中學六年與中級學院二年合爲八年，劃成兩個四年，亦即在原有三年初中上加了一年，在原有三年高中之第二年以後加了兩年，使不能進高中者多得一年的初級敎育，能進高中者多得二年的敎育，主要的目的在提高程度，適應需要。此制已在推行中，頗博得一般教育界之同情，將爲學制上之一新型。</p>
<p>（八）入文主義敎育的提倡：大學與中學敎育，過去都感覺分工太細，把整個的智識裂爲若干碎段，不能見其整體，以致學生知其一不知其二，對做人做事的道理及社會國家的職責，不能見得底細，所以物極必反，便開始重視所謂通才的敎育如哥倫比亞大學師範學院數年以來已將必修之敎育，心理，哲學，政治，社會，經濟等基本學科，改爲一種混合式的通論教程，哈佛大學設立委員會，研究補偏救弊之道，認定大學一二年級須實施通才敎育，以後各年級，由此基本的陶冶，進展爲逐漸的分工，雅魯大學亦同有此認定，在中學方面亦有此必要，分科的職業訓練，必植根於基層的普通訓練。所以最新的敎育目標定爲四大類：即明已，及人（人文），社會的責任，和經濟的責任。此與上述延長青年敎育年限，設立中心敎程，息息相關，將爲未來課程改革之先河。</p>
<p>（九）職業敎育之實質化與普遍化：職業敎育的發展，產生了幾個共同趨向的特質：一，學校與工商聯緊密切。二，工商界能利用學校訓練的人才。三，練注重某一行業之專門技術，而與工商業實際工作人員所備具之條件相符合。四，注意單位的設計，由學生自主之。五，職業指導之精細，眞能配合學生的需要，解決若干個人的與職業的問題。五，師資多由工商界選取，另予敎育上的訓練，故敎學切實。這幾項可稱爲實質化，將來必更加强。其次自一九一七年職業敎育法案通行以來，各州有專管部門，近十年來，撥款增至六十萬萬，學生兩百萬，職業學生之行業組織八千餘，職衆科目除農工商家事外，普及於公務，衛生，交通，安全及社會合作，家庭組織，幼嬰培育等項，凡有益於人生的事業，均將包括於職業敎育之內，此可稱爲普遍化，爲將來職業敎育發展之又一趨勢。又職業敎育的發展與上述的通才敎育，似有對立之嫌，然職業學生係爲不能繼續受通才敎育者而設，自必趨於專門化，但在職業敎育本身方面，最近亦多主張酌施通才訓練，將來頗有接近的趨勢。</p>
<p>（十）推進敎敎師組織與提高專業訓練：敎師職業的淸苦，到處如是。美國大多數敎師的收入，不及一般中級工人，就經濟的立塲言，工商界的發展無止境，而敎師則有一定的限度。所以工人聯合會對付業主之討價還價的板力聲勢浩大，頗吸引了敎師們的同情，不少的敎師加入爲會員，不少敎師團體加入爲聯合體。目的在聯合力量，抗議社會上諸種之不平等，而取得頌導地位。苦干敎育界領袖認爲組織即是力量，敎師應有敎師的組織，敎師的地位與責任和工人的性質不同，敎師應有獨立的組織，以此組織的力量，視每一個事件發生的性質而定應有之聯合和主張。每個組織的自身，應有一個堅强的信念，就是以教育的力量喚起民衆，發揮民力，來消除社會上政治上經濟上的各種壓力，以謀敎育的發展和自身的保障。美國近各若干年來，敎育團體，風起雲湧，其中以敎師聯合會，進步敎育會全國教育聯合會，事業較廣，力量較厚。美國敎育界不少領袖人物參加主持，將來敎師組織的力量，可能居全國領導地位，惟其如此，故教師自身的敎育與工作的努力，爲提高自己地位和增强敎師組織必要的條件。現在各小學敎師幾全爲大學畢業，中學敎師幾全爲硏究院畢業，專業訓練之提高，已成爲事實。組織訓練與服務爲敎師福利保障的原動力，亦爲今後敎師努力的總目標。</p>
<p>上述十點，係就其大者及已有之趨勢而言。他如靑年普遍軍訓，當局及一部份敎育界人士已提出主張，另一部份人士則加以反對，其內在的原因，非軍訓的本身，實不欲聯邦因此而取得敎育行政權，將來視時事需要，有改爲半年或三個月一期，而由聯邦人員與各校協議辦理之可能。又如國際文化的鼓吹，合作敎育的提倡均爲應時的需要尙未成爲定型，故不論列。</p>

<p>外銷豬鬃，佔我國出口貨物之主要部份，戰前我外銷猪鬃年約十萬關担，近年美洲工業極度發展，而豬鬃在工業上之用途甚為廣泛，故美國日前需要甚殷，今後當必更增，美洲所需之豬鬃，素以我國供銷最多，佔我出口總額十分之六七，近聞紐約豬鬃市場因需求殷切，到貨不多，月前市價曾一度由每磅二元五六角（美金）升至三元五角，現以到貨較湧，價亦漸瀉至三元一二角，據營斯業者稱，紐約中國豬鬃在三元左右之價，尚有相當時間之盤旋，近期不致有何變動。</p>
<p>我國經營豬鬃，深獲海外之信譽者，當為四川畜產公司，該公司購製業務，戰時注重西南，勝利後，並積極擴展，華中之漢口，華北之天津，及東南區之上海，均分設機構，近半年來該公司運銷赴美之標準豬鬃，共約五千餘關担，現值各地豬鬃大量登市之際，故該公司正積極進行購製，據該滬公司經理　致祥稱，本年該公司可在國內購製二萬關担運美銷售，最近國內每關担鬃價，渝為六十餘萬元，（以廿七號為標準）漢口七十餘萬元，（以十七號為標準）上海五十四五萬元，（品質較劣仍以十七號為準）天津則因質量較佳，價為七八十萬元。</p>
<p>我國產鬃區域，川·康·滇·黔等省年約二萬餘担，華中及東南區一萬五六千担，華北區七八萬担，總產額當在十萬担以上，現天津一帶購製運銷者，以外商勢力為強，故經營數量亦大，豬鬃裝箱由滬運美，每關担需運費四十餘元美金，（如須轉運費則較重）出口稅為百分之〇·七五，自滬出口，另加黃浦之附加稅等約百分之〇·二五，共需納稅約百分之一，該公司由渝運滬之豬鬃，尚在運輸途中者，有二三千担，聞全滬豬鬃存底現極薄弱，待運出口者僅有一千餘担，故現在滬市鬃價標準，仍須視產區及紐約銷場為轉移。</p>
<p>〔又訊〕關於經營出口豬鬃廠商，日前請求當局減免豬鬃出口稅率一事，茲據確悉，財政部已將是項請求文件，交與國定稅則委員會再行審定，斟酌減免，日內將明令公佈。</p>

<p>— Jack　London原著魯莽譯</p>
<p>〔黑人決不會了解白人，白人也決不會了解黑人，直到黑人叫黑人而白人叫白人的名稱消滅　爲止。」</p>
<p>伍德華德船長這樣說。我們　在亞比亞査理羅伯次酒店的會　室裏，在長久地喝阿布哈曼得，是爲上面所說起了的査理羅伯次所爲我們調合而同我們一起喝的，他宣說這種調合法直接傳自斯提汾茲，爲發明了這種阿布哈曼得酒聞名是正在他爲尼羅河決　所迫促的時候——對於『成就　土穆的啓拆涅』有責任的就是這個斯汾茲，而他死於雷狄斯密　的包圍中。</p>
<p>上了年紀的伍德華德船長長得又胖又矮，經過了熱帶太陽的四十年的曬灼，而他有一對我從一個男子所看到過的最美麗的水汪汪的褐色眼睛，是在講他的淵博的經騐。在他秃的頭頂上的縱　交錯的創瘢宣示着一種同黑人的斧鉞的密接，而在告知着有過同樣的密接的是他右邊頭頸的前面與後面，在那裏顯有有一次爲一支箭所貫穿過的洞眼。依照他的解釋，他在那件事情上有些倉最　那支箭他無法拔出來—他覺得他一時不能把箭頭脫掉，而把前桿像它射進來那樣抽了出去。在這個時候他是薩丕伊號的副船長，那艘大輪船是在從西方裝運了工人開向薩摩亞羣島的德國殖民地去。</p>
<p>「一半的糾紛是出於白人的愚　，」羅伯次說，停下來從他的玻璃杯喝了一大口酒，並以親熟的字眼駡了一句薩摩亞酒童。「要是一個白人肯讓他自已稍稍了解一些黑人在轉些什麼念頭的話，大半的紛擾就會消除了。」</p>
<p>「我看見過幾個人，他們宣說他們是了解黑人的。」伍德華德船長應答，「而我總是注意到他們就是第一個被吃了的。只要看看新基尼和新赫布里底的傳敎師—厄羅芒加的殉敎者之島，以及一切其餘的。只要看看奧地利亞的遠征團，他們在所羅門羣島，在瓜達爾加那的叢林裏，被切割成一片片。還只要看看商人自已，有了二十年的經騐的，在自誇決不會有黑人找到他們的頭上來，而他們的頭顱却到今天還裝飾在那些獨木舟屋的橡子上。還有老約翰西門茲——在美拉尼西亞的未開化的邊境上躭了二十六年，賭咒說他像懂得一本書一樣地懂得黑人，而他們決不會於他不利，而他在新佐治亞馬洛服湖邊頭完結了，他的頭給一個黑女人和一個只有一條腿的老黑人（還有一條腿在他潛入水裏去捕火藥炸了的魚的時候，落進了一條　魚的嘴裏去了）鋸了下來。還有別力窩欠，有着專殺黑人的可怖的名聲，是一個惡魔見了也怕得要命的人物。我記得躺在新愛爾蘭小角，你知道，那時有黑人偸取了半罐出售的烟葉—使他受到大約三塊半金圓的損失。他要復仇了，用槍打死了大個黑人。搗毀了幾只他們戰爭用獨木舟，還燒去了兩個村莊。也是在小角，四年以後，他連同他所雇用着釣海參的五十個布科小廝受到了出其不意的襲擊。在五分鐘以內，除了三個小厮搖了一只獨木舟逃走以外，他們死得乾乾凈凈。不要對我講什麼了解黑人的話。白人的使命是開墾世界，而這對於他是足够繁忙的了。他究竟還有什麼時間可多下來去了解黑人呢？」</p>
<p>「正是這樣，」羅伯次說。「到底，要去了解黑人似乎有些並不是必需的。白人的開墾世界就是他愚蠢的直接結果—」</p>
<p>「並把懷怕上帝放進黑人的心裏去。」伍德華德船長脫口而出。「也許你說得不錯，羅伯次。也許使他成功的是他的愚蠢，而他愚蠢的一個現象，一定就是他的不能够了解黑人。可是有一件事是可確定的，就是白人不能不統治黑人，不管他了解不了解他們。這是不可避免的，這是命運。」</p>
<p>「自然白人是不可避免的—這是黑人的命運，」羅伯次插入說。「吿訴白人在什麼湖底裏有珍珠的蛤殼，在裏紛聚着一萬叫號的吃人肉人，他也會單獨向那裏前進，只帶五六個夏威夷潛水者和一只計時準確的鬧鐘，大家像沙甸魚似地緊擠在一只輕便的五噸的雙桅舟中。輕輕說一聲在北極有一處黃金的積藏，那同一的不可避免的白皮膚生物就會立刻出發，隨備了鋤和鏟，一邊鹹猪肉，以及一架最新應市的搖軸—還有呢，他會到那裏去了。向他吐露在地獄的赤熱的堡壘上有金剛鑽，白人先生就會去大鬧堡壘，而使老撒旦親自從事鋤與鐘的工作。那都是由愚蠢與不可避免所造成的。」</p>
<p>「可是我不明白黑人對於那——那不可避免會怎樣想，」我說。</p>
<p>伍德華德船長在沉靜地笑着。他的眼睛裹有着一種回憶的光芒。</p>
<p>「我正在不明白馬琉的黑人們對於那一個不可避免的白人，是我們在公爵夫人號上開向那裏去的時候在我們的船上的，那時以至現在會在怎樣想。」他解釋道。</p>
<p>羅伯次又調合了三杯阿布哈曼得。</p>
<p>「那是二十年以前的事情。他的名字叫薩克思多夫。他實在是我所看見過的最愚蠢的人，可是他是像死亡一樣地不可避免的。那個傢伙只有一件事情能做，而那件事情是開槍。我記得我第一次遇見他——就在亞比亞這里，二十年以前。那還在你沒有出來的時候哩，羅伯次。我是睡在荷蘭人亨利的旅館裏，就是現在是市塲那邊。所到過他沒有？他從偸運槍械給反叛者弄到了好些錢，售去了他的旅館，而正在六個星期以後在悉德尼被槍打死，在一次酒店裏的鬧事中。（未完）</p>

<p>— 趙淸閣</p>
<p>麗雲不回答，只把那封信遞給了墨太太。</p>
<p>墨太太不認得字，少不得叫了寳鈴來念給她聽。上面寫着：</p>
<p>「我現在和石玉樓回到北京去！我不願意吿訴小雲知道，也更不能帶她同走。好在有你在這裏，所以我特地向你托孤，請念及我們姊妹的情誼，代我扶養她。日後總有報答之日，爲恐招搖，恕未面刮。」</p>
<p>原來這是一封托孤的信，寳鈴念完，吃驚地向麗雲叫着：</p>
<p>「怎麽？你媽逃走啦？」</p>
<p>麗雲聽見寳鈴這樣問她，更痛哭起來了。</p>
<p>「少說話！」墨太太向寶鈴啐了一口。抱住麗雲安慰地說：「不哭，小雲！今兒就搬到姨媽家裏來住、以後姨媽就是你的媽！姨媽會疼你的。」說罷，又問麗雲：「這封信是媽給你的嗎？你爸爸曉得不？」</p>
<p>麗雲這才開了口。她搖搖頭嗚咽地說：</p>
<p>「不，這封信是爸爸給我的，媽是今天早晨走的。媽走的時候，爸爸其實看見了。但是爸爸說他裝作沒看見。媽把信留在我的床上，出去以後，爸爸就叫醒了我，吿訴我：「媽是不會再回來了」。吩咐我拿着這封信來找姨媽。我便立刻要去追媽回來，可是爸爸不許，他說：「媽走的好，早走更好！」</p>
<p>「奇怪，你爸爸這是什麼意思呢？他願意你媽早走，難道他還想再娶一個三太太四太太不成？」墨太太忿忿地說。</p>
<p>「翁伯伯總是上午睡覺的，怎麼今兒偏偏起來的那樣早呢？」寶玲一邊插嘴地問聽雲。</p>
<p>「不知道，」麗雲也莫名其妙地回答寶鈴。</p>
<p>墨太太這時心裏很矛盾，她不反對翁二太太的走，而且她早料到總會有這麼一天。翁二太太也曾有意無意地向她暗示過。但她感到惜別！因爲翁二太太和她相處了十餘年，如今驟然離開了她，自然難免想念！同時她想到自己以後的日子，將因此更加寂寞！所以她又有些自私地怨恨石玉樓了！</p>
<p>也許墨太太還有點兒嫉妬翁二太太，她曾悄悄對自己說：如果她再年靑十年，她不是也可以和翁二太太一樣——「走」了之了嗎？可是她老了，沒有人會願意帶她走。還有，就是她的兒子已經很大，她不能不要兒子。她一生的希望，全都寄托在兒子的身上了，她得等着享兒子的福，她要從兒子那裏取得她半生犧牲的代價。雖然眼前，兒子她只能佔有一半，另一半即被墨老爺侵略了，然而她相信墨老爺死後，兒子終究會屬於她的。想到這裏，墨太太又悄悄欣尉地快活起來了。這時她一抬顯，看見寶鈴恰巧站在她的身邊，她看見寳鈴白淨的面龐，明亮的眸子，覺得無限的安慰，無限的喜愛！於是，她用數日以來，從沒有過的和藹口吻，親切地向寶玲叫着：</p>
<p>「寶玲！」墨太太茫然地喊了一聲，又怪沒意思的。靈機一動，便找了個話岔溫柔地說。「你去到乾爸爸那裏，把你表妹妹的舖蓋拿過來，吿訴你翁伯伯，就說媽留你雲妹妹長住在咱們家裏。」</p>
<p>寳鈴答應着走出去。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Intensified Peace Talks: Marshall Calls on Chairman Chiang Yesterday; Also Meets with Zhou Enlai to Exchange Views <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>[United Press, Chongqing, 23rd] General Marshall met today with Zhou Enlai, the Communist representative on the Military Three-Person Committee, for two hours of "free exchange of views." Marshall then received General Xu Yongchang, who signed the Japanese surrender agreement on the USS Missouri in Tokyo, and subsequently met with Chairman Chiang. Marshall will meet with Chairman Chiang and Zhou Enlai again on the 24th, but officials have made no indication when he will convene a meeting of the Three-Person Committee. Reports say that the Military Three-Person Committee will reconvene once General Chen Cheng returns to Chongqing. It is understood that Marshall's discussions today largely concerned the matter of Communist representatives going to Nanjing. It is expected that Chairman Chiang, Marshall, and Zhou Enlai will go to Nanjing this weekend.</p>
<p>[United Press, Chongqing, 23rd] Special Envoy Marshall intensified "peace conference" efforts today, separately calling on Chairman Chiang and meeting with Zhou Enlai for talks. Marshall's aides did not disclose the progress of the talks. However, a Communist spokesman stated: "Mr. Ma and Mr. Zhou have frankly exchanged views." Observers believe that the lack of clarity in the explanation of the original ceasefire agreement between the Nationalists and Communists necessitates a new agreement, and only a clearly worded written agreement can satisfy both sides.</p>
<p>[United Press, Chongqing, 23rd] A certain official of the National Government stated today: a compromise solution for the Northeast problem is possible. The method is for the government to hand over control of "certain parts," and the Communists to withdraw from Changchun, Harbin, and other large cities, so that National troops can move freely along the railway line between Shenyang, Changchun, and Harbin. The Communist proposal is that the Communist forces should control the entire territory northeast of Changchun, ceding the southern part of the nine eastern provinces to the National Government.</p>
<p>Niu Xianming to Fly to Shenyang Tomorrow; To Discuss Dispatching Small Team to Changchun</p>
<p>[This Newspaper, Beiping, 23rd] The newly taken over Northeast is now engulfed in artillery fire. The Northeast Executive Team, centered on American personnel, stumbles on the edge of the battlefield and runs into obstacles everywhere. The people of the Northeast, including those in North China, have a glimmer of hope for peace, namely when Marshall will arrive in the Northeast with his bag of tricks. Although the defense battle of the Changchun Security Team has ended, the Executive Headquarters still plans to send a Changchun team. This matter is currently being discussed by the three parties of the Shenyang Central Team. However, principal and technical issues have not yet been fully agreed upon. Niu Xianming, Deputy Chief of Staff representing the government in the Executive Headquarters, is scheduled to fly to Shenyang on the 25th to discuss the matter of dispatching an additional Changchun team and to convey the government's views.</p>
<p>[French News Agency, Beiping, 23rd] The four teams of the newly dispatched Northeast branch of the Military Mediation Department are still at a standstill. Team 28 is currently en route between Kaiyuan and Siping. Team 29 is stranded in Fushun. Teams 27 and 30 remain in Shenyang.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 23rd] The Nanjing Provisional Consultative Council held its 27th general meeting, discussing appeals to the National Government, Special Envoy Marshall, and the Communists, calling for adherence to the agreement. The meeting also condemned the Communist obstruction of the National Army's takeover of the Northeast, which was passed by the general meeting.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper, Jinan, 21st] Representatives from all sectors of society and people's organizations, at a joint farewell gathering for National Assembly representatives yesterday, unanimously requested that the current chaotic situation in Shandong Province be reported to the assembly, hoping that the Communist Party would immediately return the military to the nation and no longer use it as a tool for slaughtering compatriots, fighting for political power, and dividing territories.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Taiyuan, 23rd] The first meeting of the Shanxi Provisional Consultative Council closed on the 23rd. The meeting lasted fourteen days and passed over seventy proposals. Governor Yan, in his closing remarks, put forward three goals: (1) to reflect the people's opinions and communicate political and civil relations; (2) to remedy political deficiencies and safeguard political powers; and (3) to work together to overcome the current difficulties. The council also unanimously passed a resolution yesterday, requesting the government and the Military Mediation Department to stop the Communist army from capturing Changchun and attacking the National Army, and sending a separate telegram to Marshal Marshall.</p>

<p>[This Newspaper, Hangzhou, 23rd] Since Ma Yinchu came to Hangzhou, he has been very busy with speaking engagements. Mr. Ma spoke freely with this newspaper's reporter about economic issues. He believes that political democracy must precede economic democracy. Foreign exchange policy depends on fiscal policy, which in turn depends on military consolidation policy, which in turn depends on industrial policy, which in turn depends on tariff protection policy. Therefore, Mr. Ma strongly advocates tariff protection to maintain the prosperity of Chinese industry.</p>

According to Wei, the office has three tasks: (A) to publicize government orders and strengthen cooperation between the government and the people; (B) to communicate inter-provincial relations and promote international publicity; (C) to raise cultural standards. It is expected to be officially established at the beginning of next month.</p>

<h3 id="e5">Gratitude to Dr. Savage <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>On today's road of national construction after China's victory, Dr. John Lucian Savage, this 68-year-old American hydraulic expert, has overcome long journeys and is currently returning to our country. He has come to China this time to continue pushing forward the Yangtze River Dam Project (Y·V·A·) that he designed for China. We are undoubtedly grateful to this old man Savage, who is working to create a happy and prosperous nation for China's 450 million people. In the future, if his plan is realized, his achievements in controlling China's waters will be no less than those of Yu the Great. In addition to expressing our highest respect to him, we would like to outline what we know about the Yangtze River Dam Project to provide the people of our country with an understanding.</p>
<p>After Dr. Savage recently came to China, he went to Wuhan for inspection and has reached concrete decisions with the authorities: aerial surveys of the upper reaches of the Yangtze River to the entire Three Gorges area are expected to begin next month, and the main design work of the Y·V·A project may be completed within about half a year. The preparatory work for social and economic surveys related to the plan will also begin soon.</p>
<p>The origin of this globally shocking Yangtze River Dam Project did not begin today. As early as June of the 33rd year of the Republic, during the War of Resistance, Dr. Savage began drafting it on the blueprint of the American T·V·A· in a small building on the banks of the Longxi River. If this plan can be completed, it can be compared with the magnificent construction and great achievements of the Tennessee Valley Authority (T·V·A·) in the United States. The United States has T·V·A·; China also has Y·V·A·. This is a bright and brilliant road leading us to prosperity and happiness.</p>
<p>Let's compare the American T·V·A· with the Chinese Y·V·A·:</p>
<p>First, in terms of hydropower generation: If the Y·V·A· project is successful, its power generation capacity can reach 10.056 million kilowatts, which is more than 19 times greater than the power generation capacity of the Soviet Union's Dnieper Hydroelectric Plant, and more than five times greater than the American Grand Coulee Dam. Its power transmission network, centered on Yidu, extends east to Nanjing, west to Chengdu and Xufu, south to Guiyang and Guilin, and north to Tianshui and Taiyuan, forming a vast power transmission network covering the Southwest, Northwest, West China, Central China, and East China. Such a vast power transmission range can be called the world's largest. The Yangtze River Dam project and the future national defense and people's livelihood of our country will inevitably be inseparable and closely related. After the completion of this plan, the development of special minerals in Sichuan, Hunan, Guizhou, and Yunnan provinces, as well as regional construction and industrialization, can obtain a large amount of cheap hydropower generated by the Yangtze River Dam.</p>
<p>Let's first look at the achievements of the Tennessee Valley Authority (T·V·A·) in hydropower generation. The maximum power capacity of T·V·A is over 3 million kilowatts, and the current installed available power is 2,216,842 kilowatts (1945 statistics), but it can already help industry with power, electrify agriculture, increase the economic welfare of the general public, and increase the national income of the rural population, which is truly countless. In 1943, power users included federal, state, and municipal agencies, cooperatives, industries, electrical industries, villages, and general residents. The electricity fee is cheap, averaging 3.8 yuan per kilowatt-hour, and residential electricity is even cheaper. In 1943, each residential user in the United States used an average of 1,044 kilowatt-hours, costing 3.66 yuan per kilowatt-hour. The Tennessee Valley residential user used an average of 1,598 kilowatt-hours with the electric fee of 1.96 yuan per kilowatt-hour. In 1943, the average electric bill across the United States per residential user was 3820 USD, while in the Tennessee Valley each residential only pay 3130 USD. Electricity usage was increased the most by 55.5 percent, yet the cost of electricity was reduced by 22 percent. Ten years ago, the electricity in Tennessee River Valley was only 400 kWh per person, and now increase six times (China only have 5 kWh per person), this demonstrates the great economic value of electricity.</p>
<p>Second, in terms of improving agriculture: If the Y·V·A· plan is successful, its massive volume of the Yangtze River Dam can irrigate 60 million acres of farmland and normalize water levels, thus eliminating water and drought disasters. The Southwest, Northwest, and West China provinces are mostly plateaus and hilly areas, with many mountains and a special climate. Therefore, the cultivation of crops in various places is different from other places. Since ancient times, Chinese farmers have relied on the weather to eat, and a slight lack of rain can lead to drought. As a result, Chinese agriculture is still dominated by nature and has not been scientifically improved. After the success of Y·V·A·, agricultural improvement will inevitably take the path of the scientific era. Due to the achievements of the Y·V·A· project, China can also achieve agricultural electrification and agricultural technologization in the future. Moreover, agricultural industrialization must first have the conditions of electrification before it can advance to scientific and mechanized.</p>
<p>Let's look again at the achievements of the Tennessee Valley Authority (Y·V·A·) in improving agriculture: Ten years ago, eight or nine out of ten farms and farmhouses in the Tennessee River basin did not have electric lighting equipment, so there was no question of agricultural electrification. In 1933, there was one electrified farm in every 28 farms, and in 1943, there was one electrified farm in every five farms. 85,000 farms in the Tennessee River basin are mostly electrified. Residents now use electric lights; they also use electricity for farming and preserving crops. The electricity of the Tennessee Valley Authority is retailed and distributed through 128 power companies, giving great convenience to rural areas and farmers. The organization also encourages farmers to form farm ten-electricity cooperatives, and forestry also benefits from electricity, increasing business. The Authority also established "electric refrigeration cooperatives," where each family has a refrigerator, using electricity to refrigerate miscellaneous items all year round. Regarding improvements in new agricultural technology, the most important thing for the improvement of agriculture is soil conservation due to topsoil loss, resulting in barren land. Y·V·A· established a fertilizer plant at Wilson Dam, mass-producing concentrated fertilizers, especially phosphates. Since the success of phosphate fertilizer manufacturing technology, it has been promoted to general farmers, who accept the technology of new agriculture, and the farmers believe in the effect of phosphate fertilizer, so they organized the "Agricultural Improvement Association" to enhance the scientificization of agriculture.</p>
<p>Third, in terms of transportation and shipping: If the Y·V·A· plan can be completed, then in terms of transportation and shipping, 10,000-ton seagoing vessels can directly navigate between Chongqing and Shanghai, and travel 1,200 miles upstream to the west along the Yangtze River. Also, in the middle of Yichang, there is no need to change boats. The riverbed structure of the main stream of the Yangtze River upstream to Yichang is completely different from the Sichuan River. Therefore, each voyage between Shanghai and Chongqing is carried out in sections, and cannot be directly from Shanghai to Chongqing. As a result, cargo transportation is very difficult, and the increase in freight is particularly uneconomical. During the westward relocation of the National Government and the return to the capital after the victory, we deeply felt the pain that segmented voyages could not reach directly. The water level of the Yangtze River from Yishangyou varies in depth, with dangerous rapids and shipwrecks constantly occurring. The water quality is dangerous, and stone reefs are scattered in the river, making navigation difficult. During the severe winter season, the Sichuan River upstream Xuyiyu line even has a small motorboat of dozens of tons at the place of suspension. After the success of the Y·V·A· plan, the dangerous conditions of the past will be swept away, and the shipping between Shanghai and Chongqing will be unblocked. (Continued on page 2)</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Tianjin, 23rd] A huge air transportation of narcotics case has recently been solved here. The successful investigation was due to the comprehensive cooperation between the US military and our police and security forces. Nine criminals and opium worth 90,000 US dollars have been seized. On February 10th of this year, a man named Reidel induced three US military ambulance personnel to transport a large amount of opium to Shanghai by air, promising to make a fortune. The three personnel were not tempted and reported the matter to their superiors. They were ordered to continue to deal with Reidel nominally. The US military set up a feigned situation and ordered a pilot to participate. Until the 30th of last month, Reidel gave nine bags of opium to the pilot to prepare for air transport to Shanghai. Our police and security forces then assisted the US military police in arresting them. A total of ten drug traffickers were captured in the case in Tianjin and Beiping, including five White Russians and five Chinese merchants. The entire case has now been handed over to our side for trial.</p>

<h3 id="e12">In Memory of Changchun (Part 1) <a href="#e12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>
<p>— Written by Fang Ren in Shenyang</p>
<p>On March 29th, the reporter flew away from Changchun. Two hours later, the plane landed at Jinzhou Airport. The people who flew to Jinzhou on the same plane all breathed a sigh of relief. Those who liked to talk blurted out: "Now we can be considered safe."</p>
<p>Those who have lived in Changchun for a long time boasted that Changchun is a blessed land. The Northeast has experienced many storms, and there have been stories of blood-stained rivers and mountains in other areas, but Changchun has been able to sneak through the chaos. For example, after the Japanese surrendered on August 15th last year, there was no scene of blood flowing like pestles. In mid-November last year, when the headquarters withdrew from Changchun, it looked like a disaster was imminent, but in the end it was able to turn danger into safety. However, now, in the sunny March, the abundant spring breeze has failed to blow green leaves out of the bald branches, and the snow on the wilderness has melted, and when the white land shows its true face, this blessed land is full of gunpowder.</p>
<p>When the sovereignty of the Northeast began to be taken over, it should have been a happy event for the Chinese people, but the facts tell us that on March 13th, the Soviet troops left Siping, and on the 17th, someone besieged the provincial government, using rocket launchers (according to the investigation, the other party had four) to destroy the power grid defense works set up by Chairman Liu Handong, and the power plant where the power supply was located, causing Siping to fall into chaos. Before the 17th, Siping was already in a state of being surrounded. The tigers waiting for an opportunity to move were preparing their weapons, and as soon as the opportunity came, they would act. Everyone could see this step. Finally, the curtain was raised before midnight on the 17th. The provincial government had less than 4,000 people, and the enemy had more than 20,000, which was already a disadvantage in terms of numbers. The security team and police, who had less than 4,000 people, were still in training, so it was inevitable that they would lose. Liu Handong and others were moved from Siping to Lishu, and then from Lishu to Siping. Later, they felt that some of them could be allowed to return to Changchun. On the 25th, Liu Handong and 14 others left Siping by car. They were supposed to arrive that day, but they were kept overnight at Gongzhuling (120 li from both Gongzhuling and Siping). At 10:50 pm on the 26th, the stars were tied to the sky, and the city of Changchun was as silent as if it were dead before they returned to the Mantan Building. From the 17th to the 26th, a total of ten days, the faces of the 14 people who came back were haggard and pale, and they really had nothing but themselves. The most obvious was Xu Nai, the secretary-general of the provincial government, because he was a friend I met in Changchun last year.</p>
<p>When Liu Handong and his party of 14 returned, no one in the building was asleep, and they greeted them with heartfelt condolences. After Chairman Liu saw everyone and sat down, he slowly said that when they left Changchun on January 8th and arrived in Siping, a certain unit in Siping moved from the city to the suburbs. The Siping that the provincial government took over was in a state of being surrounded from the day it was taken over. A certain unit transported coal from east to west on the Siping-Taonan Road through the city. Government personnel could only watch the arrogant locomotive roar and pass by. The scene that had been expected for a long time was staged on the 17th. The crowd was outnumbered, and the ammunition and food were exhausted. Siping finally fell into chaos. Chairman Liu said that when he left Changchun, the basic military force he brought to Siping was: one company of security team, 100 rifles, and 30,000 rounds of ammunition, that's all. Before going to bed, Secretary-General Xu also talked with the reporter privately for a while. When he said goodbye to the reporter, he wanted to find a few sleeping pills. He said: "I haven't gotten a bit of rest in the past ten days. I'm afraid I won't be able to sleep." Although he said that, the reporter didn't have this thing, so he had to express his apology to him.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper Nanjing 23rd Dispatch] President of the Executive Yuan, Song Ziwen, along with his wife and Secretary-General Jiang Menglin, arrived in Beijing from Chongqing at 2 PM today. When the special plane of these two top Executive Yuan leaders landed at the Guanghua Gate airport outside the city, the welcoming party was exceptionally small. It is reported that Song's arrival was earlier than generally expected, as today, Tuesday, was originally the date for the Executive Yuan's routine meeting. Slightly earlier than Song's special plane, the planes of several senior officials, including Party-State elder Ding Weifen, Minister of Food Xu Yan, and Minister of Judicial Administration Xie Guansheng, arrived at the Minggugong airport. All of these signs prove that the center of gravity of both current affairs and politics has indeed shifted from Chongqing to Beijing. It is reported that the Executive Yuan routine meeting, which was originally scheduled to be held today, may be convened in Beijing in the coming days with a temporary notice. President Song left Chongqing at 10:20 AM this morning, taking Marshal Marshall's special plane, which flew from Chongqing to Beijing, taking three hours and forty minutes, setting a new flight record between Beijing and Chongqing.</p>

<h3 id="e15">Sino-French Military Conflict in Hanoi: Our Side Has Lodged a Protest, Demanding the French Army Punish the Culprits and Compensate for the Losses <a href="#e15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Hanoi 21st Dispatch] (Delayed) At 3:30 PM on the 21st, a French military vehicle collided with a Chinese military heavy vehicle near Hoan Kiem Lake in downtown Hanoi. While both sides were stopping to investigate responsibility, the French army suddenly opened fire, killing one of our driver soldiers. A conflict immediately broke out between the two sides. Gunfire erupted in the city, causing great disruption. The headquarters of our 53rd Army, citing that our side had already handed over defense responsibilities and was not responsible for maintaining public order, immediately contacted the Dong Institute and notified all parties by telephone to refrain from opening fire. The conflict soon ceased. At this time, Vietnamese revolutionaries suddenly took the opportunity to attack. Around 4 PM, the gunfire became even denser. Vietnamese near the Hanoi branch of the Central News Agency even opened fire on French residences. After liaison officers from the Chinese, French, and Vietnamese sides rushed to various locations and ordered a ceasefire, the gunfire subsided around 5 PM. According to the commander of the 53rd Army Corps, after the incident occurred, all three sides ordered their troops not to open fire. However, some of our soldiers at guard posts and stationed at railway stations were attacked.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Hanoi 22nd Dispatch] The Sino-French military vehicle collision on the afternoon of the 21st has come to an end after being handled by the authorities of both sides. During the conflict on the 21st, the French army dispatched several tanks to patrol the city and fire their guns, reaching as many as five conflict sites. French tanks also fired a shot near Hoan Kiem Lake, and some French soldiers opened fire on our Youth Daily newspaper office. The trees in the courtyard were hit. In addition to the four soldiers killed at the collision site, fifteen of our soldiers were killed in various locations in the city. The number of casualties on the French side is unknown. The First Front Army Headquarters, considering that the French army has already taken over the defense of Hanoi and is responsible for maintaining public order, has protested to the French army commander, demanding the punishment of the culprits and compensation for losses, in order to clarify the responsibilities of both sides, representatives from both the Chinese and French sides have been organized a committee to conduct an investigation.</p>

<h3 id="e17">Xie Guansheng Arrives in Beijing from Chongqing: Trials of Traitors are Being Handled Impartially Everywhere; Living Conditions of Judicial Personnel to Be Improved Soon <a href="#e17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Nanjing 23rd Dispatch] Minister of Judicial Administration Xie Guansheng flew to Beijing from Chongqing at 3 PM on the 23rd. He said: Public and rapid trial of traitors is a consistent policy of the government. The handling of this matter by courts nationwide is not a matter of personal grudges, but a manifestation of national justice. In recent times, the work of trying traitors has been widely carried out everywhere, and all cases have been handled impartially. I personally feel gratified. However, "thoroughly eradicating evil" is indeed the essence of the judicial spirit, and "raising up the wronged and placing them among the upright" is also the essence of judicial protection of human rights. Therefore, I hope that all colleagues in law enforcement nationwide can encourage each other with this. Xie then stated: The central government is extremely concerned about the living conditions of judicial personnel. Recently, I have discussed concrete improvement measures with President Song, which will be realized in the near future. In response to reporters' questions about the situation of prisons in the recovered areas, Xie said: The wartime destruction was too severe, and restoring them to their former appearance will not be accomplished overnight. The ministry has formulated a step-by-step implementation plan, starting with major cities and then spreading to the localities. Recently, the government has strictly enforced the prohibition of drugs and opium in the recovered areas, and courts at all levels should do their best to assist local authorities in completing this important task.</p>

<p>Expanding the Teacher Appreciation Movement</p>
<p>Given the poverty of teachers in this county, all sectors are expanding the teacher appreciation movement. It is stipulated that from May 1st to the 7th, it will be Teacher Appreciation Week. The goal is to raise 20,000,000 yuan to subsidize teachers, with each teacher receiving approximately 100,000 yuan. The fundraising targets include students' parents, the Benevolent Relief Association, chambers of commerce, various businesses, and entertainment venues, which will also collect teacher appreciation donations. It is hoped that small contributions will accumulate into a large sum. The education authorities have formed a committee to be responsible for everything.</p>

<p>Cessation of Inspections at Stations and Wharves</p>
<p>Commander Yan of the garrison troops, in order to discuss public security in the urban area and gather collective wisdom, convened the third city defense meeting at the regimental headquarters on the 17th. It was decided to cease inspections at city gates, stations, and wharves to facilitate travelers.</p>

<p>Major Disputes in the General Survey of House Tax</p>
<p>Lu Shousheng, the Bao head of the second Bao in Zhongyi Town in this county, accompanied four tax collectors, including Lu Xu from the Local Autonomous Donation and Tax Office, on the 17th of this month to conduct a general survey of house taxes door-to-door. These officials arbitrarily estimated the value of houses, regardless of the size, quality of construction, or rental income of the residents. They then forced residents to sign and stamp application forms. For example, Zhu Wang's one-story house along the street was insisted upon being assessed as a two-story building because it had a mezzanine. Gu Daisheng rented two rooms for 12,000 yuan in legal tender per month, which was five times the original rent. The rent for Gu Jusheng's household was also more than ten times the original rent. Furthermore, it was publicly stated that rent should be calculated based on the price of rice, which caused major rental disputes. The county council raised this issue in the general meeting, demanding that the valuation procedure be fair and reduce the burden on the people.</p>

<p>The All-Virtuous Widows' Hall to Be Dissolved</p>
<p>The All-Virtuous Widows' Hall in this county, established during the Kangxi and Yongzheng reigns of the late Qing dynasty, has a history of one hundred years of providing relief to poor widows. The board of directors now believes that in this era of social progress and equal rights for men and women, the expenditure on this type of old ethical teaching is unnecessary. Therefore, it was brought up for discussion at a meeting held on the 21st. It was resolved to dissolve the hall. Except for poor widows over the age of 45, who will be merged into the Universal Relief Hall (i.e., the Old People's Hall) for continued care, all others will be given 100,000 yuan in severance pay and dismissed. It is said that these measures will be implemented in the shortest possible time.</p>

<p>Qualification Examination for Township and Town Cadres</p>
<p>In order to improve the organization of townships and towns, the Jiaxing County Government convened township and town cadres and clerks on the 20th at the Huguang Central Elementary School for a qualification examination. A total of 88 people attended. The examination was supervised by Zhu Bingjun, the head of the Civil Affairs Section. The examination was divided into subjects such as Mandarin, Party Principles, Practical Writing, and Autonomous Regulations. Oral examinations and physical examinations were also conducted. All examination papers are currently being graded. It is determined that the passing score is 60 for cadres and 50 for clerks. Township and town personnel who have not yet taken the examination will be given another opportunity to take the examination at a later date.</p>

<p>Villagers Beat a Fake Clerk to Death</p>
<p>Yu Wusheng, a 52-year-old villager from Daru Township in Zhenze District of this county, had served as a clerk in the puppet township office for many years, using his position to extort money from the farmers. Farmers resented him deeply. Recently, he did not restrain himself, which aroused public outrage. On the 13th of this month, more than a hundred people gathered and beat him to death, throwing his body into the river. Upon receiving the report, the county government stated that while it is true that traitors and puppets deserve to be punished, it must be done in accordance with legal procedures. Recently, there have often been ignorant villagers who, in a fit of anger, hurt people and destroy houses, which not only undermines the law but also affects public security. Yesterday, a public notice was issued to strictly prohibit such acts, and it is hoped that people will step up the reporting of traitors and puppets so that they can be severely punished and justice can be served.</p>
<h3 id="e21">Thank You Dr. Savage (Continued from the First Page) <a href="#e21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>Let us look at the achievements of the Tennessee Valley Authority (T.V.A.) in the area of transportation and navigation. The Tennessee River in the United States is a strange river that flows backwards from south to north. For centuries, it has taken countless lives and destroyed countless fields. In particular, the floods of 1879, 1886, and 1917 were the worst and remain a permanent fear in the minds of the residents. The residents of the Tennessee River Valley did not engage in afforestation, causing the 52 inches of rainfall to flow on the surface without penetrating the ground, creating the potential for flooding. The soil-retaining vegetation on the ground was insufficient to curb the flow of floodwaters, and the precious topsoil was washed away, clogging the waterways and causing inundation. The Tennessee River Valley area, like the upper reaches of the Yangtze River basin, has many hilly pastures, woodlands, and farmlands, as well as coal and iron deposits underground. Since the establishment of the Tennessee Valley Authority (T.V.A.), the river management project has achieved remarkable results. Water retention ponds were built on the main stream, and reservoirs were built on the tributaries to intercept the runoff from the tributaries' catchment areas to reduce the water volume of the main stream during floods. By 1944, all projects on the main and tributary streams had been completed. Because the Tennessee River is very shallow, with some parts only one foot deep, low-grade goods along the coast cannot be utilized due to high transportation costs, resulting in significant economic losses. Therefore, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers proposed a plan to channelize the river, open a nine-foot navigable waterway, and build seven high dams or thirty-two low dams. Over the past ten years, a total of thirty-one dams have been completed, one transferred from the U.S. Army and four purchased from private owners! Sixteen were self-built. Regarding the water level and water quality control of the Tennessee River, "rainfall stations" and "channel water gauge stations" have been set up along the river to record rainfall and water flow, and report increases in storage at any time. Regarding navigation in the Tennessee River Valley, over the past ten years, 9,000 miles of navigable coastline have been developed, which is equal to the combined length of the navigable coastlines of the Pacific, Atlantic, and Gulf of Mexico. In 1933, the Tennessee River's navigation volume was only 32,658,951 ton-miles. By 1942, it had increased to 161,469,344 ton-miles. It is estimated that freight traffic will increase to 1 billion ton-miles by 1960.</p>
<p>The above is only a brief overview of the future achievements of the Yangtze River Dam project in terms of hydropower generation, agricultural transformation, and transportation and navigation. The entire plan cannot be described in a short article.</p>
<p>Moreover, if the Yangtze River Dam project can be successfully completed in the future, the commercial prosperity of the Yangtze River basin will inevitably be spurred by industrial development, agricultural revitalization, and smooth transportation. This can be compared to the glorious achievements of the Tennessee River Valley in the United States. Furthermore, the scenery of the Three Gorges of the Yangtze River is exquisitely beautiful and grand, and will surely become a tourist destination for Chinese and foreign visitors in the future, just like Switzerland's substantial annual international income. Let us also look at the Tennessee River Valley, where rice paddies and factories are intertwined, and swimming, boating, fishing, and escaping the summer heat are possible. The scenery is beautiful, transforming a desolate area into a land of paradise. The Yangtze River basin will surely be like this in the future.</p>
<p>In short, Y.V.A. is not a bizarre dream, but a concrete construction plan by Dr. Savage to help China build the country. We believe that:</p>
<p>(1) The implementation of this Y.V.A. construction plan can solve the most important problem facing China today, namely the reduction of the military after demobilization. The millions of soldiers to be discharged will have a way out with "full employment." "Employing soldiers in construction" is especially a bright path towards the modernization, scientification, and mechanization of national defense, and is also a splendid shortcut for China to move from an agricultural country to an industrial country.</p>
<p>(2) The implementation of this plan does not have the problem of funding difficulties at present. Because our friendly country, the United States, is as interested in investing in Y.V.A. as it is in T.V.A. in the United States. After Dr. Savage designed the Y.V.A. plan for us and returned to the United States the year before last, he published an article titled "China's Kilowatts of Light," emphasizing the importance of the Three Gorges Dam project on the Yangtze River. He urged the American people to pay attention with the warning that it "may affect world history." He further stated in several aspects: "(1) In terms of employment, if the Yangtze River Dam project is built quickly, the American electrical and mechanical industries will be busy day and night for the next 24 years; (2) In terms of investment, it will become the most beneficial example of American foreign investment; (3) In terms of diplomacy, the friendship between China and the United States, the two major powers in the East and West, will be increasingly strengthened because of the deeply rooted interests in China," hoping for American investment. In addition, Eugene Staley, an economic advisor to the International Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, in his recent book "World Economic Development," discussed in detail the relationship between the existing savings in the United States and the future foreign investment and the construction of the Yangtze River Dam. The conclusion also stated: "Therefore, if the construction of the Yangtze River Dam is of interest to the American government and public, it would probably not be difficult to extract $100 million from its huge investment."</p>
<p>(3) The implementation of this plan also does not have the problem of "equipment" difficulties at present. Because our friendly country, the United States, is looking for suitable ways to dispose of its surplus materials, equipment, and machinery after the war. We can see the deep relationship between the surplus materials and equipment of the United States and the construction of the Yangtze River Dam project from the "U.S. Post-War Economic Policy" and the "Surplus Asset Disposal Act." Mr. Gu Chunfan once explained: "According to the "Business Week" of June 19, 1943, the factory machinery and equipment are valued at 16.6 billion U.S. dollars, which is a small supplement to the Yangtze River Dam project and the enterprises that are generated by the heat, light, power, and irrigation generated by the dam. If the U.S. authorities can consider this point, then the post-war distress of U.S. dollars and the stagnation of surplus materials can be largely and reasonably resolved."</p>
<p>(4) The implementation of this plan also does not have the problem of "technical" difficulties at present. Because our friendly country, the United States, has provided us with significant assistance in technology before, during, and after the war. During the war, with the permission of the U.S. government, our government sent several technical personnel to the United States for internships and research. The U.S. F.E.A. (Foreign Economic Administration) also directly helped us economically to send technical personnel to the United States for research. Only when the Yangtze River Dam project begins construction can Chinese engineering and technical personnel be fully mobilized, and American technical experts, engineering experts, water conservancy experts, and scientific experts will also be happy to assist us in this great human project that "affects world history."</p>
<p>On the road to nation-building after victory, unfortunately, on this day when Changchun and its surrounding areas are engulfed in the flames of war, we welcome and bid farewell to the old Dr. Savage, who is creating blessings for the 450 million people of China. We, the entire nation, are extremely ashamed and grateful.</p>
<p>What we are ashamed of... our nation is too weak, the country is too backward, and the society is too depressed! Today's world is embarking on a new road of "peace," but there are still people who deliberately create internal strife! Today's world is seeking "the happiness, prosperity, and survival of all mankind, but some of us are actually "massacring civilians" in some areas! In today's world, "nation above all else" and "construction first," but we still put party interests above all else and territorial control first! This is truly the greatest shame of the Chinese nation! We can only feel ashamed in front of this old Dr. Savage! Our people must cherish the future of nation-building and must demand stability first and construction first!</p>
<p>What we are grateful for: The old Dr. Savage, at the age of 68, has been working tirelessly and planning day and night to bring our backward country onto the broad road of modernization, scientification, industrialization, and electrification. He wants to dedicate his later years to fighting for the survival and happiness of the Chinese nation! We can only feel grateful in front of the old Dr. Savage. While welcoming and bidding farewell, we must demand that the CCP put down their butcher knives quickly, let the government lead the people, and everyone build the Y.V.A. with their strength and sweat!</p>
<p>Alas! Political countercurrents and turbulent political situations; endless party disputes have ignited a firestorm! How many people can be as loyal to the country as our friend, the old Dr. Savage? We can only feel extremely ashamed and grateful to Dr. Savage, the god of water conservancy and the saint of construction!</p>

<h3 id="e22">Three Party Leaders in Japan Negotiate; Difficult to Determine New Prime Minister; Socialist Party's Position Crucial; Emperor Hirohito of Japan Cancels Visit to MacArthur <a href="#e22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Tokyo by this Newspaper's Correspondent on the 23rd] After the resignation of the Shidehara Cabinet, there has been much speculation about the selection of the next prime minister, but Yoshida and Ichiro Hatoyama are the most frequently mentioned. A Japanese Foreign Ministry spokesperson announced today that Shidehara and his cabinet members convened a special meeting this morning, after which they went to the Progressive Party's office. Then, in the name of the Progressive Party leader, they consulted with the leaders of the Liberal and Social Democratic parties about various issues arising from the resignation of the cabinet.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Tokyo by this Newspaper's Correspondent on the 23rd] Emperor Hirohito of Japan's scheduled visit to MacArthur this morning was temporarily canceled, causing suspicion among the general public. According to informed sources, Emperor Hirohito canceled the visit to MacArthur on the advice of Yoshida and Shidehara. Shidehara believed that the Emperor's visit to MacArthur a few hours after he resigned would inevitably lead to unfavorable speculation about the new cabinet, so it was best not to visit.</p>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 23rd] MacArthur Headquarters announced this morning: MacArthur maintains a policy of "non-interference" in the resignation of the Shidehara Cabinet and the selection of its successor, leaving it to Japan to decide. MacArthur Headquarters regards the Japanese government as an agency for implementing instructions. It is impossible for the cabinet selected by Japan to not accept MacArthur Headquarters' policies. Although political maneuvers in Japan have been extremely active so far, MacArthur has not yet publicly expressed his opinion.</p>
<p>[Kaizo Nipposha, Tokyo, 23rd] After the resignation of the Shidehara Cabinet, the future of the Japanese political situation can be decided in today's meeting of the leaders of the Progressive, Socialist, and Liberal parties. According to the current situation, it is most likely that a coalition cabinet will be formed with the Liberal Party, the largest party, as the center. Shidehara met with Liberal Party President Hatoyama at 2:00 PM today and with Socialist Party leader Katayama at 3:30 PM. The key to determining the next regime lies in whether the meeting between Hatoyama and Katayama can be successful. The success of the three-party coalition cabinet also depends on the meeting between Hatoyama and Katayama. Therefore, the Socialist Party occupies a crucial position. Hatoyama said today that in order to establish the initial stage of democracy, the order to form a cabinet should be given to the President of the Liberal Party. If he himself loses his qualification, then another person will be selected to serve as the party's president.</p>

<p>[United Press, Washington, 22nd] The Department of the Army announced today: Chief of Staff General Eisenhower will depart this week to inspect the Pacific and Far East, and will meet with General MacArthur. His itinerary will be announced later. The purpose of this trip is to personally examine the needs and various problems of the U.S. military, and it will last for one month.</p>
<h3 id="e24">Eisenhower Says U.S. Army Should Have At Least One Million <a href="#e24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>(And 23rd dispatch) Eisenhower said last night at a banquet of the Kansas State University alumni association here: The U.S. Army should have at least one million people to serve the country. The minimum number of U.S. occupation forces should also have sufficient strength to quell disturbances, otherwise it will be difficult to avoid asking for help from allied countries. The main reason why he and the Department of the Army advocate extending the conscription law is this. However, the Army authorities actually hope that all occupation forces will be filled by volunteers. No country in the world fears the strength of the United States, and neither does the Soviet Union. Soviet Marshal Zhukov once told me that the Soviet Union fears that the United States will reduce its troops too quickly, so that it will not have the strong power to stabilize the situation in Europe. All allied commanders in Europe agree with Zhukov's statement. As victors, we should occupy Germany and Japan, otherwise we cannot maintain peace. The main thing needed for the occupation is food. The American people must decide whether they will sit idly by and watch their friends, and even their enemies, starve to death? But the American people have never made this decision.</p>
<h3 id="e25">Soviet Military Strength Reaches Six Million <a href="#e25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 22nd] According to the most reliable sources that arrived here today: The Soviet Union's current military strength is estimated at six million people, and it is now planning to train 1.5 million people each year. If President Truman's national military training plan is passed by Congress, then the United States will train one million young people each year. Under the aforementioned Soviet plan, trainees can decide to train for two or five years. President Truman's proposal advocates training for one year. Of the Soviet Union's current six million people, three million are ground troops. The United States had 6,833,353 troops on January 1, and its total will be set at 2,857,800 on July 1 of this year.</p>

<p>[United Press, Milan, 23rd] Milan authorities said today: The body of Mussolini, buried in a pauper's grave in the Maggiore Cemetery, was moved away at night by persons unknown. An investigation has been launched to determine his whereabouts. Mussolini was captured and shot by guerrillas on the Swiss border last April. His body was transported to Milan, hung upside down in the square for exhibition, and then buried in the Maggiore Cemetery. His mistress, Petacci, and five followers were executed at the same time, and their bodies were buried near Mussolini's grave.</p>

<p>[Reuters, London, 23rd] Australian Prime Minister Chifley said here on the eve of the opening of the Imperial Conference: The Australian government is quite concerned about the United States' increased interest in the Pacific region. I will discuss with Prime Minister Attlee the various issues related to the Pacific. The Australian government and the New Zealand government have exchanged views on the issue of Pacific military bases and have reached a general agreement. Chifley declined to elaborate on whether his government supports placing disputed and trust territories in the Pacific under international co-management, as the government does not wish to discuss the status of any particular island separately, but only wishes to obtain a clear policy on the general issue of deploying defenses on these islands. The results of this discussion will naturally be communicated to the United States. Chifley went on to say: The Australian government is quite concerned that the United States has a greater interest in the Pacific region than before the war. What the United States is interested in is undoubtedly related to the bases in the Pacific. These bases do not only refer to bases set up by one country, but also bases jointly occupied with other countries. The main strategic issues of the Empire will be discussed at the London conference. He also said: I will travel to Japan on my way home, and will depart from London around May 6 to return home.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 23rd] Australian Prime Minister Chifley and Foreign Minister Evatt revealed here yesterday that Australia now wants to have the United States participate in the joint defense plan for the Southwest Pacific region. Evatt stated that this joint defense plan should specifically include Manus Island under Australian mandate. The United States had built a large naval and air base on the island during the war against Japan. We believe that the island has now become one of the entire issues of the Southwest Pacific defense base. This is related to New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and the United States. If the United States believes that this defensive position thousands of miles away is important, then Australia will pay more attention to the defense of the Marshall and Caroline Islands in order to establish a reciprocal arrangement. Australia is now willing to hand over the mandated territory of New Guinea, including Manus Island and the Admiralty Islands, to be taken over by the United Nations organization, but since the islands are related to Australia's defense, they should still be under Australian control. The United States occupies an important position in Pacific defense and is sufficient to guarantee its security.</p>

As for the Polish question, the Security Council does not intend to discuss it today. A subcommittee will first be appointed to review whether Franco poses a threat to world peace; discussions will resume after a decision is reached.</p>
<p>[United Press, New York, 23rd] When the Security Council reconvenes today, it is expected that there will be another round of heated debate. The Iranian question is listed as the first item on the agenda, followed by Australia's proposal that the United Nations establish a commission to investigate the internal situation of Franco's Spain. Most representatives believe that a final decision on the Iranian question cannot be reached at today's meeting. The Soviet Union demands that the Iranian question be immediately removed from the agenda. Supported by the United States, Britain, and the six other representatives of the Security Council (including China), it is firmly opposed, believing that this dispute should only be concluded after the Soviet Union has fully fulfilled its guarantee of withdrawal. Yesterday, British Member of Parliament Fott and an official observer stationed in Iran both stated: The only way to guarantee Iran's independence is to send a fact-finding mission to the country. It is widely believed that this proposal has garnered sympathy from all parties in the Security Council.</p>
<p>[United Press, Tehran, 23rd] The "Tehran Daily" declared today: Soviet troops have withdrawn from Pendar and Palavi along the Caspian Sea coast. The report further stated: Judging from various indications, the Red Army has in fact withdrawn from Iran, with the exception of Azerbaijan province.</p>

<p>Said Not to be Aimed at France</p>
<p>[United Press, New York, 26th] Spanish Army Chief of Staff Ayugieru arrived here today and denied that the so-called "Secret Plan No. 27," as alleged by the United Nations Security Council, posed a threat to France. It is said that this plan was submitted to the Security Council by the Polish representative, Lanji, to support Poland's accusations of Spanish aggression. In reality, this is a strictly defensive plan. Ayugieru stated that his trip was to Cuba for personal matters and he had no official mission in the United States.</p>

<p>[Reuters, New York, 23rd]: British Ambassador to the United States Halifax, on the eve of his departure from office, delivered a farewell speech last night, stating that the United Nations is truly the world's last and best hope. If we want to make this charter of world peace more valuable than the ink with which it was written, we must faithfully maintain the friendship and understanding between the people of all signatory nations. If so, our hopes have a chance of being realized; otherwise, nothing will be achieved. The establishment of a new organization requires considerable time, and it should be led forward by the United States and Britain, two countries that have many things in common. The friendship between our two countries has no selfish motives and is definitely not aimed at anyone. Its purpose is only to strengthen the will and work of the United Nations organization.</p>

<p>[Reuters, Washington, 22nd] When the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) submitted its sixth report to Congress yesterday, it included a message from President Truman stating, "We cannot achieve peace and prosperity when devastation, disease, and poverty make it impossible for people to survive.

<p>[United Press, New York, 23rd] Like a delayed-action bomb, Leon Trotsky's biography of Stalin has finally exploded. In a book titled "Stalin," Trotsky accuses the current Soviet leader of possibly having administered poison to Lenin to induce suicide. He also claims that Stalin actively assisted in the killing of the former Tsar and his family in Yekaterinburg. Trotsky was assassinated in Mexico City on April 20, 1940. This book is his final work, left unfinished. In 1941, one of his comrades, Mara Murmus, completed it. The book was ready for publication at the time of the Pearl Harbor attack, so it was delayed until after the end of the war.</p>

These Soviet fighter planes were part of the planes supplied to the Soviet Union by the United States under the Lend-Lease Act.

Senators Connally and Vandenberg and their wives accompanied him. Many observers believe that this trip carries a so-called "tough" policy to establish clear boundaries for the Soviet sphere of influence in Europe and the Mediterranean. The State Department does not believe that Byrnes will "carry the burden for the Soviet Union," but it is speculated that he may join the British in firmly opposing Soviet expansion.</p>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 22nd] According to French officials, news reporters will not be allowed to enter the upcoming Four-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference of the United States, Britain, France, and the Soviet Union.

<p>Jews Fantasize</p>
<p>Used for Secret Propaganda</p>
<p>[Reuters, Jerusalem, 23rd] Illegal propaganda issued by Jewish secret organizations is becoming increasingly widespread in Palestine. They are also manufacturing propaganda bombs, using iron pipes to store a small amount of explosives and throwing them into the city at night, scattering propaganda leaflets. As authorities have tightened news censorship, Jewish secret propaganda has intensified. Secret societies such as the Jewish Resistance Movement, the Jewish National Military Organization, and the Israeli Freedom Fighters' Association all have various mimeographed or lithographed propaganda materials. Authorities have explicitly announced that printing or possessing such propaganda materials is illegal. Propaganda materials falsely claiming to be issued by organizations are also frequently found in the mail. The content generally promotes radical actions to achieve the goal of large-scale Jewish immigration to Palestine.</p>

For humanitarian reasons, we cannot stand idly by and allow large numbers of men, women, and children to starve to death without help. Mona will soon go to Washington to report the results of the investigation to UNRRA Director LaGuardia.</p>

<h3 id="e47">Eight Cinemas Close Down Over Assigned Seating Issue; "Hiring More Ushers is Too Much of a Burden"; Film Industry Association Sends Representatives to Appeal to All Sectors; Emergency Meeting Scheduled for This Morning <a href="#e47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>[Our Own Dispatch] The Municipal Police Department issued an order to all cinemas in the city the day before yesterday, requiring that all tickets sold be assigned seats starting yesterday afternoon, under penalty of closure for violations. The Great Shanghai, Jindu, Paris, Jincheng, Ping'an, Huguang, Xinguang, and Dumei cinemas have been forced to temporarily close starting yesterday, as implementation in the short term is beyond their financial capacity. They have requested assistance from the Film Industry Association.</p>
<p>According to a spokesperson for the association, it is indeed very difficult for cinemas to convert tickets to assigned seating. First, with assigned seating, audiences will inevitably arrive after the show is about to start, entering the theater after the lights are dimmed, causing numerous inconveniences for ushering. At the same time, crowds inside and outside the theater will be congested, and order will inevitably be chaotic. Second, assigned seating requires increasing the number of ushers, which would drastically increase the cinema's expenses, making it unsustainable. Previously, the Asia Cinema mobilized ushers from various cinemas to serve when special dramas were shown, but this is not easily implemented for smaller cinemas.</p>
<p>The Great China, Cathay, Golden Gate, and International cinemas in the city originally had assigned seating, so there was no problem. As for the Great Light, Nanjing, and Majestic cinemas, they temporarily wrote numbers on the tickets yesterday afternoon, and audiences found their own seats.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Film Industry Association dispatched representatives such as Ren Jinzhen and others to appeal to the Municipal Government, Resident Committee of the Municipal Provisional Council, and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, explaining the difficulties and requesting assistance. The managers of the eight closed cinemas convened a meeting at the Great Shanghai Cinema at 5:00 PM yesterday and resolved several points: (1) The eight cinemas ordered to close will publish a public announcement in the newspaper and intensify their appeals to all parties. (2) Request the police department to delay implementation. The Film Industry Association is scheduled to hold an emergency meeting this morning and will also host a reception for the press at the Kangle Restaurant at 3:00 PM this afternoon, requesting them to uphold justice.</p>
<h3 id="e48">Mai Jingming, First of the Major Traitors to Face Public Trial, Sentencing at the End of the Month; Former Puppet Prison Warden Eloquent in His Defense; Trial of Wang Zuying and Others Postponed for Further Questioning <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>[Our Own Dispatch] The case of Mai Jingming, the first of the major traitors to face public trial, was prosecuted by the High Procuratorate for colluding with the enemy to disrupt finance. The trial continued yesterday. The defendant admitted to serving as a member of the Puppet Central Political Committee's Economic Special Committee, Director of the Puppet Postal Remittances Bureau, Director of the Puppet Commodity Inspection Bureau, and Director of the Puppet Insurance Supervision Bureau. However, he defended himself against the prosecutor's indictment on five points: (1) During his tenure on the Puppet Economic Committee, although there was a proposal to communicate remittances from overseas Chinese, it was not implemented, so the accusation of absorbing funds from overseas Chinese is inappropriate. (2) During his tenure as Director of the Puppet Postal Remittances Bureau, he did not engage in speculative activities. (3) The prosecutor alleges collusion with the enemy, but he did not have contact with the enemy. (4) During his tenure as Director of the Puppet Insurance Supervision Bureau, the sale of stamps was actually received and issued by the Puppet Ministry of Industry and Commerce, without any personal enrichment. (5) He surrendered himself to the Military Statistics Bureau on September 30 of last year and should be granted a reduced sentence according to regulations. The defendant did not request a lawyer to defend him, and no family members attended the hearing yesterday. The court appointed a lawyer to provide free legal defense, but the defense concluded with only a few words, and the sentencing was scheduled for the afternoon of the 30th. In addition, the case of Liang Mingwang, a puppet police chief, and Yao Zhiman, a police officer, who were convicted of bribery and dereliction of duty by the puppet court at the time, is currently being executed. After a new investigation by the High Procuratorate, they were prosecuted for treason. The debate in this case also concluded yesterday, and the sentencing was scheduled for the 30th.</p>
<p>In addition, Chen Weifan reported that Shen Guanjing, the puppet Shanghai Prison Warden, transferred 850 prisoners to Sizhao Mountain and other places in the Zhoushan Islands to help the enemy construct defensive fortifications, of whom sixty to seventy died due to unbearable torture, and some of the survivors were also disabled. In addition, he colluded with Xu Quanyuan, the head of the prison's work section, to steal and sell large quantities of paper, white cloth, scrap iron, purple copper, gray felt, and other items stored in the prison. After the case was accepted by the High Court, it was heard once, and during the retrial yesterday, the audience was filled with prison officials, guards, and bailiffs. The defendant spoke eloquently, resorting to all kinds of cunning arguments. The court believed that the case still needed investigation and ordered the retrial to be postponed.</p>
<p>Wang Zuying, a puppet Zhenhai County Police Bureau detective; Kang Zhuang, a puppet Shanghai County Sanlintang Inspection Post Director; Li Wenhan, a puppet Customs Police officer; Wang Deqing, a puppet Huazhong Railway laborer; Zhang Shaobo, a puppet Dongtai County Gendarmerie intelligence chief; Liu Huiqi, a puppet Shanghai Zhaoying Road Gendarmerie assistant; Sheng Dian, a puppet Nanhui County Government inspector; Dong Xuelin, a puppet Nanhui County Datuan Town Police Station Nicheng Outpost patrolman; and Wei Wenshou, a puppet Nanhui County Government clerk, were accused of abusing their power during the puppet regime to bully and harm the people. The complainants and victims testified to the details, but all defendants firmly denied the charges. The court ordered the retrial to be postponed.</p>

<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] A cluster of over a thousand thatched shacks lined the area around Yaoqiao Creek on Yuyao Road. The residents were mostly rickshaw pullers and other laborers, while the women and children largely worked in factories. Yesterday, at 1:30 PM, a fire broke out in one of the shacks when embers from a midday cooking fire were left unattended near the stove. The blaze quickly spread among the closely packed thatched structures, becoming uncontrollable. During the height of the fire, an elderly woman named Zhao (65 years old, from Jiangbei), unable to escape, was burned to death on the spot. Another man fell and died. The fire department arrived and extinguished the blaze by 3:30 PM. Over 300 thatched shacks were destroyed, leaving approximately 2,000 to 3,000 residents homeless.

<p>Invites Mayor and American and Chinese Senior Officials to Participate</p>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Admiral Lord Fraser, a renowned British naval commander with 43 years of service in the Royal Navy and currently Commander-in-Chief of the British Pacific Fleet, hosted Chinese and foreign journalists at 10:30 AM yesterday in the wardroom of the British warship HMS "Whimbrel." At 11:00 AM, he also hosted Liu Hongsheng, Wang Xiaolai, Yan Huiqing, and others for a tour.</p>
<p>Admiral Fraser stated briefly: He has been in China for six months and is visiting Shanghai for the first time. He is deeply grateful for the warm reception he has received from all sides. He is very pleased with the assistance and cooperation the British fleet has received from the United States and China. At the request of the Chinese government, the British Navy has assisted in mine-clearing operations in North China and the Pearl River, including locations such as Shantou and Xiamen. Currently, the number of ships in China includes four cruisers, eight destroyers, twelve escort vessels, two light transport ships, and several submarines. The fleet's strength is approximately the same as during the war because its duties remain quite heavy, such as protecting Sino-British merchant vessels and guarding ports. Hong Kong will continue to be a British naval base. Admiral Fraser praised the Chinese naval personnel trained in England, calling them exceptionally talented. The UK is transferring a cruiser to the trained Chinese navy, which will arrive in China soon. Other ships will be received after training is completed, as receiving a ship is not an easy task. Chinese naval personnel have been receiving training in England for forty years. After his remarks, Admiral Fraser invited several senior officials to accompany the journalists on a tour of the ship and another similar vessel, HMS "Newfoundland." HMS "Whimbrel" is scheduled to leave Shanghai this Friday and will be replaced by HMS "Newfoundland."</p>
<p>At 5:30 PM yesterday, Admiral Fraser inspected the British naval forces stationed in Shanghai and the flag-lowering ceremony at the British Consulate to commemorate St. George's Day. He specifically invited Mayor Qian, Deputy Mayor He, Secretary-General Shen, and senior American and Chinese military and political officials to participate. Several hundred British residents and Chinese and foreign dignitaries attended. Mayor Qian, dressed in military uniform, was present, and the British honor guard played music several times, making the ceremony very solemn and dignified. After the flag-lowering ceremony, Admiral Fraser hosted a cocktail party and dinner reception, fostering a very harmonious atmosphere.</p>

<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The Chinese Tea Association hosted a banquet at the Jinmen Hotel last night at 7:00 PM to welcome Colonel Harrison, the representative of US President Truman. Shou Jingwei served as chairman. Ms. Smith, the representative of the US-China Commercial Association in China, the tea tycoon Tang Jisan, and Pan Gongzhan, among others, attended. During the banquet, Mr. Shou gave a welcome speech, and Colonel Harrison delivered a reply, stating that Americans have loved Chinese tea for many years. The decline in Chinese tea exports during the war was a great loss for Americans. He hopes that China can continue to supply a large quantity of tea to the United States after the war. Ms. Smith stated that the Chinese tea market has been taken over by Britain, India, and Japan in recent years, mainly because Chinese tea prices are higher than those of other countries. However, Americans have always loved Chinese tea, so she hopes that future Chinese tea export prices can be lowered to regain the market. Mr. Pan Gongzhan expressed: (1) He hopes that exported tea can become standardized. (2) The reasons for the high tea prices are nothing more than high costs, increased interest rates, and deliberate price increases by some speculative merchants. Therefore, he hopes that legitimate merchants can do their best to stop this quickly to develop China's trade.</p>

<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Hu Dudian, also known as Hu Tian, a pirate who once ran rampant in the eastern Zhejiang waters, was recruited by Commissioner Du Wei of the Zhejiang Provincial Government to serve as the captain of a convoy team and renamed Jin Hongfei. However, Hu's nature was difficult to change, and he secretly led his gang to engage in looting in the Fenweishan waters. On December 16th of last year, Hu himself took his own sailing ship to Shanghai, arriving in Wusong and going ashore for a short break. He happened to meet the victim, He Beixi. Two years prior, on October 10th, He and his cousin had rented a sailing ship from Wenzhou to transport a large quantity of longan and white sugar to Shanghai. When they arrived at Fenwei waters, they encountered over twenty pirates who robbed them. At the same time, his cousin, He Shan, was shot and killed. He himself was imprisoned in the cabin and then continued to Kanmen before being released ashore. Before leaving, the bandit leader gave him a business card with the name Jin Hongfei, also known as Hu Tian, ​​and instructed him to bring 20,000 yuan to redeem the ship. After He asked someone to mediate, he handed 4,000 yuan to Hu's bandits to redeem the ship. Two years later, they met unexpectedly, so he reported to the 88th Division Headquarters, which sent troops to arrest Hu and found seven rifles, two wooden Mausers, two pistols, 1,273 rounds of ammunition, and 1.05 million yuan in legal tender on his ship. After being sent to the Military Law Office of the Songhu Garrison Headquarters for trial, he was found guilty under Article 2, Paragraph 1, Clause 3 of the Punishment of Bandits Act and Article 302, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law, and sentenced to death. The execution was approved by the Xuzhou Pacification Headquarters and carried out by firing squad at 3:00 PM yesterday. Hu was 28 years old and from Fenweishan, Zhejiang.</p>

<p>[Report from the United Press International Local News] According to US Navy sources, a major massacre occurred at 3:00 AM yesterday on a US Navy landing ship anchored in the Yangtze River. According to reports, a second-class seaman named Smith, 19 years old, had just left the United States on February 2nd of this year. Last night at 10:00 PM, he was guarding the gangplank on the ship, conveying orders, and went off duty at midnight, sleeping alone. Before long, a mental illness suddenly broke out, and he sneaked into the officers quarters, stole a submachine gun, and carried a pistol he had brought with him, barging into the seamen's dormitory and suddenly firing at thirty seamen who were asleep, firing as many as twenty rounds. When the ammunition ran out, he took out a sharp blade and stabbed wildly before stabbing himself in the abdomen. Seven seamen were killed instantly, and two were seriously injured. The injured men struggled to wrest the blade from him, and another seaman knocked Smith down. Smith had three severe knife wounds to his upper abdomen, and it is not yet known if he will survive. He and the other injured seamen have been transported to the Shanghai Naval Hospital by Navy plane for treatment. Rear Admiral Rogers, Commander of the US Seventh Fleet Amphibious Forces, received the report and personally flew to the landing ship where the incident occurred to inspect the scene and ordered a court of inquiry to be established.</p>

<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Cao Weide, a native of Changzhou, runs the Cao Deji Umbrella Handle Factory at No. 28, TianTong Road Tai An Li. The business is very good, which has aroused the covetousness of bandits. At 6:00 PM on the 18th, the factory suddenly received a threatening letter from bandits, using the name "Shanghai Special Branch of the Democratic Party," requesting a temporary loan of 500,000 yuan in legal tender. They instructed that the money be placed in a five-pound Zaikang biscuit tin, with biscuits on top, and left in the house. They would send someone to pick it up in front of everyone tomorrow evening. Cao reported the information to the North Station Sub-bureau, and Chief Li Jiachu of the Criminal Section sent police to wait. As a result, no one came that day. Two or three days later, another letter was received, agreeing to send someone to pick it up between 7:00 and 8:00 PM on the 22nd. The police station sent detectives Jiang Jinrong, Sergeant He DeKui, and other plainclothes officers to lie in ambush. Wu Afu was arrested, and Chiang Heting, an accomplice, was later arrested at the Detai Xing Inn on Zhejiang Road. They confessed to extortion, and were sent to the District Procuratorate for investigation yesterday.</p>

<p>— Our Newspaper's 17th Dispatch from the Air, Special Correspondent Liang Xiaozhong</p>
<p>Nanning Becomes a Kingdom of Merchants</p>
<p>During the Qingming Festival, amidst repeated winds and rains, the depressing days become even more so, and the bustling city becomes more lively day by day. Due to the rapid bankruptcy of rural areas, funds are quickly flowing into the safes of city merchants, and Nanning is no exception. This fortunate city is heading towards a distorted prosperity day by day. Nanning is moving towards prosperity, but crime follows behind it. Merchants dominate everything.</p>
<p>This subtropical small city is not unlovable. After a fresh rain, the brightly green trees lining the streets drip with rainwater. Under the trees are piled high with bananas, loquats, plums, longans, honey pomelos... The small merchants call out in high-pitched voices: "Come on, come on, come get fresh fruit!" It really has a unique flavor. Looking up, the ancient city walls are shrouded in a thin layer of light mist, and the majestic Kunlun Mountains are faintly submerged in the distant clouds. The West River meanders around the ancient city, flowing quietly and slowly. Two or three boatmen, holding pipes, squat on the bows of their boats, chatting idly in the Nanning dialect – Pinghua. Everything is so peaceful, and 80,000 people pass their days there lightly, the busiest only with "business."</p>
<p>Every night, strolling past the rows of brokerage firms along the riverbank, the strong smell of anise oil, star anise, and tung oil stimulates the nerves, and the sound of pouring French silver coins, double eagles, Yuan heads, and copper coins vibrates the eardrums. Merchants, dressed in black silk and holding umbrellas, rush in and out, and money and goods are exchanged on these streets all day long. At daybreak, large numbers of cars set off in different directions, driving to Hanoi and Wuzhou. Those driving to Hanoi smuggled goods through customs and returned with large quantities of foreign goods, like French silver coins. Those driving to Wuzhou carried anise oil and star anise, preparing to wait for ships to go downriver to Guangzhou and Hong Kong. The gold business went to Liuzhou, taking Central Aviation planes to fly to Chongqing, Shanghai and other places. The routes are clear and orderly, so the boss's pockets become more and more "mak-mak" (full) day by day.</p>
<p>Although Nanning also has a large river, we have already told you, "It is a quiet West River." It has probably been two months since the sound of steamboat whistles has been heard. Where did the boats go? They were all requisitioned for frequent military transport, and they went east and never returned. Merchants lost a major route for transporting goods, so they had to rely on cars. As a result, transportation companies sprang up like mushrooms after rain. The small city has nearly fifty transportation companies. Whether it's commercial or military vehicles, they won't miss the opportunity, and everyone shares the profits and gets rich.</p>
<p>Drunken Skirts and Tired Red Silks</p>
<p>Precisely because Nanning is purely a kingdom of merchants, even though Nanning is surrounded by shadows of hunger, this small city of two and a half li wide has never lost a bit of its revelry of singing songs and drinking wine, its paper-drunk gold-obsessed atmosphere, everywhere showing a "scene of prosperity." Strolling through the streets every night, there is a restaurant every five steps and a tavern every ten steps. The sounds of yelling and shouting, as well as the cloying, sharp calls and annoying singing of the "goddesses," mix into an evil atmosphere, covering up the misery of the world! Merchants have money and gold bars, so naturally they will enjoy themselves to the fullest. The "Special Areas" (Guangxi's brothels are all euphemistically called "Special Areas," abbreviated as "Special Zones") under the South River are like New Year's Eve every night and Cold Food Festival every morning. Drunken skirts and tired red silks are the unique enjoyment of experts from all walks of life. The "scandal" of a tycoon using a quantity of gold equivalent to the weight of a prostitute to redeem her spread throughout the city. The "romance" of a young gold shop owner buying the heart of a female student with gold has also become excellent conversation material. The word "money" dominates the life of Nanning.</p>
<p>People whose hearts are filled with material desires will not be too disappointed when they come to this small city. Here, there are cinemas, dance halls, and secret "back-rubbing" bathhouses. The smiling dimples and willow-leaf eyebrows of the waitresses in the hotels bewitch your heart, and the frightening number of wandering orioles and swallows in the hotels will make you forget your home and long to stay. There is everything, as long as you have money. It is truly a case of instant obedience to your wishes. When this reporter first arrived in Nanning and stayed in a hotel, a porter even pushed open the door and asked, "Want to play with some wild game?" Pimps for wild chickens. It is said that their rule is that after getting the money, the wild chicken gets 60% and the porter gets 40%.</p>
<p>Another very interesting thing is that Guangxi is a province with the strictest ban on gambling, but in the streets and alleys of Nanning, the sounds of mahjong and pai gow can be heard everywhere. Large gambling dens are controlled by some "powerful groups" and cannot be touched by the government. This is truly the Monte Carlo of the South. Those with a weakness for herding pigs, why not come!</p>
<p>Eating Grass, Squeezing Milk, Abortion Leading to Death</p>
<p>On one hand, there is lewdness and shamelessness; on the other hand, there is serious work. China's civil servants and those who teach are doomed to a life of misery. The scene is bleak everywhere. It really makes one shed tears of sympathy for the teachers who "eat grass and squeeze milk"! There are five private middle schools and one provincial middle school here (recently divided into junior and senior high schools), and two normal schools. The highest salary for teachers in private middle schools is no more than 30,000 yuan. The salary in public middle schools is better, but it is no more than 50,000 yuan or so. Single men can barely manage, but those with families simply complain endlessly. Recently, in the provincial No. 1 Joint Middle School, a female teacher named Lin, who was five months pregnant, really couldn't afford to raise the sixth little life with a salary of 50,000 yuan (she already had five children), so she went to a doctor for an abortion. As a result, both mother and child died tragically, leaving the oldest child only eight years old and the youngest only one year old, calling for their mother in a very miserable situation. As for elementary school teachers, it is even more like bitter gourd stewed with bear bile, bitterness upon bitterness. The nominal salary is 3,000 yuan per month, plus 100 jin of rice, but from January to now, they have not received a single penny or a single grain of rice. Male teachers are forced to set up stalls on the street after class, and female teachers make a living by doing needlework for others. Their plight would make Confucius, if he were resurrected, deeply sigh, "I want to say nothing!" Nanning is the richest county in Guangxi, yet it is like this. The situation in other remote border areas is even more unspeakable.</p>
<p>Students Suffer, Preferring to Go to Jail</p>
<p>Teachers suffer, and students also suffer. The tuition and fees of more than 40,000 yuan per semester charged by private schools go without saying, but public schools are not necessarily a better deal. Tuition is less, but there are many miscellaneous taxes, such as compensation fees, bench fees, bed frame fees... nothing is free, and every fee is expensive. A single charge is 20,000 or 30,000 yuan. The principal then takes this money and gives it to his brother-in-law for general affairs and his godson for cashiering, to operate and operate again, making a big business. They don't care if the students have no dorms to live in, no water to use, or no teachers. It's a complete mess, smoky and chaotic. What kind of school is that? Rice is as precious as cassia (now rice in Nanning only sells for 20,000 yuan, which is considered the cheapest in the province). Sending a child to school costs at least more than 100,000 yuan per semester, which very few parents can afford. As a result, students are constantly dropping out of school. It is common for half of the students to drop out from the beginning of the semester to the end. Normal school students are nominally on government scholarships, but they can only get 3,000 to 4,000 yuan a month. A normal school student said to the reporter with a bitter face, "With this kind of treatment, I would rather go to jail!" The reporter asked him why. He smiled and said, "Because prisoners still have 20 liang of rice rations every day, which is much better than us." Every evening, you can see students, dressed in rags, selling stationery and books at used clothing stalls along Pingdeng Street. Otherwise, how can they afford 15,000 yuan a month for food? There are also many, many poor students, which is a characteristic of Nanning. In fact, it can be said to be a common phenomenon in Guangxi.</p>
<p>The Provincial Government Moving to Nanning is Expected to Materialize</p>
<p>This small city is democratic enough. Newspapers and magazines of all kinds, both pure and mixed, can be seen and bought here. Quite a few pure young people have also begun to be poisoned, dropping their books and pens, rushing to meetings, and brewing up trends. Some time ago, a small group of people with unclear intentions caused panic in this mountain city, but now everything is calm. There are three newspapers in the city: one Central Daily News, one Guangxi Daily News, and one business newspaper run by merchants. Each is a large broadsheet and has its own readers. There are very few bookstores, because most of the bookstores can only be called book stalls, selling goods from 1938 and 1939. Shanghai newspapers arrive once a week, which is indeed very popular.</p>
<p>Recently, Nanning is demolishing the city on a large scale and rebuilding the ring road. Speaking of roads, one thinks of Nanning's municipal administration. Nanning's municipal administration is "roads are uneven, electric lights are not bright, and telephone service is unreliable."</p>
<p>There is talk of the provincial government moving from Guilin to Nanning. If it becomes a reality, the mercantile atmosphere of Nanning will probably be diluted by the political atmosphere.</p>

<p>Nantong County, located north of the Yangtze River, renowned for its abundant products, honest and simple people, and touted as a model county, since the trumpet of victory resounded and the enemy dragged its miserable shadow away, people began to long for a return to their former peaceful and prosperous lives. However, these beautiful dreams were ultimately shattered by the incessant harassment of the New Fourth Army, leaving the people of Nantong with only a city framework. But the bells of peace have rung, and the Executive Headquarters has finally been established.</p>
<p>The Executive Headquarters arrived on the evening of March 18th, stayed for two weeks, and left Nantong for Rugao on the 31st. Then, some returned to Nantong, some went back to Rugao, and some went to Shanghai. As of now, the government team led by Team Leader Xiao is still in Nantong, while Deng Ke has gone to Huaiyin. The Communist Party representatives are in Rugao. For nearly a month, the two sides have been negotiating without agreement, meeting without discussing, almost reaching a stalemate. Nantong is calm, but the so-called "Nantong Massacre," as reported in the Shanghai newspapers, has left a whirlpool on the quiet lake surface!</p>
<p>Where exactly is the "massacre" "massacred"? Let the reporter first record some facts.</p>
<p>The Agitated Procession</p>
<p>The news of the Executive Headquarters' arrival in Nantong was brought to the city's residents on March 17th. On the morning of the 18th, from citizens to students to civil servants, everyone was busy gathering at the Haier Lane in the West Gate, anticipating the arrival of the Headquarters. Thirty-odd young people were already there, holding the banner of the "Literary and Art Association," shouting "Oppose government-run people's organizations!" when they saw people's groups passing by. When student groups passed by, they shouted, "Students, break free from your cages!" "Those with blood and spirit, come over here!" When crowds of tens of thousands of people passed by, they shouted, "Abolish the Baojia system!" "Oppose household registration checks!" "Oppose one-party rule!" Unfortunately, it rained, and because the Headquarters could no longer possibly arrive before noon, most of the welcoming people could only temporarily suppress their enthusiasm, regroup, and go back to rest, waiting to come again in the afternoon. But a section of the procession began to agitate. Whoever left was "lagging behind," and they were scolded, ridiculed, and roared at. They resisted the cold wind, cold rain, and hunger, shouting and waiting for freedom and light. Young people are easily impulsive, and the psychology of the crowd is blind. Thus, local agitation triggered the entire procession. The leading teachers could no longer make the students obey the rules, because they said, "Today is already a day of democracy!" Democracy meant that teachers could no longer control students, so the teachers left, "liberating" the students, and the students became the "democratic" camp. Thus, amidst the wind and rain, they sang songs and shouted slogans. This continued until 6 p.m., when they finally followed the jeep tracks of the Executive Headquarters and returned. Their basic team consisted of thirty-odd people, plus the so-called "bloody spirited" ones, totaling sixty or seventy people.</p>
<p>The mission of the Executive Headquarters was to mediate military affairs between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party. Things like "Oppose one-party rule!" "Schools are prisons!" "Oppose secret agent teachers! Secret agent students!" "Abolish the Baojia system!" "To recover the Northeast, first recover Hong Kong!" were unacceptable. At the same time, because it was late, the representatives of the Headquarters should have been having dinner and resting, so after arriving at the guesthouse, Yang, the staff officer representing the government team, went outside and repeatedly and tactfully suggested talking about it again tomorrow. But the mood of the crowd was so extreme that they would not stop until they achieved their goals. Thus, a large crowd blindly rushed to the location of the guesthouse - "Taohua Pavilion" - hoping to meet with the American representative Deng Ke. Deng Ke refused to meet, but after their repeated requests, Deng Ke finally appeared. He also promised the students a tea party the next day (March 19th, 2 p.m.). However, Deng Ke was quite tired, and was followed by a banquet for all sectors of Nantong society. Because of the enthusiasm of the Nantong people beyond all else, the American, Kuomintang, and Communist representatives all enjoyed themselves in the lively music, toasting each other, and drinking heartily, so that all three representatives were somewhat drunk. In addition, Deng Ke had been traveling and rushing around for days, and he caught a slight illness, which ultimately delayed the tea party the next afternoon. At that tea party, Deng Ke did not arrive, but Wu Qing and Fan Fayuan, reporters from the Communist Party's Xinhua News Agency who came with the Headquarters, served as temporary reporters. The students did not raise their hopes, and the two reporters did not have the ability to answer the students' requests. Thus, a disturbance passed.</p>
<p>Sun Pingtian's Disappearance</p>
<p>The matter is like this, but everyone admits that the ending here is terrifying, and it also sows the seeds of the so-called "massacre." On the 25th, a young man named Sun Pingtian disappeared. At the same time, on April 4th, Sun Pingtian's body was found in the river off the coast of Tiansheng Port. This is a mystery, a painful mystery! Sun Pingtian was a young man who had been dismissed for a long time and had served as a reporter for a puppet newspaper. However, he always used the guise of a reporter to participate in various activities. But why did he disappear? Why did he float on the river? According to rumors here, some say it was because Sun Rixin and two others disappeared on the way home on the evening of the 22nd. Since Sun and others were all friends of Sun Pingtian, it was to incite outrage and make them leave. Some say they went to the New Fourth Army area together, but Sun Pingtian was not a communist, and the New Fourth Army falsely accused him of being a troublemaker, subjected him to cruel torture, and tied a huge stone to him and threw him into the river to try to eliminate the traces. Who knew that the spring rains flooded, the river suddenly rose, and the water rushed down, so that it floated to the surface in the river off the coast of Tiansheng Port (Note: Tiansheng Port is upstream, where the New Fourth Army is stationed.) Some say it was a personal feud, taking this opportunity to retaliate, hoping to divert attention. Another said it was a crime of passion involving romance. In short, there are many different opinions. Who exactly did Sun Pingtian die at the hands of? Only heaven knows.</p>
<p>Investigation of the Facts</p>
<p>Here, the reporter made a special trip to interview several responsible parties, soliciting their words about the disappearance of the young people: The first was Luo Yuheng, the principal of Nantong Women's Normal School. Ms. Luo has been in education for nearly thirty years, and has been in charge of the Women's Normal School for nearly twenty years. She said: "I saw in the Shanghai newspapers that two students from the Women's Normal School had been arrested. According to a detailed investigation, there is really no such thing. As for those who asked for leave, there are three or four, but most of them were asked for leave by their parents. Now the students are in class, very quiet, there is no chaotic phenomenon." Regarding the student representatives of the Women's Normal School in Shanghai, Principal Luo said: "I don't know, but this is probably always organized afterwards."</p>
<p>The second is the Provincial Nantong Middle School. Principal Gu went to Zhenjiang to discuss school affairs and did not return. Huang Yingshao, the director of teaching affairs, received the interview. According to him: "The newspaper reported that more than twenty students from our school were arrested. I can't say that. None of the boarding students are missing. Among more than 1,000 students, there are more than ten students who asked for leave, which is naturally not surprising. As for where they went after they asked for leave, the school does not know. However, one of our colleagues, Mr. Qian Sufan, was arrested in the school. The people who made the arrest said, 'We are the Communist Party' when they left. Where did he go? Who arrested him? It's really a mystery!"</p>
<p>Team Leader Ye's Indignation</p>
<p>Xiao, the team leader of the Executive Headquarters government team, returned to Nantong from Shanghai on the 14th. He said: "When I was in Shanghai, I saw news in the Shanghai newspapers about the Nantong massacre. At that time, Chief He also asked me what exactly was going on? I said: There is no massacre or anything at all. At the same time, this news also blames the official for Deng Ke's failure to meet with student representatives. It can also be said that especially me, I have to state that I have no right to interfere with whether Deng Ke meets or not. As for drinking too much, this is something that often happens when people are excited. How can you emphasize that the official got him drunk? The wording is aggressive, and it's too unreasonable!" As he spoke, he was very angry.</p>
<p>Division Commander Liu, Commissioner Xu, County Magistrate Yang, and District Chief Zhang all said this: "We cannot allow the error to exist in the hearts of countless people who do not understand the truth. We must let everyone understand the facts."</p>
<p>Sun Tingchang's Words</p>
<p>Here is another ending, which is a statement published in the "Southeast Daily" in Nantong on April 16th, transcribed as follows: "Sun Tingchang respectfully informs Sun Jingfu and the friends of his young son Pingtian. Regarding the matter of my young son Pingtian, we, the foolish couple, in the spirit of love of our Lord Jesus, have already declared that we do not want to pursue it. Now I hear that in the Shanghai Dagong Daily on the 10th, someone named Sun Jingfu submitted an article in my tone, which is very surprising! I hereby solemnly declare: I hope that Pingtian's friends will no longer take any action in the tone of my foolish couple, so as to avoid external misunderstandings. This announcement." Then, who is the person on the "Dagong Daily" who claims to be Pingtian's father? It's really a mystery! (18th)</p>
<p>Appeals from Various Organizations</p>
<p>According to express mail sent by various Nantong agencies and organizations on the 17th, it is mentioned in great detail about the disappearance of Sun Pingtian, especially recorded as follows: (The signed agencies and organizations are the Headquarters of the 105th Division of the Army, the Fourth District Commissioner's Office of Jiangsu Province, the Nantong County Party Headquarters of the Chinese Kuomintang, the Nantong Branch of the Three Principles of the People Youth League, the Nantong County Government, the Nantong County Local Court, the Jiangsu Provincial Nantong Public Education Museum, the Nantong County Public Education Museum, the Nantong County Chamber of Commerce, the Nantong County Farmers' Association, the Nantong County Federation of Trade Unions, the Nantong County Education Association, the Nantong County Journalists Association, the Nantong Lawyers Association, the Nantong County People's Freedom Guarantee Committee, and the Nantong County Physicians Association.</p>
<p>Sun Pingtian was a reporter for the puppet Central News Agency and the puppet Jiangbei Daily. For several years, under the wing of the enemy, he advocated peace, and was despised by people. After the puppet organization disintegrated, he lost his job and was reduced from a cultural traitor to a local rogue. He was recently assassinated for unknown reasons, but the government, in order to maintain law and order, has already conducted an autopsy and is investigating the murderer. His father, Sun Tingchang, has two sons and two daughters. According to his written statement, he has never been to Shanghai to appeal for his son. The Communist Party is imagining things, using the pseudonym Sun Jingfu, posing as Sun Pingtian's father, and publishing statements to various newspapers, and falsely claiming that Sun Pingtian is a reporter for the New Nantong Daily, in order to place the responsibility for the murder of a journalist on our side, arousing the resonance of cultural figures. The sinister intention is chilling!</p>
<p>After Sun Pingtian was killed, the merchants and people were not disturbed, but the newspaper claimed that a terrifying situation had been formed. The Communist Party is making alarming statements and has other hopes. We respectfully hope that the Shanghai news masters will come to Nantong to inspect as soon as possible to clarify the truth.</p>
<p>The news released by the Communist Party in Shanghai is not even a word or a sentence close to the facts. Sima Zhao's intentions are known to everyone. I hope that the loyal and virtuous people in the cultural and news circles will not be misled by deceptive words. Please see that after the victory, the Communist Party in various places has destroyed transportation and hindered the receipt of surrender. Recently, it has intensified its efforts, cleverly establishing various bloody struggle names, massacring compatriots, and it is difficult to count. Unfortunately, the people in the Communist areas who have suffered their misfortune have recognized their faces, and the urban compatriots who have been deceived by them are still vying to admire them. Social leaders should each base themselves on their conscience, jointly plan for national unity, implement true democracy, and exert transcendent justice to save dying compatriots. The descendants of Yan and Huang rely on this.</p>
<p>The Suffering of Northern Jiangsu!</p>
<p>(1)</p>
<p>Editor: More than half a year has passed since the end of the war, but the plains of northern Jiangsu, which were ravaged by the enemy army for seven years, are now facing another, more terrible enemy after the victory—the Communist Party! This is why half of Jiangsu Province is generally in a state of poverty, hunger, famine, and fierce "struggle" with the Communist Party. Let's take Huai'an and Huaiyin as examples: Since the news of victory spread here, the people were so happy that they jumped for joy, thinking that they could live and work in peace from now on, so they were waiting for the early arrival of the National Army every day. Who knew that in less than half a month, the surrounding Communist army was pressing in step by step, besieging the cities, and successively occupying the two county towns in two weeks. From then on, not only did the hundreds of thousands of people in these two counties have their hopes of living and working in peace dashed, but all the people in the counties occupied by the Communist army were being slaughtered, controlled, devastated, trampled on, and looted... The various phenomena are endless. Therefore, the men and women compatriots in the various counties of northern Jiangsu (referring to the counties occupied by the Communist army) have been fleeing and wandering outward in large numbers since September last year, almost every day. The large number of refugees gathered in the Yangzhou and Zhenjiang areas (the Sooning Branch of the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration has precise statistics), and the large number of temporary refugee governments of various counties in Yangzhou are an example. The current situation in the so-called "liberated areas" has been described in detail by others. Currently, the fields are barren, the population is sparse, commerce is declining, and the plowing cattle in the countryside have been robbed. The rice seedlings left for planting have also been robbed. One by one, the dilapidated homes have no food, no shelter, and are facing weed-covered wastelands, plowing cattle, plows, and seeds. In January and February of this year, representatives of the gentry in Baoying County appealed to the provincial authorities on behalf of the people living in the city (who could not flee), requesting the Sooning Branch of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration to allocate supplies—flour—to provide relief to the people in the city, so as to avoid starvation. This is another example. ——More than two months have passed since the closing of the Political Consultative Conference and the agreement to cease military conflicts, but the Communist Party's actions in northern Jiangsu are still based on its consistent style, "going its own way." On the night when the Executive Headquarters of the Military Mediation Department was in Nantong, they still took action to attack Baipu Town. Where is the "ceasefire"? Where is the "negotiation"? The people of northern Jiangsu are truly unfortunate to the extreme. What year? What month? Will I be able to return to my lovely hometown? We now want to shout out and demand that the government unify the military and political orders of Jiangsu, where the national capital is located, and save millions of people from fire and water and put them in a safe place. Chen Qing, a refugee from Huaiyin.</p>

<p>Editor: When writing this letter, tears and pen ran down together. Sir, you do not know the "good governance" of our northern Jiangsu. Now the Communist army in northern Jiangsu has launched a large-scale "struggle." After the struggle, several people are killed. At first, to be honest, I was also a believer in the Communist Party, and I had "respect" for "Leader" Mao Zedong. Now, it is not the same. Of course, I still have extraordinary "respect" for Mr. Mao, respecting "his" great "person" - to be able to let his subordinates do this, and he himself is like a mute, a blind man, and a deaf man! The Communist Party first forced the landlords to give the land rights to the tenant farmers, and then for every four acres of land, the landlord had to pay about ten shi of grain to the puppet "government." The landlords fled one after another, or took risks and did evil in order to make a living. In the areas of Shigang and Rugao, all non-thatched houses were demolished. Destruction is construction, in order to build completely egalitarian houses. Others are taking the bright road of civilization, while they are taking the road of restoring primitive life. If this goes on, the people will have no way to live, and the government still turns a blind eye! Yongbo</p>

<h3 id="e67">A Number Written in Blood: Fellow Jiangxi Compatriots Thirst for Relief <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>Although Jiangxi has never had a large-scale battle in the past eight years, it is located at the vanguard of Wuhan, on the right wing of the blood-soaked areas of Hunan, and in the rear of the coastal provinces of Zhejiang and Guangdong. At the same time, the Poyang Lake Basin was originally a famous granary in Jiangxi. Therefore, before the flames of war spread to Hunan and Hubei, the counties in northern Jiangxi were ravaged. After the two lakes became war zones and the enemy bandits in Zhejiang and Guangdong harassed the area, northwestern Jiangxi and eastern and southern Jiangxi became areas for enemy troops to detour and harass, and also served as supply areas for enemy bandits to plunder military and refined materials. Therefore, the breadth of its disaster area and the degree of suffering even far exceeded that of other major battlefield provinces. Of the 83 counties in the province, 63 were affected by the war! Here, let's take a look at a number written in blood by the people of Jiangxi during the eight years of war: (According to the Preliminary Summary Report on War Damage in the Province completed by the Statistics Office of the Jiangxi Provincial Government in January of the 35th year of the Republic of China)</p>
<p>1. Population Casualties: 504,450 people.</p>
<p>2. Property Losses: 935,516,781,856 yuan in national currency.</p>
<p>3. Housing Losses: 372,880 buildings. Among them, the losses in Nanchang City, Yongxiu, Gao'an, Wan'an, and other counties reached more than 75%.</p>
<p>4. Plowing Cattle Losses: 269,184 heads.</p>
<p>5. Transportation Losses: Only a small section of the Gan-Guo-Nan highway remains in the province. Only about 20 vehicles remain in the province, most of which are charcoal vehicles. The Nanxun Road and the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Road within the province were completely destroyed. Speaking of water transportation, it reminds people of the tragic scene of more than 600 large and small vessels being sunk by the enemy along the Gan River during their retreat last summer. The main dams of rivers and lakes in the province, totaling more than 3,000 kilometers in length, were destroyed by the enemy. Most of them were broken, and dangerous sections were breached everywhere. If the spring water rises sharply, floods will inevitably occur!</p>
<p>6. Industrial and Mining Power: Five heavy industrial plants and eighteen light industrial plants, as well as other private industries, have mostly ceased production. The tungsten and tin mines in Xihua Mountain in Dayu have also been destroyed. The Poyang, Leping, Tianhe, and Fengcheng coal mines have all stopped mining and are temporarily unable to recover.</p>
<p>In short, during the eight years of war, after repeated harassment and ravages by the enemy, more than 76% of the cities and villages in Jiangxi Province presented a picture of such tragic devastation! In addition to the food problem this spring, the prevailing epidemics, and the spring famine that will inevitably form, another thick shadow is cast on this dim picture!</p>
<p>"No food! No shelter! No seeds! No plowing cattle, not even the tools for plowing the land! And we still have to requisition surplus grain! Alas! How are we supposed to live!"</p>
<p>Please listen: This is the cry of the suffering people of Jiangxi demanding relief and demanding to be allowed to live! (Li Guohua from Nanchang)</p>

<h3 id="e69">Director Wang of the Ministry of Education's Statistics Department Analyzes Wartime Education: Extremely Slow Progress in Peacetime, Sudden and Rapid Advance Due to the War of Resistance <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Chongqing by This Newspaper] The statistical figures for education at all levels in China after the war have been repeatedly listed in this newspaper. Based on the statistical insights published by Director Wang Wanzhong of the Ministry of Education's Educational Statistics Department regarding the progress of education in the war zones and the Great Rear Area, a summary is recorded below:</p>
<p>National Statistics</p>
<p>(1) Looking at the country as a whole, in the 25th academic year before the War of Resistance, there were 18 million primary school children, 627,000 secondary school students, and 41,900 vocational and university students nationwide. The numbers all increased when the War of Resistance began, and then gradually increased again. In the 32nd academic year (end of July of the 33rd year), there were 18 million primary school students, 1.1 million secondary school students, and 78,900 vocational and university students (end of January of the 34th year). Compared with the pre-war period, the number of primary school students increased very little, the number of secondary school students increased by 75%, and the number of vocational and university students increased by 88%. If calculated based on the average progress from the first year of the Republic of China to the 25th academic year, it would take until the 44th year of the Republic of China to reach the current number of secondary school students, and until the 47th year of the Republic of China to reach the current number of vocational and university students. Now, thanks to the War of Resistance, it has been achieved more than ten years in advance.</p>
<p>(2) Considering the various provinces, cities, and regions separately, due to the different degrees of war damage, they are divided into (A) Guerrilla Areas, including the fifteen provinces and cities of Liaoning, Jilin, Rehe, Chahar, Suiyuan, Hebei, Shandong, Shanxi, Jiangsu, Ping, Tianjin, Qingdao, Beijing, and Shanghai; (B) War Zones, including the nine provinces of Zhejiang, Fujian, Anhui, Jiangxi, Henan, Hubei, Hunan, Guangdong, and Guangxi; (C) The Great Rear Area, including the ten provinces and cities of Shaanxi, Gansu, Ningxia, Qinghai, Xinjiang, Xikang, Sichuan, Yunnan, Guizhou, and Chongqing. Leaving aside the guerrilla areas for the moment, let us now divide the war zones and the Great Rear Area for discussion:</p>
<p>Statistics for the War Zones</p>
<p>(A) Regarding the nine provinces in the war zones, all have suffered considerable damage because some counties and districts have been reduced to war zones, but in addition to primary schools, secondary and higher education have made significant progress. In these nine provinces, the number of secondary school students before the war was 274,000, which increased to 540,000 in the 32nd academic year. The number of vocational and university students was originally 23,000, which increased to 40,000 in the 32nd academic year. If calculated based on the average progress from the first year to the 25th year of the Republic of China, it would take until the 53rd year of the Republic of China to reach this number of secondary school students. Now, thanks to the War of Resistance, it has been achieved more than 25 years in advance.</p>
<p>Statistics for the Great Rear Area</p>
<p>(B) Regarding the ten provinces and cities in the Great Rear Area, the number of primary school students in the 25th academic year was originally 3 million, which increased to 6.76 million in the 32nd academic year, an increase of more than double. The number of secondary school students was originally 107,000, which increased to 340,000 in the 32nd academic year, an increase of three times. The number of vocational and university students was originally 3,700, which increased to 16,200 in the 32nd academic year, an increase of more than four times. If calculated based on the average progress from the first year to the 25th year of the Republic of China, it would take until the 55th year of the Republic of China to reach the current number of primary school students, which is now 20 years ahead of schedule. It would take until the 85th year of the Republic of China to reach the current number of secondary school students, which is now 50 years ahead of schedule. The number of vocational and university students was 4,000 in the 20th year, but it decreased to 3,700 in the 25th year. After the war, it gradually increased, and by the 32nd academic year, it had increased sharply to 16,200. The number of years ahead of schedule cannot be calculated. (An)</p>

<p>[Dispatch from Chengdu by This Newspaper] In order to assist schools at all levels in solving various problems and addressing practical matters, the Sichuan Provincial Department of Education has specially established an Educational Guidance Group, composed of senior officials of the Department (heads of sections and above), totaling twelve members, with Chief Secretary Tang Shifang serving as the head of the group.

<p>[This City Dispatch] At 9:00 AM yesterday, the educational and cultural circles of this city held a grand tea party at the YMCA of the Eight Immortals to welcome Mr. Jiang Jianbai, the representative of the Ministry of Education stationed in the United States and the educational representative of the National Assembly, who recently returned to China.

<p>Pan Gongzhan's Welcoming Speech</p>
<p>Chairman Pan Gongzhan first delivered a welcoming speech, briefly stating: During the War of Resistance, when the National Army retreated westward, in order to reassure the educational and cultural workers who remained in Shanghai, Minister of Education Chen then sent Comrade Jiang Jianbai as the Ministry of Education's representative in Shanghai, responsible for strategizing everything and fighting against the enemy and puppets. The hardships and difficulties involved are self-evident. Later, due to the increasingly difficult situation, he could not stand his ground, and the central government ordered him to return to Chongqing to continue his educational work. He was then ordered to go to Burma, India, and the United States to work hard for the education of overseas Chinese and to investigate the educational situation in various parts of the United States. Today, we are gathered here, hoping that Comrade Jiang will contribute more of his knowledge of American education for our country's educators to refer to.</p>
<p>Jiang Jianbai's Impressions of Traveling in the United States</p>
<p>Mr. Jiang Jianbai then stood up and gave a speech, briefly stating: Since being dispatched to investigate American education in the 33rd year, he has traveled to important cities and villages throughout the United States. Observing the democratic concepts of the American people, everyone respects each other. Especially in American schools, teachers and students can participate in school administration. This is all due to the correctness of American democratic concepts. It is hoped that our country's education will emulate this approach. Then, Li Ximou, Zhou Feicheng, Chen Baohua, and others successively delivered speeches, which were full of vigilance and moved the listeners. The meeting adjourned near noon, and the principals of various secondary schools later held a public banquet for Mr. Jiang at the Jinjiang Restaurant, where drinks were exchanged and the guests and hosts dispersed with joy.</p>

<h3 id="e75">Reading Machine for the Blind Recently Invented by French Professor <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 24th] French Professor Te Sheng Kuntan has invented a machine specifically for the blind to read books. Documents typed with ordinary printed books, newspapers, or typewriters are placed on the machine, which can automatically emit the phonetic symbols of the letters on the book. Although the blind cannot read with their eyes, they can understand the full text by hearing the sounds. This type of machine is powered by electricity and comes in both fixed and portable versions. Its structure consists of a transparent plane on which the book or document to be read is placed. Below it is an optical instrument that can automatically move back and forth on the book surface, magnifying the letters several times and reflecting them on a rotating cylindrical glass body, which presents white transparent letters on a black background. Due to the change in the letters, the light passes through differently, resulting in vibrations. These vibrations are introduced into another cylindrical electronic device, which is equipped with film equipment. After the vibration of the aforementioned light passes through, it is broadcast through an amplifier, which can transmit the phonetic symbols of the letters into the human ear. The speed of the sound transmission can be adjusted according to the reader's wishes.</p>

(2) Teachers, regardless of whether they are public or private, will be treated equally in the future. (3) The subsidy for this semester will be increased from 54 million yuan to 200 million yuan. He expressed satisfaction that the private primary and secondary school teachers in this city had not adopted the method of striking, and urged that schools collecting the second phase of tuition fees should be absolutely transparent and reasonably allocated, and instructed the groups to cooperate in reporting violations in order to ensure legality and reasonableness.

<p>In the China-England football friendship match held at Yiyuan yesterday, Qingbai, riding the momentum of winning two major championships in a row, defeated the English Navy team 3-2. Mayor Qian and General Fraser, Commander of the British Pacific Fleet, performed the opening kick ceremony for yesterday's match. In addition to Mayor Qian, General Fraser, and their entourage, General Li, General Li Chongshi, Naval Xiamen Fortress Commander Liu Depu, and others were present in the VIP box. The English Navy lineup, except for goalkeeper Le Fumen, who briefly showed his face in the match against Hequn, was all new recruits. Qin Bigaog replaced Yan Shixin for Qingbai, and Huang Shijie was used as the goalkeeper. Cao Qiuting was absent and Luo Shoufu appeared on the field. The match consisted of two halves of forty minutes each. At the end of the match, Mayor Qian presented the guest team with a box of commemorative medals, which were accepted by General Fraser on their behalf. Although the weather was sultry yesterday, with the early summer season approaching, fans still flocked in, numbering no less than 8,000, and the atmosphere was quite enthusiastic.</p>
<p>Almost a Draw</p>
<p>The English Navy in yesterday's battle was slightly better than the previous few English Navy teams, but they still had more courage than intelligence, and their endurance was quite commendable. Qingbai was strong at first and then weak, not without a hint of complacency. It almost became a draw in the end, which was also quite dangerous. The final result was that Qingbai won 2-0 in the first half, and the English Navy won 2-1 in the second half, with the overall result being 3-2 in favor of Qingbai.</p>
<p>Two Goals Ahead</p>
<p>The match opened at 3:00 PM. After the two sides' lineups were set, referee Huang Renming blew the whistle, and Mayor Qian accompanied General Fraser to slowly enter the field to perform the opening kick ceremony. The mayor first moved the ball and handed it to Fraser, and the battle began. The English army gained the offensive first, and the Qingbai line was full of danger. Fortunately, Wu and Yan two guards did their best to maneuver and did not cause much problems. After ten minutes, Yan Shixin was replaced due to foot discomfort, and Qin Bigao entered the field. The two sides fell into a bitter battle. At 22 minutes, Li Yichen received a pass from Gu Yiche and shot from afar, scoring a goal and taking the lead. Qingbai's offensive then became even stronger. At 35 minutes, Li Sikao used the same trick again and broke the net, making it 2-0. The first half ended with Qingbai leading by two goals.</p>
<p>Qingbai Victory</p>
<p>In the second half, the English Navy's lineup remained unchanged, while Qingbai made many adjustments. The English army was determined to retaliate, and with its strong endurance, it charged left and right, which was quite impressive. At ten minutes, Owens slammed into the net, and Huang Shijie failed to save it. After 2-1, Qingbai had to put in more effort. At 25 minutes, Li Yichen received a long pass from the center back line, got the ball and shot, leveled, and sent it straight to the enemy's goal, Qingbai took the lead with two goals again, 3-1. The English army did not give up at this point, and finally Moore scored a goal to end the game, with the overall result still being Qingbai winning 3-2.</p>

<h3 id="e83">Ten Trends in American Education (Continued) <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>— Jiang Jianbai</p>
<p>(V) New Planning of Work Experience in Secondary Education: Recently, there has been a common trend in American education, namely that secondary education should pay special attention to acquiring work experience. It is generally believed that past secondary education was often impractical, placing too much emphasis on language training. Nineteen out of twenty secondary school graduates failed to enter university, and one-half of secondary school students did not complete high school. Urban secondary school students account for more than half, while rural secondary schools also account for more than half. Urban and rural secondary school students have not been closely linked to their possible years in school and the actual social needs after leaving school. Schools themselves have not been able to complete the training of work experience for young people entering society, nor have they been able to use various social undertakings to train students, resulting in no benefit to both society and individuals. Recently, educational organizations and leaders in secondary education have planned two supplementary secondary schools adapted to urban and rural areas. Each school focuses on the major industrial, commercial, agricultural, and domestic affairs of the city and countryside, and utilizes existing organizations in various industries in the city and countryside. According to individual needs and educational necessities, a central curriculum is adopted. Work experience courses are available from the beginning, but in smaller amounts. In later grades, these courses increase. Basic courses are available from the beginning, but these courses decrease in later grades. In addition, there are elective subjects for basic courses and work experience courses. For example, students who cannot continue their studies after completing the third year of junior high school are guided to select work experience subjects related to their interests in the third year. Students who can still go to college after graduating from high school are guided to select basic subjects. In this way, each grade can meet the requirements for employment and further education, and at the same time, each grade can learn work experience closely related to society. This is a flexible adaptation system. This type of school is called a flexible mixed secondary school, and the future trend may include vocational education, which is a new development that is bound to occur in the future.</p>
<p>(VI) Extension of the Number of Years of Education: The previous section explained the new planning of secondary education, which focuses on the work experience of most students. However, there are still many students who, even after graduating from high school, only about 70-80% go on to further education. Those who cannot go on to further education experience several phenomena: 1. It is not easy to find work. 2. Due to the increase in work standards and technology in various industries and businesses, young people need to improve their educational training. 3. Because the current age for high school graduation is 17 or 18, they are legally under 20 years old and have not yet formally obtained the rights of citizenship. During this transitional period, the state has a responsibility to bear. In order to assume full educational and legal responsibility for young people, the state should provide them with adequate education. Therefore, for high school graduates who can go on to further education or employment, there is the establishment of free intermediate colleges, with a duration of two years, with equal emphasis on general training and vocational training. During this period, if the student's family has better financial conditions, they can still enter the third year of university; otherwise, they can go out and find employment more easily. There are currently more than 600 intermediate colleges, with a small number run by private organizations, which is sufficient to illustrate this trend, which is steadily increasing.</p>
<p>(VII) Promotion of Intermediate Colleges and the 6-4-4 System: The previous section explained the extension of the number of years of education for young people and the establishment of intermediate colleges. This trend is related to the 6-4-4 system in secondary schools. Currently, the 6-3-3 system is the most common in the United States, and the 8-4 system is still common. Due to the establishment of intermediate colleges, there are two common phenomena: the 6-3-3-2 and 8-4-2 systems. Recently, in order to adapt to needs and seek adjustments, the 6-4-4 system has been established, which combines the six years of secondary school and the two years of intermediate college into eight years, divided into two four-year periods. That is, one year is added to the original three years of junior high school, and two years are added after the second year of the original three years of high school, so that those who cannot enter high school can get an extra year of primary education, and those who can enter high school can get two extra years of education. The main purpose is to improve the level and adapt to needs. This system is being implemented and has won the sympathy of the general education community, and will become a new type of school system.</p>
<p>(VIII) Advocacy of Humanistic Education: Universities and secondary schools have felt in the past that the division of labor is too detailed, dividing the entire body of knowledge into several fragments, so that the whole cannot be seen. As a result, students know one thing but not the other, and they cannot see the details of the principles of being a person, doing things, and the responsibilities of society and the country. Therefore, things must be reversed when they reach the extreme, and so-called general education has begun to be emphasized. For example, the Teachers College of Columbia University has for several years changed the required basic subjects of education, psychology, philosophy, politics, society, and economics into a mixed general course. Harvard University has established a committee to study ways to remedy deficiencies, and has determined that general education must be implemented in the first and second years of university, and in subsequent years, the basic cultivation will progress to gradual specialization. Yale University also has the same determination, and this is also necessary in secondary schools. Specialized vocational training must be rooted in basic general training. Therefore, the latest educational goals are set in four categories: namely, self-understanding, relating to others (humanities), social responsibility, and economic responsibility. This is closely related to the above-mentioned extension of the number of years of education for young people and the establishment of central courses, and will be the forerunner of future curriculum reforms.</p>
<p>(IX) Substantialization and Universalization of Vocational Education: The development of vocational education has produced several common trends: 1. Close connection between schools and industry and commerce. 2. Industry and commerce can utilize the talents trained by schools. 3. Training focuses on the specialized skills of a certain industry, and conforms to the conditions required by actual workers in industry and commerce. 4. Attention is paid to unit design, which is decided by the students themselves. 5. The precision of vocational guidance can truly meet the needs of students and solve some personal and professional problems. 5. Most of the teachers are selected from the industrial and commercial sectors and given educational training, so the teaching is practical. These items can be called substantialization, and will be strengthened in the future. Secondly, since the enactment of the Vocational Education Act of 1917, each state has a special management department. In the past ten years, the funding has increased to 600 million, with 2 million students. There are more than 8,000 industry organizations for vocational students. In addition to agriculture, industry, commerce, and domestic affairs, vocational subjects have been popularized to public affairs, health, transportation, safety, and social cooperation, family organization, and infant care. All undertakings that are beneficial to life will be included in vocational education. This can be called universalization, which is another trend in the future development of vocational education. Moreover, the development of vocational education and the above-mentioned general education seem to be contradictory, but vocational students are set up for those who cannot continue to receive general education, and must tend to specialize. However, in vocational education itself, there are recently many who advocate the appropriate implementation of general training, and there is a tendency to approach it in the future.</p>
<p>(X) Promoting Teacher Organizations and Improving Professional Training: The hardship of the teaching profession is the same everywhere. The income of most teachers in the United States is less than that of ordinary intermediate workers. From an economic standpoint, the development of industry and commerce is endless, while teachers have a certain limit. Therefore, the bargaining power of workers' unions against employers is huge, which has attracted the sympathy of teachers, and many teachers have joined as members. Many teacher groups have joined as joint bodies. The purpose is to unite forces to protest various inequalities in society and to gain a leading position. Many educational leaders believe that organization is power, and teachers should have teachers' organizations. The status and responsibilities of teachers are different from the nature of workers, and teachers should have independent organizations. With the power of this organization, the appropriate union and propositions should be determined according to the nature of each event. Each organization itself should have a strong belief, that is, to use the power of education to awaken the public, to exert popular power, to eliminate various social, political, and economic pressures, in order to seek the development of education and their own security. In recent years, educational organizations in the United States have sprung up like mushrooms, among which the Teachers Union, the Progressive Education Association, and the National Education Association have a wider range of activities and greater strength. Many leading figures in the American education community participate in the leadership, and the power of teacher organizations may occupy a leading position in the country in the future. However, in order to do so, teachers' own education and work efforts are necessary conditions for improving their own status and strengthening teacher organizations. Now almost all elementary school teachers are college graduates, and almost all secondary school teachers are graduate school graduates. The improvement of professional training has become a reality. Organization, training, and service are the driving force behind teacher welfare and security, and are also the overall goals of teachers' efforts in the future.</p>
<p>The above ten points are based on the major ones and existing trends. Other things, such as the universal military training of young people, have been proposed by the authorities and some educators, while others have opposed them. The underlying reason is not the military training itself, but the unwillingness of the federal government to obtain educational administrative power as a result. In the future, depending on the needs of the times, it may be changed to half a year or three months per term, and handled by federal personnel in consultation with various schools. Furthermore, the promotion of international culture and the advocacy of cooperative education are all needs of the times and have not yet become fixed, so they are not listed.</p>

<p>Government bonds reached new highs again yesterday, and there is no other reason to explain it except for the so-called manipulation by big players in the industry. The buyer's target remains unchanged, aiming for the end point of 120 times. Retail investors felt that the profits were considerable and followed suit. The narrow bond market is prone to ups and downs. Tong Bing opened struggling above 5,800 yuan, and was then pushed up by buying, rising gradually from 5,700 yuan, and seeing a high price of 6,250 yuan again, after which it became slightly static. As a result, it closed 500 yuan higher than the previous close. Miscellaneous brands, because Tong Bing had soared for many days, were generally chosen as cheaper options yesterday, bringing up quite a few, with A, B, and D each rising 700-800 yuan. E was hotter, jumping 950 yuan alone. Transactions are still in guerrilla style, so police officers can only disperse them from time to time, and the situation was serious for a while, but they were soon released after being caught and warned.</p>
<h3 id="e85">Chinese Stocks Trend Weak, Foreign Stocks Also React: Yi Sha and British United Both Fall <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>The trend of Chinese stocks has weakened, and the state of madness is no longer seen, so general hot money has become tired of it over time, and interest has gradually decreased. The initial firmness of each popular stock has continued to weaken, not deviating from the old tune of the previous few days. Small-cap Qin Xing launched itself with Xin Guang as the target, hoping to achieve something because the three hot companies were holding meetings at the same time. Yesterday, Xin Guang fell in the market, and Qin Xing continued to advance, and the distance between the two narrowed again. I don't know what the always active Xin Guang authorities think. When it was in its best state at the beginning, Yong Sha was 5,280 yuan, Mei Ya was 4,400 yuan, Jing Fu was 445 yuan, and Xin Guang was 390 yuan, and then it gradually shrank, while Qin Xing rose steadily after 300 yuan, going in the opposite direction. The colder China Underwear received attention and the situation was slightly better. The results of the afternoon close compared to the previous close were flat for the three hot stocks of Yong Sha, Mei Ya, and Jing Fu, Xin Guang fell 11 yuan, and Qin Xing rose 20 yuan alone. The cold stocks were generally stable, but underwear rose slightly. It is said that the company will specialize in wholesale afterwards, save expenses, and sell off the facade to recover the shares. Foreign stocks are still within the scope of securities gangs, and have reacted slightly. Small amounts of floating inventory in the hands of foreign merchants were released at high prices, and high prices could not last. Yi Sha once saw 15,400 yuan on the market, and then fell back. People in the securities gang saw that the situation was not good, and paused slightly, selling some of them off, and then struggled around 15,000 yuan, and the situation turned sideways. The afternoon close was slightly lower than the previous day for each popular stock. British United retreated behind Yi Sha again because the old were releasing slightly. The rise and fall of small stocks were slight.</p>
<h3 id="e86">Yarn Prices Generally Rise: Yangtze River and Wenmin Areas Are Selling Well <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the yarn market became more solid. Although the Yue and Tianjin gangs did not purchase in large quantities, customers from the Yangtze River and Wenmin areas purchased sporadically, which was very enthusiastic. Most of the 20-count yarn were sold out and short, and generally rose by 10,000-20,000 yuan. 16-count was also selling well. Fine yarn was very mediocre, but 32-count Hong Yu single yarn rose by 80,000 yuan alone yesterday because the yarn was left over from a Japanese factory and had been repeatedly sold by auction by the Spinning and Construction Company, and had been sold out last Friday. The industry searched for it at low prices because there was no auction price yesterday afternoon. The Spinning and Construction Company opened 30 types of old cotton cloth and 17 types of American and Mexican cloth yesterday. It will sell woolen fabrics, beiges, and cotton yarn as usual today.</p>
<h3 id="e87">Gold and Banknotes Are Mediocre <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>The gold bar opened at 1.56 million yesterday morning, and after opening, it fell slightly to 1.54 million. Afterwards, the demand for supply was scarce, and the market was stable. Until noon, it hovered around 1.55 million. The silver houses slightly accepted, and the situation was slightly firmer. The result was similar to the previous close, and the trend was balanced. The silver houses listed gold ornaments at 166,000, silver at 1,600, and silver dollars were still flat. The underground dismantling of silver funds was relaxed, and the interest rate was from 10% to 15%. It was still not easy for those with funds to find a counterparty.</p>
<p>Foreign currency US dollars were slightly weaker in the middle of yesterday. It opened at 2,160 yuan with sellers, and saw a low price of 2,135 yuan after opening, and then gradually stabilized. At noon, it hovered around 2,160 yuan, with little trading, and the process was extremely mediocre. It continued to be stable in the afternoon, and the result was slightly higher than the previous close by 10 yuan. Hong Kong banknotes were newly flat and old ones were stable. Hong Kong exchange rate was 420 yuan with sellers. General foreign firms can now directly order Robi for Indian cotton settlement, and the previous method of settlement through Hong Kong can be removed, so Robi was 520 yuan to 540 yuan, and those who settled were slightly more enthusiastic.</p>
<h3 id="e88">Spot Cotton Trading Is Still Smooth <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the New York American Cotton Telegraph newspaper fell 17 to 29 pounds, calculated at 27.65 for near-term American dollars, 27.82 for forward, and 28.26 for Metering spot. Spot cotton trading in this port is still smooth. The Silk Spinning and Construction Company also began to absorb about 1,000 bales of Metering, and the industry's decorative trading is not lonely. The market price is higher than before.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the price of white sugar continued to rise strongly. The association's initial quotation in the morning was 54,000 yuan, then rose to 55,000 yuan, and further rose to 56,500 yuan in the afternoon, but there were not many sellers, and the asking price was 58,500 yuan. Raw sugar was quoted at 52,000 yuan, and other sugars were cheaper.</p>
<h3 id="e90">Artificial Silk Rises Slightly <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the market price of rayon rose generally by 10,000 to 30,000 yuan due to the stimulus of the rationing price. 120 Tianqiao opened at 1.4 million yuan and closed at 420,000 yuan, which was 10,000 yuan higher than the previous day. Miscellaneous brands of semi-gloss and 150 glossy rose by 20,000 to 30,000 yuan. The market price of factory silk did not change much. The industry traded slightly. Five loads of Qianjing were transacted at 1.32 million yuan. The price of American Asia quilt surface in the silk market was stable, and Dazheng grid crepe showed a slight improvement. Hang Su goods were in short supply. Recently, the exchange rate has been very strong, and Linji wax feather yarn is 1,800 yuan per yard.</p>
<h3 id="e91">Rice Prices See Slight Retraction, Flour Price Increase Resurges <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the rice market continued to have supply, and the digestion was flat. Japonica and indica rice both retracted slightly by about 1,000 yuan, and Baiyuan also retracted by slightly more than 1,000 yuan. Other grains, on the other hand, went in the opposite direction and rose unanimously. Flour from Shantou and Ningbo competed for supplies, and the demand was very strong. The price rose sharply by 2,000 yuan, and the supply still could not meet the demand. The oil market also saw active zeroing, and continued to rise by 3,000 to 4,000 yuan. Soybeans added another 500 to 600 yuan, bean cakes saw a tight supply of 100 to 200 yuan, and bean skins had a very smooth sales path, rising another 500 yuan. Red beans were slightly advanced by the Hong Kong gang, and still hovered at a high peak. According to the rice market, yesterday this city arrived with seven types of white japonica, totaling more than 6,000 shi. The types and number of shi are as follows: white japonica 2,845 shi, Du Xian 826 shi, Yin Yuan 25 shi, Yang Xian 56 shi, early rice 1,502 shi, thin rice 1,365 shi, Bai Yuan 175 shi.</p>
<p>Also, according to rice industry news, 30,000 shi of food rice will arrive here gradually within the next week. The market price of this batch of rice, which was collected by various rice firms and merchants in this city at the beginning of this month, is roughly only half of the current price, so the procurement cost is quite low. Once it arrives in Shanghai, the supply of spot goods on the market can be increased, and the price of rice will definitely fall at that time. At the same time, the various rice-producing areas are now relying on farmers to release large quantities of stored rice for cash, so it seems that it has become much easier for rice merchants to handle goods, but there are slight obstacles in water and land transportation, and it is still necessary for the relevant authorities to cooperate effectively. According to a rice industry giant, although the total amount of food stored in this city has not been accurately counted, it is quite considerable and sufficient for the needs of the entire city for a long time.</p>

Another company, Fukang, received 40 million yuan. The other seven companies, including Xinfengsheng, Shuntaide, Quantai, Tairun, Rongfeng, Daxing, and Yongyu, have not been allocated loans and will jointly request the Office of the Special Commissioner of Food Administration, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Bureau of Social Affairs, and the Senate to treat them equally and provide them with loans.</p>

The price of coconut oil plummeted from 300,000 to about 200,000 due to the large number of arrivals in Hong Kong, with few transactions. Only talcum powder rose to 400,000 per ton due to the lack of spot supply.</p>
<h3 id="e96">United States Assists Allied Reconstruction, Seeks to Lift Export Controls, Congressional Opinion Is Counterproductive <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>[Reuters Washington 23rd] According to the Commercial Daily, the US State Department will seek to lift certain export controls in order to assist the economic reconstruction of Allied nations. This attitude is contrary to the views of people in Congress, who believe that the export of scarce commodities will hinder domestic recovery and housing plans. At the same time, some in Congress have proposed banning the export of timber and textiles, but it is believed that the US government will firmly oppose this, and these proposals are unlikely to pass. The State Department believes that domestic housing plans should not be interfered with, but banning the export of washing machines, radios, and vacuum cleaners would hinder US relations with Allied nations. Conversely, lifting export restrictions on certain important machines, such as bearings, could help Allied industries recover sooner without having to rely entirely on US supplies.</p>
<p>The newspaper also said that Commerce Secretary Wallace, when meeting with reporters, explained the department's recommendation to extend the Export Control Act for another year, saying that the department had to continue to implement controls on exports, given the great need for certain scarce commodities for domestic consumption. Wallace continued: Congress and the general public believe that even if the Department of Commerce cancels export controls, this matter will be difficult to implement due to the de facto need for export restrictions. However, the department has made every effort to reduce the export goods that need to be restricted as much as possible.</p>
<h3 id="e97">U.S. Silk Market Competition Between Japan, China, and Italy <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>[United Press, New York, 22nd] According to the Commercial Daily News, some major silk merchants have announced they are willing to pay a maximum of nine dollars per pound for newly imported Japanese silk. The batch of raw silk totals 2,600 pounds and is currently under inspection by Holbaggen. According to the inspection company, the silk is valued at approximately $2 million, or six dollars per pound. This Japanese silk is the initial import, with future monthly arrivals expected to reach 10,000 bales (133 pounds per bale), imported by the government-owned U.S. Trading Company. The silk will be sold within a few weeks. Women's hosiery manufacturers and other silk fabric producers are increasingly impatient with the Office of Price Administration's failure to revise or remove price ceilings. Hosiery manufacturers claim that the sale of raw silk will be delayed until retail price ceilings are removed or modified. Raw silk price ceilings were removed in January of this year. Some manufacturers hope silk stockings can be available by the end of May. The Commercial Daily News also reports that three large batches of Japanese silk, several batches of Chinese silk, and three batches of Italian silk are expected to be shipped to the U.S. before the end of this month. The first batch of Italian silk comprises 783 bales, weighing 54,612 kilograms. Market reports indicate that Italian silk can be sold for $10.75 to $11.25 per pound, while over 600 bales of Chinese silk are expected to arrive within the month. Chinese and Italian silk are purchased by silk merchants, while Japanese silk imports continue to be managed by the government.</p>
<p>[United Press, New York, 22nd] Eastern U.S. silk fabric manufacturers anticipate that competition from imported silk from China, Japan, and Italy will lower prices in the U.S. and other world silk markets. According to a report from the International Statistical Bureau's market advisory division, the recent high prices of raw silk and silk products are expected to decrease significantly but will still be higher than pre-war levels. The government-owned War Assets Corporation sold 3,000 bales of surplus raw silk in February of this year at $11.75 per pound. However, hosiery manufacturers offered as much as $22.25 per pound for high-quality silk.</p>

<p>To stabilize the financial situation in Tianjin, major commercial organizations in the city recently convened a meeting of relevant responsible parties. It is reported that six measures have been resolved: 1. Gold shops are prohibited from large-scale trading of pure gold and from arbitrarily setting prices. 2. Grain merchants are prohibited from hoarding food or engaging in speculative sales. 3. Securities firms are prohibited from speculative trading and manipulating market prices. 4. Businessmen in all industries must operate within their primary business and are not allowed to engage in businesses outside their industry. 5. Non-businessmen are prohibited from accumulating debt. 6. Government officials are strictly prohibited from engaging in business. It is reported that the above six measures will be implemented after being reported to the competent authorities for record-keeping and then announced for enforcement.</p>
<h3 id="e99">Excessive Taxation on Chinese Goods in the Philippines: Ad Valorem Tax is Too Unfair <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>The volume of goods exported from our country to the Philippines is increasing daily. However, in addition to goods subject to specific duties, those subject to ad valorem taxes bear an excessively heavy burden. This is because the Philippine customs authorities still calculate taxes based on an exchange rate of one Chinese yuan to 0.45 U.S. dollars. Thus, goods worth 1,000 yuan are converted by Philippine customs to 450 U.S. dollars, equivalent to 900 Philippine pesos. For example, ready-made garments are subject to a 25% ad valorem tax, so a T-shirt worth 1,000 yuan in Chinese currency, equivalent to 450 U.S. dollars, would be taxed at 112.5 U.S. dollars (i.e., 225 Philippine pesos). This increases costs and impacts sales. It is reported that our consulate in the Philippines is negotiating with Philippine customs, requesting that calculations be based on the exchange rate quoted by Chinese banks, which is 0.5 U.S. dollars or 1 Philippine peso per 1,000 yuan. However, there has been no response from Philippine customs.</p>

<h3 id="e101">U.S. Needs Hog Bristles: Question of Export Tax Reduction/Exemption Submitted to the Tariff Commission for Review; Britain Also Transporting Bristles from Chongqing to Hong Kong <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>Hog bristles for export account for a major portion of our country's exports. Before the war, our annual hog bristle exports were approximately 100,000 piculs. In recent years, American industry has developed rapidly, and hog bristles have a wide range of industrial uses. Therefore, the United States has a strong need for them, and this need will undoubtedly increase in the future. The U.S. relies primarily on our country for the supply of hog bristles, accounting for 60-70% of our total exports. Recently, it has been reported that the New York hog bristle market is experiencing high demand and limited supply. The market price once rose from $2.56 (USD) to $3.50 per pound. Now, with more goods arriving, the price has gradually fallen to $3.12. According to traders, the price of Chinese hog bristles in New York will likely hover around $3 for some time and is unlikely to change significantly in the near future.</p>
<p>Among hog bristle businesses in our country, the Sichuan Livestock Products Company enjoys a strong reputation overseas. During the war, the company focused on purchasing in the southwest. After the victory, it actively expanded its operations, establishing offices in Hankou in Central China, Tianjin in North China, and Shanghai in the Southeast region. In the past six months, the company has shipped approximately 5,000 piculs of standard hog bristles to the U.S. With large quantities of bristles now entering the market in various regions, the company is actively engaged in purchasing. According to the manager of the Shanghai branch, Mr. Zhi Xiang, the company can purchase 20,000 piculs domestically this year to be shipped to the U.S. for sale. Recently, the price of bristles per picul in the domestic market is over 600,000 yuan in Chongqing (based on the 27th grade), over 700,000 yuan in Hankou (based on the 17th grade), 540,000 to 550,000 yuan in Shanghai (lower quality, still based on the 17th grade), and 700,000 to 800,000 yuan in Tianjin due to better quality.</p>
<p>The hog bristle producing regions in our country, including Sichuan, Kang, Yunnan, and Guizhou provinces, produce approximately 20,000 piculs annually, Central and Southeast China produce 15,000 to 16,000 piculs, and North China produces 70,000 to 80,000 piculs. The total production is likely over 100,000 piculs. Currently, foreign businesses are the strongest force in purchasing and shipping bristles in the Tianjin area, so they handle the largest quantities. Packing hog bristles for shipment from Shanghai to the U.S. costs over 40 U.S. dollars per picul (the cost is higher if transshipment is required). The export tax is 0.75%. An additional 0.25% in Huangpu surcharges is added for exports from Shanghai, totaling approximately 1% in taxes. The company has 2,000 to 3,000 piculs of hog bristles still in transit from Chongqing to Shanghai. It is reported that the current hog bristle inventory in Shanghai is extremely low, with only over 1,000 piculs awaiting export. Therefore, the current hog bristle price standard in Shanghai still depends on the production areas and the New York sales market.</p>
<p>[Additional News] Regarding the recent request from hog bristle export companies to the authorities to reduce or exempt hog bristle export taxes, it has been confirmed that the Ministry of Finance has submitted the request to the National Tariff Commission for further review and consideration of reduction or exemption. An official announcement will be made in the coming days.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 23rd] A reporter recently inquired of Mr. Mackinder, the Parliamentary Secretary for Overseas Trade, whether the authorities have taken steps to airlift Chinese hog bristle stocks to the United States. Mr. Mackinder replied that some hog bristles have already been airlifted from Chongqing to Hong Kong, awaiting shipment to Britain.</p>

<h3 id="e102">The Inevitable White Man <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>— Original by Jack London, translated by Lu Mang</p>
<p>[“The black man will never understand the white man, and the white man will never understand the black man, until the names by which the black man calls the black man and the white man calls the white man are abolished.”]</p>
<p>Captain Woodward said this. We were in the conference room of the Charlie Roberts Hotel in Apia, drinking Abuhumanda for a long time, which was mixed for us by the Charlie Roberts mentioned above, and he drank with us. He declared that this mixing method was passed down directly from Stephens, who was famous for inventing this Abuhumanda wine when he was being urged on by the Nile River—this Stephens was responsible for 'achieving the dismantling of Tum,' and he died in the siege of Ladysmith.</p>
<p>The elderly Captain Woodward was fat and short, with forty years of scorching tropical sun behind him. He had the most beautiful, watery brown eyes I had ever seen in a man, speaking from his extensive experience. The crisscrossing scars on his bald head testified to a close encounter with black men's axes, and similarly indicative of a close encounter were the front and back of the right side of his neck, where there was a visible hole once pierced by an arrow. According to his explanation, he was somewhat hasty in that matter—he couldn’t pull the arrow out. He felt he couldn’t remove the arrowhead for a moment, so he pulled out the shaft as it had been shot in. At this time, he was the mate of the Sapei, a large steamer that was transporting workers from the West to the German colonies in the Samoan Islands.</p>
<p>“Half of the disputes are due to the stupidity of the white man,” Roberts said, pausing to take a big gulp from his glass and cursing a Samoan busboy with familiar words. “If a white man would only allow himself to understand a little bit about what the black man is thinking, most of the troubles would be eliminated.”</p>
<p>“I have seen some people who claim that they understand the black man,” Captain Woodward replied, “and I always noticed that they were the first ones to be eaten. Just look at the missionaries in New Guinea and the New Hebrides—the island of martyrs in Erromanga, and all the rest. Just look at the Australian expeditions that were cut to pieces in the jungles of Guadalcanal in the Solomon Islands. And just look at the merchants themselves, with twenty years of experience, boasting that no black man would ever find their heads, and their heads still decorate the oak trees of those canoe houses today. There was also Old John Simmons—spending twenty-six years on the uncivilized border of Melanesia, swearing that he understood the black man like he understood a book, and that they would never harm him. But he ended his life by Lake Malofu in New Georgia. His head was sawn off by a black woman and an old black man with only one leg (the other leg was lost in the mouth of a shark when he went into the water to catch fish blasted with gunpowder). There was also Belivo, who had a terrible reputation for killing black men, a character whom even a devil would be afraid of. I remember lying on a small corner of New Ireland, you know, when the black men stole half a can of tobacco for sale—causing him a loss of about three and a half gold dollars. He wanted revenge, shot dead a big black man, destroyed some of their war canoes, and burned down two villages. Also in the small corner, four years later, he and the fifty Bukou lads he hired to catch sea cucumbers were attacked by surprise. Within five minutes, they were all dead, except for three lads who escaped in a canoe. Don’t talk to me about understanding the black man. The mission of the white man is to develop the world, and that is busy enough for him. What time does he have left to understand the black man?”</p>
<p>“That’s right,” Roberts said. “After all, it seems that understanding the black man is not entirely necessary. The white man’s development of the world is the direct result of his stupidity—"</p>
<p>“And putting the fear of God into the black man's heart,” Captain Woodward blurted out. "Maybe you're right, Roberts. Maybe it's his stupidity that makes him successful, and one manifestation of his stupidity must be his inability to understand the black man. But one thing is certain, the white man cannot but rule the black man, whether he understands them or not. It is inevitable, it is destiny."</p>
<p>"Of course the white man is inevitable—this is the black man's destiny," Roberts interjected. "Tell the white man that there are pearl clams at the bottom of some lake, surrounded by ten thousand cannibalistic people yelling, and he will go there alone, with only five or six Hawaiian divers and an accurate alarm clock, all squeezed like sardines into a light, five-ton double-masted boat. Just whisper that there is a gold deposit in the Arctic, and that same inevitable white-skinned creature will set off immediately, with shovels and picks, salt pork, and the latest model of windlass—and, well, he will get there. Tell him that there are diamonds in the fiery fortress of hell, and Mr. White Man will go to make a ruckus at the fortress, and make old Satan himself engage in the work of picks and clocks. All that is caused by stupidity and inevitability."</p>
<p>“But I don’t understand what the black man thinks about that—that inevitability,” I said.</p>
<p>Captain Woodward was smiling quietly. There was a light of memory in his eyes.</p>
<p>"I am not understanding what the black men of Mariu are thinking about that inevitable white man, who was on our ship when we sailed there on the Duchess, then and now," he explained.</p>
<p>Roberts mixed three more glasses of Abuhumanda.</p>
<p>"That was twenty years ago. His name was Saxdorf. He was really the most stupid man I had ever seen, but he was as inevitable as death. That guy could only do one thing, and that was shoot a gun. I remember the first time I met him—right here in Apia, twenty years ago. That was before you came out, Roberts. I was sleeping at the Dutchman Henry's Inn, which is now over by the market. Where had he been? He made a lot of money smuggling arms to the rebels, sold his inn, and was shot dead in Sydney six weeks later, in a bar fight. (To be continued)</p>

<p>The clouds lifted the rising red sun, and the dimness of the night gradually fled from the depths of the river.</p>
<p>The herdsman led out dozens of warhorses again, quietly strolling on this green hillside, spreading his hands and watching the unburdened horses. He turned his head and neighed for a while, and gradually scattered, leisurely... The herdsman smiled, no longer remembering the tension given by the past war, but felt a slippery sensation on his feet. Looking down along the shadow, it turned out to be the dew of early spring, shaken off by his loose cloth shoes, wetting his toes from the green grass!</p>

<p>Don't think this smell is unpleasant; it is the mark of the highest beauty!</p>
<p>Soil, the mother of mankind. It nurtures countless lives, for us to admire, for us to enjoy. Soil, the mother of mankind. Whether noble or lowly, we will all quietly rest in its embrace.</p>
<p>Compared to the soil, our lives are so small, so insignificant. But it loves us equally, caresses us, its whole life dedicated to us.</p>

<p>— Tang Liyan</p>
<p>Southeast region of scenic splendor, site of six dynasties' prosperity. Young nobles picking flowers, unrestrained sons dropping whips, vying in song and dance arenas, amidst rouge-painted ranks. There are Qin Towers and Chu Mansions, Yue Maidens and Wu Belles, with light and heavy makeup, competing for beauty, rapid pipes and urgent strings, metal castanets and bronze drums. King Chen ultimately was sullen and unhappy, looked left and right and sighed, leaned on the armrest feigning sleep, concentrated and was one with his spirit, as if someone, gracefully emerged. This person was ample with surplus, gentle as boneless, her song as fairy dew and bright pearls, dawn wind and remnant moon, a fairy maiden of the ninth heaven, leaving a lingering echo in the human world, a lone wild goose at night, bringing sad wind to the treetops. Moreover, she was as slender as willows, radiant as lotus flowers, her eyes like flowing lightning, her skin like solidified grease, gazing at distant mountains like dark eyebrows, her spring intention as intoxicating as butter, as if treading waves of the Luo River, neither smoke nor mist, suspecting a witch cloud entering a dream, seeming to be there and not to be there. Thereupon King Chen was eagle-like and vigorous, raising his cup to invite the moon, composing a song for a beautiful woman, singing: The beauty beckons me at the edge of the clouds, I want to follow her but the road is long and arduous, the heavenly wind is rustling and cannot but feel cold, turning sideways to gaze east and tears flow in abundance. Gonggan calmly regarded everything, also harmonizing with words, saying: Beauty, oh beauty, I don't know if you are evening rain or morning clouds? I want to follow you but the Milky Way has no ford! The curved moon hangs diagonally before the window, suddenly seeing plum blossoms I suspect it is you, so they sang alternately, melancholically returning.</p>

<p>— Zhao Qingge</p>
<p>Li Yun did not answer, but handed the letter to Mrs. Mo.</p>
<p>Mrs. Mo couldn't read, so she had Bao Ling read it to her. It said:</p>
<p>"I am now returning to Beijing with Shi Yulou! I don't want to tell Xiao Yun, and I certainly can't take her with me. Fortunately, you are here, so I specially entrust her to you, hoping you will consider our sisterly affection and raise her for me. There will be a day of repayment in the future. To avoid causing a stir, please forgive me for not saying goodbye in person."</p>
<p>It turned out to be a letter of entrustment. After Bao Ling finished reading, she exclaimed in surprise to Li Yun:</p>
<p>"What? Your mother ran away?"</p>
<p>Li Yun cried even more upon hearing Bao Ling's question.</p>
<p>"Say less!" Mrs. Mo spat at Bao Ling. She held Li Yun and comforted her, "Don't cry, Xiao Yun! Move to your aunt's house today and live here. Your aunt will be your mother from now on! Your aunt will love you." After saying this, she asked Li Yun, "Did your mother give you this letter? Does your father know?"</p>
<p>Li Yun finally spoke. She shook her head and sobbed:</p>
<p>"No, this letter was given to me by my father. Mother left this morning. My father actually saw Mother leaving. But Father said he pretended not to see it. Mother left the letter on my bed. After she left, Father woke me up and told me, 'Mother won't be coming back.' He told me to take this letter and find my aunt. I immediately wanted to chase Mother back, but Father wouldn't allow it. He said, 'It's good that Mother left, it's better that she left sooner!'"</p>
<p>"Strange, what does your father mean by this? He wants your mother to leave sooner. Does he want to marry a third or fourth wife?" Mrs. Mo said indignantly.</p>
<p>"Uncle Weng always sleeps in the morning, how come he got up so early today?" Bao Ling interjected, asking Li Yun.</p>
<p>"I don't know," Li Yun replied to Bao Ling, equally puzzled.</p>
<p>At this moment, Mrs. Mo felt very conflicted. She didn't object to Mrs. Weng's departure, and she had expected it would happen one day. Mrs. Weng had also hinted at it to her intentionally or unintentionally. But she felt a sense of farewell! Because Mrs. Weng had been with her for more than ten years, and now she suddenly left, she naturally couldn't help but miss her! At the same time, she thought about her future days, which would become even more lonely because of this! So she also somewhat selfishly resented Shi Yulou!</p>
<p>Perhaps Mrs. Mo was also a little jealous of Mrs. Weng. She had secretly said to herself: If she were ten years younger, couldn't she also be like Mrs. Weng – "gone"? But she was old, and no one would want to take her away. Also, her son was already grown up, and she couldn't abandon him. All her hopes in life were pinned on her son. She had to wait to enjoy her son's blessings, she wanted to get the price of her half-life sacrifice from her son. Although, at present, she could only possess half of her son, the other half being invaded by Mr. Mo, she believed that after Mr. Mo's death, her son would ultimately belong to her. Thinking of this, Mrs. Mo quietly felt happy and relieved again. At this time, she looked up and saw Bao Ling standing right next to her. She saw Bao Ling's fair face and bright eyes, and felt boundless comfort and love! So, in a gentle tone that she hadn't used in days, she affectionately called out to Bao Ling:</p>
<p>"Bao Ling!" Mrs. Mo called out blankly, and then felt it was a bit meaningless. With a flash of inspiration, she found a topic to change the subject and said gently. "Go to your godfather's place and bring your cousin's bedding over. Tell your Uncle Weng that Mother is keeping your cousin Yun to live in our house for a long time."</p>
<p>Bao Ling agreed and walked out.</p>

<p>Shen Liming asks: Mr. A and Ms. B have been married for just over a year. Mr. A used to work as a porter. Once, after Mr. A left, it is unknown whether he was arrested for carrying contraband or for some other accident. It has been over two years since then, and there has been no news. Ms. B has no means of support and has long since returned to her mother's house. Now, Ms. B's mother wants to remarry her. Is this legally permissible? Please advise.</p>
<p>Lawyer Ya Xia replies: Mr. A has already married Ms. B, so Ms. B can only remarry after this marriage relationship has been terminated. "Now Ms. B's mother wants to remarry her," which is not in accordance with the law. Because the law stipulates that "a person with a spouse shall not commit bigamy." If Ms. B herself wishes to remarry, she must wait until Mr. A's whereabouts are unknown for more than three years and apply to the court for a divorce from Mr. A before she can do so.</p>
<p>Xian Zhu Xuan asks: The reader mortgaged four bungalows belonging to Deng on November of the 21st year of the Republic, agreeing on the day that the mortgage rent was 800 silver dollars, and the monthly rent was 4 silver dollars, with a fixed term of five years. At the end of the term, the landlord Deng should return the original mortgage price to the mortgagor Gu in full. A contract was drawn up, with each party holding a copy. When the five-year term expired in November of the 26th year, the landlord Deng did not prepare the money for redemption. Later, because of the war that year, the reader moved west with the government. It has been over eight years since then. Both parties urgently need to resolve this matter. The following solutions are proposed: (1) Since the house has not been redeemed within the time limit, who owns the ownership? Does it belong to the landlord or the mortgagor? (2) If the ownership of the house still belongs to the landlord, how many times the original mortgage price should the landlord redeem it for? (3) The reader wants to increase the original mortgage price of 800 yuan tenfold, i.e., 8,000 yuan, and establish another pawn contract with a term of five years, calculated from the date of the contract. (4) If the landlord cannot resolve the above-mentioned matters satisfactorily, can the reader resort to law? Please provide a detailed answer.</p>
<p>Lawyer Cao Ya Xia replies: (1) According to Article 923, Paragraph 2 of the Civil Code: "If the mortgagor does not redeem the mortgaged property at the original mortgage price within two years after the expiration of the mortgage term, the mortgagee shall obtain ownership of the mortgaged property." However, Article 7 of the Supplementary Regulations for Handling Civil Litigation After the Restoration, which was promulgated and implemented on December 18, 1945, stipulates: "If the period for exercising rights stipulated in the Civil Code or other laws cannot be observed due to war, the rights may still be exercised within two years after the implementation of these regulations." Therefore, the ownership should still belong to the house owner. (2 and 3) The law does not stipulate this. The two parties should consider the social and economic situation, the living conditions of the mortgagor, and the extent of the losses suffered due to the war, and decide through negotiation. (4) If resorting to law, you can follow the provisions of Article 12 of the Supplementary Regulations for Handling Civil Litigation After the Restoration: "If, after the establishment of a legal act, circumstances change due to reasons not attributable to the parties, which could not have been foreseen at the time, and the original effect is obviously unfair, the court should fairly measure and make a judgment to increase or decrease the payment or change other original effects." You can request the court to make a judgment to increase the payment.</p>

<p>Seeking a Specialist Doctor to Treat Deafness</p>
<p>To the editor: My daughter has been mute since childhood, only able to produce simple sounds. Upon closer examination of the cause of her muteness, it is entirely due to the lack of sensitivity of her eardrums. She can usually hear loud noises, but cannot absorb soft sounds at all, so she has no opportunity to learn language. Recently, I read an article translated by Mr. Liu Zudong in the 22nd volume, 8th issue, of the Students' Magazine published by the Commercial Press, "Deafness Restored," from the February 1945 Reader's Digest, which says: "Open a small window in the back of the ear, take a piece of cartilage from the outer ear, trim it, and install it in the small hole, then paste the inner ear membrane previously pulled and tapped to make it firm. The cartilage plug acts as a new stapes, which can transmit sound to the inner ear..." This makes me feel that my daughter's defect can certainly be saved. Shanghai is a concentration of scientific talent, and there should be outstanding doctors who can perform this type of surgery. I would like to borrow a corner of your newspaper to solicit on my behalf, so that my daughter can be cured and restored to hearing. This would be entirely due to your column. If you can enable those with the same condition to meet a savior, it is not only I who would be grateful. Sincerely, Cheng Enxian, at the Social Service Column of Shen Bao.</p>
