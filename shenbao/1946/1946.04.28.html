<h3>馬歇爾調處入新階段　艾北陰霾漸呈開朗　停戰令下週初可頒布</h3>
<p>〔本報重慶廿七日電〕陰霾險夷之東北政局，速日經民主同盟，靑年黨及無黨無派等第三方面人士之多方奔走，對東北停戰商談之積極進行，使馬帥調處商談工作轉進一新階段，而略呈開朗之現象。昨日上午十時，馬帥再度邀晤羅隆基，張君勱二氏，討論停止東北軍事衝突及澄淸東北嚴重情勢之步驟與方案，惟馬帥態度嚴肅謹愼，對於和平及東北政局具有堅强信心。馬齜原定今日離渝飛京，但以東北情勢驚人惡化，決待蔣主席返渝，令使東北停戰問題獲得協議後，再定行期。又悉：昨晚七時，民主同盟代表團邀晤中共代表周恩來，交換東北問題之意見，聞政府與共方面之意見相當接近。</p>
<p>〔本報北平廿七日電〕有力關係觀察家稱：東北停戰協定，可能於馬歇爾飛京前簽字，彼確知蔣主席已具重大讓步決心，但謂此協定應不致動搖政府接收主權原則，至少沿東北鐵路幹綫之都市，應完全由政府接收。</p>
<p>〔本報北平廿七日電〕東北停戰協定即將在渝簽字消息傳至此間後，記者爲走訪執行部鄭委員介民，探詢眞相，鄭氏稱：截至目前，執行部尙未接到渝方有關此事之資料，但彼相信此事業有可能，因馬歇爾所提出之方案，經過長時間之深思熟慮，其中係兩方面皆可能接受者。記者又自某方探悉，政府將不放棄東北主權之接收，但在方式上則可重加考慮。</p>
<p>〔合衆社重慶廿七日電〕消息靈通方面今日加強信心謂：東北停止衝突令下週初或可頒發，至於政治協定以及軍事問題最終解決方案，將俟諸日後南京會議時商討之。</p>
<p>〔中央社重慶廿七日電〕馬歇爾特使廿七日上午十時在怡園接見民主同盟代表張瀾，羅隆基，晤談至十一時十五分：張羅二氏辭出筆，馬帥繼與中共代青恩來商談。</p>
<p>〔聨合社重庆廿七日電〕馬歇爾特使顯在盡其所能，期於移駐南京前，使國共雙方成立停戰協定，馬使今晨與周恩來會談甚久，午後赴林園，待蔣主席自成都返來後繼續談判，三人小組政府代表陳誠現在南京，雖已由政府另行派員代替，但蔣主席與馬使均願由三方最高當局直接談判，蔣主席可有全權簽署任何協定自不待言。周恩來稱：彼已受命有全權簽署「無條件停戰」協定，不必向延安請示。中共發言稱：共黨領袖相信馬使離渝赴京前，東北停戰協停有成立希望。據愁，馬使將於廿九日啓程赴京，如行前未見有停戰協定宣布，即足指出停止衝突最近將不可能，惟如馬使展期赴京，即示停戰協定尚在進行中。此間雖尙無具體表現足以證明馬使已使國共雙方即可成立新停戰協定，但重慶仍為樂覜空氣所籠罩，各方似均一致努力，期至少於還都前停止東北戰事。</p>
<h3>蓉垣昨午一席盛會　蔣主席公宴各界　對川愛護與期望情溢言表</h3>
<p>〔中央社成都廿七日電〕國府蔣土席以勝利還都離川在即，蒞蓉吿別川中父老，特於廿七日午十二時在軍校新生社公宴省垣耆宿紳學黨政軍民各機關團體領袖，社會賢達，陸空軍學校高級官長，抗戰陣亡將士遺族及在蓉外僑，到有劉豫波·邵明叔·張羣·鄧錫侯·劉文輝·黃季陸·向傳義·章嘉·李璜·吳貽芳等二四一人，濟濟一堂，爲蓉垣未有之盛會。主席於軍樂聲中步入，全體肅立致敬，主席含笑與鄰座年屆九旬之劉豫波及七十五高齡之邵明叔等握手，並向全塲點頭致意，進餐時，樂音時作，全塲空氣嚴肅而愉快。餐畢，主席起立致詞，說明四川在國民革命歷史上的光榮，四川在此次抗戰期間的地位，以及四川在今後建國時期的重要性，與四川同胞對於建國所負責任的重大，言詞剴切，聞者感動（全文整理後發表），其愛護四川之深，期望四川之切，情溢言表。語及決於最近三五年內完成成渝·成天·川滇·川黔等鐵道與川西都江大水電廠時，全體報以熱烈掌聲，歷久不息，訓詞達三十四分鐘。詞畢，掌聲復起，省參會議長向傳義代表各界民衆呈獻簽名紀念册，朗讀頌詞，並陳述民間疾苦與熱烈擁護政府建設四川之舉措，詞畢，全塲起立敬祝主席政躬康泰。繼爲劉豫波簡短致詞，旋川省主席張羣致詞，略謂：蔣主席於民國廿四年蒞川時，即以安定統一與建設爲治川三事，安定與統一，不數年而緩效大著，故軍興以來，吾川能支撑大局，肩負抗戰根據地之重任，而建設一事，則以戰時困難不易爲力，戰後主席曾指定四川爲建設實騐區，旨在加速川省建設之完成，實則十一年前主席已指示建設爲洽川三大工作之一，足徵主席對川有一貫主張。次謂：抗戰期大半在川，且曾兼理省政一年，今將還都離川，吾人固不勝依戀。主席亦謂，視四川爲其第二故鄕，此亦吾川歷史上之光榮，且將子孫世代時時懷念主席創建四川爲國家復興根據地之勳績，此後口人當禀承主席者，乃以戰時爭取勝利之精神，爭取四川建設之成功，更盼主席時時指示，各界同心協力，以無負於四川在國家地位之重要。未爲邵明叔致詞，謂全國疆土咸在主席治理之不，今雖離川還都南京，對於川民今後之訓誨與領導，固當無間於重慶南京也，此富有四川歷史意義之簾會，迄午後三時始散。</p>

<p>社論</p>
<h3>關於民主的兩年大事</h3>
<p>—國大延期召集與上海市參議員的選舉—</p>
<p>最近有兩件事，都和中國實行民主政治的前途有重大關係：第一件是本月二十五日國民政府突然下令，宣吿五月五日的國民大會延期召集，却又沒有規定延展的日期；第二件就是今天上海市公民舉行第一届市參議員的選舉投票。我們願對這兩件事提供一些意見：</p>
<p>國人望眼欲穿的國民大會，國民政府下令公吿延期舉行，雖政府具有萬分的苦心，尤其是蔣主席抱着虛懷若谷的態度，表未力圖和平解決政治僵局的決意，値得我們的崇敬，但在一般人民的心目中，誰是誰非，終究是雪亮的。人民對於蓄有梗阻國民大會的陰謀的共產黨，早比政府常局和盟邦特使馬歇爾元帥，認識它的眞面目更爲淸楚。我們就民主政洽的觀點來看，最不可解的就是：這批「民主」販子，平時吹吹打打，高唱「民主」，而何以到了國民眞要作主的時候，却偏又百端阻撓起來？</p>
<p>國民大會，早在抗戰以前就定期召集，各地代表也大都選舉出來，惟因抗戰軍興，被迫展延。那時，我們只知道共黨以及附和共黨的政客都責難政府爲什麼不早開國民大會。等到政府定了去年十一月十二日召開，其時日寇也已投降，理可如期召集。可是他們一羣「民主」販子，一方面在各地擁兵割據，一方面大呼「和平團結」，硬阻止國大的召開，甚至危言聳聽，竟好意思說出：如不先和他們商量，則召開國大於無異造成「內戰」。政府爲着爭取和平，一本政治解決的誠意，乃有政治協商會議的召集。幾經磋商，纔算共同議定，準在本年五月五日如期召集國民大會，並規定各黨派及所謂「社會賢達」的代表名額，盡量容納他們所謂「民主」黨派的意見，以求得圓滿的成果。老百姓眼巴巴的等着國民大會制憲，以爲民主政治總可望到實現了。詎知共黨一方面陰謀依附强隣，霸佔東北，播下將來第二僞滿的種子，一方面又藉口東北問題和國府委員名額爭多論少的問題，始終拉住了它的尾巴「民主同盟」，共同扼不提出國大代表名單，以爲藉此可以阻止國大的召開，要挾政府的讓步。照情理說，按法律說，政府旣一再昭吿人民，定期召集國大，且復信誓旦旦，決不再延，此際原可置之不理。但蔣主席最後還是尊重各方意見，決定暫緩召集。在政府固可稱得仁至義盡，而就民主言，究竟不是常道，不足爲訓。不過這個實任，顯然是應該由共產黨獨負其咎的。</p>
<p>民主政治之下，最應被重視的應該是人民，而不是幾個然派的政客。我們目前不能瞭解！政府當局爲什麼似乎只認識幾個黨派的「民主」販子，而竟忽略了眞正國家的主人——人民？人民盼望了近十年的國民大會，好容易要呱呱墮地了，却爲了幾個「民主」販子如簧的巧言所動，就宣吿延期。難道祗有共產黨和民主同盟這些人的意見是「民意」，而其他黨派的意見和一般人民的意見全不算是民意？難道祗有某些反政府的黨派意見應受「尊重」，而一般人民的意見可以完全漠視？不錯，人民期望和平，人民反對打仗；可是人民所最痛恨的，就是那些口唱和平而動手打仗的暴徒集團！共黨口唱和平，所以剝奪國軍的自衛欄利，只許國軍挨打，不准還手；共黨動手打仗，所以阻撓政府的接收東北，只許共黨割據，不准行政統一。而現在還有人以為政府想用「武力解決」，還有人以爲「武力解決」就沒有了民主，其實最想武力解決的就是共產黨！只要看共產黨在襲佔長春和哈爾濱以後，就高唱東北大局改觀，共黨不願再有讓步，並且强迫中央承認他們所謂「民主聯軍」和「民主政權」這一套，就可知道共黨如何迷信武力解決，如何將他們所謂「民主」寄託於他們臨時盜用敵械裝備起來的武力！國民政府如果只因爲他們有了些武力，就尊重他們的意見，以爲此乃民意，那我們眞要爲蘇北山東與東北地帶的人民呼冤，可惜他們沒有此種武力！試問那些人民眞正願意受共黨「民主政府」的統治吾？老實說，那些地方的人民，都盼國軍快去保護他們的生命，都盼中央政令的到達，眞如大旱之望雲霓，還天天在怪中央坐視他們的陷於水火之中；他們所選舉的代表也早已到京，準備出席國民大會，作正常的呼籲了，那裏希望國大緩開呢？</p>
<p>而且，上海，南京，乃至各地的國大代表，最近已紛紛主張，仍須如期在京集合，聽候中央速再定期開會。這纔是民意，這是眞正的民意。誰要民主，誰要實行民主政治，誰就得尊重這些眞正的民意。若干黨派的意見，和這些國大代表的意見，在「民主政治」這個磅秤上去衡量，無疑的應該是後者重於前者。而且，眞要杜絕中國「內戰」的爆發，也只有儘早召開國民大會，聽取眞正人民代表的呼聲，讓國民自己用主人的身份來公正的評判國是，大家動口不動手，纔是民主的正途。所以，政府儘管爲了誠心協商，而展期召集國大，以爲此可留一廻旋疏解的餘地；而照我們看法，這種背信徇情的做法，必將陷於治絲愈紊的地步。共黨在國大延期已經公告以後，就公然提出修改「政協」協議方案的要求，就是他們得寸進尺的再度表現，而延期召開國大之不能解決僵局，或反更增煩惱，可以想見，人民的眞意；決非如此期望於政府的。故我們今天有權要求政府，在所謂「黨派」以外，眞正考查人民的眞意何在；更有權要求政府，必須重視各地當選的國火代表的意見，仍在最近期間，趕快召開國民大會。這是使中國踏上民主政治的惟一大道！</p>
<p>其次，我們要說到上海市參議員的選舉。上海爲中國第一通商大埠，人口之衆多，工商之繁盛，市政之有待推進，確爲中外觀瞻所繫。此次選舉，又緊急在臨時市參義會一度開會之後，而又適當收回租界統一行政之際，正式民意機構之成立，市民自應十分重視。近日候選人競選之熱烈，似已造成民主的新風氣，未嘗不是可喜的現象。縱使有人以爲招待，茶會，宴會等等，不免有所浪費，但旣然大家要民主，則祗須沒有非法的行爲，沒有舞弊的勾當，則用種種吸引選民的方法，爲某某候選人宣傳競選，在西洋民主國家也是「家常便飯。」只要看過最近在上海開映的「威爾遜總統傳」的影片，就可窺見一斑。至於曾經親見過歐美各國競選盛况的人，自更不會少見多怪。「民主政治」，有些地方原是費錢的政治，也是廢時的政治，更是多費口舌的政治。如果心裏要民主，而一見這些事情，就以爲看不慣，這是我們的惰性，我們的積習使然；首先大家要改造我們「三顧茅廬」的舊觀念，以爲在民主選舉時代，也要坐在家裏等候登門拜請的先生纔是够格。果眞如此，則西洋民王的先進國裏，他們也不會有競選演說競選廣播這些事了。還有，聽了競選的演說或廣播，大家互相批評，互相攻擊，互相爭奪，只要不是犯了誹謗律，在他們之間喜笑怒駡也是見怪不怪的。我們目前者見幾張標語，幾張傳單，幾篇演講，幾次茶會，就街談巷議，以爲此風不可長；其實這都是不合民主時代的想法！</p>
<p>不過，我們願正吿上海全市合格的選民，今天必須人人珍重他目己應投的一張選舉票。我們聽了錢市長將親往投票所投票的消息，不但十分欣慰而興奮，並且極盼望上海所有的選民，無分男女貧富，大家憑了國民身份證的收據，鄭重親往投票，鄭重考慮他心目中的理想人物而選他出來當參議員。國民黨的訓政，就要訓練人民行使四種政權，而今天選舉市參議員，就是上海市民行使選舉權的正式開始。「作始也簡，將畢也鉅！」我們須知今天的一票，其關係不僅止於一票，乃與全上海的市政有關，更與全國民主政治的地方基礎有關。今天對地方自治的選舉可以忽略，那末將來對於中央政府的選舉更將鼓不起興味來；民主政治決不能建築其基礎於這些對政治沒有興趣沒有熱忱的人民的身上的！我們今天沒有別的話說，就只奉勸每一選民珍重他自己的選舉票。珍重自己的一票，這是民主政治的開端，也是民主政治的收功！</p>

<p>〔聨會社巴黎廿六日電〕美蘇英法西國外長今日在盧森堡宮舉行二次會議，對於義大利賠款問題，已商得商意，惟對於魯爾及奧地利問題列入議程寧，意見仍未一致。會議時首先討論義大利和約爭執各點，旋在原則上決定義大利賠款以其力能償付者為限。四國外長並已商定和約序文，聲明義大利應負戰爭禍首責任。美國原文對向義大利索取任何賠償，旋接肥蘇聨要求使義大利償付相富賠款，惟規定由專家組織委員會調査該國償付能力。蘇聯重行要求義大利應付賠款三萬萬美元，美國祇允義大利賠款不應同外國借助，專家委員會決定其償付能力時，亦不能剝奪其工廠設備，各種機器，兵工廠設挖的　及商船、。蘇聨所注意之義大利海軍則未提及。現愁，義大利如能不向美英借債而能償付賠款，則美英兩國或者亦可提出要求。</p>
<p>〔聨合社華盛頓廿六日電〕代理國務卿艾克遜今日宣稱：美蘇法四國經過一個月之談判，已允接受美國建議，將卅個月前簽訂之義大利停戰協定，予以修正，俾使停戰條件歸於緩和。</p>
<h3>安理會對西班牙問題　僵局有打開可能　蘇代表已電莫洛托夫請示　馬德里軍區取銷官兵便假</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦廿七日廣播：因弗朗朗哥問題而引起之安全理事會僵局，現已有打破之可能，蘇聯代表雖仍堅決反對調査西班牙局勢，但已電莫洛托夫請示是否可對澳法波代表之折衷建議讓步，衆料美英兩國外長將在巴黎力促莫洛托夫勿使安全理事會完全陷於僵局。</p>
<p>〔聯合社紐約廿六日電〕安全理事會今日對西班牙問題又僵持不決，現望獨持異議之蘇聯能改變態度，俾將澳洲最近提議調查西班牙弗朗哥政權一案，可獲全體一致通過。各代表對於澳代表霍奇遜兩度修正之提案，（新提案見昨日本報）顯已贊同，惟蘇聯代表葛羅朱柯不同意。葛氏昨日反對派遣任何委員會或代表團調査西班牙，謂西班牙早已成爲世界和平之威脅，毋席再加調査，果爾，則蘇聯必將堅持立塲反對新提案。</p>
<p>〔聯合社馬德里廿六日電〕據今日消息：馬德里軍區西班牙軍隊例假已一槪取消，士兵須於星期一歸營報到。官方對於此項消息，雖未加以證實，但聯合國官方則稱，此種舉動不足爲異，蓋西班牙政府曾公開表示注意法西封鎖邊境之局勢，謂該處頗有受共黨煽惑之活動云。另據某方消息：前參加對蘇作戰之「藍色師壞」司令格蘭第所部兩師團，現駐馬德里軍區，候令出動。</p>

<p>〔合衆社華盛頓廿七日電〕國會民主黨議員巴里今日稱：設美國而果往西班牙調査，則美國亦應調査蘇聯統治鐵幕後之一切國家。巴里致電史退丁紐斯謂：聯合國機構會議中一切非共黨代表，皆知唯一可能威脅世界和平之國家，並非西班牙，而實爲蘇聯。「美國人民不欲再進一步對蘇表示緩和，値茲我人尙有力要求之際，我人應於茲獲一段落。每與蘇方發現敵對之時，非成僵局，即屬蘇聯勝利，美國在世間之尊嚴，已日趨孱弱。」巴里末謂：一赤化之西班牙，將控制地中海上英國之生命綫，並得使歐洲國家中之尙未赤化者，置於莫斯科控制之下」云。</p>

<h3>蘇在德佔領區內　積極拆遷工廠　晶醚被拆者不下一百七十餘所　某廠主欲賣弄總敏連人被帶走</h3>
<p>〔聯合社柏林廿六日電〕蘇聯在德境佔領區內，繼續拆遷工廠，刻正熱烈進行。據佔領區工業管理處估計，日來被拆工廠不下一百六十至一百七十二所。薩克遜尼之華爾芬廠，曾以有色影片供應蘇聯佔領軍當局，攝取莫斯科勝利遊行片，因其成績極佳，乃立即下令將該廠機器拆卸，遷往蘇聯。梅克倫堡之紐加立斯有一造紙廠，專造高等厚紙，供證書及卷軸之用，蘇聯方面亦已訓令當地駐軍將其拆遷。廠主兼任市長，思想敏捷，即向蘇軍聲稱，本廠設備已陳舊，不如由予親往列寗格勒，爲君等另建一現代新式紙廠。蘇軍司令以此報告上峯，覆電稱：「可將其人一併帶來，稍後再建新廠。」薩克遜尼之霍區汽車廠，製造高等汽車，現正拆卸機器，預備運往蘇聯。另有蘇軍佔領區內之最大紙廠十六家正在拆卸東運，依照命令，莫森堡附近德國最大氮氣廠之設備，至五月十五日一半將在運蘇途中。據專家稱：該廠機器設備異常複雜，需兩年之久方能完全拆除。蘇聯拆遷此項工廠，當加以說明稱：波茨坦協定保證以德國西部佔領區工業設備百分之十五給與蘇聯，但欲與其他關係各國成立協定，勢難久待。其他關係各國對於何者爲「德國平時經濟所必需」，其見解顯與蘇聯不同，因此對蘇聯要求某種工廠不　讓步，將由四國專家委員會仔細審査德國工業，以決定賠償間題，此爲蘇聯急於拆遷德國工廠之另一原因，蓋一經拆遷，委員會即不能以之列入賠償計劃云。</p>
<h3>印度大會黨主席　阿柴特決定引退　推尼赫魯繼任主席　英印間談判即將重開</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社新德里廿六日電〕印度國民大會黨主席阿柴特，頃向報界談稱，余已決定引退，並推舉尼赫魯繼任主席。大會黨全國執委會凝於五月間開會，已將阿柴特主席引退事列入議程，此舉足以促成尼赫魯早日出任主席。任命印度敎人爲國民大會黨主席，意義重大，究其原因，殆因回敎徒領袖眞納不願與阿柴特往來所致。（按大會黨大半爲印度敎人所組成，自稱能代表全印人民，故於上屆選舉時，即選回敎徒阿柴特爲主席，以示大公之意）。</p>
<p>〔路透社新德里廿七日電〕英閣代表團將竭盡所能，企圖聯合印度各黨派，組織一臨時政府，俾使印度問題獲初步解決，因此於今日邀請日國民議會議長及回敎聯盟會長推舉代表，俾與英代表團賡續進行談判。</p>

<p>〔本報東京特派員廿七日專電〕昨夜自由，社會，協同及共產四黨委員會舉行會議，討論組織聯合政府，當時爭論達兩小時之久，毫無結果，因社會黨仍欲在新閣中佔得首相一職，而自由黨則堅決反對。今日下午一時，社會黨領袖片山訪自由黨領袖鳩山，再度討論達一小時二十分鐘之久，旋即召開記者招待會，承認談判宣吿失敗。各黨領袖明最將訪幣原商討一切，日內閣如此難產，此尙爲第一次。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社東京廿七日電〕日本進步黨領袖中井談稱，自由黨與社會黨合作旣不可能，則幣原捲土重來之機會大爲增加。言時面露笑容。</p>

<h3>國際銀行將於半年內　發行第一次公債　可能在國外商業中心區買賣</h3>
<p>〔聯合社紐的廿六日電〕國際復興開發銀行或將於六個月內，發行第一次公債，預料購者必甚踴躍。國際銀行公債雖大異於普通一般公債，但亦將向證券滙兌委會登記。紐約各儲蓄銀行及信托公司獲許可，准以此項公債作爲投資。參加國際銀行國家計共卅八國，惟各國所認金額未能立即繳齊，因在各國所認總數九十一萬萬元中，每次收集數額不能超過此數百分之二十，以故該行必需發行公債，藉以獲得所需資金，協助遭受戰禍國家從事復興工作。據證券滙兌委會國外投資顧問羅柴姆談稱，國際銀行公債可能在證券交易所及其他國外商業中心區買賣，預料該行將先發行每張一萬萬元數額較小之債票，以試購買情形如何，然後再發行巨額債票。</p>

<h3>在紐約街頭看美國復員（下）</h3>
<p>— 丁報駐美特約記者　毛樹淸</p>
<p>我問過一位市政府的新認識的朋友，是不是因爲軍人都退伍回來了，紐的才缺房子？他說，多少有點關係，但是也不盡然。「退伍軍人，多半是按原址送回家鄉的」，並沒有留在紐的。「而且有一部份，分別進了全國各大學」！</p>
<p>根據美國軍人的權利請願書，軍人退伍，而自願入學深造者，政府有達成其願望的責任。因之，全美各大學，現在都在鬧學生太多，容量不敷的問題。紐的哥侖比亞大學附近，還可以看見軍服沒有褪下，捧着書本走路的大學生，而且有許多寄住在校內的宿舍。俄亥俄州立大學，最近分發到了二百個殘廢榮譽軍人入學，他們住宿在陸軍醫院裏，白天按時去學校上課。其中有一個，而腿都折斷了的。他們都沒法上操，或參與學校各種活動。級的時報最近發出呼聲，認爲軍人大量湧入學校，會增加敎育行政的困難，要復員當局設法改善。</p>
<p>一千多萬壯丁復員，木來不是一件容易的事。轉輾歐陸的布累特勞將軍，出任復員工作的首長以後，正在大刀闊斧的排除一切障礙做着，看紐的一般的情形，復員回來，流浪失業的絕對很少。當我在大西洋船上的旅途中，參加他們官兵的娛樂，復員當局用電影發出通知，要他們怎樣塡志願表，分發或介紹工作。美國政府上下都下了大決心在做，他們認爲：如果這件事情辦不好，將是全國共同釣恥辱。</p>
<p>在美國，失業和工潮，是兩回事，失業問題如果嚴重了，會釀成社會的不安。工人罷工，雖同樣會減低生產，但在資本主義高度成熟的國家，「工潮」是常有的事，特別是戰爭剛剛結東以後。美國有許多礦廠，戰前每天工作五小時，戰時增加生產，都增加到八小時，工資常然也跟着增加。現在戰爭結束了，每天又要回復到五小時工作，工人們希望不減工資，甚或增加工資，因爲一般物價，都比從前增高了，大部分的礦廠主人，都同意增加工資，不過彼此之間有距離，就成爲工潮的泉源。同時，美國的工潮，決不是暴動，他們有民主的訓練，有強有力的集體組織，最有力量的，例如全國職工聯合會C.I.O.等等。最近工聯的主席路易斯，在華盛頓有一篇對工人的演講，特別抨擊工會「政黨化」，他說，美國的工聯，是沒有政黨性的，決不做任何政黨的尾巴。「有人把我們目爲共產黨的贊助者，那是大大的錯誤」。</p>
<p>最近美國的煤礦工潮，正在展開，佛傑尼亞，賓夕法尼亞·肯塔基·凱撤斯各州的「軟煤」工人的四十萬人，都已經停止工作，靜候他們工聯會對炎方的談判。談判在華盛頓舉行，煤工聯合會的要求是：（一）增加礦塲安全設備：（二）礦方應以每噸煤一角的數額，撥充工人福利基金；（三）每星期五十四小時工作制，改爲三十五小時，並不减低薪水。要求提出以後，政府派遺保羅·福爾出任仲裁。資方認爲：第一點的問題，可以請最高等的工程師技術專家，隨時監査改良。館二點如果實行，每年資方的損失，將達六千萬美元，數目未免太火。第三點工作時間，可以考慮。</p>
<p>煤是日用必需品，也是重工業的主要燃料，因之，煤生產的停滯，會牽一髮而動全局。據紐的時報的估計，目前紐的及附近存煤，尙足敷四星期至六星期之用，但鋼鐵工業，影響甚大。匹茨堡最大的一家鋼鐵公司，預備减去百分之四十七的生產量，以應付燃料缺乏的局面。</p>
<p>我舉煤礦的情形爲例，說明美國現在許多輕重工業，都在戰爭到和平的過渡期中脫了節。這是難免的現象，像這樣一個龐大的國家，在太平洋，在歐洲，動員到一千多萬人，幾千萬噸物資去作戰，一旦復員，決不是一件容易的事。說起來，也許更不能令人相信的，那便是：紐約市上，到現在還買不到牛油和白糖。我在歐洲各地的美國兵營中，看見美國運去的黃油，堆如山積，但是，到了紐約，吃館子，沒有牛油，「美國人不是祇知道享福的民族」，他們爲戰爭，曾經犧牲了一切。</p>
<p>當然，無論從那一方面去看，美國人還是全世界最快樂的一羣，他們跳跳，呌呌，閙閙，沒有憂愁，沒有煩惱。特別在紐的，五家世界最大的電影院，音樂大厦，國會，露克賽，每天出入好幾萬人，從一大早到深夜，禮拜六和禮拜天，甚至二十四小時通宵。好萊塢一張新片到了紐的，買票就要排隊。一塊多美金，看了電影，又看了歌舞。絲的這幾百萬人，好像玩的時候多，工作的時間少。這種享樂的情形，在歐洲是看不到找不到的。有一次，露克賽戲院，放映新聞片，前任紐的市長賴伽第亞，出任救濟善後總署的署長。他的照片出現了，臺下這些「紐約人」，都喧笑起來，賴伽第亞的就職演講，每講一句，臺下必哄堂大笑一次，正彷彿中學生看見自己的級任導師，上臺演戲一樣。賴伽第亞曾經當過他們七百萬人的家長，也曾經當過他們的級任導師。誰說民主政治不可愛？民主政治的可愛，就在這裏。（完）（四月十日航寄）</p>

<h3>選賢與能踴躍參加　愼軍將事合法選舉　　錢市長選舉前夕廣播</h3>
<p>錢市長大鈞，昨晚廣播演說，向全市各界同胞表示對於這次選舉的期望三點：（一）要作一個民主國家的國民，第一個條件就是要熱心政治，而熱心政治的主要表現，就是熱烈參加選舉，參加選舉是每一個國民應盡的義務，起碼的義務，必須每個國民都樂於祖任這個義務，我們才能成爲眞正民主的國家。（二）我們參加選舉，不僅是馬馬虎虎投了一票便算完事，我們還要對於人選愼重考慮之後，才寫上他的姓名。古人說「大道之行」要靠「選賢任能」，賢者就是有道德的人，能者就是有能力的人，必須道德與能力兼備，才配作我們的代表。選舉是義務也是權利，我們不要放棄這種權利，也不要隨便使用這種權利。（三）民主政治與法律有着不可分離的關係，離開了法治，我們不能有民治。在選舉的時候，大家雖然都應當熱烈地競選，可是一切行動，都要合法，不可有軌外的行動，用軌外的方法來競選，不但要受到法律的制裁，不但沒有效果，而且即使倖而獲選，也是不名譽的勝利，不光榮的勝利。本人在這選舉的前夕，期望各界同胞的努力，同時並預祝我們第一届市參議員選舉的圓滿和成功。</p>
<h3>姜公美案三日後事望宣判　宵標暫不解除　李總司令出席記者招待會報告</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕淞滬警備司令部總司令李及蘭，昨日下午三時出席市府新聞處記者招待會，報吿及答覆本市治安問題。關於宵禁未能解除原因，李司令申述目前營力尙未充實，交通猶未恢復，市區盜竊案層出不窮。爲整個市民生命財產安全起見，暫時尙不能解除，尤以五月間爲多事之秋，應宜加緊防範，惟對少數人夜間工作，已給予種種便利。</p>
<p>姜公義案，警備司令部於去年十月十三日將其拘捕，全部案件則交重慶憲兵總司令部，後請示軍事委員會最高常局後，命令由警備司令部審訊。當即由該部與陸軍總部，憲兵司令部派員會審，審訊完畢後，主審官陸軍總部高參李申之將姜宣判無罪，各界及錢總司令均認爲此項宣判不妥，故再請示當局，奉令覆審，並將人犯回押，此案三日以後可望判決，宣判後仍將請示軍委會覆核。</p>
<p>本市時有盜案發生及軍人搶刦等情，李司令稱，當盡全力處置，査實後，決處重刑。但不免有若干假冒軍人，以陰謀手段，破壞中央及嫁禍於中央機關，使市民發生疑間，亦意料中事；另有逃兵雜兵等，危害地方治安，査到後必依法嚴辦。軍警被派守虹口一帶房屋，如有浪費居戶水電致增加負担，可報吿調査，予以處罰。</p>

<h3>公審兩為官　謝仲復共為生活所迫　徐季敦竟說幫助抗戰</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕謝仲復·徐季敦，昨日上午在高院先後由邱煥瀛推事提訊。兩被告前者矮胖，剃平頂頭，衣藍布長袍，後者闅長，蓄髮，衣畏條夾袍。其家屬皆代爲請有律師辯護。</p>
<p>謝仲復</p>
<p>供稱：四十九歲，廣東梅縣人，民國廿五年以前任僑務委員會委員，廿五年下半年辭職。至參加僞組織，始自廿九年四月。係由褚民誼介紹，担任僞僑務委員會常務委員。主任委員爲陳濟成。但當時偽政令不能出國門，故該會根本無事可做。平時很少開會，逢開亦祇討論人事問題。故該職等於尸位素餐。至卅二年二月，該會遂與僞邊疆委員會同時撤裁。卅三年八月改任僞行政督察專員，該職亦無實際工作。且當時淸鄕工作已吿結束，故未預聞。卅四年五月，又隨丁默邨赴浙任僞敎育廳長，未三月即勝利。被吿在各項僞職任內，始終未有發表任何談話，廣播演講，撰述論文及有與海外通訊等事。至出任僞職，係因當時經濟困難，上有老父，下有七八口之家累，亦生活逼迫所致。今被囚獄中，血壓甚高，又患重聽，故請庭上明察，宣吿無罪。言時淚含於睫，黯然不能成語。</p>
<p>徐季敦</p>
<p>五十歲，高郵人。據供：廿八年前在省立揚州中學服務。後因與當時江蘇敎育廳長馬元放之部下籌備出版刋物事，爲「七十六號」所捕，被脅迫參加僞組織。但僞普通敎育司爲專轄中小學敎育之機關。制定敎科書事，另有編審室主其事。被吿曾建議當時僞敎育部長趙政平，將維新政府時代變更學制，聘有日顧問，不講三民主義，不掛總理遺像，將公民課改爲修身課諸點，予以糾正。關於加授日語事，當時曾商定「小學以不敎外國語」爲原則。至在浙敎育廳長任內辦理淸鄕敎育事，淸鄕爲一名目，其實亦爲食通政治。在上海偽建設局長任內，水電係由敵華中水電公司管理，故除車輛登記事外，別無他事。至修復上川上南兩輕便鐵道，全係便利商民運貨來往，並非供敵作軍用。而被吿於任內努力减少文盲，安定敎員生活，恢復學校，掩護敎員學生往來大後方等工作，皆爲有益於民衆之事，可請庭上調査云。審訊中途，邱推事曾突然詢問被吿對於南京政府是否贊成？徐爲之滯呆多時，呑吐不能成語。最後始答：表面看來好像都有一番道理，究竟是功是過，我不敢論定。而本人參加之意，亦祇想能做一點事，間接帮助抗戰而已。庭論以上兩案，改期再訊，被吿還押。</p>

<h3>華茶外銷三大障礙　成本過高勢必無人問津　須以集體力量聨合經營</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕茲承中國茶葉協會理事長壽毅成氏吿記者稱：目前華茶出口貿易，有三大障碍：（一）價格問題，目前茶農計算茶價，均以米價爲標準。設糧價高，而茶價低，茶農以無利可岡，將不摘茶葉。故無形中米價與茶價，已發生聯繫作用。（二）運費問題，國內運輸困難，運價高昂。（三）利率問題，目前國內利率高翔，即以最近成立之東南產茶區之茶貸而言，亦須月息四分半，再加手續費一分半，共爲月息六分。而戰前茶貸，則僅年息七厘至八厘。以最近日本之情形而言，亦僅年息二厘。此次茶貸，浙皖贛三省，共達七十億元。此於恢復戰後農村經濟，厥功殊偉。按預定計劃，本年內浙江省之平水區可產茶十六萬箱；遂淳區可產茶三萬五千箱；溫州區可產茶二萬箱。安徽省之屯溪區可產茶十二萬箱；祁門區可產茶七萬五千箱。江西省之寗州區可產茶四萬箱，贛東區可產茶一萬箱。此外福建全省約可產茶十四萬箱；湖南湖北兩省約可產茶的三十萬箱；以上共計約九十萬箱。惟旣有產量，務必進一步準備其外銷步驟。以目前世界茶葉產銷情形觀之，日本產茶，因戰事影響，已較戰前减縮五成，而我國則不過三成，實爲急起直追之良機。又美國原與英國訂有購買印度錫蘭茶葉之商的，現已宣佈不再續訂，因此美人深望能多購華茶。且此次戰事，美軍足跡遍歷華印及菲律賓等地者，多至六百萬人以上。此批兵士以缺乏咖啡飲料，已習慣飲茶。返美後盛贊華茶之優美，爲我國紅綠茶，作義務之宣傳，故我國紅綠茶在美不愁無銷塲。惟過去我國綠茶最大市塲爲北菲洲，祁門紅茶最大市塲爲英倫，茶磚則多銷蘇俄；在抗戰初期，華茶百分之七十，均係運俄易貨。故外銷方面，應有精密計劃，整齊步驟，以圖久遠。而减輕生產成本，允屬首要。例如祁門紅茶之美國市價，每磅不過美金五角。最近雖漲至五角七分，而我國祁門紅茶銷美成本，每磅至少須美金一元左右，相差達一倍之鉅。故即使各國有意承購，亦將因價高而乏人問津。壽氏認爲减低生產成本，第一須聯合國內各茶商，組織中國茶葉出口貿易聯營公司；以集體力量，同一步驟，聯合經營，集中運銷。一方面延攬專才，購買新機器，以科學化方法，設實騐農園，及精製茶廠，以便大規模生產精良茶葉。一方面更望政府對全國茶業，有一不變之國策。使茶商茶農，於產銷方面，俱有所遵循，而向健全及有計劃之生產途徑邁進。</p>
<h3>五月一日起　電話累進收費　希望市民節制使用</h3>
<p>美商上海電話公司，因限於設備，對於市民裝置電話，不但未能普遍供應，其日常接綫，亦因話務之擁擠，而感遲緩。公用局有鑒於此，已迭次指示改進辦法，一面督促該公司將現有機件作適宜調度，幷責其迅速向美訂購機件，以備擴充。聞足敷一萬用戶綫之設備，已在訂購中。惟値茲世界各國均感物質缺乏聲中，此項計劃，難望於短斯內完成，而目前該公司用戶，使用電話異常繁忙，計每日每綫通話一〇·六次，已超過機器容量百分之四十。在擴充機件未能實現期間，該公司爲促進接綫速度，呈請採用累進收費制，業經公用局縝密硏究，參酌該公司收支狀况，根據用戶正常需要，幷顧及一般市民負擔，核定累進辦法，呈奉市政府核准，於五月一日起施行。基本話費僅增加百分之七十至一百，其超過基本次數，則以每一百次爲一級，累進收費。計每月通話在一百次以下者，每次收費廿五元；一〇一次至二百次每次五十元；二〇一次至三百次每次一百元；三〇一次至四百次每次一百五十元；超過四百次者每次二百元。甚希本市市民節减不必要之通話，使機件負擔减輕，不但話務可期暢達，且可有餘量以供市民之正常申請，如是紫話服務效率，行見逐漸改進云。</p>

<h3>江常通海塘危急　旅滬同鄕謀搶救</h3>
<p>江陰·常熟·南通·三縣管轄之常陰沙，濱臨大江，淪陷八年，海塘工程損失不堪。際此春水已漲，夏潮將至之時，沿江一帶，頗有陸沉之虞，數萬災民，　惶不可終日。乃於日前推派代表來滬，向各界呼籲救濟，經該三縣旅滬同鄕發起組織江常通海塘工程委員會，籌劃搶救，假座大西洋菜社舉行成立大會。推繼陳石泉。馮有俱。吳漱英。等九人為常務委員，主持會務，積　進行。據專家估計，全部工程需款三十五億元之多。</p>
<h3>空中遊覧掠影　西子湖上小勾留</h3>
<p>— 本報記者　邁天·瘦木</p>
<p>記得抗戰前，歐亞航空公司曾經招待過新聞界作環市飛行，但從沒有像昨天中央航空運輸公司的招待，那末地偉大和興奮—將我們從上海經太湖送到了西子湖，再由西子湖送回來。這一段空中旅行，尤其在暮春的季節，大江南一片春光，正不敎人神往呢。</p>
<p>昨晨八時半，記者快到達市府門前，預備等候航空公司卡車接往機塲時，滿以爲又有什麼團愷在請願，結果一看，那一大堆的人，原來都是打算「飛」的。每個簽過名的記者，還可以帶一個朋友，難怪大家爭着要搶個機會了，弄得發票的那位先生，逃東逃西，跳上跳下，滿頭大汗。結果費了三個鐘點，才算把票發淸楚。</p>
<p>一百幾十個人按次序分成三批遊覽。第一批的人，在九時四十分坐着該公司可載重的六噸的第十九號C46型草黃色運輸機，自龍華出發。由機航組組長陳文寬君，親自駕駛。旁邊坐着一位外國助手，他能說很流利的國語。陳君駕駛的技術，非常高明，據說他在緬何一帶作戰時，載運軍火及物資，每天來回有六次之多，這種艱苦耐勞的工作，確不容易。</p>
<p>飛機上升後，在市區繞了一週，就沿京滬綫飛行，到達太湖僅二十分鐘，從太湖到西湖，因爲氣候轉劣，所以機身振盪起來，忽高忽低，同坐中有不少人都嘔吐起來，在雲層裏飛了約十五分鐘，機身慢慢下降，這時已到了西湖上空，隱約中已欣賞着西子美景，總算不辜負此行。</p>
<p>第一批回上海時爲十一點廿分。十分鐘後，第二批接着乘原機高飛，可是這回有些吃虧了，祇能在上海附近飛一圈，但從機內鳥瞰這東方第一大都市，水田分明，十分美觀，房屋建築排得好像很整齊，而原野間一片碧田，更美麗而可愛。黃浦江中大兵艦，這時已成爲一隻隻鞋子；火車行動時和地上的蚯蚓毫無兩樣。機中放着氧氣，飛了四十分鐘，大家都漸漸熱起來了。有幾個客人已支持不住，回來也該休息休息了吧。</p>
<p>第三批的人熱忱始終未减，已近吃中飯的時候，還是想上去，於蠅另外換了一機，經過大家一致要求，飛機師不願掃興，終於在杭州上空繞了一圈，把大家帶回來時，已二點過了。</p>
<h3>陳陶遺氏逝世　宣傳革命數十年如一日　堅貞自持盡瘁服務地方</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕金山陳陶遺氏，〔見圖〕年六十六，於昨日上午十一時半在其滬寓赫德路擇隣處十二號逝世。當噩耗傳出後，凡陳氏生前友好，莫不同聲哀悼。現定明日下午四時，在世界殯儀館大殮。陳氏係前淸末科才秀，革命風起，即變賣家產，赴日本早稻田大學攻讀政治經濟，並加入同盟會。旋暗殺團成立，陳氏任副團長，奉派返國工作。事機不密，於船抵吳淞口時，被兩江總督端方下令上海道扣押解京。幸經張賽力保，始於辛亥革命前一年獲釋。即赴南洋各地宣傳革命，並任國民黨江蘇支部長。選舉大總統時，任江蘇代表，曁臨時參議會副議長。二次革命失敗後，擺脫黨政事務，赴東三省組織東井公司，從事墾荒。孫傳芳任五省總督時，震於陳氏聲望，一再邀請，出長蘇省。北伐時，現任川省主席張羣，奉命與陳氏接洽，勸孫反正，卒因參謀長阻撓，未達目的。陳氏乃亦借此退休，返歸田園。陳民與本報故主人史量才氏係摯友，故對本報，凡力之所及，無不盡力爲之。其後史氏出長本市地方協會時，陳氏出任秘書長。本市淪陷期內，在逆亦曾數度邀其出畏蘇省，均經託病辭謝。陳氏常對其公子端白，修白，曰：但願得一清白之軀足矣，富貴非我等所欲求也。陳氏於十年前即染有肺結核，惟經其長公子悉心治療，已漸復健康，至前年復得氣管擴大症，致氣喘不止。最近心臟衰弱，血液循環亦不正常。本月十五日起，呼吸短促，至前日血壓降低，血管出血。延至昨日上午十一時半，溘然長逝。</p>
<h3>三奸判徒刑　四案辯論終結</h3>

<h3>尙賢婦孺醫院　積極恢復業務</h3>
<p>尙賢婦孺醫院爲一般貧苦婦孺服務，二十年來，功績斐然。向賃杜美路十一號房屋作爲院址，奈抗戰勝利後，該慶爲業主收回，只得進出，但以病人眾多，診　工作不能休頓，仍設門診部於英士路十二號，住院病人則暫借住人和醫院。嗣有基督敎鴻德堂，願以堂屋借與該院。惜以修理費過鉅，未能成爲事實。茲又有英人華德君願以自產塘沽路沿馬路房屋數幢，無條件租與該院，熱心堪佩。聞該院董事會將積極募款，加以修葺，俾得早日恢復院務。</p>

<h3>單槍匹馬應付內外局勢　杜魯門職繁權重</h3>
<p>「曾經做過美國大總統的人，對他朋友中間有人中選大總統的時候，他決不會再伸手向他這個朋友道一聲恭喜！」</p>
<p>上面這句話是北美合衆國第二任大總統約翰·亞達姆斯（JohnAdams）說的；其時正當他的兒子崑出亞達姆斯Quincy　Adams也當選爲美國總統。此事離開現在已經有一百多年了。從那時起，一直到現在二十世紀，這美國的大總統，始終就成爲世上事務最冗繁，責任最重大的一種職位。</p>
<p>杜魯門　近影</p>
<p>職權重大　世罕其匹</p>
<p>美國這强大的國家，擁有全人口乙億四千萬。她的最後的行動責任，便落在大總統的肩膀上，美國和世上其他國家往來關係的最後責任，也歸大總統負担。他（大總統）是政府的元首，他有權領導他所隸屬的政黨，並解決國內的危機紛爭。他負責處理外交事務，那便是說，國外的事務也歸他來決斷。他有大小一切公務員的任命權。他所以能完成這些重大的使命任務，完全依靠一種世上各國元首很少賦有的大總統權威所致。</p>
<p>勉力周旋　艱鉅異常</p>
<p>事實上，美大總統的行動，並不向自己負責。他的行動，祇須得到參衆任何一議院的通過，便可成立法律根據，這一點和其他的共和國家相反，也可說是不同的。美國歷史上有若干大總統在任時，參衆兩議院內充斥反對黨所佔有的議席換一句說，便是總統必須在站於敵對地位的兩院鉗持下去處理政務和統治國家。故羅斯福總統（按美國的羅斯福總統一共有兩位，系出一門，可是先後有別，老羅斯福名叫琇奧道爾羅斯福（Theodore　Rooseveit）這裏所說的是迎任四屆，爲世界和平，人類幸福奮鬥而有豐功偉績的弗蘭克林羅斯福。（Frankln　D.Roosevelt）富初美國獨立時第乙任大總統華盛頓在任時，規定總統不得連任兩屆以上，此舉是預防一人獨裁和符合民主原則的一種良好傳統習慣，上次羅斯福總統的一連再連，完全是美國歷史上的例外，所以也由此足見他功績和深得民心的一斑了。）前一任的大總統胡佛，便是一例。胡佛總統是共和黨員，在他出任總統後的兩年內，參衆兩院內的議席，大多數屬諸民主黨，他不得不和擁有大多數敵對派的兩院勉力去週旋，情形是相當棘手的？</p>
<p>由於彈劾　中途去職</p>
<p>美國大總統可因「彈劾」（lmpeachment）而去聨，所謂一彈劾」，是開始於衆議院議員們對於叛國大逆罪，舞弊營私，和其他大罪的一種控訴程序。參議院根據憲法賦予的權力，有權把這衆議院所提出的彈劾案件付以表決，但必須獲得全體議員三分之二大多數之同意，方可成立懲戒案或撤職案。可是這種彈劾程序，在美國歷史上，祇運用過一次，那是一八六八年，詹森任總統的時候。詹森因參衆兩院的彈劾，而中途去職，他犯的不是叛國大逆或營私舞弊等罪，去職的原因，是他未得參議院的同意，而擅陸軍將部長撤職所致。</p>
<p>十位部長　形同配角</p>
<p>大總統權限中最重要的一種，是他的吾決權。美國國會所剏議的法律，他有權可以吾決，那便是表示不贊成，不同意，而不予通過實施的權力。經過大總統吾決之後，兩院便需第二次再以三分之二的大多數，重付表決，法律始可合法地成立。帮助總統處理政府要務的，一共有十個部長，他們共同被任命爲他的內閣，</p>
<p>如他的班底配角一般。十部的名稱是：國務院，（略等於別國的外交部，可是責權大得多，故稱院，長官稱國務卿，此地姑且也歸入十部之內）財政部，陸軍部，司法部，郵政部，海軍部，內政部，農業部，商務部和勞工部。</p>
<p>年入三千　不如商人</p>
<p>任期共四年，待遇是年俸七萬五千元。過去有好幾個總統在任時都負債纍纍。有一次，故羅斯福總統的新聞秘書達尼爾斯曾把總統個人的收入加以估計，他說：除付掉各項所得等稅，和白宮內的一切開支以後，總統自己和他的家庭，每年祇可拿到三千塊美金！話雖如此，大總統的職位，始終還是美國大政洽家們拼命鑽營角逐的一個高位啊！美國總統並非由直接選舉所產生。選舉方式是這樣的：每一州的民主共和兩黨（按美國事實上握有政權的祗有這兩大黨，歷屆總統都不出這兩黨候選人的範圍以外，這次大戰期間和其後，雖有其他黨派出現，畢竟還無甚影響）在參衆兩院內有多少議員席，各該州內的選舉人數也便相等於這個數目。兩黨選舉人必須集體推出黨內的總統候選人。結果得票最多的便中選爲大總統。在這一制度下，假使對方競選者在各州選舉中獲有大多數票，一個在直接選舉中得票數最多的候選人，可能會筱對方打倒，此事頗有數學化式的可能性。</p>
<p>青春卅五　總統可做</p>
<p>大多數國家的總統，都是從國會或議會內遴選出來的。可是美國的總統並不如此產生，所以又有一種危險的可能。那便是中選的總統，不一定是豐富於政治經騐的人。一九四〇年競選總統時敗北的威爾基氏，（Wilkie）或許就是一件明顯的例子。威氏在參加總統競選之前，從來沒有担任過公職。再舉一個例十，如果一個軍人中選總統，那末，除掉在軍隊裏得到的經騐之外，恐怕便沒有多大旁的重大經騐罷？這些都是某法國記者批評的說法。候選人至少要有三十五歲，方可參加競選，此外還須養在美國，和住在美國至少有十四年以上等條　。上面已經說過，羅斯福之前，美國大總統至多祇能連任一次。羅斯福不單述任二次，一九四四年起，簡直連任三次，他前後一共做了四任大總統，可以說一句「空前」，或許也竟「絕後」！</p>
<p>單槍匹馬　應付世局</p>
<p>一九四五年四月間羅斯福總統逝世後，按照美國的憲法，副總統杜魯門是當然的承繼者。美國憲法內有一句條文規定說：「大總統死亡出缺時，由副總統繼承之，如副總統再行出缺，則由各部部長，首自國務卿起，繼任副總統之後。」副總統的主要任務，是担任參議院的主席。副總統的選舉運動，例在大總統選舉之前舉行。同時副總統往往是因政治上的理由而選出的。如果副總統繼承爲大總統，國內被再沒有副總統這一席，一直要維持到下屆總統競選時爲止。所以目前的杜魯門大總統，手下並沒有副總統，豈非等於單槍匹馬，在應付紛繁多樣的世界局勢嗎？（幼琴）</p>
<h3>公審為滿駐德公使　呂逆宜文</h3>
<p>— 本報廿一日航訊　昆明特派員張生力寄</p>
<p>翻閱邇來各報所載審奸供詞，自稱無國籍的漢奸，也許以呂逆宜文爲第一人。呂逆曾在偽滿「康德皇帝陛下」，當過國務總理的秘書官長，外交部通商司長，第一任通化省長，和首任駐德公使，這樣一個僞銜不小，派頭頗足的漢奸，在歌舞昇平的昆明公審，自然足以引起一般市民的注意。</p>
<p>對着法官演講　表示「曲綫愛國」</p>
<p>四月二十日下午二時，雲南省高等法院門庭前，消失了日常的冷落狀態，爭先恐後的市民，肩摩踵接的擠入刑庭，遲到的觀衆，理直氣壯的爬上窗台，撕碎窗紙，咸以光覩漢奸面目爲快。呂逆着灰色花呢西服，戴金絲無邊眼鏡，着德國式皮鞋，稍形斑白的頭髮上，擦着一層髮油，押解到庭時，觀衆私語曰：「你看那仁丹式的鬍子，就是漢奸的象徵！」</p>
<p>推事韓雲鵠，首先訊問呂逆的籍貫，呂逆供稱：「關東金縣人，但是沒有中國籍，因爲甲午戰後，遼東半島的中國人，便失了國籍。」推事繼按公訴書逐一訊問，呂逆即以熟練詭辯技巧，曲陳其「愛國」，「愛民」，「愛家」的經過，並謂：「宜文不善詞令，嗓子不好。」有時以手勢補助語氣，似乎在對沉着的法官講演。除表示「曲綫愛國」外，還自認是一名「孝子」。</p>
<p>呂逆娓妮諉稱　未行毒化政策</p>
<p>據呂逆供稱：九一八事變前，曾失業兩年，後來才在東北航空司令部充任日文翻譯官。東北軍調進關內時，上峯未准其入關，即赴大述。呂逆裝作感慨的口吻說：「當時國家無能爲力，我又有什麽辦法？」二十一年三月，呂逆任僞滿通商司長，他的供詞是：「那是有名無實的司長，什麽事也沒有做，因爲根本與國際間無通商關係。」並自認在司畏任內，未與日本簽訂通商條約，亦未帮助日人掠奪物資。觀衆聽到這衷，咸報以冷笑。</p>
<p>韓推事問：「你是否推行過僞滿毒化政策？」呂逆娓娓供稱：「沒有，沒有，我敢說沒有。法官可以想像，通化省九縣，人民連飯都沒有喫，那裏還吸得起毒品？我在通化省長任內，朝鮮總督曾下令購地移民，我誓死反對，致使日人不滿。至於抽收壯丁，那是宜文到德國以後的事，宜文回法官的話，請法官到東北調査，最好請將本案移轉東北法院審判，假如有這些事，宜文就會自殺。」</p>
<p>搖頭擺尾詭辯　堆砌漂亮名詞</p>
<p>此時，呂逆詭辯得搖頭擺尾，什麼「救濟難民，貸放種籽，」什麼「悲天憫人，拯民於水火之中，」一連串的漂亮名詞，使觀衆感到刺耳，可是他的「豐功偉績，」還不只此，他說：「金州一百萬人，就靠他與僞滿拼命，才能够活下來。」至此，他更舉一例，進一解曰：「東北如皮，金州如毛，宜文若不救東北，毛將安附？」「比如說：金州的奶妓，從未接過一個日本人。」最後，他以不勝感慨的表情，結束東北部份的供詞：「抗戰現已勝利，金州經過日俄兩帝國的侵略後，復歸祖國，宜文死也甘心！」</p>
<p>曾與希魔會晤　怕見陳介大使</p>
<p>二十七年，德國承認僞滿，互換使節，呂逆即任駐德公使。據供稱：曾以不通德文，請辭未遂，乃於是年十一月一日，由大連啓程前往。是月二十一日向德政府呈遞國書，曾與希魔會晤，並曾在一茶會上，會見我國駐德大使陳介，惟以不好意思，未與陳大使談話。法官訊及公使館的人事組織與工作時，呂逆稱：僅有華籍職負兩名，餘均爲日人，使館的情報工作，係搜集歐洲經濟及新聞資料，未曾收集軍事政治情報供給僞滿，並稱一切行動均不自由，「我如果不做混蛋，他們就不會放我？」繼即供述其被俘經過，末稱：「此次重返祖國，深感光榮，服務僞滿，係出於誤會。」（簡單的審訊，和喋喋不休的詭辯，直至三時四十分，韓推事始宣吿特種調査庭結束。本月二十五日開庭辯論，呂逆低頭走出法庭時，一個旁聽的老太婆說：「當漢奸也是誤會，眞是怪咯！」（四月廿一日寄自昆明）</p>

<h3>人民的「健康權」　憲法中急應增列的一項</h3>
<p>— 劉冠生</p>
<p>本年三月間，英國宣布衛生法案，所有醫院均將變爲國立，全國人民一筆免費醫治疾病。此法案的目的，表示國家準備與疾病作戰，以維護人民享有「健康權」。這是現時代最重要社會文件之一。這法案和國家保險法及工業損傷法，形成了「新英國決心建造的社會安全大厦的三根根柱石。」</p>
<p>本年四月八日重慶中央日報又載有法國新人權宣言，這是第四共和新修正的憲法草案中人民權利章。該宣方第二十二條「國民健康與孕婦之保護，體育之發展，公共衛生以及由科學而來之各種措施，國家保證全民皆能事受。」其宣言前言，並載有「法國人民宣稱，凡人皆有神聖不可讓予且爲不能被任何法律侵犯之權利，並決定將該項權利列於憲法之首」文句。</p>
<p>這連續兩則使人驚震的報導，使我們忝居五强之一的中國人民，聆悉之餘，眞不知何措手足？是欣羨哩？還是愧赧？是乞求哩？還是爭取？値此驚欣之餘，願略表所見，就正賢達。</p>
<p>「健康權」列為人民的基本權利，和身體，居住，信仰，言論集會結社……等權利同等重要，這是近士幾年社會思想進步的產物，也是人類對於本身地位的一個新發現。因為近代思潮認為人們都有生存的權利，不僅應生存，且須康健愉快的生存。若是不能維護並增進其健康的話，已失其生存的重要意義。第一次用成文的方法承認人們有「休息權」，政府並保證其實施，設有各項療養院醫療所等設備，這是在蘇聯憲法中規定過（蘇憲第二九條及第三〇條）這是和工作權教育權，一同被譽爲蘇聯憲法的特點，也是「健康權」的濫觴。</p>
<p>自第二次世界大戰以來，全世界具有先見的人們，更確認「健康是人生最大的財富」，「國民的健康是國家最實貴的資源」，所以無論從個人說，從國家說，人民「健康」的維護與增進，是無庸疑義的一件事，而且是國家不容却卸棄的責任。換句話說，也就是人民最神聖的一種權利。所以大西洋憲章中提出四大自由，其中有「免於匱乏之自由」一項。一九四三年美國前副總統華萊士講演戰後和平步驟時，即謂：「免於匱乏之自由」，應爲新自由宣言之精髓。此種自由，可闡明爲七項，其中第三項爲「免於不必要之憂慮疾病與饑餓之自由」，此爲美國對於「健康」之首倡。</p>
<p>一九四三年美國羅斯福總統致國會咨文中，提出確定人民第二權利八點，其中第六點爲：「有獲得適當醫藥並享受健康之權」，第七點為：「於老老疾病災難及失業的經濟困難的擺脫，有獲得適當保障之權」，第五點爲：「每一家庭有適當住宅之權」；第二點爲：「有獲得充分糧食衣服及再生產之權」。關於衣·食·住·醫藥等均列入爲人民權利。是以無論是積極或消極的健康權，均己提出。</p>
<p>美國國家資源設計局之一九四三年總報吿書中陳述之新人權宣言九項：「其中第四項，爲獲得安全，免除對衰老飢餓待賴疾病失業及傷害的恐怖之權」，第三項爲：「獲得適當的衣·食·生·及醫藥之權。</p>
<p>以上幾項，均是美國在戰事進行中，美國官方對於戰後人民權利的諾言，也是表國對於「健康權」的確認。</p>
<p>至於英國方面，在歐戰未結東前，已於一九四三年擬有卑維星奇報告書，設計一完善之社會安全制度。卑氏曾謂：「英國作戰的目的是打倒獨裁，其和平努力的目的，則在打倒英國人民之公敵—匱乏，疾病，失業，愚陋，汚穢……。對於疾病的辦法，是公醫與糧食政策……」。其實施辦法中，則是每一個人民均得享受免費醫藥治療的權利。戰爭結束後，已根據卑氏計劃，在本年三月裹制定起正式的「衛生法案」，自一九四八年起全國人民一律享有免費治療的權利。</p>
<p>所以從英·美·法·蘇各强國看，在幾年艱苦作戰中，人民終於追求到一個和平幸福，合理的社會，無論從計劃上，實施上，理論上，行動上，以及成文及不成文的法規上，都需要確定人民的「健康權」，並維護及增進其健康的發展。</p>
<p>我國久負着「東亞病夫」的雅號，病弱侵蝕着大多數人民，我們有着十分之三十的巨大的死亡率，每年有六百餘萬逾格死亡的寃死鬼。各項急慢性傳染病，終年流行，寄生虫地方病蔓延廣泛婦嬰病亡巨大。環境衛生不良，醫藥設施集中都市，醫藥費用大多數人無力負相。以致廣大的農業人口，終身從未接觸過醫藥，尤其是近代科學醫藥，比比皆是。即如北平南京等大都市戰前統計，患病至死從未受任何醫藥治療者（無論中西醫均未受治療），尙達百分之四十以上，其他各地，更可想見。戰爭不是自由犧牲的，英·美·法·蘇四國人民，已在建築起他們理想幸福的樂園，已在計劃着並實行他們的諾言，確保人民「健康權」的享有。以英·美·法·蘇戰前的衛生設施的普遍，和我國比較，眞不可以道里計，但戰事一停後，即急不暇待的竭力發展，並謀免費普遍供應全民。我國人民生長在這樣環境裏，豈不是更應當展費高呼，爭取基本人權之一的「健康權」嗎？</p>
<p>國民大會不久就要舉行了，憲法也即將制定了，在這人民世紀的時候，將「健康權」規定在憲中，取得憲法的保障，這是再重要不過的事。旣順應世界潮流，又適合國內需要，且有其他憲法成例可循，非自我作十。人民眼裏最淸楚，人民對政治看法也最現實。憲法是人民自己的憲法，現在正値討論五五憲草之時，與其斤斤較量中央與省的均權問題，或行政與立法牽制問題等，莫若多討論有關人民自身的重要權利，當必爲大衆所樂意接受的。　我們是五强之一了！我們希望其他四强人民所能享受到的人權，尤其是「健康權」，我們中華民國人民也就享受到。最要緊的一件事，就是將這次權利明戰在憲法中，五五憲草是沒有列入的。在憲法正式制定公布時，希望將「健康權」專列一條在人民權利章中，以滿足全民的需要。（本文作者通信處為四川宜賓中內硏究院人類學研究所，祇迎商討。）</p>

<h3>食糧市競爭異常混亂　粳秈出四萬關　糧部接洽採辦洋米　二批糧貸傳已擬定</h3>
<p>本市民食問題日趨嚴重，市勢之混亂，及市價之高昂，爲有史以來所罕見，現頂高價（市塲）白元已出五萬大關，頂白粳羊秈亦做開四萬一二千元，影響所及，至鉅且大，現若有十商人藉口米價高昂，開支增加，已將羅售品開高售價，長此以往，前途誠難逆料。</p>
<p>昨日各糧漲風甚銳，米價再漲三千元，麵粉塲外依然步昂，再加一千五六百元，油市亦猛躍五六千至七八千元，黃豆飛漲一二三千元，生仁跟上二三千元，豆餅不肯落後，上升八九百元，麩皮照樣升五六百元，各糧後來居上，加三四千元，芝蔴升二三千元，苞米亦帶上二千元，市面已少正式市價。</p>

<h3>金價升二萬五</h3>
<p>烚赤昨由平轉堅，證券帮獲利後之餘資稍有吸收，買氣在平淡中略見興奮，晨開平平，十時後始見活動，證券帮及廣帮稍來吸納，午刻復逼近一六〇萬大關，午後曾穿出一六〇萬大關而後稍回，結果回升二萬五，飾金掛升爲十七萬元，紋銀一千六，銀元仍在原價徘徊，暗拆自一角二分至一角六分。</p>

<h3>美鈔穏，港票俏</h3>
<p>美鈔疲後轉穩，惟過程極爲平庸，紗花結款轉往印港，以致美鈔較爲冷淡，晨開平平，開後有實貨流出，一度屈居二二九〇元左右，惟不久重振，午前在二三二〇元左右盤旋，後市繼續微升，結果較前收升起三十元，港票受紗花帮力扒港電影響，經營港匯者抵補頭襯，扒轉港紙，激漲二十八元，港電自四二〇元升至四四〇元，羅比五四〇元以上。</p>
<h3>平水新茶開秤　售價並不樂觀</h3>
<p>紹興平水所產之旗槍，其品質並不次於溫州貨，惟生產遲晚，延至昨日始見開　，適在本市茶市衰落期中，故開價亦未見樂觀，每担爲二十萬元，其他花色，買氣依然淡泊，而供售者則擾攘不絕，行情均陷於挫跌過程下云。</p>

<h3>呢絨明穏暗疲</h3>
<p>呢絨近除凡立頂·羽紗呢·螺四呢·派立司·紗蔴膠布·黃綠斜紋等諸夏貨外，少有交易，公茶會上市氣呆鈍，標準行情大半多呈明穩暗疲之象，一般夏貨之市况，賣者因貨底缺乏異常，實銷期尙有二個足月，不肯貶價遷就，買者因嫌始終在高峯盤旋，門莊出手困難，除不得已稍爲開進外，莫不遠較往年夏銷爲遜。</p>

<h3>新公司法　有限公司股東　尚有疑義待解釋</h3>
<p>本市會社師沈家偵等，以國府修訂之新公司法第五章第一〇五條，尙有懷疑之處，昨特呈經濟部，請予解釋。略謂「査新公司法第五章第一〇五條，有限公司須有股東二人以上，十人以下之組織云云，竊懷疑義。蓋本條所定二人以上，十人以下之股東人數，當係對創始組織而言。惟各股東之資力，因時變遷，豈能始終無動。譬如：一家有限公司，本由股東十人所組織，其後有一股東，因資力貧困，不能保持其原有股份，乃將股份之一部份，轉讓與他人，如果限定非原股東不能接受，則恐原股東或無意接受，或互相勾結，故抑股似，殊非所宜。若讓與另外一人，則此公司之股東人數，即在十人以上，依法規第一〇五條而言，似有違犯之嫌；但依第一二一條所云，股東可將股份之全部或一部，轉讓與他人而論，則並無違犯之處。未知究竟如何處置？爲特呈請鈞部鑒賜解釋，俾資遵循」云云！</p>

<h3>關於附逆影人</h3>
<p>— 徐蘇靈</p>
<p>在抗戰期間，上海的常影事業，被敵僞所操縱，而有一部份電影商與電影從業員，尤其在太平洋戰事爆發以後，他們由於悲觀的認識與過份的自私的觀念，竟甘心事敵，與敵僞合作，使整個上海的電影事業變做了敵偽統制下的機構。這中間，大多數的從業員，固因爲生活的壓逼，在此期間，不得不參加敵僞組織的電影事業機構。現在敵人屈降巳八越月，上海敵僞電影事業機構之除其原來與敵僞合作及出售於敵僞者外，若干部份原係向民間　佔或租用，經接收，有的已淸理發還，有的正在調査發還中，而一批附逆影人，除二一人已被逮捕外，其他多數，究竟是否需要懲處，或加以甄別，雖曾有　次的座談會和什麼會提起渦，但至今總未見有所決定。</p>
<p>中國電影事業原甚落後，人才亦十分缺乏，據個人所知，曾參加僞電影機構之多數從業員，確屬生活艱苦，而他們所製作的影片，其內容（我曾讀過所有「華影」出品的電影劇本）除極少數有問題者外，多數均無反對政府抗戰政策的。甚且有敎育意義的作品。固然，有少數「華影」高級人員，尤其在上層與敵僞合作的人員，不管他們是否中途又退出「華影」，而他們却是生活裕餘，足見他們在當時利用敵僞勢力以歛財，並剝削困苦的從業員，而勝利後反而照樣生活裕餘，抑且巧言掩飾其罪行，但是這批人，因爲不是純粹的從業員身份，在影片的片頭上也不一定有他們的名字，因之，倒反不被人們注意，加之他們有錢，可以四面八方地活動。然而大多數從業員，他們在電影藝術和按術上有的有過二十餘年的經騐，最少也六七年的歷史，他們現在正等待着法律的懲處，或是解放他們，雖然他們身體很自由，可是他們需要生活，需要工作，在附逆影人的身份未判明之前，他們不能獲得工作，尤其若干導演人員，在中國，培養一個電影導演是多麼不易。</p>
<p>我回到上海已有七八個月，因爲職務的關係，沒有說過什麽話。但是我看見應該被裁制的反而有辦法，而那些平時淸苦非凡的從業員却一動也不能動地無法生活，我忍不住要向富局和關心電影事業的人們提出幾點意見來：</p>
<p>一·請主管當局與司法機關，迅速調査及檢舉附逆影人，並懲治之（雖然我知道有關機構已提出了檢舉名單，但是迄今未見下文）。同時並頒訂參加僞電影機構人員處罰辦法，使少數甘心事敵的份于得其應得之懲處，而多數從業員亦可以在一定的辦法之下得恢復其工作。</p>
<p>二·請關心電影事業的人士和電影從業員自己搜集附逆影人之罪行證據，向政府主管機構檢舟舉，或直接向法院吿發。</p>
<p>三·請政府主管機構派員會同有聲望的學者，審査所謂僞「華影」的全部出品，俾從作品中判別電影從業員的罪行。</p>
<h3>記「聖瑪麗亞之鐘聲」兩主角</h3>
<p>— 新鳴</p>
<p>一九四五年度美國賣座第一，而被視爲最佳的電影是「聖瑪麗亞之鐘聲」“The　Bells　Of　St　Mary's”一片，其所以受人如此的歡迎，由於主演人平克勞斯貝和英格麗褒曼二人演技的精湛，導演李歐麥克萊Leo　MoCarey氏手法的新頴，處理的老練。</p>
<p>此片問世於去年耶誕節前，爲歡迎和平後第一次的盛節的珍貴禮物。當紐的放映時，美國人的確有些瘋在了，每天戲院門口，人山人海爭先恐後。遠勝上海諸賣座片客滿的盛况，可見美國人的愛好電影實令人咋舌，以及此片的驚人。該片是平克勞斯貝所經營的Rainbow公司出品，而由雷電華公司發行的。</p>
<p>現在要說到兩個主角；男主角平克勞斯貝從影已十八年了，近幾年來在好萊塢十分走紅，竟榮獲了二次十大賣座明星的首椅於一九四四年，一九四五年。他曾和桃樂珊拉摩合作演出過好多片子，上海映過的如「南國之春」“Road　To　Sningapore”「游碼頭」“Road　To　Zanzibar”等。看過他的影片後，我想沒有一個人不陶醉於他的低音歌喉吧！他不但在銀幕上成名，更致力於播音事業。至於在「聖瑪麗亞之鐘聲」中，他飾一個神父具有敎育心切的精神，創辦一所學校，在學校裏衝滿着他的關切，慈愛，溫暖。</p>
<p>至於女主角英格麗褒曼，她是一個端典人。和李思廉霍華合演的「寒夜琴挑」是使她成名的第一個戲，以後演過「大家庭」，「化身博士」，“Casablanca”，「戰地鐘聲」等，每片都博得好評。去年他主演了「蠱惑記」“Spellbound”和葛理戈派克合演，“Saratoga　Trnnk”和賈萊古柏合演以及「聖瑪麗亞之鐘聲」三張巨片。在美國最有名的生活（Life）雜誌上居然說一九四五年是蒦曼年。「聖瑪麗亞之鐘聲」中她扮演一個犬主敎堂中的姆姆，演技臻善臻美，登峯造極。還有亨利區萊佛Henry　Traver亦有很好的成績，飾演一個善作怪想，好出怨言的地主。你記得嗎？在忠勇之家中的站長自勒德亦就是他呀！此綠葉之襯，使每片生色不少。</p>
<h3>好萊塢航訊</h3>
<p>原子彈兩顆結束了第二次世界大戰，好萊塢製片家很明瞭這個名字的刺激性。無不紛紛設法取得以原子彈發放的情節作爲電影劇本，米高梅公司已採用了保勃康斯丹的劇本，據該片桑馬克斯云：該片叙述原子彈製造人不長犧牲努力硏究，以至吿成的情形，雖非紀錄影片，但有事實根據，拍攝時美國科學家協會選派專家担任顧問，並與原子彈管理委員會取得聯絡。</p>
<p>朗結考爾門在銀壇上的地位，是和的翰巴里摩，范朋克並駕齊驅，而今獨考爾門屹立影壇，由無聲到有聲到五彩，跨兩時代光榮，誠非易易，今年六員抵將與米高梅合同滿期，考爾門擬就此吿老退休。</p>

<h3>Marshall Mediation Enters New Stage; Northeast Gloom Gradually Shows Signs of Clearing; Ceasefire Order May Be Issued Early Next Week</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Chongqing Dispatch, 27th] The perilous and gloomy situation in the Northeast has, through the efforts of the Democratic League, the Youth Party, and non-partisan third-party individuals, along with the active progress of ceasefire talks in the Northeast, allowed Marshal Marshall's mediation talks to enter a new stage, showing a slight sign of clearing up. At 10:00 AM yesterday, Marshal Marshall once again invited Luo Longji and Zhang Junmai to discuss steps and plans for stopping military conflict in the Northeast and clarifying the serious situation there. However, Marshal Marshall's attitude was serious and cautious, and he expressed strong confidence in peace and the political situation in the Northeast. Marshal Marshall originally planned to leave Chongqing for Beijing today, but due to the alarming deterioration of the situation in the Northeast, he decided to wait for Chairman Chiang to return to Chongqing and for an agreement on the Northeast ceasefire issue to be reached before setting a departure date. It is also learned that at 7:00 PM last night, the Democratic League delegation invited Zhou Enlai, the representative of the Chinese Communist Party, to exchange views on the Northeast issue. It is reported that the opinions of the government and the Communist Party are quite close.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Beiping Dispatch, 27th] Well-informed observers say that a Northeast ceasefire agreement may be signed before Marshall flies to Beijing. They are certain that Chairman Chiang has made a major decision to compromise, but they say that this agreement should not shake the government's principle of receiving sovereignty, and at least the cities along the main Northeast railway line should be completely taken over by the government.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Beiping Dispatch, 27th] After the news of the impending signing of the Northeast ceasefire agreement in Chongqing reached here, the reporter visited Zheng Jiemin, a member of the Executive Headquarters, to inquire about the truth. Zheng said that as of now, the Executive Headquarters has not received any information from Chongqing regarding this matter, but he believes that this matter is possible, because the plan proposed by Marshal Marshall has been carefully considered for a long time, and it contains elements that both sides may accept. The reporter also learned from a certain source that the government will not give up the transfer of sovereignty over the Northeast, but the method can be reconsidered.</p>
<p>[United Press Chongqing Dispatch, 27th] Well-informed sources today strengthened their confidence, saying that the order to cease conflict in the Northeast may be issued early next week, and the final resolution of the political agreement and military issues will be discussed at a later meeting in Nanjing.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Chongqing Dispatch, 27th] Special Envoy Marshall received Zhang Lan and Luo Longji, representatives of the Democratic League, at Yiyuan at 10:00 AM on the 27th, and the meeting lasted until 11:15 AM. After Zhang and Luo left, Marshal Marshall continued to discuss with Zhou Enlai, the representative of the Chinese Communist Party.</p>
<p>[Associated Press Chongqing Dispatch, 27th] Special Envoy Marshall is obviously doing his best to enable the Kuomintang and the Communist Party to reach a ceasefire agreement before moving to Nanjing. Marshal Marshall had a long meeting with Zhou Enlai this morning and went to Linyuan in the afternoon to continue negotiations after Chairman Chiang returned from Chengdu. Chen Cheng, the government representative of the three-person group, is now in Nanjing, and although the government has sent another representative to replace him, Chairman Chiang and Marshal Marshall are both willing to negotiate directly with the highest authorities of the three parties. It goes without saying that Chairman Chiang has full authority to sign any agreement. Zhou Enlai said that he has been authorized to sign an "unconditional ceasefire" agreement without having to ask for instructions from Yan'an. The Communist Party spokesman said that Communist leaders believe that there is hope for a Northeast ceasefire agreement to be reached before Marshal Marshall leaves Chongqing for Beijing. It is feared that Marshal Marshall will depart for Beijing on the 29th. If no ceasefire agreement is announced before his departure, it will be sufficient to indicate that a cessation of conflict will not be possible in the near future, but if Marshal Marshall postpones his departure for Beijing, it will indicate that the ceasefire agreement is still in progress. Although there is still no concrete manifestation here to prove that Marshal Marshall has enabled the Kuomintang and the Communist Party to reach a new ceasefire agreement, Chongqing is still shrouded in an atmosphere of optimism, and all parties seem to be working together to stop the war in the Northeast at least before the return to the capital.</p>
<h3>A Grand Gathering in Chengdu Yesterday Afternoon; Chairman Chiang Gave a Public Banquet for All Walks of Life; His Affection and Expectations for Sichuan Overflowed in His Words</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Chengdu Dispatch, 27th] As the National Government's Chairman Chiang is about to leave Sichuan after the victorious return to the capital, he bid farewell to the elders in Sichuan and held a public banquet at the Military Academy's New Life Society at 12:00 noon on the 27th for leaders of various institutions and organizations in the provincial capital, including dignitaries, scholars, party officials, government officials, military officials, and civilians, as well as virtuous members of society, senior officers of the Army and Air Force schools, descendants of fallen soldiers in the War of Resistance, and foreigners in Chengdu. A total of 241 people, including Liu Yubo, Shao Mingshu, Zhang Qun, Deng Xihou, Liu Wenhui, Huang Jilu, Xiang Chuanyi, Zhangjia, Li Huang, and Wu Yifang, gathered together, making it an unprecedented grand gathering in Chengdu. The Chairman entered to the sound of military music, and everyone stood at attention to pay their respects. The Chairman smiled and shook hands with Liu Yubo, who was nearly 90 years old, and Shao Mingshu, who was 75 years old, and nodded to the whole audience. During the meal, music was played from time to time, and the atmosphere was solemn and joyful. After the meal, the Chairman stood up and delivered a speech, explaining the glory of Sichuan in the history of the National Revolution, the status of Sichuan during the War of Resistance, and the importance of Sichuan in the future period of national construction, as well as the great responsibility of the Sichuan people for national construction. His words were earnest and moving (the full text will be published after being organized), and his deep affection for Sichuan and his high expectations for Sichuan overflowed in his words. When he mentioned that the Chengdu-Chongqing, Chengdu-Tianfu, Sichuan-Yunnan, and Sichuan-Guizhou railways and the Dujiangyan Hydropower Plant in western Sichuan would be completed within the next three to five years, the whole audience responded with warm applause that lasted for a long time. The speech lasted 34 minutes. After the speech, applause rose again, and Xiang Chuanyi, the Speaker of the Provincial Assembly, presented a signed commemorative album on behalf of the people from all walks of life, read a eulogy, and stated the hardships of the people and their enthusiastic support for the government's measures to build Sichuan. After the eulogy, the whole audience stood up and wished the Chairman good health. This was followed by a brief speech by Liu Yubo, and then a speech by Zhang Qun, the Chairman of Sichuan Province, who said that when Chairman Chiang came to Sichuan in the 24th year of the Republic (1935), he made stability, unification, and construction the three tasks of governing Sichuan. Stability and unification were achieved in a few years, so Sichuan was able to support the overall situation and shoulder the heavy responsibility of the base of the War of Resistance since the military campaign. However, construction was difficult due to wartime difficulties. After the war, the Chairman designated Sichuan as an experimental zone for construction, with the aim of accelerating the completion of Sichuan's construction. In fact, the Chairman had already instructed that construction was one of the three major tasks of governing Sichuan eleven years ago, which is enough to show that the Chairman has a consistent position on Sichuan. He then said that most of the War of Resistance was in Sichuan, and he also served as the Governor of the province for a year. Now that he is about to return to the capital and leave Sichuan, we cannot help but feel reluctant to leave. The Chairman also said that he regarded Sichuan as his second hometown, which is also a glory in Sichuan's history, and that future generations will always remember the Chairman's achievements in creating Sichuan as a base for national revival. From now on, the people of Sichuan should inherit the spirit of winning the war during the war and strive for the success of Sichuan's construction. They also hope that the Chairman will give instructions from time to time, and all sectors will work together to live up to the importance of Sichuan's position in the country. Finally, Shao Mingshu delivered a speech, saying that the entire territory of the country is under the Chairman's rule. Although he is now leaving Sichuan and returning to Nanjing, his teachings and leadership to the people of Sichuan in the future will not be different from Chongqing and Nanjing. This meeting, which is of great historical significance to Sichuan, did not end until 3:00 PM.</p>

<p>[Our Chongqing Dispatch, 27th] According to a telegram received by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the 22nd from our embassy in Egypt, former US President Hoover flew from Cairo to Chongqing on the 21st to investigate the postwar disaster situation in China, in order to allocate grain for relief. However, the US Embassy has not yet received notification. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has telegraphed New Delhi for inquiries and has notified the Gendarmerie Headquarters, the Municipal Government, the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, the Ministry of Food, and the Ministry of Social Affairs to discuss reception arrangements. Premier of the Executive Yuan, Soong Tzu-wen, has offered his official residence at Hongyan Village as a reception center. The itinerary has been determined as follows: If Chairman Chiang is in Chongqing, the first evening banquet will be hosted by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs or the Executive Yuan, the second day will involve an audience with Chairman Chiang, meetings with government officials, a luncheon hosted by the US Embassy, and an evening banquet hosted by the Chairman. If Chairman Chiang is away from Chongqing, the first evening banquet will be hosted by the Chongqing Municipal Government, the second day a luncheon by the US Embassy, and an evening banquet by the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, this city dispatch] Hoover, the personal representative of the US President and representative of the US Emergency Relief Committee, originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai at 6:00 PM today, has postponed his arrival to tomorrow (Monday) afternoon due to delays in India. Various sectors are preparing a welcome. Yesterday at 3:00 PM, Minister of Food Hsu Kan convened a meeting at the UNRRA office with key figures from UNRRA and the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration to hear reports and prepare for the visit of former US President Hoover, representative of the US Emergency Relief Committee. Attendees included UNRRA's China representative, Auster, UNRRA Director-General, Keyes, Relief and Rehabilitation Administration Director-General, Chiang Ting-fu, Shanghai Director, Liu Hongsheng, and many other key figures.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing Dispatch, 27th] Former US President Hoover, accompanied by his wife and 17 staff members, will visit China in early next month as the Chairman of the UN Food and Agriculture Organization, planning to stay for seven days. It is expected he will spend one day in Shanghai, two days in Beijing, and a day and a half in Chongqing, before spending two and a half days inspecting the disaster situation in Hengyang, Guilin, Kaifeng, and Beiping.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Bangalore Dispatch, 27th] As Envoy Hoover traveled eastward by car through the famine area of Mysore Province, emaciated men and women, half-naked and starving, lined the roadside to welcome him. Some famine victims personally pleaded with Hoover for relief. The villages Hoover passed through yesterday were all in areas officially declared by the government as famine-stricken, where food rationing is extremely strict, and what is actually received is only about one-third of the rationed amount. Officials explained to Hoover that the food reserves there were insufficient for one month, and it was better to keep the villagers half-starved now than to let them starve to death next month. Upon arriving in Madhugiri, Hoover addressed the residents, announcing his decision to transport grain for relief. He stated that in solving the food crisis, the food problem in China should not be neglected. If we want to understand the extent of the food shortage in China today and what relief methods to take, we must delve into the disaster areas for on-the-spot investigation and explore the root cause in order to find a solution. Harrison also said: Having arrived in China only a week ago, he has listened to the reports from both UNRRA and the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration on the survey findings and their relief efforts for the disaster victims. Harrison believes that China lacks concrete statistics for the production and distribution of various foods, making the work more difficult than in other countries. He is now awaiting instructions from Washington before commencing work. He and his three staff members hope to personally inspect the disaster areas in the near future and then prescribe the right remedies.</p>
<h3>Wang Maogong Discusses Inspection Impressions: Order Restored, Construction Prospects Hopeful</h3>
<p>[Our Zhenjiang Dispatch, 27th] Upon Chairman Wang Maogong of Jiangsu Province's return from inspection, our reporter visited him. He kindly shared his impressions of this trip, excerpted and recorded on the right: (1) In Jiangyin, 60% of the houses were destroyed by the enemy and puppets during the War of Resistance, and the people's economy is extremely strained. Now that order has been restored, the people are able to live and work in peace, and the relationship between local party, government, military, and organizations is very harmonious. (2) The discipline of the Nantong security team is excellent, and social order is more stable than before. Construction prospects are hopeful. Secondary education is still inadequate, and the local area has added a private school to accommodate more students. The county currently has seven districts that have established a political foundation. Refugees have gathered in the urban area, with over 100,000 residents. It is hoped that a large amount of grain, medicine, and relief supplies will be quickly allocated and transported for relief. (3) Elders and representatives of public opinion organs in various places have focused their discussions on strengthening public security and enriching autonomous finances. The provincial government will work hard to reorganize autonomous donations and taxes and request subsidies from the central government to achieve a balance of income and expenditure. (4) Wuxi and Nantong are both industrial areas in Jiangsu Province. Although many factories have resumed operations, due to a lack of various conditions, they are still far from pre-war standards and require further efforts. A stable environment is necessary to ensure the prosperous development of construction enterprises.</p>

<p>[Associated Press, Nanjing Dispatch, 27th] National Assembly representatives are still arriving in Beijing one after another, some from as far as India and Thailand.

Yan'an predicted a month ago that the Assembly would not be able to convene until June, or even later. The Communist Party has long hoped that the Assembly would be held in October, allowing all parties ample time to adjust important national issues.</p>

<h3>Chen and Miao, Two Traitors, Both Submit New Exculpatory Evidence, Possible Retrial, Two Female Hanjians from Yunnan Sent to the Supreme Court for Investigation and Trial</h3>
<p>[Our Suzhou Dispatch, 27th] Chen Gongbo and Miao Bin, two traitors, have both applied for retrial because they disagree with their death sentences. Recently, people from all walks of life have been greatly concerned about whether the Supreme Court will overturn the original judgment and order a new retrial, and there have been rumors that the retrial dates have been determined. In order to clarify the truth, our reporter visited Sun Honglin, the President of the Jiangsu High Court, on the 27th to inquire. He told us that the two traitors' applications for retrial documents and first instance case files were only sent to the Supreme Court on the 25th. Although Miao's documents were sent out more than ten days ago, the High Court has not received any news. Moreover, the Supreme Court does not need to expedite the handling of Hanjians' retrial cases. The outside rumors are just speculation. Our reporter then asked about his opinion on the two traitors' applications for retrial. He replied that according to legal procedures, the Supreme Court has no more than the following three dispositions: (1) To consider the submitted documents and directly uphold the sentence for execution. (2) To issue a retrial order not limited to the original trial court. (3) To issue a retrial order to the original trial court. However, since both Chen and Miao have submitted new exculpatory evidence, the Supreme Court's decision will most likely be the third option. The reporter continued to ask if Chen Bijun and Chu Minyi had requested retrials. He replied that the High Court had not received any written applications to date. The reporter further inquired whether the government's amnesty would apply to Hanjians. He replied that it depends on the amnesty regulations. However, Hanjians are criminals against the country and the nation, endangering the foundation of the nation. Their impact is not as limited as ordinary criminal offenses that only affect individuals or a small number of people. It seems extremely unlikely that they will be granted amnesty, otherwise, where would the national discipline lie? President Sun finished speaking with indignation. The reporter then took his leave and departed.</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 27th] The Hebei High Court will start investigating the giant Hanjians recently transferred to the court today.

The section from Chongqing to Yichang has chartered five vessels: Minhui, Minxie, Minyun, Minfu, and Minwu, each capable of carrying 50 tons. From Yichang to Hankou, it will be transported by tugboat barges, so Sichuan grain arriving in Hankou will become a steady stream.

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Two Years of Democracy's Important Events</h3>
<p>—Postponement of the National Assembly and the Election of Shanghai Municipal Senators—</p>
<p>Recently, two things have a significant relationship with the future of China's implementation of democratic politics: The first is that on the 25th of this month, the National Government suddenly issued an order announcing the postponement of the National Assembly scheduled for May 5th, without specifying a new date. The second is today's election of the first session of municipal senators by the citizens of Shanghai. We would like to offer some opinions on these two matters:</p>
<p>The National Assembly, which the people have been eagerly awaiting, has been postponed by order of the National Government. Although the government has its own difficulties, especially with Chairman Chiang Kai-shek maintaining a modest and receptive attitude, expressing the determination to strive for a peaceful resolution of the political impasse, which deserves our respect, the general public's judgment of right and wrong remains clear. The people have long recognized the true face of the Communist Party, which harbors conspiracies to obstruct the National Assembly, more clearly than the government's constant struggles and the Allied envoy General Marshall. From the perspective of democratic politics, the most incomprehensible thing is: Why do these "democracy" peddlers, who usually boast and sing praises of "democracy," obstruct it in every possible way when the people are truly about to be in charge?</p>
<p>The National Assembly was scheduled to convene before the War of Resistance, and representatives from various regions had already been elected, but it was forced to be postponed due to the outbreak of the war. At that time, we only knew that the Communist Party and politicians who echoed them criticized the government for not convening the National Assembly sooner. When the government set the date for November 12th of last year, after the Japanese invaders had already surrendered, it was reasonable to convene as scheduled. However, this group of "democracy" peddlers, while holding armed separatist regimes in various regions, also shouted slogans of "peace and unity," stubbornly preventing the convening of the National Assembly, even resorting to alarmist claims, shamelessly stating that if they were not consulted first, convening the National Assembly would be tantamount to creating a "civil war." In order to strive for peace, the government, with the sincerity of a political solution, convened the Political Consultative Conference. After several consultations, it was finally agreed that the National Assembly would be convened as scheduled on May 5th of this year, and the number of representatives from various parties and so-called "social elites" was stipulated, trying to accommodate the opinions of their so-called "democratic" parties in order to achieve satisfactory results. The common people eagerly waited for the National Assembly to establish a constitution, believing that democratic politics could finally be realized. However, the Communist Party, on the one hand, conspired to rely on a powerful neighbor, occupying the Northeast and sowing the seeds of a future second puppet Manchuria. On the other hand, using the Northeast issue and the number of government committee members as pretexts, they always held back their "Democratic League," jointly refusing to submit the list of National Assembly representatives, in order to prevent the convening of the National Assembly and to coerce the government into making concessions. According to reason and law, since the government had repeatedly announced to the people that the National Assembly would be convened on a fixed date and had vowed not to postpone it again, it could have been ignored at this point. However, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek ultimately respected the opinions of all parties and decided to postpone the convocation. For the government, this can be described as having done its utmost, but from the perspective of democracy, it is not the normal way and should not be taken as a model. However, this responsibility should clearly be borne solely by the Communist Party.</p>
<p>Under a democratic political system, the people should be valued most, not a few factional politicians. We currently cannot understand: Why does the government seem to only recognize a few "democracy" peddlers from various parties, while neglecting the true masters of the country—the people? The National Assembly, which the people have been waiting for for nearly a decade, was finally about to be born, but it was postponed due to the eloquent words of a few "democracy" peddlers. Is it only the opinions of the Communist Party and the Democratic League that are "public opinion," while the opinions of other parties and the general public do not count as public opinion at all? Is it only the opinions of certain anti-government parties that should be "respected," while the opinions of the general public can be completely ignored? It is true that the people desire peace and oppose war; but what the people hate most are those violent groups who chant peace while engaging in fighting! The Communist Party chants peace, so it deprives the National Army of its right to self-defense, allowing the National Army to only be beaten and not allowed to fight back. The Communist Party engages in fighting, so it obstructs the government's takeover of the Northeast, allowing only the Communist Party to establish a separatist regime and not allowing administrative unification. And now, some people still believe that the government wants to use "military solutions," and some people believe that "military solutions" will eliminate democracy. In reality, the Communist Party is the one who most wants military solutions! Just look at how, after seizing Changchun and Harbin, the Communist Party loudly proclaimed that the overall situation in the Northeast had changed, that the Communist Party was unwilling to make any more concessions, and that it forced the central government to recognize their so-called "Democratic Allied Forces" and "Democratic Regime." From this, we can know how the Communist Party is obsessed with military solutions and how it entrusts its so-called "democracy" to the military force that it temporarily obtained by illegally using enemy weapons and equipment! If the National Government respects their opinions simply because they have some military force, believing that this is public opinion, then we must speak out for the people in northern Jiangsu, Shandong, and the Northeast, who unfortunately do not have this kind of military force! We ask, do those people truly want to be ruled by the Communist Party's "democratic government"? Honestly speaking, the people in those areas all hope that the National Army will come quickly to protect their lives, and they all hope for the arrival of the central government's orders, just like waiting for rain during a severe drought. They are still blaming the central government every day for sitting idly by while they are trapped in the midst of fire and water. The representatives they elected have already arrived in Nanjing, ready to attend the National Assembly and make normal appeals. Where would they hope for the National Assembly to be postponed?</p>
<p>Moreover, the National Assembly representatives from Shanghai, Nanjing, and even other regions have recently been advocating that they should still gather in Nanjing as scheduled, awaiting the central government to set a new date for the meeting as soon as possible. This is public opinion, this is true public opinion. Whoever wants democracy, whoever wants to implement democratic politics, must respect this true public opinion. The opinions of certain parties and the opinions of these National Assembly representatives, when measured on the scale of "democratic politics," should undoubtedly be weighted more heavily than the former. Moreover, to truly prevent the outbreak of "civil war" in China, the only way is to convene the National Assembly as soon as possible, listen to the voices of true people's representatives, and let the people themselves, in their capacity as masters, impartially judge the affairs of the country. Everyone uses words instead of violence, which is the right path to democracy. Therefore, although the government has postponed the convocation of the National Assembly out of sincere consultation, believing that this can leave room for maneuver and resolution, in our view, this kind of breach of faith and indulgence will inevitably lead to a more chaotic situation. After the postponement of the National Assembly was announced, the Communist Party openly proposed to revise the "Political Consultative Conference" agreement, which is another manifestation of their inching forward. It is conceivable that postponing the convening of the National Assembly cannot resolve the impasse, or may even increase troubles. The true intentions of the people are definitely not what they expect from the government. Therefore, today we have the right to demand that the government, in addition to the so-called "parties," truly investigate where the true intentions of the people lie. We also have the right to demand that the government must value the opinions of the elected National Assembly representatives from various regions and quickly convene the National Assembly in the near future. This is the only great path to lead China onto democratic politics!</p>
<p>Secondly, we want to talk about the election of municipal senators in Shanghai. Shanghai is China's first trading port, with a large population, thriving industry and commerce, and municipal administration that needs to be promoted, which is indeed a concern for both Chinese and foreign observers. This election is also urgent after the temporary municipal council has held a meeting once, and it is also appropriately timed at the unification of administrative power with the recovery of concessions, therefore the establishment of a formal public opinion institution should be highly valued by the citizens. Recently, the enthusiastic competition of candidates seems to have created a new atmosphere of democracy, which is not a phenomenon unworthy of celebration. Even if some people think that receptions, tea parties, banquets, etc., are inevitably wasteful, but since everyone wants democracy, as long as there are no illegal acts, no corrupt schemes, then using various methods to attract voters to promote candidates, in Western democratic countries, is also "common practice." Just look at the film "Wilson" that was recently screened in Shanghai, and you can get a glimpse of it. As for those who have personally witnessed the grand occasion of elections in various European and American countries, they will naturally not be surprised. "Democratic politics," in some places, is originally a money-consuming politics, it is also a time-consuming politics, and it is even more a politics that consumes a lot of talking. If you want democracy in your heart, but you think you can't get used to these things when you see them, this is due to our inertia and our accumulated habits. First of all, everyone must transform our old concept of "three visits to the thatched cottage," believing that in the era of democratic elections, we must sit at home and wait for a gentleman to come and ask for an audience. If this is really the case, then in the advanced countries of Western democracy, they would not have campaign speeches and campaign broadcasts. Also, after listening to campaign speeches or broadcasts, everyone criticizes each other, attacks each other, and fights with each other. As long as they do not violate the defamation law, it is not surprising to see them laughing, scolding, and scolding each other. Currently, we only see a few slogans, a few leaflets, a few speeches, and a few tea parties, and we immediately discuss them in the streets and alleys, believing that this trend cannot last long; in fact, these are all thoughts that do not conform to the democratic era!</p>
<p>However, we would like to solemnly inform all qualified voters in Shanghai that today everyone must cherish the election ticket that they should cast. We were not only very pleased and excited to hear the news that Mayor Qian will personally go to the polling station to vote, but we also sincerely hope that all voters in Shanghai, regardless of gender, wealth, or poverty, will use the receipt of their national ID card to solemnly go to the polls and carefully consider the ideal candidate in their minds and elect him as a senator. The Kuomintang's political tutelage is to train the people to exercise four kinds of political power, and today's election of municipal senators is the official beginning of Shanghai citizens' exercise of the right to vote. "The beginning is easy, but the end is great!" We must know that today's vote is not just a vote, it is related to the entire municipal administration of Shanghai, and it is even more related to the local foundation of democratic politics in the country. If today's election of local self-government can be ignored, then in the future, we will not be able to muster interest in the election of the central government; democratic politics can never build its foundation on the bodies of people who have no interest or enthusiasm for politics! Today we have nothing else to say, but to advise every voter to cherish his own election ticket. Cherishing one's own vote is the beginning of democratic politics, and it is also the success of democratic politics!</p>

<p>Hangzhou</p>
<p>Municipal Government Plans to Construct Wushan</p>
<p>Wushan in Hangzhou is a historical site and also the high point in the bustling city of the provincial capital. The open space in the mountains, if it were in European and American countries, would be well utilized, but we have abandoned it, which is a pity. Now, at the suggestion of the Municipal Provisional Council, in order to revitalize the commercial market, it is planned to establish an amusement market on Wushan, and to set up ticket offices at the surrounding Cuihuan Tower and Liangdao Mountain, and install elevators to facilitate tourists. All temples with historical relics will be preserved, and temples with superstitious colors will be requisitioned for public use as government property, designed and converted into hotels, restaurants, and other shops and stalls, like the Andong Market in Beiping. The municipal government has instructed the relevant departments to jointly review and implement this plan.</p>
<p>Hefei</p>
<p>Precursor to Construction of Xinliu Highway</p>
<p>The Pushan Road, which was started in the 3rd year of the Republic of China, was halted due to the First World War. The Heye Road, which was started in the 26th year of the Republic of China, was also interrupted due to the outbreak of the War of Resistance, causing the traffic between western Anhui and Henan and Hubei to be blocked until now. Now, the Second District Engineering Administration of the Highway Administration of the Ministry of Transportation has decided to build the Han, Tian, and Liuliu Roads to facilitate the intersection of traffic in Anhui, Henan, and Hubei. Engineers Liu Tianmin, Wang Jin, and Li Qinglin have been dispatched, starting from Xinyang, to survey the center line along the way to Liu'an in order to begin construction.</p>

The Anhui Provincial Local Bank is also preparing to establish a branch in Mingguang, at the original site of the former Wufeng Yinhang on Beida Street. The layout is about to be completed, and it is said that the opening date is also set for May 1st.</p>
<p>Wenling</p>
<p>Holding Fair Price Sales to Relieve Food Shortages</p>

<h3>Foreign Ministers Conference Proceeding Smoothly Italy Issue Agreed Upon Soviet Union Opposes Discussion of Austrian Issue Bevin Flew Back to London Yesterday to Seek Instructions</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper] London, 27th (broadcast): The four-power foreign ministers are scheduled to hold their third meeting this afternoon (i.e., 4:00 a.m. on the 28th in Shanghai) to strive for an agreement to include the Austria-Germany issue on the agenda. The United States requested a discussion on the Austrian issue, but the Soviet Union opposed it. Generally speaking, the atmosphere of this meeting is quite harmonious, completely different from the table-thumping and shouting scenes at the London conference. There are no serious conflicts between the representatives of Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, and the Soviet representative Molotov is very steady in his attitude.</p>
<p>Another report: Tomorrow is Sunday, and although the four-power foreign ministers will not hold a meeting, they will not rest. They will discuss the contents of the treaty with Italy with their military, naval, and political advisors. (Another report) British Foreign Secretary Bevin flew back to London after the meeting today to seek instructions and meet with South African Prime Minister Smuts, and decided to return to Paris on Monday. Currently, the Soviet Union is accepting the US proposal to amend the Allied armistice agreement with Italy.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Paris, 27th] The four-nation foreign ministers' conference has reached a critical stage today, and the United States seems to be determined to insist on the withdrawal of the occupying forces of various countries stationed in Austria, regardless of Soviet opposition, and to recognize Austria as a truly independent country. Byrnes said that he is prepared to ask all countries to accept the US-proposed handling of Austria at today's meeting, and at the same time propose that the port of Trieste should still belong to Italy. It is expected that the four-nation foreign ministers will make a decision on the above two issues or one of them at today's meeting. (According to authoritative sources in London, Bevin will suggest to Byrnes that the Pacific Defense Conference be held by the US, Britain, Australia, and New Zealand in Canberra to prepare for the future seven-power conference, when France, Portugal, the Netherlands, and other countries will be invited to participate again. Australian Prime Minister Chifley may go to Washington within two weeks to discuss with President Truman the issue of joint defense of Surabaya, Batavia, and Timor proposed by Australia.)</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Paris, 26th] The foreign ministers of the United States, the Soviet Union, Britain, and France held a second meeting in the Luxembourg Palace today. An agreement has been reached on the issue of Italian reparations, but opinions are still divided on whether to include the Ruhr and Austrian issues on the agenda. At the meeting, the controversial points of the Italian peace treaty were discussed first, and then it was decided in principle that Italian reparations should be limited to what it can afford. The four foreign ministers have also agreed on the preamble of the treaty, stating that Italy should be held responsible for the war's calamity. The original American text for demanding any compensation from Italy was followed by the Soviet request for Italy to pay substantial compensation, but stipulated that a committee of experts should investigate the country's ability to pay. The Soviet Union reiterated its request for Italy to pay 300 million US dollars in reparations. The United States only allowed Italy to pay reparations without borrowing from foreign countries. When the committee of experts decides on its ability to pay, it cannot strip its factory equipment, various machines, armory settings, and merchant ships. The Italian navy, which the Soviet Union is concerned about, was not mentioned. The current worry is that if Italy can pay reparations without borrowing from the US and Britain, then the US and Britain may also raise demands.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 26th] Acting Secretary of State Acheson announced today that the United States, the Soviet Union, and France have agreed to accept the US proposal to amend the Italian armistice agreement signed 30 months ago, so as to ease the armistice conditions.</p>
<h3>Security Council's Impasse on the Spanish Question May Be Broken Soviet Representative Has Telegraphed Molotov for Instructions Madrid Military Region Cancels Leave for Officers and Soldiers</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper] London, 27th (broadcast): The stalemate in the Security Council caused by the Franco issue now has the possibility of being broken. Although the Soviet representative still firmly opposes investigating the situation in Spain, he has telegraphed Molotov for instructions on whether to concede to the compromise proposal of the representatives of Australia, France, and Poland. It is expected that the foreign ministers of the United States and Britain will urge Molotov in Paris not to allow the Security Council to fall into a complete stalemate.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, New York, 26th] The Security Council was again deadlocked on the Spanish issue today. It is now hoped that the Soviet Union, which holds a dissenting opinion, can change its attitude so that the Australian proposal to investigate the Franco regime in Spain can be unanimously passed. The representatives have clearly agreed to the proposal revised twice by the Australian representative Hodgson (see yesterday's newspaper for the new proposal), but the Soviet representative Gromyko disagrees. Gromyko opposed sending any committee or delegation to investigate Spain yesterday, saying that Spain has long become a threat to world peace, and there is no need for further investigation. If so, the Soviet Union will definitely insist on its position against the new proposal.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Madrid, 26th] According to today's news: Routine leave for the Spanish army in the Madrid military region has been canceled, and soldiers must report back to camp on Monday. Although officials have not confirmed this news, United Nations officials said that this action is not surprising, because the Spanish government has publicly stated that it is paying attention to the situation on the French-Spanish border, saying that there is considerable Communist-inspired activity there. According to another source: The two divisions under the command of General Grande, who previously participated in the war against the Soviet Union in the "Blue Division," are now stationed in the Madrid military region, awaiting orders to move out.</p>
<h3>US Military Seizes Large Quantities of Mongolian Counterfeit Money in Japan</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 27th special cable] The US occupation forces discovered 258 boxes of Mongolian banknotes printed by Japan, with a value of 800 million Japanese yen, completely new, in a freight yard at the port of Tsuruga in northern Honshu. It is said that the banknotes were intended to be used in Inner Mongolia, and used at the same wartime face value as the Japanese yen.</p>
<h3>Threat to Peace: The Soviet Union! Remarks by U.S. Congressman Barry</h3>
<p>[United Press International, Washington, 27th] Democratic Congressman Barry stated today that if the United States were to investigate Spain, then the United States should also investigate all countries behind the Soviet Union's Iron Curtain. Barry telegraphed Stettinius, saying, "All non-Communist representatives in United Nations organizational meetings know that the only country that may threaten world peace is not Spain, but the Soviet Union. The American people do not wish to appease the Soviets any further. Now is the time to exert the leverage we still have, and we should stop here. Every time we encounter Soviet hostility, we either reach a stalemate or the Soviet Union wins, and America's dignity in the world is becoming weaker day by day." Barry concluded by saying that a communist Spain would control Britain's lifeline in the Mediterranean and place the European countries that have not yet become communist under Moscow's control.</p>
<h3>Anniversary of the San Francisco Conference: Truman Delivers Message</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 26th] Today marks the first anniversary of the opening of the San Francisco Conference. The U.S. government held a special banquet to entertain all representatives of the United Nations Security Council, and President Truman's message was read on the spot, stating: "A year ago today, nations began building institutions during the war to maintain unity after peace, which is a day worth commemorating. A year ago, this organization was just a hope; today, it has become a reality. The United Nations General Assembly, the Security Council, and the Economic and Social Council were all unrealized ideals a year ago, but today they are all active institutions.

<h3>Churchill's Speech: The World is Seriously Ill; All Humanity is Suffering from Confusion and Pain: Victors and Vanquished Alike</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Aberdeen, 27th] Churchill said in a speech here today: "The world is now seriously ill, full of mutual hatred. All humanity is suffering from confusion and pain, victors and vanquished alike. The two terrible wars we have experienced in our lifetime have torn apart the heart of love and culture. The 'Christian civilization' of the 19th century is now almost completely destroyed, but science is advancing, which is driven by war. Science in the hands of the masses has surpassed the development of reason, and humanity's spiritual capacity has also been exhausted, leading to bloodshed. Therefore, there is an urgent need for a period of recovery; humanity cannot withstand further blows in its current state."</p>
<h3>Soviets Actively Dismantling Factories in German Occupied Zone; No Fewer Than 170 Factories Dismantled; Factory Owner Tried to Flatter Soviets, Was Taken Away</h3>
<p>[United Press International, Berlin, 26th] The Soviet Union continues to dismantle factories in the German occupied zone, which is currently in full swing. According to estimates by the Industrial Management Office of the occupied zone, no fewer than 160 to 172 factories have been dismantled recently. The Walfen factory in Saxony, which supplied colored film to the Soviet occupation authorities to capture footage of the victory parade in Moscow, was immediately ordered to have its machinery dismantled and moved to the Soviet Union due to its excellent work. A paper mill in Neugalis, Mecklenburg, specializing in the production of high-quality thick paper for certificates and scrolls, has also been instructed by the Soviet Union to have its troops dismantle and relocate it. The factory owner, who also serves as the mayor, was quick-witted and declared to the Soviet army that the factory's equipment was outdated and that he would personally go to Leningrad to build a modern new paper mill for them. The Soviet military commander reported this to his superiors, who replied: "The person can be brought along as well, and a new factory can be built later." The Horch automobile factory in Saxony, which manufactures high-end automobiles, is currently dismantling its machinery in preparation for transportation to the Soviet Union. In addition, the sixteen largest paper mills in the Soviet occupied zone are being dismantled and transported eastward. According to orders, half of the equipment from Germany's largest nitrogen plant near Morsenburg will be en route to the Soviet Union by May 15th. According to experts, the factory's machinery and equipment are exceptionally complex and will take two years to completely dismantle. The Soviet Union's dismantling of these factories should be explained by stating that the Potsdam Agreement guarantees the Soviet Union 15% of the industrial equipment from the western occupied zones of Germany, but it is difficult to wait for an agreement to be established with other related countries. Other related countries have different views on what is "necessary for Germany's peacetime economy" than the Soviet Union. Therefore, if they do not concede to the Soviet Union's demands for certain factories, a four-country expert committee will carefully examine German industry to determine compensation issues. This is another reason why the Soviet Union is eager to dismantle German factories because once they are dismantled, the committee cannot include them in the compensation plan.</p>
<h3>Indian Congress Party President Acharya Decides to Retire; Nehru Nominated to Succeed as President; Anglo-Indian Negotiations to Reopen Soon</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, New Delhi, 26th] The President of the Indian National Congress Party, Acharya, recently told the press that he has decided to retire and has nominated Nehru to succeed as president. The Congress Party's National Executive Committee will hold a meeting in May and has included the retirement of President Acharya on the agenda. This move is sufficient to promote Nehru's early assumption of the presidency. Appointing a Hindu as the president of the National Congress Party is of great significance. The reason for this is that Muslim leader Jinnah is unwilling to associate with Acharya. (Note: The Congress Party is mostly composed of Hindus and claims to represent all the people of India. Therefore, in the last election, they chose the Muslim Acharya as president to show impartiality).</p>
<p>[Reuters, New Delhi, 27th] The British Cabinet delegation will do everything possible to unite the various parties in India and form a provisional government to achieve a preliminary resolution of the Indian issue. Therefore, today, they invited the Speaker of the Indian National Assembly and the President of the Muslim League to nominate representatives to continue negotiations with the British delegation.</p>
<h3>Coalition Negotiations Between Japan's Liberal and Socialist Parties Break Down; Socialist Party Insists on Taking Premiership; Opportunity for Shidehara to Make a Comeback Increases</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Tokyo Correspondent, 27th] Last night, the committee of the Liberal, Socialist, Cooperative, and Communist parties held a meeting to discuss forming a coalition government. The debate lasted for two hours without any results because the Socialist Party still wanted to hold the position of Prime Minister in the new cabinet, while the Liberal Party firmly opposed it. At 1:00 PM today, Socialist Party leader Katayama visited Liberal Party leader Hatoyama and discussed it again for an hour and twenty minutes. Immediately afterward, he held a press conference and admitted that the negotiations had failed. The leaders of the various parties will visit Shidehara tomorrow to discuss everything. It is the first time that the cabinet has been so difficult to produce.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Tokyo, 27th] Japanese Progressive Party leader Nakai said that since cooperation between the Liberal Party and the Socialist Party is impossible, the opportunity for Shidehara to make a comeback has greatly increased. He smiled as he said this.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Tokyo, 27th] General observation suggests that Liberal Party Foreign Minister Yoshida may be appointed as the new Prime Minister.</p>

<h3>International Bank to Issue First Public Bonds Within Six Months; May Be Traded in Foreign Commercial Centers</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, New York, 26th] The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development may issue its first public bonds within six months, which are expected to be eagerly sought after. Although international bank bonds are very different from ordinary public bonds, they will also be registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Savings banks and trust companies in New York have been authorized to use these public bonds as investments. A total of 38 countries are participating in the International Bank, but the amounts subscribed by each country cannot be paid up immediately because the amount collected each time cannot exceed 20% of the total amount subscribed by each country of 9.1 billion. Therefore, the bank must issue public bonds to obtain the necessary funds to help countries affected by the war undertake reconstruction work. According to Lo Chaim, a foreign investment consultant for the Securities and Exchange Commission, international bank bonds may be traded on securities exchanges and other foreign commercial centers. It is expected that the bank will first issue smaller denomination bonds of 10,000 each to test the purchasing situation before issuing larger denomination bonds.</p>

<h3>Young Jewish Girls are Cold-Blooded Killers; Fighting to the Death for Immigration Goals</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Jerusalem, 27th] A "New York Times" reporter claims that over a dozen teenage girls have been discovered in Palestine participating in terrorist activities. These girls charge into battle and kill without blinking an eye, making the killing monsters in American movies seem inferior. These girls were among those who attacked the Sixth Airborne Division's parking lot on Thursday night. As early as January, a teenage Jewish girl, Braha Fult, died while participating in an attack on the Sharona police station. Thousands of Jewish youths, many of whom were teenage girls, attended her funeral on Thursday morning. They held up banners praising the deceased as "fighters for immigration." Before the tomb, these thousands of young people swore to follow in the footsteps of the deceased, convinced that Jewish immigration is a legitimate goal and that they should not hesitate to sacrifice their lives to achieve it. That evening, a large-scale attack on the paratrooper station occurred.</p>
<h3>Watching American Veterans in the Streets of New York (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent for Ding Bao in the United States, Mao Shuqing</p>
<p>I asked a newly acquainted friend in the city government if New York was short of housing because the soldiers had all returned. He said, "It has something to do with it, but not entirely. Most of the veterans are sent back to their hometowns according to their original addresses," and didn't stay in New York. "And some of them have entered universities across the country"!</p>
<p>According to the American soldiers' rights petition, the government has a responsibility to fulfill the wishes of soldiers who volunteer to pursue further education after being discharged. As a result, universities across the United States are now experiencing problems with too many students and insufficient capacity. Near Columbia University in New York, you can still see college students in military uniforms carrying books walking around, and many are living in on-campus dormitories. Ohio State University recently admitted two hundred disabled honorably discharged soldiers, who live in the army hospital and go to school on time during the day. One of them even had both legs broken. They can't go to physical training or participate in various school activities. The New York Times recently issued a call, believing that the massive influx of soldiers into schools would increase the difficulty of educational administration, and urged the demobilization authorities to find ways to improve the situation.</p>
<p>Demobilizing more than ten million soldiers is not an easy task. General Brett Law, who had traveled through Europe, was appointed head of the demobilization effort and is vigorously removing all obstacles. Looking at the general situation in New York, very few veterans are wandering around unemployed. During my journey on the Atlantic ship, I participated in the entertainment of their officers and soldiers. The demobilization authorities used films to issue notices on how to fill out volunteer forms, distribute or introduce jobs. The U.S. government has made a firm determination to do this, believing that if this matter is not handled well, it will be a collective shame for the country.</p>
<p>In the United States, unemployment and labor strikes are two different things. If the unemployment problem becomes serious, it will lead to social unrest. Although worker strikes can also reduce production, in a country with highly developed capitalism, "labor strikes" are common, especially after a war has just ended. Many mines in the United States worked five hours a day before the war and increased production to eight hours during the war, with wages naturally increasing as well. Now that the war is over, they have to return to five hours of work a day, and the workers hope not to reduce wages or even increase wages, because general prices have increased compared to the past. Most of the mine owners agree to increase wages, but the differences between them have become the source of labor strikes. At the same time, American labor strikes are by no means riots. They have democratic training, strong collective organizations, and the most powerful ones, such as the National Federation of Labor C.I.O., etc. Recently, the chairman of the labor union, Lewis, gave a speech to workers in Washington, particularly criticizing the "politicization" of labor unions. He said that American labor unions have no political party affiliation and will never be the tail of any political party. "Some people regard us as sponsors of the Communist Party, which is a big mistake."</p>
<p>Recently, the American coal mine labor strike is unfolding. Four hundred thousand "soft coal" workers in the states of Virginia, Pennsylvania, Kentucky, and Kansas have stopped working, waiting for their labor union to negotiate with the authorities. Negotiations are being held in Washington, and the demands of the Coal Workers Union are: (1) Increase mine safety equipment; (2) Mine owners should allocate one cent per ton of coal to a worker welfare fund; (3) The fifty-four-hour work week should be changed to thirty-five hours without reducing salaries. After the demands were made, the government dispatched Paul Ford to serve as an arbitrator. The capitalists believe that the first point can be improved at any time by hiring top-notch engineers and technical experts for inspection and improvement. If the second point is implemented, the capitalists will lose $60 million annually, which is too much. The third point, working hours, can be considered.</p>
<p>Coal is a daily necessity and a major fuel for heavy industry. Therefore, the stagnation of coal production will affect the whole situation. According to estimates by the New York Times, the current coal reserves in New York and nearby areas are sufficient for four to six weeks, but the impact on the steel industry is significant. The largest steel company in Pittsburgh is preparing to reduce its production by 47% to cope with the fuel shortage.</p>
<p>I use the coal mine situation as an example to illustrate that many light and heavy industries in the United States are now out of sync in the transition from war to peace. This is an inevitable phenomenon. It is by no means an easy task for such a large country to mobilize more than ten million people and tens of millions of tons of materials to fight in the Pacific and Europe. What may be even more unbelievable is that butter and white sugar are still not available in New York City. In the American military camps in various parts of Europe, I saw mountains of butter shipped from the United States. However, when you get to New York and eat at a restaurant, there is no butter. "Americans are not just a nation that knows how to enjoy themselves." They have sacrificed everything for the war.</p>
<p>Of course, no matter how you look at it, Americans are still the happiest group in the world. They jump, shout, and make noise without worry or trouble. Especially in New York, the five largest cinemas, music halls, the National Theater, and Roxy Theater are filled with tens of thousands of people every day, from early morning to late at night. On Saturdays and Sundays, they are even open twenty-four hours a day. When a new film from Hollywood comes to New York, you have to queue up to buy tickets. For a little over a dollar, you can watch a movie and a song and dance show. It seems that these millions of New Yorkers spend more time playing and less time working. This kind of enjoyment cannot be seen or found in Europe. Once, the Roxy Theater was showing a newsreel, and the former New York Mayor LaGuardia was serving as the director of the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration. When his picture appeared, the "New Yorkers" in the audience laughed. Every time LaGuardia gave his inaugural speech, the audience would burst into laughter, just like middle school students watching their homeroom teacher perform on stage. LaGuardia had been the parent of their seven million people and had also been their homeroom teacher. Who says democratic politics are not lovely? The loveliness of democratic politics lies here. (The End) (Mailed on April 10)</p>

<h3>Electing the Wise and Capable, Participating Enthusiastically - Commander Shen Prudently Handles Affairs, Legal Election - Mayor Qian Broadcasts on the Eve of the Election</h3>
<p>Mayor Qian Dajun delivered a broadcast speech last night, expressing three points of expectation for this election to the people of all walks of life in the city: (1) To be a citizen of a democratic country, the first condition is to be enthusiastic about politics, and the main manifestation of enthusiasm for politics is to actively participate in elections. Participation in elections is a duty that every citizen should fulfill, at least a basic duty. Only when every citizen is happy to assume this duty can we become a truly democratic country. (2) When we participate in elections, we should not just casually cast a vote and be done with it. We should carefully consider the candidates before writing their names. The ancients said that "the great way prevails" depends on "electing the wise and appointing the capable." The wise are those with morality, and the capable are those with ability. Only those who possess both morality and ability are worthy of being our representatives. Election is both a duty and a right. We should not give up this right, nor should we use this right casually. (3) Democratic politics and the law have an inseparable relationship. Without the rule of law, we cannot have democracy. During the election, everyone should compete enthusiastically, but all actions must be legal, and there must be no actions outside the law. Using methods outside the law to compete will not only be subject to legal sanctions, but will also have no effect. Even if one is fortunate enough to be elected, it is a dishonorable victory, an inglorious victory. On the eve of this election, I hope for the efforts of fellow compatriots from all walks of life, and at the same time, I wish our first municipal councilor election a complete success.</p>
<h3>The Jiang Gongmei Case is Expected to Be Sentenced in Three Days - Martial Law Not Yet Lifted - Commander Li Attends Press Conference to Report</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Li Jilan, Commander of the Songhu Garrison Command, attended a press conference at the Municipal Government Information Office yesterday afternoon to report on and answer questions regarding the city's public security. Regarding the reasons why the curfew has not been lifted, Commander Li stated that the military force is not yet fully equipped, transportation has not yet been restored, and theft cases in the city are emerging one after another. For the sake of the safety of the lives and property of the entire citizenry, it cannot be lifted for the time being, especially since May is a time of many incidents, and prevention should be strengthened. However, various conveniences have been provided for the night work of a few people.</p>
<p>Jiang Gongyi was arrested by the Garrison Command on October 13 of last year. The entire case was handed over to the Chongqing Military Police Headquarters. After consulting the Supreme Standing Committee of the Military Affairs Commission, the Garrison Command was ordered to try the case. The command and the Army Headquarters and the Military Police Headquarters immediately sent personnel to jointly hear the case. After the trial was completed, the presiding officer, Li Shenzhi, a senior advisor to the Army Headquarters, declared Jiang not guilty. All sectors of society and Commander Qian considered this verdict inappropriate, so they requested instructions from the authorities again and were ordered to review the case and return the prisoner. The case is expected to be decided in three days, and the Military Affairs Commission will still be requested to review it after the verdict is announced.</p>
<p>Commander Li stated that he would do his best to deal with the occasional theft cases and military robberies in this city, and would impose severe penalties upon confirmation. However, it is inevitable that some people impersonate soldiers to undermine the central government and blame central government agencies through conspiratorial means, causing citizens to become suspicious; and that deserters and miscellaneous soldiers endanger local public security, and will be severely punished according to law when found. Military police stationed in houses in the Hongkou area can be reported and punished if they waste residents' water and electricity, thereby increasing the burden.</p>
<p>In the case of Japanese national Yutaka Tsuchida, an order was received from the central government that he must be severely punished because he was related to Murakami, a secretary of the Japanese intelligence department. Tsuchida was the mastermind behind Murakami's activities. After interrogation by the Garrison Command, he was handed over to the military court for war crimes processing. The Songhu Garrison Command is the highest military justice organ in Songhu and has the power to arrest war criminals. No other agency may interfere except the central government.</p>
<h3>After the Livestock Market Closed - The Problem of Employees Not Resolved</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] After the livestock market in this city was ordered to close, all employees formed a post-liquidation committee and petitioned the municipal government and the Social Affairs Bureau. Yesterday, they also hosted reporters from various newspapers at the Kesilin Pharmacy to report on the process and said they hoped that the market would provide reasonable arrangements to ensure their future.</p>
<h3>Public Trial of Two Officials - Xie Zhongfu and Gong Were Driven By Life - Xu Jidun Said He Helped the War of Resistance</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Xie Zhongfu and Xu Jidun were interrogated yesterday morning at the High Court by Judge Qiu Huan-ying. The former defendant was short and fat, with a crew cut, wearing a blue cloth robe; the latter was lanky, with hair, wearing a striped cloth robe. Their families all hired lawyers to defend them.</p>
<p>Xie Zhongfu</p>
<p>Testified: 49 years old, from Meixian County, Guangdong Province. Before 1936, he served as a member of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission. He resigned in the second half of 1936. He joined the puppet organization in April 1940. He was introduced by Chu Minyi to serve as a standing member of the Puppet Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission. The chairman was Chen Jicheng. However, at that time, the puppet decrees could not leave the country, so the association basically had nothing to do. Meetings were rarely held, and when they were held, they only discussed personnel matters. Therefore, this position was equivalent to holding a position without doing any work. In February 1943, the association was abolished at the same time as the Puppet Frontier Committee. In August 1944, he was transferred to the position of Puppet Administrative Inspector, which also had no practical work. Moreover, the work of "cleaning up the countryside" had already come to an end, so he did not hear about it in advance. In May 1945, he went to Zhejiang with Ding Mocun to serve as the Puppet Minister of Education, but he only served for three months before the victory. The defendant has never made any speeches, broadcasts, articles, or communications with overseas countries during his tenure in various puppet positions. He took up puppet positions because he was in economic difficulty at the time, with an elderly father and seven or eight family members to support, and was driven by life. Now that he is imprisoned, his blood pressure is very high and he suffers from hearing loss, so he asked the court to investigate and declare him not guilty. Tears were in his eyes as he spoke, and he was unable to finish his words in grief.</p>
<p>Xu Jidun</p>
<p>50 years old, from Gaoyou. According to his testimony: He worked at the Provincial Yangzhou Middle School 28 years ago. Later, he was arrested by "76" for preparing to publish a publication with the subordinates of Ma Yuanfang, then Director of the Jiangsu Education Department, and was coerced into joining the puppet organization. However, the Puppet General Education Department was an agency exclusively in charge of primary and secondary school education. The preparation of textbooks was handled by a separate editorial office. The defendant once suggested to Zhao Zhengping, the then Puppet Minister of Education, that the changes in the school system during the Renovation Government era, the employment of Japanese consultants, the failure to teach the Three Principles of the People, and the failure to hang a portrait of Sun Yat-sen, and the change of the citizenship course to a moral education course should be corrected. Regarding the addition of Japanese language instruction, it was agreed at the time that "primary schools should not teach foreign languages" in principle. During his tenure as Minister of Education in Zhejiang, the work of "cleaning up the countryside" was a mere formality and was actually a political tool. As the Puppet Director of Construction in Shanghai, water and electricity were managed by the enemy China Water and Electricity Company, so there was nothing else to do other than vehicle registration. The defendant worked hard to reduce illiteracy, stabilize the lives of teachers, restore schools, and protect teachers and students traveling to the rear, all of which were beneficial to the people, which can be investigated by the court. During the trial, Judge Qiu suddenly asked the defendant whether he approved of the Nanjing government. Xu was stunned for a long time and could not speak fluently. Finally, he replied: On the surface, it seems that they all have some reason, but I dare not judge whether it is merit or demerit. And my intention to participate was only to do something to indirectly help the War of Resistance. The court argued the above two cases and adjourned for another hearing, and the defendants were returned to custody.</p>

<h3>Three Major Obstacles to Chinese Tea Exports - Costs are Too High and No One Will Ask - Must Be Jointly Operated with Collective Power</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Shou Yicheng, chairman of the China Tea Association, told reporters: There are currently three major obstacles to Chinese tea export trade: (1) The price issue. Currently, tea farmers calculate tea prices based on rice prices. If grain prices are high and tea prices are low, tea farmers will not pick tea leaves because there is no profit. Therefore, rice prices and tea prices are implicitly linked. (2) The freight issue. Domestic transportation is difficult, and freight rates are high. (3) The interest rate issue. Currently, domestic interest rates are high. Even for the tea loans in the Southeast tea-producing areas that were recently established, the monthly interest rate is four and a half points, plus a handling fee of one and a half points, for a total monthly interest rate of six points. Before the war, tea loans were only 7% to 8% per year. In the recent situation in Japan, the annual interest rate is only 2%. This time, tea loans in Zhejiang, Anhui, and Jiangxi provinces totaled 7 billion yuan. This is of great importance to the restoration of the rural economy after the war. According to the planned plan, this year PingShui area in Zhejiang Province can produce 160,000 boxes of tea; Suichun area can produce 35,000 boxes of tea; Wenzhou area can produce 20,000 boxes of tea. Tunxi area in Anhui Province can produce 120,000 boxes of tea; Qimen area can produce 75,000 boxes of tea. Ningzhou area in Jiangxi Province can produce 40,000 boxes of tea, and Gandong area can produce 10,000 boxes of tea. In addition, Fujian Province can produce about 140,000 boxes of tea; Hunan and Hubei provinces can produce about 300,000 boxes of tea; the total is about 900,000 boxes. However, now that there is production, it is necessary to further prepare for its export steps. Judging from the current world tea production and sales situation, Japan's tea production has decreased by 50% compared to before the war due to the impact of the war, while China's has decreased by only 30%, which is a good opportunity to catch up quickly. Moreover, the United States originally had a commercial agreement with the United Kingdom to purchase tea from India and Ceylon, but it has now announced that it will not renew it. Therefore, Americans deeply hope to buy more Chinese tea. Moreover, during this war, more than 6 million American soldiers have traveled to China, India, and the Philippines. This group of soldiers is accustomed to drinking tea due to the lack of coffee drinks. After returning to the United States, they praised the beauty of Chinese tea and promoted our Chinese black and green tea as a free advertisement. Therefore, our Chinese black and green tea does not have to worry about a sales market in the United States. However, in the past, China's largest market for green tea was North Africa, the largest market for Qimen black tea was the British Isles, and tea bricks were mostly sold to the Soviet Union. In the early days of the War of Resistance, 70% of Chinese tea was transported to Russia for barter. Therefore, the export should have a precise plan and tidy steps to seek long-term development. Reducing production costs is the most important thing. For example, the US market price of Qimen black tea is only 50 cents per pound. Although it has recently risen to 57 cents, the cost of selling Chinese Qimen black tea to the United States is at least about one US dollar per pound, a difference of up to one time. Therefore, even if countries are willing to purchase it, it will be difficult for people to ask because of the high price. Mr. Shou believes that to reduce production costs, first, domestic tea merchants must unite and organize the China Tea Export Trading Corporation. Using collective power, the same steps, and joint operations, concentrate transportation and sales. On the one hand, recruit experts and purchase new machines, use scientific methods, establish experimental farms and refined tea factories to mass-produce fine tea. On the other hand, I hope the government will have an unwavering national policy for the tea industry across the country, so that tea merchants and tea farmers have something to follow in terms of production and sales, and move towards a sound and planned production path.</p>
<h3>Effective May 1st, Telephone Progressive Billing Introduced, Hoping Citizens Will Use Restraint</h3>
<p>The American Shanghai Telephone Company, due to equipment limitations, has not only been unable to universally supply telephone installations to citizens, but its daily connections are also experiencing delays due to traffic congestion. Recognizing this, the Public Utilities Bureau has repeatedly instructed improvements, on one hand urging the company to make appropriate adjustments to existing equipment, and on the other hand, urging it to quickly order equipment from the United States for expansion. It is reported that equipment sufficient for 10,000 user lines is already on order. However, in the current global environment of material scarcity, the completion of this plan within a short period is unlikely. Currently, the company's users are using the telephone exceptionally frequently, with an average of 10.6 calls per line per day, exceeding the machine capacity by 40%. During the period when expansion equipment cannot be realized, the company has requested the adoption of a progressive billing system to improve connection speed. After careful study by the Public Utilities Bureau, considering the company's revenue and expenditure situation, based on the normal needs of users, and taking into account the burden on the general public, the progressive method has been approved and submitted to the Municipal Government for approval, and will be implemented from May 1st. The basic telephone fee will only increase by 70% to 100%, and the excess over the basic number of calls will be charged progressively, with each 100 calls as a level. The charges are as follows: monthly calls below 100 will be charged at 25 yuan per call; 101 to 200 calls at 50 yuan per call; 201 to 300 calls at 100 yuan per call; 301 to 400 calls at 150 yuan per call; and over 400 calls at 200 yuan per call. It is hoped that citizens will reduce unnecessary calls to reduce the burden on the equipment, so that traffic can be expected to be smooth, and there may be a surplus to provide for the normal application of citizens. In this way, the efficiency of the telephone service will gradually improve.</p>
<h3>Six Robberies in Less Than Two Months, Four Arch-Robbers Sentenced to Death, Executed by Firing Squad Yesterday on Song Park Road</h3>
<p>[Reported by Our Newspaper] The four arch-robbers Cai Defang, Gao Hongfei, Ji Amao, and Lu Xiankang, etc., after being captured by the police in the Haidongchun Inn on Guangxi Road, were sent to the Songhu Garrison Headquarters Military Law Office for interrogation. They confessed to armed robberies at the following locations: (1) No. 5 Huashengfang, Jinmen Street, at 7:00 PM on January 18th; (2) No. 2 Chongqing Road, Tongyuan Pawnshop, at 3:00 AM on February 10th; (3) No. 319, Lane 568, Xinzha Road, at 10:00 AM on the 17th of the same month; (4) No. 1, Lane 199, Chongde Road, at 7:00 PM on the 27th of the same month; (5) No. 10, Lane 28, South Sichuan Road, at 5:00 PM on March 9th; (6) The home of Wang Ronglin, No. 69, Lane 69, Anfu Road, at 4:30 PM on the 12th of the same month. After summoning the victims to court for identification, the court considered that the criminals dared to commit six consecutive armed robberies in 53 days, which was extremely heinous. According to the Regulations on the Punishment of Bandits, they were sentenced to death. The sentence was approved by the superiors and executed by firing squad at 10:00 AM yesterday on Song Park Road.</p>
<h3>City Hospital Association Discusses Salary Issues</h3>
<p>The Shanghai City Hospital Association held an emergency meeting at Hongren Hospital yesterday afternoon at 6:30 PM. The attending hospitals included Zhu Hengbi from the Red Cross Hospital, Gu Gengmei from Dagong Hospital, Jin Xiezhang from Dahua Hospital, and Wang Yijing from Hongren Hospital, totaling more than 40 people. The meeting discussed issues related to the salaries of doctors and nurses.

<h3>Six-Year-Old Girl Dies of Illness, Doctor Huang Nan Accused</h3>
<p>[Reported by Our Newspaper] Cao Miaoying, a six-year-old girl from Xuzhou, was the only daughter of Cao Xuewen, the general affairs officer of the Changshu Road Police Station. She fell ill on the 25th of last month and was sent to Nanyang Hospital on Jinling West Road on the 28th, where she was diagnosed and treated by Dr. Huang Nan of the pediatrics department. An X-ray was immediately taken, and it was said that she might have typhoid fever, so she was ordered to be hospitalized. Blood was drawn as many as 14 times, but there was no improvement. On the 11th of this month, another X-ray was taken, and it was said to be tuberculosis. Later, Cao took her to Feng Zijun, a tuberculosis expert, for treatment. Feng said it was too late and that there would have been no problem if she had come a week earlier. Cao's child died at Nanyang Hospital on the morning of the 22nd. Cao Xuewen believes that his beloved daughter died unjustly. In addition to requesting the court to examine the body, he filed a complaint with the District Prosecutor's Office on the 23rd of this month against Huang Nan.</p>
<h3>The Dike of Jiangyin, Changshu, and Nantong is in Danger, Fellow Townsmen in Shanghai Plan Rescue</h3>
<p>Changyinsha, under the jurisdiction of Jiangyin, Changshu, and Nantong counties, faces the Yangtze River. It has been occupied for eight years, and the seawall project has suffered considerable damage. At this time of rising spring water and approaching summer tides, the area along the river is in danger of submergence, and tens of thousands of victims are terrified all day long. Therefore, representatives were sent to Shanghai a few days ago to appeal to all sectors for relief. The fellow townsmen from the three counties in Shanghai initiated the organization of the Jiangchangtong Seawall Engineering Committee to plan rescue efforts. The inaugural meeting was held at the Atlantic Vegetable Society. Ji Chen Shi Quan, Feng Youju, Wu Shouying, and other nine people were elected as executive members to preside over the affairs and actively proceed. According to experts, the entire project requires as much as 3.5 billion yuan.</p>
<h3>Glimpses from an Aerial Tour: A Brief Stop on West Lake</h3>
<p>— Our Reporter, Mai Tian, Shou Mu</p>
<p>I remember that before the War of Resistance, the Eurasia Aviation Corporation once invited the press to take a city flight, but it was never as grand and exciting as yesterday's invitation from the Central Air Transport Corporation—taking us from Shanghai through Taihu Lake to West Lake, and then back from West Lake. This aerial trip, especially in the late spring season, with a vast expanse of spring scenery in the south of the Yangtze River, is truly captivating.</p>
<p>At 8:30 yesterday morning, the reporter arrived in front of the Municipal Government, ready to wait for the airline's truck to take me to the airport. I thought there was another group petitioning. As a result, I saw that the big crowd of people were all planning to "fly." Each signed reporter could also bring a friend, so it's no wonder everyone was scrambling for the opportunity. The gentleman issuing the tickets was running east and west, jumping up and down, covered in sweat. It took three hours to issue all the tickets.</p>
<p>One hundred and several dozen people were divided into three batches to tour. The first batch of people, at 9:40, took the company's 19th C46 type straw-yellow transport plane, which can carry six tons, and departed from Longhua. Chen Wenkuan, the head of the flight crew, personally piloted the plane. Next to him sat a foreign assistant who could speak fluent Mandarin. Mr. Chen's piloting skills are very high. It is said that when he was fighting in the Myanmar area, he transported military supplies and materials, making as many as six round trips every day. This kind of hard and enduring work is not easy.</p>
<p>After the plane took off, it circled the city once and then flew along the Jinghu Line. It took only 20 minutes to reach Taihu Lake. From Taihu Lake to West Lake, the weather turned bad, so the fuselage vibrated, sometimes high and sometimes low. Many of the passengers vomited. After flying in the clouds for about 15 minutes, the fuselage slowly descended. At this time, we had reached the sky above West Lake, and we vaguely admired the beauty of West Lake, which was not in vain for this trip.</p>
<p>The first batch returned to Shanghai at 11:20. Ten minutes later, the second batch took off on the same plane, but this time they were at a disadvantage, as they could only fly a circle near Shanghai. But from inside the plane, overlooking this largest city in the East, the paddy fields were clearly visible and very beautiful. The buildings were arranged as if they were very orderly, and the green fields in the wilderness were even more beautiful and lovely. The large warships in the Huangpu River had become shoes at this time; the trains moved no differently than earthworms on the ground. Oxygen was provided in the plane, and after flying for 40 minutes, everyone gradually got hot. Several guests couldn't stand it anymore, and it was time to rest after returning.</p>
<p>The enthusiasm of the third batch of people did not diminish. It was almost time for lunch, but they still wanted to go up. So they changed to another plane. After everyone's unanimous request, the pilot was unwilling to spoil the fun, and finally circled above Hangzhou and brought everyone back when it was past 2 o'clock.</p>
<h3>Death of Mr. Chen Taoyi, Promoting Revolution for Decades as One Day, Steadfastly Serving the Local Area</h3>
<p>[Reported by Our Newspaper] Mr. Chen Taoyi of Jinshan [see picture], aged 66, passed away at 11:30 AM yesterday at his residence, No. 12 Zelin Place, Hed Road, Shanghai. When the news of his death spread, all of Mr. Chen's friends mourned in unison. The funeral is now scheduled for 4:00 PM tomorrow at the World Funeral Home. Mr. Chen was a talented scholar in the late Qing Dynasty. When the revolutionary wind arose, he sold his family property and went to Waseda University in Japan to study political economy, and joined the Tongmenghui. Soon after the assassination group was established, Mr. Chen served as the deputy leader and was dispatched back to China to work. Due to the secrecy of the matter, when the ship arrived at the Wusongkou, he was ordered by Liangjiang Governor Duanfang to be detained and sent to Beijing by the Shanghai Daotai. Fortunately, he was released a year before the Xinhai Revolution after Zhang Sai's strong guarantee. He then went to various parts of Southeast Asia to promote the revolution, and served as the Jiangsu Branch President of the Kuomintang. During the presidential election, he served as the Jiangsu representative and the vice chairman of the Provisional Senate. After the failure of the Second Revolution, he withdrew from party and government affairs and went to the three northeastern provinces to organize the Dongjing Company to engage in land reclamation. When Sun Chuanfang served as the governor of five provinces, he was shocked by Mr. Chen's prestige and repeatedly invited him to become the head of Jiangsu Province. During the Northern Expedition, Zhang Qun, the current chairman of Sichuan Province, was ordered to contact Mr. Chen to persuade Sun to revolt, but due to the obstruction of the chief of staff, the purpose was not achieved. Mr. Chen also took this opportunity to retire and return to his countryside. Chen Min and the late owner of this newspaper, Mr. Shi Liangcai, were close friends, so he did his best for this newspaper. Later, when Mr. Shi became the head of the local association in this city, Mr. Chen served as the secretary-general. During the period when this city was occupied, the rebels also invited him several times to become afraid of Jiangsu Province, but he declined on the grounds of illness. Mr. Chen often said to his sons, Duanbai and Xiubai: "I only wish to have a clean body, wealth and honor are not what we seek." Mr. Chen contracted tuberculosis ten years ago, but gradually recovered with the careful treatment of his eldest son. Two years ago, he contracted bronchiectasis, which caused persistent asthma. Recently, his heart weakened and his blood circulation was also abnormal. From the 15th of this month, his breathing was short, and his blood pressure dropped and his blood vessels bled the day before yesterday. He passed away suddenly at 11:30 AM yesterday.</p>
<h3>Three Traitors Sentenced to Imprisonment, Four Cases Debate Concluded</h3>
<p>[Reported by Our Newspaper] Zhang Suxing, who once served as the head of the puppet anti-smoking bureau, was sentenced by the High Court yesterday. The main text: Conspiring with enemy countries, plotting to rebel against one's own country, sentenced to three years of imprisonment, deprivation of public rights for three years. Also, the cases of Xu Jichuan and Xu Yuanlai, suspected of being traitors, were also adjudicated. Xu Jichuan was sentenced to three years of imprisonment, deprivation of public rights for three years, and Xu Yuanlai was sentenced to two years and six months of imprisonment, deprivation of public rights for two years. All the property of the above defendants will be confiscated, except for the necessary living expenses for their families. On the same day, the collegiate panel concluded the debate on four cases, namely (1) the Hong Ting case, (2) the Zhu Jiutian case, and (3) the Gu Yousheng case, all scheduled for sentencing on the 30th. (4) The Deng Xiugao and Deng Dingquan case is scheduled for sentencing on May 3rd.</p>
<p>Also, Lin Kangsi, one of the "Three Elders", was interrogated by the High Procuratorate yesterday. Among those questioned on the same day were Sun Shaokang, Zhang Guangdou, and Wang Zhisan, among others.</p>
<h3>Two People Killed by Cars, Minister Zhu's Car Causes Accident, Drunk American Soldier Causes Trouble Again</h3>
<p>[Reported by Our Newspaper] At about 9:00 AM yesterday, a 20-year-old pedestrian was hit by a car on Henan Road, suffering a head injury. He was sent to Renji Hospital for treatment by the police, but died at noon. According to sources, the car belongs to Minister of Education Zhu.</p>
<p>[Reported by Our Newspaper] At the intersection of Aidaiming Road and Yuanfang Road, at 8:30 PM last night, an American-style small jeep carrying four American soldiers, all excessively drunk, was shouting along the way. At that time, there was a heavy rain, and many people were waiting at the tram station. Unexpectedly, the American soldiers driving the car did not follow the road and crashed into the crowd. One person was knocked down and killed, and the jeep sped away.</p>
<h3>Shangxian Women and Children's Hospital Actively Resumes Operations</h3>
<p>Shangxian Women and Children's Hospital has been serving general poor women and children for 20 years, with outstanding achievements. It has been renting the building at No. 11 Dumei Road as the hospital site. However, after the victory of the War of Resistance, the owner took back the building, so it had to move out. But due to the large number of patients, the diagnosis and treatment work could not be suspended, so an outpatient department was still set up at No. 12 Yingshi Road, and hospitalized patients were temporarily housed in Renhe Hospital. Later, the Christian Hongde Church was willing to lend its church building to the hospital. Unfortunately, the repair costs were too high, so it could not become a reality. Now, Mr. Ward, a British man, is willing to rent several buildings along the road on Tanggu Road, which he owns, to the hospital unconditionally, which is admirable. It is reported that the hospital's board of directors will actively raise funds to repair them so that the hospital can resume operations as soon as possible.</p>

<h3>Facing Internal and External Situations Alone: Truman's Heavy Responsibilities and Power</h3>
<p>"A former President of the United States will never congratulate a friend who is elected President!"</p>
<p>This was said by John Adams, the second President of the United States of North America, when his son, Quincy Adams, was also elected President. This happened more than a hundred years ago. From then until the 20th century, the position of President of the United States has consistently been one of the most burdensome and responsible positions in the world.</p>
<p>Truman - A Recent Portrait</p>
<p>Unparalleled Power and Responsibility</p>
<p>The United States, a powerful nation with a population of 140 million, places the ultimate responsibility for its actions on the shoulders of the President. The President also bears the final responsibility for the United States' relations with other countries. He (the President) is the head of the government, with the power to lead his party and resolve domestic crises and disputes. He is responsible for handling foreign affairs, meaning that international matters are decided by him. He has the power to appoint officials of all ranks. His ability to fulfill these significant missions relies entirely on the presidential authority he possesses, which is rarely granted to heads of state in other countries.</p>
<p>Struggling to Manage: Extremely Difficult</p>
<p>In fact, the US President is not solely responsible for his actions. His actions only need to be passed by either the Senate or the House of Representatives to become legally binding. This is the opposite of other republican countries and can be said to be different. In American history, there have been several presidents who faced a situation where the Senate and House of Representatives were filled with seats held by the opposition party. In other words, the president had to manage government affairs and rule the country under the constraints of the two houses, which were in an adversarial position. For example, President Roosevelt (Note: There were two Roosevelts in American history, from the same family, but separate in time. The older Roosevelt was named Theodore Roosevelt. Here, we are talking about Franklin D. Roosevelt, who was elected for four terms and made great achievements for world peace and human happiness. When the United States first became independent, its second president, Washington, stipulated that presidents could not serve more than two consecutive terms. This was a good traditional practice to prevent dictatorship and adhere to democratic principles. President Roosevelt's multiple consecutive terms were entirely an exception in American history, thus fully demonstrating his achievements and popularity.) and President Hoover before him were examples. President Hoover was a Republican, and within two years of his presidency, the majority of seats in the Senate and House of Representatives belonged to the Democratic Party. He had to struggle to manage the situation with the two houses, which had a majority of opposing factions. Was the situation not quite thorny?</p>
<p>Removed from Office Due to Impeachment</p>
<p>The US President can be removed from office through "impeachment." "Impeachment" is a process initiated by members of the House of Representatives for accusations of treason, bribery, and other serious crimes. The Senate, according to the powers conferred by the Constitution, has the right to put the impeachment cases brought by the House of Representatives to a vote, but it must be agreed to by a two-thirds majority of all members for a disciplinary or removal case to be established. However, this impeachment procedure has only been used once in American history, in 1868, when Johnson was President. Johnson was removed from office midway due to impeachment by the Senate and House of Representatives. He did not commit crimes such as treason or bribery. The reason for his removal was that he dismissed the Secretary of War without the consent of the Senate.</p>
<p>Ten Secretaries: Seemingly Supporting Roles</p>
<p>One of the most important presidential powers is his veto power. He has the power to veto laws initiated by the US Congress, which means he can express disapproval, disagreement, and refuse to pass them into law. After the president's veto, the two houses must re-vote with a two-thirds majority for the law to be legally established. There are ten secretaries who help the president handle government affairs, and they are collectively appointed as his cabinet, acting like his supporting team. The names of the ten departments are: Department of State (roughly equivalent to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in other countries, but with much greater responsibilities and powers, hence the name "Department"; the head is called the Secretary of State, which is also included in the ten departments here), Department of the Treasury, Department of War, Department of Justice, Post Office Department, Department of the Navy, Department of the Interior, Department of Agriculture, Department of Commerce, and Department of Labor.</p>
<p>Annual Income of Three Thousand: Not as Good as a Merchant</p>
<p>The term of office is four years, and the salary is $75,000 per year. Several past presidents have been heavily indebted during their terms. Once, President Roosevelt's press secretary, Daniels, estimated the president's personal income and said: After paying all income taxes and all expenses in the White House, the president and his family can only receive $3,000 per year! Nevertheless, the position of President is still a high-ranking position that American politicians desperately strive for! The American President is not produced by direct election. The election method is as follows: Each state's Democratic and Republican parties (in fact, only these two major parties hold power in the United States. The presidents of all previous terms have been candidates from these two parties. Although other parties have emerged during and after the war, they have had little impact) have the same number of electors as the number of seats they hold in the Senate and House of Representatives. The electors of both parties must collectively nominate the party's presidential candidate. The candidate who receives the most votes is elected President. Under this system, if the opposing candidate wins the majority of votes in each state election, a candidate who receives the most votes in a direct election may be defeated by the opponent. This has a mathematical possibility.</p>
<p>Youthful Thirty-Five: Can Become President</p>
<p>In most countries, the president is selected from the Congress or Parliament. However, the American President is not produced in this way, so there is another dangerous possibility. That is, the elected president may not necessarily be someone with abundant political experience. Wilkie, who lost the presidential election in 1940, may be a clear example. Wilkie had never held public office before participating in the presidential election. To give another example, if a military person is elected president, then, apart from the experience gained in the military, there may not be much other significant experience? These are the criticisms of a French journalist. Candidates must be at least thirty-five years old to participate in the election, and they must also have been raised in the United States and resided in the United States for at least fourteen years. As mentioned above, before Roosevelt, American presidents could only serve a maximum of one consecutive term. Roosevelt not only served two terms, but from 1944, he simply served three consecutive terms, making a total of four terms as President. It can be said to be "unprecedented," and perhaps even "unsurpassed"!</p>
<p>Facing the World Alone</p>
<p>After President Roosevelt passed away in April 1945, Vice President Truman was the natural successor according to the American Constitution. There is a clause in the American Constitution that states: "In the event of the death or vacancy of the President, the Vice President shall succeed him. If the Vice President is also vacant, the cabinet secretaries, starting with the Secretary of State, shall succeed the Vice President." The main task of the Vice President is to serve as the President of the Senate. The Vice President's election campaign is usually held before the presidential election. At the same time, the Vice President is often elected for political reasons. If the Vice President succeeds as President, there is no Vice President's position in the country until the next presidential election. So, the current President Truman does not have a Vice President, isn't it like facing the complex and diverse world situation alone? (Youqin)</p>
<h3>Public Trial of the Traitor Lü Yiwen, Former Minister to Germany of the Puppet Manchukuo Government</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent Zhang Shengli from Kunming, Reported by Airmail on the 21st of This Month</p>
<p>Browsing through the confessions of traitors published in various newspapers recently, the traitor who claimed to be stateless is perhaps Lü Yiwen. Lü Yiwen once served as the Chief Secretary to the Prime Minister, Director of the Commerce Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the first Governor of Tonghua Province, and the first Minister to Germany under the "Kangde Emperor" of the puppet Manchukuo. Such a traitor with a not-so-small false title and a considerable demeanor was publicly tried in the prosperous and peaceful Kunming, which naturally aroused the attention of the general public.</p>
<p>Lecturing to the Judge: Expressing "Patriotic with a Curve"</p>
<p>At 2:00 PM on April 20, the front yard of the Yunnan Provincial High Court disappeared its usual state of neglect. Citizens jostled and crowded into the Criminal Court, scrambling to be the first. Latecomers climbed onto the window sills with justification, tearing up the window paper, all eager to catch a glimpse of the traitor's face. Lü Yiwen was wearing a gray tweed suit, gold-rimmed glasses, and German-style leather shoes. He had slightly graying hair with a layer of hair oil on it. When he was escorted to the court, the audience whispered, "Look at that Ren-Dan-style mustache, it's a symbol of a traitor!"</p>
<p>Judge Han Yunguo first questioned Lü Yiwen's place of origin. Lü Yiwen confessed, "I am from Jin County, Guandong, but I do not have Chinese nationality, because after the Sino-Japanese War, the Chinese in the Liaodong Peninsula lost their nationality." The judge then asked about each item in the indictment. Lü Yiwen immediately used skillful and sophistical techniques to explain his "patriotism," "love for the people," and "love for the family," and said, "Yiwen is not good at words and has a bad voice." Sometimes he used gestures to assist his tone, as if lecturing to the calm judge. In addition to expressing "Patriotic with a Curve," he also considered himself a "filial son."</p>
<p>Lü Yiwen Verbose and Evasive: Did Not Implement a Poisoning Policy</p>
<p>According to Lü Yiwen's confession: He was unemployed for two years before the September 18th Incident, and later served as a Japanese translator in the Northeast Aviation Headquarters. When the Northeast Army was transferred into the Guan Nei, his superiors did not allow him to enter, so he went to Dalian. Lü Yiwen pretended to be emotional and said, "At that time, the country was powerless, what could I do?" In March of the 21st year, Lü Yiwen became the Director of the Commerce Department of the puppet Manchukuo. His confession was: "That was a Director in name only, I didn't do anything, because there was no commercial relationship with the international community at all." He also admitted that during his tenure as Director, he did not sign any commercial treaties with Japan, nor did he help the Japanese plunder materials. When the audience heard this, they responded with cold laughter.</p>
<p>Judge Han asked, "Did you implement a poisoning policy in the puppet Manchukuo?" Lü Yiwen narrated: "No, no, I dare say no. The judge can imagine, in the nine counties of Tonghua Province, the people didn't even have enough to eat, how could they afford to smoke drugs? During my tenure as the Governor of Tonghua Province, the Governor-General of Korea ordered the purchase of land for immigration, and I opposed it to the death, causing dissatisfaction among the Japanese. As for conscripting young men, that was after Yiwen went to Germany. Yiwen said to the judge, please ask the judge to investigate in the Northeast, it is best to transfer this case to the Northeast Court for trial. If there are these things, Yiwen will commit suicide."</p>
<p>Shaking His Head and Waggling His Tail in Sophistry: Piling Up Beautiful Words</p>
<p>At this time, Lü Yiwen sophistically shook his head and wagged his tail, saying things like "relieving refugees, lending seeds," and "compassion for the world, saving the people from fire and water." A series of beautiful words made the audience feel jarring. But his "great achievements" were not limited to this. He said, "One million people in Jinzhou relied on him desperately fighting with the puppet Manchukuo to survive." At this point, he gave another example, further explaining: "The Northeast is like skin, Jinzhou is like hair. If Yiwen does not save the Northeast, where will the hair be attached?" "For example: The prostitutes in Jinzhou have never received a Japanese person." Finally, he ended the Northeast part of his confession with an expression of overwhelming emotion: "The war of resistance has now been won. After the invasion of the Russian and Japanese empires, Jinzhou has returned to the motherland, and Yiwen is willing to die!"</p>
<p>Met with Hitler: Afraid of Seeing Ambassador Chen Jie</p>
<p>In the 27th year, Germany recognized the puppet Manchukuo and exchanged envoys. Lü Yiwen then served as the Minister to Germany. According to his confession: He asked to resign because he didn't know German, but it was not approved, so he set off from Dalian on November 1 of that year. On the 21st of that month, he presented his credentials to the German government. He met with Hitler and also met with our country's Ambassador to Germany, Chen Jie, at a tea party, but he was too embarrassed to talk to Ambassador Chen. When the judge asked about the personnel organization and work of the embassy, Lü Yiwen said: There were only two Chinese staff members, and the rest were Japanese. The embassy's intelligence work was to collect European economic and news data, and did not collect military and political intelligence to supply to the puppet Manchukuo. He also said that all his actions were not free, "If I don't act like a scoundrel, they won't let me go?" He then confessed his capture experience, and finally said, "I feel honored to return to the motherland this time. Serving the puppet Manchukuo was due to a misunderstanding." (The simple trial and incessant sophistry continued until 3:40, when Judge Han announced the end of the special investigation court. When Lü Yiwen lowered his head and walked out of the courtroom, an old woman listening in the audience said, "Being a traitor is also a misunderstanding, really strange!")

<h3>The People's "Right to Health": An Item Urgently to Be Added to the Constitution</h3>
<p>— Liu Guansheng</p>
<p>In March of this year, the United Kingdom announced the National Health Service Act, under which all hospitals would be nationalized, and all citizens would receive free medical treatment. The purpose of this act is to show the nation's preparedness to fight disease and to uphold the people's "right to health." This is one of the most important social documents of our time. This act, together with the National Insurance Act and the Industrial Injuries Act, forms "the three pillars of the social security edifice that a new Britain is determined to build."</p>
<p>On April 8th of this year, the Chongqing Central Daily News also published the French New Declaration of Human Rights, which is the chapter on the rights of the people in the newly revised draft constitution of the Fourth Republic. Article 22 of that declaration states, "The nation guarantees that all citizens shall be able to benefit from national health and the protection of pregnant women, the development of sports, public health, and various measures derived from science." The preamble to the declaration also contains the sentence, "The French people declare that all human beings have sacred, inalienable rights that cannot be infringed upon by any law, and have decided to list these rights at the forefront of the constitution."</p>
<p>These two consecutive shocking reports, after being heard by us, the Chinese people who nominally rank among the five powers, truly leave us at a loss. Are we to be envious? Or ashamed? Are we to beg? Or to fight for it? Amidst this shock and joy, I would like to briefly express my views for the consideration of the wise and enlightened.</p>
<p>Listing the "right to health" as a fundamental right of the people, equally as important as the rights to body, residence, belief, speech, assembly, and association..., is a product of the progress of social thought in recent years, and also a new discovery of mankind regarding its own status. Because modern thought believes that people have the right to exist, and not only should they exist, but they must exist healthily and happily. If their health cannot be maintained and enhanced, the important meaning of their existence is lost. The first written method of acknowledging that people have the "right to rest" and guaranteeing its implementation by the government, with the establishment of various sanatoriums, medical centers, and other facilities, was stipulated in the Soviet Constitution (Articles 29 and 30 of the Soviet Constitution). This, along with the right to work and the right to education, is praised as a characteristic of the Soviet Constitution, and is also the origin of the "right to health."</p>
<p>Since the Second World War, people of foresight all over the world have further affirmed that "health is the greatest wealth in life" and "the health of the people is the most valuable resource of a country." Therefore, whether speaking from the perspective of the individual or the nation, the maintenance and enhancement of the people's "health" is undoubtedly an important matter, and it is a responsibility that the country cannot shirk. In other words, it is one of the most sacred rights of the people. Therefore, the Atlantic Charter put forward the Four Freedoms, one of which is "freedom from want." In 1943, former US Vice President Wallace, in his speech on the steps to postwar peace, said that "freedom from want" should be the essence of the new declaration of freedom. This freedom can be elaborated into seven items, the third of which is "freedom from unnecessary anxiety, disease, and hunger," which is the United States' first advocacy for "health."</p>
<p>In 1943, US President Roosevelt, in his message to Congress, proposed eight points to define the Second Bill of Rights of the People, the sixth of which was: "The right to obtain adequate medical care and enjoy health," and the seventh was: "The right to obtain adequate security from the fear of old age, illness, accident, and the economic difficulties of unemployment." The fifth point was: "The right of every family to a decent home"; the second point was: "The right to obtain sufficient food, clothing, and recreation." Matters related to clothing, food, housing, and medicine are all listed as rights of the people. Thus, both active and passive rights to health have been proposed.</p>
<p>The nine items of the new declaration of human rights stated in the 1943 general report of the US National Resources Planning Board include: "The fourth item is the right to obtain security, to be free from the terror of old age, hunger, dependency, illness, unemployment, and injury," and the third item is: "The right to obtain adequate clothing, food, living, and medicine."</p>
<p>The above items are all promises made by the US government regarding the rights of the people after the war while the war was still in progress, and also the confirmation by the United States of the "right to health."</p>
<p>As for the UK, before the end of the European war, the Beveridge Report was drafted in 1943, designing a comprehensive social security system. Beveridge said: "The purpose of Britain's war is to defeat dictatorship, and the purpose of its efforts for peace is to defeat the public enemies of the British people—want, disease, unemployment, ignorance, squalor... The solution to disease is public health and food policy..." The method of its implementation is that every person should enjoy the right to free medical treatment. After the end of the war, based on the Beveridge Plan, the formal "National Health Service Act" was formulated in March of this year, and from 1948, all citizens of the country will enjoy the right to free treatment.</p>
<p>Therefore, from the perspective of the major powers such as the UK, the US, France, and the Soviet Union, during several years of arduous warfare, the people have finally pursued a peaceful, happy, and reasonable society, and whether from the perspective of planning, implementation, theory, action, or written and unwritten laws and regulations, it is necessary to affirm the people's "right to health" and to maintain and promote the development of their health.</p>
<p>Our country has long borne the nickname "Sick Man of East Asia," and disease and weakness erode the majority of the people. We have a huge mortality rate of 30%, with more than six million unjustly dead each year. Various acute and chronic infectious diseases are prevalent year-round, parasitic and endemic diseases are widespread, and infant and maternal mortality is high. Environmental sanitation is poor, medical facilities are concentrated in cities, and most people cannot afford medical expenses. As a result, the vast agricultural population has never been exposed to medical care, especially modern scientific medical care, throughout their lives. Even in large cities such as Beiping and Nanjing, pre-war statistics showed that more than 40% of those who fell ill and died had never received any medical treatment (whether Chinese or Western medicine). The situation in other places can be imagined. The war was not a sacrifice in vain. The people of the UK, the US, France, and the Soviet Union are already building their ideal happy paradise and are planning and implementing their promises to ensure the enjoyment of the people's "right to health." Comparing the pre-war health facilities of the UK, the US, France, and the Soviet Union with our country, the difference is truly immeasurable, but as soon as the war stopped, they immediately and urgently tried their best to develop and plan for free and universal supply to all citizens. Shouldn't our people, growing up in such an environment, shout loudly and strive for the "right to health," one of the fundamental human rights?</p>
<p>The National Assembly will be held soon, and the constitution will be formulated soon. In this century of the people, it is of utmost importance to stipulate the "right to health" in the constitution and obtain the protection of the constitution. It not only conforms to the world trend, but also meets domestic needs, and has other constitutional precedents to follow, and is not a self-created thing. The people's eyes are the clearest, and the people's views on politics are the most realistic. The constitution is the people's own constitution. Now is the time to discuss the May 5th Draft Constitution. Rather than haggling over the issue of equal rights between the central and provincial governments, or the issue of checks and balances between the executive and legislative branches, it is better to discuss the important rights related to the people themselves, which will surely be gladly accepted by the masses. We are one of the five powers! We hope that the human rights enjoyed by the people of the other four powers, especially the "right to health," will also be enjoyed by the people of our Republic of China. The most important thing is to clearly list this right in the constitution. It is not included in the May 5th Draft Constitution. When the constitution is formally formulated and promulgated, it is hoped that a separate article on the "right to health" will be listed in the chapter on the rights of the people to meet the needs of the entire nation.

<h3>Beiping Education Bureau Director Ying Comes to Nanjing to Petition, Requesting Relief for a 100 Million Yuan Shortfall in Education Funds</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Nanjing Correspondent] Since the government announced the new standards for the treatment of public school teachers, the living allowance for Beiping City has also been set at 50,000 yuan, and the salary is calculated at 160 times the base salary. However, the current living allowance for primary and secondary school teachers in Beiping is only 20,000 yuan, and the salary base is only calculated at 70 times. Therefore, teachers throughout the city have gone on strike. Ying Qianli, the director of the city's education bureau, stated that the city's total expenditure is only 120 million yuan, and if expenses are issued according to the new standards, there will be a shortfall of approximately 100 million yuan, making it impossible to break this deadlock. He has come to Nanjing to petition and reported the financial plight of Beiping's education to the Ministry of Education on the 26th, requesting relief. It is also reported that the city used to rely on the national revenue from the Chongwenmen customs duties to provide funding. It is now planned to submit a request to the Executive Yuan based on the previous example, requesting the central government to allocate education funds to avoid "cooking without rice." (Yu)</p>

<h3>Large Numbers of Ministry of Education Staff Members Come to Nanjing One After Another</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent] Staff members from various departments of the Ministry of Education are coming to Nanjing one after another for the overall return to the capital.

As of the end of April, the Ministry of Education in Chongqing will no longer issue external documents. Any official documents received by various bureaus will be forwarded to Nanjing to be handled by the Ministry of Education. However, due to insufficient transport capacity, it will be difficult for the national middle schools and national colleges and universities above the junior college level in the rear to completely leave Chongqing for the time being. The Ministry of Education has specially retained commissioners in Chongqing to plan and assist the schools in carrying out the restoration work. (Yu)</p>

<h3>Hangzhou City Formulates a Plan to Eradicate Illiteracy in the City in Three Years, Focusing on Popularizing Literacy Education for 51,000 People This Year</h3>
<p>[Our Hangzhou Correspondent] The Hangzhou City Government believes that there are too many uneducated people in the city, which has a significant impact on the implementation of municipal administration and national construction. Therefore, it has formulated a plan to completely eradicate illiteracy in the urban area within three years. This year, it will first popularize literacy education for 51,000 people. In addition to the adult classes and women's classes, a total of more than 100 classes, that have already been opened by the municipal education authorities and have begun teaching, the city also sent letters to public, provincial, and private schools at all levels, as well as party, youth, military, and government agencies, groups, factories, and companies in the urban area, requesting them to jointly operate people's schools to achieve the goal of eliminating 51,000 illiterates this year. The methods are:</p>
<p>(1) Each primary and secondary school with more than four grades will run one level of people's school per year; Party, youth, military, and government agencies with 20 or more employees will run one level per year, and those with 50 or more employees will increase one level for every 50 employees; people's organizations with 50 or more members or employees will run one level per year; factories and companies with 100 or more employees will run one level per year. (2) Illiteracy within each unit must be eliminated first. (3) Private primary schools will be given subsidies. (Thin)</p>
<h3>Teacher Appreciation Football Exhibition Match: Old Boys Team Defeats Referees, East China vs. Westerners Mixed Team, Mayor Qian and Chairman Wu's Performance Remarkable, Ying Xingjiu Buys Charity Ball for 3 Million</h3>
<p>The Teacher Appreciation Movement football exhibition match was held at Yiyuan yesterday starting at 3:00 PM. In addition to the big match between East China and the Westerners mixed team, there was also an old boys' match and a physical education association versus referees association match. Therefore, although ticket prices were sold for 2,000 and 5,000, the audience still came enthusiastically and the atmosphere was enthusiastic, which was unprecedented. Mayor Qian, Chairman Wu, Director of Education Gu, General Li Chongshi, Director Yu, and others personally put on their uniforms and played, and their performances were brilliant. It was truly commendable. Halfway through the match, the match ball was auctioned off, and Mr. Ying Xingjiu of United Motors Co. bought it for 3 million yuan, which was admirable for his enthusiasm. The results of the two matches are as follows:</p>
<p>Old Boys Win</p>
<p>At 3:00 PM sharp, the old boys' match started first, with Dai Linjing as the referee and Li Yichen and Cai Shengmiao as the linesmen. All the old boys of the Physical Education Association took to the field and actually played very well. However, at first, they were not strong enough, so the referee took advantage of the situation and scored in the fourth minute, opening the scoring. Not long after, Jin Xibo's long shot broke the net again, and the referees scored two goals in a row. The Physical Education Association quickly brought in Zhou Jiaqi, Li Ning, Xu Wenkui, Qian Xucang, Zhou Jun, etc. Wang Weijun bravely took the lead and built the first merit for the association. In the 20th minute, A'kui shot a cold arrow from 30 yards away, and the ball bounced off the crossbar and went in, making it a tie of 2-2. However, before the end of the first half, Zhang Lemiao scored a goal, and the referees took the lead with a score of 3-2. In the second half, the Physical Education Association launched an all-out attack. In the fifth minute, they equalized again, making it 3-3. Soon after, A'kui headed the ball, and Wang Weijun rushed to it in time and pushed it into the net, and the Physical Education Association took the lead. In the tenth minute, Qu Xirong sent the ball to the center, and A'kui slammed it in, making it 5-3. After that, the referees tried their best to counterattack, but the Physical Education Association's central defender Wu Shaoshu and goalkeeper Zhou Jiaqi had a tight defense, making it difficult to succeed.

The current peak price (market) has reached 50,000 white yuan, and top white japonica and indica rice are selling for 41,200 yuan, which has a huge and significant impact. It is reported that 10 merchants are using the high price of rice and increased expenses as excuses to raise the prices of their goods, and if this continues, the future will be difficult to predict.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the prices of various grains rose sharply. The price of rice rose by another 3,000 yuan, the price of flour outside the market continued to rise, adding another 1,500 to 1,600 yuan, the oil market also soared by 5,000 to 7,800 yuan, soybeans skyrocketed by 1,230 yuan, peanuts followed by 2,300 yuan, bean cakes did not want to be left behind, rising by 800 to 900 yuan, bran also rose by 500 to 600 yuan, various grains came from behind, adding 3,4000 yuan, sesame rose by 2,300 yuan, and corn also rose by 2,000 yuan. There are few formal market prices.</p>
<p>According to rice market information: yesterday, a total of over 6,000 dan of 7 types of rice arrived in the city. The types and quantities of rice are as follows: white japonica 2,313 dan, thin rice 1,519 dan, early rice 1,212 dan, indica 282 dan, Du indica 676 dan, white yuan 306 dan, yin yuan 70 dan.</p>
<p>In other news: yesterday, the price of rice in Wuxi also reached a peak of 34,500 yuan. It is reported that the Food Administration is paying close attention to this. It is also reported that there are delays in the transportation and sales of merchants who purchase large quantities of grain, which is suspected of intentional hoarding. Once discovered, they will be severely punished. In addition, the Ministry of Food recently consulted with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to purchase rice and wheat from Siam, Burma, and other places in Hua for relief. Negotiations are still underway. Although no agreement has been reached, it is reported that the British side has expressed approval, but only the quantity is being discussed. According to the person in charge of the Ministry of Food in Shanghai, the procedures for purchasing grain will be completed in a short period of time, so overseas grain will soon arrive in the Shanghai market. It is reported that the second batch of grain purchase loans ordered by the Ministry of Food is set at 1.5 billion yuan, and the allocation of the loan purchasing area is very broad, with Shanghai accounting for only 300 million yuan.</p>
<h3>Gold Price Rises by 25,000</h3>
<p>Yesterday, raw gold turned from flat to firm. After securities firms profited, the remaining capital was slightly absorbed. Buying interest was slightly excited in the bland market. It opened flat in the morning, and activity began to be seen after 10 o'clock. Securities firms and Guangdong firms came to absorb slightly. At noon, it approached the 1.6 million mark again. In the afternoon, it once exceeded the 1.6 million mark and then slightly recovered. As a result, it rose by 25,000. Gold jewelry was listed up to 170,000 yuan. Silver was 1,600.

Although transactions were still conducted in secret, buyers were still excited. However, the bulls were mostly pulling up, and more miscellaneous buyers poured in, and the spread narrowed again. Unified C bonds opened in the morning and rose to 7,400 yuan. Halfway through, the high price of 7,600 yuan was seen, and then major players closed out one after another, once falling back to 6,800 yuan.

It opened flat in the morning. After opening, there was physical outflow, once falling to around 2,290 yuan, but soon it rebounded. In the morning, it hovered around 2,320 yuan. The market continued to rise slightly. As a result, it closed up 30 yuan compared to the previous close. Hong Kong bills were affected by the yarn traders' strong purchase of Hong Kong dollars, and operators in Hong Kong exchange rates covered their positions, which led to an increase of 28 yuan. Hong Kong electricity rose from 420 yuan to 440 yuan, and Robbie rose above 540 yuan.</p>
<h3>Ping Shui New Tea Opens; Sales Price Not Optimistic</h3>
<p>The "flag spear" produced in Shaoxing Ping Shui is not inferior in quality to Wenzhou goods, but production was delayed until yesterday. The tea market in the city is now in decline, so the opening price was not optimistic, at 200,000 yuan per dan. The buying interest in other grades of tea remains weak, while the suppliers are constantly agitated, and the market is generally in a downward process.</p>
<h3>Sugar Price Rises Endlessly</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market continued to rise sharply. The Association's medium-sized sand white once soared to 73,000 yuan in the morning, a rise of as much as 7,000 yuan, and then slightly declined, to 72,500 yuan to 71,000 yuan. In the afternoon, the Association's warehouse warrants were more popular, at 71,200 yuan, outside warehouse goods were 70,500 yuan, and customer goods were 70,000 yuan.

<h3>Market Filled with Rumors of Resumption; Chinese and Foreign Stocks Surge</h3>
<p>Large-scale inter-dealer transactions of Chinese stocks continue to be on hold. The report stated that Minister Yu said that the government would levy new taxes, and related to the issue of the resumption of the exchange. The general mentality believes that the exchange will soon resume operations. Although it is sensitive, it provides great encouragement to stock buyers. Each popular stock jumped a little in the morning. Buyers competed together. Trading was conducted in secret, and it was not easy to obtain an opponent. The market price was called higher and higher. Near noon, they all ended at new high prices. Due to the relationship of resumption, a general buying wave also rose in neglected stocks. Once a public market is established, the current distorted phenomenon will inevitably be thoroughly reformed, then the distance between popular and neglected stocks will be greatly narrowed. After the high noon closing, it recovered slightly. As a result, popular stocks each rose by about 15% compared to the previous close. Xinhuo, Zhongfa, Xinya underwear each rose by 20% to 35%, Zhongfang Dachanghua rose by only about 10%. Each veteran stock has not turned strong, only called stable.

Yisha jumped to 15,700 yuan in the morning, Yipi 3,500 yuan, British United 15,800 yuan, and buyers searched endlessly. At noon, they all ended at peak levels. As a result, compared to the previous close, Yisha rose by 2,000 yuan. British United's subsequent strength was insufficient and showed a slight decline, only rising by 1,000 yuan, Jardine Matheson rose by 2,500. In addition, each small stock also rose by about 10%.</p>

The spot supply is still not much. 16-count also rose by 12,000. 42-count Blue Phoenix is popular, with off-market transactions of 1.8 million.

<p>Except for summer goods such as Van Liding, Yu Yarn, Screw Four, Pali Si, Yarn Linen Tape, Yellow Green Twill, etc., there are few transactions recently. The market atmosphere at the Public Tea Association is dull. The standard market generally presents a stable but weak appearance. The sellers of general summer goods are unwilling to depreciate because of the lack of inventory and the remaining two months of actual sales. Buyers dislike that it has always been hovering at peaks and it is difficult for merchants to sell. Except for some inevitable advances, sales are far inferior to previous summer sales.</p>

<h3>US Senators Again Suggest Selling Silver</h3>

<h3>New Company Law; Limited Company Shareholders Still Have Ambiguities Awaiting Explanation</h3>
<p>Shen Jia Zhen, a company teacher in the city, and others, have doubts about Article 105 of Chapter 5 of the revised New Company Law of the National Government, and yesterday specially presented it to the Ministry of Economic Affairs for explanation. Briefly stated: "Checking Article 105 of Chapter 5 of the New Company Law, the Limited Company must have an organization of two or more shareholders and less than ten people, etc., I have doubts. It is suspected that the number of shareholders stipulated in this article, two or more and less than ten, should be the initial organization. However, the financial resources of each shareholder change over time, how can they remain unchanged? For example: a Limited Company, originally organized by ten shareholders, later one shareholder, due to financial difficulties, cannot maintain his original shares, so he transfers a part of the shares to others. If it is limited that non-original shareholders cannot accept, then it is feared that the original shareholders may not intend to accept, or collude with each other, so suppressing the shares seems inappropriate. If it is transferred to another person, then the number of shareholders in this company is more than ten people. According to the regulations in Article 105, it seems to be a violation; but according to Article 121, shareholders can transfer all or part of their shares to others, then there is no violation. I don’t know how to deal with it? In order to specifically ask Jun Department to give an explanation, so that we can follow!"</p>
<h3>Brazil Tung Oil Recently Increased Production Sharply</h3>
<p>[Reuters London, 27th] According to a recent report by the Carnegie Institute, Brazil has the potential to become a vegetable oil producing and marketing country. It is said that the tung oil production in São Paulo, Paraná, and Rio Grande do Sul is increasing sharply.

<h3>South African Gold Rumored to Increase in Price</h3>
<p>[Reuters Johannesburg, 27th] There is a rumor in the market that gold will increase in price soon. According to Reuters news, there may be some technical changes in gold trading, affecting the transaction of South African gold sold to London, but the world gold price will remain unchanged.</p>
<h3>Dried Longan Continues to Rise</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the price of large dried longan rose again in the market, rising by another 3,000 yuan, opening to 63,000 yuan. Lanzhuzhi spot transactions are 135,000 yuan, and the market situation is firm.</p>
<h3>Economic Briefs</h3>
<p>It is reported that the number of overdue counterfeit banknotes that have not been exchanged is still 12 billion, and the face value is below 200 yuan. The Ministry of Finance once ordered the Central Bank in various places to complete the registration, but according to the person in charge of the issuance bureau of the Shanghai branch, very few people have applied.</p>
<p>The Shanghai branch of the China Farmers Bank recently held four types of emergency agricultural loans, silkworm seed farm loans, silkworm breeding loans, and small-scale water conservancy loans. It is reported that many nearby counties have recently applied to the bank for loans. As of recently, the bank has released 20,325,000 yuan in emergency agricultural loans, 177,200,000 yuan in silkworm seed farm loans, 135,390,000 yuan in silkworm breeding loans, and 2,000,000 yuan in small-scale water conservancy loans. It is still continuing to release loans. Since the Liangzhe Salt Administration continued to register newly established small salt merchants, more than 500 businesses in the city have been approved to operate. All salt dealers will implement universal distribution. In recent days, applications for supplementary registration have been very enthusiastic, and the bureau will not restrict them.</p>
<p>The government has formulated a plan for disaster relief in Hunan: (1) Allocate 500 million yuan from the Four Joint Banks as a grain purchase fund, (2) Transport 4 million shi of surplus grain from Sichuan Province to Hunan as soon as possible, (3) Reduce the amount of military grain purchased in Hunan Province, and (4) Transport grain stored in Nanjing to Hunan Province.</p>
<p>Due to drastic fluctuations in prices in Hankou, the amount of funds needed has increased, resulting in high interest rates. The black market interest rate is particularly alarming. Currently, the market is 4 yuan per day, the term interest is 7 yuan, and the monthly interest is 3%. There is also the so-called "Kua Zi Qian", which is a principal of 7,000 yuan, with a total monthly repayment of 10,000 yuan, and the "Bian Zi Qian" which is a principal of 10,000 yuan, with a monthly interest of 300 yuan.</p>
<p>Qingdao Baolong Foreign Company has begun to receive orders. Caustic soda is currently priced at US$35 per barrel, but the shipping schedule cannot be determined, and there are not many transactions at present.</p>

<h3>Regarding Film People Who Collaborated with the Enemy</h3>
<p>— Xu Suling</p>
<p>During the Anti-Japanese War, Shanghai's Changying business was controlled by the enemy and puppets. Some film merchants and film practitioners, especially after the outbreak of the Pacific War, due to pessimistic understanding and excessive selfish concepts, willingly served the enemy and cooperated with the enemy and puppets, turning the entire Shanghai film industry into an institution under the control of the enemy and puppets. In this middle, most of the employees were indeed forced to participate in the film business institutions of the enemy and puppets due to the pressure of life during this period. Now that the enemy has surrendered for eight months, the Shanghai enemy and puppet film business institutions, except for those that originally cooperated with the enemy and puppets and sold to the enemy and puppets, some parts were originally occupied or leased from the people, and after being taken over, some have been cleared and returned, and some are being investigated and returned. As for a group of film people who collaborated with the enemy, except for twenty-one who have been arrested, whether the majority of others need to be punished or identified, although there have been several symposiums and what meeting mentioned it, there has been no decision so far.</p>
<p>China's film industry was originally very backward, and there was a great lack of talent. As far as I know, most of the employees who participated in the pseudo-film institutions were indeed living in poverty, and the content of the films they produced (I have read all the film scripts produced by "Huaying") except for a very small number with problems, most of them did not oppose the government's anti-war policy. There were even works of educational significance. Of course, there are a small number of "Huaying" senior personnel, especially those who cooperated with the enemy and puppets at the upper level, regardless of whether they withdrew from "Huaying" midway, but they lived comfortably, which shows that they used the power of the enemy and puppets at that time to accumulate wealth and exploit the poor employees. After victory, they still live comfortably and cleverly cover up their crimes. However, because this group of people is not purely employees, their names are not necessarily on the credits of the films. Therefore, they are not noticed by people. In addition, they have money and can move around in all directions. However, most employees, they have had more than 20 years of experience in film art and technology, and at least six or seven years of history. They are now waiting for legal punishment, or to be freed. Although their bodies are very free, they need to live and need to work. Before the identity of the film people who collaborated with the enemy is determined, they cannot get work. In particular, for some directors, it is so difficult to train a film director in China.</p>
<p>I have been back to Shanghai for seven or eight months. Because of my job, I haven't said anything. But I saw that those who should be restrained have ways to deal with it, while those who are usually very poor can't move at all and can't live. I can't help but put forward a few suggestions to the Fu Bureau and people who care about the film industry:</p>
<p>1. Please ask the competent authorities and judicial organs to promptly investigate and report the film people who collaborated with the enemy, and punish them (although I know that the relevant institutions have submitted a list of reports, but no news has been seen so far). At the same time, issue measures for punishing personnel who participated in pseudo-film institutions, so that a small number of people who willingly serve the enemy can receive their due punishment, and the majority of employees can also restore their work under certain measures.</p>
<p>2. Please ask people who care about the film industry and film practitioners themselves to collect evidence of the crimes of film people who collaborated with the enemy, and report them to the government's competent authorities, or directly report them to the court.</p>
<p>3. Please ask the government's competent authorities to send personnel to jointly review all the products of the so-called pseudo "Huaying" with prestigious scholars, so as to judge the crimes of film practitioners from their works.</p>
<h3>Record of the Two Main Actors in "The Bells of St. Mary's"</h3>
<p>— Xin Ming</p>
<p>The highest-grossing and considered best film in the United States for 1945 was "The Bells of St. Mary's." Its popularity was due to the exquisite performances of its stars, Bing Crosby and Ingrid Bergman, and the novel and skillful direction of Leo McCarey.</p>
<p>This film was released before Christmas last year as a precious gift to welcome the first major festival after the peace. When it was screened in New York, Americans went somewhat crazy for it. Every day, the theater entrances were crowded, with people scrambling to get in, far surpassing the sold-out success of films in Shanghai, demonstrating the astonishing American passion for movies and the incredible nature of this film. The film was produced by Rainbow Company, owned by Bing Crosby, and distributed by RKO Pictures.</p>
<p>Now, let's talk about the two main actors. Male lead Bing Crosby has been in the film industry for eighteen years. In recent years, he has become very popular in Hollywood, twice earning the top spot among the top ten highest-grossing stars in 1944 and 1945. He has co-starred with Dorothy Lamour in many films, such as "Road to Singapore" and "Road to Zanzibar," which have been screened in Shanghai. After watching his films, I don't think anyone could resist his baritone voice! He not only became famous on the screen but also dedicated himself to broadcasting. In "The Bells of St. Mary's," he plays a priest with a strong desire for education, founding a school filled with his care, compassion, and warmth.</p>
<p>As for the female lead, Ingrid Bergman, she is a Swede. Her role in "Intermezzo" with Leslie Howard was the first film to make her famous. She later starred in "Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde," "Casablanca," "For Whom the Bell Tolls," and others, all of which received critical acclaim. Last year, she starred in three major films: "Spellbound," "Saratoga Trunk" (with Gary Cooper), and "The Bells of St. Mary's." The famous American magazine "Life" even said that 1945 was "Bergman's Year." In "The Bells of St. Mary's," she plays a nun in a Catholic church, with acting skills that are perfect and sublime, reaching the pinnacle. Henry Travers also delivers an excellent performance, playing a landlord who is prone to bizarre ideas and complaints. Do you remember him? He is also the stationmaster in "Mrs. Miniver," Walter Pidgeon! This supporting role adds much color to every film.</p>
<h3>Hollywood News</h3>
<p>Two atomic bombs ended World War II, and Hollywood producers are very aware of the excitement surrounding this name. They are all trying to acquire screenplays that use the deployment of the atomic bomb as a plot element. Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer has adopted a script by Bob Considine. According to Sam Marx, the film describes the story of the atomic bomb's creators sacrificing themselves and working hard to research until its completion. Although it is not a documentary, it is based on facts. During filming, the American Association of Scientists sent experts to serve as consultants and liaised with the Atomic Energy Commission.</p>
<p>Ronald Colman's status in the film industry is comparable to that of John Barrymore and Douglas Fairbanks. Now, only Colman remains in the film industry, spanning two eras, from silent films to sound films to color films, a truly difficult and honorable achievement. This June, his contract with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer will expire, and Colman intends to retire.</p>

<p>Mr. Wu Xiwei asks: (1) The rental contract was originally indefinite, but the lessee voluntarily established a fixed term of five years, filled it out himself, and both parties sealed it. The fixed term is about to expire soon. What procedures should be followed to recover the house? (2) I only have one storefront property, which was rented out in the 26th year of the Republic of China. Now I want to open my own store for self-use, so the contract was not renewed. Fortunately, the War of Resistance was won, and the property rights are protected again. Please advise on how to recover the house?</p>
<p>[Reply from Lawyer Fu Kuanglin] (1) According to the law, the lease can indeed be recovered upon the expiration of the fixed-term lease. However, it is still necessary to see if there is a provision in the lease agreement that allows for renewal. (2) If only the guarantor has moved elsewhere, it cannot be immediately assumed that the entire contract is invalid. If the lessor must recover the property for self-use, there must be solid evidence to support the claim.</p>
<p>Mr. Huang Huayi asks: According to the provisions of Article 1 of the Lawyer Law, as amended and promulgated on April 5, 1945 of the Republic of China, it does not seem that "graduation from the law department of a university or independent college or studying law for more than three years and obtaining a diploma" is a requirement for obtaining lawyer qualifications. Is this really the case according to the law? A friend of mine graduated from a general high school course and has worked in a law firm for fifteen years. If he does not pursue higher education, but intends to obtain lawyer qualifications through higher examinations or other examinations, is this possible? Please provide guidance.</p>
<p>[Reply from Lawyer Fu Kuanglin] According to the provisions of the Lawyer Law, in addition to those who have passed the lawyer examination and are qualified as lawyers, those who have one of the qualifications listed in Article 1, Paragraph 2 of the law may be subject to strict inspection. However, our country has not yet held a lawyer examination.</p>
<p>Mr. Wang Dao asks: I am from Dongtai, Subei. I run a business and have earned some surplus. After the surrender of the enemy last year, I was deeply afraid of attacks by the Communist army, which would inevitably lead to losses. At that time, I sold my goods and purchased more than one hundred acres of farmland to avoid losses. I would like to ask: (1) Does the above-mentioned sale of property rights have legal effect? (2) The seller is a widow, with no children, only two daughters. Although there is a nephew, the nephew is not named on the contract, but is named with her two daughters. Their families have been living separately for more than ten years, and there is no entanglement in the family. However, the nephew is not used, but is named with the two daughters. Does this contract have legal effect? (3) At that time, the land price was calculated in counterfeit currency, but later, when the Communist army captured it, a small amount of the final price was not settled. In the future, when settling the account, it should be converted into legal currency according to the number. This is a special situation. If the other party has different words, is it valid? (4) Are wartime real estate transactions legally valid?</p>
<p>[Reply from Lawyer Fu Kuanglin] (1) If the procedures are complete, it can naturally take effect according to the law. (2) If the nephew is not the widow's adopted son, there is no need to name him, and it can take effect. (3) When paying the final price in the future, counterfeit currency can no longer be used, and it should of course be converted into legal currency at the rate, which does not affect the validity of the transaction. (4) Legal transactions between private individuals during wartime are valid.</p>
