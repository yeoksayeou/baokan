<h3>東北問題尚未獲協議　日內在京繼續會商　馬歇爾昨再謁蔣主席</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿九日電〕外訊：馬歇爾對東北問題談判，須先在重慶成立一祥和草案，又期雙方至京轉換環境後，談判能在和諧穩定之氣氛中順利完成，故又展緩行期，昨今沿江氣候均不佳，如卅日放晴，馬使有立刻來京可能，否則將延至下月二日前到達。京中立人士咸望蘇北共軍勿再以火藥及血腥氣味迎接此和平使者。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿九日電〕重慶訊：共軍在蘇北之新行動傳至重慶後，曾使正在順流而下之東北談判起一廻波，但因政府態度極爲鎮定，旋告平靜。今東北談判仍在討價還價中，聞馬歇爾所提之停戰新方案連備忘錄，計有十點，包括（一）東北全面停戰，（二）共軍不得佔領哈爾濱，國軍暫緩向長春前進，（三）對地方政權，雙方暫取保留態度，由協商解決，（四）美艦運送國軍，其任務又接收主權爲原則，（五）共軍不得妨礙政府遣俘送僑之任何行動，（六）從速恢復交通，任何一方對東北交通不得加又割裂，（七）停戰令頒發後，雙方立刻停戰，心便軍事調處工作之展開，（八）凡進入東北之雙方軍隊，均須以整軍方案爲編整原則，（九）美軍由華北撤退後，由國軍接防。（十）雙方須以誠意停止宣傳戰。</p>
<p>〔聯合社南京廿九日電〕今日新民報重慶電稱，馬歇爾特使爲解決東北嚴重慶局勢，已向蔣主　及中共代表提出四點：（一）產即無條件停戰，（二）於總選學前，保持東北政權現狀，（三）依照整軍計劃，改編東九省軍隊，（四）除接收領土外，停止用美國船隻運輸中央軍至東北。關於東北各軍駐防區或，將由三人小組決定，馬帥並附有節略，規定華北美軍撤退後，由中央軍兩師接防。聞政府已允遵守第二點，惟堅持在停止衝突令發出以前，須先接收長春。</p>
<p>〔中央社重慶廿九日電〕據美新聞處訊，馬歇爾今晨十時三十分起與中共代表周恩來晤談，至十二時許會議尙在進行中，馬帥預定今日下午再往山洞謁蔣主席會談。</p>
<p>〔聯合社重慶廿九日電〕馬歇爾特使猶未能融和政府與中共雙方意見，致東北戰事一時尙不獲解決。華方消息靈通人士稱：民主同盟所提停戰方案，主張由共軍佔據東北大部份，蔣主席已予拒絕，寗可於國軍收復長春後，再行停戰，馬氏現令其總部明日遷京。中共發言人說實在渝談判已吿停止，中共代表將於數日內赴京，繼續磋商。蔣主席可望於五月三日前往首都，蔣主席與周馬週來曾商討各種停戰辦法，最近之停戰方案，係民主主同盟草擬，得周馬兩人同意，昨夜提交蔣主席，今談判中止，足見方案已遭拒絕。消息靈通人士稱：中共匝月前曾願放棄長春哈爾賓及鐵長鐵路，以求停戰，然目前要求更高之和平代價，堅主東北大局須照現狀謀取解決，果爾，中共所佔地區，幾達東北九分之八，各方咸知馬氏已竭其全力，擬在長春爭奪戰再度爆發前，使戰事終止</p>
<h3>杜聿明出發視察　四平街外圍正展開激戰</h3>
<p>〔本報北平廿九日電〕瀋陽電，杜聿明已由瀋出發，視察國軍接收情形，何日返潘，尙未確定，鄭洞國則早在前方，梁華盛現在開原。有謂遼河方面將有激戰</p>
<p>〔本報北平廿九日電〕綜合政府中共兩方消息，新四平街現仍在共軍手中，廿日晚國軍一部確曾進入新四平街，但以守軍火力猛烈，旋即退出，現戰事仍在四平街外圍進行，兩方實力相若，戰事殆已成膠着狀態。四平街之攻守戰，自四月四日國軍進駐昌圖後，即已開始，十八日後戰事更趨激烈，新一軍所屬十二軍一部，沿長鐵自南面及東南面前進，新一軍另一部配合三十一軍，沿四洮路自西與西南方前進，迂迴至四平街西北，但共軍實力强勁，頗出國國軍意外，故此包圍圈未能逐漸縮小，兩軍仍慘烈戰門中。</p>
<p>〔本報北平廿九日電〕記者今晤某來自東北之非官方人，彼三日前曾親至新四平街附近一探戰况眞象，據稱：東北國軍因共軍利用所有可能利用條件，以作阻止，故接收進展甚緩，國軍確曾有二排人進入新四平街，但已與四平街外之國軍失去聯絡，迄其離開四平之時爲止，彼不敢斷定四平尙有戰事。他方國軍先頭部隊一部，亦曾繞過四平街，北進十公里左右，但的二團以上部隊亦與四平街之國軍失去聯絡。該氏表示，四平街有相當數目之外人，以巨砲協助共軍作戰，此等握有武器外人，有曾作蘇軍俘虜之日軍。</p>
<p>〔合衆社北平廿九日電〕據此間華人方面消息稱：在過去七十二小時中，四平街前綫大雨滂沱，致使國軍前進益感困難。據稱：該處道路因融雪關係，已泥濘不堪，今復連日大雨，幾使遣送援軍及軍需品不能通過，曾在緬甸率領新一軍及新六軍之鄭洞國將軍，刻在四平街指揮軍事。據華人方面消息，共產軍不特在四平街及公王嶺斷絕交通，並在遼河北岸建築强大之防綫。</p>
<p>〔又電〕今日據潘陽最後軍息：新一軍前鋒，刻正以「扇形」戰術，沿瀋長鐵路向北猛攻，四平街區前綫，已迅速促展至六十哩。</p>
<h3>東北接收要員　已抵海參崴</h3>
<p>張作相等由錦到瀋</p>
<p>〔本報北平廿九日電〕軍調部政府副參謀長鈕先銘赴瀋，準備交涉留陷長春政府接收人員安全事。</p>
<p>〔路透社南京廿九日電〕此間獲悉：中國政府派往東北接收之人員，的有高級要員七十人已抵達海參崴。</p>
<p>〔中央社潘陽廿九日電〕東北行營政委會委員張作相·王樹翰等四十餘人，今由錦抵瀋。</p>
<p>〔中央社北平廿九日電〕東北行營秘書廳長許鵬飛在平公畢，今晨飛潘，長鐵副理事長王徵同行。</p>
<h3>冀南永年城解圍有望　已商定兩項辦法　組運糧會并撤換指揮官</h3>
<p>〔本報北平廿九日電〕爲謀永年解圍軍調部曾協議三項，其中之一爲調換雙方部隊首領，政府方面新人選已於昨日前往，共方尙在銓衡中。</p>
<p>〔本報北平廿九日電〕軍調部共方參謀長羅瑞鄕，前爲向周恩來報吿軍事三人小組代表赴東北調査經過赴渝，昨已飛返張家口，明日返平。</p>
<p>〔中央社北平廿九日電〕冀南永年被圍已久，經軍調部多日努力，今始商定兩項解圍辦法；（一）組織運糧機構，救濟災民，（二）撤換永年城內外雙方軍隊指揮官，現已由三方會同當地民衆，組成食糧委會，負責運糧，救濟居民。撤換指揮官一事，十一戰區業於昨日遣高級參謀一人，前往永年接替，中共方面新指揮官人選，正由劉伯誠請示中。</p>
<h3>共軍在隴海津浦兩綫　　集中兵力六十團　襲南通共軍已不支後退</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿九日急電〕軍息，共軍在蘇北海安如阜，及南通海門附近，泰縣之姜堰，隴海東路自白塔舖迄大許家之綫，距離六合的九十華里之安徽來安縣境，津浦綫之臨城，已集中六十團以上兵力，開始廣泛攻勢，揚言「解放」五洲（揚州·泰州·通州·徐州·鄭州），並將重襲賈汪煤鑛，官方對局勢之嚴重，雖不否認，但對勘亂應變之把握，確具信心。日前來京主訓之將領，頃均已返防，聞白副總長業至鄭州，定月初返京。</p>
<p>〔本報鎭江廿九日電〕自共軍攻佔南通以東之觀音山·興仁·小海三鎮後，國軍即積極增強實力，並於廿八日下午二時得空軍之協助，開始反攻，迄今日午後，先頭部隊距小海鎭僅四里之遙。</p>
<p>〔中央社南京廿九日電〕軍息，共軍於廿七日晚及廿八日拂曉，分三路進攻南通縣區，經國軍反擊，共軍不支後退，截至廿九日上午，國軍已將小海鎭，觀音山鎭，先後收復。但共軍此次達反停戰命令之行動，似企圖於國民大會行將開會之際，授亂京滬治安，軍事當局，正密切注視其發展。</p>
<h3>長春激戰記</h3>
<p>〔合衆社長春十九日電〕（遲到）在蘇軍撤退之後，衣衫襤褸的共產軍三萬人，今天已經完全佔領東北的首邑長卷。他們的配備大部份是日本步槍和美國舊式的溫吉斯德式槍，事前曾和政府軍九千人發生血戰，每一條街，每一座房屋，都經過激烈的爭奪。戰事前後達六日之久。</p>
<p>參加這一次戰役的共產軍，大部份是第八路軍部隊，由總司令林彪指揮。這一仗，在戰略和政略上講，都極其重要，因爲共產軍的佔領長春，已經把政府軍和北滿的關係切斷，包括蘇軍預定於四月二十五日撤離的哈爾濱在內。</p>
<p>共產軍由四方面湧入長春，大砲作掩護，其數量之多，在東北方面尙屬僅見，他們在突鈹長春的內部防線之後，迫使國軍退向大同廣塲，國軍在道個廣塲中，擠得彷彿像沙田魚一般，他們把六座公共建築物變成了防守的堡壘，把舊書，市府檔案和家具以及沙袋等等塞在窗口，希望奮力據守，直等新一軍可能從四平街開到。但是共產軍從附近屋頂所發出的槍火，迫使國軍退到直徑五分之一里的大同廣塲中，結果或遭槍彈掃射，或被俘虜。</p>
<p>據可靠消息，國軍一千五百人中·有三百人曾在中央銀行作最後掙扎，昨天在最後一次衝鋒中，榮已陣亡，長春國軍司令陳家珍少將曾手執手槍，親自率領部下，陳將軍腿上中彈倒地，被共產軍俘獲。</p>
<p>大同廣塲作爲堡壘的六座建築，已經在星期四下午和晚上，先後被共產軍佔領，陳家珍將軍的司令部所在地中央銀行最後失守，時間在晚上九時。</p>
<p>國際電訊社的特派員埃培納和記者本人（合衆社特派員柏卡特），在星期四下午曾往訪市長趙君邁，幾乎被圍在中央銀行大厦之內。當我們還在那裏的時候，中國飛行員駕駛的美國租借飛機飛臨上空，用降落傘投下軍火，我就跑到屋頂上去，看見大部份的降落傘落在共產軍的地區之內，但是到了下一天的早晨，全部降落傘都落在國軍防錢之內了。就在那時候，我突然發覺共產黨從四方面向前推進，離開大同廣塲已經不到一千碼光景，槍彈在屋頂上飛過，嘶嘶作響，並且愈來愈多了，在沙袋上據守的兵士，逐漸有人受傷了。我尋到了埃培納和趙市長，就急急忙忙地跑下樓梯，想回到市長的家裏去，我們跳進一輛汽車，當時有一排槍彈掃射到藏有大量軍火的塲地上來，其中有一個子彈打中了我們的車子，受傷的人用麻布担架搬走，而向後退下來的國軍，則擁到中央銀行大厦來預備作最後的據守。</p>
<p>我們進了汽車，向市長的家急駛而去，大的在離目的地半里的地方，有三顆子彈射中我們的汽車，但是並沒有人受傷。半小時之後，我們從窗口望出去，看見幾千個共產黨帶着步槍和機槍，蛇行匐伏地向大同廣塲進迫，爭奪大同廣塲的戰鬥已經開始，我們的房屋已經變成了前綫的一個據點，國軍的子彈正向這邊飛過來。有幾個共產軍看到了我們屋頂上的美國旗，對我們微笑，在隔壁的一個塲地上，他們已經開始在掘壕溝和機槍巢了。繼而共產黨就跑到我們的房子裏來，在二個窗口架了砲，選擇了目標射撃。</p>
<p>他們看我們彷彿看動物院中的奇禽怪獸一樣，他們中間看見過美國人的極少，大多數人以爲我們是俄羅斯人，曾想用幾句俄國話來和我們搭訕。我們靠了譯員的帮助，才知道他們大部份是從山東來的第八路軍，還有相當數量的新四軍部隊。他們的服裝　褸不堪，鞋子尤其不像樣，但是他們武器雖雜，却可以作戰。國軍缺乏重武器的原因之一，就是長春的四千國軍係用飛機從北平空運來的。</p>
<p>共產軍爭奪長春的戰事，共分五個階段進行：（一）奪取三處飛機塲，在空中切斷國軍的連絡，（二）佔領該城唯一的火車站，因此共產軍可以從北方靠鐵路線獲得增援，（三）將少量的國軍擠到大同廣塲去，（四）再向大同廣塲攻擊他們，（五）在下一天掃蕩全城。</p>
<p>〔合衆社北平廿九日電〕共黨負責方面人士今日稱：一共黨與美國代表所組成之聯合調査團團透露謂：共黨所稱美機襲擊四平街區聯合民主軍一節，係屬不確。査共黨所指者，原係美機，但旋即根據戰後之協定，移交與中國空軍，此項移交情事，曾於若干時前公布者。</p>
<h3>共軍破壞北寗鐵路　平瀋車又告不通　軍調部美代表被共軍開槍射傷</h3>
<p>〔本報北平廿九日電〕東北戰事激烈聲中，共軍復展開其對國軍軍運破壞運動，破壞北寗路，昨晚十一時，共軍突襲北寗路關外段之江家信號傷（在綏中以南），截至今晨，猶在與守軍激戰中，同時萬家屯與前所問之三四九號橋，亦被破壞的廿米，故平潘軍復告不通，今預定由秦皇島開潘之新一軍軍車，臨時中止開出。</p>
<p>〔中央社瀋陽廿九日電〕軍息：駐朝陽之軍調部廿六小組美代表葛瑞夫中校，乘吉普車前往北票西四十五華里東官營子附近視察，於通過東官營子進至小八溝以北的半里處，經國軍多方聯絡，共軍不予置信，竟開槍射擊，帶路鄕人一名被擊斃，葛瑞夫中校亦負傷。</p>
<h3>顧大使昨訪宋院長　商談當前外交問題　回嘉定掃墓後即飛英返任</h3>
<p>〔中央社本市訊〕我國駐英大使顧維鈞博士，廿七日偕秘書劉選萃由渝飛京，當晚即乘夜快車，於廿八日晨抵滬，昨日下午顧氏曾訪宋院長，對當前外交問題有所商談，一一時在庽接見記者，雖連日旅途勞頓，精神仍極健旺。聞顧氏日內赴嘉定掃墓，稍作勾留，即由滬飛英返任，茲將顧氏談話內容擇載如次：</p>
<p>和會召開爲期不遠</p>
<p>最近在巴黎舉行之四國外長會議，爲世界和會之前奏，全世界人士備極注目，記者請訽顧大使作何觀察，顧氏稱四國外長會議主要課題，爲商討和的基本原則，幷解決歐洲軸心附庸國若干實際問題。自倫敦五國外長莫斯科三國外長會議，及五國外長代表會議迄今，此類問題，尙未獲致具體解決途徑。相信此次會議諸國必能本互讓互諒之精神，取得圓滿協議，而安定歐洲國際局勢，進一步安定世界局勢。戰後國際間除英暹和的外，尙未訂立其他和的，現距離軸心瓦解瞬近一年，聯合國聰明睿智之士，均希望世界和的早日產生，吾人自亦同樣寄以熱烈之期望。巴黎和會之召開，爲期當不在遠。</p>
<p>其次談及新國聯及國際代管制度問題，顧氏稱二聯合國機構歷次會議，對國際代管制度，均有詳密之商討，關於代管原則及宗旨，已在聯合國靈章中，有所規定，惟執行機構迄未確定，本年九月間，聯合國召開大會或可成立一代管委員會，負責主持。記者詢及蒙特委條約，在目前是否適用，顧氏說明該條約，已訂立十年，爲維持國際永久和平，將來或需修正　變更。</p>
<p>原子能應合理運用</p>
<p>記者又請詢顧大使，全世界人士對原子能應用間題，主張秘密及公開者，互有所見，究宜作何看法，大使說明，解決原子能一般問題，國際間已有原子能管制委員會之組織，由國聯理事國十一國及加拿大等十二國家組織，該委員會主要任務有四：（一）交換科學知識，（二）應用原子能從本和平生產，（三）限制各國使用原子能之武器，（四）取締並懲罰違反原子能管制原則之一切行爲，惟其體應用原子能方案，尙未確立，將來原子能之供應科學生產，自無疑議，但尙需相當時間。</p>
<p>關於促進中英貿易方面，顧氏稱：中英兩國貿易，在歷史上發生最早，迄今從未中斷。此次戰後，英國正竭力恢復生產，希望增進對外貿易，我國對友邦貿易合作，早有提倡，將來兩國貿易前途之發展，自可預料，惟有若干具體問題，尙需兩國當局相互諒解，共同解決。顯氏並曾述及香港問題，認爲係一政治性之問題，經過相當時日，必可得到具體解決。</p>

<p>再次談及世界糧食分配問題，顧氏稱：糧荒已爲普遍現象，今年印度，澳大利，南非諸國，均閑旱災，收成不足，輸出减少，英美加世界糧食管理委員會成立後，更以爲我國係農業國家，故未能充足分配，實際我國在戰前每年即有大批食糧進口，以濟飢荒，自經此次戰爭，糧食之缺乏，當更較歐洲國家情形爲重。個人爲購買糧食事，曾於二中全會開會期間，遲歸一星期，與英當局詳作磋商，預料秋收以後，我國食糧當能獲得較多供應，最近糧食部通電全國，實行節約糧食運動，個人極表贊同，現英美諸國亦正限制釀酒，實施糧食節約。記者最後詢及東北問題，顧氏稱：我國局處列强之問，解決東北間題，實不僅限於外交途徑，目前政府正盡最大努力，本一定方針，在中蘇友好條約範圍內，謀取合理解決方式，個人深信，在最短期間內，可以得一具體解決。談至此，記者即興辭而出。</p>

<p>社論</p>
<h3>迎胡佛專使蒞華</h3>
<p>美國前總統胡佛氏，爲考察世界糧荒，今日將由菲律濱飛來中國，可望於下午行抵上海。胡佛氏此次東來，係以美國急賑委員會主席及杜魯門總統糧食專使之資格，研究全世界糧食情况。這一任務，胡佛氏是特別能勝任愉快的。在第一次世界大戰後，胡佛氏曾爲解救歐洲的糧荒，立下了不可磨滅的功跡。事隔二十年，人類又經過另一次大戰，胡佛氏以高齡而不辭勞瘁，週歷全球，硏究解救糧荒對策，他的悲天憫人的心腸，實令人表示無限的崇敬。特別是中國，中國人民對於這位卓越的領袖，這位領袖對於中國人民允有一種彼此深切了解的情誼。胡佛氏過去在中國曾居留過一個時期，此番舊地重來，遠東面目自已非復當年，中國正從八年的長期戰爭苦難中獲得了勝利。創巨痛深，瘡痍未復，一切善後救濟和復員努力，猶待積極展開。胡佛氏適於此際來華，我們謹向這位卓越的政治家表示我們由衷的歡迎！</p>
<p>講到糧荒，中國經長期的戰爭，壯丁減少，田園荒蕪，交通殘破，農產低落，以致感到嚴重的糧荒，此原爲戰爭所不可避免的結果。「大兵之後，必有凶年」，這是一般人的常識。即在平時，中國縱有農業國家之號，也仍須倚持國外農產的輸入。只要一査海關册上米麥的進口數額，即可知其眞相。何况經八年血戰，中國產糧區域，除四川一省外，餘均曾爲戰塲，中國目前的糧荒，到了如何嚴重的階段，不言而喩。糧食部徐部長雖尙宣稱糧食無處不給，藉以安慰老百姓，但行政院善後救濟總署署長蔣廷　出席聯合國善後救濟總署會議時懇切的呼籲，究竟代表着事實。可是蔣署長的呼籲雖贏得各方面的同情，而實際結果却未能滿足中國的迫切要求。今番胡佛氏以糧食專使資格來華，深信對中國當前的糧荒問題，必能本救災如救火的觀念，速籌解救之策。</p>
<p>我們於此，願率直奉吿胡佛專使幾句由衷的話：中國抗戰最久，幸賴國際合作，卒獲勝利，我們對美國特別感謝。今年中國必須克服　饉，視饑饉正不下於曩年的敵人！克服僟饉，其艱困亦正如以往的抗戰，更需要國際的充分合作，而尤其寄託此希望於富有救濟力量的盟邦美國。中國平時每年尙向暹羅越南採辦糧食，爲數甚多，而此次戰後，兩地餘糧均爲英法兩國所壟斷，杜絕其運華之路，使中國缺糧省市，如兩廣上海一帶，只得再向荒歉的內地去辦米，不能如往年平時向暹羅越南採辦餘糧，實在不合情理。我們以作戰盟邦之一的資格，確有權利向盟邦要求，更有權利請美國的糧食專使主持公道，首先來協同打破這種不合理的壟斷行爲。我們願政府與社會向胡佛專使盡量陳述中國糧荒的實况，不必隱瞞；我們更禱祝胡佛專使仁慈偉大的賑濟使命獲得成功！</p>

<p>〔本報東京特派員廿九日專電〕遠東國際法庭首席檢察官季楠今日已將日本主要戰犯二十八名之起訴書呈交審判長魏勃。據法庭書記官長華白列奇今日宣布：偸襲珠珍港日首相東條英機及其他主要禍首嫌疑犯定於五月三日晨十時三十分開庭提訊，由檢察官誦讀起訴書，決定被吿承認起訴事實與否，然後於六月初旬正式開庭審判。法庭官員及首席檢察官季楠今晨曾在日本陸軍省舊址會議三十五分鐘，美海軍上尉柯爾曼將如被吿領導辯護，今日亦被召列席會議。本報記者特訪我國法官梅汝璈，承單獨與本報記者發表談話如次：「本法庭職責雖係審訊主要戰犯，但對於未列入此次控訴內之其他劣跡昭彰之日本軍人及政客，絕無任其逍遙法外之意。誠如麥帥一月十九日指令所稱：聯合國審訊日戰犯工作，仍照常進行。</p>
<p>〔聯合社東京廿九日電〕遠東國際法庭檢察長季楠今日發表聲明稱：日本戰爭犯起訴書所恃爲根據者，即破壞國際法律，無論其爲習慣形成，或條約訂立者，其責任不僅限於實際犯罪之低級人員，即身居高位而決定此項行動之人，亦應負責。依照國際法庭章程，其控案分爲三類，即違反和平罪，習慣的戰爭罪及違反人道罪是也。但起訴時各罪狀之法理根據則盡相同，目前時機已至，應即實行使居高位者對其行動負責之法律原則，國際公法之溉破壞，即因若輩種種決定所致。起訴書中並未包括何種新法律在內。</p>
<p>每案所控罪狀均依照章程規定，重申國際公法。以第二類罪案而論，亦爲各國國內法律，及日本法律所規定。第一類罪案係國際法庭章程第五條甲項及乙項所規定，其中所控各款均係兼指侵略戰爭及違反國際公法。以本案事實而論，此種區別自無關緊要。控案之目五款爲陰謀發動此種戰爭。第一款泛指整個計劃爲一種陰謀，其餘四款則分別申述。第六款至十七款指控各被吿計劃及準備對每個國家分別發動此類戰爭之罪行，第十八款至廿六款指控被吿主動對若干黨派發起此項戰爭之罪，第廿七至卅六款則指控其個別對若干黨派從事戰爭之罪，第二類罪行，係按照章程第五條各節控訴其殺人罪，凡故意殺人而無法律根據者，每一文明國家法律均規定爲謀殺，日本法律亦然。該國法律甚至無需「故意」字樣。依照戰爭法合法之交戰國爲防禦而戰係屬正當，惟控案第三十七，三十八款中指出日本之交戰國資格並不合法，因其破壞條約並具侵略性質，第三十七款中指出其並未宣戰，三十八款中指出其破壞禁止此種侵略之條約，第三十九及四十三款中，指出一九四一年十二月七日至八日各次製擊所發生之謀殺例證，第四十四款指出陰謀在陸海兩方實行或准許大規模謀殺俘虜及平民，第四十五至五十款特別指出歷次著名之屠殺案，如在南京等地。季楠在結論中稱：「起訴書中如遺漏任何人名。並非暗示各該私人將豁免其共謀罪，或以後不再起訴之謂，此層不可不明白瞭解。爲謀此案之起訴便利明瞭起見，此次審訊不得不限制其受審人數，多數主犯業已身死，但起訴書中所列生存之人，根據現有證件，顯爲日本所犯罪行之主要負責者。」</p>

<h3>東條等起訴書內容　臚舉罪狀共達五十五款起訴性質等於告發陰謀</h3>
<p>〔聯合社東京廿九日電〕聯合國今日對東條英機及「黷武軍閥」其他份子廿七人正式起訴，列舉罪狀五十五款，對於珍珠港，香港，上海及菲律濱各地所犯兇殺案尤其犖犖大者。起訴性質等於吿發陰謀，日本在此陰謀中曾與納粹德國及法西斯義大利禍首勾結，以圖把握及窄取世界其餘部份。此項控訴係聯合國檢察長季楠於今晨十一時許向聯合國法庭提出，法庭設於陰沉之陸軍省舊址，他日開審亦在該處。實際起訴可望於日內進行，然後給予被吿以相當時間，準備出庭辯護。起訴狀控告日本軍閥及其文官黨羽，以對十一源告國發動戰爭，企岡發動世界陰謀爲主，並兼及違反戰爭慣例，虐待及兇殺被圈禁敵性國人民戰爭俘虜。被吿以東條爲第一名，以及偸襲珍珠港時一部份閣員。此外爲啓釁戎首海軍參謀長中野大將，及瀋陽事變禍首土肥原等均在其內。罪狀中並提及對蘇作戰陰謀及在太平洋戰爭前數年中對蘇聯之種種侵略行爲。蘇聯對德作戰中，如不表示「實力堅强，」日本必乘隙攻擊其後。</p>
<p>案情回溯至「九一八」時　罪狀分爲三類</p>
<p>觀於被吿名單及其罪狀，案情將回溯至九一八瀋陽事變之時。罪狀中並列入日軍在中國使用毒氣作戰及以雅片毒化中國民族削弱其抗戰意志等款。季楠並附帶聲明稱，依據麥飾今年一月十九日宣言，罪狀應分爲三類，即違反和平罪，習慣的戰爭罪及違反人道罪。因此，罪狀範圍自陰謀控制世界以至虐待戰爭俘虜，無不包羅在內。起訴書續稱：日本人民心理會被所謂日本種族優於亞洲乃至全世界其他民族之有害的觀念，作有系統之毒化。日本議會制度不過爲用以實施大規模侵略之工具，與當時希特勒及納粹黨在德國，法西斯黨在義大利所樹立之制度，如出一轍。日本之經濟與財政資源亦大規模動員，以供義戰爭，致損及日本人民之福利。</p>
<p>內務大臣木戶亦被控告　松井等均在內</p>
<p>前任內務府大臣木戶侯乃日本文官中最有權勢者之一，亦列入被吿被控。其他被吿中有前任首相四人，前任外相兩人，前任大使數人，及戰前黷武團體陸海軍各高級將領。日德義三國條約主要策動者三人，即前外相松岡洋右，前駐德大使大鳥及前駐義大使白烏敏夫亦在其內。前首相中，除東條外，尙有平沼，廣田，小磯三人。前外相重光及降書簽字者梅津亦在其列。海軍高級將領，除中野外，尙有東條內閣海眾大臣島田。此外，尙有土肥原大將，前中國派遣軍司令南京暴行案主角松井大將，一九三七年砲擊長江美艦潘南號及英艦瓢蟲號主角橋本等。</p>
<p>企圖在全世界獲支配權　罪惡罄竹難書</p>
<p>關於陰謀之控訴部份，謂此輩日人與德義勾結，企圖在全世界獲得陸軍海軍政治及經濟之支配權，各在其勢力圈內有其特別支配權。各被吿對於自身及執行其命令之任何人一切行動，應負責任。此輩利用其權力及職位，及其個人之聲望與勢力，實施下列各項政策，以推進把持之陰謀，即非法取用淪陷各國之人力與資源，掠奪公私財產，恣意破壞城市鄕村，超越軍事需要範圍以外。此輩並對束手無援之淪陷國平民，實行連續性大規模之謀殺，奸淫，虜掠，却奪，酷刑及其他種種野蠻行動。陸海軍集團對日政府官員及其機關增加其勢力及控制，設立會社敎導國家主義政策，散布戰爭宣傳，嚴格控制報紙及無綫電台，俾使日本輿論在心理上準備作侵略戰爭，在淪陷各國樹立傀儡政權，與德義兩國締結軍事同盟，用武力以推進日本之擴張計劃。凡此諸端，實爲日本求取世界櫂力之全部歷史，至其驅策人民從事戰爭之種種方法，在審判時即可見分曉。</p>
<p>參謀部自一九二八年起　即已凖備侵蘇</p>
<p>起訴狀緒言中稱：日本軍閥曾有組織的動員其人民，驅之作戰，抑制其權利及議會制度。日本參謀本部自一九二八年起，即已準備對蘇侵略戰爭計劃，亟盼乘機取利，發動戰爭，其重要準備步驟乃爲佔領滿洲，朝鮮亦成爲進攻蘇聯之軍事基地。一九三一年以後，滿洲所造鐵路及公路，均俱有重大軍略意義。關東軍之實力，自一九三一年時僅兩師團，一九四一年已增至十五師團。日本並在各港口設立飛機塲及兵營，以供對蘇聯侵略戰爭之用，白俄對蘇聯之敵意，亦爲衝突之準備。日本復在邊境有組織的製造武裝衝突，並在中東鐵路從事陰謀破壞及恐怖行動。其他罪狀如下：一九三二年－反對蘇聯所提互不侵犯條約；一九三七年攻擊哈桑－蘇泰爾湖；一九三九年越過哈林戈爾河攻擊外蒙人民共和國。日德義三國條約在柏林成立時，松岡曾吿蘇聯駐德大使，謂德國倘若呼援，日本當與納粹並肩作戰而無猶豫。</p>
<p>尊重門戶開放言猶在耳　侵華戰爭隨起</p>
<p>起訴書並撿討日美戰爭背景，認爲連帶影響美國，菲律賓及不列顚帝國，自一九三一年至一九四一年十二月間，因日本在東亞侵略並在外交談判中口是心非，以致美日關係日見惡化。日本在向英美担保「在中國並無領土野心」，並當尊重門戶開放政策之後，即對中國發動侵略戰爭云。</p>

<h3>紛提質詢椅倒桌翻　米市塲大起糾紛　糧食部長召集會議　決將十七家購辦之米交出調劑市場</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕近日米價飛漲，羣惰惶惑，昨晨靑建閣米市塲上，釀成糾紛，市面竟未做開。緣昨晨九時許開始交易時，一般米號，以前日係星期日各米號存底不多，而先曾借得米貸金十萬萬元之米行十七家，事實上已有米糧多批，到達本埠，因即紛紛向此十七家要貨，而此十七家米行負責人之一吳某，因被羣衆認爲故意推諉不允，於是紛起質問，空氣極見緊張，甚至桌翻椅倒，該吳某經警察四人保獲，始得出塲。前日一般推測，均以爲昨日米價必可稍回，不意經此意外，市上遂吏不可收拾，而發生四萬八及五萬以上之新高價。</p>
<p>昨日糾紛發生之後，交易立即停頓。社會局吳局長當即電召該市塲負責人邢志剛及米業公會各常委到局商議，力爲調解，旋即由米業公會常委瞿振華，趕回市塲，向衆勸導，並當塲決定下午同到糧食特派員辦公處，請求將此項米貸金所辦米糧，全部交公會平均分配各米號應市。是時各米號代表發表意見頗多，的可歸納爲下列各點：（一）當局如收回米貸金，必可使米價立即回跌，（二）舉辦米貸金之本意固爲中央體恤民衆，但分派不善，反致刺激市價，不如逕將此款舉辦平糶；（三）澈査此十七家辦米確數。多數米商吿記者稱，彼等確知米貸金發出之時，鄕間米價當祇二萬五千左右。一般規模較小之米行米號，因資本週轉關係，不敢將貨多擱，故前一時期之市價比較平靜。米貸金發出後，難免有若干商人，乘此機會，扳貨不售，因而抬高貨價，從中取利，而各小米號一方面無貨應市，飽受市民指摘，一方面則無從補進，虧蝕不堪，內外交迫，苦不堪言。</p>
<p>下午　記者復至糧政特派員辦公處，得晤萬墨林氏，對米市塲秩序欠佳，頗表遺憾。同時糧政特派員辦公處負責人吿記者稱，此次舉辦米貸金之員的，原爲增加米糧來源，政府處理，亦極鄭重。惟目前上海大小米號總數達二千五百餘家，米行總數達二百餘家，勢不能漫無抉擇，借與貸金，故審定此十七家米行資格之時，亦極謹慎，事前且曾徵求徐寄廎氏之意見。</p>
<p>糧食部徐部長於下午五時許，特召集會議，出席者有徐寄廎吳開先萬墨林等，集議達三小時之久，八時許，並再晋謁宋院長請示，最後決定此十七家米行所辦之米，全部先交至糧政特派員辦公處，由該處負責，斟酌情形，隨時出售，調劑市塲，至外傳米價有已由當局決定每祖三萬八千五百元及三萬七干五百元二種之說，已由本市米業權威方面正式否認。今晨市塲法定恢復，據業中人觀察。今日米價必將回跌，因事實上本市到米極湧，昨日即有一萬餘石到埠也。</p>
<p>昨晨宋院長曾召見糧食部徐部長，并接見聯總負責人奧姆斯丹，對米市漲風有所研討。聞已決定籌劃船隻，俾國外洋米二十四萬噸得儘速運華。米市塲管理委員會亦召集米行米號開緊急會議，決議盡力平抑米價，禁絕投機，並嚴禁不佩證章者入塲交易。</p>

<h3>殘廢榮譽軍人　受終身優恤待遇　榮軍善後副司長報告榮軍現狀</h3>
<p>昨天下午，軍政部榮軍善後司，爲使外界明瞭榮軍現狀，特由該司副司長郁瘦梅，招待新聞界，作詳盡之解釋。</p>
<p>政府是對得起　一般榮譽軍人</p>
<p>他說：憑良心說，政府是對得起一般榮譽軍人的，自蔣主席·陳部長起，無不對此事十分關懷，像軍人受傷後，便加一級授餉，而在佔全國總預算百分之七十的軍費中，用之於處置榮譽軍人善後的，亦佔相當數目。中國政府雖然窮，但對這一問題，決盡力而爲之。在過去，政府不但不准榮軍流落，而且强迫加以收容。如今政府在全國各地設有十所敎養院，二十所臨時敎養院和十一所休養院，以收留各種輕重殘廢的榮譽軍人。依據本年四月十一日所製報吿統計，全國榮譽軍人合計六萬三千八百六十人，內已健愈者二千七百〇八人，殘而已廢者約三千六百人至五千人。</p>
<p>善後處置辦法　擬定實施計劃</p>
<p>政府對於怎樣安置這批榮譽軍人，最近又擬定計劃，且已呈蔣主席核准施行。這辦法可分：（一）殘而全廢，無家可歸者，政府擬按地區，共設五所至八所敎養院，給予終身優待恤遇，收養一生，但此係社會福利事業，故將來當由社會部接辦。（二）殘而不廢者，其中又可分二項處置辦法：一·有家可歸者，當儘量設法遣回，供給路費及交通工具，貸予生活金或授以耕田。二·無家可歸者，又可分數點辦理：或集體授田，與農林部接洽，至內地墾荒，其中五六千名軍官，當根據其教育程度，傷殘程度與興趣，予以轉業訓練，士兵則授以工業訓練，參加社會部指定之工廠工作。此外政府又考慮採用歐美各國之社會保險辦法，以保障彼等職業。</p>
<p>一個重要問題　有關今後民氣</p>
<p>總之處置榮軍善後是一個重要的問題，因爲這有關於社會，有關於國家，更有關於今後民氣。政府假如不好好處置，亦亦對不起他們。聲譽軍人約定義，是抗戰因傷致殘的軍人，受傷後經治愈者，不在其內，彼等均須回歸部隊繼續服役。談起王長喜，他說「政府已命令他回去，並勒令呈報過去募捐的賬目，因爲政府沒有呌他募捐，而對於榮軍，政府亦自有辦法救濟的」。（穆人）</p>
<p>受審之湯淺寅吉，其後爲指定義務律師姜屏藩</p>
<h3>一再虐殺我被俘士兵　日戰犯受軍法審判湯淺寅吉罪惡昭彰</h3>
<p>被告否認罪行對起訴各點一味狡賴</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕八年來橫行我國之日本戰犯，昨日下午二時，開始於極莊嚴肅穆之環境下，受我國軍法審判，此第一名受審之戰犯，爲湯淺寅吉，曾在其任職日軍南上海俘虜收容所管理負時，尅扣軍糧，殘殺我被俘士兵七八人之多。昨日乃面對我國軍事法庭後壁所懸巨幅國旗，戰慄震懼，自食惡果·在我輝煌國徽之前，此猥瑣之罪犯，益形醜惡。決庭前後，由我國最精說之憲兵獨立第三營，負責警衛，秩序井然，肅靜無譁。各法官均戎裝佩劍，極見威儀。中央攝影塲並特派專員攝製電影，爲此大快人心之一幕永留紀念。</p>
<p>林檢察官讀起訴書　湯淺於下午一時半，即自提籃橋拘留所提至候審室候訊。是時旁聽席已吿人滿。二時正，軍事法庭審判長劉世芳，審判官瞿曾澤·陸起·蔣保釐·蔣保廉·曁檢察官林我朋，書記官馮俊岳，翻譯官羅經，義務辯護律師姜屛藩等，先後蒞庭，依次入座後，首由馮書記官起立，宣布開審戰犯嫌疑湯淺寅吉一案。隨即由庭丁將湯淺提押到庭，經審判長詢　姓名·年齡·籍貫·及職業後，即由林檢察官起立，宣讀起訴書。略稱：我國軍第二十七軍在太陽山一役，被俘官兵數百人，三十二年四月間，被日軍運送至該收容所內拘留，四月後受被告管轄。湯淺爲人兇惡暴戾，常尅扣食糧，毆打俘虜，并曾參與殺害蘇台魁等七八名。日寇投降後，被吿即混入僑民羣內潛居，上年十一月七日，爲前被俘士兵蔣扳仁等撞見，扭交憲兵，由淞滬衛戍總司令部解送本庭，被吿對俘虜之虐待行爲，實犯中國海陸空軍刑法第三十八條第七十三條，普通刑法第二百七十一條，依戰爭犯審判辦法第一第二條，同辦法施行細則第十條，刑事訴訟法第二百三十條第一項規定提起公訴。</p>
<p>證人到庭申述罪行　經繙充官繙譯後，劉庭長即开始審訊。湯淺對起訴各點，均一一狡賴，並稱此係一種推想，希望再予詳細調査。繼稱本人任職管理負，上受所長之命，平時工作係指揮俘虜搬運煤炭，以及其他物品。俘虜工作時間並不一定，須視貨物多寡，大的爲每日平均六小時，食糧均有規定，然亦非本人所管。官（問）士兵說你打過他們有沒有？（答）因爲他們偸東西。（問）你打過幾個人？（答）不常打人，記不起了。（問）用什麼東西打？（答）用手打耳光，因爲我不打，則警衛隊打得更利害。（問）說你殺了幾個人有沒有？（答）沒有這回事。（問）說你殺蘇台魁？（答）並沒有。（問）你打人在什麼地方？（答）在搬運時，在收容所或碼頭上不一定。至此，庭上傳證八歐陽臣·蔣振仁·陳明德·余世興，到庭申述俘虜收容所內之灌水·上電·木槍劈刺·驅軍犬狂噬·等等種種非刑慘狀，並目睹其參與殺害少校姚壽卿·上尉錢壽夫·少尉高光銘·李志忠·范文鼎·上士汪精賢·蘇台魁。等七人，及埋藏被害人屍體之地址。訊之湯淺·彼仍答稱。本人並無此種　蠻行動，是項屍體實係俘虜中患肺病死亡者。</p>
<p>尚待調查改期再審　至此庭上再訊被告可有其他有利證據提供，彼無語，末由義務辦護律師姜屛藩起立聲稱：關於收容所行刑事項·係由警衛隊長金井佐藤負責，管理糧食則由木原淸男負責，請庭上傳訊。至四時四十分，庭諭本案尙待調査，改期再審，被吿還押。</p>
<p>湯淺寅吉年三十七歲，日本興益縣人，小學畢業，民國三十年來華，在徐州及上海虹口等地口人所開設之糖果店內任夥計。三十二年八月，入南上海俘虜收容所任管理員，迄投降止。該犯身材矮小，昨衣中式白土布短衫褲，足登黑跑鞋。</p>

<h3>周家渡南發生血案　雜貨店小開一時氣惱　砍斃隣居老叟其父攔阻亦傷　凶手畏罪自盡未果</h3>
<p>昨日下午六時許，周家渡南首四里許曹家宅渡口唐隆興雜貨店小主人唐益三，因在附近廟內敬神時發生氣惱，將祭供之物（猪羊鷄肉）投入浜內。有隣人胡吉鬼，年已七十二，貪圖小利，正將該祭物撈起回家烹食，事被益三所知，回家持菜刀兩把，追趕吉鬼亂砍，頭及兩臂均砍落，胸腹等處亦被亂劈，骨斷陽露，死狀甚慘。乃父唐金貫見子持刀殺人，惶駭異常，上前抱住，並大呼「要殺人先殺我」，致亦被砍六刀。幸不在要害，尙無性命之虞。益三見事態擴大，難逃法網，竟一躍入浦，希圖浮水渡江逃匿。當時該處派出所潘巡長業已趕到，指揮警士二名，開槍數響，該唐益三始行登岸就擒。但其頭胸兩處亦已受刀傷甚重，料係畏罪自砍，勢頗危險。後經送上海仁濟醫院救治，俟稍愈再行提回訊究。</p>

<h3>新聞綱外外寫倫敦</h3>
<p>— 本報十八日倫敦航訊　特約記者雪岩寄</p>
<p>英政府　覆信最紛繁</p>
<p>在英國，人民有事詢問部長，部長照例答覆。如果是議員詢問，更是必須答覆的。答覆過了，就要受質問。三月十五日，就有許多議員對各部答覆遲慢一事提出質問。據說，陸軍大臣覆信最慢，平均每封信的答覆需時六週。殖民部八日，外交部八日，財政部十三日，內政部廿一日，海軍部廿四日，敎育部廿一日，空軍部卅二日，戰時運鹼部三十三日，衛生部廿四日。政府方面，由財政部次長答覆，說答覆遲緩的原因，除了問題本身有時須考慮外，目前人手缺乏，打字員不够，實爲主因。待完全復員後，情况可望改善。他又說：政府各部門，除了要答覆議員的來信外，同時還需要答覆人民的來信，如因欲提前答覆議員的信，而稽滯了對普通人民的覆信，也非公正辦法，必爲下院所不贊成。他說：陸軍部每月需要答覆五千封信，空軍部每月四千封，勞工部，衛生部，每月的各一千六百封，所以政府覆信的工作，是很繁重的。</p>
<p>議員薪將增至千鎊</p>
<p>在作戰期間，英國物價，的漲起了三倍，最遭殃的，當然是薪水階級。但薪水階級中，工人比較好些，他們工資的增加，約略與物價相仿。下級公務員也還好，因爲下級公務員薪給標準，比較有伸縮性，現在實際公務員的起碼薪水，已經提高，所以最低限度的生活，都尙能維持。惟有上層公務員，比較地最苦。有許多與職務有關的應酬開支，非但省不了，而且因爲物價高漲而隨着增加。但他們的收入，却巳達到法定薪給水準的頂點，無可再加。迨去年秋日，實在忍不住了，議員們首先要求加薪，自己在議會中討論起來，結果，送委員會審查。（議員們自己組織）。現在審査已經結束，最近提出報告，認爲要求合理，議員年俸應自六百鎊增至一千鎊。此案待議會中三讀通過後，便可成爲法律。按英國議員的薪水，在一九一一年，爲每年四百鎊。一九三七年，增至六百鎊。今年可望增至一千鎊，其中五百鎊，可免繳所得稅。</p>
<p>旅行社攝宣傳影片　英國現在計劃，自一九四七年起，英國要藉來英旅行的遊客身上，每年增加收入四億美元，即一億鎊。目前因爲各種物資缺乏，交通工具困難，自然難望有很多旅客到英國來旅行。但到明年春日，似乎可以恢復戰前狀態了。英國旅行社（Trevel　Association　ＯfGreat　Britain）現正在計劃攝製八張影片，到全世界各地去放映，作爲宣傳英國現狀，促起旅行興趣的資料。同時，還有一套影片，名爲「兒郞們見過的世界」的，亦在凖備中。內容大概是在各自治領，美國及其他盟國與一切英國士兵足跡所曾到過的地點，選擇風景最佳之處爲背景，穿插英國士兵的生活，製成影片。據說英國旅行收入，在戰前已達每年三千萬鎊，早已超過瑞士與義大利。而僅次於加拿大與法國。戰前法國每年的旅行收入爲八千萬鎊，而加拿大則爲六千萬鎊。</p>
<p>輸入品農產物原料</p>
<p>美國今年的出口貿易，預計約爲二十五億鎊。其中三萬萬鎊是準備銷售於英國的。這三億鎊所欲購買的，是些什麽東西呢？據「每日郵報」說，其中一億零六百萬鎊，是購買肉類·獸脂·家禽之類。三千一百萬鎊，是購穀類·蔬菜·水菓。植物油。啤酒等。四千七百萬鎊，購買人造橡皮·藥料·種籽·烟草等。三千三百萬鎊，購引擎。渦輪。各種建築。運輸。開礦。電氣及實業機器。一千三百萬鎊，購棉花·棉織品·人造絲·人造纖維及各種紡織品。一千一百萬鎊，購木料·木塞·木器·紙漿·紙張等。二千六百萬鎊，購石油·石油副產品·硫質物等。九百萬鎊，購藥物及化學品，包括肥皂·化妝品等在內。英國是工業化甚高的國家，所以她向外國購買的，盡是農產品及原料，除了供給國內需用外，大部分經過再製後，仍將運銷國外。</p>
<p>兩公主倩影常出現當代英皇無子，僅有公主二人。長公主伊利薩伯，按例當爲下代女皇。爲使英國民衆，加深印象起見，現在已開始宣傳。軍艦下水，大典禮開幕等，常請其光臨。而新聞片及照相展覽中，隨處可見其倩影。公主現在正當妙齡，丰姿翩然，英人看了，無不又敬又愛。目前英國的自治領，很多歡迎皇室巡幸。已決定了的，有明年二月的南非之行。其他加拿大聞亦在商請中。澳洲·紐西蘭起來效允，也是說不定的。</p>

<p>工黨當政以後，推行企業國營化計劃，不遺餘力。保守黨雖不斷攻擊反對，但國營化計劃受平民的普歡迎，却是毫無疑問的。衛生大臣裴文(Bevan)，在三月廿二日又提出了醫藥事業國營化的計劃，從此在醫藥史上，又將劃一新時代。按照裴文的計劃，自一九三八年起，英國境內要求醫病的人，不用化錢了。任何人的醫藥費，概由國家負担。其辦法爲把全國劃成廿六區，每區有一衛生中心。由一執行委員會主持當地的衛生事宜。執行委員的組織一半是醫生。藥劑師等所推選的代表，另一半田當地政府及衛生部委派。凡醫院·醫生的聘請，醫校，醫藥經費的管理等，槪由其主持。凡合格的醫生，可以在各處行醫，其薪給概由醫藥中心付給。惟付給的標準，一半是固定的薪水，另一半是依照其所醫治的人數及次數決定。病人可以自由選擇醫生。祇要經醫生證明，住院也不需要付錢。但醫生如不願受雇用，自行行醫也可以，同時病人當然也可以出錢去找醫生。所以這計劃的作用，完全是對平民的醫藥保證。任何窮人，生了病，都可以得到合理醫治。此制實行後，相信私人醫生，很少自立門戶了。（四月十日，倫敦。）</p>
<h3>蘇聯的兩重性格·暴戾·協調</h3>
<p>— 各國抱懷疑態度</p>
<p>蘇聯政策好像是一個極大的矛盾，但其實並不如此。當紅軍開始撤離龐荷爾姆島時，丹麥人喜不自勝。當蘇聯駐兵伊朗時，世人懷疑它有煽動土民叛亂再度引起伊朗騷亂的企圖，但是蘇聯允許在六星期以內退出伊朗，「如果沒有意外發生的話」。蘇聯最高議會，最近又命令六級紅軍在九月中實行復員了。</p>
<p>在此項命令發表的次日，莫斯科電台評論家伏洛寗發出警吿稱：蘇聯「被資本主義國家和反動勢力所包圍着，他們想重行分配世界的慾望可能再度引起武力衝突……」中國最近高興地宣佈：蘇聯已照會中國，允許在五月一日撤離東北。又據加拿大政府透露：蘇聯間諜網份子不但向莫斯科領取盧布，甚至接到過訓令，可囑他們不要坐了馬車直達秘密開會塲所。這一切，初看起來，似乎全是矛盾，但實際上並不。</p>
<p>權力威信安全</p>
<p>蘇聯的又暴戾又協凋的兩重性格，使其他國家感到大惑不解，因爲它們始終對它抱着懷疑態度</p>
<p>蘇聯需要權力；蘇聯需要威信；蘇聯需要安全。蘇聯認爲和平是最好的機會，比帝俄時代所有的，和布爾雪維克在一二十年內可能有的機會更好。</p>
<p>上星期華盛頓方面傳說：留在德國的美國官員，在一九四一年德國進攻蘇聯以前，莫洛托夫與里本特洛甫會談的鈔本內，發見莫斯科計劃的藍本。莫洛托夫要求波羅的海諸國，蘇聯所佔據的波蘭全部，芬蘭的若干地帶，羅馬尼亞東部，對韃靼尼爾海峽的全部控制權，對伊朗和伊拉克的自由處置權，以及阿刺伯的一部份地方，以便控制波斯灣。里本特洛甫認爲蘇聯要求得太多了。</p>
<p>蘇聯目的何在</p>
<p>可是蘇聯自己却認爲它的領土的要求是很正當的。共產主義覺得它的毛病只有自己來醫治纔是最安全的。蘇聯爲了覓取這安全，從一九三九年以來，總共併吞了二七三·九四七方哩的領土－這區域比美國的得克色斯州還要大些。它把邊境上的國家安置在「親善」（亦即馴良的）政府的背後，現在祗有兩個例外的國家，伊朗和土耳其，還受着海洋的壓迫。在蘇聯心目中，甚至伊朗的石油也沒有德黑蘭傀儡政權那樣重要。</p>
<p>蘇聯對於其他若干國家，（例如法國·義大利），暫以感化少數人民爲滿足。此少數人民雖沒有强大實力够得上控制大局，但亦有相當勢力足以遏止蘇聯所認爲多餘的政策。此外，尙有第三集團的國家，（例如印度·西班牙），正遭受共產主義的侵入，大抵因爲它們的現政府還沒有解決急切的政治和社會問題的緣故</p>
<p>蘇聯以懷中疑的目光觀察資本主義和社會主義國家，因此蘇聯維持着全世界最强大的陸軍（至少有六百萬人）。蘇聯寗願把它自已的勢力範圍和世界其他部分隔離，而且已經把東歐和西方的經濟和文化聯繫切斷其大部。但是它却急於要和可能幫助它分割其他勢力結合的國家取得更密切的聯繫，現在它正獻媚於僩人主義的阿刺伯人和法西斯主義的阿根廷人。蘇聯專門利用世界各國的弱點。</p>
<p>參加國際機構</p>
<p>蘇聯的經濟勢力正向着崩潰了的德日工業和貿易所遺留的空隙膨脹着。它的社會制度，雖和數百年的西方進步作對，却得到世界兆民的好感。它的政治手腕是富有自信力的，殘酷無情的，而且是千變萬化的，從軍事恐怖以至於人道主義。它直接間接用無數方式，利用無數團體，來完成它的使命。</p>
<p>蘇聯在有利可圖時　加入國際團體。例如它反對世界航空協定，因爲它不願外國飛機飛到它的領土上空。它沒有加入勃萊頓森林國際貨幣基金協定和聯合國糧食及農業機構，但是却活躍地參加世界工會聯合會。</p>
<p>各國平等原則</p>
<p>但是無論蘇聯懷着怎樣的恐懼和野心，它並不需要戰爭。它雖有攫取的慾望，它對於堅强而一致的反對力量是十分敏感的。蘇聯依然比較美國爲弱，比較整個西方各國更弱得多。如果世界其他各國遵守聯合國憲章，蘇聯的慾望不致於越出軌範的。</p>
<p>上星期史太林對於蘇聯向所反對的聯合國機構措置突然加以讚許：即聯合國機構的注重各國平等原則而排斥一國支配他國原則。史太林謂聯合國機構的未來的偉大繫於平等原則。弱小民族可又用法朗士的反語回答：「法理是大公無私的，它禁止貧者也禁止富者在橋下睡覺，在路上求乞，並偸竊麵包。」但是如果蘇聯不能履行史太林的諾言時，那麼他們也可以找出其他的話來責備蘇聯。（本文譯自四月一日美國「時代」週刋。）</p>
<p>歐洲政局剖解　本報資料室繪　由扵戰時及戰後之亂動，歐洲多數國家政局仍呈動盪不定</p>
<h3>春荒嚴重　野無青草　哀鴻餓殍在皖北</h3>
<p>— 本報廿日訊　蚌埠通訊員錢夢超</p>
<p>刦後的皖北二十三縣，好似一道崩潰的隄岸，長滿了蔓草的慶墟，荒凉而又寂寞。壽懷秀倩的山水，遮掩不住戰火的殘痕，淮河隄兩旁的忠骸，津浦路兩側的荒塚，寫下了永遠塗抹不掉的詩史。素稱出產米麥之鄕的縣份，現在不但幾乎演到十室九空的情况，而且哀鴻遍野，餓殍載道，會令你目不忍覩。在收復區的各省市普遍鬧着靑災的時季，皖北春荒之嚴重，實不下於湘桂等省，茲將春荒情况，分述如次：</p>
<p>災祲頻仍到處鬧着飢荒</p>
<p>日寇盤踞皖北，自去秋投降時截止，前後七年又八個月。縣城能幸而固守沒被攻陷的，僅阜陽一城而巳。但是敵騎已踏入縣境，距城不過卅里。皖北大部份，在淪陷期問受着血腥的統治。敵僞恣意榨取敲吸之外，連年又接續不斷地發生旱災，蝗災，水災，上年黃河奪淮，洪流倒灌，鳳陽五河一帶低窪的地方，水勢汪洋，幾成澤國，不但秋收無着，而去歲八九月間應播種的大小麥，有許多地方到現在還沒能種下，今年午季二麥歉收，殆無疑義。目下偏僻地城，農村幾完全破產，盱眙縣境，如浜澤一帶，則室如懸磐，野無靑草，瀕湖產糧之區尙如此，其他瘠磽山地更可想而已，因此，到處發生饑荒，災民喫樹皮草根，以苟延殘喘的，所在多有。</p>
<p>攤購軍糧皖人痛心疾首</p>
<p>抗戰獲得了勝利，中央亦明知人民已是艱苦備嘗，因特明令豁免淪陷區田賦一年，並且實行二五减租，使實惠及於貧農。皖北老百姓在這一個功令之下，眞是歡聲雷動，大有「含脯鼓腹」之槪。萬不料在這四五個月以後，突有變相的「攤購軍糧」之出現，明說是付給價款，其實有些路程僻遠的縣份，簡直還不够送糧的運費，這眞是一幕滑稽的悲劇。皖省購糧，辦理奇特，糧食部給予約定價，據聞是每市石五千五百元，而皖省只有四千五百元，由省政府發到縣裏，再轉到老百姓手中，經過縣鄕鎭保甲長七八道中間，牙式的折扣剝削，誰也不曉得老百姓究竟獲得若干。糧政人員之貪汚，最爲皖人所痛心疾首。某大員最近之被攻擊，亦爲原因之一，好在中央對於皖省府決定改組，此後皖北人民或有昭蘇之望。惟目前各縣俱鬧糧荒，此時若不統籌急賑辦理，施行救濟，到了靑黃不接的時候，那就更不堪設想了。所以記者在這裏熱烈地希望當局立刻設法籌一妥善的急賑辦法，解救皖北同胞的苦離。</p>
<p>共軍踞擾盱眙受禍最烈</p>
<p>福不雙至，禍不單行，皖北人民在極端的艱苦生活中，偏偏又有共軍盤踞盱眙·五河·泗縣·靈壁·鳳陽·宿縣·定遠·及蘇北一帶，就地索食，糧米的消費，更加可觀。徵發攤派之外，還硬逼着人民去砍電桿，掘鐵路，擔任破壞工作，還督迫它上火綫去，衝鋒陷陣，作砲火下的寃鬼。</p>
<p>單就其中的盱眙一縣而說，災情之慘，爲數百年來所未有。人在飢餓綫上，好似熱鍋上的螞蟻，弄得走頭無路。逃亡他鄕的，爲數已達三萬餘人。該縣旅居明光同鄕會，近以數萬難胞，亟待救濟，除向有關機關曁慈善團體請求賑濟外，並向各界人士籲同情救濟。呼籲文中有：「抗戰軍興，未及半誠，盱眙全境，即成匪窟，爲共軍佔據，縣城一度被敵侵佔，農村仍爲共軍所據。八年來人民，除田地產物盡被共軍侵奪外，生命被其屠戳者，不知凡幾，勝利後，日寇撤後，赤燄遍及全縣，搶奪殺戳，日有所聞，抽丁征夫，拆屋充田，刻無暇晷。現在全縣壯丁，除被某徵調者外，悉數逃亡，田主士紳曁知識份子，除受其殺戳者外，接踵遠　，赤手空拳，寄跡異鄉，住屋既無，衣食并乏，露宿風餐，啼饑號寒，除京，滬，鎮，揚，臨，蚌等埠不計外，僅嘉山縣屬明光一地盱籍難民，不下一千餘戶，五千餘口。此輩雖半爲地主士紳，因被共軍八年魚肉踐踏，生機幾吿斷絕，若不迅予賑濟，必盡葬身溝壑」等語，文字中充滿悲愴情緒，是血。是淚？令人不忍卒讀。</p>
<p>飢餓所迫演成一幕悲劇</p>
<p>蚌埠扼淮河中游，居津浦要衝，綰　朔南，爲皖北重鎭。經過這次大戰，外殻雖備，精神全非。蚌埠淪陷七年以上，人民被剝蝕殆盡，因此元氣大傷。軍興前，蚌埠爲鹽糧薈萃之地，且是皖北貨物吐納塲。現在市面雖　摩踵接，熙往攘來，看商業表面是逐漸繁榮，其實外強中乾。隨意攤派的結果，人民怨聲載道，各各苛捐雜稅，仍是層出窮。近來物價高漲，人們購買力爲之減弱，各業均呈冷落景象。</p>
<p>此間最近發生一幕爲飢餓所迫成之慘絕人寰的悲劇。據悉經一路緯一里，有豫省籍難民王某，一家三口，於去冬來蚌諜生，近因物價高漲，生計艱窘，吿貸無門，該男子於上月二十八日將其親生幼子用繩勒死，然後夫婦雙雙懸樑自盡。事後經人發覺，報由慈善機關施捨棺材，草草掩埋。災民投入都市中謀生之艱窘，由此可見一斑。</p>
<h3>南昌的風風雨雨</h3>
<p>南昌人對於此間一座高大莊嚴的省政府常呌它做「南昌白宮」。白宮內外的柳樹，正在日新月異，欣欣向榮。白宮主人也正在新舊交替，給人們對舊的滿懷離情，對新的深寄厚望。</p>
<p>曹浩森主贛四載有奇，很多人呌他做「曹婆婆」，曹氏在這急需休養生息的復員時期離任，人們的甘棠之思，決不會淡然於懷的。</p>
<p>三村桃爭妍高橋水載愁</p>
<p>三村離市區僅五里許，村上桃花，向以艷著，現正盛開，當局爲便利遊人，早經鳩工修路，近雖天不作美，但雅士們紛往遊賞，去時携點心數色，歸時折桃花幾枝，正是流連光景絕好機會，其奈此種風光，只限於少數雅士才能領略何？</p>
<p>高橋附近，蓬戶林立，該處地窪溝塞，邇來雨師肆虐，蓬戶四週，積水成渠，以致戶內「難民」，出則拖泥帶永，入則霉氣窒息，有人苦笑着說：「問高橋難民能有幾多愁？恰似橋下汚水滾滾流」。</p>
<p>流行病猖獗風災亦可怖</p>
<p>腦膜炎和傷寒，是本市兩大流行病，尤以腦膜炎病的傳染，現已進入猖獗階段，其中主要原因，在於垃圾到處充斥，而公共厠所數量旣少，又極汚穢，加之房缺租昂，人烟稠密，以致空氣惡劣，病菌繁殖。爲患腦膜炎病而死的已大有人在，尤以兒童居多。這不能不說是個嚴重的問題。</p>
<p>但「禍不單行」，本月六日的一陣颶風雷雨，給予了重大的損失。省立第二中學新建校舍全部倒塌，壓斃校工一人，傷學生十一人。</p>
<p>但颶風是「天災」，再來與否，人們祇好聽天由命；腦膜炎等流行病，並非「天災」，有關方面，實不能讓人們定命於天。</p>
<p>救濟失業人贛署遇難關</p>
<p>善後救濟總署贛分署，成立以來，已近五月。「近水棋台先得月」，本市貧民確乎早沾了不少的實惠。例如：散發了麵粉九五六袋，收容了老幼殘廢二百四十人，便是犖犖大者。但這些是消極救濟工作。積極救濟工作，現正着手展開：一是舉辦中小商民小本貸款，規定甲乙二種：甲種十萬元，乙種五萬元。一是舉辦失業救濟，收容失業貧民，予以專業訓練，介紹就業。前者困難較小，後者困難實大，因爲本市現有失業貧民太多了：共有一四五七九人，（內男七三三六人，女七二四三人）。－這無疑是贛分署的一大難關，如何迅速地打破它，就要看該署全體人員，羣策羣力去想辦法了。</p>

<h3>舊金冊特別廣播慶祝清華校慶</h3>

<p>中國復興需要人材</p>
<p>貝氏前爲清華校董之一，在演詞中渠　清華爲『國際合作之模範」，貝氏演詞略謂：『清華的管理，當然一向都在貴國當局的手中，但是這三十五年中，美國政府從未中止對淸華的注意。一九〇八年，美國會把賠款匯到中國，很愉快的，這種行動已有助於清華的建立。同意建立淸華的中美當局，並不知道他們合作的行動，也就是國際合作的預兆。在該時期中，當美學校內討論淸華和中國靑年敎育問題的時候，曾强調需要訓練大批技術人員。目前，一如以往，中國的復興，需要很多很多這一類的人材，一般人都認爲賠款的歸還，將使中國更迅速的獲得更多的專家。最主要的，你們畢業諸君，已經增加了中國的力量，而，在基於國際和平與正義的改造世界工作方面，對於促使中國成爲領袖之一，你們也已盡了很重要的職責。因此，很明顯的，中美合作，把賠款用於敎育方面，不特有利於中國，而且裨益美國和整個世界。國際互惠合作，將產寳貴的成果，在很早以前，淸華已經證實了這原則的眞實性。就是拿目前的世界來講，此種原則採納的結果，已產生了聯合國以及聯合國善後救濟總署，食糧與農業機稱，及聯合國敎育科學文化機構等。你們的美國朋友深信，諸位在這可紀念的日子，循着國際合作新途徑前進，必可用同樣的精神爲中華民國以及全世界光榮的服務。」</p>
<p>中美合作最早努力</p>
<p>陳參議的演詞略稱：「有一個時期，國際關係，祇限於各國政府之間的事務，在過去數十年內，這種觀念不斷在變更中。現在我們已更注重交換文化的工作。我們相信：國際關係的基礎，應建於各民族間的互相諒解。我們相信：這種諒解，的確是維持國際和平的極大的力量。美國國務院，以及美國國會，對於以世界和平爲目的的文化合作，已經擬定精細的計劃。當此項計劃在　國　討論的候，時常都注意到淸華的貢默；清華是這方面最早的努力，目前在中美兩國人民之間，已存有一種互解，促進兩國在戰時及和平時代內的積極合作。這種互解，也是淸華的貢獻之一。因此，今年的濟華校慶，最爲重要，在私人方面，我希望乘此機會向同學們祝賀，同時又盼望濟華經過這次不幸的揷曲之後，能够加倍努力，創立中美的接觸，並且對促進國際諒解應有更大的貢獻，因爲無論如何國際諒解，也就是世界和平的基礎。」</p>

<h3>金獅籃球隊返滬末一塲敗於梁溪</h3>
<p>本市金獅籃球隊於上週五（廿六日〕遠征梁溪，在錫比賽三塲，二勝一負，業於昨日搭夜快車返滬。該隊遠征軍日前在錫旣克白隊，前日上午暢遊惠山名勝，下午復與錫地勁旅賡裕隊交兵，由章文元任裁判，金獅得史久全助陣，益見猖獗，上午半塲結果卅一對十三，遠征軍前導。　　過後，兩陣再圓，金獅生力軍陸續登塲，賡裕隊李有祥，吳宗麟，極爲活躍，但金獅黃存瑞，王蓉生，王炳福，獲分累累，故賡裕卒難超越，結果遠征軍乃以六十五對四十一克賡裕，獲第二次勝利。昨日客軍遊覽名勝　頭渚，下午五時在原處戰梁溪隊，球迷傾港來觀，情况空前熱烈，金獅連日大戰，不免疲乏，且梁溪得卓國榮參加，陣綫更覺充實，裁判宣鶴皋，金獅諸將用命一時，前半完畢，以十二比十小勝。休息一過，再行交兵，梁溪究屬地頭蛇，瞬以十九對十三後來居上，未幾梁溪高保生及金獅黃存瑞先後四次犯規被黜，金獅羣龍無首，難挽頽勢，終以十五比二十四首次失利。</p>

<h3>新生台灣的幹部熔爐　國立海疆學校淡描</h3>
<p>— 林影</p>
<p>自開羅會議決定戰後東北台灣等地重新劃歸中國後，中央爲欲準備他日便利接管台灣以及積極培養海疆專門人才計，這所「國立海疆學校」便匆卒誕生。</p>
<p>海校的產生，在當時多數人士看來是一個『謎」，爲的是那時節國內的戰事正跨入最嚴重階段，東南各省幾乎已完全孤立，勝利的念頭在國民的腦中可以說是淡忘了，誰還曾想到我們在不久將來會重新獲至美麗的合灣！也好中央這個輕輕的措置，多少給常時東南人士挽回一部分的信心，使人們感到政府畢竟是處處爲勝利着想，而海校也便成爲當時東南老百姓們的勝利象徵！</p>
<p>第一個，啣命來福建籌備這所學校的，是仙遊人張兆煥氏，他在三十三年六月抵閩，在短短的幾個月中，靠了莆仙一帶民衆的熱烈贊助，便在他故鄉仙遊把臨時校址勘定了，宿舍和教室都設在原有師管區的司令部內，即期開始招生，當時的名額是兩百名，高中畢業或同等學力的都可投考，惟一的限制是閩南人要佔百分之七十，因爲閩南的語言和台灣同一系統能够自由通話的緣故，按照原有的計劃，海校的規模是相當龐大的，全校計有四部門，編制如下：</p>
<p>一，行政科：設民政，財政，教育，建設等組，目的在培養縣政人員。</p>
<p>二，師範科：設文史，公民訓育，數學等組，目的在造就中小學師資。</p>
<p>三，技藝科：設水產，製糖，造茶，鍊鐵等組，且的在訓練專門技術人。</p>
<p>四，特別科：專辦各種因特殊需要而設的訓練班等。</p>
<p>第一學期，這兒招的僅是行政科的財政敎育兩組各五十名，師範科的文史組一百名，抗戰勝利後因需要變更目標，這兒也酌量减縮和調整，因而，將行政科改爲法商科，服務地點從台灣擴展而至沿海以及南洋各地，師範科則在二年制之下，添設「五年制師範科，招收初中以上學校畢業學生，其他科則察情再行籌設。</p>
<p>原任校長張先生一度調充國立音樂校長，繼長海校的便是閩省參政員梁龍光氏，梁氏是閩南人，在南洋各地辦理黨務敎育達數十年，因而接辦後立刻把校址從閩中移至閩南南安縣屬的九都地方，此地離永春仙遊各地等近，交通還勉强可稱便利，係臨時性質，故設備仍是因陋就簡。</p>
<p>現全校同學計三九十餘人（內五年制師範生一百名），平日均生活在一起，這兒並沒有普通大學那麼自由，「退學」和「記過」學生的事情不時可發見，學生的「待遇」完全由學校發給，每月除按照國立大學公費標準發給食米三十四斤半副食費一千七百五十元外，尙有零用費若干，制服每學年都有一套，師範科同學則更見優渥，可以不必再麻煩家長掏腰包，就是費用較大同學，也不至有「床頭金盡」之處，因而一，海校同學的生活可以說是安定的。</p>
<p>同學的課外活動並不多，較之普通學校這兒多了一個特色，就是第一必需用的語言是閩南話－也就是台灣話，國語在其次，（然而在福建却是每個學生都會說的），第三才是英文，課程方面，除了普通大中學校必修學程外，加了幾科行政管理，敎學概要等。</p>
<p>學生的出路，按例是一律由官方派赴台灣工作，不過此後或許是南洋的可能性較大，爲的是合灣已投歸祖國：此後儘有各項人才前往，而南洋六百萬僑胞却一直處在無依無靠的境地。海校同學在這一方面至少是應該負起敎育和指導的使命的。</p>
<p>復員問題：校址一項，勝利時曾經有人提議將其遷往台灣，後來爲了實際需要情形，中途輟議，根據校務會議決定，是把它遷往厦門的禾山去，那兒傍山濱海，無論在風景，交通，實騐各方面都便利不少，至謂校制的問題，梁校長曾有兩種計劃，（一一）請敎部於校下增設研究科（分史地，移民，和法商三組，修業期限爲兩年，供二年制學業同學服務期滿之後繼續進修。）（二）改爲學院（或法商師範聯合學院）。俾同學有更多機會從事硏讀較深學問，現梁氏已趁此次出席參政會之便赴渝向部商治，諒回來後即可決定。</p>
<p>我們國家的海岸綫是漫長的，然而，幾百年來的疆防是那麽地鬆弛，海校的成立意義是資人驚惕的，海校的前途該不將爲人忽略吧！</p>

<h3>穩定已久之金價　昨日突然狂漲　頂高做一九三萬　配給價開一六八</h3>
<p>烚赤昨飛黃騰達，靜極思動，人心趨勢附炎，南非黃金漲價以及下月起非經中行核准之銀號錢莊禁止買賣外幣現鈔之訊，淺見而敏感者以為外幣需求更難，同時對五月一日起中行種種政策，有動搖之揣測，一經掀起風潮，買戶涌來，此仆彼繼，中行雖極力抑制，無如　起倉猝，中行以一六八萬配給金業八六六條，當日無法可交，須熔化成本　通用條子，最早亦須五時左右方可出爐，凡此等等消息，一經煊染，各色游資羣認有機可乘，以致中行雖正式配給同業外，數次暗中由同盟餘號代為傾售，漲風依然難遏，屢起屢仆，後市曾兩度穿出一九〇萬外，見一九三萬高峰，查晨開即站住一六〇萬上，開後初受美鈔見俏刺激，買戶即已見動，迨穿出一七大關，大部人心對一六中行配售價已不擺在心上，見一七八萬左右，中行有所拋售，多方亦有出籠，曾降至一六八萬左右，經幾次商酌後，中行始以是價如數配出，無何脫股換金，買風普遍發動，一轉瞬間漲勢重起，午刻在一八〇萬內外掙扎，午後因中行當天無貨可交，買戶有恃無恐，中行陸續放出不下千餘條，仍數度越過一九大關，而後轉盤，結果較上週六暴騰二十八萬，飾金十九萬八，紋銀平而銀元稍昇，暗拆以投機銷路突多，自一角三分步升至二角光景，中行所配黃金尚有大半未繳款，今日黃金多頭未知有後勁否。</p>
<h3>公債回跌</h3>
<p>公債環境轉移，報載財部債券抽簽還本，已移滬辦理，多方見機，獲利了結，失去支持，回落殊鉅，統內自晨開七六〇〇元，逐步低落，曾破六關見五八〇〇元低價，午刻在六一〇〇元左右盤旋，結果較上週六回跌一千三，其他亦跟蹤下落一千四。</p>
<h3>花商扳價　現棉交易有限</h3>
<p>昨日紐約美棉電訊報漲九至十二磅音，計近期美金二七·八九，遠期二七·九五，米特林現貨二八·五二，本埠現棉市況受黃金與紗價飛漲影響，花商報價奇高，談判不易接近，至交易欠發展，申新第一廠　有採辦，花號互做仍不寂寞，米特林現貨送廠價迫近十萬元，價比前週六再昂二三千元。</p>
<h3>新旗槍疲跌</h3>
<p>杭州梅家塢所產之旗槍，「色」「香」「味」均佳，為其他各產區出品所不及，今年新貨登場已久，但受本市情況衰落之影響，因此亦逐步軟落不已，日來同業互做價每担跌至三百五十萬元，他若平水·溫州·等龍井，邇日到源益多，貨方咸抱求售心理，以致行市一瀉千里，陳貨花色，蘇州幫暗中吸收不弱，更以天津各地及本街店莊零星染指，大勢尚可支撑。</p>
<h3>各種紗綫飛漲　十支粗紗尤俏</h3>
<p>昨日紗市飛黃騰達，最初在黃金美鈔狂升消息傳來，紗綫亦不甘落後，各支無不飛跳，同時实銷亦極旺盛，各帮相繼吸收，致普遍上漲一成以外，十支粗紗尤俏，聞申市場上求過於供，人心異常興奮，故午時紡建公司開紗，人頭濟濟，同行争先承購，第以粥少僧多，每家廠號所派得之數極為有限，所開之價較上期提高五萬至廿七萬，以四十二支綫所加最多，另有紗綫十種，用投標方式，招商承買，聞由承興昌振大昌正德同茂昌等號及永大染織廠標去七種，尚有四支及五支粗紗，無人投標。</p>
<h3>金價影響所及　絲綢一片漲聲</h3>
<p>昨日絲綢市受金價刺激，一片漲聲，彌漫市場，一二〇號天橋人造絲，開盤一百七十二萬元，收盤一百八十萬元，中途最小做過一百七十萬元，下午又好，做高至一百八十五萬元，其餘各貨均　起十餘萬至廿餘萬元之鉅，廠經洋行貨未曾做開，羅賓漢成交價二百十萬元，其他各檔，俱高十萬至廿萬元之　，綢貨市價，開盤時頗覺平穩，大誠格子緊縐四千〇五十元開盤，漲至二百五十元有成交，後聞原料高漲，遂亦提高至四百元，下午人心更好，喊達四千五百五十元，美亞被商晨間一百二十三萬元有成交，上午一百三十萬元有收盤，下午又做高六萬元。</p>
<h3>燒碱貨缺價漲</h3>
<p>昨日燒碱市面甚為混亂，其原因不出下列數種，烚赤美鈔猛漲，美國定貨到滬甚少，且馬尼刺等地不准出口，本市工廠實銷日增，存貨日枯，市面看好，於是各商號羣起搜購，價由三十萬猛躍至三十五萬，尚無人肯脫手，惟黃凡士林及漂白粉有到貨，價微跌。</p>
<h3>新式車胎問世　美出口數量增加</h3>
<p>〔路透社狄狄特律卄九日電〕固特　車胎橡膠公司宣佈：茲公司最近製成新式車胎一種，胎面係經特別設計者，專供卡車使用，預料于六月份中即可大量製造。</p>

<h3>三湘甘雨　米價大跌</h3>
<p>〔中央社長沙二十八日電〕湘省看來　　，二十七日甘霖沛降，今復竟日傾盆大雨，糧價猛跌，萬民稱慶。</p>
<h3>市場游資轉移目標　華股由堅轉疲　外股亦節節下挫</h3>
<p>華股上場一度承上週六午後餘風，尚形緊俏，迨夫金鈔吃香，引起股國人士興趣，一經將目光轉移，股市游資陸續外流，永紗自六三〇〇元，美亞五三〇〇元，景福五二〇元，新光四六〇元，勤興三九〇元，逐步回落，同時冷門各股反告步漲，中法內衣曾做高至二五〇元以上，火柴一千六，元老股亦有喊高一成者，於是熱門經雙重套費下，永紗退至五六〇〇元，美亞四七〇〇元，景福四七〇元左右，午收稍平，新光勤興則以低價結束，冷門各股終亦不支，高價僅屬懸花一現，間有　落至上週六價格左右者，結果較上週六永紗美亞景福三首熱平平，新光勤興則各跌十餘元，此外信和榮豐平平，中紡大中華則因底子老，有人要，各漲一成半，中法新亞內衣稍有軋升，元老股亦喊高一成光景，午後零星之隔日交易，喊價亦有回好，外股受證券帮放棄股票，轉向金紗活動之影響，亦起回跌，怡紗自一七六〇〇元高價節節步落，惟冷門及小型則取捨不同，前數日跟漲有限，反呈榮辱俱見之象，午收較上週六計怡紗英聯各跌一千元，紙業亞洲　廣微跌，怡啤平，而鍋業稍升，午後喊價熱門續降。</p>
<h3>中砂白七萬元　昨日停止標售</h3>
<p>昨糖市以值標售之期，中砂白公會，劃盤一度曾小至六萬四千五百元，旋以未及出貨，停止標售，價遂復緊，回升至六萬八千五百元，下午更緊，劃六萬九千元至七萬元，比前日稍平，然仍不失堅穩之局，三半平白劃七萬五千元。</p>
<h3>證券從業員要求　恢復自由買賣</h3>
<p>證券業從業員為呼　要求暫准證券自由買賣事，昨　　都花園招待本市各界及各報社記者，當到有社會局顧炳元，市商會王喫籍，中宣部馮有　，證券業同業公會理事長俞　澄，會計師徐永祚，暨各報社記者等數十人，首由該業代表俞明岳致詞，略謂：「該業在證交未開業前，因客方雙方事實上之需要而有買賣之行為，從業員以居間人地位為公眾服務於法理人情實無抵觸之處，奈最近屢為行政當局勒令停業，同人生機頓絕，而有證券之公眾亦感不便，爰特請求各界主持公道，」旋由徐永祚，馮有　，俞　澄等先後起立發言，大都對該業要求之原則表示贊同，社局代表顧炳元則希望該業注意上市股票本身是否合法，及經營證券公司或字號如未向社局登記者，應速補具手續，取得合法地位云。</p>
<h3>買戶爭先恐後　美鈔漲風大熾　較上週六升三百元</h3>
<p>美鈔自二三四〇元開后，即告買戶湧到，爭先恐後，志在必得，　兌業無法應付，有一時期賣買價拔開至相差一百元之鉅，十時後始由二六五〇元以上回落至二五〇〇元以下，無如需求者依然相繼而來，深恐下月份起欲購無從，又回漲至二六八〇元，午刻在二六七〇元左右盤旋，午後金市俏俐，美鈔亦被帶好至二七〇〇元以上，實貨流出亦多，高價難於持久，但人心仍堅，氣勢未回。最後仍在二六五〇元左右，結果較上週六漲起三一〇元，港票因屬冷門，投機氣忿不及金鈔，最瘋狂時亦未能越過四九〇元，且受港　所牽制，雖漲而不多，結果亦漲三十餘元，港電四百六七十，均有結出，羅比五七五元，美匯雖平，但少供給。</p>
<h3>煤市微有波動</h3>
<p>昨煤市初聞金價上升，人心略感興奮，終因實銷有限，復呈疲軟狀態，行情跌多漲少，白煤塊及烟煤塊，去化較呆，市價續見微　，烟煤層本市廠銷雖未推动，但外埠客帮搜購不寂，行情略趨堅穩，白煤小子及煤層則於低檔　持。</p>
<h3>美棉麥均短少</h3>
<p>〔聯合社紐約廿八日電〕美農業部宣布：在新小麥收割之前，國內之小麥較預定需要短少四千四百萬美元，並稱一九四五年之棉花收成為自一九二一年以來之最少者。</p>

<p>資源委員會前所接收之浦東高橋敵偽油棧聯利等三家，近已着手整理，并籌設上海煉油廠，聞以原有油棧　廠址，即將開始煉製汽油柴油。據悉：該三油棧佔地頗廣，設備亦稱完善，將來開始煉製後對於本市汽油當有多量之供給。</p>

<h3>湖南紡織業　戰後產銷概況</h3>
<p>據湖南第一紡織廠陳君稱，湘省紡織專業，戰前由省當局在安江設立第一第二兩廠，有錠子五萬餘，每日可產棉紗三千件，淪陷後，移轉後方，刻已照常開工，因物資及運輸上之困難，暫將第二廠併入一廠，已使用之錠子，約有二萬餘，每日可產紗千餘包，同時尚有布機二百台，照常生產，原料方面，則向湘鄂交界之江枝一帶產棉區採辦，但以機件之陳舊，所產棉布質地較粗，故出品僅以銷售與西南各省之農民為大宗，湘省之軍服，及公務員制服，均由該廠廉價供給，惟目前洋布已有運湘，故本廠產品，當向西北諸省銷售，至由各團體合辦之第三紗廠，因錠子較少，產量亦不　。</p>
<h3>行號雙方起爭執　米市場演全武行　麵粉油豆均回跌</h3>
<p>十萬萬米糧貸款，自糧三泰萬昌等十七家米行承借以後，雖屢傳已有米糧辦到，但米價仍日見上漲，粳秈近且越四萬大關而向五萬進迫，同時本埠米號業公會二千家會員，亦以米行承受貸款辦糧，何以迄今並未分配各號，以應門市，昨日米市場開市時，各米店一致向米行聲請分配糧食米，一時雙方爭執，秩序大亂，　翻椅倒，遂致市場交易無法做開，雙方各派代表向當局請求公判。（詳情請看今日本報本埠新聞。）</p>
<p>昨日麵粉因當局禁止出口，外埠消路停頓，囤戶出籠，市面猛跌三四千元，油市來貨湧旺，店家看望，狂瀉八九千，至近萬元，　皮價小五六百元，尚少受主，豆餅跟小二三百元，生仁下挫二三千元，成交寥寥，惟黃豆因浙閩問津，價升二三千元，苞米紅糧均漲一二千元，赤豆貨稀，南洋略辦，上漲二三千元。</p>

<h3>憨人領導世界前進</h3>
<p>— 楊謀</p>
<p>歷史上沒有憨人，畫部的歷史也許會黯然失色。歲月的推移，原是極平淡的活動的記錄，憨人憨事點綴其間，才使宇宙的生命虎虎有生氣。</p>
<p>多少政治舞毫上活躍的英雄，多少研究室中孜孜不倦的科學家，原祇都憑着一點憨勁，與舊環境舊思想舊系統搏鬥，從絕望的幽谷中開關康莊大道。</p>
<p>成也罷，敗也罷，出發點總是相同的，爲的是堅固的信仰，不拔的憨勁而已，丟云現實的苟安的生活，背起了荊棘的十安架，去找尋理想的實現，世界上面，除了染着憨氣的，恐怕誰也不會幹吧！</p>
<p>固然，理想的夢還距離得渺遠，，自已却已受陵得千瘡百孔，頽然倒下的，書不勝書。但是，在歷史上留下名字</p>
<p>基督的精神，伽利略的精神，都替人類的進程，註下了最光輝的一頁。一切無恥的卑賤的阻撓一都只是徒然的白費心力而已。</p>

<h3>四月五月好辰光</h3>
<p>— 姜建邦</p>
<p>我們只知道每年四月和五月是最適宜於遊玩的季節，不知道四”和五月也正是最利於工作的時候。心理學者吿訴我們，一年中工作最有效率的月份是五月，四月，九月，七月，八月，和三月。效率最小的月份是二月，十二月，十月，一月，十一月和六月。</p>
<p>四月和五月是人類的最大恩人。在這時候，我們的工作最有效率，我們也最喜歡活動。在不寒不暖，風和日煦的情形下，給我們安排了一個最適宜於工作的壞境。</p>
<p>天氣不斷的稍有變化，（連續持久者例外），可以引起活動的興趣和工作的慾望。四月和五月正合這個條件。淸晨和黃昏雖然有些冷意，但到中午，就感到有些熟了。在這種變化中，使我們有了活動的刺激。</p>
<p>世界上許多偉大的著作和發明，都是出於四月和五月。大詩人但丁寫新生是在四月，寫神曲是在三月。米爾頓的失樂園是在某年的四月開始的。歌德寫少年維特之煩惱是在秋天，寫浮士德是在三月，寫色覺論是在五月。達爾文進化論的觀念是萌芽於某年的三月，哥俞布環遊地球的思想是發生在五月，加利略發現土星圈是在四月，發現太陽斑點是在五月，風雨表的發明也在五月。可見在四五月裏，我們的思想最活躍。統計者吿訴我們，世界上偉大的發明以五月爲最多，四月次之。</p>
<p>我國以五月爲多事之秋。除了國際性的五一節以外，有五三，五四，五五，五七，五九，五卅等紀念日。可見五月裏人們活動性的厲害了。</p>
<p>在四月和五月裏，我們的工作最是正確。銀行裏記賬員的錯誤最多是發生在十月，十一月，和十二月裘；錯誤最少的是五月四月和九月。在這些時候，我們的心境愉快，腦子淸爽，最利於工作。</p>
<p>春天來了，我們的身體好像輕快了許多，好像有了勤勞的習慣，不願做的事，這時願做了。懶洋洋的心情會給春神趕走的。</p>
<p>春天是慈母，在她的懷抱裏可以像孩子一樣的跳躍遊玩，享受甜蜜的溫情，但是我們也要用比較嚴肅的態度來過它－－在這個工作最有效率的時候，多做些工作。</p>
<p>今年的四月已去其半；但五月不久即到。桃花憶落，楊柳垂青·換上輕鬆的春服，打起點精神，轉向你的工作吧，莫再蹉跎，失掉這一段最好的時光！</p>

<h3>瀋陽的文化界</h3>
<p>— 陳烟帆</p>
<p>瀋陽的報紙現在共有四種，一是遼瀋日報，一是中蘇日報，另外是靑年日報和「和平日報」。靑年日報是靑年軍二〇七師辦的，但是我還沒有看見過。和平日報比較最有歷史，他的前身是掃蕩報，內容比較最充實一點。最近還有一種大報將要出版，那便是前進報。前進一報是接收了盛京日報改出的，所以設備都相當完善。這　　　原來　在錦州出版，後來因爲環境的需要，乃改來瀋陽籌備。我在十天以前到瀋陽的，本來還要到長春去，可是爲了參加前進報，也許一時便不能離開。</p>
<p>瀋陽的報紙雖然有這一些。可是在街上，幾乎看不到一個報販。像上海那樣到處擺着花花緣綠的雜誌報童的報攤，在瀋陽是沒有的。瀋陽的街上多的是馬車，「得，得……」「有，有……呼喝　馬之聲不絕。沒有到這裏之前，我沒有想到潘陽是這樣個個地方。潘陽的建築市容和地域的寬展，都不比上海弱。北地就是多風，而且地燥，走在街上，時時風沙蔽天，這時候口眾是必不可少的。</p>
<p>爲了目前瀋陽在各方而的重要性，上海和平津各地的記者都差不多已集中到這裏了。申報的韓淸濤先生，一月前我去北鎭縣時他在那邊，後來我在溝帮子時聽說他也在那邊，他到瀋陽恐怕也在我之前。康正平最近亦在此地出現。這裏雜誌之類的刊物幾乎看不見。有也不過二三種。我這十天以來正想籌備出一份綜合半月刋。定名爲「松花江」。自已的期望是很大的，不知道出來之後是什麽樣子。</p>

<h3>The Northeast Problem Has Not Yet Reached an Agreement, Discussions to Continue in Nanjing, Marshall Paid Another Visit to Chairman Chiang Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 29th] Foreign News: Marshall's negotiations on the Northeast issue must first establish a harmonious draft in Chongqing. He hopes that after both parties move to Nanjing to change the environment, the negotiations can be successfully completed in a harmonious and stable atmosphere. Therefore, the departure date has been postponed again. The weather along the Yangtze River has been unfavorable yesterday and today. If the weather clears on the 30th, Marshall may come to Nanjing immediately; otherwise, it will be delayed until the 2nd of next month. Impartial figures in Nanjing generally hope that the Communist army in Northern Jiangsu will no longer greet this peace envoy with gunpowder and bloodshed.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 29th] Chongqing News: The new actions of the Communist army in Northern Jiangsu, when reported to Chongqing, caused a ripple in the Northeast negotiations that were proceeding smoothly. However, due to the government's extremely calm attitude, it quickly subsided. The Northeast negotiations are still in the process of bargaining. It is heard that Marshall's proposed new ceasefire plan, together with the memorandum, includes ten points: (1) a comprehensive ceasefire in the Northeast; (2) the Communist army must not occupy Harbin, and the National army will temporarily postpone its advance towards Changchun; (3) with regard to local political power, both sides will temporarily adopt a reserved attitude and resolve it through consultation; (4) the U.S. ships transporting the National army will adhere to the principle of receiving sovereignty; (5) the Communist army must not obstruct any government actions in repatriating prisoners of war and sending overseas Chinese; (6) restore transportation as soon as possible, and neither side should cut off or divide transportation in the Northeast; (7) after the ceasefire order is issued, both sides will immediately cease fire, which facilitates the start of military mediation work; (8) all troops entering the Northeast from both sides must use the integrated army plan as the principle for organization; (9) after the U.S. troops withdraw from North China, the National army will take over the defense; (10) both sides must stop the propaganda war in good faith.</p>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 29th] Today's Xinmin Bao Chongqing dispatch stated that Special Envoy Marshall has proposed four points to Chairman Chiang and the representatives of the Chinese Communist Party to resolve the serious situation in the Northeast: (1) immediate and unconditional ceasefire; (2) maintaining the status quo of the Northeast regime before the general election; (3) reorganizing the troops in the nine eastern provinces in accordance with the integrated army plan; (4) stop using American ships to transport the Central Army to the Northeast except for the purpose of receiving territory. Regarding the defense zones of the various armies in the Northeast, it will be decided by a three-person group. Marshall also attached a note stipulating that after the U.S. troops withdraw from North China, two divisions of the Central Army will take over the defense. It is heard that the government has agreed to abide by the second point, but insists on receiving Changchun first before the ceasefire order is issued.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 29th] According to the U.S. Information Service, Marshall started a meeting with Zhou Enlai, the representative of the Chinese Communist Party, at 10:30 this morning, and the meeting was still in progress at noon. Marshall is scheduled to visit Chairman Chiang again at Shandong this afternoon for talks.</p>
<p>[United Press, Chongqing, 29th] Special Envoy Marshall has still failed to reconcile the opinions of the government and the Chinese Communist Party, so the war in the Northeast has not been resolved for the time being. Well-informed sources in the Chinese side said that the ceasefire plan proposed by the Democratic League advocates that the Communist army should occupy most of the Northeast, which Chairman Chiang has rejected. He would rather wait until the National army recovers Changchun before ceasing fire. Marshall has now ordered his headquarters to move to Nanjing tomorrow. A spokesperson for the Chinese Communist Party said that the negotiations in Chongqing have ended, and the representatives of the Chinese Communist Party will go to Nanjing in the next few days to continue consultations. Chairman Chiang is expected to go to the capital on May 3rd. Chairman Chiang, Marshall, and Zhou Enlai have discussed various ceasefire methods. The latest ceasefire plan was drafted by the Democratic League and agreed by Zhou and Marshall. It was submitted to Chairman Chiang last night. The suspension of the negotiations shows that the plan has been rejected. Well-informed sources said that the Chinese Communist Party was willing to give up Changchun, Harbin, and the Tiechang Railway a month ago in order to seek a ceasefire, but now it demands a higher price for peace, insisting that the overall situation in the Northeast must be resolved according to the current situation. If so, the area occupied by the Chinese Communist Party will be almost eight-ninths of the Northeast. All parties know that Marshall has done his best to stop the war before the battle for Changchun breaks out again.</p>
<h3>Du Yuming Departs for Inspection, Fierce Fighting Unfolding on the Outskirts of Sipingjie</h3>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 29th] Shenyang Dispatch: Du Yuming has departed from Shenyang to inspect the National army's reception situation. It is not yet certain when he will return to Pan. Zheng Dongguo has long been at the front, and Liang Huasheng is now in Kaiyuan. It is said that there will be fierce fighting in the Liaohe area.</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 29th] Combining news from the government and the Chinese Communist Party, Xin Sipingjie is currently still in the hands of the Communist army. Part of the National army did enter Xin Sipingjie on the evening of the 20th, but withdrew immediately due to the fierce firepower of the defending army. The battle is still ongoing on the outskirts of Sipingjie, and the strength of the two sides is comparable, so the battle has almost reached a stalemate. The battle for the defense of Sipingjie began on April 4, after the National army moved into Changtu. After the 18th, the battle became more intense. Part of the 12th Army under the New First Army advanced along the Changtie Railway from the south and southeast. Another part of the New First Army, in coordination with the 31st Army, advanced from the west and southwest along the Sitao Road, detouring to the northwest of Sipingjie. However, the Communist army's strength is strong, which was quite unexpected to the National army. Therefore, the encirclement could not be gradually reduced, and the two armies are still in a fierce battle.</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 29th] Today, I met a non-official from the Northeast. He personally went to the vicinity of Xin Sipingjie three days ago to investigate the truth of the battle situation. According to him, the reception progress of the National army in the Northeast is very slow because the Communist army used all possible conditions to obstruct it. It is true that two platoons of the National army entered Xin Sipingjie, but they lost contact with the National army outside Sipingjie. He did not dare to determine whether there was still fighting in Sipingjie at the time he left Sipingjie. A part of the vanguard troops of the National army also bypassed Sipingjie and advanced about ten kilometers to the north, but the troops above the second regiment also lost contact with the National army in Sipingjie. He said that there are a considerable number of foreigners in Sipingjie assisting the Communist army in combat with heavy artillery. These foreigners with weapons are former Japanese soldiers who were prisoners of war of the Soviet army.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Beiping, 29th] According to sources from the Chinese side here, torrential rain has fallen on the front line of Sipingjie in the past 72 hours, making it more difficult for the National army to advance. It is said that the roads there have become muddy due to melting snow, and the continuous heavy rain has made it almost impossible to send reinforcements and military supplies. General Zheng Dongguo, who led the New First Army and the New Sixth Army in Burma, is currently commanding military affairs in Sipingjie. According to Chinese sources, the Communist army has not only cut off transportation at Sipingjie and Gongwangling, but also built a strong defense line on the north bank of the Liaohe River.</p>
<p>[Another dispatch] Today, according to the latest military news from Pan, the vanguard of the New First Army is currently launching a fierce attack northward along the Shenchang Railway with a "fan-shaped" tactic. The front line in the Sipingjie area has rapidly expanded to sixty miles.</p>
<h3>Key Personnel for Northeast Reception Arrive in Vladivostok</h3>
<p>Zhang Zuoxiang and Others Arrive in Shenyang from Jinzhou</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 29th] Niu Xianming, Deputy Chief of Staff of the Government of the Military Mediation Department, went to Shenyang to prepare to negotiate the safety of government reception personnel trapped in Changchun.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Nanjing, 29th] It is learned here that seventy senior officials of the Chinese government's personnel sent to the Northeast for reception have arrived in Vladivostok.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 29th] Zhang Zuoxiang, Wang Shuhan, and more than forty other members of the Political Committee of the Northeast Headquarters arrived in Shenyang from Jinzhou today.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Beiping, 29th] Xu Pengfei, Director of the Secretariat of the Northeast Headquarters, completed his official duties in Beiping and flew to Pan this morning, accompanied by Wang Zheng, Deputy Director of the Changtie Railway.</p>
<h3>Yongnian City in Southern Hebei Has Hope of Being Relieved, Two Methods Have Been Agreed Upon: Organizing a Grain Transportation Committee and Replacing Commanders</h3>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 29th] In order to relieve the siege of Yongnian, the Military Mediation Department has agreed on three items, one of which is to replace the leaders of both sides' troops. The government's new candidate went there yesterday, while the Communist side is still considering.</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 29th] Luo Ruiqing, Chief of Staff of the Communist side of the Military Mediation Department, went to Chongqing to report to Zhou Enlai on the investigation of the Northeast by the representatives of the Military Affairs Three-Person Team. He flew back to Zhangjiakou yesterday and will return to Beiping tomorrow.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Beiping, 29th] Yongnian in Southern Hebei has been besieged for a long time. After many days of efforts by the Military Mediation Department, two methods of relieving the siege have been agreed upon: (1) organizing a grain transportation agency to provide relief to disaster victims; (2) replacing the commanders of the troops inside and outside Yongnian City on both sides. A food committee has been jointly formed by the three parties and local people to be responsible for transporting grain and providing relief to residents. Regarding the replacement of commanders, the Eleventh War Zone dispatched a senior staff officer to Yongnian yesterday to take over. The Communist side is asking Liu Bocheng for instructions on the candidate for the new commander.</p>
<h3>The Communist Army Concentrates Sixty Regiments on the Longhai and Jinpu Lines; the Communist Army Attacking Nantong Is Unable to Support and Retreats</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Urgent Dispatch, 29th] Military news: The Communist army has concentrated more than sixty regiments in Hai'an, Rugao, and Nantong-Haimen near Northern Jiangsu, Jiangyan in Taixian, the line from Baitapu to Daxujia on the eastern section of Longhai Road, the territory of Lai'an County in Anhui, ninety li away from Liuhe, and Lincheng on the Jinpu Line, and launched a widespread offensive, claiming to "liberate" Wuzhou (Yangzhou, Taizhou, Tongzhou, Xuzhou, Zhengzhou), and will re-attack the Jiawang Coal Mine. Although the official side does not deny the seriousness of the situation, it is indeed confident in its ability to quell the chaos and respond to changes. The generals who came to Nanjing to preside over training a few days ago have all returned to their defenses. It is heard that Deputy Chief of Staff Bai has arrived in Zhengzhou and will return to Nanjing at the beginning of the month.</p>
<p>[Our Zhenjiang Dispatch, 29th] Since the Communist army occupied the three towns of Guanyinshan, Xingren, and Xiaohai east of Nantong, the National army has actively strengthened its strength and, with the assistance of the air force, began a counterattack at 2:00 pm on the 28th. As of this afternoon, the vanguard troops are only four li away from Xiaohai Town.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 29th] Military news: The Communist army launched a three-pronged attack on Nantong County on the evening of the 27th and at dawn on the 28th. After the National army counterattacked, the Communist army was unable to support and retreated. As of the morning of the 29th, the National army had successively recovered Xiaohai Town and Guanyinshan Town. However, the Communist army's actions in violating the ceasefire order seem to be an attempt to disrupt the security of Nanjing and Shanghai when the National Assembly is about to convene. The military authorities are closely monitoring its development.</p>
<h3>A Record of the Fierce Battle of Changchun</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Changchun, 19th] (Delayed) After the withdrawal of the Soviet army, 30,000 ragged Communist troops have completely occupied Changchun, the capital of the Northeast, today. They are mostly equipped with Japanese rifles and old American Winchester rifles. They had a bloody battle with 9,000 government troops beforehand. Every street and every house has undergone fierce fighting. The battle lasted for six days.</p>
<p>Most of the Communist troops participating in this battle were troops of the Eighth Route Army, commanded by Commander-in-Chief Lin Biao. This battle is extremely important in terms of strategy and politics, because the Communist army's occupation of Changchun has cut off the relationship between the government troops and northern Manchuria, including Harbin, which the Soviet army is scheduled to withdraw from on April 25.</p>
<p>The Communist troops poured into Changchun from four directions, covered by artillery fire. The number was unprecedented in the Northeast. After breaking through Changchun's internal defense line, they forced the National army to retreat towards Datong Square. The National army was squeezed in this square as if they were sardines. They turned six public buildings into defensive fortresses, stuffing windows with old books, municipal archives, furniture, and sandbags, hoping to hold on until the New First Army could arrive from Sipingjie. However, the gunfire from the nearby rooftops forced the National army to retreat to Datong Square, which was only one-fifth of a mile in diameter, resulting in being either swept by bullets or captured.</p>
<p>According to reliable sources, 300 of the 1,500 National army troops made a final struggle in the Central Bank. They died in action during the final charge yesterday. Chen Jiazhen, the Major General Commander of the National army in Changchun, personally led his troops with a pistol in hand. General Chen was shot in the leg and fell to the ground, and was captured by the Communist army.</p>
<p>The six buildings serving as fortresses in Datong Square were successively occupied by the Communist army on Thursday afternoon and evening. The Central Bank, the headquarters of General Chen Jiazhen, finally fell at 9:00 pm.</p>
<p>Eberne, a correspondent for the International Telegraph Agency, and this reporter (Barkat, a correspondent for the Associated Press), visited Mayor Zhao Junmai on Thursday afternoon and were almost trapped inside the Central Bank Building. While we were there, American lend-lease planes piloted by Chinese pilots flew over and dropped ammunition by parachute. I ran to the roof and saw that most of the parachutes landed in the Communist army's area, but by the next morning, all the parachutes had landed within the National army's defense line. At that time, I suddenly realized that the Communist Party was advancing from all four directions, less than a thousand yards from Datong Square. Bullets flew over the roof, hissing, and more and more. The soldiers guarding the sandbags were gradually injured. I found Eberne and Mayor Zhao and hurried downstairs, wanting to return to the Mayor's home. We jumped into a car when a volley of gunfire swept into the field where a large amount of ammunition was stored. One of the bullets hit our car. The wounded were carried away on stretchers, while the retreating National army crowded into the Central Bank Building to prepare for the final defense.</p>
<p>We got into the car and rushed to the mayor's house. About half a li from our destination, three bullets hit our car, but no one was injured. Half an hour later, we looked out of the window and saw thousands of Communist soldiers with rifles and machine guns creeping towards Datong Square, fighting for Datong Square. Our house had become an outpost on the front line, and the National army's bullets were flying towards us. Several Communist soldiers saw the American flag on our roof and smiled at us. In a field next door, they had already begun digging trenches and machine gun nests. Then the Communist Party ran into our house, set up cannons at two windows, and chose targets to shoot at.</p>
<p>They looked at us as if we were rare birds and strange animals in a zoo. Few of them had seen Americans. Most of them thought we were Russians and tried to talk to us in a few Russian words. With the help of an interpreter, we learned that most of them were from the Eighth Route Army from Shandong, as well as a considerable number of New Fourth Army troops. Their clothes were ragged and their shoes were especially shabby, but their weapons, though mixed, could be used in combat. One of the reasons why the National army lacked heavy weapons was that the 4,000 National army troops in Changchun were airlifted from Beiping.</p>
<p>The Communist army's battle for Changchun was divided into five stages: (1) seizing three airfields to cut off the National army's communication in the air; (2) occupying the city's only railway station, so that the Communist army could obtain reinforcements from the north by rail; (3) squeezing the small number of National army troops into Datong Square; (4) attacking them again at Datong Square; (5) sweeping the entire city the next day.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Beiping, 29th] Responsible Communist officials stated today that a joint investigation team composed of a Communist Party member and an American representative revealed that the Communist Party's claim that American aircraft attacked the United Democratic Army in the Sipingjie area was incorrect. It was discovered that what the Communist Party referred to was originally an American aircraft, but it was immediately handed over to the Chinese Air Force in accordance with the post-war agreement. This handover was announced some time ago.</p>
<h3>The Communist Army Destroys the Beining Railway; the Ping-Shenyang Train Is Again Blocked; a U.S. Representative of the Military Mediation Department Is Shot and Wounded by the Communist Army</h3>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 29th] Amidst the fierce fighting in the Northeast, the Communist army resumed its movement to sabotage the National army's military transport, destroying the Beining Road. At 11:00 pm last night, the Communist army suddenly attacked the Jiangjia signal station (south of Suizhong) on the Guandong section of the Beining Road. As of this morning, it was still in fierce battle with the defending army. At the same time, Bridge No. 349 at Wanjia Tun and Qian Suo Wen was also damaged by 20 meters, so the Ping-Pan army was again blocked. The New First Army military train scheduled to depart from Qinhuangdao to Pan today was temporarily cancelled.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 29th] Military news: Lieutenant Colonel Grief, the U.S. representative of the 26th Group of the Military Mediation Department stationed in Chaoyang, was traveling in a jeep to inspect the area near Dong Guanyingzi, forty-five li west of Beipiao. When passing through Dong Guanyingzi and advancing half a li north of Xiaobagou, after the National army made many contacts, the Communist army did not believe it and opened fire, killing one local villager who was guiding the way. Lieutenant Colonel Grief was also injured.</p>
<h3>Ambassador Gu Visited President Song Yesterday to Discuss Current Diplomatic Issues; After Visiting Graves in Jiading, He Will Fly to England to Resume His Post</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, This City] Dr. Gu Weijun, our country's ambassador to the United Kingdom, accompanied by Secretary Liu Xuancui, flew from Chongqing to Nanjing on the 27th. That evening, they took the night express train and arrived in Shanghai on the morning of the 28th. Yesterday afternoon, Mr. Gu visited President Song and discussed current diplomatic issues. At 11:00 AM, he met with reporters. Despite the fatigue of several days of travel, he was still in high spirits. It is said that Mr. Gu will go to Jiading to sweep graves in the coming days. After a brief stay, he will fly from Shanghai to England to resume his post. The following is a selection of the contents of Mr. Gu's remarks:</p>
<p>The Holding of the Peace Conference is Not Far Off</p>
<p>The recent meeting of the four foreign ministers in Paris is a prelude to the world peace conference and is attracting worldwide attention. When asked by reporters about his observations, Ambassador Gu said that the main topic of the four foreign ministers' meeting was to discuss the basic principles of peace and to resolve some practical issues of the European Axis satellite states. Since the London Five Foreign Ministers Meeting, the Moscow Three Foreign Ministers Meeting, and the Five Foreign Ministers' Representatives Meeting, concrete solutions to these problems have not yet been reached. I believe that the countries at this meeting will be able to reach a satisfactory agreement in the spirit of mutual concession and understanding, thereby stabilizing the international situation in Europe and further stabilizing the world situation. Apart from the Anglo-Siamese treaty, no other peace treaties have been concluded since the war. It has been almost a year since the collapse of the Axis powers, and the wise men of the United Nations are hoping that a world peace treaty will be produced as soon as possible. We ourselves also share this ardent hope. The convening of the Paris Peace Conference should not be far off.</p>
<p>Next, regarding the issue of the new League of Nations and the international trusteeship system, Mr. Gu said that the two United Nations agencies have had detailed discussions on the international trusteeship system in previous meetings. The principles and purposes of the trusteeship have been stipulated in the United Nations Charter, but the implementing agency has not yet been determined. It is possible that a trusteeship committee will be established at the United Nations General Assembly in September of this year to be responsible for hosting it. When asked by reporters whether the Montreux Convention is applicable at present, Mr. Gu explained that the treaty has been in place for ten years, and in order to maintain international permanent peace, it may need to be revised or changed in the future.</p>
<p>Atomic Energy Should Be Used Rationally</p>
<p>The reporter then asked Ambassador Gu that people around the world have different views on the application of atomic energy, advocating secrecy and openness. What is the proper view? The Ambassador explained that in order to solve the general problem of atomic energy, there is already an organization of the Atomic Energy Control Commission internationally, organized by eleven countries of the League of Nations Council and twelve countries including Canada. The main tasks of the committee are four: (1) Exchange of scientific knowledge, (2) Application of atomic energy for peaceful production, (3) Restricting the use of atomic energy weapons by various countries, (4) Banning and punishing all acts that violate the principles of atomic energy control, but the overall application of the atomic energy program has not yet been established. There is no doubt about the future supply of atomic energy for scientific production, but it will still take considerable time.</p>
<p>Regarding the promotion of Sino-British trade, Mr. Gu said: Trade between China and Britain began the earliest in history and has never been interrupted. After this war, Britain is making every effort to restore production and hopes to increase foreign trade. Our country has long advocated trade cooperation with friendly countries. The future development of trade between the two countries is foreseeable, but some specific issues still need to be mutually understood and jointly resolved by the authorities of the two countries. Mr. Xian also mentioned the Hong Kong issue, believing it to be a political issue, which will surely be resolved concretely after a considerable period of time.</p>
<p>Agrees with the Food Conservation Movement</p>
<p>Talking about the world food distribution issue again, Mr. Gu said: Food shortages have become a widespread phenomenon. This year, India, Australia, South Africa, and other countries have all suffered droughts, with insufficient harvests and reduced exports. After the establishment of the Anglo-American-Canadian World Food Management Committee, they even believed that our country is an agricultural country, so it was not sufficiently allocated. In fact, our country imported a large amount of food every year before the war to alleviate famine. Since this war, the lack of food has been more serious than in European countries. For the purpose of purchasing food, I was one week late in returning during the Second Plenary Session, and consulted in detail with the British authorities. It is expected that after the autumn harvest, our country will be able to obtain more food supplies. Recently, the Ministry of Food has telegraphed the whole country to implement a food conservation movement, which I strongly support. Currently, Britain, the United States, and other countries are also restricting brewing and implementing food conservation. Finally, when asked by reporters about the Northeast issue, Mr. Gu said: Our country is located among the great powers. Solving the Northeast issue is not limited to diplomatic channels. At present, the government is making its best efforts, adhering to a certain policy, and seeking a reasonable solution within the scope of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Treaty. I firmly believe that a concrete solution can be obtained in the shortest possible time. At this point, the reporters bid farewell and left.</p>

<h3>Mei Siping's Investigation Concluded; Public Trial in Nanjing Within Five Days; Capital High Court Prosecutor's Office Filed a Public Prosecution</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 29th] The Capital High Court Prosecutor's Office concluded its investigation into the case of Mei Siping colluding with the enemy to plot resistance against our country. A public prosecution was filed on the 29th, and a public trial is scheduled to be held within five days. It is reported that President Qian will personally serve as the presiding judge. This is the first public trial of a traitor since the restoration of the capital, and it is expected to cause a sensation throughout the city.</p>
<p>[Further Telegram] Mei Siping colluded with the enemy to plot resistance against our country. The main points of the indictment filed by the prosecutor of the Capital Court are as follows: Defendant Mei Siping, male, 50 years old, from Yongjia, Zhejiang, residing at No. 42 Beiping Road, Nanjing (currently in custody). Criminal facts: The defendant was originally a member of the Chinese Kuomintang and served as the magistrate of Jiangning Experimental County and the administrative inspector of Jiangning District. After the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, the defendant went to Hong Kong. In mid-November of the 27th year, he secretly went to Shanghai with Gao Zongwu and negotiated five basic conditions for peace that would cede power and humiliate the country with Major Sazo Teisho and Lieutenant Colonel Imai Takeo, who were sent by the Japanese side. He secretly presented them to traitor Wang Jingwei in Chongqing. Enemy chief Konoe Fumimaro immediately issued a statement based on this. Traitor Wang Jingwei therefore betrayed the central government, fled to Hanoi, and issued the "Glamorous Telegram" in response. On April 15 of the 28th year, the defendant and Zhou Fohai went to Shanghai to promote "peace," gathered party members, and on June 1, flew to Tokyo with traitor Wang Jingwei to secretly discuss peace conditions with the enemy chiefs. After returning to Shanghai, he participated in the puppet National Congress. After the outbreak of the European War, the defendant participated in the negotiations of the "Sino-Japanese Peace Plan" in November of the same year. On January 20 of the 29th year, he attended the Qingdao Conference and negotiated the merger with the Restoration and Provisional Second Government. On March 20 of the same year, he reopened the political conference and presided over the guiding principles for adjusting the new Sino-Japanese relations and the establishment of the puppet central government. After the establishment of the puppet government on March 30, the defendant served as a member of the puppet Central Political Committee, a standing member of the puppet Kuomintang Central Executive Committee, and a member of the puppet National Defense Supreme Committee. He also served as the Minister of the puppet Ministry of Industry and Commerce and Chairman of the Food Committee. After the reorganization of the puppet Ministry of Industry and Commerce, he succeeded as the Minister of the puppet Ministry of Industry and the Chairman of the puppet Zhejiang Provincial Government, as well as the Minister of Interior and the Director-General of the Anti-Smoking Bureau. After Japan's surrender, he was arrested by the Military Affairs Committee's Investigation and Statistics Bureau and transferred to the investigation department. Evidence and the laws violated: The defendant admitted to the initial peace talks with the enemy and to serving in various positions in the puppet government. Moreover, he has the "Complete Account of the Peace Movement" and other books and various report records of the puppet organization, which are sufficient to prove that he has the act of colluding with the enemy, which is very obvious. As for the defendant's claim that "we not only did not resist our country, but also assisted in the War of Resistance and rescued the people in the occupied areas," it is obviously a fabricated defense in light of the above-mentioned facts and evidence. Moreover, while serving as the Chairman of the puppet Food Committee, the defendant collected more than 153,000 stones of military grain for the enemy (see the book "Overview of the Puppet Government's Administration" published on March 30 of the 31st year). He also participated in the puppet government's decision to declare war on Britain and the United States, and was clearly in a hostile position with the central government. How can it be said that he never resisted our country, and what assistance can there be in the War of Resistance? In summary, it should be recognized that the defendant committed the crimes of Article 2, Paragraph 1, Clauses 1, 5, and 10 of the Regulations for Punishing Traitors, and should be prosecuted in accordance with Article 1 of the Special Criminal Case Litigation Regulations and Article 235, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Procedure Law.</p>
<h3>Hebei High Prosecutor's Office Interrogating Major Traitors; Nanjing is Collecting Evidence of Jiang Zhengqing's Crimes</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 29th] Shu Disheng, the deputy officer of the security team of the puppet Fengxing County, was sentenced to two years and six months in prison by the Anhui High First Branch Court on the 27th. Seven traitors, including Yu Jun, Wang Liqi, Fang Ruiwu, Song Monong, Xie Chexun, Chen Houji, and Li Shaoru, are being interrogated by the court.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Beiping, 29th] The Hebei High Prosecutor's Office began interrogating mutual traitors on the 29th. Those who were interrogated today were You Bolu, Chi Zongmo, Luo Jin, and Wan Zhaozhi.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 29th] The news that a Nanjing city councilor recently reported the problem representative Jiang Zhengqing has spread throughout the country. Because Jiang automatically resigned as a National Assembly representative, Nanjing citizens generally believe that Jiang is guilty and afraid of punishment. Relevant authorities believe that Jiang has committed serious crimes as an economic traitor and are collecting evidence to prepare for reporting him. It is said that Jiang has already written a confession of up to 10,000 words. Jiang's past crimes, which were first disclosed in the newspaper today, include: (1) During the enemy-puppet period, he colluded with North China traitor merchants to traffic drugs, which was cracked by Lin Bosheng. (2) After the Japanese surrender, he bribed officials to become the director of the Chamber of Commerce Preparatory Committee. However, according to anti-traitor personnel, Jiang also committed the serious crime of directly funding the enemy with military materials, which cannot be denied.</p>
<h3>Archbishop Cai Ning Arrived in Nanjing</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 29th] Archbishop Cai Ning, the Vatican's representative to China, and Lu Yian, the new director of the Nanjing office, arrived in Nanjing at 4:00 PM on the 29th. They then met with priests and church members and gave a speech, briefly stating: This is his third visit to Nanjing. He is especially pleased to be in China at the time of its victory and return to its capital. He also said: Since the government moved its capital to Chongqing, he has not come here after Bishop Yu Bin left Nanjing, because the puppet government of Wang Jingwei is not something that we can recognize. Cai will stay in Nanjing for about ten days and will then go to Hong Kong to inspect church affairs.</p>
<h3>National Federation of Commerce and Industry Preparatory Committee Meeting Rescheduled to Early Next Month</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 29th] The enlarged preparatory meeting of the National Federation of Commerce and Industry was originally scheduled to be held in Nanjing on April 28. Because the date of the return of the capital is approaching, the meeting should be held after the return of the capital, as the Federation is composed of national vocational groups. It was decided to postpone the meeting to the 8th of next month. In addition, Lin Nengzheng, the representative from Taiwan who will attend the meeting, has arrived in Nanjing. Lin is the first representative of the people from Taiwan to come to Nanjing since Taiwan's restoration. When our newspaper reporter recently interviewed Mr. Lin, he said that the biggest difficulty in Taiwan at present is the transportation problem. Due to the inconvenience of transportation, contact with the motherland is reduced, resulting in a sense of separation. Taiwan suffered a typhoon disaster last year and a drought this year, so there is a severe shortage of food. The price of rice once rose to 20 Taiwanese dollars per catty. After the efforts of the Food Adjustment Committee, it has now returned to 18 yuan per catty. Now, the 6 million people of Taiwan are all rejoicing at returning to the motherland and are working hard to learn the national language so as to accept the culture of the motherland.</p>
<h3>Eisenhower in Hawaii</h3>

<h3>Total Number of Chinese Rickshaw Pullers Exceeds 100,000; Livelihood More Important Than Humanity</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Hankou, 29th] The municipal authorities here have a plan to abolish rickshaws in consideration of humanity, which has caused extreme panic among rickshaw pullers and owners. They recently jointly hosted reporters, saying that livelihood is more important than humanity. Currently, more than 100,000 people in Wuhan rely on rickshaws for a living. If their livelihoods are lost, it will inevitably lead to a tragedy.</p>
<h3>Ma Zhanshan Waiting for Orders to Enter Manchuria; Granted an Exclusive Interview by Our Newspaper in Beiping, Willing to Serve the Country Despite His Old Age</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 29th] Ma Zhanshan (see photo) is currently staying in Beiping waiting for orders to go to Manchuria. Currently, the two divisions of his former command in Datong have been handed over to He Yuding and reorganized into one army under He's command. He is adamant about resigning from his position as deputy commander of the Twelfth War Zone. General Ma gave an exclusive interview to our newspaper reporter at his residence in Beiping yesterday. He said that he had been summoned by Chairman Chiang three times during his trip to Chongqing, who inquired in detail about the situation in Manchuria. The central government plans to send General Ma back to work in Manchuria, but the title has not yet been decided, because all issues in Manchuria must be determined by Marshall and others. Mr. Ma said: After the September 18th Incident, he had a fleeting moment of resistance. After the July 7th Incident, he was deeply grateful for Chairman Chiang's care, which allowed him to fulfill his long-cherished ambition of resisting Japan. He feels very fortunate. Now that the War of Resistance has been won, he deeply wishes to devote his remaining years to serving the country. However, he is humble and incompetent. If he has the opportunity to cooperate with Zhang Zuoxiang, Wan Fulin, Zou Zuohua, Li Du, and Su Bingwen, it will definitely be beneficial to the overall situation in Manchuria. At this point, Mr. Ma added: In the future, it is almost impossible to divide Manchuria, because the strength of the National Government has increased with each passing day during the nine years of the War of Resistance, and the complex environment in Manchuria is well understood by the general public. He believes that the key to the current Manchurian problem is how to prevent the puppet Manchurian army from interfering in the civil war and how to win over the people of Manchuria. He firmly believes that if the government has appropriate policies, the Zhang Xueshi department of the Communist army will lay down their weapons. General Ma is sixty-two years old this year and is in high spirits, no less than when the reporter visited him in northern Shaanxi last year, but he is shorter and fatter, and his wrinkles have increased. He is currently residing in Beiping, quietly waiting for the development of the situation in Manchuria to decide his next move.</p>
<h3>He Guoguang Discusses the Situation of Opium Suppression in Xikang in Chongqing</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 28th] This morning, a reporter interviewed He Guoguang, Director of the Xichang Provisional Headquarters, who arrived in Chongqing yesterday, and talked about the situation of opium suppression in Xikang. He said that the government has long been determined to implement the opium suppression policy. Xikang has a relatively low level of culture, which makes the implementation of this policy difficult. However, after years of continuous efforts, the banning of planting and smoking has gradually approached the ideal stage. Only the area from Ningyuan District to the south, where Han and Yi people live together, has a very low cultural level, which cannot be implemented with a single order. Therefore, the government has decided to adopt other effective measures to promote the ban in these areas. At present, opium seedlings have disappeared in the Han Chinese residential areas of Ningyuan District. In the areas where Han and Yi people live adjacent to each other, they have begun to be eradicated under the supervision of the army, which is expected to be completed in the short term. As for the vicinity of the Daliang Mountains and other places where purely Yi people reside, this is the only obstacle to the implementation of the ban. In order to thoroughly implement the ban, the government is determined to implement it strictly and complete the opium suppression work in the short term.</p>
<h3>Army Motorcade Arrived in Nanjing from Kunming Yesterday</h3>
<p>A Journey of Fifteen Hundred Miles</p>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 29th] A Chinese Army motorcade, which departed from Kunming and traveled 1,500 miles, arrived in Nanjing today. This is the first Chinese Army motorcade to enter the recovered area. It consists of 240 jeeps and is an advance team from the Kunming Automobile Training School. The school will relocate to Nanjing in its entirety. The first task is to pick up and drop off National Assembly representatives. The motorcade originally planned to complete the entire journey from Kunming to Nanjing in 15 days, but due to insufficient gasoline supplies along the way, it took two months to reach the capital. The Automobile Training School was established in Ramgarh, India, four years ago and was instructed by the U.S. Army. Since this year, it has been under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Military Affairs. Its entire equipment, including 300 trucks, is supplied by the U.S. Since its establishment, it has trained 1,820 officers and 18,128 soldiers. In the future, it will train 2,000 drivers and 400 mechanics per term.</p>
<h3>Taiwanese Compatriots in Thailand Have Not Yet Regained Freedom</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Bangkok, 27th] The 540 Taiwanese compatriots detained in Thailand were deemed enemy Japanese nationals after the British came here and were detained. Now that Taiwan has returned to China, their status has also changed. The delegation led by Li Tiezheng mentioned the issue of their release two days ago, but the British authorities here said that they must consult the Southeast Asia Allied Headquarters in Singapore. The crux of the matter is that although our government has regarded them as compatriots, other Allied governments still regard them as Japanese. It seems that our government should promptly draw the attention of the Allied governments through diplomatic channels.</p>

<h3>Welcoming Special Envoy Hoover to China</h3>
<p>Former U.S. President Herbert Hoover, in order to investigate the world's food crisis, will be flying to China from the Philippines today and is expected to arrive in Shanghai this afternoon. Mr. Hoover's visit to the East is in his capacity as Chairman of the American Emergency Relief Committee and as President Truman's special envoy for food, to study the world's food situation. Mr. Hoover is particularly well-suited for this task. After World War I, Mr. Hoover made indelible contributions to alleviating the food crisis in Europe. Twenty years later, after another great war, Mr. Hoover, despite his advanced age, tirelessly travels the globe to study and solve the food crisis, and his compassionate heart is truly admirable. China, in particular, has a deep understanding and friendship between the Chinese people and this outstanding leader. Mr. Hoover resided in China for a period in the past. This time, he returns to this familiar land, but the Far East is no longer what it was. China has emerged victorious from eight years of long and arduous war. The wounds are deep, and the scars have not yet healed. All efforts for post-war relief and rehabilitation still need to be actively launched. Mr. Hoover's arrival at this juncture, we respectfully express our heartfelt welcome to this outstanding statesman!</p>
<p>Speaking of the food crisis, China has suffered a severe food shortage due to the protracted war, the reduction of manpower, the devastation of farmland, the destruction of transportation, and the decline in agricultural production. This is an inevitable result of war. "A year of famine always follows a great war" is common knowledge. Even in peacetime, China, despite being called an agricultural country, still relies on imports of agricultural products from abroad. A review of the import figures for rice and wheat in the customs records will reveal the truth. Moreover, after eight years of bloody war, all of China's grain-producing areas, except for Sichuan Province, have been battlefields. The severity of China's current food crisis is self-evident. Although Minister of Food Xu still claims that food is available everywhere to reassure the people, the earnest appeal of Jiang Tingfu, Director of the Executive Yuan's Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, at the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration conference represents the truth. However, while Director Jiang's appeal won sympathy from all parties, the actual results failed to meet China's urgent needs. This time, Mr. Hoover comes to China as a special envoy for food, and we firmly believe that he will quickly develop relief measures with the concept of treating disaster as if putting out a fire to address China's current food crisis.</p>
<p>Here, we would like to frankly offer a few heartfelt words to Special Envoy Hoover: China has resisted the longest and, fortunately, won the victory through international cooperation. We are especially grateful to the United States. This year, China must overcome famine, viewing famine as no less than the enemy of the past! Overcoming famine is as difficult as the previous war of resistance, requiring full international cooperation, and placing particular hope in the Allied nation of the United States, which has the power to provide relief. China normally purchases a large amount of grain from Siam (Thailand) and Vietnam every year. However, after the war, the surplus grain in both places has been monopolized by Britain and France, blocking the route for its transportation to China. This forces grain-deficient provinces and cities in China, such as Guangdong, Guangxi, and Shanghai, to buy rice from the impoverished inland, instead of purchasing surplus grain from Siam and Vietnam as in previous years, which is truly unreasonable. As a wartime ally, we certainly have the right to demand this from the Allies, and we have even more right to ask the U.S. food envoy to uphold justice and first help break this unreasonable monopoly. We wish the government and society to fully present the reality of China's food crisis to Special Envoy Hoover, without hiding anything. We further pray that Special Envoy Hoover's compassionate and great relief mission will be successful!</p>

<h3>Principal Japanese War Crimes Are Obvious; Formal Indictment Is Filed; Tojo and 27 Others Will Face Justice; Preliminary Hearing Set for the Third of Next Month</h3>
<p>[Our Tokyo Correspondent, 29th] The chief prosecutor of the International Military Tribunal for the Far East, Keenan, today submitted the indictment of 28 major Japanese war criminals to Presiding Judge Webb. According to Whiteley, the secretary-general of the court, the initial hearing for Hideki Tojo, the Japanese Prime Minister who launched the attack on Pearl Harbor, and other major suspected ringleaders, is scheduled to begin at 10:30 AM on May 3rd. The prosecutor will read the indictment, and the defendants will decide whether to admit the facts of the indictment. The formal trial will then begin in early June. Court officials and Chief Prosecutor Keenan met at the former site of the Japanese Ministry of the Army for 35 minutes this morning. U.S. Navy Captain Coleman will lead the defense of the defendants and was also summoned to attend the meeting today. This reporter interviewed Judge Mei Ruao of our country, who stated exclusively to this reporter: "Although the duty of this court is to try the major war criminals, we will not allow other notoriously wicked Japanese military and politicians who are not included in this indictment to go unpunished. As MacArthur stated in his directive of January 19: The Allied nations will continue their work of trying Japanese war criminals as usual."</p>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 29th] International Military Tribunal prosecutor Keenan issued a statement today, saying that the indictment of Japanese war criminals is based on the violation of international law, whether it is formed by custom or established by treaty. The responsibility is not limited to the lower-level personnel who actually committed the crime, but also to those who hold high positions and decide on this action. According to the charter of the International Military Tribunal, the cases are divided into three categories: crimes against peace, customary war crimes, and crimes against humanity. However, the legal basis for each count is the same. The time has come to implement the legal principle that those in high positions are responsible for their actions. The destruction of international public law is due to the decisions of these people. The indictment does not include any new laws.</p>
<p>The counts in each case are restated in accordance with the charter of the International Military Tribunal. Regarding the second category of crimes, they are also stipulated by the domestic laws of various countries and Japanese law. The first category of crimes is stipulated in Article 5, paragraphs A and B of the charter of the International Military Tribunal, which refers to both aggressive war and violations of international public law. In terms of the facts of this case, this distinction is irrelevant. Count 5 of the indictment is the conspiracy to launch such a war. The first count generally refers to the entire plan as a conspiracy, and the remaining four counts elaborate on it separately. Counts 6 to 17 accuse the defendants of planning and preparing to launch such a war against each country separately. Counts 18 to 26 accuse the defendants of initiating this war against several parties. Counts 27 to 36 accuse them individually of engaging in war against several parties. The second category of crimes is accused of murder in accordance with the articles of Article 5 of the charter. Every civilized country stipulates that intentional homicide without legal basis is murder, as does Japanese law. That country's law does not even require the word "intentional." According to the laws of war, a legitimate belligerent is justified in fighting for defense. However, Counts 37 and 38 of the indictment point out that Japan's belligerent status is not legitimate because it violates treaties and is aggressive. Count 37 points out that it did not declare war, and Count 38 points out that it violated treaties prohibiting such aggression. Counts 39 and 43 point out examples of murders committed during the attacks on December 7th and 8th, 1941. Count 44 points out the conspiracy to carry out or allow large-scale murders of prisoners of war and civilians by land and sea. Counts 45 to 50 specifically point out the famous massacres, such as those in Nanjing and other places. Keenan concluded by saying: "If any names are omitted from the indictment, it does not imply that those individuals will be exempt from their conspiracy crimes or that they will not be prosecuted in the future. This must be clearly understood. For the convenience and clarity of prosecuting this case, the number of defendants must be limited in this trial. Most of the principal offenders have already died, but those listed in the indictment who are still alive are, according to the existing evidence, the main responsible parties for the crimes committed by Japan."</p>

<h3>List of Twenty-Eight War Criminals</h3>
<p>The complete list of the twenty-eight war criminals indicted is as follows: Araki Sadao, Doihara Kenji, Hashimoto Kingoro, Hata Shunroku, Hiranuma Kiichiro, Hirota Koki, Hoshino Naoki, Itagaki Seishiro, Kaya Okinori, Kido Koichi, Kimura Heitaro, Koiso Kuniaki, Matsui Iwane, Matsuoka Yosuke, Minami Jiro, Muto Akira, Nagano Osami, Oka Takazumi, Okawa Shumei, Oshima Hiroshi, Sato Kenryo, Shigemitsu Mamoru, Shimada Shigetaro, Shiratori Toshio, Suzuki Teiichi, Tojo Hideki, Togo Shigenori, Umezu Yoshijiro.</p>
<h3>Contents of Indictment Against Tojo and Others: Listing Fifty-Five Counts of Crimes; Nature of the Indictment Equivalent to an Accusation of Conspiracy</h3>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 29th] The United Nations today formally indicted Tojo Hideki and twenty-seven other members of the "militaristic clique," listing fifty-five counts of crimes. The homicides committed in Pearl Harbor, Hong Kong, Shanghai, and the Philippines are particularly emphasized. The nature of the indictment is equivalent to an accusation of conspiracy, in which Japan colluded with the masterminds of Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy to seize and usurp the rest of the world. The indictment was filed by the United Nations Chief Prosecutor Keenan at the United Nations Tribunal, located at the somber former Army Ministry building, where the trial will also be held in the future, around 11 AM this morning. The actual indictment is expected to proceed within days, after which the defendants will be given adequate time to prepare their defense. The indictment accuses the Japanese military and their civilian cohorts of initiating wars against eleven plaintiff countries, primarily for initiating a world conspiracy, and also for violating the conventions of war, and abusing and murdering confined enemy nationals and prisoners of war. Tojo is listed as the first defendant, along with some members of his cabinet at the time of the Pearl Harbor attack. Also included are Admiral Nagano, the Chief of Staff of the Navy who initiated the war, and Doihara, the mastermind of the Mukden Incident. The charges also mention plots to wage war against the Soviet Union and various acts of aggression against the Soviet Union in the years before the Pacific War. Had the Soviet Union not demonstrated "strong strength" during the war against Germany, Japan would have seized the opportunity to attack them from behind.</p>
<p>Case History Traced Back to the "September 18th" Incident; Charges Divided into Three Categories</p>
<p>Judging from the list of defendants and their crimes, the case will trace back to the time of the September 18th Mukden Incident. The charges also include the Japanese army's use of poison gas in China and the use of opium to poison the Chinese nation and weaken their will to resist. Keenan also stated that, according to MacArthur's declaration of January 19th this year, the charges should be divided into three categories: crimes against peace, conventional war crimes, and crimes against humanity. Therefore, the scope of the charges ranges from conspiracy to control the world to the abuse of prisoners of war, encompassing everything. The indictment continues: the minds of the Japanese people were systematically poisoned by the harmful notion that the Japanese race was superior to other races in Asia and even the entire world. The Japanese parliamentary system was merely a tool used to implement large-scale aggression, similar to the systems established by Hitler and the Nazi Party in Germany and the Fascist Party in Italy at the time. Japan's economic and financial resources were also mobilized on a large scale to serve aggressive warfare, to the detriment of the welfare of the Japanese people.</p>
<p>Interior Minister Kido Also Accused; Matsui and Others Included</p>
<p>Former Minister of the Imperial Household Kido, one of the most powerful civilian officials in Japan, is also listed as a defendant. Other defendants include four former prime ministers, two former foreign ministers, several former ambassadors, and senior generals from the army and navy of the pre-war militaristic group. The three main architects of the Tripartite Pact between Japan, Germany, and Italy, namely former Foreign Minister Matsuoka Yosuke, former Ambassador to Germany Oshima, and former Ambassador to Italy Shiratori Toshio, are also included. In addition to Tojo, the former prime ministers also include Hiranuma, Hirota, and Koiso. Former Foreign Minister Shigemitsu and Umezu, who signed the surrender document, are also on the list. Among the senior naval commanders, in addition to Nakano, there is also Shimada, the Minister of the Navy in Tojo's cabinet. Also included are General Doihara, General Matsui, the commander of the former China Expeditionary Army and the protagonist of the Nanjing Massacre, and Hashimoto, the protagonist of the 1937 shelling of the U.S. gunboat Panay and the British gunboat Ladybird on the Yangtze River.</p>
<p>Attempting to Gain Dominance over the Entire World; Countless Crimes</p>
<p>Regarding the conspiracy portion of the indictment, it states that these Japanese individuals colluded with Germany and Italy to attempt to gain military, naval, political, and economic dominance over the entire world, each with its special dominance within its sphere of influence. Each defendant shall be responsible for all actions taken by himself and anyone executing his orders. These individuals used their powers and positions, as well as their personal prestige and influence, to implement the following policies to advance the conspiracy of domination: illegally seizing manpower and resources from occupied countries, plundering public and private property, and wantonly destroying cities and villages beyond the scope of military necessity. These individuals also engaged in continuous large-scale murders, rapes, pillages, robberies, tortures, and other barbaric acts against helpless civilians in the occupied countries. The army and navy groups increased their power and control over the officials and institutions of the Japanese government, established companies to teach nationalistic policies, disseminated war propaganda, and strictly controlled newspapers and radio stations, in order to psychologically prepare Japanese public opinion for aggressive warfare, establish puppet regimes in occupied countries, conclude military alliances with Germany and Italy, and use force to advance Japan's expansion plans. All of these points are, in fact, the entire history of Japan's quest for world power, and the various methods by which it drove its people to engage in war will become clear during the trial.</p>
<p>General Staff Preparing to Invade the Soviet Union Since 1928</p>
<p>The introduction to the indictment states that the Japanese military clique had systematically mobilized its people, driving them to war and suppressing their rights and the parliamentary system. The Japanese General Staff had been preparing plans for aggressive war against the Soviet Union since 1928, eagerly awaiting an opportunity to take advantage and launch the war. An important preparatory step was the occupation of Manchuria, and Korea also became a military base for attacking the Soviet Union. The railways and highways built in Manchuria after 1931 all had significant military strategic significance. The strength of the Kwantung Army increased from only two divisions in 1931 to fifteen divisions in 1941. Japan also established airfields and barracks in various ports for the purpose of aggressive war against the Soviet Union. The anti-Soviet sentiment of the White Russians was also in preparation for conflict. Japan also systematically created armed conflicts on the border and engaged in conspiracy, sabotage, and terrorist activities on the Middle East Railway. Other crimes include: 1932 - Opposing the Soviet Union's proposed non-aggression pact; 1937 - Attacking Hasan-Sutyr Lake; 1939 - Crossing the Halingol River to attack the Mongolian People's Republic. When the Tripartite Pact between Japan, Germany, and Italy was established in Berlin, Matsuoka told the Soviet Ambassador to Germany that if Germany called for assistance, Japan would fight alongside the Nazis without hesitation.</p>
<p>Respect for the Open Door Policy Still in the Air, the Invasion of China Followed</p>
<p>The indictment also reviews the background of the Japanese-American War, believing that the relations between the United States and Japan deteriorated between 1931 and December 1941, due to Japan's aggression in East Asia and its duplicity in diplomatic negotiations, which affected the United States, the Philippines, and the British Empire. Japan launched an aggressive war against China after assuring Britain and the United States that it had "no territorial ambitions in China" and would respect the Open Door Policy.</p>
<h3>Shigemitsu and Umezu Escorted to Sugamo Prison Yesterday</h3>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 29th] Most of the important Japanese war criminals are detained in Sugamo Prison, but at least six were not in prison this morning, and another seven had committed ritual suicide to escape indictment. In addition, Togo Shigenori, a former member of Tojo's cabinet, and former Prime Minister Hiranuma Kiichiro, were not in prison due to illness. Those named in the indictment who were en route home from Bangkok include former Kwantung Army Chief of Staff Itagaki and former Burmese Japanese Army Commander Kimura. Those who should have been indicted but had already committed suicide include Konoe Fumimaro, Honjo Shigeru, Sugiyama Gen, and former Minister of Health Koizumi Chikahiko.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Tokyo, 29th] Shigemitsu Mamoru and Umezu Yoshijiro were escorted to Sugamo Prison today to await trial.</p>

<h3>Fierce Quarrel at the Rice Market with Questions Raised, Chairs Upset, and Tables Turned; Minister of Food Convenes Meeting, Decides to Surrender Seventeen Merchant's Rice for Market Adjustment</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Recently, the price of rice has soared, causing widespread panic. Yesterday morning, a dispute erupted at the Qingjian Pavilion Rice Market, and the market did not open. Around 9 AM yesterday, rice merchants, because it was Sunday and their stock was low, demanded rice from the seventeen rice merchants who had previously borrowed 100,000,000 yuan in rice loans and had, in fact, received several batches of rice in Shanghai. One of the responsible persons of these seventeen rice merchants, Mr. Wu, was accused by the crowd of deliberately shirking his responsibilities. As a result, the crowd questioned him fiercely, and the atmosphere became extremely tense, with chairs and tables overturned. Mr. Wu was escorted out of the market by four policemen. Prior to yesterday, the general expectation was that the price of rice would fall slightly yesterday. Unexpectedly, this incident occurred, making the market situation uncontrollable and causing new highs of 48,000 and 50,000 or more.</p>
<p>After yesterday's dispute, trading immediately stopped. Director Wu of the Social Affairs Bureau immediately telegraphed Xing Zhigang, the person in charge of the market, and the standing members of the Rice Industry Association to the bureau to discuss the matter and mediate. Subsequently, Qu Zhenhua, a standing member of the Rice Industry Association, rushed back to the market to persuade the crowd and decided on the spot to go to the office of the Food Commissioner in the afternoon to request that the rice purchased with the rice loans be entirely handed over to the association for equal distribution among the rice merchants for market supply. At that time, the representatives of the rice merchants expressed many opinions, which can be summarized as follows: (1) If the authorities recover the rice loans, the price of rice can be immediately brought down. (2) The original intention of holding the rice loan program was for the central government to show concern for the people, but the distribution was not well managed, and it actually stimulated the market price. It would be better to use this money to carry out a price stabilization program directly. (3) Thoroughly investigate the actual amount of rice purchased by these seventeen rice merchants. Most rice merchants told reporters that they knew that the price of rice in the countryside was only around 25,000 when the rice loans were issued. Small rice shops and merchants dared not hoard too much stock due to capital turnover, so the market price was relatively stable in the previous period. After the rice loans were issued, some merchants inevitably took this opportunity to hoard goods and not sell, thereby raising prices and profiting from it. On the one hand, small rice shops had no goods to supply the market and were criticized by the citizens. On the other hand, they could not replenish their stock, suffering unbearable losses and being caught in a dilemma.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, the reporter went to the office of the Food Affairs Commissioner again and met Mr. Wan Molin, who expressed regret over the poor order in the rice market. At the same time, the person in charge of the office of the Food Affairs Commissioner told reporters that the original intention of holding this rice loan program was to increase the source of rice supply, and the government handled it with great seriousness. However, the total number of large and small rice shops in Shanghai currently reaches more than 2,500, and the total number of rice merchants reaches more than 200, so it is impossible to lend money without any selection. Therefore, the qualification verification of these seventeen rice merchants was also very cautious, and Mr. Xu Jilou's opinion was sought in advance.</p>
<p>Minister of Food Xu specially convened a meeting around 5 PM in the afternoon, attended by Xu Jilou, Wu Kaixian, Wan Molin, and others. The meeting lasted for three hours, and around 8 PM, they further visited President Song for instructions. The final decision was that all the rice purchased by these seventeen rice merchants should be handed over to the office of the Food Affairs Commissioner first, and the office would be responsible for selling and adjusting the market at any time, depending on the situation. As for the rumors that the authorities had decided on two kinds of rice prices, 38,500 yuan and 37,500 yuan per dan, the authorities in the Shanghai rice industry have officially denied them. The market will legally resume this morning.

<h3>Former Chiefs and Other Pseudo-Officials: Zhou Yuying on Trial Yesterday Denies Being Chief Representative at the Literary Congress, Felt Like Being Driven Around "Like a Dog"</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Zhou Yuying, a native of Liyang, 43 years old, residing at No. 12, Lane 542, Baike Road. Previously worked in the Central Party Headquarters of the Chinese Kuomintang. In the spring of the 30th year of the Republic (1941), through the recommendation of traitor Ding Mocun, he joined the puppet government, serving as a specialist member of the Social Enterprise Committee of the puppet Central Political Committee, and as the director of the Translation Committee of the puppet Ministry of Social Affairs and the Ministry of Transportation, editing public bulletins and engaging in enemy propaganda. He also attended the pseudo Greater East Asia Literary Congress in Japan under the guise of a chief representative. In the spring of the 32nd year of the Republic (1943), he was reassigned as Director of the General Affairs Department of the puppet Ministry of Social Welfare and Director of the Population Administration, among other positions. In the summer of the same year, he came to Shanghai, serving as the Director of the Shanghai Office of the puppet Ministry of Social Welfare, and the Director of the Promotion Department of the puppet Chinese Social Enterprise Association. In the autumn of the following year, he was again reassigned as the Director of the puppet Shanghai Municipal Social Welfare Bureau.</p>
<p>After the victory of the War of Resistance, he was arrested by the Investigation and Statistics Bureau of the Military Affairs Commission and transferred to the High Procuratorate for investigation. He was subsequently prosecuted under Article 2, Paragraph 1, Item 1 of the Regulations for the Punishment of Traitors. The case was heard at the Provisional Criminal Court of the High Court at ten o'clock yesterday morning. The defendant was dressed in a black serge long robe and black leather shoes. His face was full, and he still retained his former demeanor. When questioned by Judge Cao Jun, Zhou remained composed and confessed without reservation to all the pseudo-official positions he had held as accused by the prosecutor. However, regarding the attendance at the pseudo Greater East Asia Literary Congress, he denied ever serving as the chief representative. According to him, his attendance at the conference was entirely the result of a "kidnapping-style" invitation from the pseudo Central Propaganda Department and the enemy's embassy in the puppet government, with Zhou Huarun serving as the head of the delegation and Qian Fusun as the deputy. He himself did not understand Japanese and was unwilling to talk much with his fellow travelers, so he did not know where he was going or what cities he was visiting. He said that it felt "completely like being driven around like a dog," with no enjoyment whatsoever.</p>
<p>He has already drafted a lengthy defense statement of over ten thousand words while in prison, which he read aloud in court. The main points were: (1) He originally met traitor Ding at the Xinguang Bookstore, and only saw him again due to debt collection. Joining the puppet government was only intended to influence Ding for good. (2) He engaged in social welfare to serve the poor. (3) During his tenure in the pseudo-official position, he sowed discord between the enemy and the puppets. (4) He did not engage in propaganda for the enemy. Finally, he requested to meet with journalists and submit his manuscript for review, which was not granted by the court. The news稿 (manuscript) was also retained by the judge. In conclusion, he indirectly stated three points: (1) Traitors should be killed. (2) This case is a miscarriage of justice. (3) He appealed to the press to uphold justice. Judge Cao ruled that the case required further investigation and ordered a postponement for further hearing.</p>
<p>Jiang Guozhang, a native of Wuxi, 35 years old, residing at No. 50, Lane 1285, Avenue Joffre, previously assisted his father in operating the Hongxing Iron Company at No. 883, Suzhou Road, Shanghai. Later, he raised funds himself to establish the Lian Da Iron Company on Zhejiang Road. In April of the 31st year of the Republic (1942), he further combined with foreign investment to establish the Shanghai Iron Manufacturing Factory at No. 214, Lane 614, Rue Robert, serving as its manager. He produced three tons of round and strip steel per day, which was used for military construction by the enemy. However, according to Jiang's statement, all that he produced was supplied to local handicraft industries and was never used to资 (aid). Judge Cao ruled that the case required further investigation and ordered a postponement for further hearing.</p>
<p>Zhang Yuting, a Shanghai native, 28 years old, a farmer, residing in Jiangwan, with no family property. He formerly served as a staff officer and inspector in the puppet Shanghai Municipal Security Command. After an inquiry, the hearing was postponed.</p>
<p>Wang Zuying and Others Scheduled for Sentencing. Those whose cases were heard in the afternoon included Wang Zuying, a member of the detective squad of the puppet police bureau, Li Wenhan, a tax inspector of the puppet customs, Wang Deqing, a laborer of the puppet Central China Transportation Company, and Zhang Zhiyou and Wu Jiaqi, organizers of the puppet "rickshaw association." Zhang Jinming, et al. Relying on the power of the enemy and the puppets, they oppressed and arrested innocent people. After Presiding Judge Liu Yugui, together with Judge Cao Jun and others, convened a collegiate panel and interrogated them one by one, the appointed defense attorney, Chen Zhen, made a plea, raising two points: (1) The pseudo-official positions held were extremely minor, and (2) they were forced to do so out of necessity for survival. Therefore, he requested the court to show leniency. The court ordered sentencing at 2:00 PM on May 6.</p>

<h3>Li Ze Questioned This Afternoon</h3>
<p>(Our Newspaper's Report) The case of Li Ze, the general manager of the New-Asia Company, which has been delayed for a long time, will be continued to be heard at the High Court at 2:30 PM today. Yesterday, Chen Tingrui, Li Ze's defense lawyer, told reporters: The reason why Li Ze's case has been delayed until now is that the High Court wants to seriously investigate the evidence submitted. However, the New-Asia Company employees who reported the case stated: The High Court ordered the accusers to investigate Li Ze's assets, but after the report was submitted, it has not been seized, which they find very incomprehensible. The case will be heard by a collegiate panel today, and both sides may submit further evidence. If the debate can be concluded today, the date of sentencing may be within the next week. Moreover, the puppet officials Liang Hongzhi, Zhou Bangjun, Zhu Boquan, Xu Weizhen, Guo Jianhong, etc., were brought out from prison by the High Procuratorate for investigation yesterday.

<h3>Disabled Veterans Receive Lifetime Preferential Treatment. Deputy Director of Veteran Affairs Reports on Current Situation of Veterans</h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, the Veteran Affairs Department of the Ministry of Military Affairs, in order to clarify the current situation of veterans to the outside world, specially invited the press, with Deputy Director Yu Shoumei of the Department providing a detailed explanation.</p>
<p>The Government Treats Veterans Fairly</p>
<p>He said: In good conscience, the government treats veterans fairly. From Chairman Chiang and Minister Chen onwards, everyone has been very concerned about this matter. For example, soldiers who are injured receive a one-grade salary increase, and a considerable amount of the military expenditure, which accounts for 70% of the total national budget, is used for the resettlement of veterans. Although the Chinese government is poor, it will do its best to solve this problem. In the past, the government not only forbade veterans from being destitute but also forced them to be accommodated. Now the government has established ten educational and rehabilitation institutions, twenty temporary educational and rehabilitation institutions, and eleven sanatoriums across the country to accommodate veterans with various degrees of disability. According to the report statistics prepared on April 11 of this year, there are a total of 63,860 veterans in the country, of which 2,708 have recovered and about 3,600 to 5,000 are disabled.</p>
<p>Resettlement Measures to be Implemented</p>
<p>The government has recently formulated a plan on how to resettle these veterans, which has been approved by Chairman Chiang for implementation. This method can be divided into: (1) Those who are completely disabled and have no home will be given lifelong preferential treatment and care in the five to eight educational and rehabilitation institutions that the government plans to set up in each region. However, since this is a social welfare undertaking, it will be taken over by the Ministry of Social Affairs in the future. (2) Those who are disabled but not completely disabled can be divided into two categories for treatment: One, those who have a home to return to should be sent back as much as possible, provided with travel expenses and transportation, and given a living allowance or taught farming. Two, those who have no home to return to can be handled in several ways: or collectively assigned land, contact the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry to reclaim wasteland in the interior. Among them, 5,000 to 6,000 military officers will be given retraining according to their educational level, degree of disability, and interests, and soldiers will be given industrial training to participate in work in factories designated by the Ministry of Social Affairs. In addition, the government is also considering adopting the social insurance methods of European and American countries to protect their occupations.</p>
<p>An Important Issue Concerning Future Public Morale</p>
<p>In short, the resettlement of veterans is an important issue because it concerns society, the country, and even more so future public morale. If the government does not handle it well, it will also be unfair to them. The defined veterans are soldiers who were disabled due to injuries during the War of Resistance. Those who have recovered after being injured are not included and must return to their units to continue serving. Speaking of Wang Changxi, he said, "The government has ordered him to go back and ordered him to submit the accounts of past fundraising because the government did not ask him to fundraise, and the government has its own way to help veterans."

<p>Yuasa Torakichi, on trial, later had Jiang Pingfan appointed as his public defender.</p>
<h3>Japanese War Criminal on Trial for Repeatedly Abusing and Killing Our Captured Soldiers, Yuasa Torakichi's Crimes Are Obvious</h3>
<p>Defendant Denies Crimes and Evasively Denies All Charges</p>
<p>(Our Newspaper's Report) The Japanese war criminals who have wreaked havoc in our country for eight years began to be tried by our military court in a solemn atmosphere at 2:00 PM yesterday. The first war criminal on trial was Yuasa Torakichi, who, while serving as the manager of the Japanese Army's South Shanghai Prisoner of War Camp, embezzled military rations and killed as many as seven or eight of our captured soldiers. Yesterday, facing the huge national flag hanging behind the wall of our military court, he trembled in fear, reaping the consequences of his evil deeds. Before our glorious national emblem, this despicable criminal looked even more ugly. Throughout the trial, the most elite Third Independent Battalion of our country's military police was responsible for security, and the order was well-maintained and quiet. The judges were all in military uniform and wearing swords, showing great dignity. The Central Photography Studio specially sent a commissioner to make a film to commemorate this heartening scene forever.</p>
<p>Prosecutor Lin Reads Indictment. Yuasa was brought from the Tilanqiao Detention Center to the waiting room for questioning at 1:30 PM. At this time, the audience seats were already full. At 2:00 PM sharp, Military Tribunal Presiding Judge Liu Shifang, Judges Qu Cengze, Lu Qi, Jiang Baoli, Jiang Baolian, Prosecutor Lin Wopeng, Clerk Feng Junyue, Translator Luo Jing, and Public Defender Jiang Pingfan, et al. arrived at the court one after another and took their seats in order. First, Clerk Feng stood up and announced the opening of the case of war criminal suspect Yuasa Torakichi. Then, the court attendant brought Yuasa into the court. After the presiding judge inquired about his name, age, origin, and occupation, Prosecutor Lin stood up and read the indictment. It roughly stated: Several hundred officers and soldiers of the 27th Army of our country were captured in the Battle of Taiyangshan. In April of the 32nd year of the Republic (1943), they were transported by the Japanese army to the camp for detention, and in April they were under the jurisdiction of the defendant. Yuasa was cruel and violent, often embezzling food and beating prisoners. He also participated in the killing of Su Taikui and seven or eight others. After the Japanese surrendered, the defendant mixed into the overseas Chinese community and lived in hiding. On November 7 of last year, he was encountered by former captured soldiers Jiang Banren et al., who handed him over to the military police. He was sent to this court by the Songhu Garrison Headquarters. The defendant's acts of abusing prisoners violated Article 38 and Article 73 of the Criminal Law of the Chinese Army, Navy, and Air Force, Article 271 of the General Criminal Law, Article 1 and Article 2 of the War Criminals Trial Regulations, Article 10 of the Implementing Rules of the same Regulations, and Article 230, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Procedure Law.</p>
<p>Witnesses Testify to the Crimes in Court. After being translated by the translator, Judge Liu began the trial. Yuasa denied each and every point in the indictment and claimed that it was a kind of speculation, hoping for a more detailed investigation. He continued that his job as a manager was under the command of the warden, and his usual job was to direct prisoners to transport coal and other goods. The prisoners' working hours were not fixed and depended on the amount of goods. The average was six hours a day. Food was regulated, but it was not under his control. (Question) Did the soldiers say you beat them? (Answer) Because they stole things. (Question) How many people did you beat? (Answer) I don't often beat people, I don't remember. (Question) What did you use to beat them? (Answer) I used my hands to slap their faces because if I didn't beat them, the guards would beat them even more severely. (Question) Did they say you killed several people? (Answer) That's not the case. (Question) Did you say you killed Su Taikui? (Answer) No. (Question) Where did you beat people? (Answer) During transportation, at the camp or on the pier, it wasn't fixed. At this point, the court summoned eight witnesses, Ouyang Chen, Jiang Zhenren, Chen Mingde, and Yu Shixing, to testify in court about the torture in the prisoner of war camp, such as waterboarding, electric shocks, bayonet practice, and driving military dogs to bite, and witnessed him participating in the killing of Major Yao Shouqing, Captain Qian Shoufu, Lieutenant Gao Guangming, Li Zhizhong, Fan Wending, Sergeant Wang Jingxian, Su Taikui, and others, as well as the address where the bodies of the victims were buried. When questioned, Yuasa still replied. I did not have this kind of barbaric action. The bodies were actually those of prisoners who died of lung disease.</p>
<p>Pending Further Investigation, Rescheduled for Another Hearing. At this point, the court asked the defendant if he had any other favorable evidence to provide. He was silent. Finally, public defender Jiang Pingfan stood up and stated: The execution matters in the camp were the responsibility of the guard captain, Kinei Sato, and the food management was the responsibility of Kiyoo Kihara. Please summon them to court. At 4:40 PM, the court ordered that the case was still pending investigation and rescheduled the hearing, and the defendant was remanded in custody.</p>
<p>Yuasa Torakichi is 37 years old, from Kii County, Japan, a primary school graduate. He came to China in the 30th year of the Republic (1941) and worked as a clerk in a candy store opened by口人 (Japanese) in Xuzhou and Hongkou, Shanghai. In August of the 32nd year of the Republic (1943), he entered the South Shanghai Prisoner of War Camp as a manager until the surrender. The criminal is short in stature and was wearing a Chinese-style white cotton short shirt and pants and black running shoes yesterday.</p>

<h3>Bloody Incident Occurs in Zhoujiadu South, Small Owner of Grocery Store Kills Elderly Neighbor in Moment of Anger, Father Injured While Trying to Intervene, Suspect Attempts Suicide Out of Fear of Punishment but Fails</h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at around 6:00 PM, Tang Yisan, the young owner of the Tang Longxing grocery store in Caojiazhai Ferry, Zhoujiadu South, four or so li away, became angry while worshiping gods in a nearby temple and threw the sacrificial offerings (pig, sheep, chicken meat) into the river. A neighbor, Hu Jijui, 72 years old, greedy for petty gains, was just retrieving the offerings to cook and eat them at home when Yisan found out. Yisan went home and grabbed two cleavers, chasing and hacking at Jijui wildly, with his head and arms falling off, and his chest and abdomen also being chopped up, bones broken and exposed, a gruesome death. His father, Tang Jinkuan, horrified to see his son killing someone with a knife, stepped forward to hug him and shouted, "Kill me first if you want to kill," resulting in him also being slashed six times. Fortunately, the injuries were not critical, and his life is not in danger. Yisan, seeing the situation escalate and unable to escape the law, jumped into the river, hoping to float across to escape. At that time, Section Chief Pan of the local police station had already arrived and ordered two policemen to fire several shots, and Tang Yisan began to come ashore and was arrested. However, he had also suffered severe knife wounds to his head and chest, presumably self-inflicted out of fear of punishment, and his condition was quite dangerous. He was later sent to Shanghai Renji Hospital for treatment and will be brought back for questioning after he recovers.</p>

<h3>News Outside the News - London</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent Xue Yan from London, 18th [of the month] Airmail</p>
<p>Government's Most Confusing Replies</p>
<p>In England, when people have matters to inquire about from ministers, ministers are expected to reply. If it is an inquiry from a member of parliament, it is even more necessary to reply. Once a reply has been given, they are subject to questioning. On March 15, many members of parliament raised questions about the slow replies from various departments. It is said that the Secretary of State for War replied the slowest, with an average of six weeks to reply to each letter. The Colonial Office took eight days, the Foreign Office eight days, the Treasury thirteen days, the Home Office twenty-one days, the Admiralty twenty-four days, the Department of Education twenty-one days, the Air Ministry thirty-two days, the Ministry of War Transport thirty-three days, and the Ministry of Health twenty-four days. On behalf of the government, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasury replied that the reasons for the slow replies, in addition to the need to consider the questions themselves sometimes, were mainly the lack of manpower and not enough typists. It is hoped that the situation will improve after full restoration. He also said: In addition to replying to letters from members of parliament, government departments also need to reply to letters from the people. It would not be fair to delay replies to ordinary people in order to reply to letters from members of parliament in advance, and it would certainly not be approved by the House of Commons. He said: The War Office needs to reply to 5,000 letters per month, the Air Ministry 4,000 letters per month, and the Ministry of Labor and the Ministry of Health 1,600 letters each per month, so the work of government replies is very heavy.</p>
<p>MP Salaries to Increase to One Thousand Pounds</p>
<p>During the war, prices in England rose threefold, and the worst affected were of course the salaried class. But among the salaried class, workers were better off, as their wage increases were roughly the same as the price increases. Lower-level civil servants were also okay, because the salary standards for lower-level civil servants were more flexible. The minimum salary for actual civil servants has now been raised, so the minimum living standards can still be maintained. Only senior civil servants are relatively the most bitter. Many entertainment expenses related to their positions cannot be saved, and have increased with the high prices. But their income has reached the peak of the statutory salary level and cannot be increased further. By last autumn, they really couldn't bear it anymore, and the members of parliament were the first to ask for a raise, and they discussed it in parliament, and as a result, it was sent to a committee for review (organized by the members of parliament themselves). Now the review has ended, and recently a report was submitted, considering the request reasonable, and the annual salary of members of parliament should be increased from six hundred pounds to one thousand pounds. This bill can become law after it is passed by the parliament in three readings. The salary of British members of parliament was 400 pounds per year in 1911. In 1937, it increased to 600 pounds. This year, it is expected to increase to 1,000 pounds, of which 500 pounds can be exempted from income tax.</p>
<p>Travel Agencies Shoot Promotional Films Britain is now planning to increase its revenue by 400 million US dollars (equivalent to 100 million pounds) per year from tourists traveling to England, starting in 1947. Currently, due to the lack of various materials and the difficulty of transportation, it is naturally difficult to have many tourists traveling to England. But by next spring, it seems that the pre-war state can be restored. The Travel Association of Great Britain is currently planning to shoot eight films to be shown around the world as information to promote the current situation in Britain and stimulate travel interest. At the same time, there is also a film called "The World Seen by the Boys" in preparation. The content is probably to select the best scenery in various autonomous regions, the United States, and other allied countries and all the places where British soldiers have set foot, and intersperse the lives of British soldiers to make a film. It is said that British travel revenue reached 30 million pounds per year before the war, which has long exceeded Switzerland and Italy. It is only second to Canada and France. Before the war, France's annual travel revenue was 80 million pounds, while Canada's was 60 million pounds.</p>
<p>Imported Agricultural Products and Raw Materials</p>
<p>The United States' exports this year are expected to be about 2.5 billion pounds. Of this, 300 million pounds is to be sold to the UK. What are the things that these 300 million pounds want to buy? According to the "Daily Mail," 106 million pounds will be spent on meat, tallow, and poultry. 31 million pounds will be spent on grains, vegetables, fruits, vegetable oils, and beer. 47 million pounds will be spent on synthetic rubber, medicines, seeds, and tobacco. 33 million pounds will be spent on engines, turbines, and various building, transportation, mining, electrical, and industrial machinery. 13 million pounds will be spent on cotton, cotton textiles, rayon, synthetic fibers, and various textiles. 11 million pounds will be spent on wood, cork, wood products, pulp, and paper. 26 million pounds will be spent on petroleum, petroleum by-products, and sulfur. 9 million pounds will be spent on medicines and chemicals, including soaps and cosmetics. The UK is a highly industrialized country, so the products it buys from foreign countries are mostly agricultural products and raw materials, which, after being reprocessed, are still transported and sold abroad.</p>
<p>The Two Princesses' Shadows Often Appear</p>
<p>The current British Emperor has no sons, only two princesses. The eldest princess, Elizabeth, will be the next Queen by rule. To deepen the impression of the British people, publicity has now begun. Ship launches, grand opening ceremonies, etc., are often invited to attend. And in newsreels and photo exhibitions, their shadows can be seen everywhere. The princess is now in her prime, with a graceful demeanor, and the British people look at her with respect and love. Currently, many of the UK's autonomous regions welcome royal visits. The trip to South Africa in February next year has been decided. Canada is also reportedly in discussions. Australia and New Zealand may follow suit, which is also uncertain.</p>
<p>Reasonable Treatment for the Poor</p>
<p>Since the Labour Party came to power, it has been making every effort to promote the nationalization of enterprises. Although the Conservative Party has been constantly attacking and opposing it, there is no doubt that the nationalization plan is popular with the common people. Minister of Health Bevan proposed a plan for the nationalization of medical care on March 22, which will mark a new era in medical history. According to Bevan's plan, from 1938, people in the UK who need medical treatment will not have to spend money. Any person's medical expenses will be borne by the state. The method is to divide the country into 26 districts, each with a health center. A committee will manage local health affairs. The composition of the committee is half representatives elected by doctors, pharmacists, etc., and the other half appointed by local governments and the Ministry of Health. All matters such as the hiring of hospitals and doctors, medical schools, and the management of medical expenses will be managed by it. All qualified doctors can practice medicine everywhere, and their salaries will be paid by the medical center. However, the standard for payment is half a fixed salary, and the other half is determined according to the number and frequency of people they treat. Patients can freely choose a doctor. As long as a doctor proves it, there is no need to pay for hospitalization. However, if doctors do not want to be employed, they can also practice medicine on their own, and patients can of course pay to find a doctor. Therefore, the role of this plan is entirely to guarantee medical care for the common people. Any poor person who gets sick can get reasonable treatment. After this system is implemented, it is believed that very few private doctors will set up their own practices. (April 10, London.)</p>
<h3>The Dual Character of the Soviet Union - Violence - Coordination</h3>
<p>— Countries Hold a Skeptical Attitude</p>
<p>Soviet policy seems to be a huge contradiction, but it is not. The Danes were overjoyed when the Red Army began to withdraw from Bornholm. When the Soviet Union stationed troops in Iran, the world suspected that it had the intention of inciting indigenous people to rebel and causing renewed riots in Iran, but the Soviet Union allowed it to withdraw from Iran within six weeks, "if nothing unexpected happens." The Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union recently ordered the demobilization of six grades of the Red Army in mid-September.</p>
<p>The day after this order was issued, Moscow Radio commentator Volonin issued a warning, saying that the Soviet Union "is surrounded by capitalist countries and reactionary forces, and their desire to redistribute the world may again cause armed conflict..." China recently happily announced that the Soviet Union had notified China that it would allow the withdrawal from the Northeast on May 1. According to the Canadian government, Soviet spy network members not only received rubles from Moscow, but even received instructions telling them not to take carriages directly to secret meeting places. All of this seems to be contradictory at first glance, but it is not.</p>
<p>Power, Prestige, Security</p>
<p>The Soviet Union's dual character of violence and coordination makes other countries feel puzzled because they always hold a skeptical attitude toward it.</p>
<p>The Soviet Union needs power; the Soviet Union needs prestige; the Soviet Union needs security. The Soviet Union believes that peace is the best opportunity, better than all the opportunities that Tsarist Russia had, and that the Bolsheviks might have in a decade or two.</p>
<p>Last week, Washington rumors said that American officials who stayed in Germany found a blueprint for Moscow's plans in the transcripts of Molotov's talks with Ribbentrop before Germany invaded the Soviet Union in 1941. Molotov demanded the Baltic states, all of Poland occupied by the Soviet Union, certain areas of Finland, eastern Romania, full control of the Tartar Strait, free disposition of Iran and Iraq, and a portion of Arabia in order to control the Persian Gulf. Ribbentrop thought the Soviet Union was asking for too much.</p>
<p>What is the Soviet Union's Goal?</p>
<p>But the Soviet Union itself believes that its territorial demands are legitimate. Communism believes that it is safest to have its problems treated by itself. In order to seek this security, the Soviet Union has annexed a total of 273,947 square miles of territory since 1939 - an area larger than the US state of Texas. It placed the countries on its borders behind "friendly" (i.e., docile) governments, and now only two exceptional countries, Iran and Turkey, are still under pressure from the sea. In the Soviet Union's view, even Iranian oil is not as important as a puppet regime in Tehran.</p>
<p>The Soviet Union is temporarily satisfied with influencing a small number of people in some other countries (such as France and Italy). Although this small number of people does not have the strong power to control the overall situation, they also have considerable influence to contain what the Soviet Union considers to be redundant policies. In addition, there is a third group of countries (such as India and Spain) that are suffering from communist intrusion, mostly because their current governments have not yet solved urgent political and social problems.</p>
<p>The Soviet Union observes capitalist and socialist countries with suspicious eyes, so the Soviet Union maintains the world's most powerful army (at least six million people). The Soviet Union would rather isolate its own sphere of influence from the rest of the world, and has cut off most of the economic and cultural ties between Eastern Europe and the West. But it is eager to establish closer ties with countries that can help it divide up other forces, and it is now courting the humanitarian Arabs and the fascist Argentinians. The Soviet Union specializes in exploiting the weaknesses of countries around the world.</p>
<p>Participate in International Organizations</p>
<p>The Soviet Union's economic power is expanding into the gaps left by the collapsed German and Japanese industries and trade. Its social system, although opposed to centuries of Western progress, is gaining the favor of hundreds of millions of people around the world. Its political tactics are confident, ruthless, and ever-changing, from military terror to humanitarianism. It uses countless methods, directly and indirectly, and countless groups to complete its mission.</p>
<p>The Soviet Union joins international organizations when it is profitable. For example, it opposed the World Aviation Agreement because it did not want foreign planes to fly over its territory. It did not join the Bretton Woods International Monetary Fund Agreement and the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization, but it actively participated in the World Federation of Trade Unions.</p>
<p>Principle of Equality of All Countries</p>
<p>But no matter what fears and ambitions the Soviet Union has, it does not need war. Although it has a desire to seize, it is very sensitive to strong and united opposition. The Soviet Union is still weaker than the United States and much weaker than the entire Western world. If the other countries of the world abide by the United Nations Charter, the Soviet Union's desires will not deviate from the norm.</p>
<p>Last week, Stalin suddenly praised the United Nations organization, which the Soviet Union had always opposed: that is, the United Nations organization's emphasis on the principle of equality of all countries and its rejection of the principle of one country dominating other countries. Stalin said that the great future of the United Nations organization depends on the principle of equality. Small nations can again answer with France's irony: "The law is impartial; it prohibits both the poor and the rich from sleeping under bridges, begging on the streets, and stealing bread." But if the Soviet Union cannot fulfill Stalin's promise, then they can also find other words to blame the Soviet Union.

<p>Analysis of the European Political Situation - Drawn by the Newspaper's Reference Room - Due to the chaos during and after the war, the political situation in most European countries is still unstable.</p>
<h3>Severe Spring Famine: No Green Grass in the Fields, Wailing and Starving People in Northern Anhui</h3>
<p>— Our Newspaper, 20th Dispatch, Bengbu Correspondent Qian Mengchao</p>
<p>The twenty-three counties in northern Anhui after the catastrophe are like a breached dike, the ruins overgrown with weeds, desolate and lonely. The mountains and rivers of Shou, Huai, Xiu, and Qian cannot conceal the traces of war. The loyal bones along the banks of the Huai River and the desolate tombs on both sides of the Jinpu Railway have written an indelible epic. The counties, once known for producing rice and wheat, are now not only almost emptied of inhabitants in nine out of ten households, but also filled with wailing and starving people, creating a scene too unbearable to witness. During this season when the provinces and cities in the recovered areas are universally suffering from crop failures, the severity of the spring famine in northern Anhui is truly no less than that of Hunan and Guangxi provinces. The situation of the spring famine is described as follows:</p>
<p>Disasters Occur Frequently, Famine Rages Everywhere</p>
<p>The Japanese invaders occupied northern Anhui for seven years and eight months, from the autumn they entrenched themselves until their surrender last autumn. Only Fuyang City managed to remain secure and not be captured. However, the enemy cavalry had already entered the county's territory, only thirty li away from the city. Most of northern Anhui suffered bloody rule during the occupation period. In addition to the enemy and puppet regimes' arbitrary exploitation, there were continuous droughts, locust plagues, and floods. Last year, the Yellow River diverted into the Huai River, causing torrential backflow. The low-lying areas of Fengyang and Wuhe became vast expanses of water, almost turning into swamps. Not only was there no autumn harvest, but many places were unable to sow the winter wheat that should have been planted in August and September last year. There is little doubt that the summer harvest of wheat will be poor this year. Currently, in remote areas, the rural areas are almost completely bankrupt. In Xuyi County, areas like Bangze are as empty as suspended chimes, with no green grass in the fields. If the grain-producing areas near the lake are like this, one can imagine the situation in other barren mountainous areas. Therefore, famine occurs everywhere. There are many places where disaster victims eat tree bark and grass roots to eke out a living.</p>
<p>Forced Purchase of Military Grain: People of Anhui Heartbroken</p>
<p>The War of Resistance was victorious, and the central government was well aware that the people had suffered greatly. Therefore, it specifically ordered the exemption of land taxes for one year in the occupied areas and implemented a 25% rent reduction to benefit poor farmers. The people of northern Anhui were overjoyed by this decree, feeling like they were "full of food and beating their bellies." Unexpectedly, after four or five months, a disguised "forced purchase of military grain" appeared. It was stated that payment would be given, but in some remote counties, it was barely enough to cover the cost of transporting the grain. This is truly a comical tragedy. The grain purchase in Anhui Province is handled strangely. The Ministry of Food gives an agreed-upon price, reportedly 5,500 yuan per shi, but Anhui Province only gives 4,500 yuan. This is then distributed from the provincial government to the counties, and then to the people. After passing through seven or eight levels of county, township, and village chiefs, and the extraction and exploitation of the "tooth-like" middlemen, no one knows how much the people actually receive. The corruption of grain officials is what the people of Anhui resent most. The recent attacks on a certain high official are also one of the reasons. Fortunately, the central government has decided to reorganize the Anhui provincial government, and the people of northern Anhui may have hope for recovery. However, all counties are currently experiencing grain shortages. If prompt and unified relief is not organized and implemented, it will be unimaginable when the season of food scarcity arrives. Therefore, the reporter earnestly hopes that the authorities will immediately find a proper relief method to alleviate the suffering of the compatriots in northern Anhui.</p>
<p>Communist Army Occupies Xuyi, Suffering is Most Severe</p>
<p>Good fortune never comes in pairs, and misfortune never comes alone. The people of northern Anhui, living in extreme hardship, are unfortunately also burdened by the Communist army occupying Xuyi, Wuhe, Sixian, Lingbi, Fengyang, Suxian, Dingyuan, and areas in northern Jiangsu, demanding food on the spot, which further increases the consumption of grain. In addition to levies and quotas, they also forcibly coerce people to cut down telegraph poles, dig up railways, and carry out sabotage work. They even force them to go to the front lines, charge into battle, and become victims under fire.</p>
<p>Taking just Xuyi County as an example, the severity of the disaster is unprecedented in centuries. People are on the brink of starvation, like ants on a hot pot, driven to a dead end. The number of people fleeing to other places has reached more than 30,000. The Xuyi Fellow Villagers Association in Mingguang recently stated that tens of thousands of refugees urgently need relief. In addition to requesting relief from relevant agencies and charitable organizations, they also appealed to people from all walks of life to show sympathy and provide relief. The appeal states: "Before the War of Resistance had even reached the halfway point, the entire territory of Xuyi became a den of bandits, occupied by the Communist army. The county seat was once occupied by the enemy, and the rural areas were still occupied by the Communist army. For eight years, the people have not only had their fields and produce plundered by the Communist army, but countless lives have also been slaughtered. After the victory, after the Japanese invaders withdrew, the red flames spread throughout the county, with robbery and killing heard every day. Conscription of soldiers, demolition of houses to fill the fields, there is no time to rest. Currently, all the able-bodied men in the county, except those conscripted by someone, have all fled. Landlords, gentry, and intellectuals, except those who have been killed, have left one after another, empty-handed, taking refuge in other places. There is no housing, no food or clothing, sleeping in the open and eating in the wind, crying from hunger and cold. Excluding Nanjing, Shanghai, Zhenjiang, Yangzhou, Lin'an, Bengbu, and other ports, just in Mingguang, a district of Jiashan County, there are no fewer than 1,000 households and more than 5,000 Xuyi refugees. Although half of these people are landlords and gentry, their livelihoods have almost been completely cut off after being exploited and trampled upon by the Communist army for eight years. If they are not quickly given relief, they will all be buried in ditches." The words are filled with sorrow. Is it blood? Is it tears? One cannot bear to finish reading.</p>
<p>Driven by Hunger, a Tragedy Unfolds</p>
<p>Bengbu is located in the middle reaches of the Huai River, at the intersection of the Jinpu Railway, connecting the north and south, and is an important town in northern Anhui. After this great war, although the outer shell remains, the spirit is gone. Bengbu was occupied for more than seven years, and the people were almost completely exploited, resulting in severe damage to their vitality. Before the war, Bengbu was a gathering place for salt and grain and a distribution center for goods in northern Anhui. Although the market is now crowded and bustling, and the surface of commerce appears to be gradually prospering, it is actually strong on the outside but weak on the inside. As a result of arbitrary quotas, the people are filled with complaints, and various arbitrary taxes continue to emerge endlessly. Recently, prices have soared, and people's purchasing power has weakened, causing all industries to show a bleak scene.</p>
<p>Recently, a tragic event occurred here, a heart-wrenching tragedy caused by hunger. It is reported that in Jingyi Road, Weiyi Lane, a refugee from Henan Province named Wang, a family of three, came to Bengbu last winter to make a living. Recently, due to rising prices and difficult living conditions, they were unable to borrow money. On the 28th of last month, the man strangled his own young son with a rope, and then the couple hanged themselves together. Afterwards, someone discovered the incident, and charitable organizations provided coffins for a hasty burial. The hardship of disaster victims seeking a living in the city can be seen from this.</p>
<h3>The Winds and Rains of Nanchang</h3>
<p>The people of Nanchang often call the tall and solemn provincial government building here the "Nanchang White House." The willow trees inside and outside the White House are changing day by day, thriving and flourishing. The owner of the White House is also undergoing a transition from old to new, giving people a sentimental farewell to the old and deeply entrusting hopes to the new.</p>
<p>Cao Haosen has been in charge of Jiangxi for more than four years, and many people call him "Grandma Cao." Cao's departure during this period of urgent need for recuperation will surely leave people with fond memories.</p>
<p>Peach Blossoms Vie for Beauty in San Village, Bridge Water Carries Sorrow in Gaoqiao</p>
<p>San Village is only about five li away from the city. The peach blossoms in the village have always been famous for their beauty and are currently in full bloom. The authorities have already dispatched workers to repair the roads to facilitate tourists. Although the weather has not been good recently, many refined scholars are flocking to enjoy the scenery. They bring some snacks with them when they go and return with a few branches of peach blossoms. It is a great opportunity to linger and enjoy the scenery. However, this kind of scenery is only available to a few refined scholars.</p>
<p>Near Gaoqiao, there are many thatched huts. The area is low-lying and has many ditches. Recently, the rain gods have been rampant, and the surroundings of the thatched huts are filled with water, forming canals. As a result, the "refugees" inside have to drag through the mud when they go out, and they are suffocated by moldy air when they enter. Someone said with a bitter smile: "Ask the refugees of Gaoqiao how much sorrow they have? It's just like the turbid water flowing under the bridge."</p>
<p>Epidemics Rampant, Wind Disaster Also Terrifying</p>
<p>Meningitis and typhoid fever are the two major epidemics in this city. In particular, the spread of meningitis has now entered a rampant stage. The main reason for this is that garbage is everywhere, and the number of public toilets is small and extremely dirty. In addition, there is a shortage of housing and high rents, and the population is dense, resulting in poor air quality and the breeding of bacteria. Many people have died from meningitis, especially children. This cannot be said to be a serious problem.</p>
<p>But "misfortune never comes singly." A hurricane and thunderstorm on the sixth of this month caused significant damage. The newly built school building of the Provincial No. 2 Middle School completely collapsed, crushing one school worker to death and injuring eleven students.</p>
<p>But hurricanes are "natural disasters," and whether they will come again, people can only leave it to fate. Meningitis and other epidemics are not "natural disasters." Relevant parties really cannot let people resign themselves to fate.</p>
<p>Relief for the Unemployed: Jiangxi Office Faces Difficulties</p>
<p>The Jiangxi Branch of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) has been established for nearly five months. "The tower near the water gets the moonlight first." The poor people of this city have indeed enjoyed many benefits early on. For example, distributing 956 bags of flour and accommodating 240 elderly, young, disabled people are notable examples. But these are passive relief efforts. Active relief efforts are now underway: one is to provide small loans to small and medium-sized merchants, divided into two categories: Category A is 100,000 yuan, and Category B is 50,000 yuan. The other is to provide relief for the unemployed, accommodate unemployed poor people, provide them with professional training, and introduce them to employment. The former is less difficult, but the latter is very difficult because there are currently too many unemployed poor people in this city: a total of 14,579 people (including 7,336 men and 7,243 women). - This is undoubtedly a major difficulty for the Jiangxi Branch. How to quickly break through it will depend on the entire staff of the office brainstorming and working together to find solutions.</p>

<h3>Ministry of Education Preliminary Revision: Elementary School Curriculum Standards, Grades One and Two Language and General Knowledge Combined Teaching, Arithmetic Not Listed as a Core Subject in Grade One, Eliminating Complex Teaching Materials, Concise and Essential Compilation</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Chongqing Special Dispatch] The Ministry of Education has held multiple meetings to discuss the revision of the elementary school curriculum. A preliminary draft has been agreed upon with several key points. After it is organized and completed, it will be brought back to the capital, and experts will be gathered again for a final decision. It is heard that the purpose of revising the elementary school curriculum is to eliminate complex and overly difficult teaching materials, creating a concise and essential compilation to suit the level and psychology of children, making it easier to understand, and achieving practical results. In addition, the Chinese language and general knowledge in grades one and two will be combined into a textbook for integrated teaching. General knowledge materials will be used in Chinese language classes to explain the words, and the content of general knowledge materials will also be explored in depth in general knowledge classes. For example, in the Chinese language class, the topic is "Frogs are Beneficial Insects," while in the general knowledge class, "Beneficial Insects" will be expanded and elaborated upon. General knowledge will only be established as a separate textbook from grade three onwards. Furthermore, considering that first graders are young, it is often difficult for them to understand if arithmetic is taught mechanically. Most people advocate that arithmetic should not be listed as a core subject in the first grade, and teaching should be done opportunistically during games. (An)</p>
<h3>Jiaotong University's Tangshan and Peiping Campuses: Ministry of Education Still Permits Separate Establishment</h3>
<p>[Dahua News Agency, Guiyang Dispatch] The Tangshan and Peiping campuses of Jiaotong University were merged by the Ministry of Education in the summer of 1942 and renamed Jiaotong University's Guizhou Branch. Now, the Ministry of Education, recognizing that the two campuses have their own unique history and achievements, has approved them to be established separately again and moved back to their original sites in Tangshan and Peiping. Gu Yisun will continue to serve as the President of Tangshan Institute of Technology, while Xu Peikun will be appointed as the President of the Peiping campus. The various files of the two campuses in Guizhou are being sorted out separately.</p>
<h3>Chongqing Baisha Women's Normal College Scheduled to Resume Classes Tomorrow</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Chongqing Dispatch] After consultation between Wu Chu, the Director of the Administrative Reorganization Committee of Baisha National Women's Normal College, and Xie Xunchu, the President of the College, student registration has been completed in both Chongqing and Baisha on the 15th of this month. More than 500 people have registered. The new school buildings are currently being repaired to allow all registered students to report and register at Jiulongpo on the 29th.

<h3>128 Credit Hours for Four Years: Ministry of Education Reduces Burden on University Students</h3>
<p>[Dahua News Agency, Nanjing Dispatch] According to Zhu Jingnong, the Vice Minister of Education, before leaving Chongqing, he convened a meeting of education experts to discuss the issue of university courses. It was generally believed that the common required courses and specialized required courses in Chinese universities placed too heavy a burden on students and should be improved by reducing the number of required courses and increasing the number of elective courses. After discussion, it was believed that common required courses such as history and philosophy should continue to be studied, while specialized required courses should be reduced as much as possible. At the same time, the number of credit hours in the four years of university, originally 136 (excluding physical education credit hours), has now been decided to be reduced to 128.</p>
<h3>Municipal Education Bureau Orders Private Schools to Report Actual Revenue</h3>
<p>[This City Dispatch] The Municipal Education Bureau has always been deeply concerned about the difficult living conditions of teachers in private schools. Recently, as the living problem has become increasingly severe, faculty members have either presented their cases in person to seek assistance or have collectively requested relief. The bureau has done everything within its power to assist them. Fearing that the schools may have improper financial expenditures, the bureau has specifically issued a circular to all schools: (1) The exact amount of the second installment of tuition and miscellaneous fees collected by each school, or the amount of student funding, and the amount distributed to each teacher should be reported truthfully. (2) The current salary situation of teachers in each school, such as the highest monthly salary and the lowest monthly salary, should also be reported in detail truthfully. The above-mentioned items must be reported promptly within five days of receiving the document, and all schools are expected to comply.</p>
<h3>Twelve More Public Schools Opened</h3>
<p>[Dahua News Agency Dispatch] Since the promotion of public education in this city, no effort has been spared. The first batch of sixteen schools was opened last year, and the second batch of seventeen schools was opened in March of this year. The aim is to accelerate the elimination of illiteracy and actively promote remedial education for the out-of-school public. Recently, the third batch of twelve schools has been opened. The names of the directors of each school are published as follows: Municipal (34) School, Hou Haigen; (35) Wang Zhihong; (36) Xu Baochun; (37) Yu Shufang; (38) Huang Boyi; (39) Sun Binfei; (40) Ren Linbao; (41) Lin Huayuan; (42) Zhang Zhenhua; (43) Yang Di; (44) Yuchi Ying; (45) Jiang Jingyi; (46) Chen Xinying.</p>
<h3>Southwest Associated University to Start Summer Vacation Tomorrow, Majority of Faculty and Students to Take Route Through Changsha to the North</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Kunming Special Dispatch] Southwest Associated University, eager to relocate, is actively carrying out relocation matters. It is heard that due to the relocation, the school has decided to start summer vacation early on May 1st, with the vacation period set for three months. During this period, the relocation matters can be handled in an orderly manner. Faculty and students who wish to leave the school first should register with the school. Then, the Kunming Temporary Office of the Executive Yuan and the Highway Administration will send them to Changsha or Wuzhou via the method of sending back righteous people, from where they will transfer to the north. This registration has now closed, with a total of 760 people registered, most of whom wish to go to Changsha. The first batch will begin to be sent in early May. The school has stipulated that the travel expenses will be 150,000 yuan per student, and the loan funds for April, May, and June will be issued in advance. For faculty members, those who are still teaching at the school before the end of April will have their salaries paid up to August. All staff of Peking University, Tsinghua University, and Nankai University will return to Peiping and Tianjin respectively to continue their service. Those who remain in Kunming to handle the relocation work are not subject to this rule. As for how to issue severance pay to staff who the school does not wish to retain, the Ministry of Education is being consulted.</p>

<h3>Special Broadcast in San Francisco Celebrating Tsinghua Anniversary</h3>
<p>[San Francisco Dispatch from the U.S. Information Service, 29th] A special broadcast program was held here today to celebrate the 35th anniversary of the founding of Tsinghua University. Mr. Orr, a former diplomatic official stationed in Peiping by the U.S. State Department, and Mr. Chen, Counselor of the Chinese Embassy, both gave speeches.</p>
<p>China's Revival Requires Talent</p>
<p>Mr. Orr, formerly a member of the Tsinghua Board of Trustees, referred to Tsinghua as a "model of international cooperation" in his speech. Mr. Orr's speech stated in brief: "The management of Tsinghua has, of course, always been in the hands of your country's authorities, but the United States government has never ceased to pay attention to Tsinghua during these 35 years. In 1908, the U.S. Congress remitted the indemnity to China, which happily helped establish Tsinghua. The Chinese and American authorities who agreed to establish Tsinghua did not know that their cooperative action was a precursor to international cooperation. During that period, when American schools discussed Tsinghua and the education of Chinese youth, they emphasized the need to train a large number of technical personnel. Currently, as in the past, the revival of China requires many, many people of this kind. It is generally believed that the return of the indemnity will enable China to obtain more experts more quickly. Most importantly, you graduates have increased China's strength, and, in the work of transforming the world based on international peace and justice, you have also fulfilled a very important responsibility in helping China become one of the leaders. Therefore, it is clear that Sino-American cooperation, using the indemnity for education, not only benefits China but also benefits the United States and the entire world. International reciprocal cooperation will produce valuable results, and Tsinghua proved the truth of this principle long ago. Even in the current world, the adoption of this principle has resulted in the United Nations, the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, the Food and Agriculture Organization, and the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, etc. Your American friends firmly believe that on this memorable day, moving forward along new paths of international cooperation, you will surely be able to serve the Republic of China and the world with the same spirit."</p>
<p>The Earliest Effort in Sino-American Cooperation</p>
<p>Counselor Chen's speech stated in brief: "At one time, international relations were limited to affairs between governments. In the past few decades, this concept has been constantly changing. Now we pay more attention to the work of cultural exchange. We believe that the foundation of international relations should be built on mutual understanding between nations. We believe that this understanding is indeed a great force for maintaining international peace. The U.S. State Department and the U.S. Congress have formulated detailed plans for cultural cooperation with the aim of world peace. When this plan was discussed in the United States, the contribution of Tsinghua was often noted; Tsinghua was the earliest effort in this regard. Currently, there is a mutual understanding between the peoples of China and the United States, promoting active cooperation between the two countries in wartime and peacetime. This mutual understanding is also one of Tsinghua's contributions. Therefore, this year's Tsinghua anniversary is of utmost importance. In a private capacity, I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate the students and also hope that Tsinghua, after this unfortunate interlude, can redouble its efforts to create Sino-American contact and make a greater contribution to promoting international understanding, because in any case, international understanding is the foundation of world peace."</p>

<h3>Mayor's Cup Basketball Quarterfinals: Lianghua vs. Giants Tonight; Another Group: Xinhao vs. Enkas; Women's Quarterfinals: Green Team vs. Qinglian</h3>
<p>The Mayor's Cup basketball tournament for men and women has entered the quarterfinal stage today, with a total of three games taking place at the Municipal Gymnasium from 6 PM. Tickets are priced at 1,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Women's Quarterfinals</p>
<p>The women's group will take the stage first, with the Green Team facing Qinglian. The latter demonstrated their bravery and combat skills during the preliminary round, defeating Xue Xue. However, they are likely to face an uphill battle against the Green Team, which is the league champion of the first division. Their players are all top-notch, with not only superb skills but also seamless cooperation. It is expected that they will eliminate Qinglian and win the right to the finals.</p>
<p>Men's Quarterfinals</p>
<p>Following the women's group, the men's group will compete, with the U.S. Air Force 3198 Signal Team facing the West Qing Enkas. The Signal Team demonstrated their full combat capabilities against Dahua the other day. Although their defense is relatively poor, their strength is quite abundant. Enkas has sophisticated technology and unwavering fighting spirit, and there is sure to be a great battle with the Signal Team.</p>
<p>In the last game, Lianghua will face the Giants. Lianghua is making a comeback this time, and old members such as Tang Baokun, Liu Zhenyuan, and Shen Yugong have returned. With the assistance of Wu Bixian, Zhuo Guorong, Liu Fushan, and Guo Jie, their lineup is strong and unmatched. Although they only made a small test against Zhenyuan in the preliminary match, they fully revealed their northern style. Zhenyuan and Baokun are as fierce as ever. Unfortunately, Li Zhen was injured and could not play, which is a slight flaw. The Giants have veterans Carson and Kailomitov, Taobolinji, and Funik, among other famous players, and their military appearance is prosperous and should not be underestimated. It is expected that a meeting between these Chinese and Western heroes will surely have a wonderful and enthusiastic performance. Today's schedule is as follows:</p>

<h3>Golden Lion Basketball Team Returns to Shanghai; One Last Loss to Liangxi</h3>
<p>The Golden Lion Basketball Team from this city traveled to Liangxi last Friday (April 26th) and played three games in Xixi, winning two and losing one. They returned to Shanghai by express train last night. The expeditionary team defeated the White Team the other day in Xixi. The team visited the scenic Huishan on the morning of the day before, and in the afternoon competed with Gengyu Team, a strong local team from Xixi. Zhang Wenyuan served as the referee. The Golden Lions were even more rampant with the assistance of Shi Jiuquan. At the end of the first half, the result was 31 to 13, with the expeditionary team leading. Afterwards, the two teams played again. The Golden Lions' fresh troops continued to take the stage. Li Youxiang and Wu Zonglin of the Gengyu team were extremely active, but Huang Cunrui, Wang Rongsheng, and Wang Bingfu of the Golden Lions scored repeatedly, so Gengyu was ultimately difficult to surpass. As a result, the expeditionary team defeated Gengyu 65 to 41, winning their second victory. Yesterday, the visiting team toured the scenic spot Yuantouzhu. At 5 PM in the afternoon, they fought the Liangxi team at the original location. Fans flocked to watch, and the situation was unprecedentedly enthusiastic. The Golden Lions were inevitably tired from fighting for many days, and Liangxi was able to participate in Zhuo Guorong, making the lineup even more substantial. The referee was Xuan Hegao. The Golden Lion generals gave their lives for a while, and the first half ended with a narrow victory of 12 to 10. After a break, the battle resumed. Liangxi was ultimately a local strongman, and they quickly took the lead with 19 to 13. Not long after, Gao Baosheng of Liangxi and Huang Cunrui of the Golden Lions were both disqualified for committing four fouls. The Golden Lions had no leader and could not reverse the decline, and finally lost for the first time with a score of 15 to 24.</p>

<h3>The Cadre Melting Pot of the New Taiwan: A Sketch of the National Maritime Frontier School</h3>
<p>— Lin Ying</p>
<p>Since the Cairo Conference decided that after the war, the Northeast, Taiwan, and other places would be re-assigned to China, the Central Government, in order to prepare for the future takeover of Taiwan and to actively cultivate maritime frontier specialists, hastily established this "National Maritime Frontier School."</p>
<p>The emergence of the Maritime School was, in the eyes of most people at the time, a "mystery." This was because the war within the country was entering its most serious stage, and the southeastern provinces were almost completely isolated. The idea of victory could be said to have faded from the minds of the people. Who would have thought that we would regain the beautiful Taiwan in the near future! Fortunately, this gentle measure by the Central Government somewhat restored the confidence of the people in the Southeast at that time, making people feel that the government was thinking about victory in every way. The Maritime School became a symbol of victory for the people of the Southeast at that time!</p>
<p>The first person to be ordered to come to Fujian to prepare for this school was Mr. Zhang Zhaohuan from Xianyou. He arrived in Fujian in June of the 33rd year [of the Republic] [1944]. In just a few months, with the enthusiastic support of the people in the Putian and Xianyou area, he determined the temporary school site in his hometown of Xianyou. The dormitories and classrooms were set up in the original headquarters of the division management area, and enrollment began immediately. At that time, the quota was 200 students. High school graduates or those with equivalent qualifications could apply. The only restriction was that people from southern Fujian had to account for 70 percent of the students, because the language of southern Fujian is the same system as that of Taiwan, and they can communicate freely. According to the original plan, the scale of the Maritime School was quite large. The entire school had four departments, organized as follows:</p>
<p>1. Administrative Department: Set up civil affairs, finance, education, construction, and other groups, with the aim of cultivating county government personnel.</p>
<p>2. Normal Department: Set up literature, history, civics, mathematics, and other groups, with the aim of training primary and secondary school teachers.</p>
<p>3. Technical Department: Set up aquaculture, sugar manufacturing, tea making, iron smelting, and other groups, with the aim of training specialized technicians.</p>
<p>4. Special Department: Specifically handles various training classes set up due to special needs.</p>
<p>In the first semester, only 50 students each were enrolled in the finance and education groups of the Administrative Department, and 100 students were enrolled in the Literature and History group of the Normal Department. After the victory of the War of Resistance, due to the need to change goals, the school also made appropriate reductions and adjustments. Therefore, the Administrative Department was changed to the Department of Law and Commerce, and the service locations were expanded from Taiwan to the coastal areas and Southeast Asia. The Normal Department added a "five-year normal course" under the two-year system, enrolling graduates from junior high schools and above. Other departments will be planned according to the situation.</p>
<p>Mr. Zhang, the original principal, was once transferred to serve as the principal of the National Conservatory of Music. Mr. Liang Longguang, a member of the Fujian Provincial Senate, succeeded as the head of the Maritime School. Mr. Liang is from southern Fujian and has been engaged in party affairs education in various parts of Southeast Asia for decades. Therefore, after taking over, he immediately moved the school site from central Fujian to Jiudu, which belongs to Nanan County in southern Fujian. This place is close to Yongchun, Xianyou, and other places, and transportation can still be considered convenient. Because it is temporary in nature, the equipment is still simple.</p>
<p>Currently, there are more than 390 students in the entire school (including 100 five-year normal school students). They all live together on weekdays. There is no such freedom as in ordinary universities here. "Withdrawal" and "demerit" of students can be found from time to time. Students' "treatment" is entirely provided by the school. In addition to the national university public expense standard of 34 and a half catties of rice and 1,750 yuan for non-staple food per month, there are also some pocket money. There is a set of uniforms every school year, and students in the normal school are even more privileged, and they don't have to bother their parents to pay out of their pockets. Even students with larger expenses will not "run out of money at the bedside." Therefore, the lives of Maritime School students can be said to be stable.</p>
<p>There are not many extracurricular activities for students. Compared with ordinary schools, there is a special feature here, that is, the first language that must be used is Southern Fujianese - that is, Taiwanese, followed by Mandarin (but in Fujian, every student can speak it), and the third is English. In terms of courses, in addition to the compulsory courses in ordinary middle and high schools, several courses in administrative management, teaching outline, etc. have been added.</p>
<p>According to regulations, students' future is to be sent to work in Taiwan by the government, but perhaps the possibility of Southeast Asia is greater in the future, because Taiwan has returned to the motherland: after that, there will be various talents who will go there, but the 6 million overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia have always been in a state of helplessness. Maritime School students should at least shoulder the mission of education and guidance in this regard.</p>
<p>Restoration issue: Regarding the school site, it was once proposed to move it to Taiwan at the time of victory, but later, for actual needs, the discussion was terminated midway. According to the decision of the school affairs meeting, it will be moved to Heshan, Xiamen. That place is surrounded by mountains and close to the sea, and it is much more convenient in terms of scenery, transportation, and experimentation. As for the issue of the school system, Principal Liang once had two plans: (1) Ask the Ministry of Education to add a research department under the school (divided into three groups: history and geography, immigration, and law and commerce, with a study period of two years, to serve two-year academic students after the service period expires to continue their studies). (2) Change to a college (or a joint college of law and commerce normal school). So that students have more opportunities to engage in deeper learning. Mr. Liang has already taken advantage of this opportunity to attend the Senate meeting to go to Chongqing to negotiate with the Ministry, and it is expected that a decision will be made after he returns.</p>
<p>Our country's coastline is long, but the border defense for hundreds of years has been so lax. The establishment of the Maritime School is a meaning that alarms people. The future of the Maritime School should not be ignored!</p>

<h3>Long-Stable Gold Prices Suddenly Soar Yesterday; Peak Transaction at 1.93 Million; Allotment Price Opens at 1.68</h3>
<p>Yellow dross soared to prominence yesterday, and in the stillness, there was a stirring; people's minds tended to cling to power. News of the rise in South African gold prices and the ban on silver firms and money changers trading foreign currency cash without the approval of the Central Bank of China (CBC) from next month, led shortsighted and sensitive observers to believe that the demand for foreign currency would become more difficult. At the same time, there were speculative concerns about the CBC's various policies starting May 1st. Once a frenzy was set off, buyers poured in one after another. Although the CBC tried its best to suppress it, it was too hasty, and the CBC allotted 866 bars of gold to the gold industry at 1.68 million. It was impossible to deliver that day and needed to be smelted into common bars, which would not be available until around 5 o'clock at the earliest. Once all these news were spread, various speculative funds felt that there was an opportunity to be seized, causing the CBC to secretly sell off through allied firms in addition to formally allotting gold to the industry. The rising wind was still difficult to contain and repeatedly rose and fell. The market once broke through 1.9 million twice, reaching a peak of 1.93 million. It was found that the morning opening stood above 1.6 million. After the opening, initially stimulated by the rise in U.S. dollars, buyers were already moving. When it broke through the 1.7 mark, most people no longer cared about the CBC's allotment price of 1.6 million. Around 1.78 million, the CBC sold some, and many parties also released gold, once falling to around 1.68 million. After several consultations, the CBC began to allot gold at this price, but the rush to exchange stocks for gold and the buying frenzy spread widely. In an instant, the rising trend started again. At noon, it struggled around 1.8 million. In the afternoon, because the CBC had no gold to deliver that day, buyers were unafraid. The CBC successively released no less than a thousand bars, but it still repeatedly crossed the 1.9 mark before turning the market. As a result, it soared by 280,000 compared to last Saturday. Gold jewelry rose by 198,000, silver remained flat, and silver dollars rose slightly. Due to the sudden increase in speculative sales, the unofficial exchange rate rose from 13% to about 20%. The CBC has yet to pay for most of the allotted gold. It is unknown whether the gold bulls will have momentum today.</p>
<h3>Public Bonds Decline</h3>
<p>The public bond environment has shifted. It is reported that the Ministry of Finance's bond lottery redemption has been moved to Shanghai. Many parties saw the opportunity and took profits, losing support and falling sharply. From a morning opening of 7,600 yuan, the Unified Bonds gradually declined, once breaking through the 6,000 mark and reaching a low price of 5,800 yuan. At noon, it hovered around 6,100 yuan, resulting in a drop of 1,300 compared to last Saturday. Other bonds also followed suit and fell by 1,400.</p>
<h3>Cotton Merchants Raise Prices; Limited Spot Cotton Transactions</h3>
<p>Yesterday, New York American cotton telegraphic prices rose by 9 to 12 points, with the near-term price at US$27.89, the far-term price at US$27.95, and the Middling spot price at US$28.52. The local spot cotton market was affected by the soaring gold and yarn prices, and cotton merchants quoted surprisingly high prices, making negotiations difficult to approach. As a result, transactions were underdeveloped. Shenxin No. 1 Factory still made purchases. Transactions between cotton firms were still lively. The delivered price of Middling spot cotton to the factory approached 100,000 yuan, a price 23,000 yuan higher than last Saturday.</p>
<h3>New Flag Tea Weakens and Falls</h3>
<p>The flag tea produced in Meijiawu, Hangzhou, is of good "color," "fragrance," and "taste," and is superior to the products of other production areas. This year's new goods have been on the market for a long time, but due to the decline in the situation in this city, they have also gradually weakened. Recently, the inter-firm price has fallen to 3.5 million yuan per dan. As for Ping Shui, Wenzhou, and other Longjing teas, more and more sources have arrived in recent days, and sellers are eager to sell, resulting in a market that has plummeted. Suzhou gangs are secretly absorbing a fair amount of aged tea. Furthermore, scattered stores in Tianjin and other places and this street are involved, so the overall situation can still be supported.</p>
<h3>Various Yarns Soar; 10-Count Coarse Yarn Particularly Popular</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the yarn market soared. Initially, news of the soaring gold and U.S. dollar prices spread, and yarn was not to be outdone, with all counts soaring. At the same time, actual sales were also extremely strong, and various gangs successively absorbed yarn, resulting in a general increase of more than 10%. 10-count coarse yarn was particularly popular. It is reported that demand exceeds supply in the Shanghai market, and people are unusually excited. Therefore, when the Fangjian Company opened yarn at noon, the place was crowded with people. Colleagues were scrambling to purchase, but because there was too little porridge and too many monks, the number allocated to each factory was extremely limited. The price opened was 50,000 to 270,000 higher than the previous period, with the 42-count thread having the largest increase. In addition, there were ten types of yarn offered for tender, and it is reported that Chenxingchang, Zhendachang, Zhengde, Tong茂chang and other firms and Yongda Dyeing and Weaving Factory successfully bid for seven types. There were also four counts and five counts of coarse yarn for which no one bid.</p>
<h3>Affected by Gold Prices, Silk Prices Rise Across the Board</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the silk market was stimulated by gold prices, and prices rose across the board, permeating the market. 120-count Tianqiao rayon opened at 1.72 million yuan and closed at 1.8 million yuan, with the smallest transaction price of 1.7 million yuan in the middle. The afternoon was even better, reaching a high of 1.85 million yuan. Other goods all rose by 100,000 to 200,000 yuan. Factory-managed foreign firm goods did not open for trading. The Robin Hood transaction price was 2.1 million yuan, and other grades were all 100,000 to 200,000 yuan higher. The price of silk fabrics was quite stable at the opening. Dacheng checkered crepe opened at 4,050 yuan and rose to 250 yuan with transactions. Later, it was heard that raw material prices had soared, so it was also raised to 400 yuan. In the afternoon, people were even more optimistic, shouting up to 4,550 yuan. The Meiya bedding business had transactions at 1.23 million yuan in the morning, and closed at 1.3 million yuan in the morning, and then rose by 60,000 yuan in the afternoon.</p>
<h3>Caustic Soda Shortages and Prices Rise</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the caustic soda market was very chaotic. The reasons are nothing more than the following: Gold and U.S. dollars rose sharply, American orders arriving in Shanghai were very few, and exports from Manila and other places were not allowed. The actual sales of factories in this city increased daily, and inventories were drying up. The market was bullish, so various firms rushed to purchase, and the price soared from 300,000 to 350,000, but no one was willing to sell. Only yellow petroleum jelly and bleaching powder had arrived, and the prices fell slightly.</p>
<h3>New-Style Tires Appear; U.S. Exports Increase</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Detroit, 29th] Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Company announced: This company has recently manufactured a new type of tire with a specially designed tread for trucks. It is expected to be mass-produced in mid-June.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 29th] The Civilian Production Administration announced: The number of tire exports in the second quarter of this year will reach 937,500 units, while the number of tire exports in the first quarter of this year was 727,500 units.</p>
<h3>Sweet Rain in Hunan; Rice Prices Plummet</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Changsha, 28th] Hunan Province looks promising. Sweet rain fell heavily on the 27th, and torrential rain continued all day today, and rice prices plummeted, to the delight of the people.</p>
<h3>Market Speculative Funds Shift Targets; Chinese Stocks Go From Strong to Weak; Foreign Stocks Also Decline Steadily</h3>
<p>Chinese stocks initially continued the momentum from Saturday afternoon, appearing tight. However, the appeal of gold and foreign currency aroused interest among stock market participants. Once attention shifted, speculative funds began to flow out of the stock market. Wing On Spinning, from 6300 yuan, Mei Ah, from 5300 yuan, King Fook, from 520 yuan, Sun Kwong, from 460 yuan, and Chun Hing, from 390 yuan, gradually declined. At the same time, unpopular stocks rose, with Sino-French Underwear reaching over 250 yuan, matches at 1600 yuan, and old shares also seeing calls for a 10% increase. Thus, popular stocks experienced a double whammy, with Wing On Spinning falling to 5600 yuan, Mei Ah to 4700 yuan, and King Fook to around 470 yuan. The midday close was slightly flat. Sun Kwong and Chun Hing ended at lower prices. Unpopular stocks were ultimately unsustainable, with high prices being fleeting. Some even fell back to Saturday's prices. As a result, Wing On Spinning, Mei Ah, and King Fook were flat compared to last Saturday, while Sun Kwong and Chun Hing fell by over ten yuan each. In addition, Sino Land and Wing Fung were flat. China Textile and Great China, due to their long-standing reputation, were sought after, each rising by 15%. Sino-French and New Asia Underwear saw some squeeze-ups, and old shares were also called for a 10% increase. Scattered overnight transactions in the afternoon also saw improved bids. Foreign stocks were affected by securities firms abandoning stocks and turning to gold and foreign currency activities, leading to a decline. Ewo Spinning fell steadily from a high of 17600 yuan. However, the fate of unpopular and small stocks varied. In the past few days, their gains were limited, presenting a mixed picture of both prosperity and decline. Compared to last Saturday, the midday close showed Ewo Spinning and British American Tobacco each down 1000 yuan, Paper Industry and Kwong Wei down, Ewo Brewery flat, and China Enamelware slightly up. Bids for popular stocks continued to decline in the afternoon.</p>

The Zhongsha White Sugar Association temporarily reduced the bid to 64,500 yuan, but then suspended the auction because the goods were not yet available for delivery. As a result, the price tightened again, rising to 68,500 yuan. In the afternoon, it was even tighter, with bids ranging from 69,000 yuan to 70,000 yuan, slightly flat compared to the previous day. However, the market remained firm. Three-and-a-half White Sugar was bid at 75,000 yuan.</p>

<h3>Securities Professionals Demand Resumption of Free Trading</h3>
<p>To appeal for the temporary resumption of free trading of securities, securities professionals hosted a reception yesterday at the Capital Garden for representatives from all sectors of the city and newspaper reporters. Those present included Gu Bingyuan from the Social Affairs Bureau, Wang Qiji from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, Feng You from the Central Propaganda Department, Yu Cheng, Chairman of the Securities Professionals Association, Xu Yongzuo, an accountant, and several dozen newspaper reporters. Yu Mingyue, a representative of the industry, gave a speech, stating: "Before the opening of the securities exchange, buying and selling activities occurred due to the actual needs of both parties. Securities professionals served the public as intermediaries, which did not conflict with law, reason, or human sentiment. However, recently, the administrative authorities have repeatedly ordered them to cease operations, causing the livelihood of the professionals to be cut off, and the public with securities also feels inconvenienced. Therefore, we specifically request all sectors to uphold justice." Subsequently, Xu Yongzuo, Feng You, Yu Cheng, and others stood up and spoke, generally expressing agreement with the principles of the industry's request. Gu Bingyuan, the representative of the Social Affairs Bureau, hoped that the industry would pay attention to whether the listed stocks themselves were legal, and that securities companies or firms that had not registered with the Social Affairs Bureau should quickly complete the procedures to obtain legal status.</p>
<h3>買戶爭先恐後　美鈔漲風大熾　較上週六升三百元</h3>
<h3>Buyers Scramble; US Dollar Surge Intensifies; Up 300 Yuan Compared to Last Saturday</h3>
<p>The US dollar opened at 2340 yuan, and immediately buyers rushed in, scrambling to get their hands on it. Foreign exchange dealers were unable to cope, and at one point the bid-ask spread widened to a difference of 100 yuan. After 10:00 AM, it fell back from over 2650 yuan to below 2500 yuan, but demand continued to come in, fearing that it would be impossible to buy starting next month, and it rose again to 2680 yuan, hovering around 2670 yuan at midday. In the afternoon, the gold market was brisk, and the US dollar was also boosted to over 2700 yuan. There was also a large outflow of physical currency. High prices were difficult to sustain, but sentiment remained firm and momentum did not subside. It finally ended at around 2650 yuan, up 310 yuan compared to last Saturday. Hong Kong dollar notes, being unpopular, did not have the speculative frenzy of gold and foreign currency. Even at its craziest, it could not exceed 490 yuan, and was constrained by the Hong Kong exchange rate. Although it rose, it was not much. It also rose by over thirty yuan. Hong Kong telegraphic transfers were at 4670, with outflows. Robbie was at 575 yuan. US exchange rates were flat, but supply was limited.</p>

<h3>Slight Fluctuations in the Coal Market</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the coal market initially felt excited upon hearing of rising gold prices. However, due to limited actual sales, it became weak again. Prices mostly fell, with white coal lumps and bituminous coal lumps being relatively sluggish. Market prices continued to decline slightly. Although sales of bituminous coal seams to factories in the city did not increase, purchases by out-of-town customers were active, and the market trended slightly firm. White coal nuggets and coal seams were supported at low levels.</p>

<h3>National Resources Commission Plans to Establish Refinery and Machinery Factory</h3>
<p>The three former enemy and puppet-controlled oil depots in Gaoqiao, Pudong, including Lianli, which were previously taken over by the National Resources Commission, have recently begun to be reorganized, and the establishment of the Shanghai Refinery is being planned. It is said that the original oil depot sites will soon begin refining gasoline and diesel. It is reported that the three oil depots occupy a large area and are well-equipped. After refining begins, there will be a large supply of gasoline to the city.</p>
<p>In addition, in order to develop the machinery industry, the National Resources Commission is currently planning to establish a large-scale machinery company to purchase machine tools (master machines) and equipment for manufacturing general-purpose machines from abroad. It is learned that the Commission is planning to first establish a general-purpose machine limited company to manufacture water pumps, air compressors, internal combustion engines, and hoisting equipment to meet current urgent needs.</p>
<h3>湖南紡織業　戰後產銷概況</h3>
<h3>Post-War Production and Sales of the Hunan Textile Industry</h3>
<p>According to Mr. Chen of the Hunan First Textile Factory, before the war, the Hunan provincial government established the First and Second Factories in Anjiang, with over 50,000 spindles, capable of producing 3,000 bales of cotton yarn per day. After the fall, they were moved to the rear and have now resumed operation. Due to difficulties in materials and transportation, the Second Factory has been temporarily merged into the First Factory. Approximately 20,000 spindles are currently in use, producing over 1,000 bales of yarn per day. There are also 200 looms in operation, producing as usual. In terms of raw materials, they are purchased from cotton-producing areas in the Jiangxi-Hubei border area. However, due to the obsolescence of the machinery, the quality of the cotton cloth produced is relatively coarse. Therefore, the products are mainly sold to farmers in the southwestern provinces. The factory provides military uniforms and civil service uniforms for Hunan Province at low prices. However, foreign cloth has now been transported to Hunan. Therefore, the factory's products will be sold to the northwestern provinces. The Third Yarn Factory, jointly operated by various groups, has fewer spindles and its production is not large.</p>

<h3>Quarrel Breaks Out Between Firms; All-Out Brawl in Rice Market; Flour, Oil, and Beans All Decline</h3>
<p>Since the 100 million rice loan was undertaken by 17 rice firms, including Liang San Tai and Wanchang, it has been repeatedly reported that rice has been procured. However, rice prices continue to rise daily, with japonica and indica rice approaching the 50,000 mark. At the same time, the 2,000 members of the local Rice Industry Association also stated that, although the rice firms have taken out loans to procure rice, they have not yet distributed it to the individual shops for retail sales. Yesterday, when the rice market opened, all the rice shops unanimously requested the rice firms to distribute rice, leading to a dispute between the two sides. Order broke down and chairs were overturned, making it impossible for the market to operate. Both sides sent representatives to the authorities to request a public judgment. (For details, please see today's local news in this newspaper.)</p>
<p>Yesterday, flour prices plummeted by 3-4,000 yuan due to the authorities' ban on exports and the cessation of sales in other provinces, leading hoarders to dump their stocks. The oil market saw a surge in arrivals, and shop owners, expecting a further decline, slashed prices by 8-9,000 yuan, nearly 10,000 yuan. Peanut skin prices fell by 5-600 yuan, with few buyers. Bean cake prices fell by 2-300 yuan, and raw peanut prices fell by 2-3,000 yuan, with few transactions. However, yellow soybeans rose by 2-3,000 yuan due to inquiries from Zhejiang and Fujian. Corn and red sorghum both rose by 1-2,000 yuan. Red beans were scarce, with some being procured from Southeast Asia, rising by 2-3,000 yuan.</p>

<h3>憨人領導世界前進</h3>
<h3>Fools Lead the World Forward</h3>
<p>— 楊謀</p>
<p>— Yang Mou</p>
<p>沒有憨人，畫部的歷史也許會黯然失色。歲月的推移，原是極平淡的活動的記錄，憨人憨事點綴其間，才使宇宙的生命虎虎有生氣。</p>
<p>Without fools, the history of the painting department might be dull and colorless. The passage of time is originally a record of extremely mundane activities, and it is the embellishment of fools and their foolish deeds that gives the life of the universe a vibrant energy.</p>
<p>多少政治舞毫上活躍的英雄，多少研究室中孜孜不倦的科學家，原祇都憑着一點憨勁，與舊環境舊思想舊系統搏鬥，從絕望的幽谷中開關康莊大道。</p>
<p>How many heroes active on the political stage, how many tireless scientists in the laboratory, all rely on a bit of foolish energy to fight against the old environment, old ideas, and old systems, and open up a broad road from the valley of despair.</p>
<p>成也罷，敗也罷，出發點總是相同的，爲的是堅固的信仰，不拔的憨勁而已，丟云現實的苟安的生活，背起了荊棘的十安架，去找尋理想的實現，世界上面，除了染着憨氣的，恐怕誰也不會幹吧！</p>
<p>Success or failure, the starting point is always the same, for the sake of a firm belief, an unwavering foolish energy. They abandon the life of complacent ease in reality, shoulder the thorny cross, and seek the realization of ideals. In this world, who would do it except for those who are tainted with foolishness?</p>
<p>固然，理想的夢還距離得渺遠，，自已却已受陵得千瘡百孔，頽然倒下的，書不勝書。但是，在歷史上留下名字</p>
<p>Admittedly, the dream of ideals is still far away, and they themselves are riddled with holes, collapsing and falling. There are countless books about it. However, their names remain in history.</p>
<p>基督的精神，伽利略的精神，都替人類的進程，註下了最光輝的一頁。一切無恥的卑賤的阻撓一都只是徒然的白費心力而已。</p>
<p>The spirit of Christ, the spirit of Galileo, have all marked the most glorious page in the progress of mankind. All shameless, base obstruction is just a futile waste of effort.</p>
<p>世界是必然前進的，憨人領導着世界的前進。誰也阻不了這洪流，阻遏也是枉然。</p>
<p>The world is bound to advance, and fools lead the world forward. No one can stop this torrent, and obstruction is in vain.</p>

<h3>四月五月好辰光</h3>
<h3>April and May: Good Times</h3>
<p>— 姜建邦</p>
<p>— Jiang Jianbang</p>
<p>我們只知道每年四月和五月是最適宜於遊玩的季節，不知道四”和五月也正是最利於工作的時候。心理學者吿訴我們，一年中工作最有效率的月份是五月，四月，九月，七月，八月，和三月。效率最小的月份是二月，十二月，十月，一月，十一月和六月。</p>
<p>We only know that April and May are the best seasons for playing, but we don't know that April and May are also the best times for working. Psychologists tell us that the most efficient months of the year for working are May, April, September, July, August, and March. The least efficient months are February, December, October, January, November, and June.</p>
<p>四月和五月是人類的最大恩人。在這時候，我們的工作最有效率，我們也最喜歡活動。在不寒不暖，風和日煦的情形下，給我們安排了一個最適宜於工作的壞境。</p>
<p>April and May are the greatest benefactors of mankind. At this time, our work is most efficient and we also enjoy activities the most. In the not-too-cold, not-too-warm, breezy, and sunny conditions, they arrange an environment that is best suited for work.</p>
<p>天氣不斷的稍有變化，（連續持久者例外），可以引起活動的興趣和工作的慾望。四月和五月正合這個條件。淸晨和黃昏雖然有些冷意，但到中午，就感到有些熟了。在這種變化中，使我們有了活動的刺激。</p>
<p>Constant and slight changes in the weather (except for continuous and persistent ones) can arouse interest in activities and a desire to work. April and May fit this condition. Although it is a bit cold in the early morning and dusk, it feels a bit warmer by noon. In this kind of change, we have a stimulus for activity.</p>
<p>世界上許多偉大的著作和發明，都是出於四月和五月。大詩人但丁寫新生是在四月，寫神曲是在三月。米爾頓的失樂園是在某年的四月開始的。歌德寫少年維特之煩惱是在秋天，寫浮士德是在三月，寫色覺論是在五月。達爾文進化論的觀念是萌芽於某年的三月，哥俞布環遊地球的思想是發生在五月，加利略發現土星圈是在四月，發現太陽斑點是在五月，風雨表的發明也在五月。可見在四五月裏，我們的思想最活躍。統計者吿訴我們，世界上偉大的發明以五月爲最多，四月次之。</p>
<p>Many of the world's great works and inventions came out of April and May. The great poet Dante wrote *La Vita Nuova* in April and *Divine Comedy* in March. Milton's *Paradise Lost* began in April of a certain year. Goethe wrote *The Sorrows of Young Werther* in autumn, *Faust* in March, and *Theory of Colours* in May. Darwin's concept of evolution germinated in March of a certain year, Columbus' idea of circumnavigating the earth occurred in May, Galileo discovered the rings of Saturn in April, discovered sunspots in May, and the invention of the barometer was also in May. It can be seen that our minds are most active in April and May. Statisticians tell us that the world's great inventions are most numerous in May, followed by April.</p>
<p>我國以五月爲多事之秋。除了國際性的五一節以外，有五三，五四，五五，五七，五九，五卅等紀念日。可見五月裏人們活動性的厲害了。</p>
<p>In our country, May is a season of many events. In addition to the international May Day, there are commemorative days such as May 3rd, May 4th, May 5th, May 7th, May 9th, and May 30th. It can be seen how powerful the activity of people in May is.</p>
<p>在四月和五月裏，我們的工作最是正確。銀行裏記賬員的錯誤最多是發生在十月，十一月，和十二月裘；錯誤最少的是五月四月和九月。在這些時候，我們的心境愉快，腦子淸爽，最利於工作。</p>
<p>In April and May, our work is the most accurate. The most mistakes made by bank tellers occur in October, November, and December; the fewest mistakes are made in May, April, and September. At these times, our minds are happy, and our brains are clear, making it most conducive to work.</p>
<p>春天來了，我們的身體好像輕快了許多，好像有了勤勞的習慣，不願做的事，這時願做了。懶洋洋的心情會給春神趕走的。</p>
<p>Spring has come, and our bodies seem much lighter, as if we have developed a habit of diligence. Things we were unwilling to do, we are now willing to do. The lazy mood will be driven away by the goddess of spring.</p>
<p>春天是慈母，在她的懷抱裏可以像孩子一樣的跳躍遊玩，享受甜蜜的溫情，但是我們也要用比較嚴肅的態度來過它－－在這個工作最有效率的時候，多做些工作。</p>
<p>Spring is a kind mother, and in her embrace, we can jump and play like children, enjoying sweet tenderness. But we must also spend it with a more serious attitude—do more work at this time when work is most efficient.</p>
<p>今年的四月已去其半；但五月不久即到。桃花憶落，楊柳垂青·換上輕鬆的春服，打起點精神，轉向你的工作吧，莫再蹉跎，失掉這一段最好的時光！</p>
<p>Half of April this year has already passed, but May will arrive soon. Peach blossoms remember falling, and willows droop green. Change into light spring clothes, cheer up a bit, and turn to your work, don't procrastinate any longer, and lose this best time!</p>

<h3>瀋陽的文化界</h3>
<h3>The Cultural Scene in Shenyang</h3>
<p>— 陳烟帆</p>
<p>— Chen Yanfan</p>
<p>瀋陽的報紙現在共有四種，一是遼瀋日報，一是中蘇日報，另外是靑年日報和「和平日報」。靑年日報是靑年軍二〇七師辦的，但是我還沒有看見過。和平日報比較最有歷史，他的前身是掃蕩報，內容比較最充實一點。最近還有一種大報將要出版，那便是前進報。前進一報是接收了盛京日報改出的，所以設備都相當完善。這　　　原來　在錦州出版，後來因爲環境的需要，乃改來瀋陽籌備。我在十天以前到瀋陽的，本來還要到長春去，可是爲了參加前進報，也許一時便不能離開。</p>
<p>There are currently four newspapers in Shenyang. One is *Liaoshen Daily*, one is *China-Soviet Daily*, and the others are *Youth Daily* and *"Peace Daily"*. *Youth Daily* is run by the 207th Division of the Youth Army, but I haven't seen it yet. *Peace Daily* has the most history, its predecessor being *Sweeping Bandits Daily*, and its content is more substantial. Recently, another large newspaper is about to be published, namely *Forward Daily*. *Forward Daily* was transformed from *Shengjing Daily*, so the equipment is quite complete. This [newspaper] was originally published in Jinzhou, but later, due to environmental needs, it was changed to Shenyang for preparation. I arrived in Shenyang ten days ago, and I was originally going to Changchun, but in order to participate in *Forward Daily*, I may not be able to leave for a while.</p>
<p>瀋陽的報紙雖然有這一些。可是在街上，幾乎看不到一個報販。像上海那樣到處擺着花花緣綠的雜誌報童的報攤，在瀋陽是沒有的。瀋陽的街上多的是馬車，「得，得……」「有，有……呼喝　馬之聲不絕。沒有到這裏之前，我沒有想到潘陽是這樣個個地方。潘陽的建築市容和地域的寬展，都不比上海弱。北地就是多風，而且地燥，走在街上，時時風沙蔽天，這時候口眾是必不可少的。</p>
<p>Although there are some newspapers in Shenyang, you can hardly see a newspaper vendor on the street. There are no newsstands with boys displaying colorful magazines like in Shanghai. There are many carriages on the streets of Shenyang, and the sounds of "De, de..." "Yo, yo..." and shouting at the horses never cease. Before coming here, I didn't expect Shenyang to be such a place. Shenyang's architecture, cityscape, and territorial expanse are no weaker than Shanghai's. The northern region is windy and dry, and when walking on the street, the wind and sand often obscure the sky. At this time, masks are essential.</p>
<p>爲了目前瀋陽在各方而的重要性，上海和平津各地的記者都差不多已集中到這裏了。申報的韓淸濤先生，一月前我去北鎭縣時他在那邊，後來我在溝帮子時聽說他也在那邊，他到瀋陽恐怕也在我之前。康正平最近亦在此地出現。這裏雜誌之類的刊物幾乎看不見。有也不過二三種。我這十天以來正想籌備出一份綜合半月刋。定名爲「松花江」。自已的期望是很大的，不知道出來之後是什麽樣子。</p>
<p>Due to the current importance of Shenyang in all aspects, reporters from Shanghai, Peiping, and Tianjin have almost all gathered here. Mr. Han Qingtao of *Shen Bao* was in Beizhen County when I went there a month ago. Later, when I was in Goubangzi, I heard that he was also there. He probably arrived in Shenyang before me. Kang Zhengping has also recently appeared here. Magazines and other publications are almost invisible here. There are only two or three types. In the past ten days, I have been thinking of preparing a comprehensive semi-monthly publication, named "Songhua River". My expectations are very high, but I don't know what it will be like after it comes out.</p>

<h3>麥帥小史</h3>
<h3>A Short Biography of MacArthur</h3>
<p>— 鍾佐</p>
<p>— Zhong Zuo</p>
<p>現任聯合國駐日最高統帥麥克沃塞元帥，在一八八〇年誕生於美國阿肯色州的力特爾洛克城。他父親亞麥克沃塞將軍，南北戰爭時，曾因屢次戰勝，而得國會的榮譽獎章，不久又在菲列濱戰役中得名，於是任菲島第一任軍事總督。</p>
<p>General of the Army Douglas MacArthur, the current Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers in Japan, was born in 1880 in Little Rock, Arkansas, USA. His father, General Arthur MacArthur Jr., received the Congressional Medal of Honor for repeated victories during the American Civil War. He soon gained fame in the Philippine-American War and became the first military governor of the Philippines.</p>
<p>麥帥非常服從他的母親，他母親對他的前途有極大的影響。每逢麥帥的生日，她必有一次長而重要的談話，勉勵他的將來，她給麥帥種下一種印象：他是一側具有榮譽星章名將的兒子。她繼續管理麥帥，直到八十二歲時才逝世。</p>
<p>MacArthur was very obedient to his mother, and she had a great influence on his future. On MacArthur's birthday, she would always have a long and important conversation to encourage his future, instilling in MacArthur the impression that he was the son of a famous general with a medal of honor. She continued to manage MacArthur until she passed away at the age of eighty-two.</p>
<p>一八九九年麥帥入西點軍校，一九〇三年以全級第一名畢業，他得到百年來軍校中從未有的最高分數紀綠，四年中他的平均分數是九八，一四。</p>
<p>In 1899, MacArthur entered West Point Military Academy, and in 1903, he graduated at the top of his class. He obtained the highest score record in the military academy in a century, with an average score of 98.14 over four years.</p>
<p>他一半因爲他父親的關係，所以常覺得他的命運與菲列濱有密切的聯繫。他在菲島的第一個工作是測量雷伊泰島有軍事價値的海濱地帶，四十二年後麥帥竟會領導美軍登陸該島。</p>
<p>Partly because of his father's relationship, he often felt that his fate was closely linked to the Philippines. His first job in the Philippines was to survey the coastal areas of Leyte Island with military value. Forty-two years later, MacArthur would lead the US military to land on the island.</p>
<p>日俄戰爭時，麥帥的父親任美軍事觀察隊長，麥帥就在他父親手下任隨員，駐在東京。他在這一個時期，以及在菲島的幾年中，曾悉心硏究日本國民心理。</p>
<p>During the Russo-Japanese War, MacArthur's father served as the head of the US military observation team, and MacArthur served as his aide, stationed in Tokyo. During this period, as well as in the Philippines for several years, he carefully studied the Japanese national psyche.</p>
<p>第一次世界大戰時，麥帥任美軍中最年靑的師團長，不久轉任西點軍校監督。</p>
<p>During World War I, MacArthur served as the youngest division commander in the US Army, and soon transferred to be the superintendent of West Point Military Academy.</p>
<p>一九二三年，麥帥又回到菲列濱，任旅團長，負責踏勘巴坦島的防禦工程。</p>
<p>In 1923, MacArthur returned to the Philippines again, serving as a brigade commander, responsible for surveying the defense projects of Bataan Island.</p>
<p>一九三〇年至一九三年間，麥帥任參謀總長，一九三五年後再回菲島，開訓練及編制菲島國民軍，並不斷增强該島防禦，以應付不能避免的日美戰爭。</p>
<p>From 1930 to 1935, MacArthur served as Chief of Staff. In 1935, he returned to the Philippines again to train and organize the Philippine National Army, and constantly strengthen the island's defenses to cope with the inevitable Japanese-American War.</p>

<h3>台灣有屋無人住</h3>
<h3>Houses in Taiwan are Empty</h3>
<p>— 乃藩</p>
<p>— Naifan</p>
<p>在上海，窒息在鴿　般的小屋子裏的人們，來到合灣，會深深的舒了一口氣。</p>
<p>People in Shanghai, suffocating in pigeon-sized houses, will take a deep breath when they come to Taiwan.</p>
<p>台灣有五十萬以上的日橋，現在差不多已撤退完畢，他們在台灣，都是天之驕子，都有很好的房子住，有些是私人建造的，大部分却是公家供給的。各機關的公務員，各工廠的職員，各學校的敎員，都有公家供給的住宅，現在，這些房屋，都已空下來，移交給新的主人。</p>
<p>There are more than 500,000 Japanese in Taiwan, and they have now almost all withdrawn. In Taiwan, they are all the darlings of heaven and live in good houses. Some are privately built, but most are provided by the government. Civil servants of various agencies, employees of various factories, and teachers of various schools all have government-provided housing. Now, these houses are all empty and handed over to new owners.</p>
<p>到合灣來的公務員，第一件大事似乎就是找房子。房子是到處可有的，你只要認定了一座，向主管機關備了案，領一張日產接管委員會的封條貼上，或者就由自己的機關寫一張封條，亦無不可。這房子便算是你的了。</p>
<p>For civil servants coming to Taiwan, the first major thing seems to be finding a house. Houses are available everywhere. You just need to identify one, file a record with the competent authority, receive a seal from the Japanese Property Takeover Committee, or have your own agency write a seal. That house is considered yours.</p>
<p>可是，房子雖然很多，要住却並不容易。日本人搬走的時候，屋內的電綫水道等等，先就有相常的破壞。搬走以後，更會有靑小來把門窗拆去，臉紅心跳「塔塔米」攆走。或者你進宅以後，一不留意，便會有樑上君子光降，把衣物傢具，席捲而去，使你覺得做這新屋子的主人，也不是一件容易的事。</p>
<p>However, although there are many houses, it is not easy to live in them. When the Japanese moved out, the electrical wiring, water pipes, etc. in the house had already been considerably damaged. After moving out, there will be young people who come to tear down the doors and windows, blushing and chasing away the "tatami". Or, after you move in, if you are not careful, there will be gentlemen on the beams who will come and sweep away your clothes, furniture, making you feel that being the owner of this new house is not an easy thing.</p>
<p>話雖這麽說，許多空屋子畢竟有大人先生們住入了。「王侯第宅皆新主，文武衣冠異昔時」，在含灣誰都要興今昔之感吧？</p>
<p>Having said that, many empty houses have been moved into by great men and gentlemen. "The houses of kings and nobles all have new owners, and the attire of civil and military officials is different from the past." Who in Taiwan would not feel a sense of the past and present?</p>

<p>Cao Wenquan asks: I serve in a department store, and my income is very small. Unfortunately, in April of the 32nd year of the Republic, due to frequent drinking and strenuous exercise, my feet unconsciously became swollen, making it difficult to move. Later, my face and body also became swollen. The doctor diagnosed chronic nephritis. At that time, the doctor tried his best to treat me, and the swelling subsided, but my physical strength was weak. In the past two years, it has recurred from time to time. I have no effective cure. I admire your enthusiasm for rescuing the poor and sick. Please advise on a treatment method.</p>
<p>醫學博土余新恩答病名慢性腎臟炎，無特效藥，浮　有二原因：（二）血中蛋白質由尿中漏出，（二）氯化物滯留體內。補救辦法：（一）多進蛋白質，（二）淡食並少飲水，菜肴因少用鹽而乏味，可以葫菽，醋，葱，或大　等拌味替代。</p>
<p>Doctor of Medicine Yu Xinen answers: The disease is chronic nephritis, and there is no specific medicine. There are two reasons for the swelling: (1) protein in the blood leaks out from the urine, and (2) chloride is retained in the body. Remedial measures: (1) eat more protein, and (2) eat lightly and drink less water. Dishes are bland due to the lack of salt, so they can be replaced with gourds, vinegar, green onions, or garlic to add flavor.</p>

<h3>Tracking Down Lost Persons</h3>
<p>Seeking Mother and Uncle Zhou Jiaji The person I am seeking is Zhou Jiaji, a sergeant of the 638th Regiment of the 208th Division of the Youth Army. He has served in the military for nine years. Due to transportation disruptions, he has been unable to communicate with his family. Recently, he followed the army to Hangzhou, and originally requested leave to go to Shanghai, hoping to reunite with his mother, from whom he had been separated for eight years. Unexpectedly, after arriving in Shanghai, his mother, Chen Wangshi, had disappeared, and his uncle, Zhou Jia君, had also moved elsewhere. Please ask your esteemed newspaper to relay this information to relatives and friends. If anyone knows the whereabouts of his mother and uncle, please send a letter to Chen Chunlin (nicknamed A Lin), No. 29 Changrong Road, Chengdu South Road, Shanghai.</p>
<p>Seeking Wu Kezhen, age 30, from Xueyan Bridge, Wuxi. He worked as a ticket seller for the Jiangnan Motor Company in Nanjing during the July 7th Incident (Marco Polo Bridge Incident). Later, he withdrew westward with the company. To this day, there has been no news of him. His parents are extremely anxious. If any relatives or friends know of his whereabouts, please kindly inform Liu Zian of Li Su Printing Society, No. 56 Jingde Road, Suzhou. Your help would be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>Seeking Anti-Japanese Comrade He Wuchu Mr. He is from Tinglin, Songjiang, age 24. He was originally a practitioner of traditional Chinese medicine. After the war, he stepped forward and joined the Tinglin branch of the Three People's Principles Youth League, engaging in anti-enemy work. He was once ordered to go to eastern Zhejiang to continue the resistance. For eight long and arduous years, we frequently received letters from him. Who knew that for the past five months or so, there has been no news at all? His mother is shedding tears of old age, deeply distressed. Please, kind and virtuous people, inform us of the truth. The merit of your action will be immeasurable. (Correspondence can be forwarded to Guo Yongzhang, Maogang, Songjiang).</p>
<p>Inquiry Regarding Asia Lin Baosheng Whereabouts of Lin Shisheng, a coppersmith formerly working in the lower levels, are now sought. His mother has sent a letter from overseas. It is hoped that relatives and friends will quickly notify Mr. Wang Hanmin of the Asia General Company. Your help would be appreciated.</p>
