<p>〔本報南京廿七日電〕蔣代表中正廿八日上午九時將以國府主席之身份，出席國大第三次大會，並以極隆重之儀式，將中華民國憲法草案提交大會討論，並向全體代表講述憲草草擬經過。此一節目將爲我國民主政治之先聲，還政於民之伊始，故蔣主席廿八日是將全副戎裝，佩帶勳韋蒞會，舉行提交儀式時，並將奏樂，同時有外賓出席，實爲我　政之肇始大典。第三次大會除上項儀式及蔣主席報吿外，有秘書處報吿上决會議紀錄及賀常，下午續開大會時，將由孫科報吿，憲草討論即自廿八日始，又代表座次廿八日仍用原座次，廿九日起依照新抽定席次。又共黨及民盟之席决仍保留，以待彼等隨時參加，而示政府寬大爲懷之態度。此項新席次業已印刷成册，廿八日下午即可分送各代表及記者備用。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿七日電〕國大主席團廿七日上午十時舉行第六次會，出席者蔣中正·左舜生·陳啓天·劉蘅靜等，由鄒魯主席，決議事項如次：甲，代表資格審查委員會，由下列三部份構成：（一）各單位推選主席團候選人之召集人，（二）各單位推選主席團候選人之得票次多數者，（三）國大代表選舉總事務所主任張代表厲生。以上列三部份人員爲委員，並由張代表厲生召集之。乙，大會討論憲草程序，決定由國府蔣主席將中華民國憲法草案向大會提出。其討論程序，係先作大體討諭，然後分章進行。內，第三次大會主席原擬推蔣代表中正，茲改推胡代表適担任。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿七日電〕廿八日國大第三次大會主席團除胡適外，係第三組之曾琦·白崇禧·陳果夫·朱經農·胡庶華·何成濬·梁寒操·黃芸蘇·段錫朋·徐傅霖等十人。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿七日電〕國大代表蕙七日報到七人，區域代表二人，職業代表二人，社會賢達晏陽初·國府直接遴選陶希聖·民社黨蒯超，連前共計報到一六二三人，國府公佈者一七四四人，尙有一二一人未報到。又國大職員證章及出入證，將再度更換，廿八日晨先換發臨時出入證，廿九日用新證。</p>
<h3 id="c2">召開國大修改憲草　均根據政協決議　彭部長於記者會上宣稱 <a href="#c2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿七日電〕中宣部廿七日下午三時半，就國大會堂代表休息室舉行記者會，由彭學沛主持，並邀新任駐敎廷公使吳經熊出席，備各記者對憲草方面之質詢。首由彭答記者詢問如决</p>
<p>問：國大代表中各黨派所公佈名額及其分配如何？</p>
<p>答：國大代表名額總數爲二〇五〇名，經國府公佈者一七四四各，其中無黨派者八四七名，佔總數百分之四十八，其决爲國民黨七二五人，佔總數百分之四十二，其餘爲靑年黨一一八名，民社黨五四各，兩者共佔百分之十。關於鐵派問題，當民二十七年第一次國民參政會開會時，有社會民主黨，共產黨，靑年黨，以及國民黨，其中三鐵業已參加國大。又今春召開政協，有國民黨，共產黨，靑年黨，社會賢達，民盟，五方面參加，現其中僅共鐵及民盟一部份人士未參加國太，故所謂國民黨一黨開國大，乃是不對的附和者，亦屬錯誤。</p>
<p>問：一部份人批評政府已破壞政協決議，尊意如何？</p>
<p>答：對此問題最好之答覆、即是憲草。因目前修正之中華民國憲草，係依據政協決議而修訂者。其次吾人可試觀何人首先促東北採取軍事行動，何人不斷破壞交通，拒絕參加國府委員會，拒絕提名，拒絕參加國大？且暗巾進行所謂人民大會，使政協決議不能實行之責任屬於何人，自不難明知。</p>
<p>問：國大究符合政協決議至何種程度？</p>
<p>答：其未違背政協者，可以三點說明之：（一）日期：政協決定國大本年五月五日召開，旋經共然及其他鐵派要求，延期至十一月，屆期共黨仍拒不參加，此可明暸熱心履行政協決議者爲誰，而不熱心者又爲誰？（二）名額：目前名額之分配，仍係依據政協決議，共鐵及民盟之空位，現仍留待彼等參加。（三）憲草係依據政協決議予以修正而供國大採納者。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿七日電〕記渚廿七日於中宣部招待會上，就合衆社特派員羅根南京廿六日電訊所載政府發言人聲稱，倘共產鐵決定召開所謂解放區人民大會，同時共軍繼續進攻綏南楡林時，則國軍將對延安發動討伐攻勢一點詢彭部長，據答：「關於共產黨企圖召開所謂解放區人民大會一節，政府確曾獲得報吿，但至望其非確實，至合衆社電訊所載各節，並非本人談話，可能係由於同日中失社稿之傳誤。</p>
<h3 id="c3">京中共發言人否認召開人大 <a href="#c3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿七日電〕中共辦事處發言人梅益，廿七日晚對報載共軍將在解放區召開人民大會及八路軍進攻楡林兩事，予以吾認，表示決無此事。並對報載某軍事觀察家所稱「政府將被迫進攻延安」事，謂政府進攻延安之能態度早有所聞，唯此項消息發出後，是否自即日起將出之於行動，此點極堪注意。此項消息並已於本日發電至延安邊區政府矣。梅氏復對外傳毛澤東離延安赴蘇說于以否認，因本月廿九日爲朱德六十壽辰，毛將留延安祝賀，決不致離去也。</p>
<h3 id="c4">中共高級將領　傾軋益表面化 <a href="#c4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>〔中央社西安廿七日電〕此間獲悉：延安中共方面高級將領間之傾軋，已日行表面化，毛澤東領導其直系將領朱德，賀龍，林彪，陳毅，劉伯誠等堅主以軍事奪取政權，而陳紹禹，馮文彬，王稼穡，陸定一，劉少奇，李富春等，則主張以政治爭取政權，因而毛又實行第二次整風運動，打擊陳派，並飭黨員監視其行動人自由，避免緊急危難，維持社會秩序或增進公共利益必要者外，不得以法律限制之」。余曾研得一條似較張君勱先生爲佳，但爲民主起見，乃將其放棄。</p>
<p>（三）第三章關於增列規定　立監委國大代表一點，受國父信徒之指責，認爲立監兩院乃治權機構，國大爲政權機構，應各自獨立，不能混淆，但因張君勱先生堅持議會政治原則，吾人雖認爲依國父遺敎，立監院應對國大負責，但終亦讓步。余意政權，治權，於邏輯上係分立者，實際上則宜有所溝通，以便靈活遝用，且目前亦有若干立委與政治官吏爲國大代表之事實。</p>
<p>（四）第四章關於總統之權限，極少變動，政協決議曾欲將五五憲草第四十五條「總統得召集五院院長，會商關於二院以上事項及總統諮詢事項」刪去，但於最後一次審議會上（共產鐵代表未出席），經張君勱先生指出，如院間發生爭執，旣不能候國大開會，復乏專人或機構可任調停，則爭執何由解決？政事必大受影響，後又決定讓步，更訂爲「總統對院與院間之爭執，除本憲法已有規定者外，得召集有關各院院長，會商解決之」。</p>
<p>（五）關於立法院與行政院之關係一點，五五憲草乃各目獨立，無須向國大負實者。今採擇政協決議，更訂爲行政院院長之任命，總統須得立法院之同意行之，而行政院對若干事項，亦須對立法院負責，是已接納若干美憲之制衡原則，可謂限制之總統制，而帶些須內閣制之意味。</p>
<p>（六）第十章關於中央與地方之權限，依政協決議，較五五憲草增改若干，全國之政制固非聯邦制，亦非絕對之單一制，此抓新型之制度，可視爲我國對憲法之貢獻。至省長民選，提高省地位一點，固政協決議亦國父之本意。</p>
<p>（七）憲法之解釋，自民十四起至今，每稿皆有更動，五五憲草規定爲由監察院提出，司法院行之，修正案則以之屬司法院，蓋已確定司法院爲最高司法機構故然。吳氏首以英文解釋，繼以中文略譯取譬，造詞娓娓動聽，氏並聲明：出席招待會雖係應彭部長邀約，但各項解釋意見，則非代表官方，僅係以私人資格發言。最後並抒其個人對修正案之意見稱：「余以爲法律乃一種實際科學，其所以能付實施，能有行動，必須獲得衆人之擁護。今修正案旣包括各方意見，實較五五憲草完善易行，故雖修改五五憲草，予對修正案，仍由衷表示滿意。」</p>

<p>〔本報南京廿七日電〕五五憲草原起草人及參加憲草修正者吳經熊，廿七日下午於中宣部記者招待會席上，解釋修正案要點如下：</p>
<p>第一章第一條五五憲草屬爲「中華民國爲三民主義共和國」，今依各黨派之意見，更可爲「中華民國基於三民主義爲民有，民治，民享之民主共和國」，文字雖較累贅，精神則無大差異，其與美國所不同者，爲林肯總統所稱之民有，（Of　the　people），民治，（by　the　people），民享，（for　the　people），乃係指政府（Government）之性質。修正案之民有，（Owned　by　the　people），民治，（Governed　by　the　people），民享，（Enjoyed　by　the　people），則係　國家（Rcpublic　the　wealth）。民有，（of　the　people），要治，（by　the　people），民享，（for　the　people），乃係折政府（Government）之性質。</p>
<p>（二）第二章關於人民之自由，五五憲草有「非依法律不得限制之」句，今依政協決議以積極之保陣代替消極之保障，將其取銷，但爲防止自由流於放縱之危險，加列第二十四條：「關於以上所列之自由權利，除爲防止妨礙他</p>

<p>〔本報南京廿七日電〕記者頃就外傳民社鐵有考慮脫離民盟之說，往詢民社黨中常委蔣勻田，據稱：並非民社鐵一定要離開民盟，而是彼此意見是否相同，如果不相同，自然只有分開至於外傳張東蓀，胡海門之脫離民社鐵一事，亦決無根據，又政協秘長雷震，廿七日晚曾宴民社黨蔣勻田，徐傅霖，伍憲子，楊浚明</p>

<p>國民大會經激烈辯論後，已將議事規則予以通過，並定於本日上午，舉行第三次大會，將由蔣主席親自將憲法草案提出討論。這次國民大會的任務，端在制定一部切實可行的民主憲法，故自今天起，國民大會可謂已步入正式開始制憲的階段了。</p>
<p>在過去幾天之內，國大開會的情形，不免有些雜亂，致使國大進展遲緩；民主政治本來就是消費時間的政治，何况我們剛剛在開始學習民主政治的過程中，遇到大會討論問題時，自然難免辯論不休，故以一般情形而論，尙堪滿意，尤其是若干代表的慷慨陳詞，充滿了民主的精神；在我國政治史上，當可目爲新政風的開端。</p>
<p>惟從今天起，國大開始討論憲法草案了。誰都知道憲法是國家的根本大法，有關乎立國根本，是一部爲全國共同遵守的法典，一方面要有遠大的理想，另一方面，又要顧及國家的現實情况。而國人對於憲法的理想，各有其主張，各有其憧憬；對於國家的現實情况，也各有其認識，各有其見解；所以國人對於憲法的理想及其本質，造成意見龐雜的情形，是不可避免的。國大代表在討論憲草的時候如果不能從大處落墨，對於任何問題，均欲辯論不休，則國大會期，勢必曠日持久，不知要到何月何日，始能完成其制憲的任務？這樣對於政治將發生伺種影響？國大對於人民又將產生何種印象？這都是値得國大代表注意的。</p>
<p>這幾天來，各方面對於行將提出國大討論的憲法草案，紛紛發表意見，國人這樣重視未來的根本大法，本來是一種可喜的現象，但是各方提供的意見，都偏於政策方面；我們認爲制憲是國家的百年大計，除了沒有時間性的根本國策，應加以規定而外，其他普通的政策，應無庸規定在憲法中，可待未來新政府的宣佈。依照英法民主國家的先例，任何內閣在宣吿成立之後，就該向議會宣佈其施政方針。所以憲草未詳細規定普通的政策，不能視爲憲草的缺點，因爲憲法不能作繁瑣的規定。此其一。政治制度沒有絕對的善，也沒有絕對的惡，所謂有利必有弊，不論是美國式的總統制或是英國式的內閣制，都是利害參半的；只要適合我國國情，切實易行，都可以採取，切不必拘泥於某一種，因而發生爭議。此其二。五五憲草，雖爲立法院長期縝密討論而制定，但是時已隔八九年，不免有不合適時宜之處；甫經立法院所通過的修正案，雖然不能說是盡善盡美，但至少已較五五憲草爲進步。國大代表對此，決不可少存偏見。此其三。</p>
<p>要之，我們希望國大代表，對於憲法重大關鍵所在的地方，大家不要放鬆，而應認眞討論，儘量發表意見，務使國大充滿了各種意見，然後由大會融會貫通，折衷至當，以作賢明的抉擇。至於憲法條款，千萬不要咬文嚼字，要求一改再改，這些可讓長於立法技術的專家，多負些修正的責任。這樣國大的制憲工作，必能有美滿的結果。</p>

<p>〔法國新聞社紐約廿七日電〕四强鑒於過去數星期來之會議陷於絕境，今日已轉變方向，改取「秘密外交」策略。四外長假亞斯多慶亞旅館員爾納斯國務卿之特別會客室中舉行密議，討論義大利和約，特別是特港間題，除譯員外摒絕他人參加。四强間此種談判之新動向，由蘇外長莫洛托夫開其端。莫氏因貝卿對於會議之進展遲緩，表示悲觀，爰要求與貝卿單獨會面，以便開誠討論，加速外長會議之工作。貝鄕前此在巴黎和會中，雖堅持「公開外交」，但竟接受莫氏之建議，蓋貝卿最近亦感覺公開討論有極大之不便。政界觀察家以爲蘇聯如願出以讓步，英美如願就若干點與蘇聯妥協，則對於此項促成協議所不可避免的退讓，自有竭力减少公開之必要。此項秘密談話之機會。今日在貝卿招待三外長之午餐中得之。咖啡旣畢，四外長即秘密討論特港問題，尤其是特港總督權力及外國駐軍撤退問題，觀察家雖揣測尙未有所決定，但樂觀之氣氛瀰漫。四外長明日將在貝卿之茶會中恢復密議。觀察家之意，此種談判方式縱可疵議，但重要者在其結果，只要此種談判與國際公法與道義之新原則長此脗合，則經由所謂落伍方法而獲得之，實亦無傷大雅云。</p>
<p>〔聯合社紐約廿六日電〕國務卿貝爾納斯昨日與蘇聯外長莫洛托夫直接晤談後，今日復與英外相貝文密談，覓求方法减少小國方面對於大國否決權之疵議。蘇聯堅主憲章不能任意修改，是否願意退讓，尙無任何具體跡象。此類單獨晤談之目的，乃在加速外長會議工作，而以美國自動修改否決權使用間題之提議爲基礎。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕舊金山廿七日廣播：關於國外駐軍數目調查問題，各國代表在聯大會中之辯論，愈趨激烈，目前已到達極爲明顯之決定階段。蘇聯代表之長篇理論，一言蔽之，已明白吿其他國家曰：「你們假使想知道蘇軍有多少，請你們先說出你們一共有多少原子彈」。上項問題辯論已有五日，一無結果。</p>
<p>〔聯合社成功湖廿六日電〕蘇聯外長莫洛托夫今日在聯大會政治安全委會率直質問美英兩國，是否準備將各該國平時所有原子彈及火箭等武器，立即提出報吿，政治委會會議因此又起糾紛。英代表諾爾貝克亦即熱烈反攻，謂渠　此準備，一如莫洛托夫及處聯然。美代表康納利則並未直接答覆。會議熱烈辯論三小時，休會至星期三，此外，關於報吿駐軍問題之僵局，一時仍無打開之望。蘇美英三大國對於此事原則上雖同意，但以何方法及在何處調查，則意見紛歧。蘇聯要求調查者爲國外駐軍，基地及軍事設備，所謂國外包括前敵性國在內。美國則欲進一步調查國外以及國內全部軍隊。英國贊成美國此種主張，但認爲應由安理會派遺調查團實地覆核，美國則反對此舉。今日會議時莫洛托夫並答覆諾爾貝克，謂其建議如加以推廣，自當包括武器在內，所謂武器則又須包括原子彈，飛彈及其他一切武器。軍隊無武器何能作戰，如僅調查武裝部隊人數，問題仍未解決云。關於調查國內軍隊問題，莫洛托夫雖仍不同意，但主張聯合各國可將「其領土內之武裝部隊及軍備提出報吿，安理會即可從事討論裁軍問題」。</p>

<p>〔法國新聞社成功湖廿六日電〕蘇代表　羅米柯今日在託管委會中支持印度，抨擊南非之種族歧視政策。其言曰，聯合國職責所在，乃在取消種族與宗敎的歧視，此乃社會大禍，蘇聯憲法中已加以禁止。南非代表史末資君以南非境內印僑之待遇優於黑人爲言，證明歧視案已發生雙胞云。葛氏反對以本案提交國際法庭處理。</p>

<p>（二）關於調劑工業資金：（價）對於增加生產協助建設之長期低利貸款，本爲國家之中心任務。數千年來積極辦理，尚貝相當成效。（乙）工廠貸款以原料及成品爲抵押，對於工廠需要及銀行規定，雙方均尚能兼顧。（丙）各項農貸，（包括水利貸款）中國，交通及中國農民等銀行，業均照預定計劃，分別實施。（丁）國家款手續，亦經督促盡量簡化。（戌）實物貸款利弊互見，乎續亦殊堪研究，現四聯總處已在切實研究中。（巳）組織復興投資公司，前次上海工商業代表來京請願，已有此項建議，經核原則可行。（三）關於發展國際貿易者：（甲）進出口連鎖制度，在現行管理外滙辦法下，是否適宜，殊堪研究，經濟部業集各機關商討，認爲顧慮之處頗多。一·葉進口者，未必兼營出口。背有連鎖原旨。二·如僅就金額連鎖，如此是都即能限制入超，仍有疑問。三·如依貨物總類予以連鎖，我國所須者大部爲機器，棉花，食米等物品，而應鼓勵輸出者，爲茶葉，桐油，豬　，及農產品等，強迫棉花輸出事，實有顧慮，應加考慮。（乙）易貿制度，中央信託局現沒有易貿處，已由本部錢帶司函詢，日後再復。（丙）關於海外市塲，丈夫現正注意力謀擴展。（丁）現行貨物稅仍照已往總稅成規，對運銷國外貨品，得退稅或免稅，對於發展國際貿易，並無影響。（四）關於活　本市金融者：（甲）一般土地金融，已責成中國農業銀行辦理。（乙）銀行法草案，規定銀行承受不動產，應於一年內處分，此項不動產，係因清償債務所受領者若延不處分，將使銀行資金呆滯，有失靈活，運用之效，且一年不爲短（丙）以房地產向銀行押款原爲上海銀行業之陋習，在現時情形之下，應予矯正，以免助長土地投機。</p>

<p>「本報訊」韓國代表團秘書長金恩忠，最近來華負責中韓聯絡事宜，日前曾赴京一行，返滬後於昨日下午二時招待本市新聞界，報告韓國近況，並強調中韓友好關係之重要。金氏首就韓國之歷史地理文化宗教風俗各方面申述與中國相關之處，繼分經濟，教育，政治三點，報告韓國現狀稱：（一）經濟情形相當混沌，因雅爾達會議協定以北　三十八度爲分界綫後，南北物資隔膜。據聞者一部份人生活不能解決，曾發生騷動。南部雖亦曾有流血事件，但一般情形較好。美軍當以物資米糧救濟，但人民仍反對託管，混望獨立。（二）教育方面自日本投降後，所有奴化教育已完全劃除。去年十二月起純正之文化已全部恢復。現時年輕之韓人維因生活於日人統治之下太久，而有不懂漢文者，但估計二千七百餘萬人口中百分之八十以上能講漢語。國內最通行之文字亦爲國漢文，即一部份漢文一部份韓文。現時教育制度亦與中國近似，學校中百分之九十八以上有漢文課程，且均係甚於對中國有瞭解有認識而自動教學。（三）政治問題並無如想像中之複雜。國內黨派雖多，但均能明瞭以求國學之獨立爲第一。南部獨立黨，民主黨，人民黨，共產黨等四大黨，最近已團結合作，成立共同黨部。獨立黨所主張之「政治教育經濟三均制度」已經四黨一致通過，並實施分田制。北部原有之人民委員會已改組爲新民黨，且亦實行分田制。所不用者南部對於則實行無條件收回而已。最近南北雙方已在開始聯緊，以共求國家之獨立自由。</p>
<p>最後金氏再三強調中韓應密切携手，渠稱，中韓兩國譬如總角之交，兩國祇有利害相關，絕無利害衝突之處。但因過去被日本長期佔領，少數勞民日久忘本，在中國爲非作歹，致生不良印象。戰事結束以來，中國對於韓僑韓俘與日僑日俘通風待遇，致有不少　正良民，亦被遣送回國，陷入困境。最近此間報戰韓國內有排華情形，因此開起中國若干地方人民對韓僑採取報復行動，此種情形對於中韓感情頗有不良影響。希望大家認清中韓友好關係之重要，少數劣民之行爲決不能代表全體，真正的韓國人都願做中國朋友。同時望中國政府對於良僑韓僑恩怨分別，並多予韓國已佔天時，蘇聯則佔地利，中國必須力求人和。最近韓國代表團已擬就具體改善中韓邦交辦法，建議中國政府：（一）對於東北二百餘萬韓僑農民予以貸款。（二）將　　韓僑財產尺度放寬。（三）縮短戰犯　理時期。（四）恢復中韓交通貿易等等。此外韓國內元老已在漢城立中韓親善協會以保護華僑云。</p>

<p>「本報訊」本市池浜路中華健康藥會，計劃於不久之將來恢復節育指導所，以爲受多盡之國或體力不勝之婦女謀福利。按戰前本市醫藥界有「上海節育研究社」之設立，戰爭期內因社員離散無形停頓。</p>
<p>據健康藥會主任醫師黃懷倍語記者稱：欲在中國普遍實施節育殆爲不可能之事，因節育一事，即在歐美進步之國，雖有不少人士提倡，亦不應節育也。至中國情形則因人民智識較低，往往家愈貧而兒女愈多，與之談節育，「對牛彈琴」之感。再者節育之法，無非應用工具，男性用者對於生理頗有不便，女性用者則價格昂貴，非貧家所能負擔。故該會雖擬恢復節育指導所，並無遠大之提倡計劃，僅爲對於若干生產過多或體力贏弱者作醫藥上之指導而已。</p>
<p>又中華健康藥會現已試辦「新聞公共衛生實驗區」，除辦理醫藥治療之實際門診工作外，並注重健康教育家庭訪視體格檢查等預防工作，其輸血服務部爲本市僅有之組織，現有特約輸血者七十二人，經常以血液供給上海十二所醫院，最近該會並將舉辦高級護士訓練班，每星期三下午則免費爲無病兒童檢查體格云。</p>

<p>繼由蔣夫人之代表，現任該團總經理鄧士萍介紹該國之作曲兼導演阿父夏洛穆夫，稱阿父先生（國中人對錒父夏洛穆夫之顧稱）幼時生長西伯利亞，因天然地理於中國境界想接近，　幼即酷愛中國音樂，立志發掘其實戰。渠之家長強其學醫，然阿父先生，甘願作家庭之叛徒，赴瑞士音樂院求深造。旋即來中國，卅年來，悉心研究國藥精粹。其作品已獲上演者，有「孟姜女」，「波光琴心」，「古刹鱉夢」，「五行星」等，尚未完成之作品，則有「婦　妃」，「鳳凰」等。</p>
<p>未由阿父夏洛穆致詞，稱三十年來，翰音樂工作，僅知以表達情感爲惟一目標。然此次承認夫人贊助後，始知本身之任務，優良之傳統，且造詣極高，與忍略，本人宗旨，即在於以中國國樂精粹，通過西洋樂器，使其發揮無遣。</p>
<p>中華音樂劇團定於十二月五六，七，八日，假南京犬戲院上演「孟姜女」。票價分五萬元（榮醫券），二萬元，及一萬元三種。按「孟姜女」一劇曾於「關心」演出，頗得一般人之好評，此次公演後，一有機會，即將赴美表演，爲救濟難童工作籌募經費。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕自本市房捐徵收新方法實施後，房主與房客即時起爭執，因現行之房捐徵收法，係按房租實際租金，百分之廿歸房主負担，先由住戶負責代繳，然後以之抵付租金。但房主與住戶問，往往於所訂租約上規定，捐稅悉歸承租人給付，與出租人無涉，以致住戶於繳捐後，常遭房主拒絕抵付，爭執即因是而起。財政局以此事涉及法律問題，曾函請上海地方法院予以明確解釋。頃悉地方法院已函復財政局，略請：出租人與承租人在租約內，訂有「一應捐稅悉歸承租人給付，與出租人無涉」者，雙方當事人自應受其拘束，但此種特約，並無對抗收稅機關之效力。</p>

保留着，我該多麼感謝喲。　　運河裏的小輪船公司也有好幾家，也都開短班，開行及到達馬頭的時間，也沒一定。　　邵伯殘破得不堪，河岸一帶，是昔日最熱鬧的地方，現在幾無人跡，找了幾十家纔吃到一頓飯，人民在極度窮困裏煮熬着。　　高郵是十月八日被國軍收復的，近來人口漸增，物價也逐漸高漲；東面是肥沃的田野，西面是湖，和實應一帶，都是「魚米之鄉」，可是這兩處遭受了八年倭奴之難，勝利之後，又罹中共之災，弄得十室十空，如今只剩下破濫的房屋和一遍荒地，給他們枯守着。　　淮安的城市，被敵機炸得斷瓦頹垣，不堪入目，中共佔據後，死亡的人數，難以統計，自九月二十一日國軍收復以來，流亡的人，歸來日衆，可是一般人都焦慮着怎樣活下去。　　淮陰是中共盤據蘇北的根據地，城市，公園，大橋都曾冠以葉挺若非等名字，人民所受的毒害，也倍於其他各縣，自十七年日本人來光顧以後，「和平軍」跟着來洗劫一番，後來又加上一個「八路」替閻王來催命，連年水旱又助紂爲虐，弄得淮陰人走頭無路，欲活不能！近經國軍收復，逃亡者均紛紛返里，可是在人口一方面因災禍而死亡的約計至少要有十分之三，被八路軍帶走的，亦佔很大的數字，現在一般農民，都缺乏耕牛，種籽，食糧和燃料等，目前大都穿着敗絮，吃着糟糠過日子。　　泗陽和宿遷，比較淮陰所受的災害稍輕，然而現在一方面要和生活奮鬥，一方面還受潛逸的八路軍驚擾，互相殘殺，甚不寗靖，每日清夜從沐陽傳來的砲聲，也足夠驚恐的。　　蘇北新收復區的還鄉隊，與地方上的良民，目前正自動的對着本鄉的中共幹部以及曾做中共爪牙的人，實施報復手段，被活埋的不知凡幾，幾日前每天總可以看見運河裏漂浮着幾十個死屍，流向長江裏去，還鄉隊亦有少數爲八路軍偷襲去的，這一筆人命賬也該記在中共的頭上。此外便是「物資復員」，先前被鄉里鄰居鬥爭去的土地，糧食，牲畜，房屋等，現在都自動的歸還給原主，糾葛正演鬧着。　　從這條帶子的南端走到北端以後，我們認爲目前的蘇北確有幾個嚴重的問題存在着，因爲上述這幾個地方的八路軍雖然爲國軍打退了，消滅了，但是國軍仍然不能解決這些地方人民的苦厄！我們僅根據實况，提出幾個問題和要求，以供當局去參考。　　（一）救濟　劫後餘生的蘇北人民所急盼救濟的（一）是食糧，因爲所有的食糧都被八路軍鬥光或帶走了。雖吃雜糧糠屑，亦難維持到舊歷年底。（二）是燃料，近幾年來，樹木被中共砍伐殆盡，又加連年歉收，樹根草根，亦將絕迹，行將難以熟食。（三）是棉花，走遍七百里途程，除了軍人和少數商人之外，未見有衣冠整齊的人，大都是破絮胎或百納襖，尤以淮陰一縣爲最糟，轉瞬嚴冬已屆，冰雪交加，若不急救，蘇北人民將何以活！（四）是種仔，蘇北人民食糧不夠，已是鐵的事實，大好田地，因缺乏麥種，只好眼看着放荒，今年不下種，又造成明年的飢饉了！（五）是耕牛，蘇北這幾年，牲畜也遭大殃，尤其是耕牛，頗難倖存，老百姓之缺乏耕牛和缺乏麥種一樣，徒然望着白地歎氣。（六）是醫藥，蘇北除了多年的黑熱症仍在猖獗外，復有身染雜症數年未加疹療者，很多人爲着生活，帶着病勞動着，其悲慘的情况，逈非他鄉人士所能想像得到的。　　（二）免徵免役　談到賦稅役政，這是政府的事，似不應由我們多嘴，不過我是深入蘇北民間的人，觀情察勢，纔有這種建議，蘇北的人民是富於情感的，國軍到了，政府辦公的人也來了，情願把僅有的食物拿出來歡迎慰勞，可是他們都是心有餘而力不足喲。所以我們要求：（一）要免賦，以减輕人民的負担　（二）要免役，這幾年老年人都爲窮困死了，青年人一部份被殘殺，一部份被帶走，剩下的衰弱貧病，若還挑選從役，則人口繁殖既成問題，大部土地只好放棄了！（三）要免供軍用柴糧，現在蘇北還要國軍繼續消减東部各縣共軍，還要國軍協助清鄉，免供軍用的平價柴糧，這句話，自顧不暇的蘇北人民不願說，不過蘇北地方實在供應不起，還請地方長官，請求軍事最高長官，下令軍事補給機關，速從別的地方設法來補救，以免加重蘇北人民的困難。　　（三）組訓民衆　中共在蘇北盤據好幾年　實行他的共產主義，練軍隊，辦學校，訓練民衆，施行毒化政策，一般無知的人民，多受他的　染，現在共軍雖然潰敗，而各地仍留下親共的份子不少，一遇機會，很容易釀成一種騷動，或發生一種力量，現今收復區內的民衆組織和訓練，是無庸忽視的，更要加强敎育　以糾正一般人的思想，俾中共將來對於道個老巢，無機可乘，以防這種浩劫的重演。　　末了，我們很希望政府，救濟總署和各報社派員合組一個考查團體，到蘇北新收復區去看一看，更請諸公看上帝的份上，指給蘇北人一條活命之路，千百萬的蘇北人在日夜盼禱着。長春之冬  十八日航訊　本報駐瀋記者趙展　　長春迎接冬天的兩大難題，是煤與水的問題，在冬季未來之前，燃料籌購有聲有色的做準備工作，一般市民的心目中，謀其政者是有辦法，不信煤會有問題，只有賣煤的小販順着煤價往高處爬，從十月份的流通卷一萬元一噸爬到十一月十日的兩萬元。　　煤　　十日長市聯合調度所及中長路局調度所發表了一個運煤的統計數字，自十一月三日首批煤車抵長，陸續運到了一百二十三車，計四千噸，一般人如大夢初醒，煤的謎底到底揭曉了，四千噸煤之中還是大半爲鐵路機車及機關的用煤，這消息無異於晴天霹靂，市民莫之所措了，長春是一個六十萬人口的都市，如照規定每人每日配給十公斤煤，則一天需要六百萬公斤，一個月需一萬萬八千萬公斤，區區四千噸煤，只夠市政府的大樓燒一個月水門汀之用的，於六十萬人之寒冷何益，於是羣情大譁，報紙上大喊「多煤發生嚴重問題」了。　　按東北各都市用煤統由物資調節委員會分配各國有煤礦供給量，須先付款後提煤，長春的冬煤，由西安烟台二礦供結，九月份訂購兩千噸，運到一千五百噸，到十二月底訂購一萬噸，西安烟台，二礦各分担五千噸，運輸辦法係出中長鐵路撥車皮一百八十輛，分爲四組，每組四十五輛，每日往返一次，每車載卅噸，每日可運到一百卅五噸，西安方面裝卸能力稍差，月僅可裝二十噸，以上是根據物資調節委員會長春分會的報告，一萬二千噸煤數量已經很微，不夠分配，又加運較成問題，便釀成長春嚴重的煤荒。此外按時交現款及分配問題，也是有力的因素，最重要的一點是燃料籌購機關缺去統盤計劃，到發生問題之後，急來把佛腳，有所遲了，西安烟台兩礦的存煤，足夠長春一帶的用量，煤荒是人爲的因素造成的。　　在「北滿」有大量的木材可燒，煤的需要還不十分嚴重，長春唯一取暖的材料則只有煤，榖糠和豆餅，將是煤的代用品，這是沒有辦法中的辦法，也祗有老百姓肯採用這種辦法。　　水　　在結冰期未到之前，水的威脅可不太大，不過水期就要來了。　　長春附近的地下水多涵淹於沙石層中，滲透不易，供給六十萬人口之需，頗感不裕，自從發現了引用伊通河流域三百十五方里或飲馬河流域三百七十方里之河水及伏流均可利用後，這一大水脈供給三百萬人口的都市也綽綽有餘，不過，今年的水用依然發生難題，趙君邁市長解釋缺水的原因謂：本年降雨量少，地表水量不足，加之四郊空屋太多，水管漏水量大，所以時鬧水荒，市府計劃實行給水站辦法，並謂：已動員人工修理引水機器，可由伊通河引得水來，在伊通河引水的能力未恢復之前，水源便成了問題。　　煤既然供給缺乏，都市的保暖便成了大問題，在結冰期間，市民無煤燃燒，上水道和下水道都有被凍結之憂，一家水管凍結，影響數家水源，水的問題越鬧越嚴重，當局有鑒及此，已擬定了一個水管保暖的辦法，全市民遵行，如實行得澈底，可以减少水的麻煩，惟保暖辦法是治標性質，而且市民沒有煤怎樣保暖還値得研究，水的問題依然是一個懸案。　　東北人的社會觀點很能適應日本人的經濟體制，過去日本人統治東北的辦法，是把東北人的生活固定在一個很可憐的水準上，在物質生活上呌東北人餓不死，凍不死，但絕不能超越這種半飢寒的生活水準，東北人習以爲常同時日本人的組織力很强，對東北人的生活必需品配給管制的非常嚴密，也不會呌東北人失去了可憐的生活水準的依恃，所以在東北人看來，生活苦一點不吃緊，如果感到缺乏的威脅，便是不合理的事。在偽滿時代，冬天不愁沒有煤燒，雖然不准中國人吃白米，高粱米總有得吃，光復後的第二個冬天，煤水及生活上的種種問題，使東北人搖頭嘆氣，以牢騷的口吻說：「偽滿時代如何……」這話給人以很大的刺激，是誰要東北人這樣講呢！地方花絮　存糧霉爛變空殼　公敎生涯只打油　　江西的糧政，逼死了程懋型，害苦了老百姓，但是現在靖安山地，還有戰時被徵　而倉儲的榖子一萬多石。放在那裏任其霉爛。靖安亦有近二千石的存糧爛到變成空殼。老百姓爲了應徵傷家敗產，縣大爺爲了霉榖的交代吃官司——靖安縣長王邦範，就是爲了霉榖，而新縣長毫不客氣的予以「冬防保護」。（本報駐南昌記者劉藻）　　樟樹交通銀行，最近一連接到七封恐嚇信，索款二千萬元，飛燈示警，措詞嚴厲，百般勒索，恐嚇信上說：「和平尙未絕望，絕不輕棄和平。」現在案情巳破，匪犯楊菊仙被捕入獄，自認勒索不諱。這是大都會的玩意，流入到古老的內地上演，由此可見生活的艱困與社會風氣的可怕，與其慶幸交行沒有受到二千萬的損失，不若注視這問題的嚴重。（本報駐南昌記者劉藻）　　贛省公敎人員的待遇，近月來因物價指數的增加，更是壓迫着薪水階級者的生活，省級公敎人員八九月份新調整的數額尙未補發，十一月又在鬧調整，這不過是給窮苦人們以無代價的興奮劑。事實上，省級財政萬分拮据，怎能趕得上一再的調整？負財政責任的當局，天天喊「吃不消」，公務人員陪着呌「沒辦法」。一首風行公敎人員間的打油詩：「調整待遇消息到，公敎人員哈哈笑，不意郵　把費加，柴米油鹽價又跳，冬衣破爛穿不得，兒女飢寒個個呌，有朝一日　津發，舊債還清又完了。」這正是窮苦人們的呼聲。（本報駐南昌記者劉藻）　　揚州在地勢上，雖爲蘇北與蘇南的跳板，或者說，雖是蘇北的「接腳石」，在「時宜」上，擺明了暫時營業很不佳。因此，偌大的「綠楊」，「中西」等旅社，每天祗賣出三五個房間，僅有的「新宴樓」「菜根香」「四五六」等大型菜館，顧客寡若晨星的現象，都是不足怪的了。而「困難反而增添」的原因是什麽呢？各商業繼補繳營業稅外，「所利得稅」又將要受起徵是也。人們明白：納稅是人民對國家應盡的義務，但是，在開支與收入已經兩不相抵的遭際下，開支再要加大，是一個問題了。本月份因實在「維持不了」而倒閉的正式商店，計有開設轅門橋頭達數十年之老店「大昌義茶葉號」等。然在另一面，美國軍用的剩餘物資「餐盒」，以及聽頭牛奶之類，在這兒的市面上倒還在大是傾銷！這是一個强烈的「盛衰」的對比啊！（本報揚州記者王公瀚）長沙市塲　在風雨飄搖中  廿日長沙航訊　本報特派員高元禮　　在全國普遍金融恐慌中，長沙市塲亦不能例外，物價高漲，購買力薄弱，商人在高利貸壓抑下生活着，僥倖的還能生存，先天不足的祗好倒閉，而且這種倒風蔓延到全省的幾個大城市，如長沙·湘潭·衡陽和常德，近月中的金融恐慌，頭寸不足的現象，更使一切的商業，都處在風雨飄搖之中，銀根一天天的趨緊。　　高利貸　高物價　　湖南本不是有名的商塲，戰前祗是輸出一些農　產品，換取日用的百貨，雖然交通便利，粤漢浙贛兩路橫貫全省，可是因爲湖南不是尾閭，一切均很落後，戰時的畸形現象，衡陽一躍而爲全國商業重鎭。川滇黔大後方的供應，都靠着衡陽，於是跑金華·溫州·走廣州·老隆，均以衡陽爲出發點，那時的湘桂鐵路，所輸送的單幫客，恐怕比現在京滬路更多些，可是一時繁榮，曇花一現，時過境遷，隨着勝利，湖南的商業地位，一落千丈。　　勝利以後，衡陽的商業地位，固然消失，省會長沙立即恢復原來的中心，商人都集結在長沙來圖恢復，可是長沙是一片焦土，開店營業的先決條件，是房屋，這在長沙是一件令人最頭痛的事。湖南商業資本並不多，能夠籌集一兩億的，已經很少，何况要將半數資金放在房屋上面，於是高利貸應運而生，據統計長沙商界兌到港滬購貨的款項，幾乎有一半是用高利貸借來，滬湘運輸不如何暢達，單程需時一二月，一萬元貸款，月需子金一千五百元，如何能讓物價平穩？　　六月底銀行結賬，長沙商塲曾發生一度風波，接連幾家商店倒閉，受拖累者不乏其人，甚至商業銀行亦受到一點小損失。幸而錢莊還多，雖然利息較銀行高，但還可維持，於是安穩渡過。　　外匯調整後，貨價扶搖直上。長沙商情全視上海爲轉移，跟着上海而爬高，有貨在手的高興萬分，可是忽略了購買力，價固然是漲了，可是有誰買得起呢？欠人的錢又到了期，貨又無人受。銀行方面，貸款是有限度的，國家銀行放款，各有專司，商業銀行，力量有限。中央銀行長沙分行主要業務，是代理國庫，重點現是不做的。而且近年來商業銀行放款，名義上是票據貼現，實際上是信用放款！因爲那些票據百分之百都是假的，眞做重貼現的話，事實上又不可能。至於抵押呢，因爲倉庫堆棧的缺乏，許多貨物堆存在本店裏，又如何能做抵押？由於這種種原因，於是長沙金融恐慌的風潮，日趨高漲，而波及各地。</p>

<p>出版界每星期四出版讀書的方法  傅統先　　最近有兩位「出版界」的讀者來信問我：在讀書的時候是先讀序跋，後讀本文好呢？還是先讀本文再看序跋好？以我個人的讀書習慣而論，我是喜歡先看序跋，後讀本文。而且有時常我初讀一本書而發現其中並沒有序或跋的時候，我往往會覺得這書裏缺少了某秤要素而感到不悅。　　作者寫序或作跋總是在本文完成之後。在他序裏面作者會吿訴我們他寫一本書的動機，寫書的時候所發生的感想和所發見的困難，有時作者還把全書的主題提綱　領的說明一下。因此，讀序的人可以從這種簡短的說明中看出作者的意向，情緒，以及他的主旨。假使讀者有了道個翰廓之後再讀本文，他可以在書中比較詳盡的討論中不致失去作者的中心思想。序言或跋往往有提高讀者對太書興趣的功用。我在拙譯考天卡：格式心理學原理的譯序裏面有過這樣一段話：　　「每在長途遊覽之後，我們喜歡告訴親友們沿途有多少的奇峰怪石，是怎樣的山靑水秀。所以有時讀遊記比看地圖有趣。常我看書的時候我喜歡先讀序，因爲它可以吿訴我一部著述在完全之前所經歷的一切。我以爲在我們研究一個地方的地理之前先讀一點關於道個地方的遊記，它可以使我對於道個地方發生親切的興趣。」　　不過祇見序文還不够，我們還應詳細的把目錄看一遍，這裏他可以得到全書的一個綱領，看出作者整個思想發展的程序和理路。有人不注意一本書的目錄，那末常他讀過本文之後往往會祇看見一顆一顆的樹而不知森林，每易祇見其一端而未能得視「全豹」。當然，假使有人祇看看一本書的綱目和序言而不讀本文內容，則此人必祇見森林而未見樹木！今日中國的幾張兒童報  庭　　辦一張兒童報紙，比辦一張成人報紙難多了。首先講到錢，錢是事業的基礎。可是現在社會上，有錢的人決不會看中以兒童作對象的報紙的。許多成人的報紙，或者比較容易找到所謂後台，因爲辦大報，對於出錢的人，有時多少總還希望做做事業的資本，小孩子却連吶喊都還嫌他們沒有力量。從現實的眼光來看，這種旣無名又無利的事情，除了傻子是不會來幹的。而一部分對於兒童敎育確有興趣的人，但我們可以說，大多數是窮的。因此，目前的兒童報紙，確實沒有一家不鬧窮，雖然現時的報業普遍都不景氣，兒童報紙則更甚。我常常這樣想，要兒童報紙辦得像樣，除了由國家來經營之外，實在很少有辦法。　　其次，再講到內容。兒童有兒童的天地，有他們的生活範圍，他和成人是截然不同的。成人所喜歡的，兒童或者不需要，反過來說，成人所不喜愛的事物，但在兒童或者竟視同拱璧。怎樣去和兒童的生活緊密地聯繫起來，這是編兒童報選材方面的第一個課題。我們在每一個較大的城市裏，都可以發現好多以出租神怪連環畫爲生的人，他們的生意非常發達，而他們的主顧却十九都是兒童，小朋友放學回家，路過這種小攤，一定是戀戀不捨的在翻着這些圖畫。從這一點上，我們很可以體味出兒童對於自己讀物選擇的興趣。第一，兒童是好奇的，道一些神怪奇離的故事，常常可以引他們入勝；第二，這一類木刻小人書，差不多有百分之九十是圖，只是用極少的文字，用來說明圖畫的意義，孩子們不定一定先看文字，他們也一定能够瞭解圖意。兒童的頭腦裏，並沒有「讀書」兩字的觀念。「遊戲和活動」才是他們的生活。　　所以辦一張兒童報紙，最要緊的是怎樣去設法使「死的文字，變成活的內容」，是怎樣去設法衝破「文字的障得」，使兒童不感到索然無趣，能够快樂地接受和消化。　　下面，我把幾種兒童的報紙，作一個簡單的介紹：　　「中國兒童時報」（社址：杭州　幼路，每期一百元）這是一張歷史最久的兒童報紙，民國十九年創刋於杭州，戰時會遷至金華，卅一年又遷到福建的永安，勝利後　杭。現在每五天出版四開報一張。因爲它有這樣長久的歷史，所以基礎比較穩固，令國廿七省有它的讀戶，目前的銷數是八千份。內容方面，第一版是時事報導。大的每期都有一兩方銅版照片，而對於敎育消息，尤特別注憲。第二版是補充敎材，各科都有，對於自然。算術·音樂·勞作四科的敎材，尤爲豐富。第三版是專刋比較長篇的文字，如童話·劇本·小說等，有一些插圖和連環故事畫。第四版則是兒童自己的作品。　　「兒童新聞」（社址：成都實騐小學，每期五十元）是內地唯一的一張比較像樣的兒意報，是）些小學敎師們辦的。因爲編輯的人，他們每天生活在兒童隊伍裏，所以材料最能配合敎科書。第一版的時事，不談大事，專載學校新聞，以及社會上一些兒童生活報吿，因此，很合兒童口胃。二·三·四三版用混合的編法，文章都極短，所以相當精，但是一個最大的缺點，就是內地材料的缺乏，一方面是紙張太差，其次是圖畫太少，雖有幾幅木刻，而又不十分好。目下發行數還不到二千份。如果他們在經濟上多少能够得到一點帮助，這張報是有前途的。　　「新少年報」（社址：上海大通路，旬刋，每期一百五十元）這是一張新辦的兒童報，現在還只出版了廿期，印刷和編排都很好看，裏面有不少長篇的東西，差不多整個第四版，都登載着一些未完的文章。兒童的作品，分量並不多。時事更少。它是兒童報裘面一張具有小報作風的報紙。開始的時候，有「哈哈信箱」，現在又有「咪咪信箱」裏面充滿着趣味。它的補充敎材比較少。所以很難得到敎師的歡迎，而且售價比較高，所以它很難跨出上海的門。　　「兒童之友」（社址：南昌，半月判，八開，每期五十元）這也才是今年五月裏才誕生的。我覺得兒童報紙，以八開的最好，兒童便於携帶，又便於裝訂。它的地方性比較重，內容不大肯跳出南昌的範圍，但我覺得這是它成功的地方。因爲創辦這報紙的人，他不想銷到外埠去，這樣，則內容方面，更可以適合當地兒童的需要。因爲物質的條件的不够，因此印刷和紙質都不很好。　　「兒童報」（社址：黃岩周刋，八開，每期一百元）這是一張暢銷於黃岩境內的報紙，由縣政府分發，差不多成了當地學生必讀的課外讀物。很少有一幅畫，文字也大部是向各兒童剪裁的。它的前途，我們很難預料。　　其次，湖南湘鄕還有一份旬報，浙江的永嘉有一份科學兒童，但因爲經費的關係，他們沒有定期。所以不再介紹了。　　（編者按：據編者所知，上海的正言報每週出版「兒童樂圍」副刋，又南京中央日報每週亦有兒童副刋，內容均甚精彩。）「工業華與農業建設」  雋之　　韓稼夫著　商務印書館出版　　神聖的民族生存底抗戰，把中國從半殖民地中提拔了起來；而走向獨立自由的列强道路上去，使廣大的五萬萬同胞，可在被壓迫者的地位，努力掙扎地得到了呼吸新鮮空氣的時代！　　我們試看，世界上每一個强盛的國家，都是工業化的國家；依賴着工業生產地發展，得使本國滋榮成長起來。很鮮明的例呈現在我們眼前，如美國，蘇聯它們都是以工業爲重心，美國尤以大址的生產物資運輸國外，獲利至巨，而使本身資本益發達。蘇聯現在是積極向着復興工業的計劃上猛進。雖然美蘇兩國因主義的不同的矛盾，展開着爭鬥，但，我們讀書界不偏於那一方，而明暸其衝突底矛盾，及其發展的途向，它們是都向着工業化上努力！農業方面，也由於工業的帮助，獲得很大的進步。　　我們再看看，中國的情形怎樣呢？言之慚愧，非但沒有向進步諸國學習它們底策略，而自己却有些倒退的危險；如高利貸和剩餘物資傾銷，壓倒了工業！這事實的危機，是有待於迅速改進，迅速改進更有待於自覺自發，自覺自發則依賴新知識的灌充——文化界的努力。　　中國向稱農業立國，但事實上，因工業之不濟，農業衰敗日益惡化；長此以往，危機暗礁越生越多，是很不好的現象。　　目前，國民經濟研究所，爲此問題，特有此種研究業書，來灌充大衆的知識，這一點是値得重視的；序言中，劉大鈞先生加以說明：　　「二十五年以前，筆者即主張我國必須工業化，並作文加以鼓吹；嗣後對此問題之研究與討論，未嘗或懈。在初國人多未加注意，然自抗戰軍興，工業化之需要乃深入人心，而政府且定爲國策焉。然一般論者，對於工業化，猶僅視爲工業本身之發展，而不知其他一切經濟事業，組織，以及政治，社會，文化等，在工業化時代中，亦與前此者逈異。……然工業化之涵義，固不專指工業一項，其影響所及，極爲普還，故研究此問題範圍頗爲廣泛。……」　　這一段話，更充分說明「工業化」之重要性；同時，政府已將其定爲國策，尤爲人民所樂聞，唯望其早日完成斯志，是才爲民衆所快！　　以上所述，並非故意累贅，乃我覺得必需要之說明，評介一書，這種討論是必要的；不然，成刻版式之嚴格紹語，又有何意？　　我們旣知「工業化」之重要，對於這問題之研究，更所注意，這册「工業化與中國農業建設」一書，可作我們讀書者研究的「開山斧」。　　本書「緒論」中提到：在工業化之途徑中，農業在國民經濟上之地位如何，農業對工業化之貢獻如何？工業化對於農業生產及農村社會之影響如何？均有待討論：　　此問題，作者明確地解決了：　　「就我國之自然資源以及國民在歷史上所獲得之經騐埤智而論，我國迄未失其爲農業國家。故我國之實現工業化也，舉凡勞力，資本，市塲，原料，莫不仰給於農業社會，是則工業化者，蓋不啻中國整個文化之改革耳。」這一改革之是否甫要呢？「社會之演進，由農業時代而進入工商業時代，良以農業本身之性質未足以適應經濟發展之需要。蓋農業以土地爲基礎，其經營之限度，恒受地力之限制，非若工業之僅利用土地之積載力者；農業所受自然環境之支配亦鉅，和風甘雨年慶有秋殊不多覯，良田沃壞均不免於旱潦霜雪風電病蟲之災，非若工業生產之易於馭用。　　天然力，適應環境，富於韌性。而工業生產，基於資本及勞力，集中財富，效率益增。…」　　由此，可知現代國家之所以藉工業化發展國民經濟，與提高文化水準，乃爲現代國家在生存競爭中，所必趨之途徑。　　眼前的中國，正在「列强」隊伍裏作生存之競爭，則需觀自己的能否走上這生存的途徑。　　誠然而，中國要走上工業化，必藉農業以樹立工業，猶之蘇聯及美國，在極高度工業化進展之中，農業生產亦不偏廢。而且中國地形，廣大之沃原，更需由農業來推動工業化之促成！　　這本書，就是研究「農業建設」中，實現中國工業化。作者說明：　　一，我國之農業資源：農業生產之自然環境，我國之農業區域，農業人口，朮要農產量及分佈，農產品在國際貿易之地位。　　二，農業現狀方面：小規模之生產，耕者無其田之嚴重性，農村高利貸之活躍，農業勞動力效能之低微，農業經營方式之單純。各方面均以說明，及其補救辦法。並述畜牧之落後，森林摧毀及災荒。　　三，工業化的農業建設：農業技術之科學化，農塲作業之機械化與電氣化，農產品之商品化；以及農業組織之現代化，農地使用之合理化，農業經營之資本化。　　四，農村工業化：說明其意義，型態範圍，並較之農村工業與都市工業。　　五，現代工業對農業發展之影響：肥料與農具之改進，農產品之改進及其用途之推廣　　六，工業化的農業改進方針：農業生產之調整，農業機械化，資本化以及農產商品化，農村工業化之實現。　　以上六點，乃縮本書的大部內容，其對於農業建設之工業化各部份，無不論到，並指出工業化的農業改進方針，循此而行，必漸得成果！　　義們知道：落後的農業生產，必需改進，這是中國經濟建設必走之路；發展農業的基本條件，必由工業化來適應。因之「農業工業化」是有其重大的重要性　　作者最後也設明：「今後農業政策之取捨，應顧及國民經濟建設趨重「工業化」之大前提，並與其他工業政策取得聯絡，相輔爲用，方能發揮其效益也。」希望祖國實施此政而强盛起來！更望諸君爲國家之改進，同讚此書！　　韓文恢復固有地位  合衆社暴日戰敗後，韓文方能用於朝鮮公牘；圖示韓國出版協會主席金氏在美國出示其韓文護照。介紹一本地圖  張永曾　　「新中國分省圖」王成組盧村禾合編　新中國出版社　卅五年九月初版　　地圖不但是地理敎學上重要的工具，同時也是一般人參考所必需的。自後太平洋戰爭爆發之後，地圖出版事業就停頓了。抗戰勝利，忽忽又是一年，許多失地收復了，主權收回了，疆域增廣，國界擴張，舊日的地圖自然不能適應建國的需要。　　在一般人都惑到地圖荒的時候，新中國出版社新出版了一種「新中國分省圖」，確是一大貢獻。編纂者爲王成組盧村禾兩敎授，均係國內知名的地理學家。這册地圖專爲供應中等學校本國地理敎學之用，並適合一般人士的需要，取材係根據敎育部頒定「修正高初級中學課程標準」。　　這册地岡，於自然與人天，兼籌並顧，可說是一大特點。首列地球面及世界列國圖，次列全國總圖，以表明地形·政區·氣候·土壞·人口·語言·產業·交通·建國方略等項，然後分列各省圖，並附重要都市和重要地區的插岡，使我們看了可以明暸全國各省的自然形勢和文化情形。　　爲了加强讀者獲得對於各地形勢的了解，各省分圖，都按地形高度分層設色。所列地名，除重要都市及縣治外，凡重要市鎭及邊疆設治局等，都有記　，所以就地名說，比任何地圖都完備。　　分省　大抵每省一幅，只有最近劃分的東北九省及甘肅。寗夏·靑海三省各合刋於一雙幅。熱河·察哈爾·緩遠三省合成一幅，繁簡得宜，構圖淸晰，可以看出編纂者工作的認眞審愼。　　台灣隨抗戰勝利而收回，對於這個新創的省區，該是全國人民所亟欲知道的。我想這册地圖把合灣另立一幅，確是具有特殊的意義的。還有，外蒙古人民共和國原係我國的領土，它的得失影響我國前途至大，今雖依照「中蘇協定」准其獨立，但手續仍不完備，只要我國能發奮圖强，還是可以重回我國的版圖的。本圖把外蒙古共和國附列出來，也是含有深意的。　　關於說明，我覺得本圖所記戲的很够得上稱詳實扼要，讀者可以由此得到基本的地理常識。而各項統計數字，都係按照我國新疆域計算，當然準確。　　在貧乏的戰後地圖出版界，這册「新中國分省圖」的編篡，確是今日所迫切需要的。我們雖不能說它已做到盡善盡美的地步，但作爲中等學校敎學及一般參考之用，眞是再適合也沒有了。因爲它的取材新穎，編製簡明，很切合實用。內中文字說明的一部份，可採作補充敎材，因爲現行通用的地理敎本，有許多新材料還沒有被採入，這册地岡正可以彌補這缺點。約翰·克利斯朶夫（上）  葭水　羅曼羅蘭著　傅雷譯　駱駝書店版　　獻給全世界受苦，奮鬥，終必戰勝的，自由靈魂。　　江聲浩蕩。在萊菌河畔的一個父子相傳以音樂爲業的貧窮家庭中，約翰。克利斯朶夫誕生了。父親曼希沃相當漂亮，原可以希岡一門富室婚事，却莫名其妙的，娶了又窮又醜又無敎育的廚娛魯意莎爲妻，因而感到屈辱，沉湎於酒。由於祖父約翰·米希爾的鼓勵克利斯朶夫學琴，也在作曲。音樂好似一顆流落在黝黯的天空的明星般，開始射出照耀他一生的光明。他見到了大音樂家哈斯萊，得到了將來帮助他的應許。父親把他的作品題獻與大公爵，並開了一次音樂會。觀衆樂了，大鼓掌，但克利斯朶夫只感到被玩弄了的悲哀。　　他在宮廷音樂聯合會爲助手，開始掙錢。祖父死了，家庭破產，十四歲的孩子負了扶養全家的責任。他與富商之子奧多爲友，因這友誼超越了普通限度而被嘲笑。他愛上了女學生彌娜；因爲身份階級不相稱，被她母親，一位參議官的新寡夫人，拆散了。他想自殺，想殺人。在這苦惱之後，他的意年吿終了。他父親被發現在小溝裏流死。他看到人生是一塲沒有休息沒有僥倖的戰鬥　　他的弟弟們離開家庭。爲了還父親所遺的債，他和母親遷到較便宜的居處。房東是祖父的朋友老書記于萊。愛的慾望在靑春的身心中蘇醒。于萊的外孫女兒洛莎愛他，他却愛上一個鄰居，二十歲的新寡少婦薩皮納。但在他們未曾說出他們的愛情以先，蕯皮納死了，他只好把她的影子藏在心　深處。他和女店員阿達同居，却終於受不住她那不可救藥的卑下天性，而把她撇開了。他開始喝酒，幸得他好舅父，善良的高脫弗烈特以他父親的墮落提醒他，使他覺悟。　　他擺脫了情欲之網，他創造，意識到自己簇新的精力。他對一切加以批評，他看到了德國人的矯偽。他多方樹敵，終於得罪了大公爵，失了靠山。他的一切出路都已斷絕，用自己積蓄所印行的作品又在六個月中未會賣去一部，不得已只好當一種不愜意的敎師生活以謀生。他學校中生物敎員萊哈脫夫婦有愉快的友誼，謠言却說他是萊哈脫太太的情夫。他眞正的孤獨了，母親不了解他，舅父也在遠地去世，他想到了童年會見的大音樂家哈斯萊，老遠的跑去看他，却只受到極冷淡的接待。幸而在回家的路上，到一個崇拜他的老人蘇茲那裏逗留了一天，纔使他的心境重新光明。在另一地地碰到了舅父逝世時所住處的一家人，和舅父的墳。故鄉不復能使他滿足，他要到法國去，但母親不放。終於爲了鄉下姑娘洛金，得罪了兵士，遭到通緝，匆匆的逃往法國。　　初到法國，他只認識兩個人，童年的友人奧多和猶太人高恩。奧多對他表現鄙吝，使他當面駡奧多是豬。高恩對他也僅略勝於敷衍。他喜歡女學生高蘭德，但她只知賣弄風情。她的十三歲表妹葛拉齊亞對他深有好感，他却全未覺察，不久葛拉齊亞回意大利去了。他窮到一天只能吃一餐，終於只好到他所前曾拒絕，高恩所介紹的開音樂舖的哀區脫那裏去，爲他編譜。有一天，在餓昏了的搖搖恍恍之中，他忽然見到在對街有一位女子，是他在德國時曾於無心中敲破了她飯碗的　國女敎員，一位靜婉的女郞，他所不能忘却的。他趕過去，在無數車輛中險些撞死，好容易走過對街時，她已不見了。後來，在一個音樂會裏，他見到一位靑年法國詩人，是很崇拜他的，奧里維。耶南。這使他自覺有了一個朋友。　　他們合租一間寓所。『能在世上有一知己』的感覺，使他們有深切而無聲的吹琴。克利斯朶夫發現奧里維的姊姊，就是他所念念不忘的法國女敎員安多納德，而且她對克利斯朶夫，雖然見面的次數很少，却對他有純潔而深刻的感情，正如他對她一樣。可惜的是，她與奧里維是無父母的孤兒，在她爲奧里維作了許多犧牲之後，已在不久之前去世了。他們都被那聖潔的女郞的靈魂所包裹了。這時，克利斯朶夫的『大衛』出版了，立刻在國外得到成功，但這成功對於他們的物質生活沒有多大的帮助。他收到母親一信，說身體不好。他偷偷的趕回去，送了母親的終。　　回到法國，他被某一報紙『製造』，又被別的報紙攻擊。這時，奧里維愛上了一位工程師的女兒，雅葛麗納和她結了婚。克利斯朶夫與女演員法朗梭阿士同居；但她是個抑鬱的人，所以當她被聘到美國演戲時，他們毅然分離了。奧里維却與雅葛麗納因誤會而生隔膜，終於她丟了丈夫兒子與別人私奔。法朗梭阿士在美國病歿。克利斯朶夫發現在他備受攻擊時對他表同情因而使輿論好轉的裴萊尼伯爵夫婦，原來就是他以前所未留心的葛拉齊亞和她的丈夫。他發現自己愛她，但她對他只有一揮恬靜的友誼。　　和奧里維同住的一個工人，因不堪貧病的壓迫，和妻子與五個兒女一起自殺了。這事激動了奧里維；他和克利斯朶夫開始關心被壓迫者的生活。五一節，羣衆與憲兵在街上衝突。爲了救援他的小友，老靴匠的孫子，十三歲的愛麥虞限，粵里維竟犧牲了自己的性命。克利斯朶夫到瑞士，在同國友人勃羅姆醫生那裏，慢慢的治療他喪友的創傷。在身心失常的狀態中，他和勃羅姆之妻有了不正當的關係。他逃出，到山上居住。他心靈枯萎了。後來又活了，一種無名的威力驅策着他工作，日復一日，週復一週。隨後，一切停止。他老了十歲，一簇白髮突然顯現。　　生命飛逝。但他的生命是在別處；它是沒有歷史的，它的歷史是他創造的作品。他勝利了；他的名字照臨一切。德國，法國，都歡迎他，但他怕那些地方的回憶，他住在瑞士。他重見葛拉齊亞，已是寡婦，有一子一女。他回到巴黎指揮一組音樂會。見到愛麥虞限，已是個靑年詩人；又見到奧里維之子子喬。葛拉齊亞也來了。但她那患肺病的兒子嫉妒他們，使他們的友誼不能更進一步。兒子死了，不久葛拉齊亞自己也死了。但他已越過了火錢，很快的他就回到人生的行列中去。葛拉齊亞的女兒和喬治相愛，使他十分快樂。在他們結婚時，他病了，混身發燒，滿着幻夢。他整個的生涯在他眼前流着，有如萊茵。……噢，歡樂，眼見自己在上帝至高的和平中消滅，眼見終身曾經盡力效勞，眞是何等的歡樂！……　　聖者克利斯朶夫渡過了河。他終夜在逆流中走着，左肩上頂着一個嬌弱而沉重的孩子。天又黎明，快要顚撲的克利斯朶夫，終於達到了彼岸。於是他對孩子說：　　——我們終究到了！你多沉重！孩子，你究竟是誰啊？　　孩子答道：　　——我是即將來到的日子</p>

<p>春秋小巧玲瓏記蘇州  趙淸閣　　杭州歸來居然又遊了一次蘇州。這完全是表姊的力量，她約了我許多次，我也答應了許多次，像欠了筆債一樣，直拖到一年後才算償還了。可是來去匆匆，反從然增加些被此的惆悵。　　闊別蘇州十二秋，今日舊地重臨，腦海中僅保留着斑斑模糊的夢痕！努力的追憶，也只能從一些風景名勝的殘餘印象裏，依稀記起當時的情調而已。　　出　門到留園，這裏是一片蒼凉滿園荒！樓台亭榭破爛不堪，和我在杭州看到劉荘的情形差不多。我真奇怪，像這種旣已劃作公衆遊覺的風景區域，爲什麽政府會亳不注意，而加修理一番，難道是吝借這點兒修理費嗎？不懂　　從留園到虎丘，是一條黃泥鋪成的路，寬大却不平坦，坐在輸子沒有皮胎，塾子授府棉心的人力車上，一步一顚，顚得你屁股痛。及抵山門，爬了還沒有重慶張家花園一半的坡，就到了所謂山頂。山頂有碑築的虎丘塔，遠看倒挺美麗，近瞧，簡直是廢墟中的一堆泥。山下一溪清流，呌做﹁劍池﹂。旁有﹁點頭石﹂等古蹟，傳說曾有一位和尚在這裏講經、結果連一羣頑石都傾服得點了頭。因偽我喜歡這段故事、所以十二年前我還利這羣頑石合過影。這次我又在這裏拍了照片。我希望有一天我也會在這裏發現一種偉大的醒世的道、讓我這顆頑石也能傾服地點了頭！　　離開虎丘的時候，我一步一回首、我懷着異常茫然的心情，像是在尋找曾經消失的足跡，又像是在逐步攝取記憶。偶然伏身　起幾片剛剛驟落的紅葉，我的　幾立刻　染到一股熱，－股血　弈　的　！我吻着紅葉，悄悄說了聲再見！　　一個暮色蒼茫的黃昏，我品嘗　　十林。將全蘇州的風景區　　最　歡獅子林，這裏雖然也　　　　失修似的痕跡，但還比　　　。看得出當時設計這園景的工程師，有着很高的文藝修養。無論是一株樹；一塊石；一架　；一座亭台；一排粉堰；都配　　那麽精緻典雅，小巧玲瓏，　　的情調，有詩的意境。有首一　偏院裏翠竹成蔭，環以短籬　秋風吹着落葉打在窗玻璃上，　　作聲，似啜泣又似嘆息！於是我幻想這獅子林就是大觀園的　　館。我蕁覓那捲簾上的鸚鵡籠子；我　訪那埋葬着幾易春秋的落英集成的花塚；我仿佛隱隱聽見有古琴的斷弦聲；有沉吟聲；有嗆咳聲；亦有唏噓聲！但是我看不見這許多聲音來源的一絲跡象，只看見月光裏竹影搖拽！我不禁感到人亡樓空的悲悽！步出滲溪的瀟湘深處，踱過曲橋，伏視池塘裏殘荷萎莖，目睹一隻隻水鷗飛來復飛去，無限滄桑漣漪，盪漾在生命的源泉裏，我黯然了！這時，兀地一羣遊客嘻笑着白石造的畫舫上跳躍而出，驚醒了我的神智。我定睛眺望了一下雲天，原來我先前一度離開了現實的境界，如今，我又回來了，我的精神有些眩惑！　　第二天的早晨，驅車到抽政園。淪陷時期爲敵偽的省政府址，現在是社會教育學院所接收。當即訪候執教該院的谷劍康先生，別經十載，老友已經兩鬢斑向了！殘酷的戰爭糟踐了侮個人。承劍陣導引我參觀了全園的景物。地方確比獅子林大一倍，也整潔得多。或許因爲牠曾被一羣狗的足跡沾辱過吧，我不太感到興趣。同時人衆嘈雜，破壞了幽雅的情調。倒是幾聲繼續的綱琴聲，和着掠空飛過的鳥語，還能使我略微嗅到些大自然的氣息！　　走出抽政園本想再到滄浪亭，寒山寺看看，可是聽說滄浪亭爲蘇州藝專的校址，謝絕參觀，並且也荒蕪得厲害。至於寒山寺，更慘！日寇把廟裏的古鐘盜走了，這樣就大煞風景，去了反倒增加一腔憤滿，不去也罷。於是便在城內逛玄妙觀，巡禮蘇州的市容。　　玄妙觀像開封的相國寺，上海城隍廟。裏面有賣小吃的；有賣雜　玩　　的；有賣卜的；也有賣花草鳥雀的。大殿內還有許多民族形式的字畫店，滿牆壁上抖着紅红綠綠的條幅，畫的儘是流傳民間的故事，或神像，仕女，娃娃。記得我小的時候，要過年了，父親就買了這些娃娃畫兒掛在我的床頭。這類畫的銷路平常很少人問津，只有過年才特別的興隆。如今因爲快到春節了，所以每家畫店正忙着趕出品。畫師從十二三歲到六七十歲，有生　瘡的，有一雙眼的，看來都很貧苦，靠了一枝機械猫舉的筆，掙飯吃，本不是容易的。這些畫師雖然沒在什麽知識，但他們的心很善良，他們取材於忠孝節義的歷史掌故，他們所收穫的敎育效果，並不在一般「專家」「大師」之下！然而，他們却只能蜷伏在不被注意的陰暗的古廟裏，他們沒有榮幸承受社會的禮遇，因爲他們是羣登不得「大雅之堂」的小人物！　　玄妙觀前就是蘇州最熱閙的街市。一家最龐大的茶館叫吳苑，一家最幽雅的茶館叫怡園。據聞當地悠閒的人士，多整天消磨在這裏，無論是谈生意，談變愛，都很適宜。這種風俗習氣，和成都非常相似。我愛這種風俗習氣，所以我愛成都，也愛蘇州，假如有一天我有資格休息休息了，那我一定到這種地方來住上一年半載，甚取永久住下去。　　臨行的前一小時，我還和表姊等在一家潔凈雅緻的小酒館特　暢飲。有名的淸水蟹，肥碩而味美。與故人對酌談心，眞有不醉無歸之感！　　終於我又倉促地離開了蘇州，但這次她給了我較深刻的印象，回到上海，我還念念不忘蘇州的精緻儒雅，蘇州的小巧玲瓏！（卅五年十一月廿日黃昏滬濱）詩談片  林風　　有人說：「詩人是語言的魔術師。」我說詩人是眞理的發現者。寫詩不單是憑靈感；切實體騐活潑的生活會發現更多詩的素材。古典的詩人爲歌頌而寫詩，現代的詩人爲創造而寫詩：人們藉他的聲音走向前去，得知那些地方是陷阱深淵，那些地方值得人逡巡留戀還鄉詩記  呂白華　　天竺半日　　「水光　　晴方好，山色空驟雨亦奇」，從東坡散了這兩句詩以後，西湖在後人眼底　成了淡妝濃抺無時不好的抽象美人了。但無時不好却忽略了夜間，我以爲夜泛西湖更比晴雨來得好。於是夜以繼日，和　凖買一綽重遊，雙槳打着夜的湖面，因爲沒有月，我們穿過　橋，船挨着荷葉徐　，尤其一種雅靜恬似平超然嚷外之感。　　第二天，一早　　就跑了來，他請假半日，要陪我天竺去，友情的溫暖，使疲頹的旅心興奮了。由湖濱到殼隱，每隔數分鐘，就有公共汽車的，車駛過湖堤，跟山路的陡峭升高起來，萬絲濕襟，淸虛在抱，這在上海是　觸不到的。靈隱的勝處在山門前一帶亂峯，號「飛來峯」。從前曲園老人常流連在這兒，因爲飛來峯下有冷泉，把「泉自幾時冷起，山從何處飛來」，巧對着：「泉自冷時冷起，山從飛處飛來」。按飛來峯本來呌靈鷲峯：「晋时西僧葉理登此山，嘆曰，此是天竺国靈鷲山之小嶺，不知何年飛來」？看那亂峯　疊中間，鐫刻着許多佛像，喧　的水聲從峯脚嚮過，的確很可觀。我們走入了一小洞，一個和尙立起來，拿竹桿指向上面對我們說，「廻是一綫天」！說了，伸出手要我們助點綠，等於沿街的乞兒，雖未免可憐，而不禁爲名山呌屈。　　山門外一長排放着竹輿，那是上高岩的生意，我們折向天竺去，輿夫討價很兇，咬定八千元，綠凖告訴我，誼州人這一樣最壞，他們明是「爆黃瓜兒」的。我們還他三千，當然不肯但是等走去了一程跟一程，竟然跟上了半山，招着手意思是成交了，彝凖生了氣，索性不坐，橫豎沒有多路就是下天竺了。再上去，寫着「中天竺國」，這四字頗維渾，我們進了殿，一個掛單僧和我們談了許久，提起弘一法師，說誰得經如　觀，却也並不　妄的。我在夏丐尊光生處看見過弘一的字，又看見過弘一爲夏丐尊造的象，弘一法師是中國唯一的高僧，可惜相遇　疏，這掛單僧能够留心他的事迹，也可以說不俗了。　　再上去是上天竺，供着圓通大土，「圓通」也者，倒給我們做人的一個啓示，佛門分「正法」「圓通」兩名詞，似乎在「断文涅」裏這樣討論過正法眼藏是不能鄙棄圓通的。三天竺的相距爲一條直上的山蹬，畢竟不是西方的天竺，只點綴了三座廟貌，論風景遠不及靈隱，不過就在這一條直上的山磴，蜿蜒地，很有意味，的確是「三面阻山，中路直關，若兩谷然」。　　忽然滿山瀉下了大雨，我們就匆匆離開函谷式的三竺。　　飛來峯下莊嚴相，　　衰草於今半蝕凋；　　合乎瞿　窮作乞，　　石間懸聲當吳簫！　　中天竺國掛單僧，　　能道前師弘一名；　　悟到傎如便飛錫，　　傳經十指血書成。　　老丹聲明　　月之廿五日，本刋發表「從性心理談藹理斯」一文，原爲去夏在渝寫成，倉卒間以藹理斯與哈理斯，並爲一談，亦未另列標趨。茲始察覺，謹向讀者致歉，並彰吾過，老丹誌。一寸山河一寸血　106  葉勁風　　﹁大哥，交際塲上的繁文褥節，我們剛才己經表演過了，你太應當再跟我過分客氣了……」萍子扳正了頗色，閃爍蕭兩顆亮晶晶的眼珠，啡着鶴見。說她扳正了顏色，那也不然。像萍子這樣的嬌媚欲滴、那而色的表情上，除了笑，只有哭，這樣兩種。而且，除了哭得極度傷心，握住了臉，看不見神色，那才算是笑以外的表情，否則即使她生氣，發怒，惱恨，憂傷，甚至於戟指矯叱，在駡至着的當口，那眼眉嘴角之間，總似乎念着些微笑意。試想，正如舊小豁上的「杏眼」，「柳眉」，「桃腮」，「荚蓉面」，等等，這擞的输廓和佈局，只要閉目存想一下，就可想到，這是一種天然含有蜜蜜笑意的神情，如何能够惡顔厲色得起來？　　所以這裏說萍子扳正了颜色，也祇是收起了一些笑意而已，奇怪的是，在鹤見離關了這短短幾分穜之中，　子的態度忽地燮了，口氛也換了；好好的鶴見先生，鶴見君，一燮而爲大哥，這種旣非两洋化，又非東洋本色的稱呼，倒是有些「支那」半親半江湖腔調，從什麽地方跳出來的？其中藏着甚麼啞謎呢？鶴見聽了這突然改變作風的口氣，當然也要免不了一驚。　　「野猪當然把他打聽到的话，關於我的事，都報告過了」。她又恢復了原來的頑皮，悄悄的笑着；表示鶴見剛才的動作，都在她的明察之中，她看見鶴見外表似乎也莫名其妙，陪着在笑，心上大概此較挨了一颗砲彈，還要震動得厲害，却又有些不忍，立刻停止了笑聲；　　「大哥，你用不着奇怪」，她放輕了聲音，挨近了鶴見一些，似乎在同他耳語似的，「家父和令尊、這幾年走得很近，大概大哥還不大知道吧。他們俩老一輩，親密得跟弟兄一般，所以我稱你大哥，大概不算太高攀了，不是嗎？」　鶴見總算在驚濤駭浪裏打過翻身的人，所以萍子這們接二連三的幾次商峯變化，一下比一下驚人，他還勉强支持，還能不變神色；打定主意，看她的壓軸戲究竟是什麼．　　「大哥，你在大陸行動總部的工作，那麼活躍，我每次在報紙上看見，又聽得兩位老人酒後茶餘，對於你種種的評論，我是不勝欽佩的，只可恨我自己這邊，也有職務，脫不了身，不然的話，我一定要到大陸上來，哪怕聽候差遣呢，我也總興榮幸的，……不過……」！　　「誇獎……太過分誇獎了，不過……」？鶴見急於要聽她的下文，不願再　　不去。　　「是……」！萍子似乎完全明瞭鶴見的意思，所以趕緊援了下文，「不過照總部立塲，大哥的一切，當然正合於他們的理想。可是家父同令尊方面，却有另外一種見解：他們認爲大哥走到歧路上去了。至於怎樣算是走的歧路，我一時還說不明白。這一點，是要請大哥諒的」。小記魯彦  黎錦明　　魯彥，浙江戴海人，有人說他是作家中屬於此較穩键的一個。他爲了某一篇創作，二七年來到長沙，始終不肯在長沙市上逗留一　時候。他甘願住在水陸洲一幢民房的小楼上，每天到沙灘邊會朋友；有時，精神不安定她說：　　「住水陸洲還不可以麽？未必水陛洲就完全由長沙管轄？」　　卅一年，他在桂林編文藝雜誌，並不意識到那個非尋常的時代。他顯意籍此創一個小小樂園，拉幾個朋友，共同到這伊甸花園內享那天天在鬧驚慌的桃源之夢。雖然如此，有　人畢竟指摘他不顧全忠實。說他畏葸，想和侵略者妥協。他便在一篇小說内，大聲疾呼說：　　「我是這樣的人麼——和侵略者妥協……我最反對他们，最反對他們—」　　他的作品很少受有潮流影嚮的。他從世界着　譯過來的芬　，捷克，新希臘，新猶太，保加利亞……那　短　的作品中體騐一種適中的人生觀感，以他的市民生活意味，溶化在自己的藝術當中、倒非常能引起一些社會政治意忿较深的人們的器識。他和H．G．威爾斯一樣，是一位「粗筆」作家，文章似乎不講求潤色的。他有　兒瞧不起創作；「寫下來就是，何必收！」他曾有一次，對人這般感慨的說。　　但魯彥先生在文藝界所留下的優好成績，而是那#在民十六七年間所譯的短篇小說·亭利克，顯克微支的老僕人，泉邊，……像存了充份的體裁上的優美，他爲了人們交口讚譽，卅二年曾在桂林收集了它，重印了出來。他将這個贈給去訪問他的友人，……這時他已病痔了，整日躺在桂林西北睡一間小樓的床上。　　友人們愛魯彦的畢竟多，都感讚他自始至終爲文藝犧牲。他不踢打他所處的環境。牠時常對人說：　　「我寫作，從愛羅先河學世界語，都由於自身的努力。　的家境不十分好，爲的求節儉，我少年時受家主

<h3 id="e1">Chairman Submits Draft Constitution This Morning; Solemnly Delivered to the National Assembly for Discussion; Foreign Guests Invited to Attend the Ceremony <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 27th] Representative Chiang Chung-cheng will, at 9:00 AM on the 28th, attend the Third Session of the National Assembly in his capacity as Chairman of the National Government. With an extremely solemn ceremony, he will submit the Draft Constitution of the Republic of China for discussion by the assembly, and address all representatives on the drafting process of the constitutional draft. This event will be the harbinger of our nation's democratic politics, the beginning of returning power to the people. Therefore, Chairman Chiang will attend the meeting on the 28th in full military regalia, wearing his decorations. Music will be played during the submission ceremony, and foreign guests will also be present. This is truly a grand inauguration ceremony for our constitutional government. In addition to the above ceremony and Chairman Chiang's report, the Third Session will include a report from the Secretariat on the minutes of the previous meeting, as well as congratulatory messages and customary greetings. When the assembly continues in the afternoon, Sun Ke will report. Discussion of the constitutional draft will begin on the 28th. Furthermore, representative seating will remain the same on the 28th, and will follow the newly drawn seating chart from the 29th onwards. Also, the seats reserved for the Communist Party and the Democratic League will be retained, awaiting their participation at any time, demonstrating the government's attitude of magnanimity. These new seating charts have already been printed and will be distributed to all representatives and reporters for their use in the afternoon of the 28th.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 27th] The Presidium of the National Assembly held its Sixth Meeting at 10:00 AM on the 27th. Attendees included Chiang Chung-cheng, Zuo Shunsheng, Chen Qitian, and Liu Hengjing, among others. Zou Lu chaired the meeting, and the following resolutions were passed: A. The Representative Qualification Review Committee will be composed of the following three parts: (1) Conveners of the candidates recommended by each unit to the Presidium; (2) Those who received the next highest number of votes for the candidates recommended by each unit to the Presidium; (3) Representative Zhang Lisheng, Director of the National Assembly Representative Election Headquarters. The above personnel will serve as committee members and will be convened by Representative Zhang Lisheng. B. Regarding the procedure for the assembly's discussion of the constitutional draft, it was decided that Chairman Chiang of the National Government will submit the Draft Constitution of the Republic of China to the assembly. The discussion procedure will first involve a general debate, followed by chapter-by-chapter review. C. The original plan was to nominate Representative Chiang Chung-cheng as Chairman of the Third Session, but now Representative Hu Shi has been nominated instead.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 27th] In addition to Hu Shi, the Presidium of the Third Session of the National Assembly on the 28th will include Zeng Qi, Bai Chongxi, Chen Guofu, Zhu Jingnong, Hu Shuhua, He Chengjün, Liang Hancao, Huang Yünsu, Duan Xipeng, and Xu Fulin, from the Third Group.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 27th] Seven National Assembly representatives registered on the 27th: two regional representatives, two occupational representatives, the social notable Yan Yangchu, Tao Xisheng, directly selected by the National Government, and Kuai Chao of the Social Democratic Party. Including the previous registrations, the total number of registered representatives is 1,623. The National Government announced 1,744 representatives, leaving 121 yet to register. Furthermore, the National Assembly staff badges and entry passes will be reissued again. Temporary entry passes will be issued first on the morning of the 28th, and the new passes will be used from the 29th.</p>
<h3 id="e2">Amending the Draft Constitution at the National Assembly; All Based on the Resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference; Minister Peng Declares at a Press Conference <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 27th] The Ministry of Information held a press conference at 3:30 PM on the 27th in the representatives' lounge of the National Assembly Hall, hosted by Peng Xuepei. The newly appointed Ambassador to the Holy See, Wu Jingxiong, was also invited to attend, to answer questions from reporters regarding the constitutional draft. Peng first answered reporters' questions as follows:</p>
<p>Question: What are the announced quotas and allocations for each party within the National Assembly representatives?</p>
<p>Answer: The total number of National Assembly representatives is 2,050. The National Government has announced 1,744 representatives, of which 847 are non-partisan, accounting for 48% of the total. The Kuomintang has 725 representatives, accounting for 42% of the total. The remaining 118 are from the Youth Party, and 54 from the Democratic Socialist Party, together accounting for 10%. Regarding the "iron party" issue, when the first National Political Consultative Conference was convened in 1938, the Social Democratic Party, the Communist Party, the Youth Party, and the Kuomintang were all present, of which three "iron parties" have already participated in the National Assembly. Furthermore, the Political Consultative Conference convened this spring was attended by five parties: the Kuomintang, the Communist Party, the Youth Party, social notables, and the Democratic League. Currently, only the Communist Party and a portion of the Democratic League have not participated in the National Assembly. Therefore, the claim that the Kuomintang is holding the National Assembly alone is inaccurate and a misrepresentation.</p>
<p>Question: Some people have criticized the government for violating the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference. What is your opinion?</p>
<p>Answer: The best answer to this question is the constitutional draft itself. The currently revised Draft Constitution of the Republic of China is based on and revised according to the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference. Furthermore, we can examine who first instigated military action in the Northeast, who constantly sabotaged transportation, refused to participate in the National Government Committee, refused to nominate candidates, and refused to participate in the National Assembly? And who secretly conducted the so-called "People's Congress," preventing the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference from being implemented? It is not difficult to understand who is responsible.</p>
<p>Question: To what extent does the National Assembly comply with the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference?</p>
<p>Answer: Its non-violation of the Political Consultative Conference can be explained in three points: (1) Date: The Political Consultative Conference decided that the National Assembly would be convened on May 5th of this year. Subsequently, the Communist Party and other "iron parties" requested a postponement to November. When the time came, the Communist Party still refused to participate. This clearly shows who is enthusiastic about implementing the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference, and who is not. (2) Quotas: The current allocation of quotas is still based on the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference. The vacant seats of the Communist Party and the Democratic League are still being reserved for their participation. (3) The constitutional draft is based on the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference and is revised to be adopted by the National Assembly.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 27th] At the press conference held by the Ministry of Information on the 27th, when asked about the statement by a government spokesman quoted in a dispatch from Reuters correspondent Logan in Nanjing on the 26th, that if the Communist Party decides to convene a so-called "People's Congress in the Liberated Areas" and the Communist army continues to attack Suinan and Yulin, the National Army will launch a punitive offensive against Yan'an, Minister Peng replied: "The government has indeed received reports about the Communist Party's attempt to convene a so-called 'People's Congress in the Liberated Areas,' but we hope it is not true. As for the matters stated in the Reuters dispatch, it was not a conversation I had and may be due to a misinterpretation of the Zhongshi News Agency's draft on the same day."</p>
<h3 id="e3">Spokesman for the CCP in Nanjing Denies Convening a People's Congress <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 27th] Mei Yi, a spokesman for the CCP office, denied reports on the 27th evening that the Communist army would convene a People's Congress in the Liberated Areas and that the Eighth Route Army was attacking Yulin, stating that there was no such thing. Regarding the report by a certain military observer that "the government will be forced to attack Yan'an," he said that the government's intention to attack Yan'an had long been heard, but it was worth noting whether this news, after being issued, would be put into action starting from today. This news has also been telegraphed to the Yan'an Border Region Government today. Mei also denied the rumor that Mao Zedong had left Yan'an for the Soviet Union, saying that since the 29th of this month is Zhu De's 60th birthday, Mao will stay in Yan'an to celebrate and will definitely not leave.</p>
<h3 id="e4">Infighting Among Senior CCP Generals Becoming Increasingly Apparent <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xi'an, 27th] It has been learned here that the infighting among senior generals on the Yan'an CCP side has become increasingly apparent. Mao Zedong, leading his direct line generals Zhu De, He Long, Lin Biao, Chen Yi, Liu Bocheng, and others, firmly advocates seizing power through military means. Chen Shaoyu, Feng Wenbin, Wang Jiaxiang, Lu Dingyi, Liu Shaoqi, Li Fuchun, and others advocate striving for power through political means. Therefore, Mao is carrying out the second rectification movement, attacking the Chen faction, and ordering party members to monitor their actions and freedom, except when necessary to avoid emergency danger, maintain social order, or promote public interests, shall not be restricted by law." I once researched a clause that seemed better than Mr. Zhang Junmai's, but for the sake of democracy, I abandoned it.</p>
<p>(3) In Chapter 3, the addition of a provision for National Assembly representatives to serve on the Legislative and Supervisory Yuan was criticized by followers of Sun Yat-sen, who believed that the Legislative and Supervisory Yuan were governing bodies, while the National Assembly was a political body, and should be independent of each other and not confused. However, because Mr. Zhang Junmai insisted on the principle of parliamentary politics, although we believed that according to Sun Yat-sen's teachings, the Legislative and Supervisory Yuan should be responsible to the National Assembly, we ultimately relented. In my opinion, political power and governing power are logically separate, but in practice they should be connected in order to be used flexibly, and there are currently some legislators and political officials who are representatives to the National Assembly.</p>
<p>(4) In Chapter 4, the powers of the president have been changed very little. The Political Consultative Conference once wanted to delete Article 45 of the Fifth Fifth Constitution Draft, which stated that "The President may convene the heads of the five Yuan to discuss matters concerning two or more Yuan and matters on which the President seeks advice," but at the last review meeting (Communist Party representatives were not present), Mr. Zhang Junmai pointed out that if disputes arise between the Yuan, and the National Assembly is not in session, and there is no special person or institution to mediate, how can the disputes be resolved? Political affairs will inevitably be greatly affected. Later, it was decided to compromise and revise it to "The President may convene the heads of the relevant Yuan to discuss and resolve disputes between the Yuan, except as otherwise provided in this Constitution."</p>
<p>(5) Regarding the relationship between the Legislative Yuan and the Executive Yuan, the Fifth Fifth Constitution Draft treated them as independent entities, not responsible to the National Assembly. Now, adopting the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference, it has been revised to require the President to obtain the consent of the Legislative Yuan for the appointment of the President of the Executive Yuan, and the Executive Yuan is also responsible to the Legislative Yuan for certain matters. This has adopted some of the checks and balances principles of the American Constitution, which can be said to be a limited presidential system, with some elements of a cabinet system.</p>
<p>(6) In Chapter 10, regarding the powers of the central and local governments, some changes have been made compared to the Fifth Fifth Constitution Draft, in accordance with the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference. The national political system is neither a federal system nor an absolutely unitary system. This new type of system can be regarded as China's contribution to constitutional law. As for the popular election of provincial governors and the enhancement of the status of provinces, this is both a resolution of the Political Consultative Conference and Sun Yat-sen's original intention.</p>
<p>(7) The interpretation of the Constitution has been changed in every draft since 1925. The Fifth Fifth Constitution Draft stipulated that it should be proposed by the Control Yuan and implemented by the Judicial Yuan, while the revised draft attributes it to the Judicial Yuan, as it has been determined that the Judicial Yuan is the highest judicial body. Mr. Wu first explained in English, then briefly translated it into Chinese, using vivid metaphors and eloquent language. He also stated that although he attended the reception at the invitation of Minister Peng, his interpretations were not representative of the official position, but were merely expressed in a personal capacity. Finally, he expressed his personal views on the revised draft, saying: "I believe that law is a practical science, and in order for it to be implemented and to be effective, it must be supported by the public. Now that the revised draft includes opinions from all parties, it is more complete and easier to implement than the Fifth Fifth Constitution Draft. Therefore, despite the revisions to the Fifth Fifth Constitution Draft, I still express my heartfelt satisfaction with the revised draft."</p>

<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Dr. Wu Jingxiong, our ambassador to the Holy See in Rome, has reserved a cabin on the French postal ship General Xiafei, scheduled to depart from Shanghai on December 20th, accompanied by his family and staff.</p>

<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 27th] Wu Jingxiong, one of the drafters of the Fifth Fifth Constitution Draft and a participant in the revision of the constitutional draft, explained the key points of the revised draft at a press conference held by the Ministry of Information on the afternoon of the 27th, as follows:</p>
<p>Article 1 of Chapter 1 of the Fifth Fifth Constitution Draft stated that "The Republic of China is a Republic based on the Three Principles of the People." Now, according to the opinions of various parties, it has been changed to "The Republic of China is a democratic republic based on the Three Principles of the People, of the People, by the People, and for the People." Although the wording is more cumbersome, the spirit is not greatly different. What differs from the United States is that President Lincoln's "of the people, by the people, for the people" refers to the nature of the government. The revised draft's "Owned by the People," "Governed by the People," and "Enjoyed by the People" refer to the nation [Republic the wealth]. "Of the people," "by the people," and "for the people" refer to the nature of the government.</p>
<p>(2) In Chapter 2, regarding the freedom of the people, the Fifth Fifth Constitution Draft had the clause "Shall not be restricted except in accordance with the law." Now, according to the resolution of the Political Consultative Conference, positive guarantees are used to replace negative guarantees, and the clause is removed. However, in order to prevent freedom from becoming unbridled, Article 24 has been added: "Regarding the freedoms and rights listed above, except for the purpose of preventing obstruction of others</p>

<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 27th] Due to difficulties in securing seats on China National Aviation Corporation flights, Democratic Socialist Party National Assembly representatives Shi Zhiquan (legal scholar, currently President of Chaoyang College) and Wang Zhihai did not leave Beiping for Nanjing until 8:30 AM on the 27th. Veteran of the Beiping branch of the party, Ji Yiqiao, traveled with them. It is also reported that Zhang Dongsun, Hu Haimen, Liang Qiushui, and others oppose participating in the National Assembly. Key members of the Democratic Socialist Party will hold a meeting at Liang Qiushui's residence tomorrow afternoon, where they may further express their views to the public.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 27th] A reporter recently inquired with Jiang Yuntian, a member of the Standing Committee of the Democratic Socialist Party, about rumors that the Democratic Socialist Party was considering withdrawing from the Democratic League. According to him, it is not necessarily that the Democratic Socialist Party must leave the Democratic League, but rather whether their opinions are the same. If they are not the same, then separation is only natural. As for rumors that Zhang Dongsun and Hu Haimen are leaving the Democratic Socialist Party, there is absolutely no basis for that. Furthermore, Lei Zhen, Secretary-General of the Political Consultative Conference, hosted a banquet for Democratic Socialist Party members Jiang Yuntian, Xu Fulin, Wu Xianzi, and Yang Junming on the evening of the 27th.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Changchun, 27th] Ye Jianying, the Communist Party representative of the Beiping Military Mediation Department, arrived in Changchun by plane from Beiping at 11:00 AM on the 27th. After a one-hour stop at the airport, he continued his flight to Harbin. It is said that this trip is to discuss how to carry out coordination work in the Northeast in the future. Zhou Liwu, the Chief of Staff of the government side of the Changchun Branch, went to the airport to meet him. Furthermore, Colonel Tyson, the American Executive Director of the Changchun Branch, and Wu Xiuquan, the Communist Party representative, also flew to Harbin on the same plane.</p>

<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 27th] Special Envoy Marshall and his wife left Beiping for Qingdao on their way back to Nanjing at 10:40 AM on the 27th. It is understood that they will confer with Admiral Cooke while passing through Qingdao. Mr. and Mrs. Marshall had breakfast with Gillon at the residence at 9:00 AM on the morning of the 27th, and then drove to the airport in the howling wind. Because senior officials in Beiping were not informed of the exact date of his departure in advance, only Mayor He Siyuan, Police Chief Tang Yongxian, and Hu Zhongjing, Director of the Foreign Affairs Office of the Eleventh War Zone, were present at the airport to see him off. Aside from Gillon and two or three others, no one knows the purpose of Marshall's trip. At Sun Lianzhong's banquet last night, Marshall only talked about past events in Tianjin and did not mention anything else. A qualified person hinted to reporters that Marshall's trip is still an effort for peace, and his specific tasks may be: (1) To stabilize the Military Mediation Department and inject a strong dose of reassurance into the ailing Military Mediation Department. (2) To prepare for a trip to Yan'an, using Ye Jianying as a bridge to conduct some preliminary discussions. However, it is not known whether Marshall himself still has strong confidence in this effort. It is rumored that Marshall's speech at the welcome party for Yenching University alumni was filled with pessimism. He said that the mediation work was like climbing a mountain, and just as he was about to reach the top, he was blocked by some people and pushed back down. China's economy is on the verge of collapse, and if it were in the United States, the people would definitely protest, but the Chinese people have no power.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Qingdao, 27th] Special Envoy Marshall and his wife flew to Qingdao on the morning of the 27th. All the leaders went to the airport to welcome them.

<h3 id="e13">Communist Troops Launch Large-Scale Offensive Against Guomindang Troops Encirclement Offensive in Hebei-Henan Region; Fierce Fighting South of Puyang, Guomindang Troops Retreat <a href="#e13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Baoding, 27th] According to a statement from relevant authorities, more than 80,000 Communist troops, driving tens of thousands of civilians, have moved to the front lines and launched a large-scale offensive southward from Puyang, implementing a large encirclement of Guomindang troops in southern Hebei and northern Henan. In order to comply with the ceasefire order, our troops have adopted a completely defensive posture and advised them to stop their attacks. The Communist troops took the opportunity to launch a fierce attack. In the area south of Puyang and east of Hua County, there was fierce fighting for three days and three nights starting on November 18th. The Guomindang troops were forced to retreat, and the Communist troops continued to intensify their offensive.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] On the evening of the 26th, the Communist troops completely gathered the residents of Daying Village in the northern section of the Pinghan Railway, forcibly moved them to the mountainous area of Mancheng, and set fire to their houses before leaving, creating an extremely tragic situation.</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 27th] Although the Communist troops in the northern section of the Pinghan Railway are moving frequently, no large-scale battles have occurred yet. The strength of the Guomindang troops is gradually increasing. The situation between Baoding and Ding County in the south is slightly worse. Yujiazhuang, Fangshunqiao, and Wangdu are still under the control of the Communist troops. The Wangdu County Chief has arrived in Baoding with the security police team. The military stated that, judging from the movements of the Communist troops, they are likely to repeat the offensive of September, and at the same time prepare for large-scale destruction of the railway, launching a general offensive against Liulihe, Zhuozidian, and Liangxiang stations north of Zhuozhou County. Currently, there are more than 20,000 Communist troops in Zhangfang Town west of Zhuozhou County, more than 10,000 in Maji Town to the east, and more than 2,000 in the area more than ten miles west of Songlindian. With the reinforcements from the Guomindang troops yesterday and today, the situation in Baoding, Caohe, and Xushui has stabilized. The roadbed between Dingxing and Caohe, which is not yet open to traffic in the Ping-Bao section, has been laid. Because two Japanese material depots that had not been handed over were newly discovered near Changxindian, there is no problem with materials. The difficulty lies in the North River Bridge project. Therefore, the completion of the Ping-Bao section is expected to be in the middle of next month. Furthermore, the central section of the Ping-Sui Railway between Zhangjiakou and Datong can be completed by the end of the year, and traffic can be opened on New Year's Day next year.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Taiyuan, 27th] (1) The Communist troops who invaded and occupied Daning in western Shanxi continued to flee towards Xi County on the 23rd and 24th, and replenished a large amount of ammunition to the west of the river. Their strength has now reached more than 10,000, with many mountain field guns. (2) The Communist troops who fled to the southeast of Guanshi Town, in order to cooperate with the northward invasion from Daning and encircle Xi County, also launched a fierce attack on Licun, Nanshengou, and Nanpingshan, north of the county seat, on the 25th.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] Two brigades of Communist troops stationed in Shuo County in northern Shanxi invaded and attacked Shanyin (i.e., Daiyue Town) on the 20th. The Guomindang troops stationed there defended their original positions and repeatedly frustrated their fierce attacks, but were forced to retreat to Ying County due to the overwhelming disparity in numbers.</p>
<h3 id="e14">Concentrating Eighteen Regiments of Troops in Northern Jiangsu; Communist Troops Attempt to Attack Dongtai; Songji North of Huaiyin Captured Yesterday <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>[Our Taizhou Dispatch, 27th] The short period of peace in northern Jiangsu has suddenly been replaced by a sense that a storm is about to break out. The Communist troops have concentrated eighteen regiments of troops on the outskirts of Dongtai City, threatening to attack Dongtai. The tension near Huaiyin may be a prelude to a major battle. The Guomindang troops stationed in Dongtai are currently making proper deployments and paying close attention to defense. If the Communist troops recklessly disrupt the ceasefire and harass Dongtai, the Guomindang troops will launch a self-defense counterattack within a certain scope.</p>
<p>[Our Zhenjiang Dispatch, 27th] Songji, north of Siyang, was recaptured by the Guomindang troops on the 25th. In this battle, the Communist troops suffered more than 5,000 casualties. The Communist troops are now continuously reinforcing Siyang. However, the Communist troops in northern Jiangsu are currently lacking both weapons and ammunition, and it will be difficult for the offensive to last. Once the Guomindang troops are forced to counterattack, the Communist troops on that line can be completely eliminated in one fell swoop.</p>
<p>[Our Zhenjiang Dispatch, 27th] It is learned that Wulizhuang in Songji, north of Huaiyin, was captured by the Communist troops today. The Guomindang troops were forced to retreat and are now defending the line of Yugou, Dingji, and Baji. The Guomindang troops maintain a superior force, and morale is stable. There was also contact with the large concentration of Communist troops in Baiju, Dongtai, today.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 27th] Military news: Taking advantage of the ceasefire, a group of Communist troops invaded and occupied the three townships of Bo'ai, Longgang, and Zhenhu in Suqian yesterday, and then attempted to attack the county seat. The county's self-defense force and border defense force are strictly guarding and blocking the area from Qibao Township to Zhihekou on the west bank of the Grand Canal on the 27th.</p>
<p>[Our Jinan Dispatch, 26th] After the Communist troops re-invaded the outskirts of Jinan, the atmosphere has become tense. Many citizens return home early at night, and business in cinemas and entertainment venues has declined sharply. The news that the Communist troops are eager to expand their offensive has become the most concerning issue for the people.</p>

<p>[Our Zhenjiang Dispatch, 27th] News from Dongtai: The Communist troops in Dingxi and Cao Yan have not yet been cleared, and they disturb the area from time to time.

<h3 id="e18">Communist Troops Rampantly Disturb Various Locations in Northern Shaanxi; Self-Defense Forces Repeatedly Attacked; Looting of Livestock Everywhere; Villagers Fleeing in Droves <a href="#e18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Yaoxian by this Newspaper, Dated the 27th] Since Chairman Chiang issued another ceasefire order, the Nationalist Army has retreated from the blockhouse line stretching over 200 li in Xunyi, Chunhua, Yaoxian, Tongguan, Yijun, and other places in northern Shaanxi, replaced by local civilian self-defense forces. Taking advantage of the weak, Communist troops have launched continuous attacks from all sides since the 11th, causing extreme tension along the entire line. The self-defense forces are armed with red-tasseled spears, with a few dilapidated rifles that are practically useless against the Communist troops. Each county has four companies, and in the past two weeks, the Communist troops have eliminated three and a half companies in Tongguan, one and a half in Yijun, and half a company in Yaoxian. The county magistrates are constantly complaining, at a complete loss. On the 24th, this reporter traveled north from Sanyuan and witnessed Communist troops crossing the line and advancing to within eight li of Yaoxian city that evening. They were persuaded by the National Army defending the city to withdraw, but the tense situation has not eased. Every time the Communist troops capture a place, they take all the villagers' livestock, cotton, bedding, and grain, especially livestock, which they seem to need. However, they do not have the strength to capture any county seat. The villagers near the blockhouse line are currently in a state of unprecedented fear. The villagers in Jianzhuang Town, Yijun, have fled completely, leaving no one in sight for 90 li, because the area is filled with hills and ravines, making it impossible for villages to watch out for each other. The four small coal mines in Tongguan - Xinyu, Minsheng, Xiejian, and Tongtai - have all been raided by the Communist troops, who took away livestock and supplies, and more than twenty workers including the assistant manager of the Xiejian mine were also taken away, but were suddenly released on the morning of the 25th. The demarcation of the front line in northern Shaanxi was determined in March of the 26th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1937], with a ten-li buffer zone between the two armies. This buffer zone is now in the hands of the Communist troops, as observed by this reporter. Yesterday morning, more than twenty well-equipped Communist troops were discovered east of Huangbao Town, thirty li north of Yaoxian. In the Huanglong Mountain area east of the Yaoxian-Zhongdu highway, there are also 2,000 armed men who have occupied the area for several days. The self-defense forces armed with red-tasseled spears retreat in fear when they see them, and the National Army finds it difficult to advance or retreat, because while the National Army knows that these are Communist troops and not bandits, they can still use the ceasefire order as an excuse.</p>

Mr. Lei proposed that the Soviet army be responsible for the south bank of the river, and our army be responsible for the north bank. Since technical issues were involved, no concrete solution was reached. The Soviet side also indicated that they are currently supplying 3,000 kilowatts of electricity per day, and further discussions can be held if more is needed. The talks ended in a pleasant atmosphere.</p>

Finally, he also inquired about the situation of our state-owned enterprises, hoping to learn about the production of factories and mines under the Resources Commission. Mr. Wu hoped that the British side could provide information on (1) industrial and commercial laws, (2) the reactions of the public after the nationalization of some industries, (3) the situation of general manufacturers, and (4) patent and trademark laws. Mr. Carmichael answered to the best of his knowledge and promised to collect detailed information after returning to his country for our reference.

<p>[Dispatch from the Central News Agency, Nanjing, Dated the 27th] The National Federation of Commerce previously requested the Ministry of Finance and Treasury to (1) exempt income tax and profit tax for the 34th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1945], (2) abolish the excessive profit tax during the extraordinary period, (3) restore the pre-war business tax rate, and (4) reduce the stamp tax rate. It is now reported that the Ministry of Finance has approved or rejected the requests separately. The Excessive Profit Tax Law during the Extraordinary Period will be abolished at the end of this year. The Special Excessive Profit Tax Law will be implemented from January of the 36th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1947], with increased tax exemption and reduced tax rate. The business tax rate and stamp tax rate can be considered for revision in the future, but for the time being, they should still be levied according to the current tax law. As for the income and profit tax for the 34th year, it has already been exempted in the recovered areas. The current levy is based on the income and profit of various industries in the 34th year, and the income and profit tax payable in the 35th year is naturally not exempt according to the law. Also, it is learned that according to reports from local direct tax bureaus, the collection of income and profit tax is proceeding smoothly and can be fully collected before the end of the year.</p>

(2) Allied nations should support each other regarding the demand for compensation for losses suffered by overseas citizens of Allied nations. (3) The investigation and registration of losses suffered by foreign nationals in China should be handled by the embassies and consulates of the respective countries in China on the basis of reciprocity, and then sent to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for transfer to the Compensation Committee of the Executive Yuan for registration.</p>
<p>It is also learned that the diplomatic authorities have decided to submit a special proposal to the peace conference with Japan, requesting compensation for the wartime losses of overseas Chinese in China.</p>

<p>[Dispatch from the Central News Agency, Nanjing, Dated the 27th] Since 1938, the French authorities in the French-owned islands of Madagascar, Reunion, and Tahiti have prohibited overseas Chinese from remitting money back to China. To date, this has reached 8 years. Our government has made repeated representations, but without results. After the end of the war, the French side again used the excuse of limited foreign exchange funds to limit overseas Chinese to remitting only 180 pounds per person per year, and the procedures are complicated, which is tantamount to not lifting the ban. As a result, relatives of overseas Chinese residing in the country have not been able to receive assistance. The 200,000 francs raised by overseas Chinese in Madagascar for the Double Tenth Festival to provide relief to domestic refugees last year also could not be remitted. Our government is extremely concerned about this and has once again raised serious objections to the French side.</p>

<p>[Dispatch from the Central News Agency, Beiping, Dated the 27th] Beiping recently smashed a case of smuggling gold using air transport. According to Ni Chao, the director of the Investigation Department of the Garrison Headquarters, it was recently reported that someone was using airplanes to smuggle gold. On the 20th, the department was patrolling near Eleventh Alley, Dongcheng, and intercepted Zhang Peizhen and others, associates of a gold shop, who were delivering money to No. 13, Eleventh Alley. Many cars were parked in front of the door, and they were formally moving goods. After a joint inspection by the police and military police, it was learned that the place was a dormitory for employees of China National Aviation Corporation. Five willow boxes of legal tender, totaling 105 million yuan, were seized. It turned out that Yang Baofan, the person in charge of the company, Guo Ditang, the director of the radio station, Yang Donghuan, the pilot, and Xu Rong, the assistant, were entrusted by businessmen such as Zhang Peizhen to purchase and transport gold bars from Shanghai to Beiping for sale, and to purchase cigarettes and other items on their behalf. While the inspection was in progress, Guo Ditang successively brought back two willow boxes containing cash, which was the proceeds from the sale of 23 gold bars. Three businessmen, Hou Zhaolin, Cui Hongjue, and Zhu Zhenzhong, brought 9,400 US dollars and entrusted pilot Xue to take them to Shanghai. Another businessman, Wang Haishan, brought 12.78 million yuan, which was the proceeds from the sale of gold on behalf of the pilot, and all were seized and sent to the court for handling.

<h3 id="e37">The Start of Formal Constitution-Making Work <a href="#e37" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c37" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">37</a></h3>
<p>After intense debate, the National Assembly has passed the rules of procedure and is scheduled to hold its third meeting this morning, at which Chairman Chiang himself will present the draft constitution for discussion. The task of this National Assembly is to formulate a practical and feasible democratic constitution, so from today onwards, the National Assembly can be said to have entered the stage of formally starting constitution-making.</p>
<p>In the past few days, the proceedings of the National Assembly have been somewhat chaotic, causing the National Assembly to make slow progress. Democratic politics is inherently time-consuming, especially since we are just beginning to learn the process of democratic politics. When the General Assembly discusses issues, it is naturally inevitable that debates will continue, so in general, it is satisfactory. In particular, the generous speeches of some representatives were full of the spirit of democracy. In our country's political history, it can be regarded as the beginning of a new political style.</p>
<p>However, from today onwards, the National Assembly will begin discussing the draft constitution. Everyone knows that the constitution is the fundamental law of the country, related to the foundation of the country, and is a code that is jointly observed by the whole country. On the one hand, it must have lofty ideals, and on the other hand, it must take into account the country's real situation. The people of the country have their own propositions and aspirations for the ideals of the constitution. They also have their own understanding and opinions on the country's real situation. Therefore, it is inevitable that the people of the country will have a complex array of opinions on the ideals and essence of the constitution. If the National Assembly representatives cannot take a broad approach when discussing the draft constitution and want to debate endlessly on any issue, then the National Assembly session will inevitably be prolonged, and it is unknown when it will be able to complete its constitution-making task. What kind of impact will this have on politics? What kind of impression will the National Assembly make on the people? These are all worthy of the attention of the National Assembly representatives.</p>
<p>In the past few days, various parties have expressed their opinions on the draft constitution that is about to be submitted to the National Assembly for discussion. It is originally a gratifying phenomenon that the people of the country attach such importance to the fundamental law of the future, but the opinions provided by all parties are biased towards policy aspects. We believe that constitution-making is a major plan for the country for a hundred years. In addition to the fundamental national policies that have no time limit, which should be stipulated, other ordinary policies should not be stipulated in the constitution and can wait for the announcement of the future new government. According to the precedents of British and French democratic countries, any cabinet should announce its policy direction to the parliament after its establishment. Therefore, the fact that the draft constitution does not specify ordinary policies in detail cannot be regarded as a shortcoming of the draft constitution, because the constitution cannot make complicated provisions. This is one reason. There is no absolute good or absolute evil in political systems. There are both advantages and disadvantages to both the American-style presidential system and the British-style cabinet system. As long as it is suitable for our country's national conditions and is practical and easy to implement, it can be adopted. There is no need to adhere to a certain one, which will cause controversy. This is the second reason. Although the May Fifth Draft Constitution was formulated through long-term and meticulous discussion by the Legislative Yuan, it has been eight or nine years, and there are bound to be places that are not suitable for the times. Although the amendments passed by the Legislative Yuan cannot be said to be perfect, they are at least more progressive than the May Fifth Draft Constitution. National Assembly representatives must not have any prejudices against this. This is the third reason.</p>
<p>In short, we hope that the National Assembly representatives will not relax their efforts on the important key points of the constitution, but should seriously discuss and express their opinions as much as possible, so that the National Assembly is full of various opinions, and then the General Assembly will integrate and reconcile them to make wise choices. As for the clauses of the constitution, do not split hairs and ask for repeated revisions. These can allow experts in legislative technology to bear more responsibility for amendments. In this way, the constitution-making work of the National Assembly will surely have satisfactory results.</p>

<p>[Dispatch from Wujiang by this Newspaper, Dated the 27th] The Suzhou-Lili ferry boat departed from Suzhou for Lili at noon on the 26th. At 5 PM, when it sailed to a certain lake three or four li or six li away from Lili, it suddenly caught fire. Soon after, the cylinder exploded, and the boat was blown into two sections.

<h3 id="e39">Suzhou's Industry and Commerce, Amidst Storms, Plans to Borrow Heavily from Banks to Escape the Clutches of Usury and Weather the End of the Year <a href="#e39" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c39" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">39</a></h3>
<p>[Our Suzhou Dispatch] Recently, all sectors of industry and commerce in this city have been showing signs of recession. Within and outside the city walls, the number of shops closing down and liquidating their assets has been increasing daily. The main reason is the influence of usury or rotating credit associations (biaohui), to the point where usury and biaohui have become the target of public criticism. Speakers are filled with pain and indignation, viewing them as a fatal wound to merchants. The government authorities have also taken note of this, and talk of cracking down on them has been repeatedly reported in the newspapers. However, to crack down on usury, there must first be low-interest loans. If there are low-interest loans, then merchants will not need to resort to biaohui. The two are different paths to the same goal and are inherently cyclical. Moreover, those engaged in usury have already felt the great pain of business failures due to the frequent closing of shops and are about to decline on their own. The trend of dissolving biaohui is quite prevalent, and the credit of biaohui has long been completely lost. Both can collapse on their own without the need for a crackdown. However, whether the economy of shops or individuals can obtain any benefits and be able to adjust their finances after usury and biaohui disappear is still a serious question. Now that the Western New Year is near, and the Lunar New Year is not far off, if a fundamental solution is not urgently sought, the trend of closing down and liquidating assets may spread uncontrollably, and the entire future of Suzhou's industry and commerce may suffer an irreversible setback. Therefore, for the sake of their own vital interests, the various trade associations in this city have planned to solemnly propose to the county chamber of commerce to request that the various banks in Suzhou lend large sums of money with adequate collateral to weather this stormy end of the year.</p>

<p>[Our Suzhou Dispatch] The Suzhou Higher Procuratorate recently issued an arrest warrant for four cultural traitors, including: (1) Wang Zhengwei, who served as the Deputy Dean and Director of the Research Office of the pseudo-Jiangsu Provincial Educational College and specialized in "Greater East Asia Lectures." (2) Cao Hua, who served as the Secretary of the pseudo-Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education and the Principal of the pseudo-Jiangsu Provincial Japanese Language School. (3) Wei Lihua, who served as the Director of Instruction at the pseudo-Japanese Language School. (4) Jiang Fengjia, who served as the Chief of Affairs at the pseudo-Japanese Language School. The above four traitors jointly carried out propaganda for the enemy and the puppets' "Greater East Asia Policy" and enslaved the youth in the occupied areas. After the victory, all fled without a trace. After the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education sent a letter to the Ministry of Justice, which forwarded it to the Suzhou Higher Procuratorate, the Higher Procuratorate investigated and found the facts to be true. After several attempts to summon them without success, it filed a public prosecution according to law and issued an arrest warrant.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] Cheng Wanjun, the commander of the notorious pseudo-military First Division, was originally an anti-Japanese soldier who defected mid-way and became a traitor. He was appointed by the pseudo-Military Commission as the commander of the First Division of the pseudo-First Front Army and stationed in Wuxing and Wujiang, Zhejiang. He used his power to extort the people and assisted the enemy in carrying out the "cleansing the countryside" work in the Zhejiang area, hindering the national policy of resistance against Japan. After the victory, the traitor Cheng disappeared and fled to other places. Recently, the people of Wujiang County jointly filed a complaint with the Suzhou Higher Procuratorate. The Suzhou Higher Procuratorate considered that the traitor Cheng was originally a soldier and held a pseudo-military post, which was inconvenient to handle, and specially transferred the relevant case files of the traitor Cheng to the Military Law Department of the Jiangsu Provincial Security Command for trial.</p>

<h3 id="e57">Wang Maogong Informs County Magistrates That Taxation and Administration Should Closely Cooperate <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>[Our Zhenjiang Dispatch] Since the reorganization of tax collection agencies in various counties and cities of Jiangsu Province into tax collection offices on October 1st of this year, the collection situation in various counties and cities has been very smooth. Provincial Chairman Wang Maogong, considering that this is the beginning of the reorganization, and in order to closely coordinate taxation with local administration and promote balanced development, specially informed the county magistrates and mayors of three matters yesterday, earnestly urging them to work together harmoniously to facilitate the implementation of government orders. The gist of the original letter is recorded as follows: (1) The purpose of this reorganization of tax agencies is to strengthen collection work and unify the implementation of tax policies. The abundance or scarcity of tax revenue can affect local revenue, and the quality of management can affect the promotion of government affairs. The various county and city governments should still sincerely cooperate, work together, assist in overcoming difficulties, facilitate collection, and supervise nearby to achieve practical results. (2) The establishment of a personnel system is the foundation of all undertakings. Tax officials must be specialized in their skills, and their integrity is highly valued. The provincial government's reorganization of tax agencies is still based on a consistent policy of clarifying tax administration and rectifying tax customs. The appointment of personnel will absolutely exclude favoritism and plug loopholes. The appointment, removal, and promotion of tax personnel will be based on talent and moral character. The Department of Finance has formulated a system of selection, training, and evaluation for centralized management and strict implementation, in order to establish a tax personnel system as soon as possible and maintain long-term compliance. It is appropriate to avoid private recommendations. Since tax work is close to money, the suspicion of secret dealings should be avoided even more. Those who have specialized knowledge, integrity, and can be competent can be directly recommended to the provincial department for evaluation and distribution to various offices for appointment, in order to conform to the meaning of selecting people for public service and recommending talents to serve the country. (3) Tax agencies are responsible for increasing local revenue and providing support for expenses, and the tasks are heavy and complicated. It is essential to ensure that funding is not short and that personnel can work with peace of mind. In the future, all expenses of the tax collection office should be allocated on time in accordance with the regulations of the provincial department. If tax funding is insufficient, it will inevitably affect the collection work, and a shortage of revenue will make government expenses difficult. This principle is simple and easy to understand and need not be repeated. After the establishment of the tax collection office, whether the business can be developed smoothly is deeply related to the three matters mentioned above. It is hoped that careful consideration will be given and that the matters will be implemented earnestly in order to observe the results together.</p>

He picked up several quills, which were about seven inches long and pure white, like ivory chopsticks.</p>

<p>[Our Hefei Dispatch, 27th] After the completion of the first phase of the Anhui Province river embankment project, the dikes are now effective, and there has been a bumper harvest along the river. The survey and design of the second phase of the project has now been completed.

It has recently ordered the relevant counties along the river to work with the River Embankment Repair and Defense Engineering Office to collect a large number of laborers for construction and set a deadline for completion.</p>

<p>[Our Wuhu Dispatch] The Wuhu Water Plant was founded by the enemy during the occupation. It was later taken over and sold by the Enemy-Puppet Property Handling Bureau. The Wuhu Municipal Construction Committee believes that the water plant is of great importance to the lives of the citizens and is a public utility. It has resolved to purchase it by the committee and has appointed responsible persons for the purchase. However, the amount of money required is huge, and it is difficult to attract shares. Recently, it has been heard that the Ministry of the Interior has proposed that municipal organs have the right to request the unconditional transfer of such public utilities to local management. Therefore, in addition to consulting with the office of the Handling Bureau stationed in Anhui, the committee has also telegraphed the Anhui Provincial Government to request the Ministry of the Interior to allow for an unconditional takeover. Before the takeover, due to the insufficient number of water stations and the narrow streets and dense houses in the Wuhu urban area, in order to take into account fire hazards, it has been decided to conduct a general survey of all ponds and ditches and request the assistance of the Anhui Relief Branch to thoroughly dredge them through work-for-relief. Recently, the water plant has also increased the water fee for users from 1,000 yuan to 1,500 yuan per degree and the retail price at water stations from 160 yuan to 200 yuan per shi in order to maintain costs due to the rising price of coal.</p>

<h3 id="e64">Byrnes Suddenly Changes Direction; The Four Powers Engage in Secret Diplomacy to Try to Break the Deadlock in Peace Treaty Negotiations <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, New York, 27th] The Four Powers, seeing that the meetings of the past few weeks have been in a stalemate, have changed direction today and adopted a strategy of "secret diplomacy." The four foreign ministers held secret talks in Secretary of State Byrnes's private reception room at the Astor Astoria Hotel, discussing the Italian peace treaty, especially the Trieste issue, excluding anyone but translators. This new direction in the negotiations between the Four Powers was initiated by Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov. Molotov, expressing pessimism over Byrnes's slow progress in the meeting, requested a private meeting with Byrnes to discuss openly and accelerate the work of the Foreign Ministers' meeting. Byrnes, who had previously insisted on "open diplomacy" at the Paris Peace Conference, accepted Molotov's suggestion because Byrnes had recently felt the great inconvenience of public discussion. Political observers believe that if the Soviet Union is willing to make concessions and the United Kingdom and the United States are willing to compromise with the Soviet Union on some points, then it is necessary to minimize publicity on these inevitable concessions that will facilitate the agreement. The opportunity for this secret talk came at Byrnes's luncheon for the three foreign ministers today. After coffee, the four foreign ministers secretly discussed the Trieste issue, especially the powers of the Governor of Trieste and the withdrawal of foreign troops. Observers speculate that no decisions have been made yet, but an optimistic atmosphere prevails. The four foreign ministers will resume secret talks at Byrnes's tea party tomorrow. Observers believe that this method of negotiation is open to criticism, but the important thing is the outcome. As long as this negotiation is consistent with the new principles of international law and morality, it does not matter if it is obtained through so-called outdated methods.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, New York, 26th] After Secretary of State Byrnes's direct talks with Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov yesterday, he held secret talks with British Foreign Secretary Bevin today, seeking ways to reduce small countries' criticism of the veto power of large countries. The Soviet Union firmly insists that the Charter cannot be arbitrarily amended, and there is no concrete indication whether it is willing to make concessions. The purpose of these separate talks is to accelerate the work of the Foreign Ministers' meeting and is based on the United States' proposal to automatically amend the issue of the use of the veto power.</p>
<h3 id="e65">The Soviet Union Adopts a Forceful Stance Towards Britain and the United States, Demanding Disclosure of Military Intelligence, Including Missiles and Atomic Weapons, Leading to Further Disputes in the UN Political and Security Committee <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] San Francisco, 27th (Broadcast): Discussions among delegates at the UN General Assembly regarding the issue of investigating the number of foreign troops are becoming increasingly heated, now reaching a critical stage for decision-making. In essence, the Soviet representative's lengthy argument plainly tells other nations: "If you want to know how many Soviet troops there are, you must first disclose how many atomic bombs you have." Discussions on this issue have lasted for five days without any resolution.</p>
<p>[United Press, Lake Success, 26th] Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov directly questioned the United States and Britain today at the UN General Assembly's Political and Security Committee, asking whether they were prepared to immediately report all their peacetime atomic bombs and rocket weapons. This led to further disputes at the committee meeting. British representative Noel-Baker immediately launched a heated counterattack, stating that he was prepared to do so, just like Molotov and the Soviet Union. US representative Connally did not directly respond. After three hours of heated debate, the meeting adjourned until Wednesday. In addition, there is still no hope of breaking the deadlock on the issue of reporting troop deployments. Although the Soviet Union, the United States, and Britain have agreed in principle on this matter, they disagree on the methods and locations for investigation. The Soviet Union demands investigation of foreign troops, bases, and military equipment, with "foreign" including former enemy countries. The United States wants to further investigate all troops, both foreign and domestic. Britain supports the US proposal but believes that a fact-finding mission should be dispatched by the Security Council, which the United States opposes. During today's meeting, Molotov also replied to Noel-Baker, stating that if his suggestion were to be expanded, it should include weapons, which must include atomic bombs, missiles, and all other weapons. How can troops fight without weapons? Investigating only the number of armed forces does not solve the problem, he said. Although Molotov still disagreed on the issue of investigating domestic troops, he argued that member nations could "report their armed forces and equipment within their territories so that the Security Council could discuss disarmament."</p>

He stated that the United Nations' duty lies in eliminating racial and religious discrimination, which is a great social calamity, and is prohibited in the Soviet Constitution. South African representative Smuts argued that the treatment of Indian expatriates in South Africa is better than that of black people, demonstrating that the discrimination case has a dual nature.

<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 27th] According to diplomatic circles, November 29th marks the anniversary of the inauguration of Nepalese Prime Minister Padma Shamsher Jang Bahadur Rana. The Chinese government has specially appointed Shen Zonglian, Director of the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission's Office in Tibet, as a special envoy for the celebration, and will present the Nepalese Prime Minister with a Special Grand Cordon of the Precious Tripod Medal and the rank of Army General. Special Envoy Shen, along with Military Attaché Le Yaoxiang stationed in India and Consul Chen Yiyuan stationed in Calcutta, arrived in Kathmandu, the Nepalese capital, on the 26th, and the awarding ceremony is scheduled for the 28th, with participation in the Prime Minister's inauguration anniversary celebrations on the 29th. Nepal has had close relations with China in the past. According to the regulations of the 57th year of Qianlong (1792), Nepal paid tribute once every five years. The tribute in the 34th year of Guangxu (1908) was the last one during the late Qing Dynasty. Tribute was also paid in the early years of the Republic of China, but it was later interrupted for some reason. On the Chinese side, the Qing government sent an envoy to Nepal in the 31st year of Guangxu to confer the title of "Commander of Troops, Valiant King" on its Prime Minister (the King is the nominal head of state, with the Prime Minister in charge of national affairs). After the establishment of the Nationalist government in Nanjing, Zhang Ming, Consul General stationed in Calcutta, was dispatched in February of the 21st year (1932) to represent the government and present Prime Minister Bhim Shamsher Jang Bahadur Rana with the First Class Precious Tripod Medal and the rank of Army General. When Juddha Shamsher Jang Bahadur Rana succeeded as Prime Minister in the 21st year, the Chinese government dispatched Liang Changpei, Consul General stationed in Calcutta, to Nepal in the 23rd year to present him with the First Class Precious Tripod Medal and the rank of Army General. Juddha Shamsher Jang Bahadur Rana retired on November 29th last year, and his nephew Padma Shamsher Jang Bahadur Rana succeeded him as Prime Minister, with November 29th marking the first anniversary of his inauguration. Padma Shamsher Jang Bahadur Rana was born on December 2, 1882. After graduating from a high school in the Nepalese capital, he served in the military. From 1909 to 1914, he was extensively involved in water and electricity construction projects. The important water and electricity and transportation construction projects in Nepal today were mostly operated by him at that time. During the First World War, he led Nepalese troops to guard the northwest border, repeatedly achieving military merits. He served as Commander of the Nepalese Army in 1929, and was promoted to Senior Commander in 1932. He succeeded his uncle as Prime Minister of Nepal in 1945.</p>

<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 26th] It has been learned that Indian Viceroy Wavell has been summoned by the British government and will travel to London by plane within days, along with two representatives each from the Congress Party and the Muslim League, and one representative from the Sikh community, to consult with government authorities. It is expected that they will arrive in London around December 1st or 2nd. According to well-informed sources, the British government, in light of the Indian Constituent Assembly scheduled to open on December 9th, is eager to hear directly from India's major political parties and Wavell, and to discuss a method to ensure that this meeting becomes an effective and productive one. However, the reaction of the Indian political parties to the British government's invitation is still unknown.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, New Delhi, 26th] It is widely rumored in political circles here that all ministers from the Congress Party in the Indian interim government will resign. Viceroy Wavell met with Nehru this afternoon, and the theme of the discussion was likely to prepare for the convening of the Constituent Assembly.</p>
<h3 id="e77">Roosevelt's Son Delivers Speech in the Soviet Union, Vehemently Anti-American and Pro-Soviet, Revealed by American Magazine "Newsweek" <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper's Special Correspondent in New York, 27th] The "Newsweek" magazine published today an article on Elliot Roosevelt's vehement anti-American and pro-Soviet speech. It is said that this speech was delivered at a banquet in the American Embassy in the Soviet Union, attended by important figures from the United States, the Soviet Union, and the Soviet Union's External Cultural Association. The contents of Elliot Roosevelt's speech are as follows: "The United States has no reason to interfere in the affairs of the Danube River basin. The US government must not be willing to go to war because it wants to establish an international regime on the Danube River. The same goes for the issue of the Black Sea Straits. It is clear that the Soviet Union should gain control of the Black Sea Straits, unless the United States agrees to internationalize the Panama Canal, and unless Britain also accepts the establishment of an internationalized regime in Suez and Gibraltar, the Soviet Union will never be so foolish as to agree to establish an international regime in the Black Sea Straits. The Soviet Union has never broken its promises, but the British and American sides have repeatedly violated the promises of Tehran, Yalta, and Potsdam. In order to deal with the expansionist policies of Britain and the United States, the Soviet Union should create friendly regimes in neighboring countries." Elliot then asked, "Can anyone point out a fact showing that the United States has made further efforts for peace?" An American reporter replied that the United States is doing its best to strengthen the United Nations. Elliot had anticipated this response and immediately added, "The reason why Western countries support the United Nations is entirely for selfish and imperialist goals."</p>

<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] London, 27th (Broadcast): Anti-British demonstrations by students in Cairo are escalating. Today, a large group of students marching in protest against the Anglo-Egyptian agreement were again fired upon by police, and several students were seriously injured.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Cairo, 27th] After the Egyptian House of Representatives passed a vote of confidence in the Egyptian government yesterday by a vote of 159 to zero, the political situation in Egypt has cleared up. Three members abstained during the vote, while 62 opposition members withdrew from the chamber before the vote to protest the secret discussion of the Anglo-Egyptian draft treaty. Political figures predict that the government may not submit the treaty to the Senate, but opposition senators may demand that it be debated. It is generally expected that the Egyptian cabinet will meet today to authorize Foreign Minister Hafez to travel to London to make adjustments to the treaty. Finally, the two houses of the Egyptian parliament will hold a joint meeting to vote on it. Judging from the situation in the House of Representatives yesterday, passage is almost certain.</p>
<p>[United Press, Cairo, 26th] Egyptian King Farouk issued a decree today dissolving the Egyptian delegation for Anglo-Egyptian treaty revision negotiations, stating that its mission had no goals.

<p>Chinese Representative on the Allied Control Council Raises Questions</p>
<p>[Reconstruction News Agency, Tokyo, 27th] General MacArthur's headquarters today ordered the Japanese government to freeze all assets of the ten major zaibatsu for ten years, and the government will provide them with government bonds of the same amount. They are not allowed to mortgage or sell them, and they will be managed by the "Zaibatsu Company Reorganization Committee." The Ministry of Finance will supervise the payment of the family's living expenses. The ten major zaibatsu are: Ayukawa, Asano, Furukawa, Iwasaki, Mitsui, Nakajima, Nomura, Okura, Sumitomo, and Yasuda. Although the four major zaibatsu of Okouchi, Kawasaki, Matsushita, and Onsawa are not currently included, their assets will also be frozen in the same way if they stir up the Japanese economic world. The family assets of the four major zaibatsu families of Mitsui, Yasuda, Iwasaki, and Sumitomo, totaling approximately 2.5 billion yuan, have been transferred to the Zaibatsu Company Reorganization Committee.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Tokyo, 27th] The Allied Control Council for Japan held its twentieth regular meeting today. Representatives from China and the Soviet Union asked whether there were any foreign investments in Japanese zaibatsu companies. Mr. Cabot, Director of the Liquidation Division of General MacArthur's headquarters, replied that there was no such capital at present, but there were no regulations to prevent future investments. The British representative asked: When will the liquidation of the zaibatsu companies be completed? Mr. Cabot replied: It will take years. Finally, the Soviet representative requested MacArthur to allow representatives of the Allied nations to participate in the liquidation committee as observers.</p>
<h3 id="e81">Lewis and Coal Mine Owners Reportedly Begin Secret Negotiations, Government Plans to Use Pipelines to Transport Natural Coal Gas <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 26th] Reliable sources said today: Lewis, the leader of 400,000 coal miners, has begun secret negotiations with mine owners. This news has raised a glimmer of hope for resolving the coal mine strike. An internal spokesperson said: "Secret negotiations may be underway, but the bureau is not in a position to make a formal statement. We welcome any action that avoids disputes." Interior Secretary Krug is actively studying a plan to use wartime oil pipelines to transport natural coal gas from Texas to coal-using areas. If this plan is realized, it will be a permanent and dangerous competition for the bituminous coal industry. Deputy Secretary of State Acheson told reporters today that in addition to the complete prohibition of coal exports, the reduction of inland railway traffic due to the coal mine strike will also cause the transportation of food to be suspended. It is heard that steel production in some places has been reduced to 35% of normal production, and railway traffic may be further discounted. If the coal strike continues to drag on, one million more people will inevitably lose their jobs. It is heard that the mine owners have also contacted Veterans Affairs Director Steelman to restore negotiations between the mine owners and the union; however, President Truman is still taking a firm stance towards Lewis.</p>

<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 26th] John L. Lewis, former chairman of the United Mine Workers of America, is keeping his mouth shut about the miners' strike and is keeping silent. People call him a "living mute." However, according to reliable sources: the US government and industrial leaders are now trying to find a compromise solution to break the deadlock. American heavy industry is now gradually falling into a state of paralysis due to the shortage of coal. One million workers may be out of work by next week. The federal court is now scheduled to try Lewis tomorrow; but even if the government wins, it may not be able to get the miners back to work. Although the government authorities want to expedite the trial of Lewis, it may still take some time, or even weeks, to complete. If so, the coal mines will be returned to their original owners.</p>

<h3 id="e90">The Shuchai Steamer's Maiden Voyage to Kou'an: Grounded in an Accident in Heavy Fog; All Crew Members, Including Chen Ke, are Safe; Salvage is Under Discussion <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>"This newspaper reports" The Maotai Steamer of the Maoli Shipping Company, had an accident mid-voyage on its maiden voyage to Kou'an. Fortunately, the crew and passengers are safe. The crew returned to Shanghai yesterday on the Da Steamer. The details of the incident are recorded as follows: The Maotai Steamer was originally owned by the Daxin Shipping Company, with a tonnage of over 200 tons. Two months ago, Daxin Company sold it to Maoli Company, renamed it Maotai, and repaired it. It sailed the eastern Zhejiang route twice. On the 19th of this month, it changed its route to Kou'an. That morning, it set sail from Shanghai. The captain was Xu Fangyu. It went west out of Wusongkou, going up the river. After exiting the port, the captain handed over the helm to pilot Zheng Defu. As evening approached, the weather was not good, and the river surface gradually became foggy, but not thickly, using the buoy lighthouses as navigation targets. It continued to advance. At 1:20 AM that night, the lighthouse on the Jin Gang river surface in Duanshan was unclear. In addition to the heavy fog, the pilot lost the target and was unfamiliar with the navigation route, causing it to run aground on a shoal. The shipowner, upon learning of the accident, immediately ordered the ship to reverse twice, but it could not get out of danger. The ship was getting stuck deeper and deeper, and the hull tilted to the left, with river water entering. The crew and passengers immediately telegraphed a report. Soon, the Lianying Office dispatched the Beiyuan Steamer to rescue, and the cargo inside the ship was unloaded, totaling about 50 tons, mostly cigarettes, totaling more than 160 boxes. Two-thirds of the goods had been soaked in water. The crew and passengers then took the Chuyuan Steamer to Tianshenggang. Some of the passengers had their tickets refunded by the company and changed steamers themselves, and some were sent to Kou'an by the Chuyuan Steamer. The 96 crew members returned to Shanghai on the Da Steamer, arriving in Shanghai at 2:00 PM yesterday. The captain immediately reported to the company. The Chief Mate, Chief Engineer, and Business Director will determine whether to proceed with salvage. According to Guo Yuan, the manager of the company, the ship has a large hull, so it is currently under discussion. A proper solution will also be determined for the crew. The losses of the cargo will be handled by the Lianying Office.</p>

It is also reported that more than 150 people from our country's Naval Academy will also take the ship to England for liaison.</p>

<h3 id="e93">Ministry of Finance Responds to the City Council on Four Financial and Economic Measures <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>The municipal council suggested that the central government take various financial and economic measures. The Ministry of Finance has separately reviewed and replied to the matter. The relevant documents arrived at the council yesterday. The main points are recorded separately below: (1) Regarding the consolidation of banking business: (A) Recently, in order to encourage commercial firms to invest in production enterprises, the Central Bank supervised commercial firms to organize syndicates. For loans to small and medium-sized factories and export trade, they may apply to the Central Bank for re-mortgage or rediscount. Whether the fixed rate of ordinary deposit reserve should be reduced in Shanghai is under consideration. However, its reserve has been revised to be reduced to one-tenth, which will be returned to facilitate flexibility and payment. (B) The Ministry of Water Resources manages the bank, mainly to minimize or reduce highly coercive governance methods, and use economic methods to guide its strength, in order to seek the proper development of banking business.</p>
<p>(2) Regarding the adjustment of industrial funds: (A) Long-term low-interest loans for increasing production and assisting construction are the central task of the country. It has been actively handled for thousands of years, and it has achieved considerable results. (B) Factory loans are mortgaged with raw materials and finished products. The needs of the factory and the regulations of the bank can be taken into account. (C) Various agricultural loans (including water conservancy loans) are being implemented separately by the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Farmers Bank of China, according to the scheduled plan. (D) National loan procedures have also been urged to be simplified as much as possible. (E) The advantages and disadvantages of in-kind loans are mixed, and the continuation is also worthy of research. The Four Joint Offices are currently conducting in-depth research. (F) Regarding the organization of the Reconstruction Investment Company, the Shanghai industrial and commercial representatives made this suggestion when they came to Beijing to petition last time. After verification, the principle is feasible. (3) Regarding the development of international trade: (A) Whether the import and export chain system is appropriate under the current foreign exchange management method is worthy of research. The Ministry of Economic Affairs has gathered various agencies to discuss it, and believes that there are many concerns. 1. Importers may not also engage in exports, which violates the original purpose of the chain. 2. If only the amount is chained, it is still questionable whether this can limit imports. 3. If the total categories of goods are linked, most of what our country needs are machinery, cotton, and rice, while what should be encouraged to export are tea, tung oil, pig bristles, and agricultural products. There are concerns about forcing cotton exports, and it should be further considered. (B) Regarding the barter trade system, the Central Trust Bureau currently has a barter trade office, and the Ministry has sent a letter to inquire about it, and will reply later. (C) Regarding overseas markets, the husband is currently focusing on expanding. (D) The current commodity tax still follows the established rules of the general tax. Goods sold abroad can be refunded or exempted from tax, which has no impact on the development of international trade. (4) Regarding revitalizing the city's finances: (A) General land finance has been assigned to the Agricultural Bank of China. (B) The draft banking law stipulates that banks should dispose of real estate they own within one year. This real estate is received due to debt repayment. If it is not disposed of for a long time, it will make the bank's funds stagnant and lose the effect of flexible use, and one year is not short. (C) Using real estate as collateral to banks was originally a bad habit of the Shanghai banking industry. Under the current situation, it should be corrected to avoid fueling land speculation.</p>

<p>The Municipal Federation of Labor Unions held a banquet at the Meihua Restaurant on Nanjing Road at 6 PM last night for Mr. Thornton, Secretary of the British Textile Workers' Union, who was a labor representative of the British business delegation to China. Present were Yi Xiangyun, Chairman of the Federation of Labor Unions, Cheng Haifeng, Deputy Director of the China Branch of the International Labor Bureau, Zhang Peirong, representative of the Qingdao Textile Workers' Union, and more than 100 representatives of labor unions in the city. Yi Xiangyun delivered a welcome speech, briefly stating: The labor community in the city is very welcome to the British labor representatives who came to China to inspect. The British industry has a long history, and its industry and commerce are extremely developed. The intellectual level of workers is particularly advanced, which is worthy of our imitation. China and the United Kingdom should unite and cooperate. China is moving towards a democratic and free road and is striving to engage in industrial construction. Therefore, we hope that China and the United Kingdom can closely link up to promote world labor cooperation and human peace. Finally, I hope that the British industrial community can organize visiting groups to China from time to time, so that we can study each other, and I hope that Mr. Thornton will report on the situation of Chinese industry after returning to the UK and provide assistance from time to time. After the speech, Mr. Thornton stood up to give a reply, first expressing his gratitude for the warm hospitality, and then said that the British industrial community is very interested in the future development of Chinese industry, and has a very friendly feeling towards the Chinese labor community. China and the United Kingdom will also fight together, and now we should strive for cooperation and fight together for democracy and freedom, in order to promote the realization of world peace and human equality. The British trade union organization has a history of more than 100 years, and is very willing to sincerely assist the Chinese industrial community. I deeply hope that the Chinese trade union can become a responsible organization that seeks welfare for workers and strives to improve the lives of workers. China is in a very difficult period, and not only hopes that industrial problems can be resolved, but also hopes that political problems can be resolved as soon as possible. The banquet ended happily at about 9 o'clock.</p>
<h3 id="e95">Taiwan Sugar's Inventory is Still Abundant; Factory Restoration is Progressing Rapidly <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>Shen Zhennan Talks About His Trip to Taiwan After Returning to Shanghai</p>
<p>Shen Zhennan, General Manager of Taiwan Sugar Corporation, went to Taiwan on September 11 to inspect sugarcane planting and factory restoration. He flew back to Shanghai from Taiwan the day before yesterday afternoon at 2 o'clock. This morning, he will go to the capital to report to the Assets Committee on the progress of this trip and make some requests. After returning to Shanghai, he will stay for more than a week and will have to go to Taiwan again to arrange everything. According to Shen's conditions, the original plan of the company was to plant 90,000 Jia of sugarcane (16 mu per Jia). It started in July and has now completed 80%. Half of it is in Tainan, followed by Kaohsiung, and then Taichung. It is expected that the harvest in the following year can produce 300,000 tons of sugar. Regarding the sugarcane planting loans that assist sugarcane farmers, NT$600 million has been loaned out to date, stipulating NT$10,000 per Jia, with an interest rate of 7%, and will be fully recovered by the end of next year when the sugarcane is harvested. In order to encourage the interest of sugarcane farmers, the original sugarcane farmer's sugar sharing method was changed to settle the payment according to the sugar price at that time, with the farmers getting 48% and the company getting 52%. The sugar price is guaranteed at NT$25 per catty. If it rises sharply, it will be settled at the market price. As for factory restoration, the progress is rapid. If hardware and equipment can be transported quickly, then as many as 30 factories can be restored by the end of next year. The factory that will start work in January next year can reach 12, first using the sugarcane planted last year to make sugar. Unfortunately, this raw material was planted the year before under the direction of the Japanese, so the quality is not good. Fortunately, the current sugar reserves are abundant, which can be connected with the production in the following year, so there will be no shortage. As for the 4,000 Japanese technicians originally in the factories, 3,000 were sent away in April, and 900 more were recently sent back. 100 people were retained. Fortunately, our country's technicians have begun to be transferred and can be sent to serve. In the future, it will be sufficient and there will be no problem. Shen also said: The general living situation in Taiwan Province is not yet stable.</p>

<h3 id="e97">Otters that are Amphibious; Looks Like a Snake, Fox, and Mouse; Captured Alive in Western Zhejiang and Brought to Shanghai <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>"This newspaper reports" The people of Shanghai are truly fortunate. We just saw Miss Panda, and now we have the opportunity to appreciate the Otter Prince. However, the former has a grand momentum and is preparing to reciprocate the United States, while the latter was caught by a small farmer in a mountain village and is preparing to sell it at a good price. Fortunately, the director of Hengjingchang Fur Shop at No. 332 Henan Middle Road has a kind heart and kept it, and will transfer it to the city's zoo for display.</p>
<p>"Otter skin" is the pride of precious fur coats, and the "Otter Prince" is a delicate guest among animals. Its honor can be compared to many things, like a snake, a mouse, and a fox. To be specific, when it moves, it is as agile as a snake, when it forages, it is like a mouse, and when it shrugs its shoulders and walks wide, it is like a fox again. When it is full and resting, it refuses to be still, twisting its waist and playing with its tail, like a naughty monkey. Its toes are connected, indicating that it is also good at swimming.</p>
<p>The hometown of this prince is in Anji, western Zhejiang. There, the mountains and forests are dense, and the ponds are crisscrossed. When it was discovered by the villagers, it was practicing diving with its mother. In the dark night, the villagers suspected that "water ghosts" were causing trouble, so they launched a surprise attack. Its mother sacrificed under the ruthless knife, but it became a prisoner in the net. When it was first captured and brought to Shanghai, it only ate milk, but now it can gobble up small fish. It is said that it is particularly cunning and amphibious. For many years, it is still the first time it has been captured alive. It is now on display in Hengjingchang Fur Shop. For the sake of curiosity, ladies who have never seen the true face of an otter are worth visiting and appreciating. (Picture shows the true face of the otter on display)</p>

<p>The Shanghai Shipping Association, in order to improve the waterway military maintenance of various scheduled routes, previously appointed Secretary-General Li Yunliang and Hu Shiyuan, Deputy General Manager of the State-owned China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, to go to Beijing and report to Director Xi Enshui of the Transportation Department of the Joint Logistics Headquarters on various issues related to merchant ship supply for military use, and to discuss improvement plans, which were fully adopted by Director Xi. Now, General Commander Huang Zhenqiu of the Joint Logistics Headquarters has formulated the military transport ship chartering and delivery regulations based on this recommendation, and announced and implemented them under the Department Order No. Yunshui 13599. The above order arrived at various military transport agencies and shipping associations yesterday. Director Xi Enshui of the department came to Shanghai the day before yesterday to supervise the implementation of the improvement plan and to announce to the shipping industry the government's determination to improve waterway military transport, relieve the pain of shipping merchants, and specific steps. He has had a cordial conversation with Du Yuesheng, Chairman of the Association.</p>
<p>Comprehensive Consideration and Deep Appreciation</p>
<p>Du expressed his deep admiration for Director Xi's comprehensive consideration of military transport and general transport, and specially invited the responsible persons of various shipping companies to hold a grand welcome meeting at the Huizhong Hotel on the Bund, Nanjing Road at 6 PM yesterday. At the same time, he also welcomed Fu Wen, Commander of the First Supply Area, who was present, along with Director Liu Yaohan of the Shanghai Waterway Military Transport Office and more than ten others. On the shipping side, Shen Zhongyi, Hu Shiyuan, Deputy General Manager of the State-owned China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, Lu Yinggeng, General Manager of Datong Company, Cheng Yuqi, Manager of Zhongxing Company, Yang Guanbei, General Manager of Yixiang Company, Wei Wenhan, Chairman of Haiying Company, and representatives of more than 50 companies were present. Du Yuesheng, Chairman, delivered a welcome speech, expressing great enthusiasm and confidence in Director Xi and Commander Fu to improve the waterway military transport problem, bring waterway military transport to a new stage, and reduce the pain of the shipping industry by comprehensively considering military transport and general transport. He expressed his gratitude and deeply believed that in the future, they could further seek the revival and development of China's shipping industry by solving the waterway military transport problem.</p>
<p>Scheduled Liners, Maintain as Much as Possible</p>
<p>Then Director Xi and others gave speeches and discussed various issues in detail. Director Xi Enshui said: The military transport ship chartering and delivery regulations, which seek the opinions of the shipping association, have now been formally announced. For the chartering of ships in the future, ships owned by the state-owned China Merchants Steam Navigation Company will be the main ones. Ships that have been designated and approved by the government to undertake special tasks, such as ships designated to transport relief materials and public goods, and scheduled liners that maintain traffic on fixed routes, may be exempted from chartering except for emergency military transport. In addition, for chartered ships, the company or its agent shall be notified four to eight hours before the ship is used, except for emergency military transport. Ships that have been loaded with cargo and passengers shall not be forcibly chartered. Regarding the delivery method, the procedures for delivering military supplies are the same as those for commercial goods, and the freight is calculated at 80% of the third-class commercial freight rate. All payment methods shall be based on the principle of full payment before sailing. Xi also emphasized: Regarding the current difficulties faced by the shipping industry, the Joint Logistics Headquarters will adopt and improve in every way it can afford in terms of financial and human resources. It hopes to complete military transport through mutual cooperation.</p>

<h3 id="e101">Fight Triggered Under the Red Light; Eleven Policemen and Ticket Sellers Injured; Three Bus Lines Once Suspended <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>"This newspaper reports" At 6:30 PM last night, a temporary bus (Route No. 7) of the Municipal Bureau of Public Works was driving from the Bund to the intersection of Zhongzheng East Road and Henan Road. Because it ran a red light, the traffic police ordered it to stop and questioned the driver. However, the driver Xu Shunshi believed that the police were deliberately making trouble. Both sides held their own opinions and a dispute occurred. Finally, the traffic police took the driver to the Huangpu Police Station. At that time, the buses of various routes that came later learned about the previous situation and were indignant. They stopped running one after another, totaling more than 30 vehicles. All the drivers and ticket sellers, more than 100 people, gathered in front of the police station and demanded the immediate release of the driver. The situation was tense for a while, and the traffic there was also blocked. At about 8 o'clock, when traffic police officers Li Guangyu, No. 5916, and Yan Pengfei, No. 979, were leaving the station, they were discovered by the drivers and ticket sellers who gathered in the square and were beaten severely. When some police officers in the police station saw this situation, they also felt unfair, so a big fight broke out between the two sides. After Du, the chief of the branch, learned about it, he immediately sent police to put it down. However, in the conflict, police officers Li Guangyu, Yan Pengfei, and ticket sellers Ji Youguan, Sun Dingkun, Zhu Genquan, Jin Qihua, Gao Chongliang, Xu Renshi, Zhou Asan, Hu Wenlong, and Xu Sisheng were injured. Soon, the police station sent the injured to the police hospital and Renji Hospital for treatment. At this point, the situation had become serious. Fortunately, the preparatory office of the Public Bus Company of the Public Works Bureau also heard the news and quickly sent the preparatory director Wu Zhuozhi to investigate. On the one hand, he ordered the drivers and ticket sellers to resume work first, and on the other hand, he negotiated with the police station. It was not until 9:30 PM that the police station agreed to release the driver, and the storm was resolved. Li Guangyu, Yan Pengfei, Ji Youguan, and Sun Dingkun were seriously injured and hospitalized for treatment. The rest were bandaged and discharged from the hospital.</p>
<h3 id="e102">Secretary-General of the Korean Delegation Receives Reporters to Report on the Current Situation in Korea, Appeals for Sino-Korean Friendship, and Asks for Understanding of the Actions of a Few Bad Elements <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>"This newspaper reports" Kim Eun-chung, Secretary-General of the Korean Delegation, recently came to China to be responsible for Sino-Korean liaison matters. He recently made a trip to Beijing. After returning to Shanghai, he received the city's press corps at 2:00 p.m. yesterday to report on the current situation in Korea and emphasized the importance of friendly Sino-Korean relations. Mr. Kim first stated the aspects of Korean history, geography, culture, religion, and customs that are related to China. Then, in terms of economics, education, and politics, he reported on the current situation in Korea, stating: (1) The economic situation is quite chaotic because, after the Yalta Conference agreement, the 38th parallel became the dividing line, and materials between the North and South are separated. It is said that some people cannot solve their livelihood problems, and riots have occurred. Although there have also been bloody incidents in the South, the general situation is better. The U.S. military is using materials and grain to provide relief, but the people still oppose trusteeship and hope for independence. (2) In education, since Japan's surrender, all enslaving education has been completely eliminated. Since December of last year, pure culture has been fully restored. At present, young Koreans do not understand Chinese because they have lived under Japanese rule for too long, but it is estimated that more than 80% of the 27 million people can speak Chinese. The most popular writing in the country is also a combination of Chinese and Korean, that is, part Chinese and part Korean. The current education system is also similar to that of China. More than 98% of schools have Chinese courses, and all teachers have a good understanding and knowledge of China and teach voluntarily. (3) The political problem is not as complicated as imagined. Although there are many political parties in the country, they can all understand that seeking the country's independence is the top priority. The four major parties in the South, the Independence Party, the Democratic Party, the People's Party, and the Communist Party, have recently united to form a joint party headquarters. The "Political Education and Economic Equalization System" advocated by the Independence Party has been unanimously approved by the four parties and has implemented land redistribution. The original People's Committee in the North has been reorganized into the New People's Party and has also implemented land redistribution. What is not used is that the South implements unconditional recovery. Recently, both the North and South have begun to connect closely to seek the country's independence and freedom together.</p>
<p>Finally, Mr. Kim repeatedly emphasized that China and Korea should work closely together. He said that China and Korea are like childhood friends. The two countries only have related interests and no conflicting interests. However, due to Japan's long-term occupation in the past, a few bad people have forgotten their roots over time and committed crimes in China, causing a bad impression. Since the end of the war, China has treated Korean and Japanese expatriates and prisoners of war the same, resulting in many honest people being deported back to their countries and falling into difficulties. Recently, there have been reports of anti-Chinese sentiment in Korea, which has led to retaliatory actions against Korean expatriates in some parts of China. This situation has a negative impact on Sino-Korean relations. It is hoped that everyone will recognize the importance of friendly Sino-Korean relations. The behavior of a few bad people cannot represent the entire population. The real Koreans are willing to be friends with China. At the same time, it is hoped that the Chinese government will distinguish between good and bad Korean expatriates and treat them differently. Korea has already occupied the right timing, and the Soviet Union has occupied the geographical advantage. China must strive for harmony among the people. Recently, the Korean delegation has drafted concrete measures to improve Sino-Korean relations and suggested to the Chinese government: (1) Provide loans to more than 2 million Korean expatriate farmers in Northeast China. (2) Relax the standards for Korean expatriate property. (3) Shorten the war criminal trial period. (4) Restore Sino-Korean transportation and trade, etc. In addition, Korean veterans have established the Sino-Korean Friendship Association in Seoul to protect overseas Chinese.</p>

<h3 id="e104">The Poorer the Family, the More Children They Have; Talking to Them About Birth Control is Like Playing the Lute to a Cow; Health Pharmaceutical Association Plans to Restore Guidance Work <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>"This newspaper reports" The China Health Pharmaceutical Association on Chi Bang Road in this city plans to restore the birth control guidance center in the near future to seek welfare for women who have given birth too many times or whose physical strength is not up to par. Before the war, there was the establishment of the "Shanghai Birth Control Research Society" in the medical and pharmaceutical circles of this city. During the war, it was virtually suspended due to the dispersal of members.</p>
<p>According to Dr. Huang Huaibei, director of the Health Pharmaceutical Association, it is almost impossible to universally implement birth control in China, because even in progressive countries in Europe and the United States, although many people advocate it, they should not practice birth control. As for the situation in China, the people have lower knowledge, and often the poorer the family, the more children they have. Talking to them about birth control is like "playing the lute to a cow." Furthermore, the method of birth control is nothing more than the use of tools. Those used by men are quite inconvenient for physiology, while those used by women are expensive and cannot be afforded by poor families. Therefore, although the association plans to restore the birth control guidance center, there is no far-reaching promotion plan, but only to provide medical guidance for those who have given birth too much or whose physical strength is weak.</p>
<p>In addition, the China Health Pharmaceutical Association has now piloted the "News Public Health Experimental Zone." In addition to handling the actual outpatient work of medical treatment, it also focuses on preventive work such as health education, family visits, and physical examinations. Its blood transfusion service department is the only organization in this city. There are currently 72 specially contracted blood donors who regularly supply blood to 12 hospitals in Shanghai. Recently, the association will also hold an advanced nurse training class, and free physical examinations for healthy children are held every Wednesday afternoon.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Branch of China Travel Service has opened an overseas group at 50 Ningbo Road, Shanghai Commercial &amp; Savings Bank, starting from the 25th of this month to facilitate overseas travelers. It specializes in selling overseas ship and plane tickets, handling overseas travel procedures, and selling traveler's checks.</p>
<p>"This newspaper reports" The China Musical Theater, sponsored by Madame Chiang, specially invited the city's press corps at 12:00 p.m. yesterday to the Shanghai First Reception Center of the Lizhi Society at 2004 West Nanjing Road because it will be performing in Shanghai soon. First, Huang Renlin, the general secretary of the Lizhi Society, reported on the grand occasion of the troupe's public performance in Nanjing earlier this month and said that the chairman and his wife greatly praised it. When "Meng Jiangnu" was performed, Chairman Chiang watched the play twice; and "Bo Guang Qin Xin" was performed once, for a total of three times. Madame Chiang, during the rehearsal of the two plays, had already hired Mr. and Mrs. Heishuai, Tiecheng, Song Ziwen, Chen Cheng and other five people as consultants, and followed Madame Chiang's request to hire Dr. Mei Lanfang as a consultant. Huang met with Dr. Mei yesterday, and Mei readily agreed.</p>
<p>Then, Deng Shiping, Madame Chiang's representative and the current general manager of the troupe, introduced the troupe's composer and director, Aifu Xia Lomuf, saying that Mr. Aifu (the name by which people in the country referred to Aifu Xia Lomuf) grew up in Siberia in his childhood. Because the natural geography is close to the Chinese border, he has loved Chinese music since he was a child and is determined to explore its essence. His parents forced him to study medicine, but Mr. Aifu was willing to be a traitor to his family and went to the Swiss Conservatory of Music for further study. He then came to China and has been painstakingly studying the essence of Chinese medicine for 30 years. His works that have been staged include "Meng Jiangnu", "Bo Guang Qin Xin", "Ancient Temple Turtle Dream", and "Five Planets". His unfinished works include "Wife Concubine" and "Phoenix".</p>
<p>Aifu Xia Lomuf then gave a speech, saying that in his 30 years of musical work, he only knew that expressing emotions was the only goal. However, after admitting that his wife sponsored him this time, he realized his own mission, excellent tradition, and extremely high attainments. With forbearance and strategy, my goal is to use the essence of Chinese national music through Western instruments to give full play to it.</p>
<p>The China Musical Theater is scheduled to perform "Meng Jiangnu" at the Nanjing Great Theater on December 5, 6, 7, and 8. The ticket prices are 50,000 yuan (honorary medical ticket), 20,000 yuan, and 10,000 yuan. The play "Meng Jiangnu" was performed in "Guangxin" and was well received by the general public. After this public performance, it will go to the United States as soon as there is an opportunity to raise funds for the relief of refugee children.</p>

<p>"This newspaper reports" Chen Xueping, director of the Zhabei Police Sub-bureau, was suspected of concealing and selling enemy property, 550 dozen enameled washbasins, and 340 iron bars from the Yatie Factory in October last year. At the same time, Huang Jianxiong, administrative section chief, employees Fang Xifan and Zhu Shuyuan, and businessman Shuang Dechang of the sub-bureau were involved. The local court sentenced Chen Xueping to seven years in prison, acquitted Shuang Dechang, and sentenced Fang and Zhu to six months in prison. Chen and others were dissatisfied with the judgment and filed an appeal. After the Chamber of Commerce reviewed the case, Chen Xueping and others denied the charges against them. The judge believed that further investigation was necessary, and Shuang Dechang, who was acquitted in the original judgment, was also considered to have significant suspicions. The three guarantors of the Jiaogu Shop were required to provide three guarantees or 50 million yuan in cash, but since there was neither shop guarantee nor cash, the case was temporarily detained and rescheduled for retrial.</p>

<h3 id="e109">The Local Court Clarifies the Dispute Over House Donations: If There Are Provisions in the Lease, They Should Be Bound By It, But This Agreement Has No Effect Against Tax Authorities <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>[This newspaper reports] Since the implementation of the new method of collecting house donations in this city, landlords and tenants have immediately started disputes. Because the current house donation collection method is based on the actual rent of the house, 20% of the rent is borne by the landlord, and the household is responsible for paying it on behalf of the landlord first, and then using it to offset the rent. However, the landlord and the household often stipulate in the lease that all donations and taxes shall be paid by the tenant and have nothing to do with the landlord, so that the household often refuses to pay after paying the donation, and the dispute arises from this. The Finance Bureau believed that this matter involved legal issues and had sent a letter to the Shanghai Local Court for a clear explanation. It is reported that the Local Court has replied to the Finance Bureau, roughly requesting: If the lessor and the lessee stipulate in the lease that "all donations and taxes shall be paid by the lessee and have nothing to do with the lessor", both parties shall be bound by it, but this kind of special agreement has no effect against the tax authorities.</p>

<p>Wu Yunzhai, chairman of the pseudo-Xinwen Bao, had been tried by the High Court before, and yesterday was the date of sentencing. At 9:00 a.m., the gallery was crowded with relatives and friends of the defendant's family, and Mr. and Mrs. Qian Xin-zhi also arrived on time to listen. At 9:30, Liu Yugui, the president of the High Court, and the two judges, Cao and Qiu, ascended the court. The defendant was escorted by bailiffs, wearing a dark blue robe, a black velvet hat, and gold-rimmed glasses. He looked dejected. After asking his age and origin, President Liu stood up and read the main text of the judgment: "Wu Yunzhai, conspiring with the enemy and conspiring to rebel against the country, is sentenced to two years and six months of imprisonment and deprived of his civil rights for two years. All property shall be confiscated except for the necessary living expenses for the family." He continued: "The defendant's sentence of two years and six months is a lenient sentence, because the defendant was found to have assisted in the war of resistance, sheltered underground work, and has been proven by Jiang Bocheng, Du Yuesheng, and Qian Xin-zhi. However, the pseudo-Xinwen Bao was sponsored by the enemy's naval reporting department. In legal terms, the defendant is sentenced according to the crime he deserves." After hearing the sentence, Wu repeatedly said that he was not satisfied and said that he would apply for a retrial. Then he requested the court to allow him to meet with his family, and the request was granted. When the defendant was talking with his family, Qian Xin-zhi also went to reminisce with him for about four minutes, and then he was escorted back by the bailiffs. The following were also sentenced at the same time: (1) Zhang Lou-tong, sentenced to three years of imprisonment and deprived of his civil rights for three years. (2) Zhang Liansheng, sentenced to two years and six months of imprisonment and deprived of his civil rights for two years. The property of the above two traitors shall be confiscated according to law.</p>
<h3 id="e111">Sun Chunsheng Vehemently Denies Fundraising and Dedicating Aircraft by Relying on Enemy Power <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>[This newspaper reports] Sun Chunsheng, a real estate tycoon, served as the executive director and secretary-general of the pseudo-Shanghai Real Estate Association and the Chinese manager of the Enemy Trust Real Estate Co., Ltd. during the period when Shanghai was occupied by the enemy. He was suspected of relying on enemy power to solicit donations of 225,000 yuan in pseudo-currency from various colleagues as "aircraft dedication". After the victory, Sun was arrested in Shanghai by the Songhu Garrison Headquarters under the order of the Ministry of National Defense and sent to the High Prosecutor's Office for investigation and prosecution. The case was heard in the High Court yesterday afternoon. Sun confessed that he was 48 years old, from Yuyao, Zhejiang, and lived at 180 Dunxin Road. In the early years of the Republic of China, he worked in the English Commercial Guang Company. Because of a house dispute, he met Japanese lawyer Okamoto Otsu. In the 19th year of the Republic of China, he transferred from Ye Guang Company to Trust Real Estate Co., Ltd., where Okamoto Otsu was the general manager and director. After the outbreak of the Anti-Japanese War, he repeatedly wanted to resign, but he was threatened by the enemy constitution and never succeeded. The scope of "Trust Exchange" was very small, only collecting rent for customers, etc., and there was nothing that would harm the people of the country. He resigned in the 31st year of the Republic of China. The pseudo-Real Estate Association was formed in July of the 32nd year of the Republic of China under the threat of the pseudo-Economic Bureau. At that time, more than 100 colleagues participated, and the defendant was elected as the executive director by their vote. Then the directors and supervisors appointed him as the secretary-general, and the chairman was Zhu Boquan. In March of the 33rd year of the Republic of China, a "Shanghai Citizens' Aircraft Dedication Campaign Committee letter and an invitation letter from the "Mayor" Chen Gongbo were sent to the association. The board of directors and supervisors decided that it was appropriate not to participate, and Chen Gongbo's banquet was not attended. It is even more unheard of to solicit donations of 225,000 yuan for the dedication of aircraft. The court ordered that the case still needs to be investigated and rescheduled for retrial, and the defendant was sent back to prison.</p>

<p>Pan Lizhi, a German Jew, was accused of colluding with the enemy Japan. In the 29th year of the Republic of China, the enemy controlled the administrative power of the Shanghai Public Concession. Fearing that the number of votes of overseas Chinese was insufficient, Pan Lizhi wanted to take the opportunity to show his loyalty and ran around for the enemy Japan, wooing German Jewish refugees to join the vote. In the 31st year, the Pacific War broke out, and the enemy entered the concession. Pan Lizhi was re-appointed by the enemy navy to set up an agency at the Cathay Hotel. Under the command of the enemy Zhitian, he secretly reviewed relevant British documents and broadcast in German every day to promote for the enemy. He also strongly supported the pro-Japanese Shanghai Jewish newspaper and prevented the publication of other newspapers that were beneficial to our country. After the victory, Changju detained him and sent him to the High Prosecutor's Office for investigation and prosecution. When the defendant was tried in the High Court yesterday, he denied that he had worked as an intelligence officer in the enemy's special agency, and he did not participate in the election activities of the Public Concession at that time, saying that he was the manager of the European Refugee Assistance International Committee and was in charge of the association affairs in Shanghai. However, Mrs. Annes came to court and testified that the defendant did indeed work as an intelligence officer at the enemy Naval Marine Corps Zhitian, and the court ordered a retrial at a later date.</p>

<p>(This newspaper reports) Wu Suiren, a clerk in the accounting section of the General Affairs Office, used his position to embezzle 2.7 billion yuan of the General Affairs Office's September funds for lending. After the authorities discovered this case on October 28, Wu expressed his repentance and returned all 2.7 billion yuan of public funds, including the 14.6 million yuan in interest. Although the General Affairs Office did not suffer any losses, Wu Suiren's embezzlement of public funds violated criminal law. Therefore, Huo Baoshu, director of the General Affairs Office, sent the entire case to the Local Procuratorate on the 16th of this month for handling in accordance with the law. The prosecutor in charge of the Local Procuratorate issued a detention warrant yesterday morning and sent bailiffs to Wu Suiren's residence at 2 Ruifengli, East Jiaxing Road, North Sichuan Road, Hongkou, to arrest him. Liu Yongzhi, the prosecutor, opened the court for interrogation immediately. Wu directly admitted the embezzlement of public funds, but the actual amount released was 1.4 billion yuan, which was entrusted to someone to discount.

<p>[This newspaper reports] The distribution group of the Post-Relief Work Planning Committee organized by the Shanghai Branch of the General Affairs Office held a meeting the day before yesterday and decided that in the future, the distribution of post-relief materials to various agencies and businesses must be obtained through the distribution method stipulated by the General Office of the General Affairs Office. However, the materials should be studied and utilized by the Post-Relief Work Planning Committee to ensure that each distribution can better meet actual needs and benefit the public, so as to avoid falling into the hands of merchants and hoarding. The association also stipulates three methods for applying for materials: (1) Apply to the General Office for materials based on the application form, (2) Apply to the General Office for materials based on the materials found by the Shanghai Branch that meet the needs, (3) Apply to the General Office for materials based on the distribution material list of the General Office that meet the needs. (This application is made by the Branch to the Joint Distribution Committee of the General Affairs Office to formulate a distribution material list for post-relief and send it to the Work Planning Committee, giving the Committee the priority to study and utilize it within two weeks).</p>

<p>In addition, the distribution group of the association decided to send a letter directly to the Shanghai Branch for approval of the case of the Municipal Works Bureau proposing to dredge the rivers in the suburbs and requesting the allocation of flour for subsidies, because the case is related to work relief.</p>
<p>The committee also went to the Zhenru General Affairs Office Machine Factory to investigate the machines in the factory that are suitable for the use of the two bureaus, and will apply to the Shanghai Branch and then to the General Affairs Office for approval. The committee believes that the current seamen's strike prevents materials from being transported to China, so the work can only focus on planning. Once the materials are unimpeded in the coming spring, concrete work can be carried out actively.</p>

The Procuratorate has now concluded the investigation and believes that there are indeed major crimes and has filed a public prosecution.</p>

<p>The sales of woolen fabrics have seen a resurgence yesterday in tea houses, markets, and chess board street wholesale stores, as merchants replenish stocks. Popular items such as overcoat wool, Melton, thick wool, camel hair, and long-haired fleece are selling well in both retail and wholesale. Women's suiting wool, worsted, thick serge, gabardine, and cavalry twill are also in demand. Due to the cold weather, winter sales are increasing. However, prices remain stable due to sufficient market supply, with minimal fluctuations. Sellers, aware of the risks associated with high-profit goods and credit sales, are generally willing to accept lower prices for cash.</p>
<p>Business Tax: Currency Exchange Industry Requests Assessment Based on Capital</p>
<p>Previously, when the business tax for the currency exchange industry in this city was collected by the Direct Taxation Bureau of the Ministry of Finance, it was assessed based on capital, similar to banks. Now that the business tax has been transferred to local collection, the Municipal Finance Bureau has adjusted the collection method and switched to assessing the currency exchange industry based on turnover. The industry argues that the market prices of foreign currencies, stocks, and other assets fluctuate greatly, sometimes multiple times in a single day. Current business is slow, and many businesses are struggling to survive. Therefore, the association has submitted a document to the Finance Bureau, detailing the industry's operating conditions and requesting that the tax assessment remain based on capital. Otherwise, the burden will be unsustainable.</p>

<p>Cotton Yarn Allocation Committee Resolution: Factories to Provide Production and Sales Statistics; Replenishment to Utilize Certificate-Based Yarn Distribution System</p>
<p>[Our Report] The Cotton Yarn Allocation Committee held its fifth meeting at the City Government Conference Room yesterday afternoon at approximately 3:00 PM. Attendees included Mr. Wu Guozhen, Chairman of the Textile Control Committee, and committee members Wu Weijing, Wang Qiyu, Tong Runfu, and Liu Jingji (representing Liu Zhengji). Representatives from various replica product associations, including Pan Shihao, Xu Zhaohou, Wang Bingjun, Ren Bingdao, Ni Gengping, Xu Zixin, and Li Daofa, and representatives from the Yarn Merchant Association, including Tang Zhiliang, Zhou Jiasheng, and Shen Boqin, were also present. Mr. Wang Qiyu first reported on the fourth situation of the third period of cotton yarn allocation, followed by Chairman Wu's statement that the first priority for cotton yarn allocation should be the needs of self-operated weaving, and the second priority should be the needs of the replica industry. The allocation of yarn numbers and yarn shipped to other regions should be the third and fourth priorities. The discussion then began and adjourned at approximately 5:00 PM. The important resolutions are listed as follows: (1) Each yarn mill should compile statistics on the types and quantities of cotton yarn produced, based on the actual production situation before the implementation of the allocation system, and submit them to the Textile Control Committee's regular meeting yesterday (28th). (2) Each replica product association should compile statistics on the types and quantities of cotton yarn required and submit them to the Textile Control Committee for discussion, in order to coordinate with the yarn numbers supplied by the various yarn mills. (3) The replica product associations often complain that the yarn numbers are not suitable and that the payment dates are limited. In order to improve this, it is proposed to adopt a certificate-based yarn distribution system. Each month, 24,000 pieces of yarn will be allocated. First, each replica product association will allocate the required yarn numbers, and the allocation committee will distribute yarn allocation certificates to each replica factory. Each replica factory can use the certificate to purchase the required yarn numbers from any yarn mill within one month. (4) The Yarn Merchant Association should report the daily quantity of cotton yarn purchased and sold and the customers to the Textile Control Committee. Private factories should submit a list of cotton yarn sold to each yarn number to the Textile Control Committee and the Yarn Merchant Association for verification. (5) The cotton yarn received by the Yarn Merchant Association from each factory should be centrally allocated, with 1,500 pieces prioritized for retailers. The replica product associations, the cotton yarn distribution factories, and the Yarn Merchant Association held separate meetings last night to prepare materials for discussion at today's Textile Control Committee meeting.</p>
<p>Coal Prices Fluctuate, Ultimately Rise Above Previous Market Levels</p>
<p>The coal market saw a continuation of rising prices on Monday, but public associations advised against further speculation and set a deadline for all joint venture delivery orders to be cleared by the end of the month, leading to cautious selling and a quick market correction. On Tuesday, strong demand from end users absorbed the price drop, and the market recovered. On Wednesday, end users, anticipating difficulty returning to old prices, boosted prices to a new high.</p>
<p>42-Count Yarn Reaches New High, 20-Count Yarn Requires Premium; Spot Goods Scarce, Textile Construction Offers Over a Thousand Pieces</p>
<p>[Our Report] Yesterday's yarn market saw transactions at limited prices, mainly Jianzi yarn from Textile Construction and Double Happiness 10-count yarn from Shenxin. Due to high black market prices, the selling side traded 20-count yarn at limited prices, but an extra premium was inevitable. There was no allocation of 42-count yarn, creating a serious shortage. Prices were as high as 4.56 million outside the market, but no sellers were available. Textile Construction listed yarn for sale in the morning, ranging from 6 to 80 count, totaling 1,001 pieces and 30 small packages, which were allocated to 630 members of the Yarn Merchant Association. The number of pieces of each yarn count included 37 pieces of 6-count Sunlight Deputy brand, 86 pieces of 12-count Sunlight, 488 pieces of 20-count Baoguang, 82 pieces of 20-count Lihma, 152 pieces of 32-count Sunlight cone yarn, 136 pieces of 32-count Yanghe cone yarn, 2 pieces of 60-count double-strand unbranded cone yarn, 1 piece of 80-count double-strand unbranded cone yarn, and 17 and 3/4 pieces of 80-count three-strand colored ball. The prices for each yarn count can be found in this newspaper's market price list. Although these quantities were purchased by members of the Yarn Merchant Association, there was still a shortage of the popular 20-count Baoguang brand. Textile companies in the six districts petitioned the Textile Control Committee to change the sales location due to the small size of the association's premises. The Textile Control Committee approved that each factory would open yarn sales at its own distribution location at limited prices.</p>
<p>Low Cotton Inventory; Indian Cotton Expected</p>
<p>The cotton market is showing signs of rising prices in producing areas, but transactions are limited. Only 100 bales of White Low Grade were traded. According to the Cotton Industry Association, current cotton inventory in Shanghai is around 100,000 bales, with Chinese cotton accounting for only one-fifth. Chinese cotton sales have been slow due to high costs, transportation fees, and heavy taxes, making it difficult to compete with American cotton.</p>
<p>Before May 13th of this year, Shanghai manufacturers ordered a total of approximately 110,000 bales of cotton from India. However, the Indian government subsequently banned cotton exports, rendering these orders invalid. Recently, the Indian government approved the export of this batch of Indian cotton, and yesterday sent a telegram to Shanghai trading firms stating that an import license must be submitted for inspection before export.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Cotton Industry Association has decided to broadcast the daily cotton market prices in Shanghai on the Shanghai Radio Station every day from 6:00 PM starting next month (December 1st).</p>
<p>Fine Cloth and Serge Most in Demand</p>
<p>The cotton cloth market remains strong, especially for fine cloth and serge. The limited sale of green Textile Construction fine cloth has created a severe shortage in the market, attracting dyeing and weaving factories. Sales to customers are also good. 5005 bleached cloth rose sharply by 4,000 yuan, and various brands of Burmese cloth rose again by 1,500 to 2,500 yuan. Four Gentlemen and Golden Seal serge rose by 3,500 yuan, and various grades of serge also rose by 1,500 to 2,000 yuan. However, dark blue Shilin An'an cloth and twill cloth did not perform well but remained expensive.</p>
<p>New Land and Mainland Distribution Offices Relocated</p>
<p>The New Land Cotton Weaving Factory, established in 1921 by Pan Shihao and others, is located at 300 Jiangsu East Road with a capital of 100,000 yuan. The capital increased to 8 million yuan in May of this year. Its products include New Land woolen fabric, 99 flannel, New Land poplin, and New Venus woolen fabric, with monthly sales reaching over 1,400 rolls. According to Manager Pan, the factory originally had 46 looms and plans to order 50 more from abroad to expand production. Its distribution office relocated to 210 Fujian Middle Road yesterday, and the distribution office of its affiliated Mainland Dyeing and Weaving Factory also relocated at the same time.</p>

According to a merchant here, two commercial ships from Hong Kong are expected to arrive today, carrying approximately 4,000 barrels of caustic soda. In total, approximately 10,000 barrels have recently arrived, which is sufficient for current needs.</p>
<p>American Cotton Rises</p>
<p>[United Press, New York, 26th] Today's cotton market rose sharply due to purchases by yarn mills, exceeding $2 per bale at one point, but later retreated slightly due to profit-taking. The market remained strong due to a shortage of spot goods and strong demand from weaving mills. Futures closed up 35 cents to $1.30 per bale. New Orleans also reported that today's cotton market rose across the board due to reports of a shortage of spot goods, stimulating buyers. Futures closed up 25 cents to $1.50 per bale.</p>
<p>Imported Pine Market Active</p>
<p>Yesterday, the lumber market saw strong demand for imported pine due to the need for bridges and roads. Chinese fir remained stable.</p>
<p>Americans Predict Price Drops Next Year</p>
<p>[Reuters, New York, 26th] Americans generally expect the price of building materials to fall by 20% and consumer goods by 30% in 1947. However, a return to pre-war price levels will not occur until 1948 or later. Labor unions appear to be changing their demands for wage increases, which would halt rising production costs and restore investor interest.</p>
<p>American Production Reaches Peak This Year</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 26th] The Production Management Agency said that American goods production has reached its peak since the Japanese surrender. While further increases are unlikely, 1947 could be a very good year if certain conditions are met.</p>
<p>Rice Market Continues Weak; Oil Prices Fall Sharply</p>
<p>The supply of rice from the north and south slightly decreased, totaling nearly 10,000 shih. However, shop demand is weak, and the market has been sluggish for a long time. Southern japonica rice continued to plummet by 2,000-3,000 yuan, and northern japonica rice also fell by 1,000-2,000 yuan. Glazed rice followed with a small decline of 1,000 yuan. White Yuanzhong rice also fell by 1,000-2,000 yuan, and Yin Yuan rice flooded the market, continuing to fall by 2,000-3,000 yuan. Buyers are scarce. Flour digestion is also slow, and prices are gradually decreasing, falling another 100-200 yuan with little optimism. The oil market has recently seen shipments from the Northeast, Tianjin, Hankou, and Bengbu, causing local stores to become cautious. The crude oil market is depressed, soybean oil fell by 2,000-3,000 yuan, and rapeseed oil, sesame oil, and clear oil all fell sharply by 3,000-5,000 yuan. Soybean cake demand turned weak, falling a small amount of 1,000-2,000 yuan. Soybean oil mills in various ports and this city have weak buying appetite, falling by 300-500 yuan. Wheat is scarce and stable. Corn has slight activity in Qingdao, and the market is firm. Red sorghum wineries are stagnant, falling another 1,000 yuan. Red beans are flat, mung beans from Southeast Asia continue to be procured and the situation is lively. Sesame from Guangdong slightly moved and has recovered, adding 1,000 yuan.</p>
<p>The allocation of edible oil in this city has already begun since the establishment of the Joint Allocation Office. It is understood that the goods were shipped yesterday, with over 300 dan allocated to the Central District and the Southern and Northern Shanghai districts. The allocated edible oil can be sold openly by retailers starting today at 1,200 yuan per shijin, without quantity restrictions.</p>
<p>Goods Tax Bureau: Approves Tea Tax Amount; Some Tea Merchants Request Exemption for Stored Tea</p>

The costs of warehousing and management over the years have been substantial. The tea industry is on the verge of bankruptcy. Moreover, the law should not be retroactive. Therefore, the association has requested, on behalf of all its members, that they be exempted from paying supplementary taxes in order to survive.</p>
<p>Tea Market Outlook Bleak</p>
<p>Recently, the tea market in this city has been sluggish. Due to stingy offers from overseas, export traders have become less interested. As for domestic sales, local stores and merchants have become less willing to stock up. It is also said that the colored teas that were shipped from this city before February have not yet been sold out, so inquiries are even more scarce. The overall trend is generally leaning towards a bleak outlook.</p>
<p>Taiwan Sugar Continues to Soften</p>
<p>The sugar market weakened further yesterday as the Taiwan Sugar Corporation's auction date approached.

<p>Ministry of Education Orders Five National Universities to Establish Philosophy Departments</p>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 27th] According to a responsible official of the Ministry of Education today, the Ministry of Education has ordered five national universities to establish philosophy departments within one year in order to "cultivate great thinkers." The five universities include Nankai University, Yingshi University, Anhui University, Zhejiang University, and Hunan University. However, Hunan University's philosophy department was previously established. It is claimed that lecturers in the philosophy department must have contributed to the development of domestic philosophical thought. While China needs engineers, economists, chemists, agriculturalists, and industrial talents to complete the massive post-war reconstruction work, healthy thinkers will be even more necessary because they can spiritually rejuvenate the nation. In addition, the Ministry of Education has ordered National Guizhou University to add a geology department this year. Guizhou's complex terrain is ideal for geological research. According to government experts, the province has abundant underground mineral resources.</p>

<p>Three Approaches to Cultural and Educational Organization Work: American Representative Expresses Views</p>
<p>[US Information Service, Paris, 26th] The committees of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) General Conference are currently discussing the work plan of cultural and educational organizations, and the delegations have commented on the organization's work policy. Mr. McCreesh, the American representative, said at the first meeting of the Planning Committee yesterday that the United States believes that cultural and educational organizations can fully promote their work through the following three approaches: (1) Act as an encouraging institution to stimulate or facilitate all scientific, educational, and artistic activities to promote international cooperation. (2) Act as a service institution to provide global cultural and scientific information to member states. (3) Act as a working institution to implement various programs to eliminate the crisis of understanding that harms the people of the world. He said that the American representative deeply felt that "For any suggestion related to the cultural and educational organization's plan, the primary question we should ask is whether this suggestion will contribute to the established goal, which is 'to promote international cooperation through education, science, and culture, thereby promoting peace and security.'" McCreesh continued: "In any case, the American delegation also believes that the first year should include some important and realistic work, which will open the door for the cultural and educational organization and will show the people of all countries that the work recommended by the cultural and educational organization is indeed urgently needed."</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Paris, 27th] The Construction and Post-War Committee of the United Nations Education Conference has now amended and adopted the six construction and repatriation plans proposed by the organization's preparatory committee. The content is: (1) Relief fund, relief supplies or strengthened activities for relief work. (2) Publishing single-page brochures, charts and newsletters on the activity. (3) Granting elected leaders in disaster areas researcher qualifications and letting them go abroad for research. (4) Hiring qualified consultants and experts from countries less affected by disasters, so as to discuss the work in the disaster areas. (5) Establishing youth service centers in important areas, so as to use international student groups to engage in reconstruction work. (6) Storing funds for emergency activities. In today's Committee on the Burden of Committee, the Chinese representative commented on the "Strengthening of Aid to China Movement" proposed by others, saying: "The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization should not only collect and disseminate information on the requirements put forward by various poor countries, but also adjust supply and demand at any time. The Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization should urge donor countries to pay attention to the most recent and urgent materials and work, and ensure the fair distribution of these relief materials."</p>

<p>A Petite and Exquisite Record of Suzhou in Spring and Autumn</p>
<p>By Zhao Qingge</p>
<p>Having returned from Hangzhou, I actually toured Suzhou once more. This was entirely due to my cousin's persistence; she had asked me countless times, and I had agreed countless times. Like a debt owed, it was only after a year that I finally repaid it. However, the fleeting visit only added to our mutual melancholy.</p>
<p>Twelve autumns have passed since I last bid farewell to Suzhou. Revisiting this old place today, my mind retains only fragmented and blurred traces of dreams! No matter how hard I try to recall, I can only vaguely remember the mood of that time from the remaining impressions of some scenic spots.</p>
<p>Leaving the house for the Lingering Garden, I found it a desolate and overgrown place! The pavilions and towers were dilapidated, almost like the Liu Manor I saw in Hangzhou. I truly wonder why the government pays so little attention and makes no effort to repair such scenic areas already designated for public enjoyment. Are they so reluctant to spend even a small amount on repairs? I don't understand.</p>
<p>From the Lingering Garden to Tiger Hill, the road is paved with yellow mud, wide but uneven. Sitting in a rickshaw without pneumatic tires, pulled by a coolie without cushioned seat covers, every step brought a jolt, shaking your backside painfully. Upon reaching the mountain gate, after climbing a slope not even half as steep as the Zhangjia Garden in Chongqing, we arrived at what they called the summit. At the summit stood the Tiger Hill Pagoda, built of stone. From afar, it looked quite beautiful, but up close, it was simply a pile of mud in ruins. A clear stream flowed below the mountain, called "Sword Pond." Nearby were historical sites such as the "Nodding Stone," said to be where a monk once preached, and even the stubborn rocks were so moved that they nodded in agreement. Because I loved this story, I even took a photo with these stubborn rocks twelve years ago. This time, I took another photo there. I hope that one day I will also discover a great, world-awakening truth here, so that this stubborn rock of mine can also nod in agreement!</p>
<p>When leaving Tiger Hill, I turned back with every step, feeling unusually lost, as if searching for vanished footprints or gradually capturing memories. I occasionally bent down to pick up a few newly fallen red leaves, and my fingers instantly felt a surge of heat, a surge of blood! I kissed the red leaves and quietly said goodbye!</p>
<p>One dusky evening, I savored the scenery of Lion Grove Garden. Of all the scenic spots in Suzhou, I love Lion Grove Garden the most. Although it also showed signs of neglect, it was still better than the others. One could see that the engineer who designed this garden had a very high level of artistic cultivation. Whether it was a tree, a stone, a bridge, a pavilion, or a row of pink walls, everything was arranged so exquisitely and elegantly, petite and delicate, full of poetic mood and artistic conception. In a secluded courtyard, lush bamboo formed a shade, surrounded by short fences. The autumn wind blew, and fallen leaves tapped on the window glass, making a sound that seemed like sobbing and sighing! So I imagined that Lion Grove Garden was the Xiaoxiang Pavilion of the Grand View Garden. I searched for the parrot cage on the rolled-up curtain; I inquired about the flower mound where fallen petals of spring and autumn were buried. I seemed to faintly hear the sound of broken strings of the guqin, the sound of humming, the sound of coughing, and also the sound of sobbing! But I couldn't see a trace of where these many sounds came from, only the swaying bamboo shadows in the moonlight! I couldn't help but feel a sense of desolation at the loss of people and the emptiness of the building! Stepping out of the secluded depths of Xiaoxiang, I strolled across the winding bridge and gazed at the withered stems of the lotus in the pond. Witnessing flocks of gulls flying back and forth, I felt endless vicissitudes rippling in the fountain of life, and I was disheartened! At this moment, a group of tourists suddenly jumped out of the white stone-built painted boat, laughing and startling me back to my senses. I gazed intently at the sky, and realized that I had briefly left the realm of reality, and now I was back, my mind somewhat dazed!</p>
<p>The next morning, I drove to the Humble Administrator's Garden. During the period of occupation, it was the site of the enemy puppet provincial government, and now it has been taken over by the Social Education College. I immediately visited Mr. Gu Jiankang, who teaches at the college. After a decade apart, my old friend's temples had turned gray! The cruel war ravaged everyone. Mr. Gu led me to visit the entire garden. The place was indeed twice as large as Lion Grove Garden and much cleaner. Perhaps because it had been tainted by the footprints of a group of dogs, I wasn't very interested. At the same time, the noise of the crowd ruined the elegant mood. However, a few continuing piano sounds, along with the songs of birds flying through the air, still allowed me to faintly smell some of the breath of nature!</p>
<p>After leaving the Humble Administrator's Garden, I originally wanted to visit the Canglang Pavilion and Hanshan Temple, but I heard that the Canglang Pavilion was the site of the Suzhou Art School and was closed to visitors, and it was also severely desolate. As for Hanshan Temple, it was even worse! The Japanese invaders had stolen the ancient bell from the temple, which greatly spoiled the scenery, so going there would only increase my anger, so I decided not to go. So I strolled through the Xuanmiao Temple in the city and toured the cityscape of Suzhou.</p>
<p>Xuanmiao Temple is like the Xiangguo Temple in Kaifeng and the City God Temple in Shanghai. Inside, there were stalls selling snacks, miscellaneous toys, fortune-telling services, and flowers and birds. In the main hall, there were also many shops selling calligraphy and paintings in the national style, with red and green streamers hanging all over the walls, depicting stories circulating among the people, or gods, ladies, and dolls. I remember when I was little, before the New Year, my father would buy these doll paintings and hang them on my bedside. These types of paintings were usually rarely inquired about, and only during the New Year were they particularly prosperous. Now, because the Spring Festival was approaching, every painting shop was busy rushing to produce them. The painters ranged from twelve or thirteen years old to sixty or seventy years old, some with sores on their faces, some with only one eye, and they all looked very poor. Relying on a brush manipulated by a mechanical hand, earning a living was not easy. Although these painters didn't have much knowledge, their hearts were very kind. They drew inspiration from historical anecdotes of loyalty, filial piety, and righteousness, and the educational effect they achieved was no less than that of ordinary "experts" and "masters"! However, they could only cower in the inconspicuous and dimly lit ancient temples, and they had no honor to receive social courtesy, because they were a group of insignificant people who could not enter the "hall of great elegance"!</p>
<p>In front of Xuanmiao Temple was the busiest street in Suzhou. The largest teahouse was called Wu Yuan, and the most elegant teahouse was called Yi Yuan. It is said that leisurely locals spend the whole day there, whether it's discussing business or talking about love, it's all suitable. This custom is very similar to that of Chengdu. I love this custom, so I love Chengdu and also love Suzhou. If one day I am qualified to rest, then I will definitely come to such a place and live for a year and a half, or even permanently.</p>
<p>In the hour before my departure, my cousin and I and others were still enjoying a special feast in a clean and elegant small tavern. The famous clear water crabs were plump and delicious. Drinking and chatting with old friends, I truly felt like I wouldn't return until I was drunk!</p>
<p>Finally, I hastily left Suzhou again, but this time she gave me a deeper impression. Back in Shanghai, I still can't forget Suzhou's exquisite elegance and Suzhou's petite and exquisite charm! (Evening of November 20, 35th year, Shanghai Bund)</p>
<h3 id="e123">A Few Words on Poetry By Lin Feng <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>Someone said: "Poets are magicians of language." I say poets are discoverers of truth. Writing poetry is not just about inspiration; genuinely experiencing a vibrant life will reveal more poetic material. Classical poets write poetry to praise, modern poets write poetry to create: people use his voice to move forward, to know which places are traps and abysses, and which places are worth lingering and returning to.</p>
<h3 id="e124">Record of Returning Home by Lü Baihua <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>Half a Day in Tianzhu</p>
<p>"The water shimmers, clear and bright on sunny days; the mountain colors are strangely beautiful even in sudden rain." Since Su Dongpo scattered these two lines of poetry, West Lake has become an abstract beauty in the eyes of later generations, good at all times whether lightly or heavily made up. But "good at all times" neglects the night. I believe that boating on West Lake at night is even better than in sunshine or rain. So day and night, I and Zhun bought a boat for another tour. The oars beat the surface of the lake at night. Because there was no moon, we passed through the Broken Bridge, the boat gently touching the lotus leaves. Especially a kind of elegant tranquility seemed to surpass the ordinary world.</p>
<p>The next day, Ziyou ran over early in the morning. He took half a day off to accompany me to Tianzhu. The warmth of friendship made my weary traveler's heart excited. From Hubin to Lingyin, there were public buses every few minutes. The bus drove across the lake embankment and climbed the steep mountain road. Thousands of wisps of moisture soaked my clothes, and pure emptiness filled my embrace. This is something that cannot be touched in Shanghai. The best part of Lingyin is the cluster of peaks in front of the mountain gate, called "Flying Peak." In the past, the old man Quyuan often lingered here, because there is a Cold Spring under Flying Peak. He cleverly matched the phrase "Since when did the spring begin to be cold? From where did the mountain fly?" with "The spring began to be cold when it was cold, and the mountain flew from where it flew." According to legend, Flying Peak was originally called Lingjiu Peak: "In the Jin Dynasty, the Western monk Huili ascended this mountain and sighed, 'This is a small ridge of Lingjiu Mountain in the Tianzhu Kingdom. I don't know when it flew here'?" Looking at the cluster of peaks overlapping in the middle, many Buddha statues are engraved, and the clamorous sound of water flows from the foot of the peak, which is indeed very impressive. We walked into a small cave. A monk stood up, pointed to the top with a bamboo pole, and said to us, "This is a line of sky!" After saying that, he reached out his hand to ask us to donate some green, equal to a beggar on the street. Although he was inevitably pitiful, I couldn't help but feel wronged for the famous mountain.</p>
<p>Outside the mountain gate, a long row of bamboo sedan chairs were lined up, which was the business of going to Gaoyan. We turned towards Tianzhu. The chair carriers bargained fiercely, insisting on eight thousand yuan. Ziyou told me that the people of Yizhou were the worst in this regard. They were clearly "gouging us." We offered him three thousand, which he naturally refused, but after walking a distance and then another distance, we actually caught up to the halfway point of the mountain. He waved his hand, meaning he agreed to the deal. Ziyou got angry and simply didn't sit, anyway, it wasn't much further to Lower Tianzhu. Further up, it was written "Middle Tianzhu Kingdom." These four characters were quite vigorous. We entered the hall. A traveling monk talked with us for a long time. He mentioned Master Hongyi, saying that no one could chant sutras like him, but he was not boastful. I had seen Hongyi's calligraphy at the home of Xia Mianzun, and I had also seen the elephant that Hongyi made for Xia Mianzun. Master Hongyi was the only great monk in China. It was a pity that we met too late. It could be said that this traveling monk was not vulgar to pay attention to his deeds.</p>
<p>Further up was Upper Tianzhu, where the Great Earth of Perfect Penetration was enshrined. "Perfect Penetration" also gives us an enlightenment on how to live our lives. Buddhism divides "Righteous Law" and "Perfect Penetration" into two terms. It seems that in the "Breaking Text Nirvana," it was discussed that the Righteous Law Eye Treasury cannot despise Perfect Penetration. The distance between the three Tianzhu temples is a straight upward mountain path. After all, it is not the Western Tianzhu, only adorned with three temples. The scenery is far inferior to Lingyin, but just on this straight upward mountain path, winding, is very meaningful, indeed "three sides are blocked by mountains, the middle road is a straight pass, like two valleys."</p>
<p>Suddenly, heavy rain poured down the mountain, and we hurriedly left the Han Valley-like Three Tianzhu.</p>
<p>Solemn appearance under Flying Peak,</p>
<p>Overgrown weeds are now half-eroded;</p>
<p>Is it suitable for beggars to beg at the Qushou,</p>
<p>Suspended sounds between the rocks are like the Wu Xiao!</p>
<p>Traveling monk in Middle Tianzhu Kingdom,</p>
<p>Can speak of the former teacher Hongyi;</p>
<p>If you understand the reason, you will fly away,</p>
<p>Transmitting scriptures with blood written by ten fingers.</p>

<p>In the issue of the 25th of this month, this publication published an article "From the Perspective of Sexual Psychology, Talking about Havelock Ellis." The original was written in Chongqing last summer. In a hurry, Havelock Ellis and Havelock Harris were discussed as one, and no separate title was listed.

<p>"Brother, we've already performed the formalities of the social scene. You shouldn't be so overly polite with me..." Pingzi corrected her expression, her two bright and sparkling eyes gazing at Hejian. But to say she corrected her expression is not quite right. For someone as charming and alluring as Pingzi, her expressions were limited to just two: smiling and crying. And even then, she was only expressing something other than smiling when she was crying extremely sadly, covering her face so her expression couldn't be seen. Otherwise, even if she was angry, furious, annoyed, sorrowful, or even scolding someone fiercely, there always seemed to be a hint of a smile between her eyebrows and the corners of her mouth. Just imagine, as in the old novels, "almond eyes," "willow eyebrows," "peach cheeks," "lotus face," and so on—just close your eyes and imagine these outlines and arrangements, and you can imagine that this is a naturally sweet and smiling expression, how could it possibly be fierce and stern?</p>
<p>So when it says here that Pingzi corrected her expression, it just means she reined in some of her smile. What's strange is that in the short few minutes since Hejian left, Pingzi's attitude suddenly changed, and her tone also changed. The perfectly fine Mr. Hejian, Hejian-kun, changed in an instant to Brother. This kind of address, which is neither Westernized nor purely Japanese, has a bit of a "China" semi-affectionate and semi-江湖 flavor. Where did it jump out from? What kind of riddle is hidden within it? Of course, Hejian couldn't help but be surprised when he heard this suddenly changing style.</p>
<p>"Of course, the wild boar must have inquired about him, and reported everything about me." She resumed her original playfulness, smiling quietly, indicating that Hejian's actions just now were all within her clear observation. She saw that Hejian seemed confused on the outside, smiling along, but his heart was probably more shaken than if he had been hit by a cannonball. Feeling a little unbearable, she immediately stopped laughing.</p>
<p>"Brother, you don't need to be surprised." She softened her voice, moving closer to Hejian, as if whispering in his ear, "My father and your father have been very close in recent years. Perhaps you don't know that, brother. The two old generations are as close as brothers, so it's probably not too presumptuous for me to call you brother, is it?"</p>
<p>Hejian was, after all, someone who had weathered storms, so Pingzi's successive changes, each more startling than the last, he still managed to hold on and maintain his composure, determined to see what her grand finale would be.</p>
<p>"Brother, your work at the General Headquarters on the mainland is so active. Every time I see it in the newspapers, and hear the two old men's various comments about you over wine and tea, I can't help but admire you. It's just a pity that I also have duties on this side, and I can't get away. Otherwise, I would definitely come to the mainland, even if it's just to follow your orders, I would still be honored... But..."!</p>
<p>"Praise... too much praise, but..."? Hejian was eager to hear what she was going to say next, unwilling to stall any longer.</p>
<p>"Yes..."! Pingzi seemed to completely understand Hejian's meaning, so she quickly continued, "But according to the General Headquarters' position, everything you do, brother, is of course in line with their ideals. But my father and your father have a different view: they think you've gone astray. As for what counts as going astray, I can't explain it clearly at the moment. I hope you'll understand that, brother."</p>
<h3 id="e127">Small Record by Lu Yan By Li Jinming <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>Lu Yan, a native of Daihai, Zhejiang, is said by some to be one of the more stable writers. He came to Changsha in 1927 for a certain creation, but he always refused to stay in the city of Changsha for a moment. He was willing to live in a small building in a folk house on the Shuilu Zhou, and go to the beach every day to meet friends. Sometimes, when he was mentally unstable, she said:</p>
<p>"Isn't it okay to live in Shuilu Zhou? Is it necessarily that Shuilu Zhou is completely under the jurisdiction of Changsha?"</p>
<p>In 1931, he edited a literary magazine in Guilin, unaware of that extraordinary era. He obviously wanted to create a small paradise, and pull a few friends to jointly enjoy the dream of the Peach Blossom Spring, where they were frightened every day. Even so, someone after all pointed out that he was not faithful. Saying that he was timid and wanted to compromise with the invaders. So he shouted loudly in a novel:</p>
<p>"Am I that kind of person—compromising with the invaders... I oppose them the most, I oppose them the most—"</p>
<p>His works are rarely influenced by trends. He has translated from Finnish, Czech, New Greek, New Jewish, Bulgarian... and other short works, experiencing a moderate view of life, and dissolving it into his own art with the meaning of his bourgeois life, which can very well arouse the recognition of people with deeper social and political anger. Like H.G. Wells, he is a "rough brush" writer, and his articles do not seem to be carefully polished. He sometimes looks down on creation; "Just write it down, why bother collecting it!" He once said this kind of emotional words to people.</p>
<p>But the excellent achievements left by Mr. Lu Yan in the literary world are the short stories he translated in the 16th and 17th years of the Republic of China, such as Ding Linke, Henryk Sienkiewicz's Old Servant, At the Springside... like the beauty of a complete style, he was praised by people, and he collected it in Guilin in 1932 and reprinted it. He gave this to his friends who came to visit him... At this time, he was already ill with hemorrhoids and lay in bed in a small building in northwest Guilin all day long.</p>
<p>After all, there are many friends who love Lu Yan, and they all praise him for sacrificing for literature and art from beginning to end. He does not kick at the environment he is in. He often says to people:</p>
<p>"I write, learn Esperanto from Ai Luo Xianhe, all because of my own efforts. My family is not very good, and in order to save money, I was instructed by the head of the family when I was young—to seek truth from facts and work as an apprentice in a store. During this period, I worked hard during the day and read magazines and novels at night; the owner's wife pitied me for getting tuberculosis from lack of rest and dismissed me. But I had already cultivated the desire to write in those short years and learned to describe things in vernacular. In the next few years, I began to associate with bookstores, and also met Master Zhou Yu Cai in the form of correspondence. The new tide of the May Fourth Movement is welcoming my ship..."</p>
<p>Being sharp and working hard is after all extraordinary—in the fourteenth year, he was a teacher at the Beijing Esperanto School; in the sixteenth year, he compiled and printed his debut short stories, translation collections, and served as a member of the Shishanshan Road Esperanto Society; in the twenty-second year, he went to Xi'an. In the twenty-seventh year, he came to Changsha again, then went to Hankou, and the following year, went to Guangxi and served as a teacher at the Rongxian Liuqing Normal School; in the thirty-first year, he began to edit a literary magazine. The following year, he suffered from hemorrhoids, and the operation did not save him. People collected medical expenses for him, and his ex-wife Shi Nv Tu returned home (Xiangxiang). Within a few months, he died of illness on the way to Guilin.</p>
<p>Isn't Lu Yan's loss equal to the fall of a star? 20, 9, 35 years old in Hu.</p>

<h3 id="e129">Free Talk: Wool Felt By Shao Fu <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>Last night, the north wind was strong, and the streets seemed even more desolate. People's various needs for protection against the cold naturally felt particularly pressing. Among them, the minimum requirement is clothing and bedding, so-called warm clothes and warm sleep.</p>
<p>A few days ago, the public education personnel goods distribution office had negotiated with the Materials Supply Bureau to handle the distribution of military wool felt under the heading of surplus U.S. military materials. The result of the registration of public education personnel in the city was that about 50,000 items were needed. All procedures had been completed, and everyone was naturally waiting for this wool felt to increase the warmth of the cold night. However, news came that the Supply Bureau overturned the past agreement on the grounds of "no goods in stock." At the same time, it was also heard that dozens of merchants purchased the wool felt under various names and sold it at high prices on the black market. They purchased the wool felt and sold it at high prices on the black market.</p>
<p>These news, in this weather with howling north winds, made people feel even colder when they heard it.</p>
<p>We are not willing to investigate whether it is true or not, and how it happened. We only hope that the Supply Bureau will quickly distribute this batch of wool felt to everyone, otherwise, it will be suspicious.</p>
<p>Since its establishment, the Supply Bureau has done a lot of work. We feel that it is not a purely commercial organization after all, but it cannot fail to take into account the welfare of the people.</p>
<h3 id="e130">I am a Little Soldier By Zhang Peide <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>It's only been fifteen days, and I'm already looking forward to the end of the month; but what's there to be happy about when the end of the month comes? Receiving a pay slip and a few thin banknotes from the squad leader, I can only swallow my tears into my stomach.</p>
<p>Salary: 8,000 yuan</p>
<p>Straw sandals subsidy: 200 yuan</p>
<p>Deducted insufficient food expenses: 800 yuan</p>
<p>Remaining: 7,400 yuan.</p>
<p>7,400 yuan, this amount is the reward for a month. This money is enough for young masters to watch a play once, enough for young ladies to take a ride once.</p>
<p>In all conscience, I am indeed patriotic. For the sake of patriotism, I left my old mother and abandoned my profession during the Anti-Japanese War to become a soldier from thousands of miles away. But in recent years, especially after the victory, the doubts in my heart have piled up layer by layer like the silt in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River. I love my country, but has my country ever loved me? How many parents would be willing to let their beloved children freeze and starve? Similarly, which country would let its soldiers live in poverty?</p>
<p>I haven't been on the street for a few days, because I don't want to go on the street either. The gazes swept over by those high-spirited adults, gentlemen, young masters, and young ladies often contain a bit of contempt, ridicule, and mockery. Especially when passing in front of them, they turn their heads, hold their breath, and are afraid that a stench will rush into their noses. Yes, we may be stained with the blood of the enemy, and we may be a bit poor, but it's always better than the copper stink and superficiality on their bodies!</p>
<p>In the year since the victory, we have been deeply discriminated against. Of course, there are a few soldiers and even impostors who have caused trouble outside, but this cannot represent the discipline of the entire Chinese army. Because some soldiers rode on buses without tickets and watched plays without tickets, the × department ×× department posted public notices, ordering them to be stopped and even holding meetings to discuss ways to ban them. Is it difficult to say that soldiers are born willing to ride "white buses," watch "white plays," and commit "white crimes"? Who will think about our soldiers' situation? Postal and telecommunications fares have increased fivefold, and ××× salaries have increased × times, but what about us? In July, I heard that salaries would be increased by 60%, several meetings were held, and repeated orders were issued, but we haven't received it yet. I believe our salaries, like postal and telecommunications, will certainly be more refreshing than those of adults and gentlemen to take the bus and watch plays.</p>
<p>In fact, those comrades who want to ride white buses and watch white plays are thinking too much. Entertainment, is that something you get? You are a Chinese soldier; you have won, and you have to be locked in the barracks.</p>
<p>My mother's letter came almost two months ago, saying that bandits are causing trouble and she can't survive. And after being away for a few years, I should have been promoted to some kind of official. Remember my mother who is suffering at home, and if I can't go home, I must send some money back no matter what. These words are like thorns piercing my heart.</p>
<p>The autumn wind is rising, blowing coldly on my body. The bayonet reflects the dark light, revealing a pale light. Is it satire or mockery?</p>
<p>Lying under the thin military blanket, still waiting for the dawn.</p>
<h3 id="e131">Think and Say By Min <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>Someone said: The more the relationship between the United States and the Soviet Union diverges, the faster Japan will recover.</p>
<p>Someone said: The National Assembly was convened in violation of the Political Consultative Conference agreement, so they will not participate; and the Political Consultative Conference stipulated that the date of the National Assembly was May 5, 35th year of the Republic of China. This probably means they will never participate in the National Assembly convened in Nanjing.</p>
<p>Someone said: The constitution produced this time will be handed over to the "Alliance" after it is enacted, in order to guarantee the "domestic legal rights."</p>
<p>Now some old people are a little unwilling to join the Communist Party, they are afraid of being unfashionable to say good things for the government, and they are afraid of being inconvenient to join the Third Party. Making a living is nothing but fame and fortune, it is really depressing and depressing.</p>

<p>Thinking of danger in times of peace</p>
<p>The air raid siren, the long siren, still makes me shudder when I think of it. After the victory, the heart-pounding "air raid siren" was changed to the loud "echo" at noon, which made people feel a sense of "peace and prosperity." Some people say that the echo means "the sound of victory," because the "回" of "echo" is taken from the V of Victory! It's really good at praising and wonderful beyond words.</p>
<p>The other day was Air Defense Day. In the morning, the "air raid siren" suddenly sounded, followed by the sound of machines. If it had been between July and August last year, I don't know how worried I would have been, but today, hearing it, I have a feeling of "unusual ease." But, friends, in today's world where the great powers are actively preparing for war again, and where the little bastards on the other side say "we'll meet again," who can guarantee that this siren won't "turn fake into real" someday!</p>
<p>Thinking of danger in times of peace, we should be vigilant, and put fewer words like "victorious country," "one of the four great powers," and "national demeanor" in our minds!</p>

<p>A child said: "Old people are cunning and sly, young people are glib and smooth-tongued; only children are pure and innocent"!</p>
<h3 id="e134">News Figures: Mr. Zhang Dongsun By Zheng Feng <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>Northern Leader of the Social Democratic Party</p>
<p>A short stature, energetic spirit, a pair of light-colored glasses on the bridge of his nose, this is another giant of the Social Democratic Party—Professor Zhang Dongsun, the leader of the Social Democratic Party in North China.</p>
<p>This Mr. Zhang is an old professor and philosopher who is 63 years old. Generally speaking, his scholarly atmosphere seems to be stronger than his political atmosphere. He is a native of Suzhou and studied in Japan. He also came from the journalism industry; in the early years of the Republic of China, he served as the director of the Gonghe Daily, Fuyu Magazine, Dazhonghua Magazine, and Zhengyi Magazine, and also served as the editor-in-chief of the Shishi Xinbao.</p>
<p>It is said that Mr. Zhang's arguments published in the newspaper were very "strange," and the degree of "strangeness" can be illustrated by one thing. When Mr. Sun Yat-sen, the father of the nation, passed away in the fourteenth year of the Republic of China, Mr. Zhang published an article in the Shishi Xinbao entitled "Mr. Sun Yat-sen is Dead!" The word "竟" is truly "strange" to use.</p>
<p>After that, Mr. Zhang turned to the education field and served as a philosophy professor at the National Chengchi University, Shanghai Guanghua University, Guanxian Northeast University, and Peiping Peking University. Everyone knows that Mr. Zhang has written several books that are among the best in the country, such as "Philosophy and Science," "Reason Philosophy," and "New Philosophy Theory," and his translations include "Metabolism" and "Matter and Memory."</p>
<p>During the Anti-Japanese War, he organized the "Northern National Salvation Association," which included "non-party and non-faction" as well as representatives of the Kuomintang and the Communist Party. The main work was to send people to rear areas and provide intelligence. After the outbreak of the Pacific War, Mr. Zhang was arrested and monitored by the enemy for some time.</p>
<p>He had a deep private relationship with Mr. Zhang Junmai. After the establishment of the Social Democratic Party, he became the person in charge in North China. When the Social Democratic Party's participation in the National Assembly became quite heated, Mr. Zhang seemed to be even more involved. Zhang Dongsun's name was not seen in the list submitted by the Social Democratic Party. Like Mr. Zhang Junmai, he also took on the role of a professor.</p>
<h3 id="e135">Story of a Misleading Professor By Holy <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>It is said that one day, four big characters suddenly appeared on the blackboard of a school classroom: "Misleading Students." The class bell rang, but the janitor did not come to the classroom to wipe off the words on the blackboard. When a certain professor hurriedly stepped into the classroom, he did not notice it for a while, and still talked endlessly about the old plaster of the past. Five minutes later, when he turned around to write on the blackboard with chalk, he suddenly discovered those four big characters, and suddenly his expression was awkward. The whole classroom burst into laughter, and then he hurriedly explained a lot of principles, implying that he did not "mislead students." At the same time, he said to the students: "Who wrote this?" Not a single student answered. Finally, a student stood up and said: "Sir! I was one of the first to arrive, and I saw these four characters as soon as I came in. It was probably written by the students in the previous class. Please don't suspect us!" The professor himself was "guilty," so he let it pass!</p>
<p>Originally, the matter was like this: On the first day of class, this professor held the "fooling around" doctrine and talked nonsense about things unrelated to the topic. He was not lecturing, but promoting the author of a book. The students did not have this book, and what he talked about was beyond the scope of the subject. Of course, the students were very impatient. However, he still continued to muddle along regardless. It was probably less than an hour! The professor said: "I'm sorry, everyone, I have a little something to do today. I won't be teaching the next hour, I'm very sorry." Originally, the students were already dissatisfied with him, but he had to run away early, which was too much. Therefore, a student couldn't help but stood up with an iron face and said: "Sir! What you lecture about makes us fall into a fog, it's simply inexplicable. I don't know what class you are actually teaching. If you are talking about ××××, there is Professor ××, if you are talking about ×××, there is Professor ×××, we don't need knowledge outside of the topic that conflicts with another subject. At the same time, we pay money to study, not to be ghosts, so we naturally hope to get some real things. Therefore, please don't lecture like this again next time, and it's best not to leave early, please finish the two hours before leaving. This is a small suggestion from the students, I'm being presumptuous!" After hearing this, the professor blushed, mumbled a few perfunctory words, and ran away. This was the first time.</p>
<p>The second time he taught, the professor was still the same old tune, and even more clever than the previous time. He took a book and read from it, and copied the news from the newspaper onto the blackboard. In this way, it was easier to muddle through the time, and the students hated him even more. They almost thought he was a bit like old cowhide candy, with a face as thick as a city wall. When they met this kind of person, everyone could only shake their heads. Finally, a certain student, again "as before," stood up and asked him a bunch of questions, asking him to answer. Although the professor knew that he was not good, he still had no shame, and said hundreds of words, indicating that he had answered the student very correctly. At this time, the professor's savior, the dismissal bell, rang, and he ran away again. This was the second time.</p>
<p>With these two records, he of course deserved the four characters "Misleading Students" on the blackboard!</p>

<p>The Westinghouse Foundation of the United States is committed to the cultivation of scientific talents. It began selecting geniuses in senior middle schools in 1942. There are 15,000 male and female geniuses selected, with female students accounting for about one-quarter. Among them, 1,500 are "future scientists." 147 outstanding boys and 53 girls each received a scholarship of US$55,000. Currently, 106 people are studying at 57 universities in the United States, and 73 people have just been discharged from the military and will continue their research work.</p>
<p>The sixth annual selection began at the end of September this year, presided over by Watson Davis, chairman of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. 27,000 public and private middle schools in the United States can participate, and it is expected that 3,500 geniuses can be selected, among which 40 will be reselected. These future scientists will gather for five days at the Washington Science Talent Center next year for training and receive scholarships. (Translated from Science, OCT 1948)</p>

<p>A few days ago, I read a newsletter about the frontier in the newspaper, as if I was having a dream!</p>
<p>Speaking of the frontier, we are very ashamed. Such a country with remote borders does not even have an accurate map or a detailed and accurate statistics. History tells us that the disasters in Chinese freedom history mostly originated in the frontier. The Huns in ancient times and Xinjiang in modern times are complicated situations, but the reasons are very simple. They are all because we are too ignorant of the situation in the frontier. Therefore, disasters occur in a hurry, and we are at a loss.</p>

<p>The Chinese Seamen's Business Colleagues Association, ordered to be prepared for establishment, has been ready for six months. On the 25th of this month, a founding meeting was held at the Xingzhong School on Avenue Foch at 2:00 PM. More than 100 members, all business directors of Jianghai ships, attended. The chairman first reported the purpose of the establishment order and the preparation process. Yang Xiaotian, a special commissioner from the Seamen's Union, attended and gave instructions. Sun Liping, a member of the union committee, made a speech stating three points: (1) All business colleagues should maintain close contact with the association to enrich the organization. (2) Each should exert their strength in their position to promote the development of shipping. (3) All business colleagues should be guided by the spirit of mutual support and be in a leading position to train other sailors on the ship, unify forces, and strengthen the organization. He hoped that the colleagues of the association would earnestly implement these points. Fifteen directors, seven alternate directors, five supervisors, and three alternate supervisors were immediately elected, and the draft charter of the association was approved. The ceremony was completed around 5:00 PM, and a photo was taken for remembrance.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Tao Berlin, the ex-husband of the "Mermaid" Yang Xiuqiong, is a famous jockey. Since coming last year, he has not easily found a suitable residence and has been staying at the home of his friend Chen Ren at 151 Putuo Road. Because Chen was often away on business, only his wife, Ms. Wang (35 years old, from Changsha), remained at home. Due to their close proximity, affection gradually arose, and they finally went together to Room 12 of the Taihe Hotel on Seymour Road in March of last year to have their first physical relationship. Afterwards, they continued to enjoy each other from time to time. Recently, Chen discovered this, and confronted Ms. Wang, who frankly admitted to the affair. Chen was extremely angry and reported it to the police station in charge. The police dispatched officers to bring Tao to the station for questioning. Tao also admitted to having an adulterous relationship with Ms. Wang. Just as the police station was preparing to transfer Tao and Wang to the District Prosecutor's Office, Chen suddenly considered the impact on his reputation and requested the police station to withdraw the charges, stating that he did not want to escalate the situation. The police station, considering that although the case of Tao and Wang could be withdrawn by her husband, Chen, they still violated the law and should be detained for five days as a warning.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] At 8:30 PM the night before last, four thieves broke into the Meda Western Clothing Store at 640 Dong Yu Hang Road in Pudong. They entered the store and threatened people with guns, forbidding them from making any noise. They stole a black overcoat and a piece of black wool, and then fled separately through the front door towards the east. The owner, Ting Zhenying, secretly followed them, shouting loudly. The thieves abandoned the stolen goods on Gaoyang Road in the dark and tried to escape. Officer No. 1682 heard the noise and intercepted the thief. At that time, Zhang Renyou, the director of the Tilanqiao Branch Bureau, along with Section Chief Ma Zhuwang and several plainclothes police officers led by Gao Yong'an, arrived and immediately took the thief to the bureau for interrogation. The suspect stubbornly refused to confess, only admitting to knowing a person named Xiao Erzi. Subsequently, the investigating police officers went to the suspect's relatives and friends' residences to investigate, but found no clues. They changed their approach and searched hotels in Hongkou and Tilanqiao. As a result, they captured two thieves in Room 11 of the Xi'an Hotel on Zhoujiazui Road. According to their confession, their accomplice, Liu Gongpei, who was carrying a gun, went to No. 11, Lane 135, Caishi Street. They then went to that location and captured him, confiscating a pistol and 14 rounds of ammunition. The incident occurred at 8:30 PM, and by midnight, all the people, stolen goods, weapons, and ammunition had been completely recovered.</p>

<p>(1) Hoarse Voice</p>
<p>Cui Zhuodong asks: I am 37 years old and have had lung disease for six years. I cough and spit yellow phlegm, especially in the morning. Other than that, I have no other symptoms. My diet and bowel movements are normal, but my throat has been hoarse since April of last year, and it has not healed for more than a year. This phenomenon should be related to lung disease, but I don't know: (1) Is it laryngeal tuberculosis? (2) Is there a specific medicine for this disease? Which medicine is most suitable to take? (3) Can the new Taiwanese lung treatment drug "Staphylo-Pac" be taken?</p>
<p>[Answer from Dr. Tang Renjin, Doctor of Medicine]</p>

<p>(1) If it is tinea versicolor, then it is caused by fungal filaments leading to pigment loss. In addition to using pigment puncture, carbon snow, and sun lamp irradiation, there is no effective radical treatment. It is best to consult a dermatologist for a more appropriate examination.</p>
<p>(3) Pus-Filled Pustules All Over the Head</p>
<p>Ju Youtao asks: My younger brother is now thirteen years old. When he was five or six years old, he had a large boil on his head. It was not treated and healed on its own after two months, but other parts suddenly developed countless small pustules filled with pus. When the pustules burst, they discharge yellow sticky fluid and form scabs. Now half of his hair has fallen out, which is unsightly. Please tell me: (1) Is this disease caused by the residual poison of that boil, and can it be cured? How to treat it? Is there a specific medicine that can be applied? (2) Can the hair be regrown? (3) Can rubbing fresh ginger on the scalp make the hair grow back?</p>
<p>[Answer from Dr. Tang Renjin, Doctor of Medicine]</p>
<p>(1) Yes, difficult. First, consult a dermatologist, determine what the disease is, and then determine the treatment plan. (2) First explore the cause of hair loss, and then determine whether it can be regrown. (3) If the hair follicles are healthy, you may want to try it.</p>

<h3 id="e146">Market is Filled with Bullish News; Chinese Stocks Suddenly See a Reversal; Buying Spree with Many Stocks Hitting Limit Up; Nine Black Markets Ordered to Close <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, large players manipulated Chinese stocks, opening much lower to attract short sellers to cover. As a result, buying sentiment turned around, stirring short covering. The rally was significant. Xinyi opened slightly lower, but when Yongsha Exchange 151 deliberately sold sharply, the opening price plummeted to 450 yuan, attracting short sellers. Therefore, the delivery of Yongmiao Exchange opened with everyone rushing to buy, reversing to a higher opening. After the opening, prices rose from low to high. Numbers 176, 151, 173, and 199 entered the market aggressively. Guangbang took a two-pronged approach, buying both spot and delivery Yongsha, boosting buying momentum. However, there was a slight pullback after 10:00 AM. Then, Meiya spot was bought by number 199 and hit the limit up, sparking renewed risk appetite. Yongsha approached the 500 yuan mark. From 10:00 to 11:30 AM, Guangbang occasionally sold, and number 152 and others sold off, causing a slight pullback. But the struggle after the drop was intense. Numbers 28, 36, 151, and 83 all entered the market, and number 89 covered shorts. As a result, the 500 yuan mark was finally broken again. Number 165 aggressively entered delivery Yongsha, and number 44 aggressively entered spot Yongsha. Near noon, all stocks soared again. Number 157 posted a limit up for Match, and number 173 posted a limit up for Company. The entire market was filled with buying sentiment. At noon, Guangbang continued to supply, and number 151 also took the opportunity to sell, causing a slight pullback. In the end, the mood was optimistic, and the short squeeze took shape. The afternoon close was still firm, with Xinyi forming an inverted market and Yongsha rising by 10% compared to the previous close, Huafeng up by half a percent, and the rest up by more than 10%. The cold stock, Match Company, rose by half, and the rest rose slightly from half a percent or less. Delivery Huabian rose by a little more than half a percent, Yongsha and Qinxing rose by a good 10%, and Xinyi, Meiya, Jingfu, and Xinguang each rose by a little more than 10%. In the afternoon, only spot transactions were made. At the opening, the momentum of the noon close continued, and prices were high, but soon they were forced down by sellers. As the pullback began, the mood suddenly became timid. Numbers 180, 199, and others all sold, and number 89 and others suppressed prices most aggressively. Buyers were hesitant, and prices soon fell continuously. The limit up Meiya also pulled back. When Yongsha retreated to 490 yuan, numbers 198 and 185 and others entered the market, temporarily rising by more than ten yuan. However, number 180 and others did not stop selling, and the struggle continued until the close. Compared to the previous close, Yongsha, Xinyi, and Huafeng rose by a little more than half a percent, and Meiya, Jingfu, Yonggong, Xinguang, and Qinxing each rose by about 10%. Cold stocks lacked trading activity after the opening. Ruian, Yongni, and Wuhe all fell. Datong, Neiyi, and Rongfeng rose by about half a percent, Jinglun Match rose by 15%, and Zhongfang and Xinya rose by 10%. Delivery only traded for half a day, with Yongsha, Xinyi, Xinguang, and Qinxing rising by 10%, and Meiya and Jingfu each rising by 15%. The rise and fall of stocks outside the market were minimal.</p>
<p>Foreign stocks remained stable yesterday, with minimal fluctuations in individual stocks. The results showed that Yisha, Yeguang, Yipi, Aviation, and other stocks rose slightly compared to the previous close, Yinglian Aviation and Paper fell slightly, and Steel remained flat.</p>

<p>The securities, rayon, and cotton yarn black markets in this city are fueling speculation and disrupting prices. Mayor Wu previously instructed the Administrative Department of the Police Bureau to strictly crack down on them. Yesterday (the 27th), the Economic Section of the department, together with the Social Bureau, investigated and found nine illegal businesses operating off-market black market securities trading, including Xiexingyong on South Wuxi Road, Taikangheng on Henan Road, Hongqingyong, Xingchang on Central Road, Wanlong, Taifeng, Anli on Zhongzheng Road, and Yuanchang and Fukang on Jiujiang Road. The managers of each business have been summoned and ordered to cease operations.</p>

<p>Yesterday, a certain bank still entrusted Room 604 to purchase more than one million yuan of government bonds. Large players both bought and sold, and the market was relatively stable. Tongbing opened in the morning at 1450 yuan, with a low price of 1400 yuan. It rebounded in the middle of the day to 1470 yuan, and struggled around 1450 yuan near noon. As a result, it rose by 30 yuan compared to the previous close. Jiayi and Yiyi were flat, Tongding rose by 50 yuan, and Tongwu rose by 30 yuan.</p>
