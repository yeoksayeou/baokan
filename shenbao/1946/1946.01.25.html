<h3>憲草問題可順利解決　政治軍事尙待洽商　綜合組今日開二次會</h3>
<p>〔本報重慶廿四日電〕政協會昨日各小組會商情形一度逆轉，因軍事組共黨提組聯合軍事委員會，國大組共黨仍堅持舊代表重選，民主同盟亦放棄其複決主張，而贊同共黨之重選主張。三組中僅綱領組意見接近，於復員·善救·敎育·文化各點，取得協議。此種情況直至午後四時綜合分組委會開首次會時方有改進。國大組已進行新增代表問題之分配問題，軍事組仍乏進展，其他三組無變化。今日軍事，憲草兩組續商，四時綜合小組開四次會。又昨晚蔣主席歡宴各代表後，曾與周恩來·張君勱·曾琦等四人會談，中共及民主同盟亦分別開會至深夜，內容均不得知，惟迄無何時可開大會之消息。衆信會議之成敗，緊於綜合分組及軍事三人小組之成就。</p>
<p>〔本報重慶廿四日電〕政治協商會議之軍事分組，今日繼續舉行第四次會議，較昨日有所進展，惟昨日第三次會議中，就改組軍事主管機構一項討論甚久，爭執頗烈，一部份會員咸認：軍事機構必須澈底改組，容納各方面人士，方可保證軍隊國家化之實施，至終未獲協議之各點，亦暫時保留。又政協會原來最多難題在國大舊代表之有效與否，昨日綜合小組中，此點已非問題。憲草洽商亦能順利解決。現在問題之中心爲政治與軍事組，只待兩組謀得意見接近後，綱領組亦可得相當解決。今日上午政治·軍事·綱領分組同時舉行，下午四時舉行憲草分組大會，僅將於最後召開一次會即告閉幕，惟三日中是否可討論吿一段落，尙難確言。</p>
<p>〔中央社重慶廿四日電〕政治協商會議分組委會憲草組及政府組織組·施政綱領組，於廿四日上下午開會，各項問題續有一部分獲得協議，明日各小組繼續協商，幷召集綜合委會第二次會議，不舉行大會。</p>
<p>〔合衆社重慶廿四日電〕美駐華特使馬歇爾元帥，今晨再度與蔣主席舉行會議·預料馬帥即將與軍事分組委員會開會，研究中國軍隊改組及國有化問題。</p>
<p>〔中央社重慶廿四日電〕馬歇爾特使，今晨十時於官邸接見張主席羣。</p>
<h3>泰安大同已停戰　集寗赤峯兩方面在談判中</h3>

<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦二十四日廣播：英國廣播公司特派員前日赴綏遠省集構視察停止開火令之執行情形，結果深覺前途樂觀。該員曾與共軍司令談話，據稱：中國內戰已連續三十五年，共黨亟盼能早日結束此種戰事。</p>
<p>〔聯合社北平廿四日電〕軍事調處執行部今日宣布：流動調查隊前往三處地點調停國共衝突，已有重大成就，另有數處地點，則在談判中。茲分述如下：（一）自重慶直飛豫南羅山之一隊來電報告，當地國共兩軍司令已成立妥協，各諭所部立即停止開火。（二）派往大同之一隊報告，二百廿一華里周圍，已停止戰事，外間雖傳共軍包圍大同，但報告中並未提及。（三）派往徐州之一隊報告，徐州附近衝突已减，雙方對於津浦及隴海綫交接處各終之重重事故，已加留意。（四）集寗方面談判仍在進行中，共黨稱在停戰令生效前佔據，國軍則稱於被佔後放棄。（五）赤峯方面亦在談判中，當地蘇軍撤退後，由保安隊維持秩序，蘇軍自赤峯撤退，應於昨日完成，多倫蘇聯駐軍並無動情。第五流動調查隊以張家口爲根據地，欲往多倫，須乘馬廿日始可達到。據聯合社隨隊攝影記者費倫稱，蘇軍進駐多倫時，不准共軍入內，但中國平民可以自由出入。</p>
<p>〔中央社徐州廿三日電〕軍事調處執行部徐州小組，廿一日赴津浦路韓莊前綫勘察，代表何華式上校，政府李樹正，共軍主世英，譯員二人，綏署派副參謀長謝慕莊，十九集團軍派高參李佑武陪同前往。</p>

<p>〔中央社南京廿四日電〕何總司令在渝公　，廿四日下午二時半，偕王司令官耀武等，專機飛返京。又軍政部次長兪大維，廿三日由渝飛抵京。</p>

<h3>瀋陽設立指揮所　派師長劉德川任警備司令　錦西區防務已由我軍接替</h3>
<p>〔本報北平廿三日電〕未來一週中，東北局勢發展已達重要階段，下月一日為蘇軍撤出東北之期，截至今日為止，尚未聞國府有重請蘇軍延期撤退之提議。據此間所得消息，蘇軍曾表示，目前東北燃料困難，頗影響其援用火車運兵之計劃，故潘陽等地蘇軍亦未實行接防。蘇方前曾通知長春我當局，承德·赤峯·張家口之綫，蘇軍本月廿日撤退，惟截止目前，該地區蘇軍似尚未接到撤退命令，熱河國軍並接獲勿越建昌之綫之蘇軍通知，該省國軍已準備蘇軍撤退後即行進駐。至長春接防問題，因蔣夫人蒞長關係，仍由蘇軍負責警備，熊式輝刻留錦州，俟國軍正式接防瀋陽後，即前往視察。</p>
<p>〔中央社瀋陽廿三日電〕東北保安司令長官部，為便於指揮接收瀋陽部隊，特設瀋陽指揮所，由彭副軍長　生任主任，長官部並派駐瀋第某師師長劉德川為瀋陽警備司令，瀋陽指揮所及警備司令均已於今日正式成立，頃彭主任告記者稱：蘇方已將錦西區防務移交我部隊。</p>
<p>〔路透社重慶廿四日電〕外次劉錯昨稱：東北蘇軍原定於二月三日撤退，惟以運輸困難，或當延長數日，以為日不多，故毋須正式延期。政府發言人昨列舉東北各城之業已成立中國行政機關或管轄者，長春，瀋陽，哈爾濱及錦州等均在內。</p>

<p>〔中央社錦州廿四日電〕朝陽訊：自國軍進駐後，軍民相安，市內秩序良好，商店紛紛復業，現市民正籌備慰勞國軍。</p>
<p>〔中央社錦州廿三日電〕自國軍駐防彰武後，市內漸趨繁盛，四鄉民衆紛紛來城，軍民相處，甚爲和睦。</p>

<p>〔路透社倫敦廿四日電〕政治安全委員會昨夜一致核准該委會致聯合國全體大會之第一件報告書，內提議由大會通過決義案，設一委員會，以處理因發現原子能所引起各問題及其有關事宜。</p>
<h3>社經會成立　印代表當選主席</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦廿四日電印度代表團長慕達里亞爵土。己當選爲經濟社會理事會主席，一般均認該理事會乃聯合國機構中最重要之機關，理事共十八人，其任務爲在全世界造成可消滅戰爭起因之經濟狀况，並將成爲聯合國對人類權利與基本自由之保衛者。昨夜該理事會在威士敏斯特敎會大厦之大會議室，舉行第一次正式會議，哥侖比亞代表雷斯特棄普建議，推舉慕達里亞爵士爲主席後，渠本人與南斯拉夫代表史丹巴以提名法當選爲副主席·慕達里以穩健語調致主席詞時，各代表熱烈鼓掌歡迎，其言略稱：「此次當選，榮幸奚似，然責任更爲重大，代表諸君咸明瞭本理事會之誕生及其所負責任，實爲世界眞正安全與前途所緊。此種任務殊　輕易，茲後必須不斷艱苦努力，本人決以主席資格，竭盡棉薄，以促進本理事會之目標，且信在座諸君均將出其全力，以求達此目的，本人辱承推舉，謹此誌謝」。</p>

<h3>美代表建議　修正託治制案　俾殖民地土著得享憲章利益　顧維鈞表示賛同</h3>
<p>〔合衆社倫敦二十四日電〕據聯合國機構美國代表團代表杜爾斯稱：美國將向聯合國建議，要求修正託治決議草案，俾殖民地國家准許其被統治人民享受聯合國憲章之利益，以實現「非自治人民之合法願望」。該項修正文副本已分送該委員會委員。該建議主張殖民地國家應使一切土著民族普遍享受聯合國憲章之利益，而非僅限於委任統治地之民族。以此兩大類非自治民族作一比較，委任統治地之住民共計一千三百萬人，而殖民地民族則有三萬萬人以上。據指稱，非委治地域大都處於極度動亂不安之狀態中，若僅為委治地民族着想而漠視殖民地民族，實屬錯誤。</p>

<p>〔法國新聞處巴黎廿三日電〕據各方可獲消息：戴高樂將軍將在其瑪麗勒洛亞住宅中小住數日，預料此後即行離此前往亞爾坦省之七泉堡。　從未表示即將出國之意，渠現每日以讀書散步消磨一部份時間，除渠前任內閣內少數同僚外，其他訪客概不接見</p>

<p>永遠得不到安樂的日子。此外，他希望政令統一，他說：「任何派系，想分裂政府，都是人民的公敵。我們老百姓一定要反抗。」最後，他更一字一句，滿懷赤誠的說：「諸位代表，應該多尊重人民的利益，少爲黨派的私利打算，這樣，才是眞正的，人民的代表。」</p>
<p>相菊潭先生在致詞中說，他最近接到江蘇的來信，知道</p>
<p>熬受了八年苦難的故鄉父老，今天還是在水深火熱中。今天，他要代表這受難的人民，向協商會議的代表們呼籲，特別對他的老朋友梁漱溟先生，提出一點希望，他希望梁先生能以辦鄉村敎育的精神，在會議席上多講幾句公道話，慈悲話。他期盼着代表們注意維持國家已有的法紀，不能破壞統一，搖動國本。</p>
<p>梁漱溟先生起立致詞了，正如「民主同盟」其他代表在協商會中的說法一樣，他也說「民主同盟」不算一個政黨，他說他不會參加政治，還要幹文化工作，爲了回答相先生的期望，他强調的說：「我相信我的行動，一定不負在座各位朋友們的期望的。」梁先生在這個會塲</p>
<p>面對十六省代表發言，他的態度，似較在大會上審愼的多了。</p>
<p>安徽代表馬存坤先生，他提起中共發表的「和平建國綱領草案」，他說這種要形成割據的主張：「我們人民不同意！」</p>
<p>段永慶先生代表河北省的父老們說話，他也說：不服從政府和平統一政策的，人民要唾棄他們！</p>
<p>陳啓天先生代表靑年黨說明他們在協商會中提出的「軍隊國家化」「政治民主化」的主張，並且相信這次用協商的方式，一定可以求得圓滿的效果。中共代表齊燕明，也相信</p>
<p>人民還鄉的日子應該快要到來了。政府代表陳立夫當天在協商會上第一次發言，在這裏，他仍然以在大會上的誠摯態度，說明當前首要的事情，就是趕快恢復交通，開始和平建設工作。他說：現在中國。正由一黨政治走上多黨政治的道路，在多黨政治形勢下，政黨若有軍隊，國家便永遠得不到和平。</p>
<p>茶會十點鐘結束，陪都停電之夜，適値月光如水，記者仰望到這圓圖的丹亮，才忽然想記距舊曆年只有半個月了，渴待了八年的家人團圓，該就要實現了吧？「白日放歌須縱酒，靑春結伴好還鄉！」這如詩如夢的歡樂，在苦難中流浪了八年的人們，該可以享受到了？</p>
<h3>新匯率與國貨運動</h3>
<p>各方矚目之新匯率，不日行將公佈，市上傳說紛紜，有的猜測美匯約自一千五百至二千之間，更有主張短時內採取自由匯率者。</p>
<p>前提</p>
<p>我人對此與國家前途命脈有關之新匯率，無不寄對以重大之期望，此無他，即希望國人努力發展出口貿易，以取得多量之外匯，換取大量之生產機械，以求主要物品之自給，不再仰給於他國，所以匯率之重訂，應以獎勵輸出爲前提，並絕對預防大量消耗品之輸入。</p>
<p>檢討我國之出口貿易，戰前均以原料爲主。日人以前之輕工業產品，若棉織品等，在海外南洋羣島，菲洲，南美洲等廣大之市塲，自日本潰敗後，我人自可予以利甩，將已接收之敵僞工廠，努力生產，取彼戰前之地位而代之。我國勝利後復典初期，貿易之入超，勢所必然，深望政府能設法加以平衡，同時人民方面，當勵行節約，減少或根除次要之消耗，絕對節省一切舶來品，以保留寳貴之外匯，同時我人仍須提出一句舊口號：提倡國貨。</p>
<p>國貨</p>
<p>「提倡國貨」一語，雖已成二十年來的口頭語，可是請同胞們捫心自問，對此四字，已否切實奉行？尤其是當此勝利後社會上奢靡之風，有加無已，社會人士以享用舶來品爲榮，要知國家經濟和工業的　榮，是建築在全國廣大民衆的消費上，所以提倡國貨，在積極方面講，當喚起工業廠家爭取技術的改進，消極方面，我們當培養人民有愛用國貨的心理。關於「提倡國貨」，我們應該怎樣的促進牠呢？現在姑分數方面路述如下：</p>
<p>社會</p>
<p>我國社會組織，複雜而無系統，此後秩序粗定，地方自治機構行將成立？吾人可利用保甲力量，以推動社會上提倡國貨之風氣。</p>
<p>廠商</p>
<p>勝利後數月中，大後方各工廠崩潰的崩潰，停工的停工。請求政府救濟的救濟，在上海呢，一切國產，都有給海外的廉價品壓倒之勢，進口洋行忙着招徠定貨，我國廠商處此環境，若不發奮自勵，恐怕要被時代所淘汰。對於出品方面，應力求改進，以免造就洋貨侵入之機會，成品售價，要力求低廉，則民衆自然而然的樂用國貨</p>
<p>這樣，美國亨利福特汽車製造廠的「三不主義」，可以給我廠商一個模範：（一）不用廉價的職工，（薪工轉別提高，安定職工生活，）（二）不做八小時以外的工作，（工作時間力求减少，以增進工作效能，）（三）不超過同等貨品的售價，（售價低廉，出品精良，）這一點要看各廠商和勞工的努力協作了。</p>
<p>政府</p>
<p>要統籌一個良好的方案，督促親民的地方政府，領導民衆，推進提倡國貨，要知這一運動，可以打定國家繁榮的基礎，公務員對於日用衣着方面，尤應以身作則，盡量以服用國貨，作民衆之先導。</p>
<p>民國三十四年已經過去，大地春回，百端伊始，甚望我政府對於新匯率之重訂，加以深刻之考慮，並望全國民衆，同心合力，積極推行「提倡國貨」運動。（佚名·移酬助學）</p>

<h3>華僑對國是的具體主張</h3>
<p>政令軍令必須統一，國大代表祗可補充</p>
<p>國家基礎不容動搖，勝利果實不容毀棄</p>
<p>主筆先生：陪都各僑團，爲政治協商會議開會，特致書敬吿全體會員暨全國同胞，願借　貴報披露，藉伸公論爲荷！</p>
<p>政治協商會議，包括社會賢達聲各黨各派人士共卅八人，我海外華僑有千萬之衆，竟不獲陪列議席，敬聆騰論，實感遺憾。惟與會諸公果能本親愛精誠之義，尋求全國統一團結之善道，致國家於富强，則吾人之願望即已滿足，固不必强爭代表，强作主張。今茲會議進行巳歷一週，發言盈庭，團結之道何在？停戰令下，局部衝突尤方興未已，瞻念國族能途，吾人骨鯁在喉，實不得不吐矣！</p>
<p>華僑旅居異邦，寄人籬下，吾人之意念至爲單純，即祖國之統一强盛是已。爲達到此項目的，五十年來，吾人曾襄贊　國父，推翻滿淸，完成民族革命運動。吾人曾贊助國民黨，剷除軍閥，完成民族統一運動。吾人復擁護政府，堅持抗戰，完成民族解放運動。吾人出錢出力，不惜犧牲。此心此志，歷久弗渝。今茲勝利到臨，建國伊始，統一之局面，遽投分裂割據之陰影，團結之陣容，乃有軍事銜突之惡訊。誰在製造內戰？誰在鼓勵內戰？吾人本人民的立塲，早已一目了然。願各黨各派宜傳家幸勿再鼓其如簧之舌，開口人民，閉口大衆，甚至海外僑胞如何如何，皆不足以代表眞正的人民。蓋吾人早已洞察統一團結的癥結所在。惟今日之問題，固不在是非功罪之討論，而爲統一國結的如何確保。惟有統一成功，團結實現，然後纔有和平建國可言。否則和平陰霾，永難廊淸，建國障礙，莫由掃除。一週以來，袞袞諸公，對促成統一有何努力？對鞏固團結有何貢獻？各方的方案，似尚相差甚遠，而有難謀折衷之處。吾人茲願申述華僑對統一團結問題之觀察，並願重新鄭重宣示華僑對祖國統一强盛的强列願望，請分論如左：</p>
<p>第一，統一問題。統一者何，即政府行政權完整行使之謂。與會諸公果有促成統一之誠意，應設法將獨立的政府劃歸中央，自主的軍隊改編爲國軍，以求政令軍令的統一。因爲今日的國民政府，不特爲世界各國所承認，抑且爲各黨派所共同認定其爲統一國家的不可動搖之基礎，但是如何改組「邊區」「解放區」政府，如何改編共黛軍隊以及一切游雜部隊，始爲統一政令軍令的具體步驟。關於後者，巳由軍事三入小組共同磋商，關於前者，各黨派代表何以忽略不談，而斤斤於國民政府機構之改組，是誠不得其解。政府前經宜示開放政權，延攬各方人才，縣級方面亦有實施普選之主張。徵聞民主伺盟梁漱溟會員曾主張將熱魯冀三省特殊化，由各黨派派員組織政府，並主張川滇黔康皆可如此做法，如果可行，試問村治派有幾許人才可當全省大吏之任？張東蓀會員復强指國軍爲黨軍，以爲中共張目。果如所云，我抗戰殉難數百萬官兵，實死不瞑目！張氏在抗戰期間，如非留陷北平而在後方，必會反對國民黨所領導的全面抗戰，而主張逃避兵役，以免爲國民黨所利用。凡此信口開河，不負責任之言論，絕非民主政治之良好表現，且有妨於會議內外空氣之和諧。吾人反對此種節外生枝之謬論，而堅決主張政令軍令之統一於中央政府。</p>
<p>第二，團結問題。團結以民主爲基礎，固不容否認，惟民主須長期之努力，非一朝一夕之功。英國民權遝動之進步，經千數百年之努力，始有今日君主立憲之規模，美國立國雖晚，而其人民來自舊陸，有其運用民權之先天素養。我國建國僅三十四年，內憂外患，迄無寗日，國民黨秉政短短二十年間，削平內亂，領導抗戰，在此動盪當中，訓政自難奏功，當不能一蹴而幾，能與英美先進國家相頡頏。中共固常以邊區解放區參議會爲「人民的民主的」而沾沾自喜，但其是否一黨包辦，以及其民主之成份多少，實不難以常識爲公正之判斷。各黨各派，如必堅持不讓，而爲重選國大之爭，實無意義。且國大代表現有九百餘人，今日之所謂各黨各派，是否具備此九百餘人所代表之人民意志，殊成疑問。吾人認爲國家之事，非比兒戲。國大代表旣經依法選出，尚未執行任務，無論政府或任何黨派均不能以一紙命令作片面的否認，否則國大代表固可起而爲維護民權之爭，廣大的人民仍將爲國大代表之後盾，以求伸張人權，則中國政治糾紛，將永無解決之日。吾人希望政府能作更多之讓步，以更多之名額實行補選。各黨各派如必堅持重選，亦須善自檢討其黨派在國民革命過程中，是否有大造於我國家，而無危害人民之罪行？國民黨有推翻滿淸建立民國削平內亂領導抗戰之偉大功績，而其三民主義建國方略，又爲全國人民甚至各黨派所接受之建國最高指針，人心向背，勝負之數，各黨派亦須稍加思量。吾人以爲在國民大會以前的過渡期間，應宜擴大國民參政會的職權，並擴充其名額，以容納各方賢達，使之成爲近似英美式的民主議會，以善盡其團結全固力量監督政府行政的功能。</p>
<p>第三，華僑對祖國的願望。海外華僑，數百年來在殖民政府統治之下，精神上之痛苦，絕非言語所可形容。尤以滿淸積弱，國家已淪於次殖民地之地位，華僑在外人眼光中，更奴隸牛馬之不若。幸得偉大革命導師　國父孫中山先生領導國民黨，進行民族革命，新中國前途漸露曙光，今</p>
<p>主席蔣介石先生率師北伐，完成統一，抵禦外侮，領導抗戰。不料勝利到來，仍有封建割據擁兵自雄之不良現象。其昧於事理者。更從而推波助瀾，爲地方政權特殊化及變相獨立之醞釀，致使政府一切復員建國步驟，遭受無窮阻碍。吾人堅決擁護三民主義，反對破壞國家民族的統一。千萬革命先烈及陣亡將士拼熱血　頭臚之結果，乃有今日國家之基礎，勝利之果實，不容少數無靈魂的野心家予以毀棄。吾人渴求中國之統一强盛，吾人亦切盼政府行政之善求進步。今日政府行政之大患，爲一部份官吏之貪汚，及紀綱法度之廢弛。吾人熱察國民黨革命奮鬥之歷史，深知國民黨以在朝之地位，負荷國家之重任，不得不廣納人才，乃不免有腐惡勢力及政治上投機份子乘機侵入，致造成官僚主義之作祟，而大部份眞實的國民黨黨員，皆係勞苦舊厲潔身自好之士，對抗戰建國貢獻之大，含茹之勞，非可以宣傳攻訐所可抹殺者。吾人認定，惟國民黨爲有完成建設三民主義新中國之偉大領導力量。吾人於此，甚願有五十年光榮革命歷史之第一大黨善求進步，以肩荷其歷史之使命。</p>
<p>綜上所陳，卑之無甚高論。吾人認定今日政治之必須協商，實由於國內外錯綜複雜形勢交互影嚮之結果，亦爲不得已之舉。蓋今日常戰勝之後，國家已躋列四強之一，國內不容再有紛擾自殘之現象，尤以八年抗戰，淪陷區人民在水深火熱之中，渴望政府前往拯飢救溺，若大旱之望雲霓。政府爲拯救人民收復失土而爲之一切措施，中共自不能託諸解放，分享受降，而出爲阻撓。就令具備任何理由，皆屬遠反政令軍令統一之原則，初非宣傳可以强爲辯解。人民非可鼓惑而昧於眞理之察覺者。二十年來，國內同胞，苦於兵馬，疲於奔命矣！吾人切盼共黨能罷兵休戰，將軍隊交還國家，爲民主政治樹立良好風範。吾人尤盼國共以外其他各黨派，雖非人民之代表，仍須爲國家統一富强人民之康樂福利，善爲主張。切勿以爲國共之矛盾，方爲千載一時之機會，而全力爭其一黨之私。須知政治協商之使命，乃爲謀取全國的統一團結，而非爲各黨派爭政權之塲合。吾人認爲國民黨還政於民，不得還政於黨派的主張，絕對正確。惟有代表民意的國民大會，始可接受政權。各黨各派，絕非人民之代表，惟有透過選舉，經人民推選者，始能代表人民。假令三人一黨，五人一派，皆可左右政治，操持政權，則吾一千萬華僑，可組織千萬黨派，全國同胞，固可組織萬萬黨派，如此，尚得謂爲國家乎？吾人今日開始實行民主憲政之際，在新中國政制史上，不容開此惡例。開會議進行中，曾有諱言分贓一詞者，竊以爲諸公實不必有所諱忌。諸公果爲國利民福而來，抑爲爭官爭代表而來？惟有事實可以說明！人民乃爲最公正的裁判者，會議中一切公開，吾人願聞高論，且拭目以觀其後。願諸公毋忘海外一午萬華橋對祖國統一强盛之衷切願望！願諸公毋忘國內四億五千萬同胞對國家統一强盛之衷切願望！南洋華僑協會，華僑勵志會，中國海外文化事業協進會，旅渝歸國華僑協會，華僑靑年服務事業協進社，華僑互濟社，華僑靑年聯誼會，暹羅華僑互助社，荷印華僑協會，緬甸華僑復員委員會全體會員同啓。（三十五年一月一十日）</p>

<p>社論</p>
<h3>修改進出口稅率問題</h3>
<p>現有種種迹象，可徵政府方面，正發動關稅政策的運用。例如（一）蜂蜜，紅茶，磚茶，粗細夏布，高粱，小米等的免稅；（二）擬減低工業生產機器的進口稅，同時提高一切奢侈品稅率，並傳出口貨稅擬修正爲値百抽七。五，食料進口，除洋米外，將規定爲値百抽一六。五；（三）洋貨的抽稅價格，一律以輸入口岸的躉批市價爲準。諸如此類，雖或已付諸實施，或尚在擬議之中，要皆不失爲運用關稅政策，以達其保護或財政上的目的。我們在受了近百年的協定稅則，協定貨價之後，聽到這種消息，很覺得興奮。</p>
<p>所沒有明瞭的，就不知道今所採取的政策，究竟是保護主義，抑或是財政主義。從上面這種種迹象看來，似乎是兼而有之。例如出口貨値百抽七·五，某種出口貨免稅，進口貨重徵奢侈品，減輕機器稅率，皆含有這種意義在內。</p>
<p>按照目前鈔票發行的狀况，種種臨時費用的膨脹，中國和地方財政的困難，而歲入之中，關稅還是最主要的項目，那麼，與其零零碎碎地去張羅，確不如在關稅方面酌量增抽，於收入上，手續上，倒可以節省無數的麻煩。</p>
<p>至於工業幼稚，生產落後，國產農工貨品非加以適當的保護，斷難與洋貨競爭，這是很明顯的事實。所以上述這兩種主義，相輔而行，我們都無從加以非難。</p>
<p>現在我們要特別提出的，是無論爲收入，爲保護，都要運用恰當，庶不至失掉原來的目標。拿出口貨來說，除非爲本國生產上的需要，原應一律免稅的。今酌抽百分之七·五，其意義當然在於收入。不過此等貨物，如以出口抽稅之故，影響到他的銷路，使他在國際市塲上，不能與他國同類的貨物競爭，那麼，一方面，產業上固然要受到打擊，同時候，稅收上也無從達到預期的目的。所以我們認爲這一類出口稅，似應按照市塲情况，加以適當的調節。或輕或重，似未可單憑主觀來作標準，亦未可完全一律，只圖手續上的便利，舉一例子來說，台灣的樟腦，和湘滇的銻鎢等礦物，其競爭力比較的强，那麼，其稅率酌量加重些，亦無多大妨礙。至於絲經一項，雖說我們主要的勁敵——日絲，已經衰落了，但是現在上海方面所可出口的，據說實不上兩萬祖，而日本積存的絲經，還有三十萬包，戰後已經運到美國去的十萬包，還並不在內（約够美國三個月之用）。加上美國所產的人造絲，近年異常發達，華絲抽稅之後，到底能否恢復銷路，尚未可輕易斷定。</p>
<p>至於進口貨的徵稅，其原因有種種。如果確爲保護，則須先知道：（一）我們有沒有同類的貨物需要保護？（二）所抽的稅率，是否足够保護？換句話稅，我們倘或沒有這一類相同的產品，那麽，根本就無須保護。倘或稅率太低，外貨依舊可以來華競爭，那麼，依舊達不到保護的目的。雖說於財政上不無小補，但已失去了原有的意義了。</p>
<p>所以關稅政策的遝用，我們認爲極其複雜。我們以爲在單純的收入主義，其技術已並不單純，何况在實施保護政策時，自然尤其需要詳密的調查與準備，和各個適當的分別。過去値百抽五的一律辦法，固不適用，即現擬値百抽一六·五的新則，亦還有研討的餘地。</p>

<h3>美軍審判委員會　首次提審日戰犯　原吿辯論官控訴兩大罪狀　改期二星期後再開庭審訊</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕美戰犯審判委員會，昨晨十時在提籃橋監獄，作有歷史性之首次提審日戰犯。</p>
<p>監獄內外戒備森嚴</p>
<p>華德路監獄戒備森嚴，過路四鐵門均有美憲兵，及中國司關共同嚴密看守。新聞記者出入，亦經詳細查閱美軍部特發之通行證。電梯亦由美憲兵司機。四樓東首房間，即爲審判所在。審判官面對室門而坐，右邊爲日戰犯席，左邊爲一部份記者所坐。除日戰犯十八名，審判官五位，被告律師及原告律師二人，日文翻譯官三人，女書記一人外，到各報通訊社記者攝影記者三十餘人，及中美當局旁聽者四十餘人。</p>
<p>戰犯臨審面無表情</p>

<p>十時正，美首席主審官，美軍撤退服務團團長，及美軍需處司令米都頓將軍，偕四陪審官史冰克上校·奧斯特上校·迦度上校·米撤中校入席，審判即開始。首由原告辯論官韋斯中校，宣讀此案乃控訴日戰犯，現十八戰犯均到齊，四陪審官亦並無一缺席，請求庭上開審。法庭之女紀錄員及三日文翻譯員均起立宣誓。韋斯中校又宣續美軍駐華總司令魏德邁將軍之第一公文，請庭上接收。米將軍宣稱公文接受問被告是否反對。被告副辯護官賴維爾上尉，偕另助理辯護官入席謂無反對。一日軍官代表答亦無反對。原告辯護官即行宣誓。米都頓將軍偕陪審官亦宣誓。十八戰犯即全體立正，聽韋斯中校宣讀罪狀二條。塲中空氣極爲嚴肅緊張。章斯中校讀：「在一九四四年十二月十六日左右，此十八職犯（一一提名）在漢口違反戰時法規，及破壞國際公法，故意及非法以慘無人道之殘酷行爲，加害若干美戰俘，彼等眞名不詳確。並將彼等在漢口街市間遊行。又於相同時期，此十八日人並不舉行審訊，而將不知眞名之三美戰俘捋打酷刑，將繼子　勒致死一。</p>
<p>請求改期再行審理</p>
<p>被告辯護官即謂：此控訴已聆悉，首席審判官即問：「被告有何答辯」。被告鄉護官答：「目前無特殊答辯，請求改期再審」。又謂：「被告要求再給予兩星期之久，以作眞確調查。目前辯護律師克金斯上校尚未到滬。余等二人亦係新任，故須請求於二週後再審」。原告起立表示並不反對延期。至此，米都頓將軍即決定於二月七日上午九時再審。</p>
<p>審訊問答灌音廣播</p>
<p>被告辯論官又報告原告另有四日戰犯，因與此案無關，今日並未提案以後另審。此時恰爲十時半，法官首先退庭，然後日戰犯排隊押回，庭散。</p>
<p>出庭後，記者旁聽證仍須檢查，並需交還至美軍部，至二月六日再往領取。又昨日法庭內之一切問答，均由美軍通訊部收省，昨日下午向全球廣播。</p>

<h3>衛生局招待記者　參觀各項設施</h3>
<p>— 本報記者　邁天</p>
<p>本市衛生局，於昨日下午，舉行了一次環城參觀，招待二十餘個記者，分乘兩輛救護車，於下午二時出發，由環境衛生處長兼市立療養醫院院長項經方率領，首先到貝勒路第三區衛生所。</p>
<p>衛生所的工作</p>
<p>第三區衛生所的房子相當講究，以前是法工部局專用來給外國人治病的。中國八的診所呢，設在後面破房十內。衛生所的設立是按照區公所劃分的，共有八所。主要的工作是：〔〕醫藥管理，現在正在開始調查工作。〔二〕環境衛生，對糞便垃圾，街道淸潔，都以最大努力在進行工作。此外檢查食品。每一酒攤，飯店，均採用卡片制度，隨時調查。〔三〕防疫保健，最近有看護六七位，及醫師一位，到各學校種痘，目前已種者有二萬入千人。第二步即到各工廠，大商店種痘，凡滿一百人以上之團體，都可請求派護士前往免費施種。第三區衛生所另外又設性病防治所，待與社會局警察局接洽妥當，妓女檢查，即可開始。現在診所還沒有病床設置，但門診掛號費祇收二十元。產婦科設有出外接生部，每日都派助產士到產婦家接生，收費也極低。他們的社會服務部，特地請了專家到病家調查，給予免費診治。</p>
<p>醫院設備完全</p>
<p>在南市荒僻的多稼路上，市立第二醫院有着一幢極新的房子，那是從敵僞處接收的南市醫院加以很大的經費修理的，現在有病床五十只，以後還要擴充到二百只。院裏的設備都很週詳，透視機是前市政府遺留下來的一架，也是現在市立醫院中僅有的一架。每次透視費爲二百元。善後救濟總譽第二次粉配給區，也設在該院。</p>
<p>大規模屠宰塲</p>
<p>從南市繞了一個大圈子，又到了虹口沙涇路的屠宰塲參觀。一走進門就看見一大堆殺好了的牛，整備送到牛肉舖去。這個屠宰塲是上海最大的一家，民國二十二年十二月五日，由工部局建立。上海人每天吃的牛肉，就是從這裏出來的，現在每天要殺大牛二百八十只，小牛二十只，羊一百四十只。馬二只，猪是在南洋橋屠宰塲殺的。那裏現在代美軍用殺猪每次一百只，每月六七次，牲畜在宰前宰後都經檢騐。牛棚內數千只老牛，垂頭喪氣，在等待着死神降臨，見到這種悲慘的情形，心中不免無感。他們殺牛是先用電在牛兩耳旁一接，牛即被麻醉昏到。在從一長方形的格板中跌下去，然後工人用刀去殺，再由吊着的鐵鈎鈎起，一面將心肺　入一桶內，一面將皮剝下來。每殺一頭牛，祗須十分鐘就可全部完工。屠宰塲內共有三十一只殺牛坑，殺牛費是每只二十元，猪十一元，羊十元。殺猪以前都用機器，現在因爲煤斤不足，不能利用，日人在佔據時亦久未應用。</p>
<p>下屠塲中，工人們正在拿鋸子把一條條殺過的牛鋸成二半，牛脚分開吊在鐵鈎上，鮮血淋漓。牲畜的性命是受到這樣的待遇而了結。</p>
<p>可驚的吸毒者</p>
<p>關北橫浜路八字橋旁，面對小河浜，聲立着一幢三樓灰牆房子，那就是市立戒烟醫院。現有床位七十二只，男女烟民四十一人，戒絕的有二十人。據調查結果，吸雅片的十四人，海洛英的二十五人，嗎啡靜脈注射的二人。吸食的原因也有種種，其中爲應酬而吸上的有十一人之多。據該院當局估計，全上海吸毒的约在六十萬左右。難怪市府當局對於烟民处理的迫切了。</p>
<p>市立療養医院</p>
<p>最后繞到大西路的市立療養医院，那是以前工部局医院的看護宿舍，當你走過大西路上紅房子門口時，你一定會運聲稱贊這大厦的壯偉。裏面的設備那就可想而知了。現在住着療養病人六十個，多數是患肺癆的。特等房有臥室及會客室，每日住院費八百至一千二百元。頭等八百元，三等甲種免住宿費，乙種全免。目前因爲衛生局接收人員無住處，暫借作宿舍，將來預備八樓全部作病房。</p>
<p>每個病房外有個陽台，光綫空氣都十分充足，環境幽靜，這是上海一個理想的養病地方。我們即使不羡慕病人患着的病痛，也得羡慕他們生活在這樣一個舒適的環境裏罷。</p>
<h3>要求改善待遇　各業續有怠工　百貨業調解無眉目</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕永安·先施·大新·新新·麗華·中國國貨·中華·友利等八大百貨公司職工要求改善待遇，已於前日下午二至五時怠工三小時。昨日上午仍未見資方答復，故中午報時汽笛後，再度實行怠工，並有林森中路麗安百貨公司亦於下午二時起參加怠工。據記者探悉：如工潮不即行解決，勞方準備聯合百貨萊職工作萬人遊行。勞方所提之要求，各公司稍有不同，先施·大新·麗華·中華·友利·職工要求最低之薪水爲三萬五千元，股長薪津爲六萬元。永安公司職工要求薪金照十二月增加百分之二百，並實行年級制，每服務滿三年加一成。資方亦採取一致行動，於昨上午十時在社會局參加工資評議會，市行政機關皆有代表出席，據悉：對八公司之職員最低薪津爲三萬元，膳宿自理。至於其他各枝節則由勞資雙方再另行協商，昨日竟日勞資雙方始終未有接觸，勞方表示如再置之不理，則將實行罷工。</p>
<p>理髮怠工可望解次</p>
<p>本市理髮業一千五百餘家，昨日上午十时起，己實行全體怠工，勞方要求，甲等店每日營業收入百分之三十五爲勞方工資，百分之六十五爲資方所得。乙丙等店則勞方爲四成，資方得六成，客人小賬外賞，概由工人分派，店主不得尅扣，並要求每日供給三餐，一粥二飯，資方不得無故開除工人等九項條件。昨日下午二時勞資雙方各派代表由社會局·市黨部會同調解，決議甲等店工方三成半，資方六成半，兩飯一粥，乙丙等店四六分拆，惟每月有工資一千五百元，二粥一飯，取消雜費，其餘膳食照舊。</p>
<p>電力公司明日調解</p>
<p>上海電力公司於前日再度發生怠工後，昨日電力公司各辦事處因職員皆集於楊樹浦總廠，故全日停止辦公。下午五時許總工會代表周學湘，市黨部代表王先靑，社會局代表朱承浩聯袂前往勸導，惟勞方一致堅特非至所有條件資方滿意答覆，決不復工，至於電流保證決不中斷。據聞行政常局己決定於二十六日上午十時在社會局召開最後調解會</p>
<p>商務工潮今日調解</p>
<p>商務印書館全體職工提出要求改良待遇條件後，曾經勞資雙方自行談判無效，已於昨起怠工，推派代表向社會局請願，該局允於令日上午十時召集雙方正式關解。</p>
<p>紡織工人　要求年賞</p>
<p>本市公大裕豐同興等十七家紡織廠工友一萬六千餘人，於十五日紛向三四區棉紡業產業工會提出要求年賞不分等級，一律發給一個半月，並照最近工資結算，及每人發陰丹士林布六碼代替工裝等項，該工會據此，即於十六日以口頭向資方提出，至十九日及二十三日曾以書面提出，然迄無答覆，工友認中紡公司無誠意，遂於昨日怠工，黨政機關立即派員深夜斡旋，聞關於六碼布一項，資方已准予發給，惟年當问題，尚需磋商，定今日上午十時由社會局會同各有關機關召集調解。</p>
<p>吉普司機限期復工</p>
<p>美軍總部駐滬運輸處所有大小吉普卡之華籍司機，銅匠，小工共二千餘入，於本星期二起發生全體怠工，尚未解決。彼等怠工前曾向管理當局請求（一）增加工資二倍，（二）發給年賞一月，（三）加薪後折合美元發給，（四）休息日不扣工資。昨日管理當局發出通知，各華籍怠工人員限於廿五日報到復工，否則另履新工塡補。</p>
<h3>交通上的大動脈　兩路員工嚴守崗位　次秉過去榮譽維護交通</h3>
<p>— 本報記者　惺吾</p>
<p>怒潮般的工潮使每個上海市民感到不安，昨晨各條熱鬧馬路上，又發現了一種綠色鉛印署名「鐵道員工」的傳單，於是傳說紛紜，大家都担心上海的大動脈，也將被捲入工潮的漩渦中。</p>
<p>車站並無工潮徵象</p>
<p>為明瞭事實的眞相，記者特地走訪北火車站，站上一無異樣，也找不到一張傳單，工員們正忙着工作。我拉住了一位，偸偸地問他關於張貼「宣言」的動機，然而出人意外，他竟一無所知，一連數位都如此。他們壓根兒沒有知道什麽傳單，不傳單，一些兒也看不出有工潮要發生的象徵。因此，我又訪問了總站長童士達，承他的介紹，又見到了歐陽秩段長。</p>
<p>段長表示澈查陰謀</p>
<p>他們雖然知道外面有張貼傳單的事，可是還未知道傳單的內容，經我告訴他之後，段長沉默了一會，設：「這一定是以前「華鎭」被辭歇的「黑帽子」榦的陰謀，我們一定要渝查，」並且把最近職工薪金調整表，指給我看，依照行政院的命令共分成四等，每等又分六級，最高的超等一級，是三萬四千元，最低的丙等六級，是二萬一千元，本月份大部份的職工，都加了三級到五級不等，還有米貼和臨時補助費。所以段長說「我們的工資此上不足，比下有餘。」</p>
<p>工會聲明一無所知</p>
<p>同時京滬滬杭兩鐵路工會理事會鄭重聲明，兩路職工的薪給雖然仍舊不足維持生活，但是他們願意循正當手續，呈請交通部予以調整，決不有作任何破壞性的攻訐。關於十六日及昨日所發現攻擊路局的傳單，他們絕對不知道，更不願參加，兩路員工決意維持過去的榮譽，愛護鐵路，嚴守崗位。</p>
<p>各項設施不斷改進</p>
<p>歐陽段長又導往各處參觀，頭二等旅客有候車室，簇新的沙發上坐滿了男女旅客，淡黃色的牆壁上掛着抗戰畫片，有報紙，有畫需，實在可說够完美了！播音室内的小姐，每隔三五分鐘，報告一次，隨時指導旅客，月合上洒掃得　　凈凈，新裝修好的膳章已在京滬。滬杭兩路上服務了。京滬道上的頭二等客車絲絨沙發，是新裝過的。二座位間，還裝上了長桌，可以泡茶，可以吃飯，段長說臥車也快將裝好了，因爲旅客的擁擠，所以極力設法增加客車的節數。現在每列車平均有十四節，比以前已增加了一半，不過還是應付不過來，最可恨的，一般無知識的單帮，常將客車的玻璃窗打破。近來又有「黃牛黨」出現，爲防止黑市票的產生，所以警務處加緊防範。站上每天可以捉到幾個，在種種的限制下，鐵道的設施，還不斷的在改進中。</p>
<h3>纪念福開森博士　请恢復原路名</h3>
<p>美僑福開森博士，服務我國敎育文化實業五十七年，均多建樹。太平洋事變後，曾以協助抗戰工作，被敵拘捕：換僑返美後，終致　疾不起，病逝紐约。其友好王艮仲·奚玉書·徐佩現·表維裕·等，以福氏功在我國，特聯名函請本市市政當局，將被敵僞改稱之福開森路，恢復原名，以資紀念。並將定期舉行追悼。原函略稱，「福開森博士，曾手創金陵大學，並掌敎於本市交通大學　身之南洋公學，樹人作育，英才輩出，迄今蔚爲我國各項事業之基幹。國府定都南京，益奮忠蓋，盡瘁無間。抗戰軍興，福氏激昻大義，對我抗戰工作，更多匡助；坐是見忌敵寇，竟於太平洋事變後積遭逮捕；旋經換僑獲釋，始返故土，終以高年不任凌折，遽爾溘逝。方今勝利來臨，建國經始，國家方事旌彰忠烈，用勵來茲。福氏以盟友立塲，蒞居斯土，計凡五十七年，綜其生平，本大公服務之精神，袪强弱畛域之私見，凡所作爲，類皆裨我國家，利我人民，崇德報功，理無例外。爲發起追悼，藉表景仰。並擬請將本市曾爲敵僞易稱之福開森路，恢復原名，俾垂永念。」</p>
<h3>中宣部代表羅學濂談　電影服務處使命　對外間傳説有所解釋</h3>
<p>最近外間對中央宣傳部所設之中央電影服務處以及該部派員赴收復區接收敵偽影業機構，間有悮傳之處，昨據中宣部駐滬代表羅學濂稱：中央電影服務處之成立，旨在合理發行影片，將所得利潤，扶植製片，免受片商之操縱，其機構及業務，係經中央核准。該處成立己逾二載，並非戰後在滬所設，亦非私人經營，其代影院排片及代理中外影片發行，均出於雙方同意，簽約辦理。</p>
<p>絕非强制。該處所提服務費只限於有合约關係之影院或影片持有人，其取費遠較一般純商業者爲低，一若一般公營事業機構或因成本關係，或因代理作業而酌收手續費然，其爲各機關團體工廠學校放映影片，係因事實上需要酌收機件消耗費（每次收費一千元，最近改爲二千元），放映之影片如係本國新聞片或英美蘇免費借來之新聞片，絕不收費，申請單位，有要求指定放映某片，須向影片持有人轉租。因此有收費數萬元者（最高亦不逾五萬元）此項收費中包括片租機件消耗費，以及機件搬運工作人員交通膳食費等，對申請機關均製給中央核發之三聯收據，對影片持有人亦領有正式收據，一切開支，均係由中央核銷，該處原係戰時組織，在大後方曾收到甚大之效果，將來</p>
<p>是否撤銷或改組，當視需要而定，此次中宣部派員分赴各收復區接收敵僞經營之文化事業機構，電影亦在其內，但均係根據中常會核准公佈之「管理收復區報紙通訊社電影廣播事業暫行辦法」規定辦理，該處並未負有接收任務，僅係將有關業務於接收後交由該處暫行接管，亦係臨時性質，所有接收工作於接收後暫行使用，原爲配合收復區復員工作，亦均經中央核准，其在各影院各製片廠爲接教工作及發動工作對原在敵僞統制下工作之技術人員低級職員，原係爲工作關係，暂予留用，爲數亦至少，正如投降後之日軍辦理移交時之機關或工廠人員因業務上之需用，仍予留用，俾工作不致中　，事出一例。至於滬產電影遵照中央規定，凡在太平洋戰事發生以前在滬製作之影片，其內容不違背現行電影審查標準者，經中央戯劇電影審查所審查核發准演執照後，即可於全國各地公映，其變更片名，自屬影片持有人之應有權利，其在太平洋戰事發生後由敵僞統制所攝製出品，則一律認爲僞片，</p>
<p>絕對禁映抗戰勝利後，該處在內地僅曾爲國產影片辦理申請審查，至代理發行者亦僅有費穆先生之「洪宣嬌」一片，此外並未代理任何國產片，更無所謂偽片。中央對電影事業素具扶植之意，使之配合推進國策，其辦理如有未盡妥善之處，深盼文化界先進以積極態度予以指示，如有經辦人員違法情事，亦盼能以負責態度，提出證據，尚主管機關控訴。</p>
<h3>證劵交易所籌備復業</h3>
<p>華商證劵交易所自奉令處理後，對於籌備復業事宜，正在審愼硏討計劃之中。惟重要設施均須秉承有關當局，由該所理事會決議辦理，關於經紀人名額，目下尙未有所規定。但聞將來承充經紀人之資格，其規定及審查，均十分嚴格。又聞該所籌備復業，恐非最近期內可以實現。</p>
<h3>洛傑尼柯夫獲釋</h3>

<h3>無賴索年賞　連斫十一刀　人犬俱傷</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕雲南路二弄八號王沛風，年四十五歲，前曾爲海上嚮導社老國，於昨日上午十一時二十分許，有無賴數名，至其寓所索取前嚮導社年賞一言不合，即出示菜刀，猛戳其頭部四刀。其時王宅蓄有獵犬一頭，向流氓等在咬，亦被彼擊向狗頭連斫七刀，事後一哄而逸，受傷者送仁濟醫院求治，傷犬舁送亞洲獸醫院診斷。</p>

<h3>金市人心略受打擊　期交跌一萬四　美鈔港票均小</h3>
<p>烚赤昨因陪都行市回小，幷因報載當局對黃金禁做押款之禁令暫緩廢止等訊，人心不無打擊，晨開即退至九二萬三，隔夜浮多紛紛了結，遂自九二萬六後節節下游，一度退至九〇萬七，而後稍轉穩定，直至午刻仍在九一萬五左右盤旋，後市成交更見淸稀，隔日交割一度曾喊高至九二萬二，但不能持久，最後仍在九一萬五內盤旋，結果現交較前收微升九千，隔日交割則同跌一萬四，飾金掛九萬八，紋銀八百元，銀元四百八，仍多賣户，買價四百七，暗拆息仍站住一角至一角三分。</p>
<p>外幣美鈔仍遭實貨所壓制，自一四七五元不斷供過於求，套價始終在六二五元左右出入不一，漸受金市影響，盤跌至一四六〇元以下，午刻在一四六五元左右掙扎，午後仍在原價徘徊，結果較前收回挫一七元，港票因僑匯集中港渙，該地法幣趨漲，老票軋跌五元，新票則因中西各報對新票消息不利，引起脫手之風，回跌二元。</p>
<h3>大户乏力支持　華股走勢向下　外股亦一致後退</h3>
<p>華股續形盤旋，人心不若前數日之興奮，晨開雖與前收相彷彿，不進則退，引起多方了結，大户雖步步爲營，節節抵抗，但大勢所趨，終告不支，永紗自一六四〇元降至一五四〇元，美亞自一一三〇元退至一〇四〇元，三小熱除新光得大户助力，自七三元反步升至八〇元左右，逢低大户及銀行略納，午刻稍見激昻，結果較前收計永紗美亞各挫五十餘元，信和降三十元，景福跌四元，勤興挫二元半，新光則平，中紡挫三十元，永公跌五十元，各冷門亦再遜色。</p>
<p>外股業中人更見戰戰競較，交易沉寂，客户亦鑒於消息不佳，不敢揷足活動，交易在極度秘密下展開，谷股遂感不支而退，午收結果怡紗跌一五〇元，怡啤鋼業各降一百元，業廣五十元，英聯亦跌一百五，會德豐紙業賈價稍退，賣價未有榮辱。</p>
<h3>債市平淡　優面狹窄變化少</h3>
<p>公債低後漸形平定，丙種晨開平平，開後降至一四五〇元而後始轉穩健，惟求供閑散，是以回升至一五八五元，檯面狹窄，大户不欲多事活動，全由散户多空自行軋直，過程毫無特殊變化，雜脾遂鮮有刺激，結果丙戊了以熱門關係而稍漲，甲乙則微跌。</p>
<h3>紡建繼續抛售　紗銷並不減色</h3>
<p>昨日紗市續趨挺秀，綠內地帮交易源源而來，常州布廠對廿支及卅二支原料採辦尤殷，是以便又升高一二萬元，紡建公司續有大量貨額開出，然人心幷不因是而餒，蓋銷路仍有開展之望也。</p>
<h3>人絲互有上落　廠經無大變化</h3>
<p>昨市人造絲榮辱不一，棧單與七五號半光，較無生氣，惟一五〇號求過於供，價最堅穩，一二〇天橋開盤一百十萬元，收盤一百十五萬元，下午相仿，錢單最小做七十一萬元，旋即高升，收盤爲七十六萬元，比上日小四萬元，交易甚淸淡，廠經大市無變化，另担略高一二萬元，調貨大誠格璧縐有人拉抬，最高做每碼二千五百五十元，後做二千四百七十元，美亞被緞及民生織錦緞，仍照上日原盤。</p>
<h3>棉布銷路活</h3>
<p>昨日棉布交易，頗有起色，價亦向榮，各漲一二萬元不等，川帮及漢口帮，以有船即將起椗，爲趕船關係，追逐藍布，襯衫府綢，士林三項現貨甚亟，但坯布根子猶欠圓滑之供應。</p>
<h3>廠帮採辦現棉</h3>
<p>昨日現棉交易尚佳，以華商採辦爲多，計做開四十二支原料美棉高級米得林花價六萬五千元，又次級價五萬八千元，三十二支原料大中集價七萬五千元，二十支原料啓東三餘鎭花價六萬五千元，通州花價五萬七千五百元，以上均送廠價，十六支原料火機籽花售八千元，價較上日穩定，碼頭上未聞到貨。</p>
<h3>米市繼續疲軟</h3>
<p>米市因南北市河下存積湧旺，约有二三百艘，市况呆滯，並聞尚有陳西貢米出售，致人心異常軟化，一致下挫，北粳回跌三四百元，早薄稻跌五百元有零，秈米亦小四五百元，而白元年關雖有需用，奈到源頗旺，反跌五六百元，陰元中下猛落六七百元，麵粉外埠均己停辦，正在結束年終賬務，本街依然淸淡，價亦然下跌二三百元，後形米粉仍少樂觀，油市堅定，豆餅見升百元，黃豆零化轉股，回漲一二百元，生仁提高殺次甚烈，近則汴省歸德開封以及山東靑島路有到貨，酒市以年關需用頗殷，消化甚旺，再漲千元，形勢仍趨挺秀。</p>
<h3>茶價有進無退</h3>
<p>茶市邇因農歷年關迫近，除客帮去化賡續蟬聯外，本街店莊亦有相當納意，人心向上，持貨者扳持，故成交行情有進無退。</p>
<h3>纸價參差將軋平</h3>
<p>洋紙市價高翔，尤以道林紙爲最，按現市與戰前比較，顯有參差，白報紙已至萬倍，道林紙四千倍，牛皮紙三千倍，蓋戰時市價常不以成本爲標準，而以銷路爲依歸，戰事旣定，漸入平時狀態，紙價之參差，亦將軋平，近日道林紙漲風最勁，已徵見此項動機，蓋外國定價，無論何種紙張，皆以戰前之平均爲準，故逆料戰時冷落各貨，亦將漸入熟鬧，蓋上述倍教之參差，勢必自然關整也。</p>
<h3>木材市况平穩　惟安柳價獨秀</h3>
<p>木材市面，一般頗平穩，惟柳安大來貨，價頗堅挺，聞木器帮有去路，致有人搜羅，柳安三夾板亦暗漲，此二種木料爲木材中之標準品，頰有人垂靑，聞柳安圓同己向外洋接洽，價約在美金一百二十元左右可定。</p>
<h3>商情摘要</h3>

<p>化工原料全日成交淸稀，買賣雙方均抱觀望態度，燒碱逢低有吸户，價見站穩。</p>
<p>針織品昨日交易較濃，惟所注重者，皆夏令貨品，如汗衫及襪子，價比上日爲昻。</p>
<p>銅錫市况，以時値　結束期近，交易閑散，行情以執貨者心思樂觀，多不願脫手，靑鉛每祖沽三五〇〇〇元，字鉛四〇〇〇〇元間。</p>

<p>日用品肥皂因有平價皂發售，銷路轉稀，徵見下挫，火柴傳二期平價貨，不久可開售，亦見疲軟，洋燭則稱有變動。</p>
<h3>鋼板缺貨</h3>
<p>市上鋼板存貨，原屬有限，近來更因造船廠採辦，底貨益形淺薄，尙再殷勤添購，則愈求愈涸，一時恐有靑黃不接之虞，時下五厘七厘半一分諸花色，每噸喊六十萬元，較前好起幾達偣許，分半二分亦喊高至五十萬元。</p>

<h3>戰後社敎新動向　掃除文盲改併民敎　社敎機關補敎兼施　首都將辦補習學校</h3>
<p>〔本報重慶特訊〕社會敎育爲掃除文盲，在戰前所辦之成年失學民衆學校，自二十九年國民敎育法令頒布之後，已將衆成年失學敎育改在國民學校設成人部辦理之。</p>
<p>國民學校</p>
<p>凡各縣於鄕鎭設一中心國民學校，於各保各設一國民學校，上述兩種國民學校，皆分設兩部，一爲兒童部，一爲成人部，成人部之失學民衆敎育，旣附屬於國民學校之中，所有社敎機關，即更進一步辦民衆深造之補習敎育，自高小以上，至初中高中，以及專門職業之補習訓練，有農工商各科。</p>
<p>補習學校</p>
<p>陪都方面，早已在重慶及郊外鄕村設有補習學校及分校，與工塲附設之校，共計约分二十班，學生有二千人之譜。此項補習學校，於抗戰勝利敎育復員之際，敎部擬在首都亦創辦之，以助推進，正在規畫之中，惟數年以來國民學校兼辦成人民衆敎育之成績，據查各省市進行程序滯滯，尙多未合標準。</p>
<p>民衆學校</p>
<p>現值各收復區敎育復員工作廣開，此後除利用播音敎育，與電化敎育外，仍擬督導各社敎機關附設民衆學校，多方策進，以期早目掃除文盲。並聞戰前所用之民衆學校課本久經改訂，分爲成人班課本，與婦女班課本，共計八册，將由指定書局聯合公印處承印發行云。（安）</p>
<h3>敎次杭立武談　京臨大學潮</h3>
<p>〔中央社訊〕敎育部常務次長杭立武，日前自京抵滬，昨與記者談稱：南京臨大補習班學生　辱主任王書林事件，業已告一段落，各敎授曾一度罷敎，在大多數學生要未復課聲中，已繼續執敎，至於肇禍學生，現由法院處理，結果如何，此係司法問題，吾人無從過問。杭氏繼稱：此行除籌設中英文化協會上海分會外，將視察臨大補習班及其他學校云。</p>
<p>〔本報南京二十四日電〕聞收押之臨大肇事學生，有今晨絕食訊。</p>
<h3>武漢廣州大學生　將設班補習</h3>
<p>〔大華社南京訊〕敎育部爲整頓收復區學校，提高敎育水準，曾先後在南京，上海，濟甫，北平等地，設立臨時大學補習班，收容收復區內各大學學生，予以補習機會，俾將來得轉正式大學，取得合法學籍。近該部以武漢廣州兩地。尚有多數學生未能享受此種優待，特定日內派員前往各該地調查實况，予以設立。</p>
<h3>滬市小敎職員　資歷人數统計</h3>

<p>〔本報重慶二十四日電〕公敎人員待遇，業經調整，自本月份起，已確定爲生活補助費三萬元，薪金仍按一百倍計算。但取銷米代金。</p>
<h3>中大遷校經費　核准廿萬萬元　蓉醫學院將會同東下</h3>
<p>〔大華社重慶杭訊〕中大復員委員會，工作已逐漸展開，五組負責人亦已選出，調查組張更敎授，交通組孔良規敎授，工程組未定，財務組洪範五，庶務組則由楊總務長兼任。惟校方頃接軍政部電，擬借南京校舍六個月，因之同學頗爲不安，爰該校南京校舍，尚未完全接收，且一部份已借與臨時大學，大部房屋均須修繕，傢具桌椅亦須重新添置，若將校舍完全借出，則今夏遷校將成問題，且該校學生前僅千餘人，現已增至五千餘，原有校舍即使全部接收，亦不敷應用，故校方已請求善後救濟總署撥與美國活動房屋六百間，作爲學生宿舍。至於遷校經費需用頗巨，前曾呈請敎部撥發六十萬萬元，現已核准二十萬萬元，添建校舍，恐亦不敷甚巨。幷聞該校成都醫學院，於四月初結束後，四月底先來重慶，會同東下，另一說，則謂俟隴海路暢通後，先乘汽車至寳雞，而後換乘火車轉京。</p>
<h3>海源閣藏書　日內將運平</h3>

<h3>轟隊籃球隊　擊退美野貓隊　另幕東華敗於雪愛拉</h3>
<p>昨日下午七時起，國軍機械化部隊第二營組織之轟隊籃球隊，征滬第一戰，逢美海軍野貓隊，陜西路畔，盛極一時。</p>
<p>轟隊與野貓開始作戰，雙方均用蠻幹窮拼法，上半時一六對一三，轟隊佔前。下半時轟隊頗能在剛中取柔，野貓一味蠻幹，於是轟隊終以三〇對二三取勝。轟隊球藝，相當可觀，惜乎今明日即將離滬，不勝令人依依惜別。</p>
<p>雪愛拉與東華之戰，雪隊以人長佔先，上半時三五對一七，雪愛拉佔絕對優勝。結果雪愛拉以七五對四一大勝東華焉。</p>
<h3>市長盃足球賽　十二隊參加</h3>

<h3>今日籃球聯賽　梁溪戰恩卡斯　女組雪白對强華</h3>
<p>今日籃球聯賽，自六時半起在市體育館有三塲交綏，雪白與强華之女組先行交鋒，雪白係民立女中之學生軍，當能取勝。第二塲原定東華職同仁，以故改綠林戰同仁，同仁因隊員中有重病及離滬者，今日之是否能出塲，殊成問題。末塲梁溪有新人加入，恩卡斯係前蒙諾克之化身，相當萬害，今日之秩序如左：雪白……强華（女子）六時卅分綠林……同仁（甲二）七時一刻梁溪…恩卡斯（甲一）八時一刻</p>
<h3>西南聯大羣相（上）</h3>
<p>— 沈石</p>
<p>西南聯大，這抗戰期中，北大淸華南開的聯合產物，挺立西南八載，盡了它獨特的使命，盡了它應盡的責任。它，經過更番的逃徙，挨過幾度的狂炸，始終元立，始終弦歌不絕，荆棘，辛酸，鑄成了輝煌燦爛充滿血淚的校史。它告訴人們，守成是怎樣不易，創業更顯得艱難。它告訴人們，堅定的信心，大無畏的毅力，才能够奠定戰時教育，才能够保存文化命脈。它掙扎，創造，傳得了海內外的關懷，贏得了國人一致讚譽。多少靑年，多少男女，闖過封鎖，穿過敵陣，投入這自由的園地，盡情學習，盡情研究，我們靜聽那莊嚴的校歌：「萬里長征，辭別了五嶺宮闕，暫駐足，衡山湘水，又成離別」，幾度凄凉，無窮哀感，「竟笳吹弦誦在山城，情爾切」，多麽引人入勝，多麽增人嚮往，「待騙除仇寇，復神京，還燕　，」對國家前途，充滿了希望和信念。抗戰勝利了，我凝望北國的雲天，我沉思西南的水光山色，我情不自禁地要爲在鐵蹄下苦度多年的父老兄妹，報首這西南最蒿學府的慘淡經營，報道它多年來的風流韻事。</p>
<p>聯大的結合</p>
<p>抗戰初起，北大，淸華，南開在長沙小吳門外聖經學院組成了臨時大學，因着戰局的緊張，臨大決遷昆明。一部分師友由香港海防去昆明。一部分同學在勤苦的親切的曾昭掄敎授領導下，跋涉新修成的西南公路，徒步到達昆明。借用昆華農校的校舍，繼續開課，長沙臨時大學改稱西南聯合大學，並增設師範學院，大西門外的新建校舍完成，校本部，文法理三院進入新舍，工學院設在城東拓東路。</p>
<p>聯大用常務委員會代替了校長，常委三人，由三大學校長充任。張伯苓先生老了，到校的機會很少。對內的一切，經常由梅貽琦先生主持。對外的一切，由蔣夢麟先生負責。感謝三位常委先生，由於他們的互信互議，由於他們的相忍相成，促成龐大的聯大「聯而合」，從沒有私見，從沒有齟齡，成千的師生，載歌載舞，融融洩洩，追求眞理，創造新生命，新學風。</p>
<p>常委會雖然是學校最高行政機構，決定校務的，却大半是敎授選舉代表組成的敎授會議。敎授會議眞的値得讚頌稱羨，由於他們高度發揚民主作風，克服了重重困難，由於他們人格崇高，學問淵博，賦有繼承自由傳統，創建新文化的使命，使學校和地方當局融洽，使萬千學子拳拳服膺，心悅誠服，更使三校學風和精神互相調和，進一步助長了「聯而合」。</p>
<p>聯大的師友，來自海外，來自國內每一角落，操着不同的方言，但聚會時，即使蹩脚的國語，也得說出，生活起居的方式雖有不同，但在追求眞理下共同研究學習，表現得特別友愛親切，無形中增進了「聯而合」。八年來的聯大，在教育史上佔有光榮的一頁，它的發展，證明了優良學風的培育，要有一貫的高度的自由的民主精神，說明了政治的安定，在容忍，在開誠布公，在實事求是，也就說：祇有民主，才能展開政治的新生。</p>
<p>敎授的典型</p>
<p>聯大雖然僻處昆明，外在的阻力却重重，虧了梅蔣兩先生的煞費苦心，終能兀然屹立，但維繫學校的眞正力量，却在德高望重的敎授。他們道德崇高·誠擎·熱情，誨人不倦·以德化人。他們學識湛深，在課堂，在實騐室，在山野探採，用整個精力去啓發，去探求。物價驚人的高漲，他們生活淸苦，都能安貧樂道，自然博得學生敬服。詩人聞一多先生，除了在昆華中學兼課外，還得就鐫刻圖章，彌補家用的不足，隻身出入大涼山若無人烟地帶的袁復禮先生，家中小孩特別多，書籍用物早就賣光了，每天祇能吃兩頓稀飯。道貌岸然的老哲學家金岳霖先生，自美國講學歸來，和錢端升先生同住一屋，爲了雇不起佣人，還得帮助錢太太劈劈松柴，在某一次，昆明舉行的哲學年會上，金先生用幽默而沈痛的語調，慨嘆西洋哲學在國內研究乏人，哲學年會的經費又特別的短少，比起工程師學會的經費眞相形見絀，但兩者對人類的貢獻，那祇有天曉得了。剛直敢言的政論家張奚若先生，自從在獨立評論發表轟動一時的冀察不　特殊化的宏論後，雖在參政會上幾度發言，在校中老是保持沈默，鼓勵學生多充實自己，少寫壁報，他曾遭遇房東副官的毒打，同學們都爲他抱不平，聽說張先生近年不緘默了，他為了國家前途，充分表現他的正義感，他講演時，敎室裏擠滿了人，窗十外擠滿了人，他寫的文章，人人搶着買，人人爭着讀。精通中西史的雷海宗先生，和靄可親，因爲貧血，曾在馬路上昏倒，他的太太却在雲大充一名小職員接濟家用。名生物學家陳楨先生終日守在實騐室裏，和顯微鏡親熱，他有巴士特的精神和耐性，我祝讀他在科學上的成功。佛學權威湯用彤老敎授，頭髮銀白，終日深研佛學，不大公開講演，但他一走上講壇，敎室內外老是充滿了人。更應該値得提及的是吳雨僧先生最敬佩的哲學·史學·文學大師陳寅恪先生，他戴着圓頂的瓜瓢帽，閉上眼睛，端端正正地坐了講學，語調那麽輕微，坐在下面的人聚精會神的靜聽，吳宓、沈有鼎、劉文典諸先生都去聽他的玄論，逢人就道及他，稱頌他，本來陳先生在戰前榮膺牛津大學名譽講座，因爲體弱不能前往，只得留在昆明當昆市遭受猛炸時，陳先生跑不動，去香港大學敎學，香港淪陷，敵寇震於陳先生之名望碩學，曾餽送麥粉，陳先生以死拒，敵寇也無可奈何，陳先生的尊翁散原詩人在北平絕食死難，可見他們父子的大義凛然了，陳先生後來脫險移住佳林，桂林丟了，逃往成都，戰爭結束時，陳先生飛英講學，聽說他過昆明，還有沈痛的悲感呢。聯大的精神就在這些地方，敎授們必要時以身護道，以身殉道。</p>
<p>華萊十評語</p>
<p>他們愛國家，希望國家强大，趕上時代。他們愛學校，力求學校光大，他們一貫的目標，在護衛傳統的自由講學，自由研究的優美學風，在追求光明正義眞理，如果眞理和自由學風遭受不幸，他們不惜用生命來維護。這樣使聯大光芒萬丈，吸引住遠道的學生，歷萬水千山，投奔到學術上的自由國地當歐陸遠東瀰漫德日法西斯細菌時，美國前任副總統華萊士先生到了中國，在聯大發表動人演說，讚譽聯大爲「東亞僅存的民主堡壘」，無疑的，這是聯大的光樂，但它並不以此自豪，它希望民主政治普及各國，那慶世界才有眞的和平，眞的繁榮，人類才有眞正的幸福。</p>

<h3>對牛彈琴</h3>
<p>— 宋壽昌</p>
<p>「對牛彈琴」原是一個對禺人談深理的比喻，這比喻雖屬無積，却很可以玩味，本來音樂不一定是人類能够理解，其他有聽官的動物，也能够感受音樂的，達爾文（Darwin）　在他的人種原始論裏這麼說：「音樂藝術的起源，就是雄物籍以招引雌物的一類東西。」他的推論，以爲雄性動物的大部分多在繁殖期間使用他們的聲音；叫的時候，一方面在於發洩他們的感情，另一方面則在於引起雌性的注意。可見雄性動物的鳴或叫，要是雌性的不能感受音樂，怎麼會被吸引呢？</p>
<p>在尙書舜典篇裏，也有關於音樂感動獸類的話：「帝曰：蠻，命汝興樂，敎胃子，直而溫，寛而栗，剛而無虛，謂而無傲。詩言志，歌永言，聲依永，律和聲，入音克諸，無相奪倫，神人以和。要曰：於予擊石拊石，百獸率舞。」這話好似這位樂家藝有點自誇他的技巧，可是我們一看現代的馬戲團，那些四獸類的表演，似乎使獸舞是可能的事。研究這種訓練的成功，還是靠着音樂的效果，用音樂的節奏的快慢和緩念，音調的高低抑揚，暗示牠們的種種動作，一切的表演，全然跟着音樂的誘導，進退起伏都是合着拍子，最兇猛的老虎和獅子，被馴服得像貓一般，最笨重的象也好像有靈性似的，這都是由於音樂的力量，使獸類受了音樂的感動而共鳴。</p>
<p>音樂有一種同化作用，因爲音的高低强弱的變化，和生理有關，速度的快慢都是以生理的要件做基礎的，所以聽了音樂能够受着影響與它同化起來。如拍子的速度根基於吾人的脈搏的，對於音樂的刺激便覺得舒適，同時聽音樂的時候，必然在精神上，肉體上都受着音的暗示，才能確實地享受音樂的美。例如聽喇叭的聲音，發生振翼高飛的感覺，因爲喇叭的聲音，能够使人四肢擴張起來；聽到鼓的聲音，會起一種緊張激烈的感覺，因為鼓的聲音，能够使人熱烈興奮。音樂的感覺與吾人精神上，肉體上的關係如是，便可以應用於四手獸類的動作的訓練。我們從達爾文的推論與這種事實看來，有的動物，的確能够感受音樂的，不過，牠們的理性不及人類，那末，牠們聽音樂的能力，自然較人類爲低，能够感受的音樂，祗是聲音響亮，節奏直率的罷了。</p>
<h3>淩廷堪論曲絕句疏證（下）</h3>
<p>— 趙景深</p>
<p>仄語纖詞院本中，惡科鄙諢亦何窮。石渠尙是文人筆，不解俳優李笠翁，</p>
<p>吳炳（石渠）雖多仄語纖詞，究不愧爲文人之筆，李漁（笠翁）十種曲中，什麼探的齷齪話都說得出來，簡直像戲子一樣，從這幾句話，可見凌氏不喜歡李漁，更過於吳炳。</p>
<p>婁東辛苦變吳歈，良輔新聲玉不如。</p>
<p>誰向岐陽慕石鼓，世人爭效換鵝書。</p>
<p>嘉靖年間，太倉（婁東）東關的魏良輔改良崑腔，把它變得極爲動聽，「疾徐高下淸濁之數，一從本宮，取字齒唇之間，迭換巧掇，時時以深邈助其悽淚」，因爲他的成功，像是王羲之那能够換鵝的字一樣；於是靡然從風，當時的海鹽弋陽等腔都被打倒，沒有人去慕周宣王時史籀所刻的石鼓，大家都用崑腔來唱傳奇雜劇了。</p>
<p>一字沉吟未易安，此中層折解人難。</p>
<p>試將雜劇標新異，莫作詩詞一例看。</p>
<p>「吟安一個字，撚斷數根鬚。」雖是本色的雜劇，寫成以後看看，好像不費力似的；恐怕在製作時也化了不少推敲的工夫，纔有這渾成的結果的吧？用力而被人家看不出用力，這就成功了。曲有別腸，與詩詞逈然不同：這一點是凌氏極爲注意的。</p>
<p>語言氣辨須眞，比似詩篇別樣新。</p>
<p>拈出進之金作句，</p>
<p>風前抖擻黑精神。</p>
<p>原註云：「抖擻着黑精神，扎撤開黃髭䯮，康進之黑旋風負荆端正好曲也，」精神而稱爲黑，的確極爲新穎，按此二句見康進之，「梁山泊李達負荆」第二折。</p>
<p>半窗明月五更風。</p>
<p>天寳香詞句浪工。</p>
<p>底事五言佳絕處。</p>
<p>不敎移向晚唐中。</p>
<p>原註云：「王伯成天寳遺事；半窗千里月，一枕五更風：似晚唐人詩，于曲終不類也，」天寳遺事諸宮調，我曾據雍熙樂府，九宮大成譜北詞廣正譜，北宮詞紀等輯得五十餘套，此二句見雍熙樂府卷四點絳唇套，題作「明皇哀告葉靖」，首句是「人世　淸」。這一首也說詩詞曲各有界限，未可混同。</p>
<p>前腔原不此么篇。</p>
<p>南北誰敎一樣傳？</p>
<p>若把笙簧較弦索，</p>
<p>東嘉詞好竟徒然。</p>
<p>凌氏是北曲的崇拜者，所以本首說北勝於南，若數腔相同，則第二曲以下，南曲稱爲前腔，北曲稱爲么篇，南曲的樂器用笙餐，北曲的樂器却用弦索，高明（東嘉）的南曲琵琶記任怎麼好，總之是不及北曲的校禮堂文集中有南北曲論一篇，匆匆未能細讀。</p>
<p>諧聲製譜幾人讀？</p>
<p>徐沈分鑣論北南。</p>
<p>白介云科渾不辨，</p>
<p>浪傳于室與寗庵。</p>
<p>徐于室有北曲譜，我還不曾見過。我只見過九宮正始，似與徐于室有關，但這却是南曲譜。沈璟（寗庵）的南九宮十三調譜，有北京大學石印本，較易得。沈璟作有義俠記（六十種曲本），博笑記（傳奇三種本），埋劍記（北平圖書館本），桃符記（精抄本），對於白介云科，甚爲留心。說他浪得聲名，似乎下妥。</p>
<p>即空三籟訂南聲，</p>
<p>騷隱吳騷亦有情。</p>
<p>更與殷勤編曲品，</p>
<p>羨他東海鬱藍生。</p>
<p>這一首無甚深意，只是指出一些曲選和曲評：凌初成（即空觀主人）的「南音三籟」，騷隱生的「吳騷合編」，以及東海呂天成（鬱藍生）的「曲品」。騷隱生許是張旭初的別號吧？因爲吳騷合編劵首的「作家偶評」可說是和增補曲苑上騷隱生的「衡曲慶談」完全一樣的。</p>

<h3>淚</h3>
<p>— 驚沉</p>
<p>夜是凄凉的，對着無邊的寂寞，抖然的想起了Verlaine的話：「一想到過去，我就要哭了，」默默的問着自已；我也曾有過可以哭泣的過去麼？以往我有過多少次幽靈似的暗泣？</p>
<p>唉—這是一些難言的事實，在嚼着我底脆弱的心靈啊！</p>
<p>廣漠的世界中，可曾有一個願意了解我的人？走遍了人心的邊緣，找不到生命的源泉，何處是泉流呢？</p>
<p>「戰鬥下去吧，爲什麼一定要人了解呢？」是的，這種榮耀是歸那些有毅力的人，然而我却爲這而哀泣了。</p>
<p>我並不冷酷，我並不缺少愛的火燄，我還有一顆熱情而純潔的心，這些我都願把它獻給一個人，然而，誰會誠懇的接受呢？我又把全部的愛獻給誰呢？</p>
<p>「能够體騐的悲哀，這人生也是幸福，」如果有這樣的事，我願拭乾我底眼淚的。</p>
<p>但，淚！暢快的流吧！</p>
<p>失去了春的溫暖，還會來嗎？記得巴南約席先生曾說：一春天會來的！還有無數個美麗的春天，」果眞如此嗎？難道來的會比失去了的還多嗎？</p>
<p>我像一個修道的聖處女，她並不奢望愛的溫暖，然當春天幾度的捫着她底心扉，當她神往於那美麗的誘惑，情不自禁的伸出擁抱的手時，而希望却悄悄的溜走了，留給她依然是永生的孤寂，那難耐的孤寂呵！年靑脆弱的心在哭泣了。</p>
<p>流淚並不一定是孺弱者的表現，因爲倔强的人流着倔强的眼淚呢？「眼淚會使我更堅强些，」眼淚亦帶來戰鬥的力量呢？弱者隨着眼淚倒了下去，而强者隨着眼淚站了起來。</p>
<p>拭乾你的眼淚，即使痛苦的，也得忍受，因爲這已不是流淚的時候了。」</p>
<p>戰鬥的日子來臨了，那麼拭乾它吧</p>

<h3>推荐「余凱集藏賀年片展覽會」</h3>
<p>— 溫肇桐</p>
<p>假使承認藝術的範圍不單是書畫音樂之類，那麼含有藝術趣味的蒐集和收藏，也正是藝術活動的一種。</p>
<p>微細的如各國歷代的郵票，它不僅可以觀察各國各時代的歷史，經濟，政治等的演變，而且每一枚郵票在色彩上，紋樣上，便可表現一個國家一個時代的藝術風格，所以我們對于郵票的收藏根本不能認爲是一種玩古董，或是一種考俗據的工夫，而簡直應該認爲是一種藝術的活動。</p>
<p>余凱的萬國賀年片與明信片的收集，到現在祗就數量上看，八萬種這個數目，已够驚人，而且，在這裏我們可以欣賞到東西洋美的觀念的不同，藝術形式的逈異，古典的趣味，摩登的風格，………這種種，簡直是中外古今藝術發展的跡象，在欣賞者的目光中，決不能認作它是毫無價值的一枚賀年片或明信片的累積，因爲這是一種藝術的活動。</p>
<p>藝術不一定是書畫音樂之類，在我們生活的周圍，便有許許多多的藝術品可以被我們發現，整理，欣賞，研究，余凱便是走向這「條路棧的藝術工作者。愛好藝術的朋友，對于這一次他的萬國賀年片明信片展覽是值得予以注意的。</p>
<h3>絃歌者</h3>
<p>— 畢西昌</p>
<p>月上黃昏，我閒倚在一角小樓。　丁東丁東的絃索聲，從遠處漸漸移近，由微弱的音調漸漸增强，突破了我縹渺的心靈。　黑憧憧的人影，悄悄地出現在冷落的街頭，是在一個贏弱的老者，抱着一張七弦琴，悠然自在的不斷地奏那無人賞識的音曲。蒼凉的琴聲，好像爲他傾訴出身世的飄零，世事的滄桑……</p>
<p>他瞞珊地走渦路燈下，暗淡無力的燈光，終掩飾不住他憔悴的容顏。</p>
<p>邊飄着蕭蕭的白髮，面上湧着鄰鄰的波紋；這該是靑春換來的代價，這該是時代給予的紀錄。</p>
<p>我低徊尋思，平添了無限惆悵。</p>
<p>那蒼凉的絃索聲，不爲我而暫駐，終於標　中消逝了。</p>
<p>只有　　的餘音，還深深地扣住了我的心弦。</p>
<p>啊！絃歌者，茫茫大地，何處找你的知音。</p>

<h3>「原子時代」</h3>
<p>— 謝東平</p>
<p>人類的智慧，在時間上深深的刻上了一個痕跡：現在是原子的時代了。</p>
<p>原子彈的威力，只有日本人才領略過。以後，原子能那個東西，到底用在什麼地方：提高人類的文化，還是毀滅人類的文化，誰也不能够提出保蹬。</p>
<p>現在，我們總要感謝原子彈，感謝發明原子彈與應用原子彈的人的勇敢與大智。它的輕輕一用，至少使敵人的無條件投降，提早了一年。這可以少犧性多少生命，少消耗多少物資？</p>
<p>有人說，中國現在正逢到筆桿兒與槍桿兒爭的時會。參加政治協商會議的某會員說：「在歷史上，筆桿兒與槍桿兒爭，筆桿兒總是勝利的。」這或者因為人究竟是人，他有智慧有理性，能自覺，如果人是猫與狗的話，那筆桿兒與槍桿兒爭，筆桿兒準敗北。筆桿兒的勝是勝定了，但我們爲了提前勝利，爲了减小「爭」的犧牲與消耗，我主張用筆的人也利用利用原子能，假如「筆」是代表光明與眞理，槍是代表黑暗與罪惡，那未，我們向黑暗進攻，向罪惡進攻，爲什麼不可以用原子彈？</p>
<p>現在的沙塲上，放「冷槍」的時代已經過去了；現在的文壇上，只是偷倫撲摸，隱隱約約，只是含沙射影，而不敢明朗的寫出來的時代，也已經過去了。</p>
<p>社會上的貪官汚吏，巨奸大惡，數千年的壞傳統裏裏外外的惡習慣，你不用原子彈怎麼消滅它們？</p>
<p>原子時代，要用原子彈，這是天經地義的。</p>
<h3>雙宿雙飛（九）　（四）</h3>
<p>— 趙清閣</p>
<p>墨太太經過一番生死關頭的掙扎以後，如今算是平安地恢復了寗靜。她偎緊了身邊的小嬰兒，她感到一種特別的溫暖。四年以來，她的生活枯燥得使她常常煩悶，她早需要一個新的孩子，來塡補她的心靈上的一部分空虛！尤其她希望有一個女兒。如今好了，她完全滿意地如願以償！</p>
<p>翁二太太正忙着安排嬰兒的尿布，衣飾。墨太太看着怪過意不去的，因此感激地向她說：</p>
<p>「你該歇歇了，我的好妹妹！仔細累壞身子，你也不方便哩！」</p>
<p>「不要緊，姐姐！我還早的很！」翁二太太說着，不禁臉上飛紅了起來。</p>
<p>翁二太太確是也懷了孕，因爲她這還是第一胎，所以她除了讓墨太太一個人知道以外，連翁老爺她都不告訴。但是究竟瞞不了翁老爺，翁老爺早看出來了。</p>
<p>「墨太太看見翁二太太有些害羞，便問她：</p>
<p>「翁老爺還不曉得嗎？快告訴他吧，告訴他了，也好有個照應。」</p>
<p>「照應我？」翁二太太冷笑地說，「成天照應他的鴉片烟混就够忙的啦，還有工夫　照應他？」</p>
<p>「嗨！男人都是一個樣的地賬！我們的這位老爺十還不也是成天只知道喝酒！你沒瞧見，我們這兒忙了大半天啦，還沒見燈的鬼影子哩！」</p>
<p>剛說到這兒，寳鈴闖了進來。他已經聽見她們又在咕墨老咱了，所以故意地打斷了她們的話岔兒。</p>
<p>「媽！讓我瞧瞧妹妹！」爺鈴說着，就撲到嬰兒身上天眞寳叫起來。「妹妹！妹妹！」</p>
<p>「別吓着她了，寳鈴！」墨太太說。「去給你爸爸倒杯然茶來！」</p>
<p>「爸爸？爸爸在外面！他也來看妹妹了！」寳鈴故意打岔地說。</p>
<p>「小兔崽子！我呌你去給你乾爸爸倒杯茶來，怎麼就聽不明白呢！」墨太太駡着說。</p>
<p>其實寳鈴何嘗沒聽明白。這孩子調皮，他早明白墨太太所指的爸爸並非墨老爺，他不過是存心否定這個稱呼，才假裝沒聰明白。倒是墨太太不明白他的用意。如今逼得墨太太只好加了個「乾」字，寳鈴心裏這才服了。於是勝利地笑着向翁二太太說：</p>
<p>「乾爸爸，您先等着，我這就去給您泡茶來。」</p>
<p>寳鈴走後，翁二太太笑着說：</p>
<p>「寳鈴這孩子越長越像他爸爸了！不但長的像，連神氣兒都像。」</p>
<p>「就因爲這個，我不大喜歡寳鈴了！誰知道，我竟恁麼恨那個死老頭子。」</p>

<h3>The Constitutional Draft Issue Can Be Resolved Smoothly; Political and Military Matters Still Require Negotiation; Comprehensive Group Holds Second Meeting Today</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Chongqing, 24th] Yesterday, the deliberations within the various groups of the Political Consultative Conference (PCC) took a temporary turn for the worse. The Communist Party (CCP) in the Military Group proposed a joint military commission; the CCP in the National Assembly Group insisted on re-elections for the old representatives; and the Democratic League also abandoned its veto proposal, endorsing the CCP's re-election proposal. Only the Program Group had similar views, reaching agreements on restoration, disaster relief, education, and culture. This situation only improved after the first meeting of the Comprehensive Sub-committee was held at 4:00 PM. The National Assembly Group proceeded with the allocation of newly added representatives; the Military Group still lacked progress; and the other three groups remained unchanged. Today, the Military and Constitutional Draft groups will continue their discussions, and the Comprehensive Sub-committee will hold its fourth meeting at 4:00 PM. Furthermore, after hosting a banquet for the delegates last night, Chairman Chiang had a discussion with Zhou Enlai, Zhang Junmai, Zeng Qi, and others. The CCP and the Democratic League also held separate meetings until late at night, the contents of which are unknown, but there is still no news as to when the general assembly can be convened. Public opinion believes that the success or failure of the conference hinges on the achievements of the Comprehensive Sub-committee and the Military Trio Group.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Chongqing, 24th] The Military Group of the Political Consultative Conference held its fourth meeting today, continuing the discussions and making some progress compared to yesterday. However, during the third meeting yesterday, the discussion on the restructuring of military authorities was lengthy and quite contentious. Some members believed that military institutions must be thoroughly reorganized to accommodate people from all sides in order to guarantee the implementation of nationalization of the military. Points on which agreement could not be reached were temporarily set aside. Moreover, the most difficult problem originally in the PCC, the validity of the old National Assembly representatives, is no longer an issue in the Comprehensive Sub-committee. Negotiations on the constitutional draft can also be resolved smoothly. The current focus is on the Political and Military Groups, and only after the two groups reach a consensus can the Program Group achieve a satisfactory resolution. This morning, the Political, Military, and Program groups held meetings simultaneously. This afternoon, the Constitutional Draft Group will hold a general assembly, which will be the final meeting before adjournment. However, it is difficult to say for certain whether the discussions can be concluded in three days.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 24th] The Political Consultative Conference's sub-committees on the constitutional draft, government organization, and administrative programs held meetings in the morning and afternoon of the 24th. Further progress was made in reaching agreements on various issues. The sub-committees will continue negotiations tomorrow and convene the second meeting of the Comprehensive Committee without holding a general assembly.</p>
<p>[United Press, Chongqing, 24th] U.S. Special Envoy General Marshall held another meeting with Chairman Chiang this morning. It is expected that General Marshall will soon meet with the Military Group Committee to study the reorganization and nationalization of the Chinese army.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 24th] Special Envoy Marshall received Chairman Zhang Qun at his residence at 10:00 AM this morning.</p>
<h3>Ceasefire in Tai'an and Datong; Negotiations Underway in Jining and Chifeng</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 24th, Urgent Telegram] Military News: A ceasefire has been confirmed in Tai'an. Colonel Lake of the Military Mediation Department's Executive Group, along with Geng Xuwu, a staff officer of the Military Affairs Department, and Chen Shuliang, a CCP representative, jointly presented a ceasefire order from the government and the Communist army. The National Army has fully accepted it. Although the Communist army has agreed to the order to withdraw from Tai'an Station, they have not yet done so. Colonel Lake and others are still in Jinan, awaiting news of the Communist army's withdrawal from Tai'an. Whether the mediation work can proceed smoothly and whether the Jinpu Railway can be quickly repaired and open to traffic next month will depend on the Tai'an incident as a touchstone.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] London, 24th, Broadcast: A British Broadcasting Corporation correspondent who went to Suiyuan Province to inspect the implementation of the ceasefire order the day before yesterday felt optimistic about the future. The correspondent spoke with the commander of the Communist army, who said that the Chinese civil war has been going on for 35 years and that the Communist Party is eager to end this war as soon as possible.</p>
<p>[United Press, Peiping, 24th] The Executive Headquarters of the Military Mediation Department announced today that mobile investigation teams have made significant achievements in mediating conflicts between the Nationalists and the Communists in three locations, and negotiations are underway in several other locations. Details are as follows: (1) A team that flew directly from Chongqing to Luoshan in southern Henan reported that the commanders of the Nationalist and Communist armies in the area had reached a compromise and ordered their troops to cease fire immediately. (2) A team sent to Datong reported that hostilities had ceased within a radius of 221 li. Although there were reports that the Communist army had surrounded Datong, the report did not mention this. (3) A team sent to Xuzhou reported that conflicts near Xuzhou had decreased, and both sides had paid attention to the many incidents at the junctions of the Jinpu and Longhai lines. (4) Negotiations in Jining are still ongoing. The Communist Party claims to have occupied the area before the ceasefire order took effect, while the Nationalist army claims to have abandoned it after being occupied. (5) Negotiations are also underway in Chifeng. After the Soviet army withdrew from the area, the security team maintained order. The Soviet army's withdrawal from Chifeng was expected to be completed yesterday. There was no movement of Soviet troops in Duolun. The Fifth Mobile Investigation Team, based in Zhangjiakou, needs to travel by horse for 20 days to reach Duolun.

<h3>Command Post Established in Shenyang; Division Commander Liu Dechuan Appointed Garrison Commander; Defense of Jinxi Area Taken Over by Our Army</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Peiping, 23rd] The development of the situation in the Northeast has reached an important stage in the coming week. The date for the Soviet army to withdraw from the Northeast is the first of next month, and so far there has been no proposal from the National Government to request the Soviet army to postpone its withdrawal. According to news obtained here, the Soviet army has stated that the current fuel shortage in the Northeast has greatly affected its plan to use trains to transport troops. Therefore, the Soviet army in Shenyang and other places has not yet taken over defense. The Soviet side previously notified our authorities in Changchun that the Soviet army would withdraw from the Chengde, Chifeng, and Zhangjiakou lines on the 20th of this month, but as of now, the Soviet army in the area does not seem to have received withdrawal orders. The Nationalist army in Rehe has received notice from the Soviet army not to cross the Jianchang line, and the Nationalist army in the province has prepared to move in after the Soviet army withdraws. As for the handover of defense in Changchun, due to Madam Chiang's visit to Changchun, the Soviet army is still responsible for security.

<h3>UN General Assembly Passes Resolution to Establish Atomic Energy Commission Bernes Calls for Cooperation to Ensure Safety Vyshinsky Expresses Satisfaction with the Resolution in His Speech</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 24th] At today's meeting of the United Nations General Assembly, the 47 countries present unanimously agreed to organize a commission to "internationalize" the secrets of atomic energy. At the beginning of this morning's plenary session, the chief representatives of the "Big Three," US Secretary of State Bernes, British Foreign Secretary Bevin, and Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Vyshinsky, attended the plenary session for the first time. Bernes, who will return to Washington tomorrow, gave a farewell speech at today's meeting on the resolution on atomic energy, calling for international cooperation to maintain peace. At the same time, the Security Council is expected to hold its first public meeting this afternoon, so it is generally believed that today is one of the most important days since the birth of the United Nations. Today's gathering was the first plenary session since last Saturday. At the beginning, the representative of Ecuador and member of the Political and Security Committee, Lai Du, gave a brief speech, recalling the intention of establishing the Atomic Energy Commission, saying that the commission will inquire into all aspects of this issue, submit reports and recommendations to the Security Council, and exchange basic scientific information on atomic weapons among countries for peaceful purposes, ensure control over atomic energy, eliminate the use of atomic weapons for national armaments, and provide effective guarantees through inspection methods. Bernes took the stage and spoke in front of the microphone, warning that the arms race would be extremely dangerous in the atomic age if not controlled. The representatives warmly applauded and leaned forward to listen quietly. Vyshinsky followed Bernes to the stage for the first time and gave a brief speech in Russian. The whole audience cheered, and the representatives clearly felt that Vyshinsky expressed satisfaction with the resolution of the Atomic Energy Commission, which was very helpful in the debate. After representatives from Poland, Philippines, France, Brazil, and other countries spoke successively, the resolution to establish the Atomic Energy Commission was voted on by a show of hands. After a short pause, the President of the General Assembly, Spaak, announced in French that it had been unanimously passed, and the audience applauded continuously. The General Assembly then unanimously adopted the report of the Administrative and Budgetary Committee on the appointment of the Secretary-General and adjourned the meeting.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 24th] The Political and Security Committee unanimously approved its first report to the United Nations General Assembly last night, proposing that the General Assembly pass a resolution to establish a commission to deal with various issues arising from the discovery of atomic energy and related matters.</p>
<h3>Social and Economic Council Established Indian Representative Elected Chairman</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 24th] The head of the Indian delegation, Sir Mudaliar, has been elected Chairman of the Economic and Social Council. It is generally believed that the council is the most important organ of the United Nations. The council has 18 members and its task is to create economic conditions in the world that can eliminate the causes of war and will become the United Nations' defender of human rights and fundamental freedoms. Last night, the council held its first formal meeting in the Grand Hall of Westminster Abbey. After the representative of Colombia, Restrepo, suggested that Sir Mudaliar be elected as chairman, he himself and the representative of Yugoslavia, Stampar, were elected as vice-chairmen by nomination. The representatives warmly applauded Mudaliar as he delivered his chairman's speech in a steady tone. He said briefly: "I am extremely honored to be elected this time, but the responsibility is even greater. All representatives understand the birth of this council and its responsibilities, which are closely related to the true security and future of the world. This task is not easy, and we must continue to work hard in the future. I am determined to do my best in my capacity as chairman to promote the goals of this council, and I believe that all of you will do your best to achieve this goal. I am grateful for your election."</p>
<p>[United Press, London, 23rd] The American Federation of Labor, which has more than six million members in the United States and Canada, wrote to United Nations Secretary-General Huashi today, stating that if the World Federation of Trade Unions is allowed to participate in the Economic and Social Council, then the American Federation of Labor should also enjoy the same treatment. Walter, the international representative of the American trade union group, arrived in London last week. It is said that the World Federation of Trade Unions' request to participate in the United Nations is tantamount to a scattered group hoping to obtain a status equal to that of an independent country. It is reported that the World Federation of Trade Unions has temporarily withdrawn its request, but will still file its request with the Secretariat of the United Nations.</p>
<h3>US Representative Suggests Amending Trusteeship System So that Indigenous Peoples of Colonies Can Enjoy the Benefits of the Charter Koo Vi-kyuin Expresses Agreement</h3>
<p>[United Press, London, 24th] According to Dulles, a representative of the US delegation to the United Nations, the United States will suggest to the United Nations that the draft resolution on trusteeship be amended so that colonial countries allow their governed people to enjoy the benefits of the United Nations Charter in order to realize the "legitimate aspirations of non-self-governing peoples." A copy of the amendment has been sent to members of the committee. The proposal advocates that colonial countries should enable all indigenous peoples to generally enjoy the benefits of the United Nations Charter, rather than just the peoples of mandated territories. Comparing these two major categories of non-self-governing peoples, the residents of mandated territories total 13 million people, while the colonial peoples total more than 300 million. It is alleged that most of the non-trusteeship areas are in a state of extreme turmoil and unrest, and it would be a mistake to only think of the peoples of trusteeship territories and ignore the colonial peoples.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper] London, 25th broadcast: The Trusteeship Committee held a meeting last night, where the US representative suggested amending the Trusteeship System, and the Chinese representative Dr. Koo Vi-kyuin agreed. Dr. Koo said that all the world's nations obtaining autonomous governments is one of the conditions for lasting peace, and we are well aware of the current level of unrest among the governed peoples.</p>
<h3>French Mandated Territories in Africa Willing to Transfer to Trusteeship Only After Concluding Agreements with the Two Territories</h3>
<p>[United Press, London, 23rd] The former German territories of Togo and Cameroon in Africa were mandated to France by the League of Nations after World War I. Today, the French representative Ponsot announced in the United Nations General Assembly's Trusteeship Committee that France is willing to respect the text and spirit of the San Francisco United Nations Charter. After concluding agreements with Togo and Cameroon, the two territories will be transferred to the administration of the United Nations. However, due to the unstable political situation in France, no further announcements can be made. After Mr. Ponsot finished speaking, the representatives of various countries applauded. However, the US representative declared to the Trusteeship Committee that an agreement must be concluded with the mandated territory before the Trusteeship Council is established, causing the Council to be unable to be organized and established in the first phase of the General Assembly. The committee should announce its regret. The US representative hinted that the Trusteeship Council should be formed during the second phase of the meeting, which will be convened in the United States later.</p>
<p>[United Press, London, 24th] Prime Minister Attlee declared in the House of Commons today that the British government has notified China, the Soviet Union, the United States, and other countries about the draft on the transfer of African mandated territories by the United Kingdom to the United Nations. In addition, the King of Outer Jordan will come to London to discuss the issue of the country's independence.</p>
<h3>Representatives of the Five Powers Discuss Candidates for Secretary-General Unable to Reach a Decision Security Council to Continue Meeting Today</h3>
<p>[United Press, London, 24th] The United Nations Security Council is scheduled to hold a public meeting tomorrow afternoon to discuss how to deal with the situations in Iran, Greece, and Indonesia.</p>
<p>[United Press, London, 24th] The representatives of the five permanent members of the Security Council, namely US Secretary of State Bernes, Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Vyshinsky, British Foreign Secretary Bevin, French Representative Peng Gu, and Chinese Ambassador to the United Kingdom Koo Vi-kyuin, held an informal meeting yesterday to discuss the candidates for Secretary-General, but were still unable to reach a decision. The Soviet Union insists that since the headquarters of the United Nations are located in the Americas, the post of Secretary-General should belong to an Eastern European country, which is the reason for the difficulty in selecting a candidate.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 24th] The number of candidates for the post of Secretary-General has been reduced to two: one is the Canadian Ambassador to the United States, Pearson, who has the support of Britain and the United States, and the other is the Norwegian Foreign Minister, Lie, who has the support of the Soviet Union.</p>
<h3>Zhang Pengchun's Speech on the Opening Day of the Social and Economic Council Cites Mencius' Famous Quote The Whole Audience Applauds</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 23rd Dispatch] At the opening ceremony of the Economic and Social Council tonight, our representative Zhang Pengchun delivered a speech, mentioning two reasons why China is satisfied with the establishment of this important council: (1) The United Nations, as a living organization, must win and cultivate new confidence from the people in all corners of the world. I hope that this new confidence can be promoted through various constructive cooperative matters initiated by the Economic and Social Council. (2) People of all countries in the world want to obtain true mutual understanding and rely on each other's cooperation to solve some common problems. Appropriate viewpoints and careful review can help us promote various efforts to improve welfare. The ancient sage Mencius said, "Those who subdue others by force do not win their hearts; those who subdue others by virtue win their hearts with joy and sincerity." Zhang cited Mencius' famous quote in Chinese, which won applause from the whole audience. Zhang then said that Mencius' so-called "subduing people with virtue" is the responsibility of this council. If it can fulfill this responsibility, the whole world will "rejoice and sincerely submit."</p>
<h3>Gouin Elected President of France Starts Forming New Cabinet Encourages All Parties to Unite and Overcome Difficulties Together De Gaulle Expresses No Intention to Go Abroad</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] According to London, 24th broadcast: The French Constituent Assembly elected its successor president last night, and Socialist Party leader Gouin was elected with 497 votes. Gouin immediately announced that he hoped to form a new cabinet tomorrow, including several ministers and several deputy ministers. According to his remarks to reporters, the new French government has an unprecedented responsibility. I did not seek the post of president this time, and I accepted the new post because of a sense of responsibility. If necessary, I am prepared to sacrifice my life for the country. I deeply hope that all party members will unite and overcome the current difficult period.</p>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 23rd] The Socialist Party leader, 61-year-old lawyer Gouin, has been elected as the interim prime minister to succeed the popular Comnole. According to the current situation, it can be predicted that his task will not be easy to complete. According to official sources, De Gaulle resigned in anger because the three major French parties failed to abandon their private opinions during the national construction period. The Communist Party initially nominated Thorez as a candidate, but because the People's Republican Movement opposed it, it changed to nominating Gouin in a non-partisan action. After Gouin takes office, the Communist and Socialist parties will unite in the main task of the parliament to formulate the constitution of the Fourth French Republic to confront the People's Republican Movement. According to the two parties, they want the parliament to have full power, and make the head of the executive branch a mere formality. The People's Republican Movement advocates the establishment of upper and lower houses, and the president must also have power. Today, the party and the Communist Party had disputes over the announcement of the program, which made the future participation in the new government rather gloomy.</p>
<p>[French News Agency, Paris, 23rd] According to information available from all parties, General de Gaulle will stay for a few days in his Marie Le Roy residence, and is expected to leave for the Sept Fontaines castle in the Ardennes province. He has never expressed any intention of going abroad. He now spends part of his time reading books and taking walks. Except for a few colleagues in his former cabinet, he does not receive any other visitors.</p>
<h3>Gouin's Brief Biography</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Compilation Room] The new French President Gouin was born in Bayonne in 1884. Both his parents were teachers. At the age of twenty, Gouin studied law and joined the Socialist Party. In May 1911, he was appointed as a member of the Aix-en-Provence Provincial Assembly. In 1914, World War I broke out, and Gouin joined the army. After the end of the European War, he was appointed as a member of the Civil and Criminal Law Committee of the Parliament and also served as a member of the Finance Committee. After the German-French truce in July 1940, Gouin voted against Pétain. The French Socialist Party maintained close contact with the resistance forces, and Gouin made great contributions. In early 1942, Gouin left France and was detained in Spain, but arrived in London in August of the same year. In 1943, he went to Algiers and was elected as the vice chairman of the Provisional Advisory Committee. Gouin returned to France in August 1944. Although Gouin is from southern France, he has no radical temperament.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 24th] The new French Head of Government Gouin told reporters last night that he intended to ask Bidault to remain as Foreign Minister so that he could return to London as soon as possible and continue his work at the United Nations General Assembly.</p>

<h3>Local Correspondences</h3>
<p>Jinshan: Establishing Information Offices to Disrupt the Locality</p>
<p>Recently, a person in this county claiming to be the head of a Military Intelligence Bureau agency, Ni Sheng-san, who is the alias of Ni Jian-ping, the former puppet district chief of Lüxiang in Mao Port. He collected military rice to aid the enemy during the enemy-puppet era. Now, he has transformed himself, claiming to be an intelligence officer, and has arbitrarily established an information office, appointing dozens of people to spread throughout the county, defrauding the people. Many innocent civilians, such as Gu Hong-shu and Sun Yong-yu, have been victimized. In addition to infringing on their personal freedom, they have been extorted for millions of puppet currency. Fair-minded people in the locality, in view of the fact that Ni is still daring to disrupt the locality on this victorious and bright day, which is extremely unlawful, have jointly sent telegrams to the relevant authorities, requesting a swift and thorough investigation and strict handling.</p>
<p>Changshu: Provincial Government Sends Personnel to Investigate Tax Grain</p>
<p>Wang Kun-shan, the former puppet county magistrate, levied and stored 2,000 dan of tax grain in the 33rd year of the Republic. The Vanguard Army Headquarters had previously reported this to the Provincial Government. After the county government was restored, this tax grain was never received. Because Wang Kun-shan has now fled, the Provincial Government, in addition to issuing a warrant for his arrest, has recently sent Commissioner Yu Jun-yuan to Changshu to thoroughly investigate the personnel involved, to determine whether there was any embezzlement, in order to uncover the truth.</p>
<p>Suzhou: Garrison Troops Given Deadline to Suppress Lake Bandits</p>
<p>Robberies in the Suzhou countryside have been frequently reported recently. The Suzhou-Hangzhou ferry was robbed by bandits at Jiapu Bridge the day before yesterday, and passengers were shot and injured. The firearms of the escorting soldiers were also seized. When the news arrived, the Fuxing Steamer, which also runs between Suzhou and Hangzhou, was also attacked yesterday on its way from Hangzhou to Suzhou when passing Jiapu Bridge. At night, gunshots suddenly rang out, and the escorting soldiers returned fire. For a while, both sides exchanged bullets like rain. The bandits were unprepared and fled towards Tai Lake. The body of a bandit was found killed on the shore. A passenger named Xu A-yue was injured by a stray bullet, and the ship itself was also damaged in several places. After opening to Suzhou, repairs were carried out immediately. Because the Suzhou-Hangzhou route was robbed twice in the same place within two days, merchants were wary. Therefore, the Suzhou-Hangzhou ferry suspended operations on the 23rd. They also requested the authorities to suppress the bandits. Upon hearing the report, Ma Zong-zhi, the Commander-in-Chief of the Loyalty and Rescue Army stationed in Suzhou, specially dispatched Ren Xian-ting, the commander of the Third Detachment, to rush to suppress the bandits, with a deadline to clear them out by the end of this month.</p>
<p>Liyang: Murderer of Martyr Executed by Firing Squad; Enemy Military Agent Ma Li-xing, who committed many evils during the Japanese occupation of Liyang. His most vicious act was the murder of Di Wei-cheng. It was found that Di was a graduate of the fifth class of the Whampoa Military Academy and had engaged in underground work and anti-Japanese activities. After Ma discovered this, he captured Di and put him in a hemp sack, strangled him to death, then cut his body into several pieces and buried him in the soil. He also forcibly occupied Di's wife. Di's wife had to temporarily endure the humiliation in order to avenge her husband. Today, when the sun has shone again, Li Huan-wei, the leader of the Liyang Group of the Jinghu Garrison Pacification Work Supervision Group, upon arriving in Liyang, Di's wife reported the injustice and denounced Ma, who was captured and interrogated. After the facts were confirmed, he was executed by firing squad on the 14th, to the great satisfaction of the people.</p>
<p>Wuhu: Suspension of Dismantling of Jing-Wu Railway Tracks</p>
<p>The dismantling of the railway tracks from Nanjing to Wuhu, originally scheduled for the 20th of this month to supplement the Jinpu Trunk Line, has been suspended because the weight of the railway tracks could not be matched. Normal traffic will continue. In addition, since the Wuhu Water and Electricity Plant was taken over by the Provincial Government and run as a public utility after the victory, the electricity rate is now 250 yuan per kilowatt-hour, which is more than four times higher than that of Nanjing and Shanghai. The burden on users is too heavy, and it is stimulating various commodity prices. There has been a unanimous demand for an immediate price reduction to reduce the burden on residents.</p>
<h3>U.S. Navy Tests Atomic Bomb Power; Location is North of the Marshall Islands; About One Hundred Various Ships Participate</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 24th] The United States Navy announced today the atomic bomb attack test plan. This experiment will fundamentally change naval operations. The test is scheduled to begin on May 1st, with 97 ships participating, from aircraft carriers to battleships to submarines and transport ships, all as giant targets. Each ship will be anchored on Bikini Island, north of the Marshall Islands, with the lagoon serving as the test site. Vice Admiral Buckeridge, Special Director of the Navy, released the following details: The attacked fleet will include four U.S. aircraft carriers, five submarines, and nineteen destroyers; the German cruiser "Prinz Eugen" and the Japanese battleship "Nagato" and a light cruiser. This is not a joint or international action, but a scientific experiment conducted solely by the United States government. Each target, whether destroyed or damaged, will be arranged in different ways. The first test is scheduled to take place in early May, with an atomic bomb detonating hundreds of feet above the fleet. The second test is tentatively scheduled for July, with an atomic bomb detonating on the surface of the water. Afterwards, about fifty deep-water tests will be conducted in the high seas. Fifty U.S. Navy ships and 20,000 personnel will be deployed for this test and record the results. U.S. ships selected as targets include the cruisers Nevada, Saratoga, Independence, and Fall River; the battleships Arkansas, Pennsylvania, New York. The main objective of the test is to determine the impact of atomic bombs on naval vessels in order to obtain valuable information for national defense. The secondary objective is to train air force personnel in conducting atomic bomb attacks on ships in order to determine the effectiveness of atomic bombs on military facilities and equipment. The latest scientific techniques and equipment will be used during the experiment to observe, measure, and report the effects of the atomic bomb. Observers will include Congressional, Army, Navy, and scientific personnel, as well as journalists. The issue of inviting foreign representatives and foreign journalists is being considered jointly by the heads of the Army, Navy, and State Departments. As for the ships used for the test in the field, they will be naval vessels from the United States, Germany, and Japan, with the German heavy cruiser Prinz Eugen being the main target of the atomic bomb. The ship was damaged by bombing by the United Nations Air Force but did not sink. It arrived in Boston this Wednesday. The Japanese main battleship Nagato, undefended in Tokyo Bay, but still intact, will also be used as a major target. The former flagship of the U.S. Pacific Fleet, the Pennsylvania, which was attacked in Pearl Harbor and repaired for months before rejoining the fleet, and the Nevada, which was also damaged in Pearl Harbor, will both be used as test subjects after repairs. In addition, several destroyers and submarines will be added. The experiment will begin around May 1st and will continue until the technical experts have collected all the materials, hopefully ending by July 4th.</p>

<h3>Please Listen to the People's Voices: Speak More Justly: Sixteen Provinces' Compatriots Hold Tea Party to Appeal to Representatives of the Political Consultative Conference: Airmail Report from This Newspaper on the 18th, Sent by Zhao Hao-sheng from the War-time Capital</h3>
<p>For the past nine days, I, as a reporter, have often heard many representatives in the Political Consultative Conference loudly proclaiming "The People!" "The People!" In order to explain their opinions, they often use "the meaning of the people" and "for the people" as the basis for their arguments in their speeches. "The People" is such a glorious word, and "the voice of the people" is so loud! However, where is the real voice of the people? What do the people hope for and demand?</p>
<p>On the evening of the 18th, on the day the eighth session of the Political Consultative Conference—the discussion on the National Assembly issue—ended, in the auditorium of the Victory Building in the war-time capital, the fellow-provincials associations in Chongqing of Liaoning, Jilin, Heilongjiang, Chahar, Suiyuan, Jehol, Jiangsu, Anhui, Guangdong, Henan, Hebei, Shandong, Shanxi, Shaanxi, Beiping, and Tianjin, sixteen provinces and cities, held a tea party to entertain the representatives of the Political Consultative Conference in order to express their hopes and ask them to listen to the real voice of the people.</p>
<p>Because it represents the prayers and aspirations in the hearts of millions of people, the atmosphere of this tea party made people feel particularly solemn and heavy.</p>
<p>Mr. Pei Ming-yu was the first to stand up and speak on behalf of the repatriation promotion associations of various fellow-provincial associations. The repatriation promotion association is the organization that coordinates the repatriation of millions of compatriots who are eager to return to their hometowns from the rear area. However,</p>
<p>Looking east at the distant homeland, the road is long and arduous. Until now, everyone is still at a loss. Mr. Pei said with a sigh in his voice that since the victory, none of the compatriots who had been wandering in the rear area did not hope to return to their hometowns and reunite with their families as soon as possible. However, today there are still many unlawful troops carrying out acts of oppression and trampling on the people. If the representatives truly think of the common people, they should first quickly disarm these unlawful troops that harm the people. Under the principle of nationalization of the army, incorporate them into the National Army system, because in a state of unified military orders, even if there are acts of disturbing the people, the common people can still have a channel to report their grievances, otherwise the people will</p>
<p>never have peaceful days. In addition, he hoped for unified administrative orders. He said: "Any faction that wants to split the government is a public enemy of the people. Our common people must resist." Finally, he said earnestly, word by word, "The representatives should respect the interests of the people more and think less about the private interests of the party. Only in this way can they be true representatives of the people."</p>
<p>Mr. Xiang Ju-tan said in his speech that he recently received a letter from Jiangsu, knowing that</p>
<p>the elders in his hometown, who had endured eight years of suffering, are still in dire straits today. Today, he wants to appeal to the representatives of the Political Consultative Conference on behalf of these suffering people, especially to his old friend Mr. Liang Shuming, and express a hope that Mr. Liang can use the spirit of running rural education to speak more justly and compassionately in the conference hall. He hoped that the representatives would pay attention to maintaining the existing laws and disciplines of the country and not destroy unity or shake the foundations of the nation.</p>
<p>Mr. Liang Shuming stood up to speak. Just like the other representatives of the Democratic League said in the Political Consultative Conference, he also said that the Democratic League is not a political party. He said that he would not participate in politics and would continue to do cultural work. In order to respond to Mr. Xiang's expectations, he emphasized: "I believe my actions will certainly live up to the expectations of all the friends present." Mr. Liang spoke in this venue</p>
<p>in front of the representatives of sixteen provinces, and his attitude seemed much more cautious than in the general assembly.</p>
<p>Mr. Ma Cun-kun, the representative of Anhui, brought up the "Draft Program for Peaceful National Reconstruction" published by the Chinese Communist Party. He said that this proposal to form a separatist regime: "We, the people, do not agree!"</p>
<p>Mr. Duan Yong-qing spoke on behalf of the elders of Hebei Province. He also said: The people will despise those who do not obey the government's policy of peaceful unification!</p>
<p>Mr. Chen Qitian, representing the Youth Party, explained their proposals of "nationalization of the army" and "democratization of politics" put forward in the Political Consultative Conference, and believed that this time, through consultation, a satisfactory effect could be achieved. Mr. Qi Yan-ming, the representative of the Chinese Communist Party, also believed that</p>
<p>the day for the people to return to their hometowns should be coming soon. Mr. Chen Lifu, the representative of the government, spoke for the first time at the Political Consultative Conference that day. Here, he still explained with the same sincerity as in the general assembly that the most important thing at present is to quickly restore transportation and start peaceful reconstruction work. He said: China is now</p>
<p>moving from a one-party political system to a multi-party political system. Under a multi-party political system, if political parties have armies, the country will never have peace.</p>
<p>The tea party ended at ten o'clock. On this night of power outage in Chongqing, the moonlight was like water. I looked up at the round and bright moon and suddenly realized that it was only half a month away from the Lunar New Year. The family reunion that had been longed for for eight years should be realized, right? "While the sun shines, we must sing aloud and indulge in wine, and we should return to our hometowns with our friends!" This joyful dream, like a poem, should be enjoyed by the people who have been wandering in suffering for eight years?</p>
<h3>The New Exchange Rate and the National Goods Movement</h3>
<p>The new exchange rate, which is attracting attention from all parties, will be announced soon. There are various rumors on the market. Some speculate that the U.S. exchange rate will be between 1,500 and 2,000, while others advocate adopting a free exchange rate in the short term.</p>
<p>Premise</p>
<p>We all place great expectations on this new exchange rate, which is related to the future destiny of the country. There is no other reason, that is, we hope that the people of the country will work hard to develop export trade, obtain a large amount of foreign exchange, and exchange it for a large number of production machines, so as to achieve self-sufficiency in major goods and no longer rely on other countries. Therefore, the re-establishment of the exchange rate should be based on encouraging exports and absolutely preventing the import of large quantities of consumer goods.</p>
<p>Reviewing our country's export trade, before the war, it was mainly raw materials. The light industrial products of the Japanese in the past, such as cotton textiles, etc., occupied vast markets overseas in the South Sea Islands, Africa, and South America. After the defeat of Japan, we can take advantage of this opportunity, make efforts to produce in the enemy-puppet factories that have been taken over, and replace Japan's pre-war position. After our country's victory and in the early stage of recovery, the trade deficit is inevitable. We sincerely hope that the government can find ways to balance it. At the same time, on the people's side, we should practice frugality, reduce or eliminate secondary consumption, and absolutely save all imported goods, so as to preserve valuable foreign exchange. At the same time, we still need to put forward an old slogan: Promote National Goods.</p>
<p>National Goods</p>
<p>Although the phrase "Promote National Goods" has become a buzzword for the past twenty years, please ask yourselves, fellow compatriots, have you earnestly followed these four words? Especially in the current post-victory society, the trend of extravagance has increased. Social figures take pride in enjoying imported goods. We must know that the economic and industrial prosperity of a country is built on the consumption of the vast majority of the people. Therefore, promoting national goods, in a positive sense, should awaken industrial manufacturers to strive for technological improvement. In a negative sense, we should cultivate the people's psychology of loving and using national goods. Regarding "Promoting National Goods," how should we promote it? Now let's briefly describe it in several aspects:</p>
<p>Society</p>
<p>Our country's social organization is complex and unsystematic. In the future, after order is roughly established, local autonomy institutions will be established? We can use the Baojia system to promote the atmosphere of promoting national goods in society.</p>
<p>Manufacturers</p>
<p>In the few months after the victory, the factories in the rear area collapsed, shut down, or requested government relief. In Shanghai, all domestic products are being overwhelmed by cheap goods from overseas. Importers are busy soliciting orders. If our country's manufacturers do not strive to improve themselves in this environment, I am afraid they will be eliminated by the times. Regarding product quality, they should strive for improvement so as not to create opportunities for foreign goods to invade. The selling price of finished products should be as low as possible, so that the people will naturally be happy to use national goods.</p>
<p>In this way, the "Three No's" of Henry Ford's automobile manufacturing plant in the United States can give our manufacturers a model: (1) Do not use cheap workers (increase salaries appropriately to stabilize workers' lives), (2) Do not work beyond eight hours (strive to reduce working hours to improve work efficiency), (3) Do not exceed the selling price of equivalent goods (low selling price, excellent products). This point depends on the joint efforts of manufacturers and laborers.</p>
<p>Government</p>
<p>It is necessary to coordinate a good plan, urge the local government that is close to the people, lead the masses, and promote the promotion of national goods. We must know that this movement can lay the foundation for national prosperity. Civil servants should set an example in terms of daily clothing, and try their best to use national goods as a guide for the masses.</p>
<p>The thirty-fourth year of the Republic has passed. The earth has returned to spring, and everything has begun. We sincerely hope that our government will give deep consideration to the re-establishment of the new exchange rate, and we hope that the people of the whole country will work together with one heart and mind to actively promote the "Promote National Goods" movement.

<h3>The Specific Propositions of Overseas Chinese Regarding National Policy</h3>
<p>Government and military orders must be unified, and National Assembly representatives can only be supplemented.</p>
<p>The foundation of the nation cannot be shaken, and the fruits of victory cannot be discarded.</p>
<p>To the Editor: The various overseas Chinese organizations in the wartime capital held a meeting on the Political Consultative Conference and sent a letter to all members and compatriots across the country, hoping to have it published in your esteemed newspaper to express public opinion.</p>
<p>The Political Consultative Conference includes thirty-eight social elites, representatives from various parties and factions. We overseas Chinese, numbering in the tens of millions, were not granted a seat to participate in the discussions, which we deeply regret. However, if the participating gentlemen can truly uphold the principles of mutual love and sincerity, seek a good path towards national unity and solidarity, and lead the country to prosperity and strength, then our wishes will be fulfilled, and we will not insist on fighting for representation or forcefully making demands. The current conference has been underway for a week, and speeches fill the halls. Where is the path to unity? The ceasefire order has been issued, but local conflicts are still raging. Considering the future of our nation, we feel a bitter taste in our mouths and must speak out!</p>
<p>Overseas Chinese reside in foreign lands, living under the roof of others. Our intentions are very simple: the unity and strength of our motherland. To achieve this goal, for the past fifty years, we have assisted the Father of the Nation in overthrowing the Manchu Qing dynasty and completing the national revolution. We have supported the Kuomintang in eliminating warlords and completing the national unification movement. We have also supported the government in persevering in the War of Resistance and completing the national liberation movement. We have contributed money and effort, sparing no sacrifice. This heart and this will have remained unchanged over time. Now that victory has arrived and the nation is beginning to be built, the situation of unity is suddenly cast into the shadow of division and separatism, and the ranks of solidarity are marred by the bad news of military conflicts. Who is creating civil war? Who is encouraging civil war? From the standpoint of the people, we have long seen it clearly. We hope that the propagandists of various parties and factions will no longer wag their tongues, constantly invoking "the people" and "the masses," even mentioning how overseas Chinese are somehow representative, because it is not enough to represent the genuine people. We have long discerned where the crux of unity and solidarity lies. However, today's problem is not about discussing rights and wrongs or merits and demerits, but how to ensure unity and solidarity. Only when unity is successful and solidarity is realized can we talk about peaceful nation-building. Otherwise, the haze of peace will be difficult to clear away forever, and the obstacles to nation-building cannot be removed. In the past week, what efforts have the esteemed gentlemen made to promote unity? What contributions have they made to consolidate solidarity? The plans of various parties seem to be far apart and difficult to compromise. We now wish to state the observations of overseas Chinese on the issue of unity and solidarity, and we wish to solemnly reaffirm the strong desire of overseas Chinese for the unity and strength of the motherland. Please discuss them separately as follows:</p>
<p>First, the issue of unity. What is unity? It means the complete exercise of administrative power by the government. If the participating gentlemen have the sincerity to promote unity, they should find ways to bring the independent governments under the central government and reorganize the autonomous armies into the national army, in order to achieve the unity of government and military orders. Because today's National Government is not only recognized by all countries in the world, but also jointly recognized by all parties and factions as the unshakable foundation for a unified country. However, how to reorganize the governments of the "Border Regions" and "Liberated Areas," how to reorganize the Communist armies and all miscellaneous troops, is the specific step towards unifying government and military orders. Regarding the latter, the Military Tripartite Group has already been jointly deliberating. Regarding the former, why have the representatives of various parties neglected to discuss it and focused on the reorganization of the National Government's structure? This is truly incomprehensible. The government previously indicated that it would open up political power and recruit talents from all sides, and even proposed implementing universal suffrage at the county level. It is heard that Mr. Liang Shuming, a member of the Democratic League, advocated specializing the three provinces of Rehe, Chahar, and Hebei, with parties sending members to form the government, and even argued that Sichuan, Yunnan, Guizhou, and Xikang could do the same. If feasible, how many talents from the Village Governance Faction are capable of serving as high officials of the entire province? Mr. Zhang Dongsun even strongly pointed out that the national army is a party army, speaking up for the Chinese Communist Party. If what he says is true, then the millions of officers and soldiers who died in the War of Resistance will not rest in peace! If Mr. Zhang had not been trapped in Beiping during the War of Resistance but had been in the rear, he would have opposed the full-scale War of Resistance led by the Kuomintang and advocated evading military service to avoid being used by the Kuomintang. All such irresponsible remarks are by no means a good manifestation of democratic politics and may hinder the harmony of the atmosphere inside and outside the conference. We oppose this kind of extraneous fallacy and firmly advocate the unification of government and military orders under the central government.</p>
<p>Second, the issue of solidarity. It is undeniable that solidarity is based on democracy. However, democracy requires long-term effort and cannot be achieved overnight. The progress of the British civil rights movement has taken thousands of years to reach the current scale of constitutional monarchy. Although the United States was founded later, its people came from the Old World and have an innate understanding of exercising civil rights. China has only been established for thirty-four years, plagued by internal and external troubles and has never had a peaceful day. The Kuomintang has been in power for only twenty years, suppressing internal rebellion and leading the War of Resistance. In this turmoil, political tutelage is difficult to succeed. It is impossible to achieve success overnight and be able to compete with advanced countries like Britain and the United States. The Chinese Communist Party often boasts of the "people's democratic" councils in the border areas and liberated areas, but whether they are monopolized by one party and how much democratic composition they have is not difficult to judge fairly with common sense. If various parties and factions insist on not yielding and compete for the re-election of the National Assembly, it is meaningless. Moreover, there are currently more than 900 representatives in the National Assembly. Whether today's so-called various parties and factions possess the popular will represented by these more than 900 people is doubtful. We believe that national affairs are not child's play. Since the National Assembly representatives have been elected according to law and have not yet performed their duties, neither the government nor any party can unilaterally deny them with a single order. Otherwise, the National Assembly representatives can rise up to fight for the protection of civil rights, and the broad masses of the people will still be the backing of the National Assembly representatives to seek the promotion of human rights, then China's political disputes will never be resolved. We hope that the government can make more concessions and hold supplementary elections with more quotas. If various parties and factions must insist on re-election, they must also carefully examine whether their parties have made great contributions to our country and have not committed crimes that harm the people in the process of the national revolution. The Kuomintang has the great achievements of overthrowing the Manchu Qing dynasty, establishing the Republic of China, suppressing internal rebellion, and leading the War of Resistance. Moreover, its Three Principles of the People's nation-building strategy is the highest guiding principle for nation-building accepted by the people of the whole country and even various parties. The direction of people's hearts and the number of victories and defeats must be considered by various parties. We believe that in the transitional period before the National Assembly, the powers of the National Political Council should be expanded and its membership expanded to accommodate talents from all sides, making it a democratic parliament similar to the British and American models, so as to fulfill its function of uniting the strength of the whole country and supervising the government's administration.</p>
<p>Third, the aspirations of overseas Chinese for the motherland. For hundreds of years, overseas Chinese have been under the rule of colonial governments, and the spiritual pain they have suffered is beyond description. Especially when the Manchu Qing dynasty was weak and the country had fallen into a semi-colonial status, overseas Chinese were even worse than slaves and animals in the eyes of foreigners. Fortunately, the great revolutionary leader, Father of the Nation Sun Yat-sen, led the Kuomintang in carrying out the national revolution, and the future of the new China gradually dawned. Now, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek led the army in the Northern Expedition, completing unification, resisting foreign aggression, and leading the War of Resistance. Unexpectedly, with the arrival of victory, there are still bad phenomena of feudal separatism and wielding troops for self-aggrandizement. Those who are ignorant of the matter are even helping to fuel the specialization of local political power and the brewing of de facto independence, causing all the government's steps in restoration and nation-building to suffer endless obstacles. We firmly support the Three Principles of the People and oppose undermining the unity of the nation and the people. The result of the bloody sacrifices of millions of revolutionary martyrs and fallen soldiers is the foundation of the nation today, the fruits of victory, which cannot be discarded by a few soulless ambitious people. We yearn for China's unity and strength, and we also hope that the government's administration will strive for progress. The biggest problem with today's government administration is the corruption of some officials and the abandonment of discipline and laws. We are keenly aware of the revolutionary struggle history of the Kuomintang and deeply know that the Kuomintang, in its position of being in power, bears the heavy responsibility of the country and must broadly recruit talents. However, it is inevitable that corrupt forces and political opportunists will take the opportunity to invade, causing the evils of bureaucracy, while most of the true Kuomintang members are hardworking, clean and self-respecting people, and their great contribution and hard work in the War of Resistance and nation-building cannot be erased by propaganda and attacks. We believe that only the Kuomintang has the great leadership force to complete the construction of a new China based on the Three Principles of the People. Here, we sincerely hope that the first major party with fifty years of glorious revolutionary history will strive for progress and shoulder its historical mission.</p>
<p>In summary, what I have said is not a profound theory. We believe that today's political consultation is necessary due to the intertwined and complex domestic and international situations, and it is also a last resort. After all, today, after winning the war, the country has entered the ranks of the four great powers, and there can be no more internal disturbances and self-harm. Especially during the eight years of the War of Resistance, the people in the occupied areas were in deep water and hot fire, eagerly hoping that the government would come to rescue them from hunger and thirst, like looking to the clouds during a severe drought. The government is taking all measures to save the people and recover lost territory, and the Chinese Communist Party cannot rely on liberation to share the surrender and come out to obstruct it. Even if it has any reason, it violates the principle of unified government and military orders and cannot be strongly defended by propaganda. The people cannot be deceived and are not ignorant of the truth. For twenty years, the compatriots in the country have suffered from war and are exhausted from running around! We sincerely hope that the Communist Party can cease fire and negotiate a truce, hand over the army to the country, and set a good example for democratic politics. We especially hope that other parties and factions other than the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, although not representatives of the people, must still make good arguments for the unity, prosperity, and happiness of the country and the welfare of the people. Do not think that the contradiction between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity and fully strive for the privacy of one party. It must be known that the mission of political consultation is to seek national unity and solidarity, not a venue for various parties to compete for political power. We believe that the Kuomintang's proposition of returning power to the people, not to the party, is absolutely correct. Only the National Assembly, which represents the will of the people, can accept political power. Various parties and factions are by no means representatives of the people. Only those who have been elected by the people through elections can represent the people. If three people can form a party and five people can form a faction, all can influence politics and control political power, then our ten million overseas Chinese can organize ten million parties, and the compatriots of the whole country can organize tens of millions of parties. In this way, can it still be called a country? We must not set this bad precedent in the history of the new Chinese political system at the time when we are beginning to implement democratic constitutionalism. In the ongoing conference, some people are afraid to mention the word "spoils." I believe that you gentlemen do not need to be taboo. Are you here for the benefit of the country and the people, or are you here to compete for official positions and representation? Only facts can explain! The people are the most just judges. Everything in the conference is open. We are willing to hear your high opinions and wait and see what happens. May the gentlemen not forget the sincere wishes of the one million overseas Chinese for the unity and prosperity of the motherland! May the gentlemen not forget the sincere wishes of the 450 million compatriots in the country for the unity and prosperity of the country! The Nanyang Overseas Chinese Association, the Overseas Chinese Aspiring Association, the China Overseas Cultural Undertakings Promotion Association, the Overseas Chinese Returned to Chongqing Association, the Overseas Chinese Youth Service Undertakings Promotion Society, the Overseas Chinese Mutual Aid Society, the Overseas Chinese Youth Association, the Siamese Overseas Chinese Mutual Aid Society, the Netherlands East Indies Overseas Chinese Association, and the entire membership of the Burmese Overseas Chinese Rehabilitation Committee jointly proclaimed.

<h3>An Illustrated Explanation of the United Nations Structure, Its Organization, and Its Powers. See Details in the Following Description. Special Drawings by the Newspaper's Data Room</h3>
<p>The United Nations organization was established based on the World Charter passed by the San Francisco Conference on June 26, 1945. Countries that drafted and ratified the Charter officially became member states of the United Nations. In addition, other countries can also join with the recommendation of the Security Council and the approval of the General Assembly.</p>
<p>The member states that have already joined are China, the United States, the United Kingdom, the Soviet Union, the Commonwealth of Australia, Belgium, Canada, Costa Rica, Cuba, Czechoslovakia, the Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Greece, Guatemala, Haiti, Honduras, India, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Nicaragua, Norway, Panama, Poland, the Union of South Africa, Yugoslavia, France, Denmark, Mexico, the Philippines, Abyssinia, Iraq, Brazil, Bolivia, Iran, Iceland, Colombia, Liberia, Chile, Ecuador, Egypt, Paraguay, Peru, Uruguay, Venezuela, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Ukraine, Lebanon, Belarus, Argentina, and Syria, etc., totaling fifty-one countries.</p>
<p>The internal organization of the United Nations organization is very complex, so the average newspaper reader often does not understand it very well, or even has no clue. In order to help them increase their understanding, this newspaper specially uses an illustrative method to introduce in detail the basic knowledge about this large organization.</p>
<p>The above diagram shows the main organizational situation of the United Nations organization, showing its mutual relationships in its entire leadership system. The places drawn with dashed lines indicate relationships that have not yet been established.</p>
<p>(1) United Nations General Assembly: Each member state sends one representative to attend the General Assembly. It sets up three main institutions, and its task is to discuss any issues concerning world peace and submit recommendations to the Council.</p>
<p>(2) Security Council: There are eleven directors, including five permanent directors from the five powers, and the other six are elected by the General Assembly for a term of two years. Its task is to establish atomic energy control, investigate international disputes, and take action against aggressor countries when necessary.</p>
<p>(3) Economic and Social Council: There are eighteen directors, elected by the General Assembly, and their task is to help the member states eradicate the economic and social war-causing factors.</p>
<p>(4) International Court of Justice: There are fifteen judges, elected by the General Assembly. Any disputes between countries that can be judged are decided by the International Court of Justice.</p>
<p>(5) Trusteeship Council: The five powers are natural directors, and countries that manage colonies are also placed on the board of directors.</p>
<p>(6) Secretariat: There is one Secretary-General, and a number of researchers and clerks who are responsible for handling all the documents of the United Nations General Assembly and reporting to the General Assembly and the Security Council.</p>
<p>(7) International Bank for Reconstruction and Development: Part of the Bretton Woods monetary fund plan, approved by thirty-five countries, and responsible for providing construction funds.</p>
<p>(8) International Monetary Fund: Also part of the Bretton Woods plan, its purpose is to help member states stabilize their currency systems.</p>
<p>(9) United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization: This is a research organization that will be committed to improving the world's food and nutrition standards.</p>
<p>(10) International Civil Aviation Organization: Established in 1944, specializing in handling economic and legal issues related to commercial air transport.</p>
<p>(11) Atomic Energy Commission: Composed of the eleven directors of the Security Council and Canada, it studies the problems caused by the discovery of atomic energy.</p>
<p>(12) Military Staff Committee: Composed of the Chiefs of Staff of China, the United States, the United Kingdom, the Soviet Union, and France, it directs the troops to resist aggressor countries under the order of the Council.</p>
<p>(13) International Army: Composed of troops sent by the member states of the United Nations organization, to contain any threat to peace.</p>
<p>The Charter stipulates that three steps can be taken in resolving international disputes: The first step is discussion. Any country can appeal to the Security Council and request a public hearing of the report, even if the dispute involves one of the five powers, there is no exception. The second step is investigation and recommendations. Measures such as negotiation, mediation, or arbitration can be taken, or a local solution can be made, or the case can be handed over to the World Court for handling. The third step is action. According to the Charter, the Security Council can order the Military Staff Committee to use international force, first implementing demonstrations and blockades, and then carrying out other military actions.</p>
<p>World Oddities: Three-Wheeled Car</p>
<p>American automaker Calais Davis has made plans to manufacture three-wheeled cars and may begin manufacturing them in California within six months. This car weighs one thousand pounds and has several types of cylinders, such as four-cylinder, six-cylinder, and eight-cylinder. The four-cylinder type can travel forty miles per gallon of gasoline, the usual speed is 65 miles per hour, and the maximum speed is 80 miles per hour. (Translated from "Business Week").</p>
<p>Good News for the Blind</p>
<p>The U.S. Army Signal Corps is now working on creating a radar-like "observational eye." Once this work is completed, blind people will have the hope of seeing the light of day again. It is said that the auxiliary equipment of the "observational eye" is a luminous instrument, not radio waves. The auxiliary device weighs about nine pounds and is shaped like a square box. Its light forms a bright spot on any object, and the light spot immediately reflects the shape of the object being illuminated in the box. The "observational eye" can see from a distance of two feet to twenty feet. Therefore, with this instrument, blind people will be able to see everything again. (Translated from "The New York Times").</p>
<p>Colorful Facsimile</p>
<p>The inventor of the American color wireless facsimile instrument, Colmacbi, has also invented a radar wireless facsimile instrument. The facsimile rate of this facsimile machine is ten times faster than that of ordinary facsimile machines. After the radio station adopts the radar facsimile machine, its broadcast programs will be presented in color and in twice as much detail as before to the listening audience. (Translated from "The New York Times").</p>
<p>New Rat Poison</p>
<p>An American fish and seafood company has invented a rat poison called "1080," which is a very good rat poison in the United States. It is tasteless and extremely potent. However, because the average person is in danger of dying if they accidentally take one-fiftieth of an ounce of the drug, it is still not allowed to be used. The only manufacturer of "1080" announced that it would not sell it except to supply it to epidemic prevention personnel. (Translated from "Time").</p>
<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The Issue of Revising Import and Export Tariff Rates</h3>
<p>Current indications suggest that the government is actively utilizing tariff policies. For example: (1) Exempting items such as honey, black tea, brick tea, coarse and fine summer cloth, sorghum, and millet from taxation; (2) Planning to reduce import taxes on industrial production machinery while increasing tax rates on all luxury goods, with rumors that export tariffs will be revised to 7.5% ad valorem. Import tariffs on food, excluding foreign rice, will be set at 16.5% ad valorem; (3) Taxable prices for foreign goods will be uniformly based on the wholesale market price at the port of entry. While some of these measures may have already been implemented, and others are still under consideration, all represent the utilization of tariff policies to achieve protective or fiscal objectives. After enduring nearly a century of treaty tariffs and treaty-set customs values, we find these developments quite encouraging.</p>
<p>What remains unclear is whether the policy currently adopted is primarily protectionist or fiscal. Based on the aforementioned indications, it appears to be a combination of both. For instance, the 7.5% ad valorem export tariff, the exemption of certain export goods, the high tariffs on imported luxury goods, and the reduction in machinery tax rates all suggest this dual intention.</p>
<p>Given the current state of banknote issuance, the inflation of various temporary expenses, and the financial difficulties facing both the central and local governments, with customs duties remaining the most significant source of revenue, it would be more efficient to focus on moderately increasing tariffs rather than engaging in piecemeal efforts. This approach would save countless administrative and procedural hassles.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it is evident that the domestic industry is nascent, production is lagging, and domestically produced agricultural and industrial goods cannot compete with foreign goods without adequate protection. Therefore, the aforementioned two approaches, working in tandem, are difficult to criticize.</p>
<p>What we want to emphasize now is that whether for revenue or protection, proper implementation is crucial to avoid missing the original objectives. Regarding export goods, unless required for domestic production needs, they should generally be exempt from taxation. The imposition of a 7.5% tax is, of course, intended to generate revenue. However, if this tax on exports affects their sales, preventing them from competing with similar goods from other countries in the international market, then not only will the industry suffer, but the anticipated tax revenue will also fail to materialize. Therefore, we believe that this type of export tax should be appropriately adjusted based on market conditions. Whether it's light or heavy, it shouldn't solely rely on subjective standards or be completely uniform for the sake of procedural convenience. For example, the competitiveness of Taiwanese camphor and minerals such as antimony and tungsten from Hunan and Yunnan is relatively strong, so a slight increase in their tax rates wouldn't be significantly detrimental. As for raw silk, although our main competitor, Japanese silk, has declined, it is said that Shanghai can only export less than 20,000 bales, while Japan still has 300,000 bales in stock, not including the 100,000 bales already shipped to the United States after the war (enough for about three months of American consumption). Coupled with the remarkable development of American-produced artificial silk in recent years, it remains uncertain whether taxing Chinese silk will truly restore its sales.</p>
<p>As for the taxation of imported goods, there are various reasons. If it is truly for protection, then it must first be determined: (1) Do we have similar goods that need protection? (2) Is the tax rate high enough to provide protection? In other words, if we don't have similar products, there is no need for protection. If the tax rate is too low, foreign goods can still compete in China, thus failing to achieve the goal of protection. Although it may provide some fiscal relief, it will have lost its original purpose.</p>
<p>Therefore, we believe that the application of tariff policies is extremely complex. We believe that even in simple revenue-generating systems, the techniques are not simple, let alone when implementing protective policies, which naturally require particularly thorough investigation and preparation, and appropriate distinctions. The previous uniform 5% ad valorem method is certainly not applicable, and the new proposed 16.5% ad valorem rule still has room for further discussion.</p>

<h3>U.S. Military Tribunal First Trials Japanese War Criminals Prosecutor Indicts Two Major Charges Hearing Adjourned for Two Weeks</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The U.S. War Crimes Tribunal yesterday morning at 10:00 AM held its historic first trial of Japanese war criminals at Tilanqiao Prison.</p>
<p>Heavy Security Inside and Outside the Prison</p>
<p>The Ward Road Prison was heavily guarded, with American military police and Chinese security guards stationed at all four iron gates, conducting strict inspections. News reporters were also required to present special passes issued by the U.S. military to enter and exit. The elevator was operated by an American military police driver. The courtroom was located in the easternmost room on the fourth floor, with the judges facing the door, the Japanese war criminals' seats on the right, and a section for reporters on the left. In addition to the eighteen Japanese war criminals, five judges, two defense attorneys, two prosecutors, three Japanese interpreters, and one female clerk, there were more than thirty reporters and photographers from various newspapers and news agencies, as well as more than forty observers from Chinese and American authorities.</p>
<p>War Criminals Expressionless During Trial</p>
<p>Ten minutes before the trial began, the eighteen Japanese war criminals, escorted by American military police, entered the room in order and took their seats in three rows. They included Major General Masataka Kaburaki, Colonel Kameji Fukumoto, Major Sadatsugu Sakai, Captain Keisuke Kosaka, Brigadier General Tsutomu Fujii, Sergeant Major Shozo Masui, Sergeant Major Hisamatsu , Sergeant Major Kyukichi Yamaguchi, Sergeant Major Takayoshi Tsukada, Sergeant Major Yoshiyuki Takeuchi, Sergeant Major Junichi Fujii, Corporal First Class Private Yu Mizuta, Corporal First Class Private Yosaburo Shirakawa, Private First Class Shoji Nishikawa, Sergeant Major Koichi Matsuda, consular official of the Japanese consulate in Hankou Ryoichi Manabe, police officer of the consulate Shohei Hamada, and interpreter of the Model Youth Corps Takumi Kato. The last three, being non-military personnel, wore civilian clothes, while the rest were in military uniforms. The criminals appeared calm and expressionless, showing no signs of guilt. Several officers even raised their heads indifferently, as if no one else was present.</p>
<p>Lieutenant Colonel Weiss Reads the Charges</p>
<p>At exactly 10:00 AM, the chief presiding judge of the U.S. Military Tribunal, the commander of the U.S. Army Withdrawal Service Group, and the commander of the U.S. Military Supply Department, General Middleton, along with four associate judges, Colonel Spink, Colonel Auster, Colonel Cardue, and Lieutenant Colonel Mitchel, took their seats, and the trial began. First, the prosecutor, Lieutenant Colonel Weiss, announced that the case was against Japanese war criminals, that all eighteen war criminals were present, and that none of the four associate judges were absent, requesting the court to begin the trial. The court's female recorder and three Japanese interpreters stood and took their oaths. Lieutenant Colonel Weiss then announced the first document from General Wedemeyer, Commander-in-Chief of the U.S. Forces in China, asking the court to accept it. General Middleton declared the document accepted and asked if the defendants had any objections. The deputy defense attorney, Captain Lavell, accompanied by another assistant defense attorney, entered the room and said they had no objections. A Japanese officer representing the defendants also replied that there were no objections. The prosecutor then took his oath. General Middleton and the associate judges also took their oaths. All eighteen war criminals then stood at attention as Lieutenant Colonel Weiss read the two charges. The atmosphere in the courtroom was extremely solemn and tense. Lieutenant Colonel Jones read: "On or about December 16, 1944, these eighteen criminals (listed individually) violated wartime regulations and breached international law in Hankou by deliberately and unlawfully inflicting inhumane and cruel acts on certain American prisoners of war, whose true names are unknown. They paraded them through the streets of Hankou. Also, at the same time, these eighteen Japanese individuals did not hold a trial and subjected three American prisoners of war, whose true names are unknown, to beatings and torture, leading to the death of one."</p>
<p>Request for Adjournment for Retrial</p>
<p>The defense attorney then stated: "We have heard the charges." The chief judge then asked: "Do the defendants have any plea?" The defense attorney replied: "We have no specific plea at this time. We request an adjournment for retrial." He added: "The defendants request an additional two weeks to conduct a thorough investigation. The current defense attorney, Colonel Jenkins, has not yet arrived in Shanghai. The two of us are also newly appointed, so we must request a retrial in two weeks." The prosecutor stood and stated that he did not object to the adjournment. At this point, General Middleton decided to reconvene the trial at 9:00 AM on February 7.</p>
<p>Trial Questions and Answers Recorded and Broadcast</p>
<p>The defense attorney also reported that there were four other Japanese war criminals related to the prosecutor, but they were not included in today's proposal and will be tried separately later. At this time, it was exactly 10:30 AM. The judge first retired, and then the Japanese war criminals were escorted back in line, and the court adjourned.</p>
<p>After leaving the courtroom, reporters' and observers' credentials still had to be checked and returned to the U.S. military, to be retrieved again on February 6. Furthermore, all questions and answers in the courtroom yesterday were recorded by the U.S. military communications department and broadcast to the world yesterday afternoon.</p>
<h3>High Court Criminal Division Continues Trial of Traitors Yesterday Totaling Five Cases</h3>
<p>The High Court yesterday also tried five cases of traitors:</p>
<p>Lu Xiling, 42 years old, from Jiashan. In April of the 32nd year and May of the 33rd year, he served as chief detective for the enemy Gendarmerie twice, and he participated in the collection of rice in Yuhuizhen with the enemy army. He also extorted money in Jiashan Chamber of Commerce and arrested patriotic comrades. At half past nine yesterday morning, he was interrogated by Presiding Judge Liu Yugui. The prisoner denied all charges, showing a sneer and saying that it was not true. And said, "If the investigation is justified, it would be fine to shoot him." Then the witness Qian Yaozhen testified, "On July 25th last year, Lu Xiling sent someone to arrest me, forced a confession by torture and pouring cold water, detained me for two days and released me. After his release, Lu also wanted me to work for the enemy's intelligence work." In addition, the Jiashan County Government sent a member to Shanghai to request the High Court to bring the defendant back for trial. The court ruled that the traitor cases were all handled by this court, and there was no need to bring him back. The case was adjourned for a retrial, and the defendant was taken back into custody.</p>
<p>Ling Guangyan</p>
<p>The case was heard again yesterday. The High Court temporarily interrogated him because it had received important documents from all parties. The most powerful evidence was a commemorative photo of Ling's opening banquet at Dafa Company in Suzhou on April 27, 1938, which included Ling and the enemy appeasement team, the Japanese army, and dozens of Japanese men and women, as well as a poem, which is copied below: "The sound of songs in Wu, an enchanting Chen; Cherry plum blooming, surrounding as one family in spring." This case is scheduled to be heard again on the 26th.</p>
<p>Dong Jinfu</p>
<p>Thirty-five years old, from Tianjin. From October 22nd of the 33rd year, he joined the puppet army's 37th Division and served as a major secretary at the Shanghai Office. After the victory, he was arrested by the police station at No. 209 China Hotel, Guizhou Road, and transferred to the High Court Prosecutor's Office, which filed a public prosecution based on the Regulations on Punishing Traitors. At 11:00 AM, he was interrogated by Judge Zhu Zonghai. The prisoner confessed that on October 23rd of the 33rd year, he was introduced by Zhang Dingyi to take care of the household chores at the residence of Ding Shutang, the commander of the 37th Division of the puppet army, in the form of a servant, without knowing a single word, and did not serve as a secretary.</p>
<p>At 3:00 PM, the collegiate panel interrogated Han Shaolin, a third-class signalman in the puppet navy, and Zhang Jingen, a foreman and translator at the enemy field warehouse in Jiading. The prisoners all confessed and were scheduled to be sentenced at 2:00 PM on the 31st of this month.</p>
<h3>Traitor Xia Zhongming is Not Dead</h3>
<p>After the former puppet organization special agent, Xia Zhongming, was arrested and detained, he suffered from severe drug addiction. He once fainted from withdrawal, leading to widespread rumors that Xia had died. According to sources close to Xia's family yesterday, Xia's children often visit the detention center to bring food, so he has not died. It is also rumored that the High Court is preparing to try him.</p>
<h3>Army Headquarters Sends Personnel to Jointly Try Jiang Gongmei</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] After Jiang Gongmei, the former Shanghai Gendarmerie, was escorted from Chongqing to Shanghai, the Songhu Garrison Headquarters has been searching for evidence of crimes for days, and it has come to an end. Commander Qian, for the sake of prudence, sent a telegram to the Army Headquarters to send personnel for a joint trial. It is now known that a senior official from the headquarters arrived in Shanghai by plane a few days ago, and the case is expected to be tried in the military law office within days.</p>
<h3>Two Routes Temporarily Add Fourth-Class Cars</h3>
<p>The Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway authorities, due to the upcoming Lunar New Year and the large number of passengers, in order to alleviate congestion, have temporarily added fourth-class passenger cars to freight trains from yesterday and the day before yesterday until February 1st. The Beijing-Shanghai line added two trains yesterday, one leaving at 5:30 PM, stopping at Nanjing. Another train leaving at 8:30 PM is a local train, stopping at Zhenjiang. The Shanghai-Hangzhou line added one train from the 23rd, stopping at Hangzhou.</p>
<h3>Gunfire Heard Near Jiangwan Last Night The Cause is Unknown After a Long Time</h3>
<p>[United Press Local News] Last night, rumors spread repeatedly that "small-scale conflicts" had occurred in the suburbs, leaving reporters and American officials puzzled. Residents near Jiangwan claimed to have heard gunfire, ranging from machine guns to howitzers. American officials at Jiangwan Airport said they heard sporadic gunfire just after 9 PM, lasting for fifteen to thirty minutes. The details are unknown, but it is speculated that the gunfire came from between Jiangwan Airport and the Qiujiang Wharf. Chinese troops patrol in this area. When our reporter asked a certain American officer, he said: "It is also possible that the Chinese army is holding night exercises. If that is the case, we hope they will notify us in advance."</p>
<p>General Middleton, the Chief Judge, swore to be neutral before the U.S. Military Court Trial of Japanese war criminals.</p>
<h3>Health Bureau Invites Reporters to Visit Various Facilities</h3>
<p>— Our Reporter Mai Tian</p>
<p>The Municipal Health Bureau held a city tour yesterday afternoon, inviting more than twenty reporters to take two ambulances. They departed at 2:00 PM, led by Xiang Jingfang, Director of the Environmental Health Department and Director of the Municipal Sanitarium, and first arrived at the Third District Health Center on Baylor Road.</p>
<p>The Work of the Health Center</p>
<p>The Third District Health Center's building is quite elegant. It used to be used by the French Engineering Bureau to treat foreigners. The Chinese clinic was set up in the broken room behind it. The establishment of health centers is based on the division of district offices, with a total of eight centers. The main tasks are: [1] Pharmaceutical management, which is currently starting the investigation work. [2] Environmental sanitation, making the greatest efforts to deal with excrement, garbage, and street cleaning. In addition, food is inspected. A card system is used for every wine stall and restaurant, and investigations are conducted at any time. [3] Epidemic prevention and health care. Recently, six or seven nurses and one doctor have been vaccinating in various schools, and 22,000 people have been vaccinated so far. The second step is to vaccinate in factories and large stores. Groups of more than 100 people can request nurses to come and vaccinate them for free. The Third District Health Center also has a venereal disease prevention and treatment center, which can begin prostitute inspections after consultation with the Social Bureau and the Police Bureau. Currently, the clinic does not have beds, but the registration fee for outpatient visits is only 20 yuan. The obstetrics department has an external delivery department, which sends midwives to the homes of pregnant women to deliver babies every day, and the fees are also very low. Their social service department has specially invited experts to investigate patients' homes and provide free diagnosis and treatment.</p>
<p>Hospital Equipment Complete</p>
<p>The Municipal Second Hospital, located on Duojia Road, a remote part of Nanshi, has a very new building, which was renovated with a large amount of funds after receiving the Nanshi Hospital from the enemy puppets. It now has 50 beds, and will be expanded to 200 beds in the future. The equipment in the hospital is very comprehensive. The fluoroscope is a relic of the former municipal government and is the only one in the municipal hospitals. Each fluoroscopy costs 200 yuan. The second distribution area of the Relief Administration is also located in the hospital.</p>
<p>Large-Scale Slaughterhouse</p>
<p>After circling around Nanshi, we arrived at the slaughterhouse on Shajing Road in Hongkou. As soon as we entered the door, we saw a large pile of slaughtered cattle, ready to be sent to the butcher shop. This slaughterhouse is the largest in Shanghai, established by the Public Works Bureau on December 5, 1933. The beef that Shanghai people eat every day comes from here. Now, 280 large cattle, 20 calves, 140 sheep, and 2 horses are slaughtered every day. Pigs are slaughtered at the Nanyang Bridge Slaughterhouse. There, 100 pigs are slaughtered for the U.S. military every time, six or seven times a month. Livestock are inspected before and after slaughter. Thousands of old cattle in the cowshed, with their heads drooping, were waiting for the arrival of the god of death. Seeing this tragic scene, I couldn't help but feel moved. They slaughter cattle by first applying electricity to the sides of the cattle's ears, which anesthetizes and stuns them. Then they fall down from a rectangular grid, and the workers use knives to kill them. Then they are hooked up by hanging iron hooks, and the heart and lungs are put into a bucket while the skin is peeled off. It only takes ten minutes to complete the slaughter of one head of cattle. There are 31 cattle slaughtering pits in the slaughterhouse. The slaughtering fee is 20 yuan per head of cattle, 11 yuan per pig, and 10 yuan per sheep. Pigs were slaughtered using machines before, but they cannot be used now due to insufficient coal. The Japanese also did not use them for a long time during their occupation.</p>
<p>In the lower slaughterhouse, workers were sawing slaughtered cattle in half with saws, and the cattle feet were hanging separately on iron hooks, dripping with blood. The lives of livestock are ended with such treatment.</p>
<p>Alarming Drug Addicts</p>
<p>Next to the Baziqiao on Yokohama Road, Guanbei, facing the Xiaohongbang River, stands a three-story gray-walled building, which is the Municipal Anti-Smoking Hospital. There are currently 72 beds and 41 male and female smokers, of which 20 have been cured. According to the survey results, 14 people smoke opium, 25 people smoke heroin, and 2 people inject morphine intravenously. There are various reasons for drug use, of which as many as 11 people started smoking for socializing. According to the hospital authorities, there are about 600,000 drug addicts in Shanghai. No wonder the municipal government is so urgent to deal with drug addicts.</p>
<p>Municipal Sanatorium</p>
<p>Finally, we circled around to the Municipal Sanatorium on Daxi Road, which used to be the nurses' dormitory of the Public Works Bureau Hospital. When you walk past the red building on Daxi Road, you will definitely praise the magnificence of this building. The equipment inside is conceivable. There are now 60 patients living in the sanatorium, most of whom are suffering from tuberculosis. The special rooms have bedrooms and reception rooms, and the daily hospitalization fee is 800 to 1,200 yuan. First class is 800 yuan, third class A is free of accommodation fee, and class B is completely free. Currently, because the personnel receiving the Health Bureau have no place to live, they are temporarily using it as a dormitory, and the entire eighth floor is planned to be used as a ward in the future.</p>
<p>Each ward has a balcony, with plenty of light and air, and a quiet environment. This is an ideal place to recover in Shanghai. Even if we don't envy the patients' pain, we must envy them living in such a comfortable environment.</p>
<h3>Demands for Improved Treatment Continue, Various Industries See Further Slowdowns, Mediation in the Department Store Industry Reaches a Dead End</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Workers at eight major department stores, including Wing On, Sincere, The Sun, New Shanghai, Lihua, China National Products, China Emporium, and Youli, staged a three-hour slowdown from 2:00 to 5:00 PM the day before yesterday to demand improved treatment. Yesterday morning, there was still no response from management, so they implemented another slowdown after the noon siren. In addition, the Lian'an Department Store on Lin Sen Middle Road also joined the slowdown starting at 2:00 PM. According to this reporter's investigation, if the labor unrest is not resolved immediately, the labor side is preparing to organize a march of 10,000 department store employees and related workers. The demands put forward by the labor side vary slightly from company to company. Workers at Sincere, The Sun, Lihua, China Emporium, and Youli are demanding a minimum salary of 35,000 yuan, and a salary of 60,000 yuan for section chiefs. Workers at Wing On are demanding a salary increase of 200% based on December salaries, and the implementation of a seniority system, with a 10% increase for every three years of service. The management side is also taking unified action, participating in a wage review meeting at the Social Affairs Bureau at 10:00 AM yesterday, with representatives from municipal administrative agencies in attendance. It is reported that the minimum salary for employees of the eight companies will be 30,000 yuan, with employees responsible for their own food and lodging. As for other details, the labor and management sides will negotiate separately. Throughout yesterday, the labor and management sides did not have any contact. The labor side stated that if they are ignored again, they will implement a strike.</p>
<p>Resolution of Barber Slowdown Expected</p>
<p>Over 1,500 barbershops in this city implemented a full slowdown starting at 10:00 AM yesterday. The labor side's demands are as follows: 35% of the daily revenue of first-class shops should go to worker wages, and 65% should go to management. For second and third-class shops, the labor side should receive 40% and management should receive 60%. Customer tips should be distributed entirely to the workers, and shop owners should not deduct from them. In addition, they are demanding three meals a day, one congee and two rice meals, and that shop owners not dismiss workers without cause, among other nine conditions. At 2:00 PM yesterday, labor and management representatives were dispatched to mediate jointly by the Social Affairs Bureau and the Municipal Party Headquarters. The resolution was that first-class shops would split profits 35% for labor and 65% for management, with two rice meals and one congee provided. Second and third-class shops would split profits 40/60, but with a monthly salary of 1,500 yuan, two congee meals and one rice meal, and the elimination of miscellaneous fees, with other meals remaining the same.</p>
<p>Mediation for the Electric Power Company Tomorrow</p>
<p>After the Shanghai Electric Power Company experienced another slowdown the day before yesterday, all offices of the Electric Power Company were closed yesterday because employees were gathered at the Yangshupu Main Factory. Around 5:00 PM, Zhou Xuexiang, a representative from the General Labor Union, Wang Xianqing, a representative from the Municipal Party Headquarters, and Zhu Chenghao, a representative from the Social Affairs Bureau, went together to persuade them, but the labor side insisted that they would not resume work until all conditions were met to the satisfaction of the management. However, it was guaranteed that the current would not be interrupted. It is reported that the Administrative Standing Committee has decided to convene a final mediation meeting at the Social Affairs Bureau at 10:00 AM on the 26th.</p>
<p>Mediation of the Commercial Press Labor Unrest Today</p>
<p>After all employees of the Commercial Press presented demands for improved treatment, the labor and management sides negotiated on their own without success. They began a slowdown yesterday and sent representatives to petition the Social Affairs Bureau, which agreed to convene both parties for formal mediation at 10:00 AM this morning.</p>
<p>Textile Workers Demand Year-End Bonus</p>
<p>More than 16,000 textile factory workers from 17 factories in this city, including Gongda, Yufeng, and Tongxing, submitted requests to the Cotton Textile Industry Labor Union of the third and fourth districts on the 15th, demanding that year-end bonuses be issued equally, regardless of grade, at one and a half months' salary, and that six yards of Indanthrene cloth be issued to each person in lieu of work clothes, calculated according to recent wages. Based on this, the labor union made an oral request to the management on the 16th, and a written request on the 19th and 23rd. However, there has been no response to date. The workers believe that China Textile Company lacks sincerity, so they slowed down work yesterday. Party and government agencies immediately sent personnel to mediate late at night. It is reported that the management has agreed to issue the six yards of cloth, but the year-end bonus issue still needs to be discussed. It is scheduled that the Social Affairs Bureau will convene mediation together with relevant agencies at 10:00 AM this morning.</p>
<p>Jeep Drivers Given a Deadline to Resume Work</p>
<p>All Chinese drivers, coppersmiths, and laborers, totaling over two thousand, at the U.S. Army Headquarters Transportation Department in Shanghai, have been on a full slowdown since Tuesday of this week, which has not yet been resolved. Before the slowdown, they requested the management authorities to (1) double their wages, (2) issue a one-month year-end bonus, (3) pay the salary increase in U.S. dollars, and (4) not deduct wages for days off. Yesterday, the management authorities issued a notice that all Chinese personnel on slowdown are required to report to work by the 25th, otherwise new workers will be hired to fill the positions.</p>
<h3>The Great Artery of Transportation: Employees of the Two Railways Strictly Guard Their Posts, Inheriting Past Honors to Maintain Transportation</h3>
<p>— Reporter of this newspaper, Xingwu</p>
<p>The surging labor unrest has made every Shanghai citizen uneasy. Yesterday morning, on the bustling streets, another kind of green printed leaflet with the signature "Railway Employees" was found. Therefore, rumors flew around, and everyone was worried that Shanghai's great artery would also be swept into the vortex of the labor unrest.</p>
<p>No Signs of Labor Unrest at the Station</p>
<p>In order to understand the truth of the matter, this reporter made a special trip to the North Railway Station. There was nothing unusual at the station, and not a single leaflet could be found. The workers were busy working. I grabbed one and secretly asked him about the motive for posting the "declaration," but unexpectedly, he didn't know anything about it. This was the case for several people in a row. They had no knowledge of any leaflets at all, and there was no sign of labor unrest about to occur. Therefore, I also visited the general stationmaster, Tong Shida. Through his introduction, I also met Ouyang Zhi, the section chief.</p>
<p>Section Chief Expresses Determination to Investigate Conspiracy</p>
<p>Although they knew that there were leaflets being posted outside, they did not yet know the content of the leaflets. After I told him, the section chief was silent for a while and said: "This must be a conspiracy by the 'black hats' who were dismissed from 'Hua Zhen' before. We must investigate!" He also pointed out the recent salary adjustment table for employees, which, according to the orders of the Executive Yuan, is divided into four grades, each divided into six levels. The highest level, super grade one, is 34,000 yuan, and the lowest level, grade C six, is 21,000 yuan. Most of the employees have been given increases of three to five levels this month, in addition to rice subsidies and temporary subsidies. Therefore, the section chief said, "Our wages are more than enough compared to those below us."</p>
<p>Labor Union Declares No Knowledge</p>
<p>At the same time, the councils of the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway Labor Unions solemnly declared that although the salaries of the employees of the two railways are still insufficient to maintain their livelihoods, they are willing to follow proper procedures and petition the Ministry of Transportation for adjustments. They absolutely do not know anything about the leaflets attacking the railway administration that were discovered on the 16th and yesterday, and do not want to participate. The employees of the two railways are determined to maintain their past honor, love the railway, and strictly guard their posts.</p>
<p>Continuous Improvement of Various Facilities</p>
<p>Section Chief Ouyang also led me to visit various places. First and second-class passengers have waiting rooms, and the brand-new sofas are filled with male and female passengers. Anti-Japanese war paintings hang on the light yellow walls. There are newspapers and paintings, which can truly be said to be perfect! The ladies in the broadcasting room report every three to five minutes, providing guidance to passengers at any time. The platforms are swept clean, and the newly renovated dining cars are already serving on the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou lines. The velvet sofas in the first and second-class carriages on the Beijing-Shanghai line have been newly upholstered. Long tables have also been installed between the two seats, where tea can be brewed and meals can be eaten. The section chief said that the sleeper cars will also be renovated soon. Because of the congestion of passengers, they are trying their best to increase the number of passenger cars. Now each train has an average of fourteen cars, which is half more than before, but it is still not enough to meet the demand. The most hateful thing is that the ignorant coolies often break the glass windows of the passenger cars. Recently, there has also been the appearance of "scalpers." To prevent the generation of black market tickets, the police department has stepped up its prevention. The station can catch several every day. Under all kinds of restrictions, the railway facilities are still constantly being improved.</p>
<h3>Remembering Dr. John Calvin Ferguson: Please Restore the Original Road Name</h3>
<p>American Dr. John Calvin Ferguson served China's education, culture, and industry for 57 years, and made many contributions. After the Pacific War, he was arrested by the enemy for assisting in the war of resistance. After being exchanged for expatriates and returning to the United States, he eventually succumbed to illness and passed away in New York. His friends Wang Genzhong, Xi Yushu, Xu Peixian, Biao Weiyu, etc., believe that Dr. Ferguson made contributions to China, and have jointly written a letter to the Municipal Government of this city, requesting that Ferguson Road, which was renamed by the enemy and puppets, be restored to its original name to commemorate him, and that a memorial service be held on a regular basis. The original letter stated: "Dr. Ferguson personally founded Nanjing University and taught at Jiaotong University (formerly Nanyang Public School) in this city, nurturing talents and producing outstanding individuals, who have now become the backbone of various undertakings in our country. After the National Government established its capital in Nanjing, he devoted himself to his duties and spared no effort. During the War of Resistance, Dr. Ferguson was filled with righteous indignation and provided even more assistance to our war of resistance. Because of this, he was resented by the enemy and was arrested after the Pacific War. After being exchanged for expatriates and released, he returned to his homeland, but eventually passed away due to his advanced age and inability to withstand the hardships. Now that victory has come and the country is being rebuilt, the state is promoting the recognition of loyal and heroic individuals to encourage future generations. Dr. Ferguson, as an ally, resided in this land for a total of 57 years. Throughout his life, he embodied the spirit of impartiality and service, and eliminated the prejudices of strength and weakness. All that he did benefited our country and our people. The principle of honoring virtue and repaying merit leaves no exceptions. We initiate a memorial service to express our admiration. We also propose to restore the original name of Ferguson Road in this city, which was renamed by the enemy and puppets, so that it may be remembered forever."</p>
<h3>Luo Xuelian, Representative of the Central Propaganda Department, Discusses the Mission of the Film Service Center, Explaining External Rumors</h3>
<p>Recently, there have been rumors about the Central Film Service Center established by the Central Propaganda Department and the department's dispatch of personnel to the recovered areas to take over the film industry institutions of the enemy and puppets. According to Luo Xuelian, the representative of the Central Propaganda Department stationed in Shanghai, the establishment of the Central Film Service Center is aimed at rationally distributing films, using the profits to support film production, and avoiding manipulation by film merchants. Its organization and business have been approved by the Central Government. The center has been established for more than two years and was not established in Shanghai after the war, nor is it privately operated. Its scheduling of films for theaters and its agency distribution of Chinese and foreign films are based on mutual agreement and contract execution.</p>
<p>There is absolutely no coercion. The service fees charged by the center are only for theaters or film holders who have a contractual relationship with it, and the fees are much lower than those of ordinary commercial operators. Like ordinary public institutions, it charges handling fees for film screenings by various institutions, groups, factories, and schools due to actual needs (originally 1,000 yuan per screening, recently changed to 2,000 yuan) to cover the cost of equipment. There is absolutely no charge for screening domestic newsreels or newsreels borrowed free of charge from the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union. If the applying unit requests to designate a certain film for screening, it must sublet it from the film holder. Therefore, there are charges of tens of thousands of yuan (the highest is no more than 50,000 yuan). This charge includes film rental, equipment consumption fees, and transportation and meal expenses for equipment handlers and staff. The applying unit is provided with a triplicate receipt issued by the Central Government, and the film holder also receives a formal receipt. All expenses are audited by the Central Government. The center was originally a wartime organization and achieved great results in the rear. Whether it will be abolished or reorganized in the future will depend on the needs. This time, the Central Propaganda Department sent personnel to various recovered areas to take over the cultural institutions operated by the enemy and puppets, including film, but all were handled in accordance with the "Provisional Measures for the Management of Newspapers, News Agencies, Film, and Broadcasting Industries in Recovered Areas" approved and promulgated by the Central Standing Committee. The center is not responsible for the takeover, but only temporarily takes over the relevant business after the takeover, which is also temporary. All takeover work is temporarily used after the takeover in order to cooperate with the post war reconstruction work in the recovered areas, which has also been approved by the Central Government. The technical personnel and low-level employees in various film theaters and film studios who were originally working under the control of the enemy and puppets are temporarily retained for work reasons, and the number is minimal, just as the personnel of agencies or factories who handle handover during the surrender of the Japanese army are retained for business needs to prevent work from being interrupted. As for Shanghai-produced films, in accordance with the regulations of the Central Government, all films produced in Shanghai before the outbreak of the Pacific War that do not violate the current film censorship standards can be publicly screened throughout the country after being reviewed and approved by the Central Drama and Film Censorship Institute. Changing the film title is, of course, the right of the film holder. Those produced under the control of the enemy and puppets after the outbreak of the Pacific War are all recognized as puppet films, and are absolutely prohibited from screening. After the victory of the War of Resistance, the center only handled applications for review of domestic films in the interior. As for acting as an agent for distribution, there was only Mr. Fei Mu's "Hong Xuanjiao." In addition, it did not act as an agent for any domestic films, let alone puppet films. The Central Government has always intended to support the film industry and make it cooperate with the promotion of national policy. If there are any inadequacies in the handling, we sincerely hope that the pioneers of the cultural world will provide guidance with a proactive attitude. If there are any illegal acts by the handlers, we also hope that they can provide evidence with a responsible attitude and sue the competent authorities.</p>
<h3>Securities Exchange Preparing to Resume Business</h3>
<p>Since the order to handle the affairs of the China Securities Exchange, the matter of preparing to resume business is currently under careful discussion and planning. However, important facilities must be handled in accordance with the relevant authorities, and resolved by the council of the exchange. Regarding the number of brokers, there are currently no regulations. However, it is heard that the qualifications for future brokers, their regulations, and their review will be very strict. It is also heard that the preparation for the exchange's resumption of business is unlikely to be realized in the near future.</p>
<h3>Rogernikov Released</h3>
<p>[United Press, This City] The U.S. Army Headquarters in the China Theater announced today that former Russian boxer Rogernikov, who was previously suspected of war crimes against U.S. military personnel and investigated by the U.S. Army authorities, has been released after swearing an oath, as there was no concrete evidence.</p>
<h3>Weather Forecast</h3>
<p>The center of the Siberian anticyclone is stable in North China, and the tropical air mass is encroaching on this area. The low pressure center in Jiangxi is advancing slowly to the northeast east.</p>
<p>Weather forecast: The Yellow Sea will be clear and cold, turning cloudy, with haze, wind direction uncertain, wind force moderate. This area will be clear to cloudy, mild turning cold, with fog in the morning, wind force light to moderate. The East China Sea will be overcast, wind direction uncertain, wind force moderate.

<h3>Rascal Demands Year-End Bonus, Chops Eleven Times, Both Person and Dog Injured</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Wang Peifeng, 45 years old, of No. 8, Lane 2, Yunnan Road, formerly Lao Guo of the Maritime Tour Guide Agency, had several rascals come to his residence around 11:20 AM yesterday to demand a year-end bonus from the former Tour Guide Agency. When they disagreed, they brandished a kitchen knife and stabbed him in the head four times. At that time, Wang's house had a hunting dog, which bit the rascals, and was also hit in the head with seven chops. Afterwards, they fled in a rush. The injured person was sent to Renji Hospital for treatment, and the injured dog was sent to the Asian Veterinary Hospital for diagnosis.</p>

<p>Commercial News</p>
<h3>Gold Market Sentiment Slightly Affected, Futures Fall 14,000, US Dollars and Hong Kong Notes Slightly Decline</h3>
<p>The gold market was slightly affected yesterday because the market in the wartime capital was down, and because of news reports that the authorities' ban on gold as collateral for loans would be temporarily suspended. The opening in the morning retreated to 923,000. Overnight floats were closed one after another, so it went downstream from 926,000, retreating to 907,000 at one point, and then stabilized slightly, hovering around 915,000 until noon. Later trading was even more scarce. Overnight delivery once called as high as 922,000, but it did not last, and finally hovered within 915,000. As a result, spot delivery rose slightly by 9,000 compared to the previous close, and overnight delivery fell by 14,000. Gold jewelry was listed at 98,000, refined silver at 800 yuan, and silver dollars at 480 yuan. There were still more sellers, the buying price was 470 yuan, and the under-the-table interest rate still stood at 10 to 13 cents.</p>
<p>Foreign currency U.S. dollars were still suppressed by physical goods. Since 1,475 yuan, supply continuously exceeded demand, and the arbitrage price always fluctuated around 625 yuan. Gradually affected by the gold market, the price fell to below 1,460 yuan, struggling around 1,465 yuan at noon, and still hovered at the original price in the afternoon. As a result, it fell by 17 yuan compared to the previous close. Hong Kong notes fell because overseas remittances concentrated in Hong Kong, and the local legal tender in Hong Kong tended to rise. Old notes fell by 5 yuan, while new notes fell by 2 yuan due to unfavorable news about new notes in Chinese and Western newspapers, causing a trend of selling.</p>
<h3>Major Investors Lack Support, Chinese Stocks Trend Downward, Foreign Stocks Also Retreat in Unison</h3>
<p>Chinese stocks continued to hover, and sentiment was not as excited as in the previous days. Although the opening in the morning was similar to the previous close, it did not advance but retreated, causing many parties to close. Although major investors were cautious and resisted every step of the way, the general trend finally failed. Wing On Yarn fell from 1,640 yuan to 1,540 yuan, and Mayar retreated from 1,130 yuan to 1,040 yuan. Among the "three small" popular stocks, except for New Shanghai, which was assisted by major investors and rose from 73 yuan to around 80 yuan, low-priced major investors and banks slightly increased their holdings, and at noon, it was slightly agitated. As a result, Wing On Yarn and Mayar each fell by more than 50 yuan compared to the previous close, Xinhe fell by 30 yuan, Jingfu fell by 4 yuan, Qinxing fell by 2.5 yuan, New Shanghai was flat, China Textile fell by 30 yuan, Wing On fell by 50 yuan, and various unpopular stocks also deteriorated again.</p>
<p>Those in the foreign stock industry were even more cautious. Trading was quiet, and customers, in view of the unfavorable news, did not dare to intervene in activities. Trading unfolded under extreme secrecy, and Jardine stocks felt unsustainable and retreated. The afternoon close resulted in Jardine Yarn falling by 150 yuan, and Jardine Brewery and Steel each falling by 100 yuan, Jardine Matheson fell by 50 yuan, and British American Tobacco also fell by 150. The asking price for Hutchison Whampoa Paper slightly retreated, but the selling price did not change.</p>
<h3>Bond Market Dull, Narrow Premium, Little Change</h3>
<p>The public debt gradually stabilized after falling. Type C opened flat in the morning, fell to 1,450 yuan after opening, and then began to stabilize, but supply and demand were scattered, so it rebounded to 1,585 yuan. The premium was narrow, and major investors did not want to engage in more activities. All of it was left to retail investors to settle on their own, and the process had no special changes. Miscellaneous brands had little stimulation, and as a result, Type C and Type E rose slightly due to their popularity, while Type A and Type B fell slightly.</p>
<h3>Construction Company Continues to Sell, Yarn Sales Do Not Diminish</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the yarn market continued to trend upward. Transactions from mainland merchants came from a source, and the Changzhou cloth factory was particularly keen to purchase 20s and 32s raw materials, so the price increased by 10,000 to 20,000 yuan. The Construction Company continued to offer a large amount of goods, but sentiment was not discouraged by this, because there is still hope for sales to expand.</p>
<h3>Artificial Silk Has Ups and Downs, Factory Business Has No Major Changes</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the artificial silk market had mixed ups and downs. Filament and 75 semi-gloss were relatively lifeless, but 150 was in greater demand than supply, and the price was the most stable. 120 Tiantiao opened at 1.1 million yuan and closed at 1.15 million yuan. The afternoon was similar. The lowest price for Qian Yuan was 710,000 yuan, and then it rose to 760,000 yuan, which was 40,000 yuan less than the previous day. Trading was very quiet. The general market for factory business had no changes. Others were slightly higher by 10,000 to 20,000 yuan. Some people were pulling up the price of the transfer of goods Da Cheng Ge Bi crepe, with the highest price being 2,550 yuan per yard, and then 2,470 yuan. The American Mayar brocade and Minsheng brocade still followed the original market from the previous day.</p>
<h3>Cotton Cloth Sales Active</h3>
<p>Yesterday, cotton cloth trading picked up somewhat, and prices also improved, each rising by 10,000 to 20,000 yuan. Sichuan merchants and Hankou merchants, because there were ships about to set sail, were in a hurry to chase after blue cloth, shirt poplin, and Shilin spot goods, but the supply of gray cloth base was still not smooth.</p>
<h3>Factory Merchants Purchase Spot Cotton</h3>
<p>Yesterday, spot cotton trading was good, mostly by Chinese merchants. It was estimated that 42s raw material American cotton high-grade middling flower price was 65,000 yuan, and second-grade price was 58,000 yuan. 32s raw material Da Zhong Ji price was 75,000 yuan. 20s raw material Qidong Sanyuzhen flower price was 65,000 yuan, and Tongzhou flower price was 57,500 yuan. The above were all factory prices. 16s raw material Huoji seed flower sold for 8,000 yuan, and the price was more stable than the previous day. No goods were heard to have arrived at the dock.</p>
<h3>Rice Market Continues to Be Weak</h3>
<p>The rice market was sluggish because the amount of rice accumulated in the north and south markets was strong, about two or three hundred ships, and the market was dull. It was also heard that old Saigon rice was being sold, which made sentiment extremely soft and caused a unanimous decline. Northern japonica rice fell by 300 to 400 yuan, early thin rice fell by more than 500 yuan, and indica rice also fell by 400 to 500 yuan. Although white glutinous rice has demand due to the approaching New Year, the arrival was quite strong, so it fell by 500 to 600 yuan, and Yin Yuan’s middle and lower levels fell sharply by 600 to 700 yuan. Flour has been stopped in other places and is ending the year-end accounts. The local street is still quiet, and the price has also fallen by 200 to 300 yuan. Post-shaped rice flour is still not optimistic. The oil market is firm, soybean cake has risen by 100 yuan, and raw beans have changed from retail to stock, rising by 100 to 200 yuan. Raw peanuts have increased sharply, but recently, there have been arrivals from Guide and Kaifeng in Henan Province, as well as Qingdao Road in Shandong Province. The wine market has strong demand due to the need for the New Year, and digestion is very strong, rising another 1,000 yuan, and the situation is still trending upward.</p>
<h3>Tea Prices Only Increase, Do Not Decrease</h3>
<p>The tea market is approaching the Lunar New Year, and in addition to the sustained removal of goods by merchants, local shops also have considerable intent, and sentiment is upward. Holders are holding on, so transaction prices are only increasing and not decreasing.</p>
<h3>Paper Prices Vary, Will Be Flattened</h3>
<p>The price of foreign paper is soaring, especially the price of drawing paper. Compared with the current market and before the war, there are obvious differences. White newsprint has reached 10,000 times, drawing paper 4,000 times, and kraft paper 3,000 times. The wartime market price is often not based on cost as the standard, but on sales as the basis. Now the war is over, and it is gradually entering a peacetime state. The differences in paper prices will also be flattened. Recently, the price of drawing paper has been rising the most, which has already seen this motive. The foreign price is fixed at the pre-war average, regardless of the type of paper, so it is predicted that the goods that were deserted during the war will gradually become popular, and the above-mentioned differences in multiples will naturally be adjusted.</p>
<h3>Stable Timber Market, Willow Oak Price Stands Out Alone</h3>
<p>The timber market is generally quite stable, but the price of large shipments of Willow Oak is quite firm. It is said that the woodworking industry has a use for it, leading to people collecting it. Willow Oak plywood has also quietly risen in price. These two types of timber are the standard products in the timber industry, and there are people who favor them. It is rumored that Willow Oak rounds have been negotiated with foreign countries, with the price expected to be around 120 US dollars.</p>
<h3>Summary of Market Conditions</h3>
<p>Bananas and Guangdong sugarcane oranges, unseen for many years, have been shipped in large quantities since the resumption of navigation between Shanghai and Hong Kong after the victory. Yesterday, the British ship "Ysheng" arrived in Shanghai from Hong Kong, bringing another large batch of 6,500 cases of bananas, 1,200 cases of sugarcane, and 400 cases of oranges. The Xin Ruian ship returned to Shanghai from Fujian, carrying more than 300 boxes of longan.</p>

<h3>New Trends in Social Education After the War: Eradicating Illiteracy and Reorganizing Mass Education, Social Education Institutions Providing Remedial Education Concurrently, Capital to Establish Tutoring Schools</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Chongqing] Social education is for the purpose of eradicating illiteracy. The adult out-of-school schools that were established before the war have, since the promulgation of the National Education Law in the 29th year of the Republic, reformed adult out-of-school education by establishing adult departments in national schools.</p>
<p>National Schools</p>
<p>Each county establishes a central national school in the townships and towns, and each Bao establishes a national school in the township. The above two types of national schools are divided into two departments, one for children and one for adults. Adult out-of-school mass education is attached to the national schools, and all social education institutions are further engaged in advanced remedial education for the masses, from higher elementary to junior high, senior high, and specialized vocational training, with agricultural, industrial, and commercial subjects.</p>
<p>Tutoring Schools</p>
<p>In the capital area, tutoring schools and branches have long been established in Chongqing and rural villages, and schools attached to factories, totaling about 20 classes, with about 2,000 students. During the post-war education recovery, the Ministry of Education plans to establish this tutoring school in the capital to promote it, and is in the process of planning. However, the results of the national schools running adult mass education for several years have been slow in various provinces and cities, and many have not met the standards.</p>
<p>Mass Schools</p>
<p>Now that the work of education recovery in the recovered areas is widely open, in the future, in addition to using broadcast education and electrical education, it is still planned to supervise various social education institutions to set up mass schools, and to promote them in various ways, in order to eradicate illiteracy as soon as possible. It is also heard that the mass school textbooks used before the war have been revised for a long time, and are divided into adult class textbooks and women's class textbooks, totaling eight volumes, which will be printed and distributed by the designated bookstore United Public Printing Office.

<h3>Education Vice Minister Hang Liwu Talks About the National Provisional University Student Unrest</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency News] Hang Liwu, the Permanent Vice Minister of Education, arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing a few days ago. Yesterday, he told reporters that the incident of students at the Nanjing Provisional University insulting Director Wang Shulin has come to an end. The professors once went on strike, but have continued to teach at the request of the majority of students who wanted to resume classes. As for the students who caused the trouble, they are now being handled by the court. The outcome is a judicial matter, and we cannot interfere. Hang continued, "In addition to establishing the Shanghai branch of the Sino-British Cultural Association, this trip will also inspect the National Provisional University tutoring classes and other schools."</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 24th] It is heard that the detained students who caused trouble at the National Provisional University are on a hunger strike this morning.</p>
<h3>Universities in Wuhan and Guangzhou to Set Up Remedial Classes</h3>
<p>[Dahua News Agency, Nanjing] In order to rectify schools in the recovered areas and improve the standard of education, the Ministry of Education has successively established provisional university tutoring classes in Nanjing, Shanghai, Jifu, Beiping and other places, to accommodate students from various universities in the recovered areas and give them remedial opportunities, so that they can transfer to formal universities in the future and obtain legal academic qualifications. Recently, the ministry, considering that many students in Wuhan and Guangzhou have not been able to enjoy this preferential treatment, has specifically dispatched personnel to investigate the situation in the two places within a few days and set them up accordingly.</p>
<h3>Statistics on Qualifications and Number of Primary School Teachers in Shanghai</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] The Shanghai Education Bureau recently compiled statistics on 1,316 teachers and staff in the city.

<h3>Public Education Personnel Adjustment of Treatment</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Chongqing, 24th] The treatment of public education personnel has been adjusted. Starting this month, it has been determined to be 30,000 yuan for living allowances, and salaries are still calculated at 100 times. However, the rice allowance has been abolished.</p>
<h3>National Central University Relocation Expenses Approved at 200 Million Yuan, Chengdu Medical College to Join the Eastward Move</h3>
<p>[Dahua News Agency, Chongqing and Hangzhou News] The National Central University Rehabilitation Committee has gradually started its work, and the heads of the five groups have also been selected. Professor Zhang Geng is in charge of the investigation group, Professor Kong Lianggui is in charge of the transportation group, the engineering group has not yet been determined, Hong Fanwu is in charge of the finance group, and Director Yang is in charge of the general affairs group. However, the school recently received a telegram from the Ministry of Military and Political Affairs, intending to borrow the Nanjing school buildings for six months, which made the students quite uneasy. Therefore, the Nanjing school buildings have not been completely taken over, and a part of them has been borrowed by the Provisional University. Most of the buildings need to be repaired, and furniture and desks need to be replaced. If the school buildings are completely borrowed, the school relocation this summer will become a problem. Moreover, the school had only more than 1,000 students before, and now it has increased to more than 5,000. Even if all the existing school buildings are taken over, they will not be enough. Therefore, the school has requested the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration to allocate 600 American mobile homes for use as student dormitories. As for the relocation expenses, which are quite huge, the Ministry of Education has previously requested to allocate 600 million yuan, but now 200 million yuan has been approved. It is feared that adding new school buildings will not be enough. It is also heard that the Chengdu Medical College of the school will move to Chongqing at the end of April after the end of April, and then move eastward together. Another saying is that after the Longhai Railway is open, they will first take a car to Baoji, and then transfer to a train to Beijing.</p>
<h3>Haiyuan Pavilion Collection to be Shipped to Beiping Within Days</h3>

<h3>Director Xu of the Zhejiang Education Department Announces Future Facilities for Secondary Education</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] Xu Shaodi, Director of the Zhejiang Education Department, announced that the future facilities for secondary education should follow the central education policy and the actual situation in the province, in order to cooperate with the "Destiny of China" and actively cultivate talents for the five constructions. At the same time, under the central instructions of "seeking quantitative development on the one hand, and seeking qualitative improvement on the other," it is decided that secondary education should emphasize quality over quantity, teacher education should emphasize both quality and quantity, and vocational education should emphasize quantity over quality. The development should be average. The ratio of high school, teacher training, and high vocational schools should be 2:1:1, and the ratio of junior high, simplified teacher training, and junior vocational schools should be 6:3:1. Junior secondary schools in each county should be universal and distributed, so that one-third to one-half of the graduates of the central national schools can be accommodated for further studies. Women's education should be promoted in secondary schools, and there should be a considerable proportion of male and female students. Secondary education should pay special attention to science education to meet the needs of the times. The province should be divided into several secondary school districts, so that the secondary schools in each county in each district can enroll students, and research and improvement matters can be carried out in a unified manner. The funding for secondary education should be provided in addition to the government's budget to meet actual needs.</p>

<p>The Bomber team and the Wildcats started fighting, and both sides used brute force to fight hard. In the first half, the Bomber team led 16 to 13. In the second half, the Bomber team was able to take flexibility from rigidity, while the Wildcats only used brute force. Therefore, the Bomber team finally won with a score of 30 to 23. The Bomber team's basketball skills are quite impressive. It is a pity that they will be leaving Shanghai tomorrow and the day after tomorrow, which is a great regret.</p>

<h3>A Glimpse of the Southwest Associated University (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Shen Shi</p>
<p>The Southwest Associated University, a joint product of Peking, Tsinghua, and Nankai Universities during the Anti-Japanese War, stood tall in the Southwest for eight years, fulfilling its unique mission and its due responsibility. It persevered through repeated evacuations and endured numerous intense bombings, remaining steadfast and never ceasing its scholarly pursuits. Thorns and bitterness forged a brilliant, tear-stained history. It tells people how difficult it is to maintain an existing order, and how even more arduous it is to establish a new one. It tells people that firm faith and dauntless perseverance are necessary to establish wartime education and preserve the lifeblood of culture. Its struggles and creations earned concern from home and abroad and won unanimous praise from the nation. Countless young men and women braved blockades, traversed enemy lines, and threw themselves into this free haven, learning and researching to their hearts' content. We quietly listen to the solemn school anthem: "Ten thousand miles of the Long March, bidding farewell to the palaces of the Five Ridges, temporarily resting our feet on Mount Heng and the Xiang River, only to bid farewell again." The lingering sorrow and boundless grief of "playing the reed pipes and reciting scriptures in the mountain city, our feelings so earnest" are so captivating and inspiring. "Waiting to eradicate the enemy, restore the capital, and return to Yan and Zhao," filled with hope and faith for the future of the nation. Now that the Anti-Japanese War is won, I gaze at the clouds in the northern sky and contemplate the waters and mountains of the Southwest. I cannot help but report for the elders, brothers, and sisters who have suffered for many years under the iron heel, the arduous management of this prestigious institution in the Southwest, and the romantic stories of its years.</p>
<p>The Union of the Associated University</p>
<p>At the beginning of the Anti-Japanese War, Peking, Tsinghua, and Nankai Universities formed a temporary university in the Sacred Heart College outside Xiaowumen in Changsha. Due to the intensifying war situation, the temporary university decided to move to Kunming. Some faculty and friends went to Kunming via the Hong Kong coast. Some students, under the diligent and kind leadership of Professor Zeng Zhaolun, trekked along the newly built Southwest Highway and arrived in Kunming on foot. They borrowed the buildings of Kunhua Agricultural School to continue classes. The Changsha Temporary University was renamed the Southwest Associated University and a teachers' college was added. The new buildings outside the Great West Gate were completed, and the university's main body, including the colleges of liberal arts, law, and science, moved into the new buildings. The engineering college was located on Tuodong Road in the east of the city.</p>
<p>The Associated University replaced the president with a standing committee of three members, filled by the presidents of the three universities. Mr. Zhang Boling was old and rarely came to the university. Mr. Mei Yiqi usually presided over all internal matters, while Mr. Jiang Menglin was responsible for all external affairs. Thanks to the three members of the standing committee, their mutual trust and consultation, and their mutual tolerance and support, the huge Associated University was able to "unite and merge." There was no personal bias, no disagreement. Thousands of faculty and students sang, danced, and pursued truth and created new life and a new academic style in harmony.</p>
<p>Although the standing committee was the highest administrative body of the school and made decisions on school affairs, the majority of decisions were made by the faculty meeting, which was composed of representatives elected by the professors. The faculty meeting is truly worthy of praise and admiration. Due to their high degree of democratic style, they overcame numerous difficulties. Due to their noble character and profound knowledge, they were entrusted with the mission of inheriting the tradition of freedom and creating a new culture. They harmonized the school with the local authorities, ensured the wholehearted support and sincere obedience of thousands of students, and further promoted the "unity and merger" of the academic styles and spirits of the three schools.</p>
<p>The faculty and friends of the Associated University came from overseas and from every corner of the country, speaking different dialects. However, at gatherings, even if their Mandarin was clumsy, they had to speak it. Although their lifestyles were different, they showed special affection and kindness in their joint research and study in pursuit of truth, which invisibly enhanced the "unity and merger." The Associated University has occupied a glorious page in the history of education for the past eight years. Its development proves that the cultivation of a good academic style requires a consistent high degree of freedom and democratic spirit, and that political stability lies in tolerance, openness, and pragmatism. In other words, only democracy can usher in a new life for politics.</p>
<p>Typical Professors</p>
<p>Although the Associated University was located in remote Kunming, it faced numerous external obstacles. Thanks to the painstaking efforts of Mr. Mei and Mr. Jiang, it was able to stand tall. However, the true strength that sustained the school was the virtuous and respected professors. They were morally noble, sincere, and enthusiastic, teaching tirelessly and influencing people with virtue. They had profound knowledge and devoted all their energy to inspiring and exploring in the classroom, in the laboratory, and in field explorations. Despite the shockingly high prices, they lived simple lives and were content with poverty, which naturally won the respect of their students. The poet Wen Yiduo, in addition to teaching at Kunhua Middle School, also had to engrave seals to supplement his family's income. Mr. Yuan Fuli, who ventured alone into the sparsely populated areas of the Greater Liang Mountains, had a particularly large number of children. His books and belongings had long been sold, and he could only eat two bowls of thin porridge a day. The dignified old philosopher Jin Yuelin, after returning from lecturing in the United States, lived in the same house with Mr. Qian Duansheng. Because they couldn't afford a servant, he even had to help Mrs. Qian chop pine firewood. At one philosophy conference held in Kunming, Mr. Jin lamented in a humorous and pained tone that there were few people in the country studying Western philosophy, and that the funding for the philosophy conference was particularly short, which paled in comparison to the funding for the engineering society. But only heaven knew the contributions of the two to mankind. The upright and outspoken political commentator Zhang Xiruo, since publishing the sensational article "Specialization of Hebei and Chahar is Not Allowed" in "Independent Review," remained silent in the school despite speaking several times in the National Political Council. He encouraged students to enrich themselves and write less wall newspapers. He was once beaten by a landlord's adjutant, and the students all felt indignant for him. It is said that Mr. Zhang has not been silent in recent years. For the future of the country, he fully expressed his sense of justice. When he lectured, the classrooms were packed, and the windows were full of people. His articles were snatched up and eagerly read by everyone. Mr. Lei Haizong, who was proficient in Chinese and Western history, was amiable and kind. He once fainted on the road due to anemia. His wife worked as a small staff member at Yunnan University to support the family. The famous biologist Chen Zhen spent all day in the laboratory, becoming intimate with the microscope. He had the spirit and patience of Pasteur. I wish him success in science. The Buddhist authority, Professor Tang Yongtong, with his silver hair, spent his days studying Buddhism and rarely gave public lectures. But whenever he stepped onto the podium, the classroom was always filled with people. What is even more worthy of mention is Mr. Chen Yinque, the master of philosophy, history, and literature, whom Mr. Wu Yusan most admired. He wore a round melon-shaped hat, closed his eyes, and sat upright lecturing, his tone so soft that the people sitting below listened attentively. Mr. Wu Mi, Mr. Shen Youding, Mr. Liu Wendian, and others all went to listen to his profound theories, mentioning him to everyone and praising him. Originally, Mr. Chen was awarded an honorary chair at Oxford University before the war, but because of his weakness, he could not go and had to stay in Kunming. When Kunming suffered a heavy bombing, Mr. Chen could not run and went to teach at the University of Hong Kong. When Hong Kong fell, the enemy, awed by Mr. Chen's reputation and scholarship, sent him flour, which Mr. Chen refused to accept even to death. The enemy could do nothing. Mr. Chen later escaped and moved to Jialing. When Guilin was lost, he fled to Chengdu. When the war ended, Mr. Chen flew to England to lecture. I heard that when he passed through Kunming, he still had deep sorrow and grief. The spirit of the Associated University lies in these things. The professors were willing to protect the truth with their lives and sacrifice themselves for the truth when necessary.</p>
<p>Wallace's Ten Reviews</p>
<p>They loved the country and hoped that the country would be strong and catch up with the times. They loved the school and strived to make the school great. Their consistent goal was to protect the traditional free lecturing and free research, the beautiful academic style, and to pursue the bright truth of justice. If the truth and the free academic style suffered misfortune, they would not hesitate to defend it with their lives. This made the Associated University shine brightly, attracting students from afar to travel thousands of mountains and rivers to seek refuge in this free land of scholarship. When fascism spread across Europe and the Far East, former U.S. Vice President Henry Wallace came to China and delivered a moving speech at the Associated University, praising the Associated University as "the only democratic fortress remaining in East Asia." Undoubtedly, this was the glory of the Associated University, but it was not proud of it. It hoped that democratic politics would be popularized in all countries, so that the world would have true peace, true prosperity, and mankind would have true happiness.</p>

<h3>Playing the Lute to a Cow</h3>
<p>— Song Shouchang</p>
<p>"Playing the lute to a cow" was originally a metaphor for talking about profound principles to a foolish person. Although this metaphor is meaningless, it is very worthwhile to savor. Originally, music is not necessarily something that humans can understand. Other animals with hearing organs can also feel music. Darwin said in his "The Descent of Man": "The origin of the art of music is something that males use to attract females." His reasoning is that most male animals use their voices during the breeding season. When they call, on the one hand, they are venting their emotions, and on the other hand, they are attracting the attention of females. It can be seen that if the females cannot feel the music of the males' singing or calling, how can they be attracted?</p>
<p>In the "Shangshu Shundian" chapter, there are also words about music moving beasts: "The emperor said: Man, I order you to promote music, teach your children, be straightforward and gentle, broad and stern, firm and without emptiness, and call without arrogance. Poetry expresses intention, singing prolongs words, sound relies on prolongation, rhythm harmonizes sound, entering the sound overcomes all, without competing for the same kind, gods and men harmonize with each other. In short: When I strike the stone and play the stone, all beasts dance." It seems that this musician is a bit boastful of his skills, but when we look at modern circuses, the performances of those four-legged beasts seem to make it possible for beasts to dance. The success of this kind of training still relies on the effect of music, using the speed and slowness of the rhythm of the music, and the high and low tones to suggest their various movements. All performances follow the guidance of the music. Advances and retreats, rises and falls are all in time. The most ferocious tigers and lions are tamed like cats, and even the clumsiest elephants seem to have spirituality. This is all due to the power of music, which makes beasts resonate with the music.</p>
<p>Music has a kind of assimilation effect, because the changes in the pitch and intensity of the sound are related to physiology, and the speed is based on physiological elements, so listening to music can be affected and assimilated with it. For example, the speed of the beat is based on our pulse, so we feel comfortable with the stimulation of music. At the same time, when listening to music, we must be spiritually and physically affected by the suggestion of the sound in order to truly enjoy the beauty of music. For example, hearing the sound of a trumpet gives a feeling of soaring high, because the sound of a trumpet can make people's limbs expand; hearing the sound of a drum creates a feeling of tension and excitement, because the sound of a drum can make people enthusiastic. The relationship between the feeling of music and our spirit and body is like this, so it can be applied to the training of the movements of four-legged beasts. From Darwin's reasoning and this fact, we can see that some animals can indeed feel music, but their rationality is not as good as humans. Then, their ability to listen to music is naturally lower than that of humans. The music they can feel is only loud and rhythmically straightforward.</p>
<h3>Textual Research on Ling Tingkan's Poems on Opera (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Zhao Jingshen</p>
<p>Oblique words and delicate phrases in the Yuan opera, how endless are the vulgar jokes and base acts. Shiqu is still the writing of a literati, unable to understand the actor Li Liweng.</p>
<p>Although Wu Bing (Shiqu) has many oblique words and delicate phrases, he is not unworthy of being a literati's writing. In Li Yu (Liweng)'s ten operas, all kinds of nasty words can be said, simply like an actor. From these few words, it can be seen that Ling does not like Li Yu, even more than Wu Bing.</p>
<p>Lou Dong labored to transform Wu Yu, Liang Fu's new sound is not as good as jade.</p>
<p>Who yearns for the stone drums of Qiyang, the world strives to imitate the calligraphy for exchanging geese.</p>
<p>During the Jiajing period, Wei Liangfu of Dongguan, Taicang (Lou Dong) improved Kunqu, making it extremely melodious, "The number of fast and slow, high and low, clear and turbid, all follow the original palace, taking words between the teeth and lips, repeatedly changing and skillfully picking, often using depth and remoteness to help its sadness," Because of his success, it is like Wang Xizhi's calligraphy that can exchange geese; therefore, everyone followed the trend, and the Haiyan Yiyang and other tunes of that time were defeated, and no one yearned for the stone drums carved by Shi Zhou during the time of King Xuan of Zhou. Everyone used Kunqu to sing legends and zaju operas.</p>
<p>A single word of contemplation is not easy to settle, the layers of meaning here are difficult for people to understand.</p>
<p>Try to create a new and different zaju opera, do not treat it as a poem or ci poem.</p>
<p>"Contemplating a single word, twisting off several whiskers." Although it is a genuine zaju opera, looking at it after it is written, it seems effortless; I am afraid that it also took a lot of effort in production to have this natural result, right? It is successful to put in effort and not be seen by others. Opera has a separate meaning from poetry and ci poems: this point is what Ling pays great attention to.</p>
<p>The language and energy must be authentic, it is different and new compared to poetry.</p>
<p>Extract the gold-like sentences of Jin Zhi,</p>
<p>Shake off the black spirit in the wind.</p>
<p>The original note says: "Shaking off the black spirit, scattering the yellow whiskers, Kang Jinzhi's Black Whirlwind carrying thorns is exactly the tune," Calling spirit black is indeed very novel. According to this, these two sentences are seen in Kang Jinzhi's "Li Da of Liangshanbo Carrying Thorns" in the second act.</p>
<p>Half a window of bright moon, the fifth watch wind.</p>
<p>Tianbao fragrant words, the sentences are pretentious.</p>
<p>What is the matter with the beautiful ending of five-character verses?</p>
<p>Do not teach to move to the late Tang dynasty.</p>
<p>The original note says: "Wang Bocheng's Tianbao Anecdotes; Half a window of a thousand miles of moon, a pillow of the fifth watch wind: like a poem of a late Tang person, it is not similar to the opera ending." I have compiled more than fifty sets of "Tianbao Anecdotes" from Yongxi Yuefu, Jiugong Dachengpu Beici Guangzhengpu, Beigong Ciji, etc. These two sentences are seen in Yongxi Yuefu Volume Four Dian Jiangchun Suite, entitled "Emperor Ming's Lamenting Ye Jing", the first sentence is "The world is clear". This song also says that poetry, ci poetry, and opera each have their own boundaries, and cannot be mixed.</p>
<p>The previous tune was not originally this last section.</p>
<p>Who taught the north and south to be transmitted in the same way?</p>
<p>If you compare the sheng and reed instruments to the stringed instruments,</p>
<p>Dongjia's good ci poem is ultimately in vain.</p>
<p>Ling is a worshiper of northern opera, so this song says that the north is superior to the south. If the numbers of tunes are the same, then below the second tune, southern opera is called the previous tune, and northern opera is called the last section. Southern opera's instruments use sheng and reed instruments, but northern opera's instruments use stringed instruments. No matter how good Gao Ming (Dongjia)'s southern opera Pipa Ji is, it is not as good as the northern opera. There is an essay on northern and southern opera in the Xiaolitang Wenji, but I have not been able to read it carefully in a hurry.</p>
<p>How many people read the harmonizing sound production manual?</p>
<p>Xu and Shen diverged on the discussion of north and south.</p>
<p>Bai Jie's cloud section is completely indistinguishable,</p>
<p>It is said to be widely transmitted in Yu Shi and Ning An.</p>
<p>Xu Yu's Shi has a northern opera manual, but I have not seen it. I have only seen the Jiugong Zhengshi, which seems to be related to Xu Yu's Shi, but this is a southern opera manual. Shen Jing (Ning An)'s southern Jiugong Thirteen Tune Manual has a stone print version from Peking University, which is easier to obtain. Shen Jing has written Yixia Ji (Sixty Kinds of Opera Books), Boxiao Ji (Three Kinds of Legends), Maijian Ji (Beijing Library Edition), and Taofu Ji (Fine Copy Edition), paying close attention to Bai Jie's cloud section. Saying that he is gaining fame in vain seems inappropriate.</p>
<p>Jikong used the three sounds to arrange the southern sound,</p>
<p>Sao Yin and Wu Sao also have feelings.</p>
<p>Furthermore, meticulously arranging the opera comments,</p>
<p>Envy him, Yu Lansheng of the East Sea.</p>
<p>This song has no deep meaning, it just points out some opera selections and opera reviews: Ling Chucheng (i.e., Jikong Guan Zhuren)'s "Southern Sound Three Sounds", Sao Yinsheng's "Wu Sao Compilation", and Lu Tiancheng (Yu Lansheng) of the East Sea's "Opera Comments". Could Sao Yinsheng be another name for Zhang Xuchu? Because the "Author's Occasional Comments" at the beginning of "Wu Sao Compilation" can be said to be completely the same as Sao Yinsheng's "Heng Qu Qing Tan" in the supplemented Qu Yuan Shang.</p>
<p>The five sounds of clear and turbid are difficult to distinguish,</p>
<p>Go up and down, Yin and Yang, examine diligently.</p>
<p>The rhyme was established by Liu Kun that day,</p>
<p>Zhou Lang was annoyed by Shen Xiuwen.</p>
<p>The original note says: "Zhou Tingzhai's Zhongyuan Yin Yun also mistakenly took Guang Yun as Shen Yun." According to this, "Guang Yun" was compiled by Lu Fayan of the Sui Dynasty. Sun Mian of the Tang Dynasty revised it into "Tang Yun", and Chen Pengnian and Qiu Yong of the Song Dynasty revised it into "Great Song Restored Guang Yun".</p>
<h3>Tears</h3>
<p>— Jing Chen</p>
<p>The night is desolate. Facing the boundless loneliness, I suddenly remembered Verlaine's words: "When I think of the past, I want to cry." Silently asking myself: Did I ever have a past that I could cry about? How many times have I wept silently like a ghost in the past?</p>
<p>Alas—these are some unspeakable facts that are chewing on my fragile soul!</p>
<p>In this vast world, is there anyone willing to understand me? I have walked the edge of people's hearts, but I cannot find the source of life. Where is the spring?</p>
<p>"Keep fighting, why must people understand you?" Yes, this kind of glory belongs to those who have perseverance, but I weep for this.</p>
<p>I am not cold, and I do not lack the flames of love. I still have a passionate and pure heart. I am willing to dedicate all of these to one person. However, who will sincerely accept it? To whom shall I dedicate all my love?</p>
<p>"Being able to experience sorrow, this life is also happy." If there is such a thing, I am willing to dry my tears.</p>
<p>But, tears! Flow freely!</p>
<p>If the warmth of spring is lost, will it come again? I remember Mr. Ba Nan Yoxi once said: "Spring will come! There are countless beautiful springs." Is that really so? Could it be that what comes will be more than what is lost?</p>
<p>I am like a saintly virgin, who does not expect the warmth of love. However, when spring touches her heart several times, when she yearns for that beautiful temptation and cannot help but reach out to embrace it, hope quietly slips away, leaving her with eternal solitude. Oh, that unbearable solitude! Her young, fragile heart is crying.</p>
<p>Tears are not necessarily a sign of weakness, because strong people shed strong tears. "Tears will make me stronger," tears also bring the power to fight. The weak fall down with tears, while the strong stand up with tears.</p>
<p>"Wipe away your tears, even if it is painful, you must endure it, because this is not the time to cry."</p>
<p>The days of fighting have come, so wipe them away.</p>
<h3>A Happy Encounter with Lu Mang on the Sea in the Twelfth Lunar Month of Yiyou</h3>
<p>— Xu Junwu</p>
<p>At the end of the year, the fragrant streets are in a blur. Meeting each other, holding hands, is so sudden. The heroes of the renaissance share three cups of wine. The remaining affair of writing is like a rainbow of ten thousand feet. I can't bear to talk about saving the poor and competing with vigorous pens. Gradually seeing the wandering official lose his lonely trace. Tomorrow, cut off half of the Song River for you. To sing a song about Dong Yue.</p>
<h3>Meeting Junwu Again and Invited to a Drink in a Restaurant on the Sea, Composed on the Spot</h3>
<p>— Lu Mang</p>
<p>The first among poets of lakes and seas, his life is full of heroic righteousness and autumnal spirit. The reputation of his family is heavy in the land of orchids. The articles of pearl and jade are respected by the scholars of the country. How can unicorns and phoenixes perch on thorny bushes? It is good to be romantic with unicorns and phoenixes. Your ability must be cherished in the bright era. Learn from Zhang Heng's "Four Sorrows".</p>
<h3>Recommendation of the "Yu Kai Collection of New Year Card Exhibition"</h3>
<p>— Wen Zhaotong</p>
<p>If we acknowledge that the scope of art is not limited to calligraphy, painting, and music, then the collection and preservation of items with artistic interest is also a kind of artistic activity.</p>
<p>As for the subtle stamps of various countries and dynasties, they can not only be used to observe the evolution of the history, economy, and politics of various countries and times, but also each stamp can express the artistic style of a country and an era in terms of color and pattern. Therefore, we must not regard the collection of stamps as a way of playing with antiques or a job of finding popular bases, but simply as a kind of artistic activity.</p>
<p>Yu Kai's collection of international New Year's cards and postcards has reached 80,000 pieces, which is amazing in terms of quantity alone. Moreover, here we can appreciate the differences in aesthetic concepts between the East and the West, the great differences in artistic forms, the classical taste, the modern style, and so on. All of this is simply a sign of the development of art in China and abroad, ancient and modern. In the eyes of the appreciator, it must not be regarded as a meaningless accumulation of New Year's cards or postcards, because this is a kind of artistic activity.</p>
<p>Art is not necessarily calligraphy, painting, or music. In our living surroundings, there are many works of art that can be discovered, organized, appreciated, and researched. Yu Kai is an artistic worker walking on this "road station". Friends who love art should pay attention to this exhibition of his international New Year's card postcards.</p>
<h3>The Lute Player</h3>
<p>— Bi Xichang</p>
<p>As the moon rises at dusk, I idly lean against the railing of a small building's corner. The "ding dong, ding dong" sounds of a stringed instrument gradually approach from afar, the weak tones slowly growing stronger, piercing my ethereal spirit. A shadowy figure quietly appears on the desolate street. It is a frail old man, embracing a seven-stringed lute, leisurely and freely playing melodies that no one appreciates. The desolate music seems to be pouring out his own adrift life and the vicissitudes of the world...</p>
<p>He slowly walks under the street lamp, the dim and powerless light ultimately unable to conceal his haggard face.</p>
<p>White hair flutters at his temples, and wrinkles cover his face; this must be the price of youth, this must be the record given by the era.</p>
<p>I linger and ponder, adding to my boundless melancholy.</p>
<p>The desolate sound of the lute does not pause for me and finally fades into the darkness.</p>
<p>Only the lingering sound deeply grips my heartstrings.</p>
<p>Ah! Lute player, on this vast land, where can you find your soulmate?</p>
<p>Spring and Autumn Annals</p>
<h3>The "Atomic Age"</h3>
<p>— Xie Dongping</p>
<p>Human wisdom has deeply etched a mark in time: now is the age of the atom.</p>
<p>Only the Japanese have experienced the power of the atomic bomb. Afterwards, where will that thing, atomic energy, ultimately be used: to enhance human culture, or to destroy it? No one can provide assurance.</p>
<p>Now, we must thank the atomic bomb, thank the courage and great wisdom of those who invented and applied it. Its light use at least caused the enemy's unconditional surrender to be advanced by a year. How many lives could this have saved, how much material could this have spared?</p>
<p>Some say that China is now facing a time when the pen and the gun are contending. A member participating in the Political Consultative Conference said: "In history, when the pen and the gun contend, the pen always wins." This is perhaps because people are ultimately people, they have wisdom and reason, and can be self-aware. If people were cats and dogs, then when the pen and the gun contend, the pen would certainly be defeated. The pen's victory is assured, but in order to advance the victory, in order to reduce the sacrifices and consumption of the "contention", I advocate that those who use the pen also make use of atomic energy. If the "pen" represents light and truth, and the gun represents darkness and evil, then why can't we use atomic bombs to attack darkness and evil?</p>
<p>The era of "cold shots" on the battlefield has passed; the era in the literary world of sneaking around, vaguely hinting, and casting veiled allusions, without daring to write openly, has also passed.</p>
<p>How can you eliminate the corrupt officials, the great traitors and evil-doers in society, and the bad habits inside and out of thousands of years of bad tradition without using atomic bombs?</p>
<p>In the atomic age, atomic bombs must be used. This is a matter of course.</p>
<h3>Doubly Blessed (9) (4)</h3>
<p>— Zhao Qingge</p>
<p>After struggling through a life-or-death ordeal, Mrs. Mo has now safely recovered her tranquility. She snuggles the little baby close to her side, feeling a special warmth. For four years, her life has been so dull that she has often felt bored. She has long needed a new child to fill a part of the emptiness in her heart! Especially she hopes to have a daughter. Now everything is fine, and she is completely satisfied that her wish has come true!</p>
<p>Mrs. Weng the Second is busy arranging the baby's diapers and clothes. Mrs. Mo feels very sorry and gratefully says to her:</p>
<p>"You should rest, my good sister! Be careful not to exhaust yourself; it's not convenient for you either!"</p>
<p>"It's alright, sister! I still have a long time to go!" Mrs. Weng the Second said, her face blushing.</p>
<p>Mrs. Weng the Second was indeed pregnant, because this was her first pregnancy, so she only let Mrs. Mo know and didn't even tell Mr. Weng. But eventually she couldn't hide it from Mr. Weng, who had seen it long ago.</p>
<p>Mrs. Mo saw that Mrs. Weng the Second was a little shy and asked her:</p>
<p>"Doesn't Mr. Weng know yet? Tell him quickly, tell him, so he can take care of you."</p>
<p>"Take care of me?" Mrs. Weng the Second said with a cold laugh, "He's busy enough taking care of his opium all day long, how can he have time to take care of me?"</p>
<p>"Hey! Men are all the same! Our old master here only knows how to drink all day long! Didn't you see, we've been busy here for most of the day, and we haven't even seen a ghost of a lamp yet!"</p>
<p>Just as she said this, Bao Ling burst in. He had already heard them grumbling about Old Master Mo again, so he deliberately interrupted their conversation.</p>
<p>"Mom! Let me see my little sister!" Bao Ling said, throwing himself on the baby and shouting innocently, "Little sister! Little sister!"</p>
<p>"Don't scare her, Bao Ling!" Mrs. Mo said. "Go and pour a cup of tea for your dad!"</p>
<p>"Dad? Dad is outside! He also came to see little sister!" Bao Ling deliberately interrupted.</p>
<p>"You little rascal! I told you to pour a cup of tea for your godfather, why don't you understand!" Mrs. Mo scolded.</p>
<p>In fact, Bao Ling had understood. The child was naughty, he had already understood that the "dad" Mrs. Mo was referring to was not Old Master Mo, he was just intentionally denying this term and pretending not to understand. It was Mrs. Mo who didn't understand his intention. Now that Mrs. Mo was forced to add the word "god", Bao Ling was finally convinced. So he smiled victoriously and said to Mrs. Weng the Second:</p>
<p>"Godfather, please wait a moment, I'll go and make you some tea."</p>
<p>After Bao Ling left, Mrs. Weng the Second said with a smile:</p>
<p>"Bao Ling is growing more and more like his father! Not only does he look like him, but even his spirit is like him."</p>
<p>"That's why I don't like Bao Ling very much! Who knows, I hate that dead old man so much."</p>
