<h3 id="c1">國軍昨晨克四平街　承德以東共軍被阻　瀋陽長春局勢有新轉變 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>〔本報瀋腸十九日電〕四平街已在國軍一月來逐步推進中，於十九日晨八時收復，瀋陽長春間局勢，又有一新轉變。消息傳抵潘腸，各報紛出號外，激起人民一種新觀念，僞滿四平設市，市區面積二十萬三千六百零六平方公里，人口的六萬餘，鐵路四達，東通朝鮮，西扼蒙古門戶，南北有中長鐵路貫通，加以該省農產豐富，致造成四平市幾爲東北南部第一農產市塲，出產以豆類爲多，同時亦爲一大油化工業地，油坊林立，另有麵粉造酒洋灰等廠，四平實一交通工業經濟中心重地也。</p>
<p>〔合衆社南京十九日電〕據此間報紙消息：國軍向四平街區之共產軍左翼陣地側擊成功，業已迫近該城西北之梨樹，目下正爲爭奪該城東北之山頭，而進行激戰中。</p>
<p>〔法新聞社南京十八日電〕政府軍某發言人本日談及東北局勢時，對於政府軍來日將向四平街採取攻勢之說，未能加以證實；但默認政府軍繼續進攻該城，並猛列加以轟擊。同時中共發言人堅稱：四平街仍在堅守中。政府軍精銳冬師所作努力，均歸無效。該發言人證實城中房屋數百幢已被轟毀，平民損失市大，但林彪將軍部下中共軍，決意堅守到底。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十九日電〕晚消息，自熱河赤峯東進之共軍，已在承德以東爲精銳國軍阻遏，共軍正自冀察兩省抽調軍隊，向熱河增援，共軍之目的　欲挽回東北四平街本溪之頽勢，但爲時已不及。又遼北國軍克復西　後，兩翼均有進展，東北國軍之士氣甚旺，聞白崇禧孫立人至前綫視察時，對國軍之紀律甚表滿意，因白孫二將軍至東北之任務，不使如共軍所謂「國軍將發動總攻」，因渠等至東北之主要任務，爲考騐軍隊敎育在東北發生之效果。過去兩週共軍，曾以種種方法，向國軍展開神經戰，所用廣播及以飛機散播傳單之方法，則一如曾爲德國利用之哈哈爵士然，但忠勇之國軍，毫不爲動，因東北之國軍，已認淸渠等收復長春之目的，爲收回國家主權，有敢加以阻撓者，即爲國賊，長春收為國有，南京一切商談，始有合法合理之解決。</p>
<h3 id="c2">膠濟綫共軍廣泛出擊　調大軍進攻濟南　其用意在迫使政府再作一次讓步　共軍陷明永車站城鎭在國軍手中 <a href="#c2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>〔本報濟南十九日電〕根據近來各種跡象，判斷共軍顯巳採取逐步圍困濟南之策略。一般軍事觀察家的意見，認爲共軍連日在膠濟綫上廣泛的出擊，尙不能視爲即將進行正式內戰的先聲。共軍之目的，仍係騷擾性質，藉以加强共黨代表在軍事調處談判上的聲勢，企圖政府做再一次讓步。惟共軍積極準備內戰，則屬事實。</p>
<p>〔本報濟南十八日電〕明水車站被共軍攻佔，明水鎭尙大部在國軍手中。共軍　夜猛攻，僅佔一隅。十八日該鎭激烈巷戰竟日，濟小組十八日往調處，抵郭店後，因路軌橋樑破壞，不能前進，政府代表正商洽徒步前行調査眞象。十八日濟市煤糧陡漲，何思源即飛京。</p>
<p>〔本報靑島十八日電〕濟南以東膠濟綫上共軍之廣泛出擊，聞係有計劃之行動，共軍刻仍在陸續調動大軍，揚言即將進攻濟南。</p>
<p>〔本報濟南十八日電〕共軍十七日夜起，在濟南市南鄕仲宮堡十餘村大肆屠殺，壯丁無一幸免，甚有全家被害者，慘極人寰。濟南小組由郭店徒步東行十餘里，至市家莊晤共軍營長，因共軍無負責人，當由政府代表文澤等擬定速停衝突，修復交通，交還俘虜槍械四項辦法，交該營長轉廖容林，十八日晚，返抵濟南，定二十日飛臨沂晤陳毅，商整個解決辦法。綏署及魯省府亦派員同往。</p>
<p>〔本報靑島十八日電〕濟南以東沿膠濟綫上各地之戰事，刻仍在繼續進行中，濟南執行小組，即日前往衝突地帶，準備調處。</p>
<p>〔合衆社青島十八日電〕據美陸戰隊第三旅司令部方面稱：山東省共產軍之實力與國軍相較，爲二與一之比，苟共軍決定行動，可能在一個月內佔領全省。據稱：山東省內共產軍有武裝優秀之部隊三十萬人，而國軍僅有十五萬人。克里門準將吿合衆社記者謂：彼相信共產軍已將軍隊　入全省極有利之地點，可以爲所欲爲。渠稱：山東局勢胥視馬歇爾將軍之談判結果而定。</p>
<p>〔本報濟南十八日電〕高唐縣境朱莊防地十五日起，遭受共軍四千餘猛烈圍攻，迄今三天，內外交通斷絕，守軍浴血抗戰，傷亡慘重，現已糧盡彈絕，縣長鄧協忱電請當局制止或應援，以解危急。</p>

<p>〔中央社濟南十八日電〕津浦區鐵路局運輸救濟物資之汽車隊汽車十四輛，由高密載運救濟麵粉三十噸抵張店後，因連日陰雨，停留張店，於十六日返高密，搭載遺送回國日僑五百名，行至益都，被共軍將全部車輛及司機助手等扣留，救濟分署及路局押運人員，均被驅回張店。</p>
<h3 id="c3">平津甚緊張　共軍開入門頭溝 <a href="#c3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>〔合衆社北平十九日電〕今日因聞共軍已開人北平西方十七哩之門頭溝，故城內情形，殊見緊張，各軍事設備之外，已堆積沙袋。某高級政府官吏曾撫慰民衆，聲稱不必恐慌，但入夜之後，警察即將內城門關閉，査問路人，搜査旅館，並在重要地點，增加崗位。</p>
<p>〔合衆社天津十九日電〕在保安隊克復柳安莊公佈聲中，天津市民今日首次在大公報上，獲悉共軍或非正規軍離津僅五哩之消息。又悉：天津西方及西北角十五至廿哩處之若干地點，已自共軍手中奪回。</p>
<p>〔本報北平十九日電〕保定東方之劉家口，於昨夜被數的六百餘之共軍襲擊，激戰二小時後，共軍不支退去。國軍追擊，中途發現可疑之新墳，由內掘出地雷二百餘枚。又保定南方之朱家莊，今晨零時被共軍襲，因寡衆不敵，軍國被俘數十人，現尙被圍攻中，同時該方面之電綫，多被破壞。</p>
<h3 id="c4">高嶺站收復　鐵路搶修中 <a href="#c4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>

<h3 id="c5">宣化店停戰命令　已簽字送令遵行 <a href="#c5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>〔本報北平十九日電〕軍調部第三十二執行小組，十二日曾在宣化店召開會議，議決宣字第一號命令，稱；「據報有軍隊調動及軍事衝突情事，此等情事，據報在河口與黃陂以西以南之大成澤楊家河江母岩一帶，在本小組未調査軍事衝突前，所有軍隊應立即停止開火，並撤至本年一月二十三日「羅山協議之日」以前之位置，此命令到達特，立即生效，此令。　上項命令已經三方代表簽字，並分別送達該地國共兩軍司令部。又該小組十七日上午已到黃陂黃安以南地區視察後，乘宜漢路專車抵姚家集。此行除視察外，並監督上項命令之執行，並將繼續赴麻城小界嶺一帶視察。</p>
<h3 id="c6">瀋糧食來源被阻　饒漱石對遣石俘不感興趣 <a href="#c6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>〔本報瀋陽十七日電〕東北問題沉悶中，瀋陽等城市人民，因糧米來源被阻，糧米缺乏，物價高漲，大感煩惱。三人小組工作陷於停頓狀態中已久，軍調處美方潘林中校，十七日赴四平街轉長春共方商洽，遺送現在共軍所在區域中日僑俘問題，記者特叩詢三人小組共方饒漱石組長對此事之意見。據饒表示，關於此項問題，不感興趣，原因在於共軍所在區域日俘已被運走，至日僑可暫停定對付政策，目前較這送日僑更大的問題尙未進行，此舉係屬捨本求末。又謂遺送東北日僑，並不甚難，將來可送往朝鮮　國，便捷多多。至於開放糧源，只要有好的辦法，亦可不成問題。</p>
<h3 id="c7">共軍發動總攻擊　馬歇爾和努力大受威脅 <a href="#c7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>〔本報南京十九日專電〕據接近政府與中共兩方代表之中立人士談：依據目前之情勢觀察，解決當前危局唯一有效之辦法，厥爲停戰，若以邊打邊談之方法消弭爭端，則無異緣木求魚，吾人對於即將舉行之綜合小組會議，應認淸其時代使命，寄予厚望，因此一小組會議將就國大代表名額，改組政府，憲草審議三項重要課題，開誠協商，成立公允合理之決議，俾早日召開國民代表大會，議定憲法，改組政府，以達成團結統一之目的，重建民國而開萬世之太平基業，但欲望綜合小組會議進行順利結果圓滿，首須將全國無悄之戰火迅予撲滅，因戰塲之火藥氣味透入議塲後，足以刺激任何一方，弄成僵局。根據過去一週之種種跡象，硏究此點，馬歇爾特使似早已考慮周詳，將運用其卓越智慧，促成「軍事調處」「政治協商」兩大工作，平行進展，期使已燃之烽火勿再燎原。以過去經騐言，「軍事調處」之成就，希望甚微，設以目前東北熱河及華北複雜之現狀，而遽加判斷，則希望允微，然馬使不憚詞費，爲調處而努力不懈，可見幕後新聞已明示馬使之工作確信至失敗之境，且信綜合小組會議舉行時，局勢即有重大發展。</p>

<h3 id="c42">請新市長抑平米價！ <a href="#c42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>上海市的新市長，吳國楨氏今犬視事了。我們歡迎新市長，同時我們也期望新市長！</p>
<p>今天上海市民最感威脅的是物價高，工潮盛，而米價之飛漲尤爲此中最要的關鍵。吳市長上任，第一件大事就是要抑平米價。這是解決一切問題的中心問題。吳市長說，他只知爲市民切實辦事，不尙空口宣傳。我們歡迎他這句話，我們尤其期望他爲市民首先辦好道件「抑平米價」的大事。</p>
<p>這幾天米價的狂漲，倐忽間突破六萬大關，不僅使升斗小民，驚心怵目，全上海的市民沒有一個不面臨挨餓的威脅。「民以食爲天，米價是一切物價的準則；米價狂漲，必然是形成社會騷動的最大因素。米價的狂漲，固可藉口於糧荒，但是太市存底未必銳减，何以連天如此在漲？此中人爲的因素，一定佔着極大的成分。可惜市政當局，因爲交替在即，對於米市塲的興風作浪，大踢皮球，只有袖手旁觀，米蠧乃乘機作祟，老百姓還有什麽話可說！</p>
<p>我們研究這次米價狂泓的原因，純係人爲造成的恐慌。上海本是游資充斥的都市，因爲民族工業的枯竭，無法抬頭，致使游資沒有正當出路，在社會上造孽，巳非一日。風傳最近更有少數巨　組織買米多頭公司，在市塲上搜括食米棧單，故意抬價；又說別有政治作用之徒，也把敲剝來的法幣，在江南擾亂米市。這些人和投機米商一樣心腸，惟恐米價不漲，眞可謂「死有餘辜」。他們過去欺侮當局的軟弱，一再掉他們的槍花。初則謂上海存米稀少，請求貸款購糧。繼則糧貸發放而價反高，乃又歸咎於糧貸作祟，脅迫當局停止貸款購糧。最後乃乘市府改組，爭購棧單，大抬其價。這完全是故意和政府開玩笑，和小民作對敵。新市長應該對這些社會的巨蠧來個「下馬成」！</p>
<p>據糧食專家的調查與統計，上海食米的存底還相當充足，儲存在米行和堆棧中的食米，爲數不少，足够目前所需。如果沒有喪心病狂的什麽多頭公司，囤積居奇，從中作怪，則在目前決不會發生恐慌，引起米價的狂漲。所以，除了請市長嚴懲米蠧外，我們還要　請人民，沈着應付，切勿慌張，大家爭購食米，再去「火上添油」，使米價狂漲不已。同時，我們更要請求市政當局，立即調査全市米行及倉棧所有食米的總量，限期登記，以便從嚴管制，實行「計口授糧」。然後再本着吳市長過去辦理外交的經騐，竭力與聯總及英美暹羅越南各方交涉，必須大量輸入洋米，以解救中國的糧荒。</p>
<h3 id="c43">日本的吉田內閣 <a href="#c43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>體弱難產的日本吉田新內閣，經過幾天的陣痛，或可望於日內誕生。截至本文發表時，閣員名單尙未發表；業已決定的，除首相吉田自兼外相而外，尙祇有大藏省石橋湛三，司法省岩田宙造，運輸省平　常次郞，國務大臣幣原喜重郞·齋藤隆夫。與植原悅二郞三人；其餘閣員人選尙在接洽之中。觀其陣容，大半爲日本的保守份子，簡直可以說是幣原內閣的延長，已引起日本左翼各黨各派的不滿；即在我國輿論界，也一致認爲吉田內閣即使誕生出來，未必能長命。</p>
<p>我們觀察今日的日木政治，切不可忘懷日本是第二次世界大戰的罪魁禍首，應負荼毒人類的重大罪責。在戰後的今日，　國對待日本，固不必採取報復政策，作嚴峻的懲處，但必須切實管制，務使其侵略勢力不能死灰復燃，又成爲世界和平的威脅。民主國家爲使戰後的世界能步入和平民主的時代，一致公認，非從改造日本的政治做起不可。但是，今日的日本政治，離開我們所抱的理想及預定的目標，不知距離有數千萬里呢</p>
<p>第一，日本人民，雖然經過這一次的屈膝投降，並接受盟國的共同管制，但是在他們的內心，依然不承認自己是戰敗國，而且野心未死以爲只要假以時日，就可以捲土重來，這種心理是非常普遍的。同時日本人民的頑固思想，並不因這次戰敗而有所更改，侵略思想與軍國主義的遺毒，在日本人民的腦袋裘，幾乎根深蒂固。尤其是那些少壯派，還溫着「八紘一宇」的舊夢，執迷不悟，認為戰敗是暫時的，管制是表面的，不久就有東山再起的可能。上月初句，居然有日本的「愛國志士」，在地下從事秘密工作，對盟軍作有組織的破壞行動。更足以說明盟國改造日本肅淸侵略思想的工作，並沒有奏效。</p>
<p>第二，日本的政治，還沒有眞正走上民主化的途徑。日太軍閥所以能不顧民意的背向而悍然發動侵略戰爭，其根本原因，乃在日本政治的不民主，政權被操縱在少數軍閥官僚資本家的手裏。在其外表，雖具有英美式的議會政治的雛形，但在實質上，完全是反民主的法西斯政權，統治者可以獨斷獨行，不必徴求民意的向背。戰後盟國管制日本，固在使日本政治走上民主化的大道，可是九個月來，日木政治是否已走上這條大道？這固然不可貿然而下斷語，但觀於本年四月中旬日木總選的結果，在日本議會中自由黨佔議席一三九席，社會民主黨九三席，進步黨九一席，協和黨十六席，共產黨五席，無黨無派八四席，使我們不得不大失所望。因爲我們知道，所謂自由黨也者，就是政友會的替身，而進步黨又是民政黨的替身。這兩大政黨在近百年來的日本政治舞台上，一直是輪流扮演主角的，論理對於這次大戰，都應該負極大的責任。但是在戰後的日太政治，仍讓他們佔着極重要的地位，換湯不換藥，僅換一個招牌，如何能希望日本政治走上民主化的正軌？</p>
<p>總選揭曉之後，幣原內閣早應該下台，讓自由黨的黨魁鳩山一郞繼起組閣，無如鳩山被黜，不但想做首相的迷夢未能實現，反而把自由黨的黨魁也丟了。政局動盪，後繼無人，但是幣原遲早必將下台，最後才想出一個借屍還魂的辦法，便是發掘新人物，暗中聯絡吉田，主張自由黨與進步黨合併，由吉田組閣，自己仍在幕後牽綫，指揮一切。他的辦法，雖然獲得麥帥的同意，但是充滿了保守色彩的兩黨組織聯合內閣，不僅先天不足，產生艱難，即使不致流產，亦必因後天失調，不能持久。吉田內閣所遭遇的嚴重問題，不一而足，最主要的，有下列各項：</p>
<p>（一）人民的反對。目下日本人民沒有一個不認爲吉田內閣是幣原內閣的延長，已一致表示反對；尤其是社會民主黨，決與保守派鬥爭到底。吉田內閣對於民主陣綫的反對，自不能等閑視之。</p>
<p>（二）糧荒問題的嚴重。日本當前的危機，莫過於日趨嚴重的糧荒問題。假定吉田內閣果能負得起這個重擔，使日本人民大家不受饑饉的威脅，則其前途尙有可爲。所以他對於農相人選，一再考慮，並會不惜三顧茅廬，堅請帝大敎授東畑精一博士擔任，但是巧婦不能爲「無米之炊」，堅辭不就。這一個問題，也就成爲吉田內閣難產的主因。</p>
<p>（三）憲法問題包括犬皇存廢問題在內。依照盟國管制日本的要旨，務使日本政治走上民主化的正軌，另訂新憲法，自不待言。但是日人對於犬皇的存廢問題，贊成反對，各佔半數。因此如何調處，始能獲得一個圓滿的解決，實爲一個非常困難的問題。</p>
<p>（四）自山黨與逖步黨的合作，是暫時的，並不是永久的。吉田內閣又怎樣能安居其位呢？何况支持這兩黨的後台，都已沒落了，三井三菱的財閥，也早已不存在了，將來經濟靠誰支持呢？</p>
<p>要而言之，吉田內閣先天不足，體弱難產，再加以當前的難題重重，很難有光明的前程的！</p>

<p>〔美國新聞處華盛頓十八日電〕美國務卿貝爾納斯今日自巴黎返美後，當即與杜魯門總統商談，歷二小時。貝氏迄未公開發表意見，惟謂渠將於廿日廣播演說，報吿外長會議經過。其他出席外長會議之美方代表團人員，亦已返美。惟助理國務卿杜恩尙逗留巴黎，以美方代表名義　續與巴黎他國未返國人員會商，先期於六月十五日四外長再度會晤前解決若干問題。康納利參議員返美後，當即召開一記者招待會，謂外長會議雖未能盡如人意，完滿結束，惟渠認爲此次會議已爲下次會議開一和的逐步解決之前路，外長會議之成就雖與吾人之希望仍有相當距離，惟其間不無進步，因而下次會議（六月十五日）再度討論和的問題時，當獲相當助益。康納利並稱：渠將於廿二日向參院報吿外長會議經過，同日參院外交委會（渠即爲外委會主席）亦將召開會議，聽取並討論渠之報吿，參議員范登堡亦擬於廿一日向國會報吿渠對外長會議感想。</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓十九日電〕貝爾納斯今日認外長會議對於和的問題之解決，不得謂爲完全失敗。另據若干方面消息：貝爾納斯或曾報吿總統，謂會議結果並不若表面之惡劣，美蘇英法四國對於歐洲各種和的，如能假以時日，從長計議，意見可趨一致。貝氏並不如上月廿三日首途赴巴黎時之悲觀。彼深覺當竭力及早結束歐洲方面戰爭遺下之情况，除德國外，各國佔領軍均應撤退，召開歐洲和平大會，不可過事延緩云。</p>

<p>蘇稱英美試行原子外交政策</p>
<p>〔路透社莫斯科十九日電〕莫洛托夫自巴黎參加四强外長會議歸來未及十二小時，「新時代雜誌」即發表措辭異揚強硬之論文七篇，社評一篇，抨擊英美之外交政策，指其使用「原子武力外交」，責英美代表團在國際會議中故意與蘇爲難，不肯接受蘇聯及小國可贊成之解決辦法，其中一篤，係署名泰金者所作，提出連串質問，指出美國之失業狂漸，及美政府要求軍事基地之野心，以證明英美民主之虛偽。另一署名　　托夫者之文，則指貝爾納斯與貝文在巴黎外長會議中之態度，並非以國際安全，持久和平，或保護小國利益爲前提。並謂：近月來英美外交，已放棄與他國平等合作，相互諒解之態度，而試行武力與原子外交之政策。</p>
<p>〔聯合社倫敦十八日電〕莫斯科電台今日廣播新時代報論文，指摘英美利用舊金山會議各項決議「專爲自身利益打算，」並以英美外交政策中正發現「危險的新趨向」促起注意。該報追述英美與蘇聯戰時存在之軍政合作，但稱國際反動力量對於尙未凝固之和平與安全之大厦，現正陰謀加以傾覆云。</p>
<p>英國各報論調完全歸咎於蘇</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社倫敦十八日電〕此間政界人士檢討四國外長會議休會後所引起之局勢，並不十分熱烈，但表示鎭靜，若輩認爲巴黎會議無異一次「足球賽」，結果各未中球，草草收塲，但可於本年六月十五日恢復舉行，任何參加之一方，均不失顏面。同時，英各報以外長會議之失敗完全歸咎於蘇聯，各報舉出種種理由，認爲蘇聯保特「强硬」態度，在此反蘇派報紙指摘蘇不過延宕時間，以便在東歐「鋼幕」背後完成蘇聯佔領區之組織。至於對蘇態度較爲　和各報，認爲蘇聯代表團對於盎格魯撤克遜國家對若干重大事件之重要性，估計太低。</p>
<p>蘇稱英美試行原子外交政策</p>
<p>〔美國新聞處舊金山十八日電〕美國各報最近紛紛撰文評論巴黎外長會議休會，大多數報紙以諸外交家對各項主要問題未能獲致協議，表示遺憾。唯紐約時報稱：此次會議因國務卿貝爾納斯之積極領導，始不致毫無結果而散。該報發表此項意見，所持理由，乃貝爾納斯力主諸外長應於六月十五日繼續商談。紐的世界電訊及史格利浦霍華特系報社論稱：英法美蘇四國外長旣未能取得協商，唯一公正辦法，乃四强應以起草條約之責任，交付實際參戰之廿一國辦理。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕我國著名經濟學家馬寅初博士，昨晨十時，應立信同學會之邀，在寗波同鄕會舉行來滬後首次公開演講。首由立信會計專校校長潘序倫作簡略介紹，繼即由馬氏於千餘聽衆然烈掌聲中發言，首謂中國向係採用單式簿記，自滯序倫提倡複式簿記以來，近已獲得成功，故潘氏實可謂爲中國會計學之鼻祖。繼謂後方生活情形，實與上海有天壤之別，四川地大而食品甚劣，公敎人員，均吃爛米。據馬氏所知，米商之舞弊方法有七十四種之多，其最駭人聽聞者，　　江運米商人，往往於米中滲入用死人骨頭碾成之粉末，再沃以水，米即池高，重量亦增。檢査者往往赤足至米上走動，如足底作　，則米中必有死人骨無疑。運米人祗須聞檢査者「脚癢」一語，即知舞弊已被揭穿。此項米糧，經淘洗後仍可供餐，然此等方法，恐非上海人所能想像也。　至於衣服，往往鄕下人多穿新衣，而公敎人員則吾，有若干處又無電燈，以桐油燈代之，烟多光小，看書寫字尤爲困難，然每思前方將士，困苦邊較後方爲深，則亦安之若　矣。</p>
<p>書藉之缺乏，亦爲州重大之困難。一部份書藉因防轟炸關係，庋　深深密，不能供衆閱讀。但後方員生，仍舊苦幹。馬氏以極慨歎之聲調稱：「如果我不要臉，生意何嘗不可做？」但仍坐觀市儈奸商發財者，蓋多難正可興邦，「士」爲社會上之先知先覺，決不能同流合污也。</p>
<p>馬氏繼稱：讀書有讀書之樂趣，我人應犧牲物質上之享受。上海在抗戰八年之中，道德上思想上均米有進步，「到處錢，錢，錢，錢，錢！」多數人均祗知一天到晚打算盤，殊不知人必須有「人格」，需要做一點事情，有一點成就，吾則一生勞勞，算什麽生活！人生若無高尙之目的，則此人已無足取。宗敎家　　造世界，實係「人造世界」。我等一方面要讀書，研究科學，另一方面應在道德及精神上亦造出文明，于此可見哲學之重要。我等應站在自己的地位上，盡力敎書，盡力讀書，為國家做事，須知在中國讀書實非容易，全國有百分之九十以上之國民皆係文盲也。</p>
<p>生活上，一面看看上海，一面看看鄕下，即可知我人在上海之生活，水準已遠在「鄕下人」之上，在鄕間，有時運糠亦不能吃到，不至平地，焉知高山！故曰學問要朝上看，生活要朝下看，求學是爲學問，天下大學問家，決無爲鈔票而求學者也。</p>

<p>逕啓者，閱貴報五月六日刋載諸尙一先生：「染織業之貨物稅與營業稅問題」一文，核與事實頗有出入，茲就本局有關部份略述如下：</p>
<p>原文謂：「…故單純織廠所產棉布之不應繳納出產稅，固無庸贅論，其自紡自織者，於其紡的成品部份，應納統稅，而於織的部份，則絕無負担統稅之理，亦爲天經地義之解釋，至於因自紡自織之故，爲便利稽征計，因而於棉布出廠時，始行課征，亦宜以每疋棉布之含紗量從價征課，不得併同織布工繳曁織布利潤計征……」，又調「……但據傳非單純織廠之稅局駐廠員，往往於該廠紡的部份征課棉紗統稅之餘，復就其織的部份，課征棉布出廠稅，姑無論其於法無據，即使謂爲嚴密稽征，不得不爾，准於棉布出廠完我之後，得申請退回棉紗統稅，但棉布出廠稅之數額，是否係依每疋棉布之實際含紗量從價計征，亦殊難言」，綜合前後所論，不外謂旣征棉紗出廠稅，又征棉紗織成品出廠稅，而織成品之課稅方法，是否就含紗份量計征，抑包括工繳利潤各項在內，亦成疑問，査棉紗爲出廠稅，一次課征以後，即通行全國，不再征稅，此爲貨物統稅條例所明定，故本局征收棉紗稅，均係派員駐各紗廠征收，從無再就織廠征收情事，其棉紗直接織成品則憑原棉紗完稅照或分運照，按可能產製成品數量，換領單純織廠棉紗直接織成品運照憑運，不再征收分文，並非旣征棉紗稅，又征棉布稅，其有就織成品征稅者，亦係純就該織成品所含紗支重量計征，工繳利潤等項，自不在計征之列，但此處所謂征收織成品統稅，係指本市收復時之織成品存貨而言，因該項存貨，無論敵僞時期，有無課征，概應認爲未稅貨品，一律補征，此爲部頒收復區稽征辦法槪要所規定，若棉紗已征出廠稅，在單純織廠運照未奉部令頒發，其織成品未能換領單純織廠運照以前，商人有急於運銷，自願以織成品重納統稅以求迅捷者，則於事後亦可持憑原棉紗完稅照申請退款，亦非一物重征，原文謂：「織廠爲圖出口便利計，往往又另納棉布出廠稅以應命」，殆係因此而生之誤會，至所謂分運單之問題，細繹語意，似指單純織廠運照一而言，蓋分運單（正確名詞爲分運照）從未廢止，其作用爲就原完稅照分運貨品或更改運達地點，例如原完稅照載明棉紗一百件，銷售本市或運銷廣州，現須以十件運銷漢口，十件運銷重慶，剩八十件仍銷售本市或廣州，則可將原完稅照請求如上之分運，此一辦法，行之已久，迄未廢除，可見原文所謂分運單，常係指單純織廠之運照，換言之，即通俗所稱「以紗單調布單者」是，此單純織廠運照，本局早已換發，商人殆未週知，故不免仍有誤會。</p>
<p>總之本局辦理稅務，悉遵定章，如有未盡善處，亦無不竭誠歡迎各界之批評指示，爰就諸尙一先生誤會各點，予以解釋，用正觀聽，尙希</p>

<h3 id="c137">杭州仲夏夜之夢 <a href="#c137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>— 十五日杭州通訊　林</p>
<p>臨到我去杭州時，遊春時令已過。蘇堤的「一株　　一株桃」不曾看到，西湖上的　　叢中，款乃聲也還未到時節。春夏之交，我看到杭州的真實相。</p>
<p>傳奇都市</p>
<p>杭州本是遊都，小小的城池坐落在山下永邊，古今中外，不知誘引了多少遊客，　在歷史上作為南宋　安的國都。已留下了可歌可泣的故事。為適應山水，白娘娘與許仙，唐伯虎與秋香，加上濟公活佛這三個傳奇，就值得傾聽不厭。地理上，杭州擁有西湖湖山，雪捲似的錢江早晚潮，那些水波山峯，溪澗，林木，廟舍，足够你流連三十天，也還不能遍至。到杭州，你立住了足，要遊山玩水，真是有的事。</p>
<p>住在杭州的人，因為生長在風景裏，不覺遊覽可貴。八年前，日冠入侵此風景區時，杭州人民曾老老小小普遍遊過杭市四郊山水，但那時大家提包携籠扶老抱幼，走出家園，雖有心思留戀家鄉山水，山水不留人，只好棄家流亡異地。到如今八年，杭州子弟遠赴外鄉而尚滯留未返者，還大有人在。</p>
<p>西湖遊艇</p>
<p>我們投宿於一個中等價錢的湖濱旅館中，牠與西湖飯店，蝶來飯店，滄州飯店，同是占一個濱湖的妤處。因此，在樓上用西湖水洗去征塵時，西湖就含波盈盈的襯着東北岸綠山背景，用飄搖的白蓬遊艇在呼喚你，八年來我一直中了中央社臨撤退時所拍電文：一湖山寂寞，遊艇全沉湖底」之毒，以為西湖沒有遊艇，都已在八年前撤退時沉入水底，這光景，正如到了上海驚訝於上海景况依然故我一般的頑固。</p>
<p>西湖遊艇，八年來新造者甚多。連同原有的舊艇共有三百五十隻，他的式樣已經統一，輕而扁，船頭尾形式一樣。般夫兩名，分坐頭尾搖槳，中段艙設對面沙發靠　。相對共坐四人，膝同放一小圓桌，上置茶其，落雨出日時，白布紅邊的平頂蓬撐起遮蓋，刮風時，圍帳包住你下半身，不礙視線，却為你擋風。這些遊艇一小時二千元，半日八千元，一日一萬三千元的取價，看來似昻貴，若與目前杭市食宿以及法幣實值計算，却並無「刨黃瓜兒」之嫌。船夫都是壯年男子。三百五十隻遊艇，落在旗下，（湖濱路一帶，杭州人稱為旗下，當年滿清旗人所居之地也。）泊在湖上者，每天不過五六十艘，實在說來，船夫們六天侯客，才能賣出一天勞力得到船資一萬三千元，湖上落花如雨，轉人　　，每日六分之一的遊艇都搖不出去，船夫們只好更寂寞的望着走客，連「要隻船玩玩」的叫喊聲也懶得喊出來了。</p>
<p>外强中乾</p>
<p>一個由仕而商，在杭州下水開國際電影院的經理，跟我在他的沙發客廳上，分析杭州外强中乾的原因。「仗打完了，國家得到勝利與面子，人民却空了。杭州本身就像山水廟宇，等着別地方的遊客來施捨，來花錢，本身却沒有繁榮自己的力量。別地方人，在兵荒馬亂之後，都各自去忙各自的生計，那有閑功夫與閑錢到這兒來花？加上交通不便，戰亂不已，除了上海的幾千大戶還能合家抽空來花筆錢之外，就沒有什麼客人來此問津。」</p>
<p>他的話說得非常入情入理。在杭州一週，我去游湖，是以六千元作三小時走馬式的快游。船夫希望我在所經之湖濱名勝，都能上去觀摩，我却毫不留戀的要他「划過去！」什麼「柳浪聞鶯」不要聽，什麼「雷峯夕照」的廢址不要看，蔣主席來杭下蹕處盛莊」不上去，我只要船夫划到湖心非船不能去的「三潭印月」以及湖心亭二處走了一下，我發現新有遊湖的人大多像我這般計算，一樣煞風景，有的甚至連三小時湖上都不肯留，只單程去一下三潭印月，就打馬回衙。</p>
<p>水邊茶座</p>
<p>在趕脚似的遊覽中，只有九溪十八澗的九溪茶場以及靈隱寺前，平湖秋月三處的茶座最能令遊客留戀不忍去。這三處都傍依了淙淙的水邊，茶座上的龍井綠葉新茶沏出的嫩綠色茶，呌遊客真正在吞下杭州山水。（龍井茶為杭州山上茶樹的嫩葉，開水為西湖水燒成。）儉省的遊客，一杯一杯把茶由綠汁吃成黃水，直至茶成白水，方始站起奇離去。</p>
<p>為了日夜朝暮看西子，我沒有慳吝到住於城站或城中的旅館，而在她身邊的湖濱樓上貪看着不同時分的不同顏色。我愛西子，因為這麼好的湖山自生自存，在我的凌亂一生中，她僅與我親近二次，每次為期短促，不滿七日。在四川七年中，我發誓回到故鄕江南，一定要與西湖為伴，我總算穿過千萬重山水見到了西湖，滿足了面對西湖的欲望。</p>
<p>閑話海塘</p>
<p>我犯了關心民生的毛病，歡喜　人家有關民生的事業。杭　中，抽空訪浙閩分署孫曉　　民，及其視察主任張中　氏談及浙江海塘修理情形如次：</p>
<p>浙海　分北塘與南塘兩部：北塘起自杭市，經海軍，海　，至平湖之乍浦鎮，接蘇省金山縣海塘止，計二百餘公里。由於海流及風向關係，錢江潮總是拍打北岸海塘。八年失修，北岸十一個缺口，有的僅一二丈寬，有的是一英里寬，以海軍縣境缺口最多。海　縣蝕蛀洞也不少，但尚未達成缺口規模。南岸僅　山紹興兩縣，短於北岸。平素僅受北岸擊回的江海潮沖激，受脅比北岸小。兩岸海塘，均係宋朝所築，當時土木工程的技術及築法，自屬有限，不曾想到千年後子孫們仍依靠祖先力量，做抗水保障，故歷年雖修理，也年年於湖水漲時塌陷，年年修理。這八年杭戰，日本人像對他所有占領區公共　　　　　　一樣，不　　　　　　陷的後果，因此，八年累積的毛病病，必須在今年八月十八日秋潮以前予以醫好。孫　　署長到杭接事後，曾去北岸海塘視察二次，南岸海塘亦去過。陳中　說：他的辦公　中那位年青壯健的美國梅工程師，是真正的海塘專家，他是專為此事由聯總調他由巴拿馬運河區來這個山水絕佳之地。</p>
<p>修塘成案</p>
<p>浙閩分署關於海塘已有成案在胸，在視察中已找出：（一）陷下處——立即予以小修，（二）缺口，南岸十一個，北岸十三個，予以大修。（三）如堅而可可被冲陷或造成缺口處——立即予以預修。</p>
<p>海塘工程，今年二月廿五日開始在缺口最多的海寧縣着手，由該縣朱議長主持，由浙閩分署供應了一百零五噸麵粉作工糧，二百萬元水泥作工料，全部大修工程，已於五月五日開始，預定秋汎前完成，經費六十萬萬元。浙省地方行政院及浙閩分署，各三分之一，惟分署所供應者為二十萬萬元工工料，如麵粉，水泥等，不會受法幣貶值物價上漲影響。另三分之二如為法幣，在時日進展中，定然免不了又要發生不够現象。</p>
<p>海塘為一種石塊及木柴所築的海堤。塘面寬六尺，最外邊一尺寬為石塊，靠裏二尺面上為石塊，下為木柴，最裏連三尺寬則用混礙土，故石塊雖堅，常被海潮由水底部沖拋至塘內，大如桌形石塊，在海潮巨掌中，實不里卵石耳。全部改造為混礙土海塘工程，耗費在幾百萬萬元以上，不是今年年內所可舉辦者，而欲保錢塘江及長江兩個三角洲上肥沃產米土地不為鹽質海水浸灌，這種巨大的築塘工程，又必需舉辦。在動亂之中，這些才是值得重視的。但如今人們的眼光及想法都不及此，日夕與這種業務為伴的人怎不心焦？孫曉樓署長担心產米區一旦灌了鹽水，土質三年至十年不能種稻，那後果將毀滅蘇杭天堂，造成一片新地獄！好在大修海塘缺口己可抵擋今年秋湖，來年事誰能預謀？我要請中樞執政及早着手舉辦。</p>

<p>— 南京十七日通訊　朱民威</p>
<p>駐防首都空軍，為有名的芷江第五大隊，刻下正在參與首都大演習中。一月前，第五大隊曾派機在京滬上空作低空表演飛行，其中超低空追擊一項節目，尤令觀眾心驚。彼時飛機距地在五丈左右，因P—51戰鬥機時速本大，故異常快速的在低空飛馳，所過處，屋瓦為之震撼。</p>

<p>第五大隊大隊長鄭松苧，為三大隊調來之宿將，副大隊長項世端，則為五大隊老戰士，彼八年來始終在五大隊，身經百戰，其經歷至足奇異。廿七年，彼以航校八期畢業入第五大隊為飛行員，即開始于役西北，遠至哈密。廿九年作戰成都，重慶上空。民卅一年馳援緬甸，駐防臘戌機場，掩護社聿明二百師裝甲部隊入援緬甸英軍抗日，曾于一次機損時迫降飄背（臘戌至仰光途中），駕細人牛車逃出敵區，返回我軍境內。旋隨軍退却入滇，以　15式三型海　　鬥機在滇西保山至八莫一綫，低空抵禦入侵之敵寇，殺敵甚多。此為我國戰鬥機低空攻擊敵地面戰鬥之復活。後美國援我，項世端隨隊往印度接受P—40戰鬥機之訓練，三次駕P—40機，由印度洋海濱卡拉齊經駝峯返國。與敵作戰。自民卅三年春天起，即駐防湖南芷江機場。彼以五七隊十七中隊隊長每日率領部眾出擊，遠至武漢，近如長沙、衡陽等地。</p>

<p>民卅年秋，在湘西戰爭中，某次空戰於擊落敵機後，亦受敵機圍擊，致背部中彈受傷。因彼體健，一經醫愈，即重上天空，進行戰鬥。彼於地面擊毀敵汽車輜重無數，炸斷橋樑，殲滅敵軍人馬，歷一年之久。民卅四年五月，敵復犯湘西芷江，在有名的雪峯山上空，項世端每日率隊隨大險長張唐天出擊敵陣，擊斃來犯之敵達八千人以上，乃有厥後之湘西大捷，敵軍自此潰敗。</p>

<p>彼自認為最滿意者，為三十四年六月，彼率第十七中隊飛越敵人所駐粵漢鐵路綫，進駐四面包圍下的茶陵機場。是役，他帶了八個能飛行員，六架P51式戰鬥機，茶陵機場跑道一千公尺長，P51式機剛可滿載起飛，是時敵軍已經每日由　州向南昌，以及由柳州·桂林向長沙岳陽撤進，他們在二條敵軍撤退綫之間起飛落地，專作炸射敵軍退却的汽車隊及木船隊工作，戰果收獲甚大。計打沉敵軍木船一百隻，汽車約百餘輛。是役美軍專任補給，以三架空運機運油彈及給養。茶陵雖為破舊鄉村，但在破屋牆上漆繪了S.M.S.O等標記，亦頗神氣。美軍常云：「我們是中美合作的空中游擊隊」。大家日常生活，因為在鄉野戰場，幾乎入於原始時代，手抓燒好的鷄腿啃吃之風盛行。機場附近有一綠色小河，作戰歸來，大家首先脫光衣服，在河中游泳取涼，恢復緊張的肢體。</p>

<h3 id="c143">項副大隊長世瑞　贛省府改組聲中一件驚人自殺案 <a href="#c143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>— 南昌十二日通訊　江昭然</p>
<p>江西省政府改組，是一個　時代大改組，就是　　　　格（委員　　　長　委員兼秘書長）的人來說：六個人當中，只有兩個人適任本　各職，其一便是委員兼田糧處長程懋型。程氏　省新建人，現年五十一歲，曾任川省專員，糧　　次長，於去年八月間回　，繼胡　詔氏出任省府委員兼田糧處長。程氏連任本兼各職，一般人都以為這是中央對於程倚　方殷的表示，而在程氏是該引為光榮的。詎料省府改組消息見報後二天（四月十日），程氏忽在吉安自殺了，緣程氏奉命於四月六日由省啟程，赴贛江沿岸各縣催購餘糧，督運存糧，因見沿途糧船奇缺，又據各地災眾陳述說在青黃不接，並無餘糧可供收購，同時，程氏經查各縣的存糧實額，都是寥寥無幾，比起報省的數字來，簡直有天壤之別。於是，程氏又憂又氣，難過到了極點。抵吉安後，便於十日下午二時許，以「散步」為托詞，只帶隨役一人，走到白鷺訓畔，趁隨役不覺之際，縱身入水，當時水深勢湍，等到隨役發覺，跳水施救，已經化做波臣了。程氏死前寫了一對遺書，死後被人尋出，大意是各方要糧，各縣又無糧，糧船也很少，事到如今，無法可想，只有自殺，以報國家，以謝人民。</p>
<p>程氏自殺消息傳遍南昌後，各方臆測頗多，但記者不應作何臆測。只在此說一句：這是一件驚人的目殺案！</p>
<p>自右至左：賴依，貝　納　，</p>
<h3 id="c144">世界的司閽人　聯合國機構秘書長賴依 <a href="#c144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>— 本報編譯室特譯</p>
<p>在聯合國機構成立之初，很多人對它表示依賴。等到安全理事會將近開會時，發生了幾件不幸的波折，這般人的信念不免因此動搖了。伊期問題就是一個緊急關頭，是聯合國機構必須設法克服的第一道難關。但是信念堅定的人們相信聯合國機構必能排除障礙而達到和平的坦途。其中一人，就是該機構秘書長賴依，是一位個性堅强，祟尚實際的挪威律師</p>
<h3 id="c145">絕對國際性不受任何影響 <a href="#c145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>賴依以聯合國機構秘書長資格，可以稱為全世界第一位國際主義者。根據聯合國憲章的規定，凡是他所認為足以威脅國際和平與安全的事情，他都可以向安全理事會提出，促其注意。據憲章規定，他的責任是「絕對國際性的」，在職務上不受聯合國任何一國的影響。他真可以算得是全世界的司閽人了。</p>
<p>他的首要工作是管理聯合國機構，他是該機構的首席行政長官，以此資格主持大會，安全理事會，經濟暨社會理事會及託管理事會等各項會議，並須執行各該機講交託給他的其他任務。賴依對於本身以外的任務，無不欣然承受，這是他驚人能力的表現。</p>
<h3 id="c146">他需要幹才任用人員稱職 <a href="#c146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>根據大會所訂規則，賴依得任命秘書處全體職員，並指派適當人員至經濟暨社會理事會及託管理事會。此事不但需要非常的才幹，而且是煞費研究與考慮的。正如他自己所說的：「我們往往先撞見誰，就任用誰，但是我以為最好是慢慢決定，務使所任用的人都能稱職。與其草率從事，等到過了兩三個月以後，方纔發覺自己用錯了人，倒不如事前審慎的為妙。因為到那時調動一二人員，結果會把整個部門完全顛覆了的」。</p>
<p>選任職員，應當根據兩項原則：第一，求得效能，才幹和忠實的最高水準；第二，使任用的職員普遍分佈於各會員國。賴依承認照此兩項標準選用職員，固然用雖滋多，可是他堅決主張這是必要的條件。</p>
<p>賴依得到安全理事會的同意，可把安全理事會所討論的有關維持世界和平與安全的任何問題通知聯合國大會；等到安全理事會停止討論道些問題時，也得同樣通知大會，如果大會適在閉會期間，則通知聯合國會員國。</p>
<p>因此，就選任和指揮戰員的觀點而論，賴依的權力是很大的，實際上等於一個獨裁者。但是就賴式對於各國代表團所有的職權而論，他的任務是調和者，而不是指揮者。</p>
<p>當聯合國大會和安全理事會初次在倫敦開會時，賴依的公開活動是並不注目的。他並不担任主席，他悄然出席會議，悄然退席。的確，要不是他臉上多少帶些緊張的表情，人們會把這位陰森森地坐在會場裏面的人物當做偵探看待的。賴依據艾德禮一樣，在委員會中最得人望，他的忠實的態度，堅決的意志和公正處置問題的態度，給人以好的印象。他不是易受政治利用的那種典型的人物，他沒有演說家的動人姿態。可是，他具備世人和聯合國機構所需要的那種德性。</p>
<p>賴依五十歲時是為全世界的平民仗義執言和鞠躬盡瘁的一個平民。他的智力和才能，是遠在一般人以上，但是在過去七年間，他遭遇到歐洲一般人所遭遇到的肉體上和精神上的危險。他的經驗不但使他和歐洲西部的人民，而且和全世界的人們，發生了親切的感覺。</p>
<h3 id="c147">錯綜的性格懂得應付局面 <a href="#c147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>賴氏有許多矛盾的地方，值得加以研究。某著名法國人批評賴氏為「皮鞋擦得雪亮的無產階級」，這是膚淺的觀察，可是它的確指出了賴氏性格中的兩個矛盾點：他是個無產階級，然而在那錯綜複雜的國際舞台中，他懂得怎樣工作，怎樣應付。</p>
<p>賴氏的性格中很少灰色的成份。他是黑白分明的。意志堅强，恐怕是他的最特出的特徵。他有一般農民精明的思念和堅强的意志，他和挪威第一流律師共同做事。但是這種堅强的意志，因真正的友情而趨於援和。他能以極大的友愛和忠誠對待他的朋友和屬員，但是他也能勃然震怒，驚動他的夥伴，但是有時候沉悶的局面就由此而趨向明朗化。</p>
<h3 id="c148">新工作傾向永遠直言無隱 <a href="#c148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>在最近幾年中，他已經懂得遏制他的憤怒和隨便談論他的工作的傾向了。現在，他流露出和藹溫文的態度。他的臉部長而圓潤，不時笑逐顏開。他時常用手作勢，竭力保持優美的姿勢。</p>
<p>他的逐漸發胖的碩大軀幹，平時總穿着籃色的服裝。他也懂得外交場中鷄尾酒會中的客套的談吐，雖則像英國工黨政府中的多數官員一樣，他並不喜歡這一套社交場中的習氣。許多人有意把聯合國機構新址裝飾起來，但賴依表示反對，他是贊成僕實無華直言無隱的。</p>
<p>他在啟程赴美之前就對人說：「本人希望我們能以事實表示我們是為世界各處的民眾利益而服務的，決不使用昔日的外交慣技。」</p>
<p>賴依畢生曾目睹千百問題由談判討論而獲得圓滿解決，他對於國際問題，力主採用會內或會外討論方式，以求解決。賴氏本人所具有的辯才，已經在政府委員會，法院和挪威政黨的辯論中訓練得很純熟了。他曾經和挪威海員們和英國士兵們討論世界大事，並聽取帮助建設新世界的人們的呼聲。</p>
<h3 id="c149">母親開公寓傾聽工會辯論 <a href="#c149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>賴依在奧斯羅郊外的工業區開始和社會發生關係。他的母親在那裏開設一所小公寓。那時，他還是一個學童，在課餘之暇，時常聽到公寓中瑞典工團主義者和挪威工會會員爭辯是非。</p>
<p>賴依不忍見他母親胼手胝足地操勞着，立志成名發迹。一九一四年，他進奧斯羅大學肄業，但是他離開學校後，並不踏進商界，却加入了挪威勞工黨，而和當地軍站長的女兒約琴生過從甚密。</p>
<p>賴依除潛心於書本和政治外，還變成了奧斯羅大學裏的一位足球和徑賽名手。可是，當他得到法學學位時，他已經做了挪威工黨秘書特蘭曼爾的私人秘書了。一九二一年，他和約琴生結婚，以工黨代表團秘書資格前往莫斯科。賴氏就在這次訪問時，聽到了列寗的演說。</p>
<p>越一年，他担任挪威工會聯合會的法律顧問，一連做了十三年。他除了處理法院案件外，還著作了許多解釋性質的小冊子。他對於勞工政策所持的見解是和緩的。隨着他的政治活動擴大起來，她的交友也就廣闊起來。不久，這位青年勞工律師在凡斯康登所結識的朋友，幾乎跟他在蘇聯所結識的朋友一樣多了。他開始遊歷歐洲西部和北歐各地，同時，這位奧斯羅律師開始踏上了世界公民的里程碑。</p>
<p>但是一九三五年當他加入挪威政府担任司法部長時，他不過是奧斯羅的一個能幹的青年罷了。的確，他的愛好交際的性格，他的急躁的脾氣，他在政治上偶然的錯失，惱怒了黨中的若十要員。其中，有一位要員曾經說過：「我覺得，賴依在一星期中，六天裏頭是一位天才，但是到了第七天，他不過是一個小孩子而已。」</p>
<h3 id="c150">政治的品性從政見上評衡 <a href="#c150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>至於賴依的政治品格，最好從他個人對於二十世紀前半期盛行的兩種主要政洽主義（共產主義和法西斯主義）的反響來加以評定。作為一個社會主義者，他對於蘇聯社會主義的進步情形異常關切，同時以歐洲人的地位他對於蘇聯之在歐洲和世界居於强國地位，惑到異常興奮。但是，因為他是一個北歐的社會民主黨員他是贊成進化而不贊成革命的，又因為他是一個挪威人和西歐人，他是堅決並熱烈地信仰人權法案中的種種自由的。</p>
<p>像這種政治傾向的人，即信仰社會主義的民主黨員，當然要被最高度的法西斯主義國家社會主義所徘斥。賴依目睹德國的社會民主黨被納粹黨魁所解散，他們的領袖被迫放逐或拘禁在集中營裏。他以三百萬人口的國家的內閣中的一位起碼部長，對此當然是毫無辦法，但是我們有理由可以相信，賴依目前潛心致力於世界和平與人類自由的工作，其最大的刺激是在處於訥粹國邊境，目擊德國的黑暗情形時所得到的。</p>
<p>一九三九年九月大戰爆發後一　　，　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　略挪威時，他正管理着挪威所能貢獻給聯合國的最重要的一份資產：　重三百五十萬噸船員二萬五千人的挪威商船隊。</p>
<p>一九四〇年十一月賴依就任挪威外交部長，這是賴氏達到目前地位的進身之階，因為這一個職位使他不但和倫敦的列强代表發生接觸，而且和已披德國所併吞的小國的使節發生關係。</p>
<h3 id="c151">賴依支持者兩個最强國家 <a href="#c151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>賴依目前的地位，引起一般人的猜測：「究竟誰在支持着他？」這種猜測是沒有結果的，因為支持賴依的碰巧是兩個最强大的國家。最先推荐賴依担任聯合國機構中重要職位的國家，不是蘇聯，而是美國，適和一般人的見解相反。一九四五年十一月間美國國務院向蘇聯建議：擬推荐賴依担任聯合國大會主席。後來，這一個位置被史巴克佔去，蘇聯乃推荐賴氏担任目前的秘書長職位。</p>
<p>現在，這位挪威的「平民領袖」和世界偉人日夕相處，同時與民間仍保持着密切聯繫，他有能力替自己出身的階級中的男女謀福利。散居各國的他的朋友們，都認為他是一個爭取和平與人權的堅毅果敢的戰士。</p>

<h3 id="c153">警員應有的責任 <a href="#c153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>編輯先生：我們是從文學校考入警校幹訓班的，可說我們都是很純潔的青年，並於陪都已受過了一年的訓練，所受困苦，真是言語難以形容。直到杭戰勝利，奉令還都，因交通不便，千里跋踄，歷時三月，沿途夜露雨酒，辛苦無比，來到首都警校，舉行學業考試，待令分發。茲值建國開始，首重建警，而中央鑒於有提高警察素質的必要，特頒佈新警察制度，以警管區為推行勤務的基本單位，開始自京滬着手，慢慢推行。因此，上峯就以我們這批同學，試騐新制。請借貴報一述我們的任務，袪除各界的猜疑或誤會。</p>
<p>我們服務的對象是全體民眾，我們的任務，是保民。人民與警察的關係非常密切。兵警察，則社會就不能安定，人民也不能安寗，假使警察離開了人民，則一切勤務就無從談起。民心之得失，又繫於警察能否親近民眾。在民眾當中，警察時刻要發生領導作用，以取得民心。杭戰勝利，更要把握民心，加强建國。</p>
<p>我們認為警察是全體民眾的，並不是屬於少數人的，也不是因為它對於極少數人有所不便，而可以取消的。那末，警察就要深入民間，事事為人民着想，處處為人民打算，尤其我們是現代中國新制度下的新警察。一切的作風，應該　然不同的，並且對民眾尚要盡到管，教·養·衛的職責。舉例來說：</p>
<p>（管）警察管的範圍很廣，所謂，無事不管，並時不管，無地不管。這樣，警察應處處為人。如三輪　規定只准乘坐二人，如果超過規定，警察一定要管，要勸道他以免發生危險。又如人民的住宅，在晚十二點鐘，尚沒有關門，警察一定要他關上，以免盜賊的偷竊。如此應經常負責，行使管的職權，使每個人民都能安居樂業。</p>
<p>（教）警察是人民的導師，街頭的法官。因此，要時時以身作則，改良社會。總裁說：「警察教人，不擇池而施，不擇人而施，亦不擇路而施，教秩序，教紀律，教人以應趨應遵應勉應戒之途」。這就是昭示警察辦事的法則。</p>
<p>（養）警察為人民的褓姆，因此除管教民眾之外，尚要切實愛　民眾，養育民眾。古語：「使老有所終，壯有所用，幼有所長，矜寡孤獨，廢疾者皆有所養」。實為警察養民之最高標準。我們固然為了種種限制，不能做到這種程度，可是我們應懸此為目的，切實為人民負起養的責任。</p>
<p>（衛）警察最大之職責，是保護人民生命財產，維持社會安寗秩序。所以「衛」字是警察職務中最主要的任務。既然警察負有保民衛民的重大責任，當然要有犧牲奮鬥的精神，除暴安良的決心。要為人民除暴，不惜成仁取義，要為人民安良，決心冒險犯難。這樣才能使社會安靜，人民安居也才是警察對人民負了衛的責任。</p>
<p>總之，警察執行職務，要切實為人民負責。警察在任何場所，都有行使職權的機會，可是最容易發生的弊端，即為濫用職權，放棄職權，而這種濫用和放棄的結果，便造成人民輕視的主要原因。人民既輕視警察的職權，那末，又將如何執行職權，如何推進工作呢？因此，要使人民信仰警察的職權，這是首光要解決的問題。譬察執行職務，總要處處以人民的利益為前提，並以切實負責為出發點。為民眾而管，為民眾而散，為民眾而養，為民眾而衛，凡是應該行使的職權，決勿放棄，不應該行使的職權，切勿濫用。要做到這樣，才不愧為新警察制度的警員。袁聲奎</p>

<p>炸彈爆發後的千百萬高熱度，可能會使週圍的海水分裂，回復到它原來的構成份子：輕氣和養氣。等到熱度急速遞減至兩萬度的一剎那，分裂開來的輕養氣原子，便會重行混合一起，恢復為原來水的分子。這就是輕養二氣的化學本質。</p>
<p>海水澎湃大有可觀</p>
<p>所以在一切可能狀熊之下，原子彈的炸裂，將造成一種次要和可能是有聲有色的爆發情形，當海水分子重又回復它本來面目的時候。索爾勃說：這一種海水的洶湧澎湃，很有可觀的地方，但並不怎麼可怕。他又說：原子爆裂平均將使廣一方哩的海水沸熱。「對於各種艦船的主要損害，與其說是從高熱度而來，不如說是由於震撼和爆炸所致」。</p>
<p>原子火光利那即逝</p>
<p>試騐部隊副司令官派　斯海軍少將指說：第一顆試騐彈丟下時，若干輕養二氣的分離現象，可能在大氣性　　層內遭遇到，原子彈在水面上空數百呎處的爆炸，便將造成　種空氣下落的點　。派森斯又稱：去年七月十六日第一顆原子彈在新墨西哥沙漠試投時，固有的原子火光，祗維持「千分之一秒」的一剎那，接着又發現兩道較微的「迥光」，將原子雲霧從紫色變成了粉紅色。這些火光，可能是輕養二氣在空氣中重又合成水點的情形所造成。派氏的結論是：原子炸彈的爆發，未必會造成一連串核心或化學性神經得不可思議的反響現象，所以未必會變成一個怎樣意想不到的破壞性巨怪。（譯自合眾社華盛頓四月十四日電）</p>

<p>— 本報蘇州十二日訊　通訊員吳守仁</p>
<p>時代的巨輸在一刻不停地前進，蘇州却不幸而被遺棄在輪齒輾成的軌跡內，與新時代一天天地隔離得遙遠。它已經顯示了「夕陽無限好，可惜近黃昏」的衰老。</p>
<p>八年敵蹄的蹂躪，固然使蘇州罹受了嚴重的內傷，而復員之後的社會狀况，譬如治安的不安啦，基層自治行政的　敗啦，一切黎明前更黑暗的遭遇，呌蘇州雖然披上了一件勝利的外衣，終掩飾不了內在的傷痕。一百三十餘萬的廣大人民，掙扎於饑饉線上，有居不能安，有業不能樂，瞰望這古老的城市，真有不堪回首之感。</p>
<p>警政自復員以來，就一直緊弛到現在，待遇既清苦，武力又薄弱，短期內似無革新之望，地方治安毫無成就可言，搶刧，　刧事件，時有所聞。每個居住在蘇州的中等階級，一臨薄　，就緊緊地　上了大門，不是熟口音，就休想在晚上　訪他的朋友。警察局主管人事，在短暫的八個月內，已調動了四次。最近省令發表，調江　縣警察局長趙維俊來接充，但還沒有到差。</p>
<p>縣臨參會在成立的初期，很表現了一些民意的新精神。一般輿論都非常表示欽敬。然而，時經一月，除了通過縣預算外，沒有什麼足述之處，最紅顯得很沉寂。民意，處在撥亂還治而滯留於過渡時期的現階段，尚難得到預期的評價，這是很可怨嘆的。</p>

<h3 id="c157">迎王雲五部長 <a href="#c157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>— 益</p>
<p>最近行政院通過，由王雲五先生出長經濟部，我們站在生產建設的立塲，深慶得人。</p>
<p>第一，雲五先生，是國內有數的科學管理專家，科學管理最火的功效，就是能够使一個垂危事業，轉敗爲勝，一個順利的事業，發揚光大。在實行之前，着重統盤籌劃，在實行的過程之中，注重效果與效率。過去雲五先生在一二八滬戰之後，曾經援用科學管理的方法，完成了商務印書館的復興工作，當時的環境，非常惡劣。但結果終究能够使生產增加，利潤增加。目前中國的生產事業，支離破碎，痛苦萬分，所以雲五先生出長經濟部，正可以一展長才，負起復興的重任。</p>
<p>第二，雲五先生來自民間，對於民營業業的一切情形，非常熟悉，今後對於解救民營事業的痛苦方面，一定可以毫無隔膜的謀得合理的解決。</p>
<p>第三，雲五先生曾在戰時訪問英國，對於當時英國的情形，觀察得非常詳盡，他們的完善的制度，正可以在適應國情的條件之下，在中國實施起來。</p>
<p>最近雲五先生在中央社記者訪問的時候，談起「事在人爲」將作為他今後施政的方針，這一點，正是合於科學管理的原則的，他本人對於效率方面十分重社，以前商務印書館有幾個同事，批評雲五先生所說一個人吃飯的時間祇須五分鐘，認爲非事實所可能，因爲一般人對於工作效率方面，太不注重，許多人以太多的時間，放在私事上，而以太少的時間，放在公事上。</p>
<p>我們希望雲五先生出長經濟部以後，能够集合各方面的專門人才，對於今後的方針，有具體的計劃，按步實施，到了相當時間，一定可以看到成效。</p>
<p>研究科學管理的人，對於一種困難的局面，是感覺特殊的興趣的，因爲打開一個困難局面，使牠轉爲順利，轉爲繁榮，就可以顯出一個管理人員的才能，雲五先生對於這一點，一定具有同感，所以他曾認定這次出任經濟部長，是爲做事，不爲做官。因此我們對於雲五先生寄予無限的熱望，更希望他的下屬能够通力合作，負起復興的工作。</p>
<h3 id="c158">英國工商界的新動向 <a href="#c158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>— Claire　Neikhd作　周清和譯</p>
<p>戰事平息以後，各國對於國外市塲的開展，逛行不遺餘力，尤其是英美兩國，這裏所說的各點，正可以作爲我國工商界的參考。　譯者</p>
<p>無論你在勃克林Brooklyn或者薩麼亞Samoa購買貨品，你可以知道英國人已經開始來推銷了。</p>
<p>他們將到美國和世界上每一個其他的國家，他們將把大量的脚踏車，髮刷，無綫電烘麪包機以及蘇格蘭惠斯格到各處推銷，因爲他們祗有兩條路可以走，就是出售貨品或是患着經濟的營養不足而死亡。</p>
<p>因爲美國人有英國人所急需獲得的市塲，英國人很可能遇到經濟的死亡，他們很明白這一點，因此祇是製造精美貨品，以公道的價格出售，還是不够的，他們一定也要成爲世界上最精明的推銷員，爲了道一點，他們產生了一個組織，就是Betor。</p>
<p>Betto是一個縮寫字，牠代表British　Expor　Trade　Research　Organization就是英國出口貿易硏究會，他們這一個組織，注重實際，不尙虛文，有一個卞持人員曾經說過：「我們不希望多話，但這一個組織在一般英國人看來，實在是很美國化的。</p>
<p>即使在美國也很少這種龐大計劃，那一個組織已經準備作爲英國工商界的才能的集合和宣傳機關，牠的最大任務，將是找尋世界市塲，去計算世界各地人民的需要，他們將要產生的需要，或是可以使他們感覺的需要，然後把貨品銷售給他們。</p>
<p>爲完成這個任務起見，必在一世界各地，建立一個周密的通信網，聘請專家主持。那些專家，將根據各地的實際情形，製成表格，包括常地的服裝，氣候，色彩，敎育，風尙，習氣，宗敎等等’根據這些事實的調査，就可以通知本國應該製造什麼東西，把牠們送到什麼地方去，定什麼價錢。</p>
<p>他們有一個堅强的廣吿組織，英文的縮寫是abprice由英國政府給予很大的津貼，就根據美國最好的廣吿方法，製作廣吿，去吿訴土耳其人，亞琴丁娜人，以至於世界各地的人說英國阿司匹靈是醫治頭痛的最好的藥品。無論那一種廣吿媒介物，都不會被忽略過去，——報紙，雜誌，無綫電，電影，有一個英國商會裏的主持人員說：「我們將應用一切美國人所用過的方法，即便是高壓力的推銷方法。</p>
<p>整個計劃，很得到英國政府的襄助，雖則主要的收入是由七十家英國廠商所支付的會費，並有二十萬萬元的資本。</p>
<p>這個組織是去年春季開始的，英國的商界一方面看着美國商人在爭取市塲，一方面看着國內的悄形，的確有一點失望。英國本身必須支付巨大的數目，總共有二百萬萬元之數，一部份是以前在國外各地的投資，曾經獲得很豐盛的利益，但自從戰事發生以後，這個利益的來源，暫時伴止了。一部份是要支付戰爭的代價的。她的人民在任受饑餓，工廠裏的機器亦已經陳舊必須更換，有許多戰前的市塲，已經喪失</p>
<p>因此，出口是英國的生命綫，惟有借着出口吸收的錢，可以應付爲了生活必需進口的東西，目前的數目旣然增加了。所以即使恢復戰前的市場，也不能應付。在一九三九年中，英國會經出口貨品價値二萬四千萬元，現在她祇應該增加百分之五十的出口額。英國的商人們已經開始向着這個目標進發，根據勞埃銀行的主席，曾經說，英國商人固然努力，但到處受到相當的挫折，因爲當英國人到達的地方，他們發現美國人早已在那裏了。</p>
<p>有一個英國的實業家曾經說：「這種情形，使我們正覺得一個女人正爲他的丈夫備好了茶出去，她的丈夫已經和一個救濟的女郞出去，她已經拿出了咖啡的糖納子了。」</p>
<p>這一種競賽，是根當迅速的，但英國決不能遲緩，而應該急起直追，她必須把生產所需要的機器加以改進，把銷售的機構加强，再通過上述的一個組織，用廣吿的方法，使世界各地的人民本來向別國購買貨品的，或者根本不買貨品，可以起而購買英國的貨品。</p>
<p>在美國商人之間，對於這一種工作，是感覺莫大興趣的，商務部長華萊斯說，出口不僅是必需的工作，而且對於美國全民就業計劃，更有密切的關係，所以制定每年要達到一百萬萬元的數目，那一個數目，就是一九三九年出口額的三倍。</p>
<p>在受到了戰事損失的歐洲，可以佔居之數目的一部份，但爲擴展市塲起見，美國人更注意到永久的市堪，英國的目光，也是一樣，她正注意於下列各地……</p>
<p>蘇聯：這是世界上最大市塲之一，有二萬萬人口，需要大量的機器，電氣用品和消費用品。</p>
<p>中國二這是另外一個大市塲，有四萬萬五千萬的人口，如果能够給予長期放款的便利，將需要大量的機器，鐵道用具和消費品。</p>
<p>印度：有三萬萬八千九百萬人口，如果他們有充分的購買力，可以購買各式的製成品。</p>
<p>近東：除埃及土耳共之外，尙有伊拉克·伊蘭·潑拉斯丁等，都是很豐盛的市塲，不可忽略。</p>
<p>拉丁美洲：這是最値得珍貴的市塲，他們在戰時曾培養了很强大的購買力，他們需要運輸工具。農業用具，和電氣用具，美國人已經深入墨西哥·古巴·哥崙比亞等地。英國在金鎊集團中，有亞琴丁那和烏羅格。巴西·比魯·和智利也是大買主，祇要價目便宜。</p>
<p>英國參加這個市塲的競賽，具有一種勝人的優勢，她的機器和曾經訓練的技術是勝過英國的而且原料十分豐富。船隻的數目，也三倍於英國，她更有堅强的財力，可以實行長期的放款。</p>
<p>但是美國人是不肯就停留在他們自身的優點上的，他們已經組織了一個硏究委員會，研究美國國內的推銷問題，另外一組人，正在從事中東部份的調查工作，而美國的龐大的廣告預算——二十五萬萬元——將在南美洲。土耳其·埃及和中國展開工作。</p>
<p>如果單以廣吿能決定勝負而論，美國就可以獲得勝利。但是英國人也有他們的自信力，這種自信力的廣吿是基於幾種現實的情形的。第一，英國人在首相阿特里領導之下，正像邱吉爾時代一樣，具備相　的信心。第二，美國方面，依舊需要英國的貨品，在以前三分之一的美國的出口，是運到英國去的，四分之一的進口貨是由英國運來的，目前美國方面，依舊希望維持這個良好的關係，因爲美國和英國的商業上的競爭固然是非常劇列的，但是也不希望英國走頭無路，而希望彼此能够互助合作。</p>
<h3 id="c159">一定的目標 <a href="#c159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>
<p>— 費文</p>
<p>一個做管理工作的人員，一定要具備一定的目標，在他議決和實行各種事務之前，要根據這個目標故去。</p>
<p>從前美國有一家批發商的事務室的經理，發現他的能錄剖份所用的印刷品的種類太多了，印刷品的種類太多，不但印刷的費用增加，而且使用那太多的印刷品就需要更多的人手，於是費用也就增加了，要解決這個困難，就要利用一種基本的法則，就是要把每一種印刷品考慮一下，是不是絕對需要的？如果不是絕對需要的，那末就可以免除或者把兩種合併爲一種，這樣一來，粥個批發商每年記錄部份節省了三千元的費用，其他間接使其他各部份因手續簡單而節省的費用，尙不計在內。</p>
<p>有一家零售商店，他們的存貨愈弄愈多，但銷路並不好，在仔細一查之下，原來他們所進的貨品，並不能迅速的銷去，因此他們的資金，就因而被擱住而周轉不靈了。硏究之後的解決方法，是當每一種貨品購進的時候，能不能立刻就賣去，採用了這個方針以後，結果就不但使貨品的種類較爲整齊，而且資金的流動，較爲流暢了，這一種方法，也就是採用基本的原則去謀解決的方法。</p>
<h3 id="c160">互商管理概論 <a href="#c160" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e160" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">160</a></h3>
<p>— 徐百益</p>
<p>價格和成本問題</p>
<p>貨品價格和成本問題，對於一個事業的關係，是非常重人的，因此値得我們去加以深切的硏究。如果一個管理人員能够知道價格上落的原因：而去做必要的應付，同時　　地估計他的製造成本，那末他就能够把他的事業處理得很上軌道。</p>
<p>價格Price是什麽？價格是用衡量價値的十個工具，雷我們說一頂帳子的價格是五塊錢，一套衣服的價格是五十塊錢，那末我們就可以知道一套衣服的價格是十倍於一頂帳子，並且可以知道這兩者之間的連帶關係。</p>
<p>各國政府，對於幣制的單位，都有規定。譬如說，在美國一塊錢等於黃金二三，二二，但有時候貨物的價格會得增漲，這就是幣制的價値低落的關係。譬如說某種貨品向來每件是五塊錢，但到了目前，非要五十塊錢，不能買到，這在表面上是貨品的價格增高，實際上却是幣制價値的低落。</p>
<p>在幣制價値日就低落的時候，一個管理人員，能够向各處去借款，定期歸還，無論如何，是合算的。因爲當他借款的時候的幣制，到了償還的時候，價値更爲低落了。但幣制是否繼續低落，是應該事前有目光的，因此是不是應該繼續借款，繼續進貨，在一個經營者方面，是非常重要的。</p>
<p>如果一個管理人員，不顧到市面上可能的變動，而一味向前，並不後顧，等到市價低落的時候，一般人都要存着觀望的態度，停止購買，希望得到更低落的價格，這時候貨品銷路呆滯，流動資金就被擱住，就要形成一蹶不振的狀態，所以對於價格方面的研究，非常重要。</p>
<p>對於價格的漲落，除了幣制問題之外，需要方面的情形，也可以左右價格的。譬如說一家工廠寗願付較高的代價，因爲惟恐不能購到所需的數量，那末價格就會增漲，如果有幾個地方同時出售一種貨品，其中有一家寗願賣較低的價格，那末就足以抑低貨品的價格。</p>
<p>什麼叫做市價Market　Price市價兩個字的解釋，就是一種貨品在市塲上所售的價格。這個市塲要看各種貨品的情形而定。有許多貨品的銷售範圍，祇限於一地，有許多貨品的銷售範圍，可以擴充到全國，甚至全球，在各處的市塲，因爲供應與需要各處不同價格就要有參差不同的情形。譬如說英國的麵粉廠需要買到最火數量的小麥，在利物浦的代表就出較大的價格，於是凡是有小麥的地方，都會趨之若驚，這樣就有影響全世界小麥市塲的可能，所以市價的決定，是由各地需要和供應的情形來做根據的。</p>
<p>上面所說的寗可多出一些代價的買主，是容易增加供應者的數量的，但影響所至，也會發生生產過剩的結果。</p>
<p>常某一種貨品的價目因爲各方面需要較廣而增加，因能產生校多的利潤之後，許多人都要從事這種貨品的生產，而希望獲得可觀的利潤。甚至本來在某工廠作工的人，也要自己來設廠從事製造，這種情形結果，就要使生產過剩，到了那時候，爲使貨品能够繼續銷行起見，不得不跌價傾銷，於是祗有規模較大的工廠，可以繼續維持，規模較小，實力不充享的組織，就要淘汰了。</p>
<p>銷售的費用，包括在貨品成本之內：一般人的見解，往往以爲一種貨品的成本，祇包括牠的製造成本，其實從經濟立塲看，銷售的費用，也應該包括在貨品的成本裏面的。而且在上面已經說過，一種品質精良的貨品，容易為大衆所接受，因此所需要的銷售的費用，也可以較省，凡是銷售的費用較省的貨品，間接就可以影響牠的成本。就是牠的成本也比較地低了，所以在一個事業裏面，雖則貨品的銷行，由營業部份負責，他們也應該竭力使費用減省，否則嘴品的實際製造成本，果然是低廉了，可是銷售的費用很大，或者需要用很大的廣吿費用，方始能够使貨品行銷，那末結果就不能獲得豐厚的利潤。</p>

<h3 id="e1">National Army Recaptures Siping Street Yesterday Morning; Communist Forces East of Chengde Blocked; New Turn of Events in Shenyang-Changchun Situation <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper's office in Shenyang, 19th] Siping Street, gradually advanced upon by the National Army over the past month, was recovered at 8:00 AM on the 19th, marking another new turn of events in the situation between Shenyang and Changchun. When the news reached Shenyang, various newspapers released special editions, sparking a new perspective among the people. Siping City, formerly established under the puppet Manchukuo regime, has a municipal area of 203,606 square kilometers and a population of over 60,000. Railways radiate in all directions, connecting to Korea in the east, controlling the gateway to Mongolia in the west, and connected by the north-south Chinese Changchun Railway. Coupled with the province's abundant agricultural production, Siping City has become virtually the premier agricultural market in southern Northeast China. Its primary products are soybeans, and it is also a major oil and chemical industry base, with numerous oil mills, as well as flour, wine, and cement factories. Siping is indeed a crucial hub for transportation, industry, and economy.</p>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 19th] According to news from local newspapers: The National Army successfully launched a flanking maneuver against the left-wing positions of the Communist forces in the Siping Street area, and has already approached Lishu, northwest of the city. Fierce battles are currently underway to seize the hills northeast of the city.</p>
<p>[French Press Agency, Nanjing, 18th] A government army spokesperson stated today, regarding the situation in Northeast China, that he could neither confirm nor deny reports of a government army offensive against Siping Street in the near future, but implicitly acknowledged that the government army was continuing its attack on the city and subjecting it to heavy bombardment. Meanwhile, a Communist spokesperson firmly asserted that Siping Street was still being defended. The efforts of the government army's elite winter forces have been to no avail. The spokesperson confirmed that hundreds of buildings in the city have been destroyed by bombardment, and civilian losses are heavy, but the Communist forces under General Lin Biao are determined to hold on to the end.</p>
<p>[Report from this newspaper's office in Nanjing, 19th] Late news: The Communist forces advancing eastward from Chifeng, Rehe Province, have been blocked east of Chengde by the elite National Army. The Communist forces are drawing troops from Hebei and Chahar provinces to reinforce Rehe, with the aim of reversing the declining situation in Siping Street and Benxi in Northeast China, but it is too late. Furthermore, after the National Army in Liaobei recovered Xifeng, both flanks have made progress. The morale of the National Army in Northeast China is very high. It is reported that when Bai Chongxi and Sun Liren inspected the front lines, they expressed great satisfaction with the discipline of the National Army. The mission of Generals Bai and Sun to Northeast China is not, as the Communists claim, to launch a general offensive, but their primary mission is to assess the effectiveness of military education in Northeast China. Over the past two weeks, the Communist forces have used various methods to wage a psychological war against the National Army, employing methods of broadcasting and distributing leaflets from aircraft, much like the "Lord Haw-Haw" used by Germany. However, the loyal and brave National Army has remained unmoved, because the National Army in Northeast China has clearly recognized that their goal of recovering Changchun is to reclaim national sovereignty, and anyone who dares to obstruct them is a national traitor. Only with Changchun returned to the nation will any negotiations in Nanjing have a legitimate and reasonable resolution.</p>
<h3 id="e2">Communist Forces Launch Wide-Ranging Attacks on Jiaoji Railway; Dispatch Large Forces to Attack Jinan; Their Intention is to Force the Government to Make Another Concession; Communist Forces Seize Mingyong Station; Towns Still in National Army Hands <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper's office in Jinan, 19th] Based on various recent signs, it is judged that the Communist forces have clearly adopted a strategy of gradually encircling Jinan. General military observers believe that the Communist forces' wide-ranging attacks on the Jiaoji Railway in recent days should not be seen as a prelude to a formal civil war. The Communist forces' objective is still harassment, in order to strengthen the Communist Party representatives' position in military mediation negotiations, attempting to force the government to make another concession. However, the Communist forces are actively preparing for civil war, which is a fact.</p>
<p>[Report from this newspaper's office in Jinan, 18th] Mingshui Station was occupied by the Communist forces, but most of Mingshui Town is still in the hands of the National Army. The Communist forces launched a fierce attack at night, only occupying a corner. Fierce street fighting took place in the town throughout the 18th. The Jinan Group went to mediate on the 18th, but after reaching Guodian, they could not proceed due to damaged railway tracks and bridges. Government representatives are negotiating to proceed on foot to investigate the truth. On the 18th, coal and grain prices in Jinan soared. He Siyuan flew to Nanjing immediately.</p>
<p>[Report from this newspaper's office in Qingdao, 18th] The wide-ranging attacks by Communist forces on the Jiaoji Railway east of Jinan are reported to be a planned operation. The Communist forces are still continuously mobilizing large forces, claiming that they will soon attack Jinan.</p>
<p>[Report from this newspaper's office in Jinan, 18th] From the night of the 17th, the Communist forces carried out large-scale massacres in more than ten villages in Zhonggongbao, south of Jinan City. No able-bodied men were spared, and some entire families were killed, a truly appalling scene. The Jinan Group walked more than ten li east from Guodian to Shijiazhuang to meet with the Communist battalion commander. Because the Communist forces had no responsible person present, the government representatives, including Wen Ze, drafted four proposals: to immediately cease the conflict, repair transportation, and return prisoners and weapons. The proposals were handed over to the battalion commander to forward to Liao Ronglin. On the evening of the 18th, they returned to Jinan and decided to fly to Linyi on the 20th to meet with Chen Yi to discuss a comprehensive solution. The Pacification Headquarters and the Shandong Provincial Government also sent personnel to accompany them.</p>
<p>[Report from this newspaper's office in Qingdao, 18th] The fighting in various places along the Jiaoji Railway east of Jinan is still continuing. The Jinan Executive Group will proceed to the conflict zone immediately to prepare for mediation.</p>
<p>[United Press, Qingdao, 18th] According to the headquarters of the 3rd Marine Brigade of the U.S. Marine Corps: The strength of the Communist forces in Shandong Province is two to one compared to the National Army. If the Communist forces decide to act, they could occupy the entire province within a month. It is claimed that there are 300,000 well-armed Communist troops in Shandong Province, while the National Army has only 150,000. Brigadier General Clemen told a United Press reporter that he believed that the Communist forces had deployed their troops in extremely advantageous locations throughout the province, allowing them to do as they please. He stated that the situation in Shandong depends on the outcome of General Marshall's negotiations.</p>
<p>[Special dispatch from this newspaper's office in Jinan, 18th] From the 15th, Zhuzhuang defense area in Gaotang County has been under fierce attack by more than 4,000 Communist forces for three days. Internal and external communications have been cut off. The defending forces are fighting bloody battles, with heavy casualties. Now they have run out of food and ammunition. County Magistrate Deng Xiechen has telegraphed the authorities to stop or support them to resolve the crisis.</p>
<p>[Special dispatch from this newspaper's office in Jinan, 18th] Yesterday, the Communist forces launched an attack on Zhangdian with the forces of three divisions, totaling more than 20,000 people. The garrisoned troops there are currently fighting bravely. It is also learned that the Communist forces in Tai'an also show signs of unusual movements.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Jinan, 18th] The Communist forces are currently mobilizing the First and Second Brigades of the Communist forces and a part of the Central Shandong Military Region from the Zibo area, gathering near Tai'an, with a total force of ten regiments, showing signs of invading Tai'an.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Jinan, 18th] A motorcade of 14 vehicles of the Jinpu Railway Bureau transporting relief supplies, carrying 30 tons of relief flour from Gaomi to Zhangdian, stopped in Zhangdian due to continuous rain. On the 16th, when they returned to Gaomi, carrying 500 Japanese expatriates being repatriated, they were intercepted by the Communist forces in Yidu, and all vehicles and drivers and assistants were detained. Relief sub-bureau and railway bureau escorts were driven back to Zhangdian.</p>
<h3 id="e3">Tianjin and Beijing Very Tense; Communist Forces Enter Mentougou <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>[United Press, Beijing, 19th] Today, because it was heard that the Communist forces had entered Mentougou, 17 miles west of Beijing, the situation inside the city became very tense. Sandbags have been piled up outside various military facilities. A senior government official soothed the public, claiming that there was no need to panic, but after nightfall, the police closed the gates of the inner city, questioned passersby, searched hotels, and increased patrols at important locations.</p>
<p>[United Press, Tianjin, 19th] In the announcement of the Security Team's recovery of Liu'anzhuang, Tianjin citizens today learned for the first time in the Ta Kung Pao that Communist forces or irregulars were only five miles from Tianjin. It was also learned that some locations 15 to 20 miles west and northwest of Tianjin have been retaken from the Communist forces.</p>
<p>[Report from this newspaper's office in Beijing, 19th] Liujiakou, east of Baoding, was attacked last night by more than 600 Communist forces. After two hours of fierce fighting, the Communist forces retreated. The National Army pursued them and discovered suspicious new graves along the way, from which more than 200 landmines were excavated. Also, Zhujiazhuang, south of Baoding, was attacked by the Communist forces at midnight this morning. Due to being outnumbered, dozens of National Army soldiers were captured, and they are still under siege. At the same time, the power lines in that area have been largely destroyed.</p>
<h3 id="e4">Gaoling Station Recovered; Railway Under Repair <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Beijing, 19th] According to a phone call from Shanhaiguan, Gaoling Station and other places east of Qian Suo Station on the Yujin section of the Beining Railway have been recovered by the National Army. The damaged railway is currently under repair and will be open to traffic soon.</p>

<h3 id="e6">Food Supply to Shenyang Blocked; Rao Shushi Uninterested in Repatriation of Japanese POWs <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper's office in Shenyang, 17th] Amidst the gloomy situation in the Northeast, the people of Shenyang and other cities are greatly troubled by the lack of food and high prices due to the blocking of food supplies. The work of the Three-Person Group has been stalled for a long time. On the 17th, U.S. Colonel Pan Lin of the Military Mediation Department went to Siping Street and then to Changchun to negotiate with the Communist side on the issue of repatriating Japanese prisoners of war in the areas controlled by the Communist forces. This reporter specifically asked Mr. Rao Shushi, the leader of the Communist side of the Three-Person Group, for his opinion on this matter. According to Rao, he is not interested in this issue because the Japanese prisoners of war in the areas controlled by the Communist forces have already been transported away. As for Japanese expatriates, a temporary policy of dealing with them can be adopted. Currently, there are larger issues than repatriating Japanese expatriates that have not yet been addressed, and this move is putting the cart before the horse. He also said that it is not very difficult to repatriate Japanese expatriates in the Northeast, and in the future, they can be sent to Korea, which would be much more convenient. As for opening up food supplies, as long as there is a good solution, it should not be a problem.</p>
<h3 id="e7">Communist Forces Launch General Offensive; Marshall's Peace Efforts Greatly Threatened <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>[Special dispatch from this newspaper's office in Nanjing, 19th] According to neutral figures close to both government and Communist representatives: Based on the current situation, the only effective way to resolve the current crisis is a ceasefire. If we use the method of negotiating while fighting to eliminate disputes, it is no different than climbing a tree to catch fish. We should recognize the mission of the upcoming Comprehensive Group Meeting and place high hopes on it, because this group meeting will conduct sincere consultations on three important topics: the number of National Congress representatives, the reorganization of the government, and the review of the draft constitution, in order to establish fair and reasonable resolutions so that the National Assembly can be convened as soon as possible to discuss and decide on the constitution, reorganize the government, and achieve the goal of unity and unification, rebuild the Republic of China, and usher in a peaceful and prosperous era. However, to ensure the smooth progress and satisfactory results of the Comprehensive Group Meeting, the flames of war that have been raging across the country must be extinguished quickly, because the smell of gunpowder from the battlefield, once it permeates the conference hall, will be enough to provoke either side and lead to a deadlock. Based on the various signs of the past week, it is believed that Special Envoy Marshall has already considered this point carefully and will use his outstanding wisdom to promote the parallel progress of the two major tasks of "military mediation" and "political negotiation," hoping to prevent the flames that have already been ignited from spreading again. Judging from past experience, the prospects for the success of "military mediation" are very slim. If we make a judgment based on the current complex situation in Northeast China, Rehe, and North China, then the hope is extremely slim. However, Special Envoy Marshall does not hesitate to use words and tirelessly strives for mediation, indicating that behind-the-scenes news has clearly shown that Special Envoy Marshall's work is indeed heading towards failure, and it is believed that the situation will have a major development when the Comprehensive Group Meeting is held.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 19th] The Committee for the Clearance of Wartime Cultural Relics Losses of the Ministry of Education, in order to investigate Japan's plunder of Chinese cultural relics to seek compensation, previously sent Li Ji and Zhang Fengju to Japan in late April as advisors and experts of the Chinese delegation to the Allied Council for Japan, accompanying the head of the delegation, Zhu Shaming. Now that Zhu has returned to the country, the committee held its first meeting in the Ministry of Education since returning to the capital on the 18th of this month to hear the report. It was reported that more than 100 boxes of books belonging to the Central Library that were left in Hong Kong before the war and transported to Japan by the Japanese have been ordered to be returned by MacArthur's headquarters in Tokyo and are currently being inventoried, with repatriation expected within two months. In addition, objects excavated by the Japanese in Anyang and Zhoukoudian will also be returned soon. MacArthur has ordered the Japanese government to prohibit the export of all cultural relics. For cultural relics illegally obtained by Japan in various places since the July 7th Incident, the Japanese government has also been ordered to compile a list and submit it by June 1st. Mr. Li has visited various public and private cultural relic collections in Tokyo, Osaka, and Kyoto. MacArthur's headquarters has stated that all Chinese cultural relics plundered or illegally purchased by Japan may be returned, but concrete proof must be provided. The committee now intends to propose to the Far Eastern Commission in Washington to advance the deadline for seeking compensation for cultural relics to the Sino-Japanese War of 1894-1895. At the same time, it is rushing to compile a catalog of important cultural relics lost during the war to be submitted to MacArthur's headquarters. However, many of the letters of registered losses received by the committee from various parties lack concrete descriptions and accurate evidence, causing many difficulties during the investigation and negotiation. Applicants are requested to pay special attention.</p>

<h3 id="e24">Yunnan Provincial Garrison Headquarters Cracks Down on Bandits in Kunming <a href="#e24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent, Kunming, 18th] The Yunnan Provincial Garrison Headquarters cracked down on organized bandits in Kunming on the 16th and 17th, arresting more than 30 key criminals. They are currently intensifying their efforts to arrest accomplices in order to fully solve the case and maintain security in Yunnan. It is reported that these bandits are scattered in several counties near Yunnan and along transportation lines, with Kunming as their main base. The robberies that have occurred in Kunming in recent months are all related to them. The Garrison Headquarters discovered clues to their activities and secretly sent skilled intelligence personnel to infiltrate them, even collaborating with them in two small robberies. It was learned that each person had to pay 20,000 yuan, provide their own pistol, and be able to provide vehicles to facilitate their activities. It is rumored that their numbers have now expanded to more than 300. After carrying out several major robberies, they planned to purchase large quantities of guns, ammunition, and vehicles, and then retreat into the mountains to establish a base. On the evening of the planned robbery, the bandits gathered in a teahouse on Wenlin Street. The Garrison Headquarters believed that the time to crack the case had come, so it dispatched a large number of plainclothes officers and soldiers to lie in ambush nearby. The jeep that the bandits were traveling in was driven by an intelligence officer secretly sent by the Garrison Headquarters. When the car reached the ambush line, the driver used the excuse of a flat tire to ask the bandits to get out of the car and push it. Upon a prearranged signal, the area was surrounded from all sides. The bandits opened fire to resist arrest, and the bandit leader, Liu [illegible], was killed on the spot.

At the same time, he adjusted and improved the Sino-American transport relationship. As for the sudden change and Yun Chang's consultation with the Communist side on the repatriation of Japanese prisoners of war and overseas Chinese in the Communist-controlled areas, it seems that it was because it was known that the Communist side was not very interested in this matter and that there would be no effect from going, just a waste of time.

<p>[Our Correspondent, Suzhou, 19th] The price of rice in this county was still around 50,000 yuan the day before yesterday, but yesterday it suddenly broke through 60,000, and today it is approaching 70,000. This kind of rise is unprecedented. Salaried workers and petty merchants are facing starvation, and the crisis is causing anxiety all day long. The social unrest is at an extreme point. In particular, civil servants, police, and security personnel have exhausted all means of raising money and are borrowing without success. They are serving the public with empty stomachs and are on the verge of collapse. Following the general strike of colleagues at the Suzhou High Court, all police officers of the County Police Department are also planning to request a uniform long leave today. The cadres and staff of the county government's various departments have already expressed their intention to strike yesterday. It is truly impossible for them to endure the tumultuous waves of these prices, as personal integrity cannot overcome the crying of wives and children due to hunger and cold. Magistrate Yuan specially convened an emergency meeting last night, inviting representatives from asset groups such as the Land Improvement Association, the Good Deeds Association, the Storage Association, the Agricultural Reconstruction Association, and the County Chamber of Commerce to attend and discuss emergency relief measures. It was immediately decided to borrow 2,000 shi of white rice from the aforementioned groups.

<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 19th] Wu Zijian, Director of the Fuxu (Comfort and Relief) Committee Office, has arrived in Beijing from Chongqing. Speaking to reporters about the distribution of comfort money after the victory, he said that the committee, upholding the wishes of Chairman Chiang, has repeatedly increased the amount of comfort money for wounded and disabled soldiers and families of those killed in action during the war, due to the rising wartime price index. This has significantly benefited the wounded and families of the deceased. Since the victory against the enemy and their surrender, another special comfort money and victory comfort money have been approved for distribution. For example, the family of a deceased private can receive a total of 55,500 yuan, and the family of a deceased major can receive a total of 155,000 yuan. Chongqing began distributing on May 1st. As of my departure from Chongqing, over 100 million yuan had been distributed. Beijing will start distributing immediately. All comfort money to be distributed in various provinces will be handled by the provincial offices. The reporter further inquired about the reorganization of the Military Affairs Commission into the Ministry of National Defense, and how the Fuxu (Comfort and Relief) Committee's structure would change. It was said that no orders had been received yet. However, the committee's work is more important after the war than during the war. During the eight years of resistance, four to five million soldiers were wounded or killed. Due to transportation difficulties and personnel relocation, only over 500,000 people have applied for comfort money. The rest will be actively handled after the return to normal. Moreover, the comfort period is 20 years, which cannot be stopped immediately. Once Director He returns to Beijing after inspection, he will ask the Chairman for instructions.</p>

<h3 id="e42">Please, New Mayor, Suppress and Stabilize Rice Prices! <a href="#e42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>The new Mayor of Shanghai, Mr. Wu Guozhen, takes office today. We welcome the new Mayor, and at the same time, we have expectations of the new Mayor!</p>
<p>Today, what threatens Shanghai citizens the most are high prices and frequent labor unrest, and the soaring rice prices are the most critical key to this. The first major thing for Mayor Wu to do upon taking office is to suppress and stabilize rice prices. This is the central issue to solve all problems. Mayor Wu said that he only knows how to do practical things for the citizens and does not like empty talk and propaganda. We welcome this statement, and we especially expect him to first do well the major thing of "suppressing and stabilizing rice prices" for the citizens.</p>
<p>The recent soaring rice prices, suddenly breaking through the 60,000 mark, not only frightens the common people but also threatens all Shanghai citizens with starvation. "Food is the most important thing for the people, and rice prices are the benchmark for all prices; soaring rice prices will inevitably become the biggest factor in causing social unrest." The soaring rice prices can indeed be excused by the food shortage, but the rice reserves in the city are not necessarily sharply reduced, so why is it rising so much day after day? The artificial factor in this must account for a very large proportion. Unfortunately, the municipal authorities, because the transition is imminent, are kicking the ball regarding the troublemaking in the rice market, only standing by and watching. Rice weevils are taking advantage of the opportunity, and what else can the people say!</p>
<p>We analyze the reason for this rice price surge, which is purely an artificial panic. Shanghai is a city full of hot money. Because the national industry is exhausted and unable to rise, the hot money has no proper outlet and is creating evil in society, which has not been a day or two. It is rumored that recently a few tycoons have organized a rice-buying company, scouring food rice warehouse receipts in the market and deliberately raising prices. It is also said that those with political intentions are also using the extorted legal tender to disrupt the rice market in Jiangnan. These people have the same hearts as speculative rice merchants, only fearing that rice prices will not rise, and can truly be said to "deserve to die." They have bullied the weakness of the authorities in the past, repeatedly showing off their tricks. First, they said that Shanghai has a small amount of rice reserves and requested a loan to purchase grain. Then, the grain loan was issued, but the price rose instead, so they blamed the grain loan for causing trouble and coerced the authorities to stop the loan to purchase grain. Finally, they took advantage of the reorganization of the municipal government to compete for warehouse receipts and greatly raise their prices. This is completely deliberately joking with the government and making enemies of the common people. The new Mayor should give these social monsters a "three fires upon arrival"!</p>
<p>According to the investigation and statistics of grain experts, the rice reserves in Shanghai are still quite sufficient. The amount of rice stored in rice shops and warehouses is considerable, enough for current needs. If there is no crazy company hoarding and manipulating the market, then there will be no panic and no soaring rice prices. Therefore, in addition to asking the Mayor to severely punish the rice monsters, we must also ask the people to respond calmly and do not panic. Everyone should not rush to buy rice and "add fuel to the fire," causing rice prices to continue to soar. At the same time, we must also request the municipal authorities to immediately investigate the total amount of rice in all rice shops and warehouses in the city, set a deadline for registration, so that they can be strictly controlled and implement "grain rationing according to population." Then, based on Mayor Wu's past diplomatic experience, he should do his best to negotiate with the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) and the United Kingdom, the United States, Siam, and Vietnam to import a large amount of foreign rice to relieve China's food shortage.</p>
<h3 id="e43">The Yoshida Cabinet of Japan <a href="#e43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>The weak and difficult-to-produce Yoshida cabinet of Japan may be born in a few days after a few days of pain. As of the time of this article's publication, the list of cabinet members has not yet been published; what has been decided is that, in addition to Prime Minister Yoshida concurrently serving as Minister of Foreign Affairs, there are only Minister of Finance Ishibashi Tanzan, Minister of Justice Iwata Chuzo, Minister of Transportation Hiraoka Tsunejiro, and Ministers of State Kijuro Shidehara and Saito Takao, and Uehara Etsujiro; the remaining cabinet members are still being negotiated. Looking at the lineup, most of them are Japanese conservatives, which can simply be said to be an extension of the Shidehara cabinet, which has aroused dissatisfaction from various leftist parties and factions in Japan; even in our country's public opinion, it is unanimously believed that even if the Yoshida cabinet is born, it may not be long-lived.</p>
<p>In observing today's Japanese politics, we must not forget that Japan is the culprit of World War II and should bear the major responsibility for poisoning mankind. In today's post-war era, while countries do not have to adopt a policy of revenge and severe punishment toward Japan, they must effectively control it to ensure that its aggressive forces cannot be revived and become a threat to world peace again. In order for the post-war world to enter an era of peace and democracy, democratic countries have unanimously recognized that it is necessary to start with transforming Japanese politics. However, today's Japanese politics are tens of millions of miles away from the ideals and goals we hold.</p>
<p>First, although the Japanese people have gone through this surrender and accepted the joint control of the Allied powers, they still do not admit that they are a defeated country in their hearts, and they have not given up their ambitions, thinking that as long as they are given time, they can make a comeback. This mentality is very common. At the same time, the stubborn thinking of the Japanese people has not changed due to this defeat. The poison of aggressive thinking and militarism is almost deeply rooted in the minds of the Japanese people. Especially those young people still cherish the old dream of "Hakkō ichiu," are obsessed with the idea that defeat is temporary and control is superficial, and that there is a possibility of making a comeback soon. At the beginning of last month, some Japanese "patriotic men of ambition" were secretly working underground, carrying out organized sabotage against the Allied forces. This is enough to show that the Allied powers' work of transforming Japan and eliminating aggressive thinking has not been effective.</p>
<p>Second, Japanese politics have not truly embarked on the path of democratization. The fundamental reason why the Japanese warlords were able to launch a war of aggression regardless of public opinion was that Japanese politics were undemocratic, and political power was manipulated by a small number of warlords, bureaucrats, and capitalists. On the surface, it has the prototype of British and American-style parliamentary politics, but in essence, it is a completely anti-democratic fascist regime. The rulers can act arbitrarily and do not need to seek public opinion. After the war, the Allied powers' control over Japan was intended to make Japanese politics embark on the road of democratization, but in the past nine months, has Japanese politics embarked on this road? It is certainly impossible to make a hasty judgment, but looking at the results of the Japanese general election in mid-April of this year, the Liberal Party occupied 139 seats in the Japanese parliament, the Social Democratic Party 93 seats, the Progressive Party 91 seats, the Concord Party 16 seats, the Communist Party 5 seats, and non-partisan factions 84 seats, which makes us have to be greatly disappointed. Because we know that the so-called Liberal Party is a substitute for the Seiyukai, and the Progressive Party is a substitute for the Minseito. These two major parties have been playing the main role on the Japanese political stage for nearly a century, and in theory, they should bear great responsibility for this war. However, in post-war Japanese politics, they are still allowed to occupy a very important position, changing the soup but not the medicine, only changing a sign. How can we hope that Japanese politics will embark on the right track of democratization?</p>
<p>After the results of the general election were announced, the Shidehara cabinet should have stepped down long ago, allowing the leader of the Liberal Party, Ichiro Hatoyama, to take over and form a cabinet. However, Hatoyama was dismissed. Not only did his dream of becoming Prime Minister fail to come true, but he also lost the leadership of the Liberal Party. The political situation was turbulent and there was no successor, but Shidehara would step down sooner or later. Finally, he came up with a way to resurrect the dead: to discover new figures, secretly contact Yoshida, advocate the merger of the Liberal Party and the Progressive Party, and have Yoshida form a cabinet, while he himself would still be pulling the strings behind the scenes, directing everything. Although his method was approved by MacArthur, the coalition cabinet organized by the two parties, which was full of conservative colors, was not only inherently deficient and difficult to produce, but would inevitably be short-lived due to acquired maladjustment, even if it did not miscarry. The serious problems faced by the Yoshida cabinet are countless, the most important of which are the following:</p>
<p>(1) The opposition of the people. At present, no one in the Japanese people does not believe that the Yoshida cabinet is an extension of the Shidehara cabinet and has unanimously expressed opposition; especially the Social Democratic Party, which is determined to fight the conservative faction to the end. The Yoshida cabinet cannot ignore the opposition of the democratic camp.</p>
<p>(2) The seriousness of the food shortage problem. The most pressing crisis in Japan today is the increasingly serious food shortage problem. If the Yoshida cabinet can shoulder this heavy burden and prevent the Japanese people from being threatened by famine, then its future is still promising. Therefore, he has repeatedly considered the candidate for Minister of Agriculture, and even did not hesitate to visit the Teikoku University professor Seiichi Tohata three times to ask him to take the position, but "a clever woman cannot cook without rice," and he firmly declined. This problem has also become the main reason for the difficult birth of the Yoshida cabinet.</p>
<p>(3) The constitutional issue, including the issue of the Emperor's survival. According to the gist of the Allied powers' control over Japan, it is necessary to make Japanese politics embark on the right track of democratization, and it goes without saying that a new constitution must be drafted. However, regarding the issue of the Emperor's survival, the Japanese are divided, with those in favor and those opposed each accounting for half. Therefore, how to mediate so as to obtain a satisfactory solution is a very difficult problem.</p>
<p>(4) The cooperation between the Liberal Party and the Progressive Party is temporary, not permanent. How can the Yoshida cabinet stay in its position? What's more, the backers supporting these two parties have already fallen, and the Mitsui and Mitsubishi financial groups no longer exist. Who will support the economy in the future?</p>
<p>In short, the Yoshida cabinet is inherently deficient, weak and difficult to produce, and with the current difficulties piled up, it is difficult to have a bright future!</p>

<h3 id="e44">Byrnes to Broadcast Speech Today: Reports on Detailed Process of Foreign Ministers Conference. Byrnes Immediately Visited Truman After Returning to Washington and Had a Long Talk. Believes Conference Was Not a Complete Failure on Treaty Issues <a href="#e44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>[US Information Service, Washington, 18th] US Secretary of State Byrnes returned to the US from Paris today and immediately discussed with President Truman for two hours. Byrnes has not yet made any public statements, but said he will broadcast a speech on the 20th to report on the Foreign Ministers Conference. Other members of the US delegation attending the Foreign Ministers Conference have also returned to the US. However, Assistant Secretary of State Dunn is still staying in Paris to continue discussions with those who have not returned home on behalf of the US, in order to resolve some issues before the Four Foreign Ministers meet again on June 15th. Senator Connally, after returning to the US, immediately convened a press conference, saying that although the Foreign Ministers Conference was not as satisfactory and complete as expected, he believes that this conference has paved the way for the gradual resolution of the next conference. The achievements of the Foreign Ministers Conference are still considerably far from our hopes, but there has been progress, and therefore the next conference (June 15th) will be considerably helpful when discussing treaty issues again. Connally also said: He will report to the Senate on the 22nd on the Foreign Ministers Conference. On the same day, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee (of which he is chairman) will also convene a meeting to hear and discuss his report. Senator Vandenberg also plans to report to Congress on the 21st on his thoughts on the Foreign Ministers Conference.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 19th] Byrnes said today that the Foreign Ministers Conference cannot be said to have been a complete failure in resolving treaty issues. According to some sources, Byrnes may have reported to the President that the results of the conference were not as bad as they appeared on the surface. If given time to discuss the various European treaties, such as those of Germany, the US, Soviet Union, Britain and France can reach a consensus. Byrnes is not as pessimistic as when he first left for Paris on the 23rd of last month. He deeply feels that he should make every effort to end the situation left over from the war in Europe as soon as possible. Except for Germany, the occupying forces of all countries should be withdrawn, and the European peace conference should not be delayed too much.</p>

<h3 id="e45">Anglo-American-Soviet Public Opinion Mutually Accuses Each Other, Each Shifting Blame for the Failure of the Foreign Ministers Conference <a href="#e45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>The Soviets Claim Britain and America are Attempting Atomic Diplomacy</p>
<p>[Reuters, Moscow, 19th] Less than twelve hours after Molotov returned from the Four Power Foreign Ministers Conference in Paris, "New Times" magazine published seven unusually harsh essays and one editorial, criticizing the foreign policies of Britain and America, accusing them of using "atomic weapon diplomacy," and blaming the British and American delegations for deliberately making things difficult for the Soviet Union in international conferences, refusing to accept solutions that the Soviet Union and small countries could agree to. One of these articles, signed by Taikin, raised a series of questions, pointing to the growing unemployment crisis in the United States and the US government's ambition to acquire military bases as proof of the hypocrisy of Anglo-American democracy. Another article, signed by Zhukov, criticized the attitudes of Byrnes and Bevin at the Paris Foreign Ministers Conference, stating that they were not premised on international security, lasting peace, or the protection of the interests of small countries. The article also stated that in recent months, Anglo-American diplomacy had abandoned the attitude of equal cooperation and mutual understanding with other countries, and was attempting a policy of force and atomic diplomacy.</p>
<p>[United Press, London, 18th] Moscow Radio today broadcast "New Times" magazine articles, accusing Britain and America of using the resolutions of the San Francisco Conference "solely for their own interests" and drawing attention to the "dangerous new trends" being discovered in Anglo-American foreign policy. The report recalled the military and political cooperation that existed between Britain, America, and the Soviet Union during the war but claimed that international reactionary forces are now conspiring to overturn the edifice of peace and security that has yet to solidify.</p>
<p>British Newspapers Entirely Blame the Soviet Union</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 18th] Political figures here, reviewing the situation resulting from the adjournment of the Four Power Foreign Ministers Conference, are not very enthusiastic but express calmness. They believe that the Paris conference was like a "football match" where no one scored, and it was hastily ended but could be resumed on June 15th without any party losing face. At the same time, British newspapers are entirely blaming the Soviet Union for the failure of the Foreign Ministers Conference. Various newspapers have given reasons to believe that the Soviet Union maintained a "tough" attitude. Anti-Soviet newspapers accuse the Soviet Union of merely delaying time in order to complete the organization of the Soviet occupied zone behind the "Iron Curtain" in Eastern Europe. Newspapers with a more moderate attitude towards the Soviet Union believe that the Soviet delegation underestimated the importance of certain major events to the Anglo-Saxon countries.</p>
<p>The Soviets Claim Britain and America are Attempting Atomic Diplomacy</p>
<p>[US Information Service, San Francisco, 18th] American newspapers have recently written articles commenting on the adjournment of the Paris Foreign Ministers Conference. Most newspapers express regret that the diplomats failed to reach agreement on key issues. However, the New York Times stated that the conference was not entirely fruitless thanks to the active leadership of Secretary of State Byrnes. The newspaper published this opinion because Byrnes strongly advocated that the foreign ministers should continue negotiations on June 15th. An editorial in the New York World-Telegram and Scripps-Howard newspapers stated that since the foreign ministers of Britain, France, America, and the Soviet Union failed to reach an agreement, the only fair solution would be for the four powers to entrust the responsibility of drafting the treaty to the twenty-one countries that actually participated in the war.</p>

<p>[Agence France-Presse, Bucharest, 18th] Professor Laski, Chairman of the British Labour Party, told reporters from the Romanian Free Press yesterday that the Romanian people must understand that Britain and the British Labour Party will never go to war with the Soviet Union to defend the interests of reactionary forces in the Balkan countries, which would immediately lead to a civil war at home. We are currently trying to reach a close understanding with the Soviet Union and all democratic countries. As far as Romania is concerned, the most important issue is to establish a solid democratic order among all democratic forces within the United Nations.</p>

<p>[Report from this Newspaper] San Francisco, 19th Broadcasting: The Iranian representative today requested the Security Council to allow Iran to postpone reporting on the withdrawal of Soviet troops from Azerbaijan. It is said that the Security Council stipulated on May 8th that Iran should submit a report on the withdrawal of Soviet troops by tomorrow (the 20th). The Iranian side requested a postponement because it had not yet received notification from the Soviet side.</p>
<p>[Reuters, New York, 19th] Iranian Prime Minister Saed notified the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Lie, last night that the Iranian government would report to the Security Council on the situation of the withdrawal of Soviet troops from Iran as soon as possible, and stated that it was currently unable to report the details of the Soviet troop withdrawal to the Council on May 20th, as stipulated in the Council's resolution of May 8th.</p>
<p>[United Press, New York, 18th] Several representatives of the Security Council said today that when the Council reconvenes on Tuesday or Wednesday of next week, the Soviet representative may refuse to discuss the Iranian issue.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 19th] Tehran Radio announced that the four-member delegation sent by the Iranian government to the Azerbaijan province arrived in Tabriz, the capital of the province, and then went to a certain place northeast of the city to investigate whether the Soviet troops had completely withdrawn from the province and would later submit an investigation report to the Prime Minister.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Tabriz, 18th] Pishevari, the leader of the autonomous government of Azerbaijan province, recently told reporters from this agency that the negotiations between the province and the central government have broken down, and that although Prime Minister Saed wanted to reach an understanding with Azerbaijan province, other cabinet members firmly opposed it, leading to the breakdown of negotiations. The central gendarmerie has been rampant in Azerbaijan province, and they will never be allowed to return. If necessary, the people of this province will fight to the last drop of blood to fight for freedom and reform. At this point, the reporter asked whether troops were concentrated on the border of Azerbaijan province. Pishevari replied that the troops of Azerbaijan province are prepared to deal with all emergencies. The border has not been sealed off, and is only guarded by the defense forces. In any case, I still hope that the central and local governments can reach an agreement soon.</p>

<p>[Reuters, Washington, 19th] The American Federation of Labor issued a declaration last night, condemning the policies adopted by the Soviet Union since the end of the war, expressing concern about the increasing threat of a third world war, and emphasizing the differences in policies between Britain, America, and the Soviet Union. The declaration stated that the Soviet Union, in both Europe and Asia, acts arbitrarily without consulting with other countries. The Soviet Union has detained occupied territories and expanded its sphere of influence in Asia and Eastern Europe by various means. Its actions are less like self-defense and more like aggression. If the Soviet Union adopts a tough policy, then we should show that we can adopt a tough policy to protect fundamental principles. We ask the US government to firmly declare that the Soviet Union should fulfill its responsibilities under the Atlantic Charter.</p>

He gave a speech in Cressex, Essex, stating that Greece has become a volcano and could erupt at any time. Ninety percent of the Greek government is fascist.

<p>[Report from this Newspaper] London, 19th Broadcasting: Dutch East Indies Governor-General Van Mook is resuming negotiations with East Indies leaders today.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Batavia, 19th] Warfare is rampant throughout the interior of Java, and the forty million islanders are actively organizing for war with complete determination. Young people in many villages in the central region are receiving military training with enthusiasm, and left-wing workers are not to be seen. There is still no sign of resuming talks with the Netherlands. Indonesian leaders are all confident of achieving their minimum demands, based on their actual strength rather than hoping that the Netherlands will meet their wishes in the next talks. Most Indonesians believe that the 20,000 Dutch troops stationed in Java and the few Dutch troops in Sumatra are not enough to prevent the two islands from declaring independence if they do not receive the support of British troops (who are already withdrawing).</p>

<p>[Remodeling Press, Tokyo, 19th] Just after the May Day holiday, over twenty thousand people held a large rally in front of the Imperial Palace Plaza today. Around 9 o'clock, most of the plaza was already occupied by these people. Heads bobbed and red flags flew. The participants were of all stripes. One group was uniformly dressed in red shorts, with white cloth pasted on their chests, on which was written "Oppose the Reactionary Cabinet, Establish a People's Government." One youth team uniformly wore white hats. A group of elementary school students held up a banner that read "We're Starving!" led into the plaza by their teachers. Around 10 o'clock, people began to speak from a temporary platform made of ten trucks, saying that the Emperor does not hear our voices of hunger, that reactionary elements only seek to suppress the people's voices, that food should be managed by the people, that distribution must be fair, and that the people must establish a democratic cabinet, etc. A woman carrying a baby spoke from the platform on behalf of housewives, demanding food. A fifth-grade student also took the stage and said that we have no rice to bring to school to fill our stomachs at noon, and we have no heart to study. Communist Party Secretary-General Tokuda also took the stage and shouted to form a democratic front, establish a democratic government, and solve the food problem only by reforming the government structure. Finally, they passed a letter to the Emperor. The meeting adjourned at 10:30 and proceeded with a demonstration. The ranks were neat and orderly. Passing by the headquarters of the Yoshida cabinet, which was in the midst of a difficult formation, they shouted slogans such as "Down with the Reactionary Government" and "We Want Food," mixed with the Internationale and the Red Flag song. At 1 pm, the vanguard of thousands of people first arrived at the planned dispersal point, the plaza in front of the Sakashitamon gate of the Imperial Palace, and rushed to within fifty meters of the gate. A hundred policemen attempted to stop them with batons, and a small conflict broke out with the crowd. Wooden sticks and hats flew in the air, but order was finally restored by the leaders and they dispersed.</p>

<p>[Reuters, Washington, 19th] It is understood that Argentina, the Soviet Union, and Siam have not yet accepted the invitation issued by the World Food and Agriculture Organization conference. Soviet officials said that the matter still needs to be discussed with the various Soviet republics and have not yet responded. Argentina is still in consultation.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 18th] The International Food Conference is scheduled to open here on Monday to discuss a grand scheme to ensure that everyone in the world has enough to eat, but the Soviet Union has not agreed to provide assistance. The conference is convened by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization and will address many of the issues related to the current famine and focus on issues beyond 1945. US experts plan to propose improving the International Food Agency by adding representatives from Australia, Argentina, and France to the United Food Committee. Currently, the members of the committee are only the US, Britain, and Canada. A representative from UNRRA may also attend the committee to better represent countries such as China that are receiving UNRRA relief. UNRRA personnel have previously criticized the Food Committee for failing to allocate as much food as UNRRA requested. The conference will last eight days, and no fewer than twenty countries and international organizations related to food issues will participate. According to the Soviet Embassy in the United States, the Soviet Union will not send representatives to attend or observers to listen. The purpose of the conference is to establish a permanent agreement on food production and distribution between the major food-producing countries. At the opening of the meeting on Monday, the representatives will listen quietly to President Truman's address. The committees will spend most of their time holding closed-door meetings this week to formulate a permanent plan to solve the world's food problems, which will be submitted to the plenary session on the 27th for approval and then submitted to the plenary session of the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization. According to US authorities who declined to be named, Marshal Stalin has refused President Truman's request for the Soviet Union to cooperate more closely with the Western powers to deal with the current famine, so there is no longer any hope of the Soviet Union joining the United Food Committee.</p>

<p>[Remodeling Press, Tokyo, 19th Rush Dispatch] Yoshida Shigeru is considering abandoning the formation of the cabinet because Imperial University Professor Tohataseiichi and Ouchi Hyoei both insist that they cannot take the posts of Minister of Agriculture and Director-General of the Economic Stabilization Board because their social policies cannot be implemented. The cabinet formation headquarters announced at 7 pm tonight that the cabinet formation work has fallen into extreme difficulty, and Yoshida may go to the Imperial Palace to resign his mandate to form a cabinet. At 8 pm, it was announced that the situation had slightly changed, that discussions were still underway, and that the final decision had not been reached.</p>
<p>[Remodeling Press, Tokyo, 18th Evening Dispatch] The most difficult aspect of the Yoshida new cabinet formation work is the lack of a candidate for the position of Minister of Agriculture. Because the most serious problem in Japan today is the food problem. The majority of the Japanese people are on the verge of starvation. If it is not resolved quickly, political stability is difficult to expect, but given the nature of the new cabinet, it is feared that it will be unable to solve serious issues.</p>

<p>[Reuters, Calcutta, 19th] Chittagong, eastern Bengal Province, yesterday saw the first demonstration by Indian Muslims against the British Cabinet Delegation's proposals.

It is expected that Gandhi, Lawrence, and Cripps may need to meet again before the National Congress Executive Committee passes a resolution on the British plan.</p>
<p>[United Press of India, New Delhi, 18th] Gandhi told a group of National Congress Party members today that the British Cabinet Delegation's proposal to organize an Indian Federation includes "the seeds to transform this land of sorrow into a land without sorrow or worry." The delegation can be truly proud of this proposal. Whatever mistakes British rule in India has made, if the delegation's proposals are genuine (which I believe they are), it would be their so-called discharge of their obligations to India.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Amritsar, India, 19th] The Sikh "Shiromani Akali Association" passed a resolution at its meeting yesterday, stating that the British Cabinet Delegation's proposal regarding India's future status places the Sikh people under Muslim rule, harms the interests of the Sikh people, and is completely unsatisfactory to the Sikh people. The association also decided to call on the entire community to unite and hold a mass rally on the 26th to protest.</p>

<p>[Agence France-Presse, Hamburg, 18th] The British Control Commission recently issued a public statement saying that incidents of looting food have occurred repeatedly in the British-occupied zone of Germany for several weeks, especially in Essen in the Ruhr district. Residents of the area have not seen potatoes since April, and they wait for food trucks to pass by and then loot them. First, they damage the railroad tracks, and when the train approaches the city, they force the driver to drive slowly. Hundreds of people then rush into the train and seize potatoes and other food, throwing them to the men, women, and children lined up along the tracks. In Duisburg, there were three incidents of food looting in one day. Police opened fire, killing one person and injuring several others. German police and British military authorities are cooperating to organize mobile units to protect the Ruhr district's railways. One hundred people have been arrested.</p>

<p>[United Press, Paris, 18th] The campaign for members of the new constituent assembly officially began at midnight today throughout France. Having felt the pain of defeat in the recent referendum on the constitutional draft, the Communist Party has launched a full-force, organized offensive, seeking to remain the single strongest party in the new constituent assembly. The Communist Party originally held 151 seats. In terms of elections, they have already lost ground to the Socialist Party. The Socialist Party not only rejected the Communist Party's proposal for a joint election campaign but also launched a media offensive, publishing articles questioning the extent of their "democracy." This is the right-wing's response to the Communist Party's claim that Communist leader Thorez should be prime minister.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 17th] Following President Truman's announcement that the United Nations Atomic Energy Commission will hold its first meeting on June 14, the United States today proposed to the United Nations the establishment of a permanent Atomic Economic Effects Sub-Committee. The United States suggested at a meeting of the Economic and Employment Committee of the Economic and Social Council that the sub-committee should conduct its work separately from the existing Atomic Energy Commission. The U.S. plan was proposed by the U.S. representative to the Economic and Employment Committee, Mr. Ruzui. The committee did not immediately take action on his proposal. According to the U.S. plan, the sub-committee will keep the permanent UN Economic and Employment Committee regularly informed of the industrial and agricultural possibilities of atomic energy and its possible effects on world economic stability and full employment. Americans believe that the development of atomic energy, especially as a source of productivity, will cause major changes in industry and agriculture, which may affect the future of the world economy. Therefore, it should be constantly studied, especially its effects on coal and oil in industry.</p>

<h3 id="e70">Tram Strike: Deadlock; Labor and Management Tend Towards Extremes; Director Zhao Talks About Two Factions Among Employees; If Work Is Not Resumed Today, Forceful Execution Will Be Implemented <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The British-owned tram company's tram cars, both rail and trackless, were still not running yesterday. Although the Bureau of Social Affairs sent a decree ordering the employees to resume work first, it was not accepted. Yesterday morning, the Mediation Section of the police department sent personnel to mediate. The labor side demanded that the several thousand field employees should receive the same ten yuan basic salary increase as the hundred or so staff members. After this opinion was conveyed to the person in charge of the management side, it was firmly rejected, stating that they would rather stop operating. The union then convened an emergency board of directors meeting in the afternoon. The majority expressed that since the management had made this statement, they were forced to leave for the sake of their livelihoods and could even accept retirement pay. Both sides were in a stalemate, and the future development was not optimistic.</p>
<p>According to Zhao Zengjue, director of the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau, speaking to reporters: the bureau has held negotiations with company officials and employee representatives, "If they do not resume work today (referring to yesterday), forceful execution will be implemented tomorrow (that is, today)." Zhao also said: This labor dispute seems very complicated. According to investigations, employees can be roughly divided into two factions: one is the local faction, and the other is the Jiangbei faction. The local faction is quite willing to resume work, but is opposed by the Jiangbei faction, so they cannot reach a consensus. On the evening of the 17th, the Public Utilities Bureau and the tram company reached an agreement with several employee representatives to continue working on the morning of the 18th. Unexpectedly, after several trams were dispatched, a group of people who did not know the true situation beat and prevented some of the staff from proceeding. According to preliminary investigations, it is heard that these assailants are not employees of the company. The authorities are currently trying to investigate. Regarding the increase in low salaries, the Executive Yuan has issued an order that employee salaries have already been adjusted according to the cost of living index, and basic salaries cannot be further increased. Therefore, the relevant authorities and the company are currently discussing whether to re-determine the grades to improve treatment.</p>

<p>The work slowdown by employees of the Jianghai Customs has not yet been resolved as of yesterday. The Customs authorities are still insisting on resuming work first before negotiations can begin. In addition, yesterday was a scheduled Sunday holiday, and most offices were closed, so there was no negotiation. The situation is still at a standstill and needs to be seen what develops today. It is tending toward a larger scale.</p>
<p>The fishmongers' strike has lasted for many days. After multiple mediations, an agreement has been reached on the elimination of foreign helpers and the competition for four-wheeled carts and trucks. Therefore, they officially announced yesterday that they would resume business, and all vendors are making three times their usual profit.</p>
<p>Regarding the labor dispute in the Western clothing industry, although the management has resumed business, the labor side has not yet resumed work and is still awaiting negotiations for a resolution.</p>

<p>The Municipal Police Bureau believes that labor unrest in the city continues to arise. If this stalemate persists, it will hinder social order. A special order was issued to all branch bureaus to find ways to prevent it. The original text is roughly as follows: Rice prices are soaring, and public sentiment is uneasy, which is why labor unrest is rising and falling. Most factory employees are doing this for the sake of their livelihoods, which is understandable. However, there are a few petty criminals who are taking the opportunity to make trouble. From now on, each branch bureau should find ways to prevent labor unrest from expanding and affecting social order.</p>
<h3 id="e73">Three Thousand Street Cleaners Demand Improved Treatment: Slogans Pasted on Brooms, A Grand Procession; Supervising Authorities Persuade to Resume Work <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>More than three thousand street cleaners in this city, demanding improved treatment, went on strike the day before yesterday and marched to the Sanitation Bureau to petition. Since they did not get results, they gathered more than a thousand people yesterday morning, each carrying a broom with slogans pasted on it. They paraded grandly from Hongkou, via Bazi Road, Henan Road, Nanjing Road, to the Bureau of Social Affairs on Linsen Road to petition. However, yesterday was Sunday, and the Bureau of Social Affairs was closed, so they did not get what they wanted. By the afternoon, this broom parade dispersed. In addition, the person in charge of the cleaning team of the Municipal Sanitation Bureau issued a statement yesterday regarding the street cleaners' strike: Recently, prices in the city have been rising sharply, and labor unrest in various industries has been arising in waves. The street cleaners live a hard life and cannot avoid being affected by it. They should know that street cleaners are employees hired by the government, which is completely different from ordinary labor-management relations. If there are reasonable requests, they should follow proper channels, and they will never be allowed to coerce with strike tactics. Some street cleaners previously requested to organize a trade union. At that time, the Sanitation Bureau did not approve it because it was not in accordance with the provisions of the Trade Union Law. Furthermore, regarding the remuneration of street cleaners, the team has been handling it in accordance with municipal government regulations. The basic salary for street cleaners in April was 35 yuan, and for garbage collectors, it was 45 yuan, plus a cost-of-living allowance of 40,000 yuan and a rice subsidy of 12,000 yuan, for a total of 52,035 yuan per street cleaner and 52,045 yuan per garbage collector. They have already been issued clearly. The rice subsidy for May increased by 20,000 yuan per person, so street cleaners each receive 60,035 yuan, and garbage collectors receive 60,045 yuan. According to regulations, they are not issued 160 times the increased amount. The bureau has adjusted the amount of living expenses from time to time, so it lists the amount to be issued each time when issuing wages and distributes it to various locations for public notice to show credibility. After this incident occurred, Director Yu was very angry and gave strict instructions, limiting the time to resume work. The division, in addition to the respective supervisors being responsible for guiding, and making statements on the lives of the street cleaners upwards to the authorities for a comprehensive adjustment, deeply hopes that all the street cleaners will appreciate the difficult times and resume work immediately.</p>

<h3 id="e77">China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Jiangya Steamer Transferred to Shanghai-Ningbo Route; First Voyage Scheduled for the Day After Tomorrow <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company previously leased the Zhoushan Steamer to operate the Shanghai-Ningbo route. The Zhoushan Company has now taken back the ship for its own use and is operating the Fuzhou route, also calling at Wanningbo. It made its first voyage from Shanghai to Ningbo and Fuzhou last Friday. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Ningbo route has been suspended due to this. However, there are many passengers on the Shanghai-Ningbo route, and the cargo transport in eastern Zhejiang is also very important. Although there are still the Zhoushan and Dahua steamers operating, the Zhoushan steamer also calls at Wanning, so the sailing schedule is longer. The Dahua steamer suffered mechanical damage on its last voyage from Ningbo to Shanghai and is currently under repair. Therefore, there is a great need for a ship on the Shanghai-Ningbo route. Therefore, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company immediately transferred the Jiangya steamer to the Shanghai-Ningbo route. The ship has a gross tonnage of over 3,000 tons, similar to the former Xinjiangtian, and also has many passenger seats. It has now been newly painted and is scheduled to cast off at 3:00 PM on the 22nd (Tuesday). The ship will dock at the Jinliyuan Wharf. The Jiangya steamer was originally planned to call at Zhenhai when it operates the Shanghai-Ningbo route. However, it is now learned that it is inconvenient for the ship to turn around and dock because the ship is large, and due to time constraints, it will temporarily not call at Zhenhai and will go directly to Ningbo.</p>

<p>[Report from this newspaper] The re-election of municipal senators in the 9th (Changning) and 19th (Yulin) districts was completed yesterday in a calm atmosphere. For the sake of prudence, the Civil Affairs Department of the municipal government specially dispatched Li Xuexun, section chief of the third section, and Chen Pu, section chief of the second section, to the two districts to preside over the election supervision. In addition, additional polling places were set up in the two districts, six in the 9th district and seven in the 19th district. Two representatives and one supervisor were assigned to each polling place, and there were also patrol officers and police officers to maintain order. From 7:00 AM, the voters in the two districts went to the polling places with their national ID cards to collect ballots. Therefore, the order of voting and elections throughout the day was good. There were candidates in the two districts who sent people to post slogans, but the election mood was not as enthusiastic and chaotic as the first time. After the voting time ended at 7:00 PM, the ballots were counted separately in the two districts. The number of votes in each district was around 30,000, and the counting ended around 11:00 PM.

<h3 id="e79">Indian Seal Carving Expert Gao Tianxin Talks About Art <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Gao Tianxin, an expert in Indian seal carving, and his wife, Zang Manjun, have carved seals for many years in Zhejiang, Nanjing, Chengdu, Chongqing, and other places, earning a remarkable reputation. They have come to Shanghai this time and plan to continue selling seals. Yesterday, he had a conversation with reporters about the art of seal carving. Gao has been carving seals for 20 years. He began studying at the age of 13 and began selling his works at the age of 14. His father, Gao Yingsan, was a famous brick engraver and seal carver. Gao said that the difference between a stone engraver and an ordinary seal carver is that ordinary seal carvers do not study seal script and knife techniques. Most people like to carve seals with precious ivory, crystal, or metal, but in reality, stone seals are the best to express exquisite skills. The smallest seals can be carved on materials as thick as a matchstick, but in terms of results, the larger the area, the better the technique can be expressed. In order to preserve and promote national essence, Gao has decided to make seal carving his lifelong career. Gao's wife is also proficient in this skill. The seals she carves are generous and powerful, truly expressing her strong personality. In the summer of 1941, Gao witnessed Japanese planes bombing Chengdu and carved two seals, which he presented to former US President Roosevelt. He attached a letter calling for aid from the perspective of the people, and received a letter of thanks from President Roosevelt's representative in the US Department of State. He also created an exhibition of anti-Japanese war seals in Chongqing and Chengdu, which was well-received.</p>

<p>[Our Report] Fan Shunxing, a 47-year-old man from Yangzhou, resides at No. 14 Bulin Lane, Jinling Road. He is currently a foreman at Datong Shipping Company and Dada Wharf, etc. He owns assets and has three wives and concubines, appearing to be a wealthy man. During the enemy puppet period, he served as a special agent under Wu Shibao, a murderous devil, acting as an accomplice and oppressing the good people, committing all kinds of evils. Pan Shirong and his wife, who lived at No. 20 Juqing Lane, Xinzha Road, were once deceived to the Paramount Ballroom and falsely accused of being underground workers. They were imprisoned in "No. 76" for 68 days. After the victory, Pan once filed a lawsuit with the court, but Fan refused to be summoned and disappeared. Unexpectedly, around 11:00 AM yesterday, the plaintiff Mrs. Pan met Fan on Jinling Road. The victims met on a narrow road, so she grabbed Fan's collar and called the police. Fan was taken to the Huangpu Police Station and is currently being strictly interrogated by the Criminal Division of the branch.</p>
<h3 id="e87">Ma Yinchu Gives a Public Speech, His Eloquent Words Move People, Read More Books and Look Less at Money, Claims He Could Do Business If He Were Shameless <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>[Our Report] Dr. Ma Yinchu, a famous Chinese economist, gave his first public speech in Shanghai yesterday morning at 10:00 AM at the Ningbo Compatriots Association at the invitation of the Lixin Alumni Association. First, Pan Xulun, the principal of Lixin Accounting School, gave a brief introduction, followed by Mr. Ma speaking amidst the enthusiastic applause of more than a thousand listeners. He first said that China had always adopted single-entry bookkeeping, but since Pan Xulun advocated double-entry bookkeeping, it has recently achieved success, so Mr. Pan can be regarded as the pioneer of accounting in China. He then said that the living conditions in the rear were vastly different from those in Shanghai. Sichuan is a large place, but the food is very poor. Public school teachers eat rotten rice. According to what Mr. Ma knew, there were as many as 74 ways for rice merchants to cheat. The most shocking one was that Jiangyun rice merchants often mixed powder ground from the bones of dead people into the rice, and then watered it, so the rice would swell and the weight would increase. Inspectors often walked barefoot on the rice. If their feet felt itchy, it was certain that there were dead people's bones in the rice. The rice transporters only needed to hear the inspector say "itchy feet" to know that the fraud had been exposed. This rice can still be used for meals after washing, but such methods are probably unimaginable to Shanghai people. As for clothing, people in the countryside often wear new clothes, while public school teachers are poor. Some places do not have electric lights and use tung oil lamps instead. The smoke is heavy and the light is dim, making it especially difficult to read and write. However, every time I think about the soldiers on the front lines, whose difficulties are even deeper than those in the rear, I feel at peace.</p>
<p>The lack of books is also a major difficulty. Some books are stored deep and secret due to bombing prevention, and cannot be read by the public. But the staff and students in the rear still work hard. Mr. Ma said with a very sighing tone: "If I were shameless, why couldn't I do business?" But I still sit and watch the vulgar merchants and profiteers get rich. It is said that many difficulties can rejuvenate the country. "Scholars" are the pioneers of society and must not go with the tide.</p>
<p>Mr. Ma continued: There is pleasure in reading. We should sacrifice material enjoyment. Shanghai has not made any progress in morality and thought during the eight years of the Anti-Japanese War. "Everywhere is money, money, money, money, money!" Most people only know how to do calculations all day long, but they do not know that people must have "personality" and need to do something and achieve something. Otherwise, what is the point of living a life of labor! If a person has no lofty purpose, then this person is not worth taking. Religious figures create the world, which is actually a "man-made world." We should read books and study science on the one hand, and on the other hand, we should also create civilization in terms of morality and spirit. From this, we can see the importance of philosophy. We should stand in our own positions, do our best to teach, do our best to read, and work for the country. We must know that reading is not easy in China. More than 90% of the people in the country are illiterate.</p>
<p>In life, looking at Shanghai on the one hand and looking at the countryside on the other hand, we can know that our living standards in Shanghai are far above those of "country people." In the countryside, sometimes even bran cannot be eaten. If you don't go to the plains, how can you know the high mountains! Therefore, it is said that learning should look upwards, and life should look downwards. Studying is for learning, and no great scholar in the world studies for money.</p>

<p>[Our Report] Cheng Kangfu, a 31-year-old man from Anhui Province, who works in a bank, lives on the front floor of No. 1 Heming Lane, Pu'an Road, Ninghai Road. Cheng married a woman from his hometown, Mrs. Zai, many years ago. They have been married for eight years and have two sons, the elder named Zhenhong (7 years old) and the younger named Zhenxi (3 years old). Unexpectedly, Cheng had an affair with a woman named Zhu Baoyuan, who lived at No. 12 Junle Village, Zhongzheng Road. As time went on, the affair was exposed and discovered by his wife. She remonstrated in vain. Mrs. Zai, in a fit of anger, found four opium pipes the night before and attempted to commit suicide with her whole family. She swallowed two pipes herself and divided the remaining pipes to her two children. Fortunately, the eldest son, Zhenhong, tasted something strange after eating and immediately spat it into the spittoon. The younger child, Zhenxi, was young and ignorant and swallowed a pipe. After taking the poison, the mother and children closed the door and went to bed, preparing to die. As a result, apart from Zhenhong being safe and sound, Mrs. Zai and her younger son Zhenxi had an attack of poison at dawn. Their groans reached the outside. The neighbors noticed and broke into the house. They saw that the mother and son were in abnormal condition. They quickly reported to the Taishan Police Station and summoned an ambulance. They were rushed to the hospital for treatment. The younger son, Zhenxi, died in the hospital at 4:00 PM.</p>

<p>Liquid fuels such as kerosene and gasoline have been shipped to Shanghai by Mobil, Texaco and other oil companies, providing a large supply to the market. People who hoard them see that there is no profit to be made and sell them one after another, causing the black market to plummet and nearing complete elimination. At present, the supply of gasoline and kerosene has returned to the state before the war. They can be purchased everywhere. In addition, the price of liquid fuel is cheaper than coal and charcoal, so citizens are competing to buy and use them. Therefore, the sales of firewood and charcoal are not as good as in the past.</p>

<p>Refugees Must Register and Be Accommodated First</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Zhenjiang News] The Jiangsu Youth Resumption of School and Employment Assistance Office of the Ministry of Education previously contacted Xuzhou Normal School, Wuhu Vocational Training Class, and Shanghai Teacher Training Institute to send students, but all three locations were unable to accommodate them due to limited quotas, resulting in refugees wandering in Zhenjiang, at a loss. In order to start work and solve the students' schooling problem, the office has added a Zhenjiang Teacher Training Institute and a Taixian Middle School Refresher Class, in addition to the class levels and quotas stipulated by the general association, in response to the urgent needs of the province. The office previously sent specialists Hang Yanfu and Cao Yuan to be responsible for preparations. The Taixian Middle School Refresher Class has determined the original site of Taizhou Vocational School and Jiao De Middle School as the class site, and is currently fixing it. There are many locations for the Zhenjiang Teacher Training Institute, but all the buildings are damaged, and it will take a lot of money and time to repair them. The budget has now been completed and submitted to the general association for approval. Because the refugee students lack food and clothing, in order to provide urgent relief, students assigned to the Taizhou Middle School Refresher Class and the Zhenjiang Teacher Training Institute will begin to register at the office from the 10th of this month and will be accommodated in the institute on the 7th and 8th. Among the students who have dropped out of school in Zhenjiang, 128 have been assigned to the Taizhou Middle School Refresher Class and 248 to the Zhenjiang Teacher Training Institute. According to Niu Jianchu, director of the office, the office's work in the past three months has focused on the relief and assistance of out-of-school youth. In the future, the office will also consider the employment assistance of unemployed youth, in order to increase the number of students returning to school and reduce the number of unemployed youth.

<p>[Dahua News Agency Nanchang News] The Jiangxi Provincial Health Education Association, in view of the fact that the school buildings of public and private schools at all levels in the provincial capital were mostly ravaged by the enemy during the occupation period and were severely damaged, and due to funding and time constraints after the restoration, they could not be repaired completely in a short time, and could only barely function, so the school environment generally could not pay attention to hygiene, which had a profound impact on students' health. Now that summer has arrived and diseases are rampant, and schools are public places, it is easier to spread diseases. Therefore, the association has jointly organized a provincial public and private school environmental hygiene competition with the Provincial Anti-epidemic Brigade and the Health Office, which started on the 10th of this month and will end on the 10th of June. The competition standards include ten scoring items: the surrounding conditions of the school buildings, classrooms, hygiene rooms, teacher's offices, kitchens, rooms, drinks, sports fields, toilets, and garbage disposal.</p>

On average, each student can get 7,000 yuan for meals. It is now planned to sell 60 million yuan of the 80,000 dan of accumulated grain allocated last year to make up for the deficit. (2) The provincial social education funding has been completely cut, which is why the West Lake Museum, the Provincial Library, and the People's Education Center are teetering on the brink. The museum sells tickets, and the auditorium of the Hangzhou People's Education Center is rented out for that reason. (3) The education restoration fund is approved at 200 million yuan, which is why the Provincial Women's Middle School and the People's Education Practice School cannot be restored at present. (4) The local education funding in various counties is also very difficult, with no way to raise funds. It has been decided to rename it as a subsidy. (5) All schools also feel the pain of not being able to receive education funding on time. It is now heard that the provincial middle schools, due to funding difficulties, are difficult to maintain and plan to end the semester early in mid-June. (Shou)</p>
<h3 id="e110">The Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry Plan to Revive National Aquatic Schools, the Executive Yuan Allocates 26 Fishing Vessels <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>There is a Rumor That Lianyungang Aquatic School Will Move to Shanghai</p>
<p>[This City News] After eight years of the Anti-Japanese War, most of the original schools in coastal areas that cultivated aquatic and fishery technology were destroyed. The Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry is seeking to revive them and has obtained the assistance of the Executive Yuan to decide to rebuild them. Yesterday, a Datong News Agency reporter learned from personnel of the Executive Yuan that the office has concrete plans for the revival of national aquatic schools. In addition to the fishing vessels supplied by the United States and Australia, there is also a lot of relevant technical information. The Ministry of Agriculture will also rebuild the destroyed schools. The following list shows a glimpse:</p>
<p>(Location) (School) (Survival Status) (Allocated Vessels)</p>
<p>Shanghai Wusong Aquatic School Completely Destroyed Six</p>
<p>Fuhai Zhejiang Provincial Aquatic School Half Destroyed Two</p>
<p>Fuzhou Fujian Provincial Aquatic School Destroyed Two</p>
<p>Xiamen Jimei Aquatic School Exists Two</p>
<p>Yantai Shandong Aquatic School Closed Two</p>
<p>Tianjin Hebei Provincial Aquatic Technical College Exists Three</p>
<p>Yingkou Liaoning Aquatic Technical College Newly Received Two</p>
<p>Shanwei Guangdong Maritime School Not Detailed</p>
<p>Lianyungang Jiangsu Provincial Lianyungang Junior Aquatic School To Be Moved Two</p>
<p>Kaohsiung Taiwan Provincial Aquatic School Newly Received Two</p>
<p>Qingdao National Fisheries and Salt Experiment Field Exists One</p>
<p>In addition to those recently received, most of those that exist are only the buildings. As for the internal furniture, equipment, books, and instruments, they have all been lost, and the losses are very heavy. The Executive Yuan has allocated a total of 26 fishing vessels to various schools, which will be realized soon. It is also learned that there is a proposal to move the Lianyungang school to Shanghai. It has not yet been determined whether the school will be used as the foundation for the restoration of Wusong Aquatic School and is currently being planned by the Ministry of Agriculture.</p>
<h3 id="e111">American Education Fund to Subsidize Black Children <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>[American News Agency Washington, 18th] The Senate Education and Labor Committee yesterday passed a bill on federal education subsidies, so that all famous doctors in the country have equal educational opportunities. The bill stipulates that the federal government will spend $150 million in the first year, $200 million in the second year, and $250 million each year thereafter. The distribution of funds is based on a mathematical formula, proportional to the number of children in a state and inversely proportional to the state's financial strength. Under this method, it is estimated that 33 states, including the southern states, will receive this subsidy. Senator Taft estimates that most of the funds will be used to subsidize black children in the South. The bill expressly stipulates that these funds shall not be used for capital construction, ensuring that most of the funds will be used to raise teachers' salaries.</p>
<h3 id="e112">Each County Should Have Five or More Central National Schools Designated as Demonstration Schools with Substantial Content to Allow Other Schools to Observe and Learn <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Nanjing News] During the Anti-Japanese War, the Ministry of Education promulgated the first five-year plan for the implementation of national education nationwide in Chongqing, ordering provinces and cities in the rear to implement it. Therefore, after the victory, provinces and cities were again ordered to implement the second five-year plan, in order to achieve one central national school in each township and one national school in each bao. However, during the eight years of the Anti-Japanese War, the financial resources of the provinces in the rear were also affected by the war. Although the number of national schools has increased over the years, the equipment and content are inevitably simple. In the war zones, due to the destruction of school buildings and equipment by the enemy puppets, it is even more difficult to immediately fully restore the old appearance due to the excessive damage and the lack of economic strength in the current education restoration. It is heard that the Ministry of Education, mindful of this, has formulated a compromise approach to adapt to the current situation. What is the approach? That is, within this year, each county under each province should designate at least five to ten or more central national schools as demonstration area schools, giving priority to enriching the content and all the equipment of these schools to establish a model, so that other schools in the county and city can learn from this impression, and promote progress. It is also heard that the Ministry of Education will issue a notice to the education departments and bureaus of all provinces and cities to strictly comply with it. (Yu)</p>
<h3 id="e113">Seven Major Japanese Newspapers to Publish Some News in Roman Letters <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>[Associated Press Tokyo, 19th] Japan's seven largest newspapers, which together reach a circulation of 8.66 million copies, are now preparing and expressing their willingness to publish part of the news in Roman letters, but on the condition that certain problems are solved. Simplifying Japanese characters is the first practical step in accordance with the recommendations of the American educational mission to Japan. The realization of this innovative step now hinges on the following three points: (1) The Japanese government must give Roman letters an official format. (2) It is expected that the part of the news published in Roman letters will be difficult for readers to understand before they are accustomed to the new type of writing, so the newspapers themselves should establish an agreement on the amount of Roman letters used. (3) A definite format for Roman letters should be prescribed.</p>

<p>Discussing Difficult Issues in Civil Education</p>
<p>[This City News] The Municipal National Education Demonstration Area convened a civil education seminar at the Qingning Temple Office at 2:00 pm yesterday. More than a dozen teachers from civil education classes in various schools attended, chaired by Director Lu. He explained that after the municipal elementary schools were renamed national schools, civil education work became more important, because national schools include both the elementary school department and the civil education department. If there is no civil education class, it will not be a national school. He hoped that all schools could find ways to overcome the difficulties in running civil education, so that the work of eliminating illiteracy could achieve satisfactory results. Then, various schools reported on the current situation of running civil education classes and raised practical difficulties, such as enrollment, retention, teaching materials, and moral education. They jointly discussed solutions, and the office printed and distributed methods for setting up civil education classes for reference by various schools.</p>

<p>The second Respect for Teachers Movement Football Charity Match was held at the Yiyuan Stadium at 3:00 pm yesterday. Nearly 10,000 spectators attended. The Shanghai Refugee and Orphan Shelter Band played at the venue, and the atmosphere was enthusiastic. As a result, Donghua defeated Western Union 3-1, and the Old and Strong Team defeated the Reporter Team 2-0.</p>
<p>Old Men's Game</p>
<p>Old and Strong Wins</p>
<p>The opening act, the old men's game between Old and Strong and the sports reporters, started at exactly 3:00 pm. Zhou Jun of Old and Strong did not arrive, and Qu Xigen played as a guest. Because Ma Youyu, Hu Daozhang, Zhang Guochun and other generals from the reporters had just returned from Wuxi, they were tired and exhausted, and their performance was inferior. Moreover, Ma and Hu were injured before the battle, which made them feel stretched. Referee Huang Renyi blew the whistle to start the game, and Old and Strong launched an all-out attack. Wang Weijun and Qian Xucang were like tigers, and the reporters' position was greatly threatened. After five minutes, Xu Huanming shot, hitting the crossbar and bouncing down. Qian Xucang headed the ball, Shi Nizhong fumbled, and Wang Weijun lightly shot it in. The reporters were unwilling and launched a large-scale attack, but the defense of Old and Strong was tight, and it was difficult to succeed. After a long time of melee, Old and Strong came back strongly, and the five forwards attacked in a ring. Shi Nizhong left the goal, and Liao Shun caught the ball. Qian Xucang waited in the right position and shot into the empty goal. The reporters quickly replaced Shi Nizhong with Qu Yaokang. Qu performed with the attitude of McNeety without any mistakes. Soon, the first half ended, and Old and Strong took the lead 2-0. After the change of sides, the reporters Zhang Guochun and Feng Xiaoxiu entered the arena, replacing Qu Yaokang and Di Xianzhang. Old and Strong still tried their best to attack, but fortunately the reporters defended well and did not lose any more goals. In the last ten minutes, the reporters' fortunes turned around, and the offensive became stronger, but the good opportunity was lost, and they could only sigh helplessly. When the time was up, Old and Strong defeated the reporters 2-0.</p>
<p>Main Battle</p>
<p>Donghua Wins Again</p>
<p>At exactly 4:00 pm, the main battle began. Donghua met Western Union again. Jia Youliang and Song Lingsheng of Donghua made a mistake, and Han Longgen and Sun Huiwen played. Referee Deng Xiaoliang and Mayor Qian held the opening ceremony, and the contact began immediately. Donghua's offensive was very strong. After ten minutes, Han Longgen headed the ball and scored the first goal. Western Union tried to retaliate. After 25 minutes, Fafan Xiao did not fail his mission and swept the net. The first half ended with a tie of 1-1. After the change of sides, the lineup of Western Union was slightly adjusted. The five forwards entered the Donghua hinterland, but gained nothing. After 20 minutes, Han Longhai got the ball from the right and shot it out of thin air. Donghua raised his head again. After six minutes, Longhai and Longgen advanced side by side, and Longgen was inspired and made another great contribution. Until the end of the game, Donghua defeated Western Union again with a score of 3-1. The lineups of the four teams are as follows:</p>
<p>Old and Strong Zhou Jiaqi, E Sen, Ma Qingyuan, Qu Xirong, Zhang Le, Qu Xigen, Qian Xucang, Yue Xiurong, Wang Weijun, Xu Huanming, Ding Shunbin.</p>

<h3 id="e121">Gold and Banknotes Turn from Stable to Rising, Rice Prices Soar Unprecedentedly, Public Bonds and Stocks Both Decline, Yarn, Cotton, and Silk See Mixed Gains and Losses <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>Among the financial items last week, only the exchange rate of US banknotes was particularly attractive. The vitality of stocks and bonds was sharply reduced. On the commodity side, due to rising prices in the producing areas of rice and the manipulation of large households, the market was unbalanced, creating unprecedented high prices. The situation of each industry is recorded below.</p>
<p>Gold</p>
<p>The trend of gold was stable and slightly upward. With the resumption of the blue-collar stock market indefinite, people were idle, resulting in frequent speculative purchases. Furthermore, the purchasing power of people in various rural areas was very strong. On Monday, it stood firm outside the 1.8 million mark. On Wednesday, the Bank of China's allocation price was 1.73 million, and it secretly absorbed the supply. The foundation was weak, so the final price retreated to 1.725 million. On Thursday and Friday, out-of-town silverware shops absorbed the supply, and the market rose again, reaching 1.8 million. On Saturday, it continued to rise to a peak of 1.92 million.</p>
<p>Foreign Currency</p>
<p>The Bank of China's telegraphic transfer rate for US dollars remained unchanged at 2020. The US dollar fluctuates with the rise and fall of gold prices. On Monday, when the gold price was high at 1.87 million, importers were very willing to accept it, and it once rose from 2280 to 2460 yuan, but then retreated to 2240 yuan. From Tuesday to Thursday, it hovered around 2300 yuan. By Saturday, when gold rose outside the 1.9 million mark, it rose from 2320 to 2400 yuan, and finally to 2410 yuan. The Hong Kong dollar fluctuated slightly. On Monday, it stood at 415 yuan. It once retreated to 400 yuan, but by Saturday it still stood at 415 yuan.</p>
<p>Consolidated Bonds</p>
<p>Rumors of bond redemption have dissipated, and people are calm. Bullish traders are not active, and there has been a surge in selling bonds and buying gold throughout the week. At the beginning of the week, Class C bonds were still hovering at 7200 yuan, but on Friday they fell below 7000 yuan. The final price at the weekend was 6600 yuan. Classes A, B, and D bonds initially traded at 4200 yuan, but also retreated to 3400 or 3500 yuan. Class E bonds retreated from 4500 or 4600 yuan to 3600 or 3700 yuan.</p>
<p>Chinese Stocks</p>
<p>Black market trading was sluggish. Due to the lack of public trading, it was difficult to be active, and the transaction volume was limited. In particular, there was a lack of interest in unpopular stocks, and the transaction volume of popular stocks was also small. Wing On Textile rose after falling. It fell to 4950 on Monday, rose to 5200 on Thursday, and remained around 5200 on Saturday after news of dividend payments. Mei Ya hovered at 4100 or 4200 yuan, closing at 4100 at the weekend. Three small-scale stocks were initially vibrant, hovering in the middle, but ultimately declined. Jingfu fell from 335 yuan to 310 yuan, Xin Guang fell from 275 yuan to 250 yuan, Qin Xing fell from 345 yuan to 225 yuan, pharmacies and underwear remained at 180 yuan, matches fell from 1150 to 1100 yuan, medicines remained around 80 yuan, Xin He fell from 700 yuan to 670 yuan, Zhong Fang Xian experienced both prosperity and decline, and Rong Feng fell from 1250 yuan to 1100 yuan.</p>
<p>Foreign Stocks</p>
<p>Foreign stocks also saw false optimism last week. Few stocks showed improvement, and the trend gradually declined. Only on Thursday, when the money supply eased, did they strengthen slightly after weakening. Jardine Textile fell from 13,200 to 12,000 yuan, English and Allied fell from 12,200 to 11,400, Yeguang fell from 4700 to 4200, Wheelock fell from 20,000 to 19,200, Jardine Brewery fell from 2800 to 2500, Shipping fell from 2100 to 1950, and Iron and Steel fell from 3300 to 2950. Among them, the paper industry experienced relatively stable fluctuations, from 2150 on Monday to a closing price of 2250 yuan on Saturday.</p>
<p>Rice and Grain</p>
<p>At the beginning of the week, the rice market was stable due to the large amount of goods arriving. Flour was also stable due to the impact of grain prices. In terms of miscellaneous grains, soybeans continued to rise by more than 1,000 yuan. Raw peanuts saw mixed gains and losses. Edible oil supply and demand were equal, and the price was similar to that of last Saturday. People were optimistic about sugar, and it rose by about 10%. On Tuesday, rice prices rose sharply again as demand became active in all areas, with increases ranging from 3,000 to 4,000 yuan. Flour rose slightly by 700 or 800 yuan. Among miscellaneous grains, soybeans remained stable, raw peanuts saw mixed gains and losses, the edible oil market remained stable, and sugar continued to rise due to high demand. On Wednesday, the rise in rice prices did not stop. Yin rice was the sharpest, rising by 3,000 yuan due to scarcity of goods, while the rest rose by 500 to 1,000 yuan. Flour fell slightly, miscellaneous grains saw mixed gains and losses, edible oil sales were sluggish and fell by more than 1,000 yuan, and sugar fell sharply due to speculators selling for profit, with medium sugar falling by as much as 10,000 yuan. On Thursday, rice prices still hovered and remained firm. White japonica and foreign indica rice rose by 1,000 yuan, while white rice was slightly higher by 2,000 yuan. The flour market was stable, with only dozens of yuan of fluctuations. Miscellaneous grains saw mixed gains and losses, the edible oil market was slightly depressed and continued to fall by about 1,000 yuan, and the sugar market turned firm, with Xinghua white being the most sought after. On Friday, rice prices continued to rise by 4,000 to 5,000 yuan as inventories dwindled and retail sales were active. Flour also rose by more than 1,000 yuan due to the high price of rice. Among miscellaneous grains, soybeans were exported and rose by more than 1,000 yuan, raw peanuts were mediocre, the edible oil market was normal with only 1,000 yuan of fluctuations, and both supply and demand for sugar were scarce, and the market tended to be stable. On Saturday, although the rice supply was smooth, the price increase became more and more intense. Japonica and indica rice both exceeded the 60,000 yuan mark, an increase of 7,000 to 8,000 yuan compared to yesterday. Flour also rose by 1,000 yuan. Among miscellaneous grains, soybeans rose by 2,000 to 4,000 yuan due to the rise in oil prices, and the rest also rose in unison. Edible oil rose sharply due to the influx of hot money, rising by about 10,000 yuan. The sugar market was flat.</p>
<p>Raw Yarn</p>
<p>In the past week, the initial trend was very mediocre. After Wednesday, the actual sales of raw yarn from Tianjin, Guangdong, and the mainland were brisk. Fine yarn was also under the control of the Textile Construction Company, and there were rumors of shortages in the market. The amount of available yarn was dwindling, and the soaring prices of gold and rice made the weekend's rise even more intense, with peaks emerging one after another. The highest for the entire week was 2.45 million for 42-count Blue Phoenix on Saturday, and the lowest was 750,000 for 10-count Double Cat on Tuesday. The difference between the highest and lowest was 1.7 million. In terms of counts, 42-count Blue Phoenix soared by 530,000 compared to the previous week, 40-count of the same brand rose by 410,000, and 32-count Double Twist Fairy Peach rose by 500,000. The increase in yarns of 20 counts and below was very slow due to the relatively large supply. Double Horse rose by 95,000, and 16 and 10 counts only rose by 30,000 or 50,000.</p>
<p>Cloth Market</p>
<p>The market was filled with foreign goods, and buyers from other provinces made ordinary purchases. Most traders were watching and waiting, and the market showed no progress. Grey twill was widely used for making children's clothing and umbrellas, and the situation was the most popular, rising by 4,000 yuan. The remaining items, such as Shihlin drill, 12-pound fine cloth, and 16-pound coarse cloth, only rose by 1,000 or 2,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Cotton Market</p>
<p>The Textile Construction Company did not make any purchases during the week. Private yarn factories such as Shenxin, Sulun, Dasheng, Xinsheng, Minfeng, Fuan, and Xinyu all had considerable needs, and the market was relatively stable, rising by about 2,000 or 3,000 yuan compared to before.</p>
<p>Silk</p>
<p>During the past week, the total loss of 120-count Tianqiao bright artificial silk was about 60,000 or 70,000 yuan. It was 60,000 yuan higher than the previous weekend, and then it gradually declined. This was mainly because Zhongfang released a large amount of goods at prices cheaper than the market price, and the price of Tianqiao also followed suit. On Saturday of last week, Zhongfang opened 1.12 million for 120-count Zhongbiao bright silk, 1.07 million for Black Island bright silk, 1.18 million for Xuhui bright silk, 1.12 million for Toyo semi-bright silk, 1.18 million for 150-count Jinhuanxing bright silk, and 1.18 million for 150-count Jinji semi-bright silk. Given this situation, it is difficult to be optimistic about the price of rayon. The transaction volume of foreign goods by factories and merchants was very low during the week. The average fineness of 81 to 83 points was generally between 2.5 million and 600,000 yuan. The price of medium-grade user silk was between 2 million and 1.95 million yuan, with a fluctuation of 50,000 yuan. The price of dry silk was very stable, always around 1.4 million yuan. The minimum price for American-Asian bedding was 1.11 million yuan, and the maximum was 1.18 million yuan. The price on Monday was similar to that of the weekend. The minimum price for Dacheng plaid was 3,800 yuan, and the maximum was 4,200 yuan. Compared with Monday and the weekend, it was 100 yuan higher.</p>
<p>Hardware</p>
<p>The trend of hardware was stable this week. There were few foreign goods arriving at the port. For domestic goods, the sales of edge yarn were brisk due to the season, and the local inventory was insufficient to meet the demand. Goods were being prepared for shipment to Shanghai. Towns such as Nanyang and the Philippines made large purchases, and the market price was strong. Therefore, factories can still maintain operations. The actual sales of yuan nails were sluggish. For other goods, buyers stopped ordering and watched, and the market was unchanged.</p>
<p>Other</p>
<p>As for other goods, fuel was stable throughout the week, and only a few showed slight softening on Saturday. Only hemp firewood rose by 100 yuan. Daily necessities lacked momentum and remained weak throughout the week. Solid soap was 39,000 yuan at the beginning of the week and 41,000 yuan at the weekend. Beautiful matches were 550,000 yuan at the beginning of the week and 550,000 yuan on Saturday. Other items such as woolen cloth and Chinese medicine were still weak and fluctuating.</p>

<p>100,000 Tons of Corn, Also 90,000 Tons of Rice and Sugar</p>
<p>[Reported by This Newspaper] It has recently been rumored that Brazil has a surplus of 90,000 tons of rice that can be exported. A certain foreign firm in this city is currently selling it. If the transaction is successful, the first batch can be delivered in 40 days. Yesterday, Reuters reported from Rio de Janeiro on the 18th that the Brazilian authorities recently reported that the country's surplus of 8,000,000 tons of corn and rice can slightly alleviate the critical world food shortage. If the surplus grain cannot be shipped due to insufficient transportation, Brazil will keep it for its own use and reduce imports of flour and wheat. It seems that the above news is not without basis.</p>

<p>Rice prices are soaring, and the whole city is in a state of panic. The Ministry of Food previously ordered 300,000 tons of foreign rice from Siam. Last week, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Haitong Wheel left Shanghai for Haiphong to load the rice. The first batch of 7,000 tons has been shipped from there to China and will arrive in Shanghai in a few days. The remaining 190,000 tons of foreign rice are expected to arrive soon. The authorities will also send additional large-scale ships to load the rice.</p>
<h3 id="e125">On the Management of Domestic Remittances: The Purpose Is to Prevent Hot Money from Entering Shanghai <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>[Huadong News Agency] The Central Bank believes that domestic remittances are of great importance to Shanghai's financial and industrial markets. Too much hot money flowing in from other provinces can lead to fluctuations in finance and commodity prices. In order to prevent this trend, the Central Bank is planning to strengthen the management of domestic commercial remittance business. However, the business of domestic commercial remittance is handled by major commercial banks. It is reported that the Central Bank has held preliminary discussions with the Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and other banks.</p>

<p>Amidst the skyrocketing rice prices, fuel prices are the most stable. Recently, the number of coal shipments from Qinhuangdao Kai Coal Mine to Shanghai has increased sharply. They are all evenly distributed to various production institutions by the Fuel Committee. Therefore, coal prices have tended to stabilize. As for the raw material Hongji white coal dust for making coal briquettes, production has recently resumed due to the resolution of the labor strike at the Hongji Coal Mine in Annam. In the past week, three shipments have arrived in Shanghai and have been allocated to various coal briquette factories by the Fuel Committee. As the raw material problem has been solved, production in each factory will be restored to pre-war levels. Therefore, the price of coal briquettes has been declining recently. It once rose to 10,000 yuan per dan, but now each factory is selling at a reduced price of 7,000 yuan.</p>

<p>The Enemy and Puppet Property Handling Bureau has entrusted the Ministry of Food and the Customs to tender for the enemy and puppet miscellaneous grains, corn flour, etc. multiple times.

<p>The relevant authorities in this city have taken over a large number of enemy and puppet automobiles, which are currently stored in the open space on the left side of Qiujiang Road and the Xianle Ballroom on Nanjing Middle Road. The Highway Administration Bureau believes that they have been stored for a long time and are vulnerable to wind and rain. Therefore, it recently put up for tender the first batch of 190 various automobiles and a large number of accessories. It was jointly purchased by Yanhua Industrial and Jianzhong Trading, two companies in this city. There are many types of vehicles, including Ford, Buick, Studebaker, Lincoln, Dodge, Morris, Standard, Packard, Fiat, Citroen, Chevrolet, and other brands. There are also ten LaSalle insurance cars, trucks, and jeeps. It is said that most of the cars are in good condition and can be driven once assembled. In order to facilitate the purchasers' licensing, the Highway Administration Bureau has sent a letter to the Municipal Public Works Bureau for record, allowing them to obtain new licenses.</p>

<h3 id="e130">United States Begins International Trade Week from Yesterday, Calling for the Promotion of World Trade and Prosperity Based on the Principles of Fair Trade <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>[United States Information Service, Washington, 18th] May 19th to 25th is US International Trade Week. US Secretary of State Byrnes and Secretary of Commerce Wallace both issued statements calling on the people of the country to promote world trade based on the principles of fair trade in order to ensure world peace and prosperity. International Trade Week is sponsored by the US Chamber of Commerce, and all US associations and international trade groups are participating in the campaign to stimulate the American people's awareness of international trade. Another important step taken by the United States to promote international trade cooperation is the proposal to convene a United Nations International Trade and Employment Conference, as well as to negotiate and conclude trade agreements with more than 14 countries and expand international air routes. The United States will also hold Maritime Day on the 22nd of this month. Maritime Day is to commemorate the sailing of the first American ship (Savannah) to cross the Atlantic Ocean on May 22, 1819. At the same time, the US Shipping Commission is studying and publishing a plan for US shipping business. According to this plan, the US merchant fleet will have at least 1,000 ocean-going vessels with a total tonnage of 10.5 million tons.</p>
<p>Secretary of Commerce Wallace declared: The United States can now supply the world's needs and revitalize all post-war undertakings. Therefore, the United States is eager to engage in this business, but this requires all nations of the world to freely exchange products and raw materials in order to achieve its full success. The essential point is that we should not aim at international trade for the purpose of dumping surplus materials and reducing unemployed workers, but should take it as our duty to supply the needs of other countries.</p>

<p>The 20 billion yuan spring cocoon loan for the three provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui began to be processed last week. Currently, more than a dozen silk manufacturers have been approved by the Loan Syndication Management Committee and are now decided to be released starting today. All approved silk manufacturers can designate the loan remittance location for payment. It is reported that the amount of loans requested by these factories ranges from a maximum of 1 billion yuan to a minimum of 100 million yuan. This year's sericulture in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces is slightly affected by the weather conditions, which are not warm enough. According to silkworm farmers who came to Shanghai from Wuxi and Suzhou, new cocoons have been appearing on the market in various sericulture areas. Silk cocoon merchants from all over the world have been setting up shops and opening for sale in the producing areas. Although the harvest of new cocoons is slightly less than ideal, the quality of the cocoons is still not bad. Currently, new cocoons from Weian in Zhejiang have been listed and opened for sale, with an initial sale price of 65,000 yuan per dan. New cocoons in the Hangxian and Yuhang areas will be opened for sale in succession this week. New cocoons in the Wuxi, Suzhou, Changzhou, and Jintan areas of Jiangsu Province are expected to be opened for sale in the coming days. It is estimated that the minimum harvest of spring cocoons in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces this year will be 200,000 dan.</p>

<p>[United Press, Rome, 18th] With global oil reserves dwindling, geologists are shifting their hopeful gaze to the United States. Mobil Oil of New Jersey was the first to contact the Italian government, and other companies have also expressed interest. A year after the 1859 Pennsylvania strike, oil was also discovered in Italy, making it the second country in the world to discover oil. People in the ancient Roman Empire knew how to use natural gas to light lamps. Even so, the production of American oil has always been low. From the year of oil production in 1860 to 1945, the total output was only 3,500,000 barrels (each barrel is equivalent to 42 US gallons). For previous "normal years", such as 1939, this number only covered 13% of the national consumption. Currently, about 100,000 barrels are produced annually, 90% of which comes from the Enirelia region in the north.</p>

<h3 id="e147">No Re-Imposition of Factory Tax: Statement from the Shanghai Commodity Tax Bureau <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>To the Editor,</p>
<p>Having read Mr. Zhu Shangyi's article, "The Issue of Commodity Tax and Business Tax in the Dyeing and Weaving Industry," published in your newspaper on May 6th, there are significant discrepancies with the facts. Herein is a brief explanation of the relevant parts of this Bureau:</p>
<p>The original article states: "...Therefore, it goes without saying that pure weaving factories should not pay factory tax for their cotton cloth production. For those that both spin and weave, the spun part should be subject to the unified tax, while the woven part should absolutely not bear the unified tax. This is also a self-evident explanation. As for the fact that the factory tax is levied on cotton cloth when it leaves the factory for the convenience of tax collection, it should be levied ad valorem based on the yarn content of each piece of cotton cloth, and should not include weaving labor costs and weaving profits..." and also mentions "...However, it is said that resident tax collectors of the non-pure weaving factories often levy the unified cotton yarn tax on the spun part of the factory, and then levy the cotton cloth factory tax on the woven part. Regardless of whether there is a legal basis for this, even if it is said to be a strict tax collection measure that cannot be avoided, after the cotton cloth leaves the factory and the tax is paid, one can apply for a refund of the unified cotton yarn tax. However, it is difficult to say whether the amount of the cotton cloth factory tax is levied ad valorem based on the actual yarn content of each piece of cotton cloth." To summarize the preceding and following points, it implies that after the cotton yarn factory tax is levied, the factory tax is also levied on the finished cotton yarn woven product. As for the method of taxing the finished woven product, it is questionable whether it is based on the yarn weight content or includes labor costs and profits. According to the Commodity Unified Tax Regulations, once the cotton yarn factory tax is levied, it is valid throughout the country and will not be taxed again. Therefore, this Bureau collects cotton yarn tax by sending personnel to reside in various yarn factories, and never collects it again from weaving factories. Cotton yarn that is directly woven into finished products can be transported based on the original cotton yarn tax payment certificate or distribution permit, according to the possible amount of finished products produced, in exchange for a pure weaving factory cotton yarn direct woven product transportation permit, without further taxation. It is not the case that cotton yarn tax is levied first and then cotton cloth tax is levied. Those who are taxed on woven finished products are only taxed purely based on the weight of the yarn content of the finished woven product. Labor costs, profits, etc., are naturally not included in the calculation. However, the so-called collection of unified tax on woven finished products here refers to the woven finished product inventory at the time of the city's recovery. Because that inventory, regardless of whether it was taxed during the enemy and puppet period, should be considered untaxed goods and uniformly supplemented. This is stipulated by the General Outline of Tax Collection Measures for Recovered Areas promulgated by the Ministry. If cotton yarn has already been taxed at the factory, before the pure weaving factory transportation permit is issued by the Ministry, and the woven finished product cannot be exchanged for a pure weaving factory transportation permit, if merchants are eager to transport and sell it, and voluntarily pay the unified tax on the woven finished product again to expedite the process, they can also apply for a refund based on the original cotton yarn tax payment certificate afterward. It is not a double tax. The original article says: "In order to facilitate export, weaving factories often pay the cotton cloth factory tax separately in order to comply." This is probably the misunderstanding that arises because of this. As for the issue of the distribution form, a detailed interpretation of the meaning seems to refer to the pure weaving factory transportation permit. Because the distribution form (the correct term is distribution permit) has never been abolished, and its function is to distribute goods or change the place of delivery based on the original tax payment certificate. For example, if the original tax payment certificate states 100 pieces of cotton yarn, sold in this city or transported to Guangzhou, and now 10 pieces need to be transported to Hankou, 10 pieces need to be transported to Chongqing, and the remaining 80 pieces are still sold in this city or Guangzhou, then the original tax payment certificate can be requested for distribution as above. This method has been in place for a long time and has not been abolished. It can be seen that the distribution form mentioned in the original article often refers to the transportation permit for pure weaving factories, in other words, it is commonly known as "exchanging yarn documents for cloth documents." This pure weaving factory transportation permit has long been reissued by this Bureau, but merchants may not be fully aware of it, so misunderstandings are inevitable.</p>
<p>In short, this Bureau handles tax affairs in accordance with established regulations. If there are any shortcomings, we sincerely welcome criticism and instructions from all walks of life. Therefore, we will explain Mr. Zhu Shangyi's misunderstandings to clarify the record and hope that you will</p>
<p>grant us the favor of publishing it.</p>
<p>Respectfully,</p>

<h3 id="e148">A Midsummer Night's Dream in Hangzhou <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>— Hangzhou Correspondence, 15th, Lin</p>
<p>By the time I arrived in Hangzhou, the season for spring outings had passed. I didn't get to see the "one peach tree next to another" on Su Causeway, and the sound of oars in the lotus bushes on West Lake hadn't yet arrived. Between spring and summer, I saw the true face of Hangzhou.</p>
<p>Legendary City</p>
<p>Hangzhou is inherently a city for tourism. This small city is nestled at the foot of the mountains and along the lake, having attracted countless tourists both ancient and modern. Historically, it served as the capital of the Southern Song Dynasty, leaving behind tales worthy of song and tears. To harmonize with its mountains and waters, the three legends of the White Snake Lady and Xu Xian, Tang Bohu and Qiu Xiang, plus the Living Buddha Jigong, are worth listening to endlessly. Geographically, Hangzhou boasts the West Lake and its surrounding hills, the snow-like Qiantang River tidal bores in the mornings and evenings. These waters, mountain peaks, streams, forests, and temples are enough to keep you lingering for thirty days, and you still won't be able to visit them all. Once you've set foot in Hangzhou, you'll find plenty to do for sightseeing and enjoying the scenery.</p>
<p>People who live in Hangzhou don't appreciate the value of sightseeing because they grow up surrounded by scenery. Eight years ago, when Japanese invaders attacked this scenic area, the people of Hangzhou, young and old, universally toured the mountains and waters on the outskirts of the city. But at that time, everyone was carrying bags, baskets, and helping the elderly and the young, leaving their homes. Although they had the mind to linger over the scenery of their hometown, the scenery did not keep people, so they had to abandon their homes and flee to other places. Even now, eight years later, there are still many Hangzhou natives who went to other places and have yet to return.</p>
<p>West Lake Tour Boats</p>
<p>We checked into a mid-priced lakeside hotel, which, along with the West Lake Hotel, the Die Lai Hotel, and the Cangzhou Hotel, all benefit from being located along the lake. Therefore, when washing away the dust of travel with West Lake water in my room upstairs, West Lake, with its shimmering waves, backed by the green mountains on the northeast shore, was calling out to me with swaying white canopy tour boats. For the past eight years, I had been poisoned by the Central News Agency's telegram at the time of their retreat: "A lake of lonely mountains, all the tour boats sunk to the bottom of the lake." I thought that West Lake had no tour boats and that they had all been sunk during the retreat eight years ago. This scene was just as stubbornly familiar as being surprised by the unchanged situation in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Many new West Lake tour boats have been built in the past eight years. Together with the original old boats, there are 350 in total. Their style has been unified, light and flat, with the same shape at the bow and stern. There are two boatmen, sitting at the bow and stern, rowing. In the middle section of the cabin, there are sofas facing each other, with backrests. Four people can sit facing each other, with a small round table in the middle for tea. When it rains or the sun is strong, a flat-topped awning with white cloth and red edges is erected for shade. When the wind blows, a curtain surrounds your lower body, without obstructing your view, but protecting you from the wind. These tour boats cost 2,000 yuan per hour, 8,000 yuan for half a day, and 13,000 yuan for a full day. It seems expensive, but if calculated in terms of the current food, accommodation, and the actual value of the legal tender in Hangzhou, it is not an "extortionate" price. The boatmen are all strong young men. Of the 350 tour boats, only fifty or sixty are moored on the lake each day (the area of Hubin Road is called "Qixia" by Hangzhou people, the place where the Manchurian Bannermen lived in the past). In reality, the boatmen have to wait for customers for six days to earn a day's labor of 13,000 yuan. The lake is raining with fallen flowers, and the situation is changing. Only one-sixth of the tour boats are rented out each day. The boatmen can only watch the passing tourists more lonely, and are too lazy to shout "Want a boat ride?"</p>
<p>Outwardly Strong, Inwardly Weak</p>
<p>A manager, who transitioned from officialdom to business and opened an international cinema in Hangzhou, analyzed the reasons for Hangzhou's outwardly strong but inwardly weak situation in his sofa living room. "The war is over, and the country has gained victory and face, but the people are empty. Hangzhou itself is like its mountains, waters, temples, waiting for tourists from other places to give alms and spend money, but it does not have the power to prosper itself. People from other places, after the turmoil of war, are all busy with their own livelihoods. Who has the leisure and money to come here to spend? Coupled with the inconvenience of transportation and the continuous warfare, apart from a few thousand wealthy families in Shanghai who can take time off to spend some money, there are no other customers who come here to inquire."</p>
<p>His words were very insightful. During my week in Hangzhou, I toured the lake with a quick, three-hour, horse-riding style tour for 6,000 yuan. The boatman hoped that I could go up to the scenic spots along the lake that we passed to see them, but I told him without hesitation to "row on!" Don't listen to "Willow Waves Listening to Orioles," don't look at the ruins of "Leifeng Pagoda at Sunset," and I didn't go to "Sheng Zhuang," where Chairman Chiang stayed when he came to Hangzhou. I only asked the boatman to row to the "Three Pools Mirroring the Moon" and the Huxin Pavilion in the center of the lake, which can only be reached by boat. I found that most of the new tourists were calculating like me, equally spoiling the scenery. Some even refused to stay on the lake for three hours, only making a one-way trip to the Three Pools Mirroring the Moon and then returning.</p>
<p>Waterfront Tea Houses</p>
<p>During the hurried tour, only the tea houses at Jiuqi Tea Plantation in the Nine Creeks and Eighteen Gullies, and in front of Lingyin Temple, and the tea house at Pinghu Qiuyue were the most attractive to tourists and made them reluctant to leave. These three places are all located near gurgling streams. The tender green tea made from the new Longjing green leaves on the tea seats makes tourists truly swallow the mountains and waters of Hangzhou. (Longjing tea is the tender leaves of tea trees on the mountains of Hangzhou, and the boiling water is made from West Lake water.) Thrifty tourists drink the tea cup by cup, turning the green juice into yellow water, until the tea becomes white water, before standing up and leaving reluctantly.</p>
<p>In order to see West Lake day and night, I was not stingy and stayed in a hotel at the city station or in the city, but instead greedily watched the different colors at different times from the lakeside building next to her. I love West Lake because such good mountains and waters exist naturally. In my chaotic life, she has only been close to me twice, each time for a short period of less than seven days. In Sichuan for seven years, I vowed to return to my hometown of Jiangnan and be with West Lake. I finally crossed thousands of mountains and waters to see West Lake, satisfying my desire to face West Lake.</p>
<p>Chatting About the Seawall</p>
<p>I have the fault of caring about people's livelihoods and like to hear about undertakings related to people's livelihoods. In Hangzhou, I took the time to visit Sun Xiaolou of the Zhejiang-Fujian Branch of the CNRRA, and his inspection director Zhang Zhongyu, and talked about the repair of the Zhejiang seawall as follows:</p>
<p>The Zhejiang seawall is divided into two parts: the North Seawall and the South Seawall. The North Seawall starts from Hangzhou City, passes through Haining, Haiyan, and reaches Zhapu Town in Pinghu, connecting to the seawall of Jinshan County in Jiangsu Province, a total of more than 200 kilometers. Due to the relationship between sea currents and wind direction, the Qiantang River tidal bore always beats against the north shore seawall. After eight years of disrepair, there are eleven gaps in the north shore, some only one or two zhang wide, and some one mile wide, with the most gaps in Haining County. The erosion holes in Haiyan County are also numerous, but have not yet reached the scale of gaps. The South Seawall only includes Xiaoshan and Shaoxing counties, which are shorter than the North Seawall. Usually, it is only subjected to the Jianghai tide bounced back from the north shore, so the threat is smaller than that of the north shore. Both seawalls were built in the Song Dynasty. The technology and construction methods of civil engineering at that time were naturally limited. It was never thought that thousands of years later, descendants would still rely on the power of their ancestors to provide water resistance protection. Therefore, although repairs have been carried out over the years, they collapse every year when the lake water rises, and are repaired every year. During the eight years of the Hangzhou War, the Japanese, like all the public works in the occupied areas, did not care about the consequences of disrepair. Therefore, the problems accumulated over eight years must be cured before the autumn tide of August 18th this year. After Sun Xiaolou took office in Hangzhou, he inspected the North Seawall twice, and also visited the South Seawall. Chen Zhongyu said that the young and strong American Mei engineer in his office is a true seawall expert. He was specially transferred by the CNRRA from the Panama Canal Zone to this place of excellent scenery for this matter.</p>
<p>Seawall Repair Plan</p>
<p>The Zhejiang-Fujian Branch already has a plan in mind for the seawall, and has found during the inspection: (1) For areas that have sunk – make immediate minor repairs; (2) Gaps – eleven on the south shore and thirteen on the north shore – make major repairs; (3) Areas that are firm but may be scoured or cause gaps – make immediate pre-repairs.</p>
<p>The seawall project began on February 25th this year in Haining County, where there are the most gaps, under the leadership of Chairman Zhu of the county council. The Zhejiang-Fujian Branch supplied 105 tons of flour as work food and 2 million yuan of cement as work materials. The entire major repair project began on May 5th and is scheduled to be completed before the autumn floods, with a cost of 60 billion yuan. The Zhejiang Provincial Administrative Yuan and the Zhejiang-Fujian Branch each contribute one-third, but the Branch supplies 20 billion yuan of work materials, such as flour and cement, which will not be affected by the depreciation of legal tender and rising prices. If the other two-thirds are legal tender, the phenomenon of insufficiency will inevitably occur again as time goes on.</p>
<p>The seawall is a dike built of stones and wood. The surface of the dike is six feet wide, with one foot wide of stones on the outermost side, two feet wide of stones on the surface inside, wood below, and three feet wide of mixed soil on the innermost side. Therefore, although the stones are strong, they are often thrown into the dike from the bottom of the water by the sea tide. Large stones, as large as tables, are actually pebbles in the giant palm of the sea tide. The total transformation into a mixed soil seawall project costs more than several hundred billion yuan, which cannot be held this year, but in order to protect the fertile rice-producing land on the two deltas of the Qiantang River and the Yangtze River from being flooded by saline seawater, this huge seawall construction project must be held. In the midst of turmoil, these are what deserve attention. But now people's eyes and thoughts are not on this, how can those who are accompanied by this kind of business day and night not be anxious? Director Sun Xiaolou is worried that once the rice-producing area is irrigated with salt water, the soil will not be able to grow rice for three to ten years, and the consequences will destroy the paradise of Suzhou and Hangzhou and create a new hell! Fortunately, major repairs to the gaps in the seawall can withstand this year's autumn lake, who can plan for next year's affairs? I want to ask the central government to take action as soon as possible.</p>
<h3 id="e149">The 5th Air Force Group, Seasoned in Battle, Guarding the Capital <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>— Nanjing Correspondence, 17th, Zhu Minwei</p>
<p>The Air Force stationed in the capital is the famous Zhijiang 5th Group, which is currently participating in the capital's large-scale exercise. A month ago, the 5th Group sent aircraft to perform low-altitude flying over Beijing and Shanghai, among which the ultra-low-altitude chase program was particularly startling to the audience. At that time, the aircraft were about five zhang above the ground. Because the speed of the P-51 fighter was very high, it flew very fast at low altitude, and the roofs shook wherever it passed.</p>
<h3 id="e150">Renowned at Home and Abroad for Distant Expeditions <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>Zheng Songyu, the Group Commander of the 5th Group, is a veteran general transferred from the 3rd Group. The Deputy Group Commander, Xiang Shiduan, is a veteran fighter of the 5th Group. He has been in the 5th Group for eight years, and has experienced hundreds of battles. His experience is quite extraordinary. In 1938, he graduated from the 8th class of the Aviation School and joined the 5th Group as a pilot, and began serving in the Northwest, as far as Hami. In 1940, he fought over Chengdu and Chongqing. In 1942, he rushed to aid Burma and was stationed at the Lashio Airport to protect the 200th Division armored forces of Du Yuming who entered Burma to assist the British army in resisting Japan. He once made a forced landing in Pyawbwe (en route from Lashio to Yangon) when the aircraft was damaged, escaped from the enemy area in a Burmese oxcart, and returned to our military territory. Later, he retreated into Yunnan with the army, and used [missing type] 15 Type 3 [missing type] fighter aircraft to defend against the invading enemy at low altitude along the Baoshan to Bhamo line in western Yunnan, killing many enemies. This was the revival of low-altitude attacks on enemy ground combat by our country's fighter jets. Later, the United States aided us, and Xiang Shiduan went to India with the team to receive training on P-40 fighter aircraft. He flew a P-40 aircraft three times from Karachi on the Indian Ocean coast back to China over the Hump. And fought with the enemy. Since the spring of 1944, he has been stationed at Zhijiang Airport in Hunan. He led his troops as the captain of the 17th Squadron of the 57th Group, attacking as far as Wuhan and as close as Changsha and Hengyang every day.</p>
<h3 id="e151">Wounded by Enemy Bullets, Healed, and Fought Again <a href="#e151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>In the autumn of 1941, during the Xiangxi War, during an aerial battle after shooting down an enemy plane, he was also surrounded by enemy planes and wounded in the back by bullets. Because he was healthy, he was healed and returned to the sky to fight. He destroyed countless enemy vehicles and supplies on the ground, blew up bridges, and annihilated enemy soldiers, lasting for a year. In May 1945, the enemy attacked Zhijiang in western Hunan again. Above the famous Xuefeng Mountain, Xiang Shiduan led the team with Commander Zhang Tangtian to attack the enemy's positions every day, killing more than 8,000 invading enemies, which led to the subsequent great victory in western Hunan, and the enemy army was defeated since then.</p>
<h3 id="e152">Led Several Members Deep into Enemy Lines <a href="#e152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>He considers his most satisfying achievement to be in June 1945, when he led the 17th Squadron across the Yuehan Railway line occupied by the enemy and stationed at Chaling Airport, which was surrounded on all sides. In this campaign, he brought eight flight capable members and six P51 fighters. The runway at Chaling Airport was 1,000 meters long, and the P51 could barely take off fully loaded. At that time, the enemy was already withdrawing from Guangzhou to Nanchang, and from Liuzhou and Guilin to Changsha and Yueyang every day. They took off and landed between the two enemy retreat lines, specializing in bombing and shooting the retreating enemy motorcades and wooden boat fleets, and achieved great results. A total of 100 enemy wooden boats and about 100 vehicles were sunk. In this campaign, the US military was solely responsible for supply, using three transport aircraft to transport oil, ammunition, and supplies. Although Chaling was a dilapidated village, it was quite spirited to have markings such as S.M.S.O painted on the walls of the dilapidated houses. The US military often said: "We are the Sino-US cooperative air guerrilla team." Everyone's daily life, because it was in the countryside battlefield, was almost in the primitive era, and the custom of grabbing and eating roasted chicken legs was prevalent. There was a green small river near the airport. After returning from battle, everyone first took off their clothes and swam in the river to cool off and restore their tense bodies.</p>
<h3 id="e153">Swimming Across the Vast Sea Without Fatigue <a href="#e153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>Xiang Shiduan is from Guangdong. Not only is he meticulous and steady in flying, but he also loves swimming. Years ago, when I traveled with him to Mount Emei for the summer, he was traveling from Chengdu to Mount Emei. On the way, he encountered a large river. While the car was being ferried across, he, along with the then Fifth Squadron Commander, Zeng Dachi, swam across the river, covering a distance of two to three thousand meters without tiring. In society, he is usually courteous, but his nature loves the unrestrained life of primitive society. The Fifth Air Force Squadron, under his assistance and the command of Squadron Leader Zheng, protects the capital! It can be said that the work is progressing daily. (The photo is a recent portrait of Deputy Squadron Leader Xiang.) He rarely goes out, except to handle squadron affairs in the barracks at the Daxiaochang training ground. He only goes on hikes to scenic spots on holidays.</p>
<h3 id="e154">Deputy Squadron Leader Xiang Shirui – A Shocking Suicide Case Amidst the Reorganization of the Jiangxi Provincial Government <a href="#e154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>— Nanchang, 12th Dispatch, Jiang Zhaoran</p>
<p>The reorganization of the Jiangxi Provincial Government is a major restructuring of the era. For those involved (committee members, heads, committee members and secretary-general): Among the six people, only two are suitable for their respective positions. One of them is Cheng Maoxing, a committee member and director of the Land and Food Department. Cheng is from Xinjian County in Jiangxi Province, and is 51 years old this year. He has served as a commissioner in Sichuan Province and as a deputy minister in the grain department. He returned to Jiangxi last August, succeeding Hu Zhaozhao as a member of the provincial government and director of the Land and Food Department. Cheng's continued appointment to these positions was generally seen as an indication of the central government's great reliance on Cheng, which Cheng should have considered an honor. Unexpectedly, two days after the news of the provincial government's reorganization was published in the newspaper (April 10th), Cheng suddenly committed suicide in Ji'an. It turned out that Cheng was ordered on April 6th to set off from the province to various counties along the Gan River to urge the purchase of surplus grain and supervise the transport of stored grain. He found that there was a severe shortage of grain boats along the way, and residents in disaster areas stated that there was no surplus grain available for purchase due to the period between harvests. At the same time, Cheng checked the actual amount of grain stored in each county and found that it was very little, vastly different from the figures reported to the province. As a result, Cheng was worried and angry, and extremely distressed. After arriving in Ji'an, at around 2:00 PM on the 10th, he used "taking a walk" as an excuse, taking only one attendant with him. He went to the edge of Bailu Pool, and taking advantage of the attendant's inattention, jumped into the water. The water was deep and turbulent. By the time the attendant noticed and jumped into the water to try to save him, he had already become a "god of the waves." Cheng left a pair of suicide notes before his death, which were found afterwards. The gist of the notes was that various parties were demanding grain, but the counties had no grain, and there were very few grain boats. There was no way to think of a solution, so he could only commit suicide to repay the country and apologize to the people.</p>
<p>After the news of Cheng's suicide spread throughout Nanchang, there was much speculation from various parties, but this reporter should not engage in any speculation. I will just say one thing: This is a shocking suicide case!</p>
<p>From right to left: Lai Yi, Bei…Na…</p>
<h3 id="e155">The Doorkeeper of the World – United Nations Secretary-General Lai Yi <a href="#e155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>— Specially Translated by this Newspaper's Translation Department</p>
<p>In the early days of the United Nations Organization, many people expressed reliance on it. When the Security Council was about to convene, several unfortunate twists and turns occurred, and the beliefs of these people were inevitably shaken. The issue of Israel was an emergency, the first difficult hurdle that the United Nations Organization had to find a way to overcome. But people with unwavering faith believed that the United Nations Organization would be able to overcome obstacles and reach the path of peace. One of them is Lai Yi, the Secretary-General of the Organization, a strong-willed and pragmatic Norwegian lawyer.</p>
<h3 id="e156">Absolutely International, Unaffected by Anything <a href="#e156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>As Secretary-General of the United Nations Organization, Lai Yi can be called the world's first internationalist. According to the United Nations Charter, he can bring to the attention of the Security Council anything he believes threatens international peace and security. According to the Charter, his responsibility is "absolutely international," and he is not affected by any country in the United Nations in his duties. He can truly be regarded as the doorkeeper of the world.</p>
<p>His primary task is to manage the United Nations Organization. He is the chief administrative officer of the Organization, and in this capacity, he presides over various meetings of the General Assembly, the Security Council, the Economic and Social Council, and the Trusteeship Council, and must perform other tasks entrusted to him by these bodies. Lai Yi readily accepts tasks beyond his own, which is a demonstration of his amazing abilities.</p>
<h3 id="e157">He Needs Talent and Employs Competent Personnel <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>According to the rules established by the General Assembly, Lai Yi may appoint all staff of the Secretariat and assign appropriate personnel to the Economic and Social Council and the Trusteeship Council. This not only requires extraordinary talent, but also requires painstaking research and consideration. As he himself said: "We often employ whoever we meet first, but I think it is best to decide slowly, so that the people we employ are competent. It is better to be cautious beforehand than to rush into things and then realize after two or three months that we have employed the wrong person. Because at that time, moving one or two people will completely subvert the entire department."</p>
<p>The selection of staff should be based on two principles: first, to seek the highest standards of efficiency, talent and integrity; second, to ensure that the staff employed are widely distributed among the member states. Lai Yi acknowledges that adhering to these two standards in selecting staff is certainly costly, but he firmly insists that it is a necessary condition.</p>
<p>With the consent of the Security Council, Lai Yi may notify the United Nations General Assembly of any matter discussed by the Security Council relating to the maintenance of world peace and security; when the Security Council ceases to discuss such matters, he must also notify the General Assembly in the same way, or, if the General Assembly is in recess, notify the member states of the United Nations.</p>
<p>Therefore, from the point of view of selecting and directing combatants, Lai Yi's power is very great, practically equivalent to a dictator. But in terms of Lai's authority over the delegations of various countries, his task is that of a coordinator, not a director.</p>
<p>When the United Nations General Assembly and Security Council first met in London, Lai Yi's public activities were not particularly noteworthy. He did not serve as chairman; he quietly attended meetings and quietly withdrew. Indeed, if it were not for the somewhat tense expression on his face, people would have regarded this shadowy figure sitting in the meeting place as a detective. Lai Yi, like Attlee, is most popular in the committees. His sincere attitude, firm will, and fair handling of issues give people a good impression. He is not the typical figure who is easily exploited politically, and he does not have the moving gestures of an orator. However, he possesses the virtue that the world and the United Nations Organization need.</p>
<p>At the age of fifty, Lai Yi is a commoner who speaks out for the common people of the world and dedicates himself to their cause. His intelligence and talent are far above the average person, but in the past seven years, he has encountered the physical and mental dangers that the average European has encountered. His experience has not only given him a sense of closeness to the people of Western Europe, but also to the people of the world.</p>
<h3 id="e158">Complex Personality, Knows How to Handle Situations <a href="#e158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>There are many contradictory aspects of Lai's personality that are worth studying. A famous Frenchman criticized Lai as "a proletarian with brightly shined shoes," which is a superficial observation, but it does point out two contradictory points in Lai's character: he is a proletarian, but in the complex international arena, he knows how to work and how to cope.</p>
<p>There are few gray areas in Lai's character. He is black and white. Strong will is probably his most prominent characteristic. He has the shrewd thinking and strong will of an ordinary farmer, and he works with Norway's top lawyers. But this strong will is tempered by genuine friendship. He can treat his friends and subordinates with great affection and loyalty, but he can also fly into a rage, startling his companions, but sometimes this brightens up a dull situation.</p>
<h3 id="e159">New Job, Inclined to Always Speak Frankly and Openly <a href="#e159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>
<p>In recent years, he has learned to curb his anger and his tendency to talk casually about his work. Now, he exudes a gentle and amiable attitude. His face is long and round, and he often breaks into a smile. He often gestures with his hands and tries to maintain a graceful posture.</p>
<p>His gradually fattening and large frame is usually dressed in blue clothing. He also understands the customary small talk at cocktail parties in the diplomatic arena, although, like most officials in the British Labor government, he does not like this social custom. Many people intend to decorate the new headquarters of the United Nations Organization, but Lai Yi opposes it. He is in favor of simplicity, frankness, and openness.</p>
<p>Before he set off for the United States, he said to people: "I hope that we can show by facts that we are serving the interests of the people everywhere in the world and will never use the diplomatic tricks of the past."</p>
<p>Throughout his life, Lai Yi has witnessed thousands of problems being resolved through negotiations and discussions. He advocates using internal or external discussion methods to resolve international problems. Lai Yi's own debating skills have been honed in government committees, courts, and Norwegian political party debates. He has discussed world affairs with Norwegian sailors and British soldiers, and listened to the calls of people helping to build a new world.</p>
<h3 id="e160">Mother Opened an Apartment, Listening to Union Debates <a href="#e160" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c160" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">160</a></h3>
<p>Lai Yi began to get involved in society in the industrial area outside Oslo. His mother opened a small apartment there. At that time, he was still a schoolboy. In his spare time after school, he often heard Swedish syndicalists and Norwegian trade union members arguing in the apartment.</p>
<p>Lai Yi couldn't bear to see his mother toiling so hard, so he resolved to become famous and successful. In 1914, he entered the University of Oslo, but after leaving school, he did not enter the business world, but joined the Norwegian Labor Party and became close to Jorgensen, the daughter of the local military station chief.</p>
<p>In addition to immersing himself in books and politics, Lai Yi also became a famous football and track and field athlete at the University of Oslo. However, by the time he obtained his law degree, he had already become the private secretary of Tranmæl, the secretary of the Norwegian Labor Party. In 1921, he and Jorgensen married and went to Moscow as the secretary of the Labor Party delegation. It was during this visit that Lai Yi heard Lenin's speech.</p>
<p>The following year, he became the legal advisor to the Norwegian Confederation of Trade Unions, a position he held for thirteen years. In addition to handling court cases, he also wrote many explanatory pamphlets. He held moderate views on labor policy. As his political activities expanded, his circle of friends also expanded. Soon, the young labor lawyer's friends in Vance Conden were almost as numerous as his friends in the Soviet Union. He began to travel throughout Western and Northern Europe. At the same time, the Oslo lawyer began his journey as a citizen of the world.</p>
<p>But in 1935, when he joined the Norwegian government as Minister of Justice, he was merely a capable young man from Oslo. Indeed, his sociable personality, his impatient temper, and his occasional political missteps annoyed some of the key members of the party. One of these key members once said: "I think Lai Yi is a genius six days a week, but on the seventh day, he is just a child."</p>
<h3 id="e161">Political Character Assessed from Political Views <a href="#e161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>As for Lai Yi's political character, it is best to assess it from his personal reaction to the two main political ideologies (communism and fascism) prevalent in the first half of the twentieth century. As a socialist, he was very concerned about the progress of Soviet socialism, and at the same time, as a European, he was very excited about the Soviet Union's position as a strong country in Europe and the world. However, because he is a social democrat from Northern Europe, he favors evolution rather than revolution, and because he is a Norwegian and a Western European, he firmly and enthusiastically believes in the various freedoms in the Bill of Rights.</p>
<p>People with such political leanings, namely democratic socialists who believe in socialism, are of course rejected by the highest degree of fascist national socialism. Lai Yi witnessed the German Social Democratic Party being dissolved by the Nazi leader, and their leaders being forced into exile or detention in concentration camps. As a cabinet minister of a country with a population of three million, he was of course helpless in this regard, but we have reason to believe that Lai Yi's current dedication to world peace and human freedom is most stimulated by being on the border of Nazi Germany and witnessing the dark situation in Germany.</p>
<p>One day in September 1939 after the outbreak of war, when Germany invaded Norway, he was managing the most important asset that Norway could contribute to the United Nations: the Norwegian merchant fleet of 3.5 million tons with a crew of 25,000.</p>
<p>In November 1940, Lai Yi became the Norwegian Foreign Minister, which was the stepping stone to his current position, because this position enabled him to have contact not only with the representatives of the great powers in London, but also with the envoys of small countries that had been annexed by Germany.</p>
<h3 id="e162">Lai Yi's Supporters are the Two Strongest Countries <a href="#e162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>Lai Yi's current position has aroused general speculation: "Who is supporting him?" This speculation is fruitless, because those supporting Lai Yi happen to be the two most powerful countries. The country that first recommended Lai Yi for an important position in the United Nations Organization was not the Soviet Union, but the United States, contrary to popular belief. In November 1945, the US State Department suggested to the Soviet Union that it nominate Lai Yi as Chairman of the United Nations General Assembly. Later, this position was taken by Spaak, and the Soviet Union then nominated Lai Yi for his current position as Secretary-General.</p>
<p>Now, this Norwegian "leader of the common people" spends his days and nights with the great men of the world, while maintaining close ties with the people. He has the ability to seek welfare for the men and women of the class he came from. His friends scattered in various countries all consider him to be a resolute and courageous fighter for peace and human rights.</p>

<p>Editor: We are from the cadre training class of the police academy, and it can be said that we are all very pure young people. We have been trained in the capital for a year, and the hardships we have suffered are truly indescribable. It was not until the victory of the War of Resistance that we were ordered to return to the capital. Due to inconvenient transportation, we traveled thousands of miles on foot for three months, enduring dew and rain along the way, and suffering immensely. When we arrived at the capital police academy, we took academic exams and waited to be assigned. Now that the country is being built, the first priority is to rebuild the police force. The central government, recognizing the need to improve the quality of the police, has promulgated a new police system, using the police district as the basic unit for implementing duties, starting in Beijing and Shanghai and gradually expanding. Therefore, the superiors are using our batch of students to test the new system. Please allow me to use your newspaper to describe our mission and dispel suspicions or misunderstandings from all sectors.</p>
<p>The objects of our service are all citizens, and our mission is to protect the people. The relationship between the people and the police is very close. If there is no police force, society cannot be stable and the people cannot be at peace. If the police are separated from the people, then all duties cannot be discussed. The gain or loss of popular support depends on whether the police can be close to the people. Among the people, the police must play a leading role at all times in order to gain popular support. Now that the War of Resistance has been won, it is even more important to seize popular support and strengthen national construction.</p>
<p>We believe that the police are for all the people, not for a few, and should not be abolished because they are inconvenient for a very small number of people. Then, the police must go deep into the people, think of the people in everything, and plan for the people in every way. Especially since we are new police under the new system of modern China, our style should be completely different, and we should also fulfill the responsibilities of managing, educating, nurturing, and protecting the people. For example:</p>
<p>(Manage) The scope of police management is very wide, so-called, no matter what happens, no matter when it happens, no matter where it happens. In this way, the police should be there for people everywhere. For example, if a tricycle is only allowed to carry two people, the police must manage if it exceeds the regulation and advise him to avoid danger. Also, if people's homes are not closed at 12:00 at night, the police must ask him to close them to avoid theft by thieves. In this way, they should be constantly responsible, exercising the powers of management, so that every person can live and work in peace.</p>
<p>(Teach) The police are the people's teachers, the judges of the streets. Therefore, they must always lead by example and improve society. President Chiang said: "The police teach people, regardless of the pond, regardless of the person, and regardless of the road. They teach order, discipline, and guide people to the paths they should follow, obey, encourage, and avoid." This is to show the police the principles of doing things.</p>
<p>(Nurture) The police are the people's nannies, so in addition to managing and educating the people, they must also truly love and nurture the people. The ancient saying: "Let the old have a place to end their lives, the strong have a place to use their strength, the young have a place to grow, and the widowed, orphaned, and disabled all have a place to be nurtured." This is truly the highest standard for the police to nurture the people. Of course, due to various restrictions, we cannot achieve this level, but we should set this as our goal and truly take on the responsibility of nurturing the people.</p>
<p>(Protect) The greatest responsibility of the police is to protect the lives and property of the people and maintain social order. Therefore, the word "protect" is the most important task of the police. Since the police have the important responsibility of protecting the people, they must have the spirit of sacrifice and struggle, and the determination to eliminate violence and protect the good. To eliminate violence for the people, they will not hesitate to become benevolent and take righteousness. To protect the good for the people, they are determined to brave dangers and overcome difficulties. Only in this way can society be peaceful, and the people can live in peace. This is the police's responsibility to protect the people.</p>
<p>In short, the police must be responsible for the people when performing their duties. The police have the opportunity to exercise their powers in any place, but the most likely shortcomings are abuse of power and abandonment of power. The result of this abuse and abandonment is the main reason for the people's contempt. If the people despise the police's authority, then how can they exercise their powers and how can they advance their work? Therefore, to make the people believe in the authority of the police is the first problem to be solved. The police must always put the interests of the people first and start with being truly responsible when performing their duties. Manage for the people, disperse for the people, nurture for the people, and protect for the people. Do not abandon the powers that should be exercised, and do not abuse the powers that should not be exercised. Only by doing this can they be worthy of being police officers under the new police system. Yuan Shengkui</p>

<p>Editor: My hometown, Zhujiajiao, is in Qingpu County, a very famous town. During the period of its occupation, it did not suffer from the enemy's devastation on the surface, so it was regarded as a paradise. After the victory, a district chief came. He also served as the district chief of Kunshan County and the principal of a primary school. One person held four or five positions. He created a rice tax, collecting two dou of rice per stone regardless of whether it was bought or sold; he also collected business subsidies, collecting from all households according to the number of people, and if there was a slight delay, he would immediately arrest them and detain them; he established a clean-up office with a false name, taking all the fertilizer from the town without compensation and selling it; he also sheltered opium and gambling (he himself smokes opium), charging fees for each lamp. The bodyguards he hired took their box cannons every day and waited in the four markets for rice boats to pass by, extorting rice taxes. A villager went to town to sell rice, and because he had no money to pay the tax, a conflict arose. The gun was fired and the villager was almost killed, causing the rice shop to strike. The people here are full of complaints. May I disclose this letter so that everyone knows that there is such a dark and gloomy thing happening here? Ge Dejin, May 13th.</p>
<h3 id="e166">Science Forum: Will the Atomic Bomb Explosion Dry Up the Ocean? Will It Shatter the Atmosphere? <a href="#e166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>— Translated by Our Newspaper Translation Department</p>
<p>Scientists say: When atomic bombs are tested on the surface of Bikini Atoll this summer, there will be no drying up of the ocean, shattering of the atmosphere, causing earthquakes, or triggering huge tidal waves around the world. However, when the second test bomb, which is designed to explode on or beneath the ocean surface, detonates, various spectacular phenomena are likely to occur immediately within the surrounding waters.</p>
<p>Several Phenomena May Occur</p>
<p>Rear Admiral Thorvald Solberg, who is in charge of the target ship operation during the Bikini atomic bomb tests, said: Explosions on or beneath the water surface will "vaporize seawater into steam-like clouds." At a press conference, Solberg and others described several phenomena that might occur during the atomic bomb tests at Bikini Atoll:</p>
<p>Seawater Turns into Hydrogen and Oxygen</p>
<p>The millions of degrees of heat generated after the bomb explodes may split the surrounding seawater into its original components: hydrogen and oxygen. When the heat rapidly decreases to 20,000 degrees, the separated hydrogen and oxygen atoms will recombine to form water molecules again. This is the chemical nature of hydrogen and oxygen.</p>
<p>Spectacular Surging Seawater</p>
<p>Therefore, under all possible circumstances, the atomic bomb explosion will create a secondary and potentially colorful explosion, as water molecules regain their original state. Solberg said: This surging of seawater is quite spectacular, but not particularly frightening. He also said: On average, the atomic explosion will boil the seawater over an area of one square mile. "The primary damage to various ships will result less from the high heat than from the shock and blast."</p>
<p>Fleeting Atomic Flash</p>
<p>Rear Admiral Parsons, Deputy Commander of the Test Force, pointed out: When the first test bomb is dropped, some separation of hydrogen and oxygen may occur in the atmospheric layer. The explosion of the atomic bomb several hundred feet above the water surface will create a point of air descent. Parsons also mentioned: When the first atomic bomb was tested in the New Mexico desert on July 16 last year, the intrinsic atomic flash lasted only for "one-thousandth of a second," followed by two fainter "halos," which changed the atomic cloud from purple to pink. These flashes may have been caused by hydrogen and oxygen recombining into water droplets in the air. Parsons concluded that the atomic bomb explosion is unlikely to create a series of core or chemically unimaginable reactions, so it is unlikely to become an unexpectedly destructive monster.

<p>— Our Newspaper Suzhou, 12th Dispatch, Correspondent Wu Shouren</p>
<p>The giant wheels of time are moving forward non-stop, but Suzhou has unfortunately been abandoned in the tracks crushed by the wheels, becoming increasingly isolated from the new era. It has already shown the old age of "the sunset is infinitely beautiful, but alas, it is near dusk."</p>
<p>Eight years of enemy trampling have certainly caused Suzhou to suffer serious internal injuries, and the social conditions after the recovery, such as the insecurity of public order and the corruption of basic-level autonomous administration, are all encounters darker before dawn, calling Suzhou to wear a garment of victory, but ultimately unable to hide the internal scars. Over 1.3 million people struggle on the line of starvation, unable to live in peace and unable to enjoy their work. Looking at this ancient city, one truly feels a sense of unbearable recollection.</p>
<p>Police administration has been tight since the recovery, and remains so now. The pay is meager, and the armed forces are weak. There seems to be no hope of reform in the short term, and local public order has achieved nothing. Robberies and thefts are frequently heard of. Every middle-class resident of Suzhou tightly bolts their doors at night, and unless you speak with a familiar accent, don't even think about visiting your friends in the evening. The police bureau in charge of personnel has been transferred four times in a short eight months. Recently, a provincial order was issued, transferring Zhao Weijun, the police chief of Jiangyin County, to take over, but he has not yet arrived at his post.</p>
<p>In its early days, the County Provisional Assembly showed some new spirit of public opinion. General public opinion expressed great admiration. However, a month has passed, and apart from passing the county budget, there is nothing worth mentioning, and it is very quiet. Public opinion, at this stage of restoring order and lingering in transition, is difficult to get the expected evaluation, which is very regrettable.</p>

<h3 id="e168">Welcoming Minister Wang Yunwu <a href="#e168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>— Yi</p>
<p>Recently, the Executive Yuan passed a resolution appointing Mr. Wang Yunwu as the Minister of Economic Affairs. From the standpoint of production and construction, we deeply rejoice at getting the right person.</p>
<p>First, Mr. Yunwu is one of the few domestic experts in scientific management. The most effective function of scientific management is to turn a dying business from defeat to victory, and to make a smooth business flourish. Before implementation, it emphasizes comprehensive planning, and during the implementation process, it focuses on effectiveness and efficiency. In the past, after the January 28th Shanghai Incident, Mr. Yunwu used scientific management methods to complete the revival of the Commercial Press. The environment at that time was very harsh. But as a result, it was ultimately able to increase production and increase profits. At present, China's production industry is fragmented and suffering greatly, so Mr. Yunwu's appointment as the Minister of Economic Affairs can give him an opportunity to display his talents and assume the heavy responsibility of revival.</p>
<p>Second, Mr. Yunwu comes from the private sector and is very familiar with the situation of all private enterprises. In the future, he will certainly be able to seek reasonable solutions to alleviate the suffering of private enterprises without any barriers.</p>
<p>Third, Mr. Yunwu visited the United Kingdom during the war and observed the situation in the UK at that time in great detail. Their perfect system can be implemented in China under the condition of adapting to the national conditions.</p>
<p>Recently, when Mr. Yunwu was interviewed by a reporter from the Central News Agency, he mentioned that "it is people who make things happen" will be his future policy guideline. This point is in line with the principles of scientific management. He himself attaches great importance to efficiency. Some colleagues at the Commercial Press criticized Mr. Yunwu's statement that one only needs five minutes to eat, believing that it was impossible. This is because most people do not pay enough attention to work efficiency. Many people spend too much time on personal matters and too little time on public matters.</p>
<p>We hope that after Mr. Yunwu takes office as the Minister of Economic Affairs, he will be able to gather specialized talents from all aspects, have concrete plans for future policies, and implement them step by step. After a considerable period of time, we will certainly see results.</p>
<p>People who study scientific management feel a special interest in a difficult situation, because opening up a difficult situation and turning it into a smooth and prosperous one can show the talent of a manager. Mr. Yunwu must have the same feeling on this point, so he has affirmed that this appointment as the Minister of Economic Affairs is for doing things, not for being an official. Therefore, we have unlimited hopes for Mr. Yunwu, and we hope that his subordinates will be able to cooperate fully and take on the task of revival.</p>
<h3 id="e169">New Trends in British Industry and Commerce <a href="#e169" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c169" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">169</a></h3>
<p>— By Claire Neikhd, Translated by Zhou Qinghe</p>
<p>Since the end of the war, countries have been making every effort to develop overseas markets, especially the United Kingdom and the United States. The points mentioned here can serve as a reference for China's industry and commerce. Translator</p>
<p>Whether you buy goods in Brooklyn or Samoa, you can know that the British have begun to promote sales.</p>
<p>They will go to the United States and every other country in the world, they will sell large quantities of bicycles, hair brushes, wireless toasters and Scotch whiskey everywhere, because they only have two paths to take, that is, sell goods or die of economic malnutrition.</p>
<p>Because the Americans have the markets that the British desperately need to acquire, the British are likely to encounter economic death. They understand this very well, so it is not enough to simply manufacture fine goods and sell them at fair prices. They must also become the most astute salesmen in the world. For this purpose, they created an organization called Betor.</p>
<p>Betor is an abbreviation that stands for British Export Trade Research Organization. This organization is practical and does not advocate superficiality. One of the principals once said: "We don't want to talk too much, but this organization, in the eyes of the average Briton, is really very American."</p>
<p>Even in the United States, there are few such large-scale plans. That organization is already prepared to serve as a collection of talents and a propaganda machine for British industry and commerce. Its greatest task will be to find world markets and calculate the needs of people around the world, the needs they will generate, or the needs they can be made to feel, and then sell the goods to them.</p>
<p>In order to accomplish this task, it is necessary to establish a close communication network all over the world and hire experts to preside over it. Those experts will prepare forms based on the actual situation of each place, including local clothing, climate, colors, education, customs, habits, religion, etc. Based on these factual investigations, they can inform the country what to manufacture, where to send it, and what price to set.</p>
<p>They have a strong advertising organization, abbreviated as abprice in English, which is heavily subsidized by the British government. It is based on the best American advertising methods to create advertisements to tell the Turks, Argentinians, and even people around the world that British aspirin is the best medicine for headaches. No advertising medium will be overlooked—newspapers, magazines, radio, movies. A principal in a British Chamber of Commerce said: "We will use all the methods that Americans have used, even high-pressure sales methods."</p>
<p>The entire plan has received great assistance from the British government, although the main income comes from membership fees paid by seventy British manufacturers, and there is capital of 200 million yuan.</p>
<p>This organization was started in the spring of last year. On the one hand, the British business community watched the American businessmen competing for the market, and on the other hand, they watched the domestic situation, and they were indeed a little disappointed. The UK itself has to pay a huge sum, totaling 200 million yuan. Part of it is the previous investment in various places abroad, which has obtained very rich benefits, but since the war broke out, this source of benefits has been temporarily stopped. Part of it is to pay for the cost of the war. Her people are starving, and the machines in the factories are already old and must be replaced. Many pre-war markets have been lost.</p>
<p>Therefore, export is the lifeline of the UK. Only by absorbing money through exports can it cope with the things that need to be imported for living, and the current number has increased. Therefore, even restoring the pre-war market cannot cope. In 1939, the UK exported goods worth 240 million yuan, and now it should only increase its exports by 50%. British merchants have already begun to move towards this goal. According to the chairman of Lloyds Bank, British merchants are indeed working hard, but they are encountering considerable setbacks everywhere, because when the British arrive, they find that the Americans are already there.</p>
<p>A British industrialist once said: "This situation makes us feel like a woman is preparing tea for her husband and going out, her husband has already gone out with a rescued girl, and she has already taken out the coffee sugar bowl."</p>
<p>This competition is quite rapid, but the UK must not be slow, but should catch up quickly. It must improve the machines needed for production, strengthen the sales organization, and then, through the above-mentioned organization, use advertising methods to encourage people from all over the world to buy British goods instead of buying goods from other countries, or not buying goods at all.</p>
<p>Among American businessmen, there is great interest in this kind of work. Commerce Secretary Wallace said that exports are not only necessary work, but also closely related to the American full employment plan, so it is formulated to reach a number of 100 million yuan per year, which is three times the export volume in 1939.</p>
<p>In Europe, which has suffered war losses, a part of the number can be occupied, but in order to expand the market, Americans are more concerned about permanent markets. The UK's gaze is the same, she is paying attention to the following places...</p>
<p>Soviet Union: This is one of the largest markets in the world, with 200 million people, and needs a lot of machinery, electrical appliances and consumer goods.</p>
<p>China: This is another big market, with 450 million people. If long-term loan facilities can be provided, it will need a lot of machinery, railway equipment and consumer goods.</p>
<p>India: With 389 million people, they can buy all kinds of manufactured goods if they have sufficient purchasing power.</p>
<p>Near East: In addition to Egypt and Turkey, there are Iraq, Iran, Palestine, etc., which are all very rich markets and should not be ignored.</p>
<p>Latin America: This is the most valuable market. They have cultivated a very strong purchasing power during the war. They need transportation tools, agricultural tools, and electrical appliances. Americans have already penetrated Mexico, Cuba, Colombia, etc. The UK has Argentina and Uruguay in the gold pound group. Brazil, Peru, and Chile are also big buyers, as long as the price is cheap.</p>
<p>The UK has a superior advantage in participating in this market competition. Her machines and trained technology are superior to the UK's, and raw materials are very abundant. The number of ships is also three times that of the UK, and she has strong financial resources to implement long-term loans.</p>
<p>But the Americans are not willing to just stay in their own advantages. They have already organized a research committee to study the sales problem in the United States, and another group is conducting a survey in the Middle East, and the United States' huge advertising budget—250 million yuan—will be deployed in South America, Turkey, Egypt and China.</p>
<p>If advertising alone can determine the outcome, the United States can win. But the British also have their confidence, and this confidence advertisement is based on several realistic situations. First, the British, under the leadership of Prime Minister Attlee, have the same confidence as in the Churchill era. Second, the United States still needs British goods. In the past, one-third of the United States' exports were shipped to the UK, and one-quarter of the imports were shipped from the UK. At present, the United States still hopes to maintain this good relationship, because the commercial competition between the United States and the UK is certainly very fierce, but it also hopes that the UK will not be in a dead end, and hopes that they can help each other.</p>
<h3 id="e170">Definite Goals <a href="#e170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>
<p>— Fei Wen</p>
<p>A person who does management work must have definite goals. Before he deliberates and implements various matters, he must act according to these goals.</p>
<p>In the past, the manager of the office of a wholesaler in the United States discovered that there were too many types of printed materials used in his recording department. Too many types of printed materials not only increased printing costs, but also required more manpower to use those too many printed materials, so the costs also increased. To solve this difficulty, it is necessary to use a basic principle, that is, to consider whether each type of printed material is absolutely necessary? If it is not absolutely necessary, then it can be eliminated or the two can be combined into one. In this way, the recording department of the wholesale merchant saved 3,000 yuan in expenses each year, and the other indirect expenses saved by other departments due to the simplification of procedures are not included.</p>
<p>A retail store had more and more inventory, but sales were not good. After a careful check, it turned out that the goods they were purchasing could not be sold quickly, so their funds were stuck and their turnover was not flexible. The solution after research was whether each type of goods could be sold immediately when it was purchased. After adopting this policy, the result was that not only was the variety of goods more organized, but also the flow of funds was smoother. This method is also a method of adopting basic principles to seek solutions.</p>
<h3 id="e171">General Introduction to Mutual Commerce Management <a href="#e171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>— Xu Baiyi</p>
<p>Price and Cost Issues</p>
<p>The issue of goods prices and costs is very important to a business, so it is worthwhile for us to study it deeply. If a manager can know the reasons for price fluctuations and take the necessary coping measures, and at the same time accurately estimate his manufacturing costs, then he can manage his business well.</p>
<p>What is price? Price is the tool to measure value. For example, if we say that the price of a tent is five yuan and the price of a set of clothes is fifty yuan, then we can know that the price of a set of clothes is ten times that of a tent, and we can know the connection between the two.</p>
<p>Governments of various countries have regulations for the unit of currency. For example, in the United States, one yuan is equal to gold 23.22, but sometimes the price of goods will increase, which is the relationship of the depreciation of the currency system. For example, a certain commodity has always been five yuan per piece, but at present, it cannot be bought without fifty yuan. This is superficially the increase in the price of the commodity, but in fact it is the depreciation of the currency system.</p>
<p>When the value of the currency system is declining day by day, it is worthwhile for a manager to borrow money from various places and repay it on a regular basis. Because the currency system when he borrows money is even lower in value when he repays it. But whether the currency system continues to decline should be foreseeable in advance, so whether to continue borrowing money and continue purchasing goods is very important for an operator.</p>
<p>If a manager does not take into account possible changes in the market and moves forward blindly without looking back, when the market price falls, people will generally hold a wait-and-see attitude and stop buying, hoping to get a lower price. At this time, the sales of goods are stagnant and the flow of funds is stuck, which will form a state of slump, so the research on price aspects is very important.</p>
<p>In addition to the issue of the currency system, the situation in terms of needs can also affect prices. For example, a factory is willing to pay a higher price because it is afraid that it will not be able to purchase the required quantity, then the price will increase. If several places sell a kind of goods at the same time, and one of them is willing to sell at a lower price, then it will be enough to suppress the price of the goods.</p>
<p>What is market price? The explanation of the two words market price is the price at which a kind of goods is sold in the market. This market depends on the situation of various goods. The sales scope of many goods is limited to one place, and the sales scope of many goods can be expanded to the whole country or even the whole world. The prices in the markets in various places will vary because the supply and demand are different in various places. For example, the flour mill in the UK needs to buy the largest quantity of wheat, and the representative in Liverpool pays a higher price, so all places with wheat will be shocked by it, which may affect the wheat market all over the world, so the determination of the market price is based on the situation of needs and supply in various places.</p>
<p>The buyer who is willing to pay more mentioned above is easy to increase the number of suppliers, but the impact may also lead to overproduction.</p>
<p>Often when the price of a certain commodity increases due to the wider need in all aspects, after it can generate more profits, many people will engage in the production of this commodity and hope to obtain considerable profits. Even people who originally worked in a factory will set up their own factories to engage in manufacturing. This situation will result in overproduction. At that time, in order to enable the goods to continue to sell, they have to reduce the price for dumping, so only larger-scale factories can continue to maintain, and smaller-scale organizations with insufficient strength will be eliminated.</p>
<p>The cost of sales is included in the cost of the goods: The general understanding is that the cost of a kind of goods only includes its manufacturing cost. In fact, from an economic standpoint, the cost of sales should also be included in the cost of the goods. Moreover, as has been said above, a kind of goods with excellent quality is easily accepted by the public, so the cost of sales required can also be saved. All goods with lower sales costs can indirectly affect their costs. That is, their cost is also relatively low, so in a business, although the sales of goods are responsible by the sales department, they should also try their best to reduce costs. Otherwise, if the actual manufacturing cost of the mouth product is indeed low, but the cost of sales is very high, or it takes a lot of advertising expenses to make the goods sell, then the result will not be able to obtain substantial profits.</p>
