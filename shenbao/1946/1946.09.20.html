<h3>平綏綿國軍推進迅速　豐鎮涼城相繼收復　張垣共軍進行破壞工作</h3>
<p>〔中央社歸綏十九日急電〕國軍十九日下午收復平綏綫豐鎭及舊凉城（凉城縣舊址），綏東僅興和一縣未收復。（按豐鎭位於大同以北約七十華里）</p>
<p>〔本報北平十九日電〕綏東另路南下國軍十八日晨一時收復凉城，至此綏東僅餘興和一縣尙未收復。</p>
<p>〔本報歸綏十九日電〕綏東國軍先頭騎兵，刻到達隆盛莊附近。綏南於昨日光復凉城後，國軍已在大海泊盆地切斷雁北共軍之應援，並能穿過平原，接近豐鎭。由綏遠還鄉之雁北難民，頃在右玉南山一帶活躍，使綏南共軍之後方，感受重大威脅。自河曲保安部隊進駐縣城及洋關老營後，晋西北割据區共方民兵反正者，亦如綏東風起雲湧。平魯縣境近有大同近郊失散之國軍，由安當國率領，打擊延安至張家口之父通。</p>
<p>〔中央社歸綏十九日電〕集寗東南二公里之攻瑰營古營盤等地，爲共軍聶榮臻之第十一旅及敎導旅等部所盤據，十五日全部爲國軍擊潰，並將以上據點確實收復。</p>
<p>〔本報天津十九日電〕據悉，集寗會戰中，共軍已損失其綏東察南晋北全部兵力之半數，顯爲一殲滅性之打擊。</p>
<p>〔本報歸綏十九日電〕察綏邊境之僞蒙軍烏勒吉敖蘇爾部六百人，曾在國軍收復集寗時，向我武川後方襲擾，業被守軍及四子王旗保安部擊退，集寗收復後，該部僞軍即向蘇尼特旗逸去</p>
<p>〔本報北平十九日電〕今證實張家口已呈現共軍撤出承德前之狀態，飛機塲已於前日破壞，每星期四之軍調部聯絡飛機，今未能飛出，發電廠亦已破壞，所有重要物資機器，均搬運一空，市內外遍築工事，軍調部張家口小組政府代表之電台，昨起被共方勒令拆除，並監視政府及美方組員行動，政府方面對此已向共方抗議，美方對於該小組之安全，尤爲關心。故已曾向政府方面提議，使該小組撤回，謂飛機已不能在張家口降落，則由共方送該小組人員於冀察邊境之國軍防地，共方尙無表示。</p>
<p>〔本報北平十九日電〕記者今訪軍事關係當局，詢以共軍作戰實力與張家口問題。據稱，證諸國軍收復冀東十二縣之速，及綏東連下卓資山集寗迫豐鎭，以及共軍以八萬大軍圍攻守軍不足萬人之大同，而尙未攻下，則共軍實力如何已可看出。共軍在集寗之相互包圍會戰中，所蒙損失之大乃四平街戰役後之最重者，其影響共軍今後作戰意義，殆與四平街戰役相同，故豐鎭亦如長春，國軍到時隨之而下，觀共軍在張家口之種種表現，其是否將放棄張家口，固不便斷言，但假使政府欲收復張家口，則縱以與攻大同相等兵力與國軍作戰，將亦無濟於事，甚至能吾維持一週，亦屬疑問。另悉，除大同方面共軍外，張家口及其外圍共軍的爲五萬，冀東戰事結束時，有李運昌部約萬餘人經平古綫密雲南方西去，在該地被國軍一團截擊，損失千餘人。</p>

<h3>明年度財政方針　開源將重於節流　總預算須遲至十一月始能決定</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十九日電〕據悉：明年度財政方針，因客觀情勢，節流將重於開源。明年歲入部份，財政當局希望能藉遺產稅、綜合所得稅等之提高徵收，以裕國庫，但因種種技術條件之限制，展望並不良好。此外，如出售敵僞產業及國營事業之收入亦不能作過於樂觀之期待，因此中央機關勢將裁員减政。以地方財政而論，經改制後，縣級財政可有改善，省財政則依然困難，故緊縮亦爲必要。有關人士表不，依目下各機關編製預算之速度推斷，明年度總預算恐須遲至十一月始能決定。</p>

<h3>天降甘霖唐桂放　洪都熱望主席來</h3>
<p>— 本報特派員　房滄滄</p>
<p>南昌見聞之二</p>
<p>南昌市郊，爲贛江東岸最大之盆地，全年雨量不過一千二百公厘，夏季甚熱，今年入秋多南風而小雨，灼熱令人不可耐，最近三日曾連降陣雨兩次，炎威已殺。甘霖既降，唐桂欲放矣。（青雲譜有五株桂，爲唐時所植。）</p>
<p>洪都父老，南昌市民正每日翹首匡盧，熱望元首之來臨，昨今牯嶺曾傳來多種不同之消息，亦未能減低任何一人歡迎之熱忱，主席之南晶臨時行轅，將於態寓或省府選擇其一，隨從人員則下榻洪都招待所，交通部湘鄂贛區電信管理局洪局長指揮下之各級電信工作人員，又繼牯嶺偉大成就之後，造成第二奇蹟，主席行轅必須之話報設施，固已完成優越之準備，京滬漢各地來此之新聞記者，亦備蒙優遇，獲得迅速傳遞消息之便利，南昌電信工作人員待遇甚低，因爲經費短絀，不時要吃寅糧，借債維持生活，但是他們的服務道德，都不落人後。</p>
<p>江西文風之盛，不減於蘇浙皖戰前的敎育很發達，現在因爲復員無力，交上了死運，所喜南昌的新聞事業，已呈現顯著進步，對開報現有民國日報，中國新報，新聞日報，力行日報，捷報，大衆日報，華光日報等七家，四開報有文山報，以及新商報，鋒報（晚報）報紙的內容和形式，均不弱於外埠的報紙，報人的待遇，都少得令人難以置信，聽說最高的月薪不過二十萬元，可是他們的工作精神和風格，都稱得起是上流，最可愛的，是他們還保有徐儒子時代那種恭儉禮讓的優良土風。</p>
<p>不到江西，不知江西政治方面內在之困難，一般批評態式輝在江西的成就，是主計與統計，前者辦得很確實，後者做得很普通，後來，「能」夫「曹」隨，這兩件事也做得差強人意，因此現在江西的民政，財政，建設，敎育，保安，社會，衛生各方面，爲了適應當前的需要，都須有一番興革，據一位江西前輩談：在理，形勢便宜了江西（指長江，鄱陽湖，贛江）也害了江相，（指粵贛邊之庾宿，九連山，閩贛邊之武夷山，湘贛邊之武功山，萬洋山等由獄地帶。）目前幹政治的要踏實的向前去做，依據當前急需，民政，敎育，保安，衛生四事，必須大刀闊斧的去做，至於財政，建設社會各事，不妨按步就班去做，以期日進有功，不託空雷，切忌虛橋浮躁，少用妄人。</p>
<p>江西基層政治的貪污之內，到現在還沒有廓清，省級的政風尚稱端謹，不過昨日之滬漢記者在商會的公宴席上，曾經聽到一位先生的約略陳述了南昌稅務人員估定營業，利得兩稅不合宜的作風，又談到江西的糧政也是一件痛心的事。一位以身殉糧的好糧官已經長眠於青雲譜傍之烈士墓中，但是本省的糧，到現在還沒有交清，人們看到糧都嚴令運清，人們看到糧部嚴令運清餘糧的消息後，似乎都有說不出難過，大家咬牙咒詛共產黨。</p>
<p>記者昨日參觀市區之萬壽宮，還是南昌市內廟宇中碩果僅存的雄偉建築，廟內香火很盛，據聞從陰歷八月初一起到年底，每天最少要消耗二三百萬元。</p>
<p>南昌至吉安公路，昨日修竣，今日通車，由本省至湘·粵·閩·皖·均通行無阻。</p>

<h3>聯總遠東區會結束　過以運華食米改運饑饉區　外輪協助運輸行總救濟物資</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕聯總遠東區大會，十九日上午十一時一刻，在中國銀行大廈續開，仍由蔣廷黻任主席。討論要案有二：（一）美代表吉爾配屈律克提議，今年全世界皆感糧食缺乏，而中國若干地區，幸能豐收，故建議將聯總運華食糧，改爲運至確係飢饉之地區，且以運輸工具確能到達者爲限。蔣廷黻氏以吉氏此議，顯於中國不利，且亦與聯總大會之議決案不符，當即聲明中國不能接受，並據理加以駁斥。蔣氏聲稱：如此議竟予通過，則黃河災區之工程勢將中止，且確定某一地區是否確待救濟，事實上困難必多。中國本年收成較佳，係氣候所賜，惟若干因戰災而根本未能種植之地，則天氣縱佳，仍無收成可言。美代表否認此舉將影響黃河工程，且謂，彼之提議可使救濟工作於事前有適當計劃。蘇聯代表塞米那斯表示附議，謂彼甫知考察災區後歸來，認爲飢饉原因，初不全在糧食之缺乏，而實由於分配之不當，故認美代表之建議實屬「中肯而必要」。此案旋付表決，謂聯總遠東區大會係審議機關，所有議決案並無法律上之約整力量。（二）美代表爲增強行總輸運救濟物資之速度，建議由外輪協助，蔣廷黻氏即指陳，此事牽涉頗廣，問題頗爲複雜，並謂，英代表當知之甚詳，惟經表決後，仍獲通過。</p>
<p>最後，蘇聯代表對陣納德將軍組織空運隊事，促請大會加以考慮，但彼並未作正式建議，故大會中亦未有若何決定，旋於下午一時散會，此第廿五次聯總遠東區大會，至是遂告結束，下次大會定十一月十三日召開。</p>

<p>社論</p>
<h3>獨立自主的外交政策</h3>
<p>我國外長王世杰氏，自出席巴黎和會返國後，前天在京首次招待中外記者，重言聲明我國對外政策，一本平等互惠的原則，與各友邦締結商約。當此英美法三國均欲與我國商訂商約之際，王外長發表此項聲明，實具有重大意義。他說：「中國政府之既定政策，爲盡力運用外國資本及技術，以發展中國資源，及提高中國民衆之生活水準，此即我國最近對於商業公司問題及有關事項立法之指導原則。」他又說：「中國政府對於將與吾人締強商約之國家，均擬予以最惠國待遇，享受此項待遇之條件，厥爲互惠。中國在其領土上任何部份，不擬對任何外國採取任何差別待遇。」</p>
<p>王外長的這一席話，說明了我國對外政策的指導方針，簡潔明朗，不僅足使各國對於我國外交政策所發生的疑慮，均能煥然冰釋，抑且可以引起世界各國對於我國的同情。但是其含義深長，尚有加以說明的必要。</p>
<p>第一，外交政策應基於本國的需要。我國經過八年艱苦的抗戰，雖已獲得勝利，但早已弄到精疲力盡。放眼看看國內情形，瘡痍滿目，元氣未復；加以我國的生產技術，不論農業工礦，均甚落後，與各友邦相較，無不相形見絀。在這種環境下，欲言復興建國，談何容易！所幸中國地大物博，人口衆多，只要有資本和技術，就不難開發這蘊藏豐富的資源。</p>
<p>國父孫中山先生的建國方略，早已指示國人利用外資開發資源的途徑。現在我們正要從事建的工作，首在發展工商業，以提高國人的生活水準，則運用外資與技術以開發資源，確是目前所最迫切需要的。但是要特別注意，就是「主權在我」，一切悉視中國的需要而定，不可誤入歧途，使中國成爲外國資本競爭的塲所，而逐漸又淪於經濟的次殖民地的地位。</p>
<p>第二，外交政策應有獨立自主的機能。我國爲了本身的需要，同時也爲了世界的和平，促進人類的進步，一本著平等互惠的原則，與所有各友邦締結商約，對於任何國家，決無歧視。這是完全出於我國的自主，不受任何的約束。以目前實際的情形而論，我國產業尚未工業化，還不能與各友邦站在平等的地位，根本談不到互惠。所謂互惠，老實說，就是中國吃虧。惟各友邦須知，要中國吃虧，也該有個限度。所謂外交，本來就是保衛國家生存的一種政治技術，如果不能發揮獨立自主的機能，則所謂平等互惠，就會喪失其意義。</p>
<p>第三，外國人對於中國的看法，其基本觀念，迄今似乎還沒有澈底革新。外人論中國政治，不是說「不干涉中國內政」或「中國慶超出於兩大勢力圈之外」，就是說「門戶開放」或「機會均等」。其實這些過時的老調，在中國老百姓眼中看來，好像依然是沒有把中國看成獨立自主的國家。外人即無此意，至少他沒有認清中國在世界政治上今後所應處的地位。王外長說，「倘若此種態度，可認爲門戶開放政策，則此所謂門戶開放者，實爲中國本身之政策。」換言之，門戶既然是我國的門哀悼，則開放不開放的主權，完全在我國的手裏。我們開放門戶，無損我國主權，但是外國一定要向我要求，那就顯得中國的門戶要由他來作主了。</p>
<p>第四，我國外交政策既以平等互惠爲原則，自不讓任何一國在我國內享受特權。這是我國上下一致共同的願望。蔣主席前在開羅時，亦曾親自向美車故總統羅斯福表示此項意見，當得羅氏的同意。但目前的實際情形，究底是怎樣呢？香港與九龍租借地還在英國統治之下，我們姑且不談，而旅順大連二地，我們是否已照中蘇條約共同使用？所以我們不得不指出，在中國享受特權的國家，其特權一天不放棄，則平等互惠的原則，如何運用，勢將大成問題。</p>
<p>要之，外交是內政的延長，有其不可分性；尤其在強權政治盛行的時代，要外交有力量，更須修明內政。我國外交政策，在理論上雖極健全，但必先謀得國內的統一與強大，始有成功的希望。</p>
<h3>九龍城設治問題</h3>
<p>在上海市參議會通過提案請政府迅予進行收回香港九龍以後，這幾天來，關於九龍城調治問題，又甚囂塵上。事態之起因，在粵實安縣政府擬在其轄境九龍城派員設治，我外交部依據一八九八年北京條約，認爲事屬可行。正在籌備進行之中，香港政府發言人突聲稱：「中國官吏在九龍城內之治權，已因與英方軍事需要有所抵觸，宣告中止。」我國外交當局因是又發表談話，對港政府發言人之指陳，加以否認，認爲依據一八九八年中英條約，既准「現在九龍城內駐紮之中國官員仍可在城內各司其事，惟不得與保衛香港之武備有所妨礙」，我國自可在九龍城派員設治，固未曾放度在九龍城之治權，特各官司事，「不得與保衛香港之武備有所妨礙。」關於九龍城設治一案，現在由外交部兩廣特派員向港方交涉中，將來如何發展，國人正密切注視。</p>
<p>九龍城是清代捍衛海疆築城設戍的遺址，其他所占面積不大，即在太平洋戰前，亦已荒廢不堪，徒資憑弔懷古而已。英人經營港九，而一任九龍城荒廢，可知在九龍城內，原應由我國官員駐紮，各司其事。從法律的觀點論，我國在九龍城保有主權，是絕對沒有問題的事。不過現在全國人民正在期望整個香港九龍問題的解決，願及早見港九的重回故國懷抱，此際而有關於九龍城設治問題的提出，彷彿有點節外生枝，跡近有點捨本逐末。我們決不懷疑這是轉移國人視線的一種企圖，從整個港九的收回移轉到九龍城的設治，但此一問題的被提出，無疑地，將使收回港九的主題爲之混淆。我們現在所要爭回的不是一個荒廢的九龍城，而是整個香港九龍！此種枝節問題的提出，是否能有裨益於整個港九的收回，也實在值得我們的考慮。</p>
<p>國與國交，像私人關係一樣，我們不可忽略了情感的關係。現在國際形勢如此，而我國內政局又還不曾趨於安定，我們在這個時候更需要朋友。中英兩國在第二次世界大戰中所受的苦難最深，我國在亞洲獨力抵抗了日本軍閥的侵略，英國在歐洲也獨力抵抗了納粹的侵略。中英兩國是患難之交，在戰後世界秩序的重建上，更需要中英兩國緊密的攜手。「不以清理帝國而來」的邱吉爾，以他對於英國的豐功偉業，還不能得到英國人民的支持，可見他們對於本國的前途，原有確切的認識。艾德禮的出組政府，對於英國的傳統政策，原主有所修改，以適應當今新的環境。英軍的撤離埃及，印度的准予獨立，都在表示英國對外政策的動問。在這種形勢之下，香港九龍的收回，似乎不難實現。外交關係，貴乎運用得宜。我們此際要尋求與國，不可忽略與我們有傳統關係的英國，所以我們現在實在應該珍視中英間的友誼。九龍城設治問題的提出，或爲中英關係上一宗不愉快的事。倘我們從遠大處著想，則覺得對於這種枝節問題的提出，實有察秋毫而不見輿薪之感。觀乎英大使之晉謁王外長，而不談及九龍城設治問題，可知道一問題還不曾引起外交上的注意。</p>
<p>要之，對於主權所在，雖寸土尺地，我們自當必爭，那是毫無問題的事。不過現在全國人民在股切期待整個香港九龍的收回，九龍城設治問題的提出，轉使主題趨於複雜而策瑣。如果整個港九收回了，決不會有像這種九龍城的問題。我們要問，政府倒底怎麼打算交涉收回港九？但同時我們要聲明，收回港九的要求，是爲中國，亦爲英國，而決不能看作中國人民有絲毫排外的意思。</p>
<h3>鄉人在流淚！</h3>
<p>稻穀熟，乳鴨肥，魚鮮蟹銹，藕大如船，青菱紅菱相映成趣，好一幅江南魚米之鄉的秋景。然而這幅美麗的圖書裏，有大批大批靈魂聖潔的鄉人在流淚！原子彈送來了國家的勝利，原子彈卻帶不走鄉人的悲運，敵奸的敲剝，戰後的創傷，其痛苦還沉重地壓在鄉人身上。鄉鎭的社會越來越窮，鄉人的生活也愈降愈低，安居啓業的憧憬，成了幻滅的悲哀。命運多蹇的鄉人，似悲傷，似感慨，而實憂懼！</p>
<p>今日的鄉人，實在住在「土匪」世界，寢食不安。東搶西刦，幾乎天天有，處處有，夜裏有，白晝也有。盜匪或多或少，多的擁有百來人，儼若軍隊，有機關槍，有小鋼砲，居然公開致函區公所，要求給養費，否則武裝入鎭。區公所記報縣政府，縣長一紙公文，叫他們自衛。自衛要人，自衛要錢，自衛更要槍；就算人力財力可出自地方，但槍從何來？私人既禁藏槍，公家復不發槍售槍，自衛云何哉？欺人而已矣！鄉鎭無警務可言，保甲組織又祗起敗壞的副作用，良民惟有坐以待搶，或遷往大城。都市人口激增，除逃共黨之難外，土匪多如牛毛，也是一個主因。生產者變爲消耗者，更釀成生之者寡，食之者衆，焉得不民益窮而財益盡？</p>
<p>鄉人種田已民至末路。米價壓得平賤，而工資物價蒸蒸日上，不幸而有演成「穀賤傷農」的趨勢。試以近上海的崑山東鄉爲例，拿一畝田計算，最好收成可獲一石半米，每石米現值四萬元，一畝可得六萬元，與成本相錯無幾。每畝需肥料豆餅一張，一萬二千元，包工五工，每工最低價四千元，共二萬元，還去租米六斗，二萬四千元，試問所剩幾何？鄉人胼手胝足，終歲辛勤，所爲何事！出米時，米價偏偏特別賤，鄉人須還債，非糯米不可；待得米糯光了，米又高漲了，春三四月，青黃不接，農家已無米可炊，又只得買貴米。種米的人，自己吃不著便宜米，天下不平之事，還有過於此嗎？至於徵購軍糧，又是鄉人倒霉。上邊發下來的購糧錢初與市價彷彿，但下邊辦事人拿到這筆款，移作生利之用，等到命令催得緊，要繳糧了，此時米價早貴，於是硬壓鄉人，以低價收米。鄉人何辜，負此重擔！</p>
<p>鄉鎭敎育已民瀕破產。以破產的敎育，敎育怎會不破產？縣裏沒有敎育經費，要鄉鎭自籌一半，開學初三個月規定由地方維持，以後三個月讓縣政府想法。鄉鎭籌款防匪之不暇，那有心腸顧及敎育？於是不能不收學雜費。雖然二萬上下的收費，在學校不過是杯水車薪，在家長卻已無力應付。結果，造成了大批學齡兒童失學。鄉鎭敎師待遇，連頭帶尾，月不過六七萬元，這戔戔之數，拿來買米好呢還是買菜好？有的敎師迫得請助敎，自己走單幫，假使循軌蹈矩走正路，只有死路一條！</p>
<p>因爲窮，因爲愚，鄉人疾病特別多，特別流行。侵略國家的敵人已去，侵略身體的敵人復留待我們給它抗戰。復員回鄉，看看鄉友，略無半在，不是溘從朝露，便是倐掩夜台。「過隙不留，藏舟難固」，山川在目，室邇人遐。死者都屬年青力壯的人，多以癆病，痢疾，傷寒，霍亂而喪亡。活在的年輕人，尤半在患瘧疾，肺癆，消化不良，性病，沙眼和瘡疥等症。鄉人不懂預防常識，又無科學診療，不知糟蹋了多少生命。正常的孕婦，健康的嬰兒，不該死而死的，數亦驚人。中國人不值錢，中國鄉人更不值錢；人死了，等於死一頭貓死一只狗，輕描淡寫的過去了。這種現象，蔓延在全國的每個鄉鎭。</p>
<p>城市裏的不肖漢奸，多數在法律正義前屈膝府首了，而鄉鎭裏的無骨頭漢奸，因鄉人敢怒而不敢言，尚逍遙法外，無恥得來的錢，正在化名買田買地，開店開廠，仍是不可一世。再隔一時期，恐怕將滿口道德，又做粉鼻樑紳士，欺壓良民了。而入水不濡入火不焦的光明志士，乃反而衣食不周，每況愈下。如此不白不黑的鄉鎭社會，徒使忠　屏伏，狡佞得志！漢奸迎賊作父，狐蒙虎皮，出賣國家，魚肉同胞，抵銷了抗戰的力量，延長與加深了鄉人的痛苦，論其罪，實有甚於敵人。當聞鄉人講，「敵人不怕，漢奸眞怕。」樸實的鄉間出此敗類，也算是丟人的事。我們抗戰的重要憑藉，就是民族的正氣，這類民族渣滓不予懲處，人世間將無所謂公道。親民之官，首應肅清鄉鎭的奸逆。</p>
<p>吾國以農立國，孔曰「富庶」，孟曰「恒產」，皆不出農事。文化起源於耕稼，而今鄉鎭社會不安定，鄉人千災百難，農事怎樣發展？文化怎樣叫它生根？爲今計，第一要遏止內亂，求得一個和平統一的國家，嚴密保甲制，安提成散軍遊擊隊，發槍械，強化組織地方自衛隊，與鄰鎭守望相助，澈底解決土匪。米價物價工價應同時調整，消弭畸形的市面。徵購軍糧限期宣短，宜在穀熟時期。中央應以鉅款補助地方敎育。衛生機關要普遍下鄉，衛生敎育要普遍實施。根據蔣主席三十三年嚴格辦理漢奸的聲明，務使忠奸不兩立，邪正要分明，使好人有勇氣。這是需要拿槍彈打穿每一個惡毒漢奸的胸膛來證明！</p>

<h3>華萊士仍留任現職外交政策論爭休戰　昨與杜魯門總統成立協議　保證和會結束前暫行緘口</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社華盛頓十八日電〕商務部長華萊士本日前往白宮，訪謁杜魯門總統，作長時間談話。事後據華氏告記者稱，渠將留居現職，但保證暫不發表公開演說。華氏之正式聲明稱：「總統與商務部長曾從長作友誼討論，事後部長得到結論，即渠當暫時將不再發表公開聲明或演說，以待巴黎和會結束時爲止。」本月十二日華氏在紐約馬迭遜廣場發表攻擊貝爾納斯國務卿外交政策演說後所引起之困難局勢因而澄清。據華氏左右談稱：杜魯門總統亦贊同華氏對美國外交政策主張之若干點後，華萊士乃保證暫時緘口。但政治觀察家指出華氏所由出此，因欲保留其日後發言權之故，一俟和會結束華氏又將發表公開言論，重新造成國內緊張局勢，結果足以影響本年十一月間之大選。</p>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓十九日電〕杜魯門總統與商長華萊士昨夜會談後，已成立美外交政策戰之休戰，故美內閣危機之是否得以避免，當視國務卿貝爾納斯之態度而定，蓋貝氏固有權保守或破援此一「休戰」也。迄至目前爲止，貝氏對於杜魯門與華萊士所成立之妥協有何反響，尚未宣知。杜總統與華萊士談兩小時半，華萊士已表示願意住口，故料貝爾納斯對於此一與其外交政策意見極端衝突之人物，或當編續聽其在內閣供職。紐約時報評稱，華萊士已無自由發言權，華氏其實無妨不任閣員而向國民發表其意見。今所成問題者，乃內閣中同時見有主張相反外交政策之兩人，不知其外交政策是否支持得住耳。</p>
<p>靜候白宮消息　貝爾納斯再決定態度</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕華盛頓十九日廣播巴黎訊：美國務卿貝爾納斯深居簡出，僅與英代表亞歷山大相過從。貝氏迄未發表任何批評，至少須俟今晚杜魯門華萊士會談之結果宣佈以後，方始表示其態度。英國代表團認爲此事不致削弱貝氏之地位，且純係美國內部問題。法國代表雖亦堅持此係美國內政問題，但顯露不安之態。某外交家公然指出此事嚴重影響美國代表團在和會中之地位。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社華盛頓十八日電〕白宮新聞秘書羅斯頃宣佈：商務部長華萊士前於八月廿三日上杜魯門總統一函，其副本業由總統送達國務卿貝爾納斯，原函則已列入白宮檔案。此函內容如何落入美國記者手中，殆無人能知之。</p>

<p>〔法國新聞社巴黎十八日電〕對義經濟委會本日開會，於討論第六十六條款之後，即將其第一節（即義大利放棄對聯合國之一切要求），第二節（即義政府必須償付盟軍統帥部在義國所發行之通貨），以及第三節（即義大利對於盟國處理義國船艦所採之措置，不得有所要求），逐一予以通過。此外特里埃斯特小組會，亦於本日午後開會，討論該區立法議會所當事有之權限，空氣甚爲緊張，未能獲致協議。各國代表或主張成立權威政府，與反對派互相雄辯，亦無進展。</p>

<h3>日德勾結經過暴露　國際法庭昨提出證據　軸心國的來計劃先取新加坡　偷襲珍珠港乃日軍閥最後變計</h3>
<p>〔聯合社東京十九日電〕遠東國際法庭檢察官今日開始暴露軸心國陰謀。日前首相東條英模機深信日本力量足以擊敗美國，曾向德國保證，祗須使用一部份兵力，即可使美國屈服。副檢察長文納聲稱：東條曾告德前外長李賓特洛甫，如在陸上與美國交戰，儘可無憂。當時德國曾向日本提出各項要求：（一）佔領新加坡，摧毀英國在太平洋上之要塞，使其對德作戰遭受重大打擊。（二）使美國在太平洋方面疲於奔命，不克參加歐戰。（三）日本在南下征服英·法·及荷蘭屬地之前，應先對蘇聯作戰。泰文納並稱：日本於一九四一年七月以前，雖已準備作戰，但未決定向美國開戰，足見在一九四一年七月至十二月間，另有未經發表之原因，使日本突然偷襲珍珠港自希特勒取得德軍最高指揮權後，德國之亞洲政策即爲之一變，既撤銷一切對華援助與指導，更希望日本能與中國以最後打擊。據希特勒決定，美國若參加歐戰，日本應進攻新加坡菲律濱。不意在一九四一年七月至十二月間，日本主戰派竟有偷襲珍珠港之重大決定，以致影響全局日前駐德大使大島與駐義大使白島敏夫，均曾欺騙東京，並指導師德國誘令日本參加歐戰。德日兩國關係，在此數年中之發展如下：〔一九三六年〕日本關東軍恐蘇聯自北面進攻，不敢南下。〔一九三七年〕</p>
<p>德不滿日本在中國造成事變，七七蘆溝橋戰事發生後，曾警告日本，應對全世界負責。〔一九三八年〕希特勒獲得最高指揮權，自中國撤退所有軍事顧問，停止接濟軍用物資，並承認僞滿洲國。是年十月，德日兩國共同承認其敵人爲蘇聯。〔一九三九年〕大島與白島兩人拒絕傳達東京電報與德國政府，在對蘇採取任何軍事行動前，應先協商。德蘇協定使日本發生恐慌。〔一九四〇年〕英美兩國對日本在中國設立之傀儡政府，態度益顯強硬。</p>
<p>日本之南進將包圍越南與暹羅，使德國不安，惟日本確告德國，將使美國艦隊困守太平洋，不克參加歐戰。來栖大使告德國，日本若佔領新加坡，可助德國早日結束對英戰爭。〔一九四一年〕大島通告德國，新加坡必須由海陸兩路大規模作戰，加以佔領。希特勒親自允許將德國科學發明給與日本，且之作戰。日本通告德國，美國若參加歐戰，日本不擬立即對美作戰。是年七月至十二月間，日本因未經發表之事故，改變其進攻新加坡計劃，於十二月七日實行偷襲珍珠港。</p>
<p>副檢察長泰文納就各種證件提出概要，證明日本決定襲擊珍珠港，乃其週密的征服計劃中比較最後三分種的決定。日軍閥於一九四一年夏末之時，認識新局勢之後，乃決定襲擊珠港。此時以前，日本多數領袖猶欲搗毀英國之新加坡基地，而創造富裕之東亞帝國，對於美國，僅顯示最低限度之力量而已。關於日本倘放棄珍珠港，而集中於馬來及荷屬東印，甚至側擊菲律賓，則美國是否將參加戰爭，即使參戰，又將至若何程度？此一問題，迄仍爲此間軍界爭論中心。此次庭上所提證件，或足以證明日本侵美各領袖生遲至一九四一年七月，甚至七月以後，猶信美國可在不經直接打擊下，阻止於太平洋，而日本則盜取一帝國。彼等自一九三九年起，即更番與德國討論軍事征服計劃，歷四年之久。一九四〇年九月日前陸相東條在樞密院會議中宣稱：「以我國之軍隊而論，可一理對美發生戰爭，祗須運用全部力量之一部份，已足濟事。」厥後日德談判軸心公約時，完全著重於佔據新加坡，認爲此乃致命的一擊，足以摧毀盟軍在亞洲之力量。德國欲日本掃蕩英國在遠東之勢力，而直接或間接使美國忙於干涉歐洲。日本準備對英美雙方挑戰，但各種證件中僅偶然提及襲擊菲律賓之可能性，一九四一年七月御前會議中，猶未準備作珍珠港之襲擊。</p>
<p>又悉：今日開審時，副檢察長泰文納開始本案起訴新階段，誦讀日前駐德大使之大島之言，承認曾與李賓特洛甫秘密計約，泰氏稱：「余將證明軍事條約之談判，係經日本軍事途徑進行，余更將證明日本陸軍勢力強大，足以強迫政府依照陸軍意志行事。」被告律師羅根迅速攫住機會，即問：「此言新奇，泰文納君豈代表本人？抑代表全體檢察團發言乎」？因檢察官如承認日本軍人控制政府，堅強至此，則受審之日閣員及其他政府領袖，或可藉此開脫戰罪僅係執行軍方之強硬命令而已。庭長魏勃稱：此點庭上憂願知之。泰氏稍有惶惑之狀，魏勃遂提早五分鐘退庭，「予彼以片刻時間，加以思索」，顯係便利泰氏與委楠磋商也。又泰氏當提及東條自信能擊敗美國，並誇口祗須日陸軍之一部份，即可擊潰美國之時，東條在被告席中雙目凝視天花板，緩緩搔其下額頦。</p>

<p>關於支出方面，歲出共八百四十七億元，經審査會審査結果，擬减少人事支出，將人事經費五百二十五億普遍打八五折，可减少七十八億七千餘萬元。不必要支出予以裁撤，購置修繕費打七折，可减少五億餘元。核减裁减機構約計二十三億九千萬元，擬撤消（一）房屋租賃委員會，（二）警察局騎巡隊按預算除生活補助費外爲一億六千餘萬元，應予撤除而加强車巡隊，車巡隊預算爲一百六十四萬元，若增加兩隊則再加一億五千萬元。共計可减少一百零七億七千七百萬元，如此則實際預算爲七百三十九億三千九百萬元，但對於建設性事業費支出則照單接受。</p>
<p>收入方面，經審査結果應增加三十七億五千六百萬元。則實際收支不數數將爲一百八十七億九千三百萬元。</p>
<p>後經李參議員文杰，按收支增减方面分別統計報吿：建設性事業經費預算應爲二百六十八億元·計：敎育文化支出二十七億八千萬元，工務一百十九億元，公用十一億元，衛生六十九億元，社會三億二千萬元，保警十五億元，財政五億六千萬元，地政十一億元，再加公共汽車及小本貸金等五億元。</p>
<p>裁減支出原則有三</p>
<p>裁减支出之原則有三：（一）各局中將添而尚未錄用之人員一槪不予列入預算項內，（二）市府及各局各附屬機關共有工人九千人，工役三千五百人，其中工人應予酌减（三）獨立之各單位應儘量合併，如公用局之碼頭倉庫管理處等，裁减標準視情形而定。又如市參議會發給各議員每人交通費一萬元，由第九組審査會發起不領，雖節省支出僅二千數百萬元，然在節流原則下，亦表示參議員之以身作則。</p>
<p>至增加收入以不增加一般人民之負担爲原則。可增加者計有使用牌照稅，筵席稅，新車登記費，宰牲塲事業收入，淸潔收入等五種。</p>
<p>召集人報吿完畢後，有王參議員先靑報吿酒菜業同業公會請願要求减低百分之二十之筵席捐爲百分之十。並改自二萬元飯賬起捐，此外旅棧業同業公會亦請願免收旅棧捐。經財政局谷局長春帆解釋减低捐率可由參議會決定，但目前筵席捐收入每月達二十億元，除减半則將成十億元，半年六十億元，其缺額勢必另籌彌補。谷局長又說明旅棧捐本未由中央規定，乃臨參會決定，如旅棧捐免收，則居住旅館內之市民，將可不負担稅捐責任。</p>
<p>各組召集人　報吿與說明</p>
<p>旋由各組召集人相繼報吿及說明各項設施所需增加預算。經審査會討論後初步議決：警務方面，要求增加消防費十億元，因消防事大，勝利後消防處僅添購若干皮帶，故除已撥五億元正定購器材外，再予增加五億元。</p>
<p>房屋租賃委員會預算計一千三百萬元（生活補助費不在內）第十組審査法規委員會召集人等不贊成取消並提議尙應增加仲裁組，蓋取消後若分發遣散費，則無補於節流，但若干議員認爲不論節省開支多少，應裁縮之機構必予撤消，經審査結果交大會決定除留。</p>
<p>敎育文化經費佔總預算百分之十九·一七，要求增加至百分之二十五，未予通過。又私立學校因學費收取過大，補助費亦不予增加。社會救濟包括婦女救濟由第七組提出要求增加九億元，審査會認爲戰後上海滿目瘡　，而救濟事業費僅佔總預算百分之一·五六，實屬太少暫定通過列入預算內。工務公用經費因工程費暫時無法計算，擬將來再作估計。衛生經費仍按原預算辦理·</p>
<p>最後經審査會統計除收支實差一百八十七億元外，再加新列預算十五億元，共需二百零二億元。其彌補辦法將由市長交議徵收五項稅收中酌定，淸潔捐決主張撤消，跑馬捐尙未確定故不計。公用事業附加捐定四十億元，因徵收僅百分之十，方法輕而易舉而直接有利市政設施，故予贊同，所剩一百六十二億即須在房捐（議案中規定擬收一百八十億元）或市政捐（規定擬收一百五十億元）中徵收。目前除第三審査組初步議決徵收市政捐外，議員意見尙未趨一致，決交大會討論後決定。昨日全部審査結果，亦均將交大會議定。審査會至九時始散。</p>
<h3>今日議程</h3>
<p>今日上午市參議會舉行第十七次會議，下午第十八次會議，均將繼續討論有關金融，工商，經濟等提案。</p>
<h3>會場小插曲</h3>
<p>昨日上午，若干商民散發傳單，檢舉靜安寺奸僧德悟密迦；下午上海佛敎徒向市參議會散發請願宣言，反對民政處張曉崧違背法令。</p>
<p>上海市旅商業同業公會，散發兩種請願書，一種請求撤銷旅棧捐，另一種，請求改善該業現行薪工制。酒菜業公會也派代表請願。</p>
<p>瞿鉞說。「討論時最後發言的人，最容易得到勝利，這是開會秘訣，請大家注意」。</p>
<p>限期檢舉漢奸爲昨日討論最熱烈的一幕，馮有眞說：「我國倘若一二十年後仍在慢慢的處理漢奸，豈不是丟盡火下的臉。」</p>
<h3>八百和尚　列隊請願　撥用寺廟一節　要求提會重議</h3>
<p>市參議會昨日下午開會討論提案之前，本市各寺廟和尙代表的八百名，前以參議會討論民字第三號提案請市府配撥自治機稱辦公房屋中辦法有「撥用或借寺廟」一節，表示不滿，列隊遊行，並至市參議會會塲請願，此八百和尙並推由福善白聖等五和尙人會塲代表請願。昨下午三時大會繼續舉行時，主席即首先報吿和尙及旅館業等請願事項，並穴佈由民政組召集人接見，旅館業等則由工商金融組接見，再行擬具意見，提會發表，和尙代表則請求前議民字第三號提案再行提會重議，接見議員當予接受，四時許此八百和尙即行列隊離去。</p>
<p>又據警局民政處陳科長語滬光社記者稱：關於張曉崧處長，於參議會上提出撥寺廟充區公所辦公處之提案，在法律上並非絕無根據，緣內政部在前數年曾頒發寺廟佛敎管理辦法，內有於必要時可撥寺廟充公共事業辦公處之規定，且對一般淫廟淫寺，可予以沒收充公·故佛敎徒之請願等等，純屬「則知其一不知其二」云。</p>
<h3>參議會唇槍舌劍熱烈討論　通過限期檢與漢奸　決定辦法七項提請中央採納施行　贊成者以八十票佔多數</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕市參議會昨日上午舉行第十五次會議，對民字第十五號「擬請中央限期澈底檢舉淸査漢奸，依法懲處，並對已被檢舉或已在押之漢奸速爲公開訊辦審判，以張國法，而平民憤」一案，繼續展開激烈之辯論。重點仍在於應吾限期的問題上。參議員間顯然分成贊成和反對兩個陣營，雙方唇槍舌劍，勢均力敵。贊成的一面更有主張修正辦法和補充另外意見的。</p>
<p>贊成派放第一砲的開路先鋒是姜懷素，他以律師身份說明贊成限期決不是想予漢奸以方便，而是求加緊檢舉。他說：「我們抗戰八年，難道會替漢奸辯護嗎？我個人復業以來，就從沒有接受過替漢奸辯護的案子」。</p>
<p>徐永祚會計師惟法是重，他主張照原案通過，但是須經過立法程序，不能以命令出之。</p>
<p>馮有眞爲加强發言的效果，特地走上主席台來，並且預先請主席多給他一二分鐘的時間。他說：「勝利以後，政府對於辦理漢奸案件不够積極不够澈底，所以我主張規定期限，加緊進行。試看法國的情形，巨奸如貝當賴伐爾在戰事一結束後即判刑法辦，其餘的小奸亦都經判決執行。而中國則直到現在還在檢舉，如果這樣無限期拖延下去，將成何現象？並且，許多漢奸往往搖身一變成爲地下工作人員，如果再拖下去，漢奸更可以領勳章了」。他提出六項修正辦法提交大會討論。</p>
<p>王延松特別提出上星期陶百川所說「亂」的情形，他說檢舉漢奸亦是太亂，規定期限後可以安定人心。</p>
<p>童襄補充馮有眞的意見，提議由中央調査機關協助檢舉。</p>
<p>反對派開始發言</p>
<p>反對派第一員大將何成甫滔滔不絕，限定時間的鐘聲響了三次，他還意猶未盡，議長請他勿作題外之言，並再給予一分鐘的寬限。他的意見比較瑣碎，大意是說限期檢舉，對於漢奸似乎有利，參議會應代表多數民衆，否則將爲「反動份子」攻擊之口實。他說到東北漢奸至今尙未檢舉，又說到秦檜後代曾請求僞政府銷毀鐵像。最後又說祇有漢奸陷害忠良，沒有忠良陷害漢奸。</p>
<p>王立本駁斥王延松安定人心的說法，他說：「老百姓不會不安心，祇有漢奸才不安心。至於檢舉工作加緊不加緊亦不在乎是否限期」。</p>
<p>賈德超的意見與何成甫相近，他也認爲如果參議會通過限期檢舉，恐怕外界會發生懷疑或攻擊</p>
<p>鍾玉良怪聲怪氣</p>
<p>鍾玉良怪聲怪氣的也來反對，但所說理由有些「風馬牛」不相及，他把漢奸分成三種：一種是本來有錢現在依舊是闊老，一種是本來窮光蛋現在成了闊老，又有一種則太來窮光蛋現在依舊是窮光蛋。</p>
<p>陳存仁也駁斥限期檢舉可以安定人心的說法，他並擬大談其何謂漢奸，主席吿以條例已有規定不必說了。</p>
<p>在宣佈停止討論的時候，龔雨亭堅特發言一次，他認爲中國情形不能與法國相比，漢奸隱匿於鄕僻之區的也要儘量檢舉。</p>
<p>最後主席將贊成限期和反對限期兩種相反意見提付表決。空氣從緊張恢復了靜穆，贊成派以八十票的多數獲得勝利（到會人數一百二十四人）。</p>
<p>七辦法討論通過</p>
<p>原則上限期是決定了，辦法又經過一番詐細的討論。根據馮有眞所提六點删削修正另外添加童襄利路式導兩點補充，最後決定的辦法共爲七點：</p>
<p>（一）擬請中央酌定檢舉漢奸之期限。</p>
<p>（二）擬請中央公佈各收復地區在淪陷期間因地下工作而參加僞政府人員之眞名及化名，以免漢奸於法辦時，往往藉口擔任地下工作希圖卸罪。</p>
<p>（三）凡依法檢舉之漢奸有顯著罪證者，如未能應傳到案應即下令通緝·</p>
<p>（四）已被檢舉之漢奸應從速處理、對一般巨奸尤不應寬縱。</p>
<p>（五）已經判決之漢奸應從速執行</p>
<p>（六）請中央負責調査漢奸機關迅速公佈尙未被檢舉漢奸之姓名，並將其罪行送交地方法案以作偵訊之參考。</p>
<p>（七）擬請中央令飭各機關及各團體對於偽組織時期內相同機構之漢奸負責檢舉並獎勵人民之密吿</p>
<p>兩插曲臨時動議</p>
<p>辦法通過以後，又有兩項插曲：（一）詹文滸另外有些意見作爲臨時動議，他認爲無論贊成反對，目的都在加强檢舉，所以主張由參議會來一次總檢舉，在第二次會議時提出。結果因時間關係，上午未及討論。（二）休息十分鐘後繼續開會時陶百川突然提出要求複議辦法第一條，他認爲這一條規定太空泛。法律上對於刑事犯的檢舉有二十年的規定，如果市府把漢奸檢舉期限縮短太甚，豈非太便宜了漢奸。他主張保留馮有眞的原來提議而在討論時被删削的「軍事漢奸政治漢奸及特工漢奸等爲害人民者不在限期之例」，但贊成的寥寥無幾，複議未能實現。</p>
<h3>建議政府從速改善金融政策　决推派代表晉京請願　大會昨討論提案並通過臨時動議五件</h3>
<p>昨日下午，參議會繼續討論金字第四號至第十號提案並通過臨時動議五件。</p>
<p>金字第四號提案係「建議政府從速改善金融政策，積極辦理生產貸款，及農村貸款，壓平黑市高利，以减低成本，穩定物價解救工商艱困，以免經濟崩潰案」。大會決議通過，解市府轉呈中央迅速切實施行，陶百川認爲一紙公文，難收宏效，建議推派代表晋京請願。大會通過，並決定派遣十一名代表。至於代表人選，決議由議長先擬定名單，提交今日大會表決。</p>
<p>金字第五號提案係「爲耙念勝利第二週年，擬於明年九月三日在上海舉行國際工業展覽會案」</p>
<p>防止銀行錢莊　付出鈔票缺少</p>
<p>金字第六號提案，案由爲「請市府通令銀行公會錢業公會，採取有效辦法，防止銀行錢莊付出鈔粟缺少，以免科紛案」。審査意見爲「擬請議長函本市銀錢兩業商業同業公會通吿會員切實注意」。大會無異議通過。</p>
<p>金字第七號提案，案由經修正後，改爲「函請市府轉請財政部，對於原定進口物品，限制規定嚴格執行，其申請進口之外貨，應將進口稅酌予調整，以維民族工業案」大會決議，原則通過。</p>
<p>工廠趕速開工</p>
<p>金字第八號提案係重提臨參會舊案，請中央迅將接收之敵僞工廠，趕速開工，並鼓勵民營工廠復業，以容納失業工人，而資增加生產。決議通過。</p>
<p>金字第九號提案，係關於改革金融機關從業員保險制度，建議採用特種現金保證制度。因辦法中規定，從業員舞弊案發生後，職務上有關同事應受連帶處分，瞿鉞及姜懷素等認爲欠妥，關於「應按月薪三倍之數額，繳納保證金」一點應有間題。大會決議，暫將本案保留，交第四及第十兩組，會同審査。</p>
<p>金字第十號提案，係准上海市商會公函，向市府建議，將市商會請願事項，轉呈中央迅予實施案，大會決議通過，與第四號提案合併辦理。</p>
<p>變賣敵產所得　提成建設上海</p>
<p>討論臨時動議五件。（一）係金潤庠等所提，「爲保障工人生活，安定社會秩序，擬呈准中央指定國家銀行舉辦工人團體失業保險」。無異議通過。（二）詹文滸提議，由參議會對本市漢奸作一次總檢舉，大會決議否決，認爲無需由參議會另設機構。後由潘議長提議，作一決議案：「通知全體參議員，就自己所知，儘量迅速檢舉漢奸」。全塲一致鼓掌通過。（三）姜豪等提，擬請市府儘先量才錄用本市蒙難同志，以慰忠貞案」，決議通過。（四）金潤庠等提對非法強佔民房各機關，限期遷　案，決議通過。（五）係兩案所歸併，其一爲姜懷素等所提，請中央將敵僞產業處理局上海區變賣之款項，提撥十分之五，充作本市建設文化，工業之用。陶百川等人之提案係請撥十分之一，唯陶氏最後附議前一提案，大會決議通過。遂吿散會。</p>
<h3>討論澈查房地產公司　緊張中笑話百出　舌戰一場結果願意案保留</h3>
<p>休息後討論金融方面的提案，第一案爲陳公達所提建議澈査敵僞時期成立之各房地產公司人事組織及資本來源。討論時緊張中「笑話百出。」</p>
<p>先是，審査小組對於本案的意見是暫行保留，請原提案人提供事實。大會中陳公達提出事實來了，他說房地產公司中敵僞奸述之資本祗要地政局社會局加以澈査就可水落石出，據悉現在百分之七十五以上的業主都已不是戰前的業主，他並且具體舉出了一家公司名稱來。</p>
<p>張學濂却站起來主張將本案撤銷，他認爲敵僞產業已有專門機構處理，本案不必提出。</p>
<p>主席問有人附議撤銷否？金潤庠舉手附議，張志韓却站起來說：「我不附議！」主席笑起來了，他說：「我問的是有沒有附議，不附議的可不必說。」全塲哄堂大笑。</p>
<p>笑聲過後空氣又歸緊張，陳公達聲色俱厲的站起來，他說：「主張撤銷的與房地產公司方面有沒有關係？如果有關係的應該　避。」但他的話並未引起反應。</p>
<p>主席將撤銷的動議提付表決，贊成者僅三十七票，未能實現。</p>
<p>瞿鉞發表意見說：「我本人與房地產公司並無關係，但我不贊成騷擾人民。」</p>
<p>張學濂又說：「要澈査就不單是房地產公司，一切公司都要査。」</p>
<p>其餘發表意見的很多，有人對原則加以反對，有人斤斤於文字上的修正，情形相當混亂。</p>
<p>主席決定將否決本案的動議提付表決時，張志韓又說得滿塲大笑。他說：「案由不是已經通過了嗎？「席說：「並沒有通過呀，撒銷是一回事，否決又是一回事。」</p>
<p>表決結果，贊成否決的僅四十七票，不通過，於是討論如何修正。</p>
<p>討論如何修正時又是議論紛紛，有人接連發言幾次。陸蔭初看不順眼，突然站起來一手持議事規則，厲聲大喊：「請大家注意，根據議事規則，每人發言不得超過兩次以上！」</p>
<p>好容易終於歸納出一個修正案，提付表決時又僅少數贊成。</p>
<p>撤銷，不通過。否決，不通過。修正，又不通過。主席笑着說：本案祗好提議保留了。</p>
<p>參議員們都笑了，在笑聲中紛紛舉手決定了本案保留的命運。</p>
<p>上午餘下的時間中又討論了兩個提案，第二案收回外國專利營掌權，如英法商電力公司自來水廠電公共汽車等，保留至第五組提案中合併討論。第三案則修正爲籌建各區平民商塲並重行劃定攤販區械以整飭市容案·。大會決議，原則通過，送市府轉請經濟部辦理。</p>

<h3>盆湯弄橋梅閘橋　工務局招標承修</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕對於改善中區交通，實施以來，屢經有關各局會商檢討，情形漸趨良好，惟尙有數點，經記者往訪公用局負責人，承吿如次：（一）改善中區交通實施辦法內之罰則，祇限中區適用，其他各區，仍按各種車輛管理規則辦理，（二）對不按規定停車者，由崗警抄號報吿分局，通知處罰，不再沒收照會。（三）北京東路禁止運貨卡車行駛辦法，凡不載貨之自備載客大汽車及機動送貨小車，則不在此限。並爲疏暢蘇州河南北交通，减少其他各橋車輛擁擠，開放盆湯弄橋及老閘橋，殊屬必要。將由工務局招標承修二月完工，即可正式通行，至明圓明園路等改爲單程交通，及如何改善外白渡橋橋面計劃，併待工務局詳細硏究後，再行決定。</p>

<h3>管理汽車加油站　市政會議通過辦法</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市管理汽車加油站（包括附設打氣站）辦法，業經上次市政會議通過，其主要規則如下：（一）道路兩旁人行道上不得設置汽車加油站。（二）凡在私地建造汽車加油站，須先繪具詳細地址佈置圖，塡具登記書，由工務，地政，警察三局審査，核准後由工務局發給營造執照。領執照時應繳納執照費，執照有效期爲一年。（三）抽油器及打氣器上應各裝電燈一盞，並須標明危險及禁止吸烟等字樣。（四）公用局對於汽車加油站得隨時派員檢査。（五）自用之汽車加油站不得將汽油出售或轉給他人。營業之汽車加油站出售汽油之品質及容量務須適合標準，不得有攙和劣油及短少容量等弊竇。（六）公用，工務，地政，警察四局，對於已設立汽車加油站，如認爲有遷移之必要時，得由公用局令其遷移，其一切費用由該站主負祖。（七）汽車加油站執照，須懸掛於站內顯明之地位，以便檢査？（八）汽車加油站有違背規則者，按其輕重予以處分。（九）犯有下列情形之一者，均可能處以吊銷執照：自用汽車加油站私自營業或轉給他人使用者，營業之汽車加油站所售汽油比較所呈之油樣爲劣者，營業之汽車加油站所售汽油之容量，査有偸漏或其他舞弊情事者。（十）凡受吊銷執照之處分者，應於限定期間將油站及一切附設建築物完全拆除，其以遵限辦理者，得由公用局處理之。上項規則，在公用局與警察局合作下，自即日起實行。並經兩局硏討結果，認爲本市老閘，黃　，泰山三　，一律不准添置汽車加汕站。</p>
<h3>沿蘇州河黃浦江　全部潮門已修竣</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市地勢低　，高潮時，潮水倒灌溝渠，路面較低者，如四川路，九江路口，廣東路自江西路至四川路一段，及日昇樓附近等處，每逢暴雨，溢水爲患。前公共租界，曾於各溝渠出口處建立潮門，以防潮水倒灌，但以年久失修，已失效用。現工務局沿蘇州河兩岸、黃浦江自虹口浜至中正路沿岸，曁虹口浜西部，全部裝修潮門，共計一百六十四座。第一期工程，業於八月杪完竣，在第一期改建潮門效力範圍內，各低窪馬路，已不見積水，惟浙江路當垃圾橋北堍溝管出口處之潮門窖井內，於潮門關閉後，潮水不能流人，遂由井中溢出，汎濫路面，現工務局擬在蘇州河出口處，再建潮門一座，以資防止。又蘇州路及北蘇州路，在浙江路以西一段，由於駁岸較低，大潮時水過岸頂，故須加高路面或駁岸，以工程較鉅，限於經費，目前恐難興工。至舊法租界鉅鹿路，茂名南路，長樂路，陝西南路等處，現仍有潮水倒灌現象，係由肇嘉浜侵入，工務局現正在肇嘉浜日暉港口，建築閘壩及唧站，並開始興建舊法租界與南市交界潮門工程，上述工程完成後，本市積潦現象，即可大見改善。</p>
<h3>國際勞工大會　我代表今首途</h3>

<h3>地院遷法營房　市長尤爲設法</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市地方法院，戰後向係在北浙江路與高院合署辦公·地址狹小·而事務極忙，即法庭亦有不敷之感、早有遷出之議。近傳市府已允設法將　　理路法軍營房讓於該院，但又因產權略有糾紛，未獲實現。近據地院方面傳出消息·吳市長因目前市參議會正在開會期中·極爲忙碌，故曾表示於市參議會閉幕後，無論如何必爲地院努力設法，即或竟不能「撥用」，至少亦必使地院能「租賃」該址，以應急需。聞司法行政部謝部長對此事亦極表關心，亟欲速謀一解決之辦法。故地院喬遷，殆已勢在必行，新址離地檢處及看守所較近，工作上當亦可方便不少。</p>
<h3>水泥廠解僱工人　昨赴社會局請願</h3>

<h3>財政部解釋　透支額並無限制　亦並無必須保證之手續飭銀錢業善體法令原旨</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕市商會前所毛巾被單，內曵織造，手工棉織，襪器染，手帕織造，百貨商業等公會，聯名函請轉呈財政部，請收回行莊往來透支戶，須訂立契約及限額之成命一案，當經電呈財政部核辦。頃獲財部代電開：查本部近頒之管理銀行辦法內規定：商業銀行資金運用，應以貸放於農工礦生產，暨日用重要物品之運銷，及對外貿易產品之運銷等事業爲主要對象。並經規定：銀行承做上項放款，無論以貸放或透支方式辦理，均應於事前訂立契約。是對於銀錢行莊，應協助工商生產，已極爲重視。所定此項透支，應訂立契約一節，原爲健全行莊業務，暨使於查考起見，並無限制透支之意。且透支原屬契約行爲，經本部令飭，訂立契約，不過以口頭契約改爲書面契約，並無若何困難。至以前所定每戶透支額，以法幣五百萬元爲限，係於抗戰初期，曾有此項限制。自卅年十二月修正非常時期管理銀行暫行辦法，暨頒訂管理銀行抵押及信用放款各辦法後，此種限額，即已取消。而自本年四月公布財政部管理銀行辦法以來，前頒之管理銀行抵押及信用放款各辦法，亦已一倂廢止。對於工商業向行莊透支，既無限額限制，亦無必須保證之規定。來電所稱各節，殊多誤會。本部前據上海市銀錢業公會於本年七月間呈，以上海銀錢業經營放款，其屬於質押或定期者，咸訂立契約。惟對於往來透支，習慣上向無契約。茲奉令須一律訂立契約，以客戶未悉底蘊，尚須接洽解釋，請自本年九月一日起，一體實施等情。經本部查核，所稱尚屬實情，應准照辦。惟嗣後務應恪遵規定辦理，不得違忽指令遵照在案。除再電令上海市銀錢業公會分轉各會員行莊善體法令原旨，妥爲辦理，不得稍有誤會暨遠忽外，仰即知照。市商會當據情轉行各關係公會，一體知照，妥洽辦理云。</p>

<p>美鈔初平後堅，晨初雖在三三六〇元左右徘徊，直至午刻此價仍吃屹立未動，傳有某大戶盡量吸收，於是午後，買氣頓熾，在乾涸之狀況下喊價立高，迨穿出三四〇〇元大關後，各種助買揣測紛起，而爭買之風亦更甚，千至三四八〇元而後小回，結果較前收好起七十元，港票亦被帶上，結果較前漲十元，港匯午前尚平，午後告俏在七一〇元左右，印匯八五〇元以上，英匯一一三〇〇元至一一五〇〇元，美匯仍站牌價，但少成交。</p>

<h3>廠絲最近成交價　美金七元二角半</h3>
<p>據悉：日絲在美存貨充斥下，一般廠商對絲價多認爲尚有下降趨勢，致吸胃轉弱，美政府曾於上週規定日本D級絲最低限價不能低於六元二角五分，故連日滬市絲價已較穩定，中蠶於十八日售於美商某洋行生絲二十餘包，價爲美金七元二角五分至七元五角，較美國最低價約高一元餘。</p>

<h3>紗銷愈活　市價跟漲三五萬坯布激漲五六千</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨日紗市益見堅挺，中小型紗成交頗不寥寞，京漢湘贛等幫，均有吸胃，人心異常興奮，紡建出品之位馬藍鳳水月日光等牌，尤爲俏利，因單純織廠採取原料，指明牌子，有捨此莫屬之概，綜觀念支紗除特製馬不動外，餘均上升三兩萬之譜，四十二支亦漲五萬，漲勢雖不狂暴，然腳地殊爲穩定，聞各紡廠之現貨，供應勢難圓活，因是其他各牌紗線，亦皆跟漲三五萬元不等。棉面高檔坯子，因紡建方面之龍頭迄無開出，而色布又屆旺銷季候，是以數日來激漲每疋五六千元光景。紡建開市仍照原盤，染織廠配細布，而布號業細布，則由四九九號至七〇〇號，金蓮嗶嘰亦有由四六號至八〇〇號云。</p>
<h3>紗布南運法已擬妥　正當廠商仍可作合理運銷粵省之走私路綫及其數量</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕記者頃訪紡織事業管理委員會業務處長劉文騰氏，叩詢本市紗市運銷華南實況。承談：關於紗布南銷情形，渠曾電請紡建駐粵代表詳查。據首次覆電稱：粵海關及貨物稅局，無上項統計。現經二次查覆結果，頗爲周詳，可分四點縷述：（一）穗城紗布，既全由上海運去。每月棉紗約一萬八千至二萬件，布約一萬件。入口棉紗，以十支廿支卅支佔大宗。卅二支四十二支細紗，僅佔少數。棉布以細布，染色布佔最多數。斜紋布，藍布，各色花色次之。沖嗶嘰又次之。（二）以銷紗言，因土布出口免稅，穗禪一地之土布製造，甚爲發達。各地銷紗，廣州每月可銷一千五百件。佛山每月可銷二千件。四邑各縣銷數甚少，每月僅五六十件，但梧州每月約銷二三千件。東江各縣，以惠州興寗等縣銷數較多，約達千件。至於銷布，以廣州紡建分處售出之數量言，廣州佔百分之卅，梧州佔百分之十五，四邑佔百分之五，東江等處佔百分之十，香港佔百分之四十。（三）廣州紗布，一向禁運港澳。惟投機取巧者，多向海關報運中山，小杭，三埠，再轉運澳門。報運東莞，常平，轉運香港。報運海口，湛江，轉運安南。均無正式經由海關運銷越港澳者。（四）最近香港本地紗布之出口，亦在禁例。但曾經申請入口者，當可根據報運出口。故私梟之走私路綫，隊第三綫外，亦由廣九鐵路及廣九公路，經深圳，與特殊勢力者合作，直運香港。但是項不經澳門之紗布，祗能供銷香港一隅。惟聞香港當局，對於港地存量豐時，亦可酌情准予出口。估計每月走私數量，當在穗市入口紗布之半數。</p>
<p>又據告：紡管會自於九日奉行政院命草擬棉紗布輸往華南暫行管理辦法後，業已會同關務署長張福運，擬具辦法。並已於上週六，送京呈核，刻正待政院核准頌行。渠稱：該一辦法之擬議，著眼於有根據，有實效，務求施行公允，管理科學化。俾正當廠商，仍能將紗布向華南一帶作合理之運銷云。</p>

<h3>健壽有術　我人何爲枉死</h3>
<p>— 雷特（Lawrence　lader)原著　載一九四六年六月號皇冠雜誌</p>
<p>吾人對於使用之汽車，　　時加以檢查，以　損壞，但於自己　身體何以須待病後方始注意，方始延　，不亦晚乎！</p>
<p>某君從未生病，平時亦當運動，乃在辦公室內忽然昏厥，一星期後，竟辭　世，享年不滿五十，如此死亡，實太不值得！蓋一切慢性疾病，潛滋暗長，患者多不自覺，但據醫學統計，若每年施行體格檢查，早期發現，及時治療，本可不致死亡：大多數之死亡，俱爲一種不必要之犧牲：吾人或自以爲體力甚健，步履若飛，毫無病態，殊不知大多數之殺人絕症，於事前多無警告，及一旦發覺，已太遲矣！紐約生命延長研究院約翰醫師報告：在一千例自以爲健康之商人，正在購置汽車或地產，然其中祗有一百十四人爲真正健康者，其中之十六例，則患病均已相當嚴重，因真正之殺人病症，大多數人均不加注意，故在不知不覺間，不知猛烈殺死多少人，吾人爲健康計，爲避免太不值得之死亡計，曷不每年施行一次體格檢查，在時間與精神上，毫無損失，而獲益無窮。檢查之價值，在預防疾病，摘發潛伏，許多絕症，若及早發現，極易治愈，例證甚夥。至檢查費用，亦不爲多，化戔戔之費，而博得健壽，又何樂不爲！處此科學昌明時代，若再枉死，不亦冤乎！</p>
<h3>吾人爲何放棄　不可估計的收穫　健康檢查之解剖</h3>
<p>吾人施行大规模健康檢查，人力方面，須有專門醫師三人，助理護士四人，事務員二人，書記一人，茶役三人，化騐師二人。物力方面，須具X光機一座，檢騐器械若干，病理化騐室全部，及房屋五間。宣傳方面，因民衆缺乏醫學常識，欲使苦海　病，及早回頭，俾診斷，以達健康之　，實非大諱疾呼不爲功。綜上三項支出，約計爲薪金四百〇二萬元，火食一百萬元，X光機之折舊及利息四百萬元，其他亦如之，宣傳費一百六十萬元，合計支出爲一千四百六十二萬元，而一個月爲本報讀者施行優待檢查，共計三四二人，總收入爲二百三十三萬元，然則此舉不將徒費金錢矣乎？曰否！吾人集中科學之貢獻，犧牲人力與物力，自有其不可估計之收穫在，謹爲諸君一陳，而試以事實證之。</p>
<p>日前申報史公館致電話於本院，謂有中央銀行某君，現住普通病房，已經三月，可否予以免費優待，經本院服務部調查，知某君兩肺均患有肺癆，經過相當治療，已告痊愈，惟現有肛門結合合併症，何時可愈，尚難預料，經濟如何預算，更難答覆。假使某君在一年以前，施行健康檢查，不但可免腸部感受傳染，使健康恢復，不致遙不可期，而陷經濟於窘迫，抑且一肺若能早期治療，其他一肺，或可不致波及，則當時所費於檢查者，不過三數次之三輪車費，即可獲得不可估計之健康幸福，乃坐失早期治療之黃金時期，及今而謀救濟，不亦晚乎！按職業階級中，不幸患此慢性疾病，致奪去個人健康，引起家庭社會之悲劇者，此種事實，本院成立十餘年來，數見不鮮，其傷心慘目，有非筆墨所可殫述者。如藝人英子小姐，非於秋海棠一劇飾梅寶一角，博得大眾之欣賞，而予以極深刻之印象者乎？乃因辛勞過甚，肺癆潛伏，迨X光檢查留院治療，，已發現如銀圓大之空洞五個，滿布兩肺葉間。綜其潛伏之期，當在一年以上，惜檢舉太遲，致留院治療，已歷三載，於其個人與藝術界之損失，何可估計？假使於一年以前因某種機會，而獲得X光診斷，因而早期治療，則三年以來，於藝術界之貢獻，又爲何如？設有讀者一人，無意中實行健康檢查，而其人發現潛伏病灶，因獲早期治療，不數月而就痊，不但自己重獲健康，早事生產，抑亦免却傳染他人，設在若干十年後，或爲一大事業家，或爲一大發明家，造福社會，嘉惠民眾，則其昔日無意中施行健康檢查之收穫，又何可估計哉？吾人此時之服務，故謂健康檢查，爲一種神聖工作，似亦不爲過也。</p>
<p>惜此不可估計之收穫，在目前一般民眾，猶多漠然無知，（觀乎上月讀者優待檢查人數之寡，即可</p>
<p>知之）即一般醫家亦不無懷疑，其實健康知識愈普通，則就醫者愈多，若人人於就醫之前，能先往各醫院施行各種檢查，得一正確病理報告，則在醫者可一覽無遺，而洞見癥結，省去不少手續，而病家因事前得有正確病理報告，更不致遷延時日，而達速治速愈之目的，彼此均可收事半功倍之效。況檢查而證明健康者，根本毋需再行求醫，則時間與經濟，其節省爲何如？彼英國人民之手健康證書一紙，豈無故哉？我國社會對於公共衛生，向鮮注意，專家如李廷安張維劉瑞恒諸氏雖言之諄諄，（見下文）但聽者藐藐，實堪痛心！方今世界各國人民，無不知爭取其個人之健康權，爲生存幸福之基，何以吾國人民獨忽視應享之健康，誠百思而不得其解，須知疾病之無形殺人，什百倍於有形之戰爭，且戰爭有終止之日，而人類與病魔之戰爭，永無盡期，在此科學昌明時代，吾人何爲不謀健康之保障，而自甘枉死乎？</p>
<p>倘每人能施行健康檢查，則疾病之發現愈早亦愈多，醫者之需要愈增，而枉死者亦愈少。檢查工作愈普遍，則醫者之業務必愈廣，而民眾之健康亦愈增進。檢查與醫者，猶魚之與水，二者不可或離，醫而無檢查，決不能正確之診斷及治療，病家若不施行檢查，則無由檢查潛伏之疾病，而隨時有一發不可收拾之危險。要之，檢查之利益，實不可估計，惟能收穫此利益者，乃屬之早期即行檢查之人。至吾人之工作，實僅耕耘而已耳！</p>
<h3>抗戰八年　軍民殉難三百一十萬人　犧牲於肺癆者　去年達四百五十萬人</h3>
<p>第二次世界大戰，予人類極大之恐怖與危險，其實癆病之危險，有過之而無不及。我國抗戰八年，死亡軍民經公佈者，總數不過三百一十萬人，但因癆病而致死亡者，去年一年內，估計約有四百五十萬人。有形之敵人，固然兇猛，而肉眼不能見之癆菌，實更爲可怕，更爲危險。就上海一隅而論，癆病之猖獗，實駭人聽聞。在民國卅一年前六個月內，當時英法兩租界居民癆病死亡人數爲二千二百六十九，而七種法定傳染病死亡人數之總和不過一千〇二。是則癆病一症之死亡率，超過七種傳染病死亡總數百分之一百四十一，六。現在侵略者雖已被逐境外，而更兇猛之敵人，則仍混跡吾人之家庭，機關，團體，工廠，學校，及整個社會國家，任其蔓延滋長，每年屠殺四五百萬無辜人民，而令其殘廢臥床褥者恐更十倍於是。猖獗如此之甚，其關係民族健康如何重大。況患此症者之年齡，大都均在二十至四十五歲之間，壯年有用之期，消磨於病床，經年累月，終至斷送生命，人力物力之損失，何能統計。上海一市如此，則其他各省市，更可想而知。吾人負有人民健康責任，安能熟視無覩，所望一般先知先覺及熱心社會人士，共同努力，撲殺此獠，庶可措民族於健康之域，而洗刷東亞病夫之恥也。</p>

<h3>肺癆病防治之近代觀（下）</h3>
<p>— 吳紹青</p>
<p>早期診治和公共衛生設備</p>
<p>肺癆之治癒可能性，隨病之輕重而異：早期者輕，晚期者重；輕者易治，重者難以挽救。吾人習常所見，凡來就醫者，大都爲晚期症候。蓋病者輕微時，並無嚴重病狀，甚至毫無病狀以促病者之注意；一旦病狀明顯而去就醫時，則易治時期往往亦已錯過。縱或稍能補救，平均四人中僅有一人耳。故大凡住肺病療養院之病人，屬於晚期癆症者約佔百分之八十五至九十之多，治癒之效率既微，而耗費金錢更鉅。經年累月成績有限。從整個防癆立場論之，是爲不智，且不經濟。改善之方，即在早期診治，治療效率既高，而病者所費金錢和時期均可節省；利弊得失，判若　廢。施行早期診治，必須選擇癆病率較高之團體，與肺癆病人接觸者以及感受性較高之人民，乘其病狀尚未發覺時，施以X光肺部檢查。最經濟且可靠之方法，乃用小型流動式之X光機，以美金計，每片衹價值四分。所尋出之早期病人，及早施以治療，付有限之代價，收莫大之效果。</p>
<p>有人謂現在患癆病都已如是之多，收容醫治已感供不應求，應付目前之需要，尚感困難，何必再事尋覓早期病人，更加重困難。此乃常人應有之疑問也。殊不知此等早期病人，如不尋出，及早醫治，則將來充塞於肺病醫院，無法醫治，而從久佔床位者，必是此等病人也。是則惡性循環，將無已時。猶之吾人徒救燎原之火，而不知曲突徒薪也。然則晚期病人，既如是之多，而治癒希望又如是之少。不收之入院，則有傳染他人之危險；收之住院，則停留又渺渺無止期，其處置又將如何。在衛生機構健全之國家，此等病人亦應收容於病院，其治療之可能性雖小，然猶能收隔離之功。我國民窮財竭，人力物力均極感困難，防癆之最低條件，尚未達到，焉能住此極有限之病院，作無止境隔離之用。況全國癆病人數之多，不下千百萬，而欲施行病院隔離，不啻杯水車薪，既不可能，且爲不智。代替辦法，衹能藉公共衛生護士之服務，就家庭中施以隔離依法，使病者生活習慣，皆仿照病院規律，尤其重要者，乃在防制傳染他人。此外再加診療所之設置，俾病人得有醫師診治之，隨時指導其休養方法。如此既可節省大量經費，又可兼顧隔離和療養之方。此法當非盡善，但在我國初步防癆其中，勢爲不可避免之階段也。將來病院普及，床位加多，此等晚期病人，必須收容院內，以收隔離之效。</p>
<p>診療所和療養</p>
<p>此兩項可相提並論，因其關係密切，而以治療爲主旨。談到治療方面，一般人首先欲問者，即癆症有無特效藥可治。美國近年來對於此項研究，特別重視。雖有若干藥品曾轟動一時，但用之於人體而具有特效功能者，迄今尚付缺如。吾人治療須仍憑已往之經騐，和新近之知識，對於　牙床靜養，　增進營養，　新鮮空氣；仍奉爲金科玉律。諸端雖屬舊調重彈，然時至今日，仍不可加以絲毫輕視。至於肺部壓縮療術，則方法不一，選擇之道，須視病症之對象如何，需定採用之。仁者見仁，智者見智，是在醫者之善於採擇運用也。普通一般病者，因缺乏癆病常識，動輒要求注射藥劑，以爲新法治癆，非打針不可。於是廣告藥品乃得機而逞，不顧道德，專作虛偽宣傳；而病者不察，易於輕信，所得者不過精神上之安慰，而於病狀癥結所在，決無絲毫補益。其求治心切，固可原，而愚實亦可憫也。金錢損失關係猶小，而錯過治療時期，則誠爲大不幸也。</p>
<p>肺癆病與別種病症不同，其痊愈逐漸而來，故其深淺程度均有嚴格之規定，並非病狀消失，即可謂病已痊癒。所以病者欲恢復工作，不能隨本人自覺之一般情形而定。有若干病人，因其固有職業妨礙健康，若再繼續此種工作，則病有復發之可能，故必設法調整之，或助其另擇職業，以恢復其生產和經濟能力，同時亦可減免肺病復發之可能。凡規模較大之療養院內，應有此項職業輔導機構。英國有癆病村之設，其中興辦各種工藝，由逐漸痊癒之病人，在醫師之指導下，參加工作。美國零星舉辦者亦有幾處。現在此種工作逐漸大量發展。我國工業落後，經濟狀況極其不安，在此情形下面欲興辦此種有規模之機構，恐非易事。然亦可視各地之局部情形如何，酌量由私人或團體倡辦。將來逐漸推廣，取得勞資雙方之協助，達成健全機構，以完成癆病防治程序中之最後一環。英國於一九四三年，經唐林生之提案得法律上之規定，凡肺癆病失業人民，除家庭之生活及子女之贍養，得有政府津貼外，其本人職業之恢復，亦得政府資助。美國數省亦有類似之救濟辦法。其目的在求醫者住院得以安心養病，無家庭經濟之擔負，及本人失業之顧慮。必如此，病者善後復原苛作方可謂徹底，而癆病防治中之最高的，亦可謂達到矣。</p>
<p>以上所舉工作概況，不過就原則早申述之，至於實施方案，則視人力財力及物力之程度如何而定。在今日之中國，此三者均感極度缺乏，欲求普遍舉辦，勢所不能。然各地情形不一，不如就此三種條件能達到相當程度之區域，擇而辦之。一方面推行工作，同時造就人才，以求逐漸推廣，此種工作，性質廣泛，規模宏大，非少數肺病醫師能濟事，亦非政府衛生行政機構所能單獨勝任。即使地方有防癆協會之設，雖旨趣相同，亦不過能做到一面抗癆，非集合全國人之力量不可，無論機關之爲官立或民辦，凡以防癆爲宗旨者必須竭其所有，通力合作。成尤爲重要者，即爲熱心社會事業人士之支持。美國防癆總會，一民眾團體，去年所捐募之經費達美金一千七百萬元之鉅，其來源全由民眾之自由捐助，政府並未撥給分文。其公民之責任心，由此可見。吾人應認癆症爲吾人之公敵，地無分南北，人無分男女，年無分老幼，一心一德，全力赴之，則癆症之撲滅可期。抗日之精神如此，抗癆之精神更當如是也。</p>
<h3>癆病的治療　精神因素</h3>
<p>— 夏鎮夷</p>
<p>癆病治療的要著，便是盡人皆知的「休息」。可是我知道有不少人對休息沒有深切的了解。他們往往身體雖在床上休息，可是他們的頭腦仍在不停地計劃著他的事業，相信他的愛人，焦慮著自己的病況，顧慮著醫藥的負擔，總之，思慮萬端，此起彼伏，使神經沒有片刻的安靜，這實是一般肺結核患者共同的通病，也是在治療上一個嚴重的障礙。我們知道整個的人是包含著身心二方面的，只有身體的休息，而沒有心理或精神的休息，不是完全的休息，不是真真的休息。</p>
<p>癆病治療，除了「休息第一」外，「營養」也是醫治的必要條件。大生理學家開農氏（Canuon）曾證明精神與身體關係的密切，恐懼，焦慮，悲哀等情緒，可刺激腎上腺素的分泌過多，而產生心跳，發汗，瞳孔放火，血糖增加，腸胃蠕動與分泌停頓等生理現象，因了腸胃蠕動與分泌的停頓，結果胃納減退，消化障礙，以致全身的營養發生了嚴重的威脅。這又給予治療癆病一種障礙。</p>
<p>我常見有許多患者，當發生了咯血的現象，便驚惶失措，像被判了死刑一般，終日哭哭啼啼，飲食不思。其實咯血是肺結核的警鐘，並不一定是病入膏肓的預示。你須趕快就醫檢查，才是最好的辦法。假使你徒起無謂的恐懼與憂慮，無異於你自己摧毀了精神的堡壘，使病菌有乘機擴大侵入的機會，因此無形的斷送了你能治癒的良機。不知有多少輕微的肺結核患者，當醫生告訴他肺部有病時，而起恐懼焦慮，就因了這種精神因素，使易於治癒的初期結核患者，迅速的轉入嚴重不治的地步，這是何等的愚蠢！</p>
<p>在精神病學的見地看來，我常遇到許多焦慮狀態，神經過敏或神經衰弱及其他種種神經官能病，以及嚴重的精神憂抑症發生於肺結核的患者。考其原因，乃由於肺結核而起無謂的恐懼焦慮與沮喪，而使神經長時期的緊張。健康是人人所企求的，身體上既有了病，憂慮是徒然的，相反的卻釀成嚴重的精神病態，更使治療上又多了一重障礙。</p>
<p>焦慮與恐懼是替癆病菌開了方便之門，聰明的患者們，千萬要提防。身心是不可分的，我們須有達觀的生人，愉快的心情，鎮靜的態度，來克服你的敵人——結核病魔。</p>
<h3>人與病菌之戰（三）</h3>
<p>— 喬樹民著</p>
<p>摘自「傳染病管理」</p>
<p>（三）感覺性及抵抗力</p>
<p>吾人置身於自然界，日與病菌相接觸之機會，不可勝計，幸吾人具有抗戰能力，足資防禦，不致完全感受傳染。此種抵抗力，關係於傳染病管理者甚大，茲分普通抵抗力，特殊抵抗力，及與抵抗力有關之副因素三方面，略述之：</p>
<p>（一）普通抵抗力</p>
<p>A.完整的皮膚——大多數的病菌，均不能繁殖於完整的皮膚上，亦不能破膚而入體內。據Arnold等氏之研究，正常之皮膚，皆呈酸性反應（PH5.8-5.2　），足以消滅普通病菌，故皮膚實稍有自淨作用，大概汗液之化學性質，亦與此作用有關。</p>
<p>B.完整的粘膜——粘膜每爲病菌侵入人體之門，但亦非全無抵抗力者。</p>
<p>（1）口腔及腸胃部份——口腔之粘膜，皆有粘膜液。其中所含之膠質的粘液素，及口腔所分泌的唾液，均有保護及凈化異物之作用。倘病菌吞入食道，以至於胃；則胃液恒具有極強之殺菌作用，惟對於有蠟質保護之結核菌或阿米巴蟲之類，無所施其力耳。但在體溫過高時，胃酸每每降低，是故瘧疾或麻診等病之後，常繼發痢疾或其他腸胃病，殆即由於此種緣故。正常之小腸，亦不含菌，惟體溫過高或甲種維生素缺乏時，小腸之粘膜的生理作用，每失其正常的平衡，而易於感受傳染焉。</p>
<p>（2）鼻咽喉及氣管部份——由於鼻部之構造的特異，吸來的細菌，大部均停落鼻孔附近，其得進入之細菌，亦多粘著於粘膜，由於粘液及絨毛之清除作用而達口腔。故氣管內之空氣，在正常狀態下，多爲無菌。</p>
<p>（3）眼結膜部份——眼淚顯然有清掃侵入之病菌的功能。又眼淚有含有溶菌酵素甚富，足以毀滅一般的病菌。</p>
<p>（4）生殖道粘膜部份——尋常尿道，均不含病菌，以有尿液之沖　作用及尿液酸性反應之殺菌作用也。腔部之分泌液，殺菌力亦甚強，但於花柳病及產褥熱類的病菌。則無力抵抗耳。</p>
<p>C.噬菌作用</p>
<p>三年發現人體之噬菌作用，此項作用，對於吾人之抵抗一般傳染病，極關重要。常病菌侵入人體後，與體內之白血球相　遇，病菌（或其他異份）實具有一種吸引白血球的力，所謂趨化性（Cpsonin），此噬菌素引起某種病菌的物理性的變化，因此招致病菌作用云。</p>
<p>D.網腺內表皮系的功能</p>
<p>網膜內表皮系細胞，如脾體細胞，肝臟之Kupfer細胞，淋巴腺，骨髓，腎上腺，及血管之內表皮細胞，均屬之。此類細胞之游離者（Histiocyte），可捕一般白血球噬菌力之不足，能補殺剩餘之病菌及戰傷之白血球，而形成一般的肉芽組織（Granulation　tissuo），如於結核，梅毒，麻疹等病中所見。又此類細胞，對於清掃血內病菌之功能亦至大。並能消滅病菌之毒素，而產生抗體。大約有幾種殺菌藥，如奎寧之類，其藥理作用，頗仰賴於此網膜內表皮系細胞的功能。</p>
<p>E.生理的排泄作用——患者自糞，尿或膽汁等，排泄病菌及其毒素，亦爲普通的抵抗病菌現象之一。</p>
<h3>肺癆治療的原理</h3>
<p>— 孫忠亮</p>
<p>身體上任何一部分的損傷，要使它痊癒復原，頂緊要的條件是「休息」。最明顯的例子是手或腳的損傷，我們都知道不讓它運動，以期早日復原。這個「休息」的基本原則，也適用在肺癆病的治療上，而且是在目前癆病特效療法尚未發明前的最重要條件。</p>
<p>肺臟是一個呼吸器官，它日夜不停地膨脹收縮的運動著。當它有病損壞時，我們無法用意志去控制它，使它不動，以達到完全休息。於是不得不求其次，使它減少運動，得到部分休息。肺部運動的程度，是依據全身體力與腦力活動的情形（新陳代謝的程度）而決定。呼吸的使命是在供給全身活動所需要的氧，和排除它活動的副產物二氧化碳。顯而易見的，全身的活動增強，氧的需要多，二氧化碳的產生亦多，於是肺的運動也增加。休息能使肺部呼吸的次數，深度和力都減少。肺癆病患者的休息，是指全身的休息。身臥床上，腦子也要戒思慮，才能得到良好的休息，因爲思想也需要能力增加新陳代謝的。至於世俗所主張的清晨起來散步或作深呼吸運動，尤其是後者，增加肺部運動，對休息的原則北道而馳，切切不可嘗試的。</p>
<p>休息除掉上述對肺癆病治療的消極作用外，還有它的積極意義存在。全身活動減低後，全身以及肺部的血液和淋巴液的循環也減退，因此由病灶部分吸收的毒素也減少，於是全身中毒症狀如發熱·盜汗·咳嗽·吐痰亦可以因休息而減少。至於一般的說，臥床要使胃口減退，或甚至於妨礙消化，實在是沒有根據的。再進一步，肺部病灶周圍血液和淋巴液循環減退和停滯，可能促使纖維組織的增生，這是結核病灶癒合的元素。呼吸減低，血液循環減弱，都能使病灶部分氧的供給減少，結核桿菌是靠氧活命的，在這種情形之下，它的活動力也減退，繁殖率大減。這些都是休息對於肺癆病痊癒的益處。</p>
<p>起床活動須根據醫師的處方，它佔據臥床休養和開始工作的中介，必定要等療養到一適當時期，才可能遵醫囑後履行的，運動時間的久暫和它的性質範圍，都要看病灶的情形和病人一般情況決定的。</p>
<p>壓縮治療（Collapse　Theropy）雖非肺癆的特效療法，在目下確是治療此病的一大幫助，人工氣胸術（Artiflcial　Pneumothorax）是將氣體灌入胸膛，使肺量縮小，病灶部分鬆馳而獲休息，它周圍血液和淋巴液的停滯更有助於纖維組織的增生而包圍病灶，而同時減少結核毒素的吸收，以減退全身的中毒症狀；肺空洞因通它的枝氣管扭曲或阻塞，因而癒合，終至於消滅，不過人工氣胸術要獲得良好的結果，必須要肺髒和肋膜沒有黏連。少量的黏連可能用電烙術割斷（Pneumolysis）而使病肺部分得到良好的壓縮，橫隔神經的手術（Phrenci　Operation）以麻痹橫膈膜的運動，而使肺之下部獲得壓縮，亦是促成病肺休息的一種方法。胸腔成開術（Thoracoplasty）是進一步的將病肺部分的肋骨切除，胸壁下陷，減少肺量，亦是使病肺部分獲得休息爲目的。這種種的壓縮療法，大都是施行在病灶已潰瘍或成空洞的病例。它們的選擇要看病灶和病人一般情形和經濟情形而決定，並沒有一定的方式可循。同時因爲它們都不是肺病的特效療法，換言之，不是說施行手術後，就和胃腸炎開刀後霍然病除痊癒，我們依舊不能忘掉一般休息這基本原則，全身休息還是要聽醫囑切實履行，方能使病肺早日痊癒。</p>
<p>此外的外科治療，近年來已有將病肺或肺葉截除（Pneumonectomy　or　Lobectomy）的趨向，這是一個大手術，經專家慎重考慮後，始可應用。</p>
<p>營養是療治肺癆病的第二要素。我們要的是一般的均衡食物，包括適量的脂肪蛋白質，碳水化合箋，礦物質維生素等要素。患者固然需要較常人更多的營養，但並不需要每餐必是山珍海味，雞鴨魚肉，我們要求一份稍較平常豐富的均衡食物。加以休息，便可使體重逐漸增加，自水准下的重量加至稍稍高於一般的標準，而不希望太過於標準重量。體重增加固然是一個好現象，但並不一定表示病灶癒合。這是治療期中應加注意的一點，以免因之忽略休息。</p>
<p>涼爽的空氣（不是冷空氣）能刺戟生機，使病人精神愉快，這是療治肺癆的第三要素。至於易地療養，得考慮其他更重要的條件和如當地治療的設施和患者經濟情形後才能決定。</p>
<p>最後，關於藥物治療，截止目前特效藥尚未試騐成功。結核病理情形特殊，使藥物不易致效，而一般組織破壞程度很深的癆病，恐亦不是藥物所能治癒的，壓縮治療在這類病例中，恐仍將保持它的地位。</p>

<h3>奴隸的血（小說）</h3>
<p>— 王紀</p>
<p>樓板上一灘血。</p>
<p>一灘奴隷的血。</p>
<p>是中秋節前一晚從阿花的脈管里流出來的鮮血。</p>
<p>阿花是個十四歲的女孩子，去年年底邊母親用三斗米換進來的。不知道是哪地方人，聽口音離這兒不遠；沒有姓，據她自己說從小人家都喚她阿花，剛正和我家養的這條花狗一個名兒。可怪的是「人的阿花」來不久，一狗的阿花』就走掉了。「人的阿花」就替代了「狗的阿花」。</p>
<p>甚至於人不如狗。</p>
<p>阿花不算不伶俐，也不算不懂事，但和所有的孩子一樣免不掉頑皮。淘米，拎水，燒飯，倒馬桶，免强都來，但每一項上總忘不了撒野：淘米的時候會漾漾魚，捉得了一枚就「少爺少爺」地嚷進來，結果是母親的一頓駡，速我這點興頭也給澆冷了。燒火的時候她會拿木炭條在灶壁上塗鴉：人頭，「天」字，狗不像狗猪不像猪的東西，我猛地想起在大學里唸的心理學，而母親給她的總是一頓臭駡。</p>
<p>母親是個出身微寒的舊式女人，五十歲開外了。她始終反對我們二十多歲的人還唸書，反對和我新結婚的玲玲去當敎員。她極少和外界接觸，終年默默地　植，養蠶，替人縫衣服；她對於女子所持的哲學觀點是：無才便是德。</p>
<p>自然，她希冀於玲玲和阿花的也是這一些。</p>
<p>有一次，母親叫阿花穿一枚針，不小心針給掉了。母親在極度憤恨下冷冷地下了一道命令：</p>
<p>「找不到你休想吃飯」！</p>
<p>我們吃過二餐了，阿花還蹲在地上摸呀摸的。天黑了，想上火照又不敢；一急，小心眼兒咕咕的吞淚了。</p>
<p>「哭，你休想　」！</p>
<p>玲玲去買了一枚暗暗地給了阿花，我想事情大概可以過去了。</p>
<p>「哦，好眼光，摸到了！屁，你欺我太太眼光花？省吃儉用，落得這般大派！誰希罕這個」。</p>
<p>針摔在地上，誰也不願再接嘴。</p>
<p>阿花，沒敢睡，給蚊子可了一夜，下一天皮膚上起着紅斑點，漸漸有了點潰爛，玲玲想替她搽紅汞，起先怕事，後來終於鼓起了勇氣。</p>
<p>「別吧，少奶奶，省得再挨太太駡，我們是苦命根，爛死也不希罕的』。不像是阿花的孩子的口吻，玲玲給她挑破了幾顆膿疱。</p>
<p>母親看見了，刻毒地瞪了阿花一眼。</p>
<p>「紅藥水？少奶奶倒怪體貼的·阿花，你命眼兒不錯呢，這瓶東西還是老爺手里留着來的，我太太也捨不得搽，輪到你，輪到你這隻賤貨」！</p>
<p>玲玲不聲不響地吃完飯校里去了，我往同學家去的個到校的日子，回來已經傍晚，客堂里沒有人，書房里沒有人，連後院里也去過，沒有人。</p>
<p>一陣哭喊聲從後樓上傅過來：</p>
<p>「少奶奶！……少爺，救救！打死了……打死了！……』</p>
<p>接着是母親的聲音：</p>
<p>「揍死你，賤貨，你，飯子可？不情願，給我滾！把米漾在河裏，餵魚？四萬洋錢一擔米、你隻賤貨只値三斗米！你…你…今天連「灶經」也不得讓我靜心靜思唸！……回話？什麽？還說是順太太碰？……』</p>
<p>我擋不住，一巴掌落在阿花的嘴巴上，唇陡地腫高了；又是一巴掌，又是一巴掌，頰上，鼻上，眼上，通串殷紅的血，掛滿了阿花的臉蛋，滴落到樓板上·</p>
<p>『都叫你們寵慣了，打？我不是沒有買過丫頭。小？十四歲還小？不見秋蘭也十四歲，洗衣服，捉茅柴，那樣不來？丫頭是打好來，緊好來的！開導？呸，狗屁，看你們個囡囡寳寳的開導，你這位好夫人還買菱給她吃，這叫做開導？」</p>
<p>又是一巴掌，又是一連串血漿，落在樓板上，泛着。……</p>
<p>半夜裏，「人的阿花」跟「狗的阿花」一樣走掉了·</p>
<p>樓板上一灘血。</p>
<p>一難奴隸的血。</p>
<p>中秋月朗朗地吻着。</p>
<h3>泰戈爾語錄</h3>
<p>— 田瑞</p>
<p>我們最謙卑的時候，便是我們最近於偉大的時候。</p>
<p>讓死者有那不朽之名，但讓生者有那不朽之愛。</p>
<p>，你在何處？夜　如一塊黑石·　在空中怒吼……怏燃起那愛情的火焰·來伴着你的生命。</p>
<h3>懷念</h3>
<p>— 益楓</p>
<p>我沒有花朶的日子裘，我想念花；在陰霾的歲月中，我渴望陽光；在寂寞的今天啊！我却懷念着那些留有我的脚印的土地。</p>
<p>淸醒的記憶吿訴我：離開山城僅僅不過四個月的日子，然而我好像是一個初離母親懷抱的小孩，對它有着無限的懷念。我懷念山城駐嚴的生活，我懷念山城自由的空氣，我更懷念山城中那些爲了爭取美麗的明天而在今天堅苦奮鬥的朋友們。從他們苦鬥的生活中，我漸漸地被開啓了智慧的門窗，我開始懂得了笑，懂得了哭，也更懂得了生活的歡愉和憂鬱。因此，我對現實有了喜愛和憎恨。</p>
<p>有時候，由於生活的鞭打，或是對現實的悲憤，我曾經討厭過山城，怨恨過山城，甚至詛咒過山城。可是在今天看起來，這都不過是一塲幼稚的頑皮罷了。一點也不是我的眞正心意，也一點不會損傷，我對它的眞摯感情，反而因爲有這樣的一種曲折，使我在今天感到對它有着更深的懷念。羅曼羅蘭說得好：「對於我們終日親近的人，我們只有在別後才能有深刻的了解」。這也許就是現在，我的心情的描繪吧！</p>
<p>在九年來流浪的生涯中，我曾經在山城度過了五個寒暑，五年前在一個黃昏的晚上，當我第一次用疲乏的脚步踏進山城的時候，山城正被淹沒在轟炸的火海中，雖然沒有燈光，但是，藉着通紅的火燄，我已淸晰地看出了一付恐怖的悲慘的用鮮血染成的圖畫：燒殘的房屋，狼藉的屍體，和那滿街揚溢的腐吳，……幾平使我疑懼是否走進了但丁的煉獄。</p>
<p>就在這樣的摧毀下，也在這樣的鞭笞下，山城始終以屹立不搖的姿態，莊嚴穆肅的神情來接受時代的考騐，担負歷史的使命。她從來沒有屈服的表示，也沒有一點苦痛的呻吟。憑着這，她挨過了苦難的歲月，迎接着勝利的黎明。</p>
<p>山城給我的啓示是偉大的堅忍的。山城給我的鍛鍊的是莊嚴的，肅穆的，而在苦難的歲月中，生活在山城的子民們也有他們的愉快和驕傲，因爲他們被孕育在自由的空氣中，有着甜美而輕快的呼吸他們敢大聲地笑，大聲地哭，在時局緊張的時候，他們呼籲，他們指責，在獲得勝利的日子，他們高歌，他們頌揚，在自由無覊的環境中，他們咄吐出胸中的愛恨，而匯集了這些自由的聲浪，「東亞燈塔」上才閃射出輝耀的亮光。……</p>
<p>五年來，我曾經認了不少的各階層的朋友，他們有的是緊守崗位的公務員，有的是枵腹從公的小學敎師，有的是勤苦功隨的大學生，…他們的環境也許不盡相同，可是他們的遭遇和理想都完全一樣，他們願意用自己的苦痛去堆砌衆人的幸福，用堅韌的努力去換來勝利的明天。</p>
<p>這些動人的情景是過去了，但回想起來，還令我有無限的激動和繫念。永遠不能忘掉。</p>
<p>初到這裏時，还因爲抱着敎徒們朝拜耶路撒冷的虔誠一樣，雖然，不時看見一些不順眼的事而惑到煩惱，可是還不曾有過怨恨和失望，但今天，我却苦痛了，我感到一陣心入骨髓的寒意。我孤獨，我寂寞，我討厭這座發霉的城市，因此，我更深深地懷念着那遙遠的山城。遠方的朋友們，你們能給我一點安慰麽？</p>
<h3>一寸山河一寸血　38</h3>
<p>— 葉勁風</p>
<p>這話怎麼說？我可不必形容她長像如何。只看她一回到家裏，長辛店一時三刻就傳開了，「梅小姐回府哪，咱們長辛店可不顯寒慚哪！」當地的母親就得對自己的女孩子說，「妣兒，你長不出好態子來，那只怪你爹你媽；再說你祖上也沒有這份德行；可你得上人家梅小姐府上去礎礎，瞧人家大小姐怎麼個仃本爲人，十成裏學到人家一成我也就不算白養了你哪！」</p>
<p>梅小姐就是這麽一個好孩子；不拿小姐身份，不學女學生那份驕傲，外帶沒一點脾氣。家裏只有一個打粗的老媽子；七口人，燒·煮，洗，刷，那兒忙得來。她母親就得花整天工夫料理家事，破的得補縫一下，大的添點新的，舊的就得改給小的，可得費點心計，翻些花樣，否則小的就着拒絕，反抗；說「待遇不公平。」對外，爸爸雖說窮，大小也是一個公務人員，面子可不能不顧到。加之他天性又愛體面，咱們孩子們就不能給他抓破面子。這一來，吳太太整天得打算佈置，忙的喘不過氣來。你想像梅小姐這們好的一個孩子，從學校裏同家，還能使小姐脾氣，拿橋裝女學生？</p>
<p>不能。她就有那們明白。一回，到家不問是寒假，暑假，節假，天不亮就起身，趕着把自己料理了，就帮着弟弟妹妹料理，排功課，溫習；舊絨繩拆下，洗，晒，繞成圈，設計織成新花樣；新料子，假使有話，先打算給誰添補；下剪刀，上熨斗，縫，紉，襯衫，旗袍，內衣，都能辦到，並且有樣子，眞不含糊。瞧着媽不開心，挖心思給她一逗就笑。有時爸爸倦了，還能親自下廚，哪怕長辛店一時買不到肥魚，大肉，什麽的，僅僅幾塊豆干，一包花生米，加上點什麼，經她一調製，就能成功那麼三兩碟可口的下酒菜。</p>
<p>「爸，您雖說這們好筋骨，年紀也不太大，可不能忙過頭，……今日您吃一杯，難得長辛店這麽好的白乾，您出錢，算我請客。」她說的那麽甜。</p>
<p>爸爸還能不接受？「芬，瞧咱們這孩子多會說話，咱們出錢，她請客。……好吧，咱們就吃她的，來，芬，你也擾她一杯。這酒、我可不願獨吞獨吃，咱們都來一口………」</p>
<p>芬是太太的學名，打從寫情書起，她就是他的「芬」。雖說也快上四十，五個孩子的母親，哪，可不見年紀，仔細一打扮，還眞像家裏的大姐姐。輪廓好，態子好，皮膚像南方人，可是北方的健康身架。</p>
<p>「眞哪，」芬笑着，「咱們這孩子天生就有這麼一張巧嘴。可話又說回來，錢是您給的，不錯，可她要買些花哪粉哪，什麽的，您還能不讓她使？這點錢不能不算她的體己？……」</p>
<p>有了這們一位大小姐，二小姐蘭君，雖說才十三歲，也不能例外。要拿她們姊妹倆品評一下，姐姐是個優等，妹妹也可能吃一個「上上，」或「上中。」要說有缺點，那就是因爲哥哥士仁有些野蠻，歡喜跟她惡作劇，拉一把小辮子，使一個絆子，等等，她沒法反抗，只大聲嚷着，「吿訴媽！」……</p>
<p>小丁香竹君，那是一個小精怪；討人喜歡，那是她的拿手。弟弟士義是全家的廣播電台，從早到晚不是唱，就是高聲學着這個說話，那個念書。要說有這麽幾分鐘不聽見他的聲音的話，您可以準備着他在搗鬼害人。</p>
<p>幾個孩子都是可愛的。要是您有這樣一個家，雖說一直在跟窮神鬧意見，剛剛弄得似乎有點起色，偏巧日本鬼子來了，大砲喧天的鬧着，您，要是您設身處地，替吳工程師想想，您打算怎麽辦？</p>
<h3>陳家燒餅</h3>
<p>— 洪爲法</p>
<p>凡是住居在揚州比較久的人，該都知道陳小四家的燒餅是很好吃的。這燒餅如蟹殼黃徽州餅等等，不論甜鹹，在戰前有時竟會賣到一毛錢一隻，可是生意却隨着昂貴的價錢更興隆起來。他的燒餅店開設在左衛街，這是揚州的金融區。那邊的銀行錢莊，每天吃點心，總會想到他家燒餅的。</p>
<p>陳小四家的燒餅雖好，可是陳小四的脾氣却很大。向他買燒餅，就回到醫院去掛號就診一樣，有先來後到，必得按照次序。你要爭先，或是催促一下，他會很不客氣的把錢退還給你：「請你到別處去買罷；」他這　直的舉動，自然不會討人喜歡，可是爲了要吃他做的燒餅，也就祇有服服貼貼隨他的便了。</p>
<p>他因爲生意興隆，掙了很多的錢，便盡心竭力的培植自己的三個兒子。並且他還有一位很賢惠而又識得幾個字的老婆。至於自己，勉强能够讀報，又能喝得幾杯酒。每天晚上，在他停止了工作以後，先是看看報，接着便很安閒的喝着酒。他常是帶着朦朧的醉眼，看看自己的賢妻佳兒，便做着美麗的好夢。他覺得自己每天做的燒餅，就同一方方的磚頭一樣，正在不斷的舖着一條平坦的大道，終會送他到幸福的境地。在他想：現時的辛苦，還能換不到將來的快樂嗎？可是三十年來，他這好夢却完全醒了。現在回想起來，這又是如何慘烈的一塲噩夢呀！</p>
<p>噩夢的經過是這樣。他的大兒子在小學裏讀完了以後，竟能託人介紹到電話局　去做練習生，又由練習生升到話務員。道是他到達幸福境地的第一座橋樑，當然很是喜歡，誰又料到這大兒子竟會患肺結核死了呢！接着他那很賢惠而又識得幾個字的老婆，又因肺結核的襲繫永遠的離開了他。這眞給與他心靈上極大的創傷。可是他這極大的創傷，隨着時間，也像漸次痊愈了。原來他的二兒子由中學畢業以後升到大學，又由大學畢業以後，做了中學敎師。這中學敎師的地位，誰都知道比他大兒子曾經做過的話務員要高得多。並且他的三兒子也居然進了大學，還能自己掙扎着到日本去硏究文學。這不是兩座使他到達幸福境地更可靠的橋樑嗎？</p>
<p>可是陳小四就更沒料到，他那在日本的三兒子又是患的肺結核，於抗戰發生的前幾年死在日本。這個噩耗，他的二兒子沒有敢告訴他，怕他再受不住這種打擊，不過却時時爲着自己憂慮，憂慮這結核菌的魔鬼也會來襲擊。接着抗戰開始，戰爭的火燄，很快的就燃燒到這揚州古城。他二兒子含着眼淚，隨着千千萬萬的人們流亡到後方。總想有一天能帶着勝利照歸來，好安慰多年辛苦的老父，然後再吿訴他早經死在日本的弟弟的噩耗。就因抗戰的時期太長了，他二兒子竟沒等到勝利的來到，憂慮變成事實，也被結核菌的魔鬼所吞噬了。這麽，就結束了陳小四美麗的好夢，顯露出一塲慘烈的噩夢了。</p>
<p>陳小四的二兒子和三兒子的死亡，到了勝利後的現在，陳小四該都已完全的淸楚了。他在抗戰前幾年，因爲二兒子已經做了中學敎師，收入足以維持家庭生活，便也不再做燒餅，把那燒餅店讓給別人去開，不過最近却又在原處做燒餅了。這和輟演已久的名角忽又下海一樣，生意依舊會興隆的。祗是他却再沒有什麽美麗的好夢了。現在在他眼前的剩了寡媳和孫女，他又能有什麼。或者說又敢有什麼希望寄託在她們身上呢！他祇爲了幸而被結核菌的魔鬼所遺棄下來的幾口，忙着維持生活的費用。他那手頭做的燒餅，像已幻化成砌造自己墓道的磚頭了。他在生活的道路上，爭鬥了幾十年，却被結核菌戰敗，幷且敗得很慘。他自己沒有想到，喜歡喫他燒餅的人們也沒想到。想來他現在做的燒餅該已有許多血淚點染在裏面，可是誰又會嘗到這異樣的滋味呢！（揚州續夢一二）</p>

<p>人不能盡其才，社會是無法談到進步兩個字的。</p>
<p>有兩位工程界老前輩，去年八月在重慶，抗戰勝利了，我看到他們都很興奮，忙這樣忙那樣，總以爲工程師們該獻身手了，不料勝利一年來，他們等於失業了一年，當局成立了一個臨時機關，不痛不癢地讓他們在做紙面工作。似乎體恤而有養老之意。</p>
<p>還有一批派往美國實習的工程師，最近回了國，其中有四十幾人，在上海躭擱下來，他們不是在做寓公，因爲他們過去大都是公務員，沒有發財，而是住在公寓裏等事做。這般人，美國的工廠曾經留過他們，他們並朱貪岡美國的生活，祖國培植他們，他們堅決地回來，準備爲祖國服務的。</p>
<p>照普通人情看來，這些專家應該「飢不擇食」了，但是，我知道他們在上海，旣未被洋商誘惑，又不轉什麼買賣的念頭，更毫無消極表示。他們每天在搜集各地的工程方面的資料，計劃這條路，計劃那個港，這情景或爲若干人們認爲是書　子，但屬他們是書　子的人却不得不承認這般人給與社會的影響和他們的分量。</p>
<p>好人是經得起錘鍊的，社會更不是瞎眼者，我們爲這般人的行逕所感動，敬佩他們，更希望政府別使他們閒散太久。</p>
<h3>誰的香港</h3>
<p>— 錦霞</p>
<p>本月十四日，香港政府發言人發表談話，否認九龍城內仍爲中國領土。（按一八九八年的「北京條約」中載有：「現在九龍城內駐指紥之中國官員，仍可在城內各司其事。」不知道是這位發言人善忘，還是條文另有解釋？</p>
<p>上海市參議會在本月十六日大會巾，一致通過決議：請我政府交涉收回港九，澳門。</p>
<p>其實遠在今年二月七日，廣東省參議會駐會委員會，早有同樣的決議案，並且已經電請政府向英人交涉，不過還聽不到下文？</p>
<p>英國自由黨領袖斯脫拉巴爾基爵士，去年十二月十九日，在倫敦宣稱：英國應迅速「寬大」地將香港歸還原主，以換取廣大的中國之永久友誼，而使英國在亞洲的道德地位與威望提高。</p>
<p>可見此人的目光和見識比我們的參議員還敏銳，可惜的是：英國人之中，頭腦淸醒如斯脫拉爵士的，畢竟不多。</p>
<p>我國勝利後，英人在九龍屛山附近建築飛機塲，二十村，數十戶，一萬畝田，二萬餘鄕民，夷爲平地，無家可歸。經我國政府提出抗議，不知目前眞實情况如何？</p>
<p>在國際間的意義上，港九問題的重要性至少和東北相等！</p>
<p>把視綫移到香港，我們可以看到——</p>
<p>香港人口百餘萬，華人佔百分之九十二。據衛生局估計香港的老鼠和人口數字相等。</p>
<p>烟（常然是鴉片），酒，賽馬，舞塲，買淫，其他的娛樊塲所，無一不備，單以富翁的淫樂消費，每年常在港幣一千萬元以上。</p>
<p>香港的酒稅，烟稅，博彩稅（包括賽馬和其他賭博），娛樂稅佔香港政府歲收預算的鉅大數字。</p>
<p>本年七八月間—由我國遷居香港的鉅商有百餘人，逃入香港的資金達港幣一百萬萬，繁榮了香港，削减了我國的經濟。</p>
<p>香港是高等華人的樂園。</p>
<p>也有人說：它是建築在地獄上的天堂。</p>
<p>我以爲它正是插在我國脈管上的一枚抽血針！</p>
<h3>紹興戲與殺夫</h3>
<p>— 痴墨</p>
<p>殺害親夫的詹周氏，此番已判了死刑，她聞判時竟亦會混身發抖。</p>
<p>有一位記者問她，「你哪能曉得把屍體可以放在箱子裏？」</p>
<p>她很快的回答道「迪個是從紹興戲（越劇）裏看來的。」</p>
<p>是的，她不是說的假話，紹興戲的女人把男屍扔入箱子中的戲有好幾齣，時常可以看到的有「借紅燈」，借紅燈巾的「林逢春」之屍體，也是藏在箱子中的，還有「玉蜻蜓」中之「申貴升」，還有不少齣，這裏不用一一介紹。</p>
<p>而且紹興戲裏的把死人扔在箱子中的女人，到後來都是一品夫人，吃官司的一個也沒有。</p>
<p>此番詹周氏不但吃官司，而且還要槍斃或絞刑，豈不是紹典戲害了她。</p>
<p>科學常識</p>
<h3>談燙髪</h3>
<p>— 加另</p>
<p>美國的科學進步一日千里，化粧品工　也是日新月異。娘娘兒們的「奶油電燙」可以用「冷燙」來代替了。這種「冷燙」，旣不需要電流，也不必有燙機。在任何地方，任何時間，都可舉行，眞是簡單，便利而安全。</p>
<p>妳可以不必趕到理髮店或美容室去，就在妳的府上，祇須購買二種曲髮藥水，就可開始「冷燙」了。先把妳的頭髮仔細洗淸，除淨頭脂和油汚。然後使用第一種藥水，即可使頭髮日動皺曲起來，隨心所欲地做成任何形式。然後用第二種藥水來固定它。美觀而新奇的曲髪就產生了。最後妳把剩餘的藥水洗去，「冷燙』己經吿成了。這種曲髮藥水早有多家化粧品公司出品了，恐怕是限於海關禁令，還沒有推銷到我國來。我們當然也不希望它光臨！</p>
<p>說穿了，這戲法也沒有什麽神秘，不過是一種化學和物理變化而己。第一種藥水含有Aminonium　Thioglycollate，第二種藥水不過是酸化的雙氧水而己。</p>
<p>原來我們頭髮的蛋白質中有百分之十五是Cystine，唸過化學的人都知道Cystine的分子是由二個氨基酸被二個硫黃原子所連繫而成。這不斷交錯的Cystine鏈，使頭髮呈現了特有的形狀和性質。假使把Cystine的-S-S-　切斷，那末頭髮就可改變成任何的曲度和形狀，不再堅持它的原形了。曲髪的第一種藥水中的Ammonium　Thioglycollate可以使-S-S-還原到二個-SH的Cysteine。而酸化的雙　水使改變了排列地位的Cysteine再重新結合成Cystine。於是曲綿構成了。穩固而持久，恰如天生的一般。</p>

<h3>統計</h3>
<p>— 新方</p>
<p>小學六年，以今日上海小學最低的學費計，十二學期是一百二十萬元。</p>
<p>中學六年，每學期以十五萬計，十二學期是一百八十萬元。</p>
<p>大學四年，每學期最低以二十萬元計，入學期是一百六十萬元。</p>
<p>一個讀了十六年書的大學畢業生，他十六年來的學費是四百六十萬元，如果以最低拆息一角計，四百六十萬元每月該是四十六萬元，但是請問現在一個初出學校的大學畢業生，是否能够在社會上找到一只每月有四十六萬收入的「飯碗」？</p>
<p>時事雜感</p>
<h3>周佛海來了　請看壓軸戲</h3>
<p>— 雨人</p>
<p>且聽他如何自白！</p>
<p>陳公博槍決了，褚民誼槍決了，梅思平槍決了……幾個巨奸差不多判的判了，死的死了，於是大家更想起那幾個遠在重慶的「周公佛海」，「羅大靑天」等人來。一向沒有他們的消息，前不多時報上還說他們在重慶坐吉普卡，逛舞塲，「風姿不减當年」，更使人如墮五里霧中。</p>
<p>但是，別忙！你看過平劇嗎？開頭的總是些無足輕重的戲，名角兒自然非到最後上塲不可；現在，所有巨奸都已解決了事，正是挨着這幾個「碩果僅存」的「漢奸泰斗」上塲的時候了。於是，一架飛機，便把他們送到了南京寗海路看押所去了。</p>
<p>五名巨奸的名字中：周佛海，丁默邨，羅君强三人自然名氣「響亮」，無庸介紹；還有兩個！馬驥良和楊愀華，都是周逆的下屬。此次五人坐機「還都」，携有行李數百件，金條金元寳無數，並有隨員僮僕多名，「部長」派頭，畢竟非同小可！</p>
<p>大家都注視着這幕壓軸戲的上塲，預料一定有精彩演出。法庭上他們也許會侃侃而談：自己怎樣愛國，怎樣「忍辱負重」，怎樣「掩護地下工作」，而且他們還在勝利前幾天「自首」過了呢！但是，歪理十八條，而世界上的公理只有一個：「叛國者死」！大家拭目以待：等一天他們被押上刑塲的時侯，讓他們去「往矣」「往矣」吧！</p>

<h3>新聞界前輩　邵力子先生</h3>
<p>— 幼南</p>
<p>黨國名流當中。生平軼事趣聞最多的，第一要推邵力子先生。邵先生是遜淸舉人，當過敎師，曾任報社編輯，又係被開除黨籍的共產黨員，私人秘書，省府主席，外交大使，宣傳部長，大學校長，陸軍少將…………職銜經歷，用六號鉛字，也可以印滿一張卡片。</p>
<p>風吹柳梳頭</p>
<p>爲了恐防遺　，所以將邵先生過去的軼事，從頭說起：邵先生本名聞泰，字仲輝，力子不過是他的筆名，浙江紹興人，自幼聰明好學，有「神童」，「小曹植」的綽號；十二歲時、父執到訪，向他打趣道：「你旣有神童之名，讓我出一聯給你對，如果答得好，有十塊錢贈給你買東西吃。」他說出「雨滴花洗面」的上聯，邵隨口應道：「風吹柳梳頭」。父執大爲驚嘆，立刻獎賞十金·十四歲入庠爲秀才，十六歲中舉。</p>
<p>淸末，于右任在長安創辦師範學校，邵氏被聘爲敎授。民國元年，入民立報爲編輯，其後迭任民國日報，生活日報，覺悟報編輯；那時的民國日報，經費枯窘，節縮至無一可緊縮，連外埠專電也無力應付，但是堂堂大報，豈可獨無專電，邵氏情急智生，每夕必到新申報（筆者按：並非敵僞時代的「新申報」。）訪晤好友孫東吳主筆，相對談笑，態度閒暇，其實當孫氏批閱專電時，邵氏冷眼旁觀，一一默記在心，吿辭回館，立即伏案揮毫，改頭換面，照樣發排各地專電·居然織毫不漏，邵氏的記才急智。可以概見。</p>
<p>濃裝老太婆</p>
<p>邵氏與故中委葉楚傖，同宿民國日報社，當時社址在老楊慶和銀樓隔隣，無事時候，兩人常侍窗眺望銀樓出入的女顧客，葉氏曾吟打油詩道：「結得芳隣楊慶和，朝朝暮暮看嬌娥，邵氏代續說道：「有時辜負伸頭頸，碰着濃裝老太婆。」邵氏早歲的幽默多才，原是文士本性，不足爲怪！</p>
<p>未幾，邵氏加人共產黨，被選爲中央委員，十五年被開除黨籍，邵氏也同時登報脫離共黨，適蔣主席慕其大才，聘爲秘書，尊敬如待良師益友·邵氏在報社時期，鼓吹革命，却未受牢獄之災，不料十四年，任黃埔軍校少將政治部主任時·却嘗了一夜鐵窗風味；邵氏華委初到黃埔，適値蔣校長出發二次東征·邵氏偕衛隊趕往謁晤，行至東莞，因衛隊槍械執照，號碼不符，邵氏首次南下，寂寂無名，因此被憲兵拘留一夜。次日始由校方保釋，</p>
<p>曾經到蘇聯</p>
<p>二十一年，邵氏任甘蕭省政府主席，二十五年任陜西省政府主席，二十九年，任駐蘇大使。邵氏在十四年及十七年曾二次赴蘇聯考察，十九年邵氏在首都舉行婚禮，夫人傳學文女士，即爲邵氏在蘇遊歷時相識。使蘇之前，邵氏曾任中央宣傳部長，這是他的老本行，當然勝任出色。</p>
<p>邵氏有藏書的愛好，所存多爲黨史考古等典篇。據說他有扦脚的習慣，每日必須扦脚，眞可謂雅人多推事。不知是否患的「香港脚」？</p>
<p>邵氏已届六十三歲，但勝利以後，一直爲着奔走團結面忙，眞是一位可敬的老人！</p>

<h3>The National Army Advances Rapidly in the Ping-Sui Line, Recovering Fengzhen and Liangcheng Successively; The Communist Army in Zhangjiakou Carries Out Destruction Work</h3>
<p>[Urgent Telegram from Gui Sui, Central News Agency, 19th] The National Army recovered Fengzhen and the old site of Liangcheng County (the old site of Liangcheng County) on the Ping-Sui Line in the afternoon of the 19th. Only Xinghe County in eastern Sui has not yet been recovered. (Note: Fengzhen is located about 70 li north of Datong)</p>
<p>[Report from our newspaper in Beiping, 19th] Another National Army force advancing south in eastern Sui recovered Liangcheng at 1:00 AM on the 18th. As of now, only Xinghe County in eastern Sui has not yet been recovered.</p>
<p>[Report from our newspaper in Gui Sui, 19th] The vanguard cavalry of the National Army in eastern Sui has now reached the vicinity of Longshengzhuang. After recovering Liangcheng in southern Sui yesterday, the National Army has cut off the support for the Communist Army in northern Yan in the Dahai Po Basin and can pass through the plains, approaching Fengzhen. Northern Yan refugees returning from Suiyuan are currently active in the Youyu Nanshan area, posing a major threat to the rear of the Communist Army in southern Sui. Since the Hequ security forces moved into the county seat and Yangguan Laoying, the Communist militia who defected in the northwestern Shanxi separatist area have also emerged like a rising wind in eastern Sui. Near Pinglu County, there are National Army soldiers who were scattered near Datong, led by An Dangguo, attacking the road between Yan'an and Zhangjiakou.</p>
<p>[Telegram from Gui Sui, Central News Agency, 19th] Gongguiying Guyingpan and other places two kilometers southeast of Jining were occupied by the Communist Army's 11th Brigade and Training Brigade under Nie Rongzhen. On the 15th, they were all defeated by the National Army, and the above strongholds were firmly recovered.</p>
<p>[Report from our newspaper in Tianjin, 19th] It is reported that in the Jining battle, the Communist Army has lost half of its entire force in eastern Sui, southern Chahar, and northern Shanxi, which is obviously a destructive blow.</p>
<p>[Report from our newspaper in Gui Sui, 19th] The 600-strong Wulejiao Suer troops of the puppet Mongolian army on the border of Chahar and Sui harassed our Wuchuan rear when the National Army recovered Jining. They were repelled by the defending troops and the Fourth Prince Banner security forces. After the recovery of Jining, the puppet army fled to Sonid Right Banner.</p>
<p>[Report from our newspaper in Beiping, 19th] It is now confirmed that Zhangjiakou has presented the state of the Communist Army before withdrawing from Chengde. The airfield was destroyed the day before yesterday. The weekly liaison plane of the Military Mediation Department failed to fly out today. The power plant has also been destroyed. All important materials and machines have been completely moved. Fortifications have been built throughout the city and outside. The radio station of the government representative of the Zhangjiakou Group of the Military Mediation Department was ordered by the Communist side to be dismantled yesterday, and the actions of the government and American members were monitored. The government has protested to the Communist side, and the American side is particularly concerned about the safety of the group. Therefore, they have proposed to the government that the group be withdrawn, saying that the plane can no longer land in Zhangjiakou, then the Communist side will send the group members to the National Army defense area on the border of Hebei and Chahar, but the Communist side has not yet expressed its position.</p>
<p>[Report from our newspaper in Beiping, 19th] Today, the reporter visited the military relations authorities to inquire about the combat strength of the Communist Army and the Zhangjiakou issue. It is said that, as evidenced by the speed of the National Army's recovery of the twelve counties in eastern Hebei, and the successive capture of Zhuozishan and Jining in eastern Sui, forcing Fengzhen, and the Communist Army's siege of Datong with 80,000 troops against the defending army of less than 10,000 people, but has not yet captured it, the strength of the Communist Army can be seen. The huge losses suffered by the Communist Army in the mutual encirclement battle of Jining were the heaviest since the Siping Street battle, and its impact on the future operations of the Communist Army is similar to the Siping Street battle. Therefore, Fengzhen is like Changchun, and the National Army will follow it when it arrives. Observing the various performances of the Communist Army in Zhangjiakou, it is not easy to say whether it will abandon Zhangjiakou, but if the government wants to recover Zhangjiakou, even if it fights the National Army with the same force as attacking Datong, it will be of no avail, and it is even doubtful whether it can maintain it for a week. It is also learned that, in addition to the Communist Army in Datong, the Communist Army in Zhangjiakou and its periphery is 50,000. When the battle in eastern Hebei ended, about 10,000 people from Li Yunchang's troops went west to the south of Miyun on the Pinggu Line, where they were intercepted by a regiment of the National Army and suffered more than 1,000 casualties.</p>
<p>[Report from our newspaper in Beiping, 19th] Relevant parties learned that the border between Hebei and Chahar is becoming increasingly tense. The National and Communist armies have each increased their forces to two armies. The border between the two armies has prohibited travelers from passing through. Yesterday, a teacher who went to Zhangjiakou turned back when he reached the border.</p>
<p>[Telegram from Gui Sui, Central News Agency, 19th] The eastern section of the Ping-Sui Railway has been completed after the railway bureau was assisted by troops along the way to rush to repair it. On the 18th, it was opened from Gui Sui to Zhuozishan, and on the 19th at 3:00 PM, a train was reopened eastward, directly to Jining.</p>
<p>[Report from Agence France-Presse in Beiping, 19th] According to reports here, the government army is expected to capture Zhangjiakou within ten days.</p>
<h3>Chief Chen Flies to Gui Sui, Will Transfer to Taiyuan to Meet Commander Yan</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper in Beiping, 19th] Chief Chen Cheng left Beiping at 9:07 this morning and flew to Gui Sui. Chief Sun Lianzhong and other leaders went to the airport to see him off. Before his departure, Chen purchased several boxes of antiques and daily necessities in Ping as gifts, intending to give them to Commander Fu Zuoyi and other senior generals in Suiyuan to show his condolences. After Chen inspects Gui Sui, he will transfer to Taiyuan to meet Commander Yan Xishan if necessary, and then return to Nanjing. Chen gave a lecture at the headquarters of the Eleventh War Zone last night, recounting that political consultation and Marshal Ma's mediation both failed due to the Communist Party's lack of sincerity. He then explained the government's determination and the understanding that active-duty generals should have, saying: If the Communist Army does not lift the siege of Datong, the use of force is inevitable, and the battle must be won. Finally, he recalled his combat experience.</p>
<h3>The Communist Army in the Suburbs of Datong Collapsed and Fled to Yanggao Overnight</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper in Beiping, 19th] It is reported that the Communist Party of the Military Mediation Department once expressed to the government that it was willing to lift the siege of Datong, but the government said that since the National Army in eastern Sui had already begun to act, it was too late to talk about lifting the siege, and lifting the siege was not limited to the city of Datong alone, all three county towns in northern Shanxi occupied by the Communist Army must be withdrawn. This issue was shelved.</p>
<p>[Telegram from Datong, Central News Agency, 19th] The Communist Army's dream of attacking the city outside Datong has obviously been completely shattered recently. Since the 16th, there has been a symbol of retreat. On the 16th, the National Army recovered the Police School in the west of the city, the Wulidian Majunying, Songjiadian, and the airfield in the south of the city, Shuiquanwan, Beiyue Temple, and Zhoujiadian one after another, and counterattacked Caojiabao, Shaling, Caifulou, Qiyipo and other places. On the 17th, the National Army in the north of the city recovered important strongholds such as Beiguan and the railway station, and the Communist Army there fled to Qilibao and Huwan.</p>
<p>[Telegram from Taiyuan, Central News Agency, 19th] On the 16th and 17th, the Communist Army in the suburbs of Datong retreated to Julebao successively through Ershilipu and Sanshilipu in the east of the city, reaching tens of thousands of people. A unit of more than 3,000 people passed through Shancheng Nan Qilicun, Shaling, and other areas in the east of the city on the 16th, requisitioning more than 100 carts and fleeing to Yanggao overnight.</p>
<h3>The Battle in Southwestern Baoding Enters the Final Stage</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper in Tianjin, 19th] The battle in southwestern Baoding has also entered the final stage. The Communist Army's 6th Field Brigade with more than 7,000 troops and more than 10,000 militia, after being hit head-on by Liu Huanan's division and attacked from both sides by the National Army on the Shunqiao side of the Pinghan Railway, were annihilated by more than half and retreated to Zhangdengzhen. Currently, there are no battles within 40 li around Baoding. The military and political authorities are comforting the people and rushing to clean up the countryside.</p>
<p>[Report from our newspaper in Beiping, 19th] The materials in Gaoyang City, Baoding Telephone, have been completely moved away by the Communist Army, and at the same time, a large army has been assembled in an attempt to fight the National Army in the area. The National Army advancing towards Anguo County has reached 20 li from the county seat.</p>
<p>[Telegram from Central News Agency in Baoding, 19th] The Communist Army that has been attacking Dawei Village, 25 kilometers southwest of Baoding, and the 13th Brigade Cavalry Regiment and other units of the Communist Army newly transferred from Shandong to the south bank of the Tang River in Baoding, fearing encirclement by the National Army, urgently retreated to Dongfu. A unit of the National Army has successfully entered Anguo County (east of the Pinghan Railway, south of Baoding).</p>
<h3>Battle Results of Recovering Jining</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper in Jinan, 18th] After the recovery of Jining, efforts are being made to restore traffic between Jining and Jizhou. Local administrative work has been launched. According to Wu Huawen's telegram, the battle results of the Jining campaign are: (1) The National Army injured one battalion commander, four company commanders, five platoon leaders, and 123 soldiers, and two platoon leaders and 47 soldiers were killed in action. (2) The Communist Army injured more than 300 people, left 483 corpses, and 53 people were captured.

<h3>The Communist Army in North China Suffers Losses and Actively Destroys Transportation</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper in Beiping, 19th] According to traffic sources, after the continuous defeats of the Communist Army in North China, it will once again actively destroy transportation to contain the rapid movement of the National Army. According to reports from the Jinpu, Pinghan, Jiaoji, Pinggu, and Pingsui lines in the past two days, it is proved that the Communist Army on each line is generally preparing road excavation tools and laborers, and at the same time, avoiding the heavy and moving to sections with slightly sparse defenses. Machang Tangguantun in the northern section of the Jinpu Road was attacked by the Communist Army last night, but the authorities have made a decision on this, increasing the strength of troops along the line and thoroughly clearing it up.</p>
<h3>Fang Yingfu, Commander of the Communist Army in Northern Hubei, Speedily Repents and Surrenders</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper in Hankou, 18th] Military news: Fang Yingfu, commander of the Communist Army in the three counties of Huang'an Jing Fu Macheng, has surrendered to our government in Xuanhuadian with weapons.</p>
<p>[Telegram from Taiyuan, Central News Agency, 19th] Bei Sha, commander of the Communist Army's 78th Regiment, led more than 600 troops, carrying more than ten light and heavy machine guns and one mortar, and surrendered to the National Army.</p>
<p>[Telegram from Qingdao, Central News Agency, 19th] The entire Jiaoxian Independent Battalion of the Communist Army recently surrendered to the garrisoned National Army with weapons.</p>
<h3>Huaiyin City Was Completely Recovered Yesterday Afternoon; The Main Force of the Communist Army Collapsed Completely; Remnants Fled Towards the Northeast</h3>
<p>[Telegram from Xuzhou, Central News Agency, 19th] At 2:30 PM today, the National Army completely recovered Huaiyin. The Communist Army there collapsed completely and fled in the northeast direction. Huaiyin is the main base of the Communist Army in northern Jiangsu. In order to ensure the occupied area of northern Jiangsu and further threaten Beijing and Shanghai, the Communist Army specially transferred Xu Xiangqian to lead his troops from Shandong to reinforce the defense of northern Jiangsu, sitting in Huaiyin and planning military affairs. In total, there were six divisions of the Communist Army there, holding dangerous positions. In order to eliminate the threat to Beijing and Shanghai, the National Army advanced towards Huaiyin after recovering Siyang, to urge them to wake up as soon as possible and abandon their attempt to use Huaiyin as a base to harass central Jiangsu. On the afternoon of the 17th, they broke into the city. After two days and nights of fierce fighting, they joined forces with the National Army outside the city and finally completely recovered it on the afternoon of the 19th. After this defeat, the Communist Army's morale was greatly reduced. At present, a small number of villages and towns outside the city still have resistance.</p>
<p>[Telegram from Jiangdu, Central News Agency, 19th] The main force of the Huaiyin Communist Army has been defeated by the National Army. This morning, a large number of National Army troops poured in from the south gate, meeting the National Army troops who poured in from the west gate, and attacked them from both sides. By 10:00 AM, the Communist Army had fled from the east gate in a panic. By 2:00 PM, order in the city had gradually been restored.</p>
<p>[Report from our newspaper in Zhenjiang, 19th] According to Yangzhou Telephone: The National Army northwest (ten li) of Huaiyin recovered Yugouzhen on the afternoon of the 19th, but it has not yet been confirmed by the military. Also, in the area of Jiaoling Da Dongzhen (seven li from Lianshui city) and Xiaoguji southeast of Lianshui, our National Army is engaged in fierce fighting with the Communist Army. It is also learned that the National Army in Taixian recovered Qutang on the 18th.</p>

<h3>Zheng's Pacification Director; Liu Zhi Dismissed</h3>
<p>Three Section Chiefs Have Been Detained</p>
<p>[Report from our newspaper in Beiping, 19th] Chen Cheng said here yesterday during a speech: Liu Zhi, director of the Zhengzhou Pacification Headquarters, has been dismissed.

<h3>Hebei Provincial Government Formulates Measures to Reorganize Land in Recovered Areas; Land Administration Council to Be Established in Short Term</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper in Beiping, 19th] Baoding Telephone: (1) In order to adapt to the environment of the newly recovered Communist area and reduce land disputes, the Hebei Provincial Government has stipulated temporary measures as follows: (A) Land "cleared" by the Communist Party will be restored to the ownership of the original landlord, but the right to use it will still temporarily belong to the current cultivator. (B) For land sold under duress, the original landlord shall submit documents, the administrative authorities shall assess the price, and the original landlord shall be responsible for recovering the ownership, while the right to use it shall still temporarily belong to the current cultivator. (C) For land sold under duress by self-cultivating farmers, the ownership can be recovered according to the documents, and the right to use it can be recovered as soon as possible. The price shall be assessed by the official. Those who lose their land due to the original owner's recovery shall be allocated the right to use the land by the official. (D) It is stipulated that the maximum and minimum price limits for the use of land by each self-cultivating farmer and the land owned by the landlord. (E) When the official stipulates the land rent standard, it should not exceed 37.5% of the total harvest. (2) In order to solve the land problem, the Hebei Provincial Government has decided to establish a land administration council in the near future to reorganize land records, land registration, and land rights.</p>

<h3>The United States Has Never Considered Freezing Wartime Surplus Materials Transported to China; Agreement Recently Signed to Implement Quickly</h3>
<p>[Joint News Agency, Washington, 18th] According to sources in authority here, the United States has no intention of freezing wartime surplus materials transported to China recently. Officials also said that no such action has ever been considered. Related sources further pointed out that any terms of the recent US$800 million transaction with China will not have any impact on curbing China's civil war, as reported in Nanjing. Authorities also said that the first thing to explain is that the shipment of this large amount of materials from the battlefields of China and seventeen islands in the Pacific to China is a long-term task, and only a small portion may be completed in one or two years. The source then pointed out that the United States will ship materials as soon as possible in the recently signed agreement, and the US officials who handle this matter are all enthusiastic, because this transfer of surplus materials is also to offset the account with China. During the war, China built airfields for the US military and supplied the US military with supplies. This transfer of materials can offset the equivalent of US$120 million of the amount the United States owes China.</p>

Since Huangqiao was reoccupied by the Communist Army, it has carried out a large-scale massacre of intellectuals. He Zhuofu, the teaching director of Huangqiao Middle School, and others were killed.</p>

<h3>Ye Jianying Breaches Agreement; Robertson Indignant</h3>
<p>[Telegram from Central News Agency in Beiping, 19th] According to recent information, the three-party representatives of the Military Mediation Department, at Kewen's request on the first of this month, answered questions with Kewen in order to clarify the ideals of mediation, so that Kewen could use them for broadcasting after returning to the United States, and it was agreed that each question and answer must be approved by the three committee members in advance, and no temporary changes should be made. Unexpectedly, when the government representative Zheng Jiemin and the American committee member Robertson broadcast according to the words passed by the three parties, when it was the turn of the CCP committee member Ye Jianying to broadcast, Ye suddenly violated the previous agreement and attacked the government and the United States in his speech, and the language was extremely absurd. Zheng Jiemin immediately proposed to stop it. Robertson was particularly indignant at Ye's breach of trust and promise, and stated that the broadcast should be sent to Yan'an and a copy should be sent to Marshal Marshall. Kewen also guaranteed on the spot that the broadcast would never be broadcast in the United States. Ye Jianying looked very embarrassed when he heard this.</p>

<h3>Next Year's Financial Policy: Increasing Revenue Will Be More Important Than Reducing Expenditure; The General Budget Will Be Delayed Until November</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper in Nanjing, 19th] It is learned that due to objective circumstances, reducing expenditure will be more important than increasing revenue in next year's financial policy. For the revenue part of next year, the financial authorities hope to increase revenue through increased collection of inheritance tax, comprehensive income tax, etc., to enrich the national treasury, but the prospects are not good due to restrictions of various technical conditions. In addition, income from the sale of enemy and puppet industries and state-run enterprises cannot be expected too optimistically. Therefore, central agencies will inevitably reduce staff and streamline administration. In terms of local finance, county-level finance can be improved after the reform, while provincial finance remains difficult, so austerity is also necessary. Relevant people expressed that, based on the speed at which various agencies are preparing budgets, the general budget for next year may be delayed until November.</p>
<h3>Petrov Visits the Envoy; Special Envoy Marshall Receives Yu Dawei; and Hopes That the Communist Party Will Participate in the Five-Person Talks</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper in Nanjing, 19th] Ambassador Stuart visited Jinling University with Fu Jingbo at 4:00 PM on the 19th and returned to the embassy at 5:00 PM. Later, Soviet Ambassador Petrov visited the envoy and talked for a long time.</p>

He came out at 11:45. According to the ambassador's answer to reporters, Special Envoy Marshall is still waiting for the Communist Party to participate in the informal five-person group meeting. He also said: He is deeply saddened by the fierce fighting in various parts of China, so he hopes that the Communist Party can quickly participate in the five-person meeting. When the reporter asked whether the content of the report on the talks of the Philippine formal five-person group meeting had been expanded, he replied: This has not been considered yet. When the reporter asked whether the distance between the opinions of the Communist Party and the government was very far, whether the ambassador and Special Envoy Marshall intended to have new compromise opinions, he replied: The primary task at present is still to convene the five-person meeting to solve the problem of the distribution of the National Government committee member quota, and then talk about other things after there are achievements. Also, the ambassador's private consultant, Chuan Jingbo, visited Wang Bingnan of the Communist Party delegation at 11:20 AM on the 19th and came out at 12:00. According to the spokesman of the Communist Party, Chuan came here today to convey the government's formal rejection of the idea of participating in the military three-person meeting.</p>
<p>[United News Agency Report from This City] Zhou Enlai, the representative of the CCP, met with reporters from the United News Agency at his residence in Shanghai yesterday. It is said that: I have temporarily withdrawn from the Nanjing political negotiations and will no longer conduct "meaningless" consultations with the government and American representatives. This consultation is almost to cover up the situation of the Chinese civil war, so that the people of China and the United States cannot know the truth. Unless the chairman agrees to reopen the military three-person meeting, I will not return to Nanjing.</p>

<h3>Zhou Fohai's Confession - Cultural Traitor Zhou Zuoren's Public Trial Postponed</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch from Nanjing, 19th] The transfer of the five major traitors, including Zhou Fohai, is expected to occur in a few days. They are living comfortably in their quarters, with their daily needs and affairs being taken care of by the staff. The four individuals they brought along—a caretaker, maid, adjutant, and cook—have been allowed to enter and leave separately over the past two days. Their daily breakfast consists of pastries at their own expense, while lunch and dinner include five dishes and a soup, with both fish and meat. Recently, Zhou Zuoren has been drafting his confession, reportedly amounting to over ten pages.</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch from Nanjing, 19th] The Capital High Court originally scheduled the public trial of the major cultural traitor Zhou Zuoren for the morning of the 19th. However, due to incomplete evidence investigation, no debate was held. Instead, the court only questioned Zhou Zuoren for an hour regarding the results of the investigation into the evidence he submitted. At 10:30 AM, Presiding Judge Ge Zhiqin and Judges Ge Zhaotang, Yang Yutian, and Prosecutor Wang Wenjun convened a collegiate panel at the Dacheng Hall. Zhou Zuoren, accompanied by lawyer Wang Long, appeared in court wearing a blue-gray cloth long gown, black casual shoes, and yellow-rimmed glasses. He appeared calm, although his temples were gray and his expression seemed aged. Presiding Judge Ge routinely inquired about his name, age, and origin before commencing the sequential review of the evidence investigation results. Many of these were favorable to Zhou Zuoren, particularly the letters from former Peking University President Jiang Menglin and President Hu Shih, confirming that they had instructed him and three other professors to preserve the university's property, ensuring no losses and even a slight increase upon the victory of the resistance, which was most advantageous. A letter from Yuan Tongli, Director of the Peking Library, attested that no books were lost during Zhou Zuoren's tenure as director. Regarding the rescue of Ying Qianli and Dong Xifan, the former had already left Northwest University, and the latter was in Shanghai on official business, with the investigation incomplete. Zhou Zuoren considered this unimportant, impatient to wait any longer, and requested an immediate public trial and sentencing. The court ruled that a thorough investigation should be conducted, and the hearing was adjourned until Dong Xifan's letter from Shanghai was received in Beijing and Ying Qianli returned. The defendant was then returned to the Tiger Bridge prison.</p>
<h3>Zhou Longxiang and Xu Fengxiang Both Sentenced to Life Imprisonment</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 19th] The Capital High Court announced the sentences for a batch of traitors this afternoon.

Qian Sen was sentenced to three years' imprisonment. Each was deprived of their civil rights for the duration of their sentences, and their property was confiscated, except for a portion reserved for the necessary living expenses of their families.</p>
<h3>Zhang Beisheng's Death Sentence is Currently Under Review</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch from Suzhou, 19th] Zhang Beisheng, the former Minister of Civil Affairs of the puppet Jiangsu Province and Commissioner of the Northern Jiangsu Clearance, was previously sentenced to death by the Jiangsu High Court after a retrial. His case is currently under review by the Supreme Court. Today, the High Court specifically ordered Zhang Beisheng to be transferred from the detention center to the Third Prison. Local circles generally anticipate that his execution may not be far off.</p>
<h3>Zhang Yanqing Released</h3>
<p>Based on Evidence of Underground Work</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Beiping, 19th] Zhang Yanqing, former Vice President of the puppet Xinmin Association, was arrested for treason. After multiple interrogations by the Hebei High Prosecutor's Office, he was released with a decision not to prosecute. According to reliable sources, there is evidence that Zhang engaged in underground work, which was confirmed after repeated investigations, hence the decision not to prosecute.</p>
<h3>US Military Tribunal Established in China with Our Consent</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch from Nanjing, 19th] An official from the Judicial Yuan stated: The establishment of a US military tribunal in China to try German war criminals was done with our full consent. The government issued a decree regarding this matter last winter. As the Judicial Yuan is part of the National Government, there is no need for further expression. The recent trial of German war criminals in Shanghai by the US military tribunal, where the defendant's lawyer boldly claimed it was "illegal," is without foundation.</p>
<h3>US Aircraft Crash Story Turns Out to Be a Hoax</h3>
<p>The Supposed Pilot Has Fled</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch from Suzhou, 19th] The recent reports in Suzhou, Wuxi, and Shanghai newspapers about the crash of a US aircraft in Wangting have now been confirmed to be a complete fabrication. Chen Jianshuo, who claimed to be a lieutenant pilot, attempted to borrow money from the Wuxi County Government but failed. He has since disappeared from a hotel in Wuxi.</p>
<h3>Kunming High Court President Accused - Lu Shizeng Publishes Announcement</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch from Kunming, 18th] Following the accusation against High Court President Lu Shizeng by Zhejiang merchant Lu Shousheng, the local People's Freedom Protection Committee and public opinion organizations have expressed unanimous support. Recently, Lu published an announcement in the newspapers, stating in essence: "I am lacking in virtue and inferior in learning, and I am ashamed to be the head of the High Court, often feeling overwhelmed. I have repeatedly requested to resign due to the heavy responsibilities, but my request has not been granted. The recent reports are all based on one-sided accounts," and so on. The Yunnan Supervisory Office has expressed great concern, and the senators also stated that this is the first step towards eradicating the darkness within the judiciary.</p>
<h3>Investigating Military Traitors - Ministry of National Defense Announces Implementation Measures for Regulations</h3>

(7) In cases of confiscation of property for treasonous crimes, a property inventory shall be prepared for each case, and the confiscated items shall be submitted to the national treasury monthly. Those who dispose of the property without approval shall be punished for embezzlement, with severe punishment for the principal officer and the responsible personnel.</p>
<h3>Heavenly Rain Falls, Osmanthus Blooms - The People of Hongdu Eagerly Await the Chairman's Arrival</h3>
<p>— Our Special Correspondent, Fang Cangcang</p>
<p>Sights and Sounds of Nanchang, Part Two</p>
<p>The suburbs of Nanchang, the largest basin on the eastern bank of the Gan River, receive only about 1,200 millimeters of rainfall annually. The summers are extremely hot. This autumn, there have been southerly winds and light rain, making the scorching heat unbearable. Recently, there have been two showers over three days, diminishing the intense heat. With the heavenly rain, the osmanthus trees will bloom. (There are five osmanthus trees in Qingyunpu, planted during the Tang Dynasty.)</p>
<p>The elders of Hongdu and the citizens of Nanchang are eagerly looking towards Mount Lu, hoping for the arrival of the leader. Various unconfirmed rumors have been circulating from Guling in recent days, but they have not diminished the enthusiasm of anyone welcoming him. The temporary office of Chairman Jiang in Nanchang will be selected either at the Taishi Mansion or the Provincial Government. Accompanying personnel will stay at the Hongdu Reception Center. The telecommunications staff of the Xiang-E-Gan District Telecommunications Administration of the Ministry of Transportation, under the leadership of Director Hong, has created a second miracle after their great achievement in Guling. The necessary communication facilities for the Chairman's office have been prepared excellently. News reporters from Beijing, Shanghai, and Wuhan have also been well-treated, enjoying the convenience of rapidly transmitting news. The salaries of Nanchang telecommunications staff are very low due to funding shortages, often relying on future income and borrowing to make ends meet. However, their service ethic is second to none.</p>
<p>Jiangxi's literary tradition is strong, no less than that of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui. Education was very developed before the war. Now, due to the inability to recover, it is facing a dire situation. Fortunately, the news industry in Nanchang has shown significant progress. There are currently seven newspapers, including the Minguo Daily, China News, Xinwen Daily, Lixing Daily, Jiebao, Dazhong Daily, and Huaguang Daily. There are also the Wenshan Bao and the Xin Shangbao, Fengbao (evening paper). The content and format of the newspapers are no less than those of newspapers in other ports. The salaries of reporters are unbelievably low. It is said that the highest monthly salary is no more than 200,000 yuan. However, their work spirit and style are commendable. Most endearing is that they still retain the excellent local customs of courtesy and frugality from the time of Xu Ruzi.</p>
<p>Without visiting Jiangxi, one cannot know the inherent difficulties of politics in Jiangxi. The general criticism of Taishi Hui's achievements in Jiangxi is in accounting and statistics. The former was done very effectively, while the latter was done quite ordinarily. Later, following the examples of "Neng" and "Cao," these two tasks were also done satisfactorily. Therefore, at present, Jiangxi's civil administration, finance, construction, education, security, social affairs, and health must undergo reform to meet current needs. According to a Jiangxi elder, the geography of Jiangxi (referring to the Yangtze River, Poyang Lake, Gan River) has benefited and harmed Jiangxi (referring to the Yushu, Jiulian Mountains on the Guangdong-Jiangxi border, the Wuyi Mountains on the Fujian-Jiangxi border, and the Wugong Mountains and Wanyang Mountains on the Hunan-Jiangxi border). Those engaged in politics must work practically and proactively. According to the current urgent needs, civil administration, education, security, and health must be carried out boldly. As for finance, construction, and social affairs, they can be done step by step, aiming for daily progress without empty promises. It is crucial to avoid vanity and recklessness and to use fewer incompetent people.</p>
<p>The corruption at the grassroots level of Jiangxi's politics has not yet been eradicated. The political atmosphere at the provincial level is still considered upright. However, yesterday, reporters from Shanghai and Wuhan at a public banquet at the Chamber of Commerce heard a gentleman roughly describe the unsuitable practices of Nanchang tax officials in assessing business taxes and profit taxes. He also mentioned that Jiangxi's grain administration is also a painful issue. A good grain official who sacrificed his life for grain has already been laid to rest in the Martyrs' Cemetery next to Qingyunpu, but the province's grain has not yet been fully delivered. When people see the strict orders to transport the remaining grain, they seem to have unspeakable sadness. Everyone clenches their teeth and curses the Communist Party.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the reporter visited the Wanshou Palace in the urban area, still the only remaining magnificent building among the temples in Nanchang. The incense is very popular in the temple. It is said that from the eighth month of the lunar calendar to the end of the year, it consumes at least two to three million yuan every day.</p>
<p>The Nanchang-Ji'an highway was completed yesterday and opened to traffic today, allowing unimpeded passage from this province to Hunan, Guangdong, Fujian, and Anhui.</p>
<p>Among the outer counties, Huichang has the highest prices recently. The price of rice has risen to more than 50,000 yuan per stone.</p>
<p>The anti-banditry work on the Jiangxi-Guangdong border is progressing smoothly. Recently, 22 bandits were executed in Dayu, and 45 bandits were executed in Longnan in one go, greatly delighting the people. (Sent from Nanchang on the 17th)</p>

<h3>UNRRA Far East Regional Conference Concludes - UNRRA Food Rice to be Diverted to Famine Areas - Foreign Ships Assist in Transporting UNRRA Relief Supplies</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The UNRRA Far East Regional Conference continued at 11:15 AM on the 19th at the Bank of China Building, with Jiang Tingfu still serving as chairman. There were two key issues discussed: (1) US representative Kirkpatrick proposed that the world is experiencing a food shortage this year, and some areas of China are fortunately experiencing a good harvest. Therefore, he suggested that UNRRA food supplies to China be diverted to areas that are confirmed to be famine-stricken and can be reached by transportation. Jiang Tingfu believed that Kirkpatrick's proposal was clearly unfavorable to China and inconsistent with the resolutions of the UNRRA General Assembly. He immediately stated that China could not accept it and refuted it with reason. Jiang stated that if this proposal were passed, the Yellow River disaster area project would be halted, and it would be difficult to determine whether a certain area truly needed relief. China's better harvest this year is due to the climate, but some areas that were unable to plant due to war damage will still have no harvest even with a good climate. The US representative denied that this move would affect the Yellow River project and said that his proposal would allow relief efforts to be properly planned in advance. Soviet representative Seminass seconded the motion, saying that he had just returned from inspecting the disaster area and believed that the cause of the famine was not entirely due to the lack of food, but also due to improper distribution. Therefore, he believed that the US representative's proposal was "relevant and necessary." The case was then put to a vote, stating that the UNRRA Far East Regional Conference is a deliberative body, and all resolutions do not have legally binding force. (2) To increase the speed of UNRRA relief supply transportation, the US representative suggested assistance from foreign ships. Jiang Tingfu pointed out that this matter involved a wide range of issues and was quite complex, and said that the British representative would know this in detail. However, after a vote, it was still passed.</p>
<p>Finally, the Soviet representative urged the conference to consider General Tranard's organization of an air transport team, but he did not make a formal proposal, so no decision was made at the conference. The meeting adjourned at 1:00 PM in the afternoon. The 25th UNRRA Far East Regional Conference was thus concluded. The next conference is scheduled to be held on November 13.</p>
<h3>Zhejiang Provincial Assembly Proposes Many Motions - Closing Date Extended Again</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch from Hangzhou, 19th] Due to the large number of motions proposed at the Zhejiang Provincial Assembly, it could not be concluded as scheduled and has been decided to be extended again, with the closing date set for the 22nd. The assembly continued to discuss and pass motions, including requesting the Goods Tax Bureau to abolish inspection agencies along the way to facilitate merchants and travelers, and requesting the Ministry of Finance to reduce the tax rate on Shaoxing wine to 60% and improve the collection method.</p>
<h3>Yangcheng Lake Area Anti-Security Conference Holds Preparatory Meeting Today - Will Carefully Review Pacification Proposals</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch from Suzhou, 19th] Major General Ma Shigong, commander of the Yangcheng Lake area clearance command, decided to eliminate the lurking bandits in the jurisdiction by military force to consolidate security. He specially convened with Deputy Commander Xu Shiguang, ordering the county magistrates and military section chiefs of the four counties of Su, Chang, Kun, and Tai to report to the parachute command headquarters in Suzhou on the 20th to participate in the four-county security conference. It is learned that the focus of the conference will be on a thorough review of pacification proposals related to the distribution of local armed forces, the control of land and water transportation, the organization of communication networks, and the establishment of funding. The four county magistrates have first ordered their military section chiefs to arrive in Suzhou to attend the preparatory meeting on the 20th, and the county magistrates will gather in Suzhou on the 21st to participate in the formal meeting on the 22nd.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] Major General Fu Jinfang, commander of the Taihu Lake area clearance command, arrived in Suzhou on the 19th to preside over the commencement of clearance work. The reporter made a special visit to Fu to inquire about the working policy. He said: "The task of suppressing bandits depends on the assistance of the people to achieve greater results with less effort. Therefore, our only belief is to never disturb the people. All clearance units will bring their own supplies and strictly prohibit local requisitioning. Any violations will be severely punished."</p>
<h3>Hunan-Hubei Area Investigation Team - Requests Extension of Closing Date</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch from Hankou, 19th] The Hunan-Hubei-Jiangxi Area Investigation Team has requested an extension of its closing date to Beijing because the work has not yet been completed. According to sources, in the Wuhan takeover process, only the case of Xu Yuanyu, one of the "Four King Kongs," has been reported. Another case of a King Kong is about to be revealed. Therefore, the public is very interested in the team's movements.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous News from Various Places</h3>

<h3>Independent and Autonomous Foreign Policy</h3>
<p>Following his return from the Paris Peace Conference, our Minister of Foreign Affairs, Mr. Wang Shijie, held his first reception for Chinese and foreign journalists in Beijing the day before yesterday. He reiterated that our country's foreign policy is based on the principle of equality and mutual benefit when concluding commercial treaties with friendly nations. At a time when the United Kingdom, the United States, and France are all seeking to negotiate commercial treaties with our country, Minister Wang's statement is of great significance. He said, "The established policy of the Chinese government is to make every effort to utilize foreign capital and technology to develop China's resources and improve the living standards of the Chinese people. This is the guiding principle of our recent legislation regarding commercial company issues and related matters." He also stated, "The Chinese government intends to grant most-favored-nation treatment to all countries that will conclude strong commercial treaties with us. The condition for enjoying this treatment is reciprocity. China does not intend to adopt any discriminatory treatment against any foreign country in any part of its territory."</p>
<p>Minister Wang's remarks clearly and concisely explain the guiding principles of our country's foreign policy. They can not only dispel any doubts that various countries may have about our foreign policy, but also arouse the sympathy of countries around the world towards our country. However, its meaning is profound and requires further explanation.</p>
<p>First, foreign policy should be based on the needs of our own country. After eight years of arduous resistance war, our country has won victory, but it has long been exhausted. Looking at the domestic situation, the country is scarred and its vitality has not yet recovered. In addition, our country's production technology, whether in agriculture, industry, or mining, is very backward compared to friendly nations. In this environment, it is not easy to talk about national revival and construction. Fortunately, China has a vast territory, abundant resources, and a large population. As long as there is capital and technology, it is not difficult to develop these rich resources.</p>
<p>Dr. Sun Yat-sen's nation-building strategy has long pointed out the way for Chinese people to utilize foreign capital to develop resources. Now that we are about to engage in the work of construction, the first priority is to develop industry and commerce to improve the living standards of the people. Therefore, utilizing foreign capital and technology to develop resources is indeed the most urgent need at present. However, special attention must be paid to "sovereignty being in our hands," with everything determined by China's needs. We must not go astray and allow China to become a playground for foreign capital competition, gradually falling into the status of an economic semi-colony.</p>
<p>Second, foreign policy should have an independent and autonomous function. For its own needs, as well as for world peace and the progress of humanity, our country concludes commercial treaties with all friendly nations based on the principle of equality and mutual benefit, without discrimination against any country. This is entirely based on our country's autonomy and is not subject to any constraints. In terms of the current actual situation, our country's industry has not yet been industrialized and cannot stand on an equal footing with friendly nations. Reciprocity is simply out of the question. To be honest, so-called reciprocity means that China suffers a loss. However, friendly nations must know that there should be a limit to China's losses. Diplomacy is originally a political technique for defending national survival. If it cannot exert an independent and autonomous function, then the so-called equality and mutual benefit will lose its meaning.</p>
<p>Third, foreigners' view of China seems to have not yet been thoroughly reformed in its basic concept. When foreigners discuss Chinese politics, they either say "non-interference in China's internal affairs" or "China should remain outside the sphere of influence of the two major powers," or they say "open door" or "equal opportunity." In fact, these outdated clichés, in the eyes of ordinary Chinese people, seem to still not regard China as an independent and autonomous country. Even if foreigners do not have this intention, at least they have not recognized the position that China should occupy in world politics in the future. Minister Wang said, "If this attitude can be regarded as an open-door policy, then this so-called open door is actually China's own policy." In other words, since the door is our country's door, the sovereignty of whether to open it or not rests entirely in our country's hands. We open our door without harming our country's sovereignty, but if foreign countries must demand it of us, then it seems that China's door is to be decided by them.</p>
<p>Fourth, since our country's foreign policy is based on the principle of equality and mutual benefit, it will not allow any country to enjoy special privileges in our country. This is the unanimous wish of our country from top to bottom. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek personally expressed this view to the late US President Roosevelt in Cairo and obtained Roosevelt's agreement. But what is the actual situation at present? We will not talk about Hong Kong and the Kowloon leased territories being still under British rule, but have we jointly used Lushun and Dalian according to the Sino-Soviet treaty? Therefore, we have to point out that for countries enjoying special privileges in China, as long as their privileges are not abandoned, how the principle of equality and mutual benefit can be applied will inevitably become a major problem.</p>
<p>In short, diplomacy is an extension of domestic affairs and has its indivisible nature. Especially in an era when power politics prevails, in order for diplomacy to be powerful, it is even more necessary to improve domestic affairs. Although our country's foreign policy is theoretically very sound, it must first seek domestic unity and strength before there is hope for success.</p>
<h3>The Issue of Establishing a Governance Office in Kowloon City</h3>
<p>After the Shanghai Municipal Council passed a proposal requesting the government to expedite the recovery of Hong Kong and Kowloon, the issue of adjusting the governance of Kowloon City has become a hot topic in the past few days. The incident originated from the fact that the Shian County Government of Guangdong Province intended to send personnel to establish a governance office in Kowloon City within its jurisdiction. Our Ministry of Foreign Affairs, based on the 1898 Beijing Treaty, believed that this was feasible. Just as preparations were underway, a spokesperson for the Hong Kong government suddenly stated: "The jurisdictional rights of Chinese officials in Kowloon City have been declared suspended because they conflict with the military needs of the British side." Our country's diplomatic authorities then issued a statement denying the allegations of the Hong Kong government spokesperson, believing that according to the 1898 Sino-British Treaty, which allowed "the Chinese officials currently stationed in Kowloon City to continue to perform their duties in the city, provided that they do not interfere with the military preparations for the defense of Hong Kong," our country could certainly send personnel to establish a governance office in Kowloon City, and had not relinquished the jurisdictional rights in Kowloon City, especially since the duties of each official "must not interfere with the military preparations for the defense of Hong Kong." The case of establishing a governance office in Kowloon City is currently being negotiated with the Hong Kong side by the Special Commissioner of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for Guangdong and Guangxi. The people of the country are closely watching how it will develop in the future.</p>
<p>Kowloon City is the site where fortifications were built and garrisons were established in the Qing Dynasty to defend the sea borders. Its occupied area is not large. Even before the Pacific War, it had already been abandoned and dilapidated, only serving as a place to reminisce and lament the past. The British have managed Hong Kong and Kowloon, but have allowed Kowloon City to remain desolate. This shows that Chinese officials should have been stationed in Kowloon City to perform their respective duties. From a legal point of view, there is absolutely no question that our country retains sovereignty over Kowloon City. However, now that the people of the whole country are expecting a solution to the entire Hong Kong and Kowloon issue, hoping to see Hong Kong and Kowloon return to the embrace of the motherland as soon as possible, the proposal to establish a governance office in Kowloon City at this time seems a bit like creating unnecessary complications and neglecting the fundamental for the trivial. We certainly do not suspect that this is an attempt to divert the attention of the people of the country, from the recovery of the entire Hong Kong and Kowloon to the establishment of a governance office in Kowloon City. But the proposal of this issue will undoubtedly confuse the theme of recovering Hong Kong and Kowloon. What we want to win back now is not an abandoned Kowloon City, but the entire Hong Kong and Kowloon! Whether the proposal of this kind of trivial issue can be beneficial to the recovery of the entire Hong Kong and Kowloon is really worth our consideration.</p>
<p>Interstate relations are like personal relationships. We cannot ignore the relationship of emotion. The current international situation is such, and our domestic political situation has not yet become stable. At this time, we need friends even more. China and the United Kingdom suffered the most in World War II. China resisted the aggression of the Japanese militarists independently in Asia, and the United Kingdom also resisted the aggression of the Nazis independently in Europe. China and the United Kingdom are friends in adversity. On the reconstruction of the post-war world order, China and the United Kingdom need to work closely together. Churchill, who "did not come to liquidate the empire," could not get the support of the British people with his great achievements for the United Kingdom, which shows that they had a clear understanding of their country's future. The government formed by Attlee originally advocated amending the traditional British policy to adapt to the new environment of today. The withdrawal of British troops from Egypt and the granting of independence to India are all indications of changes in British foreign policy. Under this situation, the recovery of Hong Kong and Kowloon seems not difficult to achieve. In diplomatic relations, it is important to use them properly. At this time, we should seek to make friends with other countries, and we cannot ignore the United Kingdom, which has traditional relations with us. Therefore, we should now cherish the friendship between China and the United Kingdom. The proposal of establishing a governance office in Kowloon City may be an unpleasant event in Sino-British relations. If we think from a long-term perspective, we feel that the proposal of this kind of trivial issue gives people the feeling of seeing an autumn hair but not a cartload of firewood. Observing that the British ambassador visited Minister Wang without mentioning the issue of establishing a governance office in Kowloon City, we can know that this issue has not yet attracted diplomatic attention.</p>
<p>In short, for the place where sovereignty lies, even an inch of land, we should certainly fight for it. That is absolutely no problem. However, now that the people of the whole country are eagerly awaiting the recovery of the entire Hong Kong and Kowloon, the proposal of establishing a governance office in Kowloon City has turned the theme towards complexity and triviality. If the entire Hong Kong and Kowloon are recovered, there will certainly be no problem like this Kowloon City. We want to ask, what does the government intend to do to negotiate the recovery of Hong Kong and Kowloon? But at the same time, we want to declare that the demand for the recovery of Hong Kong and Kowloon is for China and also for the United Kingdom, and should certainly not be regarded as the Chinese people having the slightest anti-foreign sentiment.</p>
<h3>The Villagers are Crying!</h3>
<p>Ripe rice, fat ducklings, fresh fish and crabs, lotus roots as big as boats, green water caltrop and red water caltrop contrasting with each other, what a beautiful autumn scene of a land of fish and rice in Jiangnan. However, in this beautiful picture, there are large numbers of villagers with pure souls crying! The atomic bomb brought the country victory, but the atomic bomb cannot take away the villagers' tragic fate. The exploitation of the enemy collaborators, the post-war trauma, the pain is still heavily pressing on the villagers. The township society is getting poorer and poorer, the villagers' lives are also getting lower and lower, and the dream of living in peace and starting a business has become the sorrow of disillusionment. The villagers, who are destined to be ill-fated, seem sad, seem sentimental, but are actually fearful!</p>
<p>Today's villagers actually live in a "bandit" world, where they cannot eat or sleep in peace. Robberies occur almost every day, everywhere, at night, and also during the day. The bandits are either many or few, and the many possess hundreds of people, looking like an army, with machine guns and small steel cannons. They even openly send letters to the district office, demanding provisions, otherwise they will enter the town by force. The district office reports to the county government, and the county magistrate issues a document, telling them to defend themselves. Self-defense requires people, self-defense requires money, and self-defense requires guns even more; even if manpower and financial resources can come from the local area, where do the guns come from? Private individuals are prohibited from hiding guns, and the government does not issue or sell guns, how can they defend themselves? They are just deceiving people! There is no police force in the townships, and the Baojia organization only plays a corrupting side effect. The good people can only sit and wait to be robbed, or move to big cities. The urban population has increased sharply. In addition to escaping the disaster of the Communist Party, the abundance of bandits is also a main reason. Producers are turning into consumers, which is further causing a situation where those who produce are few and those who eat are many. How can the people not become poorer and the wealth not be exhausted?</p>
<p>The villagers' farming has already reached the end of the road. The price of rice is suppressed and cheap, while wages and prices are rising steadily. Unfortunately, there is a tendency to evolve into "cheap grain hurting farmers." Taking the eastern township of Kunshan near Shanghai as an example, taking one mu of land as a calculation, the best harvest can get one and a half shi of rice. Each shi of rice is currently worth 40,000 yuan, and one mu can get 60,000 yuan, which is almost the same as the cost. Each mu needs one bean cake for fertilizer, 12,000 yuan, five workers for contracting work, each worker at a minimum price of 4,000 yuan, a total of 20,000 yuan, and also six dou of rice for rent, 24,000 yuan. How much is left? The villagers work hard all year round, what are they doing it for! When the rice is sold, the price of rice is particularly cheap. The villagers have to repay their debts and must use glutinous rice; when the glutinous rice is gone, the rice price rises again. In March and April, when the new crop is not yet harvested, the farmers have no rice to cook, and they have to buy expensive rice. The people who grow rice cannot eat cheap rice themselves. Is there anything more unfair in the world than this? As for the requisition of military grain, it is another bad luck for the villagers. The grain purchase money issued from above is initially similar to the market price, but the people who handle this payment below use it for profit-making purposes. When the order is urgent and the grain is to be delivered, the price of rice is already expensive at this time, so they forcibly suppress the villagers and collect rice at a low price. What have the villagers done wrong to bear this heavy burden!</p>
<p>Township education is on the verge of bankruptcy. With bankrupt education, how can education not go bankrupt? The county does not have education funds and requires the townships to raise half of them. It is stipulated that the local area will maintain it for the first three months of the school year, and then the county government will find a way for the next three months. The townships are too busy raising funds to prevent bandits, how can they care about education? Therefore, they have to charge tuition and miscellaneous fees. Although the fees of around 20,000 yuan are just a drop in the bucket for the school, they are already unaffordable for the parents. As a result, a large number of school-age children are out of school. The salary of township teachers, including everything, is only 60,000 to 70,000 yuan per month. Is this little money better used to buy rice or buy vegetables? Some teachers are forced to hire teaching assistants and work as peddlers themselves. If they follow the rules and take the right path, there is only a dead end!</p>
<p>Because of poverty and ignorance, villagers have particularly many diseases and they are particularly prevalent. The enemy who invaded the country has gone, and the enemy who invaded the body remains, waiting for us to fight against it. Returning to the village after demobilization, looking at the fellow villagers, hardly anyone is there. Some died like morning dew, while others were buried in the night. "Time slips away like a fleeting glimpse, and even a boat cannot be secured for long." The mountains and rivers are in sight, but people are far away. The dead are all young and strong people, mostly dying from tuberculosis, dysentery, typhoid fever, and cholera. Most of the young people who are alive are suffering from malaria, tuberculosis, indigestion, venereal diseases, trachoma, and scabies. The villagers do not understand preventive knowledge, and there is no scientific diagnosis and treatment, so they do not know how many lives are being wasted. The number of normal pregnant women and healthy babies who should not have died but died is also alarming. Chinese people are worthless, and Chinese villagers are even more worthless; when a person dies, it is like the death of a cat or the death of a dog, and it is passed over lightly. This phenomenon is spreading in every township in the country.</p>
<p>The unfilial traitors in the cities have mostly bowed their heads in front of legal justice, while the spineless traitors in the townships, because the villagers dare to be angry but dare not speak, are still at large. The money they obtained shamelessly is being used to buy fields, buy land, open stores, and open factories under assumed names, and they are still overbearing. After another period of time, I am afraid they will be full of morality again, acting as gentlemen with powdered noses, oppressing the good people. And the bright and righteous people who are unharmed by water and fire, on the contrary, do not have enough food and clothing, and things are getting worse. Such a society in the township that is neither black nor white only makes the loyal people cower and the cunning ones succeed! The traitors welcome the invaders as their fathers, pretending to be powerful by wearing the skin of tigers, selling out the country, and oppressing their compatriots, offsetting the power of the resistance war, and prolonging and deepening the pain of the villagers. Their crimes are actually worse than the enemies. When I hear the villagers say, "We are not afraid of the enemy, we are really afraid of the traitors." It is also a shameful thing that such scum has come out of the simple countryside. The important foundation of our resistance war is the righteous spirit of the nation. If these national dregs are not punished, there will be no such thing as justice in the world. The officials who are close to the people should first eliminate the traitors in the townships.</p>
<p>Our country is established on agriculture. Confucius said "prosperity" and Mencius said "permanent property," all of which are inseparable from agricultural affairs. Culture originated in farming, but now the township society is unstable, the villagers have thousands of disasters and hundreds of difficulties, how can agriculture develop? How can culture be rooted? The plan for now is, first, to stop the internal turmoil and seek a peaceful and unified country, strictly enforce the Baojia system, disarm and dismiss the scattered military guerrilla teams, issue firearms, strengthen and organize local self-defense teams, and help each other with neighboring towns to thoroughly solve the bandits. The prices of rice, goods, and wages should be adjusted at the same time to eliminate the abnormal market. The requisition of military grain should be limited to a short period and should be done during the grain ripening season. The central government should subsidize local education with large funds. Health agencies should be widely dispatched to the countryside, and health education should be widely implemented. According to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's statement in 1944 that traitors would be strictly dealt with, we must ensure that the loyal and the treacherous cannot stand together and that the evil and the righteous must be distinguished, so that good people have courage. This needs to be proven by shooting a bullet through the chest of every vicious traitor!</p>

<h3>Wallace to Remain in Current Position, Foreign Policy Debate Truce, Agreement Reached Yesterday with President Truman, Guaranteed Silence Until End of Peace Conference</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 18th] Secretary of Commerce Wallace went to the White House today to visit President Truman for a long talk. Afterwards, Wallace told reporters that he would remain in his current position but guaranteed not to make public speeches for the time being. Wallace's official statement said: "The President and the Secretary of Commerce had a long and friendly discussion. Afterwards, the Secretary concluded that he should temporarily refrain from making public statements or speeches until the end of the Paris Peace Conference." The difficult situation caused by Wallace's speech attacking Secretary of State Byrnes' foreign policy at Madison Square Garden in New York on the 12th of this month has thus been clarified. According to Wallace's aides, Wallace guaranteed silence after President Truman agreed with some of Wallace's views on American foreign policy. However, political observers pointed out that Wallace did this in order to retain his right to speak in the future. Once the peace conference ends, Wallace will again make public remarks, creating domestic tensions again, which will be enough to affect the general election in November of this year.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 19th] After President Truman and Secretary of Commerce Wallace met last night, a truce in the American foreign policy war has been established. Therefore, whether the American cabinet crisis can be avoided depends on the attitude of Secretary of State Byrnes, as Byrnes has the inherent right to preserve or break this "truce." So far, Byrnes has not announced any reaction to the compromise reached between Truman and Wallace. President Truman talked with Wallace for two and a half hours, and Wallace has expressed his willingness to shut up, so it is expected that Byrnes will continue to allow this person, whose foreign policy views are in extreme conflict with his own, to serve in the cabinet. The New York Times commented that Wallace no longer has the freedom to speak. In fact, there is no harm in Wallace not being a cabinet member and expressing his opinions to the public. The problem now is that there are two people in the cabinet who advocate opposing foreign policies at the same time. I wonder if their foreign policy can stand up.</p>
<p>Waiting for News from the White House, Byrnes will Decide His Attitude Again</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Washington, 19th Radio Paris News: US Secretary of State Byrnes lives in seclusion and only interacts with British representative Alexander. Byrnes has not made any criticism so far, and will express his attitude at least after the results of the Truman-Wallace meeting are announced tonight. The British delegation believes that this matter will not weaken Byrnes' position and is purely an internal American matter. Although the French representative also insisted that this is an internal American affair, he revealed anxiety. A diplomat openly pointed out that this matter seriously affects the position of the American delegation in the peace conference.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 18th] White House Press Secretary Ross announced that Secretary of Commerce Wallace sent a letter to President Truman on August 23, a copy of which has been delivered by the President to Secretary of State Byrnes, and the original letter has been filed in the White House. No one seems to know how the contents of this letter fell into the hands of American reporters.</p>

<h3>Before the Opening of the United Nations General Assembly, the Peace Conference Can Conclude its Work, the Trieste Issue Still in Dispute</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Paris, 19th Radio: The Paris Peace Conference has been overshadowed by the uproar caused internationally by Wallace's speech, but the committees are working hard to speed up their work in order to conclude the conference's mission before the opening of the United Nations General Assembly on October 23. The two most important committees of the peace conference, the Political Committee for Italy and the Economic Committee for Italy, stepped up their work last night, because judging from the current pace of work, there is little hope of ending the work of the committees on October 5. So far, the Political Committee for Italy has still failed to resolve the dispute over the southern border of Italy and Trieste, and the Economic Committee for Italy is being troubled by the issue of compensation. The work that is progressing relatively quickly is only the Military Committee and the Political Committees for Bulgaria and Finland, especially the Military Committee, because the military terms of the Italian peace treaty have almost all been completed.</p>
<h3>Military Committee Approves Limits on Italian Navy and Army</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Paris, 18th] The Peace Conference Military Committee today approved the provisions restricting armaments in the Italian peace treaty, stipulating that the Italian Navy be reduced to two battleships. Four cruisers and destroyers each, and a number of small warships. The army's headcount is reduced to 250,000, and heavy and medium tanks are limited to 200. Most of the remaining warships will be divided by the four powers, and the rest will be dismantled.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 18th] The Economic Committee for Italy met today and, after discussing Article 66, immediately passed its first paragraph (i.e., Italy relinquishes all claims against the United Nations), the second paragraph (i.e., the Italian government must repay the currency issued by the Allied Command in Italy), and the third paragraph (i.e., Italy must not make any claims regarding the measures taken by the Allied Powers to deal with Italian ships). In addition, the Trieste subcommittee also met this afternoon to discuss the powers that the legislative council of the district should have. The atmosphere was very tense and no agreement was reached. Representatives of various countries either advocated the establishment of an authoritative government, or argued with the opposition, with no progress.</p>
<h3>Hu Shize Arrives in Paris</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 18th] Chinese representative Hu Shize, who was sent here by United Nations Secretary-General Lie to be his private observer attending the Paris Peace Conference, arrived here this afternoon.</p>
<h3>United Nations General Assembly Session to Last Six to Seven Weeks</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] San Francisco, 19th Radio: The United Nations General Assembly is scheduled to be held on October 23. There are many difficult issues on the agenda, such as the admission of new member states, the election of the Security Council, and trusteeship issues. Other issues, such as the Spanish issue and the veto power of the five permanent members, may also be raised, but only with unanimous consent can they be placed on the agenda. The President of the General Assembly is Spaak, and the Vice-Presidents are the chief representatives of the delegations of China, France, the Soviet Union, South Africa, the United Kingdom, the United States, and Venezuela. The General Assembly will last approximately seven weeks, meeting six days a week, with no evening sessions. The meetings of the General Assembly and its committees are open to the public.</p>
<h3>Franco Once Received Money and Arms from Germany and Italy</h3>
<p>[United Press, Madrid, 18th] The Franco government, which once received financial and military assistance from Germany to seize power, may soon find itself in an awkward position and be forced to settle the matter with the United Nations. Since Franco's rise against the Spanish democratic government on July 18, 1936, Germany and Italy have begun to provide aid. Mussolini's aid between 1939 and 1945 amounted to five billion lire. In December last year, Spain negotiated with the newly established Italian government, due to the low value of the lira, setting its debt at $50 million. A spokesman for the Spanish Foreign Ministry called this debt a "debt of honor." The amount of aid Hitler provided to the Franco government has never been disclosed, but well-informed sources estimate it to be about 400 to 500 million marks. According to pre-war values, this would be no less than $160 to $200 million. During the war, Spain transported various goods to Germany, estimated to have repaid 300 million marks. The United Nations Control Commission for Germany, as the custodian of the German people, is currently liquidating the accounts between Germany and various neutral countries. Agreements have been reached with Switzerland and Sweden, and negotiations are underway with Portugal, with Spain being next in line.</p>
<h3>Instability on the Greek Border</h3>
<p>Plan to Seek Assistance from the United Nations</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Athens, 18th] According to reliable sources, the Greek border has recently been attacked by armed forces from neighboring countries. The Greek government plans to seek assistance from the United Nations Security Council to ensure the security of the Greek border. Furthermore, according to official announcements, assassinations are increasing in Greece, and robberies and arson are particularly rampant.</p>
<h3>Chinese Representative on Security Council Argues Against Emphasizing the Greek Issue, to Avoid a Political Mistake</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Lake Success, 18th] The United Nations Security Council met today to continue discussing the Ukrainian representative's complaint against Greece. The Dutch representative, Kleffens, proposed that the Secretary-General of the Council call upon the governments of Greece, Yugoslavia, Albania, and Bulgaria to do their utmost to prevent border disputes. The Chinese representative expressed the opinion that the Council was too preoccupied with the Greek issue, which would constitute a political error. This issue is merely a temporary phenomenon in the international situation. From a legal perspective, the situation in Greece does not threaten peace and security. The French representative, Parodi, also stated that the Security Council had no reason to further discuss the issue of British troops stationed in Greece or to assume that Greece harbored aggressive intentions. However, the Council should form a sub-committee to discuss border incidents. The Soviet representative, Gromyko, insisted that the Greek government was pursuing an aggressive policy and that the American proposal to establish a commission of inquiry was an attempt to divert attention.</p>
<h3>British Government Denies Polish Troops Concentrating in Transjordan</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 18th] Reports circulating in the capitals of both the Soviet Union and Poland that Polish troops under the command of General Anders, currently stationed in the Middle East, will concentrate in Transjordan have been denied by well-informed sources in London.</p>
<h3>UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization Headquarters Moves to Paris</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Paris, 18th] The headquarters of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) moved here today from London, according to the resolution of the United Nations London Conference in November last year, to establish its permanent headquarters. The organization's preparatory committee is preparing for all matters related to the first UNESCO conference to be held in Paris on November 15.</p>
<h3>British Mediterranean Fleet to Visit Greek Territorial Waters Again</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] London, 19th Broadcasting from Athens: The British Embassy stated that the British Mediterranean Fleet, including four cruisers and one aircraft carrier, will visit Greek territorial waters twice in the next four weeks. The fleet will leave Malta on Friday and dock at the Greek naval base of Nauplia in the Gulf of Argos.</p>
<h3>Anglo-Egyptian Treaty</h3>
<p>Egyptian Nationalist Party Determined Not to Recognize</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Cairo, 18th] The Egyptian Nationalist Party, a powerful political party, held a meeting in Alexandria and decided not to recognize any Anglo-Egyptian alliance treaty unless it fully meets Egypt's demands, in which case a separate discussion will be held. This resolution will be notified to all embassies.</p>
<h3>Churchill Calls on France and Germany to Join Hands in Speech in Switzerland, Hoping to Rebuild the European Family</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Zurich, 19th] British wartime Prime Minister Winston Churchill delivered a speech at the University of Zurich today, reviewing the German question. He stated, "We must deprive Germany of all opportunities to rearm, as a permanent solution. However, it must be stated that if we want to rebuild the international family of Europe, France and Germany must reconcile. France must restore its moral influence over Europe, and France and Germany will remain the two most vibrant countries in Europe. We must establish and support the United Nations to establish the European family. This family, we call it the United States of Europe, or propose it with other names, all are possible."</p>

<h3>Few Men in Vienna, Difficult for Women to Find Mates</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] London, 19th Broadcasting from Vienna: According to Vienna municipal statistics, the city has a population of over 1.6 million, of which women account for over 930,000 and men only 660,000. In terms of women finding mates, there is a clear shortage of men, and Vienna women will have to wait about twenty years before they have equal opportunities. However, according to another statistic, in May 1946, Vienna had a total of 476 boys born and 395 girls born. If this trend continues unchanged, the supply and demand of men and women will soon be balanced.</p>

<h3>New Contributions to Global Economic Cooperation: Two International Financial Institutions to Finalize Regulations</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 18th] The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the International Monetary Fund, after four years of preparation, are largely ready and will soon assist countries in need around the world. The two major institutions have reserves of over $15 billion, opening a new era for international economic cooperation. The governments of 30 member states will send delegates to Washington on the 27th of this month to finalize the regulations of the two institutions, and they are expected to open for business in about three months. The tasks of the institutions are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) To maintain each country's currency on a balanced basis, so that the people of each country can trust their own and other countries' currencies, creating the possibility of promoting trade. (2) To provide any kind of short-term loans to countries that do not have funds to purchase goods from other countries. This will allow these countries to continue importing goods and manufacturing products for export. (3) To provide long-term, low-interest loans to assist countries in reconstruction and development, especially those affected by war. This will help rebuild industries and even build new industries. This project is a long and arduous task, and it will take many years to see results. At the same time, another similar institution, the International Trade Organization, initiated by the United States, is still in the planning stage and is expected to be established in the second half of next year. The purpose of this institution is to find ways to reduce tariffs and eliminate other restrictions that hinder the exchange of goods between countries.</p>

<h3>Arab Secret Army Prepares to Resist Jewish Riots</h3>
<p>Jews Implement Disobedience Movement</p>

<h3>How Much Silkworm Cocoon Remained in Japan I Request MacArthur to Investigate Thoroughly The Claim That Chinese Silk Suffices for Factory Needs Is Not True</h3>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 19th] Li Binghan, spokesman for the Chinese delegation, told foreign reporters this morning that the delegation had requested MacArthur to investigate the "surplus" Japanese silkworm cocoons. China had requested that these silkworm cocoons be used for barter trade, but the Allied Headquarters had not yet agreed. If the Allied Headquarters does not reconsider its policy of stopping the shipment of surplus Japanese silk to China, the Chinese silk industry will face serious difficulties. The claim reported by United Press that Chinese silk factories already have silk available for use is not true. There are rumors in Tokyo and elsewhere that a commercial group is attempting to monopolize the Japanese silk industry. Although the Chinese delegation does not believe in these rumors, it sincerely hopes that MacArthur Headquarters will conduct a thorough investigation to clarify how many silkworm cocoons are available for import into China.</p>
<h3>Overseas Chinese in Vietnam Value New Franco-Vietnamese Agreement</h3>
<p>Overseas Chinese Merchants Will Be Restricted in the Future</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Hanoi, 18th] The 500,000 overseas Chinese in Vietnam have a direct relationship with the new Franco-Vietnamese agreement. The overseas Chinese unanimously welcomed the signing of the new Franco-Vietnamese agreement, which has stabilized the chaotic situation in Vietnam to some extent. The unification of the Vietnamese monetary system, making the chaotic currency of Vietnam today uniform, is naturally beneficial to overseas Chinese. However, the establishment of a customs union and completely equal commercial treatment between France and Vietnam, as stipulated in the new agreement, is noteworthy. French businesses will be able to enjoy various privileges based on this, and the businesses of overseas Chinese in Vietnam for decades will inevitably be restricted as a result. They believe that overseas Chinese will now be based on the Sino-French treaty to conduct business here. If the new Franco-Vietnamese agreement is far from the Sino-French treaty, the overseas Chinese will ask the government to fight for it.</p>
<h3>Redistribution of Land in the American Zone of Occupation in Germany</h3>
<p>The Aim Is to Eliminate Large Landowners</p>
<p>[Reuters, Stuttgart, 18th] A large area of land in the American zone of Germany will be broken up and used for farming by farmers. This land redistribution law, drafted by representatives of the three states in the American zone, has been approved by the American military government. The purpose is not only to eliminate the political power of large landowners, but also to provide a place for homeless farmers, especially the Germans expelled from Eastern European countries. All land that is not personally cultivated, where the landlord does not reside on the land for most of the year, land that is poorly cultivated, land that refuses to pay grain in kind, and land that is more than 100 hectares per person are subject to re-allocation.</p>

<h3>One of Ali Baba's Forty Thieves Captured at Cairo, Former Nazi Prisoner of War</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Cairo, 19th] German prisoners of war escaping in Egypt are not uncommon. Recently, a German prisoner was found hiding in a large stack on the roof of a house in Cairo, like one of Ali Baba's forty thieves. He was deported from Abyssinia to Egypt for detention. After escaping, he served in a clothing store set up by an Egyptian without being recognized. Later, as the situation became tense, he hid in the stack. There are fewer reports of Italian prisoners escaping.</p>
<h3>Exposure of Japanese-German Collusion: International Court Presented Evidence Yesterday The Axis Powers' Plan Was to First Take Singapore, The Attack on Pearl Harbor Was the Last Scheme of the Japanese Military</h3>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 19th] Prosecutors at the Far East International Tribunal began exposing the Axis conspiracy today. Former Prime Minister Hideki Tojo was deeply convinced that Japan's power was sufficient to defeat the United States and had assured Germany that only a portion of its forces would be needed to subdue the United States. Deputy Prosecutor Wenner claimed that Tojo had told former German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop that there was no need to worry about fighting the United States on land. At that time, Germany made various demands on Japan: (1) Occupy Singapore and destroy the British fortress in the Pacific, causing a major blow to its war against Germany. (2) Keep the United States busy in the Pacific, unable to participate in the European war. (3) Japan should fight against the Soviet Union before conquering British, French, and Dutch territories in the South. Tavena also said that although Japan was prepared for war before July 1941, it had not decided to go to war with the United States, which shows that there were other unpublished reasons between July and December 1941 that caused Japan to suddenly attack Pearl Harbor. After Hitler obtained the supreme command of the German army, Germany's Asian policy changed, not only withdrawing all aid and guidance to China, but also hoping that Japan could deal a final blow to China. According to Hitler's decision, if the United States joined the European war, Japan should attack Singapore and the Philippines. Unexpectedly, between July and December 1941, the Japanese war party made a major decision to attack Pearl Harbor, which affected the overall situation. The former ambassador to Germany, Oshima, and the ambassador to Italy, Shiratori Toshio, both deceived Tokyo and guided Germany to induce Japan to participate in the European war. The development of German-Japanese relations during these years is as follows: [1936] The Japanese Kwantung Army was afraid of a Soviet attack from the north and did not dare to go south. [1937] Germany was dissatisfied with Japan's incident in China. After the July 7th Lugou Bridge Incident, it warned Japan to be responsible to the world. [1938] Hitler obtained supreme command, withdrew all military advisers from China, stopped supplying military materials, and recognized the puppet state of Manchukuo. In October of that year, Germany and Japan jointly recognized their enemy as the Soviet Union. [1939] Oshima and Shiratori refused to transmit Tokyo's telegrams to the German government that they should consult before taking any military action against the Soviet Union. The German-Soviet agreement frightened Japan. [1940] The United States and Britain showed an increasingly tough attitude towards the puppet government established by Japan in China.</p>
<p>Japan's southward advance would surround Vietnam and Siam, making Germany uneasy, but Japan assured Germany that it would trap the US fleet in the Pacific, preventing it from participating in the European war. Ambassador Kurusu told Germany that if Japan occupied Singapore, it could help Germany end the war against Britain sooner. [1941] Oshima informed Germany that Singapore must be occupied by large-scale land and sea operations. Hitler personally agreed to give Germany's scientific inventions to Japan, and also agreed to fight. Japan informed Germany that if the United States joined the European war, Japan did not intend to attack the United States immediately. Between July and December of that year, Japan changed its plan to attack Singapore due to unpublished incidents and attacked Pearl Harbor on December 7.</p>
<p>Deputy Prosecutor Tavena presented an overview of various documents to prove that Japan's decision to attack Pearl Harbor was the last decision among its thorough conquest plans. The Japanese military, after recognizing the new situation in the late summer of 1941, decided to attack Pearl Harbor. Before this, most Japanese leaders still wanted to destroy Britain's Singapore base and create a prosperous East Asian empire, only showing the minimum force to the United States. They had been discussing military conquest plans with Germany since 1939, lasting four years. In September 1940, former Japanese Army Minister Tojo declared at a Privy Council meeting: "With the strength of our army, we can go to war with the United States. It is enough to use only a part of our full strength." Later, when Japan and Germany negotiated the Axis Pact, the focus was entirely on occupying Singapore, which was considered a fatal blow sufficient to destroy Allied forces in Asia. Germany wanted Japan to sweep away Britain's forces in the Far East and directly or indirectly keep the United States busy interfering in Europe. Japan was preparing to challenge both Britain and the United States, but various documents only occasionally mentioned the possibility of attacking the Philippines. Even at the Imperial Conference in July 1941, there was no preparation for the attack on Pearl Harbor.</p>
<p>It is also known that when the trial opened today, Deputy Prosecutor Tavena began a new stage of the case, reading the words of Oshima, the former ambassador to Germany, admitting that he had secretly planned with Ribbentrop. Tavena said: "I will prove that the negotiation of the military treaty was conducted through the Japanese military channel. I will also prove that the Japanese army was so powerful that it could force the government to act according to the army's will." Defendant lawyer Logan quickly seized the opportunity and asked: "Is this saying new, Mr. Tavena, are you representing yourself? Or are you speaking on behalf of the entire prosecution team?" If the prosecutor admits that the Japanese military controls the government and is so strong, then the Japanese cabinet members and other government leaders on trial may be able to exculpate themselves from war crimes by simply executing the military's tough orders. President Webb said: This point is a concern of the court. Tavena looked a little dazed, so Webb adjourned the court five minutes early, "giving him a moment to think," obviously to facilitate Tavena's consultation with Wanam. Also, when Tavena mentioned that Tojo was confident that he could defeat the United States and boasted that only a part of the Japanese army was needed to defeat the United States, Tojo stared at the ceiling in the defendant's seat and slowly scratched his chin.</p>

<h3>Review Results of the Municipal Government's Annual Expenditure Budget: Reduce Administrative Expenses, Increase Project Expenses; Revenue and Expenditure Difference Approximately 20 Billion; Collection of Donations and Taxes Pending Assembly Decision</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The Ninth Budget Review Committee held its final review meeting yesterday at 6:00 PM at the Shanghai Municipal Council in Fuming Village. The speaker and conveners of each group were specially invited to jointly review, along with Finance Bureau Director Gu Chunfan, Municipal Government Accounting Director Min Xiangfan, and Land Administration Bureau Director Zhu Ping, totaling approximately twenty people.</p>
<p>First, the convener of the Ninth Group, Xu Yongzuo, stated that due to the rushed timeframe and limited information, a detailed review of the budget could not be conducted. Considering the 33.3 billion yuan difference between revenue and expenditure for the second half of the year, the only way to bridge the gap is to "increase revenue and reduce expenditure."</p>
<p>Regarding expenditures, the total annual expenditure is 84.7 billion yuan. After the review committee's examination, it is proposed to reduce personnel expenses by applying a universal 15% reduction to the 52.5 billion yuan allocated for personnel, which could reduce the amount by over 7.87 billion yuan. Unnecessary expenditures will be eliminated, and procurement and repair costs will be reduced by 30%, saving over 500 million yuan. Approximately 2.39 billion yuan will be reduced by cutting and consolidating organizations. It is proposed to abolish: (1) the Housing Rental Committee, and (2) the police department's mounted patrol unit. Aside from living allowances, the budget for the mounted patrol unit is over 160 million yuan, which should be eliminated to strengthen the vehicle patrol unit. The budget for the vehicle patrol unit is 1.64 million yuan. If two additional teams are added, then an additional 150 million yuan would be required. A total of 10.777 billion yuan could be saved. This would make the actual budget 73.939 billion yuan, but expenditures for constructive projects will be accepted in full.</p>
<p>On the revenue side, the review determined that revenue should be increased by 3.756 billion yuan. The actual revenue and expenditure difference will then be 18.793 billion yuan.</p>
<p>Later, Councilor Li Wenjie presented a statistical report on revenue and expenditure increases and decreases: The budget for constructive project expenses should be 26.8 billion yuan, including: 2.78 billion yuan for education and culture, 11.9 billion yuan for public works, 1.1 billion yuan for public utilities, 6.9 billion yuan for health, 320 million yuan for social welfare, 1.5 billion yuan for security police, 560 million yuan for finance, 1.1 billion yuan for land administration, plus 500 million yuan for public buses and small loans.</p>
<p>Three Principles for Reducing Expenditures</p>
<p>There are three principles for reducing expenditures: (1) Personnel who have been added to each bureau but not yet formally employed will not be included in the budget; (2) Among the 9,000 workers and 3,500 laborers in the municipal government and its affiliated agencies, the number of workers should be appropriately reduced; (3) Independent units should be merged as much as possible, such as the Public Utilities Bureau's pier and warehouse management office. The reduction standard will be determined based on the circumstances. Furthermore, the Ninth Group Review Committee initiated a proposal for Municipal Councilors to forgo their transportation allowance of 10,000 yuan per person. Although this would save only a few million yuan, it represents the councilors' example of thrift.</p>
<p>The principle for increasing revenue is to not increase the burden on the general public. The types of revenue that can be increased include vehicle license tax, banquet tax, new vehicle registration fees, slaughterhouse business revenue, and sanitation revenue.</p>
<p>After the convener finished reporting, Councilor Wang Xianqing reported that the Wine and Cuisine Association had petitioned to reduce the banquet tax from 20% to 10% and to only tax meals over 20,000 yuan. In addition, the Hotel Association also petitioned to exempt hotel tax. Finance Bureau Director Gu Chunfan explained that the council could decide to reduce the tax rate, but current banquet tax revenues reach 2 billion yuan per month. Cutting it in half would reduce it to 1 billion yuan, resulting in a 6 billion yuan shortfall for six months, which would have to be compensated for through other means. Director Gu also explained that the hotel tax was not mandated by the central government but decided by the Provisional Council. If the hotel tax is exempted, residents staying in hotels will not bear tax responsibilities.</p>
<p>Reports and Explanations from Each Group Convener</p>
<p>Subsequently, the conveners of each group reported and explained the increased budgets required for various facilities. After discussion by the review committee, a preliminary resolution was made: Regarding police affairs, it was requested that fire protection fees be increased by 1 billion yuan. Because fire protection is a major concern, the fire department has only purchased some leather belts since the victory. Therefore, in addition to the 500 million yuan already allocated for purchasing equipment, another 500 million yuan will be added.</p>
<p>The budget for the Housing Rental Committee is 13 million yuan (excluding living allowances). The Tenth Group Review Committee's convener and others do not support abolishing it and propose that an arbitration group should also be added. Because abolishing the committee and distributing severance pay would not help save money. However, some councilors believe that regardless of how much expense is saved, the organizations that should be cut must be abolished. The review result was to submit the decision to the general assembly.</p>
<p>Education and culture expenses account for 19.17% of the total budget, and the request to increase it to 25% was not approved. In addition, because private schools charge excessive tuition fees, subsidies will not be increased either. The Seventh Group requested that social relief, including women's relief, be increased by 900 million yuan. The review committee believes that Shanghai is full of wounds after the war, and social relief expenses only account for 1.56% of the total budget, which is too little. The provisional decision was to include it in the budget. Because engineering costs cannot be calculated temporarily, the public works and utilities expenses will be estimated in the future. The health expenses will still be handled according to the original budget.</p>
<p>Finally, the review committee's statistics show that in addition to the actual revenue and expenditure difference of 18.7 billion yuan, another 1.5 billion yuan of new budgets was added, requiring a total of 20.2 billion yuan. The solution for covering this amount will be determined by the mayor by deliberating on the five proposed tax levies. It was decisively advocated to abolish the sanitation donation. Because the horse racing donation is not yet determined, it is not included. A 4 billion yuan surcharge on public utilities was set because levying only 10% is easy and directly benefits municipal facilities, so it was agreed to. The remaining 16.2 billion yuan will need to be levied from either the housing tax (the proposal stipulates that 18 billion yuan is to be collected) or the municipal tax (the proposal stipulates that 15 billion yuan is to be collected). Currently, aside from the preliminary resolution of the Third Review Group to levy the municipal tax, the opinions of the councilors have not converged. The decision will be submitted to the general assembly for discussion. All of the review results from yesterday will also be submitted to the general assembly for a decision. The review meeting adjourned at 9:00 PM.</p>
<h3>Today's Agenda</h3>
<p>This morning, the Municipal Council will hold its seventeenth meeting, and this afternoon, its eighteenth meeting. Both will continue to discuss proposals related to finance, industry, commerce, and the economy.</p>
<h3>Sideline Story at the Meeting</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning, some merchants and citizens distributed leaflets accusing the treacherous monk De Wu Mi Jia of Jing'an Temple. In the afternoon, Shanghai Buddhists distributed a petition declaration to the Municipal Council opposing Zhang Xiaosong of the Civil Affairs Department for violating laws.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Hotel and Business Association distributed two petitions, one requesting the cancellation of the hotel tax and the other requesting the improvement of the current salary system in the industry. The Wine and Cuisine Association also sent representatives to petition.</p>
<p>Qu Yue said, "The person who speaks last during a discussion is most likely to win. This is the secret to meetings. Please pay attention."</p>
<p>The deadline for reporting traitors was the most heated scene of yesterday's discussion. Feng Youzhen said, "If our country is still slowly dealing with traitors in one or two decades, wouldn't that be completely disgraceful?"</p>
<h3>Eight Hundred Monks Line Up to Petition; Request to Reconsider the Allocation of Temples</h3>
<p>Before the Municipal Council meeting yesterday afternoon to discuss proposals, 800 representatives of monks from various temples in the city marched in a line and went to the Municipal Council meeting hall to petition, expressing dissatisfaction with the section "allocate or borrow temples" in proposal No. 3 on civil affairs discussed by the council regarding the municipal government allocating office space for autonomous organizations. These 800 monks also designated five monks, including Fu Shan and Bai Sheng, to represent them at the meeting. When the general assembly continued at 3:00 PM yesterday afternoon, the chairman first reported the petition matters of the monks and hotel industry, and announced that the convener of the Civil Affairs Group would meet with the monks, and the Industry, Commerce, and Finance Group would meet with the hotel industry, to formulate opinions and submit them to the meeting for announcement. The monk representatives requested that the previously discussed Civil Affairs Proposal No. 3 be resubmitted for reconsideration. The receiving councilors accepted this request, and at around 4:00 PM, the 800 monks left in an orderly line.</p>
<p>According to Chen, Section Chief of the Civil Affairs Department of the Police Bureau, speaking to a reporter from Hu Guang News Agency: Regarding the proposal submitted by Director Zhang Xiaosong at the council to allocate temples as office spaces for district public offices, legally, there is a basis, because the Ministry of Interior issued the Temple and Buddhist Management Regulations several years ago, which stipulated that temples can be allocated as office spaces for public utilities when necessary, and general lewd temples and monasteries can be confiscated and nationalized. Therefore, the Buddhist petitions, etc., are purely a matter of "knowing one thing but not knowing the other."</p>
<h3>Lively Debate with Heated Arguments at the Council; Resolution to Set a Deadline for Reporting Traitors Passed; Seven Methods Decided to Request Central Government Adoption and Implementation; Supporters Dominated with Eighty Votes</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The Municipal Council held its fifteenth meeting yesterday morning to continue a heated debate on Civil Affairs Proposal No. 15, "Proposal to Request the Central Government to Thoroughly Investigate and Report Traitors within a Deadline, Punish Them According to Law, and Publicly Investigate and Try Those Who Have Been Reported or Are Already in Custody, to Uphold National Law and Appease Public Anger." The focus remained on the issue of setting a deadline. Councilors were clearly divided into two camps: supporters and opponents, with both sides engaging in heated arguments of equal intensity. The supporters even proposed revising the methods and adding additional opinions.</p>
<p>The pioneer who fired the first shot in the supporter camp was Jiang Huaishu, who, as a lawyer, explained that supporting the deadline was not to facilitate traitors but to expedite the reporting process. He said, "We fought for eight years in the Anti-Japanese War. Would we defend traitors? Since my business recovered, I have never accepted a case defending a traitor."</p>
<p>Accountant Xu Yongzuo valued the law, advocating for passing the original proposal but requiring it to go through the legislative process and not be issued by order.</p>
<p>To strengthen the effect of his speech, Feng Youzhen specially walked onto the stage and requested the chairman to give him one or two more minutes in advance. He said, "After the victory, the government was not active enough or thorough enough in handling traitor cases, so I advocate setting a deadline to speed up the process. Look at the situation in France. Major traitors such as Pétain and Laval were sentenced and prosecuted immediately after the war ended, and the remaining minor traitors were also judged and executed. China is still investigating now. What will happen if this continues indefinitely? Furthermore, many traitors often transform themselves into underground workers. If this drags on, the traitors may even receive medals." He submitted six revised methods to the assembly for discussion.</p>
<p>Wang Yansong specifically mentioned the "chaos" that Tao Baichuan spoke of last week. He said that reporting traitors is also too chaotic, and setting a deadline can stabilize people's hearts.</p>
<p>Tong Xiang supplemented Feng Youzhen's opinion, proposing that the central investigation agency assist in the reporting.</p>
<p>The Opponent Camp Begins to Speak</p>
<p>The first general in the opponent camp, He Chengfu, spoke eloquently. The bell for the time limit rang three times, but he was still not satisfied. The chairman asked him not to make irrelevant remarks and gave him another minute of grace. His opinions were more trivial, the main idea being that setting a deadline seemed to benefit traitors. The council should represent the majority of the public, otherwise, it will be criticized by "reactionaries." He said that the traitors in the Northeast have not yet been reported, and also said that Qin Hui's descendants had requested the puppet government to destroy the iron statue. Finally, he said that only traitors frame the loyal and good, not the loyal and good frame traitors.</p>
<p>Wang Liben refuted Wang Yansong's statement about stabilizing people's hearts, saying, "The common people will not be uneasy, only the traitors will be uneasy. As for whether the reporting work is expedited, it does not depend on whether there is a deadline."</p>
<p>Jia Dechao's opinion was similar to He Chengfu's, and he also believed that if the council passed the deadline for reporting, it was feared that there would be suspicion or criticism from the outside world.</p>
<p>Zhong Yuliang Speaks in a Strange Voice</p>
<p>Zhong Yuliang also came to oppose in a strange voice, but the reasons he gave were somewhat irrelevant. He divided the traitors into three types: one type is originally rich and is still a wealthy old man, one type is originally a pauper and is now a wealthy old man, and another type is originally a pauper and is still a pauper.</p>
<p>Chen Cunren also refuted the statement that setting a deadline for reporting can stabilize people's hearts. He intended to talk at length about what a traitor is, but the chairman told him that the regulations already stipulated this and there was no need to say it.</p>
<p>When announcing the end of the discussion, Gong Yuting insisted on speaking once, believing that the situation in China cannot be compared to that in France, and that traitors hiding in remote rural areas should also be reported as much as possible.</p>
<p>Finally, the chairman put the two opposing opinions of supporting the deadline and opposing the deadline to a vote. The atmosphere returned from tension to serenity, and the supporter camp won with a majority of eighty votes (124 people were present).</p>
<p>Seven Methods Discussed and Passed</p>
<p>The principle of setting a deadline was decided. The methods were then discussed in detail. Based on the six points proposed by Feng Youzhen, deleted and revised, and added two supplementary points by Tong Xiang and Lu Lushi, the final decided methods totaled seven points:</p>
<p>(1) It is proposed to request the central government to determine the deadline for reporting traitors.</p>
<p>(2) It is proposed to request the central government to announce the real names and aliases of personnel who participated in the puppet government due to underground work in the recovered areas during the period of occupation, to prevent traitors from using the excuse of doing underground work to try to exonerate themselves when they are prosecuted.</p>
<p>(3) If a reported traitor has significant evidence of guilt and fails to appear after being summoned, an arrest warrant should be issued immediately.</p>
<p>(4) Traitors who have been reported should be dealt with as soon as possible, and major traitors should not be lenient.</p>
<p>(5) Traitors who have been sentenced should be executed as soon as possible.</p>
<p>(6) Please ask the central government's agency responsible for investigating traitors to promptly announce the names of traitors who have not yet been reported and submit their crimes to the local court for reference in the investigation.</p>
<p>(7) It is proposed to request the central government to order all agencies and organizations to be responsible for reporting traitors in similar institutions during the puppet organization period and to reward people for confidential reports.</p>
<p>Two Interludes: Temporary Motions</p>
<p>After the methods were passed, there were two interludes: (1) Zhan Wenhuan had some additional opinions as a temporary motion, believing that whether supporting or opposing, the purpose was to strengthen the reporting. Therefore, he advocated that the council conduct a general reporting at the second meeting. As a result, due to time constraints, it was not discussed in the morning. (2) After a ten-minute break, when the meeting continued, Tao Baichuan suddenly requested a reconsideration of the first method, believing that this provision was too general. Legally, there is a 20-year statute of limitations for reporting criminal offenders. If the municipal government shortens the reporting deadline for traitors too much, wouldn't that be too lenient for the traitors? He advocated retaining Feng Youzhen's original proposal that was deleted during the discussion, "Military traitors, political traitors, and secret agent traitors who harm the people are not subject to the deadline," but the supporters were few and the reconsideration failed.</p>
<h3>Suggesting the Government Speedily Improve Financial Policies; Decision to Send Representatives to Petition in the Capital; Assembly Discussed Proposals Yesterday and Passed Five Temporary Motions</h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, the Council continued to discuss Finance Proposals Nos. 4 to 10 and passed five temporary motions.</p>
<p>Finance Proposal No. 4 is "Suggesting that the government speedily improve financial policies, actively handle production loans and rural loans, suppress the high interest rates of the black market, to reduce costs, stabilize prices, and relieve the difficulties of industry and commerce, to avoid economic collapse." The assembly decided to pass it, forwarding it to the municipal government for submission to the central government for speedy and practical implementation. Tao Baichuan believed that a single official document would be difficult to achieve significant results and suggested sending representatives to petition in the capital. The assembly passed this and decided to send eleven representatives. As for the selection of representatives, it was resolved that the speaker would first draft a list of names and submit it to the assembly for voting today.</p>
<p>Finance Proposal No. 5 is "To commemorate the second anniversary of the victory, it is proposed to hold an international industrial exhibition in Shanghai on September 3 next year."</p>
<p>Preventing Banks and Money Shops from Paying Out Deficient Currency</p>
<p>Finance Proposal No. 6, the reason for the case is "Please order the municipal government to instruct the Bankers Association and Money Shop Association to take effective measures to prevent banks and money shops from paying out deficient currency to avoid disputes." The review opinion was "It is proposed to request the speaker to send a letter to the commercial associations of the banking and money industries in this city to notify members to pay close attention." The assembly passed it without objection.</p>
<p>Finance Proposal No. 7, the reason for the case was revised to "Request the municipal government to forward it to the Ministry of Finance that the original regulations for restricting imported goods be strictly implemented and that the import tax for the foreign goods applied for import should be adjusted appropriately to maintain the national industry." The assembly decided to pass it in principle.</p>
<p>Factories Expedite Commencement of Work</p>
<p>Finance Proposal No. 8 is a re-submission of an old case from the Provisional Council, requesting the central government to expedite the commencement of work in the enemy and puppet factories that have been taken over and to encourage private factories to resume operations to accommodate unemployed workers and increase production. It was resolved to pass it.</p>
<p>Finance Proposal No. 9 concerns reforming the insurance system for employees of financial institutions, suggesting the adoption of a special cash guarantee system. Because the methods stipulated that colleagues related to the position should be jointly penalized after an employee's embezzlement case occurs, Qu Yue and Jiang Huaishu, etc., believed that this was inappropriate, and there were questions about the point that "a security deposit should be paid in the amount of three times the monthly salary." The assembly decided to temporarily retain this case and hand it over to the Fourth and Tenth Groups to jointly review it.</p>
<p>Finance Proposal No. 10 is to approve the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce's official letter, suggesting to the municipal government to forward the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce's petition matters to the central government for speedy implementation. The assembly decided to pass it and handle it together with Proposal No. 4.</p>
<p>Proceeds from the Sale of Enemy Property; Allocated for the Construction of Shanghai</p>
<p>Discuss five temporary motions. (1) Proposed by Jin Runxiang et al., "In order to protect workers' lives and stabilize social order, it is proposed to present it to the central government for approval to designate a national bank to hold unemployment insurance for workers' groups." Passed without objection. (2) Zhan Wenhuan proposed that the council conduct a general reporting of traitors in this city. The assembly decided to reject this, believing that there was no need for the council to set up another agency. Later, Speaker Pan proposed to make a resolution: "Notify all councilors to report traitors as quickly as possible to the best of their knowledge." The entire audience applauded and passed. (3) Proposed by Jiang Hao et al., "It is proposed to request the municipal government to give priority to employing loyal comrades of this city who have suffered hardships, to comfort loyalty." It was resolved to pass it. (4) Proposed by Jin Runxiang et al., to set a deadline for all agencies illegally occupying civilian houses to move out. It was resolved to pass it. (5) Two cases were combined. One was proposed by Jiang Huaishu et al., requesting the central government to allocate 50% of the funds from the sale of the enemy and puppet property by the Shanghai District of the Enemy and Puppet Property Management Bureau for the construction of culture and industry in this city. The proposal of Tao Baichuan et al. was to allocate 10%, but Tao ultimately endorsed the former proposal. The assembly decided to pass it. The meeting adjourned.</p>
<h3>Discussing the Thorough Investigation of Real Estate Companies; Laughs and Jokes Emerge Amidst the Tension; The Outcome of a Verbal Battle is Willingness to Retain the Case</h3>
<p>After the break, the financial proposals were discussed. The first case was proposed by Chen Gongda, suggesting a thorough investigation of the personnel organization and capital sources of various real estate companies established during the enemy and puppet period. During the discussion, "laughs and jokes emerged amidst the tension."</p>
<p>First of all, the review committee's opinion on this case was to temporarily retain it and request the original proposer to provide facts. In the assembly, Chen Gongda presented the facts, saying that as long as the Land Administration Bureau and the Social Bureau thoroughly investigated the capital of the enemy, puppet, and treacherous individuals in the real estate companies, the truth would come out. It is understood that more than 75% of the owners are no longer the owners from before the war, and he specifically cited the name of a company.</p>
<p>However, Zhang Xuelian stood up and advocated for the withdrawal of this case, believing that enemy and puppet properties already had a specialized agency to handle them, and there was no need to raise this case.</p>
<p>The chairman asked if anyone seconded the withdrawal. Jin Runxiang raised his hand to second, but Zhang Zhihan stood up and said, "I don't second it!" The chairman laughed and said, "I am asking if there is a second, and those who do not second do not need to say it." The whole audience burst into laughter.</p>
<p>After the laughter, the atmosphere returned to tension. Chen Gongda stood up with a stern expression, saying, "Does anyone advocating withdrawal have a relationship with the real estate company? If there is a relationship, they should recuse themselves." But his words did not elicit a response.</p>
<p>The chairman put the motion to withdraw to a vote, but only 37 votes were in favor, and it failed.</p>
<p>Qu Yue expressed his opinion, saying, "I personally have no relationship with real estate companies, but I do not support harassing the people."</p>
<p>Zhang Xuelian also said, "If we are to conduct a thorough investigation, it is not just real estate companies, but all companies must be investigated."</p>
<p>Many others expressed their opinions. Some opposed the principle, while others quibbled over textual revisions, and the situation was quite chaotic.</p>
<p>When the chairman decided to put the motion to reject this case to a vote, Zhang Zhihan again made the audience laugh. He said, "Hasn't the reason for the case already been passed?" The chairman said, "It has not been passed. Withdrawal is one thing, and rejection is another."</p>
<p>As a result of the vote, only 47 votes were in favor of rejection, and it did not pass. Therefore, the discussion turned to how to revise it.</p>
<p>There was much debate on how to revise it, with some people speaking several times in a row. Lu Yinchu couldn't stand it and suddenly stood up, holding the rules of procedure in one hand, and shouted loudly, "Please pay attention, according to the rules of procedure, each person may not speak more than twice!"</p>
<p>Finally, a revised proposal was finally summarized, but only a few were in favor when it was put to a vote.</p>
<p>Withdrawal, not passed. Rejection, not passed. Revision, not passed either. The chairman said with a smile: This case can only be proposed to be retained.</p>
<p>The councilors all laughed and raised their hands in the laughter to decide the fate of this case to be retained.</p>
<p>During the remaining time in the morning, two more proposals were discussed. The second case was to reclaim the power of foreign patents, such as British and French commercial power companies, water plants, and public buses, and retain it to be discussed in conjunction with the proposals of the Fifth Group. The third case was revised to plan for the construction of civilian shopping centers in each district and to re-designate stall areas to rectify the city's appearance. The assembly decided to pass it in principle and send it to the municipal government for forwarding to the Ministry of Economic Affairs for handling.</p>

<h3>盆湯弄橋梅閘橋　工務局招標承修</h3>
<p>The Public Works Bureau招标 for repairs to Péntāngnòng Bridge and Méizhág Bridge.</p>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] To improve traffic in the central district, the relevant bureaus have repeatedly consulted and reviewed the implementation plan, and the situation is gradually improving. However, there are still several points that the reporter learned from the person in charge of the Public Utilities Bureau, as follows: (1) The penalties in the "Implementation Measures for Improving Traffic in the Central District" are only applicable to the central district. Other districts will still be handled in accordance with the management regulations for various vehicles. (2) For those who do not park in accordance with the regulations, the police will record the license number and report it to the branch bureau, which will notify the violator of the penalty. The license will no longer be confiscated. (3) The ban on freight trucks on Beijing East Road does not apply to private passenger cars and motorized delivery vans that are not carrying goods. In order to facilitate north-south traffic on the Suzhou Creek and reduce vehicle congestion on other bridges, it is necessary to open the Péntāngnòng Bridge and Lǎozhá Bridge. The Public Works Bureau will solicit bids for repairs, which will be completed in February, and then they can be officially opened to traffic. As for the plan to convert Míng Yuan Road and Yuánmíngyuán Road into one-way traffic, and how to improve the surface of the Waibaidu Bridge, the Public Works Bureau will conduct a detailed study before making a decision.</p>

<p>A Clean-Up Team Transfers the Case to the Court for Investigation: Suspicions of Collusion and Malpractice Found in the Municipal Government's Acceptance of Vehicle Repairs</p>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] Regarding the suspected malpractice in the Municipal Government's General Affairs Department's acceptance of enemy and puppet vehicles, after an investigation by the Clean-Up Team, it was believed that the personnel handling the matter in the Municipal Government colluded with the Wàntài Repair Factory in fraudulent activities. The Clean-Up Team resolved at its eighth meeting to transfer all case files to the District Court Prosecutor's Office this morning for handling in accordance with the law. The complete set of documents includes (1) the General Report of the Shanghai Municipal Government on Receiving and Handling Enemy and Puppet Materials, and the report form related to vehicles in the Report on Receiving Enemy and Puppet Vehicle Oil and Parts, a total of six documents; (2) a signed report from Shī Bāngruì, Director of the General Affairs Department, one document; (3) a contract between the Shanghai Municipal Government and the Wàntài Repair Factory, one document; (4) an investigation report from the Clean-Up Team, one document.</p>

<h3>管理汽車加油站　市政會議通過辦法</h3>
<p>Municipal Conference Approves Measures for Managing Automobile Gas Stations</p>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] The measures for the management of automobile gas stations (including attached air pumping stations) in this city have been approved at the last municipal conference. The main rules are as follows: (1) Automobile gas stations shall not be set up on sidewalks on both sides of roads. (2) For the construction of automobile gas stations on private land, a detailed address layout map must first be drawn, and a registration form must be filled out. The form must be reviewed and approved by the Public Works Bureau, the Land Administration Bureau, and the Police Bureau. After approval, a construction permit will be issued by the Public Works Bureau. A permit fee must be paid when obtaining the permit, and the permit is valid for one year. (3) Each gasoline pump and air pump should be equipped with a light, and marked with words such as "Danger" and "No Smoking". (4) The Public Utilities Bureau may send personnel to inspect automobile gas stations at any time. (5) Automobile gas stations for private use shall not sell or transfer gasoline to others. The quality and quantity of gasoline sold by commercial automobile gas stations must meet the standards, and there must be no malpractices such as adulterating inferior oil or shortchanging quantities. (6) If the Public Utilities Bureau, the Public Works Bureau, the Land Administration Bureau, and the Police Bureau deem it necessary to relocate existing automobile gas stations, the Public Utilities Bureau may order them to relocate, and all expenses shall be borne by the station owner. (7) The automobile gas station permit must be hung in a prominent position inside the station for inspection. (8) Automobile gas stations that violate the rules will be subject to penalties based on the severity of the violation. (9) Any of the following circumstances may result in the revocation of the permit: private automobile gas stations engaging in private business or transferring to others; commercial automobile gas stations selling gasoline that is inferior to the oil sample submitted; commercial automobile gas stations found to have stolen or other fraudulent acts in the quantity of gasoline sold. (10) Those who are subject to the penalty of revocation of the permit shall completely dismantle the gas station and all attached buildings within a limited period.

<h3>沿蘇州河黃浦江　全部潮門已修竣</h3>
<p>All Tidal Gates Along the Suzhou Creek and Huangpu River Have Been Repaired</p>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] The terrain of this city is low-lying. During high tides, the tide water flows back into the ditches, and lower road surfaces, such as the intersection of Sichuan Road and Jiujiang Road, the section of Guangdong Road from Jiangxi Road to Sichuan Road, and the area near Risheng Building, are often flooded during heavy rains. In the past, the Public Concession established tidal gates at the outlets of various ditches to prevent tidal water from flowing back, but they have become ineffective due to years of disrepair. Now, the Public Works Bureau has repaired all the tidal gates along both banks of the Suzhou Creek and the Huangpu River from Hongkou Creek to the coast of Zhengzheng Road, as well as the western part of Hongkou Creek, for a total of one hundred and sixty-four tidal gates. The first phase of the project was completed at the end of August. Within the scope of the effectiveness of the rebuilt tidal gates in the first phase, there is no more water accumulation on the low-lying roads. However, at the culvert outlet of the tidal gate north of the Laji Bridge on Zhejiang Road, after the tidal gate is closed, the tidal water cannot flow in, so it overflows from the well and floods the road surface. The Public Works Bureau plans to build another tidal gate at the Suzhou Creek outlet to prevent this. Also, the section of Suzhou Road and North Suzhou Road west of Zhejiang Road has banks that are too low, and the water overflows the top of the bank during high tides. Therefore, it is necessary to raise the road surface or the banks, but due to the large scale of the project and limited funding, it is feared that construction will be difficult at present. As for Julu Road, Maoming South Road, Changle Road, and Shaanxi South Road in the former French Concession, there is still a phenomenon of tidal water flowing back, which is caused by the Zhaojiabang River. The Public Works Bureau is currently building a gate dam and pumping station at the Rihui port of Zhaojiabang River, and has begun to build a tidal gate project at the junction of the former French Concession and the South City. After the completion of the above projects, the phenomenon of water accumulation in this city can be greatly improved.</p>

<h3>地院遷法營房　市長尤爲設法</h3>
<p>The Mayor is Making Every Effort to Move the District Court to the French Barracks</p>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] After the war, the Shanghai District Court has been working with the High Court in the same building on North Zhejiang Road. The address is small, and the affairs are extremely busy. Even the courtrooms are not enough. There has long been a discussion about moving out. It was recently rumored that the Municipal Government has agreed to find a way to give the French military barracks on Lǐlù Road to the court, but it has not been realized due to some property disputes. According to news from the District Court, Mayor Wú is extremely busy because the Municipal Council is currently in session, so he has expressed that after the Municipal Council closes, he will definitely work hard for the District Court, and even if he cannot "allocate" it, he must at least enable the District Court to "lease" the site to meet urgent needs. It is said that Xiè, the Minister of the Judicial Administration Department, is also very concerned about this matter and is eager to find a solution as soon as possible. Therefore, the District Court's move is almost inevitable. The new site is closer to the District Prosecutor's Office and the detention center, which can also be much more convenient for work.</p>

<h3>輪船業招待軍警當局　商碼頭治安辦法　宣鐵吾表示決取締惡劣風氣　嚴密防止盜竊物資非法組織</h3>
<p>The Shipping Industry Hosted Military and Police Authorities to Discuss Security Measures for Docks. Xuan Tiewu stated that he is determined to eliminate the bad atmosphere and strictly prevent the theft of materials and illegal organizations.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Shipping Industry Association, in order to thoroughly eradicate theft at ports and docks, hosted the responsible persons of the military and police authorities of this city at the International Hotel yesterday afternoon to discuss security measures for Shanghai's waterway docks and warehouses. Xuan Tiewu, Xu Xueyu, Yu Shuping, Zhang Jinzhi, Tao Yishan, and others attended, as well as more than 50 representatives from various shipping companies. The meeting was chaired by Yang Guanbei. After the meeting, the chairman first reported: I hope that the phenomenon of theft in docks and warehouses can be completely eradicated in the future. Then Commander Xuan gave a speech, stating in brief: At present, the police bureau has drafted two measures to eliminate this bad atmosphere: (1) Strictly prevent organizations such as the "Thirty-Six Gang," the "Scalper Gang," and illegal organizations engaged in stealing materials, such as the so-called "Patrolman Company" and "Insurance Company," to eliminate theft. (2) When barges transport materials, they should pay close attention to order to avoid petty criminals from taking the opportunity to act. As for the Municipal Government, in order to improve the bad atmosphere of Shanghai's ports, it has recently organized a "Port Management Committee." Its organization can be divided into three departments: (1) the administrative department, which is responsible for problems such as the repair and reconstruction of warehouses and docks, is responsible by the Public Utilities Bureau; (2) the organization of dock stevedores is managed by the Social Affairs Bureau; (3) the order of ports and docks is maintained by the Municipal Police Bureau. Each agency has taken up its duties and is stepping up rectification. The waterway security problem will be turned around soon. Later, Xu Xueyu, on behalf of the shipping industry, presented a banner to Commander Xuan to express his respect.</p>
<h3>恢復港口秩序　呈請劃分警權</h3>
<p>Restore Port Order, Request for Division of Police Power</p>
<p>The association telegraphed President Song, Minister Yu, and Mayor Wu yesterday, respectively, requesting a division of waterway police power in order to improve port order. The original telegram is as follows: "President Song of the Executive Yuan, Minister Yu of the Ministry of Communications, and Mayor Wu of Shanghai: Since the restoration, theft on the Huangpu River in Shanghai has been rampant, and dock order has also been chaotic. The key to resolving the problem is that the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau and the Jianghai Customs Port Police Department have failed to reasonably divide their powers and responsibilities, forming a special area where neither party is responsible, leading to many abuses. This association is deeply anxious about the Shanghai crisis. We dare to presume to request Your Excellencies to clearly stipulate the scope of the Jianghai Customs Port Police Department's authority. All responsibilities for land and water security within the Shanghai urban area should be borne by the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau in order to unify authority and eliminate theft. The reputation of the Port of Shanghai depends on this. We sincerely suggest that you approve and respond. President Du Yong of the full title is respectfully."</p>

<h3>敵偽時期一「紅人」　潘三省判七年　高院傳訊謝葆生妻　因有隱匿產罪嫌</h3>
<p>A "Big Shot" During the Enemy-Puppet Period, Pān Sānxǐng, Sentenced to Seven Years; High Court Summons Xie Baosheng's Wife for Concealing Assets</p>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] Pān Sānxǐng, a "big shot" in Shanghai during the enemy-puppet period who organized the puppet Gold Exchange Association, the puppet Lianyi Bank, the puppet Football Federation, the Asian General Assembly, the Chinese General Assembly, and the Zhaofeng Club, was sentenced to seven years of imprisonment by the High Court yesterday, deprived of public rights for seven years, and all of his property was confiscated except for a discretionary amount to leave necessary living expenses for his family.</p>
<p>The High Court also concluded the cases of suspected traitors Eitobron and Zhu Changsheng, Wei Shanfu, etc., who were military commentators and intelligence officers for the German Embassy's XGRS radio station. The sentences are scheduled to be pronounced on the morning of the 26th of this month. Xie Baosheng, a "gangster" who opened the Xianshali Dance Palace, Kader Bathhouse, and Xinzha Hotel in this city, was arrested after the victory and has been sentenced to two and a half years by the High Court for having served as the Deputy Director of the Jiangsu Provincial Police Department during the enemy-puppet period. Now his wife, Xie Zhu, and others are suspected of concealing property, and have been prosecuted by the High Prosecutor's Office in accordance with Articles 28 and 29 of the Criminal Law and Article 12 of the Regulations on Punishing Traitors. They were tried in the High Court yesterday afternoon.</p>
<p>It is reported that after Xie Baosheng was detained by the Military Intelligence Bureau, Xie Zhu, fearing the confiscation of his property, telephoned Wang Chaoliang, the manager of Xie's Xinzha Hotel, in October of last year, asking him to transfer the movable property, such as redwood furniture, from Xie's residence on Weihaiwei Road and Changping Road to the home of Dai Buxiang, the manager of the Grand China Hotel, his children's in-laws, for storage. The next day, Dai learned of the matter and, fearing accidents, ordered it to be moved out. Xie Zhu and others then moved the property to a rented house on Rue Massenet and concealed it, but it was discovered by the responsible authorities, sealed up, and prosecuted by the High Prosecutor's Office on suspicion of concealing rebel property. Yesterday, the defendants were summoned to court for questioning. Xie Zhu claimed that the property was her personal property. Xie's eldest son, Xie Wenyuan (at large), had served as the captain of the Jiangsu Provincial Security Command and the puppet Yangzhou Taxation Bureau. The High Court asked his mother about his whereabouts yesterday. Xie Zhu said that he often went out to do business, and the details of his puppet positions were unknown. She did not know where he was now. The court adjourned the case for a retrial.</p>
<p>In addition, the cases of suspected traitors Bu Jixiang, Ren Yongkang, Xu Senfu, and others were investigated once yesterday and were adjourned for a retrial.</p>

<h3>美記者被控案　地院曾向司法行政部請示　開庭調查並非即表示受理</h3>
<p>American Reporter Accused: District Court Consulted the Judicial Administration Department; Opening an Investigation Does Not Necessarily Mean Acceptance</p>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] The German, Shen Ke, is suspected of participating in the Nazi international spy organization, the Ohad Bureau, and has been arrested by the US military, as reported in this newspaper. After learning of this news, Randal, a reporter for the Associated Press of America, reported it in detail. Unexpectedly, Shen Ke believed that Randal had deliberately slandered him and filed a lawsuit with the District Court. Randal immediately stated that the Chinese court should not accept the lawsuit of a person with the suspicion of war crimes from an enemy country and asked the court to dismiss the case. All sectors of the city are paying close attention to the legal issues of this case, and reporters are also concerned about the future of this case and its great impact on reporting news in the future. According to the person in charge of a judicial organ in this city, the opening of an investigation by the court does not necessarily mean that it has been accepted. Our country is still in a state of war with Germany, so there are indeed legal problems in this case. The District Court had already conducted a thorough study of the case and consulted the Judicial Administration Department, but has not yet received a reply.</p>

<h3>Powell Cancels Trip to Shanghai; Suddenly Suffers Heart Attack in Japan; Will Return to the US on a Hospital Ship</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] J.B. Powell, the former editor of the "China Weekly Review," an English-language journal in this city, was one of the most vehement critics of the enemy and puppet regime in the past. Ding Mocun, Li Shiqun, and others hated him to the bone, and once sent thugs to throw a bomb at him. Unexpectedly, the bomb slipped over his shoulder, fell to the ground, and did not explode. After the outbreak of the war, he was imprisoned by the enemy's military police at the New Asia Hotel and suffered severe mistreatment, with one leg eventually becoming disabled due to frostbite. Recently, he went to Japan at the invitation of the Tokyo International Military Tribunal to testify. Powell was eager to see China after its victory and meet with his old friends whom he had not seen for many years. He originally planned to visit China after completing his testimony. Unexpectedly, although his health was still good before leaving Japan, he suddenly suffered a severe heart attack after several testimonies. Doctors advised him to return to the US immediately for treatment, so the trip to China had to be cancelled. Powell has now decided to follow the doctor's advice and return to the US on a hospital ship. His son, J.W. Powell, who is currently editing the "China Weekly Review" in Shanghai, has decided to fly to Japan today to meet with his father.</p>

<h3>Female Corpse Found in Soil Well with Trousers Wrapped Around Neck Five Times; Young Woman Murdered; Paramour Flees Without a Trace; Cause No More Than Love Triangle</h3>
<p>Small Shoemaker's Cry Causes Commotion Among Residents of Yinghua Lane</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Wang Shouzhen, 33 years old, from Suqian, worked as a boiler attendant in the tiger stove run by Wu Wangshi in Yaoshui Lane, Xiaoshadu Road, seven years ago. At that time, he met a woman from Changshu named Xiaoman, 23 years old, and they began living together. Later, they moved back to their hometown. Three years later, they returned to Shanghai, but Wang could not find a business and his finances were tight. Wang Shouzhen then went to work for the puppet security team in Changshu with a fellow villager (name unknown). After the victory, Wang brought Xiaoman back to Shanghai and had her stay at the home of his fellow villager, Wu Wangshi (3883 Daxu Lane, Changshou Road). Xiaoman now works as a female worker in the 13th Textile Factory. Wang himself went to Hangzhou to work, but because his income was still insufficient, he returned to Shanghai on the 17th of this month and stayed at Wu Wangshi's place for one night. The next day, at 3:00 PM, Wang accompanied Xiaoman to the home of his fellow villager, Hu Zhiren, at 1780 Yinghua Lane, Robert Sheng Road. Hu is a worker at the China Textile Company. Wang mentioned that the cost of living in Shanghai was high and difficult to maintain, and he planned to return to Suqian with his family. That night, Wang and Xiaoman stayed in a small room outside the back door of Hu's house. (Note: This lane is a dead end). To everyone's surprise, at around 6:30 AM yesterday morning, Bao Genbao (16 years old), a leather shoe apprentice from Yangzhou in the same lane, went to a soil well in the lane to draw water and suddenly saw two feet pointing upwards in the well. He shouted loudly, and soon the residents of the lane gathered and tried to retrieve the body. It was a young woman with a five-foot-long waistband wrapped around her neck five times. She had short hair, wore a sweat vest inside, white shorts, a short red-striped shirt, and gauze socks. Her nails were painted red. Later, Hu Zhiren identified the deceased as Xiaoman and, together with the Baojia, reported it to the Putuo Road Branch. Chief Qi of the branch ordered Deputy Chief Teng Yongxi, along with Judicial Section Chief Ying Zhensan and police officers Zhang Xiaolin and Zhao Yongji, to rush to the scene for investigation. Wang Shouzhen had already fled without a trace. A pair of Xiaoman's red cloth shoes were found outside the nearby wall. After the body was photographed, because there were no family members, the Pushan Villa was notified to collect it for burial. After receiving a report from his subordinates, Chief Qi of the branch, because the case involved a death, prepared a document overnight ordering police officers Zhang Xiaolin and Zhao Yongji to rush to Changshu to investigate the deceased's family and arrest the murderer for investigation. According to the investigating police officer, Xiaoman had been working in Shanghai for several months and may have had a lover, so she was unwilling to return to Suqian with Wang Shouzhen. Wang, in a moment of anger, killed the woman and threw her into the well. It was also found that the murderer, Wang Shouzhen, is five feet seven inches tall, with a rectangular face, and his hair is combed back. He wears a blue striped shirt and pants, and black cloth shoes.</p>

<h3>SS Tjilata of Java China Japan Lijn Refuses Passengers to Xiamen</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Yesterday, there were originally eight foreign ships scheduled to arrive in Shanghai, but only the SS Scheldersveld of Java China Japan Lijn, the SS Promethues of Jardine Matheson, and the SS Siam of Blue Funnel Line, and Yu Wan Ni arrived. The others were not seen. According to the United States President Lines, the SS President Jefferson is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai this morning, and the SS Hastings of Wa Lun &amp; Co. has been postponed to tomorrow. The SS Tjilata of Java China Japan Lijn, which came from Java this time, encountered a storm on the way in the South Seas and only left Hong Kong yesterday afternoon. It is expected to arrive in Shanghai on the 22nd. The SS Soemba of Soon Heng Line has also been postponed to the 24th. The SS Tjilata is scheduled to leave Shanghai on the 24th to return to Batavia, following the original route via Xiamen, Hong Kong, Singapore, and other ports. In order to respect China's navigation rights, although it must dock at Xiamen on the way back, it refuses to carry passengers and cargo to Xiamen. According to the company, several agencies have applied to carry passengers, but they have been politely refused.</p>
<h3>Relief Goods Distributes Flour; Reaches All Four Suburbs of Shanghai</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] This spring, the Shanghai branch of Relief Goods organized a work team to go to the city's fourteen suburban areas to conduct surveys and provide relief. Over the past few months, from Huangpu to Pudong Lixing in the east, to Zhuzhai Jiangqiao in the west, to Gaoqiao Wusong in the north, and to Cuizhuang Yangsi in the south, the emergency relief flour has now been distributed. A total of 13,221 bags of flour were distributed, providing relief to 16,521 extremely poor people, of whom 40% were young children, 30% were elderly and weak, and the other 30% were orphans, disabled, sick, and unemployed. The list of these poor people was reviewed by the district offices and then actually investigated by Relief Goods. The distribution was then carried out jointly by the district offices, gentry, and Baojia heads. Each adult received one bag of flour, and each child received half a bag. The office will soon distribute old clothes and skim milk powder.</p>
<h3>Mao Yisheng Discusses Construction of the Pudong Bridge; Difficulty in Raising Funds; Tunnel-Style Project is Huge; Will Take About Three Years to Complete</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The reporter recently interviewed Mao Yisheng, the head of the Engineering Planning Group of the Executive Yuan, to inquire about the construction of the Pudong Bridge, which was strongly advocated by the councilors at the Municipal Council meeting, and other related issues. According to Fang, one of the most difficult aspects of building this bridge at present is how to raise funds. After the bridge is completed, the bridge itself will be able to generate income, and the construction costs can be gradually repaid. In foreign countries, the cost of building a bridge is never borne by the government. In terms of engineering, because there are many ships entering and leaving the Huangpu River, the tunnel type is more suitable. However, this type of tunnel project is more extensive and will take about three years to complete.</p>
<p>Secretary Liang of the Planning Group States That Tanggu, Qingdao, and Shanghai Ports Should Be Built First</p>
<p>According to Liang Bogao, the chief secretary of the group, the group has completed its inspection of railways and highways south of the Great Wall, except for the communist areas. In terms of seaports, the group has inspected all ports along the coast from Huludao in the north to Hainan Island in the south, except for Dalian, Weihaiwei, and Yantai, and has prepared reports and submitted them to the Executive Yuan. The group believes that the ports that should be built first are Tanggu, Qingdao, and Shanghai, followed by Qinhuangdao, Huludao, etc. The opening of a new port in Guangzhou Bay is also a goal that the group values.</p>
<p>Railway Repair; Change of Plan; Restoration to Begin in Areas with Good Security</p>
<p>In terms of railways, the damage in South and Central China is more severe than in North China. The railways in North China suffered very little damage at the time of the victory and were originally scheduled to be repaired first. However, after the victory, the communist army harassed and destroyed transportation everywhere, and there was no guarantee of security, so the plan has now been changed to begin restoring the railways in areas with good security. The Zhe-Gan Railway has been damaged by more than 90%. The Pingxiang-Zhuzhou section and the Zhuji-Jinhua section have already started construction and are planned to be repaired first. The group has also designed a third north-south trunk line in addition to the Ping-Han, Yue-Han, and Jin-Pu lines, from Lanzhou, via Chengdu, Chongqing, using the Xiang-Gui-Qian Railway to Liuzhou, and extending to Guangzhou Bay. As for highways, the transportation capacity is poor. Given the current national economic difficulties and the fact that the old railways have not yet been repaired, they can only maintain the status quo and wait for future development.</p>

<h3>Letter to the Editor</h3>
<p>To the Editor,</p>
<p>We are writing to you on behalf of our client, China IYi Feng Company, regarding a news item titled "New Guang Theater Accuses Ticket Recipient of Being a Thief" published in the Shen Bao on September 16. According to the article, the so-called cotton cloth merchant Huang Juren claimed that the earpiece fell off and there was no sound. However, all the earpiece plugs of our company are equipped with spring locks that cannot be opened without a key. Unless the lock spring is forcibly broken, it is impossible for them to fall off on their own. A trial listening session on the spot revealed that the earpiece was clear and undamaged. His statement is obviously untrue. Furthermore, if he did not want to listen, why did he place it on his lap and cover it with his bag, making his suspicion even more obvious. Our company's earpieces have been stolen many times, so we had no choice but to report the case according to regulations. Moreover, because the person was well-dressed, we did not want to pursue the matter further. The news report is quite inconsistent with the truth and may cause misunderstandings among theatergoers. We request that you correct the report on our behalf. We respectfully request that you review this letter and publish it.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Lawyer Gu Kenfu</p>
<p>Regarding the article "Yutong Manufacturing Company Manager Defrauds" published in your newspaper on September 14, which states that the manager "owns a building at No. 24 Zhianfang, North Sichuan Road," this is completely inconsistent with the facts. The house was jointly rented by myself and Mr. Lin from Gonghe Real Estate Company (a lease is available for verification). Later, because my family had not yet arrived, the house was entirely entrusted to Mr. Lin's family for care. Afterwards, Mr. Lin lent it to a Mr. Hu for temporary residence. Last month, my family came to Shanghai and moved into the house. We are currently urging Mr. Hu to move out one room of the borrowed building as soon as possible. The fraud manager Wu Gengxin was arrested in the house, presumably residing in Mr. Hu's room. This matter concerns my rights and interests, and I am truly afraid of misunderstandings. Therefore, I am writing to request a correction. Yang Fangshi</p>

<h3>Science News; US Uses Vibration Meter to Measure Elephant Steps; And Invents Electric Weed Killer</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 19th] News from the China Society of Natural Sciences: (1) Although elephants are large, their steps are very light. Recently, the US General Electric Company used a vibration meter to measure the vibration frequency of elephant steps as three mils per second and the vibration frequency of lion steps as twelve mils per second. (2) Mr. Gibbs of the United States recently invented an electric weed killer that looks like a plow rake, with copper electrodes as rake teeth that conduct high-voltage, low-current electricity. The machine is towed by a jeep. Where it passes, the weeds are electrocuted, and all are burned to death from the leaves to the roots, making them unable to regenerate. Using this method to kill weeds costs ten US dollars per acre. However, the yield of American agriculture and the value of land can reduce losses of 500 million US dollars per year.</p>

It has now been decided to open classes at No. 221 and No. 222 Ouyang Road. However, the problems of teachers' and students' dormitories cannot be solved. The repair of the old site on Daxilu Road is also limited by funding and may be difficult to complete in the short term. However, it can only be repaired in stages. Regarding the treatment of professors, due to financial constraints, it cannot be compared with national universities, but efforts have been made to adjust it and increase it by 50% of the original quota. The famous historian Qian Mu originally agreed to teach, but later did not take the position due to some reasons. Famous professors Lu Cheng Zhi and Jiang Zhu Zhuang, who originally taught at the school, will continue to teach next semester. As for the school's books and instruments, efforts will be made to replenish them.</p>

Attendees included Director Zhang of the Civil Affairs Bureau, Sun Jialiang, Zhang Baokui, Zhu Liangchun of the Police Bureau, and district chiefs from various districts, totaling over thirty people. The discussion resulted in a decision that, starting today (the 20th), personnel from the Military Police Corps and the Police Bureau will be dispatched, in conjunction with household registration personnel from various districts, carrying investigation forms, to conduct investigations in various districts.</p>
<h3>District Offices Must Fully Mobilize for Household Reregistration and Record Transcription</h3>
<p>The Municipal Civil Affairs Bureau yesterday sent letters to the district offices stating that the initial household registration is the basic work for implementing the Household Registration Law, and future household administration in this city will be based on this. Therefore, all efforts must be made for the household reregistration and record transcription in various districts. It is stipulated that district offices should have at least half of the assistant staff participate in the household administration work during the household reregistration, record transcription, and household statistics period. Other staff should also be concentrated and used to assist in household administration work at any time. After the initial household registration is completed, this bureau will conduct a strict assessment based on (1) whether the household reregistration work is accurate and without error; (2) whether the record transcription work and data compilation are serious and prompt; and (3) whether the district office personnel are fully mobilized. This will be an important criterion for evaluating district chiefs and deputy district chiefs.</p>

<h3>Ministry of Finance Explains: No Limit on Overdraft Amount, No Need for Mandatory Guarantees; Instructs Banking Industry to Understand Original Intent of Laws</h3>
<p>[Our Reporter] The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, along with the guilds of towel blankets, inner cotton weaving, hand-made cotton weaving, sock machines, dyeing, handkerchief weaving, and general merchandise businesses, jointly requested the Ministry of Finance to retract the order requiring contracts and limits for overdraft accounts with banks. The request was telegraphed to the Ministry of Finance for review. The Ministry of Finance responded with a telegram stating: The Ministry's recently issued Measures for the Administration of Banks stipulate that the use of commercial bank funds should primarily target lending to agricultural, industrial, and mining production, the transport and sale of essential daily necessities, and the transport and sale of foreign trade products. It has also been stipulated that banks should enter into contracts in advance for the aforementioned loans, whether in the form of loans or overdrafts. This demonstrates the Ministry's emphasis on assisting industrial and commercial production. The requirement to enter into contracts for overdrafts is intended to improve the soundness of banking operations and to facilitate auditing, and does not imply any restriction on the amount of overdrafts. Moreover, overdrafts are contractual by nature. The Ministry's order to enter into contracts is merely a change from oral contracts to written contracts, which should not pose any difficulty. As for the previous limit of 5 million yuan for each overdraft account, that was a restriction imposed during the early stages of the War of Resistance Against Japan. Since the amendment to the Temporary Measures for the Administration of Banks in Extraordinary Times in December of the 30th year of the Republic [1941], and the promulgation of the Measures for the Administration of Bank Mortgage and Credit Loans, this limit has been abolished. Furthermore, since the promulgation of the Ministry of Finance's Measures for the Administration of Banks in April of this year, the previously promulgated Measures for the Administration of Bank Mortgage and Credit Loans have also been repealed. There is no limit on the amount of overdrafts for industry and commerce from banks, nor is there any requirement for mandatory guarantees. The points mentioned in the telegram are largely misunderstandings. The Ministry previously received a petition from the Shanghai Banking Association in July of this year, stating that Shanghai banks have always entered into contracts for loans that are pledged or fixed-term. However, there have traditionally been no contracts for overdrafts. Now that they are required to enter into contracts for all overdrafts, the clients are not fully aware of the details and still need to be contacted and explained. The petition requested that the measure be implemented uniformly from September 1st of this year. The Ministry has verified that the claim is indeed true and has approved the request. However, they must strictly comply with the regulations in the future and must not disregard the instructions. The Shanghai Banking Association has been re-telegraphed to forward the instructions to all member banks to understand the original intent of the laws and handle the matter properly, without any misunderstanding or negligence. The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce should inform the relevant guilds accordingly to handle the matter appropriately.</p>
<h3>Strong Demand for US Dollars, Gold Prices Also Boosted</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai gold market initially experienced fatigue and then declined, but the buying force from US dollars stimulated sentiment, leading to this outcome.

In a state of scarcity, prices were raised sharply, and after breaking through the 3400 yuan mark, various speculative buying motives arose, and the competition to buy intensified, reaching 3480 yuan before a slight pullback. The closing price was 70 yuan higher than the previous close. Hong Kong dollars were also boosted, closing 10 yuan higher than before. The Hong Kong exchange rate was stable in the morning but strengthened in the afternoon, around 710 yuan. Indian exchange was above 850 yuan, British exchange was between 11,300 yuan and 11,500 yuan.

<h3>Sparse Bond Market Trading</h3>

<h3>Chongqing Yarn Industry Plans to Organize Exchange</h3>
<p>[Chongqing, 18th] Both buyers and sellers in this city's cotton yarn market are individually responsible, which inevitably leads to various problems.

They have also submitted a request to the Ministry of Economic Affairs for approval and filing. Before the exchange is established, group trading will be adopted to impose restrictions.</p>
<h3>Grain Transit Measures: Shanghai Continues to Apply, Extended to the End of October</h3>

According to the Social Affairs Bureau yesterday, the main points of the grain transit measures in this city are as follows: (1) Grain merchants engaged in transit trade should purchase from the producing areas and not purchase from the market. (2) When purchasing in the producing areas, grain merchants should first report the purchasing location, quantity, and sales destination to the Ministry of Food for approval and issuance of a certificate. This certificate should be presented to the Customs for verification during transportation. (3) When imported foreign rice is declared for transit, the Customs will verify and release it.</p>
<h3>Cotton Textile Company Allocation Prices Remain Unchanged from Last Period; Rayon Begins to Fall Yesterday, Down 200,000 Yuan from the Previous Day</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the opening price of rayon was still quite firm. The No. 120 Tianqiao light-colored product was priced at 3.4 million yuan. Later, because the Cotton Textile Company listed allocation to silk weaving factories with the same prices as last period, and some hoarders were selling off large quantities on the market at high prices, sentiment weakened and buying became thin. The lowest price fell to 145,000 yuan. In the morning, trading closed at 180,000 yuan. In the afternoon, actual sales absorbed some at lower prices, and the market rebounded to 225,000 yuan.

Silk fabrics were generally firm. Huajin crepe had some buying sentiment yesterday, raising 150 yuan.</p>
<h3>Recent Transaction Price of Raw Silk: US$7.25</h3>
<p>It is reported that with abundant Japanese silk inventories in the United States, most manufacturers believe that silk prices still have a downward trend, resulting in weakened buying sentiment. The US government stipulated last week that the minimum price for Japanese D-grade silk cannot be lower than 6.25 US dollars. Therefore, Shanghai silk prices have been relatively stable in recent days. On the 18th, China Silk sold over 20 bales of raw silk to an American firm, priced at 7.25 to 7.50 US dollars, approximately one US dollar higher than the US minimum price.</p>
<h3>Rice Market Turns from Fatigue to Firm, Flour and Wheat Continue to Rise</h3>

However, white yuan rice remained stable. Total registration of inbound goods amounted to over 12,000 piculs. Flour sales were active. Factories announced that supply could not meet demand, and prices continued to rise by 100-200 yuan. Wheat bran remained stable. Both Min and Guang wheat had buying sentiment, and Shantou also inquired, pushing prices up by 300-500 yuan. White wheat trends were unremarkable due to inactivity in the north. Soybean arrivals were continuous, and high-quality Nanyang beans were slightly taken, market conditions were showing an upward trend, rising 500-600 yuan. However, secondary quality beans still lacked transactions. Broad beans had brisk retail sales on the street, continuing to rise by 1000 yuan. Arrivals from Zhongguan were also scarce, so they could not withstand sales, and prices rose by over 1000 yuan. Shelled peanuts continued to be processed in Nanyang. There were fewer shipments due to cloudy weather, going up 1000-2000 yuan. Mung beans were faint, Canadian peas came back a little 1000-2000 yuan, corn was extremely sluggish, down a little more 1000 yuan or so.

Yongxing retreated to the previous closing price. As American Asia approached the previous closing price, off-floor short coverings came forward to cover. Gradually stabilized in the quiet, so the on-floor intention suddenly became stronger, and the two major hot stocks once surged in a counter movement, near noon, a little firm, but near closing, those with floating profits were eager to close out, and no one was behind, so stocks returned in a short time and approached the lowest price to end. In the stock group, in addition to China-America Enamelware, which traded 5,000 shares at 75 after closing, the rest generally revealed a sluggish momentum. Trading in the trading floor was light, and within half an hour after the morning opening, it was quiet. In addition to American Asia and New Light, which were crowded with people in front of the counter, even Yongxing, which has always considered itself the leading star, was lonely.

The total number of applications was 16,150 bags, including 15,850 bags of medium white sugar and 300 bags of raw red sugar, accounting for 181 units. Except for sugar, confectionery, and tea food businesses applying for less than 20 bags, the rest were all sugar merchants.</p>
<h3>Cigarette Industry Petitions for Collection of Taxes at 60% of the Tax Amount</h3>
<p>The local cigarette industry is suffering from the pressure of imported cigarettes and heavy taxes. At the same time, due to political instability, traffic obstructions, and declining sales, as well as the rising cost of labor and endless exploitation by high-interest loans, the entire industry has entered a major crisis. After an emergency meeting of the association's directors and supervisors, it was decided to send representatives Dai Gengxin, Pan Mingxin, Bao Gengsheng, Ke Renshi, Jing Shuping, and Yao Shushen to petition President Song and the Shanghai Goods Tax Bureau today for relief. If this is unsuccessful, it is reported that next Monday, all directors and supervisors will represent the city's 80-plus cigarette factories in going to Beijing to petition the relevant ministries and departments of the central government, urging the government to pay attention. It is reported that the purpose of the association's petition is to request that, starting from October 1, taxes be collected at a reduced rate of 60% of the tax amount. At the same time, they are also requesting the improvement of the accounting and payment methods in order to alleviate the emergency and cultivate tax revenue.</p>
<h3>Yarn Sales Become More Active; Market Prices Rise by 30,000 to 50,000; Gray Fabric Prices Surge by 5,000 to 6,000</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Yesterday, the yarn market appeared even more robust. Transactions in medium and small-sized yarns were quite lively. Merchants from Jing, Han, Xiang, Gan, and other regions showed considerable interest, and morale was exceptionally high. Yarns produced by the Fangjian mill, such as Wei Ma, Lan Feng, Shui Yue, and Ri Guang brands, were particularly popular. This was because pure weaving factories were selecting raw materials, specifying these brands, with a sense of "no other will do." Overall, apart from the special-grade Ma yarn, which remained unchanged, the prices of the remaining yarns rose by 20,000 to 30,000 yuan. The price of 42-count yarn also rose by 50,000 yuan. Although the price increases were not drastic, the foundation was particularly stable. It is heard that the spot goods of various spinning mills are finding it difficult to meet demand. As a result, the prices of other brands of yarn also rose by varying amounts of 30,000 to 50,000 yuan. High-grade cotton gray fabrics have seen a surge in price in recent days by about 5,000 to 6,000 yuan per piece, because Fangjian has yet to release its leading products, and the peak season for colored cloth sales is approaching. Fangjian's market opening remains as originally planned, with dyeing and weaving factories being allocated fine cloth, while cloth shops' fine cloth ranges from No. 499 to No. 700, and gold lotus serge also ranges from No. 46 to No. 800, it is said.</p>
<h3>Measures for Transporting Yarn and Cloth to the South Have Been Drafted; Legitimate Manufacturers Can Still Engage in Reasonable Sales; Smuggling Routes and Quantities in Guangdong Province</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Our reporter recently visited Mr. Liu Wenteng, the Director of the Business Department of the Textile Industry Administration Committee, to inquire about the current situation of yarn sales to South China. He said: Regarding the situation of yarn and cloth sales to the South, he had telegraphed the Fangjian representative stationed in Guangdong for a detailed investigation. According to the first reply telegram, neither the Guangdong Customs nor the Goods Tax Bureau had such statistics. Now, after a second investigation, the results are quite detailed and can be described in four points: (1) All yarn and cloth in Guangzhou city are transported from Shanghai. Each month, approximately 18,000 to 20,000 bales of cotton yarn and approximately 10,000 bales of cloth are shipped. Among imported cotton yarns, 10-count, 20-count, and 30-count yarns are the most common. 32-count and 42-count fine yarns account for only a small portion. Among cotton fabrics, fine cloth and dyed cloth account for the largest proportion. Twill cloth, blue cloth, and various colored patterns are next in terms of volume. Chong serge is even less common. (2) In terms of yarn sales, due to the tax exemption for local cloth exports, the local cloth manufacturing industry in Guangzhou and Foshan is very developed. Regarding yarn sales in various locations, Guangzhou can sell approximately 1,500 bales per month. Foshan can sell approximately 2,000 bales per month. The sales volume in the various counties of the Four Districts (Siyi) is very small, only 50 to 60 bales per month, but Wuzhou sells approximately 2,000 to 3,000 bales per month. Among the counties in the Dongjiang area, Huizhou and Xingning have relatively high sales volumes, reaching approximately 1,000 bales. As for cloth sales, in terms of the quantity sold by Fangjian's branch in Guangzhou, Guangzhou accounts for 30%, Wuzhou accounts for 15%, Siyi accounts for 5%, the Dongjiang area accounts for 10%, and Hong Kong accounts for 40%. (3) Guangzhou yarn and cloth have always been prohibited from being transported to Hong Kong and Macau. However, speculators often declare to customs that they are transporting goods to Zhongshan, Xiaohang, and Sanbu, and then transship them to Macau. They declare that they are transporting goods to Dongguan and Changping, and then transship them to Hong Kong. They declare that they are transporting goods to Haikou and Zhanjiang, and then transship them to Annam (Vietnam). There are no formal channels for transporting goods to Vietnam, Hong Kong, and Macau through customs. (4) Recently, the export of locally made yarn and cloth from Hong Kong has also been prohibited. However, those who have applied for import can export according to the declaration. Therefore, the smuggling routes of smugglers, in addition to the third route, also include the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway and the Guangzhou-Kowloon Highway, passing through Shenzhen and cooperating with special forces to directly transport goods to Hong Kong. However, the yarn and cloth that does not pass through Macau can only be sold in Hong Kong. It is heard that the Hong Kong authorities may, at their discretion, allow exports when the stock in Hong Kong is abundant. It is estimated that the monthly smuggling volume is half of the yarn and cloth imported into Guangzhou.</p>
<p>It was also reported that the Textile Industry Administration Committee, having been instructed by the Executive Yuan on the 9th to draft temporary management measures for the transportation of cotton yarn and cloth to South China, has already jointly drafted the measures with Director Zhang Fuyun of the Customs Administration. These measures were submitted to Beijing last Saturday for review and are currently awaiting approval from the Executive Yuan. He stated that the drafting of these measures focuses on being based on evidence and being effective, striving to ensure fair implementation and scientific management, so that legitimate manufacturers can still engage in reasonable sales of yarn and cloth to the South China region.</p>
<h3>Capital of Companies During the Occupation; Ministry of Economic Affairs Instructs on Valuation Methods; Unregistered Companies Will Be Dissolved After the Deadline</h3>
<p>The registration of recovered areas has been extended by the Ministry of Economic Affairs until the end of this year and will not be extended further. All companies must complete the registration procedures within the specified period. Any company that fails to do so will be dissolved and liquidated. This so-called dissolution means that the company is deemed to no longer exist, and its rights, obligations, and sovereignty are extinguished. As for the capital adjustment and valuation calculation methods for companies during the occupation period, the Ministry has provided examples for clarification as follows: For example, a company originally had a legal tender capital of 1 million yuan, with each share worth 10,000 yuan. Later, it increased its capital by 9 million in puppet currency, totaling 900 shares. The two types of shares total 1,000 shares. The 9 million in puppet currency is converted into 45,000 yuan in legal tender according to the current fixed ratio. Together with the original legal tender capital, the total is 1,045,000 yuan. The newly added assets after the capital increase, valued in legal tender, are assumed to be 8 million in puppet currency. Calculated per share based on 1,000 shares, each share is worth 8,000 yuan. The 800,000 yuan obtained by the old shares is used as a reserve fund. The new shares total 7.2 million yuan. If converted according to the prescribed ratio, it is 42,000 yuan, which is still 1,755,000 yuan less than the original increased puppet currency amount. This difference can be resolved by the shareholders' meeting to make up for the shortfall, but the old shareholders must first subscribe with cash. If any of the old shareholders have never participated in the subscription of new shares in puppet currency, they should have priority in subscribing. If they give up their right, the new shareholders can subscribe to make up the full amount. If it cannot be determined, the shareholders' meeting should resolve to reduce the capital. As for the valuation result, including the 45,000 yuan converted according to the prescribed ratio, it must not exceed the original capital amount of 9 million yuan.</p>
<h3>After the Decline of Dutch East Indies and Japanese Tea, the Hope for Chinese Tea is Great; The Problem Lies in Whether Transportation Can Be Improved; Losses Will Be Significant if Handled by Non-Experts; British Expert Advises Tea Merchants Not to Repeat the Mistakes of Adulteration</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 18th] Mr. Weiden, former tea industry advisor to the Chinese government, published a paper stating that the Dutch East Indies, the world's third-largest tea producer, has completely halted exports due to political turmoil. According to reports, most of its tea plants were damaged during the Japanese occupation. Japan is now operating the tea industry, and Taiwan has also been returned to China. In 1941, the Dutch East Indies exported 167,048,000 pounds of tea. In 1937, Japan exported 54,194,000 pounds of tea, while Taiwan exported 23,117,000 pounds of tea. The world market will suffer a loss of approximately 240 to 250 million pounds per year due to the loss of these three production areas. In 1938, China's tea exports were: 24,009,000 pounds of black tea, 50,959,000 pounds of green tea, 4,135,000 pounds of brick tea, and 12,664,000 pounds of other types, totaling 91,767,000 pounds. With Japan and the Dutch East Indies excluded from the market, China has a good opportunity to make up for the world's losses with its production. Furthermore, after India and Ceylon fully restore black tea production, China will not face any strong competitors if it exports green tea to the United States and North Africa. The Taiwanese tea that can now be exported from China is of excellent quality and is said to enjoy a particularly high price in the United States. The problem facing the resumption of Chinese tea exports is whether the existing tea can be exported. Most of China's tea-producing areas are outside the Japanese-controlled areas, and all tea trees have not suffered from unharvested diseases. The current difficulty lies in whether the tea can be transported to major ports. Although transportation may be difficult, there must be a large number of ships traveling between the ports of Shanghai to facilitate the return voyage with tea. As for financial issues, China can contact various countries to raise funds. Although exchange rate stabilization is still lacking, which is inevitably a major obstacle, barter trade may be adopted. The question awaiting the Chinese government's response is whether the Chinese government can still directly negotiate export methods with various foreign firms as before the war, or whether it can establish its own institutions. In the author's observation, if this highly specialized matter is entrusted to personnel with no experience, the financial losses will be significant. Furthermore, this year's exports have not been satisfactory, with poor quality and high prices. 75% of the goods sold are often deteriorated. Taking high-quality Keemun tea as an example, the price in London is 8 shillings and 6 pence (including insurance and shipping costs), but the samples are vastly different compared to the goods of 1944 and 1945. It is heard that inland merchants often mix old tea with new tea. If inferior tea is priced too high, the reputation enjoyed by the Chinese tea trade will be lost, and purchasing merchants will seek other sources.</p>
<h3>Guaranteeing Merchants' Tax Payments; Direct Tax Bureau Declares that Trade Associations Have No Such Obligation</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The Municipal General Chamber of Commerce previously received a letter from the local Wine and Cuisine Trade Association, stating that it is legally unfounded and fraught with obstacles for the association to guarantee merchants' tax payments, and requested that it be abolished. The Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to the Direct Tax Bureau, requesting that the measure be abolished. The Bureau has now replied: "The application form and guarantee letter for resident merchants were formulated and issued by the Direct Tax Administration of the Ministry of Finance. It has been implemented in various inland provinces for a long time. All recovered areas have also implemented it long ago. It was not a free creation of this Bureau. Since the establishment of this Bureau, it has been observed that most merchants in Shanghai generally abide by the law. In addition, the organization of trade associations is sound. Therefore, there has been no need to handle the resident merchant guarantee for the time being. As for the Shanghai Wine and Cuisine Trade Association's statement that this Bureau is implementing this guarantee measure, or that the Bureau's district offices have occasionally adopted this measure to control tax revenue due to the closure of a small number of merchants, the Bureau has not issued such an order to force trade associations to provide guarantees." The Chamber of Commerce will inform the Wine and Cuisine Trade Association of the situation for its information.</p>

<h3>The Art of Health and Longevity; Why Do We Humans Die in Vain?</h3>
<p>— Original by Lawrence Lader, Published in the June 1946 Issue of Crown Magazine</p>
<p>We regularly inspect the cars we use to prevent damage, but why do we only pay attention to our own bodies and seek medical treatment after we become ill? Isn't that too late!</p>
<p>Someone never fell ill and usually exercised, but suddenly collapsed in the office and passed away a week later, not even reaching the age of fifty. Such a death is truly not worth it! This is because all chronic diseases develop silently, and patients are often unaware. However, according to medical statistics, if physical examinations are performed annually, early detection and timely treatment can prevent death. Most deaths are an unnecessary sacrifice. We may think we are very healthy, walking with great speed, with no signs of illness, but we do not know that most deadly diseases have no warning signs beforehand, and once they are discovered, it is too late! Dr. John of the New York Life Extension Institute reported that among a thousand businessmen who thought they were healthy and were buying cars or real estate, only one hundred and fourteen were truly healthy. Among them, sixteen cases had already suffered from quite serious illnesses. Because most people do not pay attention to real killer diseases, they unknowingly kill many people. For the sake of health, to avoid death that is not worth it, why not have a physical examination once a year? There is no loss of time and energy, but the benefits are endless. The value of the examination lies in preventing disease and detecting hidden problems. Many deadly diseases are very easy to cure if detected early. There are many examples. As for the cost of the examination, it is not too much. Why not spend a small amount of money to gain health and longevity! In this era of scientific advancement, wouldn't it be a great injustice to die in vain!</p>
<h3>Why Do We Abandon the Inestimable Harvest?; An Analysis of Health Examinations</h3>
<p>To conduct large-scale health examinations, in terms of manpower, we need three specialized physicians, four assistant nurses, two administrative staff, one clerk, three tea attendants, and two chemists. In terms of material resources, we need an X-ray machine, some testing equipment, a complete pathological chemistry laboratory, and five rooms. In terms of publicity, because the public lacks medical knowledge, to make people turn back from the sea of suffering from illness as soon as possible, so that diagnosis can achieve the goal of health, it is necessary to loudly advocate for it. In summary, the three items of expenditure are estimated at 4.02 million yuan for salaries, 1 million yuan for food, 4 million yuan for depreciation and interest on the X-ray machine, and other similar expenses, and 1.6 million yuan for publicity, totaling 14.62 million yuan. In one month, 342 readers of this newspaper received preferential examinations, with a total income of 2.33 million yuan. So, wouldn't this be a waste of money? No! We concentrate the contributions of science and sacrifice manpower and material resources, and there are inestimable harvests. We would like to present this to you and try to prove it with facts.</p>
<p>The Shin Pao History Museum called the hospital the other day to say that a gentleman from the Central Bank, who is currently staying in an ordinary ward, has been there for three months. They asked if he could receive free preferential treatment. After an investigation by the hospital's service department, it was learned that the gentleman had tuberculosis in both lungs. After considerable treatment, he has recovered. However, he now has an anal complication, and it is difficult to predict when he will recover. It is even more difficult to answer how the economy will be budgeted. If the gentleman had a health examination a year ago, he would not only have avoided infection in the intestines, but his health would have recovered in a way that was not out of sight, and the economy would not be in a difficult situation. Moreover, if one lung could be treated early, the other lung might not be affected. The cost of the examination at that time would have been no more than a few rickshaw fares, and he could have obtained inestimable health and happiness. But he missed the golden period for early treatment. Isn't it too late to seek relief now! According to the professional class, it is unfortunate to suffer from this chronic disease, which deprives individuals of their health and causes family and social tragedies. This kind of fact has been seen countless times in the ten years since the establishment of this hospital. Their sad and tragic experiences cannot be fully described in writing. For example, Miss Yingzi, an artist, didn't she play the role of Meibao in the play "Autumn Begonia" and win the audience's admiration, giving them a very deep impression? However, due to excessive hard work, latent tuberculosis was found. When X-ray examination revealed five cavities the size of silver dollars, scattered between the two lung lobes, she was hospitalized for treatment. Judging from the latent period, it must have been more than a year. It is a pity that the report was too late, and she has been hospitalized for three years. What can be estimated for the loss to her personally and to the artistic community? If she had obtained an X-ray diagnosis a year ago due to some opportunity, and thus received early treatment, what would have been her contribution to the artistic community in the past three years? If a reader unintentionally has a health examination, and that person discovers a latent lesion, and therefore receives early treatment, and recovers in a few months, not only will he regain his health and engage in production early, but he will also avoid infecting others. If, in a few decades, he becomes a great entrepreneur or a great inventor, benefiting society and the people, then what can be estimated for the harvest of his unintentional health examination in the past? Our service at this time, so-called health examination, is a sacred work, and it does not seem to be an exaggeration.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this inestimable harvest is still largely unknown to the general public (as can be seen from the small number of readers who received preferential examinations last month), and even some doctors have doubts. In fact, the more common health knowledge is, the more people will seek medical treatment. If everyone can go to various hospitals for various examinations before seeking medical treatment, and obtain an accurate pathological report, then the doctor can see everything at a glance and see the key to the problem, saving many procedures. Because the patient has obtained an accurate pathological report in advance, they will not delay the time and achieve the goal of quick treatment and quick recovery. Both parties can achieve twice the result with half the effort. Moreover, those who are proved to be healthy by the examination do not need to seek medical treatment again, so how much time and money is saved? Isn't the British people's health certificate justified? Our country's society has always paid little attention to public health. Although experts such as Li Tingan, Zhang Wei, and Liu Ruiheng have repeatedly said so (see below), the listeners are few, which is really heartbreaking! Today, people in all countries of the world know how to strive for their personal right to health as the foundation for survival and happiness. Why does our country's people alone ignore the health they should enjoy? It is really difficult to understand after thinking about it a hundred times. It must be known that the invisible killing of diseases is ten times or a hundred times greater than tangible war, and war has an end, but the war between mankind and disease has no end. In this era of scientific advancement, why do we not seek the protection of health and willingly die in vain?</p>
<p>If everyone can have a health examination, the earlier and more diseases will be discovered, the more doctors will be needed, and the fewer people will die in vain. The more common the examination work is, the broader the business of doctors will be, and the more health the people will improve. Examination and doctors are like fish and water, the two are inseparable. Without examination, doctors cannot make correct diagnoses and treatments. If patients do not have examinations, they have no way to examine latent diseases, and there is a danger of getting out of hand at any time. In short, the benefits of examination are really inestimable, but those who can reap this benefit belong to those who have an examination early. As for our work, it is only cultivation!</p>
<h3>During the Eight Years of the War of Resistance, 3.1 Million Soldiers and Civilians Died; The Number of People Who Died from Tuberculosis Reached 4.5 Million Last Year</h3>
<p>World War II gave mankind great terror and danger, but in fact, the danger of tuberculosis is no less than that. During the eight years of China's War of Resistance, the total number of soldiers and civilians who died, as announced, was only 3.1 million, but the estimated number of people who died from tuberculosis last year alone was approximately 4.5 million. Tangible enemies are certainly fierce, but the tuberculosis bacteria that cannot be seen with the naked eye are even more terrible and dangerous. Taking Shanghai as an example, the rampantness of tuberculosis is shocking. In the first six months of the 31st year of the Republic of China, the number of residents who died from tuberculosis in the British and French Concessions at that time was 2,269, while the total number of deaths from seven statutory infectious diseases was only 1,02. That is, the mortality rate of tuberculosis alone exceeded the total number of deaths from seven infectious diseases by 141.6%. Now, although the invaders have been driven out of the country, more ferocious enemies are still mixed in our families, institutions, organizations, factories, schools, and the entire society and country, allowing them to spread and grow, slaughtering 4.5 million innocent people every year, and making ten times more of them disabled and bedridden. So rampant, how significant is its relationship to national health. Moreover, the age of those who suffer from this disease is mostly between 20 and 45 years old. The prime of their useful years is spent on the sickbed, year after year, until their lives are cut short. How can the loss of manpower and material resources be calculated? Shanghai is like this, then other provinces and cities can be imagined. We are responsible for the health of the people, how can we turn a blind eye? It is hoped that the general pioneers and enlightened people and those who are enthusiastic about society will work together to kill this beast, so that the nation can be placed in the realm of health, and the shame of the sick man of East Asia can be washed away.</p>

<p>Hygiene and Medicine</p>
<h3>Modern Perspectives on Tuberculosis Prevention and Treatment (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Wu Shaoqing</p>
<p>Early Diagnosis and Treatment and Public Health Facilities</p>
<p>The possibility of curing tuberculosis varies with the severity of the disease: early stages are mild, late stages are severe; mild cases are easy to treat, severe cases are difficult to save. What we usually see is that those who come for treatment are mostly in the late stages. This is because when the disease is mild, there are no serious symptoms, or even no symptoms at all to attract the patient's attention; once the symptoms are obvious and they go to see a doctor, the easy-to-treat period has often been missed. Even if some remedy can be made, only one in four on average can be cured. Therefore, among the patients living in tuberculosis sanatoriums, those with advanced tuberculosis account for about 85% to 90%, the efficiency of treatment is very low, and the cost of money is even greater. The results over the years are limited. From the perspective of the entire anti-tuberculosis campaign, this is unwise and uneconomical. The way to improve this is to diagnose and treat early. The efficiency of treatment is higher, and the money and time spent by patients can be saved; the advantages and disadvantages are as different as heaven and earth. To implement early diagnosis and treatment, it is necessary to select groups with a higher tuberculosis rate, those who are in contact with tuberculosis patients, and people with higher susceptibility, and give them X-ray lung examinations before their symptoms are discovered. The most economical and reliable method is to use a small mobile X-ray machine, which costs only four cents per film in US dollars. Early patients who are found should be treated as soon as possible, paying a limited price and receiving great benefits.</p>
<p>Some people say that there are already so many people suffering from tuberculosis now that accommodating and treating them is already in short supply, and it is difficult to meet the current needs. Why bother to find early patients and make the problem even more difficult? This is a question that ordinary people should have. Little do they know that if these early patients are not found and treated as soon as possible, they will fill up the tuberculosis hospitals in the future and be impossible to cure, and those who occupy the beds for a long time must be these patients. This is a vicious circle that will never end. It is like us only saving a prairie fire without knowing how to bend the chimney and remove the firewood. However, since there are so many late-stage patients and so little hope of cure, if they are not admitted to the hospital, there is a risk of infecting others; if they are admitted to the hospital, they will stay for an indefinite period of time. What should be done? In countries with sound health systems, these patients should also be admitted to hospitals. Although the possibility of treatment is small, it can still serve the purpose of isolation. Our country is poor and financially exhausted, and human and material resources are extremely difficult. The minimum conditions for tuberculosis prevention have not yet been met. How can we live in these extremely limited hospitals for endless isolation? Moreover, the number of tuberculosis patients in the country is no less than millions, and trying to implement hospital isolation is like using a cup of water to put out a cartload of burning firewood, which is both impossible and unwise. The alternative is to use the services of public health nurses to implement isolation at home according to the law, so that patients' living habits are all in accordance with hospital regulations. What is especially important is to prevent infection to others. In addition, the establishment of clinics will allow patients to have doctors to diagnose and treat them and guide them on how to recuperate at any time. In this way, a lot of expenses can be saved, and both isolation and recuperation can be taken care of. This method may not be perfect, but it is an inevitable stage in our country's initial tuberculosis prevention. In the future, when hospitals become more popular and more beds are available, these late-stage patients must be admitted to the hospital to achieve the effect of isolation.</p>
<p>Clinics and Sanatoriums</p>
<p>These two items can be mentioned together because they are closely related and their main purpose is treatment. When it comes to treatment, the first thing that people usually want to ask is whether there is a specific drug that can cure tuberculosis. In recent years, the United States has paid special attention to this research. Although some drugs have caused a sensation for a while, there is still a lack of drugs that have special effects on the human body. Our treatment must still rely on past experience and recent knowledge, and we still regard bed rest, increased nutrition, and fresh air as golden rules. Although these are old tunes, they should not be taken lightly even today. As for lung compression therapy, the methods vary, and the way to choose depends on the patient's condition. The benevolent see benevolence, and the wise see wisdom, which lies in the doctor's ability to choose and use them well. Ordinary patients, due to lack of common sense about tuberculosis, often ask for injections, thinking that new methods of treating tuberculosis must involve injections. As a result, advertising drugs take the opportunity to show off, disregarding morality and engaging in false propaganda; and patients do not notice and are easily misled, gaining nothing but spiritual comfort, and there is absolutely no benefit to the crux of the disease. Their eagerness to seek treatment is understandable, but their foolishness is also pitiful. The loss of money is a small matter, but missing the treatment period is a great misfortune.</p>
<p>Tuberculosis is different from other diseases. Its recovery comes gradually, so there are strict regulations on its depth and extent. It cannot be said that the disease is cured just because the symptoms disappear. Therefore, a patient's desire to return to work cannot be determined by his own general feeling. Some patients, because their inherent occupation hinders their health, if they continue this kind of work, the disease may recur. Therefore, they must find ways to adjust it, or help them choose another occupation, so as to restore their production and economic capacity, and at the same time reduce the possibility of tuberculosis recurrence. All larger sanatoriums should have this vocational guidance agency. The United Kingdom has tuberculosis villages, where various crafts are organized, and patients who are gradually recovering participate in work under the guidance of doctors. There are also a few places in the United States where this is done sporadically. Now this kind of work is gradually developing on a large scale. Our country's industry is backward and its economic situation is extremely unstable. It may not be easy to establish such a large-scale institution under these circumstances. However, it can also be determined based on the local situation in each area, and private individuals or groups can be encouraged to establish it. In the future, it will be gradually promoted, and the assistance of both labor and management will be obtained to achieve a sound institution to complete the final link in the tuberculosis prevention and treatment process. In 1943, the United Kingdom, based on a proposal by Tang Linsheng, stipulated by law that unemployed people with tuberculosis, in addition to government subsidies for family living and child support, also receive government assistance for their own occupational rehabilitation. Several states in the United States also have similar relief measures. The purpose is to allow patients who seek medical treatment to be able to recuperate in the hospital with peace of mind, without the burden of family finances and the worry of their own unemployment. Only in this way can the patient's post-recovery work be considered thorough, and the highest level of tuberculosis prevention and treatment can be said to be achieved.</p>
<p>The above overview of the work is only a statement of the principles. As for the implementation plan, it depends on the degree of human, financial, and material resources. In today's China, there is an extreme lack of all three of these, and it is impossible to carry out a widespread program. However, the situations in various places are different, so it is better to select and run areas where these three conditions can reach a considerable level. On the one hand, promote the work, and on the other hand, train talents in order to gradually expand it. This kind of work is broad in nature and large in scale. It cannot be done by a small number of tuberculosis doctors, nor can it be undertaken alone by government health administrative agencies. Even if there is an anti-tuberculosis association in the local area, although the purpose is the same, it can only achieve one aspect of anti-tuberculosis. It is necessary to gather the strength of the people of the whole country. Regardless of whether the agency is official or private, all those whose purpose is to prevent tuberculosis must do their best and cooperate fully. What is even more important is the support of people who are enthusiastic about social causes. The American Tuberculosis Association, a public organization, raised as much as 17 million US dollars last year, and its source is entirely from free donations from the public, and the government has not allocated a penny. The sense of responsibility of its citizens can be seen from this. We should recognize tuberculosis as our common enemy. Regardless of whether it is north or south, whether it is men or women, whether it is old or young, we must be of one heart and one mind and go all out to fight it. The spirit of resisting Japan is like this, and the spirit of resisting tuberculosis should be even more so.</p>
<h3>The Spiritual Factors in Tuberculosis Treatment</h3>
<p>— Xia Zhenyi</p>
<p>The key to treating tuberculosis is the well-known "rest." But I know that many people do not have a deep understanding of rest. They often rest their bodies in bed, but their minds are still constantly planning their careers, trusting their lovers, worrying about their illnesses, and worrying about the burden of medical expenses. In short, there are all kinds of thoughts, rising and falling one after another, so that their nerves do not have a moment of peace. This is actually a common problem among tuberculosis patients, and it is also a serious obstacle to treatment. We know that the whole person includes both physical and mental aspects. Only physical rest, without mental or spiritual rest, is not complete rest, not real rest.</p>
<p>In addition to "rest first" in tuberculosis treatment, "nutrition" is also a necessary condition for treatment. The great physiologist Canuon once proved the close relationship between the mind and the body. Emotions such as fear, anxiety, and sorrow can stimulate the excessive secretion of adrenaline, resulting in physiological phenomena such as heartbeat, sweating, pupil dilation, increased blood sugar, and cessation of gastrointestinal peristalsis and secretion. Because of the cessation of gastrointestinal peristalsis and secretion, the result is reduced appetite, digestive disorders, and a serious threat to the nutrition of the whole body. This also creates an obstacle to the treatment of tuberculosis.</p>
<p>I often see many patients who panic when they experience hemoptysis, as if they have been sentenced to death. They cry all day long and cannot think about eating. In fact, hemoptysis is a warning bell for tuberculosis, and it is not necessarily a sign that the disease is incurable. You must seek medical attention and examination as soon as possible, which is the best way. If you only have unnecessary fear and worry, it is tantamount to destroying the fortress of your spirit yourself, giving germs the opportunity to expand and invade, thus invisibly forfeiting the good opportunity for you to be cured. I do not know how many mild tuberculosis patients, when the doctor tells them that there is a disease in the lungs, become afraid and anxious. Because of this mental factor, the initial tuberculosis patients who are easy to cure quickly turn into a serious and incurable state. How foolish is this!</p>
<p>From the perspective of psychiatry, I often encounter many anxiety states, nervousness or neurasthenia, and other kinds of neurosis, as well as severe mental depression occurring in tuberculosis patients. The reason for this is that the tuberculosis causes unnecessary fear, anxiety, and frustration, which makes the nerves tense for a long time. Health is what everyone seeks. If you already have a disease in your body, worry is futile. On the contrary, it leads to serious mental illness, which further creates an obstacle to treatment.</p>
<p>Anxiety and fear open the door for tuberculosis germs. Smart patients, you must be careful. The mind and body are inseparable. We must have an optimistic life, a happy mood, and a calm attitude to overcome your enemy—the tuberculosis demon.</p>
<h3>The Battle Between Humans and Germs (3)</h3>
<p>— By Qiao Shumin</p>
<p>Excerpted from "Infectious Disease Management"</p>
<p>(3) Susceptibility and Resistance</p>
<p>We are in the natural world, and the opportunities to come into contact with germs every day are countless. Fortunately, we have the ability to fight back, which is enough to defend us and prevent us from being completely susceptible to infection. This kind of resistance is very important to infectious disease managers. Now I will briefly describe the three aspects of general resistance, special resistance, and secondary factors related to resistance:</p>
<p>(1) General Resistance</p>
<p>A. Complete Skin—Most germs cannot reproduce on complete skin, nor can they break through the skin and enter the body. According to research by Arnold et al., normal skin is acidic (PH5.8-5.2), which is enough to eliminate ordinary germs. Therefore, the skin actually has some self-cleaning effect, probably related to the chemical properties of sweat.</p>
<p>B. Complete Mucous Membrane—The mucous membrane is often the gateway for germs to invade the human body, but it is not without resistance.</p>
<p>(1) Oral Cavity and Gastrointestinal Tract—The mucous membrane of the oral cavity has mucous fluid. The colloidal mucin contained in it and the saliva secreted by the oral cavity have the function of protecting and purifying foreign objects. If germs are swallowed into the esophagus and into the stomach, the gastric juice always has a very strong bactericidal effect, but it cannot exert its power on tuberculosis bacteria or amoebae that are protected by wax. However, when the body temperature is too high, gastric acid often decreases. Therefore, after diseases such as malaria or measles, dysentery or other gastrointestinal diseases often occur, probably due to this reason. The normal small intestine also does not contain bacteria, but when the body temperature is too high or there is a lack of vitamin A, the physiological function of the mucous membrane of the small intestine often loses its normal balance and is easily susceptible to infection.</p>
<p>(2) Nasopharynx, Throat, and Trachea—Due to the unique structure of the nose, most of the inhaled bacteria stop near the nostrils, and most of the bacteria that enter also adhere to the mucous membrane and reach the oral cavity due to the cleansing effect of mucus and villi. Therefore, the air in the trachea is mostly sterile under normal conditions.</p>
<p>(3) Conjunctiva—Tears clearly have the function of cleaning up invading germs. Also, tears are very rich in lysozyme, which is enough to destroy general germs.</p>
<p>(4) Mucous Membrane of the Genital Tract—The ordinary urethra does not contain germs because of the flushing effect of urine and the bactericidal effect of the acidic reaction of urine. The secretion of the cavity also has a very strong bactericidal power, but it is powerless to resist germs of venereal diseases and puerperal fever.</p>
<p>C. Phagocytosis</p>
<p>The phagocytosis of the human body was discovered three years ago. This function is extremely important for our resistance to general infectious diseases. Often after germs invade the human body, they encounter leukocytes in the body. Germs (or other foreign substances) actually have a force that attracts leukocytes, the so-called opsonin. This opsonin causes a physical change in a certain germ, thus causing the germ to be attacked.</p>
<p>D. Function of the Reticuloendothelial System</p>
<p>Reticuloendothelial system cells, such as splenic cells, liver Kupffer cells, lymph glands, bone marrow, adrenal glands, and vascular endothelial cells, all belong to this category. The free-moving histiocytes of this type of cell can compensate for the insufficient phagocytic power of general leukocytes, and can kill the remaining germs and wounded leukocytes, forming general granulation tissue, as seen in diseases such as tuberculosis, syphilis, and measles. Also, this type of cell has a great function in clearing germs in the blood. It can also eliminate the toxins of germs and produce antibodies. Approximately several bactericidal drugs, such as quinine, rely heavily on the function of these reticuloendothelial system cells in their pharmacological action.</p>
<p>E. Physiological Excretion—The excretion of germs and their toxins by patients through feces, urine, or bile is also one of the common phenomena of resistance to germs.</p>
<h3>The Principles of Tuberculosis Treatment</h3>
<p>— Sun Zhongliang</p>
<p>To heal and restore any part of the body from injury, the most important condition is "rest." The most obvious example is an injury to the hand or foot. We all know not to let it move in order to recover as soon as possible. This basic principle of "rest" also applies to the treatment of tuberculosis, and it is the most important condition before a specific treatment for tuberculosis has been invented.</p>
<p>The lung is a respiratory organ that expands and contracts day and night. When it is diseased and damaged, we cannot use our will to control it to keep it still to achieve complete rest. Therefore, we have to seek the next best thing, which is to reduce its movement and get partial rest. The degree of lung movement is determined by the physical and mental activity of the whole body (the degree of metabolism). The mission of respiration is to supply the oxygen needed for the activity of the whole body and to eliminate its by-product, carbon dioxide. It is obvious that when the activity of the whole body increases, the need for oxygen is greater, and the production of carbon dioxide is also greater. Therefore, the movement of the lungs also increases. Rest can reduce the number, depth, and force of lung breathing. Rest for tuberculosis patients refers to the rest of the whole body. Lying in bed, the brain must also abstain from thinking in order to get good rest, because thinking also requires energy to increase metabolism. As for the so-called walking in the morning or doing deep breathing exercises, especially the latter, which increases lung movement, it runs counter to the principle of rest and should never be tried.</p>
<p>In addition to the above-mentioned negative effect on the treatment of tuberculosis, rest also has its positive significance. After the activity of the whole body is reduced, the circulation of blood and lymph in the whole body and the lungs is also reduced. Therefore, the toxins absorbed from the lesion area are also reduced. Therefore, systemic poisoning symptoms such as fever, night sweats, cough, and sputum can also be reduced by rest. Generally speaking, lying in bed will reduce appetite or even hinder digestion is really unfounded. Furthermore, the decrease and stagnation of blood and lymph circulation around the lung lesions may promote the proliferation of fibrous tissue, which is the element of healing of tuberculous lesions. Reducing breathing and weakening blood circulation can reduce the oxygen supply to the lesion area. Tuberculosis bacilli rely on oxygen to survive. Under such circumstances, their activity is also reduced, and the reproduction rate is greatly reduced. These are all the benefits of rest for the recovery of tuberculosis.</p>
<p>Getting up and moving around must be based on the doctor's prescription. It occupies the intermediate stage between bed rest and starting work. It must be done after recuperation to a suitable period before it can be implemented according to the doctor's instructions. The duration and nature of the exercise must be determined based on the condition of the lesion and the patient's general condition.</p>
<p>Although compression therapy is not a specific treatment for tuberculosis, it is indeed a great help in treating this disease at present. Artificial pneumothorax is to inject gas into the chest cavity to reduce the lung volume, relax the lesion area and get rest. The stagnation of blood and lymph around it further helps the proliferation of fibrous tissue to surround the lesion, and at the same time reduces the absorption of tuberculosis toxins to reduce systemic poisoning symptoms; lung cavities heal due to the torsion or blockage of the bronchi that connect them, and eventually disappear. However, artificial pneumothorax must not have adhesions between the lungs and pleura to obtain good results. A small amount of adhesion may be cut off by electrocautery (Pneumolysis) so that part of the diseased lung can get good compression. Surgery on the phrenic nerve (Phrenci Operation) to paralyze the movement of the diaphragm and make the lower part of the lung get compression is also a method to promote the rest of the diseased lung. Thoracoplasty is a further step to remove the ribs of the diseased lung area, the chest wall collapses, reducing the lung volume, and is also aimed at making the diseased lung area get rest. These various compression therapies are mostly performed in cases where the lesions have ulcerated or become cavities. Their selection depends on the lesions, the patient's general condition, and the economic situation, and there is no fixed way to follow. At the same time, because they are not specific treatments for lung disease, in other words, it does not mean that after the operation, the disease will be cured like a gastrointestinal inflammation after surgery, we still cannot forget the basic principle of general rest. The whole body rest must be earnestly implemented according to the doctor's instructions in order to make the diseased lung recover as soon as possible.</p>
<p>In addition, in recent years, surgical treatment has tended to remove diseased lungs or lobes (Pneumonectomy or Lobectomy). This is a major operation and can only be applied after careful consideration by experts.</p>
<p>Nutrition is the second element in the treatment of tuberculosis. What we want is a general balanced diet, including adequate amounts of fat, protein, carbohydrates, minerals, vitamins, and other elements. Patients certainly need more nutrition than ordinary people, but they do not need to eat delicacies every meal, chicken, duck, fish, and meat. We require a slightly richer balanced diet than usual. Adding rest can make the weight gradually increase, from the level below the weight to slightly higher than the general standard, but we do not hope to exceed the standard weight too much. Weight gain is certainly a good phenomenon, but it does not necessarily mean that the lesions are healing. This is a point that should be paid attention to during the treatment period, so as not to neglect rest because of it.</p>
<p>Cool air (not cold air) can stimulate vitality and make patients feel happy, which is the third element in the treatment of tuberculosis. As for recuperation in another place, it must be decided after considering other more important conditions and the local treatment facilities and the patient's economic situation.</p>
<p>Finally, regarding drug treatment, a specific drug has not yet been successfully tested as of now. The pathological condition of tuberculosis is special, making it difficult for drugs to be effective, and generally, tuberculosis with very deep tissue damage may not be cured by drugs. Compression therapy will probably still maintain its position in such cases.</p>

<h3>The Slave's Blood (Novel)</h3>
<p>— Wang Ji</p>
<p>A pool of blood on the floorboards.</p>
<p>A pool of slave's blood.</p>
<p>The fresh blood that flowed from Ah Hua's veins the night before the Mid-Autumn Festival.</p>
<p>Ah Hua was a fourteen-year-old girl, bartered for three dou of rice by my mother at the end of last year. I don't know where she's from, but her accent suggests she's not far from here. She has no surname; according to her, everyone has called her Ah Hua since she was little, exactly the same name as the flower dog we keep at home. Oddly enough, "Ah Hua the person" had not been here for long, before "Ah Hua the dog" passed away. "Ah Hua the person" replaced "Ah Hua the dog."</p>
<p>To the point where a person is less than a dog.</p>
<p>Ah Hua isn't unintelligent, nor is she insensible, but like all children, she can't avoid being mischievous. Washing rice, carrying water, cooking, emptying chamber pots, she manages it all, but every task is always accompanied by some wildness: when washing rice, she'll try to catch fish, and if she catches one, she'll shout "Young master, young master" and rush in, only to receive a scolding from my mother, quickly dampening my enthusiasm. When tending the fire, she'll use charcoal sticks to doodle on the stove wall: human heads, the character for "heaven," things that look neither like dogs nor pigs. It suddenly reminds me of the psychology I studied at university, but my mother always gives her a stern scolding.</p>
<p>My mother is an old-fashioned woman from a humble background, in her late fifties. She always objects to us people in our twenties still studying, and objects to Ling Ling, my newly married wife, going to be a teacher. She rarely interacts with the outside world, spending her days quietly cultivating the land, raising silkworms, and sewing clothes for others. Her philosophical view on women is: lack of talent is a virtue.</p>
<p>Naturally, she expects the same of Ling Ling and Ah Hua.</p>
<p>Once, my mother asked Ah Hua to thread a needle, but she accidentally dropped it. In extreme anger, my mother coldly issued an order:</p>
<p>"Don't even think about eating until you find it!"</p>
<p>We had finished two meals, and Ah Hua was still squatting on the ground, feeling around. It got dark, but she didn't dare to light a fire for light. In a rush, her cautious little heart began to tearfully sob.</p>
<p>"Cry, and you can forget about it!"</p>
<p>Ling Ling bought a needle and secretly gave it to Ah Hua. I thought the matter would probably be over.</p>
<p>"Oh, good eyesight, you found it! Hmph, you think you can fool my wife, whose eyesight is failing? Skimping and saving, only to indulge like this! Who cares about this thing."</p>
<p>The needle was thrown on the ground, and no one wanted to say another word.</p>
<p>Ah Hua didn't dare to sleep, and was bitten by mosquitoes all night. The next day, red spots appeared on her skin, gradually becoming festered. Ling Ling wanted to apply red mercury on her, but she was afraid of trouble at first, but eventually mustered her courage.</p>
<p>"Don't bother, young mistress, lest I get another scolding from madam. We are born to suffer, we wouldn't even care if we rotted to death." It didn't sound like the words of a child. Ling Ling lanced a few of the pustules.</p>
<p>My mother saw it and glared at Ah Hua venomously.</p>
<p>"Red medicine? The young mistress is so considerate. Ah Hua, you are lucky. This bottle of stuff was left behind by the master. Even my wife is reluctant to use it, and now it's your turn, your turn, you cheap thing!"</p>
<p>Ling Ling finished her meal silently and went to school. I was going to a classmate's house because it was a day to be at school. When I came back in the evening, no one was in the living room, no one was in the study, and even the backyard was empty.</p>
<p>A cry came from the back upstairs:</p>
<p>"Young mistress!… Young master, save me! I'm being beaten to death!… I'm being beaten to death!…"</p>
<p>Then my mother's voice:</p>
<p>"I'll beat you to death, you cheap thing, you, are you eating the rice? Unwilling? Get out! Throwing rice in the river to feed the fish? Forty thousand yuan for a dan of rice, and you, you cheap thing, are only worth three dou of rice! You… you… today, you won't even let me quietly and thoughtfully recite the 'Stove Classic'!… Answering back? What? Still saying you accidentally bumped into madam?…"</p>
<p>I couldn't stop her. A slap landed on Ah Hua's mouth, and her lips immediately swelled high. Another slap, another slap, on her cheeks, nose, eyes, all covered in scarlet blood, covering Ah Hua's face, dripping onto the floorboards.</p>
<p>"You've all spoiled her, beating? It's not like I've never bought maids before. Too young? Fourteen years old is too young? Didn't Qiu Lan also start at fourteen, washing clothes, gathering firewood, doing everything? Maids need to be disciplined, they need to be kept in line! Guidance? Bah, nonsense, look at how you treat your daughters like treasures, your good wife even buys water caltrop to feed her, that's what you call guidance?"</p>
<p>Another slap, another series of blood splatters, falling on the floorboards, glistening…</p>
<p>In the middle of the night, "Ah Hua the person" left like "Ah Hua the dog."</p>
<p>A pool of blood on the floorboards.</p>
<p>A pool of slave's blood.</p>
<p>The Mid-Autumn moon kissed the earth brightly.</p>
<h3>Tagore's Quotes</h3>
<p>— Tian Rui</p>
<p>When we are most humble, we are nearest to greatness.</p>
<p>Let the dead have the immortality of fame, but the living the immortality of love.</p>
<p>, where are you? Night is like a black stone. Roaring in the sky… May the fire of love be rekindled to accompany your life.</p>
<h3>Nostalgia</h3>
<p>— Yi Feng</p>
<p>In the days without flowers, I miss the flowers; in the cloudy years, I yearn for the sun; on this lonely day! I yearn for the land where my footprints remain.</p>
<p>Clear memories tell me: it has only been four months since I left the mountain city, yet I feel like a child who has just left his mother's embrace, with endless longing for it. I miss the solemn life in the mountain city, I miss the free air in the mountain city, and I especially miss those friends in the mountain city who are working hard today to strive for a beautiful tomorrow. From their hard struggles, I gradually had the doors and windows of my wisdom opened. I began to understand laughter, understand crying, and understand even more the joys and sorrows of life. Therefore, I have love and hate for reality.</p>
<p>Sometimes, due to the whip of life, or the indignation towards reality, I once hated the mountain city, resented the mountain city, and even cursed the mountain city. But looking at it today, these are just childish pranks. It is not my true intention at all, nor will it damage my sincere feelings for it. On the contrary, because of this kind of twist, I feel a deeper nostalgia for it today. Romain Rolland said it well: "We can only have a deep understanding of the people we are close to all day long after we are apart." This is perhaps a depiction of my current mood!</p>
<p>In the nine years of my wandering life, I have spent five years in the mountain city. Five years ago, on a dusk evening, when I first stepped into the mountain city with tired steps, the mountain city was being submerged in the fire of bombing. Although there was no light, I could clearly see, with the help of the red flames, a terrifying and tragic picture dyed with blood: burnt houses, messy corpses, and the overflowing decay on the streets… It almost made me wonder if I had stepped into Dante's purgatory.</p>
<p>Under such destruction, and under such lashes, the mountain city has always accepted the tests of the times and shouldered the mission of history with a solemn and dignified attitude. She has never shown any sign of surrender, nor a single moan of pain. With this, she endured the years of suffering and welcomed the dawn of victory.</p>
<p>The inspiration the mountain city gave me is great and persevering. The training the mountain city gave me is solemn and dignified. In the years of suffering, the people living in the mountain city also had their joy and pride, because they were nurtured in a free atmosphere, breathing sweet and light air. They dared to laugh loudly, cry loudly, call for and accuse when the situation was tense, and sing and praise on the days of victory. In a free and unrestrained environment, they poured out the love and hate in their hearts, and the brilliant light shone on the "Lighthouse of East Asia" by gathering these free voices. …</p>
<p>In the past five years, I have met many friends from all walks of life. Some are civil servants who stick to their posts, some are primary school teachers who work hard on an empty stomach, some are diligent college students… Their environments may not be the same, but their experiences and ideals are exactly the same. They are willing to use their own suffering to build the happiness of the people, and use persistent efforts to exchange for a victorious tomorrow.</p>
<p>These touching scenes have passed, but thinking back, I still feel infinite excitement and concern. I will never forget.</p>
<p>When I first came here, I still held the same pious belief as the pilgrims worshiping Jerusalem. Although I occasionally saw some unpleasant things and felt annoyed, I never had resentment and disappointment. But today, I am in pain, and I feel a chill into my bones. I am lonely, I am alone, I hate this moldy city, so I deeply miss that distant mountain city. Friends in the distance, can you give me some comfort?</p>
<h3>An Inch of Mountain, an Inch of Blood 38</h3>
<p>— Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>How should I put it? I don't need to describe her appearance. You only had to see her return home, and within moments, Changxindian would be buzzing with the news: "Miss Mei has returned to the mansion, our Changxindian is no longer so humble!" The local mothers would have to say to their daughters, "You may not have been born with good looks, and that's your father and mother's fault; and your ancestors didn't have that kind of virtue either; but you have to go to Miss Mei's mansion to get some inspiration, see how she behaves, learn even a tenth of her ways and I won't feel like I raised you in vain!"</p>
<p>Miss Mei was such a good child; she didn't act like a privileged young lady, she didn't adopt the pride of a female student, and she had no temper at all. There was only one old servant woman doing the rough work at home; seven people, cooking, boiling, washing, scrubbing, she couldn't manage it all. Her mother had to spend all day managing the household affairs, mending the torn clothes, adding new fabric to the bigger ones, and altering the old ones for the younger ones. She had to put some thought into it, try some new patterns, otherwise the younger ones would refuse, and protest, saying "the treatment isn't fair." To the outside world, even though the father was poor, he was still a civil servant of some standing, and he had to maintain his image. Plus, he naturally loved to show off, so we children couldn't make him lose face. As a result, Mrs. Wu had to plan and arrange things all day long, so busy she could barely breathe. Can you imagine such a good child as Miss Mei, coming home from school, still acting like a spoiled young lady, putting on airs like a female student?</p>
<p>No. She understood that very well. Every time she came home, whether it was winter vacation, summer vacation, or a holiday, she would get up before dawn, take care of herself, and then help her younger siblings, arranging their homework, and reviewing their lessons; taking apart old velvet ribbons, washing, drying, and winding them into coils, designing and weaving new patterns; if there was new fabric, she would first plan who to add it to; cutting with scissors, using an iron, sewing, mending, shirts, qipaos, underwear, she could do it all, and they all looked good, no doubt about it. Seeing her mother unhappy, she would think of ways to make her laugh. Sometimes when her father was tired, she could even cook herself, even if Changxindian couldn't buy fat fish, big meat, or anything like that, just a few pieces of dried tofu, a packet of peanuts, plus something else, she could make three or two delicious dishes to go with the wine.</p>
<p>"Dad, even though you have such good bones, and you're not too old, you can't overwork yourself, … Have a glass today, it's rare to find such good white liquor in Changxindian, you pay, consider it my treat." She said it so sweetly.</p>
<p>Could the father not accept? "Fen, look how well our child speaks, we pay, and she treats us. … Okay, let's eat hers, come on, Fen, you disturb her for a glass too. I don't want to swallow it all alone, let's all have a sip…"</p>
<p>Fen was the wife's given name, ever since he wrote love letters, she had been his "Fen". Although she was almost forty, the mother of five children, she didn't look her age, and when she dressed up carefully, she really looked like the eldest sister in the family. Good features, good looks, skin like a southerner, but with the healthy frame of a northerner.</p>
<p>"Really," Fen smiled, "Our child was born with such a clever mouth. But then again, you gave the money, that's true, but if she wants to buy flowers, powders, or whatever, could you stop her from using it? Can't this little bit of money be considered her personal savings?…"</p>
<p>With such an eldest daughter, the second daughter, Lanjun, although only thirteen years old, was no exception. If you were to rate the two sisters, the older sister would be excellent, and the younger sister would probably get a "top-top" or "top-middle." If there was a shortcoming, it was that the older brother, Shiren, was somewhat barbaric, liked to play pranks on her, pull her pigtails, trip her, and so on, and she couldn't resist, so she would just shout loudly, "I'm telling Mom!"…</p>
<p>Little Dingxiang, Zhujun, was a little imp; being likeable was her forte. The younger brother, Shiyi, was the family's radio station, singing or loudly imitating this person or that reading from morning to night. If you didn't hear his voice for a few minutes, you could be sure he was up to no good.</p>
<p>All the children were lovely. If you had such a family, even though you were always arguing with the god of poverty, and things were just starting to look a little better, but then the Japanese devils came, with their cannons roaring to the sky, you, if you put yourself in Wu Engineer's shoes, what would you do?</p>
<h3>Chen's Sesame Cakes</h3>
<p>— Hong Weifa</p>
<p>Everyone who has lived in Yangzhou for a relatively long time should know that the sesame cakes from Chen Xiao Si's house are very delicious. These sesame cakes, like crab shell yellow, Huizhou cakes, etc., whether sweet or salty, sometimes sold for a dime apiece before the war, but the business became even more prosperous as the price increased. His sesame cake shop was located on Zuo Wei Street, which is the financial district of Yangzhou. The banks and money shops there always thought of his sesame cakes for their daily snacks.</p>
<p>Although the sesame cakes from Chen Xiao Si's house were good, Chen Xiao Si's temper was very bad. Buying sesame cakes from him was like going to the hospital to register for treatment, with first-come, first-served, you had to follow the order. If you tried to jump the line or urge him, he would very impolitely return the money to you: "Please go buy somewhere else." This straightforward behavior was naturally not pleasing, but in order to eat the sesame cakes he made, you had no choice but to obediently follow his lead.</p>
<p>Because his business was booming, he made a lot of money, so he wholeheartedly cultivated his three sons. And he also had a very virtuous wife who could read a few words. As for himself, he could barely read the newspaper and could drink a few cups of wine. Every night, after he stopped working, he would first read the newspaper, and then leisurely drink his wine. He often looked at his virtuous wife and good sons with hazy, drunken eyes, and had beautiful dreams. He felt that the sesame cakes he made every day were like square bricks, constantly paving a smooth road, which would eventually lead him to a state of happiness. He thought: Can't the hard work of the present be exchanged for the happiness of the future? But for thirty years, this good dream of his completely woke up. Looking back now, what a tragic nightmare it was!</p>
<p>The nightmare unfolded like this. After his eldest son finished elementary school, he was introduced to work as a trainee in the telephone bureau, and was promoted from trainee to operator. This was the first bridge for him to reach a state of happiness, so of course he was very happy. Who would have thought that this eldest son would die of tuberculosis! Then his very virtuous wife, who could read a few words, also left him forever due to the attack of tuberculosis. This really gave him a great trauma to his soul. But this great trauma gradually healed with time. Originally, his second son graduated from middle school and went on to university, and after graduating from university, he became a middle school teacher. Everyone knew that the position of middle school teacher was much higher than the operator that his eldest son had once been. And his third son actually went to university and even managed to struggle to Japan to study literature. Weren't these two more reliable bridges to lead him to a state of happiness?</p>
<p>But Chen Xiao Si had no idea that his third son in Japan also had tuberculosis and died in Japan a few years before the outbreak of the Anti-Japanese War. His second son did not dare to tell him this bad news, fearing that he would not be able to withstand this blow, but he was always worried about himself, worried that the devil of tuberculosis would also attack. Then the Anti-Japanese War began, and the flames of war quickly burned to this ancient city of Yangzhou. His second son, with tears in his eyes, followed the thousands of people who fled to the rear. He always thought that one day he could bring victory home to comfort his hardworking old father, and then tell him the bad news of his younger brother who had died in Japan. Because the period of the Anti-Japanese War was too long, his second son did not wait for the arrival of victory, and worry became reality, and he was also swallowed by the devil of tuberculosis. In this way, Chen Xiao Si's beautiful dream ended, revealing a tragic nightmare.</p>
<p>Chen Xiao Si's two sons deaths, Chen Xiao Si probably know the full truth of it now, after the war. A few years before the Anti-Japanese War, because his second son had already become a middle school teacher, and his income was enough to maintain the family life, he no longer made sesame cakes, and let others open the sesame cake shop. But recently, he started making sesame cakes again in the same place. This is like a famous actor who has been retired for a long time suddenly going back on stage, and the business will still be prosperous. It's just that he no longer has any beautiful dreams. Now in front of him are the widowed daughter-in-law and granddaughter, what else can he have? Or rather, what hopes does he dare to place on them! He is only busy maintaining the cost of living for the few mouths who were fortunately abandoned by the devil of tuberculosis. The sesame cakes he makes by hand seem to have transformed into bricks for building his own tomb. He struggled on the road of life for decades, but was defeated by tuberculosis, and defeated very badly. He himself did not expect it, and neither did the people who liked to eat his sesame cakes. Thinking about it, his sesame cakes now probably have many bloody tears stained in them, but who will taste this different flavor! (Yangzhou Continued Dreams 12)</p>

<h3>Engineering Talents</h3>
<p>— Shao Fu</p>
<p>If people cannot use their talents to the fullest, there is no way to talk about social progress.</p>
<p>There were two senior engineers, last August in Chongqing, after the victory of the Anti-Japanese War. I saw that they were both very excited, busy doing this and that, always thinking that engineers should dedicate their skills, but unexpectedly, in the year since the victory, they have been unemployed for a year. The authorities established a temporary agency, letting them do paperwork without any real effect. It seemed to be considerate and intended to provide for their old age.</p>
<p>There was also a group of engineers who were sent to the United States for internship. They recently returned to China. More than forty of them have been delayed in Shanghai. They are not living as rentiers, because they were mostly civil servants in the past and have not made a fortune, but are living in apartments waiting for work. The factories in the United States once wanted to keep these people, but they were not greedy for life in the United States. Their motherland cultivated them, and they resolutely returned, ready to serve their motherland.</p>
<p>According to ordinary human sentiment, these experts should be "undiscriminating in their choice of food" in their hunger, but I know that in Shanghai, they have neither been tempted by foreign merchants, nor have they turned to any business idea, nor have they shown any negativity. Every day they are collecting engineering information from various places, planning this road, planning that port. This scene may be considered by some people to be the attitude of bookworms, but those who are bookworms have to admit the impact of these people on society and their weight.</p>
<p>Good people can withstand tempering, and society is not blind. We are moved by the actions of these people, admire them, and hope that the government will not let them idle for too long.</p>
<h3>Whose Hong Kong?</h3>
<p>— Jin Xia</p>
<p>On the 14th of this month, a spokesman for the Hong Kong government issued a statement denying that Kowloon City is still Chinese territory. (According to the "Beijing Treaty" of 1898, "The Chinese officials stationed in Kowloon City shall still be able to perform their duties in the city." I don't know if this spokesman is forgetful, or if the treaty has another interpretation?</p>
<p>At the general meeting of the Shanghai Municipal Council on the 16th of this month, a resolution was unanimously passed: requesting our government to negotiate the recovery of Hong Kong, Kowloon, and Macau.</p>
<p>In fact, as early as February 7 this year, the standing committee of the Guangdong Provincial Council had already made the same resolution, and had telegraphed the government to negotiate with the British, but we have not heard any further news?</p>
<p>Sir Stafford Cripps, leader of the British Labour Party, declared in London on December 19 last year: Britain should quickly and "magnanimously" return Hong Kong to its original owner, in exchange for the lasting friendship of a broad China, and to enhance Britain's moral position and prestige in Asia.</p>
<p>It can be seen that this person's vision and insight are sharper than our senators'. Unfortunately, there are not many British people with a clear mind like Sir Stafford.</p>
<p>After our country's victory, the British built an airport near Pingshan in Kowloon, turning twenty villages, dozens of households, 10,000 mu of fields, and more than 20,000 villagers into flat ground, leaving them homeless. Our government protested, but I don't know what the real situation is at present?</p>
<p>In the international sense, the importance of the Hong Kong and Kowloon issue is at least equal to that of the Northeast!</p>
<p>Shifting our attention to Hong Kong, we can see—</p>
<p>Hong Kong has a population of over one million, of which 92 percent are Chinese. According to the Health Bureau's estimate, the number of rats in Hong Kong is equal to the population.</p>
<p>Opium, alcohol, horse racing, dance halls, prostitution, and other entertainment venues are all available. The pleasure consumption of the wealthy alone is often over HK$10 million per year.</p>
<p>Alcohol tax, tobacco tax, and betting tax (including horse racing and other gambling), and entertainment tax account for a large portion of the Hong Kong government's budget revenue.</p>
<p>Between July and August this year—more than a hundred wealthy merchants moved from our country to Hong Kong, and funds of HK$100 million poured into Hong Kong, prospering Hong Kong and weakening our country's economy.</p>
<p>Hong Kong is a paradise for the upper-class Chinese.</p>
<p>Some people also say: it is a paradise built on hell.</p>
<p>I think it is precisely a blood-drawing needle inserted into our country's veins!</p>
<h3>Shaoxing Opera and Killing a Husband</h3>
<p>— Chi Mo</p>
<p>Zhan Zhou Shi, who killed her own husband, has now been sentenced to death. She was trembling when she heard the verdict.</p>
<p>A reporter asked her, "How did you know that the body could be put in a box?"</p>
<p>She quickly replied, "I saw it in Shaoxing opera (Yue opera)."</p>
<p>Yes, she was not lying. There are several Shaoxing operas where women throw male corpses into boxes. The ones that can often be seen are "Borrowing the Red Lantern." In "Borrowing the Red Lantern," the body of "Lin Fengchun" is also hidden in a box. There is also "Jade Dragonfly" with "Shen Guisheng," and many other operas. I don't need to introduce them one by one here.</p>
<p>Moreover, the women in Shaoxing operas who throw dead people into boxes all become first-rank ladies in the end, and none of them are sued.</p>
<p>This time, Zhan Zhou Shi is not only being sued, but she will also be shot or hanged. Isn't Shaoxing opera harming her?</p>
<p>Science Knowledge</p>
<h3>On Hair Perms</h3>
<p>— Jia Ling</p>
<p>American science advances rapidly, and the cosmetics industry also changes with each passing day. Ladies' "cream perms" can now be replaced by "cold perms." This type of "cold perm" requires neither electricity nor a perm machine. It can be done anywhere, anytime, truly simple, convenient, and safe.</p>
<p>You don't have to rush to the barber shop or beauty salon; you can just buy two types of hair curling solution at your home and start the "cold perm." First, carefully wash your hair, removing all scalp oil and dirt. Then, use the first solution, which will cause the hair to naturally wrinkle and curl, allowing you to create any desired style. Then use the second solution to fix it. A beautiful and novel curly hairstyle is produced. Finally, wash away the remaining solution, and the "cold perm" is complete. Several cosmetics companies have been producing this type of curling solution for some time, but it is likely restricted by customs regulations and has not yet been marketed in our country. Of course, we also don't hope it comes!</p>
<p>To put it bluntly, this trick is not mysterious at all, but merely a chemical and physical change. The first solution contains Ammonium Thioglycollate, and the second solution is simply acidified hydrogen peroxide.</p>
<p>Originally, 15% of the protein in our hair is Cystine. Those who have studied chemistry know that a Cystine molecule is formed by two amino acids linked by two sulfur atoms. These constantly interwoven Cystine chains give the hair its unique shape and properties. If the -S-S- of Cystine is cut off, then the hair can be changed into any curve and shape, no longer adhering to its original form. The Ammonium Thioglycollate in the first solution of the perm can reduce -S-S- to two -SH Cysteine. The acidified hydrogen peroxide causes the rearranged Cysteine to recombine into Cystine. Thus, the curl is formed, stable and lasting, just like natural.</p>

<h3>Statistics</h3>
<p>— Xin Fang</p>
<p>Six years of primary school, based on the lowest tuition fees for Shanghai primary schools today, twelve semesters would cost 1.2 million yuan.</p>
<p>Six years of middle school, at 150,000 yuan per semester, twelve semesters would cost 1.8 million yuan.</p>
<p>Four years of university, at a minimum of 200,000 yuan per semester, four years would cost 1.6 million yuan.</p>
<p>A university graduate who has studied for sixteen years would have spent 4.6 million yuan on tuition over those sixteen years. If calculated at the lowest interest rate of 10%, 4.6 million yuan would yield 460,000 yuan per month. But I ask, can a university graduate just entering society today find a "job" that earns 460,000 yuan per month?</p>

<h3>Zhou Fohai is Here: Watch the Grand Finale</h3>
<p>— Yu Ren</p>
<p>Let's hear his confession!</p>
<p>Chen Gongbo was executed by firing squad, Chu Minyi was executed by firing squad, Mei Shiping was executed by firing squad... Several major traitors have almost been judged or have died. Thus, everyone is thinking even more of those "Lord Zhou Fohai" and "Lord Luo Daqingtian" and others who were far away in Chongqing. There has been no news of them for a while. Not long ago, the newspapers even said that they were riding in jeeps and frequenting dance halls in Chongqing, "their demeanor undiminished from their earlier days," which made people even more confused.</p>
<p>But don't rush! Have you watched Peking opera? The opening is always some insignificant acts, and the famous actors naturally only appear at the end. Now, all the major traitors have been dealt with, and it is precisely the time for these few "surviving" "tycoons of treason" to take the stage. Thus, a plane sent them to the Ninghai Road Detention Center in Nanjing.</p>
<p>Among the names of the five major traitors: Zhou Fohai, Ding Mocun, and Luo Junqiang are naturally "renowned" and need no introduction; and there are two others! Ma Jiliang and Yang Qiuhua were both subordinates of the traitor Zhou. This time, the five men "returned to the capital" by plane, carrying hundreds of pieces of luggage, countless gold bars and gold ingots, and several attendants and servants. The demeanor of "ministers" is, after all, extraordinary!</p>
<p>Everyone is watching the opening of this grand finale, expecting a wonderful performance. In court, they may talk eloquently: how they loved the country, how they "endured humiliation and bore heavy burdens," how they "covered up underground work," and that they even "surrendered" a few days before the victory! However, there are eighteen twisted arguments, but there is only one principle of justice in the world: "Death to traitors!" Everyone should wait and see: when they are escorted to the execution ground one day, let them go to "rest in peace"!</p>

<h3>The Military Adventures of Sanmao (105)</h3>

<p>News Figures</p>
<h3>Senior Figure in Journalism: Mr. Shao Lizi</h3>
<p>— You Nan</p>
<p>Among the famous figures of the Party and State, the one with the most interesting anecdotes and stories is Mr. Shao Lizi. Mr. Shao was a successful candidate in the late Qing imperial examinations, worked as a teacher, served as a newspaper editor, and was also a Communist Party member who was expelled from the party, a private secretary, a provincial chairman, an ambassador, a propaganda minister, a university president, and an army major general... His titles and experiences, if printed in six-point type, could fill an entire card.</p>
<p>The Wind Blows the Willow's Hair</p>
<p>In order to prevent omissions, let's start from the beginning and recount Mr. Shao's past anecdotes. Mr. Shao's given name was Wen Tai, his courtesy name was Zhonghui, and Lizi was just his pen name. He was from Shaoxing, Zhejiang, and was known as a "prodigy" and "little Cao Zhi" for his intelligence and love of learning since childhood. When he was twelve years old, a father's colleague visited him and jokingly said, "Since you have the name of a prodigy, let me give you a couplet to match. If you answer well, I will give you ten yuan for you to buy something to eat." He gave the first line, "Raindrops wash the face of flowers," and Shao casually replied, "The wind blows the willow's hair." The father's colleague was greatly amazed and immediately rewarded him with ten gold coins. At the age of fourteen, he entered the local school as a scholar, and at sixteen he passed the imperial examinations.</p>
<p>In the late Qing Dynasty, Yu Youren founded a normal school in Chang'an, and Shao was hired as a professor. In the first year of the Republic, he joined the Minli Bao as an editor, and later served as an editor for the Minguo Ribao, Shenghuo Ribao, and Juewu Bao. At that time, the Minguo Ribao was short of funds, and had cut back to the point where there was nothing left to cut. It was even unable to afford out-of-town special dispatches. But a dignified newspaper could not be without special dispatches. Shao, in desperation, used his quick wit and went to the Xin Shenbao (editor's note: not the "Xin Shenbao" of the enemy-puppet era.) every evening to visit his friend Sun Dongwu, the chief editor. They would chat and laugh, appearing carefree, but in fact, when Sun was reading the special dispatches, Shao would watch carefully and memorize them all. After saying goodbye and returning to his office, he would immediately sit at his desk and write, changing the wording and sending out the special dispatches from various places as usual. He did so without missing a single detail. Shao's memory and quick wit can be seen from this.</p>
<p>A Heavily Made-Up Old Woman</p>
<p>Shao and the late Central Committee member Ye Chucang shared a room at the Minguo Ribao office. At that time, the office was located next to the Lao Yangqing He Silver Shop. When they had nothing to do, the two often looked out the window at the female customers entering and leaving the silver shop. Ye once recited a limerick: "Having the fragrant neighbor Yangqing He, I watch the beautiful women morning and night." Shao continued, saying, "Sometimes I strain my neck in vain, and encounter a heavily made-up old woman." Shao's early humor and talent were originally in the nature of a scholar, so it is not surprising!</p>
<p>Before long, Shao joined the Communist Party and was elected as a member of the Central Committee. In the fifteenth year, he was expelled from the party. Shao also published a notice in the newspaper at the same time announcing his separation from the Communist Party. Just then, Chairman Chiang admired his great talent and hired him as his secretary, respecting him as he would a good teacher and friend. During his time at the newspaper, Shao advocated revolution but did not suffer imprisonment. Unexpectedly, in the fourteenth year, when he served as the major general director of the political department of the Whampoa Military Academy, he experienced a night in jail. Shao had just arrived at Whampoa when President Chiang set off on the Second Eastern Expedition. Shao and his guards rushed to meet him. When they arrived in Dongguan, Shao was detained overnight by the military police because the license number of the guards' firearms did not match. This was Shao's first trip south, and he was unknown, so it happened. He was released on bail by the school the next day.</p>
<p>Having Been to the Soviet Union</p>
<p>In the twenty-first year, Shao served as the chairman of the Gansu Provincial Government, in the twenty-fifth year as the chairman of the Shaanxi Provincial Government, and in the twenty-ninth year as the ambassador to the Soviet Union. Shao had twice gone to the Soviet Union for inspection in the fourteenth and seventeenth years. In the nineteenth year, Shao held his wedding in the capital, and his wife, Ms. Chuan Xuewen, was whom Shao met during his travels in the Soviet Union. Before serving as ambassador to the Soviet Union, Shao served as the Minister of Central Propaganda, which was his old profession, so he was of course competent and outstanding.</p>
<p>Shao has a fondness for collecting books, and his collection mostly consists of classics on party history, archaeology, and the like. It is said that he has a habit of picking his feet and must do so every day, which can truly be called an eccentric habit of an elegant man. I wonder if he suffers from "Hong Kong foot"?</p>
<p>Shao is already sixty-three years old, but since the victory, he has been busy running around for unity. He is truly a respectable elder!</p>
<h3>Habit</h3>
<p>— Hong Yin</p>
<p>Habit is an extremely terrible and extremely lovely thing; when a bad behavior becomes a habit, one may suffer from it for life and be unable to change it; conversely, when a good behavior becomes a habit, you will unconsciously benefit from it for life, and it will become your most loyal companion, which you cannot drive away even if you try!</p>
