<h3>周恩來訪吉倫商談　東北小組開始工作　工鑛技術員分批出關</h3>
<p>〔本報重慶二日電〕據悉：周恩來昨曾晤馬歇爾代表吉倫將軍，商談有關停止衝突問題，三人會議政府代表尙未決定，據悉陳誠將軍出任代表之可能性最大。</p>
<p>〔本報北平二日電〕軍事調處執行部工作，已較前兩週略見緊張，但三委員中除美方饒伯森自渝返平，維持正常工作外，葉劍英已臥病三日，未到部辦公，鄭介良亦未返平。但據可靠方面消息，鄭氏已電平執行部，不日返平，並否認渠繼任軍統局長說。</p>
<p>〔本報北平二日電〕東北執行小組工作即可展開，中共小組組長饒漱石，耿飆，張德武，許光達率參謀電務人員等數十人，二日晨九時分乘美運輸機飛瀋陽。　　〔本報北平二日電〕國軍由瀋出發接收聲中，共軍似已開始破壞交通工作，據悉，吳家屯附近共軍破壞電綫甚多，本溪湖至瀋陽聞鐵路似有被完全破壞可能，軍事調處與交通小組之派遣，實刻不容緩。</p>
<p>〔本報北平二日電〕東北接收工作積極展開，東北行營最後一批人員，即將由秘書長胡家鼐率領于週內出關。經濟部東北特派員孫越琦抵錦後，以各收復區工廠礦山急待接收，亦電令在平技術工程接收人員全部出關，各員已于今晨起開始分批出發。</p>
<h3>哈市蘇軍撤退中　共軍夜襲長春已被擊退</h3>
<p>〔中央社哈爾濱二日電〕此間蘇軍連日撇退，市內情形頗爲平穩，共軍活動並未表面化，惟哈長間電話三日前突吿不通，目前仍未修復。</p>
<p>〔中央社長春二日電〕此間蘇軍最後撤退期，一般揣測可能在十日左右。</p>
<p>〔中央社長春二日電〕今晨保安第十三團之追擊部隊已於午刻返防，縱火者已遠逃無踪，據悉，昨晚來襲者係共軍，總數的五百餘衆，分向四處襲擊，其一即於縱火之處，該處地名爲綠園。又一處爲南嶺，其他二處在飛機塲附近，各處共軍今於拂曉時退去，又當雙方對戰時，蘇軍曾出動戰車六輛，由大同大街經過巡遊市郊一週，以資警戒。蘇城防司令部並曾派兵在市內巡邏，已與守衛執行之保安隊發生誤會者，即爲該項巡邏兵。</p>
<p>〔又電〕長春以南十九公里之大屯及靠山屯，昨晨甫經共軍攻佔，晚聞即有三數人來襲市郊，長春局勢已爲此突趨嚴重。又長春西部昨通宵有戰事，來襲者携有輕機槍多挺，第一槍發於晚一時四十五分（重慶時間），旋即有更多之槍聲，衝破雨夜沉寂。據官方所獲報吿，當時有來歷不明之部隊，在興安大路西站，興安橋至飛機塲之中途縱火，有原駐蘇軍之房屋兩柳被燃，保安第二總隊第十三團哨兵前往阻止，立即與縱火者發生接觸，雙方大隊出動，通宵對戰，直至拂曉，來襲者始被擊退。市區亦有數處鳴槍，行營及軍事代表團所在地之滿炭大樓，立即布置哨兵，準備應變，數以百計之保安團警，紛紛進入大樓四週之預設陣地，並有若干武裝部隊，登樓警戒時，一部份建築物之電燈，忽吿熄滅，半城陷於黑暗。昨夜之戰鬥，已使全市市民驚惶不寗，今晨街市見行人稀少，若干商店半拖其門。</p>
<h3>中英將撥款　建設北平市</h3>
<p>〔本報北平二日電〕中央即將撥款建設北平，熊市長自渝返平後，昨在市府紀念週報吿關於平市建設，如修整文物，翻修馬路，繼續建築新北京等項，中央即將撥款辦理。</p>
<h3>統一收復幣制　盼中共停發紙幣</h3>
<p>五次談判尙無結果</p>
<p>〔本報南京二日電〕政息，財政部爲統一幣制，安定收復區金融，以减輕人民痛苦，曾向政協三人委員會政府代表提供意見，曾由張羣·張治中先後與中共代表周恩來談判，商請中共勿再在共軍佔領區內發行紙幣，並撤消限制任用法幣之禁令。此項談判，聞已舉行五次，周恩來對原則表示同意，並已請示延安，惟延安方面迄今仍持延宕態度，因中共近正延伸其勢力於東北，利用時機，積極擴軍，軍費支出，日趨膨脹，已至無法遏制之境地。據可信估計，過去八年，中共印行之還抗券流通券等五種紙幣，其發行額可能已達三萬億元。</p>
<h3>參政員沉痛咱籲　勿又人已作政爭犧牲品　討論政協報告曾起波折</h3>
<p>〔本報重慶二日電〕今日下午四時三刻，參政會第一次大會爲討論政治協商會議報吿審查意見，故引起重大波折。緣該項審查書，由特三審查組草擬通過者，而提出大會時，文字已大加修正，大部份參政員認爲秘書處無權限可以擅改小組之審查書，而部秘書長否認爲任何主席團之命辦理，一時會塲上發言者此起彼落，達於最高潮，結果於五時四十分以後，將原審查宣讀後修正通過。某參政員鑒於政協會以後各處共軍不時仍有擾亂，特在討論政協報吿審查書時，起立作沉痛呼籲曰：政然要以國家民衆利益爲上，切不可以民作政爭工具，而把人民作犧牲品，博得全體掌聲不少。</p>
<p>〔本報重慶二日電〕二日下午四時參會通過行政院施政報吿審查意見，其中有言曰，宋院長所提出之開源節流辦法，謂即足以平衡預算，大會同仁不無疑慮。</p>
<h3>中紡公司職員　高薪之謎</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕上月二中全會開會時，潘委員公展吳委員紹澍等均曾問及中國紡織建設公司總經理及各級職員月薪問題，謂外傳二月份薪水有高至百萬元者，是否屬實。當時經濟部負責書面答覆，並附該公司職級薪俸對照表，辨稱：（甲）處長總稽核分公司經理總工程師支一至五級薪，即六〇〇至四二〇元，（乙）廠長支一至八級薪，即六〇〇元至三三〇元，（丙）副處長副總稽核副理支二至六級薪，即五五〇元至三九〇元，（丁）專門委員工程師支四至十一級薪，即四五〇元至二五〇元，（戊）秘書稽核課，師長專員辦事處主任支六至十五級薪技即三九〇元至一七〇元，（已）辦事處組長支十二至二十級薪，（庚）技術員辦事員支十三至廿二級薪，（辛）助理員支廿二至廿五級薪。按表（甲）據最高六〇〇元底薪者薪津合計僅得七五〇〇元，藉示般職員薪級並不甚高。但據記者從可靠方面探悉，總經理支八〇〇元底薪副總經理支七〇〇元底薪者，並不規定在此表之內，據又答覆，似有跡近搪塞之嫌。且在全會中散發之薪級表是否確實，究爲何月份者，尙有問題。因該公司二月份薪級表已規定（甲）處長級支六〇〇元者薪津併計可得二八二·二八六元，即支一〇〇元之辦事員亦可得八〇·〇一一元。可見經濟部向全會報吿最高薪給祇發七五。六〇〇元者完全不確。更查該公司二月份發薪乃按照上海市政府一月份公布之職員生活費總指數八九九倍作基本，然後比照核算。其指數津貼之核算方法，規定如下：（一）薪金八〇元，按指數發給（作爲基本津貼）。（二）薪金八〇元以下者，分別另加補給津貼：計薪金五〇·六〇·七〇元者各給予補給津貼三〇％，二〇％，一〇％。（三）薪金在八〇元以上者，除八〇元基本津貼外，其餘薪額概給予補給津貼四五％。上項指數津貼按上海市政府三五年一月份公佈之職昌生活費總指數爲八九九倍，則二月份指數津貼之算式爲（一）基本津貼即八九九乘本薪；（二）八〇元以下薪津即基本津貼加（基本津貼乘補給津貼），（三）八〇元以上薪津即基本津貼加（八九九乘四五％乘超過八〇元本薪數），即爲二月份發給指數津貼之薪津總額。由此推算，如該公司三月份發薪，依照市政府公布之二月份職員生活費總指數一四六四倍計算，則總經理支底薪八〇〇元者，常可得五十九萬二千二百五十六元之多，而該公司盈餘所發之花紅（即年終加發若干月之薪給）尙不計在內。無怪外傳中紡公司高級職員薪給有高至百萬元者，其眞相不難窺見一斑。此不僅使其他公敎人員聞之艷羨不止，即一般民營企業職工亦有望塵莫及之歎云</p>
<h3>本屆參政會圓滿團幕　駐會各委員選出　江庸述大會成就重視建國</h3>
<p>〔中央社重慶二日電〕參政會第四屆第二次大會，於二日下午七時圓滿閉幕。大會於上月廿日開始舉行，歷二星期，共開大會廿一次，通過議案達四百五十三件，爲歷屆大會所未有，閉幕式由主席團王世杰·吳貽芳·李璜·江庸·王雲五領導行禮，江庸主席致詞，謂：本次大會之成就，乃在重視建國工作，並具有極大信心，本次大會通過提案甚多，均着重（一）救濟收復區人民，安定民生，（二）改善財政，經濟政策，（三）澄淸吏治，（四）擁護實行和平民主。參政員陳裕光致詞，略謂：各參政員在此次會議中，對政府施政多加檢討與建議，已盡其責，所次議各案，常有利於政府之措施，並希望政府切實採擇施行。詞畢，大會在熱烈掌聲中閉幕。又參政會第四屆第二次大會閉會期問駐會委員會委員，於今第廿次會議中選出，名單如下：林虎·馬乘風·孔庚·錢公來·褚輔成·李璜·蘇珽·羅衡·傳斯年·彭革陳·何　鴻·榮照·席振鐸·武肇煦·范予遂·尹述賢·鄭揆一·伍純武·左舜生·王普涵·許孝炎·薛明劍·何春帆·劉眞如·陳啓天·董必武·胡霖·達浦生·甘家馨·汪寳瑄·張君勱等三十一人。</p>
<p>電謝馬帥及美軍</p>
<p>〔又電〕參政會今通過致馬歇爾將軍電及致駐華美軍電二件，原電如次：</p>
<p>致馬歇爾將軍電　馬歇爾將軍閣下，數月以來，閣下以最深之同情與最大之努力，協助我最高統帥克復戰後軍事上種種困難，匪惟有功於中美之邦交，抑實有功於中國之統一團結。本會同人來自全國各地，現値開會之中，對於閣下之熱心毅力及服務精神，同深欽佩，爰依大會決議，電致感謝之忱，中華民國國民參政會，民國卅五年四月二日。</p>

<h3>主持軍統局十四載　戴故局長功績彪炳　遣體有安葬南京紫金山麓說</h3>
<p>〔本報南京二日電〕戴笠將軍死訊公布後，戴之家屬已正式舉哀，京方即定期公祭，戴之靈體是否運回原籍，尙未定，因重慶消息有安葬紫金山麓說。戴之繼任人選，一度曾屬望康澤，康現在國外，聞月內即回國。</p>
<p>〔中央社重慶二日電〕軍統局自戴故局長主持以來，歷時十四載，對抗日工作貢獻殊大。茲誌其功績如次：戴局長所主持之軍統局工作，開始於九一八事變後民國二十一年四月一日，其工作乃爲三民主義革命而奮鬥，抗戰八年中，凡淪陷區內所佈置之情報與行動工作，對敵僞軍事政治經濟一般動態與陰謀之調查，及對敵之破壞與突擊，並敵僞軍政要員之制裁，與營救盟方飛行人員之出險，及調查敵後轟炸目標等項工作，均已盡其最大之勞力。</p>
<p>蒐集情報打擊敵軍</p>
<p>（一）情報方面，該局十四年來蒐集情報，據以呈供最高統帥及各有關軍事機關參攷。其中對國軍及盟軍對敵作戰裨益之處頗多，如三十四年三月，該局獲悉敵人將以七萬人之兵力進犯南陽老河口等地，幷詳悉集結豫南敵軍番號，素質與部署情况，最高統帥部事前根據此項情報，作適當之部署，卒予來犯之敵，以嚴重之打擊，曾由軍令部傳令嘉獎。又如該局因曾奉令與美方合作交換情報，故於三十三年十二月該局獲悉敵聯合艦隊，自經台灣及菲島海戰，遭受重創後，敵酋應田副武將殘餘海軍，集中琉球一帶，重行整編，任淸水光美爲第一體隊司令，以澎湖列島之鎭海要港爲基點，任松本益吉爲第二艦隊司令，以琉球羣島爲基點，三十四年一月七日美海軍即根據該項情報，襲擊琉球與台灣，擊沉大小敵艦八十三艘，幷毀敵機二百十架，事後美方曾函道謝。此外歷次湘北會戰，及各地戰役，該局亦曾獲得有價値之情報，以供最高統帥參攷。</p>
<p>抗戰八年行動統計</p>
<p>（二）行動方面，抗戰八年中，該局對敵破壞二千一百另七次，突擊五百八十五次，制裁敵僞首要五百十五次，敵僞人員死亡者一萬七千八百七十三人，負傷者四千九百十六人，俘獲者五百六十六人，毀敵軍機車四百九十二輛，車廂一千六百二十七節，汽車四百七十七輛，汽油二萬令三百二十箱，電機一千七百九十七部，電綫二千六百七十五公尺，機器十五部，船艦四百四十二艘，砲台及碉堡共五十一座，步馬機槍共二千三百一十八挺架，砲三十三門，各種彈藥四萬八千三百零箱，飛機七十一架，兵營一千五百七十八間，軍糧八萬一千四百六十二擔，電綫桿一千三百一十六根，軍服軍毯共五千五百五十件，毒瓦斯原料五千零五十一箱，橋樑二百五十座，路軌一千六百五十八公尺，鐵絲一萬九千九百二十四丈，煤油五百四十七箱，綢布五萬六千四百五十一疋，棉花七千六百七十包，並鹵獲戰利品甚多。至該局所指揮之別動軍忠義救國軍，曁中美合作所等對敵偽工作之成效，曾由美方披露報端，故不復祥。</p>
<p>奉令主持逮捕漢奸</p>
<p>（三）懲奸方面，抗戰勝利後，戴局長奉令主持逮捕漢奸工作，因認此事如辦理不善，非僅無以平公憤，抑有損國家之紀綱，民族之氣節，故常親赴收復區各重要地區，督飭所屬，認眞辦理，綜計已逮捕之漢奸共有三千四百五十五人，正依照處理漢奸案件條例第五條之規定，分别移送各地法院或軍事機關審辦。至漢奸財產，亦經會同有關機關予以查封淸查，並移交各地敵僞產業處理局處理中。戴局長此次由靑島飛京，墮機遇難，其此行北上，主要爲處理漢奸案件。以上所述係紀其梗槪。戴故局長及其所領導下之工作人員，在抗戰期中雖因公犧牲達四千餘人，而獲有上述成果，亦有其代價也。</p>
<h3>中央黨部　準備還都</h3>
<p>吳鐵城擬月中飛京</p>

<p>〔中央社重慶二日電〕渝京復員聯運線中之陜州洛陽段，經交部公路總局改善路面，並增加車輛聯運，全線今已暢通。另息，川陜公路局復員運輸，自四月一日起由渝出發車輛，每日由六輛增至十一輛，四月十日以後，每日可增至十五輛。</p>
<h3>工人埋頭修路　政府將予獎勵</h3>
<p>〔本報南京二日電〕交通界訊：龍海全錢可望於四月底前修竣，如無意外，五月五日即可由寳鷄直達連雲港。津浦修路工程，現每日可修二三公里不等，粤漢全綫通車，亦可能在今夏後實現，目前正竭力設法克復衡陽至韶關間之艱鉅工程之諸般困難。目前中國最苦，最勇敢，最忠於國家之工人，殆無過於修路之工人，渠等終日埋頭工作，已忘記物價，聞政府將予渠等優異之獎勵</p>

<h3>共黨青年黨意見衝突　政協小組商修憲　對省自治法雙方激烈爭辯</h3>
<p>〔本報重慶二日電〕政協綜合小組與憲草審議會，昨召開聯席會義，經二小時半之問談，修憲原則，已獲得朮大協議：（二）對於國大組織，各方面代炎司意有形國大，由立法院·監察院·縣代表·華僑代表·邊疆民族代表組成之。當時靑年黨代表提議應加入職業代表，因有雙重選舉之嫌，未爲各方採納。（二）立法院與行政院之關係問題，各方代表意，後者對前者負責，立法院通過之決議，如果認爲在執行上有困難情形者，總統得提交覆議，結果如有三分之二贊同維持原案時，行政院仍須執行，此項協議政府代表與中共代表，須向中央請示後方可作最後決定。（三）訂定省自治法，不爲各方所同意，常時靑年黨代表主張省自治法，須經立法院通過方可發生效力，遭受中共代表猛烈反對，青年黨代表憤然退席。時已薄暮，所有問題未決定，三日繼續商討</p>

<h3>美國之火箭武器　「小珍」及「聖摩西」威力最大</h3>

<p>社論</p>
<h3>日本已主化的障碍</h3>
<p>盟國對日管制委員會定於本月五日在東京舉行開幕會議，我國苜席代表朱世明中將一行，亦已於上月三十一日行抵東京。朱氏於離滬赴任前夕，曾向上海記者發表談話，對麥克阿瑟元帥統治日本政策，備加讚揚。原來自日本投降以來，麥帥即以盟軍統帥資格，進據日本，實施統治；他所代表的不僅是美國，還有其他對日作戰的盟邦。盟國對日管制委員會之成立，並不是監督麥帥的機構，乃是協助麥帥統治的一稱機關，集盟邦代表於一隅，原所以集思廣益；它的目的是在輔助而不在監督。過去關於統治日本，爲主要盟邦，特別是蘇聯與其它盟邦間所持的見解，往往有相當距離。今有盟國對日管制委員會之成立，各國代表可以有交換意見的機會，多少或者可以减少一些已往所有的距離。麥帥於過去七個月中任勞任怨，對日所施的統治實在應該爲世人所一致推崇。殘餘封建勢力的廓淸，財閥的解體，協助日本向民主化途中的行進，凡此所爲，都在促使戰敗日本能有一種民主的新生。茲當對日管制委員會即將首次集會之時，願就本問題略抒所見。</p>
<p>日本爲此次戰爭的禍首，今以戰敗受到管制，因而消失其參加國際活動的資格，此原是對侵略的禍首所應有的懲處，但從一個較遠的角度着眼此究爲一種爲時極暫的過渡。即使盟國管制日本需時三十年，五十年，乃至一百年，也終究有一個時候必須撤消此項管制。因此，盟國管制日本的是否成功，不在管制時間的久暫，而在管制的是否有效。管制的意義，與其說是在執行着一種司法上的判決，無寧說是在展施敎育。必使日本人民澈底改悔他們過去行爲的錯誤，明瞭他們的行爲究竟爲什麽有備誤，怎樣纔可以避免有再錯誤，有了這種澈底的自覺，然後纔能有日本的新生。麥帥之統治日本，過去側重在解除日本自覺的種種客觀障碍，如財閥的解體，殘餘封建勢力的剷除，這是使日本自覺的必要基礎。</p>
<p>據報載消息，北海道方面日人，近且蠢然思動，表示反抗盟軍的統治。此等謀變之徒的人數縱不致過多，或僅爲日本人民中的一極少部份，但旣有這種跡象，總是應該予以重視的。巧合的是北海道日人圖謀反叛的消息傳來時，德國的殘餘納粹，亦蠢然思有所動。據三月卅一日路透社柏林電，英美軍事情報處人員已發見有納粹團體，陰謀反叛。據佛朗克福所發另電，則謂英軍已在其占領區內，以數千聯軍將納粹秘密團體予以摧毁，當時雙方曾多處開火，宛如作戰。據美軍情報處長薛勃將軍稱：此項納粹秘密團體之目的，在實施納粹政略的第二階段，冀以巧妙方法於將來奪取政權。同一性質的團體，難免不存在於日本。防制日本侵略帝國思想的復活，並不單在剷除此類秘密團體。如果日本有這種團體存在，我們可以深信盟軍當局必然會採取有效揹施。但問題確是在另一方面。</p>
<p>這就是我們必將阻得日本民主化的兩種主要障礙儘先從根剷除：天皇制度與神追敎。天皇制度與神道敎若不剷除，則日本軍閥的「八纮一宇」的迷夢，這是在做的，正如納粹餘孽，死灰復燃，還想實施納粹政略的第二階段一樣。大西洋憲章雖曾提出宗敎自由，但日本的神道敎却是日本統治軍閥爲實施統治而製造出來的。此項宗敎旣爲日本統治者的一種政治工具，故對於日本的神道敎實不能適用宗敎自由的原則，應以外來勢力將之剷除；日本的皇室制度，亦須藉外來勢力來加以剷除。日本人民受皇室制度及神道敎的毒已深，他們本身似乎沒有力量來廊淸這種毒素。所以關於皇室制度及神道敎，我們不能聽任日本人民來自王。日本的憲法正在修改，如果這兩種毒素，實際上是二而一的毒素，不能根絕，那末憲法的修改也將等於具文。</p>
<p>對於廢止日本皇室，我國政府雖沒有明白的表示，但全國人民却有一致的認識。參加盟國日本管制委員會的我國代表，旣已抵任，深信必能將中國人民的意向表達出來。爲了中國乃至全世界的和平幸福計，我們不能容許日木侵略主義的復活。防制日本侵略主義的復活，就得以剷除天皇制度和神道敎爲先決條件。日本必須俟這兩兩種毒素肅淸後，始能眞正走向民主化的大道。</p>
<h3>美煤礦工人　開始總罷工</h3>

<h3>美軍在日行為　麥帥深表痛心</h3>
<p>特致函從軍收帥</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕東京二日廣播：盟軍最商統帥麥克阿瑟將軍，今日致函留日全體陸軍收師稱，渠最近接到美國家庭來信，對於報戰暗爪佔領軍隊與日本不貞女士所發生之雜亂關係，深表痛心。不幸一般人曲解「親睦」兩字之眞諦，而有種種不道德之行爲。今日本妓院及一切不名譽塲所，均已禁止軍人涉足，此乃自制問題，非發佈任何命令禁止軍人與日本人民斷絕社交關係所能奏效。此事旣不便實施，更不能解決問題，徒然有損美國軍人之自尊心與人權耳。</p>

<p>〔法國新聞社新德里一日電〕英國商務大臣克里浦斯，頃向報界談稱：英國訪印代表團此來，並非代表英國與印度進行談判，僅欲協助印度內部能獲得一致之意見，故此來主要目的，乃在從旁幫助印度制定新憲法，以完成獨立，至於印度之將來，悉在印人手中，英國政府一俟新憲法成立，即認爲任務終了，對於今後之發展，即不欲負任何責任，故在吾人離印返國時，即聽任印度獨立矣云，</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕記者頃訪糧食部長徐堪，徐方召集糧商代表等會議，不克分身，特命該部某重要職員代見。渠以肯定之語氣，對我國及上海糧政前途，表示極度樂觀。渠稱：部長此來任務，一在檢討軍糧及民食之供應狀况，視察該部業務，上呈宋院長，召集有關人員，共同研究糧食問題。二在努力疏暢米糧來源，預料天氣放晴之後，糧價必將步跌。本市米糧存底尙豐，來源亦暢，今後將再接再厲，使存底愈豐，來源更暢。故本市米糧前途，有跌無漲。據吿宋院長此次來滬，對糧食問題特予重視。除令充厚存底加暢來源外，對各省正常消費量以外之存糧，亦望能合理繳出。對數月前已付款之各省軍糧，則着催繳足額。據吿湖南之災情雖重，惟不如各方傳報之甚。現除該省軍糧，着應自行籌集外，其他各大軍區軍糧，該部已另作統籌辦法。關於「聯總」對我糧食之分配案，徐部長近有專電致送在美之我國「行總」署長蔣廷敝，內容注重兩點，即（二）通知中爾受災狀况，（二）對「聯總」予我糧食分配，有一最低要求之數字。最後據吿「聯總』之麵粉，日前曾停止發賣，頃已決定於一二日內，恢復繼續拋售辦法。此次拋售價格，將隨市略低，以杜絕黑市之猖獗，傳使粉價逐步下跌至合理水準。糧食部亦已向國外定購大批米糧及麵粉。聞第一批之麵粉，有十八萬袋，米糧確數未明。現已簽就購買契約，並即將結付外匯。聞徐部長自來滬後，曾迭召本市現有及過去之糧商，及地方有關人民舉行會議。對疏暢來源各問題，多所討論。</p>
<h3>已登記烟已不准移動戶口　本月十五又前　經規定為戶長檢舉時期　執行勒戒時醫院成問題</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕頃據總局消息：該局辦理烟民自新登記事宜，業於三月杪結束。迄昨日止，該局已有十七處分局彙報登記之人數，共有四千五百六十五人。其中以泰山分局登記之人數最多，計爲五百五十五人，尙有若干十分局登記之人數，未及送報總局。</p>
<p>據悉：本市烟民確數多少，向無統計，敵僞盤踞時期，僞禁烟局登記之烟民，約有一萬三千餘人。惟其中頗多爲領購配給烟而登記，間亦有一部份業吿遷地或死亡，故此數亦無法作準。聞警局對已登記之烟民。將飭令不准移動戶口，至該局派出之調查人員，均持有警局之正式公事爲憑，如有不省份子假冒敲詐，可扭交警局嚴辦。該局現正向市府請撥調騐經費一千七百餘萬元，以便調騐烟民烟毒。又四月一日起迄十五日止，兩週之時間內，警局規定爲戶畏檢舉本戶烟民之時期，過期如發現未登記之烟民，則戶長亦將受連坐處分。</p>
<p>又悉：警局對接收僞禁烟局時所得之烟土一百餘箱，本擬利用之以爲戒烟原料。惟該批烟土，常初由該局靜安寺分局警備司令部，憲兵團，及當地保甲長等，會同接收後，以偽禁烟局原址另有他用，該批烟土即經搬往警備司令部暫置，而搬遷時，發現有假烟十餘小包，故擬待此事解決後，警局方能斟酌利用云。</p>
<p>記者旋赴衛生局訪主管戒烟醫務當局，承吿：該局除令飭所屬各市立醫院注意推進戒烟事宜外，並已通知本市各公私立醫院及已領有開業執照之醫師，一體協助辦理。該局所屬各市立醫院，共有十單位，其小且有專事戒烟之市立戒烟醫院一所，地處橫浜路九〇七號。據稱目前該局對戒烟工作感到困難者有二點：一即缺乏麻醉劑，該局初擬自製麻醉劑戒烟藥品，後以衛生署令飭京滬兩地之戒烟藥品，應由衛生署製造，然後統籌分配，故作罷。二爲執行勒戒時，醫院頗感缺乏。據吿烟民之自動戒絕者必多，惟間亦有赤貧之烟民，勢須設法爲之免費戒絕，現該局正積極計劃此項戒烟醫院多所，加添床位，以期戒烟事宜，能推行順利云。</p>

<h3>本市臨時參議會昨開第四五次會議　對改善衛生掃除文盲　各參議員紛紛提質詢</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕上海市臨時參議會，昨晨九時一刻，舉行第四次大會。徐寄廎議長缺席，由副議長奚玉書代，參議員報到者共達四十人。馮有眞及沈春暉兩參議員，昨日上午代表該會參加已故趙參議員志游在呂班路天主敎堂之追思彌撒及盧家　公墓之葬禮。由衛生局局長兪松筠報後，即由各參議員提出詢問：</p>
<p>擴充免費病床有何補救辦法</p>
<p>徐參議員士浩起立稱：（一）醫院病床缺乏，如增加後而需付費，仍與平民無益，衛生局有何補救方法，擴充免費病床？（二）接收以來，已近七月，工作是否吿成，何以尙未接收第一市立醫院？又其他各院等能否加急進行？（三）李霍　症即將流行，有否準備防疫？希望在重慶所見到之慘劇不致在上海出演。（四）市上偽藥充斥，害人匪淺，應加嚴厲取締。周學湖謂：本市花柳病盛行，應速普遍免費檢騐，婦女生產仍多數按舊法，須設法推行合理方法，兒童因天花犧牲者，在半數以上，常特別注意。趙班斧痛述極司非而路冬令蔽寒所設備不合衛生，重慶遷返工人，被送到所內，叫他們如何活下去！勞工醫院要在三年內建設，未免太長，能否加倍努力，一年半內完成。醫生看病時，一副可怕而孔，病人豈敢走近，可否改善？水祥雲說：現在街道垃圾，比　售租界時多上幾倍，普通醫院僅有五個，平民醫院更少，請注意，淸潔工人，待遇亦要合理。沈豐提議淸除垃圾及糞便時間要提早，娟妓太多，應强迫治療，診療所要整頓。</p>
<p>DDT殺蟲劑不應放存倉庫</p>
<p>詹文滸要求DDT勿放在倉庫中，應普遍應用.檢騐僞藥僞酒之結果，應隨時公布.市立第一醫院何故未接收？葉風虎贊成DDT應大規模用飛機來洒射。抽水馬桶備而不通，更不衛生，通溝工作，可吾迅速解決？垃圾箱當配合用戶，力求便利。侯雋人詢問郊區學校函請衛生局種痘，爲何不去？衛生所應普遍設置。范才驥問：小沙渡路勞工醫院並非全爲勞工服務，收費又大，能吾改善？浦柬工廠林立，是否計劃設一勞工醫院？徐永祚要局長詳細報吿接教及未接收醫院，究有多少？是否可請善後救濟總署撥給床位。報戴要實行公娼此制度應否建立？陸惠民請求對婦嬰衛生及花柳病擴大宣傳。呂恩潭提議趕快取締庸醫及設備不合格之醫院，曹俊謂市郊垃圾，當澈底處理，酒吧，飲食館不應隨便張貼美軍指定食堂字樣“In　Bounds”。周斐成謂學校衛生，限於十四所太少，應予普遍進行。李灝主張藥品均需先經檢騐再供用。注意醫生護士職工態度。處理性病，有何有效辦法？</p>
<p>俞局長答覆</p>
<p>俞高局長繼作簡單答覆：病床不够由於（一）缺少房屋，曾向敵產處理局要求，亦無結果。（二）經費不够，建立勞工醫院，已擬具計劃，但經費不足，已呈請政府指撥。第一市立醫院在市中心，前日軍佔領後改爲陸軍醫院，經軍令部接收數度交涉未果。霍亂疫苗，可供應一百萬人之用，其他各地，所用各種疫苗，均由本局製造供應。時疫流行時，擬將所有市立醫院歸併一防疫醫院。街道里弄淸除，雖已費最大努力，但財力物資均感缺乏，以致未臻完善，決仍繼續辦理，以達到戰前狀態。如有伕役任意將糞便倒入溝渠，請報吿本局，立予撤職。通溝可函吿局方，即可派人淸除，以後淸除工作，務必提早至六時前完畢。工人待遇悉遵中央規定，現每人每月可得四萬一千元。滬東區，現有聖心醫院，爲工人診治，將來決再設建一勞工醫院。工人衛生診療所，已設有四所。小沙渡路勞工醫院非屬市辦，可加調查。蔽寒所亦非本局經辦，但昨日起已開始派員前往診治天花等各症。醫師，護士等能度決隨時督促糾正。學校衛生亦擬擴充。如收到來函，必可前往服務。DDT收到不多，並未存放倉庫。上海收復之初，即已由飛機洒射。如再欲舉行，必須與美軍當局商議。善後救濟總署計劃可撥給病床一千又，但尙未接到，現收到藥品有一部份盤尼西林及DDT，數量不多。其他有奶粉，斑疹傷寒藥品.强迫治療娼妓，甚爲贊同，俟藥品大量運到後，定可實行。酒吧所掛。“In　Bouods”牌已與美軍醫官數度交涉，共同調查。十二時一刻散會，其他詢問由書面答覆。</p>
<p>外人所辦學校是否加又管制</p>
<p>下午爲第五次大會，錢市長·何副市長·沈秘書長及徐寄會議長均出席。項秘書長權報吿收到提案共三十一件，市民意見書九件，請願書二件。敎育局副局長李熙謀報吿究畢後，各議員均相繼提出質詢：詹參議員文滸質問：報吿中有上海日木中學校，校址市中心松井通名，何以至今還未改正？大國民風度不能大到如此地步。敵僞時期中小學生所受奴化敎育，要趕快糾正。周斐成提出：（一）職業敎育應增加，與中等敎育規定比例。（二）學校儀器設備太不完備，應設法添加。（三）西童學校接收後，是否應以中國人的經費，來培植外國人子女，下學期擬吾停辦？寗夏路中法學堂並未接收，請調查。傳統先認爲敎育局人選方面，工作緊張，埋頭苦幹，均表欽佩。但提議：（一）調整敎職員待遇，敎員罷敎乃暗示學生不守紀律，影響學生人格，敎局是否應負責？尊師運動募捐養教員是否適當，應考慮。（二）對優良私立學校請求補助，不良私校應取締，有何計劃？（三）閘北學校應調查增加。沈春暉提議迅速掃除文盲，普遍設立學校。詹文滸再問：（一）本會會塲即是一法國學校，有吾接收？如不接受，何故？（二）敎育局計劃建立大規模博物館·圖書館·美術館等，若有此物資，固然是好，吾則能吾暫緩，而將物力財力，人力先用在掃除文育工作。（三）敎盲界淸苦情形，爲各人所同情　，一方面希望提高待遇，一而提議大會通過議案向本市各級敎員致敬。王冰起立表示同意。潘序倫請重視辦理補習學校。季灝要求局方補助私立學校經費，否則請考慮稍增學費以維持敎職員生活。何炳松問前聞本市擬建立羅斯福圖書館，有何計劃？</p>
<p>李副局長答復</p>
<p>李副局長即向各位答覆：松井通名字。報吿上未改，實係疏忽，欺甚。接收僞學校，學生均分別甄別試騐，再加以思想訓練。擴充職業敎育，早有此計劃，但必須顧及中學發展。儀器設備，有中央硏究院，在滬淪陷期間，儀器二千箱，寄存一英人處，現已取出，其中多數係初中所用儀器，但必須經敎育部核准方可分發，已呈請中。西童學校依理應照中國敎育方針辦理，但在過渡時期，仍依前進行。如美童公學，則全係美人自費舉辦，將來外人辦校，應做到由中國人監督地步。天主敎學校五十餘所，一部份已照中國制度。中法學堂，因產權不明，尙未接收。待遇方面，政府補助有限，或可酌量增加學費，但不宜過多同時貧苦學生，應給免費或半免。掃除文盲已有計劃，除已設各民衆班外，擬增設小學班一千六百班，本年內可增加兒童八萬人受學，成人班　千六百班，每班分兩次則即可增加十六萬人受敎育。答覆完畢，議長報吿今日上午第一組審查關於民政，自治，保安等事項委員會，及第三組審查關於敎育，文化等委員會，在大禮堂開會。第二組審查關於財政，經濟，建設等委員會，在休息室　開會。但新聞記者不得參加，下午則爲第六次大會，由地政局報吿。</p>

<h3>紗市依然不振　現棉交易亦減</h3>
<p>昨日紗市仍無生氣，緣客銷仍感不繼，僅南京及滬杭（綫有少數交易，小型廠急於吐出，不得不貶價遷就，如二十支雙鋒駱駝等牌，降至八十四萬，略有成交，二十支雙馬收市一百十一萬，又跌四萬，其餘各牌無不下落二三萬之譜，趨勢依然不振，紡建昨照例開售棉布及美國棉布。</p>
<p>昨日紐約美棉報漲廿五六磅音，計近遠期均爲美金三七。七九，米特林現貨二八·三四，木埠現棉市况堅穩，惟交易大形减色，緣外棉回漲頗勁，而一部份執有現貨之花商，不無扳價，是以談判不易接近，紡建公司亦存觀望，民營中新第二廠曾有購進，大中集似十萬二千，米特林價八萬三千，以上爲送廠價，花號進巴西花價七萬八至八萬元，以上爲棧交價云。</p>
<h3>呢羢定貨太增</h3>
<p>呢羢市面，昨仍平穩，標準售價，因貨底枯薄，中紡開出有升無降，兼皆秋冬所銷貨品，致難望賤，同業向英美及波蘭洋行定貨者大爲增加，如法蘭羢海列斯中西裝各式花呢嗶嘰海林棒等，定價每碼山美金三八角起至十五元止，定洋大半先付三成，裝船期分七八九三個月內，聞不付定洋之活洛開口定單，定者允夥</p>
<h3>茶市頹風未息</h3>
<p>運來歐美各國，需求華茶依然甚爲股切，然目前因新茶尙未登場，陳茶擱價多年，其品質終不免發生變　。已不適合彼地胃口，刻下國外篇聊應眉急起見，聞紐的車塲已向台灣及國外錫蘭。爪哇等地訂購紅茶的十餘萬磅，至於本市茶葉市况，本街及客帮之納胃均亟呆滯，惟一般獲利者貶售甚湧，總之在溫州明前新龍井即將開秤之際，同業間對於陳貨皆無意活動，致交易一蹶不振，市氣虛浮異常，而祁門茶疲風更熾，每擔竟跌進十二萬元內。</p>

<h3>白桐油浙路俏　漢桐尚平正</h3>
<p>白桐油因浙杭方面來源不旺，市面屢見起色，近日杭訊已增至七萬二三千元，杭交，然對外交易，亦祗售七萬四五千元，碼頭交貨，因是未能接近，惟最近漢口方面續有運到，數十桶至百餘桶，斷續而來，價格的七萬元光景，尙能合算，故出口去路絡繹，稍有交易，乃各號現在之目光，已捨浙桐而羣趨於漢桐矣，惟滬漢交通未見圓滑，蓋輸隻未齊，班期亦未規定，雖有來貨，總若斷若續，茍能航運恢復，來源當可較旺。</p>
<h3>平已福音　米價繼續回小　雜糧油餅均疲落</h3>

<h3>卜內門有派貨　燒碱開價低廉</h3>
<p>大批美貨燒碱到滬，外灘碼頭，幾排成一字長蛇陣，已誌昨報，茲聞內門洋行將有派貨，每桶祗需六萬元，較市價大爲便宜，故趨勢甚爲萎靡，但聞滬上存底甚薄，又加廠方需求量甚大，故雖有陸續到貨市勢或不致慘瀉云。</p>

<h3>收復瀋陽</h3>
<p>— 本報廿六日航訊　特派員韓清濤</p>
<p>購軍進駐城區後的瀋陽，市民們感到了輕鬆，『東北敵僞事業共產統一籌收委員會遼寗省分會」的接收委員們，也到達了二百多，並且緊張的展開了接收工作，氣象更爲之一新！</p>
<p>鐵西工廠的哀痛　鐵西區的工廠，是大家重視的一個目標，統一接收分會的工礦組，馬上派出人馬，前往調察，並作接收工作，在究整和殘破的廠房中、工作了一個星期，結果大家都感到了非常的痛心。</p>
<p>有幾處工廠的大烟囪在冒烟，其中有兩個啤酒廠，一個肥皂廠，肥皂廠的門口，懸揖着「秋林公司滿洲油脂廠」的招牌，有持槍的俄人在守護，不准接收人員進去，啤酒廠也標着「秋林洋行」的工廠。</p>
<p>廿多家不盡完整的工廠門前，懸掛着「興業企業公司」的大木牌，據說那是某人聯合“原有工廠廠主的傑作，這廿多家中，有的竟空無一人，剩餘東西，隨地棄置，有時被人拿走了。</p>
<p>有一個「電氣材料工廠」主要的機器，已被搬走，庫房尙有電氣材料，孩子們可以背着一袋子走，幾個某造紙廠的×人，推車到裏邊找造紙材料，還有一個「牽引車製造廠」，剩餘五金材料亦多，都需要武裝守護。</p>
<p>「漢洲化學工廠」一個做潤滑油，一個在造　，被「中長鐵路」接收了，派一個蘇聯人作廠長，日人副之，日人送了兩個日本女人，倍伴廠長玩樂，廠長五日不到廠，副廠長也不常在，結果失了火，損失很大、這是兩天前的事，餘燼尙未寒。</p>
<p>鐵西區工廠烟囱林立着，有的廠屋僅剩下了一個軀壳，完整或可能拚湊復工的工廠，又有這些糾紛，統一接收的人員正謀合理的解決，</p>
<p>爭奪產業與房屋　房屋和產業，等到統）接收分會派人去接收，門窗上已經有了兩三個封條，有的地方，則是「你貼我撕，我貼他撕』，敵人晴地笑，老百姓則爲祖國哭。</p>
<p>這些多是×事機關的作品，可是有人在問，他們爲什麽需要那些房屋？但一般人怎能弄淸楚這個問題，那只好大家糊塗了</p>
<p>好多的事業，也有好多非應辦的×事機關或××爭着接收事業塲所，大大小小，開始了業務、我們只好希望他們把「接收」的各事業部門，暂時好好的舉辦，將來作合理的讓出。</p>
<p>上海，南京等地的接收醜劇，竟也在瀋陽演出來，這實在更使人痛心，好在有人在批評，這要比關內好些，究竟好到了什麽程度，則無法估量。</p>
<p>行營，長官部，對于這個問題，已經在嚴重注意，除了約束部屬外，特將經濟，交通，有府等部門接收人員，組成了一個統一接收機關，那就是三月十六日在錦州成立的「東北敵偽事美資產統一接收委員會遼寧省分會」。</p>
<p>統一接收的組織，計有軍政，敎育，工礦，財政金融，社會，農林，交通，水利，司法，物產，內政，糧政，衛生，宣傳，救濟，監察，總務，會計等十八組，不過有些組人事還不健全。</p>
<p>瀋陽的老百姓，都在睜大了睛眼，看着統一接收分會的工作，希望能優美合理的達成任務，老百姓們對于中央派來的人，都非常的重視，他們表示歡迎，他們看來東北的人物偉大能力高强，我們怎能忍心叫他們失望！</p>
<p>可愛的老百姓　絕對大多數的人，在過份看重中央的一切，他們在暗地裏學習，誠心誠意的對待政府派來的人，這是隨時隨地可以看見的，對國軍更有熱烈的敬愛，國軍進城後，老百姓推斷必有大批國軍到達，所以一馬　一馬車拿着國旗的人，自動她向皇姑屯車站，歡迎國軍，這次國軍沿鐵道北進，鐵嶺一帶人民，都「待之如家人」，這種珍貴的愛，希望能長此下云。</p>
<p>在偽滿時代一般工作的人員，無諭如何，都要善加利用，原有事業機關的人，不能認爲完全不可靠，因爲他們愛祖國的熟情太高了，有時高過了僑胞過去所表現的一切，同時也知道的太多了，或者竟超過了接收人員，他們是最理想帮忙接收的人，而不是被接收的人們。　各部門接收人員，不能歧視原有員工，否則必有很大的損失，記者看到了他們的懷疑，聽到了他們的怨言，這一點情感邪工作上的陰霾，是必需消滅和明朗起來的。</p>
<p>東北的老百姓在熱愛着祖國，靑年的學生，爭着要從軍，氷雪壓不住高度的熟火，不合理的「接收」，是要把他們一張白紙般的腦子給染上了汚點，惹得他人笑，弄得自家哭，成功和失敗，都集聚在這一點上！（三月廿六日寄自瀋陽）</p>

<h3>留滬候船三月艱苦備嘗　細雨輕塵大基隆</h3>
<p>— 本報台灣廿一日航訊　統球寄</p>
<p>一個月來，陰雨連綿，控制着長江下游，上海不能例外，這好像老天爺給愛好享受的上海人爲難，大好春光，偏把你們悶在屋內，不能沈醉在大自然的懷拘裏。</p>
<p>可是最煩惱的，還是赴台工作人員，包括敎育處，工礦處，交通處，農林處，法院，善後救濟署，貿易局，資源委員會，郵電管理會，及台省各縣市政府等等各單位，除各主管及一部技術人員，搭機到台外，我們全部二千人左右，自從去年年底，受聘至滬，候船赴台，一候竟是三個月，把我們滿腔爲國效命的熱忱，一降再降，幾乎陷於失望。政府沒有船麽？海運未通麽？合　難道像　「柬北」了麽？事實答復我們都不是。我們知道台灣是十二分地需要着去整理建設，却一時不能去，相反的留在上海等閭。</p>
<p>吃盡當光　上海豈是普通人好混的，三個月間客飯，從每客一百漲到八百，旅館每天從五百漲到三千元，生活指數飛漲上六七倍，因此候船的同志們，距家近的，不斷回家取用。上海有有親友的，也一借再借。舉目無親的，眞是吃盡當光。雖然長官公署發過一筆安家費，供給過一筆預借費，然而十多萬塊錢，三個月來，個人費用當難支持如何還談得到安家？</p>
<p>宛如逃難　「山窮水盡疑無路柳暗花明又一邨」。我們失望於「海湘」「台北」「海宇」，却獲得了「海宙」。終於十八日登上船，十九日正午啓椗，四時半驶出了長江口。這個船是最近向美國買的，是十大自由輪之一，載重一萬噸。招商局接收以來，第一次駛行。而且本來是運貨船，現在改爲客船，一些談不到設備。二千多人悶在五個大統艙裏，被舖緊密相接，出人不得不彼此踐踏着，經過的被褥箱籠什貨，亂七八糟堆在舖位四周，動輒被人踢翻。好多同志大聲嚷着：「我們簡直在逃難，這不像個難民收容所嗎？</p>
<p>海景初賞　事實上，我們住着統艙，已是大幸，因爲有三十位，竟躱在甲板及走廊稍隱蔽之處。第一夜風雨交作，他們也只好嘗試着人類的原始生活，只有極少數的商人，居然「天之驕子」，以十萬元的代價，住上了五六間僅有的房船。</p>
<p>十九日夜風狂大，船身大爲振盪。二十日晨，却風平浪靜，中午陽光普照，映着碧綠的海水，點綴着羣的白鷗，一幅美麗的圖畫，實在太動人了，甲板上擠滿了人，或談笑，或飲食，或倚欄遠眺，好像一切苦惱全给忘了。</p>
<p>基隆在望　廿一最，船上人說：「今天中午可到了。果然，十時一過，台島隱隱在望，可是大公總給我們搗蛋，濛濛細雨，類個不止。霧氣氣籠罩着山和水，望遠鏡失了効力。十一時進入基隆口十二時泊岸，行程恰是四十八小時。基隆是一個極優良的軍港，一一一面環山，風景可與靑島媲美。碼頭上，各單位都有招待者，執着標織，情形很時熱烈。於是我們坐上台北縣政府的招待者顧票的四輛卡車向台北直駛而去。（三，廿　一。）</p>

<p>（三）獨立硏究院及大學硏究院之經費，應盡量增加，以資發展。至硏究生爲大學畢業生中之優秀份子，其待遇應與助敎相近，乃可安心向學，而現在待遇，助敎爲職員，月可得五萬元，研究生爲學生，月僅得膳費六千元。生活津貼一千五百元，此尙不足以果腹，應壽安定之術，旺附其向學之心。</p>
<p>（四）中等學校敎員之使命，不僅爲敎育靑年，且應使其逐漸進修，爲大學敎授之預備。但爲師範學院中設系過簡，或史地合系，或理化或博物合系等類，畢業生知識旣簡，絕無能力可以深造，大學附設之師範學院，有大學所設較完備之院系以爲調劑，自可免此弊病。至獨立之師範學院，則無此方便，必須寬撥經費，備設各糸，始能使畢業生知識完備，有深造之基礎。</p>
<p>（五）敵僞在東北設之大陸科學院，以東北之向然爲其硏究之對象，以東北之開發與利用爲其硏究之目的，包括地質，化學，工業，醫學，數十科目，彼此取得相互之聯繫，成一極有系統之組織，應由中央明令敎部改組爲國立東北研究院，保持其當日完整之精神。</p>
<p>（丁）社會教育</p>
<p>（一）推行社會教育之工具，莫良於廣播及電影，我國物資缺乏，收音機但供富人娛樂之用。偏僻省份，有若干縣不備一具者，消息阻隔，呎尺有若天涯，電影則僅大城市有之，鄉人終身未見銀幕者，不可以數計，如此而欲發展社會敎育”蓋屬至難。此後至望敎部注意此事，盡力推行，與無綫電器材廠特訂契約，務期以極廉之價，普遍發售收音機，並以實用科學知識，大最製造電影片，頒發於各處城鄉，輸流放映，庶國民悉能認識現代文化，並知其自身所負之責任。於話劇平劇，觀衆至多，尤應加以提倡或改良。</p>
<p>（二）科學發展，除應注重高深之硏究外，並常提高人民之科學知識水準，博物館以實物爲敎材，對於普及科學知識，收效最弘，應請敎部通令各省市政府凡人口百萬以上之都市，如南京，重慶，上海，北平，天津，廣州，瀋陽，應首先設立，其他諸處，逐漸推廣。　（三）我國文字，數以萬計，且多字畫繁雜，寫習不便，如不經過一次大整理於推行敎育，必感極大之困難，敎部雖已設有國語推行委員會，其任務偏重於推行注音符號及讀音之統一，整理字體之工作，尙未暇爲，然自清末以來，提倡問筆字者，實繁有徒，至今仍多專攻此問題者，欲求促進普及敎育，端宜接受其成果，共謀一標準化之途徑，應請教部從速召集專家，開國字整理會議，決定具體方案，如需有長時間之檢討，即設置國字整理委員會　（四）曲阜孔廟及奉祀官府所保存之鼎　祭器等，均爲我國文化無上壞寳，近聞中共軍隊佔據曲阜後，悉被取去，運往滕縣，數千年之文物，遭此浩刦，如不早日尋回，則損失之大，，將永遠無法補　，擬請敎部設法追回，予以保存。</p>
<p>（戊）邊疆與僑已教育</p>
<p>（一）邊民對於現代文化，過於隔閡任敎者如不習與俱化，人我兩忘，則將徒勞無功，入手之道首在通習其語言，達彼此之情感，各門功課均以用邊疆方言施敎爲原則。惟如何養成此項師拖人才，希望敎部早日計及。</p>
<p>（二）敎部已在各大學設置邊疆建設科目及講座，足以喚起內地及邊疆靑年對邊疆之注視，因屬切要，但窺豹一斑，尙不足以給有志深造者以滿足，尙望作擴充之準備，俾此諸校他日俱得成立專系或專科學梡，成爲硏究邊疆之中心。</p>
<p>（三）僑民愛國情殷，崇奉民族主義最切，故僑民敎育，應努力於本國史地智識及文化遺產之灌輸，使其情感得理智之指導。</p>
<p>（四）以往指導僑民敎育機關，未經統一，辦事多有困難，此後應由政府劃一辦理，俾有繩準。</p>
<p>（已）其他事項</p>
<p>（一）近日各政團多圖利用學生，作其政爭之工具，以致學生多荒棄學業，流人躁競之途，極堪痛心，擬請敎部嚴申禁令，無論任何政團，均不得在學校內作政治鬥爭，以免犧牲學生最可寳貴之求學光陰，學風漸肅，學生學業基礎乃有奠立之希望。</p>
<p>（二）每一敎師之收入，除供給生活所需之外，尙須購覓參考硏究資料及作學術旅行，非一般公務人但須辦事者比。目前物價飛漲，不但修學之事，無從說起，即最低生活，亦益難維持，應請政府比照物價指數，切實改進待遇。</p>
<p>（三）國家設學校教育人才，而又仿照私立學校之例，征收學費，實屬不當。近日雖在實際上多已不收，然一旣無明令廢除，偏僻省縣容有沿　慣例繼續取費者，則有遠均一，殊非爲政之道，擬請敎育部通令全國國立及公立之各級學校，均不得再征收學費。至於私立學校，亦應斟酌各地情形，限制其學費之最高額。</p>
<p>（四）國際間文化合作，首應注意人選，儿派至歐美講學者，應特別注重於我國固有文化之發揚。至自然科學方面，必須有充分之硏究，確有發明者，方得派任講學工作。（中央社，重慶，一日電。全文完。）</p>
<p>宜昌水閘設計草圖</p>
<p>宜昌水閘，爲空前的巨大工程，同時是我國重建長江流域計劃中最大設施。此一水閘，一旦完成，對於水利（包括洪水管制及灌溉，水力）與農利方面，即可收宏效。此項設計及工程　，已由我政府與美政府“立合同，聞不久將開始進行。圖中白線所示，爲擊山而築成之發電廠，長江之水將由蓄水池方面經隧這而注入發電廠、然後貫注於長江幹流及其兩旁之支流。</p>
<h3>陳逆公博　開審前一鱗半爪</h3>
<p>— 本報蘇州卅日訊　通訊員青萍寄</p>
<p>叛國巨奸陳逆公博，在日軍壓境之秋，竟不以國家爲重，不以民族爲懷，祗顧一時個人的福利，甘心與汪逆兆銘通敵叛國，勾結“寇，幹那賣國求榮遺臭萬年的漢奸勾當，歷任僞府立法院長，偽黨部中央委員，僞上海市長，最後達到他最大的慾望，而任偽國府主席。可是在他任僞職的期內，無一政令不是賣國，害民，他的十大罪狀，已由高檢處的首席檢察官韓燾，於本月十八日向高院刑庭提起公訴，並已由孫院長定於四月五日下午一時公開審理。在審理之前，關於他的一鱗牛爪，摭拾在下面；</p>
<p>懲治漢奸，原爲以振國風，而警世人。可是陳逆公傳，是一個罪大惡極叛國的巨奸，他不惜出賣國家，出賣民族，這次受國家法律的制裁也是罪有應得。所以中央宣傳部，爲要普遍宣傳，以警世人，特派中央電影製片公司，將陳逆的審訊情形，拍攝電影，放映各地。法庭上拍電影，在我國要算以陳逆爲嚆矢，將來使中外各地的民衆們，也可一睹陳逆的廬山眞面目了。</p>
<p>這件叛國的巨案，轟動了中外，這次在蘇州由江蘇高等法院開審，高院方面。事前特加以嚴密的佈置，爲了避免發生意外，維持法庭秩序，斟酌法庭容納旁聽者的數量，所以祗準備發旁聽兩百張，計京滬綫各報記者五十六張，其餘爲各機關官長，該院以券額有限，必須事前函請登記，二十八日起，已開始發給了，以發完爲止。據楊書記官長對記者云是日有外資觀審，院方於開審時，希望旁聽者必須嚴格遵守旁聽規則，以維持法庭的尊嚴，而表現我大國民嚴守公共秩序的風度。</p>
<p>陳逆公博，此次審理的法官，由孫高院長鴻霖，親任審判長，石庭長美瑜，爲主任推事，孔庭長容照，爲陪席推事，書記官秦道立，蔡一亭二人，任紀錄。高院對于新聞記者，顧慮得最爲周密，爲使記者聽得淸楚，便于紀錄，所以將新聞記者席，設在法臺的兩旁，這次審訊的時候，固然戒備森嚴，無旁聽券者，絕對拒絕入庭。法院特備汽車一輛將陳逆押入法庭，以便受審。</p>
<p>圖示爲等法院第一法庭陳逆公博受審時佈置之情形</p>
<h3>鹽政總局來函</h3>
<p>三月七日　貴報社論，其中有涉及鹽政部份。謹就事實分別闡釋於下，敬希惠察。貴報謂：「各地鹽價增高，到處鬧着鹽荒，而產地的鹽產却不能外銷，以致鹽民率多放棄製鹽，轉就別業。』此或爲敵僞時期鹽政之寫照。勝利以後，沿海產區函謀復員，本局除依照旣定方針，開放銷市，獎勵自由販運，使任何商民均得赴場或集散要點之倉場，照章購應運銷外，同時又以沿江各省，失地收復，銷區擴展，需要鹽量激增，乃於上海成立督運處，官商合力，積極疏運閩浙淮魯等區塲鹽，集中上海，視銷區之需求，分別轉運接濟。目前凡在本局管轄範圍以內，尚未聞有缺鹽致荒情。至因政治情形。于因政治情况特殊本機關尚未接管之場地，設有「鹽產不能外銷，鹽已轉就別業」之事，其責任自未便代負，應請翔實考察，又明真相。。其交，鹽價之增漲，純係受一般物價增漲之影響，然其增進指數，實在一般物價之下，其增漲比率，亦不若一般物價波動之劇烈。即以食米而言，戰前于京滬一帶食米每石及食鹽每担均約需十餘元，現京市食米每石則爲二萬四千元，計增二千餘倍，食鹽每担一萬入千元，計增一千餘倍。若再就人民負担計算，普通每人每月的需食米卅餘斤，計約六千元，食鹽約需十二兩，計僅一百餘元，兩相比校，其於民生之關係如何，不言可喩。若再進而分析鹽價增漲之因素，則知鹽價組合，除鹽稅征額多寡，有關整個國計，無待申述外，大部份則爲監本及運雜費用，而此兩項又莫不與一股物價息息相關。已往敵偽核給鹽本運費，儘量壓低，惟以剝削爲務，鹽民運伕均因難維生計，相率逃避，「轉就別業」。現則統籌兼顧，一面不使盬價過高，加重人民負担，一面依照物價增漲指數，隨時予以合理調整，俾能維持最低生活。茲值物價普遍高漲之時，鹽價旣無法單獨降低，衝情度理，似亦未可單獨苛求於鹽價。至貴報所謂：「我們傳統的行鹽制度」，當係指明淸相沿以來之專商引岸制度而言。此項制度，正如貴報所云，「從中覇特，不許人民自由買賣」，其特點在於籠斷市場，獨佔厚利，其流弊在於抬高鹽價，攙和雜質，妨碍多數人民生活。自明萬曆以來，貽毒於社會三百餘年，久爲國人所詬病。迨二十年中央予以澈底革新，於是年一月一日公布所有過去專商引岸及其他類似獨佔鹽業之特殊待遇及權益，即日一律廢除。勝利以後，在收復區內殘餘之此項不良「傳統制度」自應依法取締，廓淸積弊。按照現行之鹽政綱領，概由民製民運民銷，一切還之於民，任何人繳足稅款後，均得自由運銷，不加限制。此項主張，完全以民生主義爲依歸，將整個行鹽制度，公開於大衆，惟在推行伊始，誠恐社會尙有未盡瞭解之處，仍祈貴報廣爲宜揚，俾收宏效。此致申報館財政部鹽政總局啓。</p>

<p>春秋</p>
<h3>柳媽</h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>我想起韶光帶走了的童年，立刻就想起了柳媽，　有着金子一樣好心腸的三河縣的老媽子，是我童年回憶裏最不能忘懷的個人</p>
<p>在我三歲半那年，她到我們家來當佣人，起先是領我，後來領大妹妹，再後來是小妹妹，弟弟出世後，她又帮着奶媽照顧了一陣子，才離開了我們。</p>
<p>新門路近口的地方，好像有塊大青石，那是柳奶領我玩的惟一去處，為的是怕母親不放心，所以不敢走得遠。差不多是每天，（有風雨的日子自然除外），當　煌的太陽照滿了一地的時侯，柳媽作完了早事，領着我上大街，就在那大青石上坐着，请故典，說笑話，看街上的洋车，跟走道的路人；我的頭髮被風吹亂，她就　我梳小　。有時候我不安份起來，吹糖人的走過時，我要買；呌賣小雜食的走過時，我要吃，揑麵人的走過時，我要玩。柳媽身上沒帶子兒（就是銅子的意思），不能滿足我的希望，我就不依，她說家去拿吧！我却又怕母親罵不肯回家，她身上沒錢，我一定要買，吵得無可奈何，柳媽就說：「小蘑菇頭子啊！行行好吧！我要找歪脖兒樹上吊去啦！」招得大街上的人全都笑了。</p>
<p>不滿四足歲，母親就每天教我認兩例方塊字，母親太忙的時候，總由柳媽代教，那時候我以為凡是大人都是識字的。一直到再大幾年，才知道別的底下人並不像柳媽一樣的能認識字，她的父覜是三何縣鄉下的私熟先生。</p>
<p>後來我認識的字逐漸多起來，有時候我去問她，她說不認識，我覺得奇怪，柳媽說：「我爹嫌我是第五個閨女，養到九歲，把我給外婆家了，後來此沒人教我書。」言下大有身世之感的樣子。</p>
<p>她使我　成許多良好的習慣：不咬手指甲，不剩飯盌，人家說話時千萬別打岔，晚飯後撕去今天的日曆，隨手關門，滅了電燈睡覺，用凉水漱口；……如果這些良好的習慣我至今尚能保持，我得惑激柳媽。</p>
<p>記得有一次我用謊話騙了母親，後來被柳媽說穿了，母親罰我跪了足足兩個鐘點，我恨透了她，跟她又哭又鬧，她說：「七歲的孩子就撒謊，長大了還有誰相信你？」</p>
<p>那時候妹妹們也都相繼斷了奶，我入學讀書了，她和另外一個出媽照顧着她們；田螞是個做事不負責任的人，所以柳媽時時留心着兩個孩子。</p>
<p>我在錢糧胡同口對過一家教會中學的附小裏念書，天天下午散學，柳媽就推了小孩車在門口等我？妹妹們坐在小孩車裏，我把綴着黑字的鵝黃書包掛在車柄上，帮着她一同推了車子回家。有時候我嘛着要吃豆汁，柳媽立刻用手指頭括着臉蛋兒道：「不害躁，野小子才坐在小攤上吃東西哪！您是大閨女呀！」我只好拉倒了。</p>
<p>她教我用鳳仙花汁染指甲，可是我不喜歡；我喜歡的是帮着車夫韓三　爹爹擦包車，擦得　亮，照得是人，我又愛那股子汕味；柳媽笑我生成　小子，沒有一點姑妨樣兒。她還教我做活挑狗牙，拉鎖子，但是我沒有一樣學得會，終于她嘆了一口氣，搖搖頭，為我縫了一個嬋形的綠布針扎，我至今尚留着作為紀念。</p>
<p>我的那個學堂既是教會辦的，所以每禮拜天也要去做禮拜，先生們講的道理不能引起我的興趣，我愛聽柳媽每晚說白連教的故事，於是告訴她道：「耶穌教不好玩，我情願信自連教，我要會呼風喚雨，站在手帕上像駕雲。她慎重的告訴我不可以，因為白連教是邪教，正派人不可以信邪教。什麼呌邪教我那時候並不明白，但是「正派人」三個字深深印入我的腦海，我知道應該作一個正派人。</p>
<p>柳媽沒有男孩，只有兩個閨女，大的比我大四歲，給人家作童養媳了，小的和我同年，名叫鳳妞，白凈的臉蛋兒，有着和她媽媽一樣的一雙細而長的眼睛，笑起來像初三四的月牙。不過鳳妞沒有　足。</p>
<p>有一次，家裏來了一個大兵，挺高的個子，又給實；他和柳媽說話，口氣很不好聽，他走了之後，柳媽哭了一場。田媽說那個大兵就是柳媽的丈夫，柳殿霖，一個不務正業的人，柳媽嫁他的時候，他是個趕大車酌，後來不知怎麼當兵去了，家裏什麽事都不管，除了跟女人要錢時才回來。</p>
<p>我們要回南了，母親喜歡柳媽的忠實，細心，又靠得住；打算帶她南來，起先她不肯，因為捨不得孩子，後來柳殿霖又來要過一次錢，她還挨了打，那年夏天，她把小女兒鳳妞也給人家作童養媳，決計跟我們一起到南方來了。</p>
<p>起先她很想家，惦記着剛到人家作童養媳的鳳妞；並且也不太過得慣南邊的生活，我們常吃包餃子，撐麵，烙餅跟烙合子，但仍是減不了她的鄉思，她常說：「現在要瞧一所四合院的房子都難了。」又道：「逢九逢十，要是在北京，該　隆福寺去啦」！我跟她也有着同感，因為沒有一趟我到隆福寺不是她陪着我去的。</p>
<p>柳媽　　官語不通的時候，就愛嘰咕着：「好笨的南蠻子，還笑人北棒子哪」！——平心說，那時候北京話在南方可沒有現在普遍。</p>
<p>她儘管不滿意南方，然而從來沒有說過一聲要回去，或是後悔跟着來的；後來，漸漸的住得慣了，思家的心也就不似往常那樣切了。——一直到我十五歲那年，柳殿霖找到南方來，一完要她回去，她才依依不捨的離開了我們。</p>
<p>臨走的時候，她送給我們姊弟四人每人一件禮物，連夜趕着織成一件頭繩小坎肩，是給弟弟的，妹妹們每人一副銀手鐲，她給我一個銀頂針兒：「十五歲了，應該會用這個啦」！——我很慚愧，因為至今我還是不會用那玩意兒。</p>
<p>從她走後，到現在，也許是到永遠的將來，我們家沒有僱到過一個比她更好的女僕。母親常嘆息着：「有她在，不覺得，她走了，我操雙倍的心都不止。「她在我們家一共將近有十二年的時俟，在這人心不占的時代，十二年長久的朋友都少見，別說還是十二年的主僕。呌人怎不惦念呢？這樣一個善良，忠厚，好心的老媽子。</p>
<p>本來她還找代寫信來，自從「七七」事變以後，就不再有音訊了，如今柳媽是活着？還是已經不在這個世界上？我們郡無從知道，前些年也發過一回獃，寄封雙掛號到三河縣去，但是原件退回了。就是我們現在到了北京，又有什麼法子呢？</p>
<p>我的嶺子裏至今還藏着她送給我的頂針兒，綠布製成的蟬形針扎，每逢次看到這兩樣東西，我的眼睛裏不由自主的就會滿是淚水，晶瑩的淚光中，似科漾出柳媽的白淨的溫和的臉，細而長的一雙眼睛，笑起來像初三四的月牙……但是她在那裏呢？如果她今日還活着的話，她也會招到那個坐在新門路口大青石上的孩子，曾經獲得她要找歪脖兒樹上吊的孩子，正在想念着她當日的嘉言和懿行嗎？</p>
<h3>書憤四章　時久客渝州</h3>
<p>— 魯莽</p>
<p>萬里遷流嗟獨客，八年鋒鎬寄餘生，何堪倚柱魚彈　，無奈風鳴鳥　箏。</p>
<p>輾夢無憑未解醒，任他風雨弄陰晴、尋常一上高樓望，欲撥雲烟認故城。</p>
<p>入眼繁華未是安，新來光景不成歡，拼將熱淚穿紅海，芻狗蒼生一例　。</p>
<p>得失文章執計功，可憐小技試雛蟲，長歌祇合鳴抵憐，更與何人論信忠。</p>
<h3>山城一宿</h3>
<p>— 凌星</p>
<p>在洋場裏住得太久，就會歡喜山城的淳僕，常常懷着這樣的心情，在津浦路的旅程上，我喜歡在山城下車，睏在茅土屋的土坑上過一夜，拋棄一切勾心鬥角的困擾，彷彿在百忙中獲得一點讀唐詩的餘暇。</p>
<p>這一次，其實祗在山城中一夜勾留，並且是因為路軌出事，火車不能行駛，被迫留下的。但却種下了長遠的憶念，長遠的愉悅。因為，在人間又找尋到溫厚，　，在洋場中許多發掘人性的學者沒有找到，却讓我意外的在山城中輕易的尋獲了。</p>
<p>火車中很擁擠，下面還有更漫長的旅途，就更不情願在火車中過夜了。車站周圍的旅店已經客滿，我便順着大路徜下去。路上，坐在石階上吸旱烟的老者，用着詫異的眼望着我這遠方來的旅客笑着說：</p>
<p>「找不到宿處了，　？」</p>
<p>我苦笑一下，看見那佈滿皺紋的臉上熠熠的閃出溫厚的光。在別處我沒有看見過，幼年坐在熟師的背後讀「桃花源記」却仿彿似之。我用着一種由心底裏起的敬慕的心情問：</p>
<p>「老太爺」什麽地方有旅店麽？」</p>
<p>他天真的笑着，用那雙乾癟的老手拍拍身上的土說：</p>
<p>「這裏原來沒有多少客店，火車一停早住滿了。」</p>
<p>接着他嘆一口氣！</p>
<p>「這年頭，出門人難啊，也難怪你們，年青人不出來奔做啥啊？那像我，老得祇好抽袋烟了。」</p>
<p>我就是這樣被讓到老人家的家裏。坐在他那間草堂的方桌旁邊，心裏有一點不安，幾句客氣話囁嚅在嘴邊，老人家已經　出去了。口裏還在喊：</p>
<p>「你坐啊，你坐啊；」</p>
<p>我一個人坐在草堂裏，想起這倒有些像在京戰中的「捉放」，陳宮在路上遇見呂伯奢，老人家一定是出門沽酒去了。那麽廚房裏是不是也有「綁而殺之，綑而殺之」呢？</p>
<p>老人家回來，手中却沒酒，一盤燒鷄，兩隻燒餅，兩隻手一推：</p>
<p>「吃點吧，我叫他們燒點子小米粥，行路人應該吃點稀的！」</p>
<p>我僅說這一點其實也够了，相信淳厚一定廣泛的存在人間，冷酷一定沒有溫暖多。因為翻開地圖看，在中國廣漠的大地上離開洋場，便是不計數量的小城鄉鎮。</p>
<p>在山城的土坑上睏了一個極酣適的覺，一直到第二天的清晨，火車頭在嗚叫着召喚的汽笛。老人家來把我推醒：</p>
<p>「好趕路了，可惜不能多留你住兩天！」</p>
<p>他殷勤的送我上車，眼巴巴的望着車輛遠去，我，在擁擠中由車窗外望，老人家在晨風中飄颯着白髪，漸漸的淡漠，又有了一個老年誠樸的影子撲上。</p>
<p>山城裏的妤心人呵，願上天祝福你們！</p>
<h3>詩人楊雲史（二續）</h3>
<p>— 湯立言</p>
<p>可想其春風得意時也。又美美　　紅梅屏幛，春雨徹夜，為繪四幅，兼題八絕句云。</p>
<p>護屏山吹雨絲，正人相並弄胭脂，江郎彩筆狂猶昔，盡了長　畫折枝。</p>
<p>折得寒香烟滿湖，孤山蘇小伴林道。羊羔兒酒銷　帳，抵得清狂小宋無？</p>
<p>迷香洞裏春如海，猩色屏前見絲華。看慣上陽萬格調，一生悲喜為梅花。</p>
<p>王恭步雪儘風流。姑射仙人下十洲。昨夜春寒眠不得，自披　　擁貂裘。</p>
<p>太　詩骨似冰清。雨雪春燈憶玉京。　炬兩行書院去，大香花氣不分明。</p>
<p>睡醒羅浮三兩枝。看花最好未開時。縱教堪折不須折，留與東風好護持。</p>
<p>春來心事惜芳菲。花滿江城酒滿衣。一目新詩傳萬口，家家紅粉說楊圻。</p>
<p>湖海元龍萬里身。掉頭四顧出風塵。近來英氣消磨盡，只畫梅花贈美人。</p>
<p>蓋先生寗梅，頗自務惜。除吳吳公一百幅外，僅為美美畫屏而已。其他如春江送別，折柳曲，蹲躅詞，無題，沉醉諸詩，均為美美而作。其　句如「夜半入門人已醉，手扶花影下雕鞍。」「酒後春寒行不得，軍中刁斗已三更。」「何因軟語甜如蜜，皓齒無聲　荔枝。」等句，均香　入骨。因之風流小杜之名。海內皆知。忌之者遂呼先生為　門才子。時先生年已五十有二，既非年少潘郎，亦無石崇金谷。而美閏傾心相事，則其人固不俗，觀歷次索盡梅花司知也。未幾，吳公兵敗，先生倉皇離漢，美美盡力調度，始得脫險。先生既作留別之詩，瀕行阿美再索書梅。為題四絕之二。（未完）</p>
<h3>雙宿雙飛（二三）</h3>
<p>— 趙清閣</p>
<p>翁老爺說罷，滿滿乾了一大杯酒。這是他從來未有的　飲。</p>
<p>「可是，老弟！咱們家也有女子呀！」墨老爺用憂鬱的聲音較明朗地說。</p>
<p>翁老爺這次沒搭腔，他的手忽然燦　地顫動了一下，險些兒把正在斟酒的杯子砸了。</p>
<p>「老弟，我想，咱們不能就這樣裝糊塗，放縱她們下去，總得管教她們一下才行。因為，外面講的雖是她們，而丟臉的却是咱們呀！」馬老爺更澈底些說。</p>
<p>翁老爺苦笑了笑，聳聳肩，依然不開口。</p>
<p>「您是怕她嗎？」墨者　　不住這樣問。</p>
<p>翁老爺搖搖頭。</p>
<p>「那麼應有什麼意見呢？」</p>
<p>翁老爺被墨老爺逼得不能不回答了，於是他笑着說：</p>
<p>「我沒有意見，可也並非怕她。我確實不曾聽見　外面有什麽閒話，我也不願去聞問。為的是我　想多活幾年啊，大哥·什麼東西還能比自己的生命更值得姑息的呢？所以，不但波如此，並且我也勸您如此。　忘了，如今是維新世界呀！皇帝都廢了，還要那些舊規矩舊禮節作什麽？咱們既保不了皇帝的　，才弄到這般田地。自己的爵祿財產都完了，這些鷄毛蒜皮的小事又算什麼？能裝糊塗，還是裝裝糊塗好。」翁老爺說罷又喝了一大杯酒。</p>
<p>墨老爺聽着翁老爺的話也有道理。再說，人家的事究竟不宜過分的千涉。因此，也就停止辦下去了。</p>
<p>「喝酒吧，大哥！現如今咱們只有這樣，才能活得有興緻。聽我的話，此後您就在杯中尋快樂；我就在床上熬歲月，別人吃鷄子，看戲；讓他去。養生之道，是要少管閒事，少哎閒氣。」翁老爺設罷，仰天　了一口氣。</p>
<p>墨老爺心裏雖不太以翁老爺的話為然，可是他看出翁老爺的臉上，多少露出一些被壓抑的　　的情緒。他朋白翁老爺是不願意人家把他那霧的氛圍冲散，「霧」，變成了他生命的屏障。他佩服翁老爺的聰明，可是他就不能以醉為生命的屏障，他常常會自己又突破了「醉」的境界！好像他不安於長久　　在醉的朦朧裏！</p>
<p>所以，翁老爺是幸福的；墨老爺是痛苦的！</p>
<p>翁老爺已經忘記了剛才所談的一切似的。他又恢復了輕鬆愉快的心倩，漫然談着那些過去富貴浮雲的往事；談着風雨之變的政治，談着飄忽苑如流水落花的人情；他霧一般興邀地訴說這一切，他仰止訴說一個捉摸不住的曲折而又玄妙的霧底故事！</p>
<p>「一切都像夢，也是夢！　喻您生產華姪女的那一天，不是就作了一個與事實類似的夢嗎？所以人生就是夢，夢就是人生。從前我還不大明白這個問題，記得六年前，我勸過您不要作夢了。殊不知，人就是活在夢裏！除非人死了，夢也便醒了，沒有了。但是，既然知道人生就是夢，那麼就應該把一切當作夢看。夢是不會太久的，因此凡事大可不必太認真。能這樣，人活着就不會苦惱。</p>
<p>翁老爺最後用說教的神氣，講究一遍「夢」話，然後打了幾個呵欠，又回到他的霧生涯裏了</p>
<p>墨老爺如今却像翁老爺　才來的時候，那樣緘默了！他一語不發地只靜靜飲酒，她又暫時苟安在醉裏！</p>

<h3>Zhou Enlai Visits Gillen for Talks; Northeast Group Begins Work; Mining Technicians Leave in Batches</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Chongqing, 2nd] It is reported that Zhou Enlai met with General Gillen, Marshall's representative, yesterday to discuss the cessation of conflict. The government representatives for the three-person meeting have not yet been decided. It is rumored that General Chen Cheng is most likely to be appointed as a representative.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 2nd] The work of the Military Mediation Executive Headquarters has become slightly more tense than in the previous two weeks, but among the three commissioners, only the American Robertson has returned to Beiping from Chongqing to maintain normal work. Ye Jianying has been ill in bed for three days and has not gone to the headquarters to work. Zheng Jieliang has also not returned to Beiping. However, according to reliable sources, Zheng has telegraphed the Beiping Executive Headquarters, stating that he will return to Beiping soon, and denying rumors that he will succeed as the head of the Military Statistics Bureau.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 2nd] The Northeast Executive Group is about to begin its work. The CCP group leader, Rao Shushi, along with Geng Biao, Zhang Dewu, Xu Guangda, and dozens of staff members including staff officers and telecommunications personnel, flew to Shenyang on American transport planes at 9:00 AM on the 2nd. [Our Newspaper, Beiping, 2nd] As the National Army prepares to depart from Shenyang to take over, the Communist Army seems to have begun sabotaging transportation. It is reported that the Communist Army has destroyed many power lines near Wujiatun. It is rumored that the railway from Benxihu to Shenyang might be completely destroyed. The dispatch of the Military Mediation and Transportation Groups is extremely urgent.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 2nd] The takeover work in the Northeast is actively underway. The last batch of personnel from the Northeast Headquarters, led by Secretary-General Hu Jianai, will leave for the Northeast within the week. Sun Yueqi, the Special Commissioner of the Ministry of Economic Affairs to the Northeast, upon arriving in Jinzhou, urgently telegraphed to the technical and engineering personnel in Beiping to leave for the Northeast to take over the factories and mines in the recovered areas, which are in dire need of takeover. The personnel have already begun to depart in batches this morning.</p>
<h3>Soviet Troops Withdrawing from Harbin; Communist Army Night Attack on Changchun Repelled</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Harbin, 2nd] Soviet troops here have been withdrawing in recent days, and the situation in the city is quite stable. Communist Army activities have not become obvious. However, the telephone line between Harbin and Changchun suddenly went out of service three days ago and has not yet been repaired.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Changchun, 2nd] The general consensus here is that the final withdrawal of Soviet troops will likely be around the 10th.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Changchun, 2nd] This morning, the chasing troops of the 13th Security Regiment returned to defense at noon. The arsonists have fled far away. It is reported that the attackers last night were Communist troops, totaling more than 500, who launched attacks in four directions. One of the attacks was at the arson site, which is called Luyuan. Another was at Nanling. The other two were near the airfield. The Communist troops at each location retreated at dawn today. Also, during the engagement, Soviet troops deployed six tanks, patrolling the suburbs via Datong Street for a week as a warning. The Soviet City Defense Command also sent troops to patrol the city. The patrol troops mistakenly engaged the security forces responsible for guarding.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] Datun and Kaoshantun, located 19 kilometers south of Changchun, were just captured by the Communist Army yesterday morning. It was heard last night that several people attacked the suburbs. The situation in Changchun has suddenly become serious due to this. Also, there was fighting all night yesterday west of Changchun. The attackers carried many light machine guns. The first shot was fired at 1:45 AM (Chongqing time), followed by more gunfire, breaking the silence of the rainy night. According to official reports, an unidentified unit set fire to buildings along the Xingan Avenue West Station, from Xingan Bridge to the middle of the airfield. Two buildings formerly occupied by Soviet troops were burned. Sentries from the 13th Regiment of the 2nd Security Brigade went to stop them, and immediately clashed with the arsonists. Both sides deployed large forces, fighting all night until dawn, when the attackers were repelled. There were also gunshots in several locations in the city. The Mantan Building, where the headquarters and the military delegation are located, immediately deployed sentries to prepare for any eventuality. Hundreds of security guards entered the pre-arranged positions around the building, and some armed troops went upstairs to guard. Suddenly, the lights in part of the building went out, plunging half the city into darkness. Last night's battle caused panic among the city's residents. This morning, there were few pedestrians on the streets, and some shops only partially opened their doors.</p>
<h3>China and the UK to Allocate Funds for the Construction of Beiping</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 2nd] The Central Government is about to allocate funds for the construction of Beiping. Mayor Xiong, after returning to Beiping from Chongqing, reported on the construction of the city, such as renovating cultural relics, repairing roads, and continuing to build New Beiping, at the City Government Memorial Week yesterday. The Central Government will allocate funds to handle these matters.</p>
<h3>Unify Currency in Recovered Areas; Hope the Communist Party Stops Issuing Banknotes</h3>
<p>Five Negotiations Still Yield No Results</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 2nd] With the aim of unifying the currency system in the recovered areas, stabilizing finances, and alleviating people's suffering, the Ministry of Finance provided opinions to the government representatives of the Political Consultative Conference's Three-Person Committee. Zhang Qun and Zhang Zhizhong then negotiated with Zhou Enlai, the representative of the Communist Party, requesting that the Communist Party stop issuing banknotes in the Communist-occupied areas and lift the ban restricting the use of legal tender. It is heard that this negotiation has been held five times. Zhou Enlai expressed agreement in principle and has requested instructions from Yan'an. However, Yan'an has so far maintained a delaying attitude because the Communist Party is currently extending its influence in the Northeast, taking advantage of the opportunity to actively expand its military, and military expenditures are increasing to an uncontrollable extent. According to credible estimates, in the past eight years, the Communist Party has printed five kinds of banknotes, including anti-Japanese bonds and circulating notes, with a total issue amount that may have reached three trillion yuan.</p>
<h3>Senators Make a Painful Appeal: Do Not Sacrifice the People Again for Political Strife; Discussions on the Political Consultative Conference Report Cause Twists and Turns</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Chongqing, 2nd] At 4:15 PM today, the first plenary session of the Senate convened to discuss the review opinions on the report of the Political Consultative Conference, causing major twists and turns. The review document was drafted and passed by Special Review Group Three. However, when it was presented to the general assembly, the text had been greatly revised. Most senators believed that the secretariat had no authority to arbitrarily modify the review document of the small group. The Secretary-General of the Ministry denied acting on the orders of any presidium. Speakers in the meeting hall rose and fell, reaching a climax. As a result, after 5:40 PM, the original review was read and then amended and passed. In view of the fact that Communist troops continued to cause disturbances in various places after the Political Consultative Conference, a senator stood up during the discussion of the review document of the Political Consultative Conference and made a painful appeal, saying: "Politics must prioritize the interests of the country and the people, and the people must not be used as a tool for political strife, sacrificing the people to win [political points]." This won considerable applause from the entire audience.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Chongqing, 2nd] At 4:00 PM on the 2nd, the Senate passed the review opinions on the Executive Yuan's administrative report, which stated that colleagues in the assembly had doubts that the methods of increasing revenue and reducing expenditure proposed by Premier Song were sufficient to balance the budget.</p>
<h3>The Mystery of High Salaries for Employees of the China Textile Company</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] At the Second Plenary Session of the Central Committee last month, Committee Member Pan Gongzhan and Committee Member Wu Shaoshu asked about the monthly salaries of the general manager and employees at all levels of the China Textile Construction Company, saying that it was rumored that salaries in February were as high as one million yuan. The Ministry of Economic Affairs was responsible for providing a written response, with an attached comparison table of salary grades for the company, explaining: (A) Department heads, chief auditors, branch managers, and chief engineers receive salaries at levels 1 to 5, that is, 600 to 420 yuan; (B) Factory directors receive salaries at levels 1 to 8, that is, 600 yuan to 330 yuan; (C) Deputy department heads, deputy chief auditors, and deputy managers receive salaries at levels 2 to 6, that is, 550 yuan to 390 yuan; (D) Specialized committee members and engineers receive salaries at levels 4 to 11, that is, 450 yuan to 250 yuan; (E) Secretaries, auditors, section chiefs, master sergeants, specialists, and office directors receive salaries at levels 6 to 15, that is, 390 yuan to 170 yuan; (F) Office section chiefs receive salaries at levels 12 to 20; (G) Technicians and clerks receive salaries at levels 13 to 22; (H) Assistants receive salaries at levels 22 to 25. According to the table, the total salary and allowances for those with the highest base salary of 600 yuan is only 7,500 yuan, indicating that the salary grades of general employees are not very high. However, according to reporters' inquiries from reliable sources, the general manager, who receives a base salary of 800 yuan, and the deputy general manager, who receives a base salary of 700 yuan, are not specified in this table, which seems to be a near-evasive response. Furthermore, whether the salary grade table distributed at the plenary session is accurate and for what month are still questionable. This is because the company's salary grade table for February stipulates that (A) department heads who receive 600 yuan can receive a total of 282,286 yuan including salary and allowances, and even clerks who receive 100 yuan can receive 80,011 yuan. It can be seen that the Ministry of Economic Affairs' report to the plenary session that the highest salary paid was only 7,500,600 yuan is completely inaccurate. Furthermore, the company's February salary was calculated based on 899 times the total living cost index for staff and workers announced by the Shanghai Municipal Government in January, and then calculated accordingly. The calculation method for the index allowance is stipulated as follows: (1) Salaries of 80 yuan are issued according to the index (as a basic allowance). (2) Salaries below 80 yuan are given additional supplementary allowances: Salaries of 50, 60, and 70 yuan are given supplementary allowances of 30%, 20%, and 10%, respectively. (3) For salaries above 80 yuan, in addition to the 80 yuan basic allowance, the remaining salary amount is given a supplementary allowance of 45%. The above index allowance is based on 899 times the total living cost index for staff and workers announced by the Shanghai Municipal Government in January 1935. Then the formula for calculating the index allowance in February is (1) Basic allowance = 899 * base salary; (2) Salaries and allowances below 80 yuan = Basic allowance + (Basic allowance * supplementary allowance); (3) Salaries and allowances above 80 yuan = Basic allowance + (899 * 45% * the number of base salary exceeding 80 yuan), which is the total amount of salary and allowances issued for the index allowance in February. From this calculation, if the company's March salary is calculated according to 1464 times the total living cost index for staff and workers announced by the municipal government in February, then the general manager who receives a base salary of 800 yuan can often receive as much as 592,256 yuan, not including the bonuses (that is, the salary for several months added at the end of the year) issued from the company's profits. No wonder it is rumored that the salaries of senior employees of the China Textile Company are as high as one million yuan, and the truth is not difficult to discern. This not only makes other public educators envious, but even employees of general private enterprises can only sigh with admiration.</p>
<h3>The Current Senate Successfully Concludes; Resident Committee Members Elected; Jiang Yong Describes the Achievements of the Congress and Emphasizes National Reconstruction</h3>

<p>Telegram of Thanks to Marshal and the U.S. Military</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] The Senate today passed two telegrams: one to General Marshall and one to the U.S. military stationed in China. The original telegrams are as follows:</p>
<p>Telegram to General Marshall: To His Excellency General Marshall, for several months, Your Excellency has assisted our Supreme Commander with the deepest sympathy and greatest effort to overcome the various military difficulties after the war, not only contributing to the friendship between China and the United States, but also contributing to China's unification and solidarity.

After the end of the war, you assisted us in handling the disarmament of the enemy, sending prisoners of war and enemy expatriates back to their countries. All kinds of meritorious achievements are admired by the people of our country. Now, according to the resolution of the conference, we send this telegram to express our gratitude. National Senate of the Republic of China, April 2, 1946.</p>

<h3>Director Dai's Achievements in Leading the Military Statistics Bureau for 14 Years are Outstanding; Rumors Suggest Remains to be Buried at the Foot of Zijin Mountain in Nanjing</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 2nd] After the announcement of General Dai Li's death, Dai's family has officially held a mourning ceremony. Nanjing will schedule a public memorial service. Whether Dai's remains will be transported back to his hometown has not yet been determined, as there are rumors from Chongqing that he will be buried at the foot of Zijin Mountain. Kang Ze was once expected to succeed Dai, but Kang is currently abroad and is rumored to return to China within the month.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 2nd] The Military Statistics Bureau, under the leadership of the late Director Dai, has made great contributions to the anti-Japanese war over the past 14 years. Its achievements are recorded as follows: The work of the Military Statistics Bureau under Director Dai began on April 1, 1932, after the September 18th Incident. Its work was to fight for the Three People's Principles. During the eight years of the Anti-Japanese War, the information and action work arranged in the occupied areas, the investigation of the enemy and puppet military, political, economic, and general trends and conspiracies, the sabotage and assaults on the enemy, the sanctions against key enemy and puppet military and political personnel, the rescue of allied flight personnel, and the investigation of bombing targets behind enemy lines, all efforts have been made.</p>
<p>Collecting Intelligence to Strike at the Enemy</p>
<p>(1) Intelligence: Over the past 14 years, the bureau has collected intelligence to provide for the Supreme Commander and relevant military agencies for reference. Among them, there were many benefits to the national army and allied forces in fighting the enemy. For example, in March 1945, the bureau learned that the enemy would invade Nanyang, Laohekou and other places with 70,000 troops, and detailed the serial numbers, qualities, and deployment of the enemy troops assembled in southern Henan. The Supreme Headquarters made appropriate deployments in advance based on this intelligence, and finally gave the invading enemy a serious blow, which was commended by the Military Order Department. For another example, because the bureau was ordered to cooperate with the United States to exchange information, in December 1944, the bureau learned that the enemy's joint fleet, after being severely damaged in the sea battles of Taiwan and the Philippines, the enemy chief Yuta Fuzhi concentrated the remaining navy in the Ryukyu Islands to reorganize it. Kiyomizu Mitsumi was appointed as the commander of the first unit, with the Zhenhai Fortress Port of the Penghu Islands as the base point, and Matsumoto Masuyoshi was appointed as the commander of the second fleet, with the Ryukyu Islands as the base point. On January 7, 1945, the U.S. Navy attacked the Ryukyus and Taiwan based on this intelligence, sinking 83 enemy ships of all sizes and destroying 210 enemy aircraft. Afterwards, the U.S. side sent a letter of thanks. In addition, in the successive battles of northern Hunan and local battles, the bureau also obtained valuable intelligence for the Supreme Commander's reference.</p>
<p>Statistics on Actions during the Eight Years of the Anti-Japanese War</p>
<p>(2) Actions: During the eight years of the Anti-Japanese War, the bureau carried out 2,107 sabotages against the enemy, 585 assaults, and 515 sanctions against key enemy puppets. The number of enemy puppet personnel who died was 17,873, the number of wounded was 4,916, the number of captured was 566, the number of enemy military vehicles destroyed was 492, the number of cars 1,627, the number of automobiles 477, 23200 boxes of gasoline, 1797 electrical machines, 2675 meters of electrical wire, 15 machines, 442 ships, a total of 51 blockhouses, a total of 2318 guns, 33 artillery, and various ammunition 48310 boxes, 71 aircrafts, 1578 barracks, 81462 loads of military rations, 1316 electric poles, 5550 military uniforms and blankets, 5051 boxes of toxic gas raw materials, 250 bridges, 1658 meters of railway, 19924 lengths of barbed wire, 547 boxes of kerosene, 56451 bolts of silk cloth, 7670 bales of cotton, and many captured trophies. As for the effectiveness of the enemy work of the Commando Army of the Loyal National Salvation Army and the Sino-American Cooperative Organization commanded by the bureau, the US side has disclosed to the newspapers, so it will not be described in detail.</p>
<p>Ordered to Preside over the Arrest of Traitors</p>
<p>(3) Punishing Traitors: After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, Director Dai was ordered to preside over the arrest of traitors. Because he believed that if this matter was not handled well, it would not only fail to quell public anger, but also damage the discipline and integrity of the nation, he often personally went to important areas in the recovered areas to supervise his subordinates to handle it seriously. In summary, a total of 3,455 traitors have been arrested, and they are being transferred to local courts or military agencies for trial in accordance with the provisions of Article 5 of the Regulations on the Handling of Traitor Cases. As for the property of the traitors, it has also been sealed up and checked by the relevant agencies, and transferred to the local enemy puppet property handling bureaus for processing. Director Dai was on this trip north to handle the traitor cases when he encountered a plane crash on the way from Qingdao to Nanjing. The above is a summary of the situation. The late Director Dai and the staff under his leadership sacrificed more than 4,000 people in the anti-Japanese war, but they also achieved the above results, which also had a price.</p>
<h3>Central Party Headquarters Preparing to Return to the Capital</h3>
<p>Wu Tiecheng Plans to Fly to Nanjing in the Middle of the Month</p>

<h3>Conflict of Opinions Between the Communist Party and the Youth Party; Political Consultative Conference Small Group Discusses Constitutional Amendments; Fierce Debate Between the Two Sides on the Provincial Autonomy Law</h3>
<p>[This newspaper's Chongqing, 2nd] The Political Consultative Conference Comprehensive Group and the Constitutional Draft Review Committee held a joint meeting yesterday. After two and a half hours of discussion, a major agreement was reached on the principles of constitutional amendment: (1) Regarding the National Assembly's organization, representatives from all sides agreed to form a National Assembly composed of representatives from the Legislative Yuan, the Control Yuan, county representatives, overseas Chinese representatives, and representatives from ethnic minorities in border regions. At that time, the Youth Party representative proposed adding occupational representatives, but this was not adopted by all parties due to concerns about double elections. (2) Regarding the relationship between the Legislative Yuan and the Executive Yuan, representatives from all sides agreed that the latter should be responsible to the former. If the President believes that there are difficulties in implementing a resolution passed by the Legislative Yuan, he may submit it for reconsideration. If two-thirds of the Legislative Yuan agree to uphold the original resolution, the Executive Yuan must still implement it. Representatives from the government and the Communist Party must seek instructions from their respective central authorities before a final decision can be made on this agreement. (3) The drafting of a provincial autonomy law was not agreed upon by all parties. At that time, the Youth Party representative argued that the provincial autonomy law must be passed by the Legislative Yuan to take effect, which was fiercely opposed by the Communist Party representative. The Youth Party representative angrily withdrew from the meeting. By then, it was late in the evening, and all issues remained unresolved. Discussions will continue on the 3rd.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 2nd] The Political Consultative Conference Comprehensive Group continued its meeting on the morning of the 3rd. It is reported that the Youth Party representative sent a letter to convener Sun Ke today, stating that they will not attend the meeting. It is understood that this is because, during the afternoon meeting on the 1st to discuss the constitutional draft, the Communist Party put forward the following opinion on the "Provincial Autonomy Law" issue: "Provinces may formulate fundamental autonomy laws, which the central government may not alter." After an exchange of views, Youth Party representative Chen Qitian explained that "the provincial autonomy law must be passed by the Legislative Yuan to avoid conflicts with the national constitution. Once the provincial autonomy law has been passed by the Legislative Yuan, the central government may not alter it by order." Communist Party representative Qin Bangxian immediately stood up to oppose Chen's proposal, calling it "ignorant" and "muddled." Chen then rose to respond, saying, "Local autonomy bills must be passed by parliament, as is the precedent in Britain. It cannot be called 'ignorant,' let alone 'muddled.' Cursing people casually is not in line with a spirit of consultation or a democratic demeanor. I request that the chairman correct this." Chairman Sun Ke immediately rose to explain that Chen's proposal has a precedent to rely on. We can prove this by examining the British local autonomy bill, which was first passed by Parliament. As for the Communist Party's proposal, there is no precedent in history. We should study the history of autonomy in various countries more. Qin still did not admit his mistake. Finally, Youth Party representative Zeng Qi spoke, saying, "We are here to consult, we should reason, not hurl abuse. Under this unreasonable attitude, we cannot continue the discussion and have no choice but to withdraw." After Zeng finished speaking, he and Chen withdrew at the same time.</p>

<h3>Pacific Earthquake and Tsunami Cause Unprecedented Disaster; Epicenter in the Seabed of the Aleutian Islands; City of Hilo, Hawaii, Almost Completely Destroyed</h3>
<p>[This newspaper's report] San Francisco, broadcast on the 2nd: A violent earthquake occurred on the seabed of the Pacific Ocean, with surging tides and white waves reaching the sky. Along the coasts of the Aleutian Islands, California, and other places, waves crashed ashore, sweeping residents into the towering waves. The waves have now subsided, and eighty-six bodies have been found, but the actual number of casualties is certainly more than this. The epicenter of the earthquake was near Alaska. Geologists say that the force of the earthquake traveled through the water at a speed of 400 to 500 miles per hour, and the height of the waves ranged from ten to one hundred feet. The city of Hilo, with a population of 25,000, has been almost completely destroyed.</p>
<p>Also, according to news from Pearl Harbor: At least 300 people in Hilo have died or are missing, and 10,000 people are homeless. The city's food supply is only enough for two days.</p>
<p>[This newspaper's report] San Francisco, broadcast on the 2nd: At 1:30 AM this morning, a violent earthquake occurred from the Aleutian Islands and Alaska in the north to Honolulu in the west and the west coast of the United States in the east. At the same time, gales and heavy rain swept the ocean, and tsunamis caused disasters along the coast. The number of casualties and material losses cannot yet be investigated because the earthquake and storm are still in progress.</p>
<p>The states most severely affected on the west coast of the United States are Washington, Oregon, and California. The lighthouse outside Seattle was completely destroyed, and the personnel on the lighthouse were swept into the sea. Waves were 10 to 20 feet high, and the beaches along the coast were full of broken debris swept in by the waves. All radio stations issued emergency signals, warning ships at sea. The most intense part of the earthquake was on the seabed of the Aleutian Islands, which is 15,000 feet under the sea. The waves on the sea surface were 90 feet high. Naval and air force planes were dispatched to search for ships in distress.</p>
<h3>Byrnes Meets with Truman to Discuss the Situation in the United Nations; The Contents of the Hour-and-a-Half Meeting are Closely Guarded</h3>
<p>[US News Agency, Washington, 1st] Secretary of State Byrnes today discussed the United Nations Security Council meeting and diplomatic issues with President Truman for an hour and a half.</p>
<p>[French News Agency, Washington, 1st] Secretary of State Byrnes declared at a press conference that the Security Council had previously requested the governments of the Soviet Union and Iran to report on the progress of negotiations between the two countries. However, he was unaware of the widespread rumor that the Secretary-General of the General Assembly had already received replies from the two countries. As for his 90-minute meeting with the President today, the contents were inconvenient to announce, but the main topic of discussion was the situation in the United Nations. At this point, a reporter asked if he hoped to meet with Soviet representative Gromyko at the Security Council meeting on April 3rd. Mr. Byrnes replied, "Goodbye, everyone," and then left the room.</p>
<p>[French News Agency, London, 1st] The Evening Standard recently published a dispatch from a correspondent in Washington stating that US Ambassador to the Soviet Union Smith had assured Stalin and Foreign Minister Molotov that the US did not oppose the Soviet Union obtaining Iranian oil fields by legal means and expressed that the US supports international control of Iranian oil fields.</p>

<h3>Soviet Troops Show No Signs of Withdrawal from Iranian Tabriz; British and American Embassies in Iran Have Made Extensive Reports</h3>
<p>[This newspaper's report] London, broadcast on the 2nd: Two British observers flew over northern Iran today. Flying over the cities of Qazvin, Tabriz, and Rasht, they confirmed that Soviet troops had indeed withdrawn from Qazvin. There was frequent movement around Tabriz, but no signs of withdrawal. The aviation visibility today was poor, but Russian military stations in the direction of Qazvin and Tangistan have been evacuated. A week ago, there were 22 tanks and fighters stationed in that area, but they are no longer there.</p>
<p>[This newspaper's report] London, broadcast on the 2nd: The British and American embassies in Iran have sent extensive reports to London and Washington on the movements of Soviet troops, including the experience of US Deputy Military Attaché Captain Gatchalian, who personally inspected Tabriz. At the same time, the Iranian Cabinet has begun working in extreme secrecy to respond to the United Nations Security Council's request for information. In addition, personnel from the Soviet, British, and American embassies are also in constant contact with Iranian government officials, working intensely.</p>
<p>[French News Agency, Tehran, 2nd] The Secretary of the Prime Minister's Office, Firooz, told reporters today that the Iranian government has received the Security Council's note requesting information on Iranian-Soviet negotiations. When asked whether Iranian Prime Minister Sadar al-Din and Soviet Ambassador Sazhikov are still in negotiations, and whether these negotiations are related to the issue of Soviet troop withdrawal, Firooz replied: The Prime Minister and the Soviet Ambassador are currently in contact, but the content of the negotiations only involves general issues related to both parties. The issue of future relations between Iran and the Soviet Union will not be discussed until after the fifth or sixth period, that is, when Soviet troops have completely withdrawn. When asked whether the Soviet troop withdrawal has been accelerated, and whether there are any signs of Soviet troops withdrawing from Iran to the Soviet Union, Firooz replied: Soviet troops in Mazandaran Province have almost completely withdrawn. Currently, six Soviet ships are docked at the port of Bandar Anzali on the Caspian Sea, loading Soviet soldiers. As for the government's recent appointment of Mr. Sai as Minister Plenipotentiary to the Soviet Union, it is because the Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Mr. Amran, is currently ill, so Mr. Sai was sent to assist him. Sai is a staunch pro-Soviet figure and a member of Prime Minister Sadar al-Din's delegation to the Soviet Union.</p>
<h3>Conference of Five Foreign Ministers May Be Convened This Month; However, Both the United States and France Deny This</h3>
<p>[This newspaper's report] London, broadcast on the 2nd: The reason why the Five Foreign Ministers Conference in London last autumn failed was that the Soviet Union was unwilling to give the five powers equal say in drafting peace treaties with the former Balkan enemy states and Italy. As of now, there is no sign that the Soviet Union is willing to give the 21 countries participating in the Paris Peace Conference more rights than passing the final draft. A conference of the five or three foreign ministers may break the deadlock this month. Observers believe that this conference is very likely.</p>
<p>[US News Agency, Washington, 1st] Although Secretary of State Byrnes is here, Acting Secretary of State Acheson continues to perform his duties. State Department Press Secretary McDermott said at a press conference today that Acheson's continued acting as Secretary of State is to allow Byrnes, who is attending the United Nations Security Council meeting in New York, to freely handle all matters other than the routine business of the State Department. When asked about reports that French Ambassador Bonnet suggested that the foreign ministers of the four major powers hold a meeting in Paris on April 14th, McDermott said that he had not heard of such a suggestion. He pointed out that the Paris Peace Conference is scheduled to begin on May 1st, but there is no agreement on a foreign ministers conference before then.</p>
<p>[French News Agency, New York, 1st] Reports that French Ambassador to the United States Bonnet met with US Secretary of State Byrnes and proposed holding a foreign ministers conference in Paris on April 1st to discuss the Spanish issue and the German control issue have been denied by the French Embassy in the United States.</p>

<h3>American Rocket Weapons; "Little Jane" and "Holy Moses" Have the Greatest Power</h3>
<p>[US News Agency, Washington, 1st] The US Army and Navy Department's Scientific Research and Invention Group released its first report on the invention and use of new rocket weapons during World War II. The report revealed that the US Army and Navy did not have a rocket launcher on the day the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor. One of the best-performing new rockets is the newest and largest, nicknamed "Little Jane," an air-to-ground rocket launcher. Each pair of these rocket launchers is placed in the bomb bay of the aircraft. The projectile is 10 feet 3 inches long, 1 foot in diameter, and weighs 1,284 pounds. American fighter planes equipped with this type of rocket launcher have a power comparable to a single salvo from a light cruiser. During the Battle of Okinawa, the US military used "Little Jane" to strike the Japanese. Another powerful and widely used air-to-ground rocket launcher is called "Holy Moses." This rocket launcher is 6 feet long, weighs 140 pounds, and can reach a speed of 1,375 feet per second. In July 1944, the US military began using "Holy Moses" in combat. Each P-47 fighter carried eight of these rockets. They assisted in breaking through the Saint-Lô defenses during the Normandy landings and made great contributions. By the end of the war, the Navy had manufactured super rocket ships, each of which could launch 300 to 500 rockets per minute. A new type of bazooka was also invented at the end of the war. The effective range of the well-known anti-tank bazooka was 200 to 300 yards. The effective range of the new bazooka can reach 700 yards, and the projectile speed and explosive power are doubled compared to the standard bazooka projectile.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Obstacles to Japan's Democratization</h3>
<p>The Allied Council for Japan is scheduled to hold its inaugural meeting in Tokyo on the 5th of this month. The Chinese Chief Representative, Lieutenant General Zhu Shimin and his party, arrived in Tokyo on the 31st of last month. On the eve of his departure for his post, Zhu made a statement to Shanghai reporters, praising General MacArthur's policy of governing Japan. Since Japan's surrender, MacArthur, in his capacity as Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces, has been stationed in Japan to implement governance. He represents not only the United States but also other allied nations that fought against Japan. The establishment of the Allied Council for Japan is not an organization to supervise MacArthur, but a machine to assist MacArthur in governing. Gathering representatives of the allied nations in one place is intended to pool wisdom and broaden ideas. Its purpose is to assist, not to supervise. In the past, the major allied nations, especially the Soviet Union, often held considerably different views on governing Japan. Now, with the establishment of the Allied Council for Japan, representatives from various countries can have the opportunity to exchange opinions, which may reduce some of the past differences. MacArthur's hard work and dedication over the past seven months in governing Japan should be universally praised by the world. The clearing of the remnants of feudal forces, the dissolution of the zaibatsu, and assisting Japan in its progress toward democratization are all aimed at fostering a democratic rebirth for defeated Japan. As the Allied Council for Japan is about to hold its first meeting, I would like to express my views on this issue.</p>
<p>Japan was the main culprit of this war, and now, as a defeated nation under control, it has lost its eligibility to participate in international activities. This is the punishment that the main instigator of aggression deserves, but from a longer-term perspective, this is only a temporary transition. Even if the allied nations need to control Japan for thirty, fifty, or even one hundred years, there will eventually come a time when this control must be lifted. Therefore, the success of the allied nations' control over Japan lies not in the length of the control period, but in its effectiveness. The meaning of control is more like carrying out education than executing a judicial judgment. It is essential to make the Japanese people thoroughly repent for the mistakes of their past actions, understand why their actions were wrong, and how to avoid making the same mistakes again. Only with this thorough self-awareness can Japan have a new birth. MacArthur's governance of Japan has focused on removing the various objective obstacles to Japan's self-awareness, such as the dissolution of the zaibatsu and the eradication of the remnants of feudal forces, which is a necessary foundation for Japan's self-awareness.</p>
<p>According to news reports, the Japanese people in Hokkaido have recently begun to stir and express resistance to the Allied occupation. Even if the number of such mutineers is not too large, or only a very small part of the Japanese people, the existence of such signs should be taken seriously. Coincidentally, when the news of the Japanese people in Hokkaido plotting rebellion came, the remaining Nazis in Germany were also starting to stir. According to a Reuters report from Berlin on March 31, British and American military intelligence personnel have discovered Nazi groups plotting rebellion. According to another telegram from Frankfurt, British troops have destroyed Nazi secret groups in their occupation zone with several thousand Allied forces, and there were many firefights, as if in combat. According to General Shepp, chief of US military intelligence, the purpose of this Nazi secret group is to implement the second stage of Nazi political strategy, hoping to seize power in the future by clever means. It is inevitable that groups of the same nature exist in Japan. Preventing the revival of Japanese aggressive imperial ideology is not simply about eradicating such secret groups. If such groups exist in Japan, we can be confident that the Allied authorities will take effective measures. But the real problem lies on the other side.</p>
<p>That is, we must remove the two main obstacles that will prevent Japan from democratizing: the Emperor system and State Shintoism. If the Emperor system and State Shintoism are not eradicated, then the Japanese militarists' dream of "Hakko Ichiu" will continue, just as the Nazi remnants are rekindling their hopes and want to implement the second stage of the Nazi political strategy. Although the Atlantic Charter proposed religious freedom, Japan's State Shintoism was created by the ruling militarists to implement their rule. Since this religion is a political tool of the Japanese rulers, the principle of religious freedom cannot be applied to Japan's State Shintoism, and it should be eradicated by external forces. The Japanese imperial system must also be eradicated by external forces. The Japanese people have been deeply poisoned by the imperial system and State Shintoism, and they themselves seem to have no power to clear this poison. Therefore, regarding the imperial system and State Shintoism, we cannot allow the Japanese people to act on their own. Japan's constitution is being revised. If these two poisons, which are actually two-in-one, cannot be eradicated, then the revision of the constitution will be equivalent to empty words.</p>
<p>Although our government has not explicitly expressed its position on abolishing the Japanese imperial family, the entire nation has a consensus. The Chinese representative to the Allied Council for Japan has taken office, and we are confident that he will express the wishes of the Chinese people. For the sake of peace and happiness in China and the world, we cannot allow the revival of Japanese aggression. Preventing the revival of Japanese aggression requires the eradication of the Emperor system and State Shintoism as a prerequisite. Japan must truly embark on the path of democratization only after these two poisons are eradicated.</p>
<h3>US Coal Miners Begin General Strike</h3>
<p>Steel Production to Be Affected</p>
<p>[TASS New One Day Telegram] According to a New York radio broadcast, 400,000 US coal miners began a strike late yesterday.

<h3>MacArthur Deeply Distressed by the Conduct of US Troops in Japan</h3>
<p>Special Letter to Soldiers</p>
<p>[Our newspaper] Tokyo, 2nd Broadcast: General MacArthur, Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces, wrote a letter today to all US Army soldiers stationed in Japan, stating that he has recently received letters from American families expressing deep distress over the chaotic relationships between occupying forces and unfaithful Japanese women. Unfortunately, some people have misinterpreted the true meaning of "fraternization" and have engaged in various immoral behaviors. Now, Japanese brothels and all disreputable places have been prohibited to the soldiers. This is a matter of self-control, and no order prohibiting soldiers from cutting off social relations with the Japanese people can be effective. This matter is both inconvenient to implement and cannot solve the problem, but will only undermine the self-esteem and human rights of American soldiers.</p>

<h3>British Delegation Aims to Help India Formulate a New Constitution, Cripps Delivers a Speech, Negotiations in New Delhi Underway</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper] London, 2nd Broadcast: The British Cabinet delegation continued negotiations with Indian opposition leaders in New Delhi today.</p>
<p>[French News Agency New Delhi, 1st Telegram] British Trade Minister Cripps recently told reporters: The British delegation's visit to India is not to represent Britain in negotiations with India, but only to help India reach a consensus internally. Therefore, the main purpose of this visit is to assist India in formulating a new constitution to achieve independence. As for the future of India, it is entirely in the hands of the Indian people. The British government believes that its mission will be completed as soon as the new constitution is established, and it does not want to bear any responsibility for future developments. Therefore, when we leave India and return home, we will allow India to be independent.</p>

<p>Hope for Relief for Refugees in Jiangsu Province</p>
<p>The disaster area in Jiangsu Province is vast, and refugees are everywhere, urgently in need of relief. The provincial government has previously contacted the Jiangsu-Nanjing Branch to launch winter relief work in the provincial capital, and has organized charitable relief associations in various counties and cities to actively handle relief matters. However, relief supplies are insufficient for distribution, causing disaster victims to be unable to benefit fully. For this reason, Chairman Wang specially sent an earnest telegram to the headquarters of the General Relief Association, requesting the rapid allocation of a large number of supplies to expand relief. The association has now telegraphed the provincial government, stating that it has ordered the Jiangsu-Nanjing Branch to earnestly handle relief and set a deadline for reporting. If the Jiangsu-Nanjing Branch can reform its past habits of procrastination and shirking responsibility, the refugees in Jiangsu Province will benefit greatly.</p>

<p>Severe Food Shortage Leads to Starvation Suicides</p>
<p>Since the price of coarse rice was set at 25,000 yuan per stone on the 19th of last month, rice and grain have disappeared from the countryside and are not available on the market. General speculators have taken the opportunity to raise prices, and the black market has risen to about 40,000 yuan. In the urban area in particular, not a grain of rice is sold. People have no rice to cook and generally eat flat grass bran cakes for a living. It is reported that cases of starvation and suicide are often heard of in various townships.</p>
<p>Difficult to Make a Living, Slaughter Cattle for Food: Farmers in the four rural areas of this county are selling off their livestock due to the severe food shortage. Some are slaughtering them for food, resulting in a severe shortage of cattle. Last month, cattle prices had already soared to 200,000 to 300,000 yuan per head. Pig prices have also risen to 80,000 to 90,000 yuan. Spring plowing is approaching, and there is great anxiety due to the lack of cattle for plowing.</p>

<h3>The Future of People's Food is Extremely Optimistic, Minister Xu Indicates, Subsidized Flour Sales to Resume Within Days</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper] This reporter recently visited Food Minister Xu Kan, who was holding a meeting with grain merchant representatives and others and could not spare the time, so he appointed an important official of the ministry to meet on his behalf. He spoke with certainty, expressing extreme optimism about the future of food administration in China and Shanghai. He said: The minister's task here is, firstly, to review the supply situation of military and civilian food, inspect the ministry's business, present it to President Song, and convene relevant personnel to jointly study the food problem. Secondly, to strive to smooth the flow of rice and grain sources, it is expected that after the weather clears, grain prices will inevitably fall. The rice and grain reserves in this city are still abundant, and the sources are smooth. In the future, we will continue to make efforts to increase the reserves and smooth the sources. Therefore, the future of rice and grain in this city will fall, not rise. It is reported that President Song attaches special importance to the food problem during this visit to Shanghai. In addition to ordering the thickening of reserves and smoothing of sources, he also hopes that the provinces can reasonably hand over grain reserves that exceed normal consumption. For military grain in various provinces that have been paid for several months ago, he has ordered that the full amount be urged. It is reported that although the disaster situation in Hunan is severe, it is not as severe as reported by various parties. Now, in addition to the military grain in the province, which should be collected on its own, the ministry has made overall arrangements for the military grain in other major military regions. Regarding the "United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration" (UNRRA) plan for the allocation of food to China, Minister Xu recently sent a special telegram to Jiang Tingfu, the director of the Chinese "Executive Headquarters" in the United States, focusing on two points: (1) Notifying the disaster situation in China, and (2) Having a minimum required number for the food allocation to China from the "UNRRA." Finally, it is reported that the "UNRRA" flour had previously stopped selling, but it has now been decided to resume selling it within one or two days. The selling price this time will be slightly lower than the market price, in order to curb the rampant black market and gradually reduce the flour price to a reasonable level. The Ministry of Food has also ordered a large quantity of rice and flour from abroad. It is said that the first batch of flour will have 180,000 bags, and the exact amount of rice is unknown. The purchase contract has now been signed and foreign exchange will be settled soon. It is said that since arriving in Shanghai, Minister Xu has repeatedly convened meetings with existing and past grain merchants and local people concerned in this city. He has discussed many issues related to smoothing the sources.</p>
<h3>Registered Opium Addicts Not Allowed to Change Residence, Deadline for Household Heads to Report Addicts is the 15th of This Month, Hospitals Pose a Problem During Compulsory Rehabilitation</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper] According to news from the General Bureau, the registration of opium addicts for self-renewal, which was handled by the bureau, ended at the end of March. As of yesterday, the bureau had a total of 4,565 registered people reported by 17 branch bureaus. Among them, the Taishan Branch Bureau registered the largest number of people, with 555 people. The number of registered people from several other branch bureaus has not yet been reported to the General Bureau.</p>
<p>It is learned that there has never been statistics on the exact number of opium addicts in this city. During the enemy-puppet occupation period, the puppet opium prohibition bureau registered approximately 13,000 opium addicts. However, many of them registered in order to purchase allocated opium, and some have moved or died, so this number cannot be accurate. It is heard that the police bureau will order registered opium addicts not to change their residence. The investigators sent by the bureau will have formal official documents from the police bureau as proof. If there are unscrupulous elements impersonating and extorting money, they can be handed over to the police bureau for strict handling. The bureau is currently requesting the city government to allocate more than 17 million yuan in inspection funds to inspect opium addicts' opium addiction. Also, the police bureau has designated a period of two weeks, from April 1st to the 15th, as the period for household heads to report opium addicts in their households. If unregistered opium addicts are discovered after the deadline, the household head will also be subject to joint and several punishment.</p>
<p>It is also learned that the police bureau originally intended to use more than 100 boxes of opium seized from the puppet opium prohibition bureau as raw materials for opium cessation. However, after the opium was jointly received by the Jing'an Temple Branch of the police bureau, the garrison headquarters, the gendarmerie regiment, and the local baojia chiefs, the original site of the puppet opium prohibition bureau was used for other purposes, and the opium was moved to the garrison headquarters for temporary storage. During the relocation, more than a dozen small packages of fake opium were found. Therefore, the police bureau will consider using it after this matter is resolved.</p>
<p>This reporter then went to the health bureau to visit the authorities in charge of opium cessation medical affairs. They said that in addition to ordering the municipal hospitals under their jurisdiction to pay attention to promoting opium cessation, they have also notified all public and private hospitals and physicians who have obtained business licenses in this city to assist in handling the matter. The municipal hospitals under the bureau have a total of ten units, including a municipal opium cessation hospital that specializes in opium cessation, located at No. 907, Yokohama Road. It is said that the bureau is currently facing two difficulties in opium cessation work: one is the lack of anesthetics. The bureau initially planned to self-produce anesthetic opium cessation drugs, but the Ministry of Health ordered that opium cessation drugs in Beijing and Shanghai should be manufactured by the Ministry of Health and then allocated in a unified manner, so it gave up. The second is that hospitals are quite lacking when implementing compulsory rehabilitation. It is reported that there must be many opium addicts who voluntarily quit, but there are also extremely poor opium addicts who must be provided with free opium cessation. The bureau is now actively planning to build more opium cessation hospitals and add beds in order to ensure the smooth implementation of opium cessation matters.</p>
<h3>Employees of Two Foreign News Agencies Go on Strike Yesterday</h3>

<p>Director Wu of the Central Printing Bureau Talks</p>
<p>The labor unrest at the Central Printing Bureau has lasted for many days. According to Director Wu of the Social Affairs Bureau yesterday, factories No. 1, 3, and 4 of the bureau have resumed work, but the wage issue has yet to be resolved. The workers' proposal to use the cost of living index as the standard for raises and decreases should be protected. He has ordered the factory to prepare a plan in accordance with this principle so that it can be submitted to the Wage Review Committee for rapid approval. In short, all reasonable demands will be accommodated as much as possible, but excessive demands are truly beyond our ability to help. We sincerely hope that all workers understand that state-owned enterprises are of great importance. Those who have not resumed work should resume work quickly. For those who have not been resolved, we will handle them impartially.</p>

<p>Ding Fengying, a Yangzhou prostitute, 19 years old, was sold last winter by her father to Shao Xu, an old madam of a brothel located at No. 7, A, Pingle Lane, Xizang Road, Jiujiang Road, due to poverty. Yu Rucai, a patron from Shandong (seen), who is in his forties, worked as a partner in the China Bird Shop at No. 18, Guangdong Road, and was a sailor on the Japanese ship, the Haruko-maru last year.

At about 6:10 the next morning, he took advantage of Feng's deep sleep and stabbed her in the chest with a sharp blade, causing her intestines to flow out. Ding cried out for help in great pain. Yu, fearing punishment for his crime, stabbed himself in the chest, about three inches deep. Blood splattered all over the bed. Shao Xu, the madam downstairs, heard the alarm and rushed to the third-floor attic to investigate. She was shocked by the sight and immediately ran to report to the Lao Zha Branch.

<h3>This City's Provisional Council Held Its 45th Meeting Yesterday, Councilors Raised Many Questions Regarding Improving Sanitation and Eliminating Illiteracy</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The Shanghai Provisional Council held its fourth general assembly at 9:15 AM yesterday morning. Chairman Xu Jilun was absent, and Vice Chairman Xi Yushu presided in his place. A total of forty councilors were present. Councilors Feng Youzhen and Shen Chunhui represented the council yesterday morning in attending the memorial mass for the late Councilor Zhao Zhiyou at the Catholic Church on Luban Road and the funeral at the Lujiawan Cemetery. After a report by Yu Songyun, Director of the Health Bureau, councilors raised questions:</p>
<p>What Remedial Measures are There for Expanding Free Hospital Beds?</p>
<p>Councilor Xu Shihao stood up and said: (1) There is a lack of hospital beds. If adding beds requires payment, it will still not benefit the common people. What remedial measures does the Health Bureau have to expand free hospital beds? (2) It has been nearly seven months since the takeover. Has the work been completed? Why has the First Municipal Hospital not yet been taken over? Can the takeover of other hospitals be expedited? (3) Cholera is about to become epidemic. Is there any preparation for epidemic prevention? It is hoped that the tragedy seen in Chongqing will not be staged in Shanghai. (4) Fake medicines are rampant in the market, harming people greatly, and should be strictly banned. Zhou Xuehu said: Venereal diseases are prevalent in this city and universal free examination should be carried out quickly. The majority of women still give birth using old methods and rational methods must be promoted. More than half of children die from smallpox, so special attention should be paid. Zhao Banfu painfully stated that the equipment for the winter shelter on Jessfield Road does not meet hygiene standards. Workers who returned from Chongqing were sent to the shelter. How can they survive! The Labor Hospital will be built in three years, which is too long. Can efforts be doubled and completed within a year and a half? Doctors are terrible and scary when they see patients. How can patients dare to approach them? Can this be improved? Shui Xiangyun said: There is several times more garbage in the streets now than during the leased territories. There are only five ordinary hospitals, and even fewer civilian hospitals. Please pay attention. The treatment of cleaning workers should also be reasonable. Shen Feng suggested that the time for clearing garbage and manure should be advanced and there are too many prostitutes, who should be forced to receive treatment and clinics should be rectified.</p>
<p>DDT Insecticide Should Not Be Stored in Warehouses</p>
<p>Zhan Wenhau asked that DDT not be stored in warehouses and that it should be used universally. The results of inspecting fake medicines and fake wines should be announced at any time. Why has the First Municipal Hospital not been taken over? Ye Fenghu agreed that DDT should be sprayed on a large scale by airplanes. Flush toilets are not hygienic when they are available but not working. Can the work of clearing ditches be resolved quickly? Garbage cans should be matched with users to ensure convenience. Hou Junren asked why the Health Bureau did not go when schools in the suburbs requested vaccination? Health stations should be set up universally. Fan Caiji asked: The Labor Hospital on Xiaoshadu Road does not serve all laborers, and the fees are high. Can this be improved? Are there plans to set up a labor hospital in the Pudong factory area? Xu Yongzuo asked the director to report in detail on the hospitals that have been taken over and those that have not, and how many there are? Can we ask the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration to allocate beds? It is reported that the system of public prostitution should be implemented. Should this system be established? Lu Enlan requested that publicity on maternal and child health and venereal diseases be expanded. Lü Entan proposed that unqualified doctors and hospitals with unqualified equipment be quickly banned. Cao Jun said that garbage in the suburbs should be thoroughly disposed of. Bars and restaurants should not arbitrarily post the words "In Bounds" of the US military-designated cafeteria. Zhou Feicheng said that school health is limited to 14 schools, which is too few, and should be carried out universally. Li Hao advocated that medicines should be inspected before being supplied for use. Attention should be paid to the attitude of doctors, nurses and staff. What effective methods are there for treating sexually transmitted diseases?</p>
<p>Director Yu's Reply</p>
<p>Director Yu Gao then gave a brief reply: There are not enough beds due to (1) a lack of houses. The Enemy Property Administration Bureau has been requested, but there have been no results. (2) There is a lack of funding. Plans have been drafted for the construction of a labor hospital, but there are insufficient funds, and the government has been asked to allocate funds. The First Municipal Hospital is located in the city center. After the former Japanese army occupied it, it was converted into an army hospital. The Military Command Department has taken over, and negotiations have failed several times. Cholera vaccine can be supplied for one million people. Various vaccines used in other places are manufactured and supplied by this bureau. When epidemics are prevalent, it is planned to merge all municipal hospitals into an epidemic prevention hospital. Although the greatest efforts have been made to clear streets and lanes, financial resources and materials are lacking, resulting in imperfections. We are determined to continue to handle it in order to achieve the pre-war state. If workers arbitrarily dump manure into ditches, please report it to this bureau, and they will be dismissed. You can send a letter to the bureau to clear the ditches, and people will be sent to clear them. In the future, the clearing work must be completed before 6:00 AM. The treatment of workers follows the central government's regulations, and each person can now get 41,000 yuan per month. In the Pudong area, there is now the Sacred Heart Hospital for the diagnosis and treatment of workers. In the future, a labor hospital will be built again. Four worker health clinics have been set up. The Labor Hospital on Xiaoshadu Road is not run by the city and can be investigated. The winter shelter is not run by this bureau, but personnel have been dispatched to diagnose and treat smallpox and other diseases since yesterday. The kindness of doctors, nurses, etc. will be urged to be corrected at any time. School health is also planned to be expanded. If a letter is received, we will definitely go to serve. Not much DDT has been received and it has not been stored in the warehouse. Shanghai was sprayed by airplanes in the very beginning of the recovery. If you want to hold it again, you must consult with the US military authorities. The United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration plans to allocate more than 1,000 beds, but it has not yet been received. There is a portion of penicillin and DDT among the drugs received and it is a small amount. Other items include milk powder and typhus drugs. I strongly agree with the compulsory treatment of prostitutes. After a large number of drugs are shipped, it can be implemented. The "In Bounds" sign at the bar has been investigated jointly with the US military medical officer several times. The meeting was adjourned at 12:01, and other inquiries will be answered in writing.</p>
<p>Should Foreign-Run Schools Be Subjected to Additional Supervision?</p>
<p>The fifth congress was in the afternoon, and Mayor Qian, Deputy Mayor He, Secretary General Shen, and Chairman Xu Jiyi all attended. Secretary General Xiang Quan reported that a total of 31 proposals, 9 letters of opinion from citizens, and 2 petitions were received. After the report by Deputy Director Li Ximou of the Education Bureau was completed, the councilors raised questions in succession: Councilor Zhan Wenhua asked: In the report, there is a Shanghai Japanese Middle School at Matsui Road in the city center. Why has it not been corrected until now? The demeanor of a great nation cannot be so generous. The enslaved education that primary and secondary school students received during the enemy-puppet period should be corrected quickly. Zhou Feicheng proposed: (1) Vocational education should be increased and the ratio should be specified with secondary education. (2) School equipment is too incomplete and efforts should be made to add it. (3) After the Western Children's School is taken over, should the expenses of Chinese people be used to train the children of foreigners? Is it planned to suspend it next semester? The Sino-French School on Ningxia Road has not been taken over, please investigate. It is traditionally believed that the Education Bureau is working hard in personnel selection and are admired. But it is proposed: (1) The treatment of teachers and staff should be adjusted. Teacher strikes are an implication that students do not obey discipline and affect their personality. Should the Education Bureau be responsible? Is it appropriate to raise money to support teachers in the movement to respect teachers and it should be considered. (2) What are the plans to subsidize excellent private schools and ban unqualified private schools? (3) Schools in Zhabei should be investigated and increased. Shen Chunhui proposed to quickly eliminate illiteracy and set up schools universally. Zhan Wenhua asked again: (1) The venue of this council is a French school, has it been taken over? If not, why? (2) The Education Bureau plans to establish large-scale museums, libraries, art galleries, etc. If there are such materials, it is of course good, but can we postpone it temporarily and use the material resources, financial resources, and manpower to eliminate the work of Yuyu first. (3) The Qing situation in the blind sector is sympathized by everyone. On the one hand, it is hoped to improve treatment, and on the other hand, it is proposed that the general assembly pass a motion to pay tribute to the teachers at all levels in this city. Wang Bing stood up to express his agreement. Pan Xulun asked to pay attention to running remedial schools. Ji Hao asked the Bureau to subsidize the expenses of private schools, otherwise, please consider slightly increasing tuition fees to maintain the lives of teachers and staff. He Bingsong asked what plans were there for the establishment of the Roosevelt Library in the city, which he had heard about before?</p>
<p>Deputy Director Li's Reply</p>
<p>Deputy Director Li then replied to everyone: The name Matsui Road was not changed in the report, which was indeed a mistake. The schools that were taken over after the false government school and the students were screened, examined, and subjected to ideological training. There are early plans to expand vocational education, but the development of secondary schools must be taken into account. There are 2,000 boxes of instruments at the Central Research Institute, which were stored in the house of an Englishman during the fall of Shanghai. They have now been taken out, most of which are instruments used in junior high schools, but they must be approved by the Ministry of Education before they can be distributed. It has been submitted to the Ministry of Education. Western children's schools should be run in accordance with Chinese education policies, but during the transition period, they will continue to operate as before. For example, the American Boys' School is entirely funded by Americans. In the future, foreigners should run schools to the point where they are supervised by Chinese. More than 50 Catholic schools have partially followed the Chinese system. The Sino-French School has not been taken over due to unclear property rights. In terms of treatment, government subsidies are limited, or tuition fees may be appropriately increased, but it should not be too much. At the same time, poor students should be given free or half-free tuition. There are plans to eliminate illiteracy. In addition to the existing public classes, it is planned to add 1,600 elementary school classes. Within this year, the number of children receiving education can be increased by 80,000, and 1,600 classes can be added for adults, with each class divided into two sessions, which can increase the number of people receiving education by 160,000. After the reply was completed, the chairman reported that the first group will hold a committee meeting in the auditorium this morning to review matters related to civil affairs, autonomy, and security, and the third group will hold a committee meeting in the auditorium to review matters related to education and culture. The second group will hold a committee meeting in the rest room to review matters related to finance, economy, and construction. However, news reporters are not allowed to participate. In the afternoon, there will be the sixth general assembly, and the Land Administration Bureau will report.</p>
<h3>Councilor Xi and Others Propose Extending the Exchange Period for Puppet Currency</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Council Vice-Chairman Xi Yushu and councilors Xu Yongzuo, Wang Bing, Luo Qinghua, Lü Entan and others have proposed that because the area is vast and the amount of puppet currency is huge, the deadline for exchanging it should be extended to alleviate the hardships of the people. It is reported that the Finance Bureau has sent a telegram to the municipal government. It is also heard that the deadline for the puppet currency can be extended to the end of May.</p>
<p>Councilors Zhan Wenhua, Shu Xincheng, etc. requested the municipal government to cooperate with the garrison headquarters to quickly investigate all the houses occupied in the city, and distribute them fairly to the citizens to alleviate the most severe housing shortage in the city at present.</p>
<h3>Zhao Zhiyou Was Buried Yesterday</h3>
<p>Provisional Councilor Zhao Zhiyou passed away on the 28th of last month. At 9:30 AM yesterday morning, Zhao's family members and relatives and friends held a memorial mass at the Catholic Church on Luban Road, and then his body was taken to the Lujiawan Cemetery for burial.</p>

<h3>Speculation Gangs Stirring After Long Inactivity: Gold Prices Rising Again; High and Low Prices Differ by 160,000</h3>
<p>Gold, after a long period of decline, suddenly rebounded yesterday, turning from falling to rising. The main reason is that the nationalization of gold may take a considerable period of time, and the Bank of China's allocation price is not cheap. It is rumored that there is considerable replenishment in secret. In addition, the weather has been sunny in recent days, and the actual sales of jewelry stores have turned strong. There is considerable replenishment in the black market. Moreover, foreign goods are pouring in. In order to save the business community, there are rumors of resetting the exchange rate against the US dollar. Speculators, after a long period of inactivity, are stirring and becoming active again. The confidence of all parties has turned firm. Initially, inheriting the weakness of the previous day, Tianjin gangs and securities firms dumped gold, once breaking the 1.4 million mark, seeing a low of 1.38 million yuan. Soon, gold buyers emerged one after another. At noon, it entered a good state, jumping out of the 1.5 million yuan mark, rising by 160,000 yuan, reaching 1.54 million yuan. The price at noon was slightly reduced. The momentum in the afternoon was even more stable. In the end, it was raised by 60,000 to 70,000 yuan. Gold jewelry was listed at 165,000 yuan, silver ingots at 1,600 yuan, and silver dollars at around 1,050 yuan.</p>
<h3>Rumors That the US Exchange Rate Will Be Relaxed: US Dollars Turn Firm From Weakness; Hong Kong Notes Also Rebound</h3>
<p>Foreign currencies, US dollars, also followed the rise in gold, turning firm from weakness. The Bank of China's exchange rate against the US dollar is still 2,020 yuan. It is rumored that it may be relaxed this month. Confidence is strong. At the slightest problem, it rose from 1,860 yuan to around 1,950 yuan, rising by 70 yuan. Hong Kong notes are also stable. Old notes rose by 5 yuan, and new notes rose by 20 to 25 yuan. Telegraphic transfers to Hong Kong and Robbie are still as stable as before.</p>
<h3>Unified C Bond Continues to Fall</h3>
<p>Falling by 1,000 yuan in two days</p>
<p>Yesterday, the public debt market was still weak and unable to rise. Confidence was dispersed. Unified C bonds fell from 2,880 yuan to 2,420 yuan. When it was learned that the stock market had turned firm, the decline stopped at noon, but it still fell by 450 yuan. A, B, D, and E bonds were each 150 yuan lower, and the volume of transactions was very small.</p>
<h3>Chinese Stocks Turn From Falling to Rising: Jewish Merchants Form Dummy Companies to Short Foreign Stocks</h3>
<p>Chinese stocks turned from falling to rising. The intention of the Sichuan gang to sell weakened. Speculators held chips and the atmosphere of selling short turned to lifting. The bulls once again used their old trick of pushing up prices. Moreover, the decline was too rapid. The rebound was also expected. The morning opening inherited the weakness of the previous day. There were only sellers and no buyers, forming a one-sided situation. Under the selling pressure of gold merchants, Wingson Yarn fell from 4,800 to 4,200, American Asiatic dropped from 3,800 to 3,200, King Fook fell to 320 yuan, New Kwong approached the 300 yuan mark, Kin Hing was at 220, Wing Fung at 1,200 yuan, and Sun Wah at 780 yuan. After 11 o'clock, the selling pressure from the Sichuan gang and short sellers weakened. After the price dropped, there was considerable absorption from outside investors. The price of gold rebounded very quickly, and securities firms rose up to lift prices. By noon, they had risen by about half. After the buying momentum was activated in the afternoon, the bulls competed to buy, pushing prices higher and higher. King Fook rebounded to the 400 yuan mark. The last price for yarn factories was 4,900, and American Asiatic was 3,900, which was slightly higher than the last price of the previous day. Among foreign stocks, only Cheung Tai Timber was still strong, with transactions at 7,000 yuan. It is rumored that Jardine Matheson and British American Tobacco have Jewish merchants forming dummy companies to dump their inventory, and prices have fallen by 10% to 20%.</p>
<h3>Yarn Market Still Depressed: Spot Cotton Transactions Also Decrease</h3>
<p>The yarn market was still lifeless yesterday. The main reason is that sales to customers were still weak. There were only a few transactions in Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou. Small factories were eager to sell, and had to depreciate prices to accommodate. For example, 20-count Double Phoenix Camel brand was reduced to 840,000, and there were some transactions. 20-count Double Horse closed at 1.11 million, down another 40,000. Prices of other brands fell by 20,000 to 30,000. The trend is still depressed. The Building Materials Company sold cotton cloth and American cotton cloth as usual yesterday.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the New York American cotton price rose by 25 to 6 pounds. The price was about 37.79 USD, Metterlin spot price 28.34 USD. The Mukden spot cotton market was steady, but transactions were greatly reduced. The price of foreign cotton rebounded sharply, and some merchants holding spot goods raised prices, making negotiations difficult to approach. The Jianfang Company also maintained a wait-and-see attitude. The private Zhongxin No. 2 factory had purchased about 102,000 USD at the Metterlin price 83,000 USD. The above prices are factory prices. The price of Brazilian cotton was 78,000 to 80,000 yuan, which is the price for delivery at the dock.</p>
<h3>Woolen Fabric Orders Too High</h3>
<p>The woolen fabric market was still stable yesterday. Due to the depletion of inventory, the standard selling price of the China Textile Corporation has risen and not fallen. Moreover, they are all goods sold in autumn and winter, making it difficult to expect cheap prices. Fellow merchants have greatly increased their orders from British, American, and Polish foreign firms, such as French flannel, Harris tweed, various types of woolen cloth, and worsted fabric. The price ranges from 3.8 USD to 15 USD per yard. For most foreign orders, a 30% down payment is required. The shipping period is divided into July, August, and September. It is said that there are many non-down payment orders.</p>
<h3>Tea Market Slump Has Not Ended</h3>
<p>The demand for Chinese tea is still very urgent in European and American countries. However, currently, because the new tea has not yet appeared on the market, and the old tea has been shelved for many years, its quality is inevitably changing. It is no longer suitable for their tastes. Currently, foreign articles should be urgently needed. It is heard that the New York Chechang has ordered more than 100,000 pounds of black tea from Taiwan and Ceylon. As for the tea market in this city, both this street and the sales to other areas were extremely stagnant. Only those who profit by depreciating sales are pouring in. In short, as the Mingqian Longjing tea in Wenzhou is about to be launched, fellow merchants have no intention of doing business with old goods, causing transactions to slump. The market sentiment is unusually inflated, and the slump in Qimen tea is even more intense, with each load falling below 120,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Lake Silk and Pig Bristles Shipped to the United States; Large Quantities of Relief Supplies Shipped to Taiwan and Qingdao</h3>
<p>A large batch of silk and wool was shipped to the United States. The China Post ship of the Fuk Lai Shipping Company, left Shanghai at 1:00 PM yesterday and sailed directly to Seattle. It was loaded with more than 200 bales of Lake Silk, more than 1,700 pieces of pig bristles, and about 300 pieces of cowhide and chicken/duck feathers for shipment to the United States. A large number of relief supplies were shipped to Taiwan and Qingdao. The Ninghai ship of the Taikoo Company sailed from Shanghai to Qingdao yesterday morning, transporting more than 28,000 bags of flour and more than 3,000 pieces of old clothes and shoes. The Haichen ship of the China Merchants Bureau is scheduled to sail to Haiphong today, passing by Taiwan, with a large number of relief flour, 100,000 bags, and 30,000 bags of regular flour, being shipped to Keelung.</p>
<h3>White Tung Oil in Zhejiang Is Popular; Hankou Tung Oil Is Still Fair</h3>
<p>White tung oil has seen repeated improvements in the market due to the lack of sources from Zhejiang and Hangzhou. Recently, the price in Hangzhou has increased to 72,000-73,000 yuan. However, for foreign trade, it is only sold for 74,000-75,000 yuan for delivery at the dock, so it has not been able to get closer. However, recently, there has been a continuous arrival of goods from Hankou, from dozens to hundreds of barrels, arriving intermittently. The price of 70,000 yuan is still worth it, so exports are continuous and there are some transactions. The current focus of various firms has shifted from Zhejiang tung oil to Hankou tung oil. However, the transportation between Shanghai and Hankou is not smooth, because the number of transport ships is not complete, and the schedule is not fixed. Although there are arrivals, they are always intermittent. If shipping can be restored, the source can be more abundant.</p>
<h3>Good News for Price Stabilization: Rice Prices Continue to Fall; Coarse Grains and Oil Cakes Are All Weak</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the supply of rice to the market continued. Actual sales at stores were weak. Moreover, domestic prices reported a decline, so confidence was unusually weak. Both japonica and indica rice fell by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. White Yin Yuan rice was weak and lacked transactions, falling another 2,000 to 3,000 yuan. Flour was very slow to move, continuing to fall by 500 yuan. The oil market saw a gradual increase in arrivals from Qingdao, and stores took a wait-and-see attitude. Moreover, the Enemy Property Management Office continued to issue price-stabilized oils, and the price was still about 10% off, so confidence was not strong and continued to fall sharply by 3,000 to 4,000 yuan. The arrival and inventory of soybeans were abundant, and there were no buyers, falling sharply by more than 1,000 yuan. Bean cakes followed suit by 500 yuan, and bran also fell by 200 to 300 yuan. Raw peanuts were also the same. The downstream of each commodity stopped rising and fell back, and prices were weak by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. Cotton cakes also fell by 500 yuan. Red beans were originally a specialty, but now, because Little Luzon is slightly more efficient, they are temporarily stable.</p>
<p>In addition, according to market information, a total of more than 9,000 shi of eight types of white japonica rice arrived in the city yesterday. The types and shi are as follows: White japonica 4,797 shi, thin rice 1,749 shi, early rice 1,905 shi, mutton indica 160 shi, Du indica 538 shi, Wu indica 175 shi, white yuan 115 shi, yin yuan 70 shi.</p>
<h3>Coal Prices Falling Frequently</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the coal market was consistently sluggish, and the market gradually softened. White coal, sieved and ash coal sellers kept coming, but buyers were hesitant. The market collapsed unilaterally. Bituminous coal, sieved and lump coal also fell because of the small number of arrivals. Bituminous coal dross was still hovering in a soft range.</p>
<h3>Brunner Mond Has Shipments; Caustic Soda Offered at Low Prices</h3>
<p>A large batch of American caustic soda arrived in Shanghai. The Bund docks were lined up in a long snake formation, as reported yesterday. It is now heard that Brunner Mond will have shipments, with each barrel only costing 60,000 yuan, which is much cheaper than the market price, so the trend is very sluggish. However, it is heard that the inventory in Shanghai is very low, and the demand from factories is very large, so although there are continuous arrivals, the market will not plummet.</p>
<h3>Summary of Business Conditions</h3>
<p>Sugar: Yesterday, the Enemy Property Management Bureau released 3,000 pieces of medium sugar, with a price of 48,000 yuan per load. In addition, arrivals were continuous, and the market became even more unsustainable. Most prices tended to fall. Only Dutch red sugar rose by 2,000 yuan due to the depletion of inventory.</p>
<p>Cotton Cloth: The cotton cloth market was still hovering. The reason is that the Textile Company is still selling a lot, fellow merchants are timid, and customer gangs are waiting and watching because ships are scarce and transportation is difficult.</p>
<p>Silk: The price of rayon fell again under the distribution of the Jianfang Company. Confidence in factory silk was firm, and prices rose slightly. The silk market saw a sharp drop in gold prices in the morning, and speculators panicked and sought to sell. American Asiatic quilt covers fell by 70,000 yuan. Dachang quilt covers also fell by 60,000 yuan. Dachang blue crepe fell by 222 yuan, falling below cost. Later, due to the rebound in gold prices, it became slightly firmer.</p>
<p>President Chiang previously inspected Nanjing, Beijing, Shanghai, and other places, and knew that food prices were soaring and people were struggling to survive. He has telegraphed to all provinces and cities that the hoarded grain that has been confiscated should be sold at stabilized prices to help the people.</p>

<h3>Recovery of Shenyang</h3>
<p>— This Newspaper's Air Dispatch on the 26th Correspondent Han Qingtao</p>
<p>After the National Army entered and garrisoned the city of Shenyang, the citizens felt relieved. The receiving members of the "Liaoning Provincial Branch of the Northeast Enemy and Puppet Enterprise Communist Unity Procurement and Receiving Committee" also arrived in numbers of over two hundred, and tensely began the receiving work, and the atmosphere was renewed!</p>
<p>The Sorrow of Tiexi Factories The Tiexi District factories are an important target, and the mining and industrial group of the unified receiving branch immediately dispatched personnel to investigate and carry out the receiving work. After working for a week in the dilapidated and incomplete factory buildings, everyone felt very distressed.</p>
<p>The large chimneys of several factories were smoking, including two breweries and a soap factory. At the entrance of the soap factory, the sign "Qiulin Company Manchurian Grease Factory" was hung, and armed Russians were guarding it, not allowing the receiving personnel to enter. The brewery was also labeled as a "Qiulin Foreign Firm" factory.</p>
<p>The wooden signs of "Xingye Enterprise Company" were hung in front of more than twenty incomplete factories. It is said that it was a masterpiece of someone joining with "the original factory owners. Among these twenty or so, some were completely empty, and the remaining items were discarded everywhere, sometimes taken away by people.</p>
<p>In an "Electrical Material Factory" the main machinery had been moved away, and the warehouse still had electrical materials, children could carry away a bag, several people from a certain paper mill pushed carts inside to find papermaking materials, and there was also a "Tractor Manufacturing Factory", there was also a lot of remaining metal materials, which needed armed protection.</p>
<p>"Hanzhou Chemical Factory" one making lubricating oil, one making , was received by the "China Changchun Railway", who sent a Soviet to be the director of the factory, with a Japanese as the deputy. The Japanese sent two Japanese women to accompany the director for fun. The director was not at the factory for five days, and the deputy director was also not often there, resulting in a fire, and causing great losses. This happened two days ago, and the embers have not yet cooled.</p>
<p>The Tiexi District factory chimneys are lined up, some factory buildings only have a shell left, there are still disputes for the complete or factories that could possibly be pieced together to be restored. Unified receiving personnel are planning a reasonable solution.</p>
<p>Struggles for Property and Houses When the Unified Receiving Branch sent someone to receive property and houses, there were already two or three seals on the doors and windows. In some places, it was "You stick, I tear, I stick, he tears", the enemy smiled gleefully, but the people cried for the motherland.</p>
<p>These are mostly the work of military organs, but some people are asking, why do they need those houses? But how can ordinary people figure out this problem, so everyone is just confused.</p>
<p>Many businesses, and many non-essential military organs or are competing to receive business venues, large and small, and have started business. We can only hope that they will temporarily run the "received" business departments well, and reasonably give them up in the future.</p>
<p>The receiving ugly dramas of Shanghai, Nanjing, and other places are also being performed in Shenyang, which is really even more distressing. Fortunately, some people are criticizing it, which is better than inside the pass. To what extent it is better is impossible to estimate.</p>
<p>The Headquarters and the Chief's Office are paying serious attention to this issue. In addition to restraining subordinates, they have specially formed a unified receiving agency with the receiving personnel from the economic, transportation, government and other departments, which is the "Liaoning Provincial Branch of the Northeast Enemy and Puppet Enterprise and American Assets Unified Receiving Committee" established in Jinzhou on March 16.</p>
<p>The unified receiving organization includes eighteen groups: military and political, educational, industrial and mining, financial and financial, social, agricultural and forestry, transportation, water conservancy, judicial, material, internal affairs, grain administration, health, publicity, relief, supervision, general affairs, and accounting. However, the personnel in some groups are not yet complete.</p>
<p>The people of Shenyang are all wide-eyed, watching the work of the unified receiving branch, hoping that it will accomplish its mission in a beautiful and reasonable manner. The people attach great importance to the people sent by the central government. They express their welcome and see the people of the Northeast as great and capable. How can we bear to disappoint them!</p>
<p>The Lovely People The absolute majority of people overvalue everything from the central government. They study in secret and treat the people sent by the government with sincerity, which can be seen anytime and anywhere. They have an even more enthusiastic love for the National Army. After the National Army entered the city, the people deduced that a large number of National Army must have arrived, so they automatically went to the Huanggu Village station with national flags to welcome the National Army. This time, when the National Army advanced north along the railway, the people in the Tie Ling area "treated them like family". It is hoped that this precious love will continue forever.</p>
<p>The staff who worked in the puppet Manchurian period, no matter what, must be used well. People from the original business organs cannot be considered completely unreliable, because their patriotic familiarity is too high, sometimes even higher than everything the overseas Chinese have shown in the past. At the same time, they also know too much, or even exceed the receiving personnel. They are the most ideal people to help with the receiving, not the people being received. Receiving personnel in various departments cannot discriminate against the original employees, otherwise there will be great losses. The reporter saw their doubts and heard their complaints. This point of emotion is the haze in work, and it must be eliminated and clarified.</p>
<p>The people of the Northeast are loving the motherland. Young students are competing to join the army. Ice and snow cannot suppress the fire of height familiarity. Unreasonable "receiving" is to stain their blank minds, causing others to laugh and making themselves cry. Success and failure are all gathered on this point! (Sent from Shenyang on March 26)</p>

<h3>Three Months of Hardships While Waiting for a Ship in Shanghai: Light Rain and Dust, Great Keelung</h3>
<p>— Air Dispatch from Taiwan by the Newspaper on the 21st: Tongqiu</p>
<p>For a month, continuous rain has controlled the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, and Shanghai is no exception. It seems that God is making it difficult for the Shanghai people who love to enjoy life, imprisoning you in the house during the beautiful spring scenery, unable to be immersed in the embrace of nature.</p>
<p>But the most troubled are the personnel going to work in Taiwan, including the Education Department, Industry and Mining Department, Transportation Department, Agriculture and Forestry Department, Court, Post-War Relief Agency, Trade Bureau, Resources Committee, Post and Telecommunications Management Council, and various units of the Taiwan Provincial Government, etc. Except for the heads of each unit and some technical personnel who took a plane to Taiwan, all of us, about two thousand people, have been hired in Shanghai since the end of last year, waiting for a ship to go to Taiwan, and the waiting has been three months, causing our enthusiasm to serve the country to be reduced again and again, almost falling into disappointment. Does the government not have a ship? Is maritime transport not open? Is it difficult to合 like the "?!"? The facts tell us that none of these are true. We know that Taiwan urgently needs us to go to organize and construct it, but we cannot go there for a while, instead staying in Shanghai to wait.</p>
<p>Eating and Spending All Shanghai is not a place for ordinary people to live well. During the three months, the price of a meal has risen from one hundred to eight hundred, and the price of a hotel has risen from five hundred to three thousand yuan per day. The cost of living has soared six or seven times. Therefore, the comrades waiting for the ship, those who live close to home, constantly go home to take things. Those who have relatives and friends in Shanghai also borrow again and again. Those who have no relatives or friends are really eating and spending all. Although the Governor-General's Office has issued a settlement allowance and a pre-borrowed fee, how can more than one hundred thousand yuan support personal expenses for three months, let alone talk about settling down?</p>
<p>Like Escaping "When the mountains and rivers are exhausted and there is no road, there is a village with dark willows and bright flowers". We were disappointed with "Hai Xiang", "Taipei", and "Hai Yu", but we got "Hai Zhou". Finally, we boarded the ship on the 18th, and set sail at noon on the 19th, and sailed out of the Yangtze River estuary at 4:30. This ship was recently bought from the United States, and is one of the ten Liberty ships, with a deadweight of 10,000 tons. It is the first time it has sailed since being received by the China Merchants Bureau. Moreover, it was originally a cargo ship, but now it has been converted into a passenger ship, and there is no equipment to speak of. More than two thousand people are trapped in five large common cabins, with bedding closely connected. To get in and out, people have to trample on each other. The quilts, boxes, and sundry goods that pass by are piled around the berths in a mess, and are often kicked over. Many comrades shouted loudly: "We are simply escaping, isn't this like a refugee camp?"</p>
<p>Appreciating the Sea View for the First Time In fact, we are lucky to be living in a common cabin, because there are thirty people who are actually hiding in the slightly hidden places on the deck and corridors. On the first night, the wind and rain were strong, and they had to try the primitive life of human beings. Only a very small number of businessmen, actually "favored by heaven", paid a price of 100,000 yuan to live in the five or six rooms on the boat.</p>
<p>The wind was strong and strong on the night of the 19th, and the ship shook greatly. On the morning of the 20th, however, the wind was calm and the waves were calm. At noon, the sun shone brightly, reflecting the green sea water and embellished with flocks of white gulls, a beautiful picture, which was really moving. The deck was crowded with people, talking and laughing, eating and drinking, or leaning against the railing to look into the distance, as if all the troubles were forgotten.</p>
<p>Keelung in Sight On the 21st, the people on the ship said: "We can arrive at noon today. Sure enough, after ten o'clock, the island of Taiwan was faintly visible, but the Public Service always gave us trouble, with drizzling rain, without stopping. The fog shrouded the mountains and waters, and the telescope was ineffective. At eleven o'clock, we entered the port of Keelung, and at twelve o'clock, we berthed, the journey was exactly forty-eight hours. Keelung is an excellent military port, surrounded by mountains on all sides, and the scenery is comparable to Qingdao. At the pier, each unit had receptionists holding signs, and the situation was very lively. So we got on the four trucks of the Taipei County Government's receptionists and drove straight to Taipei.

<h3>The 15th Session of the Political Participation Council Passes a Second Discussion on the Education Report (Continued)</h3>
<p>(II) The Ministry of Education should already have rewards for accomplished researchers who have written and invented works. However, research work requires a lot of real costs. The amount of the reward is too small to be useful. Researchers should be allowed to list their work plans and budgets, which will be reviewed by the Central Research Institute's Review Council or the Academic Review Committee of the Ministry of Education. If they are recognized as having sufficient research capabilities, their work plans are applicable, and their work is particularly important, and the research costs are absolutely beyond the capacity of individuals, all their work expenses will be funded by the state.</p>
<p>(III) The funding of independent research institutes and university research institutes should be increased as much as possible to facilitate development. As for research students, they are excellent members of university graduates, and their treatment should be similar to that of teaching assistants in order to study with peace of mind. However, the current treatment is that teaching assistants are staff members and can receive 50,000 yuan per month, while research students are students and only receive 6,000 yuan per month for meals and 1,500 yuan for living allowances. This is not even enough to fill their stomachs. We should adopt measures to stabilize their lives and encourage their desire to learn.</p>
<p>(IV) The mission of secondary school teachers is not only to educate young people but also to gradually improve themselves to prepare for becoming university professors. However, the departments set up in normal colleges are too simple, such as history and geography being combined into one department, or physics, chemistry, or natural history being combined into one department. Graduates have limited knowledge and have no ability to study in depth. The normal colleges affiliated to universities have more complete departments set up by the universities to adjust the situation, which can avoid this problem. However, independent normal colleges do not have this convenience and must allocate sufficient funds to set up various departments so that graduates can have complete knowledge and a foundation for further study.</p>
<p>(V) The Continental Scientific Academy established by the enemy and puppets in Northeast China took the natural resources of Northeast China as the object of its research and the development and utilization of Northeast China as the purpose of its research, including geology, chemistry, industry, medicine, and dozens of subjects, which were connected with each other to form a highly systematic organization. The central government should order the Ministry of Education to reorganize it into the National Northeast Research Institute to maintain its original integrity.</p>
<p>(D) Social Education</p>
<p>(I) The best tools for promoting social education are radio and film. China lacks material resources, and radios are only used for entertainment by the rich. In remote provinces, some counties do not have a single radio, and news is blocked, making them seem like they are at the ends of the earth. Films are only available in large cities, and there are countless villagers who have never seen a screen in their lives. It is extremely difficult to develop social education in this way. From now on, the Ministry of Education should pay attention to this matter and do its best to promote it. It should sign a special contract with wireless equipment factories to ensure that radios are sold at extremely low prices and distributed widely. It should also produce a large number of films with practical scientific knowledge and distribute them to cities and villages for rotating screenings so that the people can all recognize modern culture and know their own responsibilities. We should especially promote or improve spoken dramas and Peking operas, which have the largest number of audiences.</p>
<p>(II) In addition to focusing on advanced research, scientific development should also constantly improve the level of scientific knowledge of the people. Museums use real objects as teaching materials and have the most significant effect on popularizing scientific knowledge. The Ministry of Education should be requested to order the provincial and municipal governments to first establish museums in cities with a population of over one million, such as Nanjing, Chongqing, Shanghai, Peiping, Tianjin, Guangzhou, and Shenyang, and then gradually promote them in other places. (III) There are tens of thousands of Chinese characters, and many of them have complex strokes, making them inconvenient to write and learn. If they are not thoroughly reorganized, it will be extremely difficult to promote education. Although the Ministry of Education has set up a National Language Promotion Committee, its task focuses on promoting phonetic symbols and unifying pronunciation. It has not yet had time to reorganize the characters. However, since the late Qing Dynasty, there have been many people who have advocated simplified characters, and there are still many people who specialize in this issue. To promote popular education, it is appropriate to accept their achievements and jointly seek a standardized approach. The Ministry of Education should be requested to convene experts as soon as possible to hold a National Character Reorganization Conference to determine concrete plans. If a long-term review is required, a National Character Reorganization Committee should be established. (IV) The tripods, sacrificial vessels, and other items preserved in the Confucius Temple and the official residence in Qufu are invaluable treasures of Chinese culture. Recently, it was reported that after the Communist troops occupied Qufu, they were all taken away and transported to Teng County. These thousands of years of cultural relics have suffered such a catastrophe. If they are not recovered as soon as possible, the loss will be too great and will never be compensated. The Ministry of Education is requested to find ways to recover them and preserve them.</p>
<p>(E) Education in Border Areas and for Overseas Chinese</p>
<p>(I) The people in the border areas are too isolated from modern culture. If teachers do not learn to adapt to them and forget the distinction between themselves and the people, they will be working in vain. The first step is to learn their language and communicate their emotions. All courses should be taught in the local dialect of the border areas as a principle. However, how to train such teachers is something that the Ministry of Education should consider as soon as possible.</p>
<p>(II) The Ministry of Education has set up border construction courses and lectures in various universities, which is enough to arouse the attention of young people in the inland and border areas to the border areas, which is essential. However, seeing only a part of the leopard is not enough to satisfy those who aspire to study in depth. It is hoped that preparations will be made for expansion so that these schools can all establish specialized departments or specialized schools in the future and become centers for studying the border areas.</p>
<p>(III) Overseas Chinese have a deep love for their country and are most devoted to nationalism. Therefore, education for overseas Chinese should focus on instilling knowledge of Chinese history, geography, and cultural heritage so that their emotions can be guided by reason.</p>
<p>(IV) In the past, the agencies guiding education for overseas Chinese were not unified, and it was often difficult to handle affairs. In the future, the government should handle them in a unified manner so that there is a standard to follow.</p>
<p>(F) Other Matters</p>
<p>(I) Recently, many political groups have tried to use students as tools for their political disputes, resulting in many students abandoning their studies and rushing into the path of agitation, which is extremely distressing. The Ministry of Education is requested to strictly reiterate the ban that no political group may engage in political struggles in schools to avoid sacrificing the most precious time for students to study. Only then can the academic atmosphere gradually become solemn, and the foundation for students' studies can be laid.</p>
<p>(II) In addition to providing for living expenses, the income of each teacher must also be used to purchase reference research materials and make academic trips, which is not comparable to that of ordinary civil servants who only need to handle affairs. At present, prices are soaring, and not only is there no way to talk about studying, but even the minimum living standards are becoming increasingly difficult to maintain. The government is requested to realistically improve treatment with reference to the price index.</p>
<p>(III) It is inappropriate for the state to set up schools to educate talents and then collect tuition fees in the same way as private schools. Although in practice, most schools no longer charge tuition fees, since there is no explicit abolition order, remote provinces and counties may continue to charge fees according to惯例, which is far from uniform and not the way to govern. The Ministry of Education is requested to order all national and public schools at all levels throughout the country to no longer collect tuition fees. As for private schools, the maximum amount of tuition fees should also be restricted according to the situation in various places.</p>
<p>(IV) Cultural cooperation between countries should first pay attention to the selection of personnel. Those who are sent to Europe and the United States to give lectures should pay special attention to promoting China's inherent culture. As for the natural sciences, they must have sufficient research and definite inventions before they can be assigned to lecturing work. (Central News Agency, Chongqing, 1st dispatch.

<p>Draft Design of Yichang Sluice Gate</p>
<p>The Yichang Sluice Gate is an unprecedentedly huge project and the largest facility in China's plan to rebuild the Yangtze River Basin. Once this sluice gate is completed, it will have a significant effect on water conservancy (including flood control and irrigation, hydropower) and agricultural benefits. This design and engineering have been contracted by our government and the US government and is expected to begin soon. The white line in the picture shows the power plant built by striking the mountain. The water of the Yangtze River will be injected into the power plant from the reservoir through the tunnel and then poured into the main stream of the Yangtze River and its tributaries on both sides.</p>
<h3>Glimpses of Chen Gongbo Before the Trial</h3>
<p>— A dispatch from our Suzhou, 30th correspondent, Qingping</p>
<p>The traitor and giant villain Chen Gongbo, in the autumn when the Japanese army was approaching, did not regard the country as important, did not cherish the nation, only cared about his personal welfare for a while, willingly colluded with the traitor Wang Zhaoming to collaborate with the enemy and betray the country, colluded with "the bandits," and engaged in the treacherous activities of selling out the country for personal gain and leaving a stinking name for ten thousand years. He successively served as the President of the Legislative Yuan of the puppet government, a Central Committee member of the puppet party, and the Mayor of the puppet Shanghai. Finally, he achieved his greatest desire and served as the Chairman of the puppet National Government. However, during his term of office in the puppet government, no government order was not to sell out the country and harm the people. His ten major crimes have been filed by Han Tao, the chief prosecutor of the High Procuratorate, to the Criminal Court of the High Court on the 18th of this month, and President Sun has scheduled a public trial at 1:00 pm on April 5th. Before the trial, some fragments about him are collected below;</p>
<p>Punishing traitors was originally intended to revive national morale and warn the world. However, Chen Gongbo's biography is that of a traitor and giant villain with heinous crimes. He did not hesitate to sell out the country and the nation. This time, he received sanctions from the national law, which he deserved. Therefore, the Central Propaganda Department, in order to widely publicize and warn the world, specially dispatched the Central Film Production Company to film Chen Ni's interrogation and screen it in various places. Filming in the courtroom is considered to have started with Chen Ni in our country. In the future, people from all over the world will also be able to see Chen Ni's true face.</p>
<p>This major treason case caused a sensation at home and abroad. This time, the Jiangsu High Court opened the trial in Suzhou. The High Court made strict arrangements in advance. In order to avoid accidents and maintain order in the courtroom, the number of observers in the courtroom was carefully considered. Therefore, only 200 observer passes were prepared, including 56 for reporters from newspapers along the Beijing-Shanghai Line, and the rest were for officials from various agencies. The court stated that the number of passes was limited and that registration was required in advance by letter. The passes have been issued since the 28th until they are exhausted. According to Secretary-General Yang, foreign capital will observe the trial on that day. The court hopes that observers must strictly abide by the observer rules when the trial begins in order to maintain the dignity of the court and show the demeanor of our great citizens abiding by public order.</p>
<p>Chen Ni Gongbo's trial judge was President Sun Honglin of the High Court, who personally served as the presiding judge. Presiding Judge Shi Meiyu served as the chief judge, and Judge Kong Rongzhao served as the accompanying judge. Clerks Qin Daoli and Cai Yiting served as recorders. The High Court considered the news reporters most carefully. In order to make it easier for reporters to hear clearly and record, the news reporter seats were set up on both sides of the judge's bench. Of course, the security was tight during this trial, and those without observer passes were absolutely refused entry into the court. The court specially prepared a car to escort Chen Ni into the courtroom for trial.</p>

<h3>Letter from the Salt Administration</h3>
<p>March 7th To Your Newspaper Office,</p>
<p>Your newspaper's editorial on March 7th included sections that involved salt administration. I am writing to clarify the facts separately below, and I respectfully hope that you will understand. Your newspaper stated: "The price of salt has increased in various places, and there is a salt shortage everywhere, but the salt produced in the producing areas cannot be sold externally, resulting in many salt farmers abandoning salt production and turning to other industries." This may be a portrayal of the salt administration during the enemy and puppet period. After the victory, coastal producing areas sought to restore salt production. In addition to following the established policy of opening up sales markets and encouraging free trafficking so that any merchant could go to the fields or warehouses at key distribution points to purchase salt according to regulations for transportation and sale, this bureau also established a supervision office in Shanghai, where officials and merchants worked together to actively transport salt from the salt fields in Fujian, Zhejiang, Huai, and Lu provinces, concentrating it in Shanghai and transferring it to the sales areas according to their needs. Currently, within the scope of this bureau's jurisdiction, we have not heard of any salt shortages leading to famine. As for the salt fields that this agency has not yet taken over due to special political circumstances, if there is a situation of "salt production cannot be sold externally and salt farmers have turned to other industries," the responsibility for this cannot be borne by this agency. Please conduct a detailed investigation to clarify the truth. Furthermore, the increase in salt prices is purely due to the impact of general price increases. However, the increase index is actually below that of general prices, and the increase rate is not as drastic as the fluctuations in general prices. Taking rice as an example, before the war, rice cost about 10 yuan per shi (unit of dry measure) and salt cost about 10 yuan per dan (another unit of dry measure) in the Beijing-Shanghai area. Now, rice in Beijing costs 24,000 yuan per shi, an increase of more than 2,000 times, while salt costs 11,000 yuan per dan, an increase of more than 1,000 times. If we further calculate the burden on the people, ordinary people need more than 30 jin (unit of weight) of rice per month, which costs about 6,000 yuan, and about 12 liang (another unit of weight) of salt, which costs only more than 100 yuan. Comparing the two, the relationship between them and people's livelihood is self-evident. If we further analyze the factors that increase salt prices, we will know that the composition of salt prices, in addition to the amount of salt tax levied, is related to the entire national economy, which need not be elaborated. The majority of the price is for supervision and transportation costs, and these two items are closely related to general prices. In the past, the enemy puppets approved salt capital and transportation costs at the lowest possible level, but only for exploitation, and salt farmers and porters had difficulty maintaining a living, so they fled and "turned to other industries." Now, we are taking into account the overall situation. On the one hand, we do not want to make salt prices too high and increase the burden on the people. On the other hand, we make reasonable adjustments at any time according to the price increase index so that we can maintain the minimum living standards. At a time when prices are generally rising, since salt prices cannot be lowered independently, it seems unreasonable to demand a lowering of salt prices alone. As for what your newspaper calls "our traditional salt management system," it refers to the special merchant system that has been in place since the Ming and Qing dynasties. This system, as your newspaper said, "monopolizes and specializes in profits, and does not allow people to freely buy and sell." Its characteristics are monopoly of the market and exclusive profits. Its drawbacks are raising salt prices, mixing in impurities, and hindering the lives of the majority of the people. Since the Wanli period of the Ming Dynasty, it has poisoned society for more than 300 years and has long been criticized by the Chinese people. In the 20th year, the central government thoroughly reformed it, and on January 1st of that year, it announced that all special treatments and rights of the past special merchant system and other similar monopoly salt industries were abolished on the same day. After the victory, this bad "traditional system" remaining in the recovered areas should be banned and the accumulated abuses should be eliminated according to law. According to the current salt administration guidelines, everything is manufactured, transported, and sold by the people, and everything is returned to the people. Anyone who pays enough taxes can freely transport and sell without restriction. This proposition is entirely based on the principle of people's livelihood and opens the entire salt management system to the public. However, at the beginning of its implementation, we are afraid that the society still does not fully understand it, and we still hope that your newspaper will widely promote it to achieve significant results. Best regards, Salt Administration of the Ministry of Finance, to Shen Bao.</p>

<p>Spring and Autumn</p>
<h3>Mother Willow</h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>I think of my childhood, which the fleeting years have taken away, and immediately I think of Mother Willow, the kind-hearted old woman from Sanhe County, who is the person I can't forget most in my childhood memories.</p>
<p>She came to our house as a servant when I was three and a half years old. First, she took care of me, then my older younger sister, and then my younger younger sister. After my younger brother was born, she also helped the wet nurse for a while before leaving us.</p>
<p>Near the entrance of Xinmen Road, there seemed to be a large bluestone. That was the only place Mother Willow took me to play, because she was afraid my mother would worry, so she didn't dare go far. Almost every day (except, of course, on windy and rainy days), when the dazzling sun filled the ground, Mother Willow finished her morning chores and took me to the street, sitting on that large bluestone, telling old stories, jokes, watching rickshaws on the street, and pedestrians walking by. When the wind messed up my hair, she would comb small braids for me. Sometimes I became restless. When a candy blower passed by, I wanted to buy some; when a peddler of small snacks passed by, I wanted to eat some; when a dough figurine maker passed by, I wanted to play with them. Mother Willow didn't have any coins (meaning copper coins) with her, so she couldn't fulfill my wishes. I wouldn't let it go. She would say, "Let's go home to get some!" But I was afraid my mother would scold me and refused to go home. She didn't have any money, but I insisted on buying something, and after arguing to the point of helplessness, Mother Willow would say, "Little mushroom head! Please have mercy! I'm going to find a crooked-neck tree to hang myself from!" making everyone on the street laugh.</p>
<p>Before I turned four, my mother taught me to recognize two examples of square characters every day. When my mother was too busy, Mother Willow would always take over. At that time, I thought all adults were literate. It wasn't until I was a few years older that I realized that other servants weren't as literate as Mother Willow. Her father was a private tutor in the countryside of Sanhe County.</p>
<p>Later, as I learned more and more characters, sometimes I would ask her about them, and she would say she didn't know them. I found it strange. Mother Willow said, "My dad thought I was the fifth daughter, and when I was nine, he sent me to my grandmother's house. After that, no one taught me to read." Her words seemed to carry a sense of her life story.</p>
<p>She instilled many good habits in me: not biting my fingernails, not leaving food in my bowl, never interrupting when others are talking, tearing off today's page of the calendar after dinner, closing the door and turning off the lights before going to bed, rinsing my mouth with cold water... If I am still able to maintain these good habits today, I must thank Mother Willow.</p>
<p>I remember one time I lied to my mother, and Mother Willow exposed me. My mother made me kneel for a full two hours. I hated her for it and cried and made a fuss with her. She said, "A seven-year-old child lying, who will believe you when you grow up?"</p>
<p>At that time, my younger sisters had all been weaned one after another, and I had started school. She and another wet nurse took care of them. The wet nurse was an irresponsible person, so Mother Willow always kept an eye on the two children.</p>
<p>I went to school at an affiliated elementary school of a church middle school across from Qianliang Hutong. Every day after school in the afternoon, Mother Willow would push the stroller to wait for me at the gate. My younger sisters sat in the stroller, and I hung my goose-yellow schoolbag with black characters on the handle of the stroller, helping her push the stroller home together. Sometimes I would pester her to eat douzhi [fermented mung bean milk], and Mother Willow would immediately make a face, saying, "Shameless! Only wild boys eat things at street stalls! You are a young lady!" I had no choice but to give up.</p>
<p>She taught me to dye my fingernails with henna juice, but I didn't like it. What I liked was helping the coachman, Han San, clean my father's chartered car, polishing it until it was shiny enough to reflect people's faces, and I loved the smell of oil. Mother Willow laughed at me for being born a boy, without any ladylike qualities. She also taught me how to weave dog teeth and pull zippers, but I couldn't learn any of them. Finally, she sighed, shook her head, and sewed a cicada-shaped green cloth needle cushion for me, which I still keep as a memento.</p>
<p>Since my school was run by the church, we had to go to church every Sunday. The principles the teachers taught didn't interest me. I loved listening to Mother Willow's stories about the White Lotus Sect every night, so I told her, "The Jesus religion is not fun. I'd rather believe in the White Lotus Sect. I want to be able to summon wind and rain and ride on a handkerchief like riding on clouds." She solemnly told me that I couldn't, because the White Lotus Sect was an evil cult, and decent people couldn't believe in evil cults. I didn't understand what an evil cult was at that time, but the words "decent people" were deeply imprinted in my mind, and I knew I should be a decent person.</p>
<p>Mother Willow didn't have any sons, only two daughters. The older one was four years older than me and had been given to someone as a child bride. The younger one was the same age as me, named Fengniu, with a fair face and a pair of slender eyes like her mother, and her smile looked like a crescent moon on the third or fourth day of the lunar month. However, Fengniu had bound feet.</p>
<p>One time, a soldier came to our house, a very tall and strong man. He spoke to Mother Willow in a very unpleasant tone. After he left, Mother Willow cried. The wet nurse said that the soldier was Mother Willow's husband, Liu Dianlin, an idler who didn't do any honest work. When Mother Willow married him, he was a cart driver. Later, she didn't know how he became a soldier. He didn't care about anything at home and only came back when he wanted money from women.</p>
<p>We were going back to the south. My mother liked Mother Willow's loyalty, carefulness, and reliability. She planned to take her to the south. At first, she refused because she couldn't bear to part with her children. Later, Liu Dianlin came to ask for money again, and she was even beaten. That summer, she gave her youngest daughter, Fengniu, to someone else as a child bride, and decided to go south with us.</p>
<p>At first, she missed home very much, worried about Fengniu, who had just become a child bride. She also wasn't used to life in the south. We often ate dumplings, noodles, and pancakes, but it still didn't reduce her homesickness. She often said, "Now it's hard to see a courtyard house." and "On the ninth and tenth day, if we were in Beijing, we should go to Longfu Temple!" I shared her feelings because there wasn't a single time I went to Longfu Temple that she didn't accompany me.</p>
<p>When Mother Willow couldn't speak the official language, she would often grumble, "Silly southerners, still laughing at northern bumpkins!" - To be fair, Beijing dialect wasn't as common in the south back then as it is now.</p>
<p>Despite her dissatisfaction with the south, she never said a word about wanting to go back or regretting coming. Later, she gradually got used to living there, and her homesickness wasn't as strong as before. - Until I was fifteen years old, Liu Dianlin found her in the south, insisting that she go back with him. She reluctantly left us.</p>
<p>Before leaving, she gave each of the four of us siblings a gift. She stayed up all night weaving a small hair tie sleeveless shirt for my younger brother, a pair of silver bracelets for my younger sisters, and a silver thimble for me: "Fifteen years old, you should be able to use this now!" - I'm very ashamed, because to this day I still don't know how to use that thing.</p>
<p>From the time she left until now, and perhaps forever in the future, our family has never hired a better female servant than her. My mother often sighed, "When she was here, I didn't feel it. After she left, I have to put in more than double the effort." She was in our family for almost twelve years. In this era where people's hearts are unstable, it's rare to see even twelve-year-long friends, let alone twelve-year-long masters and servants. How can people not miss her? Such a kind, honest, and good-hearted old woman.</p>
<p>She used to ask someone to write letters for her, but since the "July 7th" Incident, there has been no more news from her. Is Mother Willow still alive? Or is she already gone from this world? We have no way of knowing. A few years ago, we even sent a registered letter to Sanhe County, but the original letter was returned. Even if we are in Beijing now, what can we do?</p>
<p>In my suitcase, I still keep the thimble she gave me and the cicada-shaped needle cushion made of green cloth. Whenever I see these two things, my eyes involuntarily fill with tears. In the glistening tears, it seems like I can see Mother Willow's fair and gentle face, her pair of slender eyes, her smile like a crescent moon on the third or fourth day of the lunar month... But where is she? If she is still alive today, would she also remember that child who sat on the large bluestone at the entrance of Xinmen Road, who once made her say she was going to find a crooked-neck tree to hang herself from, and is now thinking of her words and deeds from that time?</p>
<h3>Impassioned Verses: Having Been a Guest in Chongqing for a Long Time</h3>
<p>— Lumang</p>
<p>Wandering for ten thousand miles, I sigh as a lonely traveler,</p>
<p>For eight years, I have lived in Chongqing, surviving.</p>
<p>How can I bear to lean on the pillar and listen to the fish's sigh,</p>
<p>How can I help but hear the wind playing the kite's strings.</p>
<p>Dreams are unreliable, and I cannot awaken,</p>
<p>I let the wind and rain play with the clouds and sunshine.</p>
<p>Often I go up to a high building to look out,</p>
<p>Wanting to part the clouds and recognize my old home.</p>
<p>The prosperity before my eyes is not peace,</p>
<p>The new scenes do not bring joy.</p>
<p>I'd rather pierce the Red Sea with hot tears,</p>
<p>And see all living beings as straw dogs, treated the same.</p>
<p>Gaining or losing in essays, stubbornly pursuing fame,</p>
<p>Pitifully trying small skills like a fledgling insect.</p>
<p>Long songs are only fit to mourn for those deserving pity,</p>
<p>Who else can I discuss faith and loyalty with?</p>
<h3>One Night in a Mountain Town</h3>
<p>— Ling Xing</p>
<p>Living in foreign concessions for too long makes one appreciate the simplicity of mountain towns. Often with this feeling, I like to get off the train in a mountain town during my journey on the Jinpu Railway, spend the night on the earthen bed in a thatched house, and abandon all the worries of intrigue, as if finding a bit of leisure to read Tang poems in the midst of a busy schedule.</p>
<p>This time, I actually only stayed in the mountain town for one night, and it was because of a railway accident that the train couldn't run, forcing me to stay. But it sowed a long-term memory, a long-term joy. Because, I found warmth and kindness again in the human world, which many scholars who explore human nature in foreign concessions have not found, but I unexpectedly and easily found in the mountain town.</p>
<p>The train was very crowded, and there was a longer journey ahead, so I was even more unwilling to spend the night on the train. The hotels around the station were already full, so I strolled down the main road. On the road, an old man sitting on a stone step smoking a pipe looked at me, a traveler from afar, with a surprised look, and smiled, saying:</p>
<p>"Can't find a place to stay, huh?"</p>
<p>I smiled wryly, seeing a warm light shining from his wrinkled face. I haven't seen it elsewhere, but sitting behind the teacher reading "Peach Blossom Spring" in my childhood seemed similar. I asked with a respectful feeling from the bottom of my heart:</p>
<p>"Old gentleman, is there any hotel around here?"</p>
<p>He smiled innocently, patted the dirt on his body with his dry old hands and said:</p>
<p>"There weren't many hotels here originally, and they were all full as soon as the train stopped."</p>
<p>Then he sighed!</p>
<p>"It's hard to be out these days, and no wonder you young people come out to make a living. Unlike me, I'm too old to do anything but smoke a pipe."</p>
<p>That's how I was invited to the old man's house. Sitting next to the square table in his thatched cottage, I felt a little uneasy, a few polite words hesitating on my lips, the old man had already hurried out. He was still shouting:</p>
<p>"Sit down, sit down;"</p>
<p>Sitting alone in the thatched cottage, I thought this was a bit like "Catching and Releasing Cao" in the Peking Opera, Chen Gong met Lü Boshe on the road, and the old man must have gone out to buy wine. So, is there "tie him up and kill him, bind him and kill him" in the kitchen too?</p>
<p>The old man came back, but he didn't have wine in his hand, just a plate of roasted chicken, two sesame cakes, and he pushed them to me with both hands:</p>
<p>"Eat something, I'll have them cook some millet porridge, travelers should eat something light!"</p>
<p>I'm just saying this is enough, I believe kindness must widely exist in the world, and coldness must not be more than warmth. Because turning over the map, leaving the foreign concessions on the vast land of China, there are countless small cities and towns.</p>
<p>I slept very soundly on the earthen bed in the mountain town, until the next morning, when the locomotive was calling with its summoning whistle. The old man came to wake me up:</p>
<p>"It's time to hurry on your way, it's a pity I can't keep you for a few more days!"</p>
<p>He kindly sent me to the train, watching the train go away with a hopeful eye. I, in the crowd, looked out the window, the old man's white hair fluttered in the morning wind, gradually fading, and then another old man's sincere and simple shadow came up.</p>
<p>Kind-hearted people in the mountain town, may God bless you!</p>
<h3>Poet Yang Yunshi (Continued Part Two)</h3>
<p>— Tang Liyan</p>
<p>One can imagine when he was at the height of his career. Also, he gorgeously painted a red plum screen, painted four pieces through a night of spring rain, and added eight quatrains.</p>
<p>Protecting the screen, the mountain blows rain threads,</p>
<p>Upright gentlemen stand together, playing with rouge.</p>
<p>Jiang Yan's brush is still as wild as before,</p>
<p>Exhausting his long energy to paint folded branches.</p>
<p>Folding cold fragrance, the mist fills the lake,</p>
<p>Lonely Mountain, Su Xiao accompanies the forest path.</p>
<p>Lamb's wine melts the brocade tent,</p>
<p>Is it worth the unbridled Song Dynasty?</p>
<p>Spring is like the sea in the Misty Fragrance Cave,</p>
<p>Crimson brilliance can be seen before the scarlet screen.</p>
<p>Accustomed to the myriad styles of Shangyang,</p>
<p>A lifetime of joys and sorrows for plum blossoms.</p>
<p>Wang Gong walks in the snow, with all his charm,</p>
<p>The fairy Gugu descends to the ten continents.</p>
<p>I couldn't sleep last night because of the spring cold,</p>
<p>I put on sable fur.</p>
<p>The poet's bones are like clear ice,</p>
<p>Remembering the Jade Capital with rain, snow and spring lanterns.</p>
<p>Two rows of torches go to the academy,</p>
<p>The fragrance of large flowers is indistinguishable.</p>
<p>Two or three branches of sleeping Luofu Mountain,</p>
<p>The best time to view flowers is before they bloom.</p>
<p>Even if they can be picked, they shouldn't be,</p>
<p>Leave them to the east wind for good care.</p>
<p>In spring, one cherishes the fragrant beauty,</p>
<p>Flowers fill the river city, wine fills the clothes.</p>
<p>A new poem is passed on by word of mouth,</p>
<p>Every household of red powder talks about Yang Qi.</p>
<p>Yunlong has traveled the four seas,</p>
<p>Turning his head, he looked around and left the world.</p>
<p>Recently, his heroic spirit has been exhausted,</p>
<p>He only paints plum blossoms to give to beautiful women.</p>
<p>Mr. seems to cherish the plum blossoms. Except for the hundred paintings for Duke Wu of Wu, he only painted for the beautiful screen. Other poems such as "Farewell in Spring River", "Folding Willow Song", "Azalea Lyrics", "Untitled", "Intoxicated", etc. were all written for the beauty. Some sentences such as "Entering the door in the middle of the night, people are already drunk, leaning on the shadow of flowers under the carved saddle." "Unable to walk after drinking in the spring cold, the military watch in the army is already three shifts." "Why are soft words as sweet as honey? White teeth silently peel lychees." and other sentences, are all fragrant and charming to the bone. Because of this, the name of the romantic Little Du is known all over the world. Those who are jealous call Mr. a talented man from the red light district. At that time, Mr. was already fifty-two years old, not a young Pan An, nor did he have Shi Chong's Golden Valley. But the beauty was in love with each other, so he was not a mediocre person, as can be seen from the repeated requests for plum blossoms. Not long after, Duke Wu was defeated, and Mr. hurriedly left Hanyang. The beauty did her best to arrange things so that he could escape danger. Mr. wrote a farewell poem, and on the eve of his departure, A Mei asked for a painting of plums again, and wrote two of the four quatrains. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>A Pair of Lovebirds (23)</h3>
<p>— Zhao Qingge</p>
<p>Lord Weng finished speaking and drank a large glass of wine. This was a hearty drink that he had never had before.</p>
<p>"But, brother! We also have daughters in our family!" Lord Mo said in a more clear tone with a melancholic voice.</p>
<p>This time, Lord Weng did not respond. His hand suddenly trembled brightly, almost smashing the cup he was pouring wine into.</p>
<p>"Brother, I think we can't just pretend to be ignorant and let them go on like this. We have to discipline them a bit. Because, although they are the ones being talked about outside, we are the ones losing face!" Lord Ma said even more thoroughly.</p>
<p>Lord Weng smiled bitterly, shrugged his shoulders, and remained silent.</p>
<p>"Are you afraid of her?" Lord Mo couldn't help but ask.</p>
<p>Lord Weng shook his head.</p>
<p>"Then what's your opinion?"</p>
<p>Lord Weng was forced to answer by Lord Mo, so he said with a smile:</p>
<p>"I have no opinion, but I'm not afraid of her either. I really haven't heard any gossip outside, and I don't want to ask about it. Because I want to live a few more years, brother. What is more worthy of indulgence than one's own life? Therefore, not only should Bo do this, but I also advise you to do so. Don't forget, this is a new world! The emperor has been abolished, what's the point of those old rules and old etiquette? We couldn't protect the emperor's throne, and that's why we ended up in this situation. Our own titles and property are gone, what do these trivial matters matter? If you can pretend to be ignorant, it's best to pretend to be ignorant." After Lord Weng finished speaking, he drank another large glass of wine.</p>
<p>Lord Mo thought that Lord Weng's words made sense. Besides, it's really not appropriate to interfere too much in other people's affairs. Therefore, he stopped pursuing the matter.</p>
<p>"Let's drink, brother! Nowadays, this is the only way we can live with interest. Listen to me, from now on you look for happiness in the cup; I'll spend my years in bed. Let others eat chicken and watch plays; let them go. The way to maintain health is to mind your own business and not be troubled by trifles." Lord Weng finished speaking and sighed to the sky.</p>
<p>Although Lord Mo didn't quite agree with Lord Weng's words, he saw that Lord Weng's face revealed some repressed emotions. He understood that Lord Weng didn't want others to break up his misty atmosphere, "mist," which had become a barrier to his life. He admired Lord Weng's cleverness, but he couldn't use drunkenness as a barrier to his life. He would often break through the realm of "drunkenness" himself! It seemed that he was uneasy about staying in the hazy state of drunkenness for a long time!</p>
<p>Therefore, Lord Weng was happy; Lord Mo was in pain!</p>
<p>Lord Weng had already forgotten everything they had just talked about. He regained his relaxed and cheerful mood, casually talking about the past wealth and fleeting clouds; talking about the political changes like wind and rain, talking about the fleeting human relationships like flowing water and falling flowers; he told all this mistily, he enthusiastically told a mysterious and elusive misty story!</p>
<p>"Everything is like a dream, and is a dream! For example, on the day you gave birth to your daughter Hua, didn't you have a dream similar to reality? Therefore, life is a dream, and a dream is life. I didn't quite understand this question before. I remember six years ago, I advised you not to dream. But I didn't know that people live in dreams! Unless a person dies, the dream will wake up and disappear. But, since we know that life is a dream, then we should treat everything as a dream. Dreams don't last too long, so there's no need to take everything too seriously. If we can do this, people won't be troubled while they're alive."</p>
<p>Lord Weng finally spoke about the "dream" once again in a preaching tone, then yawned a few times and returned to his misty life.</p>
<p>Lord Mo was now as silent as Lord Weng was when he first came! He silently drank wine without saying a word, she temporarily was safe in the drunkenness!</p>
