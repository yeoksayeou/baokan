<h3>悼葉楚傖先生</h3>
<p>在　市歡欣鼓舞迎迓蔣主席之蒞臨聲中，而忽奉中委葉楚傖先生之噩耗。風景不異，哀樂頓殊，期待方殷，老成遽謝。是爲國家重大之損失，又豈直人情感傷之私而已。</p>
<p>先生蚤歲即主筆政，許身黨國，艱苦備嘗。平生於文學修養，造詣極深，故其下筆不能自休，發方類有感應，　轉雲湧，默化潛移，用能策革命於旣成，齊曇志而勿墜。從政而還，益爲底厲，以淸白自矢，絕錙銖之求，刻苦精神，始終如一。以才言，固政界之環寳，以資論，實報人之先進。吾人忝附同業，曾挹光采，方欲引厥準繩，永資模式，何意國土纔慶重光，一瞑遂以不視。觸緒紛乘，彌難爲懷矣。</p>

<h3>主席昨召見杜月笙等　對物價有所指示　並剴切訓勉黨團軍警同志</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕主席蒞滬昨為第五日，忙於處理公務，接見賓客及出席各項招待歡迎會，查旰勤勞，迄無餘閒。昨晨復召見杜月笙，王曉籟，陳霆銳，徐寄廎，吳蘊初，蔣廷黻，彭學沛，丁貴堂，顔惠慶，孫鶴臯等，對抑平本市物價問題有重要指示，並聽取各人之工作報告。十二時半赴三民主義青年團上海支團部，向本市黨部全體黨員，駐軍各部隊團長以上軍官，市警察局分局長以上警官，三民主義靑年團團員等共計五千餘人剴切致訓詞，歷時三刻鐘之久。語多勗勉，其要點有三：（一）黨團同志應加強基層組織及基層工作，（二）服從命令，嚴守紀律，有忍耐精神。（三）藥為民眾服務，為社會服務，知廉恥，努力奮鬥，完成建國使命。至一時二十分訓話完畢，全場高呼萬歲，情緒乏熱烈興奮，得未曾有。一時三十五分主席返回官邸，二時四十分左右，上海市婦女新生活運動促進會代表汪蔚丹，蕭粹賢前來，向主席敬獻绣「華胄之先」四字的錦旗，當由主席侍從副官代為接受，同時，主席侍從準備行李，錢市長此時亦到達，三時正，美海軍上將柯克，棒花一束，躍下汽車，親自送進主席官邸大門，但立即辭去。四時正主席由龍華機場乘「美齡」號專機飛京，出席軍事復員會議，預定昨晚招待美第七艦隊總司令柯克上將之宴會，臨時由夫人留滬主持。</p>

<h3>中外關心的東北問題</h3>
<p>日寇投降了半年，而二次世界大戰最初導火綫的中國東北問題，還是沒有完全解決。中蘇同盟友好條約簽訂了也剛滿半年，而中蘇之間關於東北問題之非正式談判還在若斷若續，蘇軍還沒有自東北撤退，國軍還停留在溝帮子而不能進入瀋陽長春。這兒究竟是自棄一回事？上海的中外記者，都關心東北問題，全國同胞都關心東北問題，全世界人士也都關心東北問題。我們不禁要問：東北現在究竟是怎樣了？</p>
<p>昨天本報接到一位讀者自溝帮子寄來的信，我們讀到下面一段話，就可對現在的東北有一個輪廓印象。他說：</p>
<p>『我到達東北，本來打算馬上回家省親，但是東北的交通也是不通，同時常有暗殺，使我不便回家，言之痛心。我目睹山海關至錦州一帶，過去日本所設的工廠及住宅，都被共軍澈底的破壞。據老百姓吿訴我，某軍把機器運去，共軍就招集窮百姓拆房子，所以國家到東北接收人員的住，眞成間題。破壞的太可惜了！東北同胞在沒有國軍的地區，飽嘗苛捐雜稅的苦，陷水愈深，陷火愈熟。所以同胞都熟望早能恢復治安。若不是我目睹破壞的慘狀，也不會相信目前同胞的痛苦竟會甚於日宼佔領時期。共軍在東北的標語，使我對於共產黨發生厭惡的印象，「擁護史太林元帥，建築中國的蘇維埃聯邦政府。」他們根本忘記了中國爲什麼有抗日戰爭！老百姓們都說：「現在還不如偽滿時代，因爲那時至少生命還有些保陣。」共軍絲毫沒有紀律，自己也不聽上邊的主張，尾大不掉。對於國家前途，我們站在民衆立場上，實在擔　。</p>
<p>據本報南京電，關終經濟部代理東北特派員張莘夫等遇害一說，業已獲得證實。聞張氏於一月十六日隨同蘇方人員，由潘陽往撫順洽商接收談區煤礦時，在途中被害，同時遭難者尙有隨員及侍衛等七人。其時撫順礦區已由蘇軍而移於共軍之掌握中。我們把這一件已由官方承認的事實，和前面所引讀者通信的報吿，互相印證，當不難窺見今天的東北已是怎麼一個世界。</p>
<p>外國記者十三日曾問到「蘇軍自中國東北九省完全退出之期」，而　主席則作很有含蓄的答復，說「蘇軍本已相約在二月一日以前退出東北」。那麼日期已過了半月，國軍早又源源開往，而何以蘇軍還延遲撤退？中蘇之間，究竟還要商談什麼經濟問題？在中國方而，誠如　主席所云，「並無不可公開吿人之事」，而我們報人就只盼望把中外關心的東北問題，政府隨時把發展的情况公佈報吿。我們相信，今後的世界眞要維持和平，只有在萬事公開，明白討論之下，纔有希望。尤其中國，初列强國之林，更有坦白公開的必要。</p>
<p>「門戶開放」政策，即各國有均等貿易機會，所傳中蘇間已成立協定，准許蘇聯在東九省取得某種經濟權利，尙無官方報吿」可見東北問題，美國人士亦至爲關切。我們推溯目前東北問題的糾擾，不無起因於雅爾遠的英美蘇秘密協定。本月十一日，爲雅爾達會議周年紀念日，華盛頓倫敦及莫斯科三地同時公佈蘇聯參加對日作戰所提三項秘密條件：（一）規定蘇聯於德國投降後三個月內參加遠東戰爭；（二）外蒙人民共和國之地位，應保持不變；（三）在「一九〇四年日本背信的攻擊」（即日俄戰爭）以前，蘇聯各項權利應予恢復；包括（甲）庫頁島南部及其毗迎各島——即指千島列島而言——歸還蘇聯，（乙）大連闢爲國際港，旅順復歸蘇聯租借，（丙）中蘇共管中東及南滿鐵道。原公表又稱：蘇聯各項主要利益，可由此項計劃獲得保障；中國對於滿洲則應保持「完全主權」。協定中承認　蔣主席必須贊同外蒙，大連，旅順及鐵路各項協定，「總統（羅斯福）受史達林元帥忠吿，將採取各項措置，以便獲得此項贊同」。我們於一年以後獲悉這些秘密條件，我們應該深深的體味到中蘇條約的意義與原委。而我們所不能釋然於懷的，就是中國到今天爲止，在中國的東北九省還沒有充分行使其應談保持的「完全生機」！</p>
<p>中國今天號稱五强之一，而我們對於自身問題，對於十五年來始終懸念的東北問題，還是在緘默中，還不能一述我們的願望，中國人實在够「大量」了！中蘇友好的新關係，築基於去年八月十四日所簽訂之中蘇條約。是項條約所規定者，凑巧與此時公佈之雅爾達會議備忘錄內所列條款暗相符合。中蘇友好條約，旣爲中蘇間雙方訂立之條約，中國及中國人民對於是項條約尊敬，極願重視。在蘇聯，今日而欲承襲帝俄時代取諸於中國的特權，復於承製帝俄在華特權之外，更要求「外蒙人民共和國」之地位，予以保持不變；這與一九一七年後蘇聯對華的申明，放棄帝俄在華的特權，雖呈着極有趣，而同時實亦極遺憾的對照；然而我們却懷着壯士斷臂的悲壯情緒，爲了希望遠東和平乃至世界和平的確保，與蘇聯畢竟訂立了新的條約，建築了友好的基礎。這種條約的尊嚴是應予尊重的。然而東北局勢，數月來却始終未臻於明朗的境域。在現階段的情勢下，容忍緘默，在政府或尙有其必要，可是在一般中國人民的心目中，究竟作何感想？究竟那方面不尊重這條約？常常自稱代表人民的各黨各派，以及社會賢達，有沒有在論政爭權之餘暇</p>
<p>在這種局勢相當嚴重而中國人還是「守口如瓶」的情况之下，我們讀到美國務卿貝爾納斯重申「門戶開放」政策的聲明而感到振奮。所謂「門戶開放」政策，原包括兩點：中國領土及主權的完整，與各國在華貿易機會的均等。這是美國對外政策兩大支柱之一，由門羅主義蛻化而成的泛美主義與在遠東的「門戶開放」。這政策的肇端，由於五十年前的東北，五十年來，「門戶開放」政策可說與東北結着深遂。日本欲破壞中國領土及主權的完整與各國在華貿易機會的均等，由瀋陽砲火不斷演進，而終至激成「珍珠港」之變與與太平洋戰爭的爆發。為了維護這國策，多少美國的男兒死在太平洋的荒島上，死在菲律賓，死在琉球。現在日寇崩潰，勝利在握，而東北的局勢依舊未臻明朗，而且在發展着的局勢，又有多與「門戶開放」政策的原則不相容的迹象。中國的東北，不僅是中國有關的問題，而是世界安危所擊的問題。不但日國田中早已認定征服滿蒙而後可以征服中國，征服中國而後可以征服世界，最近紐約時報也指出，控制東九省是控制中國的鎖　，控制中國就可以控制整個亞洲。可見東北九省如不照開罷宣言，完全交還中國，則亞洲和平乃至世界和平均將感到威脅。美國務卿於此際而有對「門戶開放」政策的重申，尤覺其中意義的深長。</p>
<p>戰後太平洋和平的維繫，關鍵就在中國和蘇美英的關係如何。中國沒有領土或政治上的野心，這已經我　蔣主席迭次昭吿中外。但我們要確保我們固有的及旣得的權益，那又自不待言。我們旣爲確保戰後和平而已作種種讓步，我們就次不能於這些讓步之外，更有繼續不斷的退讓。退讓畢竟是有限度的。「門戶開放」政策，若拋棄了確保中國主權領土的完整，便沒有了所謂「在華貿易議會的均等。」對於東北的局勢，實在有早日澄淸的必要；而在洽淸東北局勢的努力上，這似乎不完全是中蘇兩國間的事，而需要我們盟邦的共同協力。如今關於雅爾達的秘密協定是公布了，則關於東北局勢的澄淸，除中蘇兩國應直接努力外，不難見其國際關係之所在。我們願大家坦白報告東北問題的眞相，我們更盼大家開誠布公約討論東北問題，說出自己的願望。</p>

<h3>審訊日本戰犯　當庭宣讀供狀　被告承認絞斃美飛行員</h3>
<p>〔聯合社本埠訊〕美國軍事法庭昨日續審殺害漢口美飛行員各犯，宣讀日本下士三人之簽字供狀，承認曾將美飛行員三人用繩紋斃，但係奉命執行。</p>
<p>據漢勰日憲兵部准尉藤井勉供述，於一九四四年十二月十六日夜半前至火葬塲，美飛行員三人因遊行疲勞，且遭痛毆，已不能直立，乃將其放在地上，解下綁總兩手之繩子繞於頸際。其中一人由彼手執繩之一端，幫同勒斃迨證明氣息已絕，始行鬆手。尙有美飛行員兩人，亦於同時用繩勒斃，然後將屍身裝車搬運，投入火葬爐內。此次執行死刑，係奉漢口憲兵司令服部中校命令，服部於未遭逮前服毒自盡。次據白川及久松實兩人所供情形，大致與藤井相同並謂係奉長官命令行事此項供招，係在漢口取得，當時曾由日本三十四軍司令部之松浦中校帮同偵查。今日提出時，被吿辯護律師曾表示反對，謂係威脅供認，並謂美國在華已無治外法權，應蔣本案註銷，庭上未加評論，即予否次。</p>

<h3>當局嚴厲取締投機　金市交易停頓</h3>
<p>美鈔公債股票　均無正式行市</p>
<p>烚赤昨因當局對證券大樓採取斷然處置，九時前即派大批人員扼守各出入口，並有武裝人員恊助，初時禁出，繼而禁入，同時對退出人等搜查，最後則開放九江路東首出入口，對證交大樓各號房間實行抽查帳册，形勢嚴重，投機商以及散戶裹足不前，市場遂無形停頓，不公開之暗市成交，初時爲一五〇萬左右，最低曾退至一四〇萬以下，午刻一四〇萬左右，銀樓飾金初掛十六萬，繼而降爲十五萬八，後又停止掛牌，紋銀仍爲一千六·銀元七百五至八百元，暗拆仍昻，投機市場旣有風潮，擁資者不肯放出，息價自二角至二角半不等。</p>
<p>外幣美鈔以錢兌業亦攝於當局嚴重措置，並不公開賣買，隔日交易成爲懸案，尙難解次，以致迄無正式公開交易，暗盤二千元有少數成交，最後一九六〇元至二〇〇〇元，港票受紗布商印棉結款關係，老票及電報自三五〇元至三七〇元有大量納戶，新票仍喊前收價，以其投機性濃，打擊一來成交遂難。</p>
<p>公債及華洋股票以無法集會，迄無正式行市，僅因種公債自一八〇〇元退至一七〇〇元稍有對做交易。</p>
<h3>取締抽機聲中　主要物價齊跌</h3>

<p>昨日米市以金價停掛，人心轉軟，各糧均一致下挫，粳秈米中下者回小五六百元，麵粉下降三四百元，黃豆猛跌千元以上，油價亦小二三四千元不一，豆餅供過於求，續小五六百元，妋皮亦小百元，惟生仁仍居站局，</p>
<p>紗</p>
<p>昨日紗市倐降倐升，晨初人心因震於當軸禁止金鈔等投機性買賣之消息而狂落，廿支製馬一度降至八十八萬低價，藍鳳亦到八十三五萬，曇花一現，後又以買戶踵至，藍鳳復升至九十萬，雙馬再叩百萬大關，局勢因是而微挺，粗紗收市價較昨日約小四五萬，但四十二支因去化較尠，初開即降十五萬元，嗣賣氣慾濃，一度下跌至一百六十八萬元，收盤比上日竟慘落二十七萬元之鉅，</p>
<p>布</p>
<p>布市受紗價慘落影響，市價亦告回跌，各小二三千元不等，紡建公司曾開出四二碼如意漂布六萬八千元，又四〇碼藍孔雀漂布六萬二千元，又四二碼跳鯉漂布五萬五千元，又三〇碼跳鯉元色斜二萬六千五百元，又一〇三八漂布五萬八千元，又六〇三八漂布六萬四千元云，</p>
<p>花</p>
<p>昨日現棉交易較為減色，因紗市跌勢　勁，紡建公司忽存觀　，朱有採辦，祇其他舉廠稍有零星交易，價較上日爲鬆，大中集獨小四千元，</p>
<p>絲</p>
<p>昨市絲綢投機者咸有戒心，故市場寂靜，人造絲未做交易，場外一二〇天橋現貨合記新賣出二百十萬元，棧單大約喊一百二十萬元至一百二十五葛元，無準確行市，人心虛軟，類皆作壁上觀，廠經持貨者均不肯賤賣，計價與上日相仿，交易等於停頓，綢貨美亞被緞每百條晨喊一百二十萬元，降至一百十六萬元，大誡格　　做價較上日約短百分之十，民生織錦緞與林記蠟羽紗開價原盤未更，</p>

<p>自由談</p>
<p>隨筆</p>
<h3>談「寓言」</h3>
<p>— 小山</p>
<p>宇宙間本來沒有寓言，也用不着寓言，誰對誰都可以說坦白的話。</p>
<p>寓言是為適應某種環境，人物而有的。牠通用於兩種地方：迷信圈內；專制圈內。</p>
<p>希臘和印度，人民『鬼風』甚盛，一條蛇，一棵樹，一堆石頭，一隻蛤蟆，都可以成為他們的『菩薩』。他們迷信得像頑石一般，平常的談吐，是打不進耳朶裏去的，只好繞個大圈子，說說寓言，講講比方，或者可以領悟一點。所以這兩處就成了寓言的大產地。</p>
<p>古羅馬的寓言也很出名。原因是他們的幾位『暴君』特別道地，人民說一句明朗些的話語，隨時會遭受意外，不得已，只得借重寓言，用隻貓兒狗兒聊些諷刺！</p>
<p>人人長着一張嘴吧，除了喫飯，就是為着說話。如果有話欲說而不便說，而不准說，這是多苦惱的一回事？明明要說一個人，又必須『寓人於狗』，『從狗說起』，這又是多麼悶氣的一回事？</p>
<p>更難堪的，就是被寓被指的人，明明知道，『狗就是我』，却又碍於人面狗面之分，不便逕認，只好調侃一句』他說的是狗，於我無干！』或者竟然來個『亮相』：『狗就是狗罷，瞧瞧老子的顏色？』</p>
<p>一個沒有耳朶的人，憑你妙喩百出，寓言萬千，結果還是「汪汪咬兩口』！因此，寓言雖多，寓言的收成常常等於大風刮剩的葡萄。</p>
<p>我盼望寓言早日消減，直接的人不再說間接的話。我也盼望被「寓』的人君子自重，不然，縱使沒有人說你是狗，你裏面的五臟，還是會自認狗肺狗腑不諱的。</p>
<h3>珍聞　怪雨</h3>
<p>— 黃嘉歷</p>
<p>由天而降者，最普通的是雨，雪，霜，霧，雹這一類的東西。有時刮了大風，也會飛沙走石。到了這一次的世界大戰，除了飛機下彈而外，以傘兵隊的降陸為最新鮮的玩藝，眞是所謂飛將軍從天而降也。這種彈雨，人雨，雖也可稱為怪雨，但這却是人造雨，初非不能理解者。道裏所述的怪雨，是一種和水柱有關聯的魚雨及其他動物。</p>
<p>試想自天空忽然有大批活跳跳的魚，蛙和類似的動物如雨下降，道是一種極其非常之事，無怪乎有許許多多的人不肯相信有這種的事件發生。但是在一九三九年六月十七日倫敦泰晤士報却載着這一段的消息。據威爾斯，思橋市立游泳池監督報告稱，在富大下午四時半左右，曾下了一陣大雨。他急跑逃避，當他在跑的時候，他聽見背後一種聲音，料想是泥塊下落的聲音。他說：</p>
<p>『我回頭一看，大為驚奇，看見數千頭的小蛙落在游泳池四周的三合土小徑上。在幾秒鐘內就停止了，每隻小蛙與指尖大小相同。我把牠們掃集鏟在水桶內。』</p>
<p>某好奇的報館記者曾按照這段記者去作一次專訪，對曾親歷其境目擊小蛙自天而降的人進行採訪。英軍歐文中校曾在報上發表一篇文件，說當他在印度巴當利之時，在一陣大風雨之後，他騎馬經過操塲。他發現三四畝的場地完全被小魚所覆蓋着，魚的大小像白魚或小沙丁魚一橡。</p>
<p>全世界各處的報紙，不時載着許多共他類似的奇奇怪怪的事件。下面有美國報紙所載的這種怪事之一：</p>
<p>在一次暴風雨之時，羅德島，波維延司街道上，忽由天降下活躍的鱸和　，有的長約五吋。有一畝四分之一的面積遍遍都是這種漁。有一個人正在雨中，事後他說，他不但被雨的擊，也被漁所擲！許多孩子提桶子拾到了許多魚去賣，另外有一個人拾到了滿滿一大桶，排在店窗內公開陳列。</p>
<p>但是由天而降的怪雨尙不止這種魚雨和蛙雨，不過多數這種怪事都是和水中動物或兩棲動物有關的。我曾經把由天降落的動物在報上發表者記錄下來，其中有下列各種：在法國薩翁河畔的察朗城有癩蝦蟆降落；在菲洲烏干達（最近的河流距離三十英里）有白魚自天而降；英國巴司城有水母降下；在加拿大蒙推爾曾降下小壁虎；紐的市曾降下一陣蝌蚪雨；挪威曾有一次落下鼠雨；在雷盧斯曾下過蝸牛雨；在哈爾姆士達則下了紅蟲雨；在美國印地安那州克里夫通城曾下了一大陣的棕蟲雨，並有長二呎的活鰐魚。</p>
<p>大槪在英國所曾降落的一陣最怪的雨，要算一八八一年瓦塞斯達城所發生的了。在某次暴風雨之後，各街道上滿布着從天而落的玉黍螺和蟹。據稱所拾到的玉黍螺數達十大袋之多，都在市場上出賣。有一人在他的私人花園中共拾到了玉黍螺二大袋。但是瓦塞斯達城距海却有五十英里之遙呢！</p>
<p>這種怪雨的唯一解釋是：被旋風自湖海卷起的水柱，可把幾噸的海水捲起四百二十呎高，同時水中的一大隊的蛙，魚，或玉黍螺或其他動物自然也容易被捲起，被巨風送到數十哩的地方去，到了水柱解體之時，就降洛在無人能够預料的地方了。</p>
<p>逸聞</p>
<h3>鸚鵡能言</h3>
<p>— 中一</p>
<p>以前，在挪威的京城奧斯陸散布着一種流言，說某一位市民養着一隻鸚鵡，能說「打倒希特勒！」這句話。流言的傳布素來是極迅速的，傳呀傳的，最後，給納粹的「蓋世太保」們知道了這件事，便立刻警吿這隻鸚鵡的主人，說仙們預備來拜訪拜訪他！「蓋世太保」的拜訪，可能有怎樣的後果，這是不用疑問的，於是在憂懼之餘，他就去向當地的收師求助。仁慈的牧師當下便敎他一個避禍的方法，答應將自己所養的一隻鸚鵡借給他，而把他的一隻藏在牧師家裏。</p>
<p>果然，「蓋世太保」們光降了。他們責問他為甚麼敎鸚鵡說「打倒希特勒」侮辱他們的元首？很泰然地，這位挪威人答道：「我的鸚鵡次不含有政治性，請不要寃枉我」。</p>
<p>但是「蓋世太保」們可不是這樣容易打發的。其中的一個便立即走到鸚鵡旁邊呌道：「打倒希特勒！」鸚鵡却沉默着毫無反應。他再反覆地說了幾遍，而鸚鵡還是不作聲。結果，其餘兩個「蓋世太太保」也參加了他的陣綫，三位一體大聲地喊道：「打倒希特勒！」「打倒希特勒！」…</p>
<p>「亞們！」牧師的那隻鸚鵡巧妙地　道。</p>

<h3>Chairman Chiang's Special Plane Arrives in Beijing from Shanghai</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 15th] Chairman Chiang arrived in Beijing at 5:20 PM on the 15th aboard the "Meiling" special plane. Before landing, the plane circled Ming Palace Airport once. After alighting from the plane, the Chairman nodded in greeting to welcoming personnel, including Commander-in-Chief He, and also remotely returned the greeting to women representatives from various circles in the back rows of the welcoming party. Having heard in advance of the Chairman's arrival, the entire city hung flags in welcome, and cheers resounded along the route from the airport to the Chairman's official residence.</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Chairman Chiang left Shanghai yesterday (15th) at around 4 PM aboard the "Meiling" special plane to fly to Beijing to preside over the Military Rehabilitation Conference. Zhang Daofan, Yu Jishi, Chen Xizeng, Tang Zong, Zhou Hongtao, Wang Gongji, Lu Tiehan, Zhu Peiji, and Wu Wenzhi accompanied him. Upon hearing the news, our reporter hurried to Longhua Airport at 3:45 PM. The airport was already prepared. The "Meiling" special plane, facing south, was waiting fifty-odd yards from the main gate and twenty-odd yards in front of the 150-person honor guard from the Songhu Garrison Command. Mayor Qian Dajun, Deputy Garrison Commander Li Jilan, and Police Chief Xuan Tiewu were standing in front of the honor guard, waiting. Two special planes carrying attendants, model C51, numbers 270 and 270, were parked to the left and right behind the "Meiling." At 3:55 PM, a red security vehicle arrived at the airport. The Chairman, accompanied by the music of the honor guard, alighted from the second black car. The Madam alighted and stood in front of the car, not moving forward. After the Chairman alighted, he took off his dark grey felt hat and, accompanied by Mayor Qian, reviewed the honor guard. The Chairman, looking solemn, approached the "Meiling" and boarded. The Madam did not accompany him. After the Chairman boarded, all the senior officers and soldiers seeing him off stood at attention and saluted. The Chairman looked out the window from the second window twice, to the left and right. As the plane started its engines and began to ascend, the Chairman waved goodbye frequently from the window for the third time to all circles before flying to Beijing. The time was 4:05 PM.</p>

<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 15th] The opening ceremony of the Military Rehabilitation Conference was held at the Army Headquarters at 9 AM this morning. Over two hundred generals attended. Commander-in-Chief He and Deputy Chief of Staff Bai delivered instructions successively until around 12 PM. Because the written reports submitted by the generals in attendance needed to be整理 (arranged), the afternoon session was cancelled. The conference is scheduled to continue at 9 AM on the 16th, when Chairman Chiang will personally deliver instructions.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 15th] On the 16th, the second day of the Military Rehabilitation Conference, after the generals respectfully listened to Chairman's instructions, the 29 senior military organizations designated by the headquarters will report in turn, providing summaries of the current situation regarding troop reorganization, personnel equipment, the military, supply conditions, military education, training, health, local security, and pacification. With a conference schedule of three to five days, each unit's report will not exceed thirty minutes. Tomorrow, Gu Zhutong, Liu Zhi, Xue Yue, and Zhang Fakui will report first.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 15th] As of 7 PM this evening, the number of generals who have reported to attend the Military Rehabilitation Conference has reached 355.

He also expressed deep concern for the welfare of the families of fallen soldiers and the future prospects of wounded and disabled veterans. All the generals in attendance were greatly moved. Deputy Chief of Staff Bai emphasized the importance of troop education and training during his instructions. The instructions of Generals He and Bai have clearly indicated that the conference will pool collective wisdom to complete the important task of rehabilitation and troop reorganization in order to achieve the grand plan of national reconstruction and troop reduction.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 15th] The strict security and confidentiality of the Military Rehabilitation Conference is, in itself, unremarkable, but it has caused some reporters to wander and peer from Zhongshan East Gate and Zhujiang Road, more than a Chinese mile away from the venue, gazing at the towering Army Building. After that, what will you do?” Using the answers of approximately one hundred people, a small statistic was created, and the result was as follows: Approximately 30% wished to study, approximately 5% wished to become police officers, approximately 5% wished to engage in industry or mining, approximately 50% wished to return to farming, approximately 5% wished to become journalists, and approximately 5% wished to become representatives.</p>
<h3>Northeast Political Council Invites Mongolian Banner Committee Members to a Tea Party</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Beiping, 15th] The Political Committee of the Northeast Headquarters of the Generalissimo convened a tea party for Mongolian Banner members in Beiping at 3 PM on the 15th. Over five thousand Mongolian Banner members attended, unanimously expressing their absolute support for Chairman Chiang and the Central Government under the unified and complete sovereignty of the nation, hoping that the government would have a new understanding of Mongolia. The gathering dispersed happily at 5 PM.</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 15th] The "Eastern Mongolian Autonomous" organization has seven departments, three of which are headed by Han Chinese, and is an organization that combines Mongolians and Han Chinese. This organization is different from the puppet local organization in Hailar because the anti-government elements in Hailar are more deeply rooted. It is heard that relevant Mongolian Banner parties here have dispatched personnel to Wangyemiao, hoping to reverse this adverse current. According to Bai Yunti, head of the Mongolian Banner Pacification Delegation, he and relevant parties have studied the Mongolian Banner issue multiple times, and it is generally agreed that a Mongolian Local Autonomous Committee should be established in the future, under the leadership of the Central Government, to handle local Mongolian Banner issues. This organization should be one that encompasses powerful figures from all sides of the Mongolian Banner and grants the Mongolian Banner people a relatively high degree of autonomy. If this can be achieved, the Mongolian Banner issue may not be difficult to resolve. He also stated that this idea has been drafted into a concrete plan and submitted to the government for review.</p>
<p>[United Press, Chongqing, 15th] The son of Prince De, the former chairman of the Japanese puppet regime in Inner Mongolia, has now become the leader of the "Eastern Mongolian Autonomous Republic." Both father and son advocate for Mongolian independence. Prince De chose the "Japanese path" and became a Japanese puppet, while his son chose the "Soviet path," having been trained in Moscow and becoming a staunch communist. After Japan's surrender, Prince De rejoined Chongqing and is now in Beiping, but his son, after residing in the Soviet Union for many years, entered the nomadic areas of the Northeast with the Red Army.</p>

Three doctors recently flew to Jin on the same plane to treat him.

<h3>Central Executive Committee Member and Southeast Pacification Commissioner Ye Chucang Passes Away from Illness Yesterday Morning; Funeral to be Held at China Funeral Home Tomorrow</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, This City Dispatch] Ye Chucang, member of the Central Executive Committee and specially appointed Pacification Commissioner for Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Nanjing, and Shanghai, was dispatched to Shanghai on December 11 of last year. He contracted a slight cold on the plane, and felt unwell after disembarking. Mayor Qian strongly urged him to be hospitalized for treatment, but Ye, feeling that his responsibility for pacification was too important to neglect, still forced himself to complete the task of pacifying the citizens of Shanghai. He met with representatives of the citizens and attended gatherings every day from dawn to late at night, never taking a break, which further weakened his health. He was admitted to the Fourth Municipal Hospital in Hongkou for treatment on the 20th, but his condition did not improve significantly. On January 6, he was transferred to the Municipal Sanatorium on Daxi Road for treatment. After undergoing diagnosis and treatment by various medical experts in Shanghai, and after Chairman entrusted President Qi Shounan of the Central Medical College to fly to Shanghai for diagnosis, it was determined that he had a lung disease caused by a cold and accumulated fatigue. Although famous doctors carefully studied and treated him, it was difficult to see results. His appetite decreased daily, and his spirit faded.</p>
<p>Sudden Change in Condition After Chairman Chiang arrived in Shanghai, he personally visited Ye on the 13th to express his condolences. Ye, feeling inspired,勉力起坐 (with effort started to get up), and the Chairman comforted him with gentle words, saying that he would telegraph President Qi to fly to Shanghai again to preside over the treatment. Unexpectedly, his condition suddenly changed at noon on the 14th, with rapid breathing and increased pulse. The attending physicians were helpless. He passed away at 4:40 AM on the 15th. His remains were immediately transferred to the China Funeral Home on Hague Road. The coffin sealing is scheduled for 3 PM on the 17th. Although he held important positions throughout his life, he never lost his scholar's character, striving for self-improvement, upholding public service, and abiding by the law. This was known throughout the country. His sudden demise has caused deep sorrow among those who heard of it.</p>
<p>Chairman Sends Condolences After hearing the news, Chairman Chiang sent Zhang Daofan, chairman of the Central Cultural Committee, to express condolences yesterday morning, and to express his condolences to Madam Ye. Various party and government figures in the city, including Mayor Qian Dajun, Pan Gongzhan, Cheng Zhonghang, Zhao Dihua, Wu Shaoshu, Hong Lanyou, and Wu Kaixian, have formed a funeral committee at the Min Guo Daily to handle funeral matters.</p>

<p>Short Commentary</p>
<h3>Mourning Mr. Ye Chucang</h3>
<p>Amidst the cheers and celebrations of the citizens of Shanghai welcoming Chairman Chiang's arrival, the sad news of the passing of Mr. Ye Chucang, member of the Central Committee, was suddenly received. The scenery remains the same, but the joy has turned to sorrow. Expectations were high, but an elder statesman has abruptly departed. This is a major loss to the nation, and is more than just a personal emotional loss.</p>
<p>Mr. Ye began his career as an editor early in life, dedicating himself to the Party and the nation, enduring countless hardships. He possessed a deep understanding and cultivation of literature throughout his life. Therefore, he could not stop writing, and his writings were often insightful. His words could inspire the revolutionary tide and prevent the noble aspirations from falling. After leaving politics, he became even more diligent, vowing to be clean and honest, never seeking personal gain, and maintaining his spirit of hard work from beginning to end. In terms of talent, he was a treasure in the political world. In terms of qualifications, he was an advanced member of the press. We, as colleagues, have admired his brilliance and hoped to follow his example. How could we have imagined that just as the country was celebrating its recovery, he would suddenly close his eyes and no longer see? Many things are tangled together, making it difficult to bear.</p>
<p>However, the past is gone, and the dead cannot be brought back. Empty words of mourning are of no use. Those who are left behind must fulfill his wishes and carry them forward. We must offer suggestions and criticisms in accordance with public opinion, and we must conduct ourselves with integrity and uphold honesty. We, his colleagues, are not talented, but we are willing to encourage each other. May Mr. Ye's spirit watch over us.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Northeast China Issues of Concern to China and Foreign Countries</h3>
<p>Half a year has passed since the Japanese invaders surrendered, but the issue of Northeast China, the initial trigger of World War II, has not been completely resolved. It has also been just half a year since the signing of the Sino-Soviet Alliance Treaty of Friendship, but the informal negotiations between China and the Soviet Union regarding the Northeast issue are still intermittent. The Soviet army has not yet withdrawn from Northeast China, and the National Revolutionary Army (NRA) is still stationed in Goubangzi and cannot enter Shenyang and Changchun. What exactly is going on here? Foreign and Chinese journalists in Shanghai are concerned about the Northeast issue. Compatriots across the country are concerned about the Northeast issue, and people all over the world are concerned about the Northeast issue. We cannot help but ask: What is the situation in Northeast China now?</p>
<p>Yesterday, this newspaper received a letter from a reader in Goubangzi. After reading the following passage, we can get a general idea of ​​the current situation in Northeast China. He said:</p>
<p>"I arrived in Northeast China and originally planned to go home immediately to visit my relatives, but the transportation in Northeast China is also blocked, and there are frequent assassinations, which make it inconvenient for me to go home. It is heartbreaking to say. I have witnessed the factories and residences built by the Japanese in the area from Shanhaiguan to Jinzhou being completely destroyed by the Communist army. According to the common people, after a certain army transported the machines away, the Communist army gathered poor people to demolish the houses, so it is really a problem for the national government's personnel to find places to live in Northeast China. The destruction is too regrettable! Compatriots in Northeast China in areas without the National Revolutionary Army (NRA) are suffering from heavy taxes and levies, sinking deeper and deeper into the water and fire. Therefore, compatriots are eagerly hoping to restore order as soon as possible. If I hadn't witnessed the tragic destruction, I wouldn't have believed that the suffering of compatriots is even greater than during the Japanese occupation. The slogans of the Communist army in Northeast China gave me a repulsive impression of the Communist Party: 'Support Marshal Stalin and build a Soviet Federal Government of China.' They have completely forgotten why China had the War of Resistance Against Japan! The common people all said: 'Now it is not as good as the puppet Manchukuo era, because at least there was some guarantee of life at that time.' The Communist army has no discipline at all and does not listen to the orders from above. They are too big to be controlled. Standing from the perspective of the people, we are really worried about the future of the country."</p>
<p>According to a report from our newspaper in Nanjing, the report that Zhang Xinfu, the acting special envoy to the Northeast of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, and others were killed has been confirmed. It is reported that on January 16, Mr. Zhang accompanied Soviet personnel from Pan Yang to Fushun to discuss the takeover of coal mines in the area when he was murdered on the way. Seven attendants and guards also died at the same time. At that time, the Fushun mining area had been transferred from the Soviet army to the control of the Communist army. By cross-referencing this fact, which has been officially acknowledged, with the report from the reader's letter cited earlier, it is not difficult to see what kind of world Northeast China is today.</p>
<p>Foreign journalists asked on the 13th about "the date when the Soviet army will completely withdraw from the nine provinces of Northeast China," and Chairman Chiang Kai-shek gave a very subtle answer, saying that "the Soviet army had originally agreed to withdraw from Northeast China before February 1." So half a month has passed since that date, and the NRA has been continuously heading there. Why is the Soviet army delaying its withdrawal? What economic issues do China and the Soviet Union still need to discuss? On the Chinese side, as Chairman Chiang Kai-shek said, "there is nothing that cannot be disclosed to the public," and we reporters only hope that the government will announce and report the development of the Northeast issue of concern to China and foreign countries at any time. We believe that if the world truly wants to maintain peace in the future, there is hope only if everything is open and discussed clearly. Especially China, which has just entered the ranks of the great powers, has an even greater need for frankness and openness.</p>
<p>The "Open Door" policy, that is, all countries have equal trade opportunities. The report that an agreement has been reached between China and the Soviet Union to allow the Soviet Union to obtain certain economic rights in the nine provinces of Northeast China "has not been officially reported." It can be seen that American personnel are also very concerned about the Northeast issue. We trace the current troubles in Northeast China to the secret agreement between the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union in Yalta. On the 11th of this month, the anniversary of the Yalta Conference, Washington, London, and Moscow simultaneously announced the three secret conditions proposed by the Soviet Union for participating in the war against Japan: (1) The Soviet Union was to participate in the Far East war within three months after Germany's surrender; (2) The status of the Mongolian People's Republic should remain unchanged; (3) The Soviet Union's rights before "Japan's perfidious attack in 1904" (i.e., the Russo-Japanese War) should be restored, including (A) the return of the southern part of Sakhalin Island and its adjacent islands – referring to the Kuril Islands – to the Soviet Union, (B) Dalian was to be opened as an international port, and Lushun was to be returned to the Soviet Union for lease, (C) China and the Soviet Union were to jointly manage the Chinese Eastern Railway and the South Manchurian Railway. The original announcement also stated that the Soviet Union's main interests could be guaranteed by this plan; China should maintain "complete sovereignty" over Manchuria. The agreement acknowledged that Chairman Chiang Kai-shek must agree to the agreements on Outer Mongolia, Dalian, Lushun, and the railways, and "President (Roosevelt) was advised by Marshal Stalin to take various measures to obtain this agreement." We learned about these secret conditions one year later, and we should deeply appreciate the significance and origin of the Sino-Soviet Treaty. What we cannot be relieved about is that China, to this day, has not fully exercised the "complete vitality" that it should maintain in the nine provinces of Northeast China!</p>
<p>China today is known as one of the five major powers, but we are still silent about our own problems, about the Northeast issue that has been on our minds for fifteen years, and we still cannot express our wishes. The Chinese are really "generous" enough! The new friendly relationship between China and the Soviet Union is based on the Sino-Soviet Treaty signed on August 14 last year. What is stipulated in this treaty coincides with the terms listed in the memorandum of the Yalta Conference announced at this time. Since the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship is a treaty concluded between China and the Soviet Union, China and the Chinese people respect and value this treaty very much. In the Soviet Union, today it wants to inherit the privileges taken from China by the Tsarist Russian era, and in addition to inheriting the privileges of Tsarist Russia in China, it also demands that the status of the "Mongolian People's Republic" be maintained unchanged. This presents a very interesting, and at the same time, very regrettable contrast to the Soviet Union's statement after 1917 renouncing the privileges of Tsarist Russia in China. However, with the tragic mood of a hero breaking his arm, in order to ensure peace in the Far East and even world peace, we ultimately signed a new treaty with the Soviet Union and built a foundation of friendship. The dignity of this treaty should be respected. However, the situation in Northeast China has never been clear for several months. Under the current circumstances, tolerating silence may still be necessary for the government, but what do the general Chinese people think in their hearts? Which side does not respect this treaty? The various parties and factions that often claim to represent the people, as well as social figures, do they have any spare time after discussing politics and fighting for power?</p>
<p>Under this rather serious situation, where the Chinese are still "tight-lipped," we are encouraged by the statement by US Secretary of State Byrnes reaffirming the "Open Door" policy. The so-called "Open Door" policy originally included two points: the integrity of China's territory and sovereignty, and the equality of trade opportunities for all countries in China. This is one of the two pillars of American foreign policy, the Pan-Americanism that evolved from the Monroe Doctrine and the "Open Door" in the Far East. The beginning of this policy was due to Northeast China fifty years ago. For fifty years, the "Open Door" policy can be said to be deeply connected with Northeast China. Japan wanted to undermine the integrity of China's territory and sovereignty and the equality of trade opportunities for all countries in China. From the continuous artillery fire in Shenyang, it eventually evolved into the Pearl Harbor incident and the outbreak of the Pacific War. To maintain this national policy, many American men died on the barren islands of the Pacific, in the Philippines, and in the Ryukyus. Now that the Japanese invaders have collapsed and victory is in hand, the situation in Northeast China is still unclear, and there are many signs that the developing situation is incompatible with the principles of the "Open Door" policy. China's Northeast is not only an issue related to China, but an issue that affects world peace and security. Not only did Japanese Tanaka already believe that conquering Manchuria and Mongolia would lead to the conquest of China, and conquering China would lead to the conquest of the world, but the New York Times recently pointed out that controlling the nine provinces of Northeast China is the key to controlling China, and controlling China can control the entire Asia. It can be seen that if the nine provinces of Northeast China are not fully returned to China in accordance with the Open Door Declaration, peace in Asia and even world peace will be threatened. The reaffirmation of the "Open Door" policy by the US Secretary of State at this time makes its significance even more profound.</p>
<p>The key to maintaining peace in the Pacific after the war lies in the relationship between China and the Soviet Union, the United States, and Britain. China has no territorial or political ambitions, which our Chairman Chiang Kai-shek has repeatedly declared to China and foreign countries. But it goes without saying that we must ensure our inherent and acquired rights and interests. Since we have already made various concessions to ensure peace after the war, we cannot continue to make concessions beyond these concessions. Concessions are ultimately limited. If the "Open Door" policy abandons ensuring the integrity of China's sovereignty and territory, there will be no so-called "equality of trade councils in China." It is really necessary to clarify the situation in Northeast China as soon as possible; and in the effort to clarify the situation in Northeast China, it seems that this is not entirely a matter between China and the Soviet Union, but requires the joint cooperation of our allies. Now that the secret agreement on Yalta has been announced, in addition to the direct efforts of China and the Soviet Union to clarify the situation in Northeast China, it is not difficult to see the international relations involved. We are willing for everyone to frankly report the truth about the Northeast issue, and we hope that everyone will openly and publicly discuss the Northeast issue and express their own wishes.</p>

<h3>Speculative Market Receives a Head-On Blow, Authorities Inspect Securities Firms, Decisive Action Taken Against Illegal Trading, Small Money Shops Engaging in Improper Business Will Be Shut Down</h3>
<p>(Our Newspaper) In recent days, speculative market trading in the city has been in full swing, with securities and foreign currencies all rising frantically in a straight line, setting new records since the victory.</p>
<p>Implementation of Securities Firm Inspection</p>
<p>At around 8:00 AM yesterday, specially appointed personnel from the Financial and Monetary Special Commissioner's Office of the Ministry of Finance stationed in Beijing and Shanghai, together with police officers, went directly to the Huashang Securities Exchange Building on Hankou Road in this city to resolutely implement inspections of all securities firms. This was the first time since the victory that the government had intervened in the speculative market. When the inspection team arrived at the building, they immediately posted the announcement prepared by the Special Commissioner's Office at the main entrance, and sealed off the main door of the building leading to Hankou Road, leaving only the door on Jiujiang Road open for passage. The inspectors then boarded the building and inspected each securities firm one by one, reviewing the account books of each firm and extracting the facts. At the same time, they also inspected people entering and leaving the building, but did not seal off any firms or arrest anyone. The speculative trading in securities and foreign currencies was thus temporarily curbed.</p>
<p>Speculation Strictly Punished According to Law</p>
<p>The announcement from the Special Commissioner's Office is recorded as follows: "In accordance with Article 7 of the Regulations for Handling Exchanges in the Beijing-Shanghai Area: 'During the liquidation period, exchanges shall not engage in any trading activities, and shall notify their commissioned brokers and firms that they shall not engage in any customer trading activities during the exchange's suspension period. If there is a violation, in addition to the fact that the law will not protect such trading activities, the broker's qualification shall be revoked.' It is reported that brokers and securities firms in the Huashang Securities Exchange Building in this city are sometimes engaged in customer trading, speculation, and manipulation of gold, foreign exchange, and securities, which is improper. In addition to sending personnel to conduct strict investigations and impose severe punishments according to law, this announcement is hereby issued to warn them not to violate it, lest it cause inconvenience. Financial and Monetary Special Commissioner's Office of the Ministry of Finance stationed in Beijing and Shanghai, Cai Zi No. 5, Special Commissioner Chen Xing, February 15th, 35th year of the Republic of China."</p>

I was told that the authorities had been closely monitoring the waves of speculation in the market for days. The authorities resolutely implemented inspections of the brokers and their firms under the jurisdiction of the securities exchange yesterday to see if they had engaged in speculation, manipulation, and illegal trading. If the facts are verified, not only will the broker's qualification be revoked, but if the circumstances are serious, in addition to investigating the firm, the person in charge will also be handed over to the court for interrogation, so that the speculators know to be vigilant. It is also reported that the authorities are deeply indignant at the small money shops in the Sichuan Road area of this city, which do not engage in proper business and often engage in illegal speculative trading in securities and foreign currencies. The authorities have already sent a letter to the Social Affairs Bureau ordering them to be shut down, and will take decisive action if necessary.</p>

<h3>Newspaper Workers' Benefits Not Resolved</h3>
<p>Shanghai newspaper workers have requested that the management improve their benefits. The workers' union submitted a written proposal to the management of various newspapers on the afternoon of the 13th: "Starting from February, the salaries and allowances of workers will be calculated based on the rise and fall of the 'workers' cost of living index' published by the authorities. The base number will be the average of 55 yuan per worker in the 20th year (1931)." They were given a deadline of this afternoon to reply. According to sources from the union, the union has received replies from various newspapers, either in writing or verbally, but they are all vague and difficult to satisfy the workers. The workers' emotions are very tense, and they are preparing to apply to the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau for mediation in accordance with the law.</p>
<h3>Record of Electricity Mediation: Both Parties Sign</h3>
<p>The mediation record for the labor dispute at the city's electricity company was signed by both parties yesterday.</p>

(6) Cotton and wool textile workers in the Third and Fourth Districts of the city submitted demands to the employers for salary adjustments based on the cost of living index, which have not yielded results. This afternoon at 1:00 PM, Mr. Shu Yunzhang, Manager of the China Textile Company, will personally attend negotiations.</p>
<h3>Trial of Japanese War Criminals: Confessions Read in Court; Defendant Admits to Strangling American Pilot</h3>
<p>[United Press Local Dispatch] The American Military Tribunal yesterday continued the trial of those who murdered American pilots in Hankou. Signed confessions from three Japanese corporals were read, admitting to strangling three American pilots with ropes under orders.</p>
<p>According to the confession of Warrant Officer Fujii Tsutomu of the Hankou Japanese Military Police, before midnight on December 16, 1944, he went to the crematorium. The three American pilots were fatigued from marching and severely beaten, unable to stand. They were placed on the ground, and the ropes binding their hands were untied and wrapped around their necks. Fujii held one end of the rope for one of the pilots, helping to strangle him until his breath ceased, then released the rope. The other two American pilots were also strangled at the same time. The bodies were then loaded onto a vehicle and put into the crematorium furnace. This execution was carried out under the orders of Lieutenant Colonel Hattori, Commander of the Hankou Military Police, who committed suicide by poison before being arrested. The confessions of Shirakawa and Hisamatsu Minoru were largely the same as Fujii's, stating they acted under orders from superiors. These confessions were obtained in Hankou, with the assistance of Lieutenant Colonel Matsuura of the 34th Army Headquarters of Japan. When presented today, the defendant's defense lawyer objected, claiming the confessions were coerced and arguing that the United States no longer had extraterritorial rights in China, requesting the case be dismissed. The court did not comment but denied the request.</p>
<p>Sentencing Next Week: Over half of the war criminals' confessions have been read, and the rest may be completed today, to be reviewed by the presiding judge and jurors. Next Monday, the defendant's defense lawyer, Harkins, will read his rebuttal evidence, followed by formal arguments and sentencing.</p>
<h3>Various Groups Forming Committee to Protect People's Freedom</h3>
<p>Since the Political Consultative Conference advocated for the protection of people's freedom and stipulated in the second provision of the Peace and National Construction Report that "local councils, bar associations, and representatives of people's organizations shall jointly organize a people's freedom protection committee," it has been learned that representatives from the city's bar association, chamber of commerce, local association, education association, farmers' association, student federation, accountants' association, and other people's organizations, as well as Shanghai-based senators, have jointly initiated preparations and are actively planning to establish the Shanghai People's Freedom Protection Committee.</p>
<h3>High Court Hears Two Treason Cases</h3>
<p>[Reported by This Newspaper] Yesterday morning, the Criminal Division of the High Court, presided over by Judge Cao Jun, handled the case of traitors Bin Li'er and Han Jian. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Zhang Zhishan: Zhang Zhishan, former Chief of the Xujiahui Branch of the Overseas Police Bureau, and Patrolman Ma Junqing, abused their power to seize the residence of traditional Chinese medicine practitioner Chen Fengming, evicting Chen and his co-tenants. Chen recently filed a complaint, but the defendants have not been apprehended. Only the complainant appeared in court yesterday to testify. The court ordered a postponement for further hearing.</p>
<p>Gu Guoxiong: Gu Guoxiong, a secret agent for the enemy's Shanghai Southern Military Police in Penglai Road, collaborated with the enemy military police to arrest Yang Jiaji, the director of the Pudong branch of the Three Principles of the People Youth League, during the war. Yang Jiaji and his brother Yang Weier reported Gu to the authorities, leading to his arrest. The High Procuratorate investigated and confirmed the facts, prosecuting him for treason. However, the defendant claimed in court yesterday that he was a menial worker in the enemy military police, not a secret agent. Regarding the arrest of Yang Jiaji, he claimed that the translator was absent that day, so he was ordered to accompany them, and he had also provided information to underground workers. Witness Dun Zhizhang testified that he was a primary school teacher who worked for the city party headquarters during the war, engaging in underground work. He had a teacher-student relationship with the defendant, from whom he obtained information. The defendant had notified him several times that the enemy military police would arrest principals of municipal schools, etc. He reported the information to the party headquarters, but he did not know if the information was accurate. As the complainant was absent, the court ordered the case to be detained for further examination.</p>

<h3>Authorities Strictly Cracking Down on Speculation: Gold Market Trading Halts</h3>
<p>US Dollars, Government Bonds, and Stocks All Lack Formal Market Prices</p>
<p>Yesterday, due to the authorities taking decisive action against the Stock Exchange Building, a large number of personnel were dispatched to guard all entrances and exits before 9:00 AM, assisted by armed personnel. Initially, exits were prohibited, then entrances. Simultaneously, those exiting were searched. Finally, the eastern entrance of Jiujiang Road was opened, and the account books of each room in the Stock Exchange Building were randomly inspected. The situation was serious, and speculators and retail investors were deterred, causing the market to effectively halt. Unofficial black market transactions were initially around 1.5 million, dropping to below 1.4 million at the lowest point, and around 1.4 million at noon. Gold shops initially quoted 160,000, then lowered it to 158,000, before suspending quotations altogether. Silver ingots remained at 1,600, silver dollars at 750 to 800 yuan. Black market interest rates remained high, as speculators were unwilling to release funds, with interest rates ranging from 20% to 25%.</p>
<p>Foreign Exchange: Money changers dealing in US dollars were also intimidated by the authorities' serious measures and did not publicly trade. The previous day's transactions became a suspended issue, difficult to resolve, resulting in no formal public trading. In the black market, a small number of transactions occurred at 2,000 yuan, eventually settling at 1,960 to 2,000 yuan. Hong Kong dollars, due to the yarn and cloth merchants settling payments, saw a large number of old banknotes and telegrams exchanged at 350 to 370 yuan. New banknotes continued to quote previous purchase prices. Due to their highly speculative nature, trading became difficult after the crackdown.</p>
<p>Government Bonds and Chinese and foreign stocks were unable to convene, resulting in no formal market prices. Only Second-Class bonds declined from 1,800 yuan to 1,700 yuan, with a slight amount of matched trades.</p>
<h3>Major Commodity Prices Fall Amid Crackdown on Speculation</h3>
<p>Rice</p>
<p>Yesterday, the rice market saw a softening of sentiment as gold prices were suspended. All grains declined in unison, with medium to low-quality Japonica and Indica rice falling by 500 to 600 yuan. Flour decreased by 300 to 400 yuan. Soybeans plummeted by over 1,000 yuan. Oil prices also decreased by varying amounts of 2,000 to 4,000 yuan. Soybean cakes were oversupplied, continuing to decrease by 500 to 600 yuan. Bran also fell by 100 yuan. Only raw peanuts remained stable.</p>
<p>Yarn</p>
<p>Yesterday, the yarn market fluctuated sharply. In the early morning, sentiment collapsed due to news of the authorities' ban on speculative trading in gold, US dollars, etc. 20-count Double Horse yarn once fell to a low of 880,000, and Blue Phoenix reached 835,000. However, this was fleeting, as buyers rushed in, and Blue Phoenix rebounded to 900,000, while Double Horse again approached the one million mark. The situation was slightly firmer as a result. The closing price for coarse yarn was approximately 40,000 to 50,000 lower than yesterday. However, 42-count yarn declined more significantly due to slower sales. Opening lower by 150,000 yuan, selling pressure intensified, and it once fell to 1.68 million yuan. The closing price was a massive 270,000 yuan lower than the previous day.</p>
<p>Cloth</p>
<p>The cloth market was affected by the sharp decline in yarn prices, and market prices also declined, by varying amounts of 2,000 to 3,000 yuan. The Textile Construction Company offered 42-yard Ruyi bleached cloth at 68,000 yuan, 40-yard Blue Peacock bleached cloth at 62,000 yuan, 42-yard Jumping Carp bleached cloth at 55,000 yuan, 30-yard Jumping Carp natural-color twill at 26,500 yuan, 1038 bleached cloth at 58,000 yuan, and 6038 bleached cloth at 64,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Cotton</p>
<p>Yesterday, trading in spot cotton was less active. Due to the strong downward trend in the yarn market, the Textile Construction Company suddenly adopted a wait-and-see attitude, with only other factories engaging in scattered trading. Prices were lower than the previous day, with Da Zhongji declining by 4,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Silk</p>
<p>Yesterday, speculators in the silk market were cautious, resulting in a quiet market. No transactions occurred in rayon. Off-market, 120 Tiao Qiao spot goods from Heji were sold for 2.1 million yuan. Warehouse receipts were quoted around 1.2 million to 1.25 million yuan, with no accurate market prices. Sentiment was weak, and most market participants remained on the sidelines. Factory owners with inventory were unwilling to sell cheaply, with prices similar to the previous day, and trading was virtually halted. In silk fabrics, Meiya satin was quoted at 1.2 million yuan per hundred strips in the morning, falling to 1.16 million yuan. The price cut [illegible characters] was approximately 10% lower than the previous day. Minsheng brocade and Linji wax-feathered gauze maintained their original asking prices.</p>

<h3>On "Fables"</h3>
<p>— Xiaoshan</p>
<p>The universe originally had no fables, nor did it need them. Everyone could speak honestly to everyone else.</p>
<p>Fables exist to adapt to certain environments and characters. They are commonly used in two places: within superstitious circles and within autocratic circles.</p>
<p>In Greece and India, people were intensely devoted to "ghosts." A snake, a tree, a pile of stones, a toad—any of these could become their "Buddha." Their superstition was as stubborn as stone, and ordinary speech couldn't penetrate their ears. One had to go around in a big circle, telling fables and making comparisons, in the hope that they might understand a little. Thus, these two places became major producers of fables.</p>
<p>Ancient Roman fables were also famous. This was because their "tyrants" were particularly authentic. People faced unexpected consequences for saying anything too clear. They had no choice but to rely on fables, using cats and dogs to make satirical remarks!</p>
<p>Everyone has a mouth, not just for eating but also for speaking. What a torment it is if you want to say something but can't, or aren't allowed to! To clearly speak of a person, yet having to "embody the person in a dog," to "start from the dog"—how suffocating is that?</p>
<p>Even more unbearable is when the person being represented, being referred to, clearly knows that "the dog is me," yet is hindered by the distinction between human face and dog face, unable to directly acknowledge it, and can only quip, "He's talking about a dog; it has nothing to do with me!" Or, even more outrageously, to "reveal oneself": "A dog is just a dog; what do you think of my colors?"</p>
<p>For someone without ears, no matter how exquisite your metaphors or abundant your fables, the result is still "a couple of 'woof woof' bites!" Therefore, despite the abundance of fables, their harvest often equals grapes leftover after a great wind.</p>
<p>I hope fables will diminish soon, and direct people will no longer speak indirectly. I also hope those who are "embodied" will conduct themselves with self-respect. Otherwise, even if no one calls you a dog, your insides will still frankly admit to having a dog's heart and dog's guts.</p>
<h3>Rare News: Strange Rain</h3>
<p>— Huang Jiali</p>
<p>What comes down from the sky most commonly are rain, snow, frost, mist, and hail. Sometimes, during strong winds, sand and stones will fly. In this World War, besides bombs from airplanes, the landing of paratroopers is the newest spectacle—truly, "flying generals descending from the sky." This kind of rain of bombs and people can also be called strange rain, but it is man-made and not inherently incomprehensible. The strange rain described here involves water columns and fish rain, as well as other animals.</p>
<p>Imagine suddenly having a large number of lively fish, frogs, and similar animals falling from the sky like rain—it is an extremely extraordinary event. No wonder many people refuse to believe such events occur. However, on June 17, 1939, The Times of London carried this news. According to the supervisor of the municipal swimming pool in Swansea, Wales, around 4:30 PM on that day, there was a heavy rain shower. He hurried to escape, and as he ran, he heard a sound behind him, presuming it was the sound of clumps of mud falling. He said:</p>
<p>"I turned around and was greatly astonished to see thousands of small frogs falling on the concrete path around the swimming pool. It stopped in a matter of seconds, each small frog being about the size of a fingertip. I swept them up and shoveled them into buckets."</p>
<p>A curious newspaper reporter followed up on this report with a special interview, interviewing people who had witnessed the small frogs falling from the sky firsthand. British Army Lieutenant Colonel Owen published a document in the newspaper stating that when he was in Batangri, India, after a strong wind and rain, he rode his horse across the parade ground. He found that three or four acres of the ground were completely covered with small fish, the size of whitebait or small sardines.</p>
<p>Newspapers around the world frequently carry many other similar strange events. Below is one such strange event reported in an American newspaper:</p>
<p>During a storm in Providence, Rhode Island, active bass and [illegible character] suddenly fell from the sky onto the streets, some as long as five inches. One-quarter of an acre was covered with these fish. One man who was in the rain at the time said that he was not only hit by the rain but also by the fish! Many children picked up many fish in buckets to sell, while another person picked up a full bucket and displayed it openly in a shop window.</p>
<p>But the strange rain that falls from the sky is not limited to fish rain and frog rain. Most of these strange events involve aquatic or amphibious animals. I have recorded the animals that have fallen from the sky as reported in newspapers, including the following: Toads falling in Charentay, on the Saône River in France; whitefish falling from the sky in Uganda, Africa (the nearest river being thirty miles away); jellyfish falling in Bath, England; small geckos falling in Montreal, Canada; a shower of tadpoles falling in New York City; a shower of mice falling in Norway; a snail rain in Lerums; a red worm rain in Halmstad; and a large shower of brown worms falling in Clifton, Indiana, USA, along with a two-foot-long live alligator.</p>
<p>Perhaps the strangest rain that has fallen in Britain was the one that occurred in Worcester in 1881. After a storm, the streets were covered with periwinkles and crabs that had fallen from the sky. It was said that as many as ten sacks of periwinkles were collected and sold in the market. One man collected two large sacks of periwinkles in his private garden. But Worcester is fifty miles from the sea!</p>
<p>The only explanation for this strange rain is that water columns picked up by tornadoes from lakes and seas can lift several tons of seawater four hundred and twenty feet high. At the same time, a large group of frogs, fish, periwinkles, or other animals in the water are naturally also easily picked up and carried by the strong winds to places tens of miles away. When the water column breaks down, they fall in places that no one can predict.</p>
<p>Anecdotes</p>
<h3>Parrots Can Talk</h3>
<p>— Zhongyi</p>
<p>Previously, a rumor was circulating in Oslo, the capital of Norway, that a certain citizen was raising a parrot that could say "Down with Hitler!" Rumors always spread extremely quickly. As the rumor spread, it eventually reached the ears of the Nazi "Gestapo," who immediately warned the parrot's owner that they were preparing to pay him a visit! The possible consequences of a visit from the "Gestapo" were beyond doubt. In a state of worry and fear, he sought help from the local pastor. The kind pastor immediately taught him a way to avoid disaster, promising to lend him his own parrot while hiding the man's parrot in the pastor's home.</p>
<p>Sure enough, the "Gestapo" arrived. They questioned him about why he taught the parrot to say "Down with Hitler," insulting their leader. Calmly, the Norwegian replied, "My parrot's cries contain no political meaning. Please do not wrongly accuse me."</p>
<p>But the "Gestapo" were not so easily dismissed. One of them immediately walked over to the parrot and shouted, "Down with Hitler!" The parrot remained silent and unresponsive. He repeated it several times, but the parrot still did not make a sound. As a result, the other two "Gestapo" members joined his ranks. The three of them, united, loudly shouted, "Down with Hitler!" "Down with Hitler!"...</p>
<p>"Amen!" The pastor's parrot cleverly responded.</p>
