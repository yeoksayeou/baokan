<p>〔本報南京廿六日電〕蔣主席於廿六日下午二時十分，自　縣乘美齡號專機返京。登機後，因機件須臨時檢査，稽延的廿分鐘始起飛。南京天氣因受颱風侵襲，風雨竟日，下午雨勢甚大，但迎候主席之人士，均於五時前趕至明故宮機塲，塲外汽車排列整齊，主席侍從衛隊，亦先到塲佈置。美齡號機着陸前一刻鐘，雨勢漸小，六時十分，美齡號掠低空下降，旋即着陸，十八分，機聲休止。在機旁歡迎者有陳參謀總長誠，周總司令至柔，湯代總司令恩伯，桂兼代總司令永淸，張司令鎭，唐署長縱，陳主任希曾，及主席公子蔣緯國等，排列一行。機門啓處，蔣經國公子前行，兪局長濟時次之，主席繼即下機。主席精神至佳，身着藏靑長袍，外披黑色大氅，脚穿黑色軟皮鞋，與歡迎者含笑點首，陳總長一行肅立致敬，主席頻稱「好」。首由陳總長稱：今日南京天氣不好，主席答：「好，很好」。行至汽車前，復見迎接之記者羣，主席特注視，並停留一分鐘，向記者微笑云：「謝謝你們」！旋登零零零三八號汽車，蔣經國偕同出機塲。主席在炎暑中離京，於秋雨中歸來，健吒如昔，離京日期計兩個月又十二日。（七月十四日離京，駐節　山六十九日，赴贛巡視五日。）</p>
<p>〔中央社贛縣廿六日電〕蔣主席今日在民衆熱烈歡送中，專機離此飛京。上午十時。主席親臨專員公署視察，蒞縣府時有各界首長紳耆百餘人代表全體民衆敬　「萬壽無疆」錦旗，主席欣然接受，並即席訓話，闡明贛州在文化與地形上之重要，過去建設已且基礎，望人民與地力政府繼續努力，從事建築江西。主席旋至縣黨部巡視，即　車出城，自縣府至貢江邊，長達四里，民眾夾道歡送，沿途爆竹之聲不絕，主席汽車緩行，老幼爭次欲一瞻主席丰采。主席登舟後，民衆猶竚集江邊，目送歡呼不已，主席頻頻舉手答謝民衆愛戴之熱忱。旣渡，主席偕愈濟時·蔣經國·王陵基諸氏，曾小憩於通天岩，並登臨覽勝，即共進午餐，下午二時至乎機場二時十分乘美齡號專機起飛赴京。</p>
<p>〔中央社南昌二十六日電〕今日下午三時，有兩機南來，其中主席座機美齡號逕行北飛，贛主席王陵基乘另機返抵此間。</p>

<p>〔中央社南昌廿六日電〕蔣主席廿六日上午九時偕王陵　及蔣經國前往大庚（南安）靑龍鄉之賢女埠，憑弔王陽明先生逝世之地。賢女埠在章江之濱，陽明先生於明嘉靖七年，由粤來贛，至此病逝舟中，距今凡四百一十八年。主席幼年讀陽明傳習錄，深佩其良知之說，故於來贛之次日，特往馮弔，藉申誠敬。下午三時，主席車越小梅關至大梅　，大梅關當贛粤交界處，在大庾嶺之　，形勢險要，主席自粤境拾級而上，至關入贛，與居民談話，得知當敵寇侵陷大梅　時，所至砍伐梅樹，主席因嘱大庚縣政府多植新梅，保存梅林，　使損毀，嗣即離大　　返　　　會巡視大庾南康兩縣府，民衆聞主席蒞臨，鳴爆竹歡呼，情况熱烈。</p>

<p>〔本報南京廿六日電〕和平商談今日表而仍在停頓狀態中，馬特使與司徒大使仍以殷切之心情，期望共產黨轉變所堅持之意見，盼周恩來早日旋京，共策進行。上午馬特使與司徒大使兩度晤見，想係日來與共產黨之接談加以檢討。下午三時司徒大使再的王炳南前往晤談，探聽兩日來沉默中共產黨態度，首由馬氏接見，繼與司使晤面，至四時畢。據聞馬特使與司徒大使今日曾聯名致共產黨函一件，已由司徒大使面交王炳南，囑轉周恩來，衆信此項文件乃司馬兩氏對商談作進一步調解之意見，七時司徒大使赴蘇聯大使彼得羅夫晚宴，據聞馬特使將於廿八日往訪蔣主席。</p>
<p>〔路透社南京廿六日電〕數星期來逐漸惡化之政局，蔣主席返京後，或可有若十　機。馬帥已吿共方渠對復開軍事三人小組會要求之前後答復，俟與主席交換意見後，當可提出。一般皆信，政府今當提出妥協之行動，此等妥協，無論在軍事上或土地方面，均不致使政府有何損失，國軍在華北勝利，可以增强政府在談判中之力量不少，共黨目動係採觀　政策，彼等認爲下一行動，應由政府方面發動。若干外國人士且料，國軍在軍事上獲得勝利以後，政府或當繼之作若干政治上之讓步，以表現其妥協之精神。政府對於共黨之堅持原來要求、已因國大召　之　日益接近。而（　覺關心，政府　望共黨，民主同盟及其他　派與無黨派之代表，能共同參加國民大會，制定憲法，共黨目前尙無參加之意，巾共發言人王炳南聲言，共黨對於政府之邀請共方提出國大代表名單，則將予以正式之答覆，共黨堅決表示，在內戰槍聲未停以前，決不出席國民大會，一說政府在提出可爲共黨接受作爲談判基礎之條件以前，當先佔領張家口與哈爾濱兩大最後目標，以給予共產一個敎訓，此說如果歷實乎，則政府方面之軍事活動，日內當必加緊。</p>

<p>〔本報倫敦特派員廿五日電〕華北國軍節節勝利，在渦去數日問，已漸引起英國報界之注意。倫敦泰晤士報今日以「中國之和平動態」爲題著論稱，共產黨一再敗績，理　備接受政府基於憲政改革之和平建議。新希望之來臨，非完全由於美國馮人之努力所致，而至少一部分爲最近軍事發展之結果。該報指出，政府軍事勝利所產生之政治上效果有二：第一，共產黨漸知在中國境內建立對抗政府之獨立區域希望極爲渺茫，第二，政府旣經佔有日本交還共軍退出之主要區域，現擬將本年二月間成立之協定付諸實施。該報稱：實施此項協定之二大　碍，爲共黨求佔領在成立協定　不在共黨　下之區域，以及共軍企圖蓆破壞交通，以排斥政府軍隊。今則政府於奮力作戰以後，業已恢復蔣主席所認爲解決國共爭議所必要之地位。鐵路通之維持正常狀態，爲整個建設工作之必要條件，共產黨之破壞政策，爲政府所深惡痛絕。今則政府旣已發揮其權力，自可與共黨握手言和，使共黨循憲政途徑，以達成其目的，此項希望已非空虛矣」。關於國共戰事之消息，英國報紙上僅有片斷記載，中國實際情形究竟如何，英國民衆並不瞭然。本日泰晤士社論，將中國局勢加以簡括叙述，立論公正不偏，而具建設性，必能使英國民衆更能明瞭中國現狀，毫無疑義也。</p>

<p>〔本報徐州廿六日電〕共黨在政治上現遭毀滅性之失敗，其一向誇耀之政治工作，於國軍推進之際，已拆穿眞相，各地民衆，歡迎國軍，出乎眞情流露，國軍對爲共軍服務之人員，採取寬大政策，不予報復，故共軍之地方團隊，於共軍敗退時，均不願跟隨，紛紛自新，蕭縣一地達三千餘人，總數極爲可觀。共軍「鄉不離鄕，縣不離縣」之宣傳，已無能爲力，蘇省民政廳長王公璵，在此督導行政人員，配合車事，今日對記者談，共黨政治上弱點之暴露，令吾人一喜一懼，喜則人民已不受愚騙，懼則如何使收復區民衆熱情保持長久，實須下最大之努力。王氏表示：現最感因難者，厥爲特殊經費之無着，新收復區　傷滿目，在在需款，已請中央撥發專款中。又對自新共軍之處置，將加以適當之訓練。王氏復稱：北方民性强硬，民間武力甚厚，足以與共軍周旋，對國軍頗有助力。</p>

<p>〔本報瀋陽廿五日電〕關於調節東北商貨出入問題，目前極爲各方所重視。昨據東北行轅經委會商務處王副處長念祖談稱：關於商貨出入之限制與將勵問題，前會頒佈商貨出入調節暫行辦法，不過其後略有變更，主要關於猪　。馬尾等輸出品，曾採取許可辦理輸出之辦法，以後鑑於該項物資在東北地方無採取許可制度之必要，現已解除，隨意輸出，不加限制，至關於棉花。籽棉曾採用許可制度，准其輸出，月來關內價格高於東北，曾有源源流出之現象發生，復鑒於東北現况，棉花棉布異常缺乏，非但民需感覺不足，即各行將開工之紡織工廠之棉花原料供給，亦成問題，故亦改變規定，一律絕對限制出境，再關於輸出獎勵辦法，除對於輸出物品一律免稅外，其具體實施者，前有中央信託局已與英國訂定東北出口大豆一萬噸販賣合同，現該局已將該項大豆購買竣事，近期內或可經葫蘆島，上海而運往革國。此外，並預定向美國輸出大豆，現正接洽中。其次，關於出口港問題，現出口貨須經葫蘆島而至上海始可出口，但因葫蘆島港口目下條件不够，倉庫設備不敷應用，政府近擬將該港改爲直接輸出港口，不需經過上海，故須增建倉庫，想將來對於出口促進，定能裨益不少。爲謀國內各地物資有無相通，藉以平定物價而安民生起見，擬以東北生產之雜糧，與上海天津生產之麵粉。棉布，以物易物辦法，溝通有無，亦爲最近重要施策之一。又目下東北各工廠，尙未正式復工，生產品過少，民需股切，故尙無因外貨充斥影響工業發展之現象發生，暫時無此隱慮，一俟有上述情形發生之預兆時，即可按工商匯款限制辦法，予以限制。所謂工商匯款辦法者，即按現在出入口商人欲想訂購外貨，向國外匯款，須經四聯總處之審核許可後，始可匯款，如政府方面認爲某種貨之源源入口，而致影響東北某稱工業之發展時，而對於購買某項外貨之工商匯款予以限制，上述現象自可免除。</p>

<h3 id="c36">社論　坐視物價高漲者是誰？ <a href="#c36" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e36" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">36</a></h3>
<p>大凡通貨膨脹的時候，物價必然會高漲；物價高漲的時候，又往往會刺戟工商業，乘機勃興，可得到一時繁榮的現象。所以高物價政策的本身，可說是利害參半，只須用得其當，用</p>
<p>適其時，　未嘗是一個辦法，</p>
<p>不過這個例子應用到我國來，似乎又走了樣。目前不是鬧着高物價嗎？其結果却是：</p>
<p>（一）許多工廠減工關門，上海市乃至全國的全部工業，顯露着總崩潰的危險；</p>
<p>（二）失業增加，社會惶惶不安，</p>
<p>（三）出口呆滯，外貨却依然暢銷，走私之風大盛，關員警吏，幾於束手無策，或甚至說不定也在混水摸魚；</p>
<p>（四）一般人皆感覺生活困難，要求加資加薪，提高待遇，間接又促進了通貨的膨脹，和物價的高漲；</p>
<p>（五）游資過剩，造成了種種投機和不正常的買賣。</p>
<p>（六）正當工商業，不勝高利貸的壓迫，都在裝門面之下苟延殘喘。</p>
<p>照此說來，似乎今日的高物價，祇見其害，未見其利。無論從國計着想，或從民生着想，都有迅速地加以抑平的必要。上海市參議會休會前最後一次的會議，就全塲一致通過臨時緊急動議，要求政府主管機關迅速遏止物價的上漲。這確是民衆迫切的呼聲！</p>
<p>但是不幸得很，　在面前的事實，又恰恰適得其反。儘管異口同聲高呼着抑平物價，穩定物價，而物價的漲風却反而變本加厲，益發猖獗。這幾日來，竟瘋狂得不像樣了！中秋節後，上海市的一般物價，至少漲上二成，通常漲上三四成，甚至有漲上一兩倍的。這種現象，無疑地，增加了出口貨的困難，擴充了進口貨的銷路，助長了走私的氣燄，和加深了一般生活的壓迫。以前調整外匯時的一些兒希望，現在都變成了幻想！在這個時候，如果依舊因循敷衍，不採取澈底和有效的措置，恐怕社會秩序和國民經濟，難免要受到嚴重的打繫。這決非危　　聽，而顯然是即將到來的事實。</p>
<p>或者說，抑平物價，是人同此心，心同此理的。其難題在沒有適當的辦法。這話，似乎很對，其實也並不盡然。無論那一個辦法，要求它發生充分的效力，總須先有大刀闊斧的決心推行得澈底，萬不可夾雜着其他的作用或計算在內。舉一個例子米說：外匯調整以來，一般物價都上漲了，惟有黃金價格，直到最近爲止，與從前還是差不多。這原因很簡單，就在拋售的數量相當多和拋售的價格並不　目地步漲。</p>
<p>假如一面侈言抑平，一面却和黑市賽跑，而且只許漲不許跌：一經提漲，老不回頭，這種辦法，在抑平物價這一點上，會不會發生效力，明跟人自然淸楚。</p>
<p>又如，拋售的物資，數量太少，實際遠不够需要。雖說產量有限，未能照單全收，但配售結果，有時竟有餘額，滾入下期。這種支配，顯然使需要的人心存戒懼，遇貨即扒，並使一般囤商看準瞄頭，投機居奇。這辦法，在抑平物價這一點上，是否發生反刺激的作用，明眼人更會辨別。</p>
<p>儘管說，取締奸商，取締囤積，取締投機，但始終拿不出具體的取締辦法來。有了具體的辦法，又始終不肯認眞執行，予他們一個切實的打擊。不看見紗·布·糖這一類物資，日日在黑市上滿街飛嗎？這種辦法，在抑平物價這一點上，有什麽效用，更不値得一提了。</p>
<p>又有許多類似統制的機構。他們自己，旣沒有充分的物資，可以儘量供給，却又不許或限制商民自由採運，相互競銷。他們只把握了有限的物資，實行自私的壟斷，公然與商販爭利。因此物價愈高，他們的利潤也愈厚了，目前的煤炭，即是最顯著的一例。但是這種辦法，在抑平物價這一點上，　非背道而馳？</p>
<p>物價高漲的原因很多，有一部份至少是由於人事之不臧，很應該切實整頓和改善，直接减輕其成本，即問接减低其售價。例如：貨運偸竊的損失，駁卸費的不合理，高利貸的壓迫，和過於繁重的捐稅等等，皆屬耳熟能詳之事。這種負担。不爲設法分別减免，從然空　抑平物價，這種辦法，在抑平物價這一點上，會不會有良好的結果？更不待煩言而明。</p>
<p>總而言之，抑平物價，並不是沒有辦法，患在有法而不肯辦。也並非有法不辦，應在辦得太不澈底。倘使別有計算，不肯犧牲，或者還要在高物價巾撈些油水，侈陳成績，只是不痛不癢地零星敷衍，聊資點綴，那麽，無異抱薪救火，至多只好拿來安慰自已罷了！</p>
<p>所以，今天坐視物價高漲而束手無策的人們，對於國家利人民，應該自知有其責任的。</p>
<h3 id="c37">宣傳攻勢的不足恃 <a href="#c37" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e37" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">37</a></h3>
<p>自國共商談陷於停頓狀態之後，各地戰亂日益擴大，中共就發動一切宣傳攻勢，使人頭昏腦脹，其作用在要大家相信中國局勢已沒有挽救的希望。中宣部彭部長前天在京招待外籍記者時，就有某一外國新問記者詢問，「中國大局是否已無希望？」這就是因爲不明中國國悄的外人，中了共黨宣傳攻勢的毒，纔有此間。</p>
<p>中共在日本投降之後，就犯了一個致命的錯誤，它以當時佔據了有利的軍事形勢，故迷信武力爲萬能，即稱兵作亂。在今日，回想起當時巾共的姿態，何等的威風！政府雖委曲求全，企求和平，但是和戰的關鍵，完全操在中共的手裏，今天簽訂協定，明天就把它破壞無餘。而中央與友邦派來的調人，依然尊重中共的意見和主張，殊不料一味姑息，無異於縱容中共的荒謬行動，使中共的氣燄更加飛揚。中共在軍事有利的時候，便弄兵作亂，爭城奪地，一旦有所不利，便高唱無條件停戰，企圖利用停戰的時間，獲得喘息的機會，俾能秣馬厲兵，再度發動攻勢。所以現在中共要求召開三人小糾委員會，又要求　府保證下停戰令等等，幾乎沒有人再敢相信這是獲致和平的　徑。中共的宣傳攻勢，已經騙不了人。</p>
<p>煨近三個月來軍事的發展，雖已粉碎了中共依賴武力解決的迷夢，但是中共依然徘徊歧路，絕無大澈大悟的跡象。綏遠、主席傳作　將軍致電中共領袖毛澤東，雖苦勸中共放下武器，參加政府，促進憲政，而巾共的反饗如何，至今音信杳然。我們認爲中共旣還沒有到山窮水盡的地步，決不肯放下屠刀的。</p>
<p>政府決定十一月十二日如期召開國民大會，將於十月二日下令召集，選舉事務所並已發出通知各黨派，於十月十日以前提出代表名單。中共如能放棄武力解決的迷夢，而改換政治解決的途徑，則此時正是一個絕妙的機會。但據中共發言人廖承志表示：「中共對國大問題，有其一貫立塲，政府旣不停戰，又不按照政協決議行事，吾人當有保留自由行動之權，決不受此種國大的的束。一同時巾共另一發言人王炳南，則以由共召開「解放區」人民代表大會來威脅政府。這足以證明巾共並不要眞正的民主，僅欲用這個美麗的名　來欺騙民衆，分割中國罷了。</p>
<p>中共事實上雖可成爲中國第二大黨，中宣部彭部長也曾以此爲言，但是任何政黨，如果不能替人民的福利着想，如不能爲國家的前途打軍，怎能有光明的前途？所以中共即僅爲本身的前途計，也應該大澈大悟，改變它的宣傳攻勢了。「多行不義必自斃，」政黨間的競爭也還脫不了這定律。專從事於神經戰的宣傳，有什麽用處？</p>
<h3 id="c38">扶植戰敗國政策的檢討 <a href="#c38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>如何處置戰敗國？在目前似乎成了戰勝國家間頗有爭論的問題，而尤以對歐洲戎首的德國爲然。</p>
<p>日前邱吉爾在瑞士沮利希大學演說，主張法德合作，他認爲若無偉大的德國，歐洲即不能復興。貝爾納斯在柏林演說，希望德國能够自足自給、無需聯合國護持，因爲德國不能復興，則歐洲之復興，尤其是與德比鄰各國之復興，均將因之遲綏。德國今天地位重要，世界各國政治家非常重視；英美方面，無論在言論和行動，都正在努力促其復興。這已經是很　然的事實。</p>
<p>德國是這一次戰爭的戎首，而且她的軍國主義，居族優秀的　傲，從普魯十起就普遍的深入人心，並不僅是希特勒和少數納粹黨徒的煽動。她的人民，組織力強，愛國思想極發達，科學智識甚高，假如聯合國給他們一個復興的機會，他們很容易理頭苦幹，在很短的期問，成爲歐洲一個强國。</p>
<p>邱吉爾和貝爾納斯的演說，和英美最近對德佔領區經濟政策的表現，頗使蘇聯和法國特別躭心。蘇聯怕德國復興，重新豎起反共侵蘇的旗幟；法國怕德國重整軍備，再度席捲歐洲。這兩個國家，一東一西，同德國有最密切的關係，他們處處防備德國，也是自然的心理，無足深怪。</p>
<p>但是英美何以不懼怕德國，反而努力去扶特她復興？第一，由於一經濟的負担，爲　佔領德國，美國必須支出庬大的費用，不但要　自己的軍隊，還要救濟飢餓的人民。英國本國的糧食已經覺不够，一直到現在還在厲行分配的制度，然而德國佔領區內的人民也不能讓他們餓死。結果只有向美國借款，運輸糧食從事救濟。嚴重的負担，依然落在美國的肩上。英國固然受不了，美國更受不了！</p>
<p>另外一個原因，就是蘇聯的威脅。自從這一次戰爭結束，蘇聯的領袖懼怕美國，比懼怕德國納粹還要厲害。尤其是今年二月九日史達林親自宣佈，另外一個戰爭不可避免，他的意思當然是于有所指的。從這一天起，蘇聯對內擴充軍備，發展一切和軍事有關的工業與資源。原子彈的硏究，在伯里亞的指揮之下努力進行，汽油的產量，在一九三七年莫斯科國際地質會議，蘇聯自己宣傳世界第一，現在却轉而宣傳油量貧乏，要在伊朗和英美競爭。對外，到處明爭暗奪，樹立傀儡政府，挑起內部衝突，藉以擴充她的安全地帶。在德奧和東歐龐大的駐軍，又遲不撤退。支持南斯拉夫爭取特港，威脅土耳其，共管韃靼尼爾海峽，凡此更顯示她的雄圖。此外在希臘，在朝鮮，日本、甚至於在印度，無處不直接問接和英美發生衝突。雖然史達林元首近方宣布「目前並無戰爭的危險」，但蘇聯實際的行動如此，却又似乎着着在準備戰爭。</p>
<p>由於蘇聯的恐懼，準備鬥爭，因而引起英美的恐懼，準備防禦。但是要防　蘇聯，其它地方的關係小，德國的關係大。德國地處默陸中心，人民能力又高，是西歡天然的屛障，是東西兩大勢力最妙的緩衝。蘇聯早看出這一點，所以在佔領之初，收買民心遠在英美法之上。現在英美也盛覺德國的重要，力圖爭取德國，貝爾納斯和邱吉爾的演說，就是討好德國民衆的表示。德國以一個戰敗國家，却値得被幾個　勝國討好，可見國家民族仍然要靠自己爭氣，自已有出息。</p>
<p>這其間最苦惱的莫過於法國。如一方面怕蘇聯，一方面又怕德國。她不願同英美（澈底合作去扶持德國，她又不敢放棄英美的關係，以致助長蘇聯勢力向西的伸張。而且皮杜爾的政府，在戴高樂的領導之下，已經漸漸爲法國民衆所反對，說不定還有崩潰的危險。</p>
<p>中國話說：「鷸蚌相持，漁人得利」。蘇聯和英美的恐懼和鬥爭，不啻鷸蚌相持，而德國今大的爲人重視，已在坐收漁人之利。豈但德國？義大利不是也正受着美在和會中的支持？麥克阿瑟元帥不是也正在用全力復興日本，甚至麥帥的顧問也在爲了日本的絲業指罵我國的當局嗎？就述法西斯的殘餘，西班牙的佛朗哥，也安然保持勢力。照這樣下去，保不定有一天戰敗國都抬起頭來再事侵略的！</p>
<p>我們很懷疑英美現在扶持戰爭禍首政策的聰明；我們更懷疑蘇聯不合作能度，因而引起英美這種扶助戎首政策的聰明。今天世界和平的關鍵，在於五強的携手。尤其在於美蘇兩國的眞誠携手。他們不携手，世界局面只有越弄越糟。德義日不難重整旗鼓，蘇聯的敵人衆多，固將更不易對付；而美國利用這些侵略國家，將來是否又會重蹈戰前英國「勢力均衡」政策的錯誤，一發而不可收拾？爲美蘇自身利益計，爲世界和平計，還是推誠携手，促成世界五强的充分合作，乃至加强聯合國的種力與威望，以維繫世界的和平，免得侵略國家死灰復燃，人類再這一次空前的浩刧。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕巴黎廿六日廣播：維辛斯基今日在巴爾幹委會中檢討羅馬尼亞之賠償問題，强調羅馬尼亞於一九四四年間參加盟國作戰之重要意義，渠重申蘇聯對此問題之立塲謂，我人要求羅馬尼亞所賠償者，統計羅軍在蘇境西南部份所爲之破壞及掠奪情形，實祗抵及全部損失之五分之一，我人認爲英美方面所提全部賠償之要求爲不公允。維氏謂，羅馬尼亞國內戰痕纍纍，大抵由於盟軍飛機之轟炸，是以羅國不能担負完全責任，亦不能完全承受其後果。職是之故，蘇代表團認爲全部賠償遠反公道與權利云。此項問題本日未獲結束，業經決定改期繼續討論。</p>

<p>〔法國新聞社巴黎廿五日電〕四國外長昨日開會決定爲加緊和曾工作採取措施，迄不在和會各委會中產生任何效果。對義經濟委會。對匃政治及領土委會。曁特里埃斯特小組會，雖均開會頗久，但均鮮有結果。各委會開會情形如次：</p>
<p>在義財產賠償問題</p>
<p>（一）對義經濟委會於本日午後開會，討論聯合國各國人民在義國所有財產，是否應由義國全部或部份賠償一項問題，經辯論後提付表決，結果贊成部分賠償者九票，贊成全部賠償者亦爲九票。委會繼又討論南斯拉夫代表所提出之修正案，主張採用以百分率分別賠償辦法，此項原則卒由委會以十四票予以否決。委會最後通過法代表團之建議，決定賠償額爲百分之七十五。至此蘇代表起立發言，要求法代表團之建議須獲得三分之二始能通過。但委會未予討論即吿散會。</p>
<p>駐匈盟軍撤退期限</p>
<p>（二）對匃政治及領土委會本日開會進展甚緩，討論對匃和約中規定盟軍應在和約簽字後，九十日內全部撤退一項條款。後經澳捷兩國代表自動撤回其修正案，始由委會予以通過。關於英美所提之建議，主張盟國因執行和約條款而發生爭議時，應請國際法庭解決，經冗長之討論後，始獲通過。蘇聯所提出之修正案，主張在此種情形下，舉行直接談判，則爲委會所否決。此外委會並通通對匃和約第散十四條，規定在和約簽字後十八個”內，英美蘇三國外交使節團首長將代表盟國處理一切有關執行和約之問題。（三）特里埃斯特問題小組委會，本日又未獲進展，預料在短期內，尙無法完成其工作，殆已無疑。</p>

<p>史達林曾向松岡謂不致與英親善</p>
<p>〔合衆社東京廿六日電〕據今日在審訊戰犯時所提出之說據稱：蘇聯本擬加入三國公約，但因德國不能迎合史達林之條件而作罷，此係一九四一年三月廿八日德外長李賓特洛甫與已故日外相松岡洋右在柏林會談之記錄所透露者。該項文件證明李賓特洛甫曾密吿松岡，謂德蘇談判破裂以後，德國對蘇不妨徐徐圖之，但李氏指出希特勒頗不懌史達林之態度，倘史氏再有拂逆其意之行爲，渠決心「擊毁蘇聯」。</p>
<p>〔合衆社東京廿六日電〕據今日在審訊戰犯時所提出之證據稱：一九四〇年春，史達林與日前外相松岡洋右會談時，曾力言蘇聯過去從未與英國親善，今後亦不致與英國親善。按松岡於六月間逝世以前，爲候審被吿之一。當一九四一年三月廿七日渠與希特勒商談日本進攻新加坡，作爲日本對德一部分協助之計劃時，渠立刻將史達林之意見報吿於希特勒。</p>
<p>〔聯合社東京二十六日電〕遠東國際法庭今日宣讀德前外長李賓特洛甫備忘錄，其中記載一九四一年二月廿三日李氏接見日前駐德大使大島浩，吿以德國之作戰計劃，略謂：德國已在軍事，政治及經濟上獲勝，但欲迅速結束戰爭。若以閃電之方式佔據新加坡，將强迪英國求和，大島向之保證佔據新加坡之準備，並謂日鋼鐵供給困難，故並不製造四萬五千噸之戰艦，而改造潛水艇，魚雷艇與快艇，以拱衛本土。新加坡必須由陸路進攻，因海上攻勢較爲困難。大島並提及進攻香港與菲律賓之計劃，但李氏促其將此計劃撇開，僅須襲聲新加坡已足，並稱美國尙未武裝，不敢將其鐵鰍細　駛至夏威夷以西。</p>

<p>— 禄煜</p>
<p>導言</p>
<p>本年七月廿九日在盧森堡宮中揭幕之巴黎和會，乃戰後的歐洲從戰爭到和平之途徑上一重要里程碑。如此大事宜乎評論與報導和會之文字，遍載中西報章雜誌。惟此類文字大多係叙述和會開會之經過或預測和會前途之成敗，對於比較本屆和會與廿六年前舉行於凡爾賽宮中之和會的異同點，則尙朱有人詳細論及。但該問題之重要性，決不遜於和會本身之撿討，此固人人皆知也。蓋唯有明瞭上屆和合成功與失敗之處及其原因，然後吾人今日才能一面促進本屆和會之成功，一面避免重蹈過去之覆轍，亦唯有比較兩次和會不同之點，然後才能對本屆和會之內容予以改進，對本屆和會之前途予以推測。本篇之作，即本斯旨。簡言之，本文之目的在企圖從兩次和會之比較中，找出本屆和會不及上屆和會之處，而提供改善方策，以裨益於歐洲局勢之穩定，與世界和平之建立。茲從下列五方面！（一）國際情勢，（二）會議任務，（三）會議職權，（四）組織機構，（五）參加人物！比較兩次和會異同之處。</p>
<p>（一）情勢之不同</p>
<p>第一次大戰後之和會的開幕（一九一九年一月十八日），距康比臬停戰協定之簽字（一九一八年十一月十一日），不及二月，但本屆和會之聚會，離德國之屈服（一九四五年五月八日），已逾一年。從戰事的終結到和會的召集之時間愈長，則和平之前途必愈爲艱難，蓋不但戰時盟國間並肩作戰之合作熱誠，將隨時日之推移而逐漸消失，且因各種棘手問題之相繼發生，列强間之糾紛衝突，亦必層出無窮。此本屆和會之背景所以較上屆和會更爲複雜也。然而目下國際情勢嚴重化之主要原因，則在於和會中東（蘇）西（美·英）兩大集團之對立。正唯東西兩大集團關係之緊張，和會之集會因而遷延至今，亦正唯和會之姗姗來遲，國際情勢遂格外惡化，此點爲上屆和會所未有，而造成本屆和會前途黯淡之最大因素也。在上屆和會中，雖有揭　理想主義的美總統威爾遜與堅持現實政策的法總理克雷孟梭間之對立，但彼此意見之衝突，並不影響和會之順利完成，蓋一則賴有英首相勞合喬治之調停，而在該時英國固仍佔有舉足重輕之地位。二則該時美國之實力，世界各國無出其右，且全球人士一致視美總統威爾遜乃來自新世界之救主，因而咆哮，固執如老虎總理克雷孟梭者，亦不得不對美國與美總統讓步三分。然而今日形勢則不然，美，蘇對立，英國已國力削弱，一切惟美國馬首是瞻，已失去調解之能力與地位，此其一也。美，蘇二國均自以爲乃世界最强之國家，誰也不恐懼誰，且美總統杜魯門於戰爭結束之前夕始執政，魄力，才能，資望均非雄才大略之故總統羅斯福可比，蘇聯之巨人史太林自不願亦不致對美特爲讓步，此其二也。</p>
<p>（二）任務之不同</p>
<p>在此一點上，兩次巴黎和會亦有顯著之不同。一九一九年之和會以討論及簽訂對德國—主要敵國—之和約爲其目標，即後來之凡爾要和約（簽字於一九一九年六月廿八日）是，故其工作之範圍，限於對德之和約。至對於其他四次要敵國—奧·匃·保·土—之和約，則直至巴黎和會閉幕後始陸續與各關係國家分別簽訂之。因之，上屆和會之任務，可以「先重後輕」四字包括之，即首先解決重要而困難之問題，然後再解決次要而容易之問題。今日之和會，適得其反。原在此次大戰中、聯合國之主要敵人，在歐洲爲德國，在亞洲爲日本。本届和會係限於歐洲，即在歐洲之範圍內，亦僅討論對次要的五敵國—義·羅·匃·保·芬—之和約，至主要敵國之德國，則並不包括在內，留待後日另開會議，予以討論。是故，本屆和會之任務，可以「避重就輕」四字稱之，即是將難題（對德）避開，僅就次要難題（對義·羅·匃·保·芬）尋求妥協。正唯上屆和會不畏困難，首先處理主要難題，一解而百解，故會議能於短時期內獲得給果。亦正唯本屆和會，缺乏勇氣，避免討論棘手事件，一拖而百拖，故一月來之巴黎和會，祗見爭論，鮮有成議。此本屆和會不及上屆和會處之又一點也。</p>
<p>（三）職權之不同</p>
<p>上屆和會對於所担負之任務即討論及簽訂對德之和約，享有完全權力，換言之，舉行於凡爾賽宮中之巴黎和會，乃該時之最高權力機關，在其上並無其他機構。此次之和會則不然，其職權僅限於討論四强外長會議所提出的對義·羅·匃·保·芬五國之和約草案（包括已獲得協議之條款及未獲協議炎事項），並得提供修正意見。雖根據和會規程委員會之決議，四强外畏於最後起草和約時，對上述之修正意見，應予以鄭重之考慮而採納之，但此項規定，並未具有法律之性質，一切仍由四强外長會議決定。因此，目下集會於金碧輝皇之盧森堡宮中的巴黎和會，祗是四强外長會議之諮詢機關，旣無討論和約之全權，又不能成立有拘束性質之決議案，，宜乎澳洲代表伊凡特大發牢騷，「巴黎和會不宣僅爲諮詢性質，應賦各國以眞正與有效之參預，是以草擬和約之事，應屬諸各國，不僅屬於三，四強國。」正唯上届和會具有充分職權，故威望高而效率大，所成立之和約，雖不無可議之處，但能於半年內（自一九一九年一月十八日和會開幕起至同年六月廿八日和約簽字止），解決一大難題，在穩定世界局勢的一點上，自河値得稱讚。反顧本屈和會，職權旣有限制，而性質又屬諮詢性質，因之世界各國對之不予重視，故欲期望其發揮宏偉力量，以副全球人民之熱望，實戞戞乎其難哉！</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕全市注目之賽馬問題經前日參議會熱烈討論後仍留爲懸案，賽馬附帶出售彩票是否賭博一節尙待中央之解釋。記者昨特走訪在大會中首先提議請中央解釋之姜屛　律師，詢以我國法律上究係如何規定。據談：此次恢復賽馬問題贊成者與反對者各有相當理由。賽馬本身當然並非賭博，但因賽馬而發行彩票，性質上自與賭博完全相同，惟在法律上是否以賭博論罪，頗有出入。按世界各國對於彩票之發行有採禁止主義者，有採放任主義者，亦有採特許主凝渚。我國法律上則係採取特許主義，徵諸刑法賭博篇第二百六十九條中規定：朱經政府允准而發行彩票者以賭博論罪。由此推論：如經政府允准而發行彩票即非賭博行爲。故關於賽馬發行彩票問題必須向中央請示，方能解決。否則，參議會縱然通過決議認爲並非賭博，朱經中央政府允准特許，逕行恢復賽馬發行彩票，法律上仍應認爲賭博云。</p>

<p>（本報訊）淸査團已決定月底結束返京。兩月來接辦各案之經過。即將列表公佈。未了案件，張委員慶楨仍將繼續負責辦理。至關於孫田昌植一案，昨日發表辦理經過情形如下：</p>
<p>本團對於此案始終認爲係接收處理敵僞物資之重要案件。本團接受密吿後，首先提交委員會議決召集處理局局長，及審議會審議委員，詳詢案情。並調閱全卷後，悉孫田昌植財產曾被査封發還。查對旣係接收之具體行爲，發還又係處理之具體工作，此項接收處理有無不當，本團頗爲車視。經由張委員慶楨負責辦理，傳到密吿人及孫田昌　，分別硏訊。並由吳委員望伋復査，結果認爲案情複雜，非委託司法機關詳加偵査，不足以明瞭處理不當，或接收不當之程度如何，爰經提出委員會議決，移請上海高等法院檢察處偵察。此舉原係尊重司法職權，俾　案情大白。在偵査期間，原密吿人以及孫田昌植均應聽候偵査，不得憑藉任何勢力左右案情。乃聞孫田昌植之妻到處活動，散發傳單，希圖憑藉法外之力，以抗法力，殊屬非是云。</p>
<p>據其法律專家觀察：清查團辦理本案，頗爲審愼而合法，該孫田昌植如係日人，其財產即爲敵產，如非日人，而利用敵僞勢力所獲之財產，亦在沒收之列。如果有獻機及製造軍火資敵行爲，則構成爲戰犯矣。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕根據天文台之報吿，昨日爲本年度之最高潮汎日，工務局特於昨晨招待本市新聞界前往高橋海塘觀潮，並參觀業已竣工之修復海塘決口土程。</p>
<p>昨天前往參觀者，除工務局結構處處長兼海塘工程總隊長朱國洗，副總隊長朱慶玉及專員錢維　外，尙有各報社記者計十三人。雖大雨傾盆，然皆精神抖擻。淸晨八時半登市渡輪，二小時後抵達目的地，當時因未至漲潮時問，故水面離塘邊尙有二十餘公尺。因不堪雨巾久淋，紛往海濱浴塲食堂內撩天。下午一時許，爲潮水之飽和點，再冒雨出發，站於海塘邊，僅見一片汪洋，沙灘皆已淹沒。據朱處長談：若今年之海塘再不加修理，則其後果將不堪設想，如昨目之大潮汎來襲時，堤岸將吿總崩潰，整個高橋鎭，勢將不保矣。</p>
<p>二時半，因至高橋工務局工程總隊辦事處果腹後，即登該局備就之大小卡車兩輛，趕往市輪渡碼頭，小卡車因道路泥濘，機件受潮，於半途忽吿拋錨，於是只得全體擠於無頂之運碎石大卡車中趕路，迨渡輪抵埠，時已六時許，大雨仍厲，個個皆成落湯雞矣。</p>
<h3 id="c85">澳洲亦感房荒　糧食衣着仍厲行配給　澳公使在扶輪社演說 <a href="#c85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕上海扶輪社，昨假都城飯店開會，澳駐華公使柯普蘭即席發表演說，略謂於此次大戰中，澳洲所受之損失，雖不及中英等國之慘重，但爲應付此全面戰爭，亦會動員全國男子百分之六十，從事作戰或戰事工業，女子亦動員百分之三十之多。爲適應戰時需要，並實施勞工管制及配給制度，物價旣嚴予管制，對人民之課稅亦重，務期徑濟得以穩定，並發揮全力，爭取勝利。太平洋戰事發生後，參加實際戰鬥之澳軍數目旣鉅，而同時並將大量必需物資，供給太平洋上，印度及中東之美軍及其他盟軍。人民商業之損失尤重，目前房荒亦感嚴重。若千農田，更因缺乏肥料，無法耕種。故現雖各國對澳洲產物頗感需要，而澳洲實不得不暫以全付精神，從事於應付國內各種問題。惟戰時之努力，已使澳洲於食糧，紡織品，造船業所需之鋼鐵及化學品等物，產量大見增加。光學器械及藥品，亦頗進步。戰爭發生時，澳政府之收入爲八億鎊，後即增至十二億五千萬鎊。戰時物價增高，較前約漲百分二十二·五。</p>
<p>現澳洲仍厲行食糧及衣着之配給制度，所有紡織物因須先供配售本國民衆之用，故出口數量自不得不有所限制。至於食糧方面，澳國產米量不鉅，年產僅二萬噸左右，其中除少量供醫療之用及常地若干華僑之需要外，已全數運往中東亞洲，希於世界米荒聲中，小有裨益。數量雖少，實已包括澳洲產米之總量矣。</p>
<p>澳政府當前之問題爲：（一）除每年建屋五百宅外，先須趕築至少二十五萬宅。（二）整理及修葺因戰時影響而受損失之各項主要產業，如鐵路等。（三）增加生產目前尙感不足之各項物品，如衣料，家庭用具（電氣　備及　箱等）。</p>
<p>柯氏末稱，任何民主國家，欲求確保自由及安全，必須於國防及國內之安定，加以注意。故澳今歲預算中不得不又增一億鎊，而戰前則預算全部亦尙不及一億，故徽稅標準，殊不能恢復戰前情形也。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕昨日人造絲漲風更厲，一二〇號天橋有光開　三百六十五萬元，跳至八十萬元收盤，下午因紡建公司掛牌比上期提高一百萬元，且配給數量减少，以致造成黑市狂抬，由八十萬元喊高至四百十萬元，最後竟喊十五萬元賣出，一般實銷廠商，手足無措，恐慌萬狀，均以爲紡建公司配給失當，迫使廠商　於破產，據業中人言人造絲我國本無出產，向仰給於日意等國。勝利後以商約未訂，運銷維艱。而木外埠電機，針織，絲邊等廠，所需之人造絲，除賴人造絲商號存貨供應外，則爲政府接收之敵僞物資、由紡建公司分期配售。惟自九月五日起，各人造絲商號之配售，即吿取消，純配生產廠商。自是以後，人造絲市况，即步漲不已。蓋以人造絲國內並無生產，與棉紗不同，且銷路不限於電機絲織廠方面。本外埠各廠，恐有缺貨之虞，無不力事搜求。紡建配貨愈少，需求愈切，　致造成人造絲空前之高價。至人造絲商號本身存貨，極爲有限。自紡建停止配售以來，常務更感難於開展。人造絲商業同業公會，曾爲此而函紡建公司呼籲。茲悉己獲紡建公司覆函，略謂待中央信託局自日本運到人造絲後，當再考慮配售辦法云。</p>
<p>意絲之成本　一百十五萬</p>
<p>意貨人造絲，近運到兩批，合共六百箱。據悉：此中四百箱係屬業外人所定之貨，每箱成本價的合五十萬元，稅費的六十五萬元，合共每箱一百十五萬元云　記者旋訪中國紡建公司業務處蔣處長，叩詢該公司配售人造絲情形。渠特聲明兩點：一，紡建所配售之人造絲，俱係敵偽產業處理局所有，紡建僅處代理配售地位。</p>
<p>配價久未動　新盤仍低廉</p>
<p>二，外匯調整後，配價始終屹立不動，每箱配價仍爲一百三十萬元。惟市上激漲不已。昨日配售時，因市價已達三百餘萬元，將配價酌予調整，惟仍較市價低廉的七折之譜。迄目前爲止，先後已陸續配出一萬餘箱。據稱：單以申請配售之各生產廠商而言，每次约有二百餘家。普通廠商，每家一箱，寬緊帶廠等，大多四家合得一箱。昨日共配出二百餘箱，又聞中央信託局已向日本定購人造絲一萬箱，刻已有三千箱抵滬云。</p>

<p>日來因美鈔黑市漲風甚烈，因之生絲市况亦掀起大波，自週一迄今，各級生絲，平均已激升至二成以上，據悉：其激漲之原因，（一）各地絲廠繅製生絲，凡ABCDEF等級者，大抵均曾向中蠶公司借過繅工貸款，故所有F等級以上之成品，全部由中信局收買，並聞巾蠶公司仍州繼續辦理繅工貸款，而中央銀行中信局，中蠶公司，生絲檢騐所四機關將組織絲外銷委員會，擴大收買生絲，拓展外銷，是故今後F等級以上新檢騐單之生絲，勢將不易上市，目下存底亦薄，即F等級以下中級用戶生絲，爲數不過二千擔左右，但綢廠方面，亦因實銷發動，大事抵補原料，對於中級生絲川戶，吸胃正濃，執戶一致看好，堅不　售，（二）由於各種對於生絲有利之謠傳，執戶心理，更形堅定，因而買方扒吸愈力，相互拉抬，扶搖直上，以致中級生絲，突出三百萬元火關，造成近兩月來最高之新紀錄，據業中人云，今後生絲市價，如國際生絲市塲，穩定如恒，漲風一時恐難過止。</p>

<p>外幣美鈔亦吿疲落少許，形勢已吿平定，晨開三九八〇元有賣，開後雖有買戶，但四千元之價有整批待售，中途知難而退，低至三九〇〇元始轉平穩，午刻在三九五〇元左右得徊，午後初時尙平，最後終告微挫，結果較前收下降五〇元，港票平定少變，始終在七八〇元左右徘徊，結果與前收相等，但買價退後一檔，港匯亦平，港中電稍有回升，昨七八〇元有售，印匯亦退爲九六〇元肯賣，英匯一二五〇〇元至一二七〇〇元，美匯牌價雖平，但乏動作。三四萬，十六支因連日漲勢太猛，已超過二十支價，故昨日尙屬平靜，午後市况依然堅挺，因各路搜求不懈，價亦報升，聞四十二支　單，已做二百八十餘萬，二十支更形堅俏，民營紗廠，鑒於實銷旺盛，心思頗高，曾要求當局放寬，據權威方面透　消息，外匯變率以前受配之花衣，尙有數萬件，要求照舊率結匯，而形勢所趨，恐不能如願，故配紗之價，恐須再漲。</p>

<p>華股昨買戶見稀，縱有廣帮北帮來進，但爲數不多，易於被浮多所壓倒，晨開見低後，未能回振，開後微現堅穩，不久即遭壓倒，在普遍性之斬多下，逐步見疲，中途曲折甚少，成交亦轉現閑散，十一時半後，始有空方補進，金融帮若四四號中國信託，購進美亞，廣帮亦微納紗廠，一度見秀，但臨收時北帮有所了結，廣帮亦售公司，又吿萎靡，結果較前收計永紗景福新光勤興各跌半成左右，美亞微跌，冷股中統　景綸微挫，中紡榮豐內衣絲業華豐五和跌半或左右，信和大通新亞公司麗安火柴水泥各挫一成左右，總成交額計七七六萬餘股，塲外各股亦有帶小。</p>

<p>— 特派員邵愼之</p>
<p>十四日蚌埠訊</p>
<p>兩淮眞像一雙顚簸着的盤子，水與烽火攪成一團。</p>
<p>津浦夜車到蚌埠是深夜，蚌埠在十一時半一聲砲響，開始戒嚴，十二時後旅客不得入城，全露宿在車站上。用手電一照，只見島沈沈的一片全是人，在秋露中鼾聲四起，燈光　淡，戰爭的暗影籠罩在四周。</p>
<p>一位Railway－man向我訴苦，說極容易被軍人吃生活，半年以來，軍軍過處，幾乎每個站上都演過全武行，他本人即曾挨凑過。前幾天就有宿縣南凌家橋的站長飽嘗了一頓老拳。原因很簡單，他們不能接受這些士兵和下級軍官的命令式的要求。那些要求往往十分滑稽而且違背行車的常識，如馬上發路籤，不准後來的客車先開出去之類。軍委會「軍人不得干涉站長行車職權」的命令也沒有川，除非每個站長有一個上校領章，一枝手槍，那麽立刻會靠攏脚跟，併得連一絲縫都沒有，忘却發癢的拳頭，這要比講道理强得多。</p>
<p>會見夏威</p>
<p>第八綏靖區司令官夏威，是北伐各將，抗戰中戍守桂南，著有戰功，現在坐鎭蚌埠。我自正陽關折返時，投刺往謁，欣然接談，謙遜謂：「余所知不多，但願儘就所知相答。</p>
<p>我們的談話不過廿分鐘，在軍事範圍內，關於皖省情形，獲得了一個輪廓，兩點結論。</p>
<p>（一）皖省各縣，現在都在政府掌握中，有些一地方曾經是「解放區」，但大部份不是，曾經是「解放區」的地方目前還有武裝向國軍進擾，別的地方也有自稱共軍的，地方多不安定。自稱共軍的實際上是匪，共黨用之則即成爲共軍，夏威作結語謂：匪就是匪，決不能共黨用之就不是匪，或者自稱共軍之後就不是匪。</p>
<p>（二）關於李先念部，他說；「有三千人向皖中柬竄，但沿途死傷，能越過淮南路而去蘇北的僅一千餘人。」除此之外，未能證實有別部共軍經過皖省。但目前皖西，還有共軍存在，那是張體學部。他向我承認這點，但「不過幾百人。」</p>
<p>我曾經獲知有一部份共軍自英山經三河尖，渡穎河而至徐州外圍，他的部下吿訴我：「原是一股匪，後來成爲李先念部的共軍，而現在又不是了，不過幾百人。</p>
<p>專員長談</p>
<p>共軍，自稱共軍，爲共軍承認的自稱共軍、爲共軍收編的僞軍，不自稱什麼的匪，原來是匪，在共軍中攪了一陣之後不幹了的匪，原是偽軍待命整編而不幹了的匪，……國軍則掌握着城鎭與交通錢，別的地方，常有誰也分辨不淸的武裝活躍着，而各方往往一律稱之謂共軍。安徽地方報紙上也經常登載着「共軍到處竄擾」的消息，結果自然是到處打。勝負如何？乃是太不重要的問題了。</p>
<p>摘幾條最近的「軍息」；由此可見皖政舉步維艱的情形，一。共軍皖西獨立團長，桂林西部人槍千餘，由潛山境內竄入太湖一帶，一部六百餘，已回竄潛屬標林河一帶；二，張體學部約五百人，由宿松縣屬陳漢出擾，經堵擊後竄黃梅求家山，三。共軍江北大隊長劉先志率部八百餘，近由江南竄蕪、膚。集。境內之齊頭咀、白石山、銀屛山一帶活動，四、潰　靈北，及　河沿岸共軍的二萬餘，連日征伕數千，在陳塲集。時集、架設浮橋、構築工事；五、共軍魏鳳樓部，配吳又壽，金少山等部，兵力共八千餘，由豫東大城，柘城等處，竄毫縣境內，截斷商亳公路。</p>
<p>皖省第四區，包括蒙城、懷遠。五河。泗陽。靈璧。五縣、正經戰火，刧難最重，需要聽聽地方官的聲音。專員公署在宿縣，我到宿縣去看專員廖梓英，在深院寂寂的專署中作長談，他指向東北，指向西南，說：「都有共軍。」</p>
<p>「淸官不好做，貪官不能做。這位五十九歲的老專員慨乎言之。他是鳳台縣人，光緒間卒業於安徽武備學堂，北伐時期是旅長，今年七月才從皖南調來。</p>
<p>專署印象</p>
<p>談話時天氣很熱，運身出汗，說是熱得好，莊稼才長得結實。聽到吃飯要燒柴火，這裏劈柴賣一百元一斤，可是軍隊只出五元，規定的價格。每人每天至少要兩斤，只有十塊錢，我不禁問：如如何彌補？」他把頭一抬，朝着　樑上瞪眼，不開口，後來站起來指着窗外對我說，隔壁是一所中學校，現在沒法開學，「前天開會淸査，單桌櫈就丟了一百八十幾件。」於是是坐下來喝口茶，長嘆一聲，說道：「兵，凶器也。天下沒有不擾民的兵，這個東西的破壞性大極了，國家非萬不得已，決不能輕易用兵，平心而論，軍隊紀律，不如抗戰！</p>
<p>專署職員薪水一百八十成，生補費三萬五千元，別的什麼也沒有了。一天吃兩頓饝饝稀飯，就去了三萬七千五。勤務兵一萬七千五百元，吃也不够，薪水數只三十二元，希奇透頂，衣也沒有，鞋也沒有；專署公費每月三萬二千元，旅費一萬七千六百元。一個月光郵費要一萬多，不設打電報，點一桶洋油就要幾萬，紙墨筆硯更不用談。</p>
<p>「我對李主席說過，督査不要了，一萬七千六百元不够外勤一趟，現在要派人出去視察，總要打擾地方。關於基層政治，他說：專員還不及鄕長的責任大，民財建敎糧，他什麼都要管，現在的鄉長不怕縣長，只怕法院，可是法院又不管壞人，只管好人。安徽地方幹部也曾訓練過十萬人，假使一德一心，這些人自然能上能控制縣長，下能訓導民衆，可是三個月訓練能得到些什麽？衣服穿得很好，結果是做壞事的多，做好事的少。」</p>
<p>他吿訴我他在抗戰中任渦陽縣長一年，中共彭雪楓部過來搞統一戰綫了，「眞是刀對刀，槍對槍過了一年啊！我對彭雪楓說，你不要到渦陽來搞，我如是貪官汚吏該槍斃了倒可以，否則你過來亂搞，我是要打的，他拿我沒辦法。」結果一年後卸任交代，此後渦陽縣廿七鄕鎭立刻面目全非。於是他結論說：「人的因素，可說很重要。」</p>
<p>現在宿縣有復員靑年軍幾千人，縣裏派他們當鄉保畏，都說不幹，却住在那　領錢吃飯，每月地方負担百多萬、廖專員說在五河，泗縣，靈璧，要去建立鄕鎭公所實在還不容易，性命交關，共軍的便衣還到處伏　，有點能力的肯去幹嗎？可是沒有能力的又辦不了、於是，這位老專員又搖一陣頭。</p>
<p>用晚餐了，稀飯，饝饝，四碗大鍋素菜，沒有油水：靑菜，綠荳芽，靑菜炒豆腐皮，還有一碟子靑辣椒。專員因中午來客，添做了兩個葷菜，晚上還有多的，我被邀入座，吃完以後，專員喚勤務兵把那碗沒有吃完的炒醬，端到樓上去放起來，留下一餐再吃。</p>
<p>善救工作</p>
<p>善救工作在這裏表現得比較緊張，分要設在蕪湖，蚌埠設辦事處，分署工作人員之半都在道裏，我在蚌埠看到副署長柯育甫，他說：皖北工作很重要，聯總也要到這裏來，設辦事處，正在找房子。」他總結分署的工作到八月底止，作了一次詳盡的說明：其中包括振務，衛生，儲運，農業，工業，和最近計劃六項。</p>
<p>在振務這個項目下，有「救濟」與「工振」兩部份。「工振」的範圍非常廣泛，包括修堤築堰，濬河堵口，修復校舍，辦淸潔隊，辦縫紗工廠，甚至翻修蕪湖和蚌追的馬路。這簡直是在辦建設工程，不禁使人想到羅斯福的藍鷹還動，而現在的善救工作也是打政治官司的材料。在他報吿中的「救濟」項目下，把「推進共區救濟」，與「遺送難民還鄉，辦理皖北急賑，救濟津浦錢難民，配發舊衣舊鞋，設立牛奶站麵粉站等，列於同等地位。我不禁問：「道有偏頗嗎？」</p>
<p>柯副署長這樣說：善後救濟工作，原無分畛域，更沒有政治派別的差異，皖分署曾經特別組織皖東北區工作隊，深入共區，辦理善後救濟工作，並配發麵粉一百餘噸，以及舊衣，藥品，牛奶，奶粉等，由工作隊隊長黃晋珩，偕同蚌埠天主敎華神父，及西入莊同禮（Drane）等，前往發放，最近對於皖東北十五縣，又撥麵粉一千噸，由本署辦事處傅處長負責監發他又說：「我們沒有偏頗，軍事行動使我們受了阻碍，但我們還要繼續到共區去做。」不過戰端旣起，在共軍的戰略要求是最好完全破壞國軍後方所有的交通綫，必要時把堤堰挖開，以便恃水而固，於是就和善救署的工作大相逕庭。於是宣傳戰中在他們頭上大打官司。不過如鳳陽縣北的淝河口，淤塞已久，農田受害，以工代賑，挖掉五萬多土方，四十餘萬畝的農田得救，這地方就是善救署所稱的共區。</p>
<p>驚險遭遇</p>
<p>不過我還疑心他們是不是心存偏頗，而不過在表面上做一點點綴。皖東北工作隊長黃晋珩對我作極詳細的說明，說述他十分驚險的工作經過。他說：</p>
<p>我們爲了要在皖東北共區中展開工作，，六月底，在甫京向周恩來接洽，他非常贊成，給我們證明書和介紹路綫，到淮陰去和蘇皖邊區政府的負責人接洽，我們立刻取道追揚州邵伯而進入共區，會見了他們軍方的華中區司令和衛生部長，因爲軍事緊張，邊區政府的負責人都在鄕間，但終於會晤了韋捧丹副主席，接洽之後，商定由共方，分署，聯總的代表各一人，成立一個小組，決定（一）以工振爲原則，修築淮提，自臨淮關至五河段，這工程由復堤工程局去負責，不還發放麵粉的數量，共方要求增加，（按復堤局規定，每方土發粉二斤至四斤，）以符合他們的政策。同時（二）修築洪湖大堤，皖境七十多華里，工程由皖署負資；（三）疏濬泗河；（四）洪澤湖中有漁民五萬多，冬季無魚可捉，需要救濟；（五）衛生方面，瘧疾，黑熱病，夏季傳染病，皮膚病都很普遍，需要藥品，各地有「人民醫院」，因此僅有招牌，缺少實際工作。</p>
<p>獲得以上的結論之後，自淮陰返蕪湖報吿，我們初步先運送營養物資和藥品，以應急需，包括奶粉，配尼西林，黃白凡士林，DDT，夏令防疫苗，奎寗等，共二百多箱，七月廿八日自　雇一條大木船東開，聯總的莊同禮同行。經臨淮關廿里路，即被嚴厲檢査，這是第一關，給他們看周恩來和邊區政府的證件，回答是前面可以去，不過危險。每隔七八里，總有人檢査，盤問極詳，有些地方竟要把我們扣留，五河正在開火，到五河時共軍已退去，乃在砲火中繼續到盱眙去，敗退下來的共軍要船波河，向船上放槍，看見莊同禮穿卡其衣服，以爲中央軍，拿手溜彈威脅我們，一路費盡　舌，每隔二三里總要被槍彈射擊，總算在晚間到達雙溝，各處槍聲，又來檢査，是水上公安局的人，看到外國人的東西，什麽都好，什麽都要拿。共軍在這裏設泗南縣政府，次日上岸，他們的人都跑了，遇到當地一位漕坊老闆，才找着他們的縣長，他們知道我們有物資送去，而這時正是軍事行動時期，我們在船上與他們的常地代表開會，由他們出具收據，把二百多箱東西交給他們。</p>
<p>他們就這樣結束了一段飄流的故事。他們離開共區，就如進入無人之境，亳無檢査，回到明光（邵愼之攝）</p>

<p>靑年及勞働界患者最多生命堪處</p>
<p>編者先生：邇來見各報信箱問答肺病渚，爲數激增，可見肺結核病菌之猖獗，而患者日增一日，前途殊堪憂慮！國人素有東亞病夫之稱，本市人口稠密，病又極易傳染，一般患者，多係靑年及勞工階級，一經染病，即爲絕症，二期三期一至，坐以待斃，中西醫師，亦束手無策。筆者近曾參觀某療養院，爲全身檢查及照X光者，竟接連而來，而每次費用須一萬餘元，勞働階級與一般赤貧，祇得望院興嘆！希望各醫院能於例假日，優待一般貧病患者，給於免費檢査X光照肺，謀貧病及勞工之福利，實一强國强種之要道。並望本市衛生當局，提倡撲滅肺癆運動，使這可怕的傳染病菌，不易傳佈，則市民幸甚。上述意見懇賜予披露爲荷。敬頌　安　趙劉上</p>

<p>— 張明</p>
<p>本月十六日本市大公報登載下面一節消息：</p>
<p>重慶市民醫院內，十四日有中西醫師當塲「鬥法，演出一幕趣劇。緣有中醫史丹書者，屢在各報刋登大幅廣吿，宣傳發明「脈診肺病」，百試百靈。市衛生局以事出離奇，特於十四日下午五時命史醫師至市民醫院作臨床實騐，將住院病人張宜福任正强二人抬出，請其診斷。史脈診結果，斷定張宣福肺病三期，左肺第一至第二肺骨間有結核，右肺有洞，下端潰燜；任正强爲肺病二期之後期，左肺有洞，右肺結核。嗣由衛生局科長陳思義命市民醫院醫師將二病人抬入愛克司光室透視，證明張宜福肺部正常無病，任正强僅有右肺上端有鈣化黑點一處，與史丹書之診　元全不符。陳科長請史說明理由，史丹書大窘，狼狽萬狀。衛生局已勒令史丹書停止營業，禁刋廣吿，聽候調査懲辦。</p>
<p>在庸　與假藥的廣吿到處充斥的現在，看到這段消息，不啻一服淸凉散，覺得十分痛快。重慶市衛生局沒有遵守「多一事不如少一事」的衙門守則第一條，更沒有認爲這是「小事而不管，而處理得又如此科學，如此乾脆，如此公平。吾們向重慶市衛生局致敬。</p>
<p>在上海，多少騙子掛着醫生的招牌，把病人的性命當做兒戲，不管有病無病，不管對症不對症，爲着歛財，外科硬要開刀，內科硬要打針。而廣吿醫生中，有多少位是醫德爲重，服務第一？有多少位是不把醫業當作營業，不把金錢放在服務的前面？至於藥物方面，假藥劣藥更是充斥市塲，而有的滑頭藥，竟在衛生　給證承認之下，在報紙上大登欺騙廣吿。</p>
<p>在最自由的英美，不正當的醫藥廣吿也受政府的取締，因爲醫藥影響人民健康，民族前途，不能視作普通商業與普通商品。</p>
<p>希望本市的衛生當局，急起直追，嚴格取締庸醫假藥，以保障市民的健康。</p>
<h3 id="c150">破傷風 <a href="#c150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>— 錢德</p>
<p>其病原及其預防</p>
<p>破傷風是創傷感染破傷風桿菌以後，由其外毒素所引起的全身中毒症狀。乃是一種嚴重的傳染病，發病後治療無甚把握，未病前却是不難預防，並且預防的效果極爲良好。要瞭解破傷風桿菌如何染入創傷而引起症狀，我們首先要對該菌有一些認識。牠正常存在於牛馬及人的糞便之中，一經排出體外，以芽胞狀態存在，抵抗力極强，如日光及普通藥物所能殺死。所以任何地方，特別以糞便爲肥料的田地，都有該菌的沾染；而任何創傷，不論槍砲傷裂傷乃至玻璃，鐵絲，木片小針刺傷，祗要有創口，都有自泥土，汚染的針片或　皮膚梁人此菌的可能，創口愈大，則受染的可能性也愈多。旣經受染之後，病菌局限於該部。</p>
<p>至於症狀的產生，完全由於該菌所產生之外毒素，經神經，血液，淋巴管至中樞神經，引起激刺現象，而外毒素又祗在無抵抗情形下才產生，所以儘管她正常存在於陽中或體表，不生禍害，而一人創口，則創傷部的壞死組織旣能供給該菌以更多的養料，如有沘合的化膿菌傳染，消耗其間的　，並削弱組織的警衛力量—吞噬細胞—又能使其　育更趨旺盛。所以可以說：創口愈大愈深，愈適於其存在；及之，雖然創口細小，祗要有病菌接種人組織深處，同樣能發生禍害。此外，也可能在手術時（包括非法墮胎）自刀口傳入，或者於舊創處施行手術將原已染入而在潛伏狀態的病菌重新攪動，也有因舊法接生，用米消毒剪刀截斷　帶，使無　嬰兒受染血遭到不幸的。</p>
<p>此便提到，破傷風普通於受染幾天至二三後發生症狀，一其時發日的　創或已愈合。最　的症狀是咀　、張口，吞咽困難，繼乃　背腹肌强直收縮，角弓反張。小小刺激與震動能引起肌肉陳擊性疼痛收縮，於數小時至</p>
<p>一二週內因呼吸成心臟衰竭或體力衰竭而致死。最痛苦的是病人的神志始終淸楚。</p>
<p>然而病症發生的時間與其結果，又視其受傷情形，受傷部位及曾否受過預防注射而定，大槪頭面部受傷或初生兒感染，症狀發生較早，預後亦惡劣，死亡率恒在百分之九十五以上。而受過預防注射及適當醫藥處理的，可遲至一二個月以後才發作，其症狀也呈慢性或局限於一部，這一類的結果大都良好。一般言之，發生症狀後一星期不死，則多拖一天其痊愈的希望也隨之增加。根據以上的叙述、我們可以知道破傷風是可怕的病症，而其可怕性則可由施行預防而大爲減少。下列數點爲必需注意之事項：</p>
<p>（一）勿用舊式產婆接生。</p>
<p>（二）注意皮膚淸潔，並妥加保護，勿使受傷，致予破傷風榫菌以侵人組織之機會。</p>
<p>（三）急救外傷出血，應用自來水或冷開水冲洗後，加敷消毒紗布，萬勿用門角灰或泥土撒塗。</p>
<p>（四）創傷應請醫院醫治，汚染物應洗淨，外物碎片應取出，壞死的組織應截除。創口應的量打開，幷用氧化劑　洗。</p>
<p>（五）兒童及易於受傷的士兵，應注射破傷風類毒素，三星期一次共二次，使體內產生對該菌之自動免疫力，在受傷後再注射一次以提高其抵抗力。如果未曾受此預防注射，則在受傷之後，應即予以抗毒素以備萬一。</p>
<p>（六）倘然已經發生破傷風之病狀，應即送醫院治療。</p>
<h3 id="c151">人人應有的　防癆知職 <a href="#c151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>— 徐長文</p>
<p>關於防癆，至少可以分二點來講：第一是如何防止痰中帶有肺癆菌的病人傳染給健康人；第二是如何使初期肺癆患者早日發現早日醫治，不使進人惡化而達不治狀態。</p>
<p>第一點也就是一般人所認爲的防癆，其中包括注重個人衛生，禁止隨地吐痰，病者飲食隔離，食具消毒，病者勿去公共塲所，以及療養院之設置等等，大家都知道，却沒有切實的做到。也許知道得不透澈，所以作者在這裏加以解釋。平常有許多肺癆病人，雖患有二期或三期肺癆，可是仍能勉强行動，不過其痰中必定含有癆菌，若隨地吐痰，則痰內癆菌可能於痰乾後在塵土中飛揚而復爲他人呼吸入氣管而形成肺癆之起因。病者飲食及用具必需與他人隔離，最好一人獨食，唯因環境不允許，而欲與人同餐桌，則必需用衛生筷制；同時病者用過的碗筷等器具，應放在熱水中煮沸五分鐘，以防間接傳染。病者咳嗽時宜背他人之面，並以手帕緊掩口鼻，以免痰沫飛濺，傳染他人。平時咳嗽在陽光下可應見唾沫飄越一二丈遠，此種距離，決非一般人所能想像者。即病者談話時，亦應與常人距離至少一丈。療養院之設置，一則以治療病者，一則可藉此與外界隔離而杜絕傳染。</p>
<p>關於第二點，普通人均極忽略，也就是作者所擬特別提醒之處。目前在特效藥未曾確實發明之前，最佳之防癆與治癆原則莫若於「早日發現早日診治。平常以爲一經咯血，即疑爲成癆，但亦有不表現咯血症狀而已爲第二期甚至第三期肺癆者甚多。故欲早日發現必須注意常人所不經意之師癆早期症狀，如易感疲　，體重减少等，一旦發現，即應接受螢光透視肺部。常人如能每隔三月透視一次，一年中檢査四次則更安全。此種螢光透視之費用極低，即一般苦力，亦能負担。四次檢査結果康健，則一年身心舒適。如若某人在三月份及六月份肺部淸晰而在九月份發現肺部有黑斑或不淸之處，則其病灶範圍定必渺小，因肺癆之進行多爲緩性，而爲時亦僅間隔二三個月。若能把握時機，立即聽從醫師詳細指導，加以適當治療，其結果多甚良好。即或發現病灶擴大及蔓延，亦可採用壓縮治療以抑止之，而達近乎完全治癒之目的。</p>
<p>反之，如患咯血或劇烈咳嗽而就醫者，經醫師診斷服藥後，病狀　轉緩。若病者誤認病已痊愈而忽　師內病灶之演變，直待第二次取第三次復發一後再行就醫、那時肺內病灶往往巳經　延，或已潰成空洞，病者體形怯弱，此時即使醫者再盡心治療，其效果亦難斷言，而成事倍功半的結果。萬一得救，病者已受盡精神上之痛苦與經濟上之損失。</p>
<p>所以我們除了消極地預防痰　的傳佈之外，更應積極地注重病灶的演進，早日發現平日治療」是避免　入不治之淵的唯一南針。</p>
<h3 id="c152">咯血 <a href="#c152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>— 警士豪</p>
<p>你如果一向身體很好　然有一天發現了痰　帶着血。你一定會覺得十分驚　沮喪，即刻去找醫生。找醫生　應該的，但　惶沮喪却大可不必，因爲這或許竟是你的幸運。醫生也許會診斷出你的肺內有一點結核病，及早治療起來尙不費事；假使沒有血痰這會事，你是決不會去找醫生診視的，於是病症可能在你的不知不覺中進行到嚴重的程度。</p>
<p>肺癆病人中　血的佔百分之五十至九十。但　血的原因並非僅此一種，別的胸部疾患能致此症狀的有：（一）肺硬化症，（二）心　　　辯狹窄，（三）百日咳，氧管炎，肺氧　等有劇烈咳　的病癥，（四）胸部創傷，（五）支氣管性肺炎，大　性肺炎，（六）肺囊腫，（七）支氣管擴張癥，（八）肺　　形成（Pulmonary　Lnfarction），（九）肺瘤　，肺　　，肺梅毒，（十）肺徵菌病如念珠狀菌病等，（十一）主動脈　　穿破至肺部，（十二）肝部或別處　　穿破入肺部，（十三）肺部寄生蟲病如包　虫，肺二口蟲病等。</p>
<p>咯血必需與冒出血，鼻血，及因　部疾患而起的出血區別。此外血液本身的病變，如血友病，白血病，紫　病，惡性貧血等也都能引起血痰，</p>
<p>肺結核病的出血可以分爲兩　：一類是由於血管破裂之故，例如肺部的結核性空洞中血管形成　　，破裂之後，能引起大量的咯血；一類是由於血管壁受病理變化後起了變態反應，其渗透性增加，於是血靑，血球等易於滲出，這種出血往往極爲輕微。</p>
<p>找畢咯血的原因，和治療出血，都是醫生的事。病面所應注意的，第一是絕對靜臥，制止咳嗽，和避免　　。多動多咳和驚惶不安，能使血壓增高，也使血管破裂處　合，因而出血不能停止。記住：直接因咯血而致死的病例。一百人中不過一二人而已，所以怕懼是不必要的。醫生治療咯血，第一也是投以鎭靜劑，和止咳劑，胸部使用欲要减少局部血流和减少胸部的運動。止血劑的應用尙是。在適當的病例中，用人工氧胸術止血，可收奇效。輪血和外科手術有時也屬必要。飲食方面，　血利害時抵能吃些軟質或流質的東西，以冷爲宜。病人不可自己動手，須由家人或護士喂給他吃。</p>
<p>最後，筆者想在此糾正一個誤觀念：九是許多人以爲痰中帶血絲較大量咯血更爲嚴重，但事實上肺癆病者有　血和不咯血者，並無病情輕重之分。在今日中國肺癆猖　時期，凡咯血者或痰內帶有血絲者，吾人均須疑其有肺癆，除非經詳細檢査後確定其非結該性者外，吾人應牢記肺癆病爲　血之最大原因。</p>
<h3 id="c153">人與病菌之戰　（四） <a href="#c153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>— 喬樹民</p>
<p>摘自「傳染病管理」　（三）感受性及抵抗力</p>
<p>（二）特殊抵抗力—免疫力</p>
<p>吾人於上述的普通抵抗力外，對於某種疾病，更可有所謂特殊的抵抗力，以抵抗某種特殊的病菌。如吾人罹患傷寒，則吾人體內產生一種物質，可與傷寒病菌或其產物，起某種對抗的反應，此種激發對抗物質之物質？謂之「抗原。抗原爲膠狀物質，多爲蛋白質成份及其附着素（Hapten）所組織，其所激發之抗體，皆各具獨特性。如各種抗毒素，凝集素，沉澱素，噬菌素，抗攻擊素，溶菌素，溶細胞素，防禦素（補體），皆抗體也，皆各有其獨特性。</p>
<p>（三）與抵抗力有關之副因素：</p>
<p>如有人欲將對於傳染病之抵抗力，訂一正常標準，殊不可能，因吾人在各個生活附段中，在不同自然環境中，一切營養，疲勞，以及其他時時變動之生理狀態，均在在影鄉於抵抗力之消長也，試略論之：</p>
<p>A年齡</p>
<p>在嬰兒時代，其血淸對於傷寒桿菌白喉桿菌，大腸桿菌，葡萄球菌等殺之菌力及溶血力，較遠成人者爲低。此足解釋嬰兒之較易感受一般膿毒傳染，嬰兒血淸內之抗毒素，的與母體者相將，故可免罹若干傳染病於一時，但嬰兒所含之此類抗毒素均爲被動性的，不能持久，以抗原爲膠狀物質，不能透過胎盤而輸入嬰體，因而不能使嬰兒產生自動性的免疫力也。査初乳每富含原，惟可否產生免疫力，尙馬疑問。原虫的傳染病，多無顯　之免疫力。故嬰兒對於一般原虫所致之病，機會曾不稍少。</p>
<p>初生兒血內之多核性白血球，约佔70%，至六個月時，即降至36%，其後又逐漸增加，至六歲時，可升至60%。又嬰兒血液之鹽基度，僅及成人者百分之七十至八十，此對於　毒傳染之抵抗，殊屬不利。嬰兒胃液之鹽酸，亦較爲稀少，此亦不利於抵抗力者。</p>
<p>年齡衰老者，其各種新陳代謝之機能降低，抵抗力弱而感受性高。惟此爲病理的性質，而嬰兒則爲生理的性質耳。</p>
<p>試就各國各年齡組之死亡率觀之，則最高者厥爲初生兒，其後即與時日俱减，直至十歲左右，達於最低限度。其後又隨年齡而遞增，至一〇五歲時，死亡之機會蓋已超過生存之機會矣。此種演變之趨勢，自難概論，要可窺見抵抗升降與年齡關係之一班。</p>
<p>B性別</p>
<p>男女性別之生理構造不同，尤以內分泌作用爲逈異，硏究人類壽命者，威知女性壽命，較男性者爲長，蓋其對於傳染病之感受性較男性者爲低也，大抵男女兩性身體上之每顆細胞，均有互異之處。</p>
<p>C種族</p>
<p>研究歡醫學者，最易發現抵抗力或感受性之種族的差異。吾人試一比較人類各種族間對於某種疾病之抵抗力或免疫力，亦每可發現相當的差異。惟研究種族差異，所有各種外界因素所可引致之差異，均當摒剔，始得謂爲眞正的種族差異。請再言外界因素所可引致之差異：</p>
<p>D營養</p>
<p>災荒饑饉之歲，每足招致疫癘，所謂「大戰之後，必有凶年，」此吾人所共知者，但吾人殊亦未能貿然謂營義不良，即爲疫厲之直接的原因。營養不良者，其對於各種傳染病之抵抗力，誠皆降低。但吾人亦迄無明證，以論斷營養不良者即致感染率增　也。大抵吾人對於急性傳染病之抵抗，多爲獨特性，其感染多視傳染機會而定；但於慢性傳染病如結核，麻風，　疾之類，則營養因素，顯至重要。</p>
<p>營養過度，對於疾病抵抗力，亦可發生暫時的影響，Arnhld氏會觀察食用蛋白質過多之腸內細菌數目，增殖甚多，且腸　滲透性亦抗進，致使細菌得侵人腸壁之淋巴管內云。</p>
<p>甲種及丙種維生素缺乏時，對於一般傳染病之感受性，頗爲增加，但正常人服用多量之田，種及丙種維生素時，亦並不足以額外增高其抵抗力。關於他種維生素及其他營養素對於抵抗力的升降關係，目下尙無充分資料，可供論斷。</p>
<p>E疲勞</p>
<p>疲勞因素對於抵抗力之影響，不易測定，蓋疲勞之際，同時恒有饥餓，胃口不良，精神　于頹，或暴露於不適宜之環境下等等情節存在。且疲勞每爲一般傳染病初發之微兆，未必盡爲誘因，惟疲勞可以激發潛伏性傳染，並助長病勢的蔓延，則不乏實騐的證明。</p>
<p>F氣候</p>
<p>氣候對於抵抗力之升降影響，似爲一般流行病學者所共注意。但其間詳確關係如何，亦殊無人能道其詳。其中大槪以溫度及濕度二者之影響較大。變動過劇之溢度及濕度，足以降低上呼吸道之抵抗力，腸胃之殺菌力，似亦同時降低，腸壁之參透性，亦可增進云。</p>

<h3 id="c154">蘇格蘭詩人　彭思 <a href="#c154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>— 沈立人</p>
<p>二百五十年祭</p>
<p>今年是彭思（Robert　Burns）逝世二百五十週年。這位蘇格蘭的詩聖，爲了他的作品太富於地方色彩和音樂感，常使得崇仰他的人在翻譯時覺得難以下手；因之，在中國，他還不曾跟其他顯赫的泰西詩客一樣，爲一班人士所熟悉。</p>
<p>他是蘇格蘭地方愛爾村（Ayrsgire）的土著，那小小的村落，就因他而成名。在那小村中，現在還留有一座醜陋的茅屋，春秋二李時有無數旅客去游歷，徘徊嘆息於泥石砌築的短牆左近，這就是彭思父親所一手建立起來的，更就是這位大詩人誕生的血地。</p>
<p>彭思的哥哥羅比（Robbie）也是一著名的騷人，他們一家，祖傳下來都是以農爲業。彭思在學校裏只逗留過二一年，從九歲起，就開始在田間做活，故而在他後來寫出的好多瑰麗的韻語裏，我們常似乎嗅得出有泥土氣息。他的父親是一較開通的農伕，很期望他的子弟們能得到敎育。冬天的黃昏或夏季的月夜，老彭思常講些書本上的故事給孩童們聽；同時，母親又教他們唱着種種謠曲。正和其他好多傑出的文豪一樣，他們的天才的所以能薰陶而發揮出來，全賴於家庭間的藝術　　。</p>
<p>爲了這樣，彭思便開始對於傳奇和詩歌發生了興趣，不論是在驟車趕集或是徘徊在阡陌上，甚至於就餐時，都時常從袋裏抓出小册子來誦唱。漸漸地，他居然也學會了寫詩，在閑暇時唸給鄕鄰們聽，大家都喜悅地稱贊，說他的「山歌」很好聽，很新鮮。</p>
<p>二十三歲時，他父親去世了，他們一家人換了塊土地居住，工作得更勤苦，而他的詩亦日趨成熟。有一次，他偶然用鋤子毁去了田鼠的窠穴，他內心歉仄着，因爲冬天已近而那小動物却沒有了家；他寫了首詩發揮他的憂鬱，後來他說，從這天起，才決意做一個詩人。</p>
<p>他在二十五歲時遇到他未來的妻子愛默（Armour），這時他想到西印度去採稿，他大胆地出版他的第一本詩集，結果，爲了報酬的菲薄，他只能到愛丁堡去，在那詩人叢集的城市，他很快地得到歡迎，很快地露出頭角，很快地成名，一連又印行過二本詩册。</p>
<p>愛丁堡的朋友們介紹他一職業，是當邊境的收稅吏。他的新生活使他經常地策馬馳驅，往來於人跡罕見的荒域，他常常在黝黑的夜裏穿林越嶺，　雨戴　，但他的詩頁亦愈增愈厚了。後來，他墮落了，他陪同一批下流的朋友們儘在酒店的地窖裏度荒唐歲月；他未嘗不想振拔，然而在每次他經過長途的寒峭奔突後，他只有在那迷漫着烟霧的屋頂下，才能找得一絲溫暖和欣愉。終於他失去了他的健康，這對於整個世界是何等可惜的損失啊！</p>
<p>也許因爲生活的反常或太懂得憂鬱，任何　大的詩人都是短壽的。雪萊祇活了三十年；濟慈在人間游歷了二十六個春秋；即是愛倫坡，他的吟詠生涯亦僅不過四十載。彭思死的時候，他才初度過三十七歲的生日，這段短短的期間，滿是愁悶和掙扎。</p>
<p>詩人對死，似有預感。雖然他還僅三十七歲的壯年，他已意識到死亡的臨近。在一個冬天的夜晚，他跟往常一樣與伙伴們圍坐在酒店裏，忽然他說；「好友們，我將死了。」朋友都川了奇突惶惑的眼光看着他。</p>
<p>他拖着沉重的脚步，默默地走回家去，但是他並未抵達家門，行至半途，竟眞的接受了死神的邀請。</p>
<h3 id="c155">黃陽司車站　流亡小記 <a href="#c155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>— 石默</p>
<p>列車開進了黃陽司—這個湘桂路上的小站，緩緩的停了下來。這時正是五六月的天氣，太陽像一把高張的火傘。人們懷着焦灼的心情，從車頂上，從車窗裏爬了下來，躦進車底下去，敞開衣服乘凉了。不管是怎樣陌生，大家也彼此殷勤的問訊着，打聽衡陽是否已經失守的消息。</p>
<p>車站是一片喧嚷。我夾在人羣裏面，從攤販的這一端踱到另外）端，尋找一點可以充饥的食物，我的頭被太陽晒得有點暈眩了。我抬頭看那列靜靜的火車，黑黝黝的躺在那裏。人們在他的身上爬下來又爬上去，走過來又走過去。</p>
<p>時候，太陽漸漸的向西方落下，對面的天空，顯得更　遠而美麗了。隱的的傳過來兩聲汽笛以後，那方升起了農家的一縷黑烟，大家抬起疲倦的眼睛望了一望，知道又是一列火車拖着十批難民向黃陽司駛來，心裏想着：「衡陽不知道到底怎麽樣了？</p>
<p>我踱到附近一個小山坡上寂寞的坐下來，看那一列火車，冒着黑烟，漸漸駛進了車站。我們忽然發覺，這一列車駛到我們停車的這一股軌還上來了。大家立時揚起雙臂叫囔起來。人的聲音像　濤怒吼一般，人的手臂像樹林裏迎風搖曳的枝椏，凌亂的揮動，但火車在軋軋的機械聲裏，沉重的駛了過來，沒有給人們一點猶豫的時間，「轟」然一聲，碰在我們的車廂上。</p>
<p>突然一片寂靜，像無邊的大海裏的一個巨浪迎風聲立了起來，然後向岸旁的岩石上猛的砸過去，聯然一聲後的一個極短時間的寂靜，接着嘩然一片水嚮夾着擊落的岩石粉碎的跌落的聲音，人們的哭喊隨之而起了。</p>
<p>在車廂下乘凉的人們，壓斷手的，壓斷腿的，從車廂上震落下來的人，又壓在他們的甚上，有的晕厥過去了，有的已經停止了呼吸。妻子抱着孩子在尋找她的丈夫，她瘋狂的跑過幾個車廂，一眼看見她的丈夫正躺在血泊裏，牠一聲尖叫，像一個巨大的鐵鎚沉重的敲在她的背上，應聲向前倒了下去，壓在死者的胸脯上面，孩子扔在一旁。</p>

<p>民眾藝術</p>
<p>德語爲Volkskunst法語爲Lart　du　Penplle，「民衆藝術」有三：一是從民主主義及社會主義的思想而來，一是厭棄頹廢的中產階級藝術，一是爲了新興民衆。尤其是新興階級所產生的新藝術，主張所謂真的藝術是把民衆的悲歡，欲求，信仰集於個人生活的焦點而燃燒着的。羅曼羅蘭（Romain　Rolland）就是這種主張的代表人物。</p>
<p>拜金藝術</p>
<p>英語爲Mammonart是對於金錢崇拜的意思，爲黃金而藝術的一種傾向。在資本主義的社會組織裏面，一切的東西，藝術也不能例外，無疑地都有成爲商品的可能性。美國文藝理論家辛克萊（Sinclair　Upton）對於這點，有明瞭的解剖，在他那一本很著名的「拜金藝術一的專書中。</p>

<p>糟糕！我關照了〇四號幾句話，便趕着往路局電廠跑去。到了山埂下的路上，見果然是長辛店鎭上的人，背的扛的，都是大包小裏，往廠裏走去。問起來，都一口同音，說是日本鬼子要打過來了，預備在廠裏暫時躱避一下。</p>
<p>「大嫂」我在鼎元門口碰見鼎元的太太，「這是怎麽說？……誰叫這些一人往廠裏搬？……」</p>
<p>「雖也不知道！」她驚詫得很，「鼎元精神好些，還沒躺下，您請屋裏坐。</p>
<p>「這可熱鬧哪！」鼎元確比早上精神好些，「您聽，鬼子的砲火，好像沒花錢買的。」</p>
<p>這時砲火很緊，每次砲彈落下，轟的一聲，廠　裏的窗格門框都震得扎扎的亂響。幾個孩子都坐在屋角，在睜着大眼，豎起了耳根，好像亦知道這砲彈落在什麼地段似的。大姐姐梅君也坐在弟妹們一起，兩隻小手揑得緊緊地。</p>
<p>我吿訴鼎元，廠裏的地位，實在不佳；萬一情形不對，這廠就是一個進攻的目標。况且鎭上的人，都往這裏圍集，尤其不好。</p>
<p>鼎元很鎭定的沉思着；也不知他眞的鎭定，還是裝出來英國紳士風味。</p>
<p>「這也無可奈何」他慢吞吞地說:一廠長不在這裏，鎭上這些人，現廠裏的工頭管事，多少帶着些親戚朋友關係，一個來，就不能不許第二個來，您說是嗎？至於來了之後，究竟有什麼好處，也許沒人說得出。……」</p>
<p>我問他有沒有意思往外挪。他說一實際上怕辦不到；沒有地方去，並且挪去挪來，也挪不出長辛店的圈子，除非馬上到軍隊去投効。希望身體復元，早點去投効。」我看說去說來，說不出一個　體辦法，祗好把談話結束。</p>
<p>梅君送我到門外，緊緊跟在我後而。我叫她不必客氣，回去待候爸爸，照拂弟妹要緊。她祗是默默地跟在後而走着，好像沒有聽見我的話似的。走了幾步，我覺得奇怪，因爲平日她並沒有這一類的舉動。看看快到廠門的大路上，我便停了步，問她可有什麼話要說？</p>
<p>在隴朦的星月光下，她穿着家常的一身淡藍褲褂，倩倩的影子，好像隨着微風飄動，搖拽不定。勻停的一副輪廓，從糢糊的樹林亂枝，和淡薄的月影下，襯托出來，雖很飄忽，却極有風緻。</p>
<p>「伯父！」她的聲音細得不可再細，然很淸析，「您有功夫，…」轟的一聲，又是一個砲彈，在不大遠的方面落下炸裂，她都震動着，廠屋門窗上的玻璃，也隨着砰的一聲回響，把牠的下半句話掩沒</p>
<p>我有功夫，當然要常來看你們的…我揣想她的話因，給她安慰着你……</p>
<p>「我…害怕！」她低下頭，聲音有些哽咽。</p>
<p>「怕什麽…孩子？」我想壯壯她的胆量，但又想到這句話，說得不近情理。她，一個才十七歲的女孩子，陷在這麼一個可怕的環境中，父親又病在床上，一家全是婦女小孩，要說不怕，節直不可能。怕也無益」。我祇好拿不相干的話安慰她，勸她照拂弟弟妹妹，早點上床、答應她明天一早來與她爸爸商量辦法。</p>

<p>冷氣開得太大了，你摸摸我的手看多冷！</p>
<p>一邊說一邊就伸過一隻手來，擺在兪君的手上，因爲兪君並不把她的手推開，她就得寸進尺的把另一隻手也伸了過來，且把身體靠在兪君的身上說：</p>

<p>那女子裝束很入時，看上去很漂亮兪君並未拒絕，讓她靠上，把自己的手當作了熱水袋讓她烘手，及至快散塲時，該女輕聲對他說：</p>

<p>— 何力平</p>
<p>「連環圖畫」間題，早就有人討論過了，她給與兒童甚至成人婦女惡劣的影響，是不用多說的。我最近走民國路看到有一小間鬥面，內面排滿了密密層層的連環圖畫，夜晚電燈雪亮，許多婦孺坐在矮凳上聚精會神的閱覽，宛然是一個小型的圖書館。</p>
<p>正因爲連環圖書內容不外乎淫盜和神怪，所以看的人在不知不覺中裝了一腦袋希奇古怪的東西，而這些希奇古怪的　西在某）個時期會發生作用，（就是中了連環圖畫的毒，）例如過去兒童人山求仙和這次北京路血案的事件，都是中　之後的反應。</p>
<p>但是我們深一層看法，取締連環圖畫遠在抗戰前就有人呼籲過了，爲什麼不能實現呢？倒並不是內政部有什麽准許證，禁止不了；而實實在在因爲牠擁有廣大的讀者，兒童和婦女成爲連環圖畫的愛好者和擁護者。他們雖然智識淺薄，可是同樣需要精神食糧，然而我們的文藝家忘記了他們，艱深歐化的詞句續起來有如天書，不是他們的智議程度所能了解。我並不是擁護現在的連環圖畫，而是說：現在連參圖畫雖要不得，不過一旦取締之後，兒童和婦女的讀物在那裏呢？我們的文藝家應該低下頭來看看這些渴需精神食糧的大量的婦女和兒童，利用連環圖畫的形式把科學常識，抗戰英雄故事，歷史上的名人奮鬥史，……道些嶄新的題材注射進去，使連環圖畫變成指導兒童婦女走向光明大道的敎育課本。</p>
<p>連環圖畫的形式本身無罪，有　的是藉通環圖畫的形式裝進淫盜神怪的內容；我們不妨反過來拿舊瓶裝新酒，以連環圖畫的舊形式裝進科學道德藝術的新內容。這樣更容易把愛着連環圖畫的兒童和婦女爭取過來。爲了救救中連環圖畫毒的婦女和兒意，除了消極的取締外，我更積極的呼籲文化人注意道個問題，動手爲民衆服務，創造有血有肉的新連環圖畫！</p>

<p>王先生是浙江奉化人，與蔣主席是同鄕，幼時兩人就甚爲相契。他生於光緒八年七月二十五日，比蔣主席大五歲。在蔣主席的私扎日記中、時常提起一儒堂一（王氏別號）。主席給將經國，蔣緯國的家信中。也老提起「王家伯伯」。</p>
<p>老革命</p>
<p>王氏參加革命甚早，在東京留學的時候，由國父親自介紹，加入同盟會。嗣後赴美游學，結識了許多革命先烈。宣統三年，得耶魯大學文學碩士歸國，正値武昌起義，便追隨黎黃陂，任湖北都啊府外交副主任。從此從事政治生活，他先後担任的職務，計開：</p>
<p>工商次長兼代總長，參議院副議長，巴黎和會全權代表，外交總長，國務總理，財政總長，關稅會議委員長，中俄會議督辦，隴海鐵路督辦，國民政府外交部長，駐美大便，…………現在還被選爲本市參議員之一。</p>
<p>辯外交</p>
<p>辯外交難，辦弱國外交尤難。王氏就任外交部長，正値日寇發動長華攻勢的時候；萬寳山事件未了，東三省遽被强估。當時的中國外交部眞所謂「忍辱負重」，而外界却甚多不諒之言，王時幾成爲衆矢之的。因此，在民國二十年九月二十八日（距九一八事變後十天），有中央大學學生一千七百餘人，擁入外交部，王氏竟遭了　毆，鬧得全國轟動。</p>
<p>王氏是中國辦理外交的第一人，革命政府正式威立時，十二省代表集合在武昌，在漢口英租界　昌洋行內開會。當時王氏任職湖北都督府，因爲比較與外人熟悉的緣故，便公議請王民辦理外交制憲。外交制憲在中國，還是破天荒的事情，毫無成規可循，只有學美國的樣。據說王氏最初辦外交，很得力於勞倫斯著的「國際公法原理」一書，而這本書還是輾轉從一位美國敎士處借得來的。當時的制憲，也是以美國憲法爲藍本，不料制憲完成，却少了「權利與義務」一章。原來美國獨立吿成後所制定的憲法，正少了這一章，後來補在最後的修正案中。王氏與其他兩位制憲代表—雷奮與馬君武，因是時事務倥偬，不及細擇。亦是一設建話。</p>

<p>[Report from our Nanjing Office, 26th] Chairman Chiang returned to Nanjing by the "Meiling" special plane from 贛 County at 2:10 PM on the 26th. After boarding, the plane was delayed for 20 minutes for temporary mechanical inspection before taking off. Nanjing's weather was affected by a typhoon, with wind and rain all day. The rain was particularly heavy in the afternoon, but those waiting to welcome the Chairman arrived at Ming Palace Airport before 5 PM. Cars were neatly lined up outside the airport, and the Chairman's guards also arrived early to make arrangements. A quarter of an hour before the "Meiling" landed, the rain gradually subsided. At 6:10 PM, the "Meiling" plane descended at low altitude and immediately landed. At 6:18 PM, the engine stopped. Those welcoming the Chairman by the plane included Chief of General Staff Chen Cheng, Commander-in-Chief Zhou Zhirou, Acting Commander-in-Chief Tang Enbo, Acting Commander-in-Chief Gui Yongqing, Commander Zhang Zhen, Director Tang Zong, Director Chen Xizeng, and the Chairman's son Chiang Wei-kuo, all lined up. Chiang Ching-kuo, the Chairman's son, walked ahead as the door opened, followed by Director Yu Jishi, and then the Chairman descended from the plane. The Chairman was in excellent spirits, wearing a dark blue long robe, a black cloak, and black soft leather shoes. He smiled and nodded to those welcoming him. Chief of General Staff Chen and his group stood at attention to pay their respects. The Chairman repeatedly said, "Good." Chief of General Staff Chen first said: "The weather in Nanjing is not good today." The Chairman replied: "Good, very good." As he walked to the car, he saw a group of reporters waiting to greet him. The Chairman paid special attention and paused for a minute, smiling at the reporters and saying, "Thank you!" He then boarded car number 00038, and Chiang Ching-kuo accompanied him out of the airport. The Chairman left the capital in the heat of summer and returned in the autumn rain, as healthy as ever. The period of absence from the capital was two months and twelve days. (He left the capital on July 14th, stayed in 牯 Mountain for 69 days, and inspected Jiangxi for 5 days.)</p>
<p>[Report from Central News Agency, 贛 County, 26th] Chairman Chiang left here by special plane to return to Nanjing today amidst the enthusiastic farewell of the people. At 10:00 AM, the Chairman personally inspected the Commissioner's Office. When he arrived at the County Government, more than a hundred representatives from all sectors, including leading figures and gentry, respectfully presented a "Long Live" banner on behalf of all the people. The Chairman gladly accepted it and gave an impromptu speech, elaborating on the importance of Ganzhou in terms of culture and terrain. He mentioned that the previous construction had already laid a foundation, and he hoped that the people and the local government would continue their efforts to build Jiangxi. The Chairman then inspected the County Party Headquarters and left the city by car. From the County Government to the Gong River, a distance of four miles, the people lined the streets to bid farewell, with firecrackers sounding continuously along the way. The Chairman's car moved slowly, and the old and young alike vied for a glimpse of the Chairman's demeanor. After the Chairman boarded the boat, the people still gathered on the riverbank, watching and cheering endlessly. The Chairman repeatedly raised his hand to thank the people for their enthusiasm and love. After crossing the river, the Chairman, accompanied by Yu Jishi, Chiang Ching-kuo, and Wang Lingji, took a short rest at Tongtian Rock and climbed to admire the scenery. They then had lunch together. At 2:00 PM, they arrived at the airport and took off for Nanjing by "Meiling" special plane at 2:10 PM.</p>
<p>[Report from Central News Agency, Nanchang, 26th] At 3:00 PM today, two planes came from the south. Among them, Chairman's plane "Meiling" flew directly north, and Chairman Wang Lingji of Jiangxi took another plane back here.</p>

<p>[Report from Central News Agency, Nanchang, 26th] Chairman Chiang, accompanied by Wang Lingji and Chiang Ching-kuo, went to Xiannvbu in Qinglong Township, Dayu (Nanan), at 9:00 AM on the 26th to pay respects at the place where Mr. Wang Yangming passed away. Xiannvbu is located on the bank of the Zhang River. Mr. Yangming came to Jiangxi from Guangdong in the seventh year of Jiajing in the Ming Dynasty and died of illness in a boat here, which is now 418 years ago. The Chairman read Yangming's "Instructions for Practical Living" in his childhood and deeply admired his theory of innate knowledge, so he made a special trip to pay respects on the second day of his visit to Jiangxi to express his sincerity and respect. At 3:00 PM, the Chairman's car crossed Xiaomei Pass to Damei 　. Damei Pass is located at the intersection of Jiangxi and Guangdong, on the 　 of Dayu Mountain. The terrain is treacherous. The Chairman climbed up the steps from Guangdong Province and entered Jiangxi Province. He talked to the residents and learned that when the enemy invaded and occupied Damei 　, they cut down plum trees wherever they went. The Chairman then instructed the Dayu County Government to plant more new plum trees to preserve the plum forest, 　 to prevent damage. He then left Da 　 and returned to 　 　 to inspect the Dayu and Nankang County Governments. When the people heard that the Chairman had arrived, they set off firecrackers and cheered enthusiastically, the situation was fervent.</p>
<h3 id="e3">Ambassador Stuart Makes Further Mediation Efforts: Joint Letter to Zhou Enlai Hoping for Early Return to Nanjing. Ambassador Stuart is Scheduled to Visit Chairman Chiang Tomorrow <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>[Report from our Nanjing Office, 26th] The peace talks are still at a standstill on the surface today. Special Envoy Marshall and Ambassador Stuart still hope with great sincerity that the Communist Party will change its insistence and hope that Zhou Enlai will return to Nanjing as soon as possible to jointly promote progress. Special Envoy Marshall and Ambassador Stuart met twice in the morning, presumably to review the talks with the Communist Party in recent days. In the afternoon, Ambassador Stuart went to meet Wang Bingnan again to inquire about the Communist Party's attitude of silence in the past two days. Mr. Marshall met him first, followed by a meeting with Ambassador Stuart, which ended at 4:00 PM. It is reported that Special Envoy Marshall and Ambassador Stuart jointly sent a letter to the Communist Party today, which was personally handed over to Wang Bingnan by Ambassador Stuart, who was instructed to forward it to Zhou Enlai. It is generally believed that this document contains the opinions of Marshall and Stuart on further mediation of the talks. At 7:00 PM, Ambassador Stuart attended a dinner hosted by Soviet Ambassador Petrov. It is reported that Special Envoy Marshall will visit Chairman Chiang on the 28th.</p>
<p>[Report from Reuters, Nanjing, 26th] The political situation, which has been gradually deteriorating for several weeks, may have some opportunities after Chairman Chiang returns to Nanjing. Marshal Marshall has informed the Communist Party of the answers before and after their request to reopen the military three-person group meeting. After exchanging views with the Chairman, he can put forward his suggestions. It is generally believed that the government will now propose a compromise action, which will not cause any losses to the government, either militarily or in terms of land. The victory of the National Army in North China can greatly enhance the government's power in the negotiations. The Communist Party's current action is to adopt a wait-and-see policy. They believe that the next action should be initiated by the government. Some foreigners even expect that after the National Army achieves military victories, the government will follow up with some political concessions to show its spirit of compromise. The government is becoming increasingly concerned about the Communist Party's insistence on its original demands due to the approaching date of the National Assembly. The government hopes that the Communist Party, the Democratic League, and other 　 factions and non-partisan representatives can jointly participate in the National Assembly to formulate a constitution. The Communist Party currently has no intention of participating. Communist Party spokesman Wang Bingnan stated that the Communist Party will formally respond to the government's invitation to the Communist Party to submit a list of National Assembly representatives. The Communist Party firmly stated that it will never attend the National Assembly until the sound of gunfire in the civil war stops. It is said that before the government puts forward conditions that can be accepted by the Communist Party as a basis for negotiations, it should first occupy Zhangjiakou and Harbin, the two major final goals, to give the Communists a lesson. If this statement is true, then the government's military activities will inevitably intensify in the coming days.</p>
<h3 id="e4">The Government's Military Achievements Have a Dual Political Effect: British Newspapers Comment on the Dynamics of Peace in China <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>[Report from our Correspondent in London, 25th] The successive victories of the National Army in North China have gradually attracted the attention of the British press in the past few days. The London Times published an article today entitled "The Dynamics of Peace in China," stating that the Communist Party has repeatedly suffered defeats and is 　 prepared to accept the government's peace proposals based on constitutional reform. The advent of new hope is not entirely due to the efforts of the American 　 people, but at least partly due to the result of recent military developments. The newspaper pointed out that the political effects of the government's military victory are twofold: first, the Communist Party gradually realizes that the hope of establishing an independent region against the government within China is extremely slim; second, the government, having occupied the main areas returned by Japan and withdrawn by the Communist Army, now intends to implement the agreement established in February this year. The newspaper stated: "The two major obstacles to the implementation of this agreement are the Communist Party's desire to occupy areas that were not under the Communist Party 　 when the agreement was established, and the Communist Army's attempts to destroy transportation in order to exclude government troops. Now, after fighting hard, the government has restored the position that Chairman Chiang believes is necessary to resolve the Kuomintang-Communist dispute. Maintaining the normal state of railway communication is a necessary condition for the entire construction work. The Communist Party's destructive policy is deeply resented by the government. Now that the government has exerted its power, it can shake hands with the Communist Party and let the Communist Party follow the constitutional path to achieve its goals. This hope is no longer empty." Regarding the news of the Kuomintang-Communist war, British newspapers only have fragmentary records. The British public is not clear about the actual situation in China. Today's editorial in The Times briefly describes the situation in China, and its argument is fair, unbiased, and constructive. It will undoubtedly enable the British public to better understand the current situation in China.</p>
<h3 id="e5">The CCP Suffers a Devastating Political Failure <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>Deceptive Propaganda is Exposed</p>
<p>[Report from our Xuzhou Office, 26th] The Communist Party is now suffering a devastating political failure. Its long-touted political work has been exposed for what it is when the National Army advances. The people in various places welcome the National Army with genuine feelings. The National Army adopts a lenient policy towards those who have served the Communist Army, without retaliation. Therefore, the local teams of the Communist Army are unwilling to follow when the Communist Army retreats and are vying to reform themselves. In Xiaoxian County alone, there are as many as three thousand people, and the total number is quite considerable. The Communist Army's propaganda of "not leaving the township, not leaving the county" is no longer effective. Wang Gongyu, Director of the Civil Affairs Department of Jiangsu Province, who is here to supervise administrative personnel and coordinate with military affairs, told reporters today that the exposure of the Communist Party's political weaknesses is both a joy and a fear for us. The joy is that the people are no longer deceived, and the fear is how to keep the enthusiasm of the people in the recovered areas lasting for a long time, which requires the greatest effort. Wang said: "The most difficult thing now is the lack of special funds. The newly recovered areas are full of scars and in need of funds everywhere. We have already requested the central government to allocate special funds." He also said that the reformed Communist Army will be given appropriate training. Wang also said: "The people in the north are tough and there is a lot of armed force among the people, which is enough to deal with the Communist Army and is quite helpful to the National Army."</p>

<p>[Report from Central News Agency, Beiping, 26th] The military confirmed this morning the news that the National Army had entered Kangzhuang on the PingSui Line after the Communist Army withdrew. In addition, "part of the Communist Army" in Guyuan, Chahar Province, revolted and established contact with the National Army in Rehe 　. The people in Duolun and other places launched armed uprisings in large numbers, and the Communist Army in the city was shaken.</p>
<p>[Report from our Beiping Office, 26th] The National Army on the border of Hebei and Chahar provinces is still in action, and a formal war does not seem to have broken out yet. However, the relevant authorities hinted to reporters that there may be important news to be released tomorrow, in which case the matter may break out tonight. The Air Force reported today that the Communist Army is building solid fortifications on the Xiahuayuan line. More than 300 Communist Army artillery pieces were found in Sangyuan 　 and are active. Senior officials estimate that the battle of Zhangjiakou can be expected to end two weeks after it breaks out. The staff of the Zhangjiakou United Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, Miss Bi Bi 　 Da, Mr. Walut, Mr. Silin, and Mr. Fu Qingling and Mr. Zhang Sunzhen of the Chinese National Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, returned to Beiping by the Executive Headquarters' plane yesterday. According to them, the order in Zhangjiakou is gradually becoming chaotic. The sound of explosions can be heard at any time, all caused by the Communist Army destroying buildings.</p>
<p>[Report from our Beiping Office, 26th] A certain military expert said: "The fate of Zhangjiakou will be determined by the battle of Huailai. The terrain of Huailai is extremely dangerous, and after passing Huailai, there is no danger to defend until Zhangjiakou." It is said that Zhu De clearly declared at a military conference in Zhangjiakou that Huailai must be defended to the death, and no retreat is allowed without orders.</p>
<p>[Report from our Beiping Office, 26th] People from Zhangjiakou say that Zhangjiakou has completely lost its peace. Gunshots can be heard day and night in the suburbs. Military facilities can be seen everywhere. Most of the young people have been incorporated into the Communist Army, and women are forced to join the Women's Federation to engage in auxiliary military work. The old and young are evacuated to the countryside. Except for the necessary military factories, all other factories have completely shut down. Machinery and materials are mostly transported to Yuxian 　 and Yuanyuan. Because materials and food are being requisitioned, prices are soaring and cannot be suppressed. The Zhangjiakou power supply was originally in Xiahuayuan under Beiping Tuoluo, but the two 25,000-kilowatt generators and one 10,000-kilowatt generator in that place have been dismantled and the facilities have been bombed. Currently, there is only a small generator in Zhangjiakou city for military purposes. The four-unit high-speed rotary press used by the "Jin-Cha-Ji Daily" left behind by the Japanese has been destroyed 　 due to its weight. The newspaper stopped printing in Zhang on the 17th. Chen Jinmin, a former professor at Chaoyang University who recently joined the Communist Party, has been appointed as the chief writer of the newspaper. Currently, the train to Zhangdong runs to Huailai, and the Da 　 Bridge to the east has been destroyed twice. The train travels at night, and the farmers within 15 kilometers of the railway, those aged 15 to 50, are forced to 　 go to designated locations to gather.</p>

<p>A Statement by the Person in Charge of the Beiping Provisional Headquarters</p>
<p>[Report from Central News Agency, Beiping, 26th] According to the person in charge of the Beiping Provisional Headquarters, the principle for handling land in the newly recovered areas is that the original owners retain the property rights of land that has been subject to struggle and liquidation, but they may not immediately take it back. The current users will continue to use it as tenants, and the land tax will be shared by the landlord and the tenant. The rent paid by the tenant to the owner will only be implemented after the detailed rules for the restoration of land ownership have been approved. The Provisional Headquarters will follow this principle in all the newly recovered areas under its jurisdiction. Regarding the border currency issue, a laissez-faire attitude is being adopted for the time being. The National Army in the Jidong area uses legal currency, and the people use border currency among themselves. It has not been explicitly prohibited and there are no disputes. However, in order to reduce the burden on the people, instructions have been requested from the central government to prepare a solution.</p>

<p>[Report from our Nanjing Office, 26th] An economic expert said: "There are many signs that the prospect of commodity prices is optimistic recently. In Nanjing, Shanghai, and other places, the fluctuations of some commodities due to the rise of the US dollar lack a basis and it is believed that they will fall back soon." He cited three reasons for optimism: "(1) The fiscal situation this year is very good. Last year, only 15% of the national income relied on tax revenue, and the rest relied almost entirely on the issuance of banknotes. The situation has completely changed this year. Tax revenue can account for 60% of the total income. At the same time, the income from the auction of enemy property is also large, and the fiscal future is very optimistic; (2) There is a general good harvest this year, and grain prices are stable in various places, which will be of great benefit to suppressing commodity prices; (3) Transportation in various places has gradually recovered, and transportation is becoming more convenient day by day. The abnormal phenomena caused by the imbalance between supply and demand in the past are no longer serious."</p>

<h3 id="e21">Northeast Limits Cotton Exports; Wang Nianzu Discusses Commodity Adjustment Issues: Using Barter to Exchange Goods <a href="#e21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Shenyang, This Newspaper, 25th] The issue of adjusting the inflow and outflow of commodities in the Northeast is currently receiving great attention from all parties. Yesterday, according to Deputy Director Wang Nianzu of the Commercial Affairs Department of the Northeast Xing Yuan Economic Commission, the "Provisional Measures for Adjusting the Inflow and Outflow of Commodities" had been promulgated earlier regarding the restrictions and incentives for commodity inflow and outflow. However, there have been slight changes since then, mainly concerning exports such as pig bristles and horse tails. The method of issuing permits for export had been adopted, but later, considering that there was no need to adopt a permit system for these materials in the Northeast, it has now been lifted. Export is allowed freely without restrictions. As for cotton and cottonseed, a permit system had been adopted, allowing their export. However, in recent months, the price inside the customs area has been higher than in the Northeast, and there has been a phenomenon of continuous outflow. Considering the current situation in the Northeast, cotton and cotton cloth are extremely scarce. Not only do the people feel a shortage of necessities, but also the supply of cotton raw materials for the textile factories that are about to start operation is becoming a problem. Therefore, the regulations have also been changed, and all exports are absolutely restricted. Regarding export incentives, in addition to exempting all export goods from taxes, the Central Trust Bureau has previously signed a contract with the United Kingdom to sell 10,000 tons of soybeans exported from the Northeast, which it has completed the purchase of, and may soon be transported to the UK via Huludao and Shanghai. In addition, it is planned to export soybeans to the United States, and negotiations are underway. Secondly, regarding the issue of export ports, currently, export goods must pass through Huludao and then to Shanghai before they can be exported. However, because the conditions of Huludao Port are currently insufficient and the warehouse facilities are inadequate, the government plans to convert the port into a direct export port without going through Shanghai. Therefore, it is necessary to build more warehouses. It is expected that this will be of great benefit to promoting exports in the future. In order to connect the materials between various regions of the country, so as to stabilize prices and ensure the livelihood of the people, it is planned to exchange miscellaneous grains produced in the Northeast with flour and cotton cloth produced in Shanghai and Tianjin, which is also one of the important policies recently. Also, at present, the factories in the Northeast have not officially resumed production, and the products are too few to meet the urgent needs of the people. Therefore, there is no phenomenon of foreign goods flooding the market and affecting industrial development. There is no such hidden worry for the time being. Once there is a sign of the above situation, restrictions can be imposed in accordance with the industrial and commercial remittance restriction methods. The so-called industrial and commercial remittance method is that the current import and export merchants who want to order foreign goods must have their remittances to foreign countries reviewed and approved by the Four Banks Joint Office before they can remit the money. If the government believes that the continuous import of a certain type of goods will affect the development of a certain industry in the Northeast, then the industrial and commercial remittances for purchasing that foreign goods will be restricted, and the above phenomenon can be avoided.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] Regarding the problem of supplementing electricity in the Northeast, the authorities stated that they will do their best to solve the difficulties. The current electricity is 190,000 kilowatts, which is sufficient for application. Xiaofengman sends electricity to Shenyang, which has reached 45,000 kilowatts. The current distribution situation is: Shenyang 20,000 kilowatts, Yingkou 2,000 kilowatts, Anshan 2,000 kilowatts, Jinzhou (including Fuxin) 5,000 kilowatts, Fushun 15,000 kilowatts, and Liaoyang 1,000 kilowatts.</p>

<p>[United Press, Washington, 25th] President Truman submitted the eighth report to Congress on the work of UNRRA for the second quarter of 1946, stating that the total amount of relief supplies shipped to China in May reached 446,057 tons, and since the beginning, a total of 2,104,210 tons have been transported. The President said: "Since the beginning, the transportation plan has been one of the biggest obstacles," saying that due to the lack of transportation, food could not be transported to the famine areas behind the coastal cities, and the necessary equipment for rebuilding roads, bridges and railways was piled up on the docks. This situation has gradually improved in the past three months, and food supplies have been able to be transported to the interior of China in large quantities. The President said that the recent report from the China branch showed that "food is now being rapidly transported to disaster areas." He also said that UNRRA's medical program "has achieved considerable success in China."</p>

<h3 id="e32">Fierce Fighting Among Lolo Tribes; Investigation Team Ventures Out; U.S. Senator Cables President Insisting on Rescuing Pilots <a href="#e32" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c32" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">32</a></h3>
<p>[United Press, Chengdu, 25th] After the discovery of missing American pilots forced into hard labor in the Lolo tribe area bordering Tibet and Burma, the U.S. military authorities are preparing to investigate the truth. However, news from the border has revealed that the Lolo tribes are engaged in fierce fighting in an area of 200 miles along the Tibetan border, threatening the investigation work. However, the search team led by U.S. Army Lieutenant Colonel Han Qiqin, disregarding everything, set off according to the scheduled plan, accompanied by French tea planter who is familiar with the situation of the Lolo tribes, aboard the military aircraft "Question Mark" from Xichang. Fights among the Lolo tribes are common, but it is reported that the recent battles are exceptionally fierce. The weapons they use are no longer the spears and leather shields of the past, but modern firearms, including automatic weapons, which the tribe stole or purchased during the war. Their equipment is also very sophisticated. According to an official here, the early search team was warned by the natives that it must enter its territory peacefully and be prepared to redeem the captives at a price, otherwise the search team would be ambushed and killed. The reason why the search team is proceeding cautiously and contacting through intermediaries is because of this. The main task of Lieutenant Colonel Han and his party is to safely rescue the captives. If force is used, it will be of no avail.</p>
<p>[United Press, Tacoma, Washington, 25th] After it was reported that missing American pilots were forced into hard labor in the Lolo tribe area in western China, the U.S. military authorities are trying to rescue them. Some officers have said that rescuing these pilots will be costly. Washington State Democratic Senator Kefei expressed dissatisfaction upon hearing the news and sent a cable to President Truman, protesting, stating: "No one complains about the cost of rescue being expensive. I firmly advocate that you immediately order the dispatch of an expeditionary force from the U.S. military base in Chongqing to the Lolo area in western Sichuan, and publicly announce that rescuing all Americans enslaved in remote areas is the determination of the United States."</p>

<h3 id="e36">Editorial: Who is Sitting Back and Watching Prices Soar? <a href="#e36" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c36" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">36</a></h3>
<p>Generally, when there is inflation, prices will inevitably rise; when prices rise, they often stimulate industry and commerce, taking advantage of the opportunity to prosper, which can achieve a temporary boom. Therefore, the high price policy itself can be said to be half beneficial and half harmful, as long as it is used properly, and at the right time, it may not be a bad method.</p>
<p>However, when this example is applied to our country, it seems to have gone awry. Isn't there a high price problem now? The result is:</p>
<p>(1) Many factories reduce work hours or close down. The entire industry in Shanghai, and even the entire country, is showing a risk of total collapse;</p>
<p>(2) Unemployment increases, and society is uneasy;</p>
<p>(3) Exports are sluggish, but foreign goods are still selling well. The trend of smuggling is rampant. Customs officers and police are almost at a loss, or may even be taking advantage of the situation;</p>
<p>(4) Ordinary people feel that life is difficult, and demand salary increases and improved treatment, which indirectly promotes inflation and rising prices;</p>
<p>(5) There is a surplus of floating capital, which has created various speculations and abnormal transactions;</p>
<p>(6) Legitimate industries and businesses cannot withstand the pressure of high interest rates and are eking out a meager existence under a facade.</p>
<p>According to this, it seems that today's high prices only show their harm, and do not show their benefits. Whether from the perspective of national economy or from the perspective of people's livelihood, there is a need to quickly suppress them. At the last meeting before the Shanghai Municipal Council adjourned, it unanimously passed an emergency motion, requesting the government authorities to quickly curb the rise in prices. This is indeed the urgent cry of the people!</p>
<p>But unfortunately, the facts in front of us are just the opposite. Despite the unanimous call to suppress prices and stabilize prices, the rise in prices has become even more intensified and rampant. In the past few days, it has become insanely out of control! After the Mid-Autumn Festival, the general prices in Shanghai have risen by at least 20%, usually by 30% to 40%, and even by 100% to 200%. This phenomenon undoubtedly increases the difficulty of exporting goods, expands the sales of imported goods, fuels the arrogance of smuggling, and deepens the oppression of general life. Some hope when adjusting foreign exchange before has now become a fantasy! At this time, if we continue to muddle along and do not take thorough and effective measures, social order and the national economy will inevitably suffer a serious blow. This is by no means alarmist talk, but clearly an imminent reality.</p>
<p>Perhaps it is said that suppressing prices is something that everyone wants, and everyone thinks alike. The difficulty lies in not having appropriate methods. This seems right, but it is not entirely true. In order for any method to have its full effect, it must first have the determination to thoroughly implement it, and it must not be mixed with other effects or calculations. Take rice as an example: since the adjustment of foreign exchange, general prices have risen, but the price of gold, until recently, was almost the same as before. The reason is very simple, is that the quantity sold is relatively large and the price of the sale does not allow a step-by-step increase.</p>
<p>If we talk about suppression on one hand, but race against the black market on the other hand, and only allow prices to rise but not fall: once the price is raised, it never turns back, will this method be effective in suppressing prices? Clear-headed people will naturally know.</p>
<p>Also, the amount of materials sold is too small, and the actual need is far from enough. Although the production is limited and cannot be fully accepted, the results of the allocation sometimes have surpluses, which are rolled into the next period. This allocation obviously makes the people in need feel apprehensive, and they grab the goods as soon as they see them, and it also allows general merchants to spot the opportunity and hoard for speculation. Does this method have a counter-stimulating effect on suppressing prices? Clear-headed people will be able to distinguish it even more.</p>
<p>Although it is said to crack down on unscrupulous merchants, crack down on hoarding, and crack down on speculation, we have never been able to come up with specific crackdown methods. Even if there are specific methods, we have never been willing to implement them seriously, giving them a real blow. Don't you see that materials such as yarn, cloth, and sugar are flying all over the streets in the black market every day? What effect does this method have on suppressing prices? It is not even worth mentioning.</p>
<p>There are also many similar controlled institutions. They themselves do not have sufficient materials to supply as much as possible, but they do not allow or restrict merchants to freely transport and sell to each other. They only control the limited materials and implement selfish monopolies, openly competing with merchants for profits. Therefore, the higher the price, the thicker their profits are. Coal is the most obvious example. But does this method not run counter to suppressing prices?</p>
<p>There are many reasons for rising prices, and some of them are at least due to the mismanagement of personnel, which should be thoroughly rectified and improved, directly reducing its cost, which indirectly reduces its selling price. For example, the loss of theft of goods during transportation, the unreasonable unloading fees, the pressure of high interest rates, and excessive taxes, etc., are all well-known things. If these burdens are not reduced or exempted separately, and we only talk about suppressing prices, will this method have good results in suppressing prices? It is not necessary to say more to clarify.</p>
<p>In short, it is not that there is no way to suppress prices, but that we have the methods but are unwilling to implement them. It is also not that we have methods but do not implement them, but that we implement them too incompletely. If there are other calculations, and we are unwilling to sacrifice, or we still want to skim some profits from high prices, exaggerating achievements, and only do some painless and perfunctory work to embellish, then it is no different from adding fuel to the fire, and at best, it can only be used to comfort ourselves!</p>
<p>Therefore, those who sit back and watch prices soar today and are helpless should know that they have a responsibility to the country and the people.</p>
<h3 id="e37">Unreliability of Propaganda Offensives <a href="#e37" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c37" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">37</a></h3>
<p>Since the negotiations between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party have stalled, the wars in various places have been expanding day by day. The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has launched all kinds of propaganda offensives to make people's heads spin. Its purpose is to make everyone believe that there is no hope of saving the situation in China. When Minister Peng of the Central Propaganda Department hosted foreign reporters in Beijing the day before yesterday, a foreign newspaper reporter asked, "Is there no hope for the overall situation in China?" This is because foreigners who do not understand the situation in China have been poisoned by the propaganda offensive of the Communist Party, that is why they have this question.</p>
<p>After Japan surrendered, the CCP made a fatal mistake. Because it occupied a favorable military position at the time, it was superstitious about the omnipotence of force, that is, it raised troops to create chaos. Today, when we recall the posture of the CCP at that time, how majestic it was! Although the government tried its best to seek peace, the key to peace or war was entirely in the hands of the CCP. Today, an agreement is signed, and tomorrow it will be completely destroyed. And the mediators sent by the Central Government and friendly countries still respect the opinions and claims of the CCP. Unexpectedly, unprincipled tolerance is tantamount to condoning the CCP's absurd actions, making the CCP's arrogance even more rampant. When the CCP is in a favorable military situation, it uses force to create chaos, fighting for cities and territories. Once it is at a disadvantage, it chants for an unconditional ceasefire, attempting to use the ceasefire time to gain a chance to breathe, so that it can prepare its troops and launch another offensive. Therefore, now the CCP is asking to convene the Three-Person Small Correction Committee, and also asking the government to guarantee a ceasefire order, etc. Almost no one dares to believe that this is the path to achieving peace. The propaganda offensive of the CCP can no longer deceive people.</p>
<p>Although the military development in the past three months has shattered the CCP's dream of relying on force to solve the problem, the CCP is still hovering on a wrong path, and there is no sign of a major epiphany. Suiyuan, Chairman Fu Zuoyi sent a telegram to CCP leader Mao Zedong, earnestly persuading the CCP to lay down its arms, join the government, and promote constitutional government, but how the CCP reacted is still unknown. We believe that the CCP will never lay down its butcher knife until it has reached the end of its rope.</p>
<p>The government has decided to convene the National Assembly as scheduled on November 12, and will order the convocation on October 2. The election office has also issued notices to various parties, requesting them to submit a list of representatives before October 10. If the CCP can abandon the illusion of solving the problem by force and change to the path of political settlement, then this is an excellent opportunity. However, according to CCP spokesperson Liao Chengzhi, "The CCP has a consistent position on the National Assembly issue. Since the government does not stop the war and does not act in accordance with the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference, we should reserve the right to act freely and will never be bound by this kind of National Assembly." At the same time, another CCP spokesperson, Wang Bingnan, threatened the government by convening a "Liberated Area" People's Congress by the CCP. This is enough to prove that the CCP does not want real democracy, but only wants to use this beautiful name to deceive the public and divide China.</p>
<p>Although the CCP can in fact become the second largest party in China, Minister Peng of the Central Propaganda Department also used this as a statement, but any political party, if it cannot think about the welfare of the people, if it cannot fight for the future of the country, how can it have a bright future? Therefore, even if the CCP is only considering its own future, it should have a major epiphany and change its propaganda offensive. "Those who commit many injustices will destroy themselves." The competition between political parties cannot escape this law either. What is the use of propaganda that specializes in psychological warfare?</p>
<h3 id="e38">Review of Policies Supporting Defeated Nations <a href="#e38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>How to handle defeated nations? This seems to be a contentious issue among the victorious nations, particularly concerning Germany, the ringleader in Europe.</p>
<p>Recently, Churchill gave a speech at the University of Zurich in Switzerland, advocating for Franco-German cooperation. He believes that without a great Germany, Europe cannot be revived. Byrnes, in a speech in Berlin, expressed hope that Germany could be self-sufficient without the support of the United Nations, because if Germany cannot recover, the recovery of Europe, especially that of countries neighboring Germany, will be delayed. Germany's current position is important, and politicians around the world are paying close attention. In terms of both words and actions, the United Kingdom and the United States are working to promote its recovery. This is already a clear fact.</p>
<p>Germany was the ringleader in this war, and its militarism and the arrogance of its perceived racial superiority have been deeply ingrained in the hearts of its people since the time of Prussia, and were not merely the incitement of Hitler and a few Nazis. Its people are highly organized, extremely patriotic, and possess high levels of scientific knowledge. If the United Nations gives them a chance to recover, they can easily work hard and become a strong European power in a very short period of time.</p>
<p>The speeches by Churchill and Byrnes, and the recent economic policies of the UK and US in their occupied zones of Germany, have caused particular concern for the Soviet Union and France. The Soviet Union fears that a revived Germany will raise the banner of anti-communism and aggression against the USSR. France fears that Germany will rearm and once again sweep across Europe. These two countries, one in the east and one in the west, have the closest relationship with Germany. It is natural for them to be wary of Germany in every way, and there is nothing to be surprised about.</p>
<p>But why are the UK and US not afraid of Germany, but instead working to support its recovery? Firstly, because of the economic burden. To occupy Germany, the United States must spend vast sums of money, not only to support its own troops, but also to relieve the starving people. The United Kingdom already feels it does not have enough food for its own people and still maintains a rationing system to this day. However, the people in the occupied zones of Germany cannot be allowed to starve. The result is that it must borrow money from the United States to transport food for relief. The heavy burden still falls on the shoulders of the United States. The United Kingdom cannot bear it, and the United States cannot bear it even more!</p>
<p>Another reason is the threat from the Soviet Union. Since the end of this war, Soviet leaders have feared the United States more than they feared Nazi Germany. In particular, on February 9th of this year, Stalin personally announced that another war was inevitable, and his meaning was, of course, directed at someone. From that day on, the Soviet Union expanded its military internally, developing all industries and resources related to military affairs. Research on the atomic bomb was being pursued diligently under the direction of Beria. The production of gasoline, which the Soviet Union itself proclaimed to be the highest in the world at the 1937 Moscow International Geological Congress, has now shifted to promoting a scarcity of oil and competing with the UK and US in Iran. Externally, it is engaged in overt and covert struggles everywhere, establishing puppet governments, and provoking internal conflicts in order to expand its zone of security. Its massive military presence in Germany, Austria, and Eastern Europe has also been slow to withdraw. Supporting Yugoslavia's bid for Trieste and threatening Turkey to jointly manage the Dardanelles Strait further demonstrate its ambitions. In addition, in Greece, Korea, Japan, and even India, it is in direct or indirect conflict with the UK and US everywhere. Although Marshal Stalin recently announced that "there is no danger of war at present," the Soviet Union's actual actions seem to be preparing for war.</p>
<p>Fear of the Soviet Union and preparation for struggle have thus aroused fear in the UK and US, and preparation for defense. But to defend against the Soviet Union, the relationship with other places is small, and the relationship with Germany is large. Germany is located in the center of the European continent, and its people are highly capable. It is a natural barrier for the West and the most appropriate buffer between the two major powers. The Soviet Union saw this point early on, so in the early days of its occupation, it did far more to win over the people than the UK, US, and France. Now the UK and US also feel the importance of Germany and are trying to win it over. The speeches by Byrnes and Churchill are expressions of appeasement toward the German people. Germany, as a defeated nation, is worthy of being appeased by several victorious nations. This shows that a country and a nation must still rely on their own efforts to make themselves successful and capable.</p>
<p>The most distressed party in all of this is France. On the one hand, it fears the Soviet Union, and on the other hand, it fears Germany. It is unwilling to cooperate thoroughly with the UK and US to support Germany, but it also dares not abandon its relationship with the UK and US, which would contribute to the westward expansion of Soviet power. Moreover, the Bidault government, under the leadership of de Gaulle, is gradually being opposed by the French people, and there may even be a danger of collapse.</p>
<p>There is a Chinese saying: "When the snipe and the clam grapple, the fisherman benefits." The fear and struggle between the Soviet Union and the UK and US are no different from the snipe and the clam grappling, and Germany is now being valued, and is reaping the benefits of the fisherman. But not only Germany, isn't Italy also receiving support from the US in the peace conference? Isn't General MacArthur also using all his strength to revive Japan? Even MacArthur's advisors are scolding our country's authorities for the sake of Japan's silk industry? Even the remnants of fascism, Franco in Spain, are safely maintaining their power. If things continue like this, it is uncertain whether one day the defeated nations will raise their heads and engage in aggression again!</p>
<p>We seriously doubt the wisdom of the current policy of the UK and US to support the instigators of war. We doubt even more the wisdom of the Soviet Union's inability to cooperate, which has led to the UK and US adopting this policy of supporting the ringleaders. Today, the key to world peace lies in the cooperation of the five great powers, especially in the sincere cooperation between the US and the Soviet Union. If they do not cooperate, the world situation will only get worse. It will not be difficult for Germany, Italy, and Japan to reorganize their forces. The Soviet Union has many enemies and will be even more difficult to deal with. Will the United States' use of these aggressive nations in the future repeat the mistakes of the pre-war British "balance of power" policy, leading to an uncontrollable situation? For the sake of the self-interests of the US and the Soviet Union, and for the sake of world peace, it is still better to be candid and cooperate, and to promote the full cooperation of the world's five powers, and even strengthen the UN's capabilities and prestige, in order to maintain world peace and prevent aggressive nations from being revived, and humanity from suffering another unprecedented catastrophe.</p>

<p>On September 8th, your newspaper published news of the working review meeting of this office, which included Director Jiang's announcement that "in order to avoid the grain that this office has worked hard to transport to various places being requisitioned by the Grain Department, and the Grain Department having to find ways to transport it out after receiving it, causing double damage, it is negotiating with the Grain Department for exchange methods." After investigation, this office and the Ministry of Food have exchanged grain allocated by the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) to this office with grain from the Ministry of Food in the past, to avoid transportation back and forth and to save transportation costs and means.

<h3 id="e45">Seize the Opportunity to Mend the Rift: UK and US Hope for Consistency Between Words and Actions from the Soviet Union; British Cabinet Meeting Discusses Foreign Policy <a href="#e45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 25th] Authoritative figures in the UK and US stated today that unless the Soviet Union is consistent between its words and actions, Stalin's recently released statements of conciliation will not have any significant impact on the diplomatic conflict between the Eastern and Western blocs. US Secretary of State Byrnes shows no sign of considering changing his current firm policy. The US side is convinced that unless the Soviet Union takes some conciliatory action in the peace conference or the upcoming Four Power Conference, Byrnes will not be moved by Stalin's statements about cooperation with Western democracies. Regarding the point that neither side wants war, the UK and US are in complete agreement with Stalin's view. The concern is that one side may misunderstand the situation and allow some incidents to escalate into war.</p>
<p>[Our Report] London dispatch, 26th: Marshal Montgomery went to Downing Street today to attend a cabinet meeting. The Prime Minister's residence was crowded with tourists. Prime Minister Bevin also participated in the meeting. It is believed that the discussion included many issues related to foreign policy, and Stalin's statement was very likely to be brought up for discussion first.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Stratford, UK, 25th] Former Foreign Secretary Eden stated in his constituency today that Marshal Stalin's remarks offer a new opportunity for the country's foreign policy, which we all welcome. He firmly believes that the Soviet Union and the Western diplomatic community will seize this opportunity. Although there are many difficulties ahead, they can be overcome if they are persistent and sincere.</p>
<h3 id="e46">London Evening Standard Reports: Truman and Stalin May Meet <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 25th] The London Evening Standard's New York correspondent, Webbley, recently telegraphed that President Truman's advisors are currently trying to arrange a meeting between President Truman and Marshal Stalin, so that the rift between the Soviet Union and Western democracies can be mended. Since the Potsdam Conference, the Soviet Union and Western democracies have parted ways. President's advisors generally believe that the conversation between Marshal Stalin and Walter, a reporter from the Times of London stationed in Moscow, sufficiently demonstrates that the time for a meeting between President Truman and Marshal Stalin is ripe and can strengthen the position of the Democratic Party in the country. Since the former Secretary of Commerce Wallace was ordered to resign, the position of the Democratic Party has been greatly weakened. President Truman himself also believes that it is meaningless for the Four Power Foreign Ministers Conference to meet frequently, and it should be replaced by a Three Great Powers Conference to discuss various long-standing issues.</p>

<p>[Our Report] Paris dispatch, 26th: The Paris Peace Conference suddenly advanced its plenary session to 5:30 PM today. This move is largely related to the lack of consensus on the approval of the treaty with Finland.</p>
<p>[Our Report] Paris dispatch, 26th: Due to Stalin's recent conciliatory remarks, representatives from various countries at the peace conference are waiting quietly for signs of a compromise attitude from the Soviet representatives on the Trieste dispute. However, today the Soviet representative Vyshinsky again launched a major attack on the United States, accusing the United States of deliberately obstructing the resolution of various economic issues in the Balkans, especially the reparations issue in Romania.</p>
<p>[Our Report] Paris dispatch, 26th: Vyshinsky reviewed the Romanian reparations issue in the Balkan Committee today, emphasizing the importance of Romania's participation in the Allied war effort in 1944. He reiterated the Soviet Union's position on this issue, saying that the reparations we are asking Romania to pay are only one-fifth of the total losses caused by the Romanian army's destruction and looting in southwestern Soviet territory. We believe that the Allied demands for full reparations are unfair. Vyshinsky said that Romania is scarred by war, mostly due to Allied bombing, so Romania cannot bear full responsibility, nor can it fully bear the consequences. For this reason, the Soviet delegation believes that full reparations are far from just and equitable. This issue was not resolved today and has been decided to be discussed again at a later date.</p>
<h3 id="e48">Little Progress in the Work of Various Committees <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 25th] The decision made by the Four Power Foreign Ministers yesterday to take measures to accelerate the work of the peace conference has not had any effect in the various committees of the peace conference. The Committee on Economic Issues with Italy, the Committee on Political and Territorial Issues with Italy, and the Trieste Subcommittee have all met for a long time, but have produced little result. The meeting situation of the various committees is as follows:</p>
<p>Regarding the Issue of Property Compensation in Italy</p>
<p>(1) The Committee on Economic Issues with Italy met this afternoon to discuss the issue of whether all or part of the property owned by citizens of the Allied countries in Italy should be compensated by Italy. After debate, a vote was taken, and nine votes were in favor of partial compensation, and nine votes were in favor of full compensation. The committee then discussed the amendment proposed by the Yugoslav representative, advocating the adoption of a percentage-based compensation method. This principle was ultimately rejected by the committee with fourteen votes. The committee finally passed the French delegation's proposal, deciding that the compensation amount would be 75 percent. At this point, the Soviet representative stood up and spoke, demanding that the French delegation's proposal must be passed by a two-thirds majority. However, the committee adjourned without discussion.</p>
<p>Deadline for Withdrawal of Allied Forces from Hungary</p>
<p>(2) The Committee on Political and Territorial Issues with Italy made very slow progress today, discussing the clause in the treaty with Hungary stipulating that all Allied forces should withdraw within ninety days after the signing of the treaty. Later, the representatives of Australia and Czechoslovakia voluntarily withdrew their amendments, and the committee then passed it. Regarding the suggestion proposed by the UK and US that disputes arising from the implementation of the treaty should be resolved by the International Court of Justice, it was passed only after lengthy discussion. The Soviet Union's proposed amendment, advocating direct negotiations in such circumstances, was rejected by the committee. In addition, the committee also passed Article 34 of the treaty with Hungary, stipulating that within eighteen months after the signing of the treaty, the heads of the diplomatic missions of the UK, US, and Soviet Union will represent the Allied countries in handling all issues related to the implementation of the treaty. (3) The Trieste Issue Subcommittee made no progress again today, and it is almost certain that it will not be able to complete its work in the short term.</p>
<h3 id="e49">Soviet Union Originally Intended to Join the Tripartite Pact, Revealed in Evidence Submitted to the International Court of Justice <a href="#e49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>Stalin Told Matsuoka that He Would Not Be Friendly with Britain</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Tokyo, 26th] According to evidence presented during the war crimes trials today, the Soviet Union originally intended to join the Tripartite Pact, but the plan fell through because Germany could not meet Stalin's conditions. This was revealed in the records of the meeting between German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop and the late Japanese Foreign Minister Yosuke Matsuoka in Berlin on March 28, 1941. The document proves that Ribbentrop secretly told Matsuoka that after the breakdown of German-Soviet negotiations, Germany could deal with the Soviet Union slowly, but Ribbentrop pointed out that Hitler was quite unhappy with Stalin's attitude, and if Stalin did anything to offend him again, he was determined to "destroy the Soviet Union."</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Tokyo, 26th] According to evidence presented during the war crimes trials today, in the spring of 1940, Stalin told the then Foreign Minister Yosuke Matsuoka that the Soviet Union had never been friendly with Britain in the past, and would not be friendly with Britain in the future. Matsuoka, before his death in June, was one of the defendants awaiting trial. When he discussed with Hitler on March 27, 1941, the plan for Japan to attack Singapore as part of Japan's assistance to Germany, he immediately reported Stalin's views to Hitler.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Tokyo, 26th] The Far East International Tribunal today read the memorandum of former German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop, which recorded Ribbentrop's meeting with the then Japanese Ambassador to Germany, Hiroshi Oshima, on February 23, 1941, informing him of Germany's war plan, which briefly stated: Germany has won militarily, politically, and economically, but wants to end the war quickly. If Singapore is occupied in a blitzkrieg, it will force Britain to sue for peace. Oshima assured him of the preparation for the occupation of Singapore, and said that Japan had difficulty supplying steel, so it would not build 45,000-ton battleships, but would convert submarines, torpedo boats, and speedboats to defend its homeland. Singapore must be attacked by land, as a naval offensive would be more difficult. Oshima also mentioned plans to attack Hong Kong and the Philippines, but Ribbentrop urged him to put this plan aside, saying that it was enough to attack Singapore, and that the United States had not yet armed itself and did not dare to send its "iron catfish" west of Hawaii.</p>

<p>Compensation Issues Being Studied</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 26th] Japanese newspapers raised an issue today, namely, after the Tokyo Tribunal sentences Japanese war criminals to death, should Japanese insurance companies compensate their families with insurance benefits, because some of the major war criminals have life insurance policies. Insurance companies will study this issue separately. However, the assets of each war criminal are currently under the custody of the Special Industry Management Bureau of the Ministry of Finance, so if the company compensates, it will pay it to the bureau for safekeeping instead of directly paying it to their families.</p>

<p>[Agence France-Presse, Rome, 25th] The Italian Foreign Ministry issued a communiqué today stating: "The Committee on Political and Territorial Issues with Italy of the Paris Peace Conference met on the 24th of this month and passed Articles 18, 19, and 20 of the draft peace treaty with Italy, namely the three articles concerning Italy's renunciation of extraterritorial rights and concessions in China. Since Italy was forced by circumstances to not be able to directly discuss this issue with China, the Italian government has repeatedly informed the Chinese government of its readiness to renounce all privileges and interests stipulated in the 1901 Treaty of Peking and its appendices. Therefore, Italy is happy to accept the provision in the treaty to renounce this privilege, so as to conform to the policy of the current Italian government to rebuild Sino-Italian friendship."</p>

<p>[Our Report] San Francisco dispatch, 26th: British government officials revealed today that the existence of a state of civil war in Greece makes the withdrawal of British troops impossible.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Athens, 25th] Greek Prime Minister Tsaldaris hosted foreign reporters today and issued a written statement accusing foreign forces of disrupting Greece. It briefly stated: It is clear that the war has shifted from abroad to Greece in order to achieve its goal of taking advantage of the chaotic situation to obtain an outlet to the Aegean Sea. Foreign forces have used their veto power in the UN Security Council to prevent the organization of an international fact-finding mission to inspect the Greek border. At the same time, a spokesman for the Greek Embassy in London also stated that the fierce fighting in the mountainous areas of northern Greece was caused by saboteurs who had infiltrated from Albania and Yugoslavia, with the tacit consent of the governments of those countries. Tsaldaris said in a speech to the public in Thessaloniki that the disturbances in northern Greece are actually a war against the country, and the government will resist at any cost.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 25th] The activities of guerrillas in northern Greece have greatly increased in the past week. The Greek government has not yet asked the British troops stationed in Greece to help suppress them, and the Greek government is confident that its own troops are sufficient to deal with the situation. However, according to reliable sources, the Greek government has considered referring the footholds of Albania and Yugoslavia, which are assisting the Greek left-wing guerrillas, to the UN Security Council.</p>

<p>[Our Report] London dispatch, 26th: After five years in exile, Greek King George V will return home this coming week. Athens will be completely closed on that day, and all permits to carry firearms will be temporarily suspended to prevent accidents.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Athens, 26th] Greek Prime Minister Tsaldaris announced that as soon as King George returns home and is restored to his throne, he will resign immediately. According to well-informed sources, Tsaldaris may be invited to form an expanded new cabinet. The new government seems likely to take office on the 2nd of next month, so that Tsaldaris can go to Paris to serve as the head of the Greek delegation to the peace conference again.</p>

<p>[Associated Press, RMS Queen Mary, 25th] US Army Chief of Staff Dwight D. Eisenhower hosted reporters on the RMS Queen Mary today. Someone asked about Stalin's statement that US troops should withdraw from China quickly. He replied that only small units of US troops remained stationed in China, and it was at the request of the Chinese government. Eisenhower said that there were some Marines stationed in China, but they were now withdrawing to the coast. He also said that the US Army and Marines stationed in China were few in number and not enough to be seen as a hostile military formation. When asked about Stalin's statement that atomic bombs are only the most destructive weapons in the history of the nervous war, he said that in addition to the immediate effects, there would be more serious consequences.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Paris, 26th - Tehran Radio Broadcast: Iranian radio announced that Prince Firooz led a delegation that departed from Tehran today for Shiraz to begin negotiations with Nazir Qashqai, the leader of the rebel party. Firooz also revealed that Nazir plans to seize the city of Isfahan, which lies between Bushehr and Tehran.

<p>[Another Report] A telegram from Bushehr City in the Persian Gulf states that government forces and local troops have engaged in street fighting in the city, with control of some locations changing hands several times. The situation is extremely fierce. In London, a spokesperson for the British Foreign Office stated that British interests in southern Iran have not been affected by the unrest.

<p>[Associated Press, Manila, 25th] Five hundred overseas Chinese in the Philippines returned to their home country in the autumn of 1941 to visit relatives and obtained permits to return to the Philippines at that time. Unexpectedly, the Pacific War broke out shortly after their return, and these people were stranded in their ancestral homeland until the beginning of this month, when they returned to Manila from Xiamen. However, the Philippine authorities, arguing that the validity period indicated on their permits had expired, refused to allow them to stay, detained them, and intended to deport them. The Chinese Consul General in Manila, Duan Maolan, protested, stating that the overseas Chinese returned to the Philippines after the expiration of their permits due to an irresistible event. The Philippine authorities' attempt to deport them based on such a minor technicality is unjustified. President Roxas has referred the matter to the Cabinet and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for discussion.</p>

<p>— Lu Yu</p>
<p>Introduction</p>
<p>The Paris Peace Conference, which opened in the Luxembourg Palace on July 29 of this year, is an important milestone on Europe's path from war to peace. Such an important event deserves commentary and reporting, and articles on the peace conference are widely published in Chinese and Western newspapers and magazines. However, most of these articles describe the proceedings of the conference or predict its success or failure. Few people have discussed in detail the similarities and differences between this conference and the conference held in the Palace of Versailles twenty-six years ago. However, the importance of this issue is no less than the review of the conference itself, as everyone knows. Only by understanding the successes and failures of the previous conference and their causes can we today promote the success of this conference on the one hand and avoid repeating the mistakes of the past on the other. Only by comparing the differences between the two conferences can we improve the content of this conference and predict its future. The writing of this article is based on this purpose. In short, the purpose of this article is to attempt to identify the shortcomings of this conference compared to the previous conference through a comparison of the two conferences, and to provide improvement strategies to benefit the stability of the European situation and the establishment of world peace. The similarities and differences between the two conferences are compared from the following five aspects: (1) the international situation, (2) the tasks of the conference, (3) the powers of the conference, (4) the organizational structure, and (5) the participants!</p>
<p>(1) Differences in the Situation</p>
<p>The opening of the peace conference after World War I (January 18, 1919) was less than two months after the signing of the Armistice of Compiègne (November 11, 1918), but the convening of this conference was more than a year after the surrender of Germany (May 8, 1945). The longer the time from the end of the war to the convening of the peace conference, the more difficult the future of peace will be, because not only will the cooperative enthusiasm of the wartime allies gradually disappear with the passage of time, but also the disputes and conflicts between the great powers will be endless due to the successive occurrence of various thorny issues. This is why the background of this conference is more complex than that of the previous conference. However, the main reason for the current intensification of the international situation lies in the opposition between the two major blocs, East (Soviet Union) and West (United States, Britain), in the conference. Precisely because of the tension in the relationship between the East and West blocs, the convening of the conference has been delayed until now. Precisely because the conference is late in coming, the international situation has become even more deteriorated. This point was not present in the previous conference and is the biggest factor causing the bleak future of this conference. In the previous conference, although there was opposition between the idealistic U.S. President Wilson and the French Prime Minister Clemenceau, who insisted on a realistic policy, the conflict of opinions between them did not affect the smooth completion of the conference. On the one hand, it relied on the mediation of British Prime Minister Lloyd George, and at that time, Britain still occupied a pivotal position. On the other hand, at that time, the strength of the United States was unmatched by other countries in the world, and people all over the world regarded U.S. President Wilson as the savior from the New World. Therefore, even the roaring and stubborn Tiger Prime Minister Clemenceau had to give way to the United States and the U.S. President. However, the situation today is different. The United States and the Soviet Union are opposed to each other, and Britain's national power has been weakened. Everything is looking to the United States, and it has lost the ability and position to mediate, this is the first point. The United States and the Soviet Union both consider themselves to be the strongest countries in the world, and neither fears the other. Moreover, U.S. President Truman only took office on the eve of the end of the war. His courage, talent, and prestige are not comparable to those of the late President Roosevelt, who was a man of great talent. The Soviet Union's giant Stalin would not and would not make special concessions to the United States, this is the second point.</p>
<p>(2) Differences in Tasks</p>
<p>On this point, the two Paris Peace Conferences also have significant differences. The goal of the 1919 conference was to discuss and sign a treaty with Germany—the main enemy—namely, the Treaty of Versailles (signed on June 28, 1919). Therefore, the scope of its work was limited to the treaty with Germany. As for the treaties with the other four major enemy countries—Austria, Hungary, Bulgaria, and Turkey—they were not signed separately with the relevant countries until after the closure of the Paris Peace Conference. Therefore, the task of the previous conference can be summarized by the four characters "heavy first, light later," that is, first solve the important and difficult problems, and then solve the secondary and easy problems. Today's conference is just the opposite. Originally, in this war, the main enemies of the United Nations were Germany in Europe and Japan in Asia. This conference is limited to Europe, and even within Europe, it only discusses the treaties with the secondary five enemy countries—Italy, Romania, Hungary, Bulgaria, and Finland. The main enemy country, Germany, is not included and will be discussed at a separate conference at a later date. Therefore, the task of this conference can be called "avoiding the heavy and taking the light," that is, avoiding the difficult problem (Germany) and only seeking compromises on the secondary difficult problems (Italy, Romania, Hungary, Bulgaria, and Finland). Precisely because the previous conference was not afraid of difficulties and first dealt with the main difficulties, once solved, everything else was solved. Therefore, the conference was able to achieve results in a short period of time. Precisely because this conference lacks courage and avoids discussing thorny issues, dragging everything out, for a month the Paris Peace Conference has only seen disputes and few agreements. This is another point where this conference is inferior to the previous conference.</p>
<p>(3) Differences in Powers</p>
<p>The previous conference had full power over the task it was responsible for, namely, discussing and signing a treaty with Germany. In other words, the Paris Peace Conference held in the Palace of Versailles was the highest authority at that time, and there was no other institution above it. This conference is different. Its power is limited to discussing the draft treaties (including the agreed-upon clauses and the unresolved matters) for the five countries of Italy, Romania, Hungary, Bulgaria, and Finland, which were submitted by the Council of Foreign Ministers of the Four Powers, and may provide amendment opinions. Although according to the resolution of the Rules Committee of the Conference, the foreign ministers of the Four Powers should give serious consideration to and adopt the above-mentioned amendment opinions when finally drafting the treaties, this provision does not have the nature of law, and everything is still decided by the Council of Foreign Ministers of the Four Powers. Therefore, the current Paris Peace Conference, which is meeting in the magnificent Luxembourg Palace, is only a consultative body to the Council of Foreign Ministers of the Four Powers. It has no full power to discuss treaties, nor can it establish binding resolutions. It is appropriate for Australian representative Evatt to complain loudly, "The Paris Peace Conference should not only be consultative in nature, but should give all countries genuine and effective participation, so the drafting of treaties should belong to all countries, not just the three or four powers." Precisely because the previous conference had full powers, it had high prestige and great efficiency. Although the treaties it established were not without debatable points, it was able to solve a major problem in half a year (from the opening of the peace conference on January 18, 1919, to the signing of the treaty on June 28 of the same year). It is worthy of praise in stabilizing the world situation. Looking back at this conference, its powers are limited, and its nature is consultative. Therefore, the countries of the world do not pay much attention to it. Therefore, it is really difficult to expect it to exert great power and live up to the enthusiasm of the people of the world!</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Yesterday morning, the forward edge of a strong Pacific typhoon swept through the city, with winds reaching a magnitude of five. According to the observatory, the typhoon has already made landfall in the northwest of Fuzhou and is sweeping towards the border between Hunan and Jiangxi provinces. Therefore, the city is no longer in danger of being hit. Although it rained heavily all day yesterday, it is expected to clear up from this afternoon. Also, at 3:15 a.m. yesterday morning, a section of wall in front of No. 1 Huaxing Road suddenly collapsed due to the wind, injuring three people, Xi Zuling, Shen Xiaolong, and Luo Gen, who were crushed by the wall. They were rushed to Renji Hospital for emergency treatment.</p>
<p>Shanghai Meteorological Observatory Report: Siberian anticyclone in North and Central China, Pacific air mass in Japan, Korea, East China Sea, and Ryukyu Islands. After the typhoon made landfall, a low-pressure area formed in Fujian and Zhejiang, pushing north to the lower reaches of the Yangtze River. Its central location at 2:00 p.m. today (26th) was at 28 degrees north latitude and 119 degrees east longitude, moving north. "Weather forecast": Yellow Sea, cloudy, hazy, localized fog, light to moderate easterly winds, large waves. Central China, cloudy, showers, or rain, moderate to light northeasterly to southeasterly winds. Shanghai, cloudy, showers, or rain, gradually improving, moderate easterly winds, occasional showers. East China Sea, southern cloudy, showers, light to strong easterly to southerly winds, large waves, turbulent sea lanes around Taiwan. "Temperature on the 26th": highest 80.6 degrees, lowest 70.9 degrees. (Another report) Yesterday, the tide level reached 13.9 feet, which is rare. Coupled with heavy rain, low-lying roads became flooded again. The new floodgate built in the former Public Concession in the central district has been completed. The high tide around the Mid-Autumn Festival occurred on a clear day, and the floodgate blocked the tide, preventing it from flowing back and overflowing the road surface. Yesterday's tide was higher than the low-lying road surface. Although the floodgate automatically closed tightly, rainwater on the road could not be discharged. All pumping stations were fully operational to pump water, but they still had to wait for the tide to recede before the floodgate automatically opened to discharge the water. As for the former French Concession and the Yangshupu and Hongkou areas, floodgates are being planned and implemented. Therefore, even if the high tide occurs on a clear day, low-lying roads are also flooded by the backflow of the tide. The flooding situation yesterday was even more severe. By 5:00 p.m. yesterday, the water on all roads had gradually receded with the tide.</p>
<p>This hurricane caused significant impact to shipping routes along the coast. China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's ships Hai De, Hai Su, and Hai Zhou, Taikoo's Nanchang, and Ewo's Yong Sheng, all of which were supposed to arrive in Shanghai the day before yesterday, had not yet entered the port as of yesterday. It is said that the Nanchang is in Shantou, and the Yong Sheng is still in Hong Kong. The Hai Qian is also sheltering from the wind in Dagu. On the export side, Jardine Matheson's Zhazha Lianjia, originally scheduled to leave Shanghai on the 25th to return south, was also blocked by the hurricane. If the wind subsides today, it will be able to export. The American President Lines' Whistler and Capital Victory, both originally scheduled to leave Shanghai yesterday, have also not set sail.</p>

<h3 id="e70">On a Stormy Night, the Yuying Warehouse Suffers Robbery; Losses Totaling Hundreds of Millions; Gang of Thieves Sails Across the River to Rob <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The Yuying Company warehouse at No. 212 Jichang Street in Nanshi, located near the Huangpu River, is jointly organized by various factories and is filled with a large amount of American goods, such as car tires, safes, electric stoves, radios, glass raincoats, glass shoes, pigments, and various other American goods. These goods were stored more than six months ago and have not yet been sold. Recently, another batch arrived a week ago, so the goods in the warehouse were piled up like mountains, attracting the attention of thieves.</p>
<p>Around 3:00 a.m. yesterday morning, more than twenty thieves suddenly arrived in three sailboats, landed, and managed to open the gate of the Yuying Company warehouse and entered one after another. A thief leader held a pistol, and the others held axes, iron bars, and ropes. They first tied up the four watchmen with hemp ropes, covered them with quilts, and prevented them from making any noise. Then, they used axes to cut through the wooden fences of the warehouse. Except for heavy machinery and safes that could not be carried away, other light goods, such as radios, glass raincoats, pigments, lipsticks, and sundries, dozens of bundles in total, were repeatedly carried down to the boats by the thieves. The robbery lasted more than two hours. At that time, it was raining heavily, and no one noticed. The thieves looted and escaped. Afterwards, the watchmen struggled to break free, reported to the warehouse director Du Bingqing, and jointly reported to the Penglai Police Station. Director Yao of the branch office, after receiving the report, ordered his officers to rush to investigate and telegraphed the Water Police Station and the Port Police Station to assist in the pursuit. The losses this time cannot be accurately estimated at once, but are generally in the tens of millions of yuan or more.</p>

<p>Huang Xuchu, Chairman of the Guangxi Provincial Government, recently returned to Guangxi from Lushan. He arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning from Nanjing to visit President Song and is scheduled to leave Shanghai for Guangxi by plane on the 29th. Mr. Huang met with reporters yesterday afternoon and spoke freely about the post-war rehabilitation situation in Guangxi and the work of rebuilding Guangxi. Chairman Huang first stated that during the Anti-Japanese War, most of Guangxi's territory was a battlefield and suffered greatly. Seventy-five of the more than one hundred counties were successively occupied by the enemy, and both urban and rural areas were severely damaged. After the war, people's livelihoods were extremely difficult, and everything needed to be restored urgently. This time, he came to Shanghai to discuss the overall financial situation of Guangxi with President Song and to seek President Song's instructions. At present, the most serious problems in Guangxi are economic panic and rural poverty. After the war, all the farming tools and cattle were looted and killed by the Japanese, making it impossible to carry out large-scale farming. In addition, this year's autumn harvest was poor, creating a major economic crisis. A large number of farmers have fled to cities to make a living, and efforts are being made to remedy this undesirable phenomenon.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Since the Municipal Council resolved to increase the city's entertainment tax to 50%, the theatrical community has been extremely anxious because they cannot bear the burden. At 11:00 a.m. yesterday, representatives of the city's cinema industry association went to the Municipal Council to petition. Speaker Pan personally received them and earnestly advised them that the increase in entertainment tax was purely to balance the city's budget revenue and expenditure and was based on the provisions of central government laws and regulations. If there are any special suggestions or opinions, they can be stated in writing and left for the council to discuss again.</p>
<p>[Another Report] The city's theatrical industry association convened a meeting of industry representatives at the Datian Stage at 5:00 p.m. yesterday, believing that the 50% entertainment tax is really difficult to bear given the current serious crisis facing the theatrical industry. Therefore, it was decided to petition the Municipal Council again. More than 70 representatives attended the meeting yesterday, and the entire body decided to grant the directors and supervisors of the industry association full power to negotiate and to proceed after contacting the film industry association.</p>

<p>The congestion in the city's wharf warehouses affects the entire import and export business. The reporter visited the relevant authorities to understand the recent situation of the seized enemy and puppet wharf warehouses. According to reports, the former enemy and puppet warehouses in the city that currently store enemy and puppet materials include: one along the river in Yangshupu, one at Huishan Wharf, three at Huangpu Wharf; in the urban area, three at Maigen Road Mitsui Yoko, four at Suzhou Road Lihe Yoko, twenty at East Broadway Road and Lan Road, one at Hongkou Xiangyanqiao Road, and one at Harbin Road. The enemy and puppet materials in the above warehouses can be cleared out in October of this year. The Taikoo Warehouse is still used by the Ministry of Military and Political Affairs. Other warehouses rented or used exclusively by the U.S. Army and Navy include one Huashang Yongxin warehouse in Yangshupu, seven warehouses at Qiujiang Wharf, fourteen warehouses at Huishan Wharf, nine warehouses at Yangshupu Osaka Wharf, and the Japanese Post Office Company's wharf and warehouses No. 2, No. 5, and No. 6 at Hongkou Huangpu Road.</p>
<h3 id="e74">Unauthorized Pricing; Returning Farmland; Investigation Team Believes the Land Administration Bureau Exceeded Its Authority <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Currently, in the City Council, the investigation team has also paid attention to the point of questioning the high-ranking officials of the Land Administration Bureau for returning the Gaohua farmland with corruption. According to detailed investigation, it was learned that the Land Administration Bureau exceeded its authority in handling enemy property. The Shanghai Experimental Economic Farm of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry received enemy and puppet materials, but there was no inventory regarding the Zhonghua and Dafeng farms in Gaohua. These two farms occupy a total area of more than 4,000 mu and were established by the enemy's Hengchan Co., Ltd. by purchasing land from the people, which was cultivated by local people. After the victory, the Japanese fled. The Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry ordered Jiang Hongwei, the manager of Zhonghua Agricultural Products, to organize a rent collection office together with the appointed personnel. Later, because the income could not cover the expenses, and Jiang Hongwei could not specify the location of the Zhonghua Dafeng farm one by one, the rent collection office was revoked and incorporated into the Jungong Road branch. The two farms should have been handled by the Enemy and Puppet Industry Handling Bureau. Since they have not been handled, they should be kept by the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry. However, the Land Administration Bureau arbitrarily agreed to the local people's request and returned the land at its own price. The Handling Bureau believes that this is inappropriate. In addition, the money obtained from the sale should be remitted to the Qing Suan Office.</p>

<p>Vice Admiral Power, Commander-in-Chief of the British Pacific Fleet, arrived in Shanghai aboard the cruiser HMS Belfast the day before yesterday from the capital.

<h3 id="e77">Legal Perspectives on Horse Racing: Lottery Issuance in Our Country Always Adopts a Concession System; If Approved by the Government, It Is Not a Gambling Activity <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>[Our Own Report] The horse racing issue, which has drawn citywide attention, remains unresolved after heated discussions at the City Council the day before yesterday. Whether selling lottery tickets in conjunction with horse racing constitutes gambling is still awaiting clarification from the central government. Yesterday, a reporter specially visited Lawyer Jiang Ping, who first proposed asking the central government for clarification during the general assembly, to inquire about how our country's laws regulate this matter. According to the discussion: those who support and those who oppose the resumption of horse racing each have substantial reasons. Horse racing itself is certainly not gambling, but issuing lottery tickets because of horse racing is completely the same in nature as gambling. However, whether it is punished as gambling under the law is quite different. According to various countries around the world, the issuance of lottery tickets is either prohibited, allowed, or subject to a concession system. Our country's law adopts a concession system. According to Article 269 of the Gambling Section of the Criminal Law: Anyone who issues lottery tickets without government approval shall be punished for gambling. From this inference: if lottery tickets are issued with government approval, it is not a gambling activity. Therefore, regarding the issue of horse racing issuing lottery tickets, it must be requested from the central government before a solution can be reached. Otherwise, even if the City Council passes a resolution considering it not gambling, without the central government's approval and concession, directly resuming horse racing and issuing lottery tickets should still be considered gambling in law.</p>
<h3 id="e78">Views of Legal Professionals in Nanjing <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Nanjing on the 26th] A certain counselor from the Judicial Yuan said: When the "Is Horse Racing Gambling?" case raised by the Shanghai City Council is submitted to the central government for interpretation in the future, he believes it is very likely to be considered "horse racing is a gambling activity." It is claimed that although there are no precedents to review regarding this matter, according to the Criminal Law, horse racing with betting behavior will certainly constitute a gambling crime, because Article 266 of Chapter 21 of the Criminal Law stipulates that "Anyone who gambles for money in public places or places accessible to the public shall be fined up to one thousand yuan." If horse racing resumes in Shanghai and involves selling champagne, etc., it is the same as the above article. He also pointed out the difference between horse racing and boxing and circus performances, because boxing and circus are only sports or entertainment in nature. If there is no betting behavior, even performing in "places accessible to the public" cannot be considered a gambling activity, and it cannot be prohibited. When a reporter asked about a Shanghai councilor's statement: "In the past, the government held prize-bearing savings bonds, doesn't that also have gambling significance?" the reply was: "Article 269 of the Criminal Law stipulates that anyone who intends to profit by running prize-bearing savings or issues lottery tickets without government approval shall be sentenced to imprisonment or detention for not more than one year." Prize-bearing savings bonds that have been approved by the government in advance are not subject to this article. Finally, he concluded that: The reason why Shanghai allowed horse racing in the past was entirely because Shanghai was a foreign concession with special circumstances. Now that the concession has been recovered, this kind of abnormal situation cannot be allowed, and it cannot be forced to recognize horse racing as a legitimate activity just because foreign countries allow horse racing.</p>
<h3 id="e79">Not Yet Detrimental to the Country or the People: Wei Shanfu, Director of the Pseudo-City Chamber of Commerce, Acquitted; Li Kaichen and Zhang Yinghui to Be Sentenced on October 3 <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>[Our Own Report] The High Court announced three cases yesterday: (1) Zhu Changsheng, the pseudo-Baolzhang of Ziteng Township in Minhang Town, relied on his power to poison the villagers and was sentenced to five years of imprisonment. (2) E Tuo Bolang, a military commentator for the German Embassy's XGRS radio station, was sentenced to two and a half years of imprisonment for making distorted propaganda for the enemy and collecting intelligence. (3) Wei Shanfu, who once served as a director of the pseudo-Shanghai City Chamber of Commerce, was declared not guilty because his actions were not detrimental to the country or the people.</p>
<p>On the same day, the trials of Li Kaichen, the former director of the pseudo-Shanghai Maritime Affairs Bureau, and Zhang Zeng were concluded, and sentencing was scheduled for October 3.</p>
<p>Personal Secretary of Pan Da</p>
<p>Further investigations into multiple cases: (1) Shen Liang, from Wu County, 40 years old, was accused of serving as a section member of the Huxi Special Police Bureau and as the personal secretary of Pan Da, the director of the bureau, and also as a special policeman. He colluded with the 76th Division to carry out the Qingxiang Movement. Shen testified in court yesterday: He had served as a special policeman of the Municipal Council. After resigning, he was introduced by an Englishman named Kelaisuo to serve as a special policeman in Huxi. Later, he suddenly changed to an office clerk, so he did not take the position. In order to avoid the trouble of being on guard duty in the Self-Defense Corps, the household registration form still listed him as a special policeman.</p>
<p>Forced Concentration of British Nationals</p>
<p>(2) Ka Tusi, an Indian, originally served as a patrolman during the Shanghai Municipal Council era. After the Japanese occupation of the concession during the Pacific War, he was responsible for guarding the British concentration camp. After the victory, a British national named Hua Sheng accused Ka of using the enemy's power to oppress people. The defendant denied it in court yesterday.</p>
<p>Collecting Foil Ash to Aid the Enemy</p>
<p>(3) Feng Xiaozhai served as the chairman of the pseudo-Shanghai Foil Ash Industry Association during the enemy and puppet period and was accused of collecting tin foil ash to aid the enemy and melting it for military use. The above three cases were adjourned for further questioning.</p>
<p>[Another Report] The High Procuratorate has now indicted Tian Tiefu, Wu Huanian, Chen Mingde, and Xue Asi for suspected treason, and Tang Xianxin for suspected internal disorder.</p>

<h3 id="e82">German Catholic Priest Arrested and Escorted to Shanghai on Suspicion <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>Ellen, a German Catholic priest, 40 years old, fluent in Chinese, recently intended to make some attempt in Xuzhou by using the identity of a priest to preach. He changed the Shanghai to Nanjing passport issued by our Ministry of Foreign Affairs to Shanghai to Xuzhou with a decolorizing potion. On the 14th of this month, he went to Xuzhou with the staff of the General Relief Administration and stayed at the Xuzhou Catholic Church. His words and deeds were suspected by the priest of the church, and he reported the information to the Xuzhou Pacification Commissioner's Office. After dispatching personnel to arrest Ellen, it was discovered that the passport had been altered, and detailed Chinese maps, radio receivers, and important secret documents were found. As things were suspicious, it was found that it was related to a certain case in Shanghai, so he was escorted to the Songhu Garrison Command Military Law Office for interrogation. The Military Law Office is now studying it in detail.</p>
<h3 id="e83">Handling the Sun Tianchangzhi Case: Investigation Team Releases Details; Complicated Case Awaiting Detailed Investigation by the High Court; Believes Sun's Wife's Activities Everywhere Are Quite Wrong <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>(Our Own Report) The Investigation Team has decided to end its work and return to the capital at the end of the month. The progress of handling various cases in the past two months will be published in a list soon. For unfinished cases, Committee Member Zhang Qingzhen will continue to be responsible for handling them. As for the Sun Tianchangzhi case, the handling process was released yesterday as follows:</p>
<p>Our team has always believed that this case is an important case for receiving and handling enemy and puppet assets. After receiving the secret report, our team first submitted it to the committee for deliberation and convened the director of the handling bureau and the review committee members to inquire about the case in detail. After reviewing the entire file, we learned that Sun Tianchangzhi's property had been seized and returned. Checking that it was a specific act of receiving and returning was a specific work of handling, our team was very concerned about whether this receiving and handling was improper. Committee Member Zhang Qingzhen was responsible for handling it, and the informant and Sun Tianchangzhi were summoned and interrogated separately. Committee Member Wu Wangji also reviewed the case and concluded that the case was complicated. If the judicial authorities were not entrusted to conduct a detailed investigation, it would not be enough to understand the extent of improper handling or improper receiving. Therefore, it was proposed to the committee for deliberation and transferred to the Shanghai Higher People's Court Procuratorate for investigation. This move was originally to respect judicial authority and clarify the case. During the investigation, the original informant and Sun Tianchangzhi should be investigated and should not rely on any forces to influence the case. However, it is heard that Sun Tianchangzhi's wife is active everywhere, distributing leaflets, hoping to rely on extrajudicial forces to resist legal power, which is quite wrong.</p>
<p>According to its legal experts' observation: The Investigation Team handled this case quite carefully and legally. If Sun Tianchangzhi is a Japanese, his property is enemy property. If he is not a Japanese, but the property obtained by using enemy and puppet forces is also subject to confiscation. If there is a behavior of offering planes and manufacturing military supplies to aid the enemy, it constitutes a war crime.</p>
<h3 id="e84">Watching the Tide in the Rain: Returning from Gaoqiao All Soaked <a href="#e84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>[Our Own Report] According to the report of the Observatory, yesterday was the highest tide day of this year. The Public Works Bureau specially invited the local news media to Gaoqiao Seawall to watch the tide yesterday morning and to visit the completed restoration project of the breach in the seawall.</p>
<p>Those who went to visit yesterday included Zhu Guoxi, Director of the Structural Department of the Public Works Bureau and Commander of the Seawall Project; Zhu Qingyu, Deputy Commander; and Commissioner Qian Weiyu, as well as 13 reporters from various newspapers. Although the rain was pouring down, they were all in high spirits. They boarded the municipal ferry at 8:30 AM and arrived at their destination two hours later. At that time, because it was not yet high tide, the water surface was still more than 20 meters away from the embankment. Unable to withstand the rain for a long time, they went to the seaside bathhouse cafeteria to chat. At about 1:00 PM, it was the saturation point of the tide. They set off again in the rain and stood on the seawall, seeing only a vast ocean, with the beach all submerged. According to Director Zhu, if the seawall is not repaired this year, the consequences will be unimaginable. If a high tide like yesterday's comes, the embankment will collapse completely, and the entire town of Gaoqiao will be in danger.</p>
<p>At 2:30 PM, after eating at the office of the Engineering Headquarters of the Gaoqiao Public Works Bureau, they boarded two large and small trucks prepared by the bureau and rushed to the Municipal Ferry Terminal. The small truck broke down halfway due to muddy roads and damp machine parts. So everyone had to squeeze into a large, open-top truck carrying gravel to get on the road. When the ferry arrived, it was already past 6:00 PM. The rain was still heavy, and everyone was soaked.</p>
<h3 id="e85">Australia Also Feels the Housing Shortage: Food and Clothing Still Strictly Rationed: Australian Envoy Speaks at Rotary Club <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>[Our Own Report] The Shanghai Rotary Club held a meeting at the Duchen Hotel yesterday. Australian Envoy to China Copeland gave a speech, stating that although Australia's losses in this war were not as severe as those of China, Britain, and other countries, to cope with this full-scale war, it also mobilized 60% of the country's men to engage in combat or war industries, and more than 30% of women. To adapt to wartime needs, labor control and rationing systems were implemented, prices were strictly controlled, and taxes on the people were heavy, so as to stabilize the economy and exert full effort to win the victory. After the outbreak of the Pacific War, the number of Australian troops participating in actual combat was huge, and at the same time, a large number of essential materials were supplied to the US military and other Allied forces in the Pacific, India, and the Middle East. The loss of people's businesses was especially heavy, and the current housing shortage is also serious. Some farmland cannot be cultivated due to lack of fertilizer. Therefore, although various countries have a great need for Australian products, Australia has to temporarily devote its full energy to dealing with various domestic problems. However, wartime efforts have greatly increased Australia's production of food, textiles, steel, and chemicals needed for shipbuilding. Optical instruments and medicines have also made great progress. When the war broke out, the Australian government's income was 800 million pounds, which later increased to 1.25 billion pounds. Wartime prices increased by about 22.5%.</p>
<p>Australia still strictly implements the food and clothing rationing system. Because all textiles must first be supplied to the people of the country for distribution and sale, the quantity of exports must be limited. As for food, Australia's rice production is not large, with an annual output of only about 20,000 tons. Among them, a small amount is used for medical purposes and the needs of some local overseas Chinese, and the entire amount has been transported to the Middle East and Asia, hoping to be of small help in the midst of the world rice shortage. Although the quantity is small, it already includes the total amount of rice produced in Australia.</p>
<p>The current issues facing the Australian government are: (1) In addition to building 500 houses each year, at least 250,000 houses must be built first. (2) Reorganize and repair various major industries that have been damaged by the war, such as railways. (3) Increase the production of various items that are still insufficient, such as clothing, household appliances (electrical equipment and refrigerators).</p>
<p>Mr. Ke said at the end that any democratic country that wants to ensure freedom and security must pay attention to national defense and domestic stability. Therefore, Australia had to increase its budget by another 100 million pounds this year, and before the war, the entire budget was less than 100 million pounds, so the tax standard cannot be restored to the pre-war situation.</p>

<h3 id="e89">Japanese War Criminal ShibaHaraHei Under Trial: Admits to Setting Up a Secret Room to Abuse Women: Military Tribunal Sends Personnel to Hangzhou to Investigate <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>[Our Own Report] Since the new President of the First Pacification Zone Military Tribunal, Li Liang, and the Chief Clerk, Li Ye Chu, took office, they have actively reorganized the work and resumed the trial of Japanese war criminals yesterday. Yesterday afternoon, the investigation court brought to trial the defendant ShibaHaraHei Sanlang (47 years old, from Tokushima Prefecture). During the invasion of China, he served as the information director of the Hangzhou Army Special Affairs Agency, the branch director of the Jinhua Special Affairs Agency, the chief of the political section, the Ningbo Security Section Chief, and the director of the Cixi Branch of the Army Liaison Department. The criminal is a Chinese expert, proficient in the Shanghai and Hangzhou dialects. During his tenure, in addition to spying on our country's military intelligence and collecting and controlling various materials, he also used local tyrants to recruit rogue hooligans as his henchmen, and induced women from good families to provide him with adultery. Hundreds of women in the Jinhua and Ningbo areas were insulted by him. The local residents hated him with gritted teeth. At that time, the Japanese authorities also handed him over to the Hangzhou Gendarmerie for legal proceedings because he was too evil, but he was not convicted because he had a special relationship with Watanabe, the head of the Special Affairs Agency. After the victory, he fled to Shanghai and hid in 18 Xingjiazhai. He was arrested by our military agencies and sent to the military tribunal. The criminal admitted that he had set up a secret room near the Sixth Park on Hubin Road in Hangzhou, dedicated to adultery and pleasure. Now the military tribunal has sent personnel to the Hangzhou area and requested the local government to notify various towns and villages that those who were humiliated by him during the occupation period can report as much as possible so that the criminal can be sentenced to death.</p>

<h3 id="e91">Summer Property Tax Late Payment Fines: Reasons for Declaration Can Be Waived <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>The Municipal Finance Bureau's collection of summer property tax uses a four-part payment form. Citizens pay to the collection office according to the deadline listed on it. According to the interim rules for the collection of property tax, this deadline should be at least 14 days. However, it has recently been learned that when some households receive the payment form, the deadline is very tight, resulting in disputes over late payment fines. It is heard that the Finance Bureau has now stipulated that if the deadline for citizens to receive the payment form is less than 14 days, they can write the actual date of receipt of the payment form on the back of the second part of the property tax payment form, as well as "If it is found that the payment is overdue after investigation, I am willing to be responsible for paying the late payment fine as required." After the taxpayer signs and seals it, they can be exempted from paying the late payment fine. If some have already paid, they can state: (1) the name and address of the household, (2) the date of receipt of the property tax payment form, (3) the date of payment of the property tax, (4) the receipt number and amount of the late payment fine, and send a letter directly to the Finance Bureau's property tax section to request verification. If it is confirmed that the deadline has not been exceeded, the paid fine can be retrieved from the original payment location.</p>

<p>[Our Own Report] The American Military Tribunal here brought 27 suspected Nazi spies to trial at 8:00 AM yesterday. First, the judge refuted the arguments made by the defendant's lawyer during the last trial: (1) that the US military tribunal has no right to try Nazi war criminals in the country, (2) that the defendant's evidence of guilt is insufficient, that they are German expatriates, and that they should be released by the Chinese court. Lu Wei said: "Although the defendant resides in China, the crimes committed are not only violations of Chinese law, but violations of international law and custom. After Germany's unconditional surrender, the defendant continued to engage in military activities and assisted Japan in resisting the United States and its allies, so the work of trying such criminals still falls within the scope of the power of the American Military Tribunal. The trial by this court should continue." After a brief questioning, it was announced that the trial would resume on the 3rd of next month.</p>

<p>Without Understanding, We Cannot Have Peace; Without Education, We Cannot Have Peace.</p>
<p>[US Information Service, 25th] President Truman met with members of the US National Commission for UNESCO at the White House today, shaking hands with each member: "I believe that cultural and educational organizations will contribute to world peace no less than other organizations related to the United Nations. They will awaken our power to strive for peace. When we understand the views of others and others understand ours, we can engage in discussions and abandon various disagreements. Without understanding, we cannot have peace; without education, we cannot have peace. If we can exchange educators with other countries and send our educators to various countries to proclaim our views, the clarification of the world situation will not be far off. Among the forty-eight member states of the United Nations, we will have no difficulties, or any difficulties that cannot be resolved peacefully, because we already understand each other. I attach great importance to the UNESCO, and I believe that if the organization carries out its work according to its original intention, it will make unprecedented and great contributions to the welfare of all mankind. In the world, what I most earnestly desire are two things: world peace and domestic unity. What I have done since entering the White House has been for this. This was also the working goal of President Roosevelt."</p>

<h3 id="e112">Tang Zeng and Others Initiate "School Donation for Birthday Celebration": Six Methods Proposed <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>More than one hundred people from the educational and journalistic circles in this city, including Tang Zengjiao, Sun Dongcheng, Zhong Juemin, Qian Fugong, etc., had long proposed the establishment of universal national schools in view of the large number of out-of-school children and illiterates across the country. Now that the 60th birthday of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek of the National Government is approaching, people across the country are preparing to offer congratulations to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek. However, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, mindful of the difficulties facing the nation and the suffering of the people, believes that we should strive for governance and not merely engage in formalities and extravagance. The Central Executive Committee of the Kuomintang has issued an order for all party members to comply. The people of the whole country should also share the difficulties of the times, understand Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's intentions, and, without violating the principle of "no extravagance," seek other ways to benefit national construction and rejuvenation in order to celebrate Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's birthday. However, in this time of national revival, there are many ways to build the country, and we should choose the most important and pressing one to do first in order to meet the actual needs. At the same time, in fact, we should seek what is easily accepted by Chairman Chiang Kai-shek. After repeated consideration, Tang Zeng and others believe that popularizing national schools to promote national education, thereby helping out-of-school children and eliminating illiteracy across the country, is a more appropriate approach. Therefore, they propose the "School Donation" method. After its publication, it is heard that it has been enthusiastically responded to by all sectors of the city. It is hoped that the people of the whole country will also respond and contribute generously to share in this grand event. The methods for "School Donation" are explored and recorded below: (1) All provinces, cities, counties, and groups across the country should immediately formulate methods for people to voluntarily donate money and organize a "School Donation for Birthday Celebration Committee" to facilitate the process. (2) People's donations should be entirely voluntary. The donation goal should be that each province, city, and county, at least each autonomous region, should be able to add at least one national school. (3) On the day of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's birthday, each province, city, and county should separately present a list of the amount of donations and the units where national schools can be added to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek to express congratulations, and also publish it in newspapers to inform the public. (4) These national schools should all be prefixed with the words "Kai-shek" to show permanent remembrance.

<p>Journalists vs. Movie Stars at 7 PM</p>
<p>[This Newspaper] Since arriving in Shanghai, the Qunsheng basketball team has demonstrated superb skills, winning all four games, astonishing the Shanghai sports scene. The Basketball Committee, previously lacking more than 7 million yuan for building a floor, took this opportunity to invite the guest team to play a charity game against the strong Western team, the Giants, in order to make up for the deficit. Tonight's revenue, after deducting expenses, will be used to subsidize the shortfall. Tickets are still priced at 2,000 yuan for the upper level and 5,000 yuan for the lower level. Complimentary tickets will not be issued, and military and police personnel must purchase tickets to enter the stadium in order to increase revenue. At the same time, in order to avoid congestion, ticket sales will begin at 3 PM, and the gates will open at 5:30 PM.</p>
<p>News Reporters Face Off Against Movie Stars</p>
<p>In the first game, journalists will face off against movie stars. The former is organized by sports reporters from various newspapers in the city. Usually, the reporters just talk on paper, pointing fingers and commenting, but today they will put aside their ink and paste, put on their uniforms, and show off their skills, letting the fans see the "work" of the reporters. Because the members of the reporter team are composed of reporters from various newspapers, in order to avoid self-promotion, the "unique skills" and masterpieces of the team members will not be promoted in advance. The movie star team has already been famous in the city before the war, and is now resurrected. All the members are shining stars on the screen. The lineup is even more complete than before the war. In addition to Liu Qiong, Jin Yan, and Liang Dusheng, Shu Shi, Ren Yawei, Chen Tianguo, etc., are tall and strong, and Wang Xuewu has also joined the lineup, so once they meet, the movie stars are more likely to win.</p>
<p>Giants are Good at Calculating: Qunsheng Should Be Wary</p>
<p>The main game starts at 8 PM, with Qunsheng facing the Giants. In terms of the situation, Qunsheng can undoubtedly beat the Giants. However, in terms of tactics, the Giants are known in Shanghai for their cunning and resourcefulness, and their ability to see through people's weaknesses. The Giants players all came to watch when Qunsheng took the field, so they are confident. At that time, they will use unexpected strategies to win, and Qunsheng must be careful.</p>

<p>Household Registration Training Center No. 1, Record of Discussions by the Household Registration Issue Group:</p>
<p>(1) Question: After a household moves out, another household moves in. The former head of household did not apply for move-out registration.

<h3 id="e123">Yesterday Another Surge of 500,000 - Rayon Creates Unprecedented High Price - Spinning &amp; Construction Listing Increased by One Million From Previous - Italian Goods Have Been Shipped, 600 Cases <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>[Our Report] Yesterday, the rayon price surge was even more intense. No. 120, Tianqiao Youguang opened at 3.65 million yuan, jumped to 8 million yuan at closing. In the afternoon, because the listing price of the Spinning and Construction Company was one million higher than the previous period, and the allocation quantity was reduced, the black market was wildly inflated, shouting from 8 million yuan to 4.1 million yuan. In the end, it was sold for 15 million yuan. General real sales manufacturers were at a loss and panicked, all believing that the allocation of the Spinning and Construction Company was inappropriate, forcing manufacturers to bankruptcy. According to industry insiders, rayon is not produced in our country and has always relied on countries such as Japan and Italy for supply. After the victory, due to the lack of commercial agreements, transportation and sales were difficult. However, the outer-area electric motors, knitting, silk edging factories, and other factories in need of rayon, rely on rayon merchants' inventory supply, as well as enemy and puppet materials received by the government, which are distributed and sold by the Spinning and Construction Company in installments. However, since September 5th, the allocation and sales of rayon merchants have been cancelled, purely allocated to production manufacturers. Since then, the rayon market situation has been rising continuously. This is because rayon is not produced domestically, unlike cotton yarn, and its sales are not limited to electric motor silk weaving factories. Factories in this and other areas are afraid of a shortage of goods, and all are trying to find them. The less goods allocated by Spinning and Construction, the more urgent the demand, leading to the unprecedented high price of rayon. As for the rayon merchants' own inventory, it is extremely limited. Since Spinning and Construction stopped allocating, routine operations have become even more difficult to carry out. The Rayon Trade Association has written to the Spinning and Construction Company for this appeal. It is now known that a reply has been received from the Spinning and Construction Company, roughly stating that after the Central Trust Bureau ships rayon from Japan, they will consider the allocation method again.</p>
<p>The Cost of Italian Rayon - 1.15 Million</p>
<p>Two batches of Italian rayon have recently arrived, totaling 600 cases. It is reported that 400 of these cases are goods ordered by people outside the industry, with a cost price of 500,000 yuan per case, and taxes and fees of 650,000 yuan, totaling 1.15 million yuan per case. The reporter then visited Director Jiang of the Business Department of the China Spinning and Construction Company to inquire about the company's allocation of rayon. He specifically stated two points: First, the rayon allocated by Spinning and Construction is all owned by the Enemy and Puppet Property Management Bureau, and Spinning and Construction is only acting as an agent for allocation and sales.</p>
<p>Allocation Price Has Not Moved for a Long Time - New Market is Still Low</p>
<p>Second, after the exchange rate adjustment, the allocation price has remained unchanged, at 1.3 million yuan per case. However, the market has risen sharply. During yesterday's allocation, because the market price had reached more than 3 million yuan, the allocation price was slightly adjusted, but it was still about 70% lower than the market price. To date, more than 10,000 cases have been allocated in succession. It is said that, in terms of the production manufacturers applying for allocation alone, there are about 200 companies each time. Ordinary manufacturers get one case each, while elastic band factories, etc., mostly get one case for every four companies. Yesterday, more than 200 cases were allocated. It is also heard that the Central Trust Bureau has ordered 10,000 cases of rayon from Japan, and 3,000 cases have already arrived in Shanghai.</p>
<h3 id="e124">Government Bonds Gradually Decline <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>Government bonds are still under sporadic supply, unable to rally. Tong Bing opened at 1,890 yuan, with a high price of only 1,930 yuan, which was blocked and fell. The market was low to 1,730 yuan, and closed at 1,800 yuan. As a result, it fell 210 yuan from the previous close. The rest also decreased by 100 yuan to 150 yuan. The transaction volume was still more than 3 million yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e125">Foreign Stock Transactions Were Scarce <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>There were not many foreign stock transactions. People from the Chaozhou community had a slight appetite for Jardine Matheson, but it was difficult to save the overall situation. Ewo Cotton opened at 8,800 yuan, with sporadic liquidation, and then retreated to 8,300 yuan. The steel industry's transactions were quiet, without any changes. As a result, Ewo Cotton, British American Tobacco, Jardine Matheson, paper industry, and shipping each fell by about half a percent compared to the previous close. The steel industry was flat.</p>
<h3 id="e126">Rice Market Firm <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>[Our Report] Yesterday, more than 10,000 dans of rice arrived in the northern and southern markets. The Social Affairs Bureau also threw out a large batch of rice. The appetite of the shops was still acceptable, and the trend was stable. The flour factory allocated and sold 9,000 bags to another sales company, and the price remained unchanged. The wheat from the north and south oceans was cleared. Soybeans from the South Ocean were moving but not prosperous. Dalian soybeans had slight transactions. Medium-grade soybeans still did not escape fatigue. Raw peanuts fell and stabilized. Sesame remained flat, but black sesame was prominent. Corn was sluggish and flat. Red sorghum was very greedy in the wineries and saw another increase of 1,000 yuan. Mung beans fell by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. The broad bean market was stable. In the oil market, goods from Qingdao were still available, and raw oil was still tired. Soybean oil was in short supply and still in demand. Vegetable oil was firm. Soybean cake from Taiwan was slightly inquired about for fertilizer. Raw cake from the South Ocean was also actively cleared.</p>
<h3 id="e127">Amidst the Spreading Surge - Silk Prices Are Also Being Driven Up - Medium Grade Exceeds 3 Million <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>In recent days, the black market for US dollars has been surging, and the raw silk market has also been affected by a big wave. From Monday to today, the average price of raw silk of all grades has risen by more than 20%. It is reported that the reason for the surge is: (1) Silk factories in various places have borrowed cocoon processing loans from China Sericulture Corporation for ABCDEF grades of raw silk, so all finished products above F grade are purchased by the Central Trust Bureau. It is also heard that China Sericulture Corporation is still continuing to handle cocoon processing loans, and the Central Bank's Central Trust Bureau, China Sericulture Corporation, and Raw Silk Inspection Institute will organize a Silk Export Committee to expand the purchase of raw silk and expand exports. Therefore, in the future, raw silk with new inspection certificates above F grade will not be easy to market, and the current inventory is also thin, that is, the number of medium-grade user raw silk below F grade is only about 2,000 dans. However, due to the start of real sales, silk factories are also greatly replenishing raw materials, and the appetite for medium-grade raw silk Sichuan households is strong. The holders are unanimously optimistic and firmly refuse to sell. (2) Due to various rumors favorable to raw silk, the psychology of the holders is more firm, so the buyers are more forceful in absorbing, mutually pushing up, soaring, so that the medium-grade raw silk protrudes from the 3 million yuan mark, creating the highest new record in nearly two months. According to industry insiders, if the international raw silk market is stable, the surge will be difficult to stop for a while.</p>

<h3 id="e129">Allocated Yarn Still Expected to Rise - Spinning &amp; Construction Cloth Prices Double - Tianjin Community's Route Mostly Transfers to Guandong - Foreign Cotton Still Settles at the Old Rate, Difficult to Fulfill Wishes <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>[Our Report] The yarn market is firmly grounded. When the market opened in the morning, people's hearts were still indifferent, and the quoted price was similar to yesterday's market. 42 counts of spot goods were priced at 2.84 million yuan, and 20 counts were priced at more than 1.8 million. Subsequently, due to the constant demand from all directions, the buying intention was strong, and the price rose frequently. The root cause is the odd shortage, continuous purchase, and frequent demand. The joint allocation and sales of the Spinning and Construction Company cannot be fully supplied, and the allocation price is rising period by period. The rightful demanders cannot get the appropriate amount of demand, and they have to search and purchase at high prices in the black market. Both 20 counts and 42 counts</p>
<h3 id="e130">Market Situation Gradually Stabilizes - Fried Red US Dollar Continues to Fall <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>Fried red was very stable yesterday. The market opened in the morning at around 2.17 million, and people's hearts were already tired. From 2.173 million, it gradually fell slightly, but there was a lot of struggle around 2.16 million. After 10 o'clock, the Central Bank allocated 400 bars at a price of 2.1625 million, and people's hearts finally became empty. Before noon, the price dropped sharply to a low of 2.145 million, and then it stabilized slightly. At noon, it stood at around 2.15 million. In the afternoon, the Guang community bought slightly. It was heard that the price of gold in Hong Kong rose, and the next-day transaction rose to 2.16 million. Later, because the US dollar was still weak, it was forced to retreat. As a result, it fell 12,000 yuan from the previous close. Ornamental gold, silver ingots, and silver dollars were all flat, and dark interest was still around 1.5%.</p>
<p>The foreign exchange US dollar also fell slightly, and the situation has stabilized. The market opened in the morning with a sale at 3,980 yuan. Although there were buyers after the opening, there was a whole batch waiting to be sold at the price of 4,000 yuan. Midway, it was difficult to retreat, and it turned stable at 3,900 yuan. At noon, it lingered around 3,950 yuan. In the afternoon, it was still flat at first, but finally fell slightly. As a result, it fell 50 yuan from the previous close. Hong Kong dollars were stable and changed little, hovering around 780 yuan. The result was the same as the previous close, but the buying price retreated by one level. Hong Kong exchange was also flat. Hong Kong China Electric recovered slightly. Yesterday, it was sold at 780 yuan. Indian exchange also retreated to 960 yuan for sale. British exchange was 12,500 yuan to 12,700 yuan. Although the US exchange rate was flat, there was no action. 34,000. Because the 16 counts had risen too sharply in recent days and had exceeded the price of 20 counts, yesterday was still calm. In the afternoon, the market situation was still firm, because the search from all sides was relentless, and the price also rose. It was heard that the 42 counts order had been priced at more than 2.8 million, and the 20 counts were even more firm. Private yarn factories, in view of the strong real sales, had high thoughts and requested the authorities to relax. According to authoritative news, there are still tens of thousands of pieces of calico that were allocated before the exchange rate change, and they requested settlement at the old rate. However, due to the trend of the situation, it is feared that they will not be able to fulfill their wishes, so the price of allocated yarn may have to rise again.</p>
<p>In the cloth market, except for 3A calico, which opened at 84,000 yuan, and Four Gentlemen old goods, which opened at 100,000 yuan, the transactions of various colored cloths were still lively. When the Spinning and Construction Company opened 20 counts of unbranded calico and suddenly rose to 66,000 yuan, and unbranded calico rose to 77,000 yuan, each rose by nearly 10,000. White printed drill opened at 92,000 yuan, and Shuiyue Shilin opened at 120,000 yuan. The former rose by 114,000 yuan compared to the previous period, and the latter rose by tens of thousands. After this influence, there was a random shout, and the price finally rose by 2,000 to 3,000 yuan. Subsequently, because the price of goods was too high, real sales temporarily stopped, and it became sluggish. It was heard that the route of the Tianjin community has been the most prosperous in recent days, and most of them are transferred to the nine provinces of the East, of which the red cloth has reached more than 30,000 pieces.</p>

<p>China stocks had few buyers yesterday. Even if there were advances from the Guang and North communities, the number was not large and was easily overwhelmed by floating longs. After seeing a low opening, they failed to recover. After the opening, they showed a slight firmness, but were soon overwhelmed. Under the widespread liquidation, they gradually became tired. There were few twists and turns in the middle, and the transaction volume also appeared idle. After 11:30, the shorts began to cover their positions. If the financial community, such as China Trust No. 44, purchased Mayar, the Guang community also slightly accepted yarn factories, and once showed show, but when the market closed, the North community made some settlements, and the Guang community also sold the company, and it became weak again. As a result, Yongsha, Jingfu, Xinguang, and Qinxing each fell by about half a percent compared to the previous close. Mayar fell slightly. Among the cold stocks, Zhongtong and Jinglun fell slightly. Zhongfang, Rongfeng, underwear, silk, Huafeng, and Wuhe fell by half or so. Xinhe, Datong, Xinya Company, Lianan Matches, and Cement each fell by about 10%. The total transaction volume was more than 7.76 million shares, and the off-market stocks also brought a small amount.</p>

<p>The white coal market continues to advance towards the peak. Buyers are all watching because of the high price, so the actual transaction volume is limited, and the price is extremely chaotic. The Hongji lump coal of more than 800 tons purchased by the Coal Business Joint Office has been recently transported with the permission of the Fuel Committee. The shareholders' meeting will be held on the 7th of this month to discuss the price and allocation method. The high-quality bituminous coal Huai continued to rise slightly, and the charcoal also rose due to the rise in white coal.</p>

<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 25th] The Pacific Relations Research Institute's publication "Far Eastern Review" contains an article by an American businessman named Stevens who has just returned from China. It states that the Chinese government's economic policy is currently discouraging foreign investors and private enterprises in China. This policy is mostly from the hand of Executive Yuan President Song Ziwen. Stevens said: "The Nanjing government is establishing government-controlled companies to compete with private industry." He predicts that the government's "bureaucratic capital" will eventually occupy all important industries outside of the communist areas.</p>
<h3 id="e140">On the Huai River (5) <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent Shao Shenzhi</p>
<p>Bengbu, 14th</p>
<p>The true state of the Huai River region is like a pair of tossed plates, with water and the flames of war stirred into a single mass.</p>
<p>The night train to Bengbu on the Jinpu Railway arrives late at night. In Bengbu, a cannon blast at 11:30 PM marks the beginning of curfew. After midnight, travelers are not allowed to enter the city and are forced to spend the night at the station. A flashlight reveals a sea of people, their deep island slumber punctuated by snores in the autumn dew. The lamplight is dim, and the shadows of war loom all around.</p>
<p>A railway man confided in me, lamenting how easily they are harassed by soldiers. For the past half-year, wherever the troops pass, almost every station has witnessed a full-blown conflict. He himself has been beaten. Just a few days ago, the stationmaster of Lingjiaqiao, south of Su County, received a thorough thrashing. The reason is simple: they cannot accept the commanding requests of these soldiers and junior officers. These demands are often ridiculous and violate common sense regarding railway operations, such as issuing waybills immediately or preventing later passenger trains from departing first. The Military Affairs Commission's order that "soldiers must not interfere with the stationmaster's authority over railway operations" is ineffective. Unless each stationmaster has a colonel's insignia and a pistol, they will immediately stand at attention and offer no resistance, forgetting their itching fists. This is much more effective than reasoning.</p>
<p>Meeting with Xia Wei</p>
<p>Xia Wei, commander of the Eighth Pacification Zone, is a general from the Northern Expedition who defended southern Guangxi during the Anti-Japanese War, earning military merits. He is now stationed in Bengbu. When I returned from Zhengyangguan, I sent my card to visit him. He gladly received me and humbly said, "I do not know much, but I am willing to answer to the best of my knowledge."</p>
<p>Our conversation lasted only 20 minutes, but within the military scope, I gained an outline of the situation in Anhui Province and two conclusions.</p>
<p>(1) All counties in Anhui Province are now under government control. Some places were once "liberated areas," but most were not. In those former "liberated areas," armed forces are still harassing the National Army. Elsewhere, some claiming to be Communist troops are also active. The local situation is mostly unstable. Those claiming to be Communist troops are actually bandits. If the Communist Party uses them, they become Communist troops. Xia Wei concluded, "A bandit is a bandit. Just because the Communist Party uses them does not mean they are no longer bandits, or that claiming to be Communist troops makes them no longer bandits."</p>
<p>(2) Regarding Li Xiannian's forces, he said, "Three thousand men are fleeing towards central Anhui, but due to casualties along the way, only a little over a thousand will be able to cross the Huainan Railway and reach northern Jiangsu." Beyond that, he could not confirm that any other Communist troops had passed through Anhui Province. However, Communist troops are still present in western Anhui, namely Zhang Tixue's forces. He admitted this, but said, "Only a few hundred men."</p>
<p>I had learned that a part of the Communist forces had passed through Yingshan, via Sanhejian, crossed the Ying River, and reached the outskirts of Xuzhou. His subordinates told me, "They were originally bandits who later became part of Li Xiannian's Communist forces, and now they are not anymore, only a few hundred men."</p>
<p>Extended Talk with the Commissioner</p>
<p>Communist troops, those claiming to be Communist troops, those claiming to be Communist troops acknowledged by the Communist Party, puppet troops incorporated by the Communist Party, bandits who claim nothing, bandits who were originally bandits and then quit the Communist forces, former puppet troops waiting for reorganization who refused to join... The National Army controls the cities and transportation routes. Elsewhere, armed forces of unclear identity are constantly active, and all sides tend to call them Communist troops uniformly. Anhui local newspapers also frequently publish news of "Communist troops harassing everywhere," and the result is naturally fighting everywhere. The outcome of the battles? That is a question of no importance.</p>
<p>Here are some recent "military updates," which illustrate the difficulties faced by the Anhui government: 1. The Communist Army's Independent Regiment Commander from western Guilin, with over a thousand men, infiltrated Taihu from Qianshan; a part of them, over six hundred, have retreated back to Biaolin River in Qianshan. 2. Zhang Tixue's forces, approximately five hundred men, harassed Chen Han in Susong County, and after being intercepted, fled to Qiujia Mountain in Huangmei. 3. Liu Xianzheng, commander of the Communist Army's Jiangbei Brigade, recently led over eight hundred men from Jiangnan to Qi Tou Zui, Baishi Mountain, and Yin Ping Mountain in Wu and Fu Counties, engaging in activities. 4. Over twenty thousand defeated Communist troops from north of Lingbi and along the Tuo River have been conscripting thousands of laborers daily in Chenchangji and Shiji, building pontoon bridges and constructing fortifications. 5. Wei Fenglou's Communist forces, with Wu Youshou, Jin Shaoshan, and others, totaling over eight thousand men, infiltrated Hao County from Dacheng, Zhecheng, and other places in eastern Henan, cutting off the Shangqiu-Bozhou highway.</p>
<p>The Fourth Administrative Region of Anhui Province, including Mengcheng, Huaiyuan, Wuhe, Siyang, and Lingbi counties, is experiencing the heaviest fighting and suffering the greatest hardships. It is necessary to hear the voices of local officials. The Commissioner's Office is in Su County. I went to Su County to see Commissioner Liao Ziying, and we had a long conversation in the quiet Commissioner's Office. He pointed northeast and southwest, saying, "There are Communist troops there."</p>
<p>"It is hard to be an honest official, and impossible to be a corrupt one." The 59-year-old commissioner said with emotion. He is from Fengtai County, graduated from the Anhui Military Academy during the Guangxu era, and was a brigade commander during the Northern Expedition. He was transferred from southern Anhui this July.</p>
<p>Impression of the Commissioner's Office</p>
<p>The weather was very hot during our conversation, and we were sweating. He said it was good that it was hot because it would help the crops grow strong. He heard that firewood was needed for cooking, and here it costs 100 yuan per catty, but the military only pays 5 yuan, the prescribed price. Each person needs at least two catties per day, which is only ten yuan. I couldn't help but ask, "How do you make up for the difference?" He raised his head and stared at the beam above, not saying a word. Then he stood up and pointed out the window, saying to me that the building next door was a middle school that couldn't open. "At a meeting the day before yesterday, we found that over one hundred and eighty desks and benches were missing." So he sat down to drink some tea, sighed deeply, and said, "Weapons are tools of destruction. There are no soldiers in the world who do not disturb the people. This thing is extremely destructive. The country should not resort to military force unless absolutely necessary. To be fair, military discipline is not as good as during the Anti-Japanese War!"</p>
<p>The salary for staff in the Commissioner's Office is 180 yuan, plus a living subsidy of 35,000 yuan, nothing else. Eating two meals of corn buns and congee a day costs 37,500 yuan. The orderly gets 17,500 yuan, which is not enough to eat. The salary is only 32 yuan, which is incredibly low. They don't have clothes or shoes. The Commissioner's Office's public expenses are 32,000 yuan per month, and travel expenses are 17,600 yuan. Postage alone costs over 10,000 yuan a month. There are no telegrams. A bucket of kerosene costs tens of thousands of yuan, not to mention paper, ink, and brushes.</p>
<p>"I told Chairman Li that the inspectors are unnecessary. 17,600 yuan is not enough for a single field trip. Now, if we want to send people out to inspect, we will inevitably disturb the local people." Regarding grassroots politics, he said, "The commissioner's responsibility is not as great as the township head's. The township head is responsible for everything: people's property, construction, education, and grain. Today's township head is not afraid of the county magistrate, only the court. But the court doesn't care about bad people, only good people. Anhui has trained 100,000 local cadres. If they were of one heart and mind, these people could naturally control the county magistrate from above and educate the people from below. But what can you get from three months of training? They wear good clothes, but the result is that they do more bad things than good things."</p>
<p>He told me that he was the county magistrate of Guoyang County for a year during the Anti-Japanese War, and Peng Xuefeng's Communist troops came to engage in a united front. "It was truly a year of knives against knives and guns against guns! I told Peng Xuefeng, 'Don't come to Guoyang to cause trouble. If I were a corrupt official who deserved to be shot, that would be one thing. Otherwise, if you come and cause trouble, I will fight. He couldn't do anything to me.'" As a result, after he left office a year later, the twenty-seven townships in Guoyang County were completely transformed. He concluded, "The human factor is very important."</p>
<p>Now, there are several thousand demobilized youth troops in Su County. The county wants to assign them as township guards, but they all refuse, yet they stay there receiving money and eating. The local area bears over one million yuan per month. Commissioner Liao said that it is really not easy to establish township offices in Wuhe, Si County, and Lingbi. It is a matter of life and death. Communist troops in plain clothes are still ambushing everywhere. Are those with any ability willing to do it? But those without ability cannot handle it. So, the old commissioner shook his head again.</p>
<p>For dinner, we had congee, corn buns, and four bowls of plain vegetable stew, without any oil: greens, mung bean sprouts, greens stir-fried with tofu skin, and a plate of green chili peppers. Because there were guests at noon, the commissioner had added two meat dishes. There was still some left over for dinner. I was invited to sit down, and after we finished eating, the commissioner asked the orderly to take the bowl of unfinished stir-fried sauce upstairs to save for another meal.</p>
<p>Relief Work</p>
<p>Relief work here is quite tense. The branch office is located in Wuhu, and the Bengbu office is an outpost. Half of the staff of the branch are on the road. In Bengbu, I saw Deputy Director Ke Yufu, who said, "The work in northern Anhui is very important. UNRRA will also come here to set up an office. We are looking for a building." He summarized the work of the branch office up to the end of August, providing a detailed explanation including livelihood, hygiene, storage and transportation, agriculture, industry, and recent plans.</p>
<p>Under the item of livelihood, there are two parts: "relief" and "work relief." The scope of "work relief" is very broad, including repairing dikes and dams, dredging rivers and blocking breaches, repairing school buildings, organizing cleaning teams, running sewing factories, and even renovating the roads in Wuhu and Bengbu. This is practically construction work, which inevitably reminds one of Roosevelt's Blue Eagle. Even now, relief work is material for political battles. In his report, under the "relief" item, he placed "promoting relief in Communist areas" on the same level as "sending refugees back to their hometowns, handling emergency relief in northern Anhui, providing relief to refugees along the Jinpu Railway, distributing old clothes and shoes, and establishing milk and flour stations." I couldn't help but ask, "Is there any bias?"</p>
<p>Deputy Director Ke said, "Relief work should not be divided by boundaries or political factions. The Anhui branch has specifically organized a work team for the northeastern Anhui area to go deep into Communist areas to carry out relief work, distributing over one hundred tons of flour, as well as old clothes, medicine, and milk powder. Team leader Huang Jinheng, along with Father Hua of the Bengbu Catholic Church and Drane, went to distribute these items. Recently, another 1,000 tons of flour were allocated to fifteen counties in northeastern Anhui, with Director Fu of our office responsible for supervising the distribution." He added, "We have no bias. Military actions have hindered us, but we will continue to go to Communist areas to do our work." However, once the war starts, the Communist Party's strategic requirement is to completely destroy all transportation lines behind the National Army. If necessary, they will breach the dikes to rely on water for defense, which goes against the work of the UNRRA. So the propaganda war plays out, with accusations flying. However, the Fei River estuary north of Fengyang County has been silted up for a long time, harming farmland. Using work relief, over 50,000 cubic meters of earth were removed, saving over 400,000 mu of farmland. This area is what the UNRRA calls the Communist area.</p>
<p>Thrilling Encounter</p>
<p>However, I still suspected whether they were biased and only doing a little bit of window-dressing on the surface. Huang Jinheng, the team leader of the work team for northeastern Anhui, gave me a very detailed explanation, recounting his thrilling work experience. He said:</p>
<p>In order to carry out work in the Communist area of northeastern Anhui, at the end of June, we contacted Zhou Enlai in Nanjing. He strongly approved and gave us a certificate and route instructions. We went to Huaiyin to contact the leaders of the Jiangsu-Anhui border government. We immediately took the route through Yangzhou and Shaobo and entered the Communist area, meeting with the commander of their military region in central China and the Minister of Health. Because of the military tension, the leaders of the border government were all in the countryside, but we finally met Vice Chairman Wei Pengdan. After discussions, it was agreed that a group would be formed with one representative each from the Communist Party, the branch office, and UNRRA, to decide on: (1) basing things on work relief, constructing the Huai dike, from Linhuai Pass to the Wuhe section. This project would be the responsibility of the Dike Restoration Engineering Bureau, increasing the amount of flour distributed (according to the regulations of the Dike Restoration Bureau, each cubic meter of earth receives two to four catties of flour) to comply with their policies. At the same time, (2) constructing the Hong Lake Dam, seventy-some li within Anhui, with the Anhui branch responsible for funding. (3) Dredging the Si River. (4) There are over 50,000 fishermen in Hongze Lake who have no fish to catch in the winter, needing relief. (5) In terms of hygiene, malaria, kala-azar, summer infectious diseases, and skin diseases are very common, needing medicine. Various places have "People's Hospitals," but they are only signs, lacking actual work.</p>
<p>After reaching the above conclusions, we returned to Wuhu from Huaiyin to report. We first transported nutritional supplies and medicines to meet urgent needs, including milk powder, penicillin, yellow and white petroleum jelly, DDT, summer vaccines, quinine, etc., over two hundred boxes. On July 28th, we hired a large wooden boat and set off eastward, with Zhuang Tongli from UNRRA accompanying us. After crossing Linhuai Pass for twenty li, we were strictly inspected. This was the first checkpoint. We showed them the certificates from Zhou Enlai and the border government. The response was that we could go ahead, but it was dangerous. Every seven or eight li, someone would inspect us, questioning us in detail. In some places, they even wanted to detain us. Fighting was taking place in Wuhe. When we arrived in Wuhe, the Communist troops had retreated, so we continued to Xuyi amid the shelling. The retreating Communist troops wanted the boat to cross the river and fired at the boat, seeing Zhuang Tongli wearing khaki clothes and thinking he was part of the Central Army, threatening us with hand grenades. We used all our persuasive skills, and every two or three li we were shot at. We finally arrived at Shuanggou in the evening. Gunfire was heard everywhere, and then there was another inspection by people from the Water Police Bureau. Seeing the foreigner's goods, they liked everything and wanted to take everything. The Communist troops had established the Sinan County government here. The next day, we went ashore, but their people had all fled. We only found their county magistrate through a local canal owner. They knew that we had supplies to deliver, and at this time, it was a period of military action. We held a meeting on the boat with their local representatives, who issued receipts, and we handed over the two hundred boxes of supplies to them.</p>
<p>That's how they ended a period of wandering. Leaving the Communist area was like entering no man's land, with no inspections. Back in Mingguang (Photo by Shao Shenzhi)</p>

<p>Gentlemen: Let an unfortunate person tell you about the pain of dropping out of school. Because of his family's financial situation, he does not have the means to pay the huge tuition fees, so he has to drop out of school. Watching so many classmates go to school with their schoolbags (they are happy), he is abandoned outside the school gate. He does not have the courage to ask the principal to enroll him, and he dare not step into the school gate because there are many mocking eyes searching for this kind of unfortunate person! The alma mater is lovely, but he cannot return to its embrace! Classmates are approachable, but he has no right to study with them. Teachers are respectable, but he cannot face them in the classroom. Gentlemen, can the unfortunate man attribute this pain of dropping out of school to God's anger? Or to the palm of fate? Many unfortunate dropouts are eagerly awaiting your generosity! (Hu Sihe)</p>

<p>Editor: Recently, the issue of returning principal a thousandfold for fixed deposits has been hotly debated. I know that laws have been explained long ago. In my opinion, fixed deposits have better credibility, and banks account for the majority. It is best that each bank automatically determines a fair method, or returns the same amount of stocks based on the stock market price of the bank when the deposit was made. Depositors who do not want to be shareholders can transfer the stocks themselves. This method takes care of both sides, but the procedures may be quite troublesome. I hope experts will discuss this. Respectfully yours, Shenbao (Chen Xinzhong)</p>

<p>Reply to Jiang Yingjie: According to the reply from the Great China Rubber Factory to our newspaper, "The regulations for purchasing tires are intended for practical users, to prevent speculators from buying them all up. Now, the Public Utilities Bureau has canceled the issuance of permits on behalf of rickshaw companies for three-wheeled vehicles (i.e., Xingji Company), and the vehicle owners can pick them up themselves. Rickshaw companies retain vehicle licenses. As far as we know, receipts have always been issued, and they can also be used to purchase tires at our retail outlets. There is no inconvenience. If you do not have even this, it is clear that you are trying to buy tires without owning a vehicle, intending to resell them for profit. In addition to replying separately to Mr. Jiang, we hereby reply."</p>
<p>Reply to Ai Jue: We received a reply from the Municipal Engineering Bureau stating: "Regarding the matter of filling in the harbor and building roads at Fahua Harbor, this bureau has had road planning since 1936, but has not yet started construction due to limited funds. The rest is under the jurisdiction of the Public Utilities Bureau."</p>
<p>Reply to Li Jinmin and a resident of Kangjia Bridge: According to a letter from the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau: "(1) This city has been using red, yellow, and green traffic lights for a long time, but the number is still small. This bureau is currently designing to convert all traffic lights on the main roads of the central district, such as Nanjing Road and Zhongzheng East Road, to three-color automatic lights to facilitate control. However, the cost of this equipment is very high. If the budget for installing lights next year can be approved, the conversion should be no problem. (2) Regarding the request to remove the four barbed wire fences near 40 Fanhuangdu Road, this has been forwarded to the Engineering Bureau."</p>

<p>Medicine and Hygiene</p>
<p>(1) Tinnitus and Hearing Loss</p>
<p>Qian Shende asks: I have recently been suffering from tinnitus. It doesn't sound when I'm still, but it "hangs" when I'm moving. My spirit and appetite are normal, but it affects my hearing. I have a history of otitis media and already have hearing loss, so it is now even more impaired. After examination, the ears are fine, and it is suspected to be caused by constipation. I have tried to clear my bowels, but there has been no improvement. I have also consulted an internist who said it is neurasthenia. Please advise on treatment methods.</p>
<p>[Answer from Dr. Tang Renjin, Medical Doctor] It is not a middle ear disorder but middle ear sclerosis. An otolaryngology specialist must examine the eardrum to see if there are any perforations, check for nasal disease, and conduct hearing tests to determine the diagnosis and provide treatment.</p>
<p>(2) Kidney Inflammation</p>
<p>Yan Ruxian asks: My father is sixty-six years old. Three years ago, he suffered from hematuria, which occurred intermittently, but there was no pain and he did not feel any lower back pain. However, he does not want to drink tea, and the number of times he urinates at night has increased, while the amount of urine has decreased. The doctor said that the disease is in the kidneys, it is not easy to treat, and rest is best. In April this year, his feet became swollen after standing for a long time. The swelling did not subside, and the swelling has gradually increased over the past two months. Currently, the swelling has spread to the legs and lower body. How can I relieve the swelling? How can I cure it?</p>
<p>[Answer from Dr. Tang Renjin, Medical Doctor] Immediately examine the urine to determine if there is kidney inflammation. The main principle of kidney inflammation patients is to limit the intake of water, salt, and protein to promote the reduction of edema. Which medicines to take must be determined by an internal medicine doctor after examination.</p>

<p>Patients Among Young People and Laborers are Most Vulnerable</p>
<p>Editor: Recently, I have seen a surge in the number of inquiries about lung disease in various newspaper mailboxes, which shows the rampant nature of tuberculosis bacteria and the increasing number of patients every day, which is a matter of great concern! Chinese people have always been known as the "sick men of East Asia." This city is densely populated, and the disease is extremely contagious. Most patients are young people and laborers. Once infected, it is a terminal illness. Once in the second or third stage, they are left to die. Both Chinese and Western doctors are helpless. I recently visited a sanatorium and saw a continuous stream of people coming for full-body checkups and X-rays, costing more than 10,000 yuan each time. The working class and the general poor can only sigh at the high costs! I hope that hospitals can give preferential treatment to poor patients on holidays, providing free X-ray examinations of the lungs, to promote the welfare of the poor and laborers. This is essential for strengthening the country and the race. I also hope that the municipal health authorities will promote the eradication of tuberculosis, so that this terrible infectious bacteria is not easily spread, which would be a great blessing to the citizens. I sincerely hope that the above opinions will be disclosed. Respectfully, Zhao Liu Shang</p>

<h3 id="e149">Combating Incompetent Doctors and Fake Medicine <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>— Zhang Ming</p>
<p>The following news item was published in the Dagong Bao of this city on the 16th of this month:</p>
<p>"On the 14th, a comedic scene unfolded at the Chongqing Municipal Hospital, where Chinese and Western doctors engaged in an on-the-spot 'battle of skills.' It began when a Chinese medicine practitioner named Shi Danshu repeatedly placed large advertisements in various newspapers and periodicals, claiming to have invented a 'pulse diagnosis for lung diseases' that was unfailingly accurate. The Municipal Health Bureau, finding this claim extraordinary, ordered Dr. Shi to conduct a clinical experiment at the Municipal Hospital at 5 p.m. on the 14th. Two hospitalized patients, Zhang Yifu and Ren Zhengqiang, were brought out for him to diagnose. After taking their pulses, Shi concluded that Zhang Yifu had stage three lung disease with tubercles between the first and second ribs of his left lung, a cavity in his right lung, and decaying lower end; Ren Zhengqiang was in the late stage two of lung disease, with a cavity in his left lung and tuberculosis in his right lung. Subsequently, Chen Siyi, the section chief of the Health Bureau, instructed doctors at the Municipal Hospital to take the two patients to the X-ray room for fluoroscopy. This proved that Zhang Yifu's lungs were normal and healthy, and Ren Zhengqiang had only one calcified spot on the upper end of his right lung. This diagnosis was entirely inconsistent with Shi Danshu's findings. When Chief Chen asked Shi to explain the discrepancy, Shi Danshu was greatly embarrassed and in a state of utter discomfiture. The Health Bureau has ordered Shi Danshu to cease his business operations, stop publishing advertisements, and await investigation and punishment."</p>
<p>In the present era, where advertisements for incompetent doctors and fake medicines are rampant, this news is as refreshing as a cooling powder, bringing a sense of great satisfaction. The Chongqing Municipal Health Bureau did not adhere to the primary rule of bureaucracy – "it's better to do less than more" – nor did it dismiss this as a "minor matter." Instead, they handled the situation in a scientific, decisive, and fair manner. We express our respect to the Chongqing Municipal Health Bureau.</p>
<p>In Shanghai, countless swindlers masquerade as doctors, treating patients' lives as a game. Regardless of whether a patient is ill or not, or whether the treatment is appropriate, they perform unnecessary surgeries to line their pockets. Among the advertising doctors, how many truly prioritize medical ethics and service? How many do not treat medicine as a business, putting money ahead of service? As for medicine, fake and inferior drugs flood the market, and some cunning pharmaceutical companies are even given certificates of approval by the health authorities, enabling them to publish deceptive advertisements in newspapers.</p>
<p>In the freest countries like the United States and England, unethical medical advertising is also subject to government prohibition because medicine affects the health of the people and the future of the nation, it cannot be treated as ordinary commerce and ordinary commodities.</p>
<p>It is hoped that the health authorities in this city will quickly catch up, strictly crack down on incompetent doctors and fake medicine, and protect the health of citizens.</p>
<h3 id="e150">Tetanus <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>— Qian De</p>
<p>Its Pathogen and Prevention</p>
<p>Tetanus is a systemic toxemic condition caused by the exotoxins of tetanus bacilli infecting wounds. It is a serious infectious disease that is difficult to treat once contracted, but relatively easy to prevent, and the effect of prevention is very good. To understand how tetanus bacilli infect wounds and cause symptoms, we must first have some knowledge of the bacteria. They normally exist in the feces of cattle, horses, and humans. Once excreted, they exist in a spore state and are very resistant, immune to sunlight and ordinary drugs. Therefore, the bacteria contaminate everywhere, especially fields fertilized with feces, and any wound, whether from a gunshot, laceration, or even a splinter from glass, wire, or wood, or a small needle prick, can be infected if there is a break in the skin. The larger the wound, the greater the possibility of infection. Once infected, the bacteria remain localized.</p>
<p>The symptoms are produced entirely by the exotoxins produced by the bacteria, which travel through nerves, blood, and lymph vessels to the central nervous system, causing stimulation. Exotoxins are only produced in the absence of resistance. Therefore, although the bacteria normally exist in the sun or on the surface of the body and cause no harm, in a wound, the necrotic tissue provides the bacteria with more nutrients. If there is a mixed infection of pyogenic bacteria, which consumes oxygen and weakens the body’s defense – phagocytes – it allows the bacteria to thrive. Therefore, it can be said that the larger and deeper the wound, the more suitable it is for the bacteria to survive. Conversely, even if the wound is small, if bacteria are inoculated deep into the tissue, it can also cause harm. In addition, it is also possible for bacteria to be introduced through the incision during surgery (including illegal abortions), or for bacteria that were already present in a dormant state in an old wound to be reactivated by surgery, or for newborns to be infected during old-fashioned deliveries when unsterilized scissors are used to cut the umbilical cord.</p>
<p>Tetanus symptoms usually appear a few days to two or three weeks after infection, by which time the wound may have healed. The earliest symptoms are difficulty chewing, opening the mouth, and swallowing, followed by rigidity and contraction of the back and abdominal muscles, and opisthotonos. Minor stimulation and tremors can cause paroxysmal painful contractions of the muscles, leading to death within hours to one or two weeks from respiratory or heart failure or exhaustion. The most distressing thing is that the patient remains fully conscious.</p>
<p>However, the timing of the onset and outcome of the disease depends on the nature and location of the injury and whether preventive injections have been given. Generally, injuries to the head and face or infections in newborns result in earlier symptoms, poorer prognosis, and a mortality rate of over 95%. Those who have received preventive injections and appropriate medical treatment may not develop symptoms until one or two months later, and the symptoms may be chronic or localized. The outcomes in these cases are generally good. In general, if a patient survives for a week after the onset of symptoms, the chances of recovery increase with each passing day. Based on the above description, we can see that tetanus is a terrible disease, but its terribleness can be greatly reduced by prevention. The following are essential points to note:</p>
<p>(1) Do not use old-fashioned midwives for delivery.</p>
<p>(2) Pay attention to skin cleanliness and protect it properly to prevent tetanus bacilli from entering the tissue.</p>
<p>(3) For first aid in case of bleeding, flush the wound with tap water or cooled boiled water, and then apply sterile gauze. Do not sprinkle ashes or mud on the wound.</p>
<p>(4) Wounds should be treated in a hospital. Clean the wound, remove any foreign debris, and excise any dead tissue. Open the wound as much as possible and irrigate with oxidizing agents.</p>
<p>(5) Children and soldiers who are prone to injury should be injected with tetanus toxoid, two injections three weeks apart, to produce active immunity in the body. After an injury, give one booster shot to increase their resistance. If they have not received this preventive injection, they should be given antitoxin immediately after an injury, just in case.</p>
<p>(6) If tetanus symptoms have already appeared, send the patient to the hospital for treatment immediately.</p>
<h3 id="e151">Everyone Should Have Knowledge of Tuberculosis Prevention <a href="#e151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>— Xu Changwen</p>
<p>Regarding tuberculosis prevention, there are at least two aspects to discuss: first, how to prevent patients with tuberculosis bacilli in their sputum from infecting healthy people; and second, how to enable early detection and early treatment of patients with early-stage tuberculosis, so that they do not progress to an aggravated and incurable state.</p>
<p>The first point is what most people consider tuberculosis prevention, including emphasizing personal hygiene, prohibiting spitting anywhere, isolating patients' food and drink, disinfecting tableware, keeping patients away from public places, and establishing sanatoriums, etc. Everyone knows this, but it is not effectively implemented. Perhaps the knowledge is not thorough enough, so the author will explain it here. Usually, there are many tuberculosis patients who, although suffering from stage two or stage three tuberculosis, can still move around with some difficulty, but their sputum must contain tuberculosis bacilli. If they spit anywhere, the tuberculosis bacilli in the sputum may fly in the dust after the sputum dries and be inhaled into the trachea by others, thus causing tuberculosis. Patients' food and utensils must be isolated from others. It is best to eat alone. However, if the environment does not allow it and they want to share a table with others, they must use sanitary chopsticks; at the same time, the bowls and chopsticks used by patients should be boiled in hot water for five minutes to prevent indirect transmission. When coughing, patients should turn away from others and cover their mouth and nose tightly with a handkerchief to avoid the splashing of sputum droplets and infecting others. Ordinary coughing in the sunlight can be seen spitting out one or two yards away. This distance is definitely beyond what most people can imagine. Even when patients talk, they should be at least ten feet away from ordinary people. The establishment of sanatoriums is for the treatment of patients on the one hand, and for isolating them from the outside world and preventing transmission on the other hand.</p>
<p>The second point is often overlooked by ordinary people, and this is what the author intends to particularly remind. At present, before effective drugs have been truly invented, the best principles for preventing and treating tuberculosis are "early detection and early treatment." Usually, people think that once they cough up blood, they suspect that they have tuberculosis, but there are also many cases where there are no symptoms of coughing up blood and they are already in stage two or even stage three tuberculosis. Therefore, to detect it early, we must pay attention to the early symptoms of tuberculosis that are often overlooked by ordinary people, such as easy fatigue, weight loss, etc. Once discovered, they should immediately undergo fluoroscopy of the lungs. It is even safer for ordinary people to have fluoroscopy once every three months, for a total of four times a year. The cost of such fluoroscopy is extremely low, even common laborers can afford it. If the results of four examinations are healthy, then they can be comfortable in body and mind for a year. If someone's lungs are clear in March and June, but black spots or unclear areas are found in September, then the scope of their lesions must be small, because the progression of tuberculosis is mostly slow, and the interval is only two or three months. If they can seize the opportunity and immediately follow the detailed guidance of a doctor and receive appropriate treatment, the results are often very good. Even if the lesions are found to be enlarged and spreading, compression therapy can be used to suppress them and achieve a nearly complete cure.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if a patient coughs up blood or has a severe cough and seeks medical attention, and after the doctor's diagnosis and medication, the symptoms gradually subside. If the patient mistakenly believes that the disease has been cured and ignores the changes in the lesions, and then seeks medical attention after the second and third relapses, then the lesions in the lungs have often spread or have ulcerated into cavities, and the patient's body is weak. At this time, even if the doctor tries his best to treat, the effect is difficult to determine, and the result is a waste of effort. If saved, the patient has suffered both mental anguish and economic loss.</p>
<p>Therefore, in addition to passively preventing the spread of sputum, we should also actively pay attention to the evolution of lesions, and "early detection and early treatment" is the only compass to avoid falling into the abyss of incurability.</p>
<h3 id="e152">Hemoptysis (Coughing Up Blood) <a href="#e152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>— Police Officer Hao</p>
<p>If you have always been in good health and one day suddenly discover that your sputum contains blood, you will definitely feel very surprised and depressed, and immediately go to a doctor. Seeing a doctor is what you should do, but feeling alarmed and despondent is unnecessary, because this may even be your good fortune. The doctor may diagnose that you have a little tuberculosis in your lungs, and it is not difficult to treat it early. If it were not for the blood in your sputum, you would never have gone to see a doctor, so the disease may have progressed to a serious degree without your knowledge.</p>
<p>Among tuberculosis patients, those who cough up blood account for 50% to 90%. However, coughing up blood is not only caused by tuberculosis. Other chest diseases that can cause this symptom include: (1) pulmonary sclerosis, (2) mitral stenosis, (3) pertussis, bronchitis, pulmonary emphysema and other diseases with severe coughs, (4) chest trauma, (5) bronchopneumonia, lobar pneumonia, (6) pulmonary cysts, (7) bronchiectasis, (8) pulmonary infarction, (9) pulmonary tumors, pulmonary mycosis, pulmonary syphilis, (10) pulmonary fungal diseases such as candidiasis, etc., (11) aortic aneurysm rupturing into the lungs, (12) liver abscess or other abscesses rupturing into the lungs, (13) pulmonary parasitic diseases such as echinococcosis, paragonimiasis, etc.</p>
<p>Coughing up blood must be distinguished from vomiting blood, nosebleeds, and bleeding caused by oral cavity diseases. In addition, diseases of the blood itself, such as hemophilia, leukemia, purpura, and pernicious anemia, can also cause bloody sputum.</p>
<p>Bleeding from tuberculosis can be divided into two types: one type is caused by rupture of blood vessels, for example, blood vessels in tuberculous cavities in the lungs form aneurysms, and rupture of the aneurysms can cause a large amount of coughing up blood; the other type is caused by pathological changes in the walls of blood vessels that cause allergic reactions, increasing their permeability, so that blood plasma and blood cells are easily exuded. This type of bleeding is often very slight.</p>
<p>Finding the cause of coughing up blood and treating bleeding are the doctor's business. What the patient should pay attention to is, first, absolute bed rest, inhibiting coughing, and avoiding panic. Too much movement, coughing, and panic can increase blood pressure and prevent the wound from healing, so the bleeding cannot stop. Remember: only one or two out of a hundred cases die directly from coughing up blood, so fear is unnecessary. The doctor's first treatment for coughing up blood is to administer sedatives and antitussives, and use a chest bandage to reduce local blood flow and reduce chest movement. The use of hemostatic agents is still controversial. In suitable cases, artificial pneumothorax to stop the bleeding can have miraculous effects. Blood transfusions and surgery are sometimes necessary. In terms of diet, it is best to eat soft or liquid foods when the bleeding is severe, and cold foods are preferable. The patient should not do it himself, but should be fed by family members or nurses.</p>
<p>Finally, the author would like to correct a misconception: that many people believe that sputum with blood streaks is more serious than coughing up large amounts of blood, but in fact, there is no difference in the severity of the condition between tuberculosis patients who cough up blood and those who do not cough up blood. In today's China, where tuberculosis is rampant, we should suspect that anyone who coughs up blood or has blood streaks in their sputum has tuberculosis, unless it is determined after detailed examination that they are not tuberculous. We should keep in mind that tuberculosis is the biggest cause of coughing up blood.</p>

<p>— Qiao Shumin</p>
<p>Excerpted from "Infectious Disease Management" (3) Susceptibility and Resistance</p>
<p>(2) Specific Resistance—Immunity</p>
<p>In addition to the aforementioned ordinary resistance, we can also have a so-called specific resistance to a certain disease in order to resist a certain specific bacterium. For example, if we suffer from typhoid fever, then our body produces a substance that can have a certain antagonistic reaction with typhoid bacilli or their products. This substance that stimulates antagonistic substances is called "antigen." Antigens are colloidal substances, mostly composed of protein components and their haptens, and the antibodies they stimulate are all unique. For example, various antitoxins, agglutinins, precipitins, bacteriophages, anti-aggressins, lysins, cytotoxins, defensins (complement) are all antibodies, and each has its own uniqueness.</p>
<p>(3) Secondary Factors Related to Resistance:</p>
<p>It is impossible to set a normal standard for resistance to infectious diseases, because in each stage of life, in different natural environments, all nutrients, fatigue, and other constantly changing physiological states all affect the ebb and flow of resistance. Let's briefly discuss it:</p>
<p>A. Age</p>
<p>In infancy, the ability of its serum to kill and hemolyze bacteria such as typhoid bacilli, diphtheria bacilli, E. coli, and Staphylococcus aureus is lower than that of adults. This is sufficient to explain why infants are more susceptible to general pyogenic infections. The antitoxins in infant serum are about the same as those from the mother's body, so they can avoid suffering from some infectious diseases for a while, but these antitoxins contained in infants are all passive and cannot last long. Because the antigen is a colloidal substance, it cannot pass through the placenta and be imported into the infant's body, thus it cannot enable the infant to produce automatic immunity. It is questionable whether colostrum, which is rich in antigens, can produce immunity. Protozoal infectious diseases mostly do not have obvious immunity. Therefore, infants have no less chance of contracting diseases caused by general protozoa.</p>
<p>The proportion of polymorphonuclear leukocytes in the blood of newborns is about 70%, but it drops to 36% at six months, and then gradually increases again, rising to 60% at six years old. In addition, the basicity of infant blood is only 70% to 80% of that of adults, which is extremely unfavorable for resisting bacterial infections. The hydrochloric acid in infant gastric juice is also more dilute, which is also unfavorable for resistance.</p>
<p>The various metabolic functions of the elderly are reduced, their resistance is weak, and their susceptibility is high. However, this is a pathological property, while that of infants is a physiological property.</p>
<p>Looking at the mortality rate of each age group in various countries, the highest is newborns, which then decreases with time until about ten years old, reaching the lowest limit. After that, it increases with age, and by the time they are 105 years old, the chance of death has exceeded the chance of survival. It is difficult to generalize about this trend, but we can get a glimpse of the relationship between the rise and fall of resistance and age.</p>
<p>B. Gender</p>
<p>The physiological structures of men and women are different, especially the endocrine functions, which are very different. Researchers who study human lifespan know that the lifespan of women is longer than that of men, because their susceptibility to infectious diseases is lower than that of men. In general, every cell in the body of both men and women has different characteristics.</p>
<p>C. Race</p>
<p>Medical scholars are most likely to discover racial differences in resistance or susceptibility. If we compare the resistance or immunity of various human races to a certain disease, we can also often find considerable differences. However, when studying racial differences, all differences that can be caused by various external factors must be eliminated before it can be said to be a true racial difference. Let's talk about the differences that can be caused by external factors:</p>
<p>D. Nutrition</p>
<p>In years of famine, epidemics are often caused. As the saying goes, "After a great war, there will be a year of famine," which we all know, but we should not rashly say that poor nutrition is the direct cause of the epidemic. Those with poor nutrition do have reduced resistance to various infectious diseases. However, we still have no clear evidence to judge that those with poor nutrition will have increased infection rates. In general, our resistance to acute infectious diseases is mostly unique, and their infection depends on the chance of infection; but for chronic infectious diseases such as tuberculosis, leprosy, and dysentery, nutritional factors are particularly important.</p>
<p>Excessive nutrition can also have a temporary impact on disease resistance. Arnhld observed that the number of bacteria in the intestines of those who consumed too much protein increased greatly, and the permeability of the intestines also increased, causing bacteria to invade the lymph vessels in the intestinal wall.</p>
<p>When vitamins A and C are deficient, the susceptibility to general infectious diseases increases significantly, but taking large amounts of vitamins A and C will not additionally increase their resistance. Regarding the relationship between other vitamins and other nutrients and the rise and fall of resistance, there is currently insufficient information available for judgment.</p>
<p>E. Fatigue</p>
<p>The influence of fatigue factors on resistance is not easy to measure, because at the time of fatigue, there are often hunger, poor appetite, mental depression, or exposure to unsuitable environments, etc. Moreover, fatigue is often a sign of the onset of general infectious diseases, and may not be a direct cause, but fatigue can stimulate latent infections and promote the spread of the disease, which is proven by experiments.</p>
<p>F. Climate</p>
<p>The influence of climate on the rise and fall of resistance seems to be paid attention to by general epidemiologists. However, no one can say exactly what the exact relationship is. Among them, the influence of temperature and humidity is probably greater. Drastic changes in temperature and humidity are sufficient to reduce the resistance of the upper respiratory tract, and the bactericidal power of the gastrointestinal tract also seems to be reduced at the same time, and the permeability of the intestinal wall can also be improved.</p>

<h3 id="e154">Scottish Poet - Burns <a href="#e154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>— Shen Liren</p>
<p>250th Anniversary Commemoration</p>
<p>This year marks the 250th anniversary of the death of Robert Burns. This Scottish poet saint, because his works are too rich in local color and musicality, often makes those who admire him feel difficult to translate. Therefore, in China, he is not as familiar to a group of people as other prominent Western poets.</p>
<p>He was a native of Ayrsgire in Scotland, the small village that became famous because of him. In that small village, there is still an ugly thatched cottage, visited by countless travelers in spring and autumn, lingering and sighing near the short walls built of mud and stone. This is what Burns' father built with his own hands, and it is the birthplace of this great poet.</p>
<p>Burns' brother, Robbie, was also a famous poet. Their family had been farmers for generations. Burns only stayed in school for two years. From the age of nine, he began working in the fields. Therefore, in many of the magnificent rhymes he later wrote, we often seem to smell the scent of the soil. His father was a relatively enlightened farmer who hoped his children would receive education. On winter evenings or summer moonlit nights, old Burns often told stories from books to the children; at the same time, the mother taught them to sing various nursery rhymes. Just like many other outstanding writers, their genius was able to be nurtured and developed entirely due to family art.</p>
<p>Because of this, Burns became interested in legends and poetry. Whether he was hurrying to the market or wandering on the fields, or even at mealtime, he often grabbed a small booklet from his pocket and recited it. Gradually, he even learned to write poetry, reading it to his neighbors in his spare time. Everyone praised him happily, saying that his "mountain songs" were very pleasant and fresh.</p>
<p>At the age of twenty-three, his father passed away. His family moved to another piece of land and worked even harder, and his poems became increasingly mature. Once, he accidentally destroyed a field mouse's nest with a hoe. He felt guilty because winter was near and the little animal had no home. He wrote a poem to express his melancholy. Later, he said that from that day on, he decided to become a poet.</p>
<p>He met his future wife, Armour, at the age of twenty-five. At this time, he thought of going to the West Indies to work. He boldly published his first collection of poems. As a result, due to the meager reward, he could only go to Edinburgh. In that city of poets, he was quickly welcomed, quickly stood out, and quickly became famous, and published two more books of poetry.</p>
<p>Friends in Edinburgh introduced him to a job as a border tax collector. His new life made him constantly ride horses, traveling to remote wilderness areas. He often traveled through forests and mountains on dark nights, wearing rain and dew, but his pages of poetry also became thicker and thicker. Later, he fell into depravity. He spent his absurd years in the cellars of hotels with a group of low-class friends. He never stopped wanting to pull himself up, but every time after a long and cold rush, he could only find a trace of warmth and joy under the smoky roof. In the end, he lost his health, which was such a pity for the whole world!</p>
<p>Perhaps because of the abnormality of life or too much understanding of melancholy, any great poet is short-lived. Shelley only lived for thirty years; Keats traveled in the world for twenty-six springs and autumns; even Edgar Allan Poe's singing career was only a little over forty years. When Burns died, he had just passed his thirty-seventh birthday. This short period was full of sorrow and struggle.</p>
<p>Poets seem to have a premonition of death. Although he was only thirty-seven years old, he was aware of the approach of death. One winter night, he was sitting in the hotel with his companions as usual, when he suddenly said; "Friends, I am going to die." His friends all looked at him with strange and bewildered eyes.</p>
<p>He dragged his heavy steps and walked home silently, but he did not reach the door. Halfway, he actually accepted the invitation of the god of death.</p>
<h3 id="e155">Refugee Notes from Huangyangsi Station <a href="#e155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>— Shi Mo</p>
<p>The train drove into Huangyangsi—a small station on the Xiang-Gui Railway—and slowly stopped. It was the weather of May or June, and the sun was like a high-hanging fiery umbrella. People climbed down from the top of the train and out of the windows with anxious hearts, and burrowed under the train to cool off with their clothes open. No matter how unfamiliar they were, everyone asked each other cordially, inquiring whether Hengyang had fallen.</p>
<p>The station was a scene of noise and bustle. I was squeezed into the crowd, walking from one end of the stalls to the other, looking for something to eat. My head was a little dizzy from the sun. I looked up at the quiet train, lying there dark and desolate. People climbed up and down his body, walked back and forth.</p>
<p>As time passed, the sun gradually set in the west, and the sky opposite became even more distant and beautiful. After two faint whistles, a wisp of black smoke rose from a farmhouse in the distance. Everyone raised their tired eyes and looked, knowing that another train was dragging ten batches of refugees towards Huangyangsi, thinking in their hearts: "I wonder what is going on in Hengyang?"</p>
<p>I walked to a lonely little hill nearby and sat down, watching the train, emitting black smoke, gradually driving into the station. We suddenly realized that this train had driven onto the same track as the one we were parked on. Everyone immediately raised their arms and shouted. People's voices were like roaring waves, and people's arms were like branches swaying in the wind in the forest, waving in a disorderly manner, but the train, in the heavy sound of machinery, drove over heavily, giving people no time to hesitate, and with a "bang", collided with our carriage.</p>
<p>Suddenly there was silence, like a huge wave in the boundless sea rising against the wind, and then smashing fiercely on the rocks on the shore, followed by a very short period of silence after a crash, followed by a crashing sound of water mixed with the shattered falling sound of rocks, and the cries of the people followed.</p>
<p>The people who were cooling off under the carriages had their arms and legs broken, and the people who were shaken down from the carriages were pressed on top of them. Some fainted, and some had already stopped breathing. A wife was holding her child and looking for her husband. She ran madly through several carriages, and saw at a glance that her husband was lying in a pool of blood. She let out a scream, like a huge hammer heavily hitting her back, and fell forward in response, pressing on the chest of the dead, the child was thrown aside.</p>
<p>Someone walked over from the station with a cane, looked at the luxurious car transported on the train, which was not damaged, glanced casually at the dead and wounded on both sides of the long train, and then walked to the military station with a cane.</p>
<p>The wailing gradually subsided. In the setting sun, the lawn of the station reflected a dim light, and there was only a low sobbing mixed with groaning sounds.</p>
<p>We silently climbed into the car, but the train would not leave that day. I leaned out of the window, and the dark Huangyangsi station was covered with a faint moonlight. At this moment, the sound of a motor engine vaguely came from above, and four silver wings swept across the white clouds at the highest point in the sky. I suddenly turned my head back, and a bright star dragged a long, shiny tail, drawing an arc in the dark sky, and disappeared. A guest next to him murmured:</p>
<p>"I'm afraid Hengyang can't be defended. The enemy has gone to attack the airport in Lingling!"</p>

<p>People's Art</p>
<p>In German, Volkskunst; in French, Lart du Penplle, "People's Art" has three origins: one comes from the ideas of democracy and socialism, one is to reject decadent middle-class art, and one is for the emerging people. Especially the new art produced by the emerging class, it advocates that so-called true art is to gather the sorrows, desires, and beliefs of the people into the focus of personal life and burn. Romain Rolland is a representative of this kind of proposition.</p>
<p>Mammon Art</p>
<p>Mammonart in English is a kind of tendency to worship money, and art for the sake of gold. In a capitalist social organization, everything, including art, cannot be an exception, and undoubtedly has the possibility of becoming a commodity. The American literary theorist Sinclair Upton has a clear dissection of this point in his very famous book "Mammonart."</p>

<p>— Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>Oops! I told No. 04 a few words and hurried to the Road Bureau Power Plant. When I arrived on the road under the mountain ridge, I saw that it was indeed the people from Changxindian Town, carrying and carrying big and small bags, walking towards the factory. When asked, they all said in unison that the Japanese devils were about to attack, and they were preparing to take temporary shelter in the factory.</p>
<p>"Sister-in-law," I met Dingyuan's wife at the entrance of Dingyuan, "what's going on? ... Who told these people to move to the factory? ..."</p>
<p>"I don't know either!" She was very surprised, "Dingyuan is feeling better and hasn't gone to bed yet, please come into the house."</p>
<p>"This is really lively!" Dingyuan was indeed feeling better than in the morning, "Listen, the devil's artillery fire seems to be free."</p>
<p>At this time, the artillery fire was very intense. Every time a shell fell, with a bang, the window frames in the factory rattled. Several children were sitting in the corner of the room, with their eyes wide open and their ears perked up, as if they knew where the shells were falling. The eldest sister, Meijun, was also sitting with her younger siblings, her small hands clenched tightly.</p>
<p>I told Dingyuan that the location of the factory was really not good; if the situation was not right, this factory would be a target for attack. Moreover, the people in the town were all gathering here, which was especially bad.</p>
<p>Dingyuan pondered calmly; I don't know if he was really calm or pretending to be in the style of an English gentleman.</p>
<p>"There is nothing we can do about it," he said slowly, "the factory director is not here, these people in the town, the foremen and managers in the factory, have some relatives and friends. If one comes, we can't refuse the second one, don't you think so? As for what benefits there are after coming, maybe no one can say. ..."</p>
<p>I asked him if he had any intention of moving out. He said that it was actually impossible to do so; there was nowhere to go, and moving back and forth wouldn't get them out of Changxindian, unless he joined the army immediately. He hoped to recover soon and join the army as soon as possible. I saw that after talking back and forth, there was no concrete solution, so I had to end the conversation.</p>
<p>Meijun sent me to the door, following closely behind me. I told her not to be polite, to go back to take care of her father and take care of her younger siblings. She just walked silently behind me, as if she hadn't heard what I said. After walking a few steps, I felt strange, because she usually didn't act this way. Seeing that we were almost at the main road of the factory gate, I stopped and asked her if she had anything to say?</p>
<p>Under the hazy starlight and moonlight, she was wearing a light blue homespun dress. Her slender figure seemed to sway and flutter with the breeze. Her well-proportioned silhouette, set off by the blurry trees and branches and the faint moonlight, was very charming, though fleeting.</p>
<p>"Uncle!" Her voice was so soft that it couldn't be softer, but it was very clear, "If you have time, ..." Boom! Another shell fell and exploded not far away, shaking her, and the glass on the factory doors and windows echoed with a bang, drowning out the second half of her sentence.</p>
<p>"If I have time, of course, I'll come to see you often..." I guessed what she wanted to say, comforting her...</p>
<p>"I... I'm afraid!" She lowered her head, her voice a little choked up.</p>
<p>"Afraid of what... child?" I wanted to strengthen her courage, but then I thought that this sentence was not reasonable. She, a girl who was only seventeen years old, was trapped in such a terrible environment, her father was sick in bed, and the family was full of women and children. It was impossible not to be afraid. "Fear is also useless." I had no choice but to comfort her with irrelevant words, urging her to take care of her younger siblings and go to bed early, and promising to come early tomorrow morning to discuss a solution with her father.</p>

<p>— Shao Fu</p>
<p>It is said that the military strategist Yang Jie is now living a reclusive life on the south bank of Chongqing. He has converted to Tantric Buddhism, discusses Zen and debates Xuan, rarely appears in public places, rarely crosses the river once every one or two months, and even has very few visitors.</p>
<p>I was reminded of what Romain Rolland said in his preface to his "Life of Beethoven" in 1903. He said:</p>
<p>"Life is hard. For those who are not content with mediocrity, it is a struggle without end, often tragic, without glory, without happiness, a struggle unfolding in loneliness and silence."</p>
<p>Why is this rare military genius living in seclusion? We cannot superficially believe that his conversion to Tantric Buddhism is the silent decay of his life's talent. He is cultivating (not just religiously), he is struggling, and he is also waiting! Because someone like him is not willing to wither in any way.</p>
<p>But the struggle in loneliness and silence is hard.</p>
<p>Many geniuses are decaying without a sound. Mr. Yang Gengguang's recent life cannot but make people worry.</p>
<h3 id="e160">Jeep, we beg you for mercy! <a href="#e160" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c160" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">160</a></h3>
<p>— Teng</p>
<p>The big guys who drive Jeeps, the old masters who sit in Jeeps, the adults and gentlemen who are in charge of Jeeps, I kneel down and ask you as I pray to God: when the car is running on the road, slow down a little, and don't treat people's lives as less than dog shit, charging around and playing around. If you want to show off, it's enough to drive or sit in a Jeep. Why be so irrational? The day before yesterday (the 21st), an old worker, Chen Yusheng, was riding his bicycle home for dinner. When he walked near the Xiaocai Field on Liaoyang Road, he was hit from behind by a Jeep accelerating. The car was damaged (bicycle) and the person was injured with a broken leg. The Jeep then fled the scene and disappeared. Now Chen Yusheng is sleeping in the Shanghai East Hospital, suffering immensely. Imagine that it is like this in crowded places, and the rest can be imagined. It is said that most people who drive Jeeps use their hats and clothes as permits, and their driving skills can be imagined. Why do ordinary cars have fewer accidents, and Jeeps always have accidents? This responsibility lies with the traffic management authorities. First, they must drive at the speed specified in the regulations. Exceeding the speed should be absolutely punished, no matter how big the background is! Second, check their licenses when you see Jeeps. I think it will have some effect. I remember the former Shanghai Municipal Council's Chief Inspector of Traffic, Bu Lingfei Er, his car number was Nine, and when he was walking between Jing'an Temple Road and Seymour Road, a patrolman failed to stop the car in time, so he punished the patrolman for the fault of not stopping. He accepted it in the same way. The spirit of foreign service rules is really admirable! In fact, this is a trivial matter in foreign countries, it is a duty. Unexpectedly, this is rare in China. Big guys, old masters, adults and gentlemen who have Jeeps! Slow down the speed of the car! So as not to cause poor disasters! Don't think you can run rampant in the world, maybe you will run into a stronger ten-wheeled Jeep, then you will not get that advantage!</p>

<p>Last week, Mr. Renren Yu went to a movie theater alone to watch a movie. Just as he was engrossed in the movie, a woman next to him nudged him with her arm and said:</p>
<p>"It's so cold today!"</p>
<p>He didn't say anything, just nodded to the woman. After a while, the woman said again?</p>
<p>"The air conditioning is turned on too high, touch my hand and see how cold it is!"</p>
<p>While saying this, she stretched out a hand and placed it on Mr. Yu's hand. Because Mr. Yu did not push her hand away, she went further and stretched out the other hand as well, and leaned her body on Mr. Yu's body, saying:</p>
<p>"I feel a little uncomfortable, let me lean on you for a while!"</p>
<p>The woman was dressed very fashionably and looked very beautiful. Mr. Yu did not refuse and let her lean on him, using his hand as a hot water bottle for her to warm her hands. When it was almost time for the show to end, the woman said softly to him:</p>
<p>"I drank soda today, I need to go to the toilet. After the show is over, can you come to the entrance of the women's toilet to find me?"</p>
<p>After the show was over, he went to the entrance of the toilet to wait. He waited for a long time and didn't see the woman come out. He became a little impatient and raised his hand to look at his watch; who knew that the watch on his wrist was gone. Looking again, the ring on his finger was also gone. After a moment of stunnedness, he suddenly realized. It turned out that the woman had stolen the watch and ring while "warming her hands." At that time, he had to admire the woman's superb stealing skills, and he had to blame himself for not being able to resist the temptation of women at all, and for being so ignorant and unconscious that he didn't even know that his watch and ring had been taken off. Who else could he blame besides himself? He could only admit that he was unlucky. So he learned a lesson from his loss, and he said that he would never go to the Chang again in the future!</p>

<h3 id="e162">Children and Women's Spiritual Hunger How to Improve Serial Picture Books <a href="#e162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>— He Liping</p>
<p>The "serial picture book" issue has been discussed by people long ago. It is not necessary to say more about the bad influence she has on children and even adult women. I recently walked on Minguo Road and saw a small shop, the inside of which was filled with dense serial picture books. At night, the electric lights were bright, and many women and children sat on low stools and read attentively, like a small library.</p>
<p>Precisely because the content of serial picture books is nothing more than adultery, theft and gods and monsters, the people who read them unknowingly fill their heads with strange things, and these strange things will take effect at a certain period, (that is, they are poisoned by serial picture books,) for example, the past children's people's mountain seeking immortals and this time the Beijing Road blood case are all reactions after being poisoned.</p>
<p>But if we look deeper, people have been calling for banning serial picture books long before the Anti-Japanese War. Why can't it be realized? It's not that the Ministry of Interior has any permits that can't be prohibited; but in reality, it is because it has a large number of readers, and children and women have become lovers and supporters of serial picture books. Although their knowledge is shallow, they also need spiritual food, but our literary artists have forgotten them, and the difficult and Europeanized words strung together are like heavenly books, which cannot be understood by their intellectual level. I am not advocating the current serial picture books, but saying: although the current serial picture books are undesirable, once they are banned, where are the children's and women's readings? Our literary artists should lower their heads and look at these large numbers of women and children who are thirsty for spiritual food, use the form of serial picture books to inject scientific common sense, anti-Japanese heroic stories, historical celebrities' struggle history, ... inject these brand-new themes, so that serial picture books become educational textbooks that guide children and women to the bright road.</p>
<p>The form of serial picture books itself is not guilty, what is guilty is the content of adultery, theft, gods and monsters loaded through the form of serial picture books; we may as well turn around and put new wine in old bottles, using the old form of serial picture books to load the new content of scientific morality and art. This makes it easier to win over the children and women who love serial picture books. In order to save the women and children who are poisoned by serial picture books, in addition to passive banning, I more actively call on cultural people to pay attention to the issue, take action to serve the people, and create new serial picture books with flesh and blood!</p>

<p>— Xu Jingfu</p>
<p>Small Restaurants</p>
<p>In major cities in the United States, such as New York and Chicago, there are many small restaurants, named Speakeasy, which are inexpensive and convenient for men and women to have private conversations. There are many restaurants in Shanghai, but the prices are expensive, and most small restaurants are simply equipped, and even have inches of dirt, which makes people flinch. If they can be improved, they may be able to do more business for lovers.</p>
<p>Novelty</p>
<p>After a writer finishes writing a book, he spares no effort to find the perfect title. Americans admire novelty, and the titles of books are often colloquial, such as "Not too shallow, not too deep," "Only oysters have pearls," "Your child and mine." Some use bizarre words to show off, such as "The young man with horns" and "The Black-Eyed Woman's Strange Case." Some also use more cautious words, such as "After-dinner stories," "Borderland Beacon Fire," "Peace General," and "Wings of Terror." The best is a writer named Ruth Ludwig Gault. He wrote a novel called "I Love You, I Love You, I Love You!"</p>
<p>Satire</p>
<p>American theater critics are harsh in their criticism of unsatisfactory dramas. For example, the so-called smartest critic, the late Percy Hammond, after watching a performance by a dance troupe, called the owner of the troupe: "It seems that he forgot that a woman's knee is a physical joint, not an evening entertainment."</p>
<p>Another critic said of a play, "The scenery is beautiful, but the actors are blocking my view." He went to the extreme of sarcasm. Similar to this, there is also a mean theater review that said, "The play was performed very well, but the seats were too bad, facing the front of the stage."</p>
<h3 id="e164">Utter Selfishness <a href="#e164" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c164" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">164</a></h3>

<p>"Keep order, keep order!" People who hope to improve Shanghai's traffic are shouting this, and have shouted it many times. After September 9th, how much determination did the government make, how much energy did the traffic police put in, how much hope did the pedestrians put in, everyone was trying to make Shanghai like a qualified city, and also for the safety of the people themselves, but I don't know what kind of inferiority makes this group of people who don't abide by the rules lose their humanity, the cars always refuse to follow one after another, everyone is messing around; the atomic tigers (Jeeps) have no one in their eyes and treat human lives as if they were nothing. I don't know when they can be made to show their conscience and admit that everyone has the minimum right to survive. It is said that on the 21st, an atomic tiger injured a worker on Liaoyang Road, and he was so insane that he was irresponsible and lost all his sympathetic nature, and fled the scene. If this driver still has a trace of humanity left, he should hate his utter selfishness, extreme ruthlessness, and lack of humanity at the time, and ask the competent police station to punish him and personally apologize to the injured and compensate for medical expenses. Only in this way can he be a bright and upright Chinese citizen! The driver who caused the accident and escaped: we are looking forward to your brave and frank behavior!</p>

<h3 id="e166">Veteran Diplomat: Wang Zhengting <a href="#e166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>— Zheng Fan</p>
<p>An Eloquent and Adaptable Statesman</p>
<p>Dr. Wang Zhengting, who recently returned from the Philippines, is a name familiar to many. He is a veteran in Chinese diplomatic circles and is known for his eloquence. One only needs to see the grand pronouncements he made to reporters after returning from the Philippines (see this newspaper on the 18th) to witness his vibrant oratory.</p>
<p>Mr. Wang is from Fenghua, Zhejiang, and is a fellow townsman of Chairman Chiang. The two were very close in their youth. He was born on July 25th of the eighth year of the Guangxu reign, five years older than Chairman Chiang. In Chairman Chiang's personal diaries, he often mentions "Yirutang" (Wang's alias). In the letters Chairman Chiang sent to Chiang Ching-kuo and Chiang Wei-kuo, he often mentioned "Uncle Wang."</p>
<p>Old Revolutionary</p>
<p>Wang joined the revolution very early. While studying in Tokyo, he was personally introduced by the Founding Father and joined the Tongmenghui. Later, he went to the United States for further studies and became acquainted with many revolutionary martyrs. In the third year of the Xuantong reign, he returned to China with a Master of Arts degree from Yale University. It was the time of the Wuchang Uprising, and he followed Li Huangpi, serving as the Deputy Director of Foreign Affairs for the Hubei Military Government. Since then, he has been engaged in political life, and the positions he has held include:</p>
<p>Vice Minister and Acting Minister of Industry and Commerce, Vice Speaker of the Senate, Plenipotentiary Representative to the Paris Peace Conference, Minister of Foreign Affairs, Prime Minister, Minister of Finance, Chairman of the Customs Conference, Director-General of the Sino-Russian Conference, Director-General of the Longhai Railway, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the National Government, Ambassador to the United States, ...... and is now elected as one of the city's councilors.</p>
<p>Arguing Diplomacy</p>
<p>It is difficult to argue diplomacy, and it is even more difficult to handle diplomacy for a weak country. Wang took office as Minister of Foreign Affairs at the time when the Japanese invaders launched the Changhua Offensive; the Wanbaoshan Incident was not yet resolved, and the three northeastern provinces were suddenly and forcibly occupied. At that time, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs was truly "enduring humiliation and bearing heavy burdens," but there were many misunderstandings from the outside world, and Wang almost became the target of public criticism. Therefore, on September 28th of the twentieth year of the Republic (ten days after the September 18th Incident), more than 1,700 students from Central University poured into the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and Wang was actually beaten, causing a national sensation.</p>
<p>Wang is the foremost person in China to handle diplomacy. When the revolutionary government was formally established, representatives from twelve provinces gathered in Wuchang and held a meeting in the Changyang Company in the British Concession of Hankou. At that time, Wang was working in the Hubei Military Government, and because he was relatively familiar with foreigners, it was agreed to ask Wang to handle foreign affairs and constitutional drafting. Constitutional drafting for foreign affairs was unprecedented in China, with no established rules to follow, only learning from the United States. It is said that Wang initially relied heavily on "Principles of International Law" by Lawrence when handling foreign affairs, and this book was borrowed from an American missionary. The constitutional drafting at that time was also based on the American Constitution, but unexpectedly, the chapter on "Rights and Obligations" was missing. It turned out that the constitution formulated after the American independence was missing this chapter, which was later added in the final amendments. Wang and the other two constitutional drafting representatives—Lei Fen and Ma Junwu—did not have time to choose carefully due to the urgency of the situation. It is also a story.</p>
<p>Wang has been in politics for thirty-five years now, and his spirit and his eloquence particularly show his rich experience and insights.</p>
