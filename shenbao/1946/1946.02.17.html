<h3>滇經委會曁企業局　定兩月內改組成立</h3>
<p>〔本報昆明十四日專電〕滇經濟委員會與企業局，原係滇省兩大工業經濟系統，前者由政治恊商會議無黨派代表繆嘉銘主持，後者由中委陸崇仁主持。嗣經去年十二月十四日省府會議通過改組辦法後，此兩大機構即實施改組，由省府指定李印泉·丁又秋·繆嘉銘·龔仲鈞·朱麗東·虛玉書·吳石生·李儀廷等為籌委，並以繆為主委。企業局主持人陸崇仁，列為該公司顧問委員之一。値繆嘉銘赴渝出席協商會議之際，經委會及企業局即趕辦移交，迨繆氏於本月上旬返昆，對於各部人事及技術問題有所決定。有臨參會昨又建議：省府舊日在職人員，原在經委會及企業局之工作人員應避免參加人民企業公司，並電促李一平·謝顯集速回昆協助公司籌備事宜，昆市記者因探訪此舉眞相，遭籌委會拒絕，致引起一塲風波。聞該公司擬於兩月內籌備成立。茲探錄其組織原則摘誌如下：（一）公司股權屬於三種人民，其組織完成後，務期達到全滇人民有「自營自有自享」之權。（二）股權之分配，務求平均而公允，其初步階段達於每鄉鎭，俟全省戶籍調查完畢，應普及於每保每甲每戶。（三）在初步階段，其股權暫以鄉鎭為單位，股權歸鄕鎭民代表會管理，其所發生之利益，在公司由股東代表大會決定之，在鄕鎭由鄉鎭民代表會次定之，其範圍應以衞生敎育經濟為限。按該公司之成立，堪為我國省營事業中規模較宏資金較厚者。</p>

<h3>加拿大總理發表聲明　原子彈秘密洩漏　傳係為蘇使節團所獲</h3>
<p>加政府偵騎四出正澈查中</p>
<p>〔合衆社渥太　十五日電〕加拿大總理金氏，今日發表聲明稱：關於原子炸彈之「秘密情報」，業經洩漏於渥太華之某外國使節團人員。金氏謂：嫌疑之政府人員，已在澈查中，但渠並未指明該外國使節團之名稱。該聲明原文如下：「加拿大政府獲得確實無疑之情報，據謂：秘密情報已洩漏於無權顧問之人士，包括駐於渥太華之某外國使節幽若干人員在內。」按加拿大與英美兩國共同享有原子炸彈之製造秘密。</p>
<p>〔聯合社渥太華十六日電〕加拿大政府爲澈查某項「秘密情報」被人洩露於某國使節起見，今日出動騎兵偵緝隊大事搜查，並拘留二十二一人。據可靠方面稱：此項「秘密情報」係與原子能有關，某國係指蘇聯。政府各部及各機關前任及現任公務員多人，家中咸遭搜查。據悉其中一部份曾任職於國立科學研究會，該會爲政府傳達有關原子能情報之機關。衆信政府將正式宣佈獲得此項秘密者究爲何國。</p>
<p>〔合衆社渥太華十六日電〕金氏今日宣稱：加拿大最高法院法官二人，已對洩漏機密情報與某外國一案，開始秘密偵訊。據有權管轄加拿大原子能研究之建設部長霍威，於其聲明中宣稱：原子炸彈問題，並未牽連在內。紐約之報人披亞遜，上週日曾預言某某加拿大官員以供給情報與蘇聯而即將受訊，渠今晨於紐約「每日鏡報」第一版內，直接指出蘇聯人在美國與加拿大境內擁有一千七百名特務人員之間諜網，獲得原子彈構造計劃者，即係此中之一環，披亞遜並謂：當蘇聯特工投案及說出其餘一千七百人之姓名住址時，此事乃吿破案。蘇聯之特工，同時煽動美加兩國之公務員，使與蘇聯合作。披氏提出若干美國勞工領袖之姓名，並聲稱：國務院已准許前在華盛頓之勃萊茂登獲得原子彈計劃之蘇聯人，搭船圓國，因官方明示，拘捕該特工係屬次要，且有引起對蘇外交上之後果，而蘇聯或已有原子炸彈矣云。</p>

<h3>歷八載風霜·朱顏永不變　春光重映西子湖</h3>
<p>— 本報特派員　儲裕生寄杭州</p>
<p>勝利後的第一個春天來了，上杭州去！</p>
<p>八九年來，杭州大自然的風景不殊，但是在靈陽，凈寺附近，蘇堤，白堤上，都有敵八警戒，不得通過。在西湖上蕩舟一次，也得遵守其不合理的規定，所以連杭州人都懶得遊了。光明的春天，終於來了，西湖上的野雁，正在歡笑着等候遊客光臨！記者此次上杭州，是在立春後兩天。</p>
<p>兩尊銅像已撈獲　百年古楠變棺材</p>
<p>湖濱公園，不若從前那樣的花卉雜陳，除了幾株樹木外，都是一片片平地。湖邊的鐵鍊欄杆是新近纔加以修整的，欄杆柱子上的圓燈，至今還沒有裝上。八十八師陣亡將士紀念塔，依然存在，氣象巍峨，不减當年。兩尊銅像，是新近剛由西湖中打撈起來的。划子的裝璜，大不如昔，兩邊都以四塊木板做欄杆了。站在湖濱瞭望，環抱在四週的羣山，已不似八年前的蒼翠可愛，僅剩童山濯濯之殘姿，這自然是「皇軍」之所賜，因為他們與大小漢奸們早已把四山的樹木砍伐，不是化作柴料，便已變賣一空。聽說南山的一株兩百多年的楠木，被敵人的特務機關中的漢奸首領砍去做棺材用了。</p>
<p>月老投湖剩枯廟　市民伐櫻示決心</p>
<p>南山脚下，本有月下老人祠，在敵人暴力下，已被拆毀，而『老人「也早被他們投入湖底了。蘇堤上，本有「隔技楊柳隔枝桃」之勝景，敵人在時，曾改植櫻花，而今，都被可愛的杭州人連根拔去了。據說敵人在杭州全區所植櫻花，總數達數百萬株之譜，但沒有一株是種活了的。「花港觀魚」，亦已拆毀凈盡，只剩斷垣殘壁，不忍卒睹！</p>
<p>孤山梅花已含苞　靈隱羅漢待重塑</p>
<p>划子泛過外湖，達裏湖，博覽會橋却已不復存在。放鶴亭像是新近修理過的，孤山上的梅花，呈含苞欲放之態。林處士墓邊的一座財神廟，香火依然鼎盛，無所損毀，大槪敵人都曾在杭州做過發財夢吧！</p>
<p>中山公園裹的一座亭子被拆毀了，只有玉泉寺內的「晴空細雨池」和「珍珠來」，因為敵人不曾糟蹋，所以還保持完好。去靈隱的路上，幾所大房屋都被敵人燒毀了，連寺門也被燒掉了。寺內一些賣念珠的手杖的，擺茶座的，已開始做起生意來。靈隱的羅漢殿，已燒得精光，據寺僧相吿：要想重塑五百尊，可是圖樣沒有了，因為這五百尊羅漢有五百個不同的動的姿式，塑造殊非易易！</p>
<p>白堤無花眞白堤　蔣莊花房成廚房</p>
<p>舟子划出裏湖，經外湖穿蘇堤的東坡橋，轉進岳湖，那裏荒草叢叢，舟行為艱。「曲院荷風」，只剩一塊石碑。岳王廟到沒有什麼兩樣，門口賣手杖和念珠的，已在廟內設店。</p>
<p>循白堤回來，當年白堤兩旁的花卉憩亭，都已蕩然無存。「斷橋殘雪」，也眞有「斷」「殘」之感！</p>
<p>巡遊湖內莊國，不勝今昔之嘆！劉莊的古董被敵人搬空了，康莊被拆毀了，現在開放的僅是蔣莊，但莊內的花房却已變做廚房了。</p>
<p>此閒物價不算抵，三個人吃一餐極平常的飯，要四千五百元。從城站到湖濱的黃包軍資，要八百元。旅館中普通單人房間，要兩千八百八十元，但願這並不是一般的常傻，吾則，杭州市民眞不好消受啊！有人說，這裏物價是跟着上海漲的，但其實已經超過上海了。</p>
<p>深夜，西子湖畔奏起柔媚的樂曲。哦！這是市民們子們酣舞的時間了！（二，十五日。）</p>

<p>工商集團也商會和同集公會的組織，請先言其近狀。工商業團體的組織，大別為基　組織與職合組織。甚層組織是縣市區鎭商會以及商工（鑛）輸出各業同業公會，聯合組織是省商會聯合會，全國商會聯合會，和各業同業公會聯合會。截至卅四年底止，已組成之商會，經社會部核准備案者計一二三六個，同業公會九三四〇個，兩者合計為一〇五七六個。連同已報社會部經核飭更正查報而登記有案者，共達一四三六〇個。以上數字，均係後方各省市縣之商會公會，收復區尙在調整中。至於聯合組織，目前後方各省，除新疆外，省商聯會均已建立，僅雲南廣東兩會以設立程序不合，尙須重加調整。惟全國商聯會，自卅三年六月核准組織，預定是年年底成立，不意桂柳戰事吿急，被迫延緩。卅四年夏，局勢好轉，再度推動，籌備工作，大致齊備，曾決定於十一月一日成立，復因日本突然投降，復員措施，十分緊急，而以前淪陷區各省市依戰時權宜辦法產生之代表，亦難再認為合法，必須等收復區商公會調整完竣，方能成立，所以決定俟還都後，再行訂期召開。在卅四年度中，重要工商業成立聯合會的，有機器·棉紡織·火柴·汽車·以及川江·閩江·潼江·晋江·民船各業，或係全國性的，或依產區河流劃定的，這類聯合組織，前所未有。此外全國麵粉工業聯合會，亦已核准組織，即可成立，四川各地也在積極籌備組織各種重要出口業的聯合會。這種趨勢，可以說明工商業團體的組織，已由「點」漸進至於「面」或「綫」，且多出於本身需要，自動發起，不像過去需要政府來策動</p>
<p>工商業團體組織近况旣明，可進而檢討方針問題。戰時政府，對於人民多有約束之處，組織團體，必須先行申請許可。現在戰事結東，中央一再昭示，實行民主，保障自由。現行集會結社法令，正積極修訂或廢止。高公會以國謀同業共同福利，矯正弊害爲宗旨，是民法所稱公益團體之一種，是否仍應採取事前許可制，實有研究必要。次是工商界八年以來，對於國家貢默特多，而勝利後所遭損失亦最大，今後戮力建設，必然以工强國，以商富國，工商界的責任乃更重。社會部指導組織工商業團體，亦應有一鮮明的宏大的政策，以與農民政策，勞工政策，平衡發展。再次是社會團體與職業團體的問題。商公會法規定特別嚴密，社會人士，格於法令限制，另求出路，組織若干經濟性的協會學會，以研究學衛，策進事業，用意未始不善，社會部亦極期其能與商公會相輔相成。但事實上此類國體，不無侵越商公會法定任務，影響商公會基層組織之處，今後似宜嚴加限制，俾得各循正軌進展。最後是工商從業人員組織間題。社會組織，係以全民為對象，各種團體均以個人為組成份十。惟獨商公會是以公司行號廠礦為會員，全國千百萬工商業從業人員，除極少數得為會員代表以外，其餘均未納入組織。有些地方，請求組織福利會，究竟不够妥當完密。此一重大缺漏，尤應立定方針，亟謀補救。</p>
<p>此外尙有法規問題，値得一提。社會部改隸以後，谷種人民團體組織法規，多已先後修正或增訂，而商公會法迄未修訂。數年以來舊法多失時效，不能適應現狀，而新法未能建立，疑義滋多。社會部雖苦為解釋，先後達七百餘例，但補直罅漏，繁複錯亂，猶如治絲益棼。根本問題，自非從速核定立法原原則頒行新法不可。</p>
<h3>讀者意見　如何消弭工潮</h3>
<p>主筆先生：週來本市工潮澎湃，攷其原因，大抵由於物價高漲，一般職工所入不　維持，於是有要求改善待遇之提出。薪水階級生活之困苦，可說是田來已然。在此高物價之重壓下，基於生活之要求，其待遇自應作合理之調整。當局今日苟欲消弭工潮，應該對薪水階級的待遇有一個通盤籌劃之規定。為今之計，最好能由當局領導組織一個「全市各業職工薪津調整委員會」類似的機構，由當局邀請各業公會理事長及勞資雙方代表為委員，負責處理職工的待遇問題。對於職工薪津的規定，不妨參酌實際情形，先分別確定職工薪水或工資的基數，再比照各業工廠商店行號規模及營業狀况，劃分等級，然後參酌每月生活指數，加以規定。如此，始不致有所偏枯，對職工的生活亦可以有一點實際的補助。這無非是一個原則。具體辦法以及細目等，則有待於當局作審愼而周詳的擬議。讀者隱言上。</p>
<h3>星期論壇　如何籌措工業建設資金</h3>
<p>— 趙同連</p>
<p>—創設中國復興工業金融公司—</p>
<p>吾人默察國際政治內幕，考量立國基本需要，當前急務，端在如何爭取時間，促進工業化之速成。德國投降以後，俄國工業雖原具良好基礎，但仍繼續向英美接洽長期資金，購置機器，圖謀復員與更擴大之發展、又如南美及荷蘭，丹麥各國，亦無不利用其在戰前或戰時節儲之外匯資力，向英美訂購器材。至若英美等工業高度發展之國家，為加速工業之復興與建設，對於工業資金之供應，更有周密之規劃。以言英國，為便利工業資金之融通，最近曾有「工商業銀公司」（Finance　Corporation　for　Commerce　＆　Industry）之設置。此一公司，由英蘭銀行，各大合黃銀行，（Joint　Stock　Banks）及保險信託公司共同籌設。法定資本五千萬鎊，其貸放額度為資本之三倍，（因手邊無材料，此項數字係記憶所及）；此項貸款，亦由各投資機構依照投資比例分擔。以言美國，為加强工業復員與促進新興企業，復興金融公司之職能，業巳大爲擴張。例如參加貸款與買賣參加貸款之實施，不動產押放之推行，皆其重要新猷。華盛頓進出口銀行之貸放權力，亦已由六億元提高至三十五億元。凡此描施，皆基於一種共同之認識：即原有之銀行機構與職能，實不足以適應復興工業之需要也。返觀吾國，至今尙徬　於原則之討論，具體辦法迄未確立。時日蹉跎，良用憂慮！</p>
<p>建設工業之基本條件，不外資本，技術，與市場三項。有資本則技術人才問題隨以解次。至若市塲問題，則有賴全面經濟政第之合理措施。故當前最迫切而待解次者，厥爲資本問題。</p>
<p>建設工業需要長期及短期兩種資金。前者多用以購置機器設備及建立廠屋，為期較長，籌措亦難。後者則備原料工資等之週轉，期短而籌措亦易。吾國工業建設資金最感困難者，當為長期資金之籌給。本建議之主要目的，即在解決此一問題，並同時减除當前核結外匯之困難。</p>
<p>吾國工業建設初期所需機器，大都須向國外購置。至於廠房建築等工程所需材料人力，則泰半可取自國內。前者須用外幣支付，後者則可用國幣週轉。故工業建設之長期資金，有外幣與國幣之別。此項長期資金，因非普通銀行組織所能供應，故宜有一專門機構為統籌之調度。</p>
<p>就目前情形觀察，向國外訂購機器，須經相當時日方能交貨。吾國因戰時通貨膨脹，物價波動，對外匯率一時不易確定。匯率不定，則廠商訂購機器所需之外匯即不易結購。倘依照官價，實無異政府贈與：旣啓廠商取巧之機，又加重政府之損失，而外匯基金復未必能全得正用。茍依黑市匯率，則又為廠商資力所不及。若必待匯率確定再向國外大量洽購，則復員建設至少落後兩年！故吾人認為為促進建設，迅赴事功起見，在外匯率未能合理調整以前，必須有一過渡辦法，以便實業界早日從事復員工作，而同時又無損於政府之外匯基金。此其一。</p>
<p>吾國工業建設，需要外匯資金綦鉅。現時政府及國人所握外匯之總數雖屬可觀，但就整個工業建設所需資金言，仍感大量不敷。欲求工業化之速成，必須積極設法，實際利導外資，俾使國內工業能藉外資而迅速發展。同時又須使外國投資者樂於貸放，高枕無憂。此其二。</p>
<p>吾人為樹立工業界在外國之信用，幷代向國外接洽借款及購置機器等獲得優厚條件起見，必須有一資力雄厚之金融機構，為集中而有效之運用。此其三。</p>
<p>工廠在國內建立廠房及購置國內機件原料所需之國幣長期資金，亦應有專門　爲統籌之供應。此　四</p>
<p>倘上速四　早獲　次，則工業界可立即依照政府方針，爭取時間，投步前進；無須再斤於原則之空論，而徒費時日。筆者考慮再四，特提出辦法七項，以供國人參考。</p>
<p>（一）由國家銀行及主要商業銀行，信託公司，保險公司等，合資美金五億元及國幣五十億元，組織「中國復興工業金融公司」（以下簡稱公司），以作利導外資與籌集工業長期資金之中心機構。</p>
<p>（二）公司之主要功用，為代理廠商接洽國外長期放款與投資，代理廠商訂購機器材料，代向國外作信用担保人，代付外匯價款，幷得對國內工廠直接貸放長期國幣及外幣資金。</p>
<p>（三）在外匯率未確定前，廠商向國外訂購機器，得以黃金，美金，或美金儲券，美金公債，英鎊，及其他可靠外匯之任何一種或數種，繳付定金。所需外匯價款，由公司祖保或代墊者，仍按各該外國貨幣計値，俟外匯率確定後，再逐漸折算償還。</p>
<p>（四）凡公司代中國廠商向外國廠商接洽投資放款與金融界所作之祖保，政府可再代公司向外國政府及人民作全面無條件之担保，以增强公司在外國之信用。</p>
<p>（五）凡工廠在國外購辦機器·材料，需要政府協助接洽，或代為借款者，概由公司統籌辦理，以一事權，幷便向國外取得優厚條件。</p>
<p>（六）俟公司在國外信用確立後，如有必要，得與外國洽商，在國外資本市場發行外幣實業債券。</p>
<p>（七）為滿足工業界所需國內長期資金要求，幷兼顧國內資本之貧乏與資本市場之尙未建立起見，公司得按廠商實際需要，接受各廠所發債券，或以廠基房屋作抵，貸放中期或長期國幣資金。貸放資金之來源，除公司之國幣資本外，得以債券及其他憑證向國家銀行及其他股東銀行公司質押借款。</p>
<p>上述辦法倘能實現，則當前工業界結購外匯之困難，當可立即解除，輸入外資之機構亦可立即具備。同時，因公司資力雄厚，可博得外國之信任；因事權統一，可在外爭取較優之條件；又因能接受工廠所發之債券，轉向銀行借款，故國幣長期資金之籌措間題亦可迎刃而解。依此估計，倘經營得法，則以五億美元之資本，至少可引導十五至二十億美元之長期外資流入。如此，初期建設所需之外幣資金，泰半可吿解次。國家　建前途，實深利賴！</p>

<h3>赴校報名小學生失踪　在蘇州救回肉票　匪徒要求以十五條金子取贖</h3>
<p>（本報訊）滬西德路源裕里十九號徐虎泉（供職軍委會）有一子，名文華，十五歲，甫由重慶返滬，本月九日有一親眷呂紹奎者，到來騙文華及其姊文芳同往徐家匯徐匯公學報名。抵該校附近時，呂語文芳云，請稍等，一去即來，詎知呂携文華一去不復來，文芳不得已返寓。比至翌晨九時許，始來一電話，謂徐呂兩人業已被綁，請備款待贖云云。十二日又致電話一次，語意大致相同。十五日上午復來電話，雙方商妥金條十五條贖票，並約下午在姚主敎路電車站派人接洽。二時徐姓乃據情報吿靜安寺分局。司法股派股員陳金生·郭玉屏·韓永昌等會同其嫂談士英其姊文芳屆時前往，未幾果見呂紹奎與解姓兩人向文芳等談話，遂一併就擒，帶局偵訊。據供，肉票藏於蘇州新蘇旅館廿七號房間，當由原班人員於十五最搭軍往蘇，果將肉票安然救出，乘車返滬。</p>
<h3>失事美機人員　猶未尋獲</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕上月三十一日，有美空運機一架，由濟南飛滬，行經太倉上空，因機件損壞，致告失事。上有官長六名，跳傘降落太倉區，另五名則降落太倉瀏河之間。美軍當局除於二月一日在瀏河發現破碎飛機一架外，二週來一無消息。延至前日（十四日）下午五時，美軍當局得中國官員報稱，上月二十一日在太倉崑山之間，發現美軍降落情事。美軍當局即於昨晨派員，並請淞滬警備司令部辦事處連絡官，會同前往該地視察。但調查結果，獲悉華方所謂之降落機，並非該運輸機。</p>
<p>緣事屬巧合，上月三十一日美軍用機一架，由滬飛出，至太倉上空，亦因機件損壞，被迫降落，當即電滬派機前往援助。不知第二機下降後，亦不復能飛，因此再由滬美當局派機二架前往修理，經修竣後，四機均平安返滬。此事於同日發生，因之華方報吿有所誤會。</p>
<p>至此運輸機上降落之十一人，則至今仍無着落。據美軍方面猜測，或係落入中國共產區內，現正繼續四出調查。</p>

<h3>金鈔證券　發現黑黑市　錢兌業在觀望中</h3>
<p>烚赤昨仍無公開賣買，黑黑市則以求供雙方互有授受，陪都金鈔報漲，趁賤有人吸收，川帮套頭亦有補進，初時在一四五萬至一五〇萬，一度步高至一五三萬以上，錢兌業方面昨起亦不敢繼續營業，十四日午後所做之隔夜交易，定即日實行交割，浮多迫於銀根，暗拆昻達二角半，多頭聞訊震慄，賣氣漸盛，漸漸下游退至一四〇萬以下，此際國家銀行職員實行怠工，提存不便，亦有相當影響，最低見一三八萬而後稍形穩定，午後一四三萬前後徘徊，飾金仍無掛牌，傳週一銀樓可能恢復營業，紋銀一千六，銀兀自七九〇元至八四〇元，暗拆因業中辦理交割，需款孔殷，銀行方面受四行影響，對提現頗爲不便，息價的二角至二角半。</p>
<p>外幣昨更沉寂，錢兌業亦懾於當局查禁，幾全部不敢營業，黑黑市美鈔初爲二〇〇〇至二〇五〇元，最高二〇五〇元至二〇八〇元，最抵回挫至一九八〇元至二〇〇〇元，最後二〇〇〇元至二〇三〇元，港票稍較疲怯，乃因港方來電，國幣報三九（合港票二五六元餘），匯水八折，約合滬市三二〇元左右，以致老票約二四〇元左右，港電則因棉紗帮需要，約三〇五元左右，新票乏人注意。</p>
<p>公債丙種買賣雙方略有讓受，價約一六五〇元左右，華股亦有人逢低過問，暗市永紗約二〇〇〇元至二一〇〇元，美亞一五〇〇元至一六〇〇元，景福一〇〇元至一一〇元，新光九二元至九五元，勤興八〇元至八五元，外股則仍沉寂。</p>

<p>生產建設特輯</p>
<h3>生產建設的重要步驟　人才合作</h3>
<p>我們日常和一般工業界接觸，大多數人都感覺人才的缺乏，成爲一個相當嚴重的問題。因爲要建設，第一先要人才，如果沒有人才　一切良好的計劃，都無從實施</p>
<p>本來在我國有很多用非所學的情形，所從事的工作，根本並不是以前能學習或素有研究的。在過去抗戰期問，又因爲生活不能安定，許多人不得不實行改行，於是很好的專門人才，變成了普通的商賈，到了勝利來臨，正要開始建設的時候，就缺少人才來應付目前的需要。</p>
<p>許多工廠，在抗戰初期，因把工廠內移，等到抗戰勝利，希望在上海重起爐灶的時候，不但沒有經濟力量，更沒有充分的人才來擔任復興的工作。</p>
<p>一個專鬥人才的造就，並不是一天可以成功的，一個完善的人才，必須具備學識和經騐，因此放樂一個人才，就等於損失了一筆很大的資產。</p>
<p>從今以後，除加緊訓練入才之外，更不容固有的人才去改行，這一個工作的完成，要從兩方面入手；一方面在工業界要設法安定專門人才的生活，使他們可以安心工作，努力進取；同時在職工方面，也要明瞭不時的改行，祇能應付目前，雖則實現也是不能忽略的，但並不會有良好的結果；燮方並且應該採取密切的合作，爲整個事業着想，因爲今後生產建設的成功，除了經濟條件之外，可以說是以人才合作的成功爲先次條件的。</p>
<h3>英國的勞資聯擊</h3>
<p>— 淸和</p>
<p>我爲了要明瞭英國的經濟悄形，特地到那裏去考察了一次，我所發現的是英國的工業界一點沒有什麼不景氣的現象。勞資雙方，能够澈底合作，使他們的工業活躍起來，富有生氣。英國的工業家，也都在打起着精神把他們的事業稅意整頓。在開始的時候，勞資雙方就用協議的方法，解決工作時間和薪給等問題，上自煤礦·農業·棉業·建築業·下至一切小規模的企樂。那些陳舊的聯合會辦法，一律加以改正，有一部份戰時創立的法規，雖則依舊應用，但曾加以改善，以適應建設時代的環境。在五千家工廠裏勞資雙方合組的委員會中，把勞工方面的技術和管理人員方面的技術合併起來，產生了很大的效果。</p>
<p>他們以爲最大的目的，是要增進英國人的生活標準，這一個目的，比任何主義，更來得重要，所以必須把一切不良的舊習慣革除，有損工作效能的悄形加以改良，俾能產生最高限度的生產量。</p>
<p>對於英國的勞工問題，沒有比勞工黨在下議院的議員馬立遜Herbert　Mordon更富於研究，他說：「我們的國家所需要的是較多的國家的妝入，使全國的勞工，都有職業。我們必須要有巨額的出口品，合於科學原理的生產。祇要我們努力地做去，我們一定可以達到目的，我們絕對不要爲我們自己着想，也不要祇求個人或一黨的滿足，如果是應該國營的，那末就必須由國家經營，如果是宜於民營的，那末就不妨由民衆經營。</p>
<p>另外有一個勞工團體的領袖人物曾經說：「戰勝資本家固然可以得到一時的快感，但對於整個的工業是不利的，對於生產機構也是不利的，爲了應付戰後的生產需要起見，我們要使雙方合作起來。</p>
<p>英國的勞工在第二次大戰時期，工作的時間較第一次大戰的時期爲長，工作的環境也較遜，但因爲罷工事件而損失的人小時Man　Hour祇及第一次大戰時的五分之一。這種情形並不是說勞工們已經停止提出改善待遇的要求，而是他們已經明瞭他們應該負起的責任，他們要保持那隻工業的鵝，使他可以生出很多很多的蛋。</p>
<p>到了目前，英國的勞工組織，比任何工業化的國家都來得堅强，但是他們並不强迫每一個勞工必須加入工會。英國的工業，所以能够進步，不外乎兩種原因，第一是「自動」，第二是」相互的信任」，無錫勞方或是資方，都能够爲整個事業着想，我可以舉兩償的來說明：</p>
<p>有一家汽車製造廠的董事說：「以前我們是採取由上而下的管理的方法的，但到了目前，　一種方法已經是不通行的了」。因爲他已經放棄由資方專　的方式。我曾到孟吉斯德的一家工廠裏去參觀，那喪的工人對我就，以前他們每一個工人，管理一架機車，　　人們自動地計劃出了節省　　　　法，現在一個工人，可以管理三架機車，因此生產量就大爲增加。英國的工人很明白如果他們要得到更多的收入，享受更好的生活，一定先要使英國的工業獲得較多的營業。</p>
<p>英國大實業家考多德說；「英國的勞資合作，是採取一種適中的辦法的，使能够產生最高限度的效率，這一種醒覺，可以說是機械化時代開始以來的極大的成就，前途正顯着無限的光明。」</p>

<h3>不可忽視的手帕製造業</h3>
<p>— 姚因偉</p>
<p>織造業中佔着重要地位</p>
<p>人生要素中的衣，雖是佔去大部份，司是手帕襪子等，也缺不了它。手帕的人手一塊，其重要和襪子的人足一雙，初無二致</p>
<p>在民國初年時，盛行白色藍格子的絲質手拍，產地是盛澤。但在那時候，一般人對於衛生還不講究，生活也簡樸，所以大多數人忽視而不備，以後遂有東西洋出品的白紗手帕，顏色漂亮如英國製的塔牌Pyramidn阿地Ideal考羅白Colorbide捷克製的三花牌Miracle等，充斥市場，覇據了十多年，金錢賺去不知凡幾？當時國貨雖有，然很簡陋，不過，購了布裁剪縫紉就算數了。以後改良到以白布來印花，而更改進到染成各色的紗識成手帕。如此當然比印花進步得多。但是較之外貨，還是望塵莫及。後來染織業興起，逐漸的有進展，可謂手帕業的發靭時期。迨歐戰爆發，洋貨漸次絕跡。筆者鑒於發揚國貨之良機已至，就首肩艱巨，創設寰球手帕織造廠，以去蕪存着，別出心裁的本旨，為國貨爭光，與外貨抗競。最先問世的是一百支麻紗實球牌織花緞條手帕和安全牌緞條手帕繼之又創造雙面緞條手帕，這種手帕正反面多有緞條和細緻的花紋，所以不僅媲美舶來品，抑且駕乎其上。因此盛銷各地，出品不脛而走。在民國卅一年，筆者感到婚壽開幕等等禮品，每年耗費金鐵，數　　人，於是苦心研究，得於是年秋，又發明手帕花籃，轟動一時，咸謂美觀實惠。因此手帕又多一種出路，而同業亦逐漸的增加起來，到現在爲止，手帕同業，已有九十多家。每天產量，日就增多。但是時代在不斷的進展，人類物質享受的慾望和知識，也與日俱增，手帕非但爲了實用，更進步到了具備裝飾價値。所以質的方面必須盡善盡美，而顏色方面更是重要。</p>
<p>現在抗戰是勝利了，工業的生產是建國工作中最重要的核心。　事工業的人，更應該埋頭苦幹，來努力於建設的工作。領袖調勉：「生活之目的，在增進全體人類之生活，生命之意義在創造宇宙繼起之生命。」的確可以奉爲努力的目標，希望同業對於幼稚的機械設備，逐漸的改進。使外貨不能再來和我們競爭，更進一步，我們更要誰銷到國外，競銷到全球，更　　　人一致愛用國貨，减少人　　數目。國父昭示：「當以吾人數十年必死之生命，奠國家億萬年不拔之根基。」筆者以爲生產必須增加，不許濫造；建設必須成功，不許失敗。</p>
<h3>工業復員的現實問題</h3>
<p>— 羅立羣</p>
<p>我國因爲生產落後，大規模工業，除了外商創設者外，實在根少。一切工業生產的基層組織，是由中小型工廠來支持的，但因爲資力薄弱，除了必要的生產設備以外，平時唯一的費金運用，是依靠銀錢業放款和各業間的信用賒欠來維持挹注的，但是中小型工廠因爲數量很多，同時很能够埋頭苦幹地做，對於整個生產機構的貢獸，相當偉大。</p>
<p>但自從日寇進佔我國，經過敵偽八年的統制和收買，本來基礎薄弱的中小型工廠，經不起狂　疾浪的摧殘，早已筋疲力盡，雖然現在抗戰勝利，必須實行工業復員，但中小型廠的資金蘊蓄量，在先受敵偽的搜括，已只剩軀壳，目前又爲高物價所壓制，要圖復員，眞是十分困難。</p>
<p>所以當前工業復員的現實問題，是怎樣使中小型工廠趕快復業，怎樣使　們發展而能夠有大規模的生產。</p>
<p>現在最感需要的，就是經濟上的援助，因為巨額的放款在目前不易獲得，信用的餘欠習慣，也已經打破，誠望政府能夠考慮及此，迅速擬訂廣大的工廠貸款計劃，使中小型工廠未開工的儘速開工，已生產的增加生產，那末工業復員，不僅是一句動聽的口號，而可以成為事實了。</p>
<h3>應付困難</h3>
<p>— 傳良駿</p>
<p>新光標準內衣染織整理廠，近年以來，迅速發展，創聯人傳良駿先生，處理各項事務，有獨到的地方，特請他發表一點事業經營的心得，承惠此稿，足資讀者借鏡。—編者</p>
<p>在任何事業的經營上，終不免要遇到種種困難，在遏到了困難的時候准有沉着應付，方始可以克服困難，而踏到進步的階段。</p>
<p>以新光標準內衣染織整廠而論，自從創辦到目前，曾經遇到許多次的困難，諸如運輸的斷絕，棉布的收買等，都以使新光過去的一點成就，全功盡棄，幸而在發生困難的時候，用最大的努力，去克服困難，反而得到了進步的機會。</p>
<p>今後將遇到的困難，一定相當地多，所以要隨時準備困難的來臨而設法應付。</p>
<p>要克服困難，全神貫注在種事業上，是非常重要的，因為一個人的精力，惟有貫注在一種事業上的時候，方始能夠有應付的力量。</p>
<h3>蠶絲界福音</h3>
<p>我國　絲機械，事變之前，大部份均由日本輸入，國人所製極少，自經八年戰事之後，蠶桑區所有蠶絲工廠，燬滅殆盡，雖政府爲發展蠶絲外銷，竭力振興蠶桑事業，而　絲工廠常有無從置備機械之苦，近聞有徐統詔孔浩莊等，應蠶絲界之需要，購置新式機械，於上海白利南路二九六弄二二號創設泰來鐵工廠，除　　門精　絲機械外，舉凡絹統織綢，紡紗，織布，製茶等機械，亦無不悉心研究製造，並代為計劃各種工廠全部設備云。</p>

<p>其中紗廠中除三家因爲機器廠房損壞過多，未曾開工外，其餘十六家，已經開工生產，內中有內外第九廠和大康二廠已開始做日夜工，在最短期內，預備全部開日夜工，使生產的數量，可以增加一倍，至於目前的生產已超過四十萬錠，預計在一個月內，可以擴充到五十萬錠以上。</p>
<p>僱用工人</p>
<p>截止目前爲止，所備用的工人，紗廠方面共計男工四千零四十二人，女工八千三一百零二人，毛紡廠方面，共計男工五百三十人，女工九百八十人，印染廠方面共計男女工人七百二十三人。</p>
<p>每日每班工作的時間是十小時，如果開日夜工，那末共工作二十小時。</p>
<p>市價問題</p>
<p>在目前因爲原料來源，還不能暢達，生產量就不能迅速增加。最近很有人主張完全採用國棉，但以中國四百萬紗錠全部開足計算，每錠每年需要原棉二擔半，總共就需要原棉一千餘萬詹，估計今年全國產棉量，不到五百萬擔，因為交運關係，實際能供紗廠生產的恐怕不滿二百萬擔，所以要使全部開足，是相當困難的。因為產量有限，需要較多，尤其在前幾天金價展開漲風的時候，紗價隨着上漲，該公司曾經用了最大的力量，設法和平，在適當的時候，方始開價，（比市場開價遲一二小時）使投機者無法從中漁利，同時可以制止漲風，（有幾天因爲市價劇漲，該公司的價格距離過達，反有被投機者利用的危險，如果根本不賣，更足以使漲風變本加厲，因此爲頋全現實，祗得把價格提高，但仍與市價有相富距離。（但因爲產量關係，同時受金價影響，還不能發生預期的效果，但該公司已經盡了最大的努力了。</p>
<p>今後方針</p>
<p>今後的方針，對於紗布方面，爲防止囤積並爲鼓勵生產起見，特加售大量筒十紗，直接配組與各廠家，在銷的方面，旣然可以供給實銷用戶，在市價方面，也可以多一個控制的機會。</p>
<p>在經營方面，除了原料的缺乏外，熟練工人的缺乏，也是很雖重的問題，因爲一個熟練的工人，至少須有三個月的訓練時間，所以該公司正在生產的過程中培植大批熟練的勞工。</p>
<p>埋頭苦幹</p>
<p>中國紡織建設公司，並不像普通一家工廠，那末單純，因爲同時接管許多工廠，所以經營上是相當繁重的，該公司總經理束雲章先生，注重實際，不尙空談，埋頭苦幹，今後一定可以在環境許可的情形下，向前邁進。</p>

<h3>The Railway Management Section Commences Work, Striving to Restore Transportation With All Efforts, Transportation Teams Will Be Dispatched to Various Locations</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Peiping, 15th] The Executive Headquarters for Military Mediation in Peiping has been established for over a month. The four key tasks of stopping conflict, restoring transportation, accepting surrender, and repatriating prisoners have achieved good results through the sincere cooperation of the government, the Communist Party, and the United States. Regarding stopping conflict, there have been no significant conflict incidents in most areas due to the efforts of the executive teams. To restore transportation, a Railway Management Section has been specially added to be in charge of this matter. Although there are still various technical problems to be resolved, the restoration of transportation is a common goal of all three parties, and it is believed that it can be completed smoothly. The surrender acceptance work is complete, as the Japanese troops in the China Theater have long been disarmed. If the transportation network can be restored within three months, the repatriation of prisoners can be promoted smoothly. Therefore, restoring transportation has become the key to the success or failure of the Executive Headquarters' entire work.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent, Peiping, 15th] The Executive Headquarters issued Public Communiqué No. 11 today, stating that the Railway Management Section has commenced work. It is also learned that the Headquarters has instructed teams in various locations to quickly report where to dispatch transportation teams to facilitate early dispatch and to order all teams to supervise road repairs nearby. After Zhang Fakui again declared that there were no Communist troops in the jurisdiction of the Guangzhou Headquarters, the Communist side within the Executive Headquarters also raised the issue here, insisting that Zhang's denial was untrue. It is reported that the Executive Headquarters has ordered the Guangzhou team to investigate the Communist-held areas. The team is already under investigation. Furthermore, the Communist side is scheduled to hold a cocktail party on the 18th to entertain officials from all parties and the American representatives.</p>

From Xuzhou to Kaifeng, traffic is unimpeded, with one special express train and one mixed train each day, mainly for passenger transport, and the order is very good. Kaifeng to Zhengzhou is also open. Due to the Yellow River changing course and the Zhongmu Bridge being destroyed, the current route runs from Kaifeng to Xinxiang and then to Zhengzhou. A mixed train is temporarily running on this section. Zhengzhou to Luoyang is currently served by a light train, running irregularly every few days. The Black Stone Pass Bridge on this section has not yet been repaired, and traffic is temporarily suspended at the Black Stone Pass Bridge, with connections at both ends.

<h3>China's Silk Company Will Revive the Zhejiang Silk Industry</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Hangzhou, 16th] The Zhejiang silk industry will be operated and supported by the China Silk Company. The mulberry seedlings produced in Chang'an and Shimenwan in Zhejiang Province are of the best quality. Previously, the annual production volume was 5 million to 10 million plants. According to recent surveys, the annual output is less than 1 million plants, because most silkworm farmers painfully removed the mulberry trees because there was no market for the seedlings. Many of the silk factories in Zhejiang Province were taken over by the enemy and puppets. Currently, less than half of them remain. Most of the seed production farms with scale no longer exist. The China Silk Company will start with the cultivation of mulberry seedlings, increase purchase prices, purchase in large quantities, provide loans, encourage planting, improve silkworm breeds, improve silk quality, and at the same time guide private silk factories to resume work as soon as possible.</p>

<h3>The First Post-War Loan to China, a New Era of Sino-Canadian Cooperation, a Treaty of Amity with the United States is Under Discussion</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 16th] After the formal signing of the Canadian loan to us of 60 million Canadian dollars, President Song issued a statement stating that Canada made great and glorious contributions and achievements in this war.

<h3>The Yunnan Economic Commission and Enterprise Bureau Will Be Reorganized and Established Within Two Months</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent, Kunming, 14th (Special Dispatch)] The Yunnan Economic Commission and the Enterprise Bureau were originally the two major industrial and economic systems in Yunnan Province. The former was presided over by Miao Jiaming, a non-partisan representative to the Political Consultative Conference, and the latter was presided over by Central Committee member Lu Chongren. After the provincial government meeting passed the reorganization measures on December 14 last year, these two major institutions were reorganized. The provincial government designated Li Yinquan, Ding Youqiu, Miao Jiaming, Gong Zhongjun, Zhu Lidong, Xu Yushu, Wu Shisheng, and Li Yiting as members of the preparatory committee, with Miao as the chairman. Lu Chongren, the head of the Enterprise Bureau, was listed as one of the advisory committee members of the company. While Miao Jiaming was in Chongqing attending the Consultative Conference, the Economic Commission and the Enterprise Bureau rushed to complete the handover. When Miao returned to Kunming in early this month, he made some decisions regarding personnel and technical issues in various departments. The provincial参政会also suggested yesterday that former employees of the provincial government and former employees of the Economic Commission and the Enterprise Bureau should avoid participating in the People's Enterprise Company, and telegraphed Li Yiping and Xie Xianji to return to Kunming as soon as possible to assist in the company's preparations. Kunming reporters, wanting to investigate the truth of this matter, were rejected by the preparatory committee, causing an incident. It is reported that the company plans to be established within two months. The following is a summary of the organizational principles: (1) The company's equity belongs to three types of people. After its organization is completed, it must ensure that all the people of Yunnan have the right to "self-operate, self-own, and self-enjoy." (2) The distribution of equity should be equal and fair. In the initial stage, it should reach every township, and after the household registration survey of the whole province is completed, it should be popularized to every bao, jia, and household. (3) In the initial stage, the equity is temporarily based on the township as a unit, and the equity is managed by the township people's representative meeting. The benefits generated by the company are decided by the shareholders' representative meeting, and in the township, they are decided by the township people's representative meeting. The scope should be limited to sanitation, education, and economy. The establishment of this company can be regarded as the largest and most well-funded provincial-level enterprise in our country.</p>

<h3>Canadian Prime Minister Issues Statement: Secrets of the Atomic Bomb Leaked; Rumored to Have Been Obtained by the Soviet Embassy Staff</h3>
<p>The Canadian Government is Investigating Everywhere</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Ottawa, 15th] Canadian Prime Minister King issued a statement today stating that "secret information" regarding the atomic bomb has been leaked to personnel of a certain foreign embassy in Ottawa. King said that suspected government personnel are under investigation, but he did not specify the name of the foreign embassy. The original statement is as follows: "The Canadian government has obtained certain and undoubted information to the effect that secret information has been leaked to unauthorized advisors, including certain personnel of a certain foreign embassy stationed in Ottawa." Canada, Britain, and the United States jointly hold the secrets to the manufacture of the atomic bomb.</p>
<p>[United Press, Ottawa, 16th] The Canadian government dispatched mounted police today to conduct a major search and detained 22 people in order to investigate the leak of certain "secret information" to a certain foreign embassy. According to reliable sources, this "secret information" is related to atomic energy, and the certain country refers to the Soviet Union. The homes of many former and current civil servants in government departments and agencies have been searched. It is understood that some of them once worked at the National Research Council, the government agency that disseminates information related to atomic energy. It is generally believed that the government will formally announce which country obtained this secret.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Ottawa, 16th] King announced today that two judges of the Canadian Supreme Court have begun a secret investigation into a case of leaking secret information to a certain foreign country. Minister of Reconstruction Howe, who has jurisdiction over Canadian atomic energy research, announced in his statement that the atomic bomb issue was not involved. Pearson, a New York reporter, predicted last Sunday that a certain Canadian official would soon be interrogated for providing information to the Soviet Union. This morning, in the front page of the New York "Daily Mirror," he directly pointed out that the Soviet Union possessed a spy network of 1,700 agents in the United States and Canada, and that one of them who obtained the atomic bomb construction plan was one of them. Pearson also said that the case was solved when the Soviet agents surrendered and gave the names and addresses of the remaining 1,700 people. Soviet agents also incited civil servants in the United States and Canada to cooperate with the Soviet Union. Mr. Pearson put forward the names of several American labor leaders and claimed that the State Department had allowed Brahmond, a Soviet national who obtained the atomic bomb plan in Washington before, to board a ship and return to his country, because officials clearly stated that arresting the agent was secondary and would cause diplomatic consequences with the Soviet Union, and that the Soviet Union might already have the atomic bomb.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Ottawa, 15th] After Canadian Prime Minister King announced the leak of secret information, it was announced here today that the authorities are investigating the sale of a uranium mine (atomic bomb manufacturing material) to a foreign government in recent months. Several people have been arrested, including the French scientist Baron. However, this matter is not related to the Prime Minister's statement, because the Prime Minister only refers to the illegal sale of radium ingots.</p>
<h3>When Testing the Power of the Atomic Bomb, 100 US Warships Participate; British Professor Says Atomic Energy Can Be Conquered Within Ten Years</h3>

Former US Air Force Commander General Arnold announced on the 15th that when testing the power of the atomic bomb against warships, Air Force observers will seek to answer the following questions: (1) How far can an aircraft approach the explosion site without being destroyed? (2) How strong is the radiation in the air near the explosion site? (3) Is there radiation in the huge cloud rising from the explosion site? At that time, a special team of the Air Force will use ten radio-controlled B17 aircraft, without human power to take off and land. Starting March 1, 30 transport aircraft will carry aviation personnel to and from Bikini Island every day.</p>
<p>[United Press, London, 15th] Professor Oliphant from the University of Birmingham, who participated in the manufacture of the atomic bomb experiment, predicted today that atomic energy can be conquered within ten years and used for industrial purposes.</p>

<h3>My Representative Explains Views on the Levant's Request for Troop Withdrawal; Advocates Direct Negotiations Between Concerned Countries; The Security Council's Discussion This Morning Again Yields No Results</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper News] London broadcasted on the 16th that the United Nations Security Council discussed the complaints of Lebanon and Syria today, but no results were achieved. After adjourning for four hours, it will discuss again. During this morning's meeting, Soviet representative Vyshinsky suggested that the countries concerned conduct negotiations as soon as possible. The British representative said, "Under permissible circumstances, British troops will withdraw as early as possible."</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 15th] At a meeting of the United Nations Security Council today to discuss the application of Syria and Lebanon to request the withdrawal of troops from Britain and France, many representatives of various countries spoke in support. Dr. Gu Weijun, the chief representative of China, also delivered a simple and practical speech, explaining the views of the Chinese government, which roughly stated: The principle raised by this matter is that without the clear consent of the government of the host country, foreign troops are stationed in the territory of another country, and this other country is an allied country. This situation clearly restricts the sovereignty of a country and is contrary to the spirit of the United Nations Charter and international law. Any troops should withdraw after completing their mission and achieving their goals. We believe that the best way to resolve the problem is for the countries concerned to adopt negotiation procedures. We hope that these negotiations will proceed smoothly and report to the Security Council at any time.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 16th] Soviet representative Vyshinsky stated in the Security Council yesterday that the Soviet Union fully supports the demands of Syria and Lebanon. US representative Stettinius believes that if direct negotiations to resolve the Levant issue continue, the Council should retain the right to instruct them to report on the progress.</p>
<h3>Polish Troops in the British Army; Poland Demands Immediate Dissolution; Says Senior Officers Are Engaged in Anti-Government Activities; Soviets Complain About the Mobilization of Polish Troops in Southern China</h3>

<p>[United Press, London, 15th] The Polish government submitted a note to Britain today, stating that there are 107,000 Polish troops who were previously under the command of the Central Army Command and fought in Italy. Now that the war is over, it should be requested to demobilize these troops and send them back to their country. A British Foreign Office spokesman said that this note came suddenly and was quite surprising. This move and the UN Security Council's rejection of Soviet accusations against British troops stationed in Greece and the East Indies may be related.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper News] London broadcasted on the 16th that Soviet representative Vyshinsky submitted a memorandum to UN Secretary-General Relye on behalf of the Yugoslav delegation, saying that the Polish army in Italy has advanced towards the Yugoslav border.

<h3>Local Dispatches</h3>
<p>Songjiang: Local Histories Urgently Need Organization</p>
<p>The method for compiling local gazetteers in this county was promulgated by the Ministry of the Interior in July of the 33rd year of the Republic (1944). According to the provisions of Article 3, provincial gazetteers should be compiled once every thirty years, and city and county gazetteers once every fifteen years. However, local documents have suffered many losses due to the impact of the War of Resistance. Now that the War of Resistance has been won, local gazetteers urgently need to be collected and organized for reference in policy implementation. Therefore, the Ministry of the Interior has instructed all counties to promptly send two copies of local gazetteers, along with a survey form, and to report the compilation situation in detail. After receiving the order, the county government has sent personnel to investigate and report, and plans to set up a gazetteer compilation hall to be responsible for the compilation work.</p>
<p>Pinghu: Tragic Bus Accident on the Pingjia Highway</p>
<p>Following yesterday's murder case on the Pingzha section, another tragic bus accident occurred on the Pingjia section. The accident site was near the Jiaoyang Bridge at Shigedizhijiao, about two miles away from Jiaoshanmen. Two buses, one from Pingjia and one from Pingzha, arrived at the site one after the other. Unexpectedly, the driver of the Pingzha bus in the rear suddenly accelerated to the left side of the road, hoping to overtake the Pingjia bus. The driver did not honk the horn, causing the Pingjia bus to avoid it hastily, resulting in a tragic rollover accident. The bus was carrying fifty or sixty passengers and hawkers in the roof compartment. A female passenger, being small in stature, suffocated to death on the spot. Others suffered broken bones and bleeding, a very tragic sight. The police bureau has summoned the persons in charge of both companies and the driver for thorough investigation.</p>

<h3>After Eight Years of Hardship, Her Beauty Remains Unchanged: Spring Light Shines Again on West Lake</h3>
<p>—Special Correspondent Chu Yusheng Reports from Hangzhou</p>
<p>The first spring after victory has arrived, let's go to Hangzhou!</p>
<p>For the past eight or nine years, the natural scenery of Hangzhou has not changed, but in Lingyin, near Jingci Temple, on Su Causeway, and on Bai Causeway, there have been enemy sentries, and passage was not allowed. Boating on West Lake once required compliance with unreasonable regulations, so even the people of Hangzhou were too lazy to visit. The bright spring has finally arrived, and the wild geese on West Lake are happily waiting for tourists! This reporter went to Hangzhou two days after the Beginning of Spring.</p>
<p>Two Bronze Statues Have Been Recovered; Centuries-Old Phoebe Becomes a Coffin</p>
<p>Lakeside Park is not as full of flowers as it used to be. Except for a few trees, it is all flat ground. The iron chain railing by the lake has recently been renovated, but the round lamps on the railing posts have not yet been installed. The Monument to the Martyrs of the 88th Division still stands, majestic in appearance, no less so than in the past. The two bronze statues were recently salvaged from West Lake. The decoration of the boats is not as good as it used to be, with four wooden planks on each side as railings. Standing on the Lakeside and looking around, the surrounding mountains are not as lush and lovely as they were eight years ago, leaving only the bare remains of barren hills. This is naturally the gift of the "Imperial Army" because they and the big and small traitors had already cut down the trees on the four mountains, either turning them into firewood or selling them all. It is said that a phoebe tree over two hundred years old on Nanshan was cut down by the leader of the traitors in the enemy's special service agency to make a coffin.</p>
<p>The Old Man Under the Moon Thrown into the Lake; Only a Withered Temple Remains; Citizens Cut Down Cherry Blossoms to Show Determination</p>
<p>At the foot of Nanshan, there used to be a shrine to the Old Man Under the Moon, but it was demolished under the violence of the enemy, and the "Old Man" had long been thrown into the lake by them. On Su Causeway, there used to be a beautiful scene of "willows interspersed with peaches," but when the enemy was present, they planted cherry blossoms instead. Now, all of them have been uprooted by the lovely people of Hangzhou. It is said that the total number of cherry trees planted by the enemy in the entire Hangzhou area reached millions, but not a single one survived. "Viewing Fish at Flower Harbor" has also been completely demolished, leaving only broken walls and ruins, unbearable to look at!</p>
<p>Plum Blossoms on Gushan Are Budding; Arhats in Lingyin Await Resculpting</p>
<p>The boat sails across the outer lake and reaches the inner lake, but the Expo Bridge no longer exists. The Crane Releasing Pavilion seems to have been recently repaired. The plum blossoms on Gushan are budding. A Temple of Wealth near the tomb of Lin Bu is still thriving, undamaged, presumably because the enemies had dreams of getting rich in Hangzhou!</p>
<p>A pavilion in Zhongshan Park has been demolished. Only the "Clear Sky Fine Rain Pool" and the "Pearl Spring" in Yuquan Temple are still intact because the enemies did not spoil them. On the way to Lingyin, several large houses were burned down by the enemies, and even the temple gate was burned down. Some people selling prayer beads and canes in the temple and setting up tea stalls have started doing business. The Arhat Hall of Lingyin has been burned to ashes. According to the monks in the temple, it will be difficult to resculpt the five hundred Arhats because there are no drawings. These five hundred Arhats have five hundred different dynamic poses, and sculpting them is not easy!</p>
<p>Bai Causeway Without Flowers Is Truly a White Causeway; Flower Houses at Jiangzhuang Become Kitchens</p>
<p>The boat sails out of the inner lake, passes the Dongpo Bridge of Su Causeway through the outer lake, and turns into Yue Lake, where weeds are overgrown, making navigation difficult. Only a stone tablet remains at "Breeze-Ruffled Lotus at the Crooked Courtyard." Yue Wang Temple is no different, and vendors selling canes and prayer beads have set up shops in the temple.</p>
<p>Following Bai Causeway back, the flower pavilions on both sides of Bai Causeway in the past have disappeared. "Broken Bridge with Lingering Snow" truly has a sense of "brokenness" and "lingering"!</p>
<p>Touring the villas in the lake, one cannot help but sigh at the changes of the past and present! The antiques in Liu Zhuang were emptied by the enemies, Kang Zhuang was demolished, and only Jiang Zhuang is open now, but the flower houses in the villa have become kitchens.</p>
<p>The prices here are not cheap. A very ordinary meal for three people costs four thousand five hundred yuan. The fare for a rickshaw from the railway station to the lakeside is eight hundred yuan. An ordinary single room in a hotel costs two thousand eight hundred and eighty yuan. I hope this is not the norm, otherwise, the people of Hangzhou will really not be able to afford it! Some say that the prices here are rising along with Shanghai, but in fact, they have exceeded Shanghai.</p>
<p>Late at night, gentle music plays on the shores of West Lake. Oh! This is the time for the citizens to dance happily! (February 15th)</p>
<h3>Organizational Problems of Industrial and Commercial Groups</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper, Chongqing Airmail] The organizational problems of industrial and commercial groups have attracted much attention from the people in the recovered areas since the victory. Yesterday, the reporter visited Zhai Jingshen, the section chief in charge of the Ministry of Social Affairs, and received the following response.</p>
<p>Regarding the organization of industrial and commercial groups such as chambers of commerce and trade associations, please first talk about their current situation. The organization of industrial and commercial groups can be broadly divided into basic organizations and vocational organizations. The basic organizations are county, city, district, and town chambers of commerce, as well as trade associations for various industries such as commerce, industry, and mining. The joint organizations are provincial federations of chambers of commerce, the national federation of chambers of commerce, and federations of trade associations for various industries. As of the end of the 34th year of the Republic (1945), 1,236 chambers of commerce had been organized and approved by the Ministry of Social Affairs, and 9,340 trade associations, totaling 10,576. Including those reported to the Ministry of Social Affairs and registered after verification and correction, the total reached 14,360. The above figures are for the chambers of commerce and trade associations in the rear provinces and cities. The recovered areas are still under adjustment. As for the joint organizations, provincial federations of chambers of commerce have been established in all provinces in the rear, except Xinjiang. Only the Yunnan and Guangdong federations need to be readjusted because the establishment procedures were not in compliance. However, the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce was approved for organization in June of the 33rd year of the Republic (1944) and was scheduled to be established at the end of that year, but the war in Guilin and Liuzhou forced its postponement. In the summer of the 34th year of the Republic (1945), the situation improved, and preparations were resumed, and were largely complete. It was decided to be established on November 1st, but the sudden surrender of Japan made restoration measures very urgent, and the representatives from the provinces and cities in the previously occupied areas, produced by wartime expediency, were difficult to recognize as legitimate. Therefore, it was decided to wait until the chambers of commerce and trade associations in the recovered areas were adjusted before it could be established, so it was decided to set a date for convening after the return to the capital. In the 34th year of the Republic (1945), important industrial and commercial federations established included machinery, cotton textiles, matches, automobiles, as well as the Sichuan River, Min River, Tong River, Jin River, and civilian shipping industries, either nationwide or divided according to production areas and rivers. This type of joint organization was unprecedented. In addition, the National Federation of Flour Industries has also been approved for organization and will be established soon. Various places in Sichuan are also actively preparing to organize federations of various important export industries. This trend shows that the organization of industrial and commercial groups has gradually progressed from "points" to "surfaces" or "lines," and is mostly initiated automatically out of their own needs, unlike in the past when the government needed to promote them.</p>
<p>Now that the current situation of the organization of industrial and commercial groups has been clarified, we can proceed to review the policy issues. During the war, the government had many restrictions on the people, and the organization of groups required prior application and permission. Now that the war is over, the central government has repeatedly declared that it will implement democracy and guarantee freedom. The current laws and regulations on assembly and association are being actively revised or abolished. The purpose of high-level associations is to seek common welfare for the country and to correct malpractices. They are a type of public interest group as defined by the Civil Code. Whether or not to adopt a pre-approval system still needs to be studied. Secondly, the industrial and commercial sectors have contributed a lot to the country in the past eight years, and have suffered the greatest losses after the victory. In the future, they will devote themselves to construction, inevitably strengthening the country through industry and enriching the country through commerce. The responsibility of the industrial and commercial sectors is even greater. The Ministry of Social Affairs' guidance in organizing industrial and commercial groups should also have a clear and grand policy to develop in balance with agricultural policies and labor policies. The third issue is the issue of social groups and professional groups. The laws of chambers of commerce and trade associations are particularly strict. Social people, restricted by laws and regulations, seek other ways out, organizing some economic associations and societies to research academics and promote careers. Their intentions are not necessarily bad, and the Ministry of Social Affairs hopes that they can complement the chambers of commerce and trade associations. However, in fact, these national organizations inevitably encroach on the statutory tasks of the chambers of commerce and trade associations, affecting the basic organizations of the chambers of commerce and trade associations. In the future, it seems appropriate to strictly restrict them so that they can develop along the right track. Finally, there is the issue of the organization of industrial and commercial employees. Social organizations take the entire people as their object, and various groups are composed of individuals. However, the chambers of commerce and trade associations take companies, firms, factories, and mines as members. Millions of industrial and commercial employees across the country, except for a very small number who can be member representatives, are not included in the organization. In some places, requests to organize welfare associations are not appropriate or complete. This major omission should be rectified and remedies should be sought urgently.</p>
<p>In addition, there are legal issues worth mentioning. After the Ministry of Social Affairs was reorganized, most of the laws and regulations governing the organization of people's groups were amended or added to successively, but the laws of chambers of commerce and trade associations have not yet been amended. Over the years, the old laws have become outdated and cannot adapt to the current situation, and new laws have not been established, creating many doubts. Although the Ministry of Social Affairs has tried hard to explain, reaching more than seven hundred cases, supplementing loopholes is complicated and chaotic, like trying to untangle silk and getting more entangled. The fundamental problem is to promptly approve and finalize the legislative principles and promulgate new laws.</p>
<h3>Reader Opinions: How to Eliminate Labor Unrest</h3>
<p>Mr. Editor: Labor unrest has been surging in this city for the past week. After examining the reasons, they are mostly due to high prices, and the income of ordinary employees cannot maintain a living, so there are demands for improved treatment. The hardship of salaried people can be said to have been a long time coming. Under the heavy pressure of these high prices, based on the demands of life, their treatment should be reasonably adjusted. If the authorities today want to eliminate labor unrest, they should have a comprehensive plan for the treatment of salaried people. For the present, the best thing to do is for the authorities to lead and organize a "Citywide Employee Salary Adjustment Committee" or a similar organization, with the authorities inviting the chairmen of the trade associations of various industries and representatives of both labor and management to be members, responsible for handling the issue of employee treatment. Regarding the regulations on employee salaries, it may be appropriate to refer to the actual situation, first separately determine the base number of employee salaries or wages, and then divide them into grades according to the scale and business conditions of factories, shops, and firms in various industries, and then refer to the monthly cost of living index to make regulations. In this way, there will be no partiality, and there can be some practical assistance to the lives of employees. This is just a principle. Specific measures and details, etc., are waiting for the authorities to make careful and detailed plans. Anonymous reader.</p>
<h3>WEEKLY FORUM HOW TO RAISE FUNDS FOR INDUSTRIAL CONSTRUCTION</h3>
<p>— Zhao Tonglian</p>
<p>—Establishing the China Reconstruction Industrial Finance Corporation—</p>
<p>Observing the inner workings of international politics and considering the fundamental needs of nation-building, the urgent task at hand is how to seize time and accelerate the completion of industrialization. After Germany's surrender, although Russia's industry had a good foundation, it continued to contact Britain and the United States for long-term capital to purchase machinery, seeking restoration and further expansion. Similarly, South American countries, as well as the Netherlands and Denmark, are all using their foreign exchange reserves saved before or during the war to order equipment from Britain and the United States. As for countries with highly developed industries such as Britain and the United States, they have even more comprehensive plans for the supply of industrial funds to accelerate industrial reconstruction and construction. In the case of Britain, to facilitate the financing of industrial funds, the "Finance Corporation for Commerce &amp; Industry" was recently established. This company was jointly established by the Bank of England, major joint-stock banks, and insurance trust companies. The authorized capital is 50 million pounds, and the lending limit is three times the capital (this figure is based on memory as I don't have the materials at hand). This loan is also shared by various investment institutions according to their investment proportions. In the case of the United States, to strengthen industrial recovery and promote emerging enterprises, the functions of the Reconstruction Finance Corporation have been greatly expanded. For example, the implementation of participating loans and buying and selling participating loans, and the promotion of real estate mortgages, are all important new initiatives. The lending power of the Washington Export-Import Bank has also been increased from 600 million yuan to 3.5 billion yuan. All these measures are based on a common understanding: that the original banking institutions and functions are insufficient to meet the needs of industrial reconstruction. Looking back at our country, we are still hesitating in principle discussions, and concrete measures have not yet been established. Time is wasted, which is truly worrying!</p>
<p>The basic conditions for building industry are nothing more than capital, technology, and markets. With capital, the problem of technical talent will be solved accordingly. As for the market issue, it depends on reasonable measures in overall economic policy. Therefore, the most urgent issue to be resolved at present is the capital problem.</p>
<p>Industrial construction requires both long-term and short-term funds. The former is mostly used to purchase machinery and equipment and build factory buildings, which takes a longer time and is more difficult to raise. The latter is for the turnover of raw materials, wages, etc., which is short-term and easier to raise. The most difficult part of industrial construction funding in our country is the provision of long-term funds. The main purpose of this proposal is to solve this problem and at the same time reduce the current difficulties in settling foreign exchange.</p>
<p>The machinery needed for the initial stage of industrial construction in our country mostly needs to be purchased from abroad. As for the materials and labor required for factory construction and other projects, most of them can be obtained domestically. The former requires payment in foreign currency, while the latter can be circulated in domestic currency. Therefore, there is a distinction between foreign currency and domestic currency in long-term industrial construction funds. Since this long-term capital cannot be supplied by ordinary banking organizations, it is appropriate to have a specialized institution to coordinate its allocation.</p>
<p>Judging from the current situation, it takes a considerable amount of time to deliver machinery ordered from abroad. Due to wartime inflation and price fluctuations in our country, the exchange rate is not easy to determine for a while. If the exchange rate is uncertain, it will not be easy for manufacturers to settle and purchase the foreign exchange needed to order machinery. If following the official price, it is tantamount to the government giving gifts: it not only creates opportunities for manufacturers to take advantage, but also increases the government's losses, and the foreign exchange fund may not be fully used for its proper purpose. If following the black market exchange rate, it is beyond the reach of the manufacturers' financial resources. If we must wait for the exchange rate to be determined before purchasing in large quantities from abroad, then the restoration and construction will be at least two years behind! Therefore, we believe that in order to promote construction and expedite practical achievements, before the exchange rate can be reasonably adjusted, there must be a transitional measure to enable the industry to engage in reconstruction work as soon as possible, while at the same time not damaging the government's foreign exchange fund. This is the first point.</p>
<p>Industrial construction in our country requires a huge amount of foreign exchange funds. Although the total amount of foreign exchange currently held by the government and the people is considerable, it is still felt that the amount is largely insufficient for the funds required for the entire industrial construction. To achieve rapid industrialization, we must actively find ways to practically guide foreign investment, so that domestic industries can develop rapidly with the help of foreign investment. At the same time, foreign investors must be willing to lend and feel worry-free. This is the second point.</p>
<p>In order to establish the industrial community's credit abroad and to obtain favorable terms for negotiating loans and purchasing machinery, etc., we must have a financially strong financial institution for concentrated and effective utilization. This is the third point.</p>
<p>The long-term domestic currency funds required by factories to build factory buildings and purchase domestic machinery and raw materials should also be specially provided for centralized coordination. This is the fourth point.</p>
<p>If the above four points can be achieved as soon as possible, the industry can immediately follow the government's policy, seize the time, and move forward; there is no need to argue over principles in empty theories, wasting time. After repeated consideration, the author puts forward seven measures for reference by the people of the country.</p>
<p>(1) The National Bank and major commercial banks, trust companies, insurance companies, etc., should jointly invest US$500 million and 5 billion yuan in domestic currency to organize the "China Reconstruction Industrial Finance Corporation" (hereinafter referred to as the "Corporation") as a central institution for guiding foreign investment and raising long-term industrial capital.</p>
<p>(2) The main functions of the Corporation are to act as an agent for manufacturers to negotiate long-term loans and investments from abroad, act as an agent for manufacturers to order machinery and materials, act as a guarantor abroad, pay foreign exchange payments, and directly lend long-term domestic currency and foreign currency funds to domestic factories.</p>
<p>(3) Before the exchange rate is determined, manufacturers can pay a deposit in gold, US dollars, or US dollar savings bonds, US dollar bonds, pounds sterling, and any one or more reliable foreign currencies when ordering machinery from abroad. The required foreign exchange payments, guaranteed or advanced by the Corporation, are still valued according to the respective foreign currencies, and gradually converted and repaid after the exchange rate is determined.</p>
<p>(4) The government can re-guarantee the Corporation's guarantees to foreign governments and people without any conditions for the investments, loans, and financial circles negotiated by the Corporation on behalf of Chinese manufacturers with foreign manufacturers, in order to enhance the Corporation's credit abroad.</p>
<p>(5) All factories that purchase machinery and materials abroad and need the government to assist in the negotiation or provide loans shall be handled by the Corporation in a unified manner, in order to centralize authority and facilitate obtaining favorable terms from abroad.</p>
<p>(6) After the Corporation's credit is established abroad, it may negotiate with foreign countries to issue foreign currency industrial bonds in the foreign capital market if necessary.</p>
<p>(7) In order to meet the requirements of the industry for long-term domestic capital and to take into account the scarcity of domestic capital and the fact that the capital market has not yet been established, the Corporation may accept bonds issued by various factories according to their actual needs, or lend mid-term or long-term domestic currency funds with factory land and buildings as collateral. In addition to the Corporation's domestic currency capital, the source of lending funds may be borrowed from the National Bank and other shareholder banks and companies through bonds and other certificates.</p>
<p>If the above measures can be realized, the current difficulties in settling foreign exchange in the industry can be immediately resolved, and the institution for importing foreign investment can also be immediately established. At the same time, because the Corporation has strong financial resources, it can win foreign trust; because the authority is unified, it can strive for more favorable terms abroad; and because it can accept the bonds issued by factories and borrow from banks, the problem of raising long-term domestic currency funds can also be easily solved. According to this estimate, if managed properly, the capital of 500 million US dollars can guide at least 1.5 to 2 billion US dollars of long-term foreign investment to flow in. In this way, most of the foreign currency funds needed for initial construction can be resolved. The future of national construction deeply relies on it!</p>

It is not only the preliminary stage of practicing the New Life Movement, but also the necessary procedure for municipal construction. While the government authorities must do their best to implement it, all citizens must also cooperate to know that the result of rectifying the appearance of the city can be used as a test of whether we are sincere in practicing the New Life Movement, and it is also from here that we can examine whether we can "understand propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame, take responsibility, and abide by discipline" to be a modern national and build a modern country. I hope that all compatriots in the city will earnestly abide by it and implement it together to make Shanghai a tidy, clean, and beautiful city, on par with other major cities in the world, to demonstrate the spirit of Shanghai citizens of removing the old and establishing the new.</p>

<h3>ELEMENTARY SCHOOL STUDENT GOING TO SCHOOL TO REGISTER DISAPPEARS, RESCUED IN SUZHOU, BANDITS DEMAND 15 GOLD BARS FOR RANSOM</h3>
<p>(Our newspaper) Xu Huquan (working in the Military Commission) of No. 19 Yuanyuli, Delu, Shanghai West, has a son named Wenhua, 15 years old, who just returned to Shanghai from Chongqing. On the 9th of this month, a relative named Lu Shaokui came to deceive Wenhua and his sister Wenfang to register at Xuhui Public School in Xujiahui. When they arrived near the school, Lu said to Wenfang, please wait a moment, I'll be right back. Unexpectedly, Lu took Wenhua away and never returned. Wenfang had no choice but to return home. It wasn't until about 9 am the next morning that a phone call came, saying that Xu and Lu had been kidnapped, and please prepare a ransom, etc. Another phone call was made on the 12th, with roughly the same meaning. On the morning of the 15th, another phone call came, and both parties agreed to ransom the ticket for 15 gold bars and arranged to send someone to contact them at the Yaozhu Road tram stop in the afternoon. At 2 pm, the Xu family reported the information to the Jing'an Temple Branch. Chen Jinsheng, Guo Yuping, Han Yongchang and other staff members of the Judicial Section, together with his sister-in-law Tan Shiying and his sister Wenfang, went to the place at the appointed time. Not long after, they saw Lu Shaokui and Xie talking to Wenfang, etc., and they were all arrested and taken to the bureau for interrogation. According to the confession, the hostage was hidden in room 27 of the Xin Su Hotel in Suzhou. The original team took a military vehicle to Suzhou on the 15th and safely rescued the hostage and returned to Shanghai by car.</p>
<h3>PERSONNEL OF CRASHED AMERICAN AIRCRAFT HAVE NOT YET BEEN FOUND</h3>
<p>(Our newspaper) On the 31st of last month, an American air transport plane flying from Jinan to Shanghai crashed due to mechanical failure while passing over Taicang. Six officers on board parachuted down to the Taicang area, and another five landed between Taicang and Liuhe. The American military authorities found a broken aircraft in Liuhe on February 1, but there has been no news for two weeks. It wasn't until 5 pm the day before yesterday (14th) that the American military authorities received a report from Chinese officials that American troops were found landing between Taicang and Kunshan on the 21st of last month. The American military authorities immediately sent personnel yesterday morning, and asked the liaison officer of the Songhu Garrison Headquarters to go to the area for inspection. However, the investigation revealed that the landing aircraft reported by the Chinese was not the transport aircraft.</p>
<p>It was a coincidence that an American military aircraft flying out of Shanghai on the 31st of last month was forced to land over Taicang due to mechanical failure. It immediately telegraphed Shanghai to send a plane for assistance. I don't know if the second plane could not fly after landing, so the American authorities in Shanghai sent two more planes to repair it. After the repairs were completed, all four planes returned to Shanghai safely. This happened on the same day, so the Chinese report was misunderstood.</p>
<p>As for the eleven people who landed on the transport plane, there is still no news of them. According to the American military, they may have fallen into the Chinese communist area, and they are currently continuing to investigate everywhere.</p>
<h3>A MAN IN THE GREAT WORLD COMMITS SUICIDE DUE TO ECONOMIC PRESSURE</h3>

After someone discovered it and called the police, a suicide note was found in his pocket, which read Wang Ziyun, 54 years old, from Huzhou, because he was suffering from poverty and illness and had no way to support himself, so he took this action.</p>
<h3>FIRE ON ZHONGZHENG ROAD</h3>
<p>(Our newspaper) A certain auto parts shop at No. 573 Zhongzheng Road caught fire unintentionally at about 7:15 am yesterday. The entire three-story building was burned down, and the roofs of the adjacent houses No. 571 and No. 575 were also affected. The fire department drove to the scene to put out the fire, which was extinguished after an hour and a half.</p>
<h3>VESSELS RECEIVED BY THE CHINA MERCHANTS STEAM NAVIGATION COMPANY WILL ALL SAIL WITHIN A SHORT TIME</h3>
<p>The new ships received by the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company have been underway for a month since the middle of last month, and a total of ten Victory ships and Liberty ships have been received.

Xu Xueyu, the general manager of the bureau, issued a notice the day before yesterday, saying that all newly received ships should be sorted out and prepared from the date of receipt and sail within a week.</p>
<h3>XU CHONGZHI ARRIVES IN SHANGHAI FROM GUANGDONG, WAS SECRETLY IMPRISONED BY THE ENEMY IN HONG KONG AND VOWED TO NEVER YIELD</h3>
<p>(Our newspaper) Xu Chongzhi, a senior member of the Kuomintang and member of the Central Supervisory Committee, arrived in Shanghai from Guangdong the day before yesterday on a special plane sent by Chairman Jiang. When the Pacific War broke out, Xu was in Hong Kong and was secretly imprisoned by the enemy. He was determined not to waver, and the enemy could do nothing about it. After the victory, Xu returned to Guangzhou.</p>
<p>Chairman Jiang sent a telegram of condolence and sent a special plane to welcome him to Shanghai. He told this newspaper that he was very happy to be able to meet with compatriots and comrades in Shanghai this time. During the eight years of the Anti-Japanese War, compatriots across the country went through hardships, and finally, due to the unified reception of the spirit of Chairman Jiang, they worked hard and achieved the final victory. Chairman Jiang's leadership in the Anti-Japanese War will be forever recorded in history. As for the allied countries, the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union, especially the United States, gave our country spiritual and material assistance, which is worthy of admiration. However, our country urgently needs to recuperate and revitalize itself after the war in order to recover its vitality. I deeply hope that all parties and factions will sacrifice their own small interests and take care of the overall interests, unite in spirit, and earnestly implement the Three People's Principles of the founding father of the country to build a country of the people, by the people, and for the people. I also have high expectations for the United Nations organization and sincerely hope that the world can achieve a comprehensive, peaceful, and bright path. In the remaining years of my life, I have dedicated myself to the revolution for decades. As long as I have a breath, I will not dare to slacken in the hope of contributing to my country's rejuvenation and world peace.</p>

<h3>Ammunition Explosion During Transport Causes Dozens of Casualties</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] At 10:30 last night, an explosion involving rifle grenades occurred at the Japanese-owned Gong He Xiang Wharf on Daming Road, Hongkou, Huaji Road. It originated when U.S. Landing Ship No. 1015, tasked with transporting the New Sixth Army to the Northeast, was designated as the Fourth Transport Ship for that army. Last night, as ammunition was being loaded using a crane to hoist artillery shells onto the ship, three rifle grenades slipped and fell into the vessel during the crane's rotation. This triggered an immediate explosion, producing three loud booms. Smoke and fire quickly filled the area. American military police on the shore, hearing the blasts, rushed onto the ship and discovered a hole in the hull, about the size of a washbasin. Soldiers and workers lay injured or dead within the cabin. The military police, along with soldiers and workers from the New Sixth Army, evacuated the wounded to the deck and summoned ambulances for emergency treatment at hospitals. Among those admitted to the Public Concession Hospital were over thirty artillery battalion and 207th Division soldiers, including Lü Piqian, Chen Yinsheng, Tao Xinde, Ma Tiancai, Liu Daxiang, Li Shuliang, Ma Hengfang, Wang Tingyun, Yi Qingmen, Cao Zuozhi, Yang Yucheng, Zhang Xingde, Ma Tianfu, Li Zhexuan, and five laborers, including Zhou Hua.

<h3>Gold, Currency, and Securities: Black Market Discovered, Money Changers Watching</h3>
<p>The [gold] ingots still did not have any public buying and selling yesterday. The black market was sustained by both buyers and sellers transacting privately. The reported price of gold notes in the wartime capital of Chongqing was rising, and some were taking advantage of the lower prices to buy, while Sichuan traders were also making up for losses. Initially, the price was between 1.45 million and 1.50 million, then briefly rose to over 1.53 million. Yesterday, money changers also dared not continue operations. Overnight transactions made on the afternoon of the 14th were set to be settled immediately. Sellers, due to tight cash flow, secretly increased the overnight borrowing rate to 25%. This caused panic among the buyers, and selling pressure increased. Gradually, the price receded to below 1.4 million. At this time, employees of the National Bank were engaged in a work slowdown, making deposits and withdrawals inconvenient, which also had a significant impact. The price hit a low of 1.38 million before stabilizing slightly, fluctuating around 1.43 million in the afternoon. No official price for decorative gold was listed. There were rumors that silver shops might resume operations on Monday. Fine silver was priced at 1,600 [yuan], and silver ingots fluctuated between 790 and 840 yuan. Due to settlement activities among traders and high demand for cash, the overnight lending rate rose to between 20% and 25%. Banks were affected by the Four Banks and were reluctant to allow withdrawals.</p>
<p>The foreign currency market was even more subdued yesterday. Money changers, fearing investigations by the authorities, almost entirely refrained from trading. On the black market, U.S. dollars initially traded at 2,000 to 2,050 yuan, peaked at 2,050 to 2,080 yuan, and then fell back to 1,980 to 2,000 yuan before finally settling at 2,000 to 2,030 yuan. Hong Kong dollars were slightly weaker because news from Hong Kong indicated that the national currency was quoted at 39 (equivalent to over 256 Hong Kong dollars), with a remittance rate of 80%, roughly equivalent to 320 yuan in Shanghai. As a result, old Hong Kong dollar notes were priced at around 240 yuan, while Hong Kong telegrams, due to demand from cotton yarn traders, were priced at around 305 yuan. New Hong Kong dollar notes attracted little attention.</p>
<p>There was some buying and selling of Class C government bonds, with prices around 1,650 yuan. There was also some interest in local stocks at lower prices on the black market. Yong Yarn traded at around 2,000 to 2,100 yuan, Mei Ya at 1,500 to 1,600 yuan, Jingfu at 100 to 110 yuan, Xinguang at 92 to 95 yuan, and Qinxing at 80 to 85 yuan. Foreign stocks remained quiet.</p>
<h3>Rice and Flour Prices Rise Again</h3>
<p>Yesterday's rice market saw shops selling off their stock, with most transactions being retail sales. Prices rebounded by 400 to 500 yuan. Flour prices also increased by 200 to 300 yuan. Soybeans were firm, and high-quality raw peanuts saw price increases, while medium and lower grades remained stable. Soybean cakes increased by over 100 yuan, and wheat bran remained unchanged. Crude oil prices rose by 1,000 yuan, while soybean oil was stable. The prices of various grains fluctuated, showing a wavering pattern.</p>
<h3>Yarn Prices Rise Slightly, Cotton Cloth Market Dull</h3>
<p>Yesterday's yarn market saw ups and downs. In the morning, buoyed by the rebound from the previous day, prices jumped by 80,000 yuan. 20-count Blue Phoenix yarn was quoted at 1 million yuan again. However, due to extremely tight credit conditions and a strong desire to sell among small traders, prices gradually declined, closing at a low of 920,000 yuan for the day. Trading volume was light overall. Traders from Nanjing and inland areas showed slight interest in smaller quantities of 20-count yarn. Overall, closing prices were only slightly higher, by about 20,000 to 30,000 yuan, compared to the previous day.</p>
<p>The cotton cloth market was even more dull due to the Saturday factor. Both manufacturers and traders adopted a wait-and-see attitude. Only the Textile Construction Company purchased 32-count raw materials. Fine villus cotton from San Yu Town was priced at 92,000 yuan, delivered to the factory. Other factories did not conduct any transactions.</p>
<p>Customer demand for cotton cloth has temporarily ceased, causing prices to decline. However, dyeing and weaving factories are facing increasing fuel costs and want to increase sales prices, but market demand is lacking. They are forced to lower prices to maintain profitability, creating a difficult situation. The supply of gray cloth has recently loosened, so many dyeing and weaving factories are reportedly starting operations. It is also reported that the China Textile Construction Company only sold hemp and wool miscellaneous items yesterday.</p>
<h3>American Fruit Arrives in Shanghai</h3>
<p>The supply of American fruit was cut off after the Japanese invasion of the South, lasting for over six years. It is now learned that the American President Lines ship "Grant" arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday, carrying oranges and lemons totaling 4,200 boxes, shipped from San Francisco. This is the first shipment of fruit to arrive in Shanghai since the end of the war.</p>
<h3>U.S. Needs Raw Silk</h3>
<p>According to Associated Press, the United States is currently experiencing a severe shortage of silk stockings and urgently needs 10,000 bales of silk to manufacture 20 million pairs of silk stockings to meet market demand. Stocking manufacturers have requested the government to immediately import silk from Japan to alleviate the shortage of raw materials for stocking production.</p>
<h3>Coal Market's Rising Trend Declines</h3>
<p>The coal market has seen intense price increases in recent days. Some speculation is inevitable, and sellers believe that the price increase has reached saturation. It's an opportune time to sell. Furthermore, the authorities are cracking down on speculation, making people nervous. Therefore, sales of white coal lumps and other slow-moving items have seen price declines. Demand for bituminous coal dust from factories remains strong, with continued progress. The supply of charcoal is steady, and prices are stable. The supply of firewood from production areas is tight, and prices are rising. In particular, the supply of miscellaneous firewood and chestnut firewood to Shanghai is limited, causing significant price increases.</p>
<h3>Commercial News Agency to Increase Subscribers Starting Tomorrow</h3>
<p>The local Commercial News Agency was established in 1937. After the victory of the War of Resistance against Japan, the Central Propaganda Department approved its news releases. The agency has updated its content, focusing on covering news from the industrial and commercial sectors and market conditions in various industries. In addition to the original major newspapers, it will also increase direct subscribers starting tomorrow (the 18th). The news will be delivered by special messenger before 4 p.m. daily.</p>

<p>Special Issue on Production and Construction</p>
<h3>Important Steps in Production and Construction: Talent Cooperation</h3>
<p>We routinely interact with the general industrial sector, and most people feel that the lack of talent has become a rather serious problem. Because for construction, talent must come first. Without talent, all good plans cannot be implemented.</p>
<p>Originally, there were many instances in our country of people not using what they had learned. The work they were engaged in was fundamentally not what they had previously studied or researched. During the War of Resistance, due to unstable living conditions, many people had to change careers. Thus, excellent specialized talents became ordinary merchants. When victory arrived and it was time to begin construction, there was a lack of talent to meet the current needs.</p>
<p>Many factories, in the early stages of the War of Resistance, relocated inland. When the War of Resistance ended and they hoped to rebuild in Shanghai, they not only lacked the economic strength, but also the sufficient talent to undertake the work of revitalization.</p>
<p>The cultivation of specialized talent is not something that can be achieved in a day. A well-rounded talent must possess both knowledge and experience. Therefore, losing a talent is equivalent to losing a significant asset.</p>
<p>From now on, in addition to intensifying the training of talent, we must also prevent existing talent from changing careers. The completion of this task requires a two-pronged approach: on the one hand, the industrial sector must find ways to stabilize the lives of specialized talent, enabling them to work with peace of mind and strive for progress; at the same time, employees must also understand that frequent career changes can only address the present. While the realization of this is also not to be neglected, it will not yield good results. Both sides should adopt close cooperation and consider the overall enterprise, because the success of future production and construction, in addition to economic conditions, can be said to depend primarily on the success of talent cooperation.</p>
<h3>Labor-Management Cooperation in England</h3>
<p>— Qing He</p>
<p>In order to understand the economic situation in England, I made a special trip there to investigate. What I discovered was that there was no sign of economic recession in the English industrial sector. Labor and management were able to cooperate thoroughly, making their industry active and full of vitality. English industrialists are also rallying their spirits to reorganize their businesses meticulously. From the beginning, labor and management used negotiation to resolve issues such as working hours and wages, from coal mines, agriculture, cotton industry, and construction to all small-scale enterprises. Obsolete union methods were uniformly corrected. Some regulations established during the war, although still applied, were improved to adapt to the environment of the construction era. In the committees jointly formed by labor and management in five thousand factories, the combination of technical skills on the labor side and managerial skills on the management side produced great results.</p>
<p>They believe that the greatest goal is to improve the living standards of the British people. This goal is more important than any doctrine. Therefore, all bad old habits must be eliminated and situations that undermine work efficiency must be improved in order to produce the maximum possible output.</p>
<p>No one is more studied in British labor issues than Herbert Morrison, a Labor Party member of Parliament in the House of Commons. He said: "What our country needs is more national revenue to ensure that all workers have jobs. We must have huge exports and scientifically sound production. As long as we work hard, we can definitely achieve our goals. We must never think of ourselves, nor seek the satisfaction of only individuals or a party. If it should be state-owned, then it must be managed by the state; if it is suitable for private ownership, then it may as well be managed by the public."</p>
<p>Another leader of a labor group once said: "Although defeating capitalists can bring temporary pleasure, it is detrimental to the entire industry and to the production mechanism. In order to meet the production needs after the war, we must make both sides cooperate."</p>
<p>During World War II, British workers worked longer hours and in less favorable environments than during World War I, but the man-hours lost due to strikes were only one-fifth of those lost during World War I. This does not mean that workers have stopped demanding improved treatment, but that they have understood their responsibilities. They want to preserve the industrial goose so that it can lay many, many eggs.</p>
<p>Currently, the British labor organization is stronger than any other industrialized country, but they do not force every worker to join a union. The progress of British industry is due to two reasons: first, "initiative," and second, "mutual trust." Whether it is the labor side or the management side, they are able to consider the entire enterprise. I can cite two examples to illustrate this:</p>
<p>A director of a car manufacturing plant said: "In the past, we adopted a top-down management method, but currently, this method is no longer feasible." Because he has abandoned the method of exclusive control by the management. I visited a factory in Manchester, where the workers told me that in the past, each worker managed one locomotive. People automatically planned methods to save resources. Now, one worker can manage three locomotives, so production has greatly increased. British workers understand very well that if they want to get more income and enjoy a better life, they must first enable British industry to obtain more business.</p>
<p>British industrialist Cordard said: "British labor-management cooperation adopts a moderate approach to maximize efficiency. This awakening can be said to be a great achievement since the beginning of the mechanical age, and the future shows unlimited promise."</p>

<h3>The Neglected Handkerchief Manufacturing Industry</h3>
<p>— Yao Yinwei</p>
<p>Occupies an Important Position in the Weaving Industry</p>
<p>Of the necessities of life, clothing occupies a large part, but items such as handkerchiefs and socks are also indispensable. Everyone has a handkerchief, and its importance is no different from a pair of socks for each foot.</p>
<p>In the early years of the Republic of China, white and blue checkered silk handkerchiefs were popular, produced in Shengze. But at that time, people did not pay much attention to hygiene and lived simply, so most people overlooked and did not prepare them. Later, white gauze handkerchiefs from the East and the West, with beautiful colors, such as the British-made Tower Brand Pyramidn, Ideal, Colorbide, and the Czech-made Three Flower Brand Miracle, flooded the market and dominated it for more than ten years, earning countless money. Although there were domestic products at the time, they were very simple, just buying cloth, cutting, sewing, and that was it. Later, they were improved to print flowers on white cloth, and then further improved to dye the yarn into various colors to weave handkerchiefs. This was of course much more advanced than printing flowers. But compared to foreign goods, it was still far behind. Later, the dyeing and weaving industry rose, gradually making progress, which can be said to be the nascent stage of the handkerchief industry. When the European War broke out, foreign goods gradually disappeared. Seeing that the opportunity to promote domestic goods had arrived, I took on the arduous task of establishing the Huanqiu Handkerchief Weaving Factory, with the aim of eliminating the crude and preserving the essential, being original, striving for glory for domestic goods, and competing with foreign goods. The first products to be released were the 100-count linen yarn Huanqiu Brand woven floral satin striped handkerchiefs and Safety Brand satin striped handkerchiefs. Then, double-sided satin striped handkerchiefs were created. These handkerchiefs have satin stripes and delicate patterns on both the front and back, so they not only rivaled imported goods, but even surpassed them. Therefore, they sold well in various places, and the products became widely known. In the 31st year of the Republic of China, I felt that gifts for weddings, birthdays, and openings cost a lot of money and iron every year, so I studied diligently and invented the handkerchief flower basket in the autumn of that year, which caused a sensation. It was generally said to be beautiful and practical. Therefore, handkerchiefs had another outlet, and the number of fellow traders gradually increased. Up to now, there are more than ninety handkerchief traders. Daily production is increasing day by day. But the times are constantly progressing, and people's desires for material enjoyment and knowledge are also increasing day by day. Handkerchiefs are not only for practical use, but have also progressed to possessing decorative value. Therefore, the quality must be perfect, and the color is even more important.</p>
<p>Now the War of Resistance has been won, and industrial production is the most important core of national construction. Those engaged in industry should bury themselves in hard work and strive for construction. The leader urged: "The purpose of life is to improve the lives of all mankind, and the meaning of life is to create the life that succeeds the universe." It can indeed be taken as a goal to strive for. It is hoped that fellow traders will gradually improve the rudimentary mechanical equipment so that foreign goods cannot come and compete with us again. Furthermore, we must sell to foreign countries, compete in the global market, and encourage everyone to use domestic goods, reducing the number of outflows of money. The Father of the Nation declared: "We should use our decades of mortal life to lay the unshakable foundation of the nation for billions of years." I believe that production must be increased, and shoddy manufacturing is not allowed; construction must be successful, and failure is not allowed.</p>
<h3>The Realistic Problems of Industrial Recovery</h3>
<p>— Luo Liqun</p>
<p>Because of our country's backward production, large-scale industries, apart from those established by foreign businesses, are really scarce. The basic organization of all industrial production is supported by small and medium-sized factories. However, because of their weak capital, in addition to the necessary production equipment, the only financial resources they usually use are loans from money houses and credit debts between various industries to maintain and inject funds. However, because there are many small and medium-sized factories, and at the same time they can bury themselves in hard work, their contribution to the entire production mechanism is quite great.</p>
<p>But since the Japanese invaders occupied our country, after eight years of control and buying by the enemy and puppets, the originally weak small and medium-sized factories could not withstand the ravages of the fierce waves and were already exhausted. Although the War of Resistance has now been won and industrial recovery must be implemented, the capital reserves of small and medium-sized factories have been reduced to mere shells after being looted by the enemy and puppets. They are currently suppressed by high prices, making it very difficult to recover.</p>
<p>Therefore, the current realistic problem of industrial recovery is how to enable small and medium-sized factories to quickly resume operations, and how to enable them to develop and have large-scale production.</p>
<p>What is most needed now is economic assistance, because huge loans are not easy to obtain at present, and the habit of credit debt has also been broken. It is sincerely hoped that the government can consider this and quickly formulate a broad factory loan plan, so that small and medium-sized factories that have not started work can start as soon as possible, and those that are already producing can increase production. Then industrial recovery will not only be a pleasant slogan, but can become a reality.</p>
<h3>Coping with Difficulties</h3>
<p>— Chuan Liangjun</p>
<p>Xinguang Standard Underwear Dyeing, Weaving, and Finishing Factory has developed rapidly in recent years. Mr. Chuan Liangjun, the founder, has unique ways of handling various affairs. We have specially asked him to publish some of his insights on business management. This manuscript is beneficial for readers to learn from. — Editor</p>
<p>In the operation of any business, it is inevitable to encounter various difficulties. When encountering difficulties, one must calmly cope with them in order to overcome them and step into the stage of progress.</p>
<p>Taking Xinguang Standard Underwear Dyeing, Weaving, and Finishing Factory as an example, since its establishment to the present, it has encountered many difficulties, such as the interruption of transportation and the purchase of cotton cloth. These could have made Xinguang's past achievements come to naught. Fortunately, when difficulties arose, we used our best efforts to overcome them, and instead gained opportunities for progress.</p>
<p>The difficulties that will be encountered in the future will certainly be quite numerous, so we must always be prepared for the arrival of difficulties and find ways to cope with them.</p>
<p>To overcome difficulties, it is very important to focus all your attention on the business, because only when a person's energy is focused on one business can they have the strength to cope.</p>
<h3>Good News for the Silk Industry</h3>
<p>Before the Incident, most of our country's silk machinery was imported from Japan, and very little was made by Chinese people. After eight years of war, all silk factories in the sericulture area were almost completely destroyed. Although the government has been doing its best to revitalize the sericulture industry in order to develop silk exports, silk factories often suffer from the difficulty of not being able to procure machinery. Recently, it has been heard that Xu Tongzhao, Kong Haozhuang, and others, in response to the needs of the silk industry, purchased new-style machinery and established Tailai Iron Factory at No. 22, Lane 296, Bailinan Road, Shanghai. In addition to specializing in精 silk machinery, they also painstakingly research and manufacture machinery for silk reeling, silk weaving, spinning, weaving, tea making, etc., and provide planning for the complete equipment of various factories.</p>
<h3>State-Run Light Industry: China Textile Construction Company</h3>
<p>— Yi</p>
<p>Since its establishment, China Textile Construction Company has rapidly advanced its business and occupies a leading position in production and construction. In order to give all sectors of society a deeper understanding of the company, we interviewed Mr. Shu Yunzhang, the general manager of the company, and he provided various relevant materials.</p>
<p>China Textile Construction Company is a state-run light industry that can be divided into the following aspects.</p>
<p>Organizational Aspect</p>
<p>According to Article 1 of the company's articles of association, the company is organized in accordance with Article 8 of the Regulations on the Organization of the Textile Industry Management Committee of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, and is named China Textile Construction Company, translated into English as China Textile Industries Inc. The total capital, in addition to the assets of enemy and puppet yarn factories taken over by the Ministry of Economic Affairs at an estimated price, plus 1 billion yuan in national currency, is allocated in one lump sum by the Ministry of Economic Affairs. The selection of directors and supervisors is proposed by the Textile Industry Management Committee of the Ministry of Economic Affairs and approved by the Executive Yuan as follows: Vice President Weng will serve as chairman, and Shu Yunzhang, Li Shengbo, Wu Weijing, Yang Xiren, and Wang Yangxian, members of the Textile Management Committee, are designated as directors, and Zhang Zige and Wang Zijian are designated as supervisors. The head office is located at No. 138 Jiangxi Road, Shanghai, with branch offices in Tianjin and Qingdao.</p>
<p>Under the general manager, there are five departments: engineering, business, accounting, auditing, and secretarial. Among them, each of the four departments of engineering, business, accounting, and secretarial has one department head and one deputy department head. The auditing department has one chief auditor and one deputy chief auditor, all of whom are appointed by the board of directors upon the proposal of the general manager.</p>
<p>Current Progress</p>
<p>According to the company's articles of association, the scope of business is stipulated as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Manufacture and dyeing and finishing of textiles</p>
<p>(2) Purchase and sale of textile dyeing raw materials and finished products</p>
<p>(3) Manufacture and purchase and sale of textile dyeing machinery and parts</p>
<p>(4) Operation of matters related to the preceding three businesses</p>
<p>(5) Investment in other textile dyeing and finishing related businesses</p>
<p>As of now, the exact number of enemy and puppet textile factories taken over by the company is:</p>
<p>(1) Yarn factories: 19</p>
<p>(2) Wool spinning factories: 6 units</p>
<p>(3) Printing and dyeing factories: 6 units</p>
<p>(4) 製 factories: 2 units</p>
<p>(5) Silk spinning factories: 1 unit</p>
<p>(6) Machine factories: 1 unit</p>
<p>Among the yarn factories, except for three that have not started work due to excessive damage to machinery and buildings, the remaining sixteen have already started production. Among them, Neiwai No. 9 Factory and Dakang No. 2 Factory have started to work day and night shifts. In the shortest possible time, preparations are being made to fully open day and night shifts, so that the quantity of production can be doubled. As for the current production, it has exceeded 400,000 spindles, and it is expected that it can be expanded to more than 500,000 spindles within a month.</p>
<p>Employed Workers</p>
<p>As of now, the workers prepared for use in yarn factories total 4,042 male workers and 8,302 female workers. In wool spinning factories, there are a total of 530 male workers and 980 female workers. In printing and dyeing factories, there are a total of 723 male and female workers.</p>
<p>The working time for each shift per day is ten hours. If day and night shifts are opened, then it will work for a total of twenty hours.</p>
<p>Market Price Problem</p>
<p>Currently, because the source of raw materials is not yet smooth, the amount of production cannot be increased quickly. Recently, many people have advocated the complete use of domestic cotton, but based on the calculation of all four million yarn spindles in China being fully opened, each spindle needs two and a half dan of raw cotton per year, which would require a total of more than ten million dan of raw cotton. It is estimated that this year's national cotton production is less than five million dan. Because of transportation relations, it is feared that the actual cotton that can be supplied to yarn factories for production will be less than two million dan. Therefore, it is quite difficult to enable all spindles to be fully opened. Because the output is limited and the demand is high, especially when the price of gold skyrocketed a few days ago, the price of yarn rose accordingly. The company used its best efforts to seek peace, and only opened the price at the appropriate time (one or two hours later than the market price), so that speculators could not profit from it, and at the same time, it could stop the rising wind (for a few days, because the market price rose sharply, the company's price was too far apart, and there was a danger of being used by speculators. If it did not sell at all, it would only make the rising wind worse. Therefore, in order to take full account of reality, it had to increase the price, but it still had a considerable distance from the market price (but because of the output and the impact of the price of gold, the expected effect could not be achieved, but the company has done its best).</p>
<p>Future Policy</p>
<p>The future policy is that in order to prevent hoarding and encourage production of yarn and cloth, a large amount of barrel yarn is specially sold and directly allocated to various factories. In terms of sales, since it can supply real sales users, and in terms of market price, it can also have more control opportunities.</p>
<p>In terms of operation, in addition to the lack of raw materials, the lack of skilled workers is also a very serious problem, because a skilled worker needs at least three months of training time, so the company is cultivating a large number of skilled laborers in the process of production.</p>
<p>Burying Head in Hard Work</p>
<p>China Textile Construction Company is not as simple as an ordinary factory, because it takes over many factories at the same time, so the operation is quite heavy. Mr. Shu Yunzhang, the general manager of the company, pays attention to practice, does not advocate empty talk, and buries his head in hard work. In the future, he will definitely be able to move forward under circumstances where the environment permits.</p>
<h3>Major Increase in Production in the American Industrial Sector in 1946</h3>
<p>— Wen</p>
<p>At the beginning of 1946, the American industrial sector had an air of progressing into a prosperous era. Every person had greater purchasing power, and even those more conservative people were prepared to buy more things. In the past, American automobile manufacturers manufactured at most five million cars a year, but in 1946, they prepared to increase to six million cars.</p>
<p>Washing machine manufacturers produced at most 1.9 million units per year, and in 1946, the planned target was 2.5 million units. This increase in production was common to every industry, from clothing to soap powder, all preparing for mass production. (Recorded from the January 7th issue of Time magazine this year)</p>
