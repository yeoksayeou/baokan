<h3>東北蘇軍分批撤退　月底以前全部回國　馬林諾夫斯基離長春</h3>
<p>〔本報北平六日電〕官方訊：接收東北國軍，各路大有進展，現北抵昌圖，南達本溪，梁華盛刻在開原指揮，北寗路連日兵車極擁擠。代理東北保安司令鄭洞國，六日抵潘陽。</p>
<p>〔本報北平六日電〕傳長春蘇軍十五日可撤畢，如十五日前東北執行小組不能採取有效步驟，長春即將淪爲戰塲，刻長春四郊共軍雲集，傳九台已被攻陷，農安亦在共軍圍攻中。</p>
<p>〔中央社長春六日電〕馬林諾夫斯基元帥，六日上午十一時四十分乘車赴哈返國，我軍事代表團長董彥平，率全體團員到站歡送，該團團員張培哲，楊作人並隨車陪送馬氏至哈爾濱。</p>
<p>〔又電〕馬林諾夫斯基元帥今午離長前，曾在車站與我軍事代表幽長董彥平暢談四十分鐘，馬氏聲言渠在哈爾濱將有函週勾留，在蘇軍最後撤出北前，仍將與我軍事代表團保持連絡。據悉，馬氏今一再強調中蘇友好相處之重要性及必然性。</p>
<p>〔央社哈爾濱六日電〕馬元帥及特洛曾科並其總部人員，六日下午五時四十分抵哈。</p>
<p>〔中央社錦州五日電〕東北蘇軍正式宣布撤退日期，四月卅日前可全部撤至蘇聯國境，本月三日董彥平中將與特洛曾科中將會談時，特中將奉命宣布蘇軍撤退日期，（一）馬元帥總部之所有僚屬，四月五日離長春返國，長春蘇軍將於十四·十五兩日撒完，卡爾洛夫城防司令最後離長，市郊防疫崗哨，將於十日撤離。（二）哈爾濱蘇軍廿五日撤完。（三）吉林市三日至十六凡撤完。（四）齊齊哈爾廿六日或廿七日撤完。（五）牡丹江廿六日或廿九日撤完。（六）北安佳木斯勃利及其以北地區，十日以前亦可撤完，根據以上計劃，本月卅日前，蘇軍全部可以撤至蘇聯國境。</p>
<p>〔合衆社瀋陽六日電〕權威方面獲悉，美式配備之新一軍部隊，正向四平街擴大其推進之勢。同時此間獲悉，蘇軍擬於四月十四日前全部撤離長春，共軍曾岡遏阻四平街國軍之前進，並增加其在長春區內之兵力，彼等顯欲在蘇軍完成撤退時，佔據長春。此項行動，已阻滯新一軍主力之推進，並使其到達長春之舉受阻，惟爲數甚多之國軍，刻已越渦四平街之鐵路封銷綫，大部係步行，亦有乘車而過者，謀於共軍力能克服就地警備郃隊之前到達該城。據最近估計，長春國軍共有七千人，其中包括數月前自北平區空運前往之國軍一千名，當地民團三千名與警察三千名。</p>
<p>〔中央社漢城五日合衆電〕據韓北來客談：蘇軍約五萬人，自中國東北開入韓國蘇軍佔領區，目前韓北之蘇軍總數，的爲十萬零六千人。平壤與北緯三十八度問之蘇軍，調動頻繁，該區蘇軍約有四萬人。</p>
<p>長春四面被包圍　市內保安隊加強防禦工作</p>
<p>〔中央社長春六日電〕長春現已被共軍四面包圍，其前鋒距長春最近者僅八公里。此外城南廿公里之處，城西十二公里之靠山屯，城東南十五公里之勸頭台及十二公里半之香水泉，均已駐滿共軍，而城北則成爲由德惠開來之共軍出沒地。至在市內潛伏者，尙不可估量，市內保安隊所築之防禦工作，正積極擴展及加强中。</p>
<p>〔又電〕長春周圍共軍，現仍繼續增加中，四日至五日，長春以北之布海哈拉哈兩地，即已增述二萬六千人，聞均係自哈爾濱變城等方面由火車輸送南下者，四日共軍並將布海之護路隊繳械。</p>
<p>〔中央社瀋陽六日電〕嫩江省所屬之林甸富裕兩縣城，已被共產軍攻陷。又該省政府所在地之齊齊哈爾，刻已陷於被包圍之形勢。</p>
<p>〔合衆社重慶六日電〕此間觀察家刻正密切注意未來十日中東北局勢之發展情形，認爲此事與未來數年之局勢有重太關係。蘇軍準備於四月底撤盡，頃己將其撤退步驟通知中國當局，內容如何，尙未披露，此項通知可能使國軍在共軍未抵達前接收東北各重要城市，　蘇軍不能將主要城市交與國軍，則中蘇關係可能因此轉趨緊張。執行小組之是否赴東北工作，內戰是否將爆發，或以解決爭端之方法而予以消弭，大致在未來十日中，亦能有所決定。</p>

<h3>軍事三人商討　尚未獲得協議</h3>
<p>〔本報北平六日電〕渝軍事三人小組，六日仍未來，顯示解決東北問題之詳細方案，恐尙朱獲得協議，但東北執行小組則可不待三人小組北來，而先行出發，因美方白魯德將軍對此事催促甚急，甚願早睹東北和平實現也。又三人小組到瀋後，瀋陽中心小組亦可能改爲調處執行部車北分部。</p>
<p>〔聯合社重慶六日電〕軍事三人小組。政府，中共及美方代表，本擬赴東北一行，但迄未成行，其原因有二，（一）委員會對如何處理東北問題基本意見未趨一致，（二）政府代表陳誠現患劇烈胃病，可靠方面稱：政府或將另派代表，委員會應先舉行會議，使雙方對爭執各點意見一致，否則三代表赴東北，亦無意義。</p>
<p>〔合衆社瀋陽五日電〕自魯德准將今日飛往往東北之主要目的，乃欲自共黨方面獲得若干保證，以滿足政府方面之希望。蓋政府方面之意見，似爲東北境內並無任何眞正共軍之活動，所有者，「僅游擊隊與土匪」也。</p>
<h3>蘇聯行政官員　不允退出撫順</h3>
<p>長春傢俱搬運一空</p>
<p>〔合衆社撫順六日電〕蘇聯行政官員廿三人，今日仍在滿布鐵絲網之防禦工程後，「盤踞」於撫順市之最佳巨厦中，於其致送撫順區佔領軍第五十二軍軍長趙公武將軍之照會內，蘇方官員堅稱在雅爾達協定之下，整個撫順煤礦區，包括地下礦穴兩處，及全球上產量最豐之地面礦穴兩處，均應屬諸長春鐵路公司，長鐵本歸中蘇合營，今由蘇聯單獨管理。蘇聯官員廿三人，皆着長鐵制服，凡中當局所提撤退之要求，彼等例以堅定之語詞答謂：「在未獲史達林撤退令之前，予等不願撤去。」</p>
<p>〔聯合社撫順六日電〕蘇聯已使撫順煤礦市成爲瀋陽第二，其煤礦及電廠中之重要機器與設備，均被拆除，使此東九省南部工業鎖　，實際上沉寂如睡。各礦自經蘇軍佔領，其每日所產烟煤，已由一萬噸减至一千噸。</p>
<p>〔中央社長春五日電〕一般預料，一俟時局安定，傢具商尤其木器商之生意，必甚興隆，而各種木器及木料之價格，亦必昂貴，蓋日前市內各火建築物之傢具門窗，已被搬運一空，連日車站上之棹椅·床舖·沙發·地　·衣櫉·屛風乃至衣架·茶几等等，堆積如山，火車運輸甚爲頻繁，而滿載之十輪卡車，仍源源往站上輸送。</p>

<p>星期論壇</p>
<h3>英法同盟的趨勢　與巴黎和會的前途</h3>
<p>— 儲玉坤</p>
<p>英法恢復同盟關係，已由醞釀而至成熟階段了。先是法國臨時總統兼內閣總理顧盎發表演說，闡明法國的外交政策稱二「法國必須設法成立英法同盟，作爲法蘇同盟的補充。假如因爲這種同盟條約，而能進一步締結三强條約那是更加有益的事。」接着，法國社會黨舉行大會，也表示擁護顧盎總統所發表立即恢復英法同盟的主張，並在其吿法國民衆書中稱：「法國應與英國簽訂與法蘇同盟條約同樣性質的條約，藉以增强英法兩國人民在政治上經濟上之合作。」在英國方面，立即引起共鳴，歡迎英法同盟的實現。因此，貝文外相也在下議院宣佈，英國政府素願與法國保持密切關係，並深信英法兩國關係，至適當時期，即可因簽訂與法蘇同盟條約類似性質之條約而大見增强，故此種條約實爲防制再受侵略之保障。」英法兩國旣心心相印如此，英法恢復同盟關係，當不難實現，自不待言。何况外界又有貝文外相將赴巴黎訪問法國朝野的消息，於是大家推測，英法締結同盟，早則於四月內就可實現，遲到五月一日巴黎和會開幕的前夕，同盟條約或可在巴黎簽字。</p>
<p>英法同盟，原是兩國的傳統關係。在第一次世界大戰前，英法在互相讓步互相妥協約條件之下成立兩國協商；後來在第一次世界大戰之中，駢眉作戰，風雨同舟，終於獲得最後勝利。迨大戰結束之後，因爲英法的利害，在許多塲合未能趨於一致，於是步調異趨。法國企圖稱將歐洲大陸，而英國的對歐政策則以「均勢」爲基調，乃逐漸不能通力合作。可是英法的分裂，徒然有利於第三者，納粹德國與法西斯的義大利就乘機而起，蓄意侵略，使整個歐洲陷於戰爭威脅之中，幾乎造成一夕數驚的局面。後來英法看到歐洲政局一天嚴重一天，始復釋嫌言好，重中英法同盟的傳統關係，並且採取共同一致的反侵略政策，雖嫌爲時已晚，而終能於同一時間以同一方式對德宣戰，究不失爲明智之舉。但是不幸，法國在第二次世界大戰中，却演出了一幕時代的大悲劇，以歐洲盟主的地位，抵抗德軍的侵襲，未及一月，即吿崩潰，竟向希特勒低頭，任其宰割！幸有愛國志士戴高樂將軍，登高一呼，領導抵抗運動，並在倫敦組織法國流亡政府，由於得英國之協助，更進而得美國之支持，聲勢日見浩大，終於挽回法國的厄運，在大戰之後仍能處於五强之一。</p>
<p>由此可知英法關係的密切。但是在這一次世界大戰之後，爲什麽迄今還沒有正式締結盟約呢？並且最令人詫異的是法蘇同盟條約與英蘇友好條約均已成立，而獨有英法同盟條約未能簽字，個中原因究竟在那裏呢？我們分析的結果，戰後英法對於若干歐洲問題，仍抱着不同的見解：最明顯的有：（一）西班牙問題，法國認爲弗朗哥政權的存在足以危及世界和平，故要求把這個問題提交聯合國安全理事會處理。但是英國僅在原則上反對弗朗哥政權，却不主張出而干涉西班牙的內政，因得美國的贊助，使法國的願望一時無法實現。（二）對於德國西陲邊界問題，法國堅決主張要把魯爾區萊因河與德國分離，尤其要把魯爾區出產的煤斤供給法國應用。前人民陣綫內閣總理勃魯姆到美國去訪問，其主要目的，也就在使美國朝野贊成法國的這一項主張。此在英國，則對於戰敗的德國如何處置，主張要協約國共同討論，共同解決。（三）近東問題，也是英法意見參差的地方。但是到了最近，英法雙方均已同意，自黎巴嫩叙利亞兩國撤兵，英國首先實行，法國也如期踐的，大體也就沒有間題了。</p>
<p>在英法兩國之間，旣然有這些問題尙待解決，所以戴高樂將軍堅持在簽訂同盟條約之前，必須先解決兩國間所有的縣案，作爲英法同盟條約的基礎。但是英國方面，則希望法國先訂一般性質的條約，用明文規定各項目標，如此，其他各項問題也就迎刃而解了。這是英法兩國意見不同的地方，也就是英法同盟條約遲遲不能簽字的原因。可是最近一月來國際的發展，使英法雙方均感有早日恢扳同盟條約的必要。就法國方面而論，法國雖與蘇聯訂有友好同盟條約，但在歐洲所處地位仍感孤立，尤其是如何對付德國侵略勢力的再起，感到極大的焦慮。何况從北歐諸國起，所有波羅的海沿岸各國以及巴爾幹半島各國，均已在蘇聯勢力控制之下，故在跌蘇之間，幾已失去平衡，無論如何，法蘇已不能再像戰前處於平等的地位。因此，法國很想英法同盟早日實現，俾能將法蘇·英蘇·英法三種條約化而爲三强條約，這樣，法國才有安全可言。此在英國，看到蘇聯在歐洲大陸的勢力過分膨脹，東歐集團在無形之中早已成立，英國爲保持歐陸的均勢起見，也不得不拉攏法國，締結同盟，然後再叫西歐其餘國家如荷蘭比利時等參加，也就在無形之中組成了西歐集團，足與蘇聯領導的東歐集團相頡頏了。現在法國旣然首先發動英法同盟的主張，英國自然也樂觀厥成了。</p>
<p>所以英法在和平會議開幕之前締結同盟條約，對於歐洲政局曁和平會議的前途，都有非常密切的關係，從悲觀方面去觀察，蘇聯看到英法同盟，能否不視爲西歐集團的前身，確是一個嚴重的問題。屆時，蘇聯對於法國的態度，如不免也要改變，則在和會中，蘇聯可能採取不妥協態度。由此，我們對於五月一日在巴黎舉行的和平會議，實在不敢過分樂觀。外長會議旣已流產，蘇聯對於巴爾幹半島的利益又不肯放鬆一步，我們怎能希望這種會議能產生具體的結果來呢？反之，從光明方面去觀察，英蘇關係如能好轉，蘇聯對於英法同盟也能完全諒解，且願將此種同盟條約擴大成爲三强條約，則英法同盟對於世界和平，必有許多貢獻，而巴黎和會也能順利進行了。</p>

<h3>參議員昨在九次大會中　質詢本市預算決算　盼坦步防止漏稅涓滴歸公　鱘花稅祇有小額票要求改善</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市臨時參議會昨晨九時二十分，舉行第九次大會，出席參議員三十四人，由財政局局長浦拯東報吿財政情况：</p>
<p>財政局報告</p>
<p>過去財政：根據民國二十五年度，舊市府收入爲一〇，三二〇，〇〇〇元，支出一一，〇六〇，〇〇〇元，舊英工部局收入二三，六五一，七一〇元，支出二七，五四五，三九一元，舊法公審局收入九，七五九，四〇六元，支出一一，六八七，七四一元。接收僞局；辦公用具，證券現金，均經詳報市府轉報中央解屢或保管之證券及現金計：各種凍結匯票，僞福利委員會各項有價證券及銀行存款，前工部局有價證券，上海恒產股份有限公司股票二〇〇，〇〇〇股，各種公債共五，二六三股，現金計僞鈔一八，二三六，八三七，八八四元。稅收項目：筵席稅百分之二十，娛樂稅百分之五〇，房捐稅照二十六年佔定砠價加成六十倍征收百分之十四，營業牌照稅，若資本現値百分之〇·五不能佔計時，按營業額總全年百分之〇·二五，使用牌照稅，按車輛種類及載重量計算，屠宰稅百分之五，旅棧捐百分之二十。淸査完竣從新召租之房屋計四一五幢，及浦東市　里房屋五十幢。淸査舊市府，英法公董局及僞組織公債共計一二七，七五四，八七六，二四元。財局自去年九月至本年二月收入共計三，三一五，一三七，四二三元，支出則爲七，三五二，六三二，六六三元。計市府總務處佔百分之九·二四，會計處一·三六，民政處二·九五，警察局三二·〇三，財政局三·六一，敎育局七·八四，公用局六·八七，工務局一四·二九，衛生局一〇·五一，社會局一·八八，地政局四·六七，其他佔百分之四一七五。克服當前困難計劃：（一）確定收支總預算，减少或停止不急之支出，（二）緊催中央淸發復員後應撥各項欠款，（三）從速實施新定財政收支系統，（四）請撥敵僞物査趕辦急切建設，（五）淸理公有款產，組設專管機構，（六）繼續整理稅捐，培養稅務人才，（七）實施地方遺產，舉行勞動服務，（八）調節市面，扶掖工商各業。浦局長報吿元畢後，在提出質詢前，馮有眞臨時動議，謂大會開幕在即，應將經過情形發表宣言，提議組成一起草委員會·推徐永祚·馮有眞·傳統先·陳訓悆·及潘序倫五位，爲起草委員，一致通過。</p>
<p>各參員質詢</p>
<p>詹文滸詢問：（一）市府擬請求接收一部份敵僞物資，以作建設之用，何不即以敵產處理局拍賣後所得款項，請求提出一部份以充實市庫。市府預算能否公布？（二）發行市公債有何計劃？徐永祚亦要求將二月底後預算情形發表，照市臨時參議會組織條例，參議員最要任務在議決預算，審核決算。潘序倫審査報吿，發現敎育局支出佔百分之七·八四，實在太少，工務局佔百分之十四·二九，亦應大爲增加，而總務費佔九·二四，公用局佔六·八七，則似乎太多。營業牌照稅，有妨碍市民發展營業之作用，應予取消。曹俊謂財局雖說竭力防止漏稅，而據報吿，其中屠宰稅一項即頗有出入。希望進一步做到涓滴歸公，嚴禁徵收人員舞弊。永祥雲提出印花稅票市上祗有額雅者出售，浪費紙張時間，能否發售大額票？季灝主張保衛團組織儘量縮小，以减輕市民負擔。馮有眞對於臨時參議員，是否有權審核決算預算，認爲値得考慮。</p>
<p>浦局長答覆</p>
<p>浦局長答覆各點：（一）敵僞物資出賣款項，撥劃市庫一點，已有計劃。（二）目前利息如此高，辦理公債很困難，暫時不能發行。（三）預算已於去年編製，因佔計與目前事實大有出入，且尙未經中央核定，故未曾發表，彌補款項，乃由中央陸續零星撥給，（四）營業牌照稅，其作用在取締及减少奢侈營業，乃中央所定，正請示財政部核定。屠宰稅已有半年，未加調整，自有出入之處。大會於十一時四十五分散。</p>
<p>十次大會討論提案</p>
<p>市臨時參議會中，市府各局報吿，已於昨日上午完畢，下午三時十五分，舉行第十次大會，由大會全體審査各提案，到會參議員二十八人，余稺敬參議員已報到，又李登輝參議員呈請辭職，由徐國懋參議員　補，亦已報到。徐寄廎議長首先提出第三組審査會審査有關敎育文化各案，向大會報吿並請議決：結果通過（一）速令佔用校舍之一切機關部隊等迅即遷讓，（二）撥給充分經費，補助私立學校，（三）請敎育局利用市內市立中小學現有校舍及設備，廣設各級普通及職業補習學校，（四）小學敎育應以國文爲主，英文爲不重要之功課，由呂思潭提議將「英文」改爲「外國文」等案。第二組審査會提出審査關於財政，經濟，建設等議案，運過（一）請由本會建議中央迅速訂頒「都市房屋租賃管理條例」，以調節都市房屋之租賃，而减少其糾紛困難。（二）以本會名義，電請小央，將處理上海市區以內敵僞產業所得收入，劃撥一部份與上海市，作爲地方復興及建設經費，（三）請市府規建浦江隧道，以利浦江西岸交通（四）本市敵產碼頭會庫，應請行政院撥歸上海市府接管，（五）請遏止投機，誘導投資，安定社會經濟，主張先行核准證券交易所復業，（六）請求中央迅將接收之敵僞工廠，趕速開工，並鼓勵民營工廠復業，以容納失業工人而資增加生產（七）請市府積極開發郊區，（八）請市府會同警備司令部，迅速請査被佔房屋，公平分配居住，以解決目前本市最嚴重之房荒，（九）市長交議，市庫極度支絀，擬繼續征旅棧捐等案。至六時半散會，其他未議決提案，下次大會再行討論。</p>

<p>運用公會組織　處理敵偽物資</p>
<p>駱淸華提議敵偽產業處理局，雖有絕少數工商名流，參與審議委員會，而處理物資，僅知信賴三五百貨公司，始終不知運用上海市商會及各業公會之組織力量，以致曠日持久，治絲益棼，實堪惋嘆。迄至今日不但物資損失可痛，而倉庫久封，致救濟總署之運滬物資，與不久內地茶繭等土產外運，均將無處堆存，故處理接收物資肅淸封存倉庫，已爲緩無可緩之事，竊為惟有翻然變計，運用各業組織，協同處理，爰擬建議政府迅作如下之緊急措置：一，責成倉庫業報關業，推派人員，協同海關及商品檢騐局人員，限期淸査各倉庫封存物資，分類造册，公布數量。二，擴大審議委員會之組織，延攬重要各業公正人士充任委員，重行檢討修訂處理辦法。三·由審議委員會將封存物資，分類議定處理辦法，並隨時估定最低最高價格公布。四·分類交由各該本業同業公會，限期出售封存物資，核定經售商合法利潤，不准抬價操縱，並防止業外人套購囤積。五。如係工業原料，本業廠商，有優先配購之權，並規定得適用承兌保證分期付款等辦法。六·由審議委員會議定分類肅淸期限，如滿期尙未售淸，則减低估價，或公開拍賣，限期結束，如届時仍有劣次貨品，未能售盡，則移交市政府接管。時氏另一提議，爲紀念美故總統羅斯福氏，擬請　政府將本市南京西路之跑馬廳，改為羅斯福公園，豎立紀念碑，以資，宗仰，而垂久遠案。</p>
<h3>無獨有偶　麻袋中盛　大宗槍彈</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕前日淸晨七時許，威海衛路三三五弄垃圾桶旁，發現一蔴袋，內　子彈六百七十餘粒，經新成分局便衣隊査獲，後携圖分局存案。又昨晨黎明六時，該局警隊搜檢行人，在新閘路新昌路弄口，發現有蔴袋四只，內裝木柄手溜彈二十餘只，步槍子彈四千餘發，均經帶回隊部，解送警備司令部。</p>
<h3>各機關需用房屋須經行政院核定　處理敵偽產業審議會昨通過</h3>
<p>蘇浙皖區處理敵僞產業審議會，昨日通過：按收敵僞房地產，奉令迅速標售，凡各機關團體需用房地產者，須逕呈請行政院核定撥川。過去敵僞產業處理局房地產運用委員會議決，撥用或撥租各機關團體房地產，均係暫時性質。該項房地產一經標售，租片機關團體即須遷讓。</p>
<h3>招商局船票　黑市轉售牟利</h3>
<p>票局主人職員等被拘</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕招商局對各綫船票，爲杜絕黑市起見，購票時須木人親自簽字。靑津台粤等票，並需照片，以免轉售之弊。但各機關來函介紹或預定者，紛紛不絕，客票部幾無法應付。據悉舟山輪上次駛甬，宣吿客滿。有某機關運務組馬某，假借職務上之關係，經向招商局客運處商購舟山輪船票五張，售於某小票局，以黑市價轉售旅客。經該局外勤組査獲，報吿當局，轉請憲兵隊澈査。該隊將售票局之女主人職員等拘押究詢。該票局旋乞援馬某，馬自認爲某機關之職員，前往憲兵隊作保，擬將收押之票局女主人等保釋。憲兵隊時已偵得馬亦係罪犯，正攤拘拿，當被扣留，俟偵査後，即移法院究辦。聞該局嗣後購票，非本人親自到局，不予出賣。</p>

<h3>美鈔呆滯　港票平穩</h3>
<p>外幣美鈔呆滯，初時在一九二〇元左右，中途曾退入一九〇〇元關內，午刻稍定，午後亦然，在一九一〇元左右徘徊，結果較前收跌十元，港票平穩，中途微堅，但以老貨結款沈靜，未能越過四百大關，最後又盤，結果蛟前收無甚榮辱，羅比港電平而靜，成交不多。</p>

<h3>草綠色呢羢堅挺</h3>
<p>草綠顏色嗶嘰及華達呢，邇來市氣挺秀，零躉行情堅固，因市上流通正式之貨甚缺，其前敵產接收之有限貨品，至今亦已開派漸罄，且大半均係絲頭及人造棉者，如五百號者均由中紡改染藏靑派出，致草綠色嗶嘰與呢絨均見缺乏堅挺，而南京，安慶，蕪湖，杭州帮等採辦蟬聯，亦一主要原因也。</p>
<h3>紗花均無起色</h3>
<p>昨日紗市仍乏進展，緣銷路沉寂，僅京蕪來客辦去少數廿支小型紗三數十件，湘漢兩帮本月份以來，迄無動靜，粤客去胃亦滯，是以市塲成交殊稀，絕無生氣，各支紗又降二三萬元之譜，聞各大紗廠供售有意，惜買受乏人，揆之目下紗市，如無客帮大量拖買，殊不易展作，紡建昨開售呢羢十八種，毛毯二種，縫線四種。</p>
<p>昨日紐約美棉報漲八至十八磅音，中期有漲廿四磅音者，計近期美金二八·〇四，遠期二八·二四，已呈近低遠高之局，米特林現貨二八·六三，本埠現棉交易尙佳，惟市况因紗布情况無起色，受其牽制，約小一二千元。</p>

<h3>建築五金疲落</h3>
<p>柏油及汕　較前俏利</p>
<p>近來建築五金，貨價升降不一，大體言之，跌多漲少，如白鐵水泥竹節鋼條等，行情皆較前爲小，三六尺平白鐵，因江海關拋貨充斥，市塲買價遂大受挫折，水泥自有天津馬牌桶裝水泥到滬後，市况一落千丈，本街廠貨備受打擊，迄今仍乏轉機，竹節鋼條市，存貨尙豐，面實銷甚慰，行情遂呈軟化，他若柏油及油毛　，則較前俏利，尤以美國二號油毛　鋒芒爲最，較初到時好起十分之六，緣該貨市上所存旣少，而近日實銷頗盛，因此愈售愈稀，刻零售每捲需六萬五六千元，柏油因德士古供應較少，而本街實銷甚宏，市價乃見抬頭，又內地下柏油去路較屋須爲鉅，故買價遂現倒掛之勢。</p>

<h3>從財政數字看紐約</h3>
<p>— 三月十一日紐約航訊　本報特約記者朱家讀寄</p>
<p>來這大城已逾二月，若使由其表面繁　而觀，實猶不能認識紐約，因此，今天想從這城市的管理機能上觀察，特別一探究這「庶政之母」之財政預算，看他們的當局，本着什麽樣的政策，在維持和推動這樣一個局面。</p>
<p>說來也怪，這富甲全球華爾街專界金庫所在的大紐約，市政府每年　起全年預算，居然也要鬧窮，收支也平衡不過來，不能不出之借債了。以往的宿債已經相當大，眼看今年的難關仍在，這是新市長奧祖華（QDwyer）首感頭痛的事。將來的出路，不外　州政府補助及加繳稅收，可是美國的立法手續繁瑣，正不知何日可有分曉。現在且看看他們的收支分配，或可供我參鑑。</p>
<p>全年預算數字　一部分無着落</p>
<p>據最近紐的的市民預算委員會副會長格列姆（Peter　Grimm）發表，今年紐約市全年預算數字，計共八萬六千三百萬，內一萬萬現在全無着落，市長計擬增稅以挹注之。運筆數字的用法，格氏亦分括八項，並列百分數如后：</p>
<p>債務　二二·七</p>
<p>敎育二〇·三</p>
<p>福利醫院保健　一六·五</p>
<p>警察　九·一</p>
<p>火政五</p>
<p>五·一</p>
<p>衛生　四·五</p>
<p>給水　〇·七</p>
<p>其他〔包括行政費〕二一·一</p>
<p>共計　一〇〇·〇</p>
<p>依上統計，可見紐約市一年還債付息數字，竟列前茅，歷年虧空，確堪驚人。其次當算行政費，佔總數百分之二一·一·其中主要開支，當屬機關辦公費薪給費，而公國圖書館等經費，亦在其內。第三位算到敎育，佔百分之二〇·三，因此，在紐約的兒產和靑年，比之美國其他各地都要享受高。在戰時紐約城負担每個學生每年費用一百八十二元八角，較之洛杉磯的一五九·四·及第特律的一一五·三九，都勝一籌。不過，分析其花錢去向，這數達一百五十五萬之譜的金圓，其中百分之八十五也即用在三萬三干個教職員的身上，其餘百分之十五才是管理修繕及購置什用，然亦足見他們教職人員的待遇，是在怎樣一種可想像的水準上。</p>
<p>厚給着勵忠勤　警政淸明有效</p>
<p>次言警察，現在人數共約一萬四千名，實在不够。市長已允准將來增至一萬九千人，這幾天，正在招考，應考者達萬餘人。其中勤務分門別類，自難細說，而在馬路上的，跟其他大都市一樣，却都少見。據說這些警察，無論他是怎樣一個小角色，平均年俸俱在三千四百二十元之譜，還有其他津貼收入，普通可有五千一年。這裏的獎金特別多，去年一年警局所付獎金一項，即達一千五百萬元之鉅，他們的警政所以比較能淸明而著效率，厚給養，勵忠勤，當然大有關係。講到火政，這座紐約城據說也不過養着八千救火員，平均每一人配置百多幢大厦，不過因爲火警多，業務繁，全是消費支出，而水陸救火員才能出衆，薪給憮卹亦很優厚，致所佔市預算數字，也在百分之五以上。</p>
<p>社會福利事業　側重救濟工作</p>
<p>紐約城的社會福利。偏重於社會救濟性質，如資助不能自給之老人，療治酒徒，及供應照管盲人等。此外，有二十七所市營醫院，內設二萬〇五百張床位，以收容貧苦市民，每年耗去經費，的達五千萬。保健工作，注重飲食物檢査·單單牛奶一項·每天手續便相當繁重，據說通常以每％計共的三百五十萬單位，俱由衛生局逐一詳細檢騐，一直從牛身上滴下來到裝進瓶內。此外，衛生局的工作，復有花柳病治療，兒童診護及檢査十萬家食物及藥房，以故用人多，費用也便不能少。</p>
<p>還有衛生力面的百分之四·五預算，係用在垃圾及廢物之排除與處置。這些廢物，除了予以火化外，其中三分之一現在塡起了不少的地土。街市的潔凈也重要，但工人工資高，特別這裏常常大雪，一雪尺深，雖有掃雪車，仍得叫人幹，想這筆工金就必佔去一個可觀的數字。最後，給水雖然取償水價，然政府仍要酌支若干，故亦有千分之七之數。</p>
<p>以上是支出大槪。</p>
<p>大宗財政來源　是房地產稅收</p>
<p>再來看看收入方面如何呢？究竟他們拿什麽做來源呢？據格氏分析，主要亦有五項，幷列百分比如次：</p>
<p>不動產稅　五五·六</p>
<p>普通收入　二六·三</p>
<p>州敎育補助　一二·二</p>
<p>聯邦福利補助　二·四</p>
<p>其他　三·五</p>
<p>觀上分析，紐的市的大宗財源，倒是吃在房地產老闆的身上。市政府對全市房地產分別估價，按百抽二元八角，無怪生財有道，撑了市財政半　天下。其次，普通收入一項，最要者為水稅，通常係就水表或屋宇計徵，後者無異對房地產的雙重稅。次爲販賣稅，現徽百分之一，所以你現在無論買什麽，都得另付稅款。去平一年統計，此稅收入四千一百萬，積沙成塔，至是又一實例。這裏要附帶說明的，就是市內收稅原不止此，惟如聯邦奢侈稅（如購買金筆金表皮件飾物等皆另徵百分之二十重稅。）汽車牌照汽油酒精所得稅等，均歸中央或州政府收入，市政府所能賴以充爲財源的，除了州及聯邦政府補助，還有一些公產收入。</p>
<p>經費相當尷尬　一時難於應付</p>
<p>可是，預算的收支槪况，雖已這樣安排，紐的市今年的短絀，仍然相當尶尬。舉其大要，有四個因素，不易應付：第一，是有關戰後復員，凡一萬二千至一萬五十個前在市府供職而曾服役的兵士，其中百分之九十，均要求復職。這筆預算，連戰時獎金在內，該達五千七百萬之鉅。再有因必需恢復或擴充戰前戰後各種市政設備所需，估計亦達一萬萬元以上。第二，要建築學校。公園·醫院·衛生所·以及整理溝渠系統，需款十八萬萬，再要新增經常費，亦年達七千六百萬元。第三，爲紐约的地下車，虧本亦實厲寄，每年　得賭上五千萬。目前的五分軍價，實太便宜。可是市長寗顧主張增加販賣稅，而力避加車價，前些時市參議會曾有人建議加二分。結果亦被否決，惟這亦確成了市財政一項重累。何况今年的「繁榮」光景不園，稅收是否仍能維持原狀，殊不可必，於是赤字預算，更成了問題，金園王城眞的鬧起財政恐慌來了。</p>
<p>據格氏說，照此趨勢惟有出之借貸一途，但說也嘔氣，紐約州對社的市的借債，定有限額，爲不超過五年不動產稅入平均數的百分之十，而就此範圍，已感狹窄，故勢須另闢蹊徑，或由州政府增加補助，或加租稅，或停止不急要之建設。當然，道些自有他們自己會打算，用不到我們費心，而我這篇通訊，只是藉此以略觀人家的辦法如何是已。（三月十一日）</p>

<p>物價已像一匹脫了覊的野馬，跳躍式的飛跑，迎頭也不回的。市民在苦惱中瘍下去了，而商人們却漸漸地爬了起來，帶着油嘴微笑着，他們想起去年勝利後商業蕭條約慘景，今又傲然不可一世了，可是貧苦的市民的須，却　物價的練索緊緊扣住，透不出一口氣來。</p>
<h3>野馬式物價　連頭也不回一下</h3>

<h3>打米店風潮　掀起了一幕悲劇</h3>
<p>從上面我們可以看到五十天內的物價，是飛漲得多麼狂！人們都呻吟在他的高壓之下，生活比戰爭中過得更苦了。</p>
<p>跟着物價在跳躍，米價也給溫州人抹上一層沉重的陰影。在二月中旬，米價還是維持在每千元十七八斤左右，可是受了物價的波動，米商們也黑起良心，把米都囤了起來，市面上供應就成了問題，可是溫州城區十四萬人可少不了米來維持生命的，需要量還是有定量的，於是米價便作跳躍式的高漲，到二月下旬，只有每千元七斤了，「米蛀虫」還是認爲在這春荒時節，米價看漲，以爲奇貨可居，把米囤着不糶，推說無米　市。在二十日那天，每千元七斤也買不到了，跑遍溫州城區，有錢買不到米。因此激起市民公憤，有人沿路敲着洋油箱，鼓動了全市一致罷市，有一批餓荒了的人們，便分批衝進白店白廠，擊毁了櫃台，籮筐，機器，什物……一時全城譁然，到處米店米廠，都被羣衆擁入，只見人聲鼎沸，穀米與　籮畚斗齊飛，風潮遍及全城每個角落。負有治安資任的警察局，雖也動負全體員警，出發彈壓，可是那些衣衫襤褸的警士，拖了古董步槍趕去，看到情緒激沸的羣衆，也不敢說半個不字，只好當作觀衆的身分，立在一旁作『壁上觀』了</p>
<h3>女孩失而復得　闔家破涕為笑</h3>
<p>— 四日航訊　首都警察廳寄</p>
<p>戰時重慶市警察局主任秘書鄕過楷氏，其最小女公子，於日前被一廚夫人收養之大女孩抱走，拋置於京市小火車道旁，旋又爲人移動抱走，經半日偵尋，失而復得，茲誌經過悄形如下：</p>
<p>鄭氏家眷，住於太平路中區警察局後進。三月二日近午，夫人張女士出外購物，令男僕老錢抱孩看家，時有一爲中區警局廚予所收義之九歲大女孩來玩，老錢乃囑伊代抱此一歲零五個月之女嬰片刻，以便提水洗物，詎該大女孩即抱此嬰孩，乘間由後門向鐵道方面逃走。時在正午，鄭夫人甫由外回家，査知此事，偵騎四出，均無消息，下落不明。約一時許，鄭氏聞訊趕圓，洽由中區李局長德洋，一面分電各警所找尋，一面電吿總廳督察處轉知城郊下關各局，一體尋找。</p>
<p>其後，總廳蘆任官，前鄕州警察局長孫思益及東郊警察局李科長謙仁等皆到來，硏究査尋之技衛，結果決定採用鳴鑼傳知之古老辦法，洽由中區辦理，鄭氏及其家人，並馳赴各處尋找，歷數小時，均未發現，而在偵査方面，雖經相當努力，亦無綫索，時已六時許。</p>
<p>先是，鄭氏於一週前，已病故一年南一歲之男公子，今復遭此意外，實令人無法忍受。其夫人正在萬分焦念之際，忽得佳音，龍王廟警察所官二楊曙睛關操喜，偕同地保二人抱一嬰孩，口中嚷道：「鄭先生的一歲多小女孩，已找回來了。」鄭氏及其夫人等聞訊，忙走過去接抱小嬰孩，該孩笑顏可愛，在塲衆人，皆大歡喜。據　官楊曙晴云：九歲大女孩，先將一歲多之小嬰孩拋棄鍼道旁，即逃走，被批棄之嬰孩當時大哭，旋爲過路之人周致和（四十一歲，淮安人，住五福巷十一號）等人所收留，嗣同院之人聞得警察所鳴鑼通知，始由傳文斌（二十一歲，淮安人）前來報信云。旋由鄭氏對市民地保等，分別給予實金。</p>
<p>事後，鄭氏語人云：廚夫所收獲之九歲女，心術如此惡劣，應受感化敎育，以免將來社會蒙受其害。小女嬰之失而復得，應歸功於一部份官警特別熱心與鳴鑼收效甚大所致。是日下午，鳴鑼後，不及二小時，就找到孩子，其效不亞於外國廣播。我無收音機，對一般民衆，自以鳴鑼爲宜，尤以尋人爲有效，切勿視爲落伍。此外，市民與警察之熟心如何，亦極有關。</p>
<h3>罷了兩天市　決定了緊急對策</h3>
<p>風潮繼續了二天，罷市也似是而非的半關了二天店門，把溫州城區的米店米廠打得落花流水，才算把人們的氣平了下去。</p>
<p>第八區行政督察專員公署張實琛專員當即召集永嘉各界首長，舉行緊急會議，商討緊急對策，決定六項辦法：</p>
<p>（一）規定廿一日起，永嘉次白米每千元十二市斤，米商向鄉區購穀價格爲每百斤五千六百元，如大戶囤積不糶，可報請縣府格辦，幷將其存糧以軍糧收購價格强制收購。</p>
<p>（二）向田糧處借殼一萬擔，（現存永嘉者）發交糧食同業公會，以規定價格配發應市，幷即日電滬購抵足額歸還。如有差額，由縣商會及縣參議會負責籌補</p>
<p>（三）由警察局派警通知各被毁米廠，漏夜修理機件，即日復工，幷派兵保護。</p>
<p>（四）鼓勵檢舉鄕區大戶囤積居奇，對檢舉人從優給獎。</p>
<p>（五）各米商米店售米，如超過規定價格，或有浸水摻雜等情事，一經査覺，嚴懲不貸。</p>
<p>（六）組織民食調劑委員會，即日開始民食調劑工作。</p>
<p>風潮平息後，每千元十二市斤的平價米，也應過幾天市面，不過因爲糧源。資金等，在在發生困難，不久便是維持在斷斷續續的情况之下。</p>
<p>過後，自從第八區行政督察專員公署公佈糧食限價每千元十二市斤後，鄕下餘糧運入城區者，即日見减少，而且近乎絕跡，而平價米必須帶着戶籍牌去，擠上一整天也不一定買得五百元。唯一辦法還是只有找黑市，但是黑市又因爲限價的法令限制着，食戶購米發生極大的困難，紛紛向專署請求取銷限價命令，於是張寳琛專員在本月五日召開永嘉縣民食調劑委員會，會議決定：爲了暢通糧源，穩定糧價，不得已，自三月七日起，取銷糧食限價。</p>
<p>最近米價因此又躍上一級，每千元僅有六斤了，人們還是忍受在糧價的高壓下，度着半飢饉狀態的悲慘日子。</p>
<h3>患着貧血症　又陷入失業狀態</h3>
<p>整個社會經濟，經過八年戰爭的煎熬，顯露了貧血現象，由於種種複雜的緣故，在溫州除去少數有錢有勢者外，一般中下階層的人，遇到一個同一的感覺，便是「吃飯難」。能够每天三餐適意地吃個飽，可眞有些不容易！</p>
<p>據此間社會人士估計，勝利以來，溫州經常有近萬人在失業狀態中過日子。在溫州要謀一個「飯碗」，比在上海杭州一帶不見得不困難。過去在戰爭期中，而被人所不齒的小學敎員，目前在溫州，却爲了這吃不飽餓不死的每月數千元代價而被一般所謂智識份子的失業者搶着敎呢！最近縣政府，招考鄕鎭公所戶籍幹事，據聞有數百人前去投考。不久以前，中央電影院招考女招待，也被一班曾受過相當敎育的「蜜斯」們在那裏『競考』呢！</p>
<p>再看：過去被「文士」們所羨慕的勞工，如人力車夫，船夫等，早已失去他們所說的可觀收入了，如今一個車夫，奔跑着過一整天牛馬生活，除去付車租的錢外竟會不够買二三斤米的。只要你走過碼頭，便會有許多車夫船夫上來挽攬生意，這就可想見他們的生活鬥爭之緊張。</p>
<p>各機關都在實行裁員，因此，大批無依靠的小公務員，被排擠了出來，「差事」一時謀不到，弄得走頭無路。</p>
<p>溫州，這個擁有十四萬人口的濱海都市，但願它能早日脫離生活上的陰影，投向溫暖的春陽！</p>

<h3>救救山東</h3>
<p>— 魯民</p>
<p>八年抗戰，對外抵禦外侮，以求國際之自由平等，對內和平統一，以達國家之富强康樂，舉國上下誓死以赴者以此，茹苦含辛，應久不渝者亦以此。終以公理戰勝強權，正養擊敗侵略，喜訊傳來，舉國歡騰。此正吾民休養生息，致力建設，千載一時之機。詎外侮方平，內亂又興，舉國騷然，吾魯尤甚。中共八年來假抗日之名，行割據之實，所蘊蓄之力量，對國家則破壞其統一·使分崩而離析，對人民則破壞其倫常，戕賊其道德，掠奪其資產，危害其生命，假「民主」之名，而行割據之實，以異端邪說曲解民意，以裏脅威迫强奸民意，虐政暴行，罄竹難書。茲舉其犖犖大者略陳如后：</p>
<p>「掛羊頭賣狗肉之主義」。—中共一貫作風，即是口是心非，狡獪欺騙，使局外熱血人士墮入彀中，近更變本加厲，到處製造階級對立，極盡挑撥離間之能事。甚至硬使夫妻反目，骨肉相殘，並利用大批無惡不作之地痞流氓，以莫須有或無中生有之理由，發動</p>
<p>「普遍而慘烈無比之鬥爭」，—雖中下人家亦所不免。被鬥爭者，無論男女，除剝衣侮辱及傾家蕩產外，必以拉洋樓，活埋，暗殺，酷刑等方法，置之死地而後快。所謂</p>
<p>「拉洋樓」，—不可就文義解釋，此乃泰始事酷刑「五馬分屍」之變相。凡被鬥爭者或不服從其愚弄者，均以長繩拴於馬後，打馬奔馳，直至血肉糢糊，白骨盡露，拖死爲止。區內婦女有不服共破壞廉恥之演劇跳舞，扭秧歌（與跳草裙舞同，口內並須哼唱淫蕩小　）等命令看，即將其　光，赤身條條，二人牽足　行地上，面部碎襲，乳盤擦去，慘不忍覩，至死方休，並棄屍　野，任犬呑齧，以儆來者·一月之間，被拉之「洋樓」以萬一計。最近並定</p>
<p>「三月計劃」，—於三個月內全部門光殺光，是以直接間接，因此喪生者不知凡幾。其餘人民，凡在十八歲以上五十歲以下者，均被</p>
<p>「强徵民兵」。—如有違抗逃避，立即處死或嚴懲其家屬，更設連坐之法以束縛之。每人發給手溜彈四枚，驅赴前方，破壞交通，攻擊國軍。當其偸襲時，則採用慘無人道之</p>
<p>「五撲戰衛」，—即以超過國軍數百倍之民兵作前鋒，分五批進攻，而共軍殿後，以機槍催陣。其目的在以良民大量之生命，消耗國軍有限之彈藥，以百姓當砲灰，以人命作工具，其陰險居心，豺狼成性，有若此者。因此人人自危，爭相逃避，然在其嚴密監視下，逃離共區之難，無法言兪。蓋共黨每到一處，首即</p>
<p>「封鎖交通」。—强迫村民値崗査詢行人，鄰村往還，如無閶長，村長，團長，救國會長等連環蓋章之通行證，即寸步難行，收復區槪在封鎖之列，不得前往，倘有故違，即行活埋。其言論自由政策之實行，即二人相見不敢偶語，否則一經偵知，即加以</p>
<p>「思想頑固，反動派，或國特」—之名，其不危及生命者幾希。各中小都市之無綫電收音機，於共軍佔領該地後二日內，悉數沒收，以貫澈其「自由」之口號。强勒捐款徵槍枝之事，已無足爲奇。而在間睡眠禁止閉戶，共黨得隨意出入，</p>
<p>「財物貞操，一任盜事。」—白日則假開會之名，强迫靑年婦女參與，以饜其調戲汚辱之慾。婦女翁父如阻其前往，則必强使其「父女翁媳跳舞」—以侮辱之。是以無人不亟盼政府之拯救，若大旱之望雲霓。此念設爲偵悉，則放重刑拷問。酷刑摧殘後，疊桌十餘，使跪頂端，然後將桌推倒，落地跌斃，而名之曰</p>
<p>「望朮慶」。—知識份子之不甘爲利用者，視作肉中刺，眼中釘，非慘遭暗殺，即夜間失踪。烟台學生近日因不滿共黨汚辱婦女行為提出質問，當即有十餘人被殺，當夜失踪者五十餘人。民間藏書，均被迫呈報，除新民主主義論，聯合政府，唯物論辯證法，或其他共產書籍外，悉數收去焚毁，以竟秦始皇</p>
<p>「焚書坑儒」—未竟之大業。聯合國善後救濟總署之救濟物資麵粉等數十萬包，月前運往華北，但人民粒粉未見，悉充共軍給養，反增其攻擎國軍，破壞交通，擾亂地方，殘害百姓之力量。近日陸續冒死逃出者，爲數甚夥。共黨有見及此，復施毒辣手段，在外男子，無論最近逃出或原係在外，均迫其家屬於五月底前召回，否則除家產沒收外，其家中五十歲以下十六歲以上之婦女，全數</p>
<p>「強制配與匪徒，供洩獸慾」。—種種暴行，筆難罄書，其假面具後之擰猙面目，慘絕人寰之毒辣手段，非身臨其境者所能想像。山東人民，處此厄境，如水益深，如火益熱。若不迅予拯救，則我魯民無噍類矣！蘇聯在東北工業區的活動引起中國人民之疑懼　本報資料室特繪</p>

<h3>平劇的前途</h3>
<p>— 時潤</p>
<p>我對平劇　是外行，却很感興趣，每月　要去看幾　。</p>
<p>我覺得平劇的保守性太重了，它根本沒有進步，沒有改革，現在京朝角兒們的拿手好戲，和譚呌天做內庭供奉時代的有沒有兩樣？去今已四五十年了，你們找出它絲毫進步的跡象嗎？</p>
<p>時代的巨輪是前進的，日新　　的，昨日的事，就是陳舊的歷史了，你不跟時代跑，便落在時代之後。現在的平劇便已是落在時代之後遠多了，再不爬起來直迫，便會和崑曲一樣，人們不再理會你了。幸而平劇和時代間的距離還望得見，要追上還來得及。</p>
<p>歐陽予倩先生該是平劇界的先知先覺吧！只是他努力了一陣，竟慘遭滑鐵盧。我希望他深自檢討，檢討失敗的根源在什麽地方。去其精華，存其槽粕，坐在戲館的冷板凳上看炒冷飯的玩意兒，誰也要感到屁股痛的。我祝歐陽先生捲土重來，替平劇建立和電影話劇般的磐石基礎。</p>
<p>平劇的優點在什麽地方呢，這是改良平劇的先生們所要注意的。我覺得平劇至今所以能在藝壇和電影括劇鼎足而三的唯一特點，在它唱詞，動作，音樂，化　的圖案化，這是深合美術原則的。我們看到電影話劇中唸白與舉動，一投手，一言語，一動一態，一情一咳都力求其現實，力求自然，但表演出來的成績，常常不到好處，反而呆板火自然太機械，總不能像在所演的環境之下，據像做作，令觀衆感到肉麻，感到過火，感得他在裝得像而不像，它不能浸觀衆在戲裏，這是電影話劇的缺點（尤其是話劇），至於電影話劇能有普遍的觀衆，那是別有原因的。平劇就看得透這一點，戲終是戲，與其看得使觀衆覺得不現實，不逼眞，索性使它合乎一定的節奏，就是圖案化，而致力於眞正藝術的表現，因此獨有平劇能克服上述的困難，就能把觀衆浸在戲裏，因爲藝術是價美，唯有藝術的美才能予觀衆以愉快以調劑，而合乎娛樂的本旨。所以平劇的觀衆，國笙歌之聲，都會不覺脫口而出的哼兩句。戲迷吃花酒時會哼着「孤王酒醉桃花宮」，答話會用「正是」。至於粉墨登塲的票友們，則直浴於戲中矣。</p>
<p>這樣圖案化的結果，使伶人們的演技，都很精湛老練，他們幾　看家戲，的確能使人回味無窮，平劇的美就美在這裏。現在海上的幾個自命改良平劇家，把這些特點都棄若敝屣：臉譜也沒有了，身段也不講究了，伴奏的絲竹　鈸也只賸下面小羅，不謂平劇經他們所謂進步的結果，僅是摸了些話劇的渣滓，加點機關佈景，劍俠神仙和江湖賣藝流的出手開打，犧牲色相的肉感　舞，用來吸引觀衆，出賣噱頭，撈點鈔票，說它是京戲賞賺上已不是京戲了，而是極幼稚　脚，迎合賬夫走卒兒意們低級胃口的類乎文明戲。</p>
<p>平劇的觀衆們也不覺得它的至美了，要看些老奸巨滑淋漓盡致的盡操蔣幹之類。還是返問老戲衷求，雖然老　是沒有進步沒有改良的。</p>
<p>我願平劇界高　遠矚的諸先生們，認淸平劇詩華及糟粕之所在，下最大的決心來改良平劇，取「國劇」這個美冕而冠之。</p>
<h3>影劇小聞</h3>
<p>費曾赴故鄕蘇州寫劇本，返滬後積極籌備開拍，費氏係本市參議員之一，因忙於籌備拍戲工作，本屆參議會未能出席，日前費氏又赴蘇州，除爲途其太夫人　　返鄕外，並將在蘇攝襲外景。</p>
<p>吳永剛之「忠勇之家」已籌備就緒，日來趕製預算，籌辦服裝導具，中電二廠人員，頗形忙碌，第一堂佈景，亦已開始搭製。該劇將由薜伯靑攝影，談鶴鳴錄音，秦怡劉瓊主演。佈景則由中常劇團之李恩杰設計。</p>
<p>上海戲劇電影聯營公司係史東沙，紀宗德等所發起，在重慶時曾印有計劃書一厚册，刻正分頭集資招股云。</p>
<p>中電劇團來滬後之第二節目，重慶二十四小時，已在蘭心上演，該劇係沈浮得意之作，噱頭頗多，在渝上演，甚爲賣座，惜在滬觀衆，並不踴躍，推其原因，或由該劇中之噓頭，多係重慶噱頭，如「掛球」，「　防空洞」「下江人」，「續神堡壘」等名詞及其含義，恐並非上海人士所能領會者。</p>
<p>美國五彩片到了上　，不僅上海話劇打破了可怕的例紀錄，即抗戰期間美國攝製的幾部有意義的文藝戲劇影片如「萊因河守衛」「花衣吹笛人」「阿丹諾之鐘」等亦生意悽慘。</p>
<p>吳永剛寫作「忠勇之家」時會多方搜集淪陷時之上海生活資料，　頭甚多，該片完全後，必能予上海人士以高度之現實感。</p>
<p>陳　庭將個吳永剛忠勇之家後，爲中電二廠拍戲，劇本初稿已完成，暫名「遙遠的愛」。將由名演員趙丹主演。</p>
<p>趙丹亦將導演一戲，趙氏爲愼重起見，曾數易劇本，廣搜資料，刻正埋頭創作中。</p>
<p>中電第二廠（北平）新聞片工作頗爲緊張，頃又運到七本到滬，有中美合作之美軍在北平，及東北接收情形等。</p>

<h3>忠勇之家</h3>
<p>— 瑯環</p>
<p>「梅尼弗太太」原是一部美國好銷小說，出版後曾轟動一時，讀者對它的愛好，歷久不衰。</p>
<p>故事是叙第二次大戰爆發時，英國一個中等人家的一些悲歡離合，日常瑣事。梅尼弗先生從事建築業，同他太太住在倫敦近郊的貝爾亨村中，不多的收入，適供他們度着稍帶「奢侈」的安樂生活，生活是那般寗靜，幽閒。</p>
<p>梅尼弗太太因買帽子而遇到站長白勒德，因白勒德要用她名字題花，參加花卉比賽，而招引來了倍爾登小姐。梅尼弗的大兒子魏恩和倍爾登小姐發生了愛戀，而此時突然傳來英德宣戰的消息，全村頓入戰時狀態。此後接着是魏恩投軍，是梅尼弗先生駕着汽艇，去援救自鄧扣克撤退的英軍，在這些怱遽紛擾中，再穿揷着魏恩和倍爾登的結婚，盛大的花卉比賽，花卉比賽才完畢，警報突發，新婚的倍爾登小姐，竟不幸在空襲中遇難。</p>
<p>全　叙的是一些瑣碎的事情，描繪的是一些平凡的人物，但全書的好處就是在事情瑣碎，而錢跡淸楚，亳不紊亂；人物平凡，而個性刻　，充滿了人生的趣味。我很歡喜「梅尼弗太太」一書，覺得繼奧斯登和高爾斯華綏之後，純用安閒的筆調，揀日常的瑣事，描繪出英國中等人家那種沈晦的個性，豐富的幽默感，以及對生活的欣賞，人情的試探等，寫得好的很少，這書的確是一部很成功的作品。所不同的，就是「梅尼弗太太」一書的背景，取材於最近的戰事，這使一班讀者感到更親切有趣，同時戰事更能將英國人民那種堅靱的個性，顯明的映托出來。</p>
<p>這部値得推蘆的小說，由米高梅影片公司攝成影片，由威廉衛勒導演，葛麗亞珈遜和華德畢金主演。現在大華戲院放演，影片改名爲「忠義之家」。</p>
<p>我看過這影片後，覺得很滿意。不過我覺得這張片子的成功，固然要歸功於葛麗亞珈遜，但導演選擇主角之稱合，實在是不容　沒的一件事。以葛麗亞珈遜那種沈閒的個性，飾梅尼弗太太一角，實在再適合沒有。華德畢金的演技很穩練，即使一些小的動作，都不肯隨便放過，苔莎萊持的倍爾登小姐，李査雷的魏恩，亨利崔物斯的站長，在爭執，跳舞，得獎數幕中，表演得都很値得讚許。</p>
<p>文藝的影片，是很不容易討好的，這一半固然由於一部作品攝成影片後，經過删節摘取，往往失去原有的調協約美處，一半也是因爲在文藝影片中，即使主角演技精湛，獲得成功，若是配角等偶一不能握住劇情，往往會破壞原作的風格。記得葛麗亞珈遜在『雀開辟選』一片中（奧斯登的『驕傲與偏見』），演技相當成功，但飾彭納太太和飾科林斯先生的，表演得太過火，遂使奧斯登的中等英國人家，染上了美國小店婦女的氣息，原作的風格完全喪失了。固然，一張文　影片，不能太拘泥於原來的作品，但在一張影片中，民族的個性與時代社會背景，若是矛盾不融洽地方太多，總是不大好的。我想這也許是因爲時代的關係，演員在模擬方面要感到困難些。而『忠勇之家』一片，因爲演員們都分配得勻　，使原作的精神都能保持，這一點是值得爲原作感到快慰的。</p>

<h3>Soviet Troops Withdraw from Northeast in Batches; All to Return Home Before Month's End; Malinovsky Departs Changchun</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 6th Dispatch] Official News: The takeover of Northeast China by the National Army is progressing well on all fronts, now reaching Changtu in the north and Benxi in the south. Liang Huasheng is currently directing operations in Kaiyuan, and the Beining Railway is extremely congested with troop trains every day. Zheng Dongguo, acting commander of the Northeast Security Command, arrived in Panyang on the 6th.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 6th Dispatch] It is rumored that the Soviet troops in Changchun will complete their withdrawal by the 15th. If the Northeast Executive Headquarters cannot take effective steps before the 15th, Changchun will soon become a battlefield. It is said that Communist troops are gathering in the four suburbs of Changchun, and it is rumored that Jiutai has been captured, while Nong'an is also under siege by Communist troops.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Changchun, 6th Dispatch] Marshal Malinovsky left for Harbin by car at 11:40 AM on the 6th to return to his country. Dong Yanping, head of our military delegation, led all the members of the delegation to the station to see him off. Zhang Peizhe and Yang Zuoren, members of the delegation, accompanied Marshal Malinovsky to Harbin.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] Before leaving Changchun this afternoon, Marshal Malinovsky had a cordial conversation with Dong Yanping, the head of our military delegation, at the station for forty minutes. Marshal Malinovsky stated that he would stay in Harbin for a week and would maintain contact with our military delegation until the last Soviet troops withdrew from the north. It is reported that Marshal Malinovsky repeatedly emphasized the importance and inevitability of friendly relations between China and the Soviet Union today.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Harbin, 6th Dispatch] Marshal Malinovsky and Troshenko, along with their headquarters staff, arrived in Harbin at 5:40 PM on the 6th.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Jinzhou, 5th Dispatch] The Soviet troops in Northeast China have officially announced the withdrawal date, and all troops will be withdrawn to the Soviet Union by April 30th. During the meeting between Lieutenant General Dong Yanping and Lieutenant General Troshenko on the 3rd of this month, Lieutenant General Troshenko was ordered to announce the withdrawal date of the Soviet troops: (1) All staff members of Marshal Malinovsky's headquarters will leave Changchun for their country on April 5th. The Soviet troops in Changchun will complete their withdrawal on the 14th and 15th. The commander of the Karlov city defense will be the last to leave Changchun, and the epidemic prevention outposts in the suburbs will be withdrawn on the 10th. (2) The Soviet troops in Harbin will complete their withdrawal on the 25th. (3) The withdrawal from Jilin City will be completed from the 3rd to the 16th. (4) Qiqihar will be evacuated on the 26th or 27th. (5) Mudanjiang will be evacuated on the 26th or 29th. (6) The areas north of Bei'an, Jiamusi, and Boli can also be evacuated before the 10th. According to the above plan, all Soviet troops can be withdrawn to the Soviet Union before April 30th.</p>
<p>[United Press, Shenyang, 6th Dispatch] Authoritative sources have learned that the New First Army, equipped with American weaponry, is expanding its advance towards Sipingjie. Meanwhile, it is learned here that the Soviet troops plan to completely withdraw from Changchun before April 14th. The Communist troops have attempted to contain the advance of the National Army in Sipingjie and have increased their forces in the Changchun area, apparently aiming to occupy Changchun when the Soviet troops complete their withdrawal. This action has hindered the advance of the main force of the New First Army and prevented them from reaching Changchun. However, a large number of National Army troops have crossed the railway blockade line in Sipingjie, mostly on foot, with some traveling by car, attempting to reach the city before the Communist troops can overcome the local garrison troops. According to recent estimates, there are 7,000 National Army troops in Changchun, including 1,000 troops airlifted from the Beiping area several months ago, 3,000 local militia members, and 3,000 policemen.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Seoul, 5th Dispatch, United Press] According to visitors from North Korea, approximately 50,000 Soviet troops have entered the Soviet-occupied zone of Korea from Northeast China. The total number of Soviet troops in North Korea is currently 106,000. There is frequent movement of Soviet troops between Pyongyang and the 38th parallel, with approximately 40,000 Soviet troops in that area.</p>
<p>Changchun is Surrounded on All Sides; Security Forces in the City Strengthen Defense Work</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Changchun, 6th Dispatch] Changchun is now surrounded on all sides by Communist troops, with the closest vanguard only eight kilometers away from Changchun. In addition, Communist troops are stationed in Kaoshantun, 12 kilometers west of the city, Quantoutai, 15 kilometers southeast of the city, and Xiangshuiquan, 12.5 kilometers away, while the area north of the city has become a place where Communist troops from Dehui frequently appear. The number of those lurking in the city is still inestimable, and the defensive work built by the city security forces is being actively expanded and strengthened.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] The number of Communist troops around Changchun is still increasing. From the 4th to the 5th, an additional 26,000 troops were added in Buhai and Halaha, north of Changchun, reportedly transported south by train from areas such as Biancheng near Harbin. On the 4th, the Communist troops also disarmed the railway protection team in Buhai.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 6th Dispatch] The cities of Lindian and Fuyu, belonging to Nenjiang Province, have been captured by Communist troops. Furthermore, Qiqihar, where the provincial government is located, is now in a state of encirclement.</p>
<p>[United Press, Chongqing, 6th Dispatch] Observers here are closely monitoring the development of the situation in Northeast China in the next ten days, believing that this matter has a significant impact on the situation in the coming years. The Soviet troops are preparing to withdraw completely by the end of April and have notified the Chinese authorities of their withdrawal steps. The content of the notification has not yet been disclosed. This notification may allow the National Army to take over important cities in Northeast China before the Communist troops arrive. If the Soviet troops fail to hand over the main cities to the National Army, relations between China and the Soviet Union may become strained. Whether the Executive Headquarters will go to Northeast China to work, whether the civil war will break out, or whether it will be resolved by means of settling disputes can also be largely decided in the next ten days.</p>
<h3>Zhenjiang Establishes Police Academy</h3>
<p>Students are surplus officers</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Zhenjiang, 6th Dispatch] The military and communications departments plan to establish a national police academy in Zhenjiang to train highway, railway, and waterway security personnel. Recently, the Inspection Department of the Military Affairs Commission sent personnel to decide on using Jinshan Temple or the former enemy-puppet alcohol factory as the school site. The first group of students will be approximately 3,000 to 5,000, all surplus officers.</p>
<h3>Military Trio Discuss; No Agreement Yet Reached</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 6th Dispatch] The military trio from Chongqing has not yet arrived on the 6th, indicating that a detailed plan to resolve the Northeast issue has not yet been agreed upon. However, the Northeast Executive Headquarters may depart before the trio arrives, as General Beedle of the United States is urging this matter urgently and wishes to see peace achieved in the Northeast as soon as possible. Furthermore, after the trio arrives in Shenyang, the Shenyang Central Group may be renamed the Northeast Branch of the Mediation Executive Department.</p>
<p>[United Press, Chongqing, 6th Dispatch] The military trio, consisting of representatives from the government, the Communist Party, and the United States, had intended to travel to the Northeast, but has not yet done so. There are two reasons for this: (1) The committee has not reached a consensus on the basic opinions on how to handle the Northeast issue. (2) Chen Cheng, the government representative, is currently suffering from severe stomach illness. Reliable sources say: The government may send another representative. The committee should hold a meeting first to reach an agreement on the disputed points between the two sides, otherwise, it would be meaningless for the three representatives to go to the Northeast.</p>
<p>[United Press, Shenyang, 5th Dispatch] The main purpose of Brigadier General Beedle's flight to Northeast China today is to obtain some guarantees from the Communist Party to satisfy the hopes of the government. The government's opinion seems to be that there is no real Communist military activity in the Northeast, only "guerrillas and bandits."</p>
<h3>Soviet Administrative Officials Refuse to Withdraw from Fushun</h3>
<p>Furniture in Changchun Emptied</p>
<p>[United Press, Fushun, 6th Dispatch] Twenty-three Soviet administrative officials are still "entrenched" behind wire mesh fortifications in the best buildings in Fushun City today. In a note sent to General Zhao Gongwu, commander of the 52nd Army, the Soviet officials firmly asserted that under the Yalta Agreement, the entire Fushun coal mining area, including two underground mines and two of the world's most productive open-pit mines, should belong to the Changchun Railway Company. The Changchun Railway was originally a joint Chinese-Soviet venture but is now managed solely by the Soviet Union. The twenty-three Soviet officials are all wearing Changchun Railway uniforms. When the Chinese authorities request their withdrawal, they consistently reply with firm words: "We are unwilling to withdraw until we receive an order from Stalin to withdraw."</p>
<p>[United Press, Fushun, 6th Dispatch] The Soviet Union has turned Fushun coal mining city into a "second Shenyang." Important machinery and equipment in its coal mines and power plants have been dismantled, causing this industrial hub in southern Dong Provinces to fall silent. Since the mines were occupied by Soviet troops, the daily output of bituminous coal has decreased from 10,000 tons to 1,000 tons.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Changchun, 5th Dispatch] It is generally expected that once the situation stabilizes, the business of furniture merchants, especially wood merchants, will be very prosperous, and the prices of various woodenware and lumber will also be high. Furniture, doors and windows in various fire buildings in the city have been emptied. Tables, chairs, beds, sofas, carpets, wardrobes, screens, and even coat racks and coffee tables are piled up like mountains at the station every day. Train transportation is very frequent, and fully loaded ten-wheeled trucks are still continuously transporting them to the station.</p>
<h3>Embezzlement and Sale of Relief Supplies; Criminals Apprehended in Hankou</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Hankou, 5th Dispatch] The 7th Precinct of the Hankou Police Bureau recently uncovered a case of embezzlement and sale of relief supplies, arresting criminals and seizing items such as flour and canned goods. All are being interrogated by the bureau. It is reported that the place of seizure was at the unloading point of the supplies.</p>
<h3>Conflicts in Hubei Province Have Ceased; The National-Communist Problem in Guangdong Province Has Also Been Resolved; National Army in Chaharbei Break Through Encirclement and Retreat</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Hankou, 6th Dispatch] The Wuhan Executive Headquarters went to Anlu Shemukou at the beginning of the month to mediate the conflict event and returned to Hankou the day before yesterday. According to the American representative of the group, Bai Lishi, the conflict has now stopped, but the issue of responsibility still needs to be further negotiated.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 5th Dispatch] Major General Bu Yasheng, head of the government group of the Zhangjiakou Executive Headquarters, came to Beiping for instructions. It is said that the main difficulty there is that the Communist troops do not recognize the National Army guerrillas within the territory of Zhangjiakou County.</p>
<p>[United Press, Guangzhou, 6th Dispatch] According to a certain newspaper here, the American representative of the Executive Headquarters declared last night that the National-Communist problem in Guangdong Province has been resolved, and the Hainan Island issue is currently being discussed in Chongqing.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Beiping, 6th Dispatch] Military intelligence indicates that the Communist troops in Chaharbei gathered two regiments of troops from Wanquan Yong'an and launched an attack at 7 PM on March 29th on the Nationalist Army's 3rd Company of Zhang Tiancong's department, which was located in the Tai Ma Lin Dahugou area northwest of Wanquan. The department eventually broke through the encirclement and retreated on the morning of the 30th due to being outnumbered, with heavy casualties.</p>
<h3>Temporary Agreement Established for the Repair of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 5th Dispatch] Chen Luhua and others from the Railway Management Section of the Executive Headquarters, along with three section chiefs, established a temporary agreement for the repair of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway with the local government and the Communist Party during their return journey from Jinan, namely (1) South of Da Wenkou, the Communist Party allows repair work to begin southwards, with the exception of isolating the Honggou and Dongbeibao stations. (2) The northern section of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway can be repaired northwards from Yancheng. Repair work has now begun on these two sections.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Jinan, 5th Dispatch] The details of the railway repair work in various sections of Shandong Province since its commencement are recorded as follows: Repair work south of Tai'an, from March 7th to March 29th, restored a length of 20 kilometers and 170 meters. Repair work north of Yancheng, from March 23rd to March 31st, restored a length of 23 kilometers and 180 meters. Repair work east of Zhangdian, from March 8th to March 23rd, restored a length of 21 kilometers and 630 meters. Other sections such as north of Yanzhou, south of Dezhou, west of Tanjiafang, east of Xiawantun, and west of Caijiazhuang have not yet started work.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Jinan, 5th Dispatch] The repatriation of Japanese residents in Jinan was fully completed last week. However, among the technical personnel approved by the government to continue residing here, non-technical personnel who used their background relationships to remain under the guise of technicality to protect their private property account for two-thirds of the number. The general public expresses deep dissatisfaction with this and is working hard to urge the government to pay attention.</p>
<h3>Wedemeyer Passes Through Hawaii; Discusses the China Problem with Reporters; Flies to San Francisco Last Night</h3>
<p>[United Press, Ford Shafter, Hawaii, 6th Dispatch] General Wedemeyer, the commander of U.S. forces in the China theater, passed through here on his return to the United States from Chongqing and is scheduled to fly to San Francisco on the evening of the 6th. Before his departure, he told reporters that China's most pressing problem is the merger of the Communist and Central armies. If the Chinese Communist Party still possesses an army, there is no hope for lasting peace and democracy. The situation in China currently seems to be improving, and it is hoped that this good situation can be maintained. Special Envoy Marshall has done his best in China. It is said that the current conflicts in China are all local conflicts and are not large in scale. If Marshall can persuade both the Nationalists and the Communists to abandon the use of force and resolve various issues through conferences, without infringing upon each other for months or even years, then there is still hope for lasting peace, otherwise, war will inevitably break out again, plunging China back into chaos. China has promulgated some laws in view of the abolition of various foreign privileges in China, causing dissatisfaction among American businessmen. American businessmen presented a memorandum to President Chiang, expressing dissatisfaction with the unequal treatment of Chinese and Western businessmen in Shanghai. This situation has now been corrected. I think President Chiang would not allow any discrimination against foreign businessmen because China currently needs foreign aid.</p>
<h3>Gejiu Tin Merchants Petition; Request Opening of Controls</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Kunming, 5th Dispatch] Gejiu tin merchants, from the largest tin mine-producing area in our country, sent representatives Su Xinong and Liu Guoguang to Kunming yesterday to petition the Yunnan Provincial Government, requesting it to transfer the request to the central government to open tin mine controls, increase tin prices, so that the tin merchants can freely develop, so as to restore production as soon as possible.</p>
<h3>Undelimited Border between Yunnan and Burma at Kawasan; Burmese Troops Invade on Multiple Routes; Take the Opportunity to Kill Overseas Chinese and Loot Property</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Kunming, 5th Dispatch] According to the Kunming Citizen's Daily News on the 4th, Kawasan, in the undelimited border between Yunnan and Burma, originally belonged to our country, but was occupied by the British in the 21st year of the Republic of China. When the Japanese army invaded Burma, the British retreated, and the headquarters of our Expeditionary Force considered the area an important border defense area, so it established the Kawasan Garrison Headquarters. Luo Zhengming, the leader of the branch team, led more than a thousand troops and drove the Japanese army back after several bloody battles. Last year, the department was ordered to be abolished and reorganized into the Southern District People's Self-Defense Branch Team. After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, the branch team was again ordered to withdraw and disband, and the nearby Burmese army took the opportunity to kill thirteen of our merchants, including Liao Kailiang, and loot property worth approximately 30 million national currency. Later, they cruelly killed the overseas Chinese leader Lin Guochu and his son in Zhongnong. They also want to use terrorist means to scare away the Han Chinese in Changdi. Recently, several hundred Burmese troops opened the Kawasan, using foreign missionaries Yong Hengle to threaten and entice about a thousand Kawa people in Banyang Jinzhong and other areas, armed them, and used the chieftain of Xisuoka as a guide, attacking our Nankang Wuxin and other places on multiple routes. After several days of fierce fighting, our self-defense team retreated to Yunsi to concentrate and wait for support due to the disparity in numbers. In this battle, more than fifty enemies were killed.</p>
<h3>Yining Representatives Visit Zhang Zhizhong; Discuss Troop Reorganization Issues; List of Participants in the Provincial Government Has Not Yet Been Submitted</h3>

Zhang gave an explanation of the reduction of the National Army at the military reorganization meeting and promised to provide them with the National Army organizational chart for reference. The list of personnel from Yining participating in the provincial government has not been submitted today, and there is no intention to submit it first, as it seems necessary to wait until the personnel finalized by the central government are understood before formally submitting it. The discussions lasted for two and a half hours and were conducted in a harmonious atmosphere.</p>
<h3>Air Force 5th Group Flies for Performance in Beijing-Shanghai Area</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 6th Dispatch] In order to promote the importance of building an air force among the people in the Beijing-Shanghai area, the Air Force 5th Group decided to conduct regular large-formation flights in the Beijing-Shanghai area.

The court was originally the Dacheng Hall, which can accommodate two thousand people. With a solemn and simple layout, it will be more than enough to show the majesty of the court for trying traitors. It is heard that the High Court has now started work, but due to the absence of personnel from the Procuratorate, cases of traitors and civil and criminal cases have not yet been accepted.

<h3>U.S. Proposes Foreign Ministers Conference: Byrnes Invites Britain, the Soviet Union, and France to Participate; Scheduled to be Held in Paris on the 25th</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] London, 6th Broadcast: U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes has suggested holding a meeting of the foreign ministers of the four major powers. Britain has expressed its approval, but the Soviet Union and France have not yet replied.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 5th] The State Department announced today: Secretary of State Byrnes yesterday invited Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov, British Foreign Secretary Bevin, and French Foreign Minister Bidault to hold a four-power foreign ministers' meeting in Paris on the 25th of this month in order to complete the peace treaties with Italy, Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary, and Finland as soon as possible. The progress of the four foreign ministers' representatives in London in drafting the peace treaties is slow, which is very worrying, it is said.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Paris, 5th] The French cabinet today reiterated its demand for international co-management of the Ruhr. It is reported that Foreign Minister Bidault had a conflict of opinion with President Gouin on the issue of western Germany. Gouin opposed the dismemberment of Germany. This declaration clearly shows that Bidault has won a victory.</p>

<h3>Soviet Troops Retreating from Iran: Iranian Right Wing Expresses Pessimism About the Soviet-Iranian Agreement; Soviets Do Not Allow British Parliamentarians to Enter Azerbaijan for Inspection</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] London, 6th Broadcast: Iranian right-wing elements are pessimistic about the new Soviet-Iranian agreement. They believe that the agreement has accepted all the Soviet Union's demands, for the following reasons: (1) Although the Soviet Union did not directly exert pressure on Iran, the Red Army's presence on the border was a form of pressure to facilitate the new agreement. (2) Iranian law stipulates that the cession of the Sha-Tan area cannot be negotiated before the Red Army withdraws. (3) Azerbaijan is purely an internal matter and should not be included in the agreement.</p>
<p>[United Press, Tehran, 6th] Amid the tense Soviet-Iranian dispute, the British Parliament sent two members to Iran to observe the actual situation. At present, they have given up trying to enter Azerbaijan because the Soviet side has adopted a consistent approach, not allowing any journalists to enter the province. These two British parliamentarians cannot be an exception, so they will leave Iran on April 10th and return to their country.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Tehran, 5th] Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister Firouz announced today that the direct negotiations between the Soviet Union and Iran in Tehran and Moscow have resolved all outstanding issues on the basis of complete reciprocity and goodwill. First, the Iranian Prime Minister and the Soviet Ambassador have formally signed a joint communiqué, stating that the Soviet troops will unconditionally withdraw from Iran by May 5th, and the Soviet-Iranian oil agreement will be submitted to the Iranian parliament for discussion. This communiqué is clearly a provisional agreement. In addition to announcing it at a press conference, Firouz said that the Iranian cabinet has unanimously approved it, but no formal treaty has been signed.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Tehran, 5th] Dozens of Soviet heavy artillery and tanks have been moving north, crossing the Soviet-Iranian border in Astara today. According to foreign military observers, the Soviet troops are indeed retreating. The Soviet government is clearly able to abide by the agreement. This is not a rehearsal, but the real thing.</p>

<h3>Truman Speech on U.S. Army Day: The Purpose of Diplomatic Policy is to Prevent Aggression; Recognize British and Soviet Interests in the Far East; Britain and the Soviet Union Should Respect U.S. Intentions</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Chicago, 6th] President Truman, in a speech at the Army Day event at the Soldier Field here today, stated that the purpose of U.S. foreign policy is to prevent oppression and aggression against smaller countries, advocating that the U.S. should maintain a strong reserve army in peacetime. The relationship between the U.S. and other countries, no matter how far these countries are from the U.S. mainland, should be based on a universal policy. The U.S. recognizes that Britain and the Soviet Union have "significant interests" in the Far East, and these countries should also respect the U.S.'s intention to achieve peace and security in the Far East. It is hoped that Britain and the Soviet Union can also align with the U.S. in the pursuit of peace. The United Nations organization has the right to insist on the sovereignty and territorial integrity of countries in the Near East and the Middle East and cannot allow them to be threatened by oppression and aggression. In these countries, hostile external forces may conflict. The U.S. hopes that disputes between colonial powers and colonized peoples everywhere can be resolved peacefully. If the Security Council of the United Nations organization truly respects the "legitimate hopes and demands" of member states, then no matter how different the countries are in their ideas, traditions, and interests, there will be "sufficient power" to resolve the disputes that arise between them. The U.S. is willing to unite with other countries in the Americas to conclude alliances and jointly prevent external attacks. The current goal of the U.S. is to fully support the United Nations organization. The U.S. is prepared to establish a world trade system and provide necessary assistance to consolidate and guarantee world peace. Reform and control of Japan is only the first step in U.S. Far East policy. What we hope is to quickly restore the Far East economy and international trade. To achieve this goal, the U.S. is willing to lend and provide technical assistance to various countries. Congress should approve the U.S. loan to Britain. Atomic energy is the "greatest threat" left by this war. We should control atomic energy so that it benefits humanity and does not destroy it.</p>
<h3>Japanese Actually Commit Destructive Acts Against Allied Forces: Tokyo Airport is Sabotaged</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Tokyo, 6th] At Chofu Airfield, 45 miles from Tokyo, the first organized destructive act by the Japanese against Allied forces occurred. All personnel of the U.S. Fifth Air Force at the site have been ordered to maintain a 24-hour armed alert. Japanese rioters infiltrated the airfield in the darkness, destroying valuable transportation and aviation equipment, cutting telephone and telegraph lines, and destroying telegraph machines. Judging from the extent of the damage, it appears to have been done by people with specialized skills, so it is believed that the saboteurs may be Japanese soldiers.</p>

<h3>Jiang Tingfu Issues an Appeal: Please Americans Stop Eating Rice, So That Our Country Can Have Surplus Rice to Alleviate the Disaster; The Food Committee's Allocation of Rice to Our Country is Unfair</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 5th] Jiang Tingfu, Director of the Chinese Executive Yuan's Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, today, through U.S. Acting Secretary of State Acheson, appealed to Americans to stop eating rice so that China can have more surplus rice. It is said that rice is not the usual food of Americans, and a small reduction in consumption here is enough to alleviate the food shortage in China. Jiang also told reporters that the United Food Committee's allocation of rice to China is very unfair. For example, in the first quarter of this year, of the 160,000 tons of rice from Siam (Thailand), China was only allocated 16,000 tons. The relief rice for China from the Food Committee is distributed under the auspices of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration. It is said that 60,000 tons have been shipped to China in the first quarter of this year, and it is expected to increase in the second quarter.</p>

Hoover finally said: The prerequisite for victory is artillery, and the prerequisite for peace is food. The world already has an organization to maintain peace and must have an organization to maintain life. The conference passed a resolution calling on all countries to reduce the grain used to make bread as much as possible, prevent waste, and step up the elimination of rats and insects that damage shells.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] London, 6th Broadcast: Hoover left Britain this afternoon and will visit the Netherlands, Belgium, Denmark, Germany, Austria, Yugoslavia, and Greece, and then go to India.</p>
<p>Weekly Forum</p>
<h3>The Trend of the Anglo-French Alliance and the Future of the Paris Peace Conference</h3>
<p>— Chǔ Yùkūn</p>
<p>The restoration of the Anglo-French alliance has progressed from gestation to a mature stage. First, the French interim president and Prime Minister Gouin delivered a speech, clarifying France's foreign policy, stating, "France must find a way to establish an Anglo-French alliance as a supplement to the Franco-Soviet alliance. If this alliance treaty could further lead to the conclusion of a three-power treaty, that would be even more beneficial." Subsequently, the French Socialist Party held a general assembly, also expressing support for President Gouin's proposal to immediately restore the Anglo-French alliance, and in its message to the French people, it stated: "France should sign a treaty with Britain of the same nature as the Franco-Soviet alliance treaty, in order to enhance political and economic cooperation between the peoples of Britain and France." On the British side, this immediately resonated, welcoming the realization of the Anglo-French alliance. Therefore, Foreign Secretary Bevin also announced in the House of Commons that the British government has always been willing to maintain close relations with France, and believes that Anglo-French relations can be greatly enhanced at the appropriate time by signing a treaty similar in nature to the Franco-Soviet alliance treaty, so this treaty is a guarantee against further aggression." Since Britain and France are so aligned in their thinking, the restoration of the Anglo-French alliance should not be difficult to achieve, it goes without saying. Moreover, there are external reports that Foreign Secretary Bevin will visit France, so everyone speculates that the Anglo-French alliance may be realized as early as within April, or at the latest by the eve of the opening of the Paris Peace Conference on May 1st, the alliance treaty may be signed in Paris.</p>
<p>The Anglo-French alliance was originally a traditional relationship between the two countries. Before the First World War, Britain and France formed the Entente Cordiale on the condition of mutual concessions and mutual compromises; later, during the First World War, they fought side by side, weathering storms together, and finally achieved the final victory. After the end of the war, because the interests of Britain and France failed to converge in many cases, their steps diverged. France attempted to dominate the European continent, while Britain's European policy was based on "balance of power," and they gradually could not cooperate effectively. However, the division between Britain and France only benefited third parties. Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy seized the opportunity to rise, deliberately engaging in aggression, plunging the entire Europe into the threat of war, almost creating a situation where there was a constant state of panic. Later, Britain and France saw the European political situation becoming more and more serious, and they began to bury the hatchet and resume friendly relations, emphasizing the traditional relationship of the Anglo-French alliance, and adopted a common and unified anti-aggression policy. Although it was somewhat late, they were able to declare war on Germany at the same time and in the same way, which was ultimately a wise move. But unfortunately, France staged a major tragedy of the era in the Second World War. As the leader of the European allies, it resisted the German invasion, but collapsed in less than a month, and bowed to Hitler, allowing him to slaughter it! Fortunately, the patriotic General de Gaulle rose up and led the resistance movement, and organized a French government in exile in London. Thanks to the assistance of Britain, and further supported by the United States, its momentum grew, and it finally reversed France's misfortune, and was still one of the five powers after the war.</p>
<p>From this, we can see the close relationship between Britain and France. But why hasn't a formal alliance treaty been signed to this day after this World War? And what is most surprising is that the Franco-Soviet alliance treaty and the Anglo-Soviet friendship treaty have both been established, but only the Anglo-French alliance treaty has not been signed. What is the reason? According to our analysis, Britain and France still hold different views on certain European issues after the war: the most obvious are: (1) The Spanish issue. France believes that the existence of the Franco regime is enough to endanger world peace, so it demands that this issue be submitted to the United Nations Security Council for handling. But Britain only opposes the Franco regime in principle, but does not advocate interfering in Spain's internal affairs, and with the support of the United States, France's wishes cannot be realized for the time being. (2) Regarding the western border issue of Germany, France firmly insists on separating the Ruhr area and the Rhineland from Germany, especially to supply the coal produced in the Ruhr area to France. Former Prime Minister Blum of the Popular Front cabinet went to the United States to visit, and its main purpose was to make the United States and the public support France's proposal. Britain, on the other hand, believes that the disposal of defeated Germany should be discussed and resolved jointly by the Allied powers. (3) The Near East issue is also a place where British and French opinions differ. But recently, Britain and France have both agreed to withdraw their troops from Lebanon and Syria. Britain implemented this first, and France also fulfilled its pledge as scheduled, so there are generally no problems.</p>
<p>Since there are still these issues to be resolved between Britain and France, General de Gaulle insisted that all outstanding issues between the two countries must be resolved before signing the alliance treaty, as the basis for the Anglo-French alliance treaty. But Britain hopes that France will first sign a general treaty, using explicit provisions to specify various goals, so that other issues will be easily resolved. This is where the opinions of Britain and France differ, and it is also the reason why the Anglo-French alliance treaty has been delayed in being signed. However, the international developments in the past month have made both Britain and France feel the need to restore the alliance treaty as soon as possible. From France's point of view, although France has a treaty of friendship and alliance with the Soviet Union, it still feels isolated in Europe, especially feeling great anxiety about how to deal with the resurgence of German aggression. Moreover, from the Nordic countries, all the Baltic Sea coastal countries and the Balkan Peninsula countries are under Soviet control, so the balance between the United States and the Soviet Union has been lost. In any case, France and the Soviet Union can no longer be in an equal position as before the war. Therefore, France very much hopes that the Anglo-French alliance will be realized as soon as possible, so that the Franco-Soviet, Anglo-Soviet, and Anglo-French treaties can be transformed into a three-power treaty, so that France can be secure. On the British side, seeing the excessive expansion of Soviet power on the European continent, and the tacit establishment of an Eastern European bloc, Britain, in order to maintain the balance of power in Europe, has to win over France and conclude an alliance, and then ask the remaining Western European countries such as the Netherlands and Belgium to participate, so that a Western European bloc is formed invisibly, which can compete with the Soviet-led Eastern European bloc. Now that France has taken the initiative to propose the Anglo-French alliance, Britain is naturally happy to see it succeed.</p>
<p>Therefore, the conclusion of an alliance treaty by Britain and France before the opening of the peace conference has a very close relationship with the European political situation and the future of the peace conference. From a pessimistic perspective, it is a serious question whether the Soviet Union, seeing the Anglo-French alliance, can avoid regarding it as the predecessor of a Western European bloc. At that time, if the Soviet Union's attitude towards France inevitably changes, then in the peace conference, the Soviet Union may adopt an uncompromising attitude. Therefore, we are really not overly optimistic about the peace conference held in Paris on May 1st. The foreign ministers' meeting has already failed, and the Soviet Union is unwilling to let go of its interests in the Balkan Peninsula. How can we hope that this meeting will produce concrete results? On the other hand, from an optimistic perspective, if Anglo-Soviet relations can improve, and the Soviet Union can fully understand the Anglo-French alliance, and is willing to expand this alliance treaty into a three-power treaty, then the Anglo-French alliance will definitely make many contributions to world peace, and the Paris Peace Conference can proceed smoothly.</p>

Prosecutor Dai Rongduo and others from the High Procuratorate had also arrived early. When the two large iron gates opened at 8:15 AM, two ten-wheeled jeep trucks of the Military Affairs Commission drove in. In the leading vehicle, Dong Hao 1420041, sat nine neatly dressed "guests" leisurely, politely passing around a pack of cigarettes. The only thing that spoiled the scene was that several armed comrades of the "Dingping" unit with guns were sitting in the middle. At 8:22 AM, another six vehicles drove in, two of which, like the first batch, were dedicated to carrying the luggage and bedding of these "guests."

<h3>Liao Di Xin Escorted to Suzhou</h3>
<p>Recruiting Troops with Malicious Intent</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Liao Di Xin, who successively served as a Lieutenant General Staff Officer in the Military Commission of the puppet regime and as Commander of the Fourth Column of the Zhejiang Coastal Defense Headquarters, went into hiding in Sijiao after his misdeeds were revealed. He dispatched his followers to sneak into Nanjing and Shanghai, specifically to recruit vagrant soldiers and scattered troops, plotting illicit activities. The Shanghai Garrison Headquarters arrested Liao in the middle of last month at his "Shanghai Office" located at No. 5 Anning Road, Wujin Road, and subsequently apprehended more than sixty accomplices. After this case was exposed by this newspaper, the Procuratorate of the Capital District Court immediately sent a telegram stating, "This office is currently investigating the case of Zhang Zhongding, of the puppet organization's court, privately recruiting troops, and the original files show that the defendant was instructed by Liao Di Xin to recruit troops and serve the puppet government. At that time, Liao Di Xin also had the crime of jointly plotting and instigating anti-Japanese troops to desert and join the puppet government for peace movement. This office has attempted to arrest him but failed. Currently, the case file has been submitted to the superior procurator for review. Please escort Liao promptly to the Jiangsu High Court Procuratorate for further investigation and prosecution." Yesterday, it was learned that General Commander Li has approved the escort of Liao to the Suzhou High Court Procuratorate for interrogation and prosecution.</p>

<h3>After Foreign Orders Arrive, Paper Prices Expected to Decline, Enemy and Puppet Paper Products Being Processed for Sale</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] A reporter recently inquired about the paper shortage with the person in charge of the China Paper Industry Company, who stated: Although the stock of various types of paper in the city is not abundant, the market price is trending downward due to the influence of foreign paper orders and the disposal of enemy and puppet paper products by the Enemy and Puppet Property Management Bureau. It is claimed that the current low price of foreign orders is three to four times lower than the price in the city, which is not uncommon. When the foreign orders arrive one after another in the future, the paper price in the city will gradually decline. In addition, all the enemy and puppet paper products received by the Enemy and Puppet Property Management Bureau have been handed over to the company for processing and sale. However, the received paper products are scattered in more than one hundred warehouses. It is now planned to concentrate these scattered paper products in a small number of warehouses for processing. The transportation has started on March 10th. By the end of March, the paper in more than 20 warehouses has been transported and concentrated, and it has been sold to the paper industry and various cultural institutions at a price that is 10% to 20% lower than the market price. The disposal will continue in the future to achieve the goal of stable and low prices.</p>
<h3>U.S. Aviation Industry Giant, Panton, Arrives in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Inspects Aviation Business in the Far East</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Panton, the chief engineer of the Douglas Aircraft Company, recently flew to Shanghai from the United States to inspect the aviation situation in the Far East. In an interview, he stated that China's need for aviation is greater than that of any other country in the world. When discussing the new trends in the aircraft manufacturing industry, Panton said that the most important issue for manufacturers at present is how to reduce the production cost of aircraft so that the general public can enjoy the convenience of air transportation. This is especially true in China because China has vast land and little railway transportation, so it is necessary to develop air transportation to make up for the deficiency.</p>
<h3>Senators Questioned the City's Budget and Final Accounts at the Ninth General Assembly Yesterday, Hoping to Prevent Tax Leakage and Ensure All Revenue Goes to the Public; Requests to Improve Flower Tax, Only Small Denomination Tickets Available</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The Provisional Municipal Council of this city held its ninth general assembly at 9:20 yesterday morning. Thirty-four councilors attended. Pu Zhengdong, Director of the Finance Bureau, reported on the financial situation:</p>
<p>Finance Bureau Report</p>
<p>Past Finances: According to the fiscal year 1936, the income of the old Municipal Government was 10,320,000 yuan, and the expenditure was 11,060,000 yuan. The income of the former British Public Works Department was 23,651,710 yuan, and the expenditure was 27,545,391 yuan. The income of the former French Concession Bureau was 9,759,406 yuan, and the expenditure was 11,687,741 yuan. Receiving Puppet Regime Assets: Office supplies, securities, and cash have all been reported to the municipal government and then to the central government for safekeeping or resolution. Securities and cash include: various frozen drafts, various valuable securities and bank deposits of the puppet Welfare Committee, valuable securities of the former Public Works Department, 200,000 shares of Shanghai Hengchan Co., Ltd. stock, 5,263 shares of various government bonds, and cash amounting to 18,236,837,884 yuan in puppet currency. Tax Revenue Items: Banquet tax is 20%, entertainment tax is 50%, house tax is collected at 14% of the land value set in 1937, plus 60 times. Business license tax is 0.5% of the current capital value, or 0.25% of the total annual turnover if the capital value cannot be calculated. Vehicle license tax is calculated according to the type and carrying capacity of the vehicle. Slaughter tax is 5%. Hotel tax is 20%. A total of 415 houses that have been inspected and re-leased, and 50 houses in Pudong. A total of 127,754,876,24 yuan in public debt from the old municipal government, the British and French Public Works Bureau, and the puppet organizations have been inspected. The Finance Bureau's income from September of last year to February of this year totaled 3,315,137,423 yuan, while the expenditure was 7,352,632,663 yuan. The Municipal Government General Affairs Office accounted for 9.24%, the Accounting Office 1.36%, the Civil Affairs Office 2.95%, the Police Bureau 32.03%, the Finance Bureau 3.61%, the Education Bureau 7.84%, the Public Utilities Bureau 6.87%, the Public Works Bureau 14.29%, the Health Bureau 10.51%, the Social Affairs Bureau 1.88%, the Land Bureau 4.67%, and others accounted for 4.175%. Plans to Overcome Current Difficulties: (1) Determine the total budget of revenue and expenditure, reduce or stop unnecessary expenditures; (2) Urge the Central Government to clear the various arrears that should be allocated after the recovery; (3) Implement the newly established financial revenue and expenditure system as soon as possible; (4) Request the allocation of enemy and puppet property to expedite urgent construction; (5) Clear up public funds and properties, and establish a special management agency; (6) Continue to rectify tax donations and cultivate tax personnel; (7) Implement local inheritance and carry out labor services; (8) Regulate the market and support industry and commerce. After Director Pu's report, before asking questions, Feng Youzhen made a temporary motion, saying that the Congress was about to open and should issue a declaration on the proceedings. He proposed the formation of a drafting committee composed of Xu Yongzuo, Feng Youzhen, Chuan Tongxian, Chen Xunyu, and Pan Xulun, which was unanimously approved.</p>
<p>Inquiries from Councilors</p>
<p>Zhan Wenhua inquired: (1) The municipal government plans to request the receipt of a portion of enemy and puppet materials for construction purposes. Why not request that a portion of the proceeds from the auction of enemy assets by the Enemy Property Management Bureau be used to enrich the municipal treasury? Can the municipal government's budget be made public? (2) What are the plans for issuing municipal government bonds? Xu Yongzuo also requested that the budget situation after the end of February be announced. According to the organizational regulations of the Municipal Provisional Council, the most important task of the councilors is to resolve the budget and review the final accounts. Pan Xulun's review report found that the expenditure of the Education Bureau accounted for 7.84%, which was too little, and the Public Works Bureau accounted for 14.29%, which should also be greatly increased, while the general affairs expenses accounted for 9.24% and the public utilities bureau accounted for 6.87%, which seemed too much. The business license tax has the effect of hindering the development of businesses by citizens and should be abolished. Cao Jun said that although the Finance Bureau said it was making every effort to prevent tax leakage, according to the report, the slaughter tax alone had many discrepancies. He hoped to further ensure that all revenue goes to the public and strictly prohibit tax collectors from engaging in corruption. Yong Xiangyun pointed out that only large denomination flower tax stamps are sold on the market, which wastes paper and time. Can large denomination tickets be issued? Ji Hao advocated minimizing the organization of the defense corps to reduce the burden on citizens. Feng Youzhen believes that it is worth considering whether provisional councilors have the right to review the final accounts and budget.</p>
<p>Director Pu's Reply</p>
<p>Director Pu replied to various points: (1) There are plans to allocate the proceeds from the sale of enemy and puppet materials to the municipal treasury. (2) It is difficult to issue government bonds at the current high interest rates, so they cannot be issued for the time being. (3) The budget was prepared last year, but there are many discrepancies between the calculation and the current situation, and it has not yet been approved by the central government, so it has not been released. Compensation funds are allocated by the central government in installments. (4) The purpose of the business license tax is to crack down on and reduce luxury businesses. It is set by the central government and is being requested from the Ministry of Finance for approval. The slaughter tax has not been adjusted for half a year, so there are naturally discrepancies. The meeting adjourned at 11:45.</p>
<p>Tenth General Assembly Discusses Proposals</p>
<p>The report from the various bureaus of the Municipal Government to the Provisional Municipal Council of the city was completed yesterday morning. The tenth general assembly was held at 3:15 p.m. The assembly reviewed the proposals as a whole. Twenty-eight councilors attended. Councilor Yu Zhijing has registered, and Councilor Li Denghui has resigned, and Councilor Xu Guomao has been re-elected and has also registered. Speaker Xu Jiqing first presented the report of the third review committee on education and culture, and requested a resolution from the assembly. As a result, the following were passed: (1) All agencies and troops occupying school buildings should be ordered to move out immediately; (2) Sufficient funds should be allocated to subsidize private schools; (3) The Education Bureau should be requested to use the existing school buildings and equipment of municipal primary and secondary schools in the city to establish ordinary and vocational supplementary schools at all levels; (4) Primary school education should focus on Chinese, and English should be a non-essential subject. Lu Sitan proposed to change "English" to "Foreign Language" and other proposals. The second review committee submitted proposals for review on finance, economy, and construction, which were passed: (1) The Central Government should be recommended by this council to quickly enact and promulgate the "Urban Housing Lease Management Regulations" to regulate urban housing leases and reduce disputes and difficulties. (2) In the name of this council, a telegram should be sent to the Central Government requesting that a portion of the income from the disposal of enemy and puppet properties within the Shanghai urban area be allocated to Shanghai as funds for local reconstruction and construction. (3) The Municipal Government should be requested to construct a Pujiang tunnel to facilitate transportation on the west bank of the Huangpu River. (4) The enemy property wharf and warehouse in this city should be requested by the Executive Yuan to be transferred to the Shanghai Municipal Government for takeover. (5) Speculation should be curbed, investment should be guided, and the social economy should be stabilized. It is advocated that the resumption of the stock exchange should be approved first. (6) The Central Government should be requested to expedite the start of work on the enemy and puppet factories that have been taken over, and to encourage private factories to resume work, so as to accommodate unemployed workers and increase production. (7) The Municipal Government should be requested to actively develop the suburbs. (8) The Municipal Government should be requested to work with the Garrison Headquarters to quickly investigate occupied houses and fairly allocate them for residence to solve the most serious housing shortage in this city. (9) The Mayor submitted a proposal that the municipal treasury is extremely stretched, and it is planned to continue collecting hotel taxes. The meeting adjourned at 6:30 p.m. Other proposals that have not been resolved will be discussed at the next general assembly.</p>
<p>The drafting committee of the closing declaration of the Municipal Provisional Council, Chen Xunyu, Feng Youzhen, and others, will discuss the drafting matters next Monday. The first review committee appointed Shen Chunhui and Wang Genzhong as representatives, the second committee appointed Xu Yongzuo and Xu Shihao as representatives, and the third committee appointed Feng Youzhen and He Bingsong.</p>
<p>Citizens' Opinions Received, Can Be Classified into Six Categories</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Since the opening of the Provisional Municipal Council of this city, 43 opinions from citizens have been received, totaling 62 items. After sorting, they can be classified as follows: (1) Housing rentals: 9 items, most of which raised the unreasonableness of using gold bars to top up housing prices, the illegal exploitation of residents by sublessors, and the arbitrary manipulation of rents, but the fundamental key is to solve the housing shortage; (2) Industry and Commerce: 14 items: 1. Propose to assess rice prices and allocate food; 2. Crack down on illegal speculation and ensure normal investment; 3. Reduce banquet donations, and exempt daily food from donations; 4. Thoroughly eliminate the strike and go-slow trend; 5. Suggest that the government adopt "economic policies"; 6. Pay attention to private shops and check account books, etc.; (3) Health: 8 items: 1. Clear up garbage in alleys and dredge sewers; 2. Add public toilets and trash cans; 3. Crack down on night soil collectors, pay attention to extortion, and prevent embezzlement; 4. Please build clinics in Zhabei and Nanshi, etc.; (4) Public Utilities: 7 items: 1. Adjust the route stops and times of public buses in Nanshi; 2. Correct the methods for renewing bicycle licenses; 3. Recover transportation tools operated by foreign merchants, and connect the trams of the former two concessions; 4. Add street lights in alleys (especially in Nanshi); 5. Open the closed water taps in western Shanghai, etc.; (5) Civil Administration and Police: 9 items: 1. Abolish and investigate the puppet Baojia chiefs; 2. Crack down on dance halls; 3. Improve the quality and treatment of police officers; 4. Thoroughly abolish the prostitution system, etc.; (6) Others: 15 items: 1.

Amend the marriage law and stipulate a monogamous system; (7) Improve teacher qualifications and improve teaching materials.</p>
<p>Use Guild Organizations to Handle Enemy and Puppet Materials</p>
<p>Luo Qinghua proposed that although the Enemy and Puppet Property Management Bureau has a very small number of industrial and commercial figures participating in the review committee, it only knows how to trust the Sanwu Department Store for handling materials, and has never known how to use the organizational strength of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce and various industry guilds, which has led to protracted delays and increasing confusion, which is regrettable. To this day, not only is the loss of materials painful, but the warehouses have been sealed for a long time, resulting in the relief supplies transported to Shanghai by the Relief Administration, and the export of inland tea cocoons and other local products in the near future, all having nowhere to store. Therefore, it is imperative to dispose of and receive materials and clear the sealed warehouses. The only way to change the plan is to use the organizations of various industries to coordinate the processing. Therefore, it is proposed that the government quickly take the following emergency measures: 1. Order the warehouse industry and customs declaration industry to send personnel to cooperate with the customs and the commodity inspection bureau to conduct a time-limited inventory of the materials sealed in each warehouse, classify them, create a roster, and announce the quantity. 2. Expand the organization of the review committee, recruit impartial people from important industries to serve as members, and re-examine and revise the processing methods. 3. The review committee should classify the sealed materials, discuss and determine the processing methods, and estimate the minimum and maximum prices for announcement at any time. 4. The materials should be classified and handed over to the respective industry associations, and the time limit for selling the sealed materials should be set. The legitimate profits of the distributors should be verified, and price increases and manipulation should not be allowed, and non-industry people should be prevented from hoarding. 5. If it is an industrial raw material, the manufacturer in this industry has the right to preferentially purchase it, and it is stipulated that deferred payment and other methods can be applied. 6. The review committee should discuss and set a deadline for the classification and clearance. If the sale is not completed by the deadline, the estimated price will be reduced, or the goods will be auctioned publicly, and the deadline will be ended. If there are still inferior products that cannot be sold by the deadline, they will be handed over to the municipal government for management. Another proposal by Shi is to commemorate the late U.S. President Roosevelt. It is proposed that the government change the racecourse on Nanjing West Road in this city into Roosevelt Park and erect a monument to show respect and lasting memory.</p>
<h3>Coincidence: Bulky Guns and Ammunition in Sacks</h3>

Once the real estate is sold by bid, the leased agencies and groups must move out.</p>
<h3>Scalping Tickets of China Merchants Steam Navigation Company</h3>
<p>Owner and Staff of Ticket Agency Detained</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper] In order to eliminate scalping, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company requires passengers to sign in person when purchasing tickets for each route. Tickets to Qingdao, Tianjin, Taiwan, Guangdong, etc. also require photos to prevent resale. However, letters of introduction or reservations from various agencies continue to pour in, and the passenger ticket department can hardly cope with them. It is reported that the last voyage of the Zhoushan Wheel to Ningbo was announced to be full. Ma, an employee of the transportation team of a certain agency, used his official position to purchase five tickets for the Zhoushan Wheel from the passenger transportation department of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company and sold them to a small ticket agency for resale to passengers at black market prices. The external affairs team of the agency seized the incident and reported it to the authorities, who transferred it to the military police team for thorough investigation. The team detained the female owner and staff of the ticket agency for interrogation. The ticket agency then asked Ma for help. Ma admitted to being an employee of a certain agency and went to the military police team to bail out the detained female owner of the ticket agency. The military police team had already detected that Ma was also a criminal and was about to arrest him. He was detained for investigation and will be transferred to the court for prosecution. It is reported that the agency will not sell tickets to anyone who does not come to the agency in person to purchase them in the future.</p>

They planned to cross the river to Pudong first and stay overnight, and then take a bus to Suzhou to start a small family. The patrol class found their expressions flustered and suspicious and took them to the branch for questioning. According to Zhao and Yin, they met the young and beautiful girls at the Yangjiadu Temple Fair two days ago. They were all of secondary school education and fell in love at first sight. They planned to go to Suzhou together, rent a house first, and then start a business to make a living permanently. All four girls covered their faces and cried silently. They were taken to the branch for further questioning.</p>

<h3>Bulls Continue to Push Upward, Public Bonds Still Rising, Chinese and Foreign Stocks Both Fall</h3>
<p>After falling, public bonds were pulled up again. Class C bonds initially opened around 4300 yuan, falling to 4150 yuan mid-session. After large investors sold, they aggressively bought, driving the price up to 4600 yuan, then hovered. Bullish activity remained strong, with a firm process. At noon, it hovered around 4550 yuan, up 550 yuan from the previous close. Miscellaneous bonds traded poorly and were the weakest. Classes A, B, and E each rose 250 yuan, while Class D only rose 100 yuan. The Chinese stock market was uncertain. Although there was a bullish trend mid-session, it was difficult to reach new highs. After several days of consecutive gains, the competition between bulls and bears gradually reached equilibrium. The market opened lower this morning, following the previous night's trend. Bulls bought on the dip. Mid-session, Wing On Textiles rose to 5500 yuan, Meiya to 4400 yuan, and King Fook to 450 yuan, then hovered without further gains. Wing On Textiles fell to 5000 yuan, Meiya to 4080 yuan, and King Fook below 220 yuan. Money was unusually loose, with even more excess funds in Sichuan banks. At noon, the market stabilized, resulting in a decline of between half and one-tenth compared to the previous close. Foreign stocks continued to fall. Except for Ken Zhi, which saw more buyers due to the initial activity, the rest fell upon opening. The market was weakest mid-session. At noon, it stabilized slightly, resulting in a further decrease of half to over one-tenth compared to the previous close. Ken Zhi rose again by a strong half.</p>
<h3>Calm in the Gold Market</h3>
<p>The gold market was very calm yesterday. It opened steadily this morning, with no activity. Although the supply was small, it still gradually decreased to 1.455 million. The Bank of China's allocation price remained unchanged, having no impact. Afterwards, funds were loose and abundant. Investors took profits on dips. At noon, it recovered slightly after falling. The afternoon was also stable. The result was similar to the previous close. The listed price for decorative gold was also stable, remaining at 160,000 yuan. Silver was 1600, silver dollars were weak, and unofficial interest rates were slightly lower due to tighter speculative outlets, ranging from 0.13 to 0.18 yuan.</p>
<h3>Stagnant U.S. Dollars, Stable Hong Kong Dollars</h3>
<p>Foreign currency U.S. dollars were stagnant, initially around 1920 yuan, then retreating to below 1900 yuan mid-session. The market stabilized slightly at noon and in the afternoon, hovering around 1910 yuan, resulting in a decrease of ten yuan from the previous close. Hong Kong dollars were stable, slightly stronger mid-session, but remained quiet as old holdings were settled, failing to cross the 400 mark. In the end, it leveled off. The result was not significantly different from the previous close. The Robbie Hong Kong telegraph was calm, with little trading.</p>
<h3>U.S. Export-Import Bank Grants Five Loans to China</h3>
<p>To Assist China in Restoring Production</p>
<p>[Reuters Washington, 6th] Regarding the five loans from the Export-Import Bank to China, according to the bank's chairman, Martin: The purpose of these loans is to promote the construction of China's transportation and electricity systems, and will only be used to restore damaged equipment, not to expand new equipment. The loans will help China restore foreign trade.</p>
<h3>Grass Green Woolen Fabrics are Strong</h3>
<p>Grass green broadcloth and gabardine have recently been popular in the market, with firm retail and wholesale prices. This is because the official goods circulating in the market are very scarce. The limited goods received from enemy property seizures have also been gradually distributed and are mostly silk thread and rayon. Like No. 500, they were all re-dyed dark blue by the China Textile Company and distributed. This has led to a shortage of grass green broadcloth and woolen fabrics, making them strong. The continuous purchases by merchants from Nanjing, Anqing, Wuhu, and Hangzhou are also a major reason.</p>
<h3>Neither Yarn nor Cotton Show Improvement</h3>
<p>The yarn market still lacked progress yesterday due to sluggish sales. Only a small number of merchants from Beijing and Wuhu bought a few dozen pieces of 20-count small yarn. Merchants from Hunan and Hubei have been inactive since the beginning of this month, and merchants from Guangdong are also slow to purchase. Therefore, market transactions are very rare and lifeless. The price of each yarn has fallen by another 20,000 to 30,000 yuan. It is said that major yarn mills are willing to sell, but there are few buyers. Judging from the current yarn market, it will be difficult to improve without large purchases from merchants. Yesterday, the Spinning and Construction Company began selling 18 types of woolen fabric, 2 types of blankets, and 4 types of sewing thread.</p>
<p>Yesterday, New York cotton prices rose by 8 to 18 points, with some mid-term prices rising by 24 points. Near-term prices were US$28.04, and far-term prices were US$28.24, showing a pattern of lower near-term prices and higher far-term prices. Spot price of middling cotton was US$28.63. Spot cotton transactions in this city were still good, but the market was constrained by the lack of improvement in yarn and cloth. The market value was lowered by about one or two thousand yuan.</p>
<h3>Sugar Standards Not Passed</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the association held another auction for sugar. A total of 3,000 bags of raw sand red sugar, priced at 47,000 yuan, and 1,200 bags of white sugar in three and a half cars, priced at 72,000 yuan, were sold. Only a few hundred bags were sold, failing to sell out. The listing price for high-quality green sugar was a few dozen bags at 51,500 yuan. Merchants from Shantou offered 55,000 yuan for high-quality green sugar and 70,000 yuan for high-quality rock sugar, but no transactions were made. The trend is flat and weak.</p>
<h3>Seafood Market Opens with Declining Prices</h3>
<p>Seafood prices have been softening recently and have not yet turned around. Yesterday, the listings in the southern market showed the price of Jian Yao dried scallops at 135,000 yuan, followed by 128,000 yuan to 115,000 yuan. Fujian flower mushrooms were 845,000 yuan to 827,000 yuan, and lower-grade dried scallops were only 785,000 yuan. Jian Yao mushrooms were 440,000 yuan, all showing declines compared to previous prices.</p>
<h3>Selling Pressure Envelops the Coal Market</h3>
<p>Coal market transactions are sparse, and the downward trend is difficult to reverse. In terms of prices, except for white coal lumps, which were previously in short supply and had high prices, they are now continuing to decline. For other types of coal, such as bituminous coal and white coal dust, although the prices have not continued to decline, the overall market sentiment is unusually weak. This is because there are many sellers and few buyers, so the market is unable to rally.</p>
<h3>Construction Hardware Declines</h3>
<p>Asphalt and Oil Felt Are More Popular Than Before</p>
<p>Recently, construction hardware prices have been fluctuating, with more declines than gains overall. Prices for galvanized iron, cement, and ribbed steel bars are all lower than before. The price of 3'x6' flat galvanized iron has suffered a major setback due to the dumping of goods from the Jianghai Customs. Since the arrival of Tianjin Horse Brand barrel cement in Shanghai, the cement market has plummeted, severely impacting local factory goods, which have not yet turned around. There are still ample inventories of ribbed steel bars, but actual sales are not satisfactory, causing the market to soften. Other items, such as asphalt and oil felt, are more popular than before, especially U.S. No. 2 oil felt, which is 60% higher than when it first arrived. Because the market inventory of this product is low and actual sales have been strong recently, it is becoming increasingly scarce. The current retail price is 65,000 to 66,000 yuan per roll. Due to the lower supply of asphalt from Texaco and the strong actual sales in this market, the market price has risen. Furthermore, the demand for asphalt in the interior is greater than for roofing felt, so the purchase price is now higher than the selling price.</p>
<h3>Foreign Insurance Companies Given Three Months to Register</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The Ministry of Finance has issued three regulations regarding the resumption of business by foreign insurance companies, which are becoming increasingly numerous, ordering all provinces and cities to comply: (1) Foreign insurance companies that had branches in China before the war, which were suspended due to the war, and now seek to resume business, must apply for supplementary registration in accordance with the law within three months of the issuance of this order. Failure to do so within the deadline will result in suspension of business. (2) Those that had branches before the war, but only conducted insurance business in the name of agents, and are still operating, must apply for registration in accordance with the law within three months of the issuance of this order. Failure to do so will result in a mandatory suspension of business. (3) All insurance policies issued by foreign insurance companies in China must be in Chinese.</p>
<h3>Canadian Loan Balance to Continue Purchasing Transportation Materials</h3>
<p>Of the loans China has received from Canada, transportation materials account for US$20 million. In addition to the already purchased 1 million railroad ties (US$2 million) and 16 ships (US$4 million), an additional purchase of 1,000 kilometers of steel rails and 1,000 sets of rail joints has been requested, valued at US$6.74 million. The remaining balance is US$7.26 million. It has been learned that the Ministry of Communications finalized the plans for continued purchases by the end of March, including railroad ties (US$3 million), ships (US$3 million), and telecommunications materials (US$1.26 million). Efforts will be made to ship these materials as soon as possible.</p>
<h3>Summary of Market Conditions</h3>
<p>Longan Fruit: Quanzhou large dried longan fruit is very stable in the market. Yesterday's listings were more numerous, with over 500 baskets being sold at a price of 60,000 yuan, with lower prices for lower quality goods.</p>
<p>Tea: The market is declining and has not yet recovered. Dealers are selectively buying, but transactions are sluggish and unable to improve. Prices are decreasing every day.</p>
<p>Cotton Cloth: The China Textile Company is supplying large quantities for transport to Japan, causing market prices to plummet.</p>
<p>Cotton Textiles: Flat and sluggish, but Dafa bed sheets are slightly firmer.</p>
<p>Silk: Prices for high-grade raw silk remain unchanged, while there are more sellers of medium-grade silk. Labor unrest in silk factories has not been completely resolved, so prices are softening again. Rayon is also following a downward trend. The silk market is flat. Recently, empty shell companies have emerged, targeting Dachong Bi Crepe, dumping large quantities, causing the market to plummet. However, because the market price is too far from the factory price (3700 yuan), the short sellers are facing difficulties.</p>
<h3>British and Australian Efforts to Develop Rayon Industry</h3>
<p>Latest Rayon Woolen Fabrics</p>
<p>[British Information Service, London, 5th] Golders Silk Factory is producing a new type of rayon woolen fabric. This is the result of British research on rayon and proves that silk and wool can be combined to weave a new fabric for the foreign market. This new fabric has a wide range of uses. For example, a gray-green tropical suit is woven from silk and wool, and it does not shrink after repeated washing. Another type of fabric made of white silk and brown wool is also durable.</p>
<p>Australia Establishes Rayon Factory</p>
<p>[British Information Service, London, 5th] According to New South Wales Premier McKell, commercial negotiations between the New South Wales government and Golders Silk Factory of England have concluded. Golders Silk Factory will establish a rayon factory in New South Wales, with an estimated cost of 5 million pounds, covering an area of approximately 500 acres, employing 4,000 workers, and planning to hire British experts and staff.</p>
<p>British Factories Spend Huge Sums on Research</p>
<p>Golders Silk Factory is continuing its important research on British rayon and has donated 600,000 pounds to the University of Leeds, specifically for textile students to conduct various research (the University of Leeds' textile department is renowned for its research on the woolen industry). In June 1944, Golders Silk Factory resolved to allocate 500,000 pounds for research on important issues in the rayon industry. The donation to the University of Leeds is the factory's second donation from this research fund to the University of Leeds.</p>

<h3>Elementary School Teachers in Beiping Take Collective Leave</h3>
<p>To Demand Improved Treatment</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Beiping, 5th] Elementary and secondary school teachers in Beiping have taken collective leave since yesterday to demand improved treatment. On the 3rd, Director of Education Mo Qianli met with representatives and said that the mayor also sympathized with the teachers' plight and would make strong appeals on their behalf to the relevant authorities in the central government and the city of Beiping.

Representatives of the teachers' association said that they would continue to take leave if a satisfactory solution was not reached.</p>
<h3>Japanese Education System Must Be Thoroughly Reformed</h3>
<p>Report from the U.S. Education Inspection Team</p>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 6th] After a detailed study of the Japanese education system, the U.S. Education Inspection Team today submitted its final report, outlining a comprehensive plan to reform Japanese education. The report stated that in view of the responsibility for Japanese children, Japanese education must be thoroughly reformed. The Japanese language is a major obstacle to student development. Students spend a considerable amount of time learning to write Japanese, which could be used to learn other languages and basic knowledge of skills or science and social conditions. The report also proposed the following reforms: (1) Children under the age of sixteen must attend school, and tuition fees will be subsidized by the government. (2) Train teachers to effectively use teaching materials. (3) Course design and textbook selection must be discussed with teachers. (4) Revise history and geography textbooks, removing mythological portions. (5) Implement moral education to prepare children for future democratic life. (6) Implement health education, focusing on nutrition, health, and public health issues. (7) Maximize opportunities to educate adults. (8) Promote vocational education. (9) Make higher education accessible to the public, not just the privilege of a few. To implement the above plan, educational administration should be decentralized rather than as centralized as it is now. The power of the Ministry of Education should be reduced, and its responsibilities will only be to provide technical assistance and advice to various schools, with little direct control over local schools.</p>

At a time when prices are rising and economic pressure is high, it is truly commendable to undertake such difficult work. The country has gone through a long period of war, and the economic situation is difficult to recover for a while.

<h3>City Council Receives Citizen's Letter of Opinion, Calls for Ban on Cartoon Strip Stalls</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Dagongshe] Cartoon strip stalls line the roads and alley entrances throughout the city, attracting semi-literate, ignorant street children and apprentices. The language in these books is vulgar, and the content is absurd, leading to distorted thinking and indirectly corrupting social morals. Yesterday, the City Council received multiple letters of opinion from citizens, the most striking of which called for the banning of small book stalls (i.e., cartoon strip stalls). It is reported that the City Council attaches great importance to the above suggestion, and the administrative authorities will soon issue a clear prohibition.</p>
<h3>Student Parents Oppose Second Tuition Fee Collection</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from This City] Since the news of the school collecting a second tuition fee was released, student parents throughout the city have been extremely anxious due to the unbearable burden. Consequently, a group of parents gathered yesterday to discuss the matter. They unanimously agreed that since the people have already fulfilled their tax obligations, their children should have the right to free national education. Paying tuition fees is already an extra burden for the people, so how can they bear to be charged again? Education is the foundation of nation-building, and teacher funding should be planned by the government as a whole. The government must be responsible for improving the lives of teachers and cannot simply exploit the people. Therefore, they unanimously opposed the collection of the second tuition fee and decided to hold a reception for all sectors of society at the Great New Public Company Fellowship Association on Lauer Road at 3:00 PM today to publish a statement to parents throughout the city.</p>

<h3>Looking at New York Through Financial Figures</h3>
<p>— New York Airmail Dispatch, March 11, Special Correspondent Zhu Jia Reads</p>
<p>It has been over two months since I came to this great city. If one only observes its superficial prosperity, one cannot truly understand New York. Therefore, today I want to observe it from the perspective of the city's management functions, specifically by exploring the financial budget, the "mother of all administrative affairs," to see what policies their authorities are using to maintain and promote such a situation.</p>
<p>Strangely enough, even in this wealthiest city in the world, where the Wall Street financial center is located, the New York City government still complains about being short of money when budgeting for the entire year. Revenue and expenditure cannot be balanced, and they have no choice but to borrow. The outstanding debt from the past is already considerable, and it seems that this year's difficulties remain, which is the first headache for the new mayor, O'Dwyer. The future solutions are nothing more than subsidies from the state government and increased tax revenue. However, the legislative procedures in the United States are cumbersome, and it is unknown when a resolution can be reached. Now, let's take a look at their revenue and expenditure allocation, which may be useful for our reference.</p>
<h3>Part of the Annual Budget Has No Source of Funds</h3>
<p>According to Peter Grimm, the vice chairman of the Citizens Budget Commission of New York, the total budget figure for New York City this year is 863 million, of which 100 million currently has no source of funds. The mayor plans to increase taxes to fill the gap. Grimm also broke down the budget figures into eight categories, listing the percentages as follows:</p>
<p>Debt: 22.7%</p>
<p>Education: 20.3%</p>
<p>Welfare, Hospitals, and Healthcare: 16.5%</p>
<p>Police: 9.1%</p>
<p>Fire Department: 5%</p>
<p>5.1% [Unspecified]</p>
<p>Health: 4.5%</p>
<p>Water Supply: 0.7%</p>
<p>Other [Including Administrative Expenses]: 21.1%</p>
<p>Total: 100.0%</p>
<p>According to the above statistics, it can be seen that the annual debt repayment and interest payment figures for New York City rank high, and the accumulated deficits over the years are indeed alarming. The second largest expense is administrative fees, accounting for 21.1% of the total. The main expenses in this category are office expenses and salaries for government agencies, as well as the expenses of public libraries and other institutions. Education ranks third, accounting for 20.3%. Therefore, children and young people in New York enjoy higher standards than in other parts of the United States. During the war, New York City spent 182.8 dollars per student per year, which is better than Los Angeles's 159.4 and Detroit's 115.39. However, analyzing where the money goes, 85% of this 1.55 million yuan is spent on the salaries of 33,000 teachers and staff, while the remaining 15% is used for management, repairs, and purchasing supplies. However, this is still enough to show the level of treatment that their teaching staff enjoys.</p>
<h3>Generous Pay Encourages Loyalty and Diligence; Police Administration Is Clear and Effective</h3>
<p>Next, let's talk about the police. Currently, there are about 14,000 officers, which is not enough. The mayor has agreed to increase the number to 19,000 in the future. These days, they are recruiting, and more than 10,000 people have applied. The duties are divided into various categories, which are difficult to describe in detail. However, like other major cities, there are few police officers on the streets. It is said that these police officers, no matter how small their role, have an average annual salary of 3,420 dollars, and with other subsidies, they can usually earn 5,000 dollars a year. There are many bonuses here. Last year, the police department paid a total of 15 million dollars in bonuses. The reason why their police administration is relatively clear and effective is largely due to generous pay and encouragement of loyalty and diligence. Speaking of the Fire Department, it is said that New York City only has 8,000 firefighters, with an average of over a hundred buildings per person. However, because there are many fires and the workload is heavy, all are consumption expenditures. The firemen are talented in water and land firefighting, and their salaries and pensions are also very generous, so they account for more than 5% of the city's budget.</p>
<h3>Social Welfare Undertakings Focus on Relief Work</h3>
<p>Social welfare in New York City focuses on social relief, such as assisting the elderly who cannot support themselves, treating alcoholics, and providing care for the blind. In addition, there are 27 city-run hospitals with 20,500 beds to accommodate poor citizens, costing as much as 50 million dollars each year. Healthcare focuses on food inspection. The procedures for milk alone are quite cumbersome every day. It is said that usually 3.5 million units are inspected in detail by the Health Bureau, from the cow's udder to the bottling process. In addition, the Health Bureau's work includes venereal disease treatment, child care, and inspection of 100,000 food and drug stores. Therefore, many people are employed, and the expenses cannot be low.</p>
<p>Another 4.5% of the health budget is used for the removal and disposal of garbage and waste. In addition to incineration, one-third of these wastes are now filling up a lot of land. The cleanliness of the streets is also important, but labor costs are high, especially since there is often heavy snow here, a foot deep. Although there are snow plows, people still have to do the work, and it is conceivable that this labor cost will account for a considerable amount. Finally, although the water supply is compensated by water rates, the government still has to pay some money, so there is also a figure of 0.7%.</p>
<p>The above is a rough overview of the expenditures.</p>
<h3>The Main Source of Financial Revenue Is Real Estate Taxes</h3>
<p>Let's take a look at the income side. What are their main sources? According to Grimm's analysis, there are five main items, and the percentages are listed as follows:</p>
<p>Real Estate Tax: 55.6%</p>
<p>Ordinary Income: 26.3%</p>
<p>State Education Subsidies: 12.2%</p>
<p>Federal Welfare Subsidies: 2.4%</p>
<p>Other: 3.5%</p>
<p>According to the above analysis, the main source of revenue for New York City comes from real estate owners. The city government assesses the value of real estate throughout the city and charges 2.8 dollars per hundred. No wonder they are good at making money, supporting half of the city's finances. Second, the most important item in ordinary income is water tax, which is usually calculated based on water meters or buildings. The latter is tantamount to a double tax on real estate. The next is the sales tax, which is currently 1%. So, you have to pay extra tax no matter what you buy now. According to last year's statistics, the revenue from this tax was 41 million. Little things add up, and this is another example. It should be noted that the city collects more than this, but federal luxury taxes (such as the purchase of gold pens, gold watches, leather goods, and ornaments, which are subject to an additional 20% heavy tax), car license plates, gasoline, alcohol, and income taxes all go to the central or state government. The city government can only rely on state and federal government subsidies, as well as some public property income, as a source of revenue.</p>
<h3>Financial Situation Is Quite Awkward; Difficult to Cope with for the Time Being</h3>
<p>However, even with such an arrangement of the budget's revenue and expenditure situation, New York City's deficit this year is still quite awkward. To sum it up, there are four factors that are difficult to deal with: First, regarding postwar recovery, of the 12,000 to 15,000 former city employees who have served in the military, 90% of them are demanding reinstatement. This budget, including wartime bonuses, is expected to reach 57 million. In addition, an estimated 100 million or more is needed to restore or expand various pre-war and post-war municipal facilities. Second, to build schools, parks, hospitals, health centers, and organize drainage systems, 180 million is needed, and the new recurring expenses are also 76 million per year. Third, the New York subway is also losing money severely, and 50 million has to be bet on it every year. The current five-cent ticket price is too cheap. However, the mayor would rather increase the sales tax than raise the ticket price. Some members of the City Council suggested adding two cents some time ago. As a result, it was also rejected, but this has indeed become a heavy burden on the city's finances. What's more, this year's "prosperity" is not yet in full swing, and it is uncertain whether tax revenues can still maintain the original state. Therefore, a deficit budget has become a problem, and the golden city is really experiencing a financial panic.</p>
<p>According to Grimm, the only way to go is to borrow, but it is also frustrating that the state of New York has set a limit on the city's borrowing, which cannot exceed 10% of the average of five years' worth of real estate tax revenue. This range is already narrow, so it is necessary to find other ways, either by increasing subsidies from the state government, increasing taxes, or suspending non-urgent construction. Of course, they will have their own plans, and we don't need to worry about them. This dispatch is just to briefly observe how others are doing it. (March 11)</p>

<p>Prices are already like a wild horse that has broken free of its reins, leaping forward and running without looking back. Citizens are sinking into suffering, while merchants are gradually getting up, smiling with oily mouths. They remember the bleak scene of commercial depression after last year's victory, and now they are arrogantly invincible again. But the necks of the poor citizens are tightly fastened by the shackles of prices, making them unable to catch a breath.</p>
<h3>Wild Horse-like Prices Don't Even Turn Their Heads</h3>
<p>First, let's take a look at the prices in Wenzhou before the New Year (February 1):</p>

<h3>Rice Store Riot Unleashes a Tragedy</h3>
<p>From the above, we can see how crazy the price increase was in fifty days! People are groaning under its high pressure, and life is more miserable than during the war.</p>
<p>Following the jump in prices, rice prices also cast a heavy shadow over the people of Wenzhou. In mid-February, the price of rice was still maintained at around 17 or 18 catties per thousand yuan, but due to the fluctuations in prices, the rice merchants also turned black-hearted and hoarded the rice, and the supply on the market became a problem. However, the 140,000 people in the Wenzhou urban area cannot do without rice to maintain their lives, and the demand is still fixed. Therefore, the price of rice soared in leaps and bounds. By the end of February, it was only 7 catties per thousand yuan. The "rice weevils" still believed that rice prices would rise during this spring famine season, thinking that it was a rare commodity to be hoarded and not sold, claiming that there was no rice on the market. On the 20th, even 7 catties per thousand yuan could not be bought. Running all over the Wenzhou urban area, there was money but no rice to buy. This aroused public anger, and some people knocked on kerosene cans along the way, mobilizing a city-wide strike. A group of starving people rushed into the rice stores and rice mills in batches, destroying counters, baskets, machines, and sundries... For a time, the whole city was in an uproar. Everywhere, rice stores and rice mills were swarmed by the masses. All that could be seen were crowds of people, and grain and bamboo baskets flew together. The turmoil spread to every corner of the city. The police bureau, which was responsible for maintaining law and order, also mobilized all police officers to suppress the situation. However, those ragged policemen, dragging antique rifles, did not dare to say half a word when they saw the emotionally agitated masses and could only stand aside as spectators.</p>
<h3>Girl Lost and Found, Whole Family Smiles Through Tears</h3>
<p>— Airmail Dispatch, 4th, from the Capital Police Department</p>
<p>Xiang Guokai, chief secretary of the Chongqing Police Bureau during the war, had his youngest daughter taken away by a big girl adopted by a cook's wife and abandoned by the side of the small train tracks in the capital city. She was then moved and taken away by someone else. After half a day of searching, she was lost and found. The details of the incident are as follows:</p>
<p>The Zheng family lives behind the Central District Police Bureau on Taiping Road. Near noon on March 2nd, Mrs. Zhang went out shopping and ordered the male servant Lao Qian to take care of the child at home. At that time, a nine-year-old girl who was adopted by a cook at the Central District Police Bureau came to play. Lao Qian asked her to hold the one-year-and-five-month-old baby girl for a moment so that he could fetch water to wash things. Unexpectedly, the big girl took the baby and escaped through the back door towards the railway. It was noon, and Mrs. Zheng had just returned home from outside. After learning about this, she sent out search parties, but there was no news, and the whereabouts were unknown. About an hour later, Mr. Zheng rushed over after hearing the news. Director Li Deyang of the Central District Police Bureau immediately sent telegrams to various police stations to search and also telegraphed the Supervision Office of the General Bureau to notify the suburban Xiaguan bureaus to search together.</p>
<p>Afterwards, Lu Ren Officer of the General Bureau, former Township Police Bureau Chief Sun Siyi, and Section Chief Li Qianren of the East Suburban Police Bureau all came to study the search techniques. The result was a decision to use the old method of gonging to spread the news. Mr. Zheng and his family rushed to various places to search, but did not find anything after several hours. Although considerable effort had been made in the investigation, there were no clues. It was already past six o'clock.</p>
<p>Previously, the Zheng family had lost a one-year-and-one-month-old son to illness a week earlier, and now they had suffered this unexpected event, which was truly unbearable. As his wife was in great distress, good news suddenly came. Officer Yang Shuching of the Dragon King Temple Police Station and Cao Xi, together with two local constables, carried a baby, shouting, "Mr. Zheng's one-year-old little girl has been found!" Mr. Zheng and his wife hurried over to take the baby. The child had a lovely smile, and everyone present was overjoyed. According to Officer Yang Shuching, the nine-year-old girl first abandoned the one-year-old baby girl by the side of the needle path and then ran away. The abandoned baby cried loudly at the time and was then taken in by passersby Zhou Zhihe (41 years old, from Huai'an, resident of No. 11 Wufu Lane) and others. Later, people in the same courtyard heard the police station's gonging notification, and Chuan Wenbin (21 years old, from Huai'an) came to report the news. Mr. Zheng then gave cash gifts to the citizens and local constables respectively.</p>
<p>After the incident, Mr. Zheng told people that the nine-year-old girl adopted by the cook's family had such a wicked mind and should be given education and reformation to prevent future harm to society. The recovery of his little baby girl should be attributed to the special enthusiasm of some officers and the great effectiveness of the gonging. On the afternoon of that day, the child was found in less than two hours after the gonging, and its effectiveness was no less than that of foreign broadcasting. I don't have a radio, and gonging is suitable for the general public, especially for finding people, and should not be regarded as outdated. In addition, the enthusiasm of citizens and the police is also extremely important.</p>
<h3>After Two Days of Strike, Emergency Measures Decided</h3>
<p>The turmoil continued for two days, and the market strike resembled a semi-closure of shops for two days. Only after the rice shops and rice mills in the Wenzhou urban area were battered and left in disarray did people's anger subside.</p>
<p>Eighth District Administrative Inspector's Office Commissioner Zhang Shichen immediately convened leaders from all sectors of Yongjia to hold an emergency meeting to discuss emergency countermeasures, deciding on six measures:</p>
<p>(1) Starting from the 21st, the price of Yongjia second-grade white rice is set at twelve *shi jin* per 1,000 yuan. The purchase price of grain from rural areas by rice merchants is set at 5,600 yuan per 100 *jin*. If large households hoard and refuse to sell, a report can be made to the county government for official handling, and their stored grain will be forcibly purchased at the military grain purchase price.</p>
<p>(2) Borrow 10,000 *dan* of grain from the Field Grain Office (currently stored in Yongjia), to be issued to the Grain Trade Association and distributed to the market at the stipulated price. An immediate telegram will be sent to Shanghai to purchase enough to repay the loan in full. Any shortfall will be the responsibility of the County Chamber of Commerce and the County Council to raise funds to cover it.</p>
<p>(3) The Police Bureau will dispatch police to notify each of the damaged rice mills to repair their machinery overnight and resume operations immediately, and send troops to protect them.</p>
<p>(4) Encourage the reporting of large households in rural areas who hoard for speculation. Generous rewards will be given to informants.</p>
<p>(5) If any rice merchants or rice shops sell rice exceeding the stipulated price or if there is adulteration with water or other impurities, once discovered, severe punishment will be imposed without leniency.</p>
<p>(6) A Civil Food Adjustment Committee will be organized to commence civil food adjustment work immediately.</p>
<p>After the turmoil subsided, the fair-priced rice at twelve *shi jin* per 1,000 yuan should also appear on the market in a few days. However, due to difficulties arising from the source of grain and funds, it soon became a sporadic situation.</p>
<p>After the Eighth District Administrative Inspector's Office announced the price limit of twelve *shi jin* per 1,000 yuan, the amount of surplus grain transported into the urban area from the countryside immediately decreased and almost disappeared. Fair-priced rice required bringing a household registration card, and even after queuing for a whole day, it was not guaranteed to buy 500 yuan worth. The only option was to find the black market, but the black market was also restricted by the price limit, making it extremely difficult for food consumers to purchase rice. They petitioned the Commissioner's Office to abolish the price limit order. Therefore, Commissioner Zhang Baozhen convened the Yongjia County Civil Food Adjustment Committee on the 5th of this month. The meeting decided: in order to facilitate the flow of grain and stabilize grain prices, the grain price limit will be abolished from March 7th.</p>
<p>Recently, the price of rice has thus jumped to another level, with only six *jin* per 1,000 yuan. People are still enduring the tragic days of living in a state of semi-starvation under the high pressure of grain prices.</p>
<h3>Suffering from Anemia and Falling into Unemployment</h3>
<p>The entire social economy, after eight years of war, is showing signs of anemia. Due to various complex reasons, in Wenzhou, apart from a small number of wealthy and powerful people, the general middle and lower classes have a common feeling: "It's difficult to eat." Being able to eat a full three meals a day comfortably is truly not easy!</p>
<p>According to estimates from social figures here, since the victory, Wenzhou has consistently had nearly 10,000 people living in a state of unemployment. Finding a "rice bowl" in Wenzhou is no less difficult than in Shanghai and Hangzhou. In the past, during the war, elementary school teachers were looked down upon, but currently in Wenzhou, they are being fought over by unemployed so-called intellectuals for the meager salary of several thousand yuan per month, barely enough to stave off hunger! Recently, the county government recruited household affairs officers for rural township offices, and it is said that hundreds of people went to apply. Not long ago, the Central Cinema recruited female ushers, and a group of "Misses" who had received considerable education were "competing" there!</p>
<p>Furthermore, laborers who were envied by "scholars" in the past, such as rickshaw pullers and boatmen, have long lost their so-called considerable income. Now, a rickshaw puller runs around like a beast of burden all day, and after paying the rickshaw rental, it is not even enough to buy two or three *jin* of rice. If you walk through the docks, many rickshaw pullers and boatmen will come up to solicit business, which shows how tense their struggle for survival is.</p>
<p>Various government agencies are implementing layoffs. As a result, a large number of small, unattached civil servants have been squeezed out, unable to find "positions" for the time being, leaving them at a dead end.</p>
<p>Wenzhou, this coastal city with a population of 140,000, may it soon escape the shadow of poverty and turn towards the warm spring sunshine!</p>

<h3>Save Shandong</h3>
<p>— Lu Min</p>
<p>During the eight years of the War of Resistance, we resisted foreign aggression externally to seek international freedom and equality, and pursued peaceful unification internally to achieve national prosperity and happiness. The entire nation swore to devote itself to this cause, enduring hardships and remaining steadfast. Ultimately, justice triumphed over might, and righteousness defeated aggression. Joyful news spread throughout the country, and the nation rejoiced. This was the perfect opportunity for our people to recuperate, rebuild, and seize this once-in-a-millennium chance. However, just as foreign aggression was quelled, internal strife arose again, causing unrest throughout the country, especially in Shandong. Over the past eight years, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has used the name of resistance against Japan to carry out separatist activities. The power it has accumulated undermines national unity, causing fragmentation and disintegration. It destroys the ethics and morals of the people, plunders their assets, and endangers their lives. In the name of "democracy," it carries out separatist activities, distorting public opinion with heresy and coercing it with threats. The abuses and atrocities are too numerous to list. Here, I will briefly describe the most egregious examples:</p>
<p>"A Doctrine of Hanging a Sheep's Head While Selling Dog Meat." — The CCP's consistent style is to be duplicitous and deceitful, tricking enthusiastic outsiders into their trap. Recently, they have intensified their efforts, creating class antagonism everywhere and doing everything possible to incite discord. They even force husbands and wives to turn against each other and siblings to kill each other. They also use a large number of local ruffians and hooligans who commit all kinds of evil to launch</p>
<p>"Universal and Extremely Brutal Struggles," — even middle and lower-class families are not spared. Those who are struggled against, whether male or female, are stripped naked and humiliated, and their families are bankrupted. They are invariably subjected to methods such as being dragged by horses, buried alive, assassinated, and tortured to death. The so-called</p>
<p>"Dragging by Horses," — cannot be interpreted literally. This is a variation of the brutal Qin Dynasty torture of "dismemberment by five horses." All those who are struggled against or who do not submit to their deception are tied to the back of a horse with a long rope, and the horse is whipped to gallop until the flesh is a blur, the bones are exposed, and they are dragged to death. Women in the area who refuse to obey orders to watch performances and dances that destroy morality and shame, such as the *yangge* dance (similar to the hula dance, with lewd ditties hummed in the mouth), are stripped naked, their bodies completely bare, and two people drag them by their feet along the ground, their faces crushed, their breasts scraped off, a sight too horrible to bear, until they die. Their bodies are then discarded in the wilderness, left for dogs to devour, as a warning to others. In the space of a month, tens of thousands have been "dragged by horses." Recently, they have also set a</p>
<p>"Three-Month Plan," — to completely slaughter all the local elites within three months. Directly and indirectly, countless people have died as a result. The remaining people, all those between the ages of eighteen and fifty, are all</p>
<p>"Forcibly Conscripted into the Militia." — If they resist or evade, they are immediately executed or their families are severely punished. The law of joint responsibility is also established to bind them. Each person is given four hand grenades and driven to the front lines to sabotage transportation and attack the National Army. When they launch sneak attacks, they adopt the inhumane</p>
<p>"Five-Wave Human-Wave Tactics," — that is, using militia, hundreds of times more numerous than the National Army, as the vanguard, attacking in five waves, while the communist troops cover the rear with machine guns to urge them on. The purpose is to use the lives of a large number of innocent people to deplete the limited ammunition of the National Army, using the common people as cannon fodder and human lives as tools. Their insidious motives and wolfish nature are such. Therefore, everyone feels insecure and strives to escape, but under their strict surveillance, it is impossible to escape the communist-controlled areas. For whenever the communist party arrives at a place, they first</p>
<p>"Block Traffic." — They force villagers to guard posts and interrogate pedestrians. Travel between neighboring villages is impossible without a pass stamped with a chain of seals from the district chief, village chief, head of the regiment, and head of the National Salvation Association. Recovered areas are all on the list of blocked areas and cannot be traveled to. Those who disobey will be buried alive. The reality of their policy of freedom of speech is that two people dare not whisper to each other, otherwise, once detected, they will be labeled</p>
<p>"Ideologically Stubborn, Reactionary, or a National Army Spy," — and few will escape with their lives. All radio receivers in small and medium-sized cities are confiscated within two days of the communist troops occupying the area, to implement their slogan of "freedom." Forcing donations and seizing weapons is no longer surprising. In the meantime, sleeping with closed doors is prohibited, and the communist party can enter and exit at will,</p>
<p>"Property and Chastity are Subject to Thefts." — During the day, they use the pretext of meetings to force young women to participate in order to satisfy their lust and insult them. If the women's fathers object to their going, they will be forced to make their "fathers and daughters, fathers-in-law and daughters-in-law dance" — in order to humiliate them. Therefore, everyone eagerly awaits the government's rescue, like a great drought longing for rain clouds. If this thought is detected, they will be severely tortured. After torture, more than ten tables are stacked up and the victim is forced to kneel on top, and then the tables are pushed over, causing the victim to fall to the ground and die, and this is called</p>
<p>"Looking at the Sky Celebration." — Intellectuals who refuse to be exploited are regarded as thorns in their flesh and needles in their eyes, either suffering assassination or disappearing at night. Recently, students in Yantai questioned the communist party's behavior of insulting women and more than ten were killed on the spot, and more than fifty disappeared that night. Private collections of books are all forced to be reported. Except for *On New Democracy*, *Coalition Government*, *Dialectical Materialism*, and other communist books, all are taken away and burned, to complete Qin Shi Huang's unfinished task of</p>
<p>"Burning Books and Burying Scholars Alive." — Hundreds of thousands of bags of relief supplies such as flour from the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration were shipped to North China a month ago, but the people have not seen a single grain of flour. All of it has been used to supply the communist army, increasing its power to attack the National Army, sabotage transportation, disrupt the area, and harm the people. Recently, a large number of people have been risking their lives to escape. Seeing this, the communist party has resorted to even more vicious means. Men who are outside, whether they have recently escaped or were originally outside, are forced to have their families call them back before the end of May, otherwise, in addition to confiscating their family property, all the women in their families between the ages of sixteen and fifty will be</p>
<p>"Forcibly Assigned to Bandits to Satisfy Their Bestial Desires." — The various atrocities are too numerous to record. The hideous faces behind their masks, and the extremely cruel methods, are unimaginable to those who have not experienced them firsthand. The people of Shandong are in such a dire situation, like water becoming deeper, like fire becoming hotter. If they are not rescued quickly, then there will be no survivors left in Shandong! The Soviet Union's activities in the industrial areas of Northeast China aroused the suspicion of the Chinese people. Special drawing by the Newspaper Data Room.</p>

<h3>The Future of Peking Opera</h3>
<p>— Shi Run</p>
<p>I am a layman when it comes to Peking Opera, but I am very interested in it, and I go to see a few performances every month.</p>
<p>I feel that Peking Opera is too conservative. It has not progressed or reformed at all. Are the signature performances of today's Peking Opera stars any different from those of Tan Xinpei when he served as an imperial performer? Forty or fifty years have passed since then. Can you find any signs of progress at all?</p>
<p>The wheel of time is moving forward and changing with each passing day. Yesterday's events are old history. If you don't keep up with the times, you will fall behind. Peking Opera has already fallen far behind the times. If it doesn't pick itself up and catch up, it will become like Kunqu Opera, and people will no longer pay attention to it. Fortunately, the distance between Peking Opera and the times is still visible, and it is still possible to catch up.</p>
<p>Mr. Ouyang Yuqian should be the pioneer of Peking Opera! It's just that his efforts ended in a Waterloo. I hope he deeply examines and reflects on the root causes of his failure. Remove the essence and keep the dross. Sitting on the cold benches of the theater to watch reheated leftovers is something that makes anyone's butt hurt. I wish Mr. Ouyang success in making a comeback and establishing a solid foundation for Peking Opera like that of film and spoken drama.</p>
<p>What are the strengths of Peking Opera? This is what those who want to reform Peking Opera should pay attention to. I think that the unique feature that allows Peking Opera to stand alongside film and spoken drama is its stylized singing, movements, music, and makeup, which are deeply in line with artistic principles. When we see the lines and actions in film and spoken drama, the throwing of a hand, a word, a movement, a state, an emotion, and a cough, all strive for realism and naturalness. However, the results are often unsatisfactory, appearing stiff, unnatural, and too mechanical. They never seem to be in the environment they are performing in, seeming artificial, making the audience feel goosebumps, feeling overdone, feeling that they are trying to look like it but failing. It cannot immerse the audience in the play. This is a shortcoming of film and spoken drama (especially spoken drama). As for why film and spoken drama have a wide audience, that is due to other reasons. Peking Opera sees through this point. Theater is ultimately theater. Rather than making the audience feel that it is not realistic or lifelike, it is better to make it conform to a certain rhythm, that is, to stylize it, and to devote itself to the expression of true art. Therefore, only Peking Opera can overcome the above-mentioned difficulties and immerse the audience in the play, because art is beautiful, and only the beauty of art can give the audience pleasure and regulation, which is in line with the purpose of entertainment. Therefore, Peking Opera audiences will unconsciously hum along to the songs and tunes. When opera fans are indulging in wine and women, they will hum "The Lonely King is Drunk in the Peach Blossom Palace," and answer questions with "That is indeed so." As for the amateur performers who put on makeup and perform, they are completely immersed in the play.</p>
<p>This stylized result allows the actors' skills to be very exquisite and sophisticated. Their signature plays can indeed leave people with endless aftertaste. The beauty of Peking Opera lies here. Now, several self-proclaimed reformers of Peking Opera in Shanghai have discarded these characteristics as if they were worn-out shoes. The facial makeup is gone, the movements are not paid attention to, and the accompaniment of string and wind instruments only has a small gong left. The so-called progress of Peking Opera through their efforts has only resulted in it picking up some of the dregs of spoken drama, adding some mechanical stage settings, sword-wielding heroes and deities, and the open fighting style of street performers, sacrificing the physical appearance in a sensual dance to attract the audience, selling gimmicks, and making money. Calling it Peking Opera is already not Peking Opera. It is extremely naive, pandering to the low-level tastes of clerks and servants, and resembling civilized drama.</p>
<p>The audience of Peking Opera no longer feels its supreme beauty. They want to see the cunning and treacherous manipulations of Jiang Gan. They still return to the old plays to seek satisfaction, even though the old plays have no progress or reform.</p>
<p>I hope that the farsighted gentlemen in the Peking Opera world will recognize the essence and dross of Peking Opera, and make the greatest determination to reform Peking Opera and crown it with the beautiful title of "National Opera."</p>
<h3>Film and Drama News</h3>
<p>Fei has gone to his hometown of Suzhou to write a script. After returning to Shanghai, he is actively preparing for filming. Fei is one of the city councilors, and he has been busy preparing for the filming work, so he has not been able to attend this session of the council. Fei recently went to Suzhou again, not only to escort his mother back to his hometown, but also to shoot exterior scenes in Suzhou.</p>
<p>Wu Yonggang's "Loyal and Brave Family" has been prepared. The budget is being rushed to be made, and costumes and props are being prepared. The staff of China Electric Film Studio II are quite busy. The first set has also begun to be built. The film will be photographed by Xue Boqing, recorded by Tan Heming, and starred by Qin Yi and Liu Qiong. The set will be designed by Li Enjie of the China Repertory Theater.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Drama and Film Joint Company was founded by Shi Dongsha, Ji Zongde, and others. A thick book of plans was printed in Chongqing, and they are currently raising funds and recruiting shareholders.</p>
<p>The second program of the China Electric Film Studio Theater after coming to Shanghai, *Twenty-Four Hours in Chongqing*, has been staged at the Lyceum Theater. The play is a successful work by Shen Fu, with many gags. It was very popular in Chongqing, but the audience in Shanghai is not enthusiastic. The reason may be that the hype in the play is mostly from Chongqing, such as the terms and meanings of "hanging the ball," "air raid shelters," "Jiangnan people," and "Renewal Fortress," which may not be understood by people in Shanghai.</p>
<p>The arrival of American color films in Shanghai has not only broken the terrible record of Shanghai spoken drama, but also made several meaningful literary and drama films produced in the United States during the war, such as *The Rhine Watch*, *The Pied Piper*, and *The Bell of Adano*, have a dismal business.</p>
<p>Wu Yonggang collected a lot of information about life in Shanghai during the occupation when he wrote *Loyal and Brave Family*. There are many interesting details, and the film is sure to give people in Shanghai a high sense of realism when it is finished.</p>
<p>Chen Jingting will be filming a play for China Electric Film Studio II after Wu Yonggang's *Loyal and Brave Family*. The first draft of the script has been completed and is tentatively titled *Distant Love*. It will be starred by famous actor Zhao Dan.</p>
<p>Zhao Dan will also direct a play. Zhao has been revising the script and collecting information extensively out of caution, and is currently engrossed in creating it.</p>
<p>The newsreel work of China Electric Film Studio II (Beijing) is quite tense. Recently, seven more copies have been shipped to Shanghai, including *US-China Cooperation: US Troops in Beijing* and *Reception in Northeast China*.</p>

<h3>Loyal and Brave Family</h3>
<p>— Lang Huan</p>
<p>*Mrs. Miniver* was originally a popular American novel that caused a sensation when it was published. Readers have loved it for a long time.</p>
<p>The story tells of the joys and sorrows and everyday trivialities of a middle-class family in Britain during the outbreak of World War II. Mr. Miniver is in the construction business and lives with his wife in the village of Belham, near London. Their modest income is just enough for them to live a slightly "luxurious" and comfortable life. Life is so peaceful and leisurely.</p>
<p>Mrs. Miniver meets stationmaster Ballard while buying a hat. Ballard wants to use her name to name a flower and enter it in a flower competition, which attracts Miss Beldon. Miniver's eldest son, Wayne, falls in love with Miss Beldon, but at this time, the news of Britain and Germany declaring war suddenly arrives, and the whole village enters a state of war. This is followed by Wayne enlisting in the army, and Mr. Miniver driving a motorboat to rescue British troops retreating from Dunkirk. In these hurried and chaotic events, the wedding of Wayne and Beldon and the grand flower competition are interspersed. Just as the flower competition ends, an air raid alarm suddenly sounds, and the newlywed Miss Beldon unfortunately dies in the air raid.</p>
<p>The whole book tells of some trivial things and depicts some ordinary characters, but the good thing about the whole book is that the events are trivial, but the details are clear and not chaotic; the characters are ordinary, but their personalities are meticulously portrayed, full of the flavor of life. I really like the book *Mrs. Miniver*. I feel that after Austen and Galsworthy, it is rare to use a leisurely tone and pick everyday trivialities to depict the somber personality, rich sense of humor, appreciation of life, and exploration of human relationships of the British middle class. This book is indeed a very successful work. The only difference is that the background of *Mrs. Miniver* is taken from the recent war, which makes the readers feel more intimate and interesting, and at the same time, the war can more clearly reflect the tenacious personality of the British people.</p>
<p>This novel, which is worth recommending, was made into a film by MGM, directed by William Wyler, and starred Greer Garson and Walter Pidgeon. It is now being shown at the Grand Theatre, and the film is renamed *Loyal and Brave Family*.</p>
<p>After watching the film, I felt very satisfied. However, I feel that the success of this film is certainly due to Greer Garson, but the director's choice of the right protagonists is something that cannot be ignored. Greer Garson's somber personality is really perfect for the role of Mrs. Miniver. Walter Pidgeon's acting is very stable, and he is unwilling to let go of even small movements. Teresa Wright's Miss Beldon, Richard Ney's Wayne, and Henry Travers's stationmaster, all perform admirably in the scenes of arguing, dancing, and winning awards.</p>
<p>It is very difficult to please with literary and artistic films. This is partly because after a work is made into a film, after deletions and excerpts, it often loses the original harmony and beauty. It is also partly because in literary and artistic films, even if the protagonist's acting is superb and successful, if the supporting actors cannot grasp the plot even occasionally, it will often destroy the style of the original work. I remember that Greer Garson's acting in *Pride and Prejudice* (Austen's *Pride and Prejudice*) was quite successful, but the performances of Mrs. Bennet and Mr. Collins were too overdone, which made Austen's middle-class British family imbued with the breath of American small-shop women, and the style of the original work was completely lost. Of course, a literary film cannot be too拘泥to the original work, but in a film, if there are too many contradictions and incompatibilities in the national personality and the background of the times and society, it is not very good. I think this may be because of the times, and the actors feel it is more difficult to simulate. However, in the film *Loyal and Brave Family*, because the actors are evenly distributed, the spirit of the original work can be maintained. This is something that the original work can feel happy about.</p>

<h3>Answering Readers' Questions</h3>
<p>Liu Xinqing asks: I have always been physically weak and first contracted a cough six years ago, suffering from multiple illnesses, including wheezing and rapid nasal breathing, and rapid heartbeat (symptoms resembling acute bronchitis). My throat is narrow, leading to difficulty swallowing and frequent choking. An X-ray examination diagnosed "tuberculosis of the lymph nodes on both sides of the pulmonary hilum, clear and normal lung fields, and a normal heart." Currently, my symptoms include a pale complexion and a thin physique. I implore medical experts to provide detailed guidance.</p>
<p>Dr. Yu Xinen answers: I believe it is due to the upper respiratory system being prone to infection. Physical weakness and excessive fatigue can both contribute to this condition. In addition to being especially careful about diet and health during cold and hot weather, it is important to focus on nutrition, such as eating more eggs, pig liver, spinach, and cod liver oil containing large amounts of vitamin A.</p>
<p>Fang Yanqiu asks: Eight years ago, my right ear and face became red and swollen, making eating very difficult. After ten days, it subsided naturally, but I lost hearing in my right ear. Questions: (1) Is the constant buzzing and ringing in my ear like cicadas or bells tinnitus or is my eardrum damaged, making me deaf? (2) If it is tinnitus, are there any economical and simple ways to diagnose and treat it? (3) If my eardrum is broken, will the ringing in my ear still occur?</p>
<p>Dr. Yu Xin answers: The initial illness was likely otitis media and mastoiditis (mastoid bone). The eardrum has either ruptured or thickened, preventing hearing. Medication is unlikely to be effective. You can try the Eustachian tube inflation method at an ear, nose, and throat specialist, but the results cannot be guaranteed.</p>
