<p>〔本報南京廿一日電〕美使館新聞專員康納士，二十一日發表馬歇爾元帥擬於二十三日偕夫人離京，赴津作數日小遊，廿五日或廿六日可歸來，馬帥一九二四至一九二七年曾隨美國第十五步兵隊駐節津門，在該地頗多友好，久已有意舊地重遊，至渠是否在平稍留，尙不可知。</p>
<h3>現任公務人員　不得無故免職</h3>
<p>政院通令各省市遵照</p>
<p>〔中央社本市訊〕事務官不隨政務官進退，此項辦法，爲各國之通例，茲行政院以據內政部，交通部，水利委員會，銓敘部等四機關提請保障現職公務人員案，經決議送銓敘部，於制定保障法是參酌辦理，在保障法未公布前，並請國民政府重申迭次所頒保障事務官之前令，飭各機關切實遵行，如再有違反法令者，並應由監察院提出彈劾，依法懲戒。查公務員保障法未制定前，各機關事務官不隨政務官進退，依法任用之公務員不得無故免職，早經明文規定，行政院業經通令各省市政府，聞是項指令業已到滬，市府奉令後，即於日昨轉飭所屬一體遵照。</p>
<h3>民社黨平津幹部會議　通過參加國大案　惟須政府實施該黨提議</h3>
<p>〔本報北平廿一日電〕民社黨平津高級幹部四十一人，廿一日下午在湯薌銘宅舉行聯席會議，決定贊成參加國大，其重要議案有二：（一）擁護張君勵先生向蔣主席所提之條件，仍在該條件下參加國大。（二）如政府不能實施民社黨所提條件，則民社黨可隨時退出國大。政府方面國大出席人，大多仍希望民社黨能繼續保持第三方面立場，以準備作第二次調處。北平民社黨對參加國大意見，本甚紛歧，但經孫寶剛，葉篤義二氏多方接觸，詳細說明京。滬民社黨員意向後，廿一日乃以卅二對九之多數，通過上列兩議案，惟討論時爭辯仍烈，會議下午三時開始，六時始如此表決。張東蓀廿一日未出席會議，仍堅持其不參加態度，另一中常委梁秋水亦致函該會，聲明個人不參加國大。孫·葉二氏北行任務圓滿達成，將於廿二日晨偕萬仞千飛京，向張君勵報告。廿一日會中，對北方民社黨名額及選舉辦法，尙未作具體決定，廿二日將繼續討論一般意見，希望代表由下面上產生。此外，聞會中有人提及青年黨有代表百名，民社黨較青年黨尤重要，代表亦應擴充，並望此項要求能實現。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿一日電〕民社黨致主席團，業於廿日交政協秘書長雷震轉呈主席，主席覆函尙未送出，據蔣勻田稱：一俟主席覆函到達，即將公布，藉使全國人士明瞭。至該函內容，現尙未悉。又民社黨對於提交國大名單一事，尙待張等抵京後，始能確定。</p>
<h3>侯北人蒯超飛京</h3>
<p>〔本報北平廿一日電〕（一）民社黨要員侯北人，蒯超廿一日飛京。（二）聞蔣主席最短期間可對張君勵提出覆文。（三）北方民社黨員，對民社黨參加國大問題，有舉足輕重之勢，今雖在此種情勢下解決，但張東蓀不參加，對張君勵個人決策仍有影響。</p>
<h3>陳誠李宗仁　傳日內飛平</h3>
<p>〔本報異常巨一日電〕此間咸傳，陳誠總長，李宗仁主任，將於二三日飛京。</p>
<h3>立院改今日開會　審議憲草修正案</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿一日電〕立法院原定二十一日下午四時半開五委會聯席審查會，審議中常會二十日通過送交該院完成立法程序之「中華民國憲法草案修正案」惟因多數立委同時亦爲國大代表，二十一日午後參加國大選舉主席團，未克及時參加，至審查會不足法定人數，乃臨時改二十二日上午九時半舉行。聞按照立法程序，該修正案經聯席審查會通過後，尙須經立院全院會議通過，始完成手續，惟旣爲五委會聯席會議，則各委員若於會中認無須再開全院會議，或亦可作爲已完成立法程序。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿一日電〕中華民國憲法草案修正案，業於廿日中常會通過，此足以表示政府尊重政協決議及實現民主之決心，該案是否能於立法院順利通過一點，若干人頗抱杞憂。記者二十一日訪某權威觀察家，據談：過去中常會或國防會對各種法律僅決定原則，而後交立院起草，此次中常會通過該項修正案，乃國民黨根據政協決議之原則，經過政協憲草審議會政府代表訂正研究，復興民社黨，青年黨，社會賢達人士再度研究始成立訂正稿，故昨提交中常會時，已爲一法案，而非原則，與以往程序不同。按照權力機關稅，中常會，國防會通過法案後，立法院僅完成立法程序，立院對此案縱有所爭論，亦不會有所變更。外間觀察，認爲立院將有何爭端，當不致有此事，此其一。又據悉，中常會討論一小時後，若干委員曾發表不同意見，有主　逐條討論者，有主張先決定原則者，嗣因總裁有所指示，故最後討論結果，認爲該修正案已經過愼重研究，不必有所更動，因即將原案通過提出，此其二。根據以上兩點，立院對於案即使討論，亦不會十分延長時間，可不必顧慮，此項修正案將來提交國大，相信國民黨必能設法使其黨員在國大會議中促其大體通過，在法律觀點上，無論國民黨或國民政府，均不便一定強制國大如何行動，故國大代表對憲法問題如就國家民族利益上有更好意見，當然可以提供。同時照政協決議，有再好意見，亦可提出研究，外傳政府保證可在國大通過一事，亦不確實。</p>

<h3>白部長告本報記者　綏靖區政會開幕　救濟復員經費問題決定</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿一日電〕白部長崇禧告本報記者，綏靖區政務委會，已於廿一日午後閉幕，連日集會結果，對綏靖區之復蘇有關事項，均曾詳加研討，而最主要者爲救濟與復員，其經費問題已決定，原則將由各省就其轄治之綏靖區內情況需要與財政，糧食，水利，衛生各有關部會署會商，確定具體計劃及預算，由中央核定後，迅速撥款，開展工作。</p>
<h3>延安令關內外共軍　準備大規模進攻　松花江畔連日砲聲隆隆</h3>
<p>〔本報天津廿一日電〕此間有關方面頃得密報，延安十八日已下令關內外共　於十二月廿五日前，向國軍作大規模進攻。</p>
<p>〔本報北平廿一日電〕記者自各方獲悉：此　安局面，將再發生劇變。官方稱：共軍正在各地大事調動，有所準備，共方對國軍亦有同樣指摘，惟未來重心究在何處，則其說不一。其觀察家稱：共產黨可能放棄其陝北根據地，而化北滿爲新天地，並謂：延安已開始疏散中　他方冀·魯·晉內在情勢已日現緊張，尤以山西爲最，陝·晉邊境之離石，中陽·臨汾·永和·隰縣一帶，共軍正積極爭奪有利據點。河北之平漢綫北段，經過十八日之雙方各以三萬大軍之大會戰，再呈膠着狀態。</p>
<p>〔本報北平廿一日電〕關係機關息：東北情勢逐漸緊張，各地接觸日見頻繁，林彪提出撤退東北共區小組之要求後，更對此局面投下大刺激。現東北共軍約達廿萬，散布於滿者約十萬，主力分置陶豆油昭及白城子，八天以前，共方即停止其所有客貨運輸，大軍逐漸南下，松花江外，每日砲聲隆隆。</p>
<p>〔合眾社北平廿一日電〕自中共代表團首領周恩來離京返延安後，延安·大連及哈爾濱三處，漸成戰事中心，華北及東北似已開始大規模之作戰準備。軍調總部中共人員，今日續有十人搭機離平，前往延安，留平中共和平代表已減至約三十人。長春及瀋陽電訊紛傳大連及松花江防綫一帶，國軍及共軍調動頻繁。</p>
<p>〔本報瀋陽廿一日電〕東北各地軍調小組由中共代表，廿一日起向長春集中，軍調在東北計有廿七，廿八，廿九，三十，卅三至卅六等八小組，後由鞍山·海龍等地區撤走，在瀋之廿七小組中共代表李初梨，廿一日飛長春，聞將在長待命，如第二次撤退命令到達，中共代表即飛哈爾濱，東北各處共軍備戰忙，國軍亦在作防禦準備，長官部參謀長趙家驤十九日去長春。吉林視察，甫由營盤來瀋之副長官鄭洞國，廿日又去安光，新廿二師將調長春，加強長市防務，李師長濤現鎭守海城。又在共軍區域之軍調小組，計有雙城·齊齊哈爾及拉法前綫等小組，林彪所指不能保障安全者，即係此等地點。</p>
<h3>國大主席團複選花絮　蔣主席獲票最多吳敬恒首先揭曉　戴院長當場暈倒驚動了整個會場</h3>
<p>— 本報記者濮德玠</p>
<p>開會前三分鐘，蔣主席衣戎裝持手杖，偕夫人自左側門步入會場，陳立夫很家閒的跟在後面，但一聽說戴院長昏厥後，忽忽趕到大門口，看看無大碍，回告主席後，才回到自已位子上開會。</p>
<p>白崇禧開會前五分鐘到會，經過曾琦的位子時，兩人歡笑小談，等一一　在第一排自己位子上，又成了新聞記者的鬥爭對象。陳誠則坐在中間的中間，和鄰居們小聲談話，目標不顯著，十分安全。</p>
<p>繆嘉銘銀髮滿頭，帶金絲邊眼鏡，和靄誠懇地和熟悉人打招呼，走到主席台前，和活躍的劉蘅靜小談一會，就安詳的坐在左面第三排的位子上。</p>
<p>戴院長政躬欠佳，入場時即步履無力，由隨從扶進，至開會前，果然支持不住，突然暈迷，立被攙掖出場，登車返邸休息。一時會場小有騷動，記者紛紛往門口探詢。</p>
<p>國民黨代表裏，選出蔣主席作主席團候選人，南京區也一致選了蔣主席，主席的意思由京市重選，但京市的代表們說，首都是全國人士薈萃之地，應選國家領袖，決定不另選，堅請蔣主席爲京區候選人，博得了大鼓掌，經籌備會請示後，蔣主席表示接受，會眾又鼓掌。</p>
<p>爲了邊民參加主席團候選人，貴州少數民族代表楊砥中，首先發難，引起一場激辯，有的說應該依選舉法，不能隨便塡列名字，有的說二千五百萬少數民族，不能沒有參加主席團的機會，有的說堅決反對增列單位，有的說不重視邊疆少數民族要退席，情緒熱烈緊張，結果洪秘長報告貴州代表張道藩，在國民黨代表中已當選，黔區當選的位置放棄，由楊砥中遞補，於是皆大歡喜。主席台左邊豎起了一塊黑板，上寫三個大粉筆字：「楊砥中」，請代表在選舉時更正。</p>
<p>湖少數民族代表石啓貴發言，爭取邊民主席團候選人席位時，話卻沒完，主席頻頻鳴鈴，加上斷電，石方停止，依依地走下發言台。</p>
<p>激辯時，發言極其踴躍，不依秩序的接替了，依秩序者的機會。洪蘭友奉令報告時，一八五五席大聲說：「早就請求發言，爲何不讓發言？」有人回答：「不要發言了」。洪回身詢孫科後說：「還有報告」報告解決了問題，停止了爭執一八五五號也不要發言了。</p>
<p>一位代表質問：「爲何把張繼先生的主席團候選人取銷了？」洪蘭友說：「剛才讀過的，恐怕是這位代表沒聽到」。「不是的，昨天晚報登了，今天日報上卻沒有，剛才又讀出來，何以取銷添上如此隨便？」洪說：「張先生在國民黨和冀區單位都當選，所以放棄了國民黨方面的，籌備會秘書處是不敢隨便增添的，報「上登的新聞，不是官方發佈的，一切應以正式報告爲凖」大家和和氣氣，把理說清，全場暗暗喝采。</p>
<p>代表中兩位大漢，一個是「山東大漢」延國府，一個是塔爾寺的「羅漢」黃正清</p>
<p>政校學生一三六人（其中有兩個女同學）被邀到會作開票員，一律黑棉制服，符號上加佩了綠色職員證，和臨時會場出入證，排隊進場，排隊出場，一聲不響地作事。</p>
<p>下午四時二十分，開始選舉，全體記者被請出場，以便清查人數，一時包廂裏和休息室裏全是記者，有的說，「要不得」。有的說。「事實需要，沒關係」。有的說，「老規矩，參政會也是如此」。</p>
<p>開會前競選活動熱烈。選舉時代表一手拿鋼筆，一手翻幾種不同的名單，伏在小案板上，　　地在選舉票上畫圈，活似小學生考試，一方翻夾帶，一方作選擇題，用功之至。</p>
<p>五時正，記者在休息室裏？茶點吃多了，話講完了耐不住跑出來，剛剛主席夫婦選完了走出會場，邊走邊微笑點頭，「好，好」。後面是一大隊選完的代表，從包廂裏擠下去，會場裏到處是代表。陳立夫和孫科在台上談得很正經，蔣碧薇梳雙髻，穿着紅大衣，提着黑玻璃的皮包，登台去領監選人的佩條，有的代表往外走，有的還坐在位子上。</p>
<p>選舉完畢，記者開始入場。陳立夫首先被包圍，一直談到大會堂門口，五時三刻才突圍登車。會場裏鄂代表鄧玉麟，在抗議爲何不在大會堂公開開票？洪蘭友說：「票子多在大會堂裏不好分組，參政會也是在會場外開票的，好在票匭是封了的，也有監票代表，記者可隨意參觀，還是公開的」</p>
<p>票匭一共十二個，樓上三個，樓下九個，每個前面站一個大會職員，蓋子是大會封條封了的，口兒則由四位開票總負責人簽字嚴封。第一個拿出會場的，是第三號票匭。</p>
<p>開票在二樓會議室，水銀燈雪亮，代表，職員，記者，攝影師，忙碌異常，總負責人吳望伋，楊一峯，陳玉科，蔡金瑛，指揮報告十分賣力，六十個開標員，分作十五組，開票匭後，分別領票，積極工作，先騐票，最先交卷者，第一組，共九十六張，八時一刻騐票完畢，計選出代表一四六七人，發票時一四四六人，棄權者十四人，投票總額一四三三張，內廢票三十四張，旋將有效票一三九九分予各組開始唱票寫票，滿室「票票」之聲，工作至爲緊張。九時一刻第五組最先開出，結果廿二日上午二時一刻第一個產生之主席是吳敬恒，獲八〇二票，獲票最多的是蔣主席，一三七一票，算出來時在座的人一齊鼓掌。</p>
<p>四個開票總負責人在唱票開始時，才輪班吃飯。吳望伋九時站起來去吃飯時說：「吃勿消格事體，斜氣麻煩，餓煞咧，餓煞咧」。</p>
<p>大會新聞組副組長，英俊年青年幹練，熱心助人，下午八時草草吃一碗飯後，就挾着油印新聞稿，到處找記者散發：「你們送來啦」。記者們說：「謝謝，謝謝，你也夠忙了」。</p>
<p>記者在開票前，統計一四六七張票，每票四十六人，共計六七四八二個名字，每名唱時，估計平均費時四秒，需七十五小時，分十五組進行，需五小時，比係最快之速度，結果八時半開票，十時半開票，廿二日時卅五分計算完畢，實際票數較統計雖少六十九張，費時則達六小時餘。</p>
<p>上午二時三十五分開票完畢，忙累已極的工作人員們，和坐候了大半夜的記者羣，精神反見旺盛，將選票封存後，大家說：「呵呀，謝天謝地，了卻一椿大事，趕快睡覺，明天下午三點鐘選要開大會，不得了。」（完）</p>

<p>全國同胞：今日爲第七屆防空節，當此勝利復員方閱一載，乃建國建軍邁進之時，吾人於此節日，舉行紀念，作懲前　後之檢討，淬濿求新，求備止于至善精神。關於防空建設，前途實重且鉅，我國過去以國防力量未臻充實，致遭敵寇侵略，今雖獲致勝利，但爲保障國家，永久安全，維護世界集體利平，對於國防建設，實有積極努力之必要，而防空又爲國防之中心，在戰時則發揮其功能效用，在平時則應有嚴密之訓練，與優良之準備，以厚蓄自衛力量，而建立自強　爕。且自原子能應用以來，防空技術，日毅力改觀，尤宜急趨直追，有所建樹，然後保障安全與維護和平方能見其實效。回憶抗戰期中，敵寇挾其優厚之空軍兵力向我襲擊，人民生命財產備受慘痛犧牲，幸賴我空軍將　興防空人員，艱苦抵抗，各大小都市，亦均有其偵察防護等額組織，得以減少損害，安輯人心，使我們前綫方均能穩定，此種慷慨效忠勇敢赴義之精神，舉世共見，實可嘉尙，今後仍應繼續保持，毋使　廢，庶幾一日有警，應付裕如。惟今後科學進步迅速，萬一世界上觸發戰事，其形式必將迥異從前，其慘烈殘暴從前，其慘烈殘暴，亦必百倍於往昔；吾人不可徒恃消極之防護，必須充實積極性之防空設施，造成堅固國防之中心力量，就目前已有之基礎，配合國家經濟，及國防工業之進步，以求空軍力量之發展，一面努力科學研究，運用最新防衛方法，根本消弭空　損害，庶足以自存於現代國家之林。此外，如何加強民間宣傳，普及防空知識，如何充實防空設備，改進防空組織，使人人咸知　覺，習於曲突徒薪之諜，則更爲政府與國人所應共同努力者也。吾人向以愛好和平自居，且促進世界和平之責，絕不願今後任何國家再摧戰禍，重苦人民；惟國防準備爲一國安全所倚托，亦則鞏固世界和平之保證，吾人必須居安思危，及時規劃周詳，以達完善之鵠的，庶幾有備無患，不致輕爲人侮，此又不僅防空一端，希望國人咸知注意，即整個國防建設，亦應羣策羣力，共同完成者也，願共勉之。</p>

<h3>越南僑胞水深火熱　常遭搶劫官方竟熟視無覩　法越軍衝突時被殺萬餘人</h3>
<p>〔中央廈門廿一日電〕六十萬旅居越南之僑胞，邇來幾全在搶劫恐怖下掙扎茍活。據返此出席南僑經建公司發起人大會之安南中華總商會會長陳肇丞氏稱：越南經濟中心之西貢，市郊附近四十萬華僑，僉視日落爲一可怖象徵，蓋每晚八時後，即普遍展開大規模之武裝洗刧，暴徒輙多至數十百人，于街頭兩端架設機槍，按戶搜掠，毫無忌憚，直至黎明始已。初尙以富有僑胞爲目標，勒索金錢，繼則不論貧富，皆遭同樣命運，甚至家具衣物，亦被搬運一空。越法官方，竟熟視無覩，即使僑胞報警，亦置之不理。陳氏係十月廿七日由越晉京參加全國商聯會，本月十九日飛廈，出席經建公司發起人會。據云：越南圻香市平福市黨　村四起，因法越衝突，輒被法軍縱火焚燒，慘遭屠戮之華僑，達萬餘人，尤其富壽村，係工業區，華僑多營皮革業，近因一法兵被越民殺害而遭大軍包圍，無數僑胞，慘遭杜死，房舍工廠，悉被摧毀，其慘狀實有甚於戰時之淪陷區，故目前越南僑胞，咸盼政府與法方交涉，履行去年十一月間簽訂之中法新約，並保證不再發生同樣事件，賠償華僑損失。</p>

<h3>社論　事實的對照</h3>
<p>自中共代表周恩來返抵延安之後，國共商談即告一段落，政府爲充分表現「盡其在我」的精神起見，一面中國民大會制定一部切實可行的民主憲法而外，並積極進行磋商改組國府及行政院的事宜，中常會與最高國防會議，也已於廿日通過國民政府組織法草案，政府委員會名額定爲四十人，行政院擴大基礎增至三十八部會，各部部長與各會委員長的人選，也已次第內定。政協決議可望全部實現，民主社會黨的參加國民大會，可望不生問題。最近幾天來的政局，似已見開朗，使我們一般渴望和平民主的老百姓，頓覺政局的前途大有希望。但是在中共方面，其良知爲一黨一已的私利所蒙蔽，不知爲國家爲民族的前途，多多打算；而仍在那裏千方百計，發動宣傳攻勢，一方面企圖破壞國民大會完成其制憲的神聖義務；另一方面已異想天開，竟稱國軍進攻延安。欲使不明真相的中外人士發生一種印象，認爲整個中國已爲內戰的黑影所籠罩，而不復有成爲強大的民主的統一的中國之希望。少數的外人，因爲不明中國政治的內幕，或能信以爲真，固然不足託異；但是國內尙有若干報紙，甘心爲中共的宣傳攻勢，舖張揚厲，竟自稱爲「公論」。實在使我們老百姓百思不解。</p>
<p>所謂事實勝於雄辯，我們姑且把政府與中共在最近一月來雙方所作所爲的事實，列舉出來，作一個對照，是非黑白，也就昭然若揭，不言可喻了。政府在一年多來若接若離的商談的過程中，始終抱着忍讓的精神，不惜委曲求全，但是一再委曲，並沒有求到「全」。就是和談到了山窮水盡的時候，政府仍以國家爲重，到處表現「盡其在我」的精神。所有一切的舉動，莫不以民意爲依歸。因爲人民渴望和平，政府就自動的無條件的下令停戰；又因人民企求民主，政府早有還政於民的決心，也就決定召開國民大會，制定一部切實可行的民主憲法，爲我國法治民主奠定一個始基。到了國大開幕的前夕，政府實已至忍無可忍讓無再讓的地步，但因爲第三方面的要求，政府又將會期延後三日。政府不以中共的呌囂笑罵而稍有介意，完全抱着大公無私的胸懷，處理國家大事，光明磊落，實在沒有什麼可以批評與非議的地方。</p>
<p>回頭看看中共，在張家口戰事緊急的時候，口口聲聲，要求和平，大聲疾呼，「無條件傍戰」；到了政府真正下令停戰之後，中共匪特不肯同時下令停戰，而且反對政府頒佈停戰令，甚至利用國軍「扼守原防」的時機，在各綫大舉反攻，河北·山東·遼寧·以至蘇北，戰事的再起，完全由於中共採取攻勢所致。同樣，中共口口聲聲要求民主，在政協會內，亦一再堅決張，召開國民大會制定憲法，並要求改組國府及行政院，俾成立全國一致的聯合政府；但至政府要改組政府要召開國大的時候，中共的論調突然改變，先　國府委員名額多寡以及行使否決權；後來索性拒不提出國大代表名單，以致定於五月五日開幕的國民大會無法如期舉行，新憲法更無從產生；其後政府決定於十一月十二日召開國大，中共始終表示反對，不論政府如何委曲求全，要求中共參加，但由中共態度倔強，在任何條件之下，決不參加。現在國大開幕了，政府仍保留其名額，並盼望其幡然覺悟，隨時提出代表名單，參加國大，但是中共依舊執迷不悟，並千方百計，破壞國大的成功，無所不用其極，在口頭宣傳上，稱國大爲「非法」，宣言不承認未來的憲法；同時在事實上，又阻撓別人參加國大，現在中共更進一步，又向國內外宣傳，說國軍進攻延安了，企圖把和談決裂與戰亂發生的責任，完全推在政府的身上。</p>
<p>要之，我們看了上述事實的對照，可知中共所傳國軍進攻延安之說，除了別有用心的人以外，誰也不會相信的。中共的宣傳攻勢，顯然又要撲「空」；但是我們看了日來中共在陜甘寗邊區的「動調頻繁」，中共雖然自稱爲「疏散」，但也可知中共的宣傳攻勢，又將爲其發動軍事攻勢的先聲。中共這種作風，徒然令人失望，不啻是自絕於國人；我們實在替中共可惜。其實在中共之中，也不乏明達之士，何必一定要出此下策！</p>
<h3>種族平等的倡導</h3>
<p>——埃及提案的通過</p>
<p>隨着法西斯主義的崩潰，優秀民族的理論，已經再不被人重視了。據最近人種學家的研究，世界上的人類在個人方面，固然有聰明和愚策的區分，但是在民族與民族之間，卻沒有優秀和拙劣的差異。據中共社紐約十九日專電，聯合國大會首次舉行五十四國的投票，一致通過埃及提出的決議案，請各國政府立即停止宗敎上及種族上的迫害與歧視。雖然埃及的提案，並沒有列舉事實，貢獻具體的辦法，但是這一個提案的通過，誠如印度代表所說，是「確定人類不問其爲白種人黑種人或黃種人間，完全平等的一大步驟。」</p>
<p>種族旣然沒有優劣，他們就應當享受平等的待遇。假借優秀民族的神話，強凌弱，眾暴寡，這是十九世紀歐洲帝國主義的作風，同時也是法西斯集團的暴政。現在法西斯主義雖然失敗，種族的歧視並沒有完全消滅。如像南非聯邦對於境內的印度人，就有六十種法律，限制他們種種的自由。公共汽車，火車，郵政局，公園，到處都必須與歐洲人分開。二百萬人歐洲人可以選一百五十名議院代表，二十五萬印度人卻只能選三名代表，而且代表必須是歐洲人。又如菲律濱共和國自待成立以來，通過三種關於零售商，勞工，市場攤販三種法案，剝奪華僑生存的機會，而且拒絕　菲華僑入境，軍警隨意逮捕，內政部甚至於有唐人街的計劃。像這類種族歧視的行動，根本違反民主主我的精神。</p>
<p>民主主義的精神，應當是自由，平等，博愛。種族歧視的政策，限制自由，取消平等，根本談不上博愛，南非聯邦和菲律濱共和國因此也就不能算是真正的民主國家。在通過埃及提案的時候，全體一致通過，反對者只有南非聯邦總理史末資一人。史末資最近還向聯合國託管委員會建議，要求兼併西南非，並且宣稱如果聯合國託管委員會不予通過，他要採取直接行動。史末資在南非聯邦不民主的政績和帝國主義者的作風，當然要受全世界與論的指謫和制裁。至於菲律濱代表旣然同意這一個提案，今後對境內的華僑，就不應再施不平等的壓迫，像關於零售商，勞工，市場攤販一類的法案，也儘可不要實施。</p>
<p>歐洲經過長時期的宗教戰爭，到今天宗教上的歧視，早成過去了。但是因爲種族的不同，他們也往往信仰不同的宗教，就是在同一種族之內，宗教也可能有不同的信仰。因爲宗教不同，往往釀成激烈的衝突。這種情形，在印度特別地顯明。印回的衝突，至今死傷數萬，回敎徒領袖加入臨時政府之後，還不能制止各地流血的鬥爭。至於印度人中間，因爲宗教的關係，分爲五個嚴格不同的階級，其中不可接觸的階級，最受人壓迫，永遠沒有翻身的機會。這些宗教的歧視，都是造成印度內部糾紛的主要因素。</p>
<p>中國數千年歷史上，有一點值得我們驕傲的，就是沒有宗教的戰爭。孔家哲學雖然獲得歷代政府的支持，其他的宗教也同時並行不　。至於種族方面，中國的先哲，無論儒釋道都具博愛平等自由的精神，決不主張任何的歧視。過去中國能夠維持龐大的帝國，保存悠久的文化，也全靠這種寬大容忍健全的人生觀和宇宙觀。我國首席代表顧維鈞在聯合國大會，特別引用孔子「四海之內皆兄弟也」的至理名言，當時博得全場鼓掌。月前美國裴斐教授在上海同濟大學演講，亦指出愛因斯坦世界和孔子世界的關係，前一個世界是研究「人與物」，後一個世界是研究「人與人」。依照裴斐教授的看法，今天世界最嚴重的問題，莫過於研究「人與人」的關係。人類必須要和諧相處，必須要有自由平等博愛的精神。埃及代表的提議，是人類正義的呼聲，五十三國一致同意，也是人類和諧相處的預兆。</p>

<h3>風行滬上的標會內幕</h3>
<p>閱報載市參議會警政委員會於本月十六日舉行第四次會議，討論禁止標會一案，參議員對於禁止標會之意見未盡詳明。參議諸公，來自民間，惜對民間疾苦，不無隔膜。須知標會流毒甚於花會，受其害者，盈于累萬，取締之道，焦頭爛額，爲時已晚，曲突徙藉，正當其時，鄙人忝爲小市民之一，亦爲公務員，平時深入民間，見聞較切，謹將本市標會情形臚梗概。此爲數百萬市民公認之事實，千真萬確，希望警政參議諸公當機立斷，爲民除害，漢口張五婆殷鑒不遠，幸勿以危言聳聽而忽之耳。</p>
<p>（一）游惰請會重利盤剝　自從抗戰勝利以後，本市標會之風盛極一時。一般無業游惰應運而生，依仗惡勢，強制請會，自爲會首，將收得會款轉放高利貸（俗稱印子錢）。譬如集會百人，每人於第一次出款十萬元，一百人共爲一千萬元，首會一次收入，後二輕局放他人，每元每月可得利至少三角，最多六角，簡言之，每千萬元，至少可得三百萬元之不法利潤。而標會每月舉行一次，每次祇須付出十萬元，此種無本生意，輕而易舉，是以素來衣食不週之游民，一旦皆變爲暴發戶，席豐厚履，金玉輝煌，無人不羨其生活奢華，不但窮公務員望塵莫及即紳富之家，亦自嘆勿如。</p>
<p>（二）挾款潛逃天良喪盡　標會之風旣盛行一時，大利所在，羣起效尤，你請我會，我請你會，迭爲寶主，連綿不斷，茶樓酒肆，但聽一片標會聲。當局從未加以制止。而標會標款之大，出人意料之外，因游民標得會款，有高利貸可圖，雖出巨標亦頗合算，故每一游民視其能力大小，通扯自做會首，每人至多十餘脚，來別人的會至少數十脚，旣收頭會，又收標會，吸收現款，數字驚人，目的旣達，遂起不良之心，宣佈倒會；若輩旣無恒業，又無恒產，乃盡挾所有，席捲而逃。</p>
<p>（三）良家婦女受害最烈　自漢口張五婆巨騙案發生後，本市游民標會即起動搖，自本年八月份到現在，是凡游惰所結之會，無會不倒，游民之間，互有往來，倒會有賬可抵，最苦的一般小家婦女，平時節衣縮食，甚至借債打會，一旦倒會，畢生心血，盡付東流，你向他要錢，他說銀行尙且關門，店還須打烊，何況區區標會？你報告當局，局員說誰呌你來會的，我們不管。以致被害人哭訴無門，因而悲憤自殺者有之矣。而且此輩游惰，均屬無恥之徒，一見官廳不問，自然更爲胆大，初猶出外避風，後竟出頭露面，你能把他怎樣？他們並將財物藏匿，裝成窮苦樣子，你奈他不得！</p>
<p>（四）急則治標嚴懲會首　「殺人償命，欠債還錢，」古有名言，於今不廢。流氓利用惡勢力，詐欺取財，重利盤剝，不用拚命，劫得巨款，其手段毒辣，實較明火執杖之強盜更爲利害！禁止標會，祇能防患於未然。現在，接受人民告發，將流氓會首立即拘案，依強盜罪盡法嚴懲，並令其交出藏匿財物，賠償被害人。一面嚴禁標會，庶幾標本兼施（正當市民因週轉不靈，不得已請會者當屬例外）。如果只討論禁標會，而於例會則置諸不問，旣已墮甑不顧，何必亡羊補牢。故目前治標，實爲急不容緩。</p>
<p>末了警政當局，參議員諸公先生們，請你們大發慈悲，以雷霆萬鈞之力，從強徒的手中奪回民眾的財物？（市民許五）</p>
<h3>一幕老父被殺悲劇</h3>
<p>我是一個蘇北泰縣五區顧高鎮。自從匪共盤據後，家裏弄得山窮水盡，今年五月間又把全部田財分光，家中的人逃往親眷家去避難，（我本服務松江縣中心學校校長之職，後因妻子逃難，無法維持生計，故來上海担任民校。）今天得到一個可怕的消息說：匪共將我忠懦的五十歲的父親無名義的槍殺了！我的父親顧桂林，是鄉里中人大家公認的老實人，財產分光了不算，還要槍殺我父親，共匪如此政策，喪盡了天良，敬請將此實際情形刊登，以伸血冤。（顧汝波）</p>

<p>〔法國新聞社大西洋城二十日電〕關於美政府對於礦工聯會主席路易斯所採取之態度，頃據美勞工會主席格林加以評論稱，政府即使以槍剌或拘禁恫嚇工人，亦不能使礦工生產煤斤一噸，任何企圖凡欲運用武力以對付礦工者，徒足以引起勞工聯會所屬其他工會同情罷工而已。政府未將目下之糾紛交勞工部或仲裁局解決，殊屬失檢云。按美國工業組織大會業已宣布該會所屬各工會，誓爲礦工後盾，美國兩大勞工團體已携手合作，協力支持路易斯，以粉碎政府防止煤礦工潮之企圖，可於此見之。據消息靈通人士談稱，美政府與各工會奮鬥到底，業已開始。</p>
<h3>國外駐軍問題重提　美代表納利詞鋒犀利　駁覆莫洛托夫所發演說</h3>
<p>〔路透社紐約成功湖廿一日電〕英外相貝文可望於今日在聯大政治委會中答覆莫洛托夫昨日所提調查國外駐軍之要求。美代表團發言人謂，美國雖願報告國外駐軍數字，但並不包括海空軍駐軍數字在內，但英國與美國均認如果軍事參謀委會需要情報，則此項情報應包括國外所有駐軍包括　地在內之報告。</p>
<p>〔路透社紐約成功湖廿日電〕蘇外長莫洛托夫今日突然出現聯大政治委會，發表關於軍隊駐在非敵國境內事之意見。渠指出若干情形下，外國軍隊駐在非敵國境內，乃干涉該國內政之方法。渠認爲盟軍不應駐在盟國，除非有維持交通之必要時始可。渠更指出蘇軍雖已退出中國，挪威，南斯拉夫及伊朗，而英美隊尙留在歐洲，亞洲及南美之非敵國境內。莫氏繼乃建議由聯大會請安理會，轉請聯合國各會員國，於一個月內提出下列報告（一）會員國在何處非敵國領土內，駐有幾許軍隊，（二）會員國在何處前敵國境內，駐有幾許軍隊，（三）會員國前此及最近建立之　地及海軍防地設在何處。莫洛托夫稱，波蘭境遇人尙有少數蘇軍，乃用以維持對德交通綫者，至於朝鮮北部之蘇軍，則係根據與盟邦所訂協定而駐在，反觀英美軍隊，於戰爭久已結束以後，仍駐在歐亞及南美各處，其空軍基地更密佈世界各處，而若干國家對於兩極尤感特別興趣。蘇政府於八日間即向安事會建議，令各會員國提出軍隊駐在非敵國土地內之報告，蘇聯願意履行此項義務，希望他國亦能同意，以謀世界共同之利益。</p>
<p>美代表康納利繼起發言，鄭重否認美軍駐在他國業已引起不安。並聲明美國駐在國外之軍隊，戰爭結束時有五百萬人，現已減少至八十萬人。康氏與莫洛托夫僅兩椅兩椅之隔，康　利於結束其演說時，猛力　桌而言曰：「吾人願使世界知我國之軍隊駐在何處，因爲不論我軍駐在何處，並無威脅世界和平之處。彼等所携者爲促成和平團結協議以　國際福利之白旗」。康納利並要求調查駐軍，應包括世界全部之軍隊，渠謂携有刺刀之兵士，不論其在本國土地或外國土地均足　成對和平之威脅。最後英代表買德幹發表意見稱，余認爲蘇聯代表所提出之決議案，僅以駐在國外之武裝軍隊爲限，實據不足，故余主張設立一參謀委員會，俾搜集對於此項問題，所有一切情報。</p>

<h3>希北陲激戰未已　游擊隊顯受外國支持</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社紐約廿一日電〕希臘駐美情報員昨夜發表該國政府關於邊界衝突情形之正式報告，略謂，自本年九月九日至十一月十九日，希臘領土共受游擊隊襲擊卅三次，此種侵略行動，爲不宣而戰，且危害和平。游擊暴徒係來自南保兩國與阿爾巴尼亞。或且得各該政府之默許。</p>
<p>〔路透社雅典二十日電〕權威方面稱：希臘政府，擬依據聯合國憲章第十四條，直接可向聯大會申訴外國之干涉希臘內戰，不擬於事先向南斯拉夫。保加利亞或阿爾巴尼亞直接交涉。據悉，希境作亂之叛軍，係來自希南交界處之林亞倫區，彼等昨日又侵入馬其頓之某村。史克拉區激戰猶未已，在該處督戰之希第三軍司令范都利斯將軍，已令希臘邊境各哨站，尤其是杜亞倫區，增設大砲隊，防止來自該方面之新攻勢。</p>
<p>南斯拉夫聲明闢謠</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敦二十日電〕南斯拉夫官方通訊社今日鄭重否認，希臘叛軍係以南斯拉夫爲根據地之挑戰性謠言。貝爾格勒特電台稱，希臘人士受其官方之授意，對南國發動謠言攻勢，擬將希國內由法西斯份子所造成局勢之責任，移諸南斯拉夫，貝爾格勒特電台復稱，希遊擊軍在其所佔領之地，已設立人民統治機構。</p>

<h3>日本賠償調查報告　鮑萊兩項附帶聲明　實際情形須待執行機關調整　勞工賠償反覆賠償均所反對</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓廿日電〕今日據國務院消息：日本賠償調查專員鮑萊向杜魯門總統所提出之最後報告書，現仍在白宮方面審查中。據稱，鮑萊曾於報告中聲明數點：（一）調查使命係在決定日本賠償之方針，調查團人員爲履行此種使命起見，僅注重搜集有關日本經濟廣大各類之情報，並從其與賠償最有關係者加以研究。此種財產目錄及其記錄，或由日方直接供給，或由麥帥總部供給。在細則方面尙未加覆核，故一旦付之實行，則與全面賠償之實際情形，中間不免發生若干不能銜接之問題，此則須待賠償執行機關負責調整。例如決定日本解除軍備及全面賠償兩事爲原則，惟無相當輸入之接濟，俾繼續製造貨物以供輸出，則日本工業必不能活動。在決定賠償政策時，固可預先加以安排，惟欲巨細不遺，加以預先規定，則屬難能。關於此層，日後必須飭令日本方面詳盡呈報，如有虛報隱匿等情，則予以相當處罰。（二）鮑萊反對勞工賠償及反覆賠償，蓋以要求賠償各國，本身已勞工過剩，日本如再送出工人，則亞洲各國急須提高之勞工及生活程度，必將大受影響。至於反覆賠償勢必先發展日本工業，養肥母鷄，然後可以絡續取蛋。如此則賠償絡續付清之後，日本即可保留過剩工業，改作軍用及競爭國外市場，威脅鄰國之工業化，養　貽患，危險殊甚，亟宜預防云。</p>
<h3>日土地改革　昨日實施</h3>
<p>全國佃農五之一　可以耕者其田</p>
<p>〔改造社東京廿一日電〕日本土地改革法今日開始實行，麥帥總部土地問題專家耶金斯基特發表談話稱：日政府曾於本年三月十五日向總部提出農地改革方案，因有下列各項缺點，致遭駁斥，（一）因地主得保有五町步（一二·二五英畝），未免過多，將使原有佃農耕地百分之六十不受影響，（二）對過高地租，未有對抗辦法；（三）規定實施期間爲五年，實嫌太長，且無此必要；（四）改革之實施，委諸地方官應辦理，難免不徧袒地主之利益，而發生不公平之事。但此次修正之改革法大有進步，殊足爲減輕日農民多年之貧困與不安之遠大措置。農地所有權，將見廣泛分配，日本佃農能有五分之一可以耕者有其田，對違法行爲，已有周密切防止之法。</p>

<h3>「無空防即無國防」　昨防空節紀念大會中　黨政軍首長致詞警惕　殉難空軍家屬　欲言無語神傷</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨日爲第七屆防空節，上午九時正，鳴空襲警報，同時防空節紀念會假大光明大戲院舉行，由　國楨·宣鐵吾·方治·曹俊·谷春帆·祝平·李熙謀·徐采丞·王繩善等爲主席團，到防空列職同志家屬，死難同胞家屬，各機關代表，及來賓等約千餘人。由吳市長主席略稱：今日在此地舉行防空節，覺得感慨良深，回憶在重慶任內，目睹敵機猛烈轟炸，憤懣已極，深覺欲保衛領土，必須有強大之空軍。祖國經此長期消耗戰後，元氣未復，擴充空軍，自非一朝一夕所能達到，故吾人至少應準備消極之防空。上海地處海濱，人口擁擠，萬一遇到空襲時，必將不堪設想，爲未雨綢繆計，今後本市建築，須配合防空設施，如興築地道等，故此時此地，紀念防空節，應特別提醒市民，所謂「居安思危」，「有備無患」，我人必須加強防空之注意及警覺。繼由方治致詞，略稱：近代各國科學發達，國際距離愈形縮短，我國抗戰八年中，遭敵機轟炸，損失慘重，始知空防之重要，「無空防即無國防」。現戰事雖告結束，但爲自衛計，亦必須加以注意。後由　吾致詞，謂第一次世界大戰後，空軍已被充分利用，抑且突飛猛進，前轟炸琉璜島及長崎之威力，即爲而證。故要談國防，必先談空防，在侵略者未絕跡前，誰都不能担保世界上即無戰事，幫增強空防實刻不容緩。末由空軍補給司令王衛民氏發表三點：（一）市民須接受防空訓練。（二）對於空防的工具，使用須有充分的常識。（三）市民須接受組織之訓練，空防組織必須嚴密。大會於十一時許，奏樂而散。</p>
<p>又空軍烈士家屬張瑞芝女士，於大會閉幕時，要求陳述意見，旋因觸景傷情未果。會後由吳市長，宣司令等茶點招待在滬廿四位抗戰空軍殉難家屬，當由空軍烈士家屬提出：（一）子女教育費，（二）居住問題。（三）生活維持費。（四）烈士靈柩無法運回原籍，上項意見，均由吳市長允予召集有關機關會商，報請空軍司令部撫恤。關於大會各方面徵集之慰勞物品，刻正由地方協會徵集中，一俟收齊，當逕送各殉難烈士家屬。又空軍供應司令部，爲發揚航空建國增進人民航空常識起見，特於外灘，大世界，卡德路靜安寺前四處，各置一百公斤重炸彈一枚，供市民參觀。上午九時半，航委會並派機在市空散發防空傳單。</p>

<h3>美商人對新貿易感　能否見效須視能否遵守辦法　希望扶助出口商</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕記者頃訪本市美籍出口業權威人士，詢以對政府近頒修正貿易辦法之觀感，承談：該項辦法，原則上固甚健全。特別在撙節中國外匯之一點上，尤屬必要。惟該項辦法，能否切實有效，實須視各人能否遵守辦法。設該項辦法能以不偏不倚之精神付諸實施，則對中國之經濟，必將有穩定之因素也。今試舉數端以明之。過去正當進口商行，無不穩健經營業務。然投機者以享有同樣之進口權利，對各項進口貨物，莫不善價而沽。此事尤以汽車及奶粉等貨品爲最顯著。正當之進口商行，雖以分配限額關係，然對各種進口貨，無不維持其最低之價格，以求維持目前最低之營業開支。然投機者所開之售價，往往三數倍於合理之經售價格。如修正後之貿易辦法，對進口貨不能僅限分配於穩健之進口商行，則類此情事，仍將層出不窮。</p>
<p>然新辦法殆已將出口商全盤置諸腦後。中國目前應鼓勵出口。出口商現因國內成本高昂，無法在出口事業上獲利。政府尤應對穩健之出口商，計劃協助。出口商售貨所得之外匯，須依官司匯結予政府，而結售每元美匯之實得，僅合美金七角五分。而本市法幣之購買力，則純以其黑市價格爲凖。故黑市與官匯價格之相差，無形中使出口商結售之價值，損失百分之廿五。此項損失，勢必由海外之購買者負担。致出口貨成本，又無形增加。欲求有利，安可得之。現查本市大部出口商，均已陷於半停頓狀態中，職員已裁減至最低數。若干穩健之出口商，且已完全停止營業。設當局允許穩健之出口商，能就其結售予指定銀行之外匯，輸入同價值之進口貨，則助莫大矣。此舉可有兩重意義：（一）出口商仍能從進口所得，以維營業。（二）在若干情形中，出口商之出口事業，雖告虧蝕，惟仍勉力願繼續經營，以望自進口方面所約之盈利，以抵銷此出口之虧損也。</p>

<h3>拆除要道凸出房屋案　工務局另擬變通辦法</h3>
<p>前參議會工務委員會，建議市府工務局，將中區交通要道中瓶頸形道路旁之房屋拆除，以利交通一事，業已月餘，惟工務局鑒於此舉，雖有利於行人，而對屋主實爲莫大之損害，在百廢待舉之目前，應有精詳之考慮，故始終未便輕舉妄動。據悉該局對於此事，因係參議會交辦者，爲不違民意機關意旨起見，仍擬照辦。惟現擬定凡在瓶頸形道路旁之建築屋年逾二十年者，拆除一部份，保留一部分。居住或營業者可將伸出之部份拆除。如在二十年內所建新屋，或拆除後無餘地居住者，均暫行保留。是項建議，將送參議會工務委員會核准後再施行。</p>
<h3>美方開始提回血漿　近四萬單位分存於十九堆棧　將仍以藥品償還立達貿易行</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕血漿問題於前日圓滿解決後，堆藏於立達國際貿易行各處倉庫之存貨，已於昨日下午開始由美方前往提取收回。記者曾於下午一時許，驅車赴天主堂街瑞豐堆棧巡視，見有美海軍二十餘人及巨型卡車數輛，停歇於籬笆內空場中。須臾美物資清理委會安德遜中校，新聞發佈組許密德，及美總領事署代表，美海軍代表，立達貿易行負責人等，相繼到來。血漿堆存於四樓倉庫，由該行僱小工八人搬運下樓，然後由美海軍裝上卡車。血漿包裝，外形爲一長方形紙箱，體積二，六立方呎，毛重七十三磅，匣上印有「正常人體血漿，乾裝十二包」等字樣。</p>
<p>在此堆棧內者，共二百十八箱，每箱計五百CC之單位十二包，共爲二千六百餘單位。全部由安德遜中校在收據上簽字收訖，裝上卡車，駛往海軍倉庫存放。然後再繼續至立達行其他堆棧提取。</p>
<p>據立達貿易行負責人稱，棧存血漿共計三萬九千餘單位，分存於十九倉庫。故昨日半日內美方恐尙未能全部提清。至於作爲償付代價之實物，大抵亦爲藥品之類，將由美方開列品名單後，由該行選擇。</p>
<h3>繼血漿發現麻醉劑　在市出售亦正澈查</h3>
<p>據美剩餘物資清理委員會昨發佈消息稱：「關於以血漿誤作剩餘醫藥物資，售與中國商人事，頃據本會調查結果，其中尙雜有醫藥用之麻醉品在內，查麻醉品之售賣，即屬醫藥上之需要，亦須受相當之限制，故正對此事進行澈查，並將採取必要之適當措置。同時本會業以此事，知照美海軍曁總領事館，經美總領事館轉咨中國當局，現由國當局正採取適當行動」。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕全國保險商業聯合會理事長羅北辰，近曾爲保險單黏貼印花問題，晉京向財政部直接稅署及參事廳有所請示。承語記者：目前保險單之貼花問題，厥唯課稅重複。就保險單言，我國保險單及契約，均照比例課稅辦法黏貼印花，實屬重複，現請求將保險單按普通契約貼花，而保險費收據，則按比例課稅辦法貼花，以示公允。次就再保險單據言，以原始承保人，已將印花一筆貼足，如再保險單據再行貼花，則更嚴重複。他如有期限性之保險，實應按日計算貼花。不定期運輸險之保單，應照十五天的期限貼花（因照保險業平均估計，國內各運輸綫所耗之日期，大多在十五日以內），然通常以貼足一年爲期，故期限短促之保險業務保費收入，往往不敷貼花之用。以上數端，如能予以改進，於政府應得之稅收，並無虧損，而於保險業方面，則除去一「　窮之累」。聞財部當局，對羅氏所提各點，認爲不無相當理由，允予考慮改正云。</p>
<h3>聯總職員走私漏稅案　法院應否受理之解釋</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本月初有聯總職員開依，由菲列賓來滬之輪上帶來大批貨物，企圖走私漏稅，被警局拘解地檢處。唯地院鑒於我國與聯總訂立之基本協定中，曾載明「聯總職員於執行公務時，對於其職務範圍內之行爲，豁免任何方式之法律傳訊手續」。且本年十月十七日聯總真茹機器廠總經理海斯被控掘佔墳地，本市地院根據協定曾予不受理之判決，故地院對開依走私漏稅案是否受理，曾向司法行政部請示。昨日司法行政部之解釋訓令，業已到達，關於此案作二點指示：（一）聯總職員之犯罪，除係由職務上之行爲外，不能享有治外法權。（二）國二十五年七月四日國府公布之懲治偷漏關稅暫行條例已不適用，關於走私漏稅事應以海關緝私條例處理。如案情合懲治貪汚條例第一條，第三條第一款之規定，法院仍得受理。</p>

<h3>火災季節話消防　上海設備堪稱全國第一　日夜戒備動作敏捷　半分鐘內全體出發</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕火，這神秘的東西，是一切動力的動力。沒有它，小至個人的飲食起居，大至一國的工業建設，都會變成不可能。自上古時代，燧人氏發明了「火」，就替人們帶來了不可估計的利益和幫助，但是火的災患，也隨着來了。「星星之火，可以燎原。」且別輕視了那一星的火，它可以燬一家，燬一村，燬一城。可以使億兆萬的財產於頃刻之間化爲烏有，可以使成千成萬的人羣流離失所。</p>
<p>住在都市裏的人們，每天在新聞紙上，看到盜警綁案，祇間某家被刦去了多少珍寶財物，某人化了幾十萬美金贖票，就以爲損失的數字可觀，敦知火警的損失，才真可怕呢！依據當局的統計，自去年接收到現在，各種刑事案件，包括竊盜，綁架，刦掠種種犯罪在內，其損失爲二十餘億元，而火警的損失，竟有三十餘億元，超出約三分之一！</p>
<p>再說，盜刦偷竊，物質依舊存在，但火災會燬滅了物質的。平時我們祇知道警察是保護我們生命財產的，豈知消防隊更佔着重要的地位，因爲唯有它，才有了火的「消」滅與「防」止，使火的威力大爲減少。</p>
<p>世界最早有消防隊的，是英京倫敦。遠在十九世紀初葉，幾家保險公司爲了防止投保火險的客戶受火災損失起見，在公司內附設了一個小小的消防組織。這是消防隊的嚆矢。後來倫敦大火，市政當局怵於前車之鑑，才由公家籌組消防隊。而這時候，世界各國鑒於消防隊的重要，都紛紛組織起來了。</p>
<p>我國最初有消防隊，始於京師警察廳，後來各地亦相繼成立。但限於技術與經費，與國外的消防組織相比，猶如初生之嬰兒。比較粗具規模的，要推現在上海市警察局的消防隊，它在中國首屈一指，是全國的模範。記者爲了要明瞭其由詳細的組織情形，特地向該處第二科葉科長，作了一次訪問。</p>
<p>火警控制室</p>
<p>上海一地，總計有消防隊七處，而以河南路口的最爲完善。本市一切火警發生後，立即由火警控制室轉達到各消防處。火警控制室在市政府大廈二層樓，有二個人日夜在那兒工作。他們每一分鐘，每一秒鐘，坐守在一五一八三號電話機前面，隨時隨刻準備爲人們服役。他們所唯一期望的，是當不幸的人們，慌張地求助於消防隊的時候，希望他們還能夠保持最後的鎭靜，務必把失火的路名，及交叉路口，房屋號碼等詳細報告。假如失火地點是在公寓中，更須把那一層樓，幾號房間等報告清楚。最理想的，是把建築的種類，如樓房，平房，商店，廠家等分別陳報。這對於消防隊的工作，如救火車輛的分配等，都有莫大的幫助。直接地可使火場早獲搶救。</p>
<p>時刻準備出發</p>
<p>消防員的生活，在普通的人看來，無疑地是緊張非凡的。他們終日躭在消防處，無時無刻不凖備出發，只要警鈴一響，在三十秒鐘以內，就可以全體出動。假如火警是在深夜，他們便立時從床上跳起來，跨出窗口，緣着銅柱滑落到樓下。因爲他們的宿舍在樓上，爲了節省走樓梯的時間，每個窗口都有根銅柱，每個訓練有素的消防員都能賴此上下自如消防員的衣服，都放在救火車上，所以他們都是坐到車上才穿衣服的。</p>
<p>多數起於疏忽</p>
<p>火災固然可怕，但是它卻是可以預防的。因爲多數的火災，都是出之於人們的疏忽。要預防火災，必先知火災道是如何發生的。</p>
<p>失火的最大原因，不外下列三類：（一）人爲的過失由於懶惰與忽略，平日不注意，不謹慎。（二）人爲的故意——蓄意詐騙報仇，間諜等，故意縱炎。（三）自發的燃燒——由於日斜時的陽光，機器的磨擦，雷電等因素，易燃物料自行起火。</p>
<p>除了（二）（三）兩類外，大多數的火災，由於人們的疏忽。</p>
<p>冬天是「火災的季節」。立冬一過，天氣漸漸冷了，氣候變得乾燥，風勢也會更大。家家戶戶都生火取暖，起火的機會也就更多。但是讓記者再重複一遍「火災」是可以預防的，只要平時小心謹慎！</p>
<h3>虞洽卿靈柩明日抵滬　後日上午舉行大出喪</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕鎮海旅滬耆紳，三北輪埠公司主人虞洽卿氏，在抗戰時內，逝世於陪都，現將靈柩運回上海，由該公司派瑞泰輪至宜昌迎運，該輪戰靈柩於六日自宜昌下駛，至漢後曾受各團體公祭，並舉殯一次。至十四日始離漢，經九江蕪湖南京各地，均有公祭儀式。茲悉該運柩輪昨日下午一時過鎮江東下，昨晚即在江陰拋泊，今晨起椗開滬，約傍晚抵吳淞口，在淞口拋泊一宵後明午進口，預計明日（廿三）下午二時停靠十三號碼頭，三北公司各級職員屆時將前往碼頭迎接，當晚先在船上公祭。靈柩在船再留一宵，定二十四日晨八時發引，下午二時十團體公祭，並開追悼會。據籌備處消息：收到各界輓聯軸幛等不下千餘件，舉殯時由各團體贈送儀仗，發行路綫因寗波同鄉會備有隆重路祭，故略有變更。即靈柩於八時由輪起岸後，經南京路朝西，至勞合路向北，芝罘路朝西，西藏路向南，經同鄉會一直向南，至西藏南路林森東路，折入民國路至四明公所，外灘十三號碼頭，昨已搭建迎殯彩牌樓</p>
<h3>洽老一生</h3>
<p>〔本報特寫〕虞洽卿的靈柩從陪都運滬，將於明天進口了。</p>
<p>對於這一位海上聞人，上海市差不多婦孺皆曉。在虞洽卿晚年的時候，一般人尊稱他爲「洽老」，背地裏有些喜歡說笑的，則還是呌他「阿德哥」，不過這「阿德哥」的稱謂，亦並非含有不敬的成份，相反地，似乎更有些親熱的意味。實在說來，虞洽卿一生的事業，的確是很值得令人欽佩的。</p>
<p>虞洽卿原籍浙江鎮海縣龍山鄉，因爲龍山　鎮海慈谿餘姚三縣之北，所以又稱爲三北。他像許多著名人物一樣，也是出身貧寒。在十五歲的時候，就到上海進一家顏料號做學徒。這一家顏料號自從虞氏進門以後，居然營業日盛，獲利纍纍。後來旁人穿　附會，竟盛傳這樣一個神話。</p>
<p>赤足財神學徒開始</p>
<p>據說顏料店老闆在虞洽卿進店的前夜，曾夢見位赤足財神送進元寶。第二天虞氏進店，剛巧大雨淋漓，他恐怕鞋子浸濕，因此脫了拿大手裏，赤足進門，卻不慎朝天跌了一交。但店老闆非但不予見怪，反認爲是夢兆應騐，「活元寶」進門，因此竟對他大加優待，而虞氏也就從此步步高升，飛黃騰達。</p>
<p>其實虞氏成功的因素，恐怕還在於他的勤勉與好學。他當時一方面做學徒，一方面則進夜校補習英文，所以從二十六歲起就脫離顏料行，先後担任幾個外商銀行的買辦，漸漸地奠定了經濟基礎。</p>
<p>他雖然做買辦，卻不像一般買辦階級的唯知獻媚外人，剝削同胞。他爲人熱心，有眼光，有民族意思。當時上海曾先後發生過幾椿與外國人起糾紛的轟動事件，都靠虞洽卿盡了很大的力量替國人爭回不少的光榮與權益。</p>
<p>力與外人爭取權益</p>
<p>第一件事是光緒廿四年法國人派兵想侵佔四明人公所塚地，因此眞起全市甬人的憤慨而罷市，選延半年之久，後來終於經虞洽卿等奔走折衝，使法公董局放棄了原來的企圖。</p>
<p>光緒三十一年，西曆一九〇四年，上海又發生了一椿所謂「大鬧公堂」的大事。起因在於當時會審公呇的承審官金鞏伯與陪審官英國副領事德衛門，爲了一個販賣人口嫌疑婦女犯的覊押問題而起的爭執，當時金鞏伯判令暫覊於女押所，而德衛門卻主張判囚女西牢。值堂的西捕頭對於金的判令非但抗不奉命，反將公堂大門關閉，持棍竟欲向金行凶。旁聽的人都大爲不服，風聲傳出去，各界咸抱不平，就釀成罷市風潮，有些無知識的更因激於義憤，竟有圍焚巡捕房之舉。因此遭租界當局大批拘捕，而全世界巡捕亦一律罷崗，紛亂情形得未曾有。當時滿清官員交涉毫無結果，祇有敦請四位紳商出來調解，虞洽卿就是其中之一。但是其餘三人，不久竟半途因難而退，獨有虞氏還是不折不撓不亢不卑的與工部局爭持磋議，終於使英方屈服，履行撤去德衛門陪審官職務，向中國官廳道歉，撤懲侮辱華官之捕頭，開釋被捕平民等條件以後，方始由虞洽卿與當時道台及會審公堂正會審官三人沿南京路挨戶勸令各商店開市，同時中西巡捕也一律復崗，一場風波始告平息。</p>
<p>除此之外，他發起華商公會以爭取華人市政權，辦理華商體操會以爲華人爭取自衛權。前者後來獲得了工部局華董的名額，後者則成立了日後萬國商團的中華隊。</p>
<p>北伐成功功不可沒</p>
<p>對於北伐的成功虞洽卿亦有不沒之功。當時革命軍進兵江浙，虞氏曾鉅款接濟，並與黨人組織物品交換所，以經濟上盡了很大的助力。</p>
<p>他個人的事業亦蒸蒸日上，四明銀行與寗紹公司雖在外商勢力壓迫之下，終賴他的毅力，慘淡經營，規模漸具。後來並獨資創設三北公司，積極發展航業，他本人則擔任市商會銀行公會地方協會等等的會長理事長等職，隱然執上海金融界航業界的權威。</p>
<p>抗戰中期，虞洽卿離滬赴內地，當時社會上對他曾有許多不利的傳說。這件事的真相如何當然沒有人敢確言，不過無論如何，虞洽卿以一個七十餘歲的老翁能夠在崇山峻嶺的內地繼續從事商業活動，替政府盡了不少流通物資的力量，這一種精神至少還是令人感動，因此在他的遺體運返上海的時候，我們還是感到無限的追悼之忱的。</p>

<h3>汪柱臣侵占敵產　地檢處提起公訴　被告所述不情不實無可憑信</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕汪桂臣侵占敵長爲烏洋行汽車材料嫌疑案，自清查團移送地檢處，業近二月，現經偵查終結，提起公訴。起訴書原文如下：汪柱臣，男，二十八歲，揚州人，住成都路順天邨一二二號，現在押。被告原爲吾國空軍機械工程師，任空運上校廠長，勝利前一年冬季，以奔父喪來滬，長居海上，始則在家修理買賣舊自由車爲生，繼復與錢子秋朱清雲等夥設孚中公司於川弓路，專做汽車生意（勝利後），並設寫字間於百老匯路廿五路，旋雙歸被告一人獨做，其後被告有留德同學閻惠元回國，又與閻及其　夫余偉合資開設新友公司，由余之介紹，認識前淞滬</p>
<p>警備司令　李及蘭，乃遷新友公司於北海寗路二號原長島洋行內，自願爲淞滬警備司令部特約修理汽車　，與該部修理車輛，不取工資，材料則由該部自備，或委託代購（見特約辦法第三項），其修理車輛槪憑該部交通處之通知。（見特約辦法第五項），在該北海寗路二號廠內原存有長島遺留物資（詳見長接收物資清冊），上年八月一日起，撥告將物資</p>
<p>擅自移動　一部份，寄售於俄人Roseublum羅仁伯奧多汽車公司內，一部寄存於武定路中央機器廠，經武天祥同接收處理敵僞物資工作清查團密告移送偵查到處。訊據被告承認將物資移出屬實，但稱報告上數量不符，並稱此項物資舊車及修理後，餘下另件係屬警備司令部撥給</p>
<p>免費修理　之代價，故其遷出物資，均爲其得自由處分之物，並稱我們唯一之證據即警備司令部之特約云云。是本案被告是否有侵占嫌疑，要以該項物資所有權是否屬於被告以爲斷。查證據第十二號被告所提出者，爲特約辦法七點，並非雙方簽訂之特約，其呈請核准施行該辦法又無批示足資參考，證據第四號至第八號，除第六號有「察看舊</p>
<p>汽車機件　估計修理工程」這樣外，均未能看出除修理警備部舊車後之剩餘材料均撥給被告之記載，被告方面對於修理該部二十輛車子用去多少材料，遷入海寗路　房時接收多少材料，及該部撥給舊車幾輛，均無明確之記載及計算，經函警備司令部調卷查閱，亦除將海寗路房屋作爲特約軍用汽車廠外，其餘均</p>
<p>無案可稽　被告之所提證人俞恩彪到庭陳述，對於被告僅爲同學關係，長島之事一無所知，不能證明支云。警備司令部交通處處長李謹彪備函證明，據稱前淞滬警備司令部向該廠修理之車，前後計算有福特轎車（號碼一五〇四二）一輛，小福特轎車一輛，其中克雷斯納轎車一輛，且奉准發還業主蘇柴林，修理費</p>
<p>二百餘萬　元已照付清，以修理三數車輛必無給予巨量（五卡車）材料之代價等語。則被告所述，其問不情不實，無可　信，顯有刑法第三百十五條第二項侵占罪嫌（至劉仲利告發應　漢余清鑑等　　汪柱臣侵占之敵資卅五年偵甲字第四二〇一號有案本件應毋庸議）爰依刑事訴訟法第二百三十條提起公訴，檢察官郁　新。</p>

<h3>地下錢莊　兩家已被查封　若干省銀行設處　手續不合</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市取締高利貸之工作，現正強進行中。社局現已查出外埠錢莊數家，在本市擅設通訊處，高利放款，業經按其情節輕重，分別處理，其中兩家，已被查封。據有關人士語記者：經營高利貸者，花樣繁多，有假用商店名義者，亦有毫無名義，僅在房間內設一電話營業才。以利息而論，目前約爲大二分。現因商業不景氣，吃倒賬者日多，黑市上亦往往採抵押放款之方式。此次財部及社局取締高利貸，具有決心，方法上則爲嚴密檢查銀錢業之賬目，加以詳細分析，蓋以察知非法放款者之活動，二爲鼓　舉發，因「地下錢莊」之存在，對於正當之銀錢業，深有妨害，甚盼正當商人，能當仁不讓，予以舉發。銀錢業間之同行拆息，高至一角六分五，此亦足以助長黑市高利貸之風。又社局近查明有若干省之省銀行，在本市設立辦事處，辦理放款業務，手續不合，現正由各辦事處分別向各省銀行當局請示辦法。</p>

<p>郭涵青問　敝人於民國廿六年一月向某甲租地一方，訂期十年，戰爭期間，敝人未考慮原約，將該地轉租某乙，訂期至卅六年底終止，計超過原租期十一個月，將來不免發生糾紛，請問：（一）我是否應負刑法第335條侵佔罪與第339條詐欺背信罪？（二）倘原主籍詞勒索，如何應付？</p>
<p>〔奏聯奎律師答〕　行爲人所應負之責任，有民事刑事之別。其在民事法上應負責任者，未必皆有刑事責任，所稱以租地轉租他人，未顧及原約，若確係事實，並不構成侵占詐欺背信等罪，（二）解決之法，可請出租人延長租期，或請轉承承大縮短租期，條件如何，須待談判而定。</p>
<p>（二）發還股款</p>
<p>鄔元富問　鄙人於民國三十三年五月間向某錢莊授資三萬元（僞幣），計三百股，該莊所領者爲僞方執照，自勝利後宣告清理。近忽接通知信囑往某會計事各務所憑　發還股款，該莊作價一千萬元，由經理通過，茲有法律問題原則，祈賜答覆：（一）該莊創立時開股東大會，議決一切事項　在解數時是否亦須　股東大會通過（二）該莊由　　　以三　以上之價值辦法，未知合法否？（三）該莊經理以交　手續　　　監，暫時發　零星　　，　下保持　　名下整數股權，以維將來發展，邇同舞弊，未知合法否？（四）該莊索負　譽，亦非　產，供　是項比例發還股款，是否合法？</p>
<p>〔秦　奎律師答〕（一）經敵僞核准設立之商　金融機關，經政府命令清理，毋庸再經股東會決議解散。（二）出發時，如盤與他人，事實上確能得到較多之代價，而係故以較低之代價　興經理，則可認爲違法。（三）如何　弊，須有　　　明，如果屬實，自係違法。（四）經敵核准設立之商營金融機關，不問信譽如何，一律均須清理，若敵　　　業，則在沒收之列。</p>

<h3>債市平淡</h3>
<p>公債昨仍乏特變，除丁種外，餘者並無新買助威續稍閑散，統丙晨開一三七〇元，大戶！源仁昌等有納，自一三五〇元逐漸回升至一四二〇元以上，五樓某戶有售，近午仍屈居一四〇〇元以下，結果較前收微挫而已，甲乙平，統丁升而統戊跌五十元，成交的五百萬元。</p>
<h3>煙煤市勢步緊</h3>
<p>煤市烟煤因產區冬季已屆，生產低落，煤荒嚴重，黑市飛升，消息抵滬，目前滬市燃管會雖仍設法維持，然因來貨不多供應困難，廠方州戶羣起備購，致市况更趨緊俏，尤以烟煤層爲甚，行市疊升。</p>
<p>煤球業原料廿五日撥發</p>
<p>燃管會對本市機製煤球工業，本月份第三期配售原料煤，業定二十五日起撥發，又本月份各廠申請配煤，已於昨日結束，至下月份需要煤觔於昨日起，由各公會派代表申請治辦，不作個別解決。</p>
<p>關於越南煤觔運華，最近燃管會方面正與越當局繼續洽商中，聞越方須以物資交換方式辦理故進行較爲　　，年內恐不能來華</p>
<h3>到貨絡繹　米價續疲</h3>
<p>米市到源湧吒，南北市共到一萬六千餘石，市化轉懈，南粳續跌二千餘元，北粳亦小千飲元，秈米高貨尚定，巾次帶軟，杜秈亦下降一二千元，交易頗少，白元挫一二千元，陰元降二千元，麵粉銷路　　，廠方供應　　，勢難生色，雜牌粉節節下游，再小一二百元，小麥平平，赤豆去化不濃，回小千元，生仁外埠本街均少成交，續跌二三千元，後形仍　外銷爲轉移，黃豆交易多寥，豆餅平正，花生餅開出三千餘担，均爲南洋香蕉樹肥料去路，油市生油貨稀堅挺，豆油市價平平，惟蔴油則供多於求，受主稀少，狂跌三五千元。</p>
<h3>紗市停頓　黑市買賣發覺充公　四次配貨粗紗太多</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨日紗業市塲，仍極閑散，到會人數不多，互相談天，無交易可談，似在期待各廠之配售，市塲內有吳市長佈告，略謂爲鼓勵檢舉黑市買賣起見，一經查實，貨物充公，提半數酬賞檢舉人，因此塲外買賣，更見絕跡，各紗號已處於無形停業中矣。　棉紗複製業配紗委員會第三期第四次棉紗分配，已於昨日商定，所配紗數，仍由紡建及六區棉紡織公會撥給，共計五，五三五件，與過去數次相近，惟仍是粗紗過多，細紗不足，其十支粗紗，因屢次　額，由複配會向紡管會，及六區紡織公會，要求减少，並要求改配他種支數，而本次十次以下之紗爲九二六件，反較前數次大爲增加，二十支及四十二支大路貨則感不足，複配會對此，表示困難，其繳款期間，爲本月廿五六七三一日，以前各决間有因繳款不及，致被軋出者，　本次正在趕辦之中，小廠拚單之轉由公會彙繳者，因手續較繁，谷該公會催促尤嚴云。</p>
<h3>聨配處繼續配售　油價漸次穩定</h3>
<p>〔本報訊」食油連日下跌，昨日反動　堅。谷擋食油，曾一度漲近議價限度。上海食油聯配處，昨續領到各民營廠配油五百担。計大有餘豆油六十担，菜油一百担，大昌新豆油一百担，大德新菜油八十祖，長德豆油六十五担，順餘豆油六十担，大生菜油二十担，爲民豆油十五担。該項食油，分配中區零售店一百四十二家。又昨”中頗權物油廠　出生菜油二千担，中國食油公司搬出生油三千担，交由食油聯配處配售，以平油價云。</p>
<h3>黑市油十六七萬　社會局派員澈查</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕河南中路信大生油號，出售黑市食油，生油進價十四萬三千元，售價十七萬元。豆油進價十一萬元，售價十六萬元。市府據報，令飭社會局查辦，該局已派吳視察前往查賬。</p>
<h3>道德油廠聲明</h3>
<p>本報昨載「黑市油二千元之中央社消息一則，內稱社會局昨查獲本市菜市街道德油號黑市售油發票一紙，開價每斤達二千元」等語，據費席珍律師來函稱，該號從未出售黑市油，上項消息，絕非事實云云。特爲更正。</p>
<h3>金市漲風突起　外幣連帶回升　香港金價猛漲</h3>
<p>烚赤昨央行管制稍懈，買戶興奮而復起漲風，晨開二五〇萬五，即有爭買，逐漸向榮，惟初時尚形平和，十時後央行尚以二五一萬二五之價，配給二〇〇條，入後央行即無供給，於是十時半後人心大俏，形成爭買，近午漲到二五八萬以上，始有央行供給千餘條，午刻在二五六萬五左右徘徊，午後人心仍向榮而，隔日交割再升至二五八萬以上，始被迫後退，結果較前收漲起六萬七，飾金升爲念七萬二，紋銀平銀元回降，暗息仍在一角二至一角半之間。　外幣受金價刺激，急切回升，美鈔暗市巾自四四〇〇元買價起，逐步盤漲，午刻已昻至四七〇〇元以上，午後微回，結果較前收漲起二百元，港票自九一〇元扳高至九三〇元有求，結果亦漲二十元，港匯升爲九一〇元至九三〇元，印匯一一一〇元至一一三〇元，英匯一五〇〇〇元有售，交易以港匯居多，餘均岑寂，美匯依然呆滯。　香港金價昨午後因謠傳墨西哥有提高金價之訊，猛漲至每兩三三〇元（港幣）收市。</p>
<h3>日繭如不來華　年底絲廠全停　日本確有餘繭堪資交換</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕日繭運華事，各方仍在努力中，目前除對日代表團與麥帥總部繼續折衝外，絲廠業公會已電致顧大使維鈞，請就近與美政府交涉。此次褚輔成赴京參加國大時，亦將與有關當局洽商，促早日解決。有關人士稱：江浙區絲廠大小的九十家，僱用工人兩萬餘。目前一部份工廠之停工，乃受高利貸之壓迫所致，並非由於原料問題。但日繭如不能遝華，則至十二月底時，各廠均將被迫停工。中蠶公司現掌握之繭，爲數不過九千担，現正計劃配出四千祖，仍爲杯水車薪，無濟於事，因一萬一千部紡車，如全部開工，一天可以用盡也。回憶我國與盟軍總部交涉之初，總部之拒絕我國要求其理由有二，一爲我國缺乏「多條車」，故絲之品質較劣，不合美國需要；二爲華絲在美售價過高，不及日絲便宜。其後日本政府忽又補充一點，即日繭須全部自用，並無多餘可以運華，實則日本戰時損失機器甚多，確有餘繭可供我國使用。目前我國所要求者，爲易貨而非賠償；實則民國二十六年間，僅江浙兩省被日人取去之繭，即有二十六萬担之多，即要求賠償，亦屬合理。今日絲廠之原料問題，唯有運來日繭方可解決，因世界上其他之產絲國家，目前均無餘繭可以出售也。</p>
<h3>進出口業集會討論　限額分配問題</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市進出口業公會前日召開理事會，議決先對進口許可制度之各項規定，詳加研究，再由各理事分別提出詳細意見，於本星期六再行集會商討。新進出口辦法中，有兩點須請求管理委員會加以解釋：一爲限額將如何分配，條文中未有明確之規定，公會希望能參加一部份意見，藉使主管機關能更明瞭實際情形，使分配能趨於合理公平。决爲對於審核進口之規定，如審核許可時，央行是否供給外匯，原條文中亦未有規定。有關人士推測今後做進出口業不易，因從事是業者須有一定之資歷，同時必需專業；進口因種種管制，更形困難，將來之發展勢必注重出口。但出口業亦困難重重，例如產品成本過高，運輸工具之缺乏等等。關於在十七日前在美訂購之商品，管理委員會曾規定只有上船待運者方可請得准許，但据可靠方面消息，尺度可能放寬，即凡得央行核准購買之貨物，大致均可進口。</p>
<h3>茶市腳地虛軟</h3>
<p>洋莊茶市，自一部份被頭寸箍緊之貨主傾吐後，形勢遂頻轉軟化，售價方面，初仍穩定，嗣以陳中祁門每担竟跌至十三萬五千元，其他各茶，脚地俱亟虛浮，交易均不暢盛，紅綠茶內銷，悉鮮蟬聯，過程呆定不變。</p>
<h3>轉口呢絨續到　國貨前途危險</h3>
<p>呢絨毛貨趨勢，日來始終平平，蓋高利貸不打倒，百業均將無法維持，現今大小賣買明雖略卜微利，暗中莫不受拆息之消耗而虧本，英國呢絨由香港轉口，日本呢絨由美國輪船裝運各埠，邇來先後到申，因開價較之國產本廠貨爲便宜，故行銷頗不弱，國產呢絨前受美貨壓迫，現又受轉口貨之打擊，再加貨物稅之抽征而抬高成本，長此以往，恐廠與商雙方均有覆滅之危險。</p>
<h3>美棉續跌</h3>
<p>〔聯合社紐約二十日電〕今日棉價稍跌，交易平　。收　時，棉花期貨較上日跌一元三角五分至二元二角五分不等。又新奧林斯廿日電，今日棉花期貨跌二元二角至三元一角不等。</p>
<h3>美麥創新高價　本埠供應形勢綏和</h3>
<p>據麵粉業某鉅子稱：麵粉原料，目下因隴海路及蘇北等地時有運到，同時麵粉產銷量，近月來亦比較减少，故原料問題，已趨緩和，華北用粉，除由當地出產供應外，，餘均由糧食部就滬錫等地裝運往濟，至於訂購洋麥，廠商本身無此力量，且美加等國，對小麥之出口限制極嚴，事先並須得其政府當局之同意，故廠商對洋麥之來華，並不十分重視。</p>
<p>〔聯合社支加哥廿日電〕今日小麥價格，創二十六年來之高峯，小麥現款交易每美斗達二元二角五分。此乃一九二〇年以來之最高價。</p>
<h3>工商業不景氣　昨有四家清理</h3>
<p>工商業不景氣日趨深刻化，工商界倒閉歇業者時有所聞，昨日本市又有英達染織廠，信大棗廠，一　藥行，中國商輪公司等宣告停業淸理，據悉：不久尚有大批商行可能倒閉云</p>
<h3>美國絲價看低</h3>
<p>〔聯合社紐約二十日電〕自十月份政府拍賣日絲，將價格較前抑低每磅七角五分以後，預料美國絲價將繼續下跌。按十月份生絲拍賣價，已接近公定之最低價矣。</p>
<h3>華股市況起落不定　成交額創新紀錄　午後場內空頭益見活躍</h3>
<p>華股昨第二期選交上塲，人心仍感忐忑，市况乍起乍落，極多掙扎，晨開各股均見高，趁高有隔夜空方掉期，多方亦有了結，不久即起跌風，此際因現遞相差甚微，套利者無法活動，間有反套賣買，七六號二二九號一九九號一七六號陸續傾售，逐步下降，十時十五分後經一五一號二二六號八三號有納，而告回升，惟三八號一九八號有售，尚費掙扎，十一時光景，金鈔急騰，買風遂起，二二六號進遞永紗，二三三號七六號進現永紗，三三號進信和，於是各股均急漲到高價，此後現遞價拔開較遠，引起套利活動，經一八六號二〇七號等套賣下，不久又平，近午七六號二二九號等有供，檯面多頭爭斬，形勢再疲，而以低價結束，較前收計，新光小漲，永紗美亞信和景福新光勤興各跌少許迄半成，永公尚平，華豐因遞交上塲，成交熟鬧，獨告小漲，冷股除新亞麗安微升，餘者微挫，午後塲內幾全被放空交易所獨佔市價在交易淸稀下再遭壓落，現永紗退至五五二元賣盤新低價後，始多掙扎，結果較前收計，永紗美亞跌百分之三，景福跌半成强，勤興小一成弱，新光平，而華豐微升，永公亦平，冷股新亞麗安榮嫂尚平，內衣慘跌一成，餘者微挫，全日總成交額計三一二三萬股。創新紀錄，塲外各股平定無變。</p>
<p>外股昨成盤局，上塲時略見小秀，怡紗曾升至七千元外，惟難持久，結果較前收計航業怡啤會德豐尚平，餘均微漲。</p>

<h3>教育部一再呈請　追加教育復員費　行政院先後核發四百億</h3>
<p>〔本報南京二十一日電〕教部前以全國教育復員，因交通旅運　頓，物價隨時代高漲照原定預算　　經費，事實上　用不敷甚鉅，呈請行政院追加復員經費一千二百億元，政院以經費浩大，迄未照原呈核准，惟全國敎育復員，國立各機關學校，或旅運在途，或修建待款，情勢迫切，刻不容緩，各機關各學校當局環請教部救濟，敎部據情迭向政院籲請，在上月中及本月初，先後兩次，每次由政院撥發一百億元，教部因已往爲救濟各校臨時急需，預爲籌墊，至行政院兩次所發經費到部，分別淸償墊款，下餘經費，撥發各校，已屬車薪杯水。現在復員國立專科以上各學校，雖多已旅運復員，而因水陸空三方面所用旅運費，超出過多，於敎部具領或借支續發經費，仍不敷歸還，前爲迫切旅運而挪借之款，及各校修建費，因物價工料之漲，或不能完工，或亟待修建，皆紛請敎部照各校呈請追加預算，如數早日核發，敎部一再轉向政院陳情，請核定前呈一千二百億之追加經費案，聞政院現允再撥二百億，以爲教育復員救濟之用。敎部俟接到正式公文，再辦領款手續，然後按照各級敎育復員實際所需，核發經費，並發國立各校復員追加經費。政院此後有不再發追加經費之說，如果屬實，則前後四百億，合原來敎部呈請一千二百億之數，僅及三分之一。</p>
<h3>留日華僑　創辦技術學校</h3>

<h3>婦女留美　今日開始申請</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕美國大學婦女協會，爲資助各解放國婦女留美，入高等學府進修一年，訓練婦女在社會上領導工作，特舉辦國際奬學金。中國各地婦女均可向當地美國新聞處申請。本市各大學畢業女生及職業婦女，連日前往漢彌登大厦美新聞處二〇五號文化聯絡部申請者，極爲踴躍。申請日期於十二月十五日截止。</p>
<p>惟該會以獎學金名額有限，故審核頗爲嚴格，申請人須先向該處索取申請書詳細填明，於二十二日下午三時起，申請人須親自前往該處，由美新聞處上海分處代理處長葛恩女士面試及格後，轉送南京該處文化專員費惠梅女士作最後審核。錄取以後，視各人經濟能力發給獎金，故並不相同。錄取人員中，如能負担一部分費用，則錄取名額可望增加。</p>
<p>該會對於申請人資格最注重者，爲其過去服務經歷，英文會話及寫作程度。又學業完畢後必須返國服務，華僑藉此機會僑居美國者不得申請。</p>

<p>市黨部方主委亦蒞塲觀戰，黑白以沈仁壽，李金造，林子儀，葉克熙許因珍臨陣，生化秦循則趕到，乃與劉景行唐寳堃任前鋒，而以李震中王南珍任衛。黑白葉克熙罰球開紀錄，劉景行一托破籃，沈仁壽立刻回敬，南珍一罰各三平手，黑白許因珍林子儀二中紅心，　　　射建功，成五與七，第一節終了，　軍以十五對十一領前。第二節生化以張少卿　　善代出劉景行秦　則，黑白亦以傅永信蔡金典代出李金造林子儀，雙方相持五分鐘，未增紀錄，黑白郭國業人調蔡金與，黑白罰球得點，生化　景行重新入場，連建二功，沈仁壽破籃，前半結束，黑白十九，生化十五。</p>
<p>生化窮追不獲</p>
<p>易籃之後，黑白蔡金典先中，生化秦循則依樣葫蘆，生化大調人馬，張少卿劉福善王鏡湖替出秦循則唐寳堃李震中，黑白葉克熙一擲，蔡金典一托，沈仁壽冷飯命中，一氣連得六分，三節完畢，黑白以廿八對十八佔先五球。末節生化李震　唐寳堃再行參戰，果然大見轉機，追至廿西對廿八，黑白呌停，生化仍緊迫不捨，造成廿七對卅及廿九對卅二之接近局面，黑白沈仁壽罰中，即採拖延戰略，迨鐘聲響處，黑白以卅三對廿九克生化，造成來滬第二度勝利。</p>

<h3>國軍出關一年間</h3>
<p>— 本報東北特派員韓清濤</p>
<p>十六日瀋陽航訊　　「軍人們都渴望着賢真正的和平，如果做到這地步，我也願脫下二尺半，換穿長布衫！」</p>
<p>·杜韋明將軍語·</p>
<p>杜將軍單明，本會統率國軍小關，接收東北主權和維護東北地方治安，他的參謀長趙家驤，幫助他運籌帷幄，到了十一月十六日，治洽是毫一個年頭了。在這十個年頭裏，南從山海關起，北至松花江止，西邊到了熟河，東邊進至鴨綠江邊，東北人人腦際裏有個杜長官的影子?「五十二軍，十三軍，新六軍，新一軍，七十一軍，九十三軍，六十軍……從去年起，陸績的開進東北來，現在，這些軍隊，雖然有的己經轉到了別的地方，可是都給東北民眾，留下了深刻的印象。</p>
<p>國軍收僅了一個城市，杜將軍就要親身去視察，山海關外到瀋陽間的各域市，撫敞，四平街，長春，承德，張家口。赤峯……，都去過了，安東收復了，他又去看過一次，他在懸掛着的：「歡迎譽滿西南威震東北的杜將軍」大輻紅布標語下·走進了安東，安東人民夾道歡迎，朝鮮人也揮動着八卦旗織。</p>
<p>杜將軍走進了安東，他傷感着工廠的破壤，軫念着人民的疾苦，所以征塵甫卸，就自己駕着軍子，走到商號住戶去訪問，去慰藉，老百姓都用着感激的臉色和語調，陳述着過去的疾苦。</p>
<p>安東的人民，把「清算」和「鬥爭」倆個名詞，不斷的向遠來這裏的人們講述着，好像訴冤般告訴大家那是怎麼一回事，一家叫做「大昌染廠」的，魷能清算去偽滿帶三千萬，此外被清算百萬和幾十萬的真不知道有多少呢，有幾位地方人士，他把「鬥爭」比做是演悲慘滑稽劇。</p>
<p>不忍卒睹的破壞</p>
<p>安支市鎮江山麓，排列着幾排綠頂黃磚西式小樓房，也有的是鮮紅亮瓦或是磁磚鑲成的別墅，遠遠的望去，的確相當的美麗，走到近前，看來也考究，可是門窗沒有了，走進去，擺在眼前的情景，是磁質盥洗盆打碎了，磁馬桶倒了下來，地板掀起了，明氣搬了家，牆上寫滿了紅藍墨水的標語，什麼；「中央軍弟兄們，不要替×××打仗了，你們的妻子兒女等待着你們呢」！此外，那真是五花八門，罵，勸，譏諷，還加上了一些小調，地上散遺着「東北民主聯軍遼東軍區政治部」印刷的傳單和畫圖。</p>
<p>我們出入了許多精緻的小房屋，樓上樓下，都是一樣的情景，破毀伴着凄涼，大家好像憑吊戰場般的離開了，幾所院落裏的綠松和鮮血般的紅葉，則在拱托着動亂和破壞後的風光。</p>
<p>車站，空洞，荒涼，橋頭半面懸空的月台，整個推翻了，一兩個舊車頭，燒着木柴，嘶啞的吼着。據說好的機關車，都被共軍拖過了江岸，換了一些彈藥來，新義州江岸，排列着許多船隻，岸上堆積着許多物質，老百姓指着說：「那是我們這邊的東西！」</p>
<p>過去，安樂有一個兵工廠，已經被破壞的看不清輪廓了。三大造紙棧中「鴨綠江」和「安東」造紙廠，機器被共軍搬走一部份，然後放把火燒了，這給瀋陽報業一大打擊。因爲大家都希望安東造紙廠，給瀋陽報業解決大部份紙張缺乏的困難呢，現在剩下私營的「六合成」造紙廠，現有的機器，僅能製造一些祭祀用的冥紙了。</p>
<p>四家舫織廠，僅僅剩下了空房，橡皮廠三家，祗「東亞」工廠破壞較輕，有短期內復工希望。至輕金屬工業，汽軍廠，水泥，化學和鍊綱等廠，據老百姓說，己早被蘇軍搬走，這些工廠裏，以汽車廠規模最大，過去，每日可出車百廿輛，現在，一切都完了，安東工業經過兩次浩刦，已經弄成不可收拾。</p>
<p>雙刀戰衛·機動用兵　急行軍日行一百廿里</p>
<p>這次收復安東的國軍，是在東北打硬仗的五十二軍，軍畏趙公武，操着廣東的官話說：「我們的政治要進步，因爲現在政治配合不上軍事，」他又說：「共軍的區公所，縣政府，都走在軍隊前頭，我們的政治工作人員，卻落在了大後，此後似乎應常多用些青年人，免得遇了事縮手縮腳。」</p>
<p>五十二軍的第二師，改成新二軍了，軍長劉玉章，述說摩天嶺戰役，他描述共軍的如何死守，國軍如何裸胸　爬立壁，致雙方都有很大的犧牲，國軍班長熊其老，以頭顫和肉身，堵擋共軍射擊火口，慘痛的犧牲，換得了國軍的最後勝利。</p>
<p>趙軍長和劉軍長率領國軍進兵安東造成了快速的新紀錄。據說：五十二軍各師，原駐紥中畏路南段鞍山一帶，十月十八日下午三時，接獲命令，連夜集中。十九日由鞍山出發，二十日開始遭遇共軍，且戰且進，廿一日經過一天戰鬥，攻下摩天嶺，廿二日繼續前進，每天以一百二十里的急行軍，於廿五日下午四點半鐘，到達了安東，六百多里的路程，算起來，除了作戰兩天多，那只有四天多在趕路，所以安東人民說是「神兵天降」！</p>
<p>杜將軍說：一年來，用「雙刀戰術」，分割了林彪的一口袋戰術」，運用了機動用兵，對抗了毛澤東的「一點兩面厭」，而共軍的便衣在先擾亂，然後利用老百姓衛鋒，而以軍隊殿後，依次前進的「三三制戰術」，國軍用了專對最後軍隊的穗紥穩打辦法，得到了最好的效果，東北一年間的戰事，在這次主席下了令國停戰令後，應該不再打了，杜將軍說：「軍人們都渴望着真正的和平，如果做到這個地步，我也願脫下二尺半，換穿上長布衫。</p>
<p>建設東北新天地</p>
<p>杜將軍爲了建設東北，教育東北子弟，特聯合各界人士，創立了一所「中正大學」，和平區裏，原來的日本女中，「興亞會館」，「康隆閣」，以及其他損壞的櫻房，都已建修起來，從南一條罵路口，到了南五條馬路口，橫佔兩條街，極爲雄壯，教授陣容，也極可觀，將來發展，實無限量，年來演成紛亂局面的東北學子，多在這裏安定的沐着春風化雨了。</p>
<p>瀋陽的日本神社，過去在東北是很有名的。每天到那裏虔誠致敬的日本男女，來往不絕，同時，每天所收入的佈施也不在少數。八?－五光復後，突然冷落下來，空曠整齊的地方，駐紮着一些軍隊，這樣的經過了一年。</p>
<p>杜將軍爲了剷除這種作爲日本侵略東北勝利的代表物，把它改建了「陣亡將士紀念祠」，大家習見的日本神社門前洋灰牌坊，　去了最上面的模樣，成了一個很好的代表我們國慶的雙十字大牌坊，院內的殿堂，改油上了紅漆，裏面供上了牌位，頂端繪上了國　，所有敵僞殘蹟，均盡可能的加以改修，於是守全改觀了。蒼松古殿，幽靜整潔，實爲英靈久眠的佳境。</p>
<p>十一月十六，國軍出關週年紀念日，舉行忠烈祠落成典禮，瀋陽各界，於是日擴大勞軍，并向行轅熊主任斌，杜長官聿明，彭將軍璧生，余主任紀忠獻旗，此外有宗教文化十餘團體，特默黑絨大幕，懸掛祠內，表示感受國軍英靈，并禱東北早日和平。</p>
<p>停戰令下了。國大召開了，中原，東北，都在顯露着和平的　光，不能再有內亂了，不能再破壞了，爲了國家興亡，爲了我們的生存，人民一致的要求，大家共同來撲滅關東已經一年多撲不滅的野火，好得建設東北新天地！</p>

<h3>新任暹羅駐華大使乃沙洗·杜拉叻</h3>
<p>— 本報旅行記肥者黃潔蓀</p>
<p>六日曼谷航訊</p>
<p>「中國和暹儸，兩國人決酷似得幾難辨別，血統上的關係尤不可分，你隨便的問街道上所見的暹羅人，他們會告訴你，他們的祖父或是曾祖父都是中國人。」</p>
<p>暹羅的國務院長曾經和我這麼說。說這些話的國務院長，他本身也正是中國人的兒子。我們得概括的說，暹羅的位居顯要者，都是華僑的後裔。最近被任爲駐華大使的乃沙洗。杜拉田叻（Sanguan　Tularak）他的父親也是中國人。如果根據中國的國寫法，他們都是中國的公民呢。</p>
<p>乃沙浣曾經參加六·二四政變，這不流血革命軍成功後，在披耶拍鳳，鑾披汶政府期間，都做過高級官吏，但無籍　名。到了太平洋戰爭爆發，日軍進佔暹羅，他逃出日軍的黨握，潛往重慶，繼到美國，英國，以自由泰的名義，奔走呼號，和我國朝野人士，多有交往，始漸漸聞名於世。戰後在暹羅，他是教育部的助理，兼任戰犯檢查團的主席，位置雖然不高，但在選羅的政治舞台上，他是受着注目的一個人。</p>
<p>戰徒的暹羅，無論是在政治上，經濟上以至軍事方面，處處受制於人，同時，並且有着法兵的侵犯邊境，真是四顧茫茫，呼救無門，不少有識之士，便都傾向於中國。乃沙浣可以說是其中的領導者。這次美國和英國繼着法國向暹羅提出新要求之後，同時向暹羅致送通牒，主張暹羅交還四府土地，這於暹羅的排華論者是一種重大的教訓，一般國民也明白了中國的善意。連到昔日素以排華親英着稱的乃比里也首先專程訪問我國了。乃沙浣如果能夠好好的有所作爲，在未來的邊羅政治舞台上，無疑的，他將成爲一個舉足輕重的紅員。</p>
<p>在暹羅，乃沙浣所交往的，多是我國僑商和駐在暹羅的各方面的工作人員，我和他也常常見面。完全是中國人的容貌，完全是中國人的氣概。當他的駐華大使一職經我國的同意而正式發表之後，我問他，對此有什麼感想，仙率直的說：</p>
<p>「我很偷快。這就是給我以從事促進中邊兩國的更深的諒解和聯繫的最好的機會了。」</p>
<p>他的太太和一子一女，都在重慶住過一年多，他的女兒說得一口很流利的國語，她也用國語興奮的對我說：</p>
<p>「爸爸到南京去，我和媽媽不久也要去。——我喜歡中國。」</p>
<p>乃沙浣現年四十四歲；夫人四十二歲。女二十歲；子十八歲，己於兩個月前赴美求學。他的父親張良生方於數年前逝世，他的家中還高高的懸掛着他的父親八十二歲生日的時候族人們致送的金色大壽字及其一首壽聯：桃花已發三層浪，人瑞先徵五色雲。</p>
<p>乃沙浣定於本月中旬啟程到南京去。對於他，我們不能像對其他的國家一般的，單純的以爲他是畢國的一個使節，我們應該視他是流寓在外方的中國的子孫，新從異國歸來！</p>
<p>同時，我們也得知道，暹羅對於中國，有深厚的期望。我們應該給她以扶助，給她以眷顧，使她長成，使她強大。——這是我們中國的一種工作，也是我們中國應該肩負的一種責任。</p>

<h3>合肥三荒</h3>
<p>— 本報駐皖記者白萍</p>
<p>十六日訊</p>
<p>秋深了，生活在合肥的人們，已親切地感到初冬的意味，你瞧，包公河紅裳翠蓋，娕藕鮮蓮，如今只是一泓秋水，景色蕭條；至於逍遙津，除掉衰草落葉，陪伴着一池死水，再也沒有什麼。大街上，行人寒衣初試，已經顯得朦朧，到晚來，不過九點鐘，商店紛紛關門，呌你　索行路，這深秋的季節，合肥比夏天蕭瑟多了！</p>
<p>復員歸來的人漸增，各縣公務人員因公來省者川流不息，雖然道兒已成今日安徽政治中心，但古老情調，依舊不減往年，不論住在這兒或是經過這裏的人，只要在京滬一帶呆過的，同樣體會到生活上的空虛，同時看見今天合肥有三大荒：這便是房屋荒，娛樂荒，燃料荒。</p>
<p>房屋荒　踏破芒鞋也難尋</p>
<p>合肥在日寇的魔掌中曾度過八年苦難的歲月，八年，時間應該算是夠悠久的，敵人在這裏，壞，沒有建設，再加上地水摸魚折變磚瓦木石材料，還有淪陷前經過幾度轟炸，到去年勝利後省府由立煌遷來時，合肥城區房屋僅餘下二分之一了，這賸餘的半數房屋，多是東倒西歪，難避風雨，經過一年多的時間，雖有補舊建新，終於供不應求，形成了今日嚴重的房屋問題。</p>
<p>首先感到威脅的便是公務員眷屬難於安排，他們前後託朋友，講人情，結果只得到幾間破爛不堪的小屋，這還是去年情形，這半年來若想覓租房子，會呌你有「踏破芒鞋無覓處」之感了。記者在這裏穿過了不少大街小巷，眼見每個住戶都擠塞得滿滿的，就是政府最早承租光桿公務員所住的宿舍，也是床床相連，和輪船上的統艙沒有兩樣，再說，這兒重要人員也有因爲房子難找而只好不帶眷屬來，省黨部主委劉真如先生，財政廳長濮孟九先生，都在這裏成了光桿公務員，各和他們的同事住在一起。爲了住房子這裏有一個笑話，濮孟九先生來皖接長財政廳時，接租前任桂廳長所住的房子，誰知房樂想加價，擱在門口不讓濮先生搬行李進去，弄得濮先生有門不得進，無可如何，答應了房東高價要求，才得卸下行李。是呀，在合肥房荒嚴重的今天，有屋可住，已是幸事，又何暇免房樂的剝削呢？</p>
<p>記者到此地的那天，因爲輪船抵埠已晚，入城後竟找不着旅社，好容易投宿到一家鷄鳴早看天的小各棧，次日住到勝利賓館去，勝利賓館是省政府所設的招待所，在合肥還找不出有像這樣的旅社，房間與招待都很好，而且規定不收費，但記者住進去只是權宜之計，所以現在又遷到社會公寓來，這是社會服務處所辦的，房聞雖小，此較一般客棧旅社取費略微低廉。在此，應感謝他們給予記者方便。</p>
<p>合肥房荒在目前似乎還沒有適當解決辦法，首先，省府設治並不永在合肥，各廳處辦公地點雖是侷促，只好暫時將就，公務員本身也因既是省府還要遷回安慶，又何必自建住宅，馬嚴虎虎住下去算了，至於民間，誰都感到生活的壓迫，有房子蹲身就讓它擠擠了，實在不得己也多搭蓋草房，暫時容身，等喘過一口氣後再作計議，如此，公家無意建設，私人無力建設，房荒如有讓它荒下去了！</p>
<p>娛樂荒　不樂之處也是樂</p>
<p>不論你先住家或者做公務人員，大一家同聳的感覺是生活上太單調，年青的朋友們更有寂寞無邊之感；如果你想在娛樂方面找來作生活的調劑，就夠你傷腦筋了。</p>
<p>現在合肥有京戲院一家，電影一院兩家，可是你找不到娛樂的。京戲方面，藝員們的藝術水凖固然低得可以，而所演戲目卻也不能令人愜意，經常所演的是「寶蟾送酒」，「　絲洞」，「紡棉花」之類的東西，有時則是他們自己編演的新戲，許多場面都十分牽強無味，只是給年青的夥計們多一點下意識的刺　。至於電影，五彩舶來片固然在此無福消受，國產片也多是戰前或是些落水影星在抗戰期間的有毒作品，什麼「孟麗君」，「梅花落」，「碧羅公主，「野薔薇」，瀟湘夜雨」等影片，都在這兒受到迎迎，這絕不是觀眾水準低落實在找不對娛樂，不得不「就地取藥」呀！於是京戲電影場場滿座。</p>
<p>除此以外，沒有舞場，沒有公園，連一個小坐的茶社也沒有，不倫你向何處走，除掉遇着朋友撩撩天而外，以有在屋子裏悶悶了！</p>

<p>燃料荒　童山　　看無邊　提起燃料，問題可鋔嚴重了合肥城內，現有五萬五六千人，每天燃料消耗相當鉅大，而且前燃料主體爲野草，柴，木炭。雖是離合肥不到九十公哩便是淮南煤礦，可是淮南礦路自水家湖以下尙未復軌，煤產卻運向蚌埠轉銷連浦隴海兩路一帶了，巢縣裕豐煤礦所出小量的煙煤，也有少數運銷合肥，但只有浴室餐館採用，住戶絕不購買，因此野草，柴，木炭，便大量暢銷了。</p>
<p>野草，柴，木炭，以合肥西鄉，出產最多，完全靠人力肩挑或獨輪車運到城內，野草普生山野故價值較廉，每擔售價五千元以上，至於柴和木炭，價值就高了，柴每擔最低需要一萬元，木炭則爲三萬二千元。近來，眼見雨雪的冬天轉瞬便到，柴草會有一天有錢無市，住戶們多在積存一點，於是，物稀爲貴，價格在漸漸上漲，更有人出來做這種生意了，譬如就柴這方面說，有人下鄉和鄉民接洽，說定一棵樹多少錢，價值原是不高，經他砍伐搬運到城裏，便身價十倍了，如此一來，生財有道，便有許多人幹這行生意，鄉下樹木一天天在少，城裏城價一天天在高，這種情形長久下去，消費者多花幾文倒是小事而鄉下樹木不但無增而且日日伐之，這就愈加嚴重了，這幾年來我們國家對於造林確曾有一番努力，而這里有造林，更沒有保林，反而在競相伐林，你說這該如何是好？目前，合肥燃料成本，比用煤要高些的，四鄉又盡是濯濯童山，將來，柴炭價格只有日日高，鄉下樹林日日少，燃料荒便也日日嚴重了。</p>

<h3>醫壇新話</h3>
<p>— 紹</p>
<p>鏈黴素臨床實驗一千例</p>
<p>鏈黴素，即斯瑞妥美星（Streptomycin），乃靑黴素（配尼西林）後最有希望的抗生性物質（Antibiotic）。美國政府於本年三月起聯合各有關方面作有組織有計劃的大規模臨床實騐，以確定其治療價値。國立研究院化療藥物委員會亦參加機關之一，最近由Keefer氏領銜，於九月份美國醫學會雜誌發表一千例之臨床實騐結果，全文二萬餘字，乃此素文獻中最重要之一，已擇要收入抽作青徽素與鏈黴素及其他抗生性物質一書中（該書係青黴素治療學之增訂第三版）。</p>
<p>鏈黴素的治療價值</p>
<p>據目前所知，鏈黴素乃土拉菌病，流行感冒桿菌傳染，華蘭氏染色陰性桿菌所致之泌尿道傳染，及該類病菌所致之菌血症與腦膜炎之最有效療劑。</p>
<p>對於傷害，浪形熱及沙門氏菌傳染（即副傷寒等），鏈黴素之治療成績至爲可疑，目前難作斷語。</p>
<p>至對各種結核病的療效，鏈黴素確有相當價値，但僅爲目前標準療法之輔助療法，不得恃作唯一療法。對於彌漫性結核如粟粒結核，結核性腦膜炎及喉頭結核，鏈徽素有抑制結核桿菌繁育而阻止病勢行的作用。對於滲液型肺結核亦有同樣療效。</p>
<p>鏈黴素的實際應用</p>
<p>鏈黴素的臨床應用有許多實際困難。</p>
<p>第一，目前產量有限，美國各廠出品均爲政府機關收買，市上極難買到。即能買到，其價値奇昻，每公分約美金八元。每日量在二公分至五公分之間，對於結核病至少治療三月至六月，對於其他傳染，至少亦須一二星期。</p>
<p>第二，採用此素時，如劑量不足，體內病菌極易產生抗藥性，而使治療失效。故如決定採用此素治療，必須開始即用足量，且須繼續應用，貫澈到底。因目前供應困難，故開始治療前必須將數星期乃至數月應用的全部藥量購足，俾治療不致中斷而產生抗藥性病菌。</p>
<p>第三，鏈黴素有相當毒性，美國已有因用此素致死者數例之報告，故用時應審慎，不宜採用靜脈內注射。</p>
<p>但是，這種種困難並非無法克服，估計明年此時當能解決大半。</p>
<h3>目之衛生</h3>
<p>— 繆連恩</p>
<p>目爲五官之首，與健康有密切關係，不幸失明，其痛苦不言可喻。綜觀國人因目疾致盲者頗衆，若人人對目部有適當衛生常識，非僅能防免疾患，更可增進幸福耳。茲將目疾之來由及其預防方法，略述於左：</p>
<p>（一）先天性目疾：目疾有自先祖遺傳而接連發生於一家者，如先天性內障與色盲，前者即施以手術割除，未免因視力之不足，對細膩工作，無力勝任，後者或因不辨紅綠色，故無法致力於交通事業；有因父母之血親關係而貽害子女者，如網膜色素退化症，患者在童年時或不覺有異，迨至少年及中年時，感覺夜盲，目力漸退，視野（視力之範圍）漸縮，於是患者僅見正前方、不見兩旁；有因父母之性病傳染子女者，如先天性梅毒，兼發目疾，致成殘廢；亦有父母之近視，遺傳于女者。故欲防免比類疾病，唯於擇偶方面，愼加注意，身染梅毒之母親，尤應早予驅梅治療，則他日定可產一健全嬰兒也。</p>
<p>（二）後天性目疾。（甲）傳染性目疾：傳染性目疾均由細菌或細微體傳染而起者，急性結膜炎，角膜潰瘍，沙眼，淋菌性眼炎皆屬之。母親或保姆患結膜炎或沙眼，因接近之故，最容易傳染予嬰兒，孩童之玩具與雙手，須時時保持淸潔，以免將細菌帶入目部。成人經手持鈔票，報紙，門球，自來水籠頭，車票，以及一切公共塲所之物件後，甚易由手指將細菌帶入目中，故平日切忌以手揩目，必需時宜以潔凈手帕代之，尤宜養成洗手習慣。患者之盥洗用具與家人所用者絕對隔絕，並耐心就醫，蓋沙眼一症非短時期內所能根治。母親有淋病者，當嬰兒經過產道時，淋菌潛人目中，產後第三日眼皮腫脹，洩流膿汁，不即醫治，則眼珠破穿而盲。近代產科醫生對初生嬰兒，均施眼炎預防法，因此疾病率較前减低。內症能引起目疾者有腦膜炎，麻疹（俗稱痧子），傷寒癥，痢疾，瘧疾，腎臟炎，斑疹傷寒，回歸熱，糖尿症，後天梅毒，及結核症等。小兒因傳染病致盲者多見，最大原因爲營養不足，甲種維太命之缺乏尤爲主因。（乙）非傳染性目疾；屈光不正（指近視，遠視，老視），斜眼，內障，損傷俱屬此類。屈光不正者，時感工作不便，應由專家愼重騐光配鏡，謹以增進視力，消除自力疲勞。如發現小兒有斜視，亦應先檢騐目光，蓋小兒之斜眼大半爲屈光不正所促成。吾人應竭力打消「戴眼鏡愈戴越壞」之誤念。爲預防計，嬰兒之玩具應綫條粗大，不引起嬰兒之注視爲宜，臥室之光綫不宜直接照射頭部，頭部宜背窗背燈。孩童書本之字體宜寬大，且應端坐並保持兩目與書本間之相當距離，約十二至十四吋。歪頭閱書寫字，均須改正。不見課室黑板上之字體，閱害後感覺眼脹頭脹或疼痛者，均爲屈光不正之現象，須請專家檢騐，往往一經戴上眼鏡，舒服如常。內障一症，亦應由專家治療，大半需手術割除。現代工業逐漸發達，眼睛之損傷時見，輕則影響目力，减低工作效率，重則失明，貽害終身。資勞雙方均應嚴密防護。電銜工人戴避光鏡，打鐵工人戴避鐵鏡，可免除許多損傷。輕傷者常因拖延不治，因此本可治愈之創傷，竟成不治，尤其在化學藥品誤入目中時，應立即用淸水冲洗，然後往醫生處診治，痊愈之望亦厚。</p>
<h3>慢性中耳炎</h3>
<p>— 王鵬萬</p>
<p>其病理及其治療原則</p>
<p>講論本題之前，吾人應先將「慢性」與「中耳炎」之定義，加以解釋。一般耳科權威，多以爲急性中耳膿炎如六個月後不發生任何嚴重現象，而仍繼續有膿液溢出，即可稱之爲慢性中耳炎。六個月實爲一最寬大之限定，因多數在六個月之前，即已演成慢性狀態。至於本文所指之中耳炎，爲鼓膜有穿孔，常有膿液溢出之化膿菌性中耳炎。不可與一般所謂之慢性中耳加達兒相混淆</p>
<p>慢性中耳炎治療之原則，完全根據其分類而定。茲先將其分類之辨別，略述於下：</p>
<p>依組織學而論，耳鼓膜可分爲兩部，即耳鼓膜本部，與耳鼓膜上部。根據專家之統計，與吾人之經騐，慢性中耳炎，其鼓膜之穿孔在其本部者，無論膿液量如何之多，或膿液臭味如何之重，從無嚴重併發症之發生。所謂嚴重併發症者；爲腦膜炎，內耳膿炎，側竇血栓，血中毒，腦膿腫等類危害生命之疾患。反之，鼓膜穿孔之在鼓膜上部者，則往往經數年，或數十年後，發生以上所述之嚴重併發症。至於發生乳突部穿孔，耳後膿腫者，尚係較輕之併發症。鼓膜上部穿孔之慢性中耳炎病例中，於中耳與乳突中可尋出膽脂瘤類似體者至少在百分之九十以上。而此膽脂瘤類似體，漸漸長大，侵蝕四週之骨質，推進細菌傳染，即爲造成各種嚴重併發症之原因。</p>
<p>是以依鼓膜穿孔部位之區別，慢性中耳炎可分爲兩種。其穿孔在鼓膜之本部者，從無任何嚴重併發症之發生，爲單純性慢性中耳炎，其穿孔在鼓膜之上部者，往往有嚴重之併發症發生，爲腦脂瘤性慢性中耳炎。</p>
<p>此二種慢性中耳炎，除由穿孔部位不同而診斷外，尚可使用試騐療法，與乳突X光照片，而區別之。蓋患耳所溢出之膿液，無論臭味如何之强，如無膽脂瘤類似體存在，則經十日之灌洗，滴藥，與鼻咽部之消毒，此臭味可完全消除。但如有瞻脂瘤類似體存在，則其溢液無論如何微少，任何治療皆不能將此臭味减輕也。此外乳突部之X光片，亦可證明慢性中耳炎究竟屬於何種。因膽脂瘤性慢性中耳炎之乳突部多有特殊之影形也。</p>
<p>單純性慢性中耳炎，乃一無危險之疾患，而膽脂瘤性慢性中耳炎，則係一極危險之疾患。因此吾人可規定單純性慢性中耳炎之治療原則，應以使中耳清潔爲目標，而膽脂瘤性慢性中耳炎之治療原則，應以减除其危害生命之可能性爲目標。</p>
<p>欲使單純性慢性中耳炎之耳內淸潔，應注意外聽道與耳咽管。外聽道之維持淸潔較爲簡單。如灌洗，再加滴藥，（如硼酸飽和於七十度酒精中）每日使用數次即可使其相當淸潔，膿液减少時則治療次數亦隨之减少。直至無膿液時，治療即可停止。治療期間，或停止治療期間，外聽道應隨時以樂棉阻塞，以免塵土或汚水之侵入也。維持耳咽管之淸潔較爲困難，因耳咽管與鼻咽部，鼻腔，與副鼻竇，皆有密切之關係。患者如爲小兒，則應注意其扁桃腺與咽鼻部淋巴繁殖之情形。患者如爲成人，則其副鼻竇應有嚴格之檢查。幷施以適當之治療，以使耳咽管得以淸潔。</p>
<p>解除膽脂瘤性慢性中耳炎危害生命之可能，應用手術將此膽脂瘤類似體由中耳與乳突之中取出。其標準手術爲乳突鑿開術。</p>
<p>總結以上所論，治療慢性中耳炎，應視其分類而規定之。單純性慢性中耳炎，旣無危害於生命，其治療之原則爲使中耳淸潔，中耳本身無需手術。但膽脂瘤性慢性中耳炎，因有危書生命之可能，手術治療爲其唯一之治療方法。</p>
<h3>抗瘧新藥</h3>
<p>— 張明</p>
<p>因爲全批界的奎寗生產，差不多全部集中在荷印一地，所以兩次世界性的大戰中，基於奎寗來源切斷的威脅與切斷後引起的恐慌，各交戰國莫不致力於抗瘧藥的研究。</p>
<p>第一次世界大戰中，德國在封鎖中努力於奎寗代用品的找尋，雖然在戰事中未得實惠，但終於戰後發明了拍拉母星與阿的平兩種合成抗瘧藥。</p>
<p>這次大戰中，德國在此方面無何重要成就，而英美中三國科學家經數年的努力，均有相當成績。英國發明了怕羅屈林（Paluorine），在化學上與已知之抗瘧藥完全不同，因此開闢了抗瘧藥研究的新的途徑，故其潛在的重要性或較其實際重要性更爲宏大。此離效力强，副作用小，且有减少復發率的可能性。美國對於抗瘧藥的研究，規模極爲宏大，研究之藥物不下數千種。已發表之藥物中以格魯若奎（Chloroquine）最爲特出。此藥效力甚强，奏效旣速且久，復發率大爲减少，副作用更較阿的平爲少。此藥早經德人合成，但認爲療效不佳而放棄；美人採用較佳之研究方法，竟發現其如許優點。吾國在抗戰巾亦多抗療藥之研究，惜因設備之簡陋，工作環境之惡劣，未能有何重要發現，僅足稱述者惟常山抗瘧療效之科學的證明而已。此藥之繼續研究現已自渝遷滬，在渝所得數種結晶成分，現正再加精製，冀闡明其化學構造。至於常山之實際價値如何，現尚不能確定，因目前所得有效成分尚具相當毒性。</p>
<h3>脚氣病之預防　與平民論增進健康之一</h3>
<p>— 倪章祺</p>
<p>外貌看不出有病的人有時覺得軟弱無力，容易疲憊或身體某部麻木，或腿部疼痛等等。初起頗輕，漸漸加重。這類病人往往繼續執行其業務。但因軟弱無力，容易疲憊，使業務屢受損失。成千累萬農工因軟弱疲憊致產品减少或品質低劣，若屬點工計件，或自耕農則農人工人自己受損失，若屬按月給資則公司受損失。積少成多，合全國計之，每年損失之鉅，使人驚駭，但數百年千年繼續如此損失，至近來始稍有人注意。</p>
<p>若無適宜的醫治或防止，則此病繼續進行，工作的效能繼續减退，個人與社會的損失繼續增加；若始終不加治療，又不改良其飲食，‘也有生命危險。</p>
<p>從許多不同原因能發生疲弱麻痛，決不能僅靠一個簡法預防許多不同原因所致的各種疾病。本篇講的備法專指預防從同一原因而發生的一種病而言，就是專指預防所謂「脚氣病」而言。許多人誤稱一稱皮膚病（俗稱「香港脚」）爲脚氣病，所以特別提出疲弱麻痛等字以醒目，可避免誤會。</p>
<p>每一脚氣病人的痰弱麻痛等等癥狀，不必同時就完全顯明。普通初期症狀爲疲憊軟弱，這時期病人自己不承認有病，他人也不曉得他有病。病人雖照常工作，但做得不好與遲慢延誤的事件一天一天的加多，每天能做成的工作比以前减少。</p>
<p>覺着軟弱無力，容易疲憊，不容易出勁，這是脚氣病（這並不是趾間濕癢的香港脚（人很普通的症狀。在此時期，照普通人看法，不算有病，但工作效能减低已雊使事業上經濟上遭受損失。後來麻木疼痛等症狀出現了，工作效能當然更减低，事業上所受損失當然更大。</p>
<p>昔年菲律賓與日本軍隊中患這病的人很多。後來改用糙米（新去穀穀而尚未變味的糙米）以代替白米，就能完全防止這病在軍隊中出現。許多人民不昔以糙米代白米，所以這病在菲律賓仍沒有絕跡。菲島人死於此病者一九二七年有一萬七千餘人，一九三七年尚有一萬六千七百九十七人。以每十位病人中死一人計算，那末菲島人每年患這病的人數在十七萬左右，十年的總數就有一百七十萬左右之多。</p>
<p>吾中國人口比菲律賓多數十倍，患此病人數，雖無準確統計，大約每年有數百萬之衆，單拿疲憊軟弱麻木疼痛等初期病人來說，這數百萬病的損失已是可驚。</p>
<p>但這類疲弱麻痛的病苦與因此而致之事業上工作上的損失，皆有簡易可靠的預防法，旣容易實行，又可絲毫不加開支。預防法有二：（一）每餐吃的粥飯，宜用蒸穀白米煮成，不可用生穀白米（即普通白米）；（二）或用糙米代白米，就是常吃糙米飯。</p>
<p>第二法無需解釋。在產麥而不產米的地方，可用糙麵粉以代替白麵粉糙麵粉（就是帶着麩皮和麥胚的黑麵粉）比白麵粉便宜，糙米的價亦決不比白米貴，所以此法不需增加任何費用。若厭粗糙不適口，可用第一法的蒸穀白米。</p>
<h3>蒸榖米的製法</h3>
<p>浙江長興縣及鄰近許多鄉村農民，在空閑時候，各家自製蒸穀米。所用器具與方法旣普通又簡單。先在蒸籠底舖稻草（潔凈布亦可）一層，把未浸水的穀放在蒸籠（竹製的蒸籠又可用以蒸饅頭與糕）內，把這蒸籠放在鍋上面用鍋中發出的熱汽蒸之。約蒸一小時再取出穀蒸籠，就烘之晒之風之使穀乾燥。蒸後應該使穀快快完全亁燥，乾燥的蒸穀可去殼去糠，使成半糙或全白的蒸穀米。</p>
<p>長興縣與鄰近鄉村產秈米頗多，就拿秈米穀製成蒸穀，在米店出售時就叫做熟釉或熟穀米。未蒸之秈曰生秈（生殺米）。每斗熟穀米（即蒸穀米）炊成白飯比每斗生毅米（普通白米）炊成之飯爲多（炊煮使蒸穀米比生穀米漲的更多）。因此蒸穀米價雖略昂貴，但蒸穀米白飯並不比普通白米飯稍昂。所以用蒸穀米以增加民衆健康，可以不加任何日常費用。</p>
<p>任何上等或次等穀類皆可製成蒸穀米。若用蒸全穀之法以蒸帶殼麥類，那末又能改良北省民衆的健康而不加任何費用。</p>
<p>蒸穀白米的乙一維生素仍十分豐富，確能預防因「脚氣病」而起的疲弱麻痛等病苦。凡糙米與普通頂優白米的優點，蒸穀白米也完全兼備。但無他們的缺點。</p>
<p>江浙等省內許多村鎭區邑民衆數千年來已有吃蒸穀米飯的習俗，在歷史上習慣上旣有此事實，很容易因勢利導，提倡推廣蒸穀米的產銷與炊食。由數十鄉村鎮邑推廣至數千城鎭市，由江浙推至全國各省及批界產穀諸國。大城市人民可託米店或鄉鎭親友向產製蒸穀米的農村訂購。需要旣多，農民不愁無銷路，就肯多製蒸穀米。</p>
<p>中國向來許多蒸穀米的產製所，散在於許多農村家庭，製法簡單，不需任何機器設備，資本工資等等。輕而易舉，任何農家都能蒸製。</p>
<h3>精神病人也是人</h3>
<p>— 夏鎮夷</p>
<p>世界上有千千萬萬的男女在痛苦的深淵中生活着。他們能聽見別人所聽不見的聲音，也能看到人家眼睛所看不到的形像，他們更能想到許多超乎情理的離奇思想，他們有時表面上露着笑容，可是內心却蘊藏着痛苦。他們有時雖呈着緘默鎮靜，但內在的思想却似萬馬奔騰，此起彼伏，或充滿着焦慮，恐懼與懷疑，因此莊嚴的人可變成無恥，忠實的人可變成欺騙，活潑的人變成呆滯，快樂的人變成憂抑……。換句話說他們整個的生活已脫離了現實的軌範，而進入不可控制的幻境中去了。這些人便是批界上最不幸的精神病者，更不幸的是我們一向給他們一個可怕的名稱「瘋子」。從這名稱所產生的感覺是可怕與卑夷，因此人們對精神病人非但沒有如身體疾病一般寄予同情，相反的社會上對待精神病人的態度仍不免冷酷，歧視，卑夷以及慘無人道的待遇，我們應在人道的立塲上爲他們疾聲的呼籲着：「精神病人也是人」。</p>
<p>在十九世紀以前大家迷信精神病人有魔鬼附身體由於天神降罰，因此精神病人的待遇是慘無人道的，那時所謂治療只是監禁和虐待。他們終身囚於木籠中，繫着鎯鐺的鐵練，不時加以兇惡的毆打，使與社會隔絕，聽其自生自滅，好像對待囚犯一樣，不，他們簡直不是人的生活，眞似對牲畜一般的殘暴。直到一七九二年比奈爾氏（Philippe　Pinel）在巴黎Salpetriere地方開始實行釋放精神病人運動，他除去了院中的鐵練，改用人道的待遇，可惜他的力量不能超出巴黎一區之外，但他力關精神病的原因由於魔鬼作祟的繆見，並主張用人道同情的方法去醫治，却影響後來一般人對精神病者態度。後來美國狄克思女士（Dorothee　L．Dix）繼續努力奔走呼號爲精神病者請命，結果在加州成立了卅二所的現代化的精神病院。由此精神病人的待遇脫離悲境，漸見曙光，到一九〇二年美國康乃鐵克州有一位雅魯的畢業生皮爾氏（Clifford　W．Beers）因患精神病曾在公私立的精神病院中度了三年的非人生活，身受院中醫生護士們種種殘酷兇暴的待遇，又目歷其他病人的種種病苦，不禁深深感動，因此病愈出院，誓願將剩餘的生命，貢獻給一般可憐的精神病者。他向各方呼籲，並終身努力從事防止精神病的工作，他更於「精神病人也是人」的人道的立塲上，普遍的改善精神病人的待遇與矯整對精神病人歧視的態度，他更將自己在病院中的生活用生動的文筆寫成了一部巨著—「一個找着了他自己的心」，他實是心理衛生運動的鼻祖，也是全世界精神病者的大恩人。</p>
<p>時代的巨輪雖已進展到原子時代的今日，歐美先進各國的精神病人已解脫了非人道的桎梏而能與其他疾病一樣的受到科學的醫治。再看看我國的情形，怎不令人爲數百萬精神病的同胞痛心呢！許多鄉鎭都市中對精神病仍沒有深切的認識，他們醫治的方法仍不脫十八世紀的標準，不是求神佛，吃仙方，便是毒打驅邪與終身監禁。我曾親眼看見我的故鄉有一世代書香之家，特製了木籠，監禁了二代的精神病者，這是何等的慘事！我們還可看到人們常對精神病人吐以唾液或投以石子作種種侮辱的舉動。更有許冬病人的家屬認爲精神病是可恥的，或以爲家門不幸，有損名譽。因此常秘而不宜，不給予一個治療的機會。可是話又得說回來，這也不能盡歸咎於民衆的，若眞欲求科學的醫治，又苦無設備周全合乎科學的現代化精神病院，不談僻壤的市鎭，就是通都大邑的上海以極有限的精神病院的床位，怎能使所有精神病人得到科學的賜予呢？在歐美的先進國家的公立醫院中精神病人的床位常超過其他疾病床位的總和。</p>
<p>精神病人旣不幸得此痛苦的病症，這是與身體其他疾病沒有兩樣的。生了傷寒症的人，全愈後可做一番事業，精神病人復原了何嘗不能做一番轟轟烈烈的偉業呢。皮爾氏便是一個最好的例子。二者都是「病」，有什麼可恥與卑視。相反的，我們對精神病人更應寄予極大的同情。事實告訴我們精神病已不是像以前所想像的那麼神秘或絕症，在現代科學進展中，已有極大治愈的希望了。我希望精神病者的家屬們不要再執迷着迷信或加以監禁或歧視，應送入科學的精神病院中醫治。更希望衛生當局與社會人士深切感到「有病無處醫」的痛苦，普遍的設立現代化的精神病院，這實是最偉大的慈善事業。也是推進心理衛生工作必要的步驟。</p>
<h3>人與病菌之戰！（續完）</h3>
<p>— 摘自「傳染病管理」　喬樹民</p>
<p>抵抗力之增强</p>
<p>次言抵抗侵入病菌的感染—如病菌竟穿透粘膜或皮膚而入於體內，則網狀內皮系之防禦目甚重要。噬菌細胞之活動如何，足以決定感染之成立與否。如何增强此類噬菌活動，惜吾人亦無所知。大抵急性感染之成立，係於侵入病菌之數量與毒力者大；而慢性感染之成立，則多與營養狀况有密切關係。所謂良好的營養，不僅指食料配製之適當，而尤指影響新陳代謝的各個因素（如疲勞運動空氣日光等）之協調焉</p>
<p>近據蘇聯科學家Bogomolets之研究，注射微量之抗網狀細胞毒素血淸（Anti—reticular　cytotoxin　serum），頗能增强網狀細胞之吞噬活動力云。</p>
<p>（十）特殊抵抗力的產生——預防接種</p>
<p>採用預防接種，以產生特殊抵抗力，實爲近代人類之最偉大的發明與貢獻。吾人現尚未能以預防種種防免所有傳染病。各預防接種之效用，亦多未能完全可靠或持久。一切均在繼續研進中。已可供實用之預防接種方法，得分類如次：</p>
<p>B自動免疫法——用疫苗以激發免疫力。</p>
<p>A用孱弱的活的病菌以爲疫苗：</p>
<p>（一）牛痘苗——種痘以免天花。</p>
<p>（二）蟲咬病預防疫苗。</p>
<p>（三）疸病預防疫苗。</p>
<p>（四）卡米革林結核苗菌（B．C．G．）</p>
<p>B用殺死的病菌以驚疫苗：</p>
<p>（一）傷寒預防疫苗（應自含有V1抗原之菌種製成）</p>
<p>（二）霍亂預防疫苗。</p>
<p>（三）鼠疫預防疫苗。</p>
<p>（四）肺炎預防疫苗。</p>
<p>（五）破傷風預防疫苗。</p>
<p>（六）百日咳預防疫苗。</p>
<p>A用病菌的毒業或抗原以爲疫苗。</p>
<p>（一）白喉預防疫苗——毒素。類毒素，明馨沉澱類毒素。</p>
<p>（二）猩紅熱預防疫苗。</p>
<p>2．被動免疫法——用含有免疫體的血淸，注射於人體，立即可以產生短期的免疫力，但在體內消失甚快。故僅宜暫用於已有感染，或將有感染危險之人。</p>
<p>A用動物血淸：</p>
<p>（一）抗白喉血淸。</p>
<p>（二）抗猩紅熱血淸。</p>
<p>（三）抗破傷風血淸。</p>
<p>B用痊愈患者的血淸：</p>
<p>（一）患過麻疹者的血淸。</p>
<p>（二）患過水痘者的血淸。</p>
<p>（三）百日咳痊愈血淸。</p>
<p>（四）流行性腮腺炎痊愈血清。</p>
<p>（五）脊髓灰白質炎痊愈血淸</p>
<p>C混合自動被動免疫法——例如白喉之毒素抗毒素的混合液之注射，麻疹痊愈患者的血清之晚期注射。</p>
<p>預防接種，對於若干傳染病流行之防制，甚具功效。當某種傳染病發生時，如具有感受性之接觸者，均經預防接種而獲有免疫力，流行自無從發生。即使不能全部接受預防接種，而儘有半數接受之，其防制流行發生之功效，亦殊可觀。右列十項，爲管理傳染病之一般步驟，亦即戰勝病菌之不二法門。如何運用靈活，有乎其人，亦隨疾病之性質而異。</p>

<p>沒有和大千相見，已有七年了，這次大千由成都來滬，我們第一次相晤，他劈頭第一句便說，真把我說楞了。是的，二十七年秋間，大千到香港將要回川的前夕，曾替筱丹世兄，時同客香澥，明日予亦將發桂林歸獨矣。他日當相期於劍閣青城間，出此圖共　，一大笑也。」</p>
<p>其後他們果然在四川重晤了。卅三年夏間，大千派他子姪門生們，在重慶舉行大規模的臨摹敦煌壁畫展。事畢，我的家人和他們乘車到成都去，獨有我在渝期間，沒有到成都，因此大千便有這句問話，在事實上他是該問的。老實說，我在重慶幾年，先後在交通部公路總局和軍委會戰時運輸管理局工作，要是想着乘車到成都去，本來非常方便，可是沒有特殊的要事，便不想走動。因此入蜀三年，只是蟄居在山城一隅之地。</p>
<p>去秋九月，我由渝返滬，許多朋友見着，雖然沒有和大千見面，但是消息常通，且不時有許多朋友往來，因之知道很多。加以抗戰以後，大千兩次到香港，我們幾乎天天都有會面，所以也可以略爲說說。</p>
<p>大千這次到上海，有些刊物，不知自慰的，傳說不盡不實的消息，有說他這次畫了幾十張老虎，也有說他帶了兩三個太太來，也有說他生活很困苦。——這些都是無中生有的事，根本不認識大千的人。大千始終不畫老虎，畫老虎的是他的二哥善子，已於廿九年逝世了。這次大千到滬，是一個人，家眷還在成都。說是生活困頓，更是違背事實。雖然沈尹默曾戲說大千是「富可敵國，貧無立錐」。但是這是另一方面的話，絕不是指大千的生活而言。因爲大千四十多年來，根本不把金錢放在心上。社會上旣然有些人不了解大千，那我站在二十年友誼的關係上，來談談大千，也許不致於隔膜吧。</p>
<p>大千是天姿奇逸，聽慧絕倫的人，不特能書能畫，而且能詩能詞，能刻圖章，真是多才多藝。生平好揮霍，心所好的，千金一擲無吝色，有時身邊或者一文都沒有存貯，但是遇着名畫，雖值最高的鉅價，也必先行留下，再行設法籌措交易。因之二多年他所得名畫，富而且精。估客因他精於鑑別而又豪爽能出高價，得着名畫，多先送他欣賞購置。大風堂所藏精品較多，即由此而來。</p>
<p>他對於飲食也很精研，最推重川粵菜。精於烹飪，逢着嘉客蒞止，常常跑入廚房親自弄菜奉客。（江翊雲替我題大千繪趙堯生詩卷第二首：「海內張髯有盛名，敦煌歸後筆尤橫；難忘聽雨蕭齊夜，出綱江鱗手自烹。」也是說他親自弄菜）。好吃冰其淋，一年四季，隨時一次可以吃好多杯。十年前，往往爲吃一元多錢的冰其淋，而化去前三元的汽車費，滿不在乎。平時不吃菸，不喝酒，要是碰着好友良會高談闊論的時候，一碗一碗的邊飲幾斤，也絕沒有一些醉容，逢着旅行，輪船火車旅館，必擇頭等而乘用。衣服僕素，終年穿布襪，但享用卻極奢侈。戚友因急需有所求，莫不盡力佽助，遇着手頭緊，那就立即伸紙寫書給人去換錢。有時爲着朋友求借很急，或是數目較大，便將所藏名蹟押去幾張取錢給友，這種急人之急，是很難得的。</p>
<p>他作畫　例，取銷了十多年，平時外間求他繪畫，若果沒有困線，雖送豐富潤金，常不肯下筆。即使有人紹介，擱置了一年半載，也是常事。可是啊，他在高興的時候，往往只須數小時，便可一氣繪成好幾張。尤其是賓客盡歡酒酣耳熟的場會，口講手寫，山水花鳥，仕女人物，隨興即畫，畫好即題，真有「手揮五指目送飛鴻」之概。要是他的好友，那就隨時找機會請他作畫，他不拒絕。而送給朋友的，又是精品的居多。以前的朋友中得他畫的，首推亡友岑玉岑。我得他的畫　卷幅扇冊，合起來也有幾十件。可惜有一部分，因爲滬港戰亂散佚了。他常說：「人生最可珍貴的是友情，尤其是認識得我的作品的友人。金錢有什麼寶貴呢？如果金錢是可寶貴，我現在也可以擁着無數的錢做富翁了。」是的，金錢在他的手中放出去，前前後後，真是不可以數計的。</p>
<p>美髯公大千的行動，非常率真灑脫，也很有風趣。他本是基督敎徒，但他少年時爲着戀愛糾葛，一度在松江禪定寺做過幾個月和尙，現在還是用「大千居士」來署款。他好遊覧，要是他的念頭一動，不論什麼時候，想着雄壯，日相狎接，蘊在胸襟。又富於藝術的天縱才思。兼以不斷地用功，纔能夠有今日的成就。他的大風堂裏，珍藏着歷代名畫千餘件，縱覧百家，不拘一體一格，和什麼派別，都下過一番苦功，尤其是畫得石濤，八大，石谿，漸江，大風，冬心，新羅各家的奧秘，融會貫通，擷取古人的精華，去掉他的糟粕。一筆一畫，無不意在筆先，神與古會。用筆縱三橫，澤厚蒼潤的氣韻，鎔合同北宗於一罏，自成蹊徑。這是達到神化的高峯，沒有一點拘牽跡象的了。加以二十年來，游歷國內外名山大川，……游踪所到，莫不在那窮山荒谷的斷崖絕壁古剎長松的地方，領略風雨請晦的真趣，採取大自然的景象，來做畫材。如石濤所說「搜盡奇峯打草　」。所以他的畫，一切布局設色，無不匠心獨運，籲直以造化爲師，來自寫他胸中的宇宙境界。又如惲南出甌香館畫跋所說，「一草一樹，一丘一壑，皆靈想所獨闢」了。…」</p>
<p>大千臨摹古畫的功夫，真是腕中有鬼，所臨的青藤，白陽，石濤，八大，石谿，老運，冬心，新羅各家，確能亂真。尤其仿作石濤，最負盛名，不特畫的筆墨神韻，和石濤真蹟一樣，題字圖章，印泥紙質，也無一不弄到絲毫逼肖，天衣無縫。但是他當作是游戲的工作，在好友前，絕沒有一點隱諱。可是一般畫商與好古的藏家，得着石濤畫本稍精的，莫不詫歏訝發生「這是大千所作的」的疑問。然而大千所作的石濤，固已散遍世界，顛倒國外的鑑藏家了本來以假亂真，是藝術家的狡獪手段，朋好談笑，也可以取樂一時，是不足爲訓的，但是學習國畫必先臨古，臨古必求他的維肖維妙，可以亂真，這是學畫必經的階段，不可忽視，所謂溫故而知新。可是近年大千作風變了，以前那些製作古畫，他在的生命史上，只是游戲人間不可磨滅的一頁罷了。</p>
<p>大千的畫風怎樣轉變的呢？那是他萬里長征，到敦煌去，在中外藝術交流的總匯，潛心繪畫幾年，這一個轉變，使他的作風，由石濤，八大，石谿，老運等，而轉到六朝五代來，這種崇高偉大的繪作。真是宣咸沙漠，馳譽丹青，在中國畫史上，除了大千之外，截到現在，還沒有第二個人。因爲有他志願，未必有他的能力，有他的志願與能力，未必如他的天才思想能夠融合去運用。那麼，大千之所以爲大千，不能不說是當代世壇的特殊人物了。</p>
<p>前幾天，和葉遐翁（恭綽）談到大千的畫。遐翁說：「大千今後的作畫，最好專向人物畫方面寫作，因爲當代找不着人物畫的畫人。而中國繪畫，本來人物畫最重要。在千有繪畫的天才，有精深的造詣，住在敦煌多年，正宜發揮他的長處，爲近代中國畫壇放一異彩，爲中國藝術接續他的光榮史」。遐翁於大千相知極深，這番話實是的論，我也同此意見。特爲寫錄，作爲本文的結束。</p>
<h3>張大千在近代畫史</h3>
<p>— 鄭午昌</p>
<p>據無法有法，無法之法自我立，有法之法自我得，得人之法而爲我所用，立我之法而爲人所不及，則無往非未能，無所不工，是爲大家。往昔畫哲如顧，陸·曹·吳·荊·關·董·巨·劉·李·米·郭·馬·夏·黃·王·倪·吳·文·沈·唐·董·以及八大，石濤，薦爲一代宗匠者，無不得人法而立我法，窮人天之變，樹開繼之功。有清自四王冠冕畫苑以還，重名之下，學者風靡；或有創製，輒目爲怪。數百年來，臨摹者多，創作者少。習某家法而自鳴高者有之；集人我法而自成家者，則殊尠。大千八兄抱邁古之志，稟絕世之才，不屑隨俗好惡，初以地史目爲奇怪之八大石濤法，發揚光大，振盪近世畫壇；於陳腐頹廢之風習中，別開生面，繼乃集取唐宋元明諸大家法。以寫其遊踪所至之自然景物，奇麗雄健，以見我法。近復自絹以外，追尋畫源，盡數年辛勞，走窮邊荒漠，搜摹敦煌諸窟壁畫；凡六朝隨唐畫人之取材，構圖，用筆，設色諸法，熟於手，得於心，法於古，新於今，故其所作，閃故復薦高古·大千自謂「坐六朝之　廡，入隨唐之堂奧，」有此抱負，具此魄力，到此工夫，數百年來，恐無第二人。位諸古大家之列，真無多讓。近大千展覽其近作於中國畫苑，山水人物花烏，都八十餘幅，不知識者以吾言相質，爲何如耶？</p>
<h3>秋·抒情</h3>
<p>— 胡膺東</p>
<p>秋，散文的季節，可是面對着這種佈滿了毒霧的都市，我早就失卻了這份散文的心情。</p>
<p>生活，蠶食了我的心苗，每天，每天，當我從機械單調的生活方式里解剖出來的時候，我總是負着創傷與疲倦的心情歸來的。</p>
<p>人性被淹沒，青春被廉價地拍賣，沒有意志的自由，沒有由衷的歡笑，我的週圍盤旋着生疏與虛偽，秋，面帶着嘲笑式的緘默，她已貼近我底身畔。</p>
<p>我厭惡，我想離開這裏，飛奔到郊野，昂然佇立於崗上，面對雲天呼嘯，放開胸襟高歌，不讓半點塵垢沾汚我的靈魂，也不讓魔鬼在眼前跳舞。</p>
<p>當現實生活扣打着我的腦袋的時候，我知道這境界離我是如何的遙遠。</p>
<p>秋，這裏的秋是仕女身上的海勃絨時裝，十字街頭神女的誘惑的笑，良鄉熱栗泛濫的香味，</p>
<p>此外，此外，我再也找不到什麼了。</p>
<p>在秋風裏，我看到牽強的笑，掛在人們的嘴唇邊，依偎金條約愛，燃燒在人們的體腔裏，人，就是那末的，從這裏，我發掘出二十世紀的人類的感情。</p>
<p>秋，妳多麼深沉，多麼世故，可是我已斷定了妳的命運將是死一般沉寂的嚴冬，殭化的木乃伊！？</p>

<h3>賦贈大千居士</h3>
<p>— 許士騏</p>
<p>大千居士壯遊宇內，歷覧名山，寫作等身，藝林珍貴。抗戰軍興，卜居蓉城，（蜀人回蜀，非「重慶人」也，）曾遠走青海，探勝燉煌，圖寫壁畫，偉麗精工；蓋欲恢復唐人遺韻，發揮東方文藝復興精神，誠壯舉也。</p>
<p>日前偕湖帆道兄造訪，值祖韓·介堪·稚柳諸子，縱談甚榮。大千謂年來物價狂漲，一畫收入，不逮一席之資，擬改業廚師，一獻身手。客有爲其策劃，可在滬設一燉煌飯店，出售佛脚冰其淋。（燉煌石窟，佛像脚下奇寒，滴水成冰，大千喜貪冰其淋，一次盡四五杯。）大千廿年前，已于思于思，今日丰采如昨，蓋黑髪假老頭也。</p>
<p>萬里邊陲壯遊，河山偉麗畫中收；</p>
<p>經年圖壁燉煌窟，重到江南未白頭。</p>
<h3>一寸山河一寸血　100</h3>
<p>— 葉勁風</p>
<p>所以鶴見道時，不僅不願跟這幾個忘命之徒，來開玩笑，並且特別小心謹愼；雖不逃避，卻也暫時忘了這兩天的疲倦，暗自加緊脚步，預備抓個機會，實行一下金暗脫壳，免除這段麻煩。誰知道這裏鶴見脚步一緊，後面吊着錢的六人，追得更急</p>
<p>鶴見瞧這形勢不對，便把領結鬆了，胸部馬夾上的紐扣，也解開幾粒，兀自自言自語說：「不想走了兩步路，就這們熱了；」一邊說着，一邊便把那緊緊裏在身上的夜禮肥，突地卸了下來，搭在手腕上，這一切準備，是預備動手主搏鬥的時候，省得被這些衣物束縛住了，不得施展。</p>
<p>剛才準備對敵的當咪產，順眼向前一看，瞥見三五十步外，一家西式酒吧，仍舊燈火輝煌，知道正在做着銀座，劇院，散場以後的都市，心下忽然得了主意。當下一壁放慢了脚步，一壁又把鈕扣和領結邊走邊整理，只餘下禮服，仍舊搭在腕上，走到距離酒吧不到幾步，才停歇下來，先打量了一下酒吧燈火市招，好像要把這段地點樣子，又向對街及兩頭看了一看。實際上，他是要瞧瞧這些尾隨的傢伙們，如何動作，殊不知剛一回頭，見那一大段路上冷冷清清，只有稍稍搖曳的樹影和電綫木桿，此外連鬼影都不見一個。</p>
<p>鶴見知道那般尾隨的傢伙，因料到他要進酒吧去，所以預先藏了起來，鶴見因而想了也好，暫且在這酒吧休息一下，等體力稍稍恢復些，再看事行事。」想想着便把禮服重又穿上。</p>
<p>這間酒吧，外形雖不見特別，一走上台階，就知道這是一間華美而澈底西式的酒座舞廳。外面沒有花式裝潢，僅僅門楣上很藝術化地嵌着「新綠」兩字。鶴兒先把禮服和領結，重新整理一下，那門上的看守，早躬着身子，把大門拉開了一爿，這裏因有冷氣設備，所以直進三重門，都有人待候招待着。</p>
<p>鶴見寄頓了禮帽，暫不入座，便先去打了一個電話，呌寄寓的那家「江川」旅舍來，派人到上野公園，把自己的車子調。出了電話室，就告訴那正待候着的領座招待，原意找到一個舒服座位，不必有人陪酒陪舞；日人只在休息。又吩咐他知會門上，如自己的汽車來了，就呌司機到這廳堂來回一聲。</p>
<p>這酒座舞廳，卻是一個幽美偉大的場面；燈光，裝飾，座位，舞池，卻佈置得十分優美，色調調和，雖在午夜後酒客男女，仍舊相當擁擠。這時音樂台奏着時下流行，日本倣製的西式樂出「少女之春」，舞池已經三三兩兩，湊上舞池，隨着樂聲，走着探戈步子。除了音樂的輕演徐奏之外，竟連咳嗽的聲音都沒有，日本人竟把一個「靜」字訣，做到十分成功夫，卻也難得。</p>
<p>鶴見頭尾有五六個年頭，顯然與東京的社會生活隔絕了，所以這時，見了這酒座的一切，心下一面驚異進步之速，一面卻感覺十二分的不安，因爲在他腦海裏面，現在還連續不斷地正一幕一幕，映演着長辛店電台報告的種種戰情，北平一帶，日本軍人的橫衝直闖，日軍大砲的狂吼，東北淪陷數年以來，在日人　類脚下，踐踏得回不過氣來的同胞，正在計劃着對中國的屠殺搶奪，等等。而在東京這裏，這個一切暴行的發源地，卻是恁地安安靜靜，清歌妙舞，太平得像月宮一般。座上未輪到派遣的軍人，和一些官僚政客，紳士，仕女，交際花等等，臉上都掛着寗靜笑容，好像世界上就沒有侵略屠殺這件事似的。</p>

<h3>狂戀</h3>
<p>— 少夫</p>
<p>本市最近曾上映琪恩泰妮與康納維爾德合演的「狂戀」，這張影片的英文原名爲Leave　Her　to　Heaven,許多看過的朋友，都說好，好的理由是它充分描寫了一個女性對男性熱戀發展到極致而發生的戀態心理。</p>
<p>有些男子會感覺到他們的妻子的全部佔領壓力而受不了，雖然他們都深深理解到對方的熱愛，也爲這種熱愛所感動，可是在現實環境裏（不是亞當夏娃的伊甸園），一個男子又能怎能把全部時間，全部身心交給自己的妻子呢？即使他願意，事實上也很難做到。</p>
<p>因此，遇到這種情形——無法接受好意——的男子，其內心的痛苦怕不會在　與好意而不得的女子之下。</p>
<p>不分性別，一個人總有他或她的「靈魂的一隅」的，這一隅，除自己外，即使兩個人日夜廝守着寸步不離，而彼此意識領域中所對外界反映或構成的觀念，不一定相通，不一定能彼此都全部赤裸裸地相向，這也是人類中的一種可悲處，因之，兩性中的彼此佔領畢竟是有其限度的了。</p>
<h3>不勝今昔之感　紐約城沒落了</h3>
<p>— 耳君</p>
<p>有一位老紐約，華克爾先生，是一位名記者，最近在報上發表了一篇文章，對於紐約的生活，認爲大不如前，使他厭倦了，想離開紐約，到一個山明水秀的僻靜地方，去優遊下半生的歲月。</p>
<p>第一個使他感到頭痛的事，是捐稅的名目和數目愈來愈多。紐約城的財政，久已是一個麻煩問題，現在越來越惡劣，幾乎已至山窮水盡，無法解決的地步。新市長阿杜葉，雖是一位有名的行政家，可是一到任就得籌劃八千萬元美金的新財源。這個城從純粹的外表而論，簡直是窒息得令人透不過氣來。地道內擁擠不堪，年代歷久，也需要修理和清除。公共汽車的系統，日漸腐敗；出差汽車的服務，似乎也沒有以前的便利。街道交通日趨惡劣，停車的問題簡直無法解決；市當局雖然規定了不少調整交通的規則，在事實上卻少有裨益。這些市政，在在需錢辦理，所以新市長一到任，馬上就忙着開源之道，於是市民的捐稅負担就加重了。</p>
<p>紐約城因爲生活程度高，她的許多工業不能與生活程度低的城市工業相競爭。現在真正金融力量的實座是在華盛屯。市當局雖然想將紐約城變成世界「時裝的中心區」，可是時裝工業已今非昔比，已移往加州，甚至台克塞斯州去了。</p>
<p>居不易　房屋荒也是當前的一個緊急問題，而這個問題也不是短期內能改進的。犯罪率日增月異，晚上行走在街道上，不若往日那樣的太平。生活是越來越複雜；罷工，罷工，日有所聞，使居民惶惶不得安居。據一些專家們說，以目前空運日趨進步的傾向說來，紐約城不久也許落在支加哥城的後面，不能再是美國第一大都市。</p>
<p>則在娛樂及文化方面，情形也大不如前。雖然表面上仍是熱鬧如昔，但本質已變。除了些色情的娛樂之外，以前高雅遊息之所以，一天減少一天。人們的態度，待人接物，也變了。從前的熱情，和靄，如同一家人的精神，今已消逝無踪。現在的人都是冷冷的面孔，除了談生意，想方法賺進別人的金錢之外，沒有一些友情與同情，有也不過是虛偽而已。</p>
<p>悲喜劇　不問明日趨勢如何，這已是一個確定的事實，這個事實由來已久，沒有因爲戰爭而有所歷更，就是紐約市已變或一個不容易生活和工作的地方。到這個都市來遊歷，不能享受任何舒適了。她的精神，和她的個性及重要的感覺，業已日趨衰落，尤其在最近的十餘年之中。紐約市所表現的生活面，只是一齣悲喜劇式的鬧劇。</p>
<p>厭倦了　華克爾先生，是一九一九年到紐約市來的，在那裏的生活。他願意到一個僻靜處所，去養些白臉的牛羣，紅毛的猪，黑色的羊，種些番薯和胡辣，砍柴，傍晚的時候，在燈下看了舊小說，藍天是聽聽古典音樂（無綫電收音機裏所播送的）。不願多談話，除非找着了知音的人。而他最以爲寶貴的東西，是能享受生活中的自由。</p>
<p>胡不歸　筆者在上海也住了快近二十年，也厭倦了上海的生活。我憧憬我家鄉的生活，在那裏有廬山的遠景，有甘棠湖的清幽。寓居在上海的人們啊！在這滿市塵埃，百物昂貴，房屋恐慌的時候，上海有什麼值得留戀呢？你們的田園將蕪，胡不歸去啊？</p>
<h3>跟着人家喊</h3>
<p>— 文</p>
<p>朱經農先生於日前出席青年會之義務靈修會席次發表演說，題爲中國之心理建設，他沉痛地說「中國人最不好的劣根性，就是「盲從」，也是「人云亦云」。他還舉了一個例說，最近有要求美軍撤離中國之呌聲，但美軍在中國者僅三千餘人，而且這三千人並不集在一處；而某國軍隊在大連一處已超過一萬五千人，難道這區區分散的三千人的爲害較之聚集在一塊的一萬五千人尤甚嗎？爲什麼祇有人嚷要求美軍撤離而沒有人嚷某國軍隊應撤離中國呢？」</p>
<p>聽了朱先生的話，不　要奉勸　動的朋友；不管贊成外國軍隊留或退，最好取決於自己的決定，跟着人家喊，無異對自己的輕視！何況「人家」是有「人家」的算盤呢！</p>
<h3>電車火車化</h3>
<p>— 俞</p>
<p>上海的電車已經「火車化」，如不信，請看下面理由：</p>
<p>一·我們常見許久沒有車來，而一來之後，就十幾輛連在一起，這是形式上的「火車化」。</p>
<p>二·有些車子，一部份車站不停，一部份車站停的；這是「特別快車」。</p>
<p>三·有的車子，從開出後一站也不停的；這是「直達車」。</p>
<p>四·又有二路電車，開回時，中途換掛一路的牌子；這是「區間車」。</p>
<p>五·有的總站不上客，開到總站後一站或二站再不客的；這是「西站上車」。</p>
<h3>無名氏</h3>
<p>— 聖潔</p>
<p>往往有捐款的人雖然捐了錢，但並不願意求虛名，因而無以名之，名爲無名氏。</p>
<p>民國卅年，一位廿六歲的青年作家，寫了一本書，呌「露茜亞之戀」，出版後，銷路不佳，悶悶之餘，便絕跡文壇，苦苦地潛修了兩年。民國卅二年，他又在西安，以試探的姿態寫了兩部小說：「北極風情畫」與「塔裏的女人」，因爲兩年前寫的一本書沒有銷路，再也不敢用以前筆名，於是乾脆以「無名氏」爲筆名。在他的原意，是感覺自己文藝造詣不深，不敢輕易露真面目。想不到這兩本書竟暢銷了大後方。西安·重慶·昆明·蘭州等的青年讀者，無不欣賞；因此，無名氏卻變爲有名氏了。</p>
<p>勝利以後，無名氏與大後方的讀者告別了，連一點音信也聽不　，最近，忽然在本埠某晚報上發現了一位作者，也呌無名氏，但據我所知，無名氏生生自寫完那兩部小說後，曾著重對筆者說過，以後再不願意在報紙上發表文章，要想看他的文章除非是書。果然，日昨得無名氏來信，說他正在杭州，寫一部一百八十萬字的長篇小說，書名呌「野獸！野獸！野獸！」據此，可知此「無名氏」非彼「無名氏」也。</p>
<p>這裏使我感到興趣的是：「北極風情畫」的作者以「無名氏」得到「名」，可知文章之成就尙在文章本身，只要文章是行的，無名氏也會變爲有名氏的；反之，文章不行，則「有名氏」者卻也會變成真正無名氏的。</p>
<p>還有，無名氏這三字用作筆名，雖甚討巧，但這三字性質又酷似「趨未定章」一類的題目一樣，常會被人掠美，（如某夜報上之發現無名氏）所以，無名氏（指北極風情畫作者）先生，是否將在無名氏後面加一註解，素性露現廬山真面目如何呢？</p>
<h3>低調</h3>
<p>— 禾草</p>
<p>徵兵·捉迷藏·太不像話</p>
<p>最近有不少鄉下人逃到上海來，爲的是政府正在徵兵。可是一般的鄉下人目光中，根本不知道什麼呌徵兵，只知道呌抽壯丁，抽了去便是打仗，打便是死，於是紛紛逃匿，買壯丁也時有所聞，值此秋收，爲害非淺，更加一般官吏，以爲有機可趁，於是興風作浪，乘此搜括敲詐，倒給他們大大的肥了一下。</p>
<p>我以爲應於宣導工作上特別努力！又據報載上海有這么多的失業或無業的遊民，政府爲不把他們抽了去訓練，確是一舉二得的事。</p>
<p>最近在馬路上，時可看到一輛吉普卡，裏面坐着幾位巡警先生們在「兜風」，捉拿攤販，成績確乎圓滿，攤販們望車披靡；但等他們一去，那些攤販們又紛紛的從路角，僻弄，或其他地方匯集攏來，依舊做他們的交易。這種情形彷彿捉迷藏真是有趣！</p>
<p>十輪車用卡向來是在市區內橫衝直撞，大逞虎威，而小市民們一向是被欺侮慣了的。忍氣吞聲，誰敢說一句話？不料不久前這原子老虎竟在北四川路上發起虎威來，撞壞了市長的泗，幸虧吳市長「寬宏大量」，說：「只要他下來打個招呼，也不會呌他賠的。」但那不識相的軍用卡，竟逃之夭夭，難怪市長發火說要嚴加緝辦，大槪要給他一點苦頭吃，否則查明來又何用？市長又說：「這太不像話了，這太不守秩序了。」但市長可不知道老早已太不像話，老早已太不守秩序了，不過我們小百姓有什麼辦法呢？</p>

<h3>從地獄里逃出</h3>
<p>— 羊仁</p>
<p>我們那裏會知道一個癮君子要游出黑海，須經過如許磨難與痛苦呢？這裏，是一個現已斷癮朋友的經騐之談：</p>
<p>戒煙在三難：一懶二念三清底，懶與念不過感覺難受，至於清底，那真是性命交關，我因經濟關係，用的是林十八藥酒沖淡遞減法，　了一月，總算成功，但精神萎靡不振，無論何事，都無興趣，即使說門外堆着許多金條銀逺，只要去俯拾即得，可是我寗願失此良機，臥而不動，實在連這一點舉手投足之勞的精神，竟也沒有！其懶可知。</p>
<p>名義上雖說戒了，然而念念不忘者，仍是此「君」，真可謂縈紆繞，夢寐以來，假使那時候能得重逢，最容易言　舊好。</p>
<p>你知道「清底」是怎樣一個事？說來奇怪：大約過了四個月光景，人家都說我比前胖了，家人們對於我的完全斷癮，也深信不疑。一天，我自戒煙後初次上街，經過舊日「香巢」，不禁大動慾火，也不顧數月苦功，跑進去，急欲一親「芳澤」，許多舊雨，招待不絕。呀！我真要感謝那位前輩「老槍」，他竟如此對我說：「我老朽了，沒有辦法！你年青，旣已戒脫，爲什麼還要再來？這豈非枉費了一番苦心麼！」那時我已把煙裝好，預備「進口」，猛聽此言，良心發見，便把煙槍放下，摸出相當法幣，丟在炕上，算是會鈔，一言爲發，逕自出門而回；未及到家，只覺頭暈目眩，天旋地轉，一陣惡心，大吐不支而踣，我昏厥，等到醒來，已在家中床上。</p>
<p>你以爲我吐的是什麼東西？卻原來是烏黑黑濃稠稠一大堆從鷹胃裏括下來的「老膏」！經此一吐，才算把毒質清底，雖又病了月餘，然從此舊情斷絕，再不作依依之想了，你看這最後一關，奇也不奇？難也不難？</p>

In accordance with Article 2 of the National Assembly Presidium Election Regulations, the Assembly Presidium was elected. Representatives arrived one after another around 2 PM. The atmosphere inside and outside the venue was filled with greetings, laughter, and excitement. All the Assembly staff were mobilized, doubling their efforts. The chrysanthemums on display were completely replaced in the morning, dazzlingly vibrant. The atmosphere of the Assembly was completely refreshed, tense, and enthusiastic, unprecedented since the opening. At 3:12 PM, the first bell rang, and the representatives took their seats. Chairman Chiang also entered the venue with his wife. Subsequently, Hong Lanyou reported that the total number of representatives was 2050, with the appointment of 1660 representatives already announced. As of the start of the meeting, 1548 had registered, and 1467 were present, sufficient to meet the legal quorum. At 3:20 PM, Sun Fo continued to serve as the temporary chairman, presiding over the meeting. First, the rapporteur read the minutes of the second preparatory meeting, followed by Hong Lanyou reporting on the election process and list of elected candidates for the Presidium. Hong began by stating: "The Presidium candidates from each unit were all elected yesterday. As for the re-elections of some representatives and those who voluntarily gave up their elected positions, they have been successively filled by those with the most votes. A total of 179 candidates were elected from 53 electoral units." He continued, "Representative Chiang Kai-shek was elected as a candidate from the Nanjing electoral unit. The National Assembly Chiang Committee, considering that Representative Chiang had already been elected by the Kuomintang, sent a letter to the Nanjing electoral unit requesting a re-election. The reply stated that after careful consideration, they firmly requested Representative Chiang as a candidate for the Nanjing area, and Representative Chiang accepted, giving up the position elected by the Kuomintang." Finally, he read the entire list.</p>
<p>Chairman Chiang and His Wife Personally Voted at the Ballot Box</p>
<p>After Hong finished speaking, he read a temporary motion from Zhu Jingnong and 126 others, "Proposing to reserve seats in the Presidium for the Communist Party and the Democratic League to demonstrate the spirit of peace and democracy of the Assembly." It was unanimously passed with applause, reserving five seats for the Communist Presidium and four for the Democratic League. Subsequently, Yang Dizhong, a representative of the indigenous people of Guizhou, moved to confirm and add seats for candidates of ethnic minorities to the Presidium. Zhu Jingnong and more than ten representatives of various indigenous groups from the Southwest, including Ma Qingweng and Shi Hagui, spoke in succession, and the debate was extremely fierce. Finally, Hong Lanyou, on behalf of the chairman, announced that Representative Zhang Dao Fan had been elected as a Presidium candidate in the Kuomintang unit and voluntarily gave up the seat elected in Guizhou, which was filled by Yang Dizhong, a representative of the indigenous people of Guizhou. A dispute was resolved after much debate. At 4:20 PM, Chairman Sun Fo announced: "The election begins," and asked the journalists and non-staff members in the venue to leave to facilitate a headcount. Subsequently, Hong reported on the voting instructions, requesting each representative to secretly select 46 people from the list of 55 printed on the ballot (excluding the seats reserved for the Communist Party and the Democratic League) and read the list of the 64 voting supervisors designated by the Chairman. Subsequently, ballots were distributed, and each representative left individually after voting. Chairman Chiang and his wife personally deposited their ballots into Ballot Box No. 2 in front of the speaker's platform next to their seats at 4:55 PM.

<h3>Marshal Ma Ming Departs for Tianjin</h3>
<p>Will Stay for About Ten Days</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent, Nanjing, 21st] Conner, the press officer of the US Embassy, announced on the 21st that Marshal Marshall plans to leave Nanjing with his wife on the 23rd for a short trip to Tianjin for several days, and may return on the 25th or 26th. From 1924 to 1927, Marshal Marshall was stationed in Tianjin with the US 15th Infantry Regiment and had many friends there. He has long intended to revisit the old place. It is not yet known whether he will stay in Peiping for a while.</p>
<h3>Incumbent Civil Servants May Not Be Dismissed Without Cause</h3>
<p>The Executive Yuan Issues a Circular to All Provinces and Cities for Compliance</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, This City] It is a common practice in all countries that administrative officials do not advance or retreat with political officials. The Executive Yuan, based on the proposal of the Ministry of Interior, the Ministry of Transportation, the Water Conservancy Commission, and the Ministry of Personnel for the protection of incumbent civil servants, resolved to forward it to the Ministry of Personnel for reference in the formulation of the Protection Law. Before the promulgation of the Protection Law, the National Government is requested to reiterate the previous orders issued to protect administrative officials and instruct all agencies to strictly comply. If there are any violations of laws and regulations, the Control Yuan should impeach and punish according to law. Before the enactment of the Civil Servants Protection Law, it has long been clearly stipulated that administrative officials of all agencies do not advance or retreat with political officials, and civil servants appointed according to law may not be dismissed without cause. The Executive Yuan has issued a circular to all provinces and cities. It is heard that this instruction has arrived in Shanghai. After receiving the order, the municipal government immediately instructed its subordinate agencies to comply.</p>
<h3>The Democratic Socialist Party's Meeting of Cadres in Peiping and Tianjin Passes a Resolution to Participate in the National Assembly, Provided that the Government Implements the Party's Proposals</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent, Peiping, 21st] Forty-one senior cadres of the Democratic Socialist Party in Peiping and Tianjin held a joint meeting at Tang Xiangming's residence on the afternoon of the 21st and decided to support participation in the National Assembly. The two important resolutions were: (1) To support Mr. Zhang Junli's conditions to Chairman Chiang and participate in the National Assembly under those conditions. (2) If the government cannot implement the conditions proposed by the Democratic Socialist Party, the Democratic Socialist Party may withdraw from the National Assembly at any time. Most of the government's attendees at the National Assembly still hope that the Democratic Socialist Party can continue to maintain its third-party stance in order to prepare for a second mediation. The opinions on participating in the National Assembly were very divided in the Peiping Democratic Socialist Party, but after Sun Baogang and Ye Duyi made extensive contacts and explained in detail the intentions of the Democratic Socialist Party members in Nanjing and Shanghai, the two resolutions above were passed on the 21st by a majority of thirty-two to nine. However, the debate was still fierce during the discussion. The meeting started at 3 PM and the vote was taken at 6 PM. Zhang Dongsun did not attend the meeting on the 21st and still insisted on his attitude of not participating. Another member of the Central Standing Committee, Liang Qiushui, also sent a letter to the meeting, stating that he personally would not participate in the National Assembly. Sun and Ye have successfully completed their mission to the north and will fly to Nanjing with Wan Renqian on the morning of the 22nd to report to Zhang Junli. At the meeting on the 21st, no specific decisions were made on the number of seats and election methods for the Northern Democratic Socialist Party. A general opinion will continue to be discussed on the 22nd, hoping that the representatives will be generated from the bottom up. In addition, it was heard that someone mentioned at the meeting that the Youth Party has one hundred representatives, and the Democratic Socialist Party is even more important than the Youth Party, and the number of representatives should also be expanded, and it is hoped that this requirement can be realized.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent, Nanjing, 21st] The Democratic Socialist Party's letter to the Presidium was submitted to Lei Zhen, Secretary-General of the Political Consultative Conference, on the 20th for forwarding to the Chairman. The Chairman's reply has not yet been sent out. According to Jiang Yuntian, it will be announced as soon as the Chairman's reply arrives, so that people across the country can understand. As for the content of the letter, it is not yet known. The Democratic Socialist Party is still waiting for Zhang and others to arrive in Nanjing before it can determine the list to be submitted to the National Assembly.</p>
<h3>Hou Beiren and Kuai Chao Fly to Nanjing</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent, Peiping, 21st] (1) Hou Beiren and Kuai Chao, important members of the Democratic Socialist Party, flew to Nanjing on the 21st. (2) It is heard that Chairman Chiang may present a reply to Zhang Junli in the shortest possible time. (3) The members of the Northern Democratic Socialist Party have a significant influence on the issue of the Democratic Socialist Party's participation in the National Assembly. Although it has been resolved under this situation, Zhang Dongsun's non-participation still affects Zhang Junli's personal decision.</p>
<h3>Chen Cheng and Li Zongren Reported to Fly to Peiping Within Days</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent, Exceptionally Huge Day] It is widely rumored here that Chief of Staff Chen Cheng and Director Li Zongren will fly to Nanjing on the 23rd.</p>
<h3>Legislative Yuan Changes to Meeting Today to Review the Constitution Draft Amendment</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent, Nanjing, 21st] The Legislative Yuan originally scheduled to open a joint review meeting of the five committees at 4:30 PM on the 21st to review the "Amendment to the Draft Constitution of the Republic of China" passed by the Central Standing Committee on the 20th and submitted to the Yuan to complete the legislative process. However, because most legislators were also National Assembly representatives, they attended the National Assembly Presidium election in the afternoon of the 21st and could not attend in time. The review meeting did not reach the legal quorum, so it was temporarily changed to 9:30 AM on the 22nd. It is heard that according to the legislative process, after the amendment is passed by the joint review meeting, it must be passed by the plenary meeting of the Legislative Yuan to complete the procedure. However, since it is a joint meeting of the five committees, if the members believe that there is no need to hold a plenary meeting, it can also be regarded as completing the legislative process.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent, Nanjing, 21st] The Amendment to the Draft Constitution of the Republic of China was passed by the Central Standing Committee on the 20th. This is sufficient to show the government's respect for the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference and its determination to realize democracy. Some people are quite worried about whether the case can be smoothly passed by the Legislative Yuan. A reporter visited an authoritative observer on the 21st, who said: In the past, the Central Standing Committee or the National Defense Council only decided on the principles of various laws, and then handed them over to the Legislative Yuan for drafting. This time, the Central Standing Committee passed the amendment, which was based on the principles of the Political Consultative Conference resolutions and revised and researched by the government representatives of the Political Consultative Conference Constitution Draft Review Committee, and then revised and researched again by the representatives of the Democratic Socialist Party, the Youth Party, and local notables to form a revised draft. Therefore, when it was submitted to the Central Standing Committee yesterday, it was already a bill, not a principle, which is different from the previous procedure. According to the law of power organs, after the Central Standing Committee and the National Defense Council pass a bill, the Legislative Yuan only completes the legislative procedure. Even if the Legislative Yuan has some disputes over the bill, there will be no changes. Outsiders believe that there will be some disputes in the Legislative Yuan, but this is unlikely to happen, this is one. It is also learned that after an hour of discussion by the Central Standing Committee, some members expressed different opinions, some advocated discussing it article by article, and some advocated deciding on the principles first. Later, because the President gave some instructions, the final discussion result was that the amendment had been carefully studied and there was no need to make any changes, so the original proposal was submitted for approval, this is two. Based on the above two points, even if the Legislative Yuan discusses the case, it will not extend the time very much, so there is no need to worry. When the amendment is submitted to the National Assembly in the future, it is believed that the Kuomintang will definitely find a way to promote its members to pass it in general in the National Assembly. From a legal point of view, neither the Kuomintang nor the National Government should forcibly dictate how the National Assembly should act. Therefore, if the National Assembly representatives have better opinions on the constitutional issue in terms of national and ethnic interests, they can of course provide them. At the same time, according to the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference, even better opinions can be put forward for research. The rumor that the government guarantees that it can pass the bill in the National Assembly is also not true.</p>

<h3>Minister Bai Tells Our Reporter; Opening of the Pacification Zone Political Affairs Committee; The Issue of Relief and Reintegration Funding is Decided</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent, Nanjing, 21st] Minister Bai Chongxi told our reporter that the Pacification Zone Political Affairs Committee closed in the afternoon of the 21st. As a result of the meetings in recent days, all matters related to the recovery of the pacification zone have been thoroughly studied, and the most important issues are relief and reintegration. The funding issue has been decided. In principle, each province will consult with the relevant ministries and departments such as finance, food, water conservancy, and health regarding the needs and finances of the pacification zone under its jurisdiction to determine specific plans and budgets. After approval by the central government, funds will be allocated quickly to carry out the work.</p>
<h3>Yan'an Orders the Communist Armies Inside and Outside the Pass to Prepare for a Large-Scale Offensive; Continuous Cannon Fire Along the Songhua River</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent, Tianjin, 21st] Relevant parties here recently received confidential information that Yan'an issued an order on the 18th for the Communist Armies inside and outside the Pass to launch a large-scale offensive against the National Army before December 25th.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent, Peiping, 21st] Reporters learned from various sources that a dramatic change will occur again in the Yan'an situation. Officials said that the Communist Army is making major movements everywhere and is preparing. The Communist side has the same accusation against the National Army. However, their opinions differ on where the future focus will be. Observers said that the Communist Party may abandon its base in northern Shaanxi and transform northern Manchuria into a new world. They also said that Yan'an has begun to evacuate. The internal situation in Hebei, Shandong, and Shanxi is becoming increasingly tense, especially in Shanxi. The Communist Army is actively fighting for favorable strongholds in the Lishi, Zhongyang, Linfen, Yonghe, and Xi County areas on the Shaanxi-Shanxi border. The northern section of the Pinghan Railway in Hebei has returned to a stalemate after a large-scale battle on the 18th with each side deploying 30,000 troops.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent, Peiping, 21st] Relevant agencies have learned that the situation in the Northeast is gradually becoming tense, and contacts in various places are becoming more frequent. Lin Biao's request to withdraw the Northeast Communist Zone Group has further stimulated this situation. Currently, the Northeast Communist Army is approximately 200,000, with approximately 100,000 scattered throughout Manchuria. The main forces are stationed in Taodouyouzhao and Baichengzi. Eight days ago, the Communist side stopped all passenger and freight transportation, and the main force gradually moved south. Outside the Songhua River, the sound of artillery fire is heard every day.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Peiping, 21st] Since Zhou Enlai, the leader of the Chinese Communist Party delegation, left Nanjing and returned to Yan'an, Yan'an, Dalian, and Harbin have gradually become the centers of the war. Large-scale war preparations seem to have begun in North and Northeast China. Ten more members of the Communist Party of the Military Mediation Headquarters left Peiping by plane today to go to Yan'an. The number of peace representatives left by the Communist Party in Peiping has been reduced to about thirty. Telegrams from Changchun and Shenyang are constantly reporting frequent troop movements by the National Army and the Communist Army in the Dalian and Songhua River defense lines.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent, Shenyang, 21st] Communist Party representatives of the Military Mediation Teams in various parts of the Northeast began to concentrate in Changchun on the 21st. There are eight military mediation teams in the Northeast, numbered 27, 28, 29, 30, 33 to 36. They withdrew from areas such as Anshan and Hailong. Li Chuli, the Communist Party representative of the 27th Team in Shenyang, flew to Changchun on the 21st and is said to be waiting for orders in Changchun. If the second withdrawal order arrives, the Communist Party representatives will fly to Harbin. The Communist Army in various places in the Northeast is busy preparing for war, and the National Army is also making defensive preparations. Zhao Jiaxiang, Chief of Staff of the Commander-in-Chief's Office, went to Changchun on the 19th. Zheng Dongguo, Deputy Commander of the Yingpan, who had just arrived in Shenyang, went to Anguang on the 20th. The New 22nd Division will be transferred to Changchun to strengthen the defense of Changchun City. Division Commander Li Tao is currently guarding Haicheng. In addition, the military mediation teams in the Communist Army areas include the Shuangcheng, Qiqihar, and Lafa Frontline teams. The places that Lin Biao referred to as not being able to guarantee safety are these locations.</p>
<h3>Fragments of the National Assembly Presidium Re-election: Chairman Chiang Receives the Most Votes, Mr. Wu Jingheng Announces First; President Dai Faints on the Spot, Alarming the Entire Venue</h3>
<p>— Our Reporter Pu Dejie</p>
<p>Three minutes before the meeting, Chairman Chiang, in military attire and holding a cane, entered the venue from the left door with his wife. Chen Lifu casually followed behind, but upon hearing about President Dai's fainting, he rushed to the entrance. Seeing that there was no major problem, he returned to his seat after informing the Chairman and attended the meeting.</p>
<p>Bai Chongxi arrived five minutes before the meeting. When he passed Zeng Qi's seat, they had a cheerful chat. Once he sat down in his seat in the first row, he became the target of news reporters. Chen Cheng, on the other hand, sat in the middle of the middle, talking quietly with his neighbors, inconspicuous and safe.</p>
<p>Miao Jiaming, with a full head of silver hair and gold-rimmed glasses, greeted acquaintances with kindness and sincerity. He walked to the podium, chatted briefly with the active Liu Hengjing, and then sat peacefully in the third row on the left.</p>
<p>President Dai was unwell, and when he entered, he walked weakly, supported by attendants. Before the meeting, he could not hold on and suddenly fainted. He was immediately helped out, got into a car, and returned to his residence to rest. The venue was briefly disturbed, and reporters rushed to the entrance to inquire.</p>
<p>Among the Kuomintang representatives, Chairman Chiang was selected as a candidate for the Presidium. The Nanjing district also unanimously selected Chairman Chiang. The Chairman's intention was to have Nanjing City re-elect, but the representatives of Nanjing City said that the capital is a place where people from all over the country gather, and the national leader should be selected. They decided not to re-elect and firmly requested Chairman Chiang to be a candidate for the Nanjing district, which won a big applause. After consultation by the preparatory committee, Chairman Chiang expressed his acceptance, and the audience applauded again.</p>
<p>For border residents to participate as Presidium candidates, Yang Dizhong, a representative of ethnic minorities in Guizhou, took the lead, causing a heated debate. Some said that it should be based on the election law and names should not be arbitrarily filled in. Some said that 25 million ethnic minorities should not be denied the opportunity to participate in the Presidium. Some said that they resolutely opposed adding units, and some said that they would withdraw if ethnic minorities in the border areas were not valued. The atmosphere was enthusiastic and tense. As a result, Secretary-General Hong reported that Guizhou representative Zhang Daofan had already been elected among the Kuomintang representatives. The elected position in the Guizhou district was abandoned and replaced by Yang Dizhong, so everyone was happy. A blackboard was erected on the left side of the podium, with three large chalk characters written on it: "Yang Dizhong", asking the representatives to correct it during the election.</p>
<p>Shi Qigui, a representative of ethnic minorities from Hunan, spoke, fighting for a seat for a border resident in the Presidium, but he was interrupted by the Chairman's frequent ringing of the bell and a power outage before he finished speaking. He reluctantly walked down from the podium.</p>
<p>During the heated debate, speeches were given very enthusiastically, replacing those who followed the order, depriving the latter of chances. When Hong Lanyou was ordered to report, someone with number 1855 loudly said: "I asked to speak a long time ago, why not let me speak?" Someone replied: "Don't speak." Hong turned around and asked Sun Ke, and then said: "There is still a report." The report resolved the problem, stopping the dispute, and number 1855 did not want to speak anymore.</p>
<p>A representative asked: "Why was Mr. Zhang Ji's candidacy for the Presidium cancelled?" Hong Lanyou said: "I just read it, I'm afraid this representative didn't hear it." "That's not right, it was published in yesterday's evening newspaper, but not in today's daily newspaper. It was read out just now. Why is it so casual to cancel and add?" Hong said: "Mr. Zhang was elected in both the Kuomintang and Hebei district units, so he gave up the Kuomintang aspect. The secretariat of the preparatory committee dared not add anything casually. The news published in the newspapers is not officially released. Everything should be based on the official report." Everyone spoke clearly and harmoniously, and the whole audience applauded silently.</p>
<p>Among the representatives were two big men, one was "Shandong's big man" Yan Guofu, and the other was Huang Zhengqing, the "Arhat" from Tar Temple.</p>
<p>One hundred and thirty-six students from the political school (including two female students) were invited to the meeting as vote counters, all in black cotton uniforms, with green staff passes and temporary venue passes attached to their symbols. They entered in a line, left in a line, and worked silently.</p>
<p>At 4:20 PM, the election began. All reporters were asked to leave the venue in order to count the number of people. For a while, the boxes and lounges were full of reporters. Some said, "It's not allowed." Some said, "Facts require it, it doesn't matter." Some said, "It's the old rule, the Political Consultative Conference is also like this."</p>
<p>The election campaign was heated before the meeting. During the election, the representatives held a pen in one hand and flipped through several different lists in the other, leaning over their small desks, earnestly circling on the ballot papers, like elementary school students taking an exam, flipping through cheat sheets on one side and doing multiple-choice questions on the other, working extremely hard.</p>
<p>At 5:00 PM, the reporters had eaten too many refreshments in the lounge and couldn't help but run out after finishing their conversations. Just as the Chairman and his wife finished voting and walked out of the venue, walking and smiling and nodding, "Good, good." Behind them was a large group of representatives who had finished voting, squeezing out of the boxes. The venue was full of representatives. Chen Lifu and Sun Ke were talking very seriously on the stage. Jiang Biwei, with double buns and a red coat, carrying a black glass handbag, went on stage to receive the inspector's badge. Some representatives were walking out, and some were still sitting in their seats.</p>
<p>After the election, the reporters began to enter. Chen Lifu was first surrounded, talking until the entrance of the Great Hall before breaking through the encirclement and getting into a car at 5:45 PM. In the venue, Hubei representative Deng Yulin was protesting why the votes were not counted publicly in the Great Hall. Hong Lanyou said: "There are too many votes, it's not easy to divide them into groups in the Great Hall. The Political Consultative Conference also counted the votes outside the venue. Fortunately, the ballot boxes are sealed, and there are also vote-supervising representatives. Reporters can visit at will, so it is still public."</p>
<p>There were a total of twelve ballot boxes, three upstairs and nine downstairs. In front of each stood a staff member of the assembly. The lids were sealed with the seal of the assembly, and the mouths were sealed by the four chief vote counters. The first one taken out of the venue was ballot box number three.</p>
<p>The vote counting was done in the conference room on the second floor. The mercury lamps were bright, and the representatives, staff, reporters, and photographers were extremely busy. The chief officials Wu Wangji, Yang Yifeng, Chen Yuke, and Cai Jinying commanded and reported very energetically. Sixty vote counters were divided into fifteen groups. After opening the ballot boxes, they received the ballots separately and worked actively. First, they verified the ballots. The first group to hand in the ballots, a total of ninety-six, completed the vote verification at 8:15 PM. It was counted that 1,467 representatives were elected, 1,446 ballots were issued, 14 abstained, and the total number of votes cast was 1,433, including 34 invalid ballots. The valid ballots, 1,399, were then distributed to each group to start counting and writing ballots. The room was full of the sound of "votes, votes," and the work was very intense. At 9:15 PM, the fifth group was the first to open the votes. As a result, at 2:15 AM on the 22nd, the first president produced was Wu Jingheng, with 802 votes. The person with the most votes was Chairman Chiang, with 1,371 votes. When it was calculated, everyone present applauded together.</p>
<p>The four chief vote counters took turns eating only after the vote counting started. Wu Wangji stood up at 9:00 PM to eat and said: "I can't handle it, it's too troublesome, I'm starving, I'm starving."</p>
<p>The deputy director of the assembly's news group, handsome, young, capable, and enthusiastic to help others, hastily ate a bowl of rice at 8:00 PM and then distributed mimeographed news releases to reporters everywhere: "Here you go." The reporters said: "Thank you, thank you, you are busy enough."</p>
<p>Before the vote counting, the reporters counted 1,467 votes, with 46 people per vote, for a total of 67,482 names. It was estimated that it would take an average of four seconds per name, requiring 75 hours. Dividing it into 15 groups would require five hours, which was the fastest speed. As a result, the vote counting started at 8:30 PM, and the calculation was completed at 10:35 PM on the 22nd. Although the actual number of votes was 69 less than the statistics, it took more than six hours.</p>
<p>At 2:35 AM, the vote counting was completed. The staff, who were extremely tired, and the group of reporters who had waited for most of the night, were surprisingly energetic. After sealing the ballots, everyone said: "Oh, thank God, we have finished a major event, go to sleep quickly, there will be a meeting tomorrow afternoon at three o'clock, it's terrible." (End)</p>

<h3>The Seventh National Defense Memorial Day: Chairman Chiang Writes to the Compatriots: Be Prepared and Avoid Being Despised</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 21st] The Seventh National Defense Day Commemoration Ceremony was held at the Dahua Grand Theater at 9 AM on the 21st. More than 2,000 people attended, including representatives from the Air Force Command and various National Defense agencies and units. Tang Enbo, concurrent National Defense Commander, presided over the meeting and reported on the relationship between National Defense and modern National Defense. Then, Huang Zhenqiu, Commander-in-Chief of the Joint Operations, Yang Ketian, a representative of the Municipal Government, and Wang Zuhua, a representative of the Municipal Party Committee, delivered speeches. After the speeches, Commander Tang respectfully read Chairman Chiang's letter to the compatriots on the National Defense Day. The meeting adjourned at 11:30 AM. Chairman Chiang's letter to the compatriots is as follows:</p>
<p>Compatriots across the country: Today is the Seventh National Defense Day. We have just passed the one-year anniversary of victory and restoration, and we are now advancing in national construction and military construction. We are holding this commemoration on this holiday to review the past and learn from our mistakes, strive for innovation, and seek perfection to achieve the ultimate goal. Regarding National Defense construction, the future is both important and huge. In the past, our country was invaded by enemies because our National Defense forces were not fully developed. Although we have achieved victory now, in order to ensure the permanent security of the country and maintain collective world peace, it is necessary to make active efforts in National Defense construction. National Defense is the center of National Defense. In wartime, it will exert its functions and effectiveness. In peacetime, there should be rigorous training and excellent preparation to accumulate self-defense forces and establish self-reliance. Moreover, since the application of atomic energy, National Defense technology has been constantly changing, and it is especially necessary to catch up quickly and make achievements. Then, ensuring security and maintaining peace can be truly effective. Recalling the period of the War of Resistance, the enemy attacked us with its superior air force, and the people's lives and property suffered painful sacrifices. Fortunately, our air force generals and National Defense personnel resisted with great difficulty. All major and small cities also had their reconnaissance and protection organizations, which were able to reduce damage, stabilize people's hearts, and stabilize our front lines. This spirit of generosity, loyalty, and courage is seen by the whole world and is commendable. In the future, we should continue to maintain it and not let it be abandoned, so that we can cope with emergencies one day. However, with the rapid progress of science in the future, if a war breaks out in the world, its form will be very different from the past, and its tragic and brutal nature will be a hundred times greater than in the past. We cannot rely solely on passive protection. We must enrich active National Defense facilities and create a central force for solid National Defense. On the existing foundation, we must cooperate with the country's economy and the progress of National Defense industry to seek the development of air force power. On the one hand, we must strive for scientific research and use the latest defense methods to fundamentally eliminate air strike damage, so that we can survive in the modern world. In addition, how to strengthen public propaganda, popularize National Defense knowledge, how to enrich National Defense equipment, and improve National Defense organizations, so that everyone knows and is aware of danger and is familiar with the strategy of preventing fires before they start, is something that the government and the people should work together to achieve. We have always been known for our love of peace, and we have the responsibility to promote world peace. We never want any country to suffer war again and make the people suffer again. However, National Defense preparation is what a country relies on for its security, and it is also a guarantee for consolidating world peace. We must be prepared for danger in times of peace, and plan thoroughly and in detail to achieve the goal of perfection, so that we can be prepared and avoid being despised. This is not only the end of National Defense. I hope that people across the country will pay attention to it, and the entire National Defense construction should also be planned and completed together by everyone. Let us encourage each other.</p>

<h3>Malaysian Overseas Chinese Face Discrimination: Rubber Industry Suffers Severe Losses: Chairman of the Chinese Chamber of Commerce Files a Complaint</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Singapore, 20th] Due to mismanagement and discrimination by local governments and the British Ministry of Trade, Chinese businessmen operating rubber businesses in Malaya have suffered serious losses since August. Li Guangqian, chairman of the Chinese Chamber of Commerce and a rubber industry tycoon, stated in a letter to Askolly, chairman of the United Rubber Planters Association of London, that the procurement system of the Trade Bureau in August and September was extremely unfair. Even if not intentional, in fact, there has been discrimination, which has been detrimental to local rubber producers and sellers. The Trade Department's reason is that it lacks transportation, so it has not been able to purchase rubber in Malaya. However, Li said: Any businessman in the local business community believes that if the Trade Department can express its willingness to abide by its promise to purchase local rubber, any amount of rubber can be transported to London. As far as I know, one company, unfortunately, lost a quarter of its capital, while another company lost more than 500,000 yuan. He suggested that tens of thousands of pounds originally allocated to Malaya for war expenses before Japan surrendered should be allocated for local reconstruction.</p>

<h3>International Wool Conference: Purpose and Results: Zhang Tianze Discusses His Attendance</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 20th] A Central News Agency reporter met today with Zhang Tianze, director of the International Trade Company of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, who represented our country at the International Wool Conference. Zhang told the reporter about the purpose and results of the meeting. He said: This conference lasted six days, from November 11th to 16th. Participants were representatives from 13 countries that produce or consume wool. Its purpose was to discuss methods to avoid market stagnation due to the large amount of wool stockpiled by various countries. The United Kingdom alone has more than 3 billion pounds of wool in storage, and the total amount worldwide is about 5 billion pounds. It is estimated that the amount of stored wool is sufficient for 8 to 13 years of consumption. Therefore, the conference decided to organize an international research group to discuss various details in the future. Zhang said when talking about the situation of wool in our country: Although China is not an important wool-producing country compared to other countries, since Chinese wool is mainly used for carpets, it is expected that the world's demand for carpet wool will increase significantly after the war. China is also unable to occupy an important position among refined wool consuming countries because the domestic wool textile industry is still in the initial stage of development. However, China is currently determined to develop the wool textile industry and increase the production of wool yarn and flannel to meet domestic consumption. Hankou, Shanghai, as well as Lanzhou, Xi'an, and Peiping will become important centers of China's textile industry. Zhang said: He had reported to the conference that China's comprehensive development of the wool textile industry will take many years, and it will be an important responsibility for the consumption of refined wool in the world. In order to accelerate the development of the wool textile industry, China welcomes foreign technology and investment in machinery and equipment.</p>

<h3>Friendly Treaty Signed with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia: Nationals of Both Countries to Enjoy Most-Favored-Nation Treatment</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 21st] Diplomatic circles report: A friendly treaty between our country and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia was signed in Jeddah on the 16th of this month. It has been noted that many of our Muslim citizens travel to Mecca, the Islamic holy land within Saudi Arabia, each year for the Hajj pilgrimage. However, due to the absence of a treaty between the two countries, their stay in Saudi Arabia has been inconvenient. In particular, if a pilgrim dies in Saudi Arabia, their estate is managed by the Saudi government and cannot be transferred to the deceased's heirs, resulting in substantial losses. Since June of the 31st year [of the Republic], the two countries have been in contact to establish a friendly treaty, with negotiations ongoing until an agreed draft was finalized and formally signed. It has been learned that in addition to standard provisions on dispatching envoys and establishing consulates, the treaty specifies the following two points: (1) Nationals of either contracting party residing or traveling within the territory of the other contracting party shall enjoy most-favored-nation treatment regarding the protection of their persons and property; (2) In the event of the death of a national of either contracting party within the territory of the other contracting party, if there is no legal guardian for their estate, it shall be handed over to the nearest consular official of their home country for transfer to the deceased's legal heirs. The treaty shall come into effect upon the exchange of instruments of ratification. In the future, the friendly relations between the two countries will undoubtedly be further enhanced as a result.</p>
<h3>Vietnamese Overseas Chinese Suffering Deeply: Frequent Robberies Ignored by Officials; Over 10,000 Killed in Conflicts Between French and Vietnamese Troops</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xiamen, 21st] The 600,000 overseas Chinese residing in Vietnam have recently been struggling to survive under near-constant robbery and terror. According to Mr. Chen Zhao-cheng, Chairman of the Annam Chinese General Chamber of Commerce, who returned here to attend the inaugural meeting of the South Seas Overseas Chinese Economic Development Corporation: In Saigon, the economic center of Vietnam, the 400,000 overseas Chinese living in the suburbs universally regard sunset as an ominous symbol, as large-scale armed robberies commonly occur every night after 8:00 PM. Often, dozens or even hundreds of thugs set up machine guns at both ends of the street and ransack homes without restraint until dawn. Initially, wealthy overseas Chinese were targeted for extortion, but later, both rich and poor suffered the same fate, with even furniture and clothing being cleared out. French and Vietnamese officials turn a blind eye, and even when overseas Chinese report incidents to the police, they are ignored. Mr. Chen left Vietnam on October 27th to attend the National Federation of Commerce and Industry meeting in the capital and flew to Xiamen on the 19th of this month to attend the inaugural meeting of the Economic Development Corporation. He reports that in the areas of Qi Huong City, Binh Phuoc City and Dang Village in Vietnam, Chinese suffered terribly as French troops burned villages and massacred more than ten thousand overseas Chinese in the conflicts between the French and Vietnamese. The situation was especially bad in Phu Tho Village, an industrial area where many overseas Chinese were involved in the leather industry. When a French soldier was killed by a Vietnamese citizen, the area was surrounded by French troops, and countless overseas Chinese were brutally killed. Houses and factories were destroyed. The devastation was even worse than in occupied areas during wartime. Therefore, the overseas Chinese in Vietnam now hope that the government will negotiate with the French authorities to fulfill the Sino-French New Treaty signed last November, guarantee that similar incidents will not occur again, and compensate the overseas Chinese for their losses.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Hanoi, 21st] As French and Vietnamese authorities were negotiating to cease all hostilities, clashes between French and Vietnamese troops occurred in the city of Haiphong on the 20th.

The conflict quickly spread throughout the city, and traffic between Hanoi and Haiphong has been completely cut off. It is reported that the clashes were triggered by disagreements between French and Vietnamese authorities over customs duties in Haiphong. As of the time of this dispatch, the conflict in Haiphong has not yet ceased.</p>
<h3>Some Traitorous Han Chinese Cause Trouble in the Beijing Prison; Traitor Zhou Fo-hai and Others Riot in Jail; Traitor Li Shao-tang Falls Ill and Requests Medical Release</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 21st] A bizarre prison riot occurred at the Tiger Street Prison in the capital on the 20th. Traitor Zhou Fo-hai led the inmates in a protest to prison officials. The incident stemmed from the fact that the traitor Li Shao-tang, who is in custody, was suffering from bladder inflammation and had been unable to urinate for two days. His family requested his release for medical treatment, but the request had not yet been approved. A group of inmates expressed their dissatisfaction, with the traitor Zhou leading the disturbance. Prosecutor Gong went to investigate, and the traitor Zhou stated, "Law is law," "Humanity is humanity," "Execution is execution," "Medical treatment is medical treatment," and delivered a passionate speech. The traitor Zhou Quan-sun, who had already been sentenced to death, also chimed in. After the prosecutor explained the situation, the inmates calmed down. The High Court is currently reviewing the matter.</p>
<h3>Traitors Zhou, Pan, Li, and Others Prepare to Apply for Retrial</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 21st] After the traitor Zhou Fo-hai was sentenced to death, his wife, Yang She-hui, commissioned lawyer Yang Jia-lin on the 20th to review Zhou Fo-hai's case file at the Capital High Court in preparation for filing an application for retrial. The traitor Pan Yu-gui, who was sentenced to life imprisonment, has also commissioned lawyers Ye Zai-hang and Yang Jia-lin to prepare an application for retrial. The prosecutor in Pan's case believes that the sentence was too lenient and is also preparing to apply for retrial. After the traitor Xia Yuan-zhi was acquitted, the prosecutor has also submitted an application for retrial to the High Court. In addition, the Supreme Court sent traitor Li Sheng-wu's case back for retrial, and his wife has hired lawyer Dai Xiu-zan to defend him in the retrial.

<h3>Editorial: A Comparison of Facts</h3>
<p>Since the CCP representative Zhou Enlai returned to Yan'an, the negotiations between the KMT and the CCP have come to an end. In order to fully demonstrate the spirit of "doing its utmost," the government, on the one hand, has been enacting a practical and feasible democratic constitution through the National Assembly and, on the other hand, has been actively consulting on the reorganization of the National Government and the Executive Yuan. The Standing Committee of the Central Committee and the Supreme National Defense Council also passed the draft National Government Organization Law on the 20th. The number of members of the Government Committee is set at 40, and the Executive Yuan is expanded to 38 ministries and commissions. The candidates for ministers of each ministry and chairmen of each commission have also been internally determined in order. It is hoped that the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference will be fully implemented, and it is hoped that the Democratic Socialist Party's participation in the National Assembly will not present any problems. The political situation in recent days seems to have become clearer, giving the general public, who long for peace and democracy, a sense that the future of the political situation is very promising. However, on the CCP side, its conscience is blinded by the private interests of one party, and it does not think much about the future of the country and the nation. It is still there, doing everything possible to launch a propaganda offensive, on the one hand attempting to undermine the National Assembly in completing its sacred duty of drafting a constitution, and on the other hand fantasizing that the National Army is attacking Yan'an. It wants to give people at home and abroad who do not understand the truth the impression that the entire China has been shrouded in the shadow of civil war and that there is no hope of becoming a strong, democratic, and unified China. It is not worth mentioning that a few foreigners may believe it because they do not understand the inside story of Chinese politics; but there are still some newspapers in the country that are willing to promote the CCP's propaganda offensive and claim to be "impartial public opinion." It really makes our people unable to understand.</p>
<p>The so-called facts speak louder than words. Let us list the facts of what the government and the CCP have done in the past month and make a comparison. The right and wrong, black and white, will be clear and self-evident. In the process of more than a year of negotiations, the government has always held a spirit of tolerance and is willing to compromise for the sake of completeness, but repeated compromises have not achieved "completeness." Even when the peace talks reached the end of the road, the government still put the country first and demonstrated the spirit of "doing its utmost" everywhere. All actions are based on public opinion. Because the people yearn for peace, the government automatically and unconditionally ordered a ceasefire; and because the people seek democracy, the government has long had the determination to return power to the people, so it decided to convene the National Assembly and draft a practical and feasible democratic constitution to lay the foundation for the rule of law and democracy in our country. On the eve of the opening of the National Assembly, the government had reached the point where it could no longer tolerate or compromise. However, at the request of the third party, the government postponed the meeting by three days. The government did not care about the CCP's shouts, abuses, and ridicule. It completely handled national affairs with a selfless and impartial mind. It was open and honest and there was really nothing to criticize or criticize.</p>
<p>Looking back at the CCP, when the battle in Zhangjiakou was urgent, it demanded peace and shouted loudly for "unconditional ceasefire." After the government truly issued a ceasefire order, the CCP bandits and spies refused to issue a ceasefire order at the same time and opposed the government's issuance of a ceasefire order. It even took advantage of the National Army's "guarding the original defense" to launch a large-scale counterattack on all fronts. The recurrence of the war in Hebei, Shandong, Liaoning, and even northern Jiangsu was entirely due to the CCP's adoption of an offensive strategy. Similarly, the CCP demanded democracy and repeatedly insisted on convening the National Assembly to draft a constitution and demanded the reorganization of the National Government and the Executive Yuan to establish a united national government; but when the government was about to reorganize the government and convene the National Assembly, the CCP's argument suddenly changed, first arguing about the number of government committee members and the exercise of veto power; later, it simply refused to submit the list of National Assembly representatives, so that the National Assembly, which was scheduled to open on May 5, could not be held as scheduled, and a new constitution could not be produced; later, the government decided to convene the National Assembly on November 12. The CCP has always expressed opposition, and no matter how much the government compromises and asks the CCP to participate, the CCP's attitude is stubborn and it will never participate under any conditions. Now the National Assembly has opened, the government still reserves its seats and hopes that it will wake up and submit a list of representatives at any time to participate in the National Assembly. However, the CCP is still obsessed and doing everything possible to undermine the success of the National Assembly, using all means. In its verbal propaganda, it calls the National Assembly "illegal" and declares that it will not recognize the future constitution; at the same time, in fact, it is hindering others from participating in the National Assembly. Now the CCP has gone a step further and is publicizing at home and abroad that the National Army is attacking Yan'an, trying to put the responsibility for the breakdown of peace talks and the outbreak of war entirely on the government.</p>
<p>In short, after reading the above comparison of facts, we know that no one except those with ulterior motives will believe the CCP's claim that the National Army is attacking Yan'an. The CCP's propaganda offensive is obviously going to fall "flat" again; but after reading the CCP's recent "frequent mobilizations" in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region, although the CCP claims to be "evacuating," it can also be seen that the CCP's propaganda offensive will be the prelude to its launch of a military offensive. The CCP's approach is only disappointing and tantamount to cutting itself off from the people of the country; we really feel sorry for the CCP. In fact, there are many enlightened people in the CCP, why must they take this step!</p>
<h3>The Promotion of Racial Equality</h3>
<p>——The Passage of the Egyptian Proposal</p>
<p>With the collapse of Fascism, the theory of superior nations is no longer valued. According to recent research by anthropologists, while there are differences in intelligence and foolishness among individuals in the world, there are no differences in superiority or inferiority between nations. According to a special cable from the CCP's New York correspondent on the 19th, the United Nations General Assembly held its first vote of 54 countries and unanimously passed the resolution proposed by Egypt, asking all governments to immediately stop religious and racial persecution and discrimination. Although the Egyptian proposal did not list facts or contribute concrete methods, the passage of this proposal, as the Indian representative said, is "a major step in affirming that all human beings are completely equal, regardless of whether they are white, black, or yellow."</p>
<p>Since there is no superiority or inferiority among races, they should enjoy equal treatment. Using the myth of a superior nation to bully the weak and the few is the style of European imperialism in the 19th century, and it is also the tyranny of the Fascist group. Although Fascism has failed, racial discrimination has not been completely eliminated. For example, the Union of South Africa has 60 laws restricting the freedom of Indians within its borders. Public buses, trains, post offices, and parks must be separated from Europeans everywhere. Two million Europeans can elect 150 parliamentary representatives, while 250,000 Indians can only elect three representatives, and the representatives must be Europeans. Another example is the Republic of the Philippines, since its establishment, has passed three types of bills regarding retailers, laborers, and market vendors, depriving overseas Chinese of the opportunity to survive, and refusing overseas Chinese from entering the Philippines. The military and police can arrest them at will, and the Ministry of the Interior even has a Chinatown plan. Actions such as this racial discrimination fundamentally violate the spirit of democracy.</p>
<p>The spirit of democracy should be freedom, equality, and fraternity. The policy of racial discrimination restricts freedom, cancels equality, and fundamentally does not talk about fraternity. Therefore, the Union of South Africa and the Republic of the Philippines cannot be considered true democratic countries. When the Egyptian proposal was passed, it was unanimously passed, and the only opponent was South African Prime Minister Smuts. Smuts recently also suggested to the United Nations Trusteeship Council that he wanted to annex Southwest Africa, and declared that if the United Nations Trusteeship Council did not pass it, he would take direct action. Smuts' undemocratic performance and imperialist style in the Union of South Africa will certainly be subject to the criticism and sanctions of world opinion. As for the Philippine representative, since he agreed to this proposal, he should no longer impose unfair oppression on overseas Chinese within the country in the future, and bills such as those regarding retailers, laborers, and market vendors can be avoided.</p>
<p>Europe has gone through a long period of religious wars, and today religious discrimination has long become a thing of the past. However, because of the different races, they often believe in different religions. Even within the same race, there may be different religious beliefs. Because of different religions, it often leads to fierce conflicts. This situation is particularly evident in India. The conflict between India and Islam has killed and injured tens of thousands of people to date. Even after the leader of the Muslims joined the provisional government, he could not stop the bloody fighting in various places. As for the Indians, because of religion, they are divided into five strictly different classes, among which the untouchable class is the most oppressed and never has the opportunity to turn over. These religious discriminations are the main factors causing internal disputes in India.</p>
<p>In the thousands of years of Chinese history, one thing that is worth our pride is that there has been no religious war. Although Confucian philosophy has been supported by successive governments, other religions have also coexisted. As for race, the Chinese sages, whether Confucian, Buddhist, or Taoist, all have the spirit of fraternity, equality, and freedom, and never advocate any discrimination. In the past, China was able to maintain a vast empire and preserve a long-standing culture, all thanks to this broad tolerance and a healthy outlook on life and the universe. Our chief representative Gu Weijun specially quoted Confucius's famous saying "All within the four seas are brothers" at the United Nations General Assembly, which won applause from the entire audience at the time. Professor Pei Fei from the United States gave a lecture at Tongji University in Shanghai a month ago, and also pointed out the relationship between Einstein's world and Confucius's world. The former world studies "people and things," while the latter world studies "people and people." According to Professor Pei Fei's view, the most serious problem in the world today is to study the relationship between "people and people." Human beings must live in harmony and must have the spirit of freedom, equality, and fraternity. The proposal of the Egyptian representative is the voice of human justice, and the unanimous agreement of 53 countries is also a harbinger of harmonious coexistence among human beings.</p>

<h3>Poor Sales and Rampant Usury: A Wave of Business Bankruptcies in Suzhou; Even Established Old Shops of Decades Struggle to Survive</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Suzhou, 21st] In recent days, a wave of business bankruptcies has swept through Suzhou like a sudden surge, and it is unstoppable. Specifically, more than ten shops, including Jinbu Qianzhuang, Xiehu Pihuo Hang, and Jiucheng Shan Hang, all long-established businesses with decades of operation, have closed down one after another. The losses are all over 100 million yuan, and people from all walks of life are worried about the future of commerce. On the 21st, our newspaper reporter paid a special visit to the person in charge of the County Chamber of Commerce to inquire about the statistics of business bankruptcies in the past two months and the causes of the problems. According to reports, from July to the end of September, the total number of business bankruptcies in this county has exceeded 460, including five gold and silver shops, four mountain goods shops, two automobile shops, four edible oil shops, nine oil and wine shops, five tea shops, five new medicine shops, five tea snack shops, eight Shaoxing wine shops, four foundry shops, seven wood shops, Guokeng steel shops, ten tung oilseed cake shops, twenty-eight cloth shops, three native cloth shops, three lime brick and tile shops, firewood shops, four transportation shops, eleven vegetable and rice restaurants, six preserved meat shops, 160 grain shops, 161 flour shops, and five flour mills that are also planning to close down. From October to the present, according to unofficial statistics, there are still more than 100 businesses from various industries that have closed down one after another. There are four main causes: (1) scarcity of raw materials, (2) poor sales, (3) high wages, and (4) usurious exploitation. There are also other minor factors, such as excessive taxation, which have also contributed to the accelerated collapse. At present, business people generally hope that the government can provide widespread low-interest loans to treat the symptoms and quickly plan for smooth transportation to treat the root cause. With both symptomatic and root causes treated, there may be a glimmer of hope for commercial and economic recovery.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper, Suzhou, 21st] The Jiangsu Provincial Government had previously ordered the counties under its jurisdiction to complete the review of public office candidates by the end of October in order to establish civil-constitutional organizations at all levels and begin elections. Since the deadline has passed for many days, only more than ten counties, including Jiangning and Wuxian, have complied. Such continued delays will indefinitely postpone the establishment of public opinion organizations. A disciplinary order has been issued to show vigilance, with Zhang Meng-tao, the county magistrate of Zhenjiang County, Sun Dan-xin, the county magistrate of Wujin County, Zhang Ding, the county magistrate of Gaochun County, and Xu Zhu-yi, the county magistrate of Jiading County, each receiving a demerit.

<h3>Public Trial of Sack Smuggling Case Held the Day Before Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Wuxi News] During the victory celebration last year, eight sack shops, including Demao on Beitang Jiyu Street, used armed force to smuggle 200,000 sacks from the enemy companies Mitsui and Sanmeng. Later, neighbor Zhu Yu-lin reported it to the local court, and the investigation involved Shen Dun-hui and Zhang Zai-hao, investigators from the Enemy Property Handling Bureau. Subsequently, the prosecutor's office summoned the owners of the eight sack shops and Shen and Zhang to the court for interrogation. Due to the seriousness of the suspicion, they were all released on bail. After investigation, the prosecutor believed that the eight shop owners had committed the crime of illegally occupying stolen goods, and the two investigators Shen and Zhang had committed the crime of assisting in illegal occupation. The prosecutor then filed a public prosecution with the criminal court of the same court. The 20th was the date for the first public trial of the case. The plaintiff Zhu Yu-lin, the witness Yuan Fu-nan, and the ten defendants, including Zhu Yu-lin, all complied with the summons and appeared in court to await trial. Judge Wu Shu-tang opened the court for trial. As a result, due to the complexity of the case, it still needs to be adjourned for continued questioning. The plaintiff and witnesses were all ordered to return, and the defendants were still released on bail awaiting trial.</p>
<h3>Ningbo Farmers' Association Demands Abolition of Sewage Contracting</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Ningbo News] The sewage of this county's urban area has always been handled by contractors. Over the years, the contractors have only sought to enrich themselves, disregarding public health, causing constant complaints from the local community. Local public organizations have repeatedly petitioned for improvements. It is now learned that the contractor's contract for this year expires at the end of this month. It is rumored that the contractors are secretly trying to continue the contract, and the County Health Affairs Committee also seems agreeable. The County Farmers' Association learned of this matter and held a special meeting of directors and supervisors yesterday to discuss it. It was resolved that contracting out to merchants would increase the burden on farmers, and the association expressed its opposition, demanding the abolition of the contractor system and its replacement by farmer operation. Chairman Hu was appointed to negotiate with the county government, along with Director Chen Yinglie.</p>
<h3>Anhui Province Tax Collection Situation: Disaster-Stricken Counties Granted Separate Reductions, Few Payments Made, Intensified Supervision Urged</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Hefei News] Our reporter recently learned the following about the collection of land tax in Anhui Province this year: (1) The total provincial tax quota is 12,972,395 silver dollars. According to the rate of three dou of grain collected per silver dollar, plus one dou of requisitioned military grain and nine sheng of provincial and county public grain, a total of 5,688,841 shi of grain (referring to rice) should be collected. Due to the late determination of the collection rate and the severe bandit and flood disasters in northeastern Anhui, as of the 10th of this month, the reported amount collected by various counties was only over 200,000 shi, far from the required amount. (2) Due to the disasters in Xuyi, Tianchang, Sixian, Lingbi, Fengyang, and Suxian counties in northeastern Anhui, the central government has approved temporary postponement of tax collection, totaling a reduction of over 600,000 shi of grain. (3) According to the collection situation in previous years, there are always cases of escaped, deceased, and impoverished households that cannot be collected, accounting for about 20% of the total tax amount. This year will likely be no exception, with an estimated reduction of 900,000 shi of grain. (4) This year, the area affected by floods and insect plagues in the province is very wide. In addition to northeastern Anhui, there are also Quanjiao, Hexian, Shucheng, Wujiang, Tongcheng, Taihu, Susong, Tongling, Qingyang, Jixi, Qimen, Dangtu, Langxi, Guangde, and Taiping counties, with an estimated reduction of 800,000 shi of grain. (5) The excessive collections in the 33rd year and the pre-borrowed military grain in the 34th year should be deducted from the new tax of this year to return to the people, approximately reducing the grain amount by over 400,000 shi. (6) After deducting the above-mentioned reduced grain amounts, the actual collection this year can reach over 2.9 million shi. (7) In this province, there are 19 districts including Yuexi, Zhide, Jingde, Ningguo, and Shouxian that use legal tender to offset grain collection. Among these 19 districts, either the whole district uses legal tender to offset, or a portion of the district does. The amount offset is equivalent to over 290,000 shi of grain. (8) The central government has set a deadline of the end of December to collect everything. With the deadline approaching, the Provincial Field and Grain Department has dispatched all staff to various districts to supervise the collection. The provincial government will also organize three roving supervision teams (headed by directors or committee members from various provincial departments) to set out for regional supervision and order each district to organize supervision teams, dividing responsibilities to ensure collective completion by the deadline, in order to achieve full collection on time. (9) To prevent corruption by grain administration personnel in various districts, supervisory committees are to be organized by district councils, party groups, and local impartial gentry to prevent problems from the outset.</p>

The first batch of recruits, one company of 196 men, is scheduled to be delivered on the 30th and will be received by a team from the Jiaxing Garrison District Command.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Jiangyin News] Cheng County was ordered to conscript, but still has a shortfall of 280 able-bodied men. The Wuxi Garrison District Command has repeatedly urged delivery, but the quota has not yet been met. The Garrison District Command believes that this matter concerns the entire conscription policy, so on the 20th, it specially sent the third section chief, Zang Xingwu, to Cheng to oversee the process, extending the deadline to the 25th.</p>

<h3>Inside Story of the Popular Rotating Savings and Credit Associations (標會) in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Reading the newspaper, I saw that the Municipal Council's Police Affairs Committee held its fourth meeting on the 16th of this month to discuss the prohibition of rotating savings and credit associations (標會). The councilors' opinions on the prohibition of 標會 were not fully detailed. The councilors come from the people, but unfortunately, they are somewhat out of touch with the people's hardships. It must be known that the harm of 標會 is worse than that of flower societies (花會), and the number of victims is in the tens of thousands. It is too late to try to crack down on it; prevention is better than cure. I, a humble member of the common people and a civil servant, often go into the community and have a more intimate understanding of the situation. I would like to outline the situation of 標會 in this city. These are facts recognized by millions of citizens, and they are absolutely true. I hope that the councilors of the Police Affairs Committee will take decisive action to eliminate this harm to the people. The lesson of Zhang Wu Po in Hankou is not far away; please do not dismiss this as alarmist talk.</p>
<p>(1) Idlers Solicit Association, Heavy Interest Exaction Since the victory of the War of Resistance, the practice of 標會 in this city has become extremely popular. A class of unemployed idlers has arisen, relying on their evil influence to forcibly solicit association and act as the head of the association (會首), turning the collected association funds into high-interest loans (俗稱 印子錢). For example, if an association has 100 members, each person contributes 100,000 yuan for the first payment, totaling 10 million yuan. The head of the association receives this initial income and lends it to others, earning at least 3 jiao and at most 6 jiao of interest per yuan per month. In short, at least 3 million yuan of illegal profit can be earned per 10 million yuan. 標會 are held once a month, and only 100,000 yuan needs to be paid each time. This kind of business with no capital is easy to do, so idlers who used to lack food and clothing have suddenly become nouveau riche, living in luxury and splendor, envied by everyone. Not only are poor civil servants unable to keep up, but even wealthy families sigh that they cannot match it.</p>
<p>(2) Absconding with Funds, Utterly Devoid of Conscience Since the practice of 標會 has become popular for a time, where there are great profits, the masses follow suit. You solicit my association, and I solicit yours, becoming association principals (寶主) in turn, continuously and endlessly. In teahouses and restaurants, one only hears the sound of 標會. The authorities have never stopped it. The amount of 標會 funds is surprisingly large. Because idlers who win the funds can profit from high-interest loans, they are willing to bid high. Therefore, each idler, according to their ability, pulls together to become an association head, with each person having at most ten-odd associations and participating in at least dozens of other people's associations. By collecting the initial association fee (頭會) and the bidded funds (標會), they absorb cash in astonishing amounts. Once their goal is achieved, they develop bad intentions and announce the collapse of the association (倒會). These people have neither permanent jobs nor permanent property, so they take everything they have and flee.</p>
<p>(3) Women of Good Families Suffer the Most Since the huge fraud case of Zhang Wu Po in Hankou, the idler-organized 標會 in this city have begun to waver. From August of this year to the present, every association formed by idlers has collapsed. There is some interaction among the idlers, and the debts from the collapsed associations can be offset. The most miserable are the women of ordinary families, who usually scrimp and save, even borrowing money to participate in the association. Once the association collapses, a lifetime of hard work is lost. When you ask them for money, they say that even banks are closing and shops must shut down, let alone small 標會. When you report to the authorities, the officials say, "Who told you to join the association? We don't care." As a result, the victims have nowhere to cry for help, and some have committed suicide out of grief and indignation. Moreover, these idlers are all shameless people. Once they see that the government doesn't care, they naturally become bolder. At first, they would go out to avoid the storm, but later, they would come out in the open. What can you do to them? They also hide their property and pretend to be poor, and you can't do anything to them!</p>
<p>(4) Treat the Symptoms Urgently, Severely Punish the Association Heads "A life for a life, debt must be repaid," as the ancient saying goes, still holds true today. Rogues use their evil influence to defraud people of their wealth, exact heavy interest, and do not have to risk their lives to seize huge sums of money. Their methods are ruthless and more harmful than bandits who rob with open fire! Prohibiting 標會 can only prevent problems before they occur. Now, accept reports from the people, immediately detain the rogue association heads, severely punish them according to the crime of robbery, and order them to hand over the hidden property to compensate the victims. At the same time, strictly prohibit 標會, so that both the root and the symptoms are treated (ordinary citizens who are forced to solicit associations due to poor turnover are an exception). If we only discuss banning 標會 and ignore the existing associations, it would be like dropping a pot and not caring about it. Why bother trying to lock the stable door after the horse has bolted? Therefore, treating the symptoms now is urgently needed.</p>
<p>Finally, police authorities and councilor gentlemen, please have great compassion and use the power of a thunderbolt to take back the people's wealth from the hands of the thugs? (Citizen Xu Wu)</p>
<h3>A Tragedy of an Old Father Being Killed</h3>
<p>I am from Gugao Town, Fifth District, Taixian County, Northern Jiangsu. Since the bandits and communists occupied the area, my family has been impoverished. In May of this year, they divided all of our fields and property. The people in my family fled to relatives' homes to take refuge. (I was originally the principal of the Songjiang County Central School, but later, because my wife fled, I could not maintain a living, so I came to Shanghai to work in a private school.) Today, I received a terrible message that the bandits and communists shot my loyal and cowardly 50-year-old father for no reason! My father, Gu Guilin, is a well-known honest man in the village. Dividing his property was not enough; they had to shoot my father. Such a policy of the communists is utterly devoid of conscience. Please publish this actual situation to seek justice for this bloody injustice. (Gu Rubo)</p>

<h3>Mine Workers' Contract Expired Last Night, US Coal Mines Prepare for General Strike, Labor Federation Expresses Determination to Back Them, Army Ordered to Coal Mining Areas to Maintain Order</h3>
<p>[United Press International, Washington, 21st] The 400,000 coal miners in the United States are scheduled to begin their second major strike at midnight today. Now that the deadline has passed by one minute, Miners Union leader Lewis still insists on his principle of "no contract, no work" and has shown no signs of retreating. According to officials, the strike will reduce industrial production and force factories with no coal storage to shut down.</p>
<p>[Reuters, New York, 21st] President Truman, who is currently on vacation, has ordered Attorney General Clark to issue a subpoena to Lewis after the miners went on strike at midnight yesterday because their leader Lewis refused to withdraw his notice of termination of the contract, accusing him of contempt of court and sentencing him accordingly. Whether the miners will actually go on strike will only be determined when the day shift begins work at 11 a.m. this morning (7 p.m. Shanghai time), as night shift workers account for only a very small proportion.</p>
<p>[United Press International, Washington, 20th] Miners Union President Lewis refused to comply with the government's strike ban today, so a general strike is brewing in the nation's bituminous coal mines, with 132,550 miners already on strike. According to Lewis's announcement, the miners' contract expires at midnight today, at which time 400,000 miners nationwide will be affected. Government authorities met today, but it is not yet known whether Lewis will be arrested and imprisoned or whether other measures will be taken. Some government officials are deeply concerned that Lewis's imprisonment will incite a general demonstration by the union.</p>
<p>[United Press International, Washington, 20th] The Department of the Army is prepared to send troops to the coal mines within hours at the request of the Secretary of the Interior. This action by the army is likely to be a police task.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Atlantic City, 20th] Regarding the US government's attitude towards Miners Union President Lewis, US Labor Federation President Green commented that even if the government uses bayonets or imprisonment to intimidate workers, it will not be able to make the miners produce a ton of coal. Any attempt to use force against the miners will only arouse sympathy for the strike from other unions affiliated with the Labor Federation. It is improper for the government not to submit the current dispute to the Department of Labor or the Arbitration Board for resolution. It has been announced that the Congress of Industrial Organizations has declared that its affiliated unions are pledged to support the miners. The two major labor groups in the United States have joined hands to support Lewis in an effort to crush the government's attempt to prevent the coal mine strike, as can be seen from this. According to well-informed sources, the US government has begun to fight the unions to the end.</p>
<h3>Foreign Troops Issue Reopened, US Representative Connally's Sharp Words, Rebuttal to Molotov's Speech</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Lake Success, New York, 21st] British Foreign Secretary Bevin is expected to reply to Molotov's request yesterday to investigate foreign troops in the Political Committee of the General Assembly today. A spokesman for the US delegation said that although the United States is willing to report the number of foreign troops, it does not include the number of naval and air force troops. However, both Britain and the United States believe that if the Military Staff Committee needs information, then this information should include reports on all foreign troops, including garrisons.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Lake Success, New York, 20th] Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov suddenly appeared at the Political Committee of the General Assembly today, expressing his views on the issue of troops stationed in non-enemy countries. He pointed out that under certain circumstances, the stationing of foreign troops in non-enemy countries is a method of interfering in the internal affairs of that country. He believes that Allied troops should not be stationed in Allied countries unless it is necessary to maintain transportation. He further pointed out that although Soviet troops have withdrawn from China, Norway, Yugoslavia, and Iran, British and American troops are still stationed in non-enemy countries in Europe, Asia, and South America. Molotov then suggested that the General Assembly ask the Security Council to request the member states of the United Nations to submit the following reports within one month: (1) In which non-enemy territories do member states have troops stationed, and how many? (2) In which former enemy territories do member states have troops stationed, and how many? (3) Where are the garrisons and naval defenses that member states have previously and recently established located? Molotov said that there are still a small number of Soviet troops in Poland to maintain transportation lines to Germany, and that Soviet troops in northern Korea are stationed in accordance with agreements with Allied countries. In contrast, British and American troops are still stationed in various parts of Europe, Asia, and South America long after the war has ended, and their air bases are even more densely distributed around the world, and some countries feel particularly interested in the two poles. The Soviet government suggested to the Security Council within eight days that member states submit reports on the stationing of troops in non-enemy territories. The Soviet Union is willing to fulfill this obligation and hopes that other countries will also agree to seek the common interests of the world.</p>
<p>US Representative Connally then spoke, solemnly denying that the stationing of US troops in other countries has caused unease. He stated that the number of US troops stationed abroad was 5 million at the end of the war, but has now been reduced to 800,000. Connally, only two chairs away from Molotov, slammed the table at the end of his speech and said, "We want the world to know where our troops are stationed, because wherever our troops are stationed, there is no threat to world peace. They carry the white flag of promoting a peaceful and united agreement to improve international welfare." Connally also demanded that the investigation of stationed troops should include all troops in the world. He said that soldiers carrying bayonets, whether in their own country or in a foreign country, are a threat to peace. Finally, British representative Cadogan expressed his opinion, "I believe that the draft resolution proposed by the Soviet representative is limited to armed forces stationed abroad, which is not sufficient. Therefore, I propose establishing a Staff Committee to collect all information on this issue."</p>

<h3>The Northern Border of Greece: Fierce Fighting Continues, Guerrillas Appear to Receive Foreign Support</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, New York, 21st] The Greek intelligence officer stationed in the United States issued last night the official report of his government regarding the border conflict, stating briefly that, from September 9th to November 19th of this year, Greek territory was attacked by guerrillas a total of 33 times. This kind of aggression is an undeclared war and endangers peace. The guerrilla thugs come from the two countries of South Bulgaria and Albania, perhaps with the tacit consent of those governments.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Athens, 20th] Authoritative sources claim: The Greek government intends to appeal directly to the UN General Assembly regarding foreign interference in the Greek civil war, according to Article 14 of the United Nations Charter, and does not intend to directly negotiate with Yugoslavia, Bulgaria or Albania in advance. It is understood that the rebel army making trouble in Greece comes from the Lialun area on the southern border of Greece, and they invaded a village in Macedonia again yesterday. Fierce fighting at Skrach is still ongoing. General Fantoulis, commander of the Greek Third Army, who is supervising the battle there, has ordered the establishment of large artillery teams at the Greek border outposts, especially in the Douralen area, to prevent new offensives from that direction.</p>

<h3>Investigation Report on Japanese Reparations: Two Accompanying Statements by Pauley; Actual Situation Awaits Adjustment by Implementing Agencies; Labor Compensation and Repeated Compensation Are Both Opposed</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 20th] According to State Department sources today: The final report submitted by Edwin Pauley, the special envoy for investigating Japanese reparations, to President Truman is still under review by the White House. It is said that Pauley stated several points in the report: (1) The mission of the investigation was to determine the policy on Japanese reparations. In order to fulfill this mission, the investigation team focused only on collecting information on various broad categories of the Japanese economy and studying those most relevant to reparations. These property inventories and their records were either provided directly by the Japanese side or by MacArthur's headquarters. No review was added to the details, so once implemented, there will inevitably be some inconsistencies between the actual situation of comprehensive reparations and the detailed plans. This will be the responsibility of the reparations implementing agency to adjust. For example, deciding on the demilitarization of Japan and comprehensive reparations as principles, but without sufficient input to continue manufacturing goods for export, Japanese industry will not be able to operate. When deciding on reparations policies, arrangements can be made in advance, but it is difficult to pre-specify every detail. Regarding this level of detail, Japan must be ordered to report in detail in the future, and if there are any false reports or concealment, appropriate penalties should be imposed. (2) Pauley opposes labor compensation and repeated compensation. The countries demanding compensation already have a surplus of labor. If Japan sends out workers again, it will greatly affect the level of labor and living standards in Asian countries, which urgently need to be raised. As for repeated compensation, it is bound to first develop Japanese industry, fattening the hen, and then continuously taking eggs. In this way, after the compensation is paid off continuously, Japan can retain its surplus industry, convert it for military use, and compete in foreign markets, threatening the industrialization of neighboring countries. It is extremely dangerous to nurture future problems, and it is necessary to prevent them in advance.</p>
<h3>Japanese Land Reform Implemented Yesterday</h3>
<p>One-Fifth of the Nation's Tenant Farmers Can Farm Their Own Land</p>
<p>[Kaizo-sha, Tokyo, 21st] The Japanese Land Reform Law was implemented today. Land problem expert Yekinskit from MacArthur's headquarters made a statement, saying: The Japanese government submitted a farmland reform plan to the headquarters on March 15th of this year, but it was rejected due to the following shortcomings: (1) It was excessive for landlords to be allowed to retain five cho-bu (12.25 acres), which would leave 60% of the existing tenant farmers' land unaffected; (2) There were no countermeasures against excessively high rents; (3) The stipulated implementation period of five years was too long and unnecessary; (4) Entrusting the implementation of the reform to local officials would inevitably lead to bias in favor of landlords' interests and unfairness. However, the amended reform law has made great progress and is a far-reaching measure to alleviate the long-standing poverty and insecurity of Japanese farmers. Land ownership will see widespread distribution, and one-fifth of Japanese tenant farmers will be able to farm their own land. There are thorough measures to prevent illegal activities.</p>
<h3>India Strictly Enforces Tobacco Ban</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, New Delhi, 20th Dispatch] The Indian government has decided to completely ban the smoking of opium in India. The exception is for those who are currently addicted to opium, who may continue to smoke it for the rest of their lives, provided they have a certificate from a examining doctor during this period. Some provinces that are absolutely prohibited from smoking opium are not affected by this decision. Seventy-five princely states in India have already or are in the process of absolutely prohibiting opium smoking within the state. According to the 1912 Hague Convention, the Indian government should implement a policy of prohibiting opium smoking.</p>

<h3>"Without Air Defense, There is No National Defense": Party, Government, and Military Leaders Gave Warning Speeches at Yesterday's Air Defense Festival Commemorative Meeting; Families of Fallen Airmen Speechless with Grief</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Yesterday was the 7th Air Defense Festival. At 9:00 AM, an air raid siren was sounded, and at the same time, the Air Defense Festival Commemorative Meeting was held at the Great Light Grand Theater, with Guo Guozhen, Xuan Tiewu, Fang Zhi, Cao Jun, Gu Chunfan, Zhu Ping, Li Ximou, Xu Caicheng, Wang Shenshan, and others as the presidium. More than a thousand people attended, including family members of air defense personnel, family members of fallen compatriots, representatives from various agencies, and guests. Mayor Wu, as chairman, briefly stated: Holding the Air Defense Festival here today, I feel deeply moved. Recalling my time in Chongqing, witnessing the fierce bombing by enemy planes, I felt extremely angry and deeply realized that to defend our territory, we must have a strong air force. After this long war of attrition, the motherland's vitality has not yet recovered, and expanding the air force cannot be achieved overnight, so we should at least prepare for passive air defense. Shanghai is located on the coast and has a dense population. If an air raid occurs, the consequences would be disastrous. For the sake of preparedness, future buildings in this city must be coordinated with air defense facilities, such as building underground tunnels. Therefore, at this time and in this place, commemorating the Air Defense Festival should especially remind citizens of the saying "Think of danger in times of safety" and "Preparedness ensures no calamity." We must strengthen our attention and vigilance towards air defense. Fang Zhi then delivered a speech, briefly stating: In modern times, with the development of science and technology in various countries, the international distance is becoming shorter and shorter. During our country's eight years of resistance against Japan, we suffered heavy losses from enemy air raids, and we began to realize the importance of air defense. "Without air defense, there is no national defense." Although the war has ended, we must pay attention to air defense for self-defense. Wu Zhi then delivered a speech, saying that after World War I, the air force has been fully utilized and has made great strides. The power of the bombing of Iwo Jima and Nagasaki is proof of this. Therefore, to talk about national defense, we must first talk about air defense. Before the invaders are eradicated, no one can guarantee that there will be no war in the world, so strengthening air defense is extremely urgent. Finally, Wang Weimin, commander of the Air Force Supply Department, made three points: (1) Citizens must receive air defense training; (2) They must have sufficient knowledge of the use of air defense tools; (3) Citizens must receive organizational training, and the air defense organization must be strict. The meeting ended at about 11:00 AM with music.</p>
<p>In addition, Ms. Zhang Ruizhi, a family member of an air force martyr, requested to express her opinions at the closing of the meeting, but she was unable to do so due to being overwhelmed with emotion. After the meeting, Mayor Wu, Commander Xuan, and others hosted a tea party for the 24 families of air force martyrs who died in Shanghai during the war. Family members of air force martyrs raised the following points: (1) Children's education expenses; (2) Housing issues; (3) Living expenses; (4) The remains of the martyrs cannot be transported back to their hometowns. Mayor Wu promised to convene relevant agencies to discuss these issues and report them to the Air Force Headquarters for condolence. The relief items collected from all parties for the meeting are currently being collected by the local association. Once collected, they will be sent directly to the families of the fallen martyrs. In addition, in order to promote aviation and national construction and increase people's aviation knowledge, the Air Force Supply Command has placed a 100 kg bomb in each of the four locations: the Bund, the Great World, Cade Road, and in front of Jing'an Temple for citizens to visit. At 9:30 AM, the Aviation Commission also sent planes to scatter air defense leaflets in the city.</p>

<h3>American Businessmen's Feelings About the New Trade Regulations: Whether It Will Be Effective Depends on Whether the Methods Can Be Followed; Hope to Support Exporters</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] A reporter recently interviewed an authoritative American exporter in this city to ask for his views on the recently promulgated revised trade regulations. He said: In principle, the regulations are very sound, especially in the point of economizing on China's foreign exchange, which is particularly necessary. However, whether the regulations can be effectively implemented depends on whether everyone can abide by the regulations. If the regulations can be implemented in an impartial spirit, they will definitely be a stabilizing factor for China's economy. Let's take a few examples to illustrate this. In the past, legitimate importing firms operated their businesses steadily. However, speculators, enjoying the same import rights, sold all kinds of imported goods at high prices. This was most evident in goods such as automobiles and milk powder. Legitimate importing firms, although subject to allocation quotas, maintained the lowest possible prices for various imported goods in order to maintain their current minimum operating expenses. However, the prices set by speculators were often three or four times the reasonable sales price. If the revised trade regulations cannot limit the allocation of imported goods to stable importing firms, then similar situations will continue to occur.</p>
<p>However, the new regulations seem to have completely forgotten about exporters. China should encourage exports at present. Exporters are currently unable to profit from export businesses due to high domestic costs. The government should especially plan to assist stable exporters. The foreign exchange earned by exporters must be converted to the government at the official rate, and the actual return for each US dollar converted is only 75 cents. However, the purchasing power of legal tender in this city is purely based on its black market price. Therefore, the difference between the black market and the official exchange rate invisibly causes exporters to lose 25% of the value of their conversions. This loss is bound to be borne by overseas buyers, which increases the cost of exports invisibly. How can they make a profit if they want to be profitable? Currently, most exporters in this city have fallen into a state of semi-shutdown, and staff has been reduced to the minimum number. Some stable exporters have even completely ceased operations. If the authorities allow stable exporters to import goods of equal value to the foreign exchange they convert to designated banks, it would be of great help. This move would have two important meanings: (1) Exporters can still maintain their business from import income; (2) In some cases, even though exporters' export businesses are losing money, they are still willing to continue operating in the hope of offsetting this export loss with the profits earned from imports.</p>

<h3>Nurses Going to the U.S. for Internships to Return Home Next Spring After the End of Their Term</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] In order to send nurses abroad to the United States for training, the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) previously selected nurses from China, Australia, Czechoslovakia, Greece, Poland, and Yugoslavia to send to the United States.

<h3>The Case of Demolishing Houses Protruding into Main Roads: The Public Works Bureau Plans to Come up with Alternative Solutions</h3>
<p>The Public Works Committee of the former Municipal Senate suggested to the Municipal Government's Public Works Bureau to demolish the houses next to bottleneck roads in the central district to facilitate traffic. It has been more than a month, but the Public Works Bureau has been reluctant to act rashly, considering that although this move would benefit pedestrians, it would cause great damage to the homeowners. In the current situation where everything is waiting to be rebuilt, there should be detailed consideration. It is understood that the bureau still intends to do so because it was assigned by the Senate, in order not to violate the will of the public opinion organ. However, it is now planned that for buildings next to bottleneck roads that are more than 20 years old, a portion will be demolished and a portion will be retained. Residents or businesses can demolish the protruding portion. If the new house was built within 20 years, or if there is no remaining space to live in after demolition, it will be temporarily retained. The suggestion will be sent to the Public Works Committee of the Senate for approval before implementation.</p>
<h3>The U.S. Side Begins to Take Back Blood Plasma, Nearly 40,000 Units Stored in 19 Warehouses, Will Still Use Pharmaceuticals to Compensate Lida Trading Company</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] After the blood plasma problem was satisfactorily resolved the day before yesterday, the inventory stored in the various warehouses of Lida International Trading Company began to be taken back by the U.S. side yesterday afternoon. The reporter drove to Ruifeng Warehouse on Tianzhutang Street at about 1:00 PM and saw more than 20 U.S. Navy personnel and several giant trucks parked in the open space inside the fence. Soon, Lieutenant Colonel Anderson of the U.S. Surplus Property Disposal Committee, Schmidt from the Public Information Group, and representatives from the U.S. Consulate General, the U.S. Navy, and the person in charge of Lida Trading Company arrived one after another. The blood plasma was stored in the fourth-floor warehouse, and eight laborers hired by the company moved it downstairs, and then the U.S. Navy loaded it onto trucks. The blood plasma packaging is a rectangular cardboard box, measuring 2.6 cubic feet, weighing 73 pounds, with the words "Normal Human Plasma, 12 Dried Packages" printed on the box.</p>
<p>There are a total of 218 boxes in this warehouse, each box containing 12 packages of 500cc units, totaling more than 2,600 units. All of them were signed for receipt by Lieutenant Colonel Anderson, loaded onto trucks, and driven to the naval warehouse for storage. Then they continued to extract from other warehouses of Lida Trading Company.</p>
<p>According to the person in charge of Lida Trading Company, there are a total of more than 39,000 units of blood plasma stored in 19 warehouses. Therefore, the U.S. side may not be able to clear all of them in half a day yesterday. As for the physical objects used as payment, they are mostly pharmaceuticals, which the company will choose after the U.S. side provides a list of items.</p>
<h3>Anesthetic Discovered After Blood Plasma, Investigation is Underway Regarding Sales in the City</h3>

At the same time, the committee has informed the U.S. Navy and the Consulate General of this matter, and the U.S. Consulate General has informed the Chinese authorities, and the national authorities are now taking appropriate action."</p>
<h3>A Madman Playing with Fire Burns Himself to Death; Three Fires in Pudong and the South City</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] At about 2:00 AM yesterday morning, Yang Gengsheng, a resident of No. 36 Tiedianqiao, near Qichangzhan in Pudong, who was suffering from madness, caused a fire by playing with a kerosene lamp, which ignited the house. The fire was fierce for two hours. Later, the Pudong Fire Department drove to the scene to extinguish the fire, which was extinguished at 4:00 AM.

<h3>Insurance Policies with Stamp Tax Duplication, Insurance Industry Asks for Amendment, Ministry of Finance Agrees to Consider; Luo Beichen Talks After Going to Nanjing for Instructions</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Luo Beichen, chairman of the National Federation of Insurance Commerce, recently went to Nanjing to consult the Direct Taxation Department and the Counselor's Office of the Ministry of Finance on the issue of affixing stamps to insurance policies. He told reporters: "The current issue of affixing stamps to insurance policies is mainly one of tax duplication. As far as insurance policies are concerned, the proportional taxation of insurance policies and contracts in our country is a duplication. We are now requesting that insurance policies be affixed with stamps according to ordinary contracts, while insurance premium receipts be affixed with stamps according to the proportional taxation method, to show fairness. Secondly, as far as reinsurance documents are concerned, the original insurer has already affixed the full amount of stamps, and if reinsurance documents are affixed with stamps again, it would be even more of a duplication. In addition, for term insurance, stamps should be calculated and affixed on a daily basis. For non-fixed-term transportation insurance policies, stamps should be affixed for a period of 15 days (because according to the average estimate of the insurance industry, the date consumed by various transportation lines in China is mostly within 15 days), but usually they are affixed for a full year, so the premium income for insurance businesses with short terms is often insufficient to cover the cost of affixing stamps. If the above points can be improved, there will be no loss to the government's tax revenue, and for the insurance industry, it will remove a 'heavy burden.' It is heard that the authorities of the Ministry of Finance believe that there is considerable reason for the points raised by Luo and have agreed to consider making amendments."</p>
<h3>Legal Interpretation Regarding UNRRA Personnel's Smuggling and Tax Evasion Case</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] At the beginning of this month, UNRRA personnel Kaiyi brought a large number of goods on a ship from the Philippines to Shanghai in an attempt to smuggle and evade taxes and was detained by the police bureau and handed over to the district prosecutor's office. However, the district court, in view of the fact that the basic agreement signed between our country and UNRRA stated that "UNRRA personnel, when performing official duties, are exempt from any form of legal summons for actions within the scope of their duties," and that on October 17th of this year, the Shanghai District Court ruled against the acceptance of a case against Hayes, the general manager of UNRRA's Zhenru Machinery Factory, for allegedly excavating and occupying a burial site, based on the agreement, the district court consulted the Ministry of Justice on whether to accept the Kaiyi smuggling and tax evasion case. Yesterday, the Ministry of Justice's interpretation order arrived, giving two points of instruction regarding this case: (1) UNRRA personnel's crimes, except for actions related to their duties, cannot enjoy extraterritoriality; (2) The Provisional Regulations on Punishing Smuggling and Evasion of Customs Duties promulgated by the National Government on July 4th of the 25th year of the Republic of China are no longer applicable, and smuggling and tax evasion should be handled in accordance with the Customs Anti-Smuggling Regulations. If the case meets the provisions of Articles 1 and 3, Paragraph 1 of the Regulations on Punishing Corruption, the court may still accept it.</p>

<h3>Government Agencies and Troops Occupying Enemy and Puppet Properties; Garrison Command Ordered to Enforce Eviction; Letter Sent to the Processing Bureau for Joint Handling</h3>
<p>Enemy and puppet property houses were previously auctioned by the China Trust Bureau on behalf of the Processing Bureau. The Processing Bureau submitted a request to President Song of the Executive Yuan regarding enemy and puppet property houses in this city, instructing the Songhu Garrison Command to enforce eviction to facilitate sales. This measure has been approved by President Song. The Songhu Garrison Command received this order the other day, stating: Commander Xuan Tiewu previously enforced the eviction of soldiers who forcibly occupied civilian houses, which was quite effective. Currently, the enemy and puppet property houses occupied by various government agencies and troops in this city are also the responsibility of the command to enforce eviction, and so on. It is reported that Commander Xuan, after receiving the order, reported to the Ministry of National Defense for inspection. He also directly requested the Enemy and Puppet Property Processing Bureau of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui to dispatch a specialist to the command for joint handling.</p>
<h3>Xin Nianyang Specialize in Stealing Mailbags and Letters; Impersonating to Commit Fraud</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] Huang Yinsheng (33 years old, from Suzhou, residing at 505 Henan Middle Road) and his friend Zhong Shusheng (27 years old, residing at 102, Lane 759, Tiantong Road), along with Huang's apprentice Jin Shuren (age and origin unknown), colluded to commit fraud. Huang specialized in stealing letters from mailbags when postmen parked their vehicles. He then approached Tan Yulin of the Hualian Cigarette Shop at 1224 Zhongzheng East Road, using the content of the letters to concoct counterfeit medicine, which Zhong Shusheng and Jin Shuren delivered, defrauding him of 150,000 legal tender. The second victim was Fan Wentian, 45 years old, from Tianjin, residing at 85 Lianyungang Road, who was also defrauded of 94,000 yuan on September 20th using letters. The third victim was Li Rongzi (female), 42 years old, residing at 8, Lane 5, Fanshili, Muming Road, who was defrauded of 96,000 yuan. The fourth victim was Jiang Dingyuan, residing at 24, Lane 505, Chengdu Road, who was defrauded of 96,000 yuan. The total amount defrauded in the four incidents was 496,000 legal tender. At 10 PM on the 14th, Huang attempted the same trick again, stealing letters from a mailbag placed by a postman next to the Qingxuguan wall at 721 Zhongzheng East Road. This was witnessed by a volunteer policeman No. 1925, who apprehended him and took him to the Postal Bureau on Carter Road. Inspector Xu Zuiyi, Lin Decheng, and the victim postman No. 726 sent him to the Xincheng Branch for interrogation, where he confessed the above. The police then dispatched staff members Weng Yongquan and Pan Zhipeng to arrest his accomplices Zhong Shusheng and Jin Shuren. They confessed to helping out, claiming they only received 40,000 yuan and 20,000 yuan respectively. After preliminary examination, the facts were confirmed, and they will be transferred to the judicial authorities for trial in the coming days.</p>

<h3>Talking about Fire Prevention in the Fire Season; Shanghai's Equipment is Nationally Ranked First; Day and Night Alertness and Swift Action; Full Departure Within Half a Minute</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] Fire, this mysterious thing, is the driving force of all power. Without it, from personal daily life to the industrial construction of a country, everything would become impossible. Since the ancient times when Suiren discovered "fire," it has brought immeasurable benefits and help to people, but the disasters of fire have also followed. "A single spark can start a prairie fire." Do not underestimate that single spark; it can destroy a family, a village, a city. It can turn billions of dollars of property into ashes in an instant, and it can make tens of thousands of people homeless.</p>
<p>People living in cities see robbery and kidnapping cases in the newspapers every day, only knowing that a certain family has been robbed of so many jewels and property, or that someone has spent hundreds of thousands of US dollars on ransom, and think that the amount of loss is considerable, but they know that the loss from fire is truly terrifying! According to the statistics of the authorities, from the time of receiving the property last year to the present, the losses from various criminal cases, including theft, kidnapping, robbery, and various crimes, amounted to more than 2 billion yuan, while the losses from fire alarms amounted to more than 3 billion yuan, exceeding it by about one-third!</p>
<p>Furthermore, robbery and theft mean that the materials still exist, but fire will destroy the materials. Usually, we only know that the police protect our lives and property, but we do not know that the fire brigade occupies an even more important position, because only it can "eliminate" and "prevent" fire, greatly reducing the power of fire.</p>
<p>The world's first fire brigade was in London, the capital of England. As early as the beginning of the 19th century, several insurance companies, in order to prevent fire damage to customers who had purchased fire insurance, established a small fire-fighting organization within the company. This was the beginning of the fire brigade. Later, after the Great Fire of London, the municipal authorities, fearing the lessons of the past, formed a fire brigade with public funds. At this time, countries around the world, seeing the importance of the fire brigade, formed them one after another.</p>
<p>The first fire brigade in our country began with the Beijing Police Department, and later other places also established them one after another. However, limited by technology and funding, compared with foreign fire-fighting organizations, it was like a newborn baby. The more comprehensive one is the fire brigade of the current Shanghai Police Bureau, which is second to none in China and is a model for the whole country. In order to understand the detailed organizational situation, the reporter made a visit to Section Chief Ye of the Second Section of the brigade.</p>
<p>Fire Control Room</p>
<p>There are a total of seven fire brigades in Shanghai, and the one at the intersection of Henan Road is the most comprehensive. After any fire alarm occurs in this city, it is immediately transferred to the fire control room, which is located on the second floor of the Municipal Government Building, where two people work day and night. Every minute, every second, they sit in front of the phone number 15183, ready to serve people at any time. Their only hope is that when the unfortunate people frantically ask the fire brigade for help, they hope that they can maintain the last bit of calm and must report the name of the street where the fire occurred, as well as the intersection and house number in detail. If the fire location is in an apartment, it is even more necessary to report the floor and room number clearly. The most ideal thing is to report the type of building, such as a building, bungalow, store, or factory. This is of great help to the work of the fire brigade, such as the allocation of fire trucks. It can directly help the fire scene to be rescued early.</p>
<p>Always Ready to Go</p>
<p>The life of a firefighter, in the eyes of ordinary people, is undoubtedly extraordinarily tense. They spend all day in the fire brigade, always ready to go. As long as the alarm rings, they can all be dispatched within 30 seconds. If the fire alarm is in the middle of the night, they will immediately jump out of bed, step out of the window, and slide down the copper pole to the floor below. Because their dormitory is upstairs, in order to save the time of walking up the stairs, each window has a copper pole, and every well-trained firefighter can rely on this to go up and down freely. The firefighters' clothes are all placed on the fire truck, so they all put on their clothes after getting into the truck.</p>
<p>Mostly Due to Negligence</p>
<p>Fire is certainly terrible, but it can be prevented. Because most fires are caused by people's negligence. To prevent fires, you must first know how fires occur.</p>
<p>The biggest causes of fire are nothing more than the following three categories: (1) Human error: due to laziness and neglect, people do not pay attention or be careful on weekdays. (2) Human intent - deliberate fraud and revenge, spies, etc., deliberately arson. (3) Spontaneous combustion - due to the sunlight during the day, the friction of machines, lightning, and other factors, flammable materials ignite spontaneously.</p>
<p>Except for categories (2) and (3), most fires are due to people's negligence.</p>
<p>Winter is the "fire season." After the beginning of winter, the weather gradually becomes cold, the climate becomes dry, and the wind will be stronger. Every household lights a fire to keep warm, and the chance of fire is even greater. But let the reporter repeat again, "fire" can be prevented, as long as you are careful and cautious on weekdays!</p>
<h3>Yu Qiaqing's Coffin Arrives in Shanghai Tomorrow; Grand Funeral to be Held the Day After Tomorrow Morning</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] Mr. Yu Qiaqing, a prominent figure from Zhenhai living in Shanghai and the owner of the Sanbei Shipping Company, passed away in the wartime capital during the War of Resistance. His coffin is now being transported back to Shanghai. The company dispatched the Ruitai ship to Yichang to transport it. The ship carrying the coffin departed from Yichang on the 6th. After arriving in Wuhan, it was publicly mourned by various groups and a funeral was held. It departed from Wuhan on the 14th. Public mourning ceremonies were held in Jiujiang, Wuhu, Nanjing, and other places. It is learned that the coffin-transporting ship passed Zhenjiang and headed east at 1 PM yesterday, anchored in Jiangyin last night, and set sail for Shanghai this morning. It is expected to arrive at Wusongkou around the evening, anchored at Songkou overnight, and will enter the port tomorrow morning (the 23rd). It is estimated that it will dock at Pier 13 at 2 PM tomorrow (the 23rd). All levels of staff of Sanbei Company will go to the pier to greet it at that time, and a public mourning ceremony will be held on the ship that night. The coffin will remain on the ship for another night, and the funeral will be held at 8 AM on the 24th. At 2 PM, ten groups will hold a public mourning ceremony and a memorial service. According to news from the preparatory office, more than a thousand pieces of elegiac couplets, scrolls, and banners have been received from all walks of life. During the funeral, various groups will donate ceremonial guards. The route of the funeral procession has been slightly changed because the Ningbo Fellow Association has prepared a grand roadside memorial ceremony. The coffin will be carried ashore from the ship at 8 AM, passing Nanjing Road westward, to Lloyd Road northward, Zhifu Road westward, Xizang Road southward, passing the Fellow Association all the way south, to the intersection of Xizang South Road and Linsen East Road, turning into Minguo Road to the Siming Guildhall. A colorful memorial arch has been set up at Pier 13 on the Bund yesterday to welcome the coffin.</p>
<h3>Old Man Qiaqing's Life</h3>
<p>[Special Feature by Our Newspaper] Yu Qiaqing's coffin is being transported from the wartime capital to Shanghai and will enter the port tomorrow.</p>
<p>Almost everyone in Shanghai knows about this famous figure of the sea. In Yu Qiaqing's later years, people generally respectfully called him "Old Man Qiaqing," while some who liked to joke behind his back still called him "Brother A'de." However, the title of "Brother A'de" did not contain any disrespect. On the contrary, it seemed to have a more intimate meaning. In fact, Yu Qiaqing's career was indeed very admirable.</p>
<p>Yu Qiaqing was originally from Longshan Township, Zhenhai County, Zhejiang Province. Because Longshan is north of the three counties of Zhenhai, Cixi, and Yuyao, it is also known as Sanbei. Like many famous people, he also came from a poor background. At the age of fifteen, he went to Shanghai to work as an apprentice in a paint shop. This paint shop, since Mr. Yu entered the door, actually became more and more prosperous, earning a lot of profits. Later, others wore them and made up the story, and a myth was widely circulated.</p>
<p>Barefoot God of Wealth Starts as an Apprentice</p>
<p>It is said that the boss of the paint shop dreamed of a barefoot god of wealth sending in gold ingots the night before Yu Qiaqing entered the shop. The next day, when Mr. Yu entered the shop, it happened to be raining heavily. He was afraid that his shoes would get wet, so he took them off and held them in his hands, entering the door barefoot, but accidentally fell upside down. However, the shop owner not only did not blame him but thought it was a dream omen coming true, and the "living gold ingot" entered the door, so he gave him great preferential treatment, and Mr. Yu has been rising step by step and making a fortune ever since.</p>
<p>In fact, the factors of Mr. Yu's success were probably still in his diligence and eagerness to learn. At that time, he was an apprentice on the one hand and went to night school to study English on the other hand, so from the age of twenty-six, he left the paint shop and successively served as compradors in several foreign banks, gradually laying an economic foundation.</p>
<p>Although he was a comprador, he was not like the general comprador class, who only knew how to fawn on foreigners and exploit his compatriots. He was enthusiastic, insightful, and had nationalistic ideas. At that time, several sensational incidents occurred in Shanghai that caused disputes with foreigners, and Yu Qiaqing used great efforts to win back a lot of honor and rights for the Chinese people.</p>
<p>Strive to Win Rights and Interests from Foreigners</p>
<p>The first incident was in the 24th year of Guangxu, when the French sent troops to invade the cemetery of the Ningbo Guildhall, which aroused the anger of the people of Ningbo in the whole city and caused a strike that lasted for half a year. Later, thanks to the efforts of Yu Qiaqing and others, the French Concession Council gave up its original intention.</p>
<p>In the 31st year of Guangxu, 1904 in the Gregorian calendar, a so-called "big disturbance in the court" occurred in Shanghai. The cause was a dispute between Jin Gongbo, the presiding judge of the Mixed Court, and Mr. Twyman, the British vice-consul, over the detention of a female suspect in human trafficking. At that time, Jin Gongbo ruled that she should be temporarily detained in the women's prison, while Mr. Twyman insisted that she be imprisoned in the western prison. The western policeman on duty not only refused to obey Jin's ruling but also closed the gate of the court and held a club, intending to attack Jin. The people in the audience were very dissatisfied, and the news spread, and all walks of life felt injustice, which led to a strike. Some ignorant people were even so angry that they surrounded and burned the police station. Therefore, the concession authorities made a large number of arrests, and all the policemen in the world went on strike, and the chaotic situation was unprecedented. At that time, the Qing officials had no results in negotiations, so they only asked four gentry and merchants to come out to mediate, and Yu Qiaqing was one of them. However, the other three soon gave up halfway because of difficulties, and only Mr. Yu still persisted in arguing and negotiating with the Public Works Department in a non-arrogant and humble manner. Finally, the British side was forced to submit, fulfilling the conditions of removing Mr. Twyman from the post of juror, apologizing to the Chinese government, revoking the punishment of the policeman who insulted the Chinese official, and releasing the arrested civilians. Then Yu Qiaqing, together with the Daotai at that time and the presiding judge of the Mixed Court, went door to door along Nanjing Road to persuade the shops to open, and at the same time, Chinese and Western policemen resumed their posts, and a storm finally subsided.</p>
<p>In addition, he initiated the Chinese Merchants' Association to strive for Chinese municipal power and ran the Chinese Merchants' Gymnastics Association to strive for Chinese self-defense power. The former later obtained the quota of Chinese directors of the Public Works Department, while the latter established the Chinese team of the later International Volunteer Corps.</p>
<p>Indispensable Contribution to the Success of the Northern Expedition</p>
<p>Yu Qiaqing also made an indispensable contribution to the success of the Northern Expedition. At that time, when the revolutionary army advanced into Jiangsu and Zhejiang, Mr. Yu provided huge sums of money to support them and organized a goods exchange with the party members, making a great contribution economically.</p>
<p>His personal career was also thriving. The Siming Bank and the Ningbo and Shaoxing Steam Navigation Company, although under the pressure of foreign forces, finally relied on his perseverance and painstaking management, and their scale gradually took shape. Later, he established the Sanbei Company with his own funds and actively developed the shipping industry. He himself served as the president and chairman of the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, the Bankers' Association, and the Local Association, and was the de facto authority in Shanghai's financial and shipping circles.</p>
<p>In the mid-term of the War of Resistance Against Japan, Yu Qiaqing left Shanghai for the mainland. At that time, there were many unfavorable rumors about him in the society. No one dared to say for sure what the truth of this matter was. However, no matter what, Mr. Yu, as an old man in his seventies, was able to continue to engage in commercial activities in the mountainous mainland and contribute to the government's circulation of materials. This kind of spirit is still moving, so when his remains were transported back to Shanghai, we still felt infinite mourning.</p>

<h3>Wang Zhuchen Embezzles Enemy Property: District Attorney's Office Files Public Prosecution; Defendant's Statements Untrue and Unreliable</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The case of Wang Guichen's suspected embezzlement of enemy assets, namely the German company Wuyang Firm's automobile materials, has been under investigation by the District Attorney's Office since it was transferred by the Investigation Team for over two months. The investigation has now concluded, and a public prosecution has been filed. The original indictment is as follows: Wang Zhuchen, male, 28 years old, from Yangzhou, residing at No. 122 Shuntian Village, Chengdu Road, currently in custody. The defendant was originally a mechanical engineer in our country's air force, holding the rank of colonel and serving as factory director in air transport. In the winter of the year before the victory, he came to Shanghai under the pretense of attending his father's funeral and has resided here ever since. Initially, he made a living repairing and selling old bicycles at home. Later, he partnered with Qian Ziqiu, Zhu Qingyun, and others to establish the Fuzhong Company on Chuangong Road, specializing in automobile business (after the victory). They set up an office on Broadway Road No. 25. Later, the business was taken over by the defendant alone. After that, Yan Huiyuan, a classmate of the defendant from Germany, returned to China, and he and Yan and her husband, Yu Wei, jointly established the Xinyou Company. Through Yu's introduction, he met Li Jilan, the former Songhu</p>
<p>Garrison Commander. The Xinyou Company then moved to No. 2 Beihaining Road, the former Nagashima Firm, and voluntarily became a contracted automobile repair shop for the Songhu Garrison Headquarters. They repaired vehicles for the headquarters without charging labor fees, while materials were either provided by the headquarters or purchased on their behalf (see item 3 of the contract). The repair of vehicles was based on notifications from the Transportation Department of the headquarters (see item 5 of the contract). The No. 2 Beihaining Road factory originally contained materials left by Nagashima (detailed in the Nagashima Received Materials Inventory). Starting from August 1st of last year, it was reported that the materials were</p>
<p>moved without authorization. A portion was consigned for sale to the Russian Roseublum Automobile Company, and a portion was stored at the Central Machine Factory on Wuding Road. Wu Tianxiang secretly reported this to the Investigation Team for Handling Enemy and Puppet Assets, and the case was transferred for investigation. During questioning, the defendant admitted to moving the materials but claimed that the reported quantity was incorrect. He also claimed that the old cars and spare parts left over after repairs were the price paid by the garrison headquarters for</p>
<p>free repairs. Therefore, the materials he moved were his to dispose of freely. He also stated that their only evidence was the contract with the garrison headquarters. Therefore, whether the defendant is suspected of embezzlement depends on whether the ownership of the materials belonged to the defendant. Evidence No. 12, submitted by the defendant, is the seven-point contract, not a contract signed by both parties. There is no approval document for the submitted application for implementing the contract that can be used as reference. Evidence Nos. 4 to 8, except for No. 6, which mentions "inspecting old</p>
<p>automobile parts and estimating repair work," none of them indicate that the remaining materials after repairing the old cars of the garrison headquarters were allocated to the defendant. The defendant's side has no clear records or calculations of how much material was used to repair the 20 vehicles of the headquarters, how much material was received when moving into the Haining Road</p>
<p>house, and how many old cars were allocated by the headquarters. After sending a letter to the garrison headquarters to check the records, it was found that apart from using the Haining Road house as a contracted military automobile factory, the rest</p>
<p>had no record. The witness Yu Enbiao, presented by the defendant, testified in court that he was only a classmate of the defendant and knew nothing about the Nagashima matter, so he could not provide any support. Li Jinbiao, the director of the transportation department of the garrison headquarters, provided a written testimony, stating that the garrison headquarters had sent a Ford sedan (No. 15042), a small Ford sedan, and a Chrysler sedan to the factory for repair. The Chrysler sedan was approved for return to the owner, Su Chailin, and the repair fee of</p>
<p>over two million yuan had been paid in full. It is unlikely that such a small number of vehicles would warrant a large amount (five truckloads) of material as payment. Therefore, the defendant's statement is untrue and unreliable. He is suspected of the crime of embezzlement under Article 315, paragraph 2 of the Criminal Law. (As for Liu Zhongli's accusation against Ying Han, Yu Qingjian, and others regarding Wang Zhuchen's embezzlement of enemy assets, it is already on file as Case No. 4201, Series A, Investigation, Year 35, and should not be discussed in this case.) Therefore, in accordance with Article 230 of the Criminal Procedure Law, a public prosecution is filed. Prosecutor Yu Xin.</p>
<h3>Wu Yiming and Zhang Yichang Each Sentenced to Imprisonment</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The High Court yesterday announced the verdicts in two cases of suspected collaborators: (1) Wu Yiming, secretary of the puppet Suzhou Maintenance Committee, sentenced to five years of imprisonment. (2) Zhang Yichang, intelligence agent for the enemy naval intelligence agency in Manila, sentenced to three years of imprisonment.</p>
<h3>Yan Qingxiang Appears in Court Ailing, Sighs and Wipes Away Tears</h3>
<p>The case of Yan Qingxiang, general manager of the Suzhou Su Yarn Factory, being suspected of being a traitor, was previously investigated by the High Court multiple times. It was originally scheduled to be concluded by a collegiate panel yesterday morning, but because he was coughing up blood in prison and could not speak much, it was temporarily changed to an investigation hearing, and only Tang Shoumin, chairman of the puppet Commercial Control Association, and Ge Liangchou, chairman of the puppet Nanjing Municipal Chamber of Commerce, were brought to court to inquire about the puppet Cotton Control Committee. Yan was</p>
<p>carried from prison to the courtroom on a wooden-framed canvas reclining chair, wearing a blue cloth robe covered with a blanket, a black velvet hat, and a gray</p>
<p>scarf around his neck. His eyes were dull, his face</p>
<p>yellow, and he sighed softly from time to time, wiping away tears with a towel. A forensic doctor accompanied</p>
<p>him to court and reported his condition to the presiding judge, stating: Yan Qingxiang suffers from lung disease, with blood in his sputum. He coughed up blood in prison on October 31st, and the bleeding stopped on November 10th. But afterwards, the coughing up of blood has intensified and has not stopped until now, and the temperature is quite high. It is feared that speaking too much will cause him to cough up blood again, so please postpone the questioning. The forensic doctor also brought a</p>
<p>jar containing sputum and blood. After a short wait, Yan was carried back to prison.</p>
<h3>Not a Single Female Star Summoned: Disappointed Spectators; Xu Xinfu, Liu Zhonghao, and Shi Tingpan Released on Bail Separately; Li Lihua and Others Not in Shanghai, Submit Applications for Postponement</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Of the second batch of suspected collaborators in the film and theater industry summoned by the Investigation Division of the Municipal High Court, only director Xu Xinfu, Jin Du Theater Manager Liu Zhonghao, and Hu Guang Theater Manager Shi Tingpan reported yesterday. Many people went to the court hoping to catch a glimpse of the stars, but because not a single female star appeared, their efforts were in vain. Shi reported first at 9:10 a.m., and soon after, Xu and Liu arrived together. They sat inside the bailiff's room chatting. Zheng Ping, Mei Xi's wife, brought the subpoena to the court on behalf of Mei, who is not in Shanghai. The bailiff told her that criminal cases cannot be represented and that she should submit a written application. Zheng hurried out and completed a written application, but because the application form and procedures were not in compliance, it was</p>
<p>returned, and she was instructed to submit it in the afternoon. Zhang Puhai also submitted a written statement due to illness, stating that he could not appear. Li Lihua, Bian Yuying, and others claimed that they were not in Shanghai and also submitted written applications for postponement. At 10:30 a.m., the prosecutor began the hearing in the courtroom on the sixth floor, first summoning Shi Tingpan for questioning. At 11:10 a.m., Liu Zhonghao was summoned, followed by Xu Xinfu. The questioning ended at 12:30 p.m., and they were released on bail separately, with instructions to appear when summoned.</p>

The vacancy of the head of the General Affairs Department has been filled by Xu Shichang, a specialist commissioner.</p>
<h3>Military Discipline Rectification Conference Concludes Successfully</h3>

<h3>Underground Banks: Two Already Sealed; Several Provincial Banks Establish Offices; Procedures Not in Compliance</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The crackdown on usury in the city is currently underway. The Social Affairs Bureau has now discovered that several out-of-town money houses have set up communication offices in the city without authorization and are lending money at high interest rates. The bureau has taken action based on the severity of the circumstances, and two of them have already been sealed. According to sources who spoke to reporters, those engaged in usury have a variety of tricks. Some operate under the guise of shops, while others have no name and operate with just a telephone in a room. As for interest rates, they are currently around two cents per dollar. Due to the current economic downturn, the number of bad debts is increasing, and the black market often adopts the method of lending against collateral. This time, the Ministry of Finance and the Social Affairs Bureau are determined to crack down on usury. The methods used are to strictly examine the accounts of the money lending industry and analyze them in detail to detect the activities of illegal lenders, and to encourage whistleblowing, because the existence of "underground money houses" is seriously detrimental to legitimate money lending businesses. It is hoped that legitimate businessmen will not hesitate to report them. The interbank lending rate among money houses is as high as 16.5%, which also contributes to the rise of black market usury. In addition, the Social Affairs Bureau recently discovered that several provincial banks have established offices in the city to handle lending business, but the procedures are not in compliance. The offices are now separately requesting instructions from the provincial bank authorities.</p>
<h3>Ling Guangyan Retried for Opening Comfort Women Stations</h3>
<p>Ling Guangyan graduated from Chizhi University in his early years and studied in France. Later, he went to Japan to study commercial law and married a Japanese woman. After the outbreak of the Anti-Japanese War, he joined the puppet organization and served in various military and political positions, including a puppet major general brigade commander, for as long as six years. He also opened the "Dafa Company" in Suzhou and established "Comfort Stations," as evidenced by a commemorative photo of the opening banquet on April 27, 1938. This photo was voluntarily sent to the High Court by people from other provinces. The photo shows Ling with the Pen Military Propaganda Team and dozens of enemy men and women, with the inscription "In the land of Suzhou's singing and dancing, a beautiful day dawns; cherry blossoms and plum blossoms bloom together, and the garden is a family." Later, Ling was sentenced to twelve years by the High Court, but the Supreme Court remanded the case for retrial. Yesterday afternoon, the witnesses were summoned for investigation, and the hearing was adjourned to another date.</p>
<h3>Three Giant Cranes to be Built on Qiuxin Wharf</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The UNRRA Machine Factory is building three giant cranes on Qiuxin Wharf. One of them is the largest in the city, 150 feet long and 80 feet high, installed on a pontoon, and can lift 150,000 to 200,000 pounds at a time. The other two can also lift 40,000 to 50,000 pounds. These cranes are extremely large and can move heavy machinery such as generators and locomotives from ships to the wharf, requiring only a few workers to operate the machinery. In the future, the use of this machine to load and unload goods will be hundreds of times more efficient than in the past.</p>

<h3>Social Services: Reader Consultation</h3>
<p>Legal Queries</p>
<p>(1) Misunderstanding of Lease Agreement</p>
<p>Guo Hanqing asks: In January of the 26th year of the Republic (1937), I leased a piece of land from someone named Jia for a term of ten years. During the war, without considering the original agreement, I subleased the land to someone named Yi, with the term ending at the end of the 36th year of the Republic (1947), exceeding the original lease term by eleven months. Disputes may inevitably arise in the future. May I ask: (1) Am I liable for the crime of embezzlement under Article 335 of the Criminal Law and the crime of fraud and breach of trust under Article 339? (2) If the original landlord extorts me with this as an excuse, how should I respond?</p>
<p>[Lawyer Zou Liankui's Answer] The responsibilities that a person should bear are divided into civil and criminal. Those who bear civil responsibility under civil law do not necessarily have criminal responsibility. The act of subletting leased land to others without considering the original agreement, if indeed the case, does not constitute crimes such as embezzlement, fraud, or breach of trust. (2) The solution is to ask the landlord to extend the lease term or to ask the sublessee to shorten the lease term. The terms and conditions must be negotiated.</p>
<p>(2) Return of Shares</p>
<p>Wu Yuanfu asks: In May of the 33rd year of the Republic (1944), I invested 30,000 yuan (puppet currency) in a certain money house, amounting to 300 shares. The money house held a puppet license and was declared liquidated after the victory. Recently, I received a notice instructing me to go to a certain accounting firm to receive the return of my shares. The money house was valued at 10 million yuan, approved by the manager. There are legal issues in principle, and I pray for your answer: (1) When the money house was established, a shareholders' meeting was held to decide on all matters. Is it also necessary to hold a shareholders' meeting to approve matters during liquidation? (2) Is it legal for the money house to handle matters at a value of three? (3) The money house's manager asked to temporarily issue only small amounts, while keeping the integer number of shares under his name to maintain future development. (4) The money house's reputation is not an asset.</p>
<p>[Lawyer Qin Kui's Answer] (1) Commercial and financial institutions established with the approval of the enemy puppet regime are liquidated by order of the government and do not need to be dissolved by a resolution of the shareholders' meeting. (2) At the time of departure, if it is sold to others, and in fact can get more price, but intentionally give a lower price, it can be considered illegal. (3) How the corruption, need to be clear, if true, then it is illegal. (4) Commercial financial institutions established with the approval of the enemy, regardless of reputation, must be liquidated, if the enemy, then it is in the list of confiscation.</p>

<h3>Yarn Mills Get a Share: New Procedures for Yarn Allocation; Weaving Gets Priority, Followed by Replication Industry; Factories Share Profits with Customers and Export Sales</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The Textile Management Committee held a routine meeting at the Municipal Government Conference Room at 3:00 p.m. yesterday. Chairman Wu, Vice Chairman Li, Wu Weijing, Wang Qiyu, and Liu Citeng attended. After much discussion, it was resolved that cotton yarn produced by all state-owned and private yarn mills that also weave fabric should be given the highest priority for their own use. Next is the replication industry associations. The remaining quota will be split, half for the factories to transport to other provinces. The remaining half will be divided into two parts. One part will be allocated by the yarn mills to their old customers, and the other part will be allocated to the members of the Yarn Merchants Association. It is reported that the Textile Construction Company will decide today to allocate the remaining 2,000 bales of yarn at a price to yarn merchants, retailers, and some distributors.</p>
<p>The Sixth District Cotton Spinning Association also held a general meeting of members at 3:00 p.m. yesterday, which lasted until about 7:00 p.m. During the meeting, the members discussed the fourth round of yarn allocation in detail and resolved that after deducting 24,000 bales of cotton yarn used by the factories for their own weaving from the total amount of yarn allocated to state-owned and private factories in the fourth round, the remaining yarn that can be allocated is 51,250 bales. Of these, 24,000 bales will be allocated to the Replication Association, 2,000 bales will be used for the South Transport by Gu Factories, and 1,500 bales will be supplied to retailers. The remaining 23,750 bales will be divided equally into two parts, each with 11,875 bales. Half of the yarn will be freely transported and sold by the factories to other provinces, and the remaining half will be divided into two parts, each with 5,937.5 bales. Half of the yarn will be allocated by the private factories to their old customers, and the remaining half, according to the decision of the Textile Management Committee, should be allocated to the members of the Yarn Merchants Association. However, yarn factory colleagues believe that it should be freely disposed of by the factories, or transported to other provinces, or allocated to the Yarn Merchants Association, to show that yarn factories still have autonomy in their operations and to benefit production and sales. It has now been decided that the Textile Association will send a letter to the Textile Management Committee to request approval.</p>
<h3>Price Limits for Cotton Cloth Agreed Upon: Fine Cloth at 88,000, Fine Material at 85,000</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The Shanghai Municipal Cotton Cloth Price Review Committee held its fourth meeting at the Social Affairs Bureau Conference Room at 3:00 p.m. yesterday.

Director Gu reported on the minutes of the previous meeting, and then Dong Jiufeng reported on the recent market price of cotton (omitted). Then, the various costs compiled by the dyeing and weaving industry were discussed, amended and passed by the previous meeting, and verified by the Social Affairs Bureau, and it should be decided. After detailed discussion, it was unanimously decided that the cost price, 12 pounds of fine cloth is 88,000 yuan, 12 pounds of fine twill is 85,000 yuan, 191 mercerized cotton is 145,000 yuan, and serge is 105,000 yuan. Then, Dong Jiufeng stated that the cotton cloth market price should be calculated by adding a 12% profit to the factory price, which has been approved by the Textile Management Committee. It will be implemented as filed. Finally, Pan Shihao of the dyeing and weaving industry explained the recent yarn allocation situation, hoping that the quantity and quality of yarn allocation will increase to eliminate the black market. Finally, it was decided that the factory price will be submitted by the Social Affairs Bureau to the Municipal Government for approval and promulgation.</p>
<h3>Dull Bond Market</h3>
<p>The public bond market remained unchanged yesterday. With the exception of Category D bonds, the rest did not have new buying support and continued to be slightly sluggish. Category C bonds opened in the morning at 1370 yuan. A major player, Yuan Renchang, had orders. It gradually rose from 1350 yuan to above 1420 yuan. A certain household on the fifth floor had sales. Near noon, it was still below 1400 yuan. As a result, it only slightly decreased compared to the previous close. Categories A and B were flat, Category D rose, and Category E fell by 50 yuan. The transaction volume was 5 million yuan.</p>
<h3>Tight Coal Market</h3>
<p>The coal market for bituminous coal is experiencing a serious shortage due to the arrival of winter in the production areas and low production. Black market prices are soaring. This news has reached Shanghai. Although the Shanghai Fuel Management Committee is still trying to maintain stability, the supply is difficult due to the small amount of incoming goods. Factories and households are rushing to buy, causing the market to become even tighter, especially for bituminous coal. Prices are rising rapidly.</p>
<p>Coal Briquette Industry to Receive Raw Materials on the 25th</p>
<p>The Fuel Management Committee has decided to allocate raw material coal for the third phase of this month to the city's mechanized coal briquette industry starting from the 25th. The application for coal allocation for this month by various factories ended yesterday. The need for coal next month will be handled by representatives from various associations starting yesterday, and will not be resolved individually.</p>
<p>Regarding the shipment of Vietnamese coal to China, the Fuel Management Committee is currently continuing to negotiate with the Vietnamese authorities. It is said that the Vietnamese side needs to conduct the transaction in the form of material exchange, so the progress is somewhat slow, and it is feared that it will not be possible to come to China within the year.</p>
<h3>Continuous Arrivals: Rice Prices Continue to Weaken</h3>
<p>The rice market is experiencing a surge in arrivals, with a total of over 16,000 stones arriving in both the northern and southern markets. The market sentiment has become sluggish. Southern japonica rice continued to fall by over 2,000 yuan, and northern japonica rice also fell by a small amount of over 1,000 yuan. High-quality indica rice remains stable, but with a slight softening, while Du indica rice has also fallen by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. There are very few transactions. Baiyuan has dropped by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan, and Yinyuan has dropped by 2,000 yuan. Flour sales are lacking and the factory supply is limited. It is difficult for the market to improve. Miscellaneous brands of flour are gradually declining, falling by another small amount of 100 to 200 yuan. Wheat is flat. Red beans are not being consumed much, and have returned by a small amount of 1,000 yuan. The future form is still shifted by exports. Soybean transactions are few. Soybean cakes are flat and positive. Peanuts are offered up to over three thousand loads, going to the Nanyang banana trees as fertilizer. The oil market for raw oil is short of product and firm. The soybean oil market price is flat, but the sesame oil supply is greater than demand, with few major trades, dropping wildly by three to five thousand yuan.</p>
<h3>Yarn Market Stagnation: Confiscation of Discovered Black Market Transactions; Too Much Coarse Yarn in the Fourth Allocation</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] Yesterday, the yarn market remained extremely quiet. The number of attendees was small, and they were mostly chatting with each other, with no transactions to be discussed. It seemed they were waiting for the allocation from various factories. There was a notice from Mayor Wu in the market, stating that to encourage the reporting of black market transactions, once verified, the goods would be confiscated, and half of the proceeds would be awarded to the informant. As a result, off-market transactions have become even rarer, and various yarn shops are virtually out of business. The Cotton Yarn Reproduction Industry Yarn Allocation Committee's fourth cotton yarn allocation for the third period was finalized yesterday. The allocated yarn quantity will still be provided by the Textile Construction and the six district cotton textile associations, totaling 5,535 bales, similar to previous allocations. However, there is still an excess of coarse yarn and a shortage of fine yarn. Due to repeated excess allocations of 10-count coarse yarn, the Reproduction Committee has requested the Textile Management Committee and the six district textile associations to reduce the allocation and change to other counts. This time, yarn below 10-count is 926 bales, a significant increase compared to previous allocations. There is a shortage of 20-count and 42-count common yarns, and the Reproduction Committee expressed difficulties regarding this. The payment period is from the 25th, 26th, 27th to the 31st of this month. Some decisions in the past were cancelled due to late payments, and this is currently being expedited. For small factories that jointly apply for yarn and have the association make the payment, the procedures are more complicated, and the association is urging them to do so promptly.</p>
<h3>Joint Allocation Office Continues Allocation; Oil Prices Gradually Stabilizing</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] Cooking oil prices have been falling for several days, but rebounded yesterday. Cooking oil prices once rose close to the negotiated price limit. The Shanghai Cooking Oil Joint Allocation Office yesterday continued to receive 500 dan of allocated oil from various private factories, including 60 dan of Dayouyu soybean oil, 100 dan of vegetable oil, 100 dan of Dachangxin soybean oil, 80 dan of Dadexin vegetable oil, 65 dan of Changde soybean oil, 60 dan of Shunyu soybean oil, 20 dan of Dasheng vegetable oil, and 15 dan of Weimin soybean oil. This batch of cooking oil will be distributed to 142 retail stores in the central district. Also, yesterday, the Zhongpoquan Vegetable Oil Factory supplied 2,000 dan of vegetable oil, and the China Food Oil Company supplied 3,000 dan of vegetable oil, which will be handed over to the Food Oil Joint Allocation Office for distribution to stabilize oil prices.</p>
<h3>160,000 to 170,000 Black Market Oil; Social Affairs Bureau Sends Personnel for Thorough Investigation</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] Xinda Oil Shop on Henan Middle Road sells black market cooking oil. The purchase price of crude oil is 143,000 yuan, and the selling price is 170,000 yuan. The purchase price of soybean oil is 110,000 yuan, and the selling price is 160,000 yuan. Upon receiving the report, the Municipal Government ordered the Social Affairs Bureau to investigate, and the bureau has sent Inspector Wu to investigate the accounts.</p>
<h3>Morality Oil Factory Statement</h3>
<p>Yesterday's newspaper reported "A Central News Agency report on 2,000 yuan black market oil, stating that the Social Affairs Bureau yesterday discovered a black market oil sales invoice from Deyou Oil Shop on Caishi Street in this city, with a price of 2,000 yuan per catty." According to a letter from lawyer Fei Xizhen, the shop has never sold black market oil, and the above news is not true. A correction is hereby made.</p>
<h3>Sudden Surge in Gold Market; Foreign Currencies Rebound Accordingly; Hong Kong Gold Prices Soar</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Central Bank's control was slightly relaxed, and buyers became excited and the price surge resumed. The morning opened at 2,500,500, and there was a scramble to buy, gradually rising. However, it was still relatively peaceful at first. At 10:00 AM, the Central Bank still allocated 200 bars at a price of 2,512,500. After that, the Central Bank made no further supply, and after 10:30 AM, people became very bullish, forming a scramble to buy. Near noon, the price rose to over 2,580,000 before the Central Bank supplied over 1,000 bars. At noon, it hovered around 2,565,000. In the afternoon, people were still bullish, and the next-day delivery rose to over 2,580,000 before being forced to retreat. As a result, the closing price rose by 67,000 compared to the previous day. Jewelry gold rose to 97,200, silver dollar and silver ingot fell back, and the black market interest rate remained between 12 and 15 cents. Stimulated by gold prices, foreign currencies rebounded sharply. The black market price of US dollars rose gradually from the buying price of 4,400 yuan, and by noon it had risen to over 4,700 yuan. In the afternoon, it rebounded slightly. As a result, the closing price rose by 200 yuan compared to the previous day. Hong Kong dollars rose from 910 yuan to 930 yuan, also rising by 20 yuan.

Transactions were mostly in Hong Kong exchange, and the rest were quiet. The US exchange rate remained sluggish. Hong Kong gold prices soared to 330 yuan (Hong Kong dollars) per tael at yesterday afternoon due to rumors that Mexico would raise gold prices.</p>
<h3>If Japanese Cocoons Don't Arrive, All Silk Factories Will Stop Production by the End of the Year; Japan Indeed Has Surplus Cocoons for Exchange</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] All parties are still working hard on the matter of Japanese cocoons being shipped to China. Currently, in addition to the delegation to Japan and the MacArthur Headquarters continuing to negotiate, the Silk Factory Industry Association has telegraphed Ambassador Gu Weijun, requesting him to negotiate with the US government nearby. When Chu Fucheng goes to Beijing to participate in the National Assembly, he will also discuss with relevant authorities to promote an early resolution. Related personnel said: There are 90 silk factories of various sizes in the Jiangsu and Zhejiang regions, employing more than 20,000 workers. The current shutdown of some factories is due to the oppression of high-interest loans, not due to raw material problems. However, if Japanese cocoons cannot be shipped to China, all factories will be forced to shut down by the end of December. The China Silk Company currently has only 9,000 dan of cocoons, and is planning to allocate 4,000 dan, which is still a drop in the bucket and will not help much, because 11,000 spinning machines can use it all up in one day if they are all operating. Recalling that at the beginning of our country's negotiations with the Allied Headquarters, the Headquarters refused our country's request for two reasons: First, our country lacks "multi-spindle cars", so the quality of silk is inferior and does not meet the needs of the United States; second, the selling price of Chinese silk in the United States is too high, which is not as cheap as Japanese silk. Later, the Japanese government suddenly added a point, that Japanese cocoons must all be used for their own purposes, and there are no surplus cocoons that can be shipped to China. In fact, Japan lost many machines during the war, and there are indeed surplus cocoons available for our country to use. At present, what our country is asking for is barter, not compensation; in fact, during the 26th year of the Republic of China alone, the Japanese took 260,000 dan of cocoons from Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces alone, so it is reasonable to ask for compensation. Today, the raw material problem of silk factories can only be solved by shipping Japanese cocoons, because other silk-producing countries in the world currently have no surplus cocoons to sell.</p>
<h3>Import and Export Industry Gathering to Discuss Quota Allocation Issues</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] The Import and Export Industry Association of this city convened a board meeting the day before yesterday and decided to first study the various regulations of the import license system in detail, and then each director will submit detailed opinions separately, and then convene a meeting again this Saturday to discuss. In the new import and export method, there are two points that need to be explained by the Management Committee: One is how the quota will be allocated. There are no clear regulations in the article. The association hopes to participate in some opinions, so that the competent authority can better understand the actual situation and make the allocation more reasonable and fair. It is decided that for the regulations on reviewing imports, such as whether the Central Bank will supply foreign exchange when reviewing and approving, there are also no regulations in the original article. Relevant personnel speculate that it will not be easy to engage in the import and export industry in the future, because those engaged in this industry must have certain qualifications and must be professional; import is more difficult due to various controls, and future development will inevitably focus on export. However, the export industry is also full of difficulties, such as high product costs and lack of transportation tools. Regarding the goods ordered in the United States before the 17th, the Management Committee has stipulated that only those who are on board and waiting for transportation can apply for permission, but according to reliable sources, the standard may be relaxed, that is, all goods approved for purchase by the Central Bank can generally be imported.</p>
<h3>Tea Market Weakens</h3>
<p>After some tea merchants who were financially constrained unloaded their goods, the situation of the foreign firm tea market began to soften frequently. In terms of selling price, it remained stable at first, but then Chen Zhong Qimen fell to 135,000 yuan per dan, and the footings of other teas were extremely weak and unstable. Transactions were not smooth, and domestic sales of red and green teas were all lacking follow-up, and the process remained unchanged.</p>
<h3>Transshipment of Woolen Fabrics Continues to Arrive; The Future of Domestic Products is Dangerous</h3>
<p>The trend of woolen fabrics has been consistently flat recently. If high-interest loans are not eliminated, all industries will be unable to maintain. Although large and small businesses now seem to make a slight profit, they are secretly losing money due to the consumption of demolition interest. British woolen fabrics are transshipped from Hong Kong, and Japanese woolen fabrics are shipped from various ports by American ships. Recently, they have arrived in Shanghai one after another. Because the prices are cheaper than domestic products, sales are quite strong. Domestic woolen fabrics were previously oppressed by American goods, and now they are hit by transshipped goods. In addition, the levying of goods tax raises costs. If this continues, both factories and merchants may face the danger of destruction.</p>
<h3>American Cotton Continues to Fall</h3>
<p>[United Press News Agency, New York, 20th] Today, cotton prices fell slightly, and trading was flat. At closing, cotton futures fell by 1.35 to 2.25 cents per pound compared to the previous day. Also, New Orleans, 20th, cotton futures fell by 2.2 to 3.1 cents today.</p>
<h3>American Wheat Sets New High; Local Supply Situation Eases</h3>
<p>According to a major figure in the flour industry: The raw materials for flour are currently transported from the Longhai Railway and northern Jiangsu from time to time. At the same time, the production and sales volume of flour has also decreased relatively in recent months, so the raw material problem has eased. The flour used in North China, in addition to being supplied by local production, is also transported to Jinan from Shanghai and Xixi by the Ministry of Food. As for ordering foreign wheat, manufacturers themselves do not have this power, and the export restrictions on wheat from the United States and Canada are extremely strict, and the consent of their governments must be obtained in advance, so manufacturers do not pay much attention to the arrival of foreign wheat in China.</p>
<p>[United Press News Agency, Chicago, 20th] Today, wheat prices hit a 26-year high, with spot wheat trading at $2.25 per bushel. This is the highest price since 1920.</p>
<h3>Business Recession; Four Companies Liquidated Yesterday</h3>
<p>The business recession is deepening, and business bankruptcies and closures are common. Yesterday, the Yinda Dyeing and Weaving Factory, Xinda Jujube Factory, Yiyi Medicine Store, and China Merchant Shipping Company in this city announced the cessation of business and liquidation. It is reported that a large number of merchants may go bankrupt soon.</p>
<h3>American Silk Prices Look Low</h3>
<p>[United Press News Agency, New York, 20th] Since the government auctioned Japanese silk in October, lowering the price by 75 cents per pound compared to before, American silk prices are expected to continue to fall. The auction price of raw silk in October is close to the minimum official price.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Stock Market Fluctuates; Transaction Volume Sets New Record; Short Sellers Become More Active in the Afternoon</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the second phase of the China stock market opened for selection and trading. People still felt uneasy, and the market fluctuated and struggled a lot. In the morning, all stocks saw a high, and overnight short positions were hedged taking advantage of the high, and long positions were also closed. Soon, the price began to fall. At this time, because the difference between the current and deferred prices was very small, arbitrageurs could not operate, and there were occasional reverse arbitrage trades. Nos. 76, 229, 199, and 176 were sold off one after another, gradually declining. After 10:15, Nos. 151, 226, and 83 received them and rose again. However, No. 38 and No. 198 were sold, and they still struggled. At around 11:00, gold and banknotes soared, and the buying frenzy began. No. 226 traded Yong Yarn for immediate delivery, No. 233 and No. 76 traded Yong Yarn for spot delivery, and No. 33 traded Xinyi, so all stocks rose sharply to high prices. After this, the spot and deferred prices were pulled apart, causing arbitrage activity. Under the arbitrage sales of Nos. 186 and 207, they soon leveled off again. Near noon, Nos. 76 and 229 and others were supplied, and the long positions on the table scrambled to cut losses, and the situation became weak again, ending at a low price. Compared to the previous close, Xinguang rose slightly, and Yong Yarn, Maya, Xinyi, Jingfu, Xinguang, and Qinxing each fell slightly to half a percent. Yonggong was still flat. Huafeng rose slightly due to the deferred delivery, and the trading was lively. Among the cold stocks, Xin Ya Li'an rose slightly, and the rest fell slightly. In the afternoon, the market was almost entirely shorted by the exchange, and the market price was suppressed again with sparse transactions. Xian Yong Yarn retreated to a new low price of 552 yuan before struggling. As a result, compared to the previous close, Yong Yarn and Maya fell by 3%, Jingfu fell by a little more than half a percent, Qinxing fell by a little less than 1%, Xinguang was flat, and Huafeng rose slightly. Yonggong was also flat, the cold stocks Xin Ya Li'an and Rong Sao were still flat, underwear fell sharply by 10%, and the rest fell slightly. The total transaction volume for the day was 31.23 million shares, setting a new record. The prices of various stocks outside the market were stable and unchanged.</p>
<p>The foreign stocks formed a consolidation yesterday. They showed a slight improvement at the opening, and Yisha once rose to over 7,000 yuan, but it was difficult to last. As a result, compared to the previous close, Navigation, Yipi, and Wheelock were still flat, and the rest rose slightly.</p>

<h3>Ministry of Education Repeatedly Requests Additional Education Rehabilitation Funds; Executive Yuan Has Approved 40 Billion Successively</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 21st] The Ministry of Education previously stated that due to the national education rehabilitation, transportation delays, and soaring prices, the original budget for rehabilitation funds was insufficient. It requested the Executive Yuan to add 120 billion yuan for rehabilitation funds. The Executive Yuan did not approve the original request due to the huge amount of funding. However, the national education rehabilitation, the national institutions and schools, either in transit or waiting for construction funds, the situation is urgent and cannot be delayed. The authorities of various institutions and schools have repeatedly requested the Ministry of Education for relief. The Ministry of Education repeatedly appealed to the Executive Yuan based on the situation. In the middle of last month and the beginning of this month, the Executive Yuan allocated 10 billion yuan each time. The Ministry of Education had already prepared for the emergency needs of various schools, and the funds issued by the Executive Yuan twice were used to repay the advances and distribute the remaining funds to various schools. This was just a drop in the bucket. Now, although most of the national colleges and universities above the junior college level have been rehabilitated, the travel expenses used by land, sea, and air have exceeded too much, and the funds received or borrowed from the Ministry of Education are still insufficient to return. The funds that were borrowed for urgent travel and the construction funds of various schools, due to the rise in prices of materials and labor, either cannot be completed or urgently need to be repaired, and all have requested the Ministry of Education to approve the additional budget as requested by various schools and issue the funds as soon as possible. The Ministry of Education has repeatedly petitioned the Executive Yuan to approve the previous request for an additional 120 billion yuan. It is reported that the Executive Yuan now agrees to allocate another 20 billion for education rehabilitation relief. The Ministry of Education will wait for the official document before handling the fund receipt procedures, and then approve the funds according to the actual needs of education rehabilitation at all levels, and issue additional rehabilitation funds to national schools. It is said that the Executive Yuan will no longer issue additional funds after this. If this is true, the total of 40 billion before and after, combined with the original 120 billion requested by the Ministry of Education, is only one-third of the total amount.</p>

<h3>Victorious Return of the Expeditionary Wheel to Luoyang</h3>
<p>Today Leaving Shanghai for Beijing, Passing Through Xu and Bian Back to the Route</p>
<p>The Expeditionary Wheel basketball team, organized by officers and soldiers of the 6th Regiment of the Luoyang Ordnance Corps, arrived in Shanghai from their garrison area in Hubei a month ago.

From there, they would take the Yuehan Railway to Hubei, and then return to their Luoyang garrison to report for duty. Yesterday afternoon, Wu Zhuoming, the leader of the Expeditionary Wheel, suddenly received a telegram from the regiment commander ordering them to return immediately because there were other official duties to be handled in the area. Therefore, Wu decided to take all the players on the 9:00 AM express train today and go straight to Nanjing, then transfer to Xuzhou.

He is very grateful and will do his best to promote the vigorous atmosphere of the sports world in Shanghai to all parts of the mainland after returning to the garrison area. He plans to come to Shanghai again next year to learn from them.</p>

To avoid fierce competition, it was unanimously decided that the chairmanship would be given to France. China and the Philippines were elected as two of the seven vice-chairmen.</p>

<h3>One Year Since the National Army Entered the Northeast</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent Han Qingtao of This Newspaper in the Northeast</p>
<p>(Shenyang Air Mail on the 16th) "The soldiers all yearn for genuine peace. If that is achieved, I am willing to take off my military uniform and put on a civilian robe!"</p>
<p>·Words of General Du Yuming·</p>
<p>General Du Yuming was appointed to command the National Army out of Shanhaiguan to take over sovereignty in the Northeast and maintain public security in the region. His Chief of Staff, Zhao Jiaxiang, assisted him in strategizing. November 16th marks exactly one year. In this year, from Shanhaiguan in the south to the Songhua River in the north, from the Shulu River in the west to the Yalu River in the east, everyone in the Northeast has an image of Commander Du in their minds. "The 52nd Army, the 13th Army, the New Sixth Army, the New First Army, the 71st Army, the 93rd Army, the 60th Army... Since last year, they have entered the Northeast one after another. Now, although some of these troops have been transferred to other places, they have all left a deep impression on the people of the Northeast.</p>
<p>Whenever the National Army recovered a city, General Du would personally go to inspect it. He visited various cities between Shanhaiguan and Shenyang, as well as Fushun, Sipingjie, Changchun, Chengde, Zhangjiakou, Chifeng..., He went once more when Andong was recovered. He walked into Andong under the large red banner hanging with the words: "Welcome General Du, whose fame fills the Southwest and whose prestige shakes the Northeast." The people of Andong lined the streets to welcome him, and the Koreans also waved their trigram flags.</p>
<p>General Du walked into Andong, saddened by the destruction of factories and concerned about the suffering of the people. Therefore, as soon as he took off his dusty uniform, he drove his own military jeep to visit businesses and residents, to comfort them. The people all expressed their past suffering with grateful faces and tones.</p>
<p>The people of Andong constantly recounted the two terms "liquidation" and "struggle" to the people who came here from afar, as if telling their grievances, telling everyone what it was all about. A family called "Dachang Dyeing Factory" was able to liquidate the false Manchurian currency of 30 million, and it is unknown how many others were liquidated for millions and hundreds of thousands. Some local people compared "struggle" to a tragic farce.</p>
<p>Unbearable to Witness the Destruction</p>
<p>At the foot of the Zhenjiang Mountain in Andong City, there are rows of Western-style small buildings with green roofs and yellow bricks, and some are villas with bright red tiles or tiled. From a distance, they are indeed quite beautiful. Walking closer, they also look quite elegant, but the doors and windows are gone. Walking inside, the scene in front of you is that the porcelain washbasins are smashed, the porcelain toilets have fallen, the floors have been lifted, and the lights have been moved. The walls are covered with slogans written in red and blue ink, such as "Brothers of the Central Army, don't fight for the xxx, your wives and children are waiting for you!" In addition, it is really a mixed bag of insults, advice, mockery, and some ditties. Scattered on the ground are leaflets and drawings printed by the "Political Department of the Liaodong Military Region of the Northeast Democratic United Army."</p>
<p>We entered and exited many exquisite small houses. Upstairs and downstairs, the scenes were the same. Destruction was accompanied by desolation. Everyone left as if they were mourning a battlefield. The green pines and blood-red leaves in several courtyards were supporting the scenery after the turmoil and destruction.</p>
<p>The station was empty and desolate. Half of the platform at the bridgehead was suspended in the air, and the whole thing was overturned. One or two old locomotives were burning firewood, roaring hoarsely. It is said that the good locomotives were dragged across the river by the communist army and exchanged for some ammunition. Many ships were lined up on the Jiang'an of Xinyizhou, and many materials were piled up on the shore. The people pointed and said: "Those are our things!"</p>
<p>In the past, Andong had an arsenal, which had been destroyed beyond recognition. In the three major papermaking plants, the "Yalu River" and "Andong" papermaking plants had some of their machines moved away by the communist army, and then they set fire to them. This was a major blow to the Shenyang newspaper industry, because everyone hoped that the Andong papermaking plant would solve most of the difficulty of the Shenyang newspaper industry's lack of paper. Now, only the privately-owned "Liuhecheng" papermaking plant is left, and the existing machines can only manufacture some paper money for sacrifices.</p>
<p>Only empty houses remain of the four textile factories. Among the three rubber factories, only the "Dongya" factory was less damaged and has the hope of resuming work in the short term. As for the light metal industry, the automobile factory, cement, chemical, and steel-making factories, etc., the people said that they had been taken away by the Soviet army long ago. Among these factories, the automobile factory was the largest in scale. In the past, it could produce 120 cars every day, but now everything is over. After two great calamities, Andong's industry has become irreparable.</p>
<p>Double-Edged Sword Combat, Mobile Warfare, Rapid Marches of 120 Li per Day</p>
<p>The National Army that recovered Andong this time was the 52nd Army, which fought hard battles in the Northeast. The army leader, Zhao Gongwu, said in Cantonese: "Our politics must improve, because politics is not keeping up with the military now." He also said: "The district offices and county governments of the communist army are ahead of the army, but our political workers are lagging far behind. In the future, we should use more young people, so that they don't shrink back when things happen."</p>
<p>The Second Division of the 52nd Army has been reorganized into the New Second Army. The army commander, Liu Yuzhang, recounted the Battle of Motianling. He described how the communist army defended to the death and how the National Army climbed the cliffs bare-chested, resulting in great sacrifices on both sides. Xiong Qilao, the squad leader of the National Army, used his head and body to block the communist army's firing point, and his tragic sacrifice earned the National Army's final victory.</p>
<p>Army Commander Zhao and Army Commander Liu led the National Army to Andong, creating a new record for speed. It is said that the divisions of the 52nd Army were originally stationed in the Anshan area in the southern section of the Middle East Railway. On October 18th, at 3:00 PM, they received orders and concentrated overnight. On the 19th, they set off from Anshan. On the 20th, they began to encounter the communist army, fighting and advancing. On the 21st, after a day of fighting, they captured Motianling. On the 22nd, they continued to advance, with rapid marches of 120 li per day. At 4:30 PM on the 25th, they arrived in Andong. The journey of more than 600 li, calculated, except for more than two days of fighting, it only took more than four days to rush. Therefore, the people of Andong said it was a "divine army descending from heaven!"</p>
<p>General Du said: In the past year, the "double-edged sword tactic" has been used to divide Lin Biao's "pocket tactic," mobile warfare has been used to counter Mao Zedong's "one point two sides," and the communist army's tactic of disrupting the front line with plainclothes men first, then using the people to defend them, and then using the army to defend the rear, advancing in order, the National Army used the method of firmly plugging the last army, which has achieved the best results. The war in the Northeast in the past year should no longer be fought after the Chairman issued the ceasefire order. General Du said: "The soldiers all yearn for genuine peace. If that is achieved, I am willing to take off my military uniform and put on a civilian robe."</p>
<p>Building a New World in the Northeast</p>
<p>In order to build the Northeast and educate the children of the Northeast, General Du united with people from all walks of life to establish a "Zhongzheng University." In the Peace District, the original Japanese Girls' High School, the "Xingya Hall," the "Kanglong Pavilion," and other damaged houses have been rebuilt. From the mouth of Nan Yi Tiao Ma Road to the mouth of Nan Wu Tiao Ma Road, it occupies two streets horizontally and is extremely magnificent. The faculty lineup is also very impressive. The future development is limitless. The students in the Northeast, who have been in a chaotic situation for years, are now settled here, bathing in the spring breeze.</p>
<p>The Japanese Shrine in Shenyang used to be very famous in the Northeast. Every day, countless Japanese men and women came to pay their respects there, and the daily income from donations was also considerable. After the restoration on August 15th, it suddenly became deserted. Some troops were stationed in the empty and tidy place. This went on for a year.</p>
<p>In order to eliminate this symbol of Japan's victory in invading the Northeast, General Du rebuilt it into the "Memorial Shrine for Fallen Soldiers." The cement archway in front of the Japanese shrine that everyone was accustomed to seeing had its top removed and became a very good double-cross archway representing our National Day. The hall in the courtyard was repainted with red paint, and memorial tablets were placed inside, with the national emblem painted on the top. All traces of the enemy and the puppet regime were renovated as much as possible, so the whole view was changed. The ancient pines and temples are quiet and tidy, making it a good place for the heroic souls to rest in peace.</p>
<p>On November 16th, the anniversary of the National Army's entry into Shanhaiguan, a ceremony was held to inaugurate the Shrine for Fallen Soldiers. All circles in Shenyang expanded the army condolence on this day and presented flags to Director Xiong Bin of the Headquarters, Commander Du Yuming, General Peng Bisheng, and Director Yu Jizhong. In addition, more than ten religious and cultural groups specially erected a black velvet curtain inside the shrine, expressing their gratitude to the heroic spirits of the National Army and praying for peace in the Northeast as soon as possible.</p>
<p>The ceasefire order has been issued. The National Assembly has been convened. Peace is showing in the Central Plains and the Northeast. There can be no more civil strife, no more destruction. For the sake of national prosperity and survival, the people unanimously demand that everyone jointly extinguish the wildfires that have been unquenchable in Guandong for more than a year, so as to build a new world in the Northeast!</p>

<h3>New Appointed Siamese Ambassador to China is Nai Sashi · Durarat</h3>
<p>— This Newspaper's Travelogue Correspondent Huang Jiesun</p>
<p>Bangkok Air Mail, 6th</p>
<p>"Chinese and Siamese people are very similar and difficult to distinguish. Their blood relationship is particularly inseparable. If you casually ask any Siamese person on the street, they will tell you that their grandfather or great-grandfather was Chinese."</p>
<p>The Siamese Prime Minister once told me this. The Prime Minister who said these words was himself the son of a Chinese man. Generally speaking, those holding prominent positions in Siam are descendants of overseas Chinese. Nai Sashi. Durarat (Sanguan Tularak), who was recently appointed as the Ambassador to China, is also the son of a Chinese man. If based on Chinese nationality laws, they are all Chinese citizens.</p>
<p>Nai Sashi participated in the June 24th coup. After the success of this bloodless revolution, he served as a high-ranking official during the governments of Phraya Phahon and Luang Phibuns, but without a specific title. When the Pacific War broke out and Japanese troops occupied Siam, he escaped from the grip of the Japanese army and went to Chongqing, then to the United States and the United Kingdom, advocating for a "Free Thai" movement. He had extensive interactions with people from all walks of life in our country, and gradually became known to the world. After the war in Siam, he was an assistant in the Ministry of Education and chairman of the war crimes investigation group. Although his position was not high, he was a person under observation on the political stage of Siam.</p>
<p>Post-war Siam was restricted by others in politics, economics, and even military affairs. At the same time, French soldiers were invading its borders. It was truly a situation of looking around and finding no one to call for help. Many people with insight turned to China. Nai Sashi can be said to be one of the leaders. After the United States and the United Kingdom, followed by France, put forward new demands to Siam, they simultaneously sent ultimatums to Siam, demanding that Siam return the four provinces. This was a major lesson for the anti-Chinese elements in Siam, and the general public also understood China's goodwill. Even Nai Biri, who was known for his anti-Chinese and pro-British stance, first made a special trip to visit our country. If Nai Sashi can perform well, he will undoubtedly become a heavyweight in the future political arena of Siam.</p>
<p>In Siam, Nai Sashi associated mostly with our country's overseas Chinese businessmen and personnel stationed in Siam. I also met him often. He has a completely Chinese appearance and a completely Chinese spirit. When his appointment as the Ambassador to China was officially announced with our country's approval, I asked him what he thought of it. He frankly said:</p>
<p>"I am very happy. This gives me the best opportunity to engage in promoting a deeper understanding and connection between China and Siam."</p>
<p>His wife and one son and one daughter lived in Chongqing for more than a year. His daughter speaks fluent Mandarin, and she excitedly said to me in Mandarin:</p>
<p>"Dad is going to Nanjing, and my mother and I will go soon too. – I like China."</p>
<p>Nai Sashi is currently forty-four years old; his wife is forty-two years old. His daughter is twenty years old; his son is eighteen years old and went to the United States to study two months ago. His father, Zhang Liangsheng, just passed away a few years ago. In his home, there still hangs a large golden character "Shou" (longevity) and a congratulatory couplet presented by his relatives on his father's eighty-second birthday: "Peach blossoms have bloomed in three layers of waves, a sign of longevity and auspicious omens in the five-colored clouds."</p>
<p>Nai Sashi is scheduled to leave for Nanjing in the middle of this month. For him, we cannot simply regard him as an envoy of Siam, as we would for other countries. We should see him as a descendant of China who has been living abroad, newly returning from a foreign land!</p>
<p>At the same time, we must also know that Siam has deep expectations for China. We should give her support and care, so that she can grow and become strong. – This is a task for our China, and it is also a responsibility that our China should bear.</p>

<h3>The Three Barrenness of Hefei</h3>
<p>— Our Newspaper's Reporter in Anhui, Bai Ping</p>
<p>16th Dispatch</p>
<p>Autumn is deep, and the people living in Hefei have intimately felt the meaning of early winter. You see, the Hongshang Cuigai, Tender Lotus, and Fresh Lotus of the Baogong River are now just a pool of autumn water, and the scenery is desolate. As for Xiaoyaojin, except for withered grass and fallen leaves, accompanied by a pool of stagnant water, there is nothing else. On the streets, pedestrians are trying out their winter clothes, which already look hazy. By evening, just past nine o'clock, the shops close one after another, making it lonely to walk the streets. This deep autumn season, Hefei is much more desolate than summer!</p>
<p>The number of people returning from recovery is gradually increasing, and civil servants from various counties are constantly coming to the provincial capital for official business. Although it has become the political center of Anhui today, the ancient atmosphere is still undiminished from previous years. Whether living here or passing through here, as long as you have stayed in the Shanghai-Nanjing area, you will also experience the emptiness in life and see the three major barrenness of Hefei today: the housing barrenness, the entertainment barrenness, and the fuel barrenness.</p>
<p>Housing Barrenness: It's Difficult to Find Even After Wearing Out Your Shoes</p>
<p>Hefei spent eight years of suffering under the clutches of the Japanese invaders. Eight years, the time should be considered long enough. The enemy did not build here, but destroyed. Coupled with the illegal requisition of bricks, tiles, wood, and stone materials, as well as several bombings before the fall of the city, when the provincial government moved from Lihuang last year after the victory, only half of the buildings in Hefei's urban area remained. These remaining half of the buildings were mostly dilapidated, making it difficult to avoid wind and rain. After more than a year, although there has been some renovation and new construction, it is still far from meeting the demand, forming today's serious housing problem.</p>
<p>The first to feel the threat are the family members of civil servants who find it difficult to arrange housing. They repeatedly ask friends and plead for favors, but in the end, they only get a few dilapidated small houses. This was still the situation last year. In the past six months, if you want to rent a house, you will feel like you have "worn out your shoes and still can't find a place." The reporter has walked through many streets and alleys here, and sees that every household is packed to the brim. Even the dormitories originally rented by the government for unmarried civil servants have beds next to each other, no different from the steerage section of a ship. Furthermore, some important personnel here have had to come without their families because it is too difficult to find housing. Mr. Liu Zhenru, the chairman of the Provincial Party Headquarters, and Mr. Pu Mengjiu, the Director of the Finance Department, have become unmarried civil servants here, living with their colleagues. There is a joke here about housing: when Mr. Pu Mengjiu came to Anhui to take over as the Director of the Finance Department, he took over the house rented by the previous Director Gui. Who knew that the landlord wanted to increase the rent and blocked the door, not allowing Mr. Pu to move his luggage in. Mr. Pu was unable to enter and had no choice but to agree to the landlord's high price request before he could unload his luggage. Yes, in Hefei today, where housing is severely barren, it is fortunate to have a house to live in, so why bother to avoid the landlord's exploitation?</p>
<p>The reporter arrived here that day, because the ship arrived late, and could not find a hotel after entering the city. With great difficulty, I stayed overnight at a small inn where "the rooster crows early to see the sky." The next day, I moved to the Victory Hotel. The Victory Hotel is a guesthouse set up by the provincial government. There is no such hotel in Hefei. The rooms and hospitality are very good, and it is stipulated that there is no charge. However, the reporter moved in only as a temporary measure, so I have now moved to the Social Apartment. This is run by the Social Service Department. Although the rooms are small, the fees are slightly lower than those of general inns and hotels. Here, I should thank them for providing convenience to the reporter.</p>
<p>The housing barrenness in Hefei does not seem to have a proper solution at present. First of all, the provincial government's establishment is not permanently in Hefei. Although the offices of various departments are cramped, they have to make do for the time being. The civil servants themselves also feel that since the provincial government will move back to Anqing, why bother building their own houses? Just live as best they can. As for the people, everyone feels the pressure of life. If they have a house to squat in, they will just squeeze in. If it is really impossible, they will build more thatched houses to live in temporarily, and then make plans after catching their breath. In this way, the government has no intention of building, and private individuals have no power to build. The housing barrenness is allowed to continue!</p>
<p>Entertainment Barrenness: A Lack of Joy is Also a Kind of Joy</p>
<p>Whether you live at home or work as a civil servant, the feeling of everyone is that life is too monotonous, and young friends feel even more isolated. If you want to find entertainment to adjust your life, it will be enough to make you rack your brains.</p>
<p>There is now one Peking opera theater and two cinemas in Hefei, but you can't find any entertainment. In terms of Peking opera, the artistic level of the performers is certainly low enough, and the plays performed are not satisfactory either. The plays that are often performed are things like "Baochan Sends Wine", "Spider Cave", and "Spinning Cotton", or sometimes they are new plays written and performed by themselves. Many scenes are very far-fetched and tasteless, only giving the young lads a little subconscious stimulation. As for the movies, colorful foreign films are certainly not appreciated here, and most of the domestic films are pre-war films or toxic works made by fallen stars during the Anti-Japanese War. Films such as "Meng Lijun", "Plum Blossom Falling", "Biro Princess," "Wild Rose," and "Xiao Xiang Night Rain" are all welcomed here. This is definitely not because the audience's standards are low, it's just that they can't find any entertainment and have to "take medicine locally"! As a result, Peking opera and film theaters are packed.</p>
<p>Other than that, there are no dance halls, no parks, and not even a small teahouse to sit in. No matter where you go, apart from meeting friends to chat, you can only feel stuffy in the house!</p>
<p>The reporter believes that it would be best for the provincial government to initiate the organization of a drama club to hold regular evening parties, and at the same time, properly guide the commercially run theaters, teach them how to improve. This will not only partially solve the entertainment barrenness of the people, but also help improve administrative efficiency.</p>
<p>Fuel Barrenness: Bald Mountains Without End.</p>
<p>Speaking of fuel, the problem is quite serious. There are currently 55,000 to 60,000 people in Hefei, and the daily consumption of fuel is considerable. Moreover, the main sources of fuel are wild grass, firewood, and charcoal. Although it is less than ninety kilometers from Hefei to the Huainan Coal Mine, the Huainan Mine Railway has not been restored below Shuijiahu, and the coal production is transported to Bengbu and then sold along the Lianpu and Longhai Railways. A small amount of bituminous coal produced by the Yufeng Coal Mine in Chaoxian County is also transported to Hefei, but only bathhouses and restaurants use it. Residents never buy it. Therefore, wild grass, firewood, and charcoal sell in large quantities.</p>
<p>Wild grass, firewood, and charcoal are mostly produced in the western countryside of Hefei, and are transported to the city entirely by human labor or wheelbarrows. Wild grass grows widely in the mountains and fields, so its value is relatively low, with a selling price of over 5,000 yuan per load. As for firewood and charcoal, their value is high. Firewood requires a minimum of 10,000 yuan per load, while charcoal is 32,000 yuan. Recently, seeing that the snowy winter is coming soon, firewood and grass will one day be available for money but not for sale, so residents are storing a little. As a result, things are scarce and expensive, and prices are gradually rising. Some people are even starting to do this kind of business. For example, in terms of firewood, some people go to the countryside to contact the villagers, agreeing on a price for a tree, which is not high in value originally. After he cuts it down and transports it to the city, it becomes ten times the price. In this way, there is a way to make money, so many people are doing this business. The trees in the countryside are decreasing day by day, and the prices in the city are increasing day by day. If this situation continues for a long time, it is a small matter for consumers to spend a few more dollars, but the trees in the countryside are not only not increasing but are being cut down every day, which is even more serious. In recent years, our country has made some efforts in afforestation, but there is afforestation here, but no forest protection. On the contrary, there is competition in felling forests. What do you say about this? At present, the cost of fuel in Hefei is higher than using coal, and the four townships are full of bare mountains. In the future, the price of firewood and charcoal will only increase day by day, and the forests in the countryside will decrease day by day. The fuel barrenness will also become more and more serious.</p>

<h3>New Talks on Medical Circles</h3>
<p>— Shao</p>
<p>One Thousand Cases of Clinical Trials of Streptomycin</p>
<p>Streptomycin, also known as Streptomycin, is the most promising antibiotic after Penicillin. Starting in March of this year, the United States government united relevant parties to conduct large-scale clinical trials in an organized and planned manner to determine its therapeutic value. The Chemotherapy Drug Committee of the National Research Institute is also one of the participating organizations. Recently, Keefer et al. published the results of a clinical trial of one thousand cases in the September issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association. The full text is over 20,000 words and is one of the most important documents on this element. The main points have been selected and included in the book "Penicillin, Streptomycin, and Other Antibiotics" (this book is the revised third edition of "The Therapeutics of Penicillin").</p>
<p>Therapeutic Value of Streptomycin</p>
<p>As far as is currently known, streptomycin is the most effective therapeutic agent for tularemia, Haemophilus influenzae infections, urinary tract infections caused by Gram-negative bacilli, and bacteremia and meningitis caused by such bacteria.</p>
<p>The therapeutic results of streptomycin for brucellosis, rat-bite fever, and Salmonella infections (i.e., paratyphoid fever, etc.) are highly questionable and difficult to judge at present.</p>
<p>Regarding the efficacy of various types of tuberculosis, streptomycin does have considerable value, but it is only an auxiliary therapy to the current standard therapy and should not be relied upon as the only therapy. For disseminated tuberculosis such as miliary tuberculosis, tuberculous meningitis, and laryngeal tuberculosis, streptomycin has the effect of inhibiting the propagation of tubercle bacilli and preventing the progression of the disease. It also has the same therapeutic effect on exudative pulmonary tuberculosis.</p>
<p>Practical Application of Streptomycin</p>
<p>There are many practical difficulties in the clinical application of streptomycin.</p>
<p>First, the current production is limited. The products of various factories in the United States are all bought by government agencies, and it is extremely difficult to buy on the market. Even if you can buy it, its value is extremely high, about eight US dollars per gram. The daily dose is between two and five grams. For tuberculosis, treatment should last at least three to six months. For other infections, it should last at least one or two weeks.</p>
<p>Second, when using this element, if the dose is insufficient, the bacteria in the body are extremely prone to developing drug resistance, which will make the treatment ineffective. Therefore, if it is decided to use this element for treatment, a sufficient dose must be used from the beginning and must be continued to the end. Because the supply is currently difficult, the entire amount of medicine needed for several weeks or even months must be purchased before starting treatment so that the treatment will not be interrupted and drug-resistant bacteria will be produced.</p>
<p>Third, streptomycin has considerable toxicity. There have been reports of several deaths in the United States due to the use of this element. Therefore, it should be used with caution and should not be administered intravenously.</p>
<p>However, these difficulties are not insurmountable. It is estimated that most of them will be resolved by this time next year.</p>
<h3>Eye Hygiene</h3>
<p>— Miao Lian'en</p>
<p>The eyes are the head of the five senses and have a close relationship with health. It is needless to say that the pain of losing sight is unspeakable. Looking at the people of our country who are blinded by eye diseases, it is quite numerous. If everyone has appropriate hygiene knowledge of the eyes, it can not only prevent diseases but also increase happiness. The origins of eye diseases and their prevention methods are briefly described on the left:</p>
<p>(1) Congenital Eye Diseases: Some eye diseases are inherited from ancestors and occur continuously in a family, such as congenital cataracts and color blindness. The former can be removed by surgery, but the lack of vision makes it impossible to handle delicate work. The latter may not be able to work in the transportation industry because they cannot distinguish between red and green. Some are harmful to children due to the consanguinity of parents, such as retinitis pigmentosa. Patients may not feel any difference in childhood, but by the time they reach adolescence and middle age, they feel night blindness, vision gradually declines, and the field of vision (range of vision) gradually shrinks. Thus, the patient only sees what is directly in front of them and cannot see to the sides. Some are caused by parents' sexually transmitted diseases to their children, such as congenital syphilis, which also causes eye diseases, resulting in disability. There are also cases of parents' myopia being inherited by their daughters. Therefore, to prevent such diseases, pay close attention to the choice of a spouse. Mothers with syphilis should be treated early to eliminate syphilis, so that a healthy baby can be produced in the future.</p>
<p>(2) Acquired Eye Diseases. (A) Infectious Eye Diseases: Infectious eye diseases are all caused by bacteria or microorganisms, such as acute conjunctivitis, corneal ulcers, trachoma, and gonococcal ophthalmia. Mothers or nannies with conjunctivitis or trachoma are most likely to transmit it to infants due to close contact. Children's toys and hands must be kept clean at all times to prevent bacteria from entering the eyes. Adults easily carry bacteria into their eyes by touching banknotes, newspapers, doorknobs, faucets, tickets, and objects in all public places. Therefore, avoid rubbing your eyes with your hands on weekdays. If necessary, use a clean handkerchief instead. It is especially important to develop the habit of washing hands. The patient's washing utensils should be completely separated from those used by family members, and they should seek medical treatment patiently, as trachoma cannot be cured in a short period of time. Mothers with gonorrhea have gonorrhea that enters the baby's eyes when the baby passes through the birth canal. On the third day after birth, the eyelids swell and drain pus. If not treated immediately, the eyeballs will be perforated and blind. Modern obstetricians use eye inflammation prevention methods for newborns, so the disease rate is lower than before. Internal diseases that can cause eye diseases include meningitis, measles (commonly known as measles), typhoid fever, dysentery, malaria, nephritis, typhus, relapsing fever, diabetes, acquired syphilis, and tuberculosis. Blindness in children due to infectious diseases is common, and the biggest reason is malnutrition, especially the lack of vitamin A. (B) Non-Infectious Eye Diseases: Refractive errors (referring to myopia, hyperopia, presbyopia), strabismus, cataracts, and injuries all belong to this category. Those with refractive errors often feel inconvenient at work and should have their vision carefully examined and fitted with glasses by an expert to improve vision and eliminate self-exertion fatigue. If strabismus is found in children, the eyes should also be examined first, because most of the strabismus in children is caused by refractive errors. We should try our best to dispel the misconception that "wearing glasses will make your eyes worse." For prevention, babies' toys should have thick lines and not attract the baby's attention. The light in the bedroom should not directly illuminate the head, and the head should be against the window and the lamp. The fonts in children's books should be large, and they should sit upright and maintain a proper distance between their eyes and the book, about twelve to fourteen inches. Tilting the head to read and write must be corrected. If you cannot see the words on the blackboard in the classroom and feel eye swelling, head swelling, or pain after reading, it is a phenomenon of refractive error and you must ask an expert to examine it. Often, once you put on glasses, you will feel comfortable as usual. Cataracts should also be treated by experts, and most of them need to be surgically removed. With the gradual development of modern industry, eye injuries are often seen, which can affect vision, reduce work efficiency, or cause blindness, causing lifelong harm. Both labor and capital should be strictly protected. Electric welders wear anti-glare glasses, and blacksmiths wear anti-iron glasses, which can avoid many injuries. Minor injuries are often delayed for treatment, so injuries that could have been cured become incurable, especially when chemicals accidentally enter the eyes. Wash immediately with water, then go to the doctor for treatment, and the hope of recovery is high.</p>
<h3>Chronic Otitis Media</h3>
<p>— Wang Pengwan</p>
<p>Its Pathology and Treatment Principles</p>
<p>Before discussing this topic, we should first explain the definitions of "chronic" and "otitis media." Most otorhinolaryngology authorities believe that if acute suppurative otitis media does not cause any serious symptoms after six months but continues to have pus discharge, it can be called chronic otitis media. Six months is actually a very broad limit, as most cases develop into a chronic state before six months. As for the otitis media referred to in this article, it is suppurative otitis media with tympanic membrane perforation and frequent pus discharge. It should not be confused with the commonly known chronic catarrhal otitis media.</p>
<p>The principles of treatment for chronic otitis media are entirely based on its classification. The classification is briefly described below:</p>
<p>According to histology, the tympanic membrane can be divided into two parts: the pars tensa and the pars flaccida. According to expert statistics and our experience, chronic otitis media with perforation in the pars tensa, regardless of the amount of pus or the severity of the odor, never leads to serious complications. Serious complications refer to life-threatening diseases such as meningitis, inner ear suppuration, lateral sinus thrombosis, blood poisoning, and brain abscess. Conversely, tympanic membrane perforation in the pars flaccida often leads to the above-mentioned serious complications after several years or decades. As for mastoid perforation and postauricular abscess, they are considered less severe complications. In cases of chronic otitis media with pars flaccida perforation, at least 90% have cholesteatoma-like masses in the middle ear and mastoid. These cholesteatoma-like masses gradually grow, erode the surrounding bone tissue, and promote bacterial infection, which causes various serious complications.</p>
<p>Therefore, based on the location of the tympanic membrane perforation, chronic otitis media can be divided into two types. Perforation in the pars tensa never causes any serious complications and is called simple chronic otitis media. Perforation in the pars flaccida often leads to serious complications and is called cholesteatomatous chronic otitis media.</p>
<p>These two types of chronic otitis media can be diagnosed not only by the location of the perforation but also by using trial therapy and mastoid X-rays to distinguish them. If the pus discharged from the ear, no matter how strong the odor, does not have cholesteatoma-like masses, the odor can be completely eliminated after ten days of irrigation, ear drops, and nasopharyngeal disinfection. However, if cholesteatoma-like masses are present, the discharge, no matter how small, cannot have its odor reduced by any treatment. In addition, X-rays of the mastoid can also prove which type of chronic otitis media it is, as cholesteatomatous chronic otitis media often has special shadows in the mastoid.</p>
<p>Simple chronic otitis media is a harmless disease, while cholesteatomatous chronic otitis media is an extremely dangerous disease. Therefore, we can stipulate that the treatment principle for simple chronic otitis media should aim at keeping the middle ear clean, while the treatment principle for cholesteatomatous chronic otitis media should aim at reducing the possibility of life-threatening complications.</p>
<p>To keep the ear clean in simple chronic otitis media, attention should be paid to the external auditory canal and the Eustachian tube. Maintaining the cleanliness of the external auditory canal is relatively simple. Irrigation followed by ear drops (such as boric acid saturated in 70-degree alcohol) used several times a day can make it quite clean. When the pus decreases, the frequency of treatment should also be reduced until there is no pus, then the treatment can be stopped. During the treatment or during the period of stopping the treatment, the external auditory canal should be blocked with cotton to prevent dust or dirty water from entering. Maintaining the cleanliness of the Eustachian tube is more difficult because the Eustachian tube has close relationships with the nasopharynx, nasal cavity, and paranasal sinuses. If the patient is a child, attention should be paid to the condition of the tonsils and adenoid hypertrophy. If the patient is an adult, the paranasal sinuses should be strictly examined and treated appropriately to keep the Eustachian tube clean.</p>
<p>To eliminate the possibility of cholesteatomatous chronic otitis media causing life-threatening complications, surgery should be used to remove the cholesteatoma-like mass from the middle ear and mastoid. The standard operation is mastoidectomy.</p>
<p>In summary, the treatment of chronic otitis media should be prescribed according to its classification. Simple chronic otitis media does not endanger life, and the principle of treatment is to keep the middle ear clean, and the middle ear itself does not require surgery. However, cholesteatomatous chronic otitis media has the possibility of endangering life, and surgical treatment is its only treatment method.</p>
<h3>New Anti-malarial Drugs</h3>
<p>— Zhang Ming</p>
<p>Because the entire world's quinine production is almost entirely concentrated in the Dutch East Indies, both World Wars saw belligerent countries devote themselves to the research of antimalarial drugs due to the threat and resulting panic of cutting off quinine supplies.</p>
<p>During World War I, Germany worked hard to find quinine substitutes during the blockade. Although it did not benefit during the war, it finally invented two synthetic antimalarial drugs, Pamaquine and Atebrin, after the war.</p>
<p>During this war, Germany did not have any important achievements in this area, but scientists from the United Kingdom, the United States, and China have made considerable achievements after years of effort. The United Kingdom invented Paludrine, which is completely different chemically from known antimalarial drugs, thus opening up a new path for antimalarial drug research, so its potential importance may be greater than its actual importance. It has strong efficacy, few side effects, and the possibility of reducing recurrence rates. The United States has conducted extremely large-scale research on antimalarial drugs, studying no less than thousands of drugs. Among the published drugs, Chloroquine is the most outstanding. This drug has very strong efficacy, is quick and lasting, greatly reduces recurrence rates, and has fewer side effects than Atebrin. This drug was synthesized by the Germans early on, but they abandoned it because they thought the efficacy was not good; the Americans adopted better research methods and discovered its many advantages. Our country also conducted research on anti-therapeutic drugs during the War of Resistance, but due to the simplicity of the equipment and the harsh working environment, no important discoveries were made. The only thing worth mentioning is the scientific proof of the anti-malarial efficacy of Changshan. The continued research on this drug has now been moved from Chongqing to Shanghai. The several crystalline components obtained in Chongqing are now being refined again, hoping to clarify their chemical structure. As for the actual value of Changshan, it cannot be determined at present, because the currently obtained active ingredients are still quite toxic.</p>
<h3>Prevention of Beriberi - One of Discussions on Improving Health among Ordinary People</h3>
<p>— Ni Zhangqi</p>
<p>People who do not appear to be sick sometimes feel weak, easily fatigued, or have numbness in certain parts of their body, or leg pain, etc. It starts lightly and gradually worsens. These patients often continue to carry out their business. However, because of weakness and fatigue, business is repeatedly lost. Hundreds of thousands of farmers and workers suffer reduced products or poor quality due to weakness and fatigue. If it is piecework or self-cultivation, then the farmers and workers themselves suffer losses; if it is monthly salary, then the company suffers losses. Little by little, accumulated across the country, the annual loss is shocking, but for hundreds or thousands of years, such losses have continued, and only recently has anyone paid attention to it.</p>
<p>Without appropriate treatment or prevention, the disease continues to progress, the efficiency of work continues to decline, and the losses to individuals and society continue to increase; if treatment is never given and the diet is not improved, there is also a danger to life.</p>
<p>Weakness, numbness, and pain can occur for many different reasons, and one cannot rely solely on one simple method to prevent the various diseases caused by many different reasons. The method discussed in this article specifically refers to the prevention of one disease caused by the same reason, that is, specifically refers to the prevention of so-called "beriberi." Many people mistakenly call a skin disease (commonly known as "athlete's foot") beriberi, so the words "weakness, numbness, and pain" are specially put forward to be eye-catching, which can avoid misunderstandings.</p>
<p>Not every symptom of weakness, numbness, and pain in every beriberi patient needs to be completely evident at the same time. The common initial symptoms are fatigue and weakness. During this period, the patient himself does not admit that he is sick, and others do not know that he is sick. Although the patient works as usual, the events of doing poorly and slow delays increase day by day, and the amount of work that can be done each day is reduced compared to before.</p>
<p>Feeling weak, easily fatigued, and unable to exert strength are very common symptoms of beriberi (this is not athlete's foot, which causes itching between the toes). During this period, according to ordinary people's views, it is not considered a disease, but the reduction in work efficiency has already caused economic losses in the career. Later, symptoms such as numbness and pain appear, and the work efficiency will naturally be further reduced, and the losses suffered in the career will naturally be greater.</p>
<p>In the past, many people in the Philippine and Japanese armies suffered from this disease. Later, the disease was completely prevented from appearing in the army by replacing white rice with brown rice (newly hulled grain that has not yet gone bad). Many people in the Philippines do not use brown rice instead of white rice, so this disease has not disappeared in the Philippines. The number of people who died from this disease in the Philippines in 1927 was more than 17,000, and in 1937 there were still more than 16,797 people. Calculating one death out of every ten patients, then the number of people in the Philippines who suffer from this disease every year is around 170,000, and the total number in ten years is more than 1.7 million.</p>
<p>Our Chinese population is dozens of times larger than the Philippines, and the number of people suffering from this disease, although there are no accurate statistics, is approximately several million annually. Taking only the initial patients with fatigue, weakness, numbness, and pain, the loss from these millions of illnesses is already alarming.</p>
<p>But these kinds of suffering from fatigue, weakness, numbness, and pain, and the resulting losses in career and work, all have simple and reliable prevention methods, which are easy to implement and do not require any expenditure. There are two prevention methods: (1) The rice porridge eaten at each meal should be cooked with steamed rice, not with raw rice (i.e., ordinary white rice); (2) Or use brown rice instead of white rice, that is, eat brown rice regularly.</p>
<p>The second method needs no explanation. In places that produce wheat but not rice, brown flour can be used to replace white flour. Brown flour (that is, black flour with bran and wheat germ) is cheaper than white flour, and the price of brown rice is definitely not more expensive than white rice, so this method does not require any increase in cost. If you dislike the roughness and it is not palatable, you can use steamed white rice from the first method.</p>
<h3>Method of Making Steamed Rice</h3>
<p>Farmers in Changxing County, Zhejiang Province, and many neighboring villages make steamed rice themselves in their spare time. The tools and methods used are common and simple. First, put a layer of rice straw (clean cloth is also acceptable) on the bottom of the steamer, put the unsoaked grain in the steamer (bamboo steamers can also be used to steam steamed buns and cakes), and put the steamer on top of the pot and steam it with the hot steam coming from the pot. After steaming for about an hour, take out the grain steamer, then bake it, dry it, and wind it to make the grain dry. After steaming, the grain should be dried quickly and completely. The dried steamed grain can be dehusked and debranned to make semi-brown or completely white steamed rice.</p>
<p>Changxing County and neighboring villages produce a lot of indica rice, so indica rice is used to make steamed rice, which is called cooked gluten or cooked rice grain when sold in rice shops. Unsteamed indica rice is called raw indica rice (raw rice). Each dou of cooked rice (that is, steamed rice) cooks into more white rice than each dou of raw rice (ordinary white rice) (cooking makes steamed rice expand more than raw rice). Therefore, although the price of steamed rice is slightly more expensive, steamed rice white rice is not slightly more expensive than ordinary white rice rice. Therefore, using steamed rice to increase public health does not require any daily expenditure.</p>
<p>Any high-quality or low-quality grain can be made into steamed rice. If the method of steaming whole grains is used to steam shelled wheat, then the health of the people in the northern provinces can be improved without adding any costs.</p>
<p>The Vitamin B1 in steamed white rice is still very rich, and it can definitely prevent the suffering of fatigue, numbness, and pain caused by "beriberi." All the advantages of brown rice and ordinary top-quality white rice are also fully possessed by steamed white rice, but without their disadvantages.</p>
<p>For thousands of years, many villages, towns, districts, and counties in Jiang, Zhejiang, and other provinces have had the custom of eating steamed rice, and since there is this fact in history and custom, it is easy to take advantage of the situation to promote the production, sales, and cooking of steamed rice. Promote it from dozens of villages, towns, and counties to thousands of cities and towns, and from Jiang and Zhejiang to all provinces in the country and major grain-producing countries in the world. People in big cities can entrust rice shops or relatives and friends in rural villages to order from the rural areas that produce steamed rice. Since there is a lot of demand, farmers are not worried about having no sales channels and will be willing to produce more steamed rice.</p>
<p>China has always had many production sites of steamed rice, scattered in many rural families. The manufacturing method is simple and does not require any machinery, equipment, capital, wages, etc. It is easy and effortless, and any farm family can steam it.</p>
<h3>Mental Patients are Also People</h3>
<p>— Xia Zhenyi</p>
<p>In the world, there are millions of men and women living in the abyss of pain. They can hear sounds that others cannot hear, and they can see images that other people's eyes cannot see. They can also think of many bizarre thoughts that are beyond reason. Sometimes they show smiles on the surface, but their hearts contain pain. Sometimes they are silent and calm, but their inner thoughts are like thousands of horses galloping, rising and falling, or filled with anxiety, fear, and doubt. Therefore, dignified people can become shameless, honest people can become deceitful, lively people become dull, and happy people become depressed.... In other words, their entire lives have deviated from the norms of reality and entered an uncontrollable fantasy realm. These people are the most unfortunate mental patients in the world. Even more unfortunate is that we have always given them a terrible name: "lunatics." The feeling generated from this name is terrible and contemptuous. Therefore, people not only do not sympathize with mental patients as they do with physical illnesses, but on the contrary, society's attitude towards mental patients is still inevitably cold, discriminatory, contemptuous, and inhumane. We should shout out loudly for them from a humanitarian standpoint: "Mental patients are also people."</p>
<p>Before the nineteenth century, everyone was superstitious that mental patients were possessed by demons and due to the punishment of the gods. Therefore, the treatment of mental patients was inhumane. At that time, so-called treatment was only imprisonment and abuse. They were imprisoned in wooden cages for life, tied with iron chains with rattles, and were often subjected to vicious beatings, isolated from society, and left to fend for themselves. It was like treating prisoners; no, it was simply not human life. It was truly as brutal as treating livestock. It was not until 1792 that Philippe Pinel began to implement the movement to release mental patients in Salpetriere, Paris. He removed the iron chains in the hospital and replaced them with humane treatment. Unfortunately, his power could not extend beyond the Paris area, but he vigorously refuted the erroneous view that mental illness was caused by demons and advocated using humane and compassionate methods to treat them, which influenced the attitude of ordinary people towards mental patients later on. Later, Miss Dorothea L. Dix in the United States continued to work hard and appeal on behalf of mental patients. As a result, 32 modern mental hospitals were established in California. From then on, the treatment of mental patients broke away from a tragic situation and gradually saw the dawn. In 1902, Clifford W. Beers, a Yale graduate in Connecticut, USA, suffered from mental illness and spent three years of inhumane life in public and private mental hospitals. He personally suffered all kinds of cruel and violent treatment from doctors and nurses in the hospital and witnessed the various sufferings of other patients. He was deeply moved. Therefore, after recovering from his illness and being discharged from the hospital, he vowed to dedicate the remaining years of his life to the general public of pitiful mental patients. He appealed to all parties and devoted his life to preventing mental illness. He also universally improved the treatment of mental patients and corrected the discriminatory attitude towards mental patients from the humanitarian standpoint of "mental patients are also people." He also wrote a masterpiece in vivid language about his life in the hospital—"A Mind That Found Itself." He is truly the originator of the mental health movement and the great benefactor of mental patients all over the world.</p>
<p>Although the wheels of the times have progressed to the atomic age today, mental patients in advanced European and American countries have been freed from the shackles of inhumane treatment and can receive scientific treatment like other diseases. Looking back at the situation in our country, how can we not feel heartbroken for millions of fellow citizens with mental illness! Many towns and cities still do not have a deep understanding of mental illness. Their methods of treatment still do not break away from the standards of the eighteenth century. They either seek gods and Buddhas, eat elixirs, or beat them violently to exorcise evil spirits and imprison them for life. I once saw with my own eyes in my hometown that a family of scholars for generations specially made wooden cages to imprison two generations of mental patients. What a tragic event this is! We can also see that people often spit at mental patients or throw stones at them, making all kinds of insulting gestures. Moreover, many families of patients believe that mental illness is shameful or that it is a misfortune for the family and damages their reputation. Therefore, they often secretly conceal it and do not give them a chance for treatment. But then again, this cannot be entirely blamed on the people. If one really wants to seek scientific treatment, one suffers from the lack of modern mental hospitals with complete equipment and scientific equipment. Not to mention remote towns and cities, even the limited number of beds in mental hospitals in Shanghai, a major city, how can all mental patients receive scientific gifts? In the public hospitals of advanced countries in Europe and the United States, the number of beds for mental patients often exceeds the total number of beds for other diseases.</p>
<p>Mental patients are unfortunate enough to have this painful disease, which is no different from other physical diseases. A person who has typhoid fever can do a career after a full recovery. Why can't a mental patient do a great and magnificent career after recovery? Mr. Beers is a perfect example. Both are "diseases," so what is there to be ashamed of or despise? On the contrary, we should give mental patients great sympathy. The facts tell us that mental illness is no longer as mysterious or terminal as previously imagined. In the progress of modern science, there is already a great hope of being cured. I hope that the families of mental patients will no longer be obsessed with superstition or imprison or discriminate against them, and should send them to scientific mental hospitals for treatment. I also hope that health authorities and people from all walks of life deeply feel the pain of "having a disease but nowhere to treat it" and universally establish modern mental hospitals. This is truly the greatest charitable cause and a necessary step to promote mental health work.</p>
<h3>The War Between Humans and Germs! (Continued to the End)</h3>
<p>— Excerpted from "Infectious Disease Management" by Qiao Shumin</p>
<p>Enhancing Resistance</p>
<p>Next, let's talk about resisting infection by invading germs—if the germs actually penetrate the mucous membrane or skin and enter the body, the defense of the reticuloendothelial system is very important. How the activity of phagocytic cells is sufficient to determine whether or not an infection is established. Unfortunately, we also do not know how to enhance this type of phagocytic activity. Generally speaking, the establishment of acute infection is largely due to the number and virulence of invading germs; while the establishment of chronic infection is mostly closely related to nutritional status. The so-called good nutrition not only refers to the appropriate preparation of food, but especially refers to the coordination of various factors (such as fatigue, exercise, air, sunlight, etc.) that affect metabolism.</p>
<p>According to the recent research of Soviet scientist Bogomolets, injecting a small amount of anti-reticular cytotoxic serum can enhance the phagocytic activity of reticular cells.</p>
<p>(10) Generation of Special Resistance – Vaccination</p>
<p>The use of vaccination to generate special resistance is truly the greatest invention and contribution of modern humans. We are not yet able to prevent all infectious diseases with vaccines. The effectiveness of each vaccination is also often not completely reliable or lasting. Everything is still in continuous research and progress. The practical vaccination methods can be classified as follows:</p>
<p>B Active Immunization - Using vaccines to stimulate immunity.</p>
<p>A. Using weakened live germs as vaccines:</p>
<p>(1) Vaccinia Virus – Vaccination to prevent smallpox.</p>
<p>(2) Tick-borne disease prevention vaccine.</p>
<p>(3) Yellow fever prevention vaccine.</p>
<p>(4) Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG)</p>
<p>B. Using killed germs as vaccines:</p>
<p>(1) Typhoid prevention vaccine (should be made from strains containing V1 antigen)</p>
<p>(2) Cholera prevention vaccine.</p>
<p>(3) Plague prevention vaccine.</p>
<p>(4) Pneumonia prevention vaccine.</p>
<p>(5) Tetanus prevention vaccine.</p>
<p>(6) Pertussis prevention vaccine.</p>
<p>A. Using bacterial toxins or antigens as vaccines.</p>
<p>(1) Diphtheria prevention vaccine – Toxin, toxoid, alum-precipitated toxoid.</p>
<p>(2) Scarlet fever prevention vaccine.</p>
<p>2. Passive Immunization – Using serum containing antibodies, injected into the human body, can immediately produce short-term immunity, but it disappears quickly in the body. Therefore, it is only suitable for temporary use in people who already have an infection or are at risk of infection.</p>
<p>A. Using animal serum:</p>
<p>(1) Anti-diphtheria serum.</p>
<p>(2) Anti-scarlet fever serum.</p>
<p>(3) Anti-tetanus serum.</p>
<p>B. Using serum from recovered patients:</p>
<p>(1) Serum from people who have had measles.</p>
<p>(2) Serum from people who have had chickenpox.</p>
<p>(3) Convalescent pertussis serum.</p>
<p>(4) Convalescent mumps serum.</p>
<p>(5) Convalescent poliomyelitis serum</p>
<p>C. Mixed Active and Passive Immunization - For example, the injection of a mixture of diphtheria toxin and antitoxin, or the late injection of serum from patients who have recovered from measles.</p>
<p>Vaccination is very effective in preventing and controlling the epidemic of certain infectious diseases. When a certain infectious disease occurs, if susceptible contacts are all vaccinated and obtain immunity, the epidemic will not occur. Even if not all can be vaccinated, as long as half of them receive it, the effect of preventing the occurrence of epidemics is also very considerable. The ten items on the right are the general steps for managing infectious diseases, which are the only way to win against germs. How to use it flexibly depends on the person and also varies with the nature of the disease.</p>

<p>Spring and Autumn</p>
<h3>My Understanding of Zhang Daqian</h3>
<p>— Lu Danlin</p>
<p>It has been seven years since I last saw Daqian. This time, Daqian came to Shanghai from Chengdu, and we met for the first time. His opening words stunned me. "Yes, in the autumn of the 27th year of the Republic (1938), Daqian was in Hong Kong, about to return to Sichuan. He was with my brother Xiao Dan, both guests in Hong Kong. The next day, I would also depart for Guilin, alone. We agreed to meet again between the Sword Pavilion and Mount Qingcheng, to laugh together over this painting."</p>
<p>Later, they indeed met again in Sichuan. In the summer of the 33rd year of the Republic (1944), Daqian sent his nephews, students, and disciples to hold a large-scale exhibition of copies of the Dunhuang murals in Chongqing. After the event, my family and they took a car to Chengdu, but I alone remained in Chongqing and did not go to Chengdu. Hence, Daqian's question was justified. To be honest, during my years in Chongqing, I worked successively at the Highway Administration of the Ministry of Transportation and the Wartime Transportation Administration of the Military Affairs Commission. It would have been very convenient to take a car to Chengdu if I had wanted to, but I didn't want to travel without a special reason. Therefore, for three years in Sichuan, I merely resided in a corner of the mountain city.</p>
<p>Last autumn, in September, I returned to Shanghai from Chongqing. Many friends saw me, and although I hadn't met with Daqian, news was frequently exchanged, and many friends traveled back and forth, so I knew a lot. Furthermore, Daqian went to Hong Kong twice after the war, and we met almost every day, so I can say a few things about him.</p>
<p>This time, Daqian's arrival in Shanghai has led some publications to spread untrue news, out of ignorance. Some say he painted dozens of tigers, others say he brought two or three wives, and some say his life is very difficult. These are all fabrications, made by people who don't know Daqian at all. Daqian never paints tigers; the one who paints tigers is his second brother, Shanzhi, who passed away in the 29th year of the Republic (1940). This time, Daqian came to Shanghai alone; his family is still in Chengdu. To say his life is difficult is even more contrary to the truth. Although Shen Yinmo once jokingly said Daqian was "rich enough to rival a nation, yet poor enough to have no place to stand," this is another aspect of the matter and certainly doesn't refer to Daqian's lifestyle. Because for over forty years, Daqian has never put money in his heart. Since some people in society don't understand Daqian, I, standing on the basis of a twenty-year friendship, will talk about Daqian, perhaps without much misunderstanding.</p>
<p>Daqian is a man of extraordinary talent, with unparalleled intelligence. He is not only skilled in calligraphy and painting, but also in poetry and lyrics, and in seal carving. He is truly versatile. He is fond of lavish spending. If he likes something, he will spend a thousand gold coins without hesitation. Sometimes he may not have a penny on him, but if he encounters a famous painting, even if it is worth a high price, he will first secure it and then find a way to raise the funds for the transaction. Therefore, the famous paintings he has acquired over the years are abundant and exquisite. Dealers, knowing his expertise in authentication and his generosity in offering high prices, often send him famous paintings for appreciation and purchase first. The many masterpieces in the Dafengtang collection came about in this way.</p>
<p>He is also very particular about food, especially Sichuan and Cantonese cuisine. He is skilled in cooking, and whenever distinguished guests arrive, he often goes into the kitchen to personally prepare dishes for them. (Jiang Yiyun wrote in the second poem of my scroll of Daqian's painting of Zhao Yaosheng: "Zhang with the beautiful beard has a great reputation, after returning from Dunhuang, his brush is even more outstanding; unforgettable is the night of listening to the rain in Xiao Qi, he personally cooks the river fish." This also refers to him personally preparing dishes.) He likes to eat ice cream, and year-round, he can eat many cups at a time. Ten years ago, he often spent more than a dollar on ice cream, and paid three dollars for the taxi fare, without caring at all. He doesn't smoke or drink normally, but when he meets good friends for a good conversation, he can drink several pounds of wine bowl after bowl without showing any signs of intoxication. When traveling, he always chooses first-class accommodations on ships, trains, and hotels. His clothes are plain, and he wears cloth socks all year round, but his enjoyment is extremely luxurious. He always tries his best to help relatives and friends in urgent need. If he is short of money, he will immediately write a calligraphy piece and have someone exchange it for cash. Sometimes, to help a friend who needs a loan urgently, or for a larger sum, he will pawn a few of his collected masterpieces to get money for his friend. This kind of willingness to help others in their time of need is very rare.</p>
<p>He canceled his painting price list more than ten years ago. Usually, when outsiders ask him to paint, if there is no special relationship, he often refuses to paint, even if a generous fee is offered. Even if someone introduces them, it is common for the request to be put aside for a year or two. However, when he is in a good mood, he can often complete several paintings in one go within just a few hours. Especially at gatherings with happy guests, with wine flowing freely, he would talk and write, painting landscapes, flowers, birds, figures, and characters as the mood strikes him, painting and inscribing as he goes, truly embodying the spirit of "hands waving five fingers, eyes following flying geese." If you are his good friend, you can find opportunities to ask him to paint at any time, and he will not refuse. And the paintings he gives to friends are mostly masterpieces. Among his former friends, the first to be mentioned is the late Cen Yucen. The scrolls, fans, and albums I have of his paintings add up to dozens. Unfortunately, some of them were lost due to the war in Shanghai and Hong Kong. He often said, "The most precious thing in life is friendship, especially with friends who appreciate my works. What is money worth? If money were precious, I could now be a millionaire with countless riches." Yes, the amount of money that has passed through his hands is truly immeasurable.</p>
<p>The actions of Daqian, the man with the beautiful beard, are very genuine and unrestrained, and also very humorous. He was originally a Christian, but in his youth, due to a love entanglement, he became a monk at the Songjiang Chanding Temple for a few months. He still uses "Daqian Jushi" (Daqian Lay Buddhist) to sign his works. He loves to travel. Once the idea strikes him, he thinks of the grandeur of nature, intimately engaging with the scenery and accumulating inspiration. He also possesses a wealth of artistic talent bestowed by nature. Combined with continuous hard work, he has been able to achieve his current accomplishments. In his Dafengtang studio, he treasures over a thousand pieces of famous paintings from past dynasties, broadly surveying the works of various masters, without adhering to any particular style or school, and diligently studying all of them. In particular, he has grasped the secrets of Shi Tao, Bada Shanren, Shi Xi, Jianjiang, Dafeng, Dong Xin, and Xin Luo, integrating and synthesizing them, extracting the essence of the ancients and discarding their dross. Every stroke is conceived before it is executed, and the spirit merges with the ancients. His brushwork is unrestrained and vigorous, with a rich, thick, and moist style, melting together the Northern and Southern schools in one furnace, creating his own unique path. This is reaching the pinnacle of artistic transformation, without any trace of constraint. Furthermore, for the past twenty years, he has traveled to famous mountains and rivers both domestically and abroad... Wherever his footsteps have taken him, he has sought out the true charm of wind and rain in remote mountain valleys, on precipitous cliffs, in ancient temples with tall pines, adopting the scenery of nature to use as material for his paintings. As Shi Tao said, "Search exhaustively for strange peaks to make drafts." Therefore, his paintings, in all aspects of layout and color, are ingenious and unique, directly taking nature as his teacher, writing out the cosmic realm in his heart. As Yun Nantian said in his postscript to the Ouxiangguan paintings, "Every blade of grass, every tree, every hill, every ravine, is uniquely opened up by spiritual imagination."...</p>
<p>Daqian's skill in copying ancient paintings is truly ghostly in its accuracy. His copies of Qing Teng, Bai Yang, Shi Tao, Bada Shanren, Shi Xi, Lao Yun, Dong Xin, and Xin Luo are indeed indistinguishable from the originals. Especially his imitations of Shi Tao are the most famous. Not only are the brushwork, spirit, and charm of the paintings identical to Shi Tao's genuine works, but the inscriptions, seals, inkpads, and paper quality are also meticulously replicated, seamless and flawless. However, he treats it as a playful exercise, and in front of friends, he never conceals it. Yet, art dealers and collectors who love antiquity, upon acquiring a slightly refined Shi Tao painting, cannot help but wonder if "this was made by Daqian." Indeed, Daqian's works in the style of Shi Tao have spread throughout the world, confounding foreign collectors. Originally, using fakes to deceive the real is a cunning trick of artists, and it can also be used for amusement in conversations among friends, which is not to be taken as a lesson. However, to learn Chinese painting, one must first copy the ancients, and to copy the ancients, one must strive for accurate and subtle likenesses that can deceive the eye. This is an indispensable stage in learning to paint and cannot be ignored, as it is said, "Reviewing the old allows one to understand the new." However, in recent years, Daqian's style has changed. Those former works imitating ancient paintings are merely an indelible page in his life's journey, a game in the world.</p>
<p>How did Daqian's painting style change? It was during his long journey to Dunhuang, where, in the confluence of Chinese and foreign art, he immersed himself in painting for several years. This transformation led his style to shift from Shi Tao, Bada Shanren, Shi Xi, and Lao Yun to the art of the Six Dynasties and the Tang Dynasty. This kind of sublime and magnificent painting truly proclaims his fame in the desert and paints the world in glorious colors. In the history of Chinese painting, besides Daqian, there has not been a second person to date. Because even if someone has his ambition, they may not have his ability, and even if they have his ambition and ability, they may not have his genius and thought to integrate and apply them. Therefore, Daqian's uniqueness cannot but be said to make him a special figure in the contemporary art world.</p>
<p>A few days ago, I talked with Ye Xiaweng (Gongchuo) about Daqian's paintings. Xiaweng said, "Daqian should focus on figure painting in the future, because there are no figure painters in the contemporary era. And figure painting is originally the most important in Chinese painting. Daqian has the genius for painting and profound attainments, and having lived in Dunhuang for many years, he should give full play to his strengths, bring a unique brilliance to the modern Chinese art scene, and continue its glorious history." Xiaweng knows Daqian very well, and these words are indeed a fair assessment. I share this opinion and write it down specifically as the conclusion to this article.</p>
<h3>Zhang Daqian in Modern Painting History</h3>
<p>— Zheng Wuchang</p>
<p>According to the method of having no method, the method of having no method is established by myself, the method of having method is obtained by myself, obtaining the method of others and using it for my own purposes, establishing my own method so that others cannot reach it, then there is nowhere that I cannot go, and there is nothing that I cannot do well, this is a master. In the past, painting philosophers such as Gu, Lu, Cao, Wu, Jing, Guan, Dong, Ju, Liu, Li, Mi, Guo, Ma, Xia, Huang, Wang, Ni, Wu, Wen, Shen, Tang, Dong, and also Bada Shanren, Shi Tao, recommended as masters of their generation, all obtained the methods of others and established their own methods, exhausted the changes of man and nature, and made pioneering and succeeding contributions. Since the Four Wangs crowned the painting garden in the Qing Dynasty, scholars have flocked under their prestigious names; or those who create new styles are often regarded as strange. For hundreds of years, there have been many who copied, and few who created. There are those who practiced the method of a certain school and called themselves superior; but there are very few who collected the methods of others and made themselves a family. Brother Daqian the Eighth has embraced the ambition of surpassing the ancients, and has the talent of surpassing the world, disdaining to follow the customs of likes and dislikes. He initially carried forward and greatly expanded the style of Bada Shanren and Shi Tao, which historians regarded as strange, shaking the recent painting world; he opened a new face in the corrupt and decadent customs. Then he collected the methods of the great masters of the Tang, Song, Yuan, and Ming dynasties to write about the natural scenery wherever his travels led him, magnificent and majestic, to show my method. Recently, in addition to silk, he traced the source of painting, spending years of hard work, traveling to the remote borders, and searching and copying the murals in the Dunhuang caves; he was familiar with the methods of material selection, composition, brushwork, and coloring of the painters of the Six Dynasties and the Sui and Tang Dynasties, obtained them in his hand, understood them in his heart, followed the ancients, and innovated in the present, so his works flashed with the high antiquity of the past. Daqian himself said, "Sitting in the courtyard of the Six Dynasties, entering the hall of the Sui and Tang Dynasties." With this ambition, with this courage, and with this skill, there may be no second person in hundreds of years. It is truly no exaggeration to place him in the ranks of the ancient masters. Recently, Daqian exhibited his recent works at the Chinese Painting Academy, with more than eighty landscape, figure, flower, and bird paintings. I wonder if those who know will use my words to question him, what do you think?</p>
<h3>Autumn·Lyrical</h3>
<p>— Hu Yingdong</p>
<p>Autumn is the season of prose, but facing this city filled with poisonous mist, I have long lost this prose mood.</p>
<p>Life has gnawed away at my heart, and every day, when I dissect myself from the mechanical and monotonous lifestyle, I always return with a wounded and weary heart.</p>
<p>Humanity is submerged, youth is sold off cheaply, there is no freedom of will, no heartfelt laughter, strangeness and hypocrisy swirl around me, and autumn, with a mocking silence, has crept close to my side.</p>
<p>I loathe it, I want to leave here, to rush to the countryside, to stand proudly on a hill, to roar at the clouds and sky, to open my heart and sing aloud, not allowing even a speck of dust to stain my soul, nor allowing demons to dance before my eyes.</p>
<p>When real life knocks on my head, I know how far away this realm is from me.</p>
<p>Autumn, the autumn here is a velvet fashion on a fashionable lady, the seductive smile of a goddess on a street corner, the overflowing aroma of roasted chestnuts from Liangxiang,</p>
<p>Besides that, besides that, I can't find anything else.</p>
<p>In the autumn wind, I see forced smiles hanging on people's lips, nestling for love beside gold bars, burning in people's bodies. People are just like that. From here, I unearth the emotions of twentieth-century humanity.</p>
<p>Autumn, how profound you are, how worldly-wise, but I have already determined that your fate will be a deathly silent winter, a petrified mummy!?</p>
<h3>Plum Bamboo</h3>
<p>— Zhang Daqian</p>
<h3>In Praise of the Daqian Lay Buddhist</h3>
<p>— Xu Shiqi</p>
<p>The Daqian Lay Buddhist has traveled widely within the universe, visiting famous mountains and writing prolifically, a treasure to the art world. During the War of Resistance, he settled in Chengdu (the people of Sichuan return to Sichuan, not "Chongqing people"). He once traveled far to Qinghai, exploring the beauty of Dunhuang, and painted murals that are magnificent and exquisite, aiming to restore the legacy of the Tang Dynasty and promote the spirit of the Renaissance in Eastern art, a truly heroic undertaking.</p>
<p>The other day, I visited with Brother Hufan, and it was very lively, with Zu Han, Jekan, Zhiliu, and others engaging in lively discussions. Daqian said that in recent years, prices have skyrocketed, and the income from a painting is not enough to cover the cost of a feast, so he plans to change his profession to become a chef, showcasing his skills. A guest suggested that he could open a Dunhuang restaurant in Shanghai, selling Buddha's Foot Ice Cream. (In the Dunhuang grottoes, it is extremely cold under the feet of the Buddha statues, and water drips and freezes into ice. Daqian loves to indulge in ice cream, consuming four or five cups at a time.) Daqian was already thinking of this twenty years ago, and today his style is still the same as before, truly a black-haired old man pretending to be young.</p>
<p>He traveled widely to the borderlands, and the magnificent rivers and mountains are collected in his paintings;</p>
<p>For years, he painted murals in the Dunhuang caves, and returning to Jiangnan, his hair is not yet white.</p>
<h3>One Inch of Mountains and Rivers, One Inch of Blood 100</h3>
<p>— Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>Therefore, Tsurumi Michitoki not only didn't want to joke around with these desperate men, but also took special care and caution; although he didn't run away, he temporarily forgot the fatigue of the past two days, secretly quickened his pace, and prepared to seize an opportunity to execute a golden cicada shedding its skin, to avoid this trouble. Who knew that as Tsurumi quickened his pace here, the six men chasing after him got even closer.</p>
<p>Seeing that the situation was not right, Tsurumi loosened his tie and unbuttoned a few buttons on his vest, muttering to himself, "I didn't expect to get so hot just walking a few steps." As he spoke, he suddenly took off the tightly wrapped tuxedo and draped it over his wrist. All these preparations were to avoid being restrained by these clothes when it came to fighting.</p>
<p>The "dang mi chan" who was preparing to fight the enemy looked ahead and caught sight of a Western-style bar a few dozen steps away, still brightly lit. Knowing that it was still open after the Ginza and theater crowds had dispersed, he suddenly had an idea. He immediately slowed down and buttoned up his buttons and tie as he walked, leaving only the tuxedo draped over his wrist. When he reached a few steps from the bar, he stopped, first measuring the lights and signs of the bar, as if he wanted to record the location, and then looked at the opposite street and both ends. In fact, he wanted to see how the guys following him would act. Little did he know that as soon as he turned around, he saw that the road was deserted, with only the slightly swaying shadows of trees and telephone poles, and not even a ghost in sight.</p>
<p>Tsurumi knew that the guys following him had anticipated that he would go to the bar, so they had hidden in advance. Tsurumi thought, "Well, it's good to rest in this bar for a while, and see how things go after I recover some strength." Thinking this, he put on his tuxedo again.</p>
<p>Although this bar didn't look special on the outside, as soon as you stepped on the stairs, you knew it was a gorgeous and thoroughly Western-style lounge dance hall. There was no fancy decoration on the outside, only the two words "New Green" were embedded artistically on the lintel. Tsurumi first rearranged his tuxedo and tie, and the guard at the door bowed and opened the door a crack. Because there was air-conditioning, people were waiting to greet guests all the way through the triple doors.</p>
<p>Tsurumi left his hat and didn't take a seat, but first went to make a phone call, calling the "Eikawa" inn where he was staying to send someone to Ueno Park to pick up his car. After leaving the phone booth, he told the usher who was waiting that he wanted to find a comfortable seat without having to have someone accompany him for drinks and dances; Japanese people only rest. He also told him to notify the door that if his car came, the driver should come to the hall to let him know.</p>
<p>This lounge dance hall was a beautiful and magnificent scene; the lighting, decoration, seats, and dance floor were arranged very beautifully, and the colors were harmonious. Even after midnight, the male and female customers were still quite crowded. At this time, the music station was playing the popular Western-style music made in Japan, "Maiden's Spring." Couples were already gathering in twos and threes on the dance floor, following the music and taking tango steps. Apart from the light and slow playing of the music, there wasn't even the sound of coughing. The Japanese had mastered the "quiet" mantra very successfully, which was also rare.</p>
<p>Tsurumi had been out of touch with the social life of Tokyo for five or six years, so at this time, seeing everything in this lounge, he was surprised at the speed of progress, but also felt very uneasy, because in his mind, he was still continuously seeing the various war reports from the Changxindian radio station, the Japanese soldiers rushing and breaking into the area of Beiping, the roaring of Japanese artillery, and the compatriots in the Northeast who had been trampled under the feet of the Japanese for several years, planning to slaughter and plunder China, and so on. But here in Tokyo, the origin of all the atrocities, it was so quiet, with melodious songs and graceful dances, as peaceful as the moon palace. The soldiers who had not yet been sent to the front, and some bureaucrats, politicians, gentlemen, ladies, and socialites, all had quiet smiles on their faces, as if there was no such thing as aggression and slaughter in the world.</p>

<h3>Mad Love</h3>
<p>— Shaofu</p>
<p>Recently, our city screened "Mad Love," starring Gene Tierney and Cornel Wilde. The English original title of this film is "Leave Her to Heaven." Many friends who have seen it say it's good. The reason it is good is that it fully depicts a woman's psychology of intense love for a man, developed to the extreme, and resulting in a love state.</p>
<p>Some men feel overwhelmed by the complete possessiveness of their wives and cannot stand it, even though they deeply understand the other party's love and are moved by it. However, in the real world (not the Garden of Eden of Adam and Eve), how can a man give all his time and all his mind to his wife? Even if he is willing, it is actually difficult to do.</p>
<p>Therefore, men who encounter this situation—unable to accept the kindness—may suffer as much as the women who offer it but are denied.</p>
<p>Regardless of gender, a person always has a "corner of their soul." This corner, besides oneself, even if two people are together day and night, step by step, the concepts formed in their respective conscious domains in response to the outside world are not necessarily connected, not necessarily able to face each other completely naked. This is also a kind of tragedy in humanity. Therefore, mutual possession between the sexes ultimately has its limits.</p>
<h3>Overwhelmed by the Feelings of Past and Present · New York City Has Declined</h3>
<p>— Erjun</p>
<p>An old New Yorker, Mr. Walker, a famous journalist, recently published an article in the newspaper, stating that life in New York is not as good as before, making him tired of it, and he wants to leave New York and go to a quiet place with beautiful mountains and rivers to enjoy the remaining years of his life.</p>
<p>The first thing that makes him feel headache is that the items and amounts of donations and taxes are increasing. The finances of New York City have long been a troublesome problem, and now it is getting worse and worse, almost to the point of exhaustion and unsolvable. The new mayor, Mr. O'Dwyer, although a famous administrator, has to plan for a new source of funds of 80 million US dollars as soon as he takes office. From a purely external point of view, the city is simply suffocating and making it impossible to breathe. The tunnels are overcrowded and have been around for a long time, and they also need to be repaired and cleaned. The bus system is gradually deteriorating; the service of business cars does not seem to be as convenient as before. Street traffic is getting worse and worse, and the problem of parking is simply unsolvable; although the city authorities have stipulated many rules for adjusting traffic, they are of little help in fact. These municipal affairs all need money to handle, so as soon as the new mayor takes office, he is immediately busy with ways to increase revenue, and as a result, the tax burden on citizens is increased.</p>
<p>Because the cost of living in New York City is high, her many industries cannot compete with the industries in cities with lower costs of living. Now the real seat of financial power is in Washington. Although the city authorities want to turn New York City into the "fashion center" of the world, the fashion industry is no longer what it used to be and has moved to California and even Texas.</p>
<p>It is not easy to live here. The housing shortage is also an urgent problem, and this problem cannot be improved in the short term. The crime rate is increasing day by day, and walking on the streets at night is not as peaceful as it used to be. Life is getting more and more complicated; strikes, strikes, are heard every day, making residents uneasy and unable to live in peace. According to some experts, given the current trend of increasingly advanced air transport, New York City may soon fall behind Chicago and no longer be the largest city in the United States.</p>
<p>As for entertainment and culture, the situation is also much worse than before. Although on the surface it is still as lively as ever, the essence has changed. Apart from some pornographic entertainment, the places of elegant recreation are decreasing day by day. People's attitudes, their dealings with others, have also changed. The enthusiasm and friendliness of the past, like the spirit of a family, have now disappeared without a trace. Now people all have cold faces, and apart from talking business and thinking of ways to earn other people's money, there is no friendship or sympathy. If there is, it is only hypocrisy.</p>
<p>Tragicomedy. No matter what the trend will be tomorrow, this is a definite fact, and this fact has been around for a long time and has not been changed by the war, that is, New York City has become a place that is not easy to live and work in. Coming to this city for travel, you cannot enjoy any comfort. Her spirit, her personality, and her important feelings have been declining day by day, especially in the last ten years or so. The face of life that New York City presents is just a tragicomic farce.</p>
<p>Tired of it. Mr. Walker came to New York City in 1919 and lived there. He is willing to go to a quiet place to raise some white-faced cattle, red-haired pigs, and black sheep, grow sweet potatoes and peppers, chop wood, and read old novels under the lamp in the evening, and listen to classical music (broadcast on the radio) in the blue sky. He doesn't want to talk much unless he finds someone who understands him. And the thing he cherishes most is being able to enjoy the freedom in life.</p>
<p>Why not return home? I have lived in Shanghai for almost twenty years and I am also tired of life in Shanghai. I long for the life in my hometown, where there is the distant view of Mount Lu and the tranquility of Gan Tang Lake. People who live in Shanghai! In this city full of dust, expensive goods, and housing panic, what is worth lingering in Shanghai? Your fields will be overgrown with weeds, why not return home?</p>
<h3>Following Others' Cries</h3>
<p>— Wen</p>
<p>Mr. Zhu Jingnong attended a volunteer spiritual retreat organized by the YMCA the other day and delivered a speech titled "Psychological Construction of China." He said with deep sorrow, "The worst flaw in the Chinese character is 'blind obedience,' which is also 'parrot fashion.'" He further cited an example, saying that recently there have been calls for the withdrawal of American troops from China. However, there are only over three thousand American soldiers in China, and these three thousand are not even concentrated in one place. Meanwhile, a certain country's troops in Dalian alone exceed fifteen thousand. Is it possible that these scattered three thousand are more harmful than the fifteen thousand concentrated in one place? Why is it that people are only clamoring for the withdrawal of American troops while no one is clamoring for a certain country's troops to withdraw from China?"</p>
<p>After listening to Mr. Zhu's words, I can't help but advise those impassioned friends that, regardless of whether they support foreign troops staying or leaving, it is best to make their own decisions. Following others' cries is no different from belittling oneself! Besides, "others" have their own calculations!</p>
<h3>Tram Transformation into Train</h3>
<p>— Yu</p>
<p>Shanghai's trams have already "transformed into trains." If you don't believe me, please see the reasons below:</p>
<p>1. We often see that no trams come for a long time, and then, after one comes, there are a dozen or so linked together. This is "train-like" in form.</p>
<p>2. Some trams don't stop at some stations and do stop at others; these are "special express trains."</p>
<p>3. Some trams don't stop at any station after they start; these are "direct trains."</p>
<p>4. There are also Route 2 trams that switch to Route 1 signs midway on their return trip; these are "local trains."</p>
<p>5. Some terminal stations don't pick up passengers, and only pick them up at the station one or two stops after the terminal; this is like "boarding at the West Station."</p>
<h3>Anonymous</h3>
<p>— Saintly</p>
<p>Often, there are people who donate money but do not wish to seek empty fame, and therefore cannot be named, so they are called "Anonymous."</p>
<p>In the 30th year of the Republic [1941], a 26-year-old young writer wrote a book called "The Love of Lucia." After its publication, sales were poor, and he felt depressed and disappeared from the literary scene, immersing himself in arduous self-cultivation for two years. In the 32nd year of the Republic [1943], he wrote two novels in Xi'an with a tentative approach: "Arctic Scenery Sketches" and "The Woman in the Tower." Because the book he wrote two years ago did not sell well, he no longer dared to use his previous pen name, so he simply used "Anonymous" as his pen name. In his original intention, he felt that his literary attainment was not deep enough to reveal his true identity lightly. Unexpectedly, these two books became bestsellers in the rear area. Young readers in Xi'an, Chongqing, Kunming, Lanzhou, and other places all appreciated them. Thus, "Anonymous" became "Famous."</p>
<p>After the victory [end of WWII], Anonymous bid farewell to the readers in the rear area, and even a single piece of news could not be heard. Recently, suddenly discovered an author on a certain evening newspaper in this city, also named Anonymous. But according to what I know, Anonymous specifically said to the writer after finishing those two novels that he would no longer publish articles in newspapers. If you wanted to read his articles, it would have to be in book form. Sure enough, received a letter from Anonymous yesterday, saying that he is currently in Hangzhou, writing a long novel of 1.8 million characters, titled "Beasts! Beasts! Beasts!" Based on this, it can be known that this "Anonymous" is not that "Anonymous."</p>
<p>What interests me here is that the author of "Arctic Scenery Sketches" gained "fame" by using "Anonymous," which shows that the achievement of an article still lies in the article itself. As long as the article is good, Anonymous will also become Famous; conversely, if the article is not good, then "Famous" will also become truly Anonymous.</p>
<p>Also, although using the three characters "Anonymous" as a pen name is very clever, these three characters are very similar in nature to titles like "To Be Determined," and are often plagiarized (such as the Anonymous discovered in a certain evening newspaper). Therefore, Mr. Anonymous (referring to the author of "Arctic Scenery Sketches"), should he add an annotation after Anonymous, to completely reveal his true face?</p>
<h3>Low Profile</h3>
<p>— Hecao</p>
<p>Conscription, Hide-and-Seek, Too Absurd</p>
<p>Recently, many people from the countryside have fled to Shanghai because the government is conscripting soldiers. However, the average person from the countryside simply doesn't know what conscription means, only that it is called drawing strong men, and that being drawn means going to war, and war means death. So, they are fleeing and hiding, and buying substitutes is also often heard of, which is very harmful during this harvest season. Furthermore, some officials think that there is an opportunity to take advantage of this, so they stir up trouble, taking the opportunity to search and extort, giving themselves a big fattening up.</p>
<p>I think special efforts should be made in publicity work! It is also reported that there are so many unemployed or jobless vagrants in Shanghai, that the government not drawing them to train them is truly killing two birds with one stone.</p>
<p>Recently, on the streets, one can often see a jeep, with several police officers sitting inside, "cruising," catching vendors. The results are indeed satisfactory, with the vendors fleeing at the sight of the vehicle. But as soon as they leave, those vendors gather again from street corners, secluded alleys, or other places, and continue to do their business as usual. This situation is like playing hide-and-seek, truly amusing!</p>
<p>Ten-wheeled trucks have always been rushing and ramming in the city, displaying their power, and the common people have always been accustomed to being bullied. They swallow their anger and dare not say a word? Unexpectedly, not long ago, this "atomic tiger" launched its power on North Sichuan Road and crashed the mayor's car. Fortunately, Mayor Wu was "magnanimous" and said, "As long as he comes down and says hello, I won't ask him to pay." But the unappreciative military truck ran away, no wonder the mayor was angry and said he would investigate and deal with it severely, probably to give him a hard time, otherwise what is the use of investigating? The mayor also said, "This is too absurd, this is too disorderly." But the mayor may not know that it has long been too absurd, and long been too disorderly, but what can we common people do?</p>
<h3>San Mao</h3>

<h3>Escaped from Hell</h3>
<p>— Yang Ren</p>
<p>Who would have known that a drug addict must go through so much hardship and pain to swim out of the Black Sea? Here is the experience of a friend who has now broken his addiction:</p>
<p>Quitting smoking has three difficulties: first laziness, second thoughts, and third clearing out the residue. Laziness and thoughts are just feeling uncomfortable, as for clearing out the residue, that is really a matter of life and death. Because of economic reasons, I used the gradual reduction method of diluting Lin Shiba medicine wine. After a month, I finally succeeded, but my spirit was listless, and I had no interest in anything. Even if there were many gold bars and silver ingots piled up outside the door, just stooping down would give you them. However, I would rather miss this good opportunity and lie still, really not even the energy to raise my hand and move my feet! The laziness is evident.</p>
<p>Although nominally I quit, I still constantly think of this "gentleman" [opium], truly lingering. In dreams, if I could meet him again at that time, it would be easiest to renew old friendships.</p>
<p>Do you know what "clearing out the residue" is like? Strangely enough, after about four months, people said that I was fatter than before, and my family members were also convinced that I had completely broken my addiction. One day, I went to the street for the first time since quitting smoking. Passing by my old "opium den," I couldn't help but feel a great desire and, regardless of the months of hard work, ran in, eager to kiss "her fragrance." Many old friends offered endless hospitality. Ah! I really want to thank that senior "old hand" [opium smoker], who actually said to me: "I am old and have no way! You are young, and you have already broken free, why do you want to come again? Isn't this wasting all your hard work!" At that time, I had already loaded the pipe, ready to "import" [smoke], but hearing these words, my conscience was discovered, so I put down the opium pipe, took out the appropriate amount of currency, threw it on the kang [heated platform], considered it a meeting fee, and left without a word. Before I got home, I only felt dizzy, the sky spinning and the earth turning, a wave of nausea, vomited uncontrollably, and collapsed. I fainted, and when I woke up, I was already in my bed at home.</p>
<p>What do you think I vomited? It turned out to be a big pile of black, thick, sticky "old paste" scraped from an eagle's stomach! After this vomiting, the poison was finally cleared out, although I was sick for another month or so, but from then on, I broke off old relationships and never thought of longing again. Do you see this last hurdle, is it strange or not? Difficult or not?</p>
<p>Now, at a time when the clearing of opium poison is being repeatedly emphasized, I see that those who are deeply immersed in the Black Sea will all ascend to the path of light. I am writing this "experience talk" to provide readers with conversation aid!</p>
