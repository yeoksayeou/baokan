<h3>蘇軍行動撲朔迷離　瀋陽混亂共軍活躍　東大營北陵兩處被佔</h3>
<p>〔本報重慶十日電〕東北局勢惡化聲中，軍人中之中委，對於東北軍事措置，頗多異議，咸有主張加强軍事人事之意。聞於二中全會中，曾有提議改派陳誠赴東北之議。聞陳氏本人，對此並無意見，最高當局對此建議，或將允予考慮。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦十日廣播稱：蘇軍退出瀋陽後，中央軍隊已與中共軍隊發生衝突。</p>
<p>〔本報長春九日電〕昨午迄今，又有蘇軍車多輛，自瀋北開。車站已解嚴，客車亦恢復行駛。城東北南共軍甚活躍，有乘虛而入企圖。鐵嶺通源等地，共軍近日兼程南進，大部已到達瀋北之二台子一帶，惟我軍甚具信心，決不致輕棄防地。最近三日間，城區空出之建築物甚多，均隨時由市府派警看守。城南之渺沱鐵橋，昨已由我接防。自蘇軍開始撤退以來，此為我軍惟一之接防活動。北陵警察分局，昨晚曾遭匪徒攻擊，結果被逐退。蘇軍之行動，一般雖不無迷惑之感，然刻已開始離去此間，則毫無可疑。</p>
<p>〔本報長春九日電〕瀋陽蘇軍移動聲中，此間於今晨九時起，迄晚止，街頭陸續發現蘇軍多起，似自他處新來者。其中間或有砲車坦克，惟此多起蘇軍，是否即爲由瀋來者，刻尙無從證實。據息：瀋陽僅北城尙有蘇軍。</p>
<p>〔中央社長春十日電〕九日午後至十日午前九時，共有六列滿載蘇軍及軍需品之軍用車，由瀋抵長，並在此下車，約卸下兵員五六百名，砲廿門，汽車四十輛，戰車廿輛。又九日午後十二時，由寬城子開來重油車一列，內載兵員二百廿餘名，及來長春參加軍事會議之軍官廿三名。</p>
<p>〔合衆社重慶十日電〕中國軍事情報稱：共產軍在瀋陽東方有七萬人，南方有十萬人，而在瀋陽方面之國軍則僅有第二十五師與第五十二軍。但共產黨方面堅持共產軍並不計劃在潘陽區發動攻勢。</p>
<p>〔中央社長春九日電〕據某權威人士吿記者：近數日來，瀋哈長各地蘇軍，調動頻繁，截至目前爲正，任何方面均未接獲蘇方有關此事之任何通知。瀋陽蘇軍他調，該地我軍當局亦未接獲蘇方正式通知。蘇軍調動之眞意何在，仍無人能作確切之解答。據悉：瀋陽東大營之山嘴子發電所，及城北之北陵，已爲共軍佔領。此外，瀋市大體安靜。昨日來長之蘇軍，數量不詳，惟知在南郊偽軍官學校舊址。與我保安隊某團同住一處之蘇軍，計有坦克車廿三輛。卡車十一輛，官兵百餘人。其中　日語者，曾與我兵士交燄：據謂係自瀋陽開來。某權威人士又云：長春當地蘇軍，亦有調動之說。然據記者所見，目前尙無明顯跡象。近日來我方各機關所駐之蘇方連絡官，均稱病未工作，似在減少。中蘇雙方間之連絡工作，此與董彥平數度的晤蘇方要員，均無結果之情形同性質，現馬林諾夫斯基元帥，於十日十一日兩日內拒絕會客。</p>
<p>〔聯合社重慶十日電〕瀋陽蘇軍突然撤退，聯都中外人士，莫不極度關注，紛紛猜測蘇方此舉目的。樂觀人士認為蘇軍放棄瀋陽，乃完全退出東北之開端。悲觀者則謂，瀋陽蘇軍突然退出，存心作弄，中央政府或許不及趕派大軍進駐，防禦城郊共軍，且蘇軍仍可藉口保障對旅順之交通，隨時重返瀋陽。據另一部份人士意見，美英兩國公開責難蘇方在東北行動，或許為蘇當局決定從瀋腸撤兵之主因。</p>
<h3>董彥平飛錦　機損未成行</h3>
<p>〔中央社長春十日上午九時急常〕軍事代表團長董彥平，今午專機飛錦，向熊式輝報吿要公。據吿記者，一二日內即返長。董氏本日所乘之飛機，係由錦派來之專機。</p>
<p>〔中央社長春十日下午八時急電〕董彥平今又未成行，渠所乘專機，於起飛不久後，發覺油箱漏油，乃飛返。</p>
<p>〔中央社長春十日急電〕軍事代表團團長董彥平中將，於七日下午，與蘇軍參謀長特洛曾科中將，作第十三次之會談，前後歷三小時之久。昨對張莘夫案及大連港口問題，正式折衝外，董氏並曾提出合江及黑龍江省政之接收問題。董氏係因閱此間甫行復刊之長春新報，所載黑龍江已有所謂民選政府，並刊載省主席及各縣縣長姓名。同時，又刊載該省所謂人民自衛軍之力量及武力。董氏特以此詢問特派會科，謂合黑兩省，已於月前商得蘇方同意，由我方派員接收。當時蘇方曾謂該各省治安不靖，十數日內可肅淸。現該兩省主席，已滯留哈市月餘，仍不能前往接收。在此期間，黑省境已出現所謂民選政府，實與蘇方助我接收之原意相悖。特語特中將，加以解釋。特氏當時未予懇切答覆，當謂該兩省治安仍不靖，董氏詢以可吾由我方接收，特氏稱：蘇方目前無軍可派，請中國自行派軍前往可也。董氏謂：此項軍隊，如何前往？特稱：可由鐵路運輸，董當一笑置之。</p>
<h3>四川劃分三省　川東川西川南</h3>
<p>呈蔣主席核示中</p>
<p>〔本報重慶十日電〕中央設計局區域組黃國章，頃奉令擬就劃分四川省爲川東，川西，川南等三省，三省省會川東設南充，川西設成都，川南設瀘縣，此項計劃，已呈蔣主席核示中。</p>
<h3>張周馬完成視察　軍調部發表經過</h3>
<p>〔美國新聞處北平十八日電〕調處執行部頃發表第十八號公報，詳述張周馬此次完成視察華北華中經過，謂此種視察，將大爲增加該部工作之速度，並勗勉雙方將領捐除私見，國事爲重。公報中主要一段如下：</p>
<p>張家口目前並無主要之難題。在集寗方面，其主要困難，厥爲發動修復交通，但經此次視察後，調處執行部已開始採取適當之行動。</p>
<p>濟南乃魯省高級執行小組之主要基地，管轄其他五個執行及鐵路小組，在整個停戰區域中，該省形勢最爲嚴重，目前若干局部問題，已吿解決，但大體言之，該地帶仍極敏感。</p>
<p>在此方面，主要之問題有三：（一）停戰命令之進一步執行與解釋。（二）與第一項有關之被包圍部隊地位問題，即彼等是否應被視爲偽軍，此外，尙有重要城市解圍及食糧輸入問題。（三）立即恢復一切中斷之交通問題。</p>
<p>關於軍隊復員與整編，新訓令在發出中，預料可使第一項問題迎刃而解。同時委員會業已下令全國各被圍城鎭解圍，並准許食物自由輸入各城鎭，當地執行小組對於交通問題之解決，至爲樂觀。</p>
<p>在徐州一帶，雙方均擁有重兵。此方面之主要問題計有：（甲）恢復交通，並去除交通障碍，（乙）各城鎭解圍，（丙）棗莊煤礦局勢，（丁）隔離各部隊。關於煤礦復工問題之訓令，將於今日由調處執行部宣佈之，同時，各委員亦將對其部屬發施命令，料可採取迅速行動，應付其他上述問題。交通及城市解圍問題，亦爲新鄕執行小組所感覺憂慮。此方面之另一問題，則爲部隊之隔離，尤其是黃河孟縣方面之部隊。</p>
<p>張周兩大員在新鄕鄭重聲明，必須立即進行有關交通之工作，其他問題並無連帶關係，毌庸牽涉在內。對於此種觀點，馬歇爾將軍完全予以同意。</p>
<p>在太原方面，閻錫山主席認爲祇有兩種問題：（一）改善對立軍隊之聯絡，（二）實施調處執行部之指令。</p>
<p>關於上述兩問題，各單位均分別與其部下舉行會商，對於解決此種困難，已獲有顯著之進展。</p>
<p>三委員曾至歸綏，俾與綏主席及第十二戰區司令長官傳作義進行會談。</p>
<p>在延安逗留結果，已使三委員有機會與中共主席毛澤東及其他領袖會談，各領袖保證合作，極爲熱誠爽直。</p>
<p>過漢時，曾連同各長官對軍運及糧食缺乏問題採取行動。</p>
<h3>漢市司法人員　籲請提高待遇</h3>
<p>加薪工潮此起彼伏</p>
<p>〔本報漢口九日電〕因加薪運動而來之罷工潮，近仍此伏彼起，漢市中航及電訊員工雖已次第復工，而司法及一部行政員，昨又電呈層峯，籲請提高待遇，吾則即將總辭。</p>
<h3>蘇搬走東北物資　英照會表示反對</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦十日廣播稱：英國政府已正式經由英駐蘇大使館參贊羅勃芝，以照會送達蘇聯政府，對於蘇方搬走東北日工廠物資一點，表示反對。據稱：日本在滿洲之機器，必須視爲賠償之一部，而賠償之分配，應由盟國共同決定之。英方照會與美國牒文有一不同點，蓋英方未提及蘇軍留駐東北之事實也。</p>
<p>〔合衆社重慶十日電〕馬歇爾將軍刻正準備返美一行，昨夜在蔣主席之夏令別墅住宿。今日魏德邁將軍前往訪問，舉行會議。馬氏預定於今日與周恩來會晤。</p>
<h3>二中全會十三次大會　續檢討地方行政　何總司令報告受降經過</h3>
<p>〔中央社重慶十日電〕二中全會十日下午三時舉行第十三次大會，出席委員二百十八人，陳委員果夫主席，何總司令應欽作受降報吿歷一小時始畢，常即由胡委員庶華臨時動議，以全會名義，向最高統帥蔣委員長及全國將士致敬，經全體出席委員一致起立通過。嗣宣佈休息十分鐘，即開始對於地方行政報吿之檢討，多就地方行政效率低劣，喜任用私入，貪汚風氣熾盛，財政困難，及工作人員待遇菲薄等，加以檢討。發言委員有羅貢華·方靑儒·李培基·王星舟·彭昭賢·李文齋·胡秋原·程中行·聞亦有·鄧飛黃等，五時散會，明日上午九時舉行總理紀念週，隨舉行第十四次大會，下午審查，會晚上七時蔣總裁在軍委會禮堂招待全會委員晚宴。</p>
<p>〔聯合社重慶九日電〕二中全會今日繼續舉行會議，糧食部長徐堪報告稱：聯合國善後救濟總署運華物資，未達預定數額，國內糧食問題，甚形嚴重。美國駐華特使馬歇爾於遄返華府時，將與聯總負責人，討論接濟中國糧食問題。中國正謀獲得聯總允許，向越南，緬甸及暹邏等地採購米糧。聯總總幹事李曼近曾致電糧食部，籲請中國人民節食至最低限度，以待秋收。最令人憂慮者厥爲軍米問題，因軍米收買，價格較市價低二三倍。於日內報告聯合國大會經過。</p>
<p>〔中央社重慶十日電〕中權公祭故立法院副院長葉楚傖，故軍事委員會上將參議李例鈞，及故監察委員李夢庚，十日晨在陪都青年館舉行，到全體中央委員及國府各部會長官，由蔣主席主祭，領導行禮後，全體默哀致敬，於十時許禮成，歷時約一時卅分，今日上下午續往致祭者共千餘人。</p>
<h3>皇姑屯陳兵</h3>
<p>— 本報東北特派員　韓淸濤寄自溝幫子</p>
<p>在這全世界的眼睛，都注視着我國生命綫的東北的時候，東北的本身，已經是有些春意了。太陽照射著大地，溫暖，愉快。</p>
<p>但當老天變了臉，陰沉的低氣壓，掙扎般的小北風，撲頭蓋臉的打來，又够使人難堪。</p>
<p>大鼻子和小鼻子</p>
<p>東北人們的心情，目前也是忽陰忽晴般，一喜一憂的靜觀天氣的變化，創痛的心，不能再加以割裂！</p>
<p>東北的人民，過去給日人和俄人，都送了一個綽號，因爲他們都是我們貼身切膚的近鄰，遂在他們身上找了一個特證，鼻子是最惹人注意的，「小鼻子」和「大鼻子子」的兩個綽號的命運，就被決定了，大概那是日俄兩國在我領土東北作戰的時候。</p>
<p>跨迤東北的大門，就可以聽見人人在談「大鼻子」長和「大鼻子」短的故事。同時也可以聽到從潘陽來的人，在講「大鼻子」所搬演的現實，形形色色，洋洋大觀。</p>
<p>東北老百姓，對於打垮了「小鼻子　」，當然是興高采烈，歡欣若在。對於「大鼻子」的帮忙，常然也是衷心銘感，欣慰萬分。不過在這半年的長時間，還在眼前現實，又使大家起了懷疑，疑問着被解救出來的東北，是否還有問題。</p>
<p>蘇軍撤退問題</p>
<p>在大家高喊請求盟友蘇聯撤退東北駐軍的時候，東北的同胞，都感到了莫大的興奮和安慰。雖然據消息的傳來，這種請求和希望，目前很難成爲事實，但大家總覺得我們的盟友，不會令我們太失望的。</p>
<p>蘇聯紅軍在東北各交通綫上，駐有重兵，據傳內有兩個裝甲師團，和我國軍最接近的地方是瀋陽，紅軍在瀋陽市內，我軍在潘陽西郊不到十五里地方的皇姑屯，雙方的弟兄，偶而也有少數的碰面。</p>
<p>據傳大連方面，蘇軍近有增加，對于市民出入，限制很嚴。營口方面，蘇軍不多，約數似在二百左右，對于工事設備，都在擴充和加强。因爲這樣，有人認爲情勢惡劣，其實還須作冷靜的觀察，謀劃雙方友誼的增强，一切還要靠着人力勝天的。</p>
<p>八路軍</p>
<p>八路軍在東北的進軍和行動，人民已經有了深切的認識，同時還傳說着有「眞八路」「似八路」和「土八路」的分別。「南滿「」綫和北寧路綫中心區域的八路軍，據說係自山東龍口，乘木船至營口登陸的，番號是「遼東人民自衛軍」第一，二，三等支隊每支隊有三團，每團一千五百多人。</p>
<p>據調查，遼河沿岸現有共軍一萬人，遼寧附近有共軍二萬人瀋陽外圍，約有五六萬人，其他地區不詳。又據傳賀龍已于廿七日到海城指揮。營口共軍，日前曾利用查電表機會，淸查戶口。海城似有共軍集中，林彪在法庫和彰武一帶。</p>
<p>又傳長春鐵路綫以東區域，開原，鐵嶺，撫順，本溪等處附近，八路軍數頗多，似在控制礦區。瀋陽西北，彰武以北地區，另有僞蒙軍活動，騷擾。</p>
<p>北寧路綫政情</p>
<p>遼寧省的地形，在南端好像兩隻腿伸進了渤海，國軍所進駐的地方，僅僅是右邊的一隻腿，這隻腿就是遼寧省府目前所能控制的十幾縣，南起綏中，北至新民，裏面包括興城，錦縣，錦西，義縣，北鎭，黑山，遼中，合安，盤山等縣，另外還有兩三個不完整的縣份。</p>
<p>國軍目前已控制了整個的北寧路錢，和北寧路不完整的一二條支綫。火車來往，人很擁擠，多半是小本商販，因爲貨物缺乏，所以很困難。有些人來往營口溝帮子間，把營口的紙烟，運到北寧綫各地銷售。</p>
<p>在這些收復縣份裹，行政建樹，頗費氣力。經費困難，是一主因。同時法制章則，也有很多不便。一位縣府人員對記者說：「好多留下工作的僞滿縣府工作人員，對於現行公文及處理事務等繁複手續，大感不便，甚至對於用毛筆寫公文，也感到了困難。一般人民也有很多不便的感覺」。這需要多方設法，簡化一切行政上的手續，同時也需要有好多適應環境的揹施。又對於僞滿一些下級行政幹部，更要善加利用，他們會對於一般隔膜上，有很大幫助的。</p>
<p>不忍聞的流血</p>
<p>在全國同胞懇切呼籲不能再有自行殘殺和破壞建設的呼聲裏，東北境內的國共軍隊，近來仍有零星不幸事件發生。像二月廿七日夜裏，北寗路綫上的李家橋樑，遭到了破壞，一二個小車站也遭到了襲擊。所幸損壞情形不大，當日即行修復和安靜了。</p>
<p>二月裏的上旬和中旬，曾有幾次大流血，國共兩方，都有慘重的傷亡。據云最初營口之戰，國軍某軍一個營和兩個連，除了少數的被俘，大部份遭到了犧牲的悲慘命運，共軍傷亡也很大。</p>
<p>二月十六至廿日，在盤山東北的沙嶺地方，國共兩軍又有衝突。共軍在十六日的夜裏，開始攻擊沙嶺，戰事激烈一共是四天五夜，白天雙方都用砲轟，時間則作衝鋒戰。後來衝突停止了。國軍有相當的傷亡，共軍傷亡更慘重。據云裏面還夾雜着老百姓。營口和海城，都有大批的傷兵，此外還有其他的傳說，我眞不忍詳述了！（三月二日）</p>

<p>〔本報徐州十日電〕津浦北段自利國驊至　州之修復工程，昨晨開工數小時後，因共軍阻止，復吿停頓。聞共軍又提出幾個新要求：（一）路局須派負責人，與共軍商洽人事問題。（二）修路工人，經過河橋時，須經由共軍檢查。（三）收回民間鐵路器材，按共軍定價付款。交通小組刻又電呈北平調處執行部，請示解決辦法。</p>
<p>〔本報徐州十日電〕隴海東段修復工作，照交通小組規定，原擬昨（九）日開始，由於該地區共軍之拒絕，已成泡影。</p>
<p>〔中央社濟南九日電〕膠洲鐵路被破壞之二段地區，預計一個月左右，可恢復全綫通車，此爲濟南執行小組一行，赴張店交涉之重大收獲。津浦區鐵路局八日晨由濟開去之工程車一列，直駛張店，開始動工，材料方面，似無大困難，中共方面已允將藏於民間之鐵軌等物交出，中共控制下之各站，仍須由共方管理。又關於津浦路濟南以南被破壞之鐵路修復問題，泰安執行小組八日晨來濟，將與由平來此之鐵道小組會商後返泰。</p>
<h3>行動復員會議</h3>
<p>全會閉幕後在渝舉行</p>
<p>〔本報南京十日電〕重慶訊：勝利後首次全國行政復員會議，聞將於二中全會閉幕後，在渝舉行，由行政院長宋子文主持，因中委兼各省主席均已到渝，可能就近召集，以節省時間。此次會議如不邀各廳處長出席，將來還都後，仍須召集全國性擴大行政會議。惟此舉勢須於國民大會閉幕政府改組後實行。</p>
<h3>宋院長報告（二續）</h3>
<p>在增加收入方面，先須積極整理稅收，我們大家都明白，在一般社會上人人都希望政府於戰事終了之後，能减輕人民的負擔，但本席不能不直說經濟危機的嚴重性，不下於戰事的危機，政府爲求收支平衡，不能不求收入的增加，以期渡過當前的經濟危機，即使加重人民負擔，亦不得不忍耐一時。因爲人民的痛苦，莫甚於經濟的崩潰，政府要能使國民經濟，達到穩定，人民在過渡期內，自不能不有相當犧牲。如果政府能將經濟穩定，我們即使有點錯誤，人民可以原諒，反之，如果經濟趨於崩潰，即另有任何臨時的安慰，人民也不能滿意，現在必定要有克服當前困難的決心。</p>
<h3>整頓稅收之外處理敵偽產業</h3>
<p>在增加收入方面除了整頓稅收之外，另有一大宗臨時收入，就是敵僞產業的處理。現在社會上有許多人注意行政院處理敵僞產業的事情，並且也聽到各種的批評，我們一定都明白，敵人投降以後，政府所接收的敵僞產業，當然應該爲國家所有，這在任何國家都是一樣的，而且政府的經濟狀况，已經這樣困難，所以處理敵偽產業，也是目前最重要的工作，因爲收支平衡最重要的途徑，是縮减軍費，但在縮編期內，仍須有一個過渡抵補的辦法，這就是處理敵僞產業的收入。這種產業，雖然不能一天都變成現款，但於相當時期內，善爲處理，在彌補國庫收入，不無小補。</p>

<h3>解救收復區糧荒　將採取四項對策　糧食農林兩部將予合併</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十日電〕重慶訊，當局於聽取來渝出席二中全會之收復區各省主席，報吿湘·鄂·粵·桂·皖·贛·江·浙各地一般糧荒情况，及各地因兵災匪禍而造成之農業衰敗嚴重危機，至表殷憂。將採取下列對策，（一）部份停止以官價收購軍糧，俟接收遣俘復員完成後，全面停止。（二）由政府採購大宗洋米，以應軍秣，兼顧民食。（三）厲行糧食增產運動，並列爲考成。（四）調整產米區與缺糧區之交通，以濟盈虛。聞糧食部與農林部將合併，同時有人主張將糧部併入財部，但爲適應當前局勢，糧部工作亦須持續至政府改組後，再予合併。　〔本報南京十日電〕鎭江訊，趕修蘇北歸江壩暨以大宗農貸拯救蘇北已吿破產之農村，實不容稍緩。旅鎭蘇北人士，於讀本報時，獲悉中委薛篤弼爲呼籲速興水利，曾言及善後救濟總署，將於短期內結束，均表憂憤，已紛函毛澤東，速令蘇北共軍，勿妨害蘇北水利工程之進行，如不能利用善救總署之物資，以救蘇北垂危之農村，一日蘇北變成澤國，不僅禍及江南，即蘇魯邊區共軍，認爲豐美之紅色糧倉，亦將成爲泡影矣。</p>

<h3>社論　評米食貸款</h3>
<p>抗戰以來，工商界希望獲得鉅額貸款的事件很多。其中有屬於積極性的，如購辦機械，採辦原料等，也有屬於消極性的，如解除危機，維持生產等。我們常常聽到某種貸款，其數字達數十億之鉅，可見國家銀行對於這類任務，也算克盡厥職。</p>
<p>不過以我們所聞，却也還有許多未能盡滿人意的地方。第一，手續太麻煩，致未能迅赴事機，第二，條件太苛刻，事實上不易辦到。例如擔保品這一項，要金條，要房地產，都使貸款人無法接受。假如他們有金條，難道自己不會變賣？假如有房地產，其他的銀行，也未嘗不可以承受。須知他們所以要向國家銀行請求帮助，正因爲沒有這一類担保品之故。又須知他們所以不向一般商業銀行通融，也正因爲情形特殊，與一般資金的周轉不同之故。國家銀行承受這一類貸款，與其說是爲營利起見，母寗謂爲扶助生產，救濟工商，來得恰當些。所以在確保資金的安全以外，很應當體卹商艱，替他們寬籌出路，方是正辦。</p>
<p>但是工商界方面，也並不是沒有可以議論之處。復員以後，當局爲充裕物資起見，曾經提倡過集團採購，替他們介紹借款，這也算是體卹商艱之一道。以筆者所聞，有某業開出一篇總帳來，採辦若干，成本若千，乃至運費等等若干，竟完全要着落在這一筆借款上。好像他們一點流動資金也沒有，這也未免太不成話了。我們知道：商舖有大小，資本有厚薄，自然未可一概而論。但是商人總是將本求利，何至赤手空拳，一文不名？</p>
<p>昨日聽到米糧貸款的辦法，要米商商認一半，由國家銀行承貸一半。就是說：米商如肯出資二十億，那末，銀行也照借二十億，我們認爲這是最公允，最合理的條件，似乎雙方都應該接受。因爲如此辦理，一則銀行可以放心，二則力量更見充實，三則官官商合作，可以澈底實現。所以米糧貸款，固可以如此辦，其他茶葉貸欵，繭業貸款等，也未嘗不可以如此辦，我們認爲這是一個很好的榜樣。</p>
<p>至於其他的條件，在一方面，固然要求本息的安全，而在另一方面，總要顧到對方事實上的困難，大家應本着互信互諒的精神，來克服當前產業界的危機。至於一切手續，尤其要顧到時問上的因素，例如採辦茶葉，趕快該準備了。倘使儘管磋商，討論，遷延，周折，致蹉跎了適宜的時令，那末，於扶助工商，流通資金這個大目標，總覺得有些美中不足。上文說過：這一類貸款，帶點積極的性質，和通常商業放款不同。我們希望工商界應努力扳作，不可存着完全倚賴的心理，同時也希望當局大處落墨，不可完全以生意眼爲標準。</p>

<h3>天津路中山旅館命案　旅客被殺　先發制人、抱不平肇禍　兇手向警分局自首</h3>
<p>（本報訊）天津路四八〇號中山旅館，六日上午來一軍人，身穿草綠色軍裝，關室二樓五十五號，填名王餘才，當晚狎一妓女陳金寶，二十六歲，揚州人。盤柦數日，情好逾恒。七日王率領兩軍人至甯波路五一一號業廢花生意之楊蓮生家，以搜查軍火為名，闖入內室，任意搜抄，結果一無所獲。旋見孿生之姊正在吸食鴉片，遂藉口這犯禁例，大肆恐嚇，勒索二十萬元，卒以四萬五千元了字，携款而去。</p>
<p>翌晚楊有友人蔡文錦（在某合作社為科員）至楊寓晚膳，蓮生乃舉實相告。蔡以軍人不應敲詐人民，嗣後再來，由本人設法拘捕。楊聆斯語以為得一保障，殊為興奮。証至昨日午後三時，王等三人復往楊寓索詐不遂，悻悻而去。當由揚派人尾隨於後，暼見彼輩跨入中山旅社上樓，即週歸用電話通知文錦。未幾蔡來，　至中山旅館賬房間詢問，未查明其住於何號房間，方步出大門時，適王由外返，由楊指認無訛，跟隨進館上樓，至扶梯中間，田蔡上前招呼，語未竟，詎王即探裝作摸槍摸樣。蔡為先發制人計，立出所備手槍，發槍一響，適中王右腰，翻身倒地。斯時蔡見已肇禍，親至老　分局自首，並報告經過。由司法股主任蔣上佩率股員陳鈞幹·張魁棟會同憲軍警巡查隊前往調查，一而將傷人送仁濟醫院，未幾身死。當檢獲死者衣袋中一手槍，內有子彈三粒，法幣三萬餘元及婦女小照數幀。旋又將妓女陳金實帶局偵訊。經調查結果，死者符號上實名王興才。兇犯後經移送巡查隊核辦。</p>

<h3>投機氣氛瀰漫中　一週市場概況　黃金領先紗米挺進</h3>
<p>上週金融又起波浪，焓赤領先，股債外幣，各見生色，其他綿紗米糧日用品等，一致激挺，貪米曾出三萬元關外，週末回至二萬九千元，升斗小民，無不叫苦，中行雖連續配售黃金，無如粥少僧多，商人仍藉口抬價，投機牟利，輕而易舉，馴致游資咸集中各種商品市場進攻，不願尋求正常出路，同時一般正當工商業則苦於流動資本太少無法經營，此種矛盾現象，若不早為之所，工商業前途固屬危險，國民經濟亦將日見窮　，茲將一週動態略述如下。</p>
<p>烚赤　週一外匯開始掛牌，人心堅昂，初由一五八萬元叩近一六〇萬元，終以美匯掛出在二〇二〇元，　售有人，價會回小至一四五萬元，週二週三形成盤局，嗣因期匯掛高，引起猜測，週四猛跳至一七五萬元，週五中行配售一百四十條照一六五折價，漲風稍定，週六又照一七〇價格配售，市況因之益挺，最高曾做到一七八萬云。</p>
<p>外幣　美鈔週初高見二〇八〇元，嗣外匯開出為二〇二〇元，價乃回小，週四以黃金昂騰，由一九九〇元高至二一八〇元，惟中行匯率未動，略為穩定，後因貿易商吸收現鈔，市價愈盤愈高，週六收盤為二一五〇，港票本週又因游資活動，新貨繼續挺秀，老貨平穩。</p>
<p>統債　週初因銀根緊，一致疲跌，週四北幫吸收，始見回漲，週五金融界又吸收，價續上升，週六丙丁戊稍升，甲乙種平。</p>
<p>華股　週初迫銀根者，吐售頗多，各股下游，永紗跌至二五〇〇元，美亞退進二千關內，週三金市外幣起伏微細，游資轉向，在銀行及北幫吸勢下，驟起漲風，永安紗廠由二六五〇元升至三二五〇元，美亞一八〇〇元升至二四〇〇元，週四謠傳將設臨時市場，銀根又鬆，買戶踵接，紗廠再升至三四五〇元，美亞二六〇〇元，景福更呈空前高價一六〇元，週五略形疲懈，週六又見秀色，永紗已高至三七〇〇矣。外股初因銀根緊縮，多呈萎疲，週三套買風起，價乃上展，直至週五始呈盤檔，週六一致下瀉。</p>
<p>現紗　在上週間，初甚平庸，入後因黃金曁股票騰踊，兼以客幫實銷不惡，一部份紗商心思猶在　高，新賣戶不多，場上頗有求過於供之勢，是以情勢漸趨高翔，全週以星期五之六十支日光二百八十五萬為最高，星期一之十支火竺五十萬為最低，若以支數言，則四十二支藍凰漲十八萬為最巨，二十支特雙馬漲十六萬十六支光明漲十五萬，此外各紗扯漲七八萬。</p>
<p>布市　因客銷欠暢，紡建公司開售甚巨，調　籌碼充裕，故漲勢甚微，以桃花女士林及如意漂布各漲四五千為多，其餘各牌約漲二三千元。</p>
<p>花市　交易尚暢，紡建公司採辦於先，民營紗廠及花商等相繼於後，市勢較紗布情況尤為緊俏，據業中人云，現下花價尚廉，較之紗價高低相差懸殊，紗廠買花紡紗，獲利甚鉅，尤以細紗獲利獨甚，故買氣頗濃，各花比上週六扯漲五六千元不等。</p>
<p>其他　至於其他各物，漲多平少，週五食糧興起　烈漲風以後，各貨均受影響，日用品中尤以火柴為最，燃料黑市猖獗，市價相　盤高，白煤塊已升至每噸六六萬元云。</p>
<h3>星洲限制僑匯　華僑急盼修正</h3>
<p>（中央社新加坡九日專電）此間僑胞對英當局規定自三月十八日起生效之新僑匯法規，深表失望。俱認為月限匯四十五元，殊屬過低，每一家庭之匯款人不能超過一人，此一規定，使華僑更陷入困難地位，蓋此問每一家庭中之眷屬本身，亦有家庭在中國，而此在華之家庭，於匯款新法規實施時，仍須自彼等，獲取經濟援助。華僑各界刻正考慮我駐新加坡總領事請求當局修正新法規事。</p>

<p>專論</p>
<h3>增進茶產芻議</h3>
<p>— 朱衍慶</p>
<p>經濟建設，首在增加生產，增加生產之範圍極廣，有從工業上着手者，有從農業上致力者，吾國地大物博，農產富庶，近雖高唱工業化，而工業原料，仍不能不取諸農產品，我國農產品，向以絲茶桐油等為對外貿易之大宗，而尤以茶為國內外日用所必需，故先言茶。</p>
<p>國茶特點甚多，為英美法蘇諸國人士所酷嗜，祇以國人習故蹈常，鮮加研究，國際市場又頻遭「排外」「傾銷」等人為的障礙，致出口茶銷，屢起屢仆，現在國際貿易上的障礙，逐漸消除，在此時機，但得政府為這振導，商民自身振作，則國茶之銷路，當不難漸復舊觀，。</p>
<p>茶之產區，滇蜀二省，雖經政府提倡，其量尚微，其餘浙閩湘皖贛等茶產索　之區，又大半遭遇兵襲，產量大為減色，自由區亦以交通梗阻，外銷停頓，存茶山積，　變居多，是以業此者類皆焦頭爛額，不能自振，現值經濟建設之秋，工農·貸款，政府一再舉辦，本市洋莊茶業公會，亦曾以書面向四聯總處申請貸款，准由公會推派代表，經與中國·農民兩銀行洽商，其方法及數量，刻雖尚在談判之中，我人頗希望其早見於事實之迅速。</p>
<p>除貸款外，尚有數點，亦非官民合作不為功，（一）茶農茶工，在獲得貸款以後，即當竭力改良，諸如栽培·採摘·焙製·包裝等，均應配合於外銷，絕不許粗製濫造，自私自利，致損海外之信用，（二）茶商並當勤求國外市場之情報，以為產銷之準繩，（三）匯兌方面，大別之尚有二點，值得注意，（一）匯往內地應用者，（二）外銷茶款之結匯我國法幣者，銀行方面，如能將匯費，儘量減低，並將結匯，儘量放寬，則增採購與推銷，自必交受其利，（四）運輸方面，自產區以達上海，交通未盡暢通，各路轉運尚多阻滯，應由政府通令水陸運輸各機構，如浙贛·滬杭·滬甯等鐵路，九江甯波等輪船，以及公路汽車，供給運輸工具，儘量予以便利，使茶葉早一日到滬，即可早一日出口，（五）倉儲方面，茶之本質，既不宜潮濕，又不宜與其他鹹腥之貨同儲，以免熏染味變，現在各地屋荒，不但在產區至上海一帶，中途極少適宜之堆棧，即上海倉庫，亦多香臭排陳，久失整理，此有待於多方面之配合，以便堆存，（六）對外貿易之衰落，其原因甚多，而外交上缺乏援助，亦其一也，或遭禁止入口，或受重稅抑價，此為過去所習聞，而日茶尤為華茶之勁敵，今幸日茶勢力，遠不如前，應由政府通令駐外各領館及商務參贊隨時考察，供給消息，各國如有故意抑勒妨礙等舉動，並應竭力折衝，減少其當前之困難，即所以增加其競爭之力量。</p>
<p>以上各點，義或未盡，然欲促進茶產，推廣茶銷，竊謂非從以上諸點，分道並進，未易奏效也</p>
<h3>棉布商遭嚇詐　金鐲一雙不夠　東方飯店中幹警化裝擒匪</h3>
<p>（本報訊）棉布商趙冠雲，家住西藏南路文元坊十六號。昨晨七時忽來衣制服者三人，自稱是憲兵，指趙有漢奸嫌疑，勒索現鈔一百萬元了結。趙以無此鉅額法幣，乃婉商以金鐲兩只替代。該三人即懷鐲離去。下午又忽來電，云金鐲價值不足一百萬，須再携款至東方飯店二一六號補交，趙即報告泰山分局，由司法股長張柔率領幹警四人化裝前往，將匪黨全部捕獲，並抄出手槍一支，帶局查究。</p>
<h3>福利基金會成立</h3>
<p>中國福利基金委員會，已由宋慶齡氏主持之下，宣告成立，會址勘定蘇州路一七五號二〇一號室。該會為國際性之拯救貧民救濟機關，現已得英國駐華大使薛穆爵士夫人贊助，募得大宗欵項，並將於蘭心大戲院公演「萬里長城」話劇，以為募欵之舉。</p>
<h3>戰前公債　所謂「另訂辦法」　用意原來如此</h3>
<p>三十年以前發行各債，自從財政當局宣佈另訂辦法以後，上海證券市場頓起猜測，或謂政府將以關金償付，或謂將以孫票償還，最起碼的觀察，則謂政府或將顧念商民戰時忠於債票的熱忱，將給予相當優待，言者紛紜，聞者動色，於是公債市價，由百而千，由一千而二千，此搶彼奪，對此僅有的籌碼，無不視為奇貨，最近二中全會中，潘委員公展對財政當局提出質問，據財政部長八日答覆，所謂另訂辦法，係因戰前各債，多半流入淪陷區，戰事期中，或遭敵偽刦掠，必須查明刦失情形，辦理登記手續，始能恢復償付，至於孫票兌付本息，根本全係謠傳云云，（詳情參閱日本報專電）投機家一場迷夢，至此當可清醒矣。</p>

<h3>思想，計劃，實行</h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>在讀書界裏，想的工作是非常重要的，有幾個哲學家曾經設過：「不要祗是讀，要想。」意思就是單是讀，並不能產生什麼效果，唯有從事思考，方始能够獲得益處。其實這個想的工作，正可以運用到事業的管理方面。</p>
<p>受過敎育的人，都能够了解一種意思（Idea）和事實（Fact）的關係，想到一種意思之後！一定還要想到它的旁邊和背後的一切。有許多錯誤的事實，都是因爲一念之錯所造成的，所以在決定之前，一定要仔細的想。</p>
<p>要造成思考的力量，讀書是必要的工作，對於讀書方面，有一句至理名言，是値得採用的，即就是「不要讀好的書，要讀最好的書。」因爲一個人的時問有一限，不能讀盡所有的書，因此選擇那些最好的書，實在是唯一的辦法。許多偉大的書，偉大的人物，偉大的問題和偉大的主義，都是思想的結晶。</p>
<p>在事業的管理方面，「一個良好的開始，就是工作的一半的完成，」是非常確切的。所以思想，計劃，實行，可以說是處決每一種事務的必經步驟。</p>
<h3>染織業應行改善之管見</h3>
<p>— 大康</p>
<p>染織業自於民國卅二年被敵僞强制收買以還，元氣大傷，嗣後祗得以製造棉蔴紗或人造絲絹絲交織品代替，藉以這避統制，廠方本身旣可苟延殘喘，職工亦一能維持生計，勿致捲入停閉，及失業之漩渦，然敵偽時期，苛捐雜稅，層層加迫，益見山窮水盡之窘勢。但染織業猶冀含辛茹苦，忍受壓力，勉度難關，等得光明來臨，以舒積　。今抗戰勝利，河山重光，宗遂夙願，且在政府勵行復員之際，復得經濟部規定對於工廠生產用電儘量供給，俾八年來所受創傷而資復蘇，唯感於染織業以往目光均欠遠大，只圖目前，致荆棘叢生，造成同業間隔閡重重之弊，而促使敵僞伺隙可乘，實行强制收買，當頭棒擊，將染織界數十年來慘淡經營之基業，予以摧毀無遺，寗非痛哉。爰就管見所及，應行改善者分述於後：</p>
<p>（一）營業競爭：過往染織業會員廠商，其能具備染織機械經營自染自織者，爲數不多，唯以自購白坏染色或代客染色布匹或織造各色布匹之數種，而偏重其一者，故中小型染織廠佔爲多數，所營業務，大率相似，麕集一門，肇成同業競爭，以業務競爭而萌妒忌，實則應有推讓之風，若處處欲攫爲獨占，此種托辣斯政策，必致碰壁失敗，此應改善者一。</p>
<p>（二）職工待遇：抗戰期間，以薪水階級所增比例而言，最爲落後，較之生活指數所漲倍數，誠有霄壞之別，職工因物價之激盪，負擔日重，鰓鰓顧慮，影響不寗於工作，故職工待遇，應儘量提高，足敷仰事俯畜，使其無內顧之憂，不再爲開門七件事而操心，間接予廠方之益無形提升也，是應改善者二。</p>
<p>（三）勞工福利：吾國勞工之待遇，比之歐美各國，不啻小巫見大巫，彼方能享受三八主義，即八小時工作，八小時敎育，八小時睡眠，工作效率提高，而迥視吾國勞工日以繼夜所得工資旣未得養家活口。而精神物質上所受痛苦，罄竹難書故亦須仿照前例爲勞工謀一定休息之時問，再加以學識之灌輸，糾正其思想又可避免外界煽動而起反動罷工之妄舉，豈非廠方及勞工兩受其利哉，此應改善者。</p>

<p>— 費文</p>
<p>中國的菜肴，向以鮮美著名，因爲中國菜與外國菜根本上的不同，就是中國菜是已經完成調味工作的，外國菜是在吃的時候，方始做調味的工作的。因此中國的家庭主婦，對於調味品的應用，是非常注意的。</p>
<p>過去日本的味之素盤踞在中國市塲，吸取了中國大量的余錢，後來中國人自己生產的調味品雖則逐漸增加，但是味之素仍舊在中國市場銷行。</p>
<p>然而今後的局面將完全不同，中國和南洋的市塲，將完全是中國國產調味品的市塲，因此祗要在過去打下一點基礎，具備相當聲譽的調味品製造廠，就可以大量發展，前途未可限量。</p>
<p>在七年前創設標準味粉廠的時候，正當八一三抗戰時期，用意所在就是戰事終有一天停止，要埋頭苦幹，博得社會的好評，就不難在戰後謀有發展；即使在戰爭時期，把全部資產，完全犧牲，祗要能够獲得商譽，依舊是非常値得的。因此當味粉原料斷絕，不能繼續生產的時候就發行鮮大王醬油，貢獻給全市家庭。</p>
<p>現在戰爭結束，正當走上建設大道。但放在面前的，並不是一條坦路，而是一條荊棘滿地的道路；目前一般工廠，都缺少人力和財力，因此第一步非要把人力和財力解決不可。財力方面，希望有志實業，並關心國計民生的社會人士，從事投資。這種投資，未必能獲得出乎意料的暴利，但如果在工廠發達，民生安定的一個大循環之下，可以獲得的利益，正是不難想像的。在人力方面，那末每一個股東，除了投資之外，更可以貢獻他們的力量。本來股份有限公司組織的最大優點，就在於人才集中，可以從事合作，在這個建設重於一切的時代，股份有限公司，更應該發揮組織上的力量，這一點，更希望投資於各股份有限公司的股東一，加以深切的考慮。</p>
<h3>努力建設的墨西哥</h3>
<p>— Michael　Scully原作　徐百益譯</p>
<p>足資我國工業界借鏡</p>
<p>墨西哥是一個落後的國家，但近年以來，努力改進，銳意整頓，已和從前大不相同，因此當一個旅行家到達墨西哥城去旅行，如果希望要看到像從前一樣的那種閒散而浪漫的情緒，他一定要大大地失望。在外表上，我們依舊司以看到那些十八世紀的建築物，和充滿着古色古香的墨西哥性格的情調，但在同一個時候，我們更容易迅速地感覺到交通的繁忙，到處可以看到採用鋼窗的建築物，道路也比較從前大爲寬闊，正像一九二〇年的第得律城一般。人口方面，也有迅速的增加，在一九三〇年，該城的人口不到一百萬人，目前已經將近二百萬人了。</p>
<p>一個初到墨西哥城的旅行家，可以看到許多複雜錯綜的生活狀况，有些人能够購買每件七塊錢的襯衫，二十塊錢的帽子和五十塊錢一套的衣服，但也有許多人住在簡陋的屋子裏，有房屋糾紛，有黑市和其他罪惡，同時他也可以聽到缺少勞工的呼聲，一所偉大醫院的興建和一個大水閘的將近完工。</p>
<p>墨西哥早就要走上工業化的路，當一九一〇年的時候，正要開始走上工業化的路，突然發生了革命，躭誤了十年功夫。接着就是世界的不景氣，所以眞正的進步，是在一九三〇年方纔開始的。最大的推動力是由卡第拉總統產生的，他把許多人的金錢，强迫地投資到工廠，建設事業方面去。他在全國鐵道、油業、和其他事業完全國家化起來，由偉大的國家組織來管理經營。因此就有許多人得住在墨西哥城，需要家庭衣服，食物和其他一切東西的供應。但是因爲他沒有顧到許多農夫們葉農就工的結果，因此曾經爲勞工過剩，失業人數的加增而感到棘手。</p>
<p>常第二次世界大戰開始的時候，墨西哥不得不開始製造那些向來由國外進口的東西，爲了鼓勵生產起見，自從一九四一年起，政府把新設的工廠轄免五年的捐稅，和進口稅，這樣就造成了一個復興的最大的機會。美國的炎本，爲了逃避在本國的高額賦稅，大量的流入墨西哥，本來由墨西哥向國外流去的資本，重新流回本國來，美國的大量採購，更增多了投資的數字。他們又把在墨西哥週圍的田地，建設工廠，國家方面，又投資一千萬美金，建設煉鋼廠，煉油廠，發電廠和水利工程，在一九四四年民族資本的總共投資額是三千二百萬元，到了一九四五年，增加到六千萬元，在一九四五年的九月中，有一個最大的企業組識，資本總額一千五百萬元，就是惟是頂好電氣廠，由美國和墨西哥兩國的銀行家等共同投資，購買了一百六十畝的田地，鄰近墨西哥城，預備製造無綫電，電氣氷箱，電熨斗，洗衣機，和其他許多電氣用品，資本的分配是墨西哥佔百分之五十一，美國佔百分之四十九。</p>
<p>由於這種設施，國外人士對於墨西哥產生，更多的信任，各種當地的工業，也日益增多。在一九三一年墨西哥整個電影事業，祗產生了兩部業餘性質的影片，在一九四四年，墨西哥的攝影場中製成了八十三部電影，總共利益七千六百萬元，成爲國家收入的第三位，同時，出版事業，也較十年前，增加了六倍，銀器製造業，紡織業和其他出品的產量，達到了前所沒有夢想到的數目。</p>
<p>常然墨西哥也仍舊有他們自己的困難問題，因爲有三萬五千萬元的過剩通貨就形成了通貨膨脹的狀態，地產的代價漲上了十倍，其他東西也繼續增長，即使日用品，也較一九四〇年增漲了二倍半。</p>
<p>不過，墨西哥的前途是可以樂觀的，因爲有下列幾點原因：</p>
<p>（一）政府方面，有充分的財力，可以使它的理想，成爲事實，並且將繼續採取與外資合作的方、式。自從一九四〇年以來，政府方面，對於農民，也和勞工一樣地顧到，使他們據有農田。</p>
<p>（二）墨西哥的工業，已走上電氣化的路，因爲墨西哥所產的煤頓量很少，因此就利用油質等發電，在墨西哥城中，已有建立兩個很大的發電廠。水利方面的工程，也在積極進行之中。</p>
<p>（三）墨西哥政府，深知今後的發展，非先使交通便利不可，因此對於鐵道和道路工作，也在積極進行。</p>
<p>（四）爲了吸收新智識特派技術人才到美國去學習，他們自己也逐漸能改造就許多工程師和科學家。</p>

<h3>Confusing Soviet Troop Movements: Shenyang in Chaos, Communist Troops Active, Dongdaying and Beiling Both Occupied</h3>
<p>[Our Chongqing Dispatch, 10th] Amidst worsening news from the Northeast, many Central Committee members within the military hold differing opinions regarding military arrangements in the Northeast, generally advocating for strengthened military personnel. It is said that during the Second Plenary Session, a proposal was made to reassign Chen Cheng to the Northeast. It is reported that Chen himself has no objections to this, and the highest authorities may consider this suggestion.</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch] London, 10th (broadcast): After the Soviet withdrawal from Shenyang, Central Government troops have clashed with Communist troops.</p>
<p>[Our Changchun Dispatch, 9th] From yesterday afternoon to the present, many Soviet military vehicles have traveled from north of Shenyang. The train station has reopened, and passenger trains have resumed service. Communist troops are very active in the northeast and south of the city, attempting to take advantage of the situation. Communist troops from Tieling, Tongyuan, and other places have been marching south at an accelerated pace in recent days, with most having reached the Ertaizi area north of Shenyang. However, our troops are very confident and determined not to easily abandon their defenses. In the past three days, many buildings in the urban area have been vacated, and the municipal government has dispatched police to guard them at all times. The Miaotuo Railway Bridge south of the city was taken over by our troops yesterday. This is our military's only takeover activity since the Soviet troops began their withdrawal. The Beiling Police Station was attacked by bandits last night and was eventually driven out. Although there is a general sense of confusion regarding the actions of the Soviet troops, there is no doubt that they have begun to leave this area.</p>
<p>[Our Changchun Dispatch, 9th] Amidst reports of Soviet troop movements in Shenyang, many Soviet soldiers have been seen continuously on the streets here from 9:00 AM this morning until evening, seemingly new arrivals from elsewhere. Among them are occasional artillery vehicles and tanks. However, it is currently impossible to confirm whether these Soviet troops are from Shenyang. According to reports, only the northern part of Shenyang still has Soviet troops.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Changchun, 10th] From 1:00 PM on the 9th to 9:00 AM on the 10th, a total of six military trains fully loaded with Soviet soldiers and military supplies arrived in Changchun from Shenyang, disembarking approximately 500-600 soldiers, 20 artillery pieces, 40 automobiles, and 20 tanks. Furthermore, at 12:00 PM on the 9th, a train of heavy oil cars arrived from Kuanchengzi, carrying over 220 soldiers and 23 military officers who were to attend a military conference in Changchun.</p>
<p>[United Press, Chongqing, 10th] Chinese military intelligence reports that there are 70,000 Communist troops east of Shenyang and 100,000 south of Shenyang, while the National Army in the Shenyang area consists only of the 25th Division and the 52nd Army. However, the Communist Party insists that the Communist forces do not plan to launch an offensive in the Shenyang area.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Changchun, 9th] According to an authoritative source who spoke to reporters, in recent days, Soviet troops in Shenyang, Harbin, and Changchun have been frequently mobilized. As of now, no notification has been received from the Soviet side regarding this matter. The military authorities in Shenyang have also not received formal notification from the Soviet side regarding the redeployment of Soviet troops there. The true meaning of the Soviet troop movements remains unclear to everyone. It is reported that the Shanzuizi Power Plant in Dongdaying, Shenyang, and Beiling north of the city have been occupied by Communist troops. Aside from that, Shenyang is generally calm. The number of Soviet troops arriving in Changchun yesterday is unknown, but they are located at the former site of the puppet military officer school in the southern suburbs. The Soviet troops, co-located with a regiment of our security forces, include 23 tanks, 11 trucks, and over 100 officers and soldiers. One of them, speaking in Japanese, told our soldiers that they had come from Shenyang. The authoritative source also said that there are rumors of Soviet troop movements in Changchun as well. However, according to what reporters have seen, there are no obvious signs of this at present. In recent days, the Soviet liaison officers stationed at our various agencies have claimed to be ill and have not been working, which seems to be a reduction in contact. The failure of communication between the Chinese and Soviet sides is similar to the unsuccessful meetings between Dong Yanping and key Soviet figures. Marshal Malinovsky has refused to meet guests on both the 10th and 11th.</p>
<p>[United Press, Chongqing, 10th] The sudden withdrawal of Soviet troops from Shenyang has drawn intense attention from people both within and outside the United Nations, who are speculating about the purpose of this move by the Soviet side. Optimists believe that the Soviet abandonment of Shenyang is the beginning of a complete withdrawal from the Northeast. Pessimists say that the sudden withdrawal of Soviet troops from Shenyang is deliberately mischievous, and the central government may not be able to send a large army in time to defend against the Communist troops in the suburbs. Furthermore, the Soviet troops could still use the pretext of ensuring transportation to Lushun and return to Shenyang at any time. According to another group of people, the public condemnation by the United States and Britain of Soviet actions in the Northeast may be the main reason for the Soviet authorities' decision to withdraw troops from Shenyang and Changchun.</p>
<h3>Dong Yanping's Flight to Jinzhou Fails Due to Aircraft Damage</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Changchun, 10th, 9:00 AM Urgent] Military Delegation Head Dong Yanping was to fly to Jinzhou by special plane this afternoon to report important matters to Xiong Shihui. According to reporters, he will return to Changchun in a day or two. The plane Dong was to take was a special plane sent from Jinzhou.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Changchun, 10th, 8:00 PM Urgent] Dong Yanping did not make the trip again today. The special plane he was riding in developed a fuel leak shortly after takeoff and flew back.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Changchun, 10th, Urgent] Lieutenant General Dong Yanping, head of the military delegation, held his 13th meeting with Soviet Chief of Staff Lieutenant General Trotsenko on the afternoon of the 7th, lasting three hours. Yesterday, in addition to formally negotiating the Zhang Xinfu case and the Dalian port issue, Dong also raised the issue of taking over the administration of the provinces of Hujiang and Heilongjiang. Dong did so because he read the newly re-published Changchun Xinbao (Changchun New Report) newspaper, which reported that Heilongjiang had a so-called "democratically elected government" and published the names of the provincial chairman and county magistrates. At the same time, it also published information on the strength and weaponry of the province's so-called "People's Self-Defense Army." Dong specifically inquired about this with Special Envoy Trotsenko, saying that an agreement had been reached with the Soviet side to send personnel to take over Hujiang and Heilongjiang provinces months ago. At that time, the Soviet side stated that the provinces were not secure, but that order could be restored within ten days. Now, the chairmen of the two provinces have been stranded in Harbin for over a month and are still unable to proceed with the takeover. During this period, a so-called "democratically elected government" has emerged in Heilongjiang province, which is contrary to the original intention of the Soviet side to assist us in the takeover. Dong asked Trotsenko to explain. Trotsenko did not give a frank reply at the time, saying that the two provinces were still not secure. Dong asked if it was possible for us to take over, and Trotsenko said: The Soviet side currently has no troops to spare, please send Chinese troops there yourself. Dong said: How can these troops get there? Trotsenko replied: They can be transported by rail. Dong simply laughed it off.</p>
<h3>Sichuan Divided into Three Provinces: Eastern Sichuan, Western Sichuan, and Southern Sichuan</h3>
<p>Submitted to Chairman Chiang for Approval</p>
<p>[Our Chongqing Dispatch, 10th] Huang Guozhang of the Regional Division of the Central Planning Bureau recently received orders to draft a plan to divide Sichuan Province into three provinces: Eastern Sichuan, Western Sichuan, and Southern Sichuan. The capitals of the three provinces would be Nanchong for Eastern Sichuan, Chengdu for Western Sichuan, and Luzhou County for Southern Sichuan. This plan has been submitted to Chairman Chiang for approval.</p>
<h3>Zhang, Zhou, and Marshall Complete Inspection: Military Mediation Department Issues Report on Progress</h3>
<p>[U.S. Information Service, Beiping, 18th] The Mediation Executive Headquarters recently issued Public Notice No. 18, detailing the completed inspection of North and Central China by Zhang, Zhou, and Marshall, stating that this type of inspection will greatly increase the speed of the department's work and urging both sides' generals to set aside personal opinions and prioritize national affairs. The main section of the public notice is as follows:</p>
<p>There are currently no major problems in Zhangjiakou. In Jining, the main difficulty is initiating the restoration of transportation, but after this inspection, the Mediation Executive Headquarters has begun to take appropriate action.</p>
<p>Jinan is the main base of the Shandong Provincial Executive Group, which manages five other executive and railway groups. The situation in this province is the most serious in the entire ceasefire area. Some local problems have now been resolved, but in general, the area remains extremely sensitive.</p>
<p>In this regard, there are three main problems: (1) further implementation and interpretation of the ceasefire order; (2) the status of besieged troops related to the first item, i.e., whether they should be regarded as puppet troops, in addition to the lifting of the siege of important cities and the import of food; (3) immediate restoration of all interrupted transportation.</p>
<p>Regarding troop demobilization and reorganization, new instructions are being issued and are expected to resolve the first problem. At the same time, the committee has ordered the lifting of the siege of all besieged towns and cities nationwide and has allowed the free import of food into each city and town. The local executive group is very optimistic about solving the transportation problem.</p>
<p>In the Xuzhou area, both sides have heavy troops. The main problems in this area include: (a) restoring transportation and removing transportation obstacles, (b) lifting the siege of each town and city, (c) the situation at the Zaozhuang Coal Mine, (d) separating the troops. Instructions regarding the resumption of work at the coal mine will be announced today by the Mediation Executive Headquarters. At the same time, each committee member will issue orders to his subordinates, which will allow for rapid action to address the other aforementioned problems. The transportation and city de-encirclement issues are also of concern to the Xinxiang Executive Group. Another problem in this area is the separation of troops, especially the troops on the Meng County section of the Yellow River.</p>
<p>Zhang and Zhou solemnly declared in Xinxiang that work on transportation must be carried out immediately, and that other issues are not related and should not be involved. General Marshall fully agreed with this view.</p>
<p>In Taiyuan, Chairman Yan Xishan believes that there are only two problems: (1) improving communication between opposing troops, and (2) implementing the instructions of the Mediation Executive Headquarters.</p>
<p>Regarding the above two problems, each unit has held consultations with its subordinates separately, and significant progress has been made in resolving these difficulties.</p>
<p>The three committee members went to Guihua to hold talks with Sui Chairman and Commander-in-Chief of the Twelfth War Zone Fu Zuoyi.</p>
<p>As a result of their stay in Yan'an, the three committee members had the opportunity to meet with Communist Party Chairman Mao Zedong and other leaders. The leaders' guarantees of cooperation were extremely sincere and straightforward.</p>
<p>When passing through Wuhan, action was taken regarding military transportation and food shortages in conjunction with the local officials.</p>
<h3>Judiciary Personnel in Wuhan Appeal for Higher Pay</h3>
<p>Salary Increase Strikes Rise and Fall</p>
<p>[Our Hankou Dispatch, 9th] Due to the salary increase movement, the wave of strikes has recently risen and fallen repeatedly. Although the employees of China Aviation and Telecommunications in Wuhan have gradually resumed work, judicial and some administrative personnel yesterday telegraphed to higher authorities, appealing for higher pay and threatening to resign en masse.</p>
<h3>Britain Protests Soviet Removal of Resources from the Northeast with a Note</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] London, 10th (broadcast): The British government has formally sent a note via Robert Chi, counselor of the British Embassy in the Soviet Union, to the Soviet government, expressing its opposition to the Soviet side's removal of resources from Japanese factories in the Northeast. It is claimed that the machinery in Manchuria belonging to the Japanese must be regarded as part of the reparations, and the distribution of the reparations should be jointly decided by the Allied countries. The British note differs from the American one in that the British note does not mention the fact that Soviet troops are stationed in the Northeast.</p>
<p>[United Press, Chongqing, 10th] General Marshall is currently preparing for a trip back to the United States and stayed overnight at Chairman Chiang's summer villa last night. Today, General Wedemeyer visited and held a meeting. Marshall is scheduled to meet with Zhou Enlai today.</p>
<h3>The Second Plenary Session's Thirteenth General Meeting Continues to Review Local Administration; Commander-in-Chief He Reports on the Surrender Process</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 10th] The Second Plenary Session held its thirteenth general meeting at 3:00 PM on the 10th, with 218 committee members in attendance. Committee Member Chen Guofu presided. Commander-in-Chief He Yingqin gave a surrender report, which lasted an hour. Committee Member Hu Shuhua then made a temporary motion in the name of the entire meeting to pay tribute to Supreme Commander Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and all national soldiers. All the committee members in attendance unanimously stood up and passed the motion. After a ten-minute recess was announced, the review of the local administration report began. Many committee members focused their remarks on the low efficiency of local administration, the prevalence of nepotism, rampant corruption, financial difficulties, and the meager salaries of staff. The committee members who spoke included Luo Gonghua, Fang Qingru, Li Peiji, Wang Xingzhou, Peng Zhaoxian, Li Wenzhai, Hu Qiuyuan, Cheng Zhonghang, Wen Yiyou, and Deng Feihuang. The meeting adjourned at 5:00 PM. The memorial service to Dr. Sun Yat-sen will be held at 9:00 AM tomorrow, followed by the fourteenth general meeting. The review meeting will be held in the afternoon. Chiang Kai-shek hosted a dinner banquet for the plenary committee members at 7:00 PM in the auditorium of the Military Council.</p>
<p>[United Press, Chongqing, 9th] The Second Plenary Session continued to meet today. Food Minister Xu Kan reported that the supplies shipped to China by the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) have not reached the projected amount, and the domestic food problem is very serious. U.S. Special Envoy to China Marshall will discuss the issue of providing food to China with UNRRA officials when he returns to Washington. China is seeking UNRRA's permission to purchase rice from Vietnam, Burma, and Siam. UNRRA Director General Lehman recently sent a telegram to the Ministry of Food, urging the Chinese people to reduce their food consumption to the lowest possible level to await the autumn harvest. The most worrisome issue is military rice, because the purchase price of military rice is two or three times lower than the market price. He will report on the proceedings of the United Nations General Assembly in the coming days.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 10th] A public memorial service for the late Vice President of the Legislative Yuan Ye Chucang, the late General Advisor of the Military Council Li Liejun, and the late Supervisory Committee Member Li Menggeng was held at the Youth Hall in the capital on the 10th. All members of the Central Committee and the heads of various ministries and commissions of the National Government attended. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek presided over the ceremony, and after leading the attendees in paying their respects, everyone observed a moment of silence. The ceremony concluded at around 10:00 AM, lasting approximately 1 hour and 30 minutes. Over a thousand people continued to pay their respects throughout the day.</p>
<h3>Troops Massed at Huanggu Village</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent Han Qingtao from Goubangzi</p>
<p>At a time when the eyes of the whole world are focused on the Northeast, which is the lifeline of our country, the Northeast itself already has a hint of spring. The sun shines on the earth, warm and pleasant.</p>
<p>But when the sky changes its face, the gloomy low pressure and the struggling little northerly wind slap you in the face, which is quite embarrassing.</p>
<p>Big Noses and Little Noses</p>
<p>The people of the Northeast are also in a fluctuating mood, observing the weather with a mixture of joy and sorrow. The trauma must not be torn open again!</p>
<p>In the past, the people of the Northeast gave nicknames to both the Japanese and the Russians, because they are our close and intimate neighbors. So, we looked for a special feature on them, and the nose was the most noticeable. The fate of the two nicknames "Little Nose" and "Big Nose" was thus decided, probably during the Russo-Japanese War in our territory of the Northeast.</p>
<p>As you step into the gate of the Northeast, you can hear everyone talking about the stories of "Big Nose" long and "Big Nose" short. At the same time, you can also hear people from Shenyang talking about the reality being played out by "Big Nose", in all shapes and colors, a magnificent sight.</p>
<p>Of course, the people of the Northeast were elated and overjoyed at the defeat of the "Little Noses." Of course, they were also sincerely grateful and gratified for the help of the "Big Noses." However, after such a long period of half a year, the reality in front of them has made everyone suspicious, wondering if there are still problems in the Northeast that has been liberated.</p>
<p>The Question of Soviet Troop Withdrawal</p>
<p>When everyone shouted and requested that our ally, the Soviet Union, withdraw its troops stationed in the Northeast, the compatriots in the Northeast felt immense excitement and comfort. Although according to the news, this request and hope is currently difficult to become a reality, everyone always feels that our allies will not let us down too much.</p>
<p>The Soviet Red Army has heavily armed troops stationed on the transportation lines in the Northeast. It is said that there are two armored divisions among them. The closest place to our army is Shenyang. The Red Army is in Shenyang City, and our army is in Huanggu Village, less than fifteen miles from the western suburbs of Shenyang. Occasionally, a small number of brothers from both sides meet.</p>
<p>It is reported that the Soviet troops in Dalian have recently increased, and restrictions on citizens entering and leaving are very strict. There are not many Soviet troops in Yingkou, about two hundred, and construction equipment is being expanded and strengthened. Because of this, some people think the situation is bad, but in fact, we still need to observe calmly and plan to enhance the friendship between the two sides. Everything still depends on human effort overcoming nature.</p>
<p>The Eighth Route Army</p>
<p>The people have a deep understanding of the advance and actions of the Eighth Route Army in the Northeast. At the same time, there are also rumors about the differences between "Real Eighth Route," "Similar Eighth Route," and "Local Eighth Route." The Eighth Route Army in the central areas of the "Southern Manchuria" line and the Beining Railway line are said to have landed in Yingkou from Longkou, Shandong, by wooden boat. The unit number is the First, Second, and Third detachments of the "Liaodong People's Self-Defense Army", each detachment having three regiments, with each regiment having more than one thousand five hundred people.</p>
<p>According to investigations, there are currently 10,000 Communist troops along the Liao River, 20,000 Communist troops near Liaoning, and approximately 50,000 to 60,000 Communist troops on the outskirts of Shenyang. Other areas are unknown. It is also reported that He Long arrived in Haicheng on the 27th to command. Communist troops in Yingkou recently used the opportunity to check electricity meters to check household registrations. There seems to be a concentration of Communist troops in Haicheng, and Lin Biao is in the Faku and Zhangwu areas.</p>
<p>It is also reported that there are a large number of Eighth Route Army troops in the area east of the Changchun Railway line and near Kaiyuan, Tieling, Fushun, Benxi, and other places, seemingly controlling the mining areas. Northwest of Shenyang, north of Zhangwu, there are other puppet Mongolian troops active, harassing the area.</p>
<p>Political Situation on the Beining Railway Line</p>
<p>The terrain of Liaoning Province looks like two legs stretching into the Bohai Sea at the southern end. The areas where the National Army is stationed are only one leg on the right. This leg is the dozen or so counties that the Liaoning Provincial Government can currently control, from Suizhong in the south to Xinmin in the north, including Xingcheng, Jin County, Jinxi, Yi County, Beizhen, Heishan, Liaozhong, He'an, Panjin, and other counties. There are also two or three incomplete counties.</p>
<p>The National Army currently controls the entire Beining Railway line and one or two incomplete branch lines of the Beining Railway. Trains are crowded, mostly with small traders, because there is a shortage of goods, so it is very difficult. Some people travel back and forth between Yingkou and Goubangzi, transporting Yingkou cigarettes to various places on the Beining line for sale.</p>
<p>In these recovered counties, administrative construction requires a lot of effort. Financial difficulties are a major cause. At the same time, there are many inconveniences in the legal system and regulations. A county government official told reporters: "Many of the puppet Manchu county government staff who stayed behind find the current complex procedures for official documents and handling affairs very inconvenient, and even find it difficult to write official documents with a brush. The general public also has many inconveniences." This requires finding ways to simplify all administrative procedures, and also requires many measures to adapt to the environment. In addition, lower-level administrative cadres of the puppet Manchu regime should be used well, as they will be of great help in bridging the general gap.</p>
<p>Unbearable Bloodshed</p>
<p>Amidst the sincere calls from compatriots across the country not to kill each other and destroy construction, there have recently been sporadic and unfortunate incidents between the National and Communist armies in the Northeast. For example, on the night of February 27, the Lijiaqiao Bridge on the Beining Railway line was destroyed, and one or two small stations were attacked. Fortunately, the damage was not significant, and it was repaired and quieted on the same day.</p>
<p>In the early and middle parts of February, there were several major bloodshed incidents, and both the National and Communist sides suffered heavy casualties. It is said that in the initial battle of Yingkou, one battalion and two companies of a certain army of the National Army, except for a few who were captured, mostly suffered the tragic fate of being sacrificed. The Communist troops also suffered heavy casualties.</p>
<p>From February 16 to 20, there was another conflict between the National and Communist armies in the Shaling area northeast of Panjin. The Communist troops began attacking Shaling on the night of the 16th, and the battle was fierce for a total of four days and five nights. During the day, both sides used artillery shelling, and at night they launched assault attacks. The conflict later stopped. The National Army suffered considerable casualties, and the Communist troops suffered even heavier casualties. It is said that civilians were also involved. There were large numbers of wounded soldiers in Yingkou and Haicheng, and there were other rumors, which I really cannot bear to describe in detail! (March 2)</p>

<p>The restoration project of the northern section of the Jinpu Railway, from Liguo Hua to 　Zhou, was halted again yesterday morning after only a few hours of work due to obstruction by the Communist army. It is reported that the Communist army has put forward several new demands: (1) The Railway Bureau must send a responsible person to discuss personnel issues with the Communist army. (2) Repair workers must be inspected by the Communist army when passing river bridges. (3) Railway materials recovered from civilians must be paid for at prices set by the Communist army. The transportation team has now telegraphed the Beiping Mediation Executive Headquarters for instructions on how to resolve the situation.</p>

<p>The restoration work on the eastern section of the Longhai Railway, which was originally scheduled to start yesterday (the 9th) according to the regulations of the transportation team, has failed due to the refusal of the Communist army in that area.</p>

<p>膠洲鐵路被破壞之二段地區，預計一個月左右，可恢復全綫通車，此爲濟南執行小組一行，赴張店交涉之重大收獲。津浦區鐵路局八日晨由濟開去之工程車一列，直駛張店，開始動工，材料方面，似無大困難，中共方面已允將藏於民間之鐵軌等物交出，中共控制下之各站，仍須由共方管理。又關於津浦路濟南以南被破壞之鐵路修復問題，泰安執行小組八日晨來濟，將與由平來此之鐵道小組會商後返泰。</p>
<p>It is estimated that the two sections of the Jiaozhou Railway that were damaged can be restored to full operation in about a month. This is a major achievement of the Jinan Executive Team's trip to Zhangdian for negotiations. A train of engineering vehicles dispatched by the Jinpu Railway Bureau from Ji'nan on the morning of the 8th drove directly to Zhangdian and began work. There seems to be no major difficulty in terms of materials. The Chinese Communist side has agreed to hand over the rails and other materials hidden among the people. The stations under the control of the Chinese Communist Party will still be managed by the Communist side. Regarding the restoration of the damaged railway south of Jinan on the Jinpu Railway, the Tai'an Executive Team came to Jinan on the morning of the 8th and will return to Tai'an after discussing with the Railway Team from Beiping.</p>
<h3>行動復員會議</h3>
<h3>Action Restoration Conference</h3>
<p>全會閉幕後在渝舉行</p>
<p>To be Held in Chongqing After the Closing of the Plenary Session</p>
<p>〔本報南京十日電〕</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 10th Dispatch]</p>
<p>重慶訊：勝利後首次全國行政復員會議，聞將於二中全會閉幕後，在渝舉行，由行政院長宋子文主持，因中委兼各省主席均已到渝，可能就近召集，以節省時間。此次會議如不邀各廳處長出席，將來還都後，仍須召集全國性擴大行政會議。惟此舉勢須於國民大會閉幕政府改組後實行。</p>
<p>Chongqing News: It is reported that the first National Administrative Restoration Conference after the victory will be held in Chongqing after the closing of the Second Plenary Session of the Kuomintang Sixth Central Committee, presided over by Premier Song Ziwen. Because the Central Committee members who are also provincial chairmen have all arrived in Chongqing, it is possible to convene the meeting nearby to save time. If this meeting does not invite the heads of various departments and divisions to attend, it will still be necessary to convene a national expanded administrative conference after the capital is moved back. However, this move must be implemented after the closing of the National Assembly and the reorganization of the government.</p>
<h3>宋院長報告（二續）</h3>
<h3>Premier Song's Report (Continued, Part 2)</h3>
<p>在增加收入方面，先須積極整理稅收，我們大家都明白，在一般社會上人人都希望政府於戰事終了之後，能减輕人民的負擔，但本席不能不直說經濟危機的嚴重性，不下於戰事的危機，政府爲求收支平衡，不能不求收入的增加，以期渡過當前的經濟危機，即使加重人民負擔，亦不得不忍耐一時。因爲人民的痛苦，莫甚於經濟的崩潰，政府要能使國民經濟，達到穩定，人民在過渡期內，自不能不有相當犧牲。如果政府能將經濟穩定，我們即使有點錯誤，人民可以原諒，反之，如果經濟趨於崩潰，即另有任何臨時的安慰，人民也不能滿意，現在必定要有克服當前困難的決心。</p>
<p>In terms of increasing revenue, we must first actively reorganize taxation. We all understand that in general society, everyone hopes that the government can reduce the burden on the people after the end of the war. However, I must frankly say that the severity of the economic crisis is no less than the crisis of war. In order to achieve a balance of payments, the government cannot but seek to increase revenue in order to overcome the current economic crisis. Even if it increases the burden on the people, it must be endured for a while. Because the suffering of the people is no greater than the collapse of the economy. If the government can stabilize the national economy, the people can forgive us even if we make some mistakes. Conversely, if the economy collapses, no temporary comfort can satisfy the people. We must now have the determination to overcome the current difficulties.</p>
<h3>整頓稅收之外處理敵偽產業</h3>
<h3>Handling Enemy and Puppet Assets in Addition to Reorganizing Taxation</h3>
<p>在增加收入方面除了整頓稅收之外，另有一大宗臨時收入，就是敵僞產業的處理。現在社會上有許多人注意行政院處理敵僞產業的事情，並且也聽到各種的批評，我們一定都明白，敵人投降以後，政府所接收的敵僞產業，當然應該爲國家所有，這在任何國家都是一樣的，而且政府的經濟狀况，已經這樣困難，所以處理敵偽產業，也是目前最重要的工作，因爲收支平衡最重要的途徑，是縮减軍費，但在縮編期內，仍須有一個過渡抵補的辦法，這就是處理敵僞產業的收入。這種產業，雖然不能一天都變成現款，但於相當時期內，善爲處理，在彌補國庫收入，不無小補。</p>
<p>In addition to reorganizing taxation in terms of increasing revenue, there is another large temporary income, which is the handling of enemy and puppet assets. Many people in society are now paying attention to the Executive Yuan's handling of enemy and puppet assets, and have also heard various criticisms. We must all understand that after the enemy surrenders, the enemy and puppet assets received by the government should of course belong to the state. This is the same in any country, and the government's economic situation is already so difficult, so handling enemy and puppet assets is currently the most important task. Because the most important way to balance income and expenditure is to reduce military spending, but during the downsizing period, there must still be a transitional compensation method, which is the income from handling enemy and puppet assets. Although these assets cannot all be converted into cash in one day, properly handling them within a considerable period of time will help to make up for the treasury revenue.</p>

<p>Chongqing News: The authorities, after listening to the reports from the provincial chairmen of the recovered areas who came to Chongqing to attend the Second Plenary Session of the Kuomintang Sixth Central Committee, on the general food shortage in Hunan, Hubei, Guangdong, Guangxi, Anhui, Jiangxi, Jiangsu, and Zhejiang provinces, and the severe crisis of agricultural decline caused by war and banditry in various places, expressed deep concern. The following countermeasures will be adopted: (1) Partially stop purchasing military grain at official prices, and completely stop after the completion of reception, repatriation, and demobilization. (2) The government will purchase large quantities of foreign rice to meet military needs and take into account civilian food. (3) Vigorously promote the grain production increase campaign and list it as a performance assessment item. (4) Adjust transportation between rice-producing areas and grain-deficient areas to balance surpluses and deficits. It is reported that the Ministry of Food and the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry will be merged. At the same time, some people advocate merging the Ministry of Food into the Ministry of Finance, but in order to adapt to the current situation, the work of the Ministry of Food must also continue until after the government is reorganized before merging again.</p>

<p>Zhenjiang News: Rushing to repair the Guijiang Dam in northern Jiangsu and using large agricultural loans to save the bankrupt villages in northern Jiangsu cannot be delayed. People from northern Jiangsu living in Zhenjiang learned when reading this newspaper that Central Committee member Xue Dubi, in order to appeal for the rapid development of water conservancy, mentioned that the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration would end in the short term. They all expressed concern and anger, and have sent letters to Mao Zedong, urging him to order the Communist army in northern Jiangsu not to hinder the progress of water conservancy projects in northern Jiangsu. If the materials of the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration cannot be used to save the endangered villages in northern Jiangsu, if northern Jiangsu becomes a swamp one day, it will not only harm Jiangnan, but also the Communist army in the border area of Jiangsu and Shandong, which regards it as a fertile red granary, will also become an illusion.</p>

<h3>國際大局疑雲密佈　三強正謀總解決　三國首長大有再度會議可能　頭痛醫頭政策徒足增添紛爭</h3>
<h3>The International Situation is Clouded with Doubt; the Three Powers are Seeking a Comprehensive Solution; The Leaders of the Three Countries are Highly Likely to Meet Again; A Policy of Treating the Head When it Hurts Only Adds to the Disputes</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓十日電〕</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 10th Dispatch]</p>
<p>國際大局，疑雲密佈，氣氛極爲惡劣。美，英，蘇三國首長大有再度會議可能，以圖一勞永逸，對各項問題，求取總解決。華府外交界認爲日前所取政策，不啻頭痛　頭，脚痛醫脚，從足增添紛爭。美，英，蘇再度會商，問題似在何方發動，召開會議，杜魯門總統週五曾表示三强會議，非不可能，但應在華盛頓舉行。目下已起爭執者，有義大利，伊朗，土耳其，中國之東九省，與保加利亞數地，足使三强會議，煞費討論。</p>
<p>The international situation is clouded with doubt, and the atmosphere is extremely bad. There is a high possibility that the leaders of the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union will meet again in an attempt to solve all problems once and for all. Washington diplomatic circles believe that the policies taken recently are like treating the head when it hurts and the foot when it hurts, which only adds to the disputes. The question of where to initiate and convene the meeting for the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union to consult again seems to be the issue. President Truman stated on Friday that a three-power conference is not impossible, but it should be held in Washington. Currently, the disputes that have arisen include Italy, Iran, Turkey, the nine eastern provinces of China, and several places in Bulgaria, which are enough to make the three-power conference a difficult discussion.</p>

<p>中央社河內電訊：法軍于萬已於八日夜在海防登陸，準備自十六日起接防越南北部，惟法方尚不知接防將展期至十六日，以爲即可接收。法軍登陸前，先曾與越南當局成立預備協定，守軍乃奉命停止攻擊法艦，今越南北部情形已復平靜狀態。</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Hanoi Dispatch: 10,000 French troops landed in Haiphong on the night of the 8th, preparing to take over the defense of northern Vietnam from the 16th. However, the French side was not aware that the handover would be extended to the 16th and thought they could take over immediately. Before the French troops landed, they had established a preliminary agreement with the Vietnamese authorities, and the defending troops were ordered to stop attacking the French warships. The situation in northern Vietnam has now returned to a calm state.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Hanoi, 10th Special Dispatch]</p>
<p>越南政府頃頒佈命令，禁止一切集會遊行，並嚴格管制報章雜誌言論，以免破壞法越協定與中法軍隊之交防工作。登陸海防之法軍逾一萬五千人，已超過法越協定所規定之數目。河內方面留居於大兵營內之法軍五千人仍未裝配，以若干交防之小節目尚未商定，與法越停止衝突命令尚未普遍傳達，恐發生意外，但一般相信十六日交防，必可順利實行。</p>
<p>The Vietnamese government has recently issued an order prohibiting all gatherings and demonstrations, and strictly controlling the speech of newspapers and magazines, in order to avoid disrupting the Franco-Vietnamese agreement and the handover work of the Chinese and French troops. More than 15,000 French troops have landed in Haiphong, exceeding the number stipulated in the Franco-Vietnamese agreement. The 5,000 French troops stationed in the large barracks in Hanoi have not yet been equipped, because some small details of the handover have not yet been agreed upon, and the order to cease conflict between France and Vietnam has not been widely disseminated. There is fear of accidents, but it is generally believed that the handover on the 16th will be carried out smoothly.</p>

<p>英前首相邱吉爾昨向美陸海軍官發表演說稱：英美兩國於情勢需要之時，必能團結一致，以增强兩國政府所決定之聯合行動。確信我人之切實團結，爲我人所共有之寳貴財產，但在我人此生，不信再有需要此種聯合努力之情勢云</p>
<p>Former British Prime Minister Churchill gave a speech to American army and navy officers yesterday, saying: Britain and the United States will definitely unite when the situation requires, in order to strengthen the joint actions decided by the governments of the two countries.

<p>Senator Taylor declared yesterday: "Churchill's speech urging a British-American alliance is almost tantamount to declaring war on the Soviet Union.

The conclusion of the subcommittee generally supports Hawaii becoming a state and can be decided as soon as the report of the House Territories Committee is awaited. President Truman urged Congress in his message that year to "fulfill the wishes of the people of Hawaii as soon as possible and make the territory a state." House Territories Representative Farrington has introduced a bill to enable the people of Hawaii to establish a constitution and state government in order to join the American Federation and stand on an equal footing with other states.</p>

<p>The International Monetary Conference held its opening ceremony in front of the flags of 43 countries today. U.S. Secretary of the Treasury Vinson served as chairman and first gave a speech, pointing out to the directors of the International Bank and Fund Group with a capital of 188 billion U.S. dollars that if they want to rebuild a sound world economic structure, they must race against time to stay clear-headed, otherwise we may have the next, or "last," war. Subsequently, British representative Keynes and representatives from China, France, Mexico, and other countries successively spoke, all urging the delegates to expedite the establishment of the two lending institutions in order to promote world trade and facilitate international exchange. A short telegram from President Truman was also read at the meeting, stating that "establishing a sound economic structure is a top priority.

<h3>Ministry of Education Utilizes Scenic Xuanwu Lake to Implement Social Education; Educational Film Studio Moves from Chongqing to Beijing</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch] To promote electrical education, the Ministry of Education established the China Educational Film Studio in Wenquan, Northern Chongqing. Since then, it has produced 48 educational films, with two copies of each. One copy is kept at the studio, and the other is submitted to the Ministry of Education for screening purposes. The Ministry of Education considers the Five Continents Park in Xuanwu Lake, a famous scenic spot in Nanjing, to be a suitable location for implementing social education due to its large number of visitors during the spring and autumn seasons. During the enemy-puppet regime, a film studio was attached to the park. After the central government recovered it, the film studio moved to Shanghai. Currently, an affiliated agency of the Mausoleum Administration Office is working in the park.

<h3>Editorial: On Rice Loan</h3>
<p>Since the War of Resistance, many industrial and commercial enterprises have hoped to obtain large loans. Some of these loans are for proactive purposes, such as purchasing machinery or raw materials, while others are for defensive purposes, such as resolving crises or maintaining production. We often hear of certain loans amounting to billions of yuan, indicating that national banks are fulfilling their duties in this regard.</p>
<p>However, according to what we have heard, there are still many areas that fail to fully satisfy people's expectations. First, the procedures are too cumbersome, preventing timely action. Second, the conditions are too harsh and difficult to meet in practice. For example, the collateral requirement, such as gold bars or real estate, is unacceptable to borrowers. If they had gold bars, wouldn't they sell them themselves? If they had real estate, couldn't other banks accept it? It should be understood that they are seeking assistance from national banks precisely because they lack such collateral. It should also be understood that they are not seeking accommodation from ordinary commercial banks precisely because their situation is unique and different from ordinary capital turnover. National banks undertaking such loans should be seen as supporting production and rescuing industry and commerce, rather than simply seeking profit. Therefore, in addition to ensuring the safety of funds, they should also sympathize with the difficulties of businesses and help them find a way out. This is the proper approach.</p>
<p>However, there are also points of discussion on the part of the industrial and commercial sectors. After the recovery, in order to replenish supplies, the authorities promoted group purchasing and introduced them to loans. This can also be considered a way of sympathizing with the difficulties of businesses. According to what I have heard, some businesses present a general account, stating the amount of purchases, the cost, and the freight, all of which must be covered by the loan. It seems as if they have no working capital at all, which is simply unacceptable. We know that businesses vary in size and capital, and it is impossible to generalize. However, merchants always seek profit from capital, so how could they be completely empty-handed and penniless?</p>
<p>Yesterday, I heard about the rice loan program, which requires rice merchants to recognize half of the amount, with the national bank lending the other half. That is, if rice merchants are willing to invest 2 billion yuan, then the bank will also lend 2 billion yuan. We believe that this is the fairest and most reasonable condition, and both parties should accept it. Because if it is handled in this way, first, the bank can rest assured; second, the strength will be more substantial; and third, official-merchant cooperation can be thoroughly realized. Therefore, rice loans can be handled in this way, and tea loans, silk loans, and other loans can also be handled in this way. We believe that this is a very good example.</p>
<p>As for the other conditions, on the one hand, it is necessary to ensure the safety of the principal and interest, and on the other hand, it is necessary to consider the actual difficulties of the other party. Everyone should overcome the current crisis in the industry in a spirit of mutual trust and mutual understanding. As for all the procedures, especially the time factor must be considered. For example, the preparation for purchasing tea should be done quickly. If we keep consulting, discussing, delaying, and complicating things, and miss the appropriate season, then the grand goal of supporting industry and commerce and circulating funds will always feel somewhat imperfect. As mentioned above, this type of loan has a proactive nature and is different from ordinary commercial loans. We hope that industry and commerce will work hard and not have a completely dependent mentality. At the same time, we also hope that the authorities will focus on the big picture and not use business standards as the sole criterion.</p>

<h3>A Tragedy Amidst Labor Unrest: Two Workers Shot Dead in Front of the Zhabu Road City Guard Team Headquarters</h3>
<p>(Our Dispatch) Recently, a wave of labor unrest has occurred among carpenters and joiners in this city due to wage issues. Yesterday afternoon at 4 PM, hundreds of carpenters and joiners passed by the Victory Theater on Zhabu Road, Hongkou, and went to the First Squadron of the First Battalion of the City Guard Team to demand the release of two arrested workers. A dispute arose, and the team members fired three shots to suppress the crowd, hitting two workers in the head on the spot. The bullets pierced the back of their heads, causing severe injuries, and they fell to the ground. One of them died immediately.

<h3>Murder Case at Zhongshan Hotel on Tianjin Road: Traveler Killed; Preemptive Strike and Standing Up for Injustice Cause Trouble; Murderer Surrenders to Police Precinct</h3>
<p>(Our Dispatch) A soldier, wearing a grass-green uniform, checked into room 55 on the second floor of the Zhongshan Hotel at No. 480 Tianjin Road on the morning of the 6th. He registered under the name Wang Yucai. That night, he consorted with a prostitute named Chen Jinbao, 26 years old, from Yangzhou. They spent several days together, and their relationship became increasingly close. On the 7th, Wang led two soldiers to the home of Yang Liansheng, who ran an opium den business at No. 511 Ningbo Road. Under the pretext of searching for military weapons, they broke into the inner room and searched arbitrarily, but found nothing. They then saw Yang's twin sister smoking opium and, using this as an excuse, threatened her extensively and extorted 200,000 yuan, eventually settling for 45,000 yuan, which they took away.</p>
<p>The following evening, Cai Wenjin (a staff member at a cooperative) visited Yang at his residence for dinner. Liansheng told him the truth about what had happened. Cai believed that soldiers should not extort from the people and said that if they came again, he would find a way to arrest them. Yang was excited by this assurance, thinking he had found a protector. Around 3 PM yesterday afternoon, Wang and the other two returned to Yang's residence to extort money again but were unsuccessful and left angrily. Yang sent someone to follow them and saw them enter the Zhongshan Hotel and go upstairs. He immediately returned home and notified Wenjin by telephone. Shortly afterwards, Cai arrived, went to the front desk of the Zhongshan Hotel to inquire, but could not determine which room they were staying in. As he was walking out the door, Wang happened to return from outside. Yang identified him without error. Cai followed him into the hotel and upstairs. In the middle of the staircase, Cai stepped forward to greet him, but before he could finish speaking, Wang pretended to reach for a gun. Cai, in order to preemptively strike, immediately pulled out the pistol he had prepared and fired a shot, hitting Wang in the right waist. He fell to the ground. At this time, Cai, realizing that he had caused trouble, went to the Old City Police Precinct to surrender and reported what had happened. Jiang Shangpei, the director of the judicial section, led section members Chen Junqian and Zhang Kuidong, along with the military police patrol team, to investigate. They immediately sent the injured man to Renji Hospital, but he died shortly afterwards. A pistol with three bullets, more than 30,000 yuan in legal tender, and several small photos of women were found in the deceased's pocket. The prostitute Chen Jinshi was also brought to the precinct for questioning. After investigation, it was determined that the deceased's real name was Wang Xingcai. The suspect was later transferred to the patrol team for processing.</p>

The price of rice once exceeded 30,000 yuan, but returned to 29,000 yuan by the weekend, causing hardship for ordinary people. Although the Central Bank continuously allocated gold, it was like too many monks and too little gruel. Merchants continued to raise prices on pretexts, making speculative profits easily. As a result, speculative funds concentrated on attacking various commodity markets, unwilling to seek normal outlets. At the same time, legitimate industrial and commercial enterprises suffered from too little working capital and were unable to operate. If this contradictory phenomenon is not resolved early, the future of industrial and commercial enterprises will be dangerous, and the national economy will become increasingly impoverished. The week's trends are briefly described below.</p>
<p>"Han Chi" On Monday, the foreign exchange began trading, and people were firmly bullish. Initially, it approached 1.6 million yuan from 1.58 million yuan. Eventually, the US exchange rate was quoted at 2,020 yuan, and there were sellers, so the price returned to 1.45 million yuan. A stalemate formed on Tuesday and Wednesday. Subsequently, as the term exchange rate rose, speculation was triggered. On Thursday, it jumped to 1.75 million yuan. On Friday, the Central Bank allocated 140 taels at a discounted price of 1.65 million, and the surge slowed down slightly. On Saturday, it was allocated again at a price of 1.7 million, and the market situation rose even more. The highest price was 1.78 million yuan.</p>
<p>Foreign Currency The US dollar initially reached 2,080 yuan, but as the foreign exchange opened at 2,020 yuan, the price returned slightly. On Thursday, due to the rise of gold, it rose from 1,990 yuan to 2,180 yuan. However, the Central Bank's exchange rate did not move, stabilizing slightly. Later, as traders absorbed cash, the market price rose higher and higher. The closing price on Saturday was 2,150. Hong Kong dollars continued to be strong this week due to the activity of speculative funds, with new currency rising and old currency stable.</p>
<p>Unified Bonds At the beginning of the week, they were uniformly sluggish due to tight money. On Thursday, buying from the Northern Gang saw a rebound. On Friday, the financial community absorbed more, and the price continued to rise. On Saturday, types C, D, and E rose slightly, while types A and B were flat.</p>
<p>Chinese Stocks At the beginning of the week, there was a lot of selling by those facing tight money. Various stocks fell, with Yong Yarn falling to 2,500 yuan and Meiya retreating within 2,000. On Wednesday, as the gold and foreign exchange market fluctuated slightly, speculative funds turned to stocks. Under the buying pressure from banks and the Northern Gang, a sudden surge occurred. Yong An Spinning Mill rose from 2,650 yuan to 3,250 yuan, Meiya from 1,800 yuan to 2,400 yuan, and Jingfu reached an unprecedented high price of 160 yuan. On Thursday, rumors spread that a temporary market would be set up, and money became looser, with buyers following one another. The yarn mill rose again to 3,450 yuan, Meiya 2,600 yuan, and Jingfu reached an unprecedented high price of 160 yuan. On Friday, it was slightly tired. On Saturday, it showed beauty again, with Yong Yarn reaching 3,700 yuan. Foreign stocks were initially sluggish due to tight money. On Wednesday, arbitrage buying started, and the price rose. It did not plateau until Friday, and on Saturday, it uniformly fell.</p>
<p>Spot Yarn In the past week, it was initially very mediocre. Later, due to the soaring prices of gold and stocks, and the fact that sales to customers were not bad, some yarn merchants still had thoughts of raising prices, and there were not many new sellers. There was a situation of demand exceeding supply in the market, so the situation gradually became high-flying. The highest for the whole week was 2.85 million for 60 count Sunlight on Friday, and the lowest was 500,000 for 10 count Huozhu on Monday. In terms of count, 42 count Lanhuang (Blue Phoenix) rose the most at 180,000, 20 count Te Shuangma (Special Double Horse) rose 160,000, and 16 count Guangming (Bright) rose 150,000. In addition, each yarn rose by 70,000 to 80,000.</p>
<p>Cloth Market Because customer sales were not smooth, the Textile Construction Company (Fangjian) sold a lot, and the number of chips was sufficient, so the rise was very slight. Peach Blossom, Lady Lin, and Ruyi bleached cloth each rose by 4,000 to 5,000, and the other brands rose by about 2,000 to 3,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Cotton Market Transactions were still smooth. The Textile Construction Company purchased first, followed by private spinning mills and flower merchants. The market situation was even tighter than that of yarn and cloth. According to people in the industry, the current flower price is still cheap, and the difference between the high and low yarn prices is huge. Yarn mills buy flowers and spin yarn, making huge profits, especially fine yarn. Therefore, buying is very strong. Each flower rose by 5,000 to 6,000 yuan compared to last Saturday.</p>
<p>Other As for other things, there were more rises than falls. After the food boom rose sharply on Friday, all goods were affected. Among daily necessities, matches were the most affected. The black market for fuel was rampant, and the market price was relatively high. White coal blocks have risen to 660,000 yuan per ton.</p>
<h3>Singapore Restricts Overseas Remittances; Overseas Chinese Eagerly Await Revision</h3>
<p>(Central News Agency Singapore 9th dispatch) Overseas Chinese here are deeply disappointed with the new overseas remittance regulations stipulated by the British authorities, which will take effect from March 18. It is generally believed that the monthly limit of 45 yuan for remittances is too low. The stipulation that no more than one remitter per family makes it even more difficult for overseas Chinese, because the family members themselves also have families in China, and these families in China still need to obtain financial assistance from them when the new remittance regulations are implemented. Overseas Chinese from all walks of life are considering the request of our Consul General in Singapore to the authorities to revise the new regulations.</p>
<h3>Customs Visa Office Begins Accepting Applications</h3>
<p>The Jianghai Customs Visa Office began accepting applications from all sectors for permitted and prohibited imports last Saturday. Before the application forms are printed, they can be replaced by official letters. It is reported that the office has accepted applications for importing films, automobiles, sugar, tobacco leaves, and other items, especially the most applications for importing automobiles.</p>
<h3>Economic Briefs</h3>
<p>According to the Fuel Management Committee, most of the coal-producing areas in the country have not been developed after the war. Currently, Shanghai's coal supply relies solely on Qinhuangdao, with approximately 100,000 tons shipped to Shanghai each month. The coal allocation method is to prioritize public utilities, followed by private factories.</p>
<h3>American Asphalt Felt Ships Arrive, Flattening Market Prices</h3>
<p>(Report from this newspaper) A large quantity of American asphalt felt arrived in early February. Due to various uncompleted procedures, the shipment was delayed and could not be released until recently, when it began to spread into the market in large quantities. As a result, prices gradually declined, nearly doubling the drop. Currently, No. 2 asphalt felt is selling for 25,000 yuan per roll.</p>
<p>In order to promote cultural exchange, the post office has now resumed accepting books, magazines, printed matter, and other items to the following locations. It is reported that each person can send two items each time, with a weight limit of 200 cm per item. It is reported that the areas where the post office has resumed accepting are Dongchuan, Xichuan, Guizhou, Yunnan, Guangdong, Tianjin (Jinbo Section), Beiping (Pingshi Section), Shandong (except Qingdao), Shanxi, and all locations along the Beining Railway.</p>
<p>Commentary</p>
<h3>Preliminary Suggestions for Enhancing Tea Production</h3>
<p>— Zhu Yanqing</p>
<p>Economic construction should first focus on increasing production. The scope of increasing production is extremely broad, with some starting from industry and others from agriculture. Our country is vast and rich in resources, and agricultural products are abundant. Although industrialization has been highly emphasized recently, industrial raw materials still cannot but be derived from agricultural products. Our country's agricultural products have traditionally been dominated by silk, tea, tung oil, etc. in foreign trade, and tea in particular is a necessity for daily use both domestically and internationally, so let's talk about tea first.</p>
<p>Chinese tea has many characteristics and is highly cherished by people in Britain, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union. It is only because Chinese people are accustomed to old practices and rarely conduct research, and the international market is frequently subjected to artificial obstacles such as "exclusion" and "dumping," that the export of tea has repeatedly risen and fallen. Now that obstacles in international trade are gradually being eliminated, at this time, if the government provides guidance and merchants are self-motivated, the sales of Chinese tea should not be difficult to gradually restore to their former glory.</p>
<p>The tea-producing areas of Yunnan and Sichuan provinces, although promoted by the government, are still small in quantity. The remaining tea-producing areas of Zhejiang, Fujian, Hunan, Anhui, and Jiangxi have mostly suffered from military attacks, and production has been greatly reduced. The free areas are also experiencing stagnation in sales due to traffic obstructions. Stored tea has piled up like mountains, with many instances of deterioration. Therefore, those engaged in this industry are all in a state of anxiety and cannot recover on their own. Now, in the autumn of economic construction, industrial and agricultural loans have been repeatedly organized by the government. The Shanghai Foreign Tea Industry Association has also applied for loans to the Four Joint Offices in writing, and has been approved to send representatives from the association to negotiate with the China and Farmers' Banks. Although the methods and quantities are still under negotiation, we hope that it will be realized quickly.</p>
<p>In addition to loans, there are several points that cannot be accomplished without official and civilian cooperation. (1) After obtaining loans, tea farmers and tea workers should strive to improve, such as cultivation, picking, baking, and packaging, all of which should be coordinated with export sales. Absolutely do not allow crude production, self-interest, and damage to overseas credibility. (2) Tea merchants should also diligently seek information on foreign markets to serve as a benchmark for production and sales. (3) In terms of exchange rates, there are generally two points worth noting: (1) those applicable to remittances to the interior, and (2) those applicable to the settlement of foreign exchange for tea exports in Chinese legal tender. If banks can reduce exchange fees as much as possible and relax settlement as much as possible, then increased procurement and promotion will naturally benefit. (4) In terms of transportation, from the production area to Shanghai, traffic is not fully open, and there are still many obstructions in various transshipments. The government should issue a notice to all land and water transportation institutions, such as the Zhejiang-Jiangxi, Shanghai-Hangzhou, and Shanghai-Nanjing railways, the Jiujiang-Ningbo ships, and highway automobiles, to provide transportation tools and facilitate them as much as possible, so that tea leaves can arrive in Shanghai as soon as possible, and can be exported as soon as possible. (5) In terms of warehousing, the nature of tea is not suitable for humidity, nor is it suitable for storing with other salty and fishy goods, so as to avoid flavor changes. Nowadays, there is a shortage of houses everywhere, not only in the production area to Shanghai, there are very few suitable warehouses along the way, but also many of the Shanghai warehouses have their fragrances and odors mixed up, and have been disorganized for a long time. This requires cooperation from many parties to facilitate storage. (6) There are many reasons for the decline of foreign trade, and the lack of diplomatic assistance is also one of them. It is either subject to import bans or subject to heavy taxes and price suppression. This has been frequently heard in the past, and Japanese tea is especially a strong competitor of Chinese tea. Fortunately, the power of Japanese tea is not as strong as before. The government should issue a notice to its consulates and commercial counselors stationed abroad to conduct investigations and provide information at any time. If any country has deliberately suppressed or hindered it, it should also strive to coordinate and reduce its current difficulties, which is to increase its competitive power.</p>
<p>The above points may not be exhaustive, but if we want to promote tea production and expand tea sales, I believe that it is not easy to be effective without advancing in multiple directions.</p>
<h3>Cotton Cloth Merchant Threatened with Extortion; One Pair of Gold Bracelets Not Enough; Police in Disguise Arrest Bandits in the Oriental Hotel</h3>
<p>(Report from this newspaper) Cotton cloth merchant Zhao Guanyun lives at No. 16 Wenyuan Lane, South Tibet Road. At 7:00 a.m. yesterday, three people in uniform suddenly came, claiming to be military police. They said that Zhao was suspected of being a traitor and demanded 1 million yuan in cash to settle the matter. Zhao said that he did not have such a large amount of legal tender, so he politely asked to replace it with two gold bracelets. The three people left with the bracelets. In the afternoon, a call suddenly came, saying that the value of the gold bracelets was not enough for 1 million, and that he had to bring more money to Room 216 of the Oriental Hotel to pay the balance. Zhao immediately reported to the Taishan Branch, and Zhang Rou, the chief of the Judicial Section, led four police officers in disguise to the hotel, where they arrested all the bandits and seized a pistol, which was taken to the bureau for investigation.</p>
<h3>Welfare Foundation Established</h3>
<p>The China Welfare Foundation Committee has been declared established under the leadership of Ms. Soong Ching Ling. The address of the association has been determined to be Room 201, No. 175 Suzhou Road. The association is an international relief organization for saving the poor. It has now received sponsorship from Lady Seymour, wife of the British Ambassador to China, who has raised a large amount of money, and will perform the drama "The Great Wall" at the Lyceum Theatre as a fundraising event.</p>
<h3>Pre-War Government Bonds: So-Called "Separate Measures" Intended This Way</h3>
<p>Since the financial authorities announced separate measures for the bonds issued before 1941, speculation has arisen in the Shanghai securities market. Some say that the government will pay with customs duties, while others say that they will be repaid with Sun Yat-sen notes. The most minimal observation is that the government may give considerable preferential treatment in consideration of the merchants' enthusiasm for bond tickets during the war. The speakers are numerous, and those who listen are moved. As a result, the market price of government bonds went from 100 to 1,000, and from 1,000 to 2,000. With this only bargaining chip, all are regarded as rare commodities. Recently, at the Second Plenary Session of the Central Committee, Commissioner Pan Gongzhan questioned the financial authorities. According to the Minister of Finance's reply on the 8th, the so-called separate measures are because most of the pre-war debts flowed into the occupied areas, and were looted by the enemy and puppets during the war. It is necessary to verify the looting situation and complete the registration procedures before payment can be restored. As for the payment of principal and interest on Sun Yat-sen notes, it is completely a rumor. (See Japanese newspaper special telegram for details) Speculators' dreams should now be awake.</p>

<h3>Thinking, Planning, Implementation</h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>In the reading community, the work of thinking is very important. Several philosophers have asked: "Don't just read, think." The meaning is that reading alone does not produce any effect, only thinking can bring benefits. In fact, this work of thinking can be applied to business management.</p>
<p>Educated people can understand the relationship between an idea and a fact. After thinking of an idea, one must also think of everything around and behind it. Many wrong facts are caused by a wrong thought, so before making a decision, you must think carefully.</p>
<p>To create the power of thinking, reading is necessary. There is a maxim for reading that is worth adopting, that is, "Don't read good books, read the best books." Because a person's time is limited and cannot read all the books, so choosing those best books is the only way. Many great books, great people, great problems, and great doctrines are the crystallization of thought.</p>
<p>In business management, "a good beginning is half the work done" is very accurate. Therefore, thinking, planning, and implementation can be said to be the necessary steps for dealing with every kind of matter.</p>
<h3>A Few Humble Suggestions for Improving the Dyeing and Weaving Industry</h3>
<p>— Da Kang</p>
<p>Since the dyeing and weaving industry was forcibly bought by the enemy and puppets in the 32nd year of the Republic [1943], its vitality has been greatly damaged. Afterwards, it could only be replaced by the manufacture of cotton and hemp yarn or rayon interwoven with silk, in order to avoid control. The factories themselves were able to barely survive, and the workers were also able to maintain a livelihood, so as not to be dragged into the whirlpool of shutdowns and unemployment. However, during the enemy and puppet period, excessive taxes and levies were imposed layer upon layer, which further aggravated the desperate situation. But the dyeing and weaving industry still hoped to endure hardships, withstand the pressure, and barely overcome difficulties, waiting for the arrival of light to relieve pent-up grievances. Now that the War of Resistance has been won, and the rivers and mountains have been restored, the long-cherished wish has been fulfilled. Moreover, as the government vigorously implements post-war recovery, the Ministry of Economic Affairs has stipulated that electricity for factory production should be supplied as much as possible, so that the injuries suffered over the past eight years can be restored. However, it is felt that the dyeing and weaving industry has always lacked a long-term vision, focusing only on the present, which has led to numerous difficulties and created serious barriers between the industry. This has enabled the enemy and puppets to take advantage of the opportunity, implement compulsory purchases, and deal a head-on blow, destroying the foundations of the dyeing and weaving industry that had been painstakingly built up over decades. Is this not painful? Therefore, based on my humble opinion, the areas that should be improved are described as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Business Competition: In the past, among the member manufacturers of the dyeing and weaving industry, few were able to operate self-dyeing and self-weaving with dyeing and weaving machinery. Most of them only purchased white fabric for dyeing or dyed fabric for customers, or wove various colors of fabric, with a bias towards one of these options. Therefore, small and medium-sized dyeing and weaving factories accounted for the majority, and their business operations were largely similar, crowding into one area, leading to competition among the same industry. Competition in business led to jealousy. In fact, there should be a spirit of concession. If one wants to seize everything for exclusive occupation, this kind of trust policy will inevitably fail. This is the first area that should be improved.</p>
<p>(2) Worker Treatment: During the War of Resistance, the increase in the proportion of salaried classes was the most backward. Compared with the multiple increases in the cost of living index, there was a clear difference between heaven and earth. Due to the surge in prices, the burden on workers became heavier and heavier. They were constantly worried, which affected their peace of mind at work. Therefore, the treatment of workers should be improved as much as possible, enough to support their families, so that they have no worries at home and no longer have to worry about the seven necessities of life [fuel, rice, oil, salt, soy sauce, vinegar, and tea]. Indirectly, the benefits to the factory will be invisibly enhanced. This is the second area that should be improved.</p>
<p>(3) Labor Welfare: The treatment of laborers in our country is insignificant compared to that of European and American countries. They can enjoy the "3-8 System," that is, eight hours of work, eight hours of education, and eight hours of sleep, which improves work efficiency. In contrast, the wages earned by laborers in our country day and night are not enough to support their families. The mental and material suffering they endure is countless. Therefore, we should also follow the previous example and seek a certain amount of rest time for laborers, and then instill knowledge to correct their thinking. This can also avoid the reckless actions of reactionary strikes incited by the outside world. Wouldn't this benefit both the factory and the laborers? This is what should be improved.</p>
<p>In summary, if we want the development of Chinese industry, not only should those in charge of the dyeing and weaving industry think big and not seek small profits (the so-called "being penny-wise and pound-foolish") and advocate it in the front, but those engaged in the industry should also abide by their positions, strive for development, and cooperate harmoniously. This will surely lead to the prosperity of the industry. It is hoped that the dyeing and weaving industry will recognize this early and not take it lightly.</p>
<h3>The Future of Seasoning Manufacturing Plants - Visiting Mr. Yao Junzhi of Standard Flavor Powder Factory</h3>
<p>— Fei Wen</p>
<p>Chinese cuisine has always been famous for its freshness and deliciousness. The fundamental difference between Chinese cuisine and foreign cuisine is that Chinese cuisine has already completed the seasoning work, while foreign cuisine only begins seasoning when it is eaten. Therefore, Chinese housewives pay very close attention to the application of seasonings.</p>
<p>In the past, Ajinomoto of Japan occupied the Chinese market and absorbed a large amount of surplus money from China. Later, although the seasoning products produced by the Chinese themselves gradually increased, Ajinomoto still sold in the Chinese market.</p>
<p>However, the situation will be completely different in the future. The Chinese and Southeast Asian markets will be completely markets for domestically produced Chinese seasonings. Therefore, as long as a seasoning manufacturing plant has established a foundation in the past and has a good reputation, it can develop on a large scale, and its future is limitless.</p>
<p>When the Standard Flavor Powder Factory was established seven years ago, it was during the August 13th Anti-Japanese War. The intention was that the war would eventually stop, and if we buried ourselves in hard work and won the praise of society, it would not be difficult to seek development after the war. Even during the war, it would be very worthwhile to sacrifice all assets as long as we could obtain a good business reputation. Therefore, when the raw materials for flavor powder were cut off and production could not continue, we issued "Xian Da Wang" soy sauce to contribute to families throughout the city.</p>
<p>Now that the war is over, we are embarking on the road of construction. However, what lies before us is not a smooth road, but a road full of thorns. At present, most factories lack manpower and financial resources, so the first step is to solve the manpower and financial resources. In terms of financial resources, we hope that people in the community who are interested in industry and care about the national economy and people's livelihood will invest. This kind of investment may not necessarily obtain unexpected windfall profits, but under a large cycle of factory development and stable people's livelihood, the benefits that can be obtained are not difficult to imagine. In terms of manpower, then each shareholder, in addition to investing, can also contribute their strength. Originally, the biggest advantage of the limited company organization is that it concentrates talent and can engage in cooperation. In this era when construction is more important than everything, the limited company should further develop its organizational strength. This point, it is hoped that the shareholders who invest in various limited companies will give it deeper consideration.</p>
<h3>Mexico's Efforts in Construction</h3>
<p>— Original by Michael Scully, Translated by Xu Baiyi</p>
<p>Worthy of Reference for Our Country's Industrial Circles</p>
<p>Mexico is a backward country, but in recent years, it has been working hard to improve and rectify itself, and it is very different from before. Therefore, when a traveler arrives in Mexico City to travel, if he hopes to see the kind of leisurely and romantic atmosphere as before, he will definitely be greatly disappointed. On the surface, we can still see those 18th-century buildings and the quaint Mexican character, but at the same time, we can more easily and quickly feel the busy traffic. Everywhere, we can see buildings using steel windows, and the roads are wider than before, just like Detroit City in 1920. The population is also increasing rapidly. In 1930, the city's population was less than one million, but it is now close to two million.</p>
<p>A traveler who is new to Mexico City can see many complex and intricate living conditions. Some people can buy shirts for seven dollars each, hats for twenty dollars, and suits for fifty dollars, but there are also many people who live in simple houses, have housing disputes, have black markets and other crimes. At the same time, he can also hear calls for a shortage of labor, the construction of a great hospital, and the near completion of a large sluice.</p>
<p>Mexico was going to embark on the road to industrialization long ago. When 1910 came, it was about to embark on the road to industrialization, but a revolution suddenly occurred, delaying the work for ten years. Then came the world depression, so true progress only began in 1930. The greatest impetus was generated by President Cárdenas, who forcibly invested many people's money in factories and construction projects. He completely nationalized the national railways, oil industry, and other industries, and managed and operated them by great national organizations. Therefore, many people had to live in Mexico City and needed family clothes, food, and all other supplies. However, because he did not take into account the result of many farmers abandoning agriculture and taking up industry, he was once troubled by the surplus of labor and the increase in the number of unemployed.</p>
<p>When the Second World War began, Mexico had to start manufacturing things that had always been imported from abroad. In order to encourage production, since 1941, the government exempted newly established factories from taxes and import duties for five years, thus creating the greatest opportunity for revival. In order to escape the high taxes in their own country, American capital flowed into Mexico in large quantities. The capital that had flowed out of Mexico to foreign countries flowed back into the country. The large-scale purchases by the United States further increased the amount of investment. They also built factories in the fields around Mexico, and the country invested 10 million US dollars to build steel mills, oil refineries, power plants, and water conservancy projects. In 1944, the total investment of national capital was 32 million yuan, which increased to 60 million yuan in 1945. In mid-September 1945, there was a largest enterprise organization with a total capital of 15 million yuan, which was the Wei Shi Ding Hao Electric Factory. American and Mexican bankers jointly invested in it, purchased 160 acres of land near Mexico City, and prepared to manufacture radios, electric refrigerators, electric irons, washing machines, and many other electrical appliances. The allocation of capital was 51% for Mexico and 49% for the United States.</p>
<p>Due to this facility, foreigners have more trust in Mexico, and various local industries are also increasing. In 1931, the entire Mexican film industry only produced two amateur films. In 1944, 83 films were produced in Mexican studios, with a total profit of 76 million yuan, becoming the third largest source of national income. At the same time, the publishing industry also increased sixfold compared to ten years ago, and the output of silverware manufacturing, textiles, and other products reached a number that had never been dreamed of.</p>
<p>Of course, Mexico still has its own difficult problems. Because there is an excess of 350 million yuan of currency, it has formed a state of inflation. The price of real estate has risen tenfold, and other things continue to increase. Even daily necessities have increased by two and a half times compared to 1940.</p>
<p>However, Mexico's future is optimistic, because of the following reasons:</p>
<p>(1) The government has sufficient financial resources to make its ideals a reality and will continue to adopt a cooperative approach with foreign capital. Since 1940, the government has taken care of farmers in the same way as it has taken care of workers, allowing them to have farmland.</p>
<p>(2) Mexico's industry has embarked on the road to electrification. Because Mexico produces very little coal, it uses oil and other substances to generate electricity. Two large power plants have been built in Mexico City. Water conservancy projects are also actively underway.</p>
<p>(3) The Mexican government knows that future development must first make transportation convenient, so it is also actively carrying out railway and road work.</p>
<p>(4) In order to absorb new knowledge, special technical personnel are sent to the United States to study. They themselves are also gradually able to transform and train many engineers and scientists.</p>
