<h3>政府組協議空氣緊張　決在政院設政委會　整軍原則獲三項協議</h3>
<p>〔本報重慶廿三日電〕政治協會小組會，連日協商，雖每日均有部份協議，但距離全部問題之解決尚遙。今日仍繼續協商，並開始綜合小組之工作，以便打開儮局，而免會期之一延再延。茲將廿二日各組成就探誌如後：（一）政府組織組　廿二日午前十時開五次會，中共復堅持以國民政府委會為最高權力機關，並要求改組十四個重要部會，强迫政府立予承諾，幾使協商無法進行，旋經青年黨提折衷案，先討論行政院組織問題，決定政院設政務委員會，使各方人士參加，政委十七至十九人可兼任部會首長，但權力相等，其名額分配在協商中。地方機構，共黨主張須改組，參加各黨派人士，但未獲通過。（三）軍事組　廿二日晨開會，協商頗爲順利，整軍原則獲重一至協議者有三，甲：軍黨分治，一切黨派不得在軍隊中作公開或秘密活動，現役軍人脫黨，軍隊教育獨立，任何政黨不得利用軍隊爲政爭工具等四項。乙：軍民分立，現役軍人不得任行政官吏，實行軍區制，劃分異於行政區，嚴禁軍人干政等三項。丙：整編軍隊，三人小組照預定計劃實施，共黨軍隊整編，此點中央表示兩月限期尚須考慮，國軍於六月內完成軍政部整編爲九十師之計劃，至三十六年度，全國軍隊混編為，六十或五十師，丁：在軍委會中設整編計劃考核委員會，各黨派可派人參加等四項。（三）綢領組　二十二日午後三時半開會，因各方距離尚遠，僅就外交，僑務兩部分加以討論，結果決定我國外交應與美·蘇·英平等友好實行大西洋憲章，保障世界和平及迅與各國簽訂新商約，保護僑胞利益等原則。（四）憲草組　二十二日午後開會時，會塲空氣極爲和諧，因各方一致贊同五權憲法之精神，且均能以客觀立塲看事之故，取得協議事項頗多，甲：全國選民於第二次國大應可行使四權。乙：普選制實行前，總統由縣省及中央各民意機關，各組選舉機關選舉之。丙：總統之任免與選舉，取同樣方式。丁：創制複決權之行使，另法言明。戊：立法院爲國家最高立法機關，相當其他國家之議會，委員由選民直接選舉。已：監察院爲國家最高監察機關，由各省級機會及各民族自治區城之議會選舉組成之，行使同意彈劾各監察權。庚：二司法院即爲國家最高法院，不兼理司法行政，由總統提名，經監察院同意而任命之大法官若干人組成之。辛：考試院爲委員制，各委員應起出黨派，其職權着重於公務人員及專業人員之考試。壬：行政對立法院負責，便不包滬不信任投案。又訊，今日上午軍事二組，下午施政綱領組均繼續會商。</p>
<p>〔中央社重慶廿三日電〕政治協商會議綜合小組會今日成立，下午四時舉行第一次會議，對各項問題作一透視之商討，並獲得若干協議，定廿四日繼續開會討論。按該會委員代表如下，王世杰·吳鐵城·陳啓天·王雲五·傳斯年·章伯鈞·張東蓀·周恩來·董必武，召集人孫科</p>
<p>〔中央社重慶廿三日電〕外記者招待會午後三時舉行，由吳部長國楨，劉次長錯及張參事平攀主持，並答詢問稱：政治協商會何時舉行大會，將視各小組委會進行情形而定。軍事三人小組，過去曾開會一次，現馬歇爾將軍已允任顧問，即當續行會商。</p>
<h3>大規模衝突漸減　共黨調軍區參謀人員赴平　俾接受執行部命令與方法</h3>
<p>〔本報北平廿二日電〕全國各地槍聲雖依稀可聞，而調處部工作與停戰命令並非絕對無效，執行部政府與共黨人員，今日一致承認下列事實：（一）各地正面與大規模衝突已日漸减少，如集寗，大同戰火已熄，泰安方面國共且已成立協會。（二）交通破壞事件，在基本上已較前减少，惟因少數破壞發生於停戰令生效後，故特受社會人士注意。但在此樂觀氣氛中，另一引人注意之消息，即共黨軍隊調動頻繁，且有逐漸向鐵路沿綫集中之趨勢，其意或在於交通恢復後，仍保持其鐵路之控制力歟。對於恢復交通，此間共方人士亦顯示其熱望，其新聞組發言人龔澎小姐曾語平記者，共產黨亦願交通早日恢復，數年以來共黨即深爲交通困難所苦，如過去延安與重慶共方人員即感無限隔膜，延安與戰區各地聯絡更無論矣，故周恩來與政府代表談判赤峯問題時，外記者詢及赤峯附近共產軍情形，固亦茫然無法作答。屢此次停戰，未能迅速而普遍實現，亦由交通困難，命令未能如期到達所致云云。</p>
<p>〔本報北平廿二日電〕過去一週中，已有和平天使八組自天而降，於全國槍聲最密之各區，其地名即集寗·赤峯·大同·張家口·濟南·徐州六組，係自重慶出發者，另有一組爲預備組，準備臨時派往發生重要衝突之地區。各組調處工作尚屬順利，根據今日執行部所發表第三號公報，濟南方面工作已近成功，集寗·大同已停火，赤峯方面情形不久亦可公布。各和平小組之補給，皆由執行部全部担任，近數日來，每日皆有飛機爲彼等和平天使運送器材·給養及一切必要工具，並有外籍記者隨往觀察，此間本國記者亦擬組織記者團，至和平恢復之重要地區參觀。</p>
<p>〔本報北平廿二日電〕執行部中最樂觀之人士觀測，舊年除夕前，華北遍地槍聲可望爲普遍之爆竹聲所代替。據悉，共黨方面已擬調派所屬十三軍區參謀人員來平，接受執行部停衝命令與方法，再返各軍區指揮所屬切實遵行，截止目前，到平之共黨參謀人員，已有冀熱遼及冀察晉軍區副參謀長及其隨員。昨日執行部發表第二號公報中所宣布停止衝突方法，一般皆認爲頗切實際，因其旣詳細規定停衝之步驟，復明示其目的。在停止衝突並撤離，至是非判斷及各種調動，當於稍後期內進行。距北平不遠之古北口區域，戰事似仍在進行，據傳該地共軍裝備極佳，士兵皆穿呢軍服，槍械亦銳利，蓋即取之日人者，國軍於該處曾陣亡團長一人。執行部第二號命令發布後，該處衝突亦可望依令完全停止，綏遠情勢仍頗緊張，傅作義將軍已派三十五軍參謀長賈文符來平報告並聯絡，各地槍砲聲紛至沓來中之執行部三方人員，仍於融洽空氣中向停戰目的邁進。作爲執行部辦公處之協和醫院，昨日起門口已由政府，共黨各派兵一名警衛，昨日首次値動者，爲憲兵廿團中士盧淸府及共黨某警衛班指導員胡貴平。記者詢彼二人在一起站崗有何感想，皆笑嘻嘻答稱：「我們兩人已談過了，我兩人之間絕沒有問題」。</p>
<h3>滇公路分局接管　中印油管國內段</h3>
<p>〔本報昆明廿三日電〕中印油管之外置問題，現已獲解決，國內段長千公里之油管與各地油池等，均由公路總局滇分局接管，該局及油管工程處辦理接交人員，定下月初沿油管沿綫實地點交騐收。至於油管工程處現有員工約二百人，一部份調京滬平津區工作，一部份遣散，此項結束事，可於三月底完成。此外，保密公路所屬之第一工程處（前設於密支那），亦已奉令於三月底結束，全部移交公路總局滇分局，對員工之處置，均與汕管工程處同。</p>

<h3>國府修葺工程　刻正在佈置中　主席辦公室簡單樸素</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿三日電〕據國已政府秘書沈勉厚語記者，京市之嚴重方荒，決不致遲緩政府還都之行程。艱巨瑣屑之國府修葺工程，需時約月餘，國府內部之布置·將由莊嚴整潔四字代表之。今日本報記者曾由國府警衛隊士二人總觀其全部，於一客室內獲見將來留備主席辦公室所用之簡單桌椅數具，及允稱撲素之布面沙發三四件，此簡單樸素之主席辦公室設備，逈不及今日京滬一部官吏的享有者。但預知此宵旰辛勞之一國元首，絕不致因其簡單而非薄之。曾為梁逆鴻志盤踞多年之國府辦公處所，其三四兩　已呈破毀，接收時尚見積水，昆頂則細草茸茸，最可慨者，矖牽上居然有小樹生長，梁逆殆已預卜其漢奸政治生命甚短，無往而不敷衍。國府西花園壁上，有江逆亢虎書刻之「西園雅集」，其筆跡之穢濁如其人，梁逆書勒之「重修西園記」文存名丕，想已爲守園者修脚刀剜去矣。</p>

<h3>維辛斯基抵英後　外交頓呈活躍　安全理事會昨開秘密會議　聯合國全體大會今日召集</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕據倫敦二十三日遮遮廣播稱：蘇聯出席聯合國大會之首席代表維辛斯基抵此後，外交活動頓形積極。安全理事會且舉行秘密會議，討論丙項重要問題：（一）聯合國秘書長選舉問題，（二）何日將希臘，印度尼西亞，及伊郞列入安全理事會議程問題。</p>
<p>先是維辛斯基往訪英外相員文，旋即在美國國務卿員納斯往住所舉行五强非正式會議，安全理事會會員十一人均參加討論，至下午始散。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕據倫敦二十三日廣播稱：原定今日召開之聯合國全體大會，已延至明日召開，屆時將討論原子能問題，昨日抵此之蘇聯首席代表維辛斯基亦將出席。</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敦廿三日電〕聯合國大會原定今日午後舉行之會議已取消，官方解釋原因稱，致治安全委員會不及備就關於原子能之報告書，於今日午後提交全體大會，故而取消此會議。</p>
<p>〔聯合社倫敦廿三日電〕聯合國機構今日暫將伊郎，希臘及東印度問題擱置一旁，逕行處理基本問題，其尤要者厥如組織原子能管理委員會，以保障世界安全。關於此事之特別提案，已交聯合國大會討論，其內容主張先設一委員會，研究原子能管理各種問題，然後向安全理事會提出具體建議。美國務鄉貝爾納斯今日宣稱，此英委員會組成後，即須囘華盛頓。同時，聯合國機構官方以爲伊朗希臘及東印度等案件，僅爲一時枝節問題，不信其足以引起危機。據大會主席史巴克稱，前途不需悲歡，吾人須認清目標，不可再蹈國聯覆轍，輕重倒置，置基本重大問題於不顧。</p>
<h3>聯合國委員會　分別開會議</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦二十三日電〕聯合國機構之六個委員會以及經濟社會委員會，均定今日開會。</p>
<p>〔聯合社倫敦廿二日電〕聯合國社會經濟理事會，已組成麻醉劑管理委員會。據該委員會首席代表稱，委員會第一步工作，將搜集全世界毒品生產出售及吸食統計，並將規定各國准許消費限度。中國爲產土主要國家之一，在戰前，該國人民有鴉片烟癮者佔全人口百分之三至百分之十。</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敦二十三日電〕聯合國經濟財政委員會昨開會時，英國動義請簽字於聯合國善後救濟總署協定之各國，續自其國庫收人項下提出百分之一，補助該署經費，未曾簽字於該協定之愛好和平國家，亦可請其加入。蘇聯代表當提出若干修正，希臘代表謂此一國際合作之初次實騐，已獲得驚人之成功。阿根廷代表謂渠以爲聯合國救濟總署之參加者，不必以聯合國會員國爲限，譬如瑞典及瑞士雖爲戰時之中立國，然在道義上之權威已遐邇皆聞云。</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敦二十三日電〕聯合國法律委員會，昨日下午開會，以二十二票對二十一票通過黎巴嫩代表庫里之建議，議決以後於選舉聯合國機構官員時不必提名，槪用秘密投票制，與大會主席史巴克當選之手續相同。該案如經大會通過，候選人之「提名」，當在會外決定矣。</p>
<h3>敘利亞代表指責　法國殖民地政策</h3>
<p>〔聯合社倫敦廿二日電〕叙利亞代表齊尼廷今日在聯合國託管委員會發表演說，攻擊法國以自治領地位給與委任統治地吐谷蘭及喀麥隆，斥爲變相的兼併行動。據稱，法國顯似躊躇，不願將其委任統治地立即交與聯合國管理，此種行動若經接受，則聯合國宗旨將被破壞。法國現正提出其片面之兼併行動，要求各國承認，叙里亞代表團次與拒絕，其理茶明。叙里亞政府之立場與紐西蘭相同，主張委任統治各國應完全遵守聯合國託管計劃，國際聯盟有時將不合法行動披上合法之外衣，今在聯合國中不應有此。英國代表瓊斯宣稱，若干国家間對於聯合國主持委任統治地仍有若干猜疑，託管委員會應即詢問委任統治和國，是否已準備將其委任統治地移交聯合國機構。</p>
<h3>原子之發展　可加速癌病之研究　並有助婦女不孕症</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓廿二日電〕美國公共衛生處處某官員今日稱：戰時原子炸彈之發展，「可加速癌病之研究」，但尚無治療癌病之希望。公共衛生處國立癌病研究院主任史班塞博士，相信原子之分裂產物，將成爲「痛之新的研究工具」。渠繼稱：「現今雖尚無人能斷定此種原子上新發展，即可在癌病之治療上，掀起新的革命方法」。史班塞博士之警告，謂：「我人愼勿過份樂觀，蓋此時對於分裂原子，即可助療癌病之說，尚難獲得確証也。美國患癌病人之死亡率，八人中約佔一人，現時割治與愛克斯光綫治療，仍爲醫生所採用之辦法，僅心臟病之致死率超出癌病之死亡率。原子分裂產物之癌，可發展爲相當大量之無綫電元素分子，該項無綫電元素分子，極有助於生物學上之探求，更有助於癌病之硏究。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞處東京廿二日電〕據稱原子炸彈對於人類，尚有生理上之驚奇功效。東京之報紙戴稱：廣島之婦科專家報告，謂有若十婦女，本屬不孕，現已　璋有望，而中年婦女亦有回復靑春之跡象。六月未產卵蛋之母雞，茲亦恢復生蛋。</p>
<h3>謀解決東印度局勢　英特使將作調人　獨立政府具英軍能早日撤退</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓二十三日電〕據此間可靠方面消息：荷蘭人士對委任英駐蘇大使寇爾爵士爲印度尼西亞之特別調解人一點，衷心表示歡迎。聞英外相貝文向倫敦之荷蘭外交人員謂：「寇爾爲最適適當之人選」。消息靈通方面認爲寇爾爾將子荷印副督總督范莫克返任後，抵達荷屬東印度。</p>
<p>〔聯合社巴達維亞廿二日電〕東印度獨立政府總理史嘉里爾今日發表宣言：對世界各國關懷爪哇局勢，表示感謝。據稱，蘇聯若不反對，願英軍留駐爪哇至日軍撤盡爲止。若英軍立即撤退，恐日軍拒絕機械，或竟抵抗。史氏希望英國充分信任東印度獨立政府，俟盟邦使命完成後，即可令英軍自爪哇撤退。東印度獨立政府未向聯合國呼籲，此舉將留待其他解決方法悉歸無效後方始實行。如有任何國家欲提出英軍留駐爪哇問題，自以蘇聯爲最適當，因其在大國中與東印度直接利害關係最少，更能以道義的立塲提出此案。</p>
<p>〔聯合社巴達維亞二十三日電〕英軍巡邏隊一隊，今日以重砲及坦克車從事肅淸泗水附近東印度獨立軍，英軍四名受傷。巴達維亞近郊曾遭搜索，東印度人被拘待訊者共有三百五十人。</p>
<h3>商震將軍等　離渝赴英　出席參謀長會議</h3>

<p>〔聯合社倫敦二十三日電〕菲律賓共和邦今日推舉國際法庭法官四人，計中國駐土大使徐謨博士、美國哈佛法律學院法官霍特森、前菲駐美委員特爾加杜、菲最高法院法官特查耶。</p>
<h3>關於太平洋戰略島嶼　艾克遜發表聲明　未經美同意不重更易管制</h3>
<p>〔路透社基盛頓二十三日電〕美國務副卿艾克遜昨稱：根據舊金山憲章，太平洋區具有戰略重要性之前日本島嶼，未經美國同意，不得更易管制。杜魯門總統最近宣稱，將向聯合國機構聲請在各該島鎭設立單獨之託治制，比頃聲請當向安全理事會爲之，即使五強之一因反對此項託治制而使用否次權，則各該島嶼勢必維持現狀，仍由美軍佔領。如安全理事會通遍美國之聲請，美國當任意在各該島佈置防務，關於軍略要地之聲請託治，應向安全理事會爲之，其他土地則向託治理事會爲之。通過以後商交全體大會議次。記者當提出問題，謂如安全理事會因否決權之使用而未能通過，美國是否不顧聯合國機構之意志，而繼續佔領並佈防各島。艾克遜氏於此未肯發表意見，僅謂此一問題當由更高級者答覆之。艾氏繼謂，在聲請託治以前，關於與軍略地直接有關之各國，當由通常外交途徑進行談判。太平洋區尚有前由不列顚自治領委治，而戰時由美軍解放之島嶼，此項問題當由美國與各自治領直接磋商，同時亦在安全理事會內討論之。在聲請託治以先，毋需舉行和平會議，將前屬日本之島嶼移交美國，此事可由通常外交談判或其他方法決定之。</p>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓二十二日電〕美國務副鄉艾克遜今日告新聞記者稱：三强在雅爾達會議時，曾成立一項協定，允許蘇聯在戰爭進行中得佔領千島羣島，但蘇聯之佔有爲暫時的，且僅爲佔領目的。艾氏謂，該項協定雖未規定千島羣島最後移歸蘇聯管轄，但其結果必然如此。渠謂關於戰前之日本屬地處置方法，雅爾達會議中並無其他秘密協定。美國如爲戰略關係，決意保留戰勝之土地，如冲繼島·硫礦島·或塞班島則必須提交聯合國機構之理事會決定，艾氏指出：倘此項請求被否決，美國仍有軍事佔領各該島嶼之檢。</p>
<h3>偽使王德陰　仍在西班牙</h3>
<p>〔合衆社屬德里廿二日電〕目下日本外交人員已在自西班牙前往馬尼刺途中，但中國傀儡政府駐西大使王德蔭，仍准予居留於西班牙。王氏現年五十歲，今日渠稱，彼於一九四二年接受此職，乃因渠之父親居住於中國日本佔領區內，設渠不予接受，恐日本人採取報復措置。中國駐英大使館人士今日告合衆社稱，重慶欲得王氏作漢奸審判，並謂中國政府旣無代表駐西班牙，勢須由駐葡公使辦理此項讓渡事宜。</p>
<h3>中美英印派員　調查日紡織業</h3>

<h3>法國繼任總統　古　盎可望當選　三大政黨一致擁護</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕據倫敦二十三日廣播稱：法國制憲議會，今日召開會義，討論選舉法國新主席問題，但因三大政黨（共產黨社會主義黨及天主敎黨）未能獲得協議，故毫無結果而散。</p>
<p>〔聯合社巴黎二十三日電〕法制憲議會議長社會黨領袖古盎·今日辭去議長職務，俾出任法國臨時總統候選人。社會黨領袖奧利沃被推爲議長候選人。</p>
<p>〔聯合社巴黎廿二日電〕法國政潮今日似已解決，制　議會議長社會黨領袖古盎尤爲臨時總統候選人，以繼戴高樂，社會黨亦宣布擁護。議會曾開短時間會議，旋即休會至星期三日選舉臨時總統，但或須遲至屋期四舉行亦未可定。共產黨原提出陶萊士爲該黨總統候選人，今日上午始行撤銷，向社會黨提議推古盎爲候選總統。古盎當初不願競選，乃由社會黨另推不管部閣員奧禮沃担任，共產黨立即表示反對。人民共和黨亦擁護古盎。共產黨提出古盎係「起黨派」行動，因古盎於去年十一月間經各黨一致選舉為議長，故此次當選，殆可預必。古盎於議會開會後，始允候選。議會方面預料古盎內閣明晚可以或立，舊閣負祗有少數更動。據共產黨權威方面稱，畢都爾繼任外長，該黨可不反對，畢氏係人民共和黨領袖，曾向共產社會兩黨提議，明日上午由三黨委員會舉行會議，預料可正式成立協調。議會定明日下午二時開會，人民共和黨若無反對，古氏即可當選。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞處巴黎廿二日電〕法國右傾三政黨，即共和統一黨，獨立共和黨，及農民黨，今日舉行聯席會議，討論如何在制憲會議中集合三黨活動之事。衆信無論三大政黨所提候選人爲誰，中和派代表不致投票贊成。據悉，中和派若干份子，或可投選第一次大戰時總理克萊孟梭之子密歇爾克萊孟梭爲候遠人，共和統一黨爲表揚戴高樂將軍在法國歷史上服務祖國之功績計，擬仍投選戴氏云。</p>
<h3>英屬馬來亞　增進工作效能適應戰時需要　英政府發表白皮書</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦二十三電〕英政府昨發表白皮書，宣布改組海峽殖民地及馬來聯邦之計劃，以後擬成立新加坡殖民地，及包括馬來亞九邦，及檳榔嶼麻拉甲兩地之馬來亞聯邦·去年十月英政府曾在國會作類似之聲明，而白皮書之計劃，則已將該項聲明予以擴大。白皮書建議使馬來亞聯邦及新加坡殖民地具有兩個獨立之總督，及獨立之行政及立法機構，此項改組可增進工作效能。以適應戰後之需要，向成立自治政府之途迅速推進。海峽殖民地之調整，於「海峽殖民地法」生效後，即可着手進行，該法現已提交國會審查。關於馬來亞諸邦，新法當使英王者權爲各邦立法馬來亞各邦首長經友好之討論後，已同意將每一邦之全部管轄權給與英王。馬來諸邦之統治者，仍爲馬來亞人民傳統上及精神上之統治者，故每邦中設咨詢委員會，由該邦首長任主席，處理有關加敎之各種問題。每邦首長同時亦爲聯邦中央咨詢委員會之委員，由馬來亞聯邦總督任該委員會主席，以檢討一切有關回敎之立法，並得經總督之同意，討論其他問題。故馬來亞各邦首長，不但担負有關本邦之責任，亦將担負有關整個馬來亞未來發展之責任。新馬來亞聯邦之中央當局，爲總督一人及立法暨行政委員會，每邦備設邦委員會，由中央當局賦與適當之權力。新政策之重要規定，尚爲馬來亞聯邦公民資格設立，凡生長於馬來亞之人，均取得馬來亞公民之資格。新加坡以其經濟及社會利益與半島各異，故暫不併入聯邦，但以後於必要時，仍可考慮合併。</p>

<h3>波光紺碧遠山蒼鬰如臨仙境　從基隆港到台北　本報航訊</h3>
<p>— 胡煒昌姚吉光等寄自台灣</p>
<p>在水雷尚沒有完全掃淸的航綫中，駛行了三天的航程，已安然到達了基隆，眞算是運氣！今天七時起身，在船首眺望。少頃，但見量巴如畫，大海洋中一二帆船，浪潮高低，海波之紺碧色，與遠山之蒼黃色，相映成趣。借船顚簸甚急，待輪舟進港，猶似走入畫中。四圍靑山綠水，艦輸帆船排列灣中，山上有屋舍，高低參差，斯境之佳，眞可與神話中之仙境媲美。</p>
<p>像美國兵到上海　在台北蹓躂</p>
<p>上岸後，我等往台北人員，再搭汽輪渡灣，乘火車，座位甚舒服，開經三山洞，沿途山川相連，鬱鬱葱葱，應接不暇，如此佳境，此生中尚　初見。抵台北後，有工礦處專車接往水電委司俱樂部暫住，出站即有大道與巍厦，橫亘於視錢之間，惟被摧毀者甚多。沿途樹木接踪，靑蒼可愛。此地人口稀少，遠遜上海多多，俱樂部地處大道之傍，前臨山川，有依正山，景物佳麗，空氣新鮮，登樓眺望，心曠神怡，氣候和暖如春，不需穿大衣及棉毛衫，購得台北市街圖逛玩，行街頭，眞像美國兵到上海時一樣，莫知所至。行人皆以驚奇之目光視之。</p>
<p>木屐代皮鞋居多　麻布制服裝</p>
<p>此間理髮一次計台幣六元，糖花生十元一斤，蓆子二百五十元一條，猪肉卅四一斤，水菓特別便宜。順道巡視公園，舊總督，公署等巍峨建築物，惜已遭摧毀，僅見美國水兵拿了“Camel”香烟在兜賣。合胞受日人壓榨結果，物資奇缺，尤其布匹和服裝等類很貴，街頭絕少見衣冠楚楚者，且很少穿皮鞋，多數穿木屐，亦有穿橡皮套鞋的，有些衣服，竟用麻布製成者。</p>
<p>大喫橘子波羅蜜　味美而價賤</p>
<p>晚上赴「新中華」酒家進餐，該館甚雅麗，菜亦佳，並有台籍女恃應生四名，殷勤招待。她們穿旗袍，中袖，畏身，赤足，穿舊皮鞋。飯後大吃橘子，波蘿蜜等水菓，價廉而物美，每斤約台幣二元光景。附近有“Carbinel”，跳舞塲，在三樓一方室內，無樂隊，僅唱片咿咿啞啞，接迎不斷。舞女亦遠遜上海。舞客多美國兵及上海去的同胞。晚上睡覺，是睡在「榻榻眠」上。蚊子不少，只得用帳子。</p>
<p>我才到二天，忙亂中隨便寫了以上的一些簡單報道。明天或要去北投溫泉，以後遊踪所至，當一一詳細叙述，茲不贅。（胡煒昌寄）</p>

<p>台灣鐵道雖曾由日本人經營發展，但其初創却還是國人。中國鐵道之建築，始於光緒初年上海至奧淞一段，當時路成即遭上海官紳之反對，路雖成即被擱置，反而視作廠鐵。時劉銘傳正督治台灣，以開發振興實業爲治合方針，見該路器材廢而無用，遂於光緒十三年奏准將該路撤至台灣，修成台北至基隆之一段，後又由基隆展延至新竹，此遂成爲中國初期興建之第二條鐵道。</p>
<p>我國最初期鐵道　興築于台省</p>
<p>馬關條約締結以後，日本爲了控制全台，加强他的榨取起見，極力經營台灣的交通，使它道珞四通八達，完成軍事佔領的功用。軍事渡過，經濟榨取降臨，在台灣除由日本完成各種獨佔外，並獎勵大企業私有財產制度，台灣的民營鐵道，也就在這種政策支持下，發展建立起來。今日民營路綫超過官營路綫之長度，其原因也就在此。</p>
<p>日本投降前，全台鐵道管理，是由台灣總督府交通局織道部主持，在該部之下，分台北·高雄·花蓮港三事務所，並有高雄·台北二修理工塲，目前均由台灣行政畏官公署交通處接收，成立鐵路委員會負責管轄。</p>
<p>官營鐵道東西部　呈擁塞現象</p>
<p>合灣的官營鐵道分東西兩部：東部正綫支綫之營業里程，計七二五·三公里，西部正綫支綫營業里程，計一七五·九公里，雙軌側綫總延長里程計七二四·九公里，全長綜計一六二六·一公里。</p>
<p>日本投降後，由交通處接收之各種車輛，計有：</p>
<p>機軍　二四〇輛　目前修復使用　一九九輛</p>
<p>客車　五一八輛　目前修復使用　三六輛</p>
<p>貨車　五八九二輛　目前修復使用　五〇四三輛</p>
<p>由於戰爭轟炸給台灣台道的損毀，以致目前鐵道交通不能恢復到戰前的承平運輸力量，呈現出擁塞現象，同時在整修工作的推進上，由於器材，工塲機件缺乏，也遭遇到若干困難。</p>
<p>合灣鐵道路軌與內地，各鐵道均不相同，東部的路軌寬爲二呎六吋，西部的則為三呎六吋，民營鐵道甚至有儘二呎寬的路軌，在進行整修工作期間，首先就感到了零件材料的缺乏。在日本統治合灣期聞，一切重要器材補給均抑仗於日本國內，台灣沒有一點自立能力，近幾年戰爭加諸於台灣的封鎖，已使過去蓄存的材料用盡，今日國內又無法生產，便造成了今日台灣台鐵道運輸力量，超過本身荷載力量的現象。</p>
<p>全台鐵道，共有一八九所車站，而今日接收人員過少，車行次數也較前减少，汽車停駛後行旅又見增多，這也是对台鐵交通擁塞的成因。</p>
<p>過去全台鐵道收支，年有盈餘，即在去年度日人擬定的全年歲出入預算看去，也是略有盈餘：歲入爲六五·一六六，七六〇日元·歲出爲四八·四三六·九〇三日元。</p>
<p>雖然由於戰爭的破壞，令這預算的收入减收三成，尚能維持其平衡，迄至日本投降後這正確的數字我們無法獲得，然而在交通處接管全台官營鐵道後，去年度十月份收入爲六·九四八·入〇三台元，十一月份收入爲六·九三一·九一一台元，十二月份收入爲七·三三入。八三四台元，但同年十二份的開支，則已達到一千七百萬元，與收入相較相差一千萬元之鉅，支收方面若再加上整修事業經費，其支出相差當更屬驚人。收支不平衡的主要成因，一方職工薪給增加，一方票價太低，無票乘客過多。目前正由交通處整頓秩序，一面更擬呈請當局增加票價，以資彌補。</p>
<p>已營鐵道極發達　長九千公里</p>
<p>台灣民營鐵道之修建，初由於製糖業本身需用運輸原料爲目的，最初儘限於蔗塲與工廠間之鐵道修建，後爲出品轉運方便，又展延銜接於官營鐵道，一部供自身運用，一部附售客票，委開營業。其後工礦業亦追而繼之，而造成台灣民營鐵道之發達。</p>
<p>合省民營鐵道，據民國三十四年九月之統計，情形如下：（由於戰爭損害，各綫損失的爲五分之二。）</p>
<p>全程營業綫爲六七三·九公里，專用綫爲二三五一·五公里。。目前各民營鐵道交通處尚未接管，仍由各組合自行整理，有已復原通車者，但均隨其工廠開工與吾爲轉移。（一月十五日，金德璋寄）</p>
<h3>福州之冬</h3>
<p>— 本報十七日航訊　曾今可寄</p>
<p>福州好像是沒有冬天似的。</p>
<p>福州冬天的氣候，似乎等於江南的仲春。福州幾十年中難得下一次雪，現在雖然是冬天，北平不必說，上海也早已開放水汀，或生起火爐了。在福州，不但沒有看見過穿皮袍子，皮大衣的，通穿夾大衣的都很少。</p>
<p>但福州並不是熱帶地方。</p>
<p>氣候太好　女子不嫁外省人　也許因為氣候太好的原因，福州的男子大多數不願到外省去就業，有的到了外省，過不慣，不久就回來。福州的女子也多數不願嫁給外省人。即使嫁了外省人，她的丈夫要回家鄉去，或是到別省去就業的時候，她也不願意同去，還有被迫走到了半路上，逃回福州來的。這眞是一種鎮爲有趣而又不可解的事</p>
<p>在抗戰期間，福州也淪陷過兩次，可是除了街頭用水泥建造的防禦工事還沒有拆去，和被敵人故意用炸藥去炸毀的省立醫院，還沒有修建之外，在福州全市，通一點戰爭的遣跡都沒有。和其他經過戰爭的大都市相較，福州可以說是有福的。</p>
<p>戎裝男女　處處者有其足跡　入冬又來，福顯得特別的熱鬧。首先是靑年軍二〇八八和二〇九兩師開來福州，戎裝的男女靑年到處都可以碰到·二〇入師在新生活俱樂部舉行了士兵作品展覽，並有生活晨覽及表演，參觀的人很多·還舉行了　觀會，招待福州籌士兵的家長。二〇九師也舉行了招待福州各界的晚會，並且有話劇電影等公演·二〇入師在靑年會球塲舉行的建國杯和建軍杯球類比賽，又熱鬧了好幾天。接着是省政府從永安遷回福州，各大街都紥了歡迎的牌坊。省黨部和靑年團支團部，不久也遷回福州來了，又照例熱鬧了一番。前幾天，財政部福建區直接稅局成立了，全省各縣的分局長和查征所主任，還有些稅務員，都到福州來晋謁新局長，旅館酒樓格外熱鬧。</p>
<p>溫泉浴室　可增進人體健康　福州有好些的溫泉浴室（都在城東），水含硫礦質，常洗可以增進健康。（這是上海所沒有的。）這些浴室，要算「百合」和「明園」設備最好，而這兩家的水，則不及「福隆泉。』「樂天泉』遠在飛機場附近的郊外，雙雙而去者較多。大一點的浴室都附設有餐室。冬天生意更發達。</p>
<p>商市繁盛　在暗中活躍異常　物價雖然高到戰前的幾千倍，福州的商業却日見繁盛·上杭街·下杭街一帶的大商行，都是在暗中大量批發或囤積，不做門市生涯·閩西閩北來福州辦貨的商人，都住在那些商行裏，不必住旅館。上海和台灣的交通恢復以來，福州商人（其中一部分是公務員）更形活躍，酒樓舞塲，他們是經商的大主顧，</p>
<p>冬防期間　皮箱被竊十一雙　現在本來是在冬防期間，省政府並且曾經下過命令：夜間十時以後不許通行。這樣一來，舞塲的營業就大受影響·不知道是怎麽一囘事，第二天的晚上居然就解了禁！說是福州的治安沒有問題嗎？也不然。有一個晚上，福州市商會會長蔡友蘭的店裏，就被賊偸去十一隻皮箱，價値聽說在千萬又上。</p>
<p>少女張玉貞因墮胎斃命，福州各報大登特登，這也是福州社會的一種反映。</p>

<h3>常熟農民的苦况</h3>
<p>編輯先生：我常熱血民們，</p>
<p>以萬分誠摯，乞借貴報寳貴</p>
<p>園地，將來函刊登，道是萬</p>
<p>分感謝的。</p>
<p>常熟早已號召着「復興農村」「普及敎育」這是何等美好的名詞！然而，敎育也未見進步；農村則反而被蹂躪了。國看過去的僞組織，有軍米咧；有糧米咧；有軍麥咧；有事業費咧；有牛捐、有猪捐、有船損，幾乎百姓之所有物，即被捐之目的物。——尤其是常熟，苛稅雜捐，罄竹難書，不惜以種種方法，榨取農民之血汗。鐵蹄下的同胞們，忍受着。他們那時雖不敢公然反抗，却是衆口交詛，怨聲載道了·吾窮苦農民們，上不能以事父母，俯不足以畜妻子，雖終歲動動，不免飢寒交迫·轉瞬八年，侵略者已屈膝，民皆翹首而望，以爲從此農、工、苦力所受的種種壓迫可以解放了，然而事實使吾們失望。你看！大則中共又殘殺了，小則盜賊又出現了。再歸到常熟來說吧。前日「商四民六借款」，民衆竭力的支持着，雖然政府經費是要的，然豈可只仰給於憔悴不堪的農民呢？近來，軍糧又要徵收了，租米又開追了。雖一然租米六折計算，但他們竟異想一天開，照市拆價，實在較去年「十折」還大，我們農民是良善的，不能抗令，祗得忍痛還租，恐怕開了差，『追租處」要七五折算。我前日目覩每石還了四千餘元（國幣），竟超出一石米之外。原來官價是法幣四千五百五十元，照七五折算，每石租洋法幣三千一百八十七元五角，又加上什麽出差費四百元，具結費四百元。差人的點心錢咧，地方相謝咧：唉！我農民們一年勞動，以有限之秋收，豈能塡無窮之慾壑？尤其是常熟的「催徵吏」大衣皮箱，大模大樣，一口官派，動不動就要鬧起來，以及一批的「管帳老爺」，倚勢欺人，「走狗」也耀武揚威，大出風頭。使我農民，對於種田也怨恨極了。雖然今年糶米還租，勉强支持，開年的父母妻子，便就不够吃了！（筆者就年年如此，苦不堪言。）米價倘使大了，漲了，吃一升，量一升，一定要受到凍餒。那時看看自己的田，又不能不種，不種要失業，失業要餓死的。於是祗得忍受着，含着熱淚，收緊了褲帶，有時「喘氣如牛」，有時「汗出如漿」，再用人力去「車水」與「分土田」。筆者再將種田每畝的開費，人工，肥料（約米一石六斗）和秋收（約一石入斗）相較，便知農民們的入不敷出，再加上還租，豈非大蝕其本嗎？然吾鄉農民男子在外（爲夥友爲僕人爲小販所以糊口也）找事做的，種田完全是女人小童拉扯成功的，所以出產也大大减低。况且他們常常符合着這首詩，—「二月黃新絲；五月　新毀，醫得眼前療；剜却心頭肉」。如此地「酉年吃空卯前糧」，更是應付不暇了。自命爲「達治天下窮治我，心向詩書力向農」的我，因爲不願做僞組織下之事，也弄得走頭無路；—現在希望政府切實减租，壓平物似，疏通來源，這才是對於農村是有利的。前日省府採辦軍糧，雖有六萬石之鉅，因爲由米商經辦，故無甚直接痛苦，間接影響而已。現在縣府又要辦糧，却是着重鄉鎭保甲，依田攤派，價爲法幣四千五百元，先付定金一成，餘在天上飛，姑不諭。今聞第一區辦六千石，試想：城中各鎭是不能出米的，前日鄉長會議，每戶最少要五斗，甚至有數石之鉅，我們農民如何負担得起呢？育定地說，此種辦法，非加以改善不可。如不然，一定要弄得鷄犬不寗；盜賊　起。當務之急的「普及敎育」「振興農村」不能再緩了，那時便不容貪官汚吏存在的！耕罷而　的靑年　者，一月十，日晨吃了些薄粥，趁暖寫于冷落農村破壞不堪的茅簷下。</p>
<h3>政協斷片　張申府談「分臟」笑話共談培講「猪玀」邏輯</h3>
<p>— 本報重慶訊濮德玠寄</p>
<p>「政協」四次會議，是在十五日上午九時舉行的。張君勵·莫德惠·葉劍英·因事缺席，王世杰·鄧顯超請病假，到會會員三十三人。主席孫科宣佈秘書處仍沒有收到任何提案，可作討論根據，請各位就綱領問題發表意見後，各方面的會員相機發表意見·張申府首先發言，又提到人民自由保陣爲使會衆安心，且可使人民知道會議是爲人民，而不是一些人想作官分臟。吳鐵城談到綱領形式時，說昨晚出席一個座談會聽人批評政治協商會義是一個政派會議，甚至可說是分贓會議，與美其名鬧什麽綱領，加在老百姓的頭上，倒不如戰時美國的各黨派，訂一個政治協約還好些。今天來轉告大家，作個參考·等中共董必武與靑年黨常乃惠，發表了他們的詳細主張後，　發基提出了「會中不要用分贓一類刺耳字眼，在外國，“Spoij　Syete”是一黨專政分爭爵祿的意思。對外界說是黨派會議的意見，他說英國憲法的重要文件一二一五的「大憲章」原先就只是貴族與皇帝的臨定，羅氏列舉「大憲章」的條文，說外人說政黨協約無法律根據沒關係，只要能代表人民利益，就可算作「大憲章」。陳布雷接着發方贊同張氏的意見，說「分贓」，「聯合政府」，「特務」，以及「刺耳」等等刺耳的名詞，在這和諧的議席上都不要用。接着，張申府承認了本會的會員，不是人民選出的，而是各黨派推出來的，但黨應該代表民衆，所以說是間接代表民衆，他强調民意並不難知。　　隨後，工業家李燭康發表他的國農民工的經濟方案，他說：「政府應多解決農民困難，工業應使人民多盡力」，他講了許多關於農田水利的建設方法大聲呼籲，可叫黨退出工廠，不要使工潮不得解決，影響生產事業·這時，已近一點鐘了。傅斯年放棄發言，黃炎培却站起來，有聲有色的大請其一猪崽』邏輯，說：「堂堂的國民政府之政權豈能曰贓？」在主張「從今日起大家不能用「分贓』二字之間，又來了幾個「分贓」。於是，吳鐵城又立起來，鄭重的申明：「分臟是會外人的意見，他不過是作笑話講，供大家參考而已·至此，主席宣稱將這問題交小組討論。秘書長報告了小組分組名單。王雲五提出意見，要求把無黨派的會員公推的綱領起草人傅斯年加入第二組，大家贊同。傳氏又要講話，張羣已經站了起來，一揮皮包，高呼「時間不足了吧！何必！」就此散會。「分贜」的字眼將不在協商會中出現，但是爲了也不使它在老百姓中間出現，袞袞會員諸公，却還應該把這兩字刻在心上，這是一般人的意見，同時是全國人民的希望。（元月十五夜）</p>
<p>社論</p>
<h3>討論憲草時應有的基本認識</h3>
<p>政治協商會議對於憲法草案曾有熱烈的研討，據說各方意見的距離亦較遠。憲法爲國家的根本大法，實在應該仔細研討。不過在關於憲法草案的研討上，有幾點値得我們注意：第一立法院所擬訂經國民政府公布的「五五」憲草，顧名思義，僅是一個革案，不是絕對不能修改的。國民大會召開了以後，自可根據此草案件必要的修正，以容納各方面集思廣益的珍貴意見。立法院院長及政府代表孫科氏在政協會議席上聲稱··「該項憲草，如有需修改之處，自可容納，」已表明了政府坦白的態度。有人以爲立法院擬訂憲草在此次大戰以前，其情形與令日逈異，因此必需修改：又謂立法院爲一政府機構，不能代表民意制定憲草，故須加以修正修又謂憲草擬訂於一黨專政之局勢下，應採納各黨各派意見，不能以一黨統治之觀念，加諸各黨各派。凡此所論，是否完全正確，我們値得加以注意。</p>
<p>憲法爲國家的根本大法，它次不因時世的變遷而常常變　。若說我國憲草擬訂於世界大戰前，今日局勢不同，因而必須修改，則我們試問美國的憲法，制定於一七八八年，經過不少戰爭，依理亦應常常修改。然而美國憲法在大體上還是一七八八年制定的舊物。至於立法院之擬訂憲革，原係根據國父遺敎；它不是一個制憲的機構，僅是一個擬訂憲法革案的機構，而制憲乃是國民大會的事。若說不能將一黨的觀念，加諸各黨各派，那亦是出題之言。今日的各黨各派包括共產黨在內，均曾公認三民主義爲建國的最高原则，是三民主義已非一黨之私，立法院根據三民主義精神，制訂憲草，並不曾將一黨的觀念强迫加諸各黨各派。上拉種種，都不能認爲五五憲草之必須修改的理由。不過，如前所述，立法院之擬訂五五憲草，雖經詳細研究，再三考慮，猶恐有未周之處，爲集思廣益計，各方如有珍貴意見，自應虛心採納，俾憲草能達到「至善」的境域，正不必再舉出什麽大理由來，好像「五五憲革」非完全推翻不可的陣勢。</p>
<p>在關於憲法草案的討論上，我們切須先有一種基本認識，這就是五五憲草爲三民主義五权憲法精神之所寄，而三民主義之爲我建國的最高原則，且經各黨各派所公認。故關於憲革的討論及修正，當以不越出三民主義之精神以及由三民主義而演化的五權憲法爲前提·任何修正案，只要能使憲革益臻美備，而同時更能發揚三民主義與五權憲法的精神，均可採納爲修正的根據。在我們論到國民大會的時候，會說：「今天政協諸公集議於陪都，切莫自已認爲在變法維新，更莫以爲在進行流血或準備流血的政治革命，乃是在公認在國民黨的領導下，在服膺三民主義爲建國的最高原則下，就國民黨所建立的政治體制，對當前的若干政治問題，作開誠布公約協商，圖謀於商討之餘，還要作進一步的協調。」我們必須先有此種基本認識，再來研討憲法草案，然後可又心平氣和的進行，得到精益求精的效果。</p>
<p>三民主義自有其政治體制，這體制就該表現在五權憲法中。這政治體制的形成，是國父經多年之研究與革命經騐之結果。「五五憲草」就是「五權憲法」學說所產生的憲法草案，它所以不曾全部採取流行於歐美的代議制及議會政治，却摘取了西歐民主政治的精華。而與我國固有的優良傳統相融合，創立了三民主義所特有的政治體系，於政權之外，復有治權，在洽權之下，於立法行政司法三權之外，復有監察考試兩權。這是一種新的政治嘗試，我們應該很珍視這種嘗試。西方的政治學者，囿於他們自身的政治經騐，對三民主義所欲建立的政治體制未能作超脫而客觀的檢討，情有可原，但我們中國人應從西洋人政治的偏見中解放出來。因爲五權之洽，在政治上是一種新的發明，原沒有西歐的成規可循，這在國父遺敎中早已提到。故我們若只知依照西歐的代議制度，或依在蘇聯建立的「蘇維埃」政治體制，硬來與三民主義所欲建立的政治體制並論，那真可以說是牛頭不對馬嘴，與三十年前留舉美國的法律博士對</p>
<p>國父說一只曉得有三權分立，從沒有總得過五權憲法，」一樣令人啼笑皆非。</p>
<p>日前有人說：「國民大會職權本可由立法院行使，何需有此龐大機構？又說：「可以立法院作爲下院，監察院作爲上院，運用各國兩院制之國會職權，兩院名稱同仍舊，惟職權擴大，不必有國會之名，但有國會之實。」我們聽了，祗有欽佩政論家瞋死害之本領。我們以爲三民主義如果有缺點，這缺點次不在它所欲建立的政治體制。三民主義所欲建立的政治的體制，有其一貫的系較，而且共中系分謹嚴，如一大厦，不能抽去一磚一石，隨便挖補。例如國民火會與立法院顯然是兩件束西，前者是獨攬「政權」的機構，後者是五種「治權」之一部，在三民主義五權憲法的體制下，系列分明，何可相况？今天老實說，政協諸公如果存心要推翻國父「機能分開」的寳貴學說，要取消國父五種治權並立的主張，則何必不率性大膽推翻之取消之，而乃欲如此偷天換日，移花接木，陽蒙五權憲法之「虎皮」，陰襲議會政治之「驢體」，以欺人欺己？國父九泉有知，如果看見道「五權憲法」精神所寄之「權能分開」學說，竟被若干只讀西洋死書的政客棄如敝履，而一般信奉</p>
<p>國父遺教者亦視若無覩，眞不知道他要怎麼痛心！</p>

<p>（本報訊〕市府當局鑒於邇來工潮迭起，參與調解之機關衆多，而事實上反不能收滿意之結果。爰決定嗣後任何勞資糾紛，如能自行協解決最好，如不得已申請各級機關調處時，爲求手續之統一，及符合行政法令起見，該機關等務須備文向社會局申請或備案。庶幾以後再發生同類事件時，社會局即可邀請該機關參與調處，以收實效。</p>
<p>電力工人提出條件　上海電力公司工潮迭經當局調解迄今尚未了結。最近公司於年底加薪時，因未能依照服務年代之久暫，與工作考勤之標準，多者二百餘元，少者僅一元半，致引起職工之不滿。乃由工會提起交涉，未有結果，公司並將工會理事十人開除。並傳尚有大批工人將遭停職，全體工人未免大起恐慌。南京路總公司，斐倫路配電所二處職工，乃於昨晨整隊赴楊樹浦發電廠，參加全體大會，決議向公司提出十一項條件。要求資方全部答應，否則全體二千八百餘人決不出廠。電流方面工人則組織保護隊，駐守各處。惟工會宜稱，決秉承當局意旨，不斷電流。截止昨晚尚未聞解決。當昨日下午三時，該廠工人集合時，資方曾請到警察一大隊，携帶機槍三挺，包閣入廠彈壓。惟該廠原有軍士一連駐守保護，警士事先未曾通知，致未能進廠。旋經軍警雙方負責者協商，並經工會電請黨政機關，保證不斷電後，警士乃奉命撤退。</p>

<h3>貢獻小意見三則</h3>
<p>— 杭州·蔣雨靑</p>
<p>（一）在重慶時，每逢精神堡壘處，升降國旗，必奏國樂，精神爲之一振。竊以上海之大，不可少此一舉。今提議在西藏路跑馬廳路交叉處，現在圓型所在，中柱一旗竿。朝晚由市政府派警吹奏國樂，同時行升降國旗禮節。此雖小節，亦所以敎育民衆之一道也。</p>
<p>（二）報載市敎育局對於私校收費有折衷辦法，這無非又是增加各家長的負担。鄙人站在家長地位，也想來一個折衷辦法：就是按月繳費。我以為學校革學費充當經費，當然是按月支付的。那末學生付費，也可以按月分付。這個辦法，在家長方面是有利，而學校方面大槪是無害而可以實行的罷。</p>
<p>（三）上海通南市的鐵門，聞已拆除，這是鏟除「租界」的遺影。不過上海是整個的，樣樣應該一律。像法商電力公司之用一百十瓦及美商電力公司之用二百二十瓦，在一個都市內應所不許的。鄙意市政當局應設法改善，以昭　一。</p>

<h3>香港幣制紊亂　當局頗感棘手</h3>
<p>〔路透社香港二十三日電）香港幣制之紊亂，乃行政當局最感棘手之問題，目前雖因當局之頒佈停兌令而未覺嚴重，然在恢復戰前貿易以前，此事必須獲得解決　在停兌令有效期內，珍珠港事件以前之舊存戶，每月僅得提取港幣二百元，戰前商業往來賬暨常地股票交易，均未有解決辦法，港元雖以英鎊及美元爲支持，惟無穩定之購買力，香港與中國有密切之關係，中國政治及金融之穩定，當可有助於港幣之穩定，最近數星期來，港幣隨法幣及美元之黑市而動盪不定，境外匯款之復活，亦爲跌價之原因，就表面上言，貨幣似不應因需要而貶値，然以匯款之收受人尚無正常投資途經，故多購取金條及貨物，遂使港幣之購買力爲之降低，資金之流入，固爲良好現象，但如不納入正軌，足以誘成通貨之膨脹，當停兌令撤銷後，預料混亂之情形必更明顯，最近若干銀行通告押款之人，謂前向日太淸算人結淸之押款，不能予以承認，銀行仍保留其抵押權，日太侵入後文件記錄之破壞，將使各大進出口行無從整理其債願及債務，再就港鈔之發行言，日本進佔之初，發行鈔票之銀行，其主持人在武力威脅下，不得不發行大批新鈔，此等鈔票，至少在目前尚未經發行之銀行承認，然在上海則有非正式之行情，此等鈔票以後是否得以某種兌換率交換，官方迄未有所指示，港政府對於穩定金融，不遺餘力，股票交易所復業，當可吸收大批游資，使其導入投資於企業及地產之正軌。</p>

<h3>戰後邊疆敎育　各盟旗用書繼續增進　邊疆學校將在京復校</h3>
<p>（本報南京特訊〕關於邊疆敎育，在戰前由敎育部設蒙藏敎育司掌管，在抗戰期問，是項敎育，仍積極進行。現當復員之際，聞南京方面，已籌設邊疆敎育館，準備進行硏究，並編譯邊疆文字工作，（如蒙回藏等之漢譯對照文字與詞典等）以佐助邊疆敎育事業之進行。同時敎部蒙藏司，對於邊疆各盟旗之學校敎科用書，除已有出版者外，仍在繼續增進中。並聞戰前設在南京曉莊中央政治學校內之蒙藏學校，早已改名邊疆學校，已來京力謀復校云。（愚）</p>
<h3>浙復員聲中　注意女子敎育</h3>
<p>〔本報杭州訊〕浙江敎育廳許廳長，對此次復員後之敎育工作，非常關心。至於女子敎育之復員，該廳在卅三年十二月問原定計劃，規定省立杭州女中，應於復員後次學期，在杭州復校，但因本省）卅五年度預算，中央核定，仍照上年度預算大數編列，故卅五年本省敎育經費，僅能勉强維持，原有事業無法即予規復。許廳長爲　澈復員計劃巾之施政實施起見，已另編復員經費預算，呈送省府彙編，呈請中央核撥，俟核准後，即可恢復省立杭州女中。同時許廳長在復員經費預算中，非特求省立杭州女中之恢復，當擬另添省立女中兩校，女子師範兩校，分佈浙東，冀浙有女子敎育之普及。（蝶）</p>

<h3>京市中小學敎　待遇已調整</h3>
<p>市校一月份起提高　私校待增學費調劑</p>
<p>〔本報南京專訊〕南京市中小學敎職員之待退，在未勝利以前，待遇極菲薄，不足餬口，自抗戰勝利，南京市政府社會局復員後，即着手整頓師資，於上年十月中旬，舉行中小學敎帥　審，計登記者約二千人，於十一月下旬，將甄審結果發表，錄取合格敎帥，中學部份，不足二百人，小學部份，七百餘人，對於中小學校長，大多數更動，少數留任加委，各校敎職員中，曾經參加甄審合格者，或仍留本校，或有所調動，其未合格者，則被淘汰。旣任用合格敎師，對於敎職員之生活待遇，亦逐漸提高。聞十月份按原來底薪加四十倍計算，外加生活補助費五千元，米貸金三千元，因此小學敎師待過，最高不過一萬二三千元，中學教師，最高待遇不過一萬六七千元。十一月份改訂「京市中小學敎職員待遇暫行標準，」中學敎職員，視學歷經歷之深淺成續，以爲　訂底薪大小之根據，小學敎職員，則以級數多寡，及担任課程之比較，爲底薪高低分配之標準，例如中學校長最高底薪，有三百六十元，職敎員最低底薪，有八十元者，小學校長，底薪最高有二百四十元，普通職敎員，最低底薪有六十元者，按六十倍加成計算，外加生活補助費七千元，米貸金六千五百元，（十二月份改爲七千元，）因此中學敎師待遇，最高在二萬元以上，小學敎師，最低待遇亦在一萬六千元以上。自本年一月份起，開將按照行政院修正公敎人員待遇標準辦法，照底薪八十倍加成計算，外加生活補助費二萬八千元，如此，則中學職員俸薪，最低在三萬五千元以上，敎師待遇，最低在四萬元以上，小學校長及主任敎師，最低在三萬五千元以上，最高可達四萬元以上，比前已較提高，生活勉可維持。並聞私立中學，待至寒假後，增加學費，初中學輩，一萬至一萬二千元之譜，高中學費，自一萬三千元至一萬五千元之譜，因此挹注，私校敎師待遇，亦可提高爲二萬元，至三萬五千元云。（愚）</p>

<p>自由談　婦女与家庭特輯</p>
<h3>發刋小言</h3>
<p>— 編者</p>
<p>「自由談」從今天起，每逢星期四，專登關於婦女和家庭方面的文字，在創刋的時候，似乎應該說一說我們的宗旨。</p>
<p>婦女運動，在中國的歷史並不長，但因爲各方面的努力，已有相當成效，今後應當參酌國內外的情勢，更求前進。因爲今後任何人都不能放棄他對國家社會所負的責任，有許多事情，正需要婦女界起來努力的。</p>
<p>關於家庭方面，那末由身而家而族，本來是中國歷代建國的程序，現在正當開始建國的時候，我們就可以致力於齊家的工作，因有齊家的工作，必須從修身做起，以及於治家之道。如果中國的家庭能移上軌道，中國的人民每一個將是優秀的國民；中國各地的社會，每一個地方將是完善而健全的；使建國的工作，可以事半功倍。</p>
<p>本刋所登載的文字，務求適合潮流，更求適應國情。因爲適合潮流而不適應國情，不免成爲紙上空談，適應國情而不適合潮流，未免故步自封，値茲創刋伊始，誠望各界賜予批評，讀者賜予匡敎。</p>
<p>兒童</p>
<h3>防止兒童自卑心理</h3>
<p>— 楊同芳</p>
<p>做任何事，要希望獲得成功，第一就是先要有堅强的自信心。一個人沒有自信心，覺得什麼都不如人，便會由失望而沮喪，一切工作都不敢去嘗試了。凡是沒有自信心的人，他一定不肯面對現實，沒有創造任何事業的勇氣和決心。</p>
<p>爲自信心的缺少，使會發生自卑的感覺。而自卑心理的造成，不但影響自身的事業，且有流爲心理變態的危險。有許多精神病患者最初多由自卑的感應而起。本來，每個人都有「自我表現』的趨向，自卑心理根本是沒有的。然而爲什麽有些人會發生自卑的感覺呢？大抵屢次的失敗，易使人沮喪灰心，終至養成自卑心理。常見做父母的，不了解自己子女的興趣和能力，屢他們的希望過高，而子女所表現的成續往往和他們父母的希望相差過遠，因爲子女們因受失敗的打擊，而致失却自信，養成自卑心理。所以成功的刺激常能鼓勵兒童的努力，失敗的反應每易發生自卑的感覺。還有些父母，過於溺愛自己的子女，平時不讓他們稍稍感到困難，什麽事都不敎子女獨立去做，即是普通的功課練習，也都由父母代庖，道樣養成子女一種不正確的感覺，那就是『什麽事都很容易成功』。他們就從不知道「成功』的眞正的意義。到子女一離開父母，沒人帮助時，便時時因遭遇失敗而沮喪灰心，以至懷疑自己，畏縮不前和怯弱膽小的不良心理便在這種情形下養成，自卑心理自然也由此造成了。</p>
<p>我們又常見一般敎師，自己以爲是數學認眞，把過難的功課給兒童去做，不明瞭「成功』對於心理的影響。兒童時時遭遇失敗，很少機會讓他們獲得「成功』的滿足。這般敎師們認爲在一班裏不及格的學生多，便足以表示他數學的認眞，不育馬虎。他殊不知一班學生不及格的愈多，造成自卑心理的也愈多。因爲兒童們都有一種『自我表現』的爭勝心理，不及格，留級，懲誡，對於他們心理的打擊是很大的，他們認爲自己即使是一些小的失敗，也會感到羞慚和恥辱的。</p>
<p>蒲亭敎授說：「學校中失敗的兒童，是精神病院的後補者。』我們要注意這普遍的嚴重的問題，於儘量使兒童多得到成功的機會，別把兒童的進取心，向上心斵傷了。我們要使兒業所做的工作，和他實際的能力，年齡，興趣相合，不要無端摧殘他們天眞活潑勇敢好勝的天性！</p>
<p>做父母和敎師的要鼓勵誘導兒童從事學習，不可輕易地責駡或懲罰他們，更不能對他們加以蔑視的態度，時常或輕易施行懲誠，有時並不見得就會發生敎育的效果，徒然增强他們對父母或敎師不接近不信任的反抗態度。而且把他們的自尊心喪失了，他們以後會更不努力，更不用心，甚至再怎樣勸導也不生效。我們要深切地了解：責備，譏刺，輕蔑，只有讓兒童造成沮喪，失望，自卑。</p>
<p>一個優良的父母和敎師，一定能了解兒童的個性和心理，避免一切足以養成自卑心理的刺激，時常引導兒童走向成功之路。合理的敎育方派，是根據兒童心理之科學的硏究方法，以同情的態度，訓練兒童的適應能力，依照兒童身心發展的正常狀態敎育兒童，指導兒童。</p>
<p>我們固然應該儘量使兒童多獲得成功的機會，使他們少受失敗的打擊，不致養成自卑心理。但我們也不應使兒童一直過「順境」絲毫不感受困難。一個人一生總不能完全避免失敗，在某種情形下，失敗正是成功的刺激。讓兒童知道怎樣由失敗而更加努力，因失敗而亟力克服困難，到是很重要的。父母和敎師，應根據自發活動的原則，使兒童在實際工作中學習，自己只處於指導鼓勵的地位，而不必完全出於代庖。</p>
<p>設法助長兒童的做事和學習的勇氣，也很要緊。防免自卑感覺的產生，並使確立自信，如發親兒童有身心上的缺陷，則應盡可能發展其所長，作積極合理的補償。</p>
<p>我們要慈母的懷抱，對付已有自卑感應的兒童，我們又須以醫生診斷的方法研究自卑心理的產生原因。兒童的人格，無論如何去予以尊重，他們脆弱的心，經不起大人們的凌辱和輕蔑。能够多替他們自己設想，總應多替他們設想。能够多替他們保持一分自尊心，總應多替他們保持一分自尊心。我想，大人們如果能以同情親切，誠懇眞摯的態度去安慰孩子的心，溫暖孩子的心，那他們定能勇敢工作，認眞學習，決不會養成自卑的懦佉心理。</p>
<p>職業</p>
<h3>介紹護士職業</h3>
<p>— 薛臨</p>
<p>我國抗戰的結果，是跟着整個同盟國家的勝利而獲得了全面勝利。在同盟国家的行列中，我國是四强或五强之一了，我們是聯合國組織中五個常任理事之一，戰後的我國，隨着國際地位的提高，而增加了對世界的責任。然而怎樣做一個强國，怎樣完成我們的責任呢？應當努力硏究各方面的情形。我現在不過談談關於本職業的一方面。國家的强弱，全在每個國民的工作努力。要是國民的身體不健全，怎樣還能努力工作，怎麽還能生產呢？怎麽還能振起精神苦幹呢？沒有强健的身體，只能消耗，無法談到生產。是以國家的進展，與醫學有很密切的關係。强盛的國家，醫學必定發達。看看英美等國，就可以知道醫學之重要。事實已告訴我們，不能再忽視。要使國家前進，要爲人類謀幸福，就得注意我們的問題—健全。尤其是戰後的餘生，經過難以形容的艱難困苦，經濟破產，營養不良，精神上受打擊，怎樣能使人人恢復常態，來參加復興建國的工作，這是目前的急務。各國和我國政府，對於這問題非常重視，已有計畫來求改革一新，報上已刊登善後救濟總署對於醫學的設計，是開辦六百五十五所大小醫院，需要聲護人員尤多。是以我特在此談一下護士職業，使社會人士能明瞭其眞相，而予以擁護及合作。護士職業是社會性的，爲大衆謀幸福而義牲自己的。接觸和工作的範圍，非常廣大，對男女老幼貧富等各階級的人，同等看待，而給以最優良的護理，使能早日恢復健康，並灌輸以衛生常識，使人人能預防疾病而保持健康。</p>
<p>護士職業是一種專業，爲應付人生較重要的問題，護士除須受專門的訓練和敎育以外，應有高尚的人格，認淸服務的精神。愛是護士的主動力。好比原子炸彈，浩大而有力，不顧一切而爲他人服務。</p>
<p>護士職業是一種科學，並且是與時代一同前進的。各種護病技術，均須應用科學原理，以期安全執行，而有相當或應有的成效。科學是前進的，常常有新的發明。科學是醫學和護病的甚礎。是以並驅邁進，有很密切的關係。</p>
<p>護士職業可以說是女子的專業。因爲她的性格溫和體貼，決不是男子所能比的。現在我國建設的時期，需要男子的地方很多。我們女子能有一種職業，來發揚我們的天性，而盡做國民一份子的天責，豈不是很好嗎？</p>
<p>現社會護士中，有不足以代表本職業者，一方面是因爲對於護業沒有眞切的認識，不過以爲這一種謀生之道，因此沒有服務的精神；另一方面是因爲普通學識過淺，而沒有受到相當的職業訓練和敎育，結果引起一般人士對於護士職業的鄙視，以致一部份靑年婦女，不願選擇這偉大的爲人類服務的職業。我國的護士，在數量和質量上都不足以適應我國的需要，希望這短短的介紹，能使社會人士對於本職業有相當的認識，又能引起靑年婦女對於本職業的興趣，而加入護士職業，加强我們的力量。對於我國復興建設的工作，能有更大的貢獻，同時使我國在同盟國家中，不愧為五强之一。</p>

<h3>革除歲首的惡習</h3>
<p>— 莉</p>
<p>不久我們又要逢到廢曆歲首，這時候我們正可以從事檢討，有幾種惡習慣是可以革除的，不妨去除沒有意義的舉動，而代以有意義的措置。</p>
<p>譬如說，父母們因爲疼愛孩子，就在年頭給他們所謂「壓歲錢」，孩子們拿到以後，不是去買些蕪謂的東西，就是去買了許多不淸潔的食品。我們不加給他們一點有意義的東西如書本之類；如果用玩具，那末要挑選有敎育意義的玩具，如果用糖菓，那末要挑選高尚而淸潔的糖菓。</p>
<p>在遇到了朋友親戚，通常終得說一聲「恭喜發財」，其實發財並不是人生最重要的事，似乎可以改用絞有意義的頌詞。</p>
<p>有許多迷信的舉動，諸如謝年，接財神之類，也可以革除，因爲這些舉動，祇是耗費錢財，實際上並沒有什麼益處。</p>
<p>現在我們要過的生活，是簡單而淸潔的生活，不再是虛僞腐敗的生活。</p>
<p>社會</p>
<h3>襄助完成保甲制度</h3>
<p>— 素文</p>
<p>上海市政府，已經公佈自本月十五日起全市同時整編保甲，淸查戶口，這一個舉動，在市政府的佈告裏，也曾加以說明，是地方自洽的基層組織，其健全與否，關係建國之成敗，至重且大</p>
<p>我們每一個家庭，應該甩十分的盛意，來喪助保甲制度的完成，有許多人，爲規避責任，不願意照實在情形塡寫表格，這其實是大可不必的，因爲中國正在走上民主之路，我們個人要得到國家的保障，要問問自己終究爲國家做了什麽工作。我們對於政府的措施，予以合作，我們就可以得到我們應得的權利。</p>
<p>同時，做一個現代的國民，決不能再採取「各人自掃門前雪」的態度，對於社會上的事，都要盡力去協助。</p>
<p>保甲制度，對於齊家的工作，有相當關係，我們並且希望政府方面，能够利用保甲制度，作成統計，決定施政的方針。</p>
<p>譬如說，利用保甲制度，可以調查出在上海一市，有多少文盲，就可以着手進行，怎樣在規定的期限之內，掃除文盲。</p>
<p>事實上，保甲制度，可以說是政府與人民之間的一個總福紐，所以襄助完成保甲制度，可以說是每一個人的應該盡力的。</p>

<h3>自製小玩藝</h3>
<p>— 蕭淑芳</p>
<p>現在市面上的玩物雖多，但價錢相當可觀，非普通人可以隨意購買。但我們不妨利用餘暇，將做衣服剩下的零碎料子理出，就用這類廢物，可以做一些有趣的小玩藝，必大爲兒童歡迎。</p>
<p>製法並不難，依照着小哈巴狗圖（下），將布塊尺寸大小剪下，照岡綫先將身體與內層縫合起來，成一圓筒形，肚下開口，中間做空心的，再將臉面（最好是用白布）縫合，內裝棉花（臉面露出的一部宜平整），將下端縫紥，再將兩耳安頭上，與頭部聯和縫緊（耳朶的地位要安勻），四是亦縫合，裝入棉花，然後安置如圖（上）。繪上臉面，頸間繫上絲帶，最後於帶上繫一小鈴，全部就完成了，不一定用絨布，普通用的布都可以。</p>
<p>小狗製法極其簡單。甚玲瓏可愛。兒童們一定很喜歡道小玩藝，諸位不妨試做。</p>

<h3>訪女靑年會托兒所</h3>
<p>— 董炎</p>
<p>如果你們有還不到學齡的孩子，而你們自己每天淸晨必得去辦公，直到黃昏才能回家，家裏沒有傭人或者不放心交給她，這樣，如何安置孩子勢必成爲最大的問題。在蘇聯，在西歐各國，他們隨處有托兒所代你照管孩子，等你辦公完畢後領回，只須納一筆低廉的費用。但在國內，即使是上海，也很難找到這樣一個理想的托兒所，能使你丟下孩子去安心做事。即使有，名額的限制，地段的偏僻，都有許多不便，所以我們希望以後托兒所會逐漸增加起來，這是一種神聖的服務工作。</p>
<p>據說全上海較具規模的托兒所只有二家，我訪問了隸屬於女靑年會的大西路六十六號托兒所。幹事陣善明女士，誠懇的回答我許多瑣碎的問題，她說：這裏的前身是職業婦女托兒所，創辦於四年前，去年三月因經濟關係合併了完全義務的勞工托兒所，現在有九十五個小孩受她們照管。最大的七歲，最小的僅十個月，內百分之三十納月費七千五百元（包括膳宿），還有百分之七十，除少數減費外，其餘完全免費，甚至衣服鞋襪都替他們弄好。這大部費用全靠女靑年會募捐而來，而最近捐款漸形減少，前途可處。房東又屢屢催請出屋，這兩點，陳女士希望各方給與助力。</p>
<p>善後救濟總署本來有麵粉配給，後來因爲聽說他們有一部份是收費的，通知要停配。這給他們的影響太大了。陳女士說她要向該署詳細解釋，說明有大多數是完全不收費用的。再替他們算一算，所收的月費剛够置小菜，所以職員薪金，燃料，衣服，鞋襪，水電，房租等項支出，還是沒有着落。他們現有廿個保姆兼敎職員，六個佣人，連陳女士和醫師共廿八個職員。有人以爲太多了，但請仔細地想一想：你們家裏如有四個小孩，一個普通傭人恐怕對付不了。所以實在是並不太多，要照顧得孩子安全，舒服，這還不是最理想的比例。</p>
<p>隨後陳女士領我參觀全所，樓下兩間是孩子遊戯，休息，吃點心的地方，窗前有一方大陽臺，二三十個活潑乾淨的孩子在隨意嬉戯，不怕羞，見人就叫『先生』，屋前還有一大塊空地，用鐵絲網攔起來。二三樓大都是孩子的臥室，每間房睡十幾人不等，一式的矮脚小床，白被單，課堂裏是小桌小樓，隨孩子的大小而分配。爲敎育與管理的方便起見，孩子們一共分爲五班，最大的一班約六七歲，漸次小下去，最小的一班便是十個月的嬰孩，站在床上爬着床欄練腿勁。</p>
<p>普遍的醫藥設備他們都有。倘患皮膚病，便要隔離起來住，傷風咳嗽則要在療養院裏靜睡，若不幸病勢沉重，便由家長帶回去，或由他們送醫院，等痊愈了再回來。</p>
<p>孩子們全日的生活如下：淸晨六七點鐘就起來吃粥，上午認字，講故事遊戯，吃中飯，下午的功課同上午一樣，大班要做算術，四點多吃豆腐漿，晚上吃麵或饅頭，七點鐘就要上床安睡，每天要洗一次脚，洗浴則每星期一次，在有規律的生活管理下，孩子們都長得白白胖胖的，有精神，有活力。</p>
<p>托兒所這一種組織，在我國雖非初創，但辦理得有成績的確還不多，如要推廣婦女職業，增進家庭幸福，那末托兒所是萬不可少的。而且這個孩子本身也極有好處，在幼小，就敎他們學會了團體生活，養成活潑的個性，這於他們長大以後的生活極有關係。新生的第二代應當是活潑潑，地賦有堅强的個性，能和社會融合起來的少年少女。</p>

<h3>Government Organization Reaches Tense Agreement, Decides to Establish Political Committee in Executive Yuan, Three Agreements Reached on Military Reorganization Principles</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Chongqing, 23rd] The Political Consultative Conference's subcommittees have been negotiating for days. Although partial agreements are reached daily, they are still far from resolving all issues. Negotiations continue today, and the work of the comprehensive subcommittee has begun to break the deadlock and avoid further delays to the conference. The achievements of each group on the 22nd are recorded as follows: (1) Government Organization Group: The fifth meeting was held at 10:00 AM on the 22nd. The Communist Party insisted again that the National Government Committee should be the highest authority and demanded the reorganization of fourteen important ministries. They forced the government to make promises, almost making negotiations impossible. The Youth Party then proposed a compromise to first discuss the organization of the Executive Yuan, deciding to establish a political committee within the Executive Yuan to allow participation from all parties. The political committee would consist of seventeen to nineteen members who could also serve as heads of ministries, but with equal powers. The distribution of their quotas is under negotiation. The Communist Party advocated for the reorganization of local institutions with the participation of all parties, but this was not approved. (3) Military Group: The meeting was held on the morning of the 22nd, and negotiations proceeded smoothly. Three major agreements were reached on the principles of military reorganization: A: Separation of military and party: All parties are prohibited from engaging in open or secret activities in the military. Active-duty soldiers must leave the party, military education must be independent, and no political party may use the military as a tool for political struggle. B: Separation of military and civilian affairs: Active-duty soldiers may not hold administrative positions, and a military district system will be implemented, with divisions different from administrative regions. Strict prohibition of military interference in politics. C: Reorganization of the army: The three-person group will implement the planned reorganization. Regarding the reorganization of the Communist Party's army, the central government indicated that the two-month deadline still needs consideration. The National Army will complete the reorganization of the Ministry of Military Affairs into ninety divisions within six months. By the 36th year of the Republic, the national army will be mixed and reorganized into sixty or fifty divisions. D: An assessment committee for reorganization plans will be established within the Military Affairs Committee, and all parties can send representatives to participate. (3) Program Group: The meeting was held at 3:30 PM on the 22nd. Because the parties were far apart, only the foreign affairs and overseas Chinese affairs were discussed. The result was a decision that China's foreign policy should be equal and friendly with the United States, the Soviet Union, and Britain, implementing the Atlantic Charter to safeguard world peace and promptly sign new commercial treaties with various countries to protect the interests of overseas Chinese. (4) Constitution Drafting Group: When the meeting was held on the afternoon of the 22nd, the atmosphere was extremely harmonious. Because all parties unanimously agreed with the spirit of the Five-Power Constitution and were able to look at things from an objective standpoint, many agreements were reached. A: National voters should exercise the four powers in the Second National Congress. B: Before the implementation of universal suffrage, the president will be elected by electoral organs composed of county, provincial, and central public opinion institutions. C: The appointment and removal of the president will follow the same method. D: The exercise of the rights of initiative and referendum will be clarified in separate laws. E: The Legislative Yuan is the highest legislative body in the country, equivalent to the parliament of other countries, and its members are directly elected by voters. F: The Control Yuan is the highest supervisory body in the country, composed of elections by provincial-level institutions and the parliaments of ethnic autonomous regions, exercising the powers of consent and impeachment. G: The two judicial Yuans are the highest courts in the country, not concurrently handling judicial administration, and composed of several grand justices nominated by the president and approved by the Control Yuan. H: The Examination Yuan is a committee system. All members should be independent of party affiliation, and their duties focus on the examination of civil servants and professionals. I: The administration is responsible to the Legislative Yuan, but it does not include motions of no confidence. Also, the military second group will continue to meet this morning, and the policy program group will continue to meet this afternoon.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 23rd] The Comprehensive Subcommittee of the Political Consultative Conference was established today, holding its first meeting at 4:00 PM. It conducted a thorough discussion of various issues and reached some agreements. The meeting is scheduled to continue on the 24th. The committee members are as follows: Wang Shijie, Wu Tiecheng, Chen Qitian, Wang Yunwu, Fu Sinian, Zhang Bojun, Zhang Dongsun, Zhou Enlai, Dong Biwu, convener Sun Ke.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 23rd] A press conference for foreign reporters was held at 3:00 PM, hosted by Minister Wu Guozhen, Vice Minister Liu Chi, and Councilor Zhang Pingpan, who answered questions, stating that the date of the Political Consultative Conference's general assembly will depend on the progress of each subcommittee. The military three-person group has met once in the past. Now that General Marshall has agreed to serve as an advisor, consultations will continue.</p>
<h3>Large-Scale Conflicts Gradually Decreasing, Communist Party Transfers Staff Officers of Military Regions to Peiping to Receive Orders and Methods from the Executive Headquarters</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Peiping, 22nd] Although the sound of gunfire can still be faintly heard throughout the country, the work of the mediation department and the ceasefire order are not completely ineffective. Government and Communist Party personnel of the Executive Headquarters unanimously acknowledged the following facts today: (1) Large-scale frontal conflicts in various places have gradually decreased. The flames of war in Jining and Datong have been extinguished, and the Nationalists and Communists in Taian have even established an association. (2) Incidents of traffic disruption have basically decreased compared to before. However, because a few disruptions occurred after the ceasefire order took effect, they have received special attention from the public. However, amidst this optimistic atmosphere, another noteworthy piece of news is that the Communist Party's army is frequently moving and gradually concentrating along the railway lines. Its intention may be to maintain its control over the railway after traffic is restored. Regarding the restoration of traffic, Communist Party personnel here also showed their eagerness. Miss Gong Peng, the spokesperson for their news group, told a Peiping reporter that the Communist Party also hopes that traffic will be restored as soon as possible. The Communist Party has suffered deeply from traffic difficulties for several years. In the past, the Communist Party personnel in Yan'an and Chongqing felt infinitely isolated, let alone the communication between Yan'an and various war zones. Therefore, when Zhou Enlai negotiated with government representatives on the Chifeng issue, he was at a loss and unable to answer questions from foreign reporters about the Communist Party's army situation near Chifeng. The failure to quickly and universally implement this ceasefire was also due to traffic difficulties, which prevented the orders from arriving on schedule.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Peiping, 22nd] In the past week, eight groups of peace angels have descended from the sky to the areas with the most intense gunfire throughout the country. The place names are Jining, Chifeng, Datong, Zhangjiakou, Jinan, and Xuzhou. Six groups departed from Chongqing, and another group is a reserve group, ready to be sent to areas where major conflicts occur temporarily. The mediation work of each group is proceeding smoothly. According to the third public notice issued by the Executive Headquarters today, the work in Jinan is nearing success, Jining and Datong have ceased fire, and the situation in Chifeng will also be announced soon. The supply of each peace group is entirely undertaken by the Executive Headquarters. In recent days, airplanes have been delivering equipment, supplies, and all necessary tools to these peace angels every day, and foreign reporters are accompanying them to observe. Local reporters here are also planning to organize a reporter group to visit important areas where peace has been restored.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Peiping, 22nd] The most optimistic people in the Executive Headquarters predict that before New Year's Eve, the sound of gunfire all over North China can be replaced by the sound of firecrackers. It is reported that the Communist Party plans to transfer staff officers from its thirteen military regions to Peiping to receive orders and methods from the Executive Headquarters to stop conflicts, and then return to their respective military region headquarters to command their subordinates to earnestly comply. As of now, the deputy chief of staff and his entourage from the Ji-Re-Liao and Ji-Cha-Jin military regions have arrived in Peiping. The method of stopping conflicts announced in the second public notice issued by the Executive Headquarters yesterday is generally considered to be quite practical because it not only specifies the steps to stop conflicts in detail but also clearly indicates its purpose. The judgment of right and wrong and various adjustments will be carried out in the later stages of stopping conflicts and withdrawal. The war seems to be still ongoing in the Gubeikou area not far from Peiping. It is said that the Communist army in that area is very well-equipped, the soldiers are all wearing woolen uniforms, and the guns are also sharp, probably taken from the Japanese. One regimental commander of the National Army was killed in action there. After the issuance of the second order of the Executive Headquarters, the conflict there is also expected to be completely stopped in accordance with the order. The situation in Suiyuan is still quite tense. General Fu Zuoyi has sent Jia Wenshu, the chief of staff of the 35th Army, to Peiping to report and coordinate. The three parties in the Executive Headquarters, amidst the constant gunfire from various places, are still moving towards the goal of a ceasefire in a harmonious atmosphere. As the office of the Executive Headquarters, the gate of Xiehe Hospital has been guarded by one soldier each from the government and the Communist Party since yesterday. The first to take turns yesterday were Sergeant Lu Qingfu of the 20th Regiment of the Military Police and Hu Guiping, the instructor of a certain guard platoon of the Communist Party. When reporters asked them what they thought about standing guard together, they both smiled and replied: "We have already talked, and there is absolutely no problem between us."</p>
<h3>Yunnan Highway Branch Takes Over Chinese-Indian Pipeline, Domestic Section</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Kunming, 23rd] The issue of the Chinese-Indian pipeline's external placement has now been resolved. The domestic section, consisting of a thousand kilometers of pipeline and oil pools in various places, has been taken over by the Yunnan Branch of the Highway Administration. The personnel handling the handover and acceptance of the bureau and the pipeline engineering office are scheduled to conduct on-site inspections and acceptance along the pipeline line at the beginning of next month. As for the current approximately 200 employees of the Pipeline Engineering Office, some will be transferred to work in the Beijing-Shanghai-Tianjin area, and some will be laid off. This closure matter can be completed by the end of March. In addition, the First Engineering Office (formerly located in Myitkyina) under the Secret Highway has also been ordered to close by the end of March and be completely transferred to the Yunnan Branch of the Highway Administration. The treatment of employees is the same as that of the Shantou Pipeline Engineering Office.</p>

<h3>Madame Chiang Bestows Medals on Soviet Soldiers in Changchun Yesterday, Broadcasts Comfort to the Masses in the Northeast Today</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Changchun, 22nd] Madame Chiang arrived here at noon on the 22nd, and senior Chinese and Soviet officials went to the airport to greet her. On our side were Zhang Jia'ao, Chiang Ching-kuo, Dong Yanping, Zhao Junmai, Jin Enxin, etc., and representatives of women from various places. On the Soviet side were General Leonov, the representative of Marshal Malinowski, the commander of the military region, and the regional commander, etc. We also had a guard of honor and a military band. The Soviet representative expressed to Madame Chiang that Marshal Malinowski was returning to his country for elections and did not know the exact date of Madame Chiang's arrival, and was rushing back here. Madame Chiang came here on behalf of Chairman Chiang to comfort the Allied forces and bestow medals and appease the people. Rest on the afternoon of the 22nd, the central personnel here held a dinner for Madame Chiang on the 23rd, and the medal awarding ceremony for the Allied soldiers was held on the same day. Marshal Malinowski hosted a banquet on the 24th. It is reported that the food prepared by the Soviet side was airlifted here from the Soviet Union. Madame Chiang will stay here for several days and will meet with people from all walks of life and women representatives.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Changchun, 22nd] After Madame Chiang landed in Changchun, General Leonov delivered a welcome speech on behalf of Marshal Malinowski, which read in substance: I only represent the Soviet Red Army stationed in the Northeast and Marshal Malinowski to express my warm greetings to Madame and her entourage. We are extremely fortunate to meet the outstanding social activist of the great Chinese people. Whether in the past, present, or future, we are willing to cooperate with the Chinese people who are fighting for their own liberation and who are friendly with the Soviet Union. I believe that Madame's presence here can also prove that the Soviet Red Army and the entire Soviet Union have always been good friends of the Chinese people and are willing to work side by side with the Chinese people to consolidate the victory over Japan and guarantee peace in East Asia. I wish Madame a successful mission here, long live the great people of China and the Soviet Union, long live Chairman Chiang, long live Marshal Stalin.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Changchun, 22nd] Madame Chiang is scheduled to broadcast at 1:20 PM on the 24th at the Changchun Central Bank to comfort the people of the Northeast. The Changchun Radio Station call sign is "XGOC" and its wavelength is [560] kHz.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Changchun, 22nd] When Madame Chiang entered the streets of Changchun from the airport, she was surrounded by welcoming citizens, and the cheers rose one after another like a raging tide. Madame, together with Chiang Ching-kuo, etc., Miss Kong Lingwei rode in the same car. When they were surrounded by the welcoming crowd, Madame got out of the car and walked on the snow, nodding and smiling frequently to show her gratitude to the crowd. Madame is visiting the Northeast for the first time. In addition to comforting the Soviet army, she is also comforting the people of the Northeast. A month ago, news of Madame's visit had been heard here. Women's circles in Harbin, Shenyang, and other places had already sent representatives to wait here at the beginning of the month. Now that they have seen Madame's demeanor in person, many in the cheering crowd shed tears along with their voices. Such touching scenes are the only ones the reporter has seen since arriving in Changchun.</p>
<h3>Repair and Traffic Conditions of Highways in Henan and Anhui Provinces</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 23rd] The National Highway Conference has been held for four days. According to the reports of representatives from various provinces, Henan and Anhui provinces are the most impoverished and the hardest hit. According to Li Wuqiao, Director of the Henan Provincial Highway Bureau, who attended the meeting, the greatest difficulties in repairing the highways in Henan Province are the shortage of funds and the lack of manpower. In terms of sections, western Henan is easier, eastern Henan is more difficult, and northern and southern Henan are even more arduous. At present, after repairs, driving from Didongzhen to Luoyang and Zhengzhou in western Henan is safer than before. The Shaanxi-Henan Joint Transportation Office has daily buses traveling between Luo and Zhengzhou, and there are no security problems along the way. Due to financial difficulties, the Henan Provincial Highway Bureau only has 150 employees. After the Japanese surrendered, the bureau received dozens of military vehicles, but they are still shelved due to lack of money for repairs. According to Ma Yimin, Director of the Anhui Provincial Highway Bureau, told our reporter that only more than a dozen counties in eastern Anhui and a few counties north of the Wo River are still in the hands of the Communist army. Approximately 2,662 kilometers of highways have been repaired in Anhui Province, and they are barely passable now. However, the road surface and bridges are far from standard. Although the Provincial Highway Bureau has several punts, a total of 24, only 15 are actually usable.</p>
<h3>Increase Gasoline Tax to Allocate Road Maintenance Fees</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 23rd] Road maintenance fees for national highways will be allocated from the increased gasoline tax in the future. This is a major resolution passed at today's Highway Conference and will be implemented once approved by the government. It was also decided that a National Highway Exhibition will be held in Peiping on August 1,000th of this year.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 23rd] The Highway Conference continued yesterday morning and afternoon. More than 80 proposals in the engineering category of the conference were all discussed and completed, including the approval of the plan to divide various highway improvement and road maintenance projects, and how to deal with pre-war private highways damaged by the war.</p>
<h3>Hefei to be Established as a City, Preparatory Office to be Established Immediately</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 23rd] Hefei News: The relocation of the Anhui Provincial Government from Lihuang to Hefei has become a reality, and the provincial government is moving. Hefei will be established as a city, and the municipal preparatory office will be established immediately, but the candidate for director has not yet been determined. There is a lack of housing in Hefei, and the construction cost of each department of the provincial government is estimated to be more than 30 million yuan.</p>
<h3>Nationalist Army Transported North by Sea from South China, Advance Troops Arrive at Goubangzi, Chairmen of Hejiang and Heilongjiang Provinces Depart to Take Over</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Peiping, 23rd] The Nationalist army that has entered Shenyang is still stationed in the historically significant Beida Camp and has not yet implemented the takeover. Xing Ying Commissioner Xiong Shihui is also temporarily staying in Jinzhou. The road between Peiping and Goubangzi can now be opened to traffic, and the roads between Ping, Chang, and Ha are expected to be opened soon. Therefore, most of the high-ranking officials of the Northeast provinces and cities who remained in Peiping will travel by train. More than 20 people from Xing'an Province will depart by train on the 23rd.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Jinzhou, 22nd] After our army took over Xinmin, there are still more than 20 Soviet troops stationed there, and there are still 50 in Zhangwu. On the 17th, the number of Soviet troops in Xinmin increased by more than 300, and the number in Zhangwu increased by 150. At present, we and the Soviet side can cooperate in maintaining local security. According to the person in charge of the Soviet army, in order to promote friendship between the two countries, they are willing to assist the National Army in clearing the surrounding bandits to ensure local peace. Based on the above situation, it is sufficient to show that the Chinese and Soviet troops are living together in the same city, and their relationship is extremely harmonious. Our troops transported by sea from South China to Qinhuangdao have arrived in the area one after another, and they have been dispatched to designated locations. The advance troops arrived at Goubangzi and nearby areas on the 22nd.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Changchun, 23rd] Wu Hantao, Chairman of Hejiang Province, and Han Junjie, Chairman of Heilongjiang Province, together with the takeover personnel and security team of the two provinces, left for Harbin by special train at 9:00 AM this morning and will go to Jiamusi and Bei'an to take over the provincial administration of the two provinces.</p>
<h3>National Government Renovation Project Underway, Chairman's Office Simple and Unadorned</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 23rd] According to Shen Mianhou, Secretary of the National Government, told reporters that the severe desolation of Nanjing City will not delay the government's return to the capital. The arduous and trivial National Government renovation project will take about a month. The interior layout of the National Government will be represented by the four words "solemn and clean." Today, reporters from this newspaper were escorted by two soldiers from the National Government Guard to view the entire building. In a guest room, they saw several simple tables and chairs and three or four simple cloth-covered sofas that will be used in the Chairman's office in the future. This simple and unadorned equipment in the Chairman's office is far inferior to the enjoyment of some officials in Shanghai today. However, it is predicted that the head of state, who works hard day and night, will never be treated lightly because of his simplicity. The National Government office, which had been occupied by the traitor Liang Hongzhi for many years, was destroyed in its third and fourth years. Standing water was still seen when it was taken over, and weeds were growing on the roof. What is most regrettable is that small trees actually grew on the railings. Liang Hongzhi probably predicted that his treacherous political life would be very short, and everything was perfunctory. On the wall of the West Garden of the National Government, there is a "West Garden Elegant Gathering" inscribed by Jiang Kanghu, whose handwriting is as filthy as the man. Liang Hongzhi's "Record of the Reconstruction of the West Garden" was inscribed, but it is thought to have been removed by the gardener with a knife.</p>
<h3>Chongqing Gold and Currency Prices</h3>

<h3>"North China Coal Industry Dictator" Shiratori Arrested for War Crimes; Investigation of Crimes of Other Japanese War Criminals Underway</h3>
<p>[United Press Beiping, 23rd] Shiratori, known as the "North China Coal Industry Dictator" during the Japanese occupation, has been arrested by the Chinese authorities in Beiping on suspicion of war crimes. He is one of the 34 Japanese who have been arrested. Shiratori was formerly the head of the British-owned Mentougou Coal Mine Company. After taking office, he accumulated a large amount of wealth and built many luxurious houses. Former members of the Japanese military police and senior officials of Japanese state-owned enterprises are also currently imprisoned in Beiping, but they are allowed to meet with relatives and friends every Wednesday and Saturday. On other days, they are allowed to receive packages and items sent by their families. The places where these Japanese war criminals live are all Japanese-style, with heating equipment in the rooms. All supplies are quite generous, and they are allowed to read books, newspapers, and play cards after meals. Chairman Chiang's "China's Destiny" in Japanese translation is used as required reading. These suspected war criminals are not confined to a room all day like ordinary war criminals. They are allowed to engage in considerable outdoor activities on a daily basis.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Beiping, 22nd] The arrest of Japanese war criminals who have harmed the people has continued for days, with reports from the party headquarters and various parties. According to the 11th War Zone Military Law Enforcement Supervision Department, as of last month, the department had arrested and detained a total of 32 Japanese war criminals based on reports from various parties. Their crimes are currently being investigated separately. After the investigation is completed, judicial officials from the court will be invited to conduct a joint trial and render a judgment in accordance with the law.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Tianjin, 22nd] The Japanese troops who surrendered their weapons in the northern section of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway have all been transported to Tianjin.

<h3>Vyshinsky's Arrival in England Enlivens Diplomacy; Security Council Held Secret Meeting Yesterday; United Nations General Assembly Convenes Today</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper] According to a Zhuzhe Broadcasting report from London on the 23rd: Since Vyshinsky, the chief representative of the Soviet Union to the United Nations General Assembly, arrived here, diplomatic activities have become more active. The Security Council held a secret meeting to discuss two important issues: (1) the election of the Secretary-General of the United Nations, and (2) the date on which Greece, Indonesia, and Iran will be included on the Security Council's agenda.</p>
<p>Previously, Vyshinsky visited British Foreign Secretary Bevin, and then held an informal meeting of the five major powers at the residence of US Secretary of State Byrnes. All eleven members of the Security Council participated in the discussion, which lasted until the afternoon.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper] According to a broadcast from London on the 23rd, the United Nations General Assembly, which was originally scheduled to convene today, has been postponed until tomorrow. The atomic energy issue will be discussed at that time, and Vyshinsky, the chief representative of the Soviet Union who arrived here yesterday, will also attend.</p>
<p>[Reuters London, 23rd] The meeting of the United Nations General Assembly originally scheduled for this afternoon has been canceled. The official explanation is that the Committee on Political Security was unable to prepare a report on atomic energy for submission to the General Assembly this afternoon, hence the cancellation of the meeting.</p>
<p>[United Press London, 23rd] United Nations agencies today temporarily set aside the issues of Iran, Greece, and East India, and proceeded to deal with basic issues, especially the organization of an atomic energy management committee to ensure world security. A special proposal on this matter has been submitted to the United Nations General Assembly for discussion. Its content advocates first establishing a committee to study various issues of atomic energy management, and then submit concrete recommendations to the Security Council. US Secretary of State Byrnes announced today that after the formation of this British committee, he must return to Washington. At the same time, United Nations agency officials believe that cases such as Iran, Greece, and East India are only temporary side issues and do not believe that they are enough to cause a crisis. According to General Assembly President Spaak, there is no need to be either pessimistic or optimistic about the future. We must identify our goals and not repeat the mistakes of the League of Nations, reversing priorities and ignoring fundamental and important issues.</p>
<h3>United Nations Committees Hold Separate Meetings</h3>
<p>[Reuters London, 23rd] The six committees of the United Nations and the Economic and Social Council are all scheduled to meet today.</p>
<p>[United Press London, 22nd] The United Nations Economic and Social Council has established a Narcotics Management Committee. According to the chief representative of the committee, the first step of the committee will be to collect statistics on the production, sale, and consumption of drugs around the world, and will stipulate the allowable consumption limits for each country. China is one of the main producing countries. Before the war, opium addicts accounted for 3% to 10% of the total population of that country.</p>
<p>[Reuters London, 23rd] At a meeting of the United Nations Economic and Financial Committee yesterday, the United Kingdom moved that countries that signed the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) agreement should continue to contribute 1% of their national treasury income to subsidize the expenses of the agency. Peace-loving countries that have not signed the agreement may also be invited to join. The Soviet representative put forward some amendments, and the Greek representative said that this first experiment in international cooperation had achieved amazing success. The Argentine representative said that he believed that participants in the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration should not be limited to United Nations member states. For example, Sweden and Switzerland, although neutral countries during the war, their moral authority has been widely heard.</p>
<p>[Reuters London, 23rd] The United Nations Legal Committee held a meeting yesterday afternoon and passed the proposal of Lebanese representative Couri by a vote of 22 to 21, resolving that there is no need to nominate candidates when electing officials of United Nations agencies in the future. The secret ballot system is used, the same as the procedure for the election of General Assembly President Spaak. If this proposal is passed by the General Assembly, the "nomination" of candidates will be decided outside the meeting.</p>
<h3>Syrian Representative Accuses France of Colonial Policy</h3>
<p>[United Press London, 22nd] Syrian representative Zini Ting delivered a speech in the United Nations Trusteeship Committee today, attacking France for granting the status of autonomous regions to the mandated territories of Togo and Cameroon, and denouncing it as a disguised annexation action. It is said that France seems hesitant and unwilling to immediately hand over its mandated territories to the United Nations for management. If this action is accepted, the purpose of the United Nations will be undermined. France is now putting forward its unilateral annexation action and demanding that various countries recognize it. The Syrian delegation once refused, and its reasoning is clear. The Syrian government's position is the same as that of New Zealand, advocating that all countries with mandates should fully comply with the United Nations trusteeship plan. The League of Nations sometimes puts illegal actions under the cloak of legality, and this should not happen in the United Nations today. British representative Jones declared that there are still some suspicions between some countries regarding the United Nations' management of mandated territories. The Trusteeship Committee should immediately ask the mandated countries whether they are prepared to hand over their mandated territories to United Nations agencies.</p>
<h3>Development of Atomic Energy Can Accelerate Cancer Research and Help Women with Infertility</h3>
<p>[United Press Washington, 22nd] An official from the US Public Health Service said today that the development of atomic bombs during the war "can accelerate cancer research," but there is no hope of treating cancer. Dr. Spencer, director of the National Cancer Institute of the Public Health Service, believes that the fission products of atoms will become "painful new research tools." He continued: "At present, no one can determine whether this new development in atoms can initiate a new revolutionary method in the treatment of cancer." Dr. Spencer warned: "We must not be overly optimistic, because it is still difficult to obtain definitive evidence that the fission of atoms can help treat cancer. The mortality rate of cancer patients in the United States is about one in eight. Currently, surgical treatment and X-ray treatment are still the methods used by doctors. Only the mortality rate of heart disease exceeds the mortality rate of cancer. The cancer of atomic fission products can develop into a considerable number of radioelement molecules, which are extremely helpful for biological exploration and cancer research.</p>
<p>[French News Agency Tokyo, 22nd] It is said that atomic bombs still have surprising physiological effects on humans. Tokyo newspapers reported that gynecologists in Hiroshima reported that about ten women who were originally infertile now have hope of having children, and middle-aged women also have signs of regaining their youth. Hens that did not lay eggs in June have also resumed laying eggs.</p>
<h3>Seeking to Resolve the Situation in East India, British Envoy Will Act as Mediator; Independent Government Hopes British Troops Can Withdraw Soon</h3>
<p>[United Press Washington, 23rd] According to reliable sources here: Dutch people sincerely welcome the appointment of Sir Kerr, the British Ambassador to the Soviet Union, as the special mediator in Indonesia. It is heard that British Foreign Secretary Bevin told Dutch diplomats in London: "Kerr is the most suitable candidate." Informed sources believe that Kerr will arrive in the Dutch East Indies after Deputy Governor-General Van Mook returns to office.</p>
<p>[United Press Batavia, 22nd] Prime Minister Skarir of the East India Independent Government issued a declaration today: Expressing gratitude to all countries in the world for their concern about the situation in Java. It is said that if the Soviet Union does not object, it is willing to have British troops stay in Java until the Japanese troops are completely withdrawn. If the British troops withdraw immediately, the Japanese troops may refuse to surrender their weapons or even resist. Skarir hopes that the United Kingdom will fully trust the East India Independent Government, and that British troops can withdraw from Java after the Allied mission is completed. The East India Independent Government has not appealed to the United Nations. This move will be reserved until all other solutions have proven ineffective. If any country wants to raise the issue of the stationing of British troops, the Soviet Union would be the most appropriate, because it has the least direct interest in East India among the major powers and can raise this issue from a moral standpoint.</p>
<p>[United Press Batavia, 23rd] A British military patrol today used heavy artillery and tanks to clear out the East India Independent Army near Surabaya. Four British soldiers were injured. Suburbs of Batavia were searched, and a total of 350 East Indians were detained for questioning.</p>
<h3>General Shang Zhen and Others Depart Chongqing for England to Attend Chiefs of Staff Conference</h3>

Gui, a member of the delegation, Yongqing will transfer to London from Germany.</p>
<h3>Zheng Tianxi Nominated as Candidate for International Court of Justice</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Geneva, 22nd Special Dispatch] Groups from several countries have nominated Dr. Zheng Tianxi, the Chinese judge of the Geneva International Court, as a candidate for judge of the new International Court of Justice. According to the decision of the Yijinshan Conference, the election is conducted by the United Nations General Assembly. Zheng Tianxi told reporters that he recently expressed to the United Nations Logistics Committee his willingness to waive his candidacy to help other Chinese candidates get elected. He is willing to use his experience to contribute to the cause of national construction. Zheng plans to return to China in July. If the new International Court of Justice has not yet been established in March, the current judges of the International Court of Justice will submit their resignations to the United Nations General Assembly, which is scheduled to be held in Geneva.</p>
<p>[United Press London, 23rd] The Republic of the Philippines today nominated four judges for the International Court of Justice, including Dr. Xu Mo, Chinese Ambassador to Turkey, Judge Horton of the Harvard Law School in the United States, former Philippine Commissioner to the United States Tergado, and Judge Tchaye of the Philippine Supreme Court.</p>
<h3>On the Strategic Islands of the Pacific, Acheson Issues Statement: No Change in Control Without US Consent</h3>
<p>[Reuters Washington, 23rd] US Undersecretary of State Acheson said yesterday: According to the San Francisco Charter, the control of the former Japanese islands in the Pacific region that are of strategic importance may not be changed without US consent. President Truman recently declared that he will apply to the United Nations agencies to establish a separate trusteeship system in each of these island towns. This application should be made to the Security Council. Even if one of the five major powers uses its veto power to oppose this trusteeship system, the islands will inevitably maintain the status quo and remain occupied by the US military. If the Security Council approves the US application, the US will be free to deploy defenses on these islands. Applications for trusteeship in strategically important areas should be made to the Security Council, and applications for other lands should be made to the Trusteeship Council. After passing, it will be submitted to the General Assembly for discussion. When reporters raised the question that if the Security Council fails to pass it due to the use of veto power, will the United States continue to occupy and defend the islands regardless of the will of the United Nations agencies. Acheson declined to comment on this, only saying that this question should be answered by higher-level people. Acheson continued that before applying for trusteeship, negotiations should be conducted through normal diplomatic channels with countries directly related to the military strategic areas. There are also islands in the Pacific region that were formerly mandated to be governed by British dominions and liberated by the US military during the war. This issue should be discussed directly between the United States and the dominions, and also discussed within the Security Council. Before applying for trusteeship, there is no need to hold a peace conference to transfer the former Japanese islands to the United States. This matter can be decided by normal diplomatic negotiations or other methods.</p>
<p>[United Press Washington, 22nd] US Undersecretary of State Acheson told reporters today that the three powers established an agreement at the Yalta Conference, allowing the Soviet Union to occupy the Kuril Islands during the war, but the Soviet occupation was temporary and only for occupation purposes. Acheson said that although the agreement did not stipulate that the Kuril Islands would eventually be transferred to Soviet control, the result would inevitably be so. He said that there were no other secret agreements at the Yalta Conference regarding the disposition of pre-war Japanese territories. If the United States decides to retain the conquered territories for strategic reasons, such as Okinawa, Iwo Jima, or Saipan, it must submit them to the Council of the United Nations agencies for decision. Acheson pointed out: If this request is rejected, the United States still has the right to militarily occupy these islands.</p>
<h3>Puppet Envoy Wang De Yin Still in Spain</h3>
<p>[United Press, Madrid, 22nd] Japanese diplomatic personnel are currently en route from Spain to Manila, but Wang De Yin, the puppet Chinese government's ambassador to Spain, is still permitted to reside in Spain. Wang, who is fifty years old, stated today that he accepted this position in 1942 because his father resided in the Japanese-occupied areas of China. If he had refused, he feared the Japanese would take retaliatory measures. Personnel at the Chinese Embassy in England told the United Press today that Chongqing wants Wang to be tried as a traitor, and that since the Chinese government has no representative stationed in Spain, the minister to Portugal will have to handle the extradition.</p>
<h3>US, UK, and India to Send Personnel to Investigate Japanese Textile Industry</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 23rd] The international textile delegation organized by the US State Department and the War Department departed for Japan on January 15th.

<p>[United Press, San Francisco, 23rd] Oil experts Egerov, Scanless Moore, and Robe, at the invitation of the Chinese government, flew to the Far East from here on the night of the 21st to conduct a preliminary survey on the development of Chinese oil.</p>
<h3>MacArthur Arrests More Japanese War Criminals, Matsuoka Yosuke Recovers and Surrenders to Await Trial</h3>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 23rd] MacArthur today ordered the arrest of another forty-eight war crimes suspects, ordering them to report to Sugamo Prison as soon as possible. The list includes three lieutenant generals: Nakano, former commander of the Japanese army in Batavia; Teshima, former commander of the Second Army; and Yoda, former commander of the Fifth Division.

They are scheduled to leave the US for Tokyo on February 1st.</p>
<h3>US Secretary of the Army Arrives in Berlin</h3>
<p>[United Press, Berlin, 23rd] US Secretary of the Army Patterson arrived here during his world tour and will stay for one day. He said that he sympathized with the homesickness of American soldiers, but he believed that Americans were gradually recognizing their responsibility to maintain peace in the future. The War Department hopes that in the future, all American occupation forces in Germany and Japan can be staffed by volunteers. The authorities of the four countries, Britain, the United States, the Soviet Union, and France, are still in consultation on the issues of determining the western border of Germany and organizing the central administrative institutions for the management of Germany. In order to break the deadlock, concessions may be made to France.</p>
<h3>South African Indians Appeal Against Property Freeze</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 23rd] The Executive Committee of the Natal Indian Congress of South Africa has decided to appeal to the United Nations to oppose the proposal to freeze property transactions between Indians and other ethnic groups in South Africa. However, this resolution has not yet been conveyed to the Indian delegation to the United Nations here. The group's leader, Mudaliar, said that he had not yet paid attention to the matter. This freezing proposal was announced by South African Prime Minister Smuts in the South African Parliament on Monday.</p>
<h3>France to Succeed the President, Gouin Expected to be Elected, Unanimously Supported by the Three Major Parties</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper] According to a broadcast from London on the 23rd, the French Constituent Assembly convened a meeting today to discuss the election of a new president of France, but it adjourned without result because the three major parties (Communist Party, Socialist Party, and Catholic Party) failed to reach an agreement.</p>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 23rd] The speaker of the French Constituent Assembly, Socialist leader Gouin, resigned from his position as speaker today in order to run as a candidate for the interim president of France. Socialist leader Auriol has been nominated as a candidate for speaker.</p>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 22nd] The French political turmoil seemed to have been resolved today, with Socialist leader Gouin, the speaker of the Constituent Assembly, being nominated as the interim presidential candidate to succeed de Gaulle, and the Socialist Party also announcing its support. The Assembly held a short meeting and then adjourned until Wednesday to elect an interim president, but it may be postponed until Thursday. The Communist Party originally nominated Thorez as its presidential candidate, but withdrew it this morning and proposed Gouin as the presidential candidate to the Socialist Party. Gouin was initially unwilling to run, so the Socialist Party nominated Auriol, a minister without portfolio, but the Communist Party immediately expressed its opposition. The People's Republican Movement also supports Gouin. The Communist Party suggested that Gouin's nomination was a "partisan" action because Gouin was unanimously elected as speaker by all parties in November last year, so his election this time is almost inevitable. Gouin agreed to run only after the Assembly convened. The Assembly expects that Gouin's cabinet can be established tomorrow evening, with only a few changes to the old cabinet. According to Communist Party authorities, the party may not object to Bidault continuing as foreign minister. Bidault is the leader of the People's Republican Movement and has proposed to the Communist and Socialist parties that a meeting of the three-party committee be held tomorrow morning, which is expected to formally establish coordination. The Assembly is scheduled to meet at 2:00 pm tomorrow. If the People's Republican Movement does not object, Gouin can be elected.</p>
<p>[French News Agency, Paris, 22nd] The three right-leaning French parties, namely the Republican Unity Party, the Independent Republican Party, and the Peasant Party, held a joint meeting today to discuss how to coordinate the activities of the three parties in the Constituent Assembly. It is generally believed that no matter who the three major parties nominate as a candidate, the representatives of the moderates will not vote in favor. It is reported that some moderates may vote for Michel Clemenceau, the son of World War I Prime Minister Clemenceau, as a candidate. The Republican Unity Party intends to still vote for de Gaulle in order to praise General de Gaulle's service to the country in French history.</p>
<h3>British Malaya, Enhancing Work Efficiency to Adapt to Wartime Needs, British Government Issues White Paper</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 23rd] The British government issued a white paper yesterday, announcing the plan to reorganize the Straits Settlements and the Malay Federation. It is planned to establish the colony of Singapore and the Federation of Malaya, including the nine Malay states, Penang, and Malacca. In October last year, the British government made a similar statement in Parliament, and the plan in the white paper has expanded on that statement. The white paper suggests that the Federation of Malaya and the colony of Singapore should have two independent governors and independent administrative and legislative bodies. This reorganization can enhance work efficiency to meet post-war needs and rapidly advance towards the establishment of self-government. The adjustment of the Straits Settlements can begin after the "Straits Settlements Act" comes into effect, which has now been submitted to Parliament for review. Regarding the Malay states, the new law will empower the British monarch to legislate for each state. After friendly discussions, the heads of the Malay states have agreed to grant all jurisdiction of each state to the British monarch. The rulers of the Malay states are still the traditional and spiritual rulers of the Malay people, so each state will establish an advisory committee, chaired by the head of the state, to handle various issues related to religion. Each state head is also a member of the Federal Central Advisory Committee, which is chaired by the Governor of the Federation of Malaya, to review all legislation related to Islam and may discuss other issues with the consent of the Governor. Therefore, the heads of the Malay states will not only assume responsibilities related to their own states, but also assume responsibilities related to the future development of the entire Malaya. The central authority of the new Federation of Malaya is the Governor, the Legislative and Executive Committees, and a state committee is set up in each state, which is given appropriate powers by the central authority. An important provision of the new policy is the establishment of Malayan Federation citizenship, and anyone born in Malaya will be granted Malayan citizenship. Singapore, with its economic and social interests differing from those of the peninsula, will not be incorporated into the Federation for the time being, but merger may be considered in the future if necessary.</p>
<h3>Zeiss Factory Equipment Emptied by Soviets</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Dresden, Germany, 23rd] According to the Potsdam Agreement on reparations, the Soviet Union has transported all or part of the machinery of 403 large and small factories in Ponxsoni back to the Soviet Union. Among them, there must be very important factory equipment, but since it is impossible to obtain a list of the disassembled parts, its value cannot be estimated. It is not known whether the world-renowned Zeiss Ikon factory, which is located in Dresden and specializes in manufacturing cameras, optical instruments, and telescopes, is also among the disassembled factories.</p>
<h3>General Hodge Issues Statement Denying Rumors</h3>
<p>[United Press, Seoul, 23rd] The rumor that the troops of General Hodge, commander of the US occupation forces in Korea, expressed opposition to the Moscow Conference's resolution to establish a five-year trusteeship system, was formally denied by General Hodge today. He said: "The rumors about incidents arising from his troops are all baseless." After seeing the TASS news report, General Hodge said that he would work hard to clarify the current situation and at the same time enable the Korean people to have a correct understanding of the issue of international trusteeship. He said that freedom of speech, publication, and assembly are permitted in areas under US jurisdiction, and he believes that this may have caused misunderstandings.</p>
<h3>Serious Labor Strikes in the US</h3>
<p>[Reuters, New York, 23rd] US Assistant Secretary of Labor Gibson announced last night that after 263,000 meat canning workers went on strike, the government may take over the striking factories today. Treasury Secretary Vinson and Attorney General Clark consulted with President Truman yesterday, probably to discuss the detailed procedures for the takeover. President Truman's press secretary, Ross, said that the White House had no definite new plan to deal with the steel industry strike, which affected over 1,200 factories. The current steel strike has affected the national railway utilities and the construction industry.</p>
<h3>Local Dispatches</h3>
<p>Suzhou: Gangsters Rob Liner and Shoot Passengers. The Yuanhe steamboat of the Tongyuan Shipping Bureau, which departed from Huzhou at 6:00 AM on the 20th, was robbed by bandits at 9:00 PM that day, when it was passing the Jiapu Bridge in Wujiang. Suddenly, ninety bandits came, riding five or six bandit boats, each holding guns and weapons, and firing shots, ordering the ship to stop. The bandits swarmed onto the ship, first disarming the escort soldiers, then shooting and robbing at will, shooting and killing a female passenger, Luo Tingbao, who was shot twice and died on the spot. The bandits then fled. After the ship returned to Suzhou, it reported to the military police and the local court for inspection. It was said that the loss from this robbery was extremely large.</p>
<p>Wuxi: Investigating the Economic Situation in Rural Areas. After the victory, the economic situation in rural areas in the Jiangnan area has not improved. The prevalence of usury has left farmers, who have suffered for eight years, still unable to catch their breath. In view of this, the government authorities are actively planning countermeasures to provide agricultural loans. It is reported that the Zhenjiang branch of the China Farmers Bank has sent Yao Gonglv, director of the Agricultural Loan Department of the bank, to Wuxi to investigate the economic situation in rural areas and collect relevant information in order to handle agricultural loans in the province. He has also sent an official letter to the Wuxi County Government to assist in the process.</p>
<p>Changzhou: Chairman Su Sends Telegram Welcoming Supervising Commissioner Cheng. On the day after Supervising Commissioner Cheng Zhongxing arrived in Changzhou on his inspection tour (the 21st), a forum was held at the Chamber of Commerce with local public organizations, attended by representatives from 53 units and more than 160 local elders. Commissioner Cheng said in his speech: "Inspecting the counties is not to engage in propaganda, but to be determined to put it into practice. When I was in Wuxi, I inspected the detention room and found that suspects were being detained arbitrarily. I immediately instructed the court to handle it. I once pointed out that a general social phenomenon is a cause for concern. I hope to assist in the investigation." After the speech, representatives of various public organizations expressed their opinions, and Commissioner Cheng instructed most of them to submit written requests for further action. In a separate conversation with reporters on the evening of the 21st, he said: "The spirit of the people in Changzhou seems to be quite depressed." Cheng is scheduled to inspect the judiciary on the 22nd. Chairman Su Wang Maogong sent a "special telegram welcoming" him to Zhenjiang to "inspect the customs and law." He is scheduled to leave Changzhou at 1:00 PM on the 23rd.</p>
<p>Songjiang: Tangqiao Robbery Causes Heavy Losses. In Tangqiao Township, Sijing District, Songjiang County, on the night of the 19th of this month, four bandits, speaking with a foreign accent, three wearing uniforms and one in civilian clothes, holding box guns and handguns, swarmed into the house of Tang Kunsheng in Xidongjing, forcing him to guide them. They then robbed the houses of Qiang Liu successively, taking away 15 million yuan in puppet currency, Zhang Boxing, taking away more than 200,000 yuan in puppet currency, the Zhang family, taking away ten large boxes of cigarettes, and more than 10,000 yuan in legal currency, the Zhu Shukun family, taking away a coat.

The unarmed Japanese troops have now been sent to concentration camps to await repatriation.</p>

<h3>Azure Waves, Distant Mountains Verdant: Like Stepping into Paradise - From Keelung Port to Taipei - Our Newspaper's Shipping Report</h3>
<p>— Sent from Taiwan by Hu Weichang, Yao Jiguang, and others</p>
<p>Sailing for three days on a route where naval mines had not yet been completely cleared, we arrived safely at Keelung, truly fortunate! Rising at seven o'clock this morning, I gazed from the ship's bow. Soon, a picturesque scene unfolded, with one or two sailboats on the vast ocean, the tide rising and falling, the azure blue of the sea contrasting beautifully with the verdant green of the distant mountains. The ship rocked violently, but as the steamer entered the harbor, it felt like stepping into a painting. Surrounded by green hills and clear waters, with warships and sailboats arrayed in the bay, and houses scattered on the mountainsides, the beauty of this place can truly rival the paradise of legends.</p>
<p>Like American Soldiers in Shanghai - Strolling in Taipei</p>
<p>After disembarking, we and the other Taipei-bound passengers boarded a motorboat to cross the bay, then took a train. The seats were very comfortable, and as we passed through the Sanshandong (Three Mountain Caves) area, the continuous mountains and rivers along the way were a feast for the eyes, so beautiful that I had never seen such scenery in my life. Upon arriving in Taipei, a special car from the Industrial and Mining Affairs Office picked us up and took us to the Water and Electricity Committee's club for temporary accommodation. Upon leaving the station, wide avenues and towering buildings stretched before our eyes, though many had been destroyed. The trees along the way were lush and lovely. The population here is sparse, far less than Shanghai. The club is located beside a main road, facing mountains and rivers, backed by Yizheng Mountain. The scenery is beautiful, and the air is fresh. Climbing the stairs for a panoramic view is invigorating and pleasant. The climate is warm like spring, and there is no need to wear heavy coats or cotton underwear. After buying a street map of Taipei, we wandered around the city, feeling like American soldiers in Shanghai, not knowing where to go. Passersby looked at us with curious eyes.</p>
<p>Wooden Clogs Predominate over Leather Shoes - Linen Uniforms</p>
<p>Here, a haircut costs six Taiwanese dollars, peanuts cost ten dollars a pound, a mat costs two hundred and fifty dollars, pork costs thirty-four dollars a pound, and fruit is especially cheap. We took a detour to inspect the magnificent buildings of the old Governor-General's Office and other government buildings, regrettably destroyed. We only saw American sailors selling "Camel" cigarettes. The result of the local people being squeezed by the Japanese is a severe shortage of supplies, especially cloth and clothing, which are very expensive. There are very few well-dressed people on the streets, and few wear leather shoes. Most wear wooden clogs, and some wear rubber galoshes. Some clothes are even made of linen.</p>
<p>Feasting on Oranges and Jackfruit - Delicious and Inexpensive</p>
<p>In the evening, we went to the "New China" restaurant for dinner. The restaurant was very elegant, the food was excellent, and there were four Taiwanese waitresses who were very attentive. They wore qipaos with medium sleeves, were slender, barefoot, and wore old leather shoes. After dinner, we feasted on oranges and jackfruit, which were cheap and delicious, costing about two Taiwanese dollars per pound. Nearby was the "Carbinel" dance hall, located in a room on the third floor. There was no band, only records playing softly, but it was constantly welcoming guests. The dancers were far inferior to those in Shanghai. The dancers consisted primarily of American soldiers and compatriots from Shanghai. We slept on "tatami" mats. There were many mosquitoes, so we had to use mosquito nets.</p>
<p>I have only been here for two days and have hastily written the above simple report amidst the chaos. Tomorrow, I may go to Beitou Hot Springs. I will describe my travels in detail later, so I will not elaborate further here. (Sent by Hu Weichang)</p>
<p>Starting with Special Industries - New Price Limits</p>
<p>Recently, prices in Taiwan have risen sharply, with merchants fueling the trend, seemingly without end. The Taiwan Provincial Administrative Governor's Office has instructed the Civil Affairs Department, the Police Department, and municipal governments to urgently seek countermeasures to suppress prices. They have repeatedly convened discussions with relevant industries and decided to start with special industries to conserve consumption. The regulations are as follows: (1) For hotels, the daily rate per room shall not exceed thirty dollars, and for ordinary hotels, it shall not exceed eight dollars. Hotels are not allowed to accommodate prostitutes, except for small inns. (2) Haircuts: The maximum price is six dollars, and electric perms are ten dollars. (3) Dance halls: Dance tickets cost twelve dollars for two books of ten. (4) Movie theaters: New films cost four dollars or less, old films cost two dollars or less, and children and soldiers pay half price. (5) For geishas pouring wine and singing ceremonial songs, a session with one geisha shall not exceed one thousand dollars. For a "heavenly official" (ceremonial performance) with five people or less, each person is five dollars per session.</p>
<p>Grade A Local Cuisine Limited to Five Hundred Dollars per Table</p>
<p>(6) Restaurants: Divided into three grades: A, B, and C. For local cuisine, the maximum price per table is five hundred dollars for Grade A, four hundred dollars for Grade B, and three hundred dollars for Grade C. Tips are limited to a maximum of 10%. The standard for each table is ten people. Western food: Limited to seven courses per person, divided into two-dollar and one-dollar options. Tips are limited to 10%. Diners eating in the dining hall are exempt from giving tips. (7) Rice dishes: Regardless of vegetarian or meat dishes, the maximum price for each dish shall not exceed one to five dollars.</p>
<p>Province Re-divided into Eight Counties - "Gun" and "Street" Changed to District Offices</p>
<p>Taiwan originally used place names such as "State," "Gun," and "Street." From this day forward, all will be changed to the "County System." The province is now divided into eight counties: Taipei, Taichung, Tainan, Hsinchu, Kaohsiung, Taitung, Hualien, and Penghu, with the eight "States" becoming eight counties. Next, "Gun" and "Street" will also be changed to District Offices. If the names already decided are inappropriate, research is currently underway. January 16th. (Sent by Jiguang)</p>
<p>Although Taiwan's railways were developed and operated by the Japanese, their initial construction was by the Chinese. The construction of China's railways began in the early years of the Guangxu Emperor with the Shanghai-Wusong section. However, after the completion of the line, it was opposed by the officials and gentry of Shanghai. Although the line was completed, it was shelved and even regarded as scrap iron. At that time, Liu Mingchuan was governing Taiwan and adopted the policy of developing and revitalizing industry. Seeing that the railway materials were abandoned and useless, he submitted a memorial in the thirteenth year of Guangxu, requesting that the railway be dismantled and moved to Taiwan, where it was rebuilt as the Taipei-Keelung section. Later, it was extended from Keelung to Hsinchu, becoming China's second railway.</p>
<p>Our Country's Earliest Railway - Built in Taiwan Province</p>
<p>After the signing of the Treaty of Shimonoseki, in order to control all of Taiwan and strengthen its exploitation, Japan vigorously developed Taiwan's transportation, making its roads accessible in all directions and completing its military occupation. Military occupation was followed by economic exploitation. In Taiwan, Japan not only completed various monopolies but also encouraged large enterprises and the private property system. Taiwan's private railways were developed and established under the support of this policy. Today, the length of private railway lines exceeds that of government-operated lines, and the reason lies in this.</p>
<p>Before Japan's surrender, the management of all of Taiwan's railways was under the jurisdiction of the Railway Department of the Taiwan Governor-General's Office's Transportation Bureau. Under the department were the Taipei, Kaohsiung, and Hualien Port offices, as well as the Kaohsiung and Taipei repair workshops. Currently, all are taken over by the Transportation Department of the Taiwan Administrative Governor's Office, and a Railway Committee has been established to be responsible for their management.</p>
<p>Government-Operated Railways, East and West - Showing Signs of Congestion</p>
<p>Taiwan's government-operated railways are divided into eastern and western sections. The operating mileage of the eastern section's main and branch lines is 725.3 kilometers, the operating mileage of the western section's main and branch lines is 175.9 kilometers, and the total length of double-track siding is 724.9 kilometers, with a total length of 1626.1 kilometers.</p>
<p>After Japan's surrender, the various vehicles taken over by the Transportation Department include:</p>
<p>Locomotives: 240 - Currently repaired and in use: 199</p>
<p>Passenger cars: 518 - Currently repaired and in use: 36</p>
<p>Freight cars: 5892 - Currently repaired and in use: 5043</p>
<p>Due to the damage to Taiwan's railways caused by wartime bombing, railway transportation cannot be restored to its pre-war peaceful transport capacity, resulting in congestion. At the same time, the progress of repair work is encountering some difficulties due to the lack of materials and workshop machinery.</p>
<p>Taiwan's railway tracks are different from those of the mainland and other railways. The eastern section's tracks are two feet six inches wide, while the western section's are three feet six inches wide. Some private railways even have tracks as narrow as two feet wide. During the repair work, the first thing felt was the lack of parts and materials. During the Japanese rule of Taiwan, all important material supplies relied on Japan. Taiwan had no ability to be self-sufficient. The blockade imposed on Taiwan in recent years by the war has exhausted the materials accumulated in the past. Now, domestic production is impossible, which has created the phenomenon that Taiwan's railway transport capacity exceeds its own carrying capacity.</p>
<p>There are a total of 189 railway stations in Taiwan. However, the number of personnel taken over today is too small, the number of train trips has also been reduced, and the number of travelers has increased after the suspension of automobiles. These are also factors contributing to the congestion of Taiwan's railway transportation.</p>
<p>In the past, the revenue and expenditure of Taiwan's railways had an annual surplus. Even in the Japanese-drafted annual budget for the past year, there was a slight surplus: revenue was 65,166,760 Japanese yen, and expenditure was 48,436,903 Japanese yen.</p>
<p>Although the destruction of the war reduced the revenue of this budget by 30%, it was still able to maintain its balance. Up until Japan's surrender, we were unable to obtain accurate figures. However, after the Transportation Department took over all of Taiwan's government-operated railways, the revenue for October of the past year was 6,948,003 Taiwanese dollars, the revenue for November was 6,931,911 Taiwanese dollars, and the revenue for December was 7,338,834 Taiwanese dollars. However, the expenditure for December of the same year reached 17 million Taiwanese dollars, a difference of 10 million from the revenue. If the cost of repair projects is added to the expenditure, the difference would be even more staggering. The main reasons for the imbalance between revenue and expenditure are that employee salaries have increased, ticket prices are too low, and there are too many passengers without tickets. Currently, the Transportation Department is rectifying order and is also planning to petition the authorities to increase ticket prices to make up for the deficit.</p>
<p>Private Railways Are Very Developed - 9,000 Kilometers Long</p>
<p>The construction of Taiwan's private railways was initially for the purpose of transporting raw materials for the sugar industry. At first, it was limited to the construction of railways between sugarcane fields and factories. Later, to facilitate the transportation of products, it was extended to connect with government-operated railways. Part was used for its own operations, and part was used to sell passenger tickets and operate commercially. Later, the industrial and mining industries followed suit, resulting in the development of Taiwan's private railways.</p>
<p>According to statistics from September of the 34th year of the Republic of China, the situation of private railways in the province is as follows: (Due to war damage, two-fifths of each line was lost.)</p>
<p>Total operating lines are 673.9 kilometers, and dedicated lines are 2351.5 kilometers. Currently, the private railways have not yet been taken over by the Transportation Department and are still being reorganized by the associations themselves. Some have been restored and are open to traffic, but all depend on the start of operations in factories. (Sent by Jin Dezhang on January 15th)</p>
<h3>Winter in Fuzhou</h3>
<p>— Our Newspaper's Shipping Report on the 17th, Sent by Zeng Jinke</p>
<p>Fuzhou seems to have no winter.</p>
<p>The winter climate in Fuzhou seems to be like the late spring in Jiangnan. It is rare for Fuzhou to have snow in decades. Although it is now winter, not to mention Beijing, Shanghai has already turned on the heat or lit stoves. In Fuzhou, not only have I not seen anyone wearing fur coats or fur overcoats, but even those wearing lined overcoats are few.</p>
<p>But Fuzhou is not a tropical place.</p>
<p>The Climate Is Too Good - Women Do Not Marry Men from Other Provinces - Perhaps because the climate is too good, most men in Fuzhou are unwilling to work in other provinces. Some who go to other provinces cannot get used to it and soon return. Most women in Fuzhou are also unwilling to marry men from other provinces. Even if they marry men from other provinces, if her husband wants to return to his hometown or work in another province, she is unwilling to go with him. There are even those who are forced to go halfway but escape back to Fuzhou. This is truly an interesting and inexplicable thing.</p>
<p>During the Anti-Japanese War, Fuzhou was occupied twice, but apart from the concrete fortifications built on the streets and the provincial hospital that was deliberately destroyed by the enemy with explosives and has not yet been repaired, there are no traces of war in the entire city of Fuzhou. Compared with other major cities that have experienced war, Fuzhou can be said to be blessed.</p>
<p>Men and Women in Military Uniform - Their Footprints Are Everywhere - Coming to Fuzhou again in winter, it seems particularly lively. First, the 208th and 209th divisions of the Youth Army came to Fuzhou. Young men and women in military uniform can be encountered everywhere. The 208th Division held an exhibition of soldiers' works at the New Life Club, as well as a morning review and performance, which many people visited. It also held a viewing party to entertain the parents of the Fuzhou conscripts. The 209th Division also held an evening party to entertain people from all walks of life in Fuzhou and had drama and film performances. The 208th Division held the National Construction Cup and Army Building Cup ball games at the Youth Association ball field, which was lively for several days. Then, the provincial government moved back to Fuzhou from Yong'an, and welcome arches were erected on all the major streets. The provincial party headquarters and the Youth League branch also moved back to Fuzhou soon after, and it was lively again as usual. A few days ago, the Fujian Regional Direct Tax Bureau of the Ministry of Finance was established. The directors of the branch offices and tax collection offices of all counties in the province, as well as some tax officials, came to Fuzhou to pay respects to the new director, and the hotels and restaurants were especially lively.</p>
<p>Hot Spring Bathhouses - Can Improve Human Health - Fuzhou has many hot spring bathhouses (all in the east of the city). The water contains sulfur minerals, and frequent bathing can improve health. (This is something that Shanghai does not have.) Among these bathhouses, "Baihe" and "Mingyuan" have the best facilities, but the water in those two is not as good as "Fulongquan" and "Letianquan," which are far away in the suburbs near the airport, and are often visited by couples. The larger bathhouses all have dining rooms attached. Business is even more prosperous in winter.</p>
<p>The Commercial Market Is Prosperous - Unusually Active in Secret - Although prices are thousands of times higher than before the war, Fuzhou's commerce is becoming increasingly prosperous. The large businesses in Shanghang Street and Xiahang Street are all wholesaling or hoarding in large quantities in secret and do not do retail business. Merchants from western and northern Fujian who come to Fuzhou to buy goods stay in those businesses and do not need to stay in hotels. Since the restoration of transportation between Shanghai and Taiwan, Fuzhou merchants (a portion of whom are civil servants) have become even more active. Restaurants and dance halls are their major customers.</p>
<p>During the Winter Defense Period - Eleven Pairs of Leather Shoes Were Stolen from a Suitcase - It is now the winter defense period, and the provincial government has even issued an order prohibiting traffic after 10 PM. As a result, the business of dance halls has been greatly affected. I don't know what happened, but the ban was lifted the next evening! Does that mean that there are no problems with public security in Fuzhou? Not really. One night, eleven pairs of leather shoes were stolen from a suitcase in the store of Cai Youlan, chairman of the Fuzhou Chamber of Commerce. The value is said to be over ten million.</p>
<p>The death of the young woman Zhang Yuzhen due to an abortion has been heavily reported in all Fuzhou newspapers, which is also a reflection of Fuzhou society.</p>
<p>Reader Opinion</p>
<h3>The Plight of Farmers in Changshu</h3>
<p>Editor: We, the passionate people of Changshu,</p>
<p>With the utmost sincerity, beg to borrow your esteemed newspaper's precious</p>
<p>Space to publish the following letter. We will be immensely grateful.</p>
<p>Changshu has long been calling for "revitalizing the countryside" and "universalizing education." What wonderful terms! However, education has not improved, and the countryside has instead been ravaged. Looking back at the past puppet organizations, there were military rice, grain rice, military wheat, business fees, cattle donations, pig donations, and boat damages. Almost everything the common people owned became the object of donations. - Especially Changshu, with its countless exorbitant taxes and miscellaneous donations, ruthlessly extracted the blood and sweat of farmers by various means. The compatriots under the iron heel endured it. Although they dared not openly resist at that time, they cursed in unison, and complaints filled the air. We poor farmers could not support our parents above nor provide for our wives and children below. Although we toiled throughout the year, we could not avoid hunger and cold. In the blink of an eye, eight years passed, and the invaders had surrendered. The people all looked up in anticipation, believing that the various oppressions suffered by farmers, workers, and laborers could be liberated from now on. However, reality has disappointed us. Look! The Communist Party is again killing on a large scale, and thieves have reappeared on a small scale. Let us return to Changshu. The "Merchant Four, People Six Loan" of the previous day was vigorously supported by the people. Although government funding is needed, how can it only be dependent on the haggard farmers? Recently, military grain is again being collected, and rent rice is again being pursued. Although rent rice is calculated at 60% of the normal rate, they are daydreaming and calculating it at the market price, which is actually higher than last year's "100%." We farmers are kind and cannot resist the order, so we have to endure the pain and pay the rent. We are afraid that if we delay, the "Rent Collection Office" will calculate it at 75%. I saw with my own eyes the other day that more than four thousand yuan (national currency) was paid per stone (unit of volume), which actually exceeded the value of one stone of rice. It turns out that the official price is 4,550 yuan in legal tender, and calculated at 75%, each stone of rent is 3,187.5 yuan in legal tender, plus 400 yuan for miscellaneous expenses and 400 yuan for certificate fees. The deliveryman's snack money and the local thank-you money! Alas! How can our farmers' labor of a year, with the limited autumn harvest, fill the endless desires? Especially in Changshu, the "tax collectors" wear coats and carry suitcases, acting in a grand manner and claiming to be officially appointed. They make trouble at every turn, and a group of "account managers" abuse their power and bully people. The "lackeys" also strut around and show off. This makes our farmers hate farming very much. Although this year we can barely support ourselves by selling rice to pay the rent, our parents, wives, and children will not have enough to eat at the beginning of the year! (The writer has been in this situation year after year, suffering unspeakable hardship.) If the price of rice goes up a lot, we will have to measure every grain we eat and will definitely suffer from hunger and cold. At that time, we will look at our own fields and cannot but plant them. If we do not plant them, we will lose our jobs, and if we lose our jobs, we will starve to death. So we have to endure it, hold back our tears, tighten our belts, sometimes "breathing like a cow" and sometimes "sweating like porridge." We then use human power to "draw water" and "divide the fields." The writer will again compare the cost of planting each acre of land, labor, fertilizer (about 1.6 stones of rice) and the autumn harvest (about 1.7 stones). Then it will be known that the farmers' income does not meet their expenses. If you add the rent, wouldn't they lose a lot of capital? However, the men in our village go out to work (as partners, servants, or peddlers to make a living), and farming is done entirely by women and children, so production is greatly reduced. Moreover, they often conform to this poem - "Silkworms in February spin new silk; mulberry leaves in May are newly destroyed; curing the immediate pain, cutting out the flesh of the heart." Living like this, "eating the grain of the year of the Rooster before the year of the Rabbit is over", is even more overwhelming. As one who claims to "govern the world through knowledge and cultivate the land through strength," I have also reached a dead end because I am unwilling to do things under the puppet organization. - Now I hope that the government will earnestly reduce rent, level prices, and open up sources of income. This is what is beneficial to the countryside. The grain purchased by the provincial government the other day, although a large amount of 60,000 stones, was handled by rice merchants, so there was not much direct pain, only indirect impact. Now the county government is going to handle grain, but it is focusing on the township and village chiefs, allocating it according to the land. The price is 4,500 yuan in legal tender, and a deposit of 10% is paid first. The rest is flying in the sky, I will not discuss it for the time being. I heard that the first district is handling 6,000 stones. Think about it: the towns in the city cannot produce rice. At the township chief meeting the other day, each household had to pay at least five dou (unit of volume), and some even had to pay several stones. How can our farmers afford it? It can be said with certainty that this method must be improved. Otherwise, it will definitely lead to turmoil and theft. The urgent task of "universalizing education" and "revitalizing the countryside" cannot be delayed any longer. Then there will be no room for corrupt officials to exist! The young man who is plowing and sighing, having eaten some thin porridge on the morning of the tenth day of the first month, wrote this in the cold and desolate rural under the dilapidated thatched roof.</p>
<h3>Political Consultative Conference Snippets: Zhang Shenfu Discusses "Spoils System" Jokes, Co-Discusses Huang Yanpei's "Piglet" Logic</h3>
<p>— Special dispatch from Chongqing by Pu Dejie</p>
<p>The fourth meeting of the "Political Consultative Conference" (PCC) was held at 9:00 AM on the 15th. Zhang Junli, Mo Dehui, and Ye Jianying were absent due to matters of importance. Wang Shijie and Deng Xianchao were on sick leave. Thirty-three members attended. Chairman Sun Ke announced that the secretariat had not received any proposals that could be used as a basis for discussion. He requested that everyone express their opinions on the programmatic issues. Members from various factions expressed their opinions at opportune moments. Zhang Shenfu spoke first and mentioned the People's Liberty Protection League in order to reassure the audience and let the people know that the meeting was for the benefit of the people, and not for some people to seek official positions and divide the spoils. When Wu Tiecheng spoke about the form of the program, he said that he attended a symposium last night and heard people criticize the Political Consultative Conference as a factional meeting, even a spoils-sharing meeting. He stated that it was better to have a political agreement like the parties in the United States during wartime, instead of beautifying the name with some kind of program to impose on the common people. He conveyed this to everyone for reference. After Dong Biwu of the Chinese Communist Party and Chang Naihui of the Youth Party expressed their detailed opinions, Fa Ji suggested, "Do not use harsh words like 'spoils system' in the meeting. In foreign countries, 'Spoij Syete' means a one-party dictatorship dividing spoils and titles." Regarding the opinion that it was a factional meeting, he said that the important document of the English constitution, the "Magna Carta" of 1215, was originally only an agreement between nobles and the emperor. Luo enumerated the provisions of the "Magna Carta," saying that it did not matter that outsiders said that party agreements had no legal basis, as long as they could represent the interests of the people, they could be regarded as a "Magna Carta." Chen Bulei then agreed with Zhang's opinion, saying that "spoils system," "coalition government," "secret agents," and other "harsh" terms should not be used in this harmonious meeting. Subsequently, Zhang Shenfu admitted that the members of the conference were not elected by the people, but recommended by various parties, but the parties should represent the people, so it was an indirect representation of the people. He emphasized that the will of the people was not difficult to know. Afterwards, industrialist Li Zhukang presented his economic plan for the country, farmers, and workers, saying, "The government should solve the difficulties of farmers, and industry should make people work harder." He spoke about many methods of constructing farmland irrigation and passionately appealed for the party to withdraw from factories, so that labor disputes would not remain unresolved, affecting production. By this time, it was almost one o'clock. Fu Sinian gave up his chance to speak, but Huang Yanpei stood up and loudly presented his "piglet" logic, saying, "How can the dignified power of the National Government be called spoils?" While advocating that "from today onwards, everyone must not use the word 'spoils system'," he used the phrase a few more times. Then, Wu Tiecheng stood up again and solemnly stated, "The spoils system is the opinion of outsiders. He was only telling a joke for everyone's reference." At this point, the chairman announced that the issue would be handed over to a small group for discussion. The Secretary-General reported the list of small group assignments. Wang Yunwu suggested that Fu Sinian, a non-party member nominated as a drafter of the program, be added to the second group, which everyone agreed to. As Fu was about to speak, Zhang Qun stood up, waved his briefcase, and shouted, "Isn't there not enough time! Why bother!" and adjourned the meeting. The word "spoils system" will not appear in the Consultative Conference, but in order to prevent it from appearing among the common people, the members of the conference should engrave these two words in their hearts. This is the opinion of the general public, and also the hope of the people across the country. (Night of January 15th)</p>
<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Basic Understanding That Should Be Present When Discussing the Constitutional Draft</h3>
<p>The Political Consultative Conference has had heated discussions on the draft constitution, and it is said that the differences in opinions between the various parties are quite large. As the constitution is the fundamental law of the country, it should be carefully studied. However, there are a few points worth noting in regards to the discussion of the constitutional draft: Firstly, the "May 5th" constitutional draft, drafted by the Legislative Yuan and promulgated by the National Government, is, as the name suggests, merely a draft proposal and is not absolutely unmodifiable. After the National Assembly is convened, it can certainly make necessary amendments to the draft proposal to accommodate the valuable opinions gathered from all sides. Sun Ke, President of the Legislative Yuan and representative of the government, stated at the PCC meeting, "If there are any places in the constitutional draft that need to be amended, they can certainly be accommodated," which has shown the government's frank attitude. Some people believe that the Legislative Yuan drafted the constitution before the current war, and the situation is very different from today, so it must be modified. Others say that the Legislative Yuan is a government agency and cannot represent the will of the people in drafting the constitution, so it must be amended. Still others say that the constitutional draft was drafted under a one-party dictatorship and should adopt the opinions of all parties and factions, and cannot impose the concept of one-party rule on all parties and factions. Whether these arguments are completely correct is worth paying attention to.</p>
<p>The constitution is the fundamental law of the country, and it should not change frequently due to changes in the times. If we say that our country's constitutional draft was drafted before World War II, and the current situation is different, so it must be modified, then we might as well ask, the US constitution was drafted in 1788, and has gone through many wars, so it should also be modified frequently. However, the US constitution is still largely the old thing drafted in 1788. As for the Legislative Yuan's drafting of the constitutional draft, it was originally based on Dr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings; it is not a constitution-making body, but only a body for drafting a constitutional draft, and constitution-making is the business of the National Assembly. If it is said that the concept of one party cannot be imposed on all parties, then that is also an unreasonable statement. Today's parties, including the Communist Party, have all publicly recognized the Three Principles of the People as the supreme principle of nation-building. The Three Principles of the People are no longer the private property of one party. The Legislative Yuan, based on the spirit of the Three Principles of the People, drafted the constitutional draft, and did not forcibly impose the concept of one party on all parties. All of the above cannot be regarded as reasons why the "May 5th" constitutional draft must be modified. However, as mentioned earlier, the Legislative Yuan's drafting of the "May 5th" constitutional draft, although it has been carefully studied and considered repeatedly, is still afraid that there are shortcomings. For the sake of gathering ideas and benefiting everyone, if all parties have valuable opinions, they should humbly adopt them, so that the constitutional draft can reach the realm of "supreme good," and there is no need to come up with any big reasons, as if the "May 5th constitutional draft" must be completely overthrown.</p>
<p>In the discussion of the constitutional draft, we must first have a basic understanding, that is, the "May 5th" constitutional draft is the embodiment of the spirit of the Three Principles of the People and the Five-Power Constitution, and the Three Principles of the People are the supreme principle of our nation-building, and have been recognized by all parties. Therefore, the discussion and amendment of the constitutional draft should be based on the premise of not going beyond the spirit of the Three Principles of the People and the Five-Power Constitution evolved from the Three Principles of the People. Any amendment that can make the constitutional draft more perfect, and at the same time better promote the spirit of the Three Principles of the People and the Five-Power Constitution, can be adopted as the basis for amendment. When we talk about the National Assembly, we will say: "Today, the members of the PCC are gathered in the capital. Do not think that you are reforming the law or carrying out a political revolution that is bleeding or preparing to bleed. Rather, it is under the publicly recognized leadership of the Kuomintang and under the supreme principle of adhering to the Three Principles of the People for nation-building, on the basis of the political system established by the Kuomintang, frank and public consultation and negotiation on certain current political issues are carried out, seeking further coordination after discussion." We must first have this basic understanding, and then study the constitutional draft, so that we can proceed calmly and achieve the effect of striving for perfection.</p>
<p>The Three Principles of the People has its own political system, and this system should be expressed in the Five-Power Constitution. The formation of this political system is the result of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's years of research and revolutionary experience. The "May 5th constitutional draft" is a constitutional draft produced by the "Five-Power Constitution" theory. It does not adopt the representative system and parliamentary politics popular in Europe and the United States in their entirety, but extracts the essence of Western European democratic politics, and integrates it with our country's inherent excellent traditions, creating a political system unique to the Three Principles of the People. In addition to political power, there is also the power of governance. Under the power of governance, in addition to the three powers of legislation, administration, and judiciary, there are also the two powers of supervision and examination. This is a new political attempt, and we should cherish this attempt very much. Western political scholars, limited by their own political experience, have failed to make a detached and objective review of the political system that the Three Principles of the People wants to establish, which is understandable, but we Chinese should liberate ourselves from the political prejudices of Westerners. Because the power of the five branches is a new invention in politics, and there are no established rules in Western Europe to follow, this has already been mentioned in Dr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings. Therefore, if we only know how to follow the representative system of Western Europe, or the "Soviet" political system established in the Soviet Union, and insist on comparing it with the political system that the Three Principles of the People wants to establish, then it can really be said to be irrelevant, just like the American law PhD who studied in the United States thirty years ago said to Dr. Sun Yat-sen that he "only knew about the separation of three powers, and never heard of the five-power constitution," which is laughable.</p>
<p>Some people said a few days ago: "The powers of the National Assembly could be exercised by the Legislative Yuan, why is there a need for such a huge organization?" Others said: "The Legislative Yuan can be used as the lower house, and the Control Yuan as the upper house, and the powers of the two-house system of various countries can be used. The names of the two houses remain the same, but the powers are expanded. There is no need for the name of the congress, but the reality of the congress." We listened, and could only admire the death-defying skills of political commentators. We believe that if the Three Principles of the People has shortcomings, these shortcomings are not in the political system it wants to establish. The political system that the Three Principles of the People wants to establish has a consistent system, and the links within it are strict, like a large building, and no brick or stone can be removed or arbitrarily patched. For example, the National Assembly and the Legislative Yuan are clearly two different things. The former is the body that monopolizes "political power," and the latter is part of the five "governing powers." Under the system of the Three Principles of the People and the Five-Power Constitution, the series are clearly defined, so how can they be mixed up? To be honest, if the members of the PCC are determined to overthrow Dr. Sun Yat-sen's precious theory of "separation of functions," and want to abolish Dr. Sun Yat-sen's proposition of the five branches of government standing side by side, then why not simply and boldly overthrow and abolish it, and instead want to steal the sky and change the sun, move flowers and connect trees, pretending to have the "tiger skin" of the Five-Power Constitution, and secretly attacking the "donkey body" of parliamentary politics, to deceive others and deceive themselves? If Dr. Sun Yat-sen knew in the afterlife that the theory of "separation of powers and abilities," which is the essence of the "Five-Power Constitution" spirit, was discarded like worn-out shoes by some politicians who only read Western books, and that those who believe in Dr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings also turned a blind eye, I really don't know how sad he would be!</p>

<p>(Reported by this newspaper) The municipal government authorities, in view of the frequent labor disputes recently and the numerous agencies involved in mediation, which in fact have not achieved satisfactory results, have decided that in the future, any labor disputes should preferably be resolved through self-coordination. If it is necessary to apply to agencies at all levels for mediation, in order to unify procedures and comply with administrative laws and regulations, the agencies must submit a document to the Social Affairs Bureau for application or registration. In the future, when similar events occur again, the Social Affairs Bureau can invite the agency to participate in mediation in order to achieve practical results.</p>
<p>Electric Workers Propose Conditions: The Shanghai Electric Power Company's labor dispute has been mediated by the authorities many times, but it has not yet been resolved. Recently, when the company increased salaries at the end of the year, it failed to do so according to the length of service and the standards of work attendance. Some received more than 200 yuan, while others received only one and a half yuan, which caused dissatisfaction among the employees. The union raised the matter, but there were no results, and the company fired ten union directors. It is also rumored that a large number of workers will be suspended, causing panic among all workers. The employees of the Nanjing Road Main Company and the Fielun Road Distribution Station went to the Yangshupu Power Plant in formation yesterday morning to attend a general meeting and decided to propose eleven conditions to the company, demanding that the company agree to all of them. Otherwise, all 2,800 workers will not leave the factory. Workers in the electricity sector organized a protection team to guard various locations. However, the union declared that it would abide by the intentions of the authorities and not cut off the power. As of last night, there was no news of a resolution. When the factory workers gathered at 3:00 PM yesterday, the company invited a large police detachment with three machine guns to enter the factory to suppress them. However, a company of soldiers was already stationed at the factory for protection, and the police had not notified them in advance, so they could not enter the factory. After negotiations between the responsible officers of the military and police, and after the union telegraphed the party and government agencies to guarantee that the power would not be cut off, the police were ordered to withdraw.</p>
<p>Department Store Employees Slow Down Work: All employees of the city's six major department stores, Wing On, Sincere, Sun Sun, The Sun, China National Goods, and Xunhua, have repeatedly requested improved treatment, but have not been allowed by the company. The employees sent representatives to the Social Affairs Bureau to petition the day before yesterday, but there were no results. Yesterday, from 2:00 PM, they slowed down work for three hours, and business resumed as usual after 5:00 PM. The labor side declared that if the company cannot provide a satisfactory response, they will slow down work for three hours every day.</p>
<p>Barber Workers Strike Yesterday Morning: At about 8:00 AM yesterday, more than 20 barbershops in the Central District began to strike. By the afternoon, the number had increased to more than 100. The workers demanded that the split of the income between the workers and the owners be increased from 40/60 to 35/65, and that the night porridge be changed to night meals. The authorities have begun mediation.</p>

<p>The First Inspection Group of the Supervisory Yuan recently made three suggestions to the central government: (1) The authorized agencies handling traitor cases should strictly abide by the provisions of Articles 2 and 3 of the Regulations on Punishing Traitors. (2) Clear and unified implementation procedures and investigation procedures should be specified, and the implementation rules should be strictly observed. Before arresting criminals or sealing property, a detailed investigation of the evidence must be conducted to ensure its accuracy before implementation. (3) If the investigation is found to be false and there is indeed malicious intent or other motives, the case should be sent to the court for severe punishment in accordance with Article 7 of the Regulations on Punishing Traitors.</p>

<h3>Large Quantities of Concealed Materials Seized: To Be Sold at Discounted Prices or Through Bidding; Artificial Silk Alone Worth 20 Billion Yuan</h3>
<p>The Enemy and Puppet Property Handling Bureau of the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui Districts has been in operation for more than two months since the establishment of the investigation and seizure team in mid-November last year. The enemy and puppet concealed properties and materials seized through tipoffs from various parties or by the team itself are quite large in number. The recent acquisitions are even more numerous, and the value is astonishing.</p>
<p>Enemy and Puppet Materials Worth Hundreds of Millions: For example, the team recently seized a large number of enemy and puppet materials in three warehouses in Tianzhu Church, Father King Road, and Jiazhiyi Road, with an estimated value of more than 834.4 million yuan. Among the important materials are more than 2,770 pieces of artificial silk fabrics and silk fabrics, more than 990 pieces of cotton cloth, more than 1,059 pieces of cotton fabrics, more than 1,400 pieces of cotton yarn, more than 100 pieces of wool, more than 800 cans of kerosene and oil, and more than 5,000 pieces of other glass sundries. In addition, three batches of porcelain were seized in Santai Road, Minhang Road, and Hongkou, and were piled in five rooms. More than 500 boxes were estimated to be worth about 25.5 million yuan. One hundred and twelve buildings of the Nitto Koshi Land Credit Association were seized on Wusong Road. Twenty-one buildings on Ladu Road and Lecun Road were seized, all of which are of great value. In addition, there are machinery, food, hardware, daily necessities, and other materials, with many types, reportedly more than 200 types, which will be sold at discounted prices, through bidding, or by auction, according to their nature.</p>
<p>Huge Quantities of Cotton Yarn and Cloth: In addition, the quantity of cotton yarn and cloth stored in the Puppet China Japan Trade Federation and enemy yarn factories received by the Bureau of Optical Restoration Road is extremely large, and the value is impossible to estimate. Among them, artificial silk alone is estimated to be more than 20,000 boxes, with a market value of about 20 billion yuan. The review meeting decided yesterday to sell this artificial silk in batches. To meet the current urgent needs of various manufacturers, it was decided to allocate 1,500 boxes for supply first. At the same time, the Handling Bureau will investigate the actual needs of various factories in order to verify and allocate them in installments. It is reported that the allocation work will be carried out by representatives from the Handling Bureau, the Ministry of Economic Affairs, the China Textile Company, the China Silk Company, and the Silk Weaving Factory Association to form a joint committee, and the actual sales procedures will be handled by the China Textile Company on behalf of the committee.</p>

<h3>Commemorating the January 28th Incident: The 88th Division Holds Exercises; Division Commander Hu Jiaji Hosts Reporters Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Third Front Army Headquarters Office in Shanghai, and the residence of 88th Division Commander Hu Jiaji, will hold exercises on this day in the city center where the January 28th Incident war broke out, in commemoration of the incident. At that time, invitations will be sent to military and government leaders of this city and Chinese and foreign journalists to observe.</p>
<p>Reporting on the Division's Combat Achievements: Division Commander Hu Jiaji hosted reporters from various newspapers in the city at the division headquarters in Jiangwan at 3:00 PM yesterday, with over 40 people attending. Division Commander Hu reported that the division failed to fulfill its responsibilities in the Jinghu Road area during the early stages of the War of Resistance, expressing his regret. He will encourage officers and soldiers to serve the people of Jinghu Road in the future, and at the same time, he hopes that the local elders will regard the officers and soldiers as their own children and cooperate with each other. The division has been established for 18 years. After the August 13th Incident, it was transferred to Nanjing and later participated in the defense battles on the outskirts of Wuhan. Subsequently, it firmly defended the Nujiang River, counterattacked Longling, captured Zhefang, and recovered Wan 町, repeatedly achieving extraordinary feats. On June 21st last year, the National Government specially awarded a silk banner to commend the division for its功 in capturing Longling.</p>
<p>Distributed in the Suburbs of Songhu: Currently, the 88th Division troops are distributed in more than ten locations in the urban suburbs of this city, including Baoshan, Wusong, and Longhua. The Jiangwan city center sports field is also stationed by the division's regimental headquarters. The internal facilities are very neat and tidy, and the equipment is the latest weaponry.</p>
<h3>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce Cables Authorities Requesting Improvement of Land Registration Procedures; Simplification and Reduction of Fees Should Be the Principle</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday sent cables to the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Finance, and the Land Administration Department of the Executive Yuan, requesting improvements to the land registration procedures in this city and a reduction in fees. "The gist is, Shanghai is the financial center of the country, and land titles represent a large portion of the city's wealth and are the largest chips for financial circulation. If the registration procedures are slow and the tax burden is too heavy, these chips will be frozen and unable to circulate, and the industry will fall into a state of stagnation and collapse. The disastrous drop in real estate prices and the decline in the market after 1932 can serve as a profound lesson. Moreover, this city has just been recovered, and the currency system has changed, which has greatly affected the financial resources of the people. The class of stagnant real estate, especially real estate companies, is particularly affected. If they are ordered to pay excessive cash, their assets will not be enough to cover the expenses, and bankruptcy will follow. This impact should be taken into consideration. In particular, local authorities should strictly abide by the principle of not changing laws and regulations when handling government affairs, so that the previous and subsequent government orders do not conflict, which is enough to make the people jointly abide by them. Based on the above reasons, the current registration methods of the Land Administration Department have been repeatedly invited to the Industrial and Commercial Laws and Regulations Committee, and experts have been gathered to conduct detailed research. The research and suggestions are as follows: (1) All items should be determined as much as possible in accordance with the law, and the levy rate should not be increased under the pretext of increasing municipal financial revenue. (2) The registration deadline is approaching, please approve an extension. (3) The registration procedures should be agile and convenient in principle. (4) The standard for estimating land prices should be changed. (5) Multiple plots of land should be exempt from the fee increase. We hope that you will review and adopt them one by one."</p>

Once the inspection is completed and the nationality certificate is obtained, it will set sail, generally sailing to the Northern Seas first, and then to the Southern Seas. As the Yangtze River's water level continues to recede, the shipping industry received a report from Hankou yesterday stating that the Hankou River's water level is only 3.7 feet, making navigation extremely difficult. It is reported that no fewer than 30,000 to 40,000 passengers are stranded in Yichang heading downstream. The association is considering transferring smaller ships upstream. It is reported that the "Hongda" ship left port this morning, and the "Jiangchang" ship will leave Shanghai tomorrow to head upstream, both heading to Hankou to serve.</p>

<h3>Stabilizing Rice Prices in This City: Four Measures Are Defined</h3>
<p>Shanghai Municipal Grain Administration Special Envoy Yang Xizhi stated: "The main reasons for the recent rise in rice prices are: [1] Increased sales due to the approaching New Year; [2] Increased sales due to out-of-town merchants purchasing for re-export. Yesterday, Minister Xu Kan came to Shanghai to investigate the actual situation. After drafting measures to stabilize grain prices, they were submitted to President Song for approval and implementation. The main measures to stabilize grain prices are: [1] All rice merchants engaged in re-export in Shanghai should purchase rice in designated producing areas and are not allowed to directly purchase and transport it in the Shanghai market. Orders have been issued to comply with this. [2] Dredging the grain sources and supporting grain merchants. [3] A large amount of rice will be transported to Shanghai from the producing areas.

<h3>Three Minor Suggestions</h3>
<p>-- Hangzhou · Jiang Yuqing</p>
<p>(1) In Chongqing, whenever the national flag is raised or lowered at the spiritual fortresses, national music must be played, which invigorates the spirit. I believe that in a city as large as Shanghai, this should not be lacking. I now propose that in the circular area at the intersection of Xizang Road and Racecourse Road, a flagpole should be erected in the middle. Every morning and evening, the municipal government should send police officers to play national music and perform the national flag raising and lowering ceremony at the same time. This is a small detail, but it is also a way to educate the public.</p>
<p>(2) According to reports, the Municipal Bureau of Education has a compromise solution for private school fees, which will only increase the burden on parents. Standing in the position of a parent, I would also like to propose a compromise solution: pay fees on a monthly basis. I believe that schools use tuition fees as operating expenses, which are of course paid on a monthly basis. Then students can also pay fees on a monthly basis. This solution is beneficial to parents, and it seems that it is harmless and feasible for schools.</p>
<p>(3) It is reported that the iron gate connecting Shanghai and Nanshi has been removed, which is to eliminate the legacy of the "concession." However, Shanghai is a whole, and everything should be uniform. For example, the use of 110 volts by the French Electricity Company and 220 volts by the American Electricity Company should not be allowed in a single city. I think the municipal authorities should find a way to improve this, so as to show uniformity.</p>
<p>(Editor's Note) The three suggestions made by Mr. Jiang seem ordinary, but they are actually very meaningful. I hope that the responsible officials of the Municipal Police Bureau, the Bureau of Education, and the Bureau of Public Utilities will implement them as soon as possible to live up to the expectations of the readers.</p>
<h3>Report on Donations to the Education Loan Fund</h3>

<h3>Spot Transactions Are Few; Gold Market Rises Weakly; US Dollars and Hong Kong Dollars Also Rise</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the gold market was stimulated by the sharp rise in northern gold prices, but because of the tight silver supply in the Stock Exchange Building, major players mostly stayed on the sidelines. At the end of the year, various parties were also reluctant to engage in many activities. Therefore, although it rose, it was still mediocre. In the early morning, it rose slightly to 895,000, with supply exceeding demand. Under the scramble to buy, it broke through the 900,000 mark and rose to 917,000. At this time, the spread for arbitrage of US dollars had widened to 625 yuan per ten taels, causing arbitrage sellers to come out and the price to fall back. The process after entering was mediocre, hovering around 910,000. Until noon, there was no dramatic change. In the afternoon, there were not many spot transactions. When tomorrow's delivery was opened, it started to pick up slightly. Guangdong merchants aggressively took in a large number of tomorrow's delivery transactions, and people's hearts began to be stimulated. Futures rose to 936,000, and as a result, the actual delivery rose by 15,000 compared to the previous closing. Decorative gold was listed at 100,000, silver bullion at 800 yuan, and silver dollars around 475 yuan. The unofficial interest rates were still tight, with interest rates of about 10% to 13%.</p>
<p>The US dollar market remained mediocre. Although the gold market rose, the US dollar was limited in its rise due to the dumping of physical goods by money exchange businesses. Arbitrage traders came in slightly to absorb the supply, and the price fell from 1,478 yuan to around 1,465 yuan. There were few changes in the middle. In the afternoon, due to the rise in gold futures, the price hovered at 1,480 yuan at the end, resulting in a rebound of 32 yuan. There was gradual arbitrage buying of Hong Kong dollars. Old Hong Kong dollars rebounded by 5 yuan, and although there was a gradual increase in interest in new Hong Kong dollars, there was a lack of sustained momentum. As a result, the price continued to rise by 2 yuan.</p>
<h3>Major Players Are Coming Out; Chinese Stocks Are Recovering</h3>

<h3>The Confusion of Hong Kong's Monetary System: Authorities Feel Quite Baffled</h3>
<p>(Reuters, Hong Kong, 23rd) The confusion of Hong Kong's monetary system is the most baffling problem for the administrative authorities. Although it is not considered serious at present due to the authorities' promulgation of the suspension of exchange order, this matter must be resolved before the resumption of pre-war trade. During the effective period of the suspension order, old depositors before the Pearl Harbor incident can only withdraw HK$200 per month. There is no solution for pre-war commercial accounts and local stock transactions. Although the Hong Kong dollar is supported by the pound and the US dollar, it has no stable purchasing power. Hong Kong has close ties with China, and the stability of China's politics and finance should help stabilize the Hong Kong dollar. In recent weeks, the Hong Kong dollar has fluctuated with the black market for legal tender and the US dollar. The revival of overseas remittances is also a reason for the depreciation. Superficially, the currency does not seem to depreciate due to needs, but because recipients of remittances do not have normal investment channels, they mostly purchase gold bars and goods, which reduces the purchasing power of the Hong Kong dollar. The inflow of funds is a good phenomenon, but if it is not brought into line, it is enough to induce currency inflation. It is expected that the confusion will be more obvious after the suspension of exchange order is lifted. Recently, some banks have notified those who have made pledges that pledges settled with the Japanese and Tai clearance agents in the past cannot be recognized, and the banks still retain their mortgage rights. The destruction of document records after the Japanese invasion will make it impossible for major import and export companies to sort out their debts and obligations. Furthermore, regarding the issuance of Hong Kong banknotes, at the beginning of the Japanese occupation, the directors of the banks that issued banknotes had to issue a large number of new banknotes under the threat of force. These banknotes have not yet been recognized by the issuing banks, at least for the time being. However, there are informal quotations in Shanghai. Whether these banknotes can be exchanged at a certain exchange rate in the future, the authorities have not given any instructions. The Hong Kong government is making every effort to stabilize finance. The resumption of the stock exchange can absorb a large amount of floating capital and guide it into the right track of investment in enterprises and real estate.</p>

<h3>Border Education After the War: Continuous Improvement of Textbooks in Various Leagues and Banners; Border Schools Will Re-establish in Beijing</h3>
<p>(Our Newspaper, Nanjing Special Dispatch) Regarding border education, the Mongolian and Tibetan Education Department of the Ministry of Education was in charge before the war. During the Anti-Japanese War, this education was still actively carried out. Now, at the time of repatriation, it is heard that Nanjing is planning to set up a Border Education Center to prepare for research and compile border writing work (such as Chinese translation comparison texts and dictionaries for Mongolian, Hui, Tibetan, etc.) to assist in the development of border education. At the same time, the Mongolian and Tibetan Department of the Ministry of Education is still continuing to improve the textbooks used in schools in various leagues and banners on the border, in addition to those that have already been published. It is also heard that the Mongolian and Tibetan School, formerly established in Xiaozhuang Central Political School in Nanjing before the war, has long been renamed the Border School and has come to Beijing to try to re-establish.

<h3>Paying Attention to Girls' Education Amidst the Sounds of Zhejiang's Repatriation</h3>
<p>(Our Newspaper, Hangzhou) Xu, the Director of the Education Department of Zhejiang Province, is very concerned about the education work after this repatriation. As for the repatriation of girls' education, the department originally planned in December of the 33rd year of the Republic (1944) to stipulate that the Provincial Hangzhou Girls' Middle School should be re-established in Hangzhou in the semester following repatriation. However, because the central government approved the budget for Zhejiang Province in the 35th year of the Republic (1946) according to the large numbers in the previous year's budget, the education funds of the province in the 35th year of the Republic (1946) can only barely maintain the existing business and cannot be restored immediately. In order to thoroughly implement the repatriation plan, Director Xu has compiled another repatriation expenditure budget and submitted it to the provincial government for compilation and to the central government for approval. Once approved, the Provincial Hangzhou Girls' Middle School can be restored. At the same time, in the repatriation expenditure budget, Director Xu not only seeks to restore the Provincial Hangzhou Girls' Middle School, but also plans to add two more provincial girls' middle schools and two girls' normal schools, distributed in eastern Zhejiang, hoping to popularize girls' education in Zhejiang.

<h3>Zhejiang Province Conducts General Registration of Elementary School Teachers; Education Department Sets a Five-Month Deadline for Completion</h3>
<p>(Our Newspaper, Hangzhou) The Education Department of Zhejiang Province issued the detailed rules for the implementation of the general registration and inspection of elementary school teachers to all cities and counties for compliance and implementation, and stipulated that a qualification review committee for elementary school teachers should be established for registration and qualification review.

<h3>Salaries of Elementary and Secondary School Teachers in Beijing Adjusted</h3>
<p>Municipal Schools Increase Salaries Starting in January; Increased Tuition Fees of Private Schools Adjust Salaries</p>
<p>(Our Newspaper, Nanjing Special Dispatch) Before the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, the salaries of elementary and secondary school teachers in Nanjing were extremely meager, barely enough to make a living. After the repatriation of the Social Affairs Bureau of the Nanjing Municipal Government after the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, it immediately began to rectify the teaching staff. In mid-October of last year, it held an examination for elementary and secondary school teachers, with approximately 2,000 registered. In late November, the results of the examination were announced, and qualified teachers were admitted. The middle school section had fewer than 200 people, and the elementary school section had more than 700 people. Most of the principals of elementary and secondary schools were changed, and a few were retained and reappointed. Among the teachers and staff of various schools, those who had participated in the examination and were qualified were either retained in their original schools or transferred. Those who were not qualified were eliminated. After employing qualified teachers, the living salaries of teachers and staff were also gradually increased. It is learned that the salary for October was calculated by multiplying the original basic salary by 40 times, plus a living allowance of 5,000 yuan and a rice loan of 3,000 yuan. Therefore, the highest salary for elementary school teachers was no more than 12,000 to 13,000 yuan, and the highest salary for middle school teachers was no more than 16,000 to 17,000 yuan. In November, the "Provisional Standards for the Salaries of Elementary and Secondary School Teachers and Staff in Beijing" were revised. The basic salary of middle school teachers and staff was determined based on the depth of academic qualifications and experience. The basic salary of elementary school teachers and staff was determined based on the number of grades and the comparison of the courses they taught. For example, the highest basic salary for middle school principals was 360 yuan, and the lowest basic salary for vocational teachers was 80 yuan. The highest basic salary for elementary school principals was 240 yuan, and the lowest basic salary for ordinary vocational teachers was 60 yuan. It was calculated by multiplying by 60 times, plus a living allowance of 7,000 yuan and a rice loan of 6,500 yuan (changed to 7,000 yuan in December). Therefore, the highest salary for middle school teachers was more than 20,000 yuan, and the lowest salary for elementary school teachers was more than 16,000 yuan. Starting from January of this year, the "Standard for the Salaries of Public Teachers and Staff Revised by the Executive Yuan" will be followed, and the calculation will be based on multiplying the basic salary by 80 times, plus a living allowance of 28,000 yuan. In this way, the lowest salary for middle school staff will be more than 35,000 yuan, the lowest salary for teachers will be more than 40,000 yuan, and the lowest salary for elementary school principals and head teachers will be more than 35,000 yuan, and the highest can reach more than 40,000 yuan, which is higher than before, and the living can be maintained. It is also heard that after the winter vacation, private middle schools will increase tuition fees. The tuition fee for junior high school will be between 10,000 and 12,000 yuan, and the tuition fee for senior high school will be between 13,000 and 15,000 yuan. Therefore, with this injection, the salaries of teachers in private schools can also be increased to between 20,000 and 35,000 yuan. (Fool)</p>

<h3>Letter of Clarification</h3>
<p>To the editor: The letter of clarification published by the Mingxing Perfume Factory in your newspaper on January 20, 35th year of the Republic (1946) is entirely fictitious and not factual. The ownership of our school building has changed hands as many as eight times, resulting in no one to receive the rent. After Zhou Bangjun of Mingxing Perfume Factory purchased the house, he was first threatened by several members of the Special Higher Division of the police bureau, and then commissioned the enemy lawyer Rong Muzhao Chang and the enemy education director Ueno to send letters of intimidation, forcing us to move out. In the end, the Zhongzhina Zhendian Co., Ltd. notified us to take over the disputed property. The facts are all there, and the evidence is conclusive. During the enemy and puppet period, we were harassed repeatedly and suffered greatly. We refused to accept the rent, and there are letters to prove it. The deposit in the court was entirely due to the environment. The so-called rejection by Japanese teachers is purely a fabricated slander after the fact. We are deeply afraid of confusing the public, so we specially request that you correct the facts as they have occurred. This is written by Jingqi, Principal of the Zhong Women's National Elementary School.</p>

<p>Free Talk Special Issue on Women and Family</p>
<h3>Introductory Remarks</h3>
<p>— Editor</p>
<p>Starting today, "Free Talk" will be dedicated to publishing articles on women and family every Thursday. At the time of launch, it seems that we should talk about our purpose.</p>
<p>The women's movement has not had a long history in China, but thanks to the efforts of all parties, it has achieved considerable success. In the future, we should refer to the domestic and international situation and strive for further progress. Because in the future, no one can abandon his responsibility to the country and society, and there are many things that require the efforts of the women's community.</p>
<p>Regarding the family, from self to family to clan, it was originally the procedure for building a country in China throughout the ages. Now, when we are starting to build a country, we can devote ourselves to the work of regulating the family, because the work of regulating the family must start with self-cultivation, and extend to the way of governing the family. If Chinese families can get on the right track, every Chinese person will be an excellent citizen; every society in China will be perfect and healthy; so that the work of building a country can be done with half the effort.</p>
<p>The articles published in this journal strive to suit the trend of the times, and also strive to adapt to the national conditions. Because if it suits the trend of the times but does not adapt to the national conditions, it will inevitably become empty talk on paper; if it adapts to the national conditions but does not suit the trend of the times, it will inevitably stick to the old ways. At the beginning of this publication, we sincerely hope that all sectors will give criticism and readers will give correction.</p>
<p>Children</p>
<h3>Preventing Children's Inferiority Complex</h3>
<p>— Yang Tongfang</p>
<p>To hope to succeed in anything, the first thing is to have a strong self-confidence. A person without self-confidence, feeling that he is not as good as others in anything, will be discouraged by disappointment and dare not try any work. Anyone without self-confidence will definitely not face reality and will not have the courage and determination to create any career.</p>
<p>The lack of self-confidence will lead to a feeling of inferiority. The formation of an inferiority complex not only affects one's own career, but also has the danger of becoming a psychological aberration. Many mental patients initially start with a sense of inferiority. Originally, everyone has a tendency for "self-expression," and there is no such thing as an inferiority complex. But why do some people have a feeling of inferiority? Most failures easily make people feel frustrated and disheartened, and eventually develop an inferiority complex. It is common for parents not to understand their children's interests and abilities, and to place their hopes too high. The results shown by their children often differ greatly from their parents' hopes. Because children are hit by failure, they lose their self-confidence and develop an inferiority complex. Therefore, the stimulation of success can often encourage children's efforts, and the reaction of failure often causes a feeling of inferiority. Some parents are too doting on their children and do not allow them to feel any difficulties at ordinary times. They do not teach their children to do anything independently. Even ordinary homework practice is done by their parents. This develops an incorrect feeling in children, that is, "everything is easy to succeed." They never know the true meaning of "success." When their children leave their parents and there is no one to help them, they often feel frustrated and disheartened due to failure, to the point of doubting themselves. The bad mentality of timidity and cowardice is formed under such circumstances, and the inferiority complex naturally arises.</p>
<p>We also often see that some teachers, who think they are serious about mathematics, give children overly difficult homework, not understanding the impact of "success" on psychology. Children often encounter failure and rarely have the opportunity to gain the satisfaction of "success." These teachers believe that the more students who fail in a class, the more it shows that they are serious about mathematics and not careless. They do not know that the more students who fail in a class, the more inferiority complexes are formed. Because children all have a competitive psychology of "self-expression," failing, repeating a grade, or being punished has a great impact on their psychology. They feel ashamed and humiliated even if they have some small failures.</p>
<p>Professor Buting said, "Children who fail in school are the backups for mental hospitals." We must pay attention to this widespread and serious problem, and try to give children more opportunities to succeed, and do not injure their enterprising and upward-looking hearts. We must make the work that children do be consistent with their actual abilities, age, and interests, and do not wantonly destroy their innocent, lively, brave, and competitive nature!</p>
<p>Parents and teachers should encourage and guide children to engage in learning, and should not easily scold or punish them, let alone treat them with contempt. Frequent or easy implementation of punishments does not necessarily have an educational effect. It only increases their resistant attitude of not approaching or trusting their parents or teachers. Moreover, their self-esteem is lost, and they will not work harder or be more attentive in the future, and even no matter how much they are persuaded, it will not work. We must deeply understand that blame, sarcasm, and contempt only cause children to feel frustrated, disappointed, and inferior.</p>
<p>An excellent parent and teacher can understand the personality and psychology of children, avoid all stimuli that can develop an inferiority complex, and often guide children to the road to success. A reasonable educational method is based on the scientific research methods of children's psychology, and trains children's adaptability with a sympathetic attitude. It educates and guides children according to the normal state of children's physical and mental development.</p>
<p>We should certainly try to give children more opportunities to succeed, so that they will be less likely to be hit by failure, so as not to develop an inferiority complex. But we should not let children always be in a "smooth" environment without feeling any difficulties. A person cannot completely avoid failure in his life. In some cases, failure is precisely the stimulus for success. It is very important to let children know how to work harder because of failure and to overcome difficulties by striving hard because of failure. Parents and teachers should enable children to learn in practical work based on the principle of spontaneous activity, and only be in a guiding and encouraging position, without having to do everything for them.</p>
<p>It is also very important to find ways to help children develop the courage to do things and learn. To prevent the occurrence of feelings of inferiority and to establish self-confidence, if parents find that their children have physical or mental defects, they should try their best to develop their strengths and make positive and reasonable compensation.</p>
<p>We need the embrace of a loving mother to deal with children who already have a sense of inferiority. We also need to study the causes of the inferiority complex using the diagnostic methods of doctors. Children's personalities must be respected in any way. Their fragile hearts cannot withstand the humiliation and contempt of adults. We should always think more for them. If we can maintain a sense of self-esteem for them, we should maintain a sense of self-esteem for them. I think that if adults can comfort the hearts of children and warm the hearts of children with a sympathetic, kind, sincere, and genuine attitude, then they will definitely work bravely and learn earnestly, and will never develop an inferior and cowardly mentality.</p>

<h3>Introducing the Nursing Profession</h3>
<p>— Xue Lin</p>
<p>Our nation's victory in the War of Resistance was a comprehensive victory achieved alongside the entire Allied nations. Among the Allied nations, our country was one of the four or five major powers. We are one of the five permanent members of the United Nations. Post-war, as our international standing rises, so does our responsibility to the world. But how do we become a strong nation, and how do we fulfill our responsibilities? We should strive to study the situation in all aspects. I will now only talk about one aspect, related to my own profession. A nation's strength lies entirely in the hard work of each of its citizens. If the people are not physically healthy, how can they work hard, how can they produce? How can they invigorate their spirits to work diligently? Without a strong body, one can only consume, and there is no way to talk about production. Therefore, the progress of a nation is closely related to medicine. Strong nations must have developed medicine. Look at countries like Britain and America, and you can see the importance of medicine. Facts have already told us that we can no longer ignore it. To make the country advance, to seek happiness for mankind, we must pay attention to our issue—health. Especially after the war, those who survived endured indescribable hardships, economic bankruptcy, malnutrition, and mental trauma. How can we restore everyone to a normal state to participate in the work of reconstruction? This is the current urgent task. Governments of various countries and our government attach great importance to this issue, and there are plans to seek reforms. The newspapers have published the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration's plans for medicine, which is to open 655 hospitals of various sizes, requiring a particularly large number of nursing staff. Therefore, I am here to discuss the nursing profession, so that people in the community can understand its true nature and give it their support and cooperation. The nursing profession is a social one, sacrificing oneself for the happiness of the masses. The scope of contact and work is very broad, treating people of all classes, men, women, old, young, rich, and poor, equally, providing them with the best possible care so that they can recover their health as soon as possible, and instilling them with general health knowledge so that everyone can prevent diseases and maintain health.</p>
<p>The nursing profession is a profession in which one must handle life's most important problems. In addition to receiving specialized training and education, nurses should have a noble character and recognize the spirit of service. Love is the main driving force of a nurse, like an atomic bomb, vast and powerful, serving others regardless of everything.</p>
<p>The nursing profession is a science and is advancing with the times. Various nursing techniques must apply scientific principles to ensure safe implementation and achieve appropriate or desired results. Science is advancing, and there are often new inventions. Science is the foundation of medicine and nursing. Therefore, they advance in tandem and have a very close relationship.</p>
<p>The nursing profession can be said to be a women's profession, because her character is gentle and considerate, which men cannot compare. Now is the time of our country's construction, and there are many places where men are needed. Isn't it good that we women can have a profession to promote our nature and fulfill our duty as citizens?</p>
<p>Currently, some nurses in society are not representative of the profession. On the one hand, it is because they do not have a real understanding of the nursing profession, but think of it as a way to make a living, so they do not have the spirit of service. On the other hand, it is because their general knowledge is too shallow, and they have not received adequate vocational training and education. As a result, the general public despises the nursing profession, so some young women are unwilling to choose this great profession of serving humanity. The number and quality of nurses in our country are not sufficient to meet our country's needs. I hope that this brief introduction can give the community a considerable understanding of the profession, and also arouse young women's interest in the profession, and join the nursing profession to strengthen our forces. This would allow them to make a greater contribution to our country's reconstruction, and at the same time make our country worthy of being one of the five major powers among the Allied nations.</p>
<p>Every morning, nurses in the nursery prepare milk according to each child's individual needs, using sterile methods, for their use throughout the day.</p>

<h3>Eliminating Bad Habits at the Start of the New Year</h3>
<p>— Li</p>
<p>Soon we will encounter the Lunar New Year again. At this time, we can engage in a review. There are several bad habits that can be eliminated. We may as well remove meaningless actions and replace them with meaningful measures.</p>
<p>For example, because parents love their children, they give them so-called "lucky money" at the beginning of the year. After the children receive it, they either buy some nonsensical things or buy a lot of unsanitary food. We don't give them anything meaningful, such as books. If we use toys, then we should choose toys with educational significance. If we use candy, then we should choose high-quality and clean candy.</p>
<p>When we meet friends and relatives, we usually have to say "Congratulations on getting rich." In fact, getting rich is not the most important thing in life, and it seems that we can change to more meaningful congratulatory words.</p>
<p>Many superstitious actions, such as thanking the gods for the year and welcoming the god of wealth, can also be eliminated, because these actions only waste money and actually have no benefit.</p>
<p>The life we want to live now is a simple and clean life, no longer a hypocritical and corrupt life.</p>

<h3>Assisting in the Completion of the Baojia System</h3>
<p>— Suwen</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Government has announced that from the 15th of this month, the entire city will simultaneously reorganize the Baojia system and check the household registration. This action, as explained in the municipal government's announcement, is the basic-level organization of local self-government. Whether it is sound or not is related to the success or failure of national construction, which is extremely important.</p>
<p>Every one of our families should use great sincerity to assist in the completion of the Baojia system. Many people are unwilling to fill out the forms according to the real situation in order to avoid responsibility. In fact, this is unnecessary, because China is moving towards democracy. If we individuals want to get the protection of the country, we must ask ourselves what work we have done for the country. If we cooperate with the government's measures, we can get the rights we deserve.</p>
<p>At the same time, as a modern citizen, we can no longer adopt the attitude of "sweeping only the snow in front of our own door." We must do our best to assist in social affairs.</p>
<p>The Baojia system is quite related to the work of managing the family. We also hope that the government can use the Baojia system to create statistics and determine the direction of policy implementation.</p>
<p>For example, using the Baojia system, we can investigate how many illiterate people there are in Shanghai, and then we can start to work on how to eliminate illiteracy within the prescribed time limit.</p>
<p>In fact, the Baojia system can be said to be a general hub between the government and the people, so assisting in the completion of the Baojia system can be said to be the duty of everyone.</p>
<p>Toys</p>
<h3>Homemade Toys</h3>
<p>— Xiao Shufang</p>
<p>Although there are many toys on the market now, the prices are quite considerable, and ordinary people cannot buy them at will. But we may as well use our spare time to sort out the leftover scraps of fabric from making clothes, and use these kinds of waste materials to make some interesting little toys, which will definitely be welcomed by children.</p>
<p>The method of making it is not difficult. According to the picture of the little pug (below), cut the cloth pieces to the size of the dimensions. First sew the body and the inner layer together according to the solid lines to form a cylindrical shape. Open the opening under the belly and make it hollow in the middle. Then sew the face (preferably with white cloth) and fill it with cotton (the exposed part of the face should be smooth). Sew and tie the lower end. Then attach the two ears to the head and sew them tightly in conjunction with the head (the position of the ears should be placed evenly). Sew all four legs, fill them with cotton, and then place them as shown in the picture (above). Draw the face, tie a ribbon around the neck, and finally tie a small bell on the ribbon. The whole thing is completed. It doesn't have to be made of velvet, ordinary cloth can be used.</p>
<p>The method of making a small dog is extremely simple and very exquisite and lovely. Children will definitely like this little toy. You may wish to try making it.</p>

<h3>Visiting the YWCA Nursery</h3>
<p>— Dong Yan</p>
<p>If you have children who are not yet of school age, and you have to go to work every morning until dusk before you can go home, and there are no servants at home or you are not comfortable leaving them to her, then how to place your children will inevitably become the biggest problem. In the Soviet Union and in various countries in Western Europe, there are nurseries everywhere to take care of your children for you. After you finish work, you can pick them up, just paying a small fee. But in China, even in Shanghai, it is difficult to find such an ideal nursery where you can leave your children and work with peace of mind. Even if there are, the limitations of the number of places and the remoteness of the location cause many inconveniences, so we hope that nurseries will gradually increase in the future. This is a sacred service work.</p>
<p>It is said that there are only two nurseries with relatively large scale in the entire Shanghai. I visited the nursery at 66 Daxi Road, affiliated with the YWCA. Ms. Zhen Shanming, the clerk, sincerely answered many trivial questions for me. She said: The predecessor here was the nursery for working women, founded four years ago. Last March, due to economic reasons, it merged with the fully obligatory labor nursery. Now there are ninety-five children under their care. The oldest is seven years old, and the youngest is only ten months old. 30% of them pay a monthly fee of 7,500 yuan (including room and board), and the remaining 70%, except for a few who receive reduced fees, are completely free, and even their clothes, shoes, and socks are provided. Most of these expenses are raised by the YWCA, and recently donations have gradually decreased, and the future is uncertain. The landlord has also repeatedly urged them to move out. For these two points, Ms. Chen hopes that all parties will provide assistance.</p>
<p>The Relief and Rehabilitation Administration originally had flour rations, but later, because they heard that a part of them were charged, they notified them that they would stop the rations. This has had a great impact on them. Ms. Chen said that she would explain in detail to the Administration, explaining that most of them are completely free of charge. Then calculate for them that the monthly fee they receive is just enough to buy vegetables, so there is still no solution for the expenses of staff salaries, fuel, clothes, shoes, socks, water, electricity, and rent. They currently have 20 nannies and teachers, 6 servants, plus Ms. Chen and the doctor, a total of 28 staff members. Some people think there are too many, but please think carefully: If you have four children at home, an ordinary servant may not be able to cope. So it is really not too many, and to take care of the children safely and comfortably, this is not the most ideal ratio.</p>
<p>Afterwards, Ms. Chen led me to visit the entire nursery. The two rooms downstairs are where the children play, rest, and eat snacks. There is a large balcony in front of the window, and twenty or thirty lively and clean children are playing around at will, not shy, and call everyone "teacher" when they see them. There is also a large open space in front of the house, fenced off with wire mesh. The second and third floors are mostly children's bedrooms, with a dozen or so people sleeping in each room, with uniform short-legged small beds and white sheets. In the classroom, there are small tables and small buildings, distributed according to the size of the children. For the convenience of education and management, the children are divided into five classes. The largest class is about six or seven years old, and gradually smaller, the smallest class is ten-month-old infants, standing on the bed and crawling on the bed railings to practice their leg strength.</p>
<p>They have general medical equipment. If they suffer from skin diseases, they will be isolated and live separately. If they have colds and coughs, they will sleep quietly in the sanatorium. If unfortunately the illness is serious, they will be taken back by their parents, or they will be sent to the hospital, and then come back after they recover.</p>
<p>The children's daily life is as follows: They get up at six or seven in the morning to eat porridge. In the morning, they learn to read, tell stories, play games, and eat lunch. The lessons in the afternoon are the same as in the morning. The older class does arithmetic, eats soy milk at four o'clock, and eats noodles or steamed buns in the evening. They have to go to bed and sleep soundly at seven o'clock. They have to wash their feet once a day, and bathe once a week. Under the regulated life management, the children all grow up white and fat, energetic and energetic.</p>
<p>This kind of organization of nurseries is not new in our country, but there are indeed not many that are run successfully. If we want to promote women's occupations and increase family happiness, then nurseries are indispensable. Moreover, this is also extremely beneficial to the children themselves. At a young age, they are taught to learn group life and develop a lively personality, which is very important for their lives when they grow up. The new generation should be lively, endowed with a strong personality, and able to integrate into society as teenagers.</p>
