<h3>和談前途漸見開朗　聞蔣主席接受馬司建議　兩小組會會可能同時舉行</h3>
<p>〔本報南京今晨三時電話〕蔣主席對解決國事，過去一本和平及民主方式、今後決仍依此方針，以期求得和平。聞主席已接受馬歇爾特使。司徒雷登大使建議，使軍事方面三人會議及政治方面五人會議一併舉行。自主席返京後，馬，司兩使甘七日先後晋謁，並分別作深切之硏討，甘八日馬，司兩使再度晤商後，即行決定，如中共方面對此無異議，會議甘九日或即可舉行。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿八日電〕和平商談至甘八日下午，漸有開展跡象，周恩來雖仍滯滬未返，但對馬特使與司徒大使之覆函則已到京，其內容，有關方面均秘而不宣，下午五時甘分共黨代表董必武由王炳南陪同至美大使館，將周氏覆函面交司使，並談停戰問題，至下午六時十分辭出。記者適在使館，即趨前訪詢周恩來歸期，董則吿以局氏已有一信交司使，對周氏返京期避而不答。五分鐘後，大使即外出，大使與董必武諸氏均露愉悅之狀，似已有一開朗之途徑者然。六時半，王炳南復單獨往見馬特使，陳述此事。</p>
<p>〔本報南京甘八日電〕司使昨夜曾與其私人顧問傳涇波深切研究和談經過。甘八日上午九時半即訪馬特使，談約一小時，返館後接見國府參軍皮宗敢及國府秘書沈昌煥。</p>

<p>〔本報南京甘八日電〕據共黨代表團息，　在周恩來離京期內，即爲代表共黨與美方及政府接洽之代表，周氏離京已若干日，董氏以代表身份出塲，在今日尙屬首次。故衆信董必武或將取周恩來之地位而代之，惟共黨代表團發言人今晚曾稱：周恩來並未退出談判。發言人對目前和談方式，表示軍事三人會乃討論軍事問題之一合法與適合之機構，故共黨有召開三人會之建議，惟如政府方面認爲有其他適當機構足以商談軍事者，共黨自可考慮，然迄至目前止，共黨尙未接獲此種意見。另據可靠方面息，白來局勢可能有所轉變，惟調人則深盼周恩來早日返京，因周係三人會代表，亦爲五人會代表，召開會議接治問題，均能駕輕就熱也。</p>
<h3>廖承志飛返延安　報告政府及馬司態度</h3>
<p>〔本報南京甘八日電〕共產黨代表團廖承志，甘六日上午自大校塲機場乘美軍專機飛延安。</p>

<p>〔本報南京甘八日電〕美使館新聞專員康納士甘八日談：司徒大使甘八日曾訪馬特使，有所商談，內容不詳。外傳罵·司會向蔣主席提出新建議，渠對此毫無所知，記者詢以共然對馬·司聯名函已否答復，康氏稱：確知罵。司有一聯名信致周恩來，惟不知其內容，共方有無答覆尙不知。記者復詢以蔣主席已返京，周恩來可望即返，商談前途是否有可以樂觀之新跡象，康氏笑而不答，對某方所稱時局嚴重之說、亦不子批評。</p>
<h3>司使昨在使館宴我政府要人</h3>
<p>馬使爲其隨員證婚</p>
<p>〔本報南京甘八日鴛〕司使甘八日午邀請于斌總主敎，下午四時至太平路敎堂，參加馬特使行館伍副官之婚禮。六時一刻再赴伍副官宴，六時三刻返館，晚宴白崇禧·王世杰·將夢麟曁夫人及加拿大大使歐德崙。馬特使行館，因伍副官之婚禮，充滿喜　，午後四時，馬特使即赴教堂爲伍副官作證婚人。</p>
<p>〔聯合社南京甘八日電〕馬歇爾特使，廿八日在南京聖公會敎堂參加其隨員伍上尉與廣州嚴安妮泰女士之結婚嘉禮，親扶新娘至壇前，移授新郞，美陸軍要員及司徒雷登大使等外交官員多人，均到堂觀禮，新夫婦旋在馬使行館招待嘉賓。</p>

<h3>張垣爭奪戰將展開　綏東入察國軍進展甚迅速　進迫共軍重要據點南壕塹</h3>
<p>〔本報北平甘八日電〕關係方面息，由綏東入察國軍，分路進展甚速，收復商都尙義之部隊，已迫共軍之重要據據南壕塹，可能在該地與共軍演出激戰，南壕塹距張家口一百五十華里，國軍收復該地後，可分兩路，一路趨張垣，一路越過山地趨柴溝堡，與北路國軍會師，進迫張家口。</p>
<p>〔本報歸綏甘七日電〕據可靠消息，尚義已由十二戰區收復，進攻張垣之大戰，行將開始。綏東南凉城和林兩縣，鄉間共軍已漸肅淸，刻雙方在殺虎口對峙中。凉城境內山地尙有少數土八路，即可消滅。平綏路西段大同至包頭，火車一二日內即可通車，現僅距豐鎭東數里一橋樑尙未修復，此一橋樑工程，亦不甚大，預計甘七日晚或甘八日晨可竣工，此一橋樑修通，平綏路西段全綫通車即吿成。</p>
<p>〔本報北平甘八日電〕張家口之戰爭，待展開，但三五日後必可有車要消息，自信堅强之將領稱，一週即可下張家口，因估計共軍所能調動之兵力，不過蕭克之兩個旅，聶榮臻之一師與六個旅而已。國軍僅平綏東段正面，即可出動三個軍，勢不難一舉收復。流亡在平之察哈爾省府還省工作，已達緊張階段。冀東順義附近，共軍已被擊散，惟盧龍北建昌營及豐潤，續發現大股共軍三四千人，當局正派隊前往肅淸。冀東共軍雖退出城市，但仍出沒無常，故整個軍事牽制極一大。華北部隊現正調整位置，原警備北寗錢之九十四軍，將西移北平，所遺防務，交新遵海道北來之某精銳軍，担任原駐北平之九十二軍，另有新任務。</p>

<h3>社論　希王返國</h3>
<p>希王喬治第二已於甘七　乘飛機離英返國復位。在第一次大戰後，因爲一九二四年一　廿五日希臘宣佈共和政體，希王出奔。經過十一年的飄泊生活·公民投票勝利，返國復辟。第二次世界大戰，希臘戰敗。　王　度出奔。今年九月一日公民投票，贊成復辟的佔，百分之七十五·現在他又第二次返國復辟。</p>
<p>在二十世紀民主潮流的　　中間，希臘大多數人民，竟不要民主而要君主，這並不是他們不喜量歡自由，也並不是他們對於喬治第二有特殊的好感，乃是國際局面的發展，使他們不能不在君主與民主之間作一個選擇，明白的說，也就是在英美和蘇聯兩大集團之間，作一個　擇。</p>
<p>拿地形來說，希臘是巴爾幹牛島的門戶，是愛琴海最重要的鎖鑰。蘇聯要控制中東和巴爾幹，第一要爭取的是土耳其的韃靻尼爾海峽，第二要爭取希臘的愛琴海。然而這兩個國家的民衆和政府都不同情蘇聯。他們自已的力量，又無法足以抵抗蘇聯的壓迫。他們不得不借助外援，外援最可靠的當然莫過於英國，因爲英國在中東方面勢力已經大不如前，巴爾幹半島諸國又完全投人蘇聯的懷抱，爲自身利害計，英國不能不帮助土耳其和希臘。至於美國無論在戰時和戰後一直支持英國，對蘇聯總是採取一致行動。所以土耳其和希臘得着英國的帮助，也就可以得着美國的帮助。</p>
<p>希臘的總理薩達理斯早就看淸楚這個局勢，對英國一直友好。英國在希臘的軍隊已經駐了兩年沒有撤退，希臘政府的軍隊也不斷得着英國軍火的供給。至於希王出奔，先赴開羅，後至倫敦，同英國朝野，感情甚爲融洽。假如希臘不願意作蘇聯的附庸，希臘的人民不願意接　蘇聯「新式的民主」，就是共產黨的專政，他們唯一的出路，就是在外交上拉攏英國，這個外交路綫，希王喬治第二和總理薩　理斯當然是最適當的代表人物。在這種情勢之下，希臘百分之七十五的選民，也就表示歡迎喬治第二返國復辟了。</p>
<p>然而希臘的共產黨對於喬治第二的勝利，却痛心疾首。在公民投票的時候，他們就用盡方法搗亂，但是政府嚴密戒備，沒有成功。他們立刻宣佈　舉無效，並向聯合國安全理事會控訴英國，，同時從蘇聯的附庸阿爾巴尼亞及南斯拉夫取得軍火，在北部山區發動內戰。現在希臘政府軍隊雖然佔優勢，因爲共產黨有外援的關係，澈底消滅還是很不容易的事情。</p>
<p>希臘總理在二十五日招待各國記者發表書而聲明，略調：「戰爭由國外轉移至希臘，以遂其利用混亂局面取得愛琴海出路之目的，此事昭然若揭。外國勢力在聯合國安全理事會利用其否決權，阻止組織國際調査團，視察希臘邊境。」同時倫敦方面，希臘大使館發言人亦稱：「希臘北部山區之激戰，係破壞份子自阿爾巴尼亞與南斯拉夫侵入所致。」此外，英國外交部發言人更稱：「若希臘憲兵與軍隊出任勤務都吿失敗，則最後當由英軍出而維持秩序。」這三個聲明，可以說明希臘現在實際的狀况，與英國的顯明態度。希王喬治第二產這次回國，他的天下也並不是很太平的。</p>
<p>我們爲現在世界五強旣然都在高唱民主，對於世界上任何一個國家的內政外交，就不應當加以干涉。一個國家裏而大多數的人民，應當有全權決定他們自已的政治制度，選擇他們國際間的眞正朋友。國內少數政治團體也應當用民主的方式，合法的手續，光明的立塲，來爭取民衆的信任。外國不應無理干涉，在野黨更不應當動　乞求外援，發動內戰。現在希臘大多數的人民，百分之七十五以上，都已經有合法的表示，阿爾巴尼亞和南斯拉夫就沒有理由再去支持少數，而擾亂希臘大多數民衆的和平。至於希臘共產黨更不　當違背民意，用武力搶奪政　。不要說在目前局勢之下　奪不會成功，就算成功，全國人多數人民不肯擁護，也要終於崩潰。</p>

<p>〔法國新聞社莫斯科甘八日電〕蘇聯電台昨晚向土耳其人民發出呼籲，指責土國反動份子十正爲英美帝國主義所捉弄。略謂，土國報紙與電台漠視史達林元帥之和平呼籲，繼續形容國際局勢極其黑暗。此種策略意在掩飾國內局勢，而甘爲外國帝國主義者捉弄。此輩帝國主義者企圖在土國得寸進尺，英國除在土耳其海峽附近獲得各種基地外，並在土國各軍事大學中派有專家五千人以上，從事活動云。</p>
<h3>被呼賣國賊　奧外長揮拳打人　被警察當場逮捕</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社奧蒂羅爾省首府英斯勃魯克十七日電〕奧外長克魯倍與義締結協定，規定南蒂爾省自主後，奧殘廢軍人及戰時難民協會會長白拉斯提出抗議，要求舉行公民投票，但遭外長拒絕。克魯倍本日午前乘車來此，甫及下車，即遭白拉斯之組暴侮辱，大呼「賣國賊，」並聲勢汹汹，向其衝去，克魯倍反手一拳，擊中其面，白拉斯蹣跚倒退。旁觀者要求値崗之警察干涉，該警察答曰：「不關我事，我是來迎接部長的。」旁觀者吿以行兇之人，即爲部畏。警察乃恍然，當將白拉斯逮捕。</p>
<h3>駐伊領事煽亂說　英外交部昨否認</h3>
<p>〔本報訊」巴黎甘八日廣播倫敦訊：伊朗駐英大使前曾向英外部提出抗議，謂英國領事特勞脫與柯爾特二人陰謀反對伊朗政府，爆動土著部落叛變。英外部令日照會伊使，明白保證此事毫不確實。據英外部宣稱：英國雖已明確解釋，伊政府似仍不以此事爲已結束云。</p>

<h3>蘇聯境內日人遺返問題　美蘇代表即將恢復談判</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社東京甘八日電〕麥帥總部發言人頃宣布；關於蘇聯境內日本戰俘與僑民遺送返國問題，麥帥即將與　國對日管制委會蘇聯代表特萊夫揚柯將軍進行談判。特氏曾吿總部謂：奉本國政府命令，負責與麥帥開始談判云。査撤退日僑之談判，前曾於六月間一度舉行，旋因談判陷入僵局，逐於七月間宣吿終止。彼時特氏曾稱：本人僅負責討論朝鮮北部及中國東九省若干地區內日僑遺送問題，蘇聯本部所拘數十萬日俘，則不在討論範圍之內。惟目前之談判，則將包括蘇聯本部，庫頁島曁千島列島所有日俘在內，聞特氏代表與麥帥代表即將開始討論談判細則。又據可靠方面息：蘇聯準備自十月份起，自西伯利亞東部各港口撤退日人，每月一萬名至一萬五千名；並將自南庫頁島各港口撤退日人，每月七千名至一萬名。</p>

<h3>巴黎印政府代表　與蘇作秘密談判</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕巴黎甘八日廣播：印度臨時政府代表在巴黎與蘇聯代表秘密談判，因事關秘密，談話內容未經宣佈。英國代表對此甚爲關切。印代表定明日返國向尼赫魯報吿。</p>
<p>〔路透社莫斯科廿七日電〕「消息報」評印度臨時政府成立事稱；英國請尼赫魯組織印度臨時政府，意在將該國經濟危局及種族鬥爭之責任，卸諸國大黨之肩。此舉可爲英人對於印度民族運動之一種讓步。印度政府之閣員，與印督之行政委員不同，惟國大黨領袖，旣已接受當政之責任，即不得不對其原有之要求，接受相當之限制。新政府旣非向印度立法機構負責，英軍亦無退出印度之表示，英方且重申前此之憲政地位，仍不變更，以小惠易大惠，此英國對印度所施之技倆也。</p>
<h3>一九一九·一九四六年　兩次巴黎和會比較（中）</h3>
<p>— 祿煜</p>
<p>（四）組織之不同</p>
<p>在組織機構上，上屆和會與此次和會間，有四大異點，試分述之：第一，和會之隷屬系統——在前已述及，一九一九年之和會賦有處理對德和約之完全權力，故該時之和會乃一最高權力機關，在其上並無其他更高機稱。此次和會僅屬諮詢性質，在其上又有四强外長會議，和會所討論之議案，大部係由四强外長會議所提出，而和會所通過之決議，尙須經四强外長會議作最後之審核。第二，和會與國際和平機構之關係——上屆和會開幕時，國際聯盟尙未成立，蓋國際聯盟係巴黎和會所通過的凡爾賽和約之產物，故先有和會而後有國聯。在本屆和會召集時，聯合國早已存在，且已展開活動，因聯合國之設計，遠在戰事結束以前，故其產生與和會毫和關聯。第三，和會之內部組織——上屆和會之內部組織機構，可以「會中有會」四字描寫之。全體大會（由所有出席國家參加之）之上，存「十人會議」（由美總統與國務卿及英·法·義·日四國總理與外長組織之），「十人會議」之上，有「四人會議」（由美·英·法·義四國首領組織之），在義國代表奧蘭多因阜姆問題憤然離開巴黎後，「四人會議」改爲「三人會議」，此　　巨頭者，乃美之威爾遜總統，英之勞合喬治首相與法之克雷蒙梭總理是也。該會係和會中握有「說最後一句話」之　稱，於極度秘密中舉行之。此外，和會之日常事務與審査工作，則由指定的五十八個小組委員會所負責。本屆和會之組織機構、遠較一九一九年之和會爲簡單，祗分三部份，全體大會，各小組委員會與秘書廳。全體大會決定各項問題，交有關的各小組委員會研究。各小組委員會則就全體大會交來之問題提出報告，並條陳各項意見，以供全體大會之採納，小組委員會之數目，亦遠不及上屆和會所設立的多，祗有九個：（一）對義和約之政治委員會，（二）對羅和約之政治委員會，（三）對保之政治委員會，（四）對匈和約之政治委員會，（五）對芬和約之政治委員會，（六）對義和約之經濟委員會，（七）對羅·保·匈·芬和約之經濟委員會·（八）對義·羅·保·匈·芬和約之軍事委員會，（九）法律委員會。除上述之九個特種委員會外，大會又設立一綜合委員會，由全體會員國參加，其任務爲調整其他各委員會之工作。惟本屆和會雖無「會中有會」之現象，却有「會外有會」之特徵，此即前述之四强外長會議是也。第四，和會對戰敗國之態度——一九一九年之和會，對待戰敗國——德國——之　　態度，極爲嚴厲，旣不准其列席會議發言，又迫令其無條件接受和約。本屆和會則不然，旣邀請五前敵國——義·羅·保·匈·芬——出席和會之全體大會與各小組委員會，又准許彼等口頭陳述意見或書面提出請求。此種寬待戰敗國之態度，値得　許。此項　變，一則或由於今日乃民主時代，戰勝國一手包辦之和約，恐將爲全世界愛好民主，自由之人士所抨　，二則或因目下國際情勢較一九一九年爲緊張與微妙，各强國均企圖利用或拉攏昔日之敵國，以增厚自己一集團之勢力。</p>

<h3>危害東南半壁民生　傳式說判處死刑　聞判含淚欲滴妻女相對悽然　李祖萊判處徒刑五年</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕僞府巨頭之一傳式說，昨日由高院判處死刑，褫奪投。總之被吿當初因意志薄弱，公權終身，全部財產除酌留家屬必需生活費外，沒收。審判長解釋判決要旨稱：本件被吿傳式說，於在逆成立僞國民政府時，即首先參加，歷任僞鐵道建設兩部長，參與要議，決定政策。後於僞浙江省長任內時，更實施淸鄉、危書東南半壁民生。綜其所爲，實屬罪無可恕，故判處死刑，以昭烱戒云。傳昨衣灰袍，足穿皮鞋，精神衰頹，聞判色變，含淚欲滴。審判長吿以如若不服，可於接到判決書後十日內，向最高法院申請覆判，否則本院亦當代爲請求。傅未有多言，僅以斷續欲泣之語聲，要求庭上准其與家屬略談數語，審判長答以今日時間侷促，可改日在獄中接見，言畢論令還押。其妻女追隨於後，慘然欲淚。女更低呼「爸爸」，傳以淚眼相對，感喟無已。</p>

<h3>偽府一巨頭　陳春圃審結　自稱「省長」任內　僅係「看家」性質　巧辯數點悔之晚矣</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕傳式說昨由高院判處死刑後，同日，另一僞府巨頭陳春圃，由高院審結，定十月四日宣判。</p>
<p>按陳現年四十七歲，廣東新會人，爲汪逆精衛之內戚，係「公館派」之主腦人物。原係中國國民黨黨員，歷久供職於黨政各機關，後任僑務委員會委員長及僑民敎育處處長。迨中日戰興，汪逆勾結日寇，叛國求和，陳即於民國廿七年十二月先在逆而離渝。嗣汪逆在滬與敵寇商訂「和平基礎方案」，籌組偽府，又受召充其私人秘書，追隨左右。迨協商旣妥，即共同僭竊南京，樹立僞</p>
<p>政權，在日寇及汪逆卵翼之下、於廿九年三月出任僞行政院秘書長，兼僞政治委員會副秘書長及僞中央執行委員會執行委員與副秘書長。卅一年十月調僞建設部部長，卅二年兼僞中央黨部組織部長，卅三年四月調僞廣東自省長兼僞廣東綏靖主任。卅四年二月交卸，改任偽國民政府委員，直至勝利爲止。勝利後被捕，由高檢處提起公訴。</p>
<p>陳昨衣靑灰長衫、鼻架無邊眼鏡，聲辯數點：（一）民國廿七年十二月伴送汪之子女赴港就學，絕非事先通謀叛國而先行離渝。（二）在發表之艷電，完全不知。事後在港閱報始悉。（三）任汪之私人秘書，僅管理公館內之事務。關於政治上之電報文件往來，另有機要秘書執掌。（四）「南京會談」，「胥島會談」，簽訂「中日基本條約」「中日同盟條約』發表「中日滿宣言」「對英美宣戰佈吿一等皆未參與。汪屢次赴日，亦從未跟去。關於「靑島會談」及「南京會談」被吿是否參加，可詢陶希聖高宗武兩先生證明。（五）僞副秘書長等職，多係掛名，一切事務全山僞秘書長負責辦理。（六）僞建設部任內，從未有簽訂喪失主權之條文。反之，興建水利，如　　工作等。（七）任僞廣東省長，時僅八月，全係「看家」性質。類同傀儡。但曾努力抑平糧價，改善民生，廣東之米價，當時爲陷區之最低者。（八）數年來如嚴禁賭博，剷除烟苗，舉辦冬賑，資助慈善事業等事，自問無不有利於國家及人民，而在未離渝前亦曾募得救國公債四百餘萬。（九）『公館派』之名詞，係日人所杜造，意欲分化，實際上並無其事云。並聲明兩點：（一）民國廿七年時，因未參加黨員總登記，故已失去黨籍。（二）卅四年九月十七日向中統局自一時失足。在死，決心辭職，僅掛一僞國府委員之空名云。</p>

<h3>人絲紗布狂漲中　王部長談抑平辦法</h3>

<h3>「清宮外史」主題</h3>
<p>— 陶熊</p>
<p>「淸宮外史」是描寫涵淸帝制的腐敗，以及慈禧太后的專權，光緒帝的軟弱，李蓮英的專橫，卑鄙和無恥。使我們看出中國近百年的喪權辱國和帝國主義者的大胆侵略，都是由於這三個人所造成的！</p>
<p>假使光緒帝不那麽軟弱，而是一個敢作敢爲的人，中國也不致於被弄成現在這樣的情形，日本帝國主義者也不敢有鯨吞中國的念頭。</p>
<p>假使慈禧太后不那麽專權，一切不以個人做出發點，而以國家民族爲前題，由着光緒帝去向日本　戰，在朝鮮和日本一決勝負，日本也不敢那麼輕視中國！那麼，中國近代的歷史就不會像現在這樣的糟！</p>
<p>李蓮英雖然是一個太監，他却仗着慈禧太后的竉愛；以家法挾制光緒帝，以勢力壓迫各大臣。公然行使賄賂，收取陋規，假傳聖旨，僞造捷報。當事發被檢舉，光緒帝想殺一儆百，偏偏怒禧太后出來輕輕一句話，就把這件事擱置一邊，不讓再提，這使李蓮英更專橫無所忌。因此，也就成了「和議出自皇太后意旨，太監李蓮英實左右之」的局面。假使他是一個忠誠的太監，中國近百年的歷史當然是另一種局面，決不會比現在的壞，一定會比現在的好！</p>
<p>「淸宮外史」是一　戲劇，更是一部近代的歷史。它吿訴我們：由於少數幾個人的專權與無能，會把整個國家民族陷於不振，會使全國人民生活在痛苦與恥辱裏！</p>
<h3>燈光與色彩</h3>
<p>— 文泉</p>
<p>照明，已經成爲燈光原始的使命了。它在戲劇中新的任務是：它要描繪自然間（詩歌的）美妙的韻律，它要陳訴音樂裏蘊藏的心靈活動的意境，它要完成佈景運動的功能，色彩的欣賞，立體的美感，物理的平衡，它還要製造全劇氣氛的流動，性格轉幻的醞釀。它是一稱艱鉅地的靈魂的工作。無怪乎Adolphe　Appia說：光是現代舞台的生命。TerenceGray說：戲劇的表現，有三分之一是靠着光生動的運用才能獲得。</p>
<p>一切物體的形與色，均由物體的反射而得知。尤其是色彩，它所能表現其本身色彩時，是因爲它留下它本身不能吸收的色彩，而又反射（Reflection）出來的原因。說得具體一點，譬如白的色光，投射於樹葉上，這樹葉便吸收了白光中的其他六種色素，反射出它不能吸收的綠色，而成綠色。同樣藍色的膠片，亦因爲它能吸收白光中除藍色以外的六種色素，故經過此膠片的白光，便發成藍色。這是極簡單的色性。另外，光色與染色的配合，會產生第三種的混合色彩，（前曾專題述及）這便是燈光唯一步入更新的藝一術階段的主因。這主因不能發揮更多元的，善變地智慧，燈光之藝術價値，便重歸毀滅。</p>
<p>要表達戲劇立體的以及建築性的遝動感，首先要注意它的光源。自然界的光綫，是表達立體最完美的色光。可是藝術的慾望，是常常要求勝過自然的。於是在物體合理的光影以外，我們要求它伸長或縮小，我們要求某些光影上染有補色。這裏我願意舉一個偉大的理想：如「馬克白斯」魔穴的一堪，當那幾個巫婆在那赤色的火前煎熬着血腥的玩意的時候，在那畫有深赭色巨大如魔爪的樹葉的地背景上映上幾個暗綠色（赤色之補色）的巨大魔影，這該是多動人的畫面。一切燈光藝術，要表達的氣氛，情調，以至於心靈的意境，佈景的遝動等，都表現無逍。</p>
<p>色光的運用除了最基本的幕倣自然或變幻佈景色相以外，進一步的投射倒影完成之面象地立體地，外在物理的力與內涵戲劇的力的衝擊以外，它要能如畫龍之點晴。以有力的色觸，統一戲劇的形色，創造戲劇的靈性。那些造型的活躍，空間的透視，幻境的生動，畫面的和諧，都只是些初級藝徒的直覺，不足道爲止境。</p>
<p>戲劇是採摘於活生生的世界中無數有生命物的遭遇所組成。以各有生命的演員的靈魂，七情，及經歷，親身去旅行一下角色的遭遇，配合着各舞台技術人員，共同完成劇本中所創作的戲劇藝術。在演員，以有生命之人，創造有生命的藝術，當然較之以無生命的佈景燈光創造有生命的藝術容易。相反亦正因爲它困難，而增高了它藝術價値。愛披亞在華格納（Wagner）的樂劇中，發現了燈光的催眠作用，於是他運明色彩中的一切知識（色彩色相及明暗的暗示與象徵力）使森林岩石等一切背景，均與動作一致和　而運動。這在當初固然是一種驚奇的發現，而今已成爲必然的知識了。我們知道，當夕陽初下，霞光遍野的時候，會給我們一種　緩愉快的流動，另如黑　飛馳。電光一閃之後，便會給我們一種不安忐忑的顫抖，這種力量難道不就是色光所賜予？另外，在催眠術中，使人注視一轉動地品亮光盤，久久地便失去了理智的活動。此時他便任憑我們在他腦中灌些什麽，他都會誠實的信任，而隨着劇情喜怒哀樂一，而完成戲劇敎育的功能。</p>
<p>光爲色之毋，色爲光之素。此素質在人類生活史上，已經有它亟穏固的價値與情感，欲直接打入觀衆感官，避去觀衆成見與心理過程，色光較白光　勁健有力。更容易激發人的憤怒，更容易闖入最高藝術境界。</p>

<h3>生活與藝術</h3>
<p>— 高衡</p>
<p>生活是藝術的搖籃！</p>
<p>生活是藝術家的寶庫！</p>
<p>藝術家必須向這費庫深深地掘發，這樣，他的藝術品纔會生動，纔能眞實；他的藝術生活纔能進步，纔有成就；戲劇是藝術中的綜合物，也即是藝術中的築中表現者，換句話說它是藝術中最有力最尖銳的一環。</p>
<p>一章詩歌唱出了人間的心曲，一篇散文道出了社會的不平，一則小說訴出了世界的崎嶇，一闋樂曲奏出了人類的哀怨，一幅圖畫描出了宇宙的醜惡，而一幕戲劇必須把詩歌，散文，小說，樂曲，圖畫各部門表現的精神搬上舞台，把人類社會間的哀怨，不平，醜惡，眞實，善良，美麗給予表揚和針砭，這是藝術的總匯！更是生活的洪流！</p>
<p>戲劇中所表現的不外是戰爭，愛情……，這些都是人類生活的一面，人生是一塲鬥爭，在每個人求自身的生存條件下，發生着各種的鬥爭，你得和愛情鬥爭，和戰爭鬥爭，和金錢鬥爭，和麵包鬥爭，和寒冷鬥爭，和慾望鬥爭，和別人鬥爭，還得和自己的內心鬥爭。這正是人！這正是人的生活！這正是生活的各形相！也正是藝術中所表現的各個面！</p>
<p>因此，一個藝術家，尤是是戲劇藝術家，必須要深入人類的各階層，各角落，在各各不同的角度去觀察，體騐，分析，硏究，然後運用你正確的思想熱烈的情感再反映到你的藝術上來，這樣你的藝術纔會眞正地做到「生活的反映」。</p>
<p>如果你想做一個戲劇藝術家，你必須走到熱鬧的街頭，冷寂的鄕村；高樓大厦，茅草矮屋，闊人的公館，窮人的住宅；閨秀的嬌閣，乞婦的牆角；甚至於你也得去呼么喝六的賭窟去看看，到色相無遮的淫寮去瞧瞧，你還得和醫師，律師他們交交朋友，你也要跟算命，測字他們聊聊閒天…這纔是生活！這纔是學問！這是戲劇的素材！這是戲劇家的養料！你必須緊緊地把握它！你必須牢牢地擁抱它！</p>
<p>這還不够，你必得在這人羣裏和他們生活在一起，呼吸他們的氣息，體騐他們的痛苦，了解他們的思想，交流他們的情感，深人他們靈魂的深處，愛他們之所愛，恨他們之所恨，樂他們的樂，悲他們的悲；這樣才算心傾神會，融會貫通；然而你還得愼重的注意，你的情感和理知必得要適當的控制。</p>
<p>一個戲劇家，不能是個病人，應當像個高明的醫生，他診斷社會的病症，了解人民的病苦，開出對症下藥的單方，向人類公佈出他的診斷報吿書，這樣纔能防止疾病的漫延，恢復病人的健康，人類社會才能得到實際的裨益。</p>
<p>所以，你必須健全你的生活。豐富你的生活，向人民的心和意念深深地走去，向生活的洪爐勇敢地走去，這是掘發不盡的寳藏啊！</p>
<p>戲劇家們，你先得活在人民的心里，人民才會活在你的藝術里。</p>

<h3>聖城記裏的白楊</h3>
<h3>人與鼠中的人物</h3>
<p>— 吳永剛</p>
<p>夏知氷應時傑李若蘭三個人是同學，又是密友。知氷和時傑同時都愛着若蘭。若蘭是知氷從小在一起長大的表妹。童年生活的追憶使知氷深愛着若蘭，同時也加深了他的痛苦，因爲他有一種矛盾的性格；是唐吉訶　型的勇敢正直，哈姆雷脫型的猶豫遲疑。他爲自己的貧窮和孤傲的性格而悲哀，也把自己的貧窮和孤傲的性格比成爲西哈諾的大鼻子，因爲大鼻子是西哈諾戀愛上的累贅，於是他也把自己的愛情隱藏在心裏，讓時傑獲得了若蘭的愛情，但是他又　脫不了自己矛盾的剪不斷，理還亂的心情，懷着一般出身於小資產階級的智識靑年所共有的悲哀。</p>
<p>時傑是一種相反的性格，他有高貴的家世，瀟洒的儀表，和明朗的性格，什麼事敢說敢做，只求達到目的而不擇手段，甚至可以把自己的幸福建築在別人的痛苦上。</p>
<p>若蘭是個天眞無邪的少女，她享受着一切人對於她的愛撫，在她的心裏並不知道人間有什麽愁苦。</p>
<p>三個人在學校裘同演過西洋名劇「西哈諾」，知氷扮演大鼻子西哈諾，若蘭演善霍克桑，同時知氷替時傑和若蘭宣佈了訂婚的消息。這使他自己的內心更悲哀，更痛苦。終於一個啓示使他從戀愛的痛苦衷解放出來，他想去盡一點人的靑任，做一點人的事業，他認爲中華民族如果不能在帝國主義底下解放出來，就永遠不會有自由生存的機會，他懷念着淪陷在日本帝國主義鐵蹄下的東北故鄕。所以他必需爲了他的故鄕做點事，必需和鼠型的人鬬爭，甚至把他們消滅！但在最後，他還是守着若蘭，雙雙爲了國家民族英勇地犧牲！</p>

<p>— 定山</p>
<p>龐虛齋出品以倪雲林「元暉都司」一軸爲壓卷，亦全會之壓卷也。何師尊猫石圖年份　宋，戴進仿燕文貴山水，亦精。若李成郭熙，此老藏中甚有佳者，秘而不出，以葉公之龍示人，何耶？</p>
<p>王仲明爲本展發起人之中堅，家有黃子久九峰雲齊，足爲元四家冠冕，乃秘藏不出。出品僅馬文璧幕雲詩意，姚　竹禽，文徵明存菊，華秋岳柳燕三圖，使人之意缺然；然皆佳品。</p>
<p>張葱玉收藏甚富，出品亦甚多，褚幕關亭，米元章跋，可謂超超元著矣。吳仲圭竹石，陳秋水爲言思齋作山水，馬文璧春水樓船，皆元人之精品。獨於倪雲林不出虞山林　，遂　虛齋之元暉都司獨步冠時；豈葱玉寶此神品，尙不欲輕易示人耶？</p>
<p>吳湖帆出石濤長江一覽圖卷，鉅製也。</p>
<p>王南屛所藏米友仁瀟湘奇觀，與周湘雲舊藏同爲二絕。米氏雲山所見於世者，恐亦僅此。兩卷雖皆殘破，然王卷實勝；周尙可精修，苟得好手裝池，定能神明煥發。南屛其有意於米氏功臣歟？</p>
<p>馮超然有范寬北岳岡，譚和厂有馬遠踏歌圖，吳湖帆有趙伯駒仙山樓閣，張葱玉有趙雍秋溪靜釣，乃本展中眞宋畫之龍象也。</p>

<h3>金冬心的自畫像</h3>
<p>— 周曙山</p>
<p>清人金冬心的題畫記，夙爲世所珍視，而其有題自畫像記亦不少。今又見其七十三歲時的一幅自畫像，原爲畫贈其友丁敢身，而後載於西冷印社之「名人人物集」，其題其畫實俱爲珍品。</p>
<p>此自畫像，美髯肥頸，無帽寬衣，背拖短辮，手拄　杖，目向前視，狀若徐行，而杖之長過其身有半，宛如一釣竿。其像旣瀟　脫落，形似野叟；其畫更簡古樸茂，逸趣橫生，斯誠不愧名家之作也。又曾見『冬心光生集』首，亦印有他一幅晚年的畫像，與此七十三歲的自畫懷相似，但爲後來丁文蔚據任渭長所畫以重幕者。尙有「揚州八怪」之一的高翔（西唐），曾爲其畫四十七歲像，亦稱爲名作</p>
<p>金冬心，名農，字壽門，淸，錢塘人。於乾隆初舉鴻博，不就，而以詩，文，書，畫流寓於揚州，因亦爲「揚州八怪」之一。著有『冬心集』，其雜著亦夥，至此自畫像的題記云：</p>
<p>一占米寫眞，在晋則有　愷之爲裴楷圖貌，南齊謝赫爲濮肅傳神，唐王維爲孟浩然畫像于刺史亭，宋之望寫張九齡眞，朱抱一寫張果先生眞，李放寫香山居士眞，宋林少蘊畫希夾先生華山道中像，李士霍畫半山老人騎趟像，何充寫東坡居士眞，張大同寫山谷老人摩圍開小影，皆是傳寫家絕藝也。未有自爲寫眞者；惟『雲笈七籤』所載，唐大中年間，道士吳某引鏡濡毫，自寫其貌。余因用水墨白描法，自爲寫三朝老民七十三歲像，衣紋面相作一筆　，陸探微吾其師之。圖成，遠寄鄕之舊友丁鈍丁。隱君。隱君不見余近五載矣，能不思之乎？他日歸江上，與隱君杖股相接，高吟攪勝，騐吾衰容尙不失山林氣象也。乾隆二十四年閏六月立秋日，金農記於廣陵僧曾之九節菖浦愈館。」</p>
<p>時此老人已年逾古稀，猶流寓於揚州之僧會，其恬淡高蹈之情可知也。惟亦不能自忘其衰老，而時思及故鄕與故人，此殆爲人之恒情。畫之左角印有「丁敬身印」一小方，以示其所藏，但不知其原件今是否猶存在於人間</p>
<p>冬心先生的風格，概可於其　，文，書，畫中見之，而其才氣之盛，亦於斯可見。允工　書，晚年所作，則與其畫同臻於簡素之境，故同爲仳人所珍。</p>
<h3>湖天春色圖（　虛　藏）</h3>
<p>— 清·吳歷</p>
<h3>上海收藏風氣</h3>
<p>— 潘伯鷹</p>
<p>今日上海收藏古書畫的人們正流行着一種可笑而危險的風氣。這壞風氣是，不收絹本專收紙本，並且要「新辣」的紙本。所謂「新辣」者，言其流傳收藏得仔細，雖是舊畫而觸手如新，新得利害之謂也。</p>
<p>唐，五代的畫多絹本不必談。即以宋元畫而論，宋徽宗的畫幾乎流傳的皆是絹本。王晋卿臨古用絹，自運（用現在的話說便是自己創作）則用紙。趙子昂錢舜舉皆是絹與紙並用。黃鶴山樵，倪雲林以後，紙本纔多。但明淸兩代因工藝的進步，絹索更緻密了。這兩代的畫畫家用絹的非常之多。明朝人並且更擴充絲織品的用處。除絹之外，他們更喜歡用綾子。吳梅村詩中曾描寫在綾子上寫字的愉快。所以古來傳世精品之中，絹本居其半數。現在若照上海收藏家崇尙紙本的標準，豈不是將書畫名迹，憑空割棄其半？</p>
<p>我們承認紙本壽命比絹本長，紙本收藏和開啓，（打開一張畫再將它捲起來，並不是一個無經騐的人所能作的。作得不好，便損傷了畫本）。都比絹本不容易受傷。這或許是今日上海收藏家要收紙木的理由。但，我以爲這也正是不要不藏絹本的理由。我友謝稚柳先生對於絹和紙的分別曾經有一絕妙比喩。稚柳說絹和紙比書畫中的一對兒子。絹的身體弱，紙的身體强。身體强的兒子固然好的多。身體弱的兒子，好的也不少。從來不曾聽說好兒子因爲身體弱就被趕出大門。這但比喩可說明顯已極。我以爲正因絹本不易保存，名迹日見損毁，所以收藏家格外要搜求絹本精品，加意保持，纔可以補救絹本先天的缺陷。若反推波助瀾，相率不收，那絹本的命運更不堪問了。</p>
<p>我們推求上海收藏家　趨於紙本，並且羣趨於「新辣」的紙本之心理，實在不能免於一個悲觀的解釋。這班收藏家並不是爲收藏而收藏，乃是爲賺錢而收藏。他們的收藏書畫等於囤積貨物。所以要揀最易銷的最不易壞的纔肯出本錢收進。「新辣」的紙本，無論眞鍳家或暴發戶都願意出錢買，所以收藏家的胃口都趨於這一途了。在經濟決定一切的原則下，我們也原諒這一種心理。但在這種壞心理成爲風氣之今日，愈演愈烈，則絹本名迹將絕於人間。現在上海爲中國惟一文物薈萃的中心。瘡痍滿目，藝文盡喪之時，上海這種風氣必將迅速傳染到各地。因爲上海是最有錢的地方都不收絹本，別處更不收了。</p>
<p>能收藏書畫的人，多半都是有閑錢的人。他們即使是企業家或各種商人，但至少對於書畫總是有些興趣的。所以我很想勸這些人，多在興趣上着眼。旣然玩書畫就不要再在書畫上打賺錢的主意了吧。從前一些鹽商的風雅被人傳爲笑談。但至少他們不曾在所玩的那些「風雅」上賺錢。今古人未必不相及。何必爲鹽商所笑。這樣便可以附帶地達到文化目的。絹本名迹因能同被收藏，便可多保存些。（同時也決不會賠了本）。若其不然，將來這些收藏家的子孫中，必有英傑的藝術家出來。他們要想找幾張絹畫，却不知早被他們的父祖所損毁完了！</p>
<p>所以我們很沉痛的說這是一種可笑而危險的風氣。</p>
<p>不過，我們仍舊相信，上海的眞賞鑒家依然不少。他們收藏書畫決不在絹和紙上有所軒輊。他們決是將欣賞的興趣，文化的目的，放在「生意眼」之前。同時社會上前華耆碩，和一班主持文化及敎育的中堅人士也必能善盡他們領導的責任。如若能够使這種風氣不再加甚，漸漸更能提倡到積極發揚的路上去，那就好了。</p>
<p>當社會風氣正走向下坡路之時，忽然有人說逆耳之言，總是聽來不大舒服的。收藏風氣，也應如此。惟以這種事情關係太大，而現在肯說這樣話的人太少，所以不揣冒昧作一個呼籲。知我罪我，只有付之宏達的諒解了。</p>
<h3>一寸山河一寸血　47</h3>

<p>從鼎元那裏回站，收到W君消息，說宋哲元已正式下令二十九軍全體動員抗戰。（這個命令，要是早下二十天，甚至早卞天，五天，也比較要有把握得多，雖說不能把日寇全部驅逐出境，至少可以給牠一個致命的打擊。）在百忙之中，我又向，W君提到鼎元的事，W君說「最好請他先上北平米，二十九軍幾位高級將領都在這衷，」並說一定可以負責介紹。我又把鼎元生病的事，和他的要求說明，問他可不可向張自忠，或馮治安，或任何一位師團長介紹，光下一個委任令。W君說「儘速試辦，一有消息，立刻奉吿。」我立即把這消息，寫了個便條，叫人送到鼎元那裏去了。</p>
<p>夜半十二點以前，間或還有一兩下砲聲，幾下零碎機關槍聲，一到十二點之後，完全靜　下來、靜肅得有些呌人不安。這兩大因爲情報十分忙碌，同時還得佈置手下人　，到附近地點偵察，衹能零碎休息，囚此疲倦不堪也許因爲過度疲倦，又　　氣　很低，有些　悶，同時還揣想着　　的戰局，和　元的事，便在睡坑上翻來覆去。好容易剛剛睡熟，却又驀然彼一聲巨響驚醒；好似一顆極大砲彈爆裂，述土炕都震得一跳。〇四號這時正在屋子裏，守候電訊，見我被巨　震醒，便趕忙說一不礙事，日人開火已經五分鐘了，想必這是砲彈炸裂……不過離開這裏很近」，他剛說着，便有外動進來報吿：「土山埂下，靠近電廠的角上，落下一顆炸彈」。</p>
<p>「炸彈」？我還有些朦忪，「怎麼不聽見飛機」？</p>
<p>「有一架，已經走得遠了，……度很高」，</p>
<p>我很奇怪，據日人情報，明明是說二十八日拂曉攻擊，怎麽半夜裏就鬧起來了？也許計劃有了變動？誰知一瞧鐘，已經指到五點七分了，因爲天陰，並不像平日那麽亮。這才知道，我雖覺得僅僅一　眼，却已睡了四個多小時了。</p>
<p>這時宛平一帶陣地，雙方砲火，輕重機槍，步槍，較以前緊密十倍不止。這由於以前日人屢决挑釁，我方未得主將的命令，不過稍事應付而已。這回却是明令抗戰，當然盡力攻擊。日方雖已出動飛機助戰，地上也有坦克車衝鋒，却是敵不過我軍　結了二十多天的忿怒，一旦發洩，猛烈無比？</p>
<p>從五點開戰到六點的這一小時中，收音機不斷的有好消息廣播出。我們放出去的三個外勤，也陸續有人回來報吿，知道宛平方面我方有利。六點三十分，北平廣播，根據戰地電話，證實我方已把豐台，陳家莊，黃土坡等地克復。七點鐘，南苑我軍，奪獲日寇坦克二輛，敢死軍　裏炸彈，炸燬日方巨型坦克車數輛，遏止敵人衝鋒陷陣的勢頭。九點三十分，我張自忠部下克復廊房，擊落日軍飛機一架，通州外郊，截獲坦克車三輛，擊燬二輛，殺敵數百名。</p>
<p>我根據近來十餘日的秘密情報，對於敵我兩方實力和陣形，極其淸楚，知道大戰一起，我軍必定無法阻遏敵寇的進展，因爲人數的比較，敵十我二；軍火的比較，敵新我舊，　全我缺，不說飛機坦克，我方一無所有，甚至連抵抗飛機坦克的高射　和平射砲亦付缺如。所持以爲抗敵的利器，僅僅是一鼓作氣的正義感而已。這芷義感，也可說是痛恨敵人無端侵略的一股悲憤，也可說是愛護祖國，不願山河淪陷於獸蹄之下的一股浩然士氣。無論如何，我知道這十　戰局情况，　　曾持久。</p>

<h3>後門交易</h3>
<p>— 少夫</p>
<p>此次美鈔暴漲，我會論列過，認爲完全是投機所致，果然，據昨日本報記者所調査的結果：中央銀行金融機構桀務檢査處處長李立俠談稱，一部分經營外幣買賣之錢莊，每日呈報之營業數字，與各荘每日在票據交換所中之交換額，柜差甚遠。此中尤以三泰裕興兩錢莊，涉嫌最重。中央銀行已派員澈査，如情節重大，決依法究辦。</p>
<p>我們　　這一澈査，定會査出重大的情節出來的。</p>
<p>投機本已是司空見慣，上海灘，大大小小，這類玩意多的是，但奇的是在此次涉嫌的那家三泰錢莊，就是三個月前中央銀行黃金案中的主角，已遭停業處分，前門雖被封，却從事後門交易，對講電話有數十具，已如此之規模，買賣活動又不止一天，爲什麼直到此次美鈔暴漲，才査出它在後門交易來，這眞是令人大惑而不解者。</p>
<p>亡羊補牢，雖已嫌晚，若再不補，難免不再有羊逃亡，我們希望當局正本淸源，這一次來個澈底，不然，說不定一兩個星期後，黃金或白米又來一次大翻騰。</p>
<p>上海動態</p>
<h3>哈同花園　改建公園</h3>
<p>— 征凡</p>
<p>「市中區需要公園！」這句口號老早就喊着了，爲了跑馬廳問題，許多人主張改建公園，這句口號喊得更起勁，於是不禁使人想到那聞名全國的「海上大觀園」——哈同花園來，在市中區佔了三百畝的地方，終年園門緊閉，廿讓那園中的亭台樓閣，逐漸坍毀，草木荒蕪，眞也太「糟塌」和「自私」了；本市工務局曾與該園的負責人數次商洽租用，闢作公園，供市民遊樂。據說哈同的繼承人方面極表贊同，裝修完竣後，就可開放，這樣市中區居民可獲得一個極好的遊息塲所，而哈同花園也將消失其「神秘性」了。</p>
<p>哈同花園的所以稱爲「海上大觀園」，當然是由於亭臺池石之勝，因爲向來不肯開放，所以園中的情形，不很爲外人所知道。民國八年，王逆揖唐寓居該園，　作「記愛儷園」一文，記述甚詳，什麽海棠艇。茝蘭室。黃糵山房·接葉亭·聽風亭。柳灣。絮舞橋。觀魚亭。捫壁亭。蜨隱廊·冬桂軒。詩瓢。崑崙源·引泉·九思庼·小瀛洲。挹翠亭。北洞天·石坪台·絳雪海·紅　村，……名目多至數百種；使人更覺一眼熱」，希望一覽爲快。文字的末了，王逆記着：「園主人好多，有賓至如歸之樂，名園勝地，魚鳥親人，未始非暫息勞薪之一助。一很有些沾沾自喜之概。</p>
<p>哈同花園，在史的意義上講，是與上海的興盛有着密切的關係的。那位猶太人哈同流浪到上海時，上海還不是「十里洋塲」；由於滿淸政府的昏　腐敗，被各國收買土地，開闢租界，市面漸漸繁榮起來，而哈同經營的地產業就大大的發了財；南京路上的高樓大厦，半數是哈同的產業：哈同大樓，迦陸大樓，慈淑大樓，以及數不淸的「慈」字「尼」字打頭的里弄房屋等都是。發了財，自然想享享福，於是不知聘請多少專家，耗費多少心血，化百萬金，費時三年，落成了這合同花園。</p>
<p>園中有隱事</p>
<p>哈同花園中的奇聞艷屑，是素爲上海人所注意的，會有某名士摭拾園中隱事，編著小說出版，後來其書爲人收買一空，就此絕版於市。總之，其中情形，也像紅樓夢中焦大的批評密榮兩府一樣。</p>
<p>民國初年時，園中居然還辦過一座大學，有着一個希奇古怪的名字——「會聖明智大學」，招考男女學生，就學者一切費用，都由園中供給。但校風頑固守舊，校規極嚴，而且入學者必須依時　　，　年茹索。逼得一般學生，多半中途越牆逃走。不久因學生羣起反對，掀動學潮，就此解散。其後又設立所謂「華嚴火學」，更是純粹的僧侶敎育。</p>
<p>哈同妻羅迦陵夫人是佛教的　信者，因此在愛　園中，結庵奉佛，一如寺院，還收養了許多僧尼，「禿頭」濟濟，儼然別有天地。羅迦陵本人並不生育，却　愛收養義子義女，那座「倉聖明智大學」的男女高材生，時常令他們拜於膝下，先後不下百餘人，弄得羅迦陵「駕返蓬萊」以後，養子女爭奪遺產，官司打得不亦樂乎。</p>
<p>但願快實現</p>
<p>言歸正傳：建議哈同花園爲公園，在民國三十年羅迦陵夫人死後就有人提出過，（再以前，自然誰也不敢提出，提出也沒有用。）英文大陸報曾特撰社論「使哈同花園成爲一公園」，建議「上海工部局」，立即行動，以獲取該一產業，作公園之用，並建議以投資方式，發行債券來作購置的經費。可惜後來就此無聲無臭。也有人主張在哈同花園開闢商塲，收益移充救濟事業，後來也無下文。</p>
<p>現在市工務局旣然有改哈同花園爲公園的計劃，這「海上大觀園」的開放，自無問題。我們亟切的預祝：這私人享樂的巢窟，不久就變爲數百萬市民的大衆樂園！</p>
<h3>魂兮歸來</h3>
<p>— 德雲</p>
<p>胆怯的我，小時候常因驚嚇成病，而麻煩了母親，在夜間給我「招魂」。我記得，我深深的記得：這是偉大的母愛。</p>
<p>但我相信，那時候，我確沒有失落甚麽，而在今日，每當深夜捫心有愧時，我才開始相信：我的確是失落了我的善良的靈魂了。</p>
<p>誠然，數年的社會生涯，已把我匯合於人海的穢流裏了。啊，上帝，我的美麗聖潔的靈魂，何所之了？</p>
<p>我要在這秋夜裏，像我的母親那樣，燃上一枝香，我要由衷的默默的祝　，要被迫失掉的聖潔魂靈，回到我的心裏來！</p>
<h3>慾望</h3>
<p>— A</p>
<p>精神慾望的單純化，使一個人終生有所寄託，生命有所歸宿；但物質慾望的錯綜複雜，却是永遠痛苦的恨源。</p>
<h3>三天的美國生活</h3>
<p>— 乘之</p>
<p>一年以來，美國物資充斥市場，無論食物。用品。衣着，無不光怪陸離，令人可羨可愛；雖然價廉而物美，窮小子可還不敢作此非份之想，但能蕩馬路，逛公司時，乘便看看櫉窗內各種雍容華貴，富　堂皇之美式配備，已經頗覺心滿意足了。</p>
<p>這次託美軍之福，復承物資供應局之情，以美軍剩餘食品三日糧，廉價配給公敎人員。我雖然覺得九千元還是肉痛，但是想到這不但可以一嘗美國風味，並且究竟還能享受三日美國生活，何樂不爲？所以也就很慷慨的付了款，等待着配給這一天的光臨</p>
<p>前日早晨，從配給處取到滿滿的九包東西，高興非凡，况且據說這批尙是一九四五年的物資，那所傳發霉情　當然不致會發生的。</p>
<p>五花八門</p>
<p>十二時正，我開始我三日的美國生活；光從抽屜中取出D字的一包，很小心地開啓那考究的包裝，把裏面的東西一件一件地拿出來，仔細觀察下，固然花色衆多，計有餅乾·乳酪。檸檬粉·方糖·香烟。火柴·糖果。橡皮糖·咖啡糖等多種。於是光將乳酪塗在餅乾上吃完，再來一大槐咖啡糖，然後是一杯檸檬汁，一枝香烟。下午工作開始後，還能　閒吃上一些糖果，雖然覺得有些甜膩，究竟相當滿意。</p>
<p>不大舒服</p>
<p>晚餐時，第一道是以一種粉末冲成的牛肉湯和餅乾，其决爲聽裝肉餅，最後又是巧克力糖和橡皮糖。這東西實在太甜，不感興趣；但是畢竟把牠勉强吃完。晚餐旣吿一段落，於是跟平日一樣開始看書。可是好像　不多時候，腹中已高唱空城計。今日所食之量，當然較往日爲少；但是　的方面就好得多。順便翻開一本關於人體營養的書，査上一査，固然不差。這些食品中，什麽維他命甲。乙·丙·丁·脂肪·淡水化合物。糖類。蛋白質等一應俱全。這一定出於美國營養專家之設計無疑；只要營養足，東西雖少跟身體無關；何况各國專家本來都以爲中國人吃得太多。這樣考慮之下，便坦然欲睡，可是腹中徧是咕咕作怪，不得安睡</p>
<p>翌晨黎明即起，待洗盥畢，立刻開始早餐，火腿蛋很不差，其他又是餅乾，糖果一類的東西，厭惡異常。餅乾實因飢餓，還能强行吃下，糖果則祇能敬謝不敏。今日未知是否就由於精神不爽之故，平日不費吹灰之力的工作，現在覺得似乎麻煩起來。</p>
<p>無福消受</p>
<p>今天的興趣，已遠非昨日可比。當我發現包中還是跟昨日一樣的東西時，更是一肚子不高興，不過眼看到同事們興高采烈，就不好意思說不好吃；更恐怕他們會取笑我無福消受。於是祇得勉强從事，裝得很高興的樣子把東西吃完。日中膩滑欲吐，腹中更有一種說不出的難受！</p>
<p>坐在我對面的同事，見我精神萎靡，承他美意，替我請了假，並且送我回宿舍休息。</p>
<p>一覺醒來，已經月上柳梢頭。自忖飯還沒有吃，祇得下牀，蹣跚地走到書桌前，打算拆那包夜餐盒子，我的眼睛瞪着那些餅乾及糖果發呆，食慾毫無；突然衝下樓去，把幾包東西都送給了工役金根。在他一疊謝聲中，我早踏進宿舍外的一爿小麵館，一碗陽春麵頓時使我精神陡增。</p>
<p>至此，我才深信自己是個起碼人，無福消受美國生活，更不配談什麼維太命。脂肪。蛋白質了。</p>
<h3>馬占山的趣事</h3>
<p>— 錦霞</p>
<p>有人自稱是馬將軍父親</p>
<p>昨天，本刋「新聞人物」談到馬占山，這裏還有一段史料可以補充。</p>
<p>在民國二十五年，將軍遭遇了一件趣事，這椿事，和他的威名一般，轟動了全國：</p>
<p>無理可喻</p>
<p>原來當時馬將軍從東北歸來之後，便寄寓天津英租界四十六號路，息影林泉，不問世事。忽然在二十四年七月間，有一個　潤老翁，名時馬榮的，來到天津，向法院　狀請求確認馬占山將軍係其失子。因爲管轄錯誤（原吿往　潤，應先向當地法院請求。）檢察官不予受理。不料馬榮在二十五年七月，再度來天津，往將軍住宅門前哭鬧不止，欲强認馬將軍爲子，馬將軍因爲幾次勸吿無效，知這無理可喩，便向天津地方法院刑庭，控吿馬榮妨害名譽。同時又向民庭請求確認和馬榮無父子關係。</p>
<p>開庭偵訊</p>
<p>開庭偵訊時，據駡榮供述，其子在七歲時散失，和馬將軍同年，同名，同姓，同省，同縣，他共有兩子，長子名馬占山，次子名馬守山，長子耳際生有拴馬椿（即肉瘤），請求鑑認，俾得父子團圓。</p>
<p>馬將軍談話，表明他原籍雖是河北豐潤，但世居遼寗省懷德縣，生父馬純，係在民國六年九月二十六日在懷德病逝。當由當日佐理喪事的張殿九，　泰來等到庭作證。並且將軍係光緒十一年出世，而馬榮失子的生日却是光緒十年臘月初八日。院方更命法醫檢騐，査實將軍耳際並無「拴馬　」。</p>
<p>滴血辨認</p>
<p>馬榮　　請求「滴血相認」，但法官認爲於法不合，根據現代醫學，滴血不足以作爲血統關係的證明。</p>
<p>當庭判決：「原吿與被吿，無父子關保。」一塲鬨傳全國的趣劇，便吿結束。</p>

<h3>The Prospect of Peace Talks Gradually Becomes Clear; It is Heard that Chairman Chiang Has Accepted Marshall's Suggestion; The Two Subcommittee Meetings May Be Held Simultaneously</h3>
<p>[This newspaper, Nanjing, telephone call at 3:00 AM this morning] Chairman Chiang has always adhered to peaceful and democratic methods in resolving national affairs, and will continue to follow this approach in the future in order to achieve peace. It is heard that the Chairman has accepted the suggestions of Special Envoy Marshall and Ambassador Stuart, to hold the three-person military meeting and the five-person political meeting concurrently. Since the Chairman's return to Nanjing, Marshall and Stuart have successively paid visits on the 7th and conducted in-depth discussions separately. After further consultations between Marshall and Stuart on the 8th, a decision was made that the meetings could be held as early as the 9th, provided that the CCP side has no objections.</p>
<p>[This newspaper, Nanjing, 28th dispatch] By the afternoon of the 8th, the peace talks gradually showed signs of progress. Although Zhou Enlai was still in Shanghai and had not returned, his reply to Special Envoy Marshall and Ambassador Stuart had arrived in Nanjing. The relevant parties kept its contents secret. At 5:10 PM, CCP representative Dong Biwu, accompanied by Wang Bingnan, went to the US Embassy, personally handed Zhou's reply to Ambassador Stuart, and discussed the ceasefire issue. He left at 6:10 PM. This reporter happened to be at the embassy and immediately approached to inquire about Zhou Enlai's return date. Dong told him that Zhou had sent a letter to Ambassador Stuart, avoiding answering the question of Zhou's return date. Five minutes later, the Ambassador went out. Both the Ambassador and Dong Biwu seemed pleased, as if a clear path had been found. At 6:30 PM, Wang Bingnan returned alone to see Special Envoy Marshall to explain the matter.</p>
<p>[This newspaper, Nanjing, 8th dispatch] Ambassador Stuart had a deep discussion with his personal advisor, Pu Jingbo, last night regarding the progress of the peace talks. He visited Special Envoy Marshall at 9:30 AM on the 8th, talking for about an hour. After returning to the embassy, he received Pi Zonggan, a military aide of the National Government, and Shen Changhuan, a secretary of the National Government.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 8th dispatch] Relevant personnel involved in the peace talks had frequent contact on the 8th. At 11:00 AM, Shen Changhuan, a secretary of the National Government, was ordered to go to the US Embassy to meet with Ambassador Stuart and his personal advisor, Fu Jingbo.</p>
<p>[This newspaper, Nanjing, 8th dispatch] According to information from the CCP delegation, Dong Biwu is the representative authorized to contact the US side and the government on behalf of the CCP during Zhou Enlai's absence from Nanjing. Zhou has been away from Nanjing for several days, and it is the first time that Dong has appeared as a representative today. Therefore, many believe that Dong Biwu may take Zhou Enlai's position and replace him. However, the spokesperson for the CCP delegation stated tonight that Zhou Enlai has not withdrawn from the negotiations. Regarding the current form of peace talks, the spokesperson stated that the three-person military meeting is a legitimate and suitable mechanism for discussing military issues. Therefore, the CCP has proposed convening the three-person meeting. However, if the government believes that there are other appropriate mechanisms to discuss military matters, the CCP can consider it. But so far, the CCP has not received such opinions. According to reliable sources, the situation may change, but the mediators deeply hope that Zhou Enlai will return to Nanjing as soon as possible, as Zhou is a representative of both the three-person meeting and the five-person meeting, and he is skilled at convening meetings and handling issues.</p>
<h3>Liao Chengzhi Flies Back to Yan'an to Report on the Attitudes of the Government and Marshall-Stuart</h3>
<p>[This newspaper, Nanjing, 8th dispatch] Liao Chengzhi of the Communist Party delegation flew to Yan'an on a US military plane from Daxiaochang Airport on the morning of the 6th.</p>

Liao's trip is of great significance. In addition to reporting on the attitudes of the two mediators Marshall-Stuart and the government negotiation representatives, he may also obtain a decision from the highest authorities of the CCP.</p>
<p>[This newspaper, Nanjing, 8th dispatch] Conner, a news officer at the US Embassy, said on the 8th: Ambassador Stuart visited Special Envoy Marshall on the 8th and had discussions, but the content is unknown. Regarding rumors that Marshall and Stuart have made new suggestions to Chairman Chiang, he knew nothing about it. When asked by reporters whether the CCP has replied to the joint letter from Marshall and Stuart, Conner said: He knew for sure that Marshall and Stuart had sent a joint letter to Zhou Enlai, but he did not know its contents and whether the CCP had replied. When asked by reporters whether there were new signs of optimism about the future of negotiations, now that Chairman Chiang has returned to Nanjing and Zhou Enlai is expected to return soon, Conner smiled but did not answer, and did not criticize the claim by some parties that the situation was serious.</p>
<h3>Ambassador Stuart Hosts a Banquet for Important Government Figures at the Embassy Yesterday;</h3>
<p>Marshall Presides Over the Wedding of His Aide</p>
<p>[This newspaper, Nanjing, 8th dispatch] Ambassador Stuart invited Archbishop Yu Bin for lunch on the 8th.

In principle, all groups will be withdrawn to Beiping, but any of the three parties may withdraw to other places if they deem it necessary. It is heard that the first to withdraw will be the Second Group in Chifeng and the Fourth Group in Xuzhou. The government and US representatives of the Second Group will withdraw to Beiping, and the Communist Party representative of the Fourth Group will withdraw to Linyi. The above personnel were originally scheduled to withdraw on the 7th, but due to bad weather in Beiping, the plane could not fly out of Beiping. It is hoped that it will take off on the 8th and fly back from both places simultaneously on the 9th. However, the US representative in Xuzhou will not withdraw, as this is a voluntary decision by the US side. In addition, the groups preparing to withdraw include the Third Group in Jinan, the Eleventh Group in Chaoyang, the Nineteenth Group in Anxiang Xinxiang, the Twenty-Second Group in Zaozhuang, and the Fifth Group in Zhangyuan.

<h3>Robertson's Resignation Has No Political Significance</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 8th, United Press dispatch] US Acting Secretary of State Clayton recently announced to the press conference: Robertson has long wanted to resign and return to his country for personal reasons. Marshal Marshall's acceptance of Robertson's resignation is only to fulfill the minister's firm will to return to the United States and has no political significance.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Beiping, 8th dispatch] Zheng Jiemin and Ye Jianying, two members of the Military Mediation Headquarters, expressed their reluctance at Robertson's departure from China.

<h3>The Battle for Zhangyuan is About to Begin; The National Army Entering Chahar from Eastern Sui is Progressing Rapidly; Closing in on the Important Communist Army Stronghold of Nanhouchang</h3>
<p>[This newspaper, Beiping, 8th dispatch] According to relevant sources, the National Army entering Chahar from Eastern Sui is progressing rapidly on multiple routes. The troops that recovered Shangdu Shangyi have approached the important Communist Army stronghold of Nanhouchang and a fierce battle may take place there with the Communist Army. Nanhouchang is 150 li away from Zhangjiakou. After the National Army recovers the area, it can divide into two routes, one heading towards Zhangyuan and the other crossing the mountains towards Chaigoubao, joining forces with the National Army on the northern route to approach Zhangjiakou.</p>

<p>[This newspaper, Beiping, 8th dispatch] The war in Zhangjiakou is about to begin, but important news will definitely be available in three to five days. Confident generals claim that Zhangjiakou can be taken within a week, as it is estimated that the Communist Army can only mobilize two brigades of Xiao Ke, one division and six brigades of Nie Rongzhen. The National Army can deploy three armies on the eastern front of the Ping-Sui Railway alone, making it easy to recover Zhangjiakou in one fell swoop. The work of the Chahar Provincial Government, which has been displaced in Beiping, to return to the province has reached an intense stage. Near Shunyi in eastern Hebei, the Communist Army has been dispersed, but large groups of Communist Army with three to four thousand people have been discovered in Jianchangying and Fengrun north of Lulong. The authorities are sending troops to clear them. Although the Communist Army in eastern Hebei has withdrawn from the cities, they still appear erratically, so the entire military constraint is extremely large. The North China troops are currently adjusting their positions. The 94th Army, which was originally garrisoning the Beining area, will move west to Beiping, and the defense tasks left behind will be taken over by a certain elite army from the Xin-Zun-Hai area. The 92nd Army, which was originally stationed in Beiping, has new tasks.</p>

<h3>Communist Army in Lianshui Fights Like Cornered Beasts; The National Army on the Hai-Tai Line Has Recovered Huangqiao; Communist Army Generals Hold a Meeting in Yancheng</h3>
<p>[This newspaper, Xuzhou, 8th dispatch] Fierce battles are taking place within Lianshui, with intertwined positions and intense fighting. The Communist Army is trying to fight like cornered beasts to cover its troops in the Funing area as they retreat towards Southern Shandong. The National Army is blocking them. The war in that area is expected to be resolved within a week.</p>
<p>[This newspaper, Taixian, 28th dispatch] On the Taixing front, the National Army, in order to clear the remaining Communist forces north of the Hai-Tai Line, recovered Huangqiao the day before yesterday. The Communist Army retreated along both sides of the Ru-Huang Highway, and the National Army swept them away in separate directions. Transportation between Ru and Huang will not be difficult to restore. The Communist Army between Gaoyou and Lianshui used the means of breaching dikes to hinder the National Army's advance, but the National Army has already cut off the communication between the two places. The Communist Army entrenched in the two places is clearly isolated.</p>
<p>[This newspaper, Taixian, 27th dispatch] Senior Communist Army generals Xu Xiangqian, Su Yu, Guan Wenyue, Liu Jiping, and others held a military conference in Yancheng on the 22nd of this month to discuss future strategies. It was decided that if positional warfare fails again, they would abandon urban strongholds and implement rural guerrilla warfare, and act in accordance with the predetermined strategy of "the enemy advances, we retreat; the enemy is tired, we advance."

<h3>The Corruption and Degeneration of the Communist Army is Exposed by He Long</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Taiyuan, 7th dispatch] The CCP Jin-Sui Border Region held a "Cadre Mobilization Conference" in Xingxian County on September 6th. It is reported that Communist Army Commander He Long's speech exposed the Communist Army cadres' corruption and degeneration, wavering will, and anti-internal strife sentiments. The general idea was: So many people don't even read the newspaper. What they can hear and see is playing the erhu, playing poker, building opera stages, and building houses. It's a scene of peace. If we want to continue fighting, we must start up our machine. Although the machine is very good, it is very rusty. The most serious phenomenon at present is corruption and waste. The Adjutant's Office of the Headquarters opened a shop. The people in the shop hooked up with a few prostitutes. They wear silk clothes, while some old people still wear fur coats in the summer. More than 50 old people in Caijiaya gave 120 dan of public grain. The burden on the old people is extremely heavy, but we don't know how to cherish it. The grain bureau ruined 900 dan at once. Corruption has become a trend in the financial and commercial departments and agencies. One corruption is hundreds of thousands or millions. Just talking about the things that the chief of the Materials Section of the Health Department embezzled is enough for his wife, children, nanny, and other seven people to squander for five years. The special commissioner's office specially built a theater in Xingxian County for watching operas, which cost 300 dan of millet. In order to make themselves spacious and convenient, they occupied more cave dwellings of the old people, so that the old people had no place to live, and three generations (grandfather, daughter-in-law, and granddaughter) rested together. Speaking of the production of agencies, they have occupied many of the old people's water fields. A few wells in Caijiaya have been occupied by the public. Speaking of the lives of ordinary cadres, everyone is idle and playing the erhu, playing poker, and playing mahjong. Are you all old masters? Some people still have wrong ideas about peace today. They want to make peace quickly and go to big cities. They ask people how the negotiations are going, thinking of Shanghai, Tianjin, Beiping, or even Zhangjiakou, considering themselves as a big talent and despising the Jin-Sui Border Region. These people have no conscience. We must plan for a long-term war, and we must resolutely continue to fight.</p>
<h3>Communist Army Generals Start Internal Strife; Demand Severe Punishment for Nie Rongzhen</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Beiping, 8th dispatch] The Communist Army's failed siege of Datong this time, and the widespread military defeat in eastern Hebei, Rehe, and Chahar and Sui, has caused friction and differences of opinion among its internal major generals. Zhu De recently arrived in Zhangjiakou from Yan'an and convened his important generals for a symposium. Nie Rongzhen's siege of Datong this time,调出 the powerful troops in the Rehe territory, causing the loss of Chengde, was the biggest mistake. The generals unanimously demanded that responsibility be investigated and that Nie Rongzhen be severely punished.</p>
<h3>Clayton Meets with Reporters; Explains US Policy Towards China; Hopes That Our Country Can Resolve Political Disputes Satisfactorily</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 7th dispatch] US Deputy Secretary of State Clayton told reporters today that the United States still has the hope that China's internal political disputes can be resolved satisfactorily, and said: The United States is following a policy based on this hope and, circumstances permitting, with the greatest patience and consideration. Clayton made this statement in response to a reporter's question as to whether the State Department had received any news that would restore the general atmosphere of optimism, that is, news that a ceasefire could be achieved within China. Clayton replied: No. The reporter asked this question because the United Press Nanjing newsletter reported that Marshall had an hour-long meeting with President Chiang at the President's residence and that the government invited Zhou Enlai to return to Beijing to reopen the talks. The official atmosphere in Nanjing was quite optimistic.</p>
<p>[United Press, New York, 7th dispatch] A Wall Street journal published an editorial today entitled "Look at China," which stated that the important part of Stalin's statement was not that he was unwilling to fight for things that could be obtained by other methods, but rather that he implied what the Soviet Union must fight for. "He clearly stated that the presence of US troops in China is enough to threaten peace. From this, it can be inferred that the Soviet Union has not achieved its territorial goals in the East, but actually wants to achieve them. If the United States continues to maintain its position of interfering in China, disputes may arise as a result. We believe that the Washington administration and the American people should think deeply about this matter and plan a policy as soon as possible to avoid formulating policies under coercion."</p>
<h3>Members of the Wartime Assets Investigation Committee Question the Case of Selling Surplus Materials to China</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 27th dispatch] The Senate's Wartime Assets Investigation Conference held a meeting today. Members of the Investigation Committee questioned Connor, the senior official in charge of the liquidation of foreign assets, and his assistant Lane about the sale of 800 million yuan of surplus materials to China. Lane said that China will pay the United States 275 million US dollars, with 150 million US dollars used to offset China's debt to the United States, and 25 million US dollars used to cover the transportation costs of surplus materials from the Pacific to China.</p>
<p>[French News Agency, Washington, 27th dispatch] Senator Fulbright recently inquired Major General Connor about the issue of the disposal of all surplus materials in the United States, saying: The United States allows China to use US aircraft and Air Force personnel to train Chinese pilots. Is the purpose to defend the Western Hemisphere's military aid to China bill, which has not yet been approved by Congress? Does the US government intend to start implementing the military aid to China plan before Congress approves it? Major General Connor immediately replied that, as of now, the assistance provided by the United States to China is limited to the materials that are currently in China, because the National Government led by Chairman Chiang is the only Chinese government recognized by the United States.</p>
<h3>Elders of the Diplomatic and Legal Circles Discuss the Issue of US Military Withdrawal</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, this city dispatch] A few people in Shanghai recently launched a so-called "Week of Responding to the US Military's Withdrawal from China Movement." For this matter, the reporter specially visited Wang Chonghui, Yan Huiqing, Wang Zhengting, Zuo Shunsheng, Zheng Yuxiu and other elders of the diplomatic and legal circles and social celebrities to inquire about their opinions. Summarizing the talks of the gentlemen, they believe that the US military's stationing in China was with the consent of our government to assist in the work of repatriating remains. Once the mission is completed, they should withdraw on their own, which is not enough to constitute diplomatic discussion material. We believe that in order to maintain world peace, it is best not to form the Soviet Union's two major camps in the world, so as not to threaten peace.</p>

<h3>Enthusiastic Discussion Lasts Three Hours; Legislative Yuan Passes Conscription Law; Women of Eligible Age May Receive Military Education</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 28th] The Legislative Yuan convened its 308th meeting at 9:00 AM on the 28th. Seventy-one committee members attended, including Ding Mo, He Sui, Wei Tingsheng, Liu Keshu, Chen Changheng, Jian Guansan, and Liu Guanxun. President Sun chaired the meeting. At the beginning, the entire assembly observed a three-minute silence to mourn the recent passing of deceased committee member Ling Yue and deceased committee member Peng Yangguang. Subsequently, the following agenda items were discussed: (1) The report from the Criminal Law Committee of the Yuan, in conjunction with the Legal System Committee, regarding the examination of the draft regulations for handling cases of traitors in the northeastern provinces and cities. A resolution was passed, stating that, based on the examination report, there was no need to formulate separate regulations. (2) The report from the Military Affairs Committee of the Yuan, in conjunction with the Legal System Committee, regarding the examination of the revised draft of the Conscription Law. During the discussion of this item, Xu Siping, Director of the Conscription Bureau of the Ministry of National Defense, was present to answer questions and explain the content. The draft was discussed clause by clause, with heated debate lasting three hours. A resolution was finally passed, approving the revisions. The full text consists of 35 articles, divided into ten chapters. Article 1 stipulates that "All male citizens of the Republic of China have the obligation to serve in the military according to law." Military service includes officer service, non-commissioned officer service, and soldier service. Service begins on January 1st of the year following the attainment of age 18 and continues until December 31st of the year of attaining age 45, when discharge occurs. Military service is divided into three categories: active duty service, reserve service, and national guard service. The first two categories are further divided into active duty and reserve duty. National guard service is divided into three types: initial service, Type A, and Type B. Comprehensive regulations are in place regarding service management, conscription, mobilization, rights, obligations, and penalties. Article 33 stipulates that women of eligible age may receive appropriate military auxiliary service education during peacetime and may be conscripted for military auxiliary service during wartime. Furthermore, the original regulations stipulated only four conditions for postponing mobilization and conscription for reserve and national guard service. After many argued that graduates of normal schools who have served as primary school teachers for more than one year should also be eligible for postponement, this was also approved. The meeting adjourned at 1:00 PM.</p>
<p>Resolution to Abolish Wartime Land Requisition Tax Regulations</p>
<p>The meeting resumed at 2:30 PM, and the following matters were discussed: (1) The Legal System Committee reported on its examination of the draft regulations for the Haihe Engineering Bureau's organization. A resolution was passed approving the revised draft. (2) The Legal System Committee of the Yuan reported on its examination of the draft regulations for the organization of the Central Biochemical Manufacturing and Experimental Institute. A resolution was passed approving the revised draft with amendments. (3) The Criminal Law Committee of the Yuan, in conjunction with the Economic Committee and the Finance Committee, reported on its examination of the draft regulations for revising and increasing the standards for wartime fines. A resolution was passed approving the revised draft with amendments. According to the new regulations, for fines imposed under the Criminal Law or other laws, the original amount will be increased up to one hundred times. For those who can commute a fine or be sentenced to labor, each day will be calculated as between 300 and 1,000 yuan. For those who are fined administratively, the original amount will be increased up to fifty times. If, according to Article 5 of the Administrative Execution Law, increasing the fine is still insufficient, the original amount may be increased up to fifty times. (4) The Finance Committee of the Yuan, in conjunction with the Land Law Committee, reported on its review of the proposal to abolish the Wartime Land Requisition Tax Regulations. A resolution was passed that, according to the review, the regulations should be abolished. The meeting adjourned at 5:50 PM.</p>
<p>Resolution to Submit the Kowloon and Hong Kong Phased Recovery Case for Review</p>
<p>[This Newspaper Nanjing Report, 28th] During the Legislative Yuan's regular meeting on the 28th, committee members Chen Anren and others proposed that the Yuan petition the National Government to order the diplomatic authorities to negotiate with Britain, based on the spirit of the Sino-British New Treaty, for the phased recovery of Kowloon and Hong Kong, in order to protect national sovereignty and enhance Sino-British friendship. This proposal was sent for review. A proposal to exempt export taxes, along with a draft export trade regulation, was not passed. The original proposal specified the following categories of goods for permitted export: (1) Rice, grains, wheat, flour, miscellaneous grains, and their finished products. (2) Salt. (3) All kinds of live wild birds and beasts. (4) Fowl with feathers, fowl skin with feathers, and wild bird feathers with a small amount of fowl skin. (5) Machine-woven cotton yarn and cloth. (6) Raw hides, tanned hides. (7) Fuel. (8) Iron, tin, mercury, and iron-tin ore, etc. Committee members spoke enthusiastically, believing that food and raw materials should not be exported, and that fuel was still in short supply and should be prohibited from export. They argued that if such regulations were passed, the people would inevitably suffer from hunger and cold, and that encouraging the import of all finished goods would cause prices to continue to rise. At the same time, questions were raised about the reasons for exempting import duties on items such as American cars, which were considered incomprehensible. As the import tariff regulations had not yet been finalized, it was resolved to send the matter to the Finance and Economic Committee for review together. Finally, Jian Guansan, Zhang Fengjiu, Liu Zhiping, and others made a temporary motion to "draft measures for accommodating unemployed high school graduates and request approval from the National Defense Conference," but it was not discussed due to the lateness of the hour.</p>
<h3>Alas, Great Spoils of Victory Transformed into Useless Objects; Many Captured Vehicles Received in Hunan Are Dismantled</h3>
<p>Qiu Ao Discusses Impressions of Visiting Hunan</p>
<p>[This Newspaper Hankou Report, 27th] Qiu Ao, the head of the Hunan-Hubei-Jiangxi Investigation Team, arrived in Hankou at 4:00 PM today. He met with reporters that evening to discuss his experiences and impressions from the investigation in Hunan. Qiu pointed out that one important characteristic of the corruption in Hunan's takeover process was that there were very few scholars in long gowns, but rather many soldiers in military uniforms. These takeover personnel were mostly subordinates of the former Fourth Front Army. As the troops had been transferred and deployed elsewhere, not only had the people left, but little remained, making it impossible to conduct a thorough investigation in a short period of time. He could only express his deepest regret. He then provided explanations of the cases that had already been handled: (A) The most frequent reports concerned captured vehicles. The main culprit was Shen Dake, Deputy Director of the Sichuan-Hunan Highway Bureau. He had received a total of 3,438 captured vehicles, 19,186 gallons of gasoline, and 107 tons of auto parts in Changsha. These captured military vehicles were not officially allocated to various agencies until April and May of this year. However, many important parts had been removed. In 677 vehicles, the entire engine had been completely removed, and each vehicle was missing an average of three tires. The 500 vehicles stored in Yueyang were even completely dismantled, turning the great spoils of victory into useless objects, which was truly heartbreaking. Furthermore, it was found that the official had falsely reported the number of vehicles, concealed materials and tools, and sold captured vehicles without authorization. More than 130 vehicles had already been found to have been purchased privately by businesses in addition to government agencies. He was suspected of embezzlement and corruption, and the case had been transferred to the judicial authorities for investigation and legal action. (B) Military supplies that could still be investigated were originally stored in four mixed warehouses in Changsha, Yueyang, Hengyang, and Xiangtan. These warehouses had been transferred to the Hunan Supply Office. Spot checks of the goods in each warehouse revealed that some rowing machines, printing presses, and other communication equipment had been damaged and placed in piles. Recommendations had been made to the central government to allocate these items for use in Hunan. (C) In the economic sector, in addition to reporting that Wei Yong and Yin Xing, executives of a bank, had concealed property and secretly absconded, it was also discovered that the former Fourth Front Army had received 513 dan of contraband salt from traitors, and the former 18th Army had received 50,000 shi dan of enemy salt, neither of which had been handed over to the Supply Office. These matters were being reported for review. There were two more significant cases in Changsha and Yueyang, but because the individuals and the stolen goods were at large, the court was investigating, and it was not appropriate to disclose the details at this time.</p>

<h3>US Requests Ministry of Economic Affairs to Form a Commercial Arbitration Association; British Trade Delegation to Depart for China Tomorrow</h3>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 28th] It was learned today from official sources that, at the request of the US Foreign Trade Authority, the Ministry of Economic Affairs is rapidly preparing to establish a "Chinese Commercial Arbitration Association" in order to form a joint Sino-American Commercial Arbitration Committee to resolve disputes between Chinese and American businessmen.

<h3>Editorial: The Return of the Greek King</h3>
<p>King George II of Greece left England by plane on the 27th to return to Greece and regain his throne. After World War I, the Greek king fled in 1924 when Greece declared a republic. After 11 years of wandering, he returned to the throne after a successful plebiscite. During World War II, Greece was defeated, and the king fled again. On September 1st of this year, a plebiscite showed that 75% of the population favored restoration. Now he has returned to the throne for the second time.</p>
<p>In the midst of the democratic tide of the 20th century, the majority of the Greek people actually rejected democracy and wanted a monarch. This is not because they do not love freedom, nor is it because they have a special affection for George II. Rather, it is the development of the international situation that forces them to make a choice between monarchy and democracy, or, to put it bluntly, between the two major blocs of Britain and the United States and the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Geographically, Greece is the gateway to the Balkan Peninsula and the most important key to the Aegean Sea. If the Soviet Union wants to control the Middle East and the Balkans, it must first secure the Dardanelles Strait in Turkey and second, the Aegean Sea in Greece. However, the people and governments of both countries do not sympathize with the Soviet Union. Their own strength is not enough to resist Soviet oppression. They have to rely on foreign aid, and the most reliable foreign aid is undoubtedly Britain. Because Britain's influence in the Middle East is not as great as before, and the countries of the Balkan Peninsula have completely embraced the Soviet Union, Britain has to help Turkey and Greece for its own interests. As for the United States, it has consistently supported Britain both during and after the war, and has always taken a consistent approach to the Soviet Union. Therefore, Turkey and Greece can get help from the United States by getting help from Britain.</p>
<p>Greek Prime Minister Tsaldaris saw this situation clearly long ago and has always been friendly to Britain. British troops have been stationed in Greece for two years without withdrawing, and the Greek government's army has also been constantly supplied with British arms. As for King George, he fled first to Cairo and then to London, where he enjoyed a harmonious relationship with the British government and people. If Greece does not want to be a vassal of the Soviet Union, and the Greek people do not want to accept the Soviet Union's "new-style democracy," which is the dictatorship of the Communist Party, their only way out is to court Britain diplomatically. King George II and Prime Minister Tsaldaris are of course the most appropriate representatives of this diplomatic line. Under these circumstances, 75% of the Greek voters also expressed their welcome to George II's return to the throne.</p>
<p>However, the Greek Communist Party is heartbroken by George II's victory. They tried their best to disrupt the plebiscite, but the government's strict precautions prevented them from succeeding. They immediately declared the election invalid and filed a complaint with the United Nations Security Council against Britain. At the same time, they obtained arms from the Soviet vassal Albania and Yugoslavia and launched a civil war in the northern mountains. Although the Greek government forces are now in the majority, it is still very difficult to eliminate them completely because the Communist Party has foreign aid.</p>
<p>Greek Prime Minister Tsaldaris issued a written statement to foreign journalists on the 25th, saying, in brief: "The war has been transferred from abroad to Greece in order to use the chaotic situation to obtain an outlet to the Aegean Sea. This is obvious. A foreign power is using its veto power in the United Nations Security Council to prevent the organization of an international investigation team to inspect the Greek border." At the same time, in London, a spokesman for the Greek embassy also said: "The fierce fighting in the northern mountainous areas of Greece is caused by saboteurs infiltrating from Albania and Yugoslavia." In addition, a spokesman for the British Foreign Office stated: "If the Greek police and army fail to fulfill their duties, then British troops will ultimately come out to maintain order." These three statements can explain the actual situation in Greece now and Britain's clear attitude. Even with King George II's return to the country this time, his reign is not very peaceful.</p>
<p>We believe that since the world's five great powers are now all extolling democracy, they should not interfere in the internal affairs and diplomacy of any country in the world. The majority of people in a country should have full power to decide their own political system and choose their true friends in the international community. Domestic minority political groups should also use democratic means, legal procedures, and open stances to win the trust of the people. Foreign countries should not interfere unreasonably, and opposition parties should not resort to begging for foreign aid and launching civil wars. Now that the majority of the people in Greece, more than 75%, have already made a legitimate expression, Albania and Yugoslavia have no reason to continue to support the minority and disturb the peace of the majority of the Greek people. As for the Greek Communist Party, it should not go against the will of the people and use force to seize power. Not to mention that under the current situation, the seizure will not succeed, even if it succeeds, it will eventually collapse because the majority of the people in the country refuse to support it.</p>

<h3>Greek King Returns to Native Land: Salvos Roar, Crowds Line Streets in Welcome, Civil War Fires Still Burn in Northern Mountains</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Athens, 8th] King George II of Greece, after five and a half years of exile, returned to the homeland at 8:50 this morning, landing at Phaleron Port. As the King disembarked from the destroyer, a salute of 101 guns was fired from the shore. Church bells rang throughout the nation, and the crowds roared with cheers.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent] Athens, Paris, 8th (Radio Broadcast): Escorted by a guard of honor, King George II traveled from Phaleron Port. Crowds lined the roped-off sidewalks all the way to Athens Cathedral. The small square in front of the cathedral was entirely filled, with spectators packed around the cloisters. Princess Irene and Princess Helena of Greece, attended by Mrs. Tsaermi and court ladies, stood temporarily in the cathedral's front cloister. Archbishop Damaskinos, resplendent in golden embroidered vestments, his white beard reaching his chest, slowly walked towards the cloister, holding a gold-embossed copy of the Holy Gospel. He presented it to the King, who ceremoniously kissed it. Also appearing in the cloister were resistance leaders from Crete, Macedonia, and Thessaloniki. Prominent figures from various Greek ministries, leaders of the army and navy, diplomatic corps and the heads of Allied missions, as well as representatives from organizations like the League of Red Cross Societies, gathered in the hall to offer their congratulations. Meanwhile, in the steep mountains of northern and central Greece, the fires of civil war continued to rage.</p>
<p>Five Years of Exile in London, Fond Farewell</p>
<p>[Associated Press, London, 7th] King George II of Greece flew back to his homeland today. Before leaving, he left a letter of farewell, expressing his gratitude to the British people for their hospitality during his five years of exile. The farewell letter stated, "During my time of distress, I was able to share joys and sorrows with you, hoping that your final victory would also be the liberation of my country. I first set foot on your esteemed nation at the end of 1941, and now, almost five years later, at the request of my people, I return home. I take this opportunity to bid farewell to the people and government of your nation, and to express my heartfelt thanks for their generous hospitality over the past five years."</p>
<h3>Peace Conference Committee Passes Italy-Yugoslavia Border Line: Yugoslav Representative Threatens to Refuse Signing Peace Treaty, Trieste Communists Hold Large-Scale Demonstration</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent] Paris, 8th (Radio Broadcast): Yugoslavia had previously stated that it would refuse to sign the peace treaty with Italy unless it obtained the entire Venezia Giulia peninsula. The Peace Conference's Political Committee on Italy today passed, by a vote of twelve to five, the Four Powers' proposal using the "French Line" as the Italy-Yugoslavia border, with three abstentions. The Yugoslav representative's opposition was unsuccessful, and the Yugoslav representative threatened on the spot to refuse to sign the peace treaty and to have Yugoslav troops refuse to withdraw from Trieste. The Soviet bloc countries supported them. According to the "French Line," the peninsula would be divided in two, with three-quarters annexed to Yugoslavia, and the remaining one-quarter narrow strip designated to Italy, surrounding the free port of Trieste.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent] Paris, 8th (Radio Broadcast): Trieste – The question of the status of the free zone of the Port of Trieste continues to cause discontent among the people of Venezia Giulia. Local Communists held a large-scale demonstration last night. The demonstrators stated that they would strive to make the port of Trieste genuinely democratic and oppose all attempts to turn it into a colony. Similar demonstrations occurred in Gorizia, where police intervention was ineffective.</p>

<h3>Britain and the United States Propose New Suggestion to Convene Danube River Conference to Establish International Control System: Soviet Union Opposes, Attempting to Monopolize Shipping</h3>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 27th] Britain recently presented a new proposal at the Paris Peace Conference, advocating for the convening of an international conference to discuss the Danube River issue. The conference should be attended by countries along the Danube River and the major powers and should establish an organization for the international control of the Danube River. It is reported that the United States has expressed support for this proposal, but the Soviet Union opposes this view, advocating that the countries along the Danube River should exclusively control the Danube River, excluding other major powers from controlling the river. The Soviet Union considers itself one of the countries along the Danube River.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Lake Success, New York, 8th] Today, at the United Nations Economic and Social Council, the Soviet representative accused the United States of directly interfering in the internal affairs of countries related to Danube River navigation and condemned the U.S. occupying forces for detaining Czechoslovakian ships and refusing to return them, attempting to exert pressure on the two countries in order to achieve its goals in Southeastern Europe. Previously, representatives of Yugoslavia and Czechoslovakia suggested to the Economic and Social Council that the United States should return 214 ships detained by the U.S. authorities in the U.S. occupied zones of Germany and Austria. U.S. representative Winant immediately proposed to the Council that the Soviet Union, the United States, and Southeastern European countries hold a meeting in Vienna by November 1 to resolve the current obstacles to restoring international navigation on the Danube River. The Soviet representative then made this explosive statement, directly accusing the United States of attempting to interfere in the internal affairs of various countries.</p>

<h3>Joint Defense of Straits Rejected by Turkey: Soviet Union Launches Propaganda Offensive, Accusing Turkey of Being Manipulated by Britain and the United States</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, London, 28th] The Soviet Union announced today that Turkey, in its note of August 24, "did not refute" the accusation that it had allowed the Axis powers to use the Dardanelles Strait, which is under Turkish administration, for war purposes. TASS reported that the Soviet government formally announced that Turkey had rejected two Soviet proposals: one for the Black Sea countries to conclude a treaty to replace the Montreux Convention, and the other for a joint Soviet-Turkish defense of the straits, on the grounds that this would "contradict Turkish sovereignty."</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Moscow, 8th] Last night, Soviet radio broadcast an appeal to the Turkish people, accusing Turkish reactionaries of being manipulated by British and American imperialism. It stated that Turkish newspapers and radio stations ignore Marshal Stalin's call for peace and continue to portray the international situation as extremely bleak. This strategy is intended to conceal the domestic situation and willingly be manipulated by foreign imperialists. These imperialists are attempting to gain ground in Turkey. In addition to obtaining various bases near the Turkish Straits, Britain has also dispatched more than 5,000 experts to Turkish military academies to carry out activities.</p>

The policeman replied, "It's none of my business, I'm here to greet the Minister." The onlookers informed him that the assailant was the Minister.

<h3>Issue of Repatriation of Japanese Nationals from Soviet Territory: U.S. and Soviet Representatives to Resume Negotiations</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Tokyo, 8th] A spokesperson for General MacArthur's headquarters recently announced that General MacArthur will conduct negotiations with Soviet General Derevyanko, the Soviet representative to the Allied Council for Japan, regarding the repatriation of Japanese prisoners of war and civilians from Soviet territory. General Derevyanko informed headquarters that he had been ordered by his government to be responsible for commencing negotiations with General MacArthur. Negotiations for the repatriation of Japanese nationals were previously held in June but were terminated in July due to a deadlock. At that time, General Derevyanko stated that he was only responsible for discussing the repatriation of Japanese nationals from northern Korea and certain regions of the three eastern provinces of China. The hundreds of thousands of Japanese prisoners detained in the Soviet Union proper were not within the scope of discussion. However, the current negotiations will include all Japanese prisoners in the Soviet Union proper, Sakhalin, and the Kuril Islands. It is reported that General Derevyanko's representatives and General MacArthur's representatives will soon begin discussing the details of the negotiations. According to reliable sources, the Soviet Union plans to repatriate Japanese nationals from ports in eastern Siberia starting in October, at a rate of 10,000 to 15,000 per month, and from ports in southern Sakhalin, at a rate of 7,000 to 10,000 per month.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Tokyo, 8th] The Japanese Parliament will convene today and propose a resolution calling for the accelerated repatriation of Japanese military personnel and civilians in Soviet territory. Female staff members from various parties will support this resolution and deliver speeches.</p>

<h3>Chinese Representatives Arrive in Moscow to Attend World Telecommunications Conference</h3>

<h3>Paris Indian Government Representatives Hold Secret Negotiations with Soviet Union</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent] Paris, 8th (Radio Broadcast): Representatives of the Indian Provisional Government are holding secret negotiations with Soviet representatives in Paris. Due to the confidential nature of the matter, the content of the talks has not been announced. British representatives are very concerned about this. The Indian representatives are scheduled to return home tomorrow to report to Nehru.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Moscow, 27th] "Izvestia" commented on the establishment of the Indian Provisional Government, stating that Britain asked Nehru to form the Indian Provisional Government in order to shift the responsibility for the country's economic crisis and ethnic strife onto the shoulders of the Congress Party. This move can be seen as a concession by the British to the Indian national movement. The members of the Indian government are different from the executive members of the Indian Governor, but since the leaders of the Congress Party have accepted the responsibility of governing, they will have to accept considerable limitations on their original demands. As the new government is not responsible to the Indian legislature, and the British army has not expressed any intention of withdrawing from India, and the British side has reaffirmed that the previous constitutional status remains unchanged, this is Britain's trick to exchange small favors for large benefits.</p>
<h3>A Comparison of the Paris Peace Conferences of 1919 and 1946 (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Lu Yu</p>
<p>(4) Differences in Organization</p>
<p>In terms of organizational structure, there are four major differences between the previous peace conference and this one. I will elaborate on them separately: First, the subordinate system of the peace conference - as mentioned earlier, the 1919 peace conference was vested with full power to handle the Treaty of Versailles with Germany. Therefore, the peace conference at that time was a supreme power organ, with no higher-level agency above it. This peace conference is only of an advisory nature. Above it is the Council of Foreign Ministers of the Four Powers. Most of the proposals discussed by the peace conference are proposed by the Council of Foreign Ministers of the Four Powers, and the resolutions passed by the peace conference still need to be finally reviewed by the Council of Foreign Ministers of the Four Powers. Second, the relationship between the peace conference and international peace organizations - when the previous peace conference opened, the League of Nations had not yet been established. The League of Nations was a product of the Treaty of Versailles passed by the Paris Peace Conference. Therefore, there was a peace conference first, and then the League of Nations. When this peace conference was convened, the United Nations already existed and had already begun its activities. The design of the United Nations was far before the end of the war, so its creation has nothing to do with the peace conference. Third, the internal organization of the peace conference - the internal organizational structure of the previous peace conference can be described in four words: "a conference within a conference." Above the plenary session (attended by all participating countries) was the "Council of Ten" (composed of the US President and Secretary of State and the Prime Ministers and Foreign Ministers of Britain, France, Italy, and Japan). Above the "Council of Ten" was the "Council of Four" (composed of the leaders of the US, Britain, France, and Italy). After Italian representative Orlando angrily left Paris over the Fiume issue, the "Council of Four" was changed to the "Council of Three." These three heads of state were US President Wilson, British Prime Minister Lloyd George, and French Prime Minister Clemenceau. This council was the agency with the power to "have the last word" in the peace conference and was held in extreme secrecy. In addition, the daily affairs and review work of the peace conference were the responsibility of the designated 58 subcommittees. The organizational structure of this peace conference is much simpler than that of the 1919 peace conference. It is divided into only three parts: the plenary session, the subcommittees, and the secretariat. The plenary session decides on various issues and submits them to the relevant subcommittees for research. The subcommittees then submit reports on the issues submitted by the plenary session and provide various opinions for the plenary session to adopt. The number of subcommittees is also far fewer than the number established by the previous peace conference, with only nine: (1) Political Committee for the Treaty with Italy, (2) Political Committee for the Treaty with Romania, (3) Political Committee for the Treaty with Bulgaria, (4) Political Committee for the Treaty with Hungary, (5) Political Committee for the Treaty with Finland, (6) Economic Committee for the Treaty with Italy, (7) Economic Committee for the Treaties with Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary, and Finland, (8) Military Committee for the Treaties with Italy, Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary, and Finland, (9) Legal Committee. In addition to the above-mentioned nine special committees, the conference also established an integrated committee, with the participation of all member states, whose task was to coordinate the work of other committees. However, although this peace conference does not have the phenomenon of "a conference within a conference," it has the characteristic of "a conference outside the conference," which is the aforementioned Council of Foreign Ministers of the Four Powers. Fourth, the attitude of the peace conference towards the defeated countries - the attitude of the 1919 peace conference towards the defeated country - Germany - was extremely severe. It was not allowed to attend the meeting and speak, and it was forced to accept the treaty unconditionally. This peace conference is different. It invited the five former enemy countries - Italy, Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary, and Finland - to attend the plenary session and subcommittees of the peace conference and allowed them to express their opinions orally or submit requests in writing. This attitude of treating the defeated countries with leniency is worthy of praise. This change may be due to the fact that today is an era of democracy, and a treaty monopolized by the victorious countries may be criticized by democratic and freedom-loving people around the world, or it may be because the current international situation is more tense and subtle than in 1919, and the major powers are trying to use or win over the former enemy countries to increase the power of their own group.</p>

<h3>Endangering the Livelihoods of the Southeastern Half of the Country: Chuan Shishuo Sentenced to Death: Heard the Verdict with Tears in His Eyes, Wife and Daughters Faced Him in Sorrow: Li Zulie Sentenced to Five Years in Prison</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent] Chuan Shishuo, one of the top figures in the puppet government, was sentenced to death by the High Court yesterday, deprived of all civil rights for life. In summary, the defendant initially participated in the establishment of the puppet national government due to weak will and then served as the puppet Minister of Railways and Construction. Later, as the puppet Governor of Zhejiang Province, he implemented the "Rural Clearing Campaign," endangering the livelihoods of the southeastern half of the country. In summary, his actions were unforgivable, so he was sentenced to death as a warning to others. Chuan was wearing a gray robe and leather shoes, his spirits were failing, and his face changed when he heard the verdict. He almost shed tears. The presiding judge explained the main points of the verdict, stating that the defendant's entire property, except for a reasonable amount for the necessary living expenses of his family, would be confiscated. The presiding judge informed him that if he did not agree with the verdict, he could apply to the Supreme Court for a retrial within ten days of receiving the verdict, otherwise the court would request it on his behalf. Fu did not say much, only requesting the court to allow him to speak with his family for a few words in a broken, tearful voice. The presiding judge replied that today's time was tight, and he could meet them in prison another day. After saying that, he was ordered to be taken back into custody. His wife and daughters followed behind him, tearful and miserable. His daughter even whispered "Dad," and Chuan looked at them with tearful eyes, filled with endless sadness.</p>
<p>In addition, Li Fulai, deputy manager of the Shanghai branch of the puppet Bank of China and chairman of the Fulai Money Exchange, was sentenced to five years of imprisonment, deprived of civil rights for five years, and his entire property, except for a reasonable amount for the necessary living expenses of his family, was confiscated. When Li heard the verdict, he immediately asked the court, "Is the sentence for the crime of disrupting the financial system? Or another crime?" The presiding judge replied, "Conspiring with an enemy country to plot to revolt against one's own country." After the court allowed him to speak with his family for a few words, he was taken back to prison by the bailiffs.</p>

<h3>Another Puppet Government Bigwig, Chen Chunpu, Case Concluded: Claims During "Governorship" He Was Merely "House Sitting," Clever Arguments Too Late to Regret</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent] After Chuan Shishuo was sentenced to death by the High Court yesterday, on the same day, another puppet government bigwig, Chen Chunpu, had his case concluded by the High Court, with the verdict scheduled for October 4.</p>
<p>Chen is currently 47 years old, from Xinhui, Guangdong. He is related to the inner circle of Wang Jingwei and is the leader of the "Public House Faction." He was originally a member of the Kuomintang and served in various party and government agencies for a long time. Later, he became the chairman of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Committee and the director of the Overseas Chinese Education Office. When the Sino-Japanese War broke out, Wang Jingwei colluded with the Japanese invaders, betrayed the country and sought peace. Chen defected in secret and left Chongqing in December of the 27th year of the Republic [1938]. Later, Wang Jingwei negotiated a "Basic Peace Program" with the enemy invaders in Shanghai and prepared to organize a puppet government. Chen was summoned to serve as his private secretary, following him closely. After the negotiations were concluded, they jointly usurped Nanjing, established a puppet regime under the wings of the Japanese invaders and Wang Jingwei. In March of the 29th year of the Republic [1940], he took office as the Secretary-General of the Puppet Executive Yuan, concurrently serving as the Deputy Secretary-General of the Puppet Political Committee and the Executive Committee member and Deputy Secretary-General of the Puppet Central Executive Committee. In October of the 31st year of the Republic [1942], he was transferred to the Minister of the Puppet Construction Department. In the 32nd year of the Republic [1943], he concurrently served as the Minister of the Puppet Central Party Department's Organization Department. In April of the 33rd year of the Republic [1944], he was transferred to the Governor of Guangdong Province and concurrently served as the Director of the Puppet Guangdong Pacification Office. He was dismissed in February of the 34th year of the Republic [1945] and appointed as a member of the Puppet National Government until the victory. After the victory, he was arrested and prosecuted by the High Prosecutor's Office.</p>
<p>Chen, dressed in a blue-gray long gown and wearing rimless glasses, defended himself on several points: (1) In December of the 27th year of the Republic [1938], he accompanied Wang's children to Hong Kong to study and was not colluding in advance to betray the country by leaving Chongqing first. (2) He did not know anything about the published "Yan Telegram". He only learned about it in the newspapers in Hong Kong afterward. (3) As Wang's private secretary, he only managed the affairs within the official residence. The political telegrams and document exchanges were handled by another confidential secretary. (4) He did not participate in the "Nanjing Talks", "Xu Island Talks", signing the "Sino-Japanese Basic Treaty", "Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty", publishing the "Sino-Japanese-Manchukuo Declaration", or the "Declaration of War against Britain and the United States". He never followed Wang on his many trips to Japan. As for whether the defendant participated in the "Qingdao Talks" and "Nanjing Talks", Tao Xisheng and Gao Zongwu can be questioned to provide proof. (5) The positions of Puppet Deputy Secretary-General and other positions were mostly nominal. All matters were handled by the Puppet Secretary-General. (6) During his tenure in the Puppet Construction Department, he never signed any clauses that lost sovereignty. On the contrary, he built water conservancy projects, such as projects. (7) His time as the puppet Governor of Guangdong Province was only eight months, and it was all "house sitting" in nature, similar to a puppet. However, he worked hard to suppress food prices, improve people's livelihoods, and the price of rice in Guangdong was the lowest in the occupied areas at that time. (8) Over the years, he has strictly prohibited gambling, eradicated opium seedlings, organized winter relief, and subsidized charitable undertakings, all of which he believes are beneficial to the country and the people, and he also raised more than 4 million in patriotic bonds before leaving Chongqing. (9) The term "Public House Faction" was coined by the Japanese to create division. In reality, it does not exist. He also stated two points: (1) In the 27th year of the Republic [1938], he lost his party membership because he did not participate in the general registration of party members. (2) On September 17 of the 34th year of the Republic [1945], he declared to the Central Statistics Bureau that he had lost his footing for a while. He was determined to resign and only held an empty title of Puppet National Government member.</p>

<h3>Xie Xiao Requests Mercy, Leave Some Reputation</h3>
<p>On the same day, several other cases were investigated: Xie Xiaochu, general manager of Zhonghua Chemical Company, was accused of serving as the chairman of the Shanghai Chemical Raw Materials Trade Association and a standing committee member of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce. Yesterday, Ye Xuesong, Fang Zifan, Wu Wenqing, Shen Songxi, and others were summoned to testify. When questioned, the defendant claimed that in order to maintain his industry, he organized the trade association, otherwise he would not be allowed to operate. This was all out of necessity, as evidenced by the acquittal of the former chairman of the Shanghai Wooden Clothes Trade Association. He now only hopes that the court will show mercy and leave him some reputation so that he can do something again when he gets out, otherwise he will not be able to survive. The court hearing was adjourned for further questioning.</p>
<p>In addition, Fan Qizhu Yongnian was accused of using hardware and grain to support the enemy. Wang Zhenchuan, who once served as the chief of the Suzhou Tax Bureau's branch office, was also investigated once, and the court hearing was adjourned for further questioning.</p>
<h3>Special Commissioner for Opium Suppression in Jiangsu and Shanghai, Liu Xuehai, Arrives in Shanghai for Supervision and Guidance</h3>
<p>In order to thoroughly eradicate opium, the Ministry of the Interior has divided the recovered areas of North and Central China, which were most deeply poisoned by the enemy, into six districts and dispatched special commissioners to supervise and assess the anti-opium administration in various places, and to assist local authorities in promoting anti-drug work. Liu Xuehai, the special commissioner for opium suppression in Jiangsu and Shanghai, arrived in Shanghai yesterday with several supervising commissioners to begin work. His office is located in the Lujiawan Branch Bureau. Mr. Liu told reporters yesterday that there are only more than 6,000 registered opium smokers in Shanghai, but according to the lowest estimate, there are at least about 100,000 people. Mr. Liu and others will stay in Shanghai for another ten days or so before going to Zhenjiang and other places for inspection.</p>
<h3>City Council Petition Delegation to Nanjing Seeks Opinions from Industry and Commerce Yesterday's Meeting Gathered More Than 100 People The National Federation of Industry and Commerce Will Be Established in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Luo Qinghua, standing director of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and secretary-general of the Preparatory Committee of the National Federation of Industry and Commerce, is about to represent the City Council to petition the government, requesting the government to provide practical relief and support to the Shanghai industry and commerce, which is on the verge of collapse. He especially invited people from the industry and commerce community in the city to express their opinions at the Municipal Chamber of Commerce at 4:30 p.m. yesterday, so as to forward them to the authorities for reference. More than 100 celebrities from the industry and commerce community attended. Mr. Luo first delivered a speech, stating that the future of Shanghai industry and commerce is precarious. Two months ago, the Chamber of Commerce organized an industry and commerce petition led by Mr. Liu to go to Nanjing to petition the central government, but it did not achieve the main point. In mid-August, the government adjusted the exchange rate, intending to support industry and commerce, but because the industry and commerce community is deeply and heavily troubled, this measure is not enough. It is expected that there will be major changes in China's political economy in one or two months, because the National Assembly is scheduled to be convened on November 12 of this year. The government is determined to implement constitutional government and return power to the people. At that time, it is expected that a new economic policy will be established, which will help the development of industry and commerce. The Shanghai City Council has many suggestions on the government's economic and financial policies, and it has also decided to recommend eleven councilors to represent the city to petition in Nanjing. The petition delegation is scheduled to depart on the 30th, and will meet with the Chairman and make specific suggestions to the competent authorities, in order to save the industry and commerce, which is as dangerous as eggs piled up. Then, Mr. Luo presented a report on the preparation of the National Federation of Industry and Commerce, and predicted that the headquarters of the association would be established in Shanghai in the future. At that time, Shanghai's position in the national industry and commerce will be even more important. Finally, he asked the participants to express their opinions. Shou Jingwei, director of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, first stood up and gave a brief report on the situation of the previous industry and commerce petition delegation, and congratulated the success of this City Council petition delegation. Then, Pan Shihao, Yu Huancheng, Xie Hengcong and others made speeches one after another. Mr. Pan predicted that this petition by the City Council representing public opinion will be more fruitful than the previous one. He said that the Chairman is now in Nanjing, and the Chairman loves the country and the people, and values public opinion most. He is expected to adopt many specific suggestions from public opinion institutions. Mr. Yu strongly stated that the government should firmly support industry and commerce and encourage production, and said that the biggest pain of the industry and commerce community recently is being oppressed by high interest rates. Under the current situation of "currency inflation and credit tightening", they cannot breathe, which has led to high prices and industrial and commercial decline. To save this situation, it is necessary to "tighten the currency and expand credit". His words were very insightful, and the whole audience responded with warm applause. The meeting adjourned at about 6 p.m.</p>
<h3>The First Group of the Investigation Team The Work Report Will Be Published Soon The Naval Headquarters Occupies School Buildings Negotiations for Relocation Have Not Yet Yielded Results</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] The first group of the investigation team for receiving and handling enemy and puppet materials in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui is about to end and will publish a work report. Due to insufficient personnel, short time, and the fact that the investigation period was quite a long time from the receiving period, and the records were incomplete, the work could not be completed thoroughly. Group Leader Zhang told this reporter his thoughts on the work of the investigation team, saying: Investigation work is about getting to the bottom of things, but there is a bottom below the bottom, and there is a seabed outside the riverbed. The authorities' misguided policies, disorganized organization, and slow handling are the "riverbed" found by the investigation team; while the lack of political ideas and weak legal concepts of the administrators are the "seabed". Only those with ideas have faith and can earnestly fulfill the Three Principles of the People. Having a legal concept will prevent illegal behavior. The greatest significance of the work of the investigation team is to correct the policies of the administrative authorities and change the social atmosphere.</p>

After the victory, he was a military police officer in the U.S. Army Corps, and is now a construction broker. His wife, Inusova, 45 years old, has been married for nine years. Their relationship is weak and quarrels often occur. At about 3:30 p.m. yesterday, Durminov suddenly went to the Changshu Road Police Station to report that his wife, Inusova, had been assassinated and killed. The head of the Zhao Branch Bureau, Wang Duanhong, the chief of the criminal section, and member Da Cheng rushed to investigate. They saw the deceased lying in a pool of blood on the floor of the pavilion, with a knife in the head, a knife in the left back of the neck, and a knife in the left eyebrow corner. The trachea had been cut. Not long after, the Foreign Affairs Section of the General Bureau also sent personnel to the scene, and Quan Tao, the chief clerk of the District Procuratorate, also led a forensic doctor to conduct an examination. After a long period of research by the police, they discovered that the husband was highly suspected: (1) According to his statement, he went out at 9 a.m., but according to a Westerner across the street, he was still pacing in the room at 10:30 a.m. (2) At about 10 a.m., a Russian living with him heard a cry for help downstairs. He ordered Ama to come down to ask what was going on, and the agent replied that nothing was wrong. (3) The night before last, they had an argument over keeping a cat, and the quarrel could be heard outdoors. A careful examination revealed that the blood on the floor had congealed into blood clots, which was definitely not the case if the murder had occurred in the afternoon. Later, a kitchen knife used in the murder was found in the drawer in the bathroom. Although it was extremely sharp, there was no blood stain, and there was a water stain, indicating that it had been washed after use. The furniture, tables, and chairs in the room were messy.

<h3>Rayon Yarn and Gauze Prices Soar. Minister Wang Discusses Measures to Suppress Prices.</h3>
<p>Necessary Steps Will Be Taken If Necessary. About 5,000 Bales of Yarn Are Shipped South Each Month (Equivalent in Cloth)</p>
<p>[Reported by Our Newspaper] After arriving in Shanghai yesterday morning, Minister Wang of the Ministry of Economic Affairs attended and presided over the regular board meeting of the Textile Construction Company in the afternoon at 3:00 PM. After the meeting, he met with reporters and said: The recent soaring of yarn prices is not right, and the government is determined to find ways to suppress them. Although the cost of imported raw cotton has increased since the adjustment of foreign exchange rates, the domestic inventory is very substantial, so it should not have a major impact. In the past month, the joint distribution committee of national and private yarn mills has been able to fulfill its duties in the joint distribution of cotton yarn. However, after the Mid-Autumn Festival, due to the soaring of the US dollar in Shanghai and the booming sales of cloth, the black market price of yarn has also gradually increased, forcing the joint distribution committee to moderately increase the selling price. However, it is still hoped that the mills will show more sacrifice spirit and support the government's determination to suppress prices, and jointly maintain affordable yarn prices. At the same time, it is hoped that industry and commerce will provide more assistance to the government's price stabilization policy. Otherwise, the government will have to take necessary steps. He said: The Textile Industry Management Committee meeting to be held today will discuss measures to suppress yarn prices with private yarn mills. As for the management measures for the shipment of yarn and cloth to the south, they are currently awaiting promulgation after being approved by the Executive Yuan. According to investigations and statistics, the amount of yarn and cloth shipped to the south is expected to be 3,000 bales of yarn and 2,000 bales of cloth (equivalent) per month, totaling 5,000 bales. Therefore, the amount is very limited, and the shipment will not affect yarn prices in this city. Regarding the purchase of new cotton loans, the Four Joint Offices have already approved the loan pledge method, which shows the government's determination to provide support. The collective system will not be used for the procurement method for now, but it is hoped that the purchase price will be consistent. Minister Wang also expressed great concern about the continuous rise in the price of rayon in this city, but said that once Japanese rayon arrives in Shanghai, the market price can be suppressed, and speculators will eventually suffer the consequences. He has confirmed that Ouyang Lun will be appointed as the director of the Industry and Commerce Supervision Office, which is expected to be established next month. Minister Wang is scheduled to return to Nanjing by evening train tonight.</p>
<h3>Yarn Prices Jump by 500,000, and Cotton Cloth Also Soars, Rising Nearly 10,000 Yuan</h3>
<p>[Reported by Our Newspaper] The violent rise in yarn prices yesterday was the only seen since the victory. At the beginning of the morning, 20-count yarn immediately rose by 200,000 yuan. However, buyers were not discouraged and absorbed it at a higher price. In no time, it rose another 100,000 yuan. The rise in fine yarn and 42-count double-strand yarn was even more severe. Under the competition of merchants and weaving factories, it also jumped by 300,000 to 500,000 yuan. The reasons are nothing more than the following: (1) Autumn sales are booming, and there is a shortage of spot goods. (2) The distribution quotas of Textile Construction and private mills are very limited and are futures, so actual users suffer from the fact that distant water cannot quench the immediate thirst, and they have to search for spot goods in the market. (3) The shipment of yarn and cloth to the south is about to open, and Guangdong merchants are resuming purchases. (4) The turnover of Yingkou and Tianjin in the north is rising sharply and cannot be stopped. (5) Hot money is mixed into the yarn and cloth market, buying and hoarding at a higher price, so that futures warehouse receipts flow into the hands of these people, and the chips become even more scarce. (6) The flexible increase in the distribution price of the Joint Distribution Committee and the rise in the price of the yarn market are mutually causal. In short, spot goods are exhausted, and demand exceeds supply. To suppress yarn prices, apart from the large-scale supply of spot goods, it is really a waste of time to rely solely on the distribution of futures. In summary, the initial price of 20-count double-strand yarn was 2 million, and the final price was 2.22 million. The prices of other brands such as Ren Zhong, Tian Nu, Jin Ji, and Da Fa were similar. The price of 42-count yarn was 3.2 million to 3.35 million yuan, which was 300,000 to 500,000 yuan higher than yesterday's price. The cloth market was originally stable, and the opening price in the morning was similar to the previous day. Near noon, due to the aggressive advance of the northern merchants in white goods and the surge in yarn prices, the market was moved to absorb, and the price rose by 5,000 to 10,000 yuan compared to the morning. The initial price of unlicensed colored balls in the morning was 80,000, and the price at noon was 88,000. Xin Yang He rose from 82,000 to 92,000. Shuiyue Shilin rose from more than 120,000 yuan to nearly 140,000 yuan. Yuan Biji increased by 5,000 to 6,000 yuan, totaling 104,000 yuan for Jinlian Miaowu and 108,000 yuan for Sijunzi Baiyin. In general, the market is still expected to rise.</p>
<h3>Off-Exchange Trading: Small Foreign Stocks Rise Slightly, Public Bonds Trading Scarce</h3>
<p>Small foreign stocks rose slightly, while large stocks, except for Jardine Matheson, remained flat. Ewo Yarns fell slightly from 9,300 yuan to 9,000 yuan, and British-American Tobacco rose slightly from 10,300 yuan to 10,600 yuan. As a result, the closing prices were generally flat compared to the previous day. Ewo Yarns, Steel, and Ewo Beer rose slightly, British-American Tobacco fell slightly, and Jardine Matheson, Paper, and Shipping each rose by more than half a percent. Public bond trading remained scarce, and the market was still slightly affected by the small amount of funds released by the financial community. It lacked the momentum to rise. Unified C opened at 1,830 yuan, and the low price was no more than 1,800 yuan. It once rose to 1,900 yuan in the middle of the day, and finally hovered around 1,850 yuan, resulting in a rise of 30 yuan compared to the previous closing. A and B rose by 50 yuan, D rose by 20 yuan, and Unified E also rose by 20 yuan. The transaction volume was no more than 3 million yuan in face value.</p>
<h3>Excellent Results of German Cotton, Purchase Price Increased by 20-30%</h3>
<p>This spring, the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry negotiated with the Joint Office to import 225 tons of American purebred German cotton seeds, which were handed over to the Shanghai Cotton Production Improvement Office for management and distribution to Jiangsu, Hubei, Anhui, Jiangxi, Zhejiang, and other provinces in the Yangtze River Basin for supervised planting. According to reports from all parties, due to its pure and good breeding, vigorous growth, and abundant yield, the new cotton samples of this year have been transported to Shanghai for inspection. The lint is soft, even, and white, and the fibers are fine and long, with an average length of more than one and a quarter inches, and the longest reaching one and three-eighths inches, which is excellent. Shanghai yarn mills are competing to purchase it, and the purchase price of German cotton has been agreed upon by both parties to be 20% higher than the market price of seed cotton and 30% higher than the price of lint cotton as an incentive. A large amount of this high-quality new cotton will arrive in the Shanghai market in mid-next month.</p>
<h3>Tea Production Loan, Total Amount is 10 Billion, Monthly Interest Rate Agreed to be 3%</h3>

<h3>Rayon Price Increase Not Yet Over, Factory-Processed Silk and Satin Goods Follow Suit</h3>
<p>The rayon price increase has not yet subsided. At the Guangyou on the 120th Sky Bridge yesterday morning, the opening price was 5.2 million yuan, and the maximum was shouted to 400,000 yuan, but it eventually fell due to the high price and lack of interest. Transactions were made as low as 120,000 yuan, and the closing price in the morning was 5.1 million yuan. In the afternoon, due to a small amount of absorption by actual sales users, it was revived, raising the price to 300,000 yuan, which was more than 200,000 yuan higher than the previous day. 75% semi-gloss, with a lot of goods and sluggish sales, the price was not good. Factory-processed transactions were very lively, and the selling price was uniformly raised. 78-80% uniformity B-grade was 4.025 million yuan yesterday, and ordinary goods were also 3.9 million to 3.95 million yuan, which was about 200,000 yuan higher than the previous day. Silk and satin goods, especially bedding fabrics, were the most popular, and the price was more than 100,000 yuan higher yesterday. The prices of other goods generally increased.</p>
<h3>White Coal Rises Slightly</h3>
<p>Due to the news that the Coal Business United Business Office will distribute Hongji lump coal, coal merchants are taking a wait-and-see attitude, and the market is gradually loosening. The prices of all goods have increased slightly.</p>
<h3>Flour Price Not to Exceed 14,000</h3>
<p>[Reported by Our Newspaper] Because flour is a daily necessity for citizens, the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs has stipulated that the price of each bag is 14,000 yuan and warned the Flour Industry Association not to raise the price without authorization. However, in recent days, the retail price of flour from Lao Che Pai, Pao Che Pai, and Bing Chuan Pai has risen to 16,000 to 17,000 yuan per bag. The municipal government has specially ordered the Bureau of Social Affairs and the Police Bureau to investigate strictly and urge the flour industry to restore the selling price of 14,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Foreign Affairs Requests Restoration of Visa Commissioner in Hong Kong</h3>

<h3>Soviet Colored Cotton, Egypt Sends Personnel for Inspection</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Cairo, 27th] An Egyptian delegation will soon depart for the Soviet Union to study colored cotton planting methods and intends to purchase seeds for trial planting in Egypt. At the same time, according to a New York dispatch, U.S. officials consider Soviet claims that red, green, and brown cotton can be sold well in the market to be exaggerated. It is claimed that the U.S. grown brown and green cotton varieties have no commercial value because the fiber quality of naturally colored cotton is poor and it fades easily.</p>
<h3>Rationing of Taiwanese Rice Continues; Xian and Geng Rice Show Slight Decline</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the rice market calmed as the weather cleared up. High-grade Xian rice dropped 1,000 yuan, while mid- to low-grade varieties fell by over 1,000 yuan. Bai Yuan rice remained sluggish. Newly harvested Geng rice prices stabilized initially, then weakened, while aged Geng rice continued to decline. Rationing of Taiwanese rice continued with 7,050 bags allocated in the southern city at a price of 53,000 yuan per bag. Flour prices remained firm, and bran prices were stable. Wheat from both northern and southern ports remained stagnant with limited transactions, falling by a further 300-400 yuan. Soybeans continued their trend of high prices followed by declines. The supply of broad beans became increasingly scarce with limited stock in the producing regions, leading to continued price increases of 2,000-3,000 yuan. Corn prices were flat, and red sorghum remained similar. Raw peanuts from the southern ports remained unchanged, and the market was temporarily stable. Oil prices were under pressure due to continued arrivals from Qingdao, with raw oil prices falling by 1,000 yuan. Soybean oil also weakened, and rapeseed oil followed suit, dropping by 500-600 yuan. Soybean cake weakened by 100 yuan.</p>
<h3>Speculative Funds Focus on Chinese Stocks; Market Sentiment Improves</h3>
<p>Chinese stocks opened higher this morning due to the scrutiny of gold and foreign currency transactions, leading to an influx of speculative funds. All stocks opened higher. Yong Yarn soared by half a percent due to speculation. However, this rise was considered too rapid, and prices retreated after opening, triggering selling pressure. Fortunately, diverse buyers continued to arrive. The trading floor helped absorb large volumes of distressed shares, providing support despite unfavorable conditions. Many securities firms sold Yong Yarn to purchase American Asia stocks. As a result, American Asia performed better than Yong Yarn, bolstered by silk yarn prices. Except for Qinxing, which fell to its previous closing price, other stocks declined but remained significantly higher than their previous closings, alleviating the dire situation. Buying interest intensified after 11:00 AM, leading to a rebound. The two leading stocks spurred each other on, generating significant excitement. The three smaller hot stocks were neglected and underperformed. Near noon, the hot stocks rose before quickly falling, with the three smaller stocks falling faster. Near closing, the market became choppy. Yong Yarn closed up just over half a percent, while American Asia was down slightly. The three smaller hot stocks saw minimal gains. Among the cold stocks, cement prices remained flat, while Tongyi, Xinyi, Rongfeng, Huafeng, and Wushe Silk Company each rose by about half a percent. Other stocks saw limited gains, with Datong and Li'an rising by one percent. The total trading volume was over 13.58 million shares. Off-exchange stocks saw only slight gains.</p>
<h3>Rationing of Cotton and Sugar; Divided into No. 1 and No. 2 Grades; Approximately 20,000 Bags</h3>

It is reported that there are approximately 20,000 bags in stock, with each bag weighing 120 jin (approximately 60 kg).</p>
<h3>China Sugar Warehouse Receipts; Have Fallen Below Rationing Price</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market trend remained weak, continuing to decline. The current price for the association's allocated spot goods was only 130,000 yuan, the same as the rationing price. This incurs additional expenses and interest. If the goods were purchased previously, losses would amount to 10,000 yuan. Warehouse receipts fell below the current rationing price by 4,000 yuan, reaching only 126,000 yuan. Raw sugar was priced at 115,000 yuan, down slightly. Jian's group offered 60-70 bags of Diaoging sugar at a price of 100,800 yuan. It is reported that the Taiwan Sugar Corporation is scheduled to auction off sugar from vehicles next Monday. A full carload of white sugar is valued at 180,000 yuan, and a half carload is valued at 160,000 yuan, indicating that the market price is moving towards a more stable value.</p>

<h3>Audit Comes to an End; Gold and Foreign Currency Rise Slowly</h3>

<h3>The Theme of "Unofficial History of the Qing Palace"</h3>
<p>— Tao Xiong</p>
<p>"Unofficial History of the Qing Palace" depicts the corruption of the Qing imperial system, the autocracy of Empress Dowager Cixi, the weakness of Emperor Guangxu, and the despotism, baseness, and shamelessness of Li Lianying. It allows us to see that the loss of sovereignty and national humiliation of China in the last hundred years, as well as the bold aggression of imperialists, were all caused by these three people!</p>
<p>If Emperor Guangxu had not been so weak and had been a decisive person, China would not have been reduced to its current state, and Japanese imperialists would not have dared to have the idea of annexing China.</p>
<p>If Empress Dowager Cixi had not been so autocratic, and had not based everything on personal considerations, but had instead prioritized the nation and its people, allowing Emperor Guangxu to fight Japan, and resolving the matter in Korea, Japan would not have dared to despise China so much! Then, the modern history of China would not be so terrible as it is now!</p>
<p>Although Li Lianying was an eunuch, he relied on the Empress Dowager Cixi's favor, used family law to coerce Emperor Guangxu, and used his power to suppress various ministers. He openly engaged in bribery, collected illegal fees, falsely conveyed imperial edicts, and fabricated victory reports. When the matter was exposed and reported, Emperor Guangxu wanted to execute him as a warning to others, but Empress Dowager Cixi lightly dismissed the matter, preventing it from being mentioned again. This made Li Lianying even more despotic and unscrupulous. Therefore, it became a situation where "peace negotiations originated from the Empress Dowager's intentions, and the eunuch Li Lianying actually manipulated them." If he had been a loyal eunuch, the modern history of China would certainly be different, and it would definitely be better than it is now!</p>
<p>"Unofficial History of the Qing Palace" is a drama, and even more a modern history. It tells us that the autocracy and incompetence of a few people can plunge an entire nation into decline and make the people of the entire country live in pain and shame!</p>
<h3>Lighting and Color</h3>
<p>— Wen Quan</p>
<p>Lighting has already become the original mission of illumination. Its new tasks in the theater are: to depict the beautiful rhythm of nature (poetry), to present the artistic conception of the spiritual activities hidden in music, to complete the function of set movement, the appreciation of color, the aesthetic sense of three-dimensionality, and the physical balance. It also has to create the flow of the whole play's atmosphere and the brewing of character transformation. It is a soul work of great difficulty. No wonder Adolphe Appia said: Light is the life of the modern stage. Terence Gray said: One-third of the drama's expression depends on the vivid use of light to achieve it.</p>
<p>The shape and color of all objects are known by the reflection of the objects. Especially color, it can express its own color because it leaves the color it cannot absorb, and then reflects it. To put it more concretely, for example, when white light is projected onto a leaf, the leaf absorbs the other six pigments in the white light and reflects the green color that it cannot absorb, thus becoming green. Similarly, a blue film absorbs the six pigments in white light other than blue, so the white light passing through this film becomes blue. This is the simplest color property. In addition, the combination of light color and dyeing will produce a third mixed color (as previously discussed in a special topic). This is the main reason why lighting is taking a new artistic stage. If this main reason cannot exert more diverse and changeable wisdom, the artistic value of lighting will return to destruction.</p>
<p>To express the three-dimensional and architectural movement of the drama, the first thing to pay attention to is its light source. The light in nature is the most perfect color light to express three-dimensionality. But the desire of art is often to surpass nature. So, in addition to the reasonable light and shadow of the object, we ask it to lengthen or shorten, and we ask that certain light and shadows be dyed with complementary colors. Here I would like to give a great ideal: in the scene of the "Macbeth" magic cave, when those witches are frying bloody things in front of the red fire, several dark green (the complementary color of red) giant magic shadows are reflected on the background of the dark ocher giant claw-like leaves, how moving this picture should be. All lighting art expresses the atmosphere, mood, and even the artistic conception of the soul, the movement of the scenery, etc.</p>
<p>In addition to the most basic imitation of nature or the changing color of the set, the use of color light should further complete the three-dimensional and external physical force and the impact of the inner dramatic force by projecting shadows. It should also be able to be like the finishing touch. Unify the form and color of the drama with powerful color touches, and create the spirituality of the drama. Those active modeling, spatial perspective, vivid illusion, and harmony of the picture are just the intuition of junior apprentices, and are not worth mentioning as the end point.</p>
<p>Drama is composed of the encounters of countless living things picked from the living world. The souls, emotions, and experiences of actors with life travel personally through the encounters of the characters, and cooperate with the stage technicians to complete the dramatic art created in the script. For actors, creating living art with living people is of course easier than creating living art with inanimate scenery and lighting. Conversely, it is precisely because it is difficult that its artistic value is increased. Apia discovered the hypnotic effect of lighting in Wagner's music dramas, so he used all the knowledge in color (the hint and symbolic power of color hue and brightness) to make all the backgrounds, such as forests and rocks, move in harmony with the action. This was a surprising discovery at first, but now it has become inevitable knowledge. We know that when the sun sets and the afterglow fills the sky, it will give us a slow and pleasant flow. Another example is a black night. After a flash of lightning, it will give us an uneasy and trembling feeling. Isn't this power given by color light? In addition, in hypnotism, making people stare at a rotating and bright light disk will gradually lose rational activity. At this time, he will let us pour anything into his brain, and he will honestly trust it, and follow the joy, anger, sorrow, and joy of the plot to complete the educational function of the drama.</p>
<p>Light is the mother of color, and color is the element of light. This element has had its urgent, stable value and emotion in human history. If you want to directly hit the audience's senses, avoid the audience's prejudices and psychological processes, color light is more powerful than white light. It is easier to arouse people's anger and easier to break into the highest artistic realm.</p>
<h3>Two MGM Masterpieces</h3>
<p>— Xin Ming</p>
<p>"Courage of Lassie" After the release of "Lassie Come Home", the acting skills of the dog star Lassie have been highly praised everywhere. Therefore, MGM specially produced a new film for it, entitled "Courage of Lassie". The entire film is in natural color, and the supporting cast includes the great Frank Morgan, the child star Elizabeth Taylor, and the new star Tom Drake.</p>
<p>"Easy to Wed" This film is a colorful musical masterpiece that MGM has put all its efforts into this year; featuring the unprecedented collaboration of Isa Whitney, Lucy Bauer, and Van Johnson.</p>
<h3>Life and Art</h3>
<p>— Gao Heng</p>
<p>Life is the cradle of art!</p>
<p>Life is the treasure house of artists!</p>
<p>Artists must deeply excavate this treasure house. In this way, his works of art will be vivid and real; his artistic life will be able to progress and achieve success; drama is a synthesis of art, that is, the architectural expression in art. In other words, it is the most powerful and sharp link in art.</p>
<p>A poem sings the heart's song of the world, an essay expresses the injustice of society, a novel tells the twists and turns of the world, a piece of music plays the lament of mankind, a painting depicts the ugliness of the universe, and a scene of drama must bring the spirit of poetry, essays, novels, music, and paintings to the stage, and give praise and criticism to the grief, injustice, ugliness, truth, kindness, and beauty between human society. This is the confluence of art! It is also the torrent of life!</p>
<p>What is expressed in drama is nothing more than war, love..., these are all aspects of human life. Life is a struggle. Under the conditions of each person's pursuit of survival, various struggles occur. You have to struggle with love, struggle with war, struggle with money, struggle with bread, struggle with cold, struggle with desire, struggle with others, and also struggle with your own inner self. This is man! This is human life! This is the various forms of life! It is also the various aspects expressed in art!</p>
<p>Therefore, an artist, especially a dramatic artist, must go deep into all levels and corners of human beings, observe, experience, analyze, and study from various different angles, and then use your correct thoughts and passionate emotions to reflect on your art. In this way, your art can truly achieve "the reflection of life."</p>
<p>If you want to be a dramatic artist, you must go to the bustling streets, the desolate countryside; high-rise buildings, thatched huts, the mansions of the rich, the residences of the poor; the delicate pavilions of young ladies, the corners of beggars' walls; you even have to go to the gambling dens where you call out numbers and shout, and take a look at the brothels where colors are unshielded. You also have to make friends with doctors and lawyers, and you also have to chat with fortune tellers and character testers... This is life! This is knowledge! This is the material of drama! This is the nourishment of dramatists! You must firmly grasp it! You must firmly embrace it!</p>
<p>This is not enough, you must live with them in this crowd, breathe their breath, experience their pain, understand their thoughts, exchange their emotions, go deep into the depths of their souls, love what they love, hate what they hate, enjoy their joy, and grieve their sorrow; only in this way can you be in tune with them, understand them thoroughly; however, you must also carefully pay attention to appropriately control your emotions and reason.</p>
<p>A dramatist cannot be a patient, he should be like a brilliant doctor. He diagnoses the diseases of society, understands the suffering of the people, prescribes the right medicine for the disease, and publishes his diagnosis report to mankind. Only in this way can he prevent the spread of diseases and restore the health of patients, and human society can benefit practically.</p>
<p>Therefore, you must improve your life, enrich your life, go deep into the hearts and minds of the people, and bravely go to the furnace of life. This is an inexhaustible treasure!</p>
<p>Dramatists, you must first live in the hearts of the people, and then the people will live in your art.</p>
<h3>"China Electric" Movie News</h3>
<p>"Distant Love" After all the interior scenes are completed by the end of the month, the exterior scenes of young people engaged in political propaganda work during the War of Resistance will be filmed in Wuxi at the beginning of next month. It is reported that the Drama Team No. 9, which is currently working in Wuxi, will participate in the film, with the real political work team playing the political work team in the film.</p>
<p>"Returning Home in Glory," written and directed by Zhao Dan, is currently in preparation for filming. In addition to the leading actress, Lu Ming, the play also needs a young girl-type role. Chen Juanjuan was originally intended to take on the role, but Chen is preparing to go to Hong Kong to shoot a film, so the actress is still being actively sought.</p>
<h3>The Poplars in the Tale of the Holy City</h3>
<h3>Characters in "Of Mice and Men"</h3>
<p>— Wu Yonggang</p>
<p>Xia Zhibing, Ying Shijie, and Li Ruolan are classmates and close friends. Zhibing and Shijie both love Ruolan. Ruolan is Zhibing's cousin who grew up with him. The memories of childhood life make Zhibing deeply love Ruolan, but also deepen his pain, because he has a contradictory character; he is brave and upright like Don Quixote, and hesitant and hesitant like Hamlet. He grieves for his poverty and arrogant personality, and also compares his poverty and arrogant personality to Cyrano's big nose, because the big nose is a burden on Cyrano's love, so he also hides his love in his heart, letting Shijie gain Ruolan's love, but he can't get rid of his contradictory, tangled mood, and has the sadness common to young intellectuals from the petty bourgeoisie.</p>
<p>Shijie is a contrasting character. He has a noble family background, handsome appearance, and cheerful personality. He dares to say and do anything, and only seeks to achieve his goals by any means, even to the point of building his own happiness on the pain of others.</p>
<p>Ruolan is an innocent girl who enjoys everyone's love for her. In her heart, she doesn't know what sorrows there are in the world.</p>
<p>The three of them played the Western classic play "Cyrano de Bergerac" together at school. Zhibing played Cyrano de Bergerac, Ruolan played Roxane, and Zhibing also announced the news of Shijie and Ruolan's engagement. This made his own heart even sadder and more painful. Finally, an inspiration freed him from the pain of love. He wanted to do a little bit of human responsibility and do a little bit of human work. He believed that if the Chinese nation could not be liberated from imperialism, there would never be a chance for free survival. He missed his hometown in the Northeast, which had fallen under the iron hooves of Japanese imperialism. So, he must do something for his hometown, must fight against rat-like people, and even eliminate them! But in the end, he still guarded Ruolan, and both heroically sacrificed for the nation!</p>

<p>Spring and Autumn</p>
<h3>Viewing the Exhibition of Calligraphy and Painting from Past Dynasties</h3>
<p>— Dingshan</p>
<p>Among Pang Xuzhai's exhibits, Ni Yunlin's "Yuan Hui Du Shi" scroll is the highlight, and also the highlight of the entire exhibition. He Shizun's cat and rock painting is dated to the Song dynasty. Dai Jin's imitation of Yan Wengui's landscape is also exquisite. If Li Cheng and Guo Xi are concerned, the old collector has many fine pieces hidden away, and he shows people Ye Gong's dragon instead. Why?</p>
<p>Wang Zhongming is the mainstay of the exhibition's initiators. His family has Huang Zijiu's "Nine Peaks and Clouds," which is enough to be the crown of the Yuan Four Masters, but he keeps it hidden. He only exhibited Ma Wenbi's "Poetic Scene of Muyun," Yao Shou's "Bamboo and Birds," Wen Zhengming's "Preserving Chrysanthemums," and Hua Qiuyue's "Willow and Swallows" - three paintings, leaving people with a sense of incompleteness. However, they are all fine pieces.</p>
<p>Zhang Congyu has a rich collection and exhibited a lot of pieces. Chu Mu's "Guan Ting" with Mi Yuanzhang's inscription can be considered a superb original work. Wu Zhonggui's "Bamboo and Stone," Chen Qiushui's landscape made for Yan Sizhai, and Ma Wenbi's "Spring Water Building Boats" are all fine works by Yuan artists. However, Ni Yunlin's works are not exhibited outside of Yu Shan's Lin Yu, causing Pang Xuzhai's "Yuan Hui Du Shi" to stand alone and dominate the time. Is it that Congyu treasures this divine piece so much that he does not want to easily show it to others?</p>
<p>Wu Hufan exhibited Shi Tao's "Panoramic View of the Yangtze River" scroll, a monumental work.</p>
<p>Wang Nanping's collection of Mi Youren's "Xiao Xiang Wonderful Views" and Zhou Xiangyun's old collection are equally outstanding. Among Mi's cloud mountains seen in the world, these are likely the only ones. Although both scrolls are damaged, Wang's scroll is better. Zhou's scroll can still be exquisitely repaired. If a good restorer can be found, it will surely shine brightly. Does Nanping have intentions regarding Mi's meritorious deeds?</p>
<p>Feng Chaoran has Fan Kuan's "Northern Peak Gang," Tan Hechang has Ma Yuan's "Treading Song Picture," Wu Hufan has Zhao Boju's "Immortal Mountain Pavilion," and Zhang Congyu has Zhao Yong's "Autumn Stream Quiet Fishing." These are the true dragon and elephant among the Song paintings in this exhibition.</p>
<p>Wu Ziyie has Gu Dingzhi's "Ink Bamboo" scroll, which is the most scholarly of Gu's bamboo paintings. It is a pity that there are official seals everywhere, all from the hands of painting merchants. He also exhibited Dong Qichang's landscape scroll, which is also a good collaboration.</p>
<p>Ding Huikang has Ma Yuan's "Treading Snow to Seek Plums," which is also a genuine piece, but inferior to "Treading Song Picture." He also has Shi Xi's "Green Mountain Piercing Clouds" scroll, which he recently acquired for 2.4 million, making it a divine work of Shi Xi.</p>
<p>The Four Wangs and Wu Yun occupy the most space. Yanke considers his own "Lu Xiang Shu Tang" scroll to be a masterpiece. Lianzhou's Xu Bangyuan scroll is both exquisite and long. For Shigu, there is my imitation of the landscape of Meihua Temple, and Wang Jiqian's "Mountain Residence Talking About Taoism." For Nongtai, there is my imitation of Ni Gaoshi's landscape, and Pang Xuzhai's "Four Wonders of Landscape." For Yushan, there is Pang Xuzhai's "Lake and Sky Spring Colors" and Wang Nanping's "Wellside Summer." For Nantian, there is my "Withered Tree and Bamboo Stone" and Xiang Shu Tang's "Fish Algae."</p>
<h3>Kim Dong-xin's Self-Portrait</h3>
<p>— Zhou Shushan</p>
<p>The inscriptions on paintings by the Qing dynasty artist Kim Dong-xin have long been treasured by the world, and he wrote quite a few inscriptions for self-portraits as well. Now, I have again seen one of his self-portraits from when he was seventy-three years old. It was originally painted as a gift for his friend Ding Gan-shen, and was later included in the "Collection of Famous Figures" by the Xiling Seal Art Society. Both the inscription and the painting are truly precious items.</p>
<p>This self-portrait depicts him with a beautiful beard and thick neck, without a hat and wearing loose clothing, a short braid hanging down his back, and leaning on a walking stick. His eyes look forward, as if he is walking slowly, and the length of the stick exceeds half his height, resembling a fishing rod. The portrait is both unrestrained and detached, resembling a wild old man. The painting is even more simple, ancient, and lush, brimming with untamed interest. It truly does not disgrace the name of a master. I have also seen the first page of the "Dongxin Guang Sheng Collection," which also features a print of another portrait of him in his later years, similar to this self-portrait at age seventy-three, but it was later re-painted by Ding Wen-wei based on a painting by Ren Wei-chang. Furthermore, Gao Xiang (also known as Xi Tang), one of the "Eight Eccentrics of Yangzhou," painted a portrait of him at the age of forty-seven, which is also considered a masterpiece.</p>
<p>Kim Dong-xin's given name was Nong, his courtesy name was Shoumen. He was a native of Qiantang during the Qing dynasty. In the early years of the Qianlong era, he was recommended for the Hongbo Examination but did not take it. Instead, he made a living through poetry, literature, calligraphy, and painting in Yangzhou, and thus became one of the "Eight Eccentrics of Yangzhou." He authored the "Dongxin Collection," and his miscellaneous writings are also numerous. Regarding the inscription on this self-portrait, he wrote:</p>
<p>"In painting a likeness with a single dab of rice, during the Jin dynasty there was Gu Kaizhi, who painted Pei Kai, and during the Southern Qi dynasty there was Xie He, who captured the spirit of Pu Su. During the Tang dynasty, Wang Wei painted a portrait of Meng Haoran at the Prefectural Governor's pavilion, and during the Song dynasty, Zhi Wang painted a portrait of Zhang Jiuling, Zhu Bao-yi painted a portrait of Zhang Guo, Li Fang painted a portrait of the Layman of Fragrant Mountain, Song Lin Shao-yun painted a portrait of Mr. Xijia on the road to Mount Hua, Li Shi-huo painted a portrait of the Old Man of Banshan riding a donkey, He Chong painted a portrait of the Layman Su Dongpo, and Zhang Datong painted a small portrait of the Old Man of Shangu on Mount Mowei. These are all masterpieces of portraiture. However, there has never been anyone who painted a portrait of himself, except as recorded in the 'Yunji Qiqian,' that during the Da Zhong era of the Tang dynasty, a Daoist priest named Wu used a mirror and brush to paint his own likeness. Therefore, I have used the ink wash white drawing method to paint a portrait of myself, an old man of three dynasties, at the age of seventy-three. I have painted the folds of the clothing and the features of the face with a single brush stroke, with Lu Tanwei as my model. After the painting is completed, I will send it far away to my old friend Ding Dun-ding in my hometown, a recluse. Recluse, you have not seen me for nearly five years. Can you not miss me? One day, when I return to the Jiang River, I will join you, staff in hand, reciting poetry and competing in wit, proving that my aging appearance has not lost its mountain forest air. Inscribed by Kim Nong on the day of the Beginning of Autumn in the intercalary sixth month of the twenty-fourth year of Qianlong, at the Nine-Joint Sweet Flag Studio of the monk Zeng Zhi in Guangling."</p>
<p>At this time, this old man was already past seventy years old, yet he was still residing at a monk's assembly in Yangzhou. One can imagine his tranquil and lofty sentiments. However, he could not forget his own aging, and often thought of his hometown and his old friends. This is probably a common human emotion. On the left corner of the painting is a small square seal that reads "Seal of Ding Jingshen," indicating his collection. However, I do not know if the original still exists in the world today.</p>
<p>The style of Mr. Dongxin can generally be seen in his poetry, literature, calligraphy, and painting, and the abundance of his talent can also be seen in these. He was truly skilled in seal script calligraphy, and his works in his later years reached the same state of simplicity as his paintings, and therefore both were treasured by others.</p>
<h3>Picture of Spring Scenery on Lakes and Sky (Collected by [Name])</h3>

<h3>The Trend of Collecting in Shanghai</h3>
<p>— Pan Boying</p>
<p>Today in Shanghai, there is a laughable and dangerous trend among those who collect ancient calligraphy and paintings. This bad trend is to not collect silk paintings, but only paper paintings, and to want "fresh and spicy" paper paintings. The so-called "fresh and spicy" means that the paintings have been carefully preserved and circulated, and although they are old paintings, they feel like new to the touch, so new that it is intense.</p>
<p>There is no need to talk about the fact that most paintings from the Tang and Five Dynasties periods are silk paintings. Even when it comes to Song and Yuan paintings, almost all of Emperor Huizong of Song's paintings that have been passed down are silk paintings. Wang Jinqing used silk when imitating ancient works, but used paper for original compositions (in today's terms, creations of his own). Zhao Ziang and Qian Shunju both used silk and paper together. Only after Huang Heshanqiao and Ni Yunlin did paper paintings become more common. However, during the Ming and Qing dynasties, due to advances in technology, the silk became even finer. Many painters from these two dynasties used silk. People in the Ming Dynasty even expanded the use of silk fabrics. In addition to silk, they also liked to use silk twill. Wu Meicun once described the pleasure of writing on silk twill in his poems. Therefore, among the masterpieces that have been passed down from ancient times, silk paintings account for half. If we follow the standard of Shanghai collectors who admire paper paintings today, wouldn't we be abandoning half of the famous works of calligraphy and painting out of thin air?</p>
<p>We admit that paper paintings have a longer lifespan than silk paintings, and paper paintings are easier to collect and open (opening a painting and then rolling it up is not something that an inexperienced person can do. If it is not done well, it will damage the painting). Both are less likely to be damaged than silk paintings. This may be the reason why Shanghai collectors want to collect paper paintings today. However, I believe that this is precisely the reason why we should not not collect silk paintings. My friend Xie Zhiliu once made a wonderful analogy for the difference between silk and paper. Zhiliu said that silk and paper are like a pair of sons in calligraphy and painting. The silk son is weak, and the paper son is strong. A strong son is of course much better. But there are also many good weak sons. I have never heard of a good son being kicked out of the house because he is weak. This analogy is extremely clear. I believe that precisely because silk paintings are not easy to preserve and famous works are being damaged day by day, collectors should make an extra effort to seek out fine silk paintings and preserve them carefully, in order to remedy the inherent defects of silk paintings. If we push the boat along with the tide and refrain from collecting them together, then the fate of silk paintings will be even more dire.</p>
<p>We infer that Shanghai collectors are tending towards paper paintings, and are all tending towards "fresh and spicy" paper paintings, and we cannot help but have a pessimistic explanation for this mentality. These collectors are not collecting for the sake of collecting, but for the sake of making money. Their collection of calligraphy and paintings is equivalent to hoarding goods. Therefore, they are only willing to spend money on collecting the easiest to sell and the least likely to be damaged. Whether they are true connoisseurs or nouveau riche, they are willing to pay money to buy "fresh and spicy" paper paintings, so the tastes of collectors are tending towards this path. Under the principle that economics determines everything, we also forgive this kind of mentality. However, if this bad mentality becomes a trend today, and it becomes more and more intense, then famous silk paintings will disappear from the world. Now Shanghai is the only center in China where cultural relics are gathered. At a time when the country is scarred and all the arts are lost, this trend in Shanghai will quickly spread to other places. Because Shanghai, which is the richest place, does not collect silk paintings, other places will not collect them either.</p>
<p>Most people who can collect calligraphy and paintings are people who have spare money. Even if they are entrepreneurs or various businessmen, they at least have some interest in calligraphy and painting. Therefore, I would like to advise these people to focus more on their interests. Since you are playing with calligraphy and painting, don't try to make money from calligraphy and painting anymore. The elegance of some salt merchants in the past has been passed down as a joke. But at least they didn't make money from the "elegance" they were playing with. There may not necessarily be a difference between ancient and modern people. Why be laughed at by salt merchants? In this way, the cultural purpose can be achieved incidentally. More silk painting masterpieces can be preserved if they can be collected together. (At the same time, you will definitely not lose money). If not, there will inevitably be outstanding artists among the descendants of these collectors in the future. If they want to find a few silk paintings, they will not know that they have long been destroyed by their fathers and grandfathers!</p>
<p>Therefore, we say very sadly that this is a laughable and dangerous trend.</p>
<p>However, we still believe that there are still many true connoisseurs in Shanghai. They will definitely not discriminate between silk and paper when collecting calligraphy and paintings. They will definitely put their interest in appreciation and their cultural purpose before their "business eye." At the same time, the senior elders of society and the backbone of culture and education will definitely be able to fulfill their leadership responsibilities. If we can prevent this trend from getting worse, and gradually promote it to a path of active development, that would be good.</p>
<p>When the social atmosphere is going downhill, it is always unpleasant to hear someone say something unpleasant. The trend of collecting should also be like this. However, this matter is too important, and there are too few people willing to say such things now, so I dare to make an appeal. Whether you know I am guilty or not, I can only leave it to Hongda's understanding.</p>
<h3>An Inch of Land, An Inch of Blood 47</h3>
<p>— Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>After returning to the station from Ding Yuan, I received a message from Mr. W saying that Song Zheyuan had officially ordered the entire 29th Army to mobilize for war. (This order, if it had been issued twenty days earlier, or even ten days, or five days earlier, would have been much more certain. Although it would not have been possible to drive all the Japanese invaders out of the country, at least it could have given them a fatal blow.) In the midst of my busy schedule, I mentioned Ding Yuan's matter to Mr. W again. Mr. W said, "It's best to ask him to go to Beiping first. Several senior generals of the 29th Army are here," and said that he could definitely be responsible for the introduction. I also explained Ding Yuan's illness and his request, and asked if he could introduce him to Zhang Zizhong, Feng Zhian, or any division commander, and just issue an appointment order. Mr. W said, "Try to handle it as soon as possible. I will let you know as soon as I have news." I immediately wrote a note with this message and sent it to Ding Yuan.</p>
<p>Before midnight, there were occasionally one or two cannon shots and a few sporadic machine gun sounds. After twelve o'clock, it was completely quiet, so quiet that it was a little unsettling. Because I was very busy with intelligence work these two days, and I also had to arrange for my men to scout the nearby areas, I could only rest in pieces, so I was exhausted. Perhaps because of excessive fatigue, and because the atmospheric pressure was very low, it was a bit stuffy. At the same time, I was still thinking about the war situation and Ding Yuan's matter, so I tossed and turned on the sleeping platform. I had just fallen asleep with great difficulty, but was suddenly awakened by a loud bang. It sounded like a very large shell had exploded, and even the earthen bed jumped. Number 04 was in the room at this time, waiting for news. Seeing that I had been awakened by the loud noise, he quickly said, "It's okay. The Japanese have been firing for five minutes. It must be a shell exploding... But it's very close to here." As he was saying this, someone came in from outside to report: "A bomb has fallen under Tushan Ridge, near the corner of the power plant."</p>
<p>"A bomb?" I was still a little drowsy. "Why didn't I hear a plane?"</p>
<p>"There was one, but it's already far away... Very high altitude."</p>
<p>I was very surprised. According to Japanese intelligence, they were clearly saying that they would attack at dawn on the 28th. Why did it start in the middle of the night? Maybe the plan has changed? Who knew that when I looked at the clock, it was already 5:07. Because the sky was cloudy, it wasn't as bright as usual. Only then did I realize that although I felt like I had only dozed off for a short while, I had already slept for more than four hours.</p>
<p>At this time, the artillery fire, light and heavy machine guns, and rifles on both sides in the Wanping area were ten times more intense than before. This was because the Japanese had repeatedly provoked in the past, and our side had only responded slightly because they had not received orders from the commander. This time, however, there was a clear order to resist the war, so of course they attacked with all their might. Although the Japanese had dispatched planes to assist in the battle, and there were also tanks charging on the ground, they were no match for the anger that our army had been holding back for more than twenty days. Once it was vented, it was incomparably fierce.</p>
<p>From the start of the war at five o'clock to six o'clock, the radio constantly broadcast good news. The three external affairs officers that we had sent out also returned one after another to report that our side was winning in the Wanping area. At 6:30, Beiping Radio, based on battlefield telephone calls, confirmed that our side had recovered Fengtai, Chenjiazhuang, Huangtupo, and other places. At seven o'clock, our army in Nanyuan captured two Japanese tanks, and suicide squads used explosives to destroy several Japanese giant tanks, curbing the enemy's momentum of charging and breaking through the lines. At 9:30, Zhang Zizhong's troops recovered Langfang, shot down a Japanese plane, intercepted three tanks outside Tongzhou, destroyed two, and killed hundreds of enemies.</p>
<p>Based on the secret intelligence I had gathered over the past ten days or so, I was extremely clear about the strength and formations of both the enemy and our side. I knew that once the great war started, our army would definitely be unable to stop the enemy's advance, because the comparison of numbers was ten to two against us; the comparison of military equipment was that the enemy's was new and ours was old, and we lacked everything. Not to mention airplanes and tanks, our side had nothing, and we even lacked anti-aircraft guns and mortars to resist airplanes and tanks. The only weapon we had to resist the enemy was a sense of justice that was carried out in one breath. This sense of justice could also be said to be a sense of grief and indignation at the enemy's unprovoked invasion, or it could be said to be a spirit of righteousness to protect the motherland and not allow the mountains and rivers to fall under the hooves of beasts. In any case, I knew that the war situation would not last long.</p>

<h3>Backdoor Transactions</h3>
<p>— Shaofu</p>
<p>I have discussed the recent surge in the price of US dollars, believing that it was entirely caused by speculation. Sure enough, according to the results of an investigation by a reporter from this newspaper yesterday, Li Lixia, director of the Financial Institutions Inspection Department of the Central Bank, stated that the daily business figures reported by some money shops engaged in foreign currency trading differed greatly from the daily exchange volume of each shop at the clearing house. Among them, the Santai and Yuxing money shops are the most suspected. The Central Bank has sent personnel to thoroughly investigate, and if the circumstances are serious, they will be dealt with according to the law.</p>
<p>We believe that this thorough investigation will definitely uncover serious circumstances.</p>
<p>Speculation is already commonplace. There are many such things in Shanghai, both large and small. But what is strange is that the Santai money shop involved in this case is the protagonist in the Central Bank gold case three months ago. It has already been suspended from business. Although the front door has been sealed, it is engaged in backdoor transactions. There are dozens of telephones for talking about business. It has reached such a scale, and the trading activities have been going on for more than a day. Why was it only discovered that it was engaged in backdoor transactions until this time when the price of US dollars surged? This is really puzzling.</p>
<p>It is too late to mend the fold after the sheep have been lost, but if it is not mended again, it is inevitable that more sheep will escape. We hope that the authorities will get to the root of the problem and thoroughly investigate this time. Otherwise, maybe gold or rice will experience another big turnaround in a week or two.</p>

<h3>Hardoon Garden to be Converted into a Park</h3>
<p>— Zhengfan</p>
<p>"The central district needs a park!" This slogan has been shouted for a long time. Because of the racecourse problem, many people advocate converting it into a park, and this slogan has been shouted even more vigorously. This can't help but make people think of the "Great View Garden on the Sea" famous throughout the country - Hardoon Garden. It occupies three hundred mu of land in the central district, and the garden gate is closed all year round, allowing the pavilions and towers in the garden to gradually collapse and the vegetation to become overgrown. This is really too "wasteful" and "selfish." The Municipal Bureau of Public Works has negotiated with the person in charge of the garden several times to rent it and open it as a park for citizens to play in. It is said that the heirs of Hardoon have expressed their strong approval. After the renovation is completed, it can be opened. In this way, residents in the central district can obtain an excellent place for recreation, and Hardoon Garden will also lose its "mystery."</p>
<p>The reason why Hardoon Garden is called the "Great View Garden on the Sea" is of course due to the beauty of the pavilions, towers, ponds, and rocks. Because it has always refused to open to the public, the situation in the garden is not well known to outsiders. In the eighth year of the Republic of China, the rebel Wang Yitang lived in the garden and wrote an article "Record of Ailiyuan," which described it in great detail, such as the Begonia Boat, the Zhilan Studio, the Huangnie Mountain House, the Jiyeting Pavilion, the Tingfeng Pavilion, the Willow Bay, the Xuwu Bridge, the Guanyuting Pavilion, the Menbiting Pavilion, the Dieyin Corridor, the Donggui Xuan, the Shipiao, the Kunlunyuan, the Yinquan, the Jiusi Hall, the Xiaoyingzhou, the Yucui Pavilion, the Beidongtian, the Shiping Terrace, the Jiangxue Sea, and the Hongmiao Village... There are as many as hundreds of such names, making people feel even more eager to take a look as soon as possible. At the end of the text, Wang rebel wrote: "The garden owner is very hospitable, and guests feel at home. The famous gardens and scenic spots, the fish and birds are friendly to people, and it is not a small help to take a break from hard work." It is all written with a bit of smugness.</p>
<p>Hardoon Garden, in the historical sense, is closely related to the prosperity of Shanghai. When the Jewish Hardoon roamed to Shanghai, Shanghai was not yet the "Ten Mile Foreign Concession." Due to the昏庸 corruption of the Manchu Qing government, various countries bought land and opened concessions, and the market gradually prospered, and Hardoon's real estate business made a lot of money. Half of the tall buildings on Nanjing Road are Hardoon's property: Hardoon Building, Jialu Building, Cishu Building, and countless "Ci" and "Ni" character head lilong buildings are all. After making money, I naturally wanted to enjoy the blessings, so I hired many experts, spent a lot of effort, spent millions of dollars, and spent three years to complete this Hardoon Garden.</p>
<p>There are Hidden Affairs in the Garden</p>
<p>The strange stories and romantic scraps in Hardoon Garden have always been the focus of attention of Shanghai people. A certain celebrity collected the hidden affairs in the garden and compiled a novel for publication. Later, the book was bought up and out of print. In short, the situation is like Jiao Da's criticism of the Rongguo Mansion in Dream of the Red Chamber.</p>
<p>In the early years of the Republic of China, a university was actually run in the garden, with a strange name - "Huisheng Mingzhi University." It recruited male and female students, and all the expenses for the students were provided by the garden. However, the school spirit was stubborn and old-fashioned, the school rules were extremely strict, and those who entered the school had to follow the rules on time and be vegetarians for a year. Most of the students were forced to run away by climbing over the wall. Soon after, the students rose up in opposition, launching a student movement, and the school was disbanded. Later, the so-called "Huayan Fire School" was established, which was purely monastic education.</p>
<p>Hardoon's wife, Madam Luo Jialing, was a devout Buddhist, so she built a nunnery in Ailiyuan to worship Buddha, just like a temple. She also adopted many monks and nuns, and the "bald heads" were all over the place, as if there was another world. Luo Jialing herself did not have any children, but she loved to adopt adopted sons and daughters. The male and female high-achieving students of that "Cangsheng Mingzhi University" were often asked to kneel before her, and there were no less than a hundred people in total. After Luo Jialing's "driving back to Penglai," the adopted children fought over the inheritance, and the lawsuits were endless.</p>
<p>I Hope It Will Be Realized Soon</p>
<p>Getting back to the main topic: The suggestion to turn Hardoon Garden into a park was made after Madam Luo Jialing's death in the 30th year of the Republic of China (before that, no one dared to make the suggestion, and it was useless to make the suggestion). The English-language Continental Daily specially wrote an editorial "Making Hardoon Garden a Park," suggesting that the "Shanghai Municipal Council" take immediate action to acquire the property for use as a park, and suggested that investment be made to issue bonds to fund the purchase. Unfortunately, there was no sound or smell of it later. Some people also advocated opening a commercial field in Hardoon Garden, and the proceeds would be used for relief work, but there was no follow-up.</p>
<p>Now that the Municipal Bureau of Public Works has a plan to convert Hardoon Garden into a park, the opening of this "Great View Garden on the Sea" is no problem. We urgently wish in advance that this private enjoyment den will soon be transformed into a public paradise for millions of citizens!</p>
<h3>Soul, Come Back!</h3>
<p>— Deyun</p>
<p>When I was a child, I was often frightened and became ill, which troubled my mother, who would "call back my soul" for me at night. I remember, I remember deeply: this is great maternal love.</p>
<p>But I believe that at that time, I did not lose anything. But today, whenever I search my heart in the middle of the night, I begin to believe: I have indeed lost my kind soul.</p>
<p>Indeed, years of social life have merged me into the dirty currents of the sea of people. Oh, God, where has my beautiful and pure soul gone?</p>
<p>I want to light a stick of incense in this autumn night, like my mother did. I want to sincerely and silently pray that the pure soul that was forced to be lost will return to my heart!</p>
<h3>Desire</h3>
<p>— A</p>
<p>The simplification of spiritual desires allows a person to have a lifelong sustenance and a destination for life; but the intricate complexity of material desires is an eternal source of pain.</p>
<h3>Three Days of American Life</h3>
<p>— Cheng Zhi</p>
<p>For a year, American goods have flooded the market. Whether it is food, supplies, or clothing, they are all strange and beautiful, making people envious and lovable. Although they are cheap and good, a poor boy like me would not dare to have such extravagant thoughts. But being able to stroll down the road and visit companies, taking the opportunity to look at the various luxurious and magnificent American equipment in the windows, is already quite satisfying.</p>
<p>This time, thanks to the blessing of the American army and the generosity of the Materials Supply Bureau, I was able to get three days' worth of surplus food from the American army at a low price for public and religious personnel. Although I felt that 9,000 yuan was still a pain, I thought that this would not only allow me to taste the American flavor, but also to enjoy three days of American life. Why not do it? So I paid the money generously and waited for the arrival of the day of distribution.</p>
<p>The day before yesterday morning, I received nine bags of things from the distribution point. I was very happy. Moreover, it is said that this batch is still from 1945, so the mildew situation that was rumored would certainly not happen.</p>
<p>A Variety of Things</p>
<p>At 12:00 noon, I started my three days of American life. I carefully opened a bag labeled "D" from the drawer and carefully took out the things inside one by one, carefully observing them. Of course, there were many colors, including biscuits, cheese, lemon powder, sugar cubes, cigarettes, matches, candy, gummy bears, and coffee candy. So I spread the cheese on the biscuits and ate them, then had a big spoonful of coffee candy, then a glass of lemonade, and a cigarette. After work started in the afternoon, I could still eat some candy in my spare time. Although I felt a little sweet and greasy, I was quite satisfied.</p>
<p>Not Very Comfortable</p>
<p>For dinner, the first course was beef soup made with powder and biscuits, followed by canned meatloaf, and finally chocolate candy and gummy bears. This stuff was too sweet and I was not interested, but I still forced myself to finish it. After dinner, I started reading as usual. But it seemed that not long after, my stomach was singing the empty city plan. The amount of food I ate today was of course less than usual, but the aspects were much better. I also opened a book about human nutrition and checked it. Of course, it was not bad. These foods were all complete with vitamin A, B, C, D, fat, carbohydrates, sugars, proteins, etc. This must have been designed by American nutrition experts. As long as the nutrition is sufficient, it doesn't matter if there is less food. Moreover, experts from various countries have always thought that Chinese people eat too much. After considering this, I went to bed calmly, but my stomach was rumbling and I couldn't sleep.</p>
<p>I got up at dawn the next morning. After washing up, I immediately started breakfast. The ham and eggs were not bad, but the rest was biscuits, candy, and other things that I hated. I could still force myself to eat the biscuits because I was hungry, but I could only politely decline the candy. Today, I don't know if it was because I was not in good spirits, but the work that I usually did without any effort seemed to be troublesome now.</p>
<p>No Blessing to Enjoy</p>
<p>Today's interest was far less than yesterday's. When I found out that the bag still had the same things as yesterday, I was even more unhappy. However, when I saw my colleagues cheering and celebrating, I was embarrassed to say that it was not delicious, and I was even more afraid that they would laugh at me for not being blessed to enjoy it. So I had to reluctantly do it, pretending to be very happy and eating the things. During the day, I felt nauseous and wanted to vomit, and there was an indescribable discomfort in my stomach!</p>
<p>The colleague sitting across from me saw that I was listless and, out of kindness, asked for leave for me and sent me back to the dormitory to rest.</p>
<p>When I woke up, the moon was already hanging on the willow branches. I thought to myself that I had not eaten yet, so I had to get out of bed and stagger to the desk, intending to open the box for supper. My eyes stared blankly at the biscuits and candy, and I had no appetite at all. Suddenly, I rushed downstairs and gave all the bags of things to the handyman Jin Gen. In his constant thanks, I had already stepped into a small noodle shop outside the dormitory, and a bowl of plain noodles immediately made me feel much better.</p>
<p>At this point, I was deeply convinced that I was an ordinary person who was not blessed to enjoy American life, and that I was not qualified to talk about vitamins, fats, and proteins.</p>
<h3>Amusing Anecdotes of Ma Zhanshan</h3>
<p>— Jinxia</p>
<p>Someone Claims to Be General Ma's Father</p>
<p>Yesterday, this newspaper's "News Personalities" discussed Ma Zhanshan. Here is an additional piece of historical material to supplement the account.</p>
<p>In the twenty-fifth year of the Republic of China [1936], the general encountered an amusing incident that, like his fame, caused a sensation throughout the country:</p>
<p>Beyond All Reason</p>
<p>It turns out that after General Ma returned from the Northeast at that time, he resided in the British Concession of Tianjin at No. 46 Road, living a secluded life, uninterested in worldly affairs. Suddenly, in July of the twenty-fourth year of the Republic of China [1935], an old man named Ma Rong from Fengrun came to Tianjin and petitioned the court, requesting confirmation that General Ma Zhanshan was his lost son. Because of improper jurisdiction (the plaintiff was from Fengrun and should have first petitioned the local court), the prosecutor did not accept the case. Unexpectedly, in July of the twenty-fifth year of the Republic of China [1936], Ma Rong came to Tianjin again, crying and making a scene in front of the General's residence, attempting to forcibly claim General Ma as his son. General Ma, finding that several attempts to dissuade him were ineffective and that reason was useless, filed a lawsuit in the Tianjin District Court's Criminal Division, accusing Ma Rong of defamation. At the same time, he also requested the Civil Division to confirm that there was no father-son relationship with Ma Rong.</p>
<p>Court Investigation</p>
<p>During the court investigation, according to Ma Rong's confession, his son was lost at the age of seven, and he was the same age, same name, same surname, same province, and same county as General Ma. He had two sons in total, the eldest son named Ma Zhanshan, and the younger son named Ma Shoushan. The eldest son had a "tethering post" (i.e., a wart) near his ear, and he requested identification to reunite father and son.</p>
<p>General Ma stated that although his ancestral home was Fengrun, Hebei, his family had lived in Huaide County, Liaoning Province, for generations. His biological father, Ma Chun, died of illness in Huaide on September 26 of the sixth year of the Republic of China [1917]. Zhang Dianjiu and Bao Tailai, who assisted with the funeral on that day, were called to court to testify. Furthermore, the General was born in the eleventh year of the Guangxu reign [1885], while Ma Rong's lost son's birthday was the eighth day of the twelfth month of the tenth year of the Guangxu reign [1884]. The court further ordered a forensic examination, which confirmed that the General had no "tethering post" near his ear.</p>
<p>Blood Drop Identification</p>
<p>Ma Rong requested "blood drop identification," but the judge believed that it was not in accordance with the law. According to modern medicine, blood drops are not sufficient to prove a blood relationship.</p>
<p>The court ruled: "There is no father-son relationship between the plaintiff and the defendant." The amusing drama that spread throughout the country came to an end.</p>
