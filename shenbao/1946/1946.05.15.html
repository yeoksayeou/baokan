<h3>鄭介民突飛京請示　華北局勢極度緊張</h3>
<p>〔本報北平十四日電〕軍調部委員鄭介民，今午突離平飛京，一般推測鄭氏此行象徵華北局勢，已極度緊張，軍調部已面臨重大困難，鄭氏亟須向中樞報吿或請示。目前華北情勢可以數語說明，即軍事調動頻繁，突衝到處發生，交通不斷破壞，情勢之壞，殆爲停戰協定以來所未有。但若謂共軍企岡進圍平津，似屬言過其實。今午政府某軍事首長語記者，華北共方一方大施調動，增援東北，一方破壞交通，阻止國軍增援東北。另一方面，則恐懼華北留守兵力單薄，故採以攻爲守戰略，四處出襲，惟此等繼續不已之小衝突，實大規模戰爭之溫床。華北局勢，亦殊可注意，津浦北段之衝突，頃爲此間注視之焦點。馮家口方面國軍業經開到，現正展開激戰。泊頭方面，猶爲共軍所據。平北懷柔·遵義·密雲周圍共軍李運品部，集結甚多，形勢亦極緊張。</p>
<p>〔本報北平十四日電〕軍調部政府方面，對共軍攻占馮家口泊頭，提出嚴重抗戰，懲治攻占該二地之共軍首腦，並即時撤出，吾則共方應負破壞停戰命令之責。共方則謂此乃因該方面共軍，曾受國軍攻擊所致。後泊頭小組美方代表提出建議，雙方均不在該二地駐軍。政府方面認爲倘如此解決，則此後不能保證不再發生類似情事，故堅持原來抗議之點，現尙不能解決，爲此，軍調部有另派小組前往調查之議。外傳泊頭小組政府代表糜洛漢遇害事，政府方面否認。</p>
<p>〔本報北平十四日電〕東北國運主要補給錢之北寗路，現正遭受共軍有計訓之連續之破壞。今日上午北寗路關外段前所高嶺兩站，突被萬餘共軍包圍，正激戰中，小安村一五六號鐵橋，今下午一時半被破壞，一五七號橋，下午三時半被破壞。前所至高嶺間之王家村東二公里鐵軌，亦被破壞。高嶺附近小松嶺溝，昨夜下午九時，即被萬餘共軍佔領。關內段唐山至山海關間電話，昨夜十一時被破壞後，迄今下午尙未恢復。</p>
<p>〔本報北平十四日電〕四平街之戰，消息紛歧。此間世界日報及大津益世報，今載緊急電謂：經過七日之戰鬥，該地已爲國軍完全攻下。但十日之新華社電稱：該城戰鬥，與國軍經過九日之砲戰後，即入膠着狀態。並稱：鄭洞國現在四平街南之雙廟子指揮作戰。</p>
<p>〔本報北平十五日電〕官方情報稱：共軍對各地部隊作戰部屬之指揮，近又有所規劃。山西方面劃分情形如下：（一）平漢綫石門彰德間，以西，白晋綫以東，正太綫南地區之部隊，歸劉伯誠指揮，李達副之。（二）太岳區及同蒲南段以東地區，歸陳賡指揮，韓鈞孫定國副之。（三）平漢綫北段，正太綫以北及同蒲錢北段以柬地區，歸聶榮臻指揮，陳正湘副之。（四）晋綏及陝甘寗邊區，由賀龍指揮，張宥遜蕭勁光副之。</p>

<h3>經交財部將易長　中常會國防會今日決定</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十四日電〕吳國楨調任上海市長，所遺中央宜傳部長一職，即將由十五日上午在國府舉行之中常會決定。又行政院翁副院長文灝堅決懇辭，經濟部長一職，聞繼任人選亦將由中常會與國防最高委員會討論決定。交通部長兪飛鵬，將另任新職，繼任人選聞以現任軍政部次長俞大維將軍呼聲最高。</p>
<p>〔本報杭州十四日電〕南京訊：中央決定田糧繼續徵收，機構或劃歸地方管轄，惟將於月底召集各省當局舉行之會議中決定，糧財兩部聞將台併，徐堪有任財長說。</p>

<h3>錢大鈞吳國楨促駕　市府各局處趕辦移交　淞滬警備總司令李及蘭亦辭職</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕新任上海市市長吳國楨，已由昨晨行政院例會通過，聞吳氏或將於本月二十日來滬視事，本市各界均將表示熱烈歡迎。錢市畏昨特致電促駕，原電云：「南京宣傳部長吳國楨兄勛鑒，密，閱報中央任兄爲上海市長，曷勝歡迎，幸祈魚軒速臨，俾得即行交替。敬電馳賀，並達下忱。弟錢大鈞辰寒。」又致電行政院宋院長請辭行政院上海各機關房屋分配委員會主任委員職，其原文如次：「南京行政院長宋鈞鑒；職懇辭上海市市長，定荷垂　。所有行政院上海各機關房屋分配委員曾主任委員，乞速指派人員接替，在未奉派以前，由彭副主任負責主持，敬乞鑒察。職錢大鈞辰寒。</p>
<p>據本報記者悉：錢市畏可能出任國民政府參軍長。各界對於錢市長在艱困複雜之環境下，重整此大都市，成極欽佩，今茲離去，亦感不勝依依。</p>
<p>又市府秘書長沈士華，財政局長浦拯東，衛生局長兪松筠，及地政局長陳石泉辭職，均已照准，經中樞通過，任命何副市長德奎任秘書長，現任郵政總局副局長谷春帆任財政局長，谷氏係財政金融專家，曾代表我國出席世界貨幣會議。前江蘇省土地局畏祝平任地政局長，祝氏對於土地問題，具卓越硏究，曾任中央政治學校地政糸敎授等職。新任衛生局長李廷安，係公共衛生專家，民二十六年曾任本市衛生局長職。據息：社會局長吳開先，工務局長趙祖康，及公用局長趙曾珏，則決不更動。現市府各局各處已奉市長令，趕速辦理移交事宜，移交辦法爲市府各處及本身手續，應造具詳細淸册，資產，人員數目，及一切　卷，送秘書處集合。已奉令調動之各局，則直接向繼任各該局移交，不經市府轉折辦理。不吏動之各局及各處，亦當辦理淸理手續，即所謂「假移交」。市府全體近日均忙於整理移交工作，期於二三日內辦理竣事。新聞處畏朱虛白，亦於昨日向市長提出辭呈，關於該處更動情事，將直接由中宣部核定。</p>
<p>據確悉：淞滬警備司令部總司令李及蘭，亦正請辭該職中。因上海爲國內唯一都會，環境特殊，人事紛紜，必須脚踏實地，淸楚認識後，方能有所見吿，語畢即向各記者拱手答謝，載笑載揖，步出會塲，各記者仍尾隨不捨，直將吳氏送上汽車而後散去。據新任上海市長吳國楨吿本報記者云，渠俟辦理交代後，即赴滬履新、爲期當不出週內。新任滬市財政，地政，衛生三局長，亦擬同時就職。渠認上海待做之事實多，但經錢市長半年餘不斷計劃，已有軌轍可資規隨渠信，市長乃人民公僕，到職之後，惟有以誠以信，爲主人做事，必忠必實，為國家努力。渠並鄭重囑託本報記者，願藉本報一角箋幅，轉告滬市父老，吳國楨做外交次長，宣傳部長，為了國家不憚詞費，吳國楨受任上海市長，為了同情那飽受八年餘欺騙壓榨痛苦的數百萬市民，「爲政不在多言」，只顯多做事。最後吳並叮　囑咐謂渠之岳父乃爲黃溥灌，渠之夫人係名黃卓羣，昨報有誤，可見其細心而切實。</p>

<p>〔本報南京十四日電〕頃向首都高院探悉：僞宣傳部長林逆柏生將於本月二十五日上午開審，聞屆時將效審訊陳逆公博時之放唱片助證，唱片將由中央廣播電合潘啓元供給，據潘氏稱，共收集到三張，乃係林逆赴日時之講演詞，現正整理中。</p>

<p>社論</p>
<h3>認清政治僵局的癥結</h3>
<p>馬歇爾特使，隨着國民政府遷回南京之後、從前天起，又開始與市府舉行會談，接着與中共代表周恩來面洽，首都空氣，對於中國大局，乃轉樂觀。一般人認為各黨派代表於日　到京之後，政治協商會議綜合小組會議就可重開。這當然是　局開朗的　兆，但聞中共一方面仍堅持以東北停戰爲重開談判的條件，一方面又在華北及沿綫到處發動攻勢，似乎令我們還不能樂觀過早。</p>
<p>記得一月間政治協商會議在渝開幕之際，正是全國衝突宜佈停止的時候，故得在和平的氛圍中進行協商，討論了二十餘　，屆然獲得各黨各派和社會賢達一致贊同的五項協議。協議的主要精神：（一）爲軍隊國家化，實行軍隊整編及統編中共部隊爲國軍之基本方案，永保國內的和平；（二）爲政治民主化，先　組國民政府容納各黨各派人士參加，然後，五月五日召開國　大會制定憲法，走上民主政治的正軌。但是，自政協閉幕以不，三個多月，不僅其所通過的協議並沒有州看見具體實行，就　全國朝野所一致期望的軍隊國家化和政治民生化的兩大原則，也似乎被一二個黨派忘得一乾二凈，而且政治局勢愈演愈糟，中共到處企圖擴充地盤，　無止境，也絕蕪已時。例如東北問題，在蘇聯軍撤退之後，中央軍隊開往接收，名正言順，理無異議；回東北忽有所謂「民主聯軍」的出現，更有所謂「長哈之戰」的發生，使不成問題的東北接收又陷於僵局。再如津　路北段以及蘇北一帶，中共部隊無處不蠶　欲動，使當地人民水深火熱，呼籲無門。其在政治方面，中共對於憲草有固執的意見，對於國民大會及國府改組，則先爭代表和國府委員的名額，後來索性藉口東北問題而拒不開出名單，結果使五月五日召開的國民大會不得不再度延期，改組政府也無從着手。</p>
<p>這種政治僵局，如果不速謀挽救，長此以往，足以釀成空前的危機。憂時愛國的人民，都應該提高警覺，正視現實，切不可再高談闊論，置身事外，漫無是非曲直之感。我們認爲第三者的人民不應該再這樣糊塗下去，而須首先認淸目前政治陷於僵局的　結究竟在什麽地方？明乎此，然後可以對症下藥，迫令違背民意者切實履行其諾言。</p>
<p>政協會最大的成就，當無過於軍隊的整編與統編之基本方案之擬訂，因爲軍政軍令不統一，絕對不能使國家政治上軌道的。而且前政治僵局的根本癥結，就在這個方案沒有澈底實行。這方案原來規定於十八個月內，逐步實施完成，其目的在乎减少軍費支出，促進國家經濟建設，並確立造成足以保衛國家之軍隊。十二個月終了，全國陸軍應爲一百零八師，共中由中共部隊編成者十八師，由政府部隊編成者九十師；及至十二個月之時期元畢後六個月內，政府軍應更縮編爲五十師，中共軍應更縮編爲十師。同時又由政府代表鄭介民中共代表葉劍英美方代表羅賓遜三人，組織軍事調處執行部，同赴北方各軍事相持地點視察，以實現和平與恢復交通。準此而論，全國各地，不論是東北·華北·華中·華南，都應該保持今年一月十三日停戰命令發生效力時的狀態，而不許有所移動。但是現在各地的情形，誰都知道與當時情况截然不同的了。周恩來竟說：一自該協定簽訂以來，東北局勢已爲之改觀」。以意度之，軍隊的整編與統編方案，在他已認爲不能適用於東北。全國各黨各派所協商成立的方案，居然可由中共一黨片面廢棄，而用武力來撕毀，則又何必再假惺惺的談判？所以目前政局陷於僵局的主因，乃在政協會的協凝已成爲僅僅一種意思的表示，而毫無拘束的力量。換言之，鄭重其事的政協會，缺少了一個强有力的執行協議的機構。雖然也設有軍事調處執行部，且有美國代表參加，到各地去視察但是也祗有視察而已，缺少一種强制的力量，談不到調處，更談不到執行。例如：執行小組曾到過華北·華中·東北以及蘇北各地，但是究竟執行了多少任務呢？又爲什麼不把究竟那一方違背命令那一方遵奉命令的實情向中國人民率直宣佈呢？連公道的宣怖，都不敢做，還有力量調處麼？還有力量執行處罰麼？最奇怪的，莫過於執行小組到了蘇北，竟由中共拒絕而不能「登堂入室」，這樣的執行小組，如何能希望它能執行停戰命令呢？最近鄂省原無衝突，而中共忽然大聲疾呼，謂政府軍包圍中共軍，又說華中就有大規模的戰事，要求執行小組前往視察，後來三人小組居然前去，但究竟中共所宣傳的確實與吾，三人小組又爲什麽噤若寒蟬，保守械默呢？又如東北原不在調處範圍之內，而共軍先則要求調處，待强佔長春以後，調處部奉令派小組前往，何以中共又說長春已無戰事，可以不必前去呢？我們長人民，日夜盼望謀國的各方，均能共同履行諾言，早日開始和平建國的工作。所以我們在水深火熱之中，忍著痛苦，提出下列數項建議：</p>
<p>第一，軍隊整編及統編共軍方案，不特應迅速普遍實施，同樣適用於東北，而且主張先從東北着手，最好能於最短期內整編完成。中共要求修改，絕無理由可言。唯有如此，東北問　題始有解決希望。也惟有從是否實行此方案，可以看出那一方面面是否謀求和平的誠意。</p>
<p>第二，加強執行小組的權力，不僅須有執行命令的權力，而且還應該有處罰違背一月十日停戰命令者的權力，不問違背命令是屬那一方面的部隊。我們希望謀國的各方，首先反省所屬軍隊是否停止於一月十三日之防棧，然後保證其軍隊對於軍事調處執行部所頒發之命令立即絕對運行。吾則一面衝突一面調處，昨日調處今日衝突，衝突無止境，調處無已時，徒勞無功，決不是人民的希望。</p>
<p>第三，目前為止，各處的衝突，幾無往而不是中共挑釁，但一旦挑釁目的達到，中共又即高唱「無條件停戰」，要政府和調人承認它的旣成事實。中共的手法誠極「高明」，但終不能以一手掩盡大下人的耳目。老百姓決不容許任何一方專門玩弄手法，而且今日的老百姓也決非昔日的「阿斗」。</p>
<p>第四，問題的癥結在於整軍方案未能實施，以致東北華北蘇北的衝突，層出不窮。這一個責任，究竟應該由那一方面去負？誰未履行諾言？誰在挑　？又誰先動手？這些問題，軍事調處執行部先談查問明白，吿知國人，使大家知道是非曲直之所在。天下事如果不講是非，專事敷衍，斷不能使事情有合理的解決，因爲「理」就是「是非曲直」之理。倘使是非不明，黑白不分，大家糊裹糊塗，只圖苟安了事，那麽正義公道蕩然無存，「理」已不能再講，還有什麽解決時局的「合理」辦法呢？</p>
<p>要之，如欲打開目前政治的僵局，非光加强實施整軍方案的機構不可，非從明辨是非判斷曲直的公道觀念出發不可。唯有如此，始能使各方不能不履行諾言，停止衝突，亦唯有如此，政府與中共朮行協商，始有光明的前途。似使國人看不淸這　點，個人忽略了這關鍵，只想在政府與中共之間糊糊塗塗的做和事老，而不以權力執行其合理的協議，則中國必受其害，百姓必遭其殃！</p>

<p>〔本報東京特派員十四日專電〕今日下午日戰犯審訊庭，繼續辯論個別審理戰犯問題，中國檢察官向哲濬發表談話，對日方辯護律師所稱中日間在一九四一年前並無戰事一點，加以駁斥。據謂，自一九三一年以還，中國人民即飽嘗日本戰爭禍首之迫害，此輩戰犯，必須受最嚴厲制裁，吾則不特和平無法維持，即日本人民亦必繼續受其荼毒。</p>
<p>又今日前外相東鄕出庭受審時，對其德籍妻子作苦笑。</p>
<p>〔聯合社東京十四日電〕遠東國際軍事法庭中國檢察官向哲濬氏，今日初次出庭。據稱：中國遭日本戰犯蹂躪，人民受害不淺，今將在國際軍事法庭伸張公道。自一九三一年九月十八日起，中國軍民遭日本殺害者不知凡幾，日本領袖誘導人民壓迫中國，希望法庭能在相當時間內，對被吿廿八人宣判，處以應得之罪。</p>
<h3>美籍律師強詞奪理　為四被告辯護　企圖脫卸大規模謀殺罪名</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社東京十四日電〕遠東國際法庭本日賡續開庭，審訊日戰犯。美籍首席辯護律師勃拉肯尼當代表日戰犯四名，即前首相平沼騏一郞：前外相松岡洋右，前外相（降書簽字者）重光葵，及前關東軍司令梅澤美治郞，對法庭資格問題提出責難。勃氏舉出理由三點：（一）最高法院當局證明戰爭，並非犯罪行爲；（二）在戰爭中殺死敵人，並非謀殺，並不較原子彈投落廣島之構成謀殺為甚；（三）國際條約如被違犯，則東京法庭無審判之資格。蓋此一法庭之法官團與檢察團均代表戰勝國家故也。檢察長季楠當加駁斥，謂法庭係由聯合各國代表組成，事實上等於世界法庭，僅軸心國代表除外而已。此際若欲由中立各國組成法庭，則踏遍地球難覓，除非吾人向另一星球求之。澳洲檢察官孟斯斐特則稱，在正當戰爭與不正當戰爭之間，及侵略戰爭與防禦戰爭之間應有分別，在不正當之戰爭中殺死敵人，即爲謀殺。</p>
<h3>日皇宮前飢民示威</h3>
<p>要求日皇發給糧食</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社東京十四日電〕本日有日本人的七百名，手執紅旗，高唱國際歌，企圖閙入皇宮請願。此輩於午前十一時十五分到達宮門前，高呼「吾等要求國皇發給糧食」，侍衛攔阻未果，卒許代表五人入內，但五代表僅會見宮內省代表，由其轉達彼等之要求而已。其餘示成者在門外候至五時半，一鬨而散。同日午後，示威遝動有如潮湧，參加羣眾達百萬人之眾。據入宮之代表一人訴怨稱：「戰爭期間吾人準備爲國皇而死，此刻國皇聽任吾等飢餓而死，於心何忍？」一日本警察答之曰：「君欲糧食，你不如往求麥克阿瑟元帥爲佳」。</p>
<h3>美國務院裂痕日增　外交政策受影響　傳統的新舊派傾軋未已　中美情報司長因此辭職</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓十三日電〕美國務院內部包藏之裂痕，正在日見擴大，此於美國各種重大外交政策，或不免發生嚴重影響。此一重大問題，他日國務卿貝爾納斯自巴黎歸來，自須加以應付。因此傾軋而首先辭職者爲中美情報司長麥克柯麥克上校，其辭職原因，據稱係由於國務院內部之反對，使其一籌莫展。國務院各司現在揣測紛紜，不調某某將繼之辭職，即謂年內將有大事調動，其有辭職可能者，一般揣測大抵集中於副國務卿艾克遜，國務卿助理克萊頓，及麥克柯麥克繼任人郞傑。傾軋癥結，即爲傳統的新舊派之爭，亦即職業的外交家與比較新進人物之爭是也。職業的外交官以爲美國對外關係各部門應由其主持，俾使某一種政策，能以充量加以推行，有始有終，不致中途變卦。其他非職業的外交官大抵爲法學家及經濟學家則以爲美國必須發展一種　前進的外交政策路綫，不能僅以外交家所供給者爲限，美國如不能促成一種可行的和平，則舉世茫茫何團能荷此重任。為完成此種方針，若輩必須誠心誠意設法與蘇聯合作。反之，職業的外交官方針，若輩必須誠心誠意設法與蘇聯合作。反之，職業的外交官則主張對蘇向西歐擴展勢力，採取堅決態度加以反對。艾克遜，克萊頓及郎傑諸人，均爲國務院中非職業的外交官官（按前駐華大使赫爾利曾指艾克遜爲職業的外交官）。</p>

<h3>參議員提出證據　美軍機保護不密　法制會擬修改間諜法</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓十三電〕參議員　利，聞今日曾在參院法制委會秘密會議提出驚人證據，揭露美國軍機保護不密。韋利並稱：專門工程知識與秘密武器，同具重大軍事秘密價値。該委員會現擬於本月十七日草成法案，將三十年前頒行之間謀法予以修正，俾適合富代關於雷達及原子彈秘密之用。該委員會並接得下列各項證詞：（一）蘇聯曾擬與某某電器製造公司訂立合同，並規定由各該公司准許蘇聯工程師到廠實習。（二）美國商務部曾隨意出售許多專門紀錄，自德國搜獲者亦在內，此項紀錄，陸海軍當局雖認爲無秘密性質，但蘇聯與法並不照辦。</p>
<p>據該委員會主席依斯脫曼稱：認爲無秘密性質者之部份，如加以彙集即成爲秘密資料。美政府應設立專局審查外國政府在美所訂合同云。</p>

<p>〔法國新聞社倫敦十三日電〕艾德禮首相今日在下院宜稱，余對於西姆拉會議所發表之公報，無所補充，截至目下爲止，亦未向內閣訪印代表團頒發新訓令。此間消息靈通人士相信艾德禮首相當於十五日在下院發表演說，報吿印度局勢。其內容與內閣代表團所發表之公報不相出入，換言之，即西姆拉談判並未破裂，內閣代表團且準備提出新建議，以打開僵局。</p>

<p>〔聯合社巴黎十四日電〕可靠人士今日聲稱：外長會議英法兩國代表願接受特里埃斯特港國際化，以便挽回會議僵局。惟美蘇兩國堅次反對，不願退讓。美國對此間題原擁護英法兩國，今則意見不同，堅主特港仍由義國保持，蘇聯主張特港應割讓南國，亦極堅堅次。美方人稱，此一問題爲對義和的不獲協議之主要癥結。</p>

<h3>試驗原子彈時　引起地震？　扭歪地形？　美專家認係杞人之憂</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓十三日電〕耶魯大學物理學敎授鄔婁博士，曾向紐的時報投函，以比基尼珊瑚島試騐原子炸彈時，恐將引起地震，其爲害將不堪設想，因而認爲選擇該島作爲試騐之處，實屬不智。其憂慮之理論，則爲原子彈炸裂時或將擊破太平洋底，使海水衝入，與地心熱力接觸，致引起迎續不斷之地震，其震動力量之大，足使地球失去均衡，地形亦隨之扭歪，此種連續性之地震，並足以引起海嘯，使潮水湧起一哩或一哩以上之高度。記者今日以此訊之陸海軍試騐部隊副司令派森海軍少將，及海洋學家兼試騐顧問勒維爾海軍中將，此兩專家即檢出地震，海底地理及巨大爆炸之紀錄與統計，以證明鄔婁博士之理論，實屬杞人之憂，不足爲訓。其解釋如下：</p>
<p>（一）人造原子彈之爆炸，其力雖堪驚人，若與天然的地震或地裂相較，猶不過小巫之見大巫，大地震一次所產生之能量，較原子彈一枚所產生者約十萬倍，地震所產生之能量盡入地中，原子彈所產生之能量吸收入地者僅千分之一。以此推算，大地震所產生之能量約大於原子彈所產生之能量一萬萬倍。</p>
<p>（二）假定比基尼區域有火山層存在（惟試騐主管人員並不作此假定，）則在第二次外長在此一年內仍不獲解決，則將此問題提交聯合國機構。此外，四國應合組一委員會，由盟國管制德國委員會授權，赴德國四個佔領區，視察德國解除武器已至何種程度。</p>
<h3>義新王以勳章　贈我駐義代辦</h3>
<p>遜王改稱波倫索伯爵</p>
<p>〔中央社倫敦十三日電〕義大利新王安伯托第二，昨於羅馬接見我駐義代辦薛光前，並贈以高級官員勳章，新任駐義大使于焌吉可望於廿三日左右抵羅馬。</p>
<p>〔中央社紐的十三日專電〕我駐義大使于焌吉定十三日夜乘輪赴南安普敦轉往羅馬。試騐時原子彈在水面稍下處爆炸，此種火山層尙在爆炸處之下二萬一千餘呎，二萬一千呎即爲比基尼珊瑚礁距離出太平洋底之高度，該礁係位於一高峯之上，即使該高峯昔係一活火山，其噴火之山心必早行凝結，高峯現已成爲嚴石，山頂及斜坡盡蓋一厚層珊瑚。</p>
<p>（三）比基尼周圍二千餘哩之內可信其絕無活火山存在。</p>
<p>（四）如謂火山爆發有扭歪地形之可能，則「此地球如此敏感，已往多少次海嘯地震定必使其够受用矣」。如以一八八三年蘇門答臘爪哇區克拉加土地裂而論，當海水滲入島下超熟基地時，爆裂之石計達十四方哩。克拉加土位於赤道之南六度，地裂如有影響地形之可能，則該處地裂已足以影響地球之旋轉矣。需要。菲列賓於同期內需要六萬噸，朝鮮亦需要十一萬噸。印度洋區同期內之最低需要量為八十八萬六千噸。胡佛反對應由美國完全負担救荒責任。西半球雖當盡力協助，但印度洋區亦應儘量動員其資源。</p>
<p>胡佛報告書中謂，自五月一日至九月三十日爲止，世界需要糧食共一千四百四十八萬四千噸，同期內可能之供應量則爲一千零八十九萬七千噸，故缺少約三百六十萬噸。胡佛於記者招待會上復稱，爲避免集體飢饉起見，需要不斷之努力，余相信在八月底以前，各過剩國家若能加緊　節，並保持合作之精神，則其餘不足之額，必不難大部份凑足。</p>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓十四日電〕胡佛已徇杜魯門總統之請，將以糧食特使之名義，赴南美訪問，覓取南美各國協助救濟世界糧荒。</p>

<p>印奸兩名再度開審</p>
<p>提籃格高院二樓特刑庭，昨晨再審印奸那那克昌，與鮑培。那那克昌早年參加印度獨立運動，爲英政府追捕，乃潛逃來滬，民國三十年冬，鮑斯勾結日軍，在我陷區內組織印度獨立同盟會，領導印僑爭取獨立。那那克昌即任主席。鮑培請日語。任敵聯絡員。二奸媚敵發表荒謬言論，乘機歛財。上年印人吳華足·那侖星。華哈威星。等均到庭，供述被害經過。被吿猶圖推諉責任，並謂彼之充任該職，不過政治觀念不同，其爲爭取獨立則也。庭諭被吿還押改期再訊。</p>

<h3>救濟失業固重要　搶救工廠更迫切　吳開先談召開生產會議謀解決</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕吳開光氏談：目前如何救濟失業工人固屬重要，但搶救工廠更爲迫切。有工廠才可以設法容納工人。故特聯合各有關機關，籌備另開生產會議以謀解決。今擬於會議中提出討論者爲：（一）請求政府舉辦鉅額工業貸金，用以改善或添置各民營工廠之設備，並用以購置生產原料。（二）幫助督促各工廠改善人事管理。現據統計，勝利後一部份工廠之職員，的較敵僞時期增多三分之一，今裁減不必要之冗員，設法多容納工人。（三）採辦洋米以抑平米價。此爲根本問題，與工商業前途有莫大關係。（四）整飭勞工紀律。吳氏又談：勞資評斷委員會成立後，除已一度集會外，最近期內，將再度召開。又吳氏因蔣主席召見中國勞動協會負責人朱學範氏，特於昨晚陪同赴京晋謁。</p>

<h3>女騙子王國英開審　着西裝南髪大聲喊冤　當庭對質　互爭「良心」</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕女騙子王國英與孫公度，張慰生二人，共同欺詐他人財產案，經地檢處提起公訴，起訴書要旨已誌七日本報。昨日下午二時半，由曹推事祖慰，開地院刑三庭，首次提審。王國英薙男式西髮，衣淺灰色西裝，打紅色白點領帶，足登乳黃色皮鞋，與孫張二犯，同由張驥，潘祝鵬二司法警官帶至被吿席內，對起訴書所稱欺詐事，全部狡賴，大聲說是寃枉。經曹推事一一傳訊後，論改期再審，被吿還押。</p>
<p>保釋漢奸罪嫌藉端敲詐家屬</p>
<p>王氏爲北平人，回敎徒，三十四歲，住金門飯店七一四號，自稱為國民政府主計處專員，係來滬募捐救濟難民款項。今年四月三日，經其同鄉孫公度（四十四歲），與張慰生（四十七歲北通州人）之介紹，爲保釋犯漢奸罪嫌之吳永華，藉故敲詐其家屬，先後共得五百萬元，而吳逆仍未釋放。同時孫公度欲平分臟款未果，遂據情報吿警局，將王逮捕。開審時，曹推事先傳訊證人亞永祿（北平人，五十歲，業運輸），經閱警局之供訊筆錄後，叙述其應王國英之請，赴東方飯店三四一號王之兄佐民處送船票，見孫公度正與王之兄嫂爭吵，謂不拿回二百五十萬元，對不住朋友經他排解，但否認曾說由王與孫共同騙得五百萬元。</p>
<p>當庭故作驚訝　說是不認識她</p>
<p>繼傳吳永華之妻俞杏賡（浙江餘姚人，三十二歲，住威海衛路三六七號），供稱曾見過王國英二次：一在東新橋南來順羊肉館，一在德記五金號樓上，是由張慰生介紹，但未說話。並稱張爲其十餘年來之鄰居，秉性爽直，相信張是好人，不會加害。經張之一再申說，謂一定可以保釋其夫吳永華，而孩子病篤，很望能見其夫，故遂付三百萬元。至另外由德記五金號墊付之二百萬元，她不知道。亦不識王國英，與孫公底更不相識。嗣訊徐鄒巧英（常熟人，四十歲，住威海衛路三三三號，其夫爲吳永華之學生）據供：四月五日王國英赴她家取二百萬元時，曾見一面。時王氏穿藍色旗袍，並不穿西裝。曹推事又傳訊王國英，她否認如故，即令被吿與證人當庭對質，王氏故作驚訝，竟說：「我根本不認識她們！」然未能完全掩飾其慌張。</p>
<p>完全碍於情面為了好心幫忙</p>
<p>曹推事間她兄姊在滬，爲何要住兩個旅館？答：「他比我晚到，金谷飯店已無房間」。問：「結過婚嗎」？答：「結過婚，丈夫陳維彥，在河內，做軍政部駐河內辦事處參謀」。問：「證人都對你無仇，爲什麽都要說你有此事」？答：「我受高等敎育，不敢違法，此事完全寃枉」。問：「受敎育到何程度」？答：「北平平民大學新聞系畢業」。嗣由曹推事令王與孫公度，張慰生對質，王稱因不曾答應孫公度投資經商，致遭此陰謀，而孫稱要求退回二百五十萬元，完全爲了礙於情面，必須還給原王，絕非分贓。至張慰生則謂完全山於好心帮忙，何敢欺詐？被告席內，三犯互爭良心，不知良心究在誰身上。曾推事以時間關係，停止審訊。王國英强求訴說內情，爲曹推事所止，令其可撰辯護狀呈上。王所延馬楠庚律師請求被吿交保，亦不獲准。庭諭十六日下午二時再訊。</p>

<h3>駐懷十二防毒大隊　無故槍殺中學生　懷中全體學生向全國痛切呼籲　蚌埠各中學連日自動募款恤</h3>
<p>〔本報懷遠專訊〕懷遠向爲皖北文化中心，自七七事變，淪陷敵手，一切建設，摧毀殆盡。勝利以後，皖敎總派周平爲校長，在　創辦省立懷遠中學，救濟皖北失學靑年，當時因校舍校具全無，而敎廳經費短絀，無力支付，乃一面暫假私立淮西中學女生部上課，一面捐募款項，蒐集器材，以備建校之需。嗣經該縣仕紳決議，拆除縣城內外荒廢廟宇，補助建築。該校學生以建校殷情，不惜犧牲時間，隨同校長敎師，搬磚運瓦，已非一日。</p>
<p>不分皂白開槍射擊</p>
<p>本月八日下午，全體師生，又赴渦河北岸大王廟，搬取建校器材，往來渡口間。其時適遇軍政部駐懷軍第十二防毒大隊所封大船一隻靠岸，該隊即徵伕搬貨，强迫該校校工參加。該校學生以各有專責，上前理論，該隊士兵竟口出不遜，嗚槍射擊，並將該校童訓教官，曁學生多人捆綁浸水，凌辱備至。一時校長周平由河北趕至南岸，尋得該隊傳中隊長尙勇，婉言交涉，一塲風波，遂吿平息。學生等復遵敎師命令，繼續搬取工作，不疑有他，孰意突由城內衝出該隊士兵卅餘人，由分隊長胡中桂率領，荷槍實彈，如臨大敵，馳到「水門口一渡口，不分皂白，開槍射擊。該校師生赤手空拳，無法抵抗，致學生袁永錕當塲殞命，孫明德彈入腹中，情勢危急，阮振華傷背斷筋，勢成殘廢，李廣義被刺刀戳傷，其餘輕傷落水者，不在少數。</p>
<p>軍紀可存民命何侍</p>
<p>此一幕慘絕人寰之武劇切齒。頃該校全體學生，發表宣言，向全國痛切呼籲，略謂：「國家養兵，本爲保境安民，今竟憑藉武力，殘殺學生，視法律爲弁髦，，等人命於芻狗，軍閥餘孽，不至於此，若不嚴究主使，法辦兇徒，軍紀何存？民命何恃？我省立懷中全體同學，爲愛校，愛國，愛同胞，誓以全力扶植正義，寗爲王碎，不爲瓦全。望我全國人士，主張公道，保障敎育，保障靑年，賜予聲援！」云云。</p>

<h3>陳紹賢由南洋視察歸國　報告華僑教育情形　馬來亞華僑學校恢復最速</h3>
<p>〔本報香港訊〕此問敎育界，八日下午三時，假香港大酒店茶會，歡迎新近由南洋過港日內返國之參政員陳紹賢，陳氏年初奉命代表敎育部赴南洋各地視察僑民敎育，幷與各該當地政府商洽發展僑敎等有關問題。是日到會者，有港九各校校長代表黃祖芬等四十餘人。主席袁稅伯致詞歡迎，繼由陳紹賢報吿視察觀感，據謂：政府因亟欲知悉，經被敵摧殘三年有餘之南洋各地僑校情形，及戰事期間敎育界人士爲正義犧牲史實，乃派本人前往，計今將達四月。當余於離渝啓程時，滿不想及南洋各地僑校復員之迅速，現僑校復校雖未達半數，然學生人數比率則較前爲多。</p>
<p>羅方面</p>
<p>罷於過去數年，完全為敵控制，其政府對我華僑，視同敵人，學校之被封査，敎員之被拘捕，爲數至多，自敵降後，情形已吿好轉。當吾人抵達之時，暹羅排華之空氣仍甚濃厚，因此正式學校尙未有一家復課，但「私塾」則甚多。最近我國經與暹訂有友好條約，今後當可恢復太平洋戰前之狀態，按大戰前我在暹僑校爲一六九所。</p>
<p>緬甸方面</p>
<p>緬甸方面，原有僑校三四七所，至一月時，經復校者六十三所。馬來亞所屬檳榔嶼，戰前原有學校二二一所，其中有兩所中學，至二月已全部復校外，有九十所小學亦復課。</p>
<p>南洋方面</p>
<p>霹靂有二三九所，中學八所，至二月已復校者一〇九所，其中兩所爲中學。星加坡原有二七七所，中學七所，至三月復校者九十七所，中學二所，越南三四九所，中學四所，已復校一五〇所。</p>
<p>愛國心切</p>
<p>陳氏指出戰後華僑經濟極度拮澀，如樹膠·錫鑛·米業均受政府統制，軍票廢用，致使有產者破產，然基於數年被敵寇壓迫，僑胞愛國之心更切，而對敎育事業之協助發展，尤加倍努力。即以自下讀中國文之風熾盛，可爲一例。過去不少華僑子弟，祗讀外國文，對本國文字不予注意之觀念，已完全洗除。因而學童較前爲多，而一學校有供不應求之現象。</p>
<p>今後改善</p>
<p>今後僑校之待改善者，爲學校設備，教學方法，僑敎課程，學生國文程度之提高等等。陳氏並主張政府宜多派人員前往視癩，並在若干　要地方成立聯絡機構，使僑民對於祖國敎育情形獲得更多了解。國時國內擅長國語之敎師，亦爲海外需求。陳氏同時報吿彼於視察各地時，均曾與當地政府，在友好和洽之氣氛下商談改善僑敎問題，特別在星加坡所提出者至多，如政府補助金問題等等，均獲友邦之充份協助云。陳氏在港逗留數日後，即返廣州轉京。</p>
<p>改變觀念</p>
<p>〔中央社廣州十三日電〕記者今訪甫由南洋視察歸國之中委陳紹賢，據談：羣僑學校恢復，以馬來亞進度最速，越南次之，緬甸又次之，三地復校總數，僅達戰前之半，惟學生人數則相等。暹羅正式學校，尙未恢復，祇有私熟‘餘所。戰後華僑，均重視子弟敎育，彼等咸覺我國國際地位，業已提高，故一改戰前使子弟專習英文之不良觀念，而以其子弟改入僑校，各校學生今已激增云。</p>
<h3>美國中小學正式承認　報紙為輔助課本　增加學生對課程之興趣</h3>

<h3>中央銀行隨機　金價昨已平定　美鈔隨金市轉移</h3>
<p>哈赤昨稍平定，晨開仍哄高至一八五萬左右，但為時至暫，逢高不乏福利了結者，不久即退至回升，終以中行壓力增加，美鈔方面仍有套賣供源，曾跌至一七五萬以下，始有維持，十時左右在一七八萬光景，中行對同業登記二九一條，即以一七八萬之價配給，業中以價格過高，紛請退貨，此後形勢平穩，一度回升至一八二萬，但不久乃感受壓力而轉盤，午刻仍在配給價左右徘徊，　赫一時之金潮，至此漸歸平定，午後銀樓實銷平呆，風平浪靜，無甚變化，結果較前收回跌二萬五，飾金十九萬，紋銀一千七，銀元一一〇〇元有賣，暗拆銀根稍鬆，息價自一角半至一角八分。</p>
<p>外幣美鈔平庸，隨金市進退，晨開後自二三五〇元左右步降至二二七〇元光景，午刻在二三〇〇元前後掙扎，套頭價拔開至七七〇元左右，投機行動重金輕鈔，有以致之，午後金市已定，美鈔仍在二三〇〇元內外徘徊，結果較前收回挫二十元，港票平疲，結果老貨跌二元，新貨跌五元，港匯自四二〇元退至四一〇元，羅比五二〇元有賣，美匯仍平。</p>
<h3>公債繼續上漲　華股時現秀色</h3>
<p>公債仍趨向榮，但形勢恍惚，統丙晨開平盤，開後大戶買胃續殷，逐步抬高至七七〇〇元左右，多頭始有一部份滿意退休市價遂告回落，午刻在七三五〇元光景徘徊，結果較前收續漲二五〇元，甲乙亦帶好一五〇元，丁戊各漲一百元，華股有業中大戶不時拉提，冀挽還殘局，中途時現秀色，最高價永紗爲五二五〇元，美亞四三五〇元，景福三五五元，新光二九五元，勤興二五〇元，對敵大戶對小股聊備一格，並不注意，影響散戶游資不少，大股亦失却倚托，午刻仍感不支而退，各股都以低價結束，結果較前收計永紗美亞無甚出入，景福等三小股則續微挫，中型榮辱不一，小型冷門則稍回好，元老股仍難推進，供過於求難獲對手，午後形勢岑寂，外股仍隨證劵帮意旨所左右，外商靜觀居多，最後亦感不支，怡紗上塲在前收價以上對做，開後逐漸被多方了結所壓制而微降，紙業有證券幫小型游資套買，尙感穩定，餘均以微跌姿態結束。</p>

<p>又訊，中央信託局代理出售政府物資財產委員會第二次標賣紗布人造絲等貨，內有紗綫四組，每組的三四十件，均由恒康紗號以最高價標得，其價與市上做價不相上下。</p>

<h3>米市惡作劇　前日略事休息　昨又猛力前進</h3>
<p>昨日米市來源尙有，惟店胃轉暢，消化靈活，米市塲突起漲風，開盤頂上白粳，即喊四萬八千元至四萬九千元，買戶蜂擁成交興旺，繼續升漲，旋破五萬元大關，雖豆米業公會將棧貨到貨在塲拋售，仍無濟於事，收盤白粳高至五一五〇〇元，頂上薄稻漲至五二〇〇元，平均市價較前上升三千五百元之譜，麵粉亦受米價上升關係，人心趨挺，續升四五百元，黃豆供求兩不見旺，奈貨主甚堅，亦加五六百元，豆餅早挺午懈，略升百元，麩皮去化不振，生仁依然平庸，苞米靑島去胃不濃，市形穩定，汕市到消兩平，生豆油暫乏榮辱，惟淸菜油貨稀挺秀，價漲千餘元，昨日本市到米據米市塲息，共四千餘担，其種類及石數如下，白粳一，八七五石，薄稻六九九石，早稻八四五石，羊秈一三〇石，杜秈五三〇石，蕪秞一七九石，白元三〇石，陰元一〇石</p>

<h3>美國維持生產效率　必須輸入原料</h3>
<p>〔美國新聞處華盛頓十三日電〕據美國國際貿易局主任保羅稱，美國必須輸入不少貨物，以補尤其本國之生產而維持製造之效牽，美國對於不少重要材料必須仰給於外國之輸入，例如汽車一項，其鋼鐵與玻璃，雖產於美國，但底特律汽車製造商所用之軟不，來自阿爾及利亞，皮革來自阿根廷，山羊毛來自小亞細亞，錫與橡皮，來自婆羅洲或馬尼刺，蟲膠溶成之薄片來自印度，錫礦來自中國，統計製成一輛汽車，需要原料的三百種，來自七十五個不同之國家，保氏稱：美國之輸入爲各國獲得美元之主要途徑，藉以購買美國貨物，實際上各國皆生產美國所需要之一部份貨物。保氏稱：欲使國際貿易機構工作順利，各國必須設法减少而終於撤去貿易之障碍，包括過高之稅率，經濟壁壘，足以成為政治與社會之壁壘，而結果將引起各國間不必要之惡感。</p>
<h3>華北出口貨　豬鬃較有希望</h3>
<p>〔路透社天津十四日電〕美國官方主辦之「國外商務週報」論述華北貿易現况稱：自日本投降以來，因天津與山東，內蒙古及華西等產區之鐵路交通繼續斷絕，實際上絕無羊毛運抵天津。預料一九四六年度可能運到之少數羊毛，祇够供給當地之需要，在相當時期內不致有羊毛可供出口。査一九三六年度，天津曾對美輸出羊毛二千五百萬磅。此外，在今後半年或九個月以內，不致有過剩之棉花可供出口。一九四五—四六年度之棉花收成估計約有五十萬担，祇及當地紗廠需要重之四分之一。豬鬃業受日軍干涉之影響最少，可供出口之數量約有一萬至一萬五千箱。天津皮貨產量較大，但山羊皮存貨不多，無出口希望。天津之　毯業，因工人四散，原料缺乏及機器損壞等原因，前途困難滋多。該報結論謂：天津之對外貨之購買力，因其出口能力薄弱而减少，故進口業之恢復希望亦殊暗淡云。</p>

<h3>謎樣的米散賑問題　廣州米價　突破十萬關</h3>
<p>— 本報十一日廣州航訊　特派員梁風</p>
<p>誰也不能否認，戰事帶來了貧困，疾病和飢餓，而且飢懺的惡魔，實比一切都要殘忍。現在，這飢餓的惡魔巨掌，正抓着了廣州全市，使百萬市民都受到飢餓的威脅。</p>
<p>竹樹花　充作食物</p>
<p>廣州的糧荒，本不自今日開始，不過目前米價的高漲，恐已超越全國了。從上月二十日起至本月二日，竟由每担四萬餘元而突升至十萬元以外。因此，人心惶惶，社會不安，造成一片恐怖的景象，不但勞苦大衆，無法度日，就一般中上人家，亦大感不易維持，雖還未至於吃草根樹皮，但採取竹樹花來充飢的早已大有人在。街頭餓殍日凡五六十人，較强有力的爲生存掙扎，每强搶途人手携的食物。各米店和食物店老闆們，都在時時刻刻防範着一班「飢餓的暴徒」。報章上還刋載過一個驚人的消息：「共黨於本月初派人以重資分頭在四鄉及沙基米市，大量搜購糧食，秘密運至各處囤積，以刺激糧價，陰謀在米似漲至每百元二兩以下時，即發動市內流氓乞丐，紐織搶米搶飯團，企圖造成恐怖，擾亂社會秩序……」所以在「五四」那天，學生紀念「五四運動巡行，當行列經過惠愛路的時候，那些神經過敏的米店老闆，都不的而同地將店門關上，後來知道是學生巡行，這才恢復常態。由此也可見這裏嚴重恐慌狀態的一斑了。</p>
<p>星期一　改吃雜糧</p>
<p>爲了糧荒問題，當局可以說早就相當注意，也曾發動過一次抗旱救災運動，並推行糧食節約運動，全市各界逢星期一必須改吃雜糧。可是，這一切消極的辦法，都不能遏抑米價的高漲。於是省府的實業公司又會同省市商會糧食公會等，組織所謂「糧食聯營行」，計劃向鄰省各本省各縣採購米糧回市接濟，並在四月廿五日開始實行管制糧食，設立糧食市塲，要全市糧商都集中在該市塲交易，由田糧處。社會局派員指導，以防一般奸商操縱，而穩定糧情，其用意本來最善，可是，那「營行」和「糧食市塲』開辦以後，米價不但不下降，相反地却還暴漲起來，竟會三天之間，每祖漲三四萬元之數，創造了最新的紀錄。於是，問題便越來越嚴重了。如果這樣下去，眞的不知伊於胡底，社會秩序更屬無法維持的了。</p>
<p>三級跳　無法抑止</p>
<p>黨政軍當局爲了這個問題，大家都感到頭痛，迎日不斷的召集各有關機關舉行關於調節糧食的緊急會議，商討救濟糧荒和平抑米價的辦法，羅主席和省黨部先後電請中央救濟，行營方面則極力減縮軍糧（自從將日俘日僑韓僑遣送回國及一部份國軍調走以後，現已由十三萬大包減爲六萬五千大包），並下令嚴禁部隊直接採購軍糧以免刺激糧價，省府亦同時貼出及在各報登載皇皇佈吿，引申國民政府頒佈「非常時期違反糧食管理治罪暫行條例」，如有對於糧食囤積居奇，投機操縱，助漲糧價，擾亂市塲，有害民生者，必以嚴令制裁……。在粵的國大代表，運日也在召開救濟糧荒會議，並推定林翼中。陸幼剛。伍智梅。胡木閘等四代表及田糧處處長蕭次尹赴京呼籲。述本市新聞記者公會，都天天在開會討論協助政府解救糧荒問題。可是，今天一個會，明天一個會，天天在開會，依然無法抑止米價的「三級跳」哩！</p>
<p>羅米　賑濟貧民</p>
<p>四月下旬，來了一個好消息，就是暹羅華僑爲救濟本省糧荒而捐助的暹米四千噸已經抵粵了。這四千噸暹米，除了二千噸運往汕頭五百噸運往海南島以外，還有一千五百噸是在廣州散賑，救濟赤貧的市民。爲了這批米，組織了一個散賑委員會，準備十萬張米票，發給赤貧及失業的貧苦市民，由五月一日起開始散賑，每人持票便可領到十八市斤的暹米。這消息傳來，一般貧苦市民，自然無不額手稱慶。照理，有這一千五百噸米糧調劑市面，米價應該下跌的，但事情恰巧相反，不但這批暹米之來，對抑平米價毫無影響，反而開始散賑之日，正是米價暴漲之時，五月二日竟突破了十萬大關，這不是怪事嗎？</p>
<p>糙碎米　形跡可疑</p>
<p>本來，四月下句報章天天在披露暹米濟粵的消息，而米價反而天天在上漲，這已經使人有點莫明其妙。後來再傳了一個消息，（在事情未證實前，或者可以說是謠言）說：有人將這批暹米在香港賣了，現在要在本市搜購一千五百噸本地米來散賑，因而米價因爲他們的搜購而暴漲。同時，現在所散賬的米，有六七種之多，有好的，有壞的，壞的不祗是糙米和碎米，而且還帶着不少的米糠，據說這種米簡直燒不成飯的，從這樣看來，使大家似乎都相信這個將遏米賣了而就地搜購各種不同的米來塡補的消息，是一個事實。究竟這一批散賑的是不是暹米呢。大家都在懷疑。</p>
<p>粵分署　眾矢之的</p>
<p>這樣一來，幾乎將整個糧荒問題，都集中到暹米問題上面去。黨政軍聯席會議更組織調査團來澈査救濟米在港轉售情形。這批　米是由善後救濟粵分署發出的。粵分署過去爲了救濟不力而爲社會人士指責，而這回又是他們負責的，於是善救分署更成爲「眾矢之的」了。</p>
<p>五月八日，善救署審議會的各界招待會在行營會議廳舉行，由行營主任張發奎將軍主席，因爲他是審議會的主任委員哩。不過，他首先就聲明，他雖然是審頗會的主委，但實際救濟工作是由　救分署辦理的。所以當天的主角，實在還是善救分署的署長凌道揚先生。當他報吿過一會分署的工作以後，大家的質詢便　　開槍一般的放起來了。大家都在嚷：「暹米那裏去了？」「究竟現在散賑的是不是暹米？」國大代表李德軒還將現在散賬五種不同的米五小包來給大家硏究。不過凌署長的答復是：在粵負責救濟的機關，除了粵分署以外，還有另外四個直屬「行總」的機稱，就是九龍儲運局，廣州　運處，購銷處，公路運輸處等，這次的暹米，是完全由九龍儲運局直接交與廣州儲運處的，在職權上因爲不相統屬，所以無從過問云云。這顯然是將責任完全推掉了。</p>
<p>馬處長　大受質詢</p>
<p>於是大家的目光，便轉移到廣州儲運處去，然那天該處處長馬是有意的躱起來。席上的羅翼羣中委提出：「打電話請馬處長馬上來！」參政員張良修和官褘更連聲低喊「要扣留」，空氣便越來越緊張了。終於馬處長應召趕到，大家便又提出嚴重的質詢，馬處長則堅決否認有將　米在港轉售情事。那時時間已不早了，但仍然未得到一個確實的答案，這答案大槪有待於黨政軍聯席會議調査團的報吿，相信總有一天會「水落石出」吧。</p>
<p>關於暹米舞弊的事情，當然空穴來風，未必無因。但假如將來澈査之後，認爲暹米並無舞弊的話，那末，爲什麽米價會這樣暴漲呢？那自然又有其他的原因作祟了！</p>
<p>甘霖降　糧價稍回</p>
<p>在暹米舞弊眞相未白時，我們暫且不談，但本市米價暴漲的形成，記者從各方調査，據熟悉米市情形者談，大的還有下列幾個因素：（一）本省各縣春季苦旱，而存糧日少，求過於供，糧商和富戶互相爭購，遂激起糧價。（二）不但本省缺糧，就外省亦感糧缺，無從接濟。（三）政府無糧在手，空言管制，行之不得其法，如糧食市塲，報價非離市情過高，則公價太低，致各江谷米日疏來省，（四）軍糧雖減少，但全在市面搜購。顧及軍食，則無法平抑民糧。（五）本市專營糧號，大者百餘家，均量入爲出，將原有存額保持，不拋出而調節，無異囤積居奇。（六）糧商大部游資，參入炒買，乃掀起千丈高潮，影響大衆心理，有者按盤，無者競購，益使市面糧情恐慌紊亂。除了這六種原因之外，還有人這樣說，這次操縱糧價的，實有不少官僚資本參與其間。當然，我們希望這祗是一個猜測，或者是一種謠言。</p>
<p>雖然，這兩天來，甘霖忽降，呈象可望消除，糧價亦已開始下跌，現在祗徘徊在六七萬元之間，但糧食浮動的暗影，似乎還在存留，這祗有望賢明的當局善爲處置了。</p>
<h3>湘省政在轉變中　新舊主席作風迥異　王東原為救災而來</h3>
<p>— 本報五日長沙航訊　特派員高元禮寄</p>
<p>醖釀將近兩月的湖南省政府改組問題，直到上月中旬行政院才正式發表。湖北省政府主席王東原氏調主湖南，接着不久，各廳長委員亦相繼更動，留任的廳長僅敎育廳長王鳳喈一人，新省府陣容整齊，湘省人士耳目爲之一新，無疑的得到各方的好評，認爲是復原期中最健全的省府。</p>
<p>前主席吳奇偉受命於危難之際，建立省府於戰時省會　陵，那一階段，任何人都知道極爲艱苦，原省府遠在藍山嘉禾，接收都沒有辦法，連省府和各廳處的印信都沒有。吳主席在沅陵發號施令，極不方便，而且組織又不健全，一切都可說是因陋就簡。但是面對着的是要配合反攻的軍事，責任又極重大，幸爲時不久，敵人投降，沅陵省府和湘南的省府才搬回長沙會合，組織才算完成。可是復員的工作，又緊逼而來，千頭萬緒，應付處理都須極端愼重。吳氏素以好好先生見稱，做事的作風雖不如何積極，但也不見得如何消極。湖南的人民就在這旣不積極又不消極裏面，自力更生。平心靜氣的說，到是各得其適，然而災禍的頻仍，糧價的暴漲，遂逼得省政府不能不改組，來應付這非常的局面。最初的傳說，是局部改組，秘書長劉旭輝氏將另有高就，但在劉氏榮任省府委員的明令發表不久，忽傳說全般改組，但始終也是傳說。迨吳主席出席二中全會回長，改組消息曾沈寂一時，但不久即正式揭露。</p>
<p>（一）插曲一段</p>
<p>正在政府明令改組以後，新任尙未到前，長沙又發生一樁離奇的事件，就是米價陡漲，在五天的期中，每石米由二萬八猛漲到五萬三，常時長沙大多數報紙幾乎是全體一致的說，有所謂「特殊勢人物」在長沙搜購穀米五萬石南運，當時衡陽祁陽零陵一帶的米價是七萬元，而且說廣東的米價每百斤是六萬元，湘米到粵，每石可淨賺五十斤米，這數字眞是相當的龐大，各報的社評，特寫，新聞，以至副刋，無不以此爲題，批評叙述，並謂此事係某要人之弟負責搜購，但迄未明言所謂「特殊勢力人物」究爲何人。官方的反應，僅是吳主席手令各有關機關調査所謂操縱居奇的人物來嚴辦，但是各機關照例照轉下去，一直沒有回聲。這一件閙到新主席上任的那一天，才烟銷雲散，沒人提起。這是新舊交替期間一段插曲。</p>
<p>（二）主湘得人</p>
<p>湖南人對新主席王東原最爲熟悉，王是皖人，但過去半生的事業幾乎全部建立在湖南，從當營長起一直到軍長，都在湖南，而且他的夫人也是湖南人。在他主湘命令傳到長沙，大家都說半個湖南人來主湘，總好些。他原隷屬於老四路總部，所以原來的袍澤舊部，都彈冠相慶，重溫昔日的舊夢。但時代是進步的，政治尤其是進步的。而王東原先生幾年來主持戰時訓練中心，一切都有極大的進步。</p>
<p>王氏四月二十六日到長，二十七日接印視事，他下車就說是「爲救災而來」。他對新聞界說，湘災比那省都重，臨湘岳陽都是他過去駐防之地，他說他這次經過臨岳時，簡直不能辨認，整個燬滅了。到湖南來頗有回家之感。這個家確是需要重新建立。他說到救災，他主張「發動大規模的工賑」，但沒有說出具體的辦法，他表示將與善後救濟分署接洽，爭取物資，來渡過難關，他並且說各項救濟，因爲種種關係來不及，所以他主張「自救互救」的政策，這政策過去河南曾實行過，生過效，就是由縣鄕保甲各層負責，那一甲有災民，那一甲負責救濟，那一保有災，那一保負責救濟，鄕由鄕負責，縣由縣負責。這樣可以迅速確實，比政府來救濟，還要好些。</p>
<p>（三）重點政治</p>
<p>讀到施政方針，王氏强調「重點政治」，他說他不作「百廢俱興」的奢望，但求做成一事是一事，點滴累積，以收實效。這一宣佈得到許多人的同情，但是事實上如何做法，只好靜候下文。</p>
<p>大家期望已久的雨，亦隨着王主席的專車而來，王主席剛下火車，就下雨，在封建思想還沒完全剷除的湖南社會，確引起人民莫大的興奮。可是連日的大雨不停，河水猛漲，山洪暴發，公路和鐵路已吿不通，而長沙沿河的街進，也在進水，要不會閙成水災才好，吾則糧荒正緊，又閙水災，湖南就更不得了。大雨以後，糧價略鬆，人民稍微喘一口氣</p>
<p>王主席宣布為救災而來，故定二日內偕社會處長劉修如日，救濟分署副署長姚雪懷，去湘南各災區勘災，但因公路鐵道被水所阻，還未成行，而胡佛氏來湘勘災，恐亦將因氣候關係而中止。</p>
<p>（四）一字之誤</p>
<p>最後，報吿一件湘省府改組聲中一點小揷曲：這次省府改組，原府委兼建廳長李毓堯免職，遺缺由原長沙市長李毓九繼任，不知是何原故，長沙。漢口。上海各報都把「九」字誤成「堯」字，於是各地都有函電向李毓曉氏致賀連任，直到王主席來長轉發府令，這事才弄淸楚，幾乎閙成一椿笑話，其實李毓九李毓堯各有其人，並非昆仲。</p>
<h3>垂頭喪氣·面如土色　晉奸逆遊街示眾</h3>
<p>— 太原六日通訊　忠寄</p>
<p>軍統局在山西地區逮捕之漢奸僞省畏蘇逆體仁等五十五名，除蘇逆體仁及前偽雁門道道尹江某（江淑海之孫）二名外，均以偵察終結，於昨日解交法院。</p>
<p>晟八時四十五分，由押解官孫逸賢，移送官胡金波等偕同警憲官員多人赴南肖牆臨時拘留所提解，其中陳欽善·張爾績。路雨亭·郭伊。周病。樊榮英·劉祥·常進九。買振海·因故均緩期另解外，其餘馮逆司直等四十七名，於加銬點名後，即分載於五輛載重汽車上，並各標以漢奸姓名條子，在戒備森嚴之情况下，同時起解。爲以巨奸示衆起見，汽車繞行幷垣鬧市，經紅市街，橋頭街，鐘樓街，按司街，帽兒巷等大街，車行甚緩，民眾聞訊，均以一覩往日為虎作　之巨奸眞面目爲快，故到處人山人海，有激於義憤者，不禁高呼肅淸漢奸，羣相附和，聲震雲霄。隨聲鼓掌者亦甚衆，各奸皆現窘狀，垂頭喪氣，面如土色者亦有之。抵達高等法院時，途上觀衆，不下數千，途爲之塞。由首席檢察官郝毓宗等，點名收案，九時四十分，開偵察庭，每批四名，十時即偵察完畢，當又押上汽車，送往省立第一監獄，由典獄長孟育才點收，核騐指紋無誤後分押，各奸皆獨佔一室，聽候正式開庭審訊。</p>
<p>三奸劣跡</p>
<p>四十七名漢奸中，以馮逆司直，主逆　，爲最重要。</p>
<p>（一）馮逆，山西平定人，少有才名，善逢迎，遇事則甚糊塗。事變前，曾歷任山西省敎育會長敎育廳廳長，國民師範學校校長。事變後，馮逆亦隨軍退晉南萬泉縣，居年餘返幷，向敵投効。</p>
<p>（二）王逆驤，山西壽陽縣人，因壯年辦理省立第一中學校有年，人才輩出，嗣辦理陽泉煤礦，成績頗佳。民國二十年蒙晉當局選薦爲建設廳長，一時頗負盛名，後又調任山西省銀行經理。太原陷敵後，屢遷至西安。廿八年該逆仍返陜西宜川縣秋林鎭第二戰區長官部暫任地，離去後轉香港料理避難之家務，於香港陷落後返并附敵。</p>
<p>（三）馬立伯，混跡新聞界多年性爽直，頗能文，以野馬為筆名。太原陷落之前夕，記者與遇於柳巷，以抗敵相勉，猶以「年高志不衰，看我老馬幹的吧」。自誇得志，曾在稷山組織民兵抗敵，曾幾何時，入城附敵，今日終成階下囚，為眾所笑！</p>
<h3>浣江一勺</h3>
<p>— 五日諸暨通訊　飛村</p>
<p>當我初到這山城的時候。諸曁的面貌是非常襤褸難看的。在戰爭中，它先後淪陷了三次，每一次敵人侵據了它，轟炸。燒殺。搗毀，每一次敵人在我們的人民武裝力量下退縮，又是轟炸·燒殺·搗毀；勝利來了，剛接收的當兒，只就城區的建築物來看，一百間房子已剩不了三四間，而且碩果僅有的一些，也還是沒有一間是完整的；在鄉間，那情形也非常凄慘，據說有整個村子被燬成一片白地的。—這些刧後的傷痕，正赤裸裸地顯示不了敵人侵略諸曁留下的紀念。住在這一個荒寂破敗的山城裏、只覺得戰爭的影子還是形影不離的追隨着我們。</p>
<p>諸曁人以「民性强悍」著稱，自然，在過去，他們曾以無數的血肉淚汗獻給了抗戰，那些爲解放本業而努力犧牲的故事，到如今還是民間所津津樂道的。在這裏，我不想介紹它們，只想面對着今日的諸曁作一種客觀的素描。</p>
<p>越女風塵</p>
<p>春天來後，這裏的民衆似乎也獲得了一分活力。由於屋荒，城鄉處處都在大典土木，建造新的房舍，但建起的房舍大都保持着「戰時式」的樣子，一切材料工程，比起戰前那種講究推敲的程度是不可同日而語了。廢墟已開始淸理，新屋子一天天在增加，兩個多月的時間，山城居然換了一件外衣似的，商舖子增加了，路面放寬了，現在，小小的城廂，也能聽到留聲機的歌聲，前兩天一家百貨商店在「抄盤」，雇了一班樂隊，吹吹打打，更添上了幾分繁閙。可是山城到底太荒凉了，那些樂聲，那些點綴，總使人不免有寂寞之感！</p>
<p>最閙熱的地點不在城中心區，却在北門頭一帶，那邊貼近火車站，汽車大多也在那邊停留，於是所謂商賈福輳，旅客雲集，造成了北門區今日的繁榮。好像這裏並沒有「公娼」的，私娼却活躍起來了。凡是合於那些車旅客商需要的一切物質亨受，它們都在慢慢地設備，添置起來。</p>
<p>據一些人估計，今後諸曁城區的繁榮，將有一段旺盛的時期，因爲目前浙贛路還沒有全綫接通。但我想：未來的諸曁在浙贛路上所佔的地位，由於它鄰近省垣（杭州），恐怕不會遜色於金蘭的吧？</p>
<p>淒厲圖畫</p>
<p>隨着春光來的，饑荒的黑影已罩上了這一片劫餘的土地。春訓開始，便整整落了三四十天的雨，一些農作物曾受到極大的摧殘，接着是疫病來了，大麥和小麥跟着發了瘟病，今年上期恐怕不會有怎樣好的收成。今年是戰後第一個年頭，民以食爲天，食糧首先威脅着人們，最近米價一跳就跳出三萬大關，比滬杭一帶大有迎頭趕上之勢。</p>
<p>民間大多是窮得快要連聞聞「飯香」的權利都沒有了，雖然救濟麵粉曾發過一次，可是五市斤中什麽用哪，救一活的窮命，一想到「明日」就不禁渾身發抖！何况攤派式的「款」「米」，還是在嚴厲執行着！</p>
<p>在糧荒中，小學敎師首當其衝的觸到了危機，有好幾個鄕的「中心國民學校」和「保國民學校」業已無米爲炊，敎師總不能束緊了褲帶挨餓上課哪！於是，有了怠敎了，有的索性閉門大吉。最近元東鄕鄕校的學生舉行請願遊行，他們小小的口號便是：「我們要讀書！我們不能讓老師挨餓！」</p>
<p>正如其他地方一樣，看來這裏將要展開一幅令人不忍卒睹的凄慘畫面了！</p>
<h3>東京變得小了　人口減少，祗有三百五十萬　只要有錢，什麽都可買得到</h3>
<p>— 本報編譯室特譯</p>
<p>今日的東京，無疑地是全世界最小的一個都市。住在東京記者俱樂部裏的新聞記者，經歷一戰爭碩果僅存的歐美僑民，甚至佔領軍中的官兵，對此三百五十萬人口的都市的日常生活，並不發生任何直接的關切。出入於社交場中的祇有二三千人，他們遲早會互相認識的。</p>
<p>固然也有人注意到日本的政治和經濟的動向，而加以認眞的觀察和分析，而且每一個外僑都和操英語或法語的日本人發生多少的接觸，可是日本人的生活方式，和各種問題，在西方人看來，具有一種顯然不同缺乏現實性的色彩。對於西方人發生影響的最重大的一件事，恐怕要算是銀行存款的凍結和老日圓的改爲新臼圓了。這也是他們所擔心的一件事。</p>
<p>位於東京核心的「丸之內」旅館，是歐美人和日本人的社交中心場所。這一所公寓並沒有被美軍接收下來作為營房之用，它變成了歐洲公使館人員（過去和現在的），以及美國官兵的寄宿舍。此外，日本外交部人員也得到許可在二樓和三樓闢室居住下來。在整個冬季裏，從鷄尾酒時刻（實際上並沒有鷄尾酒）一直到半夜以後，那旅館的休息室裏聚集着賓客和來訪者，討論着各種計劃。</p>
<p>外交人員即使在他們的政府已經不復存在的時候，也還有維持其外交地位的意興。這話對於義大利人是特別適用的，他們靠了自己的幸遝和日本人不可思義的頭腦，在一九四四年義大利的巴陀根里奧政府投降以後，被拘禁在那裏，等待回國的法國人，歧視着義大利人，在戰時負有代管各國僑民事務的瑞典人和瑞士人，則歧視着法國人和義大利人，但是美國人採取他們傳統的非政治的態度，對於誰　不加歧視。</p>
<p>日本外交部人員照樣聚居在那寄宿舍裏，他們從語言方面分成兩派—一派是操英語的，另一派是操法語的。要知道一個日本人是屬於那一派，不必聽了他的說話纔能知通，只須觀察一下便可確定。操英語的日本人是粗魯的，誠懇過度的，發出又高又長的笑聲，表示他們怎樣懂得笑話的意義。操法語的日本人，常把上裝披在肩頭，像歌劇裏面的披肩，蓄着長長的頭髮。</p>
<p>這些事都已成陳迹，因爲僑居日本的外交人員大部分都已回國了。但是在他們回國以前，曾經發生過幾椿社交界大事，値得在這裏重提一下：一件是前法國駐日總領事的「令媛」茄羅華女士下嫁美國陸軍攝影師華納先生；另一件事是前義大利大使和印苔麗夫人宴請威羅培少將，正在宴飲之際，突有美憲兵率領的黑市搜捕隊闖入，打斷了興高采烈的盛會，結果美軍數人和義次利前空軍，人員二人被捕而去。</p>
<p>三月初參加戰犯審判的蘇聯代表三十人到達東京，接着「丸之內」旅館裏面的國際色彩加上了一層紅的光彩。雖然事前流傳着旅館內將發生流血的謠言，可是全體紅軍人員和那旅館裏面的白俄人安然相處，並沒有發生意外。</p>
<p>東京的黑市是日本人和西洋人中間的主要束縛之一，在日本投降以後六個多月，一包美國香烟依然不失為物價的標準，和佔領軍不發生關係的歐洲人差不多完全購買超過官價的物品。</p>
<p>正如在遠東居留過二十七年的某法國人所說的：「謝謝上帝，日本已變成一個澈底解體的國家，只要你付得出錢，什麽東西你都可以買得到」。（合衆社東京特派員卡里休十二日電。）</p>
<h3>科學點滴</h3>
<p>美國科學家現在正在　國硏究樹木底產物。如織維素，木糖，酒精。食物酵素，以及其他在饑時供納粹作戰的物質。</p>
<p>據　告印度有大量鉛　蘊藏。</p>
<p>二千年以前雲南已發現錫礦，但直到西歷一千年還沒有開始營業性的礦業。</p>
<p>一九四五年　羅的大米收成甚豐，暹羅政府宣佈每月將有三萬噸免費交聯合國作爲今年供給缺乏大米的國家食用。</p>
<p>美國在戰時曾用了二百萬噸鋼的合金製造飛機械和機身。</p>

<h3>牀上的畫</h3>
<p>— 胡士弱</p>
<p>居在上海的人想去領略山水的蒼翠是極不容易的，尤其是大多數的小職員和以薪金收入的生活担負者。在這一大多數中間還有着我，當然無庸說是想遊山玩水撫松尋壑，即或知道了公園裏已靑了草木，偶偸千忙一暇想去逛遊一下，還是被內心打破；於是只有爬上鴿子籠似的牀上閉上眼讓那靑山綠水翠柏蒼松從黑暗和窒悶裏來想像。</p>
<p>可是這是不能滿足的，人類的慾望原也如此，反不如畫餅充風；於是利用了一個晚上趕成了一張圖貼在牀上</p>
<p>因爲宿舍裏僅有的一扇小窗，開在廚房的後面，正和廚房裏的窗子相對，所以這扇窗我們很不願去啓開它，寗願讓炎夏的沈悶充溢着，吾則煤臭煤灰和熱度比閉上窗所受的熱悶更難熬。我在這裏住下了五年，什麼都慣常了，祇是有時續到描寫田野山鄕的文章不禁常憶起家鄕，躍躍地欲去遨遊原野，然而這力量到底比生活的鞭子輕小得多哩！</p>
<p>那張圖我便是用我的回憶繪成鄕下的居室窗外的景色。在故鄕山巒繞回的老屋裘，我擇了一間面東南開着敞窗的樓房當書室，那面東南的窗外是一叢和窗子差不多高的柳樹，除了夏季有白絮飄滿書案外我還是非常珍愛它的，柳樹外是一條溪，祇是窄了些，除在夏秋之交的淫雨後的漲水外，終年十之六七是乾早着的，可是我並不希罕這些，因爲在離這谿更遠便是盈盈的一湖碧水，像先前我更可以望得到湖水漪漣的浮動，和傍湖人家早暮的動作。這湖面積很小，湖的南面是蜿蜒的一連山；溪是不和湖水述通的，祇有山水的冲激可以流入溪內。我尤其感到可愛的是炎夏雨後的碧翠欲溜一片美景，積留在柳葉上的水滴被陽光照得閃薪光來，靑黃的田野經濯洗後更爲淸麗了。因爲老是深印着這景色在腦中，我便把它繪在白色的紙片上。這不是想點綴牀的美觀——在我這牀上和這斗大的宿舍裏是終年帶着塵絲，八張牀上和僅能留一條走路的地方已零亂得不可收拾了的</p>
<p>到晚間放下一日間工作疲乏的身體，便藉它來舒舒心身，如果炎熱得喘不過氣時，我也常望一望，誠如我打開了窗子望見了盛暑雨後的凉爽，也似一股淸鮮的風掠進窗來。</p>
<p>這時期薪水階級中人誰也在茫然紊糊中生活着，誰願去望一望更遠的呢？畫餅充饑已够給我們一點安慰了。</p>
<p>如今春悄悄地降蒞大地，春在江南是多麼的嫵媚明麗呀！我又像望見了故鄕山色由黃枯而變成蕉綠了。今天下着春雨的天，茁芽的枝頭又嫩綠了。</p>
<h3>復活</h3>
<p>— 登臨</p>
<p>希望似一枝花朶，元會凋謝了，但也會復活。生命似一顆小草，元會無聲息的枯黃，但也會蓬勃的生長。</p>
<p>朋友！常你看到了美麗的黃昏而起了惆悵時，你也有吾想到了明天，明天它又會毫不慳吝的顯現在你的眼前。留下你可珍惜的淚吧！生命是永不止息的。</p>
<p>那一天的淸晨，我問了華—一個年靑的朋友：「你覺到些什麽？這時代！」</p>
<p>「我有些乏味兒，周圍太冷酷了！」</p>
<p>「爲什麽呢？你道要把自己縈繞些煩惱？」</p>
<p>「呵！我說不出。我空虛得抓不到什麽，可是又像鬱塞了什麽！」</p>
<p>年靑人就愛唱這一套老調，常他的心靈有了一些兒虧損的時候。</p>
<p>於是，在一張空白的紙上我給他寫下了這樣的話：「梅花郤曾從從厚雪中伸出了　子來迎候新春的，雖然周圍也是同樣的冷酷。」</p>
<p>吿訴給我周圍的朋友：當水國裏掠過了春風的時候，一切都還會復活的，所以不必爲你的希望的幻滅而起了悲哀。記經：這是句永不變更的話，生命是永不止息的。</p>
<p>願把它鐫在每個人的心際。</p>
<h3>最大的安慰</h3>
<p>— 中原</p>
<p>許多吃素老太太、手裏時時刻刻撥動着唸佛珠，口裏一歇不停地「阿彌陀佛阿彌陀佛」，據說是爲自己積財，不過那財並非積在地上，乃是積在西天佛國裏，據說唸一遍佛，就在佛國裏存下一筆錢、所以大家拚命地唸着，希望將來死了升上西天，能寫寫意意享福一輩子。</p>
<p>這是吃素老太太們的想法，當然不好算數，若是佛敎徒唸佛的目的僅是想上西天後享福，則佛教就成了一種自私的宗敎了，不過在基督敎中，倒確有「積財於大」的敎訓，但其所謂的「財」，是指點「愛」，叫人愛朋友，愛隣舍，愛普世界所有的人，其至愛仇敵——「愛」是一份積在天國裏永不朽壞的財產！</p>
<p>撇開宗敎不談，當此亂世。即使用世俗的利害觀念來看，「積財於天」，也實在不是一件吃虧的事，今天你在地上搜括了萬菓家財，却日夜提心吊胆地防賊子，防强盜，防人敲詐，甚至要防殺身之禍，有什麽幸福可言呢？然而，假使你把你的愛施予人，有時候只需一聲安慰，一個微笑，就能換得人們永恒的感激和永恒的愛！</p>
<p>世界上有什麽快樂比了人人愛你，人人感激你更快樂呢？</p>
<p>尋找幸福的男男女女，還是放下累贅的金子銀子，快快積財於天吧！</p>

<h3>防空洞裏的愛情</h3>
<p>— 任鈞</p>
<p>他倆是在防空洞裏認識的——</p>
<p>當初夏的炎陽開始照臨大地的時候，</p>
<p>當山城的霧幕給熱風拉開的時候，</p>
<p>常大批大批的敵機經常來訪的時候。</p>
<p>敵彈使得無數的家人父子</p>
<p>都不能不暫時分離，</p>
<p>（多少人已經被疏散到四鄉！）</p>
<p>但也使得許多人由陌生變成相識，</p>
<p>由相識變成知已。</p>
<p>他倆，不久——</p>
<p>也便由相識變成相愛。</p>
<p>愛情眞有點近於自私，</p>
<p>愛情也會使人變成特別大阻：</p>
<p>在最初的時候，</p>
<p>他倆甚至希望能够多發幾次警報；</p>
<p>因爲這麽一來——</p>
<p>彼此便能够多見次幾面，</p>
<p>多談幾次話，</p>
<p>多緊緊地挨着坐幾回，</p>
<p>多共幾次患難呵！</p>
<p>不久——</p>
<p>像冒着風雪開放的梅花，</p>
<p>他倆的愛情，便在苦難中：</p>
<p>由含苞而怒放了！</p>
<p>幷且，在一個晴朗的秋日裏，</p>
<p>在一次「惡性轟炸」後，</p>
<p>他倆終於由防空洞裏跑了出來，</p>
<p>舉行那簡單而莊嚴的結婚儀式。</p>
<p>恐怕敵人也完全沒有想到過吧？——</p>
<p>他們的屠殺和破壞的炸彈，竟變成了</p>
<p>有情人終成眷屬的媒妁！</p>
<h3>雙宿雙飛（三五）</h3>
<p>— 趙清閣</p>
<p>「哥哥，你也去北京吧！媽說，北京有很多很多的書買給我們念。』麗華終於耐不住地這樣勸寳鈴了。同時，她也確爲這些個「書」的憧憬所誘惑。</p>
<p>寳鈴沒言語，只搖搖頭，用手親切地撫換着麗華的頭髮。</p>
<p>麗華愈發不解了，她心裹想想寳鈴平日不是也最愛念書的嗎？爲什麽如今連書都引誘不了他呢？</p>
<p>就這樣，　華在幼稚的迷茫中，被墨太太帶進了一個新命運的逆流裏！</p>
<p>當大家快分手的時候，寳鈴啞聲地向墨太太說：</p>
<p>『媽！您放心走吧！我已抓找到事了！我會很掙氣地活着！』說罷，寳鈴還勉强地苦笑了一下。</p>
<p>『好的。可是，我也已經爲你安排好了，將來墨盛會照應你的。」</p>
<p>墨太太哭了！但是，她終於一狠心，毅然牽着麗華和麗雲走了！</p>
<p>麗華紅着眼睛不斷地回頭看寳鈴；看那座她生長了八年的房子；看她所熟諗的一草一木……</p>
<p>唯有麗雲是坦然的；快活的；因爲她就要再見到她的母親了。而且，她對於他們所感受的那些問題，都沒有什麼印象。她覺得換一個新的環境很好，同時在他純真的心裏，只要有麗華同她一道，她就滿足了。</p>
<p>寶鈴送罷墨太太和麗華以後，再回到這所空屋，他的心也空了！他走進書房坐到墨老爺生前常坐的太師椅上，一陣劇烈的刺痛，像萬把利刃穿進他的胸膛，他無可奈何地伏在案頭上，失聲嚎啕了！</p>
<p>「爸爸！」</p>
<p>墨盛目睹這齣在他看來，該是已閉幕的墨家悲劇！他嘆了口氣，扶起寳鈴，安慰地說：</p>
<p>「老爺子沒白疼您，有您留在荆州，他老人家九泉之下，也可以含笑瞑目了！」</p>
<p>寳鈴聽見這話，沉慟地仰起顯來，淚眼模糊地凝視着墨盛。宛如發現了墨老爺的靈魂，他眩惑地撲過去，暈倒在墨盛的懷裏了！</p>

<h3>Zheng Jiemin Suddenly Flies to Nanjing for Instructions; Situation in North China Extremely Tense</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 14th] Military Mediation Department committee member Zheng Jiemin suddenly left Beiping and flew to Nanjing this afternoon. It is generally speculated that Zheng's trip symbolizes the extremely tense situation in North China. The Military Mediation Department is facing major difficulties, and Zheng urgently needs to report or seek instructions from the central government. The current situation in North China can be summarized in a few words: frequent military deployments, sporadic conflicts occurring everywhere, and continuous destruction of transportation. The deterioration of the situation is unprecedented since the armistice agreement. However, to say that the Communist army is attempting to encircle Tianjin and Beiping seems to be an overstatement. This afternoon, a certain government military leader told reporters that the Communist side in North China is carrying out large-scale deployments, reinforcing the Northeast, and destroying transportation to prevent the National Army from reinforcing the Northeast. On the other hand, they fear that the remaining forces in North China are weak, so they are adopting an offensive-defensive strategy, launching attacks everywhere. However, these continuous small-scale conflicts are the breeding ground for large-scale war. The situation in North China is also very noteworthy. The conflict in the northern section of the Jinpu Railway is currently the focus of attention here. National Army troops have already arrived in the Fengjiakou area, and fierce fighting is currently underway. Baotou is still occupied by the Communist army. In the vicinity of Pingbei (northern Beiping) in the areas of Huairou, Zunhua, and Miyun, the Communist army under Li Yunpin is gathering in large numbers, and the situation is also extremely tense.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 14th] The government side of the Military Mediation Department has lodged a serious protest against the Communist army's occupation of Fengjiakou and Baotou, demanding that the Communist army leaders who occupied these two places be punished and immediately withdraw, arguing that the Communist side should be held responsible for violating the ceasefire order. The Communist side claimed that this was due to the Communist army in that area being attacked by the National Army. Later, the American representative of the Baotou group proposed that neither side station troops in these two areas. The government side believes that if this is resolved in this way, there is no guarantee that similar incidents will not occur again in the future, so they insist on their original protest. This has not yet been resolved. Therefore, there is a proposal for the Military Mediation Department to send another group to investigate. As for rumors that Mi Luohan, the government representative of the Baotou group, was killed, the government side denies it.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 14th] The Beining Railway, a major supply route for the Northeast National Army, is currently being subjected to continuous and planned destruction by the Communist army. This morning, the Qian'suo and Gaoling stations on the section of the Beining Railway outside the Shanhaiguan Pass were suddenly surrounded by more than 10,000 Communist troops, and fierce fighting is underway. Bridge No. 156 in Xiao'ancun was destroyed at 1:30 PM this afternoon, and Bridge No. 157 was destroyed at 3:30 PM this afternoon. The railway tracks two kilometers east of Wangjiacun between Qian'suo and Gaoling were also destroyed. Xiaosonglinggou near Gaoling was occupied by more than 10,000 Communist troops last night at 9 PM. The telephone line between Tangshan and Shanhaiguan on the section within the Shanhaiguan Pass was destroyed at 11 PM last night and has not been restored as of this afternoon.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 14th] News about the Battle of Sipingjie is conflicting. The local *World Daily* and *Dajin Yishi Daily* today carried urgent telegrams stating that after seven days of fighting, the area has been completely captured by the National Army. However, a Xinhua News Agency telegram from the 10th stated that the fighting in the city had reached a stalemate after nine days of artillery bombardment by the National Army. It also stated that Zheng Dongguo is currently directing operations at Shuangmiaozi, south of Sipingjie.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 15th] Official intelligence states that the Communist army has recently made plans to reorganize the command of its troops in various regions. The division of responsibilities in the Shanxi area is as follows: (1) The area west of the Pinghan Railway between Shijiazhuang and Zhangde, east of the Baijin Railway, and south of the Zhengtai Railway is under the command of Liu Bocheng, with Li Da as his deputy. (2) The Taiyue area and the area east of the southern section of the Tongpu Railway are under the command of Chen Geng, with Han Jun and Sun Dingguo as his deputies. (3) The northern section of the Pinghan Railway, the area north of the Zhengtai Railway, and the area east of the northern section of the Tongpu Railway are under the command of Nie Rongzhen, with Chen Zhengxiang as his deputy. (4) The Jin-Sui and Shaan-Gan-Ning border region is under the command of He Long, with Zhang Youxun and Xiao Jingguang as his deputies.</p>

<h3>Wu Guozhen Speaks in Nanjing: Sympathizes with the Shanghai Citizens Who Have Suffered Eight Years of Hardship; Governance Is Not About Many Words, But About Doing More Things</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 14th] After the last press conference held this afternoon, the newly appointed Mayor of Shanghai, Wu Guozhen, was surrounded by more than seventy reporters from Nanjing and Shanghai newspapers in the Carp Hall of the Longmen Restaurant. They requested him to announce his administrative policy. Wu replied to the reporters in a very sincere tone, saying that he still knew nothing about the current situation in Shanghai. This was not a modest statement, but a reflection of the actual situation.</p>
<h3>Minister of Economy and Finance Will Likely Change; The Central Standing Committee and National Defense Council Will Decide Today</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 14th] Wu Guozhen's transfer to the position of Mayor of Shanghai will leave a vacancy in the position of Minister of the Central Propaganda Department, which will be decided by the Central Standing Committee to be held at the National Government Office on the morning of the 15th.

It is said that the successor for the position of Minister of Economic Affairs will also be discussed and decided by the Central Standing Committee and the Supreme National Defense Council.

<h3>Qian Dajun Urges Wu Guozhen to Come Soon; Various Bureaus and Departments of the Municipal Government Are Rushing to Hand Over; Li Jilan, Commander-in-Chief of the Songhu Garrison, Also Resigns</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Wu Guozhen's appointment as the new Mayor of Shanghai was approved by the routine meeting of the Executive Yuan yesterday morning. It is rumored that Wu may come to Shanghai to take office on the 20th of this month, and all sectors of the city will express a warm welcome. Yesterday, Mayor Qian specially sent a telegram urging him to come soon. The original telegram reads: "Nanjing Propaganda Minister Wu Guozhen Brother Xun Jian, Secret, Reading the newspaper that the Central Government appointed you as Mayor of Shanghai, what a welcome! I hope you will come soon, so that I can immediately hand over. Sincerely telegram congratulations, and express my sincere feelings. Brother Qian Dajun Chen Han." He also telegraphed President Song of the Executive Yuan, requesting to resign from the position of Chairman of the Housing Allocation Committee for Shanghai Agencies of the Executive Yuan. The original text is as follows: "Nanjing Executive Yuan President Song Jun Jian; I sincerely resign from the position of Mayor of Shanghai. I am sure you will approve. All members of the Housing Allocation Committee for Shanghai Agencies of the Executive Yuan are requested to quickly assign personnel to take over. Before the assignment, Deputy Director Peng will be responsible for presiding. I respectfully ask you to consider this. Your humble servant Qian Dajun Chen Han."</p>
<p>According to our reporter, Mayor Qian may be appointed as the Chief Aide-de-Camp of the National Government. All sectors of society greatly admire Mayor Qian's efforts in reorganizing this large city in a difficult and complex environment. Now that he is leaving, they also feel reluctant.</p>
<p>In addition, the resignations of the Municipal Government Secretary-General Shen Shihua, Director of the Finance Bureau Pu Zhengdong, Director of the Health Bureau Yu Songjun, and Director of the Land Administration Bureau Chen Shiquan have all been approved. After being approved by the central government, Deputy Mayor He De'an was appointed as Secretary-General, Gu Chunfan, the current Deputy Director of the Postal Administration, was appointed as Director of the Finance Bureau. Mr. Gu is an expert in finance and economics and has represented China at the World Monetary Conference. Zhu Ping, the former Director of the Land Bureau of Jiangsu Province, was appointed as Director of the Land Administration Bureau. Mr. Zhu has outstanding research on land issues and has served as a professor in the Land Administration Department of the Central Political School and other positions. The newly appointed Director of the Health Bureau, Li Ting'an, is a public health expert and served as Director of the Shanghai Health Bureau in 1937. It is reported that Wu Kaixian, Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, Zhao Zukang, Director of the Public Works Bureau, and Zhao Zengjue, Director of the Public Utilities Bureau, will not be changed. Currently, all bureaus and departments of the Municipal Government have received orders from the Mayor to rush to handle the handover matters. The handover method is that the various departments and themselves should prepare a detailed list of assets, number of personnel, and all files, and send them to the Secretariat for collection. The bureaus that have been ordered to be transferred should directly hand over to the respective successors without going through the Municipal Government. The bureaus and departments that have not been changed should also go through the clearing procedures, which is the so-called "fake handover." All members of the Municipal Government have been busy recently organizing the handover work, hoping to complete it within two or three days. Zhu Xubai, Director of the News Department, also submitted his resignation to the Mayor yesterday. Changes in the department will be approved directly by the Central Propaganda Department.</p>
<p>It is reliably learned that Li Jilan, Commander-in-Chief of the Songhu Garrison Headquarters, is also resigning from his post. Because Shanghai is the only metropolis in the country, the environment is special, and personnel are complicated. It is necessary to have a firm grasp and clear understanding before any recommendations can be made. After finishing his speech, he clasped his hands and thanked the reporters, smiling and saluting as he walked out of the meeting hall. The reporters still followed him closely, and only dispersed after seeing Mr. Wu off in a car. According to the newly appointed Mayor of Shanghai, Wu Guozhen, who told this newspaper's reporter, he will go to Shanghai to take office after completing the handover, which should not take more than a week. The three newly appointed Directors of the Shanghai Finance, Land Administration, and Health Bureaus will also take office at the same time. He believes that there are many things to be done in Shanghai, but after more than half a year of continuous planning by Mayor Qian, there is already a track to follow. He believes that the Mayor is a public servant of the people, and after taking office, he must work for the master with sincerity and integrity, and work hard for the country with loyalty and honesty. He solemnly instructed the reporter of this newspaper, wishing to use a corner of this newspaper to convey to the elders of Shanghai that Wu Guozhen worked tirelessly as Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs and Minister of Propaganda for the country. Wu Guozhen has been appointed as the Mayor of Shanghai to sympathize with the millions of citizens who have suffered more than eight years of deception and oppression. "Governance is not about many words," but about doing more things. Finally, Wu also instructed and instructed that his father-in-law was Huang Puguan, and his wife's name was Huang Zhuoqun. There was an error in yesterday's newspaper, which shows that he is careful and realistic.</p>
<h3>Traitor Deng Zuyu Publicly Tried in Nanjing; Traitor Lin Bosheng Scheduled to Be Tried on the 25th</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 14th] The Capital High Court publicly tried Deng Zuyu, who once held important puppet positions such as puppet governor of Jiangxi Province and puppet chief of the Capital Police Department, at 2:00 PM today. The presiding judge was Presiding Judge Ge Zhitong, with judges Wang Hongquan and Tian Heming, prosecutor Wang Jiaojun, and clerk Xu Yizhen. Traitor Deng wore a dark blue striped long robe and black leather shoes, with a fat head and big ears. When he was taken from the waiting room to the courtroom, the audience was packed. Traitor Deng, awed by the dignity of the court and thousands of burning eyes, bowed his head and cowered. After standing in the defendant's column, the muscles on his face trembled, unable to overcome his fear. Deng is from Jiangxi, 56 years old, and lives at No. 21 Shixiang Lane, Zhongzheng Road, Nanjing. It is said that after the outbreak of the Anti-Japanese War, he took his family to seek refuge, and all his property was lost. On December 26, 1937, he returned to Shanghai from Taizhou Rugao, extremely embarrassed. Then, in February 1938, he was introduced by Chen Renhe (i.e., Chen Qun) to participate in the Maintenance Association. In October of the same year, he served as the Education Director of the Puppet Police School, and later as the Puppet Governor of Jiangxi Province and the Puppet Chief of the Capital Police Department, but he resigned after only six months. Traitor Deng also claimed that he had done counter-espionage work, and during his tenure as the puppet director, he released patriotic people and submitted documents. Finally, when asked about his family, Deng replied that he had more than 20 people, including one wife, two concubines, three sons, and four daughters. Because the case is complex and requires further collection of witness testimony and special testimony, there was no debate. At 3:30 PM, the court ordered a postponement for a retrial, and Traitor Deng was taken back into custody.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 14th] It was recently learned from the Capital High Court that the puppet Propaganda Minister Lin Bosheng will be tried on the morning of the 25th of this month. It is said that a recording will be played to assist in the trial, similar to the trial of traitor Chen Gongbo. The recording will be provided by Pan Qiyuan of the Central Broadcasting Station. According to Mr. Pan, he has collected three records, which are Lin's speeches during his visit to Japan, and are currently being sorted out.</p>

<p>[Reuters, London, 14th] The "Times" editorial today called for a peaceful solution to the Northeast China problem, stating in brief: The Northeast is rich in resources, and China's revitalization plan depends on it. The government cannot allow it to fall entirely into the hands of the Communists. Unless they want to turn the Northeast into a long-term battlefield of civil war, the Kuomintang and the Communist Party should order a cessation of conflict. Agricultural reform programs now occupy an important position in the Chinese government's plan, and the Communist Party should use its position as an important political party to effectively use constitutional behavior. If they resort to force, they will both lose. Both the Kuomintang and the Communist Party now attach importance to the national revitalization plan, and if the internal situation is chaotic, it will be greatly hindered.</p>

Even the road between Guangzhou and Qujiang is impassable. A UNRRA truck was robbed by bandits halfway on the Guangzhou-Qujiang road.

<h3>Zhu Shiming Meets with Pauley Again to Discuss Japan's Reparations to China; The United Nations Agrees to Use Wartime Industries as Reparations</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 14th] Lieutenant General Zhu Shiming, head of the Chinese delegation to Japan, met with Pauley, the US reparations representative, again this morning with experts and others to discuss Japan's reparations to China. Zhu had previously spoken to Pauley once yesterday afternoon.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 13th] The United Nations has agreed to use most of Japan's wartime industries as reparations for the countries concerned. Representatives of the eleven nations of the United Nations Far East Commission unanimously decided today to use a large portion of Japan's army and navy arsenals, aircraft, and light metal industries as "temporary" reparations, with some manufactured goods being exempted. The Committee has now decided to leave out considerable rotating and towing equipment in the light metal industry to maintain the production of 25,000 tons of aluminum metal per year. Ten industrial companies and three companies, Mitsui, Sumitomo, Kuhara, Taihei, Yasuda, ---, and Nakajima, which had fostered Japanese aggression, will be confiscated as reparations. McConnell, the US representative and chairman of the committee, said: The committee's detailed agreement on Japan's final reparations policy is difficult to decide for the time being. According to McConnell and other representatives of the committee, the three types of reparations items opened today are clearly those that the United Nations will not allow Japan to retain. The final disposition of other industries can only be decided after the United Nations agrees on which industries Japan is allowed to retain. Today's decision is based on the various suggestions originally put forward by Pauley, the US reparations expert, to President Truman.</p>

<h3>Yellow River Project Obstructed; Communist Army Insists on Allowing Temporary Closure of the Breach; Both Sides Send Representatives to Beijing to Continue Negotiations</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Kaifeng, 13th] The Yellow River closure and embankment restoration project is on the verge of being abandoned halfway due to the repeated insistence of the Communist army representatives on the request to "only allow the restoration of the embankment and temporarily suspend the closure of the breach." If it fails completely, the countless hundreds of millions of funds spent by the central government, the heavy burden borne by the people of Henan Province, and the human and material assistance of international friends will all be wasted, causing even deeper suffering to the vast people suffering from the Yellow River disaster. The negotiations between the Yellow River Commission and the Communist Party representatives have clearly failed to achieve a satisfactory new record. The commission believes that this is related to the stability and security of half of the country and must seek a thorough solution. Therefore, it sent consultants and senior staff Chen Shuzeng and Zhang Jichun, accompanied by Communist army representatives Zhao Mingfu and Wang Xiaoyi, to Beijing by car on the morning of the 12th to continue negotiations and request the central government to make a final decision. However, the closure work at Huayuankou is still continuing and has not been suspended.</p>

<p>Crackdown on Merchants Deceiving Travelers</p>
<p>Recently in Hangzhou, some unscrupulous motor vehicle merchants have been exploiting the difficulties in road transportation and the lack of vehicles.

<p>The Railway Bureau Decides to Repair the Ningbo-Cao'e Section of the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway First: The Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway has historically only consisted of the section from Hangzhou to Shanghai and the section from Ningbo to the Cao'e River. The segment from the Qiantang River to the Cao'e River has never been connected. In 1936, the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Bureau constructed a railway track to realize the connection from Shanghai to Ningbo, which was completed in the autumn of 1937. Subsequently, after Hangzhou was occupied by the enemy forces, the section from Xixing to the Cao'e River was ordered to be destroyed first. During the Ningbo "914 Incident," the Cao'e River to Ningbo section was also ordered to be destroyed. To date, it has not been repaired. Currently, the Railway Bureau, considering that the full restoration of the railway is difficult, has decided to repair the Ningbo-Cao'e section first, with work commencing on June 1st.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Recognizing the Crux of the Political Impasse</h3>
<p>With Special Envoy Marshall returning to Nanjing along with the National Government, and starting meetings with the municipal government the day before yesterday, followed by discussions with Zhou Enlai, the representative of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), the atmosphere in the capital has turned optimistic regarding the overall situation in China. It is generally believed that once the representatives of the various parties arrive in Nanjing, the comprehensive group meeting of the Political Consultative Council (PCC) can be reopened. This is, of course, an encouraging sign, but given that the CCP is still insisting on a ceasefire in the Northeast as a condition for reopening negotiations, and is simultaneously launching offensives everywhere in North China and along the lines, it seems that we cannot be too optimistic just yet.</p>
<p>I recall that when the PCC opened in Chongqing in January, it was precisely when the nationwide conflicts were declared to have ceased, allowing for consultations to proceed in a peaceful atmosphere. After more than twenty days of discussions, five agreements were reached with the unanimous support of various parties, factions, and social elites. The main principles of the agreements were: (1) The nationalization of the military, implementing a basic plan for the reorganization and integration of troops, including the incorporation of CCP forces into the National Army, to ensure domestic peace; (2) The democratization of politics, starting with the formation of a national government inclusive of individuals from various parties and factions, followed by the convening of a National Assembly on May 5th to enact a constitution and embark on the path of democratic politics. However, in the three months since the PCC closed, not only have the agreements it passed not seen concrete implementation, but the two major principles of military nationalization and political democracy, which were unanimously hoped for by the entire nation, seem to have been completely forgotten by one or two parties. Moreover, the political situation has deteriorated, with the CCP attempting to expand its territory everywhere, without end or limit. For example, regarding the Northeast issue, after the Soviet army withdrew, the central government's troops went to take over, which was perfectly legitimate and there should be no objections. Unexpectedly, a so-called "Democratic Allied Army" appeared in the Northeast, and the so-called "Battle of Changchun and Harbin" occurred, plunging the uncontroversial takeover of the Northeast into a stalemate. Similarly, in the northern section of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway and the Subei region, CCP troops are constantly encroaching, causing the local people to suffer terribly, with no avenue for redress. In the political sphere, the CCP has rigid opinions regarding the constitutional draft. Regarding the National Assembly and the reorganization of the national government, it first argued over the number of representatives and members of the national government, and later simply refused to provide a list, citing the Northeast issue as an excuse. As a result, the National Assembly, which was supposed to convene on May 5th, had to be postponed again, and the reorganization of the government could not be started.</p>
<p>If this political impasse is not quickly remedied, it is likely to lead to an unprecedented crisis in the long run. People who care about the times and love the country should be vigilant, face reality, and not just engage in empty talk, remain aloof, and be indifferent to right and wrong. We believe that the people who are third parties should not continue to be confused, but must first recognize where the crux of the current political impasse lies. By understanding this, a correct remedy can be prescribed, forcing those who violate the will of the people to fulfill their promises.</p>
<p>The greatest achievement of the PCC was undoubtedly the formulation of a basic plan for the reorganization and integration of the military, because a unified military and command are absolutely necessary to put the country's politics on the right track. And the fundamental crux of the former political impasse lies in the fact that this plan has not been thoroughly implemented. The plan originally stipulated that it would be implemented in stages over eighteen months, with the aim of reducing military spending, promoting national economic construction, and establishing an army sufficient to defend the country. At the end of twelve months, the national army should consist of one hundred and eight divisions, of which eighteen divisions would be formed by CCP troops and ninety divisions would be formed by government troops; and within six months after the twelve-month period, the government army should be further reduced to fifty divisions, and the CCP army should be further reduced to ten divisions. At the same time, a military mediation executive department was to be organized by government representative Zheng Jiemin, CCP representative Ye Jianying, and American representative Robinson, to go to various military standoff locations in the north to inspect and realize peace and restore transportation. According to this, all parts of the country, whether it is the Northeast, North China, Central China, or South China, should maintain the state of affairs when the ceasefire order took effect on January 13th this year, and no movement should be allowed. But everyone knows that the situation in various places now is very different from what it was at that time. Zhou Enlai even said: "Since the signing of this agreement, the situation in the Northeast has changed." In his opinion, the plan for the reorganization and integration of the military is no longer applicable to the Northeast. A plan negotiated and established by all parties and factions in the country can actually be unilaterally abandoned by the CCP, and torn up by force. So why bother with hypocritical negotiations? Therefore, the main reason for the current political impasse is that the agreement of the PCC has become merely a statement of intent, without any binding force. In other words, the solemn PCC lacks a strong institution to enforce the agreements. Although there is a military mediation executive department, with the participation of American representatives, to inspect various places, it is only inspection. There is a lack of a coercive force. There is no talk of mediation, let alone execution. For example, the executive group has been to North China, Central China, the Northeast, and the Subei region, but how many tasks have been carried out? And why not frankly announce to the Chinese people the truth about which side violated the order and which side obeyed it? Even a fair announcement is not dared to be made. Is there still the power to mediate? Is there still the power to implement punishment? The most bizarre thing is that when the executive group arrived in Subei, it was refused "entrance" by the CCP. How can such an executive group be expected to enforce the ceasefire order? Recently, there was no conflict in Hubei Province, but the CCP suddenly shouted loudly that the government army was surrounding the CCP army, and that there would be a large-scale war in Central China, and demanded that the executive group go to inspect. Later, the three-person group actually went, but what is the truth about the CCP's propaganda? Why is the three-person group silent? Also, the Northeast was originally not within the scope of mediation, but the Communist army first asked for mediation, and after forcibly occupying Changchun, the mediation department was ordered to send a group there. Why did the CCP say that there was no war in Changchun and that it was not necessary to go? We, the people, are looking forward day and night to the various parties who are planning for the country being able to jointly fulfill their promises and start the work of peaceful nation-building as soon as possible. Therefore, in our deep suffering, we endure the pain and put forward the following suggestions:</p>
<p>First, the plan for the reorganization and integration of the military should not only be quickly and universally implemented, and equally applicable to the Northeast, but also advocated to start with the Northeast first, and it is best to complete the reorganization in the shortest possible time. There is absolutely no reason for the CCP to ask for revisions. Only in this way can there be hope for a solution to the Northeast problem. And only from whether this plan is implemented can we see whether one side is sincerely seeking peace.</p>
<p>Second, the power of the executive group must be strengthened. It must not only have the power to enforce orders, but also the power to punish those who violate the ceasefire order of January 10th, regardless of which side of the troops violates the order. We hope that the various parties who are planning for the country will first reflect on whether their troops have stopped at the defense lines on January 13th, and then guarantee that their troops will immediately and absolutely follow the orders issued by the military mediation executive department. If there is mediation while there is conflict, mediation today and conflict tomorrow, conflict without end, mediation without end, it will be in vain, and it is definitely not the hope of the people.</p>
<p>Third, up to now, almost all conflicts in various places have been provoked by the CCP, but once the purpose of provocation is achieved, the CCP immediately chants "unconditional ceasefire," wanting the government and mediators to recognize its accomplished facts. The CCP's methods are indeed extremely "brilliant," but it will not be able to cover the eyes and ears of the people of the world with one hand. The common people will never allow any party to specialize in playing tricks, and today's common people are definitely not the "A Dou" of the past.</p>
<p>Fourth, the crux of the problem is that the military reorganization plan has not been implemented, resulting in the endless conflicts in the Northeast, North China, and Subei. Which side should be responsible for this? Who has not fulfilled their promise? Who is provoking? And who started first? The military mediation executive department should first investigate and clarify these questions and inform the people of the country so that everyone knows where right and wrong lie. If right and wrong are not discussed in the world, and only perfunctory treatment is given, things cannot be reasonably resolved, because "reason" is the reason for "right and wrong." If right and wrong are unclear, black and white are indistinguishable, and everyone is confused and only seeks temporary peace, then justice and fairness will be gone, and "reason" can no longer be discussed. What "reasonable" way is there to resolve the situation?</p>
<p>In short, if we want to break the current political impasse, we must strengthen the institution for implementing the military reorganization plan and start from the fair concept of distinguishing right from wrong. Only in this way can we make all parties unable to avoid fulfilling their promises and stopping the conflict. Only in this way can negotiations between the government and the CCP have a bright future. If the people cannot see this point, individuals ignore this key, and only want to be a peacemaker between the government and the CCP without being able to enforce reasonable agreements, then China will suffer and the people will suffer!</p>

<h3>Settling a Blood Debt of Fourteen Years; Japanese War Criminals Cannot Escape Censure; Xiang Zhe, Prosecutor, Attended the International Tribunal for the First Time Yesterday, Requesting Severe Sanctions Against the Defendants</h3>
<p>[Our Tokyo Correspondent, 14th]: This afternoon, the Japanese War Crimes Tribunal continued to debate the issue of individually trying the war criminals. Chinese Prosecutor Xiang Zhejun made a statement refuting the argument by the Japanese defense lawyers that there was no war between China and Japan before 1941. He stated that since 1931, the Chinese people have suffered from the persecution of Japanese war criminals. These war criminals must be severely sanctioned, otherwise, not only will peace not be maintained, but the Japanese people will continue to suffer from their poison.</p>
<p>Also today, former Foreign Minister Togo appeared in court and gave a wry smile to his German wife.</p>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 14th]: Chinese Prosecutor Xiang Zhejun of the Far East International Military Tribunal made his first appearance in court today. It is reported that China has suffered greatly from the devastation caused by Japanese war criminals, and justice will now be served in the international military tribunal. Since September 18, 1931, countless Chinese soldiers and civilians have been killed by the Japanese. Japanese leaders incited the people to oppress China. It is hoped that the court will be able to sentence the 28 defendants within a reasonable time and impose the punishment they deserve.</p>
<h3>American Lawyer Makes Preposterous Arguments, Defending Four Defendants, Attempting to Exculpate Them from the Crime of Mass Murder</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Tokyo, 14th]: The Far East International Tribunal continued to hold hearings today, trying Japanese war criminals. The chief American defense lawyer, Blakeney, representing four Japanese war criminals, namely former Prime Minister Hiranuma Kiichiro, former Foreign Minister Matsuoka Yosuke, former Foreign Minister (signer of the surrender document) Shigemitsu Mamoru, and former Kwantung Army Commander Umezu Yoshijiro, challenged the qualification of the tribunal. Mr. Blakeney cited three reasons: (1) The Supreme Court authorities proved that war is not a criminal act; (2) Killing enemies in war is not murder, and is no worse than the atomic bombing of Hiroshima; (3) If international treaties are violated, the Tokyo Tribunal has no jurisdiction to try the case, because the judges and prosecutors of this tribunal all represent the victorious countries. Chief Prosecutor Keenan rebutted, saying that the tribunal is composed of representatives of the Allied countries, and is in fact equal to a world court, except for the representatives of the Axis countries. If we want to form a court composed of neutral countries at this time, it would be difficult to find them even by searching the earth, unless we ask another planet. Australian Prosecutor Mansfield said that there should be a distinction between just and unjust wars, and between aggressive and defensive wars. Killing enemies in an unjust war is murder.</p>
<h3>Demonstrations by Starving People in Front of the Imperial Palace; Demanding the Emperor to Distribute Food</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Tokyo, 14th]: Today, 700 Japanese people, holding red flags and singing the Internationale, attempted to storm the Imperial Palace to petition. This group arrived at the palace gate at 11:15 AM, shouting "We demand the Emperor to distribute food." The guards tried to stop them without success, and finally allowed five representatives to enter, but the five representatives only met with representatives of the Ministry of the Imperial Household, who relayed their demands. The other demonstrators waited outside the gate until 5:30 PM, and then dispersed. On the same day, demonstrations surged like a tide in the afternoon, with the number of participants reaching one million. According to one of the representatives who entered the palace, "During the war, we were ready to die for the Emperor. Now the Emperor allows us to starve to death. How can he bear it?" A Japanese policeman replied, "If you want food, you'd better ask General MacArthur."</p>
<h3>Growing Rifts in the U.S. State Department Affect Diplomatic Policy; The Traditional Old and New Factions Continue to Clash; The Director of the Sino-American Intelligence Division Resigns as a Result</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 13th]: The internal rifts within the U.S. State Department are growing daily, which is bound to have a serious impact on various major U.S. foreign policies. Secretary of State Byrnes will have to deal with this major issue when he returns from Paris. The first to resign as a result of this infighting was Colonel McCormack, Director of the Sino-American Intelligence Division. His resignation is said to be due to opposition within the State Department, which rendered him helpless. The various departments of the State Department are now speculating, either that someone will follow suit and resign, or that there will be a major reshuffle this year. The speculation about who might resign is generally focused on Under Secretary of State Acheson, Assistant Secretary of State Clayton, and McCormack's successor, Rongjie. The crux of the infighting is the struggle between the traditional old and new factions, that is, the professional diplomats and the relatively new figures. The professional diplomats believe that the various departments of U.S. foreign relations should be presided over by them, so that a certain policy can be fully implemented from beginning to end, without changing halfway. Other non-professional diplomats, mostly lawyers and economists, believe that the United States must develop a progressive diplomatic policy line, and cannot be limited to what the diplomats provide. If the United States cannot promote a viable peace, then who in the world can shoulder this heavy responsibility? To accomplish this goal, these people must sincerely try to cooperate with the Soviet Union. Conversely, the professional diplomats advocate taking a firm stance against the Soviet Union's westward expansion of its influence. Acheson, Clayton, and Rongjie are all non-professional diplomats in the State Department (former Ambassador to China Hurley once referred to Acheson as a professional diplomat).</p>
<h3>Global Wartime Islands: The Issue of Base Disposal</h3>
<p>Being Discussed Between Britain and the United States</p>
<p>[Central News Agency London, 13th (United Press)] A British Foreign Office spokesman announced today: Britain and the United States are currently discussing the future handling of global wartime island bases. The discussions, which have been ongoing through diplomatic channels for several months, relate to the Azores, Christmas Island, Fornati Island, and Canton Island in the Pacific.</p>
<p>[Reuters London, 10th] British major newspapers today placed the matter of the United States requesting to share Pacific islands on the front page in a prominent position. Most newspapers opposed ceding British islands in the Pacific or elsewhere to the United States for use as bases.</p>
<h3>Senator Presents Evidence: US Military Aircraft Security Lax; Legislative Yuan Plans to Revise Espionage Law</h3>
<p>[United Press Washington, 13th] Senator Wiley revealed startling evidence today at a closed-door meeting of the Senate Judiciary Committee, exposing the lax security of US military aircraft. Wiley also stated: specialized engineering knowledge and secret weapons both hold significant military secret value. The committee is currently planning to draft a bill by the 17th of this month to revise the 30-year-old Espionage Act, adapting it for modern secrets concerning radar and atomic bombs. The committee also received the following testimonies: (1) The Soviet Union once intended to sign a contract with a certain electrical appliance manufacturing company, stipulating that the company allow Soviet engineers to intern at their factories. (2) The US Department of Commerce arbitrarily sold many specialized records, including those seized from Germany. Although US Army and Navy authorities did not consider these records confidential, the Soviet Union and France did not agree.</p>
<p>According to Committee Chairman Eastman, "Parts considered non-confidential, if collected, become confidential information." The US government should establish a special bureau to review contracts signed by foreign governments in the US.</p>

<h3>Hoover Submits Report After Inspecting World Famine; China Needs at Least 500,000 Tons of Grain Monthly; Hoover Ordered to Seek Cooperation in South America</h3>
<p>[Reuters Washington, 14th] President Truman's Food Envoy Hoover, upon returning to the country after inspecting various famine-stricken areas around the world, submitted a report to the President estimating that China needs 870,000 tons of grain from May 1st to the end of September. (According to a United Press report, Hoover told reporters that China's grain assistance needs at least 500,000 tons per month during this period, but he can only promise to obtain 200,000 tons per month. According to Chinese official opinion, this is the maximum amount that can be transported into the most severely famine-stricken areas of the country.) Japan also needs 870,000 tons, but Japan's needs are calculated based on transportation limitations, not its minimum need.</p>
<h3>Four Powers Reach Agreement on Italian Southern Border; Byrnes Proposes New Suggestions on Italian Colonies and German Issues</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] London, 14th Broadcast: The Council of Foreign Ministers continued to meet this morning to discuss the issues of the treaty with Italy and Trieste. It is rumored that the four foreign ministers have reached a considerable agreement on the border issue between Italy and Yugoslavia.</p>
<p>[United Press Paris, 14th] Reliable sources claimed today that the representatives of Britain and France at the Council of Foreign Ministers are willing to accept the internationalization of the port of Trieste in order to salvage the deadlock in the meeting. However, the United States and the Soviet Union firmly opposed it and were unwilling to concede. The United States originally supported Britain and France on this issue, but now its opinion is different, firmly insisting that the port of Trieste should remain under Italian control. The Soviet Union insists that the port of Trieste should be ceded to Yugoslavia, and it is also extremely firm. US officials said that this issue is the main crux of the failure to reach an agreement on the treaty with Italy.</p>
<p>[United Press Paris, 13th] The four foreign ministers have now reopened negotiations to decide the issue of when to convene a peace conference. US Secretary of State Byrnes today suggested assigning a temporary four-power committee to go to Germany to investigate the country's disarmament situation. The Soviet Union had accused that German troops still existed in the British occupation zone. Britain admitted that 120,000 former German soldiers are still retained in the forces necessary for occupation work.</p>

<h3>55 Principal Offenders Sentenced to Hang in Nazi Concentration Camp Massacre Case</h3>
<p>[United Press Dachau, Germany, 13th] The US military court trial of the large-scale murder case at the Sachsenhausen concentration camp has concluded. 58 principal offenders were sentenced to be hanged, and three others were sentenced to life imprisonment. The defendants murdered 70,000 prisoners in the concentration camp and are unforgivable. At the same time, the military court will try 75 members of the Nazi stormtroopers at the end of this week, who massacred US soldiers in the Battle of the Ardennes in France.</p>
<h3>Atomic Bomb Test Causing Earthquake? Warping Terrain? US Experts Believe Concerns Are Unnecessary</h3>
<p>[United Press Washington, 13th] Dr. Wulou, a physics professor at Yale University, sent a letter to the New York Times, fearing that testing atomic bombs at Bikini Atoll would cause earthquakes, and the harm would be unimaginable. Therefore, he believed that choosing the island as a test site was unwise. His theoretical concern is that the atomic bomb explosion may break through the bottom of the Pacific Ocean, causing seawater to rush in and come into contact with the Earth's core heat, leading to continuous earthquakes. The magnitude of the seismic force would be enough to make the Earth lose its balance, and the terrain would be warped. This continuous earthquake would also be enough to cause a tsunami, causing the tide to rise to a height of one mile or more. A reporter today asked Rear Admiral Parsons, Deputy Commander of the Army and Navy Test Forces, and Rear Admiral Level, an oceanographer and test consultant, about this matter. These two experts checked the records and statistics of earthquakes, submarine geography, and huge explosions to prove that Dr. Wulou's theory was unfounded and did not warrant attention. Their explanation is as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Although the power of a man-made atomic bomb explosion is astonishing, compared with natural earthquakes or ground fissures, it is nothing more than a small witch seeing a great witch. The energy generated by one major earthquake is about 100,000 times greater than that generated by one atomic bomb. The energy generated by an earthquake all enters the ground, while only one-thousandth of the energy generated by an atomic bomb is absorbed into the ground. Based on this calculation, the energy generated by a major earthquake is about 100 million times greater than the energy generated by an atomic bomb.</p>
<p>(2) Assuming that there is a volcanic layer in the Bikini area (however, the test supervisors do not make this assumption), then the atomic bomb is exploded slightly below the water surface during the second test, and this volcanic layer is still more than 21,000 feet below the explosion site. 21,000 feet is the height of Bikini Atoll from the bottom of the Pacific Ocean. The reef is located on the top of a high peak. Even if the high peak was once an active volcano, its volcanic heart must have solidified early. The high peak has now become hard rock, and the top and slopes are covered with a thick layer of coral.</p>
<p>(3) It is credible that there are no active volcanoes within 2,000 miles around Bikini.</p>
<p>(4) If it is said that volcanic eruptions may warp the terrain, then "this Earth is so sensitive, and so many past tsunamis and earthquakes must have been enough to make it suffer." Taking the Krakatoa land fissure in the Sumatra and Java area in 1883 as an example, when seawater seeped into the super-ripe base under the island, the stone that exploded was 14 square miles. Krakatoa is located at 6 degrees south of the equator. If land fissures may affect the terrain, then the land fissure there is enough to affect the rotation of the earth. If there is still no resolution within this year, this issue will be submitted to the United Nations organization. In addition, the four countries should jointly form a committee, authorized by the Allied Control Council for Germany, to go to the four occupation zones of Germany to inspect the extent to which Germany has been disarmed.</p>
<h3>Italian New King Awards Decorations to Our Charge d'Affaires to Italy</h3>
<p>Former King Changes Title to Count of Pollenzo</p>
<p>[Central News Agency London, 13th] The new King of Italy, Umberto II, received Xue Guangqian, our charge d'affaires to Italy, in Rome yesterday and awarded him the Grand Officer Decoration. The newly appointed Ambassador to Italy, Yu Junji, is expected to arrive in Rome around the 23rd.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency New York, 13th Dispatch] Our Ambassador to Italy, Yu Junji, is scheduled to take a ship to Southampton on the 13th night and transfer to Rome. Need. The Philippines needs 60,000 tons during the same period, and Korea also needs 110,000 tons. The minimum need for the Indian Ocean region during the same period is 886,000 tons. Hoover opposed the United States bearing full responsibility for famine relief. Although the Western Hemisphere should do its best to assist, the Indian Ocean region should also mobilize its resources as much as possible.</p>
<p>Hoover's report stated that from May 1st to September 30th, the world needs a total of 14,484,400 tons of food. The possible supply during the same period is 10,897,700 tons, so there is a shortage of approximately 3,600,000 tons. Hoover further stated at a press conference that in order to avoid collective famine, continuous efforts are needed. He believes that by the end of August, if the surplus countries can step up their savings and maintain a spirit of cooperation, then the remaining shortfall will not be difficult to make up for the most part.</p>
<p>[Reuters Washington, 14th] Hoover, at the request of President Truman, will visit South America as a food envoy to seek the assistance of South American countries in relieving the world famine.</p>

<h3>Special Agents Commit Heinous Crimes; Held Important Positions in Puppet Organizations; Arch-Traitor Su Chengde on Trial; Secretly Murdered Party Committee Martyr Zhang Xiaotong; Mrs. Zhang Testifies in Court, Weeping</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] At 8:50 AM yesterday morning, Chief Judge Xiao Bianfen of the High Court presided over the trial of arch-traitor Su Chengde in the newly established Special Criminal Court on the third floor of the Shanghai Prison in Tilanqiao. Su Chengde was from Jining, Shandong, 46 years old, and lived at 540 Haige Road. He successively served as the Deputy Captain of the Action Team of the Investigation Section of the Central Party Headquarters, and the Director of the Investigation Sections of the Party Headquarters of Beijing-Shanghai, Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo, and the two routes. In September of the Republic of China's 28th year (1939), he was secretly active in Shanghai and was captured by the enemy puppets to "76", where he was persuaded by traitor Zhou Fohai to join the puppet organization. He initially served as the Director of the Fourth Division of the Puppet Special Agent Headquarters, handling personnel adjustments. In less than a month, he was transferred to the Nanjing District Director of the department, responsible for the security of the puppet government's return to the capital, and helping to find houses for various agencies, and maintaining local security. The district also had a detention center, detaining arrested underground workers. In the 29th year (1940), Zhang Xiaotong, a former member of the Shanghai Municipal Party Headquarters, was secretly active in Shanghai, was arrested by the enemy and escorted to the detention center, and was secretly executed by the puppet enemy's headquarters. Traitor Ding Shijun was sent to supervise the execution. The defendant then ordered Traitor Tong Guozhong and others to strangle him, and the defendant also took a photo to report.</p>
<p>In March of the same year, he was transferred to serve as a puppet Central Supervisory Committee member; in June, he was transferred to serve as the Director of the Special Police Department of the Puppet Police Administration Department, governing special police affairs such as water, railway, forestry, and mining, in addition to the ordinary administrative police, and established a Special Police Training Institute, with the defendant serving as the director concurrently, training the aforementioned special police. In the 30th year (1941), he was transferred to serve as the Director of the Puppet Nanjing Police Department. In February of the 31st year (1942), the position of Director of the Puppet Nanjing Police Department was changed to Superintendent General of the Puppet Capital Police, which was still held by the defendant. In October of the same year, he was transferred to serve as a member of the Puppet Military Affairs Committee. In January of the 32nd year (1943), he was transferred to serve as the Director of the Puppet Political Work Bureau, handling intelligence and special propaganda affairs. He also incorporated a brigade of the 89th Army of Northern Jiangsu into the puppet army to enhance the strength of the puppet regime. In August of the same year, he served as the Deputy Director of the 1st, 3rd, and 2nd Bureaus of the Shanghai Police Bureau, handling Baosjia (collective responsibility system), education, and security, etc., until after the victory, when he was arrested by military agencies. After investigation by the High Prosecutor's Office, the prosecution was filed.</p>
<p>During the interrogation yesterday morning, the defendant was tall and burly, wearing a dark blue serge robe, and tortoise-shell-rimmed glasses, arrogant and unrestrained; the prestige of the puppet secret agent chief had not completely disappeared. He even denied the Zhang Xiaotong murder incident. Chief Judge Xiao then summoned Zhang Xiaotong's widow, Chen Juexian, the principal of the Municipal Dongming Elementary School. According to her testimony, her husband originally worked at the Party Headquarters, and on January 14th of the 19th year (1930), he was arrested by the enemy and his life and death were unknown. When she heard that a memorial service had been held in Chongqing, she learned that he had been murdered. After the victory, Xu Shaoyu of the Military Intelligence Bureau's office in Jiangsu informed her of the place of death, so she took leave to go but did not find the remains. She applied three points in court: (1) Strictly interrogate the traitor Su to find out when Zhang Xiaotong died and where he was buried; (2) Investigate other criminals who instigated the execution of Zhang Xiaotong; (3) Return the blood photo of Zhang Xiaotong stored in the traitor Su's house to keep it for remembrance. Her words were filled with tears and she cried uncontrollably. After summoning several witnesses called by the defendant, the court ordered a rescheduling of the interrogation and the defendant was returned to custody.</p>
<p>Two Indian Traitors Retried</p>
<p>The Special Criminal Court on the second floor of the Tilanqiao High Court retried Indian traitors Nanak Chand and Bope yesterday morning. Nanak Chand participated in the Indian independence movement in his early years and was hunted down by the British government, so he fled to Shanghai. In the winter of the 30th year of the Republic of China (1941), Bose colluded with the Japanese army to organize the Indian Independence League in our occupied areas, leading the Indian community to fight for independence. Nanak Chand served as the chairman. Bope knew Japanese and served as a liaison officer for the enemy. The two traitors made absurd remarks to please the enemy and seized the opportunity to make money. Last year, Indians Wu Huazu, Narunxing, and Huahaweixing, etc., all came to court to testify about their experiences of being harmed. The defendant still tried to shirk responsibility, and said that his assumption of the position was only because of different political views, and that it was for the sake of fighting for independence. The court ordered the defendant to be returned to custody and rescheduled the interrogation.</p>
<p>Supplies Enemy, Harms the Country</p>
<p>The trial continued of Wu Yonghua, Chairman of the Puppet Automobile Parts and Accessories Trade Association, for using automobiles, Chuanpin (brand name), and hardware to supply the enemy, and for purchasing automobile engines for the enemy to manufacture enemy suicide aircraft; and Xu Zhiren, a rice merchant, for purchasing 3,000 piculs of rice for the enemy, for supplying the enemy with supplies. The defendants all claimed that they were forced by the evil forces of the enemy puppets and did not willingly attach themselves to the enemy. After the presiding judge interrogated them one by one, he ordered a rescheduling of the interrogation. The Shanghai Higher Court Prosecutor's Office has completed the investigation of the cases of Dai Yingfu, the puppet Shanghai Education Bureau Director, and Ma Haoqing, who were suspected of being traitors, and has formally filed a public prosecution.</p>

<h3>Tram Workers Demand Increased Base Pay; Restricted by Executive Yuan Order; Social Affairs Bureau Unable to Accept; Orders Labor and Management to Negotiate on Their Own</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Regarding the labor dispute at the tram company, in addition to the issues of sick leave, retirement benefits, and reinstatement of laid-off workers, which have already been resolved, the company has also agreed to other points, such as working six days with one day off, holidays on national commemorative days, and double pay for working on holidays. The only remaining unresolved issue is the labor's demand for an adjustment to base pay. However, because the Executive Yuan has ordered the municipal government that workers' base pay cannot be increased starting in April of this year, the Social Affairs Bureau cannot accept this demand from the labor side. Yesterday, the person in charge on the management side told reporters that they currently have no opinion and are only waiting for the Social Affairs Bureau to mediate and make a decision. The bureau, however, is restricted by regulations and cannot discuss the matter, so it has ordered labor and management to negotiate on their own to find a solution. It is not impossible to consider increasing allowances under a different name.</p>

<h3>Taikoo Line Still Has Not Replaced Foreign Sailors with Chinese</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] After the resumption of service by the British-owned Taikoo Line steamship company, the Jinan and Fuzhou ships have not yet replaced foreign sailors with Chinese. Despite repeated warnings from the Seamen's Union, the British manager of the company has negotiated with the Seamen's Union several times, but the replacement of foreign sailors has not been implemented, leading to a strike. As a result, the two ships have been in Shanghai for nearly two weeks, and goods have not been unloaded, with exports even further off, resulting in considerable losses. It is reported that the Seamen's Union issued a final warning to the company yesterday. If the issue is not resolved today, it may affect other ships. Currently, in addition to the Jinan and Fuzhou, the company has five ships in Shanghai, including the Hubei, Shandong, and Hanyang, which arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning. If the company cannot satisfy the Seamen's Union today, all work may be halted.</p>
<h3>Rescuing Unemployed Workers Is Important; Rescuing Factories Is More Urgent; Wu Kaixian Discusses Convening a Production Conference to Seek Solutions</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Mr. Wu Kaixian stated: While rescuing unemployed workers is important, rescuing factories is even more urgent. Only with factories can ways be found to accommodate workers. Therefore, he is joining forces with relevant agencies to prepare for another production conference to seek solutions. The issues proposed for discussion at the conference are: (1) Requesting the government to provide large-scale industrial loans to improve or add to the equipment of private factories and to purchase production materials. (2) Helping and urging factories to improve personnel management. According to current statistics, the number of employees in some factories after the victory has increased by one-third compared to the enemy-puppet period. Now, reduce unnecessary redundant personnel and try to accommodate more workers. (3) Purchasing foreign rice to suppress rice prices. This is a fundamental issue and has a great impact on the future of industry and commerce. (4) Rectifying labor discipline. Mr. Wu also mentioned that after the establishment of the Labor-Management Arbitration Committee, in addition to the meeting already held, another meeting will be convened soon. Furthermore, Mr. Wu accompanied Mr. Zhu Xuefan, the person in charge of the Chinese Labor Association, to Beijing last night to meet with Chairman Chiang, as requested by Chairman Chiang.</p>
<h3>Reinstatement of Unemployed Workers; Symposium Held to Discuss Solutions</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The Reinstatement Committee of the Hudong District of this city includes more than 20,000 unemployed workers from various industries such as copper smelting, rubber, chemicals, dyeing and weaving, docks, machinery manufacturing, silk weaving, and timber transportation. These factories were taken over by military and political organs after the victory and have not yet resumed production. At the same time, employed workers have also organized a Reinstatement Promotion Association. They held a meeting on the afternoon of the 9th and resolved eight points for the Bureau's reference, including: (1) Those who have resumed work should expand as much as possible, and those who have not resumed work should resume work within a limited time. Factories sold at auction should resume work within two weeks after the winning bid. Whether each factory can expand or resume work should be investigated and decided by a factory investigation team organized by the attending agencies, and then immediately handled. (2) Before work is resumed, the government should organize a Shanghai Hudong District Unemployed Workers Reception Center to accommodate them. (3) Launch a work resumption movement and raise work resumption funds as a fund for establishing cooperative factories. The government should allocate factory machinery and raw materials to settle unemployed workers. (4) Factories sold at auction should continue working and employ the original unemployed workers. (5) The Enemy-Puppet Property Management Bureau has received a large amount of funds from the disposal of enemy-puppet property and should allocate it as industrial loans.</p>
<p>The Association, together with unemployed workers who came to Shanghai from the rear, held a symposium at the Social Affairs Bureau yesterday afternoon with relevant agencies to discuss solutions for the reinstatement of unemployed workers. More than 30 representatives from organizations such as the Shanghai Branch of the "Executive Headquarters," the Jiangsu-Zhejiang-Anhui Enemy-Puppet Property Management Bureau, the Special Commissioner's Office of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, China Silk Company, China Textile Company, the Shanghai Office of the Resources Committee, and various labor unions in the Hudong District attended. Mr. Zhao Banfu, Director of the Labor Department of the Social Affairs Bureau, served as chairman. Representatives of unemployed workers requested the Good Relief General Administration to (1) distribute relief supplies, (2) establish a Shanghai Unemployed Workers Reception Center, (3) establish a clinic, and (4) postpone the closing of the Reception Center for unemployed workers who came to Shanghai from the rear. They also requested the factories taken over by various agencies to resume work as soon as possible. After exchanging views, they strongly agreed on several points such as organizing a factory investigation team, and promised to forward other items to the superiors of the agencies for a decision.</p>

<h3>Female Con Artist Wang Guoying on Trial; Wearing Western Suit and Pompadour; Loudly Proclaiming Innocence; Confrontation in Court; Arguing Over "Conscience"</h3>
<p>(Our Newspaper's Report) The case of female con artist Wang Guoying, along with Sun Gongdu and Zhang Weisheng, jointly defrauding others of property, has been brought to public prosecution by the District Prosecutor's Office. The main points of the indictment were recorded in this newspaper on the 7th. At 2:30 PM yesterday, Judge Cao Zuwei opened the Third Criminal Division of the District Court for the first hearing. Wang Guoying had a mannish Western haircut, wore a light gray Western suit, a red and white polka-dot tie, and cream-colored leather shoes. She and the two other defendants, Sun and Zhang, were brought to the defendant's seat by judicial police officers Zhang Ji and Pan Zhupeng. She denied all the fraud described in the indictment, loudly proclaiming that she was wronged. After Judge Cao questioned them one by one, he ordered a postponement of the trial and the defendants were remanded.</p>
<p>Using the Pretext of Bailing Out Traitors to Extort Relatives</p>
<p>Wang is from Beiping, a Muslim, 34 years old, residing at Room 714 of the Jinmen Hotel, claiming to be a specialist from the Accounting Department of the National Government, who came to Shanghai to raise funds for refugee relief. On April 3 of this year, through the introduction of her fellow townsman Sun Gongdu (44 years old) and Zhang Weisheng (47 years old, from Tongzhou, Hebei), she extorted the relatives of Wu Yonghua, who was accused of being a traitor, using the excuse of bailing him out, obtaining a total of 5 million yuan, but Wu was still not released. At the same time, Sun Gongdu wanted to share the stolen money but failed, so he reported to the police station, and Wang was arrested. At the start of the trial, Judge Cao first questioned the witness Ya Yonglu (from Beiping, 50 years old, engaged in transportation). After reading the interrogation record of the police station, Ya Yonglu described that he was asked by Wang Guoying to send a ship ticket to Wang's brother Zuomin at Room 341 of the Oriental Hotel, and he saw Sun Gongdu arguing with Wang's brother and sister-in-law, saying that he would not be able to face his friends if he did not get back 2.5 million yuan. He mediated, but denied that he said that Wang and Sun had jointly defrauded 5 million yuan.</p>
<p>Feigning Surprise in Court; Saying She Didn't Know Them</p>
<p>Subsequently, Yu Xinggeng, the wife of Wu Yonghua (from Yuyao, Zhejiang, 32 years old, residing at 367 Weihaiwei Road), testified that she had seen Wang Guoying twice: once at the Nanlaishun mutton restaurant in Dongxinqiao, and once upstairs at Deji Hardware Store, both introduced by Zhang Weisheng, but she did not speak. She also said that Zhang had been her neighbor for more than ten years, with a straightforward personality, and she believed that Zhang was a good person and would not harm her. Zhang repeatedly assured her that he could bail out her husband Wu Yonghua, and because her child was seriously ill and she hoped to see her husband, she paid 3 million yuan. As for the other 2 million yuan advanced by Deji Hardware Store, she did not know. She also did not know Wang Guoying, nor did she know Sun Gongdu. Then, Xu Zouqiaoying (from Changshu, 40 years old, residing at 333 Weihaiwei Road, her husband is a student of Wu Yonghua) testified that she saw Wang Guoying when Wang went to her house on April 5 to pick up 2 million yuan. At that time, Wang was wearing a blue cheongsam and not a Western suit. Judge Cao then questioned Wang Guoying, and she denied as before, so he ordered the defendants and witnesses to confront each other in court. Wang feigned surprise and said, "I don't know them at all!" However, she could not completely conceal her panic.</p>
<p>Completely Out of Sentiment; Helping Out of Kindness</p>
<p>Judge Cao asked why her brother and sister lived in two hotels in Shanghai. She replied, "He arrived later than me, and the Jingu Hotel had no rooms." He asked, "Are you married?" She replied, "I am married. My husband, Chen Weiyan, is in Hanoi, working as a staff officer at the Hanoi Office of the Ministry of Military Affairs." He asked, "The witnesses have no grudges against you, why would they all say you did this?" She replied, "I received higher education and dare not break the law. This matter is completely unjust." He asked, "How much education did you receive?" She replied, "I graduated from the Journalism Department of Beiping Pingmin University." Subsequently, Judge Cao ordered Wang to confront Sun Gongdu and Zhang Weisheng. Wang claimed that she was subjected to this conspiracy because she had not agreed to Sun Gongdu's investment in business, and Sun claimed that he requested the return of 2.5 million yuan completely out of sentiment, and it must be returned to the original owner, Wang, not for sharing the spoils. As for Zhang Weisheng, he said that he was completely helping out of kindness, how would he dare to defraud? In the defendant's seat, the three defendants argued over conscience, not knowing whose conscience was on them. Judge Cao stopped the interrogation due to time constraints. Wang Guoying strongly demanded to explain the inside story, but Judge Cao stopped her and ordered her to submit a written defense. Wang's lawyer, Ma Nangeng, requested that the defendant be released on bail, but it was not approved. The court ordered another hearing at 2 PM on the 16th.</p>

<h3>False Alarm at the Grand Theatre; Bullets Thrown from Upper Floors; Theatregoer Injured</h3>
<p>(Our Newspaper's Report) At around 10 o'clock last night, at the Grand Theatre on Jiujiang Road, 50 to 60 soldiers were watching a play. Suddenly, seven or eight bullets were thrown down from the upper floors. One bullet hit Mrs. Hu (25 years old, residing at No. 1, Alley 602, Huanlong Road), who was in the first seat of the fourth row in the main hall, in the head. Afterwards, in order to prevent the audience from panicking, the theater immediately carried the injured person to the hospital, closed the iron gate tightly, and the Laozha patrol team rushed to the scene. The group leader gave a speech, ordering the person who threw the bullets to come forward, but no one responded. They had to take all the soldiers back to the patrol team in police cars for investigation. It is reported that the bullets were the latest yellow American lead bullets, extremely sharp. According to the person in charge of the theater, it was recently stipulated that soldiers who did not buy tickets to watch the play must go to the third-floor box. The throwing of bullets may have been caused by this dissatisfaction.</p>

As for the various emergency taxes payable in 1945, they should be exempted. This document was personally presented by Mr. Wang to Minister Yu of the Ministry of Finance. Minister Yu said that he would consider it carefully, but it must be forwarded to the Supreme National Defense Council for approval before it can be implemented. Regarding the issue of labor unrest, it is planned to start from the aspect of labor-management welfare, and strive to take into account the welfare of both labor and management as a prerequisite. It is also reported that after the convening of this expanded preparatory meeting, the inaugural meeting is expected to be held between autumn and winter of this year, with the general association to be located in Nanjing and an office to be established in Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Zhoushan Ship Sails on Fuzhou Line; Dahua Ship Suffers Mechanical Failure En Route</h3>
<p>(Our Newspaper's Report) After the resumption of business in Shanghai after the victory, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company first resumed the Shanghai-Ningbo line (i.e., Shanghai to Ningbo). At that time, due to a lack of ships, it chartered the Zhoushan ship from the Zhoushan Company. Yesterday, the ship returned to Shanghai, and because it had long been due, it was taken back by the Zhoushan Company and sailed on the Fuzhou line, also serving Ningbo. It is scheduled to sail on Friday (the 17th) of this week, and the passenger tickets have been sold out. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company has no ships to send to the Shanghai-Ningbo line, so it has been suspended in effect. Also, the Dahua ship of the Ping An Shipping Bureau was returning to Shanghai from Ningbo the day before. It dropped anchor at 3 PM and sailed for four hours after leaving Zhenhai, reaching the waters of Ligang Port. The machinery suddenly failed, and the ship anchored in the port, and sent a telegram to Shanghai for help. The Bureau has ordered the Ningbo line to send an escort team to protect it and provide food. The crew and passengers are safe, and the Shanghai Bureau is trying to send a ship to tow it to Shanghai for repairs.</p>

<p>According to the Meteorological Observatory, a new hurricane has risen in the Pacific Ocean and is now approaching Guam. If its direction does not change, Shanghai will be disturbed by it.

<p>[Our Newspaper's Special Report from Huaiyuan] Huaiyuan has always been the cultural center of northern Anhui. Since the July 7th Incident, it fell into enemy hands, and all construction was completely destroyed. After the victory, the Anhui Provincial Education Association sent Zhou Ping as principal to establish the Provincial Huaiyuan Middle School to help the out-of-school youth in northern Anhui. At that time, because there were no school buildings or equipment, and the Education Bureau had insufficient funds to pay, the school temporarily borrowed the girls' department of the private Huaixi Middle School for classes, and at the same time raised funds and collected equipment to prepare for the construction of the school. Later, after the gentry of the county decided to demolish the abandoned temples inside and outside the county seat, they subsidized the construction. The students of the school, eager to build the school, spared no time, and followed the principal and teachers to move bricks and tiles, which has been going on for more than a day.</p>
<p>Shooting indiscriminately</p>
<p>On the afternoon of the 8th of this month, all the teachers and students went to the Dawang Temple on the north bank of the Wo River to fetch school construction materials, going back and forth between the ferry crossings. At that time, it happened that a large boat sealed by the 12th Anti-Gas Squad of the Military Administration Department stationed in Huaiyuan docked at the shore. The squad immediately conscripted laborers to move goods, forcing the school's workers to participate. The students of the school, feeling they each had their own responsibilities, stepped forward to reason with them, but the soldiers of the squad uttered insults and fired shots, and tied up the school's discipline instructor and many students, immersing them in water and subjecting them to extreme humiliation. At that moment, Principal Zhou Ping rushed from the north bank of the Wo River to the south bank, found the Squad Leader Shang Yong, and politely negotiated, and the incident was calmed down. The students then followed the orders of the teachers and continued to move the materials, without suspecting anything else. Unexpectedly, more than 30 soldiers from the squad rushed out of the city, led by Platoon Leader Hu Zhonggui, armed with live ammunition, as if facing a formidable enemy, and rushed to the "Shuimenkou Ferry Crossing," indiscriminately opening fire. The teachers and students of the school were empty-handed and unable to resist, causing student Yuan Yongkun to die on the spot, Sun Mingde was shot in the abdomen, his condition was critical, Ruan Zhenhua's back was injured and his tendons were broken, leaving him crippled, and Li Guangyi was stabbed with a bayonet. The others who were slightly injured and fell into the water were not few in number.</p>
<p>With Military Discipline, What Reliance on People's Lives?</p>
<p>This horrific scene is infuriating. Recently, all the students of the school issued a declaration, making a heartfelt appeal to the whole country, stating: "The state raises soldiers to protect the territory and secure the people, but now they rely on force to kill students, disregard the law, and treat human lives like grass. The remnants of warlords would not go so far. If the instigators are not strictly investigated and the murderers are not brought to justice, how can military discipline be preserved? What reliance is there on people's lives? All the students of our Provincial Huaiyuan Middle School, for the sake of loving the school, loving the country, and loving our compatriots, vow to do our best to uphold justice, preferring to be shattered like jade rather than remaining whole like tile. We hope that the people of the whole country will uphold justice, protect education, and protect the youth, and give us their support!" and so on.</p>
<p>The Public is Alarmed and Expresses Extreme Indignation</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report from Bengbu] Students from Anhui Provincial Huaiyuan Middle School had a conflict with the 12th Anti-Gas Squad stationed in Huaiyuan on the bank of the Huai River. The squad leader led soldiers to shoot and kill student Yuan Yongkun, and also shot and wounded Sun Mingde, Ruan Zhenhua, and others. It is now known that when the students of various middle schools here heard the news, the public was alarmed and expressed extreme indignation. They were very concerned about the dead and wounded, and starting from the 11th, they continuously and automatically raised funds from students at all levels to send to Huaiyuan Middle School to express condolences to the families of the dead and wounded. The Anti-Gas Squad will probably be completely disarmed in the next few days. (Super)</p>

<h3>Chen Shaoxian Returns from Inspecting Nanyang: Reports on the Situation of Overseas Chinese Education; The Fastest Recovery Among Overseas Chinese Schools in Malaya</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report from Hong Kong] The education community here held a tea party at the Hong Kong Hotel at 3:00 PM on the 8th to welcome Councilor Chen Shaoxian, who recently returned to the country via Hong Kong after visiting Nanyang. Earlier this year, Mr. Chen was ordered to represent the Ministry of Education to inspect overseas Chinese education in various parts of Nanyang and to discuss related issues such as the development of overseas Chinese education with the local governments. More than 40 representatives of principals of various schools in Hong Kong and Kowloon, including Huang Zufen, attended the meeting on this day. Chairman Yuan Shuibo gave a welcoming speech, followed by Chen Shaoxian's report on his observations during the inspection. According to him, the government, in order to urgently understand the situation of overseas Chinese schools in various parts of Nanyang that had been devastated by the enemy for more than three years, and the historical facts of educators sacrificing for justice during the war, sent him to go, and it will be four months now. When he departed from Chongqing, he did not expect the rapid recovery of overseas Chinese schools in Nanyang. Although less than half of the overseas Chinese schools have been restored, the ratio of students is higher than before.</p>
<p>Siam</p>
<p>In the past few years, it was completely controlled by the enemy, and its government regarded our overseas Chinese as enemies. The number of schools that were sealed off and teachers who were arrested was the largest. Since the enemy surrendered, the situation has improved. When we arrived, the anti-Chinese sentiment in Siam was still very strong, so not a single formal school had resumed classes, but there were many "private schools." Recently, our country signed a treaty of friendship with Siam, and it can be restored to the state before the Pacific War. Before the war, there were 169 overseas Chinese schools in Siam.</p>
<p>Burma</p>
<p>In Burma, there were originally 347 overseas Chinese schools. As of January, 63 schools had been restored. In Penang, which belongs to Malaya, there were originally 221 schools, including two middle schools. By February, all of them had been restored, and 90 primary schools had also resumed classes.</p>
<p>Nanyang</p>
<p>Perak had 239 schools, including eight middle schools. As of February, 109 schools had been restored, including two middle schools. Singapore originally had 277 schools, including seven middle schools. As of March, 97 schools had been restored, including two middle schools. Vietnam had 349 schools, including four middle schools, and 150 schools had been restored.</p>
<p>Eager to Serve the Country</p>
<p>Mr. Chen pointed out that the overseas Chinese economy after the war was extremely tight. The rubber, tin ore, and rice industries were all controlled by the government, and military tickets were abolished, causing the propertied to go bankrupt. However, based on years of oppression by the enemy, the overseas Chinese's eagerness to serve the country was even stronger, and their assistance in the development of education was especially doubled. The thriving trend of reading Chinese texts from below can be taken as an example. In the past, many children of overseas Chinese only read foreign texts and did not pay attention to their own national language. This concept has been completely eliminated. As a result, there are more students than before, and there is a phenomenon of supply not meeting demand in a school.</p>
<p>Future Improvements</p>
<p>The areas that need to be improved in overseas Chinese schools in the future are school equipment, teaching methods, overseas Chinese curriculum, and the improvement of students' Chinese proficiency. Mr. Chen also advocated that the government should send more personnel to inspect them and establish liaison agencies in several important places to allow overseas Chinese to gain a better understanding of the educational situation in the motherland. At the same time, teachers who are proficient in Mandarin in the country are also in demand overseas. Mr. Chen also reported that when he inspected various places, he had discussed the improvement of overseas Chinese education with the local governments in a friendly and harmonious atmosphere, especially the most issues raised in Singapore, such as the issue of government subsidies, etc., and received full assistance from friendly countries. Mr. Chen will stay in Hong Kong for a few days before returning to Guangzhou and then to Beijing.</p>
<p>Changing Concepts</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Guangzhou, 13th] This reporter interviewed Councilor Chen Shaoxian, who had just returned from inspecting Nanyang. According to him, the recovery of overseas Chinese schools is fastest in Malaya, followed by Vietnam, and then Burma. The total number of schools restored in the three places is only half of what it was before the war, but the number of students is the same. In Siam, formal schools have not yet been restored, and there are only private schools left. After the war, overseas Chinese all attached importance to their children's education. They felt that China's international status had been improved, so they changed the bad concept of making their children specialize in English before the war, and instead sent their children to overseas Chinese schools. The number of students in each school has now increased sharply.</p>
<h3>US Elementary and Secondary Schools Officially Recognize Newspapers as Supplementary Textbooks: Increasing Students' Interest in the Curriculum</h3>
<p>[US News Service New York, 13th] New York City's elementary and secondary schools have officially recognized newspapers as supplementary textbooks.

<h3>Central Bank Intervention Stabilizes Gold Prices Yesterday; U.S. Dollar Follows Gold Market Fluctuations</h3>
<p>Gold prices slightly stabilized yesterday. The morning opening was still pushed high to around 1.85 million, but it was only temporary. There were some who sold for profit at the high price, and soon it retreated before rebounding. Ultimately, with increased pressure from the Central Bank, and the U.S. dollar still being sold for supply, it once fell below 1.75 million before maintaining. Around 10 o'clock, the Central Bank allocated according to Article 291 to dealers at a price of 1.78 million. Dealers considered the price too high and requested returns. After that, the situation stabilized, once rebounding to 1.82 million, but soon felt pressure and turned sideways. At noon, it was still hovering around the allocation price. The momentary gold rush has gradually subsided. In the afternoon, over-the-counter sales in silver shops were sluggish, the situation was calm, and there was little change. As a result, the closing price was down 25,000 compared to the previous day, ornamental gold was at 190,000, sycee silver was at 1,700, and silver dollars were offered at 1,100. The informal loan market slightly eased, with interest rates from 1.5 to 1.8 fen.</p>
<p>The foreign exchange U.S. dollar was mediocre, fluctuating with the gold market. After the morning opening, it gradually fell from around 2350 yuan to around 2270 yuan. At noon, it struggled around 2300 yuan. The arbitrage spread widened to around 770 yuan, a result of speculative activity favoring gold over dollars. After the gold market stabilized in the afternoon, the U.S. dollar was still hovering around 2300 yuan. As a result, the closing price was down 20 yuan compared to the previous day. Hong Kong currency was weak and tired, with old bills down 2 yuan and new bills down 5 yuan. The Hong Kong exchange rate retreated from 420 yuan to 410 yuan. The rupee was offered at 520 yuan. The U.S. exchange rate remained flat.</p>
<h3>Government Bonds Continue to Rise; Chinese Stocks Occasionally Show Promise</h3>
<p>Government bonds continued to trend upwards, but the situation was uncertain. Unified Series C opened flat in the morning. After opening, large investors continued to buy actively, gradually pushing the price up to around 7700 yuan. Some of the bulls began to take profits, and the market price subsequently fell back. At noon, it hovered around 7350 yuan. As a result, the closing price was up 250 yuan compared to the previous day. Series A and B also rose 150 yuan, while Series D and E each rose 100 yuan. Some large investors occasionally pulled up Chinese stocks, hoping to salvage the situation, occasionally showing promise. The highest prices were 5250 yuan for Yong Spinning, 4350 yuan for American-Asia, 355 yuan for Jingfu, 295 yuan for Xinguang, and 250 yuan for Qinxing. Large investors were only prepared to support small stocks, and did not pay attention to them, affecting many retail investors and speculative funds. Large stocks also lost support and retreated at noon. All stocks closed at lower prices. As a result, the closing prices of Yong Spinning and American-Asia were not much different from the previous day. Jingfu and the other three small stocks continued to decline slightly. Medium-sized stocks were mixed, while small, unpopular stocks recovered slightly. Veteran stocks were still difficult to push forward, and it was difficult to find buyers due to oversupply. The afternoon situation was quiet. Foreign stocks were still dominated by the intentions of the securities firms. Foreign merchants mostly observed from the sidelines, and eventually also retreated. Yi Spinning conducted transactions above the previous closing price before gradually being suppressed by long positions taking profits and declining slightly. The paper industry was stabilized by speculative buying from small securities firms. The rest closed with slight declines.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Thread Rise Together; Cotton Cloth is Flat</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the yarn market saw thread prices rise, and yarn prices remain flat. The morning began with high expectations, and prices for all types of yarn and thread rose by tens of thousands. For example, 42-count Blue Bale initially traded at 2.1 million before falling back to 2.05 million as long positions took profits and sold. As a result, it was still up 100,000 from yesterday's price. The Beijing market saw strong demand for 20-count small and medium-sized yarns, which also rose by 20,000. Sales of Da [illegible] yarn were scarce due to the lack of activity from the Guangdong market, with only a dozen or two pieces being purchased by the Shantou market.</p>
<p>Also reported, the Central Trust Bureau, acting as agent for the Committee for the Disposal of Government Materials and Properties, sold yarn, cloth, rayon and other goods in its second public auction. Among them were four groups of yarn and thread, each group consisting of thirty to forty pieces, all of which were bid for and won by Heng Kang Yarn Company at the highest price, which was not much different from the market price.</p>
<p>The cloth market was not as active as the yarn market. As a result, only the prices of Meiting Shirting, Four Gentlemen Drill, and Damu Official Cloth slightly strengthened, while the prices of the remaining brands remained completely unchanged.</p>
<p>The New York cotton market reported a decline of 5 to 9 points, with near-term American cotton at 27.34 U.S. dollars, and far-term at 27.86 U.S. dollars. The spot price for Midling cotton was 28.15 U.S. dollars. The current cotton market in this city saw high prices and sluggish sales.</p>
<h3>Seafood Sales Sluggish</h3>
<p>Sales of all kinds of seafood are quite slow. Upon investigation, the reason is that over-the-counter sales are inactive, shipments continue to arrive, and tight credit conditions are particularly damaging. Fujian fine cinnamon opened as high as 375,000 yuan before falling to 200,000 yuan. The rest of the goods were all in decline.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market Initially Tight, Then Flat; 10,000 Tons of Taiwan Sugar Arriving Soon</h3>
<p>The sugar market trend remained tight yesterday. The spot price for middle-grade white granulated sugar was firmer in the morning, initially at 71,000 yuan, with a few sales seen at a price of 74,500 yuan, before slightly easing back to 72,000 yuan to 70,500 yuan, and finally to 69,000 yuan to 70,000 yuan. In the afternoon, it was flat, trading at 69,000 yuan to 68,000 yuan. Retail prices from merchants were 71,200 yuan for middle-grade white granulated sugar, 90,000 yuan to 88,000 yuan for 24-grade coarse granulated sugar, 95,000 yuan for four-and-a-half jun [military] white sugar, 72,300 yuan for three-and-a-half jun white sugar, and 51,200 yuan for Numbered Goods Qing Sugar and 50,000 yuan for Shizhi. A check of the goods sold at auction the day before showed that only 1,500 bags of raw sugar were sold at 56,000 yuan, and over 500 bags of second-grade three-and-a-half cart white sugar at 61,000 yuan.</p>
<p>After the victory, all of the sugar stored in Taiwan Province was taken over by the government and sealed in warehouses in large quantities. Currently, transportation is very difficult due to a severe shortage of transportation equipment. As it stands, it would take more than a year to ship everything out. Chief Chen is very concerned and has ordered all relevant parties to expedite the process and ship 10,000 tons to Shanghai by the 15th of this month.</p>
<h3>New Zhejiang Harvest on the Market; Prices Do Not Cover Costs</h3>
<p>The purchasing of spring cocoons of local varieties in Zhejiang, Pingning, Yuhang and other places began on the 12th, with an opening price of 80,000 yuan per dan. Because silkworm farmers did not bring much merchandise, both silkworm companies raised the purchase price to 100,000 yuan, but transactions remained sparse. The conversion rate of local spring cocoons in that area is 300 catties of fresh cocoons to 100 catties of dried cocoons, and the conversion rate of dried cocoons to reeled silk is slightly less than 550 catties per dan. Jiaxing is scheduled to open scales on the 20th, and Wuxi will open scales on June 1 or 2. Suzhou is scheduled to open scales on the 28th. All of the above areas have improved varieties, and it is difficult to determine the purchase price based on the silkworm farmers' ideals, because this year the selling price of mulberry leaves has been as high as 60,000 yuan per dan, resulting in very high production costs.</p>
<p>Also reported, after the 20 billion yuan loan for silk cocoons in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui began to be issued, the amount that has been issued so far is 2 billion yuan in the eastern Zhejiang area. According to a representative of the loan syndicate, the spring cocoon industry in eastern Zhejiang has already started, so the loans were issued in advance. The Jiangnan area will have to wait until the 27th or 28th of this month to start, so the loan period is relatively long. It is estimated that the 20 billion yuan loan can purchase about 240,000 dan of wet cocoons and 80,000 dan of dry cocoons.</p>
<h3>China Farmers Bank Loans 500 Million Yuan to Purchase Hangzhou Tea; Foreign Firms Scouring for Green Tea for Export</h3>
<p>According to a responsible person from the Tea Merchant Trade Association, in order to jointly purchase Hangzhou tea, a discussion meeting was held a few days ago. In addition to discussing purchasing strategies, Wu Chang, Dadechang, Zhenzhong, Zhenxing, Great China, and Tongtaixiang, and seven other companies were designated as representatives to consult with the authorities on loans. Approval has now been obtained, and the China Farmers Bank will lend 500 million yuan. Li Naichang and Huang Yantang have also been appointed as joint purchasing directors, and it is expected that personnel will be sent to Hangzhou within days to engage in purchasing.</p>
<p>Europe and Africa currently have a very strong demand for Chinese tea, but due to various reasons, sales have not been smooth. It is learned that starting in June, foreign authorities may issue special import permits for Chinese tea. Therefore, foreign tea exporters in the Japanese market have been taking action to prepare for this eventuality. Recently, Jardine Matheson and Wu Chang and Yilong companies have purchased no less than 2,000 boxes of export green tea such as Needle Eyebrow and Special Contribution. The market atmosphere is also more active and colorful than last week. The former was traded at 35,000 to 36,000 yuan per dan, while the latter was at 36,000 to 37,000 yuan, and the market prices have risen by more than 2,000 to 3,000 yuan. As for domestic sales, merchants from Tianjin and Nanjing are continuing to be very active in the producing areas for Hangzhou new Banner Spear tea. The new Wenquan Longjing tea has arrived in large quantities, but its quality is inferior, and the market continues to trend downwards. The supply and demand for old tea varieties are equal, and the situation is difficult to change.</p>
<h3>American Fruit Arrives in Large Quantities</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Famous American fruits such as Golden Mountain apples, oranges, and lemons have been abundant in the market lately, and the supply continues to be uninterrupted. The President Cleveland, managed by the American President Lines, arrived in Shanghai yesterday from San Francisco, carrying a large shipment of fruits, with more than 40,000 pieces. The ship also carried more than 10,000 bags of cement and more than 3,000 tons of goods.</p>
<h3>Silk is Weak</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the silk market was weak again, but factory agents held onto the original price. Lian Na Company's purchase price for 83-count high uniformity yarn was 2.6 million yuan per dan. The price of user silk warp crepe was 1.7 million to 1.75 million yuan. 120-count Tianqiao bright rayon opened at 1.36 million yuan, and the closing price was 1.37 million yuan, with trading at 1.38 million yuan in the afternoon. The fluctuation throughout the day was minimal, and the result was 20,000 yuan shorter than the previous day. The price of 75-count Golden Rooster semi-dull silk fell because good prices have been seen in the market for several days, and yesterday, there was a sudden oversupply, with the price falling 60,000 yuan compared to the previous day. American Asia bedspreads were down a small amount, approximately 20,000 yuan per hundred, and Da Cheng's crepe was down a small amount, approximately 130 yuan per yard.</p>
<h3>American Industrial Recovery Makes Good Initial Progress</h3>
<p>[Dispatch from the U.S. Information Service, Washington, 13th] According to statistics from the U.S. Department of Commerce, although American industry has successfully passed the first phase of recovery, this gain is in danger of being erased by price inflation and speculation. The post-war decline in production, manufacturing, and employment has now been completely reversed. However, the government must maintain prices to preserve a sound price structure. If the government fails to do so, a severe depression will follow a period of prosperity. Although American industry faces many difficulties (such as labor disputes), the production of civilian goods has increased.</p>
<h3>500,000 Tons of Rice From Java to be Sent to India</h3>
<p>Reuters, Batavia, 14th: Indonesian Prime Minister Sjahrir previously wrote to India's Nehru offering to send 500,000 tons of Java rice to India. Nehru has replied accepting the offer. Sjahrir reiterated yesterday that he would not go back on his word and asked India to send responsible representatives to Java as soon as possible to discuss barter trade issues. If India cannot supply textiles, agricultural tools, or other items needed by Java, an exchange with foreign exchange or other items would also be acceptable.</p>
<h3>British Rayon Production Increases</h3>
<p>British Information Services, London, 14th: Rayon production in the United Kingdom in March of this year reached 15.6 million pounds, the highest monthly production since July 1940, exceeding the 1939 average by 3 percent. On a daily production basis, March production was 5 percent higher than February and 19 percent higher than March 1945. The production of woolen yarn has reached a new level, totaling 6.4 million pounds.</p>
<h3>Rice Market Prank; Briefly Rested the Day Before Yesterday, but Moved Forward Vigorously Again Yesterday</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the rice market still had supply, but sales were active and digestion was flexible. The rice market suddenly surged, with the opening price for top-grade white glutinous rice immediately calling for 48,000 yuan to 49,000 yuan. Buyers flocked in and transactions were brisk, and continued to rise, soon breaking through the 50,000 yuan mark. Although the Bean and Rice Trade Association dumped goods arriving at the warehouse on the market, it was of no avail. The closing price for white glutinous rice was as high as 51,500 yuan, and top-grade thin indica rice rose to 52,000 yuan, with the average market price rising by approximately 3,500 yuan compared to the previous day. Flour was also affected by the rising rice prices, and sentiment trended higher, rising by 400 to 500 yuan. Supply and demand for soybeans were not strong, but sellers were very firm and also raised prices by 500 to 600 yuan. Soybean cakes were strong in the morning and weak in the afternoon, rising slightly by 100 yuan. Bran sales were sluggish, peanut kernels remained mediocre, and corn from Qingdao was not actively purchased, and the market was stable. Incoming and outgoing shipments in Shantou were balanced, raw soybean oil temporarily lacked growth or decline, but refined rapeseed oil was scarce and showed strength, with prices rising by more than 1,000 yuan. According to the rice market, the total amount of rice arriving in the city yesterday was more than 4,000 dan, and the types and quantities are as follows: White glutinous rice 1,875 shi, thin indica rice 699 shi, early indica rice 845 shi, Yangxian 130 shi, Duxian 530 shi, Wuyu 179 shi, Baiyuan 30 shi, Yinyuan 10 shi</p>
<p>Also reported, the rice supply in this city is very sufficient. Not counting private individuals and various factories, rice merchants have 800,000 shi of rice in storage, according to reports and investigations by the Rice Trade Association and relevant parties, and thick glutinous rice and thin indica rice from Changshu, Suzhou, Kunshan, and Songjiang areas are constantly arriving, which is sufficient to supply demand. The reason for the rice price fluctuations this time is entirely due to the "kicking rice ball" or buying and selling among rice merchants.</p>
<h3>China Silk and China Textile Establish Contact; Silkworm Farmers Use Sales Proceeds to Purchase China Textile Cloth as Much as Possible</h3>
<p>In order to comply with President Song's instructions that the funds from this spring silkworm loan be used to guide silkworm farmers' funds back to the right track and eliminate undesirable spending, China Silk Company has established contact with China Textile Company to encourage silkworm farmers to use their sales proceeds to purchase China Textile cloth as much as possible. After several discussions between the two parties, a general agreement has been reached, and the details are as follows: (1) China Textile will first deliver an equal amount of cloth to the cocoon purchasing offices of China Silk in Hangzhou, Huzhou, Jiaxing, Suzhou, Wuxi, and Changzhou, and these six offices will be responsible for receiving, storing, and selling the cloth. (2) China Textile will send sales supervisors to the above six offices to preside over pricing matters. (3) Prices will be generally reduced by 10 to 20 percent according to local conditions. (4) Silkworm farmers will purchase cloth with their silkworm sales certificates, based on the quantity of cocoons sold. (5) All proceeds from the sale of cloth will be handed over to the bank designated by China Textile.</p>
<h3>The United States Must Import Raw Materials to Maintain Production Efficiency</h3>
<p>[Dispatch from the U.S. Information Service, Washington, 13th] According to Paul, director of the U.S. International Trade Bureau, the United States must import a large amount of goods to supplement its own production and maintain manufacturing efficiency. The United States must rely on foreign imports for many important materials. For example, for automobiles, although steel and glass are produced in the United States, the mohair used by Detroit automakers comes from Algeria, leather from Argentina, goat wool from Asia Minor, tin and rubber from Borneo or Manila, shellac sheets from India, and tin ore from China. Statistics show that 300 types of raw materials from 75 different countries are needed to manufacture a car. Paul said that U.S. imports are the main way for countries to obtain U.S. dollars to purchase U.S. goods, and in fact, each country produces a part of the goods that the United States needs. Paul said that in order for the international trade organization to work smoothly, countries must find ways to reduce and eventually remove trade barriers, including excessive tax rates and economic barriers, which can become political and social barriers and result in unnecessary animosity between countries.</p>
<h3>North China Export Goods, Pig Bristles are More Promising</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Tianjin, 14th] The U.S. government-sponsored "Foreign Commerce Weekly" discusses the current state of trade in North China, stating that since the Japanese surrender, virtually no wool has arrived in Tianjin because railway traffic to Tianjin and Shandong, Inner Mongolia, and western China has continued to be cut off. It is expected that the small amount of wool that may arrive in 1946 will only be enough to supply local needs, and no wool will be available for export for a considerable period of time. In 1936, Tianjin exported 25 million pounds of wool to the United States. In addition, no surplus cotton will be available for export in the next six or nine months. The 1945-46 cotton harvest is estimated to be about 500,000 dan, only a quarter of what local spinning mills need. The pig bristle industry was the least affected by Japanese interference, and the exportable quantity is estimated at 10,000 to 15,000 boxes. Tianjin's leather goods production is large, but goat skin inventory is low and there is no hope of exporting it. Tianjin's [illegible] carpet industry faces many difficulties due to scattered workers, lack of raw materials, and damaged machinery. The report concludes that Tianjin's purchasing power for foreign goods has been reduced due to its weak export capacity, and the hope of recovering imports is also very dim.</p>

<h3>The Enigmatic Rice Relief Problem: Guangzhou Rice Prices Breach the 100,000 Mark</h3>
<p>— Guangzhou Airmail from our Newspaper on the 11th, Special Correspondent Liang Feng</p>
<p>No one can deny that war brings poverty, disease, and hunger, and the demon of hunger is truly more cruel than anything else. Now, the giant hand of this demon of hunger is gripping the entire city of Guangzhou, threatening millions of citizens with starvation.</p>
<p>Bamboo Shoots and Flowers Used as Food</p>
<p>The food shortage in Guangzhou did not begin today, but the current high rice prices probably exceed those in the entire country. From the 20th of last month to the 2nd of this month, the price soared from over 40,000 yuan per dan (unit of weight) to over 100,000 yuan. As a result, people are in a state of panic, society is uneasy, and a terrifying scene has been created. Not only can the working masses not make a living, but even middle and upper-class families find it difficult to maintain their standard of living. Although they have not yet reached the point of eating grass roots and bark, many people have already taken to eating bamboo shoots and flowers to satisfy their hunger. Fifty to sixty people die of starvation on the streets every day. Those who are stronger struggle for survival, often robbing passersby of the food they carry. The owners of rice shops and food shops are constantly guarding against a group of "hungry thugs." Newspapers have also published a shocking piece of news: "At the beginning of this month, the Communists sent people with heavy funds to buy large quantities of grain in the four rural districts and the Shaqi Rice Market, secretly transporting it to various places for hoarding in order to stimulate grain prices. The conspiracy is to wait until the rice price rises to less than two liang (unit of weight) for every hundred yuan, and then mobilize the city's vagrants and beggars, organizing rice and food grabbing gangs in an attempt to create terror and disrupt social order..." Therefore, on "May Fourth" Day, when students commemorated the "May Fourth Movement" with a parade, when the procession passed Huiai Road, the rice shop owners, who were on edge, closed their doors uniformly. Only after they learned that it was a student parade did they return to normal. This also shows the severity of the panic here.</p>
<p>Monday, Change to Eating Coarse Grains</p>
<p>Regarding the food shortage problem, the authorities can be said to have paid considerable attention long ago. They also launched an anti-drought and disaster relief campaign and promoted a food conservation campaign, requiring all sectors of the city to eat coarse grains every Monday. However, all of these passive measures failed to curb the rise in rice prices. Therefore, the provincial government's industrial company, together with the provincial and municipal chambers of commerce and the grain guild, organized the so-called "Joint Grain Business," planning to purchase rice from neighboring provinces and various counties in this province to bring back to the city to provide relief. On April 25, they began to implement grain control, establishing a grain market, requiring all grain merchants in the city to concentrate their transactions in this market, with personnel from the Land and Food Office and the Social Bureau guiding them to prevent unscrupulous merchants from manipulating the market and stabilize the grain situation. The intention was originally the best, but after the "joint business" and "grain market" were opened, not only did the rice price not fall, but it actually soared, reaching a new record of a jump of 30,000 to 40,000 yuan per zu (a unit of weight) in three days. As a result, the problem became more and more serious. If this continues, it is really unknown what the outcome will be, and social order will be impossible to maintain.</p>
<p>Three-Level Jump, Unable to Restrain</p>
<p>The party, government, and military authorities all felt a headache for this problem. They convened emergency meetings of relevant agencies every day to discuss ways to regulate food and stabilize rice prices. Chairman Luo and the provincial party headquarters telegraphed the central government for relief one after another. The military headquarters tried its best to reduce military grain (since the repatriation of Japanese prisoners, Japanese residents, and Korean residents and the transfer of a portion of the National Army, the amount has been reduced from 130,000 large packages to 65,000 large packages). They also ordered that troops be strictly prohibited from purchasing military grain directly to avoid stimulating grain prices. The provincial government also posted notices and published in newspapers, quoting the national government's "Provisional Regulations on Punishing Violations of Food Administration in Times of Emergency," stating that those who hoard food, engage in speculation, manipulate the market, drive up grain prices, disrupt the market, and harm people's livelihoods will be severely punished... The National Assembly representatives in Guangdong are also holding meetings every day to discuss disaster relief and have appointed Lin Yizhong, Lu Yougang, Wu Zhimei, and Hu Muzha, among other four representatives, and Xiao Ciyi, director of the Land and Food Office, to go to Beijing to appeal for help. The Guangzhou News Reporters Association also holds meetings every day to discuss how to help the government solve the food shortage problem. However, one meeting today and another meeting tomorrow, they are meeting every day, but still unable to restrain the "three-level jump" of rice prices!</p>
<p>Siam Rice, Relieving the Poor</p>
<p>In late April, there was good news that 4,000 tons of Siam rice donated by overseas Chinese in Siam to relieve the food shortage in this province had arrived in Guangzhou. Of these 4,000 tons of Siam rice, 2,000 tons were shipped to Shantou, 500 tons were shipped to Hainan Island, and 1,500 tons were distributed in Guangzhou to relieve the extremely poor citizens. For this batch of rice, a relief distribution committee was organized, preparing 100,000 rice tickets to be issued to extremely poor and unemployed poor citizens. Starting from May 1, each person could receive 18 catties (unit of weight) of Siam rice with a ticket. When this news came, the poor citizens naturally cheered. In principle, with this 1,500 tons of rice adjusting the market, the rice price should fall, but the opposite happened. Not only did the arrival of this batch of Siam rice have no impact on suppressing the rice price, but the day the distribution began was the time when the rice price soared. On May 2, it broke through the 100,000 mark. Isn't this strange?</p>
<p>Coarse Broken Rice, Suspicious</p>
<p>Originally, in late April, newspapers were reporting the news of Siam rice aiding Guangdong every day, but the rice price was rising every day, which was already a bit baffling. Later, another piece of news spread (before the matter is verified, it can be said to be a rumor) that someone sold this batch of Siam rice in Hong Kong, and now they need to purchase 1,500 tons of local rice in this city for distribution, so the rice price soared because of their purchase. At the same time, there are now six or seven types of rice being distributed, some good and some bad. The bad ones are not just coarse rice and broken rice, but also contain a lot of rice bran. It is said that this kind of rice simply cannot be cooked into rice. From this point of view, it seems that everyone believes that the news of selling the Siam rice and purchasing various types of rice locally to fill the gap is a fact. Is the rice being distributed Siam rice after all? Everyone is suspicious.</p>
<p>Guangdong Branch Office, Target of Public Criticism</p>
<p>As a result, almost the entire food shortage problem has been focused on the Siam rice problem. The joint party, government, and military meeting even organized an investigation team to thoroughly investigate the situation of the relief rice being resold in Hong Kong. This batch of rice was issued by the Guangdong Branch Office of the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration. The Guangdong Branch Office has been criticized by the public in the past for its ineffective relief efforts, and this time they are responsible again, so the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration Branch Office has become the "target of public criticism."</p>
<p>On May 8, the reception for all sectors of the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration Review Committee was held in the conference hall of the military headquarters, chaired by General Zhang Fakui, the director of the military headquarters, because he is the chairman of the Review Committee. However, he first stated that although he is the chairman of the Review Committee, the actual relief work is handled by the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration Branch Office. So the main character of the day was still Mr. Ling Daoyang, the director of the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration Branch Office. After he reported on the work of the Branch Office for a while, everyone's questions were fired off like guns. Everyone was shouting: "Where did the Siam rice go?" "Is the rice being distributed now Siam rice after all?" National Assembly representative Li Dexuan even brought five small bags of five different types of rice being distributed to everyone for research. However, Director Ling's reply was: In addition to the Guangdong Branch Office, there are four other agencies directly under the "General Administration" responsible for relief in Guangdong, namely the Kowloon Storage and Transportation Bureau, the Guangzhou Storage and Transportation Office, the Purchasing and Sales Office, and the Highway Transportation Office. This time, the Siam rice was completely handed over to the Guangzhou Storage and Transportation Office directly by the Kowloon Storage and Transportation Bureau. Because they do not belong to the same system of jurisdiction, he has no way to intervene. This is obviously completely pushing off the responsibility.</p>
<p>Director Ma, Heavily Questioned</p>
<p>As a result, everyone's attention turned to the Guangzhou Storage and Transportation Office. However, that day, the director of the office, Ma, intentionally hid himself. Luo Yiqun, a member of the Central Committee, proposed: "Call Director Ma to come immediately!" Senators Zhang Liangxiu and Guan Yi even whispered "detain him," and the atmosphere became more and more tense. Finally, Director Ma arrived after being summoned, and everyone raised serious questions again. Director Ma firmly denied that there was any resale of Siam rice in Hong Kong. By that time, it was already late, but a definite answer was still not obtained. This answer probably depends on the report of the joint investigation team of the party, government, and military meeting. I believe that one day the truth will come out.</p>
<p>Regarding the matter of corruption in Siam rice, it is of course not without reason. But if, after a thorough investigation in the future, it is determined that there is no corruption in Siam rice, then why is the rice price soaring like this? There must be other reasons at play!</p>
<p>Timely Rain, Grain Prices Slightly Recover</p>
<p>When the truth about the Siam rice corruption is not clear, we will not talk about it for the time being, but regarding the formation of the soaring rice price in this city, the reporter has investigated from all sides. According to those familiar with the rice market, there are also the following factors: (1) This province's counties suffered severe drought in the spring, and the amount of stored grain is decreasing day by day. Demand exceeds supply, and grain merchants and wealthy households compete to purchase, which stimulates grain prices. (2) Not only is this province lacking grain, but other provinces also feel the lack of grain, and there is no way to provide relief. (3) The government has no grain in hand and only talks about control. The implementation is not done properly. For example, the prices in the grain market are either too high compared to the market situation, or the public prices are too low, causing less and less rice from various rivers and valleys to come to the province. (4) Although military grain has been reduced, all of it is purchased on the market. Taking military food into consideration, there is no way to stabilize civilian grain. (5) There are more than a hundred grain shops in this city that specialize in grain, and they all live within their means, maintaining their original inventory and not releasing it to regulate the market, which is no different from hoarding. (6) A large portion of the funds of grain merchants are involved in speculation, which has created a huge wave, affecting the psychology of the masses. Those who have grain are holding on to it, and those who don't have grain are competing to buy it, which makes the market's grain situation even more panic and chaotic. In addition to these six reasons, some people also say that many bureaucratic capitalists are involved in manipulating grain prices this time. Of course, we hope that this is just a guess, or a rumor.</p>
<p>Although, in the past two days, timely rain has suddenly fallen, the drought is expected to be eliminated, and grain prices have also begun to fall, now hovering between 60,000 and 70,000 yuan. However, the shadow of grain price fluctuations seems to still exist, and we can only hope that the wise authorities will handle it properly.</p>
<h3>Political Changes in Hunan Province: The New and Old Chairmen Have Different Styles; Wang Dongyuan Came to Rescue from Disaster</h3>
<p>— Changsha Airmail from our Newspaper on the 5th, Special Correspondent Gao Yuanli</p>
<p>The reorganization of the Hunan Provincial Government, which had been in the works for nearly two months, was not officially announced by the Executive Yuan until the middle of last month. Wang Dongyuan, Chairman of the Hubei Provincial Government, was transferred to Hunan. Soon after, the directors and members of various departments were also changed one after another. Only Wang Fengjie, the director of the Education Department, remained in office. The new provincial government lineup is neat and tidy, and the people of Hunan are refreshed. Undoubtedly, it has received good reviews from all parties, considering it the soundest provincial government in the restoration period.</p>
<p>Former Chairman Wu Qiwai was appointed in a time of crisis, establishing the provincial government in Yuanling, the wartime capital of the province. Everyone knew that this stage was extremely difficult. The original provincial government was far away in Lanshan and Jiahe, and there was no way to take over. Even the seals of the provincial government and various departments were not available. It was extremely inconvenient for Chairman Wu to issue orders in Yuanling, and the organization was not sound. Everything can be said to be makeshift. However, facing the military operations to cooperate with the counter-offensive, the responsibility was extremely heavy. Fortunately, it did not last long. The enemy surrendered, and the Yuanling Provincial Government and the Provincial Government in southern Hunan moved back to Changsha to merge, and the organization was finally completed. However, the work of restoration followed closely, and there were thousands of threads that needed to be handled with extreme caution. Mr. Wu is known as a nice guy. Although his style of doing things is not very proactive, it is not considered very passive either. The people of Hunan are self-reliant in this neither proactive nor passive state. To put it calmly, everyone is doing well. However, the frequent disasters and the soaring grain prices forced the provincial government to reorganize in order to cope with this extraordinary situation. The initial rumor was that there would be a partial reorganization, and Secretary-General Liu Xuhui would be promoted to a higher position. However, not long after the official announcement of Mr. Liu's appointment as a member of the provincial government, there was a rumor of a full-scale reorganization, but it was always just a rumor. When Chairman Wu returned to Changsha after attending the Second Plenary Session of the Central Committee, the news of the reorganization subsided for a while, but it was officially revealed soon after.</p>
<p>(1) An Episode</p>
<p>Just after the government officially announced the reorganization, before the new officials arrived, a bizarre incident occurred in Changsha, namely a sudden increase in rice prices. In a period of five days, the price of rice soared from 28,000 yuan per shi (unit of weight) to 53,000 yuan. At that time, most of the newspapers in Changsha almost unanimously said that so-called "special power figures" were searching for 50,000 shi of grain in Changsha to transport south. At that time, the rice price in Hengyang, Qiyang, and Lingling was 70,000 yuan, and the rice price in Guangdong was 60,000 yuan per 100 catties (unit of weight). Each shi of Hunan rice sent to Guangdong could make a net profit of 50 catties of rice. This number is quite large. The editorials, features, news, and even supplements of the newspapers all took this as the subject, criticizing and describing it, and saying that the brother of a certain important person was responsible for the search, but they never clearly stated who the so-called "special power figures" were. The official response was only that Chairman Wu ordered the relevant agencies to investigate and severely punish the so-called manipulators, but the agencies, as usual, forwarded the order without any response. This matter continued until the day the new chairman took office, and then it disappeared without a trace. This is an episode during the transition between the old and new.</p>
<p>(2) Hunan Obtains the Right Person</p>
<p>The people of Hunan are most familiar with the new chairman, Wang Dongyuan. Wang is from Anhui, but almost all of his career has been built in Hunan, from being a battalion commander to a division commander, all in Hunan. Moreover, his wife is also from Hunan. When the order for him to govern Hunan was sent to Changsha, everyone said that it was better to have half a Hunan person govern Hunan. He originally belonged to the Fourth Route Army Headquarters, so his former comrades and old subordinates were celebrating and reliving the old dreams of the past. But times are progressing, and politics is especially progressing. And Mr. Wang Dongyuan has made great progress in the past few years as the director of the wartime training center.</p>
<p>Mr. Wang arrived on April 26 and took office on April 27. As soon as he got off the bus, he said that he "came to rescue from disaster." He told the news media that the disaster in Hunan was more severe than any other province. Linxiang and Yueyang were places where he used to be stationed. He said that when he passed through Linxiang and Yueyang this time, he simply couldn't recognize them. They were completely destroyed. Coming to Hunan feels like coming home. This home really needs to be rebuilt. When he talked about disaster relief, he advocated "launching large-scale work relief," but he did not give specific measures. He said that he would contact the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration to strive for supplies to overcome the difficulties. He also said that various relief efforts were too late due to various reasons, so he advocated a policy of "self-help and mutual help." This policy was implemented in Henan in the past and was effective, that is, the county, township, pao (administrative division), and chia (smallest unit of administrative division) levels are responsible. Which chia has victims, that chia is responsible for relief. Which pao has a disaster, that pao is responsible for relief. The township is responsible for the township, and the county is responsible for the county. This can be done quickly and accurately, and it is better than government relief.</p>
<p>(3) Key Politics</p>
<p>When reading the policy guidelines, Mr. Wang emphasized "key politics." He said that he did not have the extravagant hope of "everything being revived," but only wanted to accomplish one thing at a time, accumulating bit by bit to achieve practical results. This announcement received the sympathy of many people, but how to actually do it could only wait for the next steps.</p>
<p>The long-awaited rain also came with Chairman Wang's special car. As soon as Chairman Wang got off the train, it started to rain. In Hunan society, where feudal ideas have not been completely eradicated, it did arouse great excitement among the people. However, the heavy rain has continued for days, the river has risen sharply, mountain torrents have broken out, and highways and railways have been blocked. The streets along the river in Changsha are also flooding. It would be bad if it turns into a flood. The food shortage is already tight, and a flood would make Hunan even worse. After the heavy rain, grain prices have eased slightly, and people can breathe a little.</p>
<p>Chairman Wang announced that he came to rescue from disaster, so he scheduled to go to the disaster areas in southern Hunan with Liu Xuru, the director of the Social Affairs Department, and Yao Xuehuai, the deputy director of the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, in two days to inspect the disaster. However, due to the blockage of highways and railways by the water, it has not been possible to go. It is feared that Mr. Hoover's trip to Hunan to inspect the disaster will also be suspended due to the weather.</p>
<p>(4) A Mistake of One Word</p>
<p>Finally, I would like to report a small episode in the reorganization of the Hunan Provincial Government: In this reorganization of the provincial government, Li Yuyiao, the original member of the provincial government and director of the Construction Department, was dismissed. The vacancy was filled by Li Yujiu, the former mayor of Changsha. It is unknown for what reason, but the newspapers in Changsha, Hankou, and Shanghai all mistook the word "jiu" (九, nine) for "yao" (堯, Yao). As a result, letters and telegrams were sent from all over to Li Yuxiao congratulating him on his re-election. It was not until Chairman Wang came to Changsha and forwarded the government order that the matter was clarified, almost causing a joke. In fact, Li Yujiu and Li Yuyiao are different people, not brothers.</p>
<h3>Drooping Heads, Ash-Colored Faces: Traitorous Jin Villains Paraded Through the Streets</h3>
<p>— Taiyuan Correspondence on the 6th, from Zhongji</p>
<p>The Military Intelligence Bureau arrested 55 Chinese traitors in the Shanxi area, including the pseudo-provincial governor Su Tiren. Except for Su Tiren and a certain Mr. Jiang (grandson of Jiang Shuhai), the former pseudo-Yanmen Dao (administrative division) governor, the investigations of the rest have been completed and they were handed over to the court yesterday.</p>
<p>At 8:45, escort officers Sun Yixian and Hu Jinbo, accompanied by many police and military officers, went to the temporary detention center in Nanxiaochang to collect them. Among them, Chen Qinshan, Zhang Erji, Lu Yuting, Guo Yi, Zhou Bing, Fan Rongying, Liu Xiang, Chang Jinnjiu, and Mai Zhenhai were released later for various reasons. The remaining 47 people, including the rebellious Feng Sizhi, after being handcuffed and called by name, were divided into five heavy-duty vehicles, each marked with the names of the traitors, and escorted out simultaneously under strict guard. In order to show the public the giant traitors, the vehicles went slowly around the bustling streets of Bingyuan, passing through Hongshi Street, Qiaotou Street, Zhonglou Street, Ansi Street, and Maoer Lane. The masses, hearing the news, all wanted to see the true faces of the giant traitors who had served as tigers for the enemy in the past. Therefore, there were crowds of people everywhere. Those who were indignant could not help but shout for the elimination of traitors, and the crowd echoed, their voices shaking the sky. Many people also applauded along with them. The traitors all showed embarrassment, drooping their heads, and some had ash-colored faces. When they arrived at the High Court, there were no less than several thousand spectators on the way, blocking the road. Chief Prosecutor Hao Yuzong and others called their names and accepted the case. At 9:40, the interrogation began, four people per batch. The interrogation was completed at 10:00, and they were escorted back to the vehicles and sent to the Provincial First Prison, where Warden Meng Yucai called their names, verified their fingerprints, and divided them into cells. Each traitor occupied a single room, waiting for the formal trial to begin.</p>
<p>The Evil Deeds of Three Traitors</p>
<p>Among the 47 traitors, Feng Sizhi and Wang Xiang were the most important.</p>
<p>(1) The Rebellious Feng, from Pingding, Shanxi, had talent in his youth, was good at flattery, and was very muddled-headed in matters. Before the incident, he had served as the chairman of the Shanxi Provincial Education Association and the director of the Education Department. After the incident, the rebellious Feng also retreated with the army to Wanquan County in southern Shanxi. After living there for more than a year, he returned to Bing and surrendered to the enemy.</p>
<p>(2) The Rebellious Wang Xiang, from Shouyang County, Shanxi, had a good reputation for running the Provincial First Middle School for many years, producing many talents. Later, he ran the Yangquan Coal Mine, and his performance was quite good. In the 20th year of the Republic of China, he was selected and recommended by the Meng-Jin authorities as the director of the Construction Department, and he enjoyed a great reputation for a time. Later, he was transferred to the manager of the Shanxi Provincial Bank. After Taiyuan fell to the enemy, he moved to Xi'an several times. In the 28th year, the rebel returned to Qiulin Town, Yichuan County, Shaanxi, to temporarily serve in the Second War Zone Headquarters. After leaving, he turned to Hong Kong to take care of his family's affairs during the war. After Hong Kong fell, he returned to Bing and joined the enemy.</p>
<p>(3) Ma Libo had been mixing in the news media for many years. He was straightforward, quite literate, and used Yema as his pen name. On the eve of the fall of Taiyuan, the reporter met him in Liuxiang, encouraging each other to resist the enemy. He still boasted, "I am old but my ambition does not wane. Watch what the old horse is going to do." He had organized a militia to resist the enemy in Jishan. How long had it been before he entered the city and joined the enemy? Today, he finally became a prisoner, ridiculed by everyone!</p>
<h3>A Ladleful from the Huan River</h3>
<p>— A Zhuji Dispatch, the 5th, from Fei Village</p>
<p>When I first arrived in this mountain city, Zhuji's appearance was extremely tattered and unsightly. During the war, it fell three times, each time the enemy invaded, bombed, burned, killed, and destroyed. Each time the enemy retreated under the force of our people's armed strength, it was again bombing, burning, killing, and destruction. Victory came, and just after taking over, looking only at the buildings in the urban area, out of a hundred houses, no more than three or four remained, and even the few that remained were not intact. In the countryside, the situation was also very desolate. It is said that entire villages were burned to the ground, a desolate white expanse. These scars left by the aftermath of the catastrophe starkly displayed the legacy of the enemy's invasion of Zhuji. Living in this desolate and ruined mountain city, I felt that the shadow of war was still following us closely.</p>
<p>The people of Zhuji are known for their "strong and unyielding character." Naturally, in the past, they had dedicated countless flesh and blood, tears and sweat to the resistance against Japan. The stories of those who worked hard and sacrificed for the liberation of their homeland are still talked about with relish among the people. Here, I do not want to introduce them, but only to make an objective sketch of Zhuji today.</p>
<p>The Dust and Wind of Yue Women</p>
<p>After spring arrived, the people here seemed to have gained a bit of vitality. Due to the devastation of housing, construction was underway everywhere in the cities and villages, building new houses. However, the houses that were being built mostly maintained a "wartime" style, and the quality of materials and construction was incomparable to the meticulous standards of pre-war times. Ruins have begun to be cleared, and new houses are increasing day by day. In just over two months, the mountain city has surprisingly changed its appearance. Shops have increased, and the roads have been widened. Now, in the small town, one can even hear the sound of phonographs. A department store recently had a "sale" and hired a band to play music, adding a bit of bustle. However, the mountain city is still too desolate, and those sounds and decorations always make people feel lonely!</p>
<p>The busiest place is not in the central urban area, but in the area around the North Gate. It is close to the train station, and most of the cars also stop there. As a result, so-called merchants gather and travelers flock there, creating the prosperity of the North Gate area today. It seems that there are no "public prostitutes" here, but private prostitutes have become active. They are slowly equipping and adding everything that meets the needs of those travelers and merchants.</p>
<p>According to some people's estimates, the prosperity of the Zhuji urban area will have a period of strong growth in the future, because the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway has not yet been fully connected. But I think: The future status of Zhuji on the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, due to its proximity to the provincial capital (Hangzhou), will probably not be inferior to that of Jinhua and Lanxi, right?</p>
<p>A Ghastly Picture</p>
<p>Along with the spring light, the dark shadow of famine has covered this land after the catastrophe. When spring training began, it rained for thirty or forty days straight, and some crops were severely damaged. Then came the epidemic, and barley and wheat were followed by an epidemic disease. It is feared that there will not be a good harvest this spring. This year is the first year after the war, and the people regard food as their heaven. Food supply threatens people first. Recently, the price of rice has jumped past the 30,000 mark, catching up with the areas around Shanghai and Hangzhou.</p>
<p>Most of the people are so poor that they are about to lose even the right to smell the aroma of rice. Although relief flour has been distributed once, what use is five catties? To save a dying life, just thinking of "tomorrow" makes one tremble all over! Moreover, the allocated "funds" and "rice" are still being strictly enforced!</p>
<p>In the food shortage, elementary school teachers are the first to face the crisis. Several "central national schools" and "bao national schools" in the villages are already without rice to cook. Teachers cannot tighten their belts and teach while hungry! As a result, some have become lazy in teaching, and some have simply closed their doors. Recently, students from the Yuan Dong Township school held a petition march. Their little slogan was: "We want to study! We cannot let our teachers go hungry!"</p>
<p>Just like other places, it seems that a ghastly picture that one cannot bear to look at will unfold here!</p>
<h3>Tokyo Has Become Smaller: Population Reduced to Only 3.5 Million, Anything Can Be Bought as Long as You Have Money</h3>
<p>— Specially Translated by This Newspaper's Translation Office</p>
<p>Today's Tokyo is undoubtedly the smallest city in the world. The journalists living in the Tokyo Press Club, the few surviving European and American expatriates who survived the war, and even the officers and soldiers in the occupation forces, do not have any direct concern for the daily life of this city of 3.5 million people. Only two or three thousand people go in and out of social events, and they will eventually get to know each other.</p>
<p>Of course, some people pay attention to the trends in Japanese politics and economics and conduct serious observation and analysis. Moreover, every foreigner has some contact with Japanese people who speak English or French, but the Japanese way of life and various problems have a clearly different, unrealistic color in the eyes of Westerners. The most important thing that has influenced Westerners is probably the freezing of bank deposits and the conversion of old yen into new yen. This is also something they are worried about.</p>
<p>The Marunouchi Hotel, located in the heart of Tokyo, is the social center for Europeans, Americans, and Japanese. This apartment was not taken over by the US military for use as barracks. It has become a dormitory for European embassy staff (past and present) and American officers and soldiers. In addition, Japanese Foreign Ministry personnel were also allowed to set up rooms on the second and third floors. Throughout the winter, from cocktail hour (there were actually no cocktails) until after midnight, the hotel's lounge was filled with guests and visitors, discussing various plans.</p>
<p>Diplomats still have the desire to maintain their diplomatic status even when their governments no longer exist. This is especially true for the Italians. They relied on their own luck and the inscrutable minds of the Japanese to be detained there after the surrender of the Italian Badoglio government in 1944. The French, who were waiting to return home, discriminated against the Italians. The Swedes and Swiss, who were responsible for managing the affairs of foreign nationals during the war, discriminated against the French and Italians. However, the Americans adopted their traditional non-political attitude and did not discriminate against anyone.</p>
<p>Japanese Foreign Ministry personnel continued to gather in the dormitory. They were divided into two factions based on language—one that spoke English and one that spoke French. To know which faction a Japanese person belonged to, you don't need to hear them speak to know. You can determine it just by observing. The Japanese who spoke English were rude, overly sincere, and made loud, long laughs to show how well they understood the meaning of the joke. The Japanese who spoke French often draped their jackets over their shoulders like shawls in operas and wore long hair.</p>
<p>These things are all past events because most of the foreign diplomats living in Japan have returned home. However, before they returned home, a few major social events occurred that are worth mentioning here: One was the marriage of Ms. Jia Luohua, the "daughter" of the former French Consul General in Japan, to Mr. Warner, a photographer in the US Army. The other was the banquet held by the former Italian Ambassador and Ms. Yintai Li for Major General Wei Luopei. While they were feasting, a black market raiding team led by US military police suddenly broke in, interrupting the joyous celebration. As a result, several US soldiers and two former Italian air force personnel were arrested and taken away.</p>
<p>In early March, thirty Soviet representatives participating in the war crimes trials arrived in Tokyo, adding a layer of red brilliance to the international colors of the Marunouchi Hotel. Although rumors had circulated in advance that bloodshed would occur in the hotel, all the Red Army personnel and the White Russians in the hotel got along safely and no accidents occurred.</p>
<p>Tokyo's black market is one of the main bonds between the Japanese and Westerners. Six months after Japan's surrender, a pack of American cigarettes remains the standard of value. Europeans who have no relationship with the occupation forces almost completely buy goods above the official price.</p>
<p>As a Frenchman who has lived in the Far East for twenty-seven years said: "Thank God, Japan has become a completely disintegrated country. As long as you can pay, you can buy anything." (Report by Kali Hugh, special correspondent of the United Press in Tokyo on the 12th.)</p>

<p>Spring and Autumn</p>
<h3>A Painting on the Bed</h3>
<p>— Hu Shi Weak</p>
<p>For people living in Shanghai, it is extremely difficult to experience the lush greenery of mountains and rivers, especially for the majority of small office workers and those who bear the burden of living on salary income. Among this majority is also myself, and of course, there is no need to say that I want to travel to the mountains and rivers, caress the pines and seek the ravines. Even if I know that the grass and trees in the park have turned green, and I occasionally steal a moment from my busy schedule to stroll around, I am still broken by my inner thoughts. So, I can only climb onto my pigeon-cage-like bed, close my eyes, and let the green mountains, green waters, verdant cypresses, and ancient pines come to my imagination from the darkness and stuffiness.</p>
<p>But this cannot be satisfied. Human desires are originally like this, but it is better to draw a cake to satisfy hunger. So, I spent one evening rushing to complete a picture and paste it on the bed.</p>
<p>Because the only small window in the dormitory is behind the kitchen, directly opposite the kitchen window, we are very reluctant to open it. We would rather let the stifling summer fill the room, or the smell of coal, coal ash, and heat are more unbearable than the heat and stuffiness of closing the window. I have lived here for five years, and I am used to everything, but sometimes when I read articles describing the fields and mountains, I cannot help but remember my hometown and want to travel to the fields. However, this power is ultimately much lighter and smaller than the whip of life!</p>
<p>I used my memories to draw the scenery outside the window of my home in the countryside. In the old house surrounded by mountains in my hometown, I chose a building facing southeast with open windows as a study. Outside the window facing southeast was a clump of willows almost as tall as the window. Except for the white catkins that floated all over the desk in the summer, I still cherished it very much. Outside the willow tree was a stream, but it was a bit narrow. Except for the floodwaters after the heavy rain in late summer and early autumn, it was dry for six or seven tenths of the year. But I didn't care about these because further away from the stream was a full lake of clear water. Like before, I could see the ripples of the lake water and the early morning and evening activities of the people living by the lake. The lake area is very small, and the south side of the lake is a winding mountain range. The stream does not connect with the lake water. Only the impact of mountain water can flow into the stream. What I especially find lovely is the lush green beauty after the summer rain, and the water droplets accumulated on the willow leaves are illuminated by the sun and sparkle. The green and yellow fields are even more clear and beautiful after being washed. Because I always had this scenery deeply imprinted in my mind, I drew it on a white piece of paper. This is not to embellish the beauty of the bed—on this bed and in this small dormitory, dust is always present. The eight beds and the only place to leave a path to walk have already been messy beyond repair.</p>
<p>In the evening, when I put down my tired body after a day's work, I use it to relax my mind and body. If it is so hot that I can't breathe, I often look at it, as if I opened the window and saw the coolness after the midsummer rain, and a clear, fresh wind swept in through the window.</p>
<p>During this period, who among the salaried class is not living in a daze and confusion? Who wants to look further? Drawing a cake to satisfy hunger is enough to give us a little comfort.</p>
<p>Now, spring is quietly descending on the earth. Spring in Jiangnan is so charming and bright! I seem to see the mountain colors of my hometown changing from yellow and withered to banana green again. Today, on this spring rainy day, the budding branches are tender green again.</p>
<h3>Resurrection</h3>
<p>— Deng Lin</p>
<p>Hope is like a flower, it will wither, but it will also be resurrected. Life is like a small grass, it may wither silently, but it will also grow vigorously.</p>
<p>Friend! When you see a beautiful sunset and feel sad, do you think about tomorrow? Tomorrow will appear before your eyes without stinting. Leave your tears that you can cherish! Life is never-ending.</p>
<p>That morning, I asked Hua—a young friend: "What do you feel? About this era!"</p>
<p>"I feel a little boring. The surroundings are too cold!"</p>
<p>"Why? Do you want to surround yourself with some troubles?"</p>
<p>"Ah! I can't say. I'm so empty that I can't grab anything, but it's like something is blocked!"</p>
<p>Young people love to sing this old tune when their souls have some loss.</p>
<p>So, on a blank piece of paper, I wrote him these words: "The plum blossom has stretched out its buds from the thick snow to welcome the New Year, although the surroundings are equally cold."</p>
<p>Tell my friends around me: When the spring breeze sweeps through the water country, everything will be resurrected, so don't be saddened by the disillusionment of your hopes. Remember: This is an unchanging sentence, life is never-ending.</p>
<p>May it be engraved in everyone's heart.</p>
<h3>The Greatest Comfort</h3>
<p>— Zhong Yuan</p>
<p>Many vegetarian old ladies are constantly moving their prayer beads in their hands, and ceaselessly chanting "Amitabha Amitabha" in their mouths. It is said that they are accumulating wealth for themselves, but that wealth is not accumulated on earth, but in the Western Paradise. It is said that chanting the Buddha's name once deposits a sum of money in the Buddha's country, so everyone chants desperately, hoping that after death, they will ascend to the Western Paradise and enjoy a carefree life.</p>
<p>This is what the vegetarian old ladies think, and it certainly doesn't count. If the purpose of Buddhists chanting the Buddha's name is only to enjoy happiness after going to the Western Paradise, then Buddhism will become a selfish religion. However, in Christianity, there is indeed the teaching of "accumulating wealth in heaven," but the so-called "wealth" refers to "love," calling people to love friends, love neighbors, love all people in the world, and even love enemies—"love" is a property accumulated in the kingdom of heaven that will never decay!</p>
<p>Leaving religion aside, in this chaotic world, even from the secular point of view of interests, "accumulating wealth in heaven" is really not a losing thing. Today, you have plundered thousands of fortunes on earth, but you are worried day and night about thieves, robbers, extortion, and even the danger of being killed. What happiness is there to speak of? However, if you give your love to others, sometimes just a word of comfort, a smile, can be exchanged for people's eternal gratitude and eternal love!</p>
<p>What happiness in the world is greater than everyone loving you and everyone being grateful to you?</p>
<p>Men and women who are looking for happiness, put down the cumbersome gold and silver and accumulate wealth in heaven quickly!</p>
<h3>Remembering the Poet Yang Yunshi Bu</h3>
<p>— Fang Zhou</p>
<p>Reading Mr. Tang Liyan's series of articles in this column remembering the poet Yang Biaoshi, I deeply feel the sorrow of the loss of a person. Remembering when I was young, I read Mr. Yang's poems and always admired him. Later, I drifted to Shanghai, and Mr. Yang also returned south after being forged. I met him by chance while I was a guest. Although I only met him once, I felt happy in my life and made a friendship of the same year. When the War of Resistance broke out, I heard that Mr. Yang had chosen to live in Hong Kong, and he chanted about his country with sorrow. The long song he made was thousands of words long, and he was generous and impassioned, truly not less than Du Fu's Northern Expedition poems. It was enough to encourage the weak and be a moral model, and not just a poetic history! His pure and noble character is truly worthy of his former master, General Wu.</p>
<p>Mr. Yang and the famous prostitute Chen Meimei's affairs have been recorded in detail by Mr. Ke, and many lost poems have also been quoted, so that romantic stories can spread widely in the world, but there are still some things that have not been exhausted. Mr. Yang was born with a passionate nature. When Ms. Xiake died, Mr. Yang cried sadly. The poems and essays mourning his death were compiled into a special collection, which General Fu Wei signed as: "Yang Qi's Eulogy to His Wife." At that time, he was a guest in Wuhan, and his friends invited him to drink wine and watch flowers to dispel his sorrows. He became close to Meimei. It was once widely rumored that they had discussed marriage. The good thing did not come to fruition, and both wanted to commit suicide for love. Newspapers carried the story, but it was unfounded. A friend wrote to comfort him, and he replied with a poem:</p>
<p>The tiger's head has no phase to talk about marquis, how can you get an allure like Mo Chou? Still a true scholar, drunk and sleeping with Yue women watching Wu Gou.</p>
<p>Meeting with wine in the slender waist palace, half of the country is in a hundred battles. Winning the heart of a beauty who is willing to die, a scholar is not necessarily different from a hero!</p>
<p>Pity myself painting swords and cherishing singing skirts, why meet in Wuxia clouds! I am also drifting with the pink and white, a strong year serving as an envoy and an old soldier. A friend wrote a letter saying that the Wuhan tabloid was competing to publish his traces. Those who should be involved should be added. Mr. Yang wrote a playful comment at the end of the paper, saying: "The newspaper has his freedom of publication, and prostitution is my freedom of love. If you want to blame his family's newspaper, first blame me for going to the Qin Building every night! As long as it's romantic and not obscene, why bother to pursue it!" It can be seen that his mind is frank and his measure is broad, and his personality is not comparable to those who cover up their faults, steal their names and deceive the world.</p>
<h3>Feelings on Returning to the Capital</h3>
<p>— Xu Xing</p>
<p>The Han banner and the heavenly wind are competing to roll open, and the atmosphere is overflowing the clouds. The moving and peerless songs sing the praise of the head of state, and the historical sites of the past are entrusted to great scholars. There are still heads falling to the ground in shock. How can there be no tears to see the return to the capital? Please seek life and breathing from abdication and concession, and do not fail the difficult and bloody journey.</p>
<h3>On Tang Shixia's Painting</h3>
<p>— Ya Daoren</p>
<p>Mr. Tang paints like writing poetry. One hill and one ravine are not easy. The overlapping clouds and mountains are beyond the misty clouds. The corners of the vermilion buildings are arranged appropriately. This place should not be found in the human realm. How can the human world be so beautiful? I know that many painters have illusions, but only the poet's artistic conception is strange. Rice in Chang'an is expensive and the world is bland. Can you live in the painting and poetry for a while? (According to Tang Jun, he has recently been invited by the Beijing Rong Baozhai to participate in a famous painting exhibition at the Chinese Painting Garden.)</p>
<h3>Night Theater</h3>
<p>— Hong Ye</p>
<p>The night theater contains infinite life.</p>
<p>Many people are growing, acting, and dying. They walk towards the bright side; they also walk towards the dark side. They live towards the flying side; they also live towards the lingering side. Thus, one by one in joy and sorrow, in schadenfreude, they all show the true meaning of life.</p>
<p>How beautiful the night theater is!</p>
<p>A long string of years of laughter; endless days of suffering, we watch one old person die, the young grow old, and the children become adults. What remains unchanged is the dream woven by countless joys and sorrows formed by people.</p>
<p>Friend, do you need to know about life? Then go to the night theater to find it!</p>
<h3>Love in the Air-Raid Shelter</h3>
<p>— Ren Jun</p>
<p>They met in the air-raid shelter—</p>
<p>When the early summer sun began to shine on the earth,</p>
<p>When the mountain city's fog was drawn open by the hot wind,</p>
<p>When large numbers of enemy planes frequently visited.</p>
<p>Enemy bullets made countless families and fathers and sons</p>
<p>Have to temporarily separate,</p>
<p>(How many people have been evacuated to the countryside!)</p>
<p>But it also made many people turn from strangers into acquaintances,</p>
<p>From acquaintances to confidants.</p>
<p>The two of them, soon—</p>
<p>Also turned from acquaintances to lovers.</p>
<p>Love is a bit close to selfishness,</p>
<p>Love can also make people become particularly great obstacles:</p>
<p>In the beginning,</p>
<p>They even hoped that a few more alarms could be issued;</p>
<p>Because this way—</p>
<p>They could meet a few more times,</p>
<p>Talk a few more times,</p>
<p>Sit closely together a few more times,</p>
<p>Share a few more hardships together!</p>
<p>Soon—</p>
<p>Like plum blossoms blooming in the wind and snow,</p>
<p>Their love, in suffering:</p>
<p>From bud to full bloom!</p>
<p>And, on a clear autumn day,</p>
<p>After an "evil bombing,"</p>
<p>They finally ran out of the air-raid shelter,</p>
<p>And held that simple and solemn wedding ceremony.</p>
<p>Perhaps the enemy had never even thought of it—</p>
<p>Their bombs of slaughter and destruction actually turned into</p>
<p>A matchmaker for lovers to finally become husband and wife!</p>
<h3>Double Flying (35)</h3>
<p>— Zhao Qingge</p>
<p>"Brother, why don't you go to Beijing too! Mom said, there are so many, many books in Beijing for us to read." Lihua finally couldn't help but persuade Baoling this way. At the same time, she was indeed tempted by the yearning for these "books."</p>
<p>Baoling didn't say anything, just shook his head, and affectionately stroked Lihua's hair.</p>
<p>Lihua became even more puzzled. She thought in her heart, wasn't Baoling usually the most fond of reading? Why can't even books tempt him now?</p>
<p>Just like that, Lihua, in childish confusion, was brought into a new destiny of adversity by Mrs. Mo!</p>
<p>When everyone was about to part, Baoling said in a hoarse voice to Mrs. Mo:</p>
<p>"Mom! Don't worry and go! I have already found something to do! I will live with dignity!" After saying that, Baoling forced a bitter smile.</p>
<p>"Okay. However, I have already made arrangements for you. Mo Sheng will take care of you in the future."</p>
<p>Mrs. Mo cried! But, she finally hardened her heart and resolutely took Lihua and Liyun away!</p>
<p>Lihua, with red eyes, kept looking back at Baoling; looking at the house where she had grown up for eight years; looking at every plant and tree she was familiar with...</p>
<p>Only Liyun was calm; happy; because she was about to see her mother again. Moreover, she had no impression of the problems they were experiencing. She felt that changing to a new environment was good, and at the same time, in her innocent heart, as long as she was with Lihua, she would be satisfied.</p>
<p>After Baoling saw off Mrs. Mo and Lihua, and returned to this empty house, his heart was also empty! He walked into the study and sat on the grand master chair that Old Master Mo used to sit on. A burst of intense stabbing pain, like ten thousand sharp blades piercing into his chest, he helplessly lay on the desk and burst into loud cries!</p>
<p>"Dad!"</p>
<p>Mo Sheng witnessed this scene, which in his view, should have been the end of the Mo family's tragedy! He sighed, helped Baoling up, and comforted him:</p>
<p>"The old man didn't pamper you for nothing. With you staying in Jingzhou, he can smile in peace under the nine springs!"</p>
<p>Baoling, hearing these words, raised his head sadly, his tearful eyes blurring as he stared at Mo Sheng. As if discovering the soul of Old Master Mo, he dazedly lunged forward and fainted in Mo Sheng's arms!</p>

<h3>Service Briefs</h3>
<p>Free Clinic: Medical doctor of trauma, Mr. Tong Zhongyi, has sent fifty free clinic vouchers, entrusted to this column to be given to patients. The clinic is located at No. 23, Lane 124, South of Weihaiwei Road, Tongfu Road. Clinic hours are set from 9 AM to 12 PM. Seriously ill patients will be seen at any time.</p>
<p>Free Examination: To whom it may concern, our hospital has specially set up a free X-ray fluoroscopy examination for the purpose of checking for tuberculosis among poor citizens, in order to facilitate prevention and treatment. A daily quota of ten people is set. Citizens who are legitimately employed and whose families are indeed poor may obtain a certificate from their respective service organizations or Baojia chiefs to undergo a free X-ray examination at the hospital, in order to fulfill the humble intentions of serving the community. We respectfully request that you publish this in your esteemed column so that everyone may be informed. The Nanshi Public Hospital. (Address) 775 Minguo Road.</p>
<p>Clinic and Medication: To whom it may concern, I, in view of the high cost of living and the suffering of the poor and sick, with the help of friends, will provide clinics and medications from the first of this month. Those who are poor and sick and unable to afford medical expenses must ask the merchant or organization to provide a certificate as a restriction. The time is from 9 AM to 3 PM. The clinic is located at Yao Taishan Tang at the intersection of Shanxi Road and Tianjin Road. Respectfully, Chinese Medicine Practitioner Wei Liyan.</p>
<p>Lost and Found Package: At 8 PM on the eleventh of this month, I was returning home from the Minguo Daily newspaper office, waiting at the tram platform at the intersection of Nanjing Road and Shanxi Road. Suddenly, a jeep drove straight onto the platform, and my left arm, right leg, and internal organs were injured. At the time, I was unconscious. After arriving at Guangci Hospital, I woke up to see a paper-wrapped package, which belonged to someone else. I have specially entrusted a friend to send it to your esteemed publication. Please publish this in the service column to find the owner. This is from Shao Ranghuang, the injured party, as dictated from the hospital bed. (13th)</p>
<p>(Editor's note) The package handed over by Mr. Shao has the words "Please trouble Mr. Sun Kaixian to bring it back to his hometown and deliver it to Mr. Zhou Yurun of Ruicheng Qianzhuang, entrusted by Zhou Shutong." We hope Mr. Zhou can present his identification card to claim it back from this column.</p>
<h3>Answering Readers' Legal Questions</h3>
<p>Zhang Lianrun of Hangzhou asks: I have heard that in the war-stricken areas, for the fields and properties traded among the people, after the victory, according to the laws that have been established, the seller can return the original price at the time to the buyer and forcibly take back the property rights. The questioner has many doubts. The so-called buying and selling is absolutely different in nature from mortgages. How can there be a reason to forcibly take back the sold fields and properties after a considerable period of time? Therefore, it is unavoidable that this will be misinterpreted by some opportunists. Generally speaking, formal and law-abiding citizens' mutual trading of fields and properties is definitely based on the willingness of both parties. I believe that the government authorities will never have such a legal provision. This is not comparable to the general shameless traitors who used the power of the enemy and puppets to forcibly occupy civilian properties in the occupied areas, taking other people's properties as their own. It goes without saying that the original owner filing a public lawsuit after the victory will not take effect. I respectfully request your newspaper to disclose this according to the principles of law, so that those who have doubts about this matter may know the correct details.</p>
<p>[Answer by Lawyer Cao Yaxia] Formal and law-abiding citizens who mutually trade fields and properties in the wartime occupied areas and have formally completed the buying and selling procedures, shall not be considered invalid. Only (A) the land title documents issued by the enemy and puppet organizations are invalid. The transfer of land rights should be re-registered by the right holders with the competent municipal and county governments within six months after the government publicly exercises its power after the restoration. (B) If the buying and selling act at the time was taking advantage of another person's urgency, recklessness, or lack of experience, causing them to make a property payment or a promise of payment, which, according to the circumstances at the time, was clearly unfair, the court may, upon the application of the interested party, revoke the legal act.</p>
<p>Qiu Zhuyu asks: I previously read the Municipal Government's Bulletin No. 6: the policy of giving a chance of renewal to the people involved in opium and drugs by the municipal authorities is truly admirable and makes the people grateful. However, the questioner still has some questions about the second article of the second item of the implementation principles of the plan, "Those who plant, manufacture, transport, and sell opium and drugs are allowed to sign a pledge of renewal before the end of February 1946, and those who fail to do so will be sent to the military law authorities for punishment according to law." That is, the article does not specify whether it is limited to the principals, or includes general practitioners related to opium and drugs. Are all of these personnel required to sign a pledge of renewal? If the law is in effect outside of the recovered area of Shanghai, and these people are now living in Shanghai, can they be handled in the same way by citing this law? I hope you can provide instructions and answers.</p>
<p>[Answer by Lawyer Cao Yaxia] Anyone who has planted, manufactured, transported, or sold opium and drugs is a co-conspirator under criminal law. Even if they are not the principal offender, they should be considered an accessory, and they should also sign a pledge of renewal. As for "personnel from outside the recovered area of Shanghai who are now living in Shanghai," they should be handled in accordance with the municipal laws and regulations.</p>
