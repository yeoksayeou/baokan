<h3>和平空氣又趨黯淡　中共向政府提出備記錄　顯係藉口推卸軍事責任</h3>
<p>〔本報南京一日電〕日來首都商談空氣正趨開則，周恩來覆函與其抵京日期亦爲各方所注意，而政府方面忍讓謀和乃至積極作召開會議之準備，使一般關心國事之人士，益增樂觀之信念，但一日晴空中忽又湧起陰雲，即共產黨公佈之備忘錄一事，該件係周恩來，董必武，葉劍英，吳玉章，陸定一，鄧穎超，李維漢等六人署名，致政協代表轉陳蔣主席，卅日夜時派專人自滬携京，一日上午十時由董必武與王炳南携帶同樣內容一份送交馬特使，並進行晤談，至十一時五分辭出，中午董王應司徒大使隔夕之邀，往大使館以該項備忘錄內容吿大使，至於致政府代表之一份，則亦飭妥人送達具吳秘書長鐵城，此項備忘錄之內容不僅在强調張家口戰事爲藉口，同時以三個月來一切軍事行動全部責任推卸於政府，過去歷次彼此間之備忘錄，均互相保守秘密，此次獨不然，一般人士看法，亦有突兀之感。記者一日晚曾以此詢中共代表團發言人公佈備忘錄，是否事先取得調人同意，發言人稱，此次備忘錄之公佈，係因中共對張家口戰事特加重視，且欲一般人士對此事件充分明瞭，政府方面對此事仍持緘默態度，蓋以目前和平漸有進展，不願有故造破裂之舉動，調解方面之馬特使與司徒大使，記者詢其發言人康納士，亦無何表示，惟衆信此或將使調人陷於更困難之境，在過去數日內，王炳南與馬司間之接觸，曾有和緩之表示，並強調中共態度之轉變，馬司對和平前途亦因而樂觀，今又突發此項備忘錄，實足表明其企圖走上破裂之途。又據熟悉內幕之人士稱，周恩來在滬與各方之接見，主要目的在促使民盟之再團結，因共黨不能掌握民盟，則不願貿然參加非正式五人小組會議，此實爲其內談一般問題，再與馬使交換意見，九時五十分離去，逕至政院訪宋院長談約兩小時，大使即返使館，宋院長當即往謁主席，有所報吿，下午五時大使私人顧問傅涇波，再訪宋院長，談三刻鐘，晚七時，大使就其私邸宴請馬特使夫婦，馬氏一日上午十時曾接見董必武，王炳南晤談至十一昌，下午則與大使數通電話。</p>
<h3>周恩來對記者稱　一切關鍵在停戰　中共要求停止進攻張垣</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕周恩來於昨日下午在寓所執行本市中外記者，出席者達百人左右，周氏即席聲稱：</p>
<p>自上次與諸君相見後，又已月餘，此一時期果如余所預料，又在「拖」中過去，惟全國內戰，愈來愈大，現已蔓延至張家口門戶。政府已動員九個軍，由熱冀綏三面，向察省推進，戰鬥已於二日前開始。「解放區」聶榮臻司令已向北平調處執行部發出備忘錄，繼之，中共代表團已向蔣主席提出抗議，余本人亦奉令向馬帥提出備忘錄，北平執行部中共代表葉劍英亦已向政府代表提出備忘錄。此等抗議及備忘錄皆已明白指陳，如政府仍繼續進攻，中共不得不認爲政府有意摧毁和平談判一切後果及責任，應由國民政府負之。</p>
<p>自日本投降以來，中共之態度，始終係爲和平、民主、獨立、統一而奮鬥。自馬帥參加調處以後，中共之主張仍爲停戰及依照政協決議辦理一切。中共之立塲始終未變。去年雙十節，聯合文吿發表後，戰爭至本年一月始止，而政府不願在東北停戰，戰事遂又發生，本年三月後，戰火延至關內，直至於今。</p>
<p>現政府已進攻張家口，在此嚴重情况之下，政府不僅不欲停戰，且攻佔張家口後，必尙有更多之要求。</p>
<p>最近馬帥司使，又提同時開三人會及非正式五人小組，我人以爲不論一個會或兩個會，皆僅形式問題，今日之關鍵在於停戰，在於停止進攻以張家口爲中心之察哈爾。</p>
<p>政治方面，自政協決議通過後，二、三、四、三月間，政府綜合小組及憲草小組仍在渝開會。破壞政協者，實爲國民黨。蔣主席曾公開宣布國大無限期延期，俟商議有成就後再開，而七月中忽不與各黨協商，即宣布於十一月中開會，最近又突然命令各方開列名單，此顯爲參加政協之各民主份子所不願。</p>
<p>我人以爲不論三人會，五人小組，或國大，一切關鍵在於停戰，在於停止向張家口進攻。如政府停止向張家口進攻，則尙有談判之餘地，否則政府係決心欲破壞一切和議之可能，一切責任。應由國民黨負之。</p>

<p>請願團一行晋謁主席時，由徐寄庼說明該團組織經過，與此來任務，繼由駱淸華詳述工商業當前危機，及對政府希望，略謂：目前工商情形，以工業爲最艱，而正當商業亦因受高利貸壓迫，深感資金週轉不靈之苦，若干人因上海零售商歇業，因而輕視滬地工商危機，其實抗戰以來，零售商因國貨昻貴，無法推銷，成改售外貨與走私物品，藉以維持，此並非好現象。其次，滬人口增加，四百萬人集中舊租界中，表面似繁榮，實際上購買力已大不如前，外强中乾，未可樂觀，近兩二月來，廠商歇業者幾無日無之，其原因有三：第一，由於資金缺乏，受高利貸之剝削，第二，因工資增加，成本隨之提高；第三，舶來品與剩餘物資之低價傾銷此外，尙有若干工商榮正處於不生不死狀態中，如針織業，絲織業等，因資金缺乏，三日中幾有兩日停工，產品旣缺，成本自貴，必致燈盡油乾而後已。晨業方面，亦有此種痛苦，致有貨棄於地之現象，言之痛心。國際貿易方面，目前本爲我開拓國際市塲之最佳機會，但由於滙率關係，，成本不够，無法輸出，而日本在麥帥扶植下，正謀積極發展，令人憤慨之餘，深感警惕。我人若不能於一年內奠定國際貿易基礎，在政府方面，能作重大犧牲，則爭取國際市塲，殊屬無望。駱氏繼就請願團所提請求，逐條說明要點，謂：抗戰結束已歷一載，海口敞開，外貨來者日多，應請政府一改過去之戰時經濟政策，並改善金融措施，加強銀行專業化，强化金融與工業聯繋，加强中央與地方聯繫，以低利展開農工商業生產貸款，從增加生產獎勵　出，達到收縮通貨，平衡國際收支。最後並說明京滬以至全國關係之重要，盼能集中中央與地方之力量，合力以赴。繼由各代表逐次發言，，奚玉書希望銀行能專業化，國家銀行對工貸·農貸數目能放寬，俾工商界能得實惠，並指出政府過去只注重接收等工作，對工商疾苦未加注意，建設工作亦無表現，實爲「不吃蛋而吃雞」之辦法。陶百川陳述上海市府財政拮据情形，最近雖決議增加兩種新稅，從事建設工作，然仍惑不敷，盼政府能將出售上海接收物資所得款項中，撥出半數，充滬市建設費之用。金潤庠提及請願關上次來京經過，盼政府對所建諸點，能予採納實施，王先靑說明四聯貸款利息，名義上爲五分，而加上手續費等，實際上爲一角，盼政府改善。此外俞佐　、王延松、徐國懋、楊撫生等，亦各有意見發表，由主席一一答覆，先後歷時約三刻鐘，至五時三刻始辭出。</p>
<h3>調整匯率免出口稅　仍難挽救工商業　吳鐵城謂政府自當扶植</h3>
<p>請願團於一日晨九時左右，在浙灴興業銀行會齊後，首至中央黨部，當由秘書長鐵城，陳部長立夫接見，先由徐團長寄庼，說明此來任務與目前工商業之危機，盼政府能予救濟。繼由金潤庠致詞，力言目前經濟危機之嚴重性，與物價高漲之情形，盼政府能確定一經濟政策，並執行上次請願團來京所提各點。據稱：政府調整匯率，豁免出口稅，仍不足以挽救垂危之工商業，迄今爲止，工廠倒閉之事，仍時有發生，擬請政府注意，詞畢，吳秘書長鐵城作答，略謂：政府對目前經濟危機，與工商界同樣深表焦慮，對各種工商業自當設法予以扶植。旋由駱淸華致詞，首說明當前經濟政策應加改善之點，指出過去所行之緊縮信用，膨脹通貨辦法，促成生產萎縮，而對外貿易則門戶洞開，任令外貨進口，工商前途危險殊甚，此非僅爲上海一地之問題。駱氏又說明請願團所提兩點建議，盼政府能援當年一二八戰事後之先例，在滬設一經濟復興委會，請由宋院長任會長，市長及參議會會長任副會長，並請政府以一萬億接收物資中之半數，撥作復興上海專款，蓋此類物資，盡爲日人取之於老百姓之民脂民膏，自應歸還失主。駱氏末並大聲疾呼稱：工商業情形嚴重已至於此，決不能任其再受摧殘，繼續萎縮，造成都市饑饉，而發生不堪設想之後果，深盼過去曾任上海市畏之吳秘長，能將此種意見轉達。末由奧秘長作答，略謂：余過去任上海市長時，市府極能與市民合作，上海爲全國經濟中心，欲謀國家經濟復興，須先謀此重要中心之安定，政府自當盡力與工商界合作。</p>
<p>請願團自中央黨部辭出後，即赴政院，本擬謁宋院長，因宋氏與司徒大使及傳逕波等有所商談，改由蔣秘書長夢麟，財部兪部長鴻鈞，及經部王部長接見，由徐審庼駱淸華等相繼發言，說明此來任務，與上海工商界所希望於政府各點，談至下午一時始辭出，下午三時，往訪國防最高委會副秘書長梁寒操，談約三刻　辭出。</p>

<h3>開發東北資源　機遇千載難逢　張禹九氏考察歸來談話</h3>
<p>〔中央社本市訊〕東北貿易情形，經濟狀况，頗爲滬上人士深切關懷，中央社記者頃晤對此間題親赴東北作竟月考察返滬之中國進出口貿易協會理事長及中國植物油廠總經理張禹九氏，據稱：東北蘊藏富庶，新興事業有待發展者，觸目都是，認爲發展經濟，端賴開發資源，在資源採伐前，尤須人力充沛，東北對此，確具優惠條件，自光復後，政府勵精圖治，積極整頓，以通匯，通運，通航，通電，通船，爲當前急務，目前概况對久懸未決之通匯問題已獲辦法，央行頒佈新匯率已誌各報；火車暫爲軍管時期，對出口貨物希酌撥車皮，體恤商艱；飛機若航委會以外，開闢中航班次，空運暢通，特殊化心理可以打消，通電問題，尤爲切要。東北工廠烟肉不見濃烟，過去均由永吉小　滿電氣廠供給電力，發電能率達六十萬瓩，經修復後，亦能至十六萬瓩，至通電須越過中共地區問題，經協商經過，以該廠供應一部份電力至哈爾濱作交換條件，現已洽定，電綫敷竣即行開始。通能爲推動貿易唯一要素，營口，葫蘆島，秦皇島，現時三大海口雖車運可達，而對以上咽喉重地、船隻稀少，碼頭倉庫尚未修完，致大豆皮毛等均堆置而未能儘量運入關內。張氏繼稱：當局雖對敵僞工廠，按其性質分爲中央，地方政府，生產局或民營方面，予以合理分配，惟就本人觀察所及，其已開工者僅賴手中剩餘原料，維持自給自足，正常經營及大規模者甚尠，若不通盤籌劃、以產資運銷爲前提，一且原料凈盡。危機堪虞，在敵人過去雄圖以東北貿易配合世界及華北需要，現値日人原氣未復，朝鮮政局尙未納入常軌，把握時機，擴展交通，加强開發，爲千載難逢機遇，英美及加拿大合灣缺乏大豆，華北缺乏食糧，關內年產最多能達六〇〇萬担之大豆及剩餘高桑，小米，加緊輸出，以充裕國庫，如此民生優厚，亦可對政府上獲得新活力矣。氏又鄭重聲稱：東北生產計劃應迅速重建，原有技術人員似嫌不足，即麥帥對遠東最高決策，將原有日僑二百萬人口減退至十萬，現聞再度遞減，以予我人自建機會，固屬可佩，但離實際需要太遠，應急起直追，配合日人未完計劃，加以光大，以攫取世界貿易基地，並希望國內工商領袖，放開眼光，一瞻東北，再顧中原，則如滄海一粟，海上一蝸地，更無論矣。如能聯袂奮起，開發東北，則個人成就，事業發展，國運昌隆，實富有無限新希望焉。</p>

<p>社論</p>
<h3>中共的備忘錄</h3>
<p>中共代表團的備忘錄，已於昨晨送達政府代表，轉呈蔣主席，要求政府立即停止對張家口及其周圍之一切軍事行動，否則即宣吿全面破裂，並將因此造成的一切嚴重後果諉諸於政府。我們聽慣了中共的口頭宣傳，我們又看慣了中共的言論主張，對於這個備忘錄，並沒有新頴的因素，所以也不詫異；是我們老百姓，旣日夜渴望國內和平統一，當然也希望中共政府，化干弋爲玉帛，化戾俗氣爲祥和；但是我們看了中共的備忘錄，發生了有幾點感想：</p>
<p>第一，最近三個月來的戰亂，究底誰引起的？應該由何方負責？一月十日的停戰令，因中共在東北成立其所謂「民主聯軍」，以阻止國軍開入恢復主權，而被中共破壞殆盡，以致未能收到停戰的功效，姑置勿論；即以六月七日政府再度下停戰令而論，也是因爲中共迷信武力爲萬能，不僅不願遵守方案統編整編，將其黨軍交與國家，而且仍在那裏破壞交通，據兵作亂，企圖擴充地盤，爭城奪地，中共軍的圍攻大同，處心積慮，已非一日，是衆所週知的事實；而中共在備忘錄中卻說：『中共對大同之戰，僅是阻撓山西關胡軍隊之進攻，屬於解圍性質。』這一句話，有誰相信呢？誰都明白，這三個月來的戰亂，是從中共圍攻大同而開始的。</p>
<p>第二，中共要求政府立即停止對張坦的軍事行動，並不需要以「宣吿全面破裂」相威脅。因爲國共談話之門、依然洞開，過去談判固然停頓在「三」「五」之爭；但自蔣主席返京後，仍本其愛好和平的初衷，對中共表示寬大，已接受調人馬帥的折衷辦法，主張三人小組與五人委員會同時舉行，俾使軍事與政治問題，得以同時解決。如果中共眞有和平的誠意，只要中共代表周恩來即日返京，恢復商談，不僅張垣的戰爭的可以平息，就是在全國各地也可以化干戈爲玉帛。</p>
<p>要之，人民渴望和平，政府企求和平，只要中共有「求和』的誠意，一切問題就不難也解決。中共何必要誇大其詞，以「全面破裂」相威脅呢？我們老百姓的神經早已非常緊張，決不能再受中共神經戰的刺激了。</p>
<h3>取締人力車平議</h3>
<p>滬市府發表，奉令取締人力車，用抽籤辦法，預期三年淘沃完竣，本年十一月，即須淘汰車號十分之一，其中約有營業人力車二千另六十五輛，自用人力車六百三十輛。從國家的體面看來，我們自當贊成這個政令。</p>
<p>人力車的所在地，我們縱觀全球，衹限於亞洲，而亞洲方面，國家之有相當地位的，人力車的痕跡，也逐漸消滅。如戰前日本，在未成强國以前，原是人力車最多的地方，等到國力一强盛，人力車也就絕跡。往日本的旅客，除橫濱市尙有幾輛人力車可見外，其餘如東京大阪等地全都禁絕。即在英國統治下的印度，孟買市已完全沒有人力車，馬德拉斯雖有而甚少，衹加爾各答還有數量相當大的人力車。印度以外，尙淪在殖民地地位的國家，如緬甸，馬來亞，越南等地，尙有不少的人力車。中國旣爲獨立而巨大之國家，在亞洲又肩負起安定世界和平之重任，自不應再留有此稱可恥的殖民地的特徵。從國際的觀感上，我們不贊成中國依然永遠有人力車。</p>
<p>從人道主義上論，我們也不贊成中國再有人力車的存在。人生而要吃飯，但吃飯的方法畢竟很多。拉黃包車，行動如牛馬，社會之有此種制度，無形中已剝奪了此種勞苦者在形式上所應有的崇高的人格，降低了這許多窮苦國民的自尊心，實際上削弱了國家在精神上的實力，從而傳國家在基膚力量末由鞏固。所以中國如欲走上和英美蘇聯等具有同等地位的國家，人力車的取締，其理由是充分的。况且人力車夫在工作的時候，兩乎拉着車向前亂奔，氣喘如牛，汗流浹背。夏天受烈日的薰炙，冬天受朔風的攻襲，身體上所受氣候方面的摧殘，更不待言。這種下級的不人道的生活方法，國家自然沒有予以保存的必要，政府的取締人力車，在這方面講，我們也無可　議。</p>
<p>所可慮者，在今日這個時期這個局面，要嚴厲的立即取締人力車，在時間上講，是否完全妥適？在大戰剛罷的今天，防正失業，是各國政府最緊要的課題。英美法等國家，在第一次大戰吿終後，親受着全國失業方面的嚴重而不可泯滅的敎訓，因此就在這次大戰未吿終以前，即已用盡方法，研究如何减去失業之道。果然經此努力，至少在目前，英美等盟國，還沒有遭遇到任何因失業而起的困難。他們的政府當局應付這個問題，已有豐富的經騐。他們知道全國民衆的人數一增加，會使政治更易陷於錯綜複雜，會使經濟更易受不景氣的打擊，從</p>
<p>反觀我們一切措置，不論有意無意，似乎正在竭力製造失業。從勝利以來，時僅一年，有許多機關裁撤了，增加了無數的失業。許多工廠倒閉了，又增加了許許多多的失業。巴路上的攤販取締了，平空又製造出不知多少的失業。現在又要取締全國的人力車，這一着棋，更普遍的激動了這班廣大勞動者的不安、中國政局現在是在這樣的動蕩之中，正宜一時求其安定，先獲得一個安居樂業的機會，再圖進步。此時急急忙忙取締全國人力車，似乎有和政治上客觀的環境不能配合之嫌。</p>
<p>對於人力車的取締，在今天似乎並不是一個最適當的時間。因此，我們希望行政當局能够權且從緩辦理，還是暫從緩辦爲宜。如果必須要辦，那麼在取締的時候，一切辦法，務必求其平衡妥善。不可操之過急，不當罰之過嚴，期使這班勞苦人民的精神，不致刺激太甚。務使他們在取締以後的吃飯問題，雖不是全部有了着落，至少一部分也有切實的解決辦法。一件好政令的推行，往往帶着極大的困難。這是我們所知道的。我們願政府採取鄭重穏妥的辦法，以求逐漸達到這個「中國無人力車」的進步境界。</p>
<h3>國際文教合作</h3>
<p>聯合國文敎科學機構，行將召開於巴黎。美國國務院爲準備參加是項國際會議、特召開文敎科學國家委員會於美京。杜魯門總統於接見該會委員時，對國際文敎合作事業備加贊揚與勉勵，其書曰：「余認爲文敎科學組織，對世界和平之貢獻，將不下其它與聯合有關之組織。該組織將喚起吾人爭取利平之力量。當吾人瞭解他人之觀點及他人瞭解吾人時，吾人當能從事商討，從而摒棄各種異見。吾人如無諒解，吾人即無和平可言；吾人如無敎育，吾人亦無和平可言。……」可知關於國際文敎合作，美國自杜魯門統以次，對之如何關注而寄予殷切的期望。</p>
<p>在世界和平秩序的重建上，的確沒有一種努力能够像國際文敎合作這樣基本。國與國間之所以有衝突，原因就在人與人之間的沒有了解；使人與人之間增加彼此的了解，端在增進國際間文敎的合作。這是一個文化的問題，敎育的問題。人類應該了解人類生活在各種不同的文化環境中。我們固然應該提高人類的文化水準，但我們同時亦須記取各種文化環境的形成，原各有其歷史的背景，我們要有容納另種文化生活的了解和度量。如以爲自己的文化生活爲崇高而強別人從同，這卻變成令人壓惡的Kultur，這不愉快的名稱，象徵了過去普魯士的　武主義和希特勒的納粹主義。國際文教合作，其用意就在各民族文化中，推進民族間的了解和携手。世界和平的所以遭到廠脅，主要是某一民族的文化生活，包括其思想行爲，思以武力加諸於不屬於這民族的人。德國的軍閥如此，日本的軍閥亦如此。人類在經過了兩次世界大戰後的覺醒，這該在國際文數合作中求之。此所以杜魯門總統在接見美國文敎科學國家委員會委員時說：「吾人如此諒解，吾人即無和平可言；吾人如無敎育，吾人亦無和平可言」。</p>
<p>中國在國際文敎合作中所負的責任是艱巨的。我們是一個文化的古國，縱然在科學及技術方面，或許比較落後，但在精神文化方面，我們原有我們的寶藏。自從中國與世界交往以來，我們先哲所留下來的文化遺產，其間雖也有若干些小部分被介紹到西方，一鱗半爪，我們整個民族文化遺的全貌，尙未爲世人所熟稔。所以在這個時候，我們應該特別致力於我國民族文化的宣揚，使我先哲如孔孟的思想學說，像亞里斯多德一樣，也能够變成世界文化遺產的一部，而增進世界對於我國的了解。因此，我們應該特別重視我們在國際文敎合作中所處的地位。</p>
<p>爲了這種重要關係，同時，鑒於美國有文敎科學國家委員會的組織，我們認爲我國在準備參加國際文敎合作時，在國內也該有同樣的組織。在關於國際文敎合作方面，我們知道這是敎育部主管的範圍；但敎育部爲行政機構，似應於敎育部之外，或在敎育部之下，另設類似美國那樣的文敎科學國家委員會，由中央研究院，北平硏究院，各著名的大學，中央文化運動委員會，及其它有關方面類似博物院圖書館或科學社團等，共同組織，專以參加國際文敎合作爲主要業務。例如關於於聯合國文敎組織在中國　成立的數學中心，究應隨國都設在南京抑　設置它處，便可經該項組織的商討而決定。關於國際文敎合作，不僅屬於敎育行政，同時亦處處　國策有關。</p>
<p>總之，關於國際文敎合作，實是一種極重要的工作。我國在此項工作中所處的地位，特別重要，人家有望於我們的也特別殷切。所以對於參加此項工作，我們特別應該有優良的表現，以增進世人對於我們的了解。</p>

<p>〔法國新聞社紐倫壁一日電〕國際法庭今日最後一庭，將各犯分別定　，被定罪者雖有故作鎭靜者，但不安之色露於面容，其中弗里轍忽哭忽笑，尤爲滑稽。其人嘗爲無綫電宣傳家，善於做作，初聞法官宣佈其無罪，頓覺深深感動，及聞其知己鮑爾曼定罪，眼淚盈眶，轉念鮑爾曼不過缺席判決，並無大礙，又破涕爲笑矣。法庭退庭時，被定罪諸人圍繞沙赫特，巴本及弗里轍，慶祝三人無罪開釋。史庇爾與沙赫特握手，歷時甚多，蓋此爲兩人最後一次握手矣。</p>
<h3>判決書要點　侵略爲最大罪狀</h3>
<p>〔聯合社紐倫堡三十日電〕國際軍事法庭今日宣讀判決書之一部份，其要點如下；</p>
<p>違反國際公法之罪爲人（並非抽象的單位）所犯，惟有懲劇犯罪之個人，國際公法之條文乃得實施。個人負有國際責任，此種責任實超越服從國家之義務。德國會接受獨裁及其一切恐怖與卑睨一切的方式，並公然否認法治。希特勒在「我的奮鬥」一書中，已將準備侵略之野心充分說明。德國對波蘭發動戰爭，實爲明目張胆之侵略戰，侵攻比利時荷蘭及盧森堡，毫無理由。德國並曾縝密計劃摧毀蘇聯，不使成爲政治及軍事强國，蘇聯企圖攻擊德國之說，難以令人置信。直接攻擊美國之可能性，曾作爲將來之事而加以考慮。李賓特洛甫本人曾促請松岡洋右使日本對英美作戰。此外，法庭組織章程曾規一定策劃或從事侵略戰或違反國際條約之戰爭，均爲犯罪行爲。法庭判決若干被吿爲對十二個國家策劃並從事侵略戰者，故犯有上述各罪。各被吿身爲德國政府官員，全體或至少一部份應知德國曾簽訂禁止採用戰爭解決國際糾紛之各項條約。大部份被吿諉稱係泰希特勒命令行事，不能對執行命令所犯之罪負責。但法庭規約第八條規定，被吿奉政府或上司命令行事，不應解除其責任，但或可考慮减輕懲罰。考諸多數國家刑法出入之處，眞正關鍵並不在於命令問題，而在於道德的選舉問題。</p>
<h3>紐倫堡法庭隆重定讞　爲審判日戰犯創先例　勾結侵略違反人道罪無可逭</h3>
<p>〔聯合社東京一日電〕紐倫堡法庭對於德國戰爭犯隆重定讞，影響於東京國際法庭審訊日本廿七被吿案情者甚大。紐倫堡法庭在法理上所創先例，打擊日本被吿辯護論據，即軍閥由於愛國心騙使，企圖自無可如何之局勢中拯救國家，可吿無罪。日本多數被吿顯已放棄無罪開釋之希望，但最後仍將以美國與盟國驅策日本作戰爲聲辯。官方意見暫時尙不能探悉，但據觀察家意見，紐倫堡法庭對於各種罪狀，侵略戰及德日陰謀之存在，旣特別加以判定，則以國家自衛爲申辯之任何企圖，前途仍甚黯淡。德日陰謀主角之一日本前外相松岡洋右，業已病死，無從追究，其他重要被吿爲前駐德大使大島，其人在兩處法庭之證件中均曾提及。紐倫堡法庭之定讞，對於高級人員違反人道之殘暴及罪行，予以確定，此間檢察團特別加以重視，日本戰爭犯自作惡多端之東條以至南京暴行主角松井均在其內。紐偷堡法庭對於若干國社黨組織之定罪，目前並不直接影響日本。聞此間檢察團已討論審訊日本機關全體人員如憲兵隊之類，但目前所決定者仍在檢舉個別人員，並非整個組織。日本憲兵隊人員現由麥帥總部法理股主任卡本脫負責檢舉。</p>
<h3>四外長會議</h3>
<p>討論處理特港問題</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕巴黎一日廣播：四強外長今日下午舉行會議，對義大利政治領土委會議程上最後一事之特港地位辯論問題，商討如何處理之法。</p>
<p>〕本報訊〕倫敦一日廣播：和會各委會加緊工作，擬於十月五日以前完成，對巴爾幹政治及領土委員會今日開會時，表決修改希保國境問題，結果大多數反對修改，惟希臘贊成，荷蘭與南菲棄權。</p>
<h3>艾森豪威爾談國際合作</h3>
<p>〔路透社柏林三十日電〕美陸軍參謀總長艾森豪威爾將軍，今日在此招待記者稱：每一聰明之人均知世界不能再忍受另一世界大戰，人類之文明亦不能再遭戰禍。余個人以爲吾人在避免戰爭的一方面，已有若干進步。美國一部份人士具有神經質的悲觀，孫屬非是，吾人決不可沮喪，國際合作乃非不可能之事。吾人應繼績合作，以產生良好結果，例如柏林之盟國控制委員會，即爲本於誠意執行任務之機稱，英美在德之經濟合作，亦爲一良好之例子。</p>
<h3>美注視法律土關係</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕舊金山一日廣播：政府方面人士稱：關於蘇聯最近致送土耳其有關韃靼尼爾海峽之照會，土國政府已向英美政府徵詢意見，決定答覆辦法。據稱：美方之答覆將於一星期內發出」事前須與海陸軍當局交換意見，人民不必過分驚慌，但局勢緊張則係事實。蘇聯之照會中要求參與管理海峽，華盛頓方面之種種徵象，顯示英美將勸土國拒絕此項要求。</p>
<h3>世界銀行貸款　各國即可申請</h3>
<p>穏定匯兌事將開會討論</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦一日廣播：世界銀行總理梅耶稱：此擁有資金九十億美元之世界金融機構，即將開始貸款與受戰事損害之各國，但截至目前止，尙不接獲正式之借款申請。法·波·捷三國已非正式請求貸款，計法國五萬萬元，波蘭六萬萬元，捷克三萬五千萬元。梅氏在其第一次年報內稱：渠擬要求國會，准許美國儲蓄銀行及保險公司投資於世界銀行。梅氏並謂：將於十月內舉行國際貨幣會議，討論穏定滙兌事宜。</p>
<h3>聯合國基金　我全部付清</h3>
<p>〔合衆社紐約三十日電〕聯合國今日宣稱：中國對聯合國總部基金全部墊款、已繳付最後一批計六十萬元。</p>
<h3>杜魯門總統闡述太平洋基地政策　美海長談地中海艦隊任務</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社華盛頓卅日電〕杜魯門總統本日舉行特別記者招待會，說明美國對太平洋現有基地之政策，海軍總司令陶威士上將亦在座。依照總統宣佈之計劃，關島與塞班島將保持爲西太平洋美國防務網之心臟。在琉球，特魯克，埃庇微多克及瓜加林各島設立次要基地。美國將在菲律賓方面利用何一基地，尙未決定。新幾尼亞方面，美擬放棄澳屬曼紐斯島基地之一部份。北太平洋方面，阿拉斯加附近柯臺克島正設立鞏固之基地，以供美海眾利用。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社華盛頓卅日電〕海軍部長福雷斯特頃在此間，發表談話說明美海軍在地中海之任務。略謂：溯自十九世紀初葉以來，美國即按期在歐洲各海面，尤其是地中海海面留駐艦隊。第一次世界大戰結束後局勢尙未穏定之數年中，美國地中海艦隊對樹立巴爾幹與中東各國之和平，曾有莫大之貢獻。時至今日，美國海軍仍繼續留駐大西洋東部及地中海，其目的有二：（一）接濟歐洲各佔領區內盟國佔領軍軍需，並協助盟國軍政府履行其領任務。（二）保護美國利益，並支持美國之政策。同時，美國在各該區留駐海軍有下列各項利益：（一）美國海軍官兵可獲得極好之訓練機會，並可熟悉其所巡邏之海面，與其所訪問國家之傳統與習慣。（二）振作海軍士氣，良以多數官兵仍以「開廣眼認爲加人海軍之目的。（三）美海軍人員可獲得機會與其所接觸之人民實行親善與諒解</p>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓三十日電〕杜魯門總統今日接獲關於太平洋上美海軍軍事行動之詳細報吿，隨即與海軍部長福萊斯特及太平洋戰區總司令　威士晤談。陶氏吿記者稱：海軍於預算核减後，巳將戰後原擬保留之根據地數目减少。</p>

<h3>遠東法庭上風波一場　法檢察官司堅持用法語發言　因違反規定庭長勃然大怒</h3>
<p>〔聯合社東京一日電〕遠東國際法庭今日經整日辯論後，決定允許法檢察官奧奈脫用本國語發言，惟奧氏以辭職爲要挾，應向庭上表示道歉。據奧氏自稱：本人係代表偉大之法國，如不允許本人用法語惟有退出此案，魏勃聞言大怒，謂希望於下午開庭時，聽取奧氏道歉。檢聯官即提請退庭至明晨續開，俾奧氏可有充分時間考慮是否將向法庭道歉，抑或退出。魏勃曾吿奧氏稱：法庭規程中規定僅許用英語或日語發言。被吿辯護律師列文稱：法庭規程中特別規定僅能用英語與日語，法庭無權修正規程，但法庭終於允許使用法語，意謂蘇聯檢察官將來亦可使用俄語。</p>
<p>〔聯合社東京一日電〕遠東國際法庭今日開庭時，檢察長季楠要求法庭兼用法文，申辯兩小時，至午刻退庭，未有決定。審判長魏勃稱：問題重心在法庭是否有權採用第三或第四種文字，因法庭規則證詞限用英語與日語。</p>
<h3>法國在復興中（上）</h3>
<p>— 本報特派員頌虞</p>
<p>〔巴黎九月十五日通訊〕一位在巴黎住得稍久的朋友，帶我上館子去吃飯，爲了一百公分的麵包，無意中和一位侍役爭辯起來。按照法國的規定，每人每餐的食量，麵包一百公分，但這位朋友天生有兼人的食量，非二百公分不够果腹，因爲侍役不肯多給，這位朋友便冒起火來，說：「你們多少法國人在中國大喝大嚼，我們也沒有理論過，怎麽這幾個中國人，你們便小氣起來」？不料這句話倒博得不少鄰座法國人的同情，都起帮腔，並詢問中國的現况，有人問「中國現在食品沒有問題罷」！這位朋友更理直氣壯的說，「沒有間題，衹要有錢便行」。法國人似乎還不大深信，又掉轉頭來徵求我的意見，問</p>
<p>「有錢便行嗎」？我也苦笑着說：「有錢什麼都行」。大致講來，今日法國的情形雖不似中國那樣，一方面餓殍載道，而酒樓歌館卻依然珍　狼藉。同時却也不致像英國那樣限制這樣嚴格，食單總是這幾味價格總是怎麼些，有錢的人無用武之地，無錢窮人也不愁飢死。法國則彷彿介乎其間窮人雖稍差，有錢的人也自有其發揮財富威力的寬闊餘地，但不是漫無限制。我們從英國轉客來此的人已躊躇滿志，樂不思蜀了，自然再不敢過分苛求。我們在客觀地位仔細觀察，不能不贊美人家恢復之快。英法兩國都已近戰前舊觀了，所不同者，</p>
<p>英貨重視國外貿易，最好的出品都銷售國外爭取市塲，祗有價廉而且必要的物品才准在國內銷售。所以迄今英國市上，無奢侈品見到，但如翻閱貿易部的月報，便知英國的出口貿易，數字早已超過前，且現在正繼續增加，可知英國工業恢復之速了。反之，法國的工商業雖也在迅速復原，出口貨也在遂月增加，但以種種關係，尙難與英美媲美。且法國的政策也不似英國的那樣富有鬥爭心，工廠的出品不論奢侈品也好，實用品也好，都可以在國內外同樣銷售，各玻璃窗內，盡是新奇出品，炫人心目，尤其對於一般倫敦的來客，彷彿有誤入仙境之感。實際上全世界喜購漂亮裝束的人，目光又漸漸都轉到巴黎來了。在我客居巴黎的期間，巴黎開了一個</p>
<p>時裝展覽會，爲各大舖子做廣吿，一時鬨動歐洲，紐約前鋒論壇報的歐洲版就用大字標題，說法國的時裝又在領導世界了，世界愛美人士，又要以巴黎的新樣爲風行的準則了。所以今後人間享樂的仙境或則又要數到巴黎了。某次記者在席間碰到一位新來巴黎的美國少女，問他對巴黎的印象如何，他說「好極了，要什麽，有什麽」。我問他比美國怎樣，她稍想一下說，「除了牛奶稍嫌不够外，我旁的沒有感到不便」。這就是巴黎今日的情况。不過，這里須補上一句，今日</p>
<p>巴黎物資甚多，奢侈品雖充斥但十九是法國本國的出品，很少舶來品，譬如說瑞士表是馳名世界的，美國人而到歐洲大陸的，沒有不買幾個瑞士表回去，但近水樓台的法國倒不易得瑞士表，市上鐘表多，盡是法國本國出品，很少有自瑞士運入的。由此一端，也可以證明法國工業復興之速</p>

<h3>羅列樣品·　·蔚爲大觀　出口貨展覽會昨日正式開幕　會塲設青年會規模宏大出口貨萎縮下意義深長</h3>
<p>〔本報特寫〕鑄備了三　月的中國出口貨展覽會，昨天下午二時，終於假八仙橋青年會，宣告正式開幕了！當記者從悶熱的車廂襄跨出來時，首先映入眼簾的，就是大幅紅白相間的布帶，圍繞了青年會巨　的大門精壁，點綴着「中國出口貨展覽會」的幾個巨字，使人預感到這該是個不平凡的展覽會。是的，在進口貨傾銷，出口貨萎縮的現狀態下，這個展覽會，是有它特殊底意義的。</p>
<p>桐油標本蒐羅無遺</p>
<p>記者到達青年會時，因爲底層的第一會塲尚未完全佈置好，只得從三樓的第六會塲，顛倒了次序看下來。第六會塲全由中國植物油料廠一家陳設展覽。這裏搜羅了各式各樣的植物油籽，此中最值得注意的，是我國的特產桐油。差不多自桐籽，桐葉，桐幹種種標本，都搜羅俱備。此中還植了一棵觧梮樹從上壁的圖表看來就可知道我國桐油在國際貿易上所佔的重要地位。一幅藍底白畫的桐油榨煉程序圖可使參觀者對桐油榨煉的經過，一目瞭然！第五會塲陳設的是搪瓷和瓷器。據說：搪瓷在戰前暢銷南洋各屬，現在則尚待開展中。瓷器部份，多的是小巧玲瓏的人物駿馬等擺件，幾件瓷盆，尤稱精品！</p>
<p>皮毛地毯引人注意</p>
<p>第二三四三處會塲，都在二樓。規模較五六兩會塲大多了！第四會塲裏，陳設的骨鈕，皮毛，地毯三物，都是引人注意底標的。皮貨部份，搜羅了各式獸皮。正中掛着一襲金錢豹皮女大衣，標價昂達二百五十萬元，此價是否適於外銷，倒是疑問？地毯部份，陳設的是恒豐永廠出品的針織羊毛地毯。據說：地毯的輸出以美國居大宗。最近外匯調整後地毯外銷已比較活潑。以該廠言最近平均月銷一萬平方尺。第三會塲陳設的有各式的針織品如花襪，手帕之類。還有以精細人工見勝的各式抽紗，燦爛奪目的五色鴨絨被。美亞織綢廠，也在這裏陳設起各種綢緞產品。</p>
<p>蠶絲損失向日索償</p>
<p>第二會塲有中國蠶絲公司，大誠綢廠，和電機絲織公會等全部絲織物的陳列品。聽說中國蠶絲公司，爲裝置樹窗及陳設等的支出，共達一千萬元之鉅。此中尤以紅藍綢襯底，白絲辮釘成的一大幅圖案，尤足使人警惕據上面揭載的數學，我國蠶絲業和出口貿易的關係，自一九二七年到一九三六年，年均出口總值爲一，〇六七，六〇九，〇〇〇元，平均　　出口值爲一五六，八五八，〇〇〇元，蠶絲出口值佔出口總值爲百分之十四·六九。本年一月至七月出口總值爲九六，三六四，七九一，〇〇〇元蠶絲出口值爲一六，六五九，二七一，六九〇元，蠶絲出口值佔出口總值爲百分之十七。另一方面，又揭載我國戰時蠶絲業的損失計絲產損失總計二百萬〇〇三千公担，蠶絲器械損失總計三億元（戰前幣值）。桑株損失總數二百萬株這些都待向日本索償！</p>
<p>外商參觀期望甚殷</p>
<p>第一會塲在最下層，規模最大，單位也最多。大中工業廠的縫衣針，縫纫機針，唱片針；開林罐頭廠的紹酒；新華玻璃廠的玻璃器皿；中國興業，益　，旦業三廠的熱水瓶；新亞，信誼，五洲，中法，佛慈各家的藥品，都各界特色。此外。我國的特產豬鬃和薄荷，這裏也有齊備的樣品陳列着。</p>
<p>據說：昨日第一天展覽，外商前去參觀的倒相當踴躍。這顯示出外商對中國的出口品，是抱着怎樣的一種期望。深望各出口廠商，能在品質方面，設法精益求精，成本方面，則力求减低，這是推展外銷的先決條件！同時，在一般市民方面，正不妨借展覽的機會，一廣見聞。展覽時間，自昨日起，至六日止，每日上午九時至十二時，下午二時至六時，參觀是完全免費的。</p>
<h3>偽市府盜賣地產　查出八分餘一塊</h3>

<h3>漫談記者招待會　有凶有狠有圓滑　亦刁亦刻亦幽默　有時可當好戲看有時如中催眠術</h3>
<p>〔本報特寫〕「昨日×時，×××招待本市各報社記者……」</p>
<p>這樣開始的新聞，近來在報紙上差不多每天總會有一條兩條，報紙的讀者們對於「記者招待會」這個名詞，大槪也人人都覺得耳熟能詳了。</p>
<p>但是，從被「招待」的記者看來，這許許多多記者招待會的「味兒」却是各不相同的：出度一次好的招待會，就簡直像看一塲好戲（當然有時不單是「看」，而且自己也「演」），舌劍唇槍，非常過癮；但是如果碰到了壞的招待會，那就實在頭痛無比，苦不堪言了。</p>
<p>「好」的招待會，第一是准時開始，第二是主人確係有話要說，而且能够說得頭頭是道。各政黨的招待會，大多都合於上面這兩個條件。好的發言人，能使你儘管不同意他的主張，可是你却不能不佩服他「頭頭是道」的一手，儘管你問得凶，他總是答得圓轉如意；你問得狠，他答得刁；你問得刻薄，他偏回答得幽默。</p>
<p>張君勱答覆俏皮</p>
<p>我覺得民主社會黨成立時的一次記者招待會是很成功的。第一，張君勱先生是一位學者，誠懇凝重，說的話句句着實，自然令人心服。第二，他的幾位帮手很好，四面繞圈子，把各記者的反應看得很準。正巧有一位喜歡發言的記者措辭稍欠得體，說出了稚氣的問題來，於是就有一位發言人俏皮地答覆了他，結果是全塲記者，哈哈一笑，就此立起來散了。你要曉得他怎樣問麼——</p>
<p>「請問張君勱先生：現在中國一般人腦子裏，彷彿祇有兩個黨，一個是國民黨，一個是共產黨。請問民主社會黨在思想上，還是偏向於國民黨呢，還是偏向於共產黨？」</p>
<p>那時候，坐在我對面的一位記者就寫了四個大字給我看：「找釘子砸！」</p>
<p>果然，張君勱先生又氣又好笑的回答說：「國民黨有多少人？算一萬萬吧。共產黨有多少人？算五千萬吧。那麼四萬萬五千萬中國人之中，剩下的還有不少，別的黨活動的範圍大得很——大得很！」</p>
<p>結果是大家哄堂。</p>
<p>魏德邁巧妙規避</p>
<p>還有許多要人們在招待會上逃避記者的質詢時，也往往頗有妙語。馬歇爾元帥來華不久時，曾召見那時尚未離華的魏德邁，而且密談頗久。有一位記者在魏德邁招待會上，就單刀直入的開了一砲，問：「魏將軍，可否把馬歇爾元帥和你談話的內容說一說？」</p>
<p>這個問題實在是各記者大家想問的，可是大家也知道魏德邁大槪很不願意回答這個問題。因之就空氣立刻緊張，大家看他怎樣答覆。</p>
<p>那裏知道，魏德邁摸了摸自己銀白的頭髪，說：「忘了。」</p>
<p>聯總駐華辦事處的新處長艾格登逃避記者詢問的方法，也很有趣。他先是斷斷續續的講了一篇就任感想及希望之類，剛一說完，就問「有沒有問題？」</p>
<p>十分鐘的招待會</p>
<p>實在，那時各記者頭腦裏關於聯總停運令的事，正有不知多少問題要提出來，不想那位艾格登將軍至多祇等了兩秒鐘，各記者問題的措詞還未想好，他倒已經「謝謝各位出席，以後再談」了。這記者招待會竟在記者們發問之前就告結束。我記得此會前後一共大槪不到十分鐘。</p>
<p>記者招待會時間最長的，要算以前的遷川桂工廠聯合會，往往一來就是七八篇演說，三四個鐘頭。誠然，內遷各工業家的遭遇實在值得大家的同情，但是，如果他們能經常用書面發佈言論，至少在招待會時可以不致弄得主人和記者大家精疲力盡；也免得記者們回家寫稿時還要大刀闊斧的竭力刪節，捨棄許多很好的材料。</p>
<p>烏烟瘴氣的飯堂</p>
<p>此地，我要提一提那些不大愉快的記者招待會了。行總各分署長來上海後，往往由該署編譯處召開記者招待會。這用意固然很好，可是這些招待會舉行的地方，却往往就是行總的飯堂，因爲鄰近廚房，所以炊烟起處，就頗有天地易色之感。往往招待無冕帝王之地，成爲烏烟瘴氣之塲。至於雪白的台布之下是否尚有油膩，雖不敢說，可是這空氣裏却的確充滿了甜的鹹的以至油膩膩的成份。</p>
<p>還有，陳納德將軍的招待會，也往往有些可怕。因爲此公飛機聲音聽得太多，雙耳有些失聰。有時你雖盡力「嚷」了問題，他却還是沒有聲見；答非所問的時候更是不一而足。</p>
<p>最是糟糕的一次</p>
<p>不過，最糟糕的一次招待會，却是記者節前夜在新生活俱樂部舉行的××局報告。這真是天時地理人和，三樣中一樣都沒有佔到。說「天時」罷，那天正好司徒大使到上海，大家忙得要命，而且六點鐘另有他約的人極多。不想×局長先是遲到了一個鐘頭，又是滔滔不絕的談一個不休——而實際上他早有詳盡的書面報告。說「地理」罷，那天新生活俱樂部正好有人假座結婚，和記者招待會的地方祇一牆之隔。裏面報告得高興，外面却樂隊演奏得熱烈。結果，記者們對局長哈哈大笑——如果不這樣一笑，他的報告也許結束得還要遲一點。至於「人和」，我想忠厚一些，不說也罷。不過我不妨籠統的提一句：和新聞記者們應接的時候，倒底還是「誠懇」比「圓滑」好。最壞是一個實在很誠懇的老實人，偏要學得圓滑——結果就成功了上海人所謂「豆腐靶子」，用英文說，就是一個Bore</p>

<h3>逆產處理困難　家屬生活費　酌留數待商　房屋多被佔住乏人承購</h3>
<p>〔本報訊」敵僞產業處理局逆　組，對於處理逆產、最大困難爲司法行政部對沒收逆產中酌留家屬生活費辦法，尙無答覆。同時處理逆產，需時甚久，必須俟被判各逆不再上訴，或上訴已遭　斥後，法院始將判決書送逆產處理委員會執行。目前已開始處理者，有陳逆公博，繆逆斌，褚逆民誼，楊逆傑，及梅逆思平之財產。處理之辦法，一方面將已查封之逆產標賣，並追查右無隱匿之情，獎勵密吿。另一方面調査各逆家屬情形。但標賣亦殊困難，因多數房屋皆被佔住，乏人承購。關於各逆產，係由司法機關委託處理局保管，處理局查封後，委託中央信託局保，而信託局則委託現住人保管。逆產中之傢具等物皆　登册，由信託局點騐，由現住人覓保負責保管。</p>
<p>又悉：本星期五下午。逆產處理委員會開會時。或將討論沒收逆產中，酌留家屬生活費問題。由於逆產多少，相產懸殊。倘規定一筆生活費數目，則若干逆產總値恐尙不抵此數。倘規定一百分比，則若干逆產之千分之一，已足供其家屬度豪奢生活而有餘。故此問題，殊難解決。</p>

<h3>美貨攤復活　城隍廟改觀　玻璃成立聯合商塲　溪口路盛況重見今日</h3>
<p>〔本報特寫〕！野草燒不盡，春風吹又生—現在雖非春天，然而一度被嚴厲取締的美貨攫販却在强烈的求生慾望下正如春風撫拂中的野草一般復活了。除去那些偷偸摸摸繼續在街頭巷尾以「游擊」姿態出現的以外，所不同的衹是「野草」已取得了合法的地位，被移植成爲「溫室中的盆景」而已。</p>
<p>從溪口路的門庭若市到世界聯合商塲的具體組織，充份表現了攤販們的活動能力。爲了生活，他們決不願意放棄這一行營業。如果說當局取締他們的原因是由於妨碍交通，他們願意另覓適當的地點集中一處，如果說他們是走私的漏洞，他們願意不再收受私貨，如果說他們影響到正當的商業，他們願意照樣開發票，照樣納營業稅。他們提供了這麼些條件，經過一再的請求，市府當局終於允准復業。於是，在黃金榮氏的助力之下，他們租到邑廟小世界遊藝塲的地址成立世界聯合商塲，在昨天正式揭幕了。</p>
<p>走進　燈結采的大門，踏上二樓，左右兩側一邊是主席肖像，一邊是總理遺像，滿　賀聯　　，墻角花籃遍地。想起月前被取締的狼狽情形，量非人生原如做戲？往裏去，好一派繫　　鬧氣象！一式的玻璃櫃，每三具爲一單位，每一單位都有店號有招牌，寫在一式的畏方形玻璃上，從天花板用繩索懸住。各式各樣的美貨堆滿了塞滿了玻璃櫃，人們擠來擠去，溪口路的盛況又重現於今日了。價格還是比較便宜，百粒裝的魚肝油丸祇資三千五，一千五百元可以買枝大號固齡玉，有一具櫃裏陳列着幾條亮晶晶紅紅綠綠的「玻璃領帶」，問價錢是八千元一條，夥計帶着矜誇的語氣介紹：「霞飛路上要　一萬多！」</p>
<p>全塲共有玻璃櫃二百六十四具，每三具爲一組，共爲八十八組，統受總管理處的管轄。總管理處的組織可以說「麻雀雖小五臟俱全。」有如一個小小的機關，分設五課，照像有課長，有職員。在通後門的樓梯旁邊查騐課派了兩人終日鎭守，凡是各單位的進貨都要經過這　騐明發票以免混收私貨，看樣子管理似乎相當嚴密。</p>
<p>他們的營業執照以聯合商場名義由總管理處領取，財政局抽了七萬五千元的牌照稅。一切費用均共同分攤，這一次開業的裝修費每一組負擔五十萬元左右，此後每月租金共爲三百萬元，每一玻璃櫃不過分攤到一萬多元，因此他們的開支還是比較正式商店爲節省，而且，旣取得了合法的地位，就不須再供應非法的需索，唯一的缺點就是離開中區較違而已。聽說在不久的將來，中正路上亦將有「亞洲」和「龍門」兩個類似的商塲出現了。上兩圖爲市塲大門與貨匯（本報攝）</p>

<h3>上海市渡輸公司　月內舉行創立會　擬定五年計劃增建碼頭渡輸　繁榮浦東市面吸引居民移住</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕官商合辦之上海市輪渡公司，自本年五月間，開始籌備以來，中間因幣値變動，數度影響資本總額及官股價値之估定，以致遲遲未能成立。資本額最初擬定十億元，其後增爲十二億元，最近更增爲十五億元，業經提出市參議會討論後通過，其中官股佔三分之一，計國幣五億元。以勝利後公用局所接收之前輪渡公司剩餘全部財產作抵，其餘十億元，即由交通銀行及其他十家私人銀行承募，現已開始進行。據該公司籌備主任張惠康語記者稱，月內即可舉行創立大會。</p>
<p>市輪渡公司，雖尙未正式成立，但事實上一切工作，已由籌備處積極進行，除已恢復（一）長渡淞滬綫自上海至吳淞，（二）對江東東綫，自東門路至東昌路，（三）對江其紊綫，自其昌棧至秦皇島路三綫外，對江塘　綫，自　審洩至　植，亦已於昨日復航，對江開定綫，自定海橋至麽　寺，則可於本年內恢復。此外該公司並已擬定五年計劃，分期增建碼頭及渡輪、以繁榮浦東爲目的，其計劃大綱如下：</p>
<p>三十六年擬究成者：（一）增闢南碼頭對江渡綫，（二）卡事過江綫，自蘭路至洋涇浜，先建輪一艘，陸續添造至四艘時，可日運卡車三千輛，（三）試航對江春北綫，自北京路碼頭至春江碼頭，（四）添造對江渡輪。</p>
<p>三十七年擬完成者：（一）增闢民生路對江渡綫，（二）長渡南航綫，自北京路碼頭至龍華港，（三）改進對江渡春北綫，浦西另覓適宜地點，浦東擬用日華紗廠碼頭，建造雙層渡輪，吸引浦西居民移居浦東，此項雙層渡輪如增至三艘時，每日可進客十萬人。</p>
<p>三十八年擬完成者：（一）增闢周家渡對江渡綫，（二）增闢南碼頭卡車過江綫，（三）改善各遠距離長渡綫，（四）添造長渡大輪。</p>

<p>四十年擬完成者：（一）增闢洋涇港對江渡綫，（二）增闢東門路卡車過江綫。</p>
<p>塘董綫昨復航</p>
<p>〔又訊〕浦江塘薰綫，爲浦西董家渡與浦東塘橋間之對渡綫，兩岸人烟稠密，行旅往返頻繁，市輪渡公司籌備處，主持浦江交通，早謀恢復，衹以原有董家渡碼頭，緊靠馬路，中無隙地，旅客上下至感不便，又以沿浦淤沙　積特甚，疏竣工程，過於浩大，爰經另勘公義碼頭，作爲市輪渡專用碼頭，重行設計興建。現悉該綫自積極籌備以來，各項工程，均吿完竣。碼頭新址附近，亦經委託濬浦局代爲疏竣，故於本月一日起，指派渡輪，正式復航。並聞市輪渡當局，鑒於該綫向爲浦東菜販過江要道，特將每日開航時間，盡量提早，其班次規定自晨三時起至晚八時止，每十五分鐘一班。按該綫與東東綫，並爲浦江南段重要航綫，一經恢復，對於渡浦市民，更爲便利矣。又該公司「江蘇」號輪渡經敵佔用，破壞不堪，現已修竣，下星期將加入北京路外灘及吳淞間行駛，每小時速率達十一海哩。</p>

<p>（二）童年癱瘓</p>
<p>張克成問　小兒現年五歲，三十三年三月曾患腦脊髓炎。愈後左手左脚形成癱瘓，不能動彈，同年七月，由針炙醫生診治，亦未見效，九月間赴無錫普仁醫院治療，斷爲骨髓灰白質前角炎。乃注射維他命B1三十餘針，注射時，或時發寒熱，亦未見效。三十四年春左脚略能移動，至冬間左手亦漸能舉起，惟總未能自如行動，豈知近月來行走時突現顫抖狀態，歷一分鐘即瘡。請問：（一）該症是否係羊癲瘋病？（二）有何藥物得以治癒？（三）如不治，則病狀將演變至何種程度？（四）該症至成人時期，可望好轉否？</p>

<h3>評價制度　棉布業首先響應　錫常坯布皆較本埠爲高龍頭做十萬元無貨應市</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕布市昨尚平定，晨開頗呈昂勢，但因銀根關係，採辦轉寂，客銷亦趨疲軟紡建術列開售布疋，同業頭寸，多留待准購後之用，龍頭細布做十萬元，乏貨供應，五福做九萬一千，嗶嘰小三千，紡建開售價格，細布升二千，嗶嘰站原盤，細布三A彩球，五福仙桃同爲八萬元，專配布號，青島貨五星市布，供染廠承購，與細布同價，午後市况下游，價落三五千，嗶嘰已進十萬兩，細布進九萬關。</p>
<p>棉布業公會，自前日市長召集談話，面諭抑平物價後，昨即召開現監事聯席會議，由出席市府會議之代表，申述市長意旨，各負責人咸表焦慮，當經決議，聘請業中耆宿及各方領袖份子，組織評價委員會，研討具體對策，本月六日爲該會南公所秋祭之期，同業倒有美會，聞將即席廣微意見，以謀調整需供，平衡市價，會後據某權威者語人，布價漲風，確屬不小，惟有抑平原始生產廠家之高利，减少轉輾賣買之加本，並减低利息，提早廠家出貨期間，以减輕販賣商之拆耗，便利運輸，免除標貨配貨方面之暗虧，方　有濟，且謂旬日夾中信及海關之　貨，務求標價之提高，當局對於布疋供給，未有足以安定人心之辦法，而客路實銷，又恰爲九金十銀之旺季，因外埠貨價之高，愈使本市布價，隨之升騰云，並據其透露消息，常州無錫等地紗廠家所出之坯布，原爲本市重要來源之一，近則各該地不斷漲價，上週之末，該產地二十支紗爲每件二百四十萬左右，有若干布廠須交紗一件，才可易十一磅細布二十三疋，則每疋之價，已達十萬元有餘，較之本市，愈見昂貴，又聞各染織廠在九月份內，大都存貨减少，明盈暗虧，布號則近有南陽橋及打浦橋某二家，竟爲高利貸所壓煞，及貨價上漲過速，售出後無法補進，卒至宣告閉歇，苦樂亦屬不均云。</p>

<p>公債微升</p>
<p>公債初穩後疲，北帮亦進，統丙晨開二二〇〇元，一般散戶仍被同業以漢不相關之電力公司債券，吸引上鈎，開後再升至二二五〇元以上，各方獲利爭出竟以二〇五〇元低價結束，結果較前收尚微升五〇元，甲乙升二〇元，丁種跌三〇元，統戊漲七〇元，成交達票面六百萬元。</p>
<h3>外股繼續挺秀</h3>
<p>外股買氣續盛，證券帮仍有收購，各股再上一層，但過程多盤，結果與前收相較，計怡紗紙業怡啤航業各升半成，英聯業廣鋼業微漲，會德豐籌碼甚涸，獨昂一成。</p>

<h3>美鈔籌碼見鬆··烚赤市况穩定</h3>
<p>烚赤昨晨開一一一七萬五，開後頗爲平定，曾自一一七萬升至一一七萬七，此後即有供源，並因登記配給關係，買意稍止，微告下游，十時後央行以一一一六萬五之價，配給七一條，低價曾見一一一六萬，廣帮等仍有買胃逐漸扳高，午刻曾盤高至一一一八萬五左右，午後現貨稍疲，隔日交割復告微升，結果較前收升五千，飾金念三萬二，紋銀三千元·銀元亦升至一七〇〇元左右，暗拆銀根稍鬆，息價自一角三至一角八分不等。</p>
<p>外幣極爲平穩，美鈔晨開四〇一〇元有售·開後頗爲徘徊，曾自四〇二〇元退至三九七〇元，近午金市回振，又告微挺，午刻仍站四〇〇〇元左右掙扎，午後籌碼見鬆，洋商仍有塞出，微形不振，結果較前收小二十元，港票因申電報縮至一二二元，八一〇元頗有成交，然以金鈔不佳，結果仍與前收相同，港匯則扳高爲八一〇元至八三〇元，印匯不動，英匯退至一三三〇〇元有供，美匯未有成交。</p>
<h3>投機作用顯而易見　人造絲昨竟狂瀉　塲外交易喊小近百萬</h3>
<p>人造絲昨傳日貨已有五千箱運到，市面因之跌風甚厲，較上日意小達百萬元之巨，足見前數日之瘋狂抬漲，寓有投機作用，一經當局注意，人心虛弱，不支下瀉，昨塲內未做，塲外上午最大喊四百八十五萬元，最小喊四百五十萬元，殊鮮成交，下午頗形混亂，持貨者亟需脫手，但缺乏受主，以致又喊小二十萬元。一二〇號雜牌有光，同時下降，一二〇號半光及一五〇號有光約短八九十萬元，廠絲昨亦影響傾跌，各檔貨俱小去二十餘萬元之譜，不過交易甚覺清鮮，干經去路尚好，故售價獨堅持未呈疲落，綢貨各盤，大致未更，但買戶得悉原料下跌，均存觀望，是以昨日做開甚少。</p>

<p>據三十五年七月九日代　字第22號代電，以現行關稅政策與結滙辦法，未能配合經建原則，擬具辦法三點，請採擇施行等情到部，查促進必需物品進口，抑制奢侈物品輸入，本爲復興建設應遵守之原則，而就此原則施行政令，要在詳察進口物品之種類數量，以爲合理之措施，本年進口貿易，固已漸次增距，而考察五月份江海關進口統計，其進口總值，共爲國幣八百十三億餘元，就其中建設器材，如發動機鐵道客車貨車枕木車輛零件等，工業原料如棉花五金錠塊，化學產品染料皮革橡皮等，共達六百一十一億元，約已佔進口總額四分之三，其餘四分之一，以棉布藥品油類紙類爲大宗，亦均爲適應目前經濟需要之物資，至奢侈物品已依政府頒布之禁令，嚴切取締，近並加強查緝，期絕私運，現在關於進口物品之設計事項，政府已於最高經濟委員會之下，設置輸入設計委員會，綜核籌劃，該商會所建議之第一項，加緊取締非必需品及奢侈品進口一節，應俟政府查酌統籌辦理，又原建議第二項，採用外滙等級制一節，查實施差別匯率，辦理上諸多困難，政府爲獎勵輸出，平衡進口貿易起見，外匯滙率已予調整，並特准免課出口稅在案，至原建議第三項，商約議訂務求適合整個貿易政策，在簽約以前應征集全國工商業之意見，以昭鄭重一節，應請外部核洽辦理，茲據前情，除分行外，合行電仰知照</p>

<h3>羽紗暴漲</h3>
<p>絲光羽紗，近因原料紗綫及人造絲狂漲，各檔貨價莫不暴騰，其漲風之巨，並不亞於美國麥爾登，甚且過之，更加本月份起，染費較上月份又須提高百分之一百五十，故敵方有限手貨皆不肯開價，據云照今之市價及扯合織造成本，尚多背道而馳云。</p>

<h3>市校徵收尊師金違反市參議會決議　聞市長將勒令停收</h3>
<p>本市市立學校徵收尊師金一節，各界人士均表示反對，市參議會曾爲此事，提出議案，多至七件，其理由：公立國民學校不應收取學費，法有明文。本市立小學收取尊師金，乃變相之學費，實違中央普及國民敎育之本旨。市立中學則旣有學費之規定，復有尊師金之徵收，雙重負担，尤非市民所能勝任。際此民力凋敝，失學衆多之時，政府豈能熟視無覩。幷訂定辦法三項：（一）市立小學，不再應用任何名義，收取變相之學費。（二）市立中學，不得任意收取尊師金。（三）市校敎師之底薪，可根據公平原則，由敎局酌予調整與提高。當經大會決議：請市府令市立學校停止收取尊師金，以輕市民負祖。茲聞市立各校近仍繼續徵收尊師金，實違反市參議會之決議。據悉：吳市長對此，亦表示不滿，有飭敎局勒令各校停止徵收訊。</p>
<p>〔另訊〕國民敎育，爲義務敎育，敎部疊經通令限制收費，乃本市敎育當局異想天開，所有市立國民學校，一律徵收尊師金，高小每生三萬元，初小及幼稚園每生二萬元，巧立名目，任意徽收，殊違國民敎育本旨。上月間，市參議會開會時，許多參議員，紛向市敎局副局長李熙謀，提出口頭質問，當時李副局長理屈詞窮，竟無以對。嗣經市參議會提案公決：國民學校不得徵收變相學費——尊師金。近日市立國民學校，並不遵案辦理，反强迫學生家族，限日繳付尊師金，如不繳付，即將開除學籍。據悉：敎育當局之意，市參議會決議案尙未送達以前，不妨繼續徵收尊師金，所謂「先下手爲强」。記者覺此種措施，不特違反市參議會決議，且有失敎育行政之責職。當時市參議會提議此案時，李副局長亦正列席，今竟置若罔聞，不加阻止，深爲全市市民所不滿。又訊：關於本學期尊師金，市立學校方面，已決定繼續徵收，惟公敎人員子弟，可以請求减免。聞各該市立小學已於昨日起，通知學生家長開始徵收，據大陸社記者探悉，若干敎師對學生謂：「如不繳納尊師金，將有被扣品行分數之可能」云。</p>
<h3>交大北上員生　趕辦登記手續</h3>

<h3>貸學金籃球義賽　常勝軍攻無不克　羣聲再勝巨人隊　五雨絲　卅五巨人防綫粉碎　王學哲二百五十萬購義球</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕羣聲巨人兩軍，仗義作籌募貸學金籃球賽，昨日下午八時在市體育館舉行，昨日秩序極見良好，出動軍警，固亦理由，但全塲皮椅子之全部拆去，可以容納加倍之觀衆，尤爲一成功之嘗試。比賽結果，最先一度堅張，但入後在優勝劣敗下，零聲仍以五十二對三十五輕易獲勝，上半時爲廿七對十七，亦羣聲佔先，上半時完結時，由王微君主持拍賣義球，由卅五萬開價，在競逐下，最後由學生日報社社長王學哲大善士以二百五十萬元拍去，加惠學子，殊足嘉佩，第三節完畢時，更由貸金委員會主任委員陳汝惠報吿收入，綜計收入爲一千三百十一萬六千元正。</p>
<p>表演引人入勝</p>
<p>昨巨人採人釘人制，拘決戰決心，第一節尙見緊凑，第二節起，羣聲儘量施用絕活，如祭文章陳金德蔡文華三將之虛假誘人，威脅力甚大，且對手必入其彀，可謂妙到秋毫，引人入勝，而昨賽中蔡文章又見有最大之成功，以其矮小之身段，竟能做破壞敵人手中已得之球，及用妙傳阻擋並施，無不有最神化之演出，簡直無詞以形容其特點，經七塲大戰之後，已證明羣聲隊與海上各隊，其間實有一相差階段，巨人自無法遏止其鋒芒，以後尙有對恩卡斯及華聯兩仗，我人除預測其必勝之外，極願再能領到更多之超然表演。</p>
<p>如入無人之境</p>
<p>昨雙方最初出場者，羣聲爲陳金德，陳金置，蔡文華，蔡文章，及楊人輝，巨人爲陶勃林基，浮尼克，史蒂文遜，沙司金，及凱捷密洛夫，賽前巨人獻錦旗一面，羣聲由隊長陳金德接受，八時正鳴笛開賽，陶勃林基雙手一舉首先命中，四座報以掌聲，羣聲陳隊長立刻回敬，蔡文華葫蘆依樣，四對二佔先，浮尼克托入，迫成各四，繼之陶勃林基二中，深聲文章金德亦各建一功，故造成六對六及八對八平手，第一節終，十比八，客軍領前一球。</p>
<p>再戰聲起，巨人以耶龍入代沙司金，羣聲使出混身解數陳金置蔡文華陳金德如入無人之境，分數扶搖直上，轉瞬之間，以廿二比九，大放鷂子，巨人陶勃林基振臂一呼，屢破籃圈，史蒂文遜亦有建樹，分數稍見接近，上半時完了，客軍以廿七對十七，佔得優勢。</p>
<p>投籃聯珠砲發</p>
<p>休息一過，重行交兵，羣聲以蔡連科替出楊人輝蔡文華先開紀錄，陶勃林基立還顏色，惟陶打來順手，竟又連中二球，羣聲叫停，再調人輝進塲，入代連科，金置妙中，羣聲卅七對廿四結束第三節。</p>
<p>最後一節，巨人N沙司金首中紅心，羣聲諸子，更投籃如連珠砲發，羣聲以四十二比廿六遙領，巨人力圖振作，奈羣聲緊迫不捨，四十九比卅時，巨人史蒂文遜五次犯規畢業，耶龍再度入補，迨蔡文華竄進托入，鐘聲大鳴，結果羣聲以五十二比卅五再勝巨人，七傳捷報。</p>

<h3>慶豐收浙江省收穫量可觀　廿四日杭訊　特派員儲裕生</h3>
<p>在烽烟遍地人民陷於水火之中的時候，浙江省總算是平靜而安寧的了。這個安靜的省份、是靠着晨業生產來維持她富庶的榮譽的她雖然宣稱着是糧食缺乏的省份，但大部份的人民還是賴着田稻來過生的。據說，浙江省的缺糧沒有準確的科學統計。她是以浙江全省人民二千一百萬人，每人每年吃兩石米，一共要四千兩百萬石米。每畝田以平均年產一石半來計算，則浙江省值能號稱產米二百萬石左右，這樣說來，這二百萬石，僅能解決一百萬人的生活，其餘二千萬人都是靠外米供養的了。但浙江硤石方面常常有米運往上海，嘉典，嘉善，平湖也有。溫州接近海邊，也有米糧運往上海，那麽约略計來，浙江恐只有一百多萬担米，怎樣維持全省人民的生活呢？有人說，是靠江蘇與安徽兩省供給的。當而浙江還有許多山地裏的老百姓，他們是靠雜糧，如山芋玉蜀黍麥子等——來過活的。</p>
<p>缺糧？餘糧？</p>
<p>浙江的農地有三千七百九十萬六千〇九十七畝，山地有一億〇九百十二萬九千六百〇四市畝。山地上是林木茂密，農地上農作物繁當，浙江很少有飢荒之災，所以在沒有準確的科學統計之前，我們對於缺糧與餘糧是不能加以肯定的。在浙省做過重要幕僚十餘年的夏先生吿訴我：「田稻每年的產量，都是僅憑佔計的，實在沒有準確的統計，即使省裏邊造成了精詳的圖表，發到各縣，縣裏是否有專門人才爲你調査，是一問題，再發到鄕鎭，更是摸不着頭腦了。所以要調査田稻每年的產量，必須先要土地丈量淸楚，然後由省直接派有地政農業經騐兼備的人才去査！」因此，以往所有的數字，可靠與不可靠，實在大成問題。</p>
<p>戰後更是一團糟，淸丈的册子有的已經不完整了，須得重新淸丈，很多田地荒蕪了，須得重新整理，無論如何，浙江想維持她富庶的榮譽，目前只有在農業上整理着手，要使食糧能够取得平衡的比例才行。</p>
<p>收穫量七八成</p>
<p>今年春夏之交，錢江上游，山洪暴發，淹沒了一些田禾。盛夏特節，餘杭，臨安，於潛，昌化一帶，發生了虫災。在靠天吃飯的農胞，求援無門的時候，只妄想迎神賽會來護衛他們的田禾。事情也總算順利的，水退了，虫漸漸少了，田稻還是有收成，據餘杭的省參議員某氏吿訴我，餘杭現在還有七八成之數。我去走訪建設廳田糧處，他們都說今年全省收穫量總算是豐年大槪有八成之數，少說些也有七成啊！</p>
<p>我們對於這七八成之數的收穫數字，當然也與「缺糧「或「餘糧」一樣的懷疑，但是「大致不差」，這是可以說的了。我們現在要進一步研究如何形成今年的「豐收」的呢？是不是我們政府提示了很多改進農作的方法？修築了很多水利的工程？改良了很多肥料？使農民生活或是精神上得到很多的愉快？</p>
<p>對農村多協助</p>
<p>我們細細地硏究起來，一切的一切，還是憑着農民一些千百年傳襲下來的常識，千百年傳襲下來的迷信，什麼「龍王」，祭「田公田婆」等等，完全靠着「風調雨順」而微倖獲得這豐收的。這是我們爲政者，以及城市裏的享受者應該深深地加以反省。</p>
<p>現在，有些川稻已經收起來了，有些田還沒有收起，記者曾在西南後方時創議助農割稻，而且見諸行動，獲得農胞們無比的欣喜。這時，我們相信浙江的農村，也會感着人力維艱的，許多在城市裏的軍官軍士，許多在城市裏的人士，也應該發動助農割稻。在不苛優不浪費的原則上帮助他們，他們會感着異常安慰的。本來，今天我國的都會城市，都是建築在農村上面的，如果不與晨村打成一片，讓農村崩潰，則任何都會城市都將毁滅於無形。</p>
<p>翻稻根作科耕</p>
<p>秋收以後，就要踏入寒冷的冬天，冬耕是最好的農作方法，因爲今年冬天翻耕田土，把稻根翻轉，使冬眠的蟲死在地下，稻根爛了，可以當作肥料，明年春耕也較容易，秋天一定有一個好收成。所以今年的冬耕是很重要的，我們事先要做一個很好的宣傳，事後要在各鄕舉行一個慰勞會，來安慰安慰這許多勞苦的農胞。</p>
<p>明春要硏究農具，廣放農貸。這農具在加以研究後，要推廣使用，農貸要眞正放在農胞的身上，絕對不可由中間人剝削，並且要舉辦修築各種水利，防蟲的藥粉器具也要早早預備好。倘有餘力，各縣縣長等要親到鄉下去訪間農胞，解決農胞的痛苦，或是替他們改良起居的房舍，或是替他們减少衣食交通上的困難，例如配售平價布料，食品，建築鄕村道路等。並且要舉行很多有意義的競賽，如耕牛競賽，農舍整潔競賽，農村兒童競賽，蔬菜收種鼓賽，菓品收穫競賽等。</p>
<p>以上所述，不過是農村改進事業上的一部份。我們要想有成果，其實這樣做去，也不算十分艱難。我們不可老是在城市裏兜圈子，一天到晚聽許多「代民伸訴」的話，要自已親自下鄕，親自看到實際的艱難困苦情形，才能實際的爲他們解決。</p>
<p>是的，今後要確保浙江省農田永遠豐收，地面永遠富庶，只有向科學改進的道路上走。</p>
<h3>中暹外交關係燦爛新頁　李大使呈遞國書典禮紀盛</h3>
<p>— 九月十七日曼谷航訊　本報旅行記者潔蓀</p>
<p>暹羅與我國往還，始於秦時，逮乎唐代，關係益密。清季末葉，我國多故，暹羅貢使，遂吿斷絕。旅暹僑胞，數逾三百萬名，如從血統上分析，局於純粹之暹羅人，殊不多見。位居顯要者，皆爲華僑後裔。第七世皇於民國十七年間蒞臨華校演講，曾公開承認，彼本人亦含有華人血統。暹羅今日之繁榮與發達，功績全在華僑。惟因我國，內亂外患交迫，旅外僑胞，有如無吿之孤兒，一任他人之欺侮與凌辱。鑾披汶當權期間，暹羅華僑，處境尤爲艱危。戰爭結束，我國派遣代表團來暹，幾經交涉，友好條約卒吿簽訂。邦交確立，三百餘萬華僑亦即從茲獲正常之待遇及保護。此在我外交史上，堪稱燦爛之一頁。我駐暹首任大使李鐵錚，於九月六日抵達曼谷後，積極辦理開館事宜，決議十七日舉行升旗典禮，並接暹羅方面通知，定於同日呈遞國書。</p>
<p>青天白日旗升至旗桿頂</p>
<p>是日天淸氣爽，中暹國旗，到處飄揚，凡屬華僑，莫不歡欣鼓舞。九時正，升旗典禮開始，參加此莊嚴而隆重之典禮者，有大使館全體人員，二百七十餘單位之僑團代表，二十餘華校員生及逾萬之僑衆。李大使率領卓武官獻書，孫總領事秉乾，歐陽秘書純，秦秘書珷等，步至大使館之大草坪上之旗桿前，全體肅立後，儀式於焉開始。首唱國歌，繼唱國旗歌，歌聲悠揚中，簇新之巨幅國旗，山李大使徐徐升起。靑天白日國旗升至高達十餘丈之旗桿頂端時，全體鞠躬致敬。隨由李大使致詞，略稱：今天是使館升起國旗的第一日，也就是中華民國有使節駐紮此邦的第一日。這一日，不僅在中暹外交史上開一新紀元，而且是在中暹兩民族的關係史上開一新紀元。大家都知道，暹羅是我們的主要隣國之一，我國僑胞的卜居此邦，已有悠久之歷史，千百年來，中暹兩民族，和諧相處，儼若家人，無論是在文化·經濟·血統上，甚而至於在社會生活方面，雙方都已建立了一種不可分離的關係。爲着鞏固及增進這種關係，我國政府乃於本年初派遣訪暹代表團。由本人率領來此，與暹羅政府談判，簽訂中暹友好條约。這一條約，即爲奠定中暹兩國今後親善友好的外交關係的基礎。現在，中暹外交關係的基礎雖然建立，可是，爲了促進今後中暹兩國今後更加親善友好。此有歷史價値之升旗典禮，至此宣吿完成。十時卅分，暹羅外交部禮賓司長拍廉，率同特備禮車四輛，抵我大使館迎接李大使，李大使等一行，由皇室侍從武官二人，及皇室大禮官等降階迎接。旋由大禮官陪同李使步入正殿。</p>
<p>相互的利益密切的合作</p>
<p>李大使行禮及公摩坤猜納答禮如儀後，李大使即趨前呈遞國書，並宣讀頌詞；攝政殿下：茲以中華民國特命全權大使之職分，呈遞到任國書，至感榮幸。本人奉侖敬請殿裏向暹王陛下轉達蔣主席祝頌貴國國運昌隆之悃忱，同時本人受命代表主席向貴國王室，政府及人民對前王亞南達駕崩致弔唁及深切之同情。前王德澤廣被於旅居貴國之我僑民，因而使敝國人民對其攻心崇敬，遙聞逝世，我舉國哀之。中暹兩國，素爲文化·宗敎。經濟及血統關係所聯繋，遠在史前，中國人民已移入貴國而安居於此邦。今者，華裔數逾三百萬，能與貴國和睦相處，宛如家人，此一事實，即足證明兩大民族間和諧親善之存在。誠然，中暹兩國之關係已達如此地步，實應目爲兄弟之邦。兩國間任何一國人民僑居於其他一國者，實不應以外人視之。僑遏之華人及僑華之暹人，在其各該僑居國內旅行，居住，經商，僱工及從事各種職業，將不受任何限制；而關於集會，結社，出版及其敎育子女之自由，且將永恒充分享有之，此即本人的深切期望者也。當日本攻佔暹羅時期，中國政府及其人民，不僅對於此邦人士深表同情，抑且竭其棉薄，對於爲爭取民族自由獨立而英勇鬥爭之自由泰遝動加以援助，本人能爲此言，實覺欣幸。中國政府爲表示其對貴國政府之善意，更鑒其兩國對於有關相互利益，密切合作之重要，因有派遣大使駐暹之決議。良以兩國之目標同爲和平與安全，庶吾人得以進行復興與建設工作，進而建立一較佳之世界。中國政府之外交政策，除此而外，別無目的，爲達成此項目的，敝國政府已準備與貴國政府充分合作。本人得以中華民國首任外交使節駐紮於兄弟之隣邦，實</p>
<p>爲不可多得之幸運，而引以自快。然而，本人所特感愉快者，則另有所在，本人深幸於數月前以訪暹代表團團長之身份，曾來貴國，並獲代表敝國政府簽訂中暹友好條約，使久已存在之中暹睦誼，加以條文上之確定，此則尤令本人堪以自慰者。本人充分了解即將肩負之重任，並願竭盡棉薄達成使命至最圓滿之程度，竭盡力之所及，與貴國政府合作，以增强兩國最親切之關係。此不僅爲維持亞洲和平安全所必需，抑且爲增進人頓福利所利賴者也。李大使致詞畢，攝政委員會主席致答詞，稱：本人以暹羅王之名義，接受中華民國主席任閣下爲駐暹羅王國特命全權大使之國書，深感欣幸。並對於蔣主席之頌祝盛意，謹致同樣之悃忱。暹羅國王，王室及人民對於蔣主席爲前王駕崩致弔唁之忱，至深感激。攝政委員會主席致答詞後，互相介紹其在側官員，並互相寒暄，共進香檳。至十一時十五分，典禮完畢。此中暹外交史上之新頁，在三百餘萬僑胞之心坎上，將永寗不可泯減之記憶矣。</p>

<h3>鬼市在西安</h3>
<p>— 十日西安航訊　特約記者李馳</p>
<p>「鬼市」——這個怪像一部恐怖電影名字，而毫不「雅聽」的神秘地名，在西安眞是人人皆知，比如坐黃包車，說拉到「民樂園」（「鬼市」的本名）去，還得說明一番，說『鬼市」，包管沒有錯。</p>
<p>從隴海鐵路西安站下車，到市中心經過繁盛的尙仁路，就有「鬼市」的入口。「鬼市」的「心臟」和「胚胎」，本來是小小的「民樂園」，但不知由什麽時候起，它的地區慢慢的往東發展，擴充到今天，由縱或橫量度一下，怕都在兩里路程以上，在這四五平方里之間「走馬看花」般的巡禮一番，至少得化上一兩個鍗頭。</p>
<p>天亮了　鬼去市散</p>
<p>「鬼市」是個名符其實的「市」，一句話：中外古今貨色件件齊備。隨手幾個例：論衣着，由小姐少爺的玻璃雨衣，玻璃背帶，而至從乞丐身上剝屍下來的破棉襖。論吃用，由代表「金圓國文化」的五光十色罐頭，而至飯館酒樓收回來隔宿的殘菜剩飯，都一應俱全。他如整架挺新的脚踏車，和來歷不明的汽車零件，可代表「皇軍」罪惡的「剩餘物資」如「突擊一番」，美國軍人專用的性病預防劑，一年前比金子還貴的歐洲製避孕藥，而至上海黃色的「越毒越靈」狗皮膏藥，……應有盡有。就算那以人命作資本的雅片毒品，在「鬼市」內有無鬼鬼祟祟的摸摸偸偸的交易，似乎誰也不敢擔保。</p>
<p>「市」之冠名以「鬼」，據本地的「考據家」說，因爲在於開始時有些小偸小竊，每天天未亮，齊集在這附近一帶出賣贓物，天亮了，「鬼」散「市」散，從此「鬼市」之名，一傳十，十傳百的人人皆知。後來它變成白日的舊貨市塲，地攤總會，難民唯一的「動產拍賣所」；對日戰爭勝利後，一度兼充還鄕者遺留資產的「淸理處」而「鬼市」的「發跡興家」，亦在勝利以後。起初許多游擊商人到上海·平津·河南·販些東邊貨到此零賣，後來聲勢派頭越來越大，在今天，它已成爲批發土洋雜貨，布匹碎貨的中心地。許多在外頭有挺漂亮商店門面的老闆，也要在「鬼市」內挪個攤位。最熱鬧的一段路，實僅一二十尺，兩旁攤位，就有四重而至六重之多，走進「鬼市」第一個印象是「軋」，「軋」的程度，可和交易所比美。</p>
<p>害農村貿易倒流</p>
<p>記者不曉得國內其他都市有無像「鬼市」般的畸形市集，它一天二十四小時內有不停的交易買賣，但「黃金時刻」仍在上午九時以前。諭每天進出數量，幾百攤洋雜貨布匹批發商，交收籌碼，有人估計足供戰前一個省的全年預算總額而有餘，論買主「腰纏千萬上鬼市」的，「嘸啥稀奇」。看貨論價，路角上那患砂眼快要盲了的老太婆出賣手中僅有的一件破衣，同樣認眞從事。星期日，精明的主婦有老遠的跑來買條洗臉毛巾，以减少從這裏批貨回去的小商人一重中間利潤。低級女公務員，在這天也有許多擠進來買盒香粉，肥皂之類，而她臉上先淌够汗水，旗袍也被撕縐弄髒。……這不僅是一個「市」，實實際際又是一個「世界」的縮影。記得有人形容大都市百貨公司的貨色如何齊備時說：「除了米和棺材件件有」，而「鬼市」這一區之內，却米和棺材都具備了。</p>
<p>冷靜地觀察一下這市場角落，當前經濟上許多嚴重問題，正提供出無數資料和證據。首先是看到洋貨，主要是美國貨幾個月來傾銷得驚人，當然，我們不能用上海這種尺度來衡量，但當一個混身土氣的老鄕，笑嘻嘻如獲異寶的買一把「玻璃梳子」，放進補縫過的土布袋時，記者看到了不禁打個寒噤。一個花旗橘子賣到一萬多塊錢一斤，（這就是說，兩斤半橘子換一石麥子，或一匹土布。）在「鬼市」仍有銷路，請問這是「貿易」還是『罪惡」？</p>

<h3>清江牛頭山上晉磚發現</h3>
<p>— 十日清江訊　饒惠元</p>
<p>江西淸江縣屬親湖鄕之牛頭山，題樟樹鎭約二十華里，山壤遭雨水冲洗，突露出古墓一座。據當地鄕人傳述，遜淸咸同間即已發現，太平天國軍竄境時，人多避入，誤爲古窰故也。近年經邑人徐元敬饒惠元往觀，磚載寧康年號，斷爲晋代墓穴。墓在荒山中，擴口坍露，荆棘叢生，匍伏而入，則穹形磚礦可見，壙用磚三層砌成，頗爲堅實，深约二丈，（由土面觀察）高度則因土積塞不朋，磚長三六·三公分，厚三·四三公分，（另一面無花紋或文字，厚六·六公分。）闊一八·五公分，重七·五公斤，上作寧康二年九月五日桂氏墓十一字，或雲形圖案，（磚端又作桂氏墓三字，或雲形圖案）査寧康係晋孝武帝年號，距今一千五百餘年，其確爲晋代古墓無疑。惟桂氏爲何人，則縣志無記載而不可考，（附近百里，現無桂氏其姓者）。然觀其結壙，似非尋常墓塚，且字跡樸茂，有隷楷書意，與晋碑字相倣。至壙內是否埋有碑碣及殉物，則非發掘莫知底蘊。墓穴附近多荒塚，其磚露出土面，偶得一二完整者，則雲形雙錢圖案及蔴布紋，淸晰可觀，似皆爲唐宋以前之葬物。（近日又在晋墓附近發現初平年號之碍，惟字跡不若晋磚之情晰，似爲三國時之漢磚）。現正進行發掘，或能搜集有關考據之文物，亦未可知。如此，則不難供專家作考古之硏究。</p>

<h3>擴展中東勢力　蘇聯遭遇挫折</h3>
<p>— 譯自美國世界日報　南</p>
<p>中東是英美和蘇聯角逐的塲所。三個月以前，西方國家的處境非常不利，但是現在局勢已經改觀，蘇聯在中東方面擴充勢力的計劃，遭遇到了極大的挫折。</p>
<p>至於雙方角逐的目標，其一是爭奪石油資源，另一是確保軍事上的安全。</p>
<p>誰都知道在波斯灣周圍各國的山地和沙漠之下，蘊藏着全世界三分之一的石油資源，而爲各國所注目。</p>
<p>根據目前的情形，美國的石油公司控制着該方面全部石油蘊藏量的百分之四十二。它們控制沙地阿剌伯油藏全部，伊拉克油藏的一部以及柯歲特油藏的一半。</p>
<p>英國的石油公司控制着該方面全部石油蘊藏量的百分之五十。由英政府控制的英伊油公司在伊朗南部佔有廣大的油田。此外英國在伊拉克和柯崴特也有幾塊油田。至於剩餘的部份，則在法荷兩國資本家的手中。</p>
<p>蘇聯在中東方面並無油田，但是可能獲得伊朗北部廣大油區的　　　。</p>
<p>中東油田區　重要性日增</p>
<p>中東的石油，對於聯合國在第二次世界大戰中獲勝曾盡極大的作用，當今世界其他地方的舊油田產量日减的時候，中東油田的重要性更其與日俱增。</p>
<p>中東在軍略上的重要性，也是非常顯明的。英國爲了英軍不久即將撤離埃及，所以必須在中東找尋新根據地。蘇彝士運河是英帝國的咽喉，目下由英國海軍巡邏的波斯灣，是通往印度洋的孔道和世界貿易的通路。</p>
<p>蘇聯和伊朗有一條很長的共同國境綫，離伊拉克也祗有一天的路程。蘇聯對於寇特族，亞塞爾拜然民主份子，伊朗政治和阿刺伯動向的興趣，使她的勢力深入這個以產油聞名世界的區域。</p>
<p>由於石油資源和軍事安全等因素，中東最近的動態益見其重要。現在且把蘇聯在這方面所遭遇的挫折，簡單地叙述在後面：</p>
<p>在伊朗方面，　蘇的左翼政黨逐漸在失却力量。不久以前杜台黨還氣慨不可一世，帮助蘇聯獲得伊朗北部的油權以及伊朗亞塞爾拜然省的自治權。杜台黨自信在未來的選舉中可以獲得勝利，進而控制議會。該黨控制的職工會甚至想直接打擊英國，在英國所有的油田方面號召罷工。</p>
<p>但是自此以後，情形就改變了。阿剌伯徒衆在英國慫恿之下，擊破了罷工運動，殺死了重要的職工會領袖。當地的省政府派出軍隊，將剩餘的罷工領袖送入監獄。德黑　政府不久就把杜台黨的領袖放出，可以他們已經無法再在油公司控制地區活動了。</p>
<p>對於左　份子最嚴重的打擊，就是總理蘇丹納所組新民主黨的成功，該黨的黨綱聽上去似乎比杜台黨還要富有革命性，但是原來的保守份子都投向新黨的旗幟之下，目的想借此剝弱蘇聯支持的杜台黨。因此，議會選舉遲遲仍未舉行，日子愈是遷延得久，杜台黨成功的機會也愈少。</p>
<p>對於蘇聯，有一件事是非常重要的，就是她在伊朗北部所獲得的油權，必須於十月二十四日由伊朗議會予以批准，不然以前的協定，就會成爲一頁廢紙。目下伊朗還沒有議會，假如選舉不迅速舉行，到十月二十四日是否會產生議會的。</p>
<p>中東能否安定　尙在未定之天</p>
<p>英國政府在解決油田罷工之後，不久就發表一聲明，力言伊朗石油資源的重要，並且命令精銳的印度第四師自印度調往伊拉克的巴斯拉，離伊朗阿巴頓油田僅三十英里，由此可見英國關心的一斑了。</p>
<p>在伊拉克方面，勞工糾紛時常使莫蘇爾和基庫克油田的生產間斷。伊拉克政府在英方指導之下，最近解決了一次罷工。在罷工解決前曾有若干死傷，但是工人的要求改善生活情形，已予以若干滿足。此外，伊拉克政府正在逮捕反政府份子，具有反共產主義的意義。</p>
<p>在沙地阿剌伯方面，勞工糾紛比較少，人民也比較最原始，但是國王伊本沙特却已發表命令，禁止共產黨活動，藉以防患未然。該國最困難的問題是經濟問題，但是美國進出口銀行已經借給她一千萬美元，這可以促使沙地阿刺伯對美國忠誠。</p>
<p>埃及也已經採取措置　壓共產黨活動。許多散發煽動性宣傳品的嫌疑犯已被監禁起來，未被監禁的已經接到停止宣傳的警吿，不然就得離開埃及國境。</p>
<p>土耳其最近選舉新內閣，其中右翼保守份子佔極大優勢，以反對蘇聯要求聞名的外長　加。依然留任。</p>
<p>上述種情形，說明英蘇在中東方面的鬥爭，最近使蘇聯的勢力遭遇了挫折，英美暫時阻止了蘇聯在這方面的擴張。但是中東局勢是否能持久穏定，則尙在未定之天，鑒於蘇聯對中東的處心積慮已有很久的歷史，她在一有機會的時候就會實行反擊的。</p>
<p>英美和蘇聯在中東方面勢力的消長，對於世界和平具有重大的關係。</p>
<h3>美國十位專家檢討　三次大戰可能性</h3>
<p>— 外交記者法明茲著本報編澤室專譯稿</p>
<p>「第三次世界大戰會不會發生？」這是世界各國人民大衆，都迫切希望獲得一個答案的問題。美國合衆社特派員外交問題專家法朗茲曾經和政府及外交界方面的專家十人作非正式的談話，他們的日常工作和對蘇關係是有密切聯繫的。現在我們把他綜合各方意見後所獲得的結論，迻譯在後面。據他調查的結果，第三次世界大戰的可能性還很遙遠。國際方面最近的趨勢，正在走向世界均勢方面去，代替了十九世紀時代的歐洲均勢，但是强大的經濟社會勢力正在發揮其効能，使國際間的爭執限於外交方面而不致動武</p>
<p>當前最重要的問題，莫過於美蘇關係了，同時這個問題也最複雜，就是最有能力的外交家也不敢遽下斷語，但是他們都認爲目前美蘇間的種種困難是由於華盛頓與莫斯科間在戰後期間彼此缺乏認識和瞭解所致。</p>
<p>目前巴黎和會還在開會，有許人以爲在會塲中爭得面紅耳赤適足以使各國間意見的對立更其尖銳化，但是具有外交經濟的人都覺得把悶在葫蘆裏的問題在大庭廣衆中暢談一番對於問題的解決不無裨益。另有一部份人則認爲各國問對於爭執的問題如能用照會的方式來代替滔滔不絕的演說，或者更有効果，因爲這樣可以使工作緊湊，不必枉費許多無謂的口舌了。</p>
<h3>美蘇之間</h3>
<p>— 南</p>
<p>劃着一條鴻溝</p>
<p>美蘇之間爲了兩國經濟原則和制度的不同，似乎劃着一條鴻溝，但是爲了彼此間迫切的需要，可能有長時期的相互適應，甚至合作。</p>
<p>據外交家的理解，史達林在今日的世界上佔有堅强的地位，因爲由於第二次世界大戰的結果蘇聯在領土和勢力上的收穫極大，但是這些收穫，大部份是旣成事實而不是合法性的。所以對於蘇聯最有利的態度。就是不斷地按步就班地進行國際性的談判。</p>
<p>至於英國，爲了　帝國內部的許多困難問題，對於世界命運的決定比較上處於次要的地位，許多觀察家相信世界的將來，大部份將由美蘇的關係來決定。</p>
<p>美國務卿貝爾納斯在斯都伽脫地所發表的主張德國統一的演說，爲硏究國際問題者所一致贊同，因爲其中保證美國將不斷努力來爭取歐洲經濟的復興和世界的和平。從好的方面看，貝爾納斯的觀點，可能成爲四强外長會議討論德國問題的新議程；從壞的方面看，貝爾納斯的主張至少也可以促進西歐各國在經濟方面的合作。</p>
<p>至於歐洲的事態是否會引起新戰爭的問題，則有兩種答案：一部份人直截爽快地說「不會，」另有一部份人則認爲「至少在五年之內不會。」第一種見解是根據下面的說法，就是　國非　攻擊決不致發動戰爭，蘇聯可　不必　戰爭的危險而在世界中增强其地位。至於第二種的見解，是　　蘇聯目前在技術上還不堪一戰，但是將來假如　不能經過正常的辦法達到目的，也許會出　戰爭。</p>
<p>時事評述</p>
<h3>一夕數驚的世界</h3>
<p>— 儲玉坤</p>
<p>希臘內亂在擴大中　海峽風雲又在動盪</p>
<p>這幾個星期以來，各國政治外交家，莫不危言聳聽，不是說新的戰爭危機，已在醞釀之中；就是說兩個世界的對立，已不可避免了。這些言論，使我們的神經，都緊張到極點。但是史太林却向星期泰唔士報記者發表談話，表示不信戰事又將再起，不啻給世人服了一帖淸凉劑，立即淸醒了許多。使國際間的政洽空氣，也頓時澄淸了。</p>
<p>目前並無戰爭危機</p>
<p>史太林於九月廿四日接見英國星期泰晤士報記者，發表書面談話，他率直表示：（一）贊成美軍退出中國；（二）目前並無戰爭危機；（三）獨覇原子能秘密，足以危及世界和平；（四）希望加强英蘇文化關係。</p>
<p>這個談話在報上發表後，立即引起各國興論界的良好反響。蘇聯人士以爲，史太林說沒有戰爭國際上就不會有戰爭，所以覺得非常快慰。此在英美方面，也是如此；華萊士認爲史太林的談話，足使全世界千萬愛好和平的人士頓感無限希望，而認爲史太林已承認共產主義與資本主義可以平行不背。此在英國，更認爲史太林的談話，是戰後唯一可以安定人心的因素。但是在我們看來，在史太林的談話裏，包藏着親英反美的微妙作用。</p>
<p>蘇聯提出中國問題</p>
<p>蘇聯在巴黎和會節節失敗，未能控制住和會，十分懊喪，因此便想借題發揮；先利用希阿兩界邊界衝突，對於英軍留駐希境，大肆攻擊；但到了安全理事會席上，蘇聯代表葛羅米柯孤掌難鳴，又未能發揮其所採取的外交攻勢；於是又改變方向，利用中國問題，向美國發動攻勢。他的提案內容要點有三：（一）美軍留駐中國，已造成足以引起國際磨擦之事態；（二）美國駐軍現正干涉中國·氷島·曁拉丁美洲各國之內政；（三）中國局勢並非祇有關中美兩國，應請安全理事會予以注意。</p>
<p>中國也是安全理事會的常任理事之一，中國問題唯有自己能解決，即使要訴諸安全理事會，中國代表也自能提出，又何必勞動葛羅米柯越俎代庖呢？他這樣提出，將置中國於何地呢？所以中國外交當局，立即聲明，美軍留駐中國，係出於中國的請求，並不危害和平。美國代理國務卿克萊頓也作同樣的聲明：美軍駐在中國，並未引起不安。因此蘇聯的建議，也就被安全理事會否決了。</p>
<p>希王返國內亂又起</p>
<p>希臘自公民投票決定由國王返國復辟後，政府與左派的衝突，就一發不可收拾，到了最近，希臘內戰更到了嚴重的關頭；希臘內閣總理蔡爾達里斯於廿五日向報界發表談話稱：「戰爭已由國外移至希臘，外國勢力，欲利用混亂局面，以達到取得愛琴海出口之目的。」由此可知希臘內亂的嚴重性。英國也以希臘局勢不靖，不欲將其駐軍撤退回國，並與美國共同決定採取堅定立塲，似乎不惜被捲入希臘內戰的漩渦，頗有使希臘淪西班牙第二的可能。</p>
<p>但是希臘局勢正在危急的時候，國王喬治二世突然返國復辟了。現內閣已辭職，再由前任總理另組新閣，不久也就可以吿成了。</p>
<p>和會決定加緊工作</p>
<p>巴黎和會定於十月十五日以前結束，各委員會均須加緊工作，英美法蘇四國外長，乃決定和會加緊工作的辦法：（一）和會定於十月五日舉行全體大會，對於久懸未決的各項問題，當有所決定。各委員會並應分別向大會報吿工作經過。（二）和會至遲於十月十五日舉行全體大會，將各項和約，提付表決。（三）四國外長會議應於十月五日舉行，將和會所獲結果，加以研究：務須於十月十五日以前，完成各項工作。（四）至聯合　大會開幕時，四國外長會議之工作，如若尙未完成，則四國外長應前往紐約，在聯合國大會最初數日繼續工作。</p>
<p>從此各委員會便加緊工作，但是欲速則不達，特里雅斯特區問題，始終無法解決。廿八日對義委員會通過了義南兩國邊界，南國代表猶以拒簽和約相威脅，蘇聯還從旁予以支援，所以預料和會，很難如期完成其工作。</p>
<p>海峽風雲又趨急緊</p>
<p>關於土耳其的　　　尼爾海峽問題，在國際會一度引起軒然保大然，　即漸趨平息；但到了九月廿八日，蘇聯第二次照會土耳其政府，要求蘇土共同防衛海峽地帶，土耳其的態度仍堅定如管，決不懾於蘇聯的威脅而有所改變，並爲應付萬一起見，也在那裏動員軍隊。所以海峽風雲色變，又爲世人注意的焦點了。</p>
<h3>美蘇兩國新防綫　在遙遠寒冷的北極圈</h3>
<p>— 合衆社特派員高爾紐約專電本報編譯室特譯　　南</p>
<p>遙遠而寒冷的北極圈，目前已經成爲美蘇兩國的國防重鎭。隨着新軍器的層出不窮，自北極區根據地出發的長距離轟炸機，可以威脅歐亞美三洲的一切軍略要點，這在十九世紀時代的人，或許是夢想不到的。目前美蘇兩國對於彼此在北極圈的行動，都在密切注意，尤其是阿拉斯加和西比利亞東部的動態。</p>
<p>阿拉斯加和西比利亞極東部相隔僅白令海峽一衣帶水，堪察加半島和阿留申羣島差不多把東西兩半球聯繫在一起，目前這些地方正在變成美蘇國防的前哨，龐大的軍事設置正在那裏建立起來。</p>
<p>蘇聯積極建立　機塲公路港口</p>
<p>根據各方的報吿：蘇聯方面在此一地區已經做的，有下列幾點：（一）在彼得羅柏符洛夫斯克建立大飛機塲一處，可以容納像飛行堡壘一樣大的轟炸機，該地離美國的最前哨根據地阿圖島僅四百九十英里；（二）在彼得羅柏符洛夫斯克港周圍飛機塲之後和該區腹地闢地若千英畝，建築棧房和營房；（三）疏濬阿文却灣的入口處可容大船開入；（四）改善堪察加半島西岸自巴爾歇萊茨克通往彼得羅柏符洛夫斯克的公路，使它成爲在各種氣候下都能使用的軍用大道，此外在半島南端，還有一條輔助公路，從巴爾歇萊茨克通往洛柏脫卡角。</p>
<p>美國得到了這些消息，當然不會說明怎樣得到的。但是在搜集情報方面，蘇聯也不見得不積極。在阿岡島上空，每星期中有四五天可以探測到有蘇聯飛機在飛行。蘇聯方面的非正式聲明，說是爲了觀察氣象。這種說法，聽上好像也很有道理，因爲在阿圖島上空差不多終年有霧，因此在空中是不容易視到地面上的情形的。</p>
<p>但是現在有雷達，靠了雷達就可以測出地面上的設置，例如美國人就極少看見蘇聯的飛機，但是靠了雷達的信號，知道的確有飛機在飛行。蘇聯的在阿圖島上空飛行，是一種片面的行動，因爲蘇聯是不准美國或者任何其他國家的飛機飛近蘇聯的領土二百里之內的。</p>
<p>蘇聯方面已經宣布在西比利亞進行試騐，這地方，像阿拉斯拉的大部份一樣，是終年爲霜雪所掩蓋，堆積得非常深厚的。蘇聯正用雪　在淸除霜雪。假如他們的試騐成功，那麽，西比利亞的大片荒地，可以作爲軍事和商業之用。</p>
<p>假如這一點在西比利亞辦得到，那麼在阿拉斯加也是辦得到的。　　　辟之也，今日軍略重鎭</p>
<p>美蘇兩國活動　軍事經濟並重</p>
<p>蘇聯集中力量開發西比利亞，是在日本投降前不久才開始的。彼得羅柏符洛夫斯克居民九萬，並未受戰爭的影響。在美國參加抗日戰爭之後，華盛頓曾經敦促莫斯科，將彼得羅柏符洛夫斯克爲遠東的第二港口，以防日本襲擊海參崴，當時蘇聯方面不表興趣。但是在日本投降前不久，蘇聯却努力使彼得羅柏符洛夫斯克變成根據地，截至目前，可以說頗有成就，船隻來往，運輸頻繁，這個不凍的海港，是遠北最良好的港口之一。</p>
<p>華盛頓官方指出：蘇聯方面這些活動，不能單從軍事觀點去觀察。戰爭不祗是兒戲，而是要使國家和她的人民生活和繁榮，蘇聯曾經屢次向世界說她要成爲一個大商業國，他們在西比利亞進行的計劃，同時也抱有開發這方面廣大豐富土地的目的。</p>
<p>美國軍界承認：蘇聯有在其本國領土上進行設防工作的權利。蘇聯在西比利亞方面的行動，是和美國在阿拉斯加方面的行動，出於同一目的。</p>
<p>所以美蘇在北極區一帶的活動，顯然有軍事和經濟兩重意義。</p>
<p>國際風雲人物</p>
<h3>史達林無帥　他說：「我並不神秘」</h3>
<p>— 佐祺節譯雜誌文摘</p>
<p>在最近國際間所發生的糾紛中，差不多每一件都與蘇聯有關，我們要瞭解蘇聯，先要認識蘇聯政府幕後的大權獨　者—史達林的種種。</p>
<p>在實　馬克斯主義理想的蘇聯，最奇怪矛盾的是：馬克斯認爲歷史並不是英雄個人所能造成的，而完全是靠羣衆團體的力量；但是，再沒有一個國家比蘇聯那樣地祟拜英雄偶像了，也沒有一個國家的國民，視他們的元首如此神聖而秉　權力之大像史達林那樣。</p>
<p>的確，史達林掌握　蘇聯一切的黨政軍大權，他擁有一支世界上最强大的私人軍隊；因此，與古代的帝皇一樣，輕易是很難見到他的，他即使在邀宴外賓的時候，常低頭不看客人的面孔，客人自然也很難看淸他的面貌了。在對德戰事的幾年中，他除了到德　蘭去過一次外，就從來沒有出過國門，而且，他不常發表談話，美前總統羅斯福大約每星期要發表二次談話，史達林却一年至多二次。</p>
<p>史達林統治蘇聯的簡史是這樣：過去他曾經費了三十五年的時間去和統治階級爭鬥，曾經被沙皇放逐過五次，他消磨了整個的靑年時期策劃着革命工作；果然，十月革命後，沙皇被推翻了，但是，沙皇以前禁止言論自由，集會自由的制度，至今依舊存在，這難道是史達林所領導下的蘇聯，實行民主政治嗎？還有，當一九二九年，托洛斯基被革命軍放逐以後，史氏正式一躍而爲黨國的第一流要人，於是。他爲貫澈他個人的主張起見。用他的力量去殺害了許多過去與他同生共死的同志，直到一九四〇年，史達林方才結束了他的奮鬥，這一年，正巧托洛斯基遭人暗殺。</p>
<p>據說，史達林有兩大願望：報復私仇和擴展蘇聯。第一個目標已經達到，第二個目標也在這一次對軸心國戰爭勝利中獲得成功。</p>
<p>史達林很明瞭而且熟悉德國人的性格—懦弱與服從，他曾經很得意地告訴別人：</p>
<p>「在革命時期中，我和幾個德國籍的同志，到却勞登堡車站去乘車到某地去秘密開會，但是，我們走得太遲了，幸而收票人沒有注意，被我溜過了月台，幾個德國同志却不敢這樣做，最後，終算趁着紛亂的機會，他們方才被我拉了過來。幸運地趕上了這班火車。」</p>
<p>現在，史達林要在德國人的個性上取得報酬了，德國人是不難被蘇聯的敎育所迷眩感化的。像普魯士，薩克森，紹林吉亞，梅格稜堡的一部—差不多半個德國，都　蘇聯管制了；勝利的戰果不僅　些，半打以上的歐洲小國家沒有經過任何革命，就實行了共產主義，他眼看數十年來的努力，今天果然得到了收穫。</p>
<p>美前戰時生產局長納爾遜有一次訪謁史達林，我們就可以看出史達林對美國所取的態度，當時納氏問戰後蘇聯需要些什麽，史氏立刻用筆在紙上寫着：五萬輛機動車，可見得蘇聯不過是將美國當作一個機械方面的來源罷了。</p>
<p>史達林對於帝俄時代所沒有盡到的野心，可以說完全實現了，有一次，某記者謂史氏與彼得大帝一樣成功，他聽後大笑，其實，他們之間有一個很大的區別：彼得渴望學習歐洲人的一切；史達林却希望去敎育歐洲人。</p>
<p>還有一次，當某記者說到命運時，史達林說：「不，我不相信命運，只有古希臘人才會去相信我們的生命是上帝賦予的，我不是一個神秘的人，假使你奇怪爲什麽我能在革命中不死，我能回答你，任何一個人可能坐在這個椅子上，和我一樣。」但是，數十年來，他却在竭力防止任何人來霸佔這個寳座。</p>
<p>「我是列寗的學生，」他自己這樣的說，但是，每個人都覺得這只是一句自我宣傳的話罷了，看一個蘇聯作家的話：「當他死後，我們一定要造一個　墓，此列寗的還要偉大。」</p>

<p>原來自然造成彌天大綱，誘惑人人入　，先呌你享受結婚的權利，再呌你盡生兒育女的義務。結婚而無子患，豈非白享一世的權利？許多人不度德量力，在這年頭，弄得兒女成羣，等到發覺這重祖不好挑時，才設法打胎，究研勞而無功的節制生育法，降低自己的生活程度，已是噬臍莫及了。有了子息，太太就一定分了心，不能專門侍奉你，這還不算，你好潔，大褂子上常被拆爛污；你好靜，床上有個夜啼郞；你心愛的書上，不愁無人在上面練習書法；你得意的花草，常被連根拔起；孩子們身體不適，比自己害病還難受；孩子死了，同樣會有子夏喪明的危險。你生活要放浪一下，他們是你無形中的監視人，有孩子的家庭，父母是無言論自由的。</p>
<p>你不生育，他不生育，這民族豈不是要變成美洲的印第安人第二，有被淘汰的危險嗎？這無須担憂，自有「不孝有三，無後爲大」的那班迷不知返的人負責到底。</p>
<p>獎勵生育的提倡者，差不多都是頸等野心魔王。日，德，意的法西份子，曾剝奪了人民的一切權利與自由，何以只歡喜你生兒子？何以希特拉那傢伙强迫別人生育，他自己到臨死才結婚？今日假如還有一種英雄們，獎勵寡婦生子，處女生子，强迫尼姑結婚，你還不明白他們一鼻孔出氣的用心嗎？</p>
<p>沒有兒子，不會被人家談笑缺德嗎？放心放心，陳摶老祖的心相篇上說得明白：「公平正直雖無子息死爲神。」所以無兒子的人。照常可以做菩　的。第二次世界大戰傷亡的人數，幾達一萬萬，單行排列，可繞地球四周，他們誰不是人家的好兒子？所以依照現代的觀點說，應該是：「積德者無子。</p>
<p>細考古今來的大人物，多子的很少，釋迦，耶穌，摩西，摩哈麥特，他們有多少兒子？孔子只有個早夭的獨子，孟子的兒子我說不出是誰，關羽，岳飛，都沒有嫡親的兒子，他如中外的英雄烈士，學者高人，如文天祥，史可法，顧炎武，鄭所南，林和靖，康德，笛卡爾……（近代名人恕不多舉）他們的兒子在那裏？</p>
<p>假如人眞要　笑你絕後，你一句話便可抵抗：一壞瓜子多。一世界上第一流的動植物是很難留種的，譬如鳳凰稀有，麻雀最多；　麟稀有，老鼠最多；靈芝稀有、野草最多；以此類推，醴泉稀有，海水最多；金玉稀有，爛泥最多；……無子者大可引爲自慰。</p>
<p>「養兒防老」更是夢話，他自己的老婆還孝敬不了，養你？</p>
<p>「揚名　顯父母」，你不要藉兒子出出名吧？這更是謬論。我只看見揚名聲顯兒子，因爲我們只知名人的公子，不甚知道他封翁的。</p>
<p>不過我也佩服不知那個人的話，兒子如眉毛，有之無大用，無之惹人注目，如此而已。</p>
<h3>秋</h3>
<p>— 老丹</p>
<p>光陰如駛，夏季輕烟似的飄然地飛跑了，時光不留，她是多麽的無情呢，無怪人的生命也是這麽飄忽了。</p>
<p>長夏已去，今又是　捲西風黃花瘦的季候了。早上晚來，都帶點寒意。天空的輕雲，階前的落葉，都充分地報導這是秋到人問了。金風送爽，桂子飄香，又怎得不相信這是暮秋呢。</p>
<p>秋心，便是愁，當那秋風蕭索地掠過你的臉龐時候，她就是給你一個暗示像是吿訴你當惋惜那容易逝去的時光，時光一去，是永久不可再來的。常那樹上飄落幾片黃葉，有時竟然正是打着你的身上，也許會使你感到自己的生命，又何嘗不是像她這樣的零落與飄忽。晚上郊外的草坪，路旁，斷斷續續的發出了幾聲的幽抑蟲啾，聽了，又怎能不使你回憶到鄉間田間的蛙鳴。總之，秋的一切氣象，都是給人們無限的悵惘與回憶，尤其是最容易觸起的，就是遊子們遠離鄕井憶親念友的幽思。</p>
<p>秋，我實在有點兒怕，我怕她帶來給與人們不少的憂　，惹起人們時刻的追戀着過去，同時　　着那　茫的未來。雖然回憶，或許是有相當意義的，來來也許是光明的。可是在人生的歷程上，正如泡影曇花。那末，人事的變遷，一切的轉變，有誰能够　　　　的呢．</p>
<p>有人說，人生的快樂與悲哀，全是從每個人自已的心　而　　，　　墝由心　。這句話，　　　　　很有兜由。不　、爲什麽一般的人，偏偏要自尋煩惱，而不能够從心所欲的產生一個快樂美滿的人生？我想，他總會這樣子的來解答你：「談何容易」？</p>
<p>「秋風悉索，寒蟬抱樹而無聲；夜月悽凉，哀雁驚霜而獨語。世無公論，誰識鳥之雌雄？人有戒心，莫知命之朝夕」！在萬感交集之下，不禁使我回憶起某君的幾句駢體文來，愈尋味　覺得這是寄託幽深的應時話。値這微風拂拂，已凉天氣未寒時，執筆寫幾句來略抒胸臆，也許這就受了秋氣的所感吧。</p>
<h3>論兒童文學作品</h3>
<p>— 陸少卿</p>
<p>兒童文學創作，是一件吃力不討好的工作。但是兒童文學創作、在敎育年一代的敎育意養上，却具有重要的地位。高爾基曾寫了「俄羅斯的童話」，魯迅先生曾翻譯了不少兒童文學作品，例如「　」「桃色的　」。這些世界的大文豪都對於兒童文學極端的重視。尤其是魯迅先生，他眼見了還在毒素連環圖畫時代的中國兒童讀物，不禁大聲疾呼：「救救孩子吧！」這句話已成爲警惕由國作家們的一句警語。然而在十多年後的今天，中國的兒童讀物到底有沒有多大的進步呢？優秀的兒童文學作品到底產生了幾部呢？對於這句問話的回答，却還是令人寒心。</p>
<p>但是惟一可以安慰我們的，畢竟還有一些作家，他們不甘坐視於中國的天眞的少年們往神仙劍俠的連環圖畫裏鑽，他們提起了筆，嘗試着新型的兒童文學的創作。</p>
<p>於是我們讀到了張天翼的童話，賀宜的童話，范泉的童話。</p>
<p>關於范泉先生的童話，我僅使讀到了兩個單印本和兩個短篇，單印本是創作的「哈巴國」，翻譯的「黑白記」，短篇是連續分載在「少年世界」半月刋上的「幸福」和「歡喜聽唱歌的石磨」。</p>
<p>「黑白記」是一册翻譯的長篇童話，原著者是朝鮮作家張赫宙，取材於中國蒙古的傳說。全書的內容寫達兩個截然不同的個性：黑）寳和白寳弟兄倆我不懂得日文，因此不能把譯本和原本對照，但是就譯者的譯筆上看，我們看不出這是一個譯本，譯者很能懂得兒童的心理，把句法的組織配合兒童的閱讀能力和閱讀興趣，再加陳烟橋先生的明朗有力的插圖，所以這是一册近年來不易多見的兒童文學作品。</p>
<p>但是使我更爲驚歎的倒是他的創作童話「哈巴國」。「哈巴國」是一部現實的作品。從作品的開始一直到末尾，作者緊緊把握住兒童的心理，完全用兒童的口吻烘托出故事的全部。故事用哈巴國國王的大鼻子作爲終索，作爲發展故事的機鈕，而彫刻的幾個人物個性，也是非常突出，給予讀者深刻的印象。作者運用了幽默的風格，非常可笑的說法，來描寫非常嚴肅的事件，非常現實的故事。全書的敍述可謂一氣呵成，緊張到了極點，處處捉住鬥爭的塲面，令人越看越感興味，越想很快地讀完全書。所以無論在主題和表現的手法上，這部作品是成功的。</p>
<p>對於范泉先生的兒童文學創作，可以歸納到幾個特點。</p>
<p>第一·取材的現實性。這從「哈巴國」和「幸福」的兩個創作童話裏可以看得出來。作者不願意兒童們去做阿魔思漫遊「奇境」，作者不願意兒童們隔離現實，却相反的，他要把「現實」帶給兒童，讓兒童們也曉得這個世界的善惡，眞和假，可愛和可憎。</p>
<p>第二。把握兒童心理。這是兒童文學創作的基本條件，一篇作品的是否屬於兒童，抑係成人，分別就在這裏。而要把「現實」帶給兒童，僅用成人的口吻寫出，兒童是不會接受的。范泉先生在表現手法上却很能顧到這一點，這是他的成功處。</p>
<p>第三，富有敎育意味。原來兒童文學創作便是灌輸兒童新的知識，啓發兒童新的思想。「哈巴國」和「幸福」，都含有豐富的現實的知識，但這些知識不是敎條，而是純粹用啓發式敎育手法表現出來的文藝形式，這也是値得我們稱頌的地方。</p>
<p>但在這裏，我也不能不指川兩個可能招致的危險的傾向：第一，幽默而偏向無意義的滑稽，這是萬萬走不得的路。張天翼的作品也幾乎有這種可怕的趨勢。第二，句子的結構過於離有取巧，因爲兒童是富於模做性的，他們如果模倣了這樣的句法在作文課裏寫出，不是鬧了很大的笑話嗎？</p>
<p>但在兒童文學作品寥若晨星的現在，在神仙劍俠的迎環圖畫充斥街頭的今天，我要推薦范泉先生的兒童文學作品給目前關心兒童文學的成人和兒童們！</p>

<h3>寂寞之窗</h3>
<p>— 蘇姍</p>
<p>窗，帶給我小室裏太幽穆的明輝。一幅細膩的圖案，構組成我多少年代的　樓綺夢。</p>
<p>以前我不知道什麽是孤獨，但自從有一個人在我心底烙下影子後，我便有了孤獨，和太深的寂寞。</p>
<p>有修竹裝飾了窗檻，裝飾了我寂寞的心，更裝飾了我仲夏夜之夢。</p>
<p>從深秋到嚴冬，嚴冬又帶來了春曉。我那寂寞的窗，永遠映照那燕子的南來，南來復北歸，楓葉煊染了窗畔，却又被冬日的雪和霜洗刷了一遍，二遍。八月裏的明月，把窗和人全都浸在銀河裏，浸透了我寂寞的心。偶而有小鳥踱過，却又撲撲地匆匆而去，依售帶不走寂寞。</p>
<p>「靑燈照壁人初睡，冷雨敲窗被未溫，」寂寞的人兒呵，始終祗是「夏　清兮盡不暮，冬釭凝兮夜何長！「從此我體味着離夢的躑躅，別意的飛揚，心底被烙下了影子，却永遠衹是寂寞。寂寞·寂寞。</p>
<h3>多熟悉些形式</h3>
<p>— 綠素</p>
<p>魯迅所以對社會有着這樣深刻潑辣的諷刺與指摘，完全是依賴他雜文的形式而發揮完成的。馬耶柯夫斯基未來派的詩的形式，表現了他的奔放激盪的情緒。小仲馬寫茶花女，先是小說而後是戲劇，這用兩種不同的形式來敍述本事的先後枝節，才有了進出。「阿Q正傳」藉着作者奇妙的心理描寫方法來敍述阿Q的精神勝利，但由田漢許幸之等所改編成的劇本，在舞台上須借旁的角色來給他描寫，就不免失敗。這就證明了形式與內容的不可分割性。</p>
<p>形式與內容的關係如此之大，作爲作家的即必須藉用多種形式來發揮內容。作家對某一種形式特別見長熟悉當然不錯，但若能熟悉多種形式，即有許許多多良好題材，即不致在作家手邊溜過，亦不致因了形式的硬塞而使內容大加遜色。</p>
<h3>叢竹（　虛齊藏）</h3>
<p>— 明·唐寅</p>
<h3>一寸山河一寸血　　50</h3>
<p>— 葉勁風</p>
<p>到了××飯店W君的總部，我見鼎元有些疲倦，便勸他留在車子裏，我可以代他致謝W君，　元答應了我剛踏進W君的屋子，W君正握着秘密電話機話筒，一見我進了房，便立刻把電話放下，神色已經變了，態度却很鎭定。</p>
<p>「對不起！」他很愼重的說着，「我剛打電話請您來，本來要吿訴您一個不大佳的消息—紀耀羣小姐，同虎城兩人，通州的事，本很順手，今天早晨六點多鐘，忽然收到那邊密報，說他們兩人忽然失踪，先是虎城，隨後耀羣也失踪。…我這裏已經派了幾名得力的同志去了，專爲這件事…」</p>
<p>「我明白了！」我心下右發慌，旁的話也不想聽下去了；正想吿訴他，等我把鼎元送回長辛店，連夜就要趕到通州去。</p>
<p>W君把手一揮，「還有！」他有些氣促似的，一剛剛我打電話給您之後，長辛店貴部忽然有電話來…」</p>
<p>「怎麽樣？」我覺得又是一驚，有些發毛，心口不期然地幢幢的撞了起來。</p>
<p>「我轉達，請您快快閘去……」W君說，「我問他有什麼重要的事，電話裏只說，「不行了，弟兄似已經全體川動，電廠已經起火，有大變動…」他說他是通訊員，負責的人，已經出去指揮去了再問電話已經斷了……我一直在這裏叫號，呌到現在…W君一口氣把這惡劣的消息說明了。</p>
<p>他話未說畢，我跳過去，一伸手，他知道我要試試他那秘密電話，便拿起剛才那個話筒遞給我。我一面叫電話，一面打手式叫他試試秘密電訊機。他們這副機器式樣較舊，話機與秘碼分開兩部份，可以同時發送。我們同時叫號，呌了好一會，臺無反應。我知沒有希望，便放下話筒。預備動身</p>
<p>「慢着！」君也停止發電，「淡有兩句話，剛才收到戰地情報，消息很壞，南苑第一三二師師長趙登禹已經陣亡，外圍河二十九軍副軍長佟麟關將軍，受了重傷，聽情報口氣，好像性命靠不住，究竟如何，還沒有確實消息。宛平方面，倭鬼增援反攻，我軍方面，也不利得很…我已經派了幾位同志和司機有四隻手提機關，分乘三部車子，同您一路去…也許！」</p>
<p>我祇舉了舉手說聲「好，謝謝！」拔步就走。</p>
<p>我上了車，我們四部車子一齊發動。這時我車子裏兩名衛兵，已經換了另外兩人，大約是W君的手下，車廂裏也放着一隻手提機槍，和一小箱子彈。車夫也不是原來的兩側勤務。這一切大槪都是W君安排的，我心下又是感激又是佩服。在車裏，我沒敢跟鼎元說什麽，祇支吾了兩句，反正他很疲倦，蜷在車角裏，好像要瞌睡似的。這是他興奮太過反應現像。</p>
<p>開車的好像已經受過調令，知道此行目的地就是長辛店，所以一直往西便西門出城，沒有要我管事。到了城外不多遠，他揮着手，叫後面的車子上前，我們的車落後，挿在第三，這樣我們的地位，比較保護得更週密一點。這時正四點多鐘，郊外陣地上的槍聲砲聲，聽得十分淸晰。車子快到田村的當口，忽然聽見前面一片樹林裏，有重機槍的吼聲。我們前面領路的車子，立即往大路側邊的幾棵大樹斜挿過去。我們的車子，當然緊緊跟着。到了最大一顆樹下，四部車子都找適當地點陸續停下，祇見第一部車上兩個同志，連司機一齊躍下，有一位靑年，好像隊長的動作，大聲喊着「大家都下車：找掩蔽！」又跑到我們事前，冲着我們行了一個軍禮，「請二位先生下車；日本飛機來了。一</p>
<h3>新世界交響曲</h3>
<p>— 朱理惺</p>
<p>爲紀念玻漢米亞大作曲家阿多尼，伏夏克（Antonin　Dvorak　Bohenten　1841—1904）所作＂E＂短調第五號交響樂寫</p>
<p>一九二〇十月十七日濃霧重重的晨曦裏，倫敦漢彌登哈丹霍爾交響樂團（Sir　HamitonHarty　＆　Halle　Symphony　Orchestia，London）在離威斯德敏思特大敎堂不遠的斯卡拉劇院（ScalaThealre）第一次演奏這一曲有史以來斯拉夫民族中大作曲家之一精心結構的＂E＂短調第五號「新世界」交響樂（HumoresqueSymphonie　en　mi　Mineur，Opus—95）。因爲是演習性質，所以來賓席上是座者無幾，但經過七十五鐘緩慢的鳴奏終了之後，却不料寥寥無幾的來賓席上，已是滿坑滿谷，甚至於很寬的走道上也擁滿了一大堆人；簡直把個斯卡拉劇院擠得密密層層，水洩不通。這批來賓都是不速之客，可是每個人無一不循規蹈矩　耳靜聽，散塲之後，一個個隨掌聲的消散步出劇院，相互含笑，皆大歡喜。</p>
<p>由於這一次把伏夏克的這支交響樂介紹到歐洲的西部，就速帶位處中歐的瑞士等國，方開始對斯拉夫民族中的作曲家漸漸的從刮目相視，而至於硏究，且發生興趣起來。譬如說，俄國的大作曲家彼特意里區。蔡卡考夫斯基（Peter　llyltch　Tschaikovski，1840—1893）的作品，在以前可以說是不甚被西歐，抑且即使中歐的人們所可了解的，伏夏克原籍是玻漢米亞，當然他寫出來的東西，難免也跟人不發生隔膜。在事實上固然一個民族具有一種特徵，可是日耳曼民族中的作品，却比較容易使人接受，斯拉夫民族作曲家要不是伏夏克這一曲「新世界」交響樂的晶心構造，恐怕到今天在樂藝的民族立塲上，還仍是各行其道，南轅北轍。</p>
<p>蔡卡考夫斯基比伏夏克長一歲，尼古拉，崙斯基考沙可夫（Nikola　Rimski－Korsakoff，1844－1908）却又比伏夏克小三歲，這三位一體代表斯拉夫民族大作曲家的各別在樂藝上的貢獻，總算把一部音樂史平添不少各民族間在樂藝上彼此標榜相互切磋的合作精神。就憑這一點，音樂直到今天從沒有發生分裂的現象。一百年來迄至今日，完完全全是統一的。在民族間特徵的性格分野裏，比較蔡卡考夫斯基的作品，最明顯並且表示最道地的東歐歐風令人一聽就覺得刺耳外，崙斯基考沙可夫就遠沒有那種固執成性故步自封。然而在另一方面說，蔡卡考夫斯基由於他把他的民族性喧染得道地，却也位於成功的一列。在他們兩者之間，伏夏克是最適中的天才者，這曲「新世界」交響樂，從描繪「晨曦」（Aurore）起，繼之是「思鄕所」的。＂A　ogio＂以至於終了的「急進幻想」一節，充分的把十九世紀中　理當在東中西歐三方面樂藝自然發展的程序上結構得冶金鑄鐵，萬流歸源。這在十足的成功而外，也不能不說是兩大民族間的因緣。怪不得具有樂理常識的人們，傾聆到這曲「新世界」自不免產生種種的遐想了。</p>
<p>在利卻，史特勞斯（Richard　Strauss）的筆記的，曾經記載過關於伏夏　這曲「新世界」交警是從他自己　　作品：＂E＂長調四組曲（Quinttelo　enmi　MajerOpus－22）蛻化而成，但這支四組曲的搆劃水準却遠超「新世界」之上，想來不免有些臆測。原因是這曲「新世界」交響以技術言，常然是成功的，在水準方面說，就遠不如他自已——伏夏克——所有的四組曲。後世人一致公認自弗朗茲，胥勃（Franz　Subert）以後，最肯把一身心血結構深奧的四組曲之第一人，非其莫屬。這在巴哈，摩渣，悲多汶，胥勃四位大作曲家以後，也就是他首屈一指的了。他決不會從硏究日耳曼大作曲家遺留下來的心得，蛻化作「新世界」的命名，更不會把「新世界」削足適履的深奧得難以令人理解，而後去創造這曲「新世界」。這在史特勞斯實在把它——「新世界」交響曲——估計得過高了。</p>
<p>「新世界」交響曲的英文名是：Symphony　No．5＂NewWorld＂in　E　Minor．Opus　95。在伏夏克一生的作品中。列爲第九十五闋。</p>

<p>夏令時間中止，恢復原來時間，鐘錶都撥慢一小時，因此，前天晚上我們過了兩個十二點鐘，因爲倒退一小時，令我們對於時間迷糊了，攪得頭昏腦脹！</p>
<p>有兩個朋友的約會，他們都用老鐘點，我用新鐘點，累得大家都埋怨，像這類事，道兩天一定發生不少。</p>

<h3>連環圖畫的內幕</h3>
<p>— 黃接青</p>
<p>已經深入民間的連環圖畫，是一種灌輸知識的有力工具；它的本身，無須負担對於社會的功過，問題衹在它的內容，應如何導便它納入正軌，不致成爲婦孺思想上的毒害。</p>
<p>理論並非本文重心，我衹提供關於連環圖書的一些更實：</p>
<p>清末已出現</p>
<p>連環圖畫遠在淸末已有出現，初時係用本印，印刷不良，內容也多荒謬怪誕，偏重低級趣味，不登大雅之堂。傳至民國初年，改用鉛印，編繪技術漸漸改善，但是採收材料，仍舊不離神怪，色情，遇有轟動一時的社會案件，無論敗俗傷風，也多錄爲內容，而且加以煊染，使一般淺識寡聞的讀者，神經受其麻醉。</p>
<p>直至民國二十年前後，始有以電影劇本作題材，由「大破金光陣」，「火燒紅蓮寺」，「獅頭怪俠」……等神怪演義，而趨向「漁光曲「，「迷途的羔羊」一，「小天使」，一「慈母曲一……」一類社會倫理故事。</p>
<p>連環圖畫內容的不斷變換，正是社會潮流，時局趨勢的反映，出版商爲了營業，不得不迎合讀者的心理。「目光銳利，頭腦敏感」，是必須具備的條件。抗戰以來，曾有關於軍事，科學，敎育和抗敵的連環圖畫出現，不下百餘種之多。雖然談不上功績，不過也許可以「將功贖罪」，稍稍抵償　日的過失。</p>
<p>吃連環　飯</p>
<p>上海現有的「連環圖畫」書局·約在十餘家左右，以「亞東」。「全球」，「日新」，「文德」「啓知」，「有文」等數家出書最多。這些出版商對於書的編繪人，火都是賣版給酬，不過按月論薪的也不在少數，倘若出書以後，銷路暢旺，史有額外花紅。待遇並不爲薄，所以覺有以此作爲終身職業。</p>
<p>連環圖書的銷路，一向以內地縣市鄕鎭爲主。此外，便是以六折的價格批發給本市的書攤和販賣商。據二十六　佔計，本市的「出租連環圖畫書攤」，共有四千餘個，從鬧市街到冷僻的陋巷，都有他們的踪跡。每一部畫（約二十至二十四小册），目前的租價是二百元，祇要出租六次、就可以撈回本綫了，如果刻苦節　，一個書攤，可能養活四口之家。</p>
<p>當局的處理</p>
<p>目前出版的連環圖書，必定先要經過社會局福利文化處書報影劇課檢査審核，獲得批准以後，方才可以付印發行。爲了審査非常嚴格，內容固然不得稍涉邪思，毽市標點符號差誤，也指令改正再行送檢，因此不良的連環圖畫已經逐漸淘汰，不致成爲貽害社會的讀物。我希望當局應當能够作更進一步的處置。</p>
<h3>鴕鳥紳士</h3>
<p>— 歸舟</p>
<p>太平洋戰爭爆發以前，一部份純粹的「香港人」因對抗戰「不大關心」。曾被譏爲「鴕鳥」。姑不論香港人該否被稱爲「鴕鳥」，但是香港的情形有異於國內各地，却是不容置辯的事實。因香港在善於「治理」的英人統治下爲時已過一百年了。香港有所謂「華人紳士」亦即「高等華人」。香港政府對這些紳士相當「客氣」，遇有關華人的事情就跟他們商量商量，要錢要力的時候更非向他們「商量」不可。等到他們出錢出力的數量可觀了。就由倫敦直接傳令嘉獎，或封爲「爵七」。「爵士」的頭銜在香港是了不起的呀！</p>
<p>然而有時候英國人也會擺起架子的。一九三九年英國人正建築一間學校，某「華人紳士」爲了討好起見，自動的捐了一筆巨款。等到學校落成後他要送他的少爺入學，不意英國人却不客氣的拒絕了，說這間學校是專爲英國孩子而設的，貴子弟有心求學，請向別家！</p>
<p>在外國人統治下的地方，緃能得到一時的「垂靑」，但是精神到底是痛苦的。</p>
<p>目前，不應該再有鴕鳥了！</p>

<p>在我國，隨便翻閱一張日報，或一本書籍雜誌，或有數字記載的任何東西；關於採用單位名稱的亂雜，除有專門性質的不談外，就是最普通的，眞是亂雜得無以復加了。請看下面：</p>
<p>長度：里·丈·尺·寸·分·市里·市尺·市寸·　公里·公尺　公分·基羅米達·米達·生的米達·英里·英尺·英寸·哩·呎·吋·碼·重量：天平秤的祖·斤·兩·市秤的祖·市·兩磅·唡·（盎斯）公斤·公噸·英噸（重噸二二四〇磅）美噸（輕噸·二〇〇〇磅）司馬祖（棉花箔類採用）</p>
<p>容量：石·市石·加倫·公升·立方公尺·英方（黃砂石子採用）</p>
<p>面積：畝·市畝·噋·英畝·公畝·平方市尺·平方呎·平方公尺·平方哩·平方公里.</p>
<p>幣制：法幣·關金……</p>
<p>在上述這許多名稱放裏，其實英里……英寸興哩……吋及公里……公寸與基羅米達……生的米達各是同一種長度，在說者或寫者衹要稍留神，就可使未受敎育的一般人一目了然，不致弄錯。現在旣經政府規定，採用了市制，則　的里·尺·天平秤·石·畝……等都可廢棄；雖然在實用上或許一時難以更正，但在文字上，儘可把牠折算易換了，藉資倡導。</p>
<p>在同一篇記載裏，往往採用兩種甚至兩種以上的單位名稱，如寫了英畝，又寫　，而再用公畝，再用平方哩。要知畝，　公畝的面積，相差不在小數，以致即使是同一數字，使讀者一時得不到一個準確的觀念　　從比較，不知道畝，　，公畝，平方哩等互相關係的人，更弄得莫明其妙。</p>
<p>更笑話的，記載我們本國的面積，距離，數量……等，不用國定制而採用公制，更有不少人，却去用英制或其他單位名稱，如上海到杭州約一百餘哩……等，正如榮德生的綁案，要用美金來計算而不用法幣取贖一樣。因此，儘有人會把國產貨物，亦將用美金標價，在國內市塲出現了！</p>
<p>三，四一七五，九八六二這歡字固然有人讀做三億四千一百七十五萬九千八百六十二，但也有更多人仍讀做三萬萬四千一百七十五萬九千八百六十二的。（此數應寫爲三，〇〇〇〇，四一七五，九八六二）</p>
<p>現在立法院已通過了標準法，希望以後逐漸地能標準起來才好！</p>
<h3>編餘</h3>
<p>— 勁草</p>
<p>一，軋票</p>
<p>軋票員：「爲什麼不買票？你是那一部份？不行！不買票！下車去！」</p>
<p>軍人：「我是編餘的軍官，因爲沒有錢，只得揩一次油，對不起，請你原諒一點吧！」</p>
<p>軋票員：「沒有錢，誰相信。」（慫恿着旁邊的一個巡車憲兵）「請你查一査他，到底有沒有錢。」</p>
<p>憲兵：（翻着軍人袋內掏出的東西，邊數邊唸着）「軍人手牒一本，離職證一張，負傷證章一枚，郵票六十分，草紙二張，針一隻，法幣三十五元。沒有了！」</p>
<p>軋票員：「眞的……」向軍人白了一眼。</p>
<p>二，檢査</p>
<p>憲兵：「同志，請問你是什麼部隊？」</p>
<p>軍人：「編餘軍官。」</p>
<p>憲兵：「旣然是編餘了，應該穿便服，又無證章符號。」</p>
<p>軍人：「沒有錢買便衣。」</p>
<p>憲兵；不行，跟我到隊部裏去，沒有話說。」</p>
<p>軍人：「好的。」（心理想：二頓沒有吃過東西，到他們部隊裏去，飯總得給我吃。）</p>
<h3>離婚在美國</h3>
<p>— 喬治</p>
<p>離婚在美國人眼裏，不是悲劇，祇是一塲遊戲。</p>
<p>據今年九月美國官方統計：去年結婚總數爲一百六十一萬八千三百三十一對，宣吿離異者已有百分之三十一。去年成立之新家庭平均每三家中即有一家破裂</p>
<p>一九三〇年，美國全國的離婚案僅十九萬二千起，一九四〇年已經增至二十六萬四千起。</p>
<p>英國在一九三八年結婚的人，共有四十萬人，而在那一年間離婚的却也有二萬四千人之多。離婚與結婚的比率，在英國是一與十七。今年一月一日至八月二十日止，英國離婚案已有一萬七千五百起——即三萬五千人。法國離婚案，平均每年約二萬起。</p>
<h3>生育的數字</h3>
<p>美國每年二百十五萬人、日本二百十九萬人，德國一百二十七萬儿千人。英國六十萬人，法國六十三萬人。</p>
<p>法國不單人口生育落後，並且在兩次大戰中喪失男子壯丁三百萬名，成爲女多於男的現象——約爲一〇九與一〇〇之比。因此法國在數年前已經成立「法國人口部」，最近更由該部擬訂計劃，獎勵生育，凡是結婚的男女，每對可以獲得貸款八萬至十萬佛郞，分期十年償還，並且每生一孩，可以扣除欠款二萬佛郞，倘若來一次一胎五孩，那末這一筆債便可以一筆勾淸。</p>
<p>畢竟法國是文明國家，不比在希特勒統治時的德國，爲了「獎勵」生育，竟迫使和尙開色戒，尼姑作公娼的。</p>
<h3>低調</h3>
<p>— 戈枕生</p>
<p>共黨軍事領袖賀龍口中暴露了共產黨的「進步」：他指着「解放區〕說：糧局一下子霉爛了九百担……財經商業機關一貪汚，就是幾十萬幾百萬（當然是「邊幣」！）……衛生部材料科科長，一個人貪汚的東西，就够他老婆，孩子，保姆等七個人揮霍七年！難怪親共的美國記者費正淸先生也說：共黨上台後的「情形」是不可知的。</p>
<p>公家好比是產婦，接收的物資該是腹中的胎兒。而接收大員，實際只等於催生婆。物資爛腐了，或是刧搜了，就不啻是催生婆下了毒手，從娘胎中割掉了一塊肉——眞是一塊又一塊的，一片又一片的——眞是血淋淋的，淚盈盈的呀——你想這胎兒還有什麽用？這產婦又是多少的苦痛？</p>
<p>交通的破壞或炸毁，情形也跟「刦搜」差不多。試舉一個眼前的實例：熱河承德附近的火車被炸在隧道裏，沒法可想，便只好用氫　焔把它溶化之後，取出其一片片或一塊塊。這樣的東西，修也修不好，而且也修不起。嗚呼，小生命死了不算，連母體實在也有點老命不剩之概了。寄語破壞交通之輩，千萬要想像我們國家這個產婦之難言的苦痛呀！</p>
<p>女兒賤，男子也何嘗値錢？舞風一禁，據說舞女已由舞池投入「火坑」，改貨腰而爲「薦枕」，而這就是所謂「改業」。現在人力車已在逐步取締之列，倘不及早想些改業的實際辦法，則人力車夫的「火坑」，恐亦難免，但不知又在那裏耳。</p>

<h3>「胭脂血」中的女主角一林達黛妮兒。</h3>
<p>新聞人物</p>
<h3>吳鐵城先生</h3>
<p>— 疾風</p>
<p>最近的報紙上時常載着吳鐵城氏的談話，不久前還盛傳吳氏將長合灣，使我不禁想起這位在上海歷史上有着極大功績的舊任市長。無疑的，在上海歷任市長中，吳氏予上海人士的印象最深刻。</p>
<p>當民國二十一年一月七日吳氏担任上海市長後，只隔三星期，「一二八」事變就在淞滬爆發了。這時時機的急迫，事態的艱危，任何人都能想像得到，其部下多數手足無措，而吳氏每日照常到府辦公外，還參與戎機，（吳氏原係軍人），折衝外交，澈夜工作。其後他又經歷長城綏東各戰役，以及西安事變。在華洋雜處，關係複雜的上海市，一面要應付善於播弄事變的外人特殊勢力，一面願付良　不齊的居民，是最艱難而不易討好的工作；但是在民國廿一年到廿六年，這五年中，吳氏都予以妥善的處置，保障了全市四百萬居民的安全與幸福，並且滲澹經營市中心區的建設，可謂文治武功，相得益彰。</p>
<p>一個交際家</p>
<p>吳氏極善交際，在上海市長任內，時常舉行茶會，招待中外來賓，社團邀請演說，無不欣然允諾。他口才雖並不挺好。但演說時姿態風度，極其雍容大方。甚至商店劇院開幕，他也樂於參加。二十五年大新遊樂塲開幕時，吳氏致訓說：「我不是老爺，凡是社會上一切有益有意義的事，我都願意參加。」</p>
<p>可是吳氏的交際手腕，並不用來「出風頭」。民國二十四年上海各界，鑒於吳氏對地方上的偉績，發起建立「吳市長紀念亭」，吳氏却堅決辭謝，致函各界，請取銷成議。二十六年三月七日，是吳氏五十大慶，親友僚屬及各界人士，都預備舉觴稱慶，嚇得吳氏在七日那天溜到蕪錫去避壽，僅在六日晚與新聞界人士共聚聯歡。</p>
<p>吳氏身材魁梧，提倡體育甚力，他本人亦爲一運動健將，長滬時在體育上有兩大貢獻：一是完成市中心區運動塲，一是擘劃在上海開幕的全國運動會。全運會開幕時，吳氏常在塲中開球及頒發獎品。</p>
<p>一輛舊卡車</p>
<p>吳氏是廣東中山縣人，早年留學美國日本，辛亥革命時任九江軍政府參謀次畏兼交涉使，九年任討賊軍總指揮，嗣後歷任大總統府參軍，廣東省警衛軍司令，廣東省警務處長兼廣州市公安局長，廣州衛戌司令等職務。民國二十年張羣辭上海市畏職，由吳氏接長，二十六年調長「第一故鄉」的廣東，（吳氏向稱上海爲渠第二故鄉，）正値抗戰軍興，吳氏在粤組織民衆，昂揚民氣。不遺餘力。二十八年辭省政府主席，任職中樞，現任中央黨部秘書長。本年五月中曾來上海，經過了八年抗戰工作，吳氏已沒有以前那麽壯健了，但是他對記者們說：「這回到上海來，檢騐身體，想把這部舊卡車修理好了，還要跟各位中年，靑年一樣，同爲國家出力！」</p>

<h3>The Air of Peace Again Turns Dim: The Chinese Communists Present a Memorandum to the Government, Clearly Using it as a Pretext to Shirk Military Responsibility</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent, Nanjing, 1st] The atmosphere for negotiations in the capital has been improving recently. Zhou Enlai's reply and his arrival date in Beijing are being closely watched by all parties. The government's forbearance in seeking peace and its active preparations for convening a conference have further increased the optimistic belief of those concerned about national affairs. However, a cloud suddenly appeared in the clear sky – the memorandum issued by the Communist Party. This document was signed by Zhou Enlai, Dong Biwu, Ye Jianying, Wu Yuzhang, Lu Dingyi, Deng Yingchao, and Li Weihan, and addressed to the representatives of the Political Consultative Conference (PCC) for submission to Chairman Chiang. It was brought to Beijing by a special envoy from Shanghai on the night of the 30th. On the morning of the 1st, Dong Biwu and Wang Bingnan delivered a copy with the same content to Special Envoy Marshall and held talks. They left at 11:05 AM. At noon, Dong and Wang accepted Ambassador Stuart's invitation from the previous evening and informed him of the contents of the memorandum at the embassy. As for the copy addressed to the government representatives, it was also entrusted to someone for delivery to Secretary-General Wu Tiecheng. The content of this memorandum not only emphasizes the Zhangjiakou battle as an excuse, but also shifts all responsibility for the military actions of the past three months to the government. In the past, memoranda between the two sides were kept secret, but this time it is different, which is surprising to many. This correspondent asked the spokesperson of the Communist delegation on the evening of the 1st whether the release of the memorandum had been agreed to by the mediators in advance. The spokesperson said that the release of the memorandum was because the Communist Party attached special importance to the Zhangjiakou battle and wanted the public to fully understand the incident. The government has remained silent on the matter, as it does not want to deliberately create a rift while peace is gradually progressing. When this correspondent asked the mediator Marshall's spokesperson Connors, he did not express any opinion. However, it is widely believed that this may put the mediators in a more difficult position. In the past few days, Wang Bingnan's contacts with Marshall had shown signs of easing, and he emphasized the change in the Communist Party's attitude, which made Marshall optimistic about the prospects for peace. Now, the sudden release of this memorandum clearly indicates their intention to move towards a breakdown. According to sources familiar with the inside story, Zhou Enlai's meetings with various parties in Shanghai were mainly aimed at promoting the reunification of the Democratic League, because the Communist Party is unwilling to rashly participate in the informal five-person group meeting if it cannot control the Democratic League. This is the real reason for his internal discussions on general issues, and then exchanging views with Special Envoy Marshall. He left at 9:50 AM and went directly to the Executive Yuan to visit President Song, where they talked for about two hours. The ambassador then returned to the embassy. President Song immediately went to see the Chairman to report on the matter. In the afternoon at 5:00 PM, the ambassador's personal advisor, Fu Jingbo, visited President Song again and talked for 45 minutes. At 7:00 PM in the evening, the ambassador hosted a banquet at his residence for Special Envoy Marshall and his wife. Marshall met with Dong Biwu and Wang Bingnan from 10:00 AM to 11:00 AM on the 1st, and then had several phone calls with the ambassador in the afternoon.</p>
<h3>Zhou Enlai Tells Reporters: The Key Lies in a Ceasefire; The Chinese Communists Demand a Halt to the Attack on Zhangyuan</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Zhou Enlai met with Chinese and foreign reporters at his residence yesterday afternoon. About 100 people attended. Zhou said on the spot:</p>
<p>"It has been more than a month since I last met with you. As I expected, this period has passed in 'dragging on'. However, the civil war has become increasingly large and has now spread to the gateway of Zhangjiakou. The government has mobilized nine armies and is advancing on Chahar Province from three sides: Rehe, Hebei, and Suiyuan. The fighting began two days ago. Nie Rongzhen, Commander of the 'Liberated Area', has issued a memorandum to the Peiping Executive Headquarters. Subsequently, the Communist delegation has protested to Chairman Chiang. I myself have been ordered to submit a memorandum to Special Envoy Marshall. Ye Jianying, the Communist representative at the Peiping Executive Headquarters, has also submitted a memorandum to the government representatives. These protests and memoranda have clearly stated that if the government continues to attack, the Communist Party will have no choice but to believe that the government intends to destroy the peace negotiations and that all consequences and responsibilities should be borne by the Nationalist government.</p>
<p>Since the Japanese surrender, the Communist Party's attitude has always been to strive for peace, democracy, independence, and unity. Since Special Envoy Marshall participated in the mediation, the Communist Party's proposal has been to cease fire and handle everything in accordance with the PCC resolutions. The Communist Party's position has never changed. After the Double Tenth Agreement was issued last year, the war only stopped until January of this year, but the government was unwilling to cease fire in the Northeast, and the war broke out again. After March of this year, the war spread to the interior, and continues until today.</p>
<p>Now the government has attacked Zhangjiakou. Under these serious circumstances, the government not only does not want to cease fire, but will certainly have more demands after occupying Zhangjiakou.</p>
<p>Recently, Special Envoy Marshall proposed holding a three-person meeting and an informal five-person group at the same time. We believe that whether it is one meeting or two meetings, they are only formal issues. The key today is ceasefire, and stopping the attack on Chahar, centered on Zhangjiakou.</p>
<p>In terms of politics, since the PCC resolutions were passed, the government's comprehensive group and constitutional drafting group were still meeting in Chongqing in February, March, April, and May. It is the Kuomintang that is undermining the PCC. Chairman Chiang once publicly announced that the National Assembly would be postponed indefinitely until an agreement was reached, but in mid-July, he suddenly announced that the meeting would be held in mid-November without consulting with the various parties. Recently, he suddenly ordered all parties to list names, which is clearly what the democratic elements participating in the PCC do not want.</p>
<p>We believe that regardless of the three-person meeting, the five-person group, or the National Assembly, the key to everything is a ceasefire, and stopping the attack on Zhangjiakou. If the government stops attacking Zhangjiakou, there is still room for negotiation. Otherwise, the government is determined to destroy any possibility of peace and all responsibility should be borne by the Kuomintang."</p>
<h3>Celebrating the Chairman's Birthday</h3>
<p>Compiled and printed by the News Bureau of the Ministry of National Defense</p>
<p>"The Great Chairman Chiang"</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 1st] The News Bureau of the Ministry of National Defense has compiled and printed a book entitled "The Great Chairman Chiang" to celebrate the Chairman's birthday.

<p>[Another dispatch] The Capital Provisional Assembly decided to launch a fundraising campaign to establish the Zhongzheng Children's Welfare Center, with the aim of implementing children's social education and group healthy living. The site is planned to be built on a twelve-mu garden behind Jieshou Hall on Hongwu Road.</p>
<h3>Liu Bocheng Missing</h3>
<p>Rumored to be Wounded in the Battle of Heze</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Kaifeng, 1st] (1) There are rumors that Liu Bocheng, the commander-in-chief of the Communist forces, was wounded and missing in the Battle of Heze, and his whereabouts are still unknown. (2) After the recovery of Heze, most of the people, except for a small number who were coerced by the Communist forces, gradually returned and rebuilt their homes with joy. (3) The Communist forces' independent 1st and 2nd Regiments occupying Jiyuan and Meng County have been extremely panicked recently and are transporting the plundered materials to the mountains one after another. They are also forcing the people to hide food and cover wells. (4) There are still thousands of remnants of the Communist forces in the area between Dingtao, Cao County, and Heze. They have ordered the model platoons of the various county brigades not to retreat north and to remain in the original area to disrupt public order.</p>
<h3>Hiring Special Envoy Marshall as Honorary Citizen</h3>
<p>Initiated by Members of the Beijing Provisional Assembly</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 1st] Chen Yuguang, Shen Jiuxiang, and more than 20 other members of the Beijing Provisional Assembly believe that Special Envoy Marshall and Ambassador Stuart have mediated for peace with high virtue and great merit. They have recently initiated a letter to the municipal government, urging them to hire Marshall and Stuart as honorary citizens of Nanjing and hold a grand ceremony on a regular basis to inform both domestic and foreign parties to show their admiration.</p>

<h3>Troops Advance North Between Yangzhou and Taizhou; Vanguard Troops Arrive Near Fanchuan; Troops in Eastern Shandong Advance 30 Li Simultaneously</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent, Taixian, 1st] To curb the harassment of the Communist forces, the government troops on the Yangzhou-Taizhou line have recently advanced north from Yiling Town. The Communist forces were defeated and retreated in disorder. The vanguard troops of the government troops have now arrived near Fanchuan and are confronting the Communist forces. In the future, depending on the needs of the overall situation, they will either advance east to Xinghua or west to Gaoyou.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent, Taixian, 1st] The Communist forces northwest of Gangkou Town in Taixian have recently dismantled fortifications and are withdrawing north from Ban Ning on their own initiative. The town has been taken over by the militia.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent, Taixian, 1st] After arriving in Haian, the government troops are now turning east and have reached the Sancang River area, confronting the Communist forces.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Qingdao, 1st] In order to prevent the Communist forces from attacking, the government troops in eastern Shandong have launched a counterattack in recent days, advancing 30 li to the west of Jiaoxian and the east of Weixian. The Communist forces are currently reinforcing a large number of troops and weapons from Yantai and Weihai to try to reverse the decline. In addition, the Communist forces north of Gaomi and Pingdu on the Jiaoji Railway have been mobilizing very frequently recently, and have gathered about 70,000 people in three divisions and six brigades, with unclear intentions.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Jinan, 1st] After the Communist forces suffered losses in northern Henan and northern Jiangsu, their lurking troops in various parts of northeastern Shandong have been forcibly conscripting manpower in various places in order to expand their strength.</p>
<h3>Peace Talks in Progress; Suspension of the Promulgation of the National Assembly Convocation Order</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent, Nanjing, 1st] The National Assembly Convocation Order was originally scheduled to be issued on the 2nd. According to a responsible person, the peace talks are currently in progress, and the Convocation Order will not be issued temporarily tomorrow and may be delayed for two weeks. According to an authoritative source, Chairman's August 14th statement submitted the draft constitution to the National Assembly in an effort to gather more perfect opinions from all parties. This refers to the fact that the draft constitution must be based on the principles agreed upon by the PCC meeting and the comprehensive group meeting. If the five-person group can proceed smoothly, the government will be able to exchange views with the various parties in order to reach a compromise.</p>
<h3>Claims of the Government Army Attacking Zhangjiakou Denied as Groundless; Troops in Northern Shanxi Join Forces in County</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Peiping, 30th] Reports said that the government troops began to attack Zhangjiakou on the 29th. The reporter made a special visit to the Peiping Military Headquarters to inquire about the truth. According to the spokesperson's answer: there is no such thing. The report is based on speculation, and the claim that a general offensive order has been issued is even more unfounded.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Baoding, 1st] After the entire 5th Regiment of the Communist forces gathered in Baisha, Pingshan, north of Pingshan, they moved to the north bank of the Hutuo River, showing signs of fleeing north to Zhangjiakou.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent, Tianjin, 1st] The war in the northern section of the Pinghan Railway has expanded, and the telecommunications of the Railway Bureau have been damaged everywhere. The telephone lines between Peiping and Baoding and Zhuozhou have all been cut off. The offensive launched by the Communist forces in the northern section of the Pinghan Railway is entirely to coordinate the unfavorable situation of the military situation in Chahar Province.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Taiyuan, 30th] The government troops in Huangzhai (20 kilometers north of Taiyuan) advanced north along the Datong-Puzhou Railway on the 29th. The Communist forces occupying Pingxing that day joined forces with our garrison in Xinzhou. The railway traffic between Xinzhou and Taiyuan can be restored.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Zhengzhou, 30th] The militia units of the Communist forces in the Ci County and Linzhang area have surrendered to the government troops in recent days, with "more than 1,200 people, and have all arrived safely in Anyang.</p>
<h3>Western Section of the Peisui Railway to be Open to Traffic Soon</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent, Nanjing, 1st] It is learned that since the siege of Datong was lifted, the northern and southern ends of the western section of the Peisui Railway have been actively carrying out restoration work and will be open to traffic within days.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent, Nanjing, 1st] Relevant parties received a telegram from the front line in eastern Suiyuan yesterday evening, dated the 29th, stating that after the government troops recovered Xinghe County on the 27th, the Communist forces launched a counterattack with more than 3,000 infantry and cavalry on the 29th. After a fierce battle of one day and night, all the Communist forces were either killed or wounded, and all were captured, totaling about 2,000. At this point, the Communist forces' attempt to threaten Jining from western Chahar was completely shattered, and eastern Suiyuan was stabilized, making Suiyuan a complete province in North China. The local military and political authorities are stepping up their work, on the one hand actively appeasing the refugees and carrying out political work, and on the other hand reorganizing the troops to prepare for a counterattack against the Communist forces that may flee west from Zhangyuan.</p>
<h3>The Chahar Rehabilitation Committee Decides to Invalidate All Border Currency</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Peiping, 1st] The Chahar Provincial Rehabilitation Planning Committee convened the aforementioned meeting in Peiping yesterday, presided over by Chairman Feng Qinzhai.

<h3>Good News for Civil Servants</h3>
<p>Pay Adjustments Possible Next Month</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent, Nanjing, 1st] Regarding the adjustment of civil servant salaries, according to relevant sources, the authorities are indeed considering it, but it is unlikely to be realized this month, as the last adjustment was in August. Based on the principle of adjusting once every three months, an increase in November seems more likely. As for how much the increase will be, the authorities have not made a final decision.</p>
<h3>General Gillon Arrives in Peiping</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Peiping, 1st] The newly appointed American member of the Military Mediation Department, General Gillon, arrived in Peiping from Shanghai with his family on the afternoon of the 1st.

It is generally speculated that Director of the Finance Department Dong Chengdao and Director of the Distribution Department Zai Fusheng may also resign. The newly appointed Director Huo Baoshu told reporters who visited yesterday that he had not yet received the order and was not in a position to express his opinion. The UNRRA's duties are arduous, and he is deeply afraid that he will not be able to fulfill them. He has decided to go to Beijing this Saturday to resign and attend the quadrennial joint conference held in Beijing. However, if the government does not allow him to get rid of the assignment, he still hopes that all parties will continue to assist him and work together to serve the country. It is also learned that Chiang went to Beijing yesterday morning and returned to Shanghai in the afternoon.</p>

<h3>Chairman Encourages Shanghai Assembly Petition Delegation to Assist the Government in Construction; Attaches Importance to the Opinions of Public Opinion Organs</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent, Nanjing, 1st] Chairman Chiang met with representatives of the Shanghai Assembly Petition Delegation at his official residence at 5:00 PM on the 1st and expressed optimism about the current situation. It is said that once the situation improves and political unity is achieved, all problems will be solved naturally. In terms of the economic foundation, the current situation is better than before the war, and all aspects have improved compared to the past. He also said that the government will attach importance to the opinions put forward by public opinion organs and will instruct the relevant agencies to study and consider them separately. The government will immediately find ways to stop the impact of usury on production. The government has already handled all the suggestions made by the previous petition delegation that can be handled. Adjusting the exchange rate and exempting export taxes are examples. Finally, he encouraged the business community not to be discouraged and hoped that they would seek self-improvement in all aspects and assist the government in construction.</p>
<p>President Song was originally scheduled to meet with the petition delegation on the 1st, but due to work, the meeting was postponed to 4:00 PM on the 2nd. It is reported that the representatives of the petition delegation will have a longer period of discussion on the 2nd. When meeting with reporters, he also said that he will meet with the petition delegation on the 2nd to help solve the difficulties of industry and commerce. The schedule of the petition delegation on the 2nd is as follows: at 11:00 AM, they will go to the Executive Yuan to continue talks with Ministers Wang Yunwu and Yu Hongjun. In the afternoon, they will submit opinions to various agencies. At 4:00 PM, they will visit President Song. Some representatives plan to take a car back to Shanghai on the evening of the 2nd.</p>
<h3>Luo Qinghua Describes the Current Crisis of Industry and Commerce to the Chairman; Explains the Key Points of Each Request</h3>
<p>When the petition delegation visited the Chairman, Xu Jiying explained the organization process and the mission of the delegation. Then, Luo Qinghua described in detail the current crisis of industry and commerce and the hopes for the government, saying: "At present, the situation of industry and commerce is the most difficult for industry, and legitimate commerce is also suffering from the oppression of usury, and deeply feels the pain of insufficient capital turnover. Some people despise the industrial and commercial crisis in Shanghai because Shanghai retailers have closed down. In fact, since the Anti-Japanese War, retailers have been unable to promote domestic products due to their high prices, and have changed to selling foreign goods and smuggled goods to maintain their business. This is not a good phenomenon. Secondly, the population of Shanghai has increased, and 4 million people are concentrated in the old concessions. On the surface, it seems prosperous, but in reality, the purchasing power is far less than before. It is strong on the outside and weak on the inside, which is not optimistic. In the past two months, there have been almost daily closures of factories. There are three reasons: first, the lack of funds and the exploitation of usury; second, the increase in wages and the increase in costs; and third, the low-price dumping of imported goods and surplus materials. In addition, there are some industrial and commercial industries that are in a state of living and dying, such as the knitting industry and the silk weaving industry. Due to the lack of funds, they stop work for almost two days out of three days. If the products are scarce, the cost will be expensive, and they will eventually run out of money. The morning industry also has this kind of pain, resulting in the phenomenon of goods being abandoned on the ground, which is heartbreaking. In terms of international trade, the current situation is the best opportunity for us to develop the international market, but due to exchange rate relations, the cost is not enough and it cannot be exported. Japan, under the support of MacArthur, is actively developing, which is infuriating and makes us deeply vigilant. If we cannot lay the foundation for international trade within one year, and the government can make significant sacrifices, it is hopeless to strive for the international market." Luo then explained the key points of each request made by the petition delegation, saying: "It has been a year since the end of the Anti-Japanese War, and the ports have been opened, and more and more foreign goods are coming. The government should change its wartime economic policy in the past, improve financial measures, strengthen the specialization of banks, strengthen the connection between finance and industry, strengthen the connection between the central and local governments, and launch production loans for agriculture, industry, and commerce at low interest rates, starting from increasing production incentives, to achieve the goal of contracting currency and balancing international payments." Finally, he explained the importance of the relationship between Shanghai and even the whole country, and hoped that the central and local governments could concentrate their efforts to work together. Then, the representatives spoke one by one. Xi Yushu hoped that the banks could be specialized, and that the national banks could relax the number of industrial and agricultural loans so that the industrial and commercial circles could get substantial benefits. He also pointed out that the government only focused on the work of takeover in the past, and did not pay attention to the suffering of industry and commerce, and there was no performance in the construction work. It is actually a "not eating eggs but eating chickens" method. Tao Baichuan stated the financial difficulties of the Shanghai Municipal Government. Although it has recently decided to increase two new taxes to carry out construction work, it is still insufficient. He hoped that the government could allocate half of the proceeds from the sale of the Shanghai takeover materials for the construction of Shanghai. Jin Runxiang mentioned the experience of the petition delegation coming to Beijing last time and hoped that the government could adopt and implement the points mentioned. Wang Xianqing explained that the interest rate on the four-way loan is nominally 5%, but with the addition of handling fees, etc., it is actually 10%. He hoped that the government would improve it. In addition, Yu Zuoqu, Wang Yansong, Xu Guomao, Yang Fusheng, and others also expressed their opinions. The Chairman answered them one by one, which lasted about 45 minutes before leaving at 5:45.</p>
<h3>Adjusting Exchange Rates and Exempting Export Taxes Still Hardly Rescues Industry and Commerce; Wu Tiecheng States That the Government Will Naturally Support Them</h3>
<p>The petition delegation, after gathering at the Zhejiang Xingye Bank around 9:00 AM on the 1st, first went to the Central Party Headquarters, where they were received by Secretary-General Tiecheng and Minister Lifu. First, delegation leader Xu Jiting explained the mission and the current crisis facing industry and commerce, hoping the government could provide relief. Then, Jin Runxiang delivered a speech, strongly emphasizing the severity of the current economic crisis and the soaring prices, hoping the government could establish a definite economic policy and implement the points raised by the previous petition delegation to Nanjing. He stated that the government's adjustment of exchange rates and exemption of export taxes were still insufficient to save the faltering industry and commerce, and that factory closures still occurred frequently. He hoped the government would pay attention to this. Secretary-General Wu Tiecheng responded, saying that the government shared the same deep anxiety as the industrial and commercial sectors regarding the current economic crisis and would naturally find ways to support various industries and businesses. Subsequently, Luo Qinghua delivered a speech, first explaining the points that should be improved in the current economic policy, pointing out that the previous measures of tightening credit and inflating currency had led to a shrinking of production, while the door was wide open for foreign trade, allowing foreign goods to flood in, posing a great danger to the future of industry and commerce. This was not just a problem for Shanghai alone. Luo also explained the two suggestions proposed by the petition delegation, hoping the government could follow the precedent set after the January 28th Incident and establish an economic reconstruction committee in Shanghai, with President Song serving as chairman, and the mayor and chairman of the municipal council as vice-chairmen. He also requested the government to allocate half of the one trillion in materials received as war reparations as a special fund for the revitalization of Shanghai, as these materials were all the people's hard-earned wealth taken by the Japanese and should be returned to their rightful owners. Luo concluded with a loud appeal, saying that the situation of industry and commerce was so serious that it must not be allowed to suffer further damage and continue to shrink, leading to urban famine and unimaginable consequences. He deeply hoped that Secretary-General Wu, who had previously served as the mayor of Shanghai, could convey these opinions. Finally, Secretary-General Wu responded, saying that when he was the mayor of Shanghai, the municipal government was very capable of cooperating with the citizens. Shanghai was the economic center of the country, and to seek national economic revitalization, it was necessary to first ensure the stability of this important center. The government would naturally do its best to cooperate with industry and commerce.</p>
<p>After leaving the Central Party Headquarters, the petition delegation went to the Executive Yuan, intending to meet with President Song, but because Song was in discussions with Ambassador Stuart and Chuan Jingbo, they were instead received by Secretary-General Jiang Menglin, Minister of Finance Yu Hongjun, and Minister of Economy Wang. Xu Shenqing, Luo Qinghua, and others successively spoke, explaining the mission and the points that the industrial and commercial sectors of Shanghai hoped from the government. The talks concluded at 1:00 PM. At 3:00 PM, they visited Liang Hancao, Deputy Secretary-General of the Supreme National Defense Council, and departed after about 45 minutes.</p>

<h3>British Business Delegation Will Represent the Government to Express Respect to Our Country and Will Order Eggs, Silk, Etc.</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 30th] A British business delegation, led by Sir Bowers, has departed on two special planes for a visit to China. The delegation consists of nine members and is under the order of the British government, carrying a message of greetings from the Minister of Commerce, Sir Cripps, to President Chiang. It is expected to stay in China for three months to study the development of trade between China and Britain and may order eggs, vegetables, oils, and silk from China. In addition, it is learned that Sir Cripps, before the departure of the delegation, sent a letter to the leader, Sir Bowers, stating: "Please convey to China, on behalf of the British government and people, the greatest respect, and wish them an unlimited future. The Chinese military and civilians have bravely resisted the invasion of the violent Japanese for the longest time and finally achieved the final victory, which makes Britain extremely admired. During the war, we paid close attention to it at all times. At this moment, looking forward to the close cooperation between China and Britain, a new era of expanding world trade will surely be opened. I believe that China and Britain will be in an important position in future world trade. Our industrial knowledge and industrial resources are sufficient to help China develop its national wealth and gradually improve the living standards of the Chinese people. Britain particularly admires ancient Chinese culture and deeply approves of its new aspirations. These two emotions have now merged into one."</p>
<h3>Mrs. Cripps Will Visit Various Places</h3>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper] Mrs. Cripps, the president of the British Aid to China Fund, is scheduled to leave Britain on the 5th of this month and arrive in Hong Kong on the 8th.

At that time, President and Mrs. Chiang will host a banquet to welcome her and award her the Order of Yunhui to thank her for her contributions to assisting China. After staying in Nanjing for four days, Mrs. Cripps, along with her companions (Mrs. Cripps' daughter, Miss Becky, Mrs. Miller, the General Secretary of the Aid to China Fund, and others) will fly to Chongqing and then to Chengdu to inspect the educational center of Sichuan. On the way, they plan to visit the well salt industry in Zigong and the work of the Women's Guidance Committee in Leshan.</p>
<p>After departing from Chengdu, they will transfer to Santai to inspect the Chinese Industrial Cooperatives, then to Lanzhou. In addition, they will visit various places in Gansu to inspect post-war relief work, and then go to Zhengzhou to visit the Yellow River blockage project of the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration.</p>
<p>Mrs. Cripps will go from Zhengzhou to Beijing for a short stay of one week, then to Shenyang and several CCP areas to visit the International Peace Hospitals maintained by the Aid to China Fund in the past three years. Finally, Mrs. Cripps will come to Shanghai to meet with people from all walks of life, staying in Shanghai for at least five days, then go to Nanjing to bid farewell to President and Mrs. Chiang, and then go to Guangdong for three days before returning to Hong Kong.</p>
<h3>Britain Donates Over 40,000 Tons of Bridge-Building Equipment to China</h3>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper] In order to help promote domestic transportation in China, UNRRA recently shipped 42,300 tons of bridge-building equipment to China, with a value of 20 million British pounds, enough to build 904 bridges. This material is all donated by the United Kingdom. There are now many engineers, including two from Nevada, two from Denmark, and one American expert, who have made a special trip to Britain to learn bridge construction techniques, because this type of bridge is military in nature and different from ordinary bridges.

<h3>Zhejiang's Special Product Output Sharply Reduced, Authorities Seek Revival</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Hangzhou, 1st] Zhejiang Province's special products, such as silk, tea, cotton, and tung oil, are the largest. They suffered heavy losses during the war, resulting in a sharp decline in output, especially fresh cocoons. Tea has decreased from 400,000 dan before the war to 100,000 dan. Cotton and tung oil have also decreased by more than four-fifths, with annual output of only over 100,000 dan. In addition, increased costs, reduced sales, and restrictions on foreign exchange have led to production contraction and economic decline. Local people and the ruling authorities are now trying to revive the special products, first seeking to reach pre-war output, and then gradually improving them.</p>
<h3>Wuxi Labor Dispute Resolved, Resumption of Work Commenced Yesterday</h3>

<h3>Zhao Hengti Arrives in Hankou; Claims Hunan Disaster Can Be Overcome</h3>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper, Hankou, 1st] Zhao Hengti, Speaker of the Hunan Provincial Assembly, arrived in Hankou yesterday and is scheduled to fly to Nanjing this afternoon. According to Zhao, with the assistance of all parties and the autumn harvest this year, the Hunan disaster can barely be overcome. However, most of the farmland has been abandoned, and the total harvest of the province is still less than 70%. Moreover, the people are in distress and have to sell new grains. Now, each stone (dan) is only sold for 4,000 yuan. The crisis of harming farmers is deeply worrying. This time, I am going to Nanjing to request the central government to allocate 10 billion yuan to purchase grain in Hunan Province to save the rural plight and to thank the people of Nanjing and Shanghai for their assistance.</p>
<h3>Developing Northeast Resources Presents a Once-in-a-Lifetime Opportunity; Mr. Zhang Yujiu's Remarks After Returning from Inspection</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, This City] The trade situation and economic conditions in the Northeast are of great concern to people in Shanghai. A reporter from the Central News Agency recently met with Mr. Zhang Yujiu, Director of the China Import and Export Trade Association and General Manager of the China Vegetable Oil Factory, who had just returned to Shanghai after a month-long inspection of the Northeast. According to him, the Northeast is rich in resources, and there are many emerging industries waiting to be developed. He believes that the key to economic development lies in the development of resources. Before the extraction of resources, a sufficient labor force is particularly needed. The Northeast certainly has favorable conditions for this. Since the recovery, the government has been working hard to manage and actively rectify the situation, making currency circulation, transportation, navigation, electricity, and shipping the current priorities. Regarding the long-pending issue of currency circulation, a solution has been found, and the Central Bank has announced a new exchange rate, which has been reported in various newspapers. During the military control period of the train, it is hoped that the train will be allocated for export goods to relieve the difficulties of businesses. If the Civil Aviation Administration opens up flights in addition to the Civil Aviation Administration, air transport will be smooth, and the special psychological can be dispelled. The issue of electricity is particularly important. No thick smoke is seen in Northeast factories. In the past, all electricity was supplied by the Yongji Small Manchurian Electric Factory, with a power generation capacity of 600,000 kilowatts. After repair, it can also reach 160,000 kilowatts. As for the issue of electricity passing through the CCP area, after consultation, it has been agreed that the factory will supply a portion of electricity to Harbin as an exchange condition, which has now been agreed upon. Electricity transmission will begin as soon as the power lines are laid. Transportation is the only factor in promoting trade. Yingkou, Huludao, and Qinhuangdao, the current three major seaports, can be reached by train, but there are few ships in the above-mentioned key locations, and the docks and warehouses have not been completed, resulting in soybeans, furs, etc. being piled up and unable to be transported into the customs as much as possible. Mr. Zhang continued: Although the authorities have reasonably allocated enemy and puppet factories to the central government, local governments, production bureaus, or private sectors according to their nature, as far as I have observed, those that have started work are only relying on the remaining raw materials on hand to maintain self-sufficiency. Normal operation and large-scale are very rare. If there is no overall planning, and production, capital, transportation, and sales are taken as the premise, once the raw materials are exhausted, the crisis is worrying. In the past, the enemy's grand plan was to match Northeast trade with the needs of the world and North China. Now that the Japanese vitality has not recovered and the political situation in Korea has not yet been incorporated into the norm, seizing the opportunity, expanding transportation, and strengthening development are once-in-a-lifetime opportunities. Britain, the United States, and Canada are short of soybeans, and North China is short of food. The annual output of soybeans in the customs can reach up to 6 million dan, and the remaining sorghum and millet can be exported to enrich the national treasury. In this way, the people's livelihood is favorable, and the government can also gain new vitality. He also solemnly stated that the Northeast production plan should be rebuilt quickly. The original technical personnel seem to be insufficient. Even MacArthur's supreme decision on the Far East to reduce the original 2 million Japanese population to 100,000, and now I heard that it will be reduced again to give us the opportunity to build ourselves, is admirable, but it is too far from the actual needs, we should catch up quickly, cooperate with the unfinished plan of the Japanese, and carry it forward to seize the world trade base, and hope that domestic industrial and commercial leaders will open their eyes and look at the Northeast, and then look at the Central Plains, it is like a drop in the ocean, a snail's land on the sea, let alone. If we can join hands to rise up and develop the Northeast, personal achievement, career development, and national prosperity are full of infinite new hopes.</p>

<h3>Taiwanese Japanese Publications to Cease Publication at Month's End</h3>
<p>The Taiwanese Tribute Mission Arrived in Shanghai Last Night</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 1st] The Taiwanese Tribute Mission is scheduled to leave Nanjing by train at 10:00 PM on the 1st for Shanghai and return to Taiwan.</p>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper, Nanjing, 1st] The Taiwan Restoration Tribute Mission hosted reporters at 5:00 PM on the 1st. According to reports: (1) Taiwanese compatriots have too high expectations for the motherland. The takeover work and current management are difficult to satisfy. However, after this mission came to Taiwan to severely punish corruption, the public sentiment has improved a lot. (2) The promotion of National Language education is progressing smoothly. Those over 30 years old have a good foundation in National Language, and those under 30 are working hard to learn. Generally, there is a high interest in learning National Language. When the Provincial Council of the Province meets in the first half of next year, it is expected to be in complete National Language. In addition, the Taiwan Provincial Government has ordered that all Japanese publications be discontinued from the 25th of this month (the anniversary of Taiwan's restoration). In the future, everything in Taiwan will gradually become consistent with the mainland.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The CCP's Memorandum</h3>
<p>The CCP delegation's memorandum was delivered to the government representatives yesterday morning and forwarded to President Chiang, demanding that the government immediately cease all military action against Zhangjiakou and its surroundings, otherwise, it would declare a complete breakdown and blame all the serious consequences on the government. We are used to hearing the CCP's verbal propaganda, and we are also used to seeing the CCP's statements and propositions. There are no novel elements in this memorandum, so we are not surprised; we, the common people, have been yearning for domestic peace and unity day and night, and of course, we also hope that the CCP government will turn swords into plowshares and turn evil customs into peace. However, after reading the CCP's memorandum, we have a few thoughts:</p>
<p>First, who caused the recent three months of war? Who should be responsible? The January 10th truce order was thoroughly broken by the CCP because the CCP established its so-called "Democratic Allied Forces" in the Northeast to prevent the National Army from entering to restore sovereignty, so that the truce could not be achieved. Let's put this aside for the moment; even with the government's second truce order on June 7th, it was also because the CCP believed in the omnipotence of force, not only refusing to comply with the plan to unify and reorganize its party army and hand it over to the state, but also continuing to destroy transportation, use troops to create chaos, and attempt to expand its territory and seize cities. The CCP army's siege of Datong, with meticulous planning, has not been for a day, which is a well-known fact; but the CCP said in the memorandum: "The CCP's battle for Datong is only to obstruct the advance of the Shanxi Guan Hu army and belongs to the nature of relieving the siege." Who would believe this? Everyone understands that the recent three months of war started from the CCP's siege of Datong.</p>
<p>Second, the CCP's request for the government to immediately cease military action against Zhangjiakou does not need to be threatened with a "declaration of complete breakdown." Because the door to negotiations between the KMT and the CCP is still wide open. In the past, negotiations were stagnant in the dispute over "three" and "five"; but since President Chiang returned to Nanjing, he has still expressed generosity to the CCP with his original intention of loving peace, and has accepted the compromise of mediator General Marshall, advocating that the three-person group and the five-person committee be held at the same time, so that military and political issues can be resolved at the same time. If the CCP truly has the sincerity of peace, as long as the CCP representative Zhou Enlai returns to Nanjing immediately to resume negotiations, not only the war in Zhangjiakou can be quelled, but also swords can be turned into plowshares throughout the country.</p>
<p>In short, the people long for peace, and the government seeks peace. As long as the CCP has the sincerity to "seek peace," all problems can be easily resolved. Why does the CCP need to exaggerate its words and threaten with a "complete breakdown"? Our common people's nerves have already been very tense and can no longer be stimulated by the CCP's war of nerves.</p>
<h3>Deliberation on the Prohibition of Rickshaws</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Government announced that it has been ordered to ban rickshaws, using a lottery method, expecting to complete the elimination in three years. This November, one-tenth of the rickshaws must be eliminated, including about 2,065 operating rickshaws and 630 private rickshaws. From the perspective of national dignity, we should support this policy.</p>
<p>Looking at the world, rickshaws are only found in Asia, and in Asia, the traces of rickshaws are gradually disappearing in countries with considerable status. For example, before the war, Japan was the place with the most rickshaws before it became a strong country. Once its national strength became strong, rickshaws disappeared. Travelers to Japan can only see a few rickshaws in Yokohama, and the rest of the cities such as Tokyo and Osaka are completely prohibited. Even in India under British rule, Mumbai has no rickshaws at all, Madras has few, and only Calcutta has a considerable number of rickshaws. Outside of India, there are still many rickshaws in countries that are still in colonial status, such as Myanmar, Malaysia, and Vietnam. Since China is an independent and large country, and it shoulders the heavy responsibility of stabilizing world peace in Asia, it should no longer retain this shameful characteristic of a colony. From an international perspective, we do not support China still having rickshaws forever.</p>
<p>From a humanitarian point of view, we also do not support the existence of rickshaws in China. People are born to eat, but there are many ways to eat. Pulling rickshaws, acting like cattle and horses, the existence of this system in society has invisibly deprived these laborers of the noble personality they should have in form, reduced the self-esteem of these many poor citizens, and actually weakened the spiritual strength of the country, thereby making the national strength not consolidated. Therefore, if China wants to become a country with the same status as Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, the reason for banning rickshaws is sufficient. Moreover, when rickshaw pullers are working, they run forward pulling the rickshaw, panting like cows, sweating profusely. In summer, they are baked by the scorching sun, and in winter, they are attacked by the cold wind. The climatic damage to their bodies is even more unnecessary to say. The country naturally has no need to preserve this inhuman way of life at the lower level. We have nothing to say about the government's ban on rickshaws in this regard.</p>
<p>What is worrying is that in today's period and situation, is it completely appropriate in terms of time to severely and immediately ban rickshaws? In today's post-war era, preventing unemployment is the most important issue for governments around the world. Britain, the United States, France, and other countries personally received a serious and indelible lesson from the national unemployment after the end of World War I. Therefore, even before the end of this war, they used all possible means to study how to reduce unemployment. Sure enough, thanks to this effort, at least at present, Allied countries such as Britain and the United States have not encountered any difficulties caused by unemployment. Their government authorities have rich experience in dealing with this problem. They know that an increase in the number of people in the country will make politics more complex and make the economy more vulnerable to recession.</p>
<p>On the contrary, all our measures, whether intentional or unintentional, seem to be working hard to create unemployment. Since the victory, only one year has passed, many institutions have been abolished, and countless unemployed people have been added. Many factories have closed down, and many more unemployed people have been added. Street vendors have been banned, and an unknown number of unemployed people have been created out of thin air. Now we are going to ban rickshaws across the country, which is a more widespread agitation of the anxiety of this vast group of laborers. China's political situation is now in such turmoil that it is appropriate to seek stability for a while, first get an opportunity to live and work in peace, and then seek progress. At this time, rushing to ban rickshaws across the country seems to be incompatible with the objective environment of politics.</p>
<p>It does not seem to be the most appropriate time to ban rickshaws today. Therefore, we hope that the administrative authorities can postpone it for the time being, or it is better to postpone it for the time being. If it must be done, then in the banning, all measures must be balanced and appropriate. Do not rush it too much, and do not punish it too severely, so that the spirit of these laborers will not be stimulated too much. Make sure that after the ban, their eating problem, although not completely settled, at least a part of it has a practical solution. The implementation of a good policy often has great difficulties. This is what we know. We hope that the government will adopt a solemn and stable method in order to gradually achieve this progressive state of "no rickshaws in China."</p>
<h3>International Cultural and Educational Cooperation</h3>
<p>The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization is about to convene in Paris. The United States Department of State, in preparation for participating in this international conference, specially convened the National Commission on Educational, Scientific and Cultural Affairs in Washington D.C. When President Truman received the members of the commission, he greatly praised and encouraged the cause of international cultural and educational cooperation, writing: "I believe that the contribution of the Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization to world peace will be no less than that of other organizations related to the United Nations. This organization will awaken our strength to strive for peace. When we understand the viewpoints of others and others understand ours, we will be able to engage in discussions, thereby discarding various differences. If we have no understanding, we have no peace; if we have no education, we have no peace..." It can be seen that regarding international cultural and educational cooperation, the United States, from President Truman down, pays close attention to it and places earnest expectations on it.</p>
<p>In the reconstruction of the world's peaceful order, indeed no effort is as fundamental as international cultural and educational cooperation. The reason for conflicts between countries lies in the lack of understanding between people; to increase mutual understanding between people, the key lies in enhancing international cultural and educational cooperation. This is a cultural issue, an educational issue. Humanity should understand that people live in various different cultural environments. While we should certainly improve the cultural standards of humanity, we must also remember that the formation of various cultural environments each has its historical background, and we must have the understanding and tolerance to accommodate other cultural lives. If we believe that our own cultural life is lofty and force others to conform to it, this turns into an abhorrent Kultur. This unpleasant name symbolizes the militarism of Prussia and the Nazism of Hitler in the past. The purpose of international cultural and educational cooperation is to promote understanding and cooperation between nations within the cultures of each nation. The reason why world peace is threatened is mainly that the cultural life of a certain nation, including its thoughts and behaviors, is imposed by force on people who do not belong to that nation. The German warlords did this, and the Japanese warlords did this as well. Mankind's awakening after two world wars should be sought in international cultural cooperation. This is why President Truman said when receiving members of the U.S. National Commission on Educational, Scientific and Cultural Affairs: "If we have no understanding, we have no peace; if we have no education, we have no peace."</p>
<p>The responsibility that China bears in international cultural and educational cooperation is arduous. We are an ancient country of culture, and although we may be relatively backward in science and technology, we originally had our treasures in spiritual culture. Since China's interaction with the world, the cultural heritage left by our wise ancestors, although some small parts of it have been introduced to the West, just fragments, the complete picture of our entire national culture is not yet well known to the world. Therefore, at this time, we should especially devote ourselves to the promotion of our national culture, so that the thoughts and doctrines of our ancestors such as Confucius and Mencius, like Aristotle, can also become a part of the world's cultural heritage, and increase the world's understanding of our country. Therefore, we should pay special attention to the position we occupy in international cultural and educational cooperation.</p>
<p>Because of this important relationship, and in view of the fact that the United States has a National Commission on Educational, Scientific and Cultural Affairs, we believe that when our country prepares to participate in international cultural and educational cooperation, we should also have a similar organization domestically. Regarding international cultural and educational cooperation, we know that this is the scope of the Ministry of Education's authority; however, since the Ministry of Education is an administrative agency, it seems that a National Commission on Educational, Scientific and Cultural Affairs similar to that of the United States should be established outside or under the Ministry of Education, jointly organized by the Academia Sinica, the Peking Academy, various famous universities, the Central Cultural Movement Committee, and other relevant parties such as museums, libraries, or scientific societies, to focus on participating in international cultural and educational cooperation as its main business. For example, regarding the establishment of a mathematics center by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization in China, whether it should be located in Nanjing along with the capital or set up elsewhere, could be decided through discussions by this organization. International cultural and educational cooperation is not only related to educational administration, but also related to national policy everywhere.</p>
<p>In short, international cultural and educational cooperation is indeed a very important task. The position our country occupies in this work is particularly important, and others have particularly earnest expectations of us. Therefore, we should especially have excellent performance in participating in this work, in order to increase the world's understanding of us.</p>

<h3>New Embezzlement Discoveries in Hubei's Takeover Involve Wang Dongyuan and Two Former Ministers of Finance; Investigation Team from Nanjing and Jiangsu to Complete Work in Wuxi</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Hankou 1st Dispatch] The Hubei, Hunan, and Jiangxi Area Investigation Team yesterday late at night released another report on Hubei Provincial Government's illegal takeover and handling of materials. They believe that former Chairman Wang Dongyuan, Minister of Finance Wu Songqing, and Director of the Hankou Alcohol Factory Shi Lingsheng, as well as Director of the Construction Department Tan Yuequan, cannot escape responsibility and should be thoroughly investigated and dealt with according to the law. The inside story of the case is recorded as follows: (1) Regarding the Provincial Government's Materials Takeover and Handling Committee: (A) It established a takeover agency without legal basis; (B) It privately handled a huge amount of taken over materials, totaling more than 30 batches. Without public bidding or legal procedures, only Wu Songqing, Zheng Nanxuan, and 10 others privately made decisions; (C) It gave a 20% kickback to the purchasing agencies, causing the state to lose at least 57 million yuan; (D) Purchasing stores were also given a 20% kickback, and more than 500,000 yuan in overcharged payments were found, and it is unknown into whose hands they fell; (E) The proceeds from the sale of materials were illegally used up, and a portion was secretly deposited in a bank to collect interest, and the deposit interest was privately transferred in violation of the contract; (F) A large amount of materials were missing during the handover. The main culprit, Section Chief Ye Jingxiong of the Secretariat, fled. The Provincial Government deliberately failed to thoroughly investigate, which is obviously intentional protection. (2) Regarding the Hankou Alcohol Factory, the director, Shi Lingsheng, took over more than 20 large and small factories and illegally sold a large amount of materials. Everything was not made public internally or externally, and the selling price of the materials was only half of the market price, enriching himself at the expense of the state, causing the state to lose at least 200 million yuan.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Suzhou 1st Dispatch] Fan Yusui, leader of the Nanjing-Suzhou Team of the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui Area Takeover Investigation Team, and committee members Wu Cangzhou, Du Guang'ao, Wu Zhenya, and others, led all team members to Wuxi the day before yesterday to begin their investigation, which is nearing completion. The team specially notified the local Enemy Property Suzhou Branch and other relevant agencies that they are scheduled to arrive in Suzhou on the 5th and ordered them to quickly prepare and provide detailed reports of all original registers, details of the takeover, and handling process for investigation. All takeover agencies in Suzhou are currently rushing to complete this overnight.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Guangzhou 1st Dispatch] The Guangdong-Guangxi Area Takeover Investigation Team recently learned that the Guangdong Good Relief Branch Fishing Industry General Office is suspected of embezzlement in the takeover of enemy fishing boats. It was found that the office was originally an affiliate of the Good Relief Branch, but the branch had previously issued a notice to disassociate itself from the office. The office has been presided over by Director-General Gao Guangjing, who, in the name of the Good Relief Branch Fishing Industry General Office, received six fishing boats from the director of the Supply Bureau of the Logistics Department. Gao rented them to others for smuggling and business. The investigation team believes that according to the charter of the Fishing Industry General Association, the takeover of enemy and puppet fishing boats was originally for the purpose of relieving fishermen and developing the fishing industry, but Gao openly embezzled them, so they sent the evidence to the Office of the Commander-in-Chief and requested that he be detained. Gao has directly admitted the embezzlement without denial.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] It is reported that the Japanese left behind 300 fishing boats in Guangdong, including 200 over 1,000 tons and the rest tens of tons each. The agencies that have taken over them include 19 from the Guangxi Provincial Government, more than 20 from the China Merchants Bureau, 36 from the Fishing Industry General Office, and 22 from the Commissioner's Office of the Ministry of Military and Political Affairs, totaling only about 100 boats. The whereabouts of the remaining 200 are unknown. The investigation team is now preparing to investigate.</p>
<h3>Local Order Gradually Restored in Counties Recovered in Southwest Shandong; Emergency Relief Work Launched in Huaiyin Area</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Jinan 30th Dispatch] The situation of the National Army in southwestern Shandong continues to expand, and the local order in the recovered county towns is gradually being restored. According to reports obtained by the government, the Communist Army's recent military conference decided to order Ta Yong, commander of the Third Column of the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Military Region, to lead 60,000 men to firmly defend the southern area of Fan County along the old course of the Yellow River, waiting for the National Army to reach the Yellow River Golden Dike in southern Juancheng, and then launch a general counterattack. It also ordered Gao Shuxun's troops to transfer to the area east of Jinan to harass the western section of the Jiaoji Railway. The movement of Communist troops in the suburbs of Caozhou and Jining is still busy and constantly in contact with the National Army.</p>
<p>(Our Newspaper Zhenjiang Dispatch) After the recovery of Huaiyin, it was ravaged and full of refugees, urgently awaiting relief. It is heard that the Jiangsu-Nanjing Branch especially, on the second day after the recovery of Huaiyin, in addition to assigning team members Wu Fan and Holmes to bring 200 tons of flour and 40,000 pieces of old clothing to Huaiyin and the counties under the jurisdiction of the Huaiyin Area in conjunction with the UNRRA area office to handle emergency relief, also telegraphed the head office to quickly allocate a large number of relief supplies to meet emergency needs. The Executive Yuan has ordered the Jiangsu-Nanjing Branch to take over the post-disaster relief work in various counties of the Huaiyin Area. The branch has decided to establish an office in Huaiyin to promote various businesses nearby, and has sent Zhang Tongmo to lead several relief workers and technical experts to prepare for the work and actively carry it out, and has allocated many vehicles for use in the area.</p>
<h3>Anqing Establishes Milk Stations to Benefit Students and the Poor</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Anqing Dispatch] Since the Righteous People Evacuation Station, the Anqing Warehouse, the Righteous People Dormitory, the First Mobile Treatment Team, and the river embankment construction engineering team were successively ordered to be established in this port and actively promoted, they have benefited the disaster victims immensely in terms of relief supplies, diagnosis of the poor, and embankment construction. However, these relief supplies, such as milk, trotters, and oatmeal, are filled in the East Gate and the major Southern Goods stores in Sipailou, which is eye-catching. It only provides profit for merchants, which is detrimental to the original purpose of the agency. In order to prevent future leakage and sale of various materials and directly benefit the disaster victims, the Good Relief Branch specially sent Yuan Guohai, a cadre, leading a nutritional work team of three people, who arrived in this port from Tongcheng on the agency's special car on the afternoon of the 27th and stayed at the Lai'an Hotel on Lüba Street. It is learned that the agency plans to establish three milk stations in this city, entrusting the Relief Institute, Tongren Hospital, and Righteous People Evacuation Station and other three agencies to handle them separately, and establish a nutrition room, divided into four nutritional work teams, to carry out distribution and supervision work in different areas. The working area of the first team is the three counties of Tongcheng, Huaining, and Shucheng. Currently, the distributed materials are limited to milk. The distribution targets are students of primary and secondary schools and the general poor people awaiting feeding. The elderly are those over 60 years old, and the young children are those under 12 years old. Each person is given one pound of milk per day. If the relief supplies are supplied continuously in the future, they will be distributed to the counties for a long time.</p>
<h3>Yinfeng Road Bridge Collapses; Ningbo Fish Market Established</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Ningbo Dispatch] The recent continuous autumn rain and mountain torrents in this port caused the Yuanzhen Bridge on Yinfeng Road to be damaged on the evening of the 25th. The bridge collapsed and the wooden piles were shaking. After learning about this, the Yinfeng Automobile Company reported to Yang Jian, the director of the Provincial Transportation Department, who came to Yong to inspect the highway. After verifying that it was true, Director Yang immediately sent two urgent telegrams, one to Minister Yu and one to Director Fang of the Highway Administration, reporting the destruction and requesting a quick allocation of 40 million yuan in repair funds. According to Director Yang, although the request has been telegraphed to the central government, it is difficult to determine when it will arrive. He (Director Yang) will return to the province on the 27th to report to Chairman Shen and request that the provincial funds be allocated first or borrowed from the governments of Yinfeng counties in advance so that construction can be started earlier.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] The Ningbo Fish Market, ordered to be jointly operated by the government and merchants, has been renamed Co., Ltd. After active reorganization, the establishment meeting was held at the Siming Telephone Company on the 26th to discuss the charter and elect directors and supervisors.

Yu, Zhou Dalie was elected as a supervisor. The directors and supervisors of the government shares will be appointed after reporting to the province.</p>
<h3>Hefei City Reconstruction Stipulates Street and Lane Widths</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Hefei Dispatch] The provincial government has determined that Hefei is the temporary provincial capital and decided to complete the construction of Hefei, organizing the Municipal Engineering Office to preside over the work. However, because the city area was destroyed by the enemy and the houses were destroyed, merchants and residents are rebuilding their houses. In order to avoid widening the streets in the future and demolishing them again, the provincial government specially stipulated the standards for widening the streets and the setback methods for buildings on both sides, which have been announced to be followed. The content divides the width of the city's streets and lanes into five grades: the first grade is 12 meters, the second grade is 10.5 meters, the third grade is 8.5 meters, the fourth grade is 5.5 meters, and the fifth grade is 3.5 meters. The major streets in the west, south, and north are listed as the first grade, the prosperous urban areas, such as Hou Dajie, Shangjie Lou, Liulou Street, Shizi Street, and Dong Dajie, are listed as the second grade, to reduce losses, Fanxiangkou, Nanmen Street, Sipailou South Street and other remote streets are listed as the third grade, Youfang Lane, Huayuan Lane, Caobing Lane, Sigu Lane, Wushenglou Lane and others are listed as the fourth grade, and other small alleys are listed as the fifth grade.</p>
<h3>Yiyao's Continuous Autumn Rain Damages Cotton Fields</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Yuyao Dispatch] The cotton fields in the northern area of Yao cover 750,000 mu. During the war, due to insufficient self-sufficiency in grain, 5% of them were converted to sweet potatoes. After the victory, the price of cotton rose and it was restored to its original state. Unexpectedly, there was a severe drought this year, and the cotton bolls were not well formed. Since autumn, there has been continuous rain, and the accumulated water is a foot deep, resulting in root rot, which has shown signs of poor harvest. Cotton farmers are worried.</p>
<h3>Large-Scale Suppression of Lake Bandits; Deployment Decided by the Suppression Conference; Bandit Troops Near Mucheng Town Attempt to Stir Up Trouble</h3>
<p>[Suzhou Dispatch] The Taihu Lake Area Suppression Conference has been convened for several days, and all relevant suppression issues have been decided. The conference closed on the afternoon of the 30th. Military and political personnel from the relevant counties have returned to their posts. It is heard that a large-scale suppression operation will be officially launched within days.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Suzhou 1st Dispatch] At about 3:00 p.m. on the 1st, the Taihu Lake Suppression Headquarters received intelligence that more than 100 troops of unknown numbers, equipped with long and short guns, were suddenly discovered in Shanrenqiao Town, 12 miles west of Mucheng Town, and they were buying daily necessities in Guangfu Town in groups. The headquarters sent cadres to conduct secret reconnaissance on the ground and confirmed that they had fled from the Xishan area at dawn that day. It was the Cai Sanle troops of the "New Fourth Army". It is said that they had threatened to loot Guangfu Town. However, the headquarters observed that Shanrenqiao Town is only 10 miles away from Xukou Town, and the Liao Bingnan surrender troops of Taihu Lake are being concentrated at the Xukou point for reorganization under orders. Cai's troops had previously sent personnel to contact Liao's troops to join the New Fourth Army without success. Now that the government is incorporating them, they may be unwilling and attempt to obstruct or attack Liao's troops, which is highly likely. Therefore, the Taihu Lake Suppression Department has taken emergency measures. In addition to ordering half of Liao's troops to stay on land and half along the lake shore to form a mutually supportive position, it has also transferred elite troops to strengthen the defense of Guangfu Town, and has also secretly deployed sentry soldiers on various roads to respond at any time. The department originally intended to encircle and suppress them, but it feared alarming the snake and wasting efforts. Currently, the residents of Guangfu are panicking and preparing for defense.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Suzhou 30th Dispatch] After the two commanders, Ma and Xu, of the Yangcheng Area Suppression Headquarters actively planned various implementation methods in the past few days, they have strictly ordered the Kunshan and Changshu command posts under their command to start promoting them immediately. It is learned that in order to implement unification of local party, government, and military affairs and to coordinate the suppression mission, the Changshu West Area Command Post, decided by Commander Guo Zhichi and Deputy Commander Pan Yichen, the county magistrate, will set off on the 1st to inspect the areas around Dongtang City, Bacheng, and the border area between Kunshan and Taicang on the edge of Yangcheng Lake, and to cooperate with military implementation, check household registration, and organize Baos and Jias. At the same time, propaganda teams will be dispatched to go deep into the people to promote the government's attention to the kindness of recruitment. It is heard that Guo and Pan plan to inspect for a week.</p>
<p>[Wuxi Dispatch] According to military sources: Jin Jiarang, a staff officer of the First Pacification District Headquarters, recruited Liao Bingnan's lake bandits, more than 100 of whom were concentrated on Sanshan. On the 29th, he and Commander Fu Jingfang went to Xukou to reorganize them. The necessary clothing and supplies had already been transported to Mucheng.</p>
<p>(Wuxi Dispatch) Recruitment Commissioner Yang Yanbin is ill in Mucheng. The bandits of Platform Mountain are concentrated on Sanshan awaiting orders. Other bandits continue to rob as usual. On the afternoon of the 22nd and the evening of the 23rd, Dongshan Township, Xishan, and Exiang Mountain were robbed one after another, and nine out of ten houses were empty. The bandits are furious because the wealthy households on Hengshan have no news of the ransom for the ticket of the son, even with the mother's ticket worth 20 million yuan. The residents of the entire mountain are panicking. If they are not suppressed quickly, the nearby residents will be in danger.</p>
<h3>Suzhou Arrests Flying Thief Who Possesses Superb Vaulting Skills</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Suzhou Dispatch] Kaitai Clothing Store on Hulong Street in this county was stolen from in the late night of September 17, resulting in a loss of more than 10 million yuan. After reporting to the Criminal Police Team for investigation, the cadres determined after inspection and investigation that the thief must have entered over the high wall and must have special skills and was not done by one person. Cao Anchang, the captain of the Criminal Police Team, strictly supervised his subordinates and set a time limit to solve the case. After more than ten days of precise investigation, the First Squadron stationed outside the Lümen Gate obtained clues. On the morning of the 29th, the suspect, Little Monk, was arrested and interrogated first. According to his confession: the case was committed by Quan Cai, who was hiding at Student Alley No. 34. Liu Suye, who paddles the boat, has a superb skill: he can fly over high walls with a long bamboo pole. He has committed crimes many times, but because he can leave no traces, none of the cases have been solved. Several criminal police officers disguised themselves and went to the address. When they rushed into the room, the thief Liu realized that something was wrong. He hurriedly grabbed a bamboo pole and ran to the roof, hoping to fly over and escape. Fortunately, the criminal police bravely stepped forward and arrested him. In his home, the original goods of Kaitai Clothing Store, estimated to be worth 4 million yuan, were searched out. Both the person and the stolen goods were taken to the headquarters on the morning of the 30th for verification. During the interview, the reporter asked Captain Cao of the Criminal Police Team, who said that there are not many thieves with this so-called flying skill today. Now that he has been arrested, otherwise the Suzhou bourgeoisie will have no peaceful days.</p>
<h3>A Township Head in Suzhou Dies Tragically; Killed by Xue Yonghui's Troops of the "New Fourth Army"</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Suzhou Dispatch] A shocking murder case occurred in Yaoshe Township, Xiangshan, the third district of the county, at 4:00 p.m. on September 27. The victim was Township Head Yao Fuxiang. His family came to the city to request an exemption from inspection, which was not approved. Liu, the prosecutor of the local court, led the coroner Wang Chunrong to the township in plain clothes on the morning of the 29th for an inspection. It was not until about 7:00 p.m. that he returned to the court to report. After inquiring about the inside details from various sources, the reporter learned that Yao Fuxiang originally opened a grain store in the area and served as the township head during the enemy and puppet era. Because the township is located on the edge of Taihu Lake, it is an area where Xue Yonghui's troops of the New Fourth Army operate. They had ordered him to collect land taxes on their behalf and were able to pay them monthly. After the Japanese surrendered, Yao continued to serve as township head and stopped collecting land taxes. Xue Yonghui repeatedly sent people to contact him, intending to continue collecting them. Yao prevaricated. Later, due to the urgency of the situation, he had no choice but to flee to Shanghai to settle down. Not long ago, he secretly returned to his hometown to run his old business, but Xue Yonghui found out and sent several subordinates, disguised as customers, entered Yao's store under the pretext of buying oil, shot him dead, and fled one after another. After the tragedy, the local military authorities paid great attention to it. They are now deploying countermeasures.</p>

<h3>Hubei Province Disaster Relief Materials: Also Being Transported to Communist Areas</h3>
<p>[Our Hankou Dispatch, 30th] Yang Xiandong, Deputy Director of the Executive Yuan's Hubei Branch, received reporters this afternoon at 5:00 PM and reported on the recent work of the branch.

Creditors have been demanding repayment fiercely. Zheng Zhipei, the firm's manager, was unable to cope and fled without a trace last night. The creditors are currently searching for him everywhere.

<h3>Traitor Chen Fumin Dies of Illness</h3>
<p>[Our Suzhou Dispatch, 30th] Chen Fumin, the former president of the puppet Jiangsu High Court, was 72 years old. He was previously sentenced to life imprisonment by the Jiangsu High Court and imprisoned in the Third Prison. Recently, his old heart disease recurred. The prison doctor's treatment was ineffective.

<h3>Appeal from Dockworkers in Pudong</h3>
<p>The wages of dockworkers in Shanghai are meager due to layer upon layer of exploitation by contractors. The fact that contractors exploit the interests of workers is known to millions of citizens in Shanghai. In the past, dockworkers were controlled and manipulated by contractor bosses, and workers had no way to complain. Director Wu of the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs, since taking office, has spared no effort to alleviate the suffering of laborers. Our genuine dockworkers are organizing a genuine dockworkers' union, and the principle of preparing separately in each district has been approved. Vice Director Li even stated that he will investigate the wages of dockworkers to prevent contractors from exploiting them layer upon layer, which proves that the director and vice director are alleviating the suffering of dockworkers by addressing both the symptoms and the root cause. We dockworkers are grateful and tell our sons and brothers, as if seeing the blue sky through the clouds. Therefore, representatives of dockworkers from various docks in Pudong initiated the organization of the Pudong District Dockworkers' Union. However, large and small contractors must participate in the organization, and even the so-called Thirty-Six Gang has stepped forward to organize branches to confront the workers, compete for leadership, and oppress fellow workers. The union's work is being disrupted in every way, and a bloody tragedy is bound to occur. At present, tens of thousands of dockworkers in Pudong District are living in dire straits. In addition to submitting reports to the competent authorities, we also request assistance from people of all walks of life who uphold justice. (A tearful appeal from the representatives of all dockworkers in Pudong District)</p>
<h3>Why is the Garment Industry Raising Prices Again?</h3>
<p>To the Editor: The local garment industry raised prices by 70% in June. Then, on the 11th of this month, it suddenly raised prices by another 60% for no reason. It is said that this has been approved by the Bureau of Social Affairs. The repeated price increases in the garment industry have a significant impact on the clothing of our citizens. Moreover, prices have not increased by 60% in the past three months. Therefore, this price increase is extremely unreasonable. It is hoped that the authorities will pay attention to it. It is also hoped that the garment industry trade union will clarify the reasons for the 60% price increase. (Tao Xun)</p>
<h3>Swapping Money on the Street</h3>
<p>On August 26th, Mr. Zhang was holding 300,000 yuan in national currency and was shopping at a fruit stall on Tianzhutang Street. Three men resembling soldiers approached and asked Mr. Zhang to exchange banknotes. Zhang did not suspect anything and agreed. Unexpectedly, they suddenly snatched 100,000 yuan from Mr. Zhang's hand, which was then recovered. When he returned home and counted the large denominations, there were no mistakes. But after carefully counting the small denominations, he realized that most of them were small bills of five or ten yuan, resulting in a loss of 90,000 yuan in national currency. This matter is thought to have been done by unscrupulous individuals. While the impact of the loss on Mr. Zhang is small, the matter involves deception, and I dare to ask the authorities to strictly arrest these unscrupulous individuals to deter others from following suit.

<h3>Bicycle Licenses Are Being Rushed into Production</h3>
<p>A letter from the Municipal Bureau of Finance of this city states: "The letter from the Bureau of Public Utilities, Municipal Public (35) Secret No. 9958, states: 'The Shen Bao has forwarded a letter from Xu Zhonghan requesting a reply regarding the date of issuing small bicycle license plates. The manufacture, issuance, and collection of fees for these license plates are handled by your bureau. Please review and reply accordingly.' " With this approval, the small bicycle license plates for the first half of this year have already been manufactured and delivered to various district tax collection offices for distribution. Regarding the small license plates for the second half of the year, the processing procedures have taken a long time, resulting in failure to issue them as scheduled. They are currently being rushed into production by the manufacturer. As soon as they are manufactured and sent to the bureau, a public announcement will be made regarding the scheduled issuance. This letter is for your information and for forwarding. Sincerely, to the Shen Bao.</p>
<h3>Urgent Need for a Bank in Sijing Town</h3>
<p>To whom it may concern: Sijing Town in western Shanghai is the leading town in Songjiang County and is also the hub of the Shanghai-Songjiang-Qingpu waterway. Moreover, it is rich in agricultural products from the surrounding countryside, so the rice industry is developed and there are many rice mills. All industries are also thriving because of this. Since the victory, all industries have resumed business one after another. However, financial services are still lacking, making it extremely difficult to adjust the funds of various businesses. Often, Business A has a large sum of money but nowhere to temporarily deposit it, while Business B needs a large sum of money but lacks access to borrowing. This causes the money supply to tighten, which has an infinite impact on the market. In minor matters, if merchants want to remit money to other ports, they must go to Shanghai, wasting travel expenses and time. These two inconveniences alone show that the town urgently needs the establishment of a financial institution. Moreover, it is guaranteed that business will develop. I am making this request to the Shanghai Banking Association on behalf of the merchants and people of the entire town, hoping that you will encourage your member banks to send personnel to Sijing to investigate. If it can be confirmed that this is a factual need, and a branch office can be established in our town, all sectors will feel the convenience. (Qin Mingqi and Qian Shenyu, merchants and residents of Sijing Town)</p>

<h3>Final Fate of German War Criminals Decided: Nuremberg Tribunal Ends; Von Papen Held Reception for Reporters Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Paris, 1st (Radio): Nuremberg dispatch - Today is the second day of the court's sentencing, and the final fate of the Nazi war criminals has been decided. At 3:40 PM, Presiding Judge Lawrence announced the adjournment and expressed his gratitude to the jury. With this, the eight Allied judges have completed their duties, and the mission of the International Military Tribunal has come to an end.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Nuremberg, 1st] The indictment of the International Military Tribunal against German war criminals listed four major charges. Those who committed all four crimes would inevitably face the death penalty. Those who did not commit all four crimes or did not fall under the four crimes had room for leniency. The four major charges are: (1) common conspiracy against peace; (2) crimes against peace, namely launching aggressive wars in violation of national treaties, agreements, and promises; (3) crimes of war, namely violating the Hague International Conventions; (4) crimes against humanity.</p>
<p>Another telegram stated that the International Military Tribunal announced this morning that the charges against the 22 German war criminals (one of whom was tried in absentia) are as follows: A. Six who committed all four crimes: former Air Force Marshal Göring, former Foreign Minister Ribbentrop, former Army Chief of Staff Keitel, former Reich Protector of Bohemia and Moravia Neurath, Nazi soldier Rosenberg, and Jodl. B. Four who committed three crimes: former Navy Commander-in-Chief Dönitz and Raeder, former Economics Minister Funk, and former Reich Protector of Bohemia and Moravia Frick. C. Eight who committed two crimes: former Nazi Party Representative Hess, former Labor Front leader Sauckel, former Head of the Austrian Secret Police Kaltenbrunner, former Governor-General of the General Government of Poland Frank, Nazi propagandist Streicher, former Governor of Austria and the occupied Netherlands Seyss-Inquart, former Minister of Armaments Speer, and Hitler's deceased representative Bormann. D. One who committed one crime: former Hitler Youth leader Schirach. E. Three who were acquitted: former Ambassador to Turkey von Papen, former Stormtrooper leader Fritzsche, and former Nazi Party financier Schacht.</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Paris, 1st (Emergency Radio): Nuremberg dispatch - Von Papen, Schacht, and Fritzsche, who were acquitted by the Nuremberg Tribunal, will hold a press conference at 3:00 PM today.</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Paris, 1st (Radio): Nuremberg dispatch - Von Papen, Schacht, and Fritzsche held a reception for reporters this afternoon. Von Papen declared that his political life had been quite tortuous and that he was not as fortunate as his friend Schacht, and that he currently had no fixed plans. Whether he will immediately go to the French-occupied area to be with his wife, or to Hamburg in the British-occupied area where his daughter is located, he could not yet predict. When a reporter asked whether he would still be released as the Third Reich's number one veteran diplomat, he smiled and said: "Gentlemen, there is no doubt." Von Papen concluded by saying that because he had been isolated from the free outside world for too long, he was unable to announce his future plans to everyone today.</p>

<h3>Different Expressions at the Moment of Sentencing: Göring Retreated Quickly with an Arrogant Demeanor; Hess Looked Up at the Sky as if Moved; Fritzsche Cried and Laughed Upon Being Acquitted</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Paris, 1st (Radio): Nuremberg dispatch - Final reports from the courtroom: Streicher showed no reaction when the sentence was read, and his face was expressionless. Funk's eyes were wide open, and his face was stunned. He was helped down the stairs by military police and walked towards the prison gate. Dönitz and Keitel stood upright and listened to the sentence without showing any emotion. Raeder seemed shocked but quickly withdrew. Most of the defendants were indifferent when the sentence was read, as if they did not understand what was being said. While Presiding Judge Lawrence was reading the crimes committed by each defendant, the defendants stood still and waited, as if still expecting something, until the military police signaled them to leave the courtroom one by one. Sauckel looked even more fierce, and the death penalty seemed unexpected to him. After hearing the sentence, Göring quickly retreated, so there was not enough time to observe his reaction. He immediately took off his hat and handed it to the military police, his expression like that of a high-ranking minister. Hess refused to accept the hat handed to him by the military police and stared at the ceiling, as if he had not understood the sentence because it was read in English. After hearing the sentence, General Jodl hung his head dejectedly, as if resigned to fate. Speer looked satisfied when he learned that he was only sentenced to 20 years in prison. Neurath maintained the demeanor of a veteran diplomat with a solemn expression.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Nuremberg, 1st] In the last court session today, the International Tribunal separately determined the sentences of the defendants. Although those who were convicted tried to appear calm, their unease was revealed on their faces. Among them, Fritzsche's crying and laughing was particularly comical. He was once a radio propagandist and was good at acting. When he first heard the judge announce that he was innocent, he was deeply moved. But when he heard that his friend Bormann was convicted, tears welled up in his eyes. Then he realized that Bormann was only being tried in absentia and there was no major problem, so he laughed through his tears again. When the court adjourned, the convicted people surrounded Schacht, von Papen, and Fritzsche to celebrate their acquittal. Speer shook hands with Schacht for a long time, as this would be the last time the two would shake hands.</p>
<h3>Key Points of the Judgment: Aggression is the Greatest Crime</h3>
<p>[United Press, Nuremberg, 30th] The International Military Tribunal today read part of the judgment, the key points of which are as follows:</p>
<p>Crimes in violation of international law are committed by people (not abstract entities). Only by punishing individual criminals can the provisions of international law be implemented. Individuals have international responsibilities, which transcend the obligation to obey the state. Germany accepted dictatorship and all its terror and contemptuous methods, and openly denied the rule of law. Hitler, in his book "Mein Kampf," fully explained his ambitions to prepare for aggression. Germany's launch of war against Poland was a blatant war of aggression. The attacks on Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg were without reason. Germany also meticulously planned to destroy the Soviet Union and prevent it from becoming a political and military power. The claim that the Soviet Union intended to attack Germany is unbelievable. The possibility of directly attacking the United States was considered as a future event. Ribbentrop himself urged Yosuke Matsuoka to have Japan fight against Britain and the United States. In addition, the statute of the court stipulated that planning or engaging in a war of aggression or a war in violation of international treaties is a criminal act. The court ruled that some defendants were guilty of planning and engaging in wars of aggression against twelve countries, and therefore committed the above-mentioned crimes. As officials of the German government, all or at least some of the defendants should have known that Germany had signed various treaties prohibiting the use of war to resolve international disputes. Most of the defendants claimed that they were acting on Hitler's orders and could not be held responsible for the crimes committed in carrying out the orders. However, Article 8 of the court's statute stipulates that a defendant's actions on the orders of the government or superiors should not relieve him of his responsibility, but may be considered in reducing punishment. Considering the differences in the criminal law of most countries, the real key lies not in the issue of orders, but in the issue of moral choice.</p>
<h3>The Nuremberg Tribunal's Solemn Verdict: Creating a Precedent for the Trial of Japanese War Criminals; Collusion in Aggression and Crimes Against Humanity Are Unavoidable</h3>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 1st] The Nuremberg Tribunal's solemn verdict on German war criminals will have a significant impact on the Tokyo International Tribunal's trial of the 27 Japanese defendants. The precedent set by the Nuremberg Tribunal in legal principles strikes at the Japanese defendants' argument that the militarists were deceived by patriotism and attempted to save the country from an intractable situation and are therefore innocent. Most of the Japanese defendants have apparently given up hope of being acquitted, but will ultimately argue that the United States and the Allies drove Japan to war. Official opinions cannot be ascertained for the time being, but according to observers, since the Nuremberg Tribunal has specifically determined the existence of various crimes, the war of aggression, and the German-Japanese conspiracy, any attempt to defend oneself on the grounds of national self-defense will remain very bleak. Yosuke Matsuoka, the former Japanese Foreign Minister and one of the main protagonists of the German-Japanese conspiracy, has already died of illness and cannot be held accountable. Other important defendants include former Ambassador to Germany Oshima, who was mentioned in documents in both courts. The Nuremberg Tribunal's verdict confirms the brutality and crimes of senior officials in violation of humanity. The prosecution here particularly values this. The Japanese war criminals include those who have committed numerous evils, from Tojo to Matsui, the protagonist of the Nanjing Massacre. The Nuremberg Tribunal's conviction of several Nazi Party organizations does not directly affect Japan at present. It is heard that the prosecution here has discussed trying all personnel of Japanese agencies such as the Kempeitai, but what has been decided so far is still to indict individual personnel, not the entire organization. Personnel of the Japanese Kempeitai are currently being indicted by Mr. Karpentor, Director of the Legal Section of General MacArthur's Headquarters.</p>
<h3>Four Foreign Ministers Conference</h3>
<p>Discussing the handling of the Trieste issue</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Paris, 1st (Radio): The four foreign ministers held a meeting this afternoon to discuss how to handle the issue of the status of Trieste, the last item on the agenda of the committee on Italian political and territorial issues.</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch] London, 1st (Radio): Various committees of the peace conference are stepping up their work, intending to complete it before October 5th. When the committee on Balkan political and territorial issues met today, it voted on the issue of amending the Greek-Albanian border. The result was that the majority opposed the amendment, with only Greece supporting it, and the Netherlands and South Africa abstaining.</p>
<h3>Eisenhower on International Cooperation</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Berlin, 30th] US Army Chief of Staff General Eisenhower told reporters here today: "Every intelligent person knows that the world can no longer endure another world war, and human civilization can no longer suffer the scourge of war. I personally think that we have made some progress in avoiding war. Some people in the United States have a neurotic pessimism, which is not the case. We must never be discouraged. International cooperation is not impossible. We should continue to cooperate to produce good results, such as the Allied Control Council in Berlin, which is an agency that carries out its tasks in good faith. Anglo-American economic cooperation in Germany is also a good example."</p>
<h3>The United States is Watching Turkish-Soviet Relations</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] San Francisco, 1st (Radio): Government officials said that regarding the recent note sent by the Soviet Union to Turkey regarding the Dardanelles Strait, the Turkish government has consulted the British and American governments for their opinions and decided on a response. It is said that the US response will be issued within a week. Prior consultation with the army and navy authorities is required. People do not need to panic excessively, but the tense situation is a fact. The Soviet note requested participation in the management of the straits. Various signs in Washington indicate that Britain and the United States will advise Turkey to reject this request.</p>
<h3>World Bank Loans: Countries Can Apply</h3>
<p>Stable Exchange Rates Will Be Discussed at a Meeting</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch] London, 1st (Radio): World Bank President Meyer said that this world financial institution, which has a capital of 9 billion US dollars, will soon begin lending to countries damaged by the war, but so far, no formal loan applications have been received. France, Poland, and Czechoslovakia have made informal requests for loans, totaling 500 million yuan for France, 600 million yuan for Poland, and 350 million yuan for Czechoslovakia. In his first annual report, Meyer said that he intends to ask Congress to allow US savings banks and insurance companies to invest in the World Bank. Meyer also said that an international monetary conference will be held in October to discuss stable exchange rates.</p>
<h3>China Has Fully Paid the United Nations Fund</h3>
<p>[United Press, New York, 30th] The United Nations announced today that China has paid the last installment of its total advance payment to the United Nations headquarters fund, totaling 600,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>President Truman Elaborates on Pacific Base Policy; U.S. Navy Secretary Discusses Mediterranean Fleet Mission</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 30th] President Truman held a special press conference today to explain the United States' policy regarding existing bases in the Pacific, with Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Towers also in attendance. According to the plan announced by the President, Guam and Saipan will remain the heart of the U.S. defense network in the Western Pacific. Secondary bases will be established on the islands of Okinawa, Truk, Espiritu Santo, and Kwajalein. A decision has not yet been made regarding which base the United States will utilize in the Philippines. In New Guinea, the U.S. plans to abandon part of the Manus Island base in Australia. In the North Pacific, a consolidated base is being established near Kodiak Island in Alaska for use by the U.S. Navy and Marine Corps.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 30th] Secretary of the Navy Forrestal recently gave a speech here explaining the mission of the U.S. Navy in the Mediterranean. He stated: Since the early 19th century, the United States has regularly maintained a fleet in European waters, especially the Mediterranean. In the years following the end of World War I, when the situation was still unstable, the U.S. Mediterranean Fleet made significant contributions to establishing peace in the Balkans and the Middle East. Today, the U.S. Navy continues to be stationed in the Eastern Atlantic and the Mediterranean, for two purposes: (1) to supply the Allied occupation forces in the occupied territories of Europe and to assist the Allied military governments in fulfilling their missions; and (2) to protect American interests and support American policies. At the same time, the presence of the U.S. Navy in these regions has the following benefits: (1) U.S. naval officers and sailors can gain excellent training opportunities and become familiar with the waters they patrol and the traditions and customs of the countries they visit. (2) Boosting naval morale, as many officers and sailors still "broaden their horizons" as a reason for joining the Navy. (3) U.S. Navy personnel can have the opportunity to practice goodwill and understanding with the people they encounter.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 30th] President Truman today received a detailed report on U.S. naval military operations in the Pacific and immediately met with Secretary of the Navy Forrestal and Commander-in-Chief of the Pacific Theater Nimitz. Towers told reporters that the Navy has reduced the number of bases it originally planned to retain after the war due to budget cuts.</p>
<h3>Japan's Three Major Zaibatsu Companies Officially Announce Dissolution Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Remodeling Society, Tokyo, 1st] Japan's three Zaibatsu companies, Mitsui, Mitsubishi, and Yasuda, held shareholder meetings yesterday under supervision and officially announced their dissolution. These three companies have become liquidating corporations. The three companies have already paid up capital of 1.097 billion yen, and all securities are scheduled to be transferred to the Adjustment Committee in the near future. In addition, Sumitomo and Fuji Industries companies will require more time to reorganize internally, and dissolution is expected to take place next spring.</p>
<h3>Fierce Fighting Underway Along the Persian Gulf Coast</h3>
<p>[United Press, Tehran, 30th] Iranian government forces are engaged in fierce fighting with Southern tribal rebels along a 100-mile stretch of the Persian Gulf coast. The rebels have occupied half of the port of Bushehr, and the defending forces are engaged in street fighting with them. The tribal forces are advancing northwest from Bushehr to Bandar-e Mahshahr, 140 miles away.</p>
<h3>British Troops Withdraw Completely from Lebanon</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Cairo, 30th] The last batch of British troops stationed in Lebanon left today, heading to Egypt via Palestine.</p>
<h3>Uproar in the Far East Tribunal: French Prosecutor Insists on Speaking in French, Court President Angered by Violation of Rules</h3>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 1st] After a full day of debate, the Far East International Tribunal today decided to allow French Prosecutor Oneto to speak in his native language, but Oneto threatened to resign unless he apologized to the court. Oneto claimed that he represented the great nation of France, and if he was not allowed to speak in French, he would have to withdraw from the case. Webb, hearing this, became furious and said that he hoped to hear Oneto's apology when the court reconvened in the afternoon. The prosecutors then requested an adjournment until the next morning so that Oneto could have ample time to consider whether to apologize to the court or withdraw. Webb had told Oneto that the court's regulations stipulated that only English or Japanese could be used. Defense attorney Levin said that the court rules specifically stated that only English and Japanese could be used, and the court had no power to amend the rules, but the court finally allowed the use of French, meaning that Soviet prosecutors could also use Russian in the future.</p>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 1st] When the Far East International Tribunal convened today, Prosecutor Keenan requested the court to also use French, arguing for two hours, and the court adjourned at noon without a decision. Presiding Judge Webb said that the core issue was whether the court had the power to adopt a third or fourth language, as the court rules limited testimony to English and Japanese.</p>
<h3>France in Revival (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent of This Newspaper, Song Yu</p>
<p>[Correspondence from Paris, September 15th] A friend who has lived in Paris for a while took me to a restaurant. Over a 100-centimeter baguette, we inadvertently argued with a waiter. According to French regulations, each person's ration per meal is a 100-centimeter baguette, but this friend was naturally blessed with an appetite that exceeded that of others, and 200 centimeters were not enough to satisfy him. Because the waiter refused to give him more, this friend became angry and said, "How many French people gorge themselves in China, and we haven't argued, why are you stingy with these few Chinese?" Unexpectedly, these words won the sympathy of many French people sitting nearby, who all chimed in and asked about the current situation in China. Someone asked, "Is there no problem with food in China now?" This friend said more confidently, "No problem, as long as you have money." The French seemed not to quite believe it and turned to solicit my opinion, asking,</p>
<p>"Is it really okay as long as you have money?" I also smiled wryly and said, "With money, anything is possible." Generally speaking, although the situation in France today is not like that in China, where people are starving to death on the one hand, while restaurants and singing halls are still full of delicacies, it is also not as strictly restricted as in England, where the menu always has the same few items and the prices are always the same, where the rich have no place to spend their money and the poor don't have to worry about starving to death. France seems to be somewhere in between, where the poor are slightly worse off, and the rich have their own ample space to wield the power of their wealth, but not without limits. Those of us who have come here from England are already complacent and don't want to return, so naturally we don't dare to be too demanding. We carefully observe from an objective standpoint and cannot help but admire the speed of their recovery. Both England and France are almost back to their pre-war state. The difference is that</p>
<p>English goods emphasize foreign trade, and the best products are sold abroad to compete for the market, and only cheap and necessary items are allowed to be sold domestically. Therefore, there are no luxury goods to be seen in the English market to this day, but if you read the monthly report of the Board of Trade, you will know that England's export trade has long exceeded the previous numbers, and is now continuing to increase, which shows the speed of the recovery of British industry. On the contrary, although French industry and commerce are also recovering rapidly and exports are also increasing monthly, it is still difficult to compare with England and the United States due to various factors. Moreover, France's policy is not as combative as that of England. The products of factories, whether luxury goods or practical goods, can be sold equally at home and abroad. The glass windows are full of novel products, dazzling the eye, especially for the average visitor from London, who seems to have entered a fairyland. In fact, people around the world who like to buy beautiful clothes are gradually turning their eyes to Paris again. During my stay in Paris, Paris opened a</p>
<p>fashion exhibition, to advertise for major shops, which caused a sensation in Europe. The European edition of the New York Herald Tribune used a large headline, saying that French fashion was once again leading the world, and that fashion lovers around the world would once again take the new styles of Paris as the standard of popularity. Therefore, the fairyland of human enjoyment in the future may again be counted as Paris. Once, a reporter met a young American girl who had just arrived in Paris and asked him what he thought of Paris. He said, "It's great, whatever you want, there is." I asked him how it was compared to the United States, she thought for a moment and said, "Except that there is not enough milk, I don't feel any inconvenience." This is the situation in Paris today. However, it must be added here that today</p>
<p>Paris has a lot of supplies, and although luxury goods are abundant, nineteen are French products, and there are very few imported goods. For example, Swiss watches are famous all over the world, and Americans who go to mainland Europe, no one does not buy a few Swiss watches back, but France, which is close to the water, does not easily get Swiss watches, and there are many clocks and watches on the market, all of which are French products, and very few are imported from Switzerland. From this, it can also prove the speed of the French industrial revival</p>

<h3>City Council and Fourteen Other Groups Jointly Host U.S. Military Dependents; Grand Garden Party Held at Lido Garden Yesterday; Speaker Pan Delivered a Speech on Behalf of All Sectors to Welcome Them</h3>
<p>The Shanghai City Council, the Shanghai Local Association, the Shanghai Press Association, the City Education Association, the City Lawyers Association, the City Chamber of Commerce, the City Bankers Association, the City Industrial Association, the City Federation of Trade Unions, the City Money Trade Association, the City Daily Press Association, the City Accountants Association, the City Farmers Association, and the Sixth District Cotton Textile Industry Association of Shanghai, etc. held a garden party yesterday afternoon at the Lido Garden to host the U.S. military dependents who recently came to Shanghai. The party began at 4 o'clock. Mayor Wu and his wife arrived early to fulfill the hospitality of the host. Guests then arrived in pairs, totaling more than 200 people, mingling and chatting, and the atmosphere was extremely warm and harmonious, truly a grand event.</p>
<p>Then, Speaker Pan Gongzhan delivered a welcoming speech on behalf of all sectors, which stated: Today, the Shanghai City Council, the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, the Shanghai Federation of Trade Unions, the Shanghai Education Association, the Shanghai Daily Press Association, the Shanghai Local Association, the Shanghai Farmers Association, the Shanghai Industrial Association, the Shanghai Bankers Association, the Shanghai Money Trade Association, the Shanghai Lawyers Association, the Shanghai Accountants Association, the Shanghai Press Association, and the Sixth District Cotton Textile Industry Association, and other fourteen groups, are meeting at the Lido Garden, representing the four million citizens of Shanghai, to welcome the families of the American soldiers stationed in China, I am very honored to have the opportunity to briefly speak on behalf of these groups. The United States and China are allied nations on both sides of the Pacific Ocean. They fought shoulder-to-shoulder during the war and are working together to maintain peace after the war. We are very grateful for American aid to China during the war, and we are especially grateful for the American military's stay in China after the war to help us repatriate Japanese prisoners and residents and to promote peace and unity in China. Because we firmly believe that the mission of the American military's temporary stay in China is to assist China's post-war recovery, so that China, which has fought hard for eight years, can embark on the path of unity, peace, and strength as soon as possible, so as to fulfill its obligations as a member of the United Nations to maintain world peace together, and that the United States has no selfish intentions whatsoever. After defeating Japan, American soldiers could have returned to their country and enjoyed their family life as soon as possible, but they stayed in China to assist at China's request, which caused a delay in their repatriation. It is a pity, and now that your families have come to China one after another, you can share your longing after a long separation with you, and this is not only to congratulate you on your family reunion in China, but also to give the Eastern civilization represented by Chinese cultural relics and customs the opportunity to connect with the distinguished guests who have come to China for the first time, so that American allies can increase their understanding of China, which will undoubtedly benefit the cooperation between the two major allies in the future. Shanghai is an international city with a hundred years of history. It is the gateway to China, and we Chinese have always valued hospitality to distinguished guests. Therefore, whether you stay in Shanghai for a long time or a short time, we all hope that we can contribute to your stay so that you can have the pleasure of "feeling at home." Today's garden party is just one aspect of this. What I want to tell you more clearly is that the United States is truly a good friend of China, and whether it is Britain, the Soviet Union, France, or other united countries, all are good friends of China. "All under heaven are one family" and "the world is one community" have always been the ideals of Chinese sages, and also the purpose of Dr. Sun Yat-sen, the father of the nation, in advocating revolution. Now, taking advantage of the opportunity to welcome good friends, we will share our sincerity of "being kind to our neighbors" and "emphasizing trustworthiness" with the people of the world. Today, the hospitality is inadequate and the wording is simple, please forgive us and give us more advice. After the speech, enthusiastic applause was given all around. Then, Ms. Wang Xiaogu gave a brief speech: In the past, she had participated in many grand receptions for the Allied forces in the inland, but there were only Allied soldiers without their families. Today, she is very happy to be able to gather with the American soldiers and their families. Then, the grand entertainment program began, and the Chinese martial arts performance was the most popular with the guests, which greatly gained the guests' interest. The party ended in joy at about 6 o'clock.</p>

<h3>Zhong He's Integrity is Commendable for Refusing Gifts from Vendors</h3>
<p>Zhong He, the section chief of the first section of the Xujiahui Branch of the Police Bureau, was ordered to enforce the crackdown on street vendors diligently. On the 18th of last month, vendor representatives He Zhu'ao and Zhu Yunzhang came to petition, requesting the General Bureau to approve an extension of half a month to show consideration. On the morning of the 22nd, at 10:00 AM, He and Zhu suddenly visited Section Chief Zhong at his residence and presented him with a sealed envelope containing a 400,000 yuan check from the Guohua Bank. Section Chief Zhong immediately stated solemnly that public officials should be honest and abide by the law and must not accept any gifts from the people, and asked them to take it back immediately, but the two representatives He and Zhu insisted that this was out of their own volition and did not want to take the group. Section Chief Zhong then reported the information to Chief Bai of the branch, who reported to the General Bureau that the section chief was diligent, cautious, and honest, and should be commended. It is heard that the General Bureau believes that the section chief's integrity is a model for police officers and, in addition to ordering that the 400,000 yuan check be handed over to the Xujiahui Branch for immediate return, will also give him an award.</p>

The original full-route fare was 500 yuan, which has been reduced to 300 yuan starting yesterday.

Now, to reduce the burden on passengers, it has been decided to reduce it ahead of schedule.</p>
<h3>Judge in Embezzlement Case at the Railway Bureau's Materials Department Ill; No Further Hearing Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper] The embezzlement case at the Railway Bureau's Materials Department was originally scheduled to continue hearing in the First Criminal Court of the District Court yesterday morning, but because the judge in charge of the case, Mei Erhe, was ill and requested leave, the case was adjourned for trial. The thirty-six defendants in the case and the thirty lawyers hired by them all appeared in court yesterday to prepare their defenses. Twenty reporters from various newspapers and many Railway Bureau employees and relatives and friends of the defendants also attended the hearing. Thirteen Railway Bureau employees among the defendants who were in custody were brought from the Masnan Road Detention Center, while two of the five who were released on bail were absent. All eighteen merchant defendants reported for questioning.

He then adjourned the court at 9:50 AM, a total of only five minutes.</p>
<h3>A Wide Array of Samples: A Grand Sight - Export Goods Exhibition Officially Opened Yesterday - Venue Set at the YMCA, Grand in Scale, Profound Significance Under Shrinking Exports</h3>
<p>[Special Report from Our Newspaper] The China Export Goods Exhibition, meticulously prepared for three months, finally had its official opening yesterday at 2:00 PM at the Eight Immortals Bridge YMCA! As the reporter stepped out of the stuffy train car, the first thing that caught the eye was a large red and white cloth banner surrounding the giant gate of the YMCA, adorned with the large characters "China Export Goods Exhibition," giving one a sense that this would be no ordinary exhibition. Indeed, in the current state of import dumping and shrinking exports, this exhibition holds special significance.</p>
<p>Complete Collection of Tung Oil Specimens</p>
<p>When the reporter arrived at the YMCA, the first venue on the ground floor was not yet fully arranged, so I had to start from the sixth venue on the third floor, looking at them in reverse order. The entire sixth venue was set up and exhibited by the China Vegetable Oil Factory alone. Here, various kinds of vegetable oil seeds were collected, among which the most noteworthy was tung oil, a specialty of our country. Almost all kinds of specimens, from tung seeds, tung leaves, to tung trunks, were collected. There was even a *xieju* tree planted here. From the charts on the wall, one could see the important position of China's tung oil in international trade. A diagram of the tung oil pressing process with a blue background and white drawings allowed visitors to understand the entire pressing process at a glance! The fifth venue displayed enamelware and porcelain. It is said that enamelware sold well in various parts of Southeast Asia before the war, but now it still needs to be developed. The porcelain section mostly featured small and exquisite figurines of people and horses, and a few porcelain pots were particularly exquisite!</p>
<p>Furs and Carpets Attract Attention</p>
<p>The second, third, and fourth venues were all on the second floor. They were much larger in scale than the fifth and sixth venues! In the fourth venue, the bone buttons, furs, and carpets on display were all eye-catching items. The fur section collected various animal skins. A golden leopard skin coat was hung in the center, priced at a staggering two and a half million yuan. Whether this price is suitable for export is questionable. The carpet section displayed knitted wool carpets produced by Hengfengyong Factory. It is said that the United States is the largest importer of carpets. After the recent exchange rate adjustment, carpet exports have become more active. For example, the factory has recently sold an average of 10,000 square feet per month. The third venue displayed various knitted goods such as fancy socks and handkerchiefs. There were also various drawn thread works known for their exquisite craftsmanship, and dazzling five-colored duck down quilts. The Meiya Silk Weaving Factory also displayed various silk products here.</p>
<p>Seeking Compensation for Wartime Silk Losses from Japan</p>
<p>The second venue featured exhibits of all kinds of silk fabrics from the China Silk Company, D誠 Silk Factory, and the Electrical Silk Weaving Association. It is said that the China Silk Company spent a total of ten million yuan on installing tree windows and displays. Among them, a large pattern made of white silk braids nailed onto a red and blue silk background was particularly alarming. According to the data revealed above, the relationship between China's silk industry and export trade, from 1927 to 1936, the average annual export value was 1,067,609,000 yuan, and the average annual export value was 156,858,000 yuan. The silk export value accounted for 14.69% of the total export value. From January to July of this year, the total export value was 96,364,791,000 yuan, and the silk export value was 16,659,271,690 yuan. The silk export value accounted for 17% of the total export value. On the other hand, it also revealed that the total loss of China's wartime silk industry was 2,003,000 metric tons of silk production, and the total loss of silk machinery was 300 million yuan (pre-war currency value). The total number of mulberry trees lost was 2 million. All of these are to be compensated for by Japan!</p>
<p>High Expectations for Foreign Merchants' Visits</p>
<p>The first venue was on the lowest floor, the largest in scale, and had the most units. Sewing needles and sewing machine needles from the Da Zhong Industrial Factory, records; Shaoxing wine from the Kailin Canned Food Factory; glassware from the Xinhua Glass Factory; hot water bottles from the China Xingye, Yi Chang, and Dan Ye Factories; and medicines from Xinya, Xinyi, Wuzhou, Sino-French, and Foci, all had their own characteristics. In addition, China's specialty pig bristles and peppermint were also on display here with complete samples.</p>
<p>It is said that on the first day of the exhibition yesterday, quite a few foreign merchants visited. This shows what kind of expectations foreign merchants have for China's export products. It is hoped that all export manufacturers can find ways to improve quality and strive to reduce costs, which are prerequisites for promoting exports! At the same time, the general public may wish to take the opportunity of the exhibition to broaden their knowledge. The exhibition time is from yesterday to the 6th, from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM and from 2:00 PM to 6:00 PM every day. Admission is completely free.</p>
<h3>Puppet Municipal Government Stealing and Selling Real Estate - More Than Eight-tenths of a Plot Found</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Many public properties of the former French Concession were concealed and stolen by the French Municipal Council, and some were also sold by the puppet municipal government. According to sources, there is a small plot of vacant land near the Huangpu Branch, measuring 0.824 *li*. On July 12, 1932, it was sold to Wu Delin by the puppet municipal government. According to authorities in the French Concession, this transaction is invalid.</p>
<p>The former Joint Public Property Handling Committee of the Two Concessions, by order of the Executive Yuan, should invite relevant countries to send advisors to discuss the matter together. Where there is profit, there will be much debate, so this issue is becoming more and more complicated and may not be resolved in the short term.</p>
<h3>Central Trust Bureau Holds Bureau Affairs Meeting</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning at 10:00 AM, the Central Trust Bureau held its first bureau affairs meeting after the victory. Chairman Bei Zuyi delivered a speech, stating that the business of the Central Trust Bureau is to promote the government's current national policies and serve society, and it cannot be compared with ordinary trust institutions. Director Liu Gongyun reported that the bureau opened on October 1, 1935, and it has been exactly eleven years since then. Recalling eleven years ago, only two years after the establishment of the Shanghai Head Office, the Sino-Japanese War broke out. In the past eight years, it has been developing its business in the interior. Currently, there are 17 branches and 15 offices, which shows the wide range of its business. The focus of this meeting is to seek to improve bureau affairs, promote business, and make the agencies of various branches closely linked. It is also learned that the bureau has successively received more than 160 proposals from various branches on improving business. It has been decided to first form a small group meeting to review the proposals, provide opinions, and then submit them to the general meeting for public decision. The above small group meetings are divided into seven groups, including insurance, real estate, trust, and savings. Yesterday afternoon from 3:00 PM to 6:00 PM, the insurance small group meeting was held first.</p>
<h3>Resolution of Labor-Management Disputes in the Commercial Press</h3>
<p>The labor-management dispute in the Commercial Press was resolved yesterday afternoon after the Mediation Section of the Social Affairs Bureau convened labor and management for the fifth time. As a result, labor and management cooperated in a spirit of mutual understanding until 6:00 PM, and a mediation was finally reached.</p>
<h3>New Director of the US Information Service, Cordier, Arrives in Shanghai to Take Over</h3>
<p>The new acting director of the US Information Service in China, Cordier, recently arrived in Shanghai from the United States to take office, replacing the former director, Fairbank. At the same time, he will also act as executive director. The executive director, Connors, who was originally responsible for Shanghai, has been transferred to Nanjing to work. Mr. Cordier was born in Fujian Province, China, and speaks fluent Min dialect. He is very familiar with the situation in China. He is very willing to have more contact with Chinese culture and press people during his visit to Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Two People Meet on a Narrow Road and Accuse Each Other of Being Traitors</h3>
<p>Yang Yingsheng, from Anhui Province, lives at No. 190, North Xizang Road. When he was walking on Xizang Road yesterday morning, he met Li Dasan (38 years old, from Anhui Province). During the period of the enemy puppet regime, Li Dasan served as the head of the Construction Section of the Dangtu County Government in Anhui Province. Yang Yingsheng was also working underground in Dangtu County at the time. He was arrested by the enemy police in Wuhu, so he knew Li Dasan. Yang immediately stepped forward, grabbed Li, and took him directly to the Taishan Police Station under its jurisdiction to report the information. Li Dasan admitted that he had served as the puppet section chief, but said that Yang Yingsheng was also working as a special agent for the Dangtu puppet county government at the time. The police station then submitted a document to the High Procuratorate for trial.</p>
<h3>A Casual Discussion of Press Conferences: Some Are Fierce, Some Are Cunning, Some Are Smooth, Some Are Tricky, Some Are Harsh, Some Are Humorous, Sometimes They Can Be Like a Good Show, Sometimes Like Being Hypnotized</h3>
<p>[Special Report from Our Newspaper] "Yesterday at × o'clock, ××× hosted a press conference for reporters from various newspapers in the city..."</p>
<p>News that begins like this has appeared on the newspapers almost every day recently. Readers of newspapers are probably all familiar with the term "press conference."</p>
<p>However, from the perspective of the reporters who are "invited," the "flavor" of these many press conferences is different: attending a good press conference is simply like watching a good show (of course, sometimes it's not just "watching," but also "acting" oneself), with verbal swords and guns, which is very enjoyable; but if you encounter a bad press conference, it is really extremely painful and unbearable.</p>
<p>The first thing about a "good" press conference is that it starts on time, and the second is that the host really has something to say and can say it clearly. Most press conferences of political parties meet the above two conditions. A good spokesperson can make you admire his "clear and logical" skills even if you disagree with his views; no matter how fierce you ask, he always answers smoothly; if you ask fiercely, he answers cleverly; if you ask harshly, he answers humorously.</p>
<p>Zhang Junmai's Witty Reply</p>
<p>I think that the press conference when the Democratic Socialist Party was established was very successful. First, Mr. Zhang Junmai is a scholar, sincere and dignified, and his words are truthful, which naturally makes people convinced. Second, his assistants were very good, circling around and accurately grasping the reactions of the reporters. It just so happened that a reporter who liked to speak was a little lacking in tact and asked a naive question, so one of the spokespersons replied wittily, and the result was that all the reporters laughed and stood up to leave. Do you want to know how he asked?</p>
<p>"Excuse me, Mr. Zhang Junmai: it seems that in the minds of most Chinese people now, there are only two parties, one is the Kuomintang and the other is the Communist Party. May I ask, in terms of ideology, does the Democratic Socialist Party lean towards the Kuomintang or the Communist Party?"</p>
<p>At that time, a reporter sitting opposite me wrote four large characters for me to see: "Looking for trouble!"</p>
<p>Sure enough, Mr. Zhang Junmai replied with both anger and amusement: "How many people are there in the Kuomintang? Let's say 100 million. How many people are there in the Communist Party? Let's say 50 million. Then among the 450 million Chinese people, there are still many left, and the scope of activities of other parties is very large - very large!"</p>
<p>As a result, everyone burst into laughter.</p>
<p>Wedemeyer's Clever Evasion</p>
<p>Many dignitaries often have witty remarks when evading reporters' questions at press conferences. Not long after Marshall came to China, he summoned Wedemeyer, who had not yet left China at that time, and had a secret talk for a long time. At Wedemeyer's press conference, a reporter went straight to the point and asked, "General Wedemeyer, can you tell us what Marshall and you talked about?"</p>
<p>This question was what all the reporters wanted to ask, but everyone also knew that Wedemeyer probably didn't want to answer this question very much. As a result, the atmosphere immediately became tense, and everyone watched how he would answer.</p>
<p>Who knew that Wedemeyer touched his silver hair and said, "Forgot."</p>
<p>The method used by the new director of the UNRRA office in China, Eggerton, to avoid reporters' questions was also very interesting. He first gave a rambling speech about his impressions and hopes on taking office. As soon as he finished speaking, he asked, "Any questions?"</p>
<p>A Ten-Minute Press Conference</p>
<p>In fact, at that time, the reporters had countless questions in their minds about the UNRRA suspension order. Unexpectedly, General Eggerton waited for at most two seconds. The reporters had not yet figured out how to phrase their questions, but he had already said, "Thank you all for attending, we'll talk later." This press conference ended before the reporters could even ask questions. I remember that this meeting lasted for a total of probably less than ten minutes.</p>
<p>The longest press conferences were those of the former United Association of Factories Moving to Sichuan and Guangxi, which often lasted for seven or eight speeches, three or four hours. Indeed, the experiences of the industrialists who moved inland were worthy of everyone's sympathy, but if they could often publish their opinions in writing, at least at the press conference, they would not make the host and reporters exhausted; and the reporters would not have to painstakingly delete and abandon many good materials when writing their稿s at home.</p>
<p>A Smoky and Dirty Dining Hall</p>
<p>Here, I would like to mention those unpleasant press conferences. After the heads of the various branch offices of the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration came to Shanghai, the translation office of the office often held press conferences. The intention was certainly good, but the place where these press conferences were held was often the dining hall of the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration. Because it was next to the kitchen, the cooking smoke often made the world change color. Often, the place where the uncrowned emperors are entertained becomes a smoky and dirty place. As for whether there is still grease under the white tablecloth, although I dare not say, the air is indeed filled with sweet, salty, and even greasy ingredients.</p>
<p>Also, General Chennault's press conferences were often a bit scary. Because this man heard too many airplane sounds, he was a bit deaf in both ears. Sometimes, even if you try your best to "yell" the question, he still doesn't hear it; and it is even more common for him to answer irrelevantly.</p>
<p>The Most Terrible Time</p>
<p>However, the most terrible press conference was the report of the ×× Bureau held in the New Life Club on the eve of Journalists' Day. It was really a case where none of the three elements of timing, location, and people were favorable. Speaking of "timing," Ambassador Stuart happened to be in Shanghai that day, and everyone was very busy, and many people had other appointments at 6:00 PM. Unexpectedly, Director × of the Bureau was first an hour late, and then talked endlessly - but in fact, he already had a detailed written report. Speaking of "location," someone happened to be holding a wedding at the New Life Club that day, and it was only a wall away from the place where the press conference was held. Inside, the report was being given happily, while outside, the band was playing enthusiastically. As a result, the reporters laughed at the director - if they didn't laugh like this, his report might have ended even later. As for "people," I think I'll be kind and not say it. But I might as well mention it in general: when dealing with journalists, "sincerity" is better than "smoothness" after all. The worst is a really sincere honest person who insists on learning to be smooth - and the result is what Shanghainese call a "tofu target," or in English, a Bore.</p>

<h3>Difficulty in Handling Illegal Assets - A Small Amount of Living Expenses for Family Members to Be Discussed - Many Houses Are Occupied and Few People Buy Them</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The biggest difficulty for the Illegal Assets Handling Group of the Enemy and Puppet Property Handling Bureau in handling illegal assets is that the Ministry of Justice has not yet responded to the method of retaining living expenses for family members from confiscated illegal assets. At the same time, handling illegal assets takes a long time. It is necessary to wait until the person who has been judged to be an illegal person no longer appeals, or the appeal has been rejected, before the court sends the judgment to the Illegal Assets Handling Committee for execution. Currently, the properties of Chen Gongbo, Miao Bin, Chu Minyi, Yang Jie, and Mei Siping are being processed. The method of handling is to put the confiscated illegal assets up for sale on the one hand, and to investigate whether there is any concealment on the other hand, and to reward those who secretly report it. On the other hand, the situation of the family members of each illegal person is being investigated. However, bidding is also very difficult, because most of the houses are occupied and few people buy them. Regarding the assets of each illegal person, they are entrusted to the Handling Bureau by the judicial organs for safekeeping. After the Handling Bureau seals them up, they are entrusted to the Central Trust Bureau for safekeeping, and the Trust Bureau entrusts the current occupants for safekeeping. The furniture and other items in the illegal assets are all registered and verified by the Trust Bureau, and the current occupants are responsible for safekeeping.</p>
<p>It is also learned that when the Illegal Assets Handling Committee meets this Friday afternoon, it may discuss the issue of retaining living expenses for family members from confiscated illegal assets. Because the amount of illegal assets varies greatly. If a certain amount of living expenses is stipulated, the total value of some illegal assets may not even be enough to cover this amount. If a percentage is stipulated, then one-thousandth of some illegal assets would be enough for their family members to live a luxurious life. Therefore, this problem is very difficult to solve.</p>
<h3>Broadway Mansion Not for Sale - To Be Used as the Shanghai Site of the Lizi Society</h3>
<p>It was previously proposed to sell the Broadway Mansion on the north side of the Waibaidu Bridge. According to the person in charge of handling enemy and puppet assets, the proposal to sell the mansion has been decided to be cancelled. It will be taken over by the Ministry of National Defense and used as the Shanghai site of the Lizi Society to entertain family members of military and political dignitaries and foreign guests. Currently, the mansion is managed and used by the US military, and the Central Trust Bureau Real Estate Office collects the rent for the shops on the ground floor on a monthly basis. It is said that the mansion will be taken over by the Lizi Society in the near future.</p>
<h3>China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Jiangjing Wheel Will Join the Shanghai-Ningbo Line</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The Shanghai-Ningbo money ferry has been the first to resume sailing after the victory. It has been smooth and unimpeded for more than a year. The original four wheels, Jiangya, Dahua, Chuanshan, and Jiangsu, operate, with ships traveling back and forth every day. In order to enrich the Shanghai-Ningbo line, China Merchants Steam Navigation Company has now dispatched the Jiangjing Wheel to participate in the sailing. The wheel is slightly larger than the Jiangya Wheel, with a total of more than 3,700 tons. It has been painted at the Rui Rong Factory for more than a month and is brand new. It will set sail immediately. After the Jiangjing Wheel starts running, the Jiangya Wheel will depart from Shanghai on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, and the Jiangjing Wheel will depart from Shanghai on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays. Except for Sundays, the bureau has ships traveling back and forth every day.</p>
<h3>There Are Still Many Mad Dog Bites - The Police Station Intensifies the Killing</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Recently, many citizens in various districts of the city have been bitten by dogs. If they are not sent to the hospital immediately, the consequences will be dire. Moreover, the transmission is extremely rapid, and the victims often neglect minor injuries, which is very dangerous. The city authorities have issued a detailed statement that if there are cases of dogs biting people, the dog owner and the person who was bitten or their family members should immediately report to the nearby police station and get vaccinated at a specialized hospital. The dog should be captured and sent to the Mad Dog Inspection Institute at No. 10 Shajing Road Municipal Slaughterhouse for inspection. If it is healthy, it will be returned; otherwise, it will be captured and killed. In addition, the police station is now adding manpower and intensifying the killing of stray dogs.</p>
<p>[Another Report] The Health Bureau issued a public announcement yesterday that the number of citizens who developed major infectious diseases in September was 43 with dysentery, 65 with typhoid fever, and 127 with cholera, with 13 deaths. In addition, the Epidemic Prevention Committee is scheduled to hold a general meeting next week to conduct a general review of the epidemic prevention work this year and discuss the various important matters that the bureau should handle after the autumn.</p>
<h3>A Man Commits Suicide by Hanging at Jiaotong University</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] A man who committed suicide by hanging was suddenly found at Jiaotong University in Xujiahui yesterday morning. It was rumored that he was a student of the school. According to the police investigation, the deceased was named Sun Qinhe, 30 years old, from Shaoxing. He came to Shanghai from his hometown on the 28th of last month and went to Professor Zhang Yousheng of the school, begging for a job but failing. He temporarily resided in the school building. Due to economic pressure, he committed suicide. The court has been notified for inspection.</p>
<h3>Australian Envoy to China Speaks on the Issue of Full Employment</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The Australian Envoy to China, Mr. Copland, gave a speech on the issue of democratic countries and full employment at the British Chamber of Commerce at 12:30 PM yesterday. He said that in the two world wars, the problem of unemployment had become an important issue in most democratic countries, and countries such as Britain, the United States, Canada, Norway, and the Netherlands were not immune. He then elaborated on the importance of employment in the economic position and said that Australia has always firmly believed in the importance of high employment as an important goal of international economic policy in various international conferences in the past four years. High employment also implies a greater amount of international trade. This is because all countries need a large amount of imports. He concluded by saying that the employment policy will not only have a significant impact on the material conditions of the people, but it is also a touchstone for whether democratic countries are sufficient to meet the reasonable expectations of free people.</p>
<h3>Soldier Run Over and Killed by Military Vehicle</h3>
<p>Ye Jiaxiang, a captain member of the Central Training Corps' Provisional Officer Corps in Shanghai, was accidentally run over and killed in front of the dormitory of the corps two days ago by Mu Sutai, a soldier from the 2nd Company of the 11th Independent Truck Battalion, who was driving a military truck with the number 41582. The officer corps has requested compensation from the garrison headquarters and is punishing the murderer.</p>
<h3>Revival of American Goods Stalls: City God Temple Transformed: Glass-Enclosed United Market Established; Prosperity of Creek Mouth Road Resurrected Today</h3>
<p>[Special Report from This Newspaper]! Wild grasses can never be burnt out; the spring breeze brings them to life again – although it is not springtime now, the American goods peddlers who were once severely suppressed have revived like wild grass under a spring breeze, driven by a strong desire to survive. Apart from those who continue to appear furtively in the streets and alleys in a "guerrilla" fashion, the only difference is that the "wild grass" has gained legal status and has been transplanted into a "bonsai in a greenhouse."</p>
<p>From the bustling Creek Mouth Road to the concrete organization of the World United Market, the vendors' resourcefulness is fully displayed. For the sake of livelihood, they are unwilling to give up this line of business. If the authorities suppressed them because they obstructed traffic, they are willing to find another suitable location to concentrate in one place; if they are a loophole for smuggling, they are willing to no longer accept smuggled goods; if they affect legitimate businesses, they are willing to issue invoices and pay business taxes. They offered these conditions, and after repeated requests, the municipal authorities finally agreed to resume business. Thus, with the help of Mr. Huang Jinrong, they rented the address of the City God Temple's Small World Amusement Park to establish the World United Market, which officially opened yesterday.</p>
<p>Walking through the festively decorated gate, ascending to the second floor, on both sides are portraits, one of the chairman and one of the late Premier, filled with congratulatory banners, and flower baskets covering the corners. Recalling the embarrassing situation of being suppressed a month ago, isn't life like a play? Going inside, what a lively scene! Uniform glass cabinets, every three forming a unit, each unit has a shop number and a sign, written on uniform rectangular glass suspended from the ceiling by ropes. All kinds of American goods are piled up and crammed into the glass cabinets, people squeeze around, and the prosperity of Creek Mouth Road has reappeared today. Prices are still relatively cheap: a bottle of 100 cod liver oil capsules costs only 3,500 yuan, and a large bottle of Gu Ling Yu can be bought for 1,500 yuan. One cabinet displays several shiny, red and green "glass ties"; asking the price, they are 8,000 yuan each. The clerk introduces with a boastful tone: "They cost more than 10,000 on Avenue Joffre!"</p>
<p>The entire market has 264 glass cabinets, in groups of three, for a total of 88 groups, all under the jurisdiction of the General Management Office. The organization of the General Management Office can be said to be "small but complete." Like a small agency, it is divided into five sections, with a section chief and staff in charge. Next to the staircase leading to the back door, the inspection section has dispatched two people to guard it all day long. All the goods brought in by each unit must pass through this inspection to verify the invoices to avoid the mixing in of smuggled goods; it seems that the management is quite strict.</p>
<p>Their business licenses are obtained by the General Management Office in the name of the United Market, and the Finance Bureau collected 75,000 yuan in license fees. All expenses are shared jointly. This time, the decoration costs for opening each group were about 500,000 yuan, and the monthly rent thereafter is 3 million yuan in total, with each glass cabinet only bearing more than 10,000 yuan, so their expenses are still more economical than those of formal stores. Moreover, having obtained legal status, they no longer need to provide illegal demands. The only drawback is that they are farther from the central district. It is said that in the near future, two similar markets, "Asia" and "Dragon Gate," will also appear on Avenue President Chiang Kai-shek. The two images above are the market gate and merchandise (taken by this newspaper).</p>

<h3>Son of Merchant Commits Fraud After Running Out of Money</h3>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper] Zhang Shunxiang (23 years old), son of Shanghai merchant Zhang Shangda of 25 Yuxing Lane, Avenue du Père Labouré, recently became inextricably linked with Yan Hua, a dancing girl at the Lido Dance Hall, and rented a large room at the Weida Hotel, causing financial strain. Therefore, he had to find other sources of income, and under the pretext of ordering jeeps, he successively defrauded his friends Cai Leiren, Mr. Chen, and several others of more than 3,000 US dollars, spending it extravagantly. After Cai and others urged him repeatedly, Zhang avoided seeing them. Cai and others then realized they had been deceived and reported to the police station, requesting an investigation.</p>
<h3>Eliminating Disasters: Important Anti-Theft Information</h3>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper] Recently, the trend of theft in this city has resurged. In addition to making efforts to prevent and arrest thieves, the police department has also formulated important anti-theft information, hoping that all citizens of the city will pay attention to it in order to eliminate disasters before they occur and reduce harm invisibly.</p>
<p>For Residents</p>
<p>(1) From sunset onwards, the front and back doors should be tightly closed to prevent unexpected events. (2) If someone knocks on the door, ask clearly who it is and never open the door easily, lest criminals take the opportunity to break in. (3) If there are several iron gates in each lane, one can be opened each night for entry and exit, to avoid increasing the criminals' activity routes. (4) If a peephole can be installed on the door, the knocker can be seen before the door is opened. It costs little and is very effective. (5) An electric bell can be installed in the indoor secretary's office to contact neighbors. In case of an accident, it can alert neighbors to report for assistance. (6) Be careful when hiring servants and ask for a guarantor. (7) Pay attention to the people who interact with the servants. (8) Pay attention to the neighbors in the same house and the people they interact with. (9) Do not expose wealth or valuables, lest they be coveted by criminals without knowing it. (10) Do not let children stray far from home, to avoid being noticed by criminals. (11) Usually pay attention to those who falsely claim to be visiting friends, delivering letters, or checking and repairing electricity, telephones, and tap water to enter the house without permission.</p>
<p>For Shops</p>
<p>(1) Alarm bells should be installed so that the police can be notified immediately in case of theft or robbery. (2) Employees should be carefully selected. (3) Be wary of the words and actions of customers to prevent accidents. (4) Handle incoming and outgoing cash properly and do not place it on the table to attract the attention of criminals. (5) An iron gate should be installed at the entrance and exit next to the counter to prevent outsiders from entering. (6) Pay attention to the people who interact with the shop assistants.</p>
<p>For Pedestrians</p>
<p>(1) Do not go out easily at night unless there are important events. (2) Do not walk on deserted roads or paths. (3) When taking a car, pay attention to the license plate number and the driver's appearance. (4) Pay attention to the objects you are carrying when getting on and off trams and buses. (5) When it is necessary to go out at night, avoid carrying valuables or ornaments.</p>
<p>For the General Public</p>
<p>(1) In the event of theft or robbery, try to remain calm and pay close attention to the thief's appearance, characteristics, clothing, accent, and the guns they are holding. (2) If you find that a thief has entered the house and there is still room to deal with it, you should try to sneak out and report to the police, or shout for help by the window. Also, if you can take the opportunity to turn off the main power switch and then report to the police, you can cause the thief to flee in a panic. (3) After a theft, do not touch the fingerprints left on the smooth furniture and utensils that the thief touched. If the thief fires a warning shot, pay attention to the location and look for bullet casings and bullets. (4) After being stolen, immediately go out and secretly follow the fleeing thief, and immediately report to the nearby police on duty. (5) After the thieves have escaped, immediately report to the police station to find a way to investigate and arrest them.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Ferry Company to Hold Inaugural Meeting This Month; Five-Year Plan Proposed to Increase Docks and Ferries; Prosper Pudong and Attract Residents to Move In</h3>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper] The Shanghai Ferry Company, jointly operated by the government and merchants, has been under preparation since May of this year. Due to currency fluctuations, the estimation of the total capital and the value of government shares has been affected several times, which has delayed the establishment. The initial capital was planned to be 1 billion yuan, then increased to 1.2 billion yuan, and most recently increased to 1.5 billion yuan, which has been submitted to the Municipal Council for discussion and approval. Among them, government shares account for one-third, totaling 500 million yuan in national currency, which is offset by all the remaining assets of the former ferry company received by the Public Utilities Bureau after the victory. The remaining 1 billion yuan will be raised by the Bank of Communications and ten other private banks, and it has now begun. According to Mr. Zhang Huikang, director of the company's preparatory office, the inaugural meeting can be held within this month.</p>
<p>Although the Municipal Ferry Company has not yet been formally established, in fact, all the work has been actively carried out by the preparatory office. In addition to restoring (1) the Changdu Songhu Line from Shanghai to Wusong, (2) the Dui Jiang Dongdong Line from Dongmen Road to Dongchang Road, and (3) the Dui Jiang Qichang Line from Qichangzhan to Qinhuangdao Road, the Dui Jiang Tangxun Line from Dongjiadu to Tangqiao has also resumed operation yesterday. The Dui Jiang Kaiding Line from Dinghai Bridge to Mudu Temple is expected to resume within this year. In addition, the company has also formulated a five-year plan to increase the construction of docks and ferries in stages for the purpose of prospering Pudong. The outline of the plan is as follows:</p>
<p>To be completed in 1947: (1) Increase the Dui Jiang ferry line at the South Wharf, (2) Kashi Over-River Line, from Lan Road to Yangjingbang. First build one ferry, and gradually add up to four. When there are four ferries, 3,000 trucks can be transported daily. (3) Test run the Dui Jiang Chunbei Line, from Beijing Road Wharf to Chunjiang Wharf. (4) Add Dui Jiang ferries.</p>
<p>To be completed in 1948: (1) Increase the Dui Jiang ferry line at Minsheng Road, (2) Changdu Nanhang Line, from Beijing Road Wharf to Longhua Port. (3) Improve the Dui Jiang Dudu Line. Chunbei Line, find a suitable location in Puxi, and plan to use the Japan-China Spinning Factory wharf in Pudong to build double-decker ferries to attract residents of Puxi to move to Pudong. If these double-decker ferries are increased to three, they can carry 100,000 passengers per day.</p>
<p>To be completed in 1949: (1) Increase the Dui Jiang ferry line at Zhoujiadu, (2) Increase the truck crossing line at the South Wharf, (3) Improve all long-distance Changdu lines, (4) Add large Changdu ferries.</p>
<p>To be completed in 1950: (1) Increase the Dui Jiang ferry line at Yangjiadu, (2) Continue to build large Changdu ferries, (3) Continue to improve the Dui Jiang Chunbei Line and Dongdong Line, (4) Add three double-decker Dui Jiang ferries, one of which will be used for the Dongdong Line and two for the Chunbei Line.</p>
<p>To be completed in 1951: (1) Increase the Dui Jiang ferry line at Yangjinggang, (2) Increase the truck crossing line at Dongmen Road.</p>
<p>Tangdong Line Resumes Operation Yesterday</p>
<p>[Another Report] The Pujiang Tangxun Line, which is a ferry line between Dongjiadu in Puxi and Tangqiao in Pudong, has a dense population on both sides and frequent travel. The preparatory office of the Municipal Ferry Company, which is in charge of Pujiang transportation, has been planning to restore it for a long time. The only reason is that the original Dongjiadu Wharf is close to the road, and there is no space in the middle, which is very inconvenient for passengers to get on and off. In addition, the siltation along the Pudong River is particularly serious, and the dredging project is too large. Therefore, the Gongyi Wharf has been re-surveyed as the special wharf for the Municipal Ferry and redesigned and built. It is now learned that since the active preparation of the line, all the projects have been completed. The area near the new wharf has also been entrusted to the Junpu Bureau to dredge it on its behalf. Therefore, from the first day of this month, ferries were assigned to officially resume operation. It is also heard that the Municipal Ferry authorities, in view of the fact that the line has always been an important route for Pudong vegetable vendors to cross the river, have specially advanced the daily sailing time as much as possible. The schedule stipulates that there will be one departure every 15 minutes from 3 a.m. to 8 p.m. According to reports, this line and the Dongdong Line are both important routes in the southern section of the Pujiang River. Once restored, it will be more convenient for citizens crossing the river to Pudong. In addition, the company's "Jiangsu" ferry was occupied by the enemy and severely damaged. It has now been repaired and will join the Beijing Road Bund and Wusong lines next week, with a speed of 11 nautical miles per hour.</p>
<h3>Reader Responses: Medicine and Health</h3>
<p>(1) Neurasthenia</p>
<p>Liu Li asks: I now have several medical questions, I pray for your answers: (1) If a young man suffers from spermatorrhea and kidney deficiency, is it reasonable to replenish the kidneys? (2) What are the tonic properties of hormones? Are they only for aphrodisiacs? Can young people use them? (3) Some people have preconceived notions and firmly believe that the ingredients of Vita-Spermin are all aphrodisiacs and can only be used by the elderly and not by the young. Is this statement accurate? (4) Young people who suffer from neurasthenia, kidney weakness, and physical weakness, are there any side-effect-free injections? Please advise me.</p>
<p>[Medical Doctor Yu Qi answers] (1) Only one case of spermatorrhea per month is not a disease. If it occurs frequently, it proves that the body is weak and the kidneys are deficient. You must take blood-tonifying and strengthening drugs, and multiple vitamin pills, etc. (2) Hormones are drugs that replenish internal secretions. Young people sometimes need to use them, which is determined by a doctor. (3) (4) You must take oral blood-tonifying and brain-tonifying medicine, and you can also inject blood-tonifying injections, etc.</p>

Thirty-odd injections of vitamin B1 were administered, but sometimes he developed chills and fever, which were also ineffective. In the spring of 1945, his left foot could move slightly, and by winter, his left hand could also be gradually lifted, but he still could not move freely. Who knew that in recent months, he suddenly showed a trembling state when walking, lasting for one minute. May I ask: (1) Is this symptom epilepsy? (2) What medicines can cure it? (3) If it is not treated, to what extent will the symptoms develop? (4) Can this symptom be expected to improve by adulthood?</p>

<p>Adoption of Newborn Infant</p>
<p>Editor: I admire your newspaper for serving the public. I have a request: I came to Shanghai from the rear. My service organization has been downsized, causing me to be laid off. My family has a large number of dependents, with five children, boys and girls. My wife is about to give birth within ten days. Due to difficult living conditions, I am unable to afford it. Therefore, I plan to send the newborn, whether male or female, to a reliable family without children for adoption. If interested, please send a letter to Chong Shou, c/o Yonglong Silver Shop at the intersection of North Shaanxi Road and Tiantong Road, so that I can send the infant. This is a last resort.

<h3>Evaluation System; Cotton Fabric Industry Responds First; Raw Fabrics from Wuxi and Changzhou Are Higher Than Those in Shanghai; Leading Brands Doing 100,000 Yuan But No Goods Available</h3>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper] The fabric market was still stable yesterday. It opened in the morning with a rising trend, but due to monetary issues, procurement turned silent and sales also became sluggish. Fangjian's release of fabric for sale, the working capital of fellow traders, mostly remains for use after approval to purchase. Leading fine cloth is doing 100,000 yuan, with a lack of goods for supply. Wufu is doing 91,000 yuan, poplin is a little under 3,000 yuan. The release price for Fangjian's goods, fine cloth increased by 2,000 yuan, poplin is at the original price. Fine cloth 3A color ball and Wufu Xiantao are both 80,000 yuan. Specialty cloth shops, Qingdao goods, Five-Star City cloth, are supplied to dyeing factories for purchase, at the same price as fine cloth. The market situation in the afternoon was downstream, with prices falling by 3,000 to 5,000 yuan. Poplin has entered the 100,000 yuan range, and fine cloth has entered the 90,000 yuan range.</p>
<p>Since the mayor convened a discussion the day before yesterday and instructed to suppress and stabilize prices, the Cotton Fabric Industry Association immediately convened a joint meeting of supervisors and directors yesterday. The representatives who attended the municipal government meeting stated the mayor's intention. All those in charge expressed anxiety. It was decided to hire elders and leaders in the industry to form an evaluation committee to study concrete countermeasures. The Southern Association's autumn sacrifice is on the 6th of this month, and fellow traders are expected to have a beautiful gathering. It is heard that they will solicit opinions on the spot to adjust supply and demand and balance market prices. After the meeting, according to a certain authoritative person, the rising trend of fabric prices is indeed not small. Only by suppressing the high profits of the original manufacturers, reducing the added cost of repeated buying and selling, reducing interest rates, and advancing the delivery period of manufacturers can the losses incurred by vendors be reduced, transportation be facilitated, and the hidden losses in bidding and allocation of goods be avoided. Moreover, it is said that the middle-ten days of the month are the peak season for actual sales in the gold-nine-silver-ten months. Because of the high prices of goods from other ports, the fabric prices in this city will rise accordingly. According to its revealed news, the raw fabrics produced by yarn factories in Changzhou and Wuxi were originally one of the important sources for this city. Recently, prices in these places have continued to rise. At the end of last week, 20-count yarn in that production area was around 2.4 million yuan per piece. Some fabric factories have to hand over one piece of yarn to exchange for eleven pounds of fine cloth and 23 pieces of fabric, then the price of each piece has reached more than 100,000 yuan, which is more expensive than in this city. It is also heard that most dyeing and weaving factories have reduced their inventory in September, with some making explicit profits and others suffering implicit losses. Fabric shops have recently had two in Nanyang Bridge and Dapu Bridge that were crushed by high-interest loans, and due to the rapid rise in prices, they were unable to replenish after selling out, and finally declared bankruptcy. The joy and suffering are uneven.</p>

The 42 double yarn strand finally reached a new high price of 3.6 million, a huge increase of 200,000 yuan compared to the previous day. However, the spot goods are still very rare. The huge amount of yarn and cloth produced by the Qingdao Factory of the Textile Construction Corporation is being vigorously sought to be transported to Shanghai to meet the needs due to transportation difficulties.</p>

<h3>Speculative Effect is Obvious Rayon Crashed Yesterday Off-Market Transactions Shouted Down Nearly One Million</h3>
<p>Rayon was rumored yesterday that 5,000 boxes of Japanese goods had arrived, and the market was therefore in a severe slump, with a difference of nearly one million yuan compared to the previous day, which shows that the previous few days of frantic price increases had a speculative effect.

After that, although there were rebounds, the rise always exceeded the previous high price, so the scattered parties were fearless. Even if there were many people who generally made profits, their feet were very lively. Small stocks were all followers, and Qinxing was even more eclipsed, and the atmosphere was deserted. The chips of various cold stocks were scarce in the investment search, and the tug-of-war situation extended to about 11:15 am. The buying enthusiasm rebounded. Tongyi first made progress under No. 22, and Huidar reached the limit. Therefore, buyers chose the cheap ones and the rise began.

<h3>Ministry of Finance Replies to Chamber of Commerce Telegram: Differential Exchange Rates Difficult to Implement Crackdown on Luxury Goods Awaits Overall Planning</h3>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce, for the current tariff and foreign exchange system, telegraphed the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Finance and Economics, listing (1) stepping up the crackdown on imports of non-essential and luxury goods, (2) adopting a foreign exchange grading system, and (3) striving to formulate commercial treaties suitable for the entire trade policy, in order to save the economic crisis. Yesterday, it received a telegram reply from the Ministry of Finance, promising to consider and plan for the three points requested. The original text of the Ministry of Finance's reply telegram is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>According to the Agency Letter No. 22 dated July 9, 1946, the current tariff policy and exchange settlement methods cannot be coordinated with the principles of economic construction, and three methods are proposed for selection and implementation, etc. The Ministry has checked that promoting the import of essential goods and suppressing the import of luxury goods is the principle that should be followed for reconstruction and construction. For this principle to be implemented as an administrative order, it is necessary to carefully examine the types and quantities of imported goods in order to take reasonable measures. This year's import trade has gradually increased, and examining the import statistics of Jianghai Customs in May, the total import value was 81.3 billion yuan in national currency, of which construction equipment such as engines, railway passenger cars, freight cars, sleepers, and vehicle parts, and industrial raw materials such as cotton, hardware ingots, chemical products, dyes, leather, and rubber, totaled 61.1 billion yuan, accounting for about three-quarters of the total import value. The remaining one-quarter, with cotton cloth, medicines, oils, and paper as the main items, are also materials suitable for current economic needs. As for luxury goods, they have been strictly cracked down on in accordance with the ban issued by the government, and investigations and seizures have been strengthened to prevent smuggling. Now, regarding the design of imported goods, the government has established an Import Design Committee under the Supreme Economic Committee to comprehensively review and plan. The first item suggested by the chamber, stepping up the crackdown on imports of non-essential and luxury goods, etc., should be waited for the government to investigate and plan as a whole. Also, the second item originally suggested, adopting a foreign exchange grading system, etc., after investigation, the implementation of differential exchange rates has many difficulties. In order to encourage exports and balance import trade, the government has adjusted foreign exchange rates and specially approved exemptions from export taxes. As for the third item originally suggested, commercial treaties should be formulated to suit the entire trade policy, and the opinions of the national industry and commerce should be collected before signing the treaties in order to show seriousness. According to the previous situation, in addition to the branch, it is appropriate to inform you by telegram.</p>
<h3>Tea Manufacturing Loan of 1 Billion Interest at 3% Term of Three Months</h3>

The rumor that a 10 billion yuan tea loan will be launched is not true.</p>
<h3>Plush Yarn Soars</h3>
<p>Silky plush yarn, recently due to the soaring prices of raw yarn and rayon, the prices of various grades of goods have skyrocketed. The magnitude of the rise is no less than that of American Melton, and even exceeds it. In addition, starting this month, dyeing fees will increase by 150% compared to last month. Therefore, the limited amount of goods from the enemy side are unwilling to quote prices. It is said that the current market price and the cost of weaving are still far from each other.</p>

<p>[United Press International, Mexico City, 30th] Mexico City recently announced a ban on the shipment of high-grade cotton to the United States and other countries until Mexico's own needs are met. The Financial Secretary of the National Export Council said that the ban was the result of Mexico's current lack of cotton. It is believed that Mexico's move is to prevent the United States from stepping up its purchases from Mexico due to this year's poor cotton harvest.</p>

<h3>City Schools' Levy of "Respect the Teacher" Fees Violates City Council Resolution; Reportedly, the Mayor Will Order a Stop to the Collection</h3>
<p>The collection of "respect the teacher" fees by municipal schools in this city has been met with opposition from all sectors. The City Council has proposed as many as seven motions regarding this matter, the reasons being: Public national schools should not collect tuition fees, as clearly stipulated by law. The collection of "respect the teacher" fees by municipal primary schools is a disguised form of tuition, which violates the central government's fundamental principle of universal national education. Municipal secondary schools already have tuition fee regulations, and the additional collection of "respect the teacher" fees is a double burden that citizens cannot bear. At a time when the people are impoverished and many are out of school, how can the government turn a blind eye? Three measures were established: (1) Municipal primary schools shall no longer collect disguised tuition fees under any name. (2) Municipal secondary schools shall not arbitrarily collect "respect the teacher" fees. (3) The base salaries of municipal school teachers may be adjusted and increased by the Education Bureau in accordance with fair principles. The general assembly resolved: Please instruct the municipal government to order municipal schools to stop collecting "respect the teacher" fees in order to ease the burden on citizens. It has been reported that municipal schools continue to collect "respect the teacher" fees, in violation of the City Council's resolution. It is reported that Mayor Wu is also dissatisfied with this and has instructed the Education Bureau to order the schools to stop collecting fees.</p>
<p>[Another Report] National education is compulsory education, and the Ministry of Education has repeatedly issued orders to restrict fees. However, the local education authorities in this city have come up with a novel idea: all municipal national schools collect "respect the teacher" fees, 30,000 yuan per student for senior primary schools, and 20,000 yuan per student for junior primary schools and kindergartens. They arbitrarily collect fees under fabricated names, which violates the fundamental principle of national education. During the City Council meeting last month, many councilors questioned Li Ximou, Deputy Director of the Education Bureau, orally. At that time, Deputy Director Li was unable to defend himself and had no answer. Subsequently, the City Council passed a resolution: National schools shall not collect disguised tuition fees – "respect the teacher" fees. Recently, municipal national schools have not complied with the resolution and have instead forced students' families to pay "respect the teacher" fees within a limited time. If they do not pay, they will be expelled from school. It is reported that the education authorities intend to continue collecting "respect the teacher" fees before the City Council's resolution is delivered, claiming "the early bird catches the worm." The reporter believes that this measure not only violates the City Council's resolution but also neglects the responsibilities of educational administration. Deputy Director Li was present when the City Council proposed this motion, but he turned a deaf ear and did not stop it, which is deeply不满 by the citizens of the entire city. Furthermore, it is reported that municipal schools have decided to continue collecting "respect the teacher" fees for this semester, but children of public education personnel can request exemptions. It is reported that the municipal primary schools have begun notifying students' parents to start collecting fees as of yesterday. According to a report by the Mainland News Agency reporter, some teachers told students, "If you do not pay the 'respect the teacher' fee, your conduct score may be deducted."</p>
<h3>Jiaotong University Staff and Students Going North Rush to Register</h3>
<p>The youth leagues of Tangshan Jiaotong University and Beiping Jiaotong University established a service station in Shanghai to assist in the restoration after the war, and have successively sent eight batches of staff and students. It is reported that the seventh batch of registered staff and students will take the Ministry of Economic Affairs' Fuel Committee coal ship Helga Moller north on the fifth of this month, and the procedures for the eighth batch (old students from both schools and new students from Tangshan) are being rushed through. The station originally planned to stop registration on September 30 and close down, but more than 100 staff and students from afar have not yet arrived in Shanghai, and new students from Beiping Jiaotong University have been unable to complete registration and boarding procedures due to the late release of admission lists. Therefore, the registration deadline for ship berths has been extended to the sixth of this month. Faculty, staff, and new and old students from both schools can go to the station at No. 180 Xiamen Road in this city to register before the sixth of this month.</p>
<h3>Qualification Examination for Middle School and Normal School Teachers Completed; Education Bureau Reveals Results After Separate Review</h3>

<h3>Southeast United University to Organize Alumni Association</h3>
<p>Since the Pacific War, patriotic young students in Shanghai have moved inland one after another. The Ministry of Education established the National Southeast United University in Jinhua to accommodate teachers and students who had withdrawn from Shanghai, Hong Kong, and Macau. He Bingsong, President of Jinan University, and Hu Jianzhong, President of the Southeast Daily, presided over the preparations. Before two months had passed, the enemy invaded, and the entire faculty and students of Jinlan safely retreated to Jianguan on foot under the leadership of President He. The Ministry of Education ordered Southeast United University to merge into Jinan University and Yingshi University, respectively. The students were sadly dispersed, but it was of great significance in the history of wartime education. Now that the War of Resistance has been won, they have returned to Shanghai one after another and jointly initiated the organization of an alumni association to share old friendships. All alumni of the United University can register at Zhou Qizhong (First Section, Civil Affairs Office, Police Headquarters, Zhouzhou Road, telephone 17590-13), Shi Meixuan (Heng Heng Hardware Store, Puan Lane, Yongan Street, telephone 85755), and Lu Derun (Chengde Company, Room 412, Guohua Building, 356 Beijing Road, telephone 97551) in order to convene a general meeting on a selected date.</p>

<h3>Scholarship Basketball Benefit Game: Ever-Victorious Army Unstoppable; Qunsheng Defeats Giants Again; Wu Yusi 35 Points, Giants' Defense Shattered; Wang Xuezhe Buys Charity Ball for 2.5 Million</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The Qunsheng and Giants teams played a charity basketball game yesterday at the Municipal Gymnasium at 8:00 p.m. to raise scholarship funds. The order yesterday was excellent. The deployment of military police was justified, but the removal of all the leather chairs in the stadium to accommodate twice as many spectators was a successful attempt. As a result of the game, the beginning was tense, but afterwards, due to superior ability, Qunsheng easily won with a score of 52 to 35. The first half was 27 to 17, with Qunsheng also leading. At the end of the first half, Wang Weijun hosted an auction of a charity ball, starting with a price of 350,000. After bidding, the philanthropist Wang Xuezhe, president of the Student Daily, bought it for 2.5 million yuan, benefiting the students, which is commendable. At the end of the third quarter, Chen Ruhui, director of the Loan Fund Committee, reported the income, totaling 13,116,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Performance Captivates</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Giants adopted a man-to-man defense, showing a decisive determination. The first quarter was still tight. From the second quarter onwards, Qunsheng used all their skills, such as the fake enticement of Zhang Wenzhang, Chen Jinde, and Cai Wenhua, which was very threatening and the opponent was bound to fall into their trap, which was wonderful and captivating. In yesterday's game, Cai Wenzhang had the greatest success. With his short stature, he was able to disrupt the ball that the enemy had already obtained and used wonderful passes to block. All of this was a magical performance, and there are simply no words to describe its characteristics. After seven major battles, it has been proven that there is a difference between the Qunsheng team and the teams in Shanghai. The Giants cannot stop its edge. There are still two battles against Enkas and Hualian. In addition to predicting their victory, we are very willing to see more transcendent performances.</p>
<p>As If Entering No Man's Land</p>
<p>Yesterday, the first players to appear were Chen Jinde, Chen Jinzhi, Cai Wenhua, Cai Wenzhang, and Yang Renhui for Qunsheng, and Tao Bolinji, Funik, Stevenson, Sasskin, and Kaiji Milov for the Giants.

Tao Bolinji raised his hands and scored first, and the audience applauded. Qunsheng captain Chen immediately returned the favor, and Cai Wenhua followed suit, leading 4 to 2. Funik dribbled in, forcing a tie at 4 to 4. Then Tao Bolinji scored twice, and Qunsheng's Wenzhang and Jinde each scored once, resulting in a tie of 6 to 6 and 8 to 8. At the end of the first quarter, the visitors led by one point at 10 to 8.</p>
<p>Another Battle Begins, Voices Rise</p>
<p>The Giants replaced Sasskin with Yelong. Qunsheng used all their skills, and Chen Jinzhi, Cai Wenhua, and Chen Jinde seemed to enter no man's land, and the score rose rapidly. In an instant, they led with 22 to 9, letting the kite fly high. The Giants' Tao Bolinji raised his arms and shouted, repeatedly breaking through the basket, and Stevenson also contributed, and the score was slightly closer. At the end of the first half, the visitors led with 27 to 17.</p>
<p>Shooting Like a String of Pearls</p>
<p>After a break, the battle resumed. Qunsheng replaced Yang Renhui with Cai Lianke, and Cai Wenhua opened the scoring. Tao Bolinji immediately returned the color. Tao was in good form and scored two more goals in a row. Qunsheng called a timeout and then brought Renhui back onto the field, replacing Lianke. Jinzhi scored wonderfully, and Qunsheng ended the third quarter with 37 to 24.</p>
<p>In the last quarter, the Giants' N Sasskin scored the bullseye first. The Qunsheng players shot like a string of pearls, and Qunsheng led with 42 to 26. The Giants tried to rally, but Qunsheng pressed hard. When it was 49 to 30, the Giants' Stevenson fouled out for the fifth time, and Yelong replaced him again. When Cai Wenhua sprinted in and dribbled in, the bell rang loudly. As a result, Qunsheng defeated the Giants again with 52 to 35, reporting seven consecutive victories.</p>

<h3>Bumper Harvest in Zhejiang Province, Impressive Yields - A Special Dispatch from Hangzhou on the 24th by Correspondent Chu Yusheng</h3>
<p>While the flames of war rage and people are mired in suffering elsewhere, Zhejiang Province has, on the whole, been peaceful and tranquil. This quiet province relies on agricultural production to maintain its reputation for prosperity. Although it is declared a grain-deficient province, most of its people still depend on rice paddies for their livelihoods. It is said that Zhejiang Province lacks accurate scientific statistics regarding its grain shortage. The calculation is based on an assumption that each of the 21 million people in Zhejiang consumes two "shi" (a unit of dry measure, approx. 120 lbs) of rice per year, totaling 42 million "shi" of rice. With an average annual yield of one and a half "shi" per mu (approx. 1/6 acre), Zhejiang Province can only claim to produce about 2 million "shi" of rice. Thus, these 2 million "shi" can only support the lives of 1 million people, while the remaining 20 million rely on rice imported from elsewhere. However, rice from Hsia-shih in Zhejiang is often transported to Shanghai, as well as Chia-ting, Chia-shan, and Ping-hu. Wenzhou, being near the sea, also ships rice to Shanghai. Therefore, roughly calculating, Zhejiang probably only has slightly over 1 million "dan" (another unit of dry measure, approx. 100 lbs) of rice. How can it sustain the lives of the entire province? Some say it is supplied by Jiangsu and Anhui provinces. Furthermore, there are many people living in the mountainous areas of Zhejiang who rely on coarse grains, such as sweet potatoes, corn, and wheat, for their sustenance.</p>
<p>Grain Shortage? Surplus Grain?</p>
<p>Zhejiang has 37,900,697 mu of farmland and 109,129,604 "shi mu" of mountainous land. The mountains are densely forested, and the farmland is rich with crops. Zhejiang rarely experiences famine disasters. Therefore, before we have accurate scientific statistics, we cannot definitively confirm whether there is a grain shortage or a surplus. Mr. Xia, who has served as an important advisor in Zhejiang for over ten years, told me: "The annual yield of rice paddies is based solely on estimation. There are no accurate statistics. Even if the province creates detailed charts and sends them to the counties, it's questionable whether the counties have specialized personnel to conduct the investigation. If they are sent to the townships, it's even more confusing. Therefore, to investigate the annual yield of rice paddies, it is necessary to first measure the land clearly, and then have the province directly dispatch personnel with expertise in both land administration and agriculture to investigate!" Thus, the reliability of all past figures is highly questionable.</p>
<p>After the war, it is even more chaotic. Some of the land survey registers are incomplete and need to be resurveyed. Many fields are barren and need to be reclaimed. In any case, if Zhejiang wants to maintain its reputation for prosperity, it must start by organizing its agriculture and achieving a balanced ratio of food supply.</p>
<p>Harvest Yields of 70% to 80%</p>
<p>During the transition from spring to summer this year, flash floods occurred in the upper reaches of the Qiantang River, inundating some of the rice paddies. During the hottest part of summer, pest infestations occurred in areas such as Yu-hang, Lin-an, Yu-qian, and Chang-hua. When the farmers, who depend on the weather for their livelihood, could find no assistance, they could only hope to protect their fields through welcoming gods and holding sacrificial ceremonies. Fortunately, things went smoothly. The water receded, the pests gradually diminished, and there was still a rice harvest. According to a certain senator from Yu-hang, Yu-hang still has about 70% to 80% of the usual yield. I visited the Department of Farmland and Food within the Department of Construction, and they all said that the overall harvest yield for the province this year is considered a bumper year, probably around 80%, or at least 70%!</p>
<p>We, of course, have the same doubts about this 70% to 80% harvest figure as we do about the "grain shortage" or "surplus." However, it can be said that it is "generally accurate." Now, we need to further study how this year's "bumper harvest" was formed. Was it because our government provided many methods for improving farming techniques? Did it build many water conservancy projects? Did it improve many fertilizers? Did it bring much joy to farmers' lives, either materially or spiritually?</p>
<p>More Assistance for Rural Areas</p>
<p>Upon closer examination, everything still depends on the common sense passed down by farmers for thousands of years, the superstitions passed down for thousands of years, such as the "Dragon King" and worshiping the "Field God and Field Goddess," and relying entirely on "favorable weather" to fortunately obtain this bumper harvest. This is something that those in government and those who enjoy the fruits of the city should deeply reflect upon.</p>
<p>Now, some early rice has already been harvested, while some fields have not yet been harvested. When the reporter was in the rear area in the Southwest, he initiated and took action to assist farmers in harvesting rice, which brought immense joy to the farmers. At this time, we believe that rural Zhejiang will also feel the strain of manpower. Many officers and soldiers in the cities, and many people in the cities, should also initiate efforts to assist farmers in harvesting rice. Help them according to the principles of not being overly demanding or wasteful, and they will feel extraordinarily comforted. Originally, today's metropolises were all built upon rural areas. If we do not integrate with the rural communities and allow them to collapse, then any metropolis will be destroyed invisibly.</p>
<p>Plowing Rice Roots for Scientific Farming</p>
<p>After the autumn harvest, we will enter the cold winter. Winter plowing is the best farming method because plowing the fields this winter, turning over the rice roots, will cause the hibernating insects to die underground, and the rotten rice roots can be used as fertilizer, making spring plowing easier next year and ensuring a good harvest in the fall. Therefore, this year's winter plowing is very important. We need to conduct good publicity in advance and hold a celebration in each township afterward to comfort these hardworking farmers.</p>
<p>Next spring, we need to research agricultural tools and provide widespread agricultural loans. After studying these agricultural tools, we need to promote their use. Agricultural loans must truly be placed in the hands of the farmers and absolutely not be exploited by intermediaries. We also need to organize the construction of various water conservancy projects and prepare insect-repellent powders and equipment early. If there is extra strength, the county magistrates of each county should personally go down to the villages to visit the farmers, solve their problems, improve their housing, or reduce their difficulties in clothing, food, and transportation, such as rationing reasonably priced fabrics and food, and building village roads. Furthermore, we need to hold many meaningful competitions, such as cattle plowing competitions, farmhouse cleanliness competitions, rural children's competitions, vegetable harvesting competitions, and fruit harvesting competitions.</p>
<p>The above is only a portion of the rural improvement initiatives. If we want to have results, it is not very difficult to do so. We must not always circle around in the cities, listening to the words of "those who speak on behalf of the people" all day long. We must personally go down to the countryside, personally see the actual difficulties and hardships, and then actually solve them for them.</p>
<p>Yes, to ensure that Zhejiang Province's farmland always yields a bumper harvest and its land always remains prosperous in the future, we must take the path of scientific improvement.</p>
<h3>A Brilliant New Page in Sino-Siamese Diplomatic Relations: A Grand Ceremony for Ambassador Li Presenting His Credentials</h3>
<p>— A Dispatch from Bangkok on September 17th by Our Traveling Reporter Jie Sun</p>
<p>Intercourse between Siam and our country began in the Qin Dynasty, and by the Tang Dynasty, relations had become even closer. During the late Qing Dynasty, our country suffered many misfortunes, and the Siamese tributes were discontinued. Overseas Chinese in Siam number over three million. If we analyze their lineage, there are very few purely Siamese people. Those who hold prominent positions are all descendants of overseas Chinese. The Seventh King publicly acknowledged during a speech at a Chinese school in 1928 that he himself had Chinese ancestry. Siam's prosperity and development today are entirely due to the contributions of overseas Chinese. However, because our country was beset by internal unrest and external threats, overseas Chinese abroad were like orphaned children, subjected to others' bullying and humiliation. During the reign of Plaek Phibunsongkhram, the situation of overseas Chinese in Siam was particularly precarious. After the end of the war, our country sent a delegation to Siam, and after many negotiations, a treaty of friendship was finally signed. With the establishment of diplomatic relations, over three million overseas Chinese were also able to receive normal treatment and protection from now on. This can be called a brilliant page in our diplomatic history. After arriving in Bangkok on September 6, Li Tieh-cheng, our first ambassador to Siam, actively handled the affairs of opening the embassy. It was decided to hold a flag-raising ceremony on the 17th, and the Siamese side notified us that the credentials would be presented on the same day.</p>
<p>The Blue Sky with a White Sun Flag Rises to the Top of the Flagpole</p>
<p>On that day, the sky was clear and refreshing, and the national flags of China and Siam fluttered everywhere. All overseas Chinese were overjoyed and inspired. At exactly nine o'clock, the flag-raising ceremony began. Those who participated in this solemn and grand ceremony included all the staff of the embassy, representatives of over 270 overseas Chinese organizations, faculty and students of over 20 Chinese schools, and over 10,000 overseas Chinese. Ambassador Li, accompanied by Military Attaché Zhuo Hsien-shu, Consul-General Sun Ping-chien, Secretary Ouyang Chun, and Secretary Qin Wu, walked to the flagpole on the large lawn of the embassy. After everyone stood at attention, the ceremony began. First, the national anthem was sung, followed by the national flag anthem. Amidst the melodious singing, Ambassador Li slowly raised the brand-new, large national flag. When the Blue Sky with a White Sun flag rose to the top of the flagpole, which was over ten "zhang" (approx. 10 feet) tall, everyone bowed in salute. Ambassador Li then delivered a speech, stating: Today is the first day the embassy raises its national flag, and it is also the first day the Republic of China has an envoy stationed in this country. This day not only marks a new era in Sino-Siamese diplomatic history but also a new era in the history of relations between the two nations. As everyone knows, Siam is one of our major neighboring countries. Overseas Chinese have resided in this country for a long time. For thousands of years, the Chinese and Siamese people have lived in harmony, just like family. Whether in terms of culture, economy, bloodline, or even social life, both sides have established an inseparable relationship. In order to consolidate and enhance this relationship, our government sent a delegation to Siam at the beginning of this year, led by myself, to negotiate with the Siamese government and sign the Sino-Siamese Treaty of Friendship. This treaty is the foundation for establishing friendly diplomatic relations between China and Siam in the future. Now, although the foundation for Sino-Siamese diplomatic relations has been established, in order to promote even more friendly relations between China and Siam in the future... This historically valuable flag-raising ceremony was then declared complete. At 10:30 a.m., Pat Brem, Director of Protocol of the Siamese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, arrived at our embassy with four specially prepared limousines to receive Ambassador Li. Ambassador Li and his party were greeted by two royal military attendants and a royal master of ceremonies. The master of ceremonies escorted Ambassador Li into the main hall.</p>
<p>Mutual Interests, Close Cooperation</p>
<p>After Ambassador Li performed the customary greeting and the Regent responded in kind, Ambassador Li stepped forward to present his credentials and read a eulogy: "Your Highness the Regent, I am deeply honored to present my credentials as the specially appointed plenipotentiary ambassador of the Republic of China. I respectfully request that Your Highness convey to His Majesty the King of Siam the sincere wishes of President Chiang for the prosperity of your country. At the same time, I am instructed to express, on behalf of the President, to your royal family, government, and people, our condolences and deep sympathy for the passing of the late King Ananda. The late King's benevolence was widely bestowed upon our overseas Chinese residing in your country, which has caused our people to deeply admire him. Upon hearing of his passing, our entire country mourned. China and Siam have long been linked by cultural, religious, economic, and blood ties. Since prehistoric times, Chinese people have immigrated to your country and settled here. Today, there are over three million Chinese descendants who can live in harmony with your country, just like family. This fact alone is enough to prove the existence of harmony and friendship between the two great nations. Indeed, the relationship between China and Siam has reached such a point that it should be regarded as that of brotherly countries. People from either country residing in the other should not be viewed as outsiders. Chinese residing in Siam and Siamese residing in China will be free to travel, reside, trade, hire workers, and engage in various occupations in their respective host countries without any restrictions. Furthermore, they will eternally enjoy the freedom of assembly, association, publication, and educating their children. This is my sincere hope. During the Japanese occupation of Siam, the Chinese government and its people not only expressed deep sympathy for the people of this country but also did their utmost to assist the Free Thai Movement, which bravely fought for national freedom and independence. I am pleased to be able to say this. In order to express its goodwill towards your government and recognizing the importance of close cooperation between the two countries on matters of mutual interest, the Chinese government has decided to send an ambassador to Siam. Since the common goal of both countries is peace and security, we can carry out reconstruction and construction work and build a better world. The Chinese government's foreign policy has no other purpose than this. In order to achieve this goal, our government is prepared to fully cooperate with your government. I consider it a rare privilege to be stationed in our brotherly neighboring country as the first diplomatic envoy of the Republic of China. However, what makes me particularly happy is that I had the good fortune to come to your country several months ago as the head of the delegation to Siam and to represent our government in signing the Sino-Siamese Treaty of Friendship, which codifies the long-standing friendship between China and Siam. This is especially gratifying to me. I fully understand the heavy responsibility that I am about to shoulder and am willing to do my utmost to fulfill my mission to the fullest extent possible, to cooperate with your government to enhance the closest relations between the two countries. This is not only necessary for maintaining peace and security in Asia but also beneficial for promoting the welfare of mankind." After Ambassador Li finished his speech, the Chairman of the Regency Council delivered a reply, stating: "In the name of the King of Siam, I am pleased to accept the credentials of Your Excellency as the Specially Appointed Plenipotentiary Ambassador of the Republic of China to the Kingdom of Siam. I extend the same sincere sentiments in response to President Chiang's wishes for prosperity. The King, royal family, and people of Siam are deeply grateful for President Chiang's condolences on the passing of the late King." After the Chairman of the Regency Council finished his reply, he introduced his officials who were present, and they exchanged pleasantries and shared champagne. The ceremony ended at 11:15 a.m. This new page in Sino-Siamese diplomatic history will forever remain an unforgettable memory in the hearts of over three million overseas Chinese.</p>

<h3>The Ghost Market in Xi'an</h3>
<p>— A Dispatch from Xi'an on the 10th by Special Correspondent Li Chi</p>
<p>"Ghost Market"—this strange term sounds like the name of a horror movie, and this far from "elegant" and mysterious place is actually known to everyone in Xi'an. For example, if you take a rickshaw and say you want to go to "Min Le Yuan" (the real name of "Ghost Market"), you'll have to explain. If you say "Ghost Market," you can be sure there won't be any mistakes.</p>
<p>After getting off the Longhai Railway at Xi'an Station, you'll pass through the bustling Shangren Road on the way to the city center, where you'll find the entrance to "Ghost Market." The "heart" and "embryo" of "Ghost Market" was originally the small "Min Le Yuan," but I don't know when it started slowly expanding eastward, growing to its current size. If you were to measure it lengthwise or widthwise, it's probably over two "li" (approx. 2/3 mile) in length. To take a "horseback view" tour of this four- or five-square-li area, it would take at least one or two hours.</p>
<p>Dawn Breaks, Ghosts Disperse, the Market Closes</p>
<p>"Ghost Market" is a "market" in name and in fact. In short: goods from China and abroad, ancient and modern, are all available. Here are a few examples: In terms of clothing, from the glass raincoats and suspenders of young ladies and gentlemen to the tattered cotton-padded coats stripped from corpses of beggars. In terms of food and drink, from the colorful cans representing "Golden Round Culture" to the leftovers from restaurants and taverns from the previous night, everything is available. Other examples include brand-new bicycles and car parts of unknown origin, "surplus materials" that represent the crimes of the "Imperial Army," such as venereal disease preventatives specifically for American soldiers, European-made contraceptives that were more expensive than gold a year ago, and Shanghai's yellow "the more poisonous, the more effective" dog-skin plasters... everything you can think of. Even opium, a drug that trades in human lives, it seems no one dares to guarantee there are no shady, secretive transactions taking place within "Ghost Market."</p>
<p>The "market" is named "Ghost" because, according to local "researchers," in the beginning, petty thieves gathered in this area every day before dawn to sell stolen goods. When dawn broke, the "ghosts" dispersed and the "market" closed. From then on, the name "Ghost Market" spread by word of mouth and became known to everyone. Later, it became a daytime used goods market, a general flea market, and the only "personal property auction house" for refugees. After the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan, it also served as a "clearinghouse" for the assets left behind by returning home. The "rise to prominence" of "Ghost Market" also came after the victory. Initially, many itinerant merchants went to Shanghai, Tianjin, and Henan to buy eastern goods to sell here at retail. Later, the scale and clout grew larger and larger. Today, it has become a center for wholesale of local and foreign goods, fabrics, and scrap materials. Many bosses who have very beautiful storefronts outside also set up stalls inside "Ghost Market." The busiest section is only a dozen or twenty feet long, with stalls on both sides stacked four to six deep. The first impression of walking into "Ghost Market" is that it's "crowded." The degree of "crowding" is comparable to that of the stock exchange.</p>
<p>Harmful Reverse Flow of Rural Trade</p>
<p>I don't know if there are any distorted markets like "Ghost Market" in other cities in China. It has nonstop transactions and sales 24 hours a day, but the "golden hours" are still before 9:00 a.m. Estimates suggest that the amount of money exchanged daily among the hundreds of wholesale merchants of foreign and miscellaneous goods and fabrics is enough to supply the entire annual budget of a province before the war. In terms of buyers, it's "nothing strange" for someone to "go to Ghost Market with millions of yuan." Whether it's looking at goods or haggling over prices, the old woman on the corner with trachoma who is almost blind selling the only piece of torn clothing she has is just as serious about doing business. On Sundays, clever housewives run from afar to buy a face towel to reduce the middleman's profit from the small merchants who wholesale from here. On this day, many low-level female civil servants also squeeze in to buy boxes of face powder and soap, with sweat dripping down their faces and their cheongsams wrinkled and soiled... This is not just a "market," it is truly a microcosm of the "world." I remember someone describing how complete the goods in a department store in a big city are by saying: "Everything is available except rice and coffins." But in the area of "Ghost Market," both rice and coffins are available.</p>
<p>A calm observation of this corner of the market provides countless data and evidence of many serious economic problems currently facing us. First, we see the alarming rate at which foreign goods, mainly American goods, have been dumped on the market in recent months. Of course, we cannot measure this using the standards of Shanghai, but when a rustic old villager smilingly buys a "glass comb" as if he has found a treasure and puts it in his mended cloth bag, I cannot help but shudder. A Florida orange sells for over ten thousand yuan per catty (meaning two and a half catties of oranges can be exchanged for one "shi" of wheat or one bolt of native cloth). It still has a market in "Ghost Market." Is this "trade" or "crime"?</p>
<h3>Dr. Cheng Futing, the New Ambassador to the United Kingdom</h3>
<p>Dr. Cheng Futing (Dr. F. T. Cheng), who served as an agent to the International Court of Justice at The Hague, is normally based in England, working as a lawyer. He has long enjoyed a prestigious reputation in both diplomatic and judicial circles overseas. Recently, a reporter traveled from France to England and paid him a special visit at the Chinese Embassy in the UK, located at 49 Portland Place, near Regent's Park. The embassy's decor exudes an antique charm. To use geography as a metaphor, it is like a world of tall trees. To use books as a metaphor, it is even more noble. Now, compared to the Chinese embassies in the UK, France, and the Netherlands, entering the UK embassy is like reading the magnificent history of the Han Dynasty, entering the French embassy is like viewing a masterpiece of Shakespeare, and entering the Dutch embassy is like reciting a collection of poems praising the virtues of Dutch philosophers.</p>
<p>If our compatriots still remember Dr. Sun Yat-sen's difficult affairs in London and then visit the British Embassy, then the great historical memories will be clearly as if they were just a month ago. Upon entering the landing area, one sees a statue of an ancient Buddha sitting facing one. Upstairs, there are large, beautiful flowers. Upon sitting down, there are deep blue dragon-patterned brocade couches and armchairs. Large vases are arranged along the window, and large bunches of bright red and white flowers are in full bloom, strikingly symbolizing the colors of the national emblem.</p>
<p>Ambassador Cheng's wife and children are still in Switzerland and have not yet come. Only his eldest son has come with him. He is served Western food every day, prepared by a chef left behind by the previous Ambassador Guo. The cooking is extremely exquisite.</p>
<p>The Ambassador's new book, written in English and titled "China Molded by Confucius," has just been published by Stevens, a London bookstore specializing in law books. The reporter sought it out at the bookstore at 16 Fleet Street and purchased a copy. The material is rich, and the intention is profound. It is truly an unprecedented treasure trove for promoting our ancient civilization abroad. Paper will be expensive in Luoyang. We await its success with anticipation.</p>
<p>This article is the first communication from Wang Wangren, recently traveling from the British capital. Mr. Wang has a well-known reputation in the journalistic world and is a strong advocate for overseas communications work. He served as an editor for this newspaper for many years. After graduating from the University of Washington in the United States, he traveled all over the world, working as a correspondent for this newspaper for decades as if it were a day. Later, due to the interruption of the war, he was missed by our compatriots for a long time. This time, he arrived in England from France and immediately sent us a new work, which is as welcome as a rare sound in an empty valley. We are extremely happy. Mr. Wang has also promised to send us a constant stream of articles in the future, which our readers will be happy to hear. We attach a few words to express our gratitude. (Editor)</p>
<h3>Jin Dynasty Bricks Discovered on Niutou Mountain in Qingjiang</h3>
<p>—A Dispatch from Qingjiang on the 10th by Rao Huiyuan</p>
<p>Niutou Mountain, located in the Qin Hu Township of Qingjiang County, Jiangxi, is approximately twenty "hua li" from Zhangshu Town. The soil of the mountain was washed away by rainwater, revealing an ancient tomb. According to local villagers, it was discovered during the Xianfeng and Tongzhi periods of the late Qing Dynasty. When the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom army infiltrated the area, many people took refuge inside, mistaking it for an ancient kiln. In recent years, after county residents Xu Yuanjing and Rao Huiyuan visited and examined it, the bricks were found to be inscribed with the Ningkang era name, leading them to conclude that it was a tomb from the Jin Dynasty. The tomb is located in a remote mountain, its opening collapsed and exposed, overgrown with thorns. Upon crawling inside, the dome-shaped brick mine can be seen. The tomb is constructed with three layers of bricks, which are quite solid. It is approximately two "zhang" deep (as observed from the ground level). The height is obscured by accumulated soil. The bricks are 36.3 cm long, 3.43 cm thick (the other side has no patterns or text and is 6.6 cm thick), 18.5 cm wide, and weigh 7.5 kg. They are inscribed with eleven characters: "Gui Family Tomb, Fifth Day of the Ninth Month, Second Year of Ningkang," or cloud-shaped patterns (the end of the brick also has three characters: "Gui Family Tomb," or cloud-shaped patterns). Ningkang was the era name of Emperor Xiaowu of the Jin Dynasty, dating back over 1,500 years, so there is no doubt that it is an ancient tomb from the Jin Dynasty. However, who Gui was is unknown and cannot be verified because the county gazetteer does not record it (there is no one with the surname Gui within a hundred li of the area). However, judging by its structure, it does not seem to be an ordinary tomb. Furthermore, the handwriting is simple and vigorous, with the feel of clerical script and regular script, similar to the characters on Jin Dynasty steles. As for whether there are steles and funerary objects buried inside the tomb, we cannot know the details without excavation. There are many abandoned tombs near the tomb, and the bricks are exposed on the surface. Occasionally, one or two complete ones are found, with clear cloud-shaped double-coin patterns and linen cloth patterns, which seem to be burial objects from before the Tang and Song Dynasties (recently, a brick with the Chuping era name was discovered near the Jin Dynasty tomb, but the handwriting is not as clear as that on the Jin Dynasty bricks, and it seems to be a Han Dynasty brick from the Three Kingdoms period). Excavation is currently underway, and it is possible that archaeological artifacts may be collected. If so, it will not be difficult to provide material for experts to conduct archaeological research.</p>

<p>The Handwriting Is Simple and Vigorous, Almost Identical to Jin Dynasty Calligraphy</p>

<h3>Expanding Soviet Influence in the Middle East Encounters Setbacks</h3>
<p>— Translated from the American World Journal, South</p>
<p>The Middle East is a arena where Britain, America, and the Soviet Union contend. Three months ago, the situation for Western countries was very unfavorable, but now the situation has changed, and the Soviet Union's plan to expand its influence in the Middle East has encountered major setbacks.</p>
<p>As for the goals of the contest between the two sides, one is to compete for oil resources, and the other is to ensure military security.</p>
<p>Everyone knows that beneath the mountains and deserts of the countries around the Persian Gulf lies one-third of the world's oil resources, which has attracted the attention of various countries.</p>
<p>According to the current situation, American oil companies control 42 percent of the total oil reserves in this area. They control all of Saudi Arabia's oil reserves, part of Iraq's oil reserves, and half of Kuwait's oil reserves.</p>
<p>British oil companies control 50 percent of the total oil reserves in this area. The Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, controlled by the British government, owns vast oil fields in southern Iran. In addition, Britain also has several oil fields in Iraq and Kuwait. As for the remaining part, it is in the hands of French and Dutch capitalists.</p>
<p>The Soviet Union has no oil fields in the Middle East, but it may obtain the oil rights in the vast oil fields in northern Iran.</p>
<p>The Importance of the Middle East Oil Fields Is Increasing Daily</p>
<p>Middle Eastern oil played a huge role in the United Nations' victory in World War II. As the production of old oil fields in other parts of the world decreases day by day, the importance of Middle Eastern oil fields is increasing.</p>
<p>The strategic importance of the Middle East is also very obvious. Because the British army will soon withdraw from Egypt, Britain must find new bases in the Middle East. The Suez Canal is the throat of the British Empire. The Persian Gulf, currently patrolled by the British Navy, is a passage to the Indian Ocean and a world trade route.</p>
<p>The Soviet Union and Iran have a very long common border, and it is only a day's journey from Iraq. The Soviet Union's interest in the Kurds, Azerbaijani democrats, Iranian politics, and Arab trends has allowed its influence to penetrate this region known for its oil production.</p>
<p>Due to factors such as oil resources and military security, the recent developments in the Middle East are becoming increasingly important. Now, let's briefly describe the setbacks that the Soviet Union has encountered in this area:</p>
<p>In Iran, the Soviet-backed left-wing party is gradually losing strength. Not long ago, the Tudeh Party was still arrogant and helped the Soviet Union obtain oil rights in northern Iran and autonomy for the Iranian province of Azerbaijan. The Tudeh Party was confident that it could win the upcoming elections and thus control the parliament. The trade unions controlled by the party even wanted to directly strike at Britain, calling for strikes in all British-owned oil fields.</p>
<p>But since then, the situation has changed. Arab mobs, under British instigation, crushed the strike movement and killed important trade union leaders. The local provincial government sent troops to imprison the remaining strike leaders. The Tehran government soon released the leaders of the Tudeh Party, but they were no longer able to operate in the oil company-controlled areas.</p>
<p>The most serious blow to the leftists was the success of the New Democratic Party formed by Prime Minister Sultanah. The party's platform sounded even more revolutionary than that of the Tudeh Party, but the original conservatives all rallied under the banner of the new party, aiming to weaken the Soviet-backed Tudeh Party. Therefore, the parliamentary elections have been delayed and delayed, and the longer the delay, the less chance the Tudeh Party has of success.</p>
<p>One thing is very important to the Soviet Union: the oil rights it obtained in northern Iran must be approved by the Iranian parliament on October 24, otherwise the previous agreement will become a piece of waste paper. There is currently no parliament in Iran. If the elections are not held quickly, it is unknown whether a parliament will be produced by October 24.</p>
<p>Whether the Middle East Can Be Stable Is Still Uncertain</p>
<p>After resolving the oil field strike, the British government soon issued a statement emphasizing the importance of Iran's oil resources and ordering the elite Indian 4th Division to be transferred from India to Basra in Iraq, only 30 miles from the Abadan oil field in Iran, which shows Britain's concern.</p>
<p>In Iraq, labor disputes often interrupt the production of the Mosul and Kirkuk oil fields. Under British guidance, the Iraqi government recently resolved a strike. There were some casualties before the strike was resolved, but the workers' demands for improved living conditions have been somewhat satisfied. In addition, the Iraqi government is arresting anti-government elements, which has anti-communist significance.</p>
<p>In Saudi Arabia, there are fewer labor disputes and the people are more primitive, but King Ibn Saud has issued an order banning communist activities to prevent problems before they occur. The most difficult problem in the country is the economic problem, but the US Export-Import Bank has lent it 10 million US dollars, which can promote Saudi Arabia's loyalty to the United States.</p>
<p>Egypt has also taken measures to suppress communist activities. Many suspects who distributed inciting propaganda have been imprisoned, and those who have not been imprisoned have received warnings to stop propaganda, otherwise they will have to leave Egypt.</p>
<p>Turkey recently elected a new cabinet, in which right-wing conservatives have a great advantage. The Foreign Minister, known for his opposition to Soviet demands, has remained in office.</p>
<p>The above situation shows that in the recent struggle between Britain and the Soviet Union in the Middle East, the Soviet Union's power has suffered setbacks, and Britain and the United States have temporarily prevented the Soviet Union's expansion in this area. However, whether the situation in the Middle East can be stable for a long time is still uncertain. Given the Soviet Union's long history of careful planning for the Middle East, it will counterattack as soon as it has the opportunity.</p>
<p>The rise and fall of the influence of Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union in the Middle East is of great importance to world peace.</p>
<h3>Ten American Experts Review the Possibility of a Third World War</h3>
<p>— Written by Diplomatic Reporter Famingzi, Translated by the Newspaper Editorial Office</p>
<p>"Will there be a third world war?" This is a question that people all over the world urgently want to get an answer to. United Press International correspondent and diplomatic affairs expert Franz had informal talks with ten experts in government and diplomatic circles whose daily work is closely related to relations with the Soviet Union. Now we will translate the conclusions he obtained after summarizing the opinions of all parties. According to his investigation, the possibility of a third world war is still very remote. The recent trend in the international arena is moving towards world equilibrium, replacing the European equilibrium of the 19th century, but powerful economic and social forces are playing their role, limiting international disputes to the diplomatic field without resorting to force.</p>
<p>The most important issue at present is none other than the relationship between the United States and the Soviet Union. At the same time, this issue is also the most complex, and even the most capable diplomats dare not make hasty judgments, but they all believe that the current difficulties between the United States and the Soviet Union are due to the lack of understanding and understanding between Washington and Moscow in the post-war period.</p>
<p>The Paris Peace Conference is still in session. Many people think that arguing red-faced in the meeting place is enough to sharpen the opposition of opinions between countries, but people with diplomatic and economic experience feel that talking about the problems that have been bothering them in public is not without benefit to solving the problems. Another group of people believe that if countries can use notes to replace endless speeches when discussing disputed issues, it may be more effective, because this can make the work compact and avoid wasting a lot of unnecessary talk.</p>
<h3>Between the US and the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>— South</p>
<p>A Gulf Is Drawn</p>
<p>Between the United States and the Soviet Union, a gulf seems to be drawn due to the different economic principles and systems of the two countries, but due to their urgent needs, there may be long-term mutual adaptation and even cooperation.</p>
<p>According to diplomats, Stalin occupies a strong position in today's world, because as a result of World War II, the Soviet Union has gained greatly in terms of territory and influence, but most of these gains are accomplished facts rather than legality. Therefore, the most favorable attitude towards the Soviet Union is to continuously conduct international negotiations step by step.</p>
<p>As for Britain, due to many difficult problems within the British Empire, it is in a secondary position in deciding the fate of the world. Many observers believe that the future of the world will be largely determined by the relationship between the United States and the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>US Secretary of State Byrnes' speech in Stuttgart advocating German unification was unanimously praised by those who study international issues, because it guaranteed that the United States will continue to strive for the economic revival of Europe and world peace. From a good perspective, Byrnes' views may become a new agenda for the Four Foreign Ministers' meeting to discuss the German issue; from a bad perspective, Byrnes' proposal can at least promote economic cooperation between Western European countries.</p>
<p>As for the question of whether the situation in Europe will cause a new war, there are two answers: some people say bluntly "no," while others believe "at least not within five years." The first view is based on the saying that the United States will never launch a war unless attacked. The Soviet Union can enhance its position in the world without the danger of war. As for the second view, it is that the Soviet Union is currently technically incapable of fighting a war, but in the future, if it cannot achieve its goals through normal means, it may resort to war.</p>
<p>Current Affairs Commentary</p>
<h3>A World Startled Several Times in One Evening</h3>
<p>— Chu Yukun</p>
<p>The Greek Civil War Is Expanding The Situation in the Straits Is Again in Turmoil</p>
<p>In recent weeks, politicians and diplomats from various countries have been making alarming statements, saying that a new war crisis is brewing or that the opposition between the two worlds is inevitable. These remarks have made our nerves extremely tense. However, Stalin published a statement to the reporter of the Sunday Times, expressing his disbelief that war would break out again, which is tantamount to giving the world a dose of cooling medicine, immediately sobering many people up. It has also suddenly clarified the political atmosphere between countries.</p>
<p>There Is Currently No War Crisis</p>
<p>Stalin met with a reporter from the British Sunday Times on September 24 and issued a written statement. He frankly stated: (1) He supports the withdrawal of US troops from China; (2) There is currently no war crisis; (3) Monopolizing the secrets of atomic energy is enough to endanger world peace; (4) He hopes to strengthen British-Soviet cultural relations.</p>
<p>This statement immediately aroused good reactions in the public opinion circles of various countries after it was published in the newspaper. Soviet personnel believed that if Stalin said there would be no war, there would be no war in the international arena, so they felt very gratified. This is also the case in Britain and the United States; Wallace believed that Stalin's statement would make millions of peace-loving people around the world feel infinite hope, and believed that Stalin had recognized that communism and capitalism can run parallel without contradicting each other. In Britain, it is even considered that Stalin's statement is the only factor that can stabilize people's hearts after the war. But in our opinion, Stalin's statement contains the subtle effect of being pro-British and anti-American.</p>
<p>The Soviet Union Raises the China Issue</p>
<p>The Soviet Union failed repeatedly at the Paris Peace Conference and was very frustrated that it could not control the conference, so it wanted to use the issue to make a fuss; first, it used the border conflict between Greece and Albania to launch a major attack on the British troops stationed in Greece; but when it came to the Security Council, the Soviet representative Gromyko could not succeed alone, and failed to exert the diplomatic offensive it had adopted; so it changed its direction and used the China issue to launch an offensive against the United States. The main points of his proposal are: (1) The presence of US troops in China has created a situation that is enough to cause international friction; (2) US troops are currently interfering in the internal affairs of China, Iceland, and Latin American countries; (3) The situation in China is not only related to China and the United States, and the Security Council should pay attention to it.</p>
<p>China is also a permanent member of the Security Council. Only China can solve the China issue. Even if it is necessary to appeal to the Security Council, the Chinese representative can also raise it himself, so why bother Gromyko to overstep his authority? What position will he put China in by raising it like this? Therefore, the Chinese diplomatic authorities immediately stated that the presence of US troops in China was based on China's request and does not endanger peace. US Acting Secretary of State Clayton also made the same statement: the presence of US troops in China has not caused unrest. Therefore, the Soviet Union's proposal was also rejected by the Security Council.</p>
<p>The Greek King Returns to the Country and the Civil War Breaks Out Again</p>
<p>Since the plebiscite in Greece decided to allow the king to return to the country and restore the monarchy, the conflict between the government and the leftists has become uncontrollable. Recently, the Greek civil war has reached a critical juncture; Greek Prime Minister Tsaldaris told the press on the 25th: "The war has been transferred from foreign countries to Greece, and foreign forces want to use the chaotic situation to achieve the purpose of obtaining an outlet to the Aegean Sea." From this, we can know the seriousness of the Greek civil war. Britain also believes that the situation in Greece is unstable and does not want to withdraw its troops back to the country, and has jointly decided with the United States to adopt a firm stance, seemingly not hesitating to be involved in the whirlpool of the Greek civil war, which may make Greece become the second Spain.</p>
<p>But when the situation in Greece was in crisis, King George II suddenly returned to the country to restore the monarchy. The current cabinet has resigned, and the former prime minister will form a new cabinet, which will soon be completed.</p>
<p>The Peace Conference Decides to Step Up Its Work</p>
<p>The Paris Peace Conference is scheduled to end before October 15, and all committees must step up their work. The foreign ministers of the United Kingdom, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union decided on the following ways to speed up the work of the conference: (1) The conference is scheduled to hold a plenary session on October 5 to make decisions on the various issues that have been pending for a long time. Each committee should also report the progress of its work to the conference separately. (2) The conference will hold a plenary session on October 15 at the latest to submit various peace treaties for a vote. (3) The four foreign ministers will meet on October 5 to study the results obtained by the conference: they must complete the various tasks before October 15. (4) By the time the United Nations General Assembly opens, if the work of the Four Foreign Ministers' Conference has not yet been completed, the four foreign ministers should go to New York to continue working during the first few days of the United Nations General Assembly.</p>
<p>Since then, all committees have stepped up their work, but haste makes waste, and the Trieste issue has never been resolved. On the 28th, the Committee on Italy passed the border between Italy and Yugoslavia, and the Yugoslav representative threatened to refuse to sign the peace treaty, and the Soviet Union also supported it, so it is expected that the conference will be difficult to complete its work as scheduled.</p>
<p>The Situation in the Straits Is Becoming Tense Again</p>
<p>The issue of the Turkish Straits once caused a great uproar in the international community, and then gradually subsided; but on September 28, the Soviet Union issued a second note to the Turkish government, requesting that the Soviet Union and Turkey jointly defend the Straits area. Turkey's attitude is still firm as a pipe, and it will never change due to Soviet threats. In order to deal with any eventuality, it is also mobilizing troops there. Therefore, the situation in the Straits has changed, and it has once again become the focus of attention for the world.</p>
<h3>The New Defense Lines of the United States and the Soviet Union Are in the Remote and Cold Arctic Circle</h3>
<p>— United Press International Correspondent Cole New York Special Dispatch Translated by the Newspaper Editorial Office South</p>
<p>The remote and cold Arctic Circle has now become an important defense town for the United States and the Soviet Union. With the emergence of new weapons, long-range bombers departing from bases in the Arctic region can threaten all strategic points in Europe, Asia, and America, which would have been unimaginable to people in the 19th century. Currently, the United States and the Soviet Union are closely watching each other's actions in the Arctic Circle, especially the movements in Alaska and eastern Siberia.</p>
<p>Alaska and the far east of Siberia are only separated by the Bering Strait, and the Kamchatka Peninsula and the Aleutian Islands almost connect the eastern and western hemispheres. Currently, these places are becoming outposts for US and Soviet defense, and huge military installations are being built there.</p>
<p>The Soviet Union Is Actively Building Airports, Highways, and Ports</p>
<p>According to reports from various parties, the following points have been done by the Soviet Union in this area: (1) A large airport has been built in Petropavlovsk, which can accommodate bombers as large as Flying Fortresses. The area is only 490 miles away from Atu Island, the US's foremost outpost; (2) Behind the airport and in the hinterland of the area around the port of Petropavlovsk, acres of land have been cleared and warehouses and barracks have been built; (3) The entrance to Avancha Bay has been dredged to allow large ships to enter; (4) The highway on the west coast of the Kamchatka Peninsula from Bolsheretsk to Petropavlovsk has been improved to make it a military road that can be used in all kinds of weather. In addition, there is also an auxiliary road at the southern end of the peninsula, from Bolsheretsk to Cape Lopatka.</p>
<p>The United States obtained this information, of course, it will not say how it obtained it. But in terms of collecting intelligence, the Soviet Union is not necessarily inactive. Over the island of Attu, Soviet planes can be detected flying four or five days a week. The unofficial statement from the Soviet Union is that it is to observe the weather. This statement sounds very reasonable, because there is almost year-round fog over Attu Island, so it is not easy to see the situation on the ground from the air.</p>
<p>But now there is radar, and the installations on the ground can be measured by radar. For example, Americans rarely see Soviet planes, but they know that planes are indeed flying based on radar signals. The Soviet Union's flight over Attu Island is a one-sided action, because the Soviet Union does not allow American or any other country's planes to fly within 200 miles of Soviet territory.</p>
<p>The Soviet Union has announced that it is conducting experiments in Siberia, which, like most of Alaska, is covered by frost and snow all year round, which is very deep. The Soviet Union is using snow plows to clear the frost and snow. If their experiment is successful, then large areas of wasteland in Siberia can be used for military and commercial purposes.</p>
<p>If this can be done in Siberia, then it can also be done in Alaska. The Arctic Circle Has Become a Major Strategic Town Today</p>
<p>US and Soviet Activities Focus on Both Military and Economic Aspects</p>
<p>The Soviet Union concentrated its efforts on developing Siberia shortly before Japan surrendered. Petropavlovsk has a population of 90,000 and has not been affected by the war. After the United States joined the war against Japan, Washington urged Moscow to make Petropavlovsk the second port in the Far East to prevent Japan from attacking Vladivostok, but the Soviet Union did not express interest at the time. But shortly before Japan surrendered, the Soviet Union made efforts to turn Petropavlovsk into a base, and so far, it can be said that it has achieved great success. Ships come and go, and transportation is frequent. This ice-free port is one of the best ports in the far north.</p>
<p>Washington officials pointed out that these activities of the Soviet Union cannot be viewed solely from a military point of view. War is not just child's play, but to make the country and its people live and prosper. The Soviet Union has repeatedly told the world that it wants to become a major commercial country, and the plans they are carrying out in Siberia also have the purpose of developing this vast and rich land.</p>
<p>The US military admits that the Soviet Union has the right to carry out defense work on its own territory. The actions of the Soviet Union in Siberia are for the same purpose as the actions of the United States in Alaska.</p>
<p>Therefore, the activities of the United States and the Soviet Union in the Arctic region obviously have both military and economic significance.</p>
<p>International Figures</p>
<h3>Stalin Has No Generalship; He Says: "I Am Not Mysterious"</h3>
<p>— Translated from Magazine Digest by Zuo Qi</p>
<p>In the recent international disputes, almost every one of them is related to the Soviet Union. To understand the Soviet Union, we must first understand the person behind the scenes of the Soviet government—Stalin.</p>
<p>In the Soviet Union, which practices Marxist ideals, the strangest contradiction is: Marx believed that history is not created by individual heroes, but entirely by the power of the masses; however, no country worships heroic idols more than the Soviet Union, and no country's citizens regard their leader as so sacred and wielding power as great as Stalin.</p>
<p>Indeed, Stalin controls all the party, government, and military power in the Soviet Union. He possesses the world's most powerful private army. Therefore, like the emperors of ancient times, it is very difficult to see him easily. Even when he invites foreign guests, he often looks down and does not look at the faces of the guests, so the guests naturally find it difficult to see his face clearly. In the years of the war against Germany, he never left the country except for one trip to Tehran. Moreover, he does not often make speeches. Former US President Roosevelt made about two speeches a week, but Stalin made at most two a year.</p>
<p>The brief history of Stalin's rule of the Soviet Union is as follows: In the past, he spent thirty-five years fighting the ruling class and was exiled five times by the Tsar. He spent his entire youth planning revolutionary work. Sure enough, after the October Revolution, the Tsar was overthrown. However, the system of prohibiting freedom of speech and freedom of assembly that existed before the Tsar still exists today. Is this the practice of democracy in the Soviet Union under Stalin's leadership? Also, when Trotsky was exiled by the revolutionary army in 1929, Stalin officially became a first-class figure in the party and the state. Therefore, in order to implement his personal ideas, he used his power to kill many comrades who had lived and died with him in the past, until 1940, when Stalin ended his struggle. In this year, Trotsky was assassinated.</p>
<p>It is said that Stalin has two major desires: to avenge personal grudges and to expand the Soviet Union. The first goal has been achieved, and the second goal has also been successfully achieved in this victory in the war against the Axis powers.</p>
<p>Stalin clearly understands and is familiar with the character of the Germans—weakness and obedience. He once proudly told others:</p>
<p>"During the revolutionary period, I and several German comrades went to the 　Laukenburg station to take a train to a certain place for a secret meeting. However, we were too late. Fortunately, the ticket collector did not notice, and I slipped past the platform. However, several German comrades did not dare to do this. Finally, taking advantage of the chaos, they were pulled over by me. Fortunately, we caught up with the train."</p>
<p>Now, Stalin wants to get rewards on the personality of the Germans. The Germans are not difficult to be fascinated and influenced by Soviet education. Like Prussia, Saxony, Thuringia, part of Mecklenburg—almost half of Germany—are under Soviet control. The fruits of victory are not only these. More than half a dozen small European countries have implemented communism without any revolution. He watched his decades of efforts, and today he has finally reaped the harvest.</p>
<p>Former US War Production Board Director Nelson once visited Stalin. From this, we can see Stalin's attitude towards the United States. At that time, Nelson asked what the Soviet Union needed after the war. Stalin immediately wrote on a piece of paper: 50,000 motor vehicles. It can be seen that the Soviet Union only regards the United States as a source of machinery.</p>
<p>Stalin can be said to have completely realized the ambition that was not fulfilled during the Tsarist era. Once, a reporter said that Stalin was as successful as Peter the Great. He laughed after hearing this. In fact, there is a big difference between them: Peter longed to learn everything from the Europeans; Stalin hoped to educate the Europeans.</p>
<p>Also, once, when a reporter talked about fate, Stalin said: "No, I don't believe in fate. Only the ancient Greeks would believe that our lives are given by God. I am not a mysterious person. If you are curious why I didn't die in the revolution, I can answer you, anyone can sit in this chair and be like me." However, for decades, he has been trying to prevent anyone from seizing this throne.</p>
<p>"I am Lenin's student," he said himself. However, everyone feels that this is just a self-promotion. Look at what a Soviet writer said: "When he dies, we must build a tomb that is even greater than Lenin's."</p>

<h3>Ode to Childlessness</h3>
<p>— Zhang Mingchun</p>
<p>I am approaching forty and still have no children. Some friends feel sorry for me; some bless me. After careful analysis, I feel that people without children are lucky. Please let me explain in detail.</p>
<p>Originally, nature created a huge framework, enticing everyone to enter it. First, it calls you to enjoy the right to marry, and then it calls you to fulfill the obligation to have children. Isn't it a blessing to enjoy the right to marry without the suffering of having children? Many people do not consider their ability to support children. In this era, they end up with a large number of children. When they realize that this burden is too heavy to bear, they try to have abortions and study ineffective methods of birth control, lowering their standard of living. It is already too late. With children, your wife will definitely be distracted and unable to serve you wholeheartedly. That's not all. If you are clean, your gowns will often be soiled; if you like quiet, there will be a crying baby in bed; you don't have to worry about no one practicing calligraphy on your beloved books; your favorite flowers and plants are often uprooted; the children's ill health is even more painful than your own illness; the death of a child will also have the danger of Zixia losing his sight. If you want to live a dissolute life, they are your invisible monitors. In families with children, parents have no freedom of speech.</p>
<p>If you don't have children and he doesn't have children, won't this nation become the second American Indians, facing the danger of being eliminated? There is no need to worry about this. There are those who are lost and refuse to return who will be responsible for it, believing that "there are three unfilial acts, and having no descendants is the greatest."</p>
<p>The promoters of encouraging childbirth are almost all power-hungry ambition-mongers. The fascists of Japan, Germany, and Italy deprived the people of all rights and freedoms. Why do they only like you to have sons? Why did Hitler force others to have children, but he himself only married at the time of his death? Today, if there are still some heroes who encourage widows to have children, virgins to have children, and force nuns to marry, don't you understand their intentions?</p>
<p>Without sons, won't people laugh at you for being immoral? Don't worry, don't worry. Chen Tuan's "Heart Physiognomy" clearly states: "Fairness and integrity, even without offspring, will become gods after death." Therefore, people without sons can still become Bodhisattvas. The number of people killed and injured in World War II was nearly 100 million. If arranged in a single line, they could circle the earth four times. Who are they not someone else's good sons? Therefore, according to modern views, it should be: "Those who accumulate virtue have no sons."</p>
<p>Looking closely at the great figures of ancient and modern times, few have many children. How many sons did Sakyamuni, Jesus, Moses, and Muhammad have? Confucius only had a single son who died young. I can't say who Mencius's son was. Guan Yu and Yue Fei both had no direct sons. As for Chinese and foreign heroes, martyrs, scholars, and recluses, such as Wen Tianxiang, Shi Kefa, Gu Yanwu, Zheng Suonan, Lin Hejing, Kant, Descartes... (I won't list more modern celebrities) Where are their sons?</p>
<p>If people really want to laugh at you for having no descendants, you can resist with one sentence: "A bad melon has many seeds." The world's first-class plants and animals are very difficult to preserve their seeds. For example, phoenixes are rare, but sparrows are the most; unicorns are rare, but rats are the most; lingzhi is rare, but weeds are the most; by analogy, sweet springs are rare, but seawater is the most; gold and jade are rare, but mud is the most... Childless people can take this as self-comfort.</p>
<p>"Raising children to prevent old age" is even more of a dream. He can't even be filial to his own wife, will he support you?</p>
<p>"Making a name to honor your parents," don't you want to make a name for yourself through your son? This is even more absurd. I only see sons making a name for themselves, because we only know the sons of celebrities, and we don't know much about their fathers.</p>
<p>However, I also admire the words of someone I don't know: "Sons are like eyebrows. They are of little use if you have them, but they attract attention if you don't have them." That's all.</p>
<h3>Autumn</h3>
<p>— Lao Dan</p>
<p>Time flies like a shuttle. Summer has drifted away like light smoke. Time does not stop. How ruthless it is! No wonder human life is also so fleeting.</p>
<p>The long summer has passed. Now it is again the season of the west wind and withered chrysanthemums. Morning and evening bring a bit of chill. The light clouds in the sky and the fallen leaves in front of the steps fully report that autumn has arrived. The golden wind is refreshing, and the osmanthus is fragrant. How can one not believe that it is late autumn?</p>
<p>Autumn heart is sorrow. When the autumn wind blows bleakly across your face, it gives you a hint as if telling you to regret the easily passing time. Once time passes, it is permanently irreversible. Often a few yellow leaves fall from the tree, sometimes even hitting your body, which may make you feel that your own life is also like them, withering and fleeting. In the evening, the suburbs, lawns, roadsides, intermittently emit a few faint insect chirps. Listening to them, how can you not recall the croaking of frogs in the countryside and fields. In short, all the phenomena of autumn give people endless disappointment and memories, especially what is most easily touched is the melancholy of wanderers who are far away from their hometowns, thinking of their relatives and friends.</p>
<p>Autumn, I am really a little afraid. I am afraid that she will bring a lot of sorrow to people, causing them to constantly yearn for the past, and at the same time be at a loss for the vague future. Although recollection may be of considerable significance, and the future may be bright, in the course of life, it is like bubbles and ephemerals. Then, the changes in human affairs, all the transformations, who can guarantee them?</p>
<p>Some people say that the joy and sorrow of life all stem from each person's own mind. Therefore, everything is determined by the mind. This sentence is very roundabout. But why do most people insist on making trouble for themselves and cannot create a happy and fulfilling life as they wish? I think he will answer you like this: "Easier said than done"?</p>
<p>"The autumn wind whispers, the cold cicada clings to the tree without a sound; the night moon is desolate, the sorrowful geese are startled by the frost and speak alone. The world has no public opinion, who knows the gender of birds? People have a sense of caution, and no one knows the morning or evening of life"! Under the confluence of thousands of emotions, I can't help but recall a few parallel prose sentences from a certain gentleman, and the more I savor them, the more I feel that they are timely words with deep meaning. Taking advantage of this slight breeze and the not-too-cold weather, I write a few sentences to express my feelings a little, perhaps because I have been influenced by the autumn atmosphere.</p>
<h3>On Children's Literature Works</h3>
<p>— Lu Shaoqing</p>
<p>Creating children's literature is a thankless task. However, the creation of children's literature has an important position in the educational cultivation of the younger generation. Gorky wrote "Russian Fairy Tales," and Mr. Lu Xun translated many children's literature works, such as "　" and "Pink　". These world-renowned writers all attached great importance to children's literature. Especially Mr. Lu Xun, seeing the Chinese children's reading materials that were still in the era of poisonous serial picture books, could not help but shout loudly: "Save the children!" This sentence has become a warning to writers in the country. However, more than ten years later, has there been much progress in Chinese children's reading materials? How many excellent children's literature works have been produced? The answer to this question is still chilling.</p>
<p>But the only thing that can comfort us is that there are still some writers who are unwilling to sit idly by and watch China's innocent young people delve into the serial picture books of immortals and swordsmen. They have picked up their pens and are trying to create new types of children's literature.</p>
<p>So we read Zhang Tianyi's fairy tales, He Yi's fairy tales, and Fan Quan's fairy tales.</p>
<p>Regarding Mr. Fan Quan's fairy tales, I have only read two single-printed books and two short stories. The single-printed books are the created "Haba Kingdom" and the translated "Black and White Record." The short stories are "Happiness" and "The Stone Mill That Likes to Sing," which are continuously published in the semi-monthly magazine "Juvenile World."</p>
<p>"Black and White Record" is a translated full-length fairy tale, originally written by the Korean writer Zhang Hezhou, and based on Chinese and Mongolian legends. The content of the whole book writes about two distinctly different personalities: Black Treasure and White Treasure, two brothers. I don't understand Japanese, so I can't compare the translation with the original. However, judging from the translator's writing style, we can't tell that this is a translation. The translator is very good at understanding the psychology of children, and the organization of the sentences matches the children's reading ability and reading interest. In addition, with Mr. Chen Yanqiao's clear and powerful illustrations, this is a children's literature work that has been difficult to see in recent years.</p>
<p>But what surprised me even more was his creative fairy tale "Haba Kingdom." "Haba Kingdom" is a realistic work. From the beginning to the end of the work, the author tightly grasps the psychology of children and completely uses the tone of children to set off the entire story. The story uses the big nose of the King of Haba Kingdom as the key to the story and the engine for developing the story. The carved characters are also very prominent, giving readers a deep impression. The author uses a humorous style and very ridiculous statements to describe very serious events and very realistic stories. The narration of the whole book can be said to be coherent and extremely tense, capturing the scene of the struggle everywhere, making people feel more and more interested and wanting to read the whole book quickly. Therefore, whether in terms of theme or expression, this work is successful.</p>
<p>Mr. Fan Quan's children's literature creation can be summarized into several characteristics.</p>
<p>First, the reality of the subject matter. This can be seen from the two creative fairy tales "Haba Kingdom" and "Happiness." The author does not want children to roam "wonderland" like Amos. The author does not want children to be isolated from reality. On the contrary, he wants to bring "reality" to children, so that children also know the good and evil, the truth and falsehood, the lovable and the hateful of this world.</p>
<p>Second, grasp the psychology of children. This is the basic condition for the creation of children's literature. Whether a work belongs to children or adults is distinguished here. And to bring "reality" to children, if it is only written in the tone of adults, children will not accept it. Mr. Fan Quan is very considerate of this point in his expression techniques, which is where he succeeds.</p>
<p>Third, rich in educational meaning. Originally, the creation of children's literature is to instill new knowledge in children and inspire new ideas in children. "Haba Kingdom" and "Happiness" both contain rich realistic knowledge, but this knowledge is not dogma, but a literary form purely expressed using an inspirational educational method, which is also worthy of our praise.</p>
<p>But here, I must also point out two potentially dangerous tendencies: First, humor that tends towards meaningless farce. This is a road that must never be taken. Zhang Tianyi's works also almost have this terrible trend. Second, the structure of the sentences is too far-fetched and clever, because children are full of imitation. If they imitate such sentences in their writing class, wouldn't it be a big joke?</p>
<p>But in the present era when children's literature works are as rare as the stars at dawn, and when serial picture books of immortals and swordsmen flood the streets, I want to recommend Mr. Fan Quan's children's literature works to adults and children who are currently concerned about children's literature!</p>
<h3>Continued Notes on the Exhibition of Calligraphy and Painting of Past Dynasties</h3>
<p>— Dingshan</p>
<p>The painting exhibition started on the 29th, and all the exhibits were replaced. Cong Yu's "Chu Suiliang Post" was not exhibited, but Wang Shimin and Wang Yuanqi's two scrolls, Wu Li's "Looking at Pines After Rain," and Shi Tao's "Lotus Flowers" were all not listed in the catalog. Wu Li's scroll, the color of the paper is so new, it is like a treasure that has been treasured for three hundred years and has never been displayed. It is a real masterpiece! Shi Tao's "Lotus Flowers" has such strange coloring and composition that no one but Shi Tao can do it.</p>
<p>Pang Yuanji's "Summer Mountain Residence" by Wang Meng is again the top sight of the whole field. This old man's collection is unmatched outside the Forbidden City. With these two works being the crown of the entire exhibition, I have no doubts.</p>
<p>Sun Bozhu's Wang Shimin and Wang Jian calligraphy are also masterpieces, and they are also not listed in the catalog. Wang Shimin's early work is very similar to Dong Qichang, but it has a kind of majestic air that Dong Qichang does not have.</p>
<p>Xu Bangda's Sima Guang scroll has a title by Yang Weizhen, which can be paired with the previously exhibited Lianzhou scroll. I have seen many Sima Guang scrolls, and Xu's scroll and Wu Zishen's scroll are the best. The exhibits that Wu Zishen promised this time have not arrived; is Wu Zishen lazy and enjoying himself alone?</p>
<p>Zhao Mengfu's axis by Wu Hufan and Ma Yuan's axis by Tan Heling have not arrived. What I said in my previous record about being able to imitate is just a matter of course. A smile!</p>
<p>I once wanted to list Dong Qichang, Xiang Shengmo, Wang Shimin, and Yuan Zhao as the four masters of the late Ming Dynasty, and separately list Wang Yuanqi, Wang Hui, Wu Li, and Yun Shouping as the four masters of the Qing Dynasty; some people think it is not satisfactory. Now, after seeing Xiang Shengmo's "Calamus" painting exhibited by Yang Weizhen, it is truly divine. How can Dong and Wang compare?</p>
<p>Qian Jingtang's "Ma Xianglan's Letters to Wang Bogu" contains more than ten letters, with feelings that are so entangled that one wants to die, and the calligraphy is so delicate that it penetrates the bone. It is the most beautiful thing in the whole field.</p>
<h3>Lonely Window</h3>
<p>— Su Shan</p>
<p>The window brings to my small room such secluded brilliance. A delicate pattern composes my many years of boudoir dreams.</p>
<p>I didn't know what loneliness was before, but since someone left a shadow in my heart, I have had loneliness and too deep a sense of desolation.</p>
<p>Slender bamboos decorate the window sill, decorate my lonely heart, and even more decorate my midsummer night's dream.</p>
<p>From late autumn to severe winter, severe winter brings dawn again. My lonely window always reflects the south-bound swallows, south-bound and returning north, and maple leaves dye the window edge, but they are washed by the winter snow and frost again and again. The bright moon in August immerses the window and people in the Milky Way, soaking my lonely heart. Occasionally, a small bird passes by, but it flutters away in a hurry, unable to take away the loneliness.</p>
<p>"The green lamp illuminates the wall, and the person is just falling asleep; the cold rain knocks on the window, and the quilt is not warm." Lonely people, after all, are just "Summer day is clear and does not end late, winter lamp is frozen and the night is long!" From then on, I experience the hesitation of leaving dreams and the flying of farewell intentions. A shadow is imprinted in the bottom of my heart, but it is always just loneliness. Loneliness·Loneliness.</p>
<h3>Get More Familiar with Forms</h3>
<p>— Lü Su</p>
<p>Lu Xun's profound and pungent satire and criticism of society completely relied on the form of his essays to develop and complete. Mayakovsky's futurist poetry form expressed his unrestrained and agitated emotions. Alexandre Dumas fils wrote "La Dame aux Camélias," first as a novel and then as a play. These two different forms of narrating the details of the story in sequence gave it depth. "The True Story of Ah Q" narrates Ah Q's spiritual victory by means of the author's wonderful psychological depiction method, but the play adapted by Tian Han and Xu Xingzhi, etc., needs to borrow other characters on the stage to describe him, which is inevitably a failure. This proves the inseparability of form and content.</p>
<p>The relationship between form and content is so great that writers must use multiple forms to express content. It is certainly good for a writer to be particularly good at and familiar with a certain form, but if they can be familiar with multiple forms, there will be many good subjects that will not slip through the writer's hands, nor will the content be greatly diminished due to the hard stuffing of the form.</p>

<h3>An Inch of Land, An Inch of Blood 50</h3>
<p>— Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>Arriving at Mr. W's headquarters in the ×× Hotel, I saw that Dingyuan was somewhat fatigued, so I advised him to stay in the car and that I could thank Mr. W on his behalf. Yuan agreed. As soon as I stepped into Mr. W's room, Mr. W was holding the secret telephone receiver. When he saw me enter, he immediately put down the phone, his expression already changed, but his demeanor remained calm.</p>
<p>"I'm sorry!" he said very cautiously. "I just called to invite you over, originally to tell you some bad news—Miss Ji Yaoqun and Hucheng, the Tongzhou affair was going smoothly, but this morning around six o'clock, we suddenly received a secret report from there saying that the two of them had suddenly disappeared. First Hucheng, then Yaoqun also disappeared... I have already sent several capable comrades there, specifically for this matter..."</p>
<p>"I understand!" My heart started to panic, and I didn't want to hear anything else. I was about to tell him that after I sent Dingyuan back to Changxindian, I would rush to Tongzhou overnight.</p>
<p>Mr. W waved his hand, "There's more!" He seemed a little breathless, "Just after I called you, your department in Changxindian suddenly called..."</p>
<p>"What happened?" I felt another shock, a little scared, and my heart started pounding uncontrollably.</p>
<p>"I forwarded it, asking you to rush back quickly..." Mr. W said, "I asked him what important matter it was. On the phone, he only said, 'It's no good, the brothers seem to be fully mobilized, the power plant is on fire, there's a big change...' He said he was a communications officer, and the person in charge had already gone out to command. When I asked again, the phone had already been cut off... I've been calling here, calling until now..." Mr. W explained the terrible news in one breath.</p>
<p>Before he finished speaking, I jumped over, and as I reached out, he knew I wanted to try his secret phone, so he picked up the receiver he had just used and handed it to me. While I was calling, I gestured for him to try the secret telegraph. Their equipment was a bit old, with the phone and cipher separated into two parts, which could be transmitted simultaneously. We called at the same time, calling for a long time, but there was no response from the station. Knowing there was no hope, I put down the receiver and prepared to leave.</p>
<p>"Wait!" Mr. W also stopped sending the telegram, "There are two more things. Just now, we received battlefield intelligence. The news is very bad. Zhao Dengyu, the commander of the 132nd Division in Nanyuan, has been killed in action. Tong Linge, the deputy commander of the 29th Army on the outer perimeter, has been seriously wounded. Judging by the tone of the intelligence, it seems his life is in danger. We don't have exact information yet. In Wanping, the Japanese devils have reinforced their counterattack, and our side is also at a disadvantage... I have already sent several comrades and a driver with four submachine guns, divided into three cars, to go with you... Perhaps!"</p>
<p>I just raised my hand and said, "Okay, thank you!" and hurried away.</p>
<p>I got in the car, and our four cars started together. At this time, the two guards in my car had been replaced by two others, probably Mr. W's men. There was also a submachine gun and a small box of ammunition in the car. The driver was also not the original attendant. All of this was probably arranged by Mr. W, and I felt both grateful and admired. In the car, I didn't dare to say anything to Dingyuan, just mumbled a few words. Anyway, he was very tired, huddled in the corner of the car, seeming to be falling asleep. This was a reaction to his over-excitement.</p>
<p>The driver seemed to have received orders, knowing that the destination of this trip was Changxindian, so he went straight west out of the West Gate, without needing me to direct him. Not far outside the city, he waved his hand, telling the cars behind us to come forward. Our car fell behind, inserted into the third position, so that our position was more thoroughly protected. It was just after four o'clock, and the sounds of gunfire and cannons from the battlefield in the suburbs were very clear. When the car was about to reach Tiancun, we suddenly heard the roar of heavy machine guns in a forest in front of us. The car leading the way immediately swerved towards the side of the road, towards several large trees. Our car, of course, followed closely. Arriving under the largest tree, all four cars found suitable spots and stopped one after another. We saw two comrades from the first car, along with the driver, all jump out. A young man, acting like a captain, shouted loudly, "Everyone get out of the car! Find cover!" He ran in front of us and gave us a military salute, "Please get out of the car, gentlemen; Japanese planes are coming!"</p>
<h3>New World Symphony</h3>
<p>— Zhu Lixing</p>
<p>In commemoration of the great Bohemian composer Antonin Dvorak (1841-1904), concerning his Symphony No. 5 in E minor.</p>
<p>On the morning of October 17, 1920, amidst heavy fog, the London Sir Hamilton Harty &amp; Halle Symphony Orchestra performed for the first time this carefully constructed "New World" Symphony No. 5 in E minor (Humoresque Symphonie en mi Mineur, Opus—95) by one of the greatest composers of the Slavic people at the Scala Theatre, not far from Westminster Abbey. Because it was a rehearsal, there were few people in the audience. However, after seventy-five minutes of slow performance, the few people in the audience were unexpectedly packed, and even the wide aisles were crowded with people. The Scala Theatre was simply packed tightly. These guests were unexpected visitors, but everyone was well-behaved and listened quietly. After the performance, everyone walked out of the theater with applause, smiling at each other, and everyone was happy.</p>
<p>Because this time Dvorak's symphony was introduced to Western Europe, countries in Central Europe such as Switzerland began to gradually pay attention to Slavic composers, study them, and become interested in them. For example, the works of the great Russian composer Peter Ilyich Tchaikovsky (1840-1893) were previously not well understood by Western Europe, or even Central Europe. Dvorak was originally from Bohemia, so his works inevitably caused a sense of distance. In fact, a nation has its own characteristics, but the works of the Germanic peoples are relatively easy for people to accept. If it were not for the brilliant structure of Dvorak's "New World" Symphony, perhaps the artistic position of Slavic composers would still be separate and divergent.</p>
<p>Tchaikovsky was one year older than Dvorak, and Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov (1844-1908) was three years younger than Dvorak. The contributions of these three great composers who represent the Slavic people in the arts have added a lot of collaborative spirit among various nations in the arts. Because of this, music has never experienced division to this day. It is completely unified for a hundred years. In the ethnic characteristics, compared with Tchaikovsky's works, the most obvious and authentic Eastern European style is harsh to the ear, while Rimsky-Korsakov is far less stubborn and conservative. However, on the other hand, Tchaikovsky also succeeded because he made his nationality authentic. Between the two, Dvorak is the most moderate genius. This "New World" Symphony, from depicting "Dawn" (Aurore), followed by the "Nostalgia" A ogio to the final "Rapid Fantasy" section, fully developed in the 19th century the natural development of art in the three regions of East, Central and Western Europe as the structure of metallurgy and iron casting. In addition to complete success, it must be said to be the fate between the two great nations. No wonder people with music theory knowledge inevitably have all sorts of reveries when they listen to this "New World".</p>
<p>In Richard Strauss's notes, it was recorded that Dvorak's "New World" Symphony evolved from his own work: "E" Major Quartet (Quinttelo en mi Majer Opus-22), but the level of this quartet is far higher than "New World", which inevitably leads to some speculation. The reason is that this "New World" Symphony is certainly successful in terms of technology, but in terms of level, it is far inferior to his own—Dvorak—quartet. Later generations unanimously recognized that since Franz Schubert, he is the first person to devote his efforts to constructing profound quartets. After the four great composers Bach, Mozart, Beethoven, and Schubert, he is the best. He would never have evolved the naming of the "New World" from studying the insights left by the great Germanic composers, and he would not have created this "New World" after making the "New World" so profound that it was difficult for people to understand. Strauss really overestimated it - the "New World" Symphony.</p>
<p>The English name of the "New World" Symphony is: Symphony No. 5 "New World" in E Minor. Opus 95. It is listed as the ninety-fifth piece in Dvorak's life's work.</p>

<h3>Mumbled Words by the Dim Lamp</h3>
<p>— Shaofu</p>
<p>Daylight saving time has ended, and the original time has been restored. The clocks have been turned back one hour. Therefore, we spent two twelves o'clock last night. Because of the one-hour backward movement, we are confused about the time, making us dizzy!</p>
<p>There are appointments with two friends. They all use the old time, and I use the new time, which makes everyone complain. Things like this are bound to happen a lot in the next two days.</p>
<p>It is said that the Public Utilities Bureau has banned the use of neon lights outdoors since yesterday.</p>
<p>In fact, everything is the same. The red is still red, the green is still green, and the eye-catching is still blinking. I know that I'm afraid I'll have to waste a lot of words on this!</p>
<p>From a aesthetic point of view, if the city loses its neon lights, it will not be a city.</p>
<p>They are shouting about suppressing commodity prices again. Shanghai people seem to be numb and are not interested in this. Anyway, prices are always rising, so let them rise! As for talking about suppressing, let you suppress it! Suppression will not level things out, at most it will not rise much.</p>
<p>What is the reason for the formation of this mentality, it is too sad to think about!</p>
<p>A single passenger encountered a robbery in the suburban villa. A robbery in broad daylight happened on the Beijing-Shanghai line, and the problem is not simple. Some people say this is "he who enters through dishonesty, departs through dishonesty," and others say, "the poorer you are, the more unlucky you become."</p>
<h3>The Inside Story of Comic Strips</h3>
<p>— Huang Jieqing</p>
<p>Comic strips, which have penetrated into the masses, are a powerful tool for imparting knowledge; the tool itself does not need to bear the merits and demerits of society, the problem is only in its content, how to guide it into the right track, so as not to become a poison to the minds of women and children.</p>
<p>Theory is not the focus of this article, I only provide some facts about comic books:</p>
<p>Appeared as early as the late Qing Dynasty</p>
<p>Comic strips appeared as early as the late Qing Dynasty. At first, they were printed using woodblocks, the printing was poor, and the content was mostly absurd and bizarre, focusing on low-level tastes, and not suitable for polite society. By the early years of the Republic of China, lead printing was used, and the editing and drawing techniques gradually improved, but the collection of materials still did not depart from gods, monsters, and pornography. When there were sensational social cases, no matter how unethical or immoral, they were mostly recorded as content, and they were embellished to numb the nerves of the general public with shallow knowledge and little knowledge.</p>
<p>It was not until around the 20th year of the Republic of China that movie scripts began to be used as subjects, from "Breaking the Golden Light Formation", "Burning the Red Lotus Temple", "Lion Head Strange Hero" ... and other divine and strange romances, to "Fisherman's Light Song", "The Lost Lamb", "Little Angel", "慈母曲" ... and other social ethics stories.</p>
<p>The continuous change in the content of comic strips is a reflection of social trends and the trend of the times. Publishers must cater to the psychology of readers in order to do business. "Sharp eyes and sensitive minds" are necessary conditions. Since the War of Resistance Against Japan, more than a hundred kinds of comic strips about military affairs, science, education, and resistance to the enemy have appeared. Although it cannot be said to be meritorious, perhaps it can "atone for sins" and slightly offset the faults of the past.</p>
<p>Eating from Comic Strips</p>
<p>There are about ten "comic strip" bookstores in Shanghai, with "Yadong", "Global", "Rixin", "Wende", "Qizhi", and "Youwen" publishing the most books. These publishers either sell the copyright to the editors and artists, or pay monthly salaries. If the sales are brisk after the book is published, there will be extra bonuses. The treatment is not bad, so there are those who take this as a lifelong career.</p>
<p>The sales of comic books have always been mainly in inland counties, cities and towns. In addition, they are wholesale to book stalls and vendors in the city at a 40% discount. According to the statistics of the 26th, there are more than 4,000 "comic strip rental stalls" in the city, from bustling streets to remote alleys, there are traces of them. The current rental price of each book (about 20 to 24 pamphlets) is 200 yuan. As long as it is rented out six times, the cost can be recovered. If you are frugal, a book stall can support a family of four.</p>
<p>Handling by the Authorities</p>
<p>Currently, the published comic books must first be inspected and reviewed by the Book, Newspaper, Film and Drama Section of the Welfare Culture Department of the Social Affairs Bureau, and can only be printed and distributed after approval. In order to review the book, the content must not involve any evil thoughts, and even errors in punctuation marks must be corrected before submitting for review again. Therefore, bad comic strips have gradually been eliminated, so as not to become harmful reading materials for society. I hope the authorities can take further action.</p>
<h3>Ostrich Gentlemen</h3>
<p>— Guizhou</p>
<p>Before the outbreak of the Pacific War, some pure "Hong Kong people" were ridiculed as "ostriches" because they were "not very concerned" about the War of Resistance Against Japan. Regardless of whether Hong Kong people should be called "ostriches", the fact that the situation in Hong Kong is different from other parts of the country is an undeniable fact. This is because Hong Kong has been ruled by the British, who are good at "governing", for more than a hundred years. There are so-called "Chinese gentlemen" or "higher Chinese" in Hong Kong. The Hong Kong government is quite "polite" to these gentlemen, and consults with them on matters concerning the Chinese, and they must "consult" them when they want money and effort. When the amount of money and effort they put in is considerable, the order is directly sent from London for commendation, or to be made a "爵士." The title of "爵士" is amazing in Hong Kong!</p>
<p>However, sometimes the British will put on airs. In 1939, the British were building a school, and a certain "Chinese gentleman", in order to ingratiate himself, voluntarily donated a huge sum of money. After the school was completed, he wanted to send his young master to school, but the British refused politely, saying that this school was exclusively for British children. If your son wants to study, please go to another school!</p>
<p>In a place ruled by foreigners, even if you can get temporary "favor," the spirit is still painful.</p>
<p>At present, there should be no more ostriches!</p>
<h3>The Fattest Man in the World:</h3>

Seven weaklings like us, who weigh about a hundred pounds, are not as good as one of him. The pair of pants he is wearing has . He wears size eleven canvas shoes, because leather shoes are extremely uncomfortable for him.</p>

<p>In these many names mentioned above, in fact mile...inch and 哩...吋 and kilometer...centimeter and 基羅米達...生的米達 are each the same length. If the speaker or writer is a little careful, it can make the uneducated general public clear at a glance and not get it wrong. Now that the government has stipulated the adoption of the 市制, then the old 里, 尺, Tianping scale, 石, 畝...etc. can be abandoned; although in practical use it may be difficult to correct at one time, but in writing, you can convert them, as a way to advocate.</p>
<p>In the same record, two or even more unit names are often used. For example, acres are written, then , and then are used, and then square miles are used. It should be known that the area of mu, , and are are not small numbers, so that even if it is the same number, the reader cannot get an accurate concept for a while. From comparison, people who do not know the mutual relationship between mu, , are, and square miles are even more confused.</p>
<p>What is even more ridiculous is that when recording the area, distance, quantity, etc. of our country, instead of using the national system, the metric system is used, and even more people use the English system or other unit names, such as Shanghai to Hangzhou is about a hundred miles...etc., just like Rong Desheng's kidnapping case, the ransom must be calculated in US dollars instead of 法幣. Therefore, some people will mark domestic goods with US dollars and appear in the domestic market!</p>
<p>Some people read 3, 4175, 9862 as three hundred forty-one million seven hundred fifty-nine thousand eight hundred sixty-two, but there are more people who still read it as three ten thousand ten thousand four hundred seventeen million five hundred ninety-eight hundred sixty-two. (This number should be written as 3, 0000, 4175, 9862)</p>
<p>Now the Legislative Yuan has passed the standard law, I hope that in the future it can gradually become standard!</p>
<h3>Leftover After Editing</h3>
<p>— Jingcao</p>
<p>1. Checking Tickets</p>
<p>Ticket checker: "Why didn't you buy a ticket? Which department are you from? No! If you don't buy a ticket! Get off the bus!"</p>
<p>Soldier: "I am an officer after being discharged from the surplus staff, because I have no money, so I had to take a free ride once. I'm sorry, please forgive me a little bit!"</p>
<p>Ticket checker: "No money, who believes it?" (Urging a military police officer next to him) "Please check him to see if he has any money."</p>
<p>Military police officer: (Turns over the things taken out of the soldier's bag, counting and reciting) "A soldier's manual, a discharge certificate, a wound badge, sixty points in postage stamps, two pieces of draft paper, a needle, and thirty-five yuan in 法幣. That's it!"</p>
<p>Ticket checker: "Really..." Gave the soldier a blank look.</p>
<p>2. Inspection</p>
<p>Military police officer: "Comrade, may I ask which unit are you from?"</p>
<p>Soldier: "Surplus staff officer."</p>
<p>Military police officer: "Since you are discharged from the surplus staff, you should wear plain clothes, and there are no badges or symbols."</p>
<p>Soldier: "I don't have money to buy plain clothes."</p>
<p>Military police officer: "No, you have to come to the team with me, there is nothing to say."</p>
<p>Soldier: "Okay." (Thinking in his heart: I haven't eaten anything for two meals, I have to give me food when I go to their troops.)</p>
<h3>Divorce in America</h3>
<p>— George</p>
<p>Divorce in the eyes of Americans is not a tragedy, but a game.</p>
<p>According to official American statistics in September of this year: the total number of marriages last year was 1,618,331 couples, and 31% have declared divorce. On average, one out of every three new families established last year has broken up.</p>
<p>In 1930, there were only 192,000 divorce cases nationwide in the United States, and in 1940, the number had increased to 264,000.</p>
<p>In 1938, there were a total of 400,000 people who got married in the United Kingdom, but there were also as many as 24,000 people who got divorced in that year. The ratio of divorce to marriage in the UK is 1 to 17. From January 1 to August 20 this year, there have been 17,500 divorce cases in the UK—that is, 35,000 people. There are an average of about 20,000 divorce cases in France each year.</p>
<h3>Birth Figures</h3>
<p>The United States has 2.15 million people each year, Japan has 2.19 million people, and Germany has 1.27 million children. The United Kingdom has 600,000 people, and France has 630,000 people.</p>
<p>France is not only lagging behind in population birth rate, but also lost 3 million strong men in the two world wars, resulting in a phenomenon where there are more women than men - a ratio of about 109 to 100. Therefore, France established the "French Ministry of Population" a few years ago, and recently the Ministry has drafted a plan to encourage childbirth. Every married couple can get a loan of 80,000 to 100,000 法郎, to be repaid in installments over ten years, and for each child born, a deduction of 20,000 法郎 can be made. If there are five children in one birth, then this debt can be cleared with one stroke.</p>
<p>After all, France is a civilized country, unlike Germany under Hitler's rule, which forced monks to break the precepts and nuns to become public prostitutes in order to "encourage" childbirth.</p>
<h3>Low Profile</h3>
<p>— Ge Zhensheng</p>
<p>The Communist military leader He Long inadvertently revealed the Communist Party's "progress": He pointed to the "Liberated Areas" and said, "Nine hundred dan of grain rotted in the grain bureau at once... Financial and commercial institutions become corrupt, embezzling tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands (of 'border currency,' of course!)... The chief of the materials section of the Ministry of Health, the things he alone embezzled were enough for his wife, children, nanny, and others to squander for seven years!" No wonder the pro-Communist American journalist Mr. Fairbank also said: The "situation" after the Communists came to power is unknowable.</p>
<p>The state is like a pregnant woman, and the materials received should be like the fetus in the womb. And the officials receiving (the materials) are actually just like midwives. If the materials rot or are looted, it's no different from the midwife committing a heinous act, cutting off a piece of flesh from the mother's womb—truly, piece after piece, slice after slice—truly bloody and tearful—Do you think this fetus is still useful? And how much suffering does this pregnant woman endure?</p>
<p>The destruction or bombing of transportation is similar to "looting." Let me give an example right before our eyes: a train near Chengde, Rehe, was bombed in a tunnel, and there was no way to deal with it, so they had to use hydrogen flames to melt it and then take out pieces, one piece at a time. Such things cannot be repaired, and it is too expensive to repair them. Alas, the little life is lost, and even the mother's body is almost gone. I send a message to those who destroy transportation, please imagine the indescribable pain of this pregnant woman, our country!</p>
<p>If daughters are cheap, are men worth any more? With the ban on dancing, it is said that dance hostesses have already entered the "fire pit" from the dance halls, changing their waists for "pillow recommendations," and this is what is called "changing careers." Now, rickshaws are gradually being banned, and if practical ways to change careers are not considered as soon as possible, the "fire pit" for rickshaw pullers may also be unavoidable, but it is not known where that is.</p>

<h3>Sanmao Joins the Army (112)</h3>
<p>— By Zhang Leping</p>
<h3>The heroine in "Rouge Blood"—Linda Darnell.</h3>
<p>News Figure</p>
<h3>Mr. Wu Tiecheng</h3>
<p>— Jifeng</p>
<p>Recently, the newspapers have frequently carried Mr. Wu Tiecheng's speeches, and not long ago, there were rumors that Mr. Wu would lead the Hebei-Wan region, which made me think of this former mayor who had made great contributions to the history of Shanghai. Undoubtedly, among the past mayors of Shanghai, Mr. Wu left the deepest impression on the people of Shanghai.</p>
<p>When Mr. Wu took office as the mayor of Shanghai on January 7, 1932, just three weeks later, the "January 28th" Incident broke out in Songhu. At this time, the urgency of the situation and the danger of the situation were imaginable to anyone. Most of his subordinates were at a loss, but Mr. Wu went to the government office as usual every day, participated in military affairs (Mr. Wu was originally a soldier), negotiated diplomacy, and worked all night. Later, he also experienced the battles of the Great Wall and Suiyuan-East, as well as the Xi'an Incident. In the city of Shanghai, where Chinese and foreigners lived together and the relationship was complicated, it was most difficult and not easy to please to deal with the special forces of foreigners who were good at instigating incidents, and to deal with the residents of uneven quality. However, from 1932 to 1937, in these five years, Mr. Wu handled them properly, ensuring the safety and happiness of the city's four million residents, and also carefully managed the construction of the city center, which can be said to have achieved both civil and military achievements.</p>
<p>A Socialite</p>
<p>Mr. Wu was very good at socializing. During his tenure as the mayor of Shanghai, he often held tea parties to entertain Chinese and foreign guests. He gladly accepted invitations from community groups to give speeches. Although his eloquence was not very good, his demeanor was extremely dignified and generous when he spoke. He even enjoyed attending the opening of stores and theaters. When the Great New Amusement Park opened in 1936, Mr. Wu said in his speech: "I am not a master. I am willing to participate in everything that is beneficial and meaningful to society."</p>
<p>However, Mr. Wu's social skills were not used to "show off." In 1935, all walks of life in Shanghai, in view of Mr. Wu's great achievements in the local area, initiated the establishment of the "Mayor Wu Memorial Pavilion," but Mr. Wu firmly declined and sent a letter to all walks of life requesting the cancellation of the agreement. March 7, 1937, was Mr. Wu's 50th birthday. Relatives, friends, colleagues, and people from all walks of life were prepared to raise their glasses and celebrate, which scared Mr. Wu into sneaking away to Wuxi on the 7th to avoid the birthday celebration, only gathering with people from the press on the evening of the 6th.</p>
<p>Mr. Wu was tall and strong and advocated sports very much. He himself was also a sports athlete. During his time in Shanghai, he made two major contributions to sports: one was the completion of the sports ground in the city center, and the other was the planning of the National Games held in Shanghai. When the National Games opened, Mr. Wu often kicked off the ball and awarded prizes in the field.</p>
<p>An Old Truck</p>
<p>Mr. Wu was from Zhongshan County, Guangdong Province. He studied in the United States and Japan in his early years. During the Xinhai Revolution, he served as the Deputy Chief of Staff and Commissioner of Foreign Affairs of the Jiujiang Military Government. In 1920, he served as the Commander-in-Chief of the Bandit Suppression Army, and later served as the Military Counselor of the Presidential Palace, the Commander of the Guangdong Provincial Guard Army, the Director of the Guangdong Provincial Police Department and the Director of the Guangzhou Public Security Bureau, and the Commander of the Guangzhou Garrison. In 1931, Zhang Qun resigned from his position as the mayor of Shanghai, and Mr. Wu took over. In 1937, he was transferred to Guangdong, his "first hometown" (Mr. Wu called Shanghai his second hometown). It was during the outbreak of the War of Resistance. Mr. Wu organized the people in Guangdong and promoted the people's spirit with all his strength. In 1939, he resigned as the chairman of the provincial government and took a position in the central government, currently serving as the Secretary-General of the Central Party Headquarters. He came to Shanghai in May of this year. After eight years of anti-Japanese war work, Mr. Wu is not as strong as before, but he told reporters: "This time I came to Shanghai to examine my body, I want to repair this old truck and work with you middle-aged and young people to contribute to the country!"</p>
