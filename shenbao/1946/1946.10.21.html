<h3>各方代表今晨離滬　和談移京繼續舉行　孫院長午宴後交換意見</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨日中共及第三方面各代表，均已作晋京準備，並定今晨八時半，在龍華機塲集合。中共發言人陳家康曾發表談話稱：「自政府於十一日攻佔張家口，同時頒佈國大召開今後，和平談判之門本已關閉，全面破裂險象環生，此時救中國的任務，仍然需要由中國人自己解決，國共之外，各黨派及無黨派代表抱着「死馬當作活馬醫」的精神，爲民主和平，呼號奔走，悲天憫人，可感可泣，談判所以重開。職此之故，過去兩日中在滬舉行之非正式商談，限于交換意見，發現問題，以故並無結論。現在爲事實上方便計，定于二十一日將此種談判移往南京舉行，中國共產黨救瀕于分裂之中國如救垂危之慈母，如有一綫生機，無不竭力以赴，然而成敗利鈍之關鍵，則仍操在政府手中。中共願追隨各黨派代表社會賢達及全國人民之後，一致努力爭取」。</p>
<p>中共方面晋京者，有周恩來氏及隨員八人；第三方面代表，則有青年黨曾琦，陳啓天，左舜生，楊永浚，余家菊，李璜；民主同盟張君勱，羅隆基，沈鈞儒，黃炎培，章伯鈞，蔣勻田；社會賢達胡政之，郭沫若。</p>
<p>記者昨曾分訪若干代表，綜合彼等意見如次：（一）無論如何，「談」總比「不談」好；（二）雙方意見即有距離，然仍有接近可能；（三）若干代表頗關切北平軍事會議之發展，認爲或能影響停戰前途；（四）此次會談，勢將成爲歷次談判中最重要之一次，願竭力使其成功。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕負責照料中共及第三方面代表晋京之中央黨部秘書張壽賢氏，已於昨日飛回上海，據談已包妥中航機一架。中共代表昨已與馬帥接洽派機來滬接往南京，惟至昨晚尚未到達。如馬帥所派飛機于今晨八時前到滬，則中共代表將在江灣機塲起飛；否則與第三方面代表同乘中航機飛京。</p>
<p>〔本報南京二十日電〕政協政府代表吳鐵城，邵力子，二十日上午八時半由滬返抵京，兩氏於十七日銜命赴滬敦促各黨派代表來京，參加商談，經在滬接洽奔走，昨日下午佳音傳抵首都，各方人士均寄以無限熱望，今晨記者七時前即趕赴下關迎接，火車因故誤點一小時許，至八時半，車甫抵站，記者即登最後一列之專用車與辛勞備至之吳邵兩氏見面，邵着長袍馬褂，神色疲憊，首與往迎之政協秘書長雷震及記者等稱，勞你們久等了，記者詢以車上睡眠如何，邵答稱一條被太冷兩條被又熱了，沒有睡好，但一提到和談問題，兩氏均表示極爲愉悅，吳並即於車廂傍對記者發表如次之談話：「留滬各黨派及社會賢達政協代表，二十一日上午即乘專機返京商談一切，至會議方式自然是依照非正式五人小組會議，軍事三人小組會議，憲草審議會，政協綜合小組進行，惟第三方面人士仍建議會外多交換意見，以助會議進行」。</p>
<h3>吳邵報告滬上情形　蔣主席表示欣慰　幷囑代表政府表示歡迎</h3>
<p>旋即下車，八時三刻返寓邸略休息後，即於九時往謁主席報告在滬洽談經過，主席聆報告後甚表欣慰，並囑兩氏代表政府對來京代表表示歡迎，近十時兩氏遄返吳氏私邸，並接見記者，十一時赴孫科寓，向政協政府代表報告一切。計到王世杰·陳布雷·吳鼎昌·陳立夫等，傍晚記者再訪邵氏，邵氏以更愉快之神情稱，吾人此次赴滬，在邀請各方代表返京打開商談僵局，現此項使命已達成，各代表將於廿一日來京繼續進行和談，惟前途不能謂無困難，仍盼各方能尊重國家利益，犧牲各人成見，企達成真正和平團結之目的，並盼大家共同努力。記者詢三人會五人會廿一日是否即可舉行，邵稱，廿一日將首先會外商洽非正式交換意見。中午將由孫科假勵志社邀宴由滬來京及在京之各政協代表等數十人，餐後即進行會外商談，且可能晉謁主席。</p>

<h3>無科學即無國防　蔣主席對中研院評議會訓示兩點　盼迎頭趕上與各國齊驅</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京廿日電〕中央研究院評議會開幕時，蔣主席特頒訓詞全文如下：抗戰其中，該院曾舉行二屆二次評議會，距今已閱二年，世界學術之進展，無一刻之靜止，而國防建設之需要，尤爲迫切。該院在此勝利還都之時，召集三次評議會，實含有深切之意義，中正於此欲向與會諸君告者，厥有二事：自二十六年抗戰初起，該院隨政府西遷，歷盡困苦艱難，院中人士，多能淬厲志節，勤勉工作，而評議會亦曾一度改選，兩次集會，策動一切業務，並對政府有重要之建議，其貞固之樑，忠愛之懷，足爲大林楷則，應向諸君致其嘉慰者此其一。中正常以『無科學即無國防』之義示國人，鑒於此次世界大戰勝負之原因，益可證明科學研究之重要，該院既爲首都唯一之學術研究機關，評有求于會更共負促進國內外學術研究合作互助之使命，今後如何加强我國學術研究工作，尤其對於國際科學上最近之發明，應如何努力探討，以期迎頭趕上，與先進各國並駕齊驅，均有循於諸君之一貫努力，急起直追，應致其殷切之望者，此其二。建國萬端，要以學術爲基礎與會諸君皆爲國內學術專家，集思廣益，深慮熟籌，當必有具體之計劃，以適合時代之需求，任重道遠，當仁人新士，探一溯原，窮理極物之心，得爲經世致用，推陳出新之貢獻，增厚國力，發揚國光，有利賴焉。</p>
<h3>肉彈大刀時期已過去　戰爭決勝於科學　白部長暢論國防科學之重要性</h3>
<p>〔本報建南京二十日電〕白部長崇禧於二十日晨，在中央研究院評議會開幕式席上致詞，暢論國防科學之重要性，盼全國科學家能與國防部合作。白引申蔣主席訓詞：『無科學，等於無國防，等於無國家，』科學之重要，於此可見。國防部有鑒於此，其組織特點之一，即爲重視科學，國防部本身預算百分之二，將用於科學研究。就科學本身論，應以造福人類爲其終極目的，所惜世界曾有若干野心家，利用科學，作其戰爭工具，用以消滅文化。我人重視科學，僅爲自衛性質，並以維護世界和平，在現階段實爲需要。白氏並舉歷關鍵作用戰爭爲例，證明科學進步者，往往能得勝利，而現代戰爭，尤以科學進步程度爲決定，蓋以一時期，實爲科學戰，技術戰，與裝備戰也。抗戰初期，我國所以敗挫者，軍人間應負責，然科學家應負一部份責任，肉彈時期，大刀時期，已成過去，決定勝負者，不繋於人口多寡，而實決於科學優劣。抗戰末期，我得盟邦裝備之助後，即能轉而發動攻勢，轉敗爲勝，即其例證。白氏並堅決之語謂稱：我人不希望將來有戰事發生，但不能不早爲之備。我國科學基礎，素不如人，尤宜迎頭趕上，作超時代之努力。並稱：未來戰爭，爲突發性，毀滅性，全體性者，故平時與戰時不應劃分，不能等動員後，再作戰。白氏談國防部所從事科學研究工作稱：國防部本身現設有若干科學研究機關，並將遣送若干特殊人才赴國外深造，在國際上亦設法與友邦聯繋，羅致外國科學人才，以爲我用。全國海陸空官兵科學知識，亦設法予以利用，惟近數十年來，仰仗於外人者多，而所得者僅爲皮毛，如普法戰爭，普獲勝後，我照普操典直抄，一字不易，槍掮於左肩，迨日本於日俄戰爭中獲勝，我又全部抄襲日本操典，槍掮於右肩，現在左肩右肩掮槍皆已失敗，乃無所適從，足見一味抄襲之非是，盼科學家能與國防部合作一致努力。</p>
<h3>世界科學進步速度驚人　我生存問題已感到威脅　朱家驊之開幕詞</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京廿日電〕中研究評議會開幕式中，朱家驊致開幕詞，略云：中研院今天回到首都來開二屆三次評議會年會，深感歡欣與榮幸，可惜本院的創辦人蔡前院長，也就是本會的前議長在抗戰期間逝世，我們今天不能得到他的領導，道是最大的遺憾，我們於懷念之餘，應該更加努力來達成蔡先生所寄予本院的期望。本院爲全國最高學術機關，在抗戰期間，受敵人的封鎖，國內交通又不便，我們不僅得不到設備的補充地，且與國際合作和聯繋，也極度困難，可以說無法充分盡我們的職責，加之物資的艱苦，一切工作自不能維持經常的進展，可是全國學人不斷的專心研究，全國的學術仍有相當的進步，本院的動植物研究所的分設，數學醫學各研究所的籌設，却都在這期間先後實現，對於高空電離層之研究，且能粗具端倪，這種精神，應該要繼續下去的。不過我們學術研究根基本淺，而戰時世界科學的進步，其驚人速度，更使我們望塵莫及，整個民族的國際地位，乃至生存問題，我們已感到嚴重的威脅，固然國人提倡西洋學術爲時已久，而政府自從奠都南京以後，尤其在抗戰期間，對於科學之提倡，三令五申，成效終是有限，最近國防最高委員會決有求于，以後國家總預算內，科學研究費用佔有百分比，經過此次切實而具體的議決之後，中國科學研究史上，定可以產生一個重要階段了，那末本會歷次會議決議，從此有了實施的機會，這是值得歡喜的。</p>
<h3>建國必賴科學　立國尤重文化</h3>
<p>吳鐵城述邁進途徑</p>
<p>吳秘書長鐵城在評議會中致詞，略稱：稽諸往史，學術文化的進展，不外兩途，一是天才的出現，一是時勢的要求，如批號南針，渾天儀的發明，就是如此，也可知道我國學術文化上有其燦爛光明之歷史。更就當世而言，翁詠霓·竺可楨·華羅庚諸先生在地質·氣象·數學方面，均有優異的成就，爲世界學術界所重視。建國必賴學術，立國尤重文化，吾人乃欲迎頭趕上歐美學術文化，進而建設富强康樂國家，必須向下列途徑，勇往邁進，第一，文化基礎在學術，學術進步在研究，故欲發展文化，必須由中央研究院領導前進。第二，研究學術必須發揚科學精神，運用科學方法，今後如何充實中央研究院以及各級學校的食品圖書，必須共同努力提出具體辦法。第三，研究學術必須有安定環境，使從事於學術的人，得以安心研究，使如何促進國家統一社會和平，不但政治家的責任，也是學術家的責任。第四，研究學術的人，必須生活安定，如使其楊腹從事民族文化工作，實絕不可能，故保障學者的生活，也是迫切問題。</p>
<h3>生活安定才能研究學術　只要十年一定可獲成果　胡適之答詞</h3>
<p>胡適答詞，略云：政府提倡學術研究非常熱心，然而，事實上我們的專家，我們的研究工作者，始終在生活的重担下窒息着，有的因爲營養不足，病在床上，有的忙着替太太抱小孩，倒馬桶，根本談不到學術研究。二三十年以前，美國在學術上毫無地位，到今天這種情形，已經顯着地轉變了，加利福尼亞的工業研究所，成立不過二十年，造就了許多專家，其中好多位都曾得到諾貝爾獎金，普林斯頓的高級研究所，規定得過博士學位的人，才有資格進去研究，裏面收容了當初納粹德國放遂出來的專家，如相對論發明者愛因斯坦等對世界學術都有光榮的貢獻。我從前常常覺得，中國沒有一個有五十年歷史的大學或研究機構，是莫大的遺憾，現在我的看法不同了，歷史和年代並不足以決定一切，倘使政府能使我們的生活安定下來，能有充足的經費，供我們作研究之用，我相信只要十年功夫，一定就可以獲得相當的成果。在中國並不是沒有人材，林可勝先生的醫學，汪敬熙先生的心理學，在安陽從事發掘的幾位先生的考古學，全世界的專家都非常欽佩，我們所需要的是生活的安定，只有在安定的生活裏，才能把全部精力都集中到學術研究上面去。（中研院評議會開幕情形見第八版）</p>

<p>社論</p>
<h3>但願政局從此開朗</h3>
<p>中共代表周恩來等暨第三方面代表，於今日晨光熹微之中，乘坐政府特備專機晋京，恢復停頓已久的和平商談；這是目前國內時局的一大轉捩點，使渴望和平統一的全國老百姓，均感到極大的快慰，而對於國內局勢又燃起一綫希望。</p>
<p>緣自本年六月間政府再度頒佈停戰以來，和平商談未能解決問題，雙方的距離，反而愈談愈遠；戰亂的烽火，亦隨之蔓延擴大，雖經調人馬帥與司徒大使的從中調處，但是雙方又相持在『三』『五』之爭的問題上。直至最近，國軍收復張家口，政府又頒令召集國民大會，中共的態度益中不可理喻，幾使在停頓狀態中的和平商談，有陷於干裂決的危機；全國人民莫不懾於局勢的嚴重，企求和平的願望，益形迫切，政府有鑒於斯，乃採納了其他方面許多意見，由蔣主席於十六日發表關於處理目前時局的文告，重申政府對於國內政治問題始終堅持以政治方式解決的基本態度，並提出八項解決國共問題的具體辦法，獲得了全國一致擁護。第三方面亦認爲時機迫切，不容中共再失此最後良機，乃羣起呼籲，在滬一再勸告周恩來等尅日晋京，恢復商談，並提出『談，停，談』三字爲口號，經過二三天的奔走號呼，彼此交換意見，終於在祥和的空氣中，獲得到了一個結論，決定中共代表周恩來等與第三方面代表，於今日晋京。</p>
<p>本報社論曾一再指出政府重視人民祈求和平以休養生息的願望，故不惜委曲求和，對於催促周氏早日晋京，以恢復商談，也曾作極大的努力，政府代表僕僕風塵，兩次往來於京滬道上，爲的是什麼？還不是爲了要替國家留一綫生機，使人民不再遭受戰亂的痛苦？我們在未聞悉周恩來同意晋京的消息之前，早已預料到政府企求和平的一番至誠，也必能金石爲開了。現在周恩來終算沒有使我們失望，而於今晨乘機晋京了。這固然是第三方面調處的成功。但也是人民公意的勝利。我們料想在今天，任何黨派，終不能公然違背民意吧！</p>
<p>惟周氏的晋京恢復和平商談，僅能視爲目下時局的一個轉捩點，導成和談的重開而已。但是時局能否從此而豁然開朗？當有待國共雙方暨第三方面在和談中努力。最重要的，尤其要從大處着眼，能顧全大局，勿爭小節，所以我們深望中共亦能接受蔣主席所提出的八項要點，作爲和談的基礎。否則恢復和談之後，茫無頭緒，不知何去何從，和談則仍將夜長夢多，恐有重蹈過去覆轍之虞，使我們老百姓再空歡喜一場。</p>
<p>要之，我們對於周恩來等今日晋京恢復和談，都抱着極大的期望；但願政局從此開朗，使我們老百姓所抱的願望，都能實現，今後不僅我們老百姓不再遭受戰亂的浩刧，而且也能看到全國人民代表暨各黨派代表，在下月國父誕辰聚首於一堂，一心一意地制定一部國家的根本大法，使中國的政治早日走上憲政的常軌。</p>
<h3>貝爾納斯的演說</h3>
<p>巴黎和會已首結束，聯合國大會將於本月廿三日在紐約舉行。巴黎和會雖然通過了對義羅芬匈保五國和約草案，但是開會期間，不知多少波瀾，議場上糾紛迭起，進行並不順利，例如特里雅斯特港和多瑙河自由航行問題，因爲南斯拉夫和蘇聯的堅持，至今尚未解決。而其中最使世界不安的現象，誠如美國國務卿貝爾納斯所說，不是五國『和約草案條文，而是美蘇兩國間有增無減的緊張關係。』所以第二次聯合國大會是否能够成功，要看美蘇兩國執政當局是否抱親善的態度而定了。貝爾納斯於十八日晚向美國全國廣播的演說，因此引起全世界的注意。現在演說已經發表，貝爾納斯對蘇的態度，已經沒有從前那樣强硬，連反對他的華萊士也說他『已較在德國斯都伽特城演講時進步了』，這足以證明美國對蘇聯有和平的決心，值得全世界愛好和平人士欣慰的。</p>
<p>貝爾納斯在演說中，首先極力排除新戰爭不可避免的恐懼心理，認爲此種謬論實爲國與國間及一國之內造成緊張局勢之原因。這實在是一針見血之談。自從第二次世界大戰結束以來，第三次世界大戰不可避免之說，甚囂塵上，特別是史達林今年二月九日，宣佈另外一個戰爭不可避免之後，使蘇聯全國上下充滿了恐懼，對內則整軍經武，對外則明爭暗取，擴張其所謂安全地帶。同時美國方面，也逐漸造成恐懼的心理，杜魯門總統宣佈美國現在又面臨到珍珠港事變前同樣的危機。美國對蘇的態度，也日趨强硬，國防的工作也積極進行。</p>
<p>恐懼戰爭的心理固然是一切問題的徴結。然而要消除這種心理，必有待於雙方面的互相讓步。假如一方面讓步，他方面壓迫，固然也可以成立諒解，但是除非在武力絕對優勢之下，是不容易辦到的。貝爾納斯認爲這種諒解，『美國不願出此，美國亦不願他國爲之。每一諒解商在調和異見，而不在一國屈服於另一國之獨斷的意志。』這確實開誠佈公的話。上次華萊士演說，主張對蘇綏靖，曾引起美國內輿論的不滿，終而棄職。此次貝爾納斯的演說，於對蘇態度堅定之中，却表示相當的退讓和容忍，彷彿自己先伸出一隻手來，蘇聯儘可以消除疑懼，同美國公開討論，互相讓步，免除一切的衝突。</p>
<p>和平必須互信，諒解基於互讓，這是顛撲不破的真理。現在世界上關心國際政治的人士，除非政治上有了成見，對於美蘇緊張關係的造成，沒有理由，把全部的責任加在任何一國當政的肩上。我們只能公平的說，在過去美蘇兩方面在互信這一點，似乎都還有點兒不够。史達林認爲戰爭不可避免，杜魯門也有類同的宣佈。蘇聯不顧人民生活，全力擴充軍備，美國似也不能不有所準備。蘇聯在國外擴張勢力，自然要碰到美國的阻力。在聯合國機構，外長會議，巴黎和會中間，美蘇的代表和兩方面比較親近國家的代表，對於任何問題，都堅持到底，劍拔弩張，很不容易獲得滿意的解決，其原因也就在此。勝利已過一年，世界不能安全，美蘇之示涌互信互讓，要負很大的責任。</p>
<p>在貝爾納斯的演說裏，他特別指出以和平方法解決世界問題的四個先決條件，其第一點即指出民族間建立互信及協調精神的必要，同時又須極力排除惡意宣傳；他自己這種演說，便出以協調精神，而企圖建立互信；故全篇文字率直坦白，不失爲一種足以珍貴的外交文獻。至於其它的三點，若各國必須在聯合國機構下，並在尊重聯合國的權威下尋求合作，沒有一個國家可以自命有『美德與智慧的獨占』，及沒有一個國家可以脅迫，威脅，所以武力填動其它民族的已得權益，在目前這種國際形勢下，應該爲一般國際關係的準則。貝氏又云：『我們彼此間必須要合作—否決或沒有否決—來保衛聯合國憲章的原則和目的……。』我們願這種協調精神能够有所感應，則國際合作當不難實現，世界持久和平的確保也可以有望了。</p>

<h3>中醫師應規定診金</h3>
<p>讀十四日「秋掠病又多，病人對於醫師診金不堪担負」一文，曷勝皇然，筆者對於上海醫師診金，參差不一，久擬請政府明令規定，或云恐滋物議，故遲　行，總覺若骨梗在喉，不得不吐，爰貢　之見，述之如下：</p>
<p>査醫者三大要素：曰學，曰識，曰膽，讀破萬卷書，前無古人謂之學，經騐素宏，審症確　，謂之識，對症發藥，攻補適宜謂之瞻。三者具備，古之人以爲醫道畢於此，乃今人已並此不易言矣，茲筆者舍此別有所謂根本者在焉，根本維何，道德是已，若舍道德而言學，不免文其奸，舍道德而言識，不免狃於偏，舍道德而言膽，不免滋其妄。况醫師性情不一，流品不齊，秘傳師說，各承其是，不有醫德，範之使歸於正，則慧心仁術之盛業，不幾於巫卜相伯仲，使神聖之醫術，若長空電掣，忽掩忽明，古澗泉流，若斷若續，寗不可惜。特是道德無他，一操行淸純，二智能高尙，兩者已足盡之矣。</p>
<p>惟道德與名利，原不相侔，維能舍利者，始可與言之。若醫師索酬，病者酬醫，理所然也。惟今之醫師，於醫德則反是，對於一已之修金，習尙參差自是，好行昂值招搖，俾遂自矜身價，而病人無知，以其診金之昂，遂謂其術之必精，爭相延致（對西醫亦如此）於是醫師之計得售，世况如此，則虛偽愈工，不習欺詐，難謀生活，上海醫風至此，直不堪問矣！孟子云：惻隱之心，人皆有之。業醫者，旣操司命之權，自當抱濟世之心，乃乘人於危急之秋，爲落井下石之舉，撫躬返省，背德取利，可乎否乎？大資產者無論，貧病者何堪？應請援二十六年前京市政府，規定中醫師門診，出診，掛號金，統一辦法成例，行不本市，始可與言「嘉惠貧病」。（無我）</p>
<p>改善浦東交通事業</p>
<p>要整刷市容，繁榮都市商業，必須先把烏烟熏天的工廠先遷徒到市區四郊去，但是要建立市區四郊交通網綫，也是刻不容緩的事吧！當局也曾考慮到這問題的重要性，而有「浦江鐵橋」的計劃；惟對目前現有的交通，似亦應有予以改善的必要。</p>
<p>（一）修正市輪渡的標準時間在這「屋荒」的都市裏，一般薪水階級公務人員等，沒有「金條」頂洋房，因此祇得向市區近郊的小上海—浦東去覓住屋，在過去夏令時間，第一班市輪渡到達上海碼頭時祇八時，晚班返去是六時啓駛；這對於機關或寫字間時間尙不衝突，而往返尙能從容趕及，本月一日起，始改爲標準時間，晨班到滬，竟九時二十分，末班返浦時是五時三刻；這一來對一般晨出晚歸的機關寫字間職員，竟弄得焦頭爛額。</p>
<p>（二）修築公路後再行行駛公用汽車，在總理建國方略中有「建立十萬里公路，十萬里鐵路」的計劃，記得在民國二十年間，我政府當局，曾在浦東沿浦一帶興築煤層公路，在戰前爛泥渡與洋涇鎭間，更有公共汽車行駛，但在此八年多中，經敵僞的破壞，年久失修，因此該項路面，已弄得「千孔百瘡」，此次勝利後，公路未經修築，即行恢復公共汽車，加以路綫頗長，於是把這大好公路，更變成東一個窟窿，西一個地穴，崎嶇萬低不平，雨天時更汚泥飛濺。</p>
<p>末了，筆者在報端見公用局有取締人力車，淘汰三輪車之舉，但見車夫們，又爲了生活的威　，有晋京請願之行。據筆者之管見：不妨把此等被吊銷之車輛，准予在郊區行駛，一則可維持該等車夫生活，二則因車身較輕，可保持目下公路之完整，當局諸公以爲然否？（馬敏）</p>
<h3>公園宜有健身設備</h3>
<p>本市市民健身之所在，僅市體育館一處，（以近市區中心者言）其健身之設置，亦只單雙槓各一，且其下非沙坑，而爲方磚硬地，鄙人親見有某市民因練單槓不愼，致失手墮下，結果，頭破血流，方磚地上血跡斑斑，若其下爲一沙坑，則雖或受創，則必不致如此厲害。公園爲市區中空氣最潔凈之地，每日早晨必有不少市民在此鍛鍊體魄，何不假公園之所在，劃一區域，由設置單雙槓一二，以爲市民運動之地，且佔地不廣，何樂而不爲，此在有關當局只一舉手之勞耳，然於國民健身，不無裨益也。</p>

<h3>保衛帝國中東生命綫　英防務計劃輪廓　將在非洲東西兩岸設墓地　三千哩公吃路綱橫貫黑大陸</h3>
<p>〔聯合社倫敦十九日電〕英國東方生命綫之改組，結果或將在非洲東西兩海岸設立基地，由通過「黑大陸〕之三千哩超等公路加以銜接。此一帝國防務計劃之輪廓，由政府·殖民部及陸軍部方面宣露，因中東專家多人及軍政領袖正薈集倫敦，舉行連續會議。此一計劃之背後，暗示英國決定退出埃及，中東之重要政治糾紛及第二次世界大戰之重大敎訓，即地中海並非不可攻破者。新任殖民大臣瓊斯今日接見記者，對此偉大規模之改組，初次作明白之指示。據稱，目前討論一項計劃，擬在非洲西海岸之尼奇里亞建築大規模基地，與以前所傳政府將在根雅殖民地東岸設立基地性質相同。瓊斯之言雖以殖民活動爲限，不發表詳情，但據軍界消息靈通人士透露，兩海岸基地倘若設立，則國防顧問將建議建築人造公路，通過赤道非洲沙漠業林與沼澤，加以銜接。新任國防大臣亞歷山大首要任務之一，即在研究此種交織之建議，而向內閣提出帝國整個軍略計劃。英國軍政領袖討論英軍撤出埃及與印度獨立所可引起之果，已歷數月·據軍界人士稱，各專家向艾德禮首相提出之報吿書，對於英國在中東之軍事作用，確定四點：即（一）防衛大陸間生命綫——該綫現自直布羅　蘇　士通至印度洋。（二）防衛中東各飛機塲，此乃現代交通所必要。（三）防衛伊朗與伊拉克之油權。（四）與阿拉伯世界維持長久聯異，並促進對土耳其關係。</p>

<h3>盟國對日管制委員所任工作有名無實　英方冷淡美蘇同床異夢</h3>
<p>〔聯合社東京十九日電〕日本與匈牙利同爲戰敗國，同樣設有盟國管制委員會，担任有名無實之佔領工作。蘇聯　然以匈國之眞正老　自居，麥帥亦　然以日本之眞正老　自命，日本境內聯合國統帥部不歡迎管制委會之觀念，甚至在管制會議以前，即已如此表示。管制會成立六個月，麥帥代表，即管制會主席艾其森之吾論，暗示麥帥相信該會並無效力；事實上，管制會之主要作用等於一塊强度之響板。美蘇雙方利用以互相指責，擴大宣傳。蘇聯代表特萊夫揚柯顯然認爲管制會略有用處，特氏可在會議席上反映蘇聯政府對麥帥之情緒，麥帥之處理佔領區事務，則受蘇聯報紙之抨擊。英國代表巴爾認爲管制會縱有任何價值，亦甚稀微；中國代表朱世明則唯艾其森馬首是瞻。管制會四代表對會議本身價值發生懷疑者，至少有兩人，乃至三人，則該會又將有何成就乎？截至目前爲止，該會已通過土地改革法·勞工法並聽取關於日本煤礦國營之種種建議。莫斯科外長會議組織對日管制會，以供麥帥諮詢，麥帥顯然決定該會不應越入對日佔領行政之範圍。艾其森會以行政事件爲由，率爾摒絕大部份出自蘇聯之若干建議。各代表在會議席上憤然謂：統帥部對彼等之建議旣不承認，亦不表示反響。艾其森之不變的答復，則爲統帥部歡迎批評；換言之，即麥帥考慮彼等之意見，而自定主張。</p>

<h3>日本紡織業迴顧與前瞻</h3>
<p>〔本報東京特派員十九日電〕日本紡織工業具有近代工業形態，始在明治廿五及廿九年間（即一八九六年，）當時僅有公司五十七家，紡錠六十萬零八千個。英美兩國早在一八四六年即已建立近代化紡織業。一八四六年英國已有一千五百五十五萬四千六百十九錠；美國則有三百五十萬錠。紡織業是日本中心產業之一，曾替日本帝國建立向外擴盛之基礎，日本帝國係以輕工業起家，一部日本帝國盛衰史即可謂爲一部日本紡織業發達史。日本棉布首次向外輸出之對效是中國，始於明治廿四年（一八九零年），當時日本國內發生經濟恐慌，銷路停滯，不得不向外開拓市塲。該年輪入中國之棉布，的六千四百卅五斤，（每斤爲零·六公斤）隨商品轍出之展開，資本輪出乃接踵而至，據金鋼鑽經濟雜誌統計年鑑載：昭和十五年（一九三九年）日在華紡織廠商，計有五十四家，（包括東三省在內）有二百廿二萬三千二百錠，織機三萬四千三百架。日本內地紛織業因受戰事影響，和平產業多轉換爲軍需工業，且因空製關係，致生產一蹶不振，中日戰爭勃發當時可說是日本紡織業，最發達時期內地運轉錠數計九百零七萬零三百個，生產棉紗卅四萬一千四百捆，（每捆四百磅），現日本內地廠商計十三家有三百五十萬錠；惟現運轉錠數僅一百六十萬，十月至十二月間，可增至三百五十萬錠，根據此種錠數計算，每月需棉十萬捆，日本內地並不產棉，戰前日本多由印度及美國輪入，昭和十二年中日戰起時，日本輸入印棉七百零一萬六千二百卅八捆，美棉則佔第二位，計四百廿二萬三千九百六十四捆，戰後美國第一艘棉船，於六月間開入日本，截至最近爲止，開入日本之棉船計廿四艘，輪入棉花在五十萬捆以上，本年三月美棉業代表團抵日時，日方曾要求美方於本年內輪入美棉八十九萬萬捆，迄六月，知日方此種估計過大，日本廠商生產力，無法消化此數，乃改爲卅一萬四千捆，根據盟軍最高統部計劃。本年輪日美棉共計可達五十七萬六千捆，年初，日方對纖維工業甚抱樂觀，在戰後經濟復興工作中，以纖維工業屬第一位；惟因勞力及糧食不足，增產計劃完全失敗，且受電力供給之限制，其他如石炭不足，資金困難等，亦爲纎維業不振之最大原因。本來預定之棉花消化量，八月份爲五萬捆，僅消化百分之六十七，計三萬三千捆。九月份之六萬二千捆，僅消化百分之七十，計四萬捆。如長此以往，對美棉之輸入不無影響；輸出纖維製品，交換糧食及其他必需物資之計劃，亦必發生障礙。日當局有鑒於此，商工省曾於前週在大阪會議，有麥帥總部代表，日政府方面地方當局，十大廠商·各工塲塲長出席，通過促進纖維產業案，請政府採納實行，其中包括六條：（一）以纖維爲最重點產業保證，所需資材優先入手，（二）增加纖維工業勞動者之糧食配給，（三）工資一部份以工塲製成品支付實物，（四）調整被害工塲之復興資金。（五）設棉紡織生產技術促進委員會。日政府曾於本月十一日召開閣議，就此案作具體決定。東洋經濟週報載稱：各專家刻正起草一復興纖維工業三年計劃，豫定於一九四八年時，各種紡織品生產額將達十億磅，其中棉織品將達六萬五千萬磅，人造絲織品爲五千五百萬磅，人造毛織品爲三千五百萬磅，毛織品爲三千六百萬磅，麻織品爲一千六百萬磅，其他織物爲三千五百萬磅。</p>
<p>此生產額中，百分之四十係作輸出百分之四十則爲國內消費，其他百分廿係製品原料。根據該項計劃，棉織品百分之五十二將供作輸出，百分之四十八爲國內消費；惟此種計劃豫定輪出之棉織物數量，尙不能完全償付國內棉花之悄費量。據某方面意見：此種比例或將有所變更，輸入量將增至百分之六十，國內消費量爲百分之四十，即輪出額將達四萬萬磅。</p>
<p>日棉布輸出之最盛期昭和十二年，棉布輸出類約六千四百八十五萬七千二百磅。日本此種計劃如一旦實現，不僅爲我國紡織界之勁敵，印度紡織業所受影響亦甚大；巨此種計劃係以國際獨占資本爲後盾，不無實現之可能。同時，日本纖維工業設備並不列入賠償範圍之第一位，最近華府方面咸認日本在戰後東亞復興工作中，將盡指導之任務。</p>
<p>據聯合社華盛頓廿日電：美國浸禮敎會牧師約翰司登博士於視察遠東各地返美後，發表談話，他說：日本好像是一個眞正的戰勝者，因爲他們復興國家和儲糧的工作較菲律賓和中國都要迅速，可見美國朝野議論之一般，這是值得我紡織界警惕和努力的地方。</p>

<h3>利用小型電波偵查機　警備部在江寗路五十一弄　破獲秘密電台　拘獲青年容樂天一名　主持人吳鐘渭尚在逃</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕淞滬警備司令部，曾於本月八日下午會同江寗路警察分局，在該管江寗路（即戈登路）五十一弄一五二號內三層樓上破獲一秘密電台，負責發報之青年容樂天一名當場被捕，惟主持人則尚在逃，僅悉係一年近花甲之老者，名吳鐘渭。查該秘密電台設立迄今將近二旬，即在同一屋內之住戶亦未能洞悉其詳。蓋該處爲一經營進出口之商號，名永昌隆字號，經理岑傑生，廣東人，早已離滬赴港，所有『業務』由店員李先廷生負責，而被捕之容樂天亦爲該店職員，故是否與該店有關，尚在偵查中，茲將破獲經過誌次。</p>
<p>緣當局鑒於目前時局之嚴重，深恐有人乘機利用電訊，從事情報工作，因以技術方法，測騐室中電波。突在西南方發覺電波有特殊波動。因即按照此一電波方向，派遣幹員持流動式之小型電波偵查機，以最新式之科學方法，進行初步測查工作。經數日測查結果，查悉此秘密電台設於滬西江寗路上（即戈登路）。因復添增大批技術人員，至江寗路加緊調查。迨工作人員經過江寗路五十一弄時，偵查機上電波突然清晰，確定秘密電台係設於該弄內。乃在弄中繼續測量，至一五二號時，偵查機上電波大爲顯明，因斷定秘密電台確在該室內。當時以佈置未臻完善，深恐打草驚蛇，即於該屋門外密作暗記。次日與江寗路警察分局取得聯絡後，即由一穿制服之上校軍官，率領軍警十六名，分三組包圍該處，留一組分守前後門，另兩組則由前後門衝入。惟時室內秘密工作者尚不知情。偵查人員直上三樓，發現有青年男子一名，坐於發報機前，正從事發報工作。當即人證并獲。經聽詢結果，該犯名容樂天，復根據供詞，續在二樓亭子間衣櫥內搜出大型機器一座，及應用機械十餘件。因事關擾亂電訊，且有從事情報工作，及破壞國防建設之嫌疑，即將人證一併送交警備司令部軍法處法辦。當局現正加緊搜索餘黨，以期一網打盡，確保國防上空中電訊之機密。</p>

<h3>上海扒窃党的黑幕（一）</h3>
<p>— 黃嘉謨</p>
<p>租界時代孕育滋長</p>
<p>在最近幾月中，上海警察局對於『扒竊黨』的肅清工作，曾經下了大決心，在幾度雷厲風行的搜捕之下，落網者已有一百多名之多。這種扒竊黨是膠着在上海市上的百足之虫。在過去租界時代，警政操於外國人手裏，所謂『巡捕房』者，其內幕的情形，與及警察機構之欠靈活，都是造成了扒竊黨根深蒂固的主要因素。而該黨中的『爺叔班子』（即幫派中的大小頭目的綽號），都依靠『白相人』結交一部份巡捕房的刑事頭目與翻譯員，居然神通廣大，（個中人切口爲『兜得轉』有恃無恐。（切口爲『穩罩排頭』）。</p>
<p>對準本國同胞下手</p>
<p>在外人統轄租界時代，他們以上中所最注意的祇是外國僑民的安全與福利。至於寄居租界內的中國人民的利害如何，他們却漠不關心。</p>
<p>『扒竊黨』中人，深明此種畸形局勢，於是他們扒竊劫奪的對手，便不選擇『紅毛』或『老毛』，（均是外國人之稱），而專門對準了可憐的本國『同胞』下手。這是該幫黨羽活動的主要信條。他們反正都是『衣食不足』的流氓，所以祇談利害而不談禮義的。我們還能够厚責他們嗎？</p>
<p>這利害關係說起來是很簡單的，如果外國人被扒竊了，該管區的巡捕房，便不能不公事公辦了。這一來，那些素來坐領太平俸祿的捕頭，二道頭，三道頭之流，便須出動查辦，事實上自然一查便可查到，那時陰了『嘔扒』（即吐出所竊財物）之外，少不得抓捕幾個竊賊拘辦一番。這就變成了偷鷄不着蝕把米，究竟是够麻煩的事。因此之故，捕房的黑幕中人時常會『誥誡』幫黨中的頭目，千萬勿向『老毛』下手，免得弄到大家遭受苦難與煩難。</p>
<p>那時的白僑僑民却無福消受同等的『免疫』權利，因爲白俄人民沒有治外法權，那時且未得蘇聯官方的保護。扒竊黨深知國際形勢，因此居留在舊『法租界』的白俄人民，也和我同胞享受着被扒竊的權利了。</p>
<p>在日寇統治的期內</p>
<p>自太平洋戰爭事發生，日寇霸佔了『租界』的統治權之後，警政更加腐敗黑暗。扒竊黨在戰敵期間，混水摸魚，趁火打劫，着實『日進斗金』，真是自扒竊黨活動的半世紀來最得意的時代。英美人都進了集中營，敵人變成了統治階級了，幫黨中人使認敵爲『頂頭上司』，輕易不敢對日人下手了。這是扒竊黨的善於迎合潮流，是該黨發揮善於權變的處世術。</p>
<p>日寇素以警政昌自詡，何以統治『租界』後，弄得一籌莫展呢？其客觀條件的欠缺固然很多，最要的原因，還是人手不足，不得不仍舊借重『巡捕房』時代遣下的一班人。這班人一面照舊與幫黨勾結，以獲非法之利，一面對日寇警政當局，又不願精誠合作，所謂『瞞上不瞞下』。又值戰亂之時，大家祇想乘機『撈一票』，日寇此處也祇好徒嘆奈何了！</p>
<p>爺叔招兵打開出路</p>
<p>上海扒竊黨的前身，便是『老弟兄幫』，那原是上海都市特產的一種貧氓集團，俗稱爲『癟三』者是。此輩原是寄生在本市的落魄丐流，終日蓬頭垢面，躑躅街頭。但是丐幫中的少壯派人數，越來越多，他們不能於乞討的困苦生活，該幫中的『爺叔班子』，便乘機招兵買馬，把這一股街頭生力軍訓練起來，便成爲今日的扒竊黨。</p>
<p>扒竊黨以鋌而走險爲活動原則，憑藉着『租界』的特殊環境，與及『共扒弟兄』（合作夥伴之謂）的幫忙，居然打開一條出路，獨霸扒竊市場。『黑心銅鈿』（不義財也）滾滾而來，個中人也漸漸也『穿綢喫油』，搖身一變而躋身於四民之列。固顧那些鶉衣百結喫倒冷飯的昔日同輩，自然得意非凡。丐幫同流一見怎不眼紅，於是那些有『進取心』的丐流，也跟踪效尤，爭求出路。乞討本業祇有無出息的老弱者在支撐下去。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕遷來本市住宅區，時有不速之客三人或兩人，駕自由車至各里弄裝有電話之住戶，强迫推銷鉛皮印就之『緊急電話一覽表』。該表三吋長，二吋闊，上用紅色印警局·救火會等電話號碼十三個，薄薄一片，竟索費二千元。且聲勢洶洶，自稱電話公司派來，不可不買云云。經記者向電話公司詢問，知公司從未派員向用戶推銷任何物品，幸各電話用戶勿受其愚，如再有發現，可扭送附近警局法辦。</p>

<h3>房荒聲中上海的住　好比一聽沙丁魚</h3>
<p>在「寸金土地」的上海，住是一個很嚴重的問題。雖然有許多花園洋房摩天大樓，來點綴這世界大都市，可是大多數市民，祇能在鴿籠般的房屋中過生活，不但受大房東二房東的壓迫，而且往往與鄰居淘氣。</p>
<p>上海住的問題，是從人口激增後開始的。當開埠初期，租界限制華人居住。一八四五年，蘇松太道宮慕久與英領事裴爾福訂立第一次租界地皮章程，有「華人不得將租界內之土地或房屋，租與或售與華人，外人亦不得在租界內建造房屋，租與華人居住」的限制。本來這是純粹一塊鄉村土地，有的是泥淤沼澤，墳墓草糊，居民並不多，既加限制，除西人所雇用之僕役外，僅有少數供應西人日用所需之華人商店。一八五三年，租界內華人不過五百人。是年小刀會佔領上海城，居民紛紛避入租界，臨時搭屋居住，故在一八五四年租界內華人，已增至二萬，華洋雜處，從此開端。是年七月，英美法三國領事，重新擬訂地皮章程，默認華人得住租界。一八五五年，上海道正式宣布：以後華人准居租界，惟須遵守地皮章程，納付工程局捐稅。此爲華人正式居住租界之始。</p>
<p>自此而後，來滬西人日增，華人或因經商便利成因華界不靖，逐漸移入租界，租界人口，日增月盛。據前工部局報告，自一九六五年至一九三五年，公共租界人口，從九萬多人增加到一百十五萬人。租界當局屢次擴充範圍，界內又大興土木，建築房屋，來容納這大量的人口。就前公共租界一區而言，一九二五年，共有住宅房屋七萬二千餘幢，一九二六年增築三千四百幢，一九二七年增築二千四百幢，以後歷年續有增加，連閘北南市和附近市郊，居住的人也不少。但市區面積的拓展，受有相當限制，房屋建造，也不能隨人口而比例增加，所以上海的居住問題，始終未得合理的解決。</p>
<p>「八一三」以後，上海給敵人佔領了，剩下的祇有一個小小的租界，閘北南市和近郊的居民，都紛紛遷入，同時許多淪陷區中的人民，也集中在上海遂發生了嚴重的房荒問題。勝利以後，收復區的秩序尚未恢復，在上海避難的人，還得要住下去。而過去在後方的人，又一擁而至上海，華界許多毀却的房屋，却一時不能建造起來。房荒嚴重，較「孤島」時更甚。現在世界各地，都在鬧房荒，不僅上海爲然，可是上海將如何去解決這市民的居住問題呢？</p>
<h3>衖堂與洋房</h3>
<p>上海住屋，最普通的是里衖，此從中國舊式房屋演進而來的。舊式建築，都是幾間連成一列，小的三間，大的五間七間，宮殿一列多至十三間。上海房屋，即就舊式修改，客應臥室廚房天井，應有盡有，又有單獨的門，可以進出，自成單元最早的建築，大都是兩幢或三幢，連成單元，所謂「石庫門」者是。至於單幢，平民所居，大都在交通較爲不便的地帶。還有一種前面沒有天井的廣式房子，又稱爲「東洋房子」的，也不很受人歡迎。</p>
<p>其後逐漸進步，里衖住宅，也更變爲新穎了。高度由二層增爲三層。除水電外，又有衛生設備。內部構造，更趨洋化，外觀有英國式，法國式，西班牙式，立體式…等等講究。這種新式房屋所在地點，隨市區之擴充而轉移，環境較清靜，租金也較昂貴。</p>
<h3>西式住宅</h3>
<p>西式住宅，最初僅限於外僑居住。其後許多高貴華人，也開始住「洋房」了。不過中國人的習慣，究和西人不同，覺得洋房很有許多地方不適合國人之用。所以住者，不過極少數的時髦人物而已。同時他們雖住洋房，其實很多地方，還保存着中國國粹。許多富商，自己購地，建造住宅，外面雖是洋式，內部已改成中國風味，甚至外表也帶着一點中國化的。</p>
<p>最早的洋房很寬大，與中國房屋相彷彿，有很大的草地和花園。後來面積慢慢地縮小起來。過去一二畝地，只建一宅，現在可建七八宅了。雖是世界各地趨勢使然，但也未始不是地價太高的緣故。</p>
<h3>洋房的氣派</h3>
<p>洋房雖然高貴，但都市中人，流動性較大，大部份還是租賃的。至於自造住宅，往往要比租賃的來得寒窗，外面雖看不出些什麼，內部裝修，相去天壤。上海富商私邸，裏面富麗堂皇，即帝皇之居，亦不是過。室內燈光色彩，都富有藝術氣息，大理石級，嵌砌出自名家之手，天花板上，全是彩色圖案，墻壁則用花紋相反的木片鑲成。冬有水汀，夏有冷氣，鈎心鬥角，甚至舞廳，戲台電梯等等，設備俱全。僕役所居，在中等人家看來，也望塵莫及。</p>
<h3>住宅區的發展　由東及西</h3>
<p>上海市面，是由東而西，逐步發展的。河南路一帶，本是拋球場，後來才成爲鬧市。住宅區域，漸漸向西開拓，然亦不過至跑馬廳而止。民國初年，梅白格路尚稱新馬路，房屋寥寥可數，四周大半荒田。游人所聚，僅在張園附年，已算極遠。其時各地兵亂，故盡室遷滬者益衆。愚園路上，建築物與年俱增，遂成爲最高貴的住宅區域，取舊時之白克路而代之。當時人稱愚園路爲上海「精華」之所在，甲第連雲，盡是鐘鳴鼎食之家，可以想見其盛。日寇侵入租界，滬西忽變「歹土」，居住前公共租界者，人懷戒心，遷地爲良，於是前法租界，應運而起。今自貝當路至福開木路一帶，又取愚園路而代之。夾道濃蔭，路平如鏡，達官貴人出入之所也。</p>
<h3>民初一幢屋　每月租金八元</h3>
<p>民國初年，貸屋於南市最熱鬧的裏馬路，月納八元，可得兩上兩下新屋一所，即新馬路一帶，每月亦不過十餘元，若至廿元以外，已覺不勝擔負。民國十五六年，猶在五六十元左右，頂費不過一二百元，此指普通住戶而言。若愚園路一帶，西人所居，大都以規元計算，問津者少，且無自備汽車，不能直達，一般人力有所不勝。迨後公共汽車通行，間有里衖房屋可租，移居者漸多。自東而西，上海住宅區之轉移，大概如此。</p>
<h3>鴿籠式的住所　一幢房屋住了十五家</h3>
<p>上海人口如此之多，居住問題如此難以解決，那末擁擠情形，究竟已到如何程度？依前工部局一九三年的戶口調查，租界內共有一·一五九·七七五人，所住面積爲五·七二三英畝，平均每英畝的人口密度爲二百人。但這還是整個的計算，其中有一部份房屋，用於工商業，另外又有許多富商大賈，房屋固然很大，又加上草地花園，却住了寥寥幾個人。前公共租界工部局曾組織一個調查居住狀況委員會。這委員會於一九三七年提出報告。據稱租界內的單幢房屋，每幢住四家的計二萬二千七百六十四家，住六家的計一萬四千〇二十八家，住九家以上的計一千三百〇五家，最多的，一幢房屋，曾住過十五家。</p>
<p>戰前，民國廿四五年間，上海的房屋另闢了一條新途徑，向郊外發展了新村建設運動，當時以薔薇園新村最爲大而又最完美（見圖），所惜戰事發生後，都毀於砲火了。現在上海鬧着極嚴重房荒的時候，何以尚無人來提倡這運動呢！</p>
<h3>匪夷所思</h3>
<p>小小的一所單幢房屋要住上十五家，不知是如何搭配的，真成爲鴿籠。某報記者曾把一幢房屋的分配計算一下：樓下客堂隔爲前後兩部，住兩家；廚房改作房間，住一家；前面天井搭棚，住一家；樓上客堂間，分爲前後兩部，住兩家；廚房上面的亭子間，住一家；屋脊　斜之處，搭成擱樓，住一家；晒台搭棚，住一家；半扶梯中間，也搭擱樓，住一家；再走上扶梯對面的角落裏，可容一榻之地，也算一家；扶梯底下，再住上一家，一共是十二家，至於一幢房屋可住十五家，如何支配，真有點「匪夷所思」了。</p>
<p>上海市擁擠至此，實在是個很大的社會問題，直接妨碍居民的衛生和健康，減短壽命，同時又影響到國民的風紀道德，社會的秩序安寗。不過上海市民，能得到一小方的居室，已是很大的幸運，如何能計校其他呢？社會進步，固然繁榮了都市，但這是否是人類的幸福，却須另行評價。</p>
<h3>上海是不是良好居住區</h3>
<p>上海的住既這樣的不合理，發生困難，但一批一批到上海來的人，何以如此之多，有點令人難解，問題是在「上海是否爲一良好的居住之所」。這一問題，曾有兩次作爲辯論的題目。一次在民國三址年四月十日西僑青年會舉行，又平欠則在同年六月間青年中學舉行。</p>
<p>好的方面看</p>
<p>從好的方面看：上海是全國第一大都市，實業·文化·交通·都以上海爲中心。世界文明的熏陶，科學的灌輸。上海也得風氣之先。在建設方面，有整齊的街道，高大的房屋。市區交通便利，車輛多如過江之龍。一切物資文明，均爲他處所不及。甚至說到街頭乞丐，所得慈善團體的救濟，機會也比較他處爲多。</p>
<p>再從反面說</p>
<p>再從反面說：上海彈丸之地，住着五百萬人，擁擠程度，等於極　，衛生設置，尚未臻完善之境。表面雖是一片繁榮，實際上却充滿了黑暗，成爲罪惡淵藪，到處爲引誘青年墜落之所，即未埋葬在魔窟中，所受精神痛苦，也瘊不是物資享受所能抵償的。</p>
<h3>巍峨的公寓</h3>
<p>上海正是由這正反兩面相互構結而成的。但到上海來的人，很少從這方面去看。在未到過的人，以爲上海是遍地黃金，俯拾即是。不知上海有三十三天，也有十八層地獄，流落在上海者，數目更不少，上海固有都市的優點，但也不能否認這許多污點。我們要維持這世界大都市的地位，應如何改善，去補償其缺陷呢？</p>
<p>上海地價，隨人口增多而上升，影響及於建築物最大。要在一塊狹小的土地上，容納更多的人口，祇有建造佔天不佔地的摩天大廈，像跑馬廳畔的國際飯店，外白渡橋堍的百老匯大廈，外灘的中國銀行，可算是上海的摩天樓了。但和紐約比較起來，仍如小巫之見大巫。最初這種高的建築，僅限於公共場所，如寫字間，旅館之類。大馬路日昇樓相近之樓外樓，曾出過風頭。華安公司的八　樓，重陽日常有人去登高，慢慢這種廈大，用作住宅，稱爲公寓。</p>
<p>公寓</p>
<p>都是三層以上的大廈每層納爲數宅，分別出租。每宅小者有臥室，起居室各一，另有廚房，浴室，儲藏室。臥室亦有多至數間者，大的則有膳臆，書室，僕役室。公寓內容，與普通住宅不同，皆鋼骨水泥的大建築，有電梯，有暖氣。房間內部有柚木家具，雲母石壁爐台，掛衣壁櫥。浴盆，電灶，冰箱，各式俱備。租價包括房捐暖氣冷熱水等費用。假如房間數目相同，則比新式里衖房屋，約貴一二倍。</p>
<p>民國十年前，上等公寓尚少，僅在靜安寺路，海格路，愚園路，辣斐德路一帶有之公寓。住戶，十九皆爲外僑，甚至有拒絕租與華人者。十九年至廿四年間，公寓建築，便如雨後春筍，以霞飛路西段，貝當路附近，及滬西一帶爲多。崇樓傑閣，高出雲霄，充分表示了都市中欣欣向榮之勢。</p>
<p>衖堂式的公寓</p>
<p>在公寓建築發展之際，尚有一種衖堂式的公寓。新式里衖，朝街一面，樓下嗣作店面，上層改爲公寓，此種公寓大都三層，實爲里衖之一部份，即格式與容量寓也屬一律。設備較大廈式的公，略遜，租價亦較便宜。這種衖堂式公寓，在上海尚少，大多在靠近邊區一帶。</p>
<p>建築公寓，可省面積，在繁盛的都市中，能使住宅數量增加。可是設備富麗，租金高昂仍使一般平民，望而却步，如能勘察面積大小，地價高低，而定層數多寡，每宅之內，不使有絲毫浪費，設備上亦力求質樸，則租價減低，一般市民均得享受，必可爲解決都市居住問題之一助。</p>
<p>天堂裏的地獄！</p>
<h3>天堂裏的地獄　幾張蘆蓆幾梱草　貧賤不如豬羊舍</h3>
<p>精緻的小洋房，崇大的摩天樓，點綴了這都市。但是都市所擯棄的邊界上，還保留着許多草棚，和高樓大廈，作一强烈的對比。這種草棚，散佈於楊樹浦，曹家渡，北新涇，閘北一帶。從棚戶的生活來看，使人決不信在天堂上的上海，會有這樣的人間地獄。</p>
<p>棚戶大都從貧瘠的故鄉，因嚴寒的威脅，流浪到這輝煌的都市中來的。可是這偌大的上海，却無法容納他們。於是幾張蘆蓆，幾梱草柴，他們也把住所建立了起來，既不必費錢去雇用泥水匠，更毋需去請教工程師。這五六方尺的面積，高不及肩，一家老小，衣於是，食於是。光線的暗淡，地面的潮濕，都不必說，一遇狂風暴雨，住在草棚內，和露宿也差不了許多。</p>
<p>這種棚戶，據民國廿五年公安社會兩局調查，共有二萬餘戶，約十萬人。在租界中的，尚不在內。此乃都市中的一個污點。要解決這問題，當時市政府，成立了市民福利事業管理委員會，興建平民住所，以救濟這種爲生活而掙扎的平民。</p>
<h3>平民新村</h3>
<p>最先興建的平民表村在其美路，共兩百餘宅，分甲乙兩種，光線充足，空氣流通，和豬圈式的草棚相比，實有天淵之別。此外另有平民小學，浴室，禮堂，診療所，合作社，運動場等等設備，計劃週詳，平民受惠不淺。其後纔在中山路，大木橋，普善路等處，闢地一百二十三畝，建屋千間。這雖由當局極大的努力而來，但與所需要的數字相差尚遠。可惜八一三的砲火，又把平民新村裏的居民，趕到草棚中去了。</p>
<h3>天之驕子二房東　依然晦氣三房客</h3>
<p>上海人口風續不斷地增加，房屋需要，十分迫切，許多人便建造房屋，出租謀利，土地房屋，在上海乃是一種商品。</p>
<p>業主所有房地產，往往分爲許多單位出租，里弄中每幢房屋，自成一單位。像市民這樣鷄零狗碎的分居，業主是不肯來作這築瑣的工作的，是以有許多人將租下來的房子，再轉租一部份給別人，這便產生了所謂「二房東」和「三房客」這兩個名詞。最初，分租時真是有餘屋的，在房屋過剩的時候，二房東往往有空貼房租的危險，同時房客又良莠不齊，甚至有以租屋爲名，而實行盜刦者，所以不肯公開張貼召租。但後來屋少人多，供不應求，二房東就成爲「天之驕子」。一幢房屋，二房東所收租金，除付大房東的房租及水電等費以外，大但自己可白住，並且還有盈餘。在上海淪爲「孤島」的幾年中，二房東一家的生活，可以全靠這幢房子來解決。三房客是加重了屋剝削，大房東也蒙受損失。</p>
<p>在房屋供不應求的局面之下，往往有許多怪事發生，大房東見二房東生財有道，也設法加租，可是大房東只加五元，二房東却多收二十餘元，羊毛出在羊身上，晦氣的還是三房客。做三房客的，又設法來做房東，把租下來的房屋再轉租出去，以是又產生了「三房東」和「四房客」。最有趣的，有一間較寬大的灶披間，三房客自己搭一櫊樓，轉租給四房客，非但房租可以不出，按月還賺十多塊錢，這是從前的事，現在更非昔比了。</p>
<h3>房租和頂費</h3>
<p>上海市民雖住得如此狹隘，可是房租的負擔却不小，本來業主建造房屋，當然要計算他的成本，如地價，建築費，設備費，修理保險等開支，以及折舊的準備，根據所付本錢，而計逄租金，以求合理的利潤，這是最正當的。可是在供求不相應時，租賃關係，決不如此單純。</p>
<p>多數市民，房屋並不是向業主租來，而是轉向二房東租來的。二房東憑藉了這所奇貨可居的房屋，從中牟利，使市民繳付更大的租金。這在業主看來，乃是一種損失。在租不到屋子的時候，大房東當然也不肯輕易放過這機會，凡直接向大房東租借房屋時，必得化上一筆額外費用，從前少者數百元，高至數千元，勝利之後，更以條子計算，稱之爲「頂費」或「小租」。頂費原是前一房客留下一部份不能搬移的裝修等等，轉讓給後一房客的名目，可是往往一所空無所有的房屋，也要向你索一筆頂費。</p>
<p>頂費本由前後房客所發生的關係而來，所以最初也僅在房客間互相交易，房東有時做個「煤介」罷了。後來漸漸地變了質，一所空屋，甚至一間也好，不空的也可以，都認爲是生財之道。房客佔據了房屋，不肯放棄，房東想盡各種方法，要逼房客出屋，以是房東與房客之間，租賃關係的糾紛，層出不窮。有訂定期租約的，期滿之日，即是糾紛發生之時。無定期租約的，也有以收回自用的名義，請房客遷讓，也有以加租方式，迫使房客移居的。業主對房客如此，二房東對三房客也是如此。</p>
<h3>一個矛盾現象</h3>
<p>上海居住不易，但在另一方面却有又許多空屋待租。前公共租界工部局曾發表過一個精確的統計，租界內空着的中式房屋一九二〇年，佔百分之〇·八，至一九二七年，增至百分之四·一，一九三四年增至百分之五·三；西式房屋未租賃者，一九二〇年佔百分之二·三，九二六年增至百分之八·二，一九三四年增至百分之一四。數十年來，上海人口的增加，顯然超過了居住的增加，則供求不相應，乃必然的現象。何何以又有這許多空屋沒人顧問呢？可見上海的居住問題，雖然是患不足，却也是患不均。房租高昂，頂費驚人，使市民不得不實行緊縮，侷處一隅。一九三六年，前工部局房屋委員披克演講居住問題，指出「市民的收入減少，使房屋中聚居的人數增加，應向房東呼籲，減低租金，使房屋不致空間，此乃繁榮上海根本之圖。」</p>
<p>召頂廣告觸目皆是</p>
<p>目前上海房荒嚴重，當不致再有空閑的房屋。可是我們翻開報紙來看，召租召頂的廣告，每天占却許多篇幅，南京路同羽春茶樓，也擠滿了人，在談房屋租賃的賣買。房屋何嘗是沒有呢？可是沒有房屋可住的人，同時也沒有金條，所以祇可望「屋」興嘆。房屋租賃委員會爲解決上海房荒起見，曾想了許多方法，作一較爲公平合理的支配。但一房房屋，往往有十倍以上的人來申請，申請的人，固然有的是無屋可住，但也有已住很好的房屋而仍來申請的，試問他們的用意安在。</p>
<h3>沙遜與哈同　兩個地產起家的猶太人</h3>
<p>上海人口增多，地價飛漲，是以有許多商人經營地產業。講到地產業，忘不了這兩位上海大地主，沙遜和哈同，他們都是英籍猶太人，由經營地產發跡的，今在上海仍擁有很多的地產，雖然哈同早已故世了。</p>
<p>聳峙於南京路外灘的沙遜大廈，是上海數一數二的建築物，此即沙遜所有地產之一，仔如在上海所經營的事業——新沙遜洋行——也在其內。其他如福州路之漢彌登大廈，都城飯店，蒲石路之華懋公寓，邁爾西愛路格林文納公寓，北蘇州路之河濱大廈等，均爲沙遜產業，價值驚人。沙遜生於印度。初，其父及叔在滬經商，範圍甚小，大戰時，英國財政拮据，徴稅奇重，沙遜乃將大量資產，移在上海，遂爲滬上外僑中之大腹賈。</p>
<p>沙遜跛一足，往往「姍姍來遲」。性好遊樂，雖步履維艱，雅興不減。現仍孑然一身，每年　遊孟買，倫敦，加拿大，香港等處，因各地均有資產也。在滬時常任沙遜大廈之華懋飯店中，其辦公室亦在大廈三樓之極東一端，佈置陳設，光怪陸離，方其俯瞰浦江輪舟出入，手持電話聽筒，觀測時變，發號施令，固洋洋自得也。</p>
<p>哈同，爲伊拉克籍猶太人，自幼父母雙亡，因生活掙扎，隻身飄流至上海，在沙遜家中司閣，受沙遜之賞識，乃調入老沙遜洋行中辦事。時沙遜所經營者，以洋藥（即鴉片）地產爲主，哈同一面在內工作，一面補習文字，孜孜不倦。在此時期，學得許多經商經騐奠定了日後致富基礎。</p>
<p>哈同財星高照，連中了一次跑馬票，一次廣東票，而沙遜對他的信任心，也與日俱增，升爲新沙遜洋行協理。其時哈同已入英籍，成爲英僑中之佼佼者了。除做沙遜協理以外，同時利用彩票所得的資金，和職權上的便利，在滬大量購置產業。最熱鬧的南京路，幾乎半條是他的，但當他購買時的時候，那裏還很冷落，地價非常低廉。迨後南京路成爲投資建設的目標，地價飛漲，哈同便成了海上鉅富。</p>
<p>哈同和他的妻子羅迦陵先後去世之後，愛儷園中，留着許多螟蛤子，對於哈同所遣下來的龐大財產，引起不少糾紛。這海上名園，從此籠罩着烏烟瘴氣，已不似昔日的靜恬了。</p>

<h3>卅四年所利得稅　商會斡旋之經過　總額二百億標準待研究　不苛擾不走漏大體圓滿</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕卅四年度所利得稅之簡化稽徴，本市已在正式展開中。代表全市各工商業公業公會，與稅政當局折衝之市商會，二度召集各重要公會，報告接洽經過，說明應付方法，已兩誌本報。據參與此事之潘士浩氏語人，市商會有公會會員二百餘單位。二個月來，已向會申報其各會員之資本額，營業額及盈餘額者，計公會單位二百十八，包括納稅單位即公會會員二萬七千餘戶。尚有非公會會員申請者六個單位。總計全體申報表帳面盈餘，約一百三十億。以納稅單位言，雖未報齊。但以全市工商業之帳面盈餘言，當無大差異。因未辦申報之公會，都係業務簡陋，組織較薄弱者，實際上原無足重輕。至已報之各公會中，亦有一部份會員迄未填送。則都係並無盈餘，甚至停業之份子，所漏當屬有限。以常情論，不無可原，依法而言，無論如何，報表必須填送。無完全之帳薄者，亦不妨估計申報。時歷二月有餘，而此點迄未貫澈，承辦人頗引以爲憾。稅政當局對於此種未報單位，聞將嚴厲處置。後果如何，更堪焦慮。</p>
<p>預算限度</p>
<p>依大後方成例及簡化稽徴之法理言，必須先有具體之稅收預算總額，然後可照各業實際之標準純益率，分別攤算。本市預算必須核實估計，然後攤算方得公平，此點市商會主張頗堅，稅政主管長官亦漸漸明瞭。近經商會諸君與王署長面洽，預算額大致可減至二百億，聞財部原定預算雖亦經修改，而離此尚遠，則各方面須縝密商討。行將召開之審查委員會當以此爲討論之焦點，日來商會與各公會所商討者，即以此爲範圍。如時間許可，尚須召集未及邀致之各公會，當面報告。就各業已報之成績估計，一百三十億加五成計算，亦僅够接近二百億而已。</p>
<p>負擔能力</p>
<p>而以當前各業之情況而言，有無此負擔能力，尚爲待決之問題。卅四年度中本市淪於敵偽之手者約八個月。及敵日屈膝，偽府瓦解。而復員工作，仍未能迅速。工商各業於收拾餘燼之後，能安心營業者能有幾日，迭據各同業公會申報時來會說明，如敵偽强迫徴購，統制管理，斷電阻運，橫徴暴歛，强取豪奪，都是一片血淚帳。實情如此，負擔能力可見。且偽幣終於按二百作一計算，此種暗虧，元氣至今未復。商會曾數數以實情告當局，其主管長官亦甚明瞭。因此王署長迭次託商會勸告各工會，務須仰體政府財政困難，格外幫忙。在工商業之意，以爲工商業當應維護政府，而政府亦當體恤商艱，予以援助。目次銀根如此之緊，生產貸款如此之難，四聯總處及大四行等一貫作風，並未稍變，此二百億之稅款，如何羅掘，頗成問題。</p>
<p>不許苛擾</p>
<p>市商會在萬分困難中折衝此事，目的在避免徴稅之苛擾。據有關方面所透露之消息，有不少人主張『嚴查』。且稱查出不符實況者，可如何如何罰辦。幸稅政主管長官不許苛擾，暴風雨迄未到臨。商會方面日內即將以各業公會所送來之報表，原件送交直接稅局。稅局即依照此項報表，分別核算稅額，填發納稅通知書，逕送各納稅義務人。納稅人憑此逕向國庫繳款，不復查帳。此點在商會方面，認爲保障工商業之要着。業經杜月苼徐寄廎駱清華諸與直接稅署王撫洲署長洽定，當不致有何變化。根據此點，則納稅人之所出者，即爲國庫之所入。官方不苛擾，中間不走漏，可稱國庫商清，兩面俱到。</p>
<p>標準純益</p>
<p>在技術方面，稅局尚在鄭重研究。依照簡化稽徴辦法，必須有各業標準純益率用作依據。進而就各戶之資本額或鎖貨額計算其應納之稅額。照此辦法，各戶實繳之額，將與各該戶所報之根據不同。換言之，各業應各有一個標準純益率。在同一業之內，各戶一律照此標準，按其銷貨額或資本額計稅。此項標準純益率，在商會方面已根據各業各戶填送之報表。編成若干資料。惟將來擬捨去不用，而按各戶所填報之盈餘額計稅。因在三十四年中，有偽幣，法幣，老資本，新資本，先調整，後調整等關係，不宜依常例求出銷貨標準，純益率及資本標準純益率也。</p>
<p>任務將了</p>
<p>市商會之設稅務專門委員會，純係爲解除三十四年度所利得稅之糾紛，由理事會中互推五人擔任，仍隨時商承諸元老之方針辦理一切。今稅務告一段落，此委員會聞將結束。未了事務，由理事會直接辦理，委員會主任委員駱清華氏因公在京，俟固申後，當可決定。</p>

<h3>改良蠶種不够用中蠶積極準備中</h3>
<p>江浙兩省原爲我國蠶絲區域，戰前蠶種產量，蘇省之春用改良種，爲一二〇至一三〇萬張，土種約一五萬張，秋用改良種，爲七〇至八〇萬張，浙省之春用改良種，爲一一〇至一四〇萬張，土種約一五〇萬張，秋用改良種一二〇萬張，抗戰期中，經敵偽之摧殘，本年份產量，蘇省降爲六五萬張，浙省僅五萬張，連同由日輪入三十萬張，全數不過一〇〇萬張，中蠶爲明年發展蠶絲生產起見，以先從增進蠶種着手，除早就昆明，草壩，雲南蠶業新生公司，製就新品廿五萬張，已由十八日由昆運抵上海冷贜備用外，另處蘇省各製種場，製就七五萬張，浙省一五萬張，綜合一一五萬張，以備明年育蠶季節分發各地蠶農使用，惟據業中人估計，明年春洞改良蠶種需要量，蘇省爲四五至五十萬張，土種五萬張，浙省爲五〇萬張，土種五十萬張，若以改良種代替土種，則原有數量仍感不敷，中蠶當局，對此仍希望努力進行，以冀明春蠶種完全採用改良種，則生絲收獲自可加多，且其品質亦可改良云。</p>
<h3>紡織廠商談平價　政府實行監督嚴禁囤積廠家參照市價大量拋售</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市六區棉紡織業同業公會理事之間，昨日午後曾在非正式之會議。據參加該會議之某理事表示：渠等之共同意見，將於今日紡管會開會時提出，而不準備另作書面之請求。彼個人對此問題之看法，則認爲政府應站在監督之地位，嚴禁紗廠有囤積行爲；同時紗廠應參照市價，大量供應市場，如此則紗布之漲風，方可有效遏止；即使一般物價續漲，紗布之漲勢亦必溫和合理。猶憶八月中旬匯率調整後，物價起劇烈之波動，此時各廠即以紗三萬包，以略低於市價之價格出售，結果紗價隨之而穩定，足資證明。</p>
<h3>台米源源運滬本市糧食無虞</h3>
<p>本市民食問題自經當局積極疏通來源後，供應已不虞缺乏，前途極爲樂觀，據糧食主管當局聲稱，本市民食恐慌，以夏季最爲嚴重，嗣經行政院朱院長派員赴台，洽妥啓運大批台米運滬，國內川贛等省及越南暹邏等地亦有鉅額食米運滬，並開始無限制供應，自當局採取此一指置後，米市即見穩定，而台省一地每年三熟，產米甚豐，國營招商局正指派專輪源源運米來滬，故本市市民食，今後已可無虞，吳市長現對中等米之價格，已嚴令不得超過四萬六千元云。</p>

<h3>廠用國棉　僅有三百萬擔　多數用於家庭手工業　五年計劃我不逮印度</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕經濟當局對我國棉紡織業之發展，已有成竹。即希望在五年之後，我國能擁有七百萬之紡錠；以消費量而論，每人每年能享用十五公尺之布。按印度亦有紡織五年計劃，其目標爲五年之後，每人每年能享用三十碼之布。兩相比較，我國猶嫌落後。關係人士告記者：我國目前棉紡織業已開工者約有二百五十萬錠；損壞而待修理或電力不足而待開工者，約有一百五十萬錠。過去英藉專家曾力勸我國注重修理舊機，以省財力，實有卓見。以原料而論，今年國棉之收成爲六百萬担，其中半數將耗於手工業及其他家庭用途，故明年實際可用之國棉，僅有三百萬担，而運輸問題之解決，尚需努力。其餘不足之數，尚需美棉補充。陜棉品質戰前本佳，最高可紡四十二支細紗，但因戰時無暇改良，目前品質已有變劣之趨勢，此則值得我人之注意者。</p>
<h3>華絲銷英　已在接洽中</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕關係方面消息：英國將來可能爲我國生絲市場之一，中英商業界近對此屢有接洽，英國願出之價格，且高過美國，但需要數量則不及，絲業界人士表示：目前我國生絲之售價，約有百分之三十爲高利貸之利息，如得國家之低利放款，成本必然大減，在國際市場上之競爭力將相對提高。以品質而言，華絲尚遜於日絲，此則亟待努力改進云。</p>
<h3>敵偽產業處理局　決定年內結束</h3>

<h3>拜耳藥廠　將歸商辦</h3>
<p>近日市上一般西藥，因受美貨湧至影響，大都虧蝕甚鉅，但我方已接收之德商拜耳藥廠所出之西藥銷路，仍能堅挺，據敵偽產業處理局拜耳廠清理處主任李菊人氏語人，謂其原因，由於拜耳之信譽甚佳，今因該廠結束期近，原料有限，故所出產之西藥，仍極受外界歡迎，又該廠清理工作，已有一半辦理完畢，約可於明春結束，據聞政府因不願與民爭利，故該拜耳藥廠，將招標民營。</p>
<h3>捲烟實行新稅　廠商擬再呼籲</h3>
<p>本市華商捲烟廠商，以捲菸稅率，照新章實行，使廠商增加負担，捲菸業公會暨各廠負責人，定於今晨上午十時，全體赴財部貨物稅局，向方東局長詳詢中央對捲菸業前次請願時所提出之各項請求，究竟作何處置與救濟，假使當局仍無具體辦法答復，預料今後華商捲菸各商，頗爲困難。</p>

<h3>美棉花交易所停市　清理三日來之巨額交易　有人指摘空頭操縱市面</h3>
<p>〔路透社紐約十九日電〕紐約，新奧林斯及芝加哥棉花交易所今日均告停市。據紐約棉花交易所當局稱：此項決議係爲顧全公衆及棉花交易所之利益。同業方面認爲此舉乃欲使經紀人得有機會，以便清理三日來巨額之交易。交易所中職員今晨仍忙於簽證週五成立之交易，此種手續平時在當天下午四五時即可辦理完畢矣。</p>
<p>〔路透社新奧林斯十九日電〕關於本日停市一節，棉花交易所發表聲明如下：新奧林斯棉花交易所董事會鑒於過去數日中棉花市場之混亂情形，一致通過該交易所暫行停市，以便清理上星期內之交易及賬目，此舉對於一般棉業裨益非淺。謠傳若干人士資金周轉不靈，實係誇大其詞。所有交易均有足額保證金，亦無退票等情，大約至本週末局勢即將澄清，本交易所定於十月二十一日照常營業。</p>
<p>〔路透社紐約十九日電〕紐約棉花交易所今日宣告停市一事，似並未引起同業之憂懼。據一般觀察，此舉目的乃欲清理自週三以來所成交之巨額買賣。過去三日中棉花遠期成交數總計一百七十四萬八千包，爲近數年來所罕見，但一部份人士對於棉花交易所停市加以誹謗，謂『賣空者有操縱嫌疑』，參議員湯麥斯謂棉花經紀人與交易所有意將市價抑低，並要求聯邦當局監督商品市場。因爲其他　物價以及棉織業的情形均極良好，何以棉花獨突然遭受打擊云。</p>

<h3>橡膠月需兩千噸　在目前尚不虞外貨競爭　高利貸高工資阻礙發展</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕太平洋戰爭勝利後，世界樹膠之供應，即由英美法荷組織聯合橡膠委員會，澈底加以控制。截至此時爲止，我國橡膠之來源，全自香港轉口而來，並未得聯合委員會之直接供給。本市橡膠業公會對此曾向經濟部有所請求，茲悉經部已委托該會調查重慶天津瀋陽廣州橡膠業之需要，以便轉請外交部向華府直接交涉。現渝津瀋三地已有覆電來滬，預計每月之需要量在二千噸以上。據本市橡膠業公會理事長洪念祖氏語記者：本市橡膠廠在五十家以上，加入公會四十餘家；運銷號大小五百餘家，入會者二百餘家。目前橡膠業之景氣爲暫時性質，原因爲：（一）戰時受日人統制民間缺貨，目前亟需補充，且以價廉之故，需求量甚大。（二）供給不足。目前之產量僅及戰前之一半，此蓋由於戰時設備之損失，今日電力之限制，及一般工人效率之低落所致。（三）外貨未來。以車胎而論，美國戰時大量使用人造輪胎，品質甚劣；目前出產之天然橡皮車胎，自先儘本國使用，無暇外銷。在明年夏季以前，外貨不致大量擁至。此種因素，亦足以造成我國橡膠業之景氣。展望我國橡膠業之前途，欲求其長足發展，除政治安定交通恢復之外，必須取締高利貸；並自工價之穩定中，力謀成本之減低。</p>
<h3>上海製皂工業現狀</h3>
<p>— 章柏庵</p>
<p>肥皂爲日用必需品，也是油脂工業之一部，我國大規模之製造工廠，可說祇有二家，一家是外人經營的，一家先由外人經營而後由國人接辦的，其餘的不是中型製造，定是小型製造。</p>
<p>黃祥茂，固本，這兩種肥皂，現在幾乎是行銷到全國每一個角落裏，誠可識無遠勿屆，這兩塊牌子之所以成功，只有一個秘袂—數十年如一日，並不是僥倖得來的。</p>
<p>勝利以後祥茂皂，到現在還不曾製造，據說英商鑒於我國工潮澎湃，兼之英國經濟力量，尚未復蘇，所以『祥茂』的前途還在未定之天。</p>
<p>『固本』呢，直到現在，不曾停過製造，但是比起以前來，大有今昔之感，『固本』在上海的製皂工廠有兩處，一爲現在每日在製的小沙渡路廠，一爲徐家匯廠，規模之大，在中國可說是首屈一指。小沙渡路廠，一直沒有停過工，徐家匯廠，曾經被敵人管理過，現在才完壁歸趙。前者每日產量是六百至七百箱；後者，一倍於前還不止，兩廠同時開工，每月產皂約在五六萬箱。</p>
<p>聽說勝利以後，外人曾經來察勘這二個工廠—祥茂與固本；祥茂的設備比起美國的工廠來，相差十五年，而固本則已相差廿五年了！但是在中國還是無與倫比！現在『固本』廠每日產量爲六百箱，僅小沙渡路一廠在造，聞不久徐家匯廠即可復工，惟因國內交通困難，原料阨於運輸，是否能搜購到偌大的油脂，恐怕還是問題。</p>
<p>製皂工業，甘油是唯一的珍貴副產。祥茂，固本都是採收甘油的。甘油存在於肥皂中，不但失却了寶貴的副產，而且肥皂的品質反而低下。</p>
<p>其次我們要談到中型皂廠，中型皂廠如南陽皂廠，也是一塊頂括括的老牌子，它有了近四十年的歷史，因爲從產造嚴格上得到了極大的成功。該廠曾受到嚴酷的戰時損失，不久由於『人爲』的努力，而復原了！不過現在產量方面，只及五洲固本現產量三分之二，它的一塊『南陽超等』，與五洲固本，直等於姊妹肥皂，同時出產一種藍色桶皂，正適合於洗染工業用途，上海大部份的洗染工業，都是用它的藍色桶皂。該廠業務近正積極推進，最近聞已向外國去訂購新式製皂機器，產量將盡量擴展。一般人說來，這塊牌子，或將於幾年以後，狂跳起來。</p>
<p>它如光華皂，亦是中型產造，不過光華皂，歷史非常短，可是它是『後來居上』，是無可否認的，這塊光華皂的推銷方法，誠可謂無微不至。</p>
<p>至於小型皂廠，在滬地多得不勝枚舉，競爭亦非常熱烈，但多因爲資方薄弱，在大型中型的同業林立之下，經營者，煞費苦心。</p>
<p>製皂工業，因爲第一是日用必需品，第二外貨競爭的可能性很少，所以它的前途，比較光明。但我們希望各大廠能够自己製碱，自己製皂，這纔符合完全國貨哩。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕羣聲籃球隊定今晨五時半凱旋飛返菲島，雖經體協副會長吳紹澍竭力設法挽留，但隊員在滬月餘，歸心如箭，該隊原允昨晚與華勝賽畢後，再與征輪作表演賽，惜昨晚未成事實，該隊與征輪互換照片及錦旗，以作紀念。</p>
<p>大失所望</p>
<p>昨晚與華勝之戰，羣聲再獲勝利，結果四十二比二十八，上半時羣聲以二十八比十四分佔先。市體育館觀衆滿坑滿俗，惜昨晚因求勝過分心切，華勝方面犯規纍纍，以致精彩全無，下半時華勝罰剩三人，無法替補，草草終場，觀衆大失所望，雙方犯規次數，共達五十三次之多。</p>
<p>罰球得分</p>
<p>羣聲隊仍由陳氏昆仲二蔡一楊五虎出陣，華勝則以傅金聲·王有才·王鴻斌·劉學錡·王堪若應戰。執法官瞿鴻律·鄭志芳·王鴻斌首先犯規，楊人輝一擲不中，王堪若再度違法，文章得一分，先開紀錄，金置金德昆仲每投必得，十比一領前，比時裁判瞿鴻律，眼鏡爲球敲破，由劉荷生出替，繼續比賽，第一節十八比五，再度交鋒，郭金銘調出劉學錡，金德錦上添花，廿一對五，王有才長射，首開滬隊擲中紀錄，王鴻斌五次罰出，劉學錡再進場，但對局勢無補於事，羣聲如入無人之境，而華勝犯罰次數則愈多，學錡又畢業罰出，分數爲廿八比十四，完成第二節。</p>
<p>三人應戰</p>
<p>下半時再行交綏，卅二比十四，王堪若又告五次罰出，尹煥文入替，戰局仍在一面倒情勢中，第三節比數爲卅七對廿。最後一節，犯規次數愈多，對果華勝僅餘三人應戰，時羣聲亦無心交戰，以相互派司了事，結果四十二比廿八。</p>

<h3>臨別紀念表演賽　義僑敗於混合隊　球藝生疏結果三比零</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨日秋高氣爽，義僑足球隊在滬作臨別球賽，與華人混合隊交鋒，球迷紛至杳來，席上總計不下四五千人。混合軍之組成，以最近不疏於球事者爲原則，故挑選目標，根據小型球聯賽成績爲標本，唯昨日仍有嚴士鑫費春華韓龍海李垚四將誤卯，幸生力軍到齊，顧以撤趙永芳吳凱敏雷樹苹遞補，比賽結果，混合軍仍以三對〇大勝，上半時一對〇。</p>
<p>心餘力拙</p>
<p>義僑心餘力拙，隊員類皆面有菜色，可見邇來營養不足。混合隊前鋒雖屬集自各隊，但顧以撤雷樹苹高秀清三小將，俱見情況正常，尤以顧以撤演出，最爲精彩。賈幼良之右翼雖未即其如何努力，而所得之第一第二兩球，均有幼良傳出造成者，功實非淺，守衛方面有孟義良瞿永福張根主持，頗見頭頭是道。</p>
<p>一球佔先</p>
<p>比賽因混合隊員，姍姍來遲，延至三時十分佈陣，裁判吳守衡，戰局展開，雙方均現生疏，極少精彩，至廿五分鐘時，高秀清得孟義良傳球，交送賈幼良，幼良巧遞空隙，羅旭萊阻空，雷樹苹竄進一撥，麥尼蒂撲救不及，上半時混合一對〇領先。</p>
<p>三元連中</p>
<p>休息後重行對壘，義僑銳意反攻，惜無成就，四分鐘時，混合突見活躍，雷樹苹搶得來球，交撥幼良，幼良盤上一步，五鋒挺進，賈一脚傳右，雷故造空拉，高秀清球到人到，打成入角底，清晰美麗。入後義僑雖頻頻反攻，混合竭力守禦，未有得逞，三十四分鐘時吳凱敏又在人叢中擊破空門，未一分鐘，笛聲長起，混合隊以三對〇潰退義僑。昨賽兩軍同意上下半時各踢三十五分鐘。</p>

<h3>少年支隊堅強　集寗會戰的旋律</h3>
<p>— 五日豐鎮航訊　本報特約記者劉映元</p>
<p>〔少年〕支隊因攻佔卓資山，蒙受一部份損失，故這次攻打集寗時，原擬做爲預準部隊。十日上午突城時，「黃河」支隊曾一度進入橋西，由於後繼部隊沒有跟踵而入，故遭受了挫折，撤至駱駝　子以北和共軍對峙。這時集寗外圍的國軍祇剩下一個「少年」支隊，在集寗西南郊掩護攻城部隊。當天下午一時共軍由南面增援的野戰，即向「少年」支隊發動猛攻。白天發現的是獨一旅，到人黑以後三五八旅亦加入戰鬥。雙方拉鋸七次，共軍始終沒有突破「少年」支隊的陣地。</p>
<p>十一日上午，共軍的外圍部隊，都到達國軍攻城部隊的背後。白天我方除了鞏守臥龍鐵軍兩山，並分出兩支部隊向外反擊。「少年」支隊由左翼向南迂迴，曾迫近蘇集車站附近的山頭，並佔領馬德靑地。「黃河」支隊由右翼朝白石頭　　，向北衝殺。這天共軍未行激烈抵抗，祇是將外圍部隊直往西邊環繞，一直穿過鐵路綫，散佈到霸王河邊，形成更大的包圍。日落以前我反擊部隊不敢繼續深入，當即奉令收兵，撤團屬於黃家梁的原陣地構築工事。等待共軍猛攻，以保全「勝利」支隊在鐵軍臥龍兩山已經鞏固的地位。</p>
<p>入夜以後，共軍的外圍部隊，完全返回，便以主力向我「少年」支隊的黃家梁陣地進攻。曾突破候家村，到達駱駝　子，把邊家村的「少年」支隊指揮所轟擊。「勵進」縱隊的指揮所也受了影響，隨後移至鐵軍山，和「勝利」支隊會合在一起。這時「黃河」支隊在右翼和共軍對峙，「少年」支隊的梁張兩個大隊，遭受到共軍五旅以上兵力的波式環攻，共軍雖以連縱隊猛撲八次，但「少年」支隊始終沒有把黃家梁放棄一直支持到十二日天明。</p>
<p>局勢危急之夜</p>
<p>十日夜晚，國軍的局勢最爲險惡，突城的部隊沒有入城，掩護的預備部隊，被共軍重重包圍。增援的「唐聲」縱隊還在凉城一帶，與集寗相距二百餘里。共軍突破候家村防綫到達駱駝　子後，「勵進」縱隊的直屬小都隊即行混亂，潰兵並且將「黃河」支隊的陣地影響。有的竟退到地城子一帶。「少年」支隊指揮所被襲擊時，參謀長和副官長都受了重傷，支隊長指揮小部隊，竟掌握着兩個大隊和共軍抵抗。同時跟「勵進」總部失掉連繫，使得「勵進」縱隊的最高指揮官，進入鐵軍山上「勝利」支隊的陣地，和集寗城相距不到三里。</p>
<p>這一晚上集寧城裏的共軍，曾反攻臥龍鐵軍兩山，有幾决撲到碉堡附近，皆被我以重火力壓下。當時在黃家梁「少年」支隊，能够戰鬥的不到六百餘人，除了北面可以和鐵軍臥龍兩山，上邊的「勝利」支隊，用信號槍呼應外，其餘東西南三面却被共軍包闡。共軍是以連縱隊猛攻，第一連傷亡殆盡，第二連又繼續衝上，成了打不勝打，防不勝防的局面。最後典軍和我們混在一起，互相搶砲奪槍，「少年」支隊有一挺重機槍被共軍抗走，射手顧不得拉火，竟以手榴彈代替鐵錘，把敵人的腦袋打碎後，才將機關槍奪回。由此可以看出十一日夜間戰况，是進入怎樣險惡的境地。</p>
<p>那一夜共軍在指揮上犯了一個重大的錯誤。如果在突破候家村到達駱駝　子以後，不包圍「少年」支隊的陣地，而直撲臥龍鐵軍兩山，同時和守城的共軍，一齊前後夾出「勝利」支隊，祗留下一小部份牽制住「少年」支隊，就可賜予國軍不堪設想的遭遇。但是他們沒有如此做，而係專心一意的想把「少年」支隊殲滅；不料遇到「少年」支隊的沉着應付，將共軍大量的兵員火力浪費。要是沒有「少年」支隊的堅決抵抗，十二日下午援兵開到，亦無法挽救集寧外圍戰的危局，因此「少年」支隊在集寧會戰中，榮膺十二戰區各部的冠軍。</p>
<p>救兵來自天上</p>
<p>十二日天亮以後，國軍外圍的局勢，已經逐漸好轉。因爲十一日夜晚共軍傷亡非常慘重，第二天黎明後，「少年」支隊陣地的四週，滿山遍野都是穿灰色軍衣的屍體。約有七八千其，不過援兵來到以前，情况依舊吃緊。果敢的「勵進」總隊指揮官當時並沒有死等增軍，便讓「勝利」支險攻城。同時把「少年」支隊調到臥龍山，將「黃河」支隊調到鐵軍山進行防守，以築小防綫。等的援軍開到，「勝利」支隊已經突入城內，把橋西大部控制。</p>
<p>增援的「國光」支隊，係十一日夜晚由卓資山奉命出發，沿途在鐵路綫上，和共軍逐站進行野戰。邊打邊跑步的，於下午三時到達集寧近郊。他們先在二十里外打了兩砲，皆中集寧外圍共軍的陣地，共軍馬上發生了恐慌。卓資山相距集寧一百八十餘里，共軍派出三個旅阻撓我們的援軍前進。據共軍估計國軍的援兵，最早要在十三日上午才可到達，共軍在十二日夜晚，就可把攻城的國軍全部殲滅。訛想「國光」支隊於十二日下午四時，就以跑步趕到。所以共軍認爲國軍的救兵從天上飛來。渲時共軍官兵的一塲好夢，被「國光」支隊兩砲打碎，士氣頓時低落，陣勢顯現出搖動。</p>
<p>「國光」支隊開到以後，「勝利」支隊被興奮的情緒鼓舞，於天黑之前，又在集寧橋西攻克了幾個據點。頑强的共軍，這時仍不甘心，企圖作最後掙扎。所以人晚以後，共軍的外圍部隊猛撲「國光」支隊的陣地，指揮所亦遭受襲擊。這夜共軍的波式衝鋒，即達七次之多，結果共軍的迴光返照，終被「國光」支隊的火力撲滅。十三日我軍一面在城內繼續擴張戰果，一面抽出『黃河」支隊和「國光」支隊，將駱駝　子一帶的共軍完全衝散。延到日落以後，共軍的守城部隊，即被國軍完全驅出集寗。</p>
<h3>慘烈的巷戰</h3>
<p>西南角的突破</p>
<p>「勝利」支隊劉支隊長於十二日上午七時，把鐵軍臥龍兩山的陣地，交經「黃河」「少年」鞏守，便帶着二三兩個大隊，奉令向集寗城的西南角進攻。這時「黃河」「少年」兩個支隊除了對付外圍的敵人，還得掩護「勝利」支隊攻城，任務相當沉重。這次集寗會戰，國軍並沒有新式武器，我們主要以重機槍將共軍壓制的無法抬頭，然後派工兵上去，用炸藥爆破敵人的防禦工事。集寗城西南角外面的兩座兵營，和城南福音堂，就是川這種戰術，憑了不怕犧牲的兵士，很快的連續攻下。　突破西南角時，是以山砲集中一點射出，使城牆裂開，並且利用倒下的城牆，將暗　掩蓋。敵人雖在城內構成交久火網封鎖缺口，禁不住我們的戰士，提着機關槍往裏猛撲。當雷一樣的砲聲剛剛停止，集寗城西南角便升起一片黃塵，等到黃塵被風吹走，就有四五個院落已經抽上了鮮紅的國旗。我們初進入西南角的，祗有兩個中隊，還不到二百多人，便趁烟塵迷漫的時候，抽出一個中隊先將南門附近的麵粉公司佔領。守麵粉公司有一營敵人，都被國軍的喊聲怔住，被「勝利」支隊第三大隊第六中隊很從容的越牆跳入。</p>
<p>步兵在城西南角控制了七八個院子以後，砲車即跟着推入，共軍的機關槍子彈，紛紛被砲板碰到地下。十二日上午最被人目爲奇蹟的，是拉子彈的一百多輛馬車，也在西南角突破十分鐘後，不知從什麼地方趕到城裏。好像浩浩蕩蕩的騎兵戰車，敵人以爲國軍有許多隊伍入城。使的盤據在家屋裏的共軍，紛紛放棄陣地逃走，把許多可以鞏守的院落，給國軍騰出。這時有不少共軍將槍枝扔到街上，舉起兩手投降。</p>
<p>向郵電局進攻</p>
<p>西南角被國軍突破後，城內秧序曾一度紊亂。後來共軍司令部派出執法隊督戰，凡是由西南方向跑來的人，不管國軍或是共軍，一律以機槍掃射。並由政治人員散佈有利的謠言，才鞏固動盪的軍心。隨後城內的巷戰，演變成家屋爭奪。大多數共軍在政治人員監督下不敢繳槍，多半被國軍用機關槍封鎖住門窗，然後從烟筒中扔下手榴彈炸斃。當戰爭結束，淸掃戰塲時，我們發現每家人家，都有七八具屍首。</p>
<p>「勝利」支隊進人集寗西南角不久，「黃河」支隊亦突破西門。把橋西的共軍，牽制在各個據點家屋中，等待挨打。橋西敵人共有郵電局，姚喆司令都，警察局，蒙疆銀行等幾個重要據點。「勝利」支隊先打的是郵電局。郵政局上面置有重機槍四挺，控制一馬路和各街巷的出口。因爲「勝利」劉支長對集寗城內的地形很熟，他指揮工兵穿破各個家屋，呌砲車拉到對正郵電局的一條巷口，在二百公尺處施行誘導射擊。一面以電話連絡鐵軍山的砲兵，亦向烟塵處射擊，所以郵電局中了七砲後便行放棄。</p>
<p>集寗城內各街口，都設有暗碉。「勝利」支隊佔領了郵電局，一面用敵人的兩挺重機槍，在郵電局樓上壓制住橋東方面射來的火力，一面呌步兵登上暗碉，用手榴彈扔到射口內邊，把共軍統統炸死，以掃淸走廊。囚此國軍的攻城士兵，以手和腿受傷的最多。國軍在郵電局把一馬路打掃乾凈後，即在一馬路到北街的十字路口，架起山砲向北街路東的姚喆司令部轟擊。司令部院裏的砲彈爆炸剛停，「勝利」支隊的戰友如同神兵似的，便從對面商店中躍出，將國旗抽到姚喆平日居住的屋上。</p>
<p>共軍兩路反攻</p>
<p>守城的共軍，當我們佔領了郵電局正圍攻姚喆司令部的時候，曾抽出兩個團進行反攻。一個團山城北的鐵道柵子，向西門的國軍繞攀；一個團由城南的鑽道柵子，向南門附近的淸眞寺　擊。其時我們入城的部隊很少，臥龍　軍兩山的郃隊仍和敵人的外圍部隊對峙。入城部隊一方面須要固守已得的據點，一方面仍須繼續擴張戰果；所以我們對付共軍反攻的戰術，不是迎頭痛擊，而是將其當腰切斷，使光頭不敢深入。</p>
<p>共軍的兩路反攻部除，在頭一階段，很順利的將西門和南門附近的淸眞寺奪回。後一階段，因爲我們也抽出兩部兵力，佔領了兩個鐵道柵子，切斷其歸路。後來等到「國光」支隊的砲聲響後，我們復由城外調進「勝利」的第一大隊，「少年」和」黃河」的一部份部隊助戰，遂把西門和淸眞寺重新奪回。我們把共軍的司令部搗毁，他們撤至蒙疆銀行警察局之綫抵抗，姚喆曾親自督戰發動第二次反攻，所以西門和淸眞寺拉了好幾次鋸，雙方的死傷都很慘重。國軍竟以共軍的屍體，堆成肉袋進行作戰。</p>
<p>天黑以前，我們次第將西門和淸眞寺收復，共軍在蒙疆銀行，北鐵道柵子，警察學校，水塔，車站等處構築陣地，和國軍對峙。這一夜外圍戰爭仍烈，城內共軍由於白天傷亡過重，派出的士兵，都伏在地下不敢前進。國軍祗聽見遠處打槍，各據點附近並未發現共軍。同時我們以輕裝部隊在橋東覆繞，所以共軍顧了橋東顧不了橋西。本來那天的共軍，可以趁夜把已失的據點奪回，因爲士氣沮喪到極點，指揮官無法監視士兵，而沒有把集寗的危局挽回。</p>
<p>最後一天命運</p>
<p>九月十三日，是共軍在集寗盤據的最後一天，上午共軍的外圍陣容就行動亂，我所從「少年」和「黃河」兩個支隊裏邊，調出大部兵力入城鞏守據點，仍呌「勝利」支隊繼續攻擊據點，在日落以前，即將警察學校，蒙疆銀行，北鐵道柵子拿下，把橋西完全佔領。這一天共軍仍希圖掙托，抵抗的非常猛烈，尤其在正午的時候，爲了等待天黑撤退，愈發反撲的兇狠。每一間家屋的守軍，在共產黨員監視之下，除非被國軍全部打死，絕不輕易讓出，據老百姓們說，有好幾處院子里，都是士兵把黨員打死後撤退的。</p>
<p>共軍在集寗會二戰中，不少士兵表現的非常頑强。守車站水塔的一班人，配屬兩挺輕機關槍，在十三日那天，整整從早晨支持到黃昏，使橋西的國軍不能順利通過鐵道進入橋東。曾有二百多人傷亡。天快黑的時候，我們用了許多砲彈，由窗口射進，才將裏邊的共軍炸死，這個水塔的有四丈多高，完全是鋼筋水泥。非有精確的射擊，不能命中窗口。整個集寗會戰中，守水塔的十幾個共軍，是表現了最頑强反抗的一幕。</p>
<p>集寗最有名的老虎山，在此次會戰中並沒有起了重要的作用。原來十三日上午城內巷戰激烈時，「綏蒙軍區」的警衛營的大部份即由老虎山撤回，被「勝利」支隊派出少數人從背後拿下。他們看見老虎山失守，大勢已去，祗在車站，鐵路醫院，機關車塲等處抵抗戰了兩三個鐘頭。國軍把這幾個據點攻破後，在夜間十一點鐘的時候，共軍還發動了一次猛烈反攻。以後就感覺槍聲稀少，當我們到達電燈公司和縣政府裏邊竟寂無一人，才知共軍用猛攻速退的戰術，化整爲零的竄逃。</p>

<h3>集寗追擊戰</h3>
<p>共軍在九月十三日夜晚潰敗後，分三個方向退却。「晋察冀軍區」的隊伍由興和退往柴溝堡，「晋綏軍區」的隊伍由凉城退往左雲，「綏蒙軍區」的隊伍先退到豐鎭，又折向左雲跟「晋綏軍區」的隊伍會合。共軍的文職人員和搜刮人民的黃金，白銀，烟土，布疋早在卓資山失守後，即搬往雁北的山地，糧食則分存於集寧附近的商店農家、揚言此次係戰略撤退，如果人民將共軍寄放的東西繳給國軍，一定要遭受到嚴重的報復。所以國軍在集寧會戰中，除了鹵獲將近兩旅裝備的武器，並沒有接收到其它物資。</p>
<p>共軍退却方向</p>
<p>這次共軍潰退當中，在綏東察北徵拔的壯丁，大部趁敗放下武器潛逃回家。　北一帶的壯丁，則上山爲寇，希望國軍派人收編。河北和五台附近的壯丁，多能隨軍退却，不過非常混亂。祇有聶榮臻的基本部隊和賀龍的三五八旅，還是排着四路縱隊向東南和西北兩個方向行軍。並有掩護部隊在兩翼向國軍頑強抵抗，讓傷兵走到前邊，輕機槍手在後面邊走邊打。如果國軍的追擊部隊人數過少，他們還能掉轉頭反撲。因此我們的追擊騎兵，專門朝向這兩支部隊截擊。結果衝成七零八落。，</p>
<p>共軍平日對士兵進行兩種敎育：就是寧死不投降，和寧死不丟槍。政治人員宣傳謂：國軍對待俘虜特別慘酷，用各種的恐怖方法殺害，並且規定凡丟掉槍枝的，一律予以格殺，士兵如果投降，家屬亦受重大處分云云。追擊部隊曾經發現不少共軍，被包圍以後用手榴彈枕在頭下拉火自殺，生前絕不把槍繳給我們。有時將槍放下，亦等到我們的士兵前往檢槍時，用手榴彈同歸於盡。於是國軍遇見共軍，士兵不聽長官命令，便以機槍掃射。因此敗退的共軍，被我們生擒的，不如被我們打死的多。</p>
<p>鐵騎縱橫衝撞</p>
<p>「復興」縱隊把「鐵騎」支隊放在鐵路綫西南，將「靑山」支隊放到鐵路綫東北，做爲集　最外團的巡邏部隊。「鐵騎」支隊風馳電掣似的，在凉城集寧之間來往活動，使共軍捉摸不定，走到那裏碰見「鐵騎」。九月五日增援卓資山和由卓資山退下的共軍，聚集在卓資山以南的牛家川地區，企圖退往凉城，不想在五里塲，被「鐵騎」包圍，經過一小時的戰鬥，敵人就全部粉碎，打死三百多人，俘處二百多人，其餘都潰散在山野。</p>
<p>十三日共軍撤退集寗，「鐵騎」於十二日下午就由凉城轉到城西二十餘里的三義堂。十四日天明「鐵騎」從三養堂附近的葫蘆斯太出動，向凉城路上追擊共軍，專門找的打三五八旅，一直追了五十里，在豐鎭縣屬的馬迷圖，才把三五八旅的六團和八團衝散。此役共打死三百餘人，俘虜一百餘人，鹵獲的戰利品除步槍二百枝外，還有六〇砲和俄式輕機關槍多挺。三五八旅的執法營長，第八團政治委員，和第六團團長，前兩個被「鐵騎」的馬蹄踏死，後一個是用馬刀砍傷。我軍騎兵在馬身上打槍，如同俄國的哥薩克騎兵饒勇，共軍汚衊我們說，是裏邊有美國人參加。</p>
<p>「鐵騎」衝散三五八旅後，於十八日上午在新安莊連站，將共方「綏蒙軍區」騎兵旅康健民的殘部二百餘人解決，趁勝收復了豐鎭縣城。並連續克復隆盛莊等據點，在十九日下午到達興和縣城。興和縣城先是「復興」縱隊的「長城」支隊進入，共軍發現人數很少，便由柴溝堡調來「晋察冀第四軍分區」的兩個團反攻，沒有料到「鐵騎」和「靑山」支隊，在二十九日白天先後趕來，所以二十九日夜晚共軍的兩個團完全在興和城郊被「鐵騎」和「靑山」包圍，非降即死，沒有一個跑回柴溝堡。</p>
<p>青山風聲鶴唳</p>
<p>「靑山」支隊於九月卅日由武川開拔，在「少年」支隊進攻卓資山那天，就到了集寗城郊。「青山」支隊專心找的殲滅共軍唯一的騎兵「綏蒙軍區」康健民旅。五日夜晚在集寗城北二十五里的大土城子，將康健民的一個團打垮，後來調來兩個團增援反攻，亦被「青山」支隊擊潰。到七日天黑的時候，「靑山」支隊已經到達集寗城郊的北營子，炭密一帶，當天夜晚」復興」縱隊指揮官曾親自指揮「靑山」支隊，向集寗城垣猛攻八次，一度突入西北城，繞襲共軍的後方。</p>
<p>集寗會戰進行期間，靑山支隊在集寗城東北近郊活動，十三日夜晚共軍潰敗後，「靑山」支隊担任追擊鐵路綫四北的退却共軍。當晚在老平地泉，玫瑰營子一帶，把「晋冀察軍區」的隊伍打散。最奇怪的是老草圈地方，駐有一千五百多共軍，不知集寗失守，結果被「少年」支隊二大隊的三百多人閧走。十四日上午「靑山」支隊在紅海子找見聶榮臻的主力，將共軍的兩個團包圍，共擊斃五百餘人，俘處三百人，鹵獲各種槍械四百餘枝，剩下的共軍都上了磨盤山逃走。其後「靑山」支隊沿鐵路南下搜索，於十八日下午和大同方面開出的馬占山部，在堡子灣會師。</p>
<p>綏東民衆怒火</p>
<p>共黨行政人員在綏已在人民的　筋中，埋下極深的仇恨。過去因爲統治極嚴。不敢表示反抗，這次共軍在集寗崩潰後，便把無名的怒火，撲到被共軍裏脅的壯丁身上。演成很慘酷的農民互相仇殺。這種老百姓的憤怒，我們的行政人員，竟想不出有效的制止方法。共軍參加集寗會戰的共有八萬人，被國軍擊斃兩萬，受傷一萬五千，投降五千，逃到左雲和柴溝堡的共有兩萬，其餘兩萬多人，計有全部四分之一以上的兵力，完全被綏東老百姓剪除。</p>
<p>被國軍衝散的共軍，大部份脫離開部隊散佈到鄕村。綏東的民性特別強悍，過去出過盧占魁和蘇雨生等巨匪——所以看見共軍大勢已去，都起來「趁火打刦」。共軍在集寗進行四盡夜戰門，多半人困馬乏，並且被騎兵追擊的口鼻吐血，每到一個地方，便蒙頭睡熟，老百姓就利用這個機會，把槍奪獲。爲了滅口和　　將來，共軍很少丟槍以後能够生存，多半被老百姓用繩索勒死，拉到山滿裏邊埋葬。拍傷兵的民伕，也有爲了减輕負担，將傷兵用石頭壓死，然後放下担架逃走。</p>
<p>人民對共軍的報復行動，一方面固由憤怒所使然，另方面還有一個原因，便是出於自衛的要求。原來綏東人民的自衛力量相當充足，二十五年察北日僞軍進攻紅格爾圖和土木爾臺時，守軍主要是依靠民團把日寇擊退，抗戰以後，單是綏東五縣，就成立了一萬多騎兵。以後日僞把民有槍枝盡行搜羅，共軍來了才俯首聽命。這次共軍失敗，那有不搶槍的道理。關於共軍被人民留下的武器，很難調査得出，我們祗知道豐鎭的還鄕隊經過集寗會戰，由二百枝槍增到兩千枝槍了；並且豐鎭的槍價，比歸綏便宜一半。</p>
<h3>松花江畔國軍生活一斑　圖片說明</h3>

<h3>臺省傑構　水利工程嘉南大圳</h3>
<p>— 十六日臺北航訊　本報特派員暮雲</p>
<p>大哉水利洋洋乎發育萬物　陳儀語</p>
<p>台省水利工程的代表作——嘉南大圳，是堪以向內地紹介的。作爲台省水利工程的原始的，並非統治五十一年的日本人，遠在道光十七年間風山知縣（即今之高雄縣）曹瑾目覩高雄鳳山兩縣因爲缺乏水利，人民苦旱，就疏鑿下淡水河溪，經過四年，綿亙五里的舊圳竣工，後來又從十六粁延長到三十二粁，灌溉的水田也從三萬六千畝伸展到六七萬畝，後人紀念他的功續，特將該堤稱爲「曹公圳」。</p>
<p>在到二水的道上，記者曾參拜了林公祠，据說林公就是台中一帶的水利專家，在淸時完成建設以後，此公却不見了，當時祗知其姓林，就以林公廟來追念這個神。</p>
<p>所以說水利，人們當提起嘉南大圳，但人們決不會忘記，這原是我們古老的手法擴大而已。</p>
<p>十載工程</p>
<p>日本人在臺灣化費了多少心血，初到本省的都有一個槪括的輪廓。就以嘉南大圳來說，在民國九年九月開工，耗總工費四·二〇〇萬圓，其間因爲經費週轉困難，經三度波折，復增爲五·四一三萬餘元，（二千六百萬政府負担，餘數由地方組員攤派），施工期也展延十個年頭。</p>
<p>這個偉大的水利工程，日本人在實際的加強農田灌溉，並增加殖民地臺灣的生產以外，尚則有政治的意義，顧然的，他們以建設來獲致這南部太平原的民衆底心。</p>
<p>陳儀長官於本月七日特前往視察。目覩這偉大工事而題「大哉水利，洋洋乎發育萬物」之旬；而京滬平昆記者團於來合訪問的重要節目，除日月潭以外，就是嘉南大圳。這顯已遭致了各方的注意！陳長官深感到目前要完成日本人沒法完成的建設，以取信於民，問題在多數人均「麻木不仁」！</p>
<p>從業員工</p>
<p>嘉南大圳是槪括了臺南縣九個區和台南嘉義兩個市，這一個廣大的區域裏有着十五萬餘戶，一百萬人口，直接受有大圳之利的灌溉田畝有二百三十萬畝，這將是該圳唯一的經濟價値所在。</p>
<p>這個區域裏，以二千三百畝左右劃爲一個給水區，各個給水區內有小給水路，小排水路，合理地維持經營圳水的分配和管理，每個給水區內分成三小區：一區是夏季稻作，一區是乾燥季秋冬的甘蔗作，一區是雜作區，採取最經濟有效調節水量的三年輪作制。</p>
<p>台南縣政府建設局屬下有水利課大圳水利組合就是屬於該府管轄的，不過以範圍廣大事務紛雜另成立本部，有着十多萬組合員（包括地主和佃農），現在有一一五〇的從業員，辦理業務和監管，灌漑和水路的排水保護建築物的工作。</p>
<p>水泥建築</p>
<p>大圳的水源地，和日月潭發電所一樣，是烏山頭蓄水池，標高六六米，利用自然的溪谷構成珊瑚狀，貯水面積一一·〇〇〇萬平方尺，有效蓄量六六億立方尺，水深可達百六尺。最大的取水量一·八〇〇立方秒尺，這是以鐵筋混凝土造捲上式的水門，調節和取給曾文溪的流水，在標高二百二十尺（五六米）的堰堤下，有個送水塔，流速每秒一到二·五尺，河水從這裏通過延長三·一〇八米的隧道，順沿着二十八里的幹綫，分流到三百里的支分錢，一千八百五十里的小給水道去。</p>
<p>在蓄水池外，另有濁水溪左岸取水口，包括林內第一，第二，中國子三個，在溪流的護岸下。大圳的功效，一面是取水，同時還具有排水的能力，施設着一千七百四十里的排水路；而爲防水防潮免羅災難起見，築有八十三里的防堤和長一七〇里的專用電話綫和短鉅離的鐵路。</p>
<p>全部工程完全以水泥和天然卵石築成，站在蓄水池邊的堰堤上，眺望肥沃的台南平野，使人們不由不贊嘆人工的偉大，配合着電力的分佈，這一帶可以說做到了工業農業化的鄕村，百萬農民的生活，整個台省農村經濟的榮枯和糧食的調配，都繫於斯！</p>
<p>修闢水源</p>
<p>三十四年度的歲入預算是四八，一七六·二四三元，歲出是四八，一七六·二四三元，追加預算歲入二三，一三八·九七〇元，歲出二三，一三八·九七〇元收入部門全部溉租金維特，普通水租每年四二〇元，特別水租一七元，總收入釣八千萬元。三十五年，該組合的修理工程費預定七百八十三萬元，救濟分署等撥災害復舊工程費一千二百八十九萬元，這個修復工程，包括增築堰堤，修理排水路。因爲根據他們的報吿，原定灌溉面積是二百三十萬畝（十五萬甲），可是二十七年實際灌漑的田畝僅爲二日九十餘萬畝，（三十四年的稻作收穫量是三九，二八一·三〇〇斤，平均十五畝可收穫二一〇〇斤）要是這個增築計劃完成以後，該圳的貯水量可增加一一一分之一，可以使缺水的田畝，全部獲得灌漑！</p>
<p>可是我們就合南平野全部面積來看，嘉南大圳所能供給的灌漑田畝，還祇及全部的三分之一，（以三年輪値稻作一次），所以該縣民衆，又要求利用在草嶺地處因大地震而成的貯水池，台南縣政府特別在本年度預算內一五〇萬爲該工事勘査費，並派員駐在管理堰堤，這個天然造成的大貯水池，節省工程費很大，但也正爲天然造成的，含有種種脆弱性，在技術上需要檢討，有待努力之處也還多着！</p>
<p>對於這個大圳，記者頗有感觸，爲什麽內地（甚至是江南）的農由，不能積極生產，一任荒其　和雨早爲災呢？台省的水利工程正是一個殷鑒！</p>

<h3>長春深秋</h3>
<p>— 九日航訊　本報駐瀋訊者趙展</p>
<p>柳條依依，晴空靑靑，　春的深秋還是非常可愛的。不過東北風沙起時，顯示着秋天將要完結，人們就要在長期的寒冷裏冬眠了。</p>
<p>戰爭與和平之間，人們要尋求確切的答案，但問題很不容易答覆。今年冬季來得早，特別是在熱河，氣候已很寒冷，秋高馬肥的氣候不能再被利用；赤峯周圍的戰事正在激烈，南來的士兵已習於冰天雪地中的作戰。國軍要奪取赤峯，肅清熱可境內的共軍，軍方表示這是很容易的工作。共軍在遼北掀起的「星星之火，」有擴大燃燒之勢，作用顯係呼應熱河的烽烟。從張家口往東北經圍塲，赤峯，開魯，北魯到哈爾濱引伸一條綫，把大小戰役連結在一起，東北的今冬大的是不平靜的。松花江水可能靜靜的流，我們大膽推測松花江在相持狀態下凍結。共軍依然作由哈爾濱撤退佳太斯的準備。杜聿明將軍平心靜氣的說：東北是否安定，要看共軍的行動而決定。</p>
<p>打仗毁壞了農村，拉夫抽丁，徵借軍糧，農民在重負壓迫之下呻吟。壯丁離開了農村，農村勞力的缺乏，使糧食產額大减，農民由土地收回的本錢無法和逐日高漲的物價特平衡狀態，這樣便決定了農民的悲苦命運。他們在勝利的秋收後發出慘痛的求教的呼聲。據行總東北分署統計：需要急賑的農民三百萬人，無衣無食的難民十五萬，共軍區域或竟不止此數。今年農民要渡一個絕望的冬天。</p>

<h3>國貨展覽商場開幕</h3>
<p>— 編者</p>
<p>中國生產促進會上海分會等主辦的國貨展覽商塲，已於日前開幕，雖則範圍·陳設，未必能說偉大，和十全十美，但在國貨廠商經營極度困難的今日，能够有這樣一個商場出現，至少可以說是勝利以來的一件盛事。，</p>
<p>對於國貨展覽，在歐美各國，不乏先例，以前英國有英國工業展覽會，德國每年在利必茲也有盛大的展覽會。他們的規模·範圍·以及陳設佈置之精，可以說是每年一度的盛大舉動。</p>
<p>可是在意義上正和道决國貨展鹽商塲相同的。就是要引起國人對於國貨的興趣·信仰·以及認識，從而造成一種心理，就是愛用國貨運動所制定的標語——用國貨，最光榮。</p>
<p>筆者以爲這一次的展覽會，應該具有雙重意義，就是在生產者方面，可以以此爲基點，發揚光大，精益求精。在消費者方面，可以確定消費的方向向把中國人自己的錢，來培養中國人自己的工業，這樣，在產銷兩方的密切合作之下，國貨的前途，將是光明而遠大的。</p>
<h3>工廠地點的研究</h3>
<p>— 嚴炳英</p>
<p>各種工業各有集中於一二地方底趨勢，這是很顯明的，所以美國底紡織和製鞋工業都是馬薩諸塞州（Massachusetts）和羅得島州（Rhode　Island）底著名大工業康涅狄格州（Connecticut）很久的爲銅器業底領袖賓夕法尼亞州（Pennsylvania）爲製毯業底領袖。可是反過來說，工業也可以自一個地方慢慢地遷移到別一個地方，這當然大半是由於人口變動的關係，如美國自從國內發展以後其工業中心，據一九二〇年底戶口調查，就漸漸地向西移動，一直移至印第安納（Inndians）西南部槐特和爾（Whitehall）底附近地方，就是一個例子。除了這種普通的移動趨勢以外，一偭底全部工業也可以因爲種種經濟的情形而自甲處遷至乙處，如幾種本來在新英格蘭各州（New　Sngland　States）發展起來的製造業，現在因爲原料和市塲底經濟關係，使該種工業在西部各州更有利益的緣故，已經差不多要完全離開新英格蘭了。</p>
<p>工廠三需要　市場原料勞</p>
<p>可是此外也有最先發展的幾州，雖然沒有原料，而仍舊能够很穩固地維持幾種工業，並和不但有充足的原料，而几有相同假使不是更好的交通設備，去運輸製造品的各州爲强有力的競爭。如新英格蘭底紡織工業，羅待島底珠寶器業康涅狄格底銅器業都是。所以工業中心在地理上底趨勢，實在是選定工業地點底一個重要原素，凡籌設一種新工業或打算遷移舊工業時都值得對於這種原素注意一下。</p>
<p>以吉普車推動打榖機，（本報特約紐約時報攝寄）</p>
<p>工業之所以集中於某處地方，顯然有許多複雜的原由。而其巾最重要的幾個，就是對於市塲底接近，對於原料底接近，勞動供給底充足，和能力成本底低廉（或因接近瀑布，或因燃料便宜等等）。</p>
<p>在以上各種原因之中，當然以頭兩個最爲重要，因爲沒有原料，物品就製造不成沒有市塲，就是製造沒有用了。此外，在比較狹小的區域裏，這個原因，也常爲選擇工業地點問題底最重要的原素。假使別的條件完全一樣，各種工業底地點，總是要擇於接近市塲的地方，因爲一種工業之所以發生，不是由於市塲有這種需要，就是由於企業家要努力造成這種需要的綠故。其次，原料產地底遠近也常有重大的影響，所以其結果就不得不於兩者之間，求一種調和的解決方法，可是這兩種原素，也常爲運輪問題所左右。臂如有一種原料在製造的時候，大部分都要變成廢料，則假使製造者，要從遠地把這種原料運來，就未免太不合算了。所以有種工業，如須要依靠森林產物的紙業之類，必須設在附近森林的地方包裝業，必須近在牧畜業底中心陶業必須近在有黏土的所在。而反過來說，美國羊毛底產地，雖然都在西部各州，而現在製造毛織物的郤似乎還以在大西洋沿岸來得合算。這都是運輪便利或不便利的關係。又如銅礦一經開採以後，其礦石必須就近礦的地方，溶解出來，因爲這種東西要轉運到遠的地方是辦不到的，但產銅的地方例如蒙大拿（Montana），旣然把銅礦石溶成了銅條之後，他們就可以很經濟的將銅條運至康湼狄格，製成各種器皿，而後又將蒙大拿所需要的銅器重復運國。可是我們也要知道，假使轉運問題在經濟上不甚重要，則市場和原料來源底遠近問題底影響，也就不甚重要，換一句話說，假使轉運費用非常輕徵則最後兩種影響，勞動和能力，或二者中間底任何一個，都可以變成重要的原素，而出品和原料也可以在極大的距離間很經濟地運來運去，而在市塲上佔着優勝的地位了。可是這也是很少的，上列各種原因底任何一個，可以單獨地決定工業底地點，他們常常和其他原因合併而發生影響；所以我們決定工業地點的時候，必定要詳細地研究一番。現在所要知道的，亦不過是勞動和能力這兩種影響，在較大的區域裏，也可以影響以上所述普通原素所定的工業地點罷了。</p>
<p>環境是變動的</p>
<p>大凡發生一種工業的經濟環境每每可以變遷這種情形尤以新發展的國家如美國等，吏爲顯著。所以假使這種變遷比較地巨大，則所發展的工業，也可以受其影響，而遷移至很遠的地方，可是反過來說，各種工業也常常根深蒂固地，在一個地方發榮滋長，雖然該地方底經濟環境，已經很久地不利於該項工業，這些使已發展的工業，長在一個地方的情性，當然由於不少的影響而發生，而其中最重要的一個，成者就是勞動供給。因爲要造成一個工業的社會，必須要經過長久的時間，及至這種社會造成之後，他們就不能像機械一樣，可以很容易地遷移了。即如精練的工人一項，就大概的情形而論非有比較很高的工資，是不肯輕易離開他們底本鄕的即使有了很高的工資，有時他們覺得新環境不大愜意，也很容易失望，而立刻要回去本鄉，所以一種工業，假使在一個地方發榮滋長了，就必定同時發生了一種情性，而不容易遷移。例如新英格蘭有許多工業當初發生的時候都木過是偶然的機會，及至道些工業旣經發展，其他同樣的工業或爲分離，或爲　業，就隨之也發展起來；於是因專門化的作用輔助或附屬的工業也發生了，許多本地資本，也投在裏面了，而這些情性底影響，也就足以抵消其他經濟利益底缺點所以新英格蘭發展這些事業的經濟利益，雖然大部分都已移至他州，而這些事業還是很牢固地在原發祥地佔着領袖的地位。其次，一般人民對於一種工業的信仰也常常趕向於原來發展該業的地方，這當然又是一種增加工業情性的動力。（未完）</p>

<h3>工商管理概論</h3>
<p>— 徐百益</p>
<p>包裝及運輸</p>
<p>生產機構的間題之七</p>
<p>在貨品製造完竣以後，就要考慮到包裝的問題，因爲沒有包裝，決不能出售，也不能運到各處去。</p>
<p>這包裝兩個字，包括兩種包裝；一種是盛裝貨品的包裝，通常稱爲裝璜，裝璜對於貨品的銷售，有極大的關係，因爲牠是貨品的外表，即使貨品的品質很好，但沒有優美的裝璜，在一般人看來，一定要疑惑貨品的質料，終究是不是可靠，所以一般廠商，對於貨品的裝璜，都非常講究，一定要請專家設計。</p>
<p>設計貨品的裝璜，牠的重要，不下於貨品本身的設計，有時候我還可以利用我們的裝璜，來做號召。</p>
<p>除了這裝璜之外，尙須要一層便於運輸的包裝，那就是木箱之類的包裝了。</p>
<p>如果木箱的費用是另外計算的，那末可以不必列入貨品的成本，如果是包括在內而不能另外計算的，那末應該列入貨品的成本。</p>
<p>對於包裝問題，是值得研究的，而且使包裝合於標準，實在可以說是一稱藝術因爲包裝得法，一定要能够符合下列幾個條件：</p>
<p>（一）所裝的貨品，得到充分的保護，可以抵禦運動時一切外來的震動，損害等。</p>
<p>（二）包裝的費用，必須合理，不能過高。</p>
<p>（三）包裝的重量，不能太重，以免增加運輸的費用。</p>
<p>（四）包裝襄面必須有充分襯墊的東西，以免貨品碎破震裂</p>
<p>（五）製造包裝所需的時間，必須愈少愈好。</p>
<p>（六）包裝的尺寸，能够便於運輸，如果幾種貨品，能够採用相仿的包裝，那末更能合乎經濟之道。</p>
<p>一個製造廠，每年用於包裝的費用，非常可觀，所以對於包裝方面，非要研究不可，旣不能爲了減省費用而用不堅固的包裝，也不能單爲了堅固問題而加多貨品的負担，在這裏我們可以把不堅固的包裝和太堅固的包裝的弊病分述如下：</p>
<p>一·不堅固的包裝：</p>
<p>甲·使貨品受到損害。</p>
<p>乙·使貨品在中途缺少散失。</p>
<p>丙·引起主顧的交涉。</p>
<p>丁·信件往返交涉的麻煩。</p>
<p>戊·運輪方面需要更多的時間。</p>
<p>己·退貨的損失．</p>
<p>庚·使帳款延宕不能及時收取。</p>
<p>辛·增加運輸費用．</p>
<p>二·太堅固的包裝。</p>
<p>甲·增加包裝的費用。</p>
<p>乙·因爲所用木質較厚無形中增多地位。</p>
<p>丙·因份量加重而增加運輪的費用。</p>

<h3>販墨記</h3>
<p>— 鮑雨</p>
<p>在某年春天，從屯溪到某一個游擊區工作，因爲要經過淪陷區，怕敵人找麻煩，當時有一位朋友向我建議說：「屯溪的黑墨非常出名，帶一點黑墨在身邊，到了淪陷區，旣可以充一個販墨商，以爲掩護；同時賣給筆墨莊，又可賺一點錢，不無小補。」這個建議，我馬上採納了。</p>
<p>我們都知道徽州「胡開文」的墨是有名的，可是在屯溪街上所見到的墨莊，都掛着「胡開文」的招脾，也像蘇州「陸稿荐」，杭州「張小泉」情形一樣。我當時也無法辨別眞僞，祗選擇了一家招牌字跡比較糢糊的「老胡開文」走進去。</p>
<p>裏面樹窗裏，擺着各式各樣的黑墨，有的像警察手裏的粗黑棍，拴着紅絨線掛在那面；有的像女人畫眉用的細炭條，放在精緻的匣裏，有的塑着玉立亭亭的仕女形，有的塑成的溜滾圓的一塊餅，它們的身上都描繪着金色，或紅綠色的花紋和字，非常好看。</p>
<p>可是這幾種墨，只能做「風雅人」的玩意兒，我不敢買。因爲「風雅人」究竟不多，爲了要顧到銷路起見，結果我只買了十數斤的普通慣用的墨。——這是從路費裏抽出錢來買的。</p>
<p>十數斤的東西，提在一隻無縛鷄之力的手上，感覺到相當吃力，好不容易提上了一艘班船。</p>
<p>離開屯溪十幾里的地方有一個稅卡，船靠了埠，走上來兩個稽査員，他們査到了我十數斤墨，要我的稅栗看，我弄不淸楚，把墨莊給我的發票拿出來。</p>
<p>「這是什麽東西！」頓時把發票擲在船板上。</p>
<p>「我沒有稅票！」</p>
<p>「做生意豈有不納稅，你明明是逃稅，要罰！」稽査員扳下面孔來了。</p>
<p>結果我被罰了一筆款。</p>
<p>從屯溪到場，一路上被查了不少决，已够麻煩了。再從場口到杭州，這一路有着十幾個僞警設的關口，許多惡狠的僞警，一摸我包裏有着重甸甸的東西，一定要我解開包裹。我把包解開，已經把墨露出來了，可是他們還要故意留難，結果非要送錢才能通過。這樣過了十幾個關口，每個關口，都要送錢。到了杭州已經沒有餘剩的路費了。我一方面着急，一方面還存着僥倖之心：只要把墨能够賣出，把價錢稍許提高了一點，那末到目的地的路費，還是可以够的。</p>
<p>這樣一想，就提着墨包在找筆墨莊，一個「處女商人」，羞怯怯地見了筆墨莊，總要在門口徘徊了多時，纔能走進去，等到我一提到有墨要賣時，他們有的說：</p>
<p>「現在不比從前，筆墨的銷路少了，現在差不多的人，用的都是洋鋼筆，洋墨水……」</p>
<p>有的看看我的墨，說一聲；「假胡開文」不說第二句話就走開了。</p>
<p>在杭州街上，走了多少里路，進了好多家筆墨莊，到後來，手裏的墨一錠都沒有少。</p>
<p>在戰時，商人是時代的寵兒，試看誰個做生意不是賺錢的。可是我只買了十幾斤的黑墨，結果非特沒有賣出去，並且因此還要罰款賠錢，窮文人的命運，難道就這樣的苦嗎？—當走過西子湖畔，對着藍色的西子湖我在訴苦。</p>
<p>訴苦不是辦法，我硬着頭皮去找一位平時不願找的親戚，他早年是當敎員的，可是中途改行從商了。</p>
<p>「老兄只知道寫文章，不知道做生意的難呀！哈哈哈……這點墨不過二千塊錢，你還是留着寫文章用吧」！他旣然明白我的遭遇以後，他儘量的譏刺，我有什麽話說呢，我只有痛苦地忍受。</p>
<p>借到一點錢，帶了墨，到達目的地。「雖然生意蝕了本，可是一路上多虧這個「販墨商」的名義，在敵人面前很順利的走過了」，經過這樣一想，心頭比較寬慰些。</p>
<p>以後，我繼續移動了幾個地區，我的墨除掉當禮品送給幾位朋友外，還餘着幾斤在身邊；每次經過陷區時，我總是權充着「販墨商」，這一條條的黑墨倒變做我的護身符了。直到現在雖然事過境遷，但黑墨還有剩餘，在閒暇的時候，把它們拿出來，對着上面題的「蘭烟」「龍門」「五斤油」等等的金字，回想過去的情景，却感到一種說不出的滋味。</p>
<h3>從國畫創作論賀天健山水</h3>
<p>— 施翀鵬</p>
<p>論者謂中國畫幾千年來，千篇一律，絲毫沒有變化，傳移舉寫，一臨再臨，毫無創作精神。這實在寃枉了中國畫，因爲繪畫本身便是人類創作精神的表現，尤其是中國畫。譬如看三代秦漢的繪畫是怎樣一個面目，從何處臨慕而來？晋唐的繪畫是怎樣一個面目，更從何處臨慕而來？五代兩宋以至元代繪畫，又是怎樣一個面目，又從何處臨慕而來？明淸以來的繪畫家，喜歡慕擬古人作品，求其酷肖，他們以爲同樣可以陶性冶情。並且摻雜了崇古意識；久而久之，遂成習氣，於繪畫創作的精神，大爲减退。即如婦孺知名的唐六如，董其昌之流，也是「擬宋元筆意」，或則「師董巨家法」之類的慕仿品，觸目皆是。無怪四王吳憚的作品，馴至沒有一‘幅不是臨慕了！而且總是重江疊嶂，千邱萬　的不二章法，使人看了生厭，要有千篇一律，味同嚼蠟的感覺。雖有少數畫家如八大，石濤，石溪等，可以掃除習氣，充分表現他創作精神，而在當時，並沒有被人注意。</p>
<p>國畫的構圖，無論其爲人物，山水，以至花卉，翎毛，多是運用點和綫的交織而成。人物畫有各種綫條的描法，所謂「鐵綫描」，「游絲描」，「橄攬描」等十八法，山水有「披麻皴」，「解索皴」，「荷葉效」等數十種，花卉有「雙鉤」「沒骨」等方法，這種種方法經過了數千年來，無數畫家的揣慕研究，生在千年以後的現代畫家，當然可以利用參考。利用這種現成的方法，來創作新的繪畫意境，新的筆墨變化，正可以運用每個人的聰明智慧去發揮，去活用。能如此，便是創作，便能另闢「徑」了。所以；八大，石　，也是應用古人的點綫描皴的方法，然後未創作。正和文學的左國史漢之後有韓柳歐蘇的文章，結構雖然同，思想氣度各有不同一樣的意思。</p>
<p>畫家梁溪賀天健先生，他便是利用古人的點綫描皴的方法，而來創造他自己的作品。他曾從五代兩宋元季的作品中，提菁　英，創造力作，在抗戰八年間，屛絕一切酬應，閉門畫畫，積聚了二百多幅的精品，筆者曾經逐一拜讀過。氣魄的偉大，彷彿荊關，邱壑的深遠，依稀范李，筆墨的幽逸，抗衡倪黃，集歷代名家的大成，發現他自已的面目。例如「還我河山」一幀，絹本大靑綠，崇山峻嶺中，描寫勝利凱旋，慶祝還都的意思，民衆歡呼欲在的態度，躍然紙面！尤其男女衣着，手執了靑天白日滿地紅的國旗。這種時代精神，可以信而有徵，至於國畫獨特的點綫描擦的技巧，又是闡發無遺。如此的名畫，才是標準的創作！也便是賀天健先生自已的面目！其他如描寫南北名勝的實景山水很多，淡妝濃抺，氣象萬千，毫無千篇一律的感覺。</p>

<h3>白雲之思</h3>
<p>— 王文標</p>
<p>頗有人以爲秋天多巧雲，而以七七的觀雲，爲一年盛事；其實老天自然不會施什麽花「巧」，彼萬里雲空決不會分四季美醜的。但秋天的天空在晴的時候似乎藍得更深點，襯托出的白雲因之越增其美麗，却是事實。</p>
<p>我以爲雲本身即是一個逗人的東西，由它所引人的意覺是高超的，縹渺的與了無牽掛的輕快之感。說得明白點，世間惟一足以稱得上高貴與純潔便是這個。因之雲也就永遠的被人們作爲消凈，自由，等等一切崇高而超乎世俗之外的象徵。</p>
<p>讀了古人關於雲的詩句，如「但去莫復問，白雲無盡時」，如「有時空望孤雲高」，又如「岸上無心雲相遂」而覺深具世外之想，頗足尋味。這裏固然一半有不得已的太息在內，另外，我覺得也惟有多感的詩人能愛好白雲，而引爲衷心的冥想與忘憂的寄託。譬如，前者的詩意中，明知是被想像爲超人間的「意境」，也許這種感覺有些兒「可笑」，而以爲詩人的眞個「痴絕」，但我們却有不可免的同感，這同感是當我們在心灰意嫩的，而覺得「世事不可爲」的時候自然地流露了。</p>
<p>因此有一個感覺，老荘想的出點處亦頗有與雲的意覺相關，如崔　的黃鶴樓詩中「白雲千載空悠悠」一句可以概見，蓋「千載」云云示歷劫不變的意思，與李白「只今惟有西江月，曾照吳王宮裏人」的看月同一意思，亦同一的顯出「老冉冉其將至」的人生之缺憾。（李商隱「夕陽無限好，只是近黃昏」可發明上意）「空悠悠」三字則可比老莊裏的「元牝」，「太淸」，「虛無」之境，而爲人心裏永遠的「神思」。所以老子中的「衆妙之門」句正可解釋作與「悠悠」有怎樣情味。</p>
<p>這樣一說，便可明白何以普天下的失意者，與多感的詩人愛起雲來的理由了。寒齋有一幅王東莊山水圖，其題詩末句云「結個茅庵何處好，丹林黃葉白雲間」，乃益覺更深設想矣。此外有隨了境遇不同而比擬其感覺的，如李白「浮雲游子意」句，寫出了作客他鄕時的情思；又岑參「愁雲慘　萬里凝」，細味其景，已令人有萬感交集（，悲不能已，——或竟是「英雄末路」時的情景呢。</p>
<p>曾說看雲不必在秋天，但吾却深感惟有帶有三分凉意的秋之野，可以好好地享受那些飄浮的白雲。——是的，藍的天空，點綴了軟似棉絮般隨風飄浮的白雲，看了會給予人如何的遐想的！</p>

<h3>一寸山河一寸血　　68</h3>
<p>— 葉勁風</p>
<p>我同虎弟，在這一家盤桓了的莫一小時，聽了一個悲慘的故事：</p>
<p>翠姐姑計，叫翠和，父親原是通縣有名的大富商。自從股汝耕逆賊供奉着日寇，在城裏作威作福，城裏城外，以及隣近的鄉村，頓時變成了一個黑暗的地獄，那種慘狀，同淪陷後的潘陽，一模一樣；富的窮了，壯年不被徵役，就成了睹和毒品的犧牲者；要不就是無端失了踪影。女的，祗要是女的，少有不被躁躪，甚或運到大連，營口，台北等地去當營妓。翠姐的父親本想趁時閑家逃到北平，走慢了一步，就被殷逆手下的爪牙抓去，硬生加上一個罪名，財產充公不算，人還死在黑牢裏。</p>
<p>翠姐那時才十五歲，一個淸潔高尙的女學生，却被一羣小奸，連她母親一同逮去，獻給一個日　，叫什麼松崗玉田太郎。一年多後，那東西被調遣走開，就將母女二人轉送給手下的一名特工；說是中國種，其實是高麗棒子。直到現在，就把母女安置在道裏，高起興來就來一宿；不高興，他的公館有十幾處，哪兒都隨便消遣。</p>
<p>翠和母女爲什麽不走開呢？據翠姐說，也曾試過一兩次，無奈婦女胆小，性弱，親戚都遭着同樣的命運，又無處投奔。他們爪牙甚多，走不了幾步，就被抓回。抓回之後，就要受一頓鞭扑，還要烙上幾個火印。她們母女，腿上和背上，都烙滿「高田」兩個字，和些「井」形的花格。據說她的表姐，性情燥烈，他們就强制給她扎嗎啡針，讓她上癮；現在已成了一個人乾，就在軍營裏鬼混。</p>
<p>翠姐和她母親，勸我們千萬不能上城裏去，因爲那地方，一去就難得原形原樣出來。她們說在雙橋的東北，通縣的西北，而地處叉點，那裏有一個更可怕的魔窟。無論在北平或天津，或附近各鄕鎭，凡是擄來的婦女，就先送到那裏幽禁，直到變成一個妓女，或人乾，或惡魔鬼倀；否則就是一堆灰燼，要是性子烈的話。擄來的富人，或捕來的「反抗」份子，也是往那裏一送，要想逃出性命，除非依了條件，否則縱然生了翅膀，怕也飛不出來。</p>
<p>聽她母女說，那地方雖不曾去過，却知道那裏有飛機塲，有軍營，有寨子，四面幾里都有兵把住，防衛森　周密。除了日寇，韓人，台人，殷逆手下的死黨等等之外，只有一種人可以進去得，——出家的和尙——那是因爲日寇漢奸都作孽太甚，恐遭天譴，所以常常要請些和尙去念經誦佛，替他們懺悔。</p>
<p>咱們幾時得開上這鬼寨裏去探探，好不好，小姨？」虎弟同我離開翠姐家裏，路上走着的時候，這麽問我。</p>
<p>我也想去試試，只想不出安全的辦法。還有一個困難問題，那就是明去，還是偷着去。照規矩我們應該報吿隊長，他允許去就可去，不然就不能去。我把這話吿訴了虎弟。</p>
<p>虎弟照他似乎挺拘謹，人也只有十二三歲，可是你看他前腦突出那麼多，後腦杓子那麼大，無論如何，是個刁鑽調皮的脚色。他一聽我提出這兩點，却是滿有主意；關於去的方法，他說可請翠姐母女指點一個熱廟，我們就冒充那廟裏的掛單和尙。關於隊長方面，暫時可不能報吿，他預料假使報告了，準不能去，決不能讓我們去冒這麼大險，只能矇着頭去。回來之後，就說咱們追賊追進去了，或是被鬼子逼得去了，設法逃出來的。</p>
<p>我當時雖然贊成這個辦法，可沒有答應去，只吿訴虎弟，讓我想想再看。我們一路向通縣這裏走着，雖然碰見幾部汽車，坐了些鬼子，漢奸，狗黨們，可是我們沒讓他們看見，早適開了，所以一路無事。早午十點多，就上這兒來報到了。</p>

<p>當政府政協代表，共產黨代表，以及第三方面人士連日往返商談時，其會談的地點，就頗令我們樂觀。比如，吳鐵城公館叫「望盧」，表示有希望；張君勱的寓所叫「範園」，表示會談有了範圍，有規範可循了；周恩來住處在思南路，說明他人雖在上海，心却思南京。用地名來印證目前的現實情勢，不能不說是一個巧合。</p>
<p>勝利業已週年，我們還在閙意氣，停談，談停，談停談地也拖了一年，讓人家訕笑還在其决，自己的建國大事却躭誤了，那才萬分痛心哩！而今，望廬，範園，思南路傳出來的笑聲，將是我們老百姓全體大笑的開始，願以上三地成爲我們建國史上的不朽的地名。</p>

<h3>法官是誰</h3>
<p>— 春良譯</p>
<p>在芝加哥的法院中，有一個法官，一個檢察官，和一個書記官，他們的名字是羅賓遜，施密斯，瓊史；那名單是不按次序的。有三個出庭的律師也名叫羅賓遜，施密斯，瓊史。</p>
<p>我們想知道那法官叫甚么名字？下面是一些我們所打探出來的消息。由那些消息中，你能否找出答案來？</p>
<p>（一）書記官是和那個住在芝加哥的律師同名的。</p>
<p>（二）書記官所賺得的進益，三倍於他的鄰居，三個律師中之一。</p>
<p>（三）施密斯（不是律師）有一次在門草比賽中，戰勝了那檢察官。</p>
<p>（四）羅賓遜先生，其中的一個律師，住在罷林頓的地方。</p>
<p>（五）書記官每年可賺一萬五千元美金。</p>
<p>（六）書記官住在芝加哥和罷林頓之間。</p>
<p>（七）律師，瓊史先生，每年可謙六千元美金。</p>
<p>法官到底叫什麼名字？</p>
<p>（按：在看答案之前，最好先用用自己的腦筋，試一考騐你的智慧！）</p>
<h3>答案</h3>
<p>（甲）：一個律師住在芝加哥（根據一）；一個律師，羅賓遜先生，住在罷林頓，（根據四）；書記官住在芝加哥和罷林頓之間（根據六），他的鄰居是一個律師，因此那第三個律師，（或是施密斯，或是瓊史）也住在芝加哥和罷林頓之間。</p>
<p>（乙）：書記官每年賺一萬五千元美金（根據五），也可以說三倍於他的律師的鄰居，（根據。），因爲律師瓊史先生每年賺六千元美金，他不可能是那個鄰居的律師（根據二）因此，他一定是住在芝加哥或是罷林頓的地方，但是羅賓遜先生住在罷林頓（根據四），所以　史一定是住在芝加哥。（一）於是，餘下來的施密斯先生，就是那鄰居。</p>
<p>（丙）：因爲瓊史先生住在芝加哥，書記官的名字一定是瓊史，（根據一）</p>
<p>（丁）：檢察官的名字不會是施密斯，因爲施密斯在比賽中戰勝過他（根據三）這樣，檢察官的名字一定是瓊史，或是羅賓遜，但是，根據上述的（丙），他不會是瓊史，所以，他一定是羅賓遜。</p>
<p>（戊）：因爲，根據上述的丙，書記官的名字叫瓊史，根據上述的丁，檢察官的名字叫羅賓遜，所以那法官的名字一定叫施密斯。</p>
<p>法官是施密斯，對嗎？</p>

<h3>后生可畏</h3>
<p>— 葛春良譯　　詳自十月份讀者文摘</p>
<p>要錢的技巧</p>
<p>汽車駛過仙南渡的山谷時，我們（一群美國兵士）在一個高邱上欣賞美景　。我　起先一些也沒有注意到　旁的一個水　　，因爲這一類的攤頭、我們已經經過了很多的了，直等到一個十二歲的「小老　」走過來，借給了我們一對　遠鏡時，才注意。他一面替他們指出來那些比較有趣，比較美麗的風景，一面選擇了幾個他的水菓給我們吃。當我們吃完了問他多少錢的時候，他很快地回答，「不必付錢，沒有關係的，這些水菓是免費的，我喜歡指點人家此地的風景，那是多麽美麗呀——」說着，他自管自的眺望著滿是光輝的山谷。</p>
<p>後來，我們決定每人給他一個兩角半的銀角子，同時，我問他了，「爲什麽別人的　頭都在出賣著他們的水菓，可是你却在免費地贈　人呀？」他把銀角子放進了袋中，狡猾地一笑,說：「因爲我的收人比他們多呀！」</p>
<p>「勞心者治人」</p>
<p>我（一個主婦）想把我的天井去鏟好，做一個花園，但是我猶豫着是否還是叫我十二歲的兒子去做這工作，因爲土地上充滿著瓦礫碎石，並且而積也很廣大。『我願付出五元美金來，叫人把天幷鏟好。』我挑逗地說。</p>
<p>「把五元錢省下來給我，媽！」他要求著說：『今天晚上以前,這件工作就可以做好的•』</p>
<p>這天下午，我聽見外面許多呼喊聲和大笑聲。大約有二十個男孩子們拿著鏟刀，用　所有的氣力，拼命地掘著，並且明顯地都很高興。『花園在幾分鐘內就可以完工了，』我的兒子跑來對我說。他看來對他自已很驕傲，我知道他連一鏟也沒有　過。「你是怎么做的呀？』我問。</p>
<p>『噢！我不過召集了一個比賽。我把土地劃分成二十小塊，誰能掘得最好，並且最快的完工，那麼那個人就可以得到獎金一塊錢。這樣，我就可以賺四塊錢，怎麼說？媽，錢呢？」</p>
<h3>臥車</h3>
<p>— 癡墨</p>
<p>最近嘉興車在嘉善站發生了一次「臥車」的慘劇。</p>
<p>這不是人力所不能抵抗的天災，要是時常來往於滬杭間的老出門旅客，車子停在嘉善站時，諒必總覺得該處一帶路軌或許因枕木腐蝕失修而低陷，以致車身失了平衡而顯得左右不平，斜傾如順風之舟，因此出軌是在情理之中，所幸是徐徐躺下，旅客生命尙不致於似覆巢之卵。</p>
<p>尙有莘莊站一帶的路軌，亦復如是，願當局未雨綢繆，防患未然，則旅客幸甚。否則「臥車」之慘劇將接踵而起矣。</p>
<h3>關於說話</h3>
<p>— ww</p>
<p>第一流善言的人，能做到談言微中，可以解紛，他們的話，往往適可而止，關子賣住，對方似乎給搔着接處。</p>
<p>次焉者擅於掉槍花，指東話西，欲擒故縱，話裏有因，不着邊際，弄得對方動火不得，强顏爲笑，莫可如何。</p>
<p>末流的不是夜郎，便是長舌，東長西短，張冠李戴，開口莫動手，儘笑勿動氣，姑妄言之，姑妄聽之，　舌也好，造謠也好，言者有意，聽者無心。</p>
<p>戰前大家還覺得可以「說不要話」，不要緊的，可以說說；淪陷期中上海人頓覺得「不要說話」，某人好意勸人：「多吃飯少開口！」却給敵憲罰他多吃飯，多得就此喪生；勝利後黨派太多，使人又有「要說話不？」的感覺，大家都說和平，而浩劫不斷演出，言論儘管自由，然亦多此一說，成了自說自話的局面。</p>
<p>有人說「閒話一多，人變猪　！」也有人說「言多必失」「禍從口出，」變猪玀倒是小事，禍患之來令人不寒而慄，如此看來，的確有少說的必要。</p>
<p>呆子說話，往往一股牛氣，不大中聽；不像會說會話的人，瞇著眼睛，儘管口蜜腹劍，還是娓娓動聽。</p>
<p>朋友，別氣餒！人言爲信，只要說眞話，縱使千人的指觸着你的額角，骨　在喉，總得要吐出來的！</p>
<h3>一個黑色產婦，一胎四兒</h3>
<h3>五彩幣誕生聲中　且談鈔票的成長</h3>
<p>— 接青</p>
<p>報載五彩鈔票將在我國出現，因爲聯總已將美國新式的四色印鈔機一部，運抵我國。該機可以一次印出繽紛絢麗，四種顏色的紙幣•無疑的，這將成爲我國貨幣史上，一個劃時代的改革。</p>
<p>筆者趁這個機會，把我國貨幣的沿革經過，零星一述：</p>
<p>純粹作爲交易媒介物的最早的古錢，稱爲「古布」，形狀像一柄鏟子，因此也稱「鏟布」，開始鑄造的年代，以周朝初年爲可靠。</p>
<p>周初流行的錢幣有布，泉，圓法和刀四種。我們見到的圓形中有方孔的制錢，即屬於圓法。</p>
<p>妾太公在周初發行圓法，上刋「實貨」兩字，後世仿照，所以中國歷代的制錢，上面都刻有「寶」字。</p>
<p>至於我國的紙幣，行使已久，宋代的交子，會子，金國的交鈔，元朝的絲鈔，明代的寶鈔，都　鈔票性質。</p>
<p>海外的傳說，則認爲世界上第一個以鈔票作爲貨幣的國君是奧地利的國王佛蘭西斯•約瑟夫。當也最初下令民間使用鈔票時，人民彷彿以爲到了世界末日，他們見慣金銀珠寶，看不中那種紙幣。所以由奧國政府下令，頒佈一條嚴厲的法律，製造僞鈔者，一律處死。鈔票方才得以流用民間。</p>
<p>我國的銀幣，起先祗有外幣流人，以西班牙銀元爲最早，的在十六世紀中葉，已由西班牙人從菲列濱帶至我國。</p>
<p>繼西班牙銀幣之後，墨西哥的「鷹洋，」在一八五四年開始流入我國，各地風行。</p>
<p>我國自鑄銀幣，始自光緒十三年（西曆一八八七年），名日龍洋，最先交由廣東省試鑄。</p>
<p>銅元在中國，歷史並不甚久，直到甲午戰後，始由淸政府大量鑄造，銅元一出，制錢遂爲淘汰。</p>
<p>淸代所鑄銅元，約有百數十種，民國以後，各省各地所造銅幣，合計也有百種之多。</p>
<p>抗戰期間，以物資缺乏，不得不採用一紙一版方法，致流行市面的鈔票種類繁多，名稱不一。印刷不精，紙張欠佳，輾轉授受，便成敗絮。今日抗戰已告勝利，丞應設法使其簡化　一。希望能夠盡量收回劣質的紙幣，代以美觀悅目，五彩鮮艷的新鈔票。</p>

<p>遭遇坎坷的君主，歷史上多的是；可是要想舉出一個像希王喬治二世那樣的往例，却是很困難的了。他三次遜位出國，又三次回本國去當元首。出國對於他像習慣似的平常，總計他耗費在外國旅館中當寓公的光陰，的有二十年。現在他是五十六歲的人了，不多久舉行的全民投票贊成君主立　，結果又把他回國去。不過，地處南方的希臘國民之易感善變，加周圍列强的，挑撥煽動，其政局極不穩定。看情勢，喬治二世還可能傀儡似的，再來幾次遜位登基的把戲。我們一方面爲希臘嘆息，同時也不禁爲同病相憐的祖國悼惜起來。</p>
<p>一九一七年，協約國的諸巨頭，使用壓力，迫令喬治的父親君士坦丁遜位，王位由後者的小兒予，亞力山大繼承，實權則全由受協約國信任的凡尼眞羅（Venizelus）所掌握。至於身爲　太子的喬治二世、則爲協約國排除，原因由於他曾以凱撤姪兒的資格，在普魯士國防軍某聯隊服務數年。實際上，這個原因並不能構成他親德的理由，相反的，喬治二世時常對人説，積數年在普魯士國防軍中服務的經騐，對於德國軍人頗抱反感。</p>
<p>他的第一次登基是在他小兄弟亞力由大猝死，並其父君士坦丁再度遜位之後，，不料不到兩年，希民又要求民主，這一次他出國到英倫去。</p>
<p>清淡的生活</p>
<p>他的第二度寓公生活，過得像他曾祖丹麥人一樣樸素（一）兩間舒適的旅館房間標代皇宮。他時常跑舊書攤，去瀏覽或購買他愛好的歷史書籍，有時我們可以遇到他在爲一座藝術走廊或劇院舉行揭幕禮。間或渡海峽到巴黎去同他的黨徒會晤。這時，他就在他叔父喬治家裏過夜。</p>
<p>一九三五年的一次全民投票，又把他請回到本國去，這一次倒是由他竭力的束保皇黨從的在熱，才使全民投票得以順利進行。登基後，軍事大權操諸梅特薩斯（Metaxas）手中，這位在普魯士軍校學成的梅特薩斯將軍，出乎意料，曾在一九四一年，堅決與軸心國作戰，於是希王的困苦生涯又吿展開。</p>
<p>希臘本土全部被佔領後，喬治和幾個親信流浪到希臘之南的克里特島，最後數天，在軸心軍追逼之下，他祗得躱到冰天雪地的山嶺裏去。忠心的鄕下人，倫倫摸摸地供給他們食物和居處，以冰雪溶化成的水解渴，晚上則躲避在冰凍的木屋裏。當他最後抵逹海岸，遙見尋覓他的英軍時，揮搖火炬　小時，才爲英軍發覺送到安全的所在。他到了倫敦後，即刻進行他的任務，希臘的數個軍政單位開始在近建立起來，希臘的海軍也開始與聯合國海軍並肩作戰。這一次可不像第二次當寓公時的寒酸了，總部建立在卡立琪（Caridge）大旅館中，繁華的倫敦人設備，較之本國的皇宮並無多大遜色；另有好多個軍官做他的副官。但是宮中的繁文縟節可不能再邀守了；在餐廳裏，他的鄰桌可能坐着南斯拉夫的國王與王后，或任何一個流浪君主，但是也可能坐着一個普通旅客，一點也不猜疑到這身穿裁製適身的藍色制服的喬治，不是一個休假的海軍士官，而是希臘的君主！不過喬治是個不拘俗禮的君主，這一切對他也無所謂。</p>
<p>反軸心有功</p>
<p>在這戰爭期間，他很少有空閒的時光，他要到美國去爲他本國辯護，又須組織希臘軍民使參加對軸心作戰，這次希臘的得以復國，喬治二世實有不可磨滅的功勞。</p>
<p>今年他又與希臘的執政份子發生　　，終於第三度的遜位出國，直至最近全民投票贊成君主立憲政體爲止</p>
<p>對於喬治二世應該作怎樣的評價呢？他謹愼，冷靜，有旁觀者的目光，沒有將新的責任　到自己身上來的野心和慾望。這最後一點—與世無爭的態度—固然是一種高尙的品德，但也是一種懦弱無能的表示，結果是本人只能傀儡式地遜位登基，對於希臘本國，則不能使它超脫於列强影饗之上。</p>

<h3>Representatives From All Sides Left Shanghai This Morning; Peace Talks Move to Nanjing to Continue; President Sun Exchanges Opinions After Luncheon</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Yesterday, the representatives from the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and the Third Force were all preparing to go to Nanjing, and were scheduled to gather at Longhua Airport at 8:30 this morning. CCP spokesperson Chen Jiakang made a statement saying: "Since the government occupied Zhangjiakou on the 11th and simultaneously announced the convening of the National Assembly, the door to peace negotiations has been closed, and the danger of a complete breakdown is imminent. At this time, the task of saving China still needs to be resolved by the Chinese people themselves. Apart from the Kuomintang (KMT) and the CCP, representatives from various parties and non-partisan figures, with the spirit of 'treating a dead horse as if it were alive,' are appealing and running around for democracy and peace, with compassion and empathy, which is truly touching and admirable. This is why the negotiations have been reopened. Because of this, the informal discussions held in Shanghai in the past two days were limited to exchanging opinions and identifying problems, and therefore no conclusions were reached. Now, for the sake of practical convenience, it is decided to move these negotiations to Nanjing on the 21st. The Chinese Communist Party is saving China, which is on the verge of division, as if saving a critically ill mother. If there is a glimmer of hope, we will do our best. However, the key to success or failure still lies in the hands of the government. The CCP is willing to follow the representatives of various parties, social leaders, and the people of the whole country in making concerted efforts to strive for it."</p>
<p>Those going to Nanjing from the CCP side include Mr. Zhou Enlai and eight staff members; representatives from the Third Force include Zeng Qi, Chen Qitian, Zuo Shunsheng, Yang Yongjun, Yu Jiaju, and Li Huang from the Youth Party; Zhang Junmai, Luo Longji, Shen Junru, Huang Yanpei, Zhang Bojun, and Jiang Yuntian from the Democratic League; and social leaders Hu Zhengzhi and Guo Moruo.</p>
<p>Yesterday, reporters interviewed several representatives separately. Their combined opinions are as follows: (1) In any case, "talking" is better than "not talking"; (2) Although there is a distance between the opinions of the two sides, there is still a possibility of rapprochement; (3) Some representatives are quite concerned about the development of the Beiping Military Conference, believing that it may affect the prospects for a ceasefire; (4) This meeting is bound to be the most important of all previous negotiations, and we are willing to do our best to make it a success.</p>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Mr. Zhang Shou, Secretary of the Central Party Headquarters, who is responsible for taking care of the CCP and Third Force representatives' trip to Nanjing, has already flown back to Shanghai yesterday. According to reports, he has chartered a China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) plane. The CCP representatives had contacted Marshal Ma yesterday to send a plane to Shanghai to take them to Nanjing, but it had not arrived as of last night. If the plane sent by Marshal Ma arrives in Shanghai before 8:00 this morning, the CCP representatives will take off from Jiangwan Airport; otherwise, they will take the CNAC plane to Nanjing with the Third Force representatives.</p>
<p>[Dispatch from Nanjing, 20th] Wu Tiecheng and Shao Lizi, representatives of the Political Consultative Conference (PCC) government, returned to Nanjing from Shanghai at 8:30 a.m. on the 20th. The two were ordered on the 17th to go to Shanghai to urge representatives of various parties to come to Nanjing to participate in the consultations. After contacting and working hard in Shanghai, good news reached the capital yesterday afternoon, and people from all walks of life have placed boundless hopes on it. This morning, reporters rushed to Xiaguan before 7:00 to greet them. The train was delayed for about an hour due to some reasons. At 8:30, as soon as the train arrived at the station, reporters boarded the last special car and met with the hardworking Wu and Shao. Shao, dressed in a long robe and mandarin jacket, looked tired. He first said to Lei Zhen, the Secretary-General of the PCC, and the reporters who came to greet him, "Thank you for waiting so long." When reporters asked how he slept on the train, Shao replied, "One quilt was too cold, and two quilts were too hot. I didn't sleep well." But when the topic of peace talks was mentioned, both of them expressed great joy. Wu immediately made the following statement to reporters next to the carriage: "The representatives of various parties and social leaders and PCC representatives who stayed in Shanghai will take a special plane back to Nanjing on the morning of the 21st to discuss everything. As for the meeting format, it will naturally follow the informal five-person small group meeting, the military three-person small group meeting, the constitutional draft review committee, and the PCC comprehensive group. However, people from the Third Force still suggest exchanging more opinions outside the meeting to help the meeting proceed."</p>
<h3>Wu and Shao Report on the Situation in Shanghai; President Chiang Expresses Gratification; Also Instructs Representatives to Welcome on Behalf of the Government</h3>
<p>They then got off the train and returned to their residences at 8:45 a.m. After a short rest, they went to see the President at 9:00 a.m. to report on the negotiations in Shanghai. The President was very pleased after listening to the report, and instructed the two to welcome the representatives coming to Nanjing on behalf of the government. At nearly 10:00 a.m., the two rushed back to Wu's private residence and met with reporters. At 11:00 a.m., they went to Sun Ke's residence to report everything to the PCC government representatives. Wang Shijie, Chen Bulei, Wu Dingchang, Chen Lifu, and others arrived. In the evening, reporters visited Shao again. Shao said with a more pleasant expression that their trip to Shanghai was to invite representatives from all sides to return to Nanjing to break the deadlock in the negotiations. Now that this mission has been accomplished, the representatives will come to Nanjing on the 21st to continue the peace talks. However, the future cannot be said to be without difficulties. He still hopes that all parties can respect the national interest and sacrifice their personal prejudices to achieve the goal of true peace and unity, and hopes that everyone will work together. When reporters asked if the three-person meeting and the five-person meeting could be held on the 21st, Shao said that on the 21st, they would first exchange opinions informally outside the meeting. At noon, Sun Ke will host a banquet at the Lixingshe, inviting dozens of PCC representatives from Shanghai and Nanjing, and after the meal, they will conduct out-of-session discussions and may pay a visit to the President.</p>

<h3>Situ Meitang Calls for Peace</h3>
<p>[Dispatch from the Central News Agency, Nanjing, 20th] Situ Meitang, chairman of the Minzhi Party, issued his views on the current situation today, calling for peace. He expressed his deep joy at the representatives of various parties coming to Nanjing to resume negotiations, believing that a bright future is in sight. Although there may be different political views among them, they must not resort to force, but should resolve conflicts invisibly through mediation. They should be open and honest and abandon prejudices, and should not use negotiations as a means of delay or meetings as a decoration for peace. He believes that the government will definitely adopt a lenient and tolerant attitude towards the Communists in the future peace talks, and the Communists will also give up force and work together hand in hand.</p>

<h3>Zhangjiakou Provisional Political Council to Maintain General Administration</h3>
<p>Thousands of Communist Party Members Surrender</p>
<p>[Dispatch from the Central News Agency, Zhangjiakou, 19th] The Zhangjiakou Provisional Political Affairs Committee, organized by the 11th War Zone and headed by Zhou Jun, Deputy Director of the Political Department, is responsible for maintaining general administration. Under it is the Military-Civilian Cooperation Council, which is an organization for the National Army to connect with the people. The Provisional Political Affairs Committee is divided into four groups, responsible for general affairs, personnel, foreign affairs, propaganda, culture, Baojia (household registration system), civil affairs, public training, materials and economy, and reception and custody. According to Zhou, the Political Affairs Committee has done the following: (1) Pacifying the people and protecting foreigners. There are currently 108 Soviet nationals. Commander Fu issued 2 million legal currency and 50 bags of flour. There are 4 Norwegians, 1 Belgian (a Catholic priest), and 1 Finn. Each person was issued 20,000 legal currency and every two people one bag of flour. (2) "Border currency" is no longer used. Because the Communist Army issued an additional 1,000-yuan note when they retreated, disrupting the financial system. After entering the city, the people stopped using it on their own. Before the government issued instructions, it had temporarily lent 20 million legal currency to the Chamber of Commerce and printed 5 million small notes. (3) Alleviating the hatred among the people caused by the Communist Army. (4) Rewarding people for collecting guns, selling each one for 100,000 yuan. More than 100 guns have been recovered.

However, according to Secretary-General Wang Mingde, 35% of this year's harvest goes to the tiller, 25% to the weeder, 25% to the harvester, and 15% to the landlord.</p>

<h3>No Science, No National Defense; President Chiang's Two-Point Instruction to the Academia Sinica Council; Hope to Catch Up and Keep Pace with All Countries</h3>
<p>[Dispatch from the Central News Agency, Nanjing, 20th] At the opening of the Academia Sinica Council, President Chiang specially issued the following full text of his instruction: During the War of Resistance, the Academia Sinica held its Second Session of the Second Council, which has been two years ago. The progress of world academics has never stopped, and the need for national defense construction is even more urgent. The Academia Sinica is convening the Third Council at this time of victory and return to the capital, which has profound significance. I would like to tell the gentlemen present here two things: Since the beginning of the War of Resistance in the 26th year (1937), the Academia Sinica moved west with the government and experienced hardship and difficulty. The people in the Academia Sinica were able to cultivate their ambitions and work diligently. The council was also re-elected once and held two meetings, which promoted all business and made important suggestions to the government. Their steadfastness and loyalty are worthy of emulation, and I should express my appreciation to you for this. I always show the Chinese people the meaning of "No Science, No National Defense." In view of the reasons for the victory or defeat of this World War, the importance of scientific research can be further proved. As the only academic research institution in the capital, the Academia Sinica has to jointly shoulder the mission of promoting academic research cooperation and mutual assistance at home and abroad. How to strengthen our country's academic research in the future, especially for the latest inventions in international science, how to strive to explore them in order to catch up with advanced countries, all depend on your consistent efforts and a quick catch-up. This is my earnest hope for you. Building a nation is based on academics. All the gentlemen present are academic experts in the country. Gathering wisdom and deliberating carefully, there will definitely be concrete plans to meet the needs of the times. The task is arduous and the road is long. The hearts of kind people and new scholars should explore the origin and investigate the principles of things in order to make contributions that are practical and innovative, increase national power, promote national glory, and be beneficial.</p>
<h3>The Era of "Human Bullet" and Broadsword is Over: Scientific Advancement Determines Victory in War - Minister Bai Stresses the Importance of National Defense Science</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Dispatch from Nanjing, 20th] Minister Bai Chongxi, in his address at the opening ceremony of the Central Research Institute's Council meeting on the 20th, eloquently discussed the importance of national defense science, hoping that scientists nationwide could collaborate with the Ministry of National Defense. Bai elaborated on President Chiang's instruction: "Without science, there is no national defense, and without national defense, there is no nation." The importance of science is thus evident. Recognizing this, one of the special characteristics of the Ministry of National Defense's organization is its emphasis on science. Two percent of the Ministry of National Defense's budget will be used for scientific research. From the perspective of science itself, its ultimate goal should be to benefit humanity. Regrettably, some ambitious individuals in the world have used science as a tool of war to destroy culture. Our emphasis on science is solely for self-defense and to maintain world peace, which is essential in the current stage. Bai cited examples of wars where science played a crucial role, proving that those with advanced science often achieve victory. Modern warfare, in particular, is determined by the level of scientific advancement, as this period is indeed a war of science, technology, and equipment. In the early stages of the War of Resistance, our country suffered setbacks, for which military personnel should bear responsibility, but scientists also bear a portion of the responsibility. The era of "human bullets" and broadswords is over. What determines victory is not the size of the population but the superiority of science. During the late stages of the War of Resistance, we were able to transition to an offensive and turn defeat into victory with the assistance of allied equipment, which serves as evidence. Bai resolutely stated: We do not hope for future wars, but we must prepare for them early. Our country's scientific foundation is inherently inferior to others, so we must catch up and make efforts that transcend the times. He also stated: Future wars will be sudden, destructive, and all-encompassing; therefore, peacetime and wartime should not be separated. We cannot wait until after mobilization to fight. Bai discussed the scientific research work undertaken by the Ministry of National Defense, stating: The Ministry of National Defense currently has several scientific research institutions and will send special talents abroad for advanced studies. Internationally, we will also seek to connect with friendly nations and recruit foreign scientists for our use. The scientific knowledge of officers and soldiers in the army, navy, and air force nationwide will also be utilized. However, in recent decades, we have relied heavily on foreigners, and what we have gained is only superficial. For example, after Prussia won the Franco-Prussian War, we copied the Prussian drill manual verbatim. When Japan won the Russo-Japanese War, we completely copied the Japanese drill manual. Now that both shoulder-carrying methods have failed, we are at a loss. This shows the fallacy of blindly copying. He hopes that scientists can cooperate with the Ministry of National Defense and work together.</p>
<h3>The Speed of Scientific Advancement in the World is Astonishing; Our Survival is Already Threatened - Zhu Jiahua's Opening Remarks</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 20th] In the opening ceremony of the Central Research Institute's Council meeting, Zhu Jiahua delivered the opening remarks, stating: The Central Research Institute is deeply pleased and honored to return to the capital for the second session of the third council annual meeting. It is a pity that the founder of this institute, former President Cai, who was also the former chairman of this council, passed away during the War of Resistance. We cannot receive his leadership today, which is the greatest regret. While we remember him, we should work harder to achieve the expectations that Mr. Cai placed on this institute. This institute is the highest academic institution in the country. During the War of Resistance, we were subjected to enemy blockades, and domestic transportation was inconvenient. We could not only not replenish equipment, but also international cooperation and connections were extremely difficult. It can be said that we could not fully fulfill our responsibilities. In addition, due to the hardships of materials, all work could not maintain constant progress. However, scholars across the country have continued to concentrate on research, and national academic progress is still considerable. The establishment of the Institute of Zoology and Botany and the planning of the Institutes of Mathematics and Medicine were all realized during this period. Research on the high-altitude ionosphere is beginning to take shape. This spirit should be continued. However, our academic research foundation is shallow, and the astonishing speed of scientific progress in the world during the war has made us unable to catch up. The international status of the entire nation, and even the issue of survival, has made us feel seriously threatened. Although the people of our country have been advocating Western academics for a long time, and the government, since establishing the capital in Nanjing, especially during the War of Resistance, has repeatedly emphasized the promotion of science, the results are limited. Recently, the Supreme National Defense Council resolved that the percentage of national budget allocated to scientific research will increase. After this practical and concrete resolution, an important stage will certainly be produced in the history of Chinese scientific research. Then, the resolutions of previous meetings of this council will have the opportunity to be implemented, which is worth celebrating.</p>
<h3>Nation-Building Depends on Science; Establishing the Nation Emphasizes Culture Even More</h3>
<p>Wu Tiecheng Describes the Path Forward</p>
<p>Secretary-General Wu Tiecheng addressed the Council meeting, stating: Examining past history, the development of academic culture has been no more than two paths: one is the emergence of genius, and the other is the demands of the times. The invention of the compass and the armillary sphere are examples of this, which also shows that our country's academic culture has a brilliant and bright history. Furthermore, in the contemporary world, Mr. Weng Wenhao, Mr. Zhu Kezhen, and Mr. Hua Luogeng have all made outstanding achievements in geology, meteorology, and mathematics, which are valued by the world's academic community. Nation-building depends on academics, and establishing the nation emphasizes culture even more. If we want to catch up with European and American academic culture and build a prosperous and happy nation, we must bravely advance along the following paths: First, the foundation of culture lies in academics, and the progress of academics lies in research. Therefore, if we want to develop culture, we must be led forward by the Central Research Institute. Second, research academics must promote the spirit of science and use scientific methods. How to enrich the Central Research Institute and the food and books of schools at all levels in the future must be worked together to propose concrete measures. Third, research academics must have a stable environment, so that those engaged in academics can research with peace of mind. How to promote national unity and social peace is not only the responsibility of politicians but also the responsibility of academics. Fourth, those who research academics must have a stable life. If they are allowed to engage in national cultural work with an empty stomach, it is absolutely impossible. Therefore, guaranteeing the life of scholars is also an urgent issue.</p>
<h3>Academic Research Requires a Stable Life; Results Can Certainly Be Achieved in Just Ten Years - Hu Shi's Response</h3>
<p>Hu Shi responded, stating: The government is very enthusiastic in promoting academic research. However, in fact, our experts and researchers are always suffocating under the burden of life. Some are sick in bed due to insufficient nutrition, and some are busy holding babies and emptying chamber pots for their wives, so there is no way to talk about academic research at all. Twenty or thirty years ago, the United States had no status in academics, but today this situation has changed significantly. The California Institute of Technology, established only twenty years ago, has produced many experts, many of whom have won the Nobel Prize. The Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton stipulates that only those who have obtained a doctoral degree are qualified to enter for research. It accommodates experts who were exiled from Nazi Germany, such as Albert Einstein, the inventor of the theory of relativity, who have made glorious contributions to world academics. I used to think that it was a great regret that China did not have a university or research institution with a history of fifty years. Now my views are different. History and age are not enough to determine everything. If the government can stabilize our lives and have sufficient funding for our research, I believe that we can certainly achieve considerable results in just ten years. There is no shortage of talent in China. The medicine of Mr. Lin Kesheng, the psychology of Mr. Wang Jingxi, and the archeology of the gentlemen engaged in excavation in Anyang are all highly admired by experts around the world. What we need is a stable life. Only in a stable life can we concentrate all our energy on academic research. (See page eight for the opening of the Central Research Institute Council meeting)</p>
<h3>Envoy Sze Leaves Hangzhou for Nanjing This Morning - Attended the Reader Reception at Our Newspaper Office Yesterday - Won a Body Nourishing Product in the Lottery and Repeatedly Thanked Us</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Dispatch from Hangzhou, 20th] Ambassador Sze, accompanied by General Secretary Kui Sheng of the YMCA, went to Hushantang in Zhong'an Bridge in the city this morning for Holy Communion. Chairman Shen and Secretary-General Lei both attended. Ambassador Sze was invited to give a speech, promoting the Confucian idea of "establishing others as you wish to establish yourself, and enabling others as you wish to enable yourself." At the same time, his student Qian Runhuan, who had just come to Hangzhou from Beiping, and Qian's fiancée, Xue Peiying, who had rushed from Hong Kong, held a simple and solemn religious wedding officiated by Ambassador Sze in the Hushantang, which was built to commemorate Ambassador Sze's father, Stuart. At noon, the church held a public banquet for Ambassador Sze. After the banquet, he preached at Hushantang on the necessity of the union of various church denominations, and he forcefully stated that the Chinese political situation must also unite all parties in order to have a future. After the lecture, accompanied by Wang Kui Sheng and Tang Yu Mei, he drove to No. 78 Hubin Road, the Hangzhou office of this newspaper, and participated in the reader reception of this newspaper in his capacity as a reader. Director Chu Yusheng warmly entertained him and showed him around the various facilities of the office. He also read today's newspaper and saw that the Hangzhou dispatch on the front page of the second edition described his itinerary in more detail than other Shanghai newspapers. He smiled at Director Chu and thanked him repeatedly when he saw "A Record of Ambassador Sze's Former Residence" by our reporter Huang Xing Tian on page nine. Then, his friend gave him a receipt for a donation to this newspaper and invited him to participate in the lottery ceremony of the Shanghai major manufacturers' joint gift event of this newspaper. Ambassador Sze drew No. 23 and won a bottle of "Vita-Torque." Ambassador Sze accepted it with a smile and said: "Thank you! Thank you for the wonderful body nourishing product!" At this time, the room was full of onlookers, and the road in front of the steps outside the door was blocked. Everyone believed that Ambassador Sze would be able to live another seventy years as Chairman Shen said if he got this great product. Then, he inspected the statistical charts on the wall and repeatedly praised the daily increase in sales of this newspaper in Hangzhou and the comprehensiveness of the communication network in Zhejiang Province. He turned around and said to the reporter: "Your newspaper is so enterprising and promising, and its future is limitless." After speaking, he visited the Youth Hall to see Lu Fei's calligraphy exhibition. The author presented him with two pictures, "Autumn Chrysanthemum" and "Cloud Bamboo." Then, he was hired by alumni of Yenching University to take a boat to visit the West Lake. The scenery of the lake and mountains was as beautiful as ever. He said that he also loved the Three Pools Mirroring the Moon, the Huxin Pavilion, the Autumn Moon on the Calm Lake, and the Chenghuang Mountain when he was a child. As the sun set in the west and the twilight was vast, he finished his tour and went to Louwailou for a banquet hosted by Yenching University alumni. After the meal, Ambassador Sze spent the last night of his trip in his second hometown. He will fly to Jianqiao tomorrow morning and return to Nanjing to continue to work for China's peace and unity.</p>
<h3>The US Donates Landing Craft</h3>

<h3>Sixty-One Overseas Chinese Illegally Entering the Philippines Deported</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Manila, 19th] The Philippine government recently ordered the deportation of sixty-one overseas Chinese, who were said to have illegally entered the Philippines via the northern coast of Luzon this week. This is the second batch of overseas Chinese arrested for "illegally entering the Philippines via northern Luzon." The first batch of forty-one people were arrested after landing between Aparri and Laoag.</p>
<h3>Various Countries Implement Assimilation Education; Schools are Prohibited from Offering Chinese Classes; Overseas Chinese Compatriots Urgently Hope the Government Will Lodge Protests</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 20th] It is reported that various countries are implementing assimilation education for our overseas Chinese compatriots. For example, the United States prohibits formal schools from offering Chinese classes. The Honolulu Board of Education has set restrictions on learning Chinese. In the Malaya-Singapore area, pre-war censorship of foreign books will be implemented. Teaching materials containing nationalistic ideas and social consciousness will be deleted. The shortage of overseas teachers is becoming increasingly serious, and it is difficult to hire teachers from China to go abroad due to immigration laws. As a result, most overseas students study English and do not know Chinese. Overseas Chinese elders miss their motherland and pay great attention to the education of the next generation. Although they run Chinese night schools to make up for it, the teaching materials are not suitable, and it is difficult to recognize square characters. On the contrary, they regard learning Chinese as a long journey. If this continues, in another thirty years, overseas Chinese in various places will be completely isolated from the culture of the motherland. Overseas Chinese newspapers will also be discontinued because no one can read them. This concerns the future of the country. Overseas Chinese compatriots deeply hope that the government will pay close attention and lodge serious protests with various countries to save the critical situation.</p>
<h3>Nanjing Municipal Senator Election - Wu Tiecheng, Chen Lifu, and Others All Voted in Person - The Final Results Will Be Officially Announced This Morning</h3>

From 7:00 a.m., men, women, old and young gathered in front of the 114 regional election polling stations. Professional groups also gathered separately to conduct the second round of voting. Campaign slogans on the nearby walls were dazzling. Campaign programs broadcasted by radio were also heard everywhere. The citizens who visited the bustling city during the holiday formed a spectacle. Minister Zhang Lisheng, Mayor Ma Chaojun, Director Han Wenhuan, and Deputy Directors of the Election Office Chen Jianru and Yang Ketian, as well as various supervisors, went to various polling places early in the morning to inspect and instructed all registrars, scribes, and police officers to work carefully and maintain order. The special reporter car prepared by the municipal government was also full of Chinese and foreign reporters, who started from the city and circled around to observe the ceremony. First, they visited Mayor Ma's official residence at No. 1 Yihe Road. After Mayor Ma's wife personally served coffee, they boarded the car together at 9:40 a.m. and went to the No. 54 polling station of Langya Road Primary School to participate in the election. The Mayor and his wife followed the orderly line of voters and followed the regional election and voting procedures. First, they handed in their citizen certificates. After the registrar checked them, they stamped them with a "Regional Election Vote Cast" stamp and signed the voter registration book. After receiving the ballot and writing on it, they put it into the ballot box. The mayor's choice was the current speaker of the Provisional Senate, Chen Yuguang. His wife's target was kept secret. The reporter's special car continued to visit various polling stations. The general order was good. Only a few ignorant people were found to be signaling elections near the polling stations or unreasonably withholding ballots, all of which were corrected according to law. The second round of professional group elections was the most successful for the labor union. Wang Yisheng, director of the General Labor Union, was elected as the first senator of Nanjing at 11:00 a.m. with 186 votes. The order of the Chamber of Commerce was still good. Zhang Jianzhai, a famous doctor, and Shen Jiuxiang, a reporter stationed in Nanjing before the war, were elected in the free professional election. However, in the Education Association, a few bad people discredited the most powerful candidate, Li Qingsong, controlled the venue, and obstructed the election. Voting did not begin until 1:00 p.m. The regional election ended at 7:00 p.m. The supervisors, together with the chiefs of the districts and villages and representatives of the voters, publicly counted the votes that evening.

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Hoping for a Brighter Political Situation from Now On</h3>
<p>The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) representative Zhou Enlai and others, along with representatives of the Third Side, boarded a special government plane in the early dawn and went to Nanjing to resume the long-stalled peace talks. This is a major turning point in the current domestic situation, making all the people across the country who long for peace and unity feel extremely gratified, and rekindling a glimmer of hope for the domestic situation.</p>
<p>Since the government re-issued the armistice in June of this year, the peace talks have failed to resolve the issues. Instead, the distance between the two sides has grown further. The flames of war have also spread, despite the mediation of mediator Marshall and Ambassador Stuart. However, both sides were deadlocked over the issue of "three" and "five." Until recently, the National Army recovered Zhangjiakou, and the government issued an order to convene the National Assembly. The CCP's attitude became increasingly unreasonable, almost causing the peace talks, which were in a state of suspension, to fall into a crisis of complete collapse. People across the country were frightened by the seriousness of the situation, and their desire for peace became even more urgent. In view of this, the government adopted many opinions from other parties, and Chairman Chiang issued a statement on the 16th regarding the handling of the current situation, reiterating the government's fundamental attitude of always adhering to a political solution to domestic political problems, and proposing eight concrete measures to solve the CCP problem, which were unanimously supported by the whole country. The Third Side also believed that the time was pressing and that the CCP could not afford to miss this last opportunity, so they rose up and appealed, repeatedly urging Zhou Enlai and others in Shanghai to go to Nanjing as soon as possible to resume talks, and put forward the slogan of "talk, stop, talk." After two or three days of running around and exchanging views, they finally reached a conclusion in a harmonious atmosphere, deciding that CCP representative Zhou Enlai and others and representatives of the Third Side would go to Nanjing today.</p>
<p>Our newspaper's editorial has repeatedly pointed out that the government values the people's desire for peace and recuperation, so it does not hesitate to compromise and seek peace. It has also made great efforts to urge Zhou to go to Nanjing as soon as possible to resume talks. What was the government's representative doing, traveling back and forth between Nanjing and Shanghai twice? Wasn't it to leave a glimmer of hope for the country and prevent the people from suffering from the pain of war again? Before we heard the news that Zhou Enlai had agreed to go to Nanjing, we had already predicted that the government's sincerity in seeking peace would surely move even the hardest hearts. Now, Zhou Enlai finally did not disappoint us and boarded a plane to Nanjing this morning. This is indeed a success of the Third Side's mediation, but it is also a victory for public opinion. We expect that today, no party can openly violate public opinion!</p>
<p>However, Zhou's going to Nanjing to resume peace talks can only be regarded as a turning point in the current situation, leading to the reopening of peace talks. But whether the situation can be brightened from now on depends on the efforts of the KMT and the Communist Party and the Third Side in the peace talks. Most importantly, we must take a broad view, take into account the overall situation, and not argue over minor details. Therefore, we deeply hope that the CCP can also accept the eight points proposed by Chairman Chiang as the basis for peace talks. Otherwise, after the resumption of peace talks, there will be no clue, no direction, and the peace talks will still be long and full of dreams, and there is a danger of repeating the mistakes of the past, making our people happy in vain again.</p>
<p>In short, we have great expectations for Zhou Enlai and others' trip to Nanjing today to resume peace talks. We hope that the political situation will be brightened from now on, so that the aspirations of our people can be realized. In the future, not only will our people no longer suffer from the disasters of war, but we will also be able to see representatives of the people across the country and representatives of various parties gather together in the coming month on the anniversary of the birth of the Father of the Nation to single-mindedly formulate a fundamental law for the country, so that China's politics can get on the track of constitutionalism as soon as possible.</p>
<h3>Byrnes' Speech</h3>
<p>The Paris Peace Conference has just ended, and the United Nations General Assembly will be held in New York on the 23rd of this month. Although the Paris Peace Conference passed the draft peace treaties with the five countries of Italy, Romania, Finland, Hungary, and Bulgaria, there were many disturbances during the conference, and disputes arose in the meeting place, and the progress was not smooth. For example, the issues of the Port of Trieste and the free navigation of the Danube River have not been resolved due to the insistence of Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union. And the most unsettling phenomenon in the world is, as U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes said, not the "provisions of the draft peace treaties" of the five countries, but the increasing tension between the United States and the Soviet Union. Therefore, whether the Second United Nations General Assembly can be successful depends on whether the ruling authorities of the United States and the Soviet Union hold a friendly attitude. Byrnes's speech broadcast to the United States on the evening of the 18th has therefore attracted the attention of the world. Now that the speech has been published, Byrnes's attitude towards the Soviet Union is not as tough as before, and even Wallace, who opposes him, said that he "has made progress compared to his speech in Stuttgart, Germany." This is enough to prove that the United States is determined to have peace with the Soviet Union, which is worthy of the joy of peace-loving people around the world.</p>
<p>In his speech, Byrnes first tried his best to dispel the fear that a new war is inevitable, believing that this fallacy is the cause of tension between countries and within countries. This is indeed a penetrating remark. Since the end of World War II, the argument that a third world war is inevitable has been rife, especially after Stalin announced on February 9 this year that another war is inevitable, which filled the Soviet Union with fear, strengthened its military internally, and openly and secretly competed and expanded its so-called security zone externally. At the same time, the United States has also gradually developed a sense of fear. President Truman announced that the United States is now facing the same crisis as before the Pearl Harbor incident. The United States' attitude towards the Soviet Union has also become increasingly tough, and defense work has also been actively carried out.</p>
<p>The fear of war is certainly the crux of all problems. However, to eliminate this mentality, mutual concessions from both sides are necessary. If one side makes concessions and the other side oppresses, an understanding can certainly be reached, but it is not easy to do so unless there is absolute military superiority. Byrnes believes that the United States does not want to do this, and the United States does not want other countries to do it. Every understanding is to reconcile differences, not to have one country succumb to the autocratic will of another country. This is indeed an open and honest statement. Wallace's speech last time advocating appeasement towards the Soviet Union aroused dissatisfaction among public opinion in the United States and eventually led to his resignation. Byrnes's speech this time, while firm in its attitude towards the Soviet Union, showed considerable concessions and tolerance, as if he himself had extended a hand first, and the Soviet Union could dispel its fears and openly discuss with the United States, make mutual concessions, and avoid all conflicts.</p>
<p>Peace must be based on mutual trust, and understanding is based on mutual concessions. This is an irrefutable truth. Now, people around the world who are concerned about international politics, unless they have preconceived notions, have no reason to place all the responsibility for the tension between the United States and the Soviet Union on the shoulders of the ruling authorities of any one country. We can only fairly say that in the past, both the United States and the Soviet Union seemed to be a little lacking in this point of mutual trust. Stalin believed that war was inevitable, and Truman also made similar announcements. The Soviet Union disregarded the people's lives and fully expanded its military, and the United States seemed to have to make some preparations. The Soviet Union's expansion of its influence abroad naturally encountered resistance from the United States. In the United Nations organization, the Foreign Ministers' Conference, and the Paris Peace Conference, the representatives of the United States and the Soviet Union and the representatives of countries closer to the two sides insisted on their positions on any issue, and it was very difficult to obtain a satisfactory solution, and the reason for this lies here. Victory has passed for a year, the world cannot be safe, and the United States and the Soviet Union must bear a great responsibility for showing mutual trust and mutual concessions.</p>
<p>In Byrnes's speech, he specifically pointed out four prerequisites for resolving world problems by peaceful means, the first of which is the necessity of establishing mutual trust and a spirit of coordination among nations, and at the same time, it is necessary to try to eliminate malicious propaganda. His own speech is based on a spirit of coordination and attempts to establish mutual trust. Therefore, the entire text is straightforward and frank, and it is a valuable diplomatic document. As for the other three points, if all countries must seek cooperation under the United Nations organization and with respect for the authority of the United Nations, no country can claim to have a "monopoly on virtue and wisdom," and no country can coerce, threaten, or use force to fill the established rights of other nations, this should be the criterion for general international relations in the current international situation. Byrnes also said: "We must cooperate with each other—with or without a veto—to defend the principles and purposes of the United Nations Charter..." We hope that this spirit of coordination can be responsive, then international cooperation will not be difficult to achieve, and the guarantee of lasting world peace can be hoped for.</p>

<h3>Active Relief Efforts in Northern Jiangsu Province Focus on Food, Finance, and Security Refugees Return to Their Hometowns to Rebuild Their Devastated Homes</h3>
<p>[Report from Suzhou by our newspaper] After the recovery of various counties in northern Jiangsu, General Li Mo'an, commander of the First Pacification Zone, specially dispatched Major General Cheng Muyi, a senior staff officer of his department, to northern Jiangsu to be responsible for the work of calming and supervising. Recently, Mr. Cheng arrived in Suzhou on the 18th at about 4 p.m. from his post on official business. After hearing the news, the special reporter of our newspaper stationed in Suzhou went to visit him by bicycle late at night to inquire about the general situation in northern Jiangsu. Mr. Cheng gave a detailed account, which is briefly recorded as follows. Since the 4th of this month, the National Army in northern Jiangsu launched the defense battle of the Lianhe Line, giving a head-on blow to the invading Communist Army. On the morning of the 6th, it moved into Shaobo, and on the 8th, it recovered Gaoyou. At the same time, the National Army that went south from the north also advanced rapidly and met in Fanshui as scheduled, cutting off the Grand Canal Line that had been cut off for nearly ten months, and was able to recover it in the shortest week. The magistrates of Gaoyou, Baoying, Huai'an, and other counties who are currently refugees in Jiangdu have returned to their original posts, and the refugees in each county have also returned to their hometowns one after another to rebuild their devastated homes. The most serious problems in northern Jiangsu at present are roughly three: (1) Food panic. When the Communist Army occupied and then withdrew, all the rice, paddy, and wheat were taken away, which made the food panic of the returning refugees even more serious. The government is now trying to provide relief in many ways. (2) Financial exhaustion. When the Communist Army controlled northern Jiangsu, it issued an uncountable amount of resistance currency. Although it has now stopped circulating, the heavy losses suffered by the people are irreparable. Recently, the Central Farmers Bank is starting to set up branches and offices in major cities and towns to prepare to provide agricultural loans to regulate financial exhaustion. (3) Security concerns: Although the Communist Army has retreated to the north one after another after being counterattacked by the National Army, there are still a small number of them who have disintegrated and are roaming near the cities and towns, which has a great impact on security. The authorities are now besieging and suppressing them in order to clear each county seat that has been restored. Self-defense teams are established, and the government allocates guns to help consolidate local security.</p>
<p>[Report from Haizhou by our newspaper] The Suling Branch of the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration believed that there were many refugees in the Haizhou area and that it was necessary to continue to allocate materials for relief. Now, the Suling Branch has approved the allocation of the fourth batch of relief materials of 1,000 tons, which were loaded on the Yongxing ship in Shanghai and arrived in Lianyungang on the 15th. Tens of thousands of refugees were overjoyed.</p>
<p>[Report from Nantong by our newspaper] The Linshan Conference and the county party headquarters believed that the weather was suddenly cold and that most of the refugees did not have cotton clothes to keep warm, so they jointly telegraphed the Zhenbei Suling Branch to quickly transport the promised 1,000 sets of cotton clothes to Tong, so that they could be distributed to the refugees as soon as possible to keep them warm and avoid the refugees from being frozen and sick. Also, because the Nantong branch of the Enemy and Puppet Industry Disposal Bureau has a large number of old military uniforms and shoes, which have been stored for a long time and may become waste, they jointly telegraphed the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui District Enemy and Puppet Industry Disposal Bureau to ask the county to order the Nantong branch to transfer them to the refugees in northern Jiangsu free of charge, so as to avoid most of the refugees from being unable to withstand the cold.</p>
<h3>A Glimpse of the Rural Areas of Southern Jiangsu Unsound Self-Government Allows Bandits to Thrive The Remote Areas Have a Utopia, Lamentable Gap Between Officials and People The Superintendent Returns for a Chat</h3>
<p>[Report from Suzhou by our newspaper on the 20th] Dai Jianhua, the magistrate of Su County and superintendent, set off on the 16th with Jin Qigong, the secretary-general of the party headquarters and deputy superintendent, and led the responsible officials of security, civil affairs, and military affairs and a part of the military force to the county-affiliated second, third, and fourth districts in the Taihu Lake area to supervise and guide the implementation of the suppression work and reorganize the Baojia system. It took five days, traveling through more than ten towns and villages such as Mudu, Guangfu, Xihua Island, Tong'an Bridge, Xiangshan, and Dongzhu, and returned to the city on the 20th via Huzhen Pass. The special reporter of our newspaper stationed in Suzhou visited Mr. Dai and Mr. Jin at their private residences at about 7 p.m. to inquire about their general impressions of the rural areas on this trip. Both gave very detailed accounts, which are summarized as follows: (1) Because the autumn harvest this year was extremely good, most tenant farmers had surplus grain, and agricultural implements were quite complete. Although there were signs of shortage, it could not be called exhaustion. (2) The security of the rural areas, except for towns such as Guangfu, Mudu, and Huzhen Pass, Xihua Island, Tong'an Bridge, Xiangshan, Dongzhu, and other places were said to be the mobile areas of Xue Yonghui's bandit group. However, after searching, no bandits were found. According to local elders, there were very few disturbances. Now, a squadron of the Security Brigade led by Wei Sun Shen has been sent to cooperate with the Lian Qingjiao District. The soldiers went deeper into the remote villages in the Xiangshan, Yangshan, and Baima areas to search, and winter defense joint offices were set up in Tong'an Bridge and Xihua Island to concentrate the self-defense team guns from the five neighboring villages, unify the distribution and coordination, disband the original self-defense team members, assess them separately, train them, and prepare to complete the training of 1,200 strong men in a short period of time. Each office is equipped with 600 people, becoming a regular local armed force, and each squadron of the Security Brigade is stationed. (3) Rural education is still relatively common, but Xihua Island is an island area extending into Taihu Lake, divided into five villages, and there is only one primary school, which urgently needs to be added. (4) Rural transportation, except for Xihua Island, all towns are along highways or railways. It has now been decided to build a 10-mile-long section of the Sufu Highway from Guangfu to Xihua Island. (5) Rural autonomy is generally not sound enough, and township chiefs are not responsible, which is a common phenomenon. An adjustment plan has now been drafted. Mr. Dai also used Xihua Island as an example and said to the reporter with emotion: The island has fertile land, almost a utopia, but the government has never paid attention to it, and even self-government and administration have not been promoted, so that the general people almost do not know how to distinguish between soldiers and bandits. To put it bluntly, there is almost no impression of what is called the government in the minds of the people on the island. The gap between officials and people has reached this extreme, so that Xue Yonghui's bandit group often appears and disappears, without any scruples, and it is rumored that Xihua has almost become a gathering place of terror. After my inspection, I saw that the folk customs were simple and honest, and the products were extremely rich. If the economy, transportation, and education can be developed with each other, it may become a good model village. It is known that after the 24th of this month, Mr. Dai will visit the East and West Dongting Mountains and Hengjing and other places, and invite reporters to go together to see the real situation of the rural areas.</p>
<h3>Mudu District Chief Accepts Bribes to Protect Gambling</h3>
<p>[Report from Suzhou by our newspaper] At this time of the new harvest season, the four villages in this county are all having bumper harvests, and the price of rice is high this year. The villagers are all happily counting their money earned from selling rice. After a year of hard work, it is inevitable that they will want to use prostitution and gambling to adjust their spirits. The Provisional Council of this county has long been aware of this and has discussed methods to prohibit gambling in the townships and districts. After sending a letter to the county government to handle the matter, the county government has ordered each district to strictly prohibit it and ordered each district chief to take full responsibility to emphasize their responsibilities. However, Qin Xigui, the district chief of Mudu District, a subordinate of the county, ignored the law and let the local hooligan Zhou Changyan take advantage of the opportunity to open a gambling den in the Fushou Temple on West Street in the town, sitting back and reaping the profits. The ignorant villagers lost all their hard-earned money in an instant. After opening for a month, there were not a few cases of people being ruined and impoverished. The Wuxian County Government found out about this and strictly ordered the Mudu Patrol Office to work with the district office self-defense team to arrest them. Except for those who escaped over the wall after hearing the news, the gambling boss Zhou Changyan and seven gamblers were arrested and escorted to the city on the 18th. The military law office of the county government questioned them in detail. The gambling boss Zhou Changyan immediately confessed that the Mudu District Office, from the district chief to the clerks and district guards, all received offerings on a daily basis, ranging from 10,000 yuan to several thousand yuan per day depending on the size of the position, and firmly stated that the confessions were all facts and could provide solid evidence. It is heard that the county magistrate of this county believed that the current district chief dared to disregard the law, accept bribes, and protect gambling, and decided to severely punish him according to the law to serve as a warning to others.</p>

<h3>Gu Zhutong Sends Two Key Personnel to Wuhu to Assist in Investigation and Negotiate Prices for Compensation of Sold Materials</h3>
<p>[Report from Wuhu from This Newspaper, 20th] (1) Gu Zhutong has dispatched Lieutenant General Senior Advisor Lu Xu and Finance Director Bing Xun to Wuhu yesterday to assist Ma Jingchang from Wuxi in investigating the materials of the Fifth Receiving Group of the Former Third War Area, and to negotiate prices for compensating over a thousand tons of rapeseed, soybeans, and wheat sold in Shanghai. (2) The Chaoxian Coal Mine, located 200 miles from Wuhu, was taken over by local powerful figures who used security teams to protect it after the enemy and puppets handed it over. They employed new machinery from the Ma'anshan Mine in Dangtu to extract coal, which was transported and sold to Nanjing and Wuhu, generating profits exceeding one billion yuan. Upon arriving in Wuhu, Ma immediately telegraphed Chairman Li Pinxian requesting an investigation and reply, and dispatched personnel to assist in the investigation. Ten days have passed since the telegram was sent, but no reply has been received. Ma is still patiently waiting for a response from the Anhui Provincial Government, but he is determined not to let this case go. (3) He Zongzhang, the former police chief of Wuhu, was summoned for discrepancies in the handover of materials after leaving his post. He refused to meet. Ma telegraphed the Anhui Provincial Government to summon him, but received no response. He is from Henan and owns property at the Taikoo Wharf in Wuhu. Ma believes that if He does not come for questioning, he will bear the consequences himself. (4) Ma Zhonghe from Yumin Rice Mill sent someone to claim that the factory's machinery was purchased from a Mr. Chen, who has already sent a telegram from Suzhou to prove it. The factory's machinery has been sealed. (5) On the 18th, Ma discovered that the Yuanchang Flour Mill was the property of the traitor Li Huilong, the former chairman of the puppet chamber of commerce. When Li fled, he colluded with a Mr. Pan, the adjutant Li Zhiqian of a certain division, and Commander Mo, changing the mill's name and selling it to a Mr. Ke from Anqing for 21 million yuan before the investigation team arrived in Wuhu. This case has been investigated, and the factory will be sealed. (6) Gu Zhi Long, the representative of the China Mining Bureau of the National Resources Commission in charge of receiving the Digang Mine, is suspected of obstructing mine owners from reclaiming small coal mines for self-management and coercing subordinates to provide false evidence. Ma has investigated the matter and handed it over to the court. Ma is in Wuhu and still needs to deal with the Chaoxian Coal Mine and He Zongzhang cases, which will cause delays.</p>

<h3>Haimen Dredges Inland Rivers</h3>
<p>[Report from Taizhou from This Newspaper] Haimen in Taizhou is the import and export hub for the six old Taizhou counties. Commerce is prosperous, and the population is dense. During the Anti-Japanese War, the area was invaded by the enemy three times, causing significant damage and losses. Since the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, the authorities and local people have launched efforts to revive the city. Over the past year, commerce has gradually flourished, and the population has also gradually increased. Various constructions, such as repairing roads, building houses, and constructing docks, have been completed one after another. There are ships sailing to and from Taizhou and Shanghai, Taizhou and Ningbo, and Taizhou and Wenzhou in the outer port. Small steamers shuttle between Haimen and Huangyan, and Haimen and Linhai in the inner port. Although there are scheduled boats sailing on the inland rivers to Luqiao, Wenling, Songmen, Daxi, Xinhe, Panshi, Jinqing Port, Zeguo, and other ports, the river ports have been in disrepair for years, and the accumulation of dirt has hindered navigation. Currently, the district office and local people are initiating the dredging of the rivers to facilitate transportation.</p>
<h3>Five Counties in Southern Anhui Cooperate to Eliminate Flooding: Repairing Embankments and Dredging Rivers on the Qingyi River, Conducting On-site Surveys and Using Work Relief</h3>
<p>[Report from Wuhu from This Newspaper] Representatives from Wuhu, Xuancheng, Nanling, Jingxian, and Dangtu counties, as well as the Anhui Water Conservancy Bureau and the Tenth Engineering Office of the Farmland Water Conservancy Project, held a conference on agriculture, forestry, and irrigation on the 16th.

On the night of the 10th of this month, several dholes suddenly appeared at the home of the Hu family in Canghou Street in the county town, howling and searching for food in front of the door. Also, outside the South Gate at Tenglingjiao, a farmer woman surnamed Lin was working in front of her door at around 4:00 PM on the 11th of this month, with her five-year-old son on her back. Suddenly, a dhole snatched her son and devoured him. The woman immediately cried for help, but the dhole had already disappeared far away. Furthermore, a farmer's child near Daxi was also bitten and injured by a dhole while herding cattle in the mountains. Although he was rescued, his life is in danger. Cases of dholes biting and killing people in the surrounding villages are frequently heard.</p>
<h3>Haining's Autumn Silkworm Crop Fails, Requesting Exemption from Seed Loan Payments</h3>
<p>Agricultural Bank Limits Repayment of Silkworm Loans by End of Month</p>
<p>[Report from Haining from This Newspaper] This county's silk industry has been quite developed. During the war, it was ravaged by the enemy and puppets and was on the verge of bankruptcy. In order to develop the rural economy and enrich the people's livelihood, the county government assisted the silkworm industry promotion office in providing silkworm seed loans. Unexpectedly, the weather this autumn has been exceptionally hot, resulting in a disastrous harvest, only one or two tenths of the usual yield. Furthermore, this year's rice harvest has also failed, leaving the rural economy at a standstill. Farmers are unable to cope with the required seed loan payments, and villagers have flocked to the county government to request exemptions. The county government, recognizing the situation, telegraphed the provincial promotion office yesterday, requesting approval for the exemptions.</p>
<p>[Another Report] The China Farmers Bank will set up a branch office in Xia, and Xia Dingfang has been appointed as the director, which will open soon. The Agricultural Bank had previously provided autumn silkworm capital loans, releasing a total of 50 units, amounting to 31.17 million yuan, from August 25 to September 10. The Agricultural Bank has now ordered the loans to be fully repaid by the end of October. In recent days, the bank has sent personnel to Chang'an, Xuxiang, Wengbu, Xiejiao, Qingyunqiao, and other places to notify each unit to repay on schedule.</p>

<h3>Chinese Medicine Practitioners Should Regulate Consultation Fees</h3>
<p>Reading the article "Autumn Brings More Illnesses, Patients Cannot Afford Doctors' Fees" on the 14th, I am deeply moved. I have long intended to ask the government to explicitly regulate the consultation fees of Shanghai doctors, which vary widely. Some say it may cause controversy, so I have hesitated to do so, but I always feel like a bone stuck in my throat, and I have to spit it out. Therefore, I contribute my humble opinion, stating it as follows:</p>
<p>It is said that there are three major elements of a doctor: learning, knowledge, and courage. Reading ten thousand books, unprecedented, is called learning; vast experience, accurate diagnosis, is called knowledge; prescribing medicine according to the illness, appropriate attack and supplementation, is called courage. Possessing all three, ancient people believed that the art of medicine was complete. But today, it is no longer easy to say this. Now, I set aside this and mention what I call the root. What is the root? It is morality. If we speak of learning without morality, it is inevitable to embellish cunning; if we speak of knowledge without morality, it is inevitable to indulge in bias; if we speak of courage without morality, it is inevitable to increase recklessness. Moreover, doctors have different personalities, and their classes are uneven. Secretly passing down teachings, each adheres to their own correctness. Without medical ethics to guide them back to the right path, wouldn't the great undertaking of wise hearts and benevolent arts be comparable to witchcraft and fortune-telling, making the sacred art of medicine like lightning across the sky, sometimes hidden, sometimes bright, and like a stream of water in an ancient valley, sometimes cut off, sometimes continued, isn't that regrettable? But morality is nothing more than pure conduct and noble intelligence, both of which are sufficient to fulfill it.</p>
<p>However, morality and fame are not mutually compatible, and only those who can abandon profit can be spoken to. It is reasonable for doctors to seek reward and for patients to reward doctors. But today's doctors are contrary to medical ethics. Regarding their own consultation fees, they are accustomed to varying widely. They like to display high prices, making themselves look important, and ignorant patients believe that their skills must be exquisite because of their high consultation fees, competing to invite them (this is also the case with Western medicine). Thus, the doctors' plans succeed, and the world is like this. Hypocrisy becomes more skilled, and without learning to deceive, it is difficult to make a living. The medical atmosphere in Shanghai has reached this point, it is simply unbearable to ask! Mencius said: The heart of compassion, everyone has it. Those who practice medicine, since they hold the power of life, should have a heart to help the world. But to take advantage of people in times of crisis, to kick a man when he is down, looking back and reflecting on oneself, is it right or wrong to betray morality and take profit? It doesn't matter to the wealthy, but how can the poor and sick bear it? It is requested that the Beijing municipal government's regulations from 26 years ago be used as a precedent to regulate the consultation, house call, and registration fees of Chinese medicine practitioners in a unified manner, and that it be implemented in this city so that we can speak of "benefiting the poor and sick."

<h3>Improving Transportation in Pudong</h3>
<p>To improve the appearance of the city and prosper urban commerce, it is necessary to first move the smog-filled factories to the suburbs of the city. However, establishing a transportation network in the suburbs of the city is also a matter of urgency! The authorities have also considered the importance of this issue and have planned the "Pujiang Iron Bridge." However, it seems necessary to improve the existing transportation as well.</p>
<p>(1) Revise the Standard Time of the Municipal Ferry: In this "house shortage" city, the average salaried civil servants, etc., do not have "gold bars" to buy western-style houses, so they have to find housing in the suburbs of the city—Pudong. In the past summer time, the first municipal ferry arrived at the Shanghai pier at only 8:00, and the last ferry back left at 6:00; this did not conflict with the time of government agencies or offices, and they could still return in time. Starting on the first of this month, it was changed to standard time, the morning ferry arrived in Shanghai at 9:20, and the last ferry back to Pudong left at 5:45; this has made it difficult for general office workers who leave early and return late.</p>
<p>(2) Operate Public Buses after Repairing the Highway: In the Premier's plan for national construction, there is a plan to "build 100,000 miles of highway and 100,000 miles of railway." I remember that in the 20th year of the Republic of China, our government authorities built a coal seam highway along the Pudong coast. Before the war, there were public buses operating between the Lan Nidu and Yangjingzhen. However, after more than eight years of destruction by the enemy and puppets and disrepair, the road surface has become "full of holes." After this victory, public buses were restored without repairing the highway, and the route was quite long, so this great highway has become one hole in the east and one hole in the west, rugged and uneven. When it rains, mud splashes everywhere.</p>
<p>Finally, I saw in the newspaper that the Public Works Bureau has taken measures to ban rickshaws and eliminate tricycles. However, the drivers have started a petition to the capital because of the threat to their livelihoods. In my humble opinion, it may be possible to allow these vehicles that have been suspended to operate in the suburbs. First, it can maintain the livelihoods of these drivers, and second, because the vehicles are lighter, it can maintain the integrity of the current highways. What do the authorities think?

<h3>Parks Should Have Fitness Equipment</h3>
<p>The only place in this city for citizens to exercise is the City Stadium (speaking of those near the city center). The fitness equipment there only includes one set of parallel bars and one set of horizontal bars, and there is no sand pit underneath, but a hard square brick ground. I personally saw a citizen who accidentally fell while practicing on the horizontal bar. As a result, his head was broken and bleeding, and the square brick ground was stained with blood. If there was a sand pit underneath, then although he might be injured, it would not be so severe. The park is the place with the cleanest air in the city, and many citizens exercise there every morning. Why not use the park as a place to set up one or two parallel bars and horizontal bars as a place for citizens to exercise? It does not take up much space, so why not do it? This only takes a single effort from the relevant authorities, but it is beneficial to the national fitness.</p>

<h3>Safeguarding the Empire's Lifeline in the Middle East: Outline of British Defense Plans, Establishing Bases on the East and West Coasts of Africa, 3,000-Mile Super Highway Traversing the Black Continent</h3>
<p>[United Press, London, 19th] The reorganization of Britain's eastern lifeline may result in the establishment of bases on the east and west coasts of Africa, connected by a 3,000-mile super highway through the "Black Continent." The outline of this imperial defense plan has been revealed by government, colonial, and army departments, as many Middle East experts and military and political leaders are gathering in London for continuous meetings. Behind this plan is the implication that Britain has decided to withdraw from Egypt. The important political disputes in the Middle East and the important lessons of World War II are that the Mediterranean is not impregnable. The new Colonial Secretary Jones gave reporters a clear indication of this large-scale reorganization for the first time today. It is said that a plan is currently being discussed to build a large-scale base in Nigeria on the west coast of Africa, similar to the previously rumored government plan to establish a base on the east coast of the Kenyan colony. Although Jones's remarks were limited to colonial activities and did not provide details, military sources revealed that if bases were established on both coasts, defense advisors would recommend building artificial highways to connect them through the equatorial African deserts, forests, and swamps. One of the new Defense Secretary Alexander's top priorities is to study these interconnected proposals and present the Cabinet with the entire imperial military strategy plan. British military and political leaders have been discussing the consequences of the withdrawal of British troops from Egypt and the independence of India for several months. According to military sources, the report submitted by various experts to Prime Minister Attlee has determined four points regarding Britain's military role in the Middle East: (1) Defending the intercontinental lifeline—which now extends from Gibraltar through Suez to the Indian Ocean. (2) Defending the Middle East airfields, which are necessary for modern transportation. (3) Defending oil rights in Iran and Iraq. (4) Maintaining long-term alliances with the Arab world and promoting relations with Turkey.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 19th Special Telegram] Major General Martin, the military reporter for Scotland's first daily newspaper, "The Scotsman," said that in view of the unstable situation in East Asia, Britain should establish a Pacific naval base in Australia rather than in Hong Kong and Singapore. Martin's opinion was expressed when elaborating on the statement made by Australian Prime Minister Chifley. Chifley said: The British and Australian sides are currently discussing the establishment of a permanent British Pacific naval base in Australia. Martin said: In this atomic age, especially in view of the turbulent situation in East Asia, Britain must have a major base in Australian territorial waters.</p>

<h3>The United States and the Soviet Union Should Understand Each Other, War is Not Inevitable: Vandenberg Broadcast Reviews the Path to Peace</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 19th] Republican Senator Vandenberg, the U.S. representative to the Paris Peace Conference, tonight participated in a current affairs question-and-answer broadcast on the Columbia radio station with radio reporters. Vandenberg said, "The Soviet Union does not want war, and the United States does not want war. I hope we can stop talking about war." He added, "The foreign policy of the United States is a policy of peace, and it will succeed if it is not undermined domestically." When asked if this foreign policy was a tough policy towards the Soviet Union, he replied, "No, it is best described as a friendly and firm policy." Vandenberg also said, "We must be frank with the Soviet Union, our words, intentions, and actions must be consistent, and we must not say one thing and mean another, or act against our intentions. I also agree with Stalin's statement that 'Eastern communism and Western democracy can establish the principle of survival and make it survive.' But I must reiterate what I said before, that this cannot be achieved through unilateral efforts. I must make the United States do its best to eliminate the reasons for the Soviet Union's reasonable fears. We are doing this today, but the Soviet Union must also do the same. Today, the Soviet Union is still far from this. I have never heard any U.S. representative at the Paris Peace Conference accuse the Soviet Union's motives, but Soviet spokesmen and their partners have repeatedly made baseless accusations of the United States' motives. We may not yet understand Moscow, but Moscow clearly misunderstands us. The Russians should know that we have no conspiracy to conquer them. God can prove that we have no such thought in our souls. But we must also know that they have no intention of promoting a communist world." Vandenberg repeatedly said that the Soviet Union is a great country with great people, and we have a historical friendship with them, and this friendship must be maintained.</p>
<h3>Connally Talks About the Achievements of the Peace Conference</h3>
<p>Another United Press dispatch on the 19th: Senator Connally, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, returned from the Paris Peace Conference and told reporters on the Queen Elizabeth that he trusted the United Nations Security Council to enforce the resolution that Yugoslavia declared it was not bound by the peace treaty. We must not have another Fiume incident in this dispute. Yugoslavia declared that it would not abide by the treaty, but other countries can take action on their own in accordance with the terms of the treaty. If the Security Council does not have its own army at that time, it can ask the British and American countries to allocate troops and place them under its command. The Security Council has the right to act in accordance with the treaty. Connally advocated the restoration of German industry, saying that Europe needs Germany, and the United States does not want to destroy Germany. Connally also agreed with Byrnes's recent speech on the Paris Peace Conference, saying that the Paris Conference had achieved great success.</p>
<h3>Truman Expresses Sympathy for Byrnes's Speech</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper Report] San Francisco, 20th Radio: The State Department said that after Secretary of State Byrnes gave a broadcast speech to the nation reporting on the progress of the Paris Peace Conference, President Truman immediately congratulated him by phone.</p>
<h3>White House Denies Stalin Visiting the United States</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 19th] A Canadian newspaper reported that Stalin will visit the United States and Canada in November. This statement was denied by a White House spokesman, who said that he had neither heard of this statement nor had it been heard of in the White House Secretariat.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Halifax, 19th] The Halifax Chronicle reported that a high-level source said that when the British ship "Hokitanika" sails to the United States at the end of the month, Marshal Stalin will take the ship to the United States and may also visit Canada. A cabin has been prepared for Marshal Stalin on the ship. This news has not yet been confirmed. It is reported that the ship has been leased by British transportation to carry representatives of the Foreign Ministers' Conference to New York, scheduled to set sail from England on October 27.</p>

There is no actual money transfer for this loan. Instead, the bank guarantees the Turkish government, and American manufacturers accept a total of $25 million in Turkish government orders.</p>
<h3>United Nations General Assembly to Open the Day After Tomorrow; US President Will Personally Deliver a Speech; Heavy Disputes in the Provisional Agenda of the Assembly</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 19th] The White House announced: President Truman is scheduled to fly to New York on the 23rd of this month to address the United Nations General Assembly at 9:30 PM (Standard Time, 5:30 AM Shanghai Time on Thursday). The President will also attend a banquet at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel to entertain representatives of various countries and officials of UN agencies and will return to Washington by train at night. President Truman met with Secretary of State Byrnes, Under Secretary of State Acheson, and Representative to the UN Agencies Austin at the White House today to discuss plans for the General Assembly.</p>
<p>[United Press, New York, 19th] The United Nations General Assembly is now scheduled to open here on the 23rd, and its provisional agenda is full of contentious issues. Since the San Francisco UN Charter Conference, this General Assembly will be the largest and most historic international conference within the United States, not only because it is the first time the UN legislative body has convened in the US, but also because many extremely important issues need to be addressed at this session. The first half of the United Nations General Assembly was held in London in January and February of this year, and its main task was to establish several complex institutions. This session will take action on various important issues, such as the Franco regime issue, the relief of millions of European refugees, the issue of the use of the veto power in the Security Council, the reconstruction plan for areas that have suffered from war, the selection of a permanent site for the UN agencies, and the establishment of the UN Trusteeship Council. The future of Palestine may also be brought up for discussion. In addition, there is a very contentious issue on the provisional agenda: the Soviet Union has requested a report on the presence of foreign troops in non-enemy territories. This issue will involve the US troops stationed in China, Iceland, and Panama, and the British troops stationed in Iraq, Greece, Outer Jordan, and British India.</p>
<h3>US Representative to the Security Council Calls on Members to Cease Strife</h3>
<p>[United Press, New York, 19th] The United States Representative to the United Nations Security Council, Johnson, delivered a speech to the representatives attending the United Nations General Assembly on the 19th at the Foreign Policy Association, arguing that major powers should cooperate with each other in the Security Council, stop attacking each other and making unrealistic accusations and counter-accusations, and criticized the "abuse of the Security Council" and the "excessive use of the veto power" by various countries. It is said that the people of the world have deep concerns about the way the Security Council is used, and we all feel the need to replace mutual blame with a spirit of cooperation. If we are willing, we should strive harder for peace, not just for the victory of debate, and thus change the atmosphere of international relations.</p>
<h3>Dutch Government to Propose Re-surveying the Dutch-German Border</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, The Hague, 19th] Regarding the issue of re-surveying the border between the Netherlands and Germany, the Dutch government will convene the House of Representatives in the shortest possible time to present a plan to it. If the plan is approved by the parliament, it will be submitted to the Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference for discussion. According to this plan, any protruding areas on the border between the two countries should be incorporated into Dutch territory to straighten the border line. As for the small number of Germans within the land incorporated into Dutch territory, it is difficult to transport them to the British occupation zone, so it has been decided to let them remain in their original places. In addition, the Dutch government is also considering incorporating the island of Borkum, outside the German port of Emden, into its territory.</p>

<h3>The Work of the Allied Control Committee for Japan is Nominal; British Indifference, US and Soviet Union Sleep in Different Beds</h3>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 19th] Japan and Hungary are both defeated countries and both have Allied Control Committees that perform nominal occupation work. The Soviet Union naturally regards itself as the true master of Hungary, and MacArthur also naturally regards himself as the true master of Japan. The UN Headquarters in Japan does not welcome the concept of the Control Committee, and even expressed this before the Control Conference. Six months after the establishment of the Control Committee, MacArthur's representative, Acheson, the chairman of the Control Committee, hinted that MacArthur believed that the Committee was ineffective; in fact, the main function of the Control Committee is equivalent to a strong sounding board. The United States and the Soviet Union use it to accuse each other and expand propaganda. The Soviet representative, Teleftianko, apparently believes that the Control Committee is slightly useful. Mr. Teleftianko can reflect the Soviet government's emotions towards MacArthur at the meeting, and MacArthur's handling of the occupation zone is criticized by the Soviet press. The British representative, Baer, believes that even if the Control Committee has any value, it is minimal; the Chinese representative, Zhu Shiming, follows Acheson's lead. If at least two or even three of the four representatives of the Control Committee have doubts about the value of the meeting itself, what will the Committee achieve? To date, the Committee has passed the Land Reform Law, the Labor Law, and heard various suggestions regarding the nationalization of Japanese coal mines. The Moscow Foreign Ministers Conference organized the Control Committee for Japan to provide consultation to MacArthur, and MacArthur clearly decided that the Committee should not overstep into the scope of the administrative authority of the occupation of Japan. Acheson has often rejected some suggestions from the Soviet Union on the grounds of administrative matters. The representatives angrily stated at the meeting that the Headquarters neither acknowledged nor responded to their suggestions. Acheson's invariable reply was that the Headquarters welcomed criticism; in other words, MacArthur considered their opinions and made his own decisions.</p>
<h3>MacArthur Headquarters Claims No Policy Changes</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Tokyo, 19th] A spokesman for MacArthur Headquarters said: There has been no change in the policy towards Japan. The statement made by Acheson, the US representative to the Allied Control Committee, on October 16th that Japan's goals are now almost the same as those of the Allies, has been misunderstood as a change in the basic policy towards Japan. In fact, Mr. Acheson's statement was merely an acknowledgement of some of the meritorious actions of the Japanese government and people.</p>
<h3>Communist Party Attacked in French Election Campaign</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 20th] After the new French constitution was passed by referendum, a general election will be held in November of this year to form the National Assembly. The three major parties, namely the Popular Republican Movement, the Socialist Party, and the Communist Party, have launched election campaigns. The Popular Republican Movement is determined to form a party alone without seeking cooperation from the Communist Party. Chairman Schumann of the Popular Republican Movement declared in a campaign speech in Chives City yesterday, "We ask you to support our party and end the tripartite coalition government." At the same time, the chairman of the Socialist Party, the former Minister of Interior Troquet, delivered a speech in Nantes City, severely criticizing the Communist Party, believing that the Communist Party lacks independence. He said, "If the Communist Party is a domestic organization and does not follow foreign doctrines, and if the party embraces freedom first rather than the Soviet Union first, then the solidarity between the Socialist Party and the Communist Party can be reviewed." From the general trend, if the Socialist Party can control the Communist Party, it seems that it will join the government, and we can only support the Popular Republican Movement to form a party alone.</p>
<h3>Three Bombs Explode in the Stuttgart District</h3>
<p>Someone Plotting Against Schacht</p>
<p>[This newspaper news] London, 20th Broadcast: Three bombs exploded in the Stuttgart district, and US military buildings were damaged. The German police announced on Sunday night that this matter may be related to Schacht being in Stuttgart, and someone may want to release him or blow him up.</p>
<h3>Truth about Goering's Suicide</h3>
<p>Difficult to Complete Report Recently</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nuremberg, 19th United Press] The US military laboratory is expected to publish the final report on the qualitative test of the poison taken by Goering today, in order to complete the final official report on Goering's bizarre suicide case. Prison authorities refused to disclose exactly what this report might involve, but stated that this report is unlikely to be completed before the 22nd. It was originally hoped that the report of the investigative committee could be submitted today, but a laboratory expert had to go to Paris for an important task, and the nature of this important task was not disclosed, so the Goering suicide report will be delayed.</p>
<p>Berlin citizens held a large-scale demonstration holding red flags against the Nuremberg Tribunal's release of three Nazi war criminals, including Papen and Schacht. According to reports, this demonstration was launched by the Soviet Union.</p>

<h3>US State Department Reveals Eight-Point Economic Program</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 19th] Clayton, the economic assistant of the State Department, issued a statement today listing eight major points of US economic policy, namely (1) The United States supports the promotion of international commercial law. (2) The United States supports reducing tariffs and restricting preferential treatment systems. (3) Complete abolition of import quotas. (4) Suppression of collusion. (5) Establishment of agreements between countries to dispose of surplus raw materials. (6) Establishment of a pure commercial trading system for transactions between government agencies of various countries. (7) Establishment of an international trade organization by the United Nations Economic and Social Council. (8) All countries adopt laws to ensure the possibility of their people obtaining normal work.</p>
<p>Clayton also stated that although the United States has gained its current power during the war, it still does not harbor any economic imperialist ambitions. The United States has largely been an exporting country in the past, and now urgently wants to expand imports because it lacks raw materials such as manganese and tungsten. The disappearance of some of the United States' resources is partly due to the war. As for the currency issue, it is very important that foreign countries must pay in US dollars if they want to buy goods from the United States.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 19th United Press] US Assistant Secretary of State Clayton broadcast today that the United States' natural resources have been exhausted during the war, so it may soon be forced to rely on imports of raw materials from other countries. The main ones are copper, lead, zinc, and high-quality iron. The United States' copper reserves can only last for 25 to 30 years.</p>
<h3>UN General Assembly News, Please Listen to the Mandarin Broadcast</h3>

At that time, it will be broadcast simultaneously by three broadcast stations, with the radio call sign KNBA 9490 kilocycles, and the English of the United Nations Review will be added. The broadcast time to the Far East is 5:30 AM.</p>
<h3>Retrospect and Prospect of the Japanese Textile Industry</h3>
<p>[This newspaper Tokyo correspondent, 19th] The Japanese textile industry has a modern industrial form, starting between Meiji 25 and 29 (i.e., 1896). At that time, there were only 57 companies with 600,800 spindles. The United Kingdom and the United States had already established modern textile industries as early as 1846. In 1846, the United Kingdom had 15,554,619 spindles; the United States had 3.5 million spindles. The textile industry is one of Japan's central industries and has established the foundation for the Japanese Empire's outward expansion. The Japanese Empire started with light industry, and a history of the rise and fall of the Japanese Empire can be said to be a history of the development of the Japanese textile industry. Japan's first export of cotton cloth was to China, starting in Meiji 24 (1890). At that time, Japan experienced an economic panic, and sales stagnated, so it had to open up foreign markets. In that year, 6,435 catties of cotton cloth were shipped to China (each catty is 0.6 kilograms). With the expansion of commodity exports, capital exports followed. According to the statistics yearbook of the Diamond Economic Magazine: In Showa 15 (1939), there were 54 textile manufacturers in China (including the three northeastern provinces), with 2,223,200 spindles and 34,300 looms. The Japanese mainland textile industry was affected by the war, and many peace industries were converted into military industries. Moreover, due to air strikes, production plummeted. At the time of the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, it can be said that it was the most developed period of the Japanese textile industry. The number of spindles in operation in the mainland was 9,070,300, and the production of cotton yarn was 341,400 bales (400 pounds per bale). Currently, there are 13 manufacturers in the Japanese mainland with 3.5 million spindles; however, the number of spindles currently in operation is only 1.6 million. From October to December, it can be increased to 3.5 million spindles. Based on this number of spindles, 100,000 bales of cotton are required each month. The Japanese mainland does not produce cotton. Before the war, Japan imported most of its cotton from India and the United States. In Showa 12, when the Sino-Japanese War broke out, Japan imported 7,016,238 bales of Indian cotton. US cotton ranked second, with 4,223,964 bales. After the war, the first US cotton ship entered Japan in June. As of recently, 24 cotton ships have entered Japan, importing more than 500,000 bales of cotton. When the US cotton industry delegation arrived in Japan in March of this year, the Japanese side requested the US to import 890,000 bales of US cotton within this year. By June, it was known that the Japanese side's estimate was too large, and the Japanese manufacturers' production capacity could not digest this number, so it was changed to 314,000 bales. According to the Allied Supreme Headquarters plan, a total of 576,000 bales of US cotton can be shipped to Japan this year. At the beginning of the year, the Japanese side was very optimistic about the fiber industry, ranking the fiber industry first in the post-war economic recovery work; however, due to the shortage of labor and food, the production increase plan completely failed, and it was also restricted by the electricity supply. Other factors such as the shortage of coal and financial difficulties are also the biggest reasons for the decline of the fiber industry. The originally planned cotton consumption in August was 50,000 bales, but only 67% was consumed, totaling 33,000 bales. The consumption in September was 62,000 bales, but only 70% was consumed, totaling 40,000 bales. If this continues, it will inevitably affect the import of US cotton; the plan to export fiber products in exchange for food and other necessary materials will also be hindered. In view of this, the Japanese authorities, the Ministry of Commerce and Industry, held a meeting in Osaka the previous week, attended by representatives from MacArthur's Headquarters, Japanese government officials, local authorities, ten major manufacturers, and factory managers, and passed a proposal to promote the fiber industry, requesting the government to adopt and implement it, including six articles: (1) Guarantee the fiber industry as the most important industry, and give priority to obtaining the required materials; (2) Increase the food ration for fiber industry workers; (3) Pay part of the wages with factory-made products in kind; (4) Adjust the reconstruction funds for damaged factories; (5) Establish a cotton textile production technology promotion committee. The Japanese government convened a cabinet meeting on the 11th of this month to make concrete decisions on this case. The Toyo Keizai Weekly reported that experts are currently drafting a three-year plan for the revival of the fiber industry, predicting that the production of various textiles will reach 1 billion pounds in 1948, of which cotton textiles will reach 650 million pounds, rayon textiles will be 55 million pounds, artificial wool textiles will be 35 million pounds, wool textiles will be 36 million pounds, linen textiles will be 16 million pounds, and other textiles will be 35 million pounds.</p>
<p>Of this production volume, 40% is for export, 40% is for domestic consumption, and the other 20% is for raw materials. According to this plan, 52% of cotton textiles will be for export and 48% for domestic consumption; however, the quantity of cotton textiles planned for export cannot fully offset the domestic consumption of cotton. According to some opinions, this ratio may be changed, the import volume will be increased to 60%, and the domestic consumption volume will be 40%, that is, the export volume will reach 400 million pounds.</p>
<p>During the peak period of Japanese cotton cloth exports in Showa 12, approximately 648,572,000 pounds of cotton cloth were exported. If Japan's plan is realized, it will not only be a strong competitor to the Chinese textile industry, but also greatly affect the Indian textile industry; it is possible that this plan will be realized with international monopoly capital as its backing. At the same time, Japanese fiber industry equipment is not included in the first place of compensation. Recently, it has been generally believed in Washington that Japan will fulfill its guiding task in the post-war reconstruction of East Asia.</p>
<p>According to a United Press report from Washington on the 20th, Dr. John Staughton, a pastor of the American Baptist Church, after inspecting various parts of the Far East and returning to the United States, said in an interview: Japan seems to be a true victor, because their work of rebuilding the country and storing food is faster than that of the Philippines and China. It can be seen that this is the general opinion of the American government and public, and it is worthy of vigilance and effort from our textile industry.</p>

<h3>Using Small Radio Wave Detection Machines, the Security Department Smashed a Secret Radio Station in Lane 51, Jiangning Road; One Young Man, Rong Letian, Was Arrested; The Host, Wu Zhongwei, Is Still at Large</h3>
<p>[This newspaper news] The Songhu Garrison Headquarters, together with the Jiangning Road Police Station, smashed a secret radio station on the third floor of No. 152, Lane 51, Jiangning Road (i.e., Gordon Road) on the afternoon of the 8th of this month. A young man named Rong Letian, who was responsible for sending the reports, was arrested on the spot, but the host is still at large. It is only known that he is an elderly man, nearly sixty years old, named Wu Zhongwei. It has been found that the secret radio station has been established for nearly twenty days, and even the residents in the same house have not been able to understand the details. The place is a trading company dealing in import and export, named Yongchanglong. The manager, Cen Jiesheng, a native of Guangdong, has already left Shanghai for Hong Kong. All "business" is handled by the shop assistant Li Xianting. The arrested Rong Letian is also an employee of the shop. Therefore, whether it is related to the shop is still under investigation. The details of the smashing are as follows.</p>
<p>In view of the seriousness of the current situation, the authorities are deeply afraid that someone will take the opportunity to use telecommunications to engage in intelligence work. Therefore, technical methods were used to test the radio waves in the laboratory. Suddenly, a special fluctuation of radio waves was discovered in the southwest. Therefore, officers were dispatched with a mobile small radio wave detection machine in the direction of this radio wave to conduct preliminary detection work using the latest scientific methods. After several days of investigation, it was found that the secret radio station was located on Jiangning Road (i.e., Gordon Road) in West Shanghai. Therefore, a large number of technicians were added to intensify the investigation on Jiangning Road. When the staff passed Lane 51, Jiangning Road, the radio waves on the detection machine suddenly became clear, confirming that the secret radio station was located in the lane. Then, they continued to measure in the lane. When they reached No. 152, the radio waves on the detection machine became very obvious. Therefore, it was determined that the secret radio station was indeed in the room. At that time, because the layout was not perfect and they were afraid of alerting the enemy, they secretly marked the outside of the house. The next day, after contacting the Jiangning Road Police Station, a uniformed colonel led 16 military police officers to surround the place in three groups, leaving one group to guard the front and back doors, and the other two groups rushed in from the front and back doors. However, the secret workers in the room were still unaware of the situation. The investigators went straight to the third floor and found a young man sitting in front of the transmitter, engaging in broadcasting work. They immediately arrested him and seized the evidence. After interrogation, the suspect's name was Rong Letian. According to his confession, a large machine and more than ten pieces of application machinery were found in the wardrobe of the pavilion on the second floor. Because it was a matter of disrupting telecommunications and engaging in intelligence work and undermining national defense construction, the people and evidence were sent to the Military Law Department of the Garrison Headquarters for legal action. The authorities are now stepping up the search for the remaining accomplices in order to wipe them out and ensure the confidentiality of airborne telecommunications for national defense.</p>

<h3>Military and Police Riding Without Tickets Account for 10 Percent, Public Utilities Bureau Decides to Improve</h3>
<p>According to the Public Utilities Bureau, although the military, police, government officials, and teachers riding public vehicles in this city without tickets have been repeatedly announced to be prohibited by the military, police, and government authorities, this trend has not diminished. As a result, disputes such as beating ticket sellers have been heard from time to time. It even caused the suspension of all vehicles, affecting public transportation. Recently, the Public Utilities Bureau conducted a trial statistics on no-fare passengers on a selected day for its public buses. The results showed that the average for each route was about 10 percent. Among them, Route 4 from Hongkou and Gaolang Bridge to the Bund on Beijing Road, and Route 7 from Hongkou Central Park to Zha Pu Road Bridge were the most. Route 4 accounted for slightly less than 19 percent of all passengers, while Route 7 accounted for as much as 47 percent. The purpose of the Bureau's operation of the public bus business is to facilitate the citizens and serve the public. Such a phenomenon affects both public operations and public welfare. The Public Utilities Bureau is paying close attention to this and still plans to consult with the military, police, and other authorities to discuss detailed measures and thoroughly improve it.</p>

<h3>The Hualian Ship Sets Sail Today on Its Maiden Voyage to Tianjin. The China United Company Hosted Reporters for a Visit Yesterday Afternoon.</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] China United Enterprise Company was established during the Anti-Japanese War in the 27th year and made many contributions in the rear. After the victory, it moved to Shanghai and actively engaged in business. In addition to founding a public bus company in Hangzhou to serve urban transportation, it also fully engaged in shipping business, ordering more than ten giant ships from Australia one after another. Among them, the Shilian and Guolian freighters have already arrived in China and joined the North Sea route. Recently, another Hualian passenger ship has arrived and also participated in the North Sea route, mainly for passengers. The company invited the press for a visit at 4 p.m. yesterday. Dozens of people attended. The company's Deputy General Manager Long Shengzhi, the ship's purser Li Yisheng, and many other senior company officials hosted the guests on board and guided them to visit various departments. The ship has a total tonnage of 3,500 tons, a draft of 18 feet, a speed of 17 nautical miles per hour, three engines, a length of 350 feet, and a width of 40 feet. There are 460 special-class passenger seats, about 100 first- and second-class seats, no third-class facilities, and 300 fourth-class seats. The berth equipment and the dining room and smoking room of the first class are all arranged like a mail ship, so when the passengers are full, it can only load 700 tons of cargo. The ship is painted blue, with two smokestacks and eight lifeboats on the left and right, plus one on the stern, for a total of nine. The exterior is very beautiful and can be called a small mail ship. According to the ship's speed, it will take one week to travel between Shanghai and Tianjin.

<h3>The Fuel Management Committee Does Not Intend to Supply Anthracite Coal for Winter Stoves</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] According to the person in charge of the Shanghai District Fuel Management Committee of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, the committee has never lacked the supply of coal for public utilities, water and electricity companies, shipping companies, and other agencies. The municipal authorities' saving of electricity and limiting of electricity use is not due to a shortage of fuel, but because of the limited power generation capacity. Some users in this city waste a lot of electricity, and saving electricity is indeed necessary. The committee does not intend to supply anthracite coal for this year's winter stoves, mainly because of the shortage of anthracite coal. The committee does not have this stock of coal, and the transportation in North China is blocked, making the source of coal feel quite difficult. In the future, if the coal source is smooth or purchased from overseas, it will try to supply it as much as possible. However, priority will be given to those who need it.</p>
<h3>Advertising Extensively in Foreign Newspapers, Airmail Purchase Turned Out to Be a Scam, No One Accepted the Remittance, Hotel Accountant Recognized the Hidden Truth</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] He Jisheng, a 36-year-old man from Anhui, rented Room 36 of the Jiahe Travel Agency on Fujian Road as a long-term room. A month ago, he suddenly had a whimsical idea and falsely claimed to have established the Da Zhonghua Company in the Da Zhong Hotel at 243 Zhongzheng Road, specializing in selling Mao Bijie, ballpoint pens, and scientific red gold rings. He entrusted people to publish large advertisements in local newspapers in Wuchang, Yuanling, and other places, attracting foreign customers with extremely low prices and airmail purchases. A remittance of more than 100,000 yuan was transferred from the Central Trust Bureau to the Da Zhong Hotel, but the accounting room refused to accept it because the Da Zhonghua Company was not established there. At the same time, letters ordering goods poured in from Hunan and other places, and the telegraph was very busy. At about 1 p.m. yesterday afternoon, He ordered his accomplice Liang Shengying (30 years old, operating a cigarette paper shop) to go to the Da Zhong Hotel to inquire about the news. He was seen through by the accountant Wang Huaitang, who handed him over to the police station. He confessed that it was all done by He Jisheng, who claimed to be the general manager. The staff member Song Yuanshan, the police chief Han Zuchen, and the plainclothes police officer Ju Xingmei rushed to the Jiahe Travel Agency to arrest He and seized a large number of foreign newspapers with advertisements, promotional materials, and envelopes and stationery printed with the words "Da Zhonghua Company", and took them to the bureau for interrogation and investigation.</p>
<h3>Winter Relief for the Poor to Begin Next Month</h3>

<h3>The Inside Story of Shanghai's Pickpocket Party (1)</h3>
<p>— Huang Jiamo</p>
<p>Bred and Growing in the Concession Era</p>
<p>In recent months, the Shanghai Police Bureau has made a major determination to eliminate the "pickpocket party." Under several swift and forceful searches and arrests, more than 100 people have been caught. This pickpocket party is like a centipede clinging to the city of Shanghai. In the past concession era, the police power was controlled by foreigners. The so-called "patrol room" and the inflexibility of the police structure were the main factors that created the deeply rooted pickpocket party. The "Uncle Gang" (the nickname for the big and small bosses in the gang) relied on "Bai Xiang people" to associate with some criminal chiefs and translators in the patrol room, and they were surprisingly powerful (the insider term is "Dou De Zhuan"), fearless (the insider term is "Wen Zhao Pai Tou").</p>
<p>Targeting Our Fellow Countrymen</p>
<p>In the era when foreigners ruled the concessions, they paid the most attention to the safety and welfare of foreign expatriates. As for the interests of the Chinese people living in the concessions, they were indifferent.</p>
<p>The people in the "pickpocket party" were well aware of this distorted situation, so the opponents they picked pockets from and robbed were not "red hairs" or "old hairs" (both names for foreigners), but specifically targeted the pitiful "fellow countrymen". This was the main creed of the gang's activities. They were all rogues who "lacked food and clothing" anyway, so they only talked about interests and not about etiquette. Can we still blame them harshly?</p>
<p>This relationship of interests is very simple. If a foreigner was pickpocketed, the patrol room in charge of the area would have to handle the matter officially. As a result, those patrol chiefs, second chiefs, and third chiefs who usually sat and received peaceful salaries would have to go out to investigate and handle the case. In fact, it would be found out as soon as they investigated. At that time, in addition to secretly "vomiting out the stolen goods", they would inevitably arrest a few thieves and detain them for investigation. This would turn into stealing chickens and losing rice, which would be quite troublesome. Therefore, the people in the dark of the patrol room often "admonished" the heads of the gang, "Do not attack 'old hairs', so as not to cause suffering and trouble for everyone."</p>
<p>At that time, the white overseas Chinese people were not blessed with the same "immunity" rights, because the White Russian people did not have extraterritoriality, and they had not yet received the protection of the Soviet official. The pickpocket party knew the international situation well, so the White Russian people residing in the old "French Concession" also enjoyed the right to be pickpocketed like our fellow countrymen.</p>
<p>During the Japanese Occupation</p>
<p>Since the Pacific War, the Japanese pirates occupied the ruling power of the "concession," and the police government became more corrupt and dark. During the war, the pickpocket party took advantage of the chaos to fish in troubled waters and rob while the fire was burning. They really "made a lot of money every day." It was truly the most triumphant era in the half-century of the pickpocket party's activities. The British and Americans all entered concentration camps, and the enemy became the ruling class. The people in the gang recognized the enemy as the "boss" and did not dare to attack the Japanese easily. This is the pickpocket party's ability to cater to the trend, and it is the party's ability to use its adaptability to deal with the world.</p>
<p>The Japanese pirates have always boasted of their police government, so why did they get into a dead end after ruling the "concession"? There were indeed many deficiencies in the objective conditions. The most important reason was that there were insufficient manpower, so they had to continue to rely on the group of people left over from the "patrol room" era. This group of people colluded with the gang as usual to obtain illegal profits, and at the same time, they were unwilling to cooperate sincerely with the Japanese police government, so-called "concealing from the superiors but not from the subordinates." At the time of the war, everyone only wanted to take the opportunity to "make a fortune," and the Japanese pirates had to sigh helplessly here!</p>
<p>Uncle Recruits Soldiers to Open Up a Way Out</p>
<p>The predecessor of the Shanghai pickpocket party was the "Old Brothers Gang," which was originally a special product of Shanghai, a group of paupers, commonly known as "Bie San." This group was originally a parasitic and fallen beggar living in the city, with disheveled hair and dirty faces, wandering the streets all day long. However, the number of young and strong people in the beggar gang was increasing, and they could not bear the difficult life of begging. The "Uncle Gang" in the gang took the opportunity to recruit soldiers and horses, train this street fresh force, and became today's pickpocket party.</p>
<p>The pickpocket party takes the principle of taking risks as its activity. Relying on the special environment of the "concession" and the help of "co-picking brothers" (the so-called cooperative partners), they actually opened up a way out and monopolized the pickpocket market. "Black-hearted copper coins" (unjust wealth) rolled in, and the people in the gang gradually "wore silk and ate oil", and transformed themselves into one of the four people. Of course, they were very proud to see those former peers who were dressed in rags and ate cold rice. How could the beggar gang not be envious? Therefore, those beggars with "enterprising minds" also followed suit, striving for a way out. Only the old and weak who had no future were supporting the begging business.</p>
<h3>A List of Forced Sales Calls: 13 Telephone Numbers Actually Cost 2,000 Yuan</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] When moving to residential areas in this city, there are often three or two uninvited guests who drive bicycles to households with telephones in various alleys and forcibly sell "emergency telephone directories" printed with lead skin. The table is 3 inches long and 2 inches wide. It is printed in red with 13 telephone numbers of the police station and fire brigade. The thin piece actually costs 2,000 yuan. They are also aggressive, claiming to be sent by the telephone company and must be bought, etc. After reporters inquired with the telephone company, they learned that the company had never sent anyone to sell any items to users. Fortunately, telephone users should not be fooled by them. If they are found again, they can be handed over to the nearby police station for handling.</p>
<h3>Can the Fish Market Truck with a White Flag Be Permanently Exempt from Disputes?</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] There were disputes between tricycle and truck drivers due to competition for the fish market business. Yesterday morning, they had another conflict due to business relations. Later, the fish market authorities mediated and decided that all trucks should hang the white flag of the fish market and be operated by the fish market. From yesterday, fishmongers taking rides will not be charged any fees. This is a temporary transitional measure, and the outcome depends on the negotiations between the tricycle drivers and the truck drivers.</p>
<h3>The Case of the Tragic Death of Zang Da's Second Son: The Witness Safely Returned Home, the Tricycle Driver Flew to Qingdao on a Special Plane, and Once Boarded a US Warship to Identify the Murderer</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Regarding the tragic case of the rickshaw puller Zang Da's second son being shot to death, the suspect, the Spaniard Lai Luns, has been arrested and transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office for interrogation, but the murderer has not yet been identified. In order to investigate the truth, the US military took Liao Yuanshou, the tricycle driver who witnessed the case, away for questioning on the evening of the 14th of this month. The next day, they specially prepared a plane with number 50854 and sent personnel to accompany Liao to Qingdao to identify the American soldiers who committed the crime on various warships. On the warship numbered "863", he caught sight of a burly man, who was pointed out by Liao as the murderer. However, the soldier firmly denied it. Because of his flustered expression, he is now under thorough investigation by the US side. Liao was sent back to Shanghai on a special US plane the night before and returned home safely. Liao has also reported the case to the police station for the record yesterday.</p>
<h3>The Enemy Property Administration Tightens the Scope and Reduces Local Offices in Batches</h3>
<p>Reverse Property Handling Committees Will Be Established on a Provincial Basis</p>
<p>The handling work of the offices and sub-offices of the Enemy and Puppet Property Administration Bureau in Suzhou, Zhejiang, and Anhui will soon be completed one after another. In order to tighten up, the bureau is preparing to reduce these offices in batches within this month after considering the situation, so as to gradually achieve the end stage.</p>
<p>Proposed End Principles</p>
<p>It is reported that the bureau has formulated the end principles for the offices and sub-offices in various provinces and cities: (1) Regarding the remaining materials, they should be sold and auctioned as soon as possible. If they have no economic value, they should be identified by local auditing, public opinion, court, and supervisory agencies, and then reported for cancellation after clarifying the responsibilities. (2) The enemy and puppet factories temporarily managed by the sub-offices will be handed over to the provincial and municipal offices for management. Those managed by the provincial and municipal offices will be handed over to the bureau for management and will be priced and sold immediately after being taken over. (3) The enemy and puppet real estate can be handed over to the local Central Trust Bureau for management. If there is no Central Trust Bureau, it can be handed over to the relevant local authorities for management and transferred to the Reverse Property Handling Committee for handling after the committee is established. (5) In terms of personnel, each sub-office should retain staff who have handled the above items and other special unfinished cases for transfer to the provincial and municipal offices for continued handling, but each office is limited to three people, and the rest will be dismissed. (6) After the files of each sub-office are closed, they can be concentrated in the provincial and municipal offices. When the provincial and municipal offices are closed, they will be concentrated in the bureau.

<h3>Forging of Road Bureau's Chen Bozhuang's Seal; Hangzhou Arrests Young Swindler</h3>
<p>The Police Department of the Beijing-Shanghai Railway Administration recently cracked a case involving the private engraving of the signature seal of Chen Bozhuang, Director of the Bureau, and the forging of official documents such as the Bureau's official seal. A suspect who used these for fraudulent purposes was arrested. The Hangzhou Substation of the Bureau's Police Department discovered a suspicious young man at the station. After questioning, a forged "Beijing-Shanghai Railway Administration Accountant" assignment order was found on his person, and he was immediately taken to the station for interrogation. The suspect confessed that his name was Cheng Deguang, and that he had served as a communications police chief in a certain unit, but was now unemployed. When he came to Hangzhou last month, he met his former superior, Guo Yuqin, who claimed to be the head of the Accounting Department of the Two Roads Administration. Cheng then bribed him with over 200,000 legal tender yuan to introduce him to a job. He also introduced four others, including Shi Jing, to Guo for job introductions. Guo then issued assignment orders on October 17th and claimed that he had received a telegram from Guo, who told them they could get travel expenses. Chen, the substation chief, found his words ambiguous and untrustworthy, so he sent Inspector Luo Zengji to the suspect's residence at the Central Hotel to investigate and continued to invite the four people, including Shi Jingchang, who had been introduced for work. After questioning, the four people, including Shi, realized that they had been deceived by Cheng and stated that they had paid Cheng over one million legal tender yuan. They were immediately taken to the station for further questioning. Based on the confessions, a search was conducted, and the suspect's hidden "Beijing-Shanghai Railway Administration" seal and Director Chen Bozhuang's signature seal were found in a ditch next to a garbage pile at the Hangzhou Railway Station. Further interrogation revealed that the cash had been given to Guo Yuqin, who had taken it to Shanghai, but Guo's address was unknown. The Bureau's Police Department, considering the suspect's forgery of seals and fraudulent acquisition of money, detained him with the evidence and sent him to the Hangzhou District Court for legal proceedings.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Housing Shortage: Living Like Sardines in a Can</h3>
<p>In Shanghai, "every inch of land is worth its weight in gold," making housing a very serious problem. Although there are many garden villas and skyscrapers that adorn this world-class metropolis, most citizens can only live in cage-like houses, not only suffering from the oppression of big and small landlords but also often quarreling with their neighbors.</p>
<p>Shanghai's housing problem began after the rapid increase in population. In the early days of opening the port, the concession restricted Chinese residents. In 1845, Gong Muju of the Su-Song-Tai Circuit and British Consul Balfour signed the first Land Regulations for the Concession, which stipulated that "Chinese people shall not lease or sell land or houses within the concession to Chinese people, and foreigners shall not build houses within the concession and lease them to Chinese people for residence." Originally, this was purely a piece of rural land with mud, swamps, graves, and grass huts, and there were not many residents. With the added restrictions, except for servants employed by Westerners, only a few Chinese shops supplied Westerners with daily necessities. In 1853, there were no more than 500 Chinese people in the concession. In that year, the Small Swords Society occupied Shanghai City, and residents flocked to the concession to take refuge, building temporary houses to live in. Therefore, in 1854, the number of Chinese people in the concession had increased to 20,000, and Chinese and foreigners began to live together. In July of that year, the consuls of Britain, the United States, and France re-drafted the Land Regulations, tacitly acknowledging that Chinese people could live in the concession. In 1855, the Shanghai Daotai officially announced that Chinese people would be allowed to live in the concession in the future, provided they abide by the Land Regulations and pay taxes to the Public Works Department. This was the beginning of Chinese people officially residing in the concession.</p>
<p>From then on, the number of Westerners coming to Shanghai increased daily, and Chinese people gradually moved into the concession, either for business convenience or because the Chinese areas were unstable. The population of the concession grew day by day. According to a previous report by the Public Works Department, from 1965 to 1935, the population of the Public Concession increased from more than 90,000 to 1.15 million. The concession authorities repeatedly expanded the area and built houses to accommodate this large population. Taking the former Public Concession as an example, in 1925, there were more than 72,000 residential buildings, 3,400 were added in 1926, and 2,400 were added in 1927. More were added in subsequent years. Many people also lived in Zhabei, Nanshi, and the nearby suburbs. However, the expansion of the urban area was subject to considerable restrictions, and the construction of houses could not increase proportionally with the population. Therefore, Shanghai's housing problem has never been reasonably resolved.</p>
<p>After the "August 13th" Incident, Shanghai was occupied by the enemy, leaving only a small concession. Residents of Zhabei, Nanshi, and the suburbs flocked in, and at the same time, many people from the occupied areas concentrated in Shanghai, resulting in a serious housing shortage. After the victory, the order in the recovered areas has not yet been restored, and the people who took refuge in Shanghai still have to live there. And the people who were in the rear during the war flocked to Shanghai, but many destroyed houses in the Chinese area could not be built up in a short time. The housing shortage is more serious than during the "isolated island" period. Now the world is experiencing a housing shortage, not just Shanghai. But how will Shanghai solve this housing problem for its citizens?</p>
<h3>Lane Houses and Western-Style Houses</h3>
<p>The most common type of housing in Shanghai is the lane house, which evolved from old-style Chinese houses. Old-style buildings were all several rooms in a row, small ones with three rooms, large ones with five or seven rooms, and palaces with as many as thirteen rooms. Shanghai houses are modified from the old style, with living rooms, bedrooms, kitchens, and patios, everything that is needed, and there are separate doors for entering and exiting, forming independent units. The earliest buildings were mostly two or three buildings connected to form units, the so-called "stone gate houses." As for single buildings, they are mostly inhabited by common people in less convenient areas. There is also a type of Cantonese-style house without a patio in front, also known as "Eastern-style houses," which is not very popular.</p>
<p>Later, with gradual progress, lane houses also became more novel. The height increased from two to three stories. In addition to water and electricity, there were also sanitary facilities. The internal structure became more Westernized, and the appearance was more sophisticated, with English, French, Spanish, and three-dimensional styles, etc. These new-style houses are located in areas that have shifted with the expansion of the city, with a quieter environment and higher rents.</p>
<h3>Western-Style Residences</h3>
<p>Western-style residences were initially limited to foreign residents. Later, many noble Chinese people also began to live in "Western-style houses." However, Chinese people's habits are ultimately different from those of Westerners, and they feel that Western-style houses have many places that are not suitable for Chinese people's use. Therefore, only a very small number of fashionable people live in them. At the same time, although they live in Western-style houses, they actually preserve many Chinese quintessences. Many wealthy businessmen buy land and build their own houses. Although the outside is Western-style, the inside has been changed to Chinese style, and even the exterior has a bit of Chinese flavor.</p>
<p>The earliest Western-style houses were very large, similar to Chinese houses, with large lawns and gardens. Later, the area gradually shrank. In the past, one or two acres of land would only be used to build one house, but now seven or eight houses can be built. Although this is the trend all over the world, it is also because the land price is too high.</p>
<h3>The Style of Western-Style Houses</h3>
<p>Although Western-style houses are noble, people in the city have high mobility, and most of them are leased. As for building one's own house, it is often more shabby than leasing. Although you can't see anything from the outside, the interior decoration is worlds apart. The private residences of wealthy Shanghai merchants are magnificent inside, even surpassing the residences of emperors. The indoor lighting and colors are full of artistic atmosphere, the marble steps are inlaid by famous artists, the ceilings are full of colored patterns, and the walls are inlaid with wooden pieces with contrasting patterns. There are water heaters in winter and air conditioning in summer, and even dance halls, theaters, elevators, and other facilities are fully equipped. The residences of servants are beyond the reach of middle-class families.</p>
<h3>The Development of Residential Areas: From East to West</h3>
<p>The Shanghai market has gradually developed from east to west. The Henan Road area was originally a ball-throwing field, but later became a bustling area. Residential areas gradually expanded westward, but only to the racecourse. In the early years of the Republic of China, Bubbling Well Road was still called New Road, and there were few houses. The only place where tourists gathered was near Zhang Garden, which was considered very far. At that time, there were wars everywhere, so more and more people moved to Shanghai with their families. The number of buildings on Yu Garden Road increased with each year, and it became the most noble residential area, replacing the old Boone Road. At that time, people called Yu Garden Road the "essence" of Shanghai, with rows of mansions, all the homes of wealthy families, which can be imagined its prosperity. When the Japanese invaders entered the concession, the western part of Shanghai suddenly became "bad land." Those living in the former Public Concession were wary and moved to better places. Thus, the former French Concession arose. Today, the area from Avenue Petain to Route Ferguson has replaced Yu Garden Road. The roads are lined with lush trees, and the roads are as smooth as mirrors, where officials and nobles come and go.</p>
<h3>A House in the Early Republic: Monthly Rent of Eight Yuan</h3>
<p>In the early years of the Republic of China, renting a house in the most bustling section of the Nanshi Alley Road cost eight yuan a month, and you could get a new house with two floors, up and down. Even in the New Road area, it was only about ten yuan a month. If it was more than twenty yuan, it was considered unbearable. In the fifteenth and sixteenth years of the Republic of China, it was still around fifty or sixty yuan, and the key money was only one or two hundred yuan. This refers to ordinary households. In the Yu Garden Road area, where Westerners lived, most of the rents were calculated in silver dollars, and few people inquired. Moreover, without a private car, it was impossible to reach directly, and manpower was generally insufficient. Later, when public buses became available, there were occasional lane houses for rent, and more people moved in. This is roughly how the Shanghai residential area shifted from east to west.</p>
<h3>Cage-Like Housing: Fifteen Families Lived in One House</h3>
<p>Shanghai has such a large population and the housing problem is so difficult to solve. To what extent has the overcrowding reached? According to the Public Works Department's household survey in 1930, there were 1,159,775 people in the concession, living on an area of 5,723 acres, with an average population density of 200 people per acre. But this is still the overall calculation, and some of the houses are used for industry and commerce. In addition, there are many wealthy merchants with large houses, and with lawns and gardens, only a few people live there. The former Public Concession Public Works Department organized a committee to investigate the living conditions. This committee submitted a report in 1937. According to the report, in the concession, there were 22,764 houses with four families living in each house, 14,028 houses with six families living in each house, and 1,305 houses with more than nine families living in each house. The most, one house, has housed 15 families.</p>
<p>Before the war, in the twenty-fourth and fifth years of the Republic of China, Shanghai's housing opened up a new path, developing suburban new village construction movement. At that time, the Rose Garden New Village was the largest and most perfect (see picture), but unfortunately, after the outbreak of the war, it was destroyed by artillery fire. Now that Shanghai is experiencing a severe housing shortage, why hasn't anyone advocated this movement?</p>
<h3>Unthinkable</h3>
<p>It is hard to imagine how fifteen families can live in a small, single building. It really becomes a cage. A reporter from a certain newspaper calculated the distribution of a building: the living room downstairs is divided into front and rear parts, with two families living in each part; the kitchen is converted into a room, with one family living there; the front patio is covered with a shed, with one family living there; the upstairs living room is divided into front and rear parts, with two families living in each part; the pavilion room above the kitchen has one family living there; a loft is built in the sloping part of the roof ridge, with one family living there; the sun deck is covered with a shed, with one family living there; a loft is also built in the middle of the half-stairway, with one family living there; and in the corner opposite the stairway, a single bed can fit, which also counts as one family; and under the stairway, there is another family living there, for a total of twelve families. As for how a house can house fifteen families, it is really a bit "unthinkable."</p>
<p>Shanghai's overcrowding is indeed a major social problem, directly hindering the health and well-being of residents, shortening their lifespan, and also affecting national morals and ethics, as well as social order and tranquility. However, Shanghai citizens are very fortunate to be able to obtain even a small room. How can they calculate other things? Social progress has certainly prospered the city, but whether this is human happiness needs to be evaluated separately.</p>
<h3>Is Shanghai a Good Place to Live?</h3>
<p>Since housing in Shanghai is so unreasonable and causes difficulties, why do so many people come to Shanghai in batches, which is a bit puzzling. The question is "Is Shanghai a good place to live?" This question has been used as a topic for debate twice. Once at the YMCA on April 10th of the thirty-third year of the Republic of China, and again at the Youth Middle School in June of the same year.</p>
<p>Looking at the Good Side</p>
<p>From the good side: Shanghai is the largest city in the country, and industry, culture, and transportation are all centered in Shanghai. The influence of world civilization and the infusion of science. Shanghai also gets the first taste of the trend. In terms of construction, there are neat streets and tall houses. Urban transportation is convenient, and there are many vehicles like dragons crossing the river. All material civilization is beyond the reach of other places. Even the beggars on the streets have more opportunities to receive relief from charitable organizations than in other places.</p>
<p>Saying it from the Opposite Side</p>
<p>From the opposite side: Shanghai is a small place with five million people living there, and the degree of overcrowding is equal to the extreme. The sanitation facilities have not yet reached a perfect state. Although the surface is a scene of prosperity, in fact, it is full of darkness and has become a hotbed of crime. Everywhere is a place to tempt young people to fall, and even if they are not buried in the den of demons, the spiritual pain they suffer cannot be compensated by material enjoyment.</p>
<h3>Towering Apartments</h3>
<p>Shanghai is precisely constructed by these positive and negative sides. But people who come to Shanghai rarely look at it from this perspective. People who have never been there think that Shanghai is full of gold, which can be picked up everywhere. I don't know that Shanghai has thirty-three heavens and also eighteen layers of hell. The number of people stranded in Shanghai is even greater. Shanghai has the advantages of a city, but it cannot be denied that there are many stains. To maintain the status of this world-class city, how should we improve and compensate for its defects?</p>
<p>Shanghai land prices rise with the increase in population, which has the greatest impact on buildings. To accommodate more people on a small piece of land, we can only build skyscrapers that occupy the sky but not the land. The Park Hotel next to the racecourse, the Broadway Mansion on the Bund, and the Bank of China on the Bund can be considered skyscrapers in Shanghai. But compared with New York, they are still like a small witch meeting a big witch. Initially, these tall buildings were limited to public places such as offices and hotels. The Lou Wai Lou near the Risheng Building on the Great Road once caused a sensation. People used to climb the eight-story building of the China United Apartment Corporation on the Double Ninth Festival. Slowly, this kind of large building was used as a residence, called an apartment.</p>
<p>Apartments</p>
<p>Are all large buildings with more than three floors, each floor is divided into several houses for rent separately. Each house has a bedroom and living room, as well as a kitchen, bathroom, and storage room. Some bedrooms have several rooms, while larger ones have dining rooms, study rooms, and servant rooms. The content of apartments is different from ordinary residences. They are all large buildings made of steel and cement, with elevators and heating. The interiors of the rooms have teak furniture, mica stone fireplace mantels, and built-in wardrobes. Bathtubs, electric stoves, refrigerators, and all kinds of equipment are available. The rent includes house tax, heating, hot and cold water, and other expenses. If the number of rooms is the same, it is about one or two times more expensive than a new-style lane house.</p>
<p>Before the tenth year of the Republic of China, there were few high-end apartments, only on Jing'an Temple Road, Haig Road, Yu Garden Road, and Avenue Joffre. Most of the residents were foreigners, and some even refused to rent to Chinese people. From the nineteenth to the twenty-fourth year, apartment buildings sprang up like mushrooms after a rain, mostly in the western section of Avenue Joffre, near Avenue Petain, and in the western part of Shanghai. Towering buildings and pavilions rise above the clouds, fully demonstrating the vigorous development of the city.</p>
<p>Lane-Style Apartments</p>
<p>In the development of apartment buildings, there is also a type of lane-style apartment. In the new-style lane, the downstairs facing the street is used as a store, and the upper floors are converted into apartments. These apartments are mostly three-story buildings, which are actually part of the lane, and the format and capacity are the same. The equipment is slightly inferior to that of the mansion-style apartments, and the rent is also cheaper. These lane-style apartments are rare in Shanghai and are mostly located in the border area.</p>
<p>Building apartments can save space and increase the number of residences in prosperous cities. However, the luxurious equipment and high rents still make ordinary people flinch. If the area, size, and land price can be surveyed and the number of floors can be determined, without any waste in each house, and the equipment can be as simple as possible, the rent can be reduced so that ordinary citizens can enjoy it, which will definitely help solve the urban housing problem.</p>
<p>Hell in Paradise!</p>
<h3>Hell in Paradise: A Few Reed Mats and a Few Bundles of Straw - Poorer Than Pigs and Sheep</h3>
<p>Exquisite bungalows and towering skyscrapers adorn this city. But on the outskirts abandoned by the city, there are still many thatched huts, which are a stark contrast to the tall buildings. These thatched huts are scattered in Yangshupu, Caojiadu, North Xinjing, Zhabei, and other areas. Looking at the life of the shantytown dwellers, it is hard to believe that in the paradise of Shanghai, there would be such a hell on earth.</p>
<p>Most of the shantytown dwellers have drifted from their barren hometowns to this glorious city due to the threat of severe cold. But this huge Shanghai cannot accommodate them. So, with a few reed mats and a few bundles of straw, they established their dwellings. They don't have to spend money to hire plasterers, and they don't have to consult engineers. In this five or six square foot area, which is not even shoulder-high, the whole family lives, eats, and sleeps. It goes without saying that the light is dim and the ground is damp. Once there is a strong wind and rain, living in a thatched hut is not much different from sleeping in the open.</p>
<p>According to a survey conducted by the Public Security and Social Affairs Bureaus in the 25th year of the Republic of China, there were more than 20,000 shantytown households, with about 100,000 people. Those in the concession are not included. This is a stain on the city. To solve this problem, the then municipal government established the Citizen Welfare Undertakings Management Committee to build civilian residences to help these civilians struggling for life.</p>
<h3>Civilian New Village</h3>
<p>The first civilian village built was on Qimei Road, with more than 200 houses, divided into Type A and Type B. The light was sufficient and the air was well-circulated, which was a world of difference compared to the pigsty-like thatched huts. In addition, there were civilian primary schools, bathrooms, auditoriums, clinics, cooperatives, sports fields, and other facilities, which were well-planned and benefited the civilians a lot. Later, 123 acres of land were opened up on Zhongshan Road, Damuqiao, Pushan Road, and other places to build a thousand houses. Although this was achieved through the great efforts of the authorities, it was still far from the required number. Unfortunately, the artillery fire of August 13th drove the residents of the civilian new village back into the thatched huts.</p>
<h3>The Darlings of Heaven, the Sub-Landlords, Still Make the Third-Tier Tenants Miserable</h3>
<p>Shanghai's population continues to increase, and the need for housing is very urgent. Many people build houses to rent out for profit. Land and houses are a commodity in Shanghai.</p>
<p>The properties owned by the owners are often divided into many units for rent. Each building in the lane forms a unit. Since the owners are unwilling to do this trivial work of dividing the houses like citizens, many people rent the houses and then sublet part of them to others, which gives rise to the so-called "sub-landlords" and "third-tier tenants." Initially, there were really surplus houses when subletting. In times of housing surplus, the sub-landlords often faced the risk of having to pay the rent out of their own pockets. At the same time, the tenants were of mixed quality, and some even rented houses in the name of robbery. Therefore, they were unwilling to openly post rental notices. But later, there were fewer houses and more people, and the supply fell short of demand, and the sub-landlords became the "darlings of heaven." The rent collected by the sub-landlord from a building, in addition to paying the rent and utilities to the landlord, can not only allow the sub-landlord to live for free, but also have a surplus. In the few years when Shanghai was an "isolated island," the sub-landlord's family could rely entirely on this building to solve their livelihood. The third-tier tenants aggravated the exploitation, and the landlords also suffered losses.</p>
<p>In a situation where the supply of houses cannot meet the demand, many strange things often happen. When the landlords see that the sub-landlords are making money, they also try to raise the rent. However, the landlord only raises the rent by five yuan, but the sub-landlord charges more than twenty yuan. The wool comes from the sheep, and the miserable ones are still the third-tier tenants. The third-tier tenants also try to become landlords, subletting the rented houses to others, which gives rise to "third-tier landlords" and "fourth-tier tenants." The most interesting thing is that a third-tier tenant built a loft in a relatively large kitchen and sublet it to a fourth-tier tenant, not only can the third-tier tenant not pay rent, but also earns more than ten yuan a month. This was in the past, and it is even more different now.</p>
<h3>Rent and Key Money</h3>
<p>Although Shanghai citizens live in such cramped conditions, the burden of rent is not small. Originally, when landlords build houses, they naturally have to calculate their costs, such as land price, construction costs, equipment costs, repair insurance and other expenses, as well as depreciation reserves. Based on the capital paid, they calculate the rent to seek reasonable profits. This is the most legitimate approach. However, when supply and demand are not in harmony, the leasing relationship is not so simple.</p>
<p>The majority of citizens do not rent houses directly from the landlords, but rather from sub-landlords. These sub-landlords rely on the scarcity of housing to profit from it, causing citizens to pay higher rents. In the landlord's eyes, this is a loss. When one cannot find a house to rent, the landlords are naturally unwilling to easily let go of this opportunity. When renting houses directly from the landlord, one must spend an extra sum of money. In the past, it was several hundreds of yuan at the lower end, and several thousands of yuan at the higher end. After the victory, it was even calculated in "slips," and was called "key money" or "small rent." Key money was originally the name for the transfer of some non-removable decorations, etc., left by the previous tenant to the next tenant. However, often even for an empty house with nothing in it, they would demand a sum of key money from you.</p>
<p>Key money originally came from the relationship between the previous and next tenants, so initially it was only a transaction between tenants. The landlord would sometimes act as a "matchmaker." Later, it gradually deteriorated in quality. An empty house, even just a room, or even a non-empty one, was all considered a way to make money. Tenants occupy the house and are unwilling to give it up, and the landlord tries every possible means to force the tenant out. Thus, disputes between landlords and tenants over leasing relationships emerge endlessly. If there is a fixed-term lease, the date of expiration is the time when disputes arise. If there is no fixed-term lease, there are also cases where the tenant is asked to move out under the pretext of taking it back for self-use, or the tenant is forced to move out by raising the rent. Landlords treat tenants this way, and sub-landlords treat sub-tenants the same way.</p>
<h3>A Contradictory Phenomenon</h3>
<p>It is not easy to live in Shanghai, but on the other hand, there are many empty houses waiting to be rented. The former Shanghai Municipal Council of the International Settlement once published an accurate statistic: In 1920, empty Chinese-style houses in the settlement accounted for 0.8%, increasing to 4.1% in 1927, and 5.3% in 1934; unrented Western-style houses accounted for 2.3% in 1920, increasing to 8.2% in 1926, and 14% in 1934. Over the decades, the increase in Shanghai's population has clearly exceeded the increase in housing, so the imbalance between supply and demand is a natural phenomenon. Why are there so many empty houses unattended? It can be seen that Shanghai's housing problem is not only a matter of insufficient supply, but also a matter of uneven distribution. High rents and shocking key money force citizens to tighten their belts and live in a corner. In 1936, Mr. Pike, a former member of the Housing Committee of the Shanghai Municipal Council, gave a speech on the housing problem, pointing out that "the decrease in citizens' income has led to an increase in the number of people living together in houses. Landlords should be urged to reduce rents so that houses are not vacant. This is the fundamental way to prosper Shanghai."</p>
<p>Advertisements for Key Money Are Everywhere</p>
<p>At present, Shanghai is facing a serious housing shortage, so there should no longer be any vacant houses. However, when we open the newspapers, advertisements for rent and key money occupy many pages every day. The Tongyu Chun Tea House on Nanjing Road is also crowded with people talking about the buying and selling of housing leases. Is it that there are no houses? However, people who have no houses to live in also have no gold bars, so they can only sigh at the "house." The Housing Leasing Committee, in order to solve the Shanghai housing shortage, has come up with many methods to make a fairer and more reasonable allocation. However, for one house, there are often more than ten times the number of people applying. Among the applicants, some of them certainly have no houses to live in, but there are also those who already live in very good houses and still come to apply. What are their intentions?</p>
<h3>Sassoon and Hardoon: Two Jews Who Started Their Fortunes in Real Estate</h3>
<p>As the population of Shanghai increases and land prices soar, many merchants engage in the real estate industry. When it comes to real estate, we cannot forget these two major landlords in Shanghai, Sassoon and Hardoon. They were both British Jews who made their fortunes in real estate. They still own a lot of real estate in Shanghai today, although Hardoon has passed away long ago.</p>
<p>The Sassoon House, towering on the Bund of Nanjing Road, is one of the top buildings in Shanghai. This is one of Sassoon's properties. Moreover, the business he runs in Shanghai—E.D. Sassoon &amp; Co., Ltd.—is also located inside. Other properties, such as the Hamilton House on Fuzhou Road, the Cathay Hotel, the Grosvenor House Apartments on Route Doumer, and the Embankment Building on North Suzhou Road, are all Sassoon's properties, and their value is astonishing. Sassoon was born in India. Initially, his father and uncle were merchants in Shanghai, but their scope was very small. During the Great War, the British finances were strained, and the taxes were extraordinarily heavy. Sassoon then transferred a large amount of assets to Shanghai, and became the wealthiest foreigner in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Sassoon had a limp in one leg and often "arrived late." He liked to have fun, and although his gait was difficult, his enthusiasm was undiminished. He is still alone and travels to Bombay, London, Canada, Hong Kong and other places every year because he has assets in various places. When he is in Shanghai, he often stays in the Cathay Hotel of the Sassoon House. His office is also located at the far eastern end of the third floor of the building, decorated in a bizarre and dazzling style. When he overlooks the ships coming and going on the Huangpu River, holding a telephone receiver, observing the changes in the times, and issuing orders, he is indeed very pleased with himself.</p>
<p>Hardoon, an Iraqi Jew, lost both of his parents at a young age. Due to the struggle for survival, he drifted to Shanghai alone and worked as a gatekeeper in Sassoon's house. He was appreciated by Sassoon and transferred to work in the old Sassoon &amp; Sons Co., Ltd. At that time, Sassoon's business was mainly focused on foreign drugs (i.e., opium) and real estate. Hardoon worked inside and studied diligently. During this period, he learned a lot of business experience, which laid the foundation for his future wealth.</p>
<p>Hardoon was blessed by the god of wealth and won the horse racing lottery once and the Guangdong lottery once. Sassoon's trust in him also increased day by day, and he was promoted to assistant manager of the new Sassoon &amp; Sons Co., Ltd. At that time, Hardoon had already become a British citizen and a prominent figure among the British expatriates. In addition to being Sassoon's assistant manager, he also used the funds from the lottery and the convenience of his position to purchase a large amount of property in Shanghai. Almost half of the busiest Nanjing Road was his, but when he bought it, it was still very deserted and the land price was very low. Later, Nanjing Road became a target for investment and construction, and land prices soared, and Hardoon became a mega-rich man at sea.</p>
<p>After Hardoon and his wife, Luo Jialing, passed away one after another, the Aili Garden was left with many adopted children. The huge amount of property left by Hardoon caused a lot of disputes. This famous garden at sea has been shrouded in a smoky atmosphere ever since, and it is no longer as quiet as it used to be.</p>

<h3>Answers to Readers: Legal Questions</h3>
<p>(1) Housing Leasing</p>
<p>Yu Hehao asks: A lessee has leased two houses for as long as sixteen years. The houses have been badly damaged due to several wars. However, the lessee repaired them himself six years ago, but they are now even more dilapidated. The lessor, taking advantage of the prevailing "small rent" trend, intends to rebuild the houses in order to collect huge "small rent." The lessee, however, is unable to afford it. Now, regarding several legal doubts, I hope you can provide answers. (1) Does the lessee have the right to continue leasing after the houses are rebuilt? If the lessor refuses to renew the lease on the pretext of self-use, how can it be resolved legally? (2) Does the law have a similar item for collecting "small rent," and what legal means does the lessee have to prevent the lessor from collecting "small rent" under other pretexts? (3) Recently, there have been reports of measures to collect five or ten years' rent in advance. If the lessor also implements this measure, should the rent be calculated according to the standard multiple announced by the authorities? Or should it be estimated separately? (4) If the lessor does not repair the houses and lets them collapse, is it legally permissible for the lessee to repair the houses at his own expense and still pay rent according to the market price? (5) In addition to the Housing Leasing Management Committee, are there any other judicial organs that handle housing leasing disputes?</p>
<p>[Answer from Lawyer Zhu Yapu] (1) A. If the leasing relationship continues to exist, there is a right to continue leasing. B. It depends on how the lease contract is drawn up to determine. (2) There is no "small rent" item in the law. If the lessor collects "small rent," it violates the law. (3) There are no restrictions on the five- or ten-year rent measures in the law, but the lessor in your area should estimate the amount of rent based on the condition of the building. (4) Yes. (5) The Housing Leasing Management Committee has been resolved to be abolished by the Municipal Council. For housing leasing disputes, in addition to requesting mediation from the district office to which it belongs, you can file a lawsuit in court for adjudication.</p>
<p>(2) Property Division Dispute</p>
<p>Zhou Daren asks: Mr. So-and-so's wife, Ms. So-and-so, gave birth to two daughters, A and B. A is already married, and B is also married. After Mr. So-and-so died, he left behind several houses. Ms. So-and-so dotes on B and wants to divide one of the houses to B. B also said that "her father promised to give B a house when he was dying" (A did not hear Mr. So-and-so say this and fears that it is fabricated). There is no will. Now the house deeds are all in Ms. So-and-so's hands. Please answer the following questions: (1) After a woman is married, does she still have the right to inherit property? (2) If Ms. So-and-so gives the house deed to B privately without A's consent, and A denies that the house belongs to B and sues in court, can she win the case? (3) Does Ms. So-and-so have the authority to dispose of the inheritance?</p>
<p>[Answer from Lawyer Zhu Yapu] (1) Yes. (2) Whether you win or lose depends on the facts and the law. You can file a lawsuit in court for adjudication. (3) Jointly owned property must be disposed of with the consent of all joint owners.</p>
<h3>Why Is There a Water Outage in Beichang'an Lane?</h3>
<p>Because the tap water pipe in our place (Beichang'an Lane, Wusong Road) suddenly cut off the water, and the expenses that should be paid have all been collected as usual. According to the bill collector: There will be a water outage for three days, which will greatly affect life. It has been a day since the water outage. What is the reason for this? It is really incomprehensible, so I hereby write to your newspaper to inquire about it, so that we can know the truth. Sincerely at your service.

<h3>Profits Tax in the 34th Year: The Process of Chamber of Commerce Mediation; The Total Amount of 20 Billion Standards Is Pending Research; No Harassment, No Leakage, The Overall Situation Is Satisfactory</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] The simplified assessment and collection of profits tax for the 34th year has been officially launched in this city. The Municipal Chamber of Commerce, representing various industrial and commercial associations in the city, has negotiated with the tax authorities. It has convened two important associations to report on the progress of the negotiations and explain the coping methods. This has been recorded twice in this newspaper. According to Mr. Pan Shihao, who participated in this matter, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce has more than 200 public association member units. In the past two months, it has declared the capital, turnover, and surplus of each of its members to the association. There are 218 public association units, including more than 27,000 taxpayer units, that have declared. There are also six units of non-public association members who have applied. The total book surplus of all declaration forms is approximately 13 billion. In terms of taxpayer units, although the declarations have not been completed, there should be no major differences in the book surplus of the city's industry and commerce. Because the associations that have not made declarations are all those with simple businesses and weaker organizations, they are actually insignificant. Among the associations that have declared, some members have not yet filled out and submitted the forms. These are all members who have no surplus or are even out of business. The omissions should be limited. In the normal course of events, it is understandable, but according to the law, no matter what, the declaration form must be filled out and submitted. Those who do not have complete accounts may as well estimate and declare. It has been more than two months, but this point has not been implemented, which the person in charge is quite regretful about. The tax authorities, it is said, will severely punish these undeclared units. What the consequences will be is even more worrying.</p>
<p>Budget Limit</p>
<p>According to the precedent in the rear area and the theory of simplified assessment and collection, there must first be a specific total tax revenue budget, and then the actual standard net profit rate of each industry can be used to allocate the tax. The budget of this city must be estimated realistically, and then the allocation can be fair. The Municipal Chamber of Commerce has insisted on this point, and the tax authorities in charge have gradually understood. Recently, after the gentlemen of the Chamber of Commerce met with Director Wang, the budget amount can be reduced to 20 billion. It is said that the original budget set by the Ministry of Finance has also been revised, but it is still far from this amount, so all parties must discuss it carefully. The review committee that will be convened will focus on this as the focus of discussion. In recent days, the Chamber of Commerce and various associations have been discussing this scope. If time permits, it is still necessary to convene various associations that have not been invited to report in person. Based on the reported results of each industry, calculating 13 billion plus 50% is only enough to approach 20 billion.</p>
<p>Affordability</p>
<p>As for whether each industry has this affordability in the current situation, it is still a question to be decided. During the 34th year, this city fell into the hands of the enemy and puppets for about eight months. After the enemy surrendered and the puppet government collapsed, the restoration work was still not rapid. After cleaning up the debris, how many industrial and commercial industries can operate with peace of mind? According to the statements made by various trade associations to the association during the declaration, such as the enemy and puppets forcing purchases, controlling management, cutting off electricity and blocking transportation, and arbitrarily collecting taxes and extorting, all are accounts of blood and tears. With the actual situation like this, the affordability can be seen. Moreover, the puppet currency was finally calculated at 200 to 1. The hidden losses have not yet recovered. The Chamber of Commerce has repeatedly told the authorities about the actual situation, and the responsible officials are also very aware of it. Therefore, Director Wang has repeatedly entrusted the Chamber of Commerce to persuade various unions to support the government's financial difficulties and help more. In the opinion of industry and commerce, industry and commerce should maintain the government, and the government should also understand the difficulties of business and give assistance. The current money supply is so tight, production loans are so difficult to obtain, and the consistent style of the Four Joint Offices and the Big Four Banks has not changed slightly. How to collect this 20 billion tax is quite a problem.</p>
<p>No Harassment Allowed</p>
<p>The purpose of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce in negotiating this matter amidst great difficulties is to avoid harassment in tax collection. According to news revealed by relevant parties, many people advocate "strict investigation." And they said that those who are found to be inconsistent with the actual situation can be punished in various ways. Fortunately, the tax authorities in charge did not allow harassment, and the storm has not yet arrived. The Chamber of Commerce will send the original copies of the declaration forms sent by the various industrial associations to the Direct Tax Bureau in the next few days. The Tax Bureau will calculate the amount of tax separately according to these declaration forms and issue tax payment notices directly to each taxpayer. Taxpayers can pay the tax directly to the national treasury with this, without further investigation of the accounts. The Chamber of Commerce believes that this is an important measure to protect industry and commerce. It has been agreed upon by Mr. Du Yuesheng, Mr. Xu Jiyin, Mr. Luo Qinghua and Director Wang Fuzhou of the Direct Tax Bureau, and there should be no changes. Based on this point, what the taxpayer pays is what the national treasury receives. Officials do not harass, and there is no leakage in the middle, which can be called clear national treasury and both sides are satisfied.</p>
<p>Standard Net Profit</p>
<p>In terms of technology, the Tax Bureau is still studying it seriously. According to the simplified assessment and collection method, there must be a standard net profit rate for each industry as a basis. Then, the amount of tax payable by each household is calculated based on the capital amount or the locked-in amount of goods. According to this method, the amount actually paid by each household will be different from the amount reported by each household. In other words, each industry should have a standard net profit rate. Within the same industry, each household shall pay tax uniformly according to this standard, based on its sales amount or capital amount. The Chamber of Commerce has compiled some information based on the declaration forms filled out and submitted by each industry and each household. However, it is planned to abandon it in the future and calculate the tax according to the amount of surplus filled out by each household. Because in the 34th year, there were puppet currency, legal currency, old capital, new capital, pre-adjustment, post-adjustment and other relationships, it is not appropriate to use the usual method to find out the sales standard, net profit rate and capital standard net profit rate.</p>
<p>Mission Will Be Completed</p>
<p>The establishment of the Tax Affairs Special Committee of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce is purely to resolve the disputes over the profits tax for the 34th year. Five people are mutually recommended from the Board of Directors to take on the task and handle everything in accordance with the policy of the elders at any time. Now that the tax affairs are coming to an end, it is said that this committee will be dissolved. Unfinished matters will be handled directly by the Board of Directors. The chairman of the committee, Mr. Luo Qinghua, is in Beijing on official business. It will be decided after Gu Shen.</p>
<h3>The Second Phase of Rayon Allocation Today; Knitting Factories Can Apply for Registration</h3>
<p>The Central Trust Bureau, acting as the Government Materials and Property Committee, after allocating rayon last Thursday, the market price has fallen sharply, and the panic of shortages in the market has been resolved. Various silk weaving factories can now produce fully. The Bureau has stipulated an allocation of 1,000 cases this month. In addition to those allocated last week, there are still more than 300 cases remaining, which can be applied for by various silk weaving factories. Therefore, the Bureau has scheduled the second phase of rayon allocation today. All registered factories can apply, pay the money tomorrow, and ship the goods the day after tomorrow. The allocation price will be determined by the small group meeting this morning. In the future, the Bureau will allocate once every Monday and Thursday. The Central Trust Bureau is now processing registration procedures for rayon allocation to knitting factories.</p>
<h3>The Cloth Price Review Committee Is Scheduled to Meet on Thursday</h3>
<p>The Social Bureau has approved the convening of the second "Cotton Cloth Price Review Committee" at the Bureau's conference room on the afternoon of the 24th of this month. In addition to informing the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Machine Knitting Workers' Union, the Machine Textile Industry Association, the Cotton Cloth Merchants' Association, and the China Textile Corporation, etc., to send full-time members to participate in this meeting, the Municipal Government and the Municipal Council will also send people to participate at that time.</p>
<h3>The Financial Industry Is Uniquely Prosperous; New Listings Are Emerging One After Another</h3>
<p>Although the city's industrial and commercial industries have not yet embarked on the road to prosperity, financial institutions have been increasing from time to time. From the 3rd of this month to the end of last week, on the banking side, there are Liangzhe Commercial Bank and Changsha Hongxing, etc. On the money shop side, there are Jincheng, Lichang, Hengfeng, and Tongde, etc. The Yuanyuan Chang Bank opened today. The address is 473 Jiangxi Middle Road. The manager is Yu Dakun. The head office is located at 42 Zhongzheng Road, Nanchang. It is reported that there are still Guongan Trust Company and Guangxin Silver Company on Wednesday and Kunming Yihua Bank, Shanghai Branch on Friday that will continue to be listed this week. Therefore, the number of exchange numbers in the clearing house will increase from 187 to 196 this month.</p>
<h3>More Than 400,000 Spindles in the Northeast; Half Have Been Destroyed, Most of the Machinery Has Been Moved or Burned</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] According to reliable investigation: There are a total of 19 enemy-owned textile factories of various sizes in the Northeast. There are approximately 400,000 spindles. At present, only half of them are actually usable. Most factories have been repeatedly attacked by soldiers. The machinery and equipment that have not been moved have been burned down. It is now known that Shenyang has Fengtian Textile Factory (50,815 spindles, 10,888 thread spindles, 2,000 looms), Toyo Yarn Factory (5,000 spindles), Gongtai Yarn Factory (50,400 spindles), Yamamoto Cotton Cloth Factory, Dehe Cloth Factory, Hehe Dyeing Factory, Manmeng Wool Weaving Factory, Fengtian Manufacturing Factory, and Nisshin Amami Factory, etc. There are 9 factories in total. Dalian has the Daiwa Yarn Factory. There is one factory in Quanzhou: Neiwaimian Yarn Factory (107,552 spindles, 18,752 thread spindles). There is one factory in Wafangdian: Manzhou Neiwaimian Yarn Factory. There are two factories in Liaoyang: Manzhou Textile Factory (78,700 spindles, 2,808 thread spindles, 1,045 looms), Manzhou Manufacturing Factory, etc. There is one factory in Jilin: Toyo Seima Factory. There is one factory in Harbin: Kangde Wool Factory. There are two factories in Jinzhou: Chemian Textile Factory (52,400 spindles, 2,340 looms), Manzhou Fu Textile Factory (49,520 spindles, 960 looms), etc. There is one factory in Yingkou: Yingkou Yarn Factory (55,728 spindles, 1,730 looms).</p>
<h3>The Tobacco Industry's Loan Has Not Been Approved, China Farmers First Handle Exchange Settlement</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Cigarette Industry Association has applied to the Central Government for an industrial loan of 15 billion yuan because the industry has been greatly affected by foreign goods. However, it has not yet been approved. It is now known that the China Farmers Bank has allowed the bank to handle the exchange settlement for tobacco leaf transportation and sales. For tobacco leaves transported from Qihan, Hankou, Guangzhou and other places to Shanghai, exchange settlement can be handled with the shipping note of each shipping company. The amount is 60% of the total value of the tobacco leaves, for a period of 15 days, with a monthly interest rate of 5%. It is reported that there have been many applications in recent days.</p>
<h3>There Are Not Enough Improved Silkworm Eggs; China Silkworm Is Actively Preparing</h3>
<p>Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces were originally silkworm silk production areas in my country. Before the war, the silkworm egg production in Jiangsu Province for spring use was 1.2 to 1.3 million sheets of improved varieties and about 150,000 sheets of native varieties. The autumn use improved varieties was 700,000 to 800,000 sheets. The spring use improved varieties in Zhejiang Province was 1.1 to 1.4 million sheets and about 1.5 million sheets of native varieties. The autumn use improved varieties was 1.2 million sheets. During the Anti-Japanese War, after being destroyed by the enemy and puppets, the production volume this year has dropped to 650,000 sheets in Jiangsu Province and only 50,000 sheets in Zhejiang Province. Together with 300,000 sheets imported from Japan, the total is only 1 million sheets. In order to develop silkworm silk production next year, China Silkworm will start by increasing the number of silkworm eggs. In addition to producing 250,000 sheets of new products in advance at Kunming, Caoba, and Yunnan Silkworm Industry New Life Company, which have been transported from Kunming to Shanghai for cold storage on the 18th for backup, another 750,000 sheets have been produced in various seed production fields in Jiangsu Province and 150,000 sheets in Zhejiang Province. These total 1.15 million sheets are prepared for distribution to silkworm farmers in various places during the silkworm breeding season next year. However, according to estimates by people in the industry, the demand for improved silkworm eggs for spring next year is 450,000 to 500,000 sheets in Jiangsu Province and 50,000 sheets of native varieties. The demand in Zhejiang Province is 500,000 sheets and 500,000 sheets of native varieties. If the improved varieties are used to replace the native varieties, the original quantity will still be insufficient. The authorities of China Silkworm still hope to work hard on this in order to ensure that the improved varieties are fully used in the silkworm eggs next spring, and the raw silk harvest can be increased and the quality can be improved.</p>
<h3>Textile Manufacturers Discuss Flat Prices; The Government Implements Supervision and Strictly Prohibits Stockpiling; Manufacturers Refer to Market Prices and Sell in Large Quantities</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] The directors of the Cotton Textile Industry Association in the six districts of the city held an informal meeting yesterday afternoon. According to a director who participated in the meeting: Their common opinion will be submitted to the Textile Management Committee when it meets today, and they do not intend to make a written request separately. His personal view on this issue is that the government should stand in the position of supervision and strictly prohibit yarn factories from stockpiling; at the same time, yarn factories should refer to market prices and supply the market in large quantities. In this way, the surge in yarn and cloth prices can be effectively curbed; even if the general prices continue to rise, the rise in yarn and cloth prices must be moderate and reasonable. It is still remembered that after the exchange rate adjustment in mid-August, prices fluctuated sharply. At this time, each factory sold 30,000 bales of yarn at a price slightly lower than the market price, and as a result, the yarn price stabilized. This is enough to prove it.</p>
<h3>Taiwanese Rice Is Shipped to Shanghai Continuously; There Is No Shortage of Food in This City</h3>
<p>Since the authorities have actively dredged the source of food supply in this city, the supply is not lacking and the future is very optimistic. According to the food authorities, the food panic in this city was the most serious in summer. Later, President Zhu of the Executive Yuan sent personnel to Taiwan to negotiate the shipment of a large amount of Taiwanese rice to Shanghai. A huge amount of rice was also shipped to Shanghai from domestic Sichuan and Jiangxi provinces, Vietnam, Siam and other places, and unrestricted supply began. Since the authorities adopted this policy, the rice market has stabilized. The Taiwan province harvests three crops a year and produces a lot of rice. The state-owned China Merchants Group is assigning special ships to ship rice to Shanghai, so the citizens of this city can now be assured of food in the future. Mayor Wu has now strictly ordered that the price of medium-grade rice must not exceed 46,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Kunming Resumes the Gold Market; The Old Taels Will Be Abolished from Next Month</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Kunming, 20th] The Kunming Gold Industry Association, in order to avoid disturbances, had resolved to suspend the association's transactions for two weeks, from the 7th to the 19th. It has now decided to resume transactions from the 21st, only doing the morning session, and decided to abolish the old taels from November 1st and use new scales in order to unify with other countries in the league.</p>
<h3>Customs Task Force Established to Strengthen Anti-Smuggling Efforts</h3>
<p>Considering the rampant smuggling activities currently, the customs authorities have decided to strengthen the powers of the Customs Anti-Smuggling Division and will establish several anti-smuggling squads. These squads will maintain close liaison with the Guard Inspection Group to achieve twice the result with half the effort in anti-smuggling operations. Furthermore, large anti-smuggling vessels ordered from the United States by the Ministry of Finance are expected to arrive in Shanghai from the US soon and will be allocated for customs use. Therefore, it is believed that the trend of smuggling can be gradually eliminated in the future.</p>
<h3>Woolen Textile Factories Request the Executive Headquarters to Handle Wool Raw Materials</h3>
<p>Woolen textile factories in this city are facing a shortage of wool arrivals and are unable to increase production due to Australian restrictions on the export of wool tops. It is reported that the industry has requested the Executive Headquarters to find ways to handle raw materials on their behalf.</p>
<h3>Only 3 Million Dan of Domestic Cotton Available for Factories; Most Used for Household Handicrafts; Our Five-Year Plan Lags Behind India</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Economic authorities have a clear plan for the development of China's cotton textile industry. They hope that in five years, China will have seven million spindles, with each person consuming fifteen meters of cloth per year. India also has a five-year textile plan, with the goal of each person consuming thirty yards of cloth per year after five years. In comparison, China is still lagging behind. Sources told reporters that approximately 2.5 million spindles are currently in operation in China's cotton textile industry, with about 1.5 million spindles damaged and awaiting repair or awaiting operation due to insufficient electricity. In the past, British experts strongly advised China to focus on repairing old machines to save financial resources, which was truly insightful. In terms of raw materials, this year's domestic cotton harvest is 6 million dan, half of which will be consumed by handicrafts and other household uses. Therefore, only 3 million dan of domestic cotton will actually be available next year, and efforts are still needed to solve the transportation problem. The remaining shortfall will need to be supplemented by American cotton. The quality of Shaanxi cotton was excellent before the war, capable of spinning up to 42-count yarn, but due to lack of improvement during the war, the quality has deteriorated, which is worthy of our attention.</p>
<h3>Sales of Chinese Silk to the UK Are Under Negotiation</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] According to sources, the United Kingdom may become one of China's silk markets in the future. Chinese and British business circles have recently been in contact about this. The prices offered by the UK are even higher than those offered by the US, but the quantities needed are smaller. Silk industry insiders say that about 30% of the current selling price of Chinese silk is interest from high-interest loans. If low-interest loans from the state were available, costs would be greatly reduced, and competitiveness in the international market would be relatively improved. In terms of quality, Chinese silk is still inferior to Japanese silk, which urgently needs improvement.</p>
<h3>Enemy and Puppet Property Handling Bureau to Close Within the Year</h3>
<p>The Enemy and Puppet Property Handling Bureau in the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui region has remitted 233 billion yuan to the national treasury to date, including about 90 billion yuan used to offset the price of cotton cloth for the Ministry of Military and Political Affairs. The bureau plans to close down within this year, and all items to be sold will be processed by the end of the month.</p>
<h3>Bayer Pharmaceutical Factory to be Transferred to Private Management</h3>
<p>Recently, general Western medicines on the market have suffered significant losses due to the influx of American goods. However, the sales of Western medicines produced by the German-owned Bayer Pharmaceutical Factory, which we have taken over, remain strong. According to Li Juren, director of the Bayer Factory Liquidation Office of the Enemy and Puppet Property Handling Bureau, this is because Bayer has a very good reputation. Now, because the factory's closure is approaching and raw materials are limited, the Western medicines it produces are still very popular. Furthermore, half of the factory's liquidation work has been completed, and it is expected to be completed by next spring. It is reported that the government, not wanting to compete with the people for profit, will tender the Bayer Pharmaceutical Factory for private operation.</p>
<h3>New Cigarette Tax Implemented; Manufacturers Plan to Appeal Again</h3>
<p>Cigarette manufacturers in this city are facing increased burdens due to the implementation of the new cigarette tax rates. The Cigarette Industry Association and responsible persons from various factories are scheduled to visit the Goods Tax Bureau of the Ministry of Finance this morning at 10:00 AM to inquire with Director Fang Dong about the central government's response to the various requests made by the cigarette industry in its previous petition and what relief measures will be taken. If the authorities still do not provide a concrete response, it is expected that the various Chinese cigarette merchants will face significant difficulties in the future.</p>
<h3>Metal Prices Increase</h3>
<p>Recently, the ordering prices of copper, iron, and other metals from abroad have generally increased, leading to an increase in the prices of copper, brass, bronze, wrought iron products, and some hardware items in this city. However, due to the lack of improvement in actual sales of these goods, the price increase is still slight.</p>
<h3>US Cotton Exchange Suspends Trading; Clearing of Huge Transactions from the Last Three Days; Some Accuse Short Sellers of Manipulating the Market</h3>
<p>[Reuters, New York, 19th] The New York, New Orleans, and Chicago cotton exchanges have all suspended trading today. According to the New York Cotton Exchange authorities, this decision was made to protect the interests of the public and the cotton exchange. Industry insiders believe that this move is intended to give brokers an opportunity to clear the huge volume of transactions from the last three days. Exchange staff were still busy this morning verifying the transactions concluded on Friday, a procedure that is usually completed by 4 or 5 PM on the same day.</p>
<p>[Reuters, New Orleans, 19th] Regarding the suspension of trading today, the Cotton Exchange issued the following statement: The board of directors of the New Orleans Cotton Exchange, in view of the chaotic situation in the cotton market in the past few days, unanimously decided to temporarily suspend trading on the exchange in order to clear the transactions and accounts from the past week. This measure will be of great benefit to the cotton industry in general. Rumors that some individuals have insufficient funds are exaggerated. All transactions have sufficient margin, and there are no bounced checks. The situation is expected to clear up by the end of this week, and the exchange is scheduled to resume trading on October 21st.</p>
<p>[Reuters, New York, 19th] The suspension of trading announced by the New York Cotton Exchange today does not seem to have caused concern among industry insiders. According to general observation, the purpose of this move is to clear the huge volume of transactions that have been concluded since Wednesday. The total number of forward cotton contracts traded in the past three days amounted to 1,748,000 bales, which is rare in recent years. However, some people are slandering the cotton exchange's suspension of trading, saying that "short sellers are suspected of manipulation." Senator Thomas said that cotton brokers and exchanges intentionally lowered market prices and demanded that federal authorities supervise the commodity market. Because other commodity prices and the cotton textile industry are in very good condition, why is cotton suddenly being hit?</p>

<h3>Monthly Rubber Demand is 2,000 Tons; No Fear of Foreign Competition Currently; High Interest Rates and High Wages Hinder Development</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] After the victory of the Pacific War, the supply of world rubber was thoroughly controlled by the United Rubber Committee, organized by the United Kingdom, the United States, France, and the Netherlands. Up to now, China's rubber sources have all come from transshipment through Hong Kong and have not been directly supplied by the United Committee. The Rubber Industry Association of this city has made requests to the Ministry of Economic Affairs regarding this matter. It is now known that the ministry has entrusted the association to investigate the rubber needs of Chongqing, Tianjin, Shenyang, and Guangzhou in order to forward them to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for direct negotiations with Washington. The three cities of Chongqing, Tianjin, and Shenyang have now replied to Shanghai, estimating the monthly demand to be over 2,000 tons. According to Mr. Hong Nianzu, chairman of the Rubber Industry Association of this city, there are over 50 rubber factories in this city, with over 40 joining the association; there are over 500 transport and sales firms of all sizes, with over 200 joining the association. The current prosperity of the rubber industry is temporary in nature because: (1) During the war, the people lacked goods due to Japanese control and urgently need to replenish them. The demand is also very large due to low prices. (2) Supply is insufficient. The current production volume is only half of what it was before the war. This is due to the loss of equipment during the war, current electricity restrictions, and the low efficiency of general workers. (3) Foreign goods have not arrived. Taking tires as an example, the United States used a large number of artificial tires during the war, which were of very poor quality. Currently, the natural rubber tires produced are first used domestically and there is no time for export. Foreign goods will not arrive in large quantities until the summer of next year. These factors are also sufficient to create prosperity for China's rubber industry. Looking ahead to the future of China's rubber industry, in order to achieve long-term development, in addition to political stability and transportation recovery, it is necessary to eliminate high-interest loans and strive to reduce costs through the stabilization of wages.</p>
<h3>The Current Status of Shanghai's Soap Manufacturing Industry</h3>
<p>— Zhang Bo'an</p>
<p>Soap is a daily necessity and also a part of the oil and fat industry. It can be said that there are only two large-scale manufacturing factories in our country, one operated by foreigners and the other first operated by foreigners and then taken over by Chinese. The rest are either medium-sized manufacturing or small-scale manufacturing.</p>
<p>Huang Xiangmao and Gu Ben soaps are now sold in almost every corner of the country. Their success is due to one secret: decades of consistency, not just luck.</p>
<p>Since the victory, Xiangmao soap has not been manufactured to this day. It is said that British merchants, in view of the surging labor unrest in our country and the fact that the British economy has not yet recovered, the future of "Xiangmao" is still uncertain.</p>
<p>"Gu Ben", however, has never stopped manufacturing until now, but compared to before, there is a sense of the past. "Gu Ben" has two soap factories in Shanghai, one is the Xiaoshadu Road factory that is currently manufacturing every day, and the other is the Xujiahui factory. The scale of the latter can be said to be second to none in China. The Xiaoshadu Road factory has never stopped working. The Xujiahui factory was once managed by the enemy and has now been completely returned. The former's daily output is 600 to 700 boxes; the latter is more than double the former. When the two factories start working at the same time, the monthly soap production is about 50,000 to 60,000 boxes.</p>
<p>It is said that after the victory, foreigners came to inspect these two factories—Xiangmao and Gu Ben; Xiangmao's equipment is 15 years behind American factories, and Gu Ben is 25 years behind! But it is still unparalleled in China! Currently, the "Gu Ben" factory's daily output is 600 boxes, with only the Xiaoshadu Road factory manufacturing. It is heard that the Xujiahui factory will be able to resume work soon, but because domestic transportation is difficult and raw materials are scarce for transportation, it is questionable whether it can purchase such a large amount of oil and fat.</p>
<p>In the soap manufacturing industry, glycerin is the only valuable by-product. Xiangmao and Gu Ben both collect glycerin. The presence of glycerin in soap not only loses valuable by-products, but also lowers the quality of the soap.</p>
<p>Next, we want to talk about medium-sized soap factories. Medium-sized soap factories, such as Nanyang Soap Factory, are also a well-known brand with nearly 40 years of history, because it has achieved great success in strict production. The factory suffered severe wartime losses, but it was restored soon due to "man-made" efforts! However, the current output is only two-thirds of the current output of Wuzhou Gu Ben. Its "Nanyang Super Grade" is directly equal to Wuzhou Gu Ben, sister soap. At the same time, it produces a blue barrel soap, which is suitable for the washing and dyeing industry. Most of Shanghai's washing and dyeing industry uses its blue barrel soap. The factory's business is currently actively advancing, and it has recently been heard that it has ordered new-style soap-making machines from abroad, and production will be expanded as much as possible. Generally speaking, this brand may jump up wildly in a few years.</p>
<p>Such as Guanghua Soap, is also a medium-sized production, but Guanghua Soap has a very short history, but it is "catching up later", which is undeniable. The promotion methods of this Guanghua Soap can be said to be meticulous.</p>
<p>As for small soap factories, there are countless in Shanghai, and the competition is also very fierce, but most of them are due to weak capital. Under the dominance of large and medium-sized counterparts, operators are very careful.</p>
<p>Soap manufacturing industry, because it is the first daily necessity, and the second possibility of foreign goods competition is very small, so its future is relatively bright. But we hope that major factories can make their own alkali and their own soap, which is in line with the complete national goods.</p>

<h3>Prominent Scholars Gather in the Capital; the Academia Sinica Council Meeting Solemnly Opened Yesterday Morning; Council Chairman Zhu Jiahua Presided Over the Opening Ceremony</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 20th] The long-anticipated third meeting of the second council of the Academia Sinica finally opened solemnly at the Academia Sinica here at 9:30 AM on the 20th. Attending the meeting were Council Chairman Zhu Jiahua, Secretary Weng Wenhao, Director-General Sa Bendong, Councilors Hu Shi, Fu Sinian, Chen Yuan, Lin Kesheng, Li Shuhua, Wang Shijie, Cai Yi-sheng, Bing Zhi, Zhou Gengsheng, and others, approximately 30 people. Party and government leaders who attended included Yu Youren, Zhou Zhongyue, Wu Dingchang, Bai Chongxi, Jiang Menglin, Chen Lifu, Hong Lanyou, and others. Council Chairman Zhu Jiahua served as chairman. After performing the ceremonial rites, the chairman delivered the opening speech, briefly describing the difficulties encountered by our scientific community during the Anti-Japanese War, and the efforts that should be made in the future to adapt to the requirements of the times. He encouraged colleagues to adopt practical methods, make major decisions, and seek the true and universal development of science, and determined that when the Supreme National Defense Council held its meeting, it decided that scientific research should account for a certain percentage of the entire national budget, so that research work could enter a new stage. Then, Secretary-General Wu Dingchang read the chairman's exhortation, earnestly instructing that without science, there would be no national defense, and encouraging efforts to explore in order to catch up. After reading, President Yu Youren delivered a speech, expressing his great comfort to the academic researchers who, during the Anti-Japanese War, continued their research tirelessly in the difficult environment of repeated relocations, in a spirit similar to that of the ancient sages who "did not change their joy even in adversity". He also said that the difficult period had now passed, and the establishment of a new China based on the Three Principles of the People still awaited the efforts of scientists across the country. The government would not only return politics to the people, but also determined to "return science to the scientists", hoping to complete this arduous task and jointly build a new China and a new world. Then, Vice President Zhou Zhongyue was invited to deliver a speech, briefly stating that the present is the atomic age, and if we want to create a new world culture, research tools must be complete and funding must be increased so that we can engage in specialized research to increase human well-being and maintain world peace. After the speech, Minister of National Defense Bai Chongxi was invited to speak. Mr. Bai first quoted Chairman Chiang's words, saying that without science, there would be no national defense, and that modern national defense needed science extremely at the present stage in order to seek self-defense and maintain world peace. The era of meat bombs and broadswords in the past has passed, and we should prepare as soon as possible to catch up. He hoped that scientists could cooperate with the Ministry of National Defense. Mr. Bai also announced that the authorities had decided to use 2% of the Ministry of National Defense's budget for scientific research. After Mr. Bai's speech, Secretary-General Wu spoke on behalf of Hong Lanyou, and Minister of Organization Chen Lifu spoke successively. Mr. Chen believed that the current research work only had an upper layer and no lower layer, which was a defect. He hoped that it could be popularized in the future, and that every school and every factory could have research institutes. If the lower layer is sound, the upper layer will inevitably be sound. He hoped that there would be no reluctance to spend money on scientific research, that external liaison should be strengthened, and that attention should be paid to cultivating talents and not pouring cold water on young people. Finally, Hu Shi delivered a reply on behalf of the councilors. Mr. Hu loudly appealed and spoke passionately, saying that if the government could give us ten years of stability, and if the government and society could give us sufficient financial resources, then our colleagues would be able to achieve something within ten years, at least to establish a PhD research institute. The opening ceremony was completed amidst warm applause at around 12:00 noon. Afterwards, a group photo was taken for commemoration. According to Director-General Sa Bendong, in addition to the doctoral degree awarding case, the issue of how to strengthen the organization of the council will also be discussed at this conference. To date, the council has received approximately 20 proposals.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 20th] The third meeting of the second council of the Academia Sinica is scheduled to hold its first general assembly on the morning of the 21st.

<h3>Ministry of Education Invites Dr. Pei Fei to Hold a Meeting to Review International Courses</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 20th] The Ministry of Education invited Dr. Pei Fei, an expert in international courses, to hold a meeting at the Ministry of Education yesterday morning at 9:00 AM. Attending the meeting were Director Zhou Hongjing of the Ministry of Education and more than ten experts from various universities in economics, politics, law, history, geography, and other subjects related to international courses. Dr. Pei Fei reported: "Regarding international courses, Columbia University in the United States once led more than ten Chinese students to specialize in research. This research is related to economics, history, and society, so research takes these three aspects as the research center. During the Anti-Japanese War, China was affected by the situation, and the level of Chinese students declined, which should be improved in the future. The United States also has entrance exams for foreign students. The level of students' international cultural exchange should be improved." Director Zhou reported on the curriculum settings for the first, second, and third grades of Chinese universities. Courses related to international courses are all designated as required courses, and elective courses are only available after the third grade. Dr. Pei Fei expressed satisfaction and hoped that foreign students would not all go to the United States and could also go to Europe. Director Zhou explained that six of the people present today were students who had studied in the UK. It is heard that Dr. Pei Fei is scheduled to go to Beiping on the 21st, stay in Beiping for about three weeks, and then go to Wuhan.</p>

<h3>The Crowd Sound Team Triumphs This Morning; Defeated Huasheng Again Last Night, Hasty End to the Game, Numerous Fouls, Greatly Reduced Excitement</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] The Crowd Sound Basketball Team is scheduled to return to the Philippines by plane at 5:30 this morning. Although Wu Shaoshu, Vice President of the Sports Association, tried his best to persuade them to stay, the players have been in Shanghai for more than a month and are eager to return home. The team originally agreed to have a performance match with the Conquest team after finishing the game with Huasheng last night, but unfortunately this did not happen. The team exchanged photos and pennants with the Conquest team as a memento.</p>
<p>Great Disappointment</p>
<p>Last night's game against Huasheng saw the Crowd Sound team win again, with a final score of 42 to 28. In the first half, Crowd Sound took the lead with 28 to 14 points. The Municipal Gymnasium was packed, but unfortunately last night, due to an excessive desire to win, the Huasheng side committed numerous fouls, resulting in a complete lack of excitement. In the second half, Huasheng was left with only three players due to fouls, unable to substitute, and the game ended hastily, leaving the audience greatly disappointed. The total number of fouls committed by both sides reached as many as 53 times.</p>
<p>Free Throw Scores</p>
<p>The Crowd Sound team still fielded their five tigers, the Chen brothers, Cai, and Yang. Huasheng responded with Fu Jinsheng, Wang Youcai, Wang Hongbin, Liu Xueqi, and Wang Kanruo. The referees were Qu Honglu, Zheng Zhifang, and Wang Hongbin. Wang Hongbin committed the first foul, Yang Renhui missed the free throw, Wang Kanruo violated the rules again, and Cai Wenzhang scored one point, opening the scoring. The Jin brothers, Jin Zhi and Jin De, scored every time they shot, leading 10 to 1. At that time, referee Qu Honglu's glasses were broken by the ball, and Liu Hesheng substituted him to continue the game. The first quarter ended 18 to 5. In the next exchange, Guo Jinming replaced Liu Xueqi, and Jin De added to the score, making it 21 to 5. Wang Youcai made a long shot, opening the scoring record for the Shanghai team. Wang Hongbin was fouled out five times, and Liu Xueqi re-entered the game, but it did not help the situation. Crowd Sound was like entering an unmanned territory, while Huasheng committed more and more fouls. Xueqi was also fouled out, and the score was 28 to 14, completing the second quarter.</p>
<p>Three Players in the Game</p>
<p>In the second half, the battle resumed, with the score at 32 to 14. Wang Kanruo was fouled out again, and Yin Huanwen replaced him, but the situation remained one-sided. The score in the third quarter was 37 to 1. In the final quarter, the number of fouls increased even further. Ultimately, Huasheng had only three players left to play. At this time, Crowd Sound also had no intention of fighting, and simply passed the ball to each other to finish the game. The final score was 42 to 28.</p>

<h3>Farewell Commemorative Performance Match: Italian Overseas Chinese Lost to the Mixed Team, Unfamiliar Skills Result in a Score of 3-0</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] Yesterday was a clear autumn day. The Italian Overseas Chinese Football Team played a farewell match in Shanghai against the Chinese Mixed Team. Football fans flocked to the scene, with a total of no less than four to five thousand people in attendance. The Mixed Army's composition was based on the principle of selecting those who were recently familiar with football matters. Therefore, the selection target was based on the results of the Small Ball League as a sample. However, yesterday, Yan Shixin, Fei Chunhua, Han Longhai, and Li Yao were mistakenly absent. Fortunately, the new forces arrived completely, and Gu Yiche, Zhao Yongfang, Wu Kaimin, and Lei Shuping were replaced. As a result of the match, the Mixed Army still won by a large margin of 3 to 0, with the first half ending 1 to 0.</p>
<p>Willing but Unable</p>
<p>The Italian Overseas Chinese were willing but unable, and the players generally had a pale complexion, indicating insufficient nutrition recently. Although the forwards of the Mixed Team were gathered from various teams, the three young players, Gu Yiche, Lei Shuping, and Gao Xiuqing, all showed normal conditions. In particular, Gu Yiche's performance was the most brilliant. Although it was not immediately clear how hard Jia Youliang worked on the right wing, the first and second goals scored were both created by Youliang's passes, making his contribution undeniable. The defense was led by Meng Yiliang, Qu Yongfu, and Zhang Gen, who were very organized.</p>
<p>One Goal Ahead</p>
<p>The match was delayed until 3:10 PM due to the late arrival of the Mixed Team members. The referee was Wu Shouheng. As the battle unfolded, both sides showed unfamiliarity, with very little brilliance. Until 25 minutes into the game, Gao Xiuqing received a pass from Meng Yiliang and passed it to Jia Youliang. Youliang skillfully delivered it to an opening, Luo Xulai blocked the air, Lei Shuping darted in and blocked it, and McNeady was unable to save it. The first half ended with the Mixed Team leading 1 to 0.</p>
<p>Three Goals in a Row</p>
<p>After the break, the competition resumed. The Italian Overseas Chinese were determined to counterattack, but unfortunately, they did not succeed. After four minutes, the Mixed Team suddenly became active. Lei Shuping grabbed the ball and passed it to Youliang. Youliang dribbled one step forward, and the five forwards advanced. Jia passed it to the right with one foot, Lei deliberately created an opening, and Gao Xiuqing arrived with the ball, scoring a clear and beautiful goal. After the goal, although the Italian Overseas Chinese frequently counterattacked, the Mixed Team tried their best to defend and did not succeed. In the 34th minute, Wu Kaimin broke through the empty goal in the crowd again. Not a minute later, the whistle sounded long, and the Mixed Team defeated the Italian Overseas Chinese by a score of 3 to 0.

<p>Civil Affairs Briefing</p>
<h3>Correction of Errors in the New Household Registration Law: Ministry of the Interior Telegraphed to Various Agencies for Verification</h3>
<p>The revised Household Registration Law and its Implementing Regulations have long been promulgated and implemented. It is now heard that the Ministry of the Interior has discovered errors in the above two laws: (1) Article 8 of the Household Registration Law Implementing Regulations, the word "book" in the phrase "Registration Book for Mobile Population" is a mistake for the word "register". (2) Article 20 of the revised Household Registration Law, the phrase "birth and discovery of abandoned children" and Article 20, Paragraph 4 of the Household Registration Law Implementing Regulations, the word "self" in the phrase "adopted children and their own parents" are both mistakes for the word "birth". (3) Article 21, Paragraph 2 of the Household Registration Law Implementing Regulations, the word "book" in the phrase "registration book involving more than two types of the same event" is a mistake for the word "person". The Ministry of the Interior has also stated that when various places handle national identity cards in accordance with the provisions of Article 11 of the Household Registration Law, the word "part" in "identity card" is often mistakenly written as "copy", which is obviously inconsistent with the provisions of that article and should be corrected uniformly to avoid discrepancies, and telegraphed for verification and correction.</p>
<h3>Representatives of Public Opinion Organs Holding Positions in Enterprise Organs: Permitted to Receive Wages During Meetings</h3>
<p>Regarding whether representatives of public opinion organs at all levels, who are legally allowed to hold positions in public and private enterprise organs, can receive wages during their attendance at meetings, it is heard that the Municipal Government previously telegraphed to the Ministry of the Interior for verification. It is now known that the Ministry of the Interior has approved the telegraphic reply, which should be regarded as public leave and still allowed to pay wages.</p>

<h3>The Young Detachment is Strong: The Melody of the Jining Campaign</h3>
<p>—A Fengzhen Air Report on the 5th, Special Correspondent Liu Yingyuan of this Newspaper</p>
<p>The [Young] Detachment suffered some losses due to the capture of Zhuozi Mountain, so it was originally planned to serve as a reserve force for the attack on Jining this time. On the morning of the 10th, when the city was suddenly attacked, the "Yellow River" Detachment once entered Qiaoxi. Because the follow-up troops did not follow, it suffered a setback and withdrew to the north of Luotuozi to confront the Communists. At this time, the only National Army force outside Jining was a "Young" Detachment, covering the attacking troops in the southwestern suburbs of Jining. At 1:00 PM on the same day, the Communist Army's field force reinforced from the south launched a fierce attack on the "Young" Detachment. What was discovered during the day was the Independent Brigade, and after dark, the 358th Brigade also joined the battle. After seven rounds of tug-of-war, the Communists never broke through the "Young" Detachment's position.</p>
<p>On the morning of the 11th, the Communist Army's outer forces all reached the rear of the National Army's attacking forces. During the day, in addition to consolidating Wolong and Tiejun Mountains, our side also divided two branches to counterattack outwards. The "Young" Detachment detoured to the south from the left wing, approaching the mountains near Suji Station and occupying Madeqingdi. The "Yellow River" Detachment rushed north from the right wing towards Baishitou. The Communist Army did not carry out a fierce resistance that day, but instead directed the outer forces straight to the west, circling around and crossing the railway line, spreading to the banks of the Bawang River, forming a larger encirclement. Before sunset, our counterattacking forces did not dare to continue to penetrate deeply, and immediately ordered the troops to withdraw and build fortifications in the original position belonging to Huangjialiang. Waiting for the Communist Army's fierce attack to preserve the already consolidated position of the "Victory" Detachment on Tiejun and Wolong Mountains.</p>
<p>After dark, the Communist Army's outer forces completely returned, and then used the main force to attack the Huangjialiang position of our "Young" Detachment. They broke through Houjia Village, reached Luotuozi, and bombarded the "Young" Detachment command post in Bianjia Village. The "Lijin" Column's command post was also affected and subsequently moved to Tiejun Mountain, joining the "Victory" Detachment. At this time, the "Yellow River" Detachment was confronting the Communist Army on the right wing. The Liang and Zhang Battalions of the "Young" Detachment were subjected to a wave-like encirclement by more than five brigades of the Communist Army. Although the Communist Army launched eight fierce attacks with a company as the unit, the "Young" Detachment never gave up Huangjialiang and continued to support it until dawn on the 12th.</p>
<p>The Night of Critical Situation</p>
<p>On the night of the 10th, the situation of the National Army was the most dangerous. The troops attacking the city did not enter the city, and the covering reserve forces were heavily surrounded by the Communist Army. The reinforcing "Tangsheng" Column was still in the Liangcheng area, more than 200 miles away from Jining. After the Communist Army broke through the Houjia Village defense line and reached Luotuozi, the directly subordinate small capital team of the "Lijin" Column became chaotic, and the defeated soldiers even affected the position of the "Yellow River" Detachment. Some even retreated to the Dichengzi area. When the "Young" Detachment command post was attacked, the Chief of Staff and Adjutant were seriously injured. The Detachment Commander commanded a small unit, holding two battalions and resisting the Communist Army. At the same time, contact was lost with the "Lijin" Headquarters, causing the highest commander of the "Lijin" Column to enter the position of the "Victory" Detachment on Tiejun Mountain, less than three miles away from Jining City.</p>
<p>On this night, the Communist Army in Jining City counterattacked Wolong and Tiejun Mountains, and several times rushed to the vicinity of the bunkers, all of which were suppressed by our heavy firepower. At that time, in Huangjialiang, the "Young" Detachment had less than 600 people capable of fighting. Except for the north, where the "Victory" Detachment on the Wolong and Tiejun Mountains above could be responded to with signal flares, the remaining east, west, and south sides were surrounded by the Communist Army. The Communist Army launched a fierce attack with a company as the unit. After the first company was almost completely killed or injured, the second company continued to rush up, creating a situation where it was impossible to win and impossible to defend. In the end, the troops and us were mixed together,抢砲 and夺枪 each other. The "Young" Detachment had a heavy machine gun that was taken away by the Communist Army. The shooter ignored pulling the fire and used a grenade instead of an iron hammer to smash the enemy's head before taking back the machine gun. From this, it can be seen what a dangerous situation the battle entered on the night of the 11th.</p>
<p>That night, the Communist Army made a major mistake in its command. If they had not surrounded the position of the "Young" Detachment after breaking through Houjia Village and reaching Luotuozi, but had directly attacked Wolong and Tiejun Mountains, and at the same time夹出 the "Victory" Detachment with the Communist Army guarding the city, leaving only a small part to contain the "Young" Detachment, it would have bestowed an unimaginable encounter on the National Army. But they did not do so, but focused on annihilating the "Young" Detachment; unexpectedly, they encountered the "Young" Detachment's calm response, wasting a large amount of the Communist Army's manpower and firepower. If it had not been for the resolute resistance of the "Young" Detachment, the arrival of reinforcements on the afternoon of the 12th would not have been able to save the critical situation of the outer Jining battle. Therefore, the "Young" Detachment was awarded the championship of various departments in the 12th War Zone in the Jining Campaign.</p>
<p>Help Came From Heaven</p>
<p>After dawn on the 12th, the situation of the National Army's outer encirclement had gradually improved. Because the Communist Army suffered very heavy casualties on the night of the 11th, after dawn the next day, the area around the position of the "Young" Detachment was covered with corpses wearing gray military uniforms. There were about 7,800 of them, but the situation was still critical before the reinforcements arrived. The courageous commander of the "Lijin" Headquarters did not wait for the reinforcements to die at that time, and let the "Victory" Detachment attack the city bravely. At the same time, he transferred the "Young" Detachment to Wolong Mountain and the "Yellow River" Detachment to Tiejun Mountain for defense, to build a small defense line. When the reinforcements arrived, the "Victory" Detachment had already broken into the city and controlled most of Qiaoxi.</p>
<p>The reinforcing "Guoguang" Detachment was ordered to depart from Zhuozi Mountain on the night of the 11th, and fought a field battle station by station with the Communist Army along the railway line. They fought while running, and arrived in the suburbs of Jining at 3:00 PM. They fired two cannons first 20 miles away, both hitting the Communist Army's position outside Jining, and the Communist Army immediately panicked. Zhuozi Mountain is 180 miles away from Jining, and the Communist Army sent out three brigades to obstruct the advance of our reinforcements. According to the Communist Army's estimation, the National Army's reinforcements would not arrive until the morning of the 13th at the earliest, and the Communist Army could annihilate all the National Army attacking the city on the night of the 12th. Unexpectedly, the "Guoguang" Detachment arrived at 4:00 PM on the 12th, running all the way. Therefore, the Communist Army believed that the National Army's rescue soldiers flew from heaven. At that time, the Communist Army's good dream was shattered by the two cannons of the "Guoguang" Detachment, and their morale suddenly plummeted, and the formation showed signs of shaking.</p>
<p>After the "Guoguang" Detachment arrived, the "Victory" Detachment was encouraged by the excitement, and before dark, they captured several strongholds in Jining Qiaoxi. The stubborn Communist Army was still unwilling at this time, trying to make a final struggle. Therefore, after dark, the Communist Army's outer forces attacked the position of the "Guoguang" Detachment, and the command post was also attacked. That night, the Communist Army's wave-like charge reached as many as seven times, and in the end, the Communist Army's last burst of energy was extinguished by the firepower of the "Guoguang" Detachment. On the 13th, while our army continued to expand its battle results in the city, it drew out the "Yellow River" Detachment and the "Guoguang" Detachment to completely disperse the Communist Army in the Luotuozi area. Extending until sunset, the Communist Army's garrison troops were completely driven out of Jining by the National Army.</p>
<h3>Gruesome Street Fights</h3>
<p>Breakthrough at the Southwest Corner</p>
<p>On the morning of the 12th, at 7:00 AM, Liu, the commander of the "Victory" detachment, after entrusting the positions on Iron Army and Wolong Mountains to the "Yellow River" and "Youth" detachments for defense, led the second and third battalions to attack the southwest corner of Jining City under orders. At this time, the "Yellow River" and "Youth" detachments, in addition to dealing with the enemy on the periphery, also had to cover the "Victory" detachment's attack on the city, a considerably heavy task. In this battle of Jining, the National Army did not have new-style weapons. Our main tactic was to use heavy machine guns to suppress the Communist army, preventing them from raising their heads, and then send engineers to detonate the enemy's defenses with explosives. The two barracks outside the southwest corner of Jining City and the Gospel Hall south of the city were captured quickly and successively using this tactic, relying on soldiers who were not afraid of sacrifice. When breaking through the southwest corner, howitzers were concentrated on a single point to shatter the city wall, and the fallen wall was used to obscure the [illegible character]. Although the enemy had formed a crossfire network within the city to seal the breach, it could not stop our soldiers from charging in with machine guns. As soon as the thunderous artillery fire stopped, a cloud of yellow dust rose from the southwest corner of Jining City. When the dust was blown away by the wind, four or five courtyards were already flying the bright red national flag. When we first entered the southwest corner, there were only two companies, less than two hundred men. Taking advantage of the smoke and dust, they sent a company to seize the flour company near the South Gate. A battalion of enemies guarding the flour company were stunned by the shouts of the National Army, and the sixth company of the third battalion of the "Victory" detachment calmly jumped over the wall.</p>
<p>After the infantry controlled seven or eight courtyards in the southwest corner of the city, artillery carriages followed them in. The Communist army's machine gun bullets struck the artillery shields and fell to the ground. The most miraculous sight on the morning of the 12th was the appearance of more than a hundred ammunition-laden carts, which arrived in the city only ten minutes after the breakthrough at the southwest corner, seemingly from nowhere. Like a mighty cavalry and chariot force, the enemy thought many National Army troops had entered the city. This caused the Communist army entrenched in houses to abandon their positions and flee, vacating many defensible courtyards for the National Army. At this time, many Communist soldiers threw their guns into the street and raised their hands in surrender.</p>
<p>Attack on the Post and Telegraph Office</p>
<p>After the National Army broke through the southwest corner, order within the city was briefly disrupted. Later, the Communist army headquarters sent an enforcement team to supervise the battle. Anyone running from the southwest, whether National Army or Communist army, was indiscriminately sprayed with machine gun fire. Political personnel spread favorable rumors to consolidate the wavering morale. Subsequently, the street fighting in the city evolved into a struggle for houses. Most Communist soldiers, under the supervision of political personnel, did not dare to surrender their weapons. They were mostly sealed off in their houses by the National Army with machine guns covering doors and windows, and then killed by hand grenades thrown down the chimneys. When the war ended and the battlefield was cleared, we found seven or eight corpses in each house.</p>
<p>Shortly after the "Victory" detachment entered the southwest corner of Jining, the "Yellow River" detachment also broke through the West Gate, pinning down the Communist army west of the bridge in various strongholds, awaiting their beating. The enemy west of the bridge had several important strongholds, including the Post and Telegraph Office, Yao Zhe's headquarters, the police station, and the Mengjiang Bank. The "Victory" detachment first attacked the Post and Telegraph Office. Four heavy machine guns were placed on the roof of the post office, controlling the main road and the exits of various streets and lanes. Because Liu, the commander of the "Victory" detachment, was very familiar with the terrain inside Jining City, he directed engineers to break through various houses, ordering artillery carriages to be pulled to an alley directly facing the Post and Telegraph Office, and conducted guided fire from a distance of two hundred meters. At the same time, he contacted the artillery on Iron Army Mountain by telephone to also fire at the smoky area. As a result, the Post and Telegraph Office was abandoned after being hit by seven artillery shells.</p>
<p>Each street corner in Jining City was equipped with hidden bunkers. After the "Victory" detachment occupied the Post and Telegraph Office, they used two heavy machine guns captured from the enemy to suppress the firepower from the east side of the bridge from the upper floor of the Post and Telegraph Office, while ordering infantry to climb onto the hidden bunkers and throw hand grenades into the firing ports, killing all the Communist soldiers inside to clear the corridors. Consequently, most of the National Army's attacking soldiers suffered hand and leg injuries. After the National Army cleared the main road in front of the Post and Telegraph Office, they set up howitzers at the intersection of the main road and North Street, bombarding Yao Zhe's headquarters on the east side of North Street. As soon as the shells stopped exploding in the headquarters compound, the comrades of the "Victory" detachment, like divine soldiers, leaped out of the shops across the street and raised the national flag on the roof of the house where Yao Zhe usually resided.</p>
<p>Communist Army Counterattacks on Two Fronts</p>
<p>When we occupied the Post and Telegraph Office and were besieging Yao Zhe's headquarters, the Communist army defending the city dispatched two regiments to counterattack. One regiment bypassed the West Gate from the railway fence north of the city, attacking the National Army; the other regiment attacked the Qingzhen Temple near the South Gate from the tunnel fence south of the city. At that time, we had very few troops in the city. The combined forces on Wolong and Iron Army Mountains were still confronting the enemy's outer forces. The troops in the city had to defend the acquired strongholds on the one hand, and continue to expand the battle results on the other. Therefore, our tactic for dealing with the Communist army's counterattack was not to meet them head-on, but to cut them off in the middle, preventing them from advancing too far.</p>
<p>In the first phase, the Communist army's two counterattacking units successfully recaptured the Qingzhen Temple near the West Gate and the South Gate. In the second phase, because we also dispatched two units to occupy the two railway fences, cutting off their retreat. Later, after the artillery fire of the "Guoguang" detachment was heard, we transferred the first battalion of the "Victory" detachment from outside the city, and parts of the "Youth" and "Yellow River" detachments to assist in the battle, and recaptured the West Gate and the Qingzhen Temple. We destroyed the Communist army's headquarters, and they retreated to the line of Mengjiang Bank and the police station to resist. Yao Zhe personally supervised the battle and launched a second counterattack. Therefore, the West Gate and the Qingzhen Temple were contested several times, and both sides suffered heavy casualties. The National Army even used the corpses of Communist soldiers to build meat bags for combat.</p>
<p>Before dark, we successively recovered the West Gate and the Qingzhen Temple. The Communist army built positions at the Mengjiang Bank, the northern railway fence, the police academy, the water tower, the railway station and other places, and confronted the National Army. That night, the outer war was still fierce. The Communist army in the city suffered heavy casualties during the day, and the soldiers dispatched lay on the ground and dared not move forward. The National Army only heard gunshots in the distance, and no Communist army was found near the strongholds. At the same time, we encircled the east side of the bridge with lightly armed units, so the Communist army could not take care of both the east and west sides of the bridge. Originally, the Communist army could have taken advantage of the night to recapture the lost strongholds, but because the morale was extremely low and the commander could not supervise the soldiers, they failed to reverse the critical situation in Jining.</p>
<p>The Last Day of Destiny</p>
<p>September 13th was the last day the Communist army occupied Jining. In the morning, the Communist army's outer array was disordered. We transferred most of the troops from the "Youth" and "Yellow River" detachments into the city to consolidate the strongholds, and ordered the "Victory" detachment to continue attacking the strongholds. Before sunset, the police academy, the Mengjiang Bank, and the northern railway fence were captured, and the west side of the bridge was completely occupied. On this day, the Communist army still tried to break free and resisted fiercely. Especially at noon, in order to wait for the darkness to retreat, they launched even more ferocious counterattacks. The garrison of each house, under the supervision of Communist Party members, would never give up easily unless they were completely killed by the National Army. According to the common people, in several courtyards, the soldiers killed the party members before retreating.</p>
<p>In the Battle of Jining, many Communist soldiers showed extreme tenacity. The squad guarding the railway station water tower, equipped with two light machine guns, supported the west side of the bridge from morning to dusk on the 13th, preventing the National Army from smoothly entering the east side of the bridge through the railway. More than two hundred people were killed or injured. When it was almost dark, we used many artillery shells to shoot into the windows, killing the Communist army inside. This water tower was more than four meters high and was completely made of reinforced concrete. It required precise shooting to hit the windows. In the entire Battle of Jining, the dozen or so Communist soldiers guarding the water tower showed the most stubborn resistance.</p>
<p>Tiger Mountain, the most famous mountain in Jining, did not play an important role in this battle. Originally, on the morning of the 13th, when the street fighting in the city was fierce, most of the guard battalion of the "Sui-Mongolian Military Region" withdrew from Tiger Mountain and was captured from behind by a small number of people sent by the "Victory" detachment. They saw that Tiger Mountain had fallen and that the situation was gone, so they only resisted at the railway station, the railway hospital, the locomotive yard and other places for two or three hours. After the National Army broke through these strongholds, at 11:00 PM, the Communist army launched a fierce counterattack. After that, we felt that the sound of gunfire was sparse. When we arrived at the power company and the county government, there was no one. Only then did we know that the Communist army used the tactic of fierce attack and rapid retreat, escaping in small groups.</p>

<p>Map of Jining Pursuit Battle (Special Drawing by This Newspaper's Archives)</p>
<h3>Jining Pursuit Battle</h3>
<p>After the Communist army collapsed on the night of September 13th, they retreated in three directions. The troops of the "Jin-Cha-Ji Military Region" retreated from Xinghe to Chaigoubao, the troops of the "Jin-Sui Military Region" retreated from Liangcheng to Zuoyun, and the troops of the "Sui-Mongolian Military Region" retreated to Fengzhen first, and then turned to Zuoyun to join the troops of the "Jin-Sui Military Region". The Communist army's civilian personnel and the gold, silver, opium, and cloth plundered from the people were moved to the mountains of Yanbei as early as after the fall of Zhuozi Mountain, and the grain was stored in shops and farmers' homes near Jining. They claimed that this was a strategic retreat, and if the people handed over the items deposited by the Communist army to the National Army, they would be severely retaliated against. Therefore, in the Battle of Jining, the National Army did not receive other materials except for the weapons captured, which were nearly two brigades' worth of equipment.</p>
<p>Communist Army Retreat Directions</p>
<p>During this Communist army rout, most of the strongmen drafted in Suidong and Chaharbei abandoned their weapons and fled home. The strongmen in the area of [illegible character]bei went up the mountains to become bandits, hoping that the National Army would send people to recruit them. Most of the strongmen near Hebei and Wutai were able to retreat with the army, but it was very chaotic. Only Nie Rongzhen's basic troops and He Long's 358th Brigade marched in four columns to the southeast and northwest. They had covering troops resisting the National Army stubbornly on both wings, letting the wounded walk in front, and the light machine gunners walked behind while fighting. If the National Army's pursuing troops were too small, they could turn around and counterattack. Therefore, our pursuing cavalry specialized in intercepting these two troops. As a result, they charged in a chaotic manner.</p>
<p>The Communist army usually conducted two types of education for soldiers: never surrender, and never lose your gun. Political personnel spread propaganda that the National Army treated prisoners of war particularly cruelly, killing them using various terrifying methods, and stipulated that anyone who lost their weapons would be killed without exception. If a soldier surrendered, his family members would also be severely punished. The pursuing troops discovered many Communist soldiers who committed suicide by pulling the fuse of hand grenades under their heads after being surrounded, never surrendering their guns to us while alive. Sometimes they would put down their guns and wait for our soldiers to go to inspect them, then use hand grenades to die together. Therefore, when the National Army encountered the Communist army, the soldiers did not listen to the orders of their officers and swept them with machine guns. Therefore, fewer of the defeated Communist army were captured alive by us than were killed by us.</p>
<p>Iron Cavalry Charges Wildly</p>
<p>The "Revival" Column placed the "Iron Cavalry" Detachment southwest of the railway line and the "Green Mountain" Detachment northeast of the railway line as the outermost patrol units of the Jining [illegible character]. The "Iron Cavalry" Detachment moved back and forth between Liangcheng and Jining like lightning, making it difficult for the Communist army to grasp their movements. Wherever they went, they would encounter the "Iron Cavalry." On September 5th, the Communist army reinforcing Zhuozi Mountain and retreating from Zhuozi Mountain gathered in the Niujia Chuan area south of Zhuozi Mountain, attempting to retreat to Liangcheng. Unexpectedly, they were surrounded by the "Iron Cavalry" in Wulichang. After an hour of battle, the enemy was completely crushed, more than 300 people were killed, more than 200 people were captured, and the rest were scattered in the mountains and fields.</p>
<p>On the 13th, when the Communist army retreated from Jining, the "Iron Cavalry" transferred from Liangcheng to Sanyitang, more than 20 miles west of the city, on the afternoon of the 12th. On the morning of the 14th, the "Iron Cavalry" set off from Hulu Satai near Sanyangtang, pursuing the Communist army on the road to Liangcheng, specializing in attacking the 358th Brigade. They chased for fifty miles and dispersed the 6th and 8th Regiments of the 358th Brigade in Mamitu, which belonged to Fengzhen County. In this battle, more than 300 people were killed, more than 100 people were captured, and the captured spoils included 200 rifles, as well as multiple 60mm mortars and Russian-style light machine guns. The enforcement battalion commander of the 358th Brigade, the political commissar of the 8th Regiment, and the commander of the 6th Regiment were killed by the hooves of the "Iron Cavalry" horses, and the latter was wounded by a saber. Our cavalry fired from horseback, as brave as the Cossack cavalry of Russia. The Communist army slandered us, saying that there were Americans participating.</p>
<p>After the "Iron Cavalry" dispersed the 358th Brigade, on the morning of the 18th, they eliminated more than 200 remaining members of the Communist army's "Sui-Mongolian Military Region" Cavalry Brigade led by Kang Jianmin at the Xin'anzhuang Lian Station, and took the opportunity to recover Fengzhen County. They also successively recovered strongholds such as Longshengzhuang, and arrived at Xinghe County on the afternoon of the 19th. Xinghe County was first entered by the "Great Wall" Detachment of the "Revival" Column. The Communist army found that there were very few people, so they transferred two regiments from the "4th Military Sub-district of Jin-Cha-Ji" to counterattack from Chaigoubao. Unexpectedly, the "Iron Cavalry" and "Green Mountain" Detachments arrived one after another during the day on the 29th, so on the night of the 29th, the Communist army's two regiments were completely surrounded by the "Iron Cavalry" and "Green Mountain" on the outskirts of Xinghe City. They either surrendered or died, and no one ran back to Chaigoubao.</p>
<p>Green Mountain: The Wind Howls, the Cranes Cry</p>
<p>The "Green Mountain" Detachment departed from Wuchuan on September 30th, and arrived on the outskirts of Jining City on the day the "Youth" Detachment attacked Zhuozi Mountain. The "Green Mountain" Detachment focused on annihilating the Communist army's only cavalry, the Kang Jianmin Brigade of the "Sui-Mongolian Military Region." On the night of the 5th, they defeated a regiment of Kang Jianmin at Datuchengzi, 25 miles north of Jining City. Later, two regiments were transferred to reinforce the counterattack, but they were also defeated by the "Green Mountain" Detachment. By dark on the 7th, the "Green Mountain" Detachment had arrived in the Beiyingzi and Tanmi areas on the outskirts of Jining City. That night, the commander of the "Revival" Column personally commanded the "Green Mountain" Detachment to launch eight fierce attacks on the Jining City wall, once breaking into the northwest city and attacking the Communist army's rear.</p>
<p>During the Battle of Jining, the Green Mountain Detachment operated in the northeastern suburbs of Jining City. After the Communist army collapsed on the night of the 13th, the "Green Mountain" Detachment was responsible for pursuing the retreating Communist army north of the railway line. That night, the troops of the "Jin-Ji-Cha Military Region" were dispersed in the Laopingdiquan and Rose Camp areas. The strangest thing was that there were more than 1,500 Communist troops stationed in the Laocaoquan area. They did not know that Jining had fallen, and as a result, they were driven away by more than 300 people from the Second Battalion of the "Youth" Detachment. On the morning of the 14th, the "Green Mountain" Detachment found Nie Rongzhen's main force in Honghaizi and surrounded two regiments of the Communist army, killing more than 500 people, capturing 300 people, and seizing more than 400 various guns. The remaining Communist army went to Mopan Mountain and escaped. Afterwards, the "Green Mountain" Detachment searched south along the railway and joined forces with Ma Zhanshan's troops from Datong at Baoziwan on the afternoon of the 18th.</p>
<p>People's Anger in Suidong</p>
<p>The Communist Party's administrative personnel in Sui had already buried very deep hatred in the people's [illegible character] sinews. In the past, because the rule was extremely strict, they did not dare to express resistance. This time, after the Communist army collapsed in Jining, they vented their nameless anger on the strongmen coerced by the Communist army. This evolved into very cruel mutual killings among the peasants. Our administrative personnel could not think of an effective way to stop this anger of the common people. A total of 80,000 people from the Communist army participated in the Battle of Jining. 20,000 were killed by the National Army, 15,000 were injured, 5,000 surrendered, and 20,000 escaped to Zuoyun and Chaigoubao. The remaining more than 20,000 people, accounting for more than a quarter of the total force, were completely eliminated by the people of Suidong.</p>
<p>Most of the Communist army that had been scattered by the National Army left their units and spread into the villages. The people of Suidong are particularly tough. In the past, they produced great bandits such as Lu Zhankui and Su Yusheng. Therefore, seeing that the Communist army's situation was gone, they all rose up to "take advantage of the fire to rob." The Communist army conducted four nocturnal battles in Jining, and most of them were exhausted and their horses were exhausted. Furthermore, they were chased by cavalry, spitting blood from their mouths and noses. Every time they arrived at a place, they would fall asleep with their heads covered, and the common people took this opportunity to seize their guns. In order to silence them and [illegible character] in the future, few Communist soldiers who lost their guns were able to survive. Most of them were strangled to death with ropes by the common people and buried in the mountains. Some of the porters carrying the wounded also killed the wounded with stones in order to reduce the burden, and then dropped their stretchers and fled.</p>
<p>The people's revenge actions against the Communist army were partly due to anger, and partly due to the need for self-defense. Originally, the self-defense strength of the people of Suidong was quite sufficient. In the 25th year, when the Japanese and puppet troops in Chaharbei attacked Honggeertu and Tumuerte, the defending troops mainly relied on the militia to repel the Japanese invaders. After the Anti-Japanese War, more than 10,000 cavalry were established in the five counties of Suidong alone. Later, the Japanese and puppets collected all the guns owned by the people, and they obeyed the Communist army when they came. This time, the Communist army failed, so there was no reason not to seize their guns. It is difficult to investigate the weapons left by the Communist army to the people. We only know that the returning troops of Fengzhen increased from 200 guns to 2,000 guns after the Battle of Jining. Furthermore, the price of guns in Fengzhen was half the price of Gui Sui.</p>
<h3>A Glimpse of the National Army's Life on the Banks of the Songhua River - Image Description</h3>
<p>An army from the southwest corner (Yunnan) – the 60th Army of the Army – has travelled all the way to the distant Northeast to take over, disregarding glory and fatigue. It once showed its skills in the great victory of Taierzhuang, and a division of Japanese invaders was wiped out by them. Later, they fought in the battles of western Hunan and southern Jiangxi. After the victory, they were ordered to go overseas to show their power, and were responsible for accepting surrender in Haiphong.</p>
<p>Leading this elite army is General Zeng Zesheng, a battle-hardened hero of the Anti-Japanese War. His subordinates have maintained a fine tradition, received good training, and fought courageous battles.</p>
<p>What is shown here is only a small part of their life, but at least it can reflect a glimpse of the National Army's life.</p>

<h3>Outstanding Construction in Taiwan Province: The Chianan Irrigation System, a Water Conservancy Project</h3>
<p>— Taipei Air Dispatch on the 16th, by Special Correspondent Mu Yun of this Newspaper</p>
<p>How great is water conservancy! Overflowing, it nurtures all things. — Chen Yi</p>
<p>The Chianan Irrigation System, a representative work of water conservancy in Taiwan Province, is worthy of introduction to the mainland. The origin of water conservancy projects in Taiwan Province did not begin with the Japanese, who ruled for fifty-one years. As early as the seventeenth year of the Daoguang era, Cao Jin, the magistrate of Fengshan County (now Kaohsiung County), witnessed the suffering of the people in Kaohsiung and Fengshan counties due to the lack of water conservancy. He dredged the Xiadanshui River, and after four years, the old canal, stretching for five li, was completed. Later, it was extended from sixteen kilometers to thirty-two kilometers, and the irrigated rice paddies expanded from thirty-six thousand mu to sixty-seven thousand mu. To commemorate his achievements, later generations named the dyke "Cao Gong Canal."</p>
<p>On the way to Ershui, this reporter visited the Lin Gong Shrine. It is said that Lin Gong was a water conservancy expert in the Taichung area. After completing the construction during the Qing Dynasty, this person disappeared. At the time, only his surname Lin was known, so the Lin Gong Temple was built to commemorate this deity.</p>
<p>Therefore, when discussing water conservancy, people should mention the Chianan Irrigation System, but they must not forget that it is simply an expansion of our ancient methods.</p>
<p>Ten Years of Construction</p>
<p>How much effort the Japanese put into Taiwan is understood in general terms by those who first arrived in the province. Taking the Chianan Irrigation System as an example, construction began in September of the ninth year of the Republic of China, costing a total of 42 million yen. Due to financial difficulties, the project was delayed three times, and the cost increased to over 54.13 million yen (26 million was borne by the government, and the remainder was distributed among local assembly members). The construction period was also extended by ten years.</p>
<p>In addition to strengthening agricultural irrigation and increasing the production of the colony of Taiwan, this great water conservancy project also had political significance. Naturally, they aimed to win the hearts of the people in the southern plains through construction.</p>
<p>Chief Executive Chen Yi made a special trip to inspect the system on the seventh of this month. Witnessing this great project, he wrote the phrase "How great is water conservancy! Overflowing, it nurtures all things." The Jinghu-Pingkun reporter group, during their important visit, included the Chianan Irrigation System in their itinerary, in addition to Sun Moon Lake. This clearly shows that it has attracted attention from all sides! Chief Executive Chen deeply feels that the current issue is how to complete the construction that the Japanese were unable to finish, in order to gain the trust of the people. The problem is that the majority of people are "numb and apathetic"!</p>
<p>Employees</p>
<p>The Chianan Irrigation System covers nine districts of Tainan County and the two cities of Tainan and Chiayi. Within this vast area, there are over 150,000 households and one million people. The irrigated farmland directly benefiting from the system amounts to 2.3 million mu. This will be the sole economic value of the system.</p>
<p>This area is divided into water supply zones of approximately 2,300 mu each. Within each water supply zone, there are small water supply canals and small drainage canals, rationally maintaining the distribution and management of the canal water. Each water supply zone is divided into three smaller zones: one for summer rice cultivation, one for dry-season autumn and winter sugarcane cultivation, and one for miscellaneous crops. A three-year rotation system is adopted to economically and effectively regulate the water supply.</p>
<p>The Water Conservancy Section of the Construction Bureau of the Tainan County Government and the Chianan Irrigation Association are under the jurisdiction of the government. However, due to the vast scope and complexity of the affairs, a separate headquarters has been established, with over 100,000 members (including landowners and tenant farmers). There are currently 1,150 employees handling business, supervision, irrigation, and the maintenance of drainage and protective structures for waterways.</p>
<p>Concrete Construction</p>
<p>The water source of the Chianan Irrigation System, like the Sun Moon Lake Power Plant, is the Wushantou Reservoir, with an elevation of 66 meters. It utilizes natural valleys to form a coral-like shape, with a water storage area of 11,000,000 square feet, an effective storage capacity of 660 million cubic feet, and a water depth of up to 160 feet. The maximum water intake is 1,800 cubic feet per second. This uses a spiral-type water gate made of reinforced concrete to regulate and draw water from the Zengwen River. Below the weir dam at an elevation of 220 feet (56 meters), there is a water delivery tower with a flow rate of one to two and a half feet per second. The river water passes through a tunnel extending 3,108 meters and then flows along the 28-li main line, branching out into 300-li secondary canals and 1,850-li small irrigation channels.</p>
<p>Outside the reservoir, there are also intakes on the left bank of the Zhuoshui River, including the Linnei First, Second, and Zhongguozhi intakes, located below the bank protection of the river. The function of the Chianan Irrigation System is not only to draw water but also to drain water. It has 1,740 li of drainage channels. To prevent floods, tides, and disasters, it has 83 li of embankments, 170 li of dedicated telephone lines, and short-distance railways.</p>
<p>The entire project is constructed entirely of concrete and natural cobblestones. Standing on the weir dam beside the reservoir and looking out over the fertile Tainan Plain, one cannot help but admire the greatness of human engineering. Combined with the distribution of electricity, this area can be said to have achieved industrialized agriculture in the countryside. The livelihoods of millions of farmers, the prosperity or decline of the entire province's agricultural economy, and the allocation of food are all tied to this!</p>
<p>Expanding Water Sources</p>
<p>The budget for the 34th year of the Republic of China was 48,176,243 yuan for both revenue and expenditure. The supplementary budget was 23,138,970 yuan for both revenue and expenditure. The entire revenue department consists of irrigation rent and maintenance fees, with ordinary water rent at 420 yuan per year and special water rent at 17 yuan, totaling an income of 80 million yuan. In the 35th year, the planned repair engineering fee for the association is 7.83 million yuan, and the disaster recovery engineering fee allocated by the Relief Administration and other agencies is 12.89 million yuan. This restoration project includes expanding the weir dam and repairing drainage channels. According to their report, the original planned irrigation area was 2.3 million mu (150,000 chia), but in the 27th year, the actual irrigated farmland was only slightly over 2.9 million mu (the rice harvest in the 34th year was 39,281,300 jin, with an average yield of 2,100 jin per 15 mu). If this expansion plan is completed, the reservoir's storage capacity can be increased by one-eleventh, allowing all water-deficient farmland to be irrigated!</p>
<p>However, considering the total area of the Southern Plain, the irrigable farmland that the Chianan Irrigation System can supply only accounts for one-third of the total (with one rice crop every three years in a rotation system). Therefore, the people of the county are also requesting the use of the reservoir formed by a major earthquake in the Caoling area. The Tainan County Government has specifically budgeted 1.5 million yuan this year for the survey of this project and has sent personnel to manage the weir dam. This naturally formed large reservoir saves a great deal of construction costs, but because it is naturally formed, it contains various vulnerabilities and requires technical review. There is still much work to be done!</p>
<p>Regarding this irrigation system, this reporter has some feelings. Why can't agriculture in the mainland (and even the Jiangnan region) actively produce, and instead allow wastelands and disasters to occur due to drought and floods? The water conservancy project in Taiwan Province serves as a profound lesson!</p>

<h3>Late Autumn in Changchun</h3>
<p>— Air dispatch on the 9th, by Shenyang-based Correspondent Zhao Zhan of this Newspaper</p>
<p>The willows sway gently, the sky is clear and blue, and the late autumn in Changchun is still very lovely. However, when the northeasterly winds and sand rise, it shows that autumn is about to end, and people are about to hibernate in the long cold winter.</p>
<p>Between war and peace, people want to seek a definitive answer, but the question is not easy to answer. This winter has come early, especially in Rehe, where the climate is already very cold. The climate of tall autumn and stout horses can no longer be used. The battles around Chifeng are fierce, and soldiers coming from the south are already accustomed to fighting in the icy and snowy conditions. The National Army wants to seize Chifeng and eliminate the Communist forces within Rehe. The military says that this is an easy task. The "spark" ignited by the Communist forces in Liaobei shows a tendency to expand, and its effect is clearly to echo the flames of war in Rehe. From Zhangjiakou to the northeast, through Weichang, Chifeng, Kailu, Beilu to Harbin, a line is extended, linking major and minor battles together. This winter in the Northeast is greatly not peaceful. The Songhua River water may flow quietly. We boldly predict that the Songhua River will freeze in a stalemate. The Communist forces are still preparing to withdraw from Harbin to Jiamusi. General Du Yuming calmly said: Whether the Northeast is stable depends on the actions of the Communist forces.</p>
<p>The war has destroyed the countryside, conscripting men and requisitioning military grain. Farmers groan under the heavy burden. Strong men have left the countryside, and the lack of rural labor has greatly reduced grain production. The capital that farmers recover from the land cannot balance the ever-rising prices, which determines the tragic fate of the farmers. They utter painful cries for help after a victorious autumn harvest. According to statistics from the Northeast Branch of the Executive Yuan Relief Administration, 3 million farmers need urgent relief, and 150,000 refugees have no clothes or food. The number may be even higher in the Communist areas. This year, farmers will spend a desperate winter.</p>

<p>Production and Construction</p>
<h3>Opening of the National Products Exhibition Market</h3>
<p>— Editor</p>
<p>The National Products Exhibition Market, organized by the Shanghai Branch of the China Production Promotion Association and others, has recently opened. Although the scope and layout may not be considered grand or perfect, the fact that such a market has appeared at a time when national product manufacturers are facing extremely difficult conditions can at least be said to be a major event since the victory.</p>
<p>In European and American countries, there are many precedents for national product exhibitions. In the past, Britain had the British Industries Fair, and Germany held a grand exhibition in Leipzig every year. Their scale, scope, and the precision of their displays and layouts can be said to be grand events held annually.</p>
<p>However, the meaning is exactly the same as that of the National Products Exhibition Market. That is to arouse the interest, belief, and recognition of the people in national products, thereby creating a psychology, which is the slogan formulated by the National Products Promotion Movement: "Using national products is the most glorious thing."</p>
<p>This writer believes that this exhibition should have a dual meaning. On the producer side, it can be used as a starting point to promote and improve their products. On the consumer side, it can determine the direction of consumption and use the money of Chinese people to cultivate the industries of Chinese people. In this way, with the close cooperation between production and sales, the future of national products will be bright and promising.</p>
<h3>Research on Factory Locations</h3>
<p>— Yan Bingying</p>
<p>It is very clear that various industries tend to concentrate in one or two places. For example, the textile and footwear industries in the United States are famous industries in Massachusetts and Rhode Island. Connecticut has long been the leader in the copper industry, and Pennsylvania is the leader in the carpet industry. However, conversely, industries can also gradually move from one place to another. This is, of course, mostly due to population changes. For example, after the United States developed domestically, its industrial center gradually moved westward, according to the census at the end of 1920, until it reached the vicinity of Whitehall in southwestern Indiana, which is an example. In addition to this general trend of movement, an entire industry can also move from one place to another due to various economic circumstances. For example, several manufacturing industries that originally developed in the New England States are now almost completely leaving New England because the economic relations of raw materials and markets make these industries more profitable in the western states.</p>
<p>Three Factory Needs: Market, Raw Materials, Labor</p>
<p>However, there are also several states that developed first, which, although they do not have raw materials, are still able to maintain several industries very firmly and are strong competitors with states that not only have sufficient raw materials but also have the same, if not better, transportation facilities to transport manufactured goods. Examples include the textile industry in New England, the jewelry industry in Rhode Island, and the copper industry in Connecticut. Therefore, the geographical trend of industrial centers is indeed an important factor in selecting industrial locations, and it is worth paying attention to this factor when planning a new industry or planning to move an old industry.</p>
<p>Using a Jeep to drive a threshing machine (Sent by special correspondent for the New York Times)</p>
<p>There are obviously many complex reasons why industries concentrate in certain places. The most important of these are proximity to the market, proximity to raw materials, a sufficient supply of labor, and low capacity costs (either due to proximity to waterfalls or cheap fuel, etc.).</p>
<p>Among the above reasons, the first two are of course the most important, because without raw materials, goods cannot be manufactured, and without a market, manufacturing is useless. In addition, in relatively small areas, this reason is often the most important factor in the problem of selecting industrial locations. Assuming that other conditions are exactly the same, the location of various industries should always be chosen in places close to the market, because the occurrence of an industry is either due to the market's need for it, or due to the entrepreneur's efforts to create this need. Second, the distance from the place of origin of raw materials often has a significant impact, so the result is that a harmonious solution must be sought between the two. However, these two factors are often influenced by transportation issues. For example, if most of a raw material is turned into waste during the manufacturing process, it would be too uneconomical for the manufacturer to transport this raw material from a distant place. Therefore, some industries, such as the paper industry, which needs to rely on forest products, must be located near forests, and the packaging industry must be near the center of the livestock industry, and the pottery industry must be near places with clay. Conversely, although the places of origin of wool in the United States are all in the western states, it seems more economical to manufacture wool fabrics on the Atlantic coast. These are all related to the convenience or inconvenience of transportation. Also, once a copper mine is mined, its ore must be dissolved near the mine, because it is impossible to transport this kind of thing to a distant place. However, the places that produce copper, such as Montana, after melting the copper ore into copper bars, can economically transport the copper bars to Connecticut, make various utensils, and then repeatedly transport the copper utensils needed by Montana back to the state. However, we must also know that if the transportation problem is not very important economically, then the impact of the distance between the market and the source of raw materials is not very important. In other words, if transportation costs are very low, then the last two influences, labor and capacity, or any one of the two, can become important factors, and products and raw materials can be economically transported back and forth over extremely large distances, and occupy a superior position in the market. However, this is also very rare. Any one of the above reasons can independently determine the location of an industry. They often combine with other reasons to have an impact; therefore, when we decide on an industrial location, we must study it in detail. What we need to know now is only that the two influences of labor and capacity can also affect the industrial locations determined by the ordinary factors mentioned above in a larger area.</p>
<p>The Environment is Changing</p>
<p>In general, the economic environment in which an industry occurs can often change. This situation is especially obvious in newly developing countries such as the United States. Therefore, if this change is relatively large, the developed industry can also be affected and move to a very distant place. Conversely, various industries are often deeply rooted and flourish in one place, even though the economic environment in that place has long been unfavorable to that industry. These characteristics that cause the developed industry to stay in one place are of course caused by many influences, and one of the most important of these is the supply of labor. Because it takes a long time to create an industrial society, and after this society is created, they cannot be moved as easily as machines. As for skilled workers, generally speaking, they are unwilling to leave their hometowns easily unless they have relatively high wages. Even if they have high wages, they sometimes feel dissatisfied with the new environment, and are easily disappointed, and immediately want to return to their hometown. Therefore, if an industry has flourished in one place, it must have developed a characteristic at the same time, and it is not easy to move. For example, many industries in New England were just accidental opportunities when they first occurred. After these industries have developed, other similar industries, either separated or concurrently operated, have also developed accordingly; therefore, the specialization effect also develops auxiliary or affiliated industries, and much local capital is also invested in it, and the influence of these characteristics is enough to offset the shortcomings of other economic benefits. Therefore, although most of the economic benefits of developing these businesses in New England have moved to other states, these businesses are still firmly occupying a leading position in their original place of origin. Second, the general public's belief in an industry often tends towards the place where it was originally developed, which is of course another driving force to increase industrial characteristics.

<h3>Introduction to Business Administration</h3>
<p>— Xu Baiyi</p>
<p>Packaging and Transportation</p>
<p>Issue Seven of Production Organizations</p>
<p>After the goods are manufactured, the issue of packaging must be considered, because without packaging, they cannot be sold or transported to various places.</p>
<p>The word "packaging" includes two types of packaging: one is the packaging that contains the goods, usually called decoration. Decoration has a great relationship with the sale of goods, because it is the appearance of the goods. Even if the quality of the goods is very good, but without beautiful decoration, the general public will definitely doubt whether the quality of the goods is reliable after all. Therefore, general manufacturers are very particular about the decoration of goods and must ask experts to design it.</p>
<p>The design of the decoration of goods is no less important than the design of the goods themselves. Sometimes we can also use our decoration to attract customers.</p>
<p>In addition to this decoration, there is also a layer of packaging for transportation, which is packaging such as wooden boxes.</p>
<p>If the cost of the wooden box is calculated separately, then it does not need to be included in the cost of the goods. If it is included and cannot be calculated separately, then it should be included in the cost of the goods.</p>
<p>The packaging problem is worthy of study, and making the packaging meet the standards can really be said to be an art, because effective packaging must be able to meet the following conditions:</p>
<p>(1) The goods packed are fully protected and can resist all external vibrations and damages during transportation.</p>
<p>(2) The cost of packaging must be reasonable and not too high.</p>
<p>(3) The weight of the packaging must not be too heavy, so as not to increase transportation costs.</p>
<p>(4) There must be sufficient padding inside the packaging to prevent the goods from being broken or cracked.</p>
<p>(5) The time required to manufacture the packaging must be as short as possible.</p>
<p>(6) The size of the packaging should be convenient for transportation. If several goods can use similar packaging, then it will be more economical.</p>
<p>A manufacturing plant spends a very considerable amount on packaging every year, so the packaging aspect must be studied. We cannot use flimsy packaging to save costs, nor can we increase the burden on the goods solely for the sake of sturdiness. Here, we can divide the disadvantages of flimsy packaging and too sturdy packaging as follows:</p>
<p>1. Flimsy packaging:</p>
<p>a. Causes damage to the goods.</p>
<p>b. Causes the goods to be lost or dispersed during transit.</p>
<p>c. Causes disputes with customers.</p>
<p>d. Causes the trouble of correspondence and negotiations.</p>
<p>e. Requires more time for transportation.</p>
<p>f. Causes losses from returns.</p>
<p>g. Causes accounts to be delayed and not collected in time.</p>
<p>h. Increases transportation costs.</p>
<p>2. Too sturdy packaging:</p>
<p>a. Increases packaging costs.</p>
<p>b. Causes more space to be occupied due to the thicker wood used.</p>
<p>c. Increases transportation costs due to increased weight.</p>

<p>Spring and Autumn</p>
<h3>Memoir of a Peddler of Ink</h3>
<p>— Bao Yu</p>
<p>In the spring of a certain year, I was traveling from Tunxi to work in a guerrilla zone. Because it was necessary to pass through an occupied area, I was worried about trouble from the enemy. A friend suggested, "The ink from Tunxi is very famous. Carry some with you. In the occupied zone, you can pretend to be an ink merchant as a cover, and you can sell it to brush and ink shops to earn a little money, which can be helpful." I immediately adopted this suggestion.</p>
<p>We all know that the "Hu Kaiwen" ink from Huizhou is famous, but all the ink shops seen on the streets of Tunxi displayed the "Hu Kaiwen" sign, just like "Lu Gaojian" in Suzhou and "Zhang Xiaoquan" in Hangzhou. At the time, I couldn't distinguish between genuine and fake, so I just chose a "Lao Hu Kaiwen" store with a relatively blurred sign and went inside.</p>
<p>Inside, in the window, were displayed all kinds of ink sticks. Some looked like the thick black batons carried by policemen, tied with red tassels hanging there; some were like the slender charcoal sticks used by women for eyebrow drawing, placed in exquisite boxes; some were sculpted into the shape of graceful and slender ladies; some were sculpted into round cakes. All of them were decorated with gold, or red and green patterns and characters, which were very beautiful.</p>
<p>However, these kinds of ink can only be used as "refined people's" toys. I didn't dare to buy them because there weren't many "refined people." In order to consider the sales, I only bought more than ten catties of ordinary, commonly used ink. This was bought with money taken from the travel expenses.</p>
<p>More than ten catties of stuff, carried in a hand that couldn't even restrain a chicken, felt quite strenuous. I barely managed to carry it onto a passenger boat.</p>
<p>About a dozen miles from Tunxi, there was a tax checkpoint. The boat docked, and two inspectors came aboard. They found my more than ten catties of ink and asked for my tax certificate. I was confused and took out the invoice that the ink shop had given me.</p>
<p>"What is this?!" They threw the invoice onto the deck.</p>
<p>"I don't have a tax certificate!"</p>
<p>"How can you do business without paying taxes? You are clearly evading taxes and will be fined!" The inspector put on a stern face.</p>
<p>As a result, I was fined a sum of money.</p>
<p>From Tunxi to the market, I was inspected many times along the way, which was already quite troublesome. Then, from the market to Hangzhou, there were more than a dozen checkpoints set up by puppet police. Many fierce puppet police officers, feeling the heavy things in my bag, insisted that I unpack it. When I opened the bag and the ink was exposed, they still deliberately made things difficult and insisted on receiving money before allowing me to pass. This happened at more than a dozen checkpoints, and I had to pay money at each one. By the time I arrived in Hangzhou, there was no travel money left. On the one hand, I was anxious, and on the other hand, I still had a glimmer of hope: as long as I could sell the ink and raise the price a little, then the travel expenses to my destination would still be enough.</p>
<p>Thinking this, I carried the bag of ink and looked for brush and ink shops. As a "virgin merchant," I shyly went to the shops, always hesitating at the door for a long time before finally going inside. When I mentioned that I had ink to sell, some of them said:</p>
<p>"Now is not like before, the sales of brush and ink have decreased. Almost everyone uses fountain pens and Western ink..."</p>
<p>Some looked at my ink and said, "Fake Hu Kaiwen," and walked away without saying a second word.</p>
<p>I walked many miles on the streets of Hangzhou and entered many brush and ink shops, but in the end, not a single ink stick was sold.</p>
<p>In wartime, merchants are the darlings of the era. Look at who is doing business and not making money. But I only bought a dozen catties of ink, and as a result, not only did I not sell it, but I also had to pay fines and lose money. Is the fate of a poor scholar really so bitter? As I walked along the West Lake, I complained to the blue West Lake.</p>
<p>Complaining is not a solution, so I hardened my heart and went to find a relative I didn't usually want to see. He used to be a teacher but changed careers to become a businessman.</p>
<p>"Brother, you only know how to write articles and don't know the difficulty of doing business! Hahaha... This little ink is only worth two thousand yuan. You should keep it for writing articles!" Since he understood my situation, he ridiculed me as much as possible. What could I say? I could only endure it painfully.</p>
<p>I borrowed some money, took the ink, and arrived at my destination. "Although the business lost money, I am grateful that the title of "ink peddler" allowed me to pass smoothly in front of the enemy." Thinking this, I felt somewhat comforted.</p>
<p>After that, I continued to move to several regions. Apart from giving some ink as gifts to a few friends, I still had a few catties left with me. Every time I passed through an occupied area, I always acted as an "ink peddler." These strips of black ink became my talisman. Even now, although things have changed, there is still some ink left. In my spare time, I take them out and look at the golden characters inscribed on them, such as "Orchid Smoke," "Dragon Gate," and "Five Catty Oil," and recall the past, and I feel a kind of indescribable feeling.</p>
<h3>On He Tianjian's Landscape Paintings from the Perspective of Chinese Painting Creation</h3>
<p>— Shi Chongpeng</p>
<p>Critics say that Chinese painting has been the same for thousands of years, without any change, copying and imitating, again and again, without any creative spirit. This is really a great injustice to Chinese painting because painting itself is the expression of human creative spirit, especially Chinese painting. For example, what did the paintings of the Three Dynasties, Qin, and Han look like? From where did they come to imitate? What did the paintings of the Jin and Tang dynasties look like? From where did they come to imitate? What did the paintings of the Five Dynasties, the Two Song Dynasties, and even the Yuan Dynasty look like? From where did they come to imitate? The painters of the Ming and Qing dynasties liked to imitate the works of ancient people, seeking to be exactly like them, believing that they could also cultivate their nature and emotions. Moreover, they mixed in a reverence for the past; over time, it became a habit, and the spirit of painting creation greatly declined. Even well-known figures like Tang Yin and Dong Qichang also created imitations of "imitating the brushwork of the Song and Yuan dynasties" or "learning from the Dong and Ju styles." It is no wonder that the works of the Four Wangs and Wu Li are so familiar that not a single one is not an imitation! Moreover, they always use the same composition of overlapping rivers and stacked peaks, thousands of hills and myriad valleys, which makes people tired of seeing them and gives them a monotonous and bland feeling. Although a few painters such as Bada Shanren, Shitao, and Shixi could sweep away habits and fully express their creative spirit, they were not noticed at the time.</p>
<p>The composition of Chinese painting, whether it is figures, landscapes, or even flowers and birds, is mostly woven from the interlacing of dots and lines. Figure painting has various line drawing methods, the so-called "iron wire drawing," "floating silk drawing," "olive drawing," etc., eighteen methods; landscape has dozens of kinds of "hemp fiber texture," "unraveling rope texture," "lotus leaf effect," etc.; flower painting has "double hook" and "boneless" methods, etc. These methods have been studied by countless painters for thousands of years. Modern painters born thousands of years later can certainly use them as references. Using these ready-made methods to create new painting artistic conceptions and new brush and ink changes can be developed and utilized by everyone's intelligence and wisdom. If we can do this, it is creation, and we can open up new paths. Therefore, Bada Shanren and Shitao also used the methods of dots, lines, drawing, and texture of ancient people before creating. It is just like the meaning that after the works of Zuo Qiuming and Sima Qian, there were the articles of Han Yu, Liu Zongyuan, Ouyang Xiu, and Su Shi. Although the structure is the same, the thoughts and temperament are different.</p>
<p>The painter He Tianjian from Liangxi, he uses the methods of dots, lines, drawing, and texture of the ancients to create his own works. He has extracted the essence from the works of the Five Dynasties, the Two Song Dynasties, and the Yuan Dynasty, creating masterpieces. During the eight years of the Anti-Japanese War, he cut off all social engagements and painted behind closed doors, accumulating more than two hundred exquisite works. The author has read them one by one. The greatness of the momentum is like Jing Hao and Guan Tong, the depth of the hills and valleys is vaguely like Fan Kuan and Li Cheng, and the elegance of the brush and ink rivals Ni Zan and Huang Gongwang, bringing together the great achievements of famous masters of past dynasties and discovering his own face. For example, in the painting "Return Our Rivers and Mountains," a large green and blue silk painting, he depicts the meaning of a victorious return and celebrating the return to the capital. The attitude of the people cheering and wanting to fly is vividly displayed on the paper! Especially the clothing of men and women and the holding of the blue sky, white sun, and red earth national flag show the spirit of the times, which can be believed to be true. As for the unique techniques of dots, lines, drawing, and rubbing in Chinese painting, they are also fully expressed. Such a famous painting is a standard creation! It is also the face of He Tianjian himself! There are also many landscape paintings depicting the real scenes of famous scenic spots in the north and south, lightly or heavily painted, with a myriad of images, without any monotonous feeling.</p>

<h3>Thoughts on White Clouds</h3>
<p>— Wang Wenbiao</p>
<p>Many people think that there are more ingenious clouds in autumn, and that watching the clouds on the Double Seventh Festival is the highlight of the year; in fact, nature does not create anything "ingenious," and the vast sky will not divide beauty or ugliness by season. But it is true that the autumn sky seems to be a deeper blue when it is clear, which makes the white clouds more beautiful.</p>
<p>I think clouds themselves are an attractive thing, and the feelings they evoke are transcendent, ethereal, and carefree. To put it more clearly, the only thing in the world that can be called noble and pure is this. Therefore, clouds are forever used by people as a symbol of purification, freedom, and everything that is lofty and beyond the secular.</p>
<p>Reading the poems of the ancients about clouds, such as "Just go and don't ask again, white clouds are endless," such as "Sometimes I look at the lonely clouds high," and such as "The cloud follows the shore without intention," I feel a deep sense of transcendence, which is quite thought-provoking. Of course, there is some inevitable sigh in it, but I also feel that only sensitive poets can love white clouds and regard them as a heartfelt meditation and a refuge from worries. For example, in the former's poetic meaning, it is clear that it is imagined as a transcendent "artistic conception." Perhaps this feeling is a bit "ridiculous," and it is thought that the poet is really "foolish," but we have an unavoidable sense of empathy, which naturally emerges when we are disheartened and feel that "the affairs of the world are impossible to do."</p>
<p>Therefore, I have a feeling that the ideas of Laozi and Zhuangzi are also quite related to the artistic conception of clouds. For example, Cui Hao's poem "The Yellow Crane Tower" can be summed up by the sentence "White clouds are empty and leisurely for thousands of years," which shows the meaning of unchanging through kalpas, which is the same as Li Bai's "Only the West River Moon remains today, once it shone on the people in the palace of the King of Wu," and the same shows the regret of life that "old age is approaching." (Li Shangyin's "The sunset is infinitely good, but it is near dusk" can explain the above meaning) The three words "empty and leisurely" can be compared to the "mysterious female," "great purity," and "emptiness" realms in Laozi and Zhuangzi, which are the eternal "thoughts" in people's hearts. Therefore, the sentence "the gate of all wonders" in Laozi can be explained as having the same feeling as "leisurely."</p>
<p>In this way, it can be understood why all the frustrated and sensitive poets in the world love clouds. In my humble study, there is a landscape painting by Wang Dongzhuang, the last sentence of the poem inscribed on it says, "Where is a good place to build a thatched hut? Among the red forests, yellow leaves, and white clouds," which makes me feel even more deeply. In addition, there are those who compare their feelings according to different circumstances, such as Li Bai's sentence "Floating clouds, the intention of a traveler," which writes out the feelings when making guests in other places; and Cen Shen's "Melancholy clouds, miserable wind, ten thousand miles of condensation," carefully savoring the scenery, it is already making people feel all kinds of emotions, sadness cannot be stopped - or it is the scene of "the end of a hero's road."</p>
<p>I once said that you don't have to watch the clouds in autumn, but I deeply feel that only in the autumn wilderness with a bit of coolness can you enjoy those floating white clouds. Yes, the blue sky, dotted with soft, cotton-like white clouds floating in the wind, watching it will give people what kind of reverie!</p>

<h3>In Memory of General Stilwell</h3>
<p>— Xinu</p>
<p>General Stilwell, a great infantry fighter, is dead. Now he has laid down that clumsy 79 rifle and is enjoying a quiet vacation without regrets, the small, beautiful medal sparkling in the Pacific.</p>
<p>In 1942, we lost the battle, dragging muddy, bulletless rifles through the rainy season on earth.</p>
<p>In that vicious "Black Spot," there were no tears, no sighs. You—a troubled old man—led this group of weary brothers with your nose, eyes, and tightly pursed lips.</p>
<p>In India, your face was dark, your figure thin, forgetting that you were a sixty-year-old man (and long-lost beloved wife and daughters), to practice your great ideals, competing with children all day in the scorching Bihar plains. Finally—a brave team stood up, wielding 100,000 bayonets on the training ground in Ramgarh. We could see your joy, your trembling exhortation: "Counterattack Burma, occupy Hukawng!" Your bayonet pointed east, crossing the 8,000-foot Patkai Mountains. Like an iron torrent, your subordinates surged into the desolate valleys, infiltrating Walawbum, Shaduzup, and Shinbwiyang, dawning the light of total victory. Remembering in that fierce battle when we attacked a village, the artillery fire blurred the secluded mountains and forests, bullets whizzing across the sky, you—our commander—sat upright on the firing line, leaning a rifle against your shoulder, not speaking, not eating, just smoking, smoking, and smoking, which worried Commander Sun Liren so much that he intensified the occupation and brought you back to the rear. Now—the war is over, you've worked hard, old man, rest in peace without regrets. Your young Chinese comrades have grown more brave and strong, using the marksmanship you taught to pierce the masks of all conspirators and establish a peaceful and democratic country on the Pacific Ocean near you.</p>
<h3>An Inch of Land, An Inch of Blood 68</h3>
<p>— Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>My brother Hu and I lingered in this family for more than an hour, listening to a tragic story:</p>
<p>Sister Cui's maiden name is Cui He. Her father was a well-known wealthy merchant in Tong County. Since the traitor Yin Rugeng worshiped the Japanese invaders, acting tyrannically in the city, inside and outside the city, and in the neighboring villages, it suddenly became a dark hell, and the misery was exactly the same as Shenyang after the fall; the rich became poor, and the young people who were not conscripted became victims of gambling and drugs; otherwise, they disappeared for no reason. As for women, as long as they were women, few were not ravaged, or even transported to Dalian, Yingkou, Taipei and other places to be comfort women. Sister Cui's father originally wanted to take advantage of the leisure time to escape to Beiping, but he was one step too slow, and was caught by the minions of Yin the traitor, who forcibly added a crime, and not only confiscated the property, but also died in the black prison.</p>
<p>Sister Cui was only fifteen years old at that time, a pure and noble female student, but she was arrested together with her mother by a group of petty traitors and offered to a Japanese officer named Matsuoka Tameda Taro. More than a year later, that thing was transferred away, and he transferred the mother and daughter to an agent under his command; it was said to be Chinese, but it was actually a Korean. Until now, the mother and daughter were placed in the Tao, and he would come for a night when he was in a good mood; when he was not happy, his mansion had more than a dozen places, where he could squander at will.</p>
<p>Why didn't Cui He and her mother leave? According to Sister Cui, they had tried once or twice, but unfortunately the women were timid and weak, and their relatives had suffered the same fate, and they had nowhere to turn. They had many minions, and they were caught back after walking a few steps. After being caught back, they would be whipped and branded with a few hot irons. On their mother and daughter's legs and backs, they were branded with the words "Takada" and some "well" shaped checkered patterns. It is said that her cousin, who was hot-tempered, was forcibly injected with morphine to get her addicted; now she has become a dried-up person and is messing around in the barracks.</p>
<p>Sister Cui and her mother advised us not to go to the city, because once we went there, it would be difficult to come out in the original shape. They said that there was an even more terrifying devil's lair in the northeast of Shuangqiao and the northwest of Tong County, which was located at the intersection. Whether it was in Beiping or Tianjin, or in nearby towns and villages, all the kidnapped women were first sent there to be imprisoned until they became a prostitute, or a dried-up person, or a demon; otherwise, it would be a pile of ashes, if they had a strong temper. The kidnapped rich people, or the captured "resistance" members, were also sent there. If you wanted to escape with your life, unless you complied with the conditions, even if you had wings, I'm afraid you wouldn't be able to fly out.</p>
<p>According to the mother and daughter, although they had never been to that place, they knew that there was an airfield, a military camp, and a stockade, with soldiers stationed on all sides for several miles, and the defense was tightly guarded. Apart from the Japanese invaders, Koreans, Taiwanese, and Yin's henchmen, only one kind of person could enter—ordained monks—that was because the Japanese invaders and traitors had done too much evil, fearing divine retribution, so they often asked some monks to chant scriptures and recite Buddhist scriptures to repent for them.</p>
<p>When can we go to this devil's lair to explore, okay, little aunt? " Brother Hu asked me this when we left Sister Cui's house and walked on the road.</p>
<p>I also wanted to try, but I couldn't think of a safe way. There was also a difficult problem, that is, whether to go openly or secretly. According to the rules, we should report to the captain, and we can go if he allows it, otherwise we can't go. I told this to Brother Hu.</p>
<p>Brother Hu seemed quite reserved, and he was only twelve or thirteen years old, but you see that his forehead protrudes so much, and his back of the head is so big, no matter what, he is a cunning and mischievous character. When he heard me raise these two points, he had a lot of ideas; regarding the method of going, he said that he could ask Sister Cui and her mother to point out a hot temple, and we would pretend to be the monks staying in that temple. Regarding the captain's side, we can't report for the time being. He predicted that if we reported it, we would definitely not be able to go, and he would never let us take such a big risk. We can only go blindly. After we come back, we will say that we chased the thieves and went in, or that we were forced to go by the Japanese devils, and found a way to escape.</p>
<p>Although I agreed with this method at the time, I did not agree to go. I only told Brother Hu to let me think about it again. We walked all the way towards Tong County. Although we met a few cars carrying Japanese devils, traitors, and gangsters, we didn't let them see us. We had already left appropriately, so there was nothing along the way. We came here to report more than ten o'clock in the morning.</p>

<h3>Gazing at the Hut</h3>
<p>— Shao Fu</p>
<p>Turning hostility into friendship, these days they are talking about national affairs, these news are really the most important and happy thing for us ordinary people!</p>
<p>When the government's political consultative conference representatives, the Communist Party representatives, and the third-party people traveled back and forth for consultations these days, the location of their meeting was quite optimistic for us. For example, Wu Tiecheng's mansion is called "Wang Lu", which means there is hope; Zhang Junmai's residence is called "Fan Yuan", which means that the talks have a scope and there are norms to follow; Zhou Enlai's residence is on Sinan Road, which shows that although he is in Shanghai, his heart is thinking of Nanjing. Using place names to verify the current reality cannot be said to be a coincidence.</p>
<p>Victory has been a year, and we are still making emotional, stopping talks, and talking and stopping. It has been delayed for a year, letting people ridicule us and hurting ourselves in the end, but our own founding affairs have been delayed, which is extremely painful! Now, the laughter from Wang Lu, Fan Yuan, and Sinan Road will be the beginning of our ordinary people's collective laughter. May the above three places become immortal place names in our founding history.</p>

<h3>Who is the Judge</h3>
<p>— Translated by Chunliang</p>
<p>In the Chicago courthouse, there is a judge, a prosecutor, and a clerk. Their names are Robinson, Smith, and Jones; the list is out of order. There are three lawyers in court also named Robinson, Smith, and Jones.</p>
<p>We want to know what the judge's name is? Below are some of the messages we have found out. Can you find the answer from those messages?</p>
<p>(1) The clerk is the same name as the lawyer who lives in Chicago.</p>
<p>(2) The clerk earns three times as much income as his neighbor, one of the three lawyers.</p>
<p>(3) Smith (not a lawyer) once defeated the prosecutor in a croquet match.</p>
<p>(4) Mr. Robinson, one of the lawyers, lives in Barrington.</p>
<p>(5) The clerk earns $15,000 per year.</p>
<p>(6) The clerk lives between Chicago and Barrington.</p>
<p>(7) The lawyer, Mr. Jones, can make six thousand US dollars a year.</p>
<p>What is the judge's name?</p>
<p>(Note: Before looking at the answer, it is best to use your own brain first to test your wisdom!)</p>
<h3>Answer</h3>
<p>(A): A lawyer lives in Chicago (according to 1); a lawyer, Mr. Robinson, lives in Barrington, (according to 4); the clerk lives between Chicago and Barrington (according to 6), his neighbor is a lawyer, so that third lawyer, (either Smith or Jones) also lives between Chicago and Barrington.</p>
<p>(B): The clerk earns $15,000 per year (according to 5), which can also be said to be three times his lawyer neighbor's income (according to 2). Because lawyer Jones earns $6,000 per year, he cannot be that lawyer neighbor (according to 2). Therefore, he must live in Chicago or Barrington. But Mr. Robinson lives in Barrington (according to 4), so Jones must live in Chicago. (1) As a result, the remaining Mr. Smith is that neighbor.</p>
<p>(C): Because Mr. Jones lives in Chicago, the clerk's name must be Jones (according to 1).</p>
<p>(D): The prosecutor's name cannot be Smith, because Smith defeated him in a match (according to 3). Thus, the prosecutor's name must be Jones or Robinson, but, according to (C) above, he cannot be Jones, so he must be Robinson.</p>
<p>(E): Because, according to (C) above, the clerk's name is Jones, and according to (D) above, the prosecutor's name is Robinson, so the judge's name must be Smith.</p>
<p>The judge is Smith, right?</p>

<h3>A Youngster Is To Be Feared</h3>
<p>— Translated by Ge Chunliang, detailed from the October Reader's Digest</p>
<p>The Technique of Earning Money</p>
<p>As the car drove through the valley of Xiannan Ferry, we (a group of American soldiers) admired the beautiful scenery on a high hill. At first, I didn't pay any attention to a nearby stall because we had passed many such stalls. It wasn't until a twelve-year-old "little fellow" came over and lent us a pair of binoculars that we noticed. While pointing out the more interesting and beautiful scenery to us, he selected some of his fruits for us to eat. When we finished eating and asked him how much it cost, he quickly replied, "No need to pay, it's alright. These fruits are free. I like pointing out the scenery of this place to people, it's so beautiful—" As he spoke, he gazed at the bright valley.</p>
<p>Later, we decided to give him a silver quarter each. At the same time, I asked him, "Why are other stall owners selling their fruits, but you are giving them away for free?" He put the silver coins into his pocket, smiled slyly, and said, "Because I earn more than they do!"</p>
<p>"Those Who Labor with Their Minds Govern Others"</p>
<p>I (a housewife) wanted to level my patio to make a garden, but I was hesitant to ask my twelve-year-old son to do the work because the ground was full of rubble and stones, and the area was very large. "I'm willing to pay five US dollars to have someone level the patio," I said teasingly.</p>
<p>"Save the five dollars for me, Mom!" he requested, "This job can be done before tonight."</p>
<p>That afternoon, I heard a lot of shouting and laughter outside. About twenty boys were holding shovels, digging with all their might, and they all seemed very happy. "The garden will be finished in a few minutes," my son ran over and said to me. He looked very proud of himself, and I knew he hadn't even shoveled once. "How did you do it?" I asked.</p>
<p>"Oh! I just organized a competition. I divided the land into twenty small plots, and whoever digs the best and finishes the fastest will get a prize of one dollar. That way, I can earn four dollars. What do you say, Mom, where's the money?"</p>
<h3>Lying-Down Train</h3>
<p>— Chi Mo</p>
<p>Recently, a tragic "lying-down train" accident occurred at Jiashan Station on the Jiaxing railway.</p>
<p>This is not a natural disaster that cannot be resisted by human power. Seasoned travelers who frequently travel between Shanghai and Hangzhou must feel that the tracks near Jiashan Station may be low and sunken due to the corrosion and disrepair of the sleepers, causing the train to lose its balance and appear uneven, leaning left and right like a boat with the wind. Therefore, derailment is reasonable. Fortunately, it slowly lay down, and the lives of the passengers were not in as precarious a state as eggs in an overturned nest.</p>
<p>The tracks near Xin Zhuang Station are also the same. May the authorities take precautions to prevent problems before they occur, then the passengers are fortunate. Otherwise, the tragedy of the "lying-down train" will occur one after another.</p>
<h3>About Speaking</h3>
<p>— ww</p>
<p>The best speakers can make their words subtle and to the point, resolving disputes. Their words are often just right, leaving the other party feeling intrigued.</p>
<p>The next best are good at showing off, talking about one thing while meaning another, feigning indifference to catch the enemy, their words containing hidden meanings, not hitting the mark directly, making the other party unable to get angry, forcing a smile, and being helpless.</p>
<p>The worst are either ignorant or gossipy, exaggerating and distorting facts, making ridiculous connections. Open your mouth but don't move your hands, just laugh and don't get angry. Take it for what it's worth, whether it's gossiping or spreading rumors, the speaker has intentions, but the listener is not concerned.</p>
<p>Before the war, everyone felt that it was okay to "say don't speak," it didn't matter, you could say what you wanted. During the occupation, the people of Shanghai suddenly felt "don't speak." Someone kindly advised people: "Eat more and talk less!" But the enemy constitution punished him for eating more, and he died from it. After the victory, there were too many parties, making people feel like "to speak or not to speak?" Everyone talked about peace, but disasters continued to occur. Freedom of speech, despite being present, was just another saying, becoming a situation of talking to oneself.</p>
<p>Some people say, "When there is too much idle talk, people turn into pigs!" Others say, "Too much talk leads to mistakes," "Calamity comes from the mouth." Turning into a pig is a small matter. The arrival of disaster makes one tremble with fear. Looking at it this way, there is indeed a need to speak less.</p>
<p>A fool's words are often stubborn and unpleasant to hear, unlike those who know how to speak, who squint their eyes and, despite having honeyed words and a dagger in their heart, still sound eloquent and pleasing.</p>
<p>Friends, don't be discouraged! Words are trustworthy. As long as you speak the truth, even if a thousand fingers point at your forehead, and bones are stuck in your throat, you still have to spit it out!</p>
<h3>A Black Mother Gives Birth to Quadruplets</h3>
<h3>Talking About the Growth of Banknotes Amidst the Birth of Multi-Colored Currency</h3>
<p>— Jie Qing</p>
<p>According to reports, multi-colored banknotes will appear in our country, because the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) has transported a new American four-color printing press to our country. The machine can print colorful and dazzling banknotes in four colors at once. Undoubtedly, this will be an epoch-making reform in the history of our country's currency.</p>
<p>Taking this opportunity, I will briefly describe the evolution of our country's currency:</p>
<p>The earliest ancient coins used purely as a medium of exchange were called "ancient cloth," shaped like a shovel, and therefore also called "shovel cloth." The most reliable dating of the beginning of minting is the early Zhou Dynasty.</p>
<p>The coins popular in the early Zhou Dynasty included cloth, springs, round laws, and knives. The round coins with square holes that we see belong to the round law.</p>
<p>Jiang Taigong issued round laws in the early Zhou Dynasty, with the words "real goods" engraved on them. Later generations imitated this, so the word "treasure" is engraved on the coins of all dynasties in China.</p>
<p>As for the paper currency of our country, it has been in use for a long time. The Jiaozi and Huizi of the Song Dynasty, the Jiaochao of the Jin Dynasty, the Sichao of the Yuan Dynasty, and the Baochao of the Ming Dynasty were all banknotes in nature.</p>
<p>Overseas legends believe that the first monarch in the world to use banknotes as currency was Emperor Franz Joseph of Austria. When he first ordered the people to use banknotes, they seemed to think that the end of the world had arrived. They were used to seeing gold, silver, and jewels, and looked down on paper money. Therefore, the Austrian government issued a strict law that counterfeiters would be executed. Only then could banknotes circulate among the people.</p>
<p>The silver coins of our country initially consisted of foreign coins, with Spanish silver dollars being the earliest. They were brought to our country from the Philippines by the Spanish in the mid-16th century.</p>
<p>Following Spanish silver coins, Mexican "eagle coins" began to flow into our country in 1854 and became popular everywhere.</p>
<p>Our country began minting its own silver coins in the thirteenth year of Guangxu (1887 AD), called Dragon Dollars, which were first trial-minted in Guangdong Province.</p>
<p>Copper coins do not have a long history in China. It was not until after the Sino-Japanese War that the Qing government began to mint them in large quantities. Once copper coins appeared, cash was eliminated.</p>
<p>The Qing Dynasty minted about one hundred and several dozen types of copper coins. After the Republic of China, the various provinces and regions minted a total of about one hundred types of copper coins.</p>
<p>During the War of Resistance Against Japan, due to the lack of materials, it was necessary to use a one-paper-one-plate method, resulting in a large variety of banknotes circulating in the market, with different names. The printing was not precise, the paper was poor, and after being passed around, they became waste. Today, the War of Resistance has been won, and we should find ways to simplify them. It is hoped that inferior banknotes can be recovered as much as possible and replaced with beautiful, eye-catching, and colorful new banknotes.</p>

<h3>Three Abdications, Three Enthronements: King George II of Greece</h3>
<p>— Wen Zhen</p>
<p>There are many monarchs in history who have encountered hardships; but it is difficult to find an example like King George II of Greece. He abdicated and left the country three times, and returned to his country three times to become the head of state. Leaving the country was as common to him as a habit. In total, he spent twenty years abroad in hotels as an exile. Now he is fifty-six years old. The upcoming referendum in favor of a constitutional monarchy resulted in him returning to the country again. However, the Greek people in the south are easily moved and fickle, coupled with the instigation of the surrounding powers, its political situation is extremely unstable. Judging from the situation, George II may still be a puppet, and repeat the farce of abdicating and enthroning several times. On the one hand, we sigh for Greece, and at the same time, we can't help but mourn for our motherland, which is suffering from the same disease.</p>
<p>In 1917, the major powers of the Allied Powers used pressure to force George's father, Constantine, to abdicate. The throne was inherited by the latter's young son, Alexander, and the real power was entirely in the hands of Venizelos, who was trusted by the Allied Powers. As for Crown Prince George II, he was excluded by the Allied Powers because he had served for several years in a regiment of the Prussian Defense Forces as the nephew of the Kaiser. In fact, this reason does not constitute a reason for him to be pro-German. On the contrary, George II often told people that the experience of serving in the Prussian Defense Forces for several years made him quite disgusted with German soldiers.</p>
<p>His first enthronement was after his younger brother Alexander died suddenly and his father Constantine abdicated again. Unexpectedly, in less than two years, the Greeks again demanded democracy. This time he went to England.</p>
<p>A Simple Life</p>
<p>His second exile life was as simple as that of his ancestor, a Dane. One or two comfortable hotel rooms replaced the palace. He often went to second-hand bookstores to browse or buy his favorite history books. Sometimes we could meet him at the opening ceremony of an art gallery or theater. Occasionally, he would cross the English Channel to Paris to meet with his followers. At this time, he would spend the night at his uncle George's house.</p>
<p>A referendum in 1935 invited him back to his country again. This time, it was due to the efforts of the royalists that the referendum could be carried out smoothly. After ascending the throne, military power was in the hands of Metaxas. This General Metaxas, who had studied at the Prussian military academy, unexpectedly resolutely fought against the Axis powers in 1941, and thus King George's difficult life began again.</p>
<p>After all of mainland Greece was occupied, George and a few confidants wandered to the island of Crete south of Greece. In the last few days, under the pursuit of the Axis forces, he had to hide in the snowy mountains. Loyal villagers stealthily provided them with food and shelter, quenching their thirst with water melted from ice and snow, and hiding in frozen wooden houses at night. When he finally reached the coast and saw the British troops searching for him from afar, he waved a torch for six hours before the British troops discovered him and sent him to safety. After arriving in London, he immediately carried out his mission. Several Greek military and political units began to be established nearby, and the Greek navy also began to fight alongside the Allied navies. This time, it was not as shabby as his second exile. The headquarters was established in the Caridge Hotel. The luxurious London facilities were not much inferior to the palace in his home country; there were also many officers as his adjutants. However, the palace formalities could no longer be followed. In the restaurant, his table neighbors might be the King and Queen of Yugoslavia, or any wandering monarch, but they might also be ordinary travelers, not suspecting at all that George, wearing a tailored blue uniform, was not a naval officer on leave, but the monarch of Greece! But George was a monarch who did not adhere to customs, and none of this mattered to him.</p>
<p>Contribution to Anti-Axis</p>
<p>During this war, he had little free time. He had to go to the United States to defend his country, and also had to organize Greek soldiers and civilians to participate in the war against the Axis powers. This time, George II made indelible contributions to Greece's restoration.</p>
<p>This year, he had another disagreement with the ruling figures of Greece, and finally abdicated and left the country for the third time, until the recent referendum in favor of a constitutional monarchy.</p>
<p>What kind of evaluation should be made of George II? He is prudent, calm, has the perspective of an outsider, and has no ambition or desire to take on new responsibilities. This last point—an attitude of not competing with the world—is indeed a noble virtue, but it is also a sign of cowardice and incompetence. As a result, he can only abdicate and ascend the throne like a puppet, and cannot allow Greece itself to transcend the influence of the great powers.</p>
