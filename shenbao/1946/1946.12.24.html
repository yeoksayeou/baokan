<h3>憲草三讀今可完成　國大展至明日閉幕　主席對憲草提兩點指示</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿三日電〕茲悉憲草三讀會可望於廿四日下午舉行之十九次會中完成，故大會可於廿五日之歷史紀念日上午舉行閉幕。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿三日電〕國大主席國廿三日午十一時舉行第廿七次會議，蔣中正主席，決議事項如次：（一）憲法實施程序之準備草案，廿二日會巾決定爲十一條，廿三日會中復有第一二兩條之歸併，擬爲九條。（二）推定急法決議案整理小組委員名單，共訓十二人。（三）第十七次大會由孫科担任王席。下午六時主席團舉行第廿八次會，胡庶華主席，決議事項如决：（一）大會延期一日，至廿五日閉幕。（二）廿四日上下午開大會。（三）廿四日晨九時舉行第十八次大會，由孔祥熙担任主席。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿三日電〕蔣主席於廿三日之中樞紀念週上，對二讀會業已通過之憲法條文，有兩點提出，盼各代表慎重考慮。（一）第廿八次通過「現任官更不得當選爲國大代表」，認爲官吏本身之民權即被剝奪，希望各代表慎重老慮，再提出修正案。（二）第六十五條立法委員之名額分配問題，如照所通過之名額，將達七百餘人，召開會議，似有困難，亦希能慎重研究，聞若干代表亦早有此感，咸擬於日內提出修正案，重付討論，廿四日大會中可能有所決定。</p>
<p>〔中央社南京廿三日電〕中樞紀念週，廿三日晨八時半在國府大禮堂舉行，蔣主席親臨致訓，勗勉國民黨國大代表努力完成制憲任務。主席有稱：國大第二　會即將完竣，三讀之後，制憲工作即告完成，此次制憲爲歷史上最重大之任務，諸君此次參與此一偉大工作，乃最光榮之事。主席並稱：國大開幕迄今，將近四十日，本黨同志與各黨派代表相聚一堂，交換意見，共同討論，此種民主精神，得到甚大之成就，盼諸君今後保持此種精神，則本黨決不會失敗。主席　指出，憲草第六十五條規定，立法委員之名額當在七百人以上，人數實嫌太多，將來開會惠甚不易。又日昨二讓通過第廿八條，規定現任官吏不得當選爲國大代表，事實上恐亦有困難，最好能有所補救。主席繼贊稱：各代表對制憲工作皆能克盡職責，故有如此圓滿之結果，實爲本黨之成功。又稱：今國大即將閉幕，諸君亦將各還原地，盼各本在開會時之精神，繼續努力。此種精神，即在決議之前，公開討論，決議之後，則必須一政遵守是也，主席致讓歷半小時。</p>
<h3>憲草二讀迅速　今可全部完成　上午大會讀至一〇九條</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿三日電〕憲軍二讀進濟迅速，今日國大十六次會議中，上午計由八士三條讀至一〇九條。下午十七次大會中，由一一〇條讀至一三九條，除少數條款經修正外，其餘全部通過。預料廿四日十八次大會中，憲草二讀可全部告竣。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿三日電〕國民大會第十六次會議二十三日上午十時舉行，開會時出席代表一二四四人，後續增至一四七八人，谷正綱主席，報告員宣讀十五次會犧紀錄，後肯年黨謝代表澄平發言，要求會眾及主席注意議事規則，勿使一人臨時之主張影響會議進行。旋繼續二讀程序，自第七軍「司法」第八十三條開始討論，該條有朱代表嵩壽等三十四人提出修正案，主張維特原草案本條以下之順序及條文，俾可活用使大法官之職權除解釋憲法及統一解釋法令外，並得兼理審判，第四審委會之召集人江代表一平，乃發言解釋謂，大法官乃法學權威，並非最高法院法官，亦不應有過多之人數，其職權非限於第八十六條（新八十三條）之現定，兼理審判與否亦不必一定，宋代表樵述表示贊同，亦認爲大法官審判與吾不應作硬性之規定。經表決，贊成修正案者僅三一七票，仍以一〇二六票維特原文。第八十四條無異議通過。該條之後有陳代表長蘅等三十六人，提出補充案，擬增加一條爲「司法院關於所掌事項，得向立法院提出法律案」，陳氏說明理由後，陳代表啟天發言不贊成，謂不應由司法機關草制法律，而司法行政權依第八十二條　屬行政院，各級法院組織法亦不須司法院提出，且原草案精神乃以司法院爲最高之司法機關，與立法院對等獨立，如向立法院提出法律案，有改變此原則，使司法院對立法院負責之嫌，經表決，贊成補充案者僅二四五票，仍維持原案。第八十五條關於法官職務之保障，有代表就目前民間受害於腐化之司法機構之痛苦情形，提出申訴，主張對貪污之法官應有免除保障之規定，經表決後以一一〇九票維持原文，第八十六條無異議通過。但有倪代表弼發言，謂彼反對由司法院單獨解釋憲法，請求保留發言權，待討論至第一四九條時，再就此提出主張。第八十七絛無異議通過。第八章「考試」：第八十八至第九十四等七條，均無異犧通過，僅第九十條有卜代表文林等十八人提出修正案，以未足法定人數，卜氏亦放棄發言，未予討論。</p>
<p>第九章「監察」：第九十五條無異議通過。第九十六條關於監委之選舉名額掀起波濤，該條共有六修正案：（一）姚代表勤如等四十六人提，各省區監委名額分配應兼採人口比例制，主張第一項修改爲「各省市人口未滿五百萬人者五人，其人口超過五百萬以上者，每滿五百萬人，增選一人。」（二）趙代表炳琪等提，主張每省至少選監委五人。（三）貝代表再然等三十三人提，主張第一項應修改爲「每省五人至七人」。（四）傳代表斯年等三十七人提，以省區劃分後，每省五人之標準將使監院人數過多，工作必感困難，主張减少，將第一項修改爲「每省三人」。（五）王代表曉籟等三十五人提，主張將第二項修改爲」每直轄市五人」，（六）巴代表文峻等三十一人提，以蒙古除盟外尚有不隸屬於盟之獨立旗，主張將第三項修改爲「蒙古各盟（下加一字）旗共八叭」。修正案宣讀後，第四審委會召集人江代表一平說明監察權之對象係官吏，各省官吏名額相同，　委名額亦應相同。綜合審委會召築人陳代表啟天，繼說明該會決定五人之　準乃爲恰當之數目，且立院已依人口比例規定名額，監院應繼持各省之平衡。繼由主張修正之代表發言，倪代表彌方於棋　申述理由，樓下數代表己以討論與不討論之爭，發生爭吵，相互揮臂怒吼：「打！打！」一時秩序大亂。谷主席乃兩度急敲太譯，鎮壓會塲秩序，依議事規則宣布停止討論，於一部代表之反對聲中付諸表決，結果關於第一項，除第（二）趙代表等提案乃維持原案第（四）傅代表等提案巳自動撤回外，第（一）姚代表等提案僅獲四五七票。第（三）貝代表等提案僅獲三一二票均遭否決，第一項仍以一〇二六票之絕對多數維持原文。第二項第（五）王代表等提案，亦以一三一票之少數否決，維持原文。第三，第四項，綜合審委會召集人有書面聲明，謂「族」字係無意之疏漏。第（六）巴代表等之修正案乃無異議通過。全條文於第三項增訂一「旗」字後，以一二〇一票通過。至此十一時十分，休息後於十一時三十分續會，出席代表减至一二五〇人，第九十七條無異議通過。第九十八條有段代表炳麟等四十四人提修正案，主張將監察委員之任期减爲三年，以與立法委員之任期相符，經表決後獲四二八票，仍以七〇四票維持原文。第九九條無異議通過。該條以後有陳代表長蘅等三十五人提出補充案，擬增加一條爲「監察院關於其所掌事項得向立法院提出法律案」經表決後以四九〇票之少數否決。　　第一〇〇至第一〇六等七條無異議通過。第一〇七條有李代表詞總等三十六人，劉代表克　，樓代表桐蓀，陳代表顧遠等三十三人，及高代表一函等三十四人所提之三修正案，其內客相同，均擬將該條修正爲「監察委員除現行犯（下刪「及已受追訴者」六宇）外，非經監察院許可，不得逮捕或拘藥」。修正案宣　後，第四審委會召集人李代表中裏聲稱，第一〇七條監察委員受保障之規定，應與第七十九條立法委員者相同，族付表決，修正案獲九九四藥通過。第一〇八，一〇九，兩條無異議通過。時已十二時正，谷主　稱，主席團原定當日完成二　工作，擬延會半小時，當爲會眾拒絕，乃於洪秘書長報告下午三時開會後，宣告散會。</p>
<h3>行政院例會　改廿七舉行</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿三日電〕行政院會議，循例應於每星期二舉行，廿四日應舉行之例會，延至廿七日舉行，公務員加薪一事，又將延緩數日。</p>
<h3>努力完成民主憲法　司使盛讚蔣主席　盼我國人共挽經濟危機</h3>
<p>〔本報北平廿三日電〕司徒大使廿三日上午九時進城，訪問有關方面，午應美領事梅靈士宴，午後回校，四時廿分出席燕大師生大會並講演，五時牟與張東蓀晤談，司使尚未晤葉劉英，據有關方面息，司使將與葉會晤。</p>
<p>〔本報北平廿三日電〕司徒大使廿三日在燕大師生大會上，對蔣主席完成民主憲法之努力，深致識美，並籲請中國人民共同致力此憲法之實施。並謂目前物價高昂，民不聊生，中國之經淸已瀕於崩潰前夜，如不及時挽救，則前途實不堪設想，在此種情勢下，憂國之士，應該團結聯合，易破壞努力爲建設精神，從事新中國之建設，司使並談到中國的困雖，謂多半是人與人的關係不調諧，最後誠懇祝禱明年中國能够有重大的進步。</p>
<h3>主席邀馬使　共度聖誕夜</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿三日電〕馬歇爾特使，廿四日晚將應蔣主席夫婦之邀，於主席官邸度其聖誕夜。又育年黨中常委周謙冲，日前曾兩度訪馬特使，有所晤談，對目前局勢，亦交換意見。</p>
<p>〔中央社南京廿三日電〕美大使館發言人廿三日語記者，馬歇爾特使目前仍無離華計劃，所謂馬帥將於年前返國，絕不可靠。</p>
<h3>孫科胡適等十二人　整理憲草決議案　下午大會讀至一三九條</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿三日電〕國大第十七次大曾廿三日下午三時半舉行，出席一〇五〇人，孫科主席，行禮如儀後，除由秘書處宣讀第十六次會議紀錄外，並由洪秘醫長報告憲草決議案整理小組人選，共計十二人，名單如决：孫科·胡適·左舜生·陳啟天·王寵惠·王世杰·潘公展·林彬·蔣勻田·陳誠·洪蘭友。雷震。旋即開始繼續二讀會，計至第一一〇條起，至下午六時止討論至第一三九條止，全部通過，其中略有修正。茲誌其討論經過如次：第一一〇條其中第五款爲「航空國道國有鐵路國有公路及航政郵政電政」，凌鴻勛認爲國道即國有公路之謂，文字上有重複之嫌，應行修正，將「國有公路」四字取消，當經表決通過，其餘照修正案通過·第一一一條有薛培元之修正意見，認爲在此條第十二項後，加冽土地利用法一項，第十八項後加列物法一項，旋經表決佔少數，遭否決。又冷少泉等修正竟見，爲將此條第三項農林·工礦·商業改爲「森林·工礦·商業」，第六項航業及沿海漁業，改爲「航業及海洋漁　」，第十項二省以上水利及　道改爲「二省以上之水利河道　農牧聯法」，當經表決，以多數通過修正案。第一二一條冷少泉修正意見，將此條第六項「省農林·水利·畜牧·及工程」修政爲「省農林·水利·漁牧及工程」，經即通過。又第一二〇條後增列之一條，冷少泉修正意見將其中第五項改爲「縣農林，水利，漁牧及工程」，當經通過。其次自第一一三條至一二〇條，全部無異議通過，第一二〇條後加列兩條，其一爲「蒙古各盟族地力自治制度，以法律定之」，無異議通過。其二爲「西藏地方自治制度，應予以保障」。前經蔣主席宣佈，其中「地方」二字　除，當即通過。旋自第「一一一一」條起，縣之一節全部無異議通過。第十二章「選舉，罷免，創制，複決」，第「一二九」條「一三〇」條，照原文通過，第「一三一」條有秦聯奎修正意見，將隙條文「選舉應嚴藥威脅利誘，如有選舉訴訟，須交法院審判」，其中「須交」應改爲「由」。當由秦聯奎說明理由稱：訴諸係向法院提起，如稱「須交」，則係向其他機關提起，多此轉折後，多耗時間，同時訓政時期，選舉訴訟由法院審判，今突稱「須交」，頗似過去非由法院審判，將貽人誤會，如改爲「由」法院審判，則直捷明暸。當經表決多數通過，繼討論第「一三二」條，照原條文通過。　〔待續〕</p>

<h3>陈立夫部长答记者问　行憲日期尚待討論　各章性質不同或將分期實行</h3>
<p>〔</p>
<p>本報南京廿三日電〕中央組織部長陳立夫，廿三日午後於中宣部記者招待會中答覆問題時稱：中國國民黨爲一革命致黨，着重盡義務，而不重急　利，其性質與其他國家之政黨不同。總理當年曾舉伊尹輔贊太甲之鳴實爲例，今日情形真復與之相同。</p>
<p>國民黨精神　自由與紀律</p>
<p>國民黨旣爲一革命政黨，困之，凡對國家有利之事，其黨員即議牲生命爭之，亦所不惜，至多數服從少數，設少數意見果優於多數，多數日可採納，蓋國民黨之基本精神爲自由與紀律，未決定前，儘可自由討論，旣決定之後，則必須服從。此種精神，在此次國民大會中，可充分看到。惟多數服從少數之事，對民主政治究屬大有危險，偶一爲之尚可，一行再行，當將危及民主精神，古　云：「以六事小者，樂天者也，以小事大者，畏天者也」，實足爲目前情形說明。某記者詢以國大所通過之憲法，若爲求參加此次大會之黨派所反對，政府將採何種態度？陳答：此次所將制定之憲法，係全國國民代表所制定者，因之，此亦政府態度如何問題，而爲人民態度如何問題。</p>
<p>中共區選舉　須依憲進行</p>
<p>另一記者問，憲法通過後，中共問題如何解決，中共區內之代表，將如何選舉抑根本不需要中共區內代表？陳答：將來之選舉法，係以憲法爲根據，因之，任何地區皆須進行選舉，除非該黨不認其地區內之人民爲國民，渠認「任何黨派皆不應阻授憲法之施行」。某記者詢以「聞共產黨曾要末國大延期閉幕，此說確否？」並詢共產黨是否將參加，不參加有何影響？陳答：關於前一問題，渠並無所聞。關於後者，國大日內即閉幕，中共代表即來參加，恐亦不及趕到，除非乘火箭來此。並說明國大始終保留中共代表各額，彼等不參加，係自行棄權，對將來憲法實施，不致有何影響。陳氏認憲法可望於元且頒布，惟何時行憲，則尚待大會討論。蓋憲法因各章性質有異，恐須分期實行，而不能同時行使，如第三章國民大會，恐將先予實行。至國大代表之任期與任務問題，本屆國人任務雖以制憲爲主，然並不因制憲而與其他各屆國大不同，因之，其任期亦將似憲法所規定者，延至决屆國民大會開會之日。木屆國大閉幕後，國大代表制憲任務雖畢，然仍負宣傳與督促憲法如期實行之責。</p>
<p>國大閉幕後　將開黨務會</p>
<p>陳氏除答復上述問題外，尚談及國民黨將來之地位等問題，據稱：在憲法公布後，大總統選出前，國民政府仍有其法律地位，蓋其任務至移交竣事特始終了，此點，建國大綱中有明確規定，政府改組後，中央黨部各機構之地位與目前當有不同，惟須視政府如何改組而定。陳氏證實國大閉幕後，確將舉行一次黨務議會，然認此僅爲乘各地黨部負責人聚此之便，作一例行之黨務工作檢討，外傳將組識「黨政幹事會」之說，並無其事。關於明年度國民黨黨費如何籌措一問題陳答，自本年起，黨內若干事業，已逐漸緊縮，中央黨部人員裁去幾近半數，地方黨部人員亦多裁减，將來不製做到以黨員養黨，因之，渠認黨費問題不致有何困難。</p>

<h3>美報評論遠東局勢　英法荷遭遇困難　法太荏弱無法保持在越軍力</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社紐約廿二日電〕此間各農報本日紛紛評論遠東局勢，一致認爲英法荷三國均已遭遇困難，尤以法國所面臨者最爲困難。其中紐約泰晤士報載稱：僅有荷蘭一國成功，獲得相當程序之協調及荷印之安定，英國本身現正遭遇一嚴重考驗。但在法國對越南所採取之政策，在事實上不啻爲「戰亂不巳」者也。法國實太荏弱。無法保持其在越南所必需之軍力。以言中國國內困難情形，殊難樂觀，唯右蘇聯對此，容有愉快之理由。此外，紐約民聲講壇報亦戰稱：白人力能開發有色人種之亞洲之時代，即將過去，法荷兩國必須知之，以言法國，現正在非常嚴重之政治困難情形之下，艱苦奮鬥，對於其所當解決之徽妙問題，迄未能獲得長足進步。法國刻正設法以法蘭西聯邦之觀念代理法蘭西帝國，但越南對此種聯邦劇觀念，雅不欲予以接受，觀於英國首相艾德禮在下議院宣佈，對於緬甸應予以獨立。荷蘭眾議院亦贊成設立印度尼西亞聯邦，仍隸屬於荷蘭國王一項計劃，可知法國態度，實不能與英荷兩國相提並論云。</p>
<h3>越國民黨領袖　未與我方接觸</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社南京廿三日電〕關於越南國民黨領袖籌組「國民陣綫政府」並擬要求中美兩國調處越南糾紛一事，中國政府高級官員數人，今日均否認有所知悉。半官方面指出中國若與越南任何政治團體相接觸，將違反國府之政策，因政府希望法國依照本年二月間簽訂之中法條約，保護越南華僑之生命與財產。同時，外交部發言人今日向報界談稱：現在南京之越南國民黨任何領袖，並無向中國外交部接觸者。中國政府與越盟共和國並無外交關係，中國在該處之領事館，事實上僅與越盟當局接洽保護華僑事宜。我政府對於華僑之安全，大爲關切。中圻省會順化聞巳陷於越題舉隊之手當地一萬餘名華僑命還如何，尚朱接到報告。又今晨此間各報對於越南大批華僑之安全與中越邊界之和平與秩序，深表關切，力促法越當局制止衝突之擴大，恢復東南亞洲之和平與寗靜。</p>

<h3>安東與北鮮邊境安謐　中蘇間保持友好　水豐廠產權將提出洽商</h3>
<p>〔本報瀋陽廿二日電〕安東近漸成爲東北中。蘇軍政直接洽商事務地帶，頗爲人注目。廿一日記者在安東時，北鮮蘇軍當局尚有信致安東軍事當局，告以前平濟班機誤降平壞，已助飛返事，我方當覆信致謝。同時，蘇方前曾約雙方互相避免對方射擊，此事或即指在我軍初至安東時，對岸時向我方無目的開搶也。五十餘日來，雜方頗能保持友誼及安謐，惟近日蘇方似又有避免與我接觸太密切跡象，因我警備副司令渠愷擬赴鮮答訪，蘇方已婉拒，謂長官因病，有事可用書面通知，安東市現有鮮人一千七百五十人，因籍貫北鮮，無法遣送，同時尚時有夜間偷渡鴨緣江來往者，我曾捉獲數人，謂係不堪壓迫來此，實際情况不明，原傳共軍約二萬人由安東退入新義州，聞實際僅五六百人，多係共方行政人員。又關於要求在安東市東北百餘里我江岸拉古哨蘇軍十餘人撤離事，蘇方謂俟請示後再定，拉古哨爲水豐大堤所在地，安東市現由水豐每日供電三千基羅，近將增二千，惟係以糧米換來，聞我電力當局現在長春獲得前在民廿六年滿鮮所定水豐契約書，水豐廠產權滿鮮各半，有效期卅五年，我將根據此約，由外交當局與蘇洽商。</p>
<h3>大連蘇聯駐軍當局　拒絕美記者登岸　美艇寄碇逾限受警告</h3>

<h3>蘇州發生血案　傷兵與城防部隊衝突　因無票觀劇積嫌肇事</h3>
<p>〔本報蘇州廿三日電〕蘇州今日發生一大血案，係城防部隊與一零二後方醫院傷兵互毆而釀慘劇，雙方死傷均重，本報記者於出事當時，即馳赴衝突地帶調查眞相，茲分誌其詳情於後；</p>
<p>戲院槍聲　廿三日下午三時許，適值本邑北局各影戲院第一場將畢時，突自蘇州影戲院中傳出槍聲，瞬剎間，靑年會電影部與蘇州影戲院同時有傷兵數名，與負責糾察之青年軍士兵爭歐，未幾觀前警備區警備隊聞訊，由排長張宗海楊宏英率部十餘名，武裝趕至，惟傷兵已聚合約四五十名，羣情汹湧，無法彈壓。時首先參與爭歐之戲院糾察靑年軍士兵余綱黃雨州已受重傷踣地，警備幹部見狀，乃激憤不可抑，慘劇於焉開始，一時槍彈聯珠，行人竄避，北局一帶頓入戰爭狀態，經當地警察分所電告有關各方後，憲兵營長姚德培，城防部參謀長雷開喧，後方醫院院長鄭祖鎧，俱先後馳至。</p>
<p>死傷多名　其時雙方幹部仍僵持不下，傷兵以同伴被擊斃窟志鳴羅兆金張淸漢等四名之眾，並重傷莫有林一名，致羣情憤怒，誓死不退，姚德培營長遂緊急處置，允將警備隊排長張宗海楊宏英拘押以平眾忿，一面鄭祖鎧院長亦剴切曉論，勸令退歸，傷丘始整隊離塲，雷開喧參謀長爲防止意外，遂下戒嚴令，北局一帶咸斷絕交通，並將傷者送醫急救，且電報吳地檢處請派員檢驗屍體。其時忽復據報靑年軍傳達兵焦華念一名，在察院塲口與傷兵數名遭遇，被歐受重傷，且另有二名失蹤，被奪，遺失大步槍八支湯姆搶二枝等情，雷鄭兩氏遂互實人命令，分別禁止部屬出外，同時並查得大光明影戲院門前水菓攤主陳祖二爲流彈擊巾右腰，傷勢危殆，乃亦飭送博宏醫院診治。</p>
<p>集議善後　各方面佈置妥貼後，姚營長遂邀雷陳兩氏於北局憲兵隊集議善後辦法，當決定（一）屍體厚爲營葬，從優撫鄭遣族。（二）今後糾察工作，憲軍聯合維持。（三）責任問題，呈報上峯靜候處理等數端。本報記者及分訪三氏，就肇事原因有所探詢，首由雷開暄參謀長答稱：本部負責城防，對無票看戲之軍人禁止極嚴，意在體恤商艱，致半月餘來與傷兵積嫌頗多，加之廿一日有傷兵二名，强欲無票看戲。被稽查隊扣留後，電告傷兵醫院領去管束，導火綫即在於此。當未肇事前，本部曾據報悉其將有計劃作大搗亂，故早命令各糾察兵勿再干涉，以冀緩和，乃不幸慘劇仍慶爆發，惟據各方報告，傷兵確懷有槍械，並憑擁奪械，先擊傷本部士兵，並於肇禍之一小時後，皮市街方面亦發現槍聲，絕非靑年軍部隊所爲，況蘇州傷兵總數達千餘人，觀今日聲勢，出動人員的在二百人左右。次由鄭祖鎧院長告稱：管理傷兵素極困難，良以彼等效忠國家，目前生活艱窘，致影響情感趨於暴躁，前日靑年軍將二傷兵組長拘留，實爲促成此次慘劇主因，本人曾預有風聞，故今日二時後，親至各戲院察看，勸令觀劇傷兵回院，因見情況平靜，故先折歸，乃中途聞警趕至，僅見傷兵約四五十人，現已全部歸去，至懷搶奪械諸端，以本人殺想，傷兵決難有此舉動。繼由姚德培營長告稱：慘劇事起倉猝，憲兵不及遏止，誠屬遣憾，幸現已平息，維持治安絕無問題，堪請社會安心，至所拘排長二名，當解城防部自行訊辦。</p>
<p>戒嚴狀態　末則雷參謀長聲靑年軍師部副官主任鄭忱均表示，將以全力維護蘇州治安。記者曾詢以戒嚴令何時撤消，據告俟檢騐完畢入殮後，即恢復交通，六時許地院派檢察官陳疇率檢騐史宣芳蒞塲，騐得偽兵四名俱係槍傷，當命先行掩埋。北局一至十時許尚在戒嚴狀態中，因城防指揮官曹永湘少將適因公他往，故善後究馬如何，尚難決定也。</p>
<h3>萬寶山事件六主犯　郝永德等調查終結　長春地檢處提公訴</h3>
<p>〔中央社長春廿三二日電〕「九一八」事變之序幕萬寶山事件主犯郝永德等六人，本年六月被長春警備司令部檢舉，解交長春地檢處後，現已調查終結，被告郝永德等對組織長農稻田公司，拘捕韓人，依仗日本勢力，欺壓地主孫永淸等事實，均供認不諱，已由地檢處向長春地院提起公訴。該案內容，爲被告郝永德於民國廿年三月，賄通己故長春縣長馬以援，組織長農稻田公司，由被告曾彥士作保，承租長春縣屬馬家哨口一帶，土地五百餘畝，轉租於韓人種稻，因被告邊相仁·李造和·柳龍化及林鎮泰等曾引同韓人百八十八名，在該處掘溝引水。致引起七月一日當地人民與韓人間之爭執，當時我方曾根據一九〇九年九月四日「不准韓人住居及租地」之間島協約，與日本交涉，但日方不顯協約，派警保護韓人掘溝，並向我民眾開槍，同時日本並擴大宣傳，致釀成朝鮮境內之排華慘案，後該地引水溝，卒在日警之保護下掘成，該事件直至「九一八」事件時猶未解決。</p>

<h3>社論　關心越南的局勢</h3>
<p>我們很關心最近在越南的發展。截至寫稿時爲止，從越南來的，以及關於越南局勢的消息，相當含混。我們所曉得的僅是武裝衝突正在越南北部各處進行着，流血事件尚未終止。但同時據我們另一家同業的報道則謂法政府己令越南法軍向維明政府投降，以免法人在越的遭受大屠殺。與此消息相反的，却有路透社的報道謂駐突尼西亞的法軍第二十五傘兵師，業己奉令增援越南的法防軍。關於武裝衝突的情形，聞己蔓延及於河內北圻乃至南圻全境，法越雙方，頗多死傷。現在越南的情勢，究屬如何，目下尚難判明；惟據法方所傳出來的消息，則謂河內東京一帶的衝突，已漸告肅淸。但此是否爲局勢的眞實發展，我們此際似亦頗難遽下斷語。</p>
<p>在這個時候，值得我們注意的有三方面的報道：（一）據法國新聞社突尼斯二十一日電越南長官海軍中將特阿琴留過此飛往越南，對新聞記者談稱，對最近在越南發生的事件，適值渠離越期內，深爲抱歉；以是渠所知關於越南局勢的報道，實甚有限；（二）法殖民部長莫台德頃離法赴越，調查法越衝突事件，將來南京，「謁見蔣主席作禮儀的拜訪，並擬請中國忠實遵守諾言，在越南衝突中嚴守中立。」（三）越南國民黨領袖即越盟共和國政府前任外交部長葛英桐丹，據法國新聞社的報道，謂現在南京，曾向該社記者談稱，越南「國民陣錢政府」業己組成，在適當時機，即可宣佈新政府之所在，據該社記者推測，大抵可能即在南京。其所訂的四大政綱爲：（一）由中美兩國出面調處，以便對法展開談判，並保證將來所可成立之任何協定，立即付諸實施；（二）越盟必須在越南聯邦與法國聯邦機構內成爲名符其實的自由邦，其領土包括越南三圻；（三）越盟在越南聯邦參政會中，必須有適當比例的代表；參政會主席爲法人，但其權力，一如英國駐澳洲專員之類；（四）法軍得在越盟境內佔有若干特定之地點，但必須在五年內自各該地撤退，越盟境內法國人全部經濟與文化利益，當由越盟政府忠實保證。</p>
<p>從上面這一段，我們可以曉得法國駐越南的長官對於此次越南的動亂，所知甚少；此雖或爲一番官腔，但其本身無可非議。法國新聞社對於越南國民黨領袖的報道，是否別有作用，我們在所不知；不過就其所發布的所謂越南「國民陣綫政府」的四大政綱，我們所感覺到詫異的倒是他們所抱態度的溫和。今天印度要求獨立，緬甸要求獨立，就是荷印也要求獨立；而越南却能自滿於一個多少相等於大英帝國內「道米寗」，即所謂自治領的地位，似乎頗費人的思索。說越南人民沒有民族的覺醒吧，則有多少志士爲了他們的祖國捨身成仁·又有多少被越南的法國當局放逐到疫瘴畢集的蠻荒地帶，如南美洲的魔島以及太平洋上的荒島，爲了越南。他們祖國的正氣，不惜忍辱以死。如果越南的民族主義者了然於當今國際政治局勢的現實環境，故而不爲理想深遠的要求，則我們所不解的，爲何開明的第四法蘭西共和國的政府，對於這些溫和的要求，不加採納，反而要鬧出流血的事件來。</p>
<p>但是使我們有不能不一言的，倒是關於法國殖民部長的東來。這位部長的東來是爲了調查法越衝突事件，又將來華，「謁見蔣主席作禮儀的拜訪，」並「擬請中國遵守諾言，在越南衝突嚴守中立。」我們不欲問這報道的眞實性如何；我們於此所不能不聲朋的，就是無論政府的態度如何，中國人民在越南衝突中所抱的態度是無所謂中立的，我們不諱言我們的同情何在。對於越南事件我政府的態度如何，我政府自有權衡決定，我們於此不欲多言。但中國人民與越南人民情同手足，對於他們的福利，我們自然至爲關切。過去幾十年來越南人民的遭遇，我們彷彿身受；所以對於越南人民的民族願望，中國人民最爲了解，而寄予莫大的同情。所以對於法軍此次思以武力來擊潰越南人民的民族運動，爲了法國本身着想，我們也實在覺得扼腕。</p>
<p>紐約民聲講壇報在論到法國在遠東政策的時候，曾謂：「白人力能開發有色人種之亞洲之時代，即將過去；法國必須知之；以言法國，現正在非常嚴重之政治困難情形之下，艱苦奮鬥，對於其所當解決之微妙問題，迄未能獲得長足進步。法國刻正設法以法蘭西聯邦之觀念代替法蘭西帝國，但越南對於此種聯邦觀念，雅不欲予以接受，觀於英國首相艾德禮在下議院宣布，對於緬甸應予以獨立，荷蘭眾議院亦贊成設立印度尼四亞聯邦，仍屬於荷蘭國王一項計劃，可知法國態皮，實不能與英荷兩國相提並論。」這的確是公正的論斷。如果越南問題得不到適當的解決。必將貽遠東的和平以後患。所以我們此際一面要促法國政府善自處理越南問題，否則越南局勢與國際大局有關，關心世界和平的各民族也不能讓此種局勢長此遷延下去。</p>

<p>〔本報濟南訊〕魯省居黃河下游，宿稱險工，西北各縣自濟陽以下迄利津縣入海，爲黃河尾　，險工允多，自中牟決口之後，魯省一段黃河徒個虛名，河水幾至涸竭，勝利以還，黃河水利委員會以從事堵口復堤工作，惟因自濟陽以迄尾閭，係共軍之「解放區」，所修復之堤身　爲鬆薄，且尾閭亦未經浚疏，魯西北各縣旅濟同鄉會因花園口門一旦堵築合龍，黃永回復故　，大溜東來，深恐引致危險，曾向省參議會請願，要求在河身堤防未挖修完整，尾問未暢通以前，暫緩堵塞中牟決口，山東省各縣旅濟同鄉會聯合會，復徇民眾之要求，再電中央請願，顧惜下游數十縣人民生命財產，在復堤工程未完固前，暫緩堵合決口，並擬個請願畫，準備向有關各方及黃河堵口復堤工程局，暨黃委會視察人員到濟時請願，其請顯書略謂：黃河故道，山東下游各堤防，經戰事期間之破壞，極爲殘破，自濟陽至利津間之挖河修堤工程，由所謂解放區征工辦理，堤身極爲鬆薄，河床淤塞之處，挑挖亦極窄狹，且兩岸直立，形勢雖爲美觀，用作黃河水道，容易搜根坍塌，一旦放水東來，大溜冲刷，不久即可發生危險，此等草率工事，以作防禦工事或可有效，以之抵禦奔騰汹湧之黃溜，恐無把握，員有引致危險，淹沒下游數十縣數百萬人民生命財產之虞。再治河之言，疏通尾閭最爲重要，尾閭宣洩不暢，無論河身如何寬大，難容淵源萬里之黃水，自淸咸豐五年黃河改道，由鐵門關入海之後，至戰前河口遷移十餘次，均因口門鐵板沙淤　塞，水流不暢，河身易致漫海，常有潰決之害，河口隨時必自然改道，漫流入海，河口以上二三百里間無正式河口，任其漫流，亦無堤防，束水冲沙，此次黃河復員，對所謂解放區挖河修堤工程，旣極草率，對於疏通尾閭之主要工程更未注意，花國一旦堵口合龍，非僅卞游兩岸易出危險，且河口淤塞，允易使全河發生意外，魯北及西南各縣靠近黃河，利害關係較切，面臨重大危險，不能不言，爲預防將來危險計，爲數百萬人民生命財產安全計，特聯合請願，請轉呈中央　憐數十縣人民：（一）暫緩堵塞花園園口門。（二）自濟陽至利津間之河身堤防，另行切實挖修。（三）尾閭兩旁建築堅固堤防，直達海岸，束水刷沙，口門挑挖寬大。（四）澦置挖泥船十艘，以備放水後，常年在河身河口拖挖淤壑，一勞永逸。以上四項辦理完竣後，再將花園口門堵塞合龍云云·</p>

<h3>小學課本在改善</h3>
<p>本　前刊載余靜芬君一小學課本急待改善」一文，頃由國立編譯館來函陳述：（一）紙張惡劣印刷模糊查現行部編小學教科書，曾由教育部規定紙張及印刷各項條件，務期淸晰，免損兒童目力。上海七聯處亦注意及此故各書版權頁右下角列有承印書局之名；如「商務」「中華」「正中」等以資識別而示負責。除已將封面改用厚紙印刷力求精良二點轉知七家聯合供應處再行改進外，甚盼各校於採用時，先將各書局所印者比較紙張印刷而予選購，促使各書局自行競爭，力事改進。（二）錯字太多版本不同查上海供應之小學課本，在上年秋季及本年春季，爲抗戰期內之標準本，在本年秋季供應之晉，應爲勝利後修訂標準本，抗戰教材，多已刪換爲建國教材，各校選購應注意封面上印有「修訂標準本」字樣之小學課本，以免買舊版本。此决修訂標準本，係署期在滬趕採，時間迫促，手民誤排失校之處不少，除已先在申報登數勘誤外，並已專印勘誤表呈部分發各省市教育應局轉發各校自行更正，以免貽誤。一面經己通知七聯處修改紙型，務期下屆所印之書，不再錯誤。（三）內容陳舊查部編教科書，前後五年，正在世界大戰時期，國內外情勢變動甚多，故初小國常，五年內已修訂四次，大致已能適應時代。部編教科書經常修訂，教材常新，此爲其　點之一。惟地理教材，情形不同，其修訂必須俟有確定資料，方可着手，故雖迭奉教育部令飭修訂，已將原書局部修正，尚未發交改排付印。即如余君所述東北劃分九省一點，迄今雖有九省名稱，但九省省界轄縣面積人口，均未確定。（各報所載東九省劃分情形，均非正式公報，教科書必須俟中央公布後才能編入）無法編入，本館經常與內政部取得聯　，然截至最近，（內政部公函仍稱：「關於東北各省省界，現本部擬具修正東北新省區方案呈核一俟核定即公布」等語，是此點之修正，尚須稍待時日，此外如外蒙古之界綫，歐洲各國之疆界，非洲及太平洋烏嶼之管轄等，均未決定，祇可暫緩修訂。凡此時事改變，深盼各校教師於教學時臨時補充，以補教材之不足。以上各點，關心者想不止余君一人，請　予發展，以告教育界諸君。</p>

<h3>貝文發表廣播演說　强調世界持久和平</h3>
<p>謂中國以其悠久歷史必能統一　英國居美蘇之間具有積極力量</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社倫教廿二日電〕英國外相貝文今晚發表廣播演說，力曾其本人深信中國必能統一，以其悠久之哲學與經驗，對於世界復典，必能有莫大之貢獻。其言有曰：余相信吾人在列強之間，樹立協調與和諧，業已進入第一階段，然則其故安在？第一，吾人對於第一批和平條約，即對義·羅·匈·保·芬五國之和約，業已獲致協議。第二，吾人刻正形成一個機構，使聯合各國對於其相互閒之關係，以及維持和平得以有所遵循。吾人雖已獲得勝利，但其所耗代價甚爲鉅大，人力物力損失慘重，實難估計。惟吾人現已明暸舊國際聯盟之缺點，且已組織聯合國機稱取其地位而成立，此乃戰後足以令人愉快之事。聯合國機構雖尚未臻完善之境，但今後當逐步加以改善。就英國本身而言，吾人已決意以聯合國之決議爲基礎，而樹立吾人日後與世界各國之關係。現行政策之主要條件有三：其一即使各國之軍備成爲不必要；其二即達到一種和平之狀態，使人類思想轉向經濟的及文化的發展；其三即使各國均得享用世上所有之天然資源。</p>
<p>以言特里埃斯特自由問題，特區乃拉丁民族與斯拉夫民族會合之處，五口人已儘極大可能，務使在斯拉夫人統治下之義大利人儘量减少。反之，斯拉夫人之在美國統治下者，亦使其减少，國際區域之設立，當可產生一會合地點。</p>
<p>至以德國問題而論，吾人將在德國造成某種情形，俾使德國人民恢復其原有之自尊心。但德國人民須知，此種情形之產生，實需相當時日。德國國內情形，因受希特勒統治之影饗，欲使其恢復正常，恐非數十年不可。四國外長下屆會議，現已定於來年三月廿日在莫斯科舉行，屆時德國及奧地利之將來，當可加以討論。</p>
<p>以言經濟制度，各國固然各不相同，例如美國乃爲自由企業之國家，蘇聯則已發展一種不同之經濟制度，不幸遭德國侵略，蒙受可怖之損失，致使其十月革命以來所獲致之偉大成就，幾乎完全化爲烏有。至於法國，三度遭遇侵略，仍能在世界各國之前，發揮其永久之自由原則，殊足稱道。</p>
<p>以言中國抗戰最久，甚至今日國內仍內爭不止，殊堪扼腕。但中國必能統一，悠久之哲學與經騐對於世界復興必能有莫大之貢獻，殆無疑義。美蘇兩國已因第二次世界大戰而佔優勢。至於英國，則適居其中。凡此種種發展，均足以證明英國在大戰結束之後所採取之政策，具有積極之力量。若干方面曾指斥英國與美國關係過分寗切，而與蘇聯之關係則不十分密切，可能招致第三次世界大戰。此種論調，汝等諒已有所聞及。實則英國初未使其本身受任何國家之的束，英國竭誠願意向世界各國伸出友誼與合作之手。余相信蘇聯已充分瞭解，世界各國均準備與英合作，並願見蘇聯依照其本身之方法發展其制度。吾人目下匪特爲現代人民締造和平，抑且爲下代締造和平，故必須緩緩進行，務使其臻於完善，深望全國人民忍耐母躁云。</p>
<h3>杜魯門聖誕祝辭　願國人繼續努力奮鬬　使世界民族共享和平</h3>
<p>〔美國新聞處華盛頓廿二日電〕杜魯門總統向全世田美軍武裝部隊發表聖誕節祝辭如下：「余乘此機會向諸位慶賀聖誕佳節，殊感欣慰，吾人現正從事於一次偉大之奮鬥，務使今日與明日之世界，形成各國各民族公正永久和平。欲完成吾人之任務，需要我武裝部隊不分男女，具有同樣之貢獻與同樣崇高之理想，一如諸位往常所表現者。全世界愛好和平之人民在已往黑暗之時期，曾爲戰爭之勝利而祈禱，今則爲地球上之和諧與安謐而祈禱，彼等之祈禱必能成功。余願表達國家對於諸位所扮角色之深切感激，並希吾人之感激，能聊以補償諸位離鄉背井在外國度此聖誕節之遺憾。願諸位均有快樂之即誕節。」</p>
<p>旨在防止戰爭　非從事新戰爭</p>
<p>同時，陸長柏德遜及參謀總長艾森豪威爾亦致電全球各地美軍，內容如次：柏德遜電稱：「值茲聖誕節日，余談此向全球各地軍事及軍屬男女人員，表示衷誠賀忱及致意，並對諸位一年來忠於職守之服務申謝。此係艱苦之一年，但諸位已光榮的完成此項艱巨工作，諸位已表現軍人之英勇，睿智與堅守崗位之氣質，使爾等在戰塲揚威，並獲得贊許與敬佩。諸位在國內外之工作，仍秉承最優良之軍人傳統。」</p>
<p>艾帥電稱：「諸位均爲軍人，諸位均從事某種使命，從事建立並維護某種情形以發揚聖誕精神，俾其廣被全世界。無論諸位駐留何地及從事何種工作，諸位均爲和平之維護者，以是，由於諸位之勞力，吾人於本屆及今後之聖誕節始能盡情慶祝，得免戰爭之恐怖。過去之成就，雖顯示諸位必須在技術，軍紀，及精神上臻於完美，惟諸位之基本目標當在於防止戰爭，而非從事戰爭。余謹此向隸屬於本國軍隊中之人員表示衷誠之賀忱與致意。</p>

<p>〔中央社柏林廿二日合眾電〕此間英當局宣稱，英蘇兩國已簽訂一協定，開放兩國在德佔領區之貿易，美佔領區將自動參加。此協定之有效期聞，爲一九四七年之春季。英當局並特別聲明稱，美當局雖未參與簽字，但曾協助完成此項協定，並加以認可。此項協定係以本年度最後四個月有效之協定爲藍本，僅有少數條款，規定以物易物之貿易，使德人初次獲得機會，以談判佔領砥將來貿易協定之基礎，根據協定中規定英美佔領區將運送十三萬噸鋼鐵，一萬五千套車胎，及五百匹馬至蘇佔領區，蘇將向英美佔領區織出四萬二千噸馬鈴薯，三萬四千噸小麥及九千噸糖。</p>

<p>〔英國新聞處倫敦廿三日電〕新聞記事報科學編輯撰文稱：「中國女科學家一人，某晚在巴黎法蘭西大學居里教」授實驗室內工作，發現鈾之新分裂，引起原子物理學者之密切注意。伊在顯微鏡下審視一照相版，即發現原子新現象，即鈾原子分裂爲四部，以代替原有之分裂爲二部。迄今爲止，在原子彈之研究方面咸公認爲兩部分裂。此項新發現之意義，仍在推進中，然已爲從事研究之科學界人士闢一新途徑。此次發現爲鮑衛爾博士在布里斯托爾大學製成照相版，用以透露原子分子之形狀。何慈豐女士之夫錢山强博士（錢玄同之子）爲從事「四部分裂」之發現，曾以一月之時間在布里斯托爾研究技術。錢博士返抵巴黎後運用富於銀質之特製照相版。彼將照相版塗以鈾鹽，並使以原子分子之中性電子之爆炸，彼在高倍之顯微鏡下，發現在照相版左面爲中性電子所分裂之碎片中有所形跡。錢博士稱：十一月二十二日晚上，余妻發現一照相版頗有不同之處。置於顯微鏡下乃發現來自一點上之黑綫四條。其　中二綫較長，二綫較短。次日即將比等黑綫予以證實。經審慎研討後，全等極表滿意，蓋此四分子所投之性能，實等於一萬萬瓦特。」</p>
<h3>教宗籲請世界教民　奮起組織神聖同盟　抵抗義大利反宗教潮流</h3>
<p>〔聯合社梵蒂岡廿二日電〕教宗庇護十二世今日向聖彼得堂廣塲數萬虔誠教徒發表演說，主張世界各國基督教徒應組成神聖同盟，以克服世界上之仇視。此次盛大集會，係由教會號召，向教宗表示敬意，以抵抗義大利反宗教潮流。教宗蒞塲時，羣眾歡聲雷動，歷時十分鐘始止，當教宗宣稱，今日之戰係爲「擁護基督而戰，抑爲反對基督面戰」，羣眾大聲應之曰，「爲擁護基督而戰」。</p>
<h3>戰後第二屆聖誕獻辭：但願和平普天下</h3>
<p>根據聯合社的報告，在受過戰爭洗禮的世界上，至少尚有十國在流血……</p>
<p>〔聯合社倫敦廿二日電〕二十世紀第二次世界大戰後的第二屆耶穌聖誕，地上的和平仍舊是一個未實現的理想。即使聯合國機構努力向着持久的和平前進，但據聯合通訊社的報導，至少尚有十國在流血。伊朗政府軍與蘇聯支持的亞賽爾拜然省自治軍的戰事停止了還沒有多時。下面是歐洲和近東各國的近況：</p>
<p>希臘　希臘北部事實上內戰仍在進行。遊擊隊，政府方面指他們是共產黨，一股一股的襲擊，每股的人數從一百到一千不等，他們的兵器有迫擊砲，有重機關槍，有自動步槍。他們攻擊山區的憲兵隊和哨兵崗位和村莊，政府軍也向他們還擊。共產黨報紙稱這運動爲「抵抗君主法西斯」，完全出於國人的自發，與外國無涉。希臘政府，與英國關係最密切，則說這些股匪係從保加利亞，南斯拉夫和阿爾巴尼亞，獲得接濟和指使，可是保加利亞，南斯拉夫和阿爾巴尼亞矢口不承認。</p>
<p>波蘭　波蘭臨時政府傾向蘇聯，仍有地下軍想把它推翻，國內戰爭時斷時續。此外還有烏克蘭民族主義派不時夜襲，政府方面加以應付·波蘭兩個最大的反政府地下組織，一個是「民族武裝部隊」，一個是「自由和獨立軍」，他們的實力約自一萬五千人到十萬人。他們曾經宣布過他們的目的在於採用破壞，搶卻，武力攻擊政府機關，暗殺政府官員和蘇聯軍人，以推翻現政府。據波蘭官方宣布，一年之中，被殺的官員有八千餘名。自解放以來，波蘭政府軍死傷的人數約近四千人。地下組織方面死傷的人數要大得多。地下部隊大多以森林爲他們出沒的塲所。至於烏克蘭人呢，見因爲波蘭曾於去年與蘇聯訂立協定，規定將波蘭境內烏克蘭人四十三萬四千人遷往蘇聯，空出來的地方則由波蘭人居住，因而引起烏克蘭人的反對。當時曾有烏克蘭人約二千名騎着馬和機動車黑夜侵入波蘭燒殺搶劫無所不爲，致使桑河一帶的波蘭人十四萬一千人無家可歸。</p>
<p>巴基斯坦　英國駐軍與猶太人和阿刺伯人的衝突不息，巳使巴勒斯坦成爲騷擾區域，今年有三十五萬人以上被殺，房產損失估計達一千萬美元以上。猶太人大抵想設立猶太老家。阿刺伯人大抵想設立獨立國，享受大多數之權利。英國又想保持和平，維持宅在東地中海的軍略前哨站。猶太人不管移民限制，企圖進入巴勒斯坦，與軍隊發生衝突。猶太秘密恐怖團髓在公路埋地雷，襲擊汽車，炸毀公共建築物，使英軍受困。</p>
<p>埃及　國家主義派示威，反對英軍繼續留駐埃及。學生與其他示威者對軍警發生零星衝突。今春的示威運動，引起對英軍的衝突，並推翻一個政府。同時，警察局和英軍的酒排間和菜館中，被投擲手榴彈。埃及軍隊員額佔計在六萬至八萬之間。英國駐埃及的軍隊，遠較此數爲大。英軍同意在一九四七年三月以前，自蘇彝士運河區撤退，依照一九三六年英埃同盟條約，英國或可在埃及留駐有限的軍力至一九五六年，但依照未決的新提案，英軍當在一九四九年九月一日以前，全部自埃及撤退。</p>
<h3>尼赫魯擬組織　亞洲民族聯盟</h3>
<p>〔中央社倫敦廿二日電〕據星期觀察報稱：印臨時政府副主席尼赫魯，刻正考慮組織亞洲民族聯盟之計劃，渠並代表印臨時政府，邀請亞州十二獨立國家及其他委託統治地與屬地之十八政府及代表國體，參與該會，此諸國家中，包括中國，朝鮮，馬來亞，越南政府，印尼共和國政府，巴勒斯坦阿刺伯及猶太代表。</p>
<h3>雙喜臨門</h3>
<p>新娘初自英國來　產下一女又三男</p>
<p>〔聯合社馬利關州巴的摩爾廿二日電〕海安夫人今日產生一胎四兒，三男一女，醫生稱四兒髖格完達。體重自六，四五磅至七，四磅不等。海夫人爲來自英國之戰時新娘。其丈夫爲廿八歲之釘書匠。夫婦年前已育一兒。</p>
<h3>擴大雷達應用　蘇聯捕魚新法</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社莫斯科廿二日電〕蘇聯現正採取各項步驟，改善捕魚方法。蘇聯之捕魚隊將裝置極強烈之聲音設備，探測魚羣，此種設備包括雷達電波在內。因蘇聯漁船曾利用雷達發現大批靑魚，因而擴大其應用。</p>

<h3>侵佔敵產　清查團移送要案之一　汪柱臣初度提審　所供與警備部處長來信不符　連推事將親自勘查搜集證據</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕汪柱臣侵佔敵長島洋行汽車材料嫌疑案，自清查團移送地檢處偵查終結後，於上月廿一日依侵佔罪提起公訴。昨日下午二時，由地院連震邦推事初次審理，首提被告汪柱臣。汪衣黑大衣，深灰洋裝，身體魁梧，態度鎮靜。連推事僅詢過年齡，籍貫即　押下。繼傳告發人武天祥，　棟林二人。武稱於戰前即在北海甯路二號開設中美祥記汽車公司，抗戰軍興舉家遷避。北海甯路二號旋爲敵長島洋行佔用，仍設汽車廠。勝利歸來，該處房屋已爲汪柱臣接收，經武向敵偽產業處理局，警察局等處交涉，已准予發還，唯汪始終未肯交還，因悉其積極偷運長島洋行遺下之汽車另件，故向清查團告密，並要求發還房屋。武述畢，再傳證人中央機器廠范蓉春，因中央機器廠曾有收賊汪偷運汽車材料之嫌疑。范稱並不識汪，該批寄存汽車另件係者陀路警察分局副分局長　永溪來電話囑暫寄存，當時不知來源後因職員願定一，於八月十三日見報，悉汪柱臣侵佔案發，乃知該批貨物與汪案有關。唯恐牽連受累，故即報告憲　查點封存，至今仍在原處，且有人看守。其他皆不知情。再傳證人張佩純。張供稱：原係汪之職員，唯已於七月初旬辭職，另在川公路創立鐘聲修理廠。該廠房屋亦爲汪所有，於七月十五日曾與汪訂有租約，並付押租二百萬元，言明房租按月一百萬元。故對汪已無關係。繼再傳證人奧多汽車公司俄人羅伯仁，及德人哈生保希，羅哈兩人皆係汪柱臣摯友，羅曾接受汪柱臣寄存汽車另件，哈曾於汪所設之新友公司中任技術顧問，供詞甚含糊。所有證人審訊一過，再度提汪柱臣。汪供稱：同濟大學畢業生，曾赴德留學，歸國後任機械工程師空軍上校廠長，民國三十二年冬奔父喪返滬。嗣後即在本市川公路合夥開設孚中公司，經營汽車材料買賣。及勝利後孚中解散，遂獨資創設新友公司，由姊夫余偉介紹識警備司令部李及蘭接洽特約修理汽車，資本共二千萬元。創設之初擬製造汽車，但卒未果。至四月間遷至北海甯路二號，長島洋行雖遺有汽車另件堆積二房間，然皆廢壞不堪使用，且汽車材料有年代式樣之分別，日人遺物每多不能適用。庭上詰以密告武天祥檢舉出爾運走之另件，係何處來的。答稱：係五月十五日警備部所運來者，共五卡車。當時與警部李處長接洽時，曾設以舊車抵貼修理費，唯恐其來歷不明，曾予拒絕，故後由警備部運來另件，以抵作修費。前後共修五輛，計三輪卡一輛，絡續又小修二十餘輛，另又修理泊於俄國領事館前之日漁船一艘，因需用木材四百餘萬元，故未修竣，現仍停泊原處。庭上又詢，搬運物件爲何在黑夜行之。汪答：晨夜都運，並非故意在夜中。搬出之另件共寄存三處，（一）川公路廠中，（二）中央機器廠，（三）奧多汽車公司。庭上又詢，警備部李處長來函證明。僅修車二輛。汪答稱：不知李處長是何意思。彼所修理實不止二輛。最後庭諭本案尚待搜集材料，改期再審。並稱本案當親自勘查。</p>

<p>慶祝元旦籌備會各組負責人前日舉行會議，決議：（一）規定各機關團體及中等以上學校，於元旦日上午九時，各派代表五人，赴大光明參加慶祝大會。（二）函請各戲院電影院於元旦加演日場，免費招待榮軍及抗　。（三）發動民衆懸旗紮燈采誌慶。（四）加推市參議會爲慰勞組組長，（五）發動各商店减價，優待榮軍及抗　。（六）建議大會籌備會，以極司非而路七十六號或江灣路前日本神社原址，興建忠烈詷等要案多起。</p>
<h3>郵政各支局　改辦共時間</h3>
<p>上海郵政管理局通告：自今日起，所屬各支局平常日辦公時間，改爲自上午七時至下午七時止。（東昌路支局辦公時間，改自上午七時至下午六時止）。</p>
<h3>兵役緩徵召　國防部解釋意義</h3>
<p>關於兵役緩征緩召意義，及警察應否征服兵役一案，市政府昨准國防部公函復開：查現役及齡（屆滿廿歲）男子，於現役徵集時因公出國及學業未完成與犯罪等事故，不應徵服現役者，得依現行兵役法第廿四條各款之規定，予以延期徵集，稱爲緩徵，但因公出國及犯罪原因消滅時，仍受徵集。已畢業後之高中以上學校學生，亦應徵集入營，完成預備幹部教育，至戰時動員召集時，預備役及國民兵，如爲服務於有關國防工業部門之不可代替員工（專門技術員工），學校教師，患病不堪服作戰任務者，與生計困難及犯罪不應召服現役之人員，得依兵役法第廿六條各款之規定，予以延緩動員召集，稱爲緩召。但上項原因消滅時，仍受召集。警察僅負持維地方秩序責任，無現役軍人身份，依法不得緩徵或緩召，惟中央各級警官學校畢業學生，經中央各軍事學校畢業生調查處登記有案者，及曾在高中以上學校畢業，取得軍訓及格證書者，得視爲備役幹部，不再徵集。准函前由，除由本部會銜內政部通飭知照外，租　復請查照云。</p>
<h3>活動鋼屋　能否進口　尚待商洽</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕流動金屋投資公司，於兩星期前，自美國運到活動鋼屋廿五幢，此種鋼屋，一部分爲該公司自購，一部分爲私人所定，預定價格爲二千九百元美金，關稅運費在內。鋼屋目前市價爲五千元美金，照官價結算，約一千七百萬元。據悉此項鋼屋進口時，依未列名金屬貨品條例征課關稅百分之二十，該公司一位此項貨品應依建築材料條例，課稅百分之十五。而「輸入臨時管理委員會」更認此項鋼屋應在禁止輸入之列。故該公司第二批定貨，尚未進行。惟最近市府與社會局，爲解除房荒計，曾向該公司接洽訂購鋼屋，而鋼屋能否進口，須俟海關及「輸入管理委員會」與該公司商洽後再定。</p>
<h3>美輪絡繹至　裝到大批商品</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕美輪世界班孟羅總統號，昨日十二時四十五分進口，停靠大來碼頭。戈登將軍號，原亦定昨日到滬，但至傍晚未見進口。據該公司稱：改今日下午一時到埠。又有麥迪遜總統號，亦定今日到滬，運來大批商品，約五千餘噸，停大來碼頭起卸。</p>
<h3>中央航空公司　發展西北空運　國際航線在籌備中</h3>
<p>中央航空公司爲發展西北空運，特將原飛滬京漢之航綫，改由上海飛南京，鄭州，而抵西安。俟無綫電等裝置就緒，即可實行。</p>
<p>又據該公司負責人稱：中央公司因中英等航約業已簽訂，中法·中英等航約亦有簽訂之消息，故對今後之國際航綫，已在積極籌備中。先擬定二條航空綫，一由上海飛往台灣，中途島，關島等地而抵舊金山。一由上海往香港至海防。惟中央公司向美國訂購之巨型六架尚未來滬，故國際航綫之開闢，短期內尚難實現。</p>
<h3>黃嘉德安然無恙　罹難說全係誤會</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕日前某報誤　聖約翰大學副教務長，西風月刊主編黃嘉德乘中央公司客機失事罹難說，黃氏已於本報刊登啟事否認。其原因係二週前，黃氏與不幸罹難之戴述古牙醫師相值，二人曾交換名片，戴氏乘機時，袋中適留有該名片，致有此誤會。黃嘉德實安然無恙。</p>
<h3>湘南粵北　人無笑容　劉鴻生視察歸來　談兩省災情慘重</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕行總執行長劉鴻生，前赴蘇，皖，贛，鄂，湘，粵視察各該地善後救濟工作及分署內務情形，已於上週六返滬。劉氏昨日下午三時在行總招待記者報告經過，所得感想如下：</p>
<p>（一）關於各分署內部工作，劉氏表示同人均極努力，但有一缺點，即分署同人不瞭解行總整個計劃及其困難，蓋各分署均認爲行總物資財力均異常富裕，足夠應付經常開支，故不惜工本，亦採取工賑等辦法，不知行總物資雖多，而絕分配後，爲數實甚有限，故必需擇其扼要者，急而行之。（二）粵漢鐵路經行總配得火車龍頭十八部，車皮一千二百輛，七十公里長之鐵軌。及枕木二十五萬根，如根據上述各項物資，該路修建工作，理應相當成功，但經視察後，竟大爲失望。然劉氏稱：行總必須協助粵漢鐵路完成，因該署運輸物資至湘，鄂，豫等地最爲捷徑，若週轉由江河運輸，費時又費錢也。（三）劉氏視察湖南廣東時，由長沙至曲江一帶，到處皆有無衣無食之難民，「甚至連手抱之幼童，亦面無笑容」，衡陽街道房屋，破壞殆盡，沿途僅見茅草棚如火柴盒一般，種種情形，實慘不忍睹。劉氏鑒於此種情形，竭力主張目前善後工作雖屬重要，而救濟工作仍不可中止，應予延長三個月。（四）九龍行總公路運輸大隊失火原因，稱係走電，但詳情究竟如何，仍在調查中。最後劉氏並主張各署經費應多用於運輸物資上面，少用於人事方面。</p>
<h3>物價若波動過烈　社局將全面管制　吳開先局長答記者問</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕社會局局長吳開先昨接見本報記者，對詢問各點，賜答如下：</p>
<p>問：年關將臨，物價頗有波動，社會局是否將採有效措置？</p>
<p>答：目前物價上漲之刺激，其次爲季節性之需要增加。除希望央行能將金價抑平外，社會局對於各項日用必需品當嚴加管制。例如以煤球而言，本人已與燃管會負責人協商，對煤場之製造必須加以監督，如此對於平抑煤價，方能收效。</p>
<p>問：如一般物價均有波動時，是否將作全面之管制？</p>
<p>答：如物價全面波動時，社會局亦將採取全面管制。而在生活指數中佔有地位之物品，將首佳考慮。管制之原則將仍爲各業議價，由社局核准執行。</p>
<p>問：年終獎金問題有否完全解決？</p>
<p>答：年終獎金問題大體業已解決。在此事件中，勞資雙方均尚能開誠佈公，實有助於問題之解決。</p>
<p>問：週來不乏工廠停業之事，局長對此作何看法？</p>
<p>答：此種情形，實爲憾事。本人認爲有規模之工商業，必須予以維持。現生產貸款委員會已正式成立，貸款數目甚大，當爲一大助力。本人同時深盼勞工方面能瞭解貸款之最大受惠者爲工人，其次方爲廠房。切勿以爲廠家商業，便可要求花紅。維持工商業，政府有責任，勞方亦有責任。如資方善用貸款，勞方努力生產，則年終難關必能安然渡過。</p>
<p>問：局長對於中美醫院之糾紛有無意見？</p>
<p>答：此事並未提交社會局辦理。中美醫院工作人員屬於公教人員性質，且爲慈善事業，故發生此類事件，實爲遺憾。</p>
<h3>歐哈德案廿七被告　槪須自滬遣送回國　美軍庭檢察官堅決表示</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕將於明春二月間遣送回國之第二批德僑名單，前經當局公佈後，不久又將其中六名取消。此六人中斯多勒及海雪兩人，係現由美軍法庭審訊中之歐哈德局間諜案被告。斯多勒雖已宣判無罪，但仍由美軍　押中，海雪則迄今尚未判決，而前據美軍當局宣稱：凡屬歐哈德局被告，不論有罪無罪，均須遺返本國執行，現斯多勒及海雪兩人自遣送名單中取消，是否表示處置該案被告之辦法已有變更。記者昨特以此詢諸美軍法庭首席檢察官奧康納少校，據談對於中國政府自德僑遣送名單中將斯多勒及海雪兩人取消之事，彼並無所知，美軍立場仍堅持所有歐哈德局被告二十七人全體均須遣送回國。記者復詢以然則是否與我政府交涉，奧康納除再以堅決之語氣述稱，所有人十七人均須回國外，並無確切表示。</p>
<h3>陳家浜場外菜販　請願繼續營業</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕全市數萬場外菜販，當局本擬加以取締，後因　念彼等生計，特准在指定區域內繼續營業·本月十七日·設於山海關路成都路陳家浜一帶之千餘場外菜販，突遭新成警察分局派警驅逐。惟彼等以在當局指定區域內設攤，並未越規，而與場內菜販相處十餘年，至今相安無事，亦並無有妨害場內菜販營業之情事。乃於日前分別向市政府，市參議會，警察總局，新成分局等有關機關，具　呼籲·請求准予繼續營業，以維生計。聞吳市長已有表示，在不妨害交通之原則下，可予繼續設攤。</p>
<h3>軍械庫爆炸案　偵訊工作　告一段落　今日正式公審</h3>
<p>江灣第二軍械庫第一分庫爆炸案，昨日全日繼續偵詢該案有關人員，上午仍在滬東稽查所傳詢運輸兵勞有堅等，下午包主任軍法官在愚園路招待所傳詢運輸隊分隊長嚴普，昨午據包氏語記者：本案偵詢工作，已告一段落，已將偵詢情形，報告秦次長，並擬於明日下午二時，正式由軍事法庭審理該案有關人員，已報由秦次長作最後決定云云。故該案正式公審，當爲今日下午。</p>
<h3>十三層樓一帶　水患可望减輕</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市長樂路馬當路，即舊法租界十三層樓一帶，每屆高潮時，受潮水倒灌，即成泛濫。經工務局設計，將毗連南市之溝管遍裝潮門，並在滬西肇嘉浜日暉港口建築閘壩及喞站，控制潮水，除閘壩已於十月三日完成外，亦已完成，一俟氣候轉和，即施以混凝土工程。該喞站所用大型喞機三座，每分鐘可抽水六萬加侖，已由新通貿易公司承造，俟廠房建造完工，即可裝用。現日暉港潮水，受閘壩及喞站之制止，已不能倒灌。故月來十三層樓一帶，已無積水現象，該處喞站完工後，如遇大雨積水，可開動喞機，抽送壩外，水患自可逐漸减輕。</p>
<h3>市政府紀念週中　錢健夫報告收支</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕財政局主任秘書錢健夫，昨晨在市府紀念週中，對於本市之財政收支情形，及積征制度之改進作綜合報導稱：本年度之稅收逐月增加，而支出亦然。平均上半年度稅收之平均率，約百分之三十六，支出遞增率，約爲百分之二十一，故差額極微。而下半年度，截至十一月份止，收入遞增率爲百分之二十，而支出遞增率爲百分之二十四，兩者損益差額之平均率達百分之五十五，而差額亦增高。其最大之關鍵，在於六月份與八月份之調整待遇，且中央補助款概行停發，新撥土地營業兩稅不能立刻起征所致云。</p>
<h3>丁貴堂案　傳訊檢舉人</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕海關副總稅務司兼上海　　局局長丁貴堂被已離職之海關職員沈博康檢舉有通敵附逆，營私瀆職，欺壓無辜，包庇人事等十大罪狀案，昨日髙檢處傳檢舉人到庭詳細詢問後，論令改期在訊。日內再繼續偵查。</p>
<p>據檢舉人沈博康告記者稱，丁之十大罪狀爲（一）勝利後被丁誣告有漢奸嫌疑而致下獄三月，終以證據不足，不予起訴，然丁本身亦曾任偽職，顯有欺壓無辜挾嫌誣告之罪嫌。（二）丁於民國十七年任江海關稅務司梅樂和之秘書時，海關職員曾有要求提高待遇及收回海關之準備，然因丁之媚外求榮而從中破壞。（三）民國卅一年敵日劫持上海海關時，將漢文科擴大爲漢文處，由丁任處長。當時背叛中央，排斥英美及奴化國人之一切訓令均出其手。（四）不顧法理，係用偽海關副關長盧壽汶爲天津海關副總稅務司。（五）保用偽江海關港務處副處長袁晋爲江海關稅務長。（六）任偽海關統計處長葉元章爲接收敵偽物資要職。（七）在接收後將點收之偽儲備券一百萬萬元密囑陳瓊佩（勝利後被丁保任爲漢口稅務司，最近爲監察院發覺之大舞弊案主角。）以毫無標準之市價向市場掉換，從中漁利。（八）（九）（十）混報愛國捐金，統包碼頭運輸，有假借職權，營私舞弊瀆職之罪嫌。</p>
<h3>復興島　藏金案　幕後秘密人物　不久可能發現</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕復興島藏金疑案，昨日地檢處再傳訊行總職員申錫智，因日前所傳各人，皆供認申即爲密告人「楊　亞」，但昨經顧檢察官對認筆跡及反覆追訊，申似並無即係密告人之嫌疑。蓋目前此案重心首在尋獲密告人，由此綫索或可得悉案情，顧檢察官正於此方面作最大之努力，並已獲得眉目，此神秘幕後人物，頗可能於近期內發現。另有日人在滬創立之三民主義研究會代理理事長握原哲夫，請求保釋日人平井秀紀，小田子二人，是否准其所請，地檢處正考慮中。</p>
<h3>吳市長在大夏大學演講　經濟危機原因　工貸與管制外貨舉辦后　年關或可安渡</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕市長吳國楨，昨應梵皇渡大夏大學之邀，於昨晨十時，在該校紀念週中，演講本市經濟</p>
<p>危機之原因，茲錄其大意如次：本人於今年五月上任之初，即召集各業理事長對經濟問題交換意見。當時多數認爲工資問題最爲迫切，然本人則認爲失業問題尤爲嚴重。</p>
<p>本市造成經濟危機之因素有四：</p>
<p>（一）高利貸：如新亞藥廠於最近借款二十一億元，以利息一角半計算，則每月須三億元，自難以維持。</p>
<p>（二）高工資：工人於昔日帝國主義時代，確曾受資方剝削，然戰後工資已普遍提高，如紡織業工人之酬給，已超出戰前之四倍，假若工人再作額外苛求，則工廠停業後，失業者仍爲工人。所以希望工人自己皆能明瞭，亦望社會人士予政府以同情。中國欲求復興建國，第一要爭取市場，南洋市場是我們所應爭取的，但是現在日本的紗在南洋抵　八十元一件，這就是表示日本已看準了我國的弱點，而以低工資的紗暢銷南洋，以爭取市場。</p>
<p>（三）外貨傾銷：對於舶來品，需要的我們歡迎，不需要的便可拒絕。棉花是製紗的必需品，我們仰給於美國，其數量極爲可觀，總計每年須二億美金。中國是以農立國的，爲什麽不能自己生產呢？我們必須努力。</p>
<p>（四）交通不便。我是國民黨黨員，但是各位應該知道，我是個自由主義者，而現在我已經成爲反動派了。美「生活」「時代」雜誌發行人魯斯來華時，我曾把這個告訴他。本人在上海六個月，深覺經濟情形之凍結在於交通不便，交通不便的原因，在於共產黨的搗亂。若內戰愈延長，交通即不可能恢復，而經濟亦無從好轉。人民因爲生活不安定起而攻擊政府。我有決心要把上海弄好，但是我却處處碰釘子。就拿肉價來作　喻，我曾經到過很多肉攤相詢肉價飛漲的原因，他們給我的回答是：「市長，這是你無法控制的，肉的來源是蘇北，運輸困難，再加上沿路的苛捐雜稅，便不得不賣這個價錢了。」總而言之，抑平物價，安定生活之先決條件是和平，內戰再打下去，老百姓再也無法過日子了。</p>
<p>大家都在爲即將來臨的年關而擔憂，認爲陰陽兩個年底，使我們最難過的時候，但是本人認爲工業貸款，與管制外貨舉辦後，或可安然渡過。</p>
<p>你們都是青年人，青年人都是純潔的，但是在政治情形錯綜複雜的目前，採取行動雖可不必，而研究政治却是需要的。你們必須明瞭經濟危機根源之所在，並且希望永遠不忘記青年時代的純正的思想。</p>
<h3>生產貸款委會　修訂貸款須知</h3>

<h3>滿目凄凉·不堪回首　狂歡聖誕夜　唯有夢中尋</h3>
<p>〔本報特寫〕今年的聖誕節，真有點說不出的凄凉和寒傖。走在馬路上看看樹窗，總覺得不像話：草草率率的黏上一小塊棉花，就算是點綴聖誕了。不知要走過多少條街，才能看見一個聖誕老人的影子。上海簡直成了破落戶。</p>
<p>然而你如果要　買點禮物送人，自己就得是個　客，一雙看得上眼的羊毛襪，標價四萬五千元。一個烟斗要五萬塊。一輛像火柴盒子似的玩具吉普車，也得花法幣一萬五千！</p>
<p>說是玩吧。聖誕夜的狂歡，只能到記憶中去追尋了。世事多艱，連玩個痛快，也已不可能。舞廳十二時必須打烊。警局毫不通融。如果你仍想去凑凑熱鬧，還得先盤算盤算腰包，沒有三五十萬塊錢，當心呆望着帳單臉紅。</p>
<p>就是在家裏消磨聖誕夜吧，買隻火雞得十一二萬元，白蘭地要六萬元一瓶，別的且不去說它。在這樣的年月裏，快樂的聖誕，（物質上快樂的聖誕），原是費錢的！</p>
<p>本市將近百十個大小基徒教堂，都各有一定的慶祝節目，但無論如何將比不上去年聖誕節在天　舞台那樣一個熱烈的擴大耶誕音樂會。盟軍在滬的人數不多，也沒有像去年一樣，把一百零一顆燦爛裝璜的聖誕樹，分送給各單位了。只有八仙橋青年會，從十五日起到二十八日止，都排定了慶祝節目。今天（廿四）是青年組集會，除了崇拜，聚餐，遊戲，音樂，交換禮物等一般節目，特別加上了一項跳舞，是其他各日沒有的。這幾天的青年會又掛起了年燈，佈置得燦爛奪目，令你不是基督徒也願一臨其勝。</p>

<h3>「殺鷄取卵」　苛捐雜稅應當減輕　市參議會即將討論</h3>
<p>市參議員陸惠民等建議本市房捐市政建設捐及一切稅捐，莫不在增倍養，似未顯到商民之艱困，且外國貨源源輪入，以致本國工商業不能競爭，一落千丈，甚至倒閉時開，雖其原因甚多，而苛捐雜稅，貿占重要因素，一般商人不能在正當之商業上發展，不得已乃轉趨於高利黛一途，以圖有延殘喘，今本市地價稅，已於三十五年十一月開徽，市政經費，已有着落，毋須再事繼續徽收，以作殺鷄取卵之措置，故急需配合現實，應將稅收率减低藉以救濟，而蘇民困，故特建議市政經費應在地價稅項下支撥，如有不數，常請行政院飭財政部撥款補助，該會秘書處業已將此建議交第二次大會討論。</p>

<p>五金貨價受外匯刺激，再度上升，　　混亂，大都關住不賣，實際上實銷仍　，致徒有喊價而乏成交。</p>
<h3>食糖漲風猛烈</h3>
<p>昨糖市以現貨依然軋跌，而又以金　關係，更爲瘋狂，汕　初開僅十一萬五千元，成交二百餘包，　　　以十一萬二千元起，直升至十三萬元，計三百包之　，猛升二三萬元，廣帶開海南赤四十包，十四萬九千元，升度相仿，薄片　呌十四萬元，興化幫開質粉白十七萬七千元，次之十七萬二千元至十七萬元，　赤十六萬二千元，百餘　，　　　刁　數十包，初爲十一萬五千元，後爲十二萬元至十二萬五千元，公會劃盤亦有萬元上落，中砂白及生砂赤俱形混亂，須俟台糖可以出貨，方有持平之望。</p>
<h3>北貨亦起漲風</h3>
<p>北貨平疲已久，近亦轉升，其中　　之貨，更形緊秀，如大片廳房子，升至三十一萬元，湘蓮五十八萬元，木耳七十五萬元，金菜普通二十五六萬元，特高呌三十萬元。</p>
<h3>米市多無正式交易　食油空前狂漲！　豆餅雜糧無不俏利</h3>
<p>米市南北共到九千餘石，北粳因來源稀少，竟少做開，秈米亦以到存兩乏，亦無正式成交，惟南粳早薄稻及蘇　路一帶來貨尚接，均照審議價格交易，白元無變化，陰元亦少榮辱，油市因青島報漲，店方納胃暢旺，互相爭收，重見劇烈之奔騰，生油狂漲一萬六七千元，豆油亦飛漲七八千元，清油蔴油均飛騰萬餘元，豆餅因台灣消化濃旺，兼之汕頭問津，市價驟漲千元，黃豆本街油廠及內地相繼收吸，異常俏俐，續漲一二三千元，菉豆隨之跟漲一二千元，赤豆　化亦殷，再升二千元，芝蔴　　暢納，繼續上漲四千元，生仁亦因粵方加強收購，價格步砌，續見飛升七八千元，苞米亦漲千元，小麥依然趨挺，麵粉來源仍稀，市勢益翔，續漲三五百至千元，麩皮鄉消　活，再加六七百元。</p>
<p>又訊，據社會局糧食課吉課長告記者：市府目前在滬控制有存米四十二萬担以上，如萬一情勢緊張時，即可拋售，予投機者以致命打擊。但在新榖登場之時，此種現象不致發生。上海食米之每月消耗量爲四十五萬担，故每日如到貨一五〇〇〇担時，供應量即爲正常。又糧食部上海總倉庫主任葉新明昨日亦至社會局，對於本市今後食米之供給及管理問題，有所接洽。社局經濟行政處昨日派幹員三名，會同警察局財政局人員，對經營米，糖，棉布之商號，作嚴密檢討，以防止投機行爲。</p>
<h3>配紗問題　第五期配紗　將暫行停止　新辦法在擬訂中</h3>
<p>棉紗複配會自辦理配紗以來，已歷七次，初時受配會員公會，單位僅六業，嗣以外埠工廠停止搭配後，其餘額即由駝絨，蓬帆，織帶等三公會，參加受配，單位增加，工作自繁，迭次配紗，均以各業情形不同，而配給之紗，或以支數不合，種類不全，數量不均，或偶然停電停機等種種問題，時生糾葛，此種技術上之困難，雖經數度會商，然仍難解決，現該會鑒於目前棉紗趨勢，當局雖有「以花易紗」及恢復自由買賣之意　，然不論其如何變更，複配工作，均不致廢止，茲以第四期四次配紗，即將完畢，第五期配紗，是否依照新辦法施行，當局尚在研究中，故在新辦法未公佈前，配紗工作，或將暫時中斷，現該會對各同業配到之紗及其用途迄未明瞭，茲爲改進今後困難，擬乘此事務稍閒之際，對何種成品需要何種支數，逐一調查明白，俾資統計，貢獻有關當局參考。</p>
<h3>廠紗更見激昂</h3>
<p>人絲　貨均隨金價進退</p>
<p>昨日上午金紗又告猛　，以致絲無前市情况極形混亂，下午金紗低回，絲　亦呈軟化，人造絲一二〇號東洋有光上午做過七十六萬元，下午喊六十五萬元，高山上午做七十萬元，下午最小喊五十萬元，結果仍比上週末六十萬元左右，其餘各號貨均亦提升十萬元之　，　經市况更形激昂，前市C級喊過五百六七十萬元，普通零担高檔做五百萬元，千　喊到三百七八十萬元，但無一成交，後市金鈔銳落，喊價跟隨下降，最後價與上週末無甚軒輊，　貨情形亦同，被面　過九十五萬元，格　縐出九千元關，華巾縐上午做過三千八百五十元，下午因買戶氣餒，結果與上週末軋平。</p>
<h3>紗價漲</h3>
<p>昨日紗市隨金價而上升，客　買　仍懈，惟業中人以金昂而捏牢，不顧輕易放售，是以廿支紗好起五六萬，四十二支雙綫亦哄上十萬之譜，晨間申新紗廠有廿支天女散花三百件開出，價爲二百廿五萬，俱爲紗號家吸納云。</p>
<h3>港貨訂貨　依黃金計算</h3>
<p>頃據進出口業權威方面稱：本市鉅商，最近數月來，移往香港者，日益增多，各地游　亦逐漸集中香港，以致港地商行，向本市訂購物資，最近多有按黃金折合國幣計算者，此亦刺激最近黃金上漲因素之一。</p>
<h3>天津紗布解禁　工商倒風已起</h3>
<p>〔本報天津廿三日電〕津治安當局，頃率平行轅令，對向在管制中之花·紗·布予以解禁，准商作正當運銷，五金汽油等，如有正式機關證明，亦可放行，又一般工商業近以年關屆臨，已開始受倒風　擊，各業商號年終結賬，率多虧蝕，日來向　局申請歇業者日有廿餘家，唯銀行銀號鼎盛一時。</p>

<h3>倒風又起　成大銀號　停止交換</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨日市場盛傳本市四川中路成大銀號宣告倒閉，經記者走詢經過，獲悉該號曾一度於本月十四日，因在票據交換所之帳目，未能軋平，後雖於十六日彌補清訖，惟上週間各日，即連續發生提存風潮，共計提去七億元之鉅，頭寸盆感短絀，經多方設法，仍得軋平。惟上週六一日間被提去二億元之鉅，致該號在交換所帳戶，又告不能軋平。終於昨日被交換所通告停止交換，暫停營業。據該號某負責人自稱：該號所收存款，共十一億元，而放賬則達十七億元，故收支相抵尚有餘。惟因放賬較濫，故現在正待追索。一俟交換所頭寸軋平，仍當繼續營業。按該號總店在重慶，香港正在籌設分店，本市分店，方於本年九月十六日開設云。</p>
<h3>證交經理王志莘談　東北經濟狀况</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕證券交易所總經理王志莘氏，於上月十二日飛平轉瀋陽長春等地，考察東北經濟狀况，前後歷時三十餘日，頗有所獲，記者昨日特趨訪問，承發表談話如次：</p>
<p>凡屬中國國民到了東北，當無有不與深厚之國家觀念者，個人此次前往，爲其雖短，感觸甚多，第一是興奮，東北之富饒，誠不啻遍地黃金，如農業方面，有大豆，高粱，麥子，足敷民食而有餘，礦藏方面，有煤鐵銅錳金，藏量均用於全國，滿山森林，材木不可勝用，畜牧　業，極爲發達，並富漁　之利；動力方面，亦得天獨厚，可利用水力發電之處甚多；鐵道貫通全境，相當全國鐵道三分之一以上；又有極長之海岸綫；可通航之河流後，縱橫貫通；尤應特別指出者，東北除富於物資外，更擁有勤苦耐勞之人民，總之東北之富源民力，具備謀我國富強之一切條件，中國之有東北洵足自豪！但另一感想是悲憤與警惕，東北自九一八被敵侵佔後，即積極開發與榨取，推行二次五年計劃，包括農林，礦產，工業，電力，國際貿易等各經濟部門侵略性之開發與拓展，更擬輔以廣泛之　施移民，其計劃之深遠與規模之龐大，無不顯示敵人之處心積慮，就瀋陽市一區而言，經政府接收之敵偽工廠，即有一千三百多單位，其他各地重工業之規模，幾可與英美比擬；此外都市建設工作，如長春瀋陽之氣象宏偉，亦屬客觀。凡此種種大都在太平洋事變以前短時間內逐步進行；良以敵人自九一八以後，視東北爲更大規模侵略之根據地，故其發掘資源之亟，奴役人民之酷，得未曾有。致東北人民終歲勤勞而不獲溫飽，凡目睹東北之實况者，能不悲憤？惟其經營之力　實有足資吾人警惕與借鏡者。第三點感想是焦慮，東北之經濟建設，在敵人之侵略野心下已具規模，抗戰勝利後，政府曾網羅全國優秀人才；準備前往接收，不幸受制於國際與國內之兩重力量，所有工廠重要設備，旣被一再拆遷，又經陸續摧燬，勝利之果垂手失之，至今仍局部相持於軍事狀態中，運輸困難，一切經濟復員，工業建設，均困難萬狀；設長此以往，軍事不能從速結束，交通不能從速恢復，政治不能早日步入正規，則東北局勢之嚴重，人民生活之痛苦，何堪設想，深感焦慮；且不僅焦慮，更有令人應憂急者，東北地廣物阜，一片大好土地，接壤強鄰，難免受人垂涎，以往淪於敵人之統治者，已十有餘年。今國土重光，設吾人猶不能憬悟於歷史的教訓，不能化干戈爲玉帛，不能速使政治清明，經濟重建，以鞏固國防改善民生，則九一八的悲劇，恐難免重演！綜合本人觀感，希望全國人士，亟應重視東北，安定東北，保衛東北，建設東北。</p>
<p>記者旋又就證券交易所之未來計劃，就詢於王氏，乘談：亟望各界能充份利用證交機構，以發行新股票或公司債。以達成真正資本市場之目的。關於此點，王氏特舉兩例：（一）政府接收之敵偽產業，或將發還民營之大規模國營企業，如需要籌募資金時，證交亟願代勞。（二）查現今一般工商企業，其規模及資本，均嫌不夠，將來勢須擴充，亟望能通過證交之機構，以籌集所需之資金。最後，王氏稱：終望證交此一機構，能對國家經濟發生協助之作用云。</p>

<p>瀋陽十日航訊</p>
<p>東北的西邊狹長區域裏，活躍着一個遊牧民族，那裏有盟旗，有王公，旗長，有憨直的人民，有成羣的牛羊，也有從遊牧習慣了農墾的人們，這就是大家所熟知的東北蒙旗所在地，也就是近來報章雜誌所說的「東蒙」。</p>
<p>東蒙演變一斑　東蒙是指這塊方在內外蒙東方的意思，這幾同着熱河，計有三盟，二部，三十八或。三盟襄的哲里木盟，屬有十一旗，在遼北省七旗，嫩江省二旗，吉林省一旗，松江省一旗；其次是「卓稁圖盟」和「昭烏達盟」都在熱河，卓盟屬有七旗，昭盟屬有九旗；二部是「呼倫貝爾部」和「布特哈部」，前一個屬有六旗，後一個屬有五旗，都在興安省境裏。</p>
<p>九一八事變前，這裏的人民，聽命，受治，孜孜牧畜，篤信佛教，很少有問題。偽滿的時代，除了熱河，把這裏劃成了興安東南西北四個省，後來爲了所謂「高度國防」和「國境省」的關係，又把興安東西南三省和龍江省的醴果，擴在了一起，成立了一個興安總省，置總省公署在王爺廟，總省分爲若十區域，設置地區行署，至於興安北省，因爲有接近外蒙等特殊關係，仍然存在，省公署設在海拉爾。</p>
<p>光復後的東蒙，起了變化，發生了問題。蘇軍在去年八月十二日到達了王爺廟，少壯派的人們，在哈豐阿主持下，發宣言，成立了一個所謂「東蒙古人民共和國」，海拉爾的人們，自己成立了一個「自治政府」，齊齊哈爾的人們，則又另有打算。</p>
<p>國民政府，中共，蘇聯，外蒙，是東蒙政治家們選擇歸屬的對象。不久，共黨勢力進入了東蒙，四十來歲的少壯派哈豐阿，和中共關係最密切，遂作了這個時代的寵兒，共軍隨着進入了東蒙，高唱扶助東蒙古自治運動，在政治方面，成立「東蒙自治政府」，軍事方面，則有「東蒙人民自衛軍」，淸算，鬥爭，開始在這裏展開，一切都開始演變。</p>
<p>盟旗分佈狀態</p>
<p>東北蒙旗分佈最多的省份是興安省，計有「呼倫貝爾部」和「布特哈部」，前者屬有新巴爾虎左冀旗，新巴爾虎右翼旗，（鄰臍濱），陳巴爾虎旗，（鄰海拉爾），額爾克納左翼旗，（鄰室韋），額爾克納右翼旗，（鄰奇乾），索倫旗，（鄰海拉爾），布特哈旗（鄰景星和扎蘭屯）等六旗，後者屬有阿柴旗，（鄰索倫），莫力達瓦旗，（鄰布西局），巴彥旗，（鄰嫩江），喜札嘎爾旗，（鄰索倫）等五旗</p>
<p>哲里木盟所屬十旗，散處在嫩江，遼北，吉林，松江四省境內。在遼北省境內，計有科爾沁左冀前旗，（鄰康平·法庫·彰武），科爾沁左翼中旗，（鄰遼源·通遼·瞻榆·魯北），科爾旗左冀後旗，（鄰康平·昌圖·遼源），科爾沁右翼前旗，（鄰洮安·突泉），科爾沁右翼中旗，（鄰突泉·瞻榆），科爾沁右翼後旗，札賁特旗，（鄰泰來·景星），在嫩江省境內的，有依克明安旗，（鄰扶餘），社爾伯特旗，（鄰安達·泰康），在吉林省境內的，有郭爾羅斯前旗，（鄰乾安·長岑·扶餘·農安），松江省境內有郭爾羅斯後旗，（鄰肇東肇州·安北·呼蘭·扶餘·雙城）。</p>
<p>熱河省有卓索岡盟，屬轄七旗，計喀喇沁左冀旗，（鄰建平），喀喇沁中旗，（鄰凌源），喀喇沁右翼旗，吐默特右翼旗，吐默特左翼旗，（鄰朝陽），吐默特中旗，（鄰朝陽），庫倫旗；昭烏達盟屬有巴林左翼旗，（鄰林東），巴林右翼旗，翁牛特左翼旗，翁牛特右眞旗，（鄰赤峯），阿魯科爾沁旗，（鄰天山），奈曼旗，札魯特旗，（鄰開魯），克什克騰旗，（鄰林西·經棚），敖漢旗，（鄰建平），等九旗。</p>
<p>以上的稱呼和轄屬，是東北蒙旗的現行制度，又據東北行轅蒙旗復員委員會調查，布特哈是打牲部的意思，是地理名詞，不是種族名詞，布特哈區域裏有蒙古達哈爾·索倫·郭勒春·滿洲·奇勒·馬爾涅克等部族，九，一八以前，東西布特哈，在黑龍江省，並非行政單位，偽滿時東西布特哈八旗人民，大部遷至西布特哈，現在嫩江訥河留存一部份東布特哈。此外在遼寗省彰武縣，有蘇醫克旗蒙古，係永·福·昭·三陵供祭牛羊的牧民，共約三萬多人。</p>
<p>東蒙三區輪廓</p>
<p>有人視察蒙胞地區回來說：東蒙南部是錦熱地區，蒙人多數爲漢人同化，習於農耕生活，習慣和漢人無異，甚至蒙人也有不說蒙古話的，蒙漢間有的通婚了喇嘛教雖然存在，但是已呈義落現象，因爲它整個社會，已經全部融化於漢人，所以雖經日人的挑撥，也不會產生什麽較大的作用。</p>
<p>北部是偽興安省地區，很少有漢人的足跡，蒙民還是營其原始生活，偽滿時受日本的教育也極少數，民智閉塞，沒有政治的要求。</p>
<p>中部就是王爺廟以南錫拉拉木淪以北的地方，是東蒙自治運動的根據地，情形極爲複雜，除了開書·林西·通遼·醴泉·四縣境內全部是漢人外，其他各旗，都是蒙漢雜居，土著蒙人，因爲不習農耕，都在沒開墾地區營其遊牧生活，在開墾的地帶，則有漢人和由錦熱地區移入的蒙人，這一批蒙人雖然已經漢化，但是意議又復萌芽，且以蒙古先進自居，近來從事東蒙自治運動的就是這些人們，土著蒙民不過受他們領導而已。</p>
<p>喇嘛教在東蒙，除了南部和一部份靑年外，大多還是熾烈的信奉着，這是他們精神生活的歸宿，人人幻想着「一僧得道，九族昇天」的將來，今天，前進的蒙胞，打算把他們帶到高度自治的世界去。</p>
<p>國個復員盟旗</p>
<p>國軍從南方和東方，接近了蒙旗，遼北省境的科爾沁左冀各旗，早已進入了國軍的懷抱，其他的蒙旗，也在陸優的跑過來。現在介紹科爾沁左翼前，後，中三旗在下面。</p>
<p>科爾沁左翼前旗，又呌賓岡旗，在東蒙各旗裏，是文化比較發達的一個旗。東鄰科後旗，南接遼寧的法庫和彰武，西至庫倫旗境，北方靠近左翼中旗，面積東西九十華里，南北一百八十華里，在哲里木蒙是最小的一個旗。人口約十一萬六千人，漢人約六萬九千人，蒙人的四萬七千人。半耕，半牧，蒙胞農業生產方式，也很進步，旗政府在章古台，現由烏寳代理旗長。</p>
<p>科爾沁左翼後旗，又叫博王旗，東接遼寗省界，面積東西約一百八十里，南北二百五十里。人口九萬六千人，漢人一萬五千人，蒙人的八萬一千人，地當遼河琉域，頗多沃壞，是哲里木盟開墾最早的一個旗，旗政府在吉爾嘎朗，由希格代理旗長。</p>
<p>科爾沁左翼中旗，又呌達爾罕旗，南接左翼後旗，面積東西一百八十里，南北八百餘里。人口約二十五萬人，漢人五萬，蒙胞二十萬，墾殖情形頗佳，人民多以農業爲主，畜牧次之，旗政府在巴彥塔拉，旗長暫由賀喜業勒圖墨爾根代理。</p>
<p>最後，說到吉林郭爾羅斯前旗，位置在嫩江和松花江的合流點，面積東西一百八十里，南北三百里，在東北蒙旗中是晨耕最發達而土地又最肥沃的蒙旗。旗政府設在農安，達地木林多爾濟代理旗長。全旗人口十七萬，漢人的十二萬五千，蒙胞約三萬五千人。</p>
<p>熱河的喀喇沁右冀旗，左翼旗，中旗，吐默特左翼旗，右翼旗，中旗，奈曼旗，以及在嫩江省境新收復的幾個蒙旗，將來再介紹給大家。</p>
<p>問題如此發生</p>
<p>淸末，漢人陸續移入蒙胞住地，到了民國，又幾度提倡移民，由是漢人移入就一天多一天。廿九年，偽滿盬及蒙漢土地問題的復雜，幷爲整理地籍起見，通令漢人農民，預出租金廿五年，作爲購價，以取得土地的所有權，把這筆款子存入偽滿中央銀行，以它的利息撥交蒙民，由蒙民組識裕生會，充作蒙民的生產教育經費。光復後，蒙民蒙受了損失，無處補償，只有向漢人農民索租，漢農不肯担負兩次的租金，雙方因而發生極大的磨擦。</p>
<p>在縣旗幷立的地方，蒙胞受治於蒙旗，漢人歸屬於縣府。些許的糾紛，蒙胞告到了蒙旗，漢人訴之於縣府，縣旗較小聯緊，沒法解決，遂又各轉上級機關，添枝生葉，弄得不可開交，情感遂漸隔閡，惡化。</p>
<p>偽滿——也可以直截了當的說是日本官吏，對於蒙胞教育頗爲重視，但教育宗旨是另有目的的，看到他們所定的教育方針裏，有「其基本方策即將從來之漢蒙共同教育，使之分離，一方整備蒙系之中等學校，以期養成中堅分子」等語，已經可以知道一些梗概。</p>
<p>日本官吏，以教育和政治雙管齊下的政策，來離間漢蒙間的感情，在政治上分成了日人，蒙人，漢人三個階級。學校裏用的是日文和蒙文，說的是日語和蒙語，在這裏，蒙胞較漢人受優待，這些在分化和隔絕上，起着許多效用。據說不滿於一切的，頗多是扎蘭屯「興安師範」和王爺廟「興安學院」的學生。</p>
<p>蒙胞需要甚麼</p>
<p>東北行職，爲了辦理蒙旗的復員，特成立了一個「蒙旗復員委員會」，他們在協助各蒙旗所在地的省府和蒙旗，加緊蒙旗的復員工作，他們在舉辦蒙古人才登記，幷派有許多工作團體到蒙旗地方工作，他們的政策，對於今後蒙旗民政的人權問題，可參考蒙族人士的意見，以免再蹈過去分歧籠絡的覆轍。</p>
<p>東北蒙旗留漢同胞，在瀋陽成立了一個「東北蒙旗委負會」，他們組織了幾支東北蒙旗自衛軍，協助政府和國軍接收蒙旗，並組織了一個隨軍工作團，隨同國軍前進，從事安撫和宣傳工作。他們還打算辦一個「新蒙古導報」，現正在籌備和募款中，以便編印漢蒙文新聞，並從事著論立說，打破隔膜，這是蒙胞在瀋陽的一個唯一民眾團體。</p>
<p>一般人意見，今後注意蒙胞的生活問題，主要的是呌他們生活安定，如能根據蒙胞的生活環境，利用科學方法，以改良他們的畜牧，分區設立牧塲，以防默疫的流行，使他們以牛羊計算的財富，日有增加，再從而擇地設立製革毛織工業，則蒙旗同胞的生活水準，自必能日益提高。至於恢復和建設交通，普及教育，都可相繼舉辦。經濟基礎旣立，政治地位，地方自治。都可順利完成。也有人主張蒙漢等族人民，旣然雜居，旗縣仍可並存，但須實行合法互治，同時並實行保護牧畜政策，不再多墾優良牧地，少數民族需要合理的生存·發展，不必特殊化。</p>
<p>目前，好多蒙胞代表，在「臨大」會議上，以及向各界表示，呼籲，都希望在憲法上應顧及少數民族的利益，盟旗制度，也須在憲法上取得合理的地位．此間一般人的意見，如有好的辦法，盟旗制度雖然是封建時代的遺留，但蒙胞已習慣了它，存在一時也無妨，而對於少數民族的利益，政府當然格外要顧及。</p>
<p>高山族同胞歡迎視察團（上）台省交通處長任顯羣率視察團員訪問花運港高山族（下）高山族婦女便裝（本報特派員江暮雲攝）</p>
<h3>台東行（二）　太平洋的暖流</h3>
<p>— 本報特派員江暮雲</p>
<p>兩個港灣：加路蘭·新港</p>
<p>台北十二日航訊</p>
<p>作爲東台灣唯一的生命綫的，就是太平洋的暖流（黑潮），這一條從北赤道流過菲列賓經台東沿岸逕注入日本海的浪潮，它滋養着荒僻的東台灣，東部人民把它當作神似的，憑藉這暖流來維持他們的生活。因爲這暖流是最能吸引魚類的簇居，捕魚人兒現在已不窮，冒險的打捕浮魚，使他們得安然應付高度的生活。他們感謝暖流，他們和暖流相依爲命。</p>
<p>溪流不通舟楫　治水特別重要</p>
<p>視察團一行，在七日早晨仍搭原車順沿縣道向北行駛，這是一條縣通，有幾處還未修竣，我們穿過日本人崇楊爲「東洋第一」大橋的台東大橋，這是一絛鐵索橋，日本人最愛這樣的建築，任處長說號稱「東洋第一」，未免自誇，不過堪以代表海島橋樑的建築。</p>
<p>公共工程局長費驊和李葉兩主任工程師，他們很興奮的告訴記者有關東北的水利問題。一般的說，合灣東西海岸對中央山脈分水嶺，題離是一與二之比，西部已經惑到坡度太陡，治理維艱，東部各溪不僅坡度倍大，且一人台東縱谷，就作九十度的急轉向南北分流入海，而來自二三千公尺高的大量礫石，無力輪入海內，全部存留縱谷，尾圖旣塞，中淤日見增高，眞像黃河之水從天上來，所以築壩攔砂，都不是辦法，而需要東溪攻淤，减少亂流，以治水來維持交通安全，保護已有的耕地。</p>
<p>在不通舟楫的溪流裏，戰時日本人就沒有力量將旣有損毀的提防修復，這一年來，他們化於構築堤防的經費已經相當可觀。南部防波提約六百公尺，秀姑巒溪玉里堤防增土牆冲毀，新武呂溪下游全長二四五〇公尺保護耕地二萬畝的堤防，今年洪水給予極大的損壞，居民都要求從速修理，否則高山族集體四山去，現已決定修築，工程費約四百萬元。</p>
<p>過去日人禁止高山族入山，盡量給予他在平野耕作爲便利，主要的因此可以防止他們自由燒山，砍伐林木，這樣直接影響了造林，更加深了洪水的災害，現在該局正趕修趕築，希望能保護他們的耕作面積和生活。</p>
<p>天然港加路蘭　决定維持交通</p>
<p>台灣東部有好幾個天然港灣，日本人配合着南進政策，以台灣爲侵略的據點，這幾個港灣大都作軍用。</p>
<p>穿過了台東大橋，我們到了加路蘭港。這是一個天然港，日人在這裏已經準備開闢，而且已構築了一部份，戰爭迫使他們停止了，港灣南部有一個大灣，北部是一個平曠地區，宅可能成爲一個優良的港灣，過去一部份船隻在這裏停靠，糖業和通運公司都設有倉庫，第一年建設計劃，工程費台幣二六三萬，我們在堤岸邊遠眺，火燒烏就在目前，暖流在近岸邊和藍色的海。顯明的呈現不同的色澤，在近邊，岩石積成淺灘。經徐林兩港務局長的察勘，實不宜於停舟，勢必加工開闢。目前所考慮的是築港的價值問題，這一帶沒有大量的糖和米，所可運用的不過是在台東港不能停業時，這裏可以在風季冀岸。任處長對謝縣長興建加路蘭港的要求，允予考慮，他就在這時決定了明年起另闢東部航綫，由墓隆駛到蘇澳，花蓮港，新港，台東，火燒島，紅頭嶼以至高雄，他說，這條錢將暫定期按月二班，明明是虧蝕的，但爲開發合東，便利和維特交通是第一着。</p>
<p>東台灣似乎形成另一個世界的，因爲交通困難，行者裏足，沒有定期船隻，沒有恢復公路汽車，尤其是風季。台灣兩個特產，在東部是它的代表作：颱風和地震。颱風大部在東部登陸，平均每年在三次以上，最大的風速，每秒六十一公尺，地震微動最多，全省每年海震一千多次，東部則在六三〇次以上，而在颱風着陸時，緊跟着是山洪爆發，給水困難，交通阻斷。東部人民和各地方行政機關，與大自然的奮鬥，是堪以謳歌的，尤其是交通的隨時修復，更值得崇揚，而決定東部的交通，除公路已通車外，航輸的駛行更是台東民眾喜訊！</p>
<p>台東漁港新港　即將復興成長</p>
<p>台東縣治下轄有三區，十六鄉鎮，一百村里，離縣城東北五十一米的新港是一個區鎮，過去日本人曾譽爲代表郡。這裏是東部唯一漁港，原先希望築成三萬噸的港，十四年前日本人化了八十多萬，把它就築成了現在的港灣，可以容納八十絛漁船，有兩個修船所，以前可以自製三百噸以下的漁船，如今和冷凍塲一樣，因爲電力不及二百個K·w，正停頓着，目前有漁船十七條，他們淸晨駛入暖流，漲潮時便回到了水深三公尺的基地。這些漁民經日人每年招募單身漁民後，前四年即達二五〇名，每天有八十餘艘到海面撈魚，最高年產量達一百匹十餘萬公斤。</p>
<p>附誌：本文（一）台東視察團團員，應更正爲十五個單位，其中漏列農林處朱剛夫專門委員一名，又李春松之松字誤作升字，合併更正。</p>

<h3>美滿的結婚生活</h3>
<p>— 潘味琴</p>
<p>戀愛是一首美麗的情詩，現實的生活却是一本賬簿。從沒有見過情詩裏寫着：「米六萬元一石·菜五百元一斤。」也從沒有見過賬簿裏記着：「在默默地靜靜地中間，傳遞了我倆的心波」。這是戀愛和現實的生活的不同。</p>
<p>正在戀愛中的靑年們，他（她）們多數是耽於空想。他（她）們想着：『將來在結婚的時候，應當採取那一種儀式？到那裏去度過那美麗的蜜月？應該怎樣去佈置那房問？房間裏的傢具應該漆成那一種顏色？……。這些問題，差不多是每一對戀愛成熟的情人們，所常常在那水畔樹蔭低低地討論着的。他們都想像　一個美滿的婚後。他們以爲結婚以後一定可以享受到很多的幸福；然而，事實上結婚所帶來的，却是一大串現實的問題。</p>
<p>結婚是人生的一課，決不能建築在那些美麗的夢幻上面。結婚是一個家庭的開始，一個家庭需要的是現實的生活。結婚的人，先應當考慮到婚後怎樣生活下去？婚後的收支如何支配？怎樣準備一筆生小孩的費用。……這一述串的問題，都是婚後所不能避免的，而需要你去解答，除菲你是一個依賴遺產，而沒有自立性的傢伙。假如你想憑自己的力量，去組織一個家庭，而對於這許多問題都沒有深刻的考慮過，但你却貿貿然的結了婚，於是這許多問題便橫在你的前面，每天的柴米油鹽都可能成了你倆吵　的資料。但是在婚前這許多問　都是沒有的，只要逛逛公園，　看電影，說些纏綿的情話，至於柴米油鹽的事情，根本不會鑽入他們的腦海裏去。所以我們只總到過有「柴米夫妻」，幾曾聽到過有「柴米情人」，「老婆是別人的好」，正因爲別人的老婆不會來向你絮聒那些柴米的事情。假如一且別人的老婆成了你的老婆，而也在你旁邊絮聒柴米油鹽的時候，那時你的感覺，也就不會好了。這是婚前婚後的轉變，也正是結婚使戀愛消滅的一個主因。</p>
<p>然而，世界是那麼的大，「結婚」，「戀愛」的範圍又是那麼的廣闊，單作這樣的答覆，當然是不能使人滿意。難道夫婦間感情的破裂，僅祇有柴米問題麼？當然不是。以上所說的，只是一種比較多數的現象。雖然有許多人婚後的生活不成問題，不致每天爲着柴米煩惱，但是夫婦間相處久了，不免漸漸地把自己的短處暴露了出來，而有時對於對方也不肯容忍起來。結果，婚前的感情和本來對於對方良好的印象，漸漸的淡了，淡了，終而至於消滅。原來婚前所看到的對方，多數只是一外型，因爲一方面受了感情的迷惑，任爲對方任何一點，都是可愛的美麗的；一方面，雙方　竭力的掩飾　自己的短處，前方留個良好的印象。但是結了婚，成了永久的伴侶，這短處終難掩飾，而感情迷惑的力量，終　消失的一天。所以『老夫老妻』多數不及「新婚夫婦」的親愛，也正是道一個緣故。</p>
<p>還有一種男子，他們以爲和女子結了婚，這女子便是「他的」了，可以任憑他如何擺佈。雖然在追求她的時候，是那末的卑躬屈節，不惜用種種獻媚的手段。但一結了婚，便擺出一面孔「家主公」的樣子來。他們以爲「香餌只是在沒有捕到魚的時候用一的」。這種觀念如果存在男子們一的腦海中，那是女子們的不幸。一希望女子們對於這種男子多多注意。</p>
<p>總之，婚後的生活，是需要雙方的諒解，互助，這樣才能繼續以往的感情，不致使結婚後變成戀愛的墳墓。</p>
<h3>冬季的童裝</h3>
<p>— 肇英</p>
<p>衣服之目的，在保護人之體溫而不使放散。故冬季宜用不易傳熱之物，法蘭絨等柔軟之毛織物最適宜，其决爲棉布之棉衣。絲織物冬季不能保護體溫，除美觀外，衛生上不甚適用。</p>
<p>小兒之衣服，務宜寬大，泱不可緊縛其身體，以阻其發育。且衣服緊小者，換衣時，時間需久，易受感冒，復有折斷手足之危險。緊縛身體之帶或鈕，亦不可用，不但皮膚易受壓傷，且妨礙其血液之流通，易發生種種疾病。緊縛其肺部，致呼吸不暢，爲害更大。</p>
<p>小兒衣服之材料，質地務宜軟柔，粗硬者易擦傷皮膚，不可用。其色，襯衣必須白色，稍有汚穢即可看出。即不然，亦宜用淡色，深色及褪色者，無論內外衣，均不可用。</p>
<p>小兒衣服之厚薄，以適宜爲度，過薄固不可，過厚也屬不宜，常人以爲小兒身體嬌弱，易受感冒，往往着以過厚之衣服。實則小兒之感冒，由衣服之過厚而來者，較由於衣服過薄者反多。是因衣服過厚者，發汗必多，此多量之　，當蒸發時，從皮膚奪取多量之熱度（物理學上名日蒸發熱），以致皮膚頓覺寒冷，而受感冒也。况發汗過多者，其身體漸漸虛弱，故衣服過厚之害，甚於過薄。試觀貧民階級之小兒，終年赤膊裸體，而身體極強，是乃已成習慣，其皮　之抵抗力增强，自無感冒之患。可知鍛鍊皮膚，則抵抗力增强，不但能免感冒，且有預防各種疾病之效，但鍛鍊之法，須由漸漸而來，如進行急速，反受其害。</p>
<p>小兒在室中時，除冬季外，無須戴帽。因頭部旣有頭髮保護，如更戴帽，則太溫暖，腦中多血，易生頭痛，頭量等病症，且於智識之發達，亦有妨礙。故歐西男子，在室中時，無論冬夏，概不戴　。故在幼時，宜即　成室中不戴帽之習慣。惟新生兒在第一年冬，因頭　　濃，仍需戴帽，至第二年冬，在室中時，即可不必戴帽。</p>
<p>小兒冬季之帽，宜用毛絨編織，取其輕而軟，不可多用金銀等裝飾品，而增加重量。</p>
<p>小兒之衣帽，均宜新製，如不得已而用舊物，必先煮晒消毒方可應用。</p>
<h3>家事常識</h3>
<p>— 順鼎</p>
<p>煤油燈上的玻璃　最易炸裂，宜於玻璃　新買時橫置釜中，注以冷水，水須恰淹沒燈罩，燒之，水沸稍久而後止。待水冷取出，則燈罩質　，頗可耐久，用時不易有爆裂之患。</p>
<p>欲使漿糊不變酸，須於打漿時加入明　少許。</p>
<p>煤油燈之燈罩，每日用後，宜以粗草紙一張。上洒火油一滴，用以擦　之，則　　而發光。</p>
<p>紙壁糊後稍久，其表面必着塵垢，頗不雅觀，若用蒸軟的麵包一片，偏拭紙壁上，即可無絲亳之　　垢，且光彩如新。</p>
<p>洗滌衣服，如用硼砂少許，溶於熱水中，將欲洗之衣服浸於此水中，次量撈出，即潔白如新。</p>
<p>花瓶水中如置食鹽少許而拌攪之，則雖嚴寒亦不致冰裂。</p>
<p>梨如以羅葡間隔之，勿使互相接觸而貯藏之，則雖經年，亦可保其不　。</p>
<h3>婦女與主觀</h3>
<p>— 劉曼雲</p>
<p>即使是四千多年宗法社會生活的思想方式，觀念，至今又配着我們，我們仍覺得主觀是不妥的。</p>
<p>婦女的迷信，敎育兒女的錯誤觀念等都由主觀而來，這兒且談談她們平日瑣屑生活的主觀結果：</p>
<p>先就她們對丈夫的態度說，每當她們的丈夫晚上回來過遲的時候，她們腦海裏總充滿了這些思想：「也許也遇到了女友在談心，」「也許他在舞塲裏樓舞女跳舞，」「也許他在……」這許多猜測釀成了她的憤恨，幽怨，悲哀，而且十分肯定想他在這樣做。於是當丈夫回來時，一臉鐵靑，先使空氣陰暗，於是賣間，爭吵……雖經丈夫的解釋，也消滅不掉她先入爲主的見解了。</p>
<p>她看見一位近來商親戚進門，心中就千眞萬確的以爲他是來借錢，謀事……於是先給人以難堪的冷淡，縱使他不過是來談談想解悶的。</p>
<p>她偶而遇到一個臉嫩的常會不由自主臉紅的陌生人，總以爲他必定做了什麼虧心事，於是猜測，誤會……</p>
<p>聽了隣舍的報道：「某家的小姐近來夜問常出去，」於是：「不知她所交的男友是什麼樣人？」「可能很快結婚？」「或許她已經……」的言語她會脫口而出。　這些耳濡目染的主觀立塲，使我們每會覺不出自己的錯誤。從這主觀的態度裏，可能產生誤會，不睦，甚至悲　。</p>
<p>法庭上對於一個罪犯，猶須經過偵查，搜集證據，　論的手續，何况這些人事實上未必犯罪呢？</p>
<p>生活在現時代，無論什麼事都得從純客觀的立塲去觀察，考慮。假使你觀察準確，判　　　，成功與幸福才有你的份。</p>

<h3>耶穌聖誔的起源</h3>
<p>— 丹林</p>
<p>一年一度「普天同慶」的耶穌聖誕，許多人甚至有些基督敎徒，都以爲是十二月二十五日，是耶穌誕生的日子。其實，事實上並不是的。然而，耶穌出世的眞正日子，是那月那日呢？那就是成了歷史上的謎。一千九百多年來，都沒有人能够解答。任我們從新約的馬太福音，以至啟示錄，及與敎會歷史·世界史等書，都找不出一個確實而有力的證據，即使請那些主敎·神父·收師等傳敎士解答，也得不着正確的日子，因爲在新約聖經裏絕沒有叙述耶穌出生的日子。</p>
<p>那麼，現在爲什麼全世界的基督徒，甚至非基督徒，都用十二月二十五日做取穌降生的紀念呢？這是敎會歷史上的一種「習慣法」罷了，也可以只說是一個「紀念」日子罷了。據「聖經辭典」（註）聖誕節的解釋，是：</p>
<p>「主後三百年，始守此節。西敎會規定之日，是十二月二十五號。東敎會規定之日，是正月六號。然此特敎會規定之日，無憑　者。而耶穌敎數百年來，亦無人守此節期，迨其後漸次進行，而始守之也。）</p>
<p>又「倫理宗敎百科全書」（註）對於「耶穌聖誕」却說：</p>
<p>「……及四世紀時，敎會乃決定耶穌聖誕爲宜紀念者，嗣後乃爲敎會通行之例。福音書上未紀載耶穌生於何月何日，而古人以十二月二十五日爲聖誕，吾人不知何所據而云然。或謂猶太敎本於是日有一節期，故古人沿用以爲耶穌聖誕。」</p>
<p>據此，則知道十二月二十五日，並不是耶穌誕生的正確日子，只是公曆四世紀以後「敎會通行之例」而已。</p>
<p>原來基督敎會在羅馬時代，經過一度遭受教外的鉅大壓迫之後，信徒不特沒有减少，反而銳增，信仰更加堅定，傳敎工作更加努力，一般事業倍加擴展，於是各地敎會突然的興盛起來。在這個時期，有些熱忱的信徒，想着找個適當的機會每年一度來紀念耶穌的降生，表示恭敬感謝的心儀。可是，旣沒有歷史可以稽考，又沒有遺傳可以根據，是無從着手的。那時聰明的傳敎士們便利用當時的環境，就把當地的「沙登節」代替了聖誕日，採取了羅馬人慶祝節期的禮俗，代表基督徒紀念耶穌降生的快樂。這一天，就是現在通行的陽曆十二月二十五日。</p>
<p>說到公歴，今年是一千九百四十六年，但是，按照歷史推算起來，是相差了四年的。不過世界上已經沿用了許久，沒有方法再去更改，這是凡是研究西洋史的多能够知道的了。</p>
<p>聖誕互　賀片，這是不久的事。布一千八百六十二年左右，英國有位名畫家廉得約斯，繪製一種彩色圖片，異常精美，寄給各地的親友，引起社會的注意。於是，數十年來，便成爲慶祝聖誕的一種互贈紀念品，各國的郵局，每年冬季且規定日子爲收件投　的期間。</p>
<p>其他如燃燭，係猶太敎節期常用的；懸掛寄生樹，冬靑葉在房屋中，係英國古敎所行的禮；　燒木柴，係歐洲崇拜天然物的習俗，移植樹木在庭院，掛着彩色物件，係歐洲人民取樂之法；裝成老人樣子，面帶喜容，送禮物給孩提，係歐洲人民舊有的習慣。耶穌聖誕與西歐冬至節期相近，故此，冬至節的習慣，多　入聖誕中了。</p>
<p>註：「聖經辭典」，「倫理宗敎百科全書」兩書，都是上海　學會編譯印行的，是基督敎傳敎士與研究神學的參考辭書。</p>
<h3>冬之窗</h3>
<p>— 叔孫如瑩</p>
<p>雪</p>
<p>你竟如此悄然地來了，在那彤　之後，在那細爾之後，在那西北風之後。西伯里亞的寒流給我們帶來了凜冽的天氣，可也帶來了你·你·我會渴望了一年以上的時日了啊！</p>
<p>你沒有忘記我底狹窄的庭院，我底冬靑樹，和我底衰草；感謝你底拜訪，感謝你底佇留，感謝你底花片撒滿我底屋脊。</p>
<p>你給我以寒冷的確證，給我以皎白的楷模，給我以聖潔的榜樣，給我以往年未曾有過恬適的喜悅。</p>
<p>你裝飾了冬天的山和原野，你爲將要來到的春天消毒了植物的溫床。你爲季節服務，又做了季節的標轍。你給詩人以靈感，又做了詩人底題材。你給缺乏衣著的農人以酷寒的威脅，又給他們以明年豐收的希望。</p>
<p>如果冬天沒有雪，正像春天沒有花，夏天沒有雷雨，秋天沒有落葉，這個世界將多麼荒凉！</p>
<p>陽光</p>
<p>瑟縮在牆縫里的田蟲歡迎你，飛躍在枝頭的小鳥歡迎你，　竹歡迎你，池塘裏的鯽魚歡迎你。一切爲寒冷所困擾的生物都在由衷地歡迎你了，陽光！</p>
<p>你溫煦地照臨吧。從西邊的屋角，到東邊的屋角；從早晨，到黃昏；從十一月的輕寒，到殘冬的酷冷；從菊花憔悴，到春梅含蕾。</p>
<p>你，陽光，是寒冷的叛逆，是溫暖的泉源，是生長與喜悅的保障，是冬天裏的春天，是憤怒者面頰上的笑影。</p>
<p>你，陽光，在黑暗裏最光耀，在寒冷裏最溫暖，在失望之前撤下希望，在痛苦之後帶來歡樂。</p>
<p>你，陽光，鄙視那躱在水汀旁的人羣，鄙視那貪戀被窠的懶惰者。你與田　間的農人同在，與曠場上的靑年同在，與爲自由與正義而戰鬥的英雄同在，與天眞無邪的兒童同在。</p>
<p>你，陽光，有如慈母的心，有如行軍時的樂隊，有如勞動時的高歌，有如決戰時的信念，有如墜道裏的火炬。</p>
<p>如果沒有你，我們如何度過這冬天？</p>
<p>冬之窗</p>
<p>向冬之窗噓一口氣，白色的霧便貼上了窗上的玻璃。</p>
<p>在這茫茫的白色中，你看得見什麼？</p>
<p>也許你看見了寒冷，看見了饑餓，看見了北極的冰山與長白山上的積雪。也許你看見了你童年時手塑的雪人，也許你看見了祖母顫慄的手點起的雪燈，看見了她的衰老的臉，正在等待吉兇的徵兆。也許你看見了明日，看見了初升的朝陽，看見了一條平坦的路，看見了一座輝煌的殿堂。也許你看見了你的歡樂，和你的飄渺的夢幻。</p>
<p>然而，也許你竟一無所見，季節的變幻不能逗起你一點兒懷念和遐思。</p>
<p>那麼，任你決定去留吧，在這冬之窗前，在這生命的濁流裏的一顆沙礫之前。</p>
<p>而我却佇立在冬之窗下，想看一看自已。</p>

<h3>擬情書—摹羅馬沃維德</h3>
<p>— 聖潔</p>
<p>第一簡</p>
<p>秋空是這樣遼闊，但我的心却有異樣的瑟縮和悽惶，一個不朽的鐘情深沉而執着的浸蝕着我現在的生命。</p>
<p>妳能無視於這樣一個年靑的孩子向妳陳訴一些原始的戀情嗎？</p>
<p>也許妳對我那love　at　firstsight的心情會漠然的，但是從暮春到初秋，不算太短的漫漫長夏裏，我一直在靈之池沼裏掙扎，我不信自己會變得這樣怯懦，竟悄悄地用自己的手埋葬了我那奔放欲吐的眞誠和熱情，多少數不淸的長夜，我曾以迢遙的遐想投向梵蒂岡前，默默的，爲妳那永恒的靑春祝福。</p>
<p>歌德禮讚過一種片面的祟高的渴慕，屠格涅夫默許過一個聖潔而蟄鬱的愛的期待，這幾個月來，我是生活在這兩種寗靜的氣氛裏的。不過，妳爲什麼那麼不經意地來掀動我那激越的感情？前幾時妳要「報答」，昨天妳又劃破我那固封在心底的防隄，我實在早應該寫點給妳了，因爲我己不能支持下去：這豪華的歲月彷彿那麼忽忙的從我身邊流過。</p>
<p>假使可能的話今夜我懇摯的在××等待妳踐踏我那生命上的空白。</p>
<p>秋夜如水，又該是我爲妳默禱的時候了。</p>
<p>第二簡</p>
<p>是一脈靜靜的溫情，這樣織柔而又莊嚴的揭開了我的生之渴慕……</p>
<p>秋陽中，我虔誠地默誦了妳那僅有的幾句從靑春裏面迸射出來的慰藉，這天地彷彿已爲妳塑造出了一個完整的意境，伊甸園的影子遂溫存的覆冀了我的心頭。</p>
<p>像一個殉道者爲着他的信念向眞理獻出生命一樣，我決定在妳的面前捧出我那懇摯而無疵的生命的眞誠；幾年來的疆塲生活寄托過我那奔放的熱愛，這是我對人生的熟愛。離開了戰鬥的人生，熱愛是會被歲月的微塵傷害的，於是持一種書良的期待，希冀着這種熱愛的培育與繼承，因此，我纔勇敢而堅決地向妳傾訴出我心底的願望與要求。</p>
<p>但是，妳却一直以冷漠塵封了我的渴求，是否妳的健康如這深秋的沉鬱裏住妳的心頭？吿訴我吧！這一曲啞然的音符，使我的心片片揉碎在無聲的旋律裏了！妳能不能輕輕的向我重道一聲！「秋天裏有着我們的春天」！</p>
<p>我已經把整個生活的影子溶蝕在期待裏，期待着妳的再度展眸一笑，這笑痕將揭開我那被埋葬了的世紀的憂煩！</p>
<p>第三簡</p>
<p>我眞不敢嘗試用顫抖的手去掏取那許多沉澱了的憶念裏的金沙，因爲我已經爲一個冷酷而辛辣的現實封閉了最崇高的熱情。</p>
<p>昨天我開始啜飲了這人生中一杯難逢的苦酒，秋風裏懷着一顆童稚的心，在那裏還有什麼都市？我像是馳騁在浩渺無際的海洋裏，妳應該知道，這是對一個善良靈魂的無情的迫害！</p>
<p>我仍舊要咀嚼妳那遣棄給我的生命的殘渣，這世紀，這天地，於我是無所留戀的了；我需要故事，那是從妳口裏宣洩出來的傾訴，那將是我整個生命的豪華紀錄，我需要詩歌，那是妳譜成的飛揚的旋律，那將是我竭慕生活的永恒的節奏！</p>
<p>我己忘懷了幾月的歡樂與哀愁，像一個倦怠的征途旅客向驛站跋涉，等待着妳給我的「明天」！</p>
<p>妳忍心使一個無罪的戀情迷惘地呻吟在泥淖裏嗎，我懇切的問妳。</p>

<h3>一寸山河一寸血　131</h3>
<p>— 葉勁風</p>
<p>鶴見預計這天晚上，就要到近衛別府裏去，搜尋「七封秘緘」，所以一抵安坂鷄場，立刻呌野猪趁這天才剛剛破曉的當口，趕到東京市內，命令〇十二號，動員所有人才，準備候令行動；命令圓子佈置內應工作，每隔一二小時，供給關於別府的情報一次，午前情報，可以彙集起來，由野猪送來；午後情報，按時由〇十二傳達安坂。另外，又呌野猪傳令「〇三」和「〇十一」，這一正一副兩位行動指揮，在下午一時以前，趕到安坂鷄場來，聽取計劃，接受行動命令。關於華方長辛店行動總部以後的工作動向，呌野猪轉令「〇十二」照情報上的批請辦理。</p>
<p>野猪去後，鶴見在安坂處休息到九點半鐘模樣，一部車子，趕到東京市內，到公寓裏，換了等級制服，跑到參謀總部，晋謁自己的頂頭上司，說明即日必須趕回大陸；順便打聽軍用飛機航駛的地點，班次，時間。看那軍用機最後一班，乃是下午九點鐘，便決定　乘這一班飛機動身，並向上司，照例請示了一回，吿辭出來。</p>
<p>鶴見行期已定，便上掛名「××俱樂部」的黑龍會行動總部，參見了幾位駐會執行常委，虛如委蛇般，叨敎了些今後的行動方金。鶴見是在職人員，並不參加本地行動，所以常委們只說了些努力報國，忠心會務的官話，又問了幾句請於鶴見今後動向的事，就算了却一番手續。鶴見在會裏，打了幾個吿辭的電話，一個是給鶴見淸，一個是給萍子。</p>
<p>鶴見忙了兩小時，把秘密計劃中，應行安排的節目，一一做到，這才忽忽趕回安坂鷄場。</p>
<p>鶴見旣是東京各秘密團社注意的人物，他這幾小時的行動，難道就沒有人監視追踪？不能沒有！請　這天午報上。就有這麼一段，題目是「飛來飛去，行　飄忽…；小要人鶴見玉四大陸行！」一行小題是「再度出征，英雄出少年！…晚班皇軍御用飛行機首途，晚九時啟行，謹祝勝利以馬斯…！」</p>
<p>鶴見飛回大陸的消息，旣已被人探聽了去，照理，就應該有人跟踪他到安坂鷄塲來，不是嗎？這却有些難得辦到：因爲鶴見這時的行動，都是有計劃的；換句話說，他願意人知道的，就故意露出行藏來，那不願人知道的一部分，當然運用了操奇制勝的方法解脫了。</p>
<p>况且，這時講究運用神機，足以與鶴見頡頑的，僅有一般第五縱隊。然而第五縱隊，却要受近衛的節制。自從前天晚上，近衛這老傢伙，對着鶴見弄了那一套手法，以爲已把鶴見這匹劣駒，收伏下來了，所以並不十分注意他的行動了。那第五縱隊這些獵犬，看見主人放髤，當然也不去多事了。</p>
<p>鶴見趕回安坂鷄塲的時候，早有三個人在那裏候着；一個是野豬，一個是〇三號，還有一個是〇十一號。</p>
<p>〇三號，上野文淸，是個通訊社的攝影記者，十六歲從公立野兒院驅逐出來之後，在國內流浪了四年，後來經琉球，合灣，新嘉坡，印度，等處到歐洲各地，一路做着游行丐，前後十年。回到本土已經成了一個極有能耐的攝影記者，問時又是一個某種特殊秘密團社的社員。有人猜這秘密團社，就是急進派的無政府主義。他和鶴見認　，乃是由于安坂的居間介紹。</p>

<h3>聖誕</h3>
<p>— 少夫</p>
<p>呵天使唱高聲，報知耶穌今降生；</p>
<p>天上榮光歸眞主，地下平安人豪恩。</p>
<p>這個歌聲今天將彌浚於全世界各個角落了。即使是非基督徒，　到　個歌　，也將感到一絲溫暖而歡欣鼓舞罷！</p>
<p>據聖經上說：耶穌是生在伯利恒城的一個馬　裏，這一個卑微的地方，却誕生了最崇高的人物，我們印證耶穌以後所說的「凡自高者必降卑」，很可以說明出身卑微並不足以限制一個人的成就。</p>
<p>習俗上每逢此日，有聖誕老人背負着一隻沉重的大襪桶，裏　面裝滿了各色各樣的禮物，從烟內裏走下來，分訪每一人家。</p>
<p>襪桶裏所裝的禮品，現在都變成了糖果，餅乾，玩具，甚至日用雜貨了，離然切合人情，很實際，但未免太傖俗了。據我們想，傳說中那隻襪桶，也許是表示無限希望之意；從烟囪下來，在說明溫暖；而白髪白鬚老人則代表慈祥。</p>
<p>前幾天，美國新聞處紐約電，說今年各公司商店的廣吿，畫着聖誕老人乘飛機了，他的禮品則由降落傘拋擲下來，似乎在進步。我們讀了這則消息，老實說；有些毛髮悚然，因爲那股殺伐氣將完全驅走了我們這一絲絲人間的喜悅罷。</p>
<h3>倒風襲到我家裏</h3>
<p>— 阿惠</p>
<p>近幾個月來，家裏的小菜每况愈下，大不如前了，我想大的是菜蔬貴了的關係。這且不談，一個月前，我太太忽然問我要零用錢，我知道太太很節省，不看戲，不打牌，又捨不得吃，手裏由伙食裏壓下些私房錢，也總有個四五十萬，她　放利息都不放心，這些錢用到什麼地方去了，到使我很奇怪一</p>
<p>後來她吿訴我，她入了三脚　會，每脚十萬元：</p>
<p>「明年四月裏都可到會，每脚可收一百五十萬，三脚四百五十萬，你想，差不多五百萬，你要掙上幾年哩！一</p>
<p>我笑笑，她興緻濃得很，我不去掃她的興，不過，每月應解的會踐如果要在伙食裏打算盤，找自己到沒有什麼，孩子們吃不　，到是件不忍的事，所以我對她說：每月的會錢我勉强凑起來，對伙食上再不要尅扣。再吿訴　，以後如果有什麼標會，不能再加人，否則，祇得全家餓肚子了。</p>
<p>「你放心，五百萬，明春可有五百萬，不是很够了嗎？」</p>
<p>我笑笑，五百萬，引誘力眞不小。</p>
<p>大前大回家，太太臉色很不好看，前大回家，她坐在房裏發呆，連晚飯都不曾燒，孩子們說中飯都不曾吃，祇吃了些餅干，媽媽一直坐在那裏，小的嚇得哭　。</p>
<p>我知道是「標會」出了毛病，她給我一問，撲在牀上突起來了，我笑着安慰她說：</p>
<p>「算了，還有三百萬，不還是個大歟目嗎？」</p>
<p>她鳴咽着回答我說，前天，昨天倒了二脚，還有一脚也有點　不住。</p>
<p>我一面安慰她說，孩子們要緊，將來長大了，五百萬一千萬算什麼，呌她立刻去燒晚飯；一面自己心裏到鬆了下來，每月的會錢可不必「傷腦筋」去東凑西拼了。</p>
<p>昨人回家，菜比往常好，孩子們很熱鬧地吃着飯，太太低了頭，不曾開口。</p>
<p>臨睡的時候，她平靜地吿訴我：</p>
<p>「最後一脚也倒了。」</p>
<h3>爲怕苛捐雜稅　反對市縣劃界</h3>
<p>— 亢石</p>
<p>十九日本報，載着一篇「閔行的通訊」，爲了上海市縣劃界的問題，內政部視察程景等蒞閔視察，當地各團體及民衆一致主張保留縣治，竟至結隊請願，張貼標語，大呼口號．倒也是値得一談的問題！</p>
<p>筆者曾於夏秋之間，返閔數次，對上海市縣劃界的事，徼有所聞，據傳上海縣屬之閔行三林等鄕，劃入上海市之說，早已於今春醞釀甚盛．這一次內政部視察等蒞閔，正爲了這問題，所以當時各團體及民衆請願保留縣洽，反對劃入市區。</p>
<p>依客觀的眼光，縣升爲市，於交通建設等方面，自富逐漸推進，實爲地方之幸，而該地民衆却反而請願保留縣治，反對劃入市區，其故安在？實因劃在縣區之內，不論各種捐稅，較市區輕薄，如果一旦劃入市區，則各項捐稅，自當與市區一視同仁，即使與市區相差减低？亦必較縣區爲高，所以羣情都恐慌起來了，於是請願，貼標語，呼口號，以求保留縣治也！</p>
<p>筆者以故鄉所在，較爲明晰閔行的商情，並且感到茲事體大，不覺有所感觸查自勝利以還！，百業凋零，閔行的商店，因農民購買力一蹶不振，遂致各商號實銷無力，如果一劃入市區，所有營業捐，市政捐等等必致相率增加，在這商情困敝之日，怎不呌人不起恐慌呢？</p>
<p>所以筆者以人民利弊的所在，把民情民隱，希望當局統盤的籌劃，使行政與人民兩得其便，那才是「洽理之幸」了</p>
<h3>唐僧遇騙</h3>
<p>— 建</p>
<p>白克路××烟號，老闆姓唐，因爲他吃素信佛，本性忠厚，所以人都呌他唐僧。店中雇用三個夥計，一個練習生，小本經營，省吃儉用，營業日見發展。近來有一年的十五六歲模樣的學徒，時來購買香烟，如見店夥們工作不忙，常喜閑談取笑，店夥們因爲是常見的熟客，不使對他冷淡，也時興憲喧。</p>
<p>一天早晨，牌門開得不多時　，這學徒手携小提箱一隻，急急地走來，從衣袋中摸出八萬元一張當日××銀行的支票，對店擊們優：「昨晚接瀉家中快信，謂父親病很危險，　即回家，刻向店東支取兩個月薪水，以便　用，不料店中缺乏現鈔，簽此當日支　　呌我前往　用，但　　銀行尙未開門　而且此去路又不近，加之回家的輪船，開駛時間將　，可吾帮帮我忙，掉換現鈔。」並把支票授給一夥友，以明非價。</p>
<p>可是烟號夥計，都屬精明幹練，深知現在空頭支粟，流行巾面，受　的人，時有所聞，因此一口拒絕，不能照辦，並將支票隨手交還。該學徒接票後，略一遲疑說：『那末我只好目己去界了，不過提箱一隻，來回累　，務必帮帮忙，暫奇一寄，一小時內，即來領取。』語時把箱提上櫃台。這時唐僧已從樓上下來，見這學徒可憐情形，便答應他的要求，當由一許姓夥計，順手把箱放入櫃內地上，談學徒稱謝不置，匆匆作別而去。</p>
<p>這天，學徒一去不來，在第二天的旁晚，忽有兩個冒牌軍警裝束的人，來問學徒寄箱事件。據說：「該學徒並非學徒，而是强盜，名呌李彪，現經拘獲究詢，供出唐老闆是他的同黨，有小提箱一隻，內藏手槍，現存店中，」云云。唐僧聞言之下，　惶萬狀，說明寄箱情形，竭力剖白，同時交出提箱，撬開查看，內儲破衣數襲，並無手槍，惟箱蓋裏面，貼有李彪名片一張。當時來人聲勢汹汹，謂唐必是同黨，非交出手槍並拘辦不可。這時店夥們主張報　，而唐僧不願多事，但願和平了結。結果，奉獻二十萬元，一場風波，始行平息。可知上海灘上，好人眞不易做也。</p>

<h3>房子何用</h3>
<p>— 蔡雪</p>
<p>地產商人向一摩登少年兜生意。</p>
<p>少年：「我用不着貢房子。我生在醫院中，在學校裏　書，在汽車中求婚，在敎堂裏結婚，在法庭上離婚。早上在旅館中睡覺，下午在咖啡館喝茶，晚上在俱樂部過夜。將來死了，在殯儀館入殮。我只要有一汽車間便足够了。」</p>

<h3>綁匪內幕</h3>
<p>— 建華</p>
<p>綁票匪　屬盜　的變相，但是他們的確有着嚴密的組織，雄厚的資本。如化裝車夫，　司，娘姨等，選擇，當有人家，預先埋伏。暗通消息；如汽車天，槍乎·看票等人物的物色和豢養；又如汽車。手槍，藏票處等的置備或租借；均須由一首領，設計·指揮，及　本。不過上述數點，並不是綁匪的難問題。只要苜領頭寸靈活，同黨人才集中。不難迎刃而解，擇肥而噬了。</p>
<p>最後一</p>
<p>他們最難的一個關口，就是把　綁到以後，談妥　數，而要去接收　款的最後一關。因爲　架的時候，是乘人不備，一種突擊的秘密行動，大都不會臨陣失風。至於接洽　款，是利用電話或通信，也是問接行動，不愁破案的。惟有接收　款，必須指定地點，派人往取，這種亳無掩蔽的露骨行動，往往功虧一簣，有全體落　的危險。</p>
<p>因此，他們用盡心思，周密設計，有「鑽刀　」。「釣金魚」。「捉垃圾」。等的方法，務使打破　關，贖款到手。例如事主接到匪方　　信件之後，尙在觀望不決，或有報警趨勢的時候，他們自有　綫通知，索性來一個單刀直人，假裝警局人員，直入被綁人家，說明你們綁案，己被警局偵悉，眞其爲何不報，私自料理，並　　贖票地點和贖票金額，囑他們備全款子屆期同往拘捕，期內須守秘密，勿令匪徒知悉等語。假使事主深信不疑，那麼到了交款時期，仍派前人化裝車夫，拉交款人前往的定地點，實行其交接手續，　呌做「鑽刀圈」。萬一這　計劃，被對方識破，他們再用撕票來威脅，另行別種方法</p>
<p>釣金魚</p>
<p>所謂「釣金魚」者，是匪徒通知被綁人家，呌他們將金條封入布袋，丟入某段黃浦江中的　計。這方法是容易明瞭的，他們的要旨，務使警局人員，難於應付，金條投人浦江之後，黨中自右「水老鼠」潛往撈取，但撈取的時間，却無從捉摸，水底不比地面，不能長期守候，所以也最難緝捕。</p>
<p>前有××警局，　到　主報吿，謂匪方約定某日某時，把贖款拿到××里，投入垃圾箱內，（該里只有垃圾　一隻）請求拘捕云云。屆時警員晴伏四周，預備，中捉　，等到事主將款投人以後，久　動靜，不見有人前來取款，警員們耐無可耐，　視之下，垃圾桶內句一紥的贖款，己不翼而飛，詳細觀察，始知一家牆　與垃圾箱，貫穿一洞，儘可在室內摸取箱內的東西。結果，巡家的二房東，拘局究罰，而綁匪早己捉到「特別垃圾」，人去室空了。</p>

<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 23rd] It is learned that the Constitutional Draft's third reading is expected to be completed during the 19th session, scheduled for the afternoon of the 24th. Therefore, the National Assembly can hold its closing ceremony on the morning of the 25th, a historical memorial day.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 23rd] National Assembly Chairman Chiang Kai-shek convened the 27th meeting at 11:00 AM on the 23rd. The resolutions are as follows: (1) The draft preparation procedures for the implementation of the Constitution, which were decided to be eleven articles at the meeting on the 22nd, had the first and second articles merged at the meeting on the 23rd, resulting in a proposed nine articles. (2) The list of members of the drafting committee for the Emergency Law resolution was determined, totaling twelve people. (3) Sun Ke presided over the 17th General Assembly. In the afternoon, the Presidium held its 28th meeting, chaired by Hu Shuhua. The resolutions are as follows: (1) The General Assembly is postponed for one day and will close on the 25th. (2) General Assemblies will be held on the 24th, both morning and afternoon. (3) The 18th General Assembly will be held at 9:00 AM on the 24th, chaired by Kong Xiangxi.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 23rd] At the Central Memorial Week on the 23rd, Chairman Chiang raised two points regarding the articles of the Constitution that had already been passed in the second reading, hoping that all representatives would carefully consider them. (1) The 28th article, passed yesterday, stating that "incumbent officials may not be elected as National Assembly representatives," is considered to deprive officials of their own civil rights. He hopes that all representatives will carefully consider and propose an amendment. (2) Regarding the allocation of seats for legislators in Article 65, if the number passed is followed, it will reach over seven hundred people, making it difficult to convene meetings. He also hopes that this can be carefully studied. It is heard that some representatives have also felt this way for some time and plan to propose an amendment within the next few days for further discussion. A decision may be made at the General Assembly on the 24th.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 23rd] The Central Memorial Week was held at 8:30 AM on the 23rd in the National Government Auditorium. Chairman Chiang personally attended and delivered a speech, encouraging the Kuomintang National Assembly representatives to work hard to complete the constitutional task. The Chairman stated: The second session of the National Assembly is about to be completed. After the third reading, the constitutional work will be completed. This constitutional drafting is the most important task in history, and it is a great honor for everyone to participate in this great work. The Chairman also stated: Since the opening of the National Assembly, nearly forty days have passed. Comrades of our party and representatives of various parties have gathered together to exchange opinions and discuss together. This kind of democratic spirit has achieved great success. He hopes that everyone will maintain this spirit in the future, and our party will never fail. The Chairman pointed out that Article 65 of the Constitutional Draft stipulates that the number of legislators should be more than 700, which is too many and will make it difficult to hold meetings in the future. Furthermore, the 28th article passed yesterday stipulates that incumbent officials may not be elected as National Assembly representatives, which may also be difficult in practice and it would be best to have some remedy. The Chairman continued to praise that all representatives have been able to fulfill their responsibilities in the constitutional work, which has led to such satisfactory results and is a success for our party. He also stated: Now that the National Assembly is about to close, everyone will return to their original places. He hopes that everyone will continue to work hard with the spirit they had during the meeting. This spirit is that before a resolution, there is open discussion, and after a resolution, it must be strictly followed. The Chairman's speech lasted half an hour.</p>
<h3>The Constitutional Draft's Second Reading is Rapid; May Be Completed in Full Today; This Morning's General Assembly Read to Article 109</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 23rd] The second reading of the Constitution is progressing rapidly. During the 16th session of the National Assembly today, the morning session read from Article 83 to Article 109. During the 17th General Assembly in the afternoon, it read from Article 110 to Article 139. Except for a few clauses that were amended, all the rest were passed. It is expected that the second reading of the Constitutional Draft will be fully completed during the 18th General Assembly on the 24th.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 23rd] The 16th session of the National Assembly was held at 10:00 AM on the 23rd. At the beginning of the meeting, there were 1,244 representatives present, which later increased to 1,478. Chairman Gu Zhenggang reported on the minutes of the 15th meeting. Then, KMT representative Xie Chengping spoke, requesting that the assembly and the chairman pay attention to the rules of procedure and not allow one person's temporary proposition to affect the meeting's progress. Then, the second reading procedure continued, starting with Article 83, "Judicial," of the seventh chapter. Representative Zhu Songsou and 34 others proposed an amendment to this article, advocating maintaining the original draft's order and wording of this article, so that the powers of the Grand Justices, in addition to interpreting the Constitution and unifying the interpretation of laws and regulations, can also concurrently handle trials. Representative Jiang Yiping, the convener of the Fourth Review Committee, then spoke to explain that the Grand Justices are authorities on law, not judges of the Supreme Court, and should not have too many members. Their powers are not limited to the current definition in Article 86 (new Article 83), and whether they concurrently handle trials is not necessarily fixed. Representative Song Qiao also expressed his agreement, believing that the Grand Justices' handling of trials should not be rigidly stipulated. After voting, only 317 votes were in favor of the amendment, and the original text was maintained with 1,026 votes. Article 84 was passed without objection. After this article, Representative Chen Changheng and 36 others proposed a supplementary motion to add an article: "The Judicial Yuan may submit legal bills to the Legislative Yuan regarding matters under its jurisdiction." After Chen explained the reason, Representative Chen Qitian spoke against it, saying that the judicial organ should not draft laws, and the judicial administration power belongs to the Executive Yuan according to Article 82. The organization law of courts at all levels does not need to be proposed by the Judicial Yuan. Furthermore, the spirit of the original draft is to make the Judicial Yuan the highest judicial organ, equal and independent of the Legislative Yuan. If it submits legal bills to the Legislative Yuan, it would change this principle and make the Judicial Yuan responsible to the Legislative Yuan. After voting, only 245 votes were in favor of the supplementary motion, and the original proposal was maintained. Regarding the guarantee of judges' duties in Article 85, representatives raised complaints about the suffering of the people from the corrupt judicial system, arguing that there should be provisions for removing protection for corrupt judges. After voting, the original text was maintained with 1,109 votes. Article 86 was passed without objection. However, Representative Ni Bi spoke, saying that he opposed the Judicial Yuan's sole interpretation of the Constitution and requested to reserve the right to speak, to raise this point again when Article 149 is discussed. Article 87 was passed without objection. Chapter 8, "Examination": Articles 88 to 94, a total of seven articles, were all passed without objection. Only Article 90 had an amendment proposed by Representative Bu Wenlin and 18 others. Due to insufficient statutory numbers, Bu also gave up speaking, and it was not discussed.</p>
<p>Chapter 9, "Control": Article 95 was passed without objection. Article 96, regarding the number of Control Yuan members to be elected, stirred up a storm. This article had six amendments: (1) Representative Yao Qinru and 46 others proposed that the allocation of Control Yuan members in each province and region should also adopt a population proportion system, advocating modifying the first paragraph to: "Provinces and cities with a population of less than 5 million shall have 5 members. Those with a population of over 5 million shall elect one additional member for every 5 million people." (2) Representative Zhao Bingqi and others proposed that each province should elect at least 5 Control Yuan members. (3) Representative Bei Zairan and 33 others proposed that the first paragraph should be modified to: "Each province shall have 5 to 7 members." (4) Representative Fu Sinian and 37 others proposed that the standard of 5 members per province after the division of provinces and regions would cause the Control Yuan to have too many people, making work difficult. They advocated reducing the number, modifying the first paragraph to: "Each province shall have 3 members." (5) Representative Wang Xiaolai and 35 others proposed that the second paragraph be modified to: "Each directly administered municipality shall have 5 members." (6) Representative Ba Wenjun and 31 others proposed that, in addition to leagues, Mongolia also has independent banners not affiliated with leagues, advocating modifying the third paragraph to: "The Mongolian leagues (adding one character) banners shall have a total of eight members." After the amendments were read, Representative Jiang Yiping, the convener of the Fourth Review Committee, explained that the target of the Control Yuan's control is officials, and the number of officials in each province is the same, so the number of members should also be the same. Representative Chen Qitian, the convener of the Comprehensive Review Committee, continued to explain that the committee decided that the standard of 5 people is an appropriate number, and the Legislative Yuan has already stipulated the number according to population proportion, so the Control Yuan should continue to maintain the balance of each province. Then, the representatives who advocated amendment spoke. Representative Ni Mifang elaborated on the reasons. Several representatives downstairs had a dispute over whether to discuss or not, arguing and shouting angrily at each other: "Fight! Fight!" The order was chaotic for a while. Chairman Gu then urgently struck the gavel twice to suppress the order of the meeting. According to the rules of procedure, he announced the end of the discussion and put it to a vote amidst the opposition of some representatives. As a result, regarding the first paragraph, in addition to proposal (2) by Representative Zhao and others maintaining the original proposal and proposal (4) by Representative Fu and others having been automatically withdrawn, proposal (1) by Representative Yao and others only received 457 votes. Proposal (3) by Representative Bei and others only received 312 votes and were rejected. The first paragraph still maintained the original text with an absolute majority of 1,026 votes. In the second paragraph, proposal (5) by Representative Wang and others was also rejected with a minority of 131 votes, maintaining the original text. In the third and fourth paragraphs, the convener of the Comprehensive Review Committee made a written statement, stating that the character "clan" was an unintentional omission. The amendment by Representative Ba and others was passed without objection. The entire text was passed with 1,201 votes after adding a "banner" character to the third paragraph. At this point, it was 11:10 AM. After a break, the meeting continued at 11:30 AM. The number of representatives present decreased to 1,250. Article 97 was passed without objection. Article 98 had an amendment proposed by Representative Duan Binglin and 44 others, advocating reducing the term of Control Yuan members to three years to match the term of legislators. After voting, it received 428 votes, and the original text was maintained with 704 votes. Article 99 was passed without objection. After this article, Representative Chen Changheng and 35 others proposed a supplementary motion to add an article: "The Control Yuan may submit legal bills to the Legislative Yuan regarding matters under its jurisdiction." After voting, it was rejected with a minority of 490 votes. Articles 100 to 106, a total of seven articles, were passed without objection. Article 107 had three amendments proposed by Representative Li Cizong and 36 others, Representative Liu Ke and Representative Lou Tongsun and 33 others, and Representative Gao Yihan and 34 others. Their content was the same, all proposing to amend the article to: "Control Yuan members, except for current offenders (deleting "and those who have been prosecuted" six characters), may not be arrested or detained without the permission of the Control Yuan." After the amendment was announced, Representative Li Zhongli, the convener of the Fourth Review Committee, stated that the provisions for the protection of Control Yuan members in Article 107 should be the same as those for legislators in Article 79. After voting, the amendment was passed with 994 votes. Articles 108 and 109 were passed without objection. It was already 12:00 noon. Chairman Gu stated that the Presidium originally planned to complete the second reading on the same day and proposed to extend the meeting by half an hour, but the proposal was rejected by the assembly. Secretary-General Hong then reported that the meeting would be held at 3:00 PM in the afternoon and adjourned the meeting.</p>

<h3>Striving to Complete a Democratic Constitution; Ambassador Stuart Praises Chairman Chiang; Hopes That Our Countrymen Will Jointly Avert the Economic Crisis</h3>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 23rd] Ambassador Stuart entered the city at 9:00 AM on the 23rd to visit relevant parties. At noon, he attended a banquet hosted by American Consul Myers. He returned to the school in the afternoon and attended a meeting of faculty and students at Yenching University at 4:20 PM, giving a speech. At 5:00 PM, he met and talked with Zhang Dongsun.

<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 23rd] At the faculty and student meeting at Yenching University on the 23rd, Ambassador Stuart expressed his deep appreciation for Chairman Chiang's efforts to complete the democratic constitution and called on the Chinese people to jointly devote themselves to the implementation of this constitution. He also said that current prices are high, and the people are struggling to make a living. China's economy is on the verge of collapse. If it is not saved in time, the future is unimaginable. Under this situation, patriots should unite and replace destructive efforts with a constructive spirit to engage in the construction of a new China. Ambassador Stuart also talked about China's difficulties, saying that most of them are due to disharmony in human relationships. Finally, he sincerely prayed that China would be able to make significant progress next year.</p>
<h3>Chairman Invites Ambassador Marshall to Spend Christmas Eve Together</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 23rd] Special Envoy Marshall will be invited by Chairman Chiang and his wife to spend his Christmas Eve at the Chairman's residence on the evening of the 24th. Furthermore, Zhou Qianchong, a standing committee member of the Youth Party, recently visited Special Envoy Marshall twice and had discussions, exchanging views on the current situation.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 23rd] A spokesperson for the American Embassy told reporters on the 23rd that Special Envoy Marshall currently has no plans to leave China. The so-called Marshal Marshall will return to the country before the end of the year is absolutely unreliable.</p>
<h3>Sun Ke, Hu Shi, and Twelve Others Draft Resolutions of the Constitutional Draft; General Assembly in the Afternoon Reads to Article 139</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 23rd] The 17th session of the National Assembly was held at 3:30 PM on the 23rd, with 1,050 people present. Chairman Sun Ke, after performing the formalities, in addition to the Secretariat announcing the minutes of the 16th meeting, Secretary-General Hong Lanyou also reported the list of members of the drafting committee for the Constitutional Draft resolutions, totaling twelve people. The list is as follows: Sun Ke, Hu Shi, Zuo Shunsheng, Chen Qitian, Wang Chonghui, Wang Shijie, Pan Gongzhan, Lin Bin, Jiang Yuntian, Chen Cheng, Hong Lanyou, Lei Zhen. The second reading then continued, starting with Article 110, and discussing until Article 139 by 6:00 PM, all passed, with slight amendments. The discussion process is recorded as follows: In Article 110, the fifth paragraph was "National highways, national railways, national roads, and shipping administration, postal administration, and telecommunications administration." Ling Hongxun believed that national highways and national roads were the same thing, and there was repetition in the text. It should be amended to remove the four characters "national roads." After voting, it was passed. The rest was passed according to the amendment. Article 111 had amendment opinions from Xue Peiyuan, believing that after the twelfth item in this article, an item on land use law should be added, and after the eighteenth item, an item on property law should be added. After voting, it was a minority and was rejected. Furthermore, Leng Shaoquan and others suggested that the third item, agriculture, forestry, industry, and commerce, be changed to "forests, industry, and commerce," and the sixth item, shipping and coastal fishing, be changed to "shipping and marine fishing." The tenth item, water conservancy and canals above two provinces, was changed to "water conservancy and river canals above two provinces, and joint agricultural and pastoral methods." After voting, the amendment was passed by a majority. Leng Shaoquan's amendment opinion on Article 121 was to amend the sixth item, "provincial agriculture, forestry, water conservancy, animal husbandry, and engineering," to "provincial agriculture, forestry, water conservancy, fisheries, animal husbandry, and engineering," which was immediately passed. Furthermore, in the article added after Article 120, Leng Shaoquan's amendment opinion was to change the fifth item to "county agriculture, forestry, water conservancy, fisheries, animal husbandry, and engineering," which was passed. Next, Articles 113 to 120 were all passed without objection. Two articles were added after Article 120, one was "The autonomy system of the Mongolian leagues and tribes shall be determined by law," passed without objection. The second was "The autonomy system of Tibet shall be guaranteed." Chairman Chiang had previously announced that the two characters "local" would be removed, which was immediately passed. Then, starting with Article "1111," the entire section on counties was passed without objection. Chapter 12, "Election, Recall, Initiative, Referendum," Articles "129" and "130" were passed according to the original text. Article "131" had an amendment opinion from Qin Liankui, changing the wording of the article "Elections should strictly prohibit threats and enticements. If there are election lawsuits, they must be submitted to the court for trial," where "must be submitted" should be changed to "by." Qin Liankui explained the reason, saying: Litigations are filed with the court. If it is said "must be submitted," then it is submitted to other agencies. After this turn, it will take more time. At the same time, during the tutelage period, election lawsuits were tried by the court. Now, suddenly saying "must be submitted" seems like they were not tried by the court in the past, which will cause misunderstanding. If it is changed to "by" the court for trial, it will be straightforward and clear. After voting, it was passed by a majority. Then, Article "132" was discussed and passed according to the original article. [To be continued]</p>
<h3>Communist Troops Harassing the Outskirts of Beiping Have Been Defeated</h3>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 23rd] The Communist troops harassing Pingnan were defeated on the 22nd. Several units fled along the Yongding River. One unit of over 700 people attacked the Weishanzhuang military station between Beiping and Tianjin on the night of the 22nd. Another unit crossed the railway and fled towards Wu Ji.</p>
<p>[United Press, Beiping, 23rd] It is learned that Communist troops are constantly attacking the outskirts of Beiping. Yesterday, they attacked the Mentougou coal mine, 16 miles west of Beiping, but were repelled.</p>
<h3>Sun Lianzhong Returns to Beiping from Baoding; Main Force of Communist Troops Northwest of Baoding Defeated; National Army in Northern Jiangsu Advances to the Outskirts of Funing</h3>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 23rd] Sun Lianzhong returned to Beiping from Baoding on the 23rd. It is learned that after several days of fierce fighting between the two armies in Mancheng, northwest of Baoding, more than half of the main force of the Communist troops has been defeated. The National Army has gained an absolute advantage and is still fiercely fighting in the Xiangjiazhuang and Yangying areas.</p>
<p>[Our Taixian Dispatch, 23rd] Frontline telephone call: The National Army is advancing rapidly, and the vanguard troops have reached the outskirts of Funing, 20 li from the urban area.</p>
<h3>Minister Chen Lifu Answers Reporters' Questions; Date of Constitutional Implementation Still Under Discussion; Different Chapters May Be Implemented in Stages Due to Different Natures</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 23rd] Central Organization Minister Chen Lifu, when answering questions at a press conference of the Central Propaganda Department on the afternoon of the 23rd, said: The Chinese Kuomintang is a revolutionary party, emphasizing fulfilling obligations rather than pursuing benefits. Its nature is different from that of political parties in other countries. The Premier once cited Yi Yin's assistance to Taijia as an example, and today's situation is indeed the same.</p>
<p>The Kuomintang Spirit: Freedom and Discipline</p>
<p>Since the Kuomintang is a revolutionary party, its members are willing to sacrifice their lives to fight for anything that is beneficial to the country. The majority obeys the minority, and if the minority opinion is indeed superior to the majority, the majority can adopt it. The Kuomintang's basic spirit is freedom and discipline. Before a decision is made, there can be free discussion. After a decision is made, it must be obeyed. This spirit can be fully seen in this National Assembly. However, the majority obeying the minority is a great danger to democratic politics. Doing it once in a while is acceptable, but doing it again and again will endanger the democratic spirit. The ancients said, "Those who manage small things with great care are happy with heaven; those who manage great things with small care fear heaven," which is sufficient to explain the current situation. A reporter asked what attitude the government would take if the constitution passed by the National Assembly was opposed by the parties participating in this conference. Chen replied: The constitution to be formulated this time was formulated by the national representatives, therefore, this is not a question of what the government's attitude is, but what the people's attitude is.</p>
<p>Elections in Communist Areas Must Be Conducted in Accordance with the Constitution</p>
<p>Another reporter asked how the Communist issue would be resolved after the constitution was passed, and how representatives from the Communist areas would be elected, or whether representatives from the Communist areas were needed at all. Chen replied: The future election law will be based on the constitution, therefore, elections must be conducted in any area, unless the party does not recognize the people in its area as citizens. He believes that "any party should not obstruct the implementation of the constitution." A reporter asked, "I heard that the Communist Party asked the National Assembly to postpone its closing. Is this true?" and asked whether the Communist Party would participate, and what impact it would have if it did not participate. Chen replied: Regarding the former question, he had not heard of it. Regarding the latter, the National Assembly will close in a few days. Even if the Communist representatives come to participate, they may not be able to get here in time, unless they come here by rocket. He explained that the National Assembly has always reserved seats for Communist representatives. Their non-participation is a voluntary waiver, which will not have any impact on the future implementation of the constitution. Chen believes that the constitution is expected to be promulgated in January, but when it will be implemented is still to be discussed by the Assembly. Because the constitution has different chapters with different natures, it may need to be implemented in stages and cannot be exercised simultaneously. For example, Chapter 3, the National Assembly, may be implemented first. As for the term and tasks of the National Assembly representatives, although the task of this National Assembly is mainly to draft the constitution, it is not different from other National Assemblies because of the drafting of the constitution. Therefore, its term will also be extended until the date of the next National Assembly as stipulated in the constitution. After the closure of this National Assembly, although the task of drafting the constitution by the National Assembly representatives will be completed, they will still be responsible for publicizing and urging the implementation of the constitution as scheduled.</p>
<p>Party Affairs Meeting to Be Held After the Closure of the National Assembly</p>
<p>In addition to answering the above questions, Chen also talked about the future status of the Kuomintang. According to reports, after the constitution is promulgated and before the president is elected, the National Government will still have its legal status, because its task will not end until the handover is completed. This point is clearly stipulated in the Founding Program. After the government is reorganized, the status of the various institutions of the Central Party Headquarters will be different from the current one, but it will depend on how the government is reorganized. Chen confirmed that a party affairs meeting will indeed be held after the closure of the National Assembly, but believes that this is only to take advantage of the gathering of responsible persons from various local party headquarters to conduct a routine review of party affairs work. The rumor that a "party-government affairs committee" will be organized is unfounded. Regarding the question of how to raise the Kuomintang's party fees for the coming year, Chen replied that since this year, some of the party's undertakings have been gradually tightened, and the number of personnel in the Central Party Headquarters has been reduced by almost half, and the number of personnel in local party headquarters has also been greatly reduced. In the future, we will not make it possible to support the party by party members. Therefore, he believes that there will be no difficulty with the party fees.</p>

<h3>Martial Law in French-Controlled Areas of Vietnam; D'Argenlieu Flew Back to Saigon Yesterday; Blum Will Reiterate Compromise Policy</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Hanoi, 22nd] Martial law has been declared in the French-controlled areas of northern and southern central Vietnam. The French have used loudspeakers to summon all Vietnamese supervisory troops to their posts. It is reported that anyone without a uniform who is arrested and found to be armed will be shot, and all houses that have not raised a white flag will be searched. Any house from which shots are fired will be attacked. Meanwhile, the French Air Force is currently busy destroying Vietnamese artillery positions. It is reported that in the days of fighting in Hanoi, French casualties have exceeded two hundred. Among the Vietnamese soldiers killed, Japanese corpses have been found.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Paris, 22nd] An Associated Press dispatch from Saigon reports that fierce fighting has broken out in Hue, the capital of central Vietnam, and the conflict has spread throughout Vietnam. It is reported that most civilians have fled, but some Vietnamese remain in cities inhabited by French people. The French claim that Vietnamese forces appear to be preparing to attack Hong Gai, a coal-producing center about eighty miles east of Hanoi.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Hanoi, 23rd] French armored vehicles and infantry units have been active in the northern Vietnamese military area since this morning, with fighting taking place near the General Post Office building and the power plant. Casualties among the overseas Chinese have not yet been estimated. The Vietnamese military radio station continues to broadcast, apparently from a mobile station. The whereabouts of the Viet Minh government are unknown after its exodus. Some former pro-Japanese Vietnamese republicans have been arrested. Mr. Livry, an official of the French Overseas Administration, has been appointed mayor of Hanoi. In addition, French forces are advancing south of the city.</p>
<p>[Another dispatch] Yesterday, the French civilian casualties were 29 dead, including 11 women, and 8 wounded. At the same time, a search of the Vietnamese police station revealed that 15 overseas Chinese had been brutally murdered by Vietnamese.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Saigon, 23rd] French High Commissioner to Vietnam Admiral Thierry d'Argenlieu flew back here today.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 23rd] According to sources close to the government, when Prime Minister Blum reports on the situation in Vietnam to the National Assembly this afternoon, he will reiterate France's determination to engage with the Viet Minh government in a spirit of the broadest possible cooperation, while protecting its legacy with the utmost determination. The Prime Minister may read out the secret telegrams exchanged between the French government and Viet Minh Republic President Ho Chi Minh. After the Prime Minister's report, the Assembly may hold a public debate.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Kunming, 23rd] According to the French consulate, fighting is ongoing in the Hanoi city area, and many key Vietnamese institutions have been occupied. Ho Chi Minh's private residence and the Municipal Grand Theater have also been occupied by the French. Traffic between Hanoi and Gia Lam is still possible. French aircraft are frequently seen in the skies over Hanoi. Clashes are also taking place in Hue and Xuan An. Haiphong remains calm.</p>
<p>[Another dispatch] The conflict between the French and Vietnamese in Hanoi has affected public safety. The China National Aviation Corporation's scheduled flight to Hanoi today has been canceled and rerouted to Chongqing.</p>
<h3>American Newspapers Comment on the Far East Situation; Britain, France, and the Netherlands Face Difficulties; France is Too Weak to Maintain Military Strength in Vietnam</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, New York, 22nd] Various newspapers here today commented on the situation in the Far East, unanimously believing that Britain, France, and the Netherlands are all facing difficulties, especially France. The New York Times stated that only the Netherlands has succeeded in achieving a considerable degree of coordination and stability in the Dutch East Indies. Britain itself is currently facing a severe test. But France's policy towards Vietnam is, in effect, "unending warfare." France is too weak to maintain the military strength it needs in Vietnam. Regarding the difficult situation within China, it is difficult to be optimistic, but the Soviet Union may have reason to be pleased about this. In addition, the New York World-Telegram stated that the era when white people could develop colored Asia is coming to an end. France and the Netherlands must be aware of this. As for France, it is currently struggling under very serious political difficulties, and has not made much progress in solving the subtle problems it faces. France is currently trying to replace the French Empire with the idea of a French Union, but Vietnam is unwilling to accept this idea of a federation. British Prime Minister Attlee announced in the House of Commons that Burma should be granted independence. The Dutch Parliament also approved a plan to establish a Federation of Indonesia, still subordinate to the Dutch King. It can be seen that France's attitude cannot be compared with that of Britain and the Netherlands.</p>
<h3>Viet Nationalist Party Leaders Have Not Contacted Our Side</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Nanjing, 23rd] Regarding reports that leaders of the Vietnamese Nationalist Party are planning to form a "National Salvation Government" and intend to request mediation by China and the United States in the Vietnamese dispute, several senior Chinese government officials today denied any knowledge of this. Semi-official sources pointed out that any contact between China and any Vietnamese political group would violate the policy of the National Government, as the government hopes that France will protect the lives and property of overseas Chinese in Vietnam in accordance with the Sino-French Treaty signed in February of this year. At the same time, the Foreign Ministry spokesman told the press today that no leaders of the Vietnamese Nationalist Party in Nanjing have contacted the Chinese Foreign Ministry. The Chinese government has no diplomatic relations with the Viet Minh Republic. The Chinese consulate there is, in fact, only liaising with the Viet Minh authorities to protect overseas Chinese. Our government is greatly concerned about the safety of overseas Chinese. It is reported that Hue, the capital of central Vietnam, has fallen into the hands of the Vietnamese army. What will happen to the more than 10,000 overseas Chinese there? We have not yet received a report. This morning, newspapers here expressed deep concern about the safety of large numbers of overseas Chinese in Vietnam and the peace and order of the Sino-Vietnamese border, and urged the French and Vietnamese authorities to stop the expansion of the conflict and restore peace and tranquility in Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Nanjing, 23rd] It has not yet been confirmed whether French Colonial Minister Moutet will come to Nanjing. However, it is stated that if the French side makes this decision, it will be welcomed by the Chinese government.</p>
<h3>The Case of Wang Shuixiang's Tragic Death: Can it Really End Without a Resolution?</h3>
<p>The Accused Police Officer Has Already Been Restored to Freedom</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Hong Kong, 23rd] The case of Wang Shuixiang being kicked to death has not yet been scheduled for retrial. The suspected police officer, Lin Xingji, has been released on bail of 100 yuan and has been restored to freedom. It is said that the prosecution may withdraw the case due to a lack of sufficient evidence. Wang Shuixiang's mother hosted the Hong Kong press on the 23rd, appealing for justice for the deceased.</p>
<h3>Two Saigon Newspapers Ordered to Cease Publication</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Saigon, 23rd] "The New Era Daily" here was closed yesterday for publishing words that "incited the people to armed rebellion." "The News Daily" was also ordered to cease publication for publishing "malicious words."</p>

<h3>The Border Between Andong and North Korea is Peaceful; Friendly Relations Maintained Between China and the Soviet Union; Ownership of the Shuifeng Plant Will Be Negotiated</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Shenyang, 22nd] Andong has recently gradually become the central area for direct Sino-Soviet military and political negotiations in the Northeast, which has attracted much attention. On the 21st, when the reporter was in Andong, the Soviet military authorities in North Korea sent a letter to the Andong military authorities, informing them that a plane from Pyongyang had mistakenly landed in Pinggui, and they had helped it to fly back. Our side replied with a letter of thanks. At the same time, the Soviet side had previously agreed that both sides should avoid shooting at each other. This may refer to the fact that when our army first arrived in Andong, shots were fired aimlessly from the opposite bank. For more than fifty days, both sides have been able to maintain friendship and tranquility. However, recently the Soviet side seems to be avoiding too close contact with us. When Qu Kai, the Deputy Commander of our Garrison, intended to visit Korea, the Soviet side politely declined, saying that the senior officer was ill and that any matters could be notified in writing. There are currently 1,750 Koreans in Andong, but they cannot be repatriated because they are registered in North Korea. At the same time, people still cross the Yalu River at night illegally. We have captured several people who said that they came here because they could not bear the oppression. The actual situation is unknown. It was previously rumored that about 20,000 Communist troops had retreated from Andong to Sinuiju, but it is said that there were actually only 500 or 600 people, mostly Communist administrative personnel. Also, regarding the request to evacuate the dozen or so Soviet troops stationed at Lagu Outpost on our bank of the Yalu River, more than a hundred miles northeast of Andong City, the Soviet side said that it would decide after consulting with higher authorities. Lagu Outpost is the location of the Shuifeng Dam. Andong City is currently supplied with 3,000 kilowatts of electricity daily from Shuifeng, and it will soon be increased by 2,000 kilowatts, but this is exchanged for food. It is reported that our electricity authorities in Changchun have obtained the Shuifeng contract signed by Manchukuo and Korea in the 26th year of the Republic of China. The ownership of the Shuifeng plant is half each for Manchukuo and Korea, and the validity period is 35 years. Our diplomatic authorities will negotiate with the Soviet Union based on this contract.</p>
<h3>The Soviet Garrison Authorities in Dalian Refuse American Reporters to Land; American Boat Warned for Exceeding Anchorage Time Limit</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, From this port] American reporter Newton telegraphed from Dalian that a US Navy landing craft, carrying a diplomatic courier and supplies for the US Consulate in Dalian, arrived in Dalian on the 18th of this month. It was allowed to anchor for 48 hours, but because it exceeded the time limit by two hours, the Soviet military authorities issued a "verbal ultimatum," and the boat left Dalian Harbor on the 20th. In addition to one diplomatic courier, there was also a representative of Mobil Oil, Paul, and two journalists. However, the Soviet authorities had not been notified of these three people beforehand. Therefore, after the boat docked in Dalian on the 18th, the Soviet side only allowed it to anchor for 48 hours and allowed the US naval officer and the diplomatic courier to disembark. Paul and the two reporters were not allowed to land. The US Consul General in Dalian, Penning Holf, applied to the Soviet military commander, Major General Kochernov, to allow them to land, but the commander sent his adjutant to the US landing craft and told them that "if you do not leave Dalian Harbor within 20 minutes, we will not be responsible for the consequences." At that time, the boat had exceeded the time limit by two hours. The boat captain, White, and the diplomatic courier, Powell, were still waiting for the Consul General's negotiation results at the Consulate General. They hurried back to the boat and immediately set sail to leave the port. Regarding the fact that the three were not allowed to land, the US Consul General in Dalian, Penning Holf, had previously negotiated with the Soviet Consul General in Dalian, Petrov. According to the Soviet Consul General, this matter must be applied for with the Soviet garrison authorities, but to allow them to land, it must be requested from Moscow first. As a result, it was not achieved.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 23rd] The State Department declined to comment on the report from Dalian that Soviet officials there had verbally delivered an ultimatum to an American ship.</p>

<h3>Flying Clothes for Winter; Marshal Ma Does His Best to Help; The Executive Yuan Relief Administration Will Send Personnel to Communist Areas</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Peiping, 23rd] The North China Branch of the Executive Yuan Relief Administration was ordered to airlift over 1,200 tons of emergency clothing to the Communist areas of western and southern Hebei, requiring 80 planes to transport it four times. Although it was scheduled to be handled in early January, the branch has not yet signed a lease agreement with the US military authorities stationed in Tianjin due to some technical issues. When Marshall visited Tianjin last time, he expressed his willingness to do his best to help the Executive Yuan Relief Administration in this endeavor, so only gasoline costs would be charged. The branch is discussing distribution technology problems with Huang Hua, the Communist Party person in charge of the military, and in principle, the Executive Yuan Relief Administration will still send working teams to the Communist areas to personally handle the distribution.</p>
<h3>Rebar Ordered for the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Chongqing, 23rd] The Chengdu-Chongqing Railway Engineering Bureau recently ordered more than 60 tons of rebar under one inch from the Southwest Office of the Resources Supply Bureau of the Executive Yuan, at a cost of more than 1.1 million yuan per ton. This batch of rebar will be transported to the construction site for use in the near future.</p>
<h3>A Bloodshed Incident Occurred in Suzhou; Conflict Between Wounded Soldiers and City Defense Troops; Trouble Arising from Accumulated Resentment Due to Lack of Tickets for Watching a Play</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Suzhou, 23rd] A major bloodshed incident occurred in Suzhou today. It was a tragedy caused by mutual fighting between city defense troops and wounded soldiers from the No. 102 Rear Hospital. Both sides suffered heavy casualties. The reporter of this newspaper rushed to the conflict area to investigate the truth at the time of the incident. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Gunfire at the Theater: At about 3:00 p.m. on the 23rd, just as the first showing was about to end at the various theaters in Beiju, a gunshot suddenly rang out in the Suzhou Theater. In an instant, several wounded soldiers and youth army soldiers responsible for discipline clashed in the Youth Club Film Department and the Suzhou Theater. Before long, the guard team of the Guanzheng police area, after hearing the news, rushed to the scene fully armed, led by platoon leaders Zhang Zonghai and Yang Hongying, with more than a dozen troops. However, the wounded soldiers had gathered about forty or fifty people, and the situation was turbulent and could not be suppressed. At this time, the youth army soldiers Yu Gang and Huang Yuzhou, who first participated in the fight, were seriously injured and fell to the ground. Seeing this, the guard cadres were unable to restrain their anger, and the tragedy began. For a time, gunshots were continuous, pedestrians scurried to hide, and the Beiju area suddenly entered a state of war. After the local police station telegraphed the relevant parties, Battalion Commander Yao Depei of the Military Police, Chief of Staff Lei Kaixuan of the City Defense Department, and Dean Zheng Zukui of the Rear Hospital all rushed to the scene one after another.</p>
<p>Many Deaths and Injuries: At that time, the cadres of both sides were still deadlocked. The wounded soldiers believed that four of their companions had been killed, including Ku Zhiming, Luo Zhaojin, and Zhang Qinghan, and one person, Mo Youlin, was seriously injured, causing their emotions to be angered and they swore not to retreat. Battalion Commander Yao Depei took emergency measures and agreed to detain platoon leaders Zhang Zonghai and Yang Hongying to appease the crowd. At the same time, Dean Zheng Zukui also gave earnest explanations and persuaded them to return. The wounded soldiers then lined up and left the scene. Chief of Staff Lei Kaixuan, in order to prevent accidents, issued a curfew order, cutting off traffic in the Beiju area. The wounded were sent to the hospital for emergency treatment, and the Wudi Procuratorate was telegraphed to send personnel to examine the bodies. At that time, it was suddenly reported that Jiao Huanian, a messenger of the Youth Army, had encountered several wounded soldiers at Chayuan Changkou and was seriously injured, and two others were missing. Eight rifles and two Thompson guns were taken. Lei and Zheng then issued orders to their subordinates, respectively, to prohibit them from going out. At the same time, it was also found that Chen Zuer, the owner of a fruit stall in front of the Daguangming Theater, was hit in the right waist by a stray bullet, and his injuries were critical. He was also ordered to be sent to Bohong Hospital for treatment.</p>
<p>Deliberating on the Aftermath: After the various parties made proper arrangements, Battalion Commander Yao invited Lei and Chen to gather at the Beiju Military Police Team to deliberate on the aftermath. It was decided that (1) the bodies would be buried generously, and preferential treatment would be given to the Zheng family. (2) In the future, disciplinary work will be jointly maintained by the military police. (3) The issue of responsibility will be reported to the superiors and await disposition. Reporters from this newspaper separately interviewed the three gentlemen and inquired about the causes of the incident. Chief of Staff Lei Kaixuan replied: The headquarters is responsible for city defense and strictly prohibits military personnel from watching plays without tickets. The intention is to sympathize with business difficulties, which has caused a lot of resentment with the wounded soldiers for more than half a month. In addition, on the 21st, two wounded soldiers strongly demanded to watch a play without tickets. After being detained by the inspection team, the wounded soldier hospital was telegraphed to take them away for control. The fuse lies here. Before the incident, the headquarters had learned that they were planning to cause a major riot, so it had already ordered the inspection soldiers not to interfere any more in order to ease the situation. Unfortunately, the tragedy still broke out. However, according to reports from various parties, the wounded soldiers did have firearms and snatched weapons, and first shot and wounded the headquarters soldiers. Also, an hour after the incident, gunshots were also found on Pishi Street, which was definitely not done by the youth army units. Moreover, the total number of wounded soldiers in Suzhou reached more than a thousand people. Looking at today's momentum, the number of people dispatched was around two hundred. Next, Dean Zheng Zukui stated: It is extremely difficult to manage wounded soldiers, because they are loyal to the country, but their current lives are difficult, which affects their emotions and makes them irritable. The detention of the two wounded soldier leaders by the youth army the day before yesterday was the main reason for the tragedy. I had heard rumors in advance, so after 2:00 p.m. today, I went to the various theaters to observe and advised the wounded soldiers watching the play to return to the hospital. Seeing that the situation was calm, I returned first. However, I heard the police in the middle of the road and rushed to the scene. I only saw about forty or fifty wounded soldiers. They have now all returned. As for having firearms and snatching weapons, I don’t think the wounded soldiers would have done this. Battalion Commander Yao Depei stated: The tragedy happened suddenly, and the military police were unable to stop it, which is indeed regrettable. Fortunately, it has now subsided, and there is absolutely no problem in maintaining law and order. The public can rest assured. The two detained platoon leaders will be sent to the city defense department for interrogation.</p>
<p>State of Martial Law: Finally, Chief of Staff Lei stated that Zheng Chenjun, Deputy Director of the Youth Army Division, stated that he would do his best to maintain the security of Suzhou. The reporter asked when the curfew order would be lifted. He said that after the examination is completed and the bodies are encoffined, traffic will be restored. At about 10:00 p.m., the Beiju area was still under curfew. Because Commander Cao Yongxiang of the City Defense Command was away on official business, it is still difficult to determine how the aftermath will be handled.</p>
<h3>The Main Culprits in the Wanbaoshan Incident, Hao Yongde, etc., Have Been Concluded After Investigation; The Changchun District Prosecutor's Office Has Filed a Public Prosecution</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Changchun, 23rd] The main culprits in the Wanbaoshan Incident, the prelude to the "September 18th" Incident, Hao Yongde and others, were reported by the Changchun Garrison Command in June of this year and handed over to the Changchun District Prosecutor's Office. The investigation has now been completed. The defendants Hao Yongde and others have confessed to organizing the Changan Rice Company, arresting Koreans, relying on Japanese power, and oppressing landlord Sun Yongqing and other facts. The District Prosecutor's Office has filed a public prosecution with the Changchun District Court. The content of the case is that the defendant Hao Yongde bribed the deceased Changchun County Magistrate Ma Yiyuan in March of the 20th year of the Republic of China to organize the Changan Rice Company. The defendant Zeng Yanshi acted as guarantor to lease more than 500 acres of land in the Majia Shaokou area of Changchun County and sublet it to Koreans to grow rice. Because the defendants Bian Xiangren, Li Zaohe, Liu Longhua, and Lin Zhentai had led 188 Koreans to dig ditches to divert water there, it caused a dispute between the local people and the Koreans on July 1. At that time, our side, according to the Gando Convention of September 4, 1909, which "prohibited Koreans from residing and renting land," negotiated with Japan, but the Japanese side did not show the convention and sent police to protect the Koreans in digging the ditch and fired at our people. At the same time, Japan expanded its propaganda, resulting in a Chinese exclusion massacre in Korea. Later, the water diversion ditch in the area was finally dug under the protection of the Japanese police. The incident was not resolved until the "September 18th" Incident.</p>
<h3>Madame Chiang Kai-shek Donates Public Funds to Aid Xiaguan Refugees</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 23rd] Madame Chiang Kai-shek recently donated all of her allowances as a National Assembly delegate, including food and lodging expenses, totaling over one million yuan, to the refugees in Xiaguan for relief. The matter has been handled on her behalf by the General Affairs Office of the National Assembly.</p>
<h3>Traitor Luo Junqiang's Third Trial Postponed</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 23rd] The third public trial of traitor Luo Junqiang, originally scheduled for the 26th, has been postponed. It is reported that although the document from the Anhui Provincial Government concerning the investigation of Luo's crimes, as requested by the High Court, has arrived, it only states that personnel have been dispatched to the Sixth District Administrative Office in Wuhu to investigate. The public trial and commencement of arguments can only proceed after the results of the investigation arrive, thus inevitably delaying the trial.</p>
<h3>Female Traitor Ke Jinfeng Escorted from Shanghai to Hankou</h3>
<p>[Our Hankou Dispatch of the 23rd] The notorious female traitor Ke Jinfeng, also known as Tan Xiaojiao, has recently been escorted to Hankou from Shanghai. Ke is the adopted daughter of the traitor Chu Minyi. She colluded with enemy forces to kill our underground workers in Hankou.</p>
<h3>Editorial: Concerning the Situation in Vietnam</h3>
<p>We are deeply concerned about the recent developments in Vietnam. As of this writing, news from Vietnam and about the Vietnamese situation is quite confusing. All we know is that armed conflicts are taking place throughout northern Vietnam, and the bloodshed has not stopped. However, another publication reports that the French government has ordered French troops in Vietnam to surrender to the Viet Minh government to prevent a massacre of the French in Vietnam. Contrary to this news, Reuters reports that the 25th Parachute Division of the French army stationed in Tunisia has been ordered to reinforce the French defense forces in Vietnam. It is reported that the armed conflict has spread to Hanoi, Tonkin, and even throughout Cochinchina, with many casualties on both the French and Vietnamese sides. It is currently difficult to determine the true situation in Vietnam; however, according to news released by the French, the conflicts in Hanoi and Tokyo have gradually been quelled. But whether this is a true reflection of the development of the situation is difficult for us to judge at this moment.</p>
<p>At this time, three aspects of the reports are worth our attention: (1) Agence France-Presse (AFP) in Tunis reported on the 21st that the Governor of Vietnam, Vice Admiral d'Argenlieu, who was passing through on his way to Vietnam, told reporters that he was deeply sorry that the recent events in Vietnam occurred during his absence; therefore, his knowledge of the situation in Vietnam was very limited; (2) French Colonial Minister Moutet has left France for Vietnam to investigate the Franco-Vietnamese conflict and will come to Nanjing in the future "to pay a courtesy visit to Chairman Chiang and to request that China faithfully adhere to its promise to maintain neutrality in the Vietnamese conflict." (3) According to an AFP report, the leader of the Vietnamese Nationalist Party, former Foreign Minister of the Viet Minh Republic, Ge Yingtongdan, is now in Nanjing and told AFP reporters that the Vietnamese "National Front Government" has been formed and will announce the location of the new government at an appropriate time, which the AFP reporter speculates is likely to be in Nanjing. Its four major policies are: (1) The United States and China should mediate to initiate negotiations with France and ensure that any agreement reached will be immediately implemented; (2) The Viet Minh must become a truly free state within the Vietnamese Federation and the French Federation, with its territory including all three parts of Vietnam; (3) The Viet Minh must have a proportionate number of representatives in the Vietnamese Federal Council; the chairman of the council will be French, but his powers will be similar to those of a British commissioner in Australia; (4) French troops may occupy certain specific locations within the Viet Minh, but must withdraw from these locations within five years. All economic and cultural interests of the French in the Viet Minh will be faithfully guaranteed by the Viet Minh government.</p>
<p>From the above, we can see that the French governor in Vietnam knows very little about the recent turmoil in Vietnam; although this may be a formality, it is not objectionable in itself. We do not know whether AFP's report on the leader of the Vietnamese Nationalist Party has other intentions; however, we are surprised by the moderate attitude they hold in the four major policies of the so-called Vietnamese "National Front Government" it released. Today, India is demanding independence, Burma is demanding independence, and even the Dutch East Indies are demanding independence; but Vietnam can be satisfied with a position that is roughly equivalent to a "dominion" within the British Empire, that is, a so-called autonomous region, which seems quite thought-provoking. To say that the Vietnamese people have no national awakening, there are many patriots who have sacrificed themselves for their country, and many have been exiled by the French authorities in Vietnam to barren areas full of epidemics and miasma, such as Devil's Island in South America and desert islands in the Pacific, for Vietnam. They do not hesitate to endure humiliation to death for the righteousness of their motherland. If the Vietnamese nationalists are aware of the real environment of the current international political situation and therefore do not make far-reaching demands based on ideals, then we do not understand why the enlightened Fourth French Republic government does not adopt these moderate demands, but instead has to create bloody incidents.</p>
<p>However, what we cannot help but say is about the visit of the French Colonial Minister. This minister is coming to the East to investigate the Franco-Vietnamese conflict and will also come to China "to pay a courtesy visit to Chairman Chiang," and "intends to ask China to abide by its promise to remain neutral in the Vietnamese conflict." We do not want to question the truthfulness of this report; what we cannot help but state here is that regardless of the government's attitude, the Chinese people's attitude in the Vietnamese conflict is not neutral. We do not deny where our sympathy lies. Our government has the right to weigh and decide on its attitude towards the Vietnamese incident, and we do not want to say much about it here. But the Chinese people and the Vietnamese people are as close as brothers, and we are naturally very concerned about their welfare. We seem to have experienced the experiences of the Vietnamese people in the past few decades; therefore, the Chinese people understand the national aspirations of the Vietnamese people most and have great sympathy for them. Therefore, we feel regret for the French army's attempt to use force to defeat the national movement of the Vietnamese people, for the sake of France itself.</p>
<p>When the New York People's Voice Forum newspaper discussed France's policy in the Far East, it said: "The era when whites can develop the colored people of Asia is about to pass; France must know this; in terms of France, it is currently struggling hard in a very serious political difficulty, and has not yet made significant progress on the subtle issues it should resolve. France is now trying to replace the French Empire with the concept of the French Federation, but Vietnam does not want to accept this concept. Judging from British Prime Minister Attlee's announcement in the House of Commons that Burma should be granted independence, and the Dutch Parliament's approval of the plan to establish the Indonesian Federation, which still belongs to the King of the Netherlands, it can be seen that France's attitude cannot be compared with that of Britain and the Netherlands." This is indeed a fair judgment. If the Vietnam issue is not properly resolved, it will leave future troubles for peace in the Far East. Therefore, we must urge the French government to properly handle the Vietnam issue; otherwise, the Vietnamese situation is related to the international situation, and all nations that care about world peace cannot allow this situation to continue to drag on.</p>

<h3>The Old Course of the Lower Yellow River Has Not Been Dredged; The Breach at Zhongmou Must Be Quickly Blocked To Avoid Catastrophic Disasters for Dozens of Counties in Shandong Province; The Shandong Provincial United Association of Fellow Villagers in Jinan Petitions Again</h3>
<p>[Our Jinan Dispatch] Shandong Province is located in the lower reaches of the Yellow River and has long been known as a dangerous area. The northwestern counties, from Jiyang to Lijin County, where the river flows into the sea, are the tail end of the Yellow River, with many dangerous works. Since the breach at Zhongmou, the Shandong section of the Yellow River has existed in name only, and the river water is almost dried up. Since the victory, the Yellow River Conservancy Commission has been engaged in blocking the breach and restoring the dikes. However, because the section from Jiyang to the estuary is the "Liberated Area" of the Communists, the restored dike bodies are loose and thin, and the estuary has not been dredged. The Shandong Northwest Counties Fellow Villagers Association in Jinan is concerned that once the Huayuankou breach is blocked and closed, the Yellow River will return to its old course, and the main stream will flow eastward, which may lead to danger. They have petitioned the Provincial Assembly, requesting that the blocking of the Zhongmou breach be temporarily delayed until the riverbed and dikes are fully excavated and repaired and the estuary is unblocked. The Shandong Provincial United Association of Fellow Villagers in Jinan, following the demands of the people, has again telegraphed the central government, requesting consideration for the lives and property of the people in dozens of counties downstream, and that the blocking of the breach be temporarily delayed until the dike restoration project is completed and consolidated. They also plan to present a petition in person, preparing to petition all relevant parties, the Yellow River Breach Blocking and Dike Restoration Engineering Bureau, and the inspection personnel of the Yellow River Conservancy Commission when they arrive in Jinan. The petition roughly states: The old course of the Yellow River, and the dikes in the lower reaches of Shandong, have been extremely damaged during the war. The river excavation and dike repair project from Jiyang to Lijin was handled by the so-called Liberated Area's Labor Mobilization Office, and the dike bodies are extremely loose. The excavation of silted riverbeds is also very narrow, and although the two banks are vertical and the shape is beautiful, using them as the Yellow River waterway is prone to scouring and collapse. Once water is released eastward, the main stream will scour, and danger may occur soon. These hasty projects may be effective for defense works, but it is doubtful whether they can withstand the turbulent Yellow River, and there is a risk of causing danger and submerging the lives and property of millions of people in dozens of counties downstream. Furthermore, in river management, dredging the estuary is the most important. If the estuary is not clear, no matter how wide the river is, it is difficult to accommodate the Yellow River, which originates thousands of miles away. Since the Yellow River changed its course from Tie menguan into the sea in the fifth year of the Qing Xianfeng reign, the estuary has shifted more than ten times before the war, all because the iron plate sand at the mouth of the river was silted up and the water flow was not smooth. The riverbed is prone to overflowing, and there are often dangers of breaching. The estuary must naturally change its course at any time and overflow into the sea. There are no formal estuaries in the two to three hundred miles above the estuary, allowing it to overflow freely, and there are no dikes to confine the water and scour the sand. This time, the Yellow River restoration project in the so-called Liberated Area's river excavation and dike repair project is extremely hasty, and no attention has been paid to the main project of dredging the estuary. Once the Huayuankou breach is blocked and closed, not only will there be danger on both banks of the river, but the silting of the estuary will easily cause accidents in the entire river. The counties in northern and southwestern Shandong are close to the Yellow River and have a greater stake in it, facing major dangers, so they cannot remain silent. To prevent future dangers, and for the safety of the lives and property of millions of people, they jointly petition, requesting that it be forwarded to the central government to show compassion for the people of dozens of counties: (1) Temporarily delay the blocking of the Huayuankou breach. (2) Excavate and repair the riverbed dikes from Jiyang to Lijin thoroughly and carefully. (3) Build solid dikes on both sides of the estuary, extending directly to the coast, confining the water and scouring the sand, and widening the excavation of the estuary. (4) Prepare ten dredgers to be used after the water is released to continuously dredge the silted riverbed and estuary all year round, once and for all. After the above four items are completed, the Huayuankou breach will be blocked and closed, etc.</p>
<h3>Tax Collectors in the Countryside of Wuxi Engage in Embezzlement and Malpractice; Collude with Remnants of Traitors and Illegally Set Up Branch Checkpoints</h3>
<p>[Our Wuxi Dispatch] The County Tax Collection Office recently received a confidential report, learning that more than ten of its license tax collectors dispatched to Huangbudun, including Li Haoqing and Shen Qingyuan, were extorting license fees from boatmen and colluding with former inspectors from the enemy puppet period to illegally set up branch checkpoints at Huinong Bridge, Qingming Bridge, etc. In addition to collecting the prescribed fees from passing boatmen, they also overcharged fees four or five times higher than the original rate, which they pocketed privately or divided among themselves.

<h3>Elementary School Textbooks Are Being Improved</h3>
<p>Regarding Mr. Yu Jingfen's article "Elementary School Textbooks Urgently Need Improvement" published previously in this newspaper, the National Compilation and Translation Bureau has sent a letter stating: (1) Poor Paper and Blurry Printing: The Ministry of Education has stipulated paper and printing conditions for the current series of elementary school textbooks to ensure clarity and avoid damaging children's eyesight. The Shanghai United Supply Office also pays attention to this. Therefore, the names of the printing houses are listed in the lower right corner of the copyright page of each book, such as "Commercial Press," "Zhonghua," and "Zhengzhong," to facilitate identification and show responsibility. In addition to informing the seven joint supply offices to improve the cover by using thicker paper and striving for excellence, it is hoped that schools will compare the paper and printing of the books printed by various publishing houses when adopting textbooks and choose the best ones to promote competition among the publishing houses and strive for improvement. (2) Too Many Typos and Different Editions: The elementary school textbooks supplied by Shanghai in the autumn of last year and the spring of this year were the standard editions during the Anti-Japanese War. The editions supplied in the autumn of this year should be the revised standard editions after the victory. Most of the anti-Japanese war materials have been deleted and replaced with nation-building materials. Schools should pay attention to the "Revised Standard Edition" printed on the cover of the textbooks when selecting books to avoid buying old versions. The revised standard edition was rushed in Shanghai during the summer vacation. Due to time constraints, there were many typesetting errors. In addition to publishing corrections in Shen Bao, a dedicated errata sheet has been printed and submitted to provincial and municipal education bureaus for distribution to schools for correction to avoid misleading. The seven United Supply Offices have also been notified to modify the printing plates to ensure that there are no more errors in the books printed in the next edition. (3) Outdated Content: The Ministry-compiled textbooks covered the five years leading up to and during World War II, during which domestic and international situations changed significantly. Therefore, the elementary school general knowledge curriculum has been revised four times in five years, which is largely able to adapt to the times. Regular revisions and up-to-date teaching materials are one of the advantages of the Ministry-compiled textbooks. However, the situation is different for geography textbooks. Their revision must wait for definitive data before it can begin. Therefore, although the Ministry of Education has repeatedly ordered revisions, only partial corrections have been made to the original book, and it has not been submitted for typesetting and printing. For example, regarding the division of Northeast China into nine provinces mentioned by Mr. Yu, although there are names for the nine provinces to date, the provincial boundaries, area under jurisdiction, and population of the nine provinces have not been determined. (The descriptions of the division of the nine provinces in Northeast China published in various newspapers are not official announcements, and textbooks must be included after the central government publishes them.) It cannot be included. The bureau is in constant contact with the Ministry of Interior. However, as of recently (the official letter from the Ministry of Interior still states: "Regarding the provincial boundaries of the provinces in Northeast China, this Ministry has drafted a revised plan for the new province regions of Northeast China and submitted it for approval, which will be announced upon approval," etc., so the revision of this point still requires some time. In addition, the boundary lines of Outer Mongolia, the borders of European countries, and the jurisdiction of islands in Africa and the Pacific have not been determined and can only be temporarily postponed. For all these changes in current affairs, it is hoped that teachers in various schools will supplement them temporarily during teaching to make up for the lack of teaching materials. The above points are of concern to more than just Mr. Yu. Please develop them and inform the educators.</p>

<h3>Bevin Delivers Radio Address, Emphasizes Lasting World Peace</h3>
<p>Says China with its Long History will surely be unified, Britain Located between US and Soviet Union has a Positive Strength</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 22nd] British Foreign Secretary Bevin delivered a radio address tonight, strongly stating his deep conviction that China will surely be unified. With its long-standing philosophy and experience, it will undoubtedly make a significant contribution to the world's restoration. He said: "I believe we have entered the first stage of establishing coordination and harmony among the powers. What is the reason for this? First, we have reached an agreement on the first batch of peace treaties, namely the peace treaties with Italy, Romania, Hungary, Bulgaria, and Finland. Second, we are forming an organization that will enable the United Nations to follow in their mutual relations and to maintain peace. Although we have won the victory, the cost has been enormous, with heavy losses in manpower and material resources, which are difficult to estimate. However, we are now clear about the shortcomings of the old League of Nations and have organized the United Nations to take its place, which is a pleasant thing after the war. Although the United Nations organization is not yet perfect, it should be gradually improved in the future. As far as Britain itself is concerned, we have decided to base our future relations with the world on the resolutions of the United Nations. There are three main conditions for the current policy: first, to make the armaments of all countries unnecessary; second, to achieve a state of peace that allows human thought to turn to economic and cultural development; and third, to enable all countries to enjoy all the natural resources of the world."</p>
<p>Regarding the Trieste Free Territory problem, the special zone is where the Latin and Slavic peoples meet. The Five Powers have done their utmost to minimize the number of Italians under Slavic rule. Conversely, the number of Slavs under American rule has also been minimized. The establishment of an international area should create a meeting point.</p>
<p>As for the German question, we will create a situation in Germany that allows the German people to regain their original self-esteem. But the German people must know that it will take a considerable amount of time for this situation to arise. The situation in Germany has been affected by Hitler's rule. It may take decades to restore it to normal. The next meeting of the four foreign ministers has now been scheduled for March 20th in Moscow, where the future of Germany and Austria will be discussed.</p>
<p>Regarding economic systems, countries are different. For example, the United States is a country of free enterprise, while the Soviet Union has developed a different economic system. Unfortunately, it suffered terrible losses due to German aggression, which almost completely destroyed the great achievements it had made since the October Revolution. As for France, it has been invaded three times and can still demonstrate its permanent principles of freedom before the countries of the world, which is commendable.</p>
<p>As for China, it has resisted for the longest time, and even today, internal strife continues, which is regrettable. But China will surely be unified, and its long-standing philosophy and experience will undoubtedly make a significant contribution to the world's revival. There is no doubt about this. The United States and the Soviet Union have gained an advantage because of World War II. As for Britain, it is located in the middle. All these developments are sufficient to prove that the policies adopted by Britain after the end of the war have a positive force. Some aspects have criticized Britain's relationship with the United States as being too close, while its relationship with the Soviet Union is not close enough, which may lead to a third world war. You must have heard of this argument. In fact, Britain has not allowed itself to be bound by any country. Britain is sincerely willing to extend the hand of friendship and cooperation to all countries in the world. I believe that the Soviet Union fully understands that all countries in the world are prepared to cooperate with Britain and are willing to see the Soviet Union develop its system in its own way. We are not only creating peace for the people of today, but also creating peace for future generations, so we must proceed slowly and strive for perfection. I hope the people of the whole country will be patient and not impatient."</p>
<h3>Truman's Christmas Message: May the People of Our Country Continue to Work Hard and Strive to Enable the People of the World to Share Peace</h3>
<p>[United States Information Service, Washington, 22nd] President Truman issued the following Christmas message to the worldwide American armed forces: "I am very pleased to take this opportunity to congratulate you on the Christmas holiday. We are now engaged in a great struggle to create a just and lasting peace for all countries and nations in the world, today and tomorrow. To accomplish our mission, we need our armed forces, both men and women, to have the same contributions and the same lofty ideals as you have always shown. Peace-loving people all over the world prayed for victory in the war in the dark past, and now they are praying for harmony and tranquility on earth. Their prayers will surely succeed. I want to express the nation's deep gratitude for the role you have played, and I hope that our gratitude can compensate you for the regret of being away from home and spending this Christmas abroad. May you all have a Merry Christmas."</p>
<p>Aimed at Preventing War, Not Engaging in New Wars</p>
<p>At the same time, Secretary of the Army Patterson and Chief of Staff Eisenhower also sent telegrams to American troops around the world, the content of which is as follows: Patterson telegraphed: "On this Christmas holiday, I would like to express my sincere greetings and regards to all military and civilian personnel around the world, and thank you for your faithful service over the past year. This has been a difficult year, but you have gloriously completed this arduous task. You have shown the courage, wisdom, and dedication of soldiers, which has made you famous on the battlefield and has earned you praise and respect. Your work at home and abroad still upholds the best military traditions."</p>
<p>Eisenhower telegraphed: "You are all soldiers, and you are all engaged in a certain mission, engaged in establishing and maintaining a certain situation to promote the spirit of Christmas so that it can be widely spread throughout the world. No matter where you are stationed and what kind of work you are engaged in, you are all maintainers of peace. Because of your efforts, we can fully celebrate this Christmas and the Christmases in the future and be spared the horrors of war. Although past achievements show that you must be perfect in technology, discipline, and spirit, your basic goal should be to prevent war, not to engage in war. I would like to express my sincere greetings and regards to all personnel belonging to the armed forces of this country."</p>

<h3>Britain and the Soviet Union Conclude Agreement to Open Trade in Occupied Zones</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Berlin, 22nd, United Press] British authorities here announced that Britain and the Soviet Union have signed an agreement to open trade in the occupied zones of the two countries, and the American occupied zone will automatically participate. The validity of this agreement is said to be the spring of 1947. British authorities also specifically stated that although the American authorities did not participate in the signing, they assisted in the completion of this agreement and approved it. This agreement is based on the agreement that was valid for the last four months of this year, with only a few clauses stipulating barter trade, giving the Germans the first opportunity to negotiate the basis for future trade agreements in the occupied areas. According to the agreement, the British and American occupied zones will transport 130,000 tons of steel, 15,000 sets of tires, and 500 horses to the Soviet occupied zone. The Soviet Union will weave 42,000 tons of potatoes, 34,000 tons of wheat, and 9,000 tons of sugar to the British and American occupied zones.</p>
<h3>Turkey Launches Organization, Middle East Peace Group, News from London is Ambiguous, Soviet Union has Paid Close Attention</h3>
<p>[United Press, San Francisco, 22nd] Turkish people in London quietly confirmed that Turkey is exploring the possibility of Arab countries and Turkey forming a Middle East peace consultation country. Although the rumors are slow and unclear, they have been difficult to escape Moscow's attention. The Communist Party's "Pravda" immediately criticized Turkey, accusing Turkish leaders of pursuing dangerous policies, wanting to expand the scope of dangerous activities, and falling into the trap of foreign imperialist forces. The Soviet Union's rapid response is obviously a warning to Turkey to mind its own business. Whether Turkey's plan can be realized is another question, but "Pravda" believes that Turkey is trying to form a group of Arab countries, with the non-Arab Turkey as its leader.</p>

<h3>Our Country's Female Scientist Discovers New Fission of Uranium</h3>
<p>Results of Hard Work by Qian Sanqiang and his Wife</p>
<p>[British Information Service, London, 23rd] The science editor of News Chronicle wrote: "A Chinese female scientist, working at the Curie Laboratory of the French University of Paris one night, discovered a new fission of uranium, which has attracted the close attention of atomic physicists. She discovered a new atomic phenomenon under a microscope, that is, the uranium atom splits into four parts instead of the original split into two parts. So far, it has been generally recognized in the research of atomic bombs that there are two-part splits. The significance of this new discovery is still in progress, but it has opened up a new way for scientists engaged in research. This discovery was made by Dr. Powell at the University of Bristol, who made a photographic plate to reveal the shape of atomic molecules. He Cifeng's husband, Dr. Qian Sanqiang (son of Qian Xuantong), spent a month in Bristol studying the technology for the discovery of "four-part split." After Dr. Qian returned to Paris, he used a specially made photographic plate rich in silver. He coated the photographic plate with uranium salt and caused it to explode with neutral electrons of atomic molecules. Under a high-power microscope, he found traces in the fragments split by neutral electrons on the left side of the photographic plate. Dr. Qian said: "On the evening of November 22, my wife discovered that a photographic plate was quite different. When placed under a microscope, it was found that there were four black lines from one point. Two of the lines were longer and two were shorter. The next day, the equal black lines were confirmed. After careful study, the equal poles were satisfied, because the performance of the four molecules was actually equal to 100 million watts."</p>

<h3>Second Christmas Message After the War: May Peace Reign Throughout the World</h3>
<p>According to United Press reports, at least ten countries are still bleeding in a war-torn world...</p>
<p>[United Press, London, 22nd] The second Christmas of Jesus after World War II in the 20th century, peace on earth is still an unrealized ideal. Even though the United Nations organization is striving for lasting peace, according to a report from United Press, at least ten countries are still bleeding. The war between the Iranian government forces and the autonomous forces of the Azerbaijan province supported by the Soviet Union has not been stopped for long. The following is the latest situation in various countries in Europe and the Near East:</p>
<p>Greece In fact, the civil war is still going on in northern Greece. Guerrillas, who the government side refers to as communists, attack in groups, each group ranging from one hundred to one thousand people. Their weapons include mortars, heavy machine guns, and automatic rifles. They attack mountain police teams and sentinel posts and villages, and government forces also retaliate against them. Communist newspapers call this movement "resistance to monarch fascism," which is completely out of the spontaneity of the people and has nothing to do with foreign countries. The Greek government, which has the closest relationship with Britain, said that these bandits are receiving supplies and instructions from Bulgaria, Yugoslavia, and Albania, but Bulgaria, Yugoslavia, and Albania categorically deny it.</p>
<p>Poland The Polish interim government, which leans towards the Soviet Union, still has an underground army trying to overthrow it, and the domestic war is intermittent. In addition, Ukrainian nationalists occasionally attack at night, and the government side deals with it. The two largest anti-government underground organizations in Poland, one is the "National Armed Forces" and the other is the "Freedom and Independence Army," have a strength of about 15,000 to 100,000 people. They have announced that their purpose is to use sabotage, looting, armed attacks on government agencies, assassination of government officials, and Soviet soldiers to overthrow the current government. According to an official announcement from Poland, more than 8,000 officials have been killed in a year. Since liberation, the number of casualties among the Polish government forces has been nearly 4,000. The number of casualties on the underground organization side is much higher. The underground troops mostly use forests as their haunts. As for the Ukrainians, they saw that Poland had signed an agreement with the Soviet Union last year, stipulating that 434,000 Ukrainians in Poland would be moved to the Soviet Union, and the vacated land would be inhabited by Poles, which aroused the opposition of the Ukrainians. At that time, about 2,000 Ukrainians rode on horses and motor vehicles and broke into Poland at night, burning, killing, and looting, causing 141,000 Poles in the San River area to become homeless.</p>
<p>Palestine The British garrison's conflict with Jews and Arabs has made Palestine a troubled area. More than 350,000 people have been killed this year, and property losses are estimated at more than 10 million US dollars. The Jews mostly want to establish a Jewish homeland. The Arabs mostly want to establish an independent country and enjoy the rights of the majority. Britain also wants to maintain peace and maintain the military stronghold in the Eastern Mediterranean. The Jews ignore immigration restrictions and try to enter Palestine, causing conflicts with the army. The Jewish secret terrorist group buried landmines on the highway, attacked cars, and blew up public buildings, trapping the British army.</p>
<p>Egypt Nationalist demonstrations oppose the continued stationing of British troops in Egypt. Students and other demonstrators have sporadic clashes with the military police. This spring's demonstrations caused clashes with British troops and overthrew a government. At the same time, grenades were thrown at police stations and British troops' taverns and restaurants. The number of Egyptian troops is estimated to be between 60,000 and 80,000. The British troops stationed in Egypt are much larger than this number. British troops have agreed to withdraw from the Suez Canal area before March 1947. According to the 1936 Anglo-Egyptian Treaty of Alliance, Britain may station a limited military force in Egypt until 1956, but according to the pending new proposal, British troops should withdraw from Egypt completely before September 1, 1949.</p>
<h3>Nehru Plans to Organize Asian National League</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 22nd] According to the Sunday Observer, Nehru, the vice-chairman of the Indian interim government, is considering a plan to organize an Asian National League. He also represents the Indian interim government and invites 12 independent Asian countries and 18 governments and representative countries of other entrusted rule areas and territories to participate in the conference. These countries include China, Korea, Malaya, the government of Vietnam, the government of the Republic of Indonesia, and Arab and Jewish representatives from Palestine.</p>
<h3>Double Happiness Arrives</h3>
<p>New Bride Arrives from England, Gives Birth to One Girl and Three Boys</p>
<p>[United Press International, Baltimore, Maryland, 22nd] Mrs. Hai'an gave birth to quadruplets today, three boys and one girl. Doctors say the quadruplets are perfectly healthy. Their weight ranges from six and a half pounds to seven and a quarter pounds. Mrs. Hai is a war bride from England. Her husband is a 28-year-old stapler. The couple had one son before.</p>
<h3>Expanding Radar Applications, Soviet Union's New Fishing Method</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Moscow, 22nd] The Soviet Union is currently taking steps to improve fishing methods. Soviet fishing fleets will be equipped with extremely strong sound equipment to detect fish schools. This equipment includes radar waves. The application of radar is being expanded because Soviet fishing boats have used radar to discover large schools of herring.</p>

<h3>Encroaching Upon Enemy Property: One of the Major Cases Transferred by the Investigation Team, Wang Zhuchen Initially Interrogated, Testimony Inconsistent with Letter from Chief of Staff of the Garrison Command, Judge Lian to Personally Investigate and Collect Evidence</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] The case of Wang Zhuchen's suspected encroachment upon automotive materials from the enemy Changdao Foreign Firm, after being transferred by the investigation team to the District Procuratorate for investigation, was prosecuted on the 21st of last month on charges of encroachment. Yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM, Judge Lian Zhenbang of the District Court conducted the initial hearing, first summoning the defendant Wang Zhuchen. Wang was wearing a black overcoat and a dark grey western suit. He was burly and composed. Judge Lian only inquired about his age and native place before adjourning the hearing. Then the informants Wu Tianxiang and Du Donglin were summoned. Wu stated that before the war, he opened the Sino-American Xiangji Automobile Company at 2 Beihaining Road. He moved his entire family to safety when the Anti-Japanese War broke out. 2 Beihaining Road was subsequently occupied by the enemy Changdao Foreign Firm, which continued to operate an automobile factory there. After the victory, the premises were received by Wang Zhuchen. After Wu negotiated with the Enemy and Puppet Property Handling Bureau, the Police Bureau, etc., he was granted permission to recover the property, but Wang consistently refused to return it. Wu learned that he was actively smuggling automotive parts left behind by Changdao Foreign Firm, so he informed the investigation team and requested the return of the property. After Wu finished his statement, Fan Rongchun of the Central Machinery Factory was summoned as a witness, as the Central Machinery Factory was suspected of receiving automotive materials stolen by Wang. Fan stated that he did not know Wang. The batch of automotive parts deposited was temporarily deposited upon the instruction of Deputy Chief of the Police Sub-bureau of Zhedao Road, Gao Yongxi. At that time, he did not know their origin. Later, an employee, Yuan Dingyi, saw a report on August 13th and learned that the case of Wang Zhuchen's encroachment had been discovered. He then knew that the batch of goods was related to Wang's case. Fearing implication, he immediately reported to the military police for inventory and sealing. They remain in the original place and are guarded. He knew nothing else. Zhang Peichun was then summoned as a witness. Zhang stated that he was originally an employee of Wang, but had resigned in early July and established the ZhongSheng Repair Shop on Chuan Gong Road. The shop premises were also owned by Wang. On July 15th, he signed a lease with Wang, paying a deposit of 2 million yuan, with a monthly rent of 1 million yuan. Therefore, he had no relationship with Wang. Subsequently, Luo Boren, a Russian from the Aoduo Automobile Company, and Haishen Baoxi, a German, were summoned as witnesses. Both Luo and Ha were close friends of Wang Zhuchen. Luo had accepted automotive parts deposited by Wang Zhuchen, and Ha had served as a technical advisor at Wang's newly established XinYou Company. Their testimonies were very ambiguous. After all the witnesses were examined, Wang Zhuchen was summoned again. Wang stated that he was a graduate of Tongji University, had studied in Germany, and after returning to China, served as a mechanical engineer and a colonel-level factory director in the Air Force. In the winter of 1943, he returned to Shanghai to mourn his father's death. Afterwards, he partnered to establish the FuZhong Company on Chuan Gong Road in the city, engaging in the automotive materials business. After the victory, FuZhong was dissolved, and he established the XinYou Company with his own funds. Through his brother-in-law Yu Wei, he met Li Ji and Lan of the Garrison Command to negotiate a special contract for automobile repair, with a total capital of 20 million yuan. Initially, he planned to manufacture automobiles, but this did not materialize. In April, he moved to 2 Beihaining Road. Although the Changdao Foreign Firm had left behind automotive parts piled up in two rooms, they were all broken and unusable. Moreover, automotive materials have different ages and styles, and many Japanese relics were not applicable. The court questioned him about the parts that informant Wu Tianxiang reported he had transported away. He replied that they were transported by the Garrison Command on May 15th, a total of five trucks. At that time, when he negotiated with Chief Li of the Garrison Command, he considered using old cars to offset repair costs. However, fearing that their origin was unclear, he refused. Afterwards, the Garrison Command transported parts to offset the repair costs. He repaired a total of five vehicles, including one three-wheeled truck, and continued to repair more than twenty smaller vehicles. He also repaired a Japanese fishing boat docked in front of the Russian Consulate, but because it required more than 4 million yuan in wood, it was not completed and remains docked in the original place. The court further asked why the transportation of goods was done at night. Wang replied that they were transported day and night, not intentionally at night. The transported parts were deposited in three places: (1) the factory on Chuan Gong Road, (2) the Central Machinery Factory, and (3) the Aoduo Automobile Company. The court further asked about the letter of proof from Chief Li of the Garrison Command, stating that only two cars were repaired. Wang replied that he did not know what Chief Li meant. He actually repaired more than two vehicles. Finally, the court ordered that the case still needed to collect materials and adjourned the hearing to another date. It also stated that the court would personally conduct an inspection.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Postal Administration announced that, starting today, the office hours for all its branches on ordinary days will be changed to 7:00 AM to 7:00 PM (the office hours for the Dongchang Road branch will be changed to 7:00 AM to 6:00 PM).</p>
<h3>Deferred Conscription, Ministry of National Defense Explains Meaning</h3>
<p>Regarding the meaning of deferment of conscription and whether police should be conscripted, the Municipal Government yesterday approved a public letter from the Ministry of National Defense replying: Active-duty aged (reaching the age of 20) men who, during active-duty conscription, should not be conscripted due to public travel abroad, uncompleted studies, criminal offences, etc., may be granted postponement of conscription in accordance with the provisions of Article 24 of the current Conscription Law, referred to as deferment of conscription. However, they will still be subject to conscription when the reasons for public travel abroad and criminal offences cease to exist. Students from high schools and above who have graduated should also be conscripted into the military to complete reserve officer education. During wartime mobilization, reserve and national soldiers who are irreplaceable employees (specialized technical employees) serving in national defense industries, school teachers, those suffering from illnesses that render them unfit for combat missions, those facing livelihood difficulties, and those who should not be conscripted due to criminal offences may be granted deferment of mobilization conscription in accordance with the provisions of Article 26 of the Conscription Law, referred to as deferment of mobilization conscription. However, they will still be subject to mobilization when the above reasons cease to exist. Police only bear the responsibility of maintaining local order, do not have the status of active-duty soldiers, and are not eligible for deferment of conscription or deferment of mobilization conscription according to law. However, graduates of central police academies at all levels who are registered with the Central Military Schools Graduates Investigation Office, and those who have graduated from high schools and above and obtained military training certificates may be regarded as reserve officers and will no longer be conscripted. Approved letter forwarded, in addition to this Ministry jointly notifying the Ministry of the Interior to be informed and followed, please note for future reference.</p>
<h3>Prefabricated Steel Houses, Whether They Can Be Imported, Still Under Negotiation</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] The Mobile Golden House Investment Company shipped 25 prefabricated steel houses from the United States two weeks ago. Some of these steel houses were purchased by the company itself, and some were ordered by private individuals. The projected price is US$2,900, including customs duties and freight. The current market price for steel houses is US$5,000. Calculated at the official exchange rate, it is approximately 17 million yuan. It is understood that when these steel houses were imported, customs duties were levied at 20% according to the regulations for unnamed metal goods. The company believes that these goods should be taxed at 15% according to the regulations for building materials. However, the "Import Provisional Management Committee" believes that these steel houses should be included in the list of prohibited imports. Therefore, the company's second batch of orders has not yet proceeded. However, recently, the Municipal Government and the Social Affairs Bureau, in order to alleviate the housing shortage, contacted the company to order steel houses. Whether the steel houses can be imported will depend on further negotiations between the Customs, the "Import Management Committee," and the company.</p>
<h3>American Ships Arrive in Succession, Large Batch of Goods Loaded</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] The American ship "President Monroe" arrived at 12:45 PM yesterday and docked at the Dalae Wharf. The "General Gordon" was also scheduled to arrive in Shanghai yesterday, but had not been seen by the evening. According to the company, it is scheduled to arrive at port at 1:00 PM today. In addition, the "President Madison" is also scheduled to arrive in Shanghai today, carrying a large batch of goods, approximately 5,000 tons, to be unloaded at the Dalae Wharf.</p>
<h3>China National Aviation Corporation, Develops Northwest Air Transport, International Routes Under Preparation</h3>
<p>In order to develop air transport in the Northwest, the China National Aviation Corporation has changed its original route from Shanghai to Beijing and Hankou to fly from Shanghai to Nanjing, Zhengzhou, and then to Xi'an. It will be implemented as soon as radio and other equipment are ready.</p>
<p>According to the person in charge of the company, the China National Aviation Corporation has already signed air agreements with Britain and other countries, and there is news that air agreements with France and other countries are also about to be signed. Therefore, it is actively preparing for future international routes. It plans to establish two air routes: one from Shanghai to San Francisco, via Taiwan, Midway Island, and Guam. The other from Shanghai to Hong Kong and then to Haiphong. However, the giant six aircraft ordered by the China National Aviation Corporation from the United States have not yet arrived in Shanghai, so the opening of international routes will be difficult to achieve in the short term.</p>
<h3>Huang Jiade Safe and Sound, Death Report Was a Misunderstanding</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] It was mistakenly reported in a certain newspaper a few days ago that Huang Jiade, Associate Dean of St. John's University and editor of the Western Wind Monthly, died in a China National Aviation Corporation plane crash. Huang has already published a notice in this newspaper denying this. The reason is that two weeks ago, Huang met with dentist Dai Shugu, who unfortunately died in the crash. The two exchanged business cards, and Dai happened to have Huang's business card in his pocket when he boarded the plane, leading to the misunderstanding. Huang Jiade is actually safe and sound.</p>
<h3>Southern Hunan and Northern Guangdong, People Without Smiles, Liu Hongsheng Returns from Inspection, Talks About the Heavy Disaster Situation in the Two Provinces</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] Liu Hongsheng, Executive Director of the 행정원救濟總署 (Relief Administration), has returned to Shanghai last Saturday after visiting Suzhou, Anhui, Jiangxi, Hubei, Hunan, and Guangdong to inspect post-war relief work and the internal affairs of the branch offices. Liu reported on the trip to reporters at the Relief Administration at 3 PM yesterday, and his impressions were as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Regarding the internal work of the branch offices, Liu stated that his colleagues were very hardworking, but there was one shortcoming: the branch office colleagues did not understand the Relief Administration's entire plan and its difficulties. The branch offices all believed that the Relief Administration's materials and financial resources were extremely abundant, enough to cover regular expenses, so they spared no expense and also adopted work-relief methods, unaware that although the Relief Administration had a lot of materials, the amount was very limited after distribution. Therefore, it was necessary to select the essentials and implement them urgently. (2) The Yuehan Railway was allocated 18 locomotive heads, 1,200 boxcars, 70 kilometers of railway tracks, and 250,000 railway ties by the Relief Administration. Based on the above materials, the railway construction work should have been quite successful, but after inspection, it was greatly disappointing. However, Liu stated that the Relief Administration must assist in completing the Yuehan Railway because it was the most convenient route for transporting materials to Hunan, Hubei, Henan, and other places. If the transportation was rotated through rivers, it would be time-consuming and costly. (3) When Liu inspected Hunan and Guangdong, from Changsha to Qujiang, there were refugees everywhere without clothing or food, "even infants in arms had no smiles on their faces." The houses in Hengyang streets were almost completely destroyed. Along the way, only thatched sheds like matchboxes were seen. Seeing this situation, Liu strongly advocated that although post-war work was important, relief work should not be stopped and should be extended for three months. (4) The reason for the fire in the Kowloon Relief Administration Highway Transportation Team was said to be electrical. However, the details are still under investigation. Finally, Liu also advocated that the expenses of each office should be used more for transporting materials and less for personnel.</p>
<h3>If Commodity Prices Fluctuate Excessively, the Social Affairs Bureau Will Implement Full Control, Director Wu Kaixian Answers Reporter's Questions</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] Director Wu Kaixian of the Social Affairs Bureau met with a reporter from this newspaper yesterday and provided the following answers to inquiries:</p>
<p>Q: The end of the year is approaching, and commodity prices are fluctuating quite a bit. Will the Social Affairs Bureau take effective measures?</p>
<p>A: The current stimulus for rising commodity prices is secondly due to the seasonal increase in demand. In addition to hoping that the Central Bank can suppress gold prices, the Social Affairs Bureau will strictly control various daily necessities. For example, in the case of briquettes, I have discussed with the person in charge of the Fuel Management Committee to supervise the manufacturing of briquettes in coal yards. Only in this way can we effectively stabilize coal prices.</p>
<p>Q: If commodity prices in general fluctuate, will you implement full control?</p>
<p>A: If commodity prices fluctuate across the board, the Social Affairs Bureau will also take full control. Items that occupy a position in the cost of living index will be considered first. The principle of control will still be price negotiation by various industries, approved and implemented by the Social Affairs Bureau.</p>
<p>Q: Has the year-end bonus issue been completely resolved?</p>
<p>A: The year-end bonus issue has been largely resolved. In this event, both labor and management were able to be open and honest, which helped to resolve the issue.</p>
<p>Q: There have been many factory closures in the past week. What is the director's view on this?</p>
<p>A: This situation is truly regrettable. I believe that large-scale industrial and commercial enterprises must be maintained. The Production Loan Committee has now been formally established, and the amount of loans is very large, which will be a great help. At the same time, I sincerely hope that the labor side can understand that the biggest beneficiaries of the loan are the workers, followed by the factories. Do not think that factories and businesses can demand bonuses. The government has a responsibility to maintain industrial and commercial enterprises, and the labor side also has a responsibility. If the management makes good use of the loans and the labor side works hard to produce, then the difficult end-of-year period can be safely overcome.</p>
<p>Q: Does the director have any comments on the dispute at the Sino-American Hospital?</p>
<p>A: This matter has not been submitted to the Social Affairs Bureau for handling. The staff of the Sino-American Hospital are public servants in nature and it is a charitable cause, so it is regrettable that such an event has occurred.</p>
<h3>All 27 Defendants in the Ohrdruf Case Must Be Sent Back to Their Countries from Shanghai, US Military Court Prosecutor Firmly States</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] The list of the second batch of German expatriates to be sent back to their countries in February of next spring was announced by the authorities some time ago, and six of them were soon removed. Among these six, Stoll and Heisig are defendants in the Ohrdruf case, a spy case being tried by the US military court. Although Stoll has been acquitted, he is still detained by the US military. Heisig has not yet been sentenced. The US military authorities previously stated that all defendants in the Ohrdruf case, whether guilty or not, must be returned to their home countries for execution. Now that Stoll and Heisig have been removed from the deportation list, does this indicate that the method of dealing with the defendants in the case has changed? The reporter specifically inquired about this to Major O'Connor, the chief prosecutor of the US military court, yesterday. According to him, he was unaware of the Chinese government's removal of Stoll and Heisig from the list of German expatriates to be deported. The US military's position remains to insist that all 27 defendants in the Ohrdruf case must be sent back to their countries. The reporter further asked whether there would be negotiations with our government. O'Connor, in addition to reiterating in a firm tone that all 17 people must return to their countries, did not make any definite statement.</p>
<h3>Chenjiabang Off-Site Vegetable Vendors Petition to Continue Operating</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] The authorities originally intended to ban tens of thousands of off-site vegetable vendors in the city, but out of consideration for their livelihoods, they were allowed to continue operating in designated areas. On the 17th of this month, more than a thousand off-site vegetable vendors in the Chenjiabang area on ShanhaiGuan Road and Chengdu Road were suddenly expelled by the New City Police Sub-bureau. However, they argued that they had set up stalls in designated areas by the authorities and had not violated any regulations. They had been living in peace with the on-site vegetable vendors for more than ten years and had not hindered their business. Therefore, they separately submitted petitions to the Municipal Government, the Municipal Council, the Police Bureau, the New City Sub-bureau, and other relevant agencies, appealing to be allowed to continue operating in order to maintain their livelihoods. It is heard that Mayor Wu has expressed that they can continue to set up stalls as long as they do not obstruct traffic.</p>
<h3>Munitions Depot Explosion Case, Interrogation Work Comes to an End, Formal Public Trial Today</h3>
<p>The interrogation of personnel related to the explosion case at the first sub-depot of the Jiangwan Second Munitions Depot continued all day yesterday. In the morning, transportation soldier Lao Youjian and others were still summoned at the Shanghai East Inspection Office. In the afternoon, Chief Military Judge Bao summoned Yan Pu, the squad leader of the transportation team, at the Yuyuan Road reception center. According to Bao's statement to reporters yesterday afternoon, the interrogation work in this case has come to an end. He has reported the interrogation situation to Vice Minister Qin and plans to formally try the personnel related to the case by the military court at 2:00 PM tomorrow, which has been reported to Vice Minister Qin for a final decision. Therefore, the formal public trial of the case should be this afternoon.</p>
<h3>Flooding in the 13-Story Building Area Expected to Be Reduced</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] The ChangLe Road and MaDang Road area of this city, also known as the 13-Story Building area of the former French Concession, is flooded with tides every time there is a high tide. Designed by the Public Works Bureau, tide gates will be installed in the ditches and pipes adjacent to Nanshi, and a dam and pumping station will be built at the Zhaojiabang Rihui Port in West Shanghai to control the tide. In addition to the dam, which was completed on October 3rd, the pump station has also been completed and will be concreted as soon as the weather improves. The three large pumps used in the pumping station, each capable of pumping 60,000 gallons of water per minute, have been contracted by the New Tong Trading Company and will be installed as soon as the factory building is completed. Currently, the tide at Rihui Port is being controlled by the dam and pumping station and can no longer backflow. Therefore, there has been no flooding in the 13-Story Building area in recent months. After the pumping station is completed, the pumps can be activated and the water can be pumped outside the dam in the event of heavy rain and flooding, and the flooding can be gradually reduced.</p>
<h3>At the Municipal Government Memorial Week, Qian Jianfu Reports on Income and Expenditure</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] Qian Jianfu, Chief Secretary of the Finance Bureau, gave a comprehensive report on the city's financial income and expenditure and the improvement of the accumulation levy system at the Municipal Government Memorial Week this morning, stating that the tax revenue for this year has been increasing month by month, and so has the expenditure. The average rate of tax revenue in the first half of the year is approximately 36%, and the rate of increase in expenditure is approximately 21%, so the difference is extremely small. In the second half of the year, up to November, the rate of increase in revenue was 20%, and the rate of increase in expenditure was 24%, and the average rate of profit and loss difference between the two reached 55%, and the difference also increased. The biggest key lies in the adjustment of treatment in June and August, and the fact that the central government's subsidies have been stopped, and the newly allocated land business tax cannot be levied immediately.</p>
<h3>Ding Guitang Case, Summon Informant</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] In the case of Ding Guitang, Deputy Commissioner of Customs and Director of the Shanghai Customs Bureau, who was accused by Shen Bokang, a former customs employee, of ten major crimes including collusion with the enemy, engaging in private gain, oppressing the innocent, and shielding personnel, the High Procuratorate summoned the informant to court yesterday for detailed questioning and ordered a change of date for further questioning. Investigation will continue within days.</p>
<p>According to informant Shen Bokang's statement to reporters, Ding's ten major crimes are: (1) After the victory, Ding falsely accused him of being a traitor, resulting in his imprisonment for three months. Ultimately, he was not prosecuted due to insufficient evidence. However, Ding himself had also held a puppet position, which clearly constituted a crime of oppressing the innocent and falsely accusing him with malice. (2) When Ding was the secretary of Customs Commissioner Melolo of the Jianghai Customs in 1928, customs employees had requested higher treatment and preparations for the recovery of customs rights, but Ding sabotaged this due to his flattery of foreigners. (3) In 1942, when the Japanese enemies hijacked the Shanghai Customs, the Chinese Department was expanded into the Chinese Affairs Office, with Ding as the director. At that time, all instructions that betrayed the central government, excluded the British and Americans, and enslaved the Chinese people came from his hand. (4) Regardless of legal principles, he appointed Lu Shouwen, the deputy commissioner of the puppet customs, as the deputy commissioner of the Tianjin Customs. (5) He retained Yuan Jin, the deputy director of the Jianghai Customs Port Affairs Department of the puppet regime, as the tax collector of the Jianghai Customs. (6) He appointed Ye Yuanzhang, the director of the statistics office of the puppet customs, to an important position to receive enemy and puppet materials. (7) After the takeover, he secretly instructed Chen Qiongpei (who was appointed by Ding as the tax collector of Hankou after the victory, the protagonist of the major fraud case recently discovered by the Control Yuan) to exchange 100 million yuan of the puppet reserve coupons inventoried after the takeover at a market price without any standards, profiting from it. (8) (9) (10) He mixed the declaration of patriotic donation money and monopolized wharf transportation, with crimes of abuse of power, engaging in private gain, and dereliction of duty.</p>
<h3>Fuxing Island Gold Hiding Case, The Secret Figure Behind the Scenes May Be Discovered Soon</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] In the suspected gold hiding case on Fuxing Island, the District Procuratorate summoned Shen Xizhi, an employee of the Relief Administration, again yesterday. Because everyone summoned previously stated that Shen was the informant "Yang Yaxin", after the prosecutor Gu examined his handwriting and repeatedly questioned him, Shen did not seem to be the informant. The focus of this case is currently on finding the informant, from which clues may be obtained about the case. Prosecutor Gu is making the greatest efforts in this regard and has already made progress. This mysterious figure behind the scenes is likely to be discovered in the near future. In addition, Ohara Tetsuo, the acting chairman of the Three People's Principles Research Association established by Japanese people in Shanghai, requested the release of Japanese people Hirai Hideki and Otagako on bail. The District Procuratorate is considering whether to approve his request.</p>
<h3>Mayor Wu's Speech at Great China University: Reasons for the Economic Crisis; After the Implementation of Industrial Loans and Foreign Exchange Controls, the End of the Year May Be Passed Safely</h3>
<p>[Our Own Correspondent] Mayor Wu Guozhen, at the invitation of Great China University in Fanhuangdu yesterday morning at 10:00 AM, gave a speech during the university's weekly memorial service on the causes of the economic crisis in the city. The gist of his speech is recorded below:</p>
<p>When I took office in May of this year, I immediately convened the heads of various industries to exchange views on economic issues. At that time, most people believed that the wage problem was the most pressing, but I believed that the unemployment problem was even more serious.</p>
<p>There are four factors that have caused the economic crisis in this city:</p>
<p>(1) High-interest loans: For example, the New Asia Pharmaceutical Factory recently borrowed 2.1 billion yuan, with an interest rate of 15% per month, which means it has to pay 300 million yuan per month, making it difficult to sustain.</p>
<p>(2) High wages: In the old days of imperialism, workers were indeed exploited by capitalists, but after the war, wages have generally increased. For example, the wages of workers in the textile industry have exceeded four times the pre-war level. If workers make further excessive demands, the unemployed will still be workers after the factories close down. Therefore, I hope that the workers themselves can understand this, and I also hope that people from all walks of life will sympathize with the government. If China wants to achieve rejuvenation and national construction, the first thing to do is to compete for the market. The Nanyang market is what we should strive for, but now Japanese yarn sells for only 80 yuan per piece in Nanyang. This shows that Japan has seen our weaknesses and is using low-wage yarn to sell well in Nanyang to compete for the market.</p>
<p>(3) Dumping of foreign goods: We welcome imported goods that we need, and we can reject those that we don't. Cotton is a necessity for yarn manufacturing, and we rely on the United States for it, with a considerable amount, totaling 200 million US dollars per year. China is an agricultural country, so why can't we produce it ourselves? We must work hard.</p>
<p>(4) Inconvenient transportation. I am a member of the Kuomintang, but you should know that I am a liberal, and now I have become a reactionary. When Mr. Luce, the publisher of the American "Life" and "Time" magazines, came to China, I told him this. I have been in Shanghai for six months, and I deeply feel that the freezing of the economic situation lies in the inconvenience of transportation. The reason for the inconvenience of transportation is the sabotage of the Communist Party. If the civil war is prolonged, transportation will not be able to recover, and the economy will not be able to improve. People attack the government because of unstable living conditions. I am determined to make Shanghai better, but I encounter obstacles everywhere. Take the price of meat as an example. I have been to many meat stalls to ask about the reason for the soaring meat prices, and their answer to me is: "Mayor, this is something you cannot control. The source of meat is Northern Jiangsu, and transportation is difficult, coupled with the heavy taxes and levies along the way, so we have to sell it at this price." In short, the prerequisite for suppressing prices and stabilizing living conditions is peace. If the civil war continues, the people will no longer be able to live.</p>
<p>Everyone is worried about the upcoming end of the year, thinking that the two ends of the lunar and solar years are the most difficult times for us, but I believe that after the implementation of industrial loans and foreign exchange controls, we may be able to get through it safely.</p>
<p>You are all young people, and young people are pure, but in the current complicated political situation, while taking action may not be necessary, studying politics is necessary. You must understand the root of the economic crisis, and I hope you will never forget the pure thoughts of your youth.</p>

More than 20 committee members attended, chaired by Director Wei Shutong. The meeting adjourned around 3:00 PM. It is reported that at yesterday's meeting, a batch of loan applications was reviewed.

<h3>No All-Night Dancing Allowed on Christmas Eve; Petition Rejected Again</h3>
<p>[Our Own Correspondent] According to the latest news from the Police Bureau: All entertainment venues in the city are strictly prohibited from operating all night on Christmas Eve today. Representatives of the Dance Hall Industry Association went to the Police Bureau yesterday to petition, requesting that dance halls be allowed to extend their closing time to 2:00 AM at the latest. However, the Police Bureau resolutely rejected the request due to the importance of winter defense. It also issued a notice to all its branches to step up patrols of entertainment venues after 12:00 AM tonight. If any venues are found to be continuing to operate after hours, they will be ordered to stop immediately and will be subject to appropriate punishment.</p>
<p>American Warship to Host Refugee Children Tomorrow Afternoon</p>
<p>[Our Own Correspondent] The American naval vessel USS Boston, which is docked in the Huangpu River, will hold a grand Christmas party in the ship's main dining room tomorrow, Christmas Day, and has invited 100 underprivileged children from the Caoh Jing Refugee Children's Shelter, which is sponsored by the Social Affairs Bureau, to participate in the festivities.

It is reported that the homeless children in the refugee shelter have been rehearsing programs under the leadership of Director Zhou Zuwang, preparing to spend the holiday with the American military.</p>
<h3>A Sad Sight, Unbearable to Recall: A Wild Christmas Eve Can Only Be Found in Dreams</h3>
<p>[Our Own Correspondent's Special Feature] This year's Christmas feels a little indescribably bleak and shabby. Walking on the street and looking at the Christmas trees in the windows, it just doesn't feel right: they just hastily stick on a small piece of cotton, and that's supposed to be decorating for Christmas. You don't know how many streets you have to walk to see a single Santa Claus. Shanghai has simply become a ruined household.</p>
<p>But if you want to buy some gifts for people, you have to be a tycoon yourself. A pair of woolen socks that are pleasing to the eye is priced at 45,000 yuan. A pipe costs 50,000 yuan. A toy jeep that looks like a matchbox costs 15,000 legal tender!</p>
<p>Talking about having fun. The revelry of Christmas Eve can only be sought in memories. The world is difficult, and even having a good time is no longer possible. Dance halls must close at 12:00 AM. The police bureau is uncompromising. If you still want to join in the fun, you have to calculate your wallet first. Without 300,000 to 500,000 yuan, be careful of blushing when you stare at the bill.</p>
<p>Just spend Christmas Eve at home, buying a turkey costs 110,000 to 120,000 yuan, and brandy costs 60,000 yuan a bottle, not to mention anything else. In these years, a happy Christmas (a materially happy Christmas) is originally expensive!</p>
<p>There are nearly a hundred large and small Christian churches in this city, each with its own celebration program, but no matter what, it will not be as lively as the expanded Christmas concert at the Grand Stage last year. There are not many Allied personnel in Shanghai, and they did not distribute a hundred and one brilliantly decorated Christmas trees to various units as they did last year. Only the Eight Immortals Bridge YMCA has scheduled celebration programs from the 15th to the 28th. Today (the 24th) is a gathering for the youth group. In addition to the usual programs such as worship, dinner, games, music, and exchanging gifts, a special dance is added, which is not available on other days. The YMCA has also hung up New Year's lanterns these days, which are decorated brilliantly and dazzlingly, making you want to visit even if you are not a Christian.</p>
<h3>The Enemy Property Disposal Bureau Concludes Its Work; The Most Difficult Issue Is Staff Reduction; The German Property Clearance Office Denies That It Will Close at the End of the Year</h3>
<p>[Our Own Correspondent] According to Mr. Shen Guanya, chief secretary of the Enemy and Puppet Industry Disposal Bureau of the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui Regions, the most difficult issue in completing the bureau's work is the staff reduction problem. The Disposal Bureau has already reduced staff several times. The current number of staff is only 800. Now it has been decided to cut three-quarters of them, leaving only 200 people. After the Disposal Bureau reduces its staff and shrinks its size, it will be merged into the Central Trust Bureau in the next year, and an "Enemy and Puppet Industry Clearance Office" will be established within the bureau to take over the unfinished matters of the Disposal Bureau.</p>
<p>It is reported that the German Overseas Property Clearance Office will also be merged into the Trust Bureau. However, Mr. Chen Guanqiu, deputy director of the office, denied the news that the office would close at the end of the year. The current German property held by the office is worth approximately 20 billion yuan, most of which are dyes.</p>
<h3>Exhibition of Anti-Japanese War Documents; Many People Have Responded to the Call for Submissions</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Anti-Japanese War Document Exhibition, hosted by the Shanghai Municipal Museum on Sichuan North Road, is being organized at the request of the Shanghai Municipality to celebrate New Year's Day. Preparations have been underway for nearly three weeks. Public and private institutions and collectors from all over the world have been organizing exhibits and sending them to the exhibition. In addition to the large number of exhibits that have already been sent, those who have contacted us and are ready to send exhibits include the Historical Materials Bureau of the Ministry of National Defense, the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee, the Youth League, the Association of Martyred Comrades, the Beiping Library, the Municipal Gazetteer Office, the China News Photography Agency, and members of the Collection Association chaired by Qian Huafo. It is also reported that the Municipal Party Committee, in order to assist the exhibition, has issued orders to its subordinate district departments to solicit exhibits, and has invited the assistance of the Literary and Art Movement Committee and Messrs. Wu Kaixian, Wu Shaoshu, and Wu Rencang to solicit exhibits.</p>
<h3>Two Captured New Fourth Army Soldiers; The District Court Decides Not to Accept the Case</h3>
<p>[Our Own Correspondent] New Fourth Army soldiers Zhao Xiaogui and Xu Caixing were captured last year during the attack on the Zhongjiu Army in Qibao Town. They were transferred and tried by the Sino-American Cooperative Organization, the High Prosecutor's Office, the District Prosecutor's Office, and the High Court. The High Court tried them as a case of internal disorder. Recently, they were transferred to the District Court for trial again. After a detailed study by Judge Cao Zusi, it was determined that there was no need for a substantive trial of the two men, and the charges were insufficient to establish a case. Although the High Court had tried the case as one of internal disorder, there was no appropriate legal provision to punish them. Therefore, it is reported that the District Court has decided to dismiss the case and will announce the verdict today. If the prosecutor's office does not object within ten days after the judgment is delivered, the two men can be released.</p>
<h3>The Old Case of Tang Yuhan Is Reopened; The District Court Will Issue an Arrest Warrant</h3>
<p>Tang Yuhan, the husband of Chen Yunshang, was formerly the director of the Sino-Belgian Radium Therapy Hospital. In May of last year, Yang Wangshi, the sister of Wang Jinwen, had a tumor in her abdomen and a uterine tumor. She went to the hospital for treatment and died. At that time, her family filed a complaint with the puppet local prosecutor's office, accusing Tang of negligent injury causing death. However, the Japanese invaders surrendered soon after, causing the case to be shelved. Now the case has been reopened by Prosecutor Ding Tongjun of the District Prosecutor's Office, who believes that Tang is guilty of negligent homicide due to medication errors and has formally filed a public prosecution. However, Tang is still suspected of being a traitor, so he fled without a trace after the victory. The District Court may issue an arrest warrant to bring him to justice for questioning.</p>

<h3>Restricting Electricity Use for Ordinary Households Is Ineffective; Doubts Arise About the Effectiveness of the Public Works Bureau's Implementation; A Subcommittee of the City Council Raises Questions</h3>
<p>The Regulations Committee of the Shanghai Municipal Council held its sixth meeting at 3:00 PM yesterday afternoon. Ten councilors attended, chaired by Ma Junshuo. Officials from the Land Administration Bureau, the Tax Bureau, and the Public Works, Civil Engineering, and Social Affairs Bureaus were all sent to participate and review several regulations. The draft of the Shanghai Municipal Measures for the Management of Municipally Owned Real Estate and the draft of the Shanghai Municipal Measures for Rewarding the Development of Public Land were both passed or amended and passed. At the meeting, Ma Junshuo questioned the Public Works Bureau about the effectiveness of the electricity restriction method. The original question was as follows: Recently, I have heard from two citizens that they believe that restricting electricity use for ordinary households is unnecessary. Their reason is that electricity use by ordinary households accounts for at most 15% of total electricity use, of which those using less than 20 kWh account for 9%. That is, the restricted users account for 6% to 7% of the total. Then the electricity saved is only 1.8% of the total electricity use, which is very small and ineffective. Moreover, ordinary households mostly turn on their lights from 6:00 PM to 9:00 PM. Since there is no time limit, it is actually impossible to save electricity. It is also reported that the raw material used by the power company is diesel, not coal. Diesel can be supplied continuously by the United States, and the generator is being repaired. Then is it currently necessary to restrict electricity use for ordinary households? This is a question. Please ask the Public Works Bureau and the Chief Secretary to ask Director Zhao to answer in detail. Chief Secretary Yuan then stated: Today, because I did not bring the materials to the meeting, I will answer next time.</p>
<p>Complete the Pudong Avenue</p>
<p>[Our Own Correspondent] The Municipal Council quickly received proposals from the councilors for the second conference. As of last night, there were eleven. Councilors Zhong Wangliang, Qu Yue, and Zhu Wende proposed the "Complete Pudong Avenue" case, stating that: "Pudong is more than thirty miles away from the city center, and transportation relies only on waterways, which still cannot facilitate travel, especially since there are many factory workers in the suburbs. The exchange of agricultural products and commodities cannot be smoothly carried out without the development of land transportation. The original roadbed of Pudong Avenue starts from Donggou and connects to Shanghai. The southern route has already been completed. The section north to Wanqiao in this district, which is twelve li, should be built quickly to facilitate transportation."</p>
<h3>"Killing the Chicken to Get the Eggs"; Heavy Taxes and Levies Should Be Reduced; The City Council Will Discuss It Soon</h3>
<p>Municipal Councilors Lu Huimin and others suggested that the city's house tax, municipal construction tax, and all taxes are being increased, which does not seem to reflect the difficulties of merchants and residents. Moreover, foreign goods are pouring in, making it impossible for domestic industry and commerce to compete, and they are declining rapidly, even going bankrupt. Although there are many reasons for this, heavy taxes and levies are an important factor. Ordinary merchants cannot develop in legitimate commerce and have to resort to high-interest loans in order to survive. Now that the city's land price tax has been collected in November 1946, and the municipal expenses have been settled, there is no need to continue collecting it, which is like "killing the chicken to get the eggs." Therefore, it is urgent to adapt to reality and reduce the tax rate to provide relief and alleviate the people's difficulties. Therefore, it is specifically suggested that municipal expenses should be paid from the land price tax. If there is a shortage, please ask the Executive Yuan to order the Ministry of Finance to allocate funds to subsidize it. The Secretariat of the Council has already submitted this proposal to the second conference for discussion.</p>
<h3>Shenhe and Labor Disputes; A Settlement Record Was Established</h3>
<p>[Our Own Correspondent] The issue of adjusting the wages of the Shenhe Rubber Factory, which employs 500 workers, was resolved yesterday.

As for the wages for November and half a month of this month, they will be paid in full before the end of the lunar year. (2) The factory will adjust the wages itself in the shortest possible time. (3) The year-end bonus will be one month's salary, which will be calculated before the end of the solar year and paid before the end of the lunar year. (4) Starting from January of next lunar year, salaries will be paid on the 5th and 20th of each month. (5) Workers shall not be dismissed without reason or pretext. If a worker is dismissed for misconduct, it must be approved by the Social Affairs Bureau. (6) Workers in both factories shall not engage in strikes, except in cases where the machines malfunction or there is a shortage of raw materials.</p>
<h3>The French Electric Tram Company's Year-End Bonus Has Been Submitted to the Social Affairs Bureau for Mediation</h3>
<p>[Our Own Correspondent] The issue of adjusting the wages of the French Electric Tram Company has just been resolved, and the issue of the year-end bonus has followed. According to the contract signed by labor and management, the labor side can get a year-end bonus of two months' salary, but the management side stated that it cannot fulfill this according to the government's regulations. At the same time, the labor side pointed out that the French Electric Power Company has made a lot of profit, but the company is unwilling to admit it. This matter has been submitted to the Social Affairs Bureau for mediation, and it is feared that the company's accounts will be investigated.</p>

<h3>Should the Exclusive Operating Contract of the British Electric Tram Company Be Recovered After Expiration? Awaiting a Decision by the City Council; The Executive Yuan Has Already Replied to the Water Supply Issue by Telegram</h3>
<p>[Our Own Correspondent] The exclusive operating contract signed between the British Shanghai Electric Tram Company and the former Public Concession Bureau stipulated a validity period of thirty-five years, from October 10, 1905, to October 10, 1940. Before the contract expired, the former Public Concession Bureau did not notify its termination, and it was automatically extended for seven years. According to this calculation, the contract will expire again on October 10 next year. According to the contract provisions, the company should be notified six months in advance of the decision to terminate it in order to assess the purchase price. It is reported that the municipal government intends to submit the case to the City Council for a decision. Therefore, whether the business will continue to be exclusively operated by the British Shanghai Electric Tram Company or be taken over by the municipal government will depend on the decision of the City Council. If it needs to be taken over by the municipal government, according to Mr. Bullock, the manager of the British Electric Tram Company, it will cost approximately US$6 million.</p>
<p>[Another News] The exclusive operating contract of the British Shanghai Water Company in this city is about to expire on January 1 next year. The issue of whether to extend it or take it back was previously submitted to the Executive Yuan by the City Council for instructions. Now the Executive Yuan has replied by telegram, stating: "The contract of the British Shanghai Water Company in Shanghai has expired. In principle, it should be taken back by the Shanghai Municipal Government and operated publicly. Even if there are temporary financial difficulties and funds are not easily available, the extension should not be too long, at most five years, so as to maintain room for flexibility and to prepare a proper plan for taking it back as soon as possible. It has been ordered that the Shanghai Municipal Government comply and implement it."</p>
<h3>Huang Liewen, Who Killed Martyr Du Gang, Is Sentenced to 15 Years</h3>
<p>The Case of Fifteen Murders Is Retried; Zou Baoshen Acts As If Nothing Happened; Chen Amu Doesn't Know What He's Talking About</p>
<p>[Our Own Correspondent] Huang Liewen, the former puppet Qingpu County Magistrate, secretly reported Du Gang, a member of the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee, to the enemy, resulting in Du's death. Yesterday morning, the High Court sentenced him to fifteen years of imprisonment, deprivation of civil rights for ten years, and confiscation of his property, except for a reasonable amount left for the living expenses of his family.</p>
<p>[Our Own Correspondent] Zou Baoxian, the former puppet Xi'an Township Chief of Qingpu County, and Xue Shunde, Chen Amu, Yang Ada, Yu Kesheng, and others, who were accused of killing fifteen people, were tried on the 13th. Yesterday morning, the Second Criminal Tribunal of the High Court continued the trial. Zou Baoshen had a new haircut and was wearing a gray-patterned cotton robe. He was calm when answering questions and denied directing the killing of fifteen people, saying that he was attending a meeting at the Qiaoqu Township Office that day. The guarantor, Lu Zongzhao, was then summoned. Because the murderer, Yang Ada, had fled, the guarantor was ordered to find him within a time limit and was guaranteed by Xiao Fumin. Another defendant, Chen Amu, had a shaved head and was in a very pitiful state. He gave irrelevant answers. The court hearing was adjourned and the defendants were taken back into custody.</p>
<h3>Sha Jingchuan and Yu Zhongru; Preliminary Hearing</h3>
<p>[Our Own Correspondent] Sha Jingchuan (i.e., Sha Keliang) and Yu Zhongru were accused by the Resources Committee of secretly reporting the case files and materials that the Resources Committee and the Public Works Bureau had left in Shanghai for safekeeping to the enemy and puppets. Sha and Yu then joined the puppet Public Works Bureau as clerks. The High Prosecutor's Office prosecuted them for suspicion of being traitors. Yesterday afternoon, the High Court held a hearing. The defendants requested to review the files of the puppet Public Works Bureau that were received by the municipal government and to summon witnesses. The court hearing was adjourned.</p>
<p>It is reported that Sha Jingchuan is 40 years old and Yu Zhongru is 37 years old. Both are from Zhenhai, Zhejiang. Before the war, they both worked in the Accounting Section of the Shanghai Municipal Public Works Bureau. After the outbreak of the "August 13" Shanghai War, they were ordered to disperse. At the end of 1939, Sha served as a clerk in the Hong Kong Purchasing Office of the Resources Committee. He took leave to return to Shanghai in May 1941. On August 8 of the same year, Sha and Yu jointly submitted a request to the puppet Public Works Bureau to resume their positions. They were immediately appointed as clerks in the bureau and secretly reported the Hengli Company, a material purchasing agency secretly set up by the Resources Committee at 515 Cishu Building in Shanghai, and the case files and materials left in Shanghai for safekeeping by the former Public Works Bureau to the enemy and puppets, resulting in all the equipment and funds of the bureau being confiscated. In addition, 40 boxes of public goods stored in the First Warehouse of the Shanghai Bank on Suzhou Road were also seized by the puppet Public Works Bureau. Sha Jingchuan received a bonus of 3,000 puppet currency for this, and Yu Zhongru received 1,000 yuan. After the victory, Sha and Yu continued to work for the municipal government. Now, after being reported by the Resources Committee, the High Court held a hearing in the afternoon. The two defendants confessed that they took up puppet positions because they were forced by livelihood. They did not remember whether the confiscation of case files and materials of the Resources Committee and the Public Works Bureau by the enemy and puppets was due to their secret reports. They requested the court to review the files of the puppet Public Works Bureau. The court also summoned witnesses Ying Yeci and Jiang Zihua to testify about the circumstances of Sha and Yu's defection and secret reports. Because further investigation was needed, the court hearing was adjourned.</p>
<h3>Social Services Reader Consultation</h3>
<p>Legal Queries</p>
<p>(1) Roman Injury</p>
<p>Jiang Biyuan asks:</p>
<p>A child, while playing with several companions on the lawn in front of neighbor Mr. Jia's house, was severely injured by a horse raised by Mr. Jia (the left eye is now blind). At the time of the incident, the horse was tied to a tree. After the incident, the child's parents demanded that Mr. Jia compensate for all losses, a considerable sum. Mr. Jia, a commoner, cannot afford such a large amount of compensation. According to the law, how should this matter be resolved?</p>
<p>[Lawyer Zhu Yakui replies] According to the circumstances described in the letter, if Mr. Jia has done everything he can to prevent this accident, Mr. Jiang's side will not be able to claim compensation.</p>
<p>(2) Re-dealing with Old Debts</p>
<p>Huang Yan asks: Before the war, Mr. Jia borrowed 100 yuan in legal tender from Mr. Yi, with a written loan agreement stating an interest rate of 1.7% per month. However, Mr. Bing's name was listed on the loan agreement as a guarantor, but in reality, Mr. Bing was the creditor. During the war, Mr. Jia went to another place to make a living. Now, Mr. Yi sent someone to demand repayment of the debt, requesting that the price of rice at the time of the loan be used as the standard. It is said that the price of rice at that time was 10 yuan per dan, so they want to recover the current price of 12.5 dan of rice, plus interest. Is Mr. Yi's request legal? Please advise: (1) If the loan agreement does not specify rice as the standard, can Mr. Jia refuse his request? (2) What is the legal way to repay? (3) The annual interest of 20 yuan and 4 jiao has not been paid for seven years. How much should be paid? (4) Or should the principal be repaid a thousandfold; is this an already promulgated law?</p>
<p>[Lawyer Zhu Yakui replies] (1) Yes, Mr. Jia can refuse the request. (2, 3) According to Article 12 of the Supplementary Regulations for Handling Civil Litigation after Restoration, if, after a legal act is established, due to reasons not attributable to the parties, circumstances change, and the changes are beyond what could have been foreseen at the time, and the original effect of the act becomes obviously unfair, the court should make a fair judgment to increase or decrease the payment. (4) There is no such law.</p>

No. 14, No. 16, No. 76, No. 224, No. 187, and No. 229 all had appetite for taking in. After 3 o'clock, morale turned better, only the news of the reorganization of the Executive Yuan circulated, and Xian Yongxin Yarn returned to over 700 yuan, but No. 99 was still being sold.

<h3>Yisi Xingzhuang The Ministry of Finance Orders Another Crackdown</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Finance, in order to prevent speculative funds from fleeing to Hong Kong and to thoroughly investigate the evasion of overseas remittances, has decided to strictly crack down on domestic Xinzhuang that have arbitrarily established branch offices in Hong Kong. Recently, it reiterated its previous order, instructing the banking industry associations of various provinces and cities to inform their members to comply. The order is excerpted as follows: "It is imperative to crack down on the unauthorized establishment of branches by banking firms. The association is hereby ordered to inform its member firms that if there are any such circumstances, they should cancel the operation and report to the Ministry within five days of receiving this document. Any delay will be severely punished upon verification, and a report on the compliance situation should be submitted."</p>
<h3>Regulations for the Management of Silver Shops The Ministry of Finance Orders Abolition</h3>
<p>This reporter recently learned from the city's Silver Shops Association that the previously promulgated "Regulations for the Management of Silver Shops During Extraordinary Times" are no longer applicable and are abolished effective immediately. The association has instructed its members to take note, it is said.</p>
<h3>Woolen Fabric Industry Crisis on All Sides Only Seeking to Get Through the New Year</h3>
<p>With the New Year approaching, most of the woolen fabric industry is facing an awkward situation. Except for a few conservative old shops, all are facing crises on all sides. Generally, the responsible persons are worried. Because of the difficulty in lending and recovering money, the wind of defaulting and closing down is prevalent. High-interest loans must be repaid. At the same time, inventories are decreasing, and food expenses are increasing. Taxes and donations are heavy, and foreign goods are frequently transported in. Trying to cut prices for cash is extremely difficult. The current actual sales are that local customers are all subject to the mutual entanglement of high-interest loans, and the market is falling. Therefore, although there are various stimulating news of favorable purchases, the woolen fabric industry has never been able to recover. Both buyers and sellers only hope to get through the two New Years, which is considered lucky.</p>
<h3>Hardware Only Has Asking Prices</h3>
<p>Hardware prices are stimulated by foreign exchange and rise again. Chaos reigns, and most shops are closed and not selling. In reality, actual sales are still sluggish, resulting in only asking prices and no transactions.</p>
<h3>Sugar Price Surge Is Fierce</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market was still squeezed down by spot goods, and due to the gold relationship, it was even more crazy. Shantou initially opened at only 115,000 yuan, with a turnover of more than 200 bags.  Starting at 112,000 yuan, it rose straight to 130,000 yuan, accounting for 300 bags, a sharp increase of 230,000 yuan. Guangdong brought 40 bags of Hainan red, 149,000 yuan, a similar increase. Bo Pian Jiao 140,000 yuan. Xinghua Gang opened with high-quality powdered white at 177,000 yuan, followed by 172,000 yuan to 170,000 yuan,  Red at 162,000 yuan, more than 100  tens of bags,  A few dozen bags of Diaocheng, initially 115,000 yuan, then 120,000 yuan to 125,000 yuan. The Association's settlement also fluctuated by tens of thousands of yuan. Medium sugar, white and raw sugar were all in chaos. Only when Taiwan Sugar can ship goods, there is hope for stability.</p>
<h3>Northern Goods Also See Price Surge</h3>
<p>Northern goods have been sluggish for a long time, and have recently turned upwards. Among them, goods of   are even more tight, such as large-flake hall houses, which have risen to 310,000 yuan, Xianglian 580,000 yuan, wood ear 750,000 yuan, ordinary golden vegetables 256,000 yuan, and special high-quality called 300,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Rice Market Mostly Without Formal Transactions Edible Oil Surges Unprecedentedly! Soybean Cake and Miscellaneous Grains Are All Popular</h3>
<p>The rice market saw a total arrival of over 9,000 stones from the north and south. Northern japonica rice was scarce in supply, resulting in little trading. Indica rice was also lacking in both arrival and storage, and there were no formal transactions. However, southern japonica early rice and goods from the Suzhou-Wuxi area were still being received, and transactions were all conducted at reviewed prices. White yuan had no changes, and Yinyuan also saw little glory or disgrace. The oil market, due to the reported price increase in Qingdao, saw shops with strong appetite and competing to receive goods, resulting in another dramatic surge. Raw oil surged by 16,000 to 17,000 yuan, soybean oil also surged by 7,000 to 8,000 yuan, clear oil and sesame oil both surged by over 10,000 yuan. Soybean cake, due to strong demand in Taiwan and inquiries from Shantou, saw market prices suddenly rise by 1,000 yuan. Yellow soybeans were absorbed by local oil factories and the mainland, resulting in abnormal popularity, and continued to rise by 1,000 to 3,000 yuan. Mung beans followed suit and rose by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. Red beans were also actively traded, rising by another 2,000 yuan. Sesame seeds were selling briskly, and continued to rise by 4,000 yuan. Raw peanuts were also being purchased more strongly by Guangdong, and prices were gradually increasing, continuing to surge by 7,000 to 8,000 yuan. Corn also rose by 1,000 yuan. Wheat remained firm. Flour supply remained scarce, and the market situation became more prosperous, continuing to rise by 300 to 500 to 1,000 yuan. Bran saw active rural sales, rising by another 600 to 700 yuan.</p>
<p>Also, according to Director Ji of the Food Section of the Social Bureau, the city government currently controls more than 420,000 dan of rice in Shanghai. If the situation becomes tense, it can be sold to give speculators a fatal blow. However, this phenomenon is unlikely to occur when new grains are on the market. The monthly consumption of rice in Shanghai is 450,000 dan, so a supply of 15,000 dan per day is considered normal. Also, Ye Xinming, director of the Shanghai General Warehouse of the Ministry of Food, went to the Social Bureau yesterday to discuss the supply and management of rice in the city in the future. The Economic Administration Department of the Social Bureau dispatched three staff members yesterday, together with personnel from the Police Bureau and the Finance Bureau, to conduct a strict review of businesses dealing in rice, sugar, and cotton cloth to prevent speculative behavior.</p>
<h3>Yarn Allocation Issues The Fifth Phase of Yarn Allocation Will Be Temporarily Suspended New Measures Are Being Drafted</h3>
<p>Since the Cotton Yarn Re-Allocation Association has been handling yarn allocation, it has been through seven phases. Initially, the member associations receiving allocations numbered only six. Later, after factories in other locations stopped participating in the allocation, the remaining balance was participated in by three associations, including camel velvet, canvas, and webbing, and the number of units increased, and the work became more complicated. Repeated yarn allocations have resulted in various disputes due to the different situations of each industry, such as the allocated yarn not matching the count, incomplete types, uneven quantities, or occasional power outages and machine shutdowns. Although these technical difficulties have been discussed several times, they are still difficult to resolve. The association is now aware that the current trend of cotton yarn is that the authorities have the intention of "exchanging yarn for cotton" and restoring free trade. However, no matter how it changes, the re-allocation work will not be abolished. Since the fourth phase of the fourth yarn allocation is about to be completed, whether the fifth phase of yarn allocation will be implemented according to the new measures is still being studied by the authorities. Therefore, before the new measures are announced, the yarn allocation work may be temporarily suspended. Currently, the association has not clearly understood the yarn allocated to various industries and its uses. In order to improve future difficulties, it plans to take advantage of this slightly idle situation to investigate what counts of yarn are needed for what kind of finished products, one by one, so as to compile statistics and contribute to the relevant authorities for reference.</p>
<h3>Factory Yarn Sees More Fierce Increases</h3>
<p>Rayon Goods Follow Gold Prices Up and Down</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, gold yarn saw another fierce increase, causing the silk market to be extremely chaotic. In the afternoon, gold yarn fell back, and the silk market also softened. 120-count Dongyang Youguang rayon was trading at 760,000 yuan in the morning, and was asking 650,000 yuan in the afternoon. Gaoshan was trading at 700,000 yuan in the morning, and was asking for at least 500,000 yuan in the afternoon. The result was still a gain of 100,000 yuan compared to around 600,000 yuan last weekend. The prices of other counts of goods also increased by tens of thousands of yuan. The finished silk market was even more turbulent. Grade C was asking over 5.67 million yuan in the morning market, ordinary retail high-end goods were trading at 5 million yuan, and thousand goods were asking 3.78 million yuan, but none of them were traded. In the afternoon market, gold and banknotes fell sharply, and asking prices followed suit. The final price was not much different from last weekend. The situation of satin goods was the same. Quilt covers were asking over 950,000 yuan, and ge crepe broke through the 9,000 yuan mark. Huajin crepe was trading at 3,850 yuan in the morning, but because buyers were discouraged, the result was flat with last weekend.</p>
<h3>Yarn Prices Rise</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the yarn market rose with gold prices, and customers' buying interest remained sluggish. However, those in the industry held on tightly due to the high gold prices and did not easily sell off. Therefore, 20-count yarn rose by 50,000 to 60,000 yuan, and 42-count double-strand yarn also rose by as much as 100,000 yuan. In the morning, Shenxin Yarn Factory had 300 pieces of 20-count Tiannv Sanhua on offer, with a price of 2.25 million, all of which were absorbed by yarn dealers.</p>
<h3>Hong Kong Goods Orders Calculated Based on Gold</h3>
<p>According to authorities in the import and export industry, the number of major merchants in Shanghai who have moved to Hong Kong in recent months has been increasing day by day, and speculative funds from all over have gradually concentrated in Hong Kong. As a result, many Hong Kong firms ordering goods from Shanghai have recently calculated the price by converting to national currency based on gold, which is also one of the factors stimulating the recent rise in gold prices.</p>
<h3>Tianjin Yarn and Cloth are Decontrolled Industrial and Commercial Downturn Has Begun</h3>
<p>[Report from Tianjin, this newspaper, 23rd] The Tianjin security authorities recently issued a parallel executive order to decontrol the previously controlled cotton, yarn, and cloth, allowing merchants to conduct normal transportation and sales. Hardware and gasoline, etc., can also be released if there is a formal agency certificate. Also, due to the approaching New Year, general industrial and commercial businesses have recently begun to suffer from the downturn. The year-end accounts of various businesses mostly show losses. In recent days, more than 20 businesses have applied to the Bureau for closing down. Only banks and silver shops are thriving.</p>
<h3>American Wheat Arrives in Shanghai in Large Quantities</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The brokerage of Fulai Company, managed by Hugh Lucking Hogan, transported 8,580 tons of wheat from Seattle and other ports, which arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday and is currently docked at buoys No. 1 and No. 2 for unloading. The wheat is relief supplies transported by the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration.</p>
<h3>Downturn Strikes Again Chen Da Silver Shop Stops Exchange</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Yesterday, it was widely rumored in the market that Chengda Silver Shop on Sichuan Middle Road in this city had declared bankruptcy. After inquiry by reporters, it was learned that the shop had once failed to balance its accounts at the bill clearing house on the 14th of this month. Although it was cleared up on the 16th, deposit runs occurred on consecutive days in the past week, totaling 700 million yuan. The position felt short. After various efforts, it was still able to balance. However, a deposit run of 200 million yuan occurred on Saturday alone, causing the shop's account at the clearing house to be unable to balance again. Finally, the clearing house announced yesterday that it would stop the exchange and suspend business. According to a person in charge of the shop, the shop has a total deposit of 1.1 billion yuan, and the loan amount reaches 1.7 billion yuan, so there is still a surplus after offsetting income and expenditure. However, because the loan is more excessive, it is now being pursued. Once the clearing house's position is balanced, it will continue to operate. It is reported that the shop's head office is in Chongqing, and a branch is being prepared in Hong Kong. The Shanghai branch was only opened on September 16 this year.</p>
<h3>Zhengjiao Manager Wang Zhixin Talks About the Economic Situation in the Northeast</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Wang Zhixin, general manager of the Securities Exchange, flew to Shenyang, Changchun and other places on the 12th of last month to investigate the economic situation in the Northeast. He spent more than 30 days and gained a lot. The reporter paid a special visit yesterday and received the following remarks:</p>
<p>Any Chinese citizen who arrives in the Northeast will have a deep sense of national concept. Although my trip was short, I felt a lot. The first is excitement. The richness of the Northeast is truly like gold everywhere. In terms of agriculture, there are soybeans, sorghum, and wheat, which are sufficient for food and more. In terms of mineral deposits, there are coal, iron, copper, manganese, and gold, and the reserves are all used in the country. The mountains are full of forests, and wood cannot be used up. Animal husbandry is very developed, and there are rich fishery benefits. In terms of power, it is also uniquely endowed, with many places where hydropower can be used. Railways run through the entire territory, accounting for more than one-third of the country's railways. There is also a very long coastline. Rivers that can be navigated run vertically and horizontally. What should be especially pointed out is that the Northeast not only has rich resources, but also has a diligent and hardworking people. In short, the Northeast has the resources and manpower to achieve our country's prosperity and strength. China can be proud to have the Northeast! But another feeling is grief and indignation and vigilance. After the Northeast was occupied by the enemy on September 18, they actively developed and exploited it, and promoted the Second Five-Year Plan, including the invasive development and expansion of various economic sectors such as agriculture, forestry, minerals, industry, electricity, and international trade. They also planned to supplement it with extensive immigration measures. The depth of the plan and the scale of the plan all show the enemy's premeditation. Taking the Shenyang city area as an example, there are more than 1,300 enemy and puppet factories taken over by the government. The scale of heavy industry in other places can be compared with that of Britain and the United States. In addition, the construction work in cities such as Changchun and Shenyang is also magnificent. All these were gradually carried out in a short period of time before the Pacific War. Since September 18, the enemy has regarded the Northeast as a base for larger-scale aggression, so its urgent excavation of resources and the cruelty of enslaving the people are unprecedented. As a result, the people of the Northeast worked hard all year round but could not get enough to eat and keep warm. Those who witness the real situation in the Northeast, how can they not be grieved and indignant? However, their strength in management is indeed worthy of our vigilance and learning. The third feeling is anxiety. The economic construction of the Northeast has taken shape under the enemy's aggressive ambitions. After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, the government recruited outstanding talents from all over the country to prepare to take over. Unfortunately, it was restricted by the double forces of international and domestic forces. All the important equipment of the factories was repeatedly dismantled and destroyed one after another. The fruits of victory were lost. To this day, there is still a partial military stalemate. Transportation is difficult, and all economic recovery and industrial construction are extremely difficult. If this continues, the military cannot end as soon as possible, transportation cannot be restored as soon as possible, and politics cannot enter the right track as soon as possible. The seriousness of the situation in the Northeast and the suffering of the people, how can we imagine, deeply feel anxious. Moreover, not only anxious, but also worrying, the Northeast has a vast area and abundant resources, a large piece of good land, bordering a strong neighbor, it is inevitable to be coveted by others. In the past, it was ruled by the enemy for more than ten years. Today, the country is restored, if we still cannot be aware of the lessons of history, cannot turn hostility into friendship, and cannot quickly make politics clear and rebuild the economy to consolidate national defense and improve people's livelihood, then the tragedy of September 18 will be difficult to repeat! Combining my personal feelings, I hope that people across the country should pay attention to the Northeast, stabilize the Northeast, defend the Northeast, and build the Northeast.</p>
<p>The reporter then asked Wang about the future plans of the Securities Exchange. He said: It is hoped that all sectors of society can make full use of the securities exchange mechanism to issue new stocks or corporate bonds to achieve the goal of a true capital market. On this point, Wang specifically cited two examples: (1) Enemy and puppet industries received by the government, or large-scale state-owned enterprises that will be returned to private management, the Securities Exchange is eager to help when they need to raise funds. (2) Currently, the scale and capital of general industrial and commercial enterprises are not enough, and they will need to be expanded in the future. It is hoped that the funds needed can be raised through the Securities Exchange mechanism. Finally, Wang said: I hope that the Securities Exchange can play a role in assisting the country's economy.</p>

<h3>East Mongolia in Reconstruction</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent of this Newspaper in Northeast China, Han Qingtao</p>
<p>Shenyang, 10th (Air Dispatch)</p>
<p>In the narrow, elongated western region of Northeast China, there lives a nomadic people. There are leagues and banners, princes and nobles, and honest people. There are herds of cattle and sheep, and also people who have transitioned from nomadic life to farming. This is the well-known location of the Mongolian Banners in Northeast China, or what has recently been referred to in newspapers and magazines as "East Mongolia."</p>
<p>Glimpses of the Evolution of East Mongolia. East Mongolia refers to the area east of Inner and Outer Mongolia. It is roughly equivalent to Jehol Province, encompassing three leagues and two tribes, comprising thirty-eight or more banners. The Jerim League encompasses eleven banners, with seven in Liaobei Province, two in Nenjiang Province, one in Jilin Province, and one in Songjiang Province. Next are the "Josutu League" and the "Joo-oda League," both in Jehol. The Josutu League has seven banners, and the Joo-oda League has nine. The two tribes are the "Hulunbuir Tribe" and the "Butha Tribe." The former has six banners and the latter has five, both located within Xing'an Province.</p>
<p>Before the September 18th Incident, the people here obeyed orders, were governed, diligently herded livestock, firmly believed in Buddhism, and rarely caused problems. During the era of Manchukuo, except for Jehol, this area was divided into four provinces: Southeast, Northeast, Northwest, and Southwest Xing'an. Later, for the sake of so-called "high-level national defense" and "border province" considerations, the three provinces of East, South, and West Xing'an, along with Liguo County of Longjiang Province, were merged to form a single Xing'an General Province, with the General Provincial Office located in Wangye Temple. The General Province was divided into several areas, each with a regional administrative office. As for North Xing'an Province, due to its proximity to Outer Mongolia and other special circumstances, it remained as it was, with the provincial office located in Hailar.</p>
<p>After the restoration, East Mongolia underwent changes and encountered problems. On August 12th of last year, the Soviet army arrived in Wangye Temple. Young people, under the leadership of Hafun'a, issued a declaration and established a so-called "East Mongolian People's Republic." In Hailar, people established their own "Autonomous Government," while in Qiqihar, there were other plans.</p>
<p>The National Government, the Chinese Communist Party, the Soviet Union, and Outer Mongolia were the targets of allegiance for East Mongolian politicians. Soon, the Communist forces entered East Mongolia. Hafun'a, a young man in his forties, had the closest relationship with the Chinese Communist Party and became the darling of the era. The Communist army followed, singing praises of supporting the East Mongolian Autonomous Movement. In politics, they established the "East Mongolian Autonomous Government," and militarily, they had the "East Mongolian People's Self-Defense Army." Cleansing and struggle began to unfold here, and everything began to change.</p>
<p>Distribution of Leagues and Banners</p>
<p>The province with the largest number of Mongolian Banners in Northeast China is Xing'an Province, which includes the "Hulunbuir Tribe" and the "Butha Tribe." The former includes the New Barag Right Banner, (adjacent to Qi Bin), the Old Barag Banner (adjacent to Hailar), the Ergun Left Banner (adjacent to Shiwei), the Ergun Right Banner (adjacent to Qigan), the Solon Banner (adjacent to Hailar), and the Butha Banner (adjacent to Jingxing and Zhalantun), among other six banners. The latter includes the Achai Banner (adjacent to Solon), the Morin Dawa Banner (adjacent to Buxi Bureau), the Bayan Banner (adjacent to Nenjiang), the Xizaga'er Banner (adjacent to Solon), and five other banners.</p>
<p>The ten banners under the Jerim League are scattered across the provinces of Nenjiang, Liaobei, Jilin, and Songjiang. Within Liaobei Province, there are the Khorchin Left Front Banner (adjacent to Kangping, Faku, and Zhangwu), the Khorchin Left Middle Banner (adjacent to Liaoyuan, Tongliao, Zhanyu, and Lubei), the Khorchin Left Rear Banner (adjacent to Kangping, Changtu, and Liaoyuan), the Khorchin Right Front Banner (adjacent to Tao'an and Tuquan), the Khorchin Right Middle Banner (adjacent to Tuquan and Zhanyu), the Khorchin Right Rear Banner, and the Jarbent Banner (adjacent to Tailai and Jingxing). Within Nenjiang Province, there are the Ikemin'an Banner (adjacent to Fuyu) and the Shulbert Banner (adjacent to Anda and Taikang). Within Jilin Province, there is the Gorlos Front Banner (adjacent to Qian'an, Changcen, Fuyu, and Nong'an). Within Songjiang Province, there is the Gorlos Rear Banner (adjacent to Zhaodong, Zhaozhou, Anbei, Hulan, Fuyu, and Shuangcheng).</p>
<p>Jehol Province has the Josutu League, which governs seven banners: the Kalachin Left Banner (adjacent to Jianping), the Kalachin Middle Banner (adjacent to Lingyuan), the Kalachin Right Banner, the Tumed Right Banner, the Tumed Left Banner (adjacent to Chaoyang), the Tumed Middle Banner (adjacent to Chaoyang), and the Kulun Banner. The Joo-oda League has the Bairin Left Banner (adjacent to Lindong), the Bairin Right Banner, the Ongniut Left Banner, the Ongniut Right Banner (adjacent to Chifeng), the Aru Khorchin Banner (adjacent to Tianshan), the Naiman Banner, the Jarut Banner (adjacent to Kailu), the Keshigten Banner (adjacent to Linxi and Jingpeng), and the Aohan Banner (adjacent to Jianping), among nine banners.</p>
<p>The above designations and affiliations represent the current system in the Mongolian Banners of Northeast China. According to a survey by the Northeast Headquarters Mongolian Banner Reconstruction Committee, Butha means the "Hunting Tribe" and is a geographic term, not an ethnic term. The Butha region is inhabited by tribes such as the Mongolian Daur, Solon, Gorlos Chun, Manchu, Chile, and Marneke. Before September 18th, East and West Butha were located in Heilongjiang Province and were not administrative units. During the Manchukuo period, most of the people of the eight banners of East and West Butha were relocated to West Butha. Currently, a portion of East Butha remains in Nehe County, Nenjiang. In addition, in Zhangwu County, Liaoning Province, there are approximately 30,000 Mongolian Suyike Banner herders who provide cattle and sheep for sacrifices at the Yong, Fu, and Zhao Mausoleums.</p>
<p>The Three Zones of East Mongolia</p>
<p>Someone who inspected the Mongolian areas reported that: The southern part of East Mongolia is the Jin-Re area, where most Mongolians have been assimilated by the Han Chinese, are accustomed to farming, and their habits are no different from those of the Han Chinese. Some Mongolians even do not speak the Mongolian language. There are instances of intermarriage between Mongolians and Han Chinese. Although Lamaism still exists, it is on the decline, because the entire society has been fully integrated into the Han Chinese. Therefore, even with Japanese instigation, it will not generate any significant impact.</p>
<p>The northern part is the former Xing'an Province area, where there are very few traces of Han Chinese. Mongolians still live their primitive lives. During the Manchukuo period, very few received Japanese education, and their minds are closed. They have no political demands.</p>
<p>The central part, south of Wangye Temple and north of Sira Muren, is the base of the East Mongolian Autonomous Movement. The situation is extremely complex. Except for the four counties of Kailu, Linxi, Tongliao, and Liquan, which are entirely Han Chinese, all other banners are inhabited by both Mongolians and Han Chinese. Indigenous Mongolians, because they are not accustomed to farming, live a nomadic life in undeveloped areas. In the developed areas, there are Han Chinese and Mongolians who have migrated from the Jin-Re area. Although this group of Mongolians has been sinicized, their ethnic consciousness has re-emerged, and they consider themselves the advanced elements of Mongolia. These are the people who have recently engaged in the East Mongolian Autonomous Movement. Indigenous Mongolians are merely led by them.</p>
<p>In East Mongolia, except for the southern part and a portion of the youth, Lamaism is still fervently believed by most. It is the destination of their spiritual life. Everyone fantasizes about the future where "one monk attains enlightenment, and nine generations ascend to heaven." Today, the advancing Mongolians plan to bring them to a world of high autonomy.</p>
<p>National Reconstruction of Leagues and Banners</p>
<p>The National Army, approaching the Mongolian Banners from the south and east, has already welcomed the Khorchin Left Banners in Liaobei Province into its embrace. Other Mongolian Banners are also rushing over. Now, let's introduce the Khorchin Left Front, Rear, and Middle Banners below.</p>
<p>The Khorchin Left Front Banner, also known as Binkang Banner, is one of the most culturally developed banners in East Mongolia. It is bordered by the Khorchin Rear Banner to the east, Faku and Zhangwu in Liaoning to the south, the Kulun Banner to the west, and the Left Middle Banner to the north. It covers an area of 90 li from east to west and 180 li from north to south, making it the smallest banner in the Jerim League. It has a population of approximately 116,000, with about 69,000 Han Chinese and 47,000 Mongolians. It is semi-agricultural and semi-pastoral. The agricultural production methods of the Mongolians are also very advanced. The banner government is located in Zhanggutai, and Uubao is the acting banner chief.</p>
<p>The Khorchin Left Rear Banner, also known as Bowang Banner, borders Liaoning Province to the east. It covers an area of approximately 180 li from east to west and 250 li from north to south. It has a population of 96,000, with 15,000 Han Chinese and 81,000 Mongolians. It is located in the Liao River basin and has many fertile lands. It is one of the earliest banners in the Jerim League to be cultivated. The banner government is located in Jiergalang, and Xige is the acting banner chief.</p>
<p>The Khorchin Left Middle Banner, also known as Darhan Banner, borders the Left Rear Banner to the south. It covers an area of 180 li from east to west and over 800 li from north to south. It has a population of approximately 250,000, with 50,000 Han Chinese and 200,000 Mongolians. The cultivation situation is quite good, and most people are engaged in agriculture, followed by animal husbandry. The banner government is located in Bayantala, and He Xiyelletu Moergen is the acting banner chief.</p>
<p>Finally, the Gorlos Front Banner of Jilin is located at the confluence of the Nenjiang and Songhua Rivers. It covers an area of 180 li from east to west and 300 li from north to south. It is the most agriculturally developed and fertile Mongolian Banner in Northeast China. The banner government is located in Nong'an, and Da Dimulin Dorji is the acting banner chief. The banner has a population of 170,000, with 125,000 Han Chinese and approximately 35,000 Mongolians.</p>
<p>The Kalachin Right Banner, Left Banner, and Middle Banner, the Tumed Left Banner, Right Banner, and Middle Banner, the Naiman Banner in Jehol, as well as the newly recovered Mongolian Banners in Nenjiang Province, will be introduced to you in the future.</p>
<p>How the Problems Arose</p>
<p>During the late Qing Dynasty, Han Chinese successively migrated into the Mongolian areas. During the Republic of China, immigration was promoted several times, and the influx of Han Chinese increased day by day. In the 29th year (of the Republic), Manchukuo, due to the complexity of the Mongolian-Han land issue and for the purpose of land registration, issued an order to Han Chinese farmers to pay 25 years' worth of rent in advance as the purchase price to obtain ownership of the land. This amount was deposited in the Manchukuo Central Bank, and the interest was allocated to the Mongolians. The Mongolians organized the Yusheng Association to serve as funding for Mongolian production and education. After the restoration, the Mongolians suffered losses and had no recourse for compensation. They could only demand rent from the Han Chinese farmers, who were unwilling to bear the rent twice. This caused great friction between the two parties.</p>
<p>In areas where counties and banners coexisted, Mongolians were governed by the Mongolian Banners, while Han Chinese belonged to the county government. Minor disputes would be taken by Mongolians to the Mongolian Banners, while Han Chinese would appeal to the county government. The county and banner were loosely connected and unable to resolve the issues. Consequently, each would escalate the matter to higher-level authorities, adding embellishments and exaggerations, making it impossible to resolve. Emotions gradually became alienated and deteriorated.</p>
<p>The Manchukuo – or, to be more direct, the Japanese officials – paid considerable attention to Mongolian education, but the purpose of education was different. Seeing that the educational policy they formulated included the following: "The basic policy is to separate the previously joint Han-Mongolian education, and on the one hand, improve Mongolian secondary schools in order to cultivate key personnel," one can already understand the general idea.</p>
<p>Japanese officials used a two-pronged approach of education and politics to alienate the relationship between Han Chinese and Mongolians, dividing them into three classes politically: Japanese, Mongolians, and Han Chinese. Japanese and Mongolian were used in schools, and Japanese and Mongolian were spoken. Here, Mongolians were treated better than Han Chinese. These policies played a significant role in division and isolation. It is said that those who were dissatisfied with everything were mostly students from the "Xing'an Normal School" in Zhalantun and the "Xing'an College" in Wangye Temple.</p>
<p>What Mongolians Need</p>
<p>The Northeast Administrative Office established a "Mongolian Banner Reconstruction Committee" to handle the reconstruction of the Mongolian Banners. They are assisting the provincial governments and Mongolian Banners in the localities of the Mongolian Banners to intensify the reconstruction work. They are conducting registration of Mongolian talents and sending many work groups to the Mongolian Banner areas. Their policies can take the opinions of Mongolian people into account regarding the issue of human rights in the future Mongolian civil administration, so as to avoid repeating the past mistakes of division and appeasement.</p>
<p>Fellow Han Chinese compatriots in the Mongolian Banners of Northeast China have established a "Northeast Mongolian Banner Committee" in Shenyang. They have organized several Northeast Mongolian Banner Self-Defense Forces to assist the government and the National Army in receiving the Mongolian Banners. They have also organized a military work group to advance with the National Army, engaging in pacification and propaganda work. They also plan to publish a "New Mongolia Guide," and they are currently preparing and raising funds in order to compile and print news in both Chinese and Mongolian, as well as engaging in writing and theorizing to break down barriers. This is the only public organization of Mongolians in Shenyang.</p>
<p>The general opinion is that attention should be paid to the livelihood issues of Mongolians in the future, and the main thing is to call on them to stabilize their lives. If it is possible to improve their animal husbandry by using scientific methods based on the Mongolian living environment, establish pastures in different areas to prevent the spread of animal diseases, and increase their wealth calculated in cattle and sheep on a daily basis, and then select sites to establish leather and woolen textile industries, then the living standards of Mongolian compatriots will inevitably improve day by day. As for restoring and constructing transportation and popularizing education, these can be carried out successively. Once the economic foundation is established, the political status and local autonomy can be smoothly completed. Some people also advocate that since people of Mongolian, Han, and other ethnic groups live together, banners and counties can still coexist, but legal mutual governance must be implemented, and at the same time, policies to protect animal husbandry must be implemented to prevent the over-cultivation of good pastures. Ethnic minorities need reasonable survival and development, and there is no need to specialize.</p>
<p>Currently, many Mongolian representatives, at the "Temporary University" conference, as well as expressing appeals to all sectors of society, hope that the interests of ethnic minorities should be taken into account in the constitution, and the banner system must also obtain a reasonable status in the constitution. The general opinion here is that if there is a good solution, although the banner system is a remnant of the feudal era, the Mongolians are accustomed to it, and it may be okay to let it exist for a while. Of course, the government should pay extra attention to the interests of ethnic minorities.</p>

<h3>Journey to Taitung (II) The Warm Current of the Pacific Ocean</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent of This Newspaper, Jiang Muyun</p>
<p>Two Harbors: Karrulan · Shinkō</p>
<p>Taipei, 12th (Air Dispatch)</p>
<p>As the only lifeline of eastern Taiwan, it is the warm current of the Pacific Ocean (Kuroshio). This current flows from the North Equatorial region, passes through the Philippines, runs along the coast of Taitung, and flows directly into the Sea of Japan. It nourishes the remote eastern Taiwan, and the people of the east regard it as a deity, relying on this warm current to maintain their lives. Because this warm current is most able to attract the clustering of fish, the fishermen are now no longer poor. Adventurous hunting and catching of floating fish enable them to cope with the high cost of living. They are grateful for the warm current, and they depend on it for their lives.</p>
<p>Streams Impassable by Boats, Water Management is Especially Important</p>
<p>The inspection team and his party still took the original car along the county road northward on the morning of the 7th. This is a county road, and some parts have not yet been completed. We passed through the Taitung Bridge, which the Japanese admired as the "No. 1 in the Orient." This is an iron cable bridge. The Japanese loved this kind of architecture the most. Director Ren said that claiming to be the "No. 1 in the Orient" is inevitably boasting, but it can be regarded as a representative of the architecture of island bridges.</p>
<p>Fei Hua, Director of the Public Works Bureau, and Li Ye, two chief engineers, excitedly told reporters about the water conservancy problems in the northeast. Generally speaking, the ratio of the east and west coasts of He Wan to the watershed of the Central Mountain Range is one to two. The west already feels that the slope is too steep and difficult to manage. Not only is the slope of each stream in the east twice as large, but when entering the Taitung Rift Valley, it makes a sharp 90-degree turn and flows into the sea in the north and south. The large amount of gravel from 2,000 to 3,000 meters high is unable to enter the sea and all remains in the longitudinal valley. The end map is blocked, and the middle silting is increasing day by day. It is really like the water of the Yellow River coming from the sky, so building dams to block sand is not a solution, but it is necessary to attack the silt in the eastern stream and reduce the turbulence in order to maintain traffic safety and protect the existing cultivated land.</p>
<p>In the streams that are impassable by boats, the Japanese did not have the strength to repair the existing damaged dikes during the war. This year, the funds they have spent on building dikes have been considerable. The southern breakwater is about 600 meters long. The soil wall of the Xiuguluan River Yuli Dike was washed away. The dike in the lower reaches of the Xinwulu River, which is 2,450 meters long and protects 20,000 mu of cultivated land, was severely damaged by floods this year. Residents have requested speedy repairs, otherwise the aborigines will collectively go to the mountains. It has now been decided to repair it, with a construction cost of approximately 4 million yuan.</p>
<p>In the past, the Japanese forbade the aborigines from entering the mountains and tried their best to give them convenience to cultivate in the plains. The main reason for this was to prevent them from freely burning mountains and felling trees, which directly affected afforestation and further deepened the disasters of floods. Now the bureau is rushing to repair and build, hoping to protect their cultivated area and life.</p>
<p>Natural Harbor Karrulan, Decided to Maintain Traffic</p>
<p>There are several natural harbors in eastern Taiwan. The Japanese cooperated with the southward policy and used Taiwan as a base for aggression. Most of these harbors were used for military purposes.</p>
<p>After passing through the Taitung Bridge, we arrived at Karrulan Port. This is a natural harbor. The Japanese had already prepared to develop it here, and a part had already been built. The war forced them to stop. There is a large bay in the south of the harbor and a flat area in the north, which may become an excellent harbor. In the past, some ships docked here, and sugar and transport companies had warehouses. The first year's construction plan has a construction cost of NT$2.63 million. We looked into the distance on the embankment, and Huoshaodao was right in front of us. The warm current presents distinctly different colors near the shore and in the blue sea. Near the shore, rocks accumulate to form shallows. After inspection by Director Xu and Lin of the Port Affairs Bureau, it is not suitable for boats to stop, and it must be further developed. What is currently being considered is the value of building the port. There is no large amount of sugar and rice in this area. What can be used is when the Port of Taitung cannot stop operations, this place can provide a refuge during the windy season. Director Ren agreed to consider County Magistrate Xie's request to build Karrulan Port. At this time, he decided to open another eastern route starting next year, from Mulong to Suao, Hualien Port, Shinkō, Taitung, Huoshaodao, Hongtouyu, and even Kaohsiung. He said that this route will be temporarily scheduled for two flights per month, which is obviously a loss-making venture, but developing the east and facilitating and maintaining traffic is the first priority.</p>
<p>Eastern Taiwan seems to form another world because of the difficulty of transportation, the lack of travelers, the lack of regular ships, the lack of restored highway cars, especially during the windy season. Taiwan's two specialties are its masterpieces in the east: typhoons and earthquakes. Most typhoons land in the east, averaging more than three times a year, with the maximum wind speed being 61 meters per second. There are the most micro-earthquakes, with more than 1,000 sea earthquakes per year in the province, and more than 630 in the east. When the typhoon lands, it is followed by mountain floods, difficulty in water supply, and traffic disruption. The struggle of the people of eastern Taiwan and the local administrative agencies with nature is worthy of praise, especially the restoration of traffic at any time is even more worthy of admiration, and the decision on the traffic in the east, in addition to the highways that have been opened to traffic, the sailing of shipping is even more good news for the people of Taitung!</p>
<p>Taitung Fishing Port Shinkō is About to Revive and Grow</p>
<p>Taitung County governs three districts, sixteen townships, and one hundred villages. Shinkō, which is 51 meters northeast of the county seat, is a district and town. In the past, the Japanese praised it as representing the county. This is the only fishing port in the east. Originally, it was hoped that a port of 30,000 tons would be built. Fourteen years ago, the Japanese spent more than 800,000 yuan to build it into the current port, which can accommodate 80 fishing boats. There are two ship repair shops. In the past, it could manufacture fishing boats under 300 tons. Now, like the freezing yard, it is stagnant because the power is less than 200 K·w. Currently, there are 17 fishing boats. They drive into the warm current in the early morning and return to the base, which is three meters deep, at high tide. These fishermen were recruited by the Japanese every year, and in the first four years, they reached 250 people. More than 80 ships went to the sea to fish every day, with the highest annual output reaching more than 100,000 kilograms.</p>
<p>Appendix: In this article (1), the number of members of the Taitung Inspection Team should be corrected to 15 units, of which Zhu Gangfu, a specialist from the Department of Agriculture and Forestry, was omitted, and the song character of Li Chunsong was mistakenly written as the sheng character.

<h3>A Fulfilling Married Life</h3>
<p>— Pan Weiqin</p>
<p>Love is a beautiful love poem, but real life is a ledger. I have never seen a love poem that writes, "Rice is 60,000 yuan a stone, vegetables are 500 yuan a pound." Nor have I ever seen a ledger record, "In the silent, quiet moments, our hearts connected." This is the difference between love and real life.</p>
<p>Most young people in love are indulging in fantasy. They are thinking: "What kind of ceremony should we have when we get married? Where should we spend our beautiful honeymoon? How should we decorate the room? What color should the furniture in the room be painted?..." These questions are often discussed in low voices by the water's edge and under the shade of trees by almost every pair of lovers who are ready to get married. They all imagine a fulfilling married life. They believe that they will definitely enjoy a lot of happiness after marriage; however, in reality, marriage brings a series of practical problems.</p>
<p>Marriage is a lesson in life, and it cannot be built on those beautiful dreams. Marriage is the beginning of a family, and a family needs real life. Those who marry should first consider how to live after marriage? How will the income and expenses be managed after marriage? How to prepare for the cost of having a child... This series of problems cannot be avoided after marriage and requires you to answer them, unless you are a fellow who depends on inheritance and has no self-reliance. If you want to build a family on your own, but you have not deeply considered these many problems, and you get married rashly, then these many problems will stand in front of you, and the daily necessities of life may become the material for your quarrels. But before marriage, these many questions do not exist, just strolling in the park, watching movies, and saying sweet words. As for the things of daily necessities of life, they will not enter their minds at all. So we have only ever heard of "couples focused on daily necessities," how often have we heard of "lovers focused on daily necessities"? "Other people's wives are better," precisely because other people's wives will not come to nag you about those daily necessities. If other people's wives become your wives and also nag about daily necessities next to you, then your feeling will not be good. This is the change before and after marriage, and it is also a main reason why marriage makes love disappear.</p>
<p>However, the world is so big, and the scope of "marriage" and "love" is so broad that a simple answer like this will certainly not satisfy people. Is the breakdown of feelings between husband and wife only about daily necessities? Of course not. What is said above is only a more common phenomenon. Although many people do not have problems with their lives after marriage, and do not have to worry about daily necessities every day, it is inevitable that couples will gradually expose their shortcomings after being together for a long time, and sometimes they are unwilling to tolerate each other. As a result, the feelings before marriage and the original good impression of each other gradually fade, fade, and eventually disappear. Originally, what they saw of each other before marriage was mostly just an outward appearance, because on the one hand, they were deceived by emotions, thinking that any point of the other person was lovely and beautiful; on the other hand, both sides tried their best to conceal their shortcomings, leaving a good impression. But after marriage, becoming permanent partners, these shortcomings are difficult to conceal, and the power of emotional deception will eventually disappear one day. Therefore, "old couples" are mostly not as intimate as "newlyweds," and this is the reason.</p>
<p>There is also a type of man who thinks that after marrying a woman, this woman is "his," and he can do whatever he wants with her. Although when pursuing her, he was so humble, not hesitating to use all kinds of flattering means. But once married, he puts on the face of a "master of the house." They think that "fragrant bait is only used when the fish has not been caught." If this concept exists in the minds of men, it is the misfortune of women. I hope that women will pay more attention to this type of man.</p>
<p>In short, life after marriage requires mutual understanding and mutual help from both sides, so that the previous feelings can continue, and marriage will not become a tomb of love.</p>
<h3>Winter Children's Clothing</h3>
<p>— Zhao Ying</p>
<p>The purpose of clothing is to protect the body temperature of people and prevent it from being dissipated. Therefore, in winter, it is appropriate to use materials that are not easy to conduct heat, and soft woolen fabrics such as flannel are most suitable, followed by cotton clothes made of cotton cloth. Silk fabrics cannot protect body temperature in winter, and are not very suitable for hygiene except for their beauty.</p>
<p>Children's clothes should be loose and large, and should not be tightly bound to their bodies to prevent their development. Moreover, when clothes are too small, it takes a long time to change clothes, which can easily lead to colds and the risk of breaking hands and feet. Belts or buttons that are tightly bound to the body should also not be used, as they can easily injure the skin and hinder blood circulation, which can easily lead to various diseases. Tightly binding the lungs and causing difficulty in breathing is even more harmful.</p>
<p>The material of children's clothing should be soft and pliable, and coarse and hard materials that can easily scratch the skin should not be used. For the color, the lining must be white, so that any slight dirt can be seen. Even if not, light colors should be used. Dark and fading colors should not be used for either inner or outer clothing.</p>
<p>The thickness of children's clothing should be appropriate. It is not advisable to be too thin, and it is also not advisable to be too thick. Common people think that children's bodies are delicate and easily catch colds, and often dress them in clothes that are too thick. In fact, children's colds are more often caused by clothes that are too thick than by clothes that are too thin. This is because those who wear clothes that are too thick will definitely sweat a lot. When this large amount of sweat evaporates, it takes away a large amount of heat from the skin (physically known as heat of vaporization), causing the skin to suddenly feel cold and catch a cold. Moreover, those who sweat too much will gradually weaken their bodies, so the harm of clothes that are too thick is greater than that of being too thin. Just look at the children of the poor, who are naked all year round, and their bodies are extremely strong. This is because they have become accustomed to it, and the resistance of their skin has been enhanced, so there is no fear of catching a cold. It can be seen that strengthening the skin will enhance resistance, which can not only prevent colds, but also prevent various diseases, but the method of strengthening must be gradual, and if it is done too quickly, it will be harmful.</p>
<p>When children are indoors, there is no need to wear hats except in winter. Because the head is already protected by hair, if you wear a hat, it will be too warm, and there will be too much blood in the brain, which can easily cause headaches, brain swelling, and other diseases, and it will also hinder the development of intelligence. Therefore, Western men do not wear hats indoors, regardless of winter or summer. Therefore, from an early age, it is advisable to develop the habit of not wearing hats indoors. However, newborns need to wear hats in the first winter because their heads are not yet covered in hair, but in the second winter, they do not need to wear hats indoors.</p>
<p>Children's winter hats should be knitted with wool, which is light and soft, and should not be decorated with too much gold, silver, or other decorations, which would increase the weight.</p>
<p>Children's clothes and hats should be newly made. If old items have to be used, they must be boiled, sun-dried, and disinfected before they can be used.</p>
<h3>Common Sense for Housekeeping</h3>
<p>— Shun Ding</p>
<p>The glass chimney of kerosene lamps is most prone to cracking. When the glass chimney is newly purchased, it should be placed horizontally in a pot, filled with cold water, and the water must completely submerge the lamp chimney. Boil it, and stop after the water has boiled for a while. Wait for the water to cool and take it out, then the quality of the lamp chimney will be improved and it can be durable, and it is not easy to burst when used.</p>
<p>To prevent the paste from turning sour, add a little alum when making the paste.</p>
<p>After using the kerosene lamp chimney every day, it should be wiped with a piece of rough straw paper with a drop of kerosene sprinkled on it, so that it will be bright and luminous.</p>
<p>After the paper wall is pasted for a long time, its surface will inevitably be covered with dust, which is quite unsightly. If you use a piece of steamed bread, wiping the paper wall, it will be free of any dust and as bright as new.</p>
<p>When washing clothes, if you dissolve a little borax in hot water and soak the clothes you want to wash in this water, and then take them out, they will be as clean and white as new.</p>
<p>If a little salt is placed in the water of the vase and stirred, it will not crack even in severe cold.</p>
<p>If pears are stored with grapes in between, do not let them touch each other, and they can be kept from rotting even after a year.</p>
<h3>Women and Subjectivity</h3>
<p>— Liu Manyun</p>
<p>Even with more than four thousand years of patriarchal social life, thought patterns, and concepts still accompanying us, we still feel that subjectivity is inappropriate.</p>
<p>Women's superstitions, the erroneous concepts of educating children, etc. all come from subjectivity. Here, let's talk about the subjective results of their trivial daily lives:</p>
<p>First, let's talk about their attitude towards their husbands. Whenever their husbands come home late at night, their minds are always filled with these thoughts: "Maybe he met a girlfriend and is talking to her," "Maybe he is dancing with a dance hostess in the ballroom," "Maybe he is..." These many guesses brew her resentment, sadness, and grief, and she is very sure that he is doing this. So when her husband comes back, she has an iron face, first darkening the air, then quarreling... Even after her husband's explanation, she cannot eliminate her preconceived notions.</p>
<p>When she sees a relative or friend coming to borrow something, she is absolutely certain that he is coming to borrow money or seek a job... So she first gives people an embarrassing coldness, even if he just came to talk and relieve boredom.</p>
<p>She occasionally encounters a stranger with a tender face who will involuntarily blush, and always thinks that he must have done something guilty, so she guesses and misunderstands...</p>
<p>After hearing the neighbor's report: "The daughter of a certain family has been going out at night recently," then she will blurt out: "I wonder what kind of person her boyfriend is?" "Maybe she will get married soon?" "Perhaps she is already..." These subjectively-based stands that we are exposed to every day make us often unaware of our own mistakes. From this subjective attitude, misunderstandings, discord, and even tragedies may arise.</p>
<p>Even a criminal in court must go through investigation, collection of evidence, and debate procedures, let alone these people who may not actually have committed a crime?</p>
<p>Living in this era, everything must be observed and considered from a purely objective standpoint. If you observe accurately and judge fairly, then success and happiness will be yours.</p>

<h3>The Origin of Christmas</h3>
<p>— Dan Lin</p>
<p>The annual "universal celebration" of Christmas, many people, even some Christians, think that December 25th is the day Jesus was born. In fact, that's not true. However, what is the true date of Jesus' birth? That has become a historical mystery. For more than 1,900 years, no one has been able to answer it. We cannot find any definite and strong evidence from the Gospel of Matthew in the New Testament to the Book of Revelation, and from church history and world history. Even if we ask the bishops, priests, missionaries, and other missionaries to answer, we cannot get the correct date, because there is absolutely no description of the date of Jesus' birth in the New Testament Bible.</p>
<p>So why do Christians all over the world, and even non-Christians, use December 25th as a memorial to Jesus' birth? This is just a kind of "customary law" in church history, or it can only be said to be a "memorial" day. According to the explanation of Christmas in the "Bible Dictionary" (Note):</p>
<p>"This festival began to be observed in 300 AD. The Western Church designated December 25th as the day. The Eastern Church designated January 6th as the day. However, this is only the day designated by the Church, and there is no evidence for it. And no one observed this festival for hundreds of years after Jesus' birth, and it was only gradually implemented later that it began to be observed.)</p>
<p>Also, the "Encyclopedia of Ethics and Religion" (Note) says of "Christmas":</p>
<p>"...By the fourth century, the Church decided that Jesus' birth should be commemorated, and thereafter it became the common practice of the Church. The Gospels do not record the month or day of Jesus' birth, and we do not know what the ancients based their claim that December 25th was Christmas on. Some say that the Jewish religion originally had a festival on this day, so the ancients used it as the birthday of Jesus."</p>
<p>According to this, we know that December 25th is not the correct date of Jesus' birth, but only a "common practice of the Church" after the fourth century AD.</p>
<p>Originally, during the Roman era, after the Christian Church suffered great persecution from outside the church, the number of believers not only did not decrease, but instead increased sharply, the faith became more firm, missionary work became more effortful, and general undertakings were expanded many times over. As a result, churches in various places suddenly became prosperous. During this period, some enthusiastic believers were thinking of finding a suitable opportunity to commemorate the birth of Jesus once a year to show their respect and gratitude. However, there was no history to consult and no legacy to rely on, so there was no way to start. At that time, the clever missionaries took advantage of the environment at the time and replaced the local "Saturnalia" with Christmas Day, adopting the customs of the Romans celebrating the festival to represent the joy of Christians commemorating Jesus' birth. This day is now the commonly used Gregorian calendar December 25th.</p>
<p>Speaking of the Gregorian calendar, this year is 1946, but according to historical calculations, there is a difference of four years. However, the world has been using it for a long time, and there is no way to change it. This is something that anyone who studies Western history can know.</p>
<p>Exchanging Christmas cards is a recent thing. Around 1862, an English painter named William de Ryther created a kind of colored picture that was exceptionally beautiful and sent it to relatives and friends everywhere, attracting social attention. As a result, for decades, it has become a kind of souvenir that is exchanged to celebrate Christmas, and the post offices of various countries have stipulated dates for receiving and delivering mail during the winter every year.</p>
<p>Other things, such as lighting candles, are commonly used in Jewish holidays; hanging mistletoe and holly leaves in houses is a custom practiced by ancient British churches; burning firewood is a custom of worshiping natural objects in Europe, transplanting trees in courtyards, and hanging colored objects is a way for European people to have fun; dressing up as an old man with a happy face and giving gifts to children is an old custom of European people. Jesus' birth is close to the winter solstice festival in Western Europe, so many of the customs of the winter solstice festival have been incorporated into Christmas.</p>
<p>Note: The "Bible Dictionary" and the "Encyclopedia of Ethics and Religion" are both compiled and printed by the Shanghai Guangxue Society and are reference dictionaries for Christian missionaries and theology researchers.</p>
<h3>Window of Winter</h3>
<p>— Shusun Ruying</p>
<p>Snow</p>
<p>You came so quietly, after the red glow, after the delicate rain, after the northwest wind. The cold current from Siberia brought us the cold weather, but it also brought you. You, you, I have been yearning for more than a year!</p>
<p>You didn't forget my narrow courtyard, my holly tree, and my decaying grass; thank you for your visit, thank you for your stay, thank you for scattering snowflakes all over my roof.</p>
<p>You give me the confirmation of cold, the model of whiteness, the example of holiness, and the unprecedented joy of comfort.</p>
<p>You decorate the mountains and fields of winter, and you disinfect the seedbeds of plants for the coming spring. You serve the season and also mark the season. You give inspiration to poets and also become the subject of poets. You give the farmers who lack clothing the threat of severe cold, and also give them the hope of a bumper harvest next year.</p>
<p>If winter has no snow, just like spring has no flowers, summer has no thunderstorms, and autumn has no fallen leaves, how desolate this world will be!</p>
<p>Sunshine</p>
<p>The field worms cowering in the cracks in the wall welcome you, the birds flying on the branches welcome you, the green bamboo welcomes you, and the crucian carp in the pond welcomes you. All the creatures troubled by the cold are welcoming you from the bottom of their hearts, sunshine!</p>
<p>May you shine warmly. From the corner of the house in the west to the corner of the house in the east; from morning to dusk; from the slight cold in November to the severe cold in late winter; from the withering of chrysanthemums to the budding of plum blossoms.</p>
<p>You, sunshine, are the rebellion of cold, the source of warmth, the guarantee of growth and joy, the spring in winter, and the smile on the face of the angry.</p>
<p>You, sunshine, are most glorious in the darkness, warmest in the cold, withdrawing hope before despair, and bringing joy after pain.</p>
<p>You, sunshine, despise the crowd hiding by the water's edge, despise the lazy people who are greedy for quilts. You are with the farmers in the fields, with the youth in the open spaces, with the heroes fighting for freedom and justice, and with the innocent children.</p>
<p>You, sunshine, are like a mother's heart, like a military band on the march, like a high song during labor, like a belief during a decisive battle, and like a torch in a tunnel.</p>
<p>If it weren't for you, how would we get through this winter?</p>
<p>Window of Winter</p>
<p>Breathe on the window of winter, and white mist will stick to the glass on the window.</p>
<p>In this vast whiteness, what can you see?</p>
<p>Maybe you see cold, you see hunger, you see the icebergs of the Arctic and the snow on Changbai Mountain. Maybe you see the snowman you sculpted in your childhood, maybe you see the snow lamp lit by your grandmother's trembling hands, and you see her aging face, waiting for omens of good and bad luck. Maybe you see tomorrow, you see the rising sun, you see a flat road, you see a magnificent hall. Maybe you see your joy and your misty dreams.</p>
<p>However, maybe you see nothing at all, and the change of seasons cannot arouse a bit of your nostalgia and reverie.</p>
<p>Then, let you decide whether to stay or leave, in front of this winter window, in front of this grain of sand in the turbid current of life.</p>
<p>But I stand under the winter window, wanting to take a look at myself.</p>
<h3>Sails on the Great River (Photography)</h3>
<p>— Liu Xucang</p>
<h3>A Mock Love Letter—Imitating Ovid of Rome</h3>
<p>— Holy</p>
<p>First Letter</p>
<p>The autumn sky is so vast, yet my heart feels a strange shrinking and sorrow, an immortal infatuation deeply and persistently eroding my present life.</p>
<p>Can you ignore a young boy confessing such primal affection to you?</p>
<p>Perhaps you'll be indifferent to my *love at first sight*, but from late spring to early autumn, in the not-so-short, drawn-out summer, I've been struggling in the pond of my soul. I can't believe I've become so timid, secretly burying my unrestrained and eager sincerity and passion with my own hands. For countless long nights, I've cast distant reveries towards the Vatican, silently blessing your eternal youth.</p>
<p>Goethe praised a kind of one-sided, sublime yearning, and Turgenev tacitly approved of a pure and dormant love's anticipation. For these past few months, I've lived in this atmosphere of quietude. But why did you so carelessly stir up my surging emotions? A while ago, you wanted to "repay," and yesterday you breached the dam that I had fortified in my heart. I really should have written to you sooner, because I can no longer hold on: these magnificent years seem to be rushing past me so quickly.</p>
<p>If possible, tonight I earnestly await you at ××, hoping you will tread upon the blank spaces in my life.</p>
<p>The autumn night is like water, and it's time for me to silently pray for you again.</p>
<p>Second Letter</p>
<p>It is a stream of quiet warmth that has unfolded my life's yearning with such gentleness and solemnity…</p>
<p>In the autumn sun, I reverently recited your few consoling words that burst forth from your youth. The world seems to have molded a complete realm of imagination for you, and the shadow of the Garden of Eden tenderly covers my heart.</p>
<p>Like a martyr offering his life to truth for his faith, I have decided to present before you the sincerity of my earnest and flawless life; the life on the battlefield of these few years has entrusted me with my unrestrained love, which is my profound love of life. Away from a life of fighting, love will be hurt by the dust of the years, so, holding a kind and good expectation, hoping for the cultivation and inheritance of this love, therefore, I bravely and resolutely pour out my heart's desire and request to you.</p>
<p>However, you have always sealed my yearning with indifference. Is it that your health, like the deep melancholy of this late autumn, dwells in your heart? Tell me! This muted note shatters my heart into fragments in a silent melody! Can you gently repeat to me, "In autumn, there is our spring"!</p>
<p>I have already dissolved the shadow of my entire life into expectation, waiting for you to smile again, this smile will uncover the worries of my buried century!</p>
<p>Third Letter</p>
<p>I really dare not try to use trembling hands to extract the gold dust from so many settled memories, because I have already been sealed off from the most sublime passion by a cruel and bitter reality.</p>
<p>Yesterday I began to sip this rare bitter wine in life. In the autumn wind, with a childlike heart, what city is there left? I feel like I am galloping in the vast ocean. You should know that this is a ruthless persecution of a kind soul!</p>
<p>I still have to chew on the scraps of life you discarded to me. This century, this world, I have nothing to miss; I need stories, outpourings from your mouth, which will be the magnificent record of my whole life. I need poems, the soaring melodies composed by you, which will be the eternal rhythm of my longing life!</p>
<p>I have forgotten the joy and sorrow of the past few months, like a tired traveler on a journey trudging towards a post station, waiting for the "tomorrow" you give me!</p>
<p>Can you bear to let an innocent love languish and moan in the mire? I earnestly ask you.</p>
<p>Brief History of Musicians</p>
<h3>Haydn (P.J. Haydn)</h3>
<p>— Heaven</p>
<p>An Austrian, one of the "Three Masters of Vienna," he was extremely accomplished in creating "instrumental style." He was amiable and easygoing, so his works are also full of interest and cheerful colors. To this day, it can be said that there is no woman in the West who does not know "Papa Haydn." The word "Papa" describes Haydn's kind and gentle nature. Born in 1732, died in 1809.</p>
<h3>One Inch of Territory, One Inch of Blood 131</h3>
<p>— Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>Tsurumi planned to go to Konoe's villa that night to search for the "Seven Secret Letters," so as soon as he arrived at Anzaka's Chicken Farm, he immediately called Yano to rush to Tokyo as soon as dawn broke, ordering Number 012 to mobilize all personnel to prepare for action upon command; he ordered Yuanko to arrange internal support work, providing information about the villa every one to two hours. The morning information could be collected and sent by Yano; the afternoon information was to be transmitted to Anzaka by Number 012 on time. In addition, he called Yano to order "Number 03" and "Number 011," the two action commanders, one principal and one subordinate, to arrive at Anzaka Chicken Farm before 1:00 PM to listen to the plan and receive action orders. Regarding the future work trends of the China side's Changxindian Headquarters, he called Yano to instruct "Number 012" to handle it according to the approved requests on the information.</p>
<p>After Yano left, Tsurumi rested at Anzaka's place until about 9:30 AM. A car rushed to Tokyo, and he changed into his grade uniform at the apartment, ran to the General Staff Headquarters, and went to see his immediate superior, explaining that he had to rush back to the mainland that day; he inquired about the location, flights, and times of the military aircraft. Seeing that the last military plane was at 9:00 PM, he decided to take this flight to depart, and after the usual consultation with his superior, he took his leave.</p>
<p>With Tsurumi's departure date set, he went to the Black Dragon Society's action headquarters, nominally called "×× Club," to see several resident executive committee members, flattering them obsequiously, and asked for advice on future actions. Tsurumi was an employee and did not participate in local actions, so the committee members only said some official words of serving the country and loyalty to the society, and asked a few questions about Tsurumi's future movements, considering it a formality. Tsurumi made several farewell calls at the headquarters, one to Tsurumi Kiyoshi and one to Pingzi.</p>
<p>Tsurumi spent two hours rushing to complete the items that should be arranged in the secret plan before hurrying back to Anzaka's Chicken Farm.</p>
<p>Since Tsurumi was a person of interest to Tokyo's various secret societies, could it be that no one was monitoring or tracking his actions in these few hours? It was impossible! Please see this passage in the afternoon newspaper of that day, titled "Flying Here and There, Actions Unpredictable…; Minor Dignitary Tsurumi Tamashi Goes to the Mainland!" A subtitle read, "Re-enlisting, A Hero Comes Forth in His Youth!... The Late-Night Imperial Army Special Aircraft Takes Off, Departing at 9:00 PM, Wishing Victory with Success…!"</p>
<p>Since the news of Tsurumi's flight back to the mainland had been discovered, it was logical that someone should have followed him to Anzaka Chicken Farm, wasn't it? However, this was a bit difficult to do: because Tsurumi's actions at this time were all planned; in other words, he deliberately revealed his movements for what he wanted people to know, and of course, he used extraordinary and ingenious methods to extricate himself from the part he did not want people to know.</p>
<p>Moreover, at this time, the only ones who could match Tsurumi's cunning were the Fifth Column in general. However, the Fifth Column had to be controlled by Konoe. Since Konoe, the old fellow, had played that trick on Tsurumi the night before yesterday, thinking that he had tamed this unruly horse, he did not pay much attention to his actions. The hunting dogs of the Fifth Column, seeing that their master had let go of the reins, naturally did not interfere.</p>
<p>When Tsurumi rushed back to Anzaka Chicken Farm, there were already three people waiting there; one was Yano, one was Number 03, and one was Number 011.</p>
<p>Number 03, Ueno Bunsei, was a press photographer. After being expelled from a public orphanage at the age of sixteen, he wandered around the country for four years. Later, he went to various parts of Europe via Okinawa, Taiwan, Singapore, India, etc., working as a traveling beggar all the way, for ten years in total. By the time he returned to the homeland, he had become a very capable photographer, and he was also a member of a certain special secret society. Some people speculate that this secret society is a radical anarchist group. His acquaintance with Tsurumi was due to Anzaka's introduction.</p>

<h3>Christmas</h3>
<p>— Shao Fu</p>
<p>Hark! the herald angels sing,</p>
<p>Glory to the newborn King;</p>
<p>Peace on earth, and mercy mild,</p>
<p>God and sinners reconciled!</p>
<p>This song will fill every corner of the world today. Even non-Christians will feel a warmth and joy when they hear this song!</p>
<p>According to the Bible: Jesus was born in a manger in the town of Bethlehem. This humble place gave birth to the most sublime figure. We can verify Jesus's later saying, "For those who exalt themselves will be humbled," which can very well illustrate that humble origins are not enough to limit a person's achievements.</p>
<p>Traditionally, on this day, Santa Claus carries a heavy sock filled with all kinds of gifts, coming down from the chimney to visit every home.</p>
<p>The gifts in the sock have now become candies, cookies, toys, and even daily necessities. They are certainly in line with human nature and very practical, but they are too vulgar. In our opinion, the legendary sock may represent the meaning of infinite hope; coming down from the chimney explains warmth; and the white-haired, white-bearded old man represents kindness.</p>
<p>A few days ago, a New York dispatch from the US Information Service said that this year, the advertisements of various companies and stores show Santa Claus flying in an airplane, and his gifts are dropped by parachute, which seems to be progress. After reading this news, to be honest, we felt a little bit of horror, because that killing atmosphere will completely drive away this little bit of joy in the world.</p>
<h3>Bad Luck Befalls My Family</h3>
<p>— Ah Hui</p>
<p>In recent months, the food at home has been getting worse and worse, not as good as before. I think the biggest reason is that vegetables have become more expensive. Let's not talk about that for now. A month ago, my wife suddenly asked me for pocket money. I knew my wife was very frugal. She doesn't go to the theater, doesn't play cards, and is reluctant to eat well. She always manages to save some private money from the food budget, usually around four or five hundred thousand. She doesn't even trust putting it in the bank for interest. Where did all this money go? It really puzzled me.</p>
<p>Later, she told me that she had joined a "three-legged rotating credit association," each share being 100,000 yuan:</p>
<p>"They'll all mature next April. Each share will yield 1.5 million, three shares will be 4.5 million. Think about it, almost five million. How many years would you have to work to earn that!"</p>
<p>I smiled. She was very excited. I didn't want to dampen her enthusiasm. However, if the monthly payments were to be taken from the food budget, it wouldn't matter for me, but I couldn't bear it if the children didn't get enough to eat. So I told her: I'll try to scrape together the monthly payments. Don't cut back on the food anymore. I also told her that if there were any more credit associations in the future, she couldn't join them again. Otherwise, the whole family would have to go hungry.</p>
<p>"Don't worry, five million, we'll have five million next spring, isn't that enough?"</p>
<p>I smiled. Five million, it's really tempting.</p>
<p>The day before yesterday, my wife came home with a very bad complexion. The day before, she sat in the room staring blankly, not even cooking dinner. The children said they hadn't had lunch, just some biscuits. Mom had been sitting there, and the little ones were scared and cried.</p>
<p>I knew something had gone wrong with the "rotating credit association." I asked her, and she threw herself on the bed and sobbed. I comforted her with a smile:</p>
<p>"Forget it, we still have three million left, isn't that a big sum?"</p>
<p>She choked back sobs and replied that two legs had already collapsed the day before yesterday and yesterday, and another leg was about to break.</p>
<p>I kept comforting her, telling her that the children were important, that when they grow up, five million or ten million wouldn't matter. I told her to go cook dinner right away. At the same time, I felt relieved in my heart that I didn't have to "rack my brains" to scrape together the monthly payments anymore.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the dishes were better than usual. The children were eating happily, and my wife lowered her head and didn't say a word.</p>
<p>Just before going to bed, she calmly told me:</p>
<p>"The last leg has also collapsed."</p>
<h3>Opposing City-County Boundary Division for Fear of Heavy Taxes and Levies</h3>
<p>— Kang Shi</p>
<p>The newspaper on the 19th carried a "correspondence from Minhang" regarding the issue of dividing the boundaries between Shanghai City and County. Inspector Cheng Jing and others from the Ministry of Interior came to Minhang for inspection. Local groups and the public unanimously advocated retaining county governance, even to the point of forming processions to petition, posting slogans, and shouting slogans. This is indeed a topic worth discussing!</p>
<p>I returned to Minhang several times between summer and autumn and heard something about the division of Shanghai City and County. It is said that the proposal to incorporate Minhang Sanlin and other villages belonging to Shanghai County into Shanghai City had been brewing intensely since this spring. This time, Inspector Cheng and others from the Ministry of Interior came to Minhang precisely for this issue. Therefore, at that time, various groups and the public petitioned to retain county governance and oppose incorporation into the city.</p>
<p>From an objective point of view, upgrading a county to a city would naturally promote gradual progress in transportation construction and other aspects, which is indeed fortunate for the local area. However, the local public is instead petitioning to retain county governance and oppose incorporation into the city. What is the reason for this? The reason is that within the county, all kinds of taxes and levies are lighter than in the city. If it is incorporated into the city, then all taxes and levies will naturally be treated the same as in the city, even if the difference is reduced compared to the city, it will still be higher than in the county. Therefore, everyone is panicking, so they petition, post slogans, and shout slogans to seek to retain county governance!</p>
<p>As my hometown is located there, I am relatively clear about the commercial situation in Minhang, and I feel that this matter is of great importance, and I can't help but feel something. Since the victory, all industries have declined. In Minhang, due to the farmers' purchasing power being in a slump, various businesses have had no sales. If it is incorporated into the city, all business taxes, municipal taxes, etc., will inevitably increase. In these days of commercial hardship, how can people not panic?</p>
<p>Therefore, considering the people's interests and drawbacks, I hope that the authorities will plan the overall situation, so that the administration and the people can both benefit, that is "fortunate for governance."</p>
<h3>Tang Monk Meets a Swindler</h3>
<p>— Jian</p>
<p>The owner of the Baekel Road ×× cigarette shop, whose surname is Tang, is called Tang Monk because he is vegetarian, believes in Buddhism, and is kind by nature. The store employs three clerks and one apprentice. With small capital, they operate frugally, and the business is gradually developing. Recently, an apprentice about fifteen or sixteen years old often comes to buy cigarettes. When the store clerks are not busy, he likes to chat and joke around. The store clerks, because he is a regular customer, do not treat him coldly and often engage in casual conversation.</p>
<p>One morning, not long after the door opened, this apprentice came hurriedly with a small suitcase in his hand. He took out a check for 80,000 yuan from ×× Bank dated for that day from his pocket and said to the store clerks with concern: "I received an urgent letter from home last night saying that my father is seriously ill and I need to return home immediately. I asked the store owner for two months' salary in advance for expenses, but the store doesn't have enough cash, so they signed this check for me to use. However, the bank hasn't opened yet, and it's not a short distance to get there. Plus, the ship home is about to depart. Can you help me out and exchange it for cash?" He handed the check to a clerk to show that it was not counterfeit.</p>
<p>However, the cigarette store clerks are all shrewd and capable and know that bad checks are common nowadays. Those who are deceived are often heard of, so they flatly refused to do so and handed the check back. After receiving the check, the apprentice hesitated for a moment and said: "Well, then I'll just have to go myself, but it's tiring to carry this suitcase back and forth. Please do me a favor and keep it for me temporarily. I'll be back to pick it up within an hour." As he spoke, he put the suitcase on the counter. At this time, Tang Monk had come down from upstairs. Seeing the apprentice's pitiful situation, he agreed to his request. A clerk surnamed Xu casually put the suitcase on the ground inside the counter. The apprentice thanked him repeatedly and hurriedly bid farewell.</p>
<p>That day, the apprentice never returned. The next day, in the evening, two people dressed as fake military police came to ask about the apprentice's suitcase. They said: "That apprentice is not an apprentice, but a robber named Li Biao. He has now been arrested and interrogated. He confessed that Tang the owner is his accomplice and that there is a suitcase containing a pistol in the store," and so on. Upon hearing this, Tang Monk was panic-stricken and explained the situation of keeping the suitcase, strenuously clearing himself. At the same time, he handed over the suitcase. They pried it open to check. It contained several suits of worn clothes, but no pistol. However, there was a business card of Li Biao pasted inside the lid. At that time, the people came in a fierce manner, saying that Tang must be an accomplice and that they had to hand over the pistol and arrest him. At this time, the store clerks advocated reporting to the police, but Tang Monk did not want to cause trouble and only wanted a peaceful resolution. As a result, he offered 200,000 yuan, and the storm subsided. It can be seen that it is not easy to be a good person in Shanghai.</p>

<h3>What's the Use of a House?</h3>
<p>— Cai Xue</p>
<p>A real estate merchant is touting business to a modern young man.</p>
<p>Young man: "I don't need a house. I was born in a hospital, studied in a school, proposed in a car, got married in a church, and divorced in a court. I sleep in a hotel in the morning, drink tea in a cafe in the afternoon, and spend the night in a club. When I die, I'll be embalmed in a funeral home. All I need is a garage."</p>

<h3>Inside Story of Kidnappers</h3>
<p>— Jian Hua</p>
<p>Kidnapping is a variant of banditry, but they do have a strict organization and strong capital. For example, disguised rickshaw pullers, drivers, maids, etc., choose and observe certain families in advance. They secretly communicate information; such as finding and raising people who provide cars, guns, and watch the hostages; also such as the provision or lease of cars, pistols, hiding places, etc.; must be designed, directed, and capitalized by a leader. However, the above points are not the difficult problems of kidnappers. As long as the leader has flexible funds, and the talents of the gang are concentrated, it is not difficult to solve them and choose the fattest target to devour.</p>
<p>Finally, one thing</p>
<p>Their most difficult hurdle is the final stage of receiving the ransom after a deal is struck and a sum is agreed upon. Because kidnapping is a surprise secret action that takes advantage of people's unpreparedness, and it usually does not go wrong on the battlefield. As for contacting the ransom, it is done by telephone or communication, which is also an indirect action, and there is no worry about solving the case. Only receiving the ransom requires designating a location and sending someone to pick it up. This completely uncovered, blatant action often falls short, and there is a risk of all members being caught.</p>
<p>Therefore, they use all their ingenuity to design meticulously, with methods such as "drilling knife circle", "fishing for goldfish", and "catching garbage", in order to break through the crucial gate and get the ransom. For example, after the victim receives the letter from the kidnappers, when they are still watching and indecisive, or if there is a tendency to report to the police, they have their own informants to notify them, and they simply make a direct approach, pretending to be police officers, and enter the kidnapped person's home directly, explaining that your kidnapping case has been detected by the police, ask why you do not report and handle it privately, and secretly inform the ransom location and ransom amount, instructing them to prepare the full amount and go to arrest them on the expiration date, and that they must keep it secret and not let the bandits know, etc. If the victim is completely convinced, then when it comes to the time of payment, the same person is still sent, disguised as a rickshaw puller, to take the person paying the ransom to the designated location to carry out the handover, which is called "drilling knife circle". In case this plan is seen through by the other party, they use tearing up the ticket to threaten and take other methods</p>
<p>Fishing for Goldfish</p>
<p>The so-called "fishing for goldfish" is that the kidnappers notify the kidnapped person's family, asking them to seal gold bars in a cloth bag and throw them into a certain section of the Huangpu River. This method is easy to understand. Their main point is to make it difficult for the police to cope. After the gold bars are thrown into the Huangpu River, their gang has "water rats" lurking to retrieve them, but the time to retrieve them is impossible to guess. The bottom of the water is not like the ground, and it is impossible to wait for a long time, so it is also the most difficult to arrest.</p>
<p>Previously, a certain police station received a report from the victim, saying that the kidnappers had agreed on a certain day and time to take the ransom to a certain lane and throw it into the trash can (there was only one trash can in that lane), requesting to arrest them. At the appointed time, the police officers ambushed around, ready to catch the bandits, waiting for the victim to throw the money in. After a long time, there was no movement, and no one came to pick up the money. The police officers could not bear it any longer. Upon inspection, the bundle of ransom in the trash can was gone. Upon careful observation, they realized that a wall in the lane was connected to the trash can, and a hole had been drilled through it, so they could reach into the room and take things out of the trash can. As a result, the second landlord of the house being watched was arrested and punished by the police, and the kidnappers had already snatched the "special trash" and left the room empty.</p>
