<h3 id="c1">白魯德等今飛平轉瀋　東北停戰在商談中　周恩來可能赴瀋陽一行 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>〔本報南京十三日電〕大局在矛盾中發展，東北及冀，魯共軍燃起戰火，日益熾烈，而南京談判又呈開展徴象。馬歇爾兩日來頻謁蔣主席，並約晤周恩來，異常忙碌，聞馬帥謁主席時，曾詢及十五天停戰協定滿期後，有否準備永久解決辦法之計劃或任何方案，顯見馬歇爾盼能把握談判時效。其目前進行兩事，極為切實重要，（一）協助徐永昌與周恩來商談軍事問題，並召回白魯德，協助擬定東北停戰方案。（二）山俞大維直接與周恩來商談解決恢復交通問題。觀察家認為，雙方談判已進入具體階段。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十三日電〕白魯德將軍抵京，十三日晨十時曾往梅園新村訪晤周恩來，對有關東北停戰，派遣執行小組前往東北事，有所商談。聞白魯德定十四日偕李敏然·王守道同飛東北。軍調部東北執行分部人選，已定美方代表為白魯德教將軍，政府代表為蔡守廉將軍，中共代表為饒漱石將軍。今晚此訊傳出後，記者曾走訪關係方面某君，詢以東北停戰之希望，據談：軍調部東北執行分部之成立，能否卽可展開工作，尚須視東北共軍願否迅卽退出拉法以為斷。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十三日電〕白魯德將軍，定十四日飛平轉瀋，北平執行部交通管理科長希爾上校何日返平尚未定。十三日距停戰限期祇剩八天，現華北則戰報頻傳，政府正焦頭爛額，人民均憂心如　，而中共則仍以邊打邊談之老花樣，迷惑國人，困擾政府，新聞記者每日跑斷腿，得不到一點可以告慰於人民的消息，均大呼倒霉不置。今下午有人聽說周恩來將重訪馬使，有人說周氏正在靜候延安覆示中，據傳周氏已以馬使請求東北共軍退出拉法之建議電吿延安，現確在期待延安復電轉達馬歇爾，並傳在今後三日內大局將有重要發展，不致白等到廿二日。</p>
<p>〔本報瀋陽十三日電〕東北行營主任熊式輝，日內赴京謁蔣主席，並與各院部會洽商東北一切情形。</p>
<p>〔本報瀋陽十二日電〕中共代表饒漱石，向杜長官表示，周恩來一二日內可能來瀋，切商東北停戰問題，林彪亦可能赴瀋一行，但須俟周恩來抵瀋後再行決定。</p>
<p>〔聯合社南京十三日電〕周恩來稱：並未要求以延長停戰期限為繼續談判之代價。</p>
<p>〔本報北平十三日電〕權威方面人士語記者，東北軍事糾紛之澄淸，當不待十五日後，如共軍三日內不退出拉法，則國軍將不能坐視停戰命令之被撕毀。</p>
<h3 id="c2">馬帥邀晤俞大維　恢復交通事獲初步協議 <a href="#c2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>〔本報南京十三日電〕聞昨日馬歇爾·周恩來會談時，對恢復交通事，已獲致初步協議。今晨十時，交長俞大維復應邀往訪馬使，平軍調部交通管理科長希爾上校亦參加，會談約兩小時，內容仍未宣布。據某方透露，就過去三日來之交通會談結果觀察，中共對恢復交通事，雖已表示願意商談解決，但因目前中共日事擴大之軍事行動，已成復路事實上之極大障礙，設中共避重就輕，意存敷衍，將來如何確保修復工程進行時不再遭受阻擾，必須預先慎重計及，庶不致動而無功。付予馬使最後仲裁權，並加強執行部停戰小組，交通小組美方代表之仲裁權，尤屬必要。聞午日馬俞之交通會談，對此均曾討論，現正候周恩來答覆。</p>
<h3 id="c3">侵陷拉法共軍　續攻小孤家子 <a href="#c3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>〔中央社長春十三日電〕侵陷拉法之共軍，十日繼續西向小孤家子（拉法西六公里）地帶猛烈攻擊，駐守該地帶國軍，被迫自衛，至十一日晚，將其擊退。又駐守松花江北岸之國軍，十日晚被由陶賴昭附近竄來之共軍攻擊，至十二日晨國軍始將其逐退。</p>
<p>〔中央社瀋陽十三日電〕由析木城向海城東南英城子，前後馬風屯等地附近攻擊之共軍，於九日被國軍擊退，即向析木城逃逸，國軍僅恢復原有防地，並未向其追擊。</p>
<h3 id="c4">軍調部增派小組　赴蘇皖各地調處 <a href="#c4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>〔本報北平十三日電〕因各地衝突日見激烈，軍調部政府與中共兩方參謀長，昨下午特舉行會談，政府蔡參謀長提議，速增派小組赴山東調處，中共方面亦提出增派三小組赴蘇北及皖北調處，因北等地區衝突甚烈。結果決定：（一）派前由高密調回之第廿一小組赴濟南轉衝突地區，（二）新派三小組赴蘇北之如皋，高郵，及皖北之定遠，以上四小組，近日即出發。</p>
<h3 id="c5">關吉玉等抵平　梁華盛飛永吉 <a href="#c5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>〔中央社北平十三日電〕松講，嫩江兩省主席關吉玉，彭濟羣，十四日下午由滬飛抵平，預定與在平各省長交換意見後，當即飛瀋。</p>
<p>〔中央社長春十三日電〕吉林省府人員已陸續由長前往永吉，保安隊亦多乘車前往，梁兼主席華盛，將於十四日乘機飛永吉履新。</p>
<h3 id="c6">柯克飛返滬　克萊門派員晤陳毅 <a href="#c6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>〔合眾社南京十三日電〕某高級政府方面人士今晚指稱：馬歇爾將軍已對共軍進攻魯省，尤其靑島之舉，出而干預。該方面人士稱：昨馬使會晤周恩來時，曾「譴責」共軍開始攻擊魯省之舉動。同時某共方人士則於今日否認共軍有進攻靑島之任何意向。並確言彼處決不致發生事故。</p>
<p>〔合眾社靑島十三日電〕美第七艦隊司令柯克海軍上將與此間陸戰隊各長官會商之後，已於今日傍晚返抵上海。</p>
<p>〔中央社靑島十三日電〕美第七艦隊司令柯克上將十二日下午六時由京飛抵此，攜有蔣主席親筆下達警備部司令丁治磐之命令，對保衛靑島有所指示，柯克當召駐靑美陸戰隊司令克萊門少將等高級人員舉行會議，並邀丁司令參加，詳詢共軍近日進攻靑島市及外圍情形。</p>
<p>〔聯合社南京十三日電〕馬歇爾特使總部極關切靑島情勢，美第七艦隊兼在華美陸戰隊司令柯克上將，在飛靑島之前，來京與馬使會談，所談何事，渠未便討論，總部已接有關靑島發展之報告。</p>
<p>〔中央社靑島十三日電〕駐靑美陸戰隊司令克萊門少將　，十三日派納遜中校偕同中共代表郝鼎於十三日由靑乘美軍專機飛赴臨沂，訪晤共新四軍長陳毅，盼其制止共軍侵犯靑島及靑市外圍永源地之軍事行動。</p>

<p>筧橋在灰燼中再生　航空學校明日復校　（朱民威寄自杭州）</p>
<h3 id="c7">寂寞了九年的杭州筧橋航空學校的飛行課目，在六月十五日重又恢復了 <a href="#c7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>航校從民國廿年由中央軍校航空班改組成立後，到民國廿六年八·一三全面抗戰起，一共教育了六期飛將軍，「八·一四」杭市上空首戰，就是出這六期飛將軍揭開了空中抗敵的序幕。從此以後，六期數百飛將就血洒晴空，到處與敵機搏鬥，廿七年秋第七期畢業於昆明航校，從此不斷有新的血輸加入到空軍部隊中來，到第十一期畢業後，昆明航校因為在敵機空襲及補給汽油飛機困難下不得不外遷，美國慷慨承允幫忙，從十二期起，中高級飛行訓練即遷美實施，初級訓練仍在雲南境內。至民卅二年，始將初級班遷至印度西北部臘河施教，但教官仍為本國人，一直訓練到第廿五期為止。</p>
<p>航空學校的十五年歲月象徴了中國全部遭遇，最初五年她在埋頭苦練中準備抗日戰爭，第二個五年，她遍身鮮血淋漓，犧牲自己，保存領空的正氣，維護人民與戰地上的軍隊，最後五年，她轉敗為勝，得到盟邦助力，處處以充沛精力打擊敵軍，直到杭州筧橋航校原址重昇起國旗與空軍鷹旗</p>
<p>這個學校的以往史蹟，已表現於八年中國空軍戰史中，從白龍港撞死於敵艦上的沈崇誨，到江灣自殺敵團下的閻海文，巴蜀梁山上空單機擊落敵轟炸機三架的周志開，一日出動炸射衡陽圍城的敵軍八次的高又新，這都是航校的學生崇高的獻身成功表現，負責主辦這個學校的毛邦初，黃光銳，陳慶雲，周至柔諸將軍有榮矣。這些成千拋骨沙塲或擊毀敵機敵艦成功的空中英雄，給他們校長與國家的榮譽大於南開，淸華，燕京的學生們所予張伯苓，梅貽　，司徒等老校長的聲譽呵。只因戰爭結束了，英雄們的事蹟被埋藏在生活物資追求與分配的忙碌事象下，不再被認為有價值而受重視，歲月的流水又會慢慢蝕溶了她在中國獨立史上的深刻造形。杭州筧橋航校，這次在原地址復校，可以說是繼承以往光榮史蹟，準備創造未來風彩的一個紀念日子，六月十五日，長滿深草的筧橋機塲，被割除得光坦平實，由印度越駝峯飛回來的六十架絲蒂曼（Steaman．）教練機，排列得整齊，教官們飽受了十來年機塲風吹雨打日晒，以及八年戰爭中的辛勞與危險，挺立在他們所飛回來的教練機前，學生們（自廿四期至廿六期）　隊像新月，如新芽受着檢閱，杭州筧橋機塲上的這一個紀念日子，會永令人留下一個深刻印象。</p>
<h3 id="c8">靑島外圍戰激烈　芝藍莊被佔即墨巷戰中　共軍再度企圖登陸擊退 <a href="#c8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>〔本報南京十三日電〕軍息，膠東共軍由水陸兩路進攻靑島之軍事陰謀，現已受挫，共軍正由魯南，臨沂，莒縣，蒙陰及臨城，棗莊，嶧縣各地抽調兵力，向膠濟綫增援，國軍現堅守靑島外圍陣地，靑島美海軍陸戰隊正協助市區軍警維持治安，保護外僑。防守靑島之責任，則悉由國軍負拒，國軍因可由海空兩路支援，士氣極振，故靑島雖已宣告戒嚴，人心極安。</p>
<p>〔中央社靑島十三日電〕十二日深夜，共軍進擾白沙（距靑市五十里）及黃埠（距靑市六十五里）兩處水源地，投擲手溜彈，經我守軍還擊，激戰二小時，共軍相繼退去。</p>
<p>〔又電〕共軍二千人十三日晨，向我芝藍莊進犯，守軍以眾寡懸殊，卒被攻陷。</p>
<p>〔又電〕共軍攻陷膠縣後，近又結集重兵進攻即墨，十二日晚十時即墨城近郊砲戰甚烈，晚十時攻勢益猛，雙方傷亡均重。十三日下午一時即墨東關及西關即被共軍攻進，民房被砲擊起火，已展開巷戰。</p>
<p>〔又電〕十三日下午七時夕陽西下，共軍大帆船四艘（每艘約卅名）揚帆續犯團島（靑島市區西郊）強行登陸，並以機槍向島上射擊，經守軍與海軍發現立即還擊，全市砲聲隆隆，歷十餘分鍾，來犯船隻被擊沉三艘，餘一艘逃去。</p>
<p>永年發生巷戰</p>
<p>〔中央社北平十三日電〕猛攻永年之共軍，曾三次在西關登陸，均被我軍擊退，永年十二日東西北三關，被共軍突入，經激烈巷戰後，西北兩關共軍，於當晚被我軍擊退，夜間尚有電與此間軍方聯絡。</p>

<p>又共產軍於東北停戰命令生效後，在東北各地攻擊國軍之時，幷向山東全面及河北，山西各省交通發動猛烈攻勢，企圖呼應東北共產軍之作戰，幷乘勢陷城掠地，茲將各地軍事長官報告共產軍攻擊情形，綜述如次。</p>
<p>「山東方面」　共產軍七日向山東境內發動全面總攻擊，計（一）德州機塲八日晨被攻陷，德州城十日晚被攻陷，軍民被共軍砲火轟擊，死傷均重。（二）七日聊城被共軍一部侵入，旋經守軍逐去，刻仍在城關外續戰中。（三）泰安城被猛攻，迄仍激戰中。（四）韓莊運河鐵橋，九日被炸燬。（五）大汶口被猛攻，已發生巷戰。（六）歷城以西及以東迄韓倉（城東五公里）間之鐵路，濟南，泰安間之張夏靑楊樹段鐵路橋樑，七日晚均　破壞。（七）周村被猛攻，九日已情況不明。（八）張店於八日被攻陷。（九）昌樂，臨縣，高密均被共軍猛烈攻擊。（十）膠縣被共產軍攻入，現正激烈巷戰中。（十一）膠縣東北之藍村被攻擊，現已情況不明。（十二）靑島外圍之夏莊，黃埠水源地，流亭飛機塲，城陽車站，均遭共產軍猛烈攻擊。滄口至女姑口之間鐵橋，女姑口至城陽間路軌均被破壞。（十三）被圍已渝數月之棗莊，九日午後七時卅分共產軍復發動總攻，以炸藥炸燬其預掘通棗莊市內之坑道，炸毀守軍王綱指揮部，繼以重兵猛攻，致被突破，發生巷戰　，守軍指揮官王鋼，執行小組美方代表梅西亞，政府代表殷志強及隨員等，生死不明，隊長王繼美負傷，下落不明。（十四）濟南外圍被共軍猛攻，戰鬥激烈。</p>
<p>「河北方面」（一）共軍九日向長辛店（平漢綫上北平南）猛烈攻擊，守軍被迫自衛，將其逐退。（二）共產軍集結主力，包圍元氏，有攻城之勢。（三）共軍十日向被圍已逾九月之永年城復行發動攻擊，現在戰鬥中。</p>
<p>「山西方面」（一）共產軍八日拂曉分三路向中陽城東北猛攻七次。（二）七日晚同蒲路南段平根遙蘭間鐵路，被共軍破壞，平遙工務段八日派工三次前往搶修，均遭共產軍襲擊，被迫退回。</p>
<p>由以上事實以及過去自本年一月十日第一次停戰命令頒發後，共軍違反協定，疊次襲擊國軍之情形，觀其對於舉國熱望之全面和平，共軍毫不在意，本部茲就當前之局勢，作下列之聲明：（一）共軍應遵守一切協定及諾言，即日停止一切軍事行動，聽候調處。（二）共軍在此停戰期內，如再有攻城略地及襲擊國軍之行為，致引起國軍被迫自衛，共軍應負其責任。（三）政府忍讓求全之苦衷，自有其一定之限度，希望中共方面勿故作空談，節外生枝，以遷延時日，應着重事實之解決，集中精力，促成交通之恢復及整軍方案之實施，以期和平統一建國之實現。倘仍以此商談時期為可乘之機，變本加厲，致陷協商於無法進行，而造成嚴重之局面，則其責任，應由共方完全負之。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕重慶市府秘書長唐鴻烈，日昨因公來滬，發表談話稱：自中央還都後，重慶仍不失爲西南政治·經濟·文化·交通中心，現渝市府爲力謀都市建設之積極推展計，經奉蔣主席手令，擬訂十年建設計劃。修建兩江大橋，整修全市下水道及完成北區幹綫爲當前三件大事。北區幹綫工程，業已開始，預計三個月內可吿成，至於下水道整修工作。預計於開工後一牟內可完成，全部預算需卅四億五千餘萬元，已聘定美籍專家毛理爾氏負責設計，並向四聯總處借款廿億元，即可開始動工。其次爲兩江大橋工程，已呈准蔣主席撥補全部經費三分之一，刻正向行政院給領，幷向加拿大借款，惟工程浩大，重慶市府經呈准先行完成其中「中正橋」之修建。此橋位於東水門大碼頭至對岸之下龍門浩，全長九百八十公尺，橋分兩層，上層寬十二公尺，足供四輪汽車幷駛，下層人行道二條，各寬三公尺，供人力車及行人使用，全部工程費計六十餘億，定二年完成。已聘請橋樑專家茅以昇氏擔任處長，一俟行政院所撥三分之二經　領得後，即可動工。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕「行總」華盛頓分署長鄭寳南，此次回國後，曾參加「聯總」遠東區會議，近甫由京來滬，記者昨日往訪，鄭氏首述要求「聯總」延長在華工作時間事，據稱：此項要求已於大會中提出，歐洲方面亦頗有此意，中·英·美三國代表已草就提案並成立小組，擬於七月十七日（下次聯總遠東區大會會期）前決定，以提交八月二日在巴黎召開之聯總第五屆大會。鄭氏稱，此項要求之允準可能性極大。</p>
<p>關於交通工作方面，鄭氏云，目前之交通情形可分三段：第一段，自上海至南京·漢口·杭州·天津諸鐵路綫，可稱已能通行無阻，當前之工作着重於次段，即自漢口以下至衡陽長沙諸地，及第三段，自衡陽長沙以至內地偏僻小城間之交通，該項工作可望於今年秋季有圓滿結果。船隻運輸方面情形與陸地交通情形相同，亦分三段，現正着手將船隻運輸工具逐漸送往內地僻縣。</p>
<p>至此記者乃提出目前中國亟需解決之糧食問題，鄭氏謂，在此問題之前，吾人首先須認識一樁事實，即目前世界各地皆感糧食缺乏，非中國一地爲然，且各國皆有私見，以英國爲例，救濟暹羅自將先於中國。鄭氏鄭重指出，在今年六·七·八三月內，中國方面所收到之救濟糧食，當可大量增加，因歐洲之收穫期爲六月，在此時期內，所需之救濟量不多。記者繼問及行總及聯總在工作上當如何加强合作，關於此點，鄭氏稱，行總與聯總一向保持極好之關係，以後仍望更能合作。雙方皆有互相之批評，惟此種批評爲善意者，目的在使工作有更大之進展。　〔又訊〕鄒寳南氏昨晨離滬飛華盛頓。</p>

<p>財政糧食兩部召開的財糧會議，本月六日在南京開會，討論改革財政收支系統辦法曁調整省市縣收支預算等問題，已於十日閉幕，所議定的改訂辦法將自七月一日起實行。事關國計民生，尤其在財政支絀萬分，各省糧荒嚴重的今日，其意義格外重大。此次會議中，各方面對於田賦，糧食，稅收，預算四項問題所提出的議案不下百餘件，各與會者無不作最熱烈的爭辯與討論。最惹人注意的問題，一爲田賦徵實辦法延長一年，二爲調整各省市縣財政收支預算。此二問題，雖經會議决定實施辦法，但仍有闡明之必要。</p>
<p>現行財政收支系統，是民國三十年六月全國財政會議所决定的。當時我國正對日寇作殊死戰，亟需集中財力管制物資，以爭取勝利。因此决定實行田賦徵收實物辦法，並改革財政收支系統，將全國財政分爲國家財政與地方財政兩體系，而將省級財政取消。當時立法的原意，一方面增加國庫收入，一方面可以充實縣級稅源，以便推進新縣制，實行地方自治。無如在實際上佔地方稅百分之七十以上的田賦，雖歸中央直接收管，中央還是入不敷出。而地方政府則對於應辦各事如淸査戶口，整編保甲，以及淸丈土地等等，反多無力興辦。到了去年八月，抗戰勝利結束，全國復員迅速展開，實行憲政，爲期不遠，而地方自治尤須加緊推進，於是我國戰時的財政收支系統，時過境遷，自有立即修正的必要，省級財政更須恢復，幾乎刻不容緩。本年三月間，二中全會在渝開會，乃决定修改現行財政收支系統，以期中央與地方財政平均發展，並擬就原則，交政府切實施行。財糧兩部鑒於三十五年財政年度轉瞬將屆，乃召集此次會議，討論實施辦法。</p>
<p>關於省級財政，自去年八月各省次第開始辦理接收復員工作以來，即遭遇重大困難。一方面，省府需要經費，爲數甚鉅，而中央補助費旣屬有限，且不能按時發放；另一方面，省府爲法令所限，毫無籌劃經費之餘地。於是各省財政支絀，庶政無法推動，理財無辦法，一切均成空談，亦即所謂「巧婦不能爲無米之炊」。今番改革財政收支系統，恢復從前的三級制，並規定田賦徵實，以百分之三十歸中央，百分之二十歸省方，百分之五十歸地方。財政專家估計，如此分配，省級財政仍感無法維持，各省代表亦歷訴困難情形。尤其是貧苦省份實行新制，收支依然難望平衡，不得不設法補救，因此又决定三項辦法：（一）由各省市編具收支對照表，報請中央核撥補助費；（二）職員待遇經費，應在實物售價溢收項下統籌；（三）各邊遠省份及未恢復區域，所需事業費，應請中央特予補助撥借。這樣，省級財政或可解决一部份，但是在中央財政也萬分支絀的情形之下，省級財政仍不能認爲已有辦法。</p>
<p>說到田賦微實辦法，自民國三十年七月份實行以來，已經整整的五個年頭，其間雖難免弊　，但究不失爲我國糧政史上的重大成就，不僅解决了我國抗戰期間的最嚴重的軍糧問題，而且政府以糧控價，也收到穩定物價至少穩定公敎人員生活的相當功效。但在實際上，因爲施行辦法很難週密，徵收者易於上下其手，而運輸儲藏，手續繁重，公家收入有限，人民負担不輕。加以稻穀乾潮，在重量上大有出入，稻中容易摻和雜物，在質量上也有極大的等差，稻穀不可久藏，腐爛耗損，漫無標準，幾經轉手，常常有變質和缺量的事情發生。而一般徵收人員，往往偷天換日，把國家的公糧，一轉移間漸入私囊。這種現象在各省各縣，幾乎多少難免。某些糧官的自殺，或亦吃了過去糧帳不實之虧。戰時徵實出於不得已，現已自戰時至平時，論理原可取消徵實，但是政府仍決定延長徵實辦法一年，此必有其極大的苦衷。誠如　蔣主席所說：「此次會議決定田賦徵實延長一年，此舉對於完成復員工作，實爲必要。但地方糧食當局在徵實時，要特別體念人民之痛苦，减少徵收手續，嚴禁苛擾，以期便利人民。」希望與會的各位地方長官，回去之後，實施徵實，都能把　蔣主席這一段訓話，再三誥誡僚屬，要時時存着不得已而爲之的一片婆心，千萬不可再把徵實看作營私自肥的方便之門。</p>
<p>中國人民百分之八十爲農民，在此次抗戰期中，以廣大的人力與軍糧，支持國家抗戰，貢獻之多，史無前例。但在勝利之後的今日，放眼看看全國農村，在災區的不必說，即在最富庶的蘇浙皖贛，農村也已到了崩潰的邊緣。這時正是與民休息的時候了！國家大員，眞應該負起責任，不避嫌怨，整肅政風，再不可讓貪官汚吏，假借徵實的名義，在農村橫徵暴歛，引起平民的怨聲載道！糧政當局尤應懲前毖後，防患未然，杜絕一切流弊，庶幾不負中樞决策延長微實一年的苦心。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕本市糧食，自當局嚴禁投機以來，價格即趨下跌。然前昨又發現黑市交易，市塲稍起波動，故吳市長特於昨晨十時半，親赴靑運閣米市塲訓話，略謂：「希望各米店能各守本位，為民食着想，若米店無米應市時，可到米行業公會登記，設法供售，使本市糧食得到合理解決。」歷時約二十分鍾離去。又社會局嚴禁暗盤交易，並不許掮客入塲。所有各行號，最近一個月來之平均成交數字，當局調查至為詳盡，除供應市塲所需外，不准多賣，藉防囤積，門市成交之食米，行號須　　發票，交與顧客，如有不給發表情事，市民　可檢舉。</p>
<p>（上）吳市長在米市塲對米商訓話（下）米市塲上羣眾（俞創　攝）</p>
<p>市府對於糧食來源暢通，極為重視，曾電糧食部及江蘇省政府請取締產米區抬價，並對滬市米商到產區採購糧食，予以便利。至本市存米現已登記者，達五十萬担，每日市塲需要約七千六百担，就存米之總數而言，足敷二月之需，來自國內產區之食米，每日到達約有四千至一萬担，且洋米即可源源運到，食米來源，絕無恐慌之虞。</p>

<p>〔又訊〕近日之米市交易，因米行之不肯吐貨，米號無處批售，市塲上甚少交易，有者多以次貨應市，另以黑市暗盤，高價來往。記者昨晨特往靑運閣米市塲作一巡禮，適吳市長亦往該處巡視訓話。</p>
<p>昨日市塲上交易仍稀，有貨者尚取觀望態度，應市者仍多次貨。記者目睹一處喊價四萬六千四之秈米三百石，一哄而光。好貨仍有在塲外秘密交易者。</p>
<p>吳市長蒞臨訓話後，一般反響甚佳，彼此議論紛紛，稱明日脫手者必多。一米號主發牢騷曰：做米業至今，從未有至今日之絕者。米號無處購米。如以大價吃進，則不堪虧累。我人旣已渡過抗戰期間之八年，何以不能渡過將臨之二月。待新穀登塲後，形勢即可好轉，目前一任投機者之自蹈法網，勿為迷惑云。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕偽江蘇省警察局長張松濤，昨日下午在高院再度審理，據其供稱：彼之財產，在揚子飯店者僅五千股，每股一百元，其在偽局長任內，曾於廿八年間營救地下工作人員許崇智，楊惠。廿九年間，曾被偽特工捕去，由陳羣·任援道保出，但不准其離滬，而陳羣與彼之關係，乃為朋友，彼之出任偽局長，即受陳之引援，而由偽江蘇省政府警務處委任，為　任偽官。在職期內，僅辦理竊盜案件，維持治安，至於有關政治者，歸「政治保衛局」辦理，一切煙館，由戒煙局管轄，與彼無關云云。該案將於本月二十日下午二時半宣判。同日並將宣判偽調查統計部第三　科員馬遂良案。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕去年春末，正當美國海軍逼近日本本土，旭「日」行將暮沉的時候，在京滬一帶，曾出現過一種風行陷區的刊物，它的名字，就是「大公」。呼籲日軍撤兵，正投一般近視的人民所好，可是「大公」畢竟是偽方的宣傳刊物，所以它的主辦者章克（偽宣傳部次長）也終於被捕入獄，受國法制裁。</p>
<p>章為杭州人，現年四十三歲，畢業於燕京大學政經系，曾留學德國柏林大學，且得美國哥倫比亞大學政經，市政系碩士學位，回國後任外長陳友仁之私人秘書，並隨陳赴莫斯科，柏林等地，後又任燕京中山等校教授十餘年，戰後隨政府西撤，曾任靑年幹部訓練團政治教官，旋應陳之約，赴香港為其私人服務，並在財部稅務專校執教，迨太平洋大戰爆發，香港淪陷，章與陳同被俘，來滬後，陳於卅一年夏病逝，章乃赴南京受偽宣傳部長林柏生之請任該部次長。嗣因建議召開陷區民眾代表會議未果，遂於同年十一月辭職，與敵「大使」谷正之「書記」淸水密約二項原則：（一）以民主統一救國為號召，接近其他黨派，以分散抗戰力量，以實行敵方分化政策。（二）得刊載要求日本撤退在華駐兵，以便敵人抽調一部份精銳部隊回國，防衛本土等。於三十四年四月間在滬刊行「大公周刊」，主張前項建議，並促成「中日和平」，反對盟軍在中國作戰，共刊行十三期，於卅四年七月，因故停刊。勝利後，由軍統局逮捕，移送高檢處偵查，依法提起公訴。</p>
<p>昨晨邱推事開審，被告延洪士豪律師為辯護人，章衣灰色西服，著黃色皮鞋，頭发整齊，頗有「學者丰度」。據供，被俘後，押解來滬，一本國民立塲，對任何利誘脅迫，均予拒絕，至民國卅三年六月，與偽宣傳部長林柏生，因同學關係，時有過從，頻以東南之局勢為慮，乃主張取消偽府，還政於中央，另組委員會以救濟淪陷區民眾。此議會為陳公博，林柏生所贊同，且當時有靑年黨之曾琦在座，稱將此建議，以參政員資格帶赴重慶商榷。而林逆逐邀章加入偽府，共同貫澈主張，始應允之。惟到任後，林逆對約定各點，無所作為，而被告亦孤掌難鳴，因決定辭職，並利用偽職之便利，取得登記證，發行大公週刊，以貫澈在偽職任內所無法貫澈之還政於中央，乃救濟民眾等主張。在「位」五月，對宣揚偽政府及推行和運二者，始終未身與其事，實無通謀敵國，圖謀反抗本國之行為。被告固應受國法之制裁，但望從輕量刑云。至於發行大公周刊事，辯稱「無不以大無畏精神，掩護中樞，指摘敵偽罪行，並宣揚盟國戰績，提出民氣及抗戰勝利之信念，以言論效忠補過，可見被告之心」云云。經邱推事詳訊一過，即論改期再訊。</p>
<h3 id="c70">玻璃時代玻璃狂　玻璃褲帶玻璃鞋　玻璃櫃內　包羅萬象 <a href="#c70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>有人把目前的上海，看作「玻璃時代」。玻璃褲帶幾乎每人都有一條，玻璃皮鞋也慢慢的在出風頭了。你如要廉價的玻璃褲帶，可到馬路邊的攤頭去買。這種攤頭現在替馬路增加了不少的活氣，最多的集中地帶是勞合路及新世界西藏路一帶。他們的小櫃內包羅萬象，吃的用的都有，有的即使是國貨，也加上美國貨的銜頭，因此「美國迷」都趨之若鶩。</p>
<p>最近他們小小的圈子內，曾經有過一番騷擾。美軍的MP和SP不止一次地把幾個攤頭的貨物沒收，前幾天晚報上甚至說起美國憲兵有把攤販逮捕進去的。據記者所知，這種攤頭，名為出賣美軍用品，其實軍用品只佔十分之二三，他們雖出售馬立司香煙和玻璃褲帶，但都是完過稅的。甚至他們也出售國貨，如茂昌太陽眼鏡，奶粉，印條府綢等。而印條府綢，也大都係從姊妹花賓大祥等布店批發而來，並有發票為證。攤販們常因貨品被沒收來報館訴苦。據說SP中往往有不問皂白，戴上茂昌眼鏡，藏起罐頭香煙而走的。攤販們因為事起倉猝，慌張之中，來不及辨明SP巡邏車的號碼。他們到憲兵總部去，也不能查明，因此這里起了一個問題：軍用品旣已沒收，合法的商品到何處去請求發還？上海一地，　這種攤頭的小販約有一萬人。他們大都是出高利貸借來本錢設攤的。較大的資本約在百萬上下，最小的也在二三十萬之間，因此一旦貨物被沒收充公，損失非常浩大。他們認為受冤屈的主要理由是被沒收的貨品中，事實上軍用品佔數極少，大部分是國貨或已完過稅的美國貨；而且每逢他們到美軍憲兵總部去問詢時，沒有人能給他們一個負責的答覆。至於他們全部貨物之中極小部分的軍用品，也是由中央市塲黃牛黨批發而來，並非直接收的賊贓。此外，市面上流通的美國貨，也有美國軍人個人賣出來的，不過他們不要中國法幣。統計目前美國兵在上海的全部消耗每月約在一二百萬美金之間，他們用貨品再把美金票收回去，這在我國外滙方面的損失是非常大的。而美軍個人的以出售貨物來收回美金，這舉動未始不經過他們上級的默許。</p>
<p>關於美軍憲兵是否可在上海直接沒收中國攤販的貨品，甚至是否可直接逮捕中國攤販，似乎是一個疑問。記者為此，特於前日下午走訪外交部駐滬辦事處，據該處表示，他們尚不知有此等事情發生，並認為美憲兵如確有逮捕我國攤販等情，內幕當不如我們所想之簡單。不過如果美憲兵舉動真的不合法，並有抵觸我國主權之處，政府方面當然是要依法提出抗議的。（鼎　）</p>

<p>本市以往財政收支，不敷甚巨，經行政院貼補一部分後，尚可彌補。惟自七月份起，政院規定不再撥貼，悉由地方自籌，即取之營業，土地，契稅等項以增收人。惟目前對營業稅徴收數額是否足以補助尚不得而知，而自六月份起，政院通過公教人員調整待遇後，支出不敷，勢將更鉅。中央僅允擔任國家部分，按月補助五億元。谷氏表示急救辦法，僅能急其所急，而緩其所緩，儘量減少不必要之支出。此外對於管理稅收，亦當嚴密執行，以防漏稅。並望市民共同合作，儘量舉發報告，查實後決嚴厲處罰。目前決不提高任何稅收，以免增加人民負擔，至調整房捐，暫時尚不易實行，惟正擬訂方案中，</p>
<p>關於發行公債事，谷局長認為購買力尚無把握，不擬舉辦。前工部局所發行公債，因局中事務繁忙，猶未淸理完畢。</p>

<h3 id="c94">小學課程研究座　小學課程標準的合理途徑 <a href="#c94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>修訂小學課程，已成為各方面注意的集中點。小學教育是教育的出發點，也是每一個未來國民智識的基礎；有了健全的小學教育和智識基礎，才能接受高深的學問，造成一個優秀的國民。</p>
<p>過去一般人都忽略小學教育，把神聖重要的小學教育，認為無足輕重，現在這個錯誤的觀念已漸次糾正，大家承認了小學教育的重要性，它是每個國民的知識搖籃，和灌輸兒童基本教育的褓姆。</p>
<p>吾國的教育，一向沒有合理的標準，而尤以小學為甚。各學校自訂課程，五花八門，深淺不一，同一年級的學生，因所讀學校不同，程度就有了高低，這樣下去，中學大學，學生們的學力，就始終不能相等，也尋不出一個確切的標準來。所以修訂小學課程標準，實是刻不容緩的事情。</p>
<p>但什麽是小學課程的標準呢？關係太大了，應該經過各方面的慎重研究後才能決定。這研究的方向，相當廣泛，筆者認為須綜合兒童的體力，智力，心理，經騐，和在小學六年中實際所需要得到的知識，加以詳細的分析和觀察後，才可以具體決定，付之實施。</p>
<p>現在一般兒童的入學年齡，都較過去提早，平均大概在六歲左右，最早的，中國年齡五歲就入學了，年齡旣穉，就如一瓣方纔從椏枝上透出來的嫩苗，智力當然十分薄弱，這時的課程，就只得儘量的簡化。筆者認為小學一二年級，教育兒童的責任，祇需做到如下幾點：（一）啓發兒童的思想，由散漫而趨集中。（二）引起兒童的求知慾和對課程的興趣。（三）使兒童知道最幼穉的常識，計數，禮貌。</p>
<p>等兒童的思想集中了，基礎穩固了，對所受的教育漸漸地發生了興趣，然後按步就班，從三年級起，將科目合理地增多，加深，但是這增多和加深，務須適合兒童的體力和智力，使他（她）們能接受，也能消化，不致引起營養不良和疳積等惡劣反應。</p>
<p>筆者並非出身於教育系，更非研究教育問題的專家，不過感到了這問題的嚴重性，和過去因不合理課程所引起的惡果，想到正有千千萬萬未來的小國民，呻吟在這個不合理的課程的鞭韃下，亟待解救。自己也是國民的一份子，我的孩子長大起來，也要送到學校裏去受教育，我不能眼看着這個課程標準永遠不合理下去，而不加以改革，特就管見所及，撰述本文，以供負責修訂小學課程標準者的參考。（高武弘，卅五，六，十一，於無錫）</p>

<p>吳市長親赴市場訓話　成交價須以上日爲準</p>
<p>吳市長昨晨親赴米業市塲，向米商作主要訓話，略謂：（一）對企圍投機囤積米商，決加以取締，市塲成交價，以上一日之行情爲標準，不准抬高，現本市多日約需米七千餘担，如到貨不數，准由已登記之米補充之，（二）各門市米號，准依照其實銷食米數量，向市塲批購，惟不准多購，以免囤積，又價格方面，照向市塲批購價格加百分之六利潤及車費，此外不准多加，出售時必須有發票。</p>
<p>米市塲昨日做開見增，一般正當米商，多能體仰當局意旨，依常交易，但黑心投機奸商，仍在暗中活躍，故客貨向市塲登記說减，昨日各檔貨原盤未更，惟百元較跌五百元，昨日客貨登記僅及二八七七石，內白粳九〇三石，薄稻五六四石，羊秈三四〇石，杜秈七一石，蕪秈九九九石，麵粉早漲午跌，結果收盤反成疲勢，苞米依然少神，紅糧市面不振，新麥甬帮動而不旺，形居挺站，陳麥去化平平，價格平正，黃豆亦少軒輊，生仁胃呆，回小一二千元，蠶豆來源湧旺，步跌千餘元，豆餅消路不暢，供多於求，回疲一二百元，麩皮加一二百元，油價升數百元至千元。</p>

<p>公債逢低突有大量補空，北帮力購。川帮銀行亦稍活動，統丙晨開四三〇〇元，開後再退至四一五〇元，遂遭買戶拉上，盤旋而升，最後竟以五千元高價結束，結果較前收漲起六五〇元，甲乙帶好五五〇元，丁戊急漲七百元。</p>

<p>— 特派員韓清濤</p>
<p>本報長春三日航電</p>
<p>國軍進入長者，已經十多天了。十多天的工夫，長春逐步走上了正常狀態，初更的熱風，這時也開始在這裏吹拂，熨貼，戰事息止，季節更移，愁苦的人們，得到了很大的慰藉。</p>
<p>警備司令廖耀湘將軍，副司令舒適存將軍在廿八日那天，正式就了職，代長春市長尙傳道率領秘書長劉守剛等，也在廿九日趕到視事，其他機關相縱成立，也有的在籌備中。</p>
<p>秩序逐步的恢復，到了本月初，已經大見安定了，一批批的市民在打掃街道，在淸除碎磚亂瓦，以及其他一些障碍物，面孔上流露着欣悅，忙着進行初步的復興工作。</p>
<p>電燈，在共軍退出後就沒光了，大家不得不過黑暗生活，所幸經過了兩天短暫的時間，又從新大放光明，電台也開始播音，日夜在廣播新聞，平劇，流行歌曲。</p>
<p>商店在初僅有小雜貨舖應市，後來大商店一家跟着一家開門了，同時每家忙着將疏散埋藏起來的貨品，起出，搬進，從新佈置起來，幷且紛紛製作霓虹燈，商店的顧客多半是軍人，飯館裏也大都是軍人在吃喝，大家認爲辛苦多時的軍人，也應該有些享受了。</p>
<p>市面上的車馬，一天一天的多起來，電車也在行駛，人民好像做了一塲惡夢般的甦醒過來，開始在街頭活躍，街頭巷尾滿貼着「歡迎國軍」和「蔣主席萬歲」的標語，看起來，長春市容，已經熱鬧起來。</p>
<p>物價，在目前比較瀋陽低廉多多，尤以吃食最顯著，大米一斤廿二元，高粱一斤七元，猪肉一斤廿五元，—每東北流通券一元合國幣十三元，蔬菜等也都便宜，一般雜貨，也低於瀋陽，如無人操縱和囤積，再加上交通不發生問題，那可以維持一個低廉時期的。</p>
<p>長春的日本人，在共軍佔據長春的時候，沒受到什麽損害，現在有回國的希望了，所以從前的「吉野町」和「大和通」一帶，售賣衣服什物的更多起來，狹隘的街道上，擠滿了買賣貨的人們，嘈雜熱鬧的情形，正好像瀋陽的「春日町」和「靑葉町」，最大的百貨商店「白龍」，是原先「三中井」的轉變，仍然操在日人手中，最好的住宅，也仍舊是日人住着，當局對於這已經在擬訂整頓和取締的計劃。</p>

<p>東北光復後，長春從僞名「新京」恢復了原名，中央所派人員和盟友蘇軍，以及長春的人民，共同相處八個月多，中間雖有幾度波瀾和不安，但終於在友好空氣裏過去了。</p>
<p>在四月初旬，長春蘇軍開始撤退，至十二日正午，撤退完了。從蘇軍撤退開始，市內空氣由逐漸緊迫。鬧到大感恐慌，原因是共軍源源而來。</p>
<p>長春北面，萬寳山，布海站，一間堡一帶，火車載來了共軍，東面則有共軍從吉林開到了岔路河，飲馬河，拉拉屯一帶，南方則從伊通方面開到何家屯，葦子溝，西部到達白城子，於是形成了包圍陣勢。</p>
<p>四月十二日夜八時，共軍開始進攻，圍城戰開始，硝烟彈雨，瀰漫了整個長春，消息傳遍中外，到了十八日，政府孤軍，外援不至，彈藥斷絕，死傷，撤退，中止了抵抗，長春於是進人了共軍手中。</p>
<p>飛機塲，僞國務院，新皇宮，交通部，民生部，東大橋，南大街，大馬路，西安橋，博物館，電報局，大興公司，康德會館，都做了爭奪據點和戰塲，建築物破壞，公私生命財產，受到了空前的損害。</p>

<p>編輯先生：報載「吳市長對記者談：分配房屋原則，根據</p>
<p>蔣主席於京手訂五人以上限住二間，六人以上可住三間，最多不得超過四間，解除房屋之原則云云」，鄙人閱後，深爲欽佩。惟原則語意含蓄，致近日謠言百出。茲有疑問四點：（一）原則，六人以上不得超過四間，是否限一戶爲言，或是十二人以上可住八間，以此類推？（二）上海平民住宅，現在五人能得居住三間者極少。出頂金條，業經嚴禁，以此係雙方情願之事，何人吿發？所禁，列爲具文。然因此無屋者，尙有屋可住，而有除屋者，早已出頂，自願擠居，似不必以間數人數爲限。（三）原則固是對官民一體而言，究竟達官貴人，上級官員住宅，是否一律遵辦？（四）所載此後行政院機關房屋分配，當本此原則，是否係就此次接收各種房屋分配各機關而言，與平民租屋及自建住宅無干？凡事以身作則，推已及人，謂之恕，法律平等，應爲上下所遵守。如果政府除辦公機關及　主席私邸例外，凡特任官餘屋可分與同等官及簡任官居住，自上至下，以此類推，至於平民，自無房荒之慮。即以上海而論，此次接收日方官商房屋，以及日僑德僑並偽方住宅，何只數千間？現在究爲何人所住？有無分配？假使市長以身作則，嚴令屬下，所有餘屋一律分租，惟要人等之住宅能否辦到？讀者張福民上。六月七。</p>
<h3 id="c127">可憐的常熟小學教師！ <a href="#c127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>編輯先生：除文化中心地的上海以外，我們常熟在戰前素稱爲全江蘇省敎育最普及，文化最發達的一縣。他的所以能文化發達，教育普及，生活的安定和環境的優秀，當然是一部分的重要原因。但是最不可忽視的一點，就是常熟縣的中小學敎師們，大都是由本地熱心地方敎育事業者担任的，由於本地敎師辦本地敎育之熱心和努力，學生的學業當然突飛猛晋無疑了。</p>
<p>但是試觀今日之下常熟縣敎育文化的程度怎樣呢？却和它古老的城牆一般，落人之後了。就是以學生的學業和他埠的學生相較，他們的成績是否能够保持平衡，確是一個疑問。我們相信，敎師敎學的熱心與否，對於學生的學業確實有直接的重大的關係的。敎員一天到晚愁米愁柴，肚裏空城計一天唱到晚，所教育的兒童的學業，可以不言而論了。</p>
<p>現在到處正在發動尊師運動，像怒潮一般的澎湃着，籃球義賽啦，廣播演說啦，我們眞覺得　羨。因爲眼看着別的地方的敎員可以有了相當的辦法。但是試觀我們常熟縣的敎員們呢，仍舊束緊了褲帶，挨着餓堅守着本位工作着。尊師運動之類，由那個來發起呢？又向那個去捐募呢？雖然縣敎育科曾不負責任的着各校向學生捐募，但是這是不是普及敎育的好辦法呢？是不是解決敎員飢餓的基本方法呢？是不是我們辦本地敎育事業的敎員們所樂做的呢？我們寗願餓死，也不向學生們開口捐一個錢！</p>
<p>前次見到報上披露省政府的命令，以物價指數屢有變遷，着縣政府將公敎月薪按月發放不得任意拖欠等情。初見時不覺得雀躍數千，但是那裏知道我們此次領到的薪水，還是「四月份預支的半月薪」呢！時序已届五月底六月初了，還「預支」四月分的薪，那個「預」字不知作何解釋？就是叫我們拿了這區區萬數千元的薪，能够去養家活小了嗎？</p>
<p>這種種情形所造成的惡果，便是地方上有資格的教員，紛紛往他處就敎，或另謀生計，所賸下的一般敎員，或爲敷衍性質，或爲無能力無資格者，暫作懷止。但是試問以這一般敎員來敎育我們的下一代，它的影響是如何的可怕啊！</p>
<p>我們不忍目覩我們常熟縣敎育事業趨於崩潰之途，所以我們大聲的來向各方面社會的熱心人士們疾呼：救救我們在惡劣環境下和飢餓綫上掙扎的常熟縣小敎們，救救行將沒落的常熟縣敎育事業！一羣常邑小敎員繆慰民，朱葆書，黃汝楠，季縵雲等敬上。</p>

<p>長春市政府的樓房，已經燒燬了，市長趙君邁被共軍帶走了，新代市長尙傳道，在前「冲電氣株式會社」暫做新府址，這所寬大的樓房，沒有門窗，沒有桌椅板凳，新市長和他的部屬，正在這殘缺軀殼裏，開展他們的工作</p>
<p>過去東北行營所在地的「滿炭」大樓，已被一燒而光，現在僅有殘餘軀殼支撑着殘局，中央銀行也毀於砲火，號稱束亞第一的金庫，已經破壞，據云共軍爲了破壞這座金庫，曾經煞費苦心，最後徵集日本技術人員，使用瓦斯火力在金庫上鑽成小孔，埋上炸藥，才把這座金庫炸毀了，市政府，警察局前關東軍司令部，僞皇宮，都變成了一片瓦礫。</p>
<p>市內最寬廣的馬路舊大同街一帶，到處留有傷心慘目的遺跡，車站內外，景象更慘然，列車躺在路軌上，從前車馬行人熙來攘往情形，今日已不復存在了。</p>
<p>有力量的新聞工作人員，都賽跑般爭先恐後的趕到了長春，又角力般的佔用了房屋機器，競爭的情形，成了白熱化狀態，在新聞工作精神上，實在是大有可取處，同時也盡到了最火的努力，在另一觀點上，有人說逍是不合理的現象，原因在於沒有實行統籌及整個的分配計劃。</p>
<p>最先出版的是「前進日報」，它在國軍進入長春不到一個星期的時間就接收了僞「康德新聞」出報了，時間是五月廿八日，接着出版的是「新生命報、」「大華日報」「長春日報」「靑年日報」「東北民報」等六家，在預備發刋中的尙有五六家之多，其中有些是：「丟下了槍桿來要筆桿」。</p>
<p>長春，在僞滿時代，僅有「康德新聞」和「滿鮮日報」兩家，現在急遽的發展起來，一切器材，設備，自然有多少不匀和缺乏現象，先到後到以及有力無力，到今天表現得最充份最明顯大家爭辦報紙的空氣在這裏顯得很緊張呢！</p>
<p>國軍進駐長春了，接收人員，行政官吏，技術人員，正絡繹於瀋陽到長春道上，長春八十萬民衆，也正期待協助這些已到和未到的人員工作，同時也希望不再有其他各地接收的紊亂現象，雖然現在已經有些地方，不大合乎規定了，但是願至此而止，務使長春早日邁上復興建設的路途！</p>
<h3 id="c129">東方蒙地卡羅　澳門近情 <a href="#c129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>本報香港一日航訊　特約記者　林友蘭</p>
<p>路透社五月廿二日忽從葡京里斯本拍發一個消息，說據可靠方面稱：美國現正與葡方談判在珠江口外的葡屬澳門設立一個航空基地。早在五月八日，澳門的華僑報已載稱：「美國汎美航空公司，爲溝通遠東航空綫起見，戰前曾在澳設分公司，幷在附近海面設飛機降落塲。太平洋戰起，即吿停頓。</p>
<p>彈丸之地　將變成航空站</p>
<p>戰事結束後，汎美公司積極復員，已次第恢復星洲，馬尼拉等空站，澳門方面，亦在計劃中。最近舊事重提，派員來澳辦理一切。在澳建築機塲一事，將可宣佈實現。」澳門這塊彈丸小地，也許行將變爲世界航空站之一。記者趁此機會，略述澳門近事，希望國人不致完全忽略了這個在珠江三角洲最南端的小半島。</p>
<p>不久以前，澳門的賭業大王傅德蔭，（又名傅老容，）給匪徒在寺院裏綁架，勒贖黃金一百斤。這個新聞，傳遍了粵港各地。傅老容和高可寗合辦的泰興總公司，承包了全澳的賭館和娛樂事業，（包括酒店，餐室，舞塲，）他不啻是這個「東方蒙地卡羅」的「沙皇」。澳門在今日全世界一致禁烟禁賭聲中，是烟飯賭館竟可公開營業，當地的政費，也出自烟稅和賭餉收入的一個城市一個製造罪惡破壞文明的中心。</p>
<p>戰前港人　週末赴澳賭注</p>
<p>從香港到澳門去，僅有四小時的水程，戰前澳門是香港人渡週末最理想的去處。在香港，每天上午八時下午二時，有船開往澳門。由澳門返港，除上下午兩班外，還有一班半夜船，夜深二時開行，凌晨抵達，眞合一般尋歡買醉者的口味。假如你在賭塲下過相當數目的賭注，牠們便替你準備好返港的頭等船票，使你就是千金散盡，也沒有流落異鄉，望洋興嘆之苦。現在香港或廣州的人們，都給生活迫得要命，可剩多少還有閒情逸致到澳門去揮霍呢！</p>
<p>人去樓空　桃源文化爲荒島</p>
<p>澳門遭遇了嚴重的不景氣。尤其加深澳門的不景氣的，是戰時的難民大批的復員，現留澳人口，尙達十餘萬。戰時，澳門和里斯本一樣，掛起中立的招牌，僥倖逃避了砲火的洗禮。當日港粵人士紛紛避難，澳門頓成了一個世外桃源。但好景不常，現已人去樓空，市容冷落，要不是香港人滿爲患，廣州　饉與時疫同來</p>
<p>澳門可說沒有商業，而絕無僅有的工業，也逃不脫他的厄運。士敏土廠因原料缺乏，早已停工。火柴和香港，曾一度暢銷粵港一帶。但最近美國火柴和香煙大批湧到，市價幷不比澳門貨貴。澳門貨漸歸淘汰了。大西洋銀行所發行的澳鈔，價值和港鈔相近，起落相差不過百分之二。澳鈔和港鈔無形聯系起來。港澳間政治的微妙關係也就反映於這個經濟接近性之上。</p>
<p>壓抑國幣　旅客無辜受累</p>
<p>澳門政府仰仗他的「太上主人」的餘威，向來對我國軍民擺出猙獰可惡的面目。戰前，澳門當局明令不准我軍履足澳門，在華葡交界的關閘，屯有一小隊臉黑如炭從葡屬東非土著軍隊，橫加拘捕穿軍服過境的我國人民，甚至有個時期，連穿中山服的公務員和學生也這他們的凌辱。在學校裏又强迫我學生習葡文。葡當局低首貼耳於日人勢力下對當地居民所作種種無理的迫害，尤爲一般所難忘，一九四三年所施行郵電和新聞檢査的非常措施，至今仍未廢除。最近又頒佈旅客不得携帶五萬元以上國幣入口的限制，往來旅客無辜受累者，不知凡幾。經當地商會向澳督戴思樂多方請求，才把限額增至五十萬元，這顯然是壓抑國幣而維護毫無準備金的澳幣的一種措施—即在英人直接統治下的香港，也沒有那麽苛待！</p>
<p>葡人侵權　我國應提聲明</p>
<p>澳門於一五五七年（明嘉靖年間）由我政府租與葡人作爲遠東掛帆之所，開外人在國境內設立租借地之濫觴。當日曾訂明由葡人年納地租五百兩，而地域僅以關前街，三巴門爲界，（見夷務始末二十七卷），約章所在，中國得在澳門設官和徵收關稅，復聲明不得轉讓他人。乃久而久之，租金旣不納，且乘我國內多事之秋，逐漸擴大其界限，沿荷蘭園，望厦，以至關閘，都是葡人在約章以外所侵佔的土地。有一時期，葡人貪慾難償，更越入澳門對岸的灣仔，良坑，（中山縣屬），欲佔爲已有。現在汎美公司打算建立航空基地的路環，面對我屬橫琴島，是否葡屬，尙待査明。萄政府乃不顧一切，在里斯本與美方談判，蔑視我國主權。關於這點，我外交當局似有向美方提出正式聲明的必要。</p>
<p>限期交還　實爲名正言順</p>
<p>我們要收回失地，也一樣要收回澳門，除去版圖上的汚點。去年日本投降後，陪都的輿論界力主我當局先行收回澳門，良以中葡邦交平日甚少往還，而葡人在遠東又無權益關係。在我勵精圖治銳意刷新的今日，若葡人爲尊重我國主權，本不待我們開口，便須把澳門交還才是。詎知葡人仍眷戀昔日迷夢，狐假虎威，變本加厲，置我方善意或友妤於不顧。政府現雖有比收回澳門更不知重要多少倍的任務正待完成，但對這六方哩蕞爾之地，限期交還，名正言順，亦屬易舉，香港方面，英國有識之士，旣揭即日交還以敦中英友好於前，而深明大局的倫敦官方，亦揭示改革政制予以自治權力於後，乃葡萄牙是什麽國家，在他人一片凈土之上，大開烟賭，破壞文明，違反國際公法，不特沒有半點悔禍的表示，反夜郞自大，聲勢汹汹，喧賓奪主。我們酷愛和平，講求友道，但對宵小醜類，實在不宜過於姑息，因爲流弊所及，徒令陰謀家肆無忌憚，得寸進尺而已</p>
<p>澳門位於珠江口，和廣州香港鼎足時立。東距香港四十哩，北距廣州一百哩，屬中山縣境，離國父故鄉翠亨村約三十哩。有寬闊河道通達江門和三埠，對西江上游的交通，比廣州允爲便利。沿海岸西行至戰後收回的廣州灣（現改名湛江市），兩地商人，頗有來往。</p>

<p>本報二日倫敦航電　特約記者雪岩</p>
<p>英國在一切復員聲中，生育也在復員。出征的兵士歸來，家庭重聚，因此嬰兒的生育增加，本屬意料中事。但問題是今年春季人口的生產登記，指明較預期的生育增加，還多出一萬七千人來，依此形勢推測夏季更要多出四萬人來，這種意外的增加，遂成爲嚴重問題。首先是助產婦感覺不足，其次產科醫院的設備，亦不足應付需要。衛生大臣　文，已向各地方當局呼籲，竭力協助產婦。助產婦及產科醫院看　待遇的提高，不用說了，凡是外圃助產婦，願來工作的，盡量予以方便，已改業的助產婦，則竭力助其復員。此外，紅十宇會的看護，現在已有一部分調到產科醫院去了。經過衛生部的這樣努力後，夏季的問題，可望需決。</p>
<p>英國購買物品時，祇要有三個人同時在買，就要排隊了。作戰以米，因爲店員愈減少，隊伍愈長了。這一年來、戰事已止，排隊的情形，是否有改善，這是一般人希望知道的。擬五月中在英格蘭，蘇格蘭及威爾斯各地作民意調査，其問題爲：「據你個人感覺，目前爲了購買任何東西而費于排隊上的時間，是否較一年前多或少？」。答案中百分之三十一稱多，百分之三十六稱相同，百分之十九稱少，百分之十四稱不知。但英國的情形，一般上街買物品，大多是婦女，所以婦女的答案，也許比較更準確。同樣問題，據純粹婦女的答案，爲百分之三十八稱多，百分之三十五稱同，百分之二十稱少，百分之七稱不知。由此觀之，需要排隊的時間，似乎更長了。至少，答稱需要較少時間的，是佔少數</p>
<h3 id="c131">波蘭軍人復員問題　是英國新負担 <a href="#c131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>在這次戰爭中，波蘭人民，在伦敦波兰流氓政府领导下，参加对德義作戰的軍人約五十萬。這些人不管政治見解怎樣，都曾効勞過于盟國。因爲波蘭的流亡政府設在英國，主要受英國支持，所以這些人的功績，英國也最能賞識。但雅爾泰會議的結果，倫敦的彼蘭政府，必需與在波蘭境內的人民政府合流，也即是流亡中的波蘭政府，失去其存在的根據，因此聯帶到其所領導的五十萬軍人，也有無所率從之苦。在戰爭期間，反正編在英美軍中，効一分勞吃一分糧，問題還不嚴重。現在，戰事早結束了，軍人都忙于解甲歸業，這批波蘭軍人歸到那裏去，便成爲一個嚴重問題。按理，他們自然可以回到波蘭去，但我們知道現在的波蘭政府，是與蘇聯爲一型，他們這些受英美訓練出來的軍人，自覺格格不相入，大多表示不顧回去。加以今年二月，波蘭政府宣布，這些軍隊如願歸國，不須解散隊伍，個別回去，方能得到安插，他們更是惴惴不安。幸有英國政府極力撑腰，在聯合國大會中討論到救濟難民時，英國堅主凡因政見不同而不願歸國的人，也應視爲難民救濟。蘇聯波蘭極力辦斥，雙方心目中，顯然都意識到波蘭的解甲軍人問題。據估計，現在這五十萬人，大部都在德國境內，約佔全數的五分之三，其次是義大利境內，亦十餘萬，英國境內約四五萬。現在義大利境內的波軍，已開始解散，其中願意依照現在波蘭政府所開的條件，個別回到波蘭去重立生計的僅三千人，其餘十一萬餘人，即將運至英國，成爲英國政府的一種新負担。英國政府已允諾他們，極力爲他們設法安插，助他們重立生計。例如與各自治領及南美各國等尙有餘地可以安插移民的國家交涉，要求他們容納一部分。其餘亦爲其在英國本國及歐洲大陸找尋職業，聽說警戒俘虜營及開鑛的礦工，都還需要人，大概必可以安插一部分。在未找到適當職業前，這些波蘭的解甲軍人，暫時仍駐在軍營中候命，薪給照領，但戰時津貼則取消了。不過將來問題最大的，還是德國境內的波人，數目太大，找出路怕比較困難了。</p>

<p>— 少夫</p>
<p>昨天和平日報副刋「海天」上，有一則燈虎揭曉，它的謎面是「老處女心情」，謎底「射名記者一人」，以「下少夫」作答而首中者有陳國增李靑來二先生。</p>
<p>我不敢說朋友開我的玩笑，但有點過分抬舉我，因爲鄙人「記者」雖已十有三年，「名」却未必。前輩同業甚多，何敢僭妄。</p>
<p>然而「老處女心情」這個謎面，頗令我幻生無限遐想。</p>
<p>美人遲暮，日子的確不好過。想嫁人，嫁給誰呢？年靑的不見得看中自己，年老的心有所不甘；獨身以終罷，未免對不起一生。思前想後，左右爲難，這種精神上的苦悶，每於月白風淸之夜，花香烏語之晨，倍增煩亂。</p>
<p>貧富還是一樣，有錢的老處女有時反更痛苦，因爲一個物質上蛟高享受的人，往往對於精神上的安慰需要更迫切，更感覺得精神安慰人生情趣之可貴。愁柴愁米的朋友，那裏會有那個念頭！</p>
<p>至於她們的命運，很簡單，不甘雌伏者大多「走向社會」而從事各種事業活動；能力薄弱者，吃齋唸佛，則以宗敎作情感上的出路。而在卜少年丈夫者，恐係極少數的例外。</p>
<p>「人到中年兩不堪，生非容易死非甘，」我現在怕也正懷着老處女的心情，那麼，朋友製作的這個燈虎，可謂一語道破矣。</p>

<p>— 先暢</p>
<p>南京是我國的首都，而夫子一廟即是這個首都的心臟。它有着優美的風光，神秘的情調，它是南京的重要畫面而映出南京大部份的輪廓，這是毫無疑問。勝利後，夫子廟比從前增加了不少繁華，這裏非但有秦淮河畔六朝金粉的勝蹟，且是商業娛樂的集中地。國府還都之後，更成了軍政人員的出入塲所。</p>
<p>深夜到了，商店已經緊緊的關閉了門，除了掛著黑牌的幾輛汽車，以及新出世的少數吉普車行駛之外，只有停在道旁的人力車夫，呼呼地睡在自己的車身上，去恢復他們一日中疲勞。在這萬籟俱寂，鴉雀無聲中，各酒家·商店打烊後，呌化子們早就做完了他（她）們的長頸鹿工作，（向富紳顯貴伸着長頸求乞）來到此集中營——泮宮。十足衰疲的神情，覆蓋着蘆蓆，在沙石的地上睡着覺，但道是饑餓的象徵，無疑地像聰明的導演要把「塲面」更裝得貧富貴賤有別，作一點適用「劇情」的需要一般，夜之神已經是成功了。</p>
<p>白天陽光開始從地平綫鑽起来的時候。夫子廟就是從死中蘇甦轉來。黃·黑·綠·　各色的汽車，風馳電掣地閃爍這個夫子廟。商店亦漸漸地拉開了鐵門，傳來一陣陣的小孩子販報聲，各大銜小巷都擠滿了人羣，這些人大半是公務人員要上辦公室去，餘者是一般苦力的工人·小販，他們都在這時候出來掙扎每日中的生活。夫子廟是一個萬花筒；無所不有。一切出奇制勝的廣告，用五彩的綢旗在微風中飄蕩着，美術的漫畫，層層張掛得鮮艷美麗，琳瑯滿目，驚人犧牲「買一送一」大吹大擂的播音繚繞街心，作爲號召。一般來來往往的仕女們，打扮得花枝招展；尤其是一般歌女們，更是塗得像美術雕刻一般；往來在這商業繁盛，中外人仕蒐集的夫子廟，做出她們的流動廣吿。在這百業俱榮的夫子廟——泮宮，也可說是一個失業游民的公共塲所，九流三敎，五花八門，聚集一處，變戲法·賣傷藥。唱小曲，拆字攤，還有一種「江湖藝人」，扮着鬼臉，掉槍花來混口飯吃。的確！自從陽光開始照射直到末落，夫子廟始終在喧攘中過去，不得片刻安寗，每一分鐘，每一處地方，都在攘着呌着，無綫電與　　汽車聲混在一起、呌賣聲與　雜人聲，打成一片，熱鬧和深夜裏死寂的情形完全絕對相反。太陽西墜，接着黃昏更加熱鬧了，商店門上開了霓虹燈，照着一對對的情侶，還有滿面塗着胭脂粉媚人的神女，娉娉嫋嫋，往來於秦淮河畔——夫子廟，尋找她們夜裏的歸宿。微風吹着她們薄似紙的服裝，驚動了露在夜色中的皮肉，然而她們還是對着夫子廟微笑。在這時是夫子廟生意最興隆的時候，遊藝塲，電影院，咖啡館，酒樓和茶室，莫不擁擠異常，門口停下來的吉普車，國大代表接送專車，黑漆漆的汽車，排列成一字長蛇陣；形形色色，各種不同的聲音，和奇怪的燈光，照得引人入勝。夫子廟的繁盛興隆，所以被譽爲首都的心臟地脈，六朝金粉勝地；在這白天，深夜，黃昏的三個時期，可以看得出米。</p>

<p>— 竹溪</p>
<p>（一）</p>
<p>大約在一世紀以前，德國早就垂靑於遠隔重洋的南美洲的阿根廷，作爲它的一個侵略的目的地。德國在阿根廷設立了一個泛德戰略機關，當時阿根廷的民主黨巨頭沙敏托總統，就首先提出抗議。當一八八二年世人對於德國人的活動尙漠不關心時，沙敏托曾經　發德國人的野心，並對國人和南美洲各國發出警吿說：德國人的居留地在阿根廷，巴拉圭，烏拉圭和巴西南部打定基礎以後，總有一天會變成專替祖國效忠的德國人的强大而危險的殖民地。</p>
<p>德國不惜工本，按照預定計劃在美洲大陸上按步就班地進行它的拓殖政策。金錢毫不吝嗇地揮霍着，大量商品源源運入國境，一面開墾荒地，建築學校，獎勵施行，交換學術文化，曾幾何時，德國血統和德國思想已經風靡於阿根廷的許多重要地點了。不久以後，純粹日耳曼情調的德國地區，先後出現在南美各國。</p>
<p>德國毫無顧忌地推選它的積渡大西洋移民政策，在國內通過了一種移民南美的特別法律，公然設立各種工業組織，銀行，學校，俱樂部和硏究機關，專以侵入南美爲目的。到國外去的德國人，都曾受過一種思想訓練，自認爲統治階級的優秀民族。</p>
<p>可在第一次世界大戰時，德國在南美的勢力突吿衰落。所有商業，政治和文化上的一切聯繫完全斷絕，資本的移動亦隨之中止，德國的殖民活動遂入於停頓狀態。美國和她的盟邦就利用了這個機會改進其自身的地位。</p>
<p>在第一次世界大戰以後，世人專心於建設工作，竭力忘去戰爭的殘酷，但求安息和平。可是德國的野心家的頭腦，可沒有一刻休息過。</p>
<p>在德國哲學家克勞塞維茲所持「德國的神聖使命是開化其他民族」的哲理以外，還加添了一種新的科學「地綠政治學」。這些歪曲的學理　惑了一般納粹暴徒，借着「泛德同盟」，各種海外機關和德國外交團的名義實行他們的侵略政策。</p>
<p>赫斯，波爾，戈貝爾和其他納粹領袖，以保護海外德闕少數民族爲詞，組織一種特殊機關，脅迫海外德僑加入德國國社黨，使之成爲德國的侵略武器。</p>
<p>（二）</p>
<p>希特勒的泛德戰略家們，發見英美的商業勢力侵入了南美，同時美國以一種新的開明的政策號召南美各國團結互助，以應付侵略勢力，這時德國乃急起直追，一面鼓吹狹隘的國家主義，對反對者威脅利誘，造成恐怖的局面，一面大事擴張工商業勢力，使英美商業大受影響。</p>
<p>納粹黨用各種手段把南美洲的德國殖民地一一置於該黨管制之下，其中力量最大的是納粹黨的海外支部，該機關自行組織警察隊·情報隊和武裝部隊，所有德僑均須入黨，否則不能在德國商行任事，而有凍餒之虞。</p>
<p>據阿根廷政府調査所得，納粹黨在阿根廷所設立的機關有資金維厚的商業金融機關，大規模的宣傳機構，社會文化團體，學校二百餘所，軍事聯絡站和情報機關。它們的活動經費，一部分由柏林經轉阿京德國大使館發給，一部分向阿根廷德商榨取，一部分由商人自由捐助。這些機關由德國大使館武官和納粹黨特務人員負指揮之責。</p>
<p>德國大使館用於政治上賄賂的金錢，爲數驚人，以致醜聞頻傳，結果政府特規定法律對於任何外國大使館所能運用的資金加以限制。於是阿根廷的納粹黨員竭盡橫征暴歛的能事。德國商會代表人伏爾堡承認在一九四〇至四一年度內曾經募集「救濟金」美金廿五萬元。同時伏爾堡曾經耗資數十萬元，印行德國宜傳機關報El　Pampero，對已故羅斯福總統和泛美主義肆意攻訐，誇言軸心國的軍事成功，並鼓吹黷武國家主義。</p>
<p>德國在阿根廷的宣傳有兩大　題：即美國帝國主義的威脅和德國的宅仁厚，目的有二：一在喚起阿根廷人的愛國心並引起對美國的憎惡，一在煽惑阿根廷人承認納粹德國之世界領導地位。此項企圖雖沒有成功，但意志不堅定的人們到底受到了這種主義的　　。</p>
<p>（三）</p>
<p>同時阿根廷日漸趨向於軍事獨裁，奧底茲總統已於一九四一年將政權移交於副總統卡斯的羅，但是卡氏不能領導被宣傳　得亂七八糟的國家。阿根廷的軍隊大部分是受德國訓練的，高級軍官多數曾在德國陸軍中服役過，對於德國精神極端崇拜，在這些軍人的推波助瀾之下，阿根廷的合法政府卒被武力推翻，一切民主機關都遭陸軍封閉。</p>
<p>在第二次世界大戰中，德國不能履行在墨西哥城所作之諾言。第一·阿根廷不能及時封閉對聯合國實行經濟戰的德國商業機關；第二·阿根廷政府不能封閉軸心國宣傳品，反而封閉了鼓吹民主的報紙。</p>
<p>德國戰收以後，阿根廷仍停留於軍事獨裁制度下。阿根廷人民一日生活於此種獨裁制度下，世界上任何國民一日得不到自由，我們就一日不能高枕無憂。</p>

<p>— 神鷹</p>
<p>讀了少夫先生「金條」一文，提到南京中央日報馬社長的向房東宣戰，不脫書生之見，因而引起了我的同感！</p>
<p>衣食住行，住雖是第三問題，但是動盪不安，威脅生活，比了衣食兩碩，有過之無不及。我家住在蘇州，今年正月，房東來說，它們家屬從軍在後方，現在回歸蘇州，囑我立刻搬塲。我吿訴它一付餛飩担也不能說搬就搬，何况一個家庭呢。到第二天現役軍人來了，「秀才遇到兵，有理說不淸」。在這樣合理的條件下，我心急慌忙的尋覓到了兩間樓房，以一担米的房租，十倍於米的小費，總算不至於住在露天，闖過了這一個難關。</p>
<p>光陰迅速，一幣眼四個月過去了，米價在這一百多天中，竟然高至十倍有奇。一祖米的房租，我再也負祖不起了，適巧地方政府鑒於房屋問題的嚴重，規定租金不得以米價折算。我根據了這規定，邀集了中保同房東開了一個談判，但是結果連一升米也不能短少。就我書生之見，除了獻給房東一石米之外，恐怕也沒有第二個好辦法。</p>
<p>住的問題，第一在於安定，如果天天吵嘴拌舌，一來沒有這個閒工夫，二來精神方面也太痛苦了。官廳打官話，事實不會兌現的。霄生在報上寫文章，多不過亦僅博得一個紙上合理而已。眞要去同房東宣戰。恐怕要屬另一型的人了。</p>
<p>物價高昂，生活艱難，人欲橫流，視錢若命，再不是合理不合理的問題所可解決的。然而住不易的痛苦，我却深深地嘗到了牠的滋味。</p>
<h3 id="c140">進昇飛機 <a href="#c140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>— 南譯</p>
<p>在今日的世界中，飛機已經成爲司空見慣的東西，但是直昇飛機還不多見，至少在中國方面是如此。</p>
<p>直昇飛機的歷史還沒有多少年，但是在戰爭期間已經有重大的發展，應用的範圍一天比一天在擴大。這種飛機在速度方面固然趕不上普通飛機，但是也自有它許多優點。</p>
<p>例如：（一）普通飛機在昇降的時候必須有廣大的飛機塲，直昇飛機祇要一小塊土地就可以了。據說直昇飛機降落起來，位置可以非常準確，假如你在地上先劃一個圓圈，它就可以唯命是聽地，停在這中間。最近美國就有幾家郵局在設法利用　頂、讓直昇飛機在上面降落，因此可以加速郵件的遞送。此外私人準備購置直昇飛機的，也一天多一天，因爲家庭中祇要有一片綠色的草地，上昇下降，就可以從心所欲。</p>
<p>（二）普通飛機能向前直飛，不能停在空中，直昇飛機就能辦到這一點。在戰爭期間，軍隊方面就靠了直昇飛機這一種性能，拯救了許多戰士的生命，凡是作戰人員因失事而落入荒山辭野，或者是漂流於汪洋大海之中的時候，直昇飛機就能飛到這些普通飛機所不能降落的地方，停在上空，放下軟梯、給予遇難者一臂之助。同時直昇飛機對於投擲物品，也比普通飛機準確，有時船隻或者火車失火，直昇飛機就能迅速地把救火藥品，送給船上和車上的救火員，簡直百無一失。</p>
<p>（三）普通飛機祗能在高空向前直飛，而直昇飛機却可以在極低的低空飛行，離地二十五尺都可以，而速度又可以極緩慢，所以轉灣抹角，到處可飛，這對於濆洒DDG等殺蟲藥粉之類的工作，極有用處，將來在防疫，探測諸方面，一定可以有極多的貢獻</p>
<p>目前因爲直昇飛機尙未到大量生產的階段，價格相當昂貴，每架需一萬至五萬美元不等，將來可能減低到每架四千至五千美元。目下美國的製造商已經在這方面大下功夫，直昇飛機的時代就會來臨。（原文載「讀者文摘」五月號）</p>

<p>— 楊謀</p>
<p>有的坎坷，有的得意。學識不一定能保證你的成功，德行也未必能使你飛達。在明顯的對照之下，你常會感到滿懷的灰心，而不得不歸之於命運。</p>
<p>是的，這是最好的安慰自己的方法，但是，這決不是解決問題的方法。</p>
<p>我們不妨相信命運存在，但決不可付託命運。</p>
<p>歷史上盈昃的消長，在讀歷史的我們，常會生莫名的惆悵，因爲歷史的發展，遠不能合我們的理想，歷史上的人物，所遭受到命運的播弄，是書不勝書的。</p>
<p>但是歷史人物之成爲歷史人物，總是他們衝破命運的結果。</p>
<p>灰心，甘受命運所播弄，就將爲命運所排棄。機會要你迎上去找，決不會來找你。失敗一次，多增一分勇氣，相信又接近了成功一步，那末這失敗的代價才不是白費的。</p>
<p>有誰比命運更强大，那便是遇命運而不畏難挫退的人。</p>

<p>江西省府委員兼江西省田賦糧食管理處長程懋型，因督辦購運，懷於任務之未克完成，又不肯輕言諉卸，以致投江殉職，國府特予明令褒揚。而上海則正鬧糧貸大舞弊，同爲一糧官，而賢不肖有天壤之別，言之慨然。</p>

<p>— 馮憶</p>
<p>談目前工潮，以理髮業之內幕最爲複雜，勞資雙方明爭暗鬥，有各趨極端之可能，蓋上海之浴業與理髮業都有大家「白相相」之作風，白刀子進去，紅刀子出來，動動打打，常成爲話不投機之最後法寳。老闆們固肯用錢雇人出力，在後拉綫，但夥計們亦有不可輕侮之拚命硬幹精神，故觀乎今後「暗潮」之發展，仍有夜長夢多之感。</p>
<p>吳市長爲增加工作效率，市府有緊縮　員之舉，本月被載各員有一百餘人，其中包括參事及專員等要員。聞事後頗有不少人員，因與「部裏」有關，輾轉走門路者，但吳市長旣有「裁員」之決心，當不能再有停停用用之矛盾現象，故不問來頭，不賣面子，一律拒絕。衆員亦以吳市長心腸石硬，徒喚奈何。近頃市府各屬機關，吳市長亦有普遍裁員之議，於是羣情不安，互相猜疑不知誰先中「頭彩」？蓋雖說公務人員平時待遇菲薄，但一朝在職，終聊勝於無也。</p>
<p>星島足球隊此次來滬比賽，人氣狂熱，收入不惡，引起此間某足球會後台老板之極大典趣，有意向星東隊某數隊員，「重金禮聘」留滬效勞，現悉雙方正暗中開談判，商談條件之中，惟成功與否，則尙米至成熟時期。但又據另一方面消息，在星東滬比賽完畢之後，亦頗有意再往澳洲一行，並擬向上海球員中挑選數人，加入合作，準備作跨海長征之壯舉。由此觀之，今後星東隊之被人併呑，抑係併呑他人，則全視各人條件之厚薄而定矣。</p>
<p>聯總職員，除薪金之外，尙有配給物可分，惟其中尙有差別者，即洋職員待邁較優。即以啤酒一項而言：洋員可月分三大箱，每箱僅收費三千餘元，而華員則每月祇分一大箱，每箱則須收費一萬餘元。至收費之有高低、聞係海關方面以洋員居於客人地位，故配給物槪予全部免稅。而華員則否也。</p>

<p>— 喬樹民</p>
<p>從霍亂流行病學史起起</p>
<p>霍亂的防制工作，需要各界的合作，多方面的努力，才能收效。就個人衛生言，其要點在謹防病菌入口，並注射防疫針，以增强身體之抵抗力，已如上期本刋所述。就公共衛生言，則亦有其重心所在；不明乎此而盲目從事，鮮克有濟，此我國過去百餘年來之防疫工作，所以大多爲一篇失敗史也。</p>
<p>中國古代本無眞性霍亂，其所謂霍亂，乃腸胃不安上吐下瀉之意，實爲急性腸胃炎或食物中毒之類，並非今日之眞性霍亂。欲以古代流傅之丹方針灸，治今日之霍亂，愚不可及。</p>
<p>在一八一七年以前，眞性霍亂祇局限於印度恒河流域之三角洲一帶。一八一五年，該區洪水泛濫，翌年又奇旱爲災，一八一七年復遭水患，自是而後，霍亂突趨猖叛，由海陸交通孔道，侵擾歐亞美非各洲，引起世界大流行者凡六次。第一次大流行在一八一七年至一八二三年，尙以亞洲爲限；第一次在一八二六年至一八三七年，深入西歐；第三次在一八四六年至一八六二年，歐亞而外，侵及美洲；第四次在一八六四年至一八七五年，廣被於歐亞美非四洲；第五次在一八八三年至一八九六年；第六次在一九〇二年至一九一二年，均以亞非及南歐爲主。百年之間，殺人如麻，往史令人不忍卒讀。</p>
<p>但自一九一二年以迄於今，三十餘年矣，霍亂頓吿絕跡於歐美，獨仍肆虐於中國印度等地，其故安在，是可發人深省者矣。</p>
<p>吾人硏考歐美之近代史實，欲將晚近霍亂絕跡之現象，歸功於某一措施，殆不可能。如海港撿疫之實施，環境衛生之改善，民衆敎育之進步，調査診斷之迅速，隔離消毒之嚴密，預防注射之推行，凡此均有相當之勞蹟。但欲於近三十餘年中，求得一劃時代的措施，以與霍亂突吿絕跡之現象，合其符節，則唯有「飲水消毒」一事耳。</p>
<p>査公共飲水採用氯氣消毒之實騐，發軔於一九〇六年美國芝加哥之實騐室中，幾經改進，旋即廣被採用於歐美各國，自經採用飲水消毒以後之地區，即未聞再有霍亂流行之發生，史實如此，謂非重要關鍵之所在，不可得也。</p>
<p>抑霍亂流行之以給水爲主要的傳染途徑，史例不勝枚舉，漢堡英倫之流行史，其最著者也，蓋給水傳染之流行，恒有下列之特徵，足資鑑別：</p>
<p>（一）病者限於該汚染的給水區域。</p>
<p>（二）病例之分佈，與該汚染的給水之分佈相符。</p>
<p>（三）使用該項給水者皆可罹染是病。</p>
<p>（四）如給水之汚染僅有一二處，則流行之發生，恒爲暴發性。</p>
<p>（五）該項給水有汚染之可疑或證明。</p>
<p>（六）該項給水一且停止使用，或經消毒凈化，則流行頓减。</p>
<p>返顧我中國，霍亂之流行，已有過五十三次之多，而尤以近年爲益烈，死於斯者，，不知凡幾！査我國之有自來水設施，歷史甚暫，在戰前祇限於十七個較大的都市，其中採用氯氣（或漂白粉）消毒者不過七處，即此七處亦限於規模，並未能遍及全市，但其中使用消毒給水之區域，輒能免於霍亂流行之侵擾，豈偶然哉！往事昭然，在有心人領悟運用耳！</p>
<p>防制霍亂的工作，自不限於給水消毒一事，需要各界的合作，多方面的努力，前已言之。但其重心所在，不可不明。重心與中心有別，防疫工作，可以衛生敎育爲中心，可以預防注射爲中心，可以檢疫留檢爲中心，可以隔離消毒爲中心，可以調査病源爲中心，可以改進環境衛生爲中心，亦可以治療患者爲中心，要當因地制宜，因時制宜；使各項防疫工作得其應有之配合與連繫，以赴事功。但防制霍亂之工作重心，不可不置於給水消毒一事，重心者，側重着重之點，悉力以赴，不可稍忽之調。「射人先射馬，擒賊先擒王」，防制霍亂，亦猶是也。値此舉國震攝於虎疫之際，切忌慌張失措，願我人咸能以冷靜之頭腦，察其重心，以積極之行動，共謀撲滅。</p>
<h3 id="c145">診斷第一！ <a href="#c145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>— 林兆耆</p>
<p>臨床醫生的主要任務是診斷及治療，在診斷未確定前，對病的治療，是無從着手的。因此臨床醫生的口號，是「診斷第一」，尤其着重「病源診斷」。診斷好像一把鑰匙，沒有牠不能打開「治療之門」及「豫後之門」。</p>
<p>近十年來有磺胺類藥物及靑微素等劃時代的發明，治療各種細菌性傳染症。造福人羣，誠匪淺鮮！無怪轟動全球，婦孺皆知。但是特效藥的合理使用，須有準確的診斷，否則南轅北轍，不僅暴殄天物，抑且辜負良藥，有時並加害於病人！故治療學雖有突飛猛晋的發展，臨床醫生仍奉「診斷第一」爲圭臬。</p>
<p>診斷學是綜合解剖學生理學生物化學病理學細菌血淸學寄生蟲學放射學等的基本學術來應用到每個病案上。病人是活的，病源如細菌寄生蟲瘤細胞等，也是活的，因爲這雙重「活的因素」彼此作用的關係醫學與其他科學如化學物理等不同，二　一　定化合爲水，而水有牠不變的性質。雖然傷寒桿菌侵入人體後釀成傷寒，但是各個傷寒病人的症狀，並不相同，併發症的發生及豫後的好壞，也大有出入。我們要知道病人的體質心理營養抵抗力年齡性別環境等不同及傷寒桿菌有種類侵入數量及毒力的差別，以致形成錯綜甚至迷惑的症狀。診斷家除綜合應用上述基本學科外，尙須運用他的想像力辨別力配整力及判斷力。</p>
<p>確定診斷的方法，槪括的說，有以下十種：（一）搜集詳細精密的病史，（二）全身檢査，（三）血液分泌物排泄物滲透物及滲出物的化騐，（四）愛克司光線透視，（五）使用診斷器械如食管鏡胃窺鏡枝氣管簽膀胱鏡乙狀結腸鏡腹膜鏡陰道鏡眼底鏡檢喉鏡檢耳鏡等，（六）心動電流描記，（七）新陳代謝測定，（八）活體檢視，（九）探察手術，（十）屍體剖檢。</p>
<p>上列各種診斷法的靈活運用，全賴主治醫生的善於選擇，因病制宜。例如心冠狀動脈血栓形成症，則病史病微及心動電流措記可資確定診斷。流行性腦膜炎非檢査腦脊液及血液中細胞反應及細菌，不能完全診斷。</p>
<p>從診斷的立塲言，疾病大體上可分爲三咱：（一）診斷是顯而易見的如枝氣管性氣喘等。當然要找出引起枝氣管性氣喘的「變應素」，是一件最頭痛及往往勞而無功的事。（二）經過相當的時期及硏究如細菌血淸檢騐後，診斷始可確定的，如傷寒等。（三）有時雖盡量利用最科學的方法，甚至病人死後屍體剖檢，也無從診斷。這顯示近代科學醫學尙未臻完美之境；有待全世界醫學從業員的努力，其他科學從業員的協助，及全人類的鼓勵。</p>
<p>人類具有天賦的好奇心求真心及耕耘收獲時的愉快感。尤其是醫學及其他科學從業員，視硏究及探求眞理爲人生的眞諦及樂趣。職是之故，診斷學可說是臨床醫生人生眞諦及樂趣的泉源及醫療工作的鑰匙，難怪他們要大聲疾呼的高喊「診斷第一」！</p>

<p>陳禮節博士原是平大醫學院·西北聯大醫學院·福建醫學院的敎授，光復後陳長官電邀來台，担任台大敎授曁第二附屬病院的院長。他是負有調査日人醫學研究的使命的，在他調査時首先發現由台大日籍敎授桂重鴻（醫學院）和野副鐵男（理學院）所發明的兩種肺病「特效藥」，一種是屬於防已科植物的塞伐蘭丁Cepharanthin和從台時產的檜樹油精之一成份純粹分離成功的左旋性洛丁酸L_Rodinsaure，（其後尙有氫添加物幷野副所發現的羊毛脂肪酸，）前者從醫學上來看對於咳血和發熱的治療是有副作用的，後者則已有醫治百分之二十重症肺病者的成效。咯痰中結核桿菌的逐漸减少，胸部Ｘ光像慘性的陰影减退消失以及赤血球沉降速度的遲緩以至復原，其他生理反應的改善都是好證明。過去是總督府斥資硏究，光復後和其他事業一樣停頓了，陳博士發見以後，則於二月下旬據情報吿陳長官，說明類於此項研究有繼續的必要，於是他開始了籌備硏究計劃。</p>
<p>·治療硏究計劃·</p>
<p>陳博士在長官口頭允許硏究之後，即草擬計劃，將於本　內提呈長官公署批准實行。這個計劃裏，是暫以台幣一百五十萬到二百萬的資金作爲事業費，硏究者都是台大有關的八個敎授，分別就臨床，有機化學，病理解剖·組織·藥劑·藥理·生理·細菌學方面負責硏討這樣作爲結核硏究所的主要骨幹。第一期是初步研究，第二步是成立硏究所，第三步是擴大硏究成立實騐病院。將借用現有的台大醫學院和第一·二附屬病院的設備暨六至十二個研究員，十至十五的副研究負助理硏究員工作着。</p>
<p>據陳博士說：因爲檜樹產量雖多，而提煉成分却很少，百噸槍油祇能得百公斤，千分之一〇·一％卽是一百公斤洛丁酸，衹於供一千個病人一月之用，所以同時將自雄刈黃草所得右旋性雄刈萱酸（Citronellic　Acid）和構造相類似於洛丁酸的香葉酸（Ｇeranis　Ａcid）（也是脂肪酸的一種）三者混合為一來比較研究，要較單獨硏究更有成效。</p>
<p>·三月後能生產·</p>
<p>陳博士得到國内很多人的來信，並附款購買這種特效藥，他表示很抱憾的說：現在所存的只能供十個病者半年之用，假使這個計劃趕快付諸實施，而委託承雙的專賣局高砂化學加工廠沒有問題的話，那末二三月後就可以維持以前的常態，而源源供給國内和本省。他深信檜樹油容或有匱乏的一天，而本省產量頗豐的雄州萱草是可以經常取作原料作爲補充的。</p>
<p>在他的計劃裏，療養院的設立，也是主要事業之一，將來準備在國內各地成立硏究所，藉這個研究所的力量，展開抗癆和防癆的運動，他是具有信心的。</p>
<p>陳博士對記者說：肺病是世界病，中國更是一個肺病最多的國家，佔所有人類病症的首位，所以利用現有的物力得到硏究特效治療的成功，不　爲人類給予最大的福社！他很遺憾的說：關於以脂肪酸治療肺結核的病理，現在還未能發表。</p>
<h3 id="c147">與霍亂傳染有關的：兩種飮食習慣 <a href="#c147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>— 郭可大</p>
<p>關于霍亂的一般預防法，已在本刋的上一星期裏介紹過，現在我們再就日常飲食習慣上應該改革的兩件小事來討論一下：</p>
<p>（一）水果消毒法：一般說來，水果不但是味美的淸凉食品，而更重要的是新鮮水果裏含有多量的維生素，特別是丙種維生素。像橘子，枇杷，和葡萄之類的水果，原來高高地生在樹上或是藤上，並不和汚水或是大便接觸，以乎是不曾有病原菌附着在果皮蠅可以將病原菌帶到果皮上去，二，採果子的人，尤其是販賣的小販，時常用汚水或是用普通沒有煮沸過的生水來洗滌，因此很容易將病原菌附着到果皮上去，至於荸薺和地瓜之類的水果，根本就生長在泥土裏，都不免曾用大便來做過肥料，所以這些水果的皮上，除去附着有病菌外，還可以有寄生蟲的卵和囊包。</p>
<p>至於消毒的方法，一般人都認爲用刀削去果皮後就沒有關係了，其實這一種見解是似是而非的，用刀削皮後固然可以將皮上的大部分細菌除去，可是在削皮的過程中，已經不知不覺地將水果的内層也汚染上細菌了，還有些家庭的主婦習慣地用凉開水來洗滌水果，認爲這樣就消毒了，其實這祇做了消極的一面，因爲凉開水對於原來已經存在於果皮上的病菌，却一點都沒有殺滅的影響。所以這也不是合理的消毒法。</p>
<p>從科學的眼光看來，水果的消毒法應該依據着兩個原則去做：（一）應該用一種方法將表皮上的細菌和寄生蟲卵殺死；（二）應該不使水果裏面的維生素含量受到損失，依據這兩種原則，在化學工業發達的都市裏，固然可以應用過孟酸鉀等，氯化消毒劑來殺菌；可是這在我國的工業經濟現狀下，並不能普遍地施用，在我國行得通而且合乎科學原理的水果消毒方法很簡單，祇要把水果泡在滾熱的開水裏面三分到五分鐘左右，那表皮上的病菌便很快地被殺死了，同時將小刀也同樣處置，然後用這消過毒的刀削去果皮，而在整個的操作中絕對避免用手指接觸新削出的果肉，像這樣預備好的水果，吃下去後，可以說再也不容易引起普通的腸胃傳染病了。</p>
<p>（一）合理的用膳法：照理，霍亂弧菌旣然不能耐高熱，在攝氏一百度的環境裏即刻就可以殺滅，那在煮熟或是炒熟的熱菜裏，是絕對不會有霍亂菌的，可是實際上這在我國却有問題，在我國洗家庭裏特別是菜館裏，通常吃飯時用的碗筷盆碟都是用生水來滌的有時還用汚穢不堪的「洗碗水」，而洗完後再用病菌集中營式的「抹布」來抹乾一下，這樣洗滌過的碗，在表面上看起來像是乾凈了，其實正好把病菌散佈到碗碟的全部，然後病菌和菜飯一齊吃進肚子裏去，俗語說得好：「眼不見爲凈」，不過倘若我們的肉眼，換成顯微鏡的話，那眞怕死人了，因為在霍亂流行時，祇是一滴洗碗汚水裏，就可以含有幾千個生活的細菌呢！所以這一種用冷水或是汚水洗碗的壞習慣，實在是非改革不可。</p>
<p>實際上，合理的洗滌法非常簡單：先將碗碟用普通的冷水或溫水洗凈，放在水鍋裏去煮沸十分鐘左右，然後取出用潔凈的白布巾（最好是用開水煮過而　乾的布巾）擦乾就行了。用這樣煮過的碗碟來盛熱的菜飯，吃下去是決不會有霍亂傳染的危險的。所以不論在普通家庭或是菜館裏，所用來盛菜飯的碗碟筷子等，一律要在開水裏煮過。特別是在菜館裏，我們應該要求廚師用新煮過的滾熱的碗具來盛菜飯，否則拒絕食用。</p>
<h3 id="c148">心悸 <a href="#c148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>— 陶壽淇</p>
<p>心悸，就是心在跳動的感覺。其實，凡人活在世上一刻，他的心臟終是一分不停的跳着，而這種跳動，平時不使我們感覺，也不受我們注意。所謂心悸，卽指心跳而使我們自己感覺到的意思。當發生心悸的時候，跳動之感覺，可限於胸部，或波及頭部或全身，往往使人不僅覺得心跳或心盪，而同時感到一般的不舒服，甚至慌張及非常難受。</p>
<p>追究心悸產生的原因，不外乎下列兩種因素的各別或合併作用：（一）心臟搏動的變化，如速率過快或過慢，力量過强，及節律不規則等。（二）神經感覺之過敏。人體對於各種感覺如疼痛，發熱等等，各人的敏感性大有差別，而於心跳亦是這樣。這兩種因素的影響，具有相等的重要性，因爲感覺較遲鈍的人，就是對於非常快或者不規則的心搏動並不覺得，而感覺過敏者，則心搏動稍微加强或加速，就可能發生心悸而覺得很不舒服。</p>
<p>根據上述兩點原因，可以將能發生心悸的情况，分爲以下三類：</p>
<p>第一類可以說是生理情况。無論什麼人，當劇烈運動的時候，心臟跳得比平時快而强，結果就會發生心悸。要是平日不慣於運動的人，因了身體各部份對於應付勞力時的需要，未曾受到相當訓練，所以到了運動的時候，心悸比較格外厲害。精神過於興奮，或是受到驚嚇的人，同樣的，亦會發生心悸。還有精力疲勞的時候，亦容易使人心悸，原因是一方面心臟本身疲勞後容易跳得快，另一方面，神經疲勞後就變得特別敏感。這一類的心悸，差不多每一個人都經歷過的，亦是心悸最普通的原因，但是，因爲各人神經敏感性不同，所以有些人比別人容易心悸。</p>
<p>第二類是根本無心臟病而在各種傳染病，發熱病的過程中，以及許多疾病的恢復期中，由於心搏動加快，或由於神經過於敏感，心悸亦是一個常見的症狀。</p>
<p>第三類是心臟本身的病。心臟病之所以產生心悸的症狀，有時因爲心作用受到妨礙後，心臟變肥大，結果跳得強而快，有是却因爲心搏動的節律變成不規則。</p>
<p>這樣看來，大多數的心悸，或者是正常的人對於有些生理情况的一種反應，或者是產生於與心臟本身並無直接關係的病程中。這類的心悸，都是臨時性的，絕對不可認爲是心臟病的現象。至於少數由於真正心臟病引起的心悸，到了這時期，就一定有確實而明顯的心臟病的現象，可以檢查得到，因此，心悸與心臟病，不該同樣看待。如果有人對本身「心跳」發生疑問，就應當找一位可靠的醫師詳爲檢査究竟有無心臟病。否則，愈懷疑，愈注意，則神經　變過敏，而心悸的現象，亦就　加厲害。一旦養成了畏懼或誤　有心臟病的心理，到了根深蒂　的時候，就一時不容易糾正，倒反而無病中生出病來。這類由於心理上錯誤而發生的非眞正的心臟病，是很常見的，但亦是應該避免的。</p>
<h3 id="c149">DDT及其用法 <a href="#c149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>— 張昌紹</p>
<p>這個夏大，大家都在談着DDT，是越聽得多，越覺得關於此殺虫聖藥的準確報道還不够普遍，尤其是關於他的應用方法。</p>
<p>DDT是這次大戰中醫學上兩種最大發明之一，另外一種就是靑　素——配尼西林。DDT能撲滅各種虫類，對於爲害人類最烈的蠅，蚊，蝨，蚤及臭虫等，部有撲殺的效能。其最大的特點是遺留效力：一次用藥後，DDT的殺虫效力可以遣留數日，數星期乃至歡月之久。因此，DDT對於表面上爬來爬去的蝨子，跳跳蹦蹦的跳蚤和夾絲裏鑽出來的臭虫，效力特別大。用藥後最初一二日也許還有漏網之魚，但是再經過幾天，便能全部肅淸，無一倖免。</p>
<p>要獲得DDT的最大效果，必須按照虫的種類，採取適當的應用方法。現在許多人在馬路上隨便買一瓶藥水，用噴射器在屋子裏東噴一點西噴一點，實在不能發揮很大效力。第一，攤頭上好些啤酒瓶的DDT實在不是好貨，有的DDT含量不够標準，有的索性是十足假貨，是一瓶煤油或汽油貼上DDT標簽面騙取一二千元。這種劣貨假貨白然不能發揮什麽效力。第二，就是買到良好的DDT，如此隨便噴噴，也是難收實效，近乎浪費。</p>
<p>在講到準確用法以前，先得介紹DDT的性狀，因爲他的特殊性狀決定他的用法。</p>
<p>DDT是一種透明的結晶或白色的細粉，性極穩定，不易愛壞、亦不易揮發逸失。所以他的溶液一經噴射在牆上或用具上，其殺虫效力可以維持很長的時間。因爲他在水中不能溶化，所以曾經用DDT處理的衣著被褥，即洗滌多次，仍能保持其效力。各種油類如豆油生油菜油桐油等，以及能去油跡的種種有機溶劑如汽油煤油　醋　以及火酒等，均能溶化DDT而配成溶液。常用之DDT溶液係其煤油溶液，每一百公撮（Ｃ.C.）中含DDT五公分（gm.）</p>
<p>至於DDT之殺虫作用也必須一提。DDT的作用在麻痺昆虫神經系統。昆虫棲止在已噴藥液之表面上時，DDT即很快被吸收而發生毒性。中毒以後，最初神經受激刺而亂飛亂動，不久即現麻痺而翻倒地上，最後全身麻痺而死。因此DDT的殺死虫類需要相當時間，此時間的長短，隨藥液或藥粉中有效成分的濃度，昆虫的種類與虫藥接觸的時間而定。如採用百分之五的溶液，蒼蠅和蚊子大概要經過半小時左右才死，臭虫要經過數小時乃至一二天才死。</p>
<p>許多人以爲DDT有立刻殺虫的效力，有的以爲DDT能使虫類不來，這都不確實。老式的殺虫藥如除虫菊能立刻殺虫，而美罩中採用的驅蚊藥水，塗在皮膚上能發出一種氣味，使蚊子不來。DDT雖沒有這兩種作用，但是他持久的遺留作用，能常期殺虫，故有一勞永逸的妙處。</p>
<p>DDT對於人畜也有相當毒性，所以食物和食具上不可噴藥。其溶液亦能自皮膚吸收，吸收太多亦可中毒，所以不能用溶液來擦在身上，但是粉劑和乳劑則不能自皮面吸收，可以用來殺滅身體上的種種昆虫如頭蝨白蝨陰蝨和跳蚤等。上面已把DDT的性狀詳細介紹，現在可以講到應用的方法。</p>
<p>對於能飛的昆虫如蒼蠅和蚊子，DDT的應用並不能使屋內蠅蚊完全絕跡，除非裝有紗窗或注意關閉窗戶。裝紗窗紗門的房子。加用DDT可繼續殺滅偶然竄進來的虫子、而補充紗窗紗門的不嚴密處。若無紗窗設備而又不能注意關閉窗戶，則DDT僅能减少而不能完全消滅屋內的蠅蚊。用藥的原則是使屋内任何表面均有藥跡，使蚊蠅進屋後一經複止，即與藥接觸而中毒致死。用法可分噴射油漆與粉刷三種。噴射法用DDT之煤油溶液，油漆法用DDT溶化於桐油或油淡內，粉刷法則用DDT細粉密切混和於膠粉内。DDT之濃度，普通以百分之五爲最合式。普通以噴射法為最便，噴出的點滴以恰像毛毛雨爲適宜。着種的噴射器將藥液成霧狀，停留空中，不易　物，並不適用。如無適當的噴射器，則再用毛刷將藥液刷於天花板與牆壁门窗。刷時口鼻部須戴上用水潮潤的口罩；刷後將窗户敞開，使溶劑揮發，約經四小時後始可住人，溶劑揮散後遺留白色的藥跡，在玻璃上尤爲明顯，其效力可維持一二月之久。粉刷和油漆法的藥效可維特三月左右。家庭中最需要用藥的處所是廚房和厠所，其對象是蒼蠅；其次是晚上工作的地方和臥房，其主要對象是蚊子。</p>
<p>目前一般人用飛立脫式的喷雾器來噴DDT，每晚在房裏東噴一下西噴一下，有時在空裏對着蚊子噴，這是犧牲了DDT的特點，勉強所他當做老式的殺虫劑如飛立脫之類來用，實在等於浪費。如此用，在室裏確也能打倒幾個蚊子，但是噴出的細霧最後與塵埃一同降落地面，不能發揮其持久作用，很是可惜。並且如此用法，他的效力也不如飛立脫之類，因爲DDT沒有立刻殺虫的作用，至於噴霧時所得的微弱擊倒作用，實在由於溶化DDT的煤油，DDT本身無關。如果天天應用，房裏的人經當吸入其細霧，也許可以產生慢生中毒現象，極不妥當。</p>
<p>對於臭虫，DDT的效力比較對於蠅蚊滿意多了。溶液比粉劑爲佳。每個床（括包床架床　被褥和枕頭）約需溶液半磅，則可殺死全部　虫，用藥一次，效力可維持數月。床　床架可用　　蘸藥水刷之，被搙枕頭等物則用噴射器噴之，使　　　　爲度，上面噴好即翻過來噴其下面。至於床　裂縫不必特別處理，因當臭虫從夾縫裏　出來覓食時，在途中即接觸藥跡而中毒，無倖免之理。用　　　口罩，用藥後亦須打開窗戶，通風四小時，使煤　　，即可住人。</p>
<p>DDT藥粉，內含DDT百分　乃至百分之十，適用於殺滅蝨蚤等虫。白蝨是回　　與斑疹傷寒傳染的媒介，DDT對於醫學的最大　　，即在撲減白蝨，控制上述二病之流行。其應用屬　公共衛生當局的專門範圍，在此不加叙述。如個人　現身上有口蟲蚤，可用DDT藥粉撒布内衣上穿之，　　上亦撒以藥粉。對於頭　和陰蝨，則須採用DDT溶液擦於毛髮部分。此處應加注意，DDT溶液不　　於身體上殺虫，因有吸收中毒的危險，粉　興　　　無　危險。</p>

<h3 id="c150">江河之戀 <a href="#c150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>— 石碚</p>
<p>一·南明河</p>
<p>一提起貴陽的風景，大家都不會忘掉嫵媚的花溪，但花溪是離城二十多里的地方了。在城內唯一的風景地，我想應該是南明河了。當烽火流離的時期，我在南明河畔，度過了一個隆冬和一個初春的季節，我賞識了江河的靜美，和自然的明澄潔樸。</p>
<p>在多雨又沉寂的貴陽，只有南明河是明朗可愛的。小小的江灣流水，常是如鏡般平靜；沒有船艇來往，四季的河水都是一樣地淸湛。祗有帶着　駑的小魚船，三三二二如結隊般地盪漾在江心。</p>
<p>靠着河濱公園前面的江灣，闢有天然的游泳池，那邊河濱的古樹深幽，綠映波流，長隄石道，潔凈無塵，夏天炎暑，此地便成爲全市最堪留連的地方了。</p>
<p>冬天裏，我最愛看南明河兩岸的積雪，皎皎的雪光，反映在凝成一塊薄薄冰層的河面上；河邊的樹枝，結着一串串的冰柱，欲墮未墮地倒掛着。雪壓新橋的倒影，恰成一幅苦寒古的畫像。</p>
<p>那年的冬天。一連下了幾場大雪；每天淸晨，在雪映爭燦的朝氣裏，我便沿着南明河畔，轉到河濱公園的山上踏雪去了，歸來時，我還去看看我和孩子們築的雪人，是否是損壞了。</p>
<p>現在離開那邊，一別又是好幾年了，什麽時候，我能再回到南明河邊，去尋找當日雪裏的留痕呢？</p>
<p>嘉陵江，這美麗又淸脆的名字，不少人對她生無限愛慕與嚮往的情感；似一條不大不小的絲帶一樣，她飄繞在巴山蜀水間；在重慶的身邊，給這喧嘩的山城不少靜謐而柔和的調節。</p>
<p>在霧季的時候，白霧掩沒了山川，站在江邊，看霧氛漸漸消散，江景便隱隱約約的展開在你的眼底；一葉葉的帆影，穿出霧圍，慢慢移近前面。倘在濃霧經久不散的晨間，你佇立江干，連渡頭的影子也看不見了，祇有很稀落而又緩慢的船櫓，擊着水聲一。茫茫的霧海呑沒一切，在這樣的時候，你設法雇了一個小划子，小心地搖開去，隨船舷輕盪，眞如駕雲神遊的味道。</p>
<p>嘉陵江最淸澈的時候，是在春天裏，兩岸的小麥和胡豆，飄着芬香。在縉雲山下的沙灘上，是最理想的春郊試馬的塲所，去北溫泉的遊人，都在這裏的試馬塲，騎着馬揚鞭追逐。</p>
<p>夏天和秋天裏，嘉陵江水漲了，道是船民運輸最忙的季節，一淸早江邊便飄揚着船夫和絳夫們的歌聲了，在烈日的下面，這些勤勞强壯的江之子，個個都是赤裸裸地，自然的健力和豪放，留在他們的足跡踏過的沙灘上。</p>
<p>待冬天到來時，嘉陵江又沉入霧季裏了。</p>
<p>我愛嘉陵江，像我愛在江邊度過的一串日子一樣。一年來寄跡江濱，在這段時間裏，我沒有一天離開過她，每天的黃昏，我散步在江濱，看江心的風帆帶着夕陽歸來，看江上的黃昏星，熌着第一度的光芒……</p>
<p>江河之戀是深摯的，我愛江河，如愛熌熌明澄的生命，爲此，我懂得去尋找質樸的生命，江河、我要爲你們而歌！</p>
<h3 id="c151">獄中散記（四） <a href="#c151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>— 姚車</p>
<p>辦理一件案子，要經過檢察官的偵察起訴，要經過推事的再三審理，調査證據，還得由律師替你辯護，推事判決不公時，檢察官還可以提出抗吿，當事人不服時，也可以層層上訴，……可說是非常完備的了。我常常在思索着，爲什麼還會有那許多不合理的事實發生呢？我發現了人民的知識水準太低，許多善良的老百姓們，對於法律簡直是矇矇憧憧，一無所知，而法律却是那麽複雜，像是一張天羅地網，一不小心便要碰上了，這時便手足無措，任人擺佈，或者誤觸法紀，或者陷於「三字寃獄」了。</p>
<p>同時，我又深深地感覺到，法律是最有伸縮情的一種事物，並不像一般人所想像的那麽呆板和鐵面無私。</p>
<p>在這裏，一個判處了死刑的犯人，倒並不一定會死，而一個宣判無罪了的人，却已經坐了三五年的寃獄，或者甚至病死在牢裏。</p>
<p>所以，在這裏，人們都深信着一種叫做「命運」的事物。而認爲是無法抗拒的。</p>
<p>在這裏，人們對付「命運」的辦法，第一是「賴」——這是「一字人公堂，九牛拉不出」的一種反響，我想不必再加註釋；第二便是「拖」，如果你的官司沒有必勝的把握，便把時間拖畏着（上訴便是「拖」的一法），讓人們抓不到把柄，不了自了，况且，時間一拖長，人事變遷，「苦主」也沒有了，沒有人與你作對，便可設法保釋出去。</p>
<p>但，「命運」眞是不可抗拒的嗎？我就看見有人從她的手裏溜了出去……。</p>
<p>自由的期待</p>
<p>近些日子以來，我本期待着恢復自由。</p>
<p>但是，這一段期待的日子，是最難挨過的。一個橫被寃枉，失去了自由的人，一旦聽說寃情可以伸雪，得以重見天日了，那時的心情，當然是一陣興奮，但是這興奮的情緒是不能持續多久的。當一陣興奮過後，繼之便百感交集，而且，一天挨過一天，却不能馬上跨出這靈牢的門檻，這光景，是一分鐘也挨不下去的。</p>
<p>我深深地感覺到，一個人坐牢，就是剛進來的那一段時日，和快要出去的那一段時日，却是最難排遣的。</p>
<p>當一個人從自由的天地裏，被下到牢獄裏的時候，自由被剝奪了，一切都受到限制，就像一隻猛虎被困在獸欄裏，感到了無限的痛苦，如果是受了寃枉的話，那更是滿腔的氣憤和委屈，一直煎迫着你的心，不可抑制，激動得太厲害的時候，甚至叫你想尋死，用死來作爲你的不平的控訴。所以，每個監所裏對新來的犯人，都特別加以防範。</p>
<p>不過，這一段時期是短暫的，也還容易挨過的，因爲人是最善於應付環境的動物，只要過得十天一個星期，也就漸漸地習慣於這種苦難的生活，况且，假如你舉目觀看周圍的同難的人們，你便可以發現比你更寃枉的還多着呢，這也帮助你冲淡了寃抑的情緒。同時，你還有着希望，你相信你不至於彼無辜定罪，你還得用你全部的心力去設法如何洗雪自己的寃情，因之暫且按捺下滿腔的憤慨。雖然在漫漫的失眠的長夜裏，當你越想越氣憤，直到無法排逍時，心裏難免會湧起一種自殺的衝動，但這是容易克制的，因爲你有不能死的理由，爲了你的寃情尙未伸雪，你是不肯做下這種親者所痛仇者所快的傻事的。</p>
<p>縱使你被寃枉定罪了，被判決了要在這裏住上個十年八年，那倒也沒有什麽了不起，當然，接到了判決書的時候，你是非常地難過，但是，在你是已經盡了人事了，你再也無法抗拒這「命運」的支配了，同時，這事總算也有了個結果—雖然是不幸的結果—不用再提心吊胆了，倒也鬆了一口氣，况且，這裏的生活對你也是已經習了的。於是，只得收拾起創傷的心，把希望伴同着寃抑和憤慨深深地理藏了起來，跟外界完全隔絕，把日子也給忘掉，混混沌沌地過下去，時間倒也是過得飛快的。雖然你覺得一日有一年之久，但偶爾回顧一一下，一年也又如一日。</p>
<p>但是，當你總到說你遇着了一大赦，或者被宣判無罪，不久就可以恢復自由了。這時，你心裏重新起了一陣騷動，那感情開始是相當地混亂和複雜，你興奮得說不出話來，笑也不是，哭也不是，眼眶裏飽孕着激動的淚水，你坐下來，想把這份激情鎭定一下，但又想起來走動走動，把這包藏不住的歡欣吿訴任何一個人。</p>
<p>一天挨過一天地。每天早上起來，你都懷着一個希望：「今天可以出去了吧！」你不時不時地走到木柵子門裏，從那方格子窗洞中探望着，人們還是照樣地做着自己的事情，似乎誰也不來理會你的心情，或許你想找個人跟他談談關於你的喜訊；但對方也不過淡漢地答應着：「也許總快了吧？」好容易挨過了這漫長的一天，一點動靜也沒有，到了晚上，重新打開那收拾好了的準備出去的舖蓋，嘆了一口氣，倒在床上，又復勾引起許多起伏的思潮……。</p>
<p>這些日子里，你的希望重又抬頭了，你想起了家，想起了親朋戚友，想起了事業的前途，想起了一切的一切……，想到了高興處，你就喜笑，想到了沉痛處，你就流淚……。這時，你又想起了你這些日子里所遭受的一切，從頭到尾地思索着。想起你受人家的陷害，以致坐牢受苦，使你的家庭蒙受損害，你的事業受了影嚮，你的時間，精力和經濟，卻受到了無法補償的損失，你　　生的努力，全給毁了，甚至你的至親和所愛的，也都因此而受苦受難，……想到這里，你會覺得你的寃屈是無比地大，你更會覺得你的仇恨是無比地深沉。你從來沒有想得像現在這麽透澈過，雖然你的寃屈現在已經伸雪了。</p>
<p>當你晚上想得氣憤時，你會揑緊拳頭，恨恨地搥着床鋪，因而把睡在旁邊的難友給吵醒了。如果那仇人就在眼前的話，你會得一拳把他打死，而情願犧牲那即將得到的自由，以之作為報仇的代價，而沒有絲毫的顧惜的。</p>
<p>我以着最大的能耐，期待着自由的來到！　（完）</p>

<p>爲了詩人節，許多地方都談起了屈原。各人的談法如何，我沒有一一詳讀，不大了然。但我也有一些意見，不妨附驥一下，在這裏談談。</p>
<p>也許對於屈原的自殺，大衆都是同情的。自然我也很同情他。可是我絕對不贊同他的自殺，更不贊同他那樣示弱地自殺，</p>
<p>儒家「知其不可而爲之」的精神，我很佩服，爲什麽他就不能知其不可而爲之呢？如果要博得後世的同情，知其不可而爲之，也是可以辦得到的，何况其結果還不單博得後世的同情而已呢！爲了一些氣惱，「自經於溝瀆」，爲親者所痛，仇者所快，實在不値得！</p>
<p>萬一天下事眞正不可爲了，非死不可了，更非自殺不可了，的確，也應該找一二個應死而可殺的人，與之拼命，同歸於盡。近代杜威夫人（？）曾說過，「我不自殺，如果要自殺，先殺幾個應殺的人。」這話，我想在古代也未嘗不可以通用。「予及汝偕亡！」就是這種精神的表現。</p>
<p>自從屈原那樣自殺之後，留下來的影響可以說是很壞的。二千多年來，中國文人再也不想振作，一遇到挫折，只有「形容憔悴」，「行吟澤畔」那一副可憐相，然後，如果不和屈原一樣，跳到水裏去，也往往嘔血而死。在現代，我們再也不需要這種文人了！</p>
<p>現代的文人，如果遭遇了和屈原一樣惡劣的命運，被同列所害，不能發展他的抱負，根本用不着自傷，尤其用不着自殺！做一點是一點，此路不通還有別路。反正是服務社會，服務國家，個人的榮辱成敗，儘可置之腦後。自傷或自殺，未免太顯着自己，一心與雞驚爭食。反而忘了自己應負的使命。」</p>
<p>萬一上官大夫，靳尙之流，實在壞透，吃他虧的不止你一個，有許多人，而許多人竟無奈如何，那末，也儘可以以自殺的精神，斷然去之！「蠭靈有毒，而况人乎！」我不信一個文人果然會文弱得手無縛雞之力！眞正手無縛雞之力，不能一擊而中時，那還有「三寸不爛之舌」以及「三寸不律」呢，口誅筆伐，何嘗不會發生一些作用！再不然，就是撞死在他的門上，也比悄沒聲地跳在水裏要有些積極的意義。</p>
<p>時代到了現在，我們再也不需要屈原式的文人了；「五步之內，以頸血濺大王」的狂士，倒很使我們憧憬。現代的文人應該振作起來：「惡聲至，必反之！」「以眼還眼，以牙還牙！」只要這種報復不純粹爲了個人的利益。</p>
<p>屈原已經死去了二千多年，就讓他這樣過去吧。我們同情他，却不値得大吹大擂地捧他，沒的捧出毛病來，叫現代的文人受了氣的時候，也去哭哭啼啼做盡醜態，而終於「短見身亡！」</p>
<h3 id="c153">治黃商榷（三） <a href="#c153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>— 褚同安</p>
<p>（丁）進一步黃河的整治並利用</p>
<p>支河上游蓄水池的建造　我們知道北方匪特黃河不時有水患，即黃河的支流，亦不時可以泛濫成災，像前面所舉的洛水，就是一例。而這些水，在四，五月間，往往乾涸得僅剩一條河槽，這種河流，當然只受其害，而無從受其益了。如能於各支河上游適當的地方，設置若十蓄水壩，那末這些支河的沿岸，便只受其益而不受其害了。我們知道北方的冬天，大多積雪，尤以較高之山頂與山陰，往往至三四月間方才溶化，這些積雪所溶解的水，如能容納於蓄水池內，而在五六月間最乾旱的季節裏，緩緩的洩出來以灌溉下流，必能大大的减少因亢旱而造成的災難。而在夏末秋初，大雨來時，山洪暴發，則各個蓄水池儘可能的把水蓄積起來，以减少黃河水閘的蓄水負擔。這樣旣能防旱，又能防水，使各支流經流的地域，盡蒙利之益，水實爲整治黃河不可勿略之事。</p>
<p>（二）大森林的建造　森林調節水旱的潛力，是大家所熟知的。古代華北的山區，滿佈着森林，由於歷來只知濫伐而不加修植的結果，便都變成荒蕪的童山了。現在計劃在晋陝甘的北部，以及察北和綏南一帶，建造一橫互的大森林，這森林通過黃河流域各上游地帶，那末黃河和各支流的水旱必日益减少。在現代用科學方法吸水以灌漑，而在荒蕪的童山上造林，已非不可能之事，故愚意若能在這些地帶用人工造成了一座縱深數里綿互千里的大森林，則匪特黃河水患，永可寗息，而北方早災也可獲得解決了。但這項艱巨的工作，不是短時期內所可吿成的。</p>
<p>（三）黃河下游的灌漑計劃　華北大平原在五六月間往往苦旱，黃河旣爲華北唯一的大河流，自應充分利用其河水以作灌溉之用。昔賈讓曾建議用分水渠以灌溉河北境，現在此法自可更進一步運用科學技術以應用之。愚意在黃河南北，各鑿一運河，北向的沿太行山而至於易水；南向的縱貫河南南部諸川，而至於淮。在平時使該二運河保持一定水量，以利交通。遇旱時則用水閘以控制黃河之水使流入此二運河，以增河中水量。並於運河兩旁，多穿溝渠，以利灌漑，則北方水利，必將因此二運河之開鑿而益收宏著之效。</p>
<p>（四）西套附近新渠的設計　「黃河百害，惟富一奮」，這句古語說得眞是最確切沒有了；因爲黃河在五原附近一帶，人們　了許多川渠，引用河水灌漑，遂成塞上天府。現在計劃由五原的責河口，鑿一新渠，直至包頭以北，在此新渠兩旁，再縱橫穿　若干支渠，而於新渠與黃河交口處，建造新式水閘，以控制水量，則此新渠兩旁百萬頃土地，均可獲灌漑之利，其經濟上價値，較之薩拉齊附近引大黑河水而造成的民生渠，必將更見有利。</p>
<p>（五）唧水工程和陰山以北的灌漑　記得蘇聯在第二次世界大戰前，正埋頭實行五年計劃時，因莫斯科河水量太小，不能使較大的船直達莫斯科，於是裝置了一組世界上最大的唧水機，以吸取莫斯科以北數十哩某河中的水，以增加莫斯科河的水量，而使較大的輪艦，得以直達莫斯科。現在綏遠省的陰山以北，有着一塊一向不被人注意的「黑土地帶」，這塊黃河流域裏罕見的黑土地，却因無法獲得水源而荒蕪着。毗連這黑土地帶的陰山和黃河的距離，僅約二三十里，假使能從黃河掘一河道，向北直至陰山南麓，便可引黃河之水至陰山南麓，即於其地裝置一組巨大的唧水機，以吸取此河道中水，通過陰山，而抵北麗的黑土地帶。陰山山脈蘊煤極當，幾乎隨處都是，便可就近開發，作爲唧水機動力之用。一旦黑土地帶獲得此項水源，便可濬鑿若干渠流，以儲受此項水　，作爲灌漑之用，那末千百年來一向荒棄著的陰北二縣數百里的黑土原野，將獲得良好的灌漑，而可能成爲華北最好的農田了。這一件工事省，所費不多，而獲益甚大的水利計劃，一向尙未有人注意，是特別應該提出來討論的。</p>
<p>（戊）附錄（關於楊孟明君所提治黃計劃的討論）</p>
<p>近閱五月十日申報所載楊孟明君「化水患爲水利」一文，覺得有許多地方，値得商討，爰將鄙見錄後，以供治黃之參考。</p>
<p>（一）楊君以爲河患的主因，在於「挾沙過多，致下流淤塞」，這一說，未敢贊同。世界上各大河流，往往都有泛濫之災，像美國的密西西必河及其支流，有史以來，泛濫過許多次，漂沒農田廬舍，有時達數州之廣。其原因由於流域內雨量太多，河流水位激增，河道不能容納，遂使兩旁田地因而漫沒。又如尼羅河的泛濫，是由於阿拉伯海的潮風每年定期吹襲阿比西尼亞附近，造成雨季，於是靑尼羅河與白尼羅河的流量激增，下游河道不能容納，遂致泛濫；因爲雨量有定期，所以泛濫也有定期，於是埃及人受到泛濫之益了。其實黃河之成災，其主因也由於六七月間流域內發生的大雨，使水位激增；致於「挾沙過多」，這不過是泛濫的副因罷了。</p>
<p>（二）楊君主張治河端在易道，俾使挾沙減少，與江水相若。此點必須討論：第一，照楊君所擬的河道，主張上流聲過烏鼠山的谿谷，引黃河之水入渭，這各整治法，是不是可以減少黃沙盡由烏鼠入渭。下三岔口至陜，三岔口地形陟直，水流必急，而關中土質，也是黃土組成，自必多所冲刷，較之原來的河道，挾沙程度，恐亦未必有顯著的減少。第二，開鑿烏鼠山的工程過大，絕非現時中國經濟力所能負担。第三，由於黃河水量不定，當水漲時，若經流四百里的關中平原，自必難保其不發生泛濫，那末本來上游不必提防的水患，這一來，倒反而要多一層防治了。</p>
<p>（三）楊君對黃河下游的整治，主張由黃入淮，再由淮經東海附近而出海，如此則較原河全程增多約二百里，始則由東南流而入淮，繼則田東而折向東北流以入海，路程旣增，又多彎折，欲如楊君所謂收「冲暢直注之效，」恐不可能。楊君揭　「冲暢直注，」爲整治黃河下游的要著，此說誠中肯要；然由中牟至鳳台，所經乃黃土平原最鬆最低之地帶，欲使「冲暢」，殊非易事；蓋地勢過平，即使黃河流量正常，泥沙亦極有沉積的可能；旣有沉積，則河床勢必變淺，河身勢必變高，又安能「冲暢」？而引黃入淮，在楊君以爲可使「直注」於海，殊不知黃旣入淮，則淮河上游的各支流，勢必捨黃河莫能歸；這些支河，正如楊君所說的「沙河，」一般可成水患；蓋當黃河發水之時，也正是淮河和這些支流發水的時候；那末併黃河之水於淮河，豈不使淮河的水患更嚴重了嗎？流程多了二百里，又不可能使之「冲暢直注」，相反的倒多了二百里的水患地帶，豈不弄巧反拙！且改易河道，談何容易，莫說烏鼠山開鑿困難，即自中牟經鳳台而入淮一段，必須挖掘新河，工程也是相當浩大的。而黃河舊道，據最近實則，則僅加淤二公寸至一公寸餘，若加疏濬，旣不勞民傷財，亦可事半功倍。</p>
<p>（四）楊君所說黃河易道之後，黃淮並路，而使黃河下游，大舶能直溯周家口，使成爲漢口相等的商埠；此點亦須商討：蓋黃河水　，一般的要比長江小得多了，除了大水發時的水量驟增外，其餘時期，其水量僅及長江的一條支流；此乃天生的缺憾，縱使改易河道，亦無濟於事；所以在水量限制的情形下，而欲巨舶直航周家口，殆爲不可能之事。</p>
<p>筆者因看到楊君之文，覺得有許多地方，不能不提出討論，遂匆促寫成此文，因手頭參考資料不多，所以疏漏錯誤之處，在所不免，還請大家指敎。（完）</p>

<p>— 趙清閣</p>
<p>廖老闆為什麽不也開掉了寳鈴呢？一則因爲他體念仕家之後，他和墨老爺總算有過往來。二則寳鈴不但做了記賬的工作，而且帮助了廖楝念書，寳鈴是吃的一份糧，幹的兩份活兒。爲這件事又使老闆娘不滿，儘管廖老闆解釋給她以上的理由，但老闆娘却更氣，老闆娘的氣由嫉妬中來，她覺得廖老闆之留下寳鈴。完全是爲了廖棟。按她的意思，呌廖棟輟學在回春堂記賬，旣可以省去一個記賬員的開支，又可以省去廖棟念書的花消；一舉兩得，再好也沒有了。可是廖老闆不肯這麽辦，廖老闆的姑惜廖棟，便是偏心前房兒子；偏心前房兒子，便是還愛着前房的老婆；根據這個邏輯，雖然前房兒子現已被騎在她的胯下；前房老婆也早化爲泥土了；，但依然禁不住酸溜溜地醋性發作！這種下意識的心理變態，是她所不能自覺的。這也是一般作續弦妻子的現象，她們自己說不出個所以然來，而別人又無從理解她們這種複雜的微妙的情感。</p>
<p>老闆娘對廖老闆有了成見之後，越發地懷恨着廖棟！廖棟的一舉一動，都引起她老闆娘的憎惡！儘管廖棟萬分小心地拘謹着，但總沒法取老闆娘的歡心。爲了這，廖棟有一天忽然澈悟了，他向寳鈴很沉痛地說：</p>
<p>「看來只有我不在這個家裏，我的後娘才會開心，我的家裏才能太平！」</p>
<p>「是的！」寳鈴說。他不禁暗暗贊賞着廖棟的聰明。「你的話一點也不錯，除非讓她忘記了你的存在，她才會滿足地生活，你也才能好好地上進！」</p>
<p>寳鈴的啓示，更深給了廖棟一個覺醒，同時他便開始萌了像寳鈴一樣—離開家的念頭！他在想試着「站起來」，但是，離學「走路」不遠的很！談何容易？離開了家往那裏去？他還小的很哩！于是他茫然，也越發的悲哀了！</p>
<p>老闆娘也忽然聰明了起來，她想出了一個兩全其美的可以在廖棟身上抵償所有損失的代替，她把這妙策興高采烈地吿訴了廖老闆，她用非常善意的口吻說。。</p>
<p>「棟兒已經是十二歲的人了，過了年就是十五歲。也該替他留心點親率。我想給他討房童養媳來，一則我整天忙樑兒一個人都忙不過來了，自然顧不了棟兒。討個比棟兒歲數稍大的女孩子，可以照應照應他，你也省了操心。二則，將來夥計們都開掉了，家裏打雜的人手就缺了，棟兒還得上學，也作不了什麼，如果有了媳婦，也可以幫幫我們料理家務，總比外頭雇來的人貼心可靠些。而且外頭雇來的人至多不過幫你個三年五載，自己的媳婦是可以幫你一輩子的。老闆娘一本正經地講了一大派道理，乍聽，廖老闆不甚同章，一經思索，倒也頗以爲然，於是考慮了一會兒以後，便欣然答應了。</p>
<p>「要得！只是哪有那（仍讀「冷」音）個合適的媒岔兒呢？」</p>

<h3 id="e1">Bai Rude and Others to Fly to Beiping Today and Transfer to Shenyang; Northeast Ceasefire Under Negotiation; Zhou Enlai May Make a Trip to Shenyang <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 13th] The overall situation is developing amidst contradictions. War has ignited and intensified in the Northeast, Hebei, and Shandong, where Communist forces are active. Meanwhile, negotiations in Nanjing show signs of progress. In the past two days, Marshall has frequently visited Chairman Chiang and met with Zhou Enlai, keeping him exceptionally busy. It is reported that Marshall, during his visit to the Chairman, inquired whether there were any plans or proposals for a permanent solution after the expiration of the fifteen-day ceasefire agreement. This clearly demonstrates Marshall's desire to seize the effectiveness of the negotiations. Currently, he is pursuing two very practical and important matters: (1) assisting Xu Yongchang in discussing military issues with Zhou Enlai, and recalling Bai Rude to assist in drafting a Northeast ceasefire plan; (2) having Yu Dawei directly negotiate with Zhou Enlai on resolving the restoration of transportation issue. Observers believe that negotiations between the two sides have entered a concrete stage.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 13th] General Bai Rude arrived in Nanjing and visited Zhou Enlai at Meiyuan New Village at 10:00 AM on the 13th to discuss matters related to the Northeast ceasefire and the dispatch of executive groups to the Northeast. It is reported that Bai Rude is scheduled to fly to the Northeast with Li Minran and Wang Shoudao on the 14th. The personnel for the Northeast Executive Division of the Military Mediation Department have been decided: the American representative is Major General Bai Rude, the government representative is General Cai Shoulian, and the Communist representative is General Rao Shushi. After this news was released tonight, a reporter visited a certain gentleman in relevant circles and inquired about the hope for a Northeast ceasefire. According to him, whether the establishment of the Northeast Executive Division of the Military Mediation Department can immediately begin work will depend on whether the Communist forces in the Northeast are willing to quickly withdraw from Lafa.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 13th] General Bai Rude is scheduled to fly to Beiping on the 14th and then transfer to Shenyang. The return date of Colonel Hill, the head of the Transportation Management Section of the Beiping Executive Department, is yet to be determined. As of the 13th, there are only eight days left until the ceasefire deadline. Currently, war reports are frequently received from North China, causing the government to be extremely anxious and the people to be deeply worried. The Communists, however, are still employing their old trick of "fighting while talking" to confuse the people and trouble the government. News reporters run their legs off every day, but they cannot obtain any news that can comfort the people, and they all cry out in despair. This afternoon, some people heard that Zhou Enlai would revisit Ambassador Marshall, while others said that Zhou was waiting quietly for a reply from Yan'an. It is rumored that Zhou has telegraphed Yan'an about Ambassador Marshall's suggestion that the Communist forces in the Northeast withdraw from Lafa, and he is now indeed waiting for Yan'an's reply to be forwarded to Marshall. It is also rumored that there will be significant developments in the overall situation within the next three days, so that people will not have to wait in vain until the 22nd.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Shenyang, 13th] Xiong Shihui, Director of the Northeast Provisional Headquarters, will travel to Nanjing within the next few days to visit Chairman Chiang and consult with various ministries and departments on all matters concerning the Northeast.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Shenyang, 12th] Communist representative Rao Shushi stated to Director Du that Zhou Enlai may come to Shenyang within a day or two to discuss the Northeast ceasefire issue. Lin Biao may also make a trip to Shenyang, but this will be decided after Zhou Enlai arrives in Shenyang.</p>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 13th] Zhou Enlai stated: He did not demand the extension of the ceasefire deadline as a condition for continuing negotiations.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 13th] An authoritative source told reporters that the clarification of the Northeast military dispute will not wait until after the 15th. If the Communist forces do not withdraw from Lafa within three days, the National Army will not be able to sit idly by and watch the ceasefire order be torn up.</p>
<h3 id="e2">Ambassador Marshall Invites Yu Dawei for a Meeting; Preliminary Agreement Reached on Restoring Transportation <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 13th] It is reported that during the meeting between Marshall and Zhou Enlai yesterday, a preliminary agreement was reached on the restoration of transportation. This morning at 10:00 AM, Minister of Communications Yu Dawei was again invited to visit Ambassador Marshall, and Colonel Hill, the head of the Transportation Management Section of the Beiping Military Mediation Department, also participated. The meeting lasted approximately two hours, but the content has not yet been announced. According to a certain source, based on the results of the transportation talks over the past three days, although the Communists have expressed their willingness to discuss and resolve the restoration of transportation, the Communists' increasing military actions have become a major obstacle to the restoration of roads. If the Communists try to avoid the important and dwell on the trivial, intending to be perfunctory, how to ensure that the repair work will not be obstructed again during its progress must be carefully considered in advance, so as not to be ineffectual. Granting Ambassador Marshall the final arbitration power and strengthening the arbitration power of the American representatives of the Executive Department's ceasefire group and transportation group are particularly necessary. It is reported that the Ma-Yu transportation talks at noon today discussed this, and now they are waiting for Zhou Enlai's reply.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Changchun, 13th] The Communist forces that invaded Lafa continued to vigorously attack the Xiaogujiazi area (six kilometers west of Lafa) on the 10th. The National Army stationed in the area was forced to defend itself and repelled them on the evening of the 11th. Furthermore, the National Army stationed on the north bank of the Songhua River was attacked by Communist forces that had sneaked in from the vicinity of Taolaizhao on the evening of the 10th. The National Army did not drive them back until the morning of the 12th.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 13th] The Communist forces attacking the vicinity of Yingchengzi, Qianhoumafengtun, and other places southeast of Haicheng from Ximucheng were repelled by the National Army on the 9th and fled back to Ximucheng. The National Army only restored its original defensive positions and did not pursue them.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 13th] Due to the increasing intensity of conflicts in various regions, the Chiefs of Staff of the Government and Communist sides of the Military Mediation Department held a special meeting yesterday afternoon. Government Chief of Staff Cai proposed to quickly dispatch additional groups to Shandong for mediation, and the Communist side also proposed to dispatch three additional groups to northern Jiangsu and northern Anhui for mediation, as conflicts were particularly fierce in the northern Jiangsu and northern Anhui regions. As a result, the following was decided: (1) The 21st group, which had been recalled from Gaomi, will be dispatched to Jinan to be transferred to the conflict areas; (2) Three new groups will be dispatched to Rugao and Gaoyou in northern Jiangsu, and Dingyuan in northern Anhui. The above four groups will depart in the next few days.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Beiping, 13th] Guan Jiyu and Peng Jiqun, the chairmen of Songjiang and Nenjiang provinces, respectively, flew from Shanghai to Beiping on the afternoon of the 14th. They are scheduled to exchange views with the governors of various provinces in Beiping and then immediately fly to Shenyang.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Changchun, 13th] Personnel from the Jilin Provincial Government have been successively traveling from Changchun to Yongji, and many security teams have also traveled by car. Liang Huasheng, who also serves as chairman, will fly to Yongji on the 14th to assume his new post.</p>

<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 13th] A senior government official stated tonight that General Marshall has intervened in the Communist forces' attacks on Shandong Province, especially Qingdao. The official stated that Ambassador Marshall "condemned" the Communist forces' actions of initiating attacks on Shandong Province during his meeting with Zhou Enlai yesterday. At the same time, a Communist official denied today that the Communist forces had any intention of attacking Qingdao and asserted that no accidents would occur there.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Qingdao, 13th] Admiral Cooke, commander of the U.S. Seventh Fleet, returned to Shanghai this evening after consulting with various officers of the Marine Corps here.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Qingdao, 13th] Admiral Cooke, commander of the U.S. Seventh Fleet, flew here from Nanjing at 6:00 PM on the afternoon of the 12th, carrying Chairman Chiang's handwritten order to Ding Zhipan, commander of the garrison, instructing him on the defense of Qingdao. Cooke then convened a meeting of senior officers, including Major General Clement, commander of the U.S. Marine Corps stationed in Qingdao, and invited Commander Ding to participate, inquiring in detail about the Communist forces' recent attacks on Qingdao City and its surrounding areas.</p>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 13th] The headquarters of Special Envoy Marshall is extremely concerned about the situation in Qingdao. Before flying to Qingdao, Admiral Cooke, commander of the U.S. Seventh Fleet and the U.S. Marine Corps in China, met with Ambassador Marshall in Nanjing. He was not willing to discuss the content of their conversation. The headquarters has received reports on the developments in Qingdao.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Qingdao, 13th] Major General Clement, commander of the U.S. Marine Corps stationed in Qingdao, sent Lieutenant Colonel Nelson and Communist representative Hao Ding to Linyi by U.S. military plane on the 13th to meet with Chen Yi, commander of the Communist New Fourth Army, hoping that he would stop the Communist forces' military actions of invading Qingdao and the Yongyuandi area surrounding Qingdao City.</p>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 13th] A Communist spokesman announced today that the Communist military has ordered a halt to the attack on Qingdao. This order was carried to Shandong Province by a Communist representative and an American military officer.</p>
<p>Jianqiao Regenerates from Ashes; Aviation School to Reopen Tomorrow (Zhu Minwei from Hangzhou)</p>
<h3 id="e7">The Flight Training Program of the Hangzhou Jianqiao Aviation School, Which Has Been Silent for Nine Years, Will Resume on June 15 <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>After the aviation school was reorganized from the aviation class of the Central Military Academy in 1931 until the start of the full-scale War of Resistance Against Japan on August 13, 1937, it educated six classes of flying generals. The first battle in the skies over Hangzhou on August 14 was initiated by these six classes of flying generals, marking the beginning of aerial resistance against the enemy. From then on, hundreds of flying generals from the six classes shed their blood in the clear sky, fighting enemy planes everywhere. In the autumn of 1938, the seventh class graduated from the Kunming Aviation School, and new blood continuously joined the air force. After the eleventh class graduated, the Kunming Aviation School had to relocate due to enemy air raids and the difficulty of supplying gasoline and aircraft. The United States generously agreed to help, and from the twelfth class onward, intermediate and advanced flight training was conducted in the United States, while primary training remained within Yunnan Province. In 1943, the primary class was moved to Lahore in northwestern India for instruction, but the instructors were still Chinese. Training continued until the 25th class.</p>
<p>The fifteen years of the aviation school symbolize all of China's experiences. In the first five years, it prepared for the War of Resistance Against Japan through diligent training. In the second five years, it was covered in blood, sacrificing itself to preserve the righteous spirit of the airspace and protect the people and the army on the battlefield. In the last five years, it turned defeat into victory, receiving assistance from allied nations and attacking the enemy with abundant energy everywhere until the national flag and the air force eagle flag were raised again at the original site of the Hangzhou Jianqiao Aviation School.</p>
<p>The past history of this school has been manifested in the eight-year history of the Chinese Air Force. From Shen Chonghai, who crashed into an enemy warship at Bailonggang, to Yan Haiwen, who committed suicide under an enemy regiment in Jiangwan, to Zhou Zhikai, who shot down three enemy bombers from a single plane over Liangshan in Sichuan, to Gao Youxin, who flew eight sorties a day to bomb and strafe the enemy forces besieging Hengyang, these are all lofty examples of dedication and success by the students of the aviation school. Generals Mao Bangchu, Huang Guangrui, Chen Qingyun, and Zhou Zhirou, who were responsible for running this school, deserve the honor. The honor given to their principals and the nation by these thousands of air heroes who threw their bones on the battlefield or successfully destroyed enemy planes and warships is greater than the reputation given to old principals Zhang Boling, Mei Yiqi, and Situ by the students of Nankai, Tsinghua, and Yanjing Universities. Only because the war has ended and the deeds of the heroes are buried under the busy pursuit and distribution of living materials, no longer considered valuable or valued, will the passage of time slowly erode its profound form in China's history of independence. The reopening of the Hangzhou Jianqiao Aviation School at its original site can be said to be a commemorative day for inheriting past glorious history and preparing to create future brilliance. On June 15, the Jianqiao airfield, which was covered with deep grass, was cut and made smooth and flat. Sixty Steaman training aircraft, flown back from India over the Hump, were arranged neatly. The instructors, who had endured over ten years of airfield wind, rain, and sunshine, as well as the hardships and dangers of the eight-year war, stood tall in front of the training aircraft they had flown back.

<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 13th] Military news: The Communist forces' military conspiracy to attack Qingdao by land and sea in Jiaodong has now been thwarted.

The National Army is now firmly defending the outer perimeter of Qingdao. The U.S. Marine Corps in Qingdao is assisting the municipal police in maintaining order and protecting foreigners. The responsibility for defending Qingdao rests entirely with the National Army. The National Army's morale is greatly boosted because it can be supported by both sea and air. Therefore, although Qingdao has declared martial law, the people's hearts are extremely secure.</p>

<h3 id="e16">The Truth About the Communist Army's Continued Offensive: Published by the Ministry of National Defense (Continued from Previous Day—End) <a href="#e16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>Furthermore, after the ceasefire order in the Northeast took effect, the Communist army attacked National forces in various locations in the Northeast and launched fierce offensives against communication routes in Shandong, Hebei, and Shanxi provinces. Their aim was to coordinate with the Communist army's operations in the Northeast and seize cities and territories during the opportunity. Here is a summary of the reports from military commanders in various areas regarding the Communist army's attacks.</p>
<p>"Shandong Area": The Communist army launched a full-scale general offensive into Shandong province on the 7th. (1) Dezhou Airport was captured on the morning of the 8th, and Dezhou city was captured on the evening of the 10th. The military and civilians were bombarded by Communist artillery, resulting in heavy casualties. (2) On the 7th, a part of the Communist army invaded Liaocheng, but was driven out by the defending troops. Fighting continues outside the city gates. (3) Taian city is under heavy attack, and fierce fighting continues. (4) The Hanzhuang Canal railway bridge was blown up on the 9th. (5) Dakou is under heavy attack, and street fighting has broken out. (6) The railway west and east of Licheng up to Hancang (5 kilometers east of the city), and the Zhangxia-Qingyangshu section of the Jinan-Taian railway bridges, were all destroyed on the evening of the 7th. (7) Zhoucun is under heavy attack, and the situation on the 9th is unclear. (8) Zhangdian was captured on the 8th. (9) Changle, Linqu, and Gaomi are all under heavy attack by the Communist army. (10) The Communist army has entered Jiaoxian, and fierce street fighting is ongoing. (11) Lancun, northeast of Jiaoxian, is under attack, and the current situation is unclear. (12) The Communist army has launched heavy attacks on Xiazhuang, Huangbu water source, Liuting Airport, and Chengyang Station, all on the outskirts of Qingdao. The railway bridge between Cangkou and Nugukou, and the tracks between Nugukou and Chengyang, have all been destroyed. (13) Zaozhuang, which has been besieged for several months, was subjected to another general offensive by the Communist army at 7:30 PM on the 9th. They used explosives to destroy the tunnels previously dug leading into Zaozhuang city and destroyed the command headquarters of the defending troops under Wang Gang. Subsequently, they launched a heavy attack with large forces, leading to a breakthrough and street fighting. The fate of the defending commander, Wang Gang, the American representative of the executive group, Massey, the government representative, Yin Zhiqiang, and his entourage are unknown. Team leader Wang Jimei was wounded and his whereabouts are unknown. (14) The outskirts of Jinan are under heavy attack by the Communist army, and the fighting is fierce.</p>
<p>"Hebei Area": (1) On the 9th, the Communist army launched a heavy attack on Changxindian (south of Beiping on the Pinghan Railway). The defending troops were forced to defend themselves and drove them back. (2) The Communist army has gathered its main forces and surrounded Yuanshi, posing a threat to the city. (3) On the 10th, the Communist army launched another attack on Yongnian city, which has been besieged for over nine months, and fighting is currently underway.</p>
<p>"Shanxi Area": (1) At dawn on the 8th, the Communist army launched seven fierce attacks from three directions on the northeast of Zhongyang city. (2) On the evening of the 7th, the Pingyao-Yaoquan section of the southern section of the Tongpu Railway was destroyed by the Communist army. The Pingyao engineering section sent workers three times on the 8th to rush repairs, but they were attacked by the Communist army and forced to retreat.</p>
<p>Based on the above facts and the past situations since the issuance of the first ceasefire order on January 10th of this year, where the Communist army violated the agreement and repeatedly attacked National forces, it is clear that the Communist army has no regard for the nationwide desire for overall peace. The Ministry hereby makes the following statement regarding the current situation: (1) The Communist army should abide by all agreements and promises, immediately cease all military actions, and await mediation. (2) If the Communist army again engages in capturing cities, seizing territories, and attacking National forces during this ceasefire period, causing the National forces to be forced to defend themselves, the Communist army shall bear the responsibility. (3) The government's forbearance and efforts to seek overall solutions have their limits. It is hoped that the Chinese Communist Party will not engage in empty talk and create unnecessary complications to delay matters. They should focus on resolving the issues and concentrate their efforts on restoring transportation and implementing military reorganization plans to achieve peaceful unification and national construction. If they continue to take advantage of this negotiation period, intensifying their actions, and causing the negotiations to become impossible, creating a serious situation, then the responsibility shall be fully borne by the Communist side.</p>

<h3 id="e17">Actively Promoting Urban Construction: Chongqing Plans a Ten-Year Plan; Tang Honglie Discusses Three Major Current Issues <a href="#e17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>[Report from Chongqing by this newspaper on the 13th] Chongqing Mayor Zhang Lun reported in the municipal meeting: Chief Zhang of the Xingying returned to Chongqing from Nanjing, and relayed President Chiang's extreme concern for the security of Chongqing city. It is hoped that serious attention will be paid to safeguarding it. He also expressed his great expectations for various construction projects in the city, instructing to follow the established plan and carry it out seriously. Therefore, the police bureau should immediately pay serious attention to the two items of public morals and security in the city. As to how to closely contact the military and police, and how to cooperate with the district security, the police bureau should quickly draft effective measures and submit them for approval and implementation.</p>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Tang Honglie, Secretary-General of the Chongqing Municipal Government, came to Shanghai on official business yesterday and gave a speech, saying: Since the central government returned to the capital, Chongqing is still the political, economic, cultural, and transportation center of the southwest. Currently, the Chongqing Municipal Government, in order to actively promote urban construction, has drafted a ten-year construction plan based on President Chiang's handwritten order. Building the Two Rivers Bridge, repairing the city's sewers, and completing the northern trunk line are the three major current issues. The northern trunk line project has already begun and is expected to be completed within three months. As for the sewer repair work, it is expected to be completed within one year after construction starts. The total budget requires over 3.45 billion yuan. An American expert, Mr. Mauriel, has been hired to be responsible for the design, and a loan of 2 billion yuan has been obtained from the Four Banks Joint Office, so construction can begin. The next is the Two Rivers Bridge project. President Chiang has approved an allocation of one-third of the total funding, which is currently being claimed from the Executive Yuan, and a loan is being sought from Canada. However, because the project is huge, the Chongqing Municipal Government has submitted a request to first complete the construction of the "Zhongzheng Bridge." This bridge is located from the Dongshuimen Wharf to the opposite side of Xialongmenhao, with a total length of 980 meters. The bridge is divided into two layers. The upper layer is 12 meters wide, enough for four-wheeled vehicles to drive side by side. The lower layer has two sidewalks, each 3 meters wide, for rickshaws and pedestrians. The total construction cost is estimated at over 6 billion, and it is scheduled to be completed in two years. A bridge expert, Mr. Mao Yisheng, has been hired as the director. Construction can begin as soon as two-thirds of the funding allocated by the Executive Yuan is received.</p>

<p>[Report from this newspaper] Zheng Baonan, director of the Washington branch of the Executive Yuan, participated in the UNRRA Far East Conference after returning to China this time. He recently came to Shanghai from Nanjing. When a reporter visited yesterday, Zheng first mentioned the request to UNRRA to extend its working time in China. According to him, this request has been submitted at the conference. The European side also has this intention. Representatives from China, the United Kingdom, and the United States have drafted a proposal and established a group to decide on it before July 17 (the date of the next UNRRA Far East Conference) to submit it to the Fifth UNRRA Conference to be held in Paris on August 2. Zheng said that the possibility of approving this request is extremely high.</p>
<p>Regarding transportation work, Zheng said that the current transportation situation can be divided into three stages: The first stage is that the railways from Shanghai to Nanjing, Hankou, Hangzhou, and Tianjin can be said to be unobstructed. The current work focuses on the second stage, which is from Hankou to Hengyang and Changsha, and the third stage, which is from Hengyang and Changsha to remote small towns in the interior. The work is expected to have satisfactory results in the autumn of this year. The ship transportation situation is the same as the land transportation situation, also divided into three stages. Work is now underway to gradually send ship transportation tools to remote counties in the interior.</p>
<p>At this point, the reporter raised the food problem that China urgently needs to solve. Zheng said that before this problem, we must first recognize a fact, that is, food is lacking in all parts of the world, not just in China, and each country has its own prejudices. Take the United Kingdom as an example, helping Siam will naturally be ahead of China. Zheng solemnly pointed out that the relief food received by China in June, July, and August of this year can be greatly increased because the harvest period in Europe is June, and the amount of relief needed during this period is not much. The reporter then asked how the Executive Yuan and UNRRA should strengthen cooperation in their work. Regarding this point, Zheng said that the Executive Yuan and UNRRA have always maintained a very good relationship, and it is hoped that they will be able to cooperate even better in the future. Both sides have mutual criticisms, but these criticisms are well-intentioned, and the goal is to make the work have greater progress.

<p>[Report from Nanjing by this newspaper on the 13th] Before the war, the provincial capital of Anhui was originally located in Anqing. After the victory, it was changed to Hefei. According to a senior official of the Anhui Provincial Government who came to Nanjing to speak to reporters, the Anhui Provincial Capital will soon have to be moved back to Anqing. The reason is that although Hefei is located in the center of Anqing, transportation there is inconvenient, and the buildings are not as good as Anqing. Therefore, the post-war restoration of the provincial government in Hefei was actually of a temporary nature.</p>
<h3 id="e20">Two Factories in Guangzhou: A Beverage Factory Manufactures Beer and Soda; A Textile Factory Is the Largest in South China <a href="#e20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>[Report from Guangzhou by this newspaper on the 12th] Yesterday, the reporter visited the Guangdong Industrial Company's beverage factory and textile factory. The former was reopened on October 1st of last year after being taken over. It can produce 50,000 bottles of beer and 300,000 bottles of soda per month. The latter was established in July of the 22nd year of the Republic and is the only textile factory with the largest scale in South China. It has 20,000 spindles, but most of the machines were damaged after the occupation. The factory's machines are made in the United Kingdom, and the products are very good. However, the weaving part has not yet been restored. The spinning part is currently only operating 5,000 spindles, producing 75 bales of yarn per month, which is 30,000 pounds. It is estimated that it can only supply about one-fifth of the city's needs. In addition, Lan Xun, the general manager of the company, said that the company's main business is to develop industry, and the principle is to support private industry, and will never compete with the people for profit. For the revitalization of the Guangdong silk industry, a silk industry production chain committee will be established to assist in the development of the province's silk industry.</p>
<h3 id="e21">Dai Representative Arrives in Yunnan to Present a Flag: Discusses the Life of Border Ethnic Groups; Hopes Compatriots in the Interior Will Help Develop the Border Areas <a href="#e21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>[Aviation dispatch from Kunming by this newspaper on the 10th] Nan Tianfu, a representative of the Dai and Kawa peoples of the Cangyuan Establishment Zone, arrived in Kunming a few days ago to report the situation of the border area to the Yunnan Provincial Government and present a flag to Chairman Lu Han. Nan told reporters yesterday: Cangyuan is adjacent to the Kawa Mountains (the undetermined border between China and Myanmar) in the west and is often attacked by the Lao Kang (savages). The Lao Kang have superior firearms and new tactics, and they often use guerrilla tactics to invade the border people, intending to occupy the important strongholds of Ban Nong and Kawa Mountain. Although a part of the National Army is stationed in Ban Hong and Cangyuan City, it is inconvenient to go deep due to certain reasons, so the border people feel extremely uneasy. I hope that compatriots in the interior will give more guidance and assistance to develop the border areas as soon as possible. He also said that if the director of the Cangyuan Establishment Bureau is a suitable person, the Kawa princes near Cangyuan, such as the Ban Hong King, Yonghe King, Manjiong King, and Shaoqing King, may all return to the motherland. When the reporter asked about the living conditions of the border people, it was said that the Kawa people are divided into "wild" and "pure", and the Dai people are divided into "water" and "dry." The pure Kawa are slightly similar to the Han people, while the wild Kawa have the legacy of ancient ethnic groups. The Kawa people live on the top of mountains, and the Dai people mostly live on plains. The Kawa language is difficult to understand, and the Dai language is relatively common and easy to learn. In recent years, there has been trade and intermarriage between the Dai and Han people, and the Han language is becoming increasingly popular. Dai and pure Kawa men like to learn from the Han people, and their clothing, food, and accommodation are similar to those of the Han people. Women still maintain their native costumes, wearing short tops and long skirts, and like to wear silver ornaments. The Dai people like to eat glutinous rice sauerkraut, while the Kawa people do not pay attention to hygiene in their diet. Marriage is very free. If a man and a woman love each other, they can get married even without the consent of their parents. Before a man is married, he can talk and laugh with any girl, but this is impossible after marriage. Men like to play the sanxian (a three-stringed plucked instrument), and if they gain the love of a woman, they can live together. Parents are proud of this. The border people are very superstitious, and they are mostly harmonious with each other, especially the Dai people who are the kindest. The wild Kawa people still have the habit of taking heads, but they are not as barbaric as commonly said. Nan traveled for 29 days on the way to Kunming this time and plans to return to Cangyuan after presenting the flag.</p>

<p>[Report from Hangzhou by this newspaper on the 13th] It rained heavily here all day on the 13th. More than 10,000 students from sixteen middle schools still held meetings and parades in the rain to demand an immediate ceasefire. They decided to issue a declaration and continue their strike. Slogans such as "Demand the CCP cease fire and protect the lives of public and teaching staff," "The beautiful mountains and rivers must not be divided, and territorial sovereignty must be complete," and "Oppose the opening of inland waterway navigation rights" were posted all over the streets.

<p>[Report from Chongqing by this newspaper on the 13th] The five shipping companies of Yumin, Sanbei, Qianghua, Hezhong, and Ferry in Chongqing held a representative meeting at the Shipping Industry Association yesterday afternoon to respond to the Shanghai shipping industry's opposition to opening inland waterway navigation rights. They unanimously resolved to support the fight for sovereignty and telegraphed the Executive Yuan, saying: On the passive side, quickly withdraw the order allowing foreign ships to load and unload goods in the Yangtze River. On the active side, quickly find ways to solve the difficulties of the national shipping industry, or approve loans to purchase new ships to facilitate repatriation and transportation.</p>

<p>[Report from Nanjing by this newspaper on the 13th] It is reported that the National Defense Council and the Central Standing Committee had requested instructions from President Chiang on the end of the Supreme National Defense Council. Yesterday, they received the instruction to "postpone the handling." However, it is said that it will wait until the government is reorganized and the Central Political Conference is established before it ends, which shows that the central government still has great confidence in peace, unity, and unification.

The candidates for department directors will be selected from the original posts. Under the departments, there will be a total of approximately 70 sections. The regional commands established by the former Aviation Committee will be abolished, and five military control headquarters will be established in Kunming, Chengdu, Xi'an, Hankou, and Guangzhou.</p>
<p>[Report from Nanjing by this newspaper on the 13th] It is expected that it will take until the end of next month for the Political Department of the Military Commission to be completely closed. Apart from the officers who have been approved to be dismissed and return to their hometowns or change careers, the remaining personnel have been transferred to work in the Information Bureau of the Ministry of National Defense. The political departments of various military divisions have also been ordered to reorganize into information offices directly under the Information Bureau of the Ministry of National Defense.</p>

<p>[Report from Suzhou by this newspaper on the 13th] The Suzhou Higher Court believes that the spirit of the rule of law should be cultivated from lower-level cadres. Because prison guards generally lack education, they often use their powers to commit various acts of dereliction of duty. Although the impact is minor, it should be closely monitored and eliminated as it undermines the integrity and ethics of the rule of law. Therefore, a detention guard training institute has been established in the No. 3 Prison of Suzhou. The number of students in the first session is tentatively set at 50. For the time being, there will be no enrollment examination. Trainees will be selected from the active-duty guards by the higher and lower courts. The subjects are divided into military training, the Three Principles of the People, the Criminal Procedure Law, the Criminal Law, the Prison Regulations, the Detention Center Regulations, the Prison Execution Law, official document formats, the detention guard service regulations, and spiritual lectures. Chen Songnian, the warden, has been appointed by the Higher Court as the director of the institute.</p>

<p>[Dispatch from Nanjing by Agence France-Presse on the 12th] The newly appointed Minister of Economic Affairs, Wang Yunwu, recently gave an exclusive interview to a reporter from this agency, saying: "I want to summon forty industrialists and labor representatives to come to Nanjing for a meeting, in order to arouse attention to the necessity of China's industrialization. Regarding this matter, the plan I have drafted is not yet mature and I cannot discuss it in detail, but I hope that industry and agriculture will advance at the same time. China's current economic difficulties can be half solved by peaceful restoration. Increasing production has become the most serious and important issue, but before discussing increasing production, we must first solve the labor problem. I do not believe that continuing to raise wages and that labor and capital should share profits equally are practical solutions. Currently, wages have reached a level that prevents production from having a good start. If they are raised again, the consequences will be unimaginable. On the contrary, we deeply hope that labor and capital will cooperate closely. For labor-capital disputes, we intend to implement mediation and compulsory arbitration, but we do not want to promote a policy of state intervention. Instead, we want to prevent strikes and labor agitation in a fair and impartial manner. The government has not enforced existing laws regarding labor-capital disputes, which is regrettable. It is also necessary to invest in production to prevent speculation. Regarding the development of agriculture and industry, we plan to develop wasteland and improve water conservancy. All methods have long been condensed, but they have not been implemented due to the war. In the future, we hope to increase food production in a short period of time to eliminate the current food shortage. We need long-term efforts, but we firmly believe that we can overcome all difficulties. UNRRA is currently making large-scale efforts and cooperating with the Chinese authorities. The Executive Yuan has also saved tens of thousands of lives, but transportation difficulties often cause us problems. I want to use existing transportation tools to the extent possible and cooperate with the Ministry of Communications to do my best to help millions of innocent victims. This work is extremely difficult, and we are facing many major difficulties."</p>

<h3 id="e31">Over a Thousand Tea Farmers in Suzhou Petition for Exemption from Special Tax <a href="#e31" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c31" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">31</a></h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Suzhou Correspondent] After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, local governments at all levels resumed operations. However, due to the extreme shortage of central government funding allocations, the salaries of public servants, educators, police, and security personnel could not be increased, severely affecting administrative efficiency. Considering the excessive depletion of local finances, the Jiangsu Provincial Government believed that finding new sources of revenue was essential to mitigate the crisis of administrative collapse. It approved the implementation of taxes tailored to local conditions by subordinate counties. Upon receiving this order, the Wu County Government planned to levy special taxes on tea and flowers used in medicine. These plans were passed by the Provisional Assembly and are currently being submitted to the province for approval. However, the production of tea flowers in Suzhou is extremely minimal, limited to the Tiger Hill area. Over a thousand flower farmers have relied on this occupation for generations. The imposition of a special tax would inevitably threaten their livelihoods. Previously, they appealed to the public through newspapers, arguing that tea flowers should be treated as an agricultural product and exempted from taxation. When the Provincial Provisional Assembly opened, they even sent five representatives to the meeting to request an exemption, which was initially granted. They were asked to raise it to the Provincial Government for consideration. Now, the county government has sent personnel to the Tiger Hill area to investigate the production of tea flowers, causing considerable anxiety among the flower farmers. On the morning of the 12th, around a thousand of them gathered and marched into the city to petition the Provisional Assembly, the county party headquarters, and the county government. The head of the County Social Affairs Section, Lu Shaofen, received the flower farmer representatives, who stated their concerns. They argued that the government was already imposing burdens through the procurement of military grain, income tax, and business tax. Adding a special tax would not only be redundant and burdensome but would also drive the flower farmers to bankruptcy. They implored for an exemption. They proposed that if the government's finances were truly depleted and this measure was necessary, the thousand-plus flower farmers would be willing to contribute all their wealth voluntarily, but they were unwilling to be subject to a special tax. Section Chief Lu promised to discuss the matter with the county magistrate within three days and provide a response. During these three days, they were granted the freedom to buy and sell without paying taxes. The flower farmers then dispersed and returned.</p>

<h3 id="e32">Editorial: After the Conclusion of the Finance and Grain Conference <a href="#e32" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c32" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">32</a></h3>
<p>The Finance and Food Ministries convened the Finance and Grain Conference in Nanjing on the 6th of this month to discuss methods for reforming the financial revenue and expenditure system and adjusting the revenue and expenditure budgets of provinces, cities, and counties. It concluded on the 10th. The revised methods agreed upon will be implemented from July 1st. This is of great significance to the national economy and the people's livelihood, especially given the severe financial deficits and the serious grain shortages in various provinces. During this conference, more than a hundred proposals were put forward by various parties regarding the four issues of land tax, grain, taxation, and budgeting. All participants engaged in the most enthusiastic debate and discussion. The most noteworthy issues were: one, the extension of the method of land tax collection in kind for another year; and two, the adjustment of the financial revenue and expenditure budgets of various provinces, cities, and counties. Although the conference decided on implementation methods for these two issues, further clarification is still necessary.</p>
<p>The current financial revenue and expenditure system was decided upon at the National Finance Conference in June of the 30th year of the Republic (1941). At that time, China was engaged in a desperate battle against the Japanese invaders and urgently needed to centralize financial resources and control materials to win victory. Therefore, it was decided to implement the method of land tax collection in kind and reform the financial revenue and expenditure system, dividing national finance into two systems: national finance and local finance, and abolishing provincial-level finance. The original intention of the legislation at the time was, on the one hand, to increase national treasury revenue, and on the other hand, to enrich county-level tax sources in order to promote the new county system and implement local autonomy. However, in practice, although the land tax, which accounted for more than 70 percent of local taxes, was directly collected by the central government, the central government was still unable to make ends meet. Local governments, on the other hand, were unable to undertake various tasks that should have been done, such as clearing up household registration, reorganizing the Baojia system, and surveying land. By August of last year, the Anti-Japanese War had ended victoriously, and national reconstruction was rapidly unfolding. The implementation of constitutional governance was not far off, and local self-government needed to be accelerated. Therefore, China's wartime financial revenue and expenditure system was outdated and needed to be revised immediately. The restoration of provincial-level finance was almost imminent. In March of this year, the Second Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee was held in Chongqing and decided to amend the current financial revenue and expenditure system in order to achieve balanced development of central and local finances. Principles were also drafted and handed over to the government for implementation. The Finance and Food Ministries, recognizing that the 35th fiscal year was rapidly approaching, convened this conference to discuss implementation methods.</p>
<p>Regarding provincial finance, since the provinces began receiving and carrying out restoration work in August of last year, they have encountered major difficulties. On the one hand, the provincial governments needed a great deal of funding, while the central government subsidies were limited and could not be issued on time. On the other hand, the provincial governments were limited by laws and had no room to plan for funding. As a result, the finances of various provinces were in deficit, government affairs could not be promoted, financial management had no solutions, and everything became empty talk, which is the so-called "a clever wife cannot cook without rice." This time, the reform of the financial revenue and expenditure system restored the previous three-level system and stipulated that 30% of the land tax collected in kind would go to the central government, 20% to the provinces, and 50% to the local governments. Financial experts estimate that even with this allocation, provincial finances will still be difficult to maintain, and the representatives of various provinces have also recounted their difficulties. In particular, poor provinces will still find it difficult to balance their income and expenditure under the new system and will have to find ways to make up for it. Therefore, three more measures were decided: (1) Each province and city should prepare a revenue and expenditure comparison table and submit it to the central government for the allocation of subsidies; (2) The expenses for staff salaries should be managed from the surplus revenue from the sale of goods in kind; (3) Remote provinces and unrecovered areas should request special subsidies from the central government for necessary operational expenses. In this way, provincial finances may be solved in part, but given the central government's own severe financial deficits, provincial finances cannot yet be considered to have a solution.</p>
<p>Speaking of the method of collecting land tax in kind, it has been in effect for a full five years since July of the 30th year of the Republic (1941). Although corruption was unavoidable during this time, it was ultimately a major achievement in the history of China's grain administration. It not only solved the most serious military grain problem during China's War of Resistance but also stabilized prices and at least stabilized the lives of civil servants and educators through government grain control. But in practice, because the implementation methods were difficult to perfect, collectors easily manipulated them, and transportation and storage were cumbersome, public revenue was limited, and the burden on the people was not light. In addition, the weight of rice varied greatly depending on whether it was dry or wet, and rice was easily mixed with impurities, resulting in significant differences in quality. Rice could not be stored for long and rotted and deteriorated without any standards. After several transfers, it often deteriorated and fell short in quantity. And the general collection personnel often stole from the sky and changed the day, gradually transferring the nation's public grain into their private pockets. This phenomenon was almost unavoidable to some extent in every province and county. The suicides of some grain officials may also have been due to past unreliable grain accounts. Wartime collection in kind was unavoidable, but now that the war is over, it is reasonable to abolish collection in kind. However, the government has still decided to extend the collection in kind method for another year, which must be due to its great difficulties. As President Chiang Kai-shek said: "The decision to extend the collection of land tax in kind for another year at this conference is necessary to complete the reconstruction work. However, local grain authorities should be especially mindful of the suffering of the people when collecting in kind, reduce collection procedures, and strictly prohibit harassment to facilitate the people." It is hoped that all local officials who attended the conference will repeatedly admonish their subordinates to implement the collection in kind after they return, always remembering that it is a last resort and never treating collection in kind as a convenient door for private gain.</p>
<p>Eighty percent of the Chinese people are farmers. During this War of Resistance, they supported the country's resistance with vast manpower and military grain, contributing more than ever before. But after the victory, looking at the rural areas across the country, not to mention the disaster areas, even in the most prosperous Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, and Jiangxi provinces, the rural areas have reached the brink of collapse. Now is the time to rest with the people! National officials should truly take responsibility, avoid suspicion and resentment, rectify the political climate, and no longer allow corrupt officials to impose exorbitant taxes on the countryside in the name of collection in kind, causing widespread complaints from the common people! Grain administration authorities should especially learn from the past, prevent problems before they occur, and eliminate all malpractices, so as not to betray the central government's painstaking efforts to extend collection in kind for another year.</p>

The proportion of major warships is as follows:</p>
<p>However, most U.S. warships will be dismantled or decommissioned. The famous ships that the authorities plan to retain are as follows:</p>
<p>Battleships: Four active, two reserve, ten decommissioned but available for service.</p>
<p>Cruisers: Twenty-nine active, ten reserve, thirty decommissioned.</p>
<p>Aircraft Carriers: Twelve active, three reserve, twenty-two decommissioned.</p>
<p>Escort Carriers: Ten active, fifty-six decommissioned, none in reserve.</p>
<p>Destroyers: One hundred and twenty-six active, twenty-two reserve, two hundred and five decommissioned.</p>
<p>Destroyer Escorts: Thirty active, four reserve, two hundred and four decommissioned.</p>
<p>Submarines: Twenty active, one hundred and six decommissioned.</p>
<p>The organization of the post-war fleet will generally follow the following method:</p>
<p>Pacific Fleet: Deploy amphibious forces suitable for transporting a Marine division for reinforcement, totaling seven aircraft carriers, six escort carriers, two battleships, seventeen cruisers, seventy-two destroyers, thirty-nine submarines, and sixteen destroyer escorts.</p>
<p>Atlantic Fleet: Equip with sufficient strength to reinforce a Marine division, totaling five aircraft carriers, four escort carriers, two battleships, eleven cruisers, forty-five destroyers, forty-one submarines, and fourteen destroyer escorts.</p>
<p>Each fleet should be accompanied by a naval air force, the size of which will depend on funding. A reserve fleet will be maintained in both the Atlantic and Pacific. This active and reserve fleet is the minimum standard of preparedness. Under the current international situation, it is appropriate. The post-war fleet plan, in terms of quality, will be equal to the entire world's fleet.</p>
<p>Hungarian Prime Minister Speaks in the U.S.: Ridicules the Theory of an "Iron Curtain" Obscuring Hungary; Defends Economic Cooperation with the Soviet Union</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, December 12th] Hungarian Prime Minister Nagy, accompanied by three cabinet members, arrived in the U.S. at the invitation of the U.S. government and stayed at the Blair House. Today, he met with reporters and ridiculed former British Prime Minister Churchill's claim that the Soviet Union used an "iron curtain" to obscure Hungary, preventing Western countries from approaching, saying, "If there were an iron curtain around Hungary, would I still be able to sit in this room and talk to you? In my capital, I spend most of my time receiving British and American journalists, which is located behind the so-called iron curtain." Regarding Hungary's signing of a five-year economic cooperation treaty with the Soviet Union to jointly develop basic industries, Nagy also defended it, saying, "In the months after Hungary's liberation, no country other than the Soviet Union was able to cooperate economically with it. Hungary suffered deeply from this war and is happy to have economic contact with any country."</p>

<p>[United Press, Bangkok, December 12th] Siamese Prime Minister Phanomyong announced tonight that he had formed a new government. The main figures in the new cabinet are Pridi Banomyong, leader of the Cooperation Party, as Minister of Industry, and Khuang Aphaiwong, leader of the Constitutional Party, as Minister of Justice.</p>
<p>[United Press, Bangkok, December 12th] The Siamese Police Department issued a detailed report today in response to rumors that the late King Ananda Mahidol committed suicide or was murdered, reiterating that the King's death was accidental. Based on various signs, such as the location of the wound and the weapon used, it proves to be an accident. It is said that the King was in high spirits on the day of his sudden death. However, others claimed that the King was in poor health and likely committed suicide, while some whispered that he was murdered. These rumors either blamed the death of the King on the revolutionary party that overthrew the former King or claimed that royalists did this out of fear that the king sympathized with democracy.</p>

<h3 id="e51">International Tribunal Continues Trial of Japanese War Criminals; Judges from Eleven Countries Attend; Prosecutors Present Evidence; The Crime of the Defendant Initiating War in Violation of Treaties is Clear <a href="#e51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, December 13th] The Far East International Tribunal continued its trial today. Australian prosecutor Mansfield, representing the prosecution, presented nearly a hundred kinds of historical documents and treaties to prove that the 28 defendants launched wars of aggression in the Far East in violation of treaties. The defense, through American statutory lawyer Matic, requested to reserve the right to rebut this evidence. The treaties presented by the prosecution traced back to the International Convention for the Pacific Settlement of International Disputes signed in The Hague on July 27, 1899, as well as other treaties signed and ratified by Japan; to prove that Japan disregarded basic international rules, arbitrarily implemented its colonial acquisition plan, and launched the Pacific War at Pearl Harbor without formally declaring war in accordance with the Hague Convention ratified by Japan in 1907. Judges from eleven countries attended together today for the first time. The new Philippine judge, Galanilla, sat alongside judges from China, the United States, Britain, the Soviet Union, France, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and India. The application of four defendants to submit the case to a jury composed of leaders of international religious and intellectual circles was rejected.</p>
<p>Large Maps Hang on Both Walls</p>
<p>In order to prove the defendants' conspiracy of aggression, the prosecution specially made thirteen large maps and hung them on both walls, indicating the route of Japan's invasion of land from 1931 until its surrender. The bright red markings on the maps proved the expansion of Japan's sphere of influence in Manchuria and China. After 1931, the maps were all painted scarlet. The defendants watched the unfolding of the maps with a very strange feeling. The defendants' lawyers objected to the presentation of the maps. Chief Judge Webb declared that the maps could be used as evidence. At this point, Tojo's defense lawyer, Ichiro, asked the court to pay attention to the erroneous boundary line of the Soviet Primorsky Krai, but the court ignored it. Deputy Prosecutor (Canada) Norren, dressed in military uniform, appeared in court for the first time and presented a lengthy statement of seventy-six pages on the organization of the Japanese state. The court adjourned temporarily at 12:15 p.m. and resumed at 1:50 p.m.</p>
<p>[Kaizo Sha, Tokyo, December 13th] The defendant's defense team, led by Hiroya Koki, argued that the army and navy "should not be tried separately," and the court rejected the defense.</p>

<p>[United Press, Tokyo, December 13th] Japanese police authorities arrested fifty "nightingales" last night. This is the third large-scale roundup since the Allied occupation of Japan. These street prostitutes were all arrested in front of Hibiya Park Imperial Palace, which is one of the most fashionable places for them to flirt with American soldiers. Except for a few who were sent to the hospital for sexually transmitted diseases, the rest were released after strict interrogation. The Mainichi Shimbun reported that due to the police's frequent visits, these nightingales had temporarily disappeared, but with "the arrival of summer, they have begun to show their faces again." The newspaper estimated that there are about 10,000 women who "disrupt public morals."</p>

<p>Establishment of "Fire Society" Plays Funeral Music; Drunken Brawls Ensue</p>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, December 13th] Some Japanese claiming to be advocates of art, music, literature, journalism, and political science organized the so-called "Fire Society" a month ago. At the founding meeting, they played the funeral march of the Rising Sun as a way to "bury old Japan." Recently, they held a dinner party, each paying 20 yen, preparing to peacefully discuss the association's affairs. At that time, it was decided to publish a quarterly magazine "Fire" to promote the Japanese literary renaissance and to host exhibitions, concerts, and dance performances. Suddenly, many beers, whiskeys, and genuine sake appeared from nowhere. The attendees were salivating and drank like cattle. When they became drunk, they inexplicably fought and wrestled together in at least ten incidents. There was even a poet of some faction, shaking his head and reciting his masterpiece, until the fight was enjoyable, several people were injured, and they dispersed in a rush.</p>

<p>[Our Own Correspondent] Since the authorities strictly prohibited speculation in the city's grain market, prices have trended downward. However, black market transactions were discovered again yesterday, and the market experienced slight fluctuations. Therefore, Mayor Wu personally went to the Qingyun Pavilion Rice Market at 10:30 AM yesterday to give instructions, saying: "I hope that all rice stores can adhere to their positions and consider the people's food. If rice stores do not have rice available, they can register with the Rice Trade Association and find a way to supply it, so that the city's food can be resolved reasonably." He left after about twenty minutes. In addition, the Bureau of Social Affairs strictly prohibits private transactions and does not allow brokers to enter the market. The authorities are investigating the average transaction figures of all firms over the past month in great detail. In addition to supplying the market's needs, they are not allowed to sell more, in order to prevent hoarding. For rice sold at retail stores, the firm must issue invoices to customers. If invoices are not issued, citizens can report it.</p>
<p>(Above) Mayor Wu Instructs Rice Merchants at the Rice Market (Below) Crowd at the Rice Market (Photo by Yu Chuang)</p>
<p>The city government attaches great importance to the smooth flow of grain sources. It has telegraphed the Ministry of Food and the Jiangsu Provincial Government to request the suppression of price increases in rice-producing areas and to facilitate Shanghai rice merchants in purchasing grain from producing areas. The amount of rice currently registered in the city is 500,000 dan. The daily market demand is about 7,600 dan. In terms of the total amount of rice in storage, it is sufficient for two months. Rice from domestic producing areas arrives daily in the amount of about 4,000 to 10,000 dan. Moreover, foreign rice can be shipped in steadily. There is no need to worry about the source of rice.</p>
<h3 id="e56">Secret Transactions Still Occur Outside the Market <a href="#e56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>[Another Report] Recently, due to the unwillingness of rice stores to release goods and the inability of rice firms to wholesale, there have been very few transactions in the rice market. Many of the transactions are for substandard goods, and black market transactions are conducted at high prices. Yesterday morning, our reporter made a tour of the Qingyun Pavilion Rice Market and happened to witness Mayor Wu inspecting the area and giving instructions.</p>
<p>Transactions in the market yesterday were still scarce. Those with goods were still taking a wait-and-see attitude, and those offering goods were mostly substandard. Our reporter witnessed 300 shi of indica rice being sold for 46,400 yuan each. Good goods are still traded secretly outside the market.</p>
<p>After Mayor Wu's visit and instructions, the general reaction was very good. People discussed it one after another, saying that many people would sell tomorrow. A rice firm owner complained: "Having been in the rice business until today, I have never seen such a dead end. Rice firms have nowhere to buy rice. If we buy at a high price, we cannot bear the losses. We have already survived the eight years of the War of Resistance, why can't we survive the coming February? After the new grain comes on the market, the situation will improve. For the time being, we will let the speculators fall into the net of the law by themselves, and don't be misled."</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Zhang Songtao, the former puppet Jiangsu Provincial Police Commissioner, was retried in the High Court yesterday afternoon. According to his testimony: his assets in the Yangtze Hotel amounted to only 5,000 shares, each worth 100 yuan. During his tenure as a puppet commissioner, he rescued underground workers Xu Chongzhi and Yang Hui in the 28th year [of the Republic of China]. In the 29th year, he was arrested by puppet secret agents and was bailed out by Chen Qun and Ren Yuandao, but he was not allowed to leave Shanghai. His relationship with Chen Qun was that of a friend. His appointment as puppet commissioner was due to Chen's recommendation, and he was appointed by the Police Department of the puppet Jiangsu Provincial Government as a puppet official. During his tenure, he only handled theft cases and maintained law and order. Political matters were handled by the "Political Security Bureau". All opium dens were under the jurisdiction of the Anti-Smoking Bureau, which had nothing to do with him, and so on. The case will be sentenced at 2:30 PM on the 20th of this month. The case of Ma Suiliang, a former clerk of the 3rd Section of the puppet Investigation and Statistics Department, will also be sentenced on the same day.</p>
<p>[Additional News] Wu Liande, the former owner of Liangyou Pictorial, was sentenced to seven years of imprisonment by the High Court for participating in the puppet government and serving as the director of the Hangzhou district of the puppet Incense and Candle Tax Bureau. Wu was dissatisfied, and his wife, Liu Yansong, claimed, "Zhang Haoran, the director-general of the puppet Incense and Candle Tax Bureau in Shanghai, was only sentenced to five years. Wu Liande was just a small district director, yet he was sentenced to seven years. It's really unfair." She applied for a retrial, which has been approved. When the trial opened yesterday morning, Judge Qiu inquired in detail about his surrender to General Mao Sen, the Southeast Special Commissioner of the Military Statistics Bureau, providing secret information about the enemy, and covering up underground work. The case was then adjourned for further hearing. The cases of Yang Tao, the former magistrate of Qingpu County; Chen Wanli, the former deputy chief of the Special High Section of the puppet Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau; and Lu Xiangquan, the former head of the Intelligence Unit of the puppet Xinchang County Garrison in Zhejiang, were also examined and adjourned for further hearing.

<h3 id="e69">Former Vice Minister of Propaganda and Editor-in-Chief of Ta Kung Weekly, Zhang Ke, Appeals for Leniency, Claims to Have Protected the Central Government and Criticized the Enemy with Dauntless Spirit: "Using Speech to Show Loyalty and Make Amends"? <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] In the late spring of last year, just as the US Navy was approaching the Japanese mainland and the "rising sun" was about to set, a publication that was popular in the occupied areas appeared in the Nanjing-Shanghai area. Its name was "Ta Kung". Calling on the Japanese army to withdraw troops was in line with the wishes of the myopic public. However, "Ta Kung" was, after all, a propaganda publication of the puppet regime, so its organizer, Zhang Ke (former Vice Minister of Propaganda of the puppet regime), was finally arrested and imprisoned, to be punished by the national law.</p>
<p>Zhang is from Hangzhou, is 43 years old, graduated from the Department of Political Economy of Yenching University, studied at the University of Berlin in Germany, and obtained a master's degree in Political Economy and Municipal Administration from Columbia University in the United States. After returning to China, he served as the personal secretary of Foreign Minister Chen Youren and accompanied Chen to Moscow, Berlin, and other places. Later, he served as a professor at Yenching, Zhongshan, and other universities for more than ten years. After the war, he retreated west with the government and served as a political instructor in the Youth Cadre Training Corps. Later, at Chen's invitation, he went to Hong Kong to work as his personal assistant and taught at the Ministry of Finance's Taxation College. When the Pacific War broke out and Hong Kong fell, Zhang and Chen were captured together. After arriving in Shanghai, Chen died of illness in the summer of the 31st year [of the Republic of China]. Zhang then went to Nanjing and, at the invitation of Lin Baisheng, the puppet Minister of Propaganda, took office as the Deputy Minister of Propaganda. Later, due to the unsuccessful suggestion to convene a representative conference of the people in the occupied areas, he resigned in November of the same year and secretly agreed with the enemy "Ambassador" Taniguchi's "Secretary" Shimizu on two principles: (1) To use democratic unity to save the country as a slogan, to approach other parties, to disperse the strength of the resistance, in order to implement the enemy's divisive policy. (2) To be allowed to publish requests for Japan to withdraw its troops stationed in China, so that the enemy could transfer some of its elite troops back to the country to defend its homeland. In April of the 34th year [of the Republic of China], the "Ta Kung Weekly" was published in Shanghai, advocating the aforementioned suggestions and promoting "Sino-Japanese peace" and opposing the Allied forces fighting in China. It was published for thirteen issues and was discontinued in July of the 34th year due to various reasons. After the victory, he was arrested by the Military Statistics Bureau and transferred to the High Procuratorate for investigation, and was prosecuted according to law.</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, Judge Qiu opened the trial. The defendant's lawyer, Yan Hongshihao, acted as his defender. Zhang wore a gray suit and yellow leather shoes, and his hair was neatly combed, possessing a rather "scholarly demeanor". According to his statement, after being captured, he was escorted to Shanghai and, based on a citizen's stance, refused any enticements or threats. In June of the 33rd year [of the Republic of China], due to his classmate relationship with Lin Baisheng, the puppet Minister of Propaganda, they often visited each other and frequently worried about the situation in the southeast. Therefore, he advocated abolishing the puppet government, returning power to the central government, and forming a committee to relieve the people in the occupied areas. This proposal was approved by Chen Gongbo and Lin Baisheng, and Zeng Qi of the Youth Party was present at the time, saying that he would take this suggestion to Chongqing with his status as a senator for discussion. Lin then invited Zhang to join the puppet government to jointly implement his proposals, and he agreed. However, after taking office, Lin did nothing about the agreed points, and the defendant was unable to do anything alone. Therefore, he decided to resign and use the convenience of his puppet position to obtain a registration certificate and publish the Ta Kung Weekly, in order to implement the central government's plan to return power and provide relief to the people, which he was unable to implement during his tenure as a puppet official. During his five months in "office", he never participated in promoting the puppet government or promoting peace movements, and he did not collude with the enemy or plot to resist his own country. The defendant should be subject to national law, but he hopes for leniency. As for the publication of the Ta Kung Weekly, he argued that "he used a dauntless spirit to protect the central government, criticize the crimes of the enemy and puppet regime, and promote the achievements of the Allied countries, put forward the people's spirit and the belief in the victory of the resistance war, and used speech to show loyalty and make amends, which shows the defendant's heart." After Judge Qiu inquired in detail, the case was adjourned for further hearing.</p>
<h3 id="e70">Glass Age, Glass Mania: Glass Belts, Glass Shoes, All Kinds of Goods in Glass Cabinets <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>Some people regard the current Shanghai as the "Glass Age". Almost everyone has a glass belt, and glass shoes are also slowly becoming popular. If you want cheap glass belts, you can buy them from roadside stalls. These stalls are now adding a lot of vitality to the roads. The most concentrated areas are in the vicinity of Lloyd Road and Xinzha Road near the New World. Their small cabinets are filled with all kinds of goods, both food and daily necessities. Some are even domestic goods, but they are labeled as American goods, so the "American obsessed" are flocking to them.</p>
<p>Recently, there was a commotion in their small circle. American military police (MP) and shore patrol (SP) have confiscated goods from several stalls more than once. The evening newspaper even reported a few days ago that American military police had arrested street vendors. According to reporters, these stalls are nominally selling US military supplies, but military supplies account for only two or three out of ten. Although they sell Malboro cigarettes and glass belts, they have all paid taxes. They even sell domestic goods, such as Maocheng sunglasses, milk powder, and Indian poplin. The Indian poplin is mostly purchased from the Sisters Flower, Bing Daxiang, and other cloth stores, and they have invoices as proof. The vendors often come to the newspaper to complain about the confiscation of their goods. It is said that some SPs often take Maocheng glasses, hide canned cigarettes, and leave without asking questions. Because the incidents happened suddenly, the vendors were in a panic and did not have time to identify the license plate numbers of the SP patrol vehicles. When they went to the Military Police Headquarters, they could not find out anything. Therefore, a question arises here: if the military supplies have been confiscated, where can they ask for the return of the legal goods? There are about 10,000 street vendors in Shanghai. Most of them borrowed capital from usurers to set up stalls. The larger capital is around one million, and the smallest is between two or three hundred thousand. Therefore, once the goods are confiscated, the losses are very huge. They believe that the main reason for their grievances is that military supplies actually account for a very small percentage of the confiscated goods. Most of them are domestic goods or American goods that have already been taxed. Moreover, whenever they go to the US Military Police Headquarters to inquire, no one can give them a responsible answer. As for the very small portion of military supplies in all their goods, they are also wholesaled by the scalpers in the central market and are not directly received as stolen goods. In addition, some of the American goods circulating on the market are also sold by American soldiers themselves, but they do not want Chinese legal tender. It is estimated that the total consumption of American soldiers in Shanghai is about one to two million US dollars per month. They use goods to collect US dollar bills back, which is a very large loss in our country's foreign exchange. The act of American soldiers selling goods to recover US dollars may have been tacitly approved by their superiors.</p>
<p>Regarding whether American military police can directly confiscate the goods of Chinese street vendors in Shanghai, or even whether they can directly arrest Chinese street vendors, there seems to be a question. To this end, the reporter visited the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs the day before yesterday afternoon. According to the office, they were not aware of such things happening and believed that if American military police did arrest our country's street vendors, the inside story would not be as simple as we think. However, if the actions of the American military police are really illegal and infringe upon our country's sovereignty, the government will of course file a protest in accordance with the law.

<p>After the resolution of various labor disputes in the city, employers often use increased expenses as an excuse to implement price increases to compensate. Therefore, the ultimate burden is still added to the citizens, which is enough to stimulate other prices and cause a general increase. Yesterday (the 13th), labor and management in the garment industry reached an agreement. The labor dispute in the industry, which had been going on for many days, was resolved after the efforts of representatives from both sides to mediate. Starting yesterday, the original wages will be adjusted. (The current labor cost for making a single long gown is now 17,000 yuan per piece, and a single cheongsam is 11,000 yuan.)</p>
<p>After the American Gui Tou Pai DDT Insecticide Company sprayed our newspaper's dormitory free of charge a few days ago, bedbugs disappeared at night, and sleep was undisturbed. It is said that the company's DDT spraying is completely service-oriented. If public places entrust them to spray, they will not charge a fee, only slightly collect the cost of the chemicals. The above picture shows the spraying service situation of our newspaper.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Yesterday, the Special Criminal Court of the High Court sentenced three cases of traitors: (1) Yang Yirong, an informant of the enemy Military Police Team in Taixing, colluded with the enemy and served in relevant military positions. He was sentenced to two and a half years of imprisonment and deprived of public rights for two years. (2) Jin Hui, the director of the Nanjing Reformation Institute of the puppet Special Agent Headquarters, colluded with the enemy and plotted to resist his own country. He was sentenced to six years of imprisonment and deprived of public rights for six years. (3) Tie Po'er and Tie Jiaxing, two translators of the enemy Naval Department, jointly colluded with the enemy and plotted to resist our country. Each was sentenced to two years and six months of imprisonment and deprived of public rights for two years. All the property of the above criminals, except for the necessary living expenses for their families, will be confiscated.</p>
<h3 id="e73">Japanese War Criminal Yuasa Torakichi Embezzled Prisoner Rations and Abused and Killed Prisoners; Trial Concluded, Sentencing Scheduled <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Yesterday afternoon, the Military Tribunal continued to try Yuasa Torakichi, the former manager of the enemy's Shanghai prisoner-of-war camp. Yuasa's charges are embezzlement of prisoner rations and abuse and killing of prisoners. Yesterday, Ouyang Chen, a quartermaster of the Special Affairs Regiment of the Garrison Headquarters, testified in court. According to him: prisoners of war were often hungry and could not eat, but they were forced to do hard labor every day. If they were slightly disobedient, they would be whipped by Yuasa, resulting in the death of many people. Yuasa claimed: he was not a soldier, but only a labor manager. He did beat prisoners of war, but he did not know that it would lead to death. The killing was the responsibility of the team leader, Hanashima, and the prisoner rations were also not managed by him. Yuasa is short in stature and wears a coarse cloth Chinese-style gown, looking quite dull. The pro bono lawyer, Jiang Weiping, defended the defendant, saying that the prisoner rations were not managed by Yuasa, and there was no definite evidence of killing. However, the defendant admitted to whipping prisoners of war, so he was only guilty of the crime of injury under the criminal law. The court concluded the investigation and trial and scheduled the sentencing for 11:00 AM on the 17th of this month.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The Yongyu Securities Company at No. 322 Jiujiang Road, Securities Building, was holding a card game gathering with huge stakes.

<h3 id="e76">The City's Tax Revenue is Severely Insufficient; Efforts to Reduce Unnecessary Expenditures; Mr. Gu Chunfan Talks to Reporters Yesterday; No Increase in Any Taxes is Currently Planned <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Gu Chunfan, Director of the Finance Bureau, attended the National Fiscal Revenue and Expenditure System Conference in Beijing last week and has completed his work and returned to Shanghai the day before yesterday evening. Yesterday afternoon, Director Gu received a reporter from our newspaper and stated: The main resolution of this meeting is to revise the division of national and local taxes, which will be implemented from July 1st. The entire deed tax will be assigned to the local government, and the land tax will be collected by the local government, of which 60% will go to the local government. The inheritance tax will be collected by the central government, of which 15% will be assigned to the local government. The business tax will be collected directly by the central government, of which 70% will be allocated back to the local government.</p>
<p>In the past, the city's fiscal revenue and expenditure were severely insufficient. After the Executive Yuan subsidized a part of it, it could still be made up. However, starting from July, the Executive Yuan stipulated that it would no longer provide subsidies, and all funds would be raised locally, that is, from business, land, and deed taxes, etc., to increase revenue. However, it is currently unknown whether the amount of business tax collected will be sufficient to cover the subsidies. Furthermore, since the Executive Yuan approved the adjustment of salaries for civil servants and teachers in June, the deficit will be even greater. The central government only promised to be responsible for the national portion and subsidize 500 million yuan per month. Gu stated that the only way to deal with the emergency is to address the urgent needs first and delay the less urgent ones, and to reduce unnecessary expenditures as much as possible. In addition, the management of tax revenue will also be strictly enforced to prevent tax evasion. He also hopes that citizens will cooperate and report as much as possible. After verification, strict penalties will be imposed. Currently, no increase in any taxes is planned to avoid increasing the burden on the people. As for adjusting housing donations, it is temporarily not easy to implement, but a plan is being drafted.</p>
<p>Regarding the issuance of public bonds, Director Gu believes that there is no guarantee of purchasing power and does not plan to hold it. The public bonds issued by the former Municipal Council have not yet been fully cleared due to the council's busy affairs.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Xu Yulong, a vegetable vendor from the Central Market, lives on the third floor of No. 27 Jinling Road, Shunji Hat and Shoe Store. Two months ago, Xu's seven-year-old daughter, Meili, was tricked out by his brother-in-law, Li Afu, and there has been no news of her since. Unexpectedly, yesterday afternoon at about 1:00 PM, Li and a police officer (No. 1459) went to Xu's residence, falsely accusing Xu of stealing a bicycle and insisting on taking Xu away. A conflict arose between the two parties. At that time, Xu closed the door, which angered the police officer, who drew his gun and fired two shots to intimidate. Li took the opportunity to escape. As a result, the police officer was about to take Xu into the Huangpu Sub-bureau. Just as he went out the back door, in the back alley of Jianli Lane, for some unknown reason, the police officer fired another shot in the lane. A stray bullet hit Zhang Qingyuan, an apprentice at the Tongli Department Store, in the nose. The store owner reported the incident to the Huangpu Sub-bureau. After a preliminary investigation by Director Du, he believed that the police officer's arbitrary firing of a gun was inappropriate and ordered the police officer who caused the incident to be detained to investigate the case and handle it accordingly.</p>

Zhang reported this information to the Hongkou Police Station. The branch office investigated and discovered that Dong Qinchang, a former apprentice at Dahe, was suspected. He is currently a teacher at Jingyuan Elementary School at No. 100, Lane 649, Dongda Road. On the 9th, police officers were dispatched to arrest him.

<h3 id="e86">Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau Utilizes Summer Vacation to Train Large Numbers of Elementary School Teachers, Improving Teacher Quality and Increasing Teaching Efficiency <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau will utilize the summer vacation to train a large number of elementary school teachers in the city, to study academics and strengthen their physique, thereby increasing teaching efficiency and actively promoting national education. Also, to help the unqualified elementary school teachers of this session, three training programs will be held starting in July. Here are the details of each program:</p>
<p>Cadre Summer Camp</p>
<p>(A) Shanghai Municipal National Education Cadre Summer Camp: The purpose of the camp's training is to: (1) Train national education cadres in the city in stages, so that they clearly understand the educational purpose of the Republic of China and the steps to implement national education, so as to become excellent cadres engaged in national education. (2) Train national education personnel in the city in stages, so that they acquire knowledge of constitutional construction and local autonomy, so as to become the backbone of local autonomy. This session's trainees are principals, directors, and cultural section directors of district public offices. The number of trainees is limited to 200. The training period is from July 29th to August 10th. The camp is located at the Central National School in Gaoqiao District, near the seaside with pleasant scenery, and lodging is available for trainees.

<p>[Local News] The first meeting of the Shanghai Middle School Student Qualification Screening Committee was held in the Education Bureau conference room at 4:00 PM yesterday.

Those who were admitted to national or registered universities before February 35 can be exempted from part or all of the examination based on their university study grades. (3) Qualification screening for graduates of secondary schools established by the puppet regime should be registered first, submit academic credentials, and submit a report on reading the Three People's Principles, and must participate in the examination. However, those who were admitted to national or registered universities and studied there before February 35 can be exempted from part or all of the examination based on their university study grades.

<h3 id="e94">Elementary School Curriculum Research: A Reasonable Path for Elementary School Curriculum Standards <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>Revising the elementary school curriculum has become the focus of attention in all aspects. Elementary school education is the starting point of education and the foundation of knowledge for every future citizen; with a sound elementary school education and knowledge base, one can receive advanced knowledge and create an excellent citizen.</p>
<p>In the past, people generally neglected elementary school education, considering the sacred and important elementary school education to be insignificant. Now this wrong concept has been gradually corrected, and everyone recognizes the importance of elementary school education. It is the cradle of knowledge for every citizen and the nanny who instills basic education in children.</p>
<p>Our country's education has never had reasonable standards, especially elementary school. Each school sets its own curriculum, which varies widely in content and difficulty. Students in the same grade have different levels of proficiency due to the different schools they attend. If this continues, the academic abilities of students in middle school and university will never be equal, and no definite standard can be found. Therefore, revising the elementary school curriculum standards is a matter of great urgency.</p>
<p>But what is the standard for the elementary school curriculum? The relationship is too great and should be decided after careful research in all aspects. The scope of this research is quite extensive. I believe that a detailed analysis and observation of children's physical strength, intelligence, psychology, experience, and the knowledge they actually need to gain in the six years of elementary school must be carried out before a concrete decision can be made and implemented.</p>
<p>Nowadays, the age of admission for most children is earlier than in the past, averaging around six years old. The earliest is five years old in Chinese age at admission, so the age is young, like a tender seedling just sprouting from a branch, and the intelligence is naturally very weak. The curriculum at this time must be simplified as much as possible. I believe that the responsibility of educating children in the first and second grades of elementary school only needs to achieve the following points: (1) To enlighten children's thoughts, from scattered to concentrated. (2) To arouse children's desire for knowledge and interest in the curriculum. (3) To make children know the most basic common sense, counting, and etiquette.</p>
<p>When children's thoughts are concentrated, the foundation is solid, and they gradually become interested in the education they receive, then increase and deepen the subjects reasonably step by step from the third grade. However, this increase and deepening must be suitable for children's physical strength and intelligence so that they can accept and digest it without causing adverse reactions such as malnutrition.</p>
<p>I am not from the Department of Education, nor am I an expert in researching educational issues, but I feel the seriousness of this issue and the adverse consequences caused by unreasonable courses in the past. I think that there are thousands of future citizens groaning under the lash of this unreasonable curriculum, waiting to be rescued. I am also a member of the people, and my children will grow up and be sent to school for education. I cannot watch this curriculum standard remain unreasonable forever without reforming it. I have written this article based on my limited views for the reference of those responsible for revising the elementary school curriculum standards. (Gao Wuhong, 35, 6, 11, in Wuxi)</p>

<h3 id="e98">Today's Big Football Match: Visiting Team Faces Formidable Opponent - Star Eastern League to Face Eastern China - 5:30 PM at Recreation Ground - Whether it Can Proceed Depends on the Weather <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>The Hong Kong Star Eastern Football League team, on a tour to Shanghai, has achieved victories in all three matches, successively defeating foreign teams such as the British Navy, Western League, and Jewish team. Today, in their fourth match, they will face their first formidable opponent. They will battle Eastern China at the Recreation Ground at 5:30 PM. Tickets remain the same price and will be available for sale starting at 3:00 PM at 303 South Shaanxi Road. The referee is Deng Xiaoliang, and the linesmen are He Chunhui and Huang Renyi.</p>
<p>Lineups of Both Sides</p>
<p>Regarding the lineup for Star Eastern today, arranged by Xu Jingcheng, Guo Yingqi and Feng Shengkun will temporarily take a short rest. The left wing belongs to Li Shuoyou, Liu Songsheng will temporarily fill the right forward position, and the rest remain unchanged. The visiting team risked trying a new formation the other day, almost falling victim to the Jewish team. Therefore, today they have decided to fight with a reasonable formation. Shuoyou's performance lately has been strong, and he should be able to handle this position happily. Songsheng's guest appearance as a forward should also not be disappointing.</p>
<p>The lineup for Eastern China has also been announced. Goalkeeper Zhang Banglun is in good condition, firmly guarding his position. Ling Sheng shifts to left inside forward, with Tian Zheng Yingquan taking over as right forward. Fu Zhen and Long Bo in the center back line appear quite strong. In the five-forward formation, A-Sun on the right is doubtful, with Ling Sheng replacing the left, which is also ideal. With such a formation, the defense is solid, and the forwards are sharp. Moreover, A-Sun's footwork is experienced and skillful, shooting left and right as he pleases. Assisted by Ling Sheng, they will pose a serious threat to the visiting team.</p>
<p>Furthermore, according to the Football Committee: due to yesterday's heavy rain, whether the field can be used for the match today, please call 70099 at the Municipal Stadium to inquire. If the match cannot be played today, it will be postponed to the next day.</p>

<p>Today's Outcome</p>
<p>Today, the Star Eastern League team will play against the strong Eastern China team in this city. Opinions on the outcome vary. Some say Star Eastern will definitely win, while others say Eastern China also has a chance. Those who say Star Eastern will definitely win base their judgment on Star Eastern's three consecutive victories and their performance on the field, their crisp footwork, and their skilled teamwork. Those who favor Star Eastern's victory represent the majority. Looking at the lineup arranged for Eastern China today, it is still considered well-organized. Veteran generals and elite troops are also not weak, and the outcome will depend on luck. Each will fight for their reputation, making a great battle certain.</p>
<p>Tour to Australia</p>
<p>Regarding the Star Eastern League team's tour to Australia, according to team leader Fan Jiping, Hu Hao in Hong Kong has already made the necessary arrangements and paid a deposit of 5,000 Australian pounds, approximately equivalent to 70,000 Hong Kong dollars, to the Australian Football Association. After the matches in Shanghai, they will set off for Australia. It is hoped that the team will promote their prestige overseas, given their performance in Shanghai.</p>

<p>Mayor Wu Personally Speaks at the Market - Transaction Prices Must Be Based on the Previous Day</p>
<p>Mayor Wu personally went to the rice market yesterday morning to give an important speech to the rice merchants, roughly stating: (1) Resolutely crack down on rice merchants who collude to speculate and hoard rice. Market transaction prices should be based on the market prices of the previous day and should not be raised. The city currently needs more than 7,000 dan of rice per day. If the goods do not arrive in sufficient quantity, registered rice merchants will be allowed to supplement them. (2) Rice shops are allowed to purchase from the market according to the actual amount of rice they sell, but they are not allowed to purchase more to prevent hoarding. In terms of price, they are allowed to add a 6% profit margin and transportation costs to the purchase price from the market, and no additional charges are allowed. In addition, an invoice must be provided when selling.</p>
<p>The rice market opened with increased volume yesterday, and most legitimate rice merchants were able to follow the authorities' instructions and trade normally. However, black-hearted speculative profiteers are still operating secretly, so the registration of goods at the market has decreased. Yesterday, the original inventory of goods in each stall did not change, but 100 yuan fell by 500 yuan. Yesterday's registration of goods was only 2,877 shi, including 903 shi of white japonica rice, 564 shi of thin indica rice, 340 shi of sheep glutinous rice, 71 shi of Du indica rice, and 999 shi of weed indica rice. Flour rose early and fell in the afternoon, eventually closing weakly. Corn remained scarce, the red grain market was sluggish, the new wheat from Ningbo was moving but not booming, and the trend was firm. The turnover of old wheat was average, and prices were fair. Soybeans also showed little fluctuation, raw peanuts were dull, and they returned by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. The supply of broad beans was abundant, and the price fell by more than 1,000 yuan. Bean cakes were not selling well, and the supply exceeded demand, falling by 100 to 200 yuan. Wheat bran rose by 100 to 200 yuan, and oil prices rose by several hundred to 1,000 yuan.</p>

<p>Public bonds suddenly saw a large amount of short covering at low prices. The Northern clique strongly bought. Sichuan banks also showed some activity. The morning opening price for Tong Bing was 4,300 yuan, and after retreating to 4,150 yuan, it was pulled up by buyers, hovering and rising, and finally closing at a high price of 5,000 yuan, resulting in an increase of 650 yuan compared to the previous close.

<p>The yarn market was firm and then flat yesterday.

<p>Gold Market Hot Money Shifts - Hua Shares and Yongsha Alone Stand Out</p>
<p>Hua shares had gold hot money returning. A major investor surnamed Zhu raised funds to pull up Yongsha. Retail investors followed suit, with the capable buying Yongsha and the incapable engaging in hedging. As a result, small shares were the first to bear the brunt, so that except for Yongsha galloping alone, the rest lagged far behind. Yongsha's low price in the early morning was 5,900 yuan, and it closed at a high price. The lowest price for Mei Ya mid-way was 4,360 yuan, and the highest was 4,600 yuan. Jingfu rose by 310 yuan, falling to 290 yuan at the low. Xinguang retreated from 305 yuan to 285 yuan. Qinxing also retreated from a high price of 233 yuan to 218 yuan.

<h3 id="e116">Hong Kong Caustic Soda to Arrive <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>The price of caustic soda in this city has been soaring for the past week. The reason for this is that the United States has banned exports, and the tendency of foreign traders to come to Shanghai to purchase has caused merchants to prosper. It is said that the supply of caustic soda in Shanghai is not very weak, and there is a large stock of American caustic soda in Hong Kong that has nowhere to go. The price per barrel is around 200,000. If the price in Shanghai rises, the goods from Hong Kong will inevitably arrive continuously. It is said that the first batch of about 1,000 tons will be shipped to Shanghai soon. Shanghai merchants, after hearing this, intend to start selling 15-day futures within the day, so the price of caustic soda should be able to recover soon.</p>

<p>Yesterday, gold prices plummeted because news reported that the central government was fully suppressing gold prices, determined not to allow them to continue rising, and was strictly managing US dollars.

The Bank of China allocated the registered 128 dealers at a price of 1.87 million.

<p>(Another Report) According to an authoritative source from the Shangrong Bank: After restrictions were imposed on remittances to the mainland, it is currently impossible to statistically track domestic exchange rates. Larger remittances are flowing into the black market, as the exchange rate is lower, the procedures are simpler, and there are no restrictions. It is only necessary to purchase checks from local banks and stores, or exchange goods for funds. Therefore, recently, commercial banks in this city have been able to receive very few large remittances.</p>
<p>As for exchange rates, commercial banks have slightly different rates. For example, the lowest rate is in Tianjin for Kunming, Chongqing, and Ping, where 950 yuan in Shanghai can be exchanged for 1,000 yuan in Tianjin.</p>

<h3 id="e123">Changchun After the Calamity Revives <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent Han Qingtao</p>
<p>Dispatch from our Changchun Bureau, 3rd by Airmail</p>
<p>It has been over ten days since the National Army entered Changchun. In these ten days, Changchun has gradually returned to normal. A refreshing breeze, typical of early summer, has begun to blow here, soothing the people. The cessation of hostilities and the change of seasons have brought great comfort to the sorrowful.</p>
<p>Garrison Commander General Liao Yaoxiang and Deputy Commander General Shu Shucun officially took office on the 28th. Acting Mayor of Changchun Shang Chuandao, accompanied by Secretary-General Liu Shougang and others, also arrived on the 29th to take charge. Other government organs have been established one after another, while others are in preparation.</p>
<p>Order has been gradually restored, and by the beginning of this month, stability was largely achieved. Groups of citizens are cleaning the streets, clearing away broken bricks, rubble, and other obstacles, their faces revealing joy as they busily engage in preliminary reconstruction work.</p>
<p>The electricity, which had been cut off after the Communist troops withdrew, plunged everyone into darkness. Fortunately, after a brief two-day period, the lights shone brightly again. The radio station also began broadcasting news, Peking opera, and popular songs day and night.</p>
<p>At first, only small grocery stores were open for business. Later, one major store after another opened its doors. At the same time, each store was busy unearthing and moving back the goods that had been dispersed and buried, rearranging them, and erecting neon lights. Most of the customers in the stores are soldiers, and the restaurants are also filled with soldiers eating and drinking. Everyone believes that the soldiers, who have worked hard for so long, deserve some enjoyment.</p>
<p>The number of vehicles and horses on the streets is increasing day by day. Trolley cars are also running. The people seem to have awakened from a nightmare and are beginning to become active on the streets. Slogans of "Welcome the National Army" and "Long Live Chairman Chiang" are plastered all over the streets and alleys. It seems that the city of Changchun is bustling again.</p>
<p>Prices are currently much lower than in Shenyang, especially for food. Rice is 22 yuan per catty, sorghum is 7 yuan per catty, and pork is 25 yuan per catty—each Northeast circulating note is worth 13 national currency yuan. Vegetables and other items are also cheap. General merchandise is also cheaper than in Shenyang. If there is no manipulation or hoarding, and if there are no transportation problems, a period of low prices can be maintained.</p>
<p>The Japanese in Changchun did not suffer any damage when the Communist troops occupied Changchun. Now that they have hope of returning to their country, there are even more vendors selling clothes and miscellaneous goods in the former "Yoshino-cho" and "Yamato-dori" areas. The narrow streets are crowded with people buying and selling goods. The noisy and bustling scene is just like "Kasuga-cho" and "Aoba-cho" in Shenyang. The largest department store, "Hakuryu," formerly "Mitsui," is still controlled by the Japanese. The best residences are still occupied by the Japanese. The authorities are already drafting plans to regulate and suppress this situation.</p>
<p>Firefighting Jeep: The Ottawa Fire Department in the United States is testing a firefighting jeep. This type of jeep can carry five firefighters and is equipped with a pump and hoses. (Special dispatch from our newspaper by the New York Times)</p>
<h3 id="e124">The Advance and Retreat of the National and Communist Armies <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>After the liberation of the Northeast, Changchun reverted to its original name from the puppet name "Shinkyo." Personnel dispatched by the central government, Allied Soviet troops, and the people of Changchun lived together for more than eight months. Although there were some ups and downs and anxieties in between, they finally passed in an atmosphere of friendship.</p>
<p>In early April, the Soviet troops in Changchun began to withdraw. By noon on the 12th, the withdrawal was complete. From the start of the Soviet withdrawal, the atmosphere in the city gradually became tense, eventually leading to panic, due to the continuous arrival of Communist troops.</p>
<p>Communist troops arrived by train in the area north of Changchun, including Wanbaoshan, Buhai Station, and Yijianbao. In the east, Communist troops arrived from Jilin in the areas of Chaluhe, Yinmahe, and Lalatun. In the south, they arrived from Yitong in the areas of Hejiatun and Weizigou. In the west, they reached Baichengzi, thus forming an encirclement.</p>
<p>At 8 p.m. on April 12, the Communist troops began their attack. The siege began, and smoke and bullets filled the entire city of Changchun. The news spread throughout China and abroad. By the 18th, the government's isolated troops, without external support, ran out of ammunition and suffered casualties. They retreated and ceased resistance. Changchun then fell into the hands of the Communist troops.</p>
<p>The airport, the puppet State Council, the new imperial palace, the Ministry of Transportation, the Ministry of People's Livelihood, the East Bridge, South Street, Dama Road, Xi'an Bridge, the museum, the telegraph office, the Daxing Company, and the Kangde Hall all became contested strongholds and battlefields. Buildings were destroyed, and public and private lives and property suffered unprecedented damage.</p>
<p>The Communist troops entered Changchun on April 19 and withdrew on May 23. During their time in Changchun, they were busy with "liquidation" and "meetings." When they withdrew, they carried out a round of destruction. When the National Army attacked and entered, Changchun returned to the embrace of the central government. The chaos and unrest came to an end.</p>

<h3 id="e126">Questions Regarding Housing Allocation <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>Editor: The newspaper reported, "Mayor Wu told reporters: The principle of housing allocation, based on Chairman Chiang's handwritten guidelines in Nanjing, is that no more than two rooms may be occupied by five or more people, and no more than three rooms may be occupied by six or more people, and the principle of releasing houses." After reading this, I deeply admire it. However, the meaning of the principle is implicit, leading to many rumors recently. I have four questions: (1) Does the principle, "no more than four rooms for six or more people," refer to one household, or can eight rooms be occupied by twelve or more people, and so on? (2) In Shanghai's public housing, it is rare for five people to be able to live in three rooms. The practice of privately transferring housing for a gold bar has been strictly prohibited. Since this is a matter of mutual consent, who would report it? The prohibition exists only on paper. However, as a result, those without houses still have houses to live in, while those with houses have already transferred them privately and voluntarily live in crowded conditions. It seems unnecessary to limit the number of rooms and people. (3) The principle is certainly for both officials and civilians, but will it be strictly followed for the residences of high-ranking officials and superiors? (4) The report states that the allocation of housing for administrative Yuan organs in the future will be based on this principle. Does this refer to the allocation of various houses received this time to various organs, and is it unrelated to civilian rentals and self-built houses? Leading by example and treating others as oneself is called "forgiveness," and equality under the law should be observed by both superiors and subordinates. If the government, except for office buildings and Chairman Chiang's private residence, makes an exception and distributes the remaining houses of special-appointment officials to officials of equal or simplified rank, and so on from top to bottom, then there will be no housing shortage for the people. Taking Shanghai as an example, how many thousands of houses were received from Japanese officials and merchants, as well as Japanese and German expatriates and puppet residences? Who lives in them now? Has there been any allocation? If the mayor leads by example and strictly orders his subordinates to rent out all remaining houses, will it be possible to do so for the residences of important figures? Reader Zhang Fumin, June 7.</p>
<h3 id="e127">The Pitiful Primary School Teachers of Changshu! <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>Editor: Apart from Shanghai, the cultural center, Changshu was known before the war as the county with the most universal education and the most developed culture in the entire Jiangsu Province. Its cultural development and universal education were certainly due in part to the stability of life and the excellent environment. But the most important factor that cannot be ignored is that the middle and primary school teachers in Changshu County were mostly local people who were enthusiastic about local education. Due to the enthusiasm and efforts of local teachers running local education, students' academic performance undoubtedly improved rapidly.</p>
<p>But let us observe the current state of education and culture in Changshu County today. It lags behind like its ancient city walls. Compared with students in other places, it is questionable whether their grades can maintain a balance. We believe that a teacher's enthusiasm for teaching has a direct and significant impact on students' academic performance. If teachers are worried about rice and firewood all day long, and their stomachs are constantly rumbling, the academic performance of the children they educate can be left unspoken.</p>
<p>Now, a movement to respect teachers is being launched everywhere, surging like a tidal wave, with basketball charity games and radio speeches. We are truly envious because we see that teachers in other places can have considerable solutions. But let us observe the teachers of Changshu County. They are still tightening their belts, enduring hunger, and sticking to their posts. Who will initiate a respect-for-teachers movement? And who will be solicited for donations? Although the county education department has irresponsibly instructed schools to solicit donations from students, is this a good way to popularize education? Is this a fundamental method of solving teachers' hunger? Is this what teachers who run local education want to do? We would rather starve to death than ask students for a single penny!</p>
<p>I recently saw in the newspaper a disclosure of the provincial government's order that, due to frequent changes in the price index, the county government should pay civil servants' monthly salaries on a monthly basis and should not arbitrarily delay payment. At first, I was overjoyed, but who knew that the salary we received this time was still "half a month's salary advanced from April"! It is already late May and early June, and we are still "advancing" the salary for April. How should the word "advance" be interpreted? Is it possible for us to take this meager tens of thousands of yuan salary and support our families and children?</p>
<p>The adverse consequences of this situation are that qualified teachers in the area are leaving to teach elsewhere or seek other livelihoods. The remaining teachers are either perfunctory or incapable and unqualified, temporarily stopping by. But if we ask these teachers to educate our next generation, how terrible is its impact!</p>
<p>We cannot bear to witness the collapse of the education system in Changshu County, so we loudly appeal to all enthusiastic people in the community: Save the primary school teachers of Changshu County who are struggling in adverse environments and on the hunger line, save the declining education system of Changshu County! Respectfully submitted by a group of Changshu County primary school teachers, Miao Weimin, Zhu Baoshu, Huang Runan, Ji Manyun, and others.</p>

<p>The Changchun municipal government building has been burned down. Mayor Zhao Junmai has been taken away by the Communist troops. The new acting mayor, Shang Chuandao, is temporarily using the former "Chong Electric Power Company" as the new government site. This spacious building has no doors, windows, tables, or chairs. The new mayor and his subordinates are carrying out their work in this incomplete shell.</p>
<p>The "Mantetsu" building, formerly the location of the Northeast Headquarters, has been burned to the ground. Now, only the remaining shell supports the remnants. The Central Bank was also destroyed by artillery fire. The vault, once known as the best in East Asia, has been destroyed. It is said that the Communist troops put great effort into destroying this vault. In the end, they gathered Japanese technicians, used gas fire to drill small holes in the vault, and planted explosives to destroy it. The municipal government, the police department, the former Kwantung Army headquarters, and the puppet imperial palace have all been reduced to rubble.</p>
<p>The widest road in the city, the old Datong Street area, is littered with heartbreaking and tragic remains. The scene inside and outside the train station is even more desolate. Trains lie on the tracks. The scene of bustling traffic and pedestrians that once existed no longer exists today.</p>
<p>Powerful journalists have all rushed to Changchun like a race, and they are competing like wrestling for houses and equipment. The competition has become white-hot. From the perspective of journalistic spirit, this is commendable, and they have made the utmost effort. From another perspective, some say that this is an unreasonable phenomenon because there is no overall planning and distribution plan.</p>
<p>The first to publish was the "Forward Daily," which took over the puppet "Kangde News" and began publishing less than a week after the National Army entered Changchun, on May 28. This was followed by the "New Life News," "Dahua Daily," "Changchun Daily," "Youth Daily," and "Northeast People's Daily," a total of six newspapers. There are still five or six more in preparation for publication, some of whom are "laying down their guns to pick up their pens."</p>
<p>During the puppet Manchukuo era, Changchun had only two newspapers, "Kangde News" and "Manchukuo-Chosen Daily." Now, it has developed rapidly. Naturally, there are uneven distribution and lack of equipment and facilities. The order of arrival and the presence or absence of power have been fully and clearly demonstrated today. The atmosphere of everyone competing to run newspapers is very tense here!</p>
<p>The National Army has stationed in Changchun. Receiving personnel, administrative officials, and technical personnel are arriving one after another on the road from Shenyang to Changchun. The 800,000 people of Changchun are also looking forward to assisting these personnel who have arrived and have not yet arrived. At the same time, they hope that there will be no more chaotic reception phenomena like those in other places. Although there are already some places that do not quite comply with the regulations, they hope that this will stop here and that Changchun will soon embark on the road of revival and construction!</p>
<h3 id="e129">Eastern Monte Carlo: Recent Developments in Macau <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>Dispatch from our Hong Kong Bureau, 1st by Airmail. Special Correspondent Lin Youlan</p>
<p>Reuters suddenly sent a message from Lisbon, Portugal, on May 22, stating that, according to reliable sources, the United States is currently negotiating with Portugal to establish an air base in Portuguese Macau, outside the Pearl River estuary. As early as May 8, the Macau Chinese-language newspaper *Hua Qiao Bao* reported that "Pan American Airlines of the United States had set up a branch office in Macau and established an airplane landing field in the nearby waters to facilitate the Far East air route. With the outbreak of the Pacific War, it was suspended.</p>
<p>Small Area to Become an Air Station</p>
<p>After the end of the war, Pan American actively resumed operations and has successively restored air stations in Singapore, Manila, and other places. The Macau side is also planning. Recently, the old matter was brought up again, and personnel were sent to Macau to handle everything. The construction of an airport in Macau will be announced and realized." Macau, a small area, may soon become one of the world's air stations. Taking this opportunity, I will briefly describe recent events in Macau, hoping that the Chinese people will not completely ignore this small peninsula at the southernmost tip of the Pearl River Delta.</p>
<p>Not long ago, the gambling king of Macau, Fu Deyin (also known as Fu Laorong), was kidnapped by bandits in a temple and demanded 100 catties of gold as ransom. This news spread throughout Guangdong and Hong Kong. Fu Laorong and Gao Kening's Tai Hing General Company contracted all of Macau's casinos and entertainment businesses (including hotels, restaurants, and dance halls). He is nothing less than the "Tsar" of this "Eastern Monte Carlo." In today's world, where there is a universal ban on opium and gambling, Macau is a city where opium dens and gambling houses can openly operate, and local government expenses come from opium taxes and gambling revenue—a center for creating evil and destroying civilization.</p>
<p>Before the War, Hong Kong Residents Went to Macau to Gamble on Weekends</p>
<p>It is only a four-hour boat ride from Hong Kong to Macau. Before the war, Macau was the most ideal weekend destination for Hong Kong people. In Hong Kong, boats departed for Macau at 8 a.m. and 2 p.m. every day. From Macau back to Hong Kong, in addition to the two boats in the morning and afternoon, there was also a midnight boat, departing at 2 a.m. and arriving in the early morning, which was perfect for pleasure-seekers and those looking to get drunk. If you placed a considerable number of bets in the casino, they would prepare a first-class ticket back to Hong Kong, so that even if you lost all your money, you would not be stranded in a foreign land, sighing at the sea. Now, the people of Hong Kong and Guangzhou are so pressed for survival that how many still have the leisure to go to Macau to spend extravagantly!</p>
<p>People Gone, Buildings Empty: Peach Blossom Spring Culture Becomes a Deserted Island</p>
<p>Macau has encountered a serious economic downturn. What has deepened the economic downturn in Macau in particular is the large-scale repatriation of refugees from the wartime. The current population remaining in Macau is more than 100,000. During the war, Macau, like Lisbon, hung up the signboard of neutrality, and fortunately escaped the baptism of artillery fire. People from Hong Kong and Guangdong flocked to seek refuge, and Macau became a utopia. But good times do not last long, and now people are gone and buildings are empty, and the city is desolate. If Hong Kong were not overcrowded and Guangzhou were not suffering from famine and epidemics at the same time.</p>
<p>Macau can be said to have no commerce, and its only industry cannot escape its fate. The cement factory has long been shut down due to a lack of raw materials. Matches and cigarettes, for a time, sold well in Guangdong and Hong Kong. But recently, American matches and cigarettes have flooded in, and the market price is not more expensive than Macau goods. Macau goods are gradually being eliminated. The value of Macau currency issued by Banco Nacional Ultramarino is similar to that of Hong Kong currency, with a difference of no more than 2%. Macau currency and Hong Kong currency are inextricably linked. The subtle political relationship between Hong Kong and Macau is also reflected in this economic proximity.</p>
<p>Suppressing National Currency: Travelers Suffer Innocently</p>
<p>Relying on the remaining power of its "supreme master," the Macau government has always shown a hideous and hateful face to our country's military and civilians. Before the war, the Macau authorities expressly forbade our army from setting foot in Macau. A small squad of black-faced troops from Portuguese East Africa, stationed at the Guanzha border between China and Portugal, arbitrarily arrested Chinese people in military uniforms crossing the border. There was even a time when even civil servants and students wearing Zhongshan suits were subjected to their humiliation. In schools, our students were forced to learn Portuguese. The unreasonable persecution of local residents by the Portuguese authorities under the power of the Japanese is especially unforgettable. The extraordinary measures for postal, telegraphic, and news censorship implemented in 1943 have not yet been abolished. Recently, it has also promulgated a restriction that travelers are not allowed to bring more than 50,000 yuan of national currency into the country, and countless travelers coming and going have suffered innocently. After the local chamber of commerce made many requests to the Governor of Macau, Teixeira de Sousa, the limit was increased to 500,000 yuan. This is obviously a measure to suppress the national currency and maintain the Macau currency, which has no reserve funds—even Hong Kong, which is directly ruled by the British, does not treat us so harshly!</p>
<p>Portuguese Infringement of Rights: Our Country Should Make a Statement</p>
<p>Macau was leased by our government to the Portuguese in 1557 (during the Ming Jiajing period) as a place for ships to sail in the Far East, opening the floodgates for foreigners to establish concession areas within our national territory. At that time, it was stipulated that the Portuguese should pay an annual land rent of 500 taels, and the area was limited to Guanqian Street and Sanba Gate (see *Yi Wu Shi Mo*, volume 27). According to the charter, China was entitled to establish officials and collect customs duties in Macau, and it was declared that it could not be transferred to others. However, over time, the rent was not paid, and taking advantage of our country's turbulent times, they gradually expanded their borders. All the lands along the Dutch Garden, Wangxia, and even Guanzha were occupied by the Portuguese outside the charter. There was a time when the Portuguese's greed could not be satisfied, and they even crossed into Wan Chai and Liang Keng (belonging to Zhongshan County) on the opposite bank of Macau, wanting to occupy them as their own. Whether Coloane, where Pan American Airlines plans to build an air base, faces our Hengqin Island, is Portuguese territory remains to be verified. The Portuguese government, regardless of everything, negotiated with the United States in Lisbon, disregarding our country's sovereignty. Regarding this point, our diplomatic authorities seem to need to make a formal statement to the United States.</p>
<p>Returning the Land by a Deadline is Just and Reasonable</p>
<p>We want to recover lost territory, and we also want to recover Macau, removing the stain on our territory. After Japan surrendered last year, the opinion circles of the wartime capital advocated that our authorities first recover Macau, because there is very little contact between China and Portugal in peacetime, and the Portuguese have no vested interests in the Far East. In our efforts to strengthen governance and vigorously renovate today, if the Portuguese respect our country's sovereignty, they should return Macau without us even having to open our mouths. How could the Portuguese still be attached to the dreams of the past, pretending to be powerful, and becoming more and more aggressive, disregarding our good intentions or friendship? Although the government now has tasks that are many times more important than recovering Macau that need to be completed, it is easy to set a deadline for the return of this small area of six square miles, which is just and reasonable. In Hong Kong, British intellectuals have revealed that they will return it immediately to promote Sino-British friendship, and the London officials who understand the overall situation have also revealed that they will reform the political system and grant autonomy. But what is Portugal? In other people's pure land, it opens opium and gambling, destroys civilization, and violates international law. Not only does it not show any remorse, but it is arrogant and aggressive, and reverses the roles of host and guest. We love peace and value friendship, but we should not be too tolerant of petty villains, because the repercussions will only allow conspirators to be unscrupulous and take an inch and want a mile.</p>
<p>Macau is located at the mouth of the Pearl River and stands side by side with Guangzhou and Hong Kong. It is 40 miles east of Hong Kong and 100 miles north of Guangzhou. It belongs to Zhongshan County and is about 30 miles from Dr. Sun Yat-sen's hometown of Cuiheng Village. It has a wide waterway leading to Jiangmen and Sanbu, which is more convenient for transportation in the upper reaches of the West River than Guangzhou. Traveling west along the coast to Guangzhou Bay (now renamed Zhanjiang City), which was recovered after the war, merchants from both places have frequent exchanges.</p>

<h3 id="e130">Increased Birth Rate After Demobilization of British Army; Frequent Divorce Cases of Soldiers <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>This newspaper's London dispatch, dated the 2nd, special correspondent Xueyan.</p>
<p>Along with all the demobilization announcements in Britain, there is also a "demobilization" of births. The return of soldiers from the front lines and the reunion of families have naturally led to an increase in infant births. However, the problem is that the population registration this spring indicates an unexpected increase of 17,000 births compared to expectations. Based on this trend, it is estimated that there will be 40,000 more births in the summer, making this unexpected increase a serious problem. The primary concern is the shortage of midwives, followed by the inadequacy of equipment in maternity hospitals to meet the needs. The Minister of Health, Mr. Bevan, has appealed to local authorities to make every effort to assist pregnant women. Needless to say, the salaries of midwives and those working in maternity hospitals will be increased. Every effort will be made to facilitate external midwives who are willing to work, and those who have changed professions will be assisted in returning to their original jobs. In addition, some Red Cross nurses have already been transferred to maternity hospitals. With these efforts by the Ministry of Health, the summer problem is expected to be resolved.</p>
<p>In Britain, if three people are buying the same item at the same time, they have to queue. This was the case during the war because the number of shop assistants decreased and the queues became longer. Now that the war has ended for a year, people want to know if the queuing situation has improved. A public opinion survey will be conducted in England, Scotland, and Wales in mid-May, asking: "Based on your personal experience, is the time you spend queuing to buy anything now more or less than a year ago?" In the answers, 31% said more, 36% said the same, 19% said less, and 14% said they didn't know. However, in Britain, most people who go out to buy things are women, so the answers from women may be more accurate. To the same question, the answers from women only were: 38% said more, 35% said the same, 20% said less, and 7% said they didn't know. From this, it seems that the time spent queuing is longer, or at least those who say they need less time are in the minority.</p>
<h3 id="e131">The Problem of Demobilization of Polish Soldiers: A New Burden for Britain <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>During this war, about 500,000 Polish soldiers participated in the war against Germany and Italy under the leadership of the Polish government-in-exile in London. Regardless of their political views, these people have all served the Allied countries. Because the Polish government-in-exile was based in Britain and mainly supported by Britain, Britain is in the best position to appreciate their contributions. However, as a result of the Yalta Conference, the Polish government in London must merge with the people's government in Poland, which means that the Polish government-in-exile loses its basis for existence. Therefore, its leadership of the 500,000 soldiers also suffers from the difficulty of not knowing who to follow. During the war, they were incorporated into the British and American armies, receiving wages for their service, so the problem was not serious. Now that the war has long ended and the soldiers are busy demobilizing, where these Polish soldiers should go has become a serious problem. Logically, they can naturally return to Poland, but we know that the current Polish government is similar to the Soviet Union. These soldiers, trained by Britain and the United States, feel incompatible and mostly express their unwillingness to return. In addition, this February, the Polish government announced that if these soldiers wish to return to their country, they should not disband their troops and return individually in order to be properly resettled, which makes them even more uneasy. Fortunately, the British government strongly supports them. When discussing refugee relief at the United Nations General Assembly, Britain insisted that anyone who is unwilling to return to their country due to different political views should also be regarded as refugees for relief. The Soviet Union and Poland strongly opposed this, and both sides clearly realized the problem of the demobilized Polish soldiers. It is estimated that most of these 500,000 people are now in Germany, accounting for about three-fifths of the total, followed by Italy, with more than 100,000, and Britain, with about 40,000 to 50,000. Now, the Polish army in Italy has begun to disband. Only 3,000 people are willing to return to Poland individually under the conditions offered by the current Polish government to re-establish their livelihoods. The remaining 110,000 will be transported to Britain, becoming a new burden for the British government. The British government has promised them to do its best to resettle them and help them re-establish their livelihoods. For example, it will negotiate with various autonomous territories and South American countries that still have room for immigration, asking them to accommodate some of them. The rest will also be found jobs in Britain and mainland Europe. It is said that prisoner-of-war camps and coal mines still need people, so it should be possible to resettle some of them. Before finding suitable jobs, these demobilized Polish soldiers will temporarily remain in military camps awaiting orders and receiving salaries, but wartime allowances will be cancelled. However, the biggest problem in the future is still the Polish people in Germany, because there are too many of them, and it may be more difficult to find a way out.</p>

<p>Legal Inquiries</p>
<p>(1) Yu Lianying asks: I am an orphaned girl, living with my uncle's family. I call my aunt and uncle parents. Later, my uncle passed away, and I lived with my cousin's family. I am responsible for all the housework, laundry, cooking, and everything else. Later, my family believed in astrology and said that I had a hard and bitter fate, and that I should marry an older man and be his second wife. Therefore, a matchmaker was arranged, and I was engaged to a Mr. X, who is 38 years old, 16 years older than me, and has been married twice before. At that time, if I didn't agree, I would not be tolerated in my uncle's house, and my mother would not dare to take me back home. Forced by circumstances, I got engaged at the end of last year. I have several questions and would like to ask for guidance: (1) I am 22 years old, do I have the right to make my own marriage decisions? (2) Although I agreed to the engagement last year, it was forced by circumstances and not my own free will. Can I refuse to acknowledge it now? (3) If I must get married, for the sake of my lifelong happiness, I have no choice but to run away and work as a servant. I wonder if this would violate any criminal laws? (4) If I run away and am found by my family, and I vow not to go home, can my family send me to a reformatory or a police station? (5) If I run away, can Mr. X sue me in court or negotiate with my uncle, demanding compensation for his losses?</p>
<p>[Lawyer Zhu Yakui answers:] (1) Marriage is a right of self-determination. (2) Since you have already agreed, you cannot break the engagement unless there is a reason for invalidation or cancellation (refer to Articles 72 and 92 of the Civil Code). (3) According to Article 976, Paragraph 1, Item 2 of the Civil Code, you should be liable for damages. (4) Since you are an adult, you cannot be sent there unless you have engaged in illegal activities. (5) He can only sue you personally and claim damages.</p>
<p>(2) Zhang Weiwen asks: My father, in his hometown, is known for his integrity and high moral character, and is highly respected by the villagers. In 1940, he was elected as the head of the village. My father and others were unwilling to tarnish their reputation, so the village head fled first. My father was appointed as the village head because he was unable to leave. However, he was unwilling to do so, so he paid to get rid of the position. However, he was originally a member of the school's economic management committee. Because the school was temporarily closed, he remained in his old position and did not pay attention to it. Now that the country has been recovered, this old position seems to be a stain. My father is very uneasy. I wonder if he is suspected of collaboration?</p>
<p>[Lawyer Zhu Yakui answers:] If the school you mentioned was established before the occupation and was not registered with the puppet government, there should be no problem.</p>

<h3 id="e134">The Mood of an Old Maid <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>— Shao Fu</p>
<p>Yesterday, in the "Haitian" supplement of the Heping Daily, there was a lantern riddle reveal. The riddle was "The mood of an old maid," and the answer was "Shoot one famous reporter." Mr. Chen Guozeng and Mr. Li Qinglai were the first to answer correctly with "Xia Shao Fu."</p>
<p>I wouldn't dare say that my friends are playing a joke on me, but they are exaggerating a bit too much, because although I have been a "reporter" for thirteen years, I am not necessarily "famous." There are many senior colleagues, so how dare I presume?</p>
<p>However, the riddle "The mood of an old maid" makes me conjure up infinite thoughts.</p>
<p>A beautiful woman in her twilight years is indeed having a hard time. She wants to marry, but who should she marry? Younger men may not fancy her, and older men she is unwilling to accept. To remain single for the rest of her life is, after all, unfair to her whole life. Thinking back and forth, she is in a dilemma. This kind of mental distress is multiplied on nights with a clear moon and a gentle breeze, and mornings with fragrant flowers and singing birds.</p>
<p>The poor and the rich are the same. Wealthy old maids are sometimes even more painful, because someone who enjoys a high degree of material comfort often feels a more urgent need for spiritual comfort and appreciates the preciousness of spiritual comfort and the fun of life. Friends who are worried about firewood and rice would not have such thoughts!</p>
<p>As for their fate, it is very simple. Those who are unwilling to remain in obscurity mostly "go to society" and engage in various career activities. Those with weak abilities eat vegetarian food and chant Buddhist scriptures, using religion as an emotional outlet. As for those who seek young husbands, they are probably very few exceptions.</p>
<p>"People reach middle age with two kinds of suffering; life is not easy, death is not sweet," I am afraid I am now also feeling the mood of an old maid, so the lantern riddle made by my friend can be said to have hit the nail on the head.</p>
<h3 id="e135">Confucius Temple: Twenty-Four Hours <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>— Xian Chang</p>
<p>Nanjing is the capital of our country, and the Confucius Temple is the heart of this capital. It has beautiful scenery and a mysterious atmosphere. It is an important scene in Nanjing and reflects most of Nanjing's outline, which is no doubt. After the victory, the Confucius Temple has become more prosperous than before. It is not only the site of the Six Dynasties' golden powder on the banks of the Qinhuai River, but also a concentration of commercial entertainment. After the National Government returned to the capital, it became a place for military and government personnel to come and go.</p>
<p>When it gets late at night, the shops have already closed their doors tightly. Apart from a few cars with black license plates and a small number of newly born jeeps running around, only the rickshaw pullers parked on the side of the road are snoring on their cars, recovering from their fatigue of the day. In this dead silence, after the restaurants and shops close, the beggars have long finished their giraffe work (stretching their long necks to beg from the rich and powerful) and come to this concentration camp—the Pan Palace. Their utterly exhausted expressions, covered with straw mats, sleep on the sandy ground, but it is a symbol of hunger. Undoubtedly, it is like a clever director who wants to make the "scene" more distinctive in terms of rich and poor, noble and lowly, and make some need applicable to the "plot." The god of night has already succeeded.</p>
<p>When the sunlight begins to emerge from the horizon during the day, the Confucius Temple is resurrected from the dead. Yellow, black, green, and various colored cars flash through the Confucius Temple at lightning speed. The shops also gradually opened their iron gates, and a burst of children selling newspapers came. The streets and alleys were crowded with people, most of whom were civil servants going to their offices, and the rest were ordinary coolies, workers, and vendors who were struggling to make a living every day. The Confucius Temple is a kaleidoscope; it has everything. All kinds of ingenious advertisements, with colorful silk flags fluttering in the breeze, artistic comics, layered and hung in bright colors, a dazzling array, shocking sacrifices of "buy one get one free" blaring around the street, as a call. The ladies who come and go are dressed in gorgeous clothes; especially the singers, who are painted like artistic sculptures; they come and go in this commercial prosperity, where Chinese and foreign people gather in the Confucius Temple, making their mobile advertisements. In this thriving Confucius Temple—Pan Palace, it can also be said to be a public place for unemployed vagrants. Nine streams, three teachings, and all kinds of things gather in one place, performing magic tricks and selling wound medicine. Singing ditties, dismantling character stalls, and there are also a kind of "Jianghu performers," making faces and dropping spears to make a living. Indeed! From the time the sunlight begins to shine until it sets, the Confucius Temple has always passed in hustle and bustle, without a moment's peace. Every minute, every place, is shouting and yelling. Radio waves and car sounds are mixed together, and yelling and miscellaneous human voices are mixed into one, with lively and dead silence being completely and absolutely opposite. When the sun sets in the west, the dusk is even more lively. Neon lights are turned on on the doors of the shops, illuminating pairs of lovers, and goddesses with faces covered with rouge powder and charming gods, gracefully strolling to and fro on the banks of the Qinhuai River—the Confucius Temple, looking for their night's rest. The breeze blows their paper-thin clothes, startling the flesh exposed in the night. However, they still smile at the Confucius Temple. At this time, the Confucius Temple is at its most prosperous. Amusement parks, cinemas, cafes, restaurants, and tea rooms are all extremely crowded. Jeeps, special cars for National Assembly representatives, and black cars parked at the door are arranged in a long snake formation in one line; all kinds of different sounds and strange lights are illuminating and fascinating. The prosperity of the Confucius Temple is so praised as the heart and pulse of the capital and a scenic spot for the golden powder of the Six Dynasties; this can be seen in the three periods of day, night, and dusk.</p>

<p>— Xin</p>
<p>Eight years of war have aged me.</p>
<p>In vain I see the beauty of Jiangnan.</p>
<p>Reluctantly swinging on the swing like a youth,</p>
<p>But helplessly, my temples are already speckled with gray.</p>

<h3 id="e138">The Process of Nazi Forces Infiltrating South America <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>— Zhuxi</p>
<p>(I)</p>
<p>Approximately a century ago, Germany had already set its sights on Argentina, a country across the vast ocean of South America, as a destination for its aggression. Germany established a Pan-German strategic organization in Argentina, and President Sarmiento, a prominent figure in Argentina's Democratic Party at the time, was the first to protest. When the world was still indifferent to German activities in 1882, Sarmiento keenly discerned Germany's ambition and issued a warning to his fellow countrymen and the nations of South America: "Once the German settlements in Argentina, Paraguay, Uruguay, and southern Brazil have established a solid foundation, they will one day become powerful and dangerous colonies of Germans who are solely loyal to their motherland."</p>
<p>Germany spared no expense in systematically implementing its colonization policy on the American continent according to its predetermined plan. Money was spent lavishly, and large quantities of goods were continuously imported into the country. Simultaneously, they reclaimed wasteland, built schools, rewarded practices, and exchanged academic culture. Before long, German bloodlines and German ideology had swept across many important locations in Argentina. Soon after, purely Germanic German areas appeared one after another in various South American countries.</p>
<p>Germany unreservedly promoted its mass transatlantic immigration policy. It passed a special law in the country for immigration to South America and openly established various industrial organizations, banks, schools, clubs, and research institutions, all with the sole purpose of infiltrating South America. Germans who went abroad underwent a kind of ideological training, considering themselves to be superior people of the ruling class.</p>
<p>However, during World War I, Germany's influence in South America suddenly declined. All commercial, political, and cultural ties were completely severed, and the movement of capital also ceased, causing German colonial activities to come to a standstill. The United States and its allies seized this opportunity to improve their own positions.</p>
<p>After World War I, the world focused on reconstruction, striving to forget the cruelty of war and seeking only rest and peace. But the minds of German ambitious people never rested for a moment.</p>
<p>In addition to the philosophy of the German philosopher Clausewitz, who held that "Germany's sacred mission is to civilize other nations," a new science, "Geopolitics," was added. These distorted theories deceived the general Nazi thugs, who implemented their aggressive policies in the name of the "Pan-German League," various overseas organizations, and the German diplomatic corps.</p>
<p>Hess, Bormann, Goebbels, and other Nazi leaders organized a special agency under the pretext of protecting overseas German minorities, coercing overseas German expatriates to join the German National Socialist Party, making them a weapon of German aggression.</p>
<p>(II)</p>
<p>Hitler's Pan-German strategists discovered that British and American commercial forces had infiltrated South America, while the United States, with a new enlightened policy, called on South American countries to unite and help each other to cope with aggressive forces. At this time, Germany urgently caught up, on the one hand, advocating narrow nationalism, threatening and enticing opponents, creating a terrifying situation, on the other hand, greatly expanding industrial and commercial forces, severely affecting British and American commerce.</p>
<p>The Nazi Party used various means to bring the German colonies in South America under the control of the party one by one. Among them, the most powerful was the overseas branch of the Nazi Party, which organized its own police force, intelligence team, and armed forces. All German expatriates had to join the party, otherwise they could not work in German commercial firms and would be in danger of starvation.</p>
<p>According to the investigation of the Argentine government, the Nazi Party had established in Argentina commercial and financial institutions with strong funds, large-scale propaganda organizations, social and cultural groups, more than 200 schools, military liaison stations, and intelligence agencies. The funds for their activities were partly issued by the German Embassy in Buenos Aires via Berlin, partly extorted from Argentine German merchants, and partly freely donated by businessmen. These institutions were under the command of the military attaché of the German Embassy and Nazi Party special agents.</p>
<p>The money used by the German Embassy for political bribery was so astounding that scandals frequently occurred, resulting in the government enacting laws to restrict the funds that any foreign embassy could use. As a result, the Nazi Party members in Argentina exhausted their ability to impose exorbitant taxes and levies. Volberg, a representative of the German Chamber of Commerce, admitted that he had raised US$250,000 in "relief funds" in 1940-41. At the same time, Volberg spent hundreds of thousands of dollars to print the German propaganda newspaper *El Pampero*, which wantonly attacked the late President Roosevelt and Pan-Americanism, boasted about the military successes of the Axis powers, and promoted militaristic nationalism.</p>
<p>German propaganda in Argentina had two major themes: the threat of American imperialism and Germany's benevolence and kindness. The purposes were twofold: one was to arouse the patriotism of Argentinians and arouse hatred towards the United States, and the other was to incite Argentinians to recognize Nazi Germany's world leadership. Although this attempt was not successful, people with wavering wills were ultimately bewitched by this doctrine.</p>
<p>(III)</p>
<p>At the same time, Argentina was gradually moving towards military dictatorship. President Ortiz handed over power to Vice President Castillo in 1941, but Castillo could not lead a country that had been muddled by propaganda. The Argentine army was mostly trained by the Germans, and most of the senior officers had served in the German army, holding the German spirit in extreme reverence. With the help of these military men, the legitimate government of Argentina was finally overthrown by force, and all democratic institutions were closed by the army.</p>
<p>During World War II, Germany could not fulfill its promises made in Mexico City. First, Argentina failed to close the German commercial institutions that were waging economic war against the United Nations in a timely manner; second, the Argentine government failed to close Axis propaganda and instead closed newspapers that advocated democracy.</p>
<p>After Germany lost the war, Argentina remained under a military dictatorship. As long as the Argentine people live under this dictatorship, and as long as any nation in the world does not have freedom, we cannot rest easy for a single day.</p>
<h3 id="e139">Difficulty of Living <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>— Shenying</p>
<p>After reading Mr. Shaofu's article "Gold Bars," which mentioned President Ma of the Nanjing *Central Daily News* declaring war on his landlord, I found it to be detached from reality, which aroused my sympathy!</p>
<p>Of the necessities of life—clothing, food, housing, and transportation—housing is the third issue, but instability and threats to life outweigh clothing and food. My family lives in Suzhou. This past January, the landlord told us that his family members who had been serving in the military in the rear were now returning to Suzhou and asked us to move out immediately. I told him that even a wonton vendor couldn't just pack up and move, let alone a family. The next day, an active-duty soldier came. "When a scholar meets a soldier, there's no reasoning with him." Under these unreasonable circumstances, I hurriedly found two rooms in a building, paying rent equivalent to one dan of rice, plus a tip ten times the value of the rice. Fortunately, we weren't left living in the open air, and we got through this difficult time.</p>
<p>Time flies, and four months have passed in the blink of an eye. The price of rice has soared more than tenfold in these hundred-plus days. I can no longer afford the rent of one dan of rice. Fortunately, the local government, recognizing the seriousness of the housing problem, stipulated that rent could not be calculated based on the price of rice. Based on this regulation, I gathered a mediator and the landlord to negotiate, but the result was that not even a sheng of rice could be reduced. From my scholarly perspective, there probably isn't a better solution than offering the landlord one shi of rice.</p>
<p>The first priority in housing is stability. If you're arguing and bickering every day, you don't have the time, and it's too mentally exhausting. Government officials make empty promises, and the reality is that they won't be fulfilled. Scholars writing articles in newspapers can only achieve a reasonable argument on paper. To truly declare war on the landlord probably requires a different kind of person.</p>
<p>Prices are high, life is difficult, people's desires are rampant, and they treat money like life. The issue is no longer about what is reasonable or unreasonable. However, I have deeply tasted the bitterness of the difficulty of living.</p>
<h3 id="e140">Helicopter <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>— Nanyi</p>
<p>In today's world, airplanes have become commonplace, but helicopters are still rarely seen, at least in China.</p>
<p>The history of helicopters is not long, but they have undergone significant development during wartime, and the scope of their application is expanding day by day. Although this type of aircraft cannot keep up with ordinary airplanes in terms of speed, it has many advantages of its own.</p>
<p>For example: (1) Ordinary airplanes must have a large airfield for takeoff and landing, while helicopters only need a small piece of land. It is said that helicopters can land very accurately. If you draw a circle on the ground first, it will obediently stop in the middle. Recently, several post offices in the United States have been trying to use rooftops to allow helicopters to land on them, thereby speeding up mail delivery. In addition, more and more private individuals are preparing to purchase helicopters, because as long as there is a green lawn in the home, they can rise and descend as they please.</p>
<p>(2) Ordinary airplanes can only fly straight forward and cannot stop in the air, but helicopters can do this. During the war, the military relied on this performance of helicopters to save the lives of many soldiers. When military personnel were lost in remote mountains and wilderness or adrift in the vast ocean, helicopters could fly to these places where ordinary airplanes could not land, hover in the air, and drop soft ladders to give assistance to those in distress. At the same time, helicopters are more accurate in throwing items than ordinary airplanes. Sometimes when ships or trains catch fire, helicopters can quickly send fire-fighting drugs to the firefighters on the ship and train, with almost no mistakes.</p>
<p>(3) Ordinary airplanes can only fly straight forward at high altitudes, while helicopters can fly at extremely low altitudes, as close as 25 feet from the ground, and the speed can be extremely slow, so they can fly around corners and everywhere. This is extremely useful for work such as spraying insecticides like DDT. In the future, they will definitely make many contributions in epidemic prevention and exploration.</p>
<p>Currently, because helicopters have not yet reached the stage of mass production, the price is quite expensive, ranging from 10,000 to 50,000 US dollars per aircraft. In the future, it may be reduced to 4,000 to 5,000 US dollars per aircraft. At present, American manufacturers have already put a lot of effort into this area, and the age of helicopters is coming.

<h3 id="e141">Destiny <a href="#e141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>— Yang Mou</p>
<p>Some have hardships, some have triumphs. Knowledge does not necessarily guarantee your success, and virtue may not necessarily make you soar. In the face of obvious contrasts, you often feel filled with discouragement and have to attribute it to destiny.</p>
<p>Yes, this is the best way to comfort yourself, but it is by no means a way to solve the problem.</p>
<p>We may as well believe that destiny exists, but we must never entrust ourselves to destiny.</p>
<p>Looking back on the ebb and flow of history, we who read history often feel inexplicable sadness, because the development of history can never meet our ideals, and the historical figures who have suffered the manipulation of destiny are too numerous to count.</p>
<p>But the reason why historical figures become historical figures is always the result of their breaking through destiny.</p>
<p>Discouragement, succumbing to the manipulation of destiny, will be abandoned by destiny. Opportunities require you to meet them and find them; they will never come looking for you. Each failure adds a point of courage, believing that you are one step closer to success, then the price of this failure is not in vain.</p>
<p>Who is more powerful than destiny? Those who face destiny without fear of difficulty and setbacks.</p>
<p>Brief Comments</p>
<h3 id="e142">Both Are Grain Officials: Yang Xizhi and Cheng Maoxing <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>— Wulingren</p>
<p>Inspector Cheng exposed the inside story of the 940 million yuan grain loan scandal and impeached four grain officials, including Yang Xizhi. In his official letter to the Executive Yuan, he stated: "The evil of unscrupulous merchants is obvious, while the crime of corruption is hidden and difficult to see. For several years, unscrupulous merchants have run rampant, and those who support and encourage them are corrupt officials and bureaucrats. If you want to eradicate unscrupulous merchants, you must first eliminate corrupt officials and bureaucrats." These words are excellent. Unscrupulous merchants are not limited to grain and rice, and is corruption limited only to grain officials?</p>
<p>Cheng Maoxing, a member of the Jiangxi Provincial Government and director of the Jiangxi Provincial Land Tax and Grain Management Office, committed suicide by throwing himself into the river because he was supervising the purchase and transportation of grain and was worried about the failure to complete the task and was unwilling to shirk responsibility. The National Government issued a clear commendation for his actions. However, Shanghai is currently experiencing a major grain loan scandal. Both are grain officials, but their virtue and lack thereof are worlds apart, which is said with much feeling.</p>
<p>It is said that in recent days, the weather forecasts of the observatory have often been inaccurate. This is not surprising. Originally, "The sky has unpredictable winds and clouds," and worldly affairs are also unpredictable, let alone the weather.</p>
<p>Reuters London: "Shanghai, the Soviet Union, and Singapore currently have a strong need for diamonds." This also shows that there are still many rich people in Shanghai?</p>
<p>American tycoon Mr. Rider, who came to Shanghai from the United States, told reporters: "Currently, there are more US banknotes than goods in the United States, and there is a phenomenon of having money but nowhere to buy goods." However, American goods are everywhere on the Shanghai market, and even rickshaw pullers are gorging themselves on chocolate. Isn't this a joke?</p>

<h3 id="e143">UNRRA Foreign Staff: Three Crates of Beer Per Month <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>— Feng Yi</p>
<p>Talking about the current labor unrest, the inside story of the barbering industry is the most complicated. There is open and secret struggle between labor and management, and there is a possibility of each side going to extremes. In Shanghai, both the bathhouse and barbering industries have the style of "big playboys." Knives go in white and come out red, and fighting often becomes the last resort when words fail. Bosses are willing to spend money to hire people to work hard and pull strings behind the scenes, but the workers also have a spirit of hard work that cannot be underestimated, so looking at the future development of the "undercurrent," there is still a feeling of a long night with many dreams.</p>
<p>In order to increase work efficiency, Mayor Wu has taken measures to streamline personnel in the municipal government. More than 100 members were laid off this month, including important officials such as counselors and commissioners. It is heard that after the fact, many personnel, because they were related to the "department," went through various connections and back doors, but Mayor Wu has the determination to "lay off personnel" and cannot have the contradictory phenomenon of stopping and using again, so regardless of origin and without giving face, all are rejected. The members also think that Mayor Wu has a heart of stone, and they can only sigh helplessly. Recently, Mayor Wu also has a general discussion on laying off personnel in various affiliated agencies of the municipal government, so everyone is uneasy and suspects each other, wondering who will win the "jackpot" first? It is said that the treatment of civil servants is usually meager, but once employed, it is better than nothing after all.</p>
<p>The Star Island football team's visit to Shanghai for the competition was wildly popular and had good income, which aroused great interest from the backstage boss of a local football club, who intends to "hire at a high price" some players from the Star East team to stay in Shanghai and serve. It is now learned that both sides are secretly negotiating and discussing the terms, but whether or not it will be successful is still in the immature stage. However, according to another source, after the Star East team's competition in Shanghai, they also intend to go to Australia again, and plan to select some players from Shanghai to join the cooperation, preparing for a grand expedition across the ocean. From this point of view, whether the Star East team will be annexed by others or annex others depends entirely on the level of each person's terms.</p>
<p>In addition to salaries, UNRRA staff also have rationed items to share, but there are still differences, that is, foreign staff receive more favorable treatment. Taking beer as an example: foreign staff can receive three large crates per month, with each crate costing only more than 3,000 yuan, while Chinese staff can only receive one large crate per month, with each crate costing more than 10,000 yuan. As for the high or low charge, it is said that the customs believes that foreign staff are guests, so all rationed items are completely tax-free, while Chinese staff are not.</p>

<h3 id="e144">The Center of Epidemic Prevention Work <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>— Qiao Shumin</p>
<p>Starting from the Epidemiological History of Cholera</p>
<p>Cholera prevention work requires the cooperation of all sectors of society and multifaceted efforts to be effective. In terms of personal hygiene, the key is to carefully prevent germs from entering the body and to get vaccinated to enhance the body's resistance, as mentioned in the previous issue of this publication. In terms of public health, there is also a focus; without understanding this and blindly engaging in it, little success can be achieved. This is why most of the epidemic prevention work in our country for the past hundred years has been a failure story.</p>
<p>Ancient China did not have true cholera. What they called cholera was indigestion, meaning vomiting and diarrhea, which was actually acute gastroenteritis or food poisoning, not today's true cholera. To treat today's cholera with the elixirs and acupuncture passed down from ancient times is extremely foolish.</p>
<p>Before 1817, true cholera was confined to the delta region of the Ganges River in India. In 1815, the area was flooded, and the following year there was a severe drought. In 1817, it suffered another flood. From then on, cholera suddenly became rampant, invading the continents of Europe, Asia, America, and Africa through sea and land transportation routes, causing six major world epidemics. The first major epidemic was from 1817 to 1823, limited to Asia; the second was from 1826 to 1837, penetrating into Western Europe; the third was from 1846 to 1862, invading the Americas in addition to Europe and Asia; the fourth was from 1864 to 1875, widely affecting the four continents of Europe, Asia, America, and Africa; the fifth was from 1883 to 1896; the sixth was from 1902 to 1912, mainly in Asia, Africa, and Southern Europe. Hundreds of years killed people like flies, and the past history is unbearable to read.</p>
<p>But from 1912 to the present, for more than 30 years, cholera has suddenly disappeared in Europe and America, but it still ravages China and India. What is the reason? This is something that should make people think deeply.</p>
<p>When we study the modern history of Europe and America, it is almost impossible to attribute the recent disappearance of cholera to one measure. For example, the implementation of seaport quarantine, the improvement of environmental sanitation, the progress of public education, the rapid investigation and diagnosis, the strict isolation and disinfection, and the promotion of preventive vaccination all have considerable merit. But in the past 30 years or so, if we seek a epoch-making measure to match the phenomenon of the sudden disappearance of cholera, then there is only "drinking water disinfection."</p>
<p>The experiment of using chlorine gas to disinfect public drinking water began in the laboratory of Chicago, USA, in 1906. After several improvements, it was quickly adopted by European and American countries. Since the adoption of drinking water disinfection, there has been no cholera epidemic in the area. Historical facts are such that it cannot be said that this is not the key.</p>
<p>Moreover, the fact that the main route of cholera transmission is water supply is evidenced by numerous historical examples. The history of the epidemics in Hamburg and England is the most notable. Generally speaking, water supply transmission epidemics have the following characteristics that can be identified:</p>
<p>(1) The sick are limited to the contaminated water supply area.</p>
<p>(2) The distribution of cases corresponds to the distribution of the contaminated water supply.</p>
<p>(3) Those who use the water supply can be infected.</p>
<p>(4) If the contamination of the water supply is only in one or two places, the epidemic will usually be explosive.</p>
<p>(5) The water supply is suspected or proven to be contaminated.</p>
<p>(6) Once the water supply is stopped or disinfected, the epidemic will decrease immediately.</p>
<p>Looking back at China, cholera has been epidemic more than 53 times, and it has become more severe in recent years. How many have died from this disease is unknown! China has had tap water facilities for a very short time. Before the war, it was limited to 17 larger cities, and only seven of them used chlorine gas (or bleaching powder) for disinfection. Even these seven places were limited in scale and could not cover the entire city. However, the areas that used disinfected water supply were able to avoid the intrusion of cholera epidemics. How can this be a coincidence! The past is clear, and it is up to those who care to understand and use it!</p>
<p>Cholera prevention work is not limited to water supply disinfection. It requires the cooperation of all sectors of society and multifaceted efforts, as mentioned earlier. But the focus of the work must be clear. The focus and the center are different. Epidemic prevention work can take health education as the center, preventive vaccination as the center, quarantine inspection as the center, isolation and disinfection as the center, investigation of the source of the disease as the center, improvement of environmental sanitation as the center, and treatment of patients as the center. It should be adapted to local conditions and adapted to the times, so that the various epidemic prevention work can get the coordination and connection it deserves to accomplish the task. But the focus of cholera prevention work must be placed on water supply disinfection. The focus is on the points of emphasis and importance. Make every effort and do not neglect it. "To shoot a man, shoot his horse first, to capture a thief, capture the king first." Preventing cholera is also like this. At this time when the whole country is shocked by the cholera epidemic, avoid panicking. May all of us be able to observe the focus with a calm mind and work together to eradicate it with positive action.</p>
<h3 id="e145">Diagnosis First! <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>— Lin Zhaoqi</p>
<p>The primary task of a clinical doctor is diagnosis and treatment. Before a diagnosis is confirmed, the treatment of a disease cannot begin. Therefore, the slogan of clinical doctors is "Diagnosis First," with particular emphasis on "etiological diagnosis." Diagnosis is like a key; without it, one cannot open the "door of treatment" and the "door of prognosis."</p>
<p>In the past decade, there have been epoch-making inventions such as sulfonamides and penicillin, which treat various bacterial infectious diseases, benefiting humanity immensely! No wonder they caused a global sensation, known to both women and children. However, the rational use of specific drugs requires accurate diagnosis; otherwise, one will go in the opposite direction, not only wasting resources but also betraying good medicine, and sometimes even harming the patient! Therefore, although therapeutics has developed rapidly, clinical doctors still regard "Diagnosis First" as the guiding principle.</p>
<p>Diagnostics is the comprehensive application of basic disciplines such as anatomy, physiology, biochemistry, pathology, bacteriology, serology, parasitology, and radiology to each patient case. The patient is alive, and the source of the disease, such as bacteria, parasites, or tumor cells, is also alive. Because of the interaction of these two "living factors," medicine is different from other sciences such as chemistry and physics. Two parts of hydrogen and one part of oxygen will invariably combine to form water, and water has its unchanging properties. Although typhoid bacilli invade the human body and cause typhoid fever, the symptoms of each typhoid patient are not the same, and the occurrence of complications and the prognosis vary greatly. We must understand that the patient's constitution, psychology, nutrition, resistance, age, gender, environment, etc., are different, and the typhoid bacilli have different types, numbers of invasions, and virulence, resulting in complex and even confusing symptoms. In addition to comprehensively applying the above-mentioned basic disciplines, diagnosticians must also use their imagination, discrimination, coordination, and judgment.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, there are the following ten methods for confirming a diagnosis: (1) collecting detailed and precise medical history; (2) conducting a comprehensive physical examination; (3) performing chemical tests on blood, secretions, excretions, transudates, and exudates; (4) using X-ray fluoroscopy; (5) using diagnostic instruments such as esophagoscopes, gastroscopes, bronchoscopes, cystoscopes, sigmoidoscopes, peritoneoscopes, colposcopes, ophthalmoscopes, laryngoscopes, otoscopes, etc.; (6) electrocardiography; (7) basal metabolism measurement; (8) biopsy; (9) exploratory surgery; and (10) autopsy.</p>
<p>The flexible application of the above diagnostic methods depends entirely on the attending physician's ability to choose appropriately according to the patient's condition. For example, in coronary thrombosis, the diagnosis can be confirmed by medical history, symptoms, and electrocardiography. Epidemic meningitis cannot be completely diagnosed without examining the cerebrospinal fluid and blood for cell reactions and bacteria.</p>
<p>From the perspective of diagnosis, diseases can be roughly divided into three categories: (1) diagnoses that are obvious, such as bronchial asthma. Of course, finding the "allergens" that cause bronchial asthma is a most troublesome and often fruitless task. (2) Diagnoses that can only be confirmed after a considerable period of time and research, such as bacterial and serological tests, such as typhoid fever. (3) Sometimes, even after making full use of the most scientific methods, and even after autopsy after the patient's death, a diagnosis cannot be made. This shows that modern scientific medicine has not yet reached perfection and requires the efforts of medical practitioners worldwide, the assistance of other scientific workers, and the encouragement of all humankind.</p>
<p>Human beings possess innate curiosity, a desire for truth, and the joy of cultivation and harvest. In particular, medical and other scientific practitioners regard research and the pursuit of truth as the true meaning and joy of life. Therefore, diagnostics can be said to be the source of the true meaning and joy of life for clinical doctors and the key to medical work. No wonder they loudly proclaim "Diagnosis First!"</p>
<h3 id="e146">Taiwan Tuberculosis Research Program <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>— Mu Yun</p>
<p>Continuing Research and Production of Specific Drugs for Lung Diseases</p>
<p>The "specific drug for lung diseases" invented by a professor at National Taiwan University in Taiwan Province has caused a nationwide sensation. It has not only given great impetus to the scientific and medical communities but also given great excitement to lung disease patients. The reporter made a special trip to interview him and was given the following details:</p>
<p>·From Investigation to Research·</p>
<p>Dr. Chen Lixie was originally a professor at Peiping University Medical College, Northwest Associated University Medical College, and Fujian Medical College. After the retrocession, Director Chen invited him to Taiwan to serve as a professor at National Taiwan University and the director of the Second Affiliated Hospital. He was charged with the mission of investigating Japanese medical research. During his investigation, he first discovered two types of "specific drugs" for lung diseases invented by Japanese professors at National Taiwan University, Katsura Shigehiro (Medical College) and Nozaki Tetsuo (Science College). One is Cepharanthin, a plant belonging to the Menispermaceae family, and the other is L-Rodinsaure, a pure separation of a component of cypress essential oil produced in Taiwan. (Later, there were also hydrogenated additives and lanolin fatty acids discovered by Nozaki.) From a medical point of view, the former has side effects on the treatment of hemoptysis and fever, while the latter has already achieved 20% effectiveness in treating severe lung disease patients. The gradual reduction of tuberculosis bacilli in sputum, the decrease and disappearance of ominous shadows on chest X-rays, the slowing down of erythrocyte sedimentation rate to recovery, and the improvement of other physiological reactions are all good evidence. In the past, the Governor-General invested in research, but after the retrocession, it was suspended like other undertakings. After Dr. Chen discovered it, he reported the information to Director Chen in late February, explaining that it was necessary to continue this research, so he began preparing the research program.</p>
<p>·Treatment Research Program·</p>
<p>After Dr. Chen received the Director's verbal approval for the research, he drafted a program to be submitted to the Director-General's Office for approval within this month. This program tentatively uses NT$1.5 million to NT$2 million as operating funds, and the researchers are eight professors from National Taiwan University, who are responsible for clinical medicine, organic chemistry, pathological anatomy, histology, pharmaceutics, pharmacology, physiology, and bacteriology, respectively, as the main backbone of the Tuberculosis Research Institute. The first phase is preliminary research, the second phase is the establishment of the Research Institute, and the third phase is the expansion of research to establish an experimental hospital. It will borrow the existing facilities of the National Taiwan University Medical College and the First and Second Affiliated Hospitals and employ six to twelve researchers and ten to fifteen associate research assistants.</p>
<p>According to Dr. Chen, although cypress production is high, the extracted components are very small. Only 100 kilograms can be obtained from 100 tons of crude oil. 0.1% is 100 kilograms of Rodinsäure, which is only enough for 1,000 patients for one month. Therefore, at the same time, the dextrorotatory Citronellic Acid obtained from Andropogon nardus and Geranis Acid (also a fatty acid) with a similar structure to Rodinsäure will be mixed together for comparative research, which will be more effective than studying them separately.</p>
<p>·Production Can Begin After March·</p>
<p>Dr. Chen has received letters from many people in the country with remittances to purchase this specific drug. He said with regret: The current stock can only be used for ten patients for half a year. If this program is implemented quickly and there is no problem with the Taiwan Tobacco &amp; Wine Monopoly Bureau's Kosaka Chemical Processing Plant undertaking it, then the previous normal state can be maintained in two or three months, and it can be supplied to the country and Taiwan Province continuously. He firmly believes that cypress oil may one day be scarce, while Andropogon nardus, which is abundant in Taiwan Province, can be used regularly as a supplementary raw material.</p>
<p>In his program, the establishment of sanatoriums is also one of the main undertakings. In the future, research institutes will be established throughout the country, and with the strength of this research institute, a movement to resist and prevent tuberculosis will be launched. He is confident.</p>
<p>Dr. Chen told reporters: Lung disease is a global disease. China is the country with the most lung diseases, ranking first among all human diseases. Therefore, using the existing material resources to achieve success in researching specific treatments is the greatest benefit to mankind! He said with great regret: The pathology of treating pulmonary tuberculosis with fatty acids has not yet been published.</p>
<h3 id="e147">Two Dietary Habits Related to Cholera Transmission <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>— Guo Keda</p>
<p>General preventive measures for cholera have been introduced in the previous issue of this publication. Now, let's discuss two small matters that should be reformed in daily dietary habits:</p>
<p>(1) Fruit Disinfection Method: Generally speaking, fruits are not only delicious and refreshing foods, but more importantly, fresh fruits contain a large amount of vitamins, especially vitamin C. Fruits such as oranges, loquats, and grapes originally grow high on trees or vines and do not come into contact with sewage or feces, so it seems that there are no pathogens attached to the skin. However, there are still the following possibilities: First, flies can carry pathogens to the skin. Second, fruit pickers, especially vendors, often wash them with sewage or ordinary unboiled raw water, so it is easy to attach pathogens to the skin. As for fruits such as water chestnuts and sweet potatoes, they grow in the soil and inevitably have been fertilized with feces, so in addition to attaching pathogens, there may also be parasite eggs and cysts on the skin of these fruits.</p>
<p>As for the disinfection method, people generally believe that there is no problem after peeling the fruit with a knife. In fact, this view is specious. Although peeling with a knife can remove most of the bacteria on the skin, the inner layer of the fruit has been unknowingly contaminated with bacteria during the peeling process. Some housewives habitually wash fruits with cold boiled water, believing that this disinfects them. In fact, this only does the negative aspect, because cold boiled water has no effect on killing the pathogens that already exist on the fruit skin. So this is not a reasonable disinfection method either.</p>
<p>From a scientific point of view, the disinfection of fruits should be done according to two principles: (1) A method should be used to kill the bacteria and parasite eggs on the epidermis; (2) The vitamin content inside the fruit should not be lost. According to these two principles, in cities with developed chemical industries, potassium permanganate and other chlorinated disinfectants can certainly be used to sterilize; however, under the current economic conditions of our country's industry, it cannot be universally applied. A fruit disinfection method that is feasible in our country and conforms to scientific principles is very simple: just soak the fruit in boiling water for about three to five minutes, and the pathogens on the epidermis will be quickly killed. At the same time, treat the knife in the same way, and then use this sterilized knife to peel the fruit, and absolutely avoid touching the freshly peeled pulp with your fingers during the entire operation. Fruits prepared in this way can be said to be no longer likely to cause common gastrointestinal infectious diseases after eating.</p>
<p>(2) Rational Dining Method: Logically, since cholera vibrio cannot withstand high heat and can be killed immediately in an environment of 100 degrees Celsius, there should be no cholera bacteria in cooked or stir-fried hot dishes. However, in reality, this is problematic in our country. In Chinese families, especially in restaurants, the bowls, chopsticks, plates, and dishes used for eating are usually washed with raw water, and sometimes with filthy "dishwater," and after washing, they are wiped dry with a "rag" that is a concentration camp of bacteria. Bowls washed in this way look clean on the surface, but in fact, they spread the bacteria to the entire bowl. Then the bacteria are eaten into the stomach along with the food. As the saying goes, "What the eye doesn't see, the heart doesn't grieve." But if our eyes were replaced with a microscope, it would be frightening, because during a cholera epidemic, just one drop of dirty dishwater can contain thousands of living bacteria! Therefore, this bad habit of washing dishes with cold water or dirty water must be reformed.</p>
<p>In fact, a reasonable washing method is very simple: First, wash the bowls and dishes with ordinary cold or warm water, put them in a pot of water and boil them for about ten minutes, then take them out and wipe them dry with a clean white cloth (preferably a cloth that has been boiled in boiling water and dried). It is absolutely safe from the danger of cholera transmission to eat hot dishes and rice served in bowls and dishes that have been boiled in this way. Therefore, whether in ordinary families or restaurants, all bowls, dishes, chopsticks, etc. used to serve dishes and rice must be boiled in boiling water. Especially in restaurants, we should ask the chef to use freshly boiled hot bowls and utensils to serve the dishes and rice, otherwise, refuse to eat.</p>
<h3 id="e148">Palpitations <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>— Tao Shouqi</p>
<p>Palpitation is the feeling of the heart beating. In fact, as long as a person lives in the world, his heart is constantly beating, but this beating does not usually make us feel it or pay attention to it. The so-called palpitation refers to the meaning of feeling one's own heartbeat. When palpitations occur, the feeling of beating can be limited to the chest or spread to the head or the whole body, often making people feel not only the heartbeat or throbbing but also a general feeling of discomfort, even panic and great discomfort.</p>
<p>The cause of palpitations can be attributed to the individual or combined effects of the following two factors: (1) changes in heartbeats, such as too fast or too slow rate, too strong force, and irregular rhythm; (2) hypersensitivity of nerve sensation. People have different sensitivities to various sensations such as pain, fever, etc., and this is also true for heartbeats. The influence of these two factors is of equal importance, because people with less sensitive sensations do not feel very fast or irregular heartbeats, while those with hypersensitivity may experience palpitations and feel very uncomfortable if the heartbeat is slightly stronger or faster.</p>
<p>Based on the above two reasons, the situations that can cause palpitations can be divided into the following three categories:</p>
<p>The first category can be said to be physiological conditions. When anyone exercises vigorously, the heart beats faster and stronger than usual, and palpitations will result. If people are not accustomed to exercise, because the body parts have not been properly trained to meet the needs of physical exertion, palpitations are more severe when exercising. Similarly, people who are too excited or frightened will also experience palpitations. In addition, it is easy to cause palpitations when energy is exhausted, because on the one hand, the heart itself is prone to beat faster after fatigue, and on the other hand, the nerves become particularly sensitive after fatigue. Almost everyone has experienced this type of palpitation, and it is the most common cause of palpitations. However, because of differences in individual nerve sensitivity, some people are more prone to palpitations than others.</p>
<p>The second category is that in the course of various infectious diseases and feverish diseases without fundamental heart disease, and during the recovery period of many diseases, palpitations are also a common symptom due to accelerated heartbeat or hypersensitivity of nerves.</p>
<p>The third category is diseases of the heart itself. The reason why heart disease produces symptoms of palpitations is sometimes because the heart's action is hindered, and the heart becomes hypertrophied, resulting in strong and fast beating, but sometimes it is because the rhythm of the heartbeat becomes irregular.</p>
<p>From this point of view, most palpitations are either a reaction of normal people to some physiological conditions or occur in the course of diseases that are not directly related to the heart itself. These types of palpitations are temporary and should never be considered a phenomenon of heart disease. As for the few palpitations caused by genuine heart disease, at this time, there must be definite and obvious phenomena of heart disease that can be detected. Therefore, palpitations and heart disease should not be treated the same. If someone has questions about their own "heartbeat," they should find a reliable doctor to examine them in detail to see if they have heart disease. Otherwise, the more you suspect and the more you pay attention, the more sensitive the nerves will become, and the more severe the phenomenon of palpitations will become. Once you develop a fear or misunderstanding of having heart disease, it will be difficult to correct when it is deeply rooted, and you will create a disease where there is no disease. This type of non-genuine heart disease caused by psychological errors is very common, but it should also be avoided.</p>
<h3 id="e149">DDT and Its Usage <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>— Zhang Changshao</p>
<p>This summer, everyone is talking about DDT. The more I hear, the more I feel that accurate reports about this insecticidal wonder drug are not widespread enough, especially regarding its application methods.</p>
<p>DDT is one of the two greatest medical inventions of this war; the other is penicillin. DDT can eradicate all kinds of insects, and it is effective in killing flies, mosquitoes, lice, fleas, and bedbugs, which are the most harmful to humans. Its greatest feature is its residual effectiveness: after one application, the insecticidal effect of DDT can last for days, weeks, or even months. Therefore, DDT is particularly effective against lice crawling on surfaces, fleas hopping around, and bedbugs emerging from cracks. In the first day or two after application, there may still be survivors, but after a few more days, all can be completely eliminated, with no one spared.</p>
<p>To achieve the maximum effect of DDT, appropriate application methods must be adopted according to the type of insect. Currently, many people casually buy a bottle of pesticide on the street and spray a little here and there in the house with a sprayer, which really cannot exert much effect. First, many of the DDT products sold in beer bottles at street stalls are not good quality. Some do not contain enough DDT to meet the standard, and some are simply outright fakes—a bottle of kerosene or gasoline with a DDT label to deceive people out of one or two thousand yuan. Naturally, these inferior and fake products cannot have any effect. Second, even if you buy good DDT, spraying it so casually will not achieve practical results and is almost a waste.</p>
<p>Before discussing accurate usage methods, I must first introduce the properties of DDT, because its special properties determine its usage.</p>
<p>DDT is a transparent crystal or white fine powder, which is extremely stable and not easily spoiled or volatilized and lost. Therefore, once its solution is sprayed on walls or utensils, its insecticidal effect can be maintained for a long time. Because it is insoluble in water, clothing and bedding treated with DDT can still maintain their effectiveness even after repeated washing. Various oils, such as soybean oil, raw oil, vegetable oil, tung oil, etc., as well as various organic solvents that can remove oil stains, such as gasoline, kerosene, vinegar, and alcohol, can dissolve DDT to form a solution. The commonly used DDT solution is its kerosene solution, containing five grams (gm.) of DDT in every hundred cubic centimeters (C.C.).</p>
<p>The insecticidal effect of DDT must also be mentioned. DDT works by paralyzing the nervous system of insects. When insects land on a surface that has been sprayed with the pesticide, DDT is quickly absorbed and becomes toxic. After poisoning, the nerves are initially stimulated, causing erratic flying and movement, followed by paralysis and falling to the ground, and finally, complete paralysis and death. Therefore, it takes a considerable amount of time for DDT to kill insects. The length of this time depends on the concentration of the active ingredient in the solution or powder, the type of insect, and the duration of contact between the insect and the pesticide. If a 5% solution is used, flies and mosquitoes will usually die after about half an hour, while bedbugs will die after several hours or even a day or two.</p>
<p>Many people believe that DDT has an immediate insecticidal effect, and some believe that DDT can keep insects away, but neither is true. Old-fashioned insecticides such as pyrethrum can kill insects immediately, and mosquito repellents used in America emit an odor when applied to the skin, keeping mosquitoes away. Although DDT does not have these two effects, its lasting residual effect can kill insects over a long period, so it has the wonderful advantage of being effective once and for all.</p>
<p>DDT is also quite toxic to humans and animals, so it is important not to spray it on food and utensils. Its solution can also be absorbed through the skin, and excessive absorption can lead to poisoning, so the solution should not be used to wipe the body. However, the powder and emulsion are not absorbed through the skin and can be used to kill various insects on the body, such as head lice, body lice, pubic lice, and fleas. I have introduced the properties of DDT in detail above, and now I can talk about the application methods.</p>
<p>For flying insects such as flies and mosquitoes, the application of DDT cannot completely eliminate flies and mosquitoes in the house unless screens are installed or attention is paid to closing windows. For houses with screened windows and doors, adding DDT can continue to kill insects that accidentally fly in and supplement the lack of strictness of the screened windows and doors. If there are no screening facilities and you cannot pay attention to closing windows, DDT can only reduce but not completely eliminate flies and mosquitoes in the house. The principle of application is to ensure that any surface in the house has traces of the pesticide, so that once mosquitoes and flies enter the house and stop, they will come into contact with the pesticide and die of poisoning. The application can be divided into three methods: spraying, painting, and brushing. The spraying method uses a kerosene solution of DDT, the painting method uses DDT dissolved in tung oil or varnish, and the brushing method uses DDT fine powder closely mixed with glue powder. A concentration of 5% DDT is generally considered the most suitable. Spraying is usually the most convenient method, and the sprayed droplets should be just like drizzle. Sprayers that turn the liquid into a mist, stay in the air, and are not easily absorbed are not suitable. If there is no suitable sprayer, then use a brush to apply the liquid to the ceiling, walls, doors, and windows. When brushing, a mask moistened with water must be worn over the nose and mouth. After brushing, open the windows to allow the solvent to evaporate. It can be inhabited about four hours later. After the solvent evaporates, it leaves white traces of the pesticide, which is especially obvious on glass. Its effect can last for one or two months. The effect of brushing and painting methods can last for about three months. The most important places to apply pesticide in the home are the kitchen and toilet, targeting flies; the second is the place of work and bedroom at night, targeting mosquitoes.</p>
<p>Currently, people generally use fly swatter-style sprayers to spray DDT, spraying a little here and there in the room every night, sometimes spraying at mosquitoes in the air. This sacrifices the characteristics of DDT and forces it to be used as an old-fashioned insecticide such as fly swatters, which is really a waste. Used in this way, it can indeed knock down a few mosquitoes in the room, but the fine mist eventually falls to the ground with dust and cannot exert its lasting effect, which is a pity. Moreover, the effect of this method is not as good as fly swatters, because DDT does not have an immediate insecticidal effect. As for the weak knockdown effect obtained during spraying, it is actually due to the kerosene that dissolves DDT, which has nothing to do with DDT itself. If used every day, people in the room will often inhale the fine mist, which may produce chronic poisoning, which is extremely inappropriate.</p>
<p>For bedbugs, DDT is much more effective than for flies and mosquitoes. The solution is better than the powder. About half a pound of solution is needed for each bed (including the bed frame, mattress, bedding, and pillows) to kill all the bedbugs. One application can last for several months. The mattress and bed frame can be brushed with a cloth dipped in the pesticide solution, while the bedding and pillows can be sprayed with a sprayer to make them slightly damp. After spraying the top, turn it over and spray the bottom. As for the cracks in the bed frame, there is no need to treat them specifically, because when bedbugs come out of the cracks to forage for food, they will come into contact with the pesticide traces on the way and be poisoned, with no chance of escape. Wear a mask during application, and after application, open the windows for ventilation for four hours to allow the kerosene to evaporate before living there.</p>
<p>DDT powder, containing 5% to 10% DDT, is suitable for killing insects such as lice and fleas. Body lice are the vector for transmitting relapsing fever and typhus. The greatest medical contribution of DDT lies in reducing body lice and controlling the prevalence of the above two diseases. Its application belongs to the specialized scope of public health authorities, and I will not elaborate on it here. If an individual finds lice or fleas on their body, DDT powder can be sprinkled on the underwear and worn, and the bedding can also be sprinkled with powder. For head lice and pubic lice, DDT solution must be used to wipe the hair. It should be noted here that DDT solution should not be applied to the body to kill insects, as there is a risk of absorption and poisoning. The powder is safe.</p>

<p>Spring and Autumn</p>
<h3 id="e150">Love of Rivers <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>— Shi Bei</p>
<p>1.  Nanming River</p>
<p>When mentioning the scenery of Guiyang, everyone will not forget the charming Huaxi, but Huaxi is more than twenty miles away from the city. In the city, the only scenic spot, I think, should be the Nanming River. During the turbulent times of war, I spent a winter and an early spring season on the banks of the Nanming River. I appreciated the quiet beauty of the river and the clarity and simplicity of nature.</p>
<p>In the rainy and silent Guiyang, only the Nanming River is bright and lovely. The small river bay is often as calm as a mirror; there are no boats coming and going, and the river water is as clear in all seasons. Only small fishing boats, carrying fishing gear, sway in the heart of the river in twos and threes, like a team.</p>
<p>Next to the river bay in front of the riverside park, a natural swimming pool has been opened. The ancient trees on the riverside are deep and secluded, green reflecting the flowing waves. The long embankment stone road is clean and dust-free. In the hot summer, this place becomes the most worthwhile place to linger in the city.</p>
<p>In winter, I love to see the snow on both sides of the Nanming River. The bright snow reflects on the river surface, which is frozen into a thin layer of ice. The branches by the river are covered with strings of icicles, hanging upside down as if about to fall. The reflection of the snow-covered new bridge is just like a picture of bitter cold antiquity.</p>
<p>That winter, it snowed heavily for several consecutive days. Every morning, in the vibrant morning air reflected by the sparkling snow, I would walk along the Nanming River to the mountains of the riverside park to step on the snow. When I returned, I would also go to see if the snowman that I and the children had built was damaged.</p>
<p>Now I have left that place for several years. When can I return to the Nanming River to find the traces of snow from that day?</p>
<p>2.  Jialing River</p>
<p>Jialing River, this beautiful and crisp name, many people have infinite love and longing for her. Like a ribbon, not too big or too small, she flutters among the mountains and rivers of Bashu. Beside Chongqing, she gives this noisy mountain city a lot of tranquility and gentle adjustment.</p>
<p>During the foggy season, the white fog covers the mountains and rivers. Standing by the river, watching the fog gradually dissipate, the river scenery gradually unfolds before your eyes. Sails emerge from the fog and slowly move closer. If the thick fog persists for a long time in the morning, you stand on the riverbank, and you can't even see the shadow of the pier. Only very sparse and slow oars strike the water. The vast sea of fog swallows everything. At this time, you try to hire a small boat, carefully shake it away, and float with the light swinging of the side of the ship, it really feels like a god traveling on the clouds.</p>
<p>The clearest time for the Jialing River is in the spring. Wheat and broad beans on both sides of the river exude fragrance. The beach under Jinyun Mountain is the most ideal place for spring suburban horse riding. Tourists who go to Beibei Hot Spring ride horses and chase after each other on the horse riding field here.</p>
<p>In summer and autumn, the Jialing River rises, which is said to be the busiest season for boatmen to transport goods. Early in the morning, the songs of the boatmen and trackers flutter on the riverbank. Under the scorching sun, these hardworking and strong sons of the river are all naked, and their natural strength and boldness remain on the beach where their footprints have stepped.</p>
<p>When winter comes, the Jialing River sinks into the foggy season again.</p>
<p>I love the Jialing River as I love the days I spent by the river. I have been living by the river for a year, and I have not left her for a day during this time. Every evening, I walk by the river, watching the sails in the heart of the river return with the sunset, and watching the evening star on the river, shining with the first degree of light...</p>
<p>The love of rivers is deep and sincere. I love rivers as I love the shining and clear life. For this reason, I know how to find a simple life. Rivers, I want to sing for you!</p>
<h3 id="e151">Random Notes from Prison (4) <a href="#e151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>— Yao Che</p>
<p>Handling a case requires investigation and prosecution by the prosecutor, repeated trials by the judge, investigation of evidence, and defense by the lawyer. If the judge's judgment is unfair, the prosecutor can also file an appeal, and if the parties are dissatisfied, they can also appeal layer by layer... It can be said that it is very complete. I often wonder why so many unreasonable facts still occur. I found that the people's level of knowledge is too low. Many kind old people are simply ignorant of the law, and the law is so complicated, like a net, that they will bump into it if they are not careful. At this time, they are at a loss and are at the mercy of others, or accidentally violate the law, or fall into a "three-character unjust case."</p>
<p>At the same time, I also deeply feel that the law is the most flexible thing, and it is not as rigid and impartial as ordinary people imagine.</p>
<p>Here, a prisoner sentenced to death does not necessarily die, while a person who has been declared innocent has already been imprisoned for three to five years, or even died of illness in prison.</p>
<p>Therefore, here, people deeply believe in a thing called "fate" and believe that it is irresistible.</p>
<p>Here, people's way of dealing with "fate" is first to "rely on" - this is a reflection of "one character in the court, nine cattle can't pull it out," I don't think it needs to be explained any further; the second is to "delay." If your lawsuit is not sure to win, you delay the time (appeal is one way of "delaying"), so that people can't find a handle, and it will end by itself. Moreover, as time drags on, people change, and the "victim" is gone. If no one is against you, you can find a way to get bail.</p>
<p>But is "fate" really irresistible? I have seen someone slip out of her hands...</p>
<p>Expectation of Freedom</p>
<p>In recent days, I have been looking forward to regaining my freedom.</p>
<p>However, this period of expectation is the most difficult to endure. A person who has been wronged and lost his freedom, once he hears that the wrong can be redressed and he can see the light of day again, his mood is of course a burst of excitement, but this excitement cannot last long. After a burst of excitement, it is followed by mixed feelings, and, as one day passes after another, he cannot immediately step out of the threshold of this spiritual prison. This situation is unbearable for even a minute.</p>
<p>I deeply feel that a person who is imprisoned, the period of time when he first comes in and the period of time when he is about to go out are the most difficult to get through.</p>
<p>When a person is brought down from the free world into prison, his freedom is deprived, and everything is restricted. Just like a tiger trapped in a cage, he feels infinite pain. If he has been wronged, he is even more full of anger and grievance, which is constantly tormenting his heart and cannot be suppressed. When he is too excited, he even wants to die, using death as a complaint against his injustice. Therefore, every prison pays special attention to new prisoners.</p>
<p>However, this period of time is short and easy to get through, because people are the most adaptable animals. As long as they spend ten days or a week, they will gradually get used to this difficult life. Moreover, if you look around at the people who are in the same difficulty as you, you can find that there are many who are more wronged than you, which also helps you to dilute your feelings of injustice. At the same time, you still have hope. You believe that you will not be convicted without guilt, and you still have to use all your heart and energy to find a way to clear your injustice, so you temporarily suppress your anger. Although in the long sleepless nights, when you think more and more angrily, until you can't relieve it, an impulse to commit suicide will inevitably surge in your heart, but this is easy to overcome, because you have a reason not to die. Because your injustice has not yet been redressed, you are not willing to do such a stupid thing that hurts your loved ones and pleases your enemies.</p>
<p>Even if you are wrongly convicted and sentenced to live here for ten or eight years, that is not a big deal. Of course, you are very sad when you receive the judgment, but since you have done everything you can, you can no longer resist the control of this "fate." At the same time, this matter can be considered to have a result - although it is an unfortunate result - you don't have to worry about it anymore, and you breathe a sigh of relief. Moreover, you are already used to the life here. So, you have to pack up your wounded heart, bury hope deeply along with injustice and anger, completely isolate yourself from the outside world, forget the days, and live in a muddle-headed way. Time passes quickly. Although you feel that one day is as long as a year, if you look back occasionally, a year is like a day.</p>
<p>But when you always hear that you have encountered a general amnesty, or have been declared innocent, and will soon be able to regain your freedom. At this time, a commotion starts again in your heart. The emotion is quite chaotic and complex at first. You are so excited that you can't speak. You don't know whether to laugh or cry. Your eyes are full of tears of excitement. You sit down and try to calm down this passion, but you also want to walk around and tell anyone about this uncontainable joy.</p>
<p>Day after day. Every morning when you wake up, you have a hope: "Can I go out today!" You go to the wooden gate from time to time and look out from the square window hole. People are still doing their own things as usual, and it seems that no one cares about your mood. Perhaps you want to find someone to talk to about your good news; but the other party only answers faintly: "Maybe it will be soon?" It's hard to get through this long day, and there's no movement at all. In the evening, you reopen the bedding that you have packed and prepared to go out, sigh, fall on the bed, and start many thoughts again...</p>
<p>In these days, your hope has risen again. You think of home, you think of relatives and friends, you think of the future of your career, you think of everything... When you think of happy things, you smile, and when you think of sad things, you cry... At this time, you think of everything you have suffered in these days, thinking from beginning to end. Thinking of being framed by others, resulting in imprisonment and suffering, causing damage to your family, affecting your career, your time, energy, and economy have suffered irreparable losses, all your life's efforts have been destroyed, and even your closest and loved ones have also suffered because of this... Thinking of this, you will feel that your injustice is incomparably great, and you will feel that your hatred is incomparably deep. You have never thought so thoroughly as you do now, although your injustice has now been redressed.</p>
<p>When you think angrily at night, you will clench your fists and hit the bed angrily, thus waking up the cellmate sleeping next to you. If the enemy is right in front of you, you would punch him to death, and be willing to sacrifice the freedom you are about to gain as the price of revenge, without the slightest care.</p>
<p>I am looking forward to the arrival of freedom with the greatest ability! (End)</p>
<h3 id="e152">Also Talking About Qu Yuan <a href="#e152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>— Yuan Shanyuan</p>
<p>For the Poet's Day, many places have talked about Qu Yuan. I haven't read each person's talk in detail, so I don't know much. But I also have some opinions, so I might as well add my two cents and talk about it here.</p>
<p>Perhaps the public sympathizes with Qu Yuan's suicide. Naturally, I also sympathize with him. However, I absolutely do not approve of his suicide, let alone such a weak suicide.</p>
<p>I admire the Confucian spirit of "knowing it cannot be done, yet doing it anyway." Why couldn't he have known it could not be done, yet done it anyway? If the goal was to win the sympathy of future generations, knowing it couldn't be done and doing it anyway could have achieved that, not to mention that the result would have been more than just winning the sympathy of future generations! For some annoyance, "hanging oneself in a ditch," causing pain to loved ones and joy to enemies, is really not worth it!</p>
<p>If things in the world are truly impossible, and death is inevitable, and suicide is unavoidable, then one should indeed find one or two people who deserve to die and can be killed, and fight to the death with them, perishing together. The modern Mrs. Dewey (?) once said, "I won't commit suicide. If I were to commit suicide, I would kill a few people who deserve to be killed first." This saying, I think, could also be generally applied in ancient times. "I will perish with you!" is an expression of this spirit.</p>
<p>Since Qu Yuan's suicide, the impact left behind can be said to be very bad. For more than two thousand years, Chinese literati have never wanted to cheer up. Whenever they encounter setbacks, they only have that pitiful appearance of "looking haggard" and "wandering by the riverside." Then, if they don't jump into the water like Qu Yuan, they often vomit blood and die. In modern times, we no longer need this kind of literati!</p>
<p>Modern literati, if they encounter a fate as bad as Qu Yuan's, being harmed by their colleagues and unable to develop their ambitions, there is no need to grieve at all, especially no need to commit suicide! Do what you can, little by little. If this path doesn't work, there are other paths. Anyway, it's serving society and serving the country. Personal honor and disgrace can be put aside. Grieving or committing suicide is just making too much of oneself, focusing on petty squabbles. Instead, one forgets the mission one should bear.</p>
<p>If the Grand Master Shangguan and Jin Shang and their ilk are truly incorrigible, and you are not the only one suffering from them, but many people, and many people are helpless, then you can also use the spirit of suicide to resolutely get rid of them! "Bees have venom, let alone humans!" I don't believe a literatus is truly so weak that he has no strength to truss a chicken! If one truly has no strength to truss a chicken and cannot strike with one blow, then there is still a "three-inch tongue that won't rot" and a "three-inch pen that doesn't obey the rules." Why wouldn't verbal attacks and written criticisms have some effect! If not, even bumping into his door to die is more meaningful than quietly jumping into the water.</p>
<p>Now that the times have arrived, we no longer need Qu Yuan-style literati; a madman who "splatters the king with neck blood within five steps" is something we yearn for. Modern literati should cheer up: "Respond to bad sounds!" "An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth!" As long as this revenge is not purely for personal gain.</p>
<p>Qu Yuan has been dead for more than two thousand years, so let him pass like that. We sympathize with him, but it's not worth praising him excessively, lest we praise out some problems and cause modern literati to cry and wail and act ugly when they are upset, and finally "die from rash actions!"</p>

<p>(D) Further Governing and Utilizing the Yellow River</p>
<p>Construction of Reservoirs in the Upper Reaches of Tributaries: We know that in the North, not only does the Yellow River have frequent floods, but also the tributaries of the Yellow River can frequently cause disasters, as exemplified by the Luo River mentioned earlier. And these waters, in April and May, often dry up, leaving only a riverbed. Such rivers, of course, only bring harm and no benefit. If reservoirs can be built in appropriate places in the upper reaches of each tributary, then the banks of these tributaries will only benefit and not suffer. We know that in the North, there is mostly snow in winter, especially on the higher mountain peaks and shady slopes, which often only melt in March and April. If the water from the melting snow can be stored in reservoirs, and slowly released in the driest seasons of May and June to irrigate the downstream, it will greatly reduce the disasters caused by drought. And in late summer and early autumn, when heavy rains come and mountain floods break out, each reservoir should store as much water as possible to reduce the water storage burden on the Yellow River sluices. In this way, it can both prevent drought and control floods, so that the areas through which each tributary flows will be benefited. Water is indeed something that cannot be ignored in governing the Yellow River.</p>
<p>(II) Construction of Large Forests: Everyone is familiar with the potential of forests to regulate water and drought. In ancient times, the mountainous areas of North China were covered with forests. Due to the fact that people only knew how to cut down trees indiscriminately without replanting, they have all become barren mountains. Now, there is a plan to build a large horizontal forest in the northern parts of Shanxi, Shaanxi, and Gansu, as well as in Chahar North and Suiyuan South. If this forest passes through the upper reaches of the Yellow River basin, then the floods and droughts of the Yellow River and its tributaries will surely decrease day by day. In modern times, it is not impossible to use scientific methods to pump water for irrigation and to plant trees on barren mountains. Therefore, I believe that if a large forest, several miles deep and thousands of miles long, can be artificially created in these areas, then not only will the Yellow River flood be permanently quelled, but the drought in the North can also be solved. However, this arduous task cannot be completed in a short period of time.</p>
<p>(III) Irrigation Plan for the Lower Reaches of the Yellow River: The North China Plain often suffers from drought in May and June. Since the Yellow River is the only large river in North China, its water should be fully utilized for irrigation. In the past, Jia Rang suggested using diversion canals to irrigate the Hebei region. Now, this method can be further applied using scientific and technological techniques. I believe that a canal should be dug on both the north and south sides of the Yellow River. The northern one should run along the Taihang Mountains to the Yi River; the southern one should run vertically through the rivers in southern Henan to the Huai River. Usually, these two canals should maintain a certain amount of water to facilitate transportation. In times of drought, sluices should be used to control the water of the Yellow River and divert it into these two canals to increase the water volume in the canals. In addition, ditches should be dug along both sides of the canals to facilitate irrigation. Then, the water conservancy in the North will surely achieve greater and more significant results due to the opening of these two canals.</p>
<p>(IV) Design of New Canals Near Xitao: "The Yellow River causes a hundred harms, but only enriches Wuyuan." This old saying is indeed very accurate; because in the area near Wuyuan, people have dug many canals to divert river water for irrigation, which has turned the area into a heavenly palace beyond the border. Now, there is a plan to dig a new canal from the Zehekou in Wuyuan, all the way to the north of Baotou. On both sides of this new canal, several branch canals will be dug vertically and horizontally. And at the intersection of the new canal and the Yellow River, new-style sluices will be built to control the water volume. Then, millions of acres of land on both sides of this new canal can be irrigated, and its economic value will be more beneficial than the Minsheng Canal created by diverting water from the Dahei River near Salaqi.</p>
<p>(V) Water Pumping Project and Irrigation North of Yinshan: I remember that before World War II, when the Soviet Union was immersed in implementing the Five-Year Plan, because the water volume of the Moscow River was too small to allow larger ships to reach Moscow directly, they installed a set of the world's largest water pumps to draw water from a river dozens of miles north of Moscow to increase the water volume of the Moscow River, so that larger warships could reach Moscow directly. Now, north of the Yinshan Mountains in Suiyuan Province, there is a "black soil belt" that has always been overlooked. This black soil, which is rare in the Yellow River basin, has been abandoned due to the inability to obtain water sources. The distance between the Yinshan Mountains and the Yellow River adjacent to this black soil belt is only about twenty or thirty miles. If a river channel can be dug from the Yellow River to the north to the southern foot of the Yinshan Mountains, the water of the Yellow River can be diverted to the southern foot of the Yinshan Mountains. Then, a set of huge water pumps can be installed there to draw water from this river channel, pass it through the Yinshan Mountains, and reach the black soil belt in Beili. The Yinshan Mountains are extremely rich in coal, almost everywhere, which can be developed nearby as a power source for the water pumps. Once the black soil belt obtains this water source, several channels can be dug to store this water for irrigation. Then, the hundreds of miles of black soil plains in the two counties north of Yinshan, which have been abandoned for thousands of years, will be well irrigated and may become the best farmland in North China. This water conservancy project, which saves labor, costs little, and yields great benefits, has not been noticed by anyone until now, and should be brought up for discussion.</p>
<p>(E) Appendix (Discussion on the Yellow River Governance Plan Proposed by Mr. Yang Mengming)</p>
<p>Recently, I read the article "Turning Water Disasters into Water Conservancy" by Mr. Yang Mengming, published in the Shen Bao on May 10th, and I feel that there are many places that deserve discussion. Therefore, I have recorded my humble opinions below for reference in governing the Yellow River.</p>
<p>(I) Mr. Yang believes that the main cause of the Yellow River's disasters is "excessive sediment, which leads to siltation in the lower reaches." I dare not agree with this statement. Major rivers in the world often have floods. For example, the Mississippi River and its tributaries in the United States have flooded many times in history, washing away farmland and houses, sometimes covering several states. The reason is that there is too much rainfall in the basin, the river water level rises sharply, and the river channel cannot contain it, which causes the land on both sides to be submerged. Another example is the flooding of the Nile River, which is caused by the seasonal tidal winds from the Arabian Sea blowing regularly to the vicinity of Abyssinia, creating a rainy season. As a result, the flow of the Blue Nile and the White Nile increases sharply, and the downstream channel cannot contain it, which leads to flooding; because the rainfall is regular, the flooding is also regular, so the Egyptians benefit from the flooding. In fact, the main cause of the Yellow River's disasters is also the heavy rains that occur in the basin in June and July, which cause the water level to rise sharply; as for "excessive sediment," this is just a secondary cause of the flooding.</p>
<p>(II) Mr. Yang advocates that the key to governing the Yellow River lies in changing its course, so as to reduce sediment and make it similar to the Yangtze River. This point must be discussed: First, according to the river course proposed by Mr. Yang, which advocates that the upper reaches pass through the valleys of the Wushu Mountains and divert the water of the Yellow River into the Wei River, can this method of rectification reduce the amount of yellow sand entering the Wei River through Wushu? From the Lower Sancha Kou to Shaanxi, the terrain of the Sancha Kou is steep, the water flow will be rapid, and the soil quality in Guanzhong is also composed of loess. It will inevitably cause a lot of erosion. Compared with the original river course, the degree of sediment is probably not significantly reduced. Second, the project of excavating the Wushu Mountains is too large, and the current Chinese economic strength cannot bear it. Third, due to the uncertain water volume of the Yellow River, if it flows through the Guanzhong Plain for 400 miles when the water rises, it will inevitably be difficult to prevent floods. In this way, the flood that originally did not need to be prevented in the upper reaches will now require an extra layer of prevention.</p>
<p>(III) Mr. Yang advocates that the rectification of the lower reaches of the Yellow River should involve diverting the Yellow River into the Huai River, and then from the Huai River through the vicinity of the East China Sea to the sea. In this way, the total course will increase by about 200 miles compared to the original river. First, it flows from southeast to the Huai River, and then turns northeast to the sea. Since the distance has increased and there are many bends, it is impossible to achieve the "smooth and direct flow" that Mr. Yang mentioned. Mr. Yang put forward "smooth and direct flow" as the key to rectifying the lower reaches of the Yellow River, and this statement is indeed to the point; however, from Zhongmu to Fengtai, the area passed through is the loosest and lowest loess plain. It is not easy to make it "smooth"; because the terrain is too flat, even if the Yellow River has a normal flow, sediment is still very likely to accumulate; once there is sediment, the riverbed will inevitably become shallower, and the river channel will inevitably become higher, so how can it be "smooth"? And Mr. Yang believes that diverting the Yellow River into the Huai River can make it "directly flow" into the sea. However, he does not know that once the Yellow River enters the Huai River, the tributaries in the upper reaches of the Huai River will inevitably have no choice but to return to the Yellow River; these tributaries, as Mr. Yang said, can become water disasters like the "sand river"; because when the Yellow River floods, it is also when the Huai River and these tributaries flood; so, combining the water of the Yellow River with the Huai River, wouldn't it make the water disasters of the Huai River even more serious? The course has increased by 200 miles, and it is impossible to make it "smooth and direct." On the contrary, there are 200 more miles of flood-prone areas. Wouldn't that be counterproductive! Moreover, changing the river course is no easy task. Not to mention the difficulty of excavating the Wushu Mountains, the section from Zhongmu through Fengtai to the Huai River also requires digging a new river, which is also a considerable project. According to recent actual surveys, the old channel of the Yellow River has only silted up by two to one-and-a-half inches. If it is dredged, it will not be laborious or costly, and it can also achieve twice the result with half the effort.</p>
<p>(IV) Mr. Yang said that after the Yellow River changes its course, the Yellow and Huai rivers will merge, so that large ships can sail directly to Zhoujiakou in the lower reaches of the Yellow River, making it a commercial port equal to Hankou; this point also needs to be discussed: because the water volume of the Yellow River is generally much smaller than that of the Yangtze River. Except for the sudden increase in water volume during large floods, its water volume in other periods is only equivalent to a tributary of the Yangtze River; this is a natural shortcoming, and even if the river course is changed, it will not help; therefore, under the circumstances of limited water volume, it is almost impossible for giant ships to sail directly to Zhoujiakou.</p>
<p>The author saw Mr. Yang's article and felt that there were many places that had to be brought up for discussion, so he hurriedly wrote this article. Because there are not many reference materials at hand, it is inevitable that there will be omissions and errors. Please give me your guidance. (The End)</p>

<p>— Zhao Qingge</p>
<p>Why didn't Boss Liao fire Bao Ling too? First, because he cherished her as a descendant of a scholarly family, and he and Master Mo had some dealings in the past. Second, Bao Ling not only did the accounting work, but also helped Liao Dong with his studies. Bao Ling was earning one salary and doing two jobs. This matter made the Madam even more dissatisfied. Although Boss Liao explained the above reasons to her, the Madam was even angrier. The Madam's anger came from jealousy. She felt that Boss Liao kept Bao Ling entirely for the sake of Liao Dong. In her opinion, Liao Dong should drop out of school and do the accounting work at Hui Chun Tang. This would save the expense of an accountant and the expense of Liao Dong's schooling. It would be a double win, and nothing could be better. However, Boss Liao was unwilling to do so. Boss Liao's affection for Liao Dong was favoritism towards the son of the previous wife; favoritism towards the son of the previous wife meant that he still loved the previous wife; according to this logic, although the son of the previous wife was now under her control; and the previous wife had long turned into dirt; she still couldn't help but feel jealous! This kind of subconscious psychological abnormality was something she couldn't realize herself. This is also a common phenomenon among wives who remarry. They can't explain it themselves, and others can't understand their complex and subtle emotions.</p>
<p>After the Madam developed a prejudice against Boss Liao, she hated Liao Dong even more! Liao Dong's every move aroused the Madam's disgust! Although Liao Dong was extremely careful and restrained, he couldn't please the Madam. Because of this, Liao Dong suddenly realized one day, and he said to Bao Ling very painfully:</p>
<p>"It seems that only if I am not in this family, will my stepmother be happy, and will my family be peaceful!"</p>
<p>"Yes!" Bao Ling said. She couldn't help but secretly admire Liao Dong's intelligence. "What you said is absolutely correct, unless you let her forget your existence, she will live contentedly, and you can improve yourself!"</p>
<p>Bao Ling's inspiration gave Liao Dong a deeper awakening, and at the same time, he began to sprout the same idea as Bao Ling—to leave home! He was thinking of trying to "stand up," but he wasn't far from learning to "walk"! How easy would it be? Where would he go after leaving home? He was still very young! So he was at a loss and became even more sad!</p>
<p>The Madam also suddenly became clever. She came up with a win-win solution that could compensate for all the losses on Liao Dong's body. She happily told Boss Liao about this brilliant plan. She said in a very kind tone. .</p>
<p>"Dong'er is already twelve years old, and he will be fifteen next year. It's time to pay attention to his marriage. I want to find him a child bride, first because I am busy with Liang'er all day and can't take care of Dong'er. Finding a girl who is a little older than Dong'er can take care of him, and you will save yourself worry. Second, when the guys are all fired, there will be a shortage of manpower to do chores at home. Dong'er still has to go to school and can't do anything. If he has a wife, she can help us take care of the housework. It's always more considerate and reliable than someone hired from the outside. Moreover, people hired from the outside will only help you for three to five years at most, but your own wife can help you for a lifetime." The Madam spoke a lot of principles in a serious manner. At first, Boss Liao didn't quite agree, but after thinking about it, he found it quite reasonable, so after considering it for a while, he readily agreed.</p>
<p>"Okay! But where can I find a suitable matchmaker?"</p>
