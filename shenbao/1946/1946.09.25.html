<h3>主席巡視贛南建設　昨偕王陵基等蒞臨贛縣　行前指示南昌黨團工作</h3>
<p>〔本報南昌廿四日電〕蔣主席二十四日晨飛贛州，赴機塲前經過南昌市區時，棄其國滬「一一四三二」轎車，改立於憲兵團之敞篷吉普車上，對沿途竚立恭送備極依戀之萬千市民，揮帽點苜，含笑答禮，自省府至飛機塲前，歡呼雷動，車抵機塲，各界首長及民衆代表耆紳均列隊肅立恭候，主席下車，一一握手，並稱謝謝，行抵飛機美齡號前，再與各歡送人員道別後，即漫步登機，頃刻馬達發動，機身冉冉凌空，主席猶於窗中揮手示謝，隨行者有贛主席王陵基。蔣經國·兪濟時·曹聖芬·沈昌煥及行總贛分署長蔡孟堅等，聞主席不擬在贛州久留，即飛廣州巡視。</p>
<p>〔中央社南昌廿四日電〕蔣主席對江西建設，關懷備至，特於二十四日上午十時一刻，偕贛主席王陵基乘專機飛贛縣，視察新贛南建設。前任贛南行政專員多年之蔣經國，於最九時五分應召飛此恭迎。主席行前曾巡視省黨部，靑年團支團部，對黨團工作有所指示。旋乘綠色吉普車赴機塲，由憲兵八團李團長駕駛，沿途經過各街衢，萬千民衆夾道歡送，目睹主席丰采，莫不欣喜若狂，歡聲雷動，高呼「元首萬歲」。十時許吉普將進機塲時，主席即行下車，而省會，黨，政，軍各界人士及耆紳民衆多人，早已在塲恭送，主席步入機塲，頻向歡送人員點首示謝，旋與耆紳歐陽武等握手，及至飛機門首，復向歡送人員揮帽吿別，專機十時十五分昇空南飛，十一時許可抵贛縣。又主席昨上午曾巡視贛民廳，訓示李應長努力工作，輔助王主席建設新江西，使成爲模範省。</p>
<p>〔又電〕主席廿四日晨與江西各界歡送者千餘人含笑作別後，即飛贛州，十一一時半抵贛州機塲，贛州民衆聞主席之蒞止，情緒熱烈，不下南昌。主席在中正公園稍事休息後，下午四時偕蔣經國等步行至陽明書院，憑弔此一代哲人之遺蹟，沿途民衆環繞歡呼，歷久不散。主席旋至八井台觀章。貢二江合流處，欣賞久之，復渡江至虎崗參觀兒童新村，正氣中學，新村兒童及正氣中學學生一千餘人鳴鑼鼓鞭砲相迎，主席含笑答禮，常召見徐局長昌鏻，垂詢該村組織及兒童進修情形，對該村管理完善，秩序良好，備致嘉勉。</p>
<h3>陳總長邀宴司使　桂永淸皮宗敢亦曾往訪　傳政府允考慮三人復會</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿四日電〕政治商談，表面上似在期待蔣主席返京始有進展，但亦有若干跡象顯示政府方面似有另一種轉變，或在某種容忍下，考慮共產黨之態度。廿四日行動方面，僅下午五時海車副總司令桂永淸往訪司徒大使，六時左右國府參軍皮宗敢與二時由平到京之饒伯森前後到達美大使館，訪問司徒大使。七時半司徒大使應陳總長之邀，偕其私人顧問傳涇波赴宴，並有兪大維。張厲生作陪，衆信此種動態，可能爲政府代表在主席返京前，對於軍事三人會議進行研究之暗示。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社南京廿四日電〕據司徒雷登大使左右談稱：皮宗敢本日午後通吿司徒大使，謂蔣主席已應中共要求，考慮召開三人小組會議之可能性。此乃政府方面之新讓步，以免現行談判最後失敗。</p>
<p>〔聯合社南京廿四日電〕中共方面今日聲稱：除非馬歇爾特使與司徒雷登大使從蔣主席取得停戰保證，否則和平談判仍將陷於停頓云。周恩來仍在上海，等待政府或美方允諾：（一）立即下令停戰，或（二）召開三人小組會議，討論全面停戰。中共發言人王炳南表明，延安已放棄其停戰不附條件之主張，謂三人小組必須決定停戰之條件。王氏又稱：司徒大使及馬特使曾允一俟中共加入政治協議，即「試圖」促成停戰，中共則欲以「保證」替代「試圖」一詞，謂根據過去經騐，允諾尙嫌未足，必須有一保證。</p>
<h3>曾琦月底來滬</h3>
<p>認局勢不致長久拖延</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕左舜生語記者，曾琦現尙在平，來滬日期大約在月底左右。李璜今日當可到滬。</p>
<p>〔中央社北平廿三電〕平市黨部廿三日下午假該部大禮堂茶會，歡迎靑年黨領袖曾琦，曾氏偕該黨中委劉東岩出席，由吳主委鑄人致詞介紹後，曾氏起立致詞，首述此次赴東北視察，目睹敵人諸種建設規模宏大，而此種建設悉賴中國之人力，物力，財力，益見中國地大物博，若能決心從事建設，則國父之實業計劃及蔣主席中國之命運所列各點，均不難實現。而民國卅五年來，建設成績難滿人心，其原因即因中國戰亂頻仍，政潮屢起，而內亂之廓淸，胥賴一部完善可行之憲法，良以憲法制定，則國是有一定之軌道可循。次談及靑年黨十主張爲國家主義，民主政治，社會政策，而其特性有三，即建　性，獨立性，綜合性，故自成立廿三年以來，並無駭人聽聞之行動表現，然經歷廿餘年，猶能屹然獨立，實因該黨適合客觀環境之需要所致。曾氏最後並强調指出目前世界各國人心厭亂，而中國人民望治之心尤切，故目前局勢雖屬黯淡，但戰亂絕難長此拖延，渠信一年以內，光明即可到來，和平即能實現，曾氏定廿四日飛京。</p>
<h3>京杭直達車　下月起開行</h3>
<p>京滬間增金陵號車</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿四日電〕京滬路局定十月一日起開京杭直達快車，京滬間並增「金陵」號快車，每晨自滬開，當日返滬。</p>
<h3>改裝輕便快車　平漢試行成功</h3>
<p>〔本報漢口廿四日電〕平漢路改裝輕便快車，試行成功，自漢至鄭，僅需十六小時，較普通車少去十小時左右。</p>
<h3>財政部國庫司　有裁撤兩科說</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿四日電〕財部國庫司所屬第四·第八兩科有裁撤說，被裁人員將達五十八人。</p>
<h3>國防會三委會　連日舉行會議</h3>
<p>詳商給付戰前存款事</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿四日常〕國防最高委會之經濟，財政，法制三委員會，自廿三日起舉行會議，聞對戰前存款之給付，將作最詳盡之硏究，廿四日整日尙在商討中，俟有決定，再送呈國防最高委會核准。</p>
<h3>首都金鈔價波動</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿四日電〕京市金鈔價，因受匯率將放長謠傳及上海上升影響，廿四日亦有波動，美鈔收三八零零，出四零零零，較廿三日軋升二百元。金便尙穩，最高價爲廿四萬，漲六千元。</p>
<h3>郵資將實行調整　上月虧損總數逾百億元</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿四日電〕據熟悉郵政情形者談：郵局近來虧損極鉅，上月份由於調整待遇等原因，赤字總數在百億以上，雖有政府貼補，然終非久計，因之，增加郵資乃屬必要，惟郵資調整與其他公用事業費漲價情形不同，蓋郵資係郵政法所規定，遇有調整，須先經立法院通過，或經最高常局特准，其時期恐須在十一月份左右，惟亦可能用增加附加費等數法調整，或先加後再加追認。至郵資調整後，究將加至多少，現尙不可知，惟根據成本合計，平信須加至四百元或五百元，始可彌補，將來實際增加數，或不致如此之高。</p>
<h3>四川巴縣民衆　共祝主席榮慶</h3>
<p>將呈獻縣圖地毯</p>
<p>〔中央社重慶廿四日電〕巴縣民衆，爲恭祝主席今年六旬榮慶，特向中國毛織廠定製上繪巴縣地圖之地毯一幅，獻呈主席，用以崇功報德，並作永久紀念。該毯刻已製就，於巴縣參議會中公開展覽，日內再運渝展覽一日後，即派專員運京獻呈。</p>
<h3>政府定十月二日　頒布國大召集令</h3>
<p>選舉事務所促各黨派速提名單</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿四日電〕國大選舉事務所廿四日晨正式發出催促各黨派提出名單之通知，該項通知由張厲生具名，因張氏爲該所負責人，通知中請各黨派於十月初旬提出名單，政府並將於十月二日正式頒布國大於十一月十二日召開之召集令。記者旋分訪各黨派人士，靑年黨方面稱：曾琦尙未抵京，餘無代表留京。</p>
<p>民盟梁漱溟稱：時局如此混亂，如何能開會，民盟對國大一事，將不作考慮，並將正式答覆政府政協代表。共黨發言人廖承志則稱：吾人將重申過去對國大之態度，政府旣未能停戰，又未照政協決議執行，共黨將不受此種國大約束。</p>
<p>記者五時在國民大會堂，曾見陳中委果夫偕同國大籌備會副主任委員洪蘭友及葉秘書等正巡視會堂宣示籌備會對大會之布置正積極進行中。</p>
<p>又政協秘書長雷震，廿四日上午曾訪民盟梁漱溟，所談甚廣，雷·梁兩氏對時局之看法，均認目前已趨明朗，不日可見分曉。</p>
<h3>綏東收復興和縣　傅作義在平會議畢返綏</h3>
<p>〔中央社北平廿四日電〕據確息，綏東陶林豐鎭集寧等縣，先後克復，其軍事衝要之興和縣（共軍盤據地），昨經國軍收復，並爲減除平津之威脅，已向東推進。又沽源二四兩區，亦經收復，繼續開展中。</p>
<p>〔本報北平廿四日電〕傅作義今日上午十時四十分忽忽乘機離平，渠於歸途中將視察解圍後之大同，並可能即在大同或集寗一帶，佈署平綏路西段國軍向張家口推進事宜。傳昨晚秘密來平後，八時半赴行營參加軍事會議，討論自東西方打通平綏路事宜，聞參加會議者有李宗仁，孫連仲，王鴻韶，宋肯堂，徐康良等。</p>
<p>〔本報北平廿四日電〕日前平市盛傳國軍今日起進軍張家口，並限月底收復張家口，惟今日截至發電時止，靑龍橋方面尙無戰訊傳來。據悉，各參加戰鬥部隊，尙未到達預定地區，故今日戰事，並未開始。但一般判斷，進軍張家口之舉，決不致久延，蓋塞北秋收在望，國軍勢欲在秋收前結束戰事，以獲得糧食，再者胡天八月即飛雪，裝備並不太適宜於寒季作戰之國軍，亦須於嚴冬來臨前，取得決定性勝利。</p>
<p>〔本報北平廿四日電〕某知各軍事家論冀省軍事地理稱：倘果如外間所傳國軍進駐張垣，則察西將較察重爲重要，由熱進入察北，再向張垣推進，似嫌迂遠，且草源相接，不宜行軍補給。氏繼稱：倘余爲守張垣指揮官，將以平綏路之懷來爲主要決戰地，蓋該縣城位於山上，懷來不下，張垣東面可無問題，但倘余爲進攻之指揮官，則當繞過懷來，經延慶而達下花園。氏對於近日報章所傳之豫北魯東緊張情形不重視，而謂「擒賊先擒王」，戰爭之眞正勝利，在於消滅對方主力，而其主力所在，必爲其心臟部分。</p>
<p>〔本報北平廿四日電〕某高級機關發言人稱：共軍近由察北多倫運到張垣傷兵三百餘人，但發言人不能證實多倫方面，已有戰鬥，並稱「在某種條件下，國軍可分三路開向張家口，而被迫應戰。」並暗示綏東國軍解大同圍後，已向東推進。發言人稱：張家口之某附屬醫院，爲共軍之唯一後方醫院，近機報由大同運回之二千餘，及由集寗遝回之千七百餘傷兵，則多因缺乏醫藥而死亡。</p>
<p>〔聯合社南京廿四日電〕聞進攻張家口之政府軍部隊，均配備新式武器，且將大量使用空軍。又聞朱德負有防禦張垣之責，已作初步佈置，準備迎繫國軍進攻，並令所部保持實力，以備最後決戰。</p>
<p>〔合衆社南京廿四目電〕國防部發言人對於北平電訊謂國軍已開始進攻張家口一節，加以否認。該發言人吿合衆社記者，謂政府目前無此計劃，國防部亦未曾頒發進攻命令。渠續稱，國防部迄未自北平司令部，接獲進攻之正式報吿。</p>
<p>〔中央社北平廿四日電〕共軍熱河總隊的六千餘，廿一日向寗城國重進犯，當被擊退，共軍向城西胡素台溝一帶回竄，建平以北共軍，向劉家店附近國軍襲擊，經國軍反擊後，共軍傷亡慘重，紛紛向黑水方面逃去。</p>
<h3>晋國軍進駐浮山　冀中迫雄縣近郊</h3>
<p>〔中央社太原廿四日電〕國軍於二十三日上午，進駐浮山縣城</p>
<p>〔本報北平廿四日電〕保定電話，向雄縣推進之國軍，昨晚已迫城郊，正激戰中。</p>
<p>〔本報天津廿四日電〕冀南已在醞釀大戰，石家莊地區共軍，最近大舉南調，企圖阻止北上之國軍，元氏賽邑間鐵橋，已遭共軍破壞，元氏之共軍獨立團，並已調至高邑一帶，準備破壞鐵路，超過漳河之國軍，已與共軍劉伯誠部展開激戰。</p>
<h3>恢復察省行政　組織地方武力</h3>
<p>察主席馮欽哉談話</p>
<p>〔本報北平廿四日電〕客居北平已久之察省主席馮欽哉，今吿記者，察省行政恢復後，對於附從共黨者將採寬大方針，不究旣往，恢復省政之第一要務，乃組織地方武力，縣長之成績，將視其能否完全控制該縣爲斷。共黨之邊區券在未奉中央具體指示前，暫禁流通，故能否有充足之法幣，供民使用，亦是間題。</p>
<p>〔本報北平廿四日電〕前冀察綏邊區司令張礪生，刻已奉調爲察省軍管區司令，張現在平助馮欽哉主席，整編察省地方武力。</p>
<h3>東北共軍擴編　調兵開哈爾濱</h3>
<p>〔中央社瀋陽廿四日電〕東北共軍積極備戰，最近由佳木斯五常與蘭等地，抽調兵力二萬餘，開抵哈爾濱，並由佳本斯運至哈市山砲，迫擊砲，及步機槍砲彈等甚夥，以補給雙城陶賴昭等處之典軍。又連山關草河口一帶之共軍第四縱隊所屬第十第十二旅，現已擴編爲師，各旅原屬團營，則擴編爲旅團，刻正加緊補充訓練中。</p>
<h3>馬占山週內赴京</h3>
<p>〔中央社北平二十四日電〕馬占山奉令調任東北保安副司令長官，週內赴京，向中樞請示後，返平轉瀋履新。</p>
<h3>蘇北共國又掘河堤　國軍向漣水推進　共黨邊區政府傳遷阜寗</h3>
<p>〔本報徐州廿四日電〕進至兩淮國軍，現一方面向漣水推進，一方面進行肅淸附近地區共軍殘部中。據悉共黨蘇皖邊區政府原設淮陰現已可能遷至阜寗，該邊區政府主席已李一氓半月前曾赴阜事失利，政治失敗圖改變作風，挽救在其「解放區旅政綱領」中謂將放棄階級鬥爭，而爭取民衆，爭取同情。按階級鬥爭，爲共產黨唯一政治手段，今日可見其矛盾一至於此。</p>
<p>〔中央社徐州廿四日電〕蘇北共軍，又在各處掘堤，以組止國軍之收復。據悉，沭陽境內，沭河下游之分水沙河東堤柴米河北堤，近被共軍掘毁多處，受災地區，計有廿餘村鎭，淹沒田禾一條萬餘頃，東海境內薔薇河，南起河莊，北至大夫廳，兩岸河堤亦被共軍掘毁，汜濫區域達二百四十餘里，沭海交界地區，規已一片汪洋，寬廣的數十里，東海及新浦鎭市街，已被水包圍，海新公路被水冲斷，以上被災情形，至爲嚴重。</p>
<h3>薛岳談戰局</h3>
<p>〔本報徐州廿四日電〕徐州綏靖公署主任薛岳將軍，廿三日晚接見本報記者，談最近戰局稱：蘇北魯南共軍政治經濟軍事主要根據地，爲淮陰，濟寗，菏澤，臨沂，現除臨沂外，均經國軍收復，共軍殘暴行爲，陷人民於水火之中，國軍被迫還繫以來，人民協力，所向順利，蘇北魯南局勢之澄淸，僅爲時間問題。談及共軍戰略戰術，薛氏喻之如耗子，此因共軍於抗戰中，未曾與日軍正式作戰，所運用之戰略戰術，一如昔日流竄時，攻繫國軍，長驅民兵衝鋒，招致大批傷亡，至爲可嘆。薛氏續稱：共黨不顯全國人民，要求安定願望，發動戰亂，已失民心，「解放區」人民熱烈歡迎國軍，自動相助，可證明古今中外，凡違背全民利益者，必將自食惡果。</p>

<h3>解圍後大同巡禮</h3>
<p>〔中央社太原廿四日電〕中央社記者此次隨慰勞專機前赴大同，實爲大同解圍後首次着陸之來客，自八月十六日軍調部大同小組於砲彈紛飛中，乘機凌空脫險飛平後，大同機塲即已不能使用，大同被圍四十五日，其間戰况之激烈，與共軍之殘暴，出人意表之處，非身歷其境者，殆難想像。北門外車站，一片佳土，彈痕累累，前此巍聳之水塔，今已僅餘龜裂之塔身，與凌亂之鋼筋，供人憑弔，車站機務段辦公處，僅有瓦礫一堆，與門外招牌相對，互悲身世。機車廠一片焦黑，磚壁四立，機車亦遍體鱗傷，心腹破穿，不堪目睹。估計進犯共軍，死於水塔下者，不下千餘，據確息。在共軍此役中，並曾迫使人民背負黃色炸藥，先行直趨水塔，而共軍即在後拉綫爆炸，一時血肉橫飛，死亡枕藉，尤爲人間慘事。東北挺進軍參謀長戴增駿語記者：「余從軍廿六載，身經百戰，從未有如此激烈戰鬥」。城東北御沙鐵橋，亦遭炸敗兩孔，該處公路木橋，爲大（同）陽（高）大道鎖鑰，又以耕田悉在河東，故亦爲大同市民生命綫，此橋爲日人於民國廿九年　築者，兩載始成，一切材料悉由吉林運來，此次共軍竟縱火焚毁其卅餘孔。沙嶺爲城東南唯一高地，足以瞰制機塲，共軍拚命爭奪，屢遭失敗，據云僅沙嶺東北碉堡一地，共軍即支付三千條命之代價，城西三里警察學校，石砌牆壁猶存，內部盡付一炬，障礙物附近　黍田內血跡斑斑，串成一條直錢，據負責據守該地保安十一團長焦克敬稱：共軍獨立二團，僅在此衝鋒兩次，即只剩二百餘人，記者巡視黍田內之血跡時，曾檢獲一共軍日記簿，經判斷爲排長日記，內載稱：「我昨晚作了兩個夢，一夢我父死了，一夢敵人（按指國軍）很兇，咱們（按指共軍）隊伍集合不起來，您們給我圓圓夢，至今我心裏還很害怕啊！我想我們爲什麽要打內戰呢？」其下級幹部極反對內亂，於此可見一斑。另據董團長稱：共軍迭次施放噴嚏性瓦斯，軍民中毒者甚多，我曾鹵獲毒彈數枚，（按共軍施放毒氣，除警校外，尙有北嶽廟與車站等數處）中共否認放毒宣傳，不攻自破。大同被圍期間，城內秩序井然，入晚，軍政幹部學生分段警戒，淸査戶口，晋劇院則按時演唱，慰勞傷兵，此誠緊張局面中之輕鬆插曲也。國軍指揮官楚溪春將軍語記者：此次戰爭，共軍以十倍兵力，猛攻月餘，而我卒獲勝利，其主因劂爲「人和」，並稱解圍後將由辦理緊急救濟入手，繼而解救，雁北人民，今日大同無家可歸之難民，　　亟待救濟，該地旱象早成，秋收至多僅有三成，今復受戰爭蹂躪，損失更爲慘重。記者於晋北上空往返途中，俯瞰同幷間昔爲大好山河。今已淪爲地獄之懷仁代啤等縣縮影，感慨不已。朔縣間鐵軌，悉被折毁，而迄爲國軍據守之應縣，古城，仍巍然矗立。城內雁北平原，一望無垠，但舊痕新創。累累皆是，此一片塞外風光，於記者及同機諸人心頭，勾起無限感喟。</p>
<p>〔中央社歸綏二十四日電〕此次集寗之役，較四平街之役尤爲激烈，僅城內外街頭躺臥之屍體，經檢明掩埋者，即達二萬具以上。今日民衆提及共軍舉行時，尤痛哭失聲，電燈公司已被共軍澈底破壞，鍋爐及重要機器，均被運走，城外火車站亦被破壞甚烈，民間當共軍敗潰時，被刧掠者尤夥。</p>

<h3>發展東北工鑛事業　次源會發表成立十五機構　技術人才擬設校就地訓練</h3>
<p>〔中央社北平廿四日電〕資源委員會主委錢昌照，此次視察錦西，葫蘆島，錦州，北票，阜新，瀋陽，撫順，遼陽，鞍山，營口，本溪，西安，長春，吉林等處廠礦，曾與有關方面詳細磋商，認爲東北重工業雖經摧毀，但若將現有基礎善加運用，仍大有可爲，過去日人在東北辦理重工業，爲備戰與配合作戰，其計劃頗多不合理之處，復因急於增產，疏忽若千基本工作，以致影響資源基大，東北今復返祖國懷抱，此種缺憾亟需調整改善，惟東北局勢迄未全定，許多事業雖應歸資源委會辦理，但實際上尙無法全面推行，目前最感缺乏者，爲高級及中級技術人才，資源委會擬與敎育當局硏討辦法，設立專科學校，就地訓練。現根據社會需要，配合整個國家經濟，就應歸資委會辦理之重大事業中，於本年十月一日起，先成立以下各單位：</p>
<p>各機構負責人名單</p>
<p>（一）東北電力局，局長郭克悌，副局長常　集，桂酒黃。（三）撫順礦務局，局長程宗陽，副局長謝子貞，郭忠。（三）阜新煤礦公司，總經理郭象豫，協理張伯平，婁良海。（四）北票煤礦公司，總經理雷寳華，協理吳稚田，鄒起盤。（五）西安煤礦公司，協理潘繼武代總經理。（六）鞍山銅鐵公司，總經理邵逸周，協理靳樹梁。（七）本溪煤礦公司，總經理張松齡。（八）東北金屬礦業公司，總經理施家福，協理潘鋕甲。（九）遼寗水泥公司，總經理理郁國成，協理齊慰（十）遼寗紙漿造紙公司，總經理趙煦雍，協理丁嗣賢，曹理卿。（十一）瀋陽化工廠，題長張克忠，副廠長蔡憲元。（十二）瀋陽橡膠廠，廠長阮覺施。（十三）葫蘆島硫酸廠，兼廠長姚文林。（十四）瀋陽機車車輛製造公司，總經理劉吉璣。（十五）瀋陽機器廠籌備處，主任孫文藻，副主任曾廣韜，魏華業。此外，尙有若干事業與資委會關內之同性質事業，可以合併經營或另成立四個附屬單位，即中國石油公司之東北鍊油廠（廠長未發表），華北水泥公司之錦西廠，兼廠長陸宗賢，中央機器公司之瀋陽製車廠，廠長李香洲，中央電工器材廠之瀋陽分廠，廠長湯明奇，上述各單位之工作計劃組織及預算，均已分別予以核定，限期執行，以期逐步使之機械化。現代化，又資委會東北辦事處現亦成立，處長謝樹英，吉長分處處長孫煒鄂。</p>
<h3>淸查團在廣州發現　一片接收糊塗帳　軍政部特派員莫與碩被看管</h3>
<p>〔本報廣州二十四電〕粵桂區接收淸査團，連日在此發現接收糊塗帳多宗，其中以軍政部特派員公署所接收者爲甚，該團最近在黃沙會庫査悉當時有鴉片一七七箱，由新一軍五〇師入駐時，該庫曾走漏四箱，該師開拔時將一七三箱移交軍政部特派員公署，其後即上下串通盜賣凈盡，及該署移交後勤部第三補給區，淸册中則已無此項目，而負責管理倉庫之敖景諒敖翔二人，已畏罪潛逃，現正密緝歸案，因當時有一撥發單，蓋有軍政部特派員莫與碩私章，故莫氏亦不無嫌疑。淸査團早已電宋院畏轉令國防部澈査嚴辦，現莫與碩已於廿三日抵此，行轅王處長衡，會同憲兵十六團團長，帶同憲兵五名，在機塲等候，莫氏由滬與憲兵第一分隊趙隊副及一副官同來，面容憔悴，下機後，即由周團長看管，同時在機塲迎候者有莫氏親信二人，均不准接近面談。現莫暫留此間憲兵部，等候淸査處理。</p>
<p>倉庫突起火　個中有文章</p>
<p>又在莫未來之前兩天，此間河南一倉庫，於二十一日夜十時許突然起火，直至翌日中午一時始完全熄滅，該倉庫係軍政部特派員公署接收移交第三補給區接管，庫內所轄物資，有如山積，糧食被服不可勝計，該庫已封存一載，向安無異，現忽在淸査期間突然起火，莫不詫異。據當事人稱，起火原因係因是夜守兵遺擲烟頭所致，淸査團現正進行調査。至該庫損失數字，現尙難估計。</p>
<p>又據海軍部廣州區特派員鄒毅稱：向日接收之敵偽船舶物資，爲數甚夥，惟按現存者與估計數字懸殊，其中或有歹徒隱藏虛報，或變賣自肥，刻除把握現實問題，提供淸査團參酌辦理外，並公開獎勵民衆舉報。</p>
<h3>廣州掘獲金屬磚　聞係漢奸產業　定期公開化騐</h3>

<h3>牛肉罐頭　變成石頭</h3>
<p>贛救濟品中一啞謎</p>
<p>〔本報南昌通訊〕行總江西善後救濟分署，散發罐頭牛奶牛肉等救濟物品時，領受此項物品機關，發見裝置罐頭之木箱中，上爲罐頭，下爲石頭，此項石頭，是否由聯總遠渡重洋、運載而來，抑分發機關舞弊，一般猜測紛紜。</p>
<h3>湘鄂贛淸查團團長　伊鰲悲憤不自已　謂接收人員之格根本有問題</h3>
<p>〔本報漢口廿四日電〕湘鄂贛淸査團團長仇鰲已離湘，今晚可到漢。據長沙來人轉述仇鰲離湘前發表談話稱：湘省淸查工作，所異於其他各地者，厥爲逃遁現象之層出不窮，或則贓物俱在而人已遠颶，或則人未離去而物已烏有。爲减少工作困難計，故在湘月餘，甚少發表淸査經過。現淸査已吿一段落，大部案件，已移送法院偵査，少數未了事宜，亦經委託省市參議會繼續淸結，將來返漢後，並擬另擬總報吿，今亦不必多贅，惟個人尙有感慨者，即此次辦理淸査工作後，深感一般接收人員，對國家觀念及道德觀念之欠缺，眞令人悲憤不得自己。例如敵人撤離岳陽時，當地電力設備尙完整無缺，而接收人員竟忍心將各種器材零星拆散出賣，以飽私囊，致令今日之岳陽，重又進入原始時代之情况，以此而論，若費之人格，根本有問題，即謂與獸無異，亦不爲過也云。又漢口地院連日偵査江漢關拍賣物資舞弊案，陳稅務司及點騐久三人監察員一人均有重大懷疑。</p>

<p>葛羅米柯代表這番話，我們並不感覺詫異，在他的談話裏，還是老調，也找不出新鮮的因素。前些時候，莫斯科電台廣播反美言論，蘇聯報紙發表抨擊美國干涉中國內戰的文字，我們固早已聽慣看慣，而裏應外合的中共，也早把他們所得之於「老師」的一套反美宣傳攻勢，在中國翻來覆去的表演過，我們也聽厭，看厭了。所以葛羅米柯代表的一番話，無足重視，不過恰在這時候，美國朋友們也有受了左傾份子的煽動，與中共在中國所鼓煽的若干政客，同時串演「美國退出中國週」，好像商量好爲葛羅米柯做啦啦隊，未免這把戲演得太顯露了一些。</p>
<p>葛羅米柯發表這種言論，其用意無非要在外交上對美國採取攻勢。因爲蘇聯代表在巴黎和會席上，節節失敗，未能發揮其對於和會的控制力量，於是借題發揮，利用希臘與阿爾巴尼亞的邊境衝突，對於英軍留駐希臘，大肆攻擊。但是到了安全理事會席上，並未能擴大其所發動的外交攻勢，因此又　換方向，企圖利用中國問題向美國發動攻勢。以重振蘇聯在國際的威望。同時又因美國國內，爲了華萊士主張對蘇綏靖而引起政界的軒然大波，結果華氏掛冠而去，使蘇聯更加懷疑美國政府有傾向「兩個世界」的趨勢，便一面製造「美軍退出中國週」，一面在外交上採取先發制人的手段，欲向美國輿論界投一炸彈，以引起美國國內議論的沸騰，使杜魯門總統不得不有所戒懼。但是在我們看來，不論外界的物議如何，美國政府的外交政策，光明磊落實在無隙可乘，而且也決無可以動搖之理。</p>
<p>杜總統於去年十二月間發表對華政策宣言，其要點有三；（一）美國承認國民政府爲中國唯一的合法的政府；（二）美國希望中國能成爲强大的統一的民主的國家；（三）美國不干涉中國的內政。至今美國迄未有所變更。至於美軍留駐中國，乃應國民政府之請，協助中國遣送敵僑敵俘返國以及樹立中國國內和平秩序一項任務，惜因共黨的阻撓而迄未完成。故要美軍退出中國，不必向美國要求，只須共黨不再梗阻中國的復員與統一，即可達到目的。蘇聯代表所稱美軍在中國業已造成足以引起國際磨擦一節。試問有什麽根據？</p>
<p>中國亦爲安全理事會常任理事之一，中國問題唯有自己能解決，即使要訴諸安全理事會，我國代表自己也自能提出，又何必要勞動蘇聯代表葛羅米柯越俎代庖？葛羅米柯自以爲仗義執言，但是我們不明白葛羅米柯的「義」，究作何解釋。我們退一步說，即使承認葛氏發言完全出於好意，但是葛氏越俎代庖之後，將中國置於何地！而跟隨葛氏，大喊中國間題要由聯合國安理會解決的若干中國政客，更是　　心理的十足表現。</p>
<p>中蘇兩國，同爲遠東的大國，自應　力合作，以維持遠東的永久和平。中國在抗戰期間，曾獲得蘇聯在精神土物質上的援助，即至今亦尙念念不忘。而自中蘇同盟條約簽字之日起，我國對蘇外交，更莫不以盟約爲準繩。但在蘇聯方面，雖去年十二月間三國外長會議時，亦同意不干涉中國內政。但蘇聯政府對於促進中蘇邦交的盟的究竟有沒有切實實行呢？今年七月間，蘇聯外長莫洛托夫竟反對中國爲巴黎和會的邀請國，現在葛氏又要越俎代庖，把我國看作阿爾巴尼亞還不如，我們風不知蘇聯究竟爲什麽要這樣侮辱她的盟友中國，一至於此！</p>
<p>中國所採取之外交政策，業經王世杰部長一再聲明，完全以國際合作共同維持世界和平爲最高指導原則，故在任何國際會議中，一貫的採取不偏不倚的超然態度。至於國共商談問題，更屬於我國內政。應與蘇聯毫無關係。蘇聯代表今忽越俎代庖，將中國內政訴諸安全理事會，我們實在覺得不勝遺憾。國民政府應即表示態度反對，提出抗議。而一羣忘記了國家民族的立塲，也來狂喊「美軍退出中國」的人們，也希望他們或有深深　悔的一天！</p>
<h3>滬市參議會休會</h3>
<p>上海市第一屆參議會開會兩週有二日，昨日下午已宣吿休會，並發表宣言。在十六天的會期中，參議會的消息滿載於本市各報；參議會所質詢的事件，所討論的議案，也非常引起全市市民的注意，甚至工商各界多有紛紛向參議會結隊請願者。即此可知，上海市民實在需要有一個代表民意的機關。而此次市參議會的成就，平心靜氣的看法，大體說來，可以認爲距離我們的期望還不十分遼遠。</p>
<p>當然，上海市經八年的抗戰淪陷，殘破之餘，又受到勝利一年以來物價暴騰的影響，工商市面早已外强中乾，祗剩表面空殼，民生凋敝，民力困頓，以言市政經費，實已不堪重負。然而惟其上海在戰後百廢待舉，如欲望其逐步復興，仍不失其爲國際第一流都市之地位，則市政建設，何可稍緩？此次市府本年下半年度之預算原爲八四七億餘元，不數　達三三三億餘元，今由市參議會在開源節流和重視建設而裁汰冗員的大原則下，將其核减爲七五五億元弱，不敷數亦已减至二二二億元弱，並於無可設法之中，准市府另微市政建設捐與公用事業附加稅以爲彌補。在參議會，一方面表示顧及民力，一方面又不忍見上海市政長陷於停滯之境，毅然負責，爲行政當局爲全市市民解決此一難題，不能不說是已具備民主國家地方議會的應有風度。蓋民主政治之要義，首在負責任，批評要負責任，決議尤其要負責任。人民代表若但知唱高調，濫批評，而於應負責任之處，規避不遑，則將始終不能解決一件事了，還談得到什麽建設？</p>
<p>其次、我們一看到市參議會對於幾個較爲重大的議案，都有相當合理的決議或建議，尤其感覺上海市民確已有了他們的代表在發言了。譬如：（一）在敎育方面，主張經費須佔支出總額百分之二十，而必須廢除敎育上的裝飾品，置其重點於國民敎育，以謀解決兒童的失學問題；要求嚴格考核私校的收費用途及下學期規定收費標準必須得到參議會的同意；（二）在工商金融方面，接受工商界的呼籲，將推派代表向中央作誠懇的請願，以挽救上海市面的崩潰；（三）在工務公用衛生警察各稱建設方面，竭力支持一切應行建設的計劃，而規定其所需的經費，但不許其徒然消費於「養人」；（四）在民生日用方面，督促政府從速努力遏止日來物價的漲風，建議中央根據社會習慣制定房屋租賃的法規，呼籲政府趕速裁撤不必要的燃料統制辦法，改爲獎勵人民競運煤炭來滬，以防冬季的煤荒；同時責成市府交涉收回跑馬廳土地，闢爲公園運動塲所，而關於賽馬是否賭博一層，呈請中央解釋等等，都可以見其犖犖大端，與眞正人民的意見相距不遠。</p>
<p>現在，市參議會第一次大會休會了，三個月以後，我們又將見其召開第二次大會。我們深盼市政府在這三個月之中，尊重此次市參議會的決議，逐一見諸實施；尤其切望市參議會的各種專門委員會，能於平日與市府有關各局切取聯繫，經常檢討其工作，則將來第二次大會開會時，民意機關對市府行政的批判與決議，必更能切實而有效了。</p>

<h3>史達林談話明示　目前無戰爭危險　謂與西方國家有合作可能　速撤在華美軍認爲維持和平所必要</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社倫敦廿四日電〕史達林元首本日接見「星期泰晤士報」駐莫斯科訪員發表談話，內容由英國電台加以廣播。該報記者詢史氏是否以爲美國軍隊迅速自中國撤退，乃爲維持和平所必要？史氏答稱：「誠然，此乃余之意見」。記者問史氏是否以爲英美正　以資本主義之鐵圈包圍蘇聯？史氏答稱：「目前並無戰爭之危險，各該國倘欲出此，（余對此不能斷定）當然不能成功」。記者間及德　問題時，史氏答稱：「余以爲蘇聯利用德國反對西歐與美國，此事不成爲問題。」史氏論及波茨坦協定與英蘇條約時稱：「蘇聯在德國之政策，僅有固的與持久的和平最安全之保障」。記者又問：原子炸彈是否威脅和平？史氏稱：「原子炸彈不足以決定戰爭，壟斷原子炸彈足以危及和平，但有若干事實與方法，足以使此種危險消失。所謂事實，即壟斷之不能持久，所謂方法，即原子彈之禁止使用是也」。</p>
<p>〔聯合社倫敦廿四日電〕史達林今日在莫斯科發表言論，表示相信蘇聯與西方民主國家之和平合作，「不但未見减退，抑且更將滋長」。又對指責莫斯科影響西歐各共產黨之政策等言，斥爲「荒謬絕倫，係從已破產之希特勒與戈培爾兵工廠借來」。並稱：渠對英蘇友好關係「確具信念」。</p>
<h3>對蘇聯領袖見解　英方正縝密硏究</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦廿四日廣播：倫敦某高級方面人士今日非正式發表意見稱，史達林所云「將無新戰爭」一節，顯係吿知西方國家，蘇聯亦將以强韌態度答覆美國之强韌態度。外交都發言人謂，蘇聯領袖之見解，各方正予以密切硏究，但政府之反映如何，目下尙不能預測，並云，史達林之答覆，「堅定而友好」。史氏所稱英美統治各界即欲對蘇聯實行次本主義包圍亦不可能之說法，顯係要求美軍儘速退出中國之一種警吿及意見，最重要之一點，厥爲史氏認爲原子彈僅足以侗嚇「神經衰弱者」，而不足以成爲未來戰爭中之決定因素。此外，史氏並暗示蘇聯不久亦將有原子彈矣。</p>
<h3>蘇聯向安理會提議　駐華美軍應撤退　謂此舉易引起國際磨擦　我代表反對安理會干涉</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕華盛頓廿四日廣播：紐約成功湖訊：蘇聯代表葛羅米柯在安全理事會中指査美軍駐華足以威脅世界和平一節，聯合國安理會中國代表謝君表示抗議。渠謂國反對安理會考慮蘇聯提議，因目前中國局勢無須安理會干涉也。</p>
<p>〔合衆社紐約州成功湖廿三日電〕蘇聯今日向聯合國安理會提出中國局勢問題，促其注意。蘇聯代表葛羅米柯指責美國陸戰隊之留駐中國，可能引起國際磨擦；葛氏稱，美車刻正干涉中國，冰島與拉丁美洲之內政，並謂，在日本與德國失敗後，外國軍隊之留駐於非敵性國家，不再能認爲出於戰爭之必要。渠引證中國著名人物一批所提之呼籲，其中敦促美國停止干涉中國內政，又稱，結果在中國所造成之局勢，不僅對中美兩國有關而已。葛羅米柯之聲明，爲蘇聯攻繫美國對華政策之第一次正式行動。莫斯科報紙前已攻擊美國此種政策若干次，政治觀察家早己確信由國突兀不安之局勢，最後勢必在安理會提出。蘇聯此一行動，發生於對希政治戰爭失敗之後。觀察家相信，對於中國問題，如蘇聯堅持不讓，葛羅米柯將處於更堅强之地位，因美國本國內之左翼興論，即有一大部份反對美國對中國國民政府之所謂片面援助以反對共產黨也。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社紐約廿三日電〕蘇聯向安理會提議，由聯合國各會員國報吿其在海外駐軍之情形，安理會即將加以討論。聞美國方面爲先發制人計，即將通吿安理會，謂美國軍隊正依照國際協定，自中國氷島及其他外國撤退中。按之蘇聯代表葛羅米柯所稱，美國海外駐軍，構成世界和平與安全之威脅。美國代表詹森將加以駁覆，並　列事實，證明美國軍隊正依照預定計劃撤退中云。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕舊金山廿四日廣播：前任美商務部長華萊士今日稱：「史達林與艾登最近之言論，已予企求和平之萬萬世人以新的和平希望。」</p>
<h3>德境英佔領區　組織聯邦建議</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕巴黎廿四日廣播柏林訊：關於劃分德境英佔領區各地爲聯邦一事，頃由德國問題硏究委會向英管制委會提出建議兩項：（一）係相當重要性之五區：包括威斯法里亞北部，哈將佛，萊茵，許萊史威格，霍爾斯坦，漢堡，不萊梅。（二）係勃倫斯威克代表所草擬者，劃分各處較小地區，組成兩個聯邦區。（甲）包括萊茵，威斯法里亞北部，（乙）德國低地區域。上述聯邦地區將與美國佔領區內史都伽特之州議會相彷。但是項辦法，英軍政府當局截至目前尙未予正式宣佈。</p>
<h3>四國外長昨集議　謀解決和會難題　史達林一席話澄淸政治空氣</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕巴黎廿四日廣播：四强外長準備於格林威治時間下午四時在皮杜爾辦公室舉行會議，謀在十月十五日前結束和會工作。史達林所稱並無新戰爭危險一節，使巴黎之政治空氣頗見澄淸。貝爾納斯因華萊士解職而威信增强，對於四强外長之商談，亦可能發生影響。和會當前最困難之問題，厥爲特港地位與保加利亞沿希臘國境地帶成立非武裝區域問題。四强外長亦可能規定討論對德和的之日期與地點。貝爾納斯主張在紐約舉行，但衆信莫洛托夫則主在歐洲舉行。澳洲代表霍奇遜要求和會於一年後再行召開，以便決定義大利殖民地問題。</p>
<h3>我代表主張　里比亞獨立</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕巴黎廿四日廣播：阿比西尼亞對義提出歸併伊里特利亞及紅海出口之要求，作爲賠償義國侵阿戰事之損失，今日實際上已獲得保證。當各國代表討論此一問題時，一致支援阿比西尼亞之要求。英美代表西方列强但各國均主張最後處置殖民地問題必須俟諸一年以後。中國代表郭泰祺提議將里比亞置於聯合國管制下若干年，或則立即准許其獨立，美印代表附議。</p>
<h3>解除希保邊防　軍事委會通過</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕巴黎廿四日廣播：和會軍事委員會以十一對七票，通過希臘對保加利亞和的修正案，解除保加利亞邊境防禦工事，三票棄權，反對者使巴西及斯拉夫代表。</p>
<h3>戰爭威脅迫在眉睫　美英蘇應互諒解</h3>
<p>—英前外相艾登發表演說—</p>
<p>〔聯合社倫敦廿四日電〕英國保守黨戰時外相艾登今日演說，力促英美「軍新接近」蘇聯，因目前關係含有迫於眉睫之戰爭「威脅」渠稱，共產主義與資本主義，並無不應和平共存之理由。艾登表示之感想，雖與美國前商務部長華萊士有相似處，但對美國訾議英帝國主義一節，則加非難。艾氏並響應前首相邱吉爾贊成組織歐洲合衆國之主張稱，渠欲促請華萊士注意不列顚共和國，乃「一自由國家之家庭」。　於巴黎和會及世界關係，艾登稱，「如果低估大局之嚴重性，實屬蠶愚，目前大局殊不安寗，不獨余已見此稱事態中，戰爭之威脅，迫於眉睫，即任何人讀得消息，均能推斷每過一週，即有仇視敵對之心隨之滋長一。</p>

<h3>認和約條件苛　義人仇英益甚</h3>
<p>〔路透社羅馬廿二日電〕義人以和的條件對義太苛，對於駐義英兵已開始不友好之行動。若干月前，皇家陸戰隊樂隊在威尼斯演奏時，曾遭大批靑年之咆哮，其後局勢乃每况愈下。義平民甚至軍警，亦公然對盟方人員作不歡迎之表示。義人認分割義艦隊之建議，實爲對義國聲譽之一大打擊，彼等認此事應由英國負大部份責任。義人復認在戰爭後期助盟方作戰之功，亦未被盟國予以適當之計及。</p>

<h3>本年夏季發生的蘇內部整肅運動</h3>
<p>— 合衆社派員沙奇利貝爾文著　—本報編譯室專譯—</p>
<p>〔合衆社紐約廿四日電〕今年夏季蘇聯內部發生了許多事情，但是外界所知道的祇是一些斷片。但是現在我們可以把這些斷片凑合起來，而明瞭它們的意了這許多事情，都說明蘇聯內部發生了重大的變化。</p>
<p>第一次講起這種事情的，是美國合衆社特派員亨達爾於六月廿六日自莫斯科發往紐約總社的二個電報，其中說：「莫斯科各報都講國家統制部正在剔除和審問全國有僞造生產數字，不法接受額外黨金，濫用工廠資金以及將國家財產供私人使用的工廠主任工程師和會計」。</p>
<p>自六月以來莫斯科方面發生的其他電訊，顯示史大林的戰後肅淸工作，並不限於蘇聯工業，甚至對於政府各部，紅軍，共產黨以及智識界也有影響。</p>
<p>最近有幾天，莫斯科報紙四頁地位中倒有三分之二是關於蘇聯公民的失職情形。但是這一些蕭淸的工作和以前不同，因爲所判的罪名，僅限於徒刑和罰金而已</p>
<p>七月十七日合衆社自莫斯科傳來未證實的報吿，說蘇聯著名英雄，蘇柯夫已被調任敖得沙警備司令一職。</p>
<p>數天之　，此訊獲得證實，但是蘇聯報紙對於此事，隻字不提</p>
<p>第二個失去職位的蘇聯要人是李維諾夫（蘇聯外次）八月二十三日，由蘇聯政府正式宣佈把　位年已七十的外交家去職，同日，蘇聯肉類與奶類工業主任史　諾夫也被去職，據烏克蘭共黨秘書克魯索夫稱：烏克蘭的人事，正在調動，目的是要加强黨員與政府的紀律。</p>
<h3>印回盟向蘇求援　請支持回印分治主張　尼赫魯闡明獨立外交政策</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦廿三日電〕印度信特省回敎同盟新聞秘書哈隆定星期四飛巴黎晤蘇外長莫洛托夫，擬請蘇聯在聯合國大會及巴黎和會中支持回印分治之主張。哈隆甫自印度抵此，渠主張由回盟派極堅強之代表團赴莫斯科，解釋並宣傳回敎徒之要求。渠並與英國共黨接洽，以獲取彼等之支持。</p>
<p>〔法國新開社新德里廿四日電〕印國大黨中委會本日開會，由臨時政府內閣總理尼赫書任主席，即席致詞，對該委會所面臨之工作，備加稱讀，特別强調印度已步入一新的歷史階段，同時並正式宣佈　去黨主席職務。尼赫魯並謂。共黨處處與國大黨作對，已信用掃地。國大黨對付共黨之種種步驟，不可誤認爲係針對蘇聯者，臨時政府之外交政策將爲獨立性質，不欲成爲任何外國之附庸。</p>
<h3>荷印華僑二百餘　已撤往聯軍防區</h3>
<p>〔聯合社巴達維亞廿三日電〕荷印軍事當局今日宣布：荷蘭軍隊應丹吉隆西而邦坡　華僑之請，已將該處華僑二百五十名撤往聯軍防區。按丹吉隆華僑數月前曾遭大屠殺。</p>
<h3>歸化美國者鑒諸　如不返美將失國籍</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓廿三日電〕美國會新近通過法案，規定凡已歸化美國之人民，苟住居其出生國滿三年，或住居他國滿五年以上者，若不作歸計，將於本年十月十四日失去其美國國籍。但亦有若干例外，如入籍後住居美國逾廿五年，及僑居國外時年　已屆六十五歲者，可不受此限制。此外則爲美國公司或機關之代表，其總部設在美國者，亦有因健康關係在外國休養或留學他國者，均可視作例外。捨此則殊無　規避，歸化人民如欲保全其美國國籍，惟有回國居住。</p>
<h3>日本通貨膨脹</h3>
<p>〔改造社東京廿四日電〕現在日幣發行總額，已約達七百億圓，而日政府已有提高物價水準之擬議，將於十一月起實行。</p>
<h3>颶風轉向東海</h3>
<p>〔聯合社東京廿四日電〕太平洋颶風吹過關島後，今日聞已北上，至台灣琉球間，向中國東海方面前進，有轉襲日本吳南部之可能。</p>
<h3>日人對國旗　不再感興趣</h3>
<p>皇靈祭節國旗寥寥</p>
<p>〔聯合社東京廿四日電〕今日爲日本秋季皇靈祭節，宮內舉行祭典，銀行及多數商店均休業。佔領軍常局雖准許日本公私房屋是日縣掛國旗，但僅有少數國旗飄揚。某日人言：「日太人現對國旗不再感覺興趣了」。</p>
<h3>近衛末次組閣期間　日政界內幕一斑</h3>
<p>小磯認與蘇締約並拓殖南方　可促成對華獲致協定之起點</p>
<p>〔改造社東京廿四日電〕遠東國際法庭今日續由檢察團提出德方公文，暴露軸心國勾結內幕。一九三九年德蘇簽訂互不侵犯條的後，日方陷於窘境，乃訓令駐德大使，停止締結三國同盟之交涉，待羿年（一九四〇年）德軍在西綫進行閃電戰成功，日本之積極分子大爲所感。重又主張加强軸心關係，不顧政界上層主張愼重之說，加速與德義締盟，終釀成巨禍。由此等證件觀之，軸心國間之關係始終爲德外部，德駐日大使沃特，斯塔瑪等人在幕後操縱，而日方則爲目前之變化所眩惑爲德國所利用。檢察官又提出日前內大臣木戶之日記，揭穿一九四〇年七月米內內閣被迫瓦解，變爲近衛內閣，決定採取三國同盟路綫前後之日政界內幕。</p>
<p>〔聯合社東京廿四日電〕國際法庭檢察團今日宣讀前德國駐日大使沃特致柏林之秘密報吿一件，證明德國曾於一九四〇年六月吿知日本，謂日本倘允於美國追攻德國時，襲擊菲律賓與夏威夷，則德國允許日本在荷屬東印與法屬越南自田行動。當時之日拓殖省大巨小磯贊同此議，襲擊美國問題之起因，由於日本問及沃特，德國是否準備在日本與中國中央政府間担任調處，俾在日本可接受之方式下結束中國戰爭。當時之日陸相武藤承認日本欲染指越南。小磯並謂日對蘇有成立互不侵犯條約可能，屆時蘇聯殆將要求中國西北及外蒙方面作若干領土的讓步，小磯以爲對蘇成立協定及實踐日在南方之殖民慾望，不僅逐步使日太在經濟上脫離美國而獨立，並將爲對華成立協定之起點。沃時結語稱：「截至目前爲止，余以爲中·日·蘇組成太平洋集團，與德國結合，使美國在太平洋區域束手受縛，足以剝奪其自由行動，乃顯而易見之事」。沃特之辯護人要求傳沃特對質，審判長魏勃答以考慮後再決定。</p>

<h3>原子炸彈投擲法　怎樣擊中數千哩外敵人　是美軍今日最關心問題</h3>
<p>— 合衆社特派員密勒著　本報編譯室特譯</p>
<p>美國軍事最高指揮部今日最關心的問題，就是怎樣把原子彈投向數千哩外的敵國目標。過去一星期中，美國官方發表兩件公吿，都使人這樣想法。其一是白宮方面所透露的：聯合總參謀部已決定將原定明年四月在比基尼島舉行的第三次原子彈試騐無定期延期，其二就是海軍部所宣佈的：尙未建造完成的四萬五千噸戰艦「肯塔基」號和二萬七千噸戰鬥巡洋艦「夏威夷」號，將改造爲</p>
<p>火箭彈軍艦</p>
<p>最高指揮部正擬利用剩餘的人力和財力，集中硏究怎樣去用長距離火箭彈放射原子彈，而不願分散力量到原子彈試騐方面去，因爲原子彈的破壞力已經證明了。陸海軍都決心在參加新戰爭時不再使用上次戰爭中所使用的武器，刻正努力從事火箭彈的硏究，深信由無錢常控制，並裝有原子彈頭而能飛越海洋和大陸的火箭彈極有用處，而必然會被廣泛使用，所以美國的陸海軍都要把這種</p>
<p>老武器改進，但海軍深怕在該方面落在陸軍之後。當比基尼島的原子彈試騐正在進行的時候，陸軍已經在新墨西哥州的沙漠中放射V——二型火箭彈。早在今年七月原子彈試尙未舉行的時候，白朗第海中將對海軍方面硏究火箭彈計劃的進程遲綏，就深表憂慮。白氏一方面是原子彈試騐的司令，同時又是海軍特種武器作戰部主任。在第二次</p>
<p>原子彈試驗前五日，他就在講要儘速回到華盛頓去了。關於海軍對火箭彈的硏究，他說：「火箭彈的試駝還沒有受到我的指揮」。然白朗第和參加原子彈試騐的其他領袖、都希望深水原子彈試騐能照預定計劃實行，這是原子彈對海軍船艦威力的最後也是最高度的試騐。關於原子彈進一步試騐的延期舉行，負責官方並沒有公然提出火箭彈試騐的迫切爲延期舉行的一種理由，但是其他的理由似乎都不能自圓其說。復員雖是一種次要的因素，但無疑地是一種因素。至於費用的因素、似乎更加不足以置信。白宮秘書羅斯估計：深水</p>
<p>試驗的取消可以節省國帑三千五百萬元，但如軍界認爲此項試騐的完成對美國的安全絕對需要，那麼它決不認爲那筆費用是太浩大的。軍界似已願意耗費金錢及人力於其他方面，即原子彈的遞送方法，這似乎是確定無疑的。原子彈試騐者能從一種試騐裏面搜集資料，由此推斷在不同的情形下應該發生何種現象。他們可用一小塊TNT炸藥在水池中試騐然後約略推演出第一次及第二次原子彈試騐的情形但往往</p>
<p>結果出預料之外，第三次深水試騐情形亦正復相同。白朗第說：「這正是我們所以從事這些試驗的原因。」第一，二，三，四和第五顆炸彈已經證明：在十億分子一秒鐘放出的原子能是有絕大的破壞威力的，因此深水試騐果然是需要而且必要的，但軍界方面顯然覺得其他新硏究更加重要。目前急切的問題，不是原子彈的威力如何，而是怎樣把原子彈投擲到敵人那裏去，以最少的時間，達到最大的距離。</p>

<p>市參議會經十六天之連續會議，已於昨日下午六時半結束完成全部議程，並舉行隆重簡單之閉幕儀式。</p>
<p>奏樂行禮如儀後，先由議長致詞：略謂此次大會因議案繁多，故延期兩日。在大會進行期內，我們很謹愼，很努力，凡應討論的項目應負的責任，大體都已解決，相信每一位同人已爲中國民主政治尤其上海民主政治奠下堅强健全之基礎。此次最感欣辛與欽佩的，是市長非常了解民主政治的眞諦，對於本會極爲尊重，每次會議均來列席參加，並對於本會未盡明瞭的地方儘量解釋。本來民主政治的進行必須立法機稱與行政　機構互相配合，互相協助，才能圓滿完成。立法與行政　構同樣都爲人民服務，所異者途徑不同職責不同而已。本人覺得此次大會中我們的精神已達到此理想，尤其感謝各位同人熱心出席，大會從未發生延會流會的情形，始終在緊張熱烈的空氣中進行，這是太屆市參議會値得自慰的地方，以後並望繼續共勉。此次通過之預算使市民負担增加，固然感到非常抱歉，非常慚愧，但是希望市民顧全大局，共加原諒。請恕我一再提到大美晚報，他們批評本會通過的預算認爲很合理，我們一方面固然應顧到人民的痛苦與負担，一方面亦應顧到市政的建設復興與發揚光大，因此預算案費去很多時間討論，現在希望市政府立即根據大會的決議重新編製後送交本會備爲考核監督之準繼。尤其希望下年度的預算能在本會十二月間第二次大會以前送到，俾可加以更縝密更精細的審核。至於本年度的決算則希望在明年三月間本會第三次大會時審核。預算決算的審核實在是本會最主要最重大的任務，因此特別提請當局注意，希望立法機構與行政機構共同協助來完成上海市民主政治的初步建設！</p>
<p>市長致詞　決依大會指示　不折不扣執行</p>
<p>市長繼起致詞，認爲民主政治在上海確已建立基礎。他說：「第一屆的市參議會凑巧在我任內舉行，感到非常榮幸。大會中議長與各位參議員所表現的成績可以絞諸任何國家的議會而無愧。議會最怕不負責任、祗知批評而不知建議指示。但是這一閃的參議會非常負責任、令人欽佩之至。現在各位己經充份表現了民主政治的精神，比後將輪到行政方面來繼續。我可以保證一定接受大會的指示，不折不扣的照各位意思去執行。其次希望大會閉幕以後，常設的各組委員會繼續與執行機關保持聯繫，因爲立法比較容易，但執行時則常常不如理想，甚至有發生流弊的情形，因此希望各位冬做耳自，多多報吿，我一定衷心接受。」</p>
<p>議員答詞　議而決決而行　希望繼續努力</p>
<p>市長致詞完畢後，即由議會公推陶參議員百川致答辭稱：本會舉行了十六天會議，個人覺到非常感奮。中國會議制度實行不久。。據過去的會義來看，多半是失敗的，留下了四句口頭禪即「會而不議，議而不決。決而不行，行而不動。」經過八年抗戰後，會議已較前進步得多。經我們這次大會的成績來看，即可證明。我們是「會而議」，即舉行會議以來，從未流會，「會而議」「議而決」，已經可說做到了。</p>
<p>至於是否決而能行，這是市政府的責任，我們已做到了前一半的責任，後一段要請市府去做。希望市府也能在經過八年抗戰後在行政上求進步。我們的吳市長是一位賢明的市長，以他過去的才幹經騐而言，知道他對於民主主義具有信仰，一定能尊重民意，也相信他定能在「議而決」後「決而行」。</p>
<p>但僅僅「行」，尙不够，必須要「行而動」，然這「動」並非是市長一人或少數主管機關的力量所能做到的。而是要參議會同人，繼續不斷督促帮助才能達到。各種委員會就是代表將來繼續督促帮助市府的機構。人類往往有惰性，我們如果不被督促也可能不努力，因此希望我們的選民能督促帮助我們，使我們有力量督促市政府。因爲有了熱心的市民，才有忠誠的議會，有忠誠的議會，才有健全的市政府，所以我們殷切期望市民隨時督促我們繼續努力。</p>
<p>這次開會，我們對潘議長及徐副議長，特別是潘議長應該　勞，（全體參議員一致熱烈鼓掌）。這次議會人多事亦多，若無潘議長的智慧和經騐來領導指示，決無此大成績，我們應該熱烈慰勞。（再鼓掌）局時新聞記者這次在報章上亦表現了民主政治的輿論，參議會若無新聞記者的督促，也許會中途而廢。上海的報紙確已做到了人民的喉舌，也做到了中國新聞界的前鋒。我們應特別爲本會感謝新聞界</p>
<h3>建設浦江大橋　倡議市民一日運動力　讀者致函本報轉送會議通過</h3>
<p>工字第三十一號提案，是本報轉致參議會的一對讀者來函。這封信是張德采君寫的，倡議上海市民一日運動，以建設黃浦江大橋。經審査委會提交大會作爲建議案，並送請都市計劃委員會參考，已獲大會無異議通過。張君建議辦法，有唱義務戲，舉行球類義賽，各界人士捐薪一日，房東捐房租一天，人力車夫三輪車夫移捐全部車資等。</p>
<h3>抗戰損失　交涉賠償</h3>
<p>參議會昨日上午，無異議通過社字十號·十一號·十二號提案。三案案由爲：積極辦理勞工福利案，請積極推進各區合作社，並輔導專營信用業務合作組織，以活潑金融案。及抗戰損失，應交涉賠償，被害難胞，應充分救濟，以抒民困，面慰民望案。關於損失估價，應以現時物價爲標準，所有行政院賠償委員會，原訂依照物資損失時爲佔價標準之辦法，應請市府，　是中央予以改正。</p>
<h3>松滬路改道問題　決議仍照原路綫</h3>
<p>關於淞滬鐵路要不要搬塲的問題。首由工務局趙局長說明淞滬鐵路改道的辦法：將淞滬鐵路路軌拆遷至中山西路以西郊外，就是京滬及滬杭甬路路軌銜接處起點作一直綫，使閘北在淞滬路綫以內敷設，並建原有路基改建柏油馬路，添設無軌電車及公共汽車。對於閘北虹口的繁榮有極大幫助。</p>
<p>參議員方面認爲，淞滬鐵路是中國近代史上第一條完成的鐵路，而且目前未修復的不過數里，所以主張仍照原路綫不必搬塲。</p>
<p>表決結果，以七十六票通過，仍照原來路綫，迅速整理修復淞滬綫。</p>
<h3>營造廠技十問題</h3>
<p>內政部規定，營造廠登記需有技士一人。工字第三號提案，爲建　取消此種規定。理由是技師人才缺乏，同時本市最龐大的建築物，係海關，華懋飯店，國際飯店。沙　大厦等，都是營造廠商憑經騐承造，根本沒有聘請技師。但這個辦法旣是內政部規定的，工務局根本無權取銷。所以，大會的決議是：本案由太會向中央主管部建議。</p>
<h3>哈同花園改闢公園　大會一致通過</h3>
<p>關於租借哈同花園爲本市公園，以增加市民遊息之所的問題，昨日上午參議會討論工字號提案時，汪竹一稱：哈同遺產管理委員會曾有信給參議會，聲明哈同花園是英僑的產業，同時他們正預備迭房子，以解救上海的房荒。但據工務局趙局長的說明：哈同夫人是中國人，遺產應照中國法律管理。同時根據都市計劃委員會的設計，那一帶不宜再建房子，應設公園。王參議員正廷說：公園太少，和人民健康有很大關係。哈同花園倘蓋了許多房子，將不再像一個公園。所以，工務局絕對不可允　　們再造房子。應該繼續向他們商租，大多數參議員都鼓掌擁護，表決通過。</p>
<p>市參議會昨日上午討論工字提案，共計三十二案，茲將無異議通過各案之案由列下：北火車站上下旅客衆多，交通擁塞，擬具補救辦法案。請市府加强行車管理，增闢鬧市道路，以及增加公共汽車車輛，俾暢市區交通案。塡平已經淤塞之肇嘉浜，另於東端建造菜市塲，中間舖築馬路，西站裝設船埠，以重衛生而利交通案。爲抗戰期內，各商輪公司所有船舶損失重大，提出賠償案。添裝各區電燈，以利行人而維治安案。請市府將繁榮南市閘北辦法，作爲繁榮大上海之初步計劃案。全盤疏濬黃浦案。拆除交通路　障碍物案。疏濬郊區河浜或建築溝渠案。在郊區地方裝置自來水管，以重衛生案。展期逐步廢除人力車案。開闢市輪渡碼頭，以利發展市榮案。迅即修復本市原有各馬路，以利交通而便民行案。改良水陸交通管理，以策安全案。恢復郊區菜塲，以整市容案。本市公園應一律加强管理案。確定大上海計劃案。學生與公敎人員經濟皆感困難，應請免費乘車案。組織碼頭倉庫公司，增進航運效能案等。</p>
<h3>限制用電　霓虹燈將禁止</h3>
<p>工字第四號提案：取締市民，疆用電力，並擴充電源，以裕工業案。引起相當熱烈的辯論。馬少荃稱：電熱用電應該求其平等，有人享受得到，有人享受不到，太不公平，所以現在的常熱用電，應該全部拆除。對於目前電荒情形，公用局趙局長有所說明：「現在所以發生電荒，是因爲機器修理遲延的緣故。要請市民帮助解決。對於霓虹燈，最近也預備下令禁止，至明年二月底爲止。」潘議長說；「我們晚上看見，許多店家已經關門了，而電燈牌樓却通亮，實在應該禁止。只有公道合理辦法，始可服人。那些沒有煤灶爐灶的人，用一點電熱，都要拆除，叫人家怎樣吃飯！」現在上海每月發電六千三百萬度，除去電力公司本身所消耗的，實計有五千七百萬度，其中三分之二是工廠用的，三分之一是普通用戶所消耗的。最後關於節的用電所通過的決議爲：「節約用電由公用局根據公平合理之原則，酌定限制用電辦法。並鼓勵各工廠自行購置發電機，並協助各電力公司修復損壞發電機增加電力，至節的之電，儘量供給各工廠，以增加生產。</p>
<h3>財政地政敎育提案　繼續討論通過</h3>
<p>下午繼續討論各組提案，因時間關係，由秘書長將各案案由辦法及審査意見等宣讀一遍後，除少數略加提出修正外，餘均順利通過。</p>
<p>財政地政方面自財地字十七號起至二十五號止其中重要者爲：（一）請政府减少田賦征額配額並請折征法幣以蘇民困，辦法由市政府對於根據棉價折征法幣迅擬具體方案轉請中央採納施行。（二）整飭本市各稅收機關稽征人員之風紀以芷綱紀，辦法由參議會通知市政府分別函令各稅收機關切實辦理。（三）職工工資徵收所得稅擬請政府酌量减低並自九月份起實行，辦法送請市府轉請中央核辦。其餘通過者有：（一）建議市府將所屬對物資支付集中統一辦理以節人力物力並减少流弊。（二）提請政府對舶來捲烟進口稅率應與國產捲烟同樣依市塲價格課稅以歸平等而維民族捲烟工業。</p>
<p>（三）撥日本賠款及敵僞物資之一部辦理本市建設事項。（四）請市府對本市公私空地作普遍調査與登記而期合理之使用以整市容而建地盡其利。（五）營業稅之徵收由各業同業公會協助財政局徵收以裕市庫收入。（六）請市府轉呈中央提早制定法令使耕者有其田，俾實現國父平均地權之遺敎而爲各省市之倡導。</p>
<h3>私校收費問題再度引起辯論</h3>
<p>又上次討論時保留之財地字第六號請政府規定房屋定期租的之原承租人有優先承租權一案，因最近立法院已派員來滬調査房屋糾紛情形，擬訂租賃條例，故決議送請市府轉呈立法院採納修訂敎育提案中對於私校收費問題曾引起相當辯論。黃炳權不國賢等認爲私校收費太高，校長賺錢，故主張應按照敎育局規定的最低額收費，並應分期繳納。詹文滸則認爲大多數私立學校均在艱困之條件下補救市立學校之不足，解決學生之求學問題，故對於學費一項不必苛議，最後決定除原有辦法（一）私立學校取費標準應由敎育局就當時物價情形及各校實際需要依其成績訂定並嚴予監督，切實遵照。（二）私立學校應規定免費及半免費學額免費不得少於百分之二十，半費不得少於百分之十。（三）市政府應令各校校董會切實負責規劃各校經費並審核其收支帳目外，另添加一條：下學期學費標準敎育局於訂定時應徵得參議會之同意</p>
<p>國民學校應積極增設，並以市郊平衡發展爲原則，由敎育局訂定具體建校方案，實行分期建設，以求本市國民敎育之普及與改進。</p>
<p>市立學校</p>
<p>市立小學此後不應再以任何名義收取變相學費，市立中學不得任意收取尊師金以輕市民負祖，市校敎師底薪則由敎育局根據公平原則酌予調整提高。</p>
<p>學校數量不够，學生失學者衆多，爲謀補救起見，建議敎育局將市立私立各大中小學校改爲兩部制上課以資增加學額而免學生向隅。</p>
<p>通過各項　敎育提案</p>
<p>此外通過的提案有（一）請政府鼓勵設立私校並予以補助俾使普及敎育。（二）請舉辦各項有關敎育從業人員之福利事項並酌量提高敎員待遇，以改進敎育事業。（三）請市政府普逼發展中學職業學校曁籌設女子師範學校。（四）抗戰時期被毀之私立學校請政府迅予救濟以示激勵而宏敎育。（五）本市校舍缺乏，請市政分別執行補救辦法。（六）請市政府普設民衆學狡及補習學校，分別收容失學民衆。（七）組織敎育考察團派赴國外考察敎育。（八）各私立小學校應由所在地區公所協助督導以利改進。（九）利用電台增闢敎育節目以灌輸民衆智識。（十）女子學校應增訂產科常識及婦科嬰科常識課程。（十一）請政府特別重視科學敎育並促進科學標準化。（十二）請政府提倡家庭敎育注重母敎並設立專管人員以專責成。（十三）請政府舉辦文化事業貸金。（十四）獎勵增設公私立圖書館。（十五）普遍提倡體育以救積弱藉振國魂。（十六）請政府獎助敎育文化事業提高學術文化水準轉移社會風氣。（十七）請政府撥定專款限期重修文廟以示尊孔而保公產。（十八）請市府酌辦在市中心區建設美術館陳列古今美術文物俾人人得資觀摹。（十九）請市府採擇施行飭令敎育局統一民衆敎育機構確定中心目標以節公帑</p>
<h3>各種公用事業　可以民營官督</h3>
<p>關於統一電車及公共汽車路綫，增加車輛，改善交通，擬請公用局責成各該公司切實執行，以重秩序案。這是工字第五號提案的案由。但審査意見中第一項：各種公用事業，以國營爲原則，但在政府財政困難時，得官商合辦，或民營官督之。不過，徐永祚認爲在目前政府財政困難之秋，用不着唱高調，國家旣然拿不出錢來，就乾脆歸民營。况且國營的成績如何，大家也都看見了。所以他主張：各種公用事業，現在以民營官督爲原則。在竹一的聲明是：以國營爲原則，是根據中央法令，而且審查意見中有一個但書，實際上和徐參議員的意見完全一樣。最後王參議員正廷起立建議：「各種公用事業，除中央法令另有規定外，以民營官督爲原則。」表決時，王參議員的提議以七十九票多數通過。</p>
<h3>賽馬仍是一懸案　最後決議賭博部份請示中央解釋　一面請市府進行交涉收回跑馬廳</h3>
<p>〔本報訊」市參議會中最引人注意和議員們發表意見最多，然而遲遲未決的「賽馬問題」，終於昨天休會前提到大會作了一小時時的空前緊張熱烈的討論。參加會議的人，對這幕精彩鏡頭，早已等待良久了。昨天下午，大家正因爲看情形參議會不像結束的樣子，討論「跑馬」案又將延期而感到失望時，突然議長宣佈大會決定休會，多數議員們高呼「贊成」於是壓軸戲的賽馬問題上塲了。臨時在旁聽席上吸引了不少的來賓。討論的結果，雖然仍不免使關心這件事的人失望，但總算有了個初步議決。</p>
<p>議長早已預料議員對這案子高見必多，可是時間有限，所以特別提出僅限於（一）可否賽馬，（二）中心區可否賽馬，（三）如何收回跑馬廳三點討論。</p>
<p>詹文滸首先代表一位李姓的市民申訴他老家從前住在跑馬廳有四十三畝地，而被英國人强購後未曾領款的情形。可是議長報吿在此案未討論前市長先要有一番說明。</p>
<p>市長說明兩點</p>
<p>市長開頭就說：「跑馬問題儘管請公開討論，市政府決尊重參議會的決議請諸位放心。」關於這議案的來由，市長說是跑馬總會來請求開放賽馬，當時他就想到跑馬廳應該由市政府收回經營，這是根據在二個原則上的；（一）市中心區跑馬廳不應多蓋房屋，而應多留空地，興建公園，改善交通。（二）上海爲全國第一大都市，但舉行盛大集會時還須借用戲院，實有失體統，市參議會擬用前日僑自治會作會址，也是勉强得很，所以在上海都市計劃中，認爲興建大會塲參議會等沒有比這更好的地方了。</p>
<p>「賽馬不賽馬是另一問題」，市長繼續說，「我祗是想征收跑馬廳的地皮。不管跑馬是賭博，還見體育，應該在郊外舉行，跑馬總會也承認這話對的，他們已同意隨時可以由市政府征收，而且還有書面文件答應。」</p>
<p>跑馬廳地皮一定要收回</p>
<p>跑馬廳的地皮一定要收回，這是決定要做的。可是「那裏來那麽多錢？」爲這事也多方考慮到了。發行公債吧！這塊地是利用來做公共會塲，公園等之用，沒有人肯抵押的。所以在這種經濟困難情形下祗能想到「羊毛出在羊身上」的辦法。在償還地價時，跑馬廳五百畝地如果按照周圍有建築的地價來算是辦不到的。但當時跑馬總會與上海道合所訂方單中　定跑馬廳地永遠不得建屋。所以我們在交涉時不妨提出跑馬廳塲地不能按四週有建築之地價來算。這樣賽馬二年所得稅收約一百億元，也許可以成交。如果在郊外舉行賽馬，我們可以補償他們五百畝地再加上現在跑馬廳建築物的代價，這是比較合理的。</p>
<p>根據從前官廳訂約，同時中美中英條約中規定「非以欺詐手段取得之產權不得廢除」。我並非奉承外人，但上海市民大國民態度不能不尊重人家權利。如果不准他們賽馬，則他們有權處分自己的產物。我不敢也不願提倡賽馬，但由建設上說，這塊地皮不收回是上海一個極大的損失。所以希望參議會能授權與市政府先與跑馬總會交涉。</p>
<p>各參議員爭先發言</p>
<p>接着，議員們都爭先起立發言，後由議長規定依次提出意見。張中原想出了兩個辦法：（一）收回跑馬應費用可由市府發行公債，（二）用參議會的立塲向敵產處理局取一部份物資。出售款項以作收回之用。至於跑馬在外國有，在中國不一定要有。美國有「原子彈」，出國爲什麽沒有？</p>
<p>壟夏認爲在二年內收稅所得以收回跑馬廳是不可能的，除非跑馬總會能向市政府保證二年後一定按此數出售與市府。</p>
<p>呂恩潭「絕對」不贊成跑馬說：「跑馬絕對是賭博」。他提出四點：（一）跑馬賣彩票「絕對」是賭博。他要問本市禁賭令有否解除？否則根本不能討論跑馬間題。（二）假定市中心區不應跑馬，郊區亦同樣不能有。賭博是不道德的事，不道德的事不應放在市區內，爲什麽搬到郊區去？（三）臨參會曾通過將跑馬廳改成羅斯福公園，爲何至今音訊杳無？（四）有人認爲要測騐本屆市參議會有無正義感，祗須看對跑馬問題的決議，所以要求鄭重決定，反對跑馬者都應該起立。</p>
<p>王正廷主張　在郊外舉行</p>
<p>王正廷覺得此話「不大妥當」，他堅決地表示：「我本人不賭博的，但跑馬並非賭博，無傷大雅。市長提出此案，主要的在如何收回跑馬應。但對於第二點不表同情，准許他們跑二年馬也是「不妥當」的。市中心區不應常跑馬，交通受阻碍，跑馬一次各洋商機關三天不辦公像什麽話？我主張到郊外去跑。同時參議會當和市府聯合設法收回跑馬廳。」</p>
<p>費樹聲表情和聲勢的緊張，引起了全場注意。他說：「這是我最後一次發言，絕對反對跑馬。我要請大家對賭博下一定義，買跑馬票輸輸贏贏爲什麼不是賭博。如果要提倡體育，試問上海有多少游泳池，有多少體育館。跑馬在美國無傷大雅，但在中國建設之時有復大雅。中國是落後國家，不向好的地方追求而學壞的，本人絕對反對。去跑馬的人不一定都有錢，也有窮的想去投機。不論有錢人或窮人，我們都要愛護，要敎訓他們。本人理由還很多，但時間不及了。市長說非跑馬不能收回跑馬廳。這是「要挾」，我們不能被「要挾」，不平等條約就是這樣要挾出來的。這是上海三百九十萬市民不贊成的。」</p>
<p>王立本，孫震春也認爲跑馬有賭博行爲。</p>
<p>龐京周想把緊張空氣緩和一下。他要大家注意原提案祇說「賽馬」而未提「賣馬票」。至於市長說要交涉，未說已經交涉了，也未說有把握，所以何妨等有把握時再提出下次大會討論。</p>
<p>法律觀點</p>
<p>馬君碩引用法律以打開僵局，他指出三十二年九月三日國民政府公布（同年十月一日施行）違警罰法第三章第六十四條第七項：「於道路公共塲所或公衆得出入之塲所，爲類似賭博之行爲者」應處七日以下拘留或五十元以下罰鍰或罰役。所以跑馬若非「賭博」也至少是「類似賭博之行爲」，反對舉行。</p>
<p>諸文綺理會到了一個根本問題，他問：「跑馬不帶賣彩票，稅收由何而來？帶賣了彩票是不是算賭博？」他贊成在郊外跑馬。張志韓突出冷門，他一贊成」跑馬。他認爲跑馬不是賭博。因爲要收回地皮很困難，必須想出一條路來。如果能不在市區內跑更好，否則亦贊成在跑馬　跑。每月收稅三億至五億元不一定要積起來，亦可以用作市府經費　輕市民負担。上海禁止，靑島漢口爲何不禁止？如果投買彩票是賭博，那末以前的航空建設獎券，交易所交易等是否算賭博。</p>
<p>跑馬賣彩票是否算賭博</p>
<p>姜屛瀋正式動議賽馬帶賣彩票是否算賭博請問中央，如係賭博則對中央法令有抵觸，根本不必討論。</p>
<p>最第討論時間已到，陳公　應和瞿鉞搶着發言，結果陳公達問「如果贊成跑馬的話，那末要是你們自己的子女去跑是不是贊成？」申報前次測騐，五十九票贊成跑馬，尙有一千二百二十五票反對。我們應該以大衆的意思爲意思。</p>
<p>瞿鉞結束了整個討論。他對跑馬大爲不滿，皺緊了眉說：「我住在跑馬廳旁邊有五十年，積五十年經騐，看見跑馬就討厭。外國人跑馬還要放假，我看大家「不必費心」討論，我保險此案通不過。</p>
<h3>改善浦江交通　籌組市輪渡公司決定官商合辦</h3>
<p>關於改善浦江交通和籌組官商合辦的上海市輪渡公司，是工字第二號及十九號提案的內容。幾位浦東的參議員瞿鉞·陸惠民·鍾玉良等紛紛發言。</p>
<p>澈底解決浦江交通，自以浦江上架設橋樑或在江底鑽鑿隧道爲上策，所以決定送請工務局計劃辦理，提出二次大會報吿。不過趙局長認爲時間上恐怕來不及。潘議長說：不妨先報吿一部份，至於增加市輪渡船隻，並協助合法的民營濟渡，改良碼頭等辦法，送請公用局積極進行。</p>
<p>關於市輪渡公司的問題，癥結有一：一爲民營輪渡的航權，二爲市輪渡公司的年期。但最後都得到合理的解決。凡高橋·東溝等地，在抗戰前已航行之民營輪渡，市輪渡公司應尊重其旣得的航權。市輪渡公司的年限，定爲三十年，不過自第十六年起，倘市府財庫充裕，可由市府收　。因爲趙局長說明，倘定期三十年，商人因年限過多，賺不回本錢來，不肯投資，那麼就要辦不成功了。結果由朱文德提出上面的折衷辦法，得到多數的通過。</p>
<h3>最後決定兩項原則</h3>
<p>結果，還是以表決方法來解決這問題，但祗是在原則上決議了二案：（一）一百二十人中以八十票通過「賽馬附帶賣馬票是否係賭博請中央解釋」。（二）一百十三票通過「跑馬廳收回，請市府趕緊進行交涉後將經過情形報吿下次本會大會」。</p>
<p>上海到底還有沒有「跑馬」？我們祗能等待中央的答覆了。</p>
<p>建議撤銷　烯料統制</p>
<p>繼恢復賽馬問題激辯之後，尙有臨時動議多起：（一）王參議員正廷提：爲解除上海市民煤荒之恐慌，本會謹代表上海四百餘萬之市民，向中央主管機關建議，撤銷燃料管理委員會之燃料統制，俾市民自由購買運銷燃料以蘇民困案，決議通過。（二）陳參議員培德提：查日來物價上漲不已，擬請市政當局，會同各同業公會，　商有效制止辦法案，決議通過。（三）沈參議員鼎等提：擬請市政府令飭市敎育局，迅即調整附屬機構，節的開支，普及國敎案，決議通過。（四）沈參議員鼎等提：國民敎育班收取各項費用，應嚴加取締案，決議通過。（五）陳參議員汝惠等擬請市府轉請尊師運動委員會，准將分配剩餘尊師獻金六千餘萬元，移充本市敎育貸金委員會，爲本屆九千餘名申請貸金生學費之用，敬請公決案，決議，送敎育局斟酌辦理。（六）吳參議員正矱提：擬請市府迅速遵照行政院命令將黃浦警察分局全部房屋撥與本市法院使用案。快議請市府迅速撥定相當房屋歸本市法院使用。（七）議長交議，本會宣言及對各局施政報吿決議案，文字擬推陶參議員百川，馮參議員有眞，姜參議員屛藩加以整理，再行分別發表，及轉送辦理案，決議通過。（八）議長交議本會本次大會未及討論之臨時動議案件，擬請分別交本會各專門委員會審議處理案，決議通過。（九）議長交議，本會本次大會接受各請願案，均交本會各專門委員會處理，送市府辦理案，決議通過。</p>
<h3>各種委員會　組織通則　修正通過</h3>
<p>參議會昨日上午修正通過「上海市參議會各種委員會組織通則」，共計十條。規定設自治，財政，地政，敎育，社會，警政，工務，公用，預算決算及法規等十一委員會。每委員會設召集人三人，每兩星期開會一次。各種委員會由參議員志願參加，但各參議員至少須參加一種，至多參加二種，各委員會之人數，最少應有十五人，最多不可超過三十五人。</p>
<h3>中統局區副主任　公事槍走火殞命</h3>

<h3>對市政當局採取不苛求不放鬆之態度　對市民負担抱定不浪費不吝惜之方針　第一次大會發表宣言</h3>
<p>本會成立於八一三滬戰紀念日，自本月九日召集會議以來，業已兩週又二日。依照本會議事程序，所有報吿，質詢，討論，決議諸項，均已次第完成，値茲大會休會之初，謹將本屆硏討經過及今後期望，擇其重要者。敬吿我全市父老曁市政當局。</p>
<p>上海自闢爲商埠以來，已有一百餘年之歷史，經多方努力經營之結果，久已成爲我國金融工商文化之重鎭，號稱遠東最繁榮之國際都市，惟過去因租界存在，治權分裂，地方自治，無法完成，民意機關，未能誕生。迺者抗戰勝利，國土重光，不平等條約廢止，上海市政，得吿統一。本會復於抗戰勝利一週年紀念日召開第一次大會，根據市參議會組織條例，代表全市人民，行使職權，而尤注重於預算決算之審核，對市政常局，採取不苛求不放鬆之態度，對市民負擔，抱定不浪費不吝惜之方針，市民猶之股東，本會猶之董監事，而市府則爲經理部，本會爲決定政策監督市府之機關，自當依照法規，充分行使其職權。　會議期間，本會曾聽取市府各局處及行政院上海各機關房屋分配委負會，善後救濟總署上海分署，蘇浙皖區敵僞產業處理局等機關之報吿、並提出質問，對於各種提案，亦經分別討論，作成決議，送請有關機關予以實施，其中與市民最有關係者，則爲審核三十五年下半年度市府預算，決議核减支出，酌加捐稅，以使收支得以平衡，目前幣値低落，物價動盪，百廢待舉，刻不容緩。財政爲庶政之母，欲期市政建設之舉辦，自非酌籌經費，不足以應需要。本會爲使市政經費與市民負擔得以兼籌並顧起見，小能不酌量接受市府之建議，舉辦新稅，惟新稅收入，經指定充作建設經費，以符取之於民用之於民之原則，至於行政經費，則力請市府儘量减少，繼續裁汰冗員，以節省不必要之支出，將來市府預算能否照此原則執行，本會決定採取嚴格之立塲，從事監督，並以此作爲考核市府工作之標準，今後市政建設旣有的款可供開支，當可期其逐步推進，發揚光大，使上海成爲國際性一之第一流都市。</p>
<p>本會休會以後，將設置十一委員會，協助議長，繼續行使職權，監督市府，聽取市民意見，市府各局處行政設施是否依照本會決議案辦理，各種委員會行將嚴加考核，盡力督促，以免決而不行之流弊。</p>
<p>本市經八年抗戰以後，工商凋敝，民生困頓，市政建設，百端待理，而挽救工商危機，解決房荒，整理交通，增設學校，尤屬當務之急，本會雖已竭其知能，通過若干解決辦法，其中關於挽救工商危機，促進復員建設，本會並已決議推派代表十一人，向中央請願，有所陳述，期能藉中樞之大力，促市面之復興，以加速完成三民主義新上海之建設，唯茲事體大，仍希我全體市民，共同負責，各盡其能，始克有濟。</p>
<p>上海爲一國際性都市，中外市民共計四百餘萬，其中友邦僑民，久居本市，視同第二故鄉者，頗不乏人，本會對於全市居民，不分國籍，不分職業，莫不一視同仁，無分畛域，市民對市政如有高見，務希隨時提供於各種委員會，本曾自當儘量接受，並提出報吿，以期勉盡人民喉舌之義務，對於本曾一切決議，尤望督促匡助，以期其成，市政幸甚，本會幸甚，謹此宣言。中華民國三十五年九月二十四日。</p>

<h3>南市引綫弄離奇命案　勒斃移來一女屍　襪底無泥頸繫手帕　帝遺雅梨半令菓糖兩片　成衣店夥曾聞男女爭吵</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕南市巡道街引綫弄（即前積孝坊）十六號前門　塲上，昨晨七時，發現無名女屍一具，頭南脚北，査死者年約廿七八歲，身服藍花白底布旗袍，內襯汗衫，短褲，黃色長統絲襪，無鞋，燙髮，金牙，頸項間繫有淡色手帕一條，口鼻內均有泥土。經居住十六號內少婦王施競男（餘姚人）開窗發現，遂報該弄十三甲甲長轉報蓬萊警局，當由姚分局長飭股長姚元龍率股員吳志鵬·王慕尹·警長童柏茶·房高山等按址前往，查得十六號後門外牆邊遺有女子玻璃束髮帶一條，屍旁遺有雅梨半只，水菓糖兩片，一時觀者如堵。事後分局方面呈報市警局，由攝影間派員到塲拍照，俾家屬認領，當攝取死者手印時，發覺右手無名指有戴長方形金戒痕跡，惟金戒已不翼而飛，並查得死者顯係被人勒斃，但所着襪子底面，均無汚穢泥潰，似有移屍之可能。旋據記者向附近調査，悉在出事前數小時，警廳路某裁縫店夥友微聞門外馬路上有男子二人，堅欲逼一女子返鄉，而女子則堅稱願以一死相爭，繼而其談話聲與爭吵聲，愈去愈遠，據一般推測，上項情形，似與此一謀殺案件大有關係。警局方面現正希望死者家屬前往認領屍體，俾能迅速破案。但至深夜，仍無人赴局領屍。當該屍橫陳於十六號大樹下之時，姚分局長曾召集第十六七及十八保各保甲長挨戶詢問，死者是否有人相識，但亦無一相識者。旋査傳各軍服廠工頭到塲，據稱各廠所雇用者，均係臨時短工，並無名册，惟死者面貌姣好，兩手手指並無做工之形狀，故此離奇命案，刻警方已指定警員二人，負責偵查緩索，限期破案。據測此一命案似又含有桃色成份云。</p>
<h3>陳國廉談話　沈克是敵俘</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕前日德納粹嫌疑犯沈克，控合衆社倫追爾誹謗案開審時，兩造律師曾就被遣送回國之德僑是否即爲「壞蛋」一點，爭執甚烈。記者昨特走訪外交部駐滬辦事處主任陳國廉氏，詢問究竟，陳氏答稱，我國遣送德僑時，實係視爲「敵俘」（Prisoners　of　War）而非「敵僑」，又該處前應合衆社之請證明沈克之身份時，僅陳述事實，並朱加以任何評語。西報所載該處指沈克爲“Obnoxious”（壞蛋）一點，殊與事實不符。</p>
<h3>代理納稅提貨　不防盡被截獲</h3>
<p>美軍官走私嫌疑續聞</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨日報載美軍官犯走私嫌疑案，涉及美籍名律師羅傑一事，據悉：羅傑當時實係受該軍官華納之委託，擬將提得之貨品，帶往海關繳納關稅，不意適於此際被截獲。緣美海軍上尉華納，因其父兄等服務於海外各地美軍中，藉職務上之便利，自美由軍郵局運滬大批奢侈品。最近曾運到尼龍玻璃絲襪，口紅，香水等物，分裝包裹十件，另信札一件。唯華納因其本人業已被美軍拘押，特致函美籍律師羅傑託其全權辦理一切提貨納稅等手續。初意以爲所犯罪嫌旣在走私，一旦照章向海關繳納稅款，當可依法提取。不意地檢處於事前早已獲有密報，業經派員會同海關曁警局方面，在北京路二號美海軍郵局門首守候，故當羅傑律師提得貨件用出郵局大門，即爲守候人員截獲云。</p>
<h3>淸查團結束期近　所有不及處理之案件　移各主管機關繼續辦理</h3>

<h3>强迫拖駁船登記　輪船業函請制止</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市內河輪船商業同業公會，近據該會各會員報吿，公用局曹家渡船舶登記所，會同警察局水上分局，向各拖駁船强迫登記，稍一違抗，甚至扣留船隻。但根據交通部拖駁船管理章程，對於大量檢査，由上海航政局主管，其船照由交通部頒發，故此項拖駁，自無須再向公用局辦理登記　該會已致函市商會，轉請市公用局査明制止，以維航運。</p>
<h3>其美輪昨已返滬　船長談被毆經過</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕招商局其美輪，此次由津載裝甲敎導總隊士兵四十八人來滬，轉赴徐州在大沽口候　，船長施學良深夜這該隊士兵無理毆打，該輪昨已返滬，肇事士兵，則已在塘沽離船。據該船長稱：對於此次遭受侮辱，個人事小，但對一般航海人員之保障，則關係殊大，除在津報吿憲軍外，並將經過情形，詳細報吿局方·一方復向駕駛員公會報吿，該會定日內通電全國，要求保障航海人員及懲兇。聞該局德經理徐學禹，亦將即日晋京，呈報國防部交通部等機關，要求懲戒肇　土兵。</p>
<h3>偽組織特工幹部之一　沈鳳崗昨午續審　沈樹寳周掄無案管轄錯誤　楊永瑞判處徒刑一年三月</h3>

<p>僞食汕業同業公會交際員楊永瑞，昨由高院判處有期徒刑一年三月，褫奪公權二年。</p>
<p>僞特工主要幹部之一沈鳳崗案，昨日下午在高院續審。沈現年卅五歲，阜寗人，民國二十八年由李楚琛領導來滬秘密工作，後爲敵所捕，即變節投僞。李楚琛於同年八月九日邀被吿至國泰飯店三〇二號房間，密商進行謀刺李士羣事宜，由沈担任內綫。孰料沈竟反將此訊報吿於李逆，旋將李楚琛等拘捕殺害。此外，並先後殺害中央黨部在滬行動員蘇紹陶，軍統局余延智等多人，遂因「功」升任僞特工總部第三處處長兼特務第一大隊長，迨李士羣發動江蘇淸鄉時，沈又出任淸鄉視察主任，並密報敵憲兵隊拘捕地下工作人員姜耀文等，經用鉅賄，始獲釋出。上次審訊時，被吿推翻一切在軍統局之口供，對各項罪狀無一承認。昨由王學農等證人多名，爲被吿作有利證明，該案改期再訊。</p>

<h3>橋頭推車亦有帮派　流浪小時兵求生受辱　手溜彈作護身符　却不料觸犯國法</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕靠着三輪車過橋推一把的所謂「推橋頭」之流，據說也有着帮派。因此在未加人這些帮派的流浪者，如果貿然想用自己的氣力，來　一些菲薄的辛苦錢，也會遭遇這種惡勢力的阻撓，甚至飽饗一頓老拳。</p>
<p>昨天淸早，北四川路橋，有一個十七歲的廣東孩子，名字叫熊泉玉，正在想推一下橋頭，却不料給一羣地頭蛇圍住了，聲勢汹汹，大興問罪之師，一定不准他「下海」。誰知這位小廣東州也不甘示弱，一轉身間居然帶來了一個手溜彈，聲言如果再欲非禮，那末唯有同歸於盡！</p>
<p>當然囉，手溜彈的効力很大。這一羣島合之衆，想不到他竟有驚人之筆，於是紛紛作鳥獸散。不過同時其中就有一個，去報吿了附近警察，將他拘到黃浦警察分局。一經訊問，他便供稱：「原本是個小兵，最近退伍，謀生未遂，流浪到上海來。臨走時，有一個陳舊的手溜彈未曾繳還。後來一想，這種危險品，帶在身邊，總覺不妥，因此到上海後，就將它埋藏在老閘橋堍。想不到這次爲了生活，意外受辱，一時情急，所以文將它掘了出來，用意是想演一齣「空城計」嚇嚇他們罷了，不想竟犯了私帶軍火之罪。」</p>
<p>犯法當然應受處分，所以警局依法將他解送法院，但等他將來恢復自由時，是否還有「推橋頭」的自由，却要看將來的事實，但如果再遭遇到挨打時，他已沒有手溜彈作護身符了。</p>
<h3>大票換小時票　捉獲兩騙子</h3>
<p>南通人楊敦厚，住南市福裕路望生坊五號，在福建路普慶里弄口擺設布攤爲業。本月二十日上午十時許，有身穿軍服之中年男子三人，以紅關金票兩扎，口稱爲二十萬元，向楊掉換小累，楊見彼衣冠楚楚，不疑有他，事先並不拆開點査，如數掉與五百元小票而去。迨後査點，發現外面爲一百元關金券，而內裏均爲五元或十元之法幣，但人已遠去，祗得徒喚奈何而已。昨日下午五時許，楊因事經過福州路山東路，見日前掉包之三人，又在該處向另一鄕人以前法掉換小票。乃上前將假戲拆穿，並將三人中之一扭住。鄕人亦帮同扭住一人，尙有一人，則被逸去。當將二人扭交老閘分局，經訊得一名孟寤生，廿七歲，河南人。一名高傑，卅一歲，安徽人。前曾充某部軍職，現已退役，於九月十一日，由徐州至無錫，日前來申，寓居西藏路遠東飯店四〇二號室。在逃者名史鼎文，直認以小票僞充詐欺鄕愚。並供於九月十九日上午十時許，以僞裝票十疊，在九江路金華街口向一不詳姓名之男子，掉得法幣廿萬元，於二十日上午以同樣方法向楊敦厚攤上，詐得二十萬。即於當日下午，三人乘火車赴杭遊玩。在杭狎娼，遊湖，於前日帶同杭州妓女黃琳弟來申，闢遠東四〇二號室。因錢已化盡，故於昨日又以同樣方法，向一鄉愚詐財。結果爲楊瞧見被捕云云。二犯經訊査究畢，今日移地檢處法辦。</p>
<h3>查贓無着　詐財有據　三警士　被起訴</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市警察局大塲分局便衣警士王春華，前稱査得中央化工廠有工人盜竊顏料出售於福州路蘇臺旅館內某號之旅客，乃於本年七月十三日下午七時邀合同局便衣警士楊祖福，周宏甫，至該館密査，發覺二二八號之房客爲顏料商，惟時客已外出，僅覩見房中顏料甚多。三警遂出。嗣在閘北兪家宅四十八號，捕獲譚阿福，吳金坤兩人，指有竊盜嫌疑，譚吳以時間太晚，懇求免拘，由保長担保其次日到局。翌日（十四日）上午，譚吳隨保長到局，由王春華等將比二人訊錄後，乃帶至蘇臺旅館二二八號吊贓。譚吳至此不認房中顏料係其竊賣，贓物無法吊出，王春華等即將譚吳二人毆打，並予扣押。吳情急當向王春華等許送一百萬元，以便了事，並由二二八號房客錢鏡水担保交款。當日下午八時許，譚吳兩家託謝明山送款四十五萬元至錢鏡水處，交由王春華等收，餘款的至次日（十五日）交淸。午後九時許，譚吳均被釋出。十五日上午，王等又至蘇臺旅館索取餘款，譚吳等乃佯言請至四馬路聚昌館飮酒，暗行報局，將王春華，楊祖福，周宏甫等三人拘獲，移解地撿處偵查起訴。昨在地院開審，三被吿均否認，庭諭改期再審。</p>
<h3>大學畢業生李肇和　竊飛機零件被控　竟供稱「一時好奇携歸硏究」</h3>

<h3>聯合國文敎科學委會　國際敎育計劃　準備在中國發動力敎育運動力</h3>
<p>〔英國新聞處倫敦廿四日電〕聯合國文敎科學委員會，日昨在巴黎開設一新總部，惟在該委員會二百萬磅之預算案，在十一月中於聯合國會議中討論以前，法國政府仍將充當主人。在過去十月中，該委員會總部設於倫敦，由英國政府給予津貼，而其秘書處人員，則由英國文化委員會派員充任。事實上該委員會之創立，係英政府發起，蓋英政府曾於一九四二年召開聯合國敎長會議一次，其首任主席，即由英國敎育部大臣魏金遜小姐担任。首任秘書長，則爲著名英國歷史學家及國際敎育家秦美爾爵士。其後秦美爾爵士，因病請辭該職，即由著名英國生物學家及社會學家赫胥居博士繼任。在最近一次廣播演說中，赫胥尼博士曾以聯合國文　科學委員會，克服全世界精神饑荒及心靈窮困之工作，與聯合國糧食及農業機構，爭服肉體飢荒及窮因之工作相比擬。聯合國文敎科學委員會在倫敦時期中，在工作上曾有偉大之成就。該委員會曾草擬在歐洲及遠東各遭遇戰　　國家，從事科學敎育及文化救濟之計劃，並準備在墨西哥，中國，　聯，土耳其，及甚多殖民地發動敎育運動。該委員會並已開始硏究歷史，地理，及公民三科敎科書之編訂，偉消除國際　擦及誤會之根源。此外該委員會正準備在歐洲召開敎育廣播會議，調査藝術在一般敎育中之功能，並企圖組成一優良之翻譯機稱。而長期計劃亦甚衆多，計有利用電影，便利師生敎育之計劃，在中印二國組織成年敎育討論會之計劃，以及設立一國際大學，國際靑年營，國際家庭及社會設計協會，國際戲劇協會，與國際應用數學協會之計劃。以上不過係聯合國文敎科學委員會在倫敦十個月中成就之若干例子而已。</p>

<h3>謠諑紛紜·買風銳厲　美鈔已出四千大關　最高曾做四三八零元　金價亦被帶漲四萬餘</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕外匯謠傳，雖經當局一再聲明，但於事實仍無一裨益，昨日外幣買戶興奮有加，美鈔晨開三八九〇元有供，一度低至三八六〇元，買氣即漸發動，不久穿出四千大關。買戶再接再厲，於是供方吿絕，甚至謠傳即日起，美匯掛牌有調整爲四二〇〇元之說，又謂須提高至五〇〇〇元，午刻美鈔竟飛漲至四三八〇元，午後略有多方了結，同至四一〇〇元內，結果較前收又昂二六〇元，對黃金之比價軋攏至五三六元強對十兩，港票混亂，曾昂至八五〇元左右，午後稍固，結果較前收好起五〇元，港匯初平後堅，午後小　爲八〇〇至八二〇元，印匯一〇〇〇元，英匯一三〇〇〇元，美匯對做已寂。</p>
<p>烚赤亦逐步邁進，縱有管制，無濟於事，晨開二一八萬七有售，浮多有所了給，曾見降至二一七萬元，美鈔方面又來助買，立被帶上至二二〇萬外，迨漲到二二三萬左右，始被遏微挫，十時後央行以二二一萬之價配給一〇〇條，此際頗爲平和，迨美鈔再吿俏利，謠諑繁興，復被激漲，午刻站二二六萬高價，午後美鈔同小，金市失去聲援，隔日交割回落至二二三萬以下，結果較前收漲四萬元，飾金掛高至念三萬七，紋銀銀元平平，暗拆以投機銷路吿殷，銀根微緊，暗息升至一角半左右。</p>
<h3>華股市况豁然開朗　漲停板達七種之多</h3>
<p>華股昨有大批金融帮下手進提，局勢一變，北帮亦有補空，惟中途以檯面帮存多獲利了結，一度見回，十一時後脚地見穩，各路買戶奮起，十一時半後始形轉俏，大中華火柴在二二五號中匯銀行購買下，首先見紅，告漲至停板價，於是信和在一五七號，中紡在二三二號，景綸大通水泥在一九八號，景福在三六號及二二四號，內衣在四二號及四號等購買下，陸續在十一時三刻左右，先後哄高至停板，兩大熱以及各小股亦迫近最高限度，近午獲利多頭湧出，頗有　小，美亞自四四六〇元，一轉瞬間曾回跌至四三〇〇元光景，臨收仍能站定，人心飛俏，檯面改觀，最後數十分鐘內之交易，頗多好奇性之哄抬，獲利之大戶，亦稍有脫手者，結果較前收計永紗美亞景福新光勤興都回漲一成半左右，冷門中統益五和織造微升半成，華豐升一成弱，中紡信和大通內衣景綸新亞公司麗安火柴絲業水泥各漲一成半至二成不等，成交總額計達九·七六四·八〇〇股，內永紗爲四〇五萬股，景福新光各一五〇萬股左右，信和六六四·〇〇〇股，美亞勤興各計四五十萬股。塲外各股以時間不及，祇有微升。</p>
<h3>公債回漲</h3>
<p>公債初時依然平疲，近午受華股影響，亦起買風，統丙晨開一八一〇元曾低至一七六〇元而後始平，呆滯甚久，最後因受華股方面之間接鼓動，回漲至二一五〇元而後稍定，結果較前收漲起三三〇元，甲乙升二八〇元，丁好一八〇元，戊種亦升二三〇元，成交僅票面四百餘萬元。</p>
<h3>外股亦回升</h3>
<p>外股有西商來購，亦現穩健，但因證券帮仍未活動，作風不逮華股，怡紗自八千九升至九千五，而後稍回，結果較前收計怡紗英聯各漲一成，餘者均被帶好半成光景。</p>
<h3>征收交易稅</h3>
<p>昨日證交通吿各經紀人，決於今日起開徵交易稅，略謂，證券交易稅條例，業經國府於本月廿日明令公佈，依據該條例第八條規定，應自公佈之日起施行，惟部令尙未正式奉頒，若俟令到實施，則追溯補繳手續棼繁，頃奉監理員辦公處函知，自應自本年九月廿五日起開征，望各經紀人一體知照云。</p>
<h3>陳茶銷路頗暢</h3>
<p>海外茶市，對於新貨嫌貴，對於陳茶尙有胃口，最近屢次來電，囑擇廉裝運，故各行爭相扒取，尤以祁紅脫手更順，售價亦一再進展，結果高低各貨，每担比前軋升一萬五千元至二萬元不等，他若白琳新紅茶亦隨見隨銷，此外陳抽珍陳特貢等，不乏做開，至於內銷則溫州粗毛紅求者益股，其他花色，過程悉帶秀色。</p>
<h3>生砂赤回升</h3>
<p>昨糖市無甚軒輊，惟生砂赤以連日步跌過甚，已見四好，公會劃現貨中砂白爲十三萬七千元，生砂赤初爲十一萬八千元，後爲十一萬九千五百元，升五千餘元，汕頭帮開出黃崗靑數百包，十一萬五千元，建帮開泉州次白十三滅一千元至十二萬八千元，泉州洋十二萬五千元，刁靑十萬零九千元。</p>
<h3>桐油銷美總額</h3>
<p>本年祗一萬三千噸　美商運新機械來華</p>
<p>〔路透社紐約廿三日電〕本年內運抵美國之中國桐油祇有五六千噸，本年度總額大的不致超過一萬三千噸。在戰前一年中，輸入之中國桐油的七萬五千噸，甚至在一九四〇年，雖受日本侵略影響，亦輸入四萬八千五百噸。姑勿論中國桐油產量較戰前爲低，其所產桐油大部份配售至歐洲。昔日輸入美國之桐油佔中國全部產量百分之七十五至八十，今則已减至百分之五十。美國爲協助增加中國桐油之產量起見，已由舊金山某商行將配備齊全之新式榨油設備運往中國。</p>

<h3>紗布均瘋狂上漲　紡建配額太少配價又提高　廠商以原料難補不願脫手</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨日紗市漲風再接再厲緣金鈔均吿狂漲，紗市開盤一跳十萬，賣戶稀少，旋文逐步高翔五七萬，買客不惜加價吸收，人心之昂，得未曾見，結果廿支較上日漲十五萬至念萬，尤以廿支中小製紗，幾與大廠之雙馬大發金鷄並駕齊驅，十六支紗更爲出色，亦做一百七十五七萬，與廿支同價而沽，其原因爲前昨紡建方面配銷價格劇升，而供應之數量極微，且退單者衆，遂致市塲形成有求無供之狀，以本街及織廠之採辦又甚殷，求供失衡，高漲之勢，瀰漫於市塲矣，綜觀各支紗線又升一成上下，趨勢仍極堅穩，布市晨開，人心仍極堅昂，而紡建開售價格，坏布較上期又增近萬元，爲七萬二千元，市塲一般人士，以爲紡建開價迭增，促成黑市之劇漲，人心惶惑，白印嗶嘰竟狂升到七萬八千元之高峯，於是市塲市面波動更烈，民營各廠，因原料難進，相率不願以僅存之半製品，輕於拋售，必須俟補進原料以後，方可供應於市，實銷商補貨遂益困難，况外匯黑市甚漲至四三〇〇元光景，以是人心更形忐忑，甚望紡建常局對於承購單之申請額，能予以普遍增多，則市價　能於瘋狂上漲之局勢下趨於平定歟，本日藍V細布做八萬二千元，四君子老貨嗶嘰九萬元，五福細布八萬元。</p>
<h3>購買日繭遭拒絕　中蠶表明態度　購額甚微不能壟斷日繭　日方指摘各節不成理由</h3>
<p>中蠶公司購買日本蠶繭，遭麥帥總部拒絕，總部紡織顧問馬加納並聲明我勾結美商人，圖壟斷日本蠶絲圖利之計劃。詞句極爲鋒利，已引起我朝野之驚異，我官方人士，對馬加納之聲明尤深表遺憾，中蠶公司總經理葛敬中氏聲明如下：（一）中蠶公司係政府爲發展絲業，輔導民營改進之機構，並非商營組織。（二）宋院長從未參與該公司事宜，僅爲復興我戰後蠶絲事業尤准設立公司。</p>
<p>戰期中絲業　我損失慘重</p>
<p>（三）我國蠶絲業，抗戰時期，損失極重，戰前有絲車三萬餘部，現僅一萬另五百部，生產機器及設備，損失三分之一。戰前江浙兩省蠶繭可產十萬担，現春秋兩季蠶繭，不過七萬餘担，原料生產减六分之一，僅足半年之用，尙缺半年原料，故我急需日本議繭。去年農林部接收蠶絲特派員陸錫祥，（現任中蠶副總經理），到滬接收時，即與美大使館農業參贊陶森商得同意，購買蠶種三十萬張，桑苗二百萬株，以作復興蠶絲之用，經轉呈杜魯門總統批准。</p>
<p>買蠶種桑苗　得美國同意</p>
<p>飭交麥帥總部，以交換方式辦理，於本年三月始吿成功。因我在戰時蠶絲損失重大，原料缺乏，工廠有停工之虞，公司站在復興我國蠶絲之立塲，本年四月，特委托我駐日代表團朱世明將軍，購買日本蠶繭，幾經交涉，未獲結果，竟吿停　·據悉：日方以我絲質低劣，迭有工潮發生，燃料又吿不足，不願售與我方，但以上諸點，均不成理由。如謂我品質低劣，而我在歐美之市塲，品質並不低於日絲。我絲廠向無工潮發生。假使燃料不足，絲廠亦未停工。本公司爲解救蠶絲危機，三週前再度請求我代表團繼續交涉，並供給各種損失調査統計材料，仍採物物交換方式，詎料竟有馬氏之聲明發生，深爲遺憾。（四）馬氏謂我與美政客及工業家，有壟斷日本絲業之言。査我此次所購日本蠶繭一千萬磅，不過日本存踏百分之十一，僅合新繭存繭百分之六，麥帥總部握有鉅量日本蠶繭，吾人何能壟斷。</p>
<p>蠶絲業損失　應由日賠償</p>
<p>（五）我戰時蠶絲之損失，應由日本賠償；今爲　救蠶絲之危機，維持工人生計起見，而以易貨方式，購買日蠶繭，於情於理，麥帥總部均不應拒絕，在朱接我代表團之報吿前，吾人對馬氏所言，僅能視爲私人言論，吾人應繼續向麥帥總部交涉，以期獲得成功爲止。</p>

<h3>大衣呢暢銷</h3>
<p>大衣呢客帮續有需要，零躉走銷均盛，行情因賣買雙方手貨枯薄，來路貨運到無多，大半尙未裝船，待進口爲時已遲，故價皆堅俏，惟下檔元常大衣呢類，始終平疲，蓋受麥爾登之影響，客戶需要甚寡，昨英製開水咪大衣呢每碼喊沽十六萬元，日製開水味八萬五千元，亞培五萬元，美國大衣呢四萬七千五百元，石利洛五萬五千元，美豐五萬二千五百元，次號人字二六五爲三萬三千元。</p>
<h3>工業原料　價格飛漲　定貨中斷</h3>
<p>自外匯調整以後，工業原料，多數僅漲一二成，但亦有因實銷缺乏而價反較下跌者，最近美鈔黑市，激烈上升，各項原料，銷路又復不惡，是以昨日市盤一致飛揚，熱門貨燒碱每桶上漲七萬元，他如純碱·漂粉精·凡士林·N松香，亦各上漲一二成不等。據悉，九月份工業原料商向國外定貨，可謂絕無僅有，據業中人云其原因約有三點：（二）國外定貨價格較滬市現貨價値爲高，行商存貨銷化不易，故多數　積存底貨，不向國外訂購。（二）國外裝運貨物困難未曾解除，到貨日期，無法迅速，故定貨不如購囤現貨。（三）進口貨到滬之後，往往外費與貨價相仿，如價値較大之貨物，則提運設卸費用，尙可劃算，倘　體　大價値輕者，則往往有棄之不甘，提之太費之歎。</p>

<h3>美機在南境被擊落後　華府政策的蛻變</h3>
<p>— 本報駐美特派員　毛樹溥航訊</p>
<p>狄托前倨後恭書面懺悔</p>
<p>〔本報九月三日紐約訊〕美蘇外交始終在曲折迂迴地前進。南斯拉夫擊落美國運輸機的一幕，是美國對蘇態度上的一個轉捩點，在這一慕「悲劇」演出以前，不少美國人在響往著共產主義，儘管共產主義國家的政治作風，和美國高哇的「民主」截然相反，但是，像　樂思之流（杜威的外交顧問），仍然主張脫去了美國「民主」的外交，委曲求全的去認識蘇聯，去了解比次本主義社會更「前進」的共產主義，就外交的技術上講：華萊士之流的人物，主張與「蘇聯集團」修好，以求建立爲正的和平，就內政的途程上講，他們主張效決蘇聯經濟平等的長處，以改造美國本身。</p>
<p>左傾外次努力髮冲冠　太平宰相泛舟垂釣　　但是，南斯拉夫的悲劇，正面地打擊了美國的左傾幻想家，代理國務卿艾契遜先生，是美國外交界中以左傾起家的人物，飛機被擊落的第二天，我正在華盛頓，在國務院的記者招待會上，我看見他漲紅了臉，報吿那一幕悲劇的經過，以及美國政府的緊急措置，那一天，太平宰相杜魚門總統，去海上釣魚去了，國務卿貝爾納斯，遠在巴黎開會，艾契遜的責任，因之也特別重大，他的八字鬍子，他的英國紳士派頭的言語和舉止，使華盛頓四週的空氣，像一塊鉛壓著人們的心頭一樣。</p>
<p>民主政治的基礎是輿論，輿論界對南斯拉夫的悲劇，怒吼了起來。最激烈的是赫斯脫系的報紙，紐約的美洲紀事報，刋出了在南斯拉夫的殉難的空中英雄的照片，標題上寫著：「難道讓他們的生命，白白送掉」？第二天，紀事報刋出了烈士家屬接到噩耗以後的哀痛，施烈勃（死者之一）上尉的母親，伏著桌上，號啕大哭。紀事報的編者註解者：「狄托，注意，你說美國的飛行員，忽視你的領空完整，但是，狄托，你却忽視了成千成萬的美國母親的心」！第三天，賓夕法尼亞洲的康郭上士的家庭，接得了康郭上士的死訊，紀事報刋出了康郭全家悲憤欲絕的相片，並且摘引了死者家屬要求「懲罰兇手」的話，相片旁加了一欄，編者寫道：「八月十九日，狄托紅色法西斯的劊子手，無端擊落了美國非武裝的運輸機，謀殺了我們五位空中健兒，……這些健兒們，他們出生入死，作載了好幾年，打敗了軸心敵國，現在勝利了，他們正預備要享受和平的幸福生活之時，突然被狄托强盜殺死了！</p>
<p>「讓我們的政府明白：他們之死，是爲服從命令而死，是爲盡忠職守而死，我們是民主國家，我們每一個國民的生命，都是無價之寳。我們的政府，難滬不能讓狄托明白，難道不能把狄托及其共產强盜，看一看法律的顏色嗎？</p>
<p>「要政府力爭，將凶手送交國際法庭，像一般殺人犯一樣，治以應得的懲罰——」。</p>
<p>共產黨惟强者是懼　美報反對原子公開</p>
<p>美洲紀事報動員了一個多星期，爲南期拉夫的悲劇一伸寃」，其他的，世界電訊報，紐約每日新聞，都一致「申討」狄托的瘋在行動。一向態度非常左傾的紐約「下午報」，也大聲疾呼的要政府堅定對南斯拉夫的指責。「狄托」一個字，現在成了紐約各報常見的封面，狄托的照相，像從前希特勒一樣，被用作各色各樣的方式刋登著。在許多報紙上，狄托的名字前面，加上一條「共產傀儡首腦」，或「史達林的傀儡政機」等等　樣。</p>
<p>國務院的態度，也在跟著輿論走，第一次我看見艾契遜的時候，他祇要求釋放幾名被狄托囚禁的飛行員，狄托政府，經過莫洛托夫在巴黎的指示，遵照釋放了，第二次，艾契遜要狄托道歉，並且保證以後不再有同樣情事，狄托也照辦了。第二次，艾契遜要狄托給死難者以榮譽，舉行盛大的追悼儀式，狄托派了南斯拉夫的陸軍第四軍送葬追悼，也照辦了。以後，國務院又要求狄托必須書面「懺侮」，並保證以後不再有同類事情，須繕成文字，送美國國務院備案，據說，狄托也寫了。但是美國的民意和與論，仍然沒有平復，因此，艾契遜又要求狄托賠償與撫卹，預料，也一定會照辦。</p>
<p>有位美國記者說。對付共產黨及其走狗，是要一棍子打得它翻不身來，他說：「好人讓一步，惡狗進兩步，好人還一脚，惡狗便非逃跑不可了」。</p>
<p>我不知道南斯拉夫人民，對這件事的看法怎樣？在美國，美國人把他比作珍珠港事變的縮影。美國人現在了解了：什麽叫眞正的和平？勞工節那天，日銷四百六十萬份的紐約每日新聞，寫了一篇社評，紀念勞工節及勝利節，最後的結語，說：「如果現在我們把原子彈的製造秘密，吿訴了另一國家，那我們無異全身赤裸」！美國人民是否同意這句話呢？一半以上的答案，是屬於正面的！（九月三日於紐約）</p>
<h3>瑞典歷史大賭劇　演出的塲所　偽裝中立妙計助盟國</h3>
<p>— 乘之譯自九月份讀者文摘</p>
<p>第二次世界大戰中，在斯干的那維亞島上，演出一幕歷史的大賭劇，至今還祗有幾個高級英美要員瞭解，這　來認爲傾向納粹的瑞典，從戰爭爆發以來，就不斷的以重要軍需品，及有關各種情報，援助　合　。</p>
<p>祗有兩瑞典高級官吏知道，所有瑞典情報機關所收獲之重要情報，都送往聯合國使館，這包括希特勒總部內每日之行動，V一的詳情。</p>
<p>瑞典完全包圍在德國勢力之下，所以她祗能佯爲中立，但是在戰爭的第一年就有大批的滾軸，及其他賣重設備偸運到英美，一九四〇年有一種劃時代的新武器——波福斯四〇公分口徑之高射砲——由瑞典偸運到美國，此後美國絡續仿造了數千門之多，瑞典高級將領在漆黑的軍械庫裏，滿頭大汗地爲挪威地下工作者，將機關槍，手溜彈等偸偸地裝箱打包。</p>
<p>經過多星期的調査，我纔知祗有商業，政府領袖之一小部分，參與這秘密工作，並深信德國必敗無疑。同情德國的當然亦不乏其人，少數的海陸將領就被認爲傾向納粹的。</p>
<p>納粹堅持着要吸收瑞典全部出口貨，但是她堅決的反對，她要的是完全自由貿易，納粹更要求比戰前更多的鐵料，瑞典非但拒絕，並且實在倒减少四分之一。</p>
<p>自戰爭初起以來，瑞典的情報工作就是歐洲最準確可靠的一個。</p>
<p>瑞典的情報頗得力於不少歧視希特勒的德國高級官員，</p>
<p>一九四〇年三月卅日某醫師造訪瑞典商人S先生，彼爲希特勒一幕僚之至友，得悉納粹將於四男九日進犯斯的干那維亞，進攻所需各項船隻已集中於北部之斯得丁港。</p>
<p>瑞典官員不敢輕易置信，信疑參半。</p>
<p>翌日下午斯得丁港內有一羣敎堂長老跟往常一樣享受星期日之散步，漸漸潛入海邊，探悉大批工人在四十艘船隻上裝載軍需品，情報員立刻通知在柏林之瑞典，挪威各公使，那夜S先生又從希總部中得來德軍進攻挪威丹麥——而不是瑞典——的消息。</p>
<p>挪京丹京各外交人員都不置信於此項情報，挪外長特往訪德大使，他還絕對保證此項船隻之預備爲侵犯荷蘭比利時之用，可是屋期二淸早挪京人民爲大砲隆隆聲而驚醒他們的酣夢。</p>
<h3>保守中立　拒絕納粹假道</h3>
<p>此後瑞典輿論譁然，反德聲調日高，而希特勒猜忌之心亦日增，於是瑞政府，派遣半官性之外交團至柏林向希特勒保證瑞典絕對遵守中立，但是附帶的警吿是假使一旦德國進攻瑞典，則每個軍事工業礦業運輸交通設備不惜立刻自動澈底破壞。</p>
<p>希特勒再度要求假道鐵路，接濟那維克區糧食，醫藥，及紅十字會人員。這要求在逼不得已之下允許，但是很多戰鬥人員偽飾紅十字會人員經過，都被拘留，此外德國復要求每列火車都附掛數節免予檢査之軍需車，瑞典立刻予以拒絕。德國爲採取恐嚇手段起見，派出一大隊德機翱翔於瑞典南部上空，瑞典不爲所動，並擊毀其七架：</p>
<p>聯軍那維　　登陸順利進行，擲北　中德軍形勢至此已顯得異常不利，里賓特落　通知瑞典政府假使軍隊假道要求再遭拒絕，則德國不惜犧牲友誼而進攻瑞典，以解德軍在挪倒懸之危。</p>
<p>五月十七日之夜內閣又召集緊急會議，其時城內一大部分已經疏散，交界處則警戒森嚴，通連挪境之橋樑都一律炸毀，形勢之嚴重可知，在會議中漢遜首相態度嚴肅言語激昂，他是個穩重靜穆的人物，可是最後他演說的聲調漸漸發顫「……假使我們拒絕。那末我們可能立即被侵而淪陷，假使允許，那末挪威將爲我們的世仇」。停了一停他又接着說「不過我以爲寗可玉碎而不願瓦全，所以這無理要求一定要拒絕他」。</p>
<p>全體同意沒有一票反對。</p>
<p>一九四二年春德國又籌劃進攻瑞典，希特勒需要瑞典鐵道以爲對蘇大戰之交通運輸綫。正月裏籌備計劃也吿完成，預備調集丹麥挪威及德國北部之軍隊四十五師分海陸共同進犯，日期亦已擇定於二月下旬。但是正月底瑞典接獲情報，立即全國動員，陳兵以待。</p>
<p>德布克將軍於柏林希總部大發雷霆，蓋瑞典情報人員以將彼等行動透露無遺，故要求非另加廿師則不足以攻克喘典。此時希特勒正努力從事於對蘇大戰，以一時不遑另撥此軍隊而作罷論，瑞典賴以得以全盤。</p>
<h3>地下活動　護送原子專家</h3>
<p>瑞典與丹麥挪威之地下工作者之驚人事蹟眞有令人拍案叫絕之妙，他們最初的偉績是設法引導丹麥物理學家巴爾脫險至瑞典，再輾轉赴美國。此次硏究原子炸彈，他就是發展過程中之重要人物。</p>
<p>一九四三年德國決定殘殺在丹麥的八千五百餘名的猶太人，瑞典的情報人員已於十日前獲悉此項消息，於是他們設法傳語這輩猶人，令他們每晚聚集於對瑞南的摩爾馬海岸邊以便營救。</p>
<p>這星光燦爛之夜間，眞是一個不可思議景情，他們乘着划的船，竹筏，木筏，木門，木板甚而游泳。在驚浪怒濤中飄流東來，他們都是面色慘白，靜默寡言，蓋深恐一旦驚動德軍，則務必全體遭殃也。瘦弱的女子，滿臉于思的男人，以及發抖着的孩童每晚都是成千的蜂湧而來，瑞典海軍偸派出無數武裝小船，在洶湧浪濤中巡邏着，以備德人之干涉，差不多一星期內全部在丹麥的猶太人均抵達瑞典。</p>
<p>時事評述</p>
<h3>一個世界乎？兩個世界乎？</h3>
<p>— 儲玉坤</p>
<p>在上一星期內，華萊士發表演說，引起了美國外交界的軒然大波；後經杜魯門總統發表聲明，始吿平息。但是華萊士於八月廿三日上總絲函，又在美國各報發表，使海陸兩部長，也深感不安，不得不致函總統，予以否認。因此美國政府內部的裂痕，更加深刻，無法彌補，使杜魯門總統不得不有所抉擇了。</p>
<p>邱又鼓吹法德合作</p>
<p>華萊士所引起的波浪尙未完全平息，而邱吉爾於十八日又在瑞士發表演說，主張法德兩國應釋嫌修好，以兩國合作爲基礎，建立歐洲聯盟。他說：「重建歐洲的第一步，必須由法德共同合作；惟其如此，法國始能恢復其在歐陸的領導權；若無偉大的德國，歐洲即不能復興」</p>
<p>邱吉爾雖已退出英國政界，息影瑞士，優游歲月，但以其本人的聲望而論，他的言論主張，仍爲各國所重視。我們對於他主張法德合作，在原則上自無反對的理由；但是邱吉爾在一年內，先後發了好幾次演說，第一次在美國，主張英美合作；又有一次在法國，主張英法同盟；這一次在瑞士，又鼓吹法德合作，把他道些主張聯合起來，當不免要令人懷疑邱氏有組織西方集團以抵抗蘇聯的企圖。我們是希望國際和平與合作的，對於將地球劃分爲兩個世界的任何主張，我們却不能隨便附和的。</p>
<p>華氏辭職繼續奮斗</p>
<p>邱吉爾對於一兩個世界」的呼聲還沒有消失我們又聽到華萊士爲「一個世界」而吶喊。杜魯門總統於十九日與國務卿貝爾納斯通話之後，便決定命令華萊士辭職。據杜魯門總統解釋理由稱：「政府仍擁護國務卿貝爾納斯所採取的外交政策，國人固然可以絕對自由發表對於政府政策不贊同的意見；但在政府本身，必須保持一致。而今華萊士部長與政府發生「根太衝突」，至爲明顯；唯一的解決辦法，厥爲由　氏辭職。同時余亦相信華氏寗願以公民資格，自由發表其意見。」華萊士當即奉命辭職，並不沮喪，且很樂觀地說：「余決定繼續爲和平面奮鬥，余相信美國人民，均能以故總統羅斯福的英勇精神，加入余所領導的鬥爭。」</p>
<p>一個世界始能和平</p>
<p>華氏辭職後，即可自由發表其主張，乃於二十日發表演說，起初說明他辭職的理由：他說：「爭取和平，較之高官厚祿，尤爲重要。」接着說明他對於「一個世界」的理想。他說：「余不贊成將地球分爲兩個世界，而今將繼續主張生活於一個世界的一項原則，除了「一個世界」而外，即無和平可言。」同時他又指摘美國政府外交政策的錯誤，謂其未能認淸引起兩次世界大戰的「基本事實」，而今又復威脅第三次大戰矣。但第三次大戰將爲「原子戰爭」。這一個嚴重的警吿，是値得主張「兩個世界」的人們深思的。</p>
<p>巴黎和會陷於僵局</p>
<p>和會秘書長社巴克依照四國外長會議的決定，親定和會所有各委員會，均須於十月五日以前完成工作，俾使聯合國大會如期舉行，但是還有許多困難問題，尙未解決：其中最重要的有（一）特里雅斯特區問題；（二）義大利前有之殖民地處置問題；（三）巴爾幹多瑙河自由航行問題，（四）義大利賠款間題，已有十四國提出賠款要求，均未解決。</p>
<p>美將努力和會成功</p>
<p>美國國務卿貝爾納期，在國內雖已獲得勝利，但是其所面臨的困難，依然存在。因此貝氏不得不加倍努力，務使和會成功。否則其地位必將動搖。所幸，四國外長均在巴黎，外長會議可望重開，使這些懸案早日解決。如果外長會議仍不能解決問題，則杜魯門與史丹林會晤，也是非常可能的。（九月廿三日）</p>
<h3>第二次大職中歐洲各國人口增减情形各國均减德國獨增</h3>
<h3>嚴重的問題！　戰後德國　土地縮小　人口增加</h3>
<p>— 譯自紐約時報雜誌　　南</p>
<p>國際硏究歐洲問題委員會最近在倫敦開會，許多歐洲國家的專家都趕往參加，當時討論的主題是第二次世界大戰對於德國和歐洲聯合各國人口的影響。該委員會提出了一個報吿，其中開頭一句就說：「德國國社黨不但要征服領土，同時想增加德國的人口削弱鄰近國家的人口，因此可以在未來的歲月中，保持德國民族的優勢」。</p>
<p>希特勒很早就抱着這種目的，他和他手下的德國人許多年來在許多方面向着這個目標前進。他們的辦法是在戰前就鼓勵結婚獎勵生育，因此可以在戰爭開始之後擁有充份的「生物後備軍」；盡力改善防空設備保護平民；設法維持相當的配給量，以謀保持人民的健康；在戰爭時期維持平時的出生率。此外還有一點是最値得注意的，就是聯合各國大多徵用女子參加軍事和工廠裏的工作，而德國女子却不受强迫服役的限制，因此她們可以繼續生育德國人。</p>
<p>我們祇要比較一下第一次世界大戰和第二次世界大戰對於德國出生率的影響，就可以發現顯著的不同。在第一次世界大戰四年間，德國的出生率較平時四年減少三百萬人，而在第二次世界大戰的最初四年中，德國的出生率祇減少了七十五萬人。</p>
<p>此外，德國在戰時的死亡人數也比歐洲各國爲少。德國軍民的死亡總數，大的爲三百六十萬人，至於反對德國的歐洲諸國，其軍民死亡總數約在一千五百四十萬左右。</p>
<p>除了儘量屠殺作戰人員之外，德國還用直接問接的方法去殺害和虐待他們心目中認爲不可取的猶太人和被佔領各國人民，因此使德國敵對國家的人民更共損失得多。</p>
<p>德國在人口戰爭方面果然是勝利了，可是在領土戰爭方面却失敗了。照蘇聯和波蘭替德國所定的東方國境看，她就損失了四分之」的土地，但是德國的人口却有七千二百萬人左右，比一九三五年的人口六千七百萬人顯有增加。德國人口增加的重要原因之一，就是原來在國外的德國人，逐漸遣返本國，結果是在四分之三的土地上要容納比以前更多的人口，這在戰後的歐洲，確然是一個嚴重的問題。</p>
<p>在第二次世界大戰之前，德日義三個軸心國家曾經高唱土地狹小人口衆多，作爲侵略別國的張本。這種藉口將來當然不能容許它再存在。事實上，德國人口的密度，並不比英國或者比利時來得密，祇要德國人努力去開發自己的土地充份發揮他們內在的能力，仍舊可以建設一個安定繁榮的國家。不過目前德國四分五裂的情形以及東西間的阻隔，的確使德國的正常發展非常困難，甚至有形成嚴重危機的可能。這種情形，一方面固然不是德國人之福，但在另一方面已決不是聯合各國之福。所以歐洲各國的政治家應該抱遠大的目光審愼的態度使德國間題獲得合理的解決，這對於歐洲的將來，顯然具有權決定的作用。</p>

<h3>地窟中的故事</h3>
<p>— 沈默</p>
<p>殘秋，太陽射出　最後的微弱的光，拖着沉重疲乏的身子，隱入了西邊的山坳。天邊一抹紅光，褪成淡灰色。天，黑了下來。</p>
<p>村莊，經過了砲火的洗禮，一切都是荒凉的氣象，尤其古老的梅家莊，更顯得頽廢破敗。莊前塲上，沒有人，祇　着一條垂死的老狗蜷曲了身子，在黃昏的西風裏瑟縮悲泣。</p>
<p>莊上，破舊的木板的門戶，全都鎖起來了；祇梅老大家的門，却還開着。門裏，顫抖昏黃的燭光下，許多人在默默地坐着。身旁，放着各人的舖蓋。空氣是那麽沉寂。</p>
<p>「怎還不來呢？……天黑了。」坐近門口的年老的梅老大顯得焦灼，抓抓在燭光下顯出秃亮的頭皮，懊惱地咕嚕着。</p>
<p>一個月前，桂子飄香的季節，日本人開始進佔了這地方。於是，殺人·放火·姦淫·擄掠……，便無時不在他們手中製造出來；也無時不在吞噬着每個活人的心。他們覺到種種不幸都將在自己頭上發生，同時惑到死亡的黑影緊緊地壓榨着他們……。</p>
<p>多少可憐的人，無故地被殺掉；多少可憐的人，被燒掉了房屋，甚至喪失了生命。……</p>
<p>梅家莊，小小的村落，雖還有遭受到什麼不幸，然而一到夜裏，慘厲的鎗聲，哀怨的哭聲，呼救的　聲……。誰都睡不成。</p>
<p>因此，有人發起掘地窟，夜裏住在地窟裏。大家一想道法子還不錯，因爲地窟總比家裏安穩得多，夜裏儘可以安穩睡覺，用不着擔虛驚。這樣，地窟便開成了。</p>
<p>今天，——地窟開成的第一天，大家本可以早就到地窟裏去，但是他們還在等待一個人——啕小六。他是莊上所熟悉的游擊隊員。因爲他對於住在地窟裏這件事發生了好奇心，於是他要求也加入他們的集團，住到地窟裏去。大家，還有什麽不可以答允的？一方面是熟人，又因爲他有傢伙，至少可以肚壯大家的膽。</p>
<p>「來了——喂！……來了，小六——」梅老大忽然轉過頭來對大家說。</p>
<p>門外，昏黑的天。灰色田埂上，一個黑影匆匆走向村子來。</p>
<p>陶小六走進屋子。燭光照出他結實的身子，年輕還帶些孩子氣。然而顯出堅決，果敢。腰旁掛着一枝發亮的手鎗。</p>
<p>「走吧！來遲些兒。天黑了，路上難走呢！」</p>
<p>大家站了起來，背起被子，踏上了蚯蚓般狹窄的田埂。</p>
<p>地窟離開莊子祗半里多路，然而很難走。四面黑沉沉的充滿了恐怖。遠遠的地窟邊的楊樹，在黑暗中跳舞……。</p>
<p>地窟，長廣各的一丈的大洞，上面是荒塚；前面，流過一條淸澈的小河，洞門正對着牠；旁邊，一株大楊樹遮住洞門的入口處。</p>
<p>魚貫地擠進了矮小的　　，大家首先感到的是新發掘的泥土的氣息——霉濕，沉悶，使大家都不的而同地皺了皺眉頭。沒法，在黑暗中摸索着攤開自己的被舖，睡下去……。</p>
<p>這裏，却並不如他們想像中那麽可以睡得安穩。除了孩子，大家都在舖子上反來覆去，傾聽着每點聲音，擔心着一件不幸的發生，以及記　着莊子上的家……就運經歷過苦難的小六也難免不能入睡。</p>
<p>「咳！這生活」！有人在歎氣。</p>
<p>突然——</p>
<p>「砰……砰……砰……」「軋軋軋軋……」</p>
<p>長槍聲聲後緊接着連珠的機槍，那麽近，那麼震蕩，……</p>
<p>「什麽——開火了」？洞裏人全吃一驚，驟然坐起來。</p>
<p>「哇——」小孩從甜夢中驚醒，拉開喉嚨便哭起來。</p>
<p>「別哭」！父親的呼斥聲。</p>
<p>「啊！乖乖，心肝，不哭乖乖，不哭…」母親顫抖地哄騙着。</p>
<p>沒用，孩子哭得那麽響。大家都感到恐怖，責怪着。</p>
<p>「孽障！作死嗎？父親嚴厲忿怒地叱駡着。</p>
<p>在過度緊張恐怖與惶亂下，母親下意識地川身旁的衣服緊緊塞住了哭聲，小孜在她手裏掙扎，不哭，漸漸似乎睡着了。</p>
<p>槍彈已不再在洞上噓噓飛過，沉寂了，大家呼了一口氣。</p>
<p>「啊呀，不……好了，快…快點…火，孩…子被我…悶…死了……」觸着了孩子冰冷的身軀母親驚叫起來。</p>
<p>燭光下，孩子慘白的臉上，還留着淚珠，然而，不動不哭了。</p>
<p>「完了」——絕望而悲愴的父親不禁痛哭起來。</p>
<p>母親幾乎昏厥過去。洞裏是一片混亂，……</p>
<p>「不要賽！喂！聽」！小六直戴地叫着，吹熄了……。</p>
<p>一陣散亂的脚步從遠而近，方向正對着洞，……脚步慢了。</p>
<p>從喘息聲，散亂的脚步，講話聲可以證明這是一大羣剛才打敗的日本兵。他們在漪旁大楊邊坐下休息了。</p>
<p>洞裏人充滿了恐怖，小六眼睛裏却在冒着火。摸摸傢伙：</p>
<p>「媽的！你也會撞到老子手裏！哼！……」但終於沒有扳。道並不是因爲他愛惜自己的生命，而是因爲他想到有二十多個可憐無辜的人，將因他指頭一扳而喪失了生命。</p>
<p>稀微的月光下，日本兵的刺刀在槍頭上發亮。有的在怪聲叫着，有的靜靜地談着古怪不懂的話。然而都是神態狼狽。</p>
<p>呼呼的狂風刮下了黃荳般大的雨點，愈落愈大，日本兵都停止了跳和叫，逃向大樹深密的枝葉處來……。</p>
<p>洞中人愈加恐怖，小六眼睛裏愈噴着火，神經熱烈緊張的激動着，發抖得幾乎把槍扳了……。</p>
<p>然而事實告訴他，確實必須眞的扳了，因爲，在他尖利的目光下，分明有一個黑影發現了洞在吿訴大家……，</p>
<p>「砰——砰……」在日本兵將要走近這洞口來探視時，瘋狂的槍子從洞裏飛了出來，黑影）個個倒下去……，</p>
<p>「軋軋軋軋軋……」幾秒鐘後槍子便如飛蝗般投向洞裏，響聲掩蓋了風雨聲；小六的槍聲；洞中慘厲的叫聲，連到他們自己的咆哮聲……。</p>
<p>十幾秒鐘後，一切聲音全停了，紙剩下暴風雨怒吼。日本兵用刺刀割裂着小六的屍體，恨極地駡他，儘量侮辱他。然而這已經毫無關係。</p>
<p>暴風雨儘在繼續着，水湧進洞裏，和鮮紅的血混成一體二十來個屍體全浮了起來……。</p>

<h3>海燕之戀</h3>
<p>— 江上靑</p>
<p>一個深夜，我在暴風雨中撑着嶙峋的瘦軀，奔還宿舍裏，燈下，我瞧見自己的身體給雨淋濕得像一頭水鴨。</p>
<p>一股不平凡的憶念叩開了我的心扉，我的思想馳向廣漠的遠方：倘使是一隻棲　於海邊的燕子，，將興起一點怎麽的感想呢？</p>
<p>這樣的思想實在是非常的幼稚的，但這樣的事，在今天是很普遍，當一隻懂得珍惜羽毛的孔雀或鸚鵡蜷伏在囚籠中時，却正是一隻海燕冒着風雨歸來的深夜。</p>
<p>至於我，還得用這樣漂亮的故事來說明自己麽？生活過來是顯出那麽七零八落；倘有一點記憶，也是摸索在人間林立憎惡的眼光中爲少數人所喜，多數人所憎。每次當我在風雨中走完最後一段陡　的山程時，我總會用手杖寂寞地敲着山石可可地發響，常他冒着風雨飛同到牠的舊巢時自語着：「又一次風雨過去了」</p>
<p>於是，當我悲嘆着友人鬢邊的衰秃，却從鏡中瞧見自己頭上的白髮；假使我是好記性的話，這樣的事也已够我警惕了。現在我生活在這繁華而感到熱悶的都市中，挨過一日好像一年，心靈雖然倔强，也已顫抖在這人間的風雨中了。這遙遠的一程又一程，正迎面向我襲來。你說，我會畏縮而被市服在這人間的風雨中麼？我是看慣海上的海燕的，我會勇敢地飛向遙遠，衝過這暴風雨的深夜，迎來光明，迎來燦爛的前途。</p>

<h3>「君子之交」</h3>
<p>— 張厚茜</p>
<p>自從我聽到「君子之交」這個名詞以後，就放心的和他接近了。本來末，男女之間就不能有純眞的友誼嗎？</p>
<p>他也曾再三的聲明：他之所以願意和我在一起，純粹是爲了我的樸實，熱誠。他想以他的智慧及學識來美化我，絕不是像一般人的追求。我也一直這麼相信着。</p>
<p>那天他說請我看電影，我便早早的裝束好了等着。穿了件新做的荷花色的旗袍，帶了同色的耳環，自覺還沒有什麼俗氣。</p>
<p>誰知在他打量過我以後，竟甩下帽子。坐在沙發上敎訓起我來，什麼女孩子應該注意內心的美，想以外表取悅於人是不應該的。並且又說：「妳別以爲因爲妳好看，我才認識妳的，吿訴妳，我從來沒有注意渦你的外表。」</p>
<p>我氣得把耳環卸了下來，俯伏在沙發上哭了。</p>
<p>終於，他改變了態度，以兄長的口吻哄我：「也許我的言辭太激烈了一點，但心總是好的。我不是你的「男朋友」，爲什麼老得低聲下氣的順着妳。別哭了，把眼睛哭腫了不「好看」……。」</p>
<p>我問他什麽叫「好看」，他也沒有話說。</p>
<p>總算趕上了那塲電影，我仍是戴着耳環。</p>
<p>我們音樂班上新來了一個非常老實的女孩子，長長的雙辮，厚厚的嘴唇。和她談過幾次話之後，我很喜歡她那淳樸的態度。吿訴了他，叫他到我們班上來看看。</p>
<p>看過之後，他沒有表情。</p>
<p>「叫她也加入我們的君子協定好不好？」</p>
<p>他搖搖頭。</p>
<p>「給你們介紹一下怎麽樣？」又搖了搖頭。</p>
<p>「她不樸實？」他沒有回答。</p>
<p>「不熱誠？」仍舊沒有言語。</p>
<p>「那麽我們三個人做朋友不是蠻好嗎？」</p>
<p>這回他說話了：「何苦叫她夾蘿葡乾兒。」</p>
<p>我說我們又是情人，這話怎講。</p>
<p>他拍拍我的肩說：「你不懂。」</p>
<p>我逼他解釋。</p>
<p>他笑了，設：「我也不懂」。</p>
<p>雖然他只比我大五歲，可是他老把我常小小孩似的，有時哄着我，有時敎訓我，過馬路時還總攙着我。</p>
<p>那天從學校回家，他把我的左手放在他右臂　裏，還不時用左手拍撫着。我頓被同學看見了誤會，他們怎麽會懂得我們是「君子之交」？想把手抽出來，他又不貫，便責問他：</p>
<p>「難道你和別的朋友也是這樣？」</p>
<p>「我只有你這麼一個純眞的　朋友。」</p>
<p>「和你妹妹呢？」</p>
<p>「我沒有妹妹，只有表妹」</p>
<p>我知道他以前和她表妹在一起。走路時倒是常常這樣的。</p>
<p>「可是我和我哥哥走路時不　樣。」我說。</p>
<p>「表哥呢？」</p>
<p>「也不會！」直到我堅決的否定了一切，他才鬆開了手。</p>
<p>我的家已經離開我們不遠了。（却酬）</p>
<h3>一寸山河一寸血　43</h3>
<p>— 葉勁風</p>
<p>這傢伙正在咆哮當口，瞥見整整齊齊的一個輕便武裝行列，的莫十個對子，從客室門外走過，進了上手隔壁一間屋子，雖說客室門上掛着竹帘，從內向外，却是看得淸楚明白。不到兩分鐘，照樣又是一個整齊行列。在客室門外大廳裏，排齊了隊伍，一對一對，走到客室的下手屋子裏。這個塲面，照日本的習用語說起來，大約就是「示威」吧。</p>
<p>再又遲了三五分鐘，又有八名武裝衛士，排着對子走到客室門外，兩面一分，一邊四名，排成雁翅形式；緊接，就見一名當値的値日官，打起竹帘，進入客室，冲着松井等，行了一個軍禮，朗聲說道，，冀察行政署秘書長官兼北平市市長，代表行政委員長接見諸位貴竇」。說畢，立即返身走到門邊。足恭站住。這才有人把門帘揭得高高，聽得大廳裏　，　，　，一陣足音，四名武裝打扮的，托着一大盤一大盤的酒食，進了客室，在大餐桌上舖挑起來，然後退出。剛才門邊那位値日官，隨即邀請來賓入席。正在這個時候，秦德純氏，便裝摺扇，到了室內。</p>
<p>這時大的是午後兩點多鐘，從這時候起，直到五點多鐘快六點了，秦長官一直從容應付，把松井，今井，等等，一片强詞奪理，胡說霸道的許多廢話，駁得體無完膚。最後，這羣無賴，沒有辦法，祗好使出最後一招，好像北平混混，打也打不過，駡也罵不過，只好自己把鼻子拍破，現出無賴原形，張牙舞爪地咆哮着：</p>
<p>「我們不是來與閣下辯論，乃是奉了最高長官的命令，通知貴長官，儘二十四小時以內，把貴屬各種軍隊，從北平，南苑，西苑，宛平，長辛店，門頭溝，還有附近永定河東一帶，一齊退走。這個要求，你接受也得照辦，不接受也得照辦！」說完了，便把帶來的文件，往地下一摔。「這個文件，乃是早早寫就，預備綁架各位軍政長官後，强逼他們簽押的。這時旣然一二兩步陰謀，都未辦到，無人簽字，所以祗好摔在地下了。」</p>
<p>祇見秦畏官，仍舊那麽溫文爾雅地冷笑着說：「中國的軍隊，駐紥在中國的土地上，又不是駐在你們貴國的首都裏，憑了什麽理由，要求我們撤退？」</p>
<p>（這件事情，從首至尾，看得最淸楚的，乃是那位値日官。那位値日官乃是W君的化身，爲了加嚴戒備，臨時客串了一幕。據說當塲還有一個笑話：原來跟着松井同來的幾名隨員，其中就有一位，也不知是先天不足呢，還是後天失調，還是多貪了兩杯好酒和冷飮，因爲台面上爭辯得頗爲激昂，大的不好意思離席，只好把一泡熱尿，尿在自己褲襠裏，也許分量太多，不免就堆流了一大灘。）</p>
<p>這松井一行走了不到半小時，日頭還掛在西山，留着一片夕照，倭軍各方陳綫立即砲聲大作。我在本站，正收發着各方電訊的當口，只聽見東北角，來了整隊飛機的翁翁聲響，不覺有些驚異；因爲根據密報，日方大戰開始，還要等到二十八日拂曉哩。當下便急電總部，總部說「不知道，」又電詢駐平支部，支部說是試探作戰，大隊飛機。係偵察和演習性質。</p>

<h3>美鈔跳　小民叫</h3>
<p>— 少夫</p>
<p>美鈔大跳，兩日來已衝破四千元大關，看他的走勢，似乎五千元外，也不過旦夕之事。</p>
<p>我們每月接到新水單而煩惱的人，聽見這一消息，更覺愁上加愁，凡日常生活所需，必然地會隨之而上漲，日子如何過呢？</p>
<p>已有人在分析美鈔暴漲的原因了，他們說：一因中央銀行已有一個多星期未結出美匯，外貨擁到，進口商大起恐慌，於是都趨黑市扒求現貨：二因謠傳法幣對美鈔官定匯率，即將再度調整。</p>
<p>還有人在說：上面都是表面上的原因，實質的原因在（一）時局動盪不定，（二）當局對經濟無辦法。</p>
<p>我對於經濟問題是外行，不過我認爲上面的無論表面或實質的原因，都不是眞正原因，眞正的原因，一言以蔽之，投機！</p>
<p>比如：第一，中央銀行是等於執行國家金融政策的一個機構，它旣然能隨時拋售黃金調整市價，斷沒有故意不結外匯而讓黑市狂騰的道理：第二，調整匯率的謠傳，官方已鄭重否認了，而且照路透社廿三日電所稱：中國是一個國際貨幣基金的簽字國，匯率調整是受約束的，不能任意變動，「十分之一」是貶値的限度，不到六個月是不能作第二次調整的；第三，從去年勝利後，近一年來，時局都是在動盪不定中，並不是這兩天才如此；第四，經濟無辦法，整個情形確係不好，以表面來說，最近一兩個月物價彼動並不劇烈，政府的發行數字且未增加，不能說經濟情况特別惡劣。基此，我們實在不敢相信這些原因是促使美鈔狂跳的。</p>
<p>右思左想，還是投機者在鬧玄虛！</p>
<p>靑年問題</p>
<h3>美國婚姻問題硏究者　對女子貞操的意見</h3>
<p>— 許盈譯自「雜誌文摘」九月號</p>
<p>美國羅星琪家庭關係硏究所主任及名著「近代婚姻」的作者普本諾博士（Dr．Paul　Popenoc），對未婚靑年貞操問題，曾經詳加硏究，而他的結論是：「貞操仍然是女子之誇，而是婚姻成功的重要因素。我們談貞操問題決不算是腐迂，因爲近代心理學證明貞操是和人類正常天性完全符合的。那末，讓我們聽他道來：</p>
<p>輕視貞操者</p>
<p>有一派人主張女子在婚前無需保存她們的貞操，其原因是：</p>
<p>（一）男女初戀時如果能作進一步的結合，則可增進其情誼，並且使他們更加能够互相瞭解。</p>
<p>（二）性慾的發洩對於心理健康是非常重要的。强自壓抑有害。</p>
<p>（三）婚前的實際結合，能够幫助女子選擇適合的丈夫，而不致於專以感情用事，貽誤終身。</p>
<p>（四）女子於婚前需要性敎育的實踐，然後才能於婚後適應於性生活。</p>
<p>硏究的結果</p>
<p>但是科學上的硏究結果，證明上面的理由是毫無根據，而且是有害的。</p>
<p>（一）經騐吿訴我們，婚前肉體上的結合非特不能增進友誼，而且也許會破壞友誼。男女雙方感情用事而結合渚祗是眞正愛情一部份的表示，其中還缺少了情感的安全感。</p>
<p>（二）壓抑性慾的有害是心理學家佛萊特（Sigmund　Freud）的發現。他以爲：性慾必須發洩，以免人格遭受損害。但是，我們須注意，他另一方面却鄭重聲明；如果靈肉不合一而專門偏於生理上的發洩，則其危險有更甚於性慾的壓抑。</p>
<p>婚前肉體結合的試騐決不能達到靈肉合一的境地。男女雙方的慾望非常有限，祇是貪圖一時的生理上的發洩而已。當時心理上的疑慮和恐怖對雙方都是非常有害的。</p>
<p>（三）從無數的例案上證明，婚前的實際結合並不能幫助一個女子選擇更合宜的丈夫。恰恰相反，她時常會選到更壞的丈夫，或者終身不能選到一個適合的對象。</p>
<p>事實上是這樣：統計吿訴我們，普通男人還是喜歡和處女結婚。或者有些所謂「前進」之流的男人會否認道個意見。但是，我們可以仿傚天方夜談舉行一個試騐：把一對同樣美麗的　生女子擺在一個男人面前，任他選擇一個做他的妻子，然後吿訴他，左面立着的是處女，而右面的則反是。我們以爲男人十個之中必有九個選擇那個處女做他的妻子的。</p>
<p>所謂一個女子滿足了她的生理要求，袪除了感情作用之後，便能更鎭靜地選擇她的丈夫的說法，是完全不合於現實的，大多數女子於婚前所感覺的生理上的衝動實在並不十分嚴重，除非她們平時過慣放蕩不覊的生活或者過分刺激她們自己。但是，一開始性的嘗試之後，則性的衝動將會更爲强烈。有時竟會招致不良的後果。所以，處於此種情形下，婚前失貞對於她們選擇伴侶並不能有所裨助。</p>
<p>不應當放縱</p>
<p>（四）至於婚前所獲得性生活的經騐可爲將來實現美滿婚姻的準備的主張，這也是爲硏究所獲的結果所否認的。羞恥或犯罪的感覺，恐怕被他人發覺的恐懼心。懷孕的恐懼，對於傳染性病的恐懼，以及對其對方的懷疑——所有這些不健全的心理狀態顯然會阻碍一個女子適應她婚後的性生活。</p>
<p>更嚴重的是：「曾經發生過事情」的女孩子最容易養成自卑感，於是她拼命去找對象來「解放」她自己。後來越是失敗，越是狼狽。到那時，便很可能造成精神反常的病症。</p>
<p>即使她找到了對象，她總覺得種種困難，不能適應婚姻生活，因爲她的新對象和從前的男人完全不同，背境上情感上敎育上與前逈異。所以，雙方都不容易調整他們的婚姻關係。這也是男人喜歡和處女結婚的理由之一。</p>
<p>最不幸的是：一旦養成了試騐的習慣後，就不容易改變。所以，許多例案吿訴我們：在婚前已經獲得性的經騐的女人，在婚後最容易犯罪。</p>
<p>硏究所獲的結果終於發現：雙方在婚前都沒有性的經騐者結婚之後最容易獲得美滿的結果，並且能够美滿地適應他們的婚姻生活。</p>
<p>近代的女子們應該審愼地考慮她們的「終身大事」，她們總會認識：婚前的貞操還是値得保守的。即使有人以爲婚前的性關係可能解決一些問題，可是它也可能造成許多嚴重的而不容易解決的新問題。總之，一切是由她們自己作主的。一念之差足成千古之恨，即使在原子時代的女人對於此一問題，大的也需要「三思而後行」罷！</p>

<h3>人話</h3>
<p>— 莫高</p>
<p>假若是人，赤裸裸的也是人；假若不是人，雖穿綢著緞亦不是人！</p>
<p>人是沒有界限，分別的，然而穿上了衣服，就有了職別，等級，貧富之分。</p>
<p>本來人是善良的。然而爲了金錢，名利；</p>
<p>有的人出賣了肉體，</p>
<p>有的人出賣了良心。</p>
<p>看一個人，不能看面貌。</p>
<p>看一個人，不能看衣飾。認識人的錯誤，就因祗是看了人的外表。</p>
<p>活的是人，死去的也是人，只有行屍走肉才不是人！</p>
<p>人可以分三種：一種是自己要活，希望別人也活；一種是自己要活，不希望別人活，還有一種就是自己不要活，叫人家也不要活。</p>
<p>做了人，就要活像一個人！</p>
<h3>一位可敬的人物</h3>
<p>— 陸士雄</p>
<p>前滬江大學事務長兼敎授美人書荷福，八一三戰事　發，即撤退返國。他回美後想念着校內多年的同事們，處身戰區，待遇又很淸苦，生活當很艱難，可是他自己又是心有餘而力不足，後來想來想去，覺得自己所住的房屋太大，所以從三間房間搬到另外的二間，把按月省下來的房錢，匯到上海，託山友人贈與校內同人。隔了幾月，他覺得所匯的錢太少，所以又從二間房間搬到一間，再隔幾時，又從一間大的房問搬到較小的一間，如是者因爲欲想多省些錢下來救助同人，他曾三次遷居，直至小無可小，僅可容身。他說：他能把省下來的錢救的戰難中的朋友，比較住高樓大厦更舒服與愉快得多！</p>
<p>耆君之子，服務於駐　美國空軍，當日本投降前，曾奉命飛滬轟炸，他曾受乃父的諄囑，上海方面有許多是父親的好友，故於投彈時特別審愼，務必看準了軍事目標，纔肯動手。當他飛到楊樹浦滬江大學的上面，他曾盤旋幾次，留戀好久，他說：恨不得降落在滬大的旁邊，去一看校內的究竟，可是那時還由日軍盤據，事實上不能辦到。他把在空中偵察的情形，函　乃父，以釋他老人家對於滬大校舍的關懷。</p>
<p>日軍投降消息傳播後，　君即在美國微募了許多舊的西服革履，裝箱打包，待去年初冬，中美航空復通，便把那些衣履首批裝運來滬，贈與校內的職敎同人，以便他們替換。</p>
<p>數月前凌校長曾接得耆君從美國來信，信內大略說：上海是他的故鄕，滬江大學猶如他的甜密的家庭，他很想回來，曾請求凌校長可否准許他這樣老弱的人回校復職？以娛殘年。否則他也必自動的到上海來，俾與舊友再會面一次，以償他的夙願。</p>
<p>耆君在校服務甚久，滬大校舍的房屋，由他經乎建造的很多，他做事非常認眞，忠實耿介，從前在職時對於稍有不甚適當的用款，他必拒付，所以有「奇老虎」的諧音綽號，同時不免見忌於人，所以曾有人兩次請會計師審査他的帳目，可是出査不一些弊竇，所以不但對他無可奈何，並且反而佩服他確是淸正，現在看到他一種救助舊日同事的偉大同情心，更令人起敬！</p>
<p>上海動態</p>
<h3>沒有用的騎巡隊</h3>
<p>— 雨人</p>
<p>參議會要求裁撤</p>
<p>參議會上，已決議把警察局的騎巡隊予以裁撤，原因是騎巡隊已是落伍了的警政設施，徒然耗費開支，無補實際。雖經宣局長函請「維持原狀」，但議員諸公大都不贊成，從此在馬路上不復見到「馬隊」了。</p>
<p>上海的警察機關設置騎巡隊，始於淸光緒三十三年。當時上海的治安機構是「巡警總局」，分爲四路十九區及騎巡，水巡，消防各隊。嗣後這騎巡隊的設置就一直被採用着。</p>
<p>本市租界的捕房中也早已有「馬巡」的設立。據民國十九年本市「公共租界工部局」年報上載，馬巡共有大馬四匹，小馬三十九匹馬，每匹馬每月的豢養費約三十元左右。馬巡中的巡官由西人担任，巡長巡士，完全由印度人充當。那些印度巡捕，身軀頎長，鬚髮蓬然，高騎馬背，確乎不勝「　然」之概</p>
<p>民國二十二年及二十三年的公共租界馬巡隊中，一共只有西人及印人各一，兩個人也算作一個「馬巡隊」，未免使人莫明其妙。由此也可見「馬巡」的工作情形了。</p>
<p>筆者費了許多時候去查上海警政的資料，想査出一些騎巡隊的「勞績」來，可是抱歉得很，除了參加大出喪和鎭壓或衝散羣衆時，偶而出出風頭外，其他的勞績，却找不到。</p>
<p>說老實話，騎巡隊在從前也是多餘的，中國人總是因循成性，還讓這種落伍的設施遺留在現代化的都市中。如今旣決議將它裁撤，騎巡隊只好「壽終王寢」了，計享壽三十有八。</p>
<h3>說敎</h3>
<p>— ww</p>
<p>由於「和尙請願」和俗人爭意見，我又有幾旬話要吐。信敎自由，是一般的原則，固無分彼此；小時也聽過長輩講佛，心爲之動，大了見「觀世音」影片，心竟大動而特動，曾函懇遠塵指示。法師勸我多爲社會服務，公而忘私，即是信佛。他日（大槪指老邁時期）有緣再行商議。像遠塵的話正合下懷。我佩服他的見地，認識淸楚，於今不可多見。心即是佛，何必在形式上薰得烟霧騰騰？水陸道塲，香燭元　，——何補益於吾心？我認爲大有改革之必要。如基督敎比舊敎已見進步，我們需要快樂，活潑，朝氣，光明，在下就不願踏進烏沉沉的寺宇。我但樂於聽講，我甚至贊成寺宇遷到都市以外去，淸靜而後可以修心。</p>

<h3>關於梁潄溟</h3>

<p>近日紛紛傳說：民主同盟秘書長梁漱溟氏將要辭職。梁氏本人在十八日於首都接見新聞記者時，也當面表示：「辭職乃係預的，並非突然，本人接受職務之先，即的定以三月爲期。」不料梁氏第三天來到上海，和幾位民盟領袖會見之後，乃決定「暫不辭職」了。這之中，我們自不必妄加猜測。</p>
<p>梁氏是一位著名的學者，所作詩文，流利可誦，甚至有人將他的文字比作梁任公的「飲冰室文集」一般爽快淋漓。他著有：「印度哲學概論」，「東西文化及其哲學」，「漱溟三十前文錄」和「漱溟三十後文錄」等數種，其中尤以文錄兩稱在學術上佔有很高的價値。</p>

<p>梁氏在少年時，蓄有短髭，戴一不合時的眼鏡，衣服樸實，不喜修飾，看上去彷彿已有四五十歲光景。放　不覊的態度，恰似學者身份。</p>
<p>詩文自娛　　李氏政治失敗，染氏也就紹光養晦，閉門靜坐，以詩文自娛。其後，曾應「韓靑天」（復榘）聘，前赴山東設立辦理模範村的計劃，因爲韓氏徒有禮賢下士之名，實際學識淺陋，里想頑固，賓主之問，不易相處，梁氏殊感鬱鬱。</p>
<p>抗戰期中，梁氏曾一度出任山東全省黨政委員長，所有全省政務和民衆訓練等事宜，幾乎全由他負責主持，因爲當日的省主席沈鴻烈氏，專理軍事，不惶他顧。</p>
<p>目前，梁氏已經五十四歲，現任民主同盟當務委員兼秘書長，成了政黨的中堅人物。過去他是靑年得志，現在應該改稱一聲：「老當益壯」了</p>

<h3>Chairman Chiang Inspects Construction in Southern Jiangxi; Arrives in Ganxian Yesterday with Wang Lingji and Others; Instructs Party and Youth League Work in Nanchang Before Departure</h3>
<p>[Our Nanchang Dispatch, 24th] Chairman Chiang flew to Ganzhou on the morning of the 24th. When passing through the urban area of Nanchang on the way to the airport, he abandoned his Shanghai-registered "11432" sedan and instead stood in an open-top jeep of the Gendarmerie Regiment. He waved his hat and nodded to the thousands of citizens standing along the road to bid farewell with extreme reluctance, and responded with a smile. From the Provincial Government to the airport, cheers thundered. When the car arrived at the airport, leaders from all walks of life and representatives of the people and elders stood in a solemn formation to greet him. The Chairman got out of the car, shook hands with them one by one, and said thank you. Before reaching the Madame Chiang Kai-shek aircraft, he bid farewell to the well-wishers again and then walked slowly onto the plane. In a moment, the engine started, and the plane slowly rose into the air. The Chairman waved his hand from the window to express his gratitude. Those accompanying him included Jiangxi Chairman Wang Lingji, Chiang Ching-kuo, Yu Chi-shih, Cao Shengfen, Shen Changhuan, and Cai Mengjian, the Director of the Jiangxi Branch of the Executive Yuan's Relief and Rehabilitation Administration. It is reported that the Chairman does not intend to stay in Ganzhou for long and will fly to Guangzhou for inspection.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanchang, 24th] Chairman Chiang is extremely concerned about the construction of Jiangxi. He took a special plane with Jiangxi Chairman Wang Lingji at 10:15 AM on the 24th to fly to Ganxian to inspect the new construction in southern Jiangxi. Chiang Ching-kuo, who had served as the Administrative Commissioner of southern Jiangxi for many years, flew here at 9:05 AM to greet him. Before his departure, the Chairman inspected the Provincial Party Headquarters and the Youth League branch headquarters, and gave some instructions on the work of the Party and the Youth League. He then took a green jeep to the airport, driven by Li, the Commander of the Eighth Gendarmerie Regiment. As they passed through the streets, thousands of people lined the roads to bid farewell. Seeing the Chairman's demeanor, everyone was overjoyed and shouted, "Long live the leader!" When the jeep was about to enter the airport at around 10:00 AM, the Chairman got out of the car. Many people from all walks of life in the provincial capital, including the Party, government, military, elders, and the masses, were already waiting respectfully at the airport. The Chairman walked into the airport, frequently nodding to the well-wishers to express his gratitude. He then shook hands with elders such as Ouyang Wu. At the door of the plane, he waved his hat to say goodbye to the well-wishers again. The special plane took off southward at 10:15 AM and was expected to arrive in Ganxian at around 11:00 AM. It is also reported that the Chairman inspected the Jiangxi Civil Affairs Department yesterday morning and instructed Li Yingchang to work hard and assist Chairman Wang in building a new Jiangxi to make it a model province.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] After smiling and bidding farewell to over a thousand well-wishers from all walks of life in Jiangxi on the morning of the 24th, the Chairman flew to Ganzhou, arriving at Ganzhou Airport at 11:30 AM. The people of Ganzhou were as enthusiastic as those in Nanchang upon hearing of the Chairman's arrival. After resting briefly in Zhongzheng Park, the Chairman walked to Yangming Academy with Chiang Ching-kuo and others at 4:00 PM to pay tribute to the relics of this generation of philosophers. The people surrounded and cheered along the way, and did not disperse for a long time. The Chairman then went to Bajingtai to view the confluence of the Zhang and Gong rivers, admiring it for a long time. He then crossed the river to Hugang to visit the Children's New Village and Zhengqi Middle School. Over a thousand children from the New Village and students from Zhengqi Middle School greeted him with gongs, drums, and firecrackers. The Chairman responded with a smile and often summoned Director Xu Changlin to inquire about the organization of the village and the children's studies. He praised the village's excellent management and good order.</p>
<h3>Chief of General Staff Chen Invites Envoys to Dinner; Gui Yongqing and Pi Zonggan Also Visit; Rumors Say Government Agrees to Consider Resumption of the Three-Man Meeting</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 24th] Political negotiations seem to be awaiting Chairman Chiang's return to Nanjing before making progress on the surface, but there are also some signs that the government seems to have another shift, or is considering the Communist Party's attitude under some kind of tolerance. On the 24th, the only action was that Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Navy Gui Yongqing visited Ambassador Stuart at 5:00 PM. Around 6:00 PM, Pi Zonggan, a military advisor to the National Government, and Rao Baisen, who arrived in Nanjing from Beiping at 2:00 PM, arrived at the American Embassy one after another to visit Ambassador Stuart. At 7:30 PM, Ambassador Stuart accepted the invitation of Chief of General Staff Chen, accompanied by his personal advisor Chuan Jingbo, to attend a dinner. Yu Dawei and Zhang Lisheng also attended. It is widely believed that this kind of movement may be an indication that the government representatives are conducting research on the military three-man meeting before the Chairman returns to Nanjing.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Nanjing, 24th] According to those around Ambassador Stuart Leighton, Pi Zonggan informed Ambassador Stuart this afternoon that Chairman Chiang had responded to the Chinese Communist Party's request and was considering the possibility of convening a three-man group meeting. This is a new concession from the government to avoid the final failure of the current negotiations.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Nanjing, 24th] The Chinese Communist Party stated today that unless Special Envoy Marshall and Ambassador Stuart Leighton obtain a ceasefire guarantee from Chairman Chiang, peace talks will remain stalled. Zhou Enlai is still in Shanghai, waiting for the government or the U.S. side to promise: (1) an immediate ceasefire order, or (2) the convening of a three-man group meeting to discuss a comprehensive ceasefire. Wang Bingnan, a spokesperson for the Chinese Communist Party, stated that Yan'an has abandoned its unconditional ceasefire proposal, saying that the three-man group must decide on the conditions for a ceasefire. Wang also said that Ambassador Stuart and Special Envoy Marshall had promised to "try" to achieve a ceasefire once the Chinese Communist Party joined the political agreement. The Chinese Communist Party wanted to replace the word "try" with "guarantee," saying that based on past experience, promises are not enough and there must be a guarantee.</p>
<h3>Zeng Qi to Arrive in Shanghai at the End of the Month</h3>
<p>Believes Situation Will Not Drag On for Long</p>
<p>[Our Report] Zuo Shunsheng told reporters that Zeng Qi is still in Beiping and will probably arrive in Shanghai around the end of the month. Li Huang should be able to arrive in Shanghai today.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Beiping, 23rd] The Beiping City Party Headquarters held a tea party at the headquarters' auditorium on the afternoon of the 23rd to welcome Youth Party leader Zeng Qi. Zeng attended with Liu Dongyan, a member of the party's Central Committee. After Chairman Wu Zhuren delivered a speech to introduce him, Zeng rose to speak. First, he described his inspection of the Northeast, witnessing the grand scale of the enemy's construction, all of which relied on China's manpower, materials, and financial resources. This further demonstrated China's vast territory and abundant resources. If China could be determined to engage in construction, it would not be difficult to realize Sun Yat-sen's industrial plan and the points listed in Chairman Chiang's "China's Destiny." However, the construction achievements since 1935 have been unsatisfactory. The reason is that China has been plagued by constant wars and political turmoil. The clearing of internal strife depends on a sound and feasible constitution, because once the constitution is established, the country's affairs will have a fixed track to follow. Next, he talked about the Youth Party's ten principles of nationalism, democratic politics, and social policy, and its three characteristics: constructiveness, independence, and comprehensiveness. Therefore, since its establishment 23 years ago, it has not had any shocking actions. However, after more than 20 years, it can still stand independently, which is because the party meets the needs of the objective environment. Zeng finally emphasized that the people of all countries in the world are tired of war, and the Chinese people are particularly eager for governance. Therefore, although the current situation is bleak, it is absolutely impossible for the war to drag on for long. He believes that light will arrive within a year and peace can be achieved. Zeng is scheduled to fly to Nanjing on the 24th.</p>
<h3>Direct Nanjing-Hangzhou Train; Nanjing-Shanghai Jining Train to Be Added</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 24th] The Nanjing-Shanghai Railway Bureau has decided to launch a direct Nanjing-Hangzhou express train on October 1st. It will also add a "Jining" express train between Nanjing and Shanghai, departing from Shanghai every morning and returning to Shanghai on the same day.</p>
<h3>Retrofitting of Lightweight Express Train Successfully Tested on the Beiping-Hankou Railway</h3>
<p>[Our Hankou Dispatch, 24th] The retrofitting of a lightweight express train on the Beiping-Hankou Railway has been successfully tested. It only takes 16 hours from Hankou to Zhengzhou, which is about 10 hours less than an ordinary train.</p>
<h3>Rumors of Abolishing Two Sections of the Ministry of Finance's National Treasury Department</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 24th] There are rumors that the fourth and eighth sections of the Ministry of Finance's National Treasury Department will be abolished, and the number of personnel laid off will reach 58.</p>
<h3>Three Committees of the National Defense Council Hold Meetings for Several Days</h3>
<p>Discussing Payment of Pre-War Deposits in Detail</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 24th] The Economic, Financial, and Legal Committees of the Supreme National Defense Council have been holding meetings since the 23rd. It is reported that they will conduct the most detailed study on the payment of pre-war deposits. The discussions are still ongoing all day on the 24th, and will be submitted to the Supreme National Defense Council for approval after a decision is made.</p>
<h3>Price of Gold Bonds Fluctuates in the Capital</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 24th] The price of gold bonds in Nanjing fluctuated on the 24th due to rumors of the exchange rate being allowed to float for a long time and the rise in Shanghai. The US dollar was purchased at 3,800 and sold at 4,000, an increase of 200 yuan compared to the 23rd. The price of gold ingots remained stable, with the highest price being 240,000, an increase of 6,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Postal Rates to Be Adjusted; Losses Exceed 10 Billion Yuan Last Month</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 24th] According to those familiar with the postal situation, the postal bureau has recently suffered huge losses. Last month, due to adjustments in treatment and other reasons, the total deficit exceeded 10 billion yuan. Although there are government subsidies, it is not a long-term solution. Therefore, increasing postal rates is necessary. However, the adjustment of postal rates is different from the price increase of other public utilities, because postal rates are stipulated by the Postal Law. If there is an adjustment, it must first be approved by the Legislative Yuan or specially approved by the highest standing bureau. The timing is expected to be around November. However, it is also possible to adjust using methods such as increasing surcharges, or adding first and then adding retroactive recognition. As for how much the postal rate will increase after the adjustment, it is currently unknown. However, according to cost calculations, the price of ordinary letters must be increased to 400 yuan or 500 yuan to make up for it. The actual increase in the future may not be so high.</p>
<h3>People of Baxian County, Sichuan, Jointly Celebrate Chairman's Birthday</h3>
<p>Will Present a County Map Carpet</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 24th] In order to congratulate Chairman Chiang on his 60th birthday this year, the people of Baxian County specially ordered a carpet from the China Wool Weaving Factory with a map of Baxian County painted on it to present to the Chairman to commend his achievements and express their gratitude, and as a permanent memorial. The carpet has now been made and is on public display in the Baxian County Council. It will be transported to Chongqing for one day of exhibition before being sent to Nanjing by special commissioner.</p>
<h3>Government to Issue National Assembly Convocation Order on October 2nd</h3>
<p>Election Office Urges All Parties to Submit Lists Quickly</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 24th] The National Assembly Election Office officially issued a notice on the morning of the 24th urging all parties to submit lists. The notice was signed by Zhang Lisheng, as he is the person in charge of the office. The notice requested that all parties submit lists in early October, and the government will officially issue the convocation order for the National Assembly to be held on November 12th on October 2nd. The reporter then interviewed people from various parties separately. The Youth Party said that Zeng Qi has not yet arrived in Nanjing, and there are no other representatives staying in Nanjing.</p>
<p>Liang Shuming of the Democratic League said: How can a meeting be held in such a chaotic situation? The Democratic League will not consider the National Assembly and will formally reply to the government's political consultative conference representatives. Liao Chengzhi, a spokesperson for the Communist Party, said: We will reiterate our past attitude towards the National Assembly. Since the government has failed to cease the war and has not implemented the resolutions of the political consultative conference, the Communist Party will not be bound by this National Assembly.</p>
<p>The reporter saw Central Committee member Chen Guofu at the National Assembly Hall at 5:00 PM, accompanied by Hong Lanyou, Deputy Chairman of the National Assembly Preparatory Committee, and Secretary Ye, inspecting the hall and declaring that the Preparatory Committee's arrangements for the assembly were actively underway.</p>
<p>Also, Lei Zhen, Secretary-General of the Political Consultative Conference, visited Liang Shuming of the Democratic League on the morning of the 24th. They talked extensively. Both Lei and Liang believed that the current situation is becoming clear and that the outcome will be seen soon.</p>
<h3>Government Troops Recover Xinghe County in Eastern Suiyuan; Fu Zuoyi Returns to Suiyuan After Meeting in Beiping</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Beiping, 24th] According to reliable sources, the counties of Taolin, Fengzhen, and Jining in eastern Suiyuan have been successively recovered. Xinghe County (a Communist-occupied area), which is strategically important militarily, was recovered by government troops yesterday and has advanced eastward to reduce the threat to Beiping and Tianjin. Also, Guyuan's second and fourth districts have been recovered and are continuing to expand.</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 24th] Fu Zuoyi suddenly left Beiping by plane at 10:40 AM today. On his way back, he will inspect Datong after the siege is lifted, and may deploy government troops in the western section of the Beiping-Suiyuan Railway in the Datong or Jining area to advance towards Zhangjiakou. It is rumored that after secretly arriving in Beiping last night, he went to the Executive Headquarters at 8:30 PM to attend a military meeting to discuss the clearing of the Beiping-Suiyuan Railway from east and west. It is said that Li Zongren, Sun Lianzhong, Wang Hongshao, Song Kentang, Xu Kangliang, and others attended the meeting.</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 24th] It was rumored in Beiping a few days ago that government troops would march into Zhangjiakou starting today and recover Zhangjiakou by the end of the month. However, as of the time of this dispatch today, there has been no news of battle from the Qinglong Bridge area. It is understood that the participating combat troops have not yet reached their intended areas, so the battle did not begin today. However, it is generally judged that the move into Zhangjiakou will not be delayed for long, because the autumn harvest is approaching in the north, and government troops are eager to end the war before the autumn harvest in order to obtain food. Furthermore, it will snow in the eighth lunar month, and government troops, whose equipment is not very suitable for cold-weather operations, must also achieve a decisive victory before the arrival of winter.</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 24th] A military expert discussed the military geography of Hebei Province, saying: If government troops really move into Zhangyuan as rumored, then western Chahar will be more important than central Chahar. It seems roundabout to enter northern Chahar from Rehe and then advance to Zhangyuan, and the grasslands are not suitable for troop movement and supplies. He continued: If I were the commander defending Zhangyuan, I would make Huailai on the Beiping-Suiyuan Railway the main battleground, because the county seat is located on a mountain. If Huailai is not taken, there will be no problem on the east side of Zhangyuan. However, if I were the commander of the offensive, I would bypass Huailai and reach Xiahuayuan via Yanqing. He did not pay attention to the tense situation in northern Henan and eastern Shandong reported in the newspapers recently, but said that "to catch bandits, first catch the ringleader." The real victory of the war lies in destroying the enemy's main force, and its main force must be in its heart.</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 24th] A spokesperson for a senior agency said that the Communist army recently transported more than 300 wounded soldiers from Duolun in northern Chahar to Zhangyuan, but the spokesperson could not confirm whether there had been fighting in the Duolun area, and said that "under certain conditions, government troops can open up to Zhangjiakou in three routes and be forced to fight back." He also hinted that the government troops in eastern Suiyuan have advanced eastward after relieving the siege of Datong. The spokesperson said that a certain affiliated hospital in Zhangjiakou is the only rear hospital for the Communist army. The recent reports of more than 2,000 wounded soldiers being transported back from Datong and more than 1,700 wounded soldiers being transported back from Jining mostly died due to lack of medicine.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Nanjing, 24th] It is reported that the government forces attacking Zhangjiakou are equipped with new weapons and will use a large number of air forces. It is also reported that Zhu De is responsible for defending Zhangyuan and has made preliminary arrangements to prepare for the government forces' attack, and ordered his troops to maintain their strength in preparation for the final battle.</p>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 24th] A spokesperson for the Ministry of National Defense denied the news from Beiping that government troops had begun to attack Zhangjiakou. The spokesperson told a United Press reporter that the government currently has no such plan, and the Ministry of National Defense has not issued an attack order. He continued that the Ministry of National Defense has not yet received a formal report of the attack from the Beiping Headquarters.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Beiping, 24th] More than 6,000 members of the Communist army's Rehe Headquarters attacked the government troops in Ningcheng on the 21st and were repelled. The Communist army fled back to the Husutaigou area west of the city. The Communist army north of Jianping attacked the government troops near Liujiadian. After the government troops counterattacked, the Communist army suffered heavy casualties and fled to the Blackwater area.</p>
<h3>Government Troops in Jin Occupy Fushan; Communist Troops in Central Hebei Approach the Suburbs of Xiongxian</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Taiyuan, 24th] Government troops occupied Fushan County on the morning of the 23rd.</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 24th] According to a telephone call from Baoding, the government troops advancing towards Xiongxian last night were close to the suburbs of the city and are engaged in fierce fighting.</p>
<p>[Our Tianjin Dispatch, 24th] A major battle is brewing in southern Hebei. The Communist army in the Shijiazhuang area has recently transferred south on a large scale in an attempt to stop the northbound government troops. The railway bridge between Yuanshi and Saiyi has been destroyed by the Communist army. The Communist army's independent regiment in Yuanshi has also been transferred to the Gaoyi area to prepare to destroy the railway. The government troops that have crossed the Zhang River have launched a fierce battle with Liu Bocheng's troops of the Communist army.</p>
<h3>Restoring the Administration of Chahar Province; Organizing Local Armed Forces</h3>
<p>Remarks by Feng Qinzai, Chairman of Chahar Province</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 24th] Feng Qinzai, Chairman of Chahar Province, who has been living in Beiping for a long time, told reporters today that after the administration of Chahar Province is restored, a lenient policy will be adopted towards those who have followed the Communist Party, and the past will not be investigated. The first priority for restoring provincial administration is to organize local armed forces. The performance of county magistrates will be judged based on whether they can completely control the county. The circulation of the Communist Party's border region currency will be temporarily prohibited before specific instructions are received from the central government, so whether there will be sufficient legal tender for the people to use is also a question.</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 24th] Zhang Lisheng, former commander of the Hebei-Chahar-Suiyuan Border Region, has now been transferred to the commander of the Chahar Military Region. Zhang is currently in Beiping assisting Chairman Feng Qinzai in reorganizing the local armed forces in Chahar Province.</p>
<h3>Communist Army in Northeast Expands; Troops Transferred to Harbin</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 24th] The Communist army in the Northeast is actively preparing for war. Recently, more than 20,000 troops have been transferred from Jiamusi, Wuchang, and Lanxi to Harbin. A large number of mountain guns, mortars, and infantry machine guns and artillery shells have been transported from Jiamusi to Harbin to supply the troops in Shuangcheng, Taolaizhao, and other places. Also, the tenth and twelfth brigades of the fourth column of the Communist army in the Lianshanguan and Caohekou area have now been expanded into divisions. The original regiments and battalions under each brigade have been expanded into brigades and regiments, and they are currently intensifying replenishment and training.</p>
<h3>Ma Zhanshan to Go to Nanjing Within the Week</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Beiping, 24th] Ma Zhanshan has been ordered to be transferred to the Deputy Commander of the Northeast Security Headquarters and will go to Nanjing within the week to ask the central authorities for instructions before returning to Beiping and then Shenyang to take up his new post.</p>
<h3>Communist Troops in Northern Jiangsu Dig River Embankments Again; Government Troops Advance to Lianshui; Rumors Say the Communist Party's Border Region Government Will Move to Funing</h3>
<p>[Our Xuzhou Dispatch, 24th] The government troops advancing to Lianghuai are now advancing to Lianshui on the one hand and clearing the remnants of the Communist army in the nearby areas on the other. It is reported that the Communist Party's Jiangsu-Anhui Border Region Government was originally located in Huaiyin and may now move to Funing. Li Yimang, the chairman of the border region government, went to Funing half a month ago. After the failure of the incident, he intends to change his style due to political failure to save the situation. In his "Liberated Area Policy Program," he said that he would abandon class struggle and strive for the people and sympathy. Class struggle is the only political means of the Communist Party, and today its contradictions can be seen to be so extreme.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 24th] The Communist army in northern Jiangsu dug embankments again in various places to prevent the government troops from recovering. It is reported that in Shuyang County, the Dongdi Chaomi River Northdi of the downstream of the Shuxi River and the Fen Shui Sha River were recently dug and destroyed in many places by the Communist army. The affected areas include more than 20 villages and towns, and more than 10,000 hectares of farmland have been submerged. In Donghai County, the banks of the Qiangwei River, from Hezhuang in the south to Dafuting in the north, were also dug and destroyed by the Communist army, and the flooded area reached more than 240 miles. The area at the junction of Shuhai has become a vast ocean, tens of miles wide. The streets of Donghai and Xinpu Town have been surrounded by water, and the Haixin Highway has been cut off by the water. The above-mentioned disaster situation is extremely serious.</p>
<h3>Xue Yue Talks About the Battle Situation</h3>
<p>[Our Xuzhou Dispatch, 24th] General Xue Yue, Director of the Xuzhou Pacification Headquarters, met with our reporter on the evening of the 23rd and talked about the recent battle situation, saying that the main political, economic, and military bases of the Communist army in northern Jiangsu and southern Shandong are Huaiyin, Jining, Heze, and Linyi. Except for Linyi, all have been recovered by government troops. The Communist army's brutal behavior has plunged the people into misery. Since the government troops were forced to fight back, the people have cooperated and things have gone smoothly. The clearing of the situation in northern Jiangsu and southern Shandong is only a matter of time. Talking about the Communist army's strategy and tactics, Xue compared them to mice, because the Communist army has never formally fought against the Japanese army during the war of resistance. The strategy and tactics used are the same as when they were roaming in the past, attacking government troops and driving civilians to charge, resulting in a large number of casualties, which is very lamentable. Xue continued: The Communist Party does not show the national people's desire for stability, and launching a war has lost the hearts of the people. The people in the "Liberated Areas" warmly welcome the government troops and automatically help, which proves that in ancient and modern times, both at home and abroad, those who violate the interests of the whole people will eat their own evil consequences.</p>
<h3>Qiang Jian, Communist Commando Captain, Defects</h3>
<p>[Our Zhenjiang Dispatch, 24th] Official sources said that Qiang Jian, the captain of the forward commando team in the fourth district of the Communist Party's pseudo-Nantong County, recently realized that the Communist Party was disregarding the fate of the nation and destroying peaceful reunification. He defected to our authorities a few days ago and led 126 men, carrying 32 rifles, 62 pistols, and 4 light machine guns. They gathered in the area of Liguan Yintang Henggang in the county to be inspected and reorganized. He was properly taken care of. The Nantong County Government appointed Qiang as the captain of the independent squadron of the Nantong People's Self-Defense Corps and concentrated them for training. Captain Qiang also issued a declaration of defection, resolving to follow the government troops to eliminate the reactionary forces and complete the task of national construction.</p>
<h3>Government Troops in Southern Shandong Recover Jinxiang</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 24th] Government troops recovered Jinxiang County (southwest of Jining) in southern Shandong at noon on the 22nd.</p>
<h3>After Relieving the Siege, A Tour of Datong</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Taiyuan, 24th] This Central News Agency reporter accompanied the慰勞 (comfort) plane to Datong, making us the first guests to land after the siege of Datong was lifted. Since August 16th, when the Datong team of the Military Mediation Department escaped by plane amidst a hail of bullets, the Datong airport has been unusable. Datong was besieged for 45 days, during which the intensity of the battle and the brutality of the Communist army exceeded expectations. Those who did not experience it firsthand would find it difficult to imagine. Outside the North Gate, the station, once a stretch of fine earth, is now covered in bullet marks. The once towering water tower is now nothing more than a cracked tower body and scattered steel bars, a scene for people to mourn. The office of the locomotive section of the station is just a pile of rubble, facing the sign outside the door, lamenting each other's fate. The locomotive factory is a scene of scorched blackness, with brick walls standing forlornly. The locomotives are also covered in scars, their interiors damaged, a sight too terrible to behold. It is estimated that no less than a thousand invading Communist soldiers died under the water tower, according to reliable sources. During this campaign, the Communist army even forced the people to carry yellow explosives, leading them directly to the water tower, and then detonating the explosives from behind, resulting in a horrific scene of flesh and blood flying everywhere, and corpses piled high. Dai Zengjun, Chief of Staff of the Northeast Advance Army, told reporters, "I have been in the military for 26 years and have fought hundreds of battles, but I have never experienced such intense fighting." The Yusha Iron Bridge northeast of the city was also bombed in two places. The wooden bridge on the highway there is the key to the Datong-Yanggao road, and since the farmland is all east of the river, it is also the lifeline of the Datong citizens. This bridge was built by the Japanese in the 29th year of the Republic of China (1940), taking two years to complete. All the materials were shipped from Jilin. This time, the Communist army actually set fire to and destroyed more than 30 of its spans. Shaling is the only high ground southeast of the city, commanding a view of the airport. The Communist army desperately fought for it, but failed repeatedly. It is said that in the northeast bunker of Shaling alone, the Communist army paid the price of three thousand lives. The police school three miles west of the city still has stone walls, but the interior is completely burned down. Bloodstains can be seen in the sorghum fields near the obstacles, forming a straight line. According to Jiao Kejing, the commander of the 11th Security Regiment responsible for defending the area, the Communist army's 2nd Independent Regiment had only a little over two hundred men left after charging twice. When reporters inspected the bloodstains in the sorghum field, they found a Communist army diary. It was judged to be a platoon leader's diary, which read: "I had two dreams last night. In one dream, my father died, and in the other dream, the enemy (referring to the Nationalist army) was very fierce, and our (referring to the Communist army) ranks could not be assembled. Please make my dreams come true, I am still very afraid in my heart! I wonder why we have to fight a civil war?" The extreme opposition to internal strife among its lower-level cadres is evident here. According to Commander Dong, the Communist army repeatedly released sneezing gas, and many soldiers and civilians were poisoned. We captured several toxic bombs. (It is reported that the Communist army released poison gas in several places, including the police school, Beiyue Temple, and the railway station.) The Communist army's denial of using poison gas is self-defeating. During the siege of Datong, the city was in good order. In the evening, military and political cadres and students divided into sections for security and census. The Jin Opera House performed on time to comfort the wounded soldiers. This was a relaxing interlude in a tense situation. General Chu Xichun, commander of the Nationalist army, told reporters: In this war, the Communist army launched a fierce attack for more than a month with ten times the strength, but we finally won. The main reason was "harmony among the people." He also said that after the siege was lifted, emergency relief would be the first step, followed by rescuing the people of Yanbei. Today, the refugees in Datong who have no homes urgently need relief. The drought in the area has been long-standing, and the autumn harvest will be at most only 30%. Now, further ravaged by the war, the losses are even more severe. On the way back and forth over northern Shanxi, the reporter looked down at the once beautiful mountains and rivers between Datong and Taiyuan. Now, the shadows of the counties of Huairen and Dai County, which have been reduced to hell, evoke endless sighs. The railway tracks between Shuoxian County have all been destroyed, but Yingxian County, an ancient city still defended by the Nationalist army, stands majestically. Inside the city, the Yanbei Plain stretches as far as the eye can see, but old scars and new wounds are everywhere. This scene of the frontier evokes infinite sighs in the hearts of the reporter and others on the plane.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Gui Sui, 24th] The Battle of Jining was even fiercer than the Battle of Sipingjie. Over twenty thousand bodies were collected and buried after being found lying on the streets inside and outside the city. Today, when the people mention the Communist army, they cry out in pain. The electric light company has been completely destroyed by the Communist army, and the boilers and important machines have been taken away. The railway station outside the city was also severely damaged. The people suffered even more looting when the Communist army was defeated and collapsed.</p>

<h3>Developing Northeast Industry and Mining: The Resources Committee Announces the Establishment of Fifteen Institutions; Technical Personnel to Be Trained Locally in New Schools</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Beiping, 24th] Qian Changzhao, chairman of the Resources Committee, recently inspected factories and mines in Jinxi, Huludao, Jinzhou, Beipiao, Fuxin, Shenyang, Fushun, Liaoyang, Anshan, Yingkou, Benxi, Xi'an, Changchun, Jilin, and other places. He held detailed discussions with relevant parties and believes that although the heavy industry in the Northeast has been destroyed, if the existing foundations are properly utilized, there is still much that can be done. In the past, the Japanese operated heavy industry in the Northeast for the purpose of preparing for war and coordinating with military operations, and their plans were often unreasonable. Moreover, they were eager to increase production and neglected some basic work, which affected the resource base. Now that the Northeast has returned to the embrace of the motherland, this shortcoming urgently needs to be adjusted and improved. However, the situation in the Northeast has not yet been fully stabilized, and although many enterprises should be handled by the Resources Committee, it is actually impossible to fully implement them. The most pressing need at present is for senior and mid-level technical personnel. The Resources Committee plans to discuss with the education authorities to establish specialized schools for local training. Currently, based on social needs and in coordination with the overall national economy, the following units will be established starting October 1st of this year among the major enterprises that should be handled by the Resources Committee:</p>
<p>List of Responsible Persons for Each Institution</p>
<p>(1) Northeast Electric Power Bureau: Director Guo Kedi, Deputy Directors Chang Ji, Gui Jiu-huang. (2) Fushun Mining Bureau: Director Cheng Zongyang, Deputy Directors Xie Zizhen, Guo Zhong. (3) Fuxin Coal Mining Company: General Manager Guo Xiangyu, Assistant Managers Zhang Boping, Lou Lianghai. (4) Beipiao Coal Mining Company: General Manager Lei Baohua, Assistant Managers Wu Zhitian, Zou Qipan. (5) Xi'an Coal Mining Company: Assistant Manager Pan Jiwu (acting General Manager). (6) Anshan Iron and Steel Company: General Manager Shao Yizhou, Assistant Manager Jin Shuliang. (7) Benxi Coal Mining Company: General Manager Zhang Songling. (8) Northeast Metal Mining Company: General Manager Shi Jiafu, Assistant Manager Pan Zhijia. (9) Liaoning Cement Company: General Manager Yu Guocheng, Assistant Manager Qi Wei. (10) Liaoning Pulp and Paper Company: General Manager Zhao Xuyong, Assistant Managers Ding Sixian, Cao Liqing. (11) Shenyang Chemical Plant: Plant Director Zhang Kezhong, Deputy Plant Director Cai Xianyuan. (12) Shenyang Rubber Factory: Plant Director Ruan Jueshi. (13) Huludao Sulfuric Acid Plant: Plant Director Yao Wenlin (concurrent). (14) Shenyang Locomotive and Rolling Stock Manufacturing Company: General Manager Liu Jiji. (15) Preparatory Office of Shenyang Machinery Factory: Director Sun Wenzao, Deputy Directors Zeng Guangtao, Wei Huaye. In addition, there are several enterprises that can be merged with similar enterprises in the Guannei region of the Resources Committee or four additional affiliated units can be established: the Northeast Refinery of the China Petroleum Corporation (Plant Director not announced), the Jinxi Plant of the North China Cement Company (Plant Director Lu Zongxian, concurrent), the Shenyang Rolling Stock Factory of the Central Machinery Corporation (Plant Director Li Xiangzhou), and the Shenyang Branch of the Central Electrical Equipment Factory (Plant Director Tang Mingqi). The work plans, organization, and budgets of the aforementioned units have been separately approved and deadlines have been set for implementation, with the aim of gradually modernizing and mechanizing them. Furthermore, the Northeast Office of the Resources Committee has now been established, with Xie Shuying as Director and Sun Wei'e as Director of the Jilin-Changchun Branch Office.</p>
<h3>An Audit Team in Guangzhou Discovers a Muddled Accounting Mess; Military and Political Department Commissioner Mo Yushuo Placed Under Surveillance</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Guangzhou, 24th] The Guangdong-Guangxi Region Audit Team has discovered multiple instances of muddled accounting in recent days, with the most severe cases found in those entities that were taken over by the Military and Political Department Commissioner's Office. The team recently discovered in the Huangsha Treasury that there were 177 boxes of opium at the time when the 50th Division of the New First Army was stationed there. Four boxes went missing from the treasury. When the division departed, it handed over 173 boxes to the Military and Political Department Commissioner's Office. Subsequently, there was collusion between the superiors and subordinates to sell off the entire stock. When the Commissioner's Office transferred the treasury to the Third Supply Zone of the Logistics Department, this item was no longer listed in the inventory. Ao Jingliang and Ao Xiang, who were responsible for managing the warehouse, have absconded for fear of punishment and are currently being secretly pursued. Because a disbursement order was stamped with the private seal of Mo Yushuo, the Military and Political Department Commissioner, Mo is also suspected. The Audit Team has already sent a telegram to President Song, requesting the Ministry of National Defense to thoroughly investigate and severely punish the matter. Mo Yushuo arrived here on the 23rd. Director Wang Heng of the Provisional Headquarters, accompanied by the commander of the 16th Gendarmerie Regiment, waited at the airport with five gendarmerie soldiers. Mo arrived from Shanghai with Zhao, the deputy of the First Gendarmerie Platoon, and an aide-de-camp. He appeared gaunt. After disembarking, he was placed under the surveillance of Commander Zhou. At the same time, two of Mo's confidants who were waiting at the airport were not allowed to approach or speak to him. Mo is currently being held at the Gendarmerie Headquarters, awaiting investigation and processing.</p>
<p>A Sudden Fire in the Warehouse—Something Fishy?</p>
<p>Two days before Mo's arrival, a warehouse in Henan here suddenly caught fire around 10:00 PM on the 21st, and was not completely extinguished until 1:00 PM the next day. The warehouse was taken over by the Third Supply Zone from the Military and Political Department Commissioner's Office, and contained a mountain of supplies, including countless amounts of grain and clothing. The warehouse had been sealed for a year and there had been no anomalies, so the sudden fire during the audit is causing much consternation. According to those involved, the fire was caused by a guard carelessly discarding a cigarette butt that night. The Audit Team is currently investigating. The number of losses is currently difficult to estimate.</p>
<p>According to Zou Yi, the Guangzhou Region Commissioner of the Navy Department, the number of enemy and puppet ships and supplies taken over from the Japanese was very large. However, the existing stock and the estimated numbers are vastly different. It is possible that some criminals have concealed the assets or sold them for personal gain. In addition to grasping the current situation and providing information for the Audit Team's reference, the public is being encouraged to report any leads.</p>
<h3>Metal Bricks Discovered in Guangzhou; Rumored to Be Traitor Assets; To Be Publicly Assayed</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Guangzhou, 23rd] The Guangdong-Guangxi Region Audit Team and the Guangdong-Guangxi-Fujian Enemy Assets Disposal Bureau jointly unearthed seventy metal bricks on the 23rd in the Lele Firm in the Tenth Fu District (a traitor's property). Each brick weighs approximately fifty catties. They have been jointly sealed and handed over to the Central Bank for safekeeping and will be publicly assayed on a scheduled date.</p>
<h3>Beef Cans Turn Into Stones</h3>
<p>A Riddle Among Relief Supplies in Jiangxi</p>
<p>[This Newspaper, Nanchang Correspondent] When the Jiangxi Rehabilitation and Relief Branch of the Executive Yuan distributed relief supplies such as canned milk and beef, the agencies receiving these supplies discovered that the wooden boxes containing the cans were filled with cans on top and stones on the bottom. Whether these stones were shipped across the ocean by the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration or whether there was corruption within the distributing agencies is the subject of much speculation.</p>
<h3>Yi Ao, Head of the Hunan-Hubei-Jiangxi Audit Team, Overwhelmed by Grief; Says the Character of the Personnel Involved in the Takeover is Fundamentally Flawed</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Hankou, 24th] Qiu Ao, head of the Hunan-Hubei-Jiangxi Audit Team, has left Hunan and is expected to arrive in Hankou tonight. According to sources from Changsha, Qiu Ao made a statement before leaving Hunan, saying that what distinguishes the audit work in Hunan from other places is the endless stream of escapes. In some cases, the stolen goods are present, but the people have fled far away; in other cases, the people have not left, but the goods have disappeared. To reduce the difficulty of the work, he rarely published the progress of the audit during his month-long stay in Hunan. Now that the audit has come to an end, most of the cases have been transferred to the court for investigation, and a few unfinished matters have also been entrusted to the provincial and municipal councils for continued settlement. He plans to submit a general report after returning to Hankou, so there is no need to elaborate further. However, there are some things he still feels compelled to say: After handling this audit work, he deeply feels the lack of national concept and moral values among the general takeover personnel, which is truly heartbreaking. For example, when the enemy withdrew from Yueyang, the local electrical equipment was still complete and intact, but the takeover personnel had the heart to dismantle and sell various equipment piecemeal to enrich their own pockets, resulting in the current situation in Yueyang, which has returned to the primitive era. In this regard, if a person's character is fundamentally flawed, it is no exaggeration to say that they are no different from beasts. Furthermore, the Hankou District Court has been investigating the case of corruption in the auction of materials from the Jianghan Customs for days, and Chen, the tax affairs officer, and three inspectors are under suspicion.</p>
<h3>The Northeast Region Audit Team Concludes Its Work</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Shenyang, 23rd] The Northeast Region Audit Team is currently concluding its work.

<h3>Personnel Arrive in Chengdu to Aid in the Search for Missing American Pilots, Set to Depart for Xichang</h3>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 24th] The American military authorities are actively trying to rescue five American pilots of a B-29 aircraft who went missing in the Sichuan-West Yi (Lolo) region two years ago.

<h3>Lake Bandits Surrender with Weapons; Liao Bingnan's Troops Waiting for Registration Near Xukou</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Suzhou, 24th] The bandit Xie Desheng's troops, who used to roam between the Dongshan East Cape in Suzhou and the Heng Jing area in Wujiang, consisting of seventy to eighty people, with two light machine guns and forty to fifty short guns, have all surrendered to the First Pacification District Headquarters. Hu Zhongying, a bandit who roamed in Yixing, has also led his troops of fifty to sixty people, carrying weapons, to surrender upon hearing the news. In addition, the Taihu bandit Liao Bingnan's troops have now gathered in the Three Mountains near Xukou Town, waiting for registration, with over a hundred people, three light machine guns, eight short guns, and forty rifles. It is reported that there are still forty or so people with more than twenty short guns who have lost contact. The First Pacification District Headquarters is currently trying to continue to appease them.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper, Suzhou, 24th] The Capital Garrison Headquarters, in view of the fact that the bandit suppression work in Jiangnan has been divided into districts and launched separately, and that the government has decided to be lenient towards the bandits and give them a chance to start anew as much as possible, should fully convey this goodwill. Therefore, it has formulated a pacification work propaganda plan, ordering each district to organize pacification propaganda teams to go deep into the people to promote the message. Currently, the four counties of Wuxian, Taicang, Kunshan, and Changshu in the Yangcheng District have begun this organization, acting as the vanguard of the bandit suppression troops.</p>

<h3>Yesterday the Capital High Court Interrogated Zhou Fohai and Others All Day</h3>

<h3>Girl Scout Yang Huimin</h3>
<p>Once Presented the Flag to the Isolated Battalion at Sihang Warehouse; Detained on Suspicion of Colluding with the Enemy</p>
<p>[Shen Shi News Agency, Nanjing, 24th] Yang Huimin, the girl scout who gained fame for presenting the flag to the isolated battalion at Sihang Warehouse, is being held in the women's detention center of the Military Police Headquarters on suspicion of colluding with the enemy during the War of Resistance. Yesterday, the Military Law Department of the Ministry of National Defense held a hearing to investigate. Once the evidence is confirmed, a public prosecution will be initiated. Yang is now nearly thirty years old, with her hair in braids, wearing a red plaid single-layer cheongsam and a short black velvet jacket.

<h3>Public and Education Staff in Nanjing and Shanghai to Receive Subsidized Cloth and Coal</h3>
<p>Implementation Possible Within November</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 24th] News of subsidized cloth and coal for public and education personnel has been confirmed by relevant parties, but implementation may occur within November due to time-consuming preparations. It is reported that the current preparatory work includes two items: (1) A detailed investigation into the exact number of dependents of public and education personnel in Nanjing and Shanghai; (2) Separate orders to the China Textile Industries Corporation and the Fuel Administration to submit the minimum cost of cloth and coal for distribution, which will serve as the basis for determining future designated distribution prices. The distribution volume in the Nanjing and Shanghai areas is enormous, and the quality of cloth also needs to be uniform, so this undertaking still requires considerable time in terms of technology.</p>
<h3>Vitamin B</h3>
<p>Can Cure Male Infertility</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 24th] China Natural Science Society News: Dr. Biskin of the University of California Medical School recently published a report stating that Vitamin B (i.e., vitamin) can treat male infertility. Both male and female hormones exist in the male body, but both can be destroyed by the liver. This destruction requires the help of Vitamin B, so a lack of Vitamin B prevents the liver from destroying female hormones in the body, causing male infertility. Taking Vitamin B can cure it.</p>

<h3>Editorial: The Inside Story of the Anti-American Diplomatic Offensive</h3>
<p>Soviet Representative Gromyko spoke at the United Nations Security Council the day before yesterday, urging attention to the situation in China and explaining his reasons. The main points were three: (1) The continued presence of American troops in China has created a situation that could lead to international friction; (2) American troops are currently interfering in the internal affairs of China, Iceland, and Latin American countries; (3) The situation in China is not solely related to the United States and China.</p>
<p>We are not surprised by these remarks from Representative Gromyko. In his speech, it was the same old tune, and no new elements were found. Some time ago, the Moscow radio station broadcast anti-American rhetoric, and Soviet newspapers published articles criticizing American interference in the Chinese civil war. We have long been accustomed to hearing and seeing these. The Chinese Communists, acting in concert, have also repeatedly performed the set of anti-American propaganda offensives they learned from their "teacher" in China. We are tired of hearing and seeing it. Therefore, Representative Gromyko's remarks are not worthy of attention. However, at this moment, some American friends, incited by leftist elements, and some politicians in China incited by the Chinese Communists, are simultaneously performing "American Withdrawal from China Week," as if they had agreed to be cheerleaders for Gromyko, making this performance a little too obvious.</p>
<p>Gromyko's intention in making such remarks is nothing more than to launch a diplomatic offensive against the United States. Because the Soviet representative failed repeatedly at the Paris Peace Conference and was unable to exert its power to control the conference, it seized the opportunity to exploit the border conflict between Greece and Albania and launch a large-scale attack on the British troops stationed in Greece. However, when it came to the Security Council, it failed to expand its diplomatic offensive, so it changed direction and attempted to launch an offensive against the United States by exploiting the China issue, to restore the Soviet Union's international prestige. At the same time, the Wallace incident in the United States, which was triggered by Wallace's advocacy of appeasement toward the Soviet Union, caused a political uproar, resulting in Wallace's resignation, making the Soviet Union even more suspicious that the US government had a tendency toward the "two worlds." Therefore, it created "American Withdrawal from China Week" on the one hand, and adopted preemptive measures in diplomacy on the other, intending to throw a bomb into American public opinion, to stir up domestic debate in the United States, forcing President Truman to be wary. But in our view, no matter what external opinions are, the diplomatic policy of the United States is so upright that there is no gap to exploit, and there is no reason for it to be shaken.</p>
<p>President Truman issued a declaration on China policy last December, with three main points: (1) The United States recognizes the National Government as the sole legitimate government of China; (2) The United States hopes that China will become a strong, united, and democratic country; (3) The United States does not interfere in China's internal affairs. So far, the United States has not changed. As for the continued presence of American troops in China, it is at the request of the National Government to assist China in repatriating enemy aliens and prisoners of war and to establish peace and order within China, a task that has unfortunately not been completed due to the obstruction of the Communist Party. Therefore, to have American troops withdraw from China, there is no need to ask the United States; it is only necessary for the Communist Party to cease obstructing China's recovery and unification to achieve the goal. The Soviet representative said that the American troops in China have already created a situation sufficient to cause international friction. What is the basis for this claim?</p>
<p>China is also a permanent member of the Security Council. The China issue can only be resolved by itself. Even if it is to be brought before the Security Council, our own representative can submit it, so why is it necessary for Soviet representative Gromyko to overstep his authority? Gromyko considers himself to be speaking out for justice, but we do not understand how Gromyko's "justice" should be interpreted. We go a step further and say that even if we admit that Gromyko's speech is entirely out of good intentions, where does Gromyko's overstepping of authority place China? And some Chinese politicians who follow Gromyko and shout that the China issue should be resolved by the UN Security Council are all a complete expression of servile mentality.</p>
<p>China and the Soviet Union are both major powers in the Far East and should cooperate to maintain lasting peace in the Far East. China received spiritual and material assistance from the Soviet Union during the War of Resistance, and we still remember it to this day. Since the signing of the Sino-Soviet Alliance Treaty, our country's diplomacy with the Soviet Union has been based on the treaty. But on the Soviet side, although the foreign ministers of the three countries agreed at the meeting last December not to interfere in China's internal affairs, has the Soviet government truly implemented its commitment to promoting friendly relations between China and the Soviet Union? This July, Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov actually opposed China's invitation to the Paris Peace Conference, and now Gromyko is overstepping his authority, treating our country as inferior to Albania. We do not know why the Soviet Union wants to insult its ally China to such an extent!</p>
<p>The diplomatic policy adopted by China, as repeatedly stated by Minister Wang Shijie, is entirely based on international cooperation to jointly maintain world peace as the highest guiding principle. Therefore, it consistently adopts an impartial and neutral attitude in all international conferences. As for the issue of negotiations between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, it is an internal affair of our country and has nothing to do with the Soviet Union. The Soviet representative suddenly overstepping his authority and bringing China's internal affairs before the Security Council is deeply regrettable. The National Government should immediately express its opposition and protest. And we hope that a group of people who have forgotten their national position and are shouting "American troops out of China" will one day deeply regret it!</p>
<h3>Adjournment of the Shanghai Municipal Assembly</h3>
<p>The First Shanghai Municipal Assembly was held for two weeks and two days, and adjourned yesterday afternoon, issuing a declaration. During the sixteen-day session, news of the Assembly filled the city's newspapers. The events questioned by the Assembly and the motions discussed attracted the attention of the entire city. Even various industries and businesses often formed delegations to petition the Assembly. This shows that Shanghai citizens really need an organization that represents public opinion. And the achievements of this Municipal Assembly, from a calm and rational perspective, can be generally considered not too far from our expectations.</p>
<p>Of course, after eight years of wartime occupation, Shanghai is dilapidated and has suffered from the soaring prices of the past year since victory. Industry and commerce have long been outwardly strong but inwardly weak, with only a superficial shell remaining. People's livelihoods are declining, and the people's capacity is exhausted. In terms of municipal finances, it is already unbearable. However, because Shanghai has a hundred things to be done after the war, if we want it to gradually recover and maintain its status as a first-class international city, municipal construction cannot be delayed. The original budget for the second half of the year for the Municipal Government was over 84.7 billion yuan, with a deficit of over 33.3 billion yuan. Now, under the general principles of increasing revenue, reducing expenditure, and emphasizing construction while eliminating redundant personnel, the Municipal Assembly has reduced it to a little over 75.5 billion yuan, and the deficit has also been reduced to a little over 22.2 billion yuan. In a situation where no other methods could be found, the Municipal Government was allowed to levy municipal construction donations and surcharges on public utilities to make up for the shortfall. On the one hand, the Assembly showed concern for the people's capacity, and on the other hand, it could not bear to see Shanghai's municipal administration fall into a state of stagnation. It resolutely took responsibility and solved this difficult problem for the administrative authorities and the citizens of the city. It cannot be denied that it has the proper style of a local parliament in a democratic country. The essence of democratic politics lies in taking responsibility. Criticism must be responsible, and resolutions must be responsible. If the people's representatives only know how to sing high-sounding tunes and make indiscriminate criticisms, while avoiding responsibility where it should be borne, then nothing will ever be resolved. What construction can be discussed?</p>
<p>Secondly, when we see that the Municipal Assembly has made fairly reasonable resolutions or suggestions on several major issues, we especially feel that Shanghai citizens really have their representatives speaking for them. For example: (1) In terms of education, it advocates that expenses should account for 20% of the total expenditure, and that educational decorations must be abolished, focusing on national education to solve the problem of children out of school; requiring strict examination of the tuition fees and their use by private schools, and requiring that the tuition standards for the next semester must be approved by the Municipal Assembly; (2) In terms of industry, commerce, and finance, it accepts the appeals of the industry and commerce circles, and will send representatives to the central government to make sincere petitions to save the collapse of the Shanghai market; (3) In terms of construction in various departments such as public works, public utilities, sanitation, and police, it makes every effort to support all construction plans that should be carried out, and stipulates the required expenses, but does not allow them to be consumed in "supporting people"; (4) In terms of people's daily life, it urges the government to make efforts to curb the rising prices, suggests that the central government formulate regulations on housing rentals based on social customs, calls on the government to abolish unnecessary fuel control measures as soon as possible, and change to encouraging people to transport coal to Shanghai to prevent coal shortages in winter; At the same time, it instructed the Municipal Government to negotiate the recovery of the racecourse land and develop it into parks and sports venues, and asked the Central Government to interpret whether horse racing is gambling, etc., which can be seen to be close to the opinions of the real people.</p>
<p>Now, the first conference of the Municipal Assembly has adjourned. In three months, we will see its second conference convened. We deeply hope that in these three months, the Municipal Government will respect the resolutions of this Municipal Assembly and implement them one by one; especially hope that the various specialized committees of the Municipal Assembly can closely contact the relevant bureaus of the Municipal Government on weekdays and regularly review their work. Then, when the second conference is convened in the future, the criticism and resolutions of the public opinion organs on the administrative affairs of the Municipal Government will be more practical and effective.</p>

<h3>Stalin's Remarks Clearly Indicate that There is No Danger of War at Present; Claims that Cooperation with Western Countries Is Possible; Believes that Rapid Withdrawal of American Troops from China Is Necessary for Maintaining Peace</h3>
<p>[France News Agency, London, 24th] Head of State Stalin today met with the Moscow correspondent of the "Sunday Times" and delivered a speech, which was broadcast by British radio. The newspaper reporter asked Stalin whether he believed that the rapid withdrawal of American troops from China was necessary to maintain peace? Stalin replied: "Indeed, that is my opinion." The reporter asked Stalin whether he believed that the United Kingdom and the United States are surrounding the Soviet Union with a capitalist iron ring? Stalin replied: "There is no danger of war at present. If these countries want to do this (I cannot be sure), they will certainly not succeed." When the reporter asked about the German issue, Stalin replied: "I don't think it is a problem that the Soviet Union is using Germany to oppose Western Europe and the United States." Stalin said when discussing the Potsdam Agreement and the Anglo-Soviet Treaty: "The Soviet Union's policy in Germany is only to ensure the safest guarantee of a solid and lasting peace." The reporter then asked: Does the atomic bomb threaten peace? Stalin said: "The atomic bomb is not enough to determine war. Monopolizing the atomic bomb is enough to endanger peace, but there are some facts and methods to eliminate this danger. The so-called fact is that the monopoly cannot last, and the so-called method is to prohibit the use of atomic bombs."</p>
<p>[Associated Press, London, 24th] Stalin made remarks in Moscow today, expressing his belief that peaceful cooperation between the Soviet Union and Western democracies "has not only not diminished, but will grow even more." He also denounced accusations that Moscow influences the policies of communist parties in Western Europe as "absurd and borrowed from the bankrupt Hitler and Goebbels arsenal." He also said that he has "firm faith" in Anglo-Soviet friendly relations.</p>
<h3>British Side Is Carefully Studying the Views of Soviet Leaders</h3>
<p>[Our News] London, 24th Broadcast: A senior official in London today made an informal statement saying that Stalin's statement that "there will be no new war" is clearly telling Western countries that the Soviet Union will also respond to the strong attitude of the United States with a strong attitude. A diplomatic spokesman said that the views of Soviet leaders are being closely studied by all parties, but how the government will respond cannot be predicted at this time, and said that Stalin's reply was "firm and friendly." Stalin's claim that the ruling circles of the United Kingdom and the United States want to implement a next-capitalist encirclement of the Soviet Union is also impossible, which is clearly a warning and opinion that the United States should withdraw its troops from China as soon as possible. One of the most important points is that Stalin believes that the atomic bomb is only enough to intimidate "neurotic people" and is not enough to become a decisive factor in future wars. In addition, Stalin also hinted that the Soviet Union will soon have atomic bombs as well.</p>
<h3>Soviet Union Proposes to the Security Council that American Troops in China Should Withdraw; Claims that This Move Is Easy to Cause International Friction; Our Representative Opposes Interference by the Security Council</h3>
<p>[Our News] Washington, 24th Broadcast: Lake Success, New York News: Xie, the Chinese representative to the United Nations Security Council, protested against Soviet representative Gromyko's statement in the Security Council that the presence of American troops in China is sufficient to threaten world peace. He said that the country opposes the Security Council considering the Soviet proposal, because the current situation in China does not require the Security Council to interfere.</p>
<p>[United Press, Lake Success, New York, 23rd] The Soviet Union today raised the issue of the situation in China to the United Nations Security Council, urging it to pay attention. Soviet representative Gromyko accused the US Marines of staying in China, which may cause international friction; Gromyko said that the US cars are interfering in the internal affairs of China, Iceland and Latin America, and said that after the failure of Japan and Germany, the stationing of foreign troops in non-enemy countries can no longer be considered out of war necessity. He cited appeals from a group of famous Chinese figures, urging the United States to stop interfering in China's internal affairs, and said that the resulting situation in China is not only related to the United States and China. Gromyko's statement is the first formal action by the Soviet Union to attack the United States' China policy. Moscow newspapers had previously attacked this policy of the United States several times, and political observers had long been convinced that the sudden unease in the country would eventually be brought up in the Security Council. This action by the Soviet Union occurred after the failure of the political war against Greece. Observers believe that if the Soviet Union insists on not giving in on the China issue, Gromyko will be in a stronger position, because a large part of the left-wing opinion in the United States opposes the so-called unilateral assistance of the United States to the Chinese National Government to oppose the Communist Party.</p>
<p>[France News Agency, New York, 23rd] The Soviet Union proposed to the Security Council that all member states of the United Nations report on the situation of their troops stationed overseas, and the Security Council will discuss it soon. It is heard that in order to preempt the situation, the United States will notify the Security Council that American troops are withdrawing from China, Iceland, and other foreign countries in accordance with international agreements. According to what Soviet representative Gromyko said, the overseas deployment of American troops constitutes a threat to world peace and security. US representative Johnson will refute this and list the facts to prove that US troops are withdrawing in accordance with the planned plan.</p>

<h3>Wallace Expresses Agreement with Stalin's and Eden's Remarks</h3>
<p>Said to Give the World New Hope for Peace</p>
<p>[Our News] San Francisco, 24th Broadcast: Former US Secretary of Commerce Wallace said today: "The recent remarks by Stalin and Eden have given new hope for peace to the millions of people who seek peace."</p>
<h3>Suggestion to Organize Federation in British-Occupied Area of Germany</h3>
<p>[Our News] Paris, 24th Broadcast Berlin News: Regarding the division of the British-occupied areas of Germany into federations, the German Issues Research Committee recently submitted two proposals to the British Control Committee: (1) Five regions of considerable importance: including northern Westphalia, Hamburg, the Rhine, Schleswig-Holstein, Hamburg, Bremen. (2) Prepared by representatives of Brunswick, dividing smaller areas to form two federal regions. (A) Including the Rhine, northern Westphalia, (B) the low-lying areas of Germany. The above-mentioned federal regions will be similar to the state parliament in Stuttgart in the American-occupied area. However, the British military government authorities have not yet formally announced this measure.</p>
<h3>Four Foreign Ministers Meet Yesterday to Seek Solutions to Difficult Problems at the Peace Conference; Stalin's Remarks Clarify the Political Atmosphere</h3>
<p>[Our News] Paris, 24th Broadcast: The four major powers are preparing to hold a meeting at Bidault's office at 4 pm Greenwich Mean Time to end the work of the peace conference by October 15. Stalin's claim that there is no danger of a new war has greatly clarified the political atmosphere in Paris. Bernas's increased credibility due to Wallace's dismissal may also have an impact on the discussions among the four foreign ministers. The most difficult issues facing the peace conference are the status of Trieste and the establishment of a demilitarized zone along the Greek border with Bulgaria. The four foreign ministers may also stipulate the date and location for discussing the peace treaty with Germany. Bernas advocated holding it in New York, but many believe that Molotov prefers to hold it in Europe. Australian representative Hodgson requested that the peace conference be convened again in a year to decide on the issue of Italian colonies.</p>
<h3>My Representative Argues for Libyan Independence</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] Paris, 24th Broadcast: Abyssinia's demand to Italy for the annexation of Eritrea and access to the Red Sea as compensation for losses incurred during Italy's war of aggression against Abyssinia has essentially been guaranteed today. As representatives from various countries discussed this matter, they unanimously supported Abyssinia's request. Western powers such as the British and American representatives, however, all advocated that the final disposition of colonial issues must be deferred for a year. Chinese representative Guo Taiqi proposed placing Libya under United Nations control for several years or immediately granting it independence, which was seconded by the American and Indian representatives.</p>
<h3>Military Committee Passes Resolution to Lift Greek-Bulgarian Border Defenses</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] Paris, 24th Broadcast: The Military Committee of the peace conference passed, by a vote of eleven to seven, an amendment to the peace treaty with Bulgaria proposed by Greece, dismantling Bulgarian border fortifications. Three abstained. Those who opposed were the Brazilian and Slavic representatives.</p>
<h3>The Threat of War is Imminent, The US, Britain and the USSR Should Understand Each Other</h3>
<p>—Speech by Former British Foreign Secretary Eden—</p>
<p>[United Press, London, 24th Dispatch] British Conservative Party wartime Foreign Secretary Eden delivered a speech today, strongly urging a "new military rapprochement" between Britain, America and the Soviet Union, as current relations contain an imminent "threat" of war. He stated that there is no reason why Communism and Capitalism should not coexist peacefully. While Eden's sentiments are similar to those of former U.S. Secretary of Commerce Wallace, he criticized the U.S. for its censure of British imperialism. Eden also echoed former Prime Minister Churchill's support for the formation of a United States of Europe, saying that he wanted to call Wallace's attention to the British Commonwealth, which is "a family of free nations." Regarding the Paris Peace Conference and world relations, Eden said, "It would be foolish to underestimate the seriousness of the situation. The current situation is particularly uneasy. Not only have I seen in this state of affairs the threat of war is imminent, even anyone who reads the news can deduce that with each passing week, feelings of hostility and animosity grow stronger."</p>
<h3>Nuremberg International Tribunal Completes Trial of Nazi Party Organizations</h3>

<h3>Molotov Hosts Banquet for Hungarian Delegation</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 23rd Dispatch] Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov hosted a banquet today for the Hungarian delegation attending the peace conference, and delivered a brief speech, saying that although Hungary and the Soviet Union may have some differences in viewpoints, he remains confident in the future of friendship between the two countries.

<h3>Italians Resentful of England and the harsh conditions of the peace treaty</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Rome, 22nd Dispatch] Italians feel that the conditions of the peace treaty are too harsh on Italy, and unfriendly actions have begun against British soldiers stationed in Italy. Several months ago, when the Royal Marines band performed in Venice, they were met with roars from a large group of young people. The situation has deteriorated ever since. Italian civilians, even military and police personnel, are openly expressing unwelcome attitudes towards Allied personnel. Italians believe that the proposal to divide the Italian fleet is a major blow to Italy's reputation, and they believe that Britain bears a large part of the responsibility for this. Italians also feel that their contribution to the Allied war effort in the later stages of the war has not been adequately recognized by the Allies.</p>
<h3>Spanish Republican Government Officers Form Secret Organizations Within the Country</h3>

<h3>Soviet Internal Purge Movement Occurring This Summer</h3>
<p>—Written by United Press staff member Shakiri Belvin—Special translation by our newspaper's translation office—</p>
<p>[United Press, New York, 24th Dispatch] Many things have happened inside the Soviet Union this summer, but the outside world only knows some fragments. But now we can piece these fragments together and understand their meaning. These many things all indicate that major changes have taken place inside the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>The first to mention this kind of thing was United Press correspondent Hendar, in two telegrams sent from Moscow to the New York headquarters on June 26, which said: "Moscow newspapers are all saying that the National Control Department is eliminating and interrogating factory directors, engineers, and accountants across the country who have falsified production figures, illegally accepted extra party funds, abused factory funds, and used state property for private purposes."</p>
<p>Other dispatches from Moscow since June show that Stalin's post-war purge is not limited to Soviet industry, but also affects various government departments, the Red Army, the Communist Party, and the intellectual community.</p>
<p>In recent days, two-thirds of the four pages of Moscow newspapers have been about the dereliction of Soviet citizens. But this cleanup is different from before, because the crimes are limited to imprisonment and fines.</p>
<p>On July 17, United Press reported from Moscow unconfirmed reports that the famous Soviet hero, Sukov, had been transferred to the post of Odessa Garrison Commander.</p>
<p>Several days later, this news was confirmed, but Soviet newspapers did not mention it at all.</p>
<p>The second Soviet leader to lose his position was Litvinov (Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister). On August 23, the Soviet government officially announced the removal of the 70-year-old diplomat. On the same day, Shi Nuofu, director of the Soviet Meat and Dairy Industry, was also removed from his post. According to Ukrainian Communist Party Secretary Khrushchev, the personnel in Ukraine are being transferred to strengthen the discipline of party members and the government.</p>
<h3>Indian Muslim League Seeks Aid from the Soviet Union, Asks for Support for the Partition of India. Nehru Clarifies Independent Foreign Policy</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 23rd Dispatch] Haroon Din, news secretary for the Muslim League of the Indian province of Sindh, flew to Paris on Thursday to meet with Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov, intending to ask the Soviet Union to support the Muslim League's proposal for the partition of India in the United Nations General Assembly and the Paris Peace Conference. Haroon had just arrived from India. He advocated that the Muslim League send a very strong delegation to Moscow to explain and promote the demands of Muslims. He also contacted the British Communist Party to obtain their support.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, New Delhi, 24th Dispatch] The Central Committee of the Indian National Congress met today, chaired by Nehru, Prime Minister of the Interim Government. He delivered a speech, emphasizing the work facing the committee and particularly stressing that India has entered a new historical stage. He also formally announced his resignation from the post of party chairman. Nehru also said that the Communist Party, which opposes the National Congress everywhere, has lost its credibility. The various steps taken by the National Congress to deal with the Communist Party should not be mistaken as being directed against the Soviet Union. The Interim Government's foreign policy will be independent in nature and does not wish to become a dependency of any foreign country.</p>
<h3>More Than 200 Overseas Chinese in the Dutch East Indies Have Been Evacuated to the Allied Defense Zone</h3>
<p>[United Press, Batavia, 23rd Dispatch] Dutch East Indies military authorities announced today that Dutch troops, at the request of the Overseas Chinese in Tangerang and Sibompu, had evacuated 250 Overseas Chinese to the Allied defense zone.

<h3>A Reminder to Those Naturalized as Americans: Losing Nationality if Not Returning to the US</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 23rd Dispatch] A bill recently passed by the United States Congress stipulates that any person naturalized as an American citizen who resides in their country of birth for three years or resides in another country for more than five years will lose their American citizenship on October 14 of this year if they do not plan to return. However, there are some exceptions, such as those who have resided in the United States for more than 25 years after naturalization, and those who are 65 years of age or older when residing abroad, are not subject to this restriction. In addition, representatives of American companies or institutions whose headquarters are located in the United States, as well as those who are recuperating abroad for health reasons or studying in other countries, may also be considered exceptions. Apart from these, there is no way to avoid it. Naturalized citizens who wish to retain their American citizenship must return to the country to reside.</p>
<h3>Japanese Currency Inflation</h3>

<h3>A Glimpse of the Inside Story of Japanese Politics During the Konoe and Suetsugu Cabinets</h3>
<p>Koiso Believed that Concluding a Treaty with the Soviet Union and Colonizing the South Could Promote the Starting Point for Achieving an Agreement with China</p>
<p>[Kaizo-sha, Tokyo, 24th Dispatch] The Far East International Tribunal continued today with the prosecution presenting German documents, exposing the inside story of the collusion of the Axis powers. After Germany and the Soviet Union signed the Non-Aggression Pact in 1939, Japan was in a difficult situation, so it instructed its ambassador to Germany to suspend negotiations on concluding the Tripartite Pact. In the following year (1940), when the German army successfully carried out a blitzkrieg on the Western Front, Japanese activists were greatly impressed. They again advocated strengthening relations with the Axis powers, ignoring the cautious arguments of the upper echelons of the political world, and accelerated the alliance with Germany and Italy, which ultimately led to a great disaster. From these documents, it can be seen that the relationship between the Axis powers was always manipulated behind the scenes by the German Foreign Ministry, the German Ambassador to Japan, Walter Stahmer, etc., while the Japanese side was dazzled by the current changes and used by Germany. The prosecutor also presented the diary of former Lord Keeper of the Privy Seal Kido, revealing the inside story of Japanese politics around July 1940, when the Yonai Cabinet was forced to collapse and transformed into the Konoe Cabinet, and the decision was made to take the Tripartite Pact route.</p>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 24th Dispatch] The prosecutor of the International Tribunal today read out a secret report from the former German Ambassador to Japan, Walter, to Berlin, proving that Germany informed Japan in June 1940 that if Japan agreed to attack the Philippines and Hawaii when the United States attacked Germany, Germany would allow Japan to act freely in the Dutch East Indies and French Vietnam. The then Minister of Colonial Affairs, Koiso, agreed with this proposal. The cause of the attack on the United States stemmed from Japan asking Walter whether Germany was prepared to mediate between Japan and the central government of China, so as to end the Chinese war in a manner acceptable to Japan. The then Minister of the Army, Muto, admitted that Japan wanted to get involved in Vietnam. Koiso also said that Japan had the possibility of concluding a non-aggression treaty with the Soviet Union, at which time the Soviet Union would probably demand some territorial concessions in northwestern China and Outer Mongolia. Koiso believed that concluding an agreement with the Soviet Union and realizing Japan's colonial desires in the South would not only gradually make Japan economically independent from the United States, but also serve as a starting point for concluding an agreement with China. Walter concluded: "As of now, I believe it is obvious that the formation of a Pacific group composed of China, Japan, and the Soviet Union, combined with Germany, would tie the United States' hands in the Pacific region and deprive it of its freedom of action." Walter's defense lawyer requested that Walter be summoned for cross-examination. Presiding Judge Webb replied that he would decide after consideration.</p>

<h3>How to Drop the Atomic Bomb and Hit the Enemy Thousands of Miles Away—This is the Problem Most Concerned by the US Military Today</h3>
<p>—Written by United Press correspondent Miller—Special translation by our newspaper's translation office</p>
<p>The problem of most concern to the US military's supreme command today is how to drop the atomic bomb on enemy targets thousands of miles away. The US government has issued two public announcements in the past week, both of which lead people to think this way. One is what the White House revealed: the Joint Chiefs of Staff has decided to postpone indefinitely the third atomic bomb test originally scheduled to be held on Bikini Atoll next April. The second is what the Navy Department announced: the 45,000-ton battleship "Kentucky" and the 27,000-ton battlecruiser "Hawaii," which have not yet been completed, will be converted into</p>
<p>Rocket warships</p>
<p>The supreme command is planning to use the remaining manpower and financial resources to focus on studying how to use long-range rockets to launch atomic bombs, rather than diverting resources to atomic bomb tests, because the destructive power of the atomic bomb has already been proven. The Army and Navy are determined not to use the weapons used in the last war when participating in a new war, and are currently working on rocket research, believing that rockets that are remotely controlled and equipped with atomic warheads that can fly across oceans and continents are extremely useful and will inevitably be widely used, so the US Army and Navy both want to</p>
<p>Improve old weapons, but the Navy is deeply afraid of falling behind the Army in this regard. When the Bikini Atoll atomic bomb test was underway, the Army had already launched V-2 rockets in the deserts of New Mexico. As early as July of this year, when the atomic bomb test had not yet been held, Vice Admiral Blandy expressed deep concern about the slow progress of the Navy's rocket research plan. Blandy was both the commander of the atomic bomb test and the director of the Navy's Special Weapons Operations Department. Five days before the second</p>
<p>Atomic bomb test, he said he wanted to return to Washington as soon as possible. Regarding the Navy's research on rockets, he said: "The rocket test has not yet been under my command." However, Blandy and other leaders participating in the atomic bomb test all hoped that the deep-water atomic bomb test would be carried out as scheduled, which was the final and highest-level test of the atomic bomb's power against naval ships. Regarding the postponement of further atomic bomb tests, responsible officials have not openly put forward the urgency of rocket tests as a reason for the postponement, but other reasons do not seem to hold water. Demobilization is a secondary factor, but undoubtedly it is a factor. As for the cost factor, it seems even more unbelievable. White House Secretary Ross estimated that the cancellation of the deep-water</p>
<p>Test can save the country 35 million yuan, but if the military believes that the completion of this test is absolutely necessary for the safety of the United States, then it will never think that the cost is too huge. The military seems to be willing to spend money and manpower in other areas, namely the delivery method of the atomic bomb, which seems to be certain. Atomic bomb testers can collect data from one test and infer what should happen under different circumstances. They can use a small piece of TNT explosive in a pool to test and then roughly deduce the situation of the first and second atomic bomb tests, but often</p>
<p>The results are unexpected, and the situation of the third deep-water test is exactly the same. Blandy said: "That's exactly why we are doing these tests." The first, second, third, fourth, and fifth bombs have proven that the atomic energy released in one billionth of a second has tremendous destructive power, so the deep-water test is indeed necessary and necessary, but the military clearly feels that other new research is more important. The urgent problem at present is not how powerful the atomic bomb is, but how to drop the atomic bomb on the enemy in the shortest time and reach the greatest distance.</p>

<h3>Laying a Solid Foundation for Democratic Politics The Senate Held a Grand Closing Ceremony Speaker Pan Expressed Deep Satisfaction with the Achievement of the Ideal of the General Assembly</h3>
<p>Hoping that the Legislative and Executive Branches will Work Together to Complete the Preliminary Construction of Shanghai</p>
<p>The Municipal Senate concluded its 16-day continuous meeting at 6:30 PM yesterday, completing all agenda items, and held a grand and simple closing ceremony.</p>
<p>After playing music and performing ceremonial rituals, the Speaker first delivered a speech, stating that the General Assembly was extended by two days due to the large number of proposals. During the General Assembly, we were very cautious and worked hard. All the items that should be discussed and the responsibilities that should be borne have been largely resolved. I believe that every colleague has laid a solid and sound foundation for Chinese democratic politics, especially Shanghai democratic politics. What I am most grateful and admire for this time is that the Mayor fully understands the true meaning of democratic politics and is extremely respectful of this Council. He attended and participated in every meeting and tried his best to explain the areas that this Council did not fully understand. Originally, the progress of democratic politics must rely on the mutual cooperation and assistance between the legislative and executive branches in order to be completed successfully. The legislative and executive branches both serve the people. The only difference is that the paths and responsibilities are different. I feel that our spirit in this General Assembly has reached this ideal. I am especially grateful to all colleagues for their enthusiastic attendance. The General Assembly has never been adjourned or failed to meet. It has always been conducted in a tense and enthusiastic atmosphere. This is something that the first Municipal Senate deserves to be proud of. I hope to continue to encourage each other in the future. We feel very sorry and ashamed that the budget passed this time increased the burden on citizens, but we hope that citizens will take the overall situation into account and forgive us. Please forgive me for mentioning the Dagong Evening News again and again. They criticized the budget passed by this Council as very reasonable. On the one hand, we should take into account the pain and burden of the people, and on the other hand, we should also take into account the construction, restoration, and development of the municipality. Therefore, the budget proposal took a lot of time to discuss. Now I hope that the municipal government will immediately recompile it based on the resolution of the General Assembly and submit it to this Council as a basis for assessment and supervision. In particular, I hope that the budget for the next year can be submitted before the second General Assembly of this Council in December, so that it can be reviewed more carefully and meticulously. As for the final account for this year, I hope that it can be reviewed at the third General Assembly of this Council in March next year. The review of the budget and final accounts is indeed the most important task of this Council, so I would like to specifically draw the attention of the authorities and hope that the legislative and executive branches will work together to complete the preliminary construction of democratic politics in Shanghai!</p>
<p>The Mayor's Speech Declared That He Will Follow the Instructions of the General Assembly and Execute Them Without Compromise</p>
<p>The Mayor then delivered a speech, believing that democratic politics has indeed been established in Shanghai. He said: "I feel very honored that the first Municipal Senate is being held during my term. The achievements of the Speaker and all the Senators in the General Assembly can be compared with any parliament in the world without shame. The most feared thing about a parliament is being irresponsible, only knowing how to criticize without knowing how to offer suggestions and instructions. However, this Senate is very responsible and admirable. Now you have fully demonstrated the spirit of democratic politics, and it will be the turn of the administrative side to continue. I can guarantee that I will definitely accept the instructions of the General Assembly and execute them without compromise according to your wishes. Secondly, I hope that after the General Assembly closes, the standing committees of each group will continue to maintain contact with the executive agencies, because legislation is relatively easy, but execution is often not ideal, and even abuses may occur. Therefore, I hope that you will listen carefully and report more. I will definitely accept it sincerely."</p>
<p>The Senators' Response Argued and Decided and Acted. Hoping to Continue Efforts</p>
<p>After the Mayor finished his speech, Senator Tao Baichuan was publicly recommended by the Senate to deliver a reply, stating: "I felt very encouraged by the sixteen days of meetings held by this Council. The Chinese meeting system has not been implemented for long. According to past meetings, most of them have failed, leaving behind four catchphrases, namely, 'Meeting without discussion, discussion without decision. Decision without action, action without movement.' After eight years of the War of Resistance Against Japan, the meeting has made much progress compared to the past. The achievements of our General Assembly can prove this. We are 'meeting and discussing,' that is, since the meeting was held, there has never been a failure to meet. 'Meeting and discussing' and 'discussing and deciding' can be said to have been achieved.</p>
<p>As for whether the decision can be acted upon, this is the responsibility of the municipal government. We have already fulfilled the first half of our responsibility, and the second part needs to be done by the municipal government. I hope that the municipal government can also make progress in administration after eight years of the War of Resistance Against Japan. Our Mayor Wu is a wise mayor. Based on his past talents and experiences, I know that he has faith in democracy and will definitely respect public opinion. I also believe that he will definitely 'act on the decision' after 'discussing and deciding.'</p>
<p>However, just 'acting' is not enough. It must be 'acting and moving.' However, this 'movement' cannot be achieved by the power of the Mayor alone or a small number of competent authorities. Instead, it requires the continuous supervision and assistance of the Senate colleagues to achieve it. Various committees are institutions that represent the future continuous supervision and assistance to the municipal government. Human beings often have inertia. If we are not supervised, we may not work hard. Therefore, I hope that our voters can supervise and help us, so that we have the power to supervise the municipal government. Because with enthusiastic citizens, there will be a loyal parliament, and with a loyal parliament, there will be a sound municipal government. Therefore, we earnestly hope that citizens will supervise us at any time and continue to work hard.</p>
<p>During this meeting, we should especially thank Speaker Pan and Deputy Speaker Xu, especially Speaker Pan, for their hard work (all senators applauded enthusiastically). This parliament has many people and many things. Without Speaker Pan's wisdom and experience to lead and instruct, there would be no such great achievement. We should warmly comfort them (applause again). The journalists this time also demonstrated the public opinion of democratic politics in the newspapers. If the Senate did not have the supervision of journalists, it might have been abandoned halfway. Shanghai newspapers have indeed become the mouthpiece of the people and the vanguard of the Chinese press. We should especially thank the press for this Council."</p>
<h3>Building the Pujiang Bridge Advocate for Citizens' One-Day Donation Drive Readers Sent Letters to this Newspaper for Transmission and Passed by the Meeting</h3>
<p>Proposal No. 31 of the Industry and Commerce Group is a letter from a reader that this newspaper forwarded to the Senate. This letter was written by Mr. Zhang Decai, advocating a one-day donation drive for Shanghai citizens to build the Huangpu River Bridge. After the review committee submitted it to the General Assembly as a recommendation and sent it to the Urban Planning Committee for reference, it was unanimously approved by the General Assembly. Mr. Zhang's proposed methods include singing free operas, holding charity ball games, people from all walks of life donating one day's salary, landlords donating one day's rent, and rickshaw pullers and tricycle pullers donating all fares, etc.</p>
<h3>War of Resistance Losses - Negotiate Compensation</h3>
<p>The Councilors passed Proposals No. 10, 11, and 12 without dissent yesterday morning. The reasons for the three proposals were: to actively handle labor welfare cases, to actively promote cooperatives in various districts, and to guide cooperatives specializing in credit business to revitalize finance; and to negotiate compensation for losses in the War of Resistance, to provide full relief to the victimized compatriots to alleviate the people's difficulties and comfort their hopes. Regarding the valuation of losses, it should be based on current prices. The original method of the Executive Yuan's Compensation Committee, which was based on the occupied prices at the time of the material losses, should be requested by the City Government to be corrected by the Central Government.</p>
<h3>Songhu Road Redirection Issue - Resolution to Maintain Original Route</h3>
<p>Regarding the question of whether to relocate the Songhu Railway, Director Zhao of the Public Works Bureau first explained the method of redirecting the Songhu Railway: The Songhu Railway tracks would be dismantled and moved to the western suburbs of Zhongshan West Road, starting from the point where the Jinghu and Huhangyong railway tracks connect in a straight line, so that Zhabei is laid within the Songhu route, and the original roadbed is rebuilt into an asphalt road, with the addition of trolleybuses and public buses. This would be of great help to the prosperity of Zhabei and Hongkou.</p>
<p>Councilors believed that the Songhu Railway was the first completed railway in modern Chinese history, and that only a few miles had not been repaired, so they advocated that the original route should be maintained and that relocation was unnecessary.</p>
<p>As a result of the vote, with 76 votes in favor, the original route was maintained, and the Songhu Line was to be quickly repaired and restored.</p>
<h3>Engineering Firm Technician Issue</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Interior stipulates that engineering firms must register with one technician. Proposal No. 3 of the Construction Department called for the abolition of this regulation. The reason is that there is a lack of technician talent, and at the same time, the largest buildings in the city, such as the Customs House, Cathay Hotel, and International Hotel, Sassoon House, etc., were all contracted by engineering firms based on experience, without hiring technicians at all. However, since this method is stipulated by the Ministry of Interior, the Public Works Bureau has no right to abolish it. Therefore, the resolution of the Assembly is: This case should be suggested to the central competent department by the Assembly.</p>
<h3>Hardoon Garden to be Converted into a Park - Assembly Unanimously Approves</h3>
<p>Regarding the issue of renting Hardoon Garden as a park in the city to increase places for citizens to relax, Wang Zhuyi stated when the Councilors discussed the Construction Department's proposal yesterday morning: The Hardoon Estate Management Committee had sent a letter to the Councilors, stating that Hardoon Garden was the property of British expatriates, and that they were preparing to build houses to alleviate Shanghai's housing shortage. However, according to Director Zhao of the Public Works Bureau's explanation: Mrs. Hardoon is Chinese, and the estate should be managed according to Chinese law. At the same time, according to the design of the Urban Planning Committee, that area is not suitable for building houses anymore and should be set up as a park. Councilor Wang Zhengting said: There are too few parks, which has a great impact on people's health. If Hardoon Garden is covered with many houses, it will no longer look like a park. Therefore, the Public Works Bureau should absolutely not allow them to build houses again. They should continue to negotiate with them for rent. Most of the councilors applauded and supported it, and the vote passed.</p>
<p>The City Councilors discussed a total of 32 Construction Department proposals yesterday morning. The reasons for the various proposals passed without dissent are listed below: There are many passengers getting on and off at the North Railway Station, and the traffic is congested. A remedy is proposed. The City Government is requested to strengthen traffic management, open up roads in downtown areas, and increase the number of public buses to facilitate traffic in the urban area. Fill in the Zhaojiabang River, which has been silted up, build a vegetable market at the eastern end, pave a road in the middle, and install a wharf at the western station to improve hygiene and facilitate traffic. Because all the ships of various commercial shipping companies suffered heavy losses during the War of Resistance, a compensation proposal is put forward. Add electric lights in various districts to benefit pedestrians and maintain public safety. The City Government is requested to make the method of prospering Nanshi and Zhabei a preliminary plan for prospering Greater Shanghai. A comprehensive dredging of the Huangpu River is proposed. Remove obstacles on Jiaotong Road. Dredge suburban rivers or build ditches. Install tap water pipes in suburban areas to improve sanitation. Extend the period for gradually abolishing rickshaws. Open a city ferry terminal to facilitate the development of city prosperity. Quickly repair the original roads in the city to facilitate traffic and facilitate people's travel. Improve the management of water and land transportation to ensure safety. Restore suburban vegetable markets to improve the appearance of the city. The city's parks should be strengthened in management across the board. Determine the Greater Shanghai Plan. Students and public education personnel are experiencing economic difficulties and should be allowed to ride for free. Organize a wharf warehouse company to improve shipping efficiency, etc.</p>
<h3>Electricity Restriction - Neon Lights to be Prohibited</h3>
<p>Proposal No. 4 of the Construction Department: Prohibit citizens from wasting electricity and expand the power supply to benefit industry. This sparked a fairly heated debate. Ma Shaoquan said: The use of electric heating should be equal. It is too unfair for some people to enjoy it and some people not to enjoy it. Therefore, the current constant heating with electricity should be completely removed. Director Zhao of the Public Works Bureau explained the current electricity shortage situation: "The reason why there is an electricity shortage now is because the machine repair is delayed. We want to ask the citizens to help solve it. Regarding neon lights, we are also preparing to issue an order to prohibit them until the end of February next year." Speaker Pan said: "We see at night that many shops have closed, but the electric archways are brightly lit. It is really necessary to prohibit them. Only fair and reasonable methods can convince people. Those who do not have coal stoves or stoves, even if they use a little electric heating, will have to be removed. How can people eat!" Shanghai currently generates 63 million kilowatt-hours of electricity per month. Excluding the amount consumed by the power company itself, the actual amount is 57 million kilowatt-hours, of which two-thirds are used by factories and one-third is consumed by ordinary users. Finally, the resolution passed on electricity conservation was: "The Public Utilities Bureau will determine the method of restricting electricity consumption based on the principle of fairness and reasonableness. It will also encourage factories to purchase their own generators and assist power companies to repair damaged generators to increase power. The electricity saved will be supplied to factories as much as possible to increase production."</p>
<h3>Finance, Land Administration, and Education Proposals - Continued Discussion and Approval</h3>
<p>In the afternoon, the discussion of the proposals of the various groups continued. Due to time constraints, the Secretary-General read out the reasons for the proposals, methods, and review opinions. Except for a few minor revisions, the rest were passed smoothly.</p>
<p>The important ones in the Finance and Land Administration area from Finance and Land Administration No. 17 to 25 are: (1) Please ask the government to reduce the amount of the field tax quota and convert it into legal tender to relieve the people's difficulties. The City Government will quickly formulate a concrete plan for converting it into legal tender based on the price of cotton and forward it to the Central Government for adoption and implementation. (2) Rectify the discipline of the tax collection personnel of the city's tax collection agencies to stop corruption. The City Council will notify the City Government to send letters to the tax collection agencies to implement it. (3) It is proposed that the government consider reducing the income tax levied on the wages of employees and implement it from September. The method will be sent to the City Government for forwarding to the Central Government for approval. The others passed are: (1) It is recommended that the City Government centralize and unify the payment of materials to reduce manpower and material resources and reduce malpractices. (2) It is proposed that the government levy import tariffs on imported cigarettes at the same rate as domestically produced cigarettes according to market prices to achieve equality and maintain the national cigarette industry.</p>
<p>(3) Allocate a portion of the Japanese reparations and enemy and puppet materials to handle the city's construction matters. (4) Please ask the City Government to conduct a general survey and registration of public and private vacant land in the city and aim for rational use to improve the appearance of the city and make the most of the land. (5) The collection of business tax will be assisted by the industry associations of each industry to the Finance Bureau to increase the city's revenue. (6) Please ask the City Government to forward it to the Central Government to formulate laws and regulations as soon as possible to enable farmers to have their own land, so as to realize Dr. Sun Yat-sen's legacy of equalizing land ownership and to be a leader for all provinces and cities.</p>
<h3>Private School Tuition Issue Sparks Debate Again</h3>
<p>In addition, Case No. 6 of the Finance and Land Department, which was retained during the previous discussion, requests that the government stipulate that the original tenant of a fixed-term lease of a house has the right of first refusal. Because the Legislative Yuan has recently sent personnel to Shanghai to investigate housing disputes and formulate lease regulations, it was decided to send it to the City Government for forwarding to the Legislative Yuan for adoption and revision. In the educational proposals, the issue of private school tuition sparked considerable debate. Huang Bingquan and Bu Guoxian believed that private school tuition was too high and that the principals were making money. Therefore, they advocated that tuition should be charged according to the minimum amount stipulated by the Education Bureau and should be paid in installments. Zhan Wenyu, on the other hand, believed that most private schools were making up for the lack of municipal schools under difficult conditions and solving students' schooling problems. Therefore, there was no need to be critical of tuition fees. The final decision, in addition to the original methods (1) The tuition fee standards of private schools should be determined by the Education Bureau based on the price situation at the time and the actual needs of each school, and strictly supervised to ensure compliance. (2) Private schools should stipulate free and half-free places. Free places should not be less than 20%, and half-fee places should not be less than 10%. (3) The City Government should order the school boards of each school to be fully responsible for planning the funds of each school and reviewing their income and expenditure accounts. In addition, one more item should be added: The tuition fee standard for the next semester should be agreed upon by the Councilors when the Education Bureau sets it.</p>
<p>National schools should be actively increased, and the principle of balanced development in the suburbs should be followed. The Education Bureau should formulate concrete school construction plans and implement phased construction in order to achieve the popularization and improvement of national education in the city.</p>
<p>Municipal Schools</p>
<p>Municipal primary schools should no longer collect disguised tuition fees in any name in the future. Municipal middle schools should not arbitrarily collect teacher appreciation money to ease the burden on citizens. The base salary of municipal school teachers will be adjusted and increased by the Education Bureau based on the principle of fairness.</p>
<p>There are not enough schools, and many students are out of school. In order to remedy this situation, it is recommended that the Education Bureau change all municipal and private large, medium, and small schools to a two-part system of classes to increase the number of places and prevent students from being left out.</p>
<p>Various Educational Proposals Passed</p>
<p>In addition, the proposals passed are (1) Please ask the government to encourage the establishment of private schools and provide subsidies to popularize education. (2) Please organize various welfare matters related to educational practitioners and appropriately increase teachers' salaries to improve the education industry. (3) Please ask the City Government to universally develop secondary vocational schools and prepare for the establishment of a women's normal school. (4) Please ask the government to quickly provide relief to private schools destroyed during the War of Resistance to show encouragement and promote education. (5) The city lacks school buildings. Please ask the municipal government to implement remedial measures separately. (6) Please ask the City Government to universally establish public schools and remedial schools to separately accommodate out-of-school people. (7) Organize an educational inspection team to go abroad to inspect education. (8) Each private primary school should be assisted and supervised by the local district office to facilitate improvement. (9) Use the radio station to add educational programs to instill knowledge in the public. (10) Girls' schools should add courses on obstetrics and gynecology and infant knowledge. (11) Please ask the government to pay special attention to science education and promote science standardization. (12) Please ask the government to promote family education, pay attention to mother education, and establish special personnel to take special responsibility. (13) Please ask the government to organize cultural undertakings loans. (14) Encourage the increase of public and private libraries. (15) Universally promote physical education to save the weak and revitalize the national soul. (16) Please ask the government to award and assist education and cultural undertakings to improve the academic and cultural level and change the social atmosphere. (17) Please ask the government to allocate special funds to renovate the Temple of Literature within a time limit to show respect for Confucius and protect public property. (18) Please ask the City Government to consider building an art gallery in the city center to display ancient and modern art and cultural relics so that everyone can appreciate them. (19) Please ask the City Government to select and implement an order to the Education Bureau to unify public education institutions and determine the central goal to save public funds.</p>
<h3>Various Public Utilities - Can be Privately Operated and Officially Supervised</h3>
<p>Regarding the unification of tram and public bus routes, increasing the number of vehicles, and improving traffic, it is proposed that the Public Utilities Bureau be responsible for urging the companies to implement it to restore order. This is the reason for Proposal No. 5 of the Construction Department. However, the first item in the review opinion is: Various public utilities should be operated by the state in principle, but when the government is in financial difficulty, they may be operated jointly by government and business, or privately operated and officially supervised. However, Xu Yongzuo believed that in the current autumn of government financial difficulties, there is no need to sing high tunes. Since the country cannot come up with the money, it is better to simply return it to private operation. Moreover, everyone has seen how well state-owned enterprises have performed. Therefore, he advocated that various public utilities should be operated privately and officially supervised in principle at present. Wang Zhuyi's statement was: The principle of state-owned operation is based on central laws and regulations, and there is a proviso in the review opinion, which is actually exactly the same as Councilor Xu's opinion. Finally, Councilor Wang Zhengting stood up and suggested: "Various public utilities should be operated privately and officially supervised in principle, unless otherwise stipulated by central laws and regulations." When voting, Councilor Wang's proposal passed with a majority of 79 votes.</p>
<h3>Horse Racing is Still a Mystery - Final Resolution is to Request the Central Government to Interpret the Gambling Portion - While Requesting the City Government to Negotiate to Take Back the Racecourse</h3>
<p>[This newspaper] The "horse racing problem," which has attracted the most attention from the City Councilors and on which they have expressed the most opinions, but which has not been resolved for a long time, was finally brought up at the meeting yesterday before the adjournment for an unprecedentedly tense and heated discussion that lasted for an hour. Those attending the meeting had been waiting for this wonderful scene for a long time. Yesterday afternoon, just as everyone was feeling disappointed because it seemed that the Councilors meeting was not going to end and the discussion of the "horse racing" case would be postponed again, suddenly the Speaker announced that the Assembly had decided to adjourn, and most of the Councilors shouted "Agree!" So the horse racing problem, which was the highlight of the show, was brought to the stage. Many guests were temporarily attracted to the audience seats. Although the result of the discussion inevitably disappointed those who cared about this matter, it was still a preliminary resolution.</p>
<p>The Speaker had long anticipated that the Councilors would have many opinions on this case, but time was limited, so he specifically proposed to limit the discussion to three points: (1) Whether horse racing is allowed; (2) Whether horse racing is allowed in the central area; (3) How to take back the racecourse.</p>
<p>Zhan Wenyu first represented a citizen surnamed Li to complain that his old home, which used to be located at the racecourse and had 43 mu of land, was forcibly purchased by the British without receiving any money. However, the Speaker reported that the Mayor must first give an explanation before this case is discussed.</p>
<p>The Mayor Explains Two Points</p>
<p>The Mayor said at the beginning: "Please feel free to discuss the horse racing problem openly. The City Government will respect the resolution of the Councilors. Please rest assured." Regarding the origin of this proposal, the Mayor said that the Jockey Club came to request the opening of horse racing. At that time, he thought that the racecourse should be taken back and operated by the City Government. This is based on two principles: (1) The racecourse in the city center should not be used to build more houses, but should be used to leave more open space, build parks, and improve traffic. (2) Shanghai is the largest city in the country, but it still has to borrow theaters to hold grand gatherings, which is a loss of dignity. The City Councilors are planning to use the former Japanese expatriate autonomous association as the meeting place, which is also very difficult. Therefore, in the Shanghai urban plan, it is believed that there is no better place to build a convention center or City Council than this.</p>
<p>"Whether to have horse racing or not is another question," the Mayor continued. "I just want to expropriate the land of the racecourse. Regardless of whether horse racing is gambling or physical education, it should be held in the suburbs. The Jockey Club also admits that this is correct. They have agreed that the City Government can expropriate the land at any time, and there is also a written document promising this."</p>
<p>The Racecourse Land Must be Taken Back</p>
<p>The racecourse land must be taken back. This is what we have decided to do. But "where will we get so much money?" We have also considered this issue in many ways. Let's issue public bonds! This land is used for public meeting places, parks, etc. No one is willing to mortgage it. Therefore, under these difficult economic circumstances, we can only think of the method of "taking the wool from the sheep." When repaying the land price, it is impossible to calculate the price of the 500 mu of land at the racecourse according to the land price of the surrounding buildings. But in the contract signed by the Jockey Club and the Shanghai Daotai, it was stipulated that the racecourse land should never be built on. Therefore, when we negotiate, we may propose that the racecourse land cannot be calculated according to the land price of the surrounding buildings. In this way, the tax revenue from horse racing for two years is about 10 billion yuan, which may be enough to complete the transaction. If horse racing is held in the suburbs, we can compensate them with 500 mu of land plus the cost of the current racecourse buildings, which is more reasonable.</p>
<p>According to the previous contract signed by the official government, and the Sino-American and Sino-British treaties stipulate that "property rights acquired by non-fraudulent means shall not be abolished." I am not flattering foreigners, but Shanghai citizens must respect other people's rights with a great national attitude. If they are not allowed to have horse racing, then they have the right to dispose of their own products. I dare not and do not want to advocate horse racing, but from a construction point of view, not taking back this piece of land would be a huge loss to Shanghai. Therefore, I hope that the Councilors can authorize the City Government to first negotiate with the Jockey Club.</p>
<p>Councilors Compete to Speak</p>
<p>Next, the Councilors competed to stand up and speak. The Speaker then stipulated that they would express their opinions in order. Zhang Zhongyuan came up with two methods: (1) The funds required to take back the racecourse can be raised by the City Government issuing public bonds. (2) Use the position of the Councilors to obtain a portion of the materials from the Enemy Property Management Bureau. The funds from the sale will be used to take back the land. As for horse racing, it exists in foreign countries, but it does not necessarily have to exist in China. The United States has "atomic bombs," why don't we have them when we go abroad?</p>
<p>Long Xia believes that it is impossible to recover the racecourse with the tax revenue collected in two years, unless the Jockey Club can guarantee to the City Government that it will definitely sell it to the City Government at this amount after two years.</p>
<p>Lu Entan "absolutely" does not approve of horse racing, saying: "Horse racing is absolutely gambling." He put forward four points: (1) Selling lottery tickets for horse racing is "absolutely" gambling. He wants to ask whether the city's anti-gambling order has been lifted? Otherwise, the horse racing issue cannot be discussed at all. (2) Assuming that horse racing should not be held in the city center, it should not be held in the suburbs either. Gambling is an immoral thing. Why move an immoral thing to the suburbs? (3) The Provisional City Council once passed a resolution to turn the racecourse into Roosevelt Park. Why is there no news of it to this day? (4) Some people believe that to test whether this City Council has a sense of justice, you only need to look at the resolution on the horse racing issue. Therefore, they requested a solemn decision, and all those who oppose horse racing should stand up.</p>
<p>Wang Zhengting Advocates Holding it in the Suburbs</p>
<p>Wang Zhengting felt that this statement was "not very appropriate." He firmly stated: "I personally do not gamble, but horse racing is not gambling and does not hurt anyone. The main purpose of the Mayor's proposal is how to take back the racecourse. But I do not sympathize with the second point. Allowing them to have horse racing for two years is also "inappropriate." Horse racing should not be held in the city center, as it obstructs traffic. What is it like when all the foreign commercial institutions do not work for three days during a horse race? I advocate going to the suburbs to have horse racing. At the same time, the Councilors should jointly find a way with the City Government to take back the racecourse."</p>
<p>Fei Shusheng's tense expression and momentum attracted the attention of the entire audience. He said: "This is my last speech, and I absolutely oppose horse racing. I want to ask everyone to define gambling. Why is buying horse racing tickets and winning or losing not gambling? If we want to promote physical education, how many swimming pools are there in Shanghai, and how many gymnasiums are there? Horse racing is harmless in the United States, but it is very harmful at the time of China's construction. China is a backward country, and it does not pursue good things but learns bad things. I absolutely oppose it. The people who go to horse racing are not necessarily all rich, and there are also poor people who want to speculate. Whether they are rich or poor, we must love them and teach them. I have many more reasons, but there is not enough time. The Mayor said that the racecourse cannot be taken back without horse racing. This is "coercion," and we cannot be "coerced." Unequal treaties were coerced in this way. This is not approved by the 3.9 million citizens of Shanghai."</p>
<p>Wang Liben and Sun Zhenchun also believe that horse racing involves gambling.</p>
<p>Pang Jingzhou wanted to ease the tense atmosphere. He wanted everyone to pay attention to the original proposal, which only mentioned "horse racing" and did not mention "selling horse racing tickets." As for the Mayor saying that he wants to negotiate, he did not say that he has already negotiated, nor did he say that he is confident, so why not wait until he is confident before submitting it to the next meeting for discussion.</p>
<p>Legal Perspective</p>
<p>Ma Junshuo cited the law to break the deadlock. He pointed out that on September 32, the National Government promulgated (implemented on October 1 of the same year) Article 64, Paragraph 7 of Chapter 3 of the Law on Violations of Public Order: "A person who engages in gambling-like behavior on roads, public places, or places where the public can enter and exit" shall be sentenced to detention of up to seven days or a fine of up to fifty yuan or labor service. Therefore, if horse racing is not "gambling," it is at least "gambling-like behavior" and should be opposed.</p>
<p>Zhu Wenqi realized a fundamental problem. He asked: "If horse racing does not involve selling lottery tickets, where will the tax revenue come from? If it involves selling lottery tickets, is it considered gambling?" He approves of horse racing in the suburbs. Zhang Zhihan stood out with an unpopular view. He "approved" of horse racing. He believes that horse racing is not gambling. Because it is very difficult to take back the land, we must find a way. If we can avoid horse racing in the city, that would be better. Otherwise, I also approve of horse racing at the racecourse. The monthly tax revenue of 300 million to 500 million yuan does not necessarily have to be accumulated. It can also be used as the City Government's expenses to lighten the burden on citizens. If Shanghai prohibits it, why don't Qingdao and Hankou prohibit it? If buying lottery tickets is gambling, then are the previous aviation construction bonds and stock exchange transactions considered gambling?</p>
<p>Whether Selling Lottery Tickets for Horse Racing is Considered Gambling</p>
<p>Jiang Pingshen formally moved to ask the Central Government whether selling lottery tickets for horse racing is considered gambling. If it is gambling, then it conflicts with central laws and regulations and there is no need to discuss it at all.</p>
<p>It was the final time for discussion. Chen Gongda and Qu Yue rushed to speak. As a result, Chen Gongda asked, "If you approve of horse racing, would you approve of your own children going to horse racing?" In the previous Shen Bao test, 59 votes approved of horse racing, and there were still 1,225 votes against it. We should take the public's opinion as our opinion.</p>
<p>Qu Yue ended the entire discussion. He was very dissatisfied with horse racing and frowned, saying: "I have lived next to the racecourse for 50 years. Based on 50 years of experience, I hate seeing horse racing. Foreigners even have holidays for horse racing. I think everyone "does not need to bother" discussing it. I guarantee that this case will not pass.</p>
<h3>Improving Traffic on the Huangpu River - Organizing a City Ferry Company Decided to be a Joint Government-Business Venture</h3>
<p>Regarding improving traffic on the Huangpu River and organizing a joint government-business venture for the Shanghai City Ferry Company, these are the contents of Construction Department Proposal Nos. 2 and 19. Several councilors from Pudong, Qu Yue, Lu Huimin, Zhong Yuliang, etc., spoke one after another.</p>
<p>The best way to completely solve traffic on the Huangpu River is to build bridges over the Huangpu River or drill tunnels under the river. Therefore, it was decided to send it to the Public Works Bureau for planning and implementation, and to report to the second general meeting. However, Director Zhao believed that there might not be enough time. Speaker Pan said: It is fine to report a portion first. As for increasing the number of city ferry boats and assisting legitimate private ferries, improving wharves, and other methods, please send it to the Public Utilities Bureau for active implementation.</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of the City Ferry Company, there is one key issue: one is the navigation rights of private ferries, and the other is the term of the City Ferry Company. But in the end, they were both reasonably resolved. For places such as Gaoqiao and Donggou, the City Ferry Company should respect the vested navigation rights of private ferries that had been sailing before the War of Resistance. The term of the City Ferry Company is set at 30 years, but from the 16th year, if the city treasury is abundant, it can be taken back by the City Government. This is because Director Zhao explained that if the term is set at 30 years, merchants will not be willing to invest because the term is too long and they will not be able to earn back their capital, then it will not be successful. As a result, Zhu Wende proposed the above compromise method, which was passed by a majority.</p>
<h3>Final Decision on Two Principles</h3>
<p>In the end, the issue was resolved through voting, but resolutions were only passed on two principles: (1) With 80 votes out of 120, "Whether the sale of lottery tickets associated with horse racing constitutes gambling should be referred to the Central Government for interpretation" was passed. (2) With 113 votes, "To recover the racecourse, the Municipal Government is requested to expedite negotiations and report the progress to the next General Assembly of this Council" was passed.</p>
<p>Whether Shanghai will have "horse racing" at all remains to be seen, and we can only await the Central Government's response.</p>
<p>Proposal to Abolish Fuel Control</p>
<p>Following the heated debate on the resumption of horse racing, several temporary motions were raised: (1) Councilor Wang Zhengting proposed: "In order to alleviate the coal shortage panic among Shanghai citizens, this Council, on behalf of the four million-plus citizens of Shanghai, suggests to the Central Government authorities the abolition of fuel control by the Fuel Management Committee, so that citizens can freely purchase, transport, and sell fuel to alleviate the people's difficulties," which was resolved and passed. (2) Councilor Chen Peide proposed: "In view of the recent continuous rise in prices, it is proposed that the Municipal Government, in conjunction with various trade associations, discuss effective measures to curb the situation," which was resolved and passed. (3) Councilors Shen Ding and others proposed: "It is proposed that the Municipal Government order the Municipal Education Bureau to promptly adjust its affiliated institutions, reduce expenses, and promote national education," which was resolved and passed. (4) Councilors Shen Ding and others proposed: "The collection of various fees by national education classes should be strictly prohibited," which was resolved and passed. (5) Councilors Chen Ruhui and others proposed: "It is proposed that the Municipal Government request the Respect Teachers Movement Committee to allow the allocation of the remaining more than 60 million yuan of Respect Teachers donations to the Municipal Education Loan Committee for the tuition fees of the 9,000-plus loan applicants of this year. We respectfully request a public vote on this matter," which was resolved and sent to the Education Bureau for consideration and implementation. (6) Councilor Wu Zhengkuo proposed: "It is proposed that the Municipal Government promptly comply with the Executive Yuan's order to allocate all the buildings of the Huangpu Police Precinct to the Municipal Court for use." It was quickly resolved to request the Municipal Government to promptly allocate suitable buildings for the use of the Municipal Court. (7) As delegated by the Speaker, the resolution on the Council's declaration and the reports on the administration of various bureaus will be refined by Councilors Tao Baichuan, Feng Youzhen, and Jiang Pingfan, then published separately and forwarded for implementation, which was resolved and passed. (8) As delegated by the Speaker, the temporary motions that the Council's General Assembly did not have time to discuss will be submitted to the Council's various specialized committees for review and handling, which was resolved and passed. (9) As delegated by the Speaker, the petitions accepted by the Council's General Assembly will be submitted to the Council's various specialized committees for handling and forwarded to the Municipal Government for implementation, which was resolved and passed.</p>
<h3>Organizational Rules for Various Committees Amended and Approved</h3>
<p>The Council amended and approved the "Organizational Rules for Various Committees of the Shanghai Municipal Council" yesterday morning, totaling ten articles. It stipulates the establishment of eleven committees, including Autonomy, Finance, Land Administration, Education, Society, Police Administration, Public Works, Public Utilities, Budget and Final Accounts, and Regulations. Each committee shall have three conveners and shall meet once every two weeks. The various committees are formed by volunteer participation of councilors, but each councilor must participate in at least one and at most two. The number of members of each committee shall be at least fifteen and shall not exceed thirty-five.</p>
<h3>Deputy District Director of the Central Statistics Bureau Dies from Accidental Gun Discharge During Official Business</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Zou Ya'fu (from Sichuan, 40 years old), Deputy Director of the 11th District of the Central Statistics Bureau in Xiaoshichiao, Pudong, visited the room (No. 602) of his friend Zhang Yongjiang, a hardware merchant, at the Central Hotel on Guangdong Road at 8:00 PM yesterday. At 11:45 PM, Zou attempted to unload the bullets from his own pistol, but inadvertently triggered it, accidentally injuring his chest, resulting in immediate death. The hotel reported the incident to the Lao Zha Police Precinct. Director Shi personally led officers Zhang Guodong and others to investigate. Upon hearing the news, the General Bureau also dispatched a photographer to the scene to take pictures of the situation. According to Zhang Yongjiang, Zou and he had met in Chengdu, and Zou had no family in Shanghai. Since opening the room on the 12th, Zou came to visit almost every day, but unexpectedly this happened.</p>
<h3>Adopting an Attitude of Not Being Overly Demanding but Not Relaxing Towards the Municipal Authorities; Upholding the Principle of Not Wasting but Not Being Stingy Towards Citizens' Burdens; Declaration Issued at the First General Assembly</h3>
<p>This Council was established on the anniversary of the August 13th Shanghai Battle. Since convening on the 9th of this month, it has been two weeks and two days. In accordance with the procedural rules of this Council, all reports, inquiries, discussions, and resolutions have been completed successively. At the beginning of this General Assembly recess, we respectfully inform the elders of the city and the municipal authorities of the important aspects of the deliberations and future expectations.</p>
<p>Shanghai has a history of over 100 years since it was opened as a commercial port. Through various efforts, it has long become an important center of finance, industry, commerce, and culture in our country, known as the most prosperous international city in the Far East. However, in the past, due to the existence of concessions, the division of governing power, local autonomy could not be completed, and a representative body of public opinion could not be born. Now that the War of Resistance has been won, the national territory has been restored, the unequal treaties have been abolished, and the Shanghai municipal administration has achieved unification. This Council convened its first General Assembly on the anniversary of the victory of the War of Resistance, exercising its powers on behalf of the people of the city in accordance with the Municipal Council Organization Regulations, with particular emphasis on the examination of budgets and final accounts. Towards the municipal authorities, we adopt an attitude of not being overly demanding but not relaxing; towards the citizens' burdens, we uphold the principle of not wasting but not being stingy. The citizens are like shareholders, this Council is like the board of directors, and the Municipal Government is the management. This Council is the organ that determines policies and supervises the Municipal Government, and it should fully exercise its powers in accordance with laws and regulations. During the meeting period, this Council has listened to reports and raised questions to various bureaus and departments of the Municipal Government, as well as the Housing Allocation Committee of the Executive Yuan's Shanghai agencies, the Shanghai Branch of the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, and the Enemy and Puppet Property Handling Bureau of the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui Regions. Various proposals have also been discussed separately and resolutions have been made, which have been sent to the relevant agencies for implementation. Among them, the most relevant to the citizens is the review of the Municipal Government's budget for the second half of the 35th year [1946], resolving to reduce expenditures and moderately increase donations and taxes, so as to balance revenue and expenditure. At present, the value of the currency is declining, prices are fluctuating, and there are many things to be done, which are urgent. Finance is the mother of all governance. If we want to carry out municipal construction, we must raise funds to meet the needs. In order to ensure that municipal expenses and citizens' burdens are taken into account, this Council cannot but moderately accept the Municipal Government's proposal to implement new taxes. However, the revenue from new taxes is designated for construction expenses, in line with the principle of taking from the people and using for the people. As for administrative expenses, we strongly urge the Municipal Government to reduce them as much as possible and continue to cut unnecessary expenses in order to save unnecessary expenses. Whether the Municipal Government's budget can be implemented in accordance with this principle in the future, this Council has decided to adopt a strict stance to supervise it and use this as a standard for evaluating the work of the Municipal Government. In the future, with the existing funds available for municipal construction, it can be expected to be gradually promoted and developed, making Shanghai a first-class international city.</p>
<p>After this Council recess, eleven committees will be established to assist the Speaker in continuing to exercise powers, supervise the Municipal Government, and listen to the opinions of the citizens. The various committees will strictly assess and urge the administrative facilities of the various bureaus and departments of the Municipal Government to implement the resolutions of this Council, in order to avoid the drawbacks of making decisions but not implementing them.</p>
<p>After eight years of the War of Resistance, industry and commerce in this city have declined, people's livelihoods have been difficult, and municipal construction has been left undone in many aspects. Rescuing the industrial and commercial crisis, solving the housing shortage, organizing traffic, and increasing the number of schools are particularly urgent. Although this Council has exhausted its knowledge and ability to pass some solutions, regarding rescuing the industrial and commercial crisis and promoting reconstruction and reconstruction, this Council has also resolved to send a delegation of eleven people to petition the Central Government, making statements in the hope that the central government can strongly promote the revival of the city and accelerate the construction of a new Shanghai based on the Three Principles of the People. However, since this matter is of great importance, we still hope that all citizens will jointly assume responsibility, each doing their best to achieve success.</p>
<p>Shanghai is an international city with more than four million Chinese and foreign citizens. Among them, many foreign citizens of friendly countries have lived in this city for a long time and regard it as their second home. This Council treats all residents of the city equally, regardless of nationality or occupation, and without discrimination. If citizens have high opinions on municipal administration, we hope that they will provide them to the various committees at any time. This Council will accept them as much as possible and submit reports in order to fulfill the obligation of speaking for the people. We hope that you will urge and assist in all resolutions of this Council in order to achieve their success. May the municipal administration be fortunate, may this Council be fortunate. This declaration is hereby made. September 24th, 35th year of the Republic of China [1946].</p>

<h3>Bizarre Murder Case in Yinxian Lane, Nanshi: A Female Corpse Strangled and Moved Here; No Mud on the Bottom of Her Socks, a Handkerchief Tied Around Her Neck; Remains of a Ya Pear and Two Fruit Candies; Garment Shop Employee Heard a Man and Woman Arguing</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] On the open space in front of No. 16 Yinxian Lane (formerly Jixiaofang) on Xundao Street, Nanshi, at 7:00 AM yesterday, an unidentified female corpse was discovered, head to the south and feet to the north. The deceased was approximately 27 or 28 years old, wearing a blue floral white-bottomed cloth cheongsam, an undershirt, shorts, and yellow long silk stockings, with no shoes, permed hair, and gold teeth. A light-colored handkerchief was tied around her neck, and there was mud in her mouth and nose. Wang Shijingnan (from Yuyao), a young woman living inside No. 16, discovered the body when she opened the window and reported it to the captain of the 13th Jia, who reported it to the Penglai Police Precinct. Director Yao ordered Chief Yao Yuanlong, along with officers Wu Zhipeng, Wang Muyin, Sergeant Tong Bocha, Fang Gaoshan, and others, to proceed to the address. Outside the back door wall of No. 16, they found a woman's glass hair tie, half a Ya pear, and two pieces of fruit candy next to the body. A crowd of onlookers gathered. Afterwards, the precinct reported to the Municipal Police Bureau, which sent personnel from the photography department to take photos of the scene for family identification. When taking the fingerprints of the deceased, they discovered a rectangular gold ring mark on her right ring finger, but the gold ring was missing. It was also determined that the deceased had been strangled, but the bottom of her socks had no dirty mud, suggesting the possibility that the body had been moved. According to an investigation of the surrounding area, several hours before the incident, an employee of a tailor shop on Jingtong Road faintly heard two men on the road outside the door strongly urging a woman to return to her hometown, while the woman insisted that she would rather die than comply. Then their voices and arguments faded away. It is generally speculated that the above situation may be closely related to this murder case. The police bureau is now hoping that the family of the deceased will come to identify the body so that the case can be solved quickly. However, as of late at night, no one had gone to the bureau to claim the body. When the corpse was lying under a large tree at No. 16, Director Yao gathered the chiefs of the 16th, 17th, and 18th Bao and Jia to inquire door-to-door whether anyone recognized the deceased, but no one did. Then, the foremen of various military uniform factories were summoned to the scene. They stated that those employed by the factories were temporary short-term workers and that there was no roster. However, the deceased had a beautiful face, and her hands did not appear to have done any work. Therefore, the police have assigned two officers to be responsible for investigating this bizarre murder case and have set a time limit to solve it. It is speculated that this murder case may also contain elements of a love affair.</p>
<h3>Chen Guolian Speaks: Shen Ke is a War Prisoner</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] During the trial of the libel suit filed by Shen Ke, a former Nazi suspect, against Lundell of the United Press, the lawyers on both sides argued fiercely over whether the German expatriates sent back to their country were "bad guys." Yesterday, this reporter made a special visit to Mr. Chen Guolian, Director of the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, to inquire about the truth. Mr. Chen replied that when our country repatriated German expatriates, they were actually regarded as "Prisoners of War" rather than "German expatriates." When the office previously provided proof of Shen Ke's identity at the request of the United Press, it only stated the facts and did not add any comments. The Western newspapers' statement that the office referred to Shen Ke as "Obnoxious" is not consistent with the facts.</p>
<h3>Acting as Agent for Tax Payment and Cargo Pick-up; Unaware of Interception</h3>
<p>Continued News of Suspected Smuggling by US Military Officer</p>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Yesterday's report on the case of suspected smuggling by a US military officer, involving US lawyer Roger, was said to be that Roger was actually entrusted by the officer, Warner, to bring the goods to customs to pay taxes, but unexpectedly he was intercepted at this time. Warner, a US Navy lieutenant, took advantage of his position to ship a large number of luxury goods from the US to Shanghai via military mail, as his father and brothers worked in various US military locations overseas. Recently, nylon glass silk stockings, lipstick, perfume, and other items were shipped, divided into ten packages, along with a letter. However, because Warner himself had been detained by the US military, he wrote to US lawyer Roger, entrusting him with full authority to handle all cargo pick-up and tax payment procedures. He initially thought that since the offense was smuggling, once the taxes were paid to customs in accordance with regulations, the goods could be legally extracted. However, the District Attorney's Office had obtained a tip-off beforehand and had already sent personnel to the US Navy Post Office at No. 2 Beijing Road to lie in wait with customs and the police. Therefore, as soon as Lawyer Roger picked up the goods and came out of the post office gate, he was intercepted by the waiting personnel.</p>
<h3>The Investigation Group is Nearing Completion; All Cases That Cannot Be Handled Will Be Transferred to the Respective Competent Authorities for Continued Handling</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The investigation group has decided to conclude its work and return to Beijing at the end of this month. With only five days left, the group is working intensely to complete its tasks. Group leader Zhang Zhiben reviewed documents piled a foot high yesterday morning and afternoon. According to the person in charge of the group, the cases that the group cannot handle will be transferred to the respective competent authorities for continued handling. Cases involving criminal matters will be transferred to the judicial organs. If administrative officials have committed corruption or fraud, the Supervisory Envoy's Office will review them. If an administrative punishment is illegal, an administrative appeal can be filed with the higher-level competent authority. If the appeal is not accepted, an administrative lawsuit can be filed with the Administrative Court. In the future, if various illegal matters are discovered, they can all be reported to the competent authorities in accordance with legal procedures. It is also heard that after the group returns to Beijing, if there are any unfinished documents, the Joint Office of the Investigation Group will be responsible for receiving and sending them on its behalf.</p>
<h3>Admiral Sir Bruce Fraser to Arrive in Shanghai Today; Australian Minister to China to Come Along</h3>
<p>Admiral Sir Bruce Fraser, Commander-in-Chief of the British Pacific Fleet, is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai from Nanjing around noon today. The British Consulate is making preparations to welcome him. Also, the Australian Minister to China, Mr. Copland, will be coming along with Admiral Fraser.</p>
<h3>Unauthorized Transactions; Two Merchants Penalized</h3>
<p>In order to crack down on speculation and manipulation of coarse grains and oil cakes, the Municipal Social Bureau ordered the Shanghai Coarse Grain and Oil Cake Commercial Association to supervise its members, strictly prohibit brokers from entering and leaving the market, curb speculative transactions, and pay attention to illegal transactions by merchants and brokers in order to stabilize oil prices. The bureau also sent personnel to various markets for on-site secret investigations for several days and discovered that two brokers in the market, Zhu Runhong and Shen Jiagu, had engaged in unauthorized transactions. They have been penalized separately: (1) Shen Jiagu, considering that it was his first offense, was ordered to suspend entry into the market for one week. (2) Zhu Runhong, being a repeat offender, was ordered to permanently cease trading in the market.</p>
<h3>Citizens Can Use Checks to Mail Property Tax Payments</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] This year's summer property tax collection began on August 1st. For the convenience of citizens, the Municipal Finance Bureau, in addition to stipulating that citizens can use crossed checks with the payee listed as "Shanghai Municipal Finance Bureau" along with the payment slip and mail them to the tax collection office in their respective districts, recently negotiated with the Municipal Bank for the bank to assist in collecting donations.</p>
<h3>Forcibly Registering Towboats; Shipping Industry Asks for Cessation</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The Shanghai Inland River Shipping Commercial Association recently reported that the Caojiadu Boat Registration Office of the Public Utilities Bureau, in conjunction with the Water Police Precinct, is forcing all towboats to register. Any resistance may even result in the detention of the boats. However, according to the Ministry of Transportation's Towboat Management Regulations, mass inspections are the responsibility of the Shanghai Maritime Administration, and the boat licenses are issued by the Ministry of Transportation. Therefore, these towboats do not need to be registered with the Public Utilities Bureau again. The association has sent a letter to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, requesting the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau to investigate and stop this practice in order to maintain shipping.</p>
<h3>The Qimei Ship Returned to Shanghai Yesterday; Captain Talks About Being Beaten</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Qimei ship transported 48 soldiers of the Armored Instruction Corps from Tianjin to Shanghai, and then transferred to Xuzhou at Dagu Port. Captain Shi Xueliang was unreasonably beaten by the soldiers of the corps late at night. The ship has now returned to Shanghai, and the soldiers involved have disembarked in Tanggu. According to the captain, the personal insult suffered this time is a small matter, but the protection of general seafarers is of great importance. In addition to reporting the incident to the military police in Tianjin, he has also reported the details to the Bureau. He has also reported it to the Association of Mariners, which plans to send a telegram to the whole country within days, demanding protection for seafarers and punishing the perpetrators. It is heard that Bureau Manager Xu Xueyu will also go to Beijing soon to report to the Ministry of National Defense, Ministry of Transportation, and other agencies, demanding punishment for the soldiers.</p>
<h3>Shen Fenggang, One of the Special Agents of the Puppet Regime, Continued to Be Tried Yesterday Afternoon; Shen Shubo and Zhou Lunwu's Cases are Transferred Due to Lack of Jurisdiction; Yang Yongrui Sentenced to One Year and Three Months in Prison</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] In the case of Shao Shijun, the head of the puppet Ministry of Finance's Taxation Department, and Shen Shushi and Zhou Lunyuan, who concealed Shao's illicit property, the High Court ruled that the cases of the second defendant Shen Shubo and the third defendant Zhou Lunyuan were transferred to the local court for trial due to lack of jurisdiction, while the first defendant Shao Shijun is still wanted.</p>
<p>Yang Yongrui, the public relations officer of the puppet Foodstuff Association, was sentenced to one year and three months in prison and deprived of public rights for two years by the High Court yesterday.</p>
<p>The case of Shen Fenggang, one of the main special agents of the puppet regime, continued to be tried in the High Court yesterday afternoon. Shen is 35 years old, from Funing. In 1939, he came to Shanghai under the leadership of Li Chuchen to work secretly. Later, he was captured by the enemy and defected to the puppet regime. On August 9 of the same year, Li Chuchen invited the defendant to room 302 of the Cathay Hotel to secretly discuss the assassination of Li Shiqun, with Shen responsible for the inside line. Unexpectedly, Shen reported this news to Li, and Li arrested and killed Li Chuchen and others. In addition, he successively killed Su Shaotao, a member of the Central Party Headquarters' Action Committee in Shanghai, Yu Yanzhi of the Military Intelligence Bureau, and many others. As a result, he was promoted to the chief of the Third Division and captain of the First Special Task Force of the puppet Special Agent Headquarters. When Li Shiqun launched the Jiangsu Qingxiang campaign, Shen served as the Qingxiang Inspection Director and secretly reported to the enemy Gendarmerie to arrest underground workers such as Jiang Yaowen, who were released after a large bribe. During the last trial, the defendant denied all the confessions he had made to the Military Intelligence Bureau and did not admit to any of the charges. Yesterday, Wang Xuenong and other witnesses provided favorable testimony for the defendant. The case was postponed for another hearing.</p>
<p>In addition, the case of Zeng Guangyan, who successively served as the head of the Construction Department and Education Department of the puppet Zhejiang Province, and as the administrative commissioner and Education Department of the puppet Huaihai Province, was postponed for another hearing after the investigation.</p>
<p>In addition, the case of Xue Youwen and Hu Chengson, detectives of the puppet Shanghai Putuo Road Police Precinct who framed underground workers, was postponed for another hearing due to the absence of witnesses. The cases of Fan Cunzheng, a Baojia instructor of the puppet Beiqiao District Township Office in Shanghai County, Zhou Genyao, a small worker of the puppet China Railway Company, and Wu Changgui, who were suspected of being traitors, were all detained for further investigation after the court hearing.</p>
<h3>Overseas Chinese Returning Home; Applications Started</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Overseas Chinese Affairs Office of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission has begun to handle the application procedures for overseas Chinese returning home in order to facilitate the return of overseas Chinese. The following is a summary of the "Notice to Overseas Chinese Applying for Returning Home" formulated by the office:</p>

<h3>Even Wheelbarrow Pushers on the Bridge Have Gangs; Homeless Former Soldiers are Humiliated While Seeking a Livelihood; Hand Grenade Used as a Talisman; But Unexpectedly Violates the National Law</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] It is said that even the so-called "bridge pushers" who make a living by pushing rickshaws over the bridge have gangs. Therefore, if homeless people who have not joined these gangs rashly try to earn some meager money with their own strength, they will encounter the obstruction of this evil force and even suffer a beating.</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, on the North Sichuan Road Bridge, a 17-year-old boy from Guangdong named Xiong Quanyu was trying to push a wheelbarrow over the bridge, but unexpectedly he was surrounded by a group of local bullies, who threatened to punish him and forbade him from "entering the water." However, the young Guangdong boy was unwilling to be outdone, and in a flash he brought out a hand grenade, declaring that if anyone dared to insult him again, he would rather die together!</p>
<p>Of course, the power of the hand grenade was great. The mob did not expect him to have such an amazing weapon, so they dispersed like birds and beasts. However, at the same time, one of them reported to the nearby police and had him detained at the Huangpu Police Precinct. After being interrogated, he confessed: "I was originally a soldier, but I was recently discharged from the army. I have been unable to find a livelihood and have drifted to Shanghai. When I left, I did not return an old hand grenade. Later, I thought that this dangerous item was not safe to carry around, so after arriving in Shanghai, I buried it at the abutment of the Lao Zha Bridge. Unexpectedly, this time I was accidentally humiliated for the sake of life, and in a moment of desperation, I dug it up, intending to stage a "stratagem of the empty city" to scare them, but unexpectedly I committed the crime of privately carrying military weapons."</p>
<p>Breaking the law should of course be punished, so the police precinct transferred him to the court in accordance with the law. But whether he will have the freedom to "push wheelbarrows on the bridge" when he regains his freedom in the future depends on the facts in the future. But if he encounters beatings again, he will no longer have a hand grenade as a talisman.</p>
<h3>Two Swindlers Arrested for Exchanging Large Bills for Small Bills</h3>
<p>Yang Dunhou from Nantong, residing at No. 5 Wangshengfang, Fuyu Road in Nanshi, makes a living by running a cloth stall at the entrance of Puqing Lane on Fujian Road. On the 20th of this month, around 10:00 AM, three middle-aged men in military uniforms approached Yang with two bundles of red Customs Gold Unit notes, claiming to be 200,000 yuan. They asked Yang to exchange them for smaller bills. Yang, seeing their well-dressed appearance, did not suspect anything. Without opening and checking the bundles beforehand, he exchanged them for 500 yuan in small bills, and the men left. Later, upon inspection, he discovered that the outer layer was 100 yuan Customs Gold Unit notes, but the inside was all 5 yuan or 10 yuan legal tender. However, the men had already gone far away, leaving him with nothing but regret. Yesterday, around 5:00 PM, Yang happened to be passing Fuzhou Road and Shandong Road when he saw the same three men from the other day using the same method to exchange large bills for small bills from another villager. Yang stepped forward and exposed the scam, managing to grab one of the three men. The villager also helped to grab another, while the third man escaped. The two men were handed over to the Laozha District Police Station. Upon interrogation, one was identified as Meng Wusheng, 27 years old, from Henan, and the other as Gao Jie, 31 years old, from Anhui. They had previously served in a certain military unit but were now retired. They arrived in Wuxi from Xuzhou on September 11th and came to Shanghai recently, staying in Room 402 of the Far East Hotel on Xizang Road. The fugitive was named Shi Dingwen. They confessed to using fake bills to deceive naive villagers. They also admitted that around 10:00 AM on September 19th, they exchanged ten stacks of fake bills for 200,000 yuan in legal tender from an unnamed man at the intersection of Jiujiang Road and Jinhua Street. On the morning of the 20th, they used the same method to defraud Yang Dunhou's stall of 200,000 yuan. That afternoon, the three of them took a train to Hangzhou for sightseeing. In Hangzhou, they patronized prostitutes and toured the lake. The day before yesterday, they brought a Hangzhou prostitute named Huang Lindi to Shanghai and set up shop in Room 402 of the Far East Hotel. Because they had spent all their money, they attempted to defraud another villager yesterday using the same method. As a result, Yang saw them and they were arrested. After the interrogation and investigation of the two criminals, they will be transferred to the District Procuratorate for legal proceedings today.</p>
<h3>Three Police Officers Prosecuted for Failing to Find Stolen Goods but Extorting Money</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Wang Chunhua, a plainclothes police officer from the Dachang Branch of the Municipal Police Bureau, previously claimed to have discovered that workers at the Central Chemical Factory were stealing paint and selling it to a traveler at a certain address in the Sutai Hotel on Fuzhou Road. On July 13th of this year, at 7:00 PM, he invited plainclothes police officers Yang Zufu and Zhou Hongfu from the same bureau to secretly investigate the hotel. They discovered that the guest in Room 228 was a paint merchant, but the guest was out at the time. They only saw a large quantity of paint in the room. The three officers then left. Later, at No. 48 Yu's Residence in Zhabei, they arrested Tan Afu and Wu Jinkun, accusing them of suspicion of theft. Tan and Wu pleaded to be spared detention because it was too late, and the Baozhang (ward chief) guaranteed that they would report to the bureau the next day. The next day (the 14th) in the morning, Tan and Wu went to the bureau with the Baozhang. Wang Chunhua and others interrogated the two men and then took them to Room 228 of the Sutai Hotel to identify the stolen goods. At this point, Tan and Wu did not admit that the paint in the room was what they had stolen and sold. Unable to identify the stolen goods, Wang Chunhua and others beat Tan and Wu and detained them. In desperation, Wu promised Wang Chunhua and others 1 million yuan to settle the matter, and the guest in Room 228, Qian Jingshui, guaranteed the payment. Around 8:00 PM that afternoon, the families of Tan and Wu entrusted Xie Mingshan to deliver 450,000 yuan to Qian Jingshui, who handed it over to Wang Chunhua and others. The remaining amount was paid off the next day (the 15th). Around 9:00 PM on the 15th, Tan and Wu were released. On the morning of the 15th, Wang and others went to the Sutai Hotel to demand the remaining money. Tan and Wu pretended to invite them to drink wine at the Juchang Restaurant on Simalu Road and secretly reported them to the bureau. Wang Chunhua, Yang Zufu, and Zhou Hongfu were arrested and transferred to the District Procuratorate for investigation and prosecution. The trial was held in the District Court yesterday, and all three defendants denied the charges. The court ordered a retrial at a later date.</p>

On the afternoon of August 13th, he brought a hacksaw, steel file, pliers, screw drill, and vise, and rode his bicycle to the airport. He sawed off a control stick and four steel pillars. After police investigation, it was discovered that the aircraft was materials received by the Chinese Air Force in Jiangwan. Li was arrested and sent to the Jiangwan Police Station and then transferred to the District Procuratorate for investigation and prosecution. The defendant testified in court yesterday: He usually had an interest in mechanical engineering. Out of curiosity, he took the parts home to study them, not knowing that it was against the law.

<h3>Ministry of Interior Re-amends the Ordinance for the Examination of Water and Land Maps; Prohibits the Newly Published Map by the Shanghai World and Geography Society</h3>
<p>[Dispatch from Shishi Society, Nanjing, 24th] In order to prevent domestic publishers from carelessly printing maps of China's waters and land, the Ministry of Interior has re-amended the "Ordinance for the Examination of Water and Land Maps," stipulating that all maps of China's waters and land, except those compiled by the Ministry of National Defense and the Ministry of Interior, must be approved by the Examination Committee before they can be registered and issued. Maps printed abroad must also be approved by the Examination Committee before they can be issued or sold in China. Further dispatch: The Map Examination Committee of the Ministry of Interior has recently instructed the Nanjing and Shanghai Municipal Governments to prohibit the newly published "World New Situation Map" by the Shanghai World and Geography Society. According to relevant sources, the map was revised and reprinted after January of the 35th year of the Republic (1946), but its content is extremely erroneous, which the authorities cannot tolerate. For example, Taiwan and Korea are still listed as Japanese territories in the map, which is absurd. In addition, the map also incorrectly marks the undetermined boundaries of China, the Soviet Union, India, Afghanistan, and China-Burma, and mistakenly includes important areas west of the Congling Mountains to Jiangxinzhou within the territory of other countries. This not only hinders our country's sovereignty and diplomatic progress, but also degrades our country's culture and national system, and subjects us to ridicule from foreigners. Therefore, it is decided to prohibit the map to show our seriousness.</p>

<h3>UNESCO International Education Program: Preparing to Launch a Mass Education Movement in China</h3>
<p>[British News Service, London, 24th] The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) opened a new headquarters in Paris yesterday.

For the past ten months, the committee's headquarters were located in London and subsidized by the British government, and its secretariat staff were seconded by the British Council.

Later, Sir Ernest Barker resigned due to illness and was succeeded by the renowned British biologist and sociologist, Dr. Julian Huxley. In a recent broadcast speech, Dr. Huxley compared the work of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization in overcoming the spiritual famine and mental poverty of the world with the work of the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization in combating physical famine and poverty. The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization has achieved great success in its work in London. The committee has drafted plans for scientific education and cultural relief in European and Far Eastern countries that have suffered war and is preparing to launch education movements in Mexico, China, the Soviet Union, Turkey, and many colonies. The committee has also begun to study the compilation of history, geography, and civics textbooks to eliminate the roots of international friction and misunderstanding. In addition, the committee is preparing to convene a conference on educational broadcasting in Europe, investigate the function of art in general education, and attempt to form a machine for excellent translation. There are also many long-term plans, including plans to use film to facilitate teacher and student education, plans to organize adult education discussions in China and India, and plans to establish an international university, an international youth camp, an international family and social design association, an international drama association, and an international association of applied mathematics. The above are just a few examples of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization's achievements in London over the past ten months.</p>
<h3>Soochow University Restores Its Campus</h3>

<h3>Rumors Abound, Rampant Speculation, US Dollars Exceed 4,000 Yuan, Highest at 4,380 Yuan, Gold Prices Also Driven Up to Over 40,000</h3>
<p>[Reported by This Newspaper] Although the authorities have repeatedly stated about foreign exchange rumors, it has not helped the situation. Yesterday, foreign currency buyers were excited. US dollars opened at 3,890 yuan in the morning, and once fell to 3,860 yuan. The buying interest gradually started, and soon it broke through the 4,000 yuan mark. Buyers continued to make efforts, so the supply was exhausted. There was even a rumor that the US dollar exchange rate would be adjusted to 4,200 yuan from today, and it was also said that it would have to be raised to 5,000 yuan. At noon, the US dollar soared to 4,380 yuan. In the afternoon, there were some settlements by the multi-party, and it fell to within 4,100 yuan. As a result, it rose by 260 yuan compared to the previous close. The exchange rate against gold was close to 536 yuan or more per ten taels. Hong Kong dollar was chaotic, and it once rose to about 850 yuan. It was slightly stronger in the afternoon, and the result was 50 yuan better than the previous close. Hong Kong exchange rate was stable and strong at first, and slightly adjusted to 800 to 820 yuan in the afternoon. Indian exchange rate was 1,000 yuan, British exchange rate was 13,000 yuan, and US dollar to dollar trading was quiet.</p>
<p>Gold bars are also gradually advancing. Even with controls, it is useless. It opened at 2.187 million in the morning with sales. There were many settlements, and it was once seen falling to 2.17 million yuan. The US dollar side came to help buy again, and it was immediately brought up to outside 2.2 million yuan. When it rose to about 2.23 million yuan, it was slightly curbed. After 10 o'clock, the Central Bank allocated 100 bars at a price of 2.21 million yuan. At this time, it was quite peaceful. When the US dollar was again in short supply and rumors flourished, it was stimulated to rise again, and it stood at a high price of 2.26 million yuan at noon. In the afternoon, the US dollar was also small, and the gold market lost support. The next-day settlement fell back to below 2.23 million yuan. As a result, it rose by 40,000 yuan compared to the previous close. Jewelry was listed as high as 2.37 million yuan. Silver dollar was flat. The black market rose in the stock of speculation. The money market was slightly tight, and the black market interest rate rose to about 1.5%.</p>
<h3>The Chinese Stock Market is Suddenly Clear, as Many as Seven Types Hit the Limit Up</h3>
<p>Yesterday, a large number of financial speculators entered the Chinese stock market, and the situation changed. The northern speculators also covered their short positions, but the trading-table speculators mostly settled profits in the middle, and once saw a fallback. After 11 o'clock, the footing was stable, and buyers from all sides rose up. After 11:30, it began to look good. Dahua Match was the first to turn red after being bought by China Exchange Bank at No. 225, and it rose to the limit price. Then, Xinnuo at No. 157, Zhongfang at No. 232, Jinglun Datong Cement at No. 198, Jingfu at No. 36 and No. 224, and Underwear at No. 42 and No. 4 were bought, and they were successively pushed up to the limit around 11:30. The two major hot stocks and various small stocks also approached the maximum limit. Near noon, profit-taking long positions poured out, and there was quite a bit of weakness. Meiya went from 4,460 yuan to once falling back to the scene of 4,300 yuan in an instant. It was still able to stabilize before the close. People's hearts were flying, and the trading table changed. In the last few tens of minutes of trading, there was a lot of curious chasing. Large households with profits also had some sales. As a result, Yongsha, Meiya, Jingfu, Xinguang, and Qinxing all rebounded by about 15% compared to the previous close. In the unpopular stocks, Zhongtong, Yiyi, Wuhe, and Zhizao rose slightly by 5%. Huafeng rose by slightly less than 10%. Zhongfang, Xinnuo, Datong, Underwear, Jinglun, Xinya Company, Lian Match, Silk Industry, and Cement each rose by 15% to 20%. The total turnover reached 9,764,800 shares, of which Yongsha was 4.05 million shares, and Jingfu and Xinguang were each around 1.5 million shares. Xinnuo was 664,000 shares, and Meiya and Qinxing were each about 450,000 shares. Outside the market, each stock only rose slightly due to lack of time.</p>
<h3>Public Bonds Rebound</h3>
<p>Public bonds were still flat and tired at first. Near noon, affected by the Chinese stock market, there was also buying. Tongbing opened at 1,810 yuan in the morning and once fell to 1,760 yuan before stabilizing. It was stagnant for a long time. Finally, due to the indirect encouragement from the Chinese stock market, it rebounded to 2,150 yuan and then stabilized slightly. As a result, it rose by 330 yuan compared to the previous close. Jia Yi rose by 280 yuan, Ding Hao rose by 180 yuan, and Wuzhong also rose by 230 yuan. The turnover was only over 4 million yuan at face value.</p>
<h3>Foreign Stocks Also Rebound</h3>
<p>Foreign stocks had Western merchants coming to buy, and they also showed stability. However, because the securities speculators have not yet moved, the style is not as good as Chinese stocks. Yisha rose from 8,900 to 9,500, and then slightly rebounded. As a result, Yisha and Yinglian each rose by 10% compared to the previous close, and the rest were brought up by about 5%.</p>
<h3>Levy of Transaction Tax</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Securities Exchange announced to all brokers that it would levy a transaction tax starting today, stating: The Securities Transaction Tax Regulations have been promulgated by the National Government on the 20th of this month. According to Article 8 of the regulations, it should be implemented from the date of promulgation, but the Ministry's order has not yet been formally issued. If it waits for the order to be implemented, the retroactive payment procedures will be complicated. It is hereby notified by the Supervisory Office that it should be levied from September 25 of this year. It is hoped that all brokers will be informed.</p>
<h3>Chen Tea Sells Well</h3>
<p>The overseas tea market dislikes the high price of new goods, and still has an appetite for Chen tea. Recently, there have been repeated calls to choose cheap transportation. Therefore, various firms are scrambling to grab it. Especially Qi Hong is easier to sell, and the selling price has also progressed again and again. As a result, high and low goods have risen by 15,000 yuan to 20,000 yuan per dan compared to the previous price. In addition, Bai Lin's new black tea is also sold as it is seen. In addition, Chen Chouzhen Chen Tegong, etc., are not lacking in trading. As for domestic sales, coarse hairy red from Wenzhou is in even greater demand, and other varieties have a beautiful color in the process.</p>
<h3>Raw Sugar Rises Again</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market was not very different, but the price of raw sand rose again because it had fallen too much in recent days. The association set the price of spot medium sand white at 137,000 yuan, and the price of raw sand was initially 118,000 yuan, and then 119,500 yuan, an increase of more than 5,000 yuan. The Shantou gang offered hundreds of bags of Huanggang green at 115,000 yuan. The Jian gang offered Quanzhou second white at 111,000 yuan to 128,000 yuan, Quanzhou foreign at 125,000 yuan, and Diaoqing at 109,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Total Amount of Tung Oil Sold to the US</h3>
<p>Only 13,000 Tons This Year US Merchants Transport New Machinery to China</p>
<p>[Reuters, New York, 23rd] Only five or six thousand tons of Chinese tung oil have arrived in the United States this year, and the total amount for this year is unlikely to exceed 13,000 tons. In the year before the war, 75,000 tons of Chinese tung oil were imported, and even in 1940, despite the impact of the Japanese invasion, 48,500 tons were imported. Regardless of the fact that Chinese tung oil production is lower than before the war, most of the tung oil produced is distributed to Europe. Tung oil imported into the United States used to account for 75% to 80% of China's total output, but now it has been reduced to 50%. In order to help increase the production of Chinese tung oil, a well-equipped new oil pressing equipment has been transported to China by a trading house in San Francisco.</p>
<h3>Japanese Silk Dumped in the US Affects Sino-US Sales</h3>
<p>Recently, Japanese silk was publicly dumped once in the United States, and it is now preparing for a second dumping. The quantity is quite large and the price is cheap, which has greatly affected the Sino-Italian silk business. It is reported that the governments of the two countries have ordered their ambassadors to the United States to negotiate with the United States in order to obtain a reasonable solution to the silk price.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cloth Prices Surge Wildly, Spinning and Building Quotas Are Too Small, and Prices Are Also Raised, Manufacturers Are Unwilling to Sell Due to Difficulty in Replenishing Raw Materials</h3>
<p>[Reported by This Newspaper] Yesterday, the surge in the yarn market continued, because gold and dollars both rose wildly. The yarn market opened at a jump of 100,000, and there were few sellers. Then, the price gradually rose to 570,000, and buyers did not hesitate to increase the price to absorb it. The rise in people's hearts was unprecedented. As a result, the price of 20-count yarn rose by 150,000 to 200,000 compared with the previous day. Especially the 20-count small and medium-sized yarns were almost on par with the Shuangma, Dafa, and Golden Rooster yarns of large factories. 16-count yarn was even more outstanding, and it was also sold at 1.757 million, the same price as 20-count yarn. The reason for this is that the distribution price of spinning and building has increased sharply in the past two days, and the quantity supplied is extremely small, and there are many people who withdraw their orders, so the market has formed a situation where supply cannot meet demand. Because the procurement of this street and weaving factory is very active, the supply and demand are out of balance, and the trend of rising prices has permeated the market. In general, the price of each yarn has risen by about 10%, and the trend is still extremely stable. At the opening of the cloth market in the morning, people's hearts were still extremely firm, and the opening price of spinning and building was nearly 10,000 higher than the previous period, at 72,000 yuan. People in the market generally believe that the successive increase in the opening price of spinning and building has promoted the sharp rise in the black market. People's hearts are panicked, and white printed twill has soared to a high point of 78,000 yuan. Therefore, the market fluctuation is even more intense. Private factories, due to the difficulty in entering raw materials, have agreed not to sell the only semi-finished products lightly, and must wait until the raw materials are replenished before they can supply them to the market. It is even more difficult for real sellers to replenish their goods. Moreover, the black market exchange rate has risen sharply to the scene of 4,300 yuan. Because of this, people's hearts are even more uneasy, and it is hoped that the spinning and building authorities can generally increase the application amount of purchase orders, so that the market price can tend to stabilize under the situation of rising prices. Today, blue V fine cloth is 82,000 yuan, Sijunzi old goods twill is 90,000 yuan, and Wufu fine cloth is 80,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Purchase of Japanese Cocoons Rejected, China Sericulture States Position, Very Small Purchase Amount Cannot Monopolize Japanese Cocoons, Japanese Accusations Are Not Reasonable</h3>
<p>The China Sericulture Corporation's purchase of Japanese silkworm cocoons was rejected by MacArthur's headquarters. Magana, the textile consultant of the headquarters, also stated that we colluded with American merchants to plan to monopolize Japanese silk for profit. The words were extremely sharp and have aroused astonishment in our government and the public. Officials from our side expressed deep regret over Magana's statement. Ge Jingzhong, the general manager of China Sericulture Corporation, stated the following: (1) China Sericulture Corporation is a government agency for developing the silk industry, guiding private management and improving it. It is not a commercial organization. (2) President Song has never participated in the affairs of the company, but only approved the establishment of the company in order to revive our post-war silk industry.</p>
<p>Serious Losses Suffered by Our Silk Industry During the War</p>
<p>(3) During the Anti-Japanese War, China's silk industry suffered extremely heavy losses. Before the war, there were more than 30,000 silk reeling machines, but now there are only 10,500. One-third of the production machinery and equipment was lost. Before the war, the silkworm cocoons in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces could produce 100,000 dan, but now the spring and autumn silkworm cocoons are only more than 70,000 dan. The raw material production is reduced by one-sixth, which is only enough for half a year, and there is still a shortage of raw materials for half a year. Therefore, we urgently need Japanese negotiated cocoons. Last year, Lu Xixiang, the silk special envoy received by the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry (currently the deputy general manager of China Sericulture), agreed with Tao Sen, the agricultural counselor of the US Embassy, ​​to purchase 300,000 silkworm seeds and 2 million mulberry seedlings for the purpose of reviving silk when he was receiving them in Shanghai, and submitted them to President Truman for approval.</p>
<p>Purchase of Silkworm Seeds and Mulberry Seedlings Approved by the United States</p>
<p>Ordered MacArthur's headquarters to handle it in an exchange method, and it was not successful until March of this year. Because we suffered heavy losses in silk during the war, raw materials were lacking, and factories were at risk of suspension. The company, standing in the position of reviving our silk industry, specially entrusted General Zhu Shiming, our representative in Japan, to purchase Japanese silkworm cocoons in April of this year. After several negotiations, no results were obtained, and it was suspended. It is reported that the Japanese side refused to sell to us because our silk quality was low, frequent labor strikes occurred, and fuel was insufficient. However, the above points are not reasonable. If it is said that our quality is low, our quality in the European and American markets is not lower than Japanese silk. Our silk factories have never had labor strikes. Even if the fuel is insufficient, the silk factories have not stopped production. In order to solve the silk crisis, the company requested our delegation to continue negotiations three weeks ago, and provided various loss investigation statistics materials, and still adopted the barter method. Unexpectedly, Mr. Ma's statement occurred, which is deeply regrettable. (4) Mr. Ma said that I have monopolized the Japanese silk industry with American politicians and industrialists. Check that the 10 million pounds of Japanese silkworm cocoons we purchased this time are only 11% of Japan's savings, only 6% of the new silkworm cocoons savings. MacArthur's headquarters holds a large amount of Japanese silkworm cocoons, how can we monopolize it.</p>
<p>Losses in Silk Industry Should Be Compensated by Japan</p>
<p>(5) The losses of our silk during the war should be compensated by Japan; now, in order to save the silk crisis and maintain the livelihood of the workers, and to purchase Japanese silkworm cocoons by means of barter, MacArthur's headquarters should not refuse in terms of reason and emotion. Before the report from Zhu took over our delegation, we can only regard what Mr. Ma said as a personal statement. We should continue to negotiate with MacArthur's headquarters in order to achieve success.</p>
<h3>Hong Kong Government Prohibits Gold Imports, Huge Imports Mostly Transferred to Mainland China</h3>
<p>[United Press, Hong Kong, 24th] Government officials here confirmed today that the Hong Kong government has informally banned the import of gold. It is estimated that the gold imported into Hong Kong in the past month accounted for US$3 million. The most recent batch of 34,000 ounces, mostly Mexican gold coins, was shipped from San Francisco in the middle of last week. According to the report, the authorities have banned imports because they found that gold importers have made false statements about the use of gold. It is believed that most of the imported gold is transported to mainland China.</p>
<h3>Unstable Rice Market: Abundant Supply, Sluggish Sales, but Prices Remain Firm</h3>
<p>The rice market continues to receive supplies, with over 11,000 "shi" (a unit of dry volume) registered for purchase. Shops are cleverly taking advantage, causing top-grade rice to recover slightly, rising by a thousand yuan. Medium and lower grades remain stable, while "Baiyuan" rice remains stagnant, dropping by one or two thousand yuan. New and aged "Jing" rice are scarce and firm, but the overall situation remains uncertain. Rice is currently being sorted in warehouses and will be allocated for sale soon. The flour market remains inactive, and there is also a lack of transactions for bran. Due to the arrival of two to three thousand bags of high-quality soybeans from the Northeast, market sentiment has softened, and with Shantou stopping its operations, prices have plummeted by two thousand yuan, entering a slump again. Broad beans are in short supply, rising by a thousand yuan. Wheat from Fujian seems to be losing demand and momentum. White wheat prices are down two to three hundred yuan due to inactivity in the north. Shelled peanuts have dropped by one to two thousand yuan due to the cessation of operations in Southeast Asia. Corn has reappeared downstream, falling by a thousand yuan. Mung beans are neither thriving nor declining, and sesame shows little fluctuation. In the oil market, shipments from Qingdao are being received, causing a shortage of raw oil. Soybean oil and rapeseed oil are in short supply, showing a slight upward trend. Soybean cakes remain stable.</p>
<h3>Establishment of the Industrial and Commercial Supervision Office with Defined Authority: Starting from Specific Points</h3>
<p>It is reported that the authority of the soon-to-be-established Industrial and Commercial Supervision Offices of the Ministry of Economic Affairs will not conflict with existing administrative structures. The purpose of establishing these offices is to investigate the allocation of capital, the number of factories, the supply of raw materials, and the needs of the market in each region, as well as various supervisory matters. The establishment of industrial and commercial firms in various localities will still be submitted to the central government for approval through the Social Affairs Bureau. It is believed that after the establishment of the Supervision Offices, the national capital will be allocated effectively, evenly, and rationally, preventing the pre-war situation where capital was concentrated along the coast, creating an abnormal situation. The Ministry of Economic Affairs is preparing to undertake planned construction of the national economy. Due to current limitations, it will start by establishing specific points before attempting to implement comprehensive control.</p>
<h3>Formation of the Third Industrial and Commercial Loan Syndicate Yesterday</h3>
<p>Following the establishment of the first and second Industrial and Commercial Loan Syndicates of commercial banks, as reported in yesterday's newspaper, the third syndicate was also formed yesterday. The list of members is as follows: China National Products, China Enterprise, China Reclamation, China Encouragement of Industry, Donglai, China, Yongda, Zhizhong, Siming, and China First Trust Company, totaling ten institutions. The merger of the first syndicate with the Central Bank is expected to be signed today or tomorrow.</p>
<h3>Tobacco Industry Delegation Petitions in Beijing Today</h3>

(2) Set the tax rate adjustment period to once every six months. (3) Allow the monthly tax payment to be made by the end of the following month. The association has selected seven representatives to go to Beijing today to meet with Minister Yu of the Ministry of Finance and Director Mei of the Tax Bureau to present their case.</p>
<h3>Promoting Mint Production: Taicang Residents Organize a Research Society</h3>
<p>[Taicang Report] Before the war, the planting area of mint, a special agricultural product of this county, was about 6,000 mu (a Chinese unit of area), with an annual oil production of over 50,000 jin (a Chinese unit of weight), which was exported to the United Kingdom, the United States, and Southeast Asia, accounting for a significant portion of the export trade. After the outbreak of the war, foreign sales were interrupted, prices plummeted, and people stopped planting. After the victory, foreign trade gradually recovered, and people in Muyi (another name for Taicang) specially organized the Mint Production Cooperative Research Society to benefit the rural areas. It was established on the 15th.</p>
<h3>Overcoat Wool Sells Well</h3>
<p>There is continued demand for overcoat wool from customers, with brisk sales in both retail and wholesale. The market is firm due to the scarcity of goods on hand for both buyers and sellers, and few incoming shipments have arrived. Most have not yet been loaded onto ships, and it will be too late when they are imported, so prices are generally firm. However, lower-grade "Yuanchang" overcoat wool is consistently weak, mainly due to the influence of Melton wool, and customer demand is very low. Yesterday, English-made "Kaisui Mi" overcoat wool was quoted at 160,000 yuan per yard, Japanese-made "Kaisui Wei" at 85,000 yuan, "Yapei" at 50,000 yuan, American overcoat wool at 47,500 yuan, "Shililuo" at 55,000 yuan, "Meifeng" at 52,500 yuan, and second-grade herringbone "265" at 33,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Industrial Raw Materials Prices Soar, Orders Halted</h3>
<p>Since the exchange rate adjustment, the prices of most industrial raw materials have only increased by 10-20%, but some have even fallen due to a lack of actual sales. Recently, the black market exchange rate for US dollars has risen sharply, and the sales of various raw materials have recovered well. Therefore, yesterday the market surged across the board. The hot commodity caustic soda rose by 70,000 yuan per barrel. Other items such as soda ash, bleaching powder, Vaseline, and N rosin also rose by 10-20%. It is reported that industrial raw material merchants placed almost no orders abroad in September. According to industry insiders, there are three main reasons: (1) The price of overseas orders is higher than the spot price in Shanghai, and merchants find it difficult to sell their existing stock, so most are stockpiling inventory and not ordering from abroad. (2) Difficulties in shipping goods from abroad have not been resolved, and the arrival date cannot be guaranteed quickly, so it is better to purchase and stockpile spot goods than to place orders. (3) After imported goods arrive in Shanghai, the foreign fees are often comparable to the price of the goods. Handling and unloading costs can be calculated for goods with a higher value, but for those with a large volume and low value, there is often a sigh of reluctance to abandon them and excessive cost to retrieve them.</p>
<h3>Sino-Egyptian Barter Trade: Tea Exchanged for Cotton</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Cairo, 24th] It is announced here that the Chinese government has proposed a barter system with Egypt, exchanging Chinese tea for Egyptian cotton. The Egyptian government has agreed and will implement it soon.</p>
<h3>Cotton Yarn Processing Industries: Surveying the Required Quantity</h3>
<p>Due to the recent surge in cotton yarn prices, the Spinning and Weaving Corporation will re-register and survey various manufacturers to prevent speculation and directly allocate cotton yarn to them. It is learned that the dyeing, weaving, handkerchief, and knitting factories have completed the survey. According to Specialist Shi Quan of the corporation, the hosiery sector, including hand-operated and electric machines, requires 413 pieces per month, and the cotton weaving sector requires 308 pieces of yarn. The survey of the underwear, canvas, and electrical weaving industries is currently underway.</p>
<h3>Third Batch of Raw Silk Purchases: Totaling 375 Bundles</h3>
<p>The Central Trust Bureau's third batch of raw silk purchases includes 50 bundles from Fuhua, 30 bundles each from Huaguang and Yongchang, and 30 bundles each from Dingxin, Huaxin, Lunchang, Dali, and Yongtai. The China Silk Company has been sorting the warehouse receipts and inspection reports submitted by various manufacturers in recent days. The documentation for this third batch was completed last night and will be sent to the Central Trust Bureau this morning to begin handling the follow-up purchase matters.</p>
<h3>Large Quantities of Yarn and Cloth Transported North</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The southward sales of yarn and cloth have disappeared due to the export ban. The "Hanmin" ship sailed to Guangzhou yesterday, carrying only 331 boxes of tea, 102 pieces of newspapers, 220 bags of wheat, 300 blocks of soybean cake, 984 pieces of medicinal herbs, and 4,000 pieces of general merchandise. The "Zhixin" ship also sailed to Tianjin yesterday, transporting over 2,280 pieces of cotton yarn, over 1,020 pieces of piece goods, over 2,419 pieces of tea, and over 700 pieces of paper.</p>
<h3>Summary of Market Conditions</h3>
<p>Dried Longan: New dried longan of various grades have arrived recently, and the quoted price has fallen by 10,000 yuan. However, telegrams from Quanzhou report a rise of 20,000 yuan, so the future market is expected to stabilize.</p>
<p>Lime: Yesterday there was a severe shortage of lime, so the market price rose again, jumping from 13,500 yuan to 15,000 yuan due to the small supply and increased actual sales.</p>
<p>Hardware: Small colored pipes are slightly popular, "Yuan Ding" prices are stable, drawer locks are rising sharply, door locks are slightly better, triangular files are slightly weak, and about 2,000 pieces of "White Brand" grinding wheels have recently arrived.</p>
<p>Timber: The timber market is boosted by fluctuations in various markets, and buyers are eager to purchase. Foreign pine is also becoming firmer after being weak, and fir is also firm.</p>
<p>Tin Foil: The market remained quiet yesterday, with few transactions, because both buyers and sellers are afraid of supplementary taxes due to the requirement to register inventory with the Commodity Tax Bureau, creating speculation and stagnation.</p>

<h3>The Metamorphosis of Washington's Policy After the Downing of the American Plane in the Southern Territory</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent in the United States, Mao Shupu</p>
<p>Tito's Previously Arrogant but Now Submissive Written Confession</p>
<p>[New York News, September 3] American-Soviet diplomacy is always advancing in a tortuous and roundabout way. The scene of Yugoslavia shooting down an American transport plane marks a turning point in the US attitude towards the Soviet Union. Before this "tragedy" was staged, many Americans admired communism. Despite the fact that the political style of communist countries is diametrically opposed to the "democracy" advocated by the United States, people like Les (Dewey's diplomatic advisor) still advocated abandoning America's "democratic" diplomacy and trying to understand the Soviet Union and the even more "progressive" communism than capitalism by compromising and seeking reconciliation. In terms of diplomatic technology, figures like Wallace advocated repairing relations with the "Soviet bloc" in order to establish a false peace. In terms of domestic policy, they advocated emulating the strengths of Soviet economic equality in order to transform the United States itself.</p>
<p>The Efforts of the Left-leaning Diplomats Provoked Great Indignation. The Peace-Loving Prime Minister Took a Boat and Went Fishing. However, the tragedy in Yugoslavia hit the American left-wing dreamers head-on. Acting Secretary of State Mr. Acheson started out as a left-leaning figure in the American diplomatic circle. The day after the plane was shot down, I was in Washington. At the State Department's press conference, I saw him flush with anger, reporting the details of the tragedy and the emergency measures taken by the US government. That day, peace-loving President Truman went fishing at sea, and Secretary of State Byrnes was far away in Paris attending a meeting, so Acheson's responsibility was particularly heavy. His mustache, his British gentlemanly demeanor, speech and behavior made the air around Washington feel as heavy as lead pressing on people's hearts.</p>
<p>The foundation of democratic politics is public opinion, and the public opinion circle roared with anger at the tragedy in Yugoslavia. The most vehement were the Hearst newspapers. The New York American Journal published photos of the aerial heroes who died in Yugoslavia with the headline: "Are we going to let their lives be sacrificed in vain?" The next day, the Journal published the grief of the martyrs' families after receiving the bad news. Mrs. Schleber (one of the dead), mother of Captain Schleber, was weeping loudly on the table. The editors of the Journal commented: "Tito, pay attention, you say that American pilots ignored your territorial integrity, but Tito, you ignored the hearts of hundreds of thousands of American mothers!" On the third day, the family of Sergeant Kang Kuo of Pennsylvania received the news of his death. The Journal published photos of the Kang Kuo family's grief and indignation, and quoted the family's request to "punish the murderers." Next to the photo, the editor wrote: "On August 19, the red fascist executioner Tito shot down an unarmed American transport plane for no reason, murdering our five aerial heroes... These heroes, they have been fighting for several years, defeating the Axis enemy countries. Now that they have won, they are preparing to enjoy the happy life of peace, but they were suddenly killed by the Tito bandit!</p>
<p>"Let our government understand: their death was for obeying orders and for doing their duty. We are a democratic country, and the life of every one of our citizens is priceless. Can't our government make Tito understand? Can't we show Tito and his communist bandits the color of the law?</p>
<p>"Strive for the government to send the murderer to the International Court of Justice and punish him as a murderer should be punished."</p>
<p>The Communist Party Only Fears the Strong: American Newspapers Oppose the Public Release of Atomic Bombs</p>
<p>The American Journal mobilized for more than a week to "redress the grievances" of the tragedy in Yugoslavia. Other newspapers, such as the World Telegram and the New York Daily News, all "condemned" Tito's crazy behavior. The New York "Afternoon News", which has always been very left-leaning, also loudly called on the government to firmly accuse Yugoslavia. The word "Tito" has now become a common headline in New York newspapers. Tito's photos, like Hitler's in the past, are published in various ways. In many newspapers, the name "Tito" is preceded by "Communist Puppet Leader" or "Stalin's Puppet Regime".</p>
<p>The State Department's attitude is also following public opinion. The first time I saw Acheson, he only asked for the release of several pilots imprisoned by Tito. The Tito government, after being instructed by Molotov in Paris, complied with the release. The second time, Acheson asked Tito to apologize and guarantee that the same thing would not happen again, and Tito did so. The third time, Acheson asked Tito to give honor to the victims and hold a grand memorial service. Tito sent the Fourth Army of the Yugoslav Army to attend the funeral and memorial service, and he did so. Later, the State Department asked Tito to make a written "confession" and guarantee that there would be no similar incidents in the future, and to submit it in writing to the US State Department for the record. It is said that Tito also wrote it. However, the American public opinion and discourse have not yet calmed down. Therefore, Acheson asked Tito to compensate and provide compensation, and it is expected that he will also do so.</p>
<p>One American reporter said that to deal with the Communist Party and its running dogs, you have to hit them hard so that they can't recover. He said, "If a good person gives way, a bad dog will take two steps forward. If a good person kicks back, the bad dog will have to run away."</p>
<p>I don't know what the people of Yugoslavia think about this matter. In the United States, Americans compare it to a microcosm of the Pearl Harbor incident. Americans now understand: what is true peace? On Labor Day, the New York Daily News, which sells 4.6 million copies a day, wrote an editorial commemorating Labor Day and Victory Day. The final conclusion was: "If we now tell another country the secret of making the atomic bomb, then we are no different from being naked!" Do the American people agree with this sentence? More than half of the answers are positive! (September 3, New York)</p>
<h3>A Historical Gamble Staged in Sweden: Clever Use of Neutrality to Aid the Allied Nations</h3>
<p>— Translated by Cheng Zhi from the September issue of Reader's Digest</p>
<p>During World War II, a historical gamble was staged on the Scandinavian peninsula, which only a few senior British and American officials understand to this day. This Sweden, which has always been considered pro-Nazi, has been continuously assisting the Allies with important military supplies and various intelligence since the outbreak of the war.</p>
<p>Only two senior Swedish officials know that all important intelligence obtained by the Swedish intelligence agencies is sent to the United Nations Embassy, including details of Hitler's headquarters' daily operations and the V-1.</p>
<p>Sweden is completely surrounded by German forces, so she can only feign neutrality, but in the first year of the war, a large number of rollers and other important equipment were secretly transported to the UK and the US. In 1940, a revolutionary new weapon - the Bofors 40 cm caliber anti-aircraft gun - was secretly transported from Sweden to the United States. Since then, the United States has continuously imitated and manufactured thousands of them. Senior Swedish generals were sweating profusely in the dark armory, secretly boxing and packing machine guns, hand grenades, etc. for the Norwegian underground workers.</p>
<p>After many weeks of investigation, I only knew that a small part of the business and government leaders were involved in this secret work, and they were convinced that Germany would be defeated without a doubt. Of course, there were also many who sympathized with Germany, and a small number of naval and land generals were considered pro-Nazi.</p>
<p>The Nazis insisted on absorbing all of Sweden's exports, but she firmly opposed it. What she wanted was complete free trade. The Nazis demanded more iron ore than before the war, but Sweden not only refused, but actually reduced it by a quarter.</p>
<p>Since the beginning of the war, Sweden's intelligence work has been one of the most accurate and reliable in Europe.</p>
<p>Sweden's intelligence was largely due to many high-ranking German officials who discriminated against Hitler.</p>
<p>On March 30, 1940, a certain doctor visited Mr. S, a Swedish businessman, who was a close friend of a Hitler aide. He learned that the Nazis would invade Scandinavia on April 9, and that the ships needed for the attack had been concentrated in the northern port of Stettin.</p>
<p>Swedish officials dared not easily believe it, and were half convinced and half doubtful.</p>
<p>The next afternoon, a group of church elders in the port of Stettin enjoyed their Sunday walk as usual, gradually sneaking to the seaside and discovering that a large number of workers were loading military supplies onto forty ships. The intelligence officer immediately notified the Swedish and Norwegian ambassadors in Berlin. That night, Mr. S learned from Hitler's headquarters that the German army was invading Norway and Denmark - not Sweden.</p>
<p>The diplomats in Oslo and Copenhagen did not believe this intelligence. The Norwegian Foreign Minister specially visited the German ambassador, who absolutely guaranteed that the preparation of these ships was for the invasion of the Netherlands and Belgium. However, early in the morning of April 9, the people of Oslo were awakened from their sleep by the sound of cannons.</p>
<h3>Maintaining Neutrality and Refusing Nazi Transit</h3>
<p>Thereafter, Swedish public opinion was in an uproar, and the anti-German sentiment rose day by day. Hitler's suspicion also increased. Therefore, the Swedish government sent a semi-official diplomatic mission to Berlin to assure Hitler that Sweden would absolutely abide by neutrality, but with the warning that if Germany attacked Sweden, every military, industrial, mining, transportation and communication facility would be immediately and thoroughly destroyed automatically.</p>
<p>Hitler again requested the railway transit to supply grain, medicine, and Red Cross personnel to the Narvik area. This request was granted under duress, but many combat personnel disguised as Red Cross personnel who passed through were detained. In addition, Germany requested that each train be attached with several carriages of military supplies exempted from inspection, which Sweden immediately refused. In order to take intimidating measures, Germany sent a large team of German aircraft to soar over southern Sweden, but Sweden was unmoved and shot down seven of them:</p>
<p>The Allied landing in Narvik was carried out smoothly, and the situation of the German army in northern Norway became extremely unfavorable. Ribbentrop notified the Swedish government that if the request for military transit was refused again, Germany would not hesitate to sacrifice friendship and attack Sweden to relieve the German army in Norway from its crisis.</p>
<p>On the night of May 17, the cabinet convened an emergency meeting. At that time, a large part of the city had been evacuated, and the borders were heavily guarded. The bridges connecting to Norway were all destroyed. The seriousness of the situation is evident. In the meeting, Prime Minister Hansson was serious and his words were impassioned. He was a steady and quiet person, but in the end his speech trembled slightly "... If we refuse, then we may be invaded and fall immediately. If we allow it, then Norway will become our eternal enemy." After a pause, he continued, "But I think it is better to die a glorious death than to live a shameful life, so this unreasonable request must be rejected."</p>
<p>Everyone agreed without a single dissenting vote.</p>
<p>In the spring of 1942, Germany again planned to attack Sweden. Hitler needed the Swedish railway as a transportation line for the war against the Soviet Union. The preparation plan was completed in January, and it was prepared to mobilize 45 divisions of troops from Denmark, Norway and northern Germany to jointly invade by sea and land. The date was also chosen in late February. However, at the end of January, Sweden received intelligence and immediately mobilized the entire country to prepare for battle.</p>
<p>General Debuk was furious at Hitler's headquarters in Berlin, because Swedish intelligence personnel had revealed their actions without reservation, so he demanded that another 20 divisions be added to conquer Sweden. At this time, Hitler was busy with the war against the Soviet Union, and he did not have time to allocate this army for the time being, so he gave up the idea. Sweden was able to survive.</p>
<h3>Underground Activities: Escorting Atomic Experts</h3>
<p>The amazing deeds of the underground workers in Sweden, Denmark and Norway are truly amazing. Their first great achievement was to find a way to guide the Danish physicist Bohr safely to Sweden, and then to the United States. He was an important figure in the development process of the atomic bomb.</p>
<p>In 1943, Germany decided to massacre more than 8,500 Jews in Denmark. Swedish intelligence personnel had learned of this news ten days ago, so they tried to tell these Jews to gather every night on the Moerma coast facing southern Sweden for rescue.</p>
<p>On this starry night, it was truly an incredible scene. They took rowing boats, bamboo rafts, rafts, wooden doors, wooden boards and even swam. They drifted east in the stormy waves. They were all pale, silent and taciturn, for fear that once they alarmed the German army, they would all suffer. Thin women, men with sad faces, and shivering children flocked in their thousands every night. The Swedish Navy secretly sent countless armed boats, patrolling in the turbulent waves, to prevent German interference. Almost all the Jews in Denmark arrived in Sweden within a week.</p>

<h3>One World or Two Worlds?</h3>
<p>— Chu Yukun</p>
<p>In the past week, Wallace made a speech that caused a great uproar in American diplomatic circles. It was only calmed down after President Truman issued a statement. However, Wallace's letter to the President on August 23 was published in various American newspapers, causing deep unease among the Secretaries of War and Navy, who had to write to the President to deny it. As a result, the divisions within the US government have deepened, becoming irreparable, leaving President Truman with no choice but to make a decision.</p>
<p>Churchill Advocates Franco-German Cooperation</p>
<p>The waves caused by Wallace had not completely subsided when Churchill delivered a speech in Switzerland on the 18th, advocating that France and Germany should set aside their grievances and reconcile, establishing a European alliance based on cooperation between the two countries. He said, "The first step in rebuilding Europe must be through Franco-German cooperation; only in this way can France restore its leadership in Europe; without a great Germany, Europe cannot be revived."</p>
<p>Although Churchill has retired from British politics and is living in Switzerland, given his personal prestige, his statements and advocacy are still valued by various countries. We have no reason to object in principle to his advocacy of Franco-German cooperation; however, Churchill has given several speeches in the past year, first in the United States, advocating Anglo-American cooperation; then in France, advocating an Anglo-French alliance; and now in Switzerland, advocating Franco-German cooperation. Putting all these proposals together, one cannot help but suspect that Churchill intends to organize a Western bloc to resist the Soviet Union. We hope for international peace and cooperation, but we cannot casually endorse any proposal to divide the world into two.</p>
<p>Wallace Resigns to Continue the Struggle</p>
<p>The clamor for "one or two worlds" has not disappeared, and we hear Wallace shouting for "one world." After speaking with Secretary of State Byrnes on the 19th, President Truman decided to order Wallace to resign. According to President Truman's explanation, "The government still supports the foreign policy adopted by Secretary of State Byrnes. The people are of course absolutely free to express opinions that disagree with the government's policy, but the government itself must maintain consistency. Now, it is clear that Secretary Wallace has a 'fundamental conflict' with the government; the only solution is for him to resign. At the same time, I also believe that Mr. Wallace would rather express his views freely as a citizen." Wallace immediately resigned as ordered, without being discouraged, and said optimistically, "I have decided to continue fighting for peace. I believe that the American people can, with the heroic spirit of the late President Roosevelt, join the struggle I lead."</p>
<p>Only One World Can Have Peace</p>
<p>After his resignation, Wallace was free to express his views, and he gave a speech on the 20th, first explaining the reasons for his resignation: "Striving for peace is more important than high office and generous salary." Then he explained his ideal of "one world." He said, "I do not agree with dividing the world into two, and I will continue to advocate the principle of living in one world; there is no peace except for 'one world'." At the same time, he also criticized the errors of the US government's foreign policy, saying that it had failed to recognize the "basic facts" that led to the two world wars, and now threatens a third world war. But the third world war will be a "nuclear war." This serious warning is worth pondering by those who advocate "two worlds."</p>
<p>Paris Peace Conference at an Impasse</p>
<p>Secretary-General Sharq of the Peace Conference, in accordance with the decision of the Council of Foreign Ministers, personally stipulated that all committees of the Peace Conference must complete their work by October 5, so that the United Nations General Assembly can be held as scheduled, but there are still many difficult issues that have not been resolved: the most important of which are (1) the Trieste issue; (2) the disposal of Italy's former colonies; (3) the issue of free navigation on the Balkan Danube; and (4) the issue of Italian reparations, with fourteen countries making reparation claims, none of which have been resolved.</p>
<p>US Will Strive for the Success of the Peace Conference</p>
<p>US Secretary of State Byrnes has won a victory at home, but the difficulties he faces still exist. Therefore, Byrnes must redouble his efforts to ensure the success of the Peace Conference. Otherwise, his position will be shaken. Fortunately, the four foreign ministers are all in Paris, and the Council of Foreign Ministers is expected to reopen to resolve these outstanding issues as soon as possible. If the Council of Foreign Ministers still cannot resolve the issues, then a meeting between Truman and Stalin is also very possible. (September 23)</p>
<h3>Population Increase and Decrease in European Countries After the Second World War: All Countries Decreased Except Germany</h3>
<h3>A Serious Problem! Post-War Germany: Reduced Land, Increased Population</h3>
<p>— Translated from the New York Times Magazine by Nan</p>
<p>The International Committee for the Study of European Problems recently held a meeting in London, attended by experts from many European countries. The theme of the discussion was the impact of the Second World War on the population of Germany and the Allied countries of Europe. The committee submitted a report, which began with the sentence: "The German National Socialist Party not only wanted to conquer territory, but also wanted to increase the German population and weaken the population of neighboring countries, so that it could maintain the superiority of the German nation in the years to come."</p>
<p>Hitler had this goal very early on, and he and his Germans had been moving towards this goal in many ways for many years. Their methods were to encourage marriage and reward childbirth before the war, so that they could have sufficient "biological reserves" after the war began; to do their best to improve air defense facilities and protect civilians; to try to maintain a considerable amount of rationing to maintain the health of the people; and to maintain the normal birth rate during the war. In addition, the most noteworthy point is that most of the Allied countries conscripted women to participate in military and factory work, while German women were not subject to compulsory service, so they could continue to give birth to Germans.</p>
<p>We can find a significant difference by comparing the impact of the First World War and the Second World War on Germany's birth rate. During the four years of the First World War, Germany's birth rate decreased by three million people compared to the usual four years, while in the first four years of the Second World War, Germany's birth rate decreased by only 750,000 people.</p>
<p>In addition, Germany's wartime death toll was also lower than that of European countries. The total number of German military and civilian deaths was 3.6 million, while the total number of military and civilian deaths in European countries opposed to Germany was about 15.4 million.</p>
<p>In addition to massacring combatants as much as possible, Germany also used direct and indirect methods to kill and abuse Jews and people in occupied countries whom they considered undesirable, thus causing the people of Germany's enemy countries to suffer even greater losses.</p>
<p>Germany was indeed victorious in the population war, but it failed in the territorial war. According to the eastern border set by the Soviet Union and Poland for Germany, it lost a quarter of its land, but Germany's population is about 72 million, an increase from 67 million in 1935. One of the important reasons for the increase in Germany's population is that Germans who were originally abroad were gradually repatriated to their home country. As a result, more people have to be accommodated on three-quarters of the land than before, which is indeed a serious problem in post-war Europe.</p>
<p>Before the Second World War, the three Axis countries of Germany, Japan, and Italy used to advocate small land and large population as an excuse to invade other countries. This excuse will of course not be allowed to exist again in the future. In fact, Germany's population density is not denser than that of the United Kingdom or Belgium. As long as Germans work hard to develop their own land and fully exert their inherent abilities, they can still build a stable and prosperous country. However, the current fragmentation of Germany and the barriers between East and West do make Germany's normal development very difficult, and may even lead to a serious crisis. This situation is certainly not a blessing for the German people, but on the other hand, it is by no means a blessing for the Allied countries. Therefore, European politicians should have a broad vision and a prudent attitude to find a reasonable solution to the German problem, which obviously has a decisive effect on the future of Europe.</p>

<p>Spring and Autumn</p>
<h3>The Story in the Cave</h3>
<p>— Shenmo</p>
<p>Late autumn, the sun shoots out its last faint light, dragging its heavy and tired body, and hides in the mountain col to the west. A touch of red light on the horizon fades into a pale gray. The sky darkened.</p>
<p>The village, after the baptism of artillery fire, is in a desolate state, especially the ancient Mei Village, which appears even more decadent and dilapidated. There is no one on the square in front of the village, only a dying old dog curled up, shivering and weeping in the west wind of dusk.</p>
<p>In the village, the dilapidated wooden doors are all locked; only the door of Mei Lao's house is still open. Inside the door, under the trembling, dim candlelight, many people are sitting silently. Next to them are their bedding. The air is so silent.</p>
<p>"Why hasn't he come yet?... It's getting dark." The old Mei Lao, sitting near the door, looked anxious, scratching his bald head, which looked shiny in the candlelight, and grumbled annoyedly.</p>
<p>A month ago, in the season when osmanthus fragranced the air, the Japanese began to occupy this place. Thus, murder, arson, rape, and looting... were constantly being created by them; and were constantly swallowing the hearts of every living person. They felt that all kinds of misfortune would happen to them, and at the same time felt that the black shadow of death was pressing down on them tightly...</p>
<p>How many poor people were killed for no reason; how many poor people had their houses burned down, even lost their lives...</p>
<p>Mei Village, a small village, although it has not suffered any misfortune, yet at night, the shrill gunshots, the mournful cries, the cries for help... No one can sleep.</p>
<p>Therefore, someone proposed digging a cave and living in it at night. Everyone thought the idea was not bad, because the cave was much safer than their homes, and they could sleep soundly at night without having to worry. Thus, the cave was dug.</p>
<p>Today--the first day the cave was completed, everyone could have gone to the cave long ago, but they were still waiting for someone--Tao Xiaoliu. He was a guerrilla member familiar to the village. Because he was curious about living in the cave, he asked to join their group and live in the cave. What could everyone not agree to? On the one hand, he was an acquaintance, and because he had a weapon, he could at least embolden everyone.</p>
<p>"He's here--hey!... He's here, Xiaoliu--" Mei Lao suddenly turned around and said to everyone.</p>
<p>Outside the door, the sky was dim. On the gray ridge of the field, a black shadow was rushing towards the village.</p>
<p>Tao Xiaoliu walked into the house. The candlelight shone on his sturdy body, which was young and still a little boyish. However, he looked determined and decisive. A shiny pistol hung at his waist.</p>
<p>"Let's go! I'm a little late. It's getting dark, and it's hard to walk on the road!"</p>
<p>Everyone stood up, carried their bedding, and stepped onto the narrow, earthworm-like ridge.</p>
<p>The cave was only half a li away from the village, but it was difficult to walk. The surroundings were dark and full of terror. The willow trees by the cave in the distance were dancing in the darkness...</p>
<p>The cave was a large hole, ten feet long and wide, with a wasteland above it; in front of it, a clear stream flowed past, the cave door facing it; next to it, a large willow tree sheltered the entrance of the cave door.</p>
<p>Everyone crowded into the low doorway one after another. The first thing they felt was the smell of newly dug soil--musty, depressing, making everyone frown involuntarily. There was no way, they groped in the dark to spread out their bedding and lay down...</p>
<p>However, it was not as peaceful as they imagined. Except for the children, everyone was tossing and turning on their beds, listening to every sound, worrying about a misfortune happening, and remembering their homes in the village... Even Xiaoliu, who had experienced suffering, could not fall asleep.</p>
<p>"Sigh! This life!" Someone sighed.</p>
<p>Suddenly--</p>
<p>"Bang... bang... bang..." "Gada gada gada..."</p>
<p>After the long gunshots, came the rapid-fire machine guns, so close, so shocking...</p>
<p>"What--they're firing?" Everyone in the cave was startled and suddenly sat up.</p>
<p>"Wah--" The child woke up from a sweet dream and cried at the top of his lungs.</p>
<p>"Don't cry!" The father shouted.</p>
<p>"Ah! Good boy, darling, don't cry, good boy, don't cry..." The mother coaxed, trembling.</p>
<p>It was no use, the child cried so loudly. Everyone felt terrified and blamed them.</p>
<p>"You little devil! Are you trying to die?" The father scolded sternly and angrily.</p>
<p>Under excessive tension, terror, and panic, the mother subconsciously stuffed the clothes next to her tightly into the child's mouth to stop the crying. The child struggled in her hands. Not crying, it gradually seemed to fall asleep.</p>
<p>The bullets no longer whistled over the cave, and it was silent. Everyone breathed a sigh of relief.</p>
<p>"Oh dear, no... That's not good, quick... quick... light, the child... was suffocated by me..." Touching the child's cold body, the mother screamed.</p>
<p>Under the candlelight, the child's pale face still had tears on it, but it was motionless and no longer crying.</p>
<p>"It's over"--The despairing and sorrowful father couldn't help but cry bitterly.</p>
<p>The mother almost fainted. The cave was in chaos...</p>
<p>"Don't shout! Hey! Listen!" Xiaoliu shouted straightforwardly and blew it out...</p>
<p>A burst of scattered footsteps came from far to near, heading straight for the cave... The footsteps slowed down.</p>
<p>From the panting, scattered footsteps, and talking, it could be proved that this was a large group of Japanese soldiers who had just been defeated. They sat down to rest by the big willow tree beside the embankment.</p>
<p>The people in the cave were full of terror, but Xiaoliu's eyes were blazing with fire. He touched his weapon:</p>
<p>"Damn it! You ran into me! Humph!..." But he didn't pull the trigger after all. It was not because he cherished his own life, but because he thought that more than twenty poor innocent people would lose their lives because he pulled the trigger.</p>
<p>Under the faint moonlight, the Japanese soldiers' bayonets gleamed on the tips of their guns. Some were yelling strangely, and some were quietly talking in strange, incomprehensible words. But they were all disheveled.</p>
<p>The howling wind blew down raindrops as big as yellow soybeans, and they fell harder and harder. The Japanese soldiers all stopped jumping and yelling and fled to the dense branches and leaves of the big tree...</p>
<p>The people in the cave became even more terrified, Xiaoliu's eyes sprayed with more fire, his nerves were agitated with hot tension, and he trembled so much that he almost pulled the trigger...</p>
<p>But the fact told him that he really had to pull it, because, under his sharp gaze, a black shadow clearly discovered the cave and was telling everyone...</p>
<p>"Bang--bang..." When the Japanese soldiers were about to approach the cave to investigate, mad bullets flew out of the cave, and the black shadows fell down one by one...</p>
<p>"Gada gada gada..." A few seconds later, the bullets poured into the cave like locusts. The sound covered the sound of the wind and rain; Xiaoliu's gunshots; the screams of the cave; and even their own roars...</p>
<p>A few seconds later, all the sounds stopped, and only the howling storm remained. The Japanese soldiers cut Xiaoliu's body with bayonets, scolding him with extreme hatred, and insulting him as much as possible. But this was no longer relevant.</p>
<p>The storm continued, and water poured into the cave, mixing with fresh red blood, and all twenty-odd corpses floated up...</p>
<p>Quotations from Tagore</p>
<p>— Tian Rui</p>
<p>Only those who love can discipline people.</p>
<p>Our names are the light shining on the sea waves at night, and nothing remains after death.</p>
<p>If you put gold on the wings, then the bird can no longer soar in the sky.</p>
<p>Life receives its assets from the demands of the world, and receives its value from the demands of love. We misunderstand the world and say that it deceives us.</p>
<h3>The Love of a Petrel</h3>
<p>— Jiang Shangqing</p>
<p>One late night, I braced my emaciated body in the storm and rushed back to the dormitory. Under the lamp, I saw that my body was soaked by the rain like a water duck.</p>
<p>An extraordinary memory knocked on the door of my heart, and my thoughts galloped to the vast distance: If it were a swallow perched on the seashore, what kind of thoughts would arise?</p>
<p>Such thoughts are indeed very naive, but such things are very common today. When a peacock or parrot who knows how to cherish its feathers is cowering in a cage, it is precisely a petrel returning in the storm on a late night.</p>
<p>As for me, do I still have to use such a beautiful story to explain myself? Living through life shows so many fragments; if there is any memory, it is also groping in the midst of the hateful eyes of the world, liked by a few, and hated by most. Each time when I walk the last steep mountain path in the wind and rain, I always tap the mountain stone with my cane and it echoes softly. He often mutters to himself when he flies back to his old nest in the wind and rain: "Another storm has passed."</p>
<p>Thus, when I lament the thinning hair at the temples of my friends, I see white hair on my own head in the mirror; if I have a good memory, this should be enough to alarm me. Now I live in this bustling and oppressive city, and passing one day seems like a year. Although my heart is stubborn, it is already trembling in the wind and rain of this world. This distant journey after another is coming at me. You say, will I shrink back and be conquered in the wind and rain of this world? I am used to seeing the petrels on the sea, and I will bravely fly to the distance, rush through this stormy night, and usher in the light, usher in a bright future.</p>

<h3>"Gentleman's Friendship"</h3>
<p>— Zhang Houqian</p>
<p>Ever since I heard the term "gentleman's friendship", I have approached him with peace of mind. Originally, can't there be pure friendship between men and women?</p>
<p>He has also repeatedly stated that the reason why he is willing to be with me is purely for my simplicity and enthusiasm. He wants to beautify me with his wisdom and knowledge, not like the pursuit of ordinary people. I have always believed this.</p>
<p>That day he said he would take me to the movies, so I dressed up early and waited. I wore a newly made lotus-colored cheongsam and matching earrings, feeling that I wasn't too tacky.</p>
<p>Who knew that after he sized me up, he threw down his hat and sat on the sofa to scold me, saying that girls should pay attention to inner beauty, and that it is not right to try to please people with their appearance. He also said: "Don't think that I know you because you are good-looking, let me tell you, I have never paid attention to your appearance."</p>
<p>I was so angry that I took off my earrings and burst into tears on the sofa.</p>
<p>Finally, he changed his attitude and coaxed me in an elder brother's tone: "Maybe my words were a little too intense, but my heart is always good. I am not your "boyfriend", why do I always have to condescend to you? Don't cry, crying will make your eyes swell and not "good-looking"..."</p>
<p>I asked him what he meant by "good-looking", and he had nothing to say.</p>
<p>I finally caught the movie, and I was still wearing my earrings.</p>
<p>A very honest girl has recently joined our music class, with long pigtails and thick lips. After talking to her a few times, I really like her simple attitude. I told him and asked him to come and see our class.</p>
<p>After seeing it, he had no expression.</p>
<p>"How about asking her to join our gentleman's agreement?"</p>
<p>He shook his head.</p>
<p>"How about introducing you?" He shook his head again.</p>
<p>"Isn't it good for the three of us to be friends?"</p>
<p>This time he spoke: "Why call her a "vegetable addition""?</p>
<p>I said we are also lovers, how do you explain that?</p>
<p>He patted me on the shoulder and said, "You don't understand."</p>
<p>I forced him to explain.</p>
<p>He smiled and said: "I don't understand either."</p>
<p>Although he is only five years older than me, he always treats me like a child, sometimes coaxing me, sometimes scolding me, and always holding me when crossing the road.</p>
<p>That day, on the way home from school, he put my left hand in his right arm and patted it from time to time with his left hand. I was immediately misunderstood by my classmates when they saw it, how could they understand that we are "gentleman's friends"? I wanted to pull my hand out, but he wouldn't let me, so I questioned him:</p>
<p>"Do you treat other friends like this?"</p>
<p>"You're the only pure friend I have."</p>
<p>"What about your sister?"</p>
<p>"I don't have a sister, only a cousin."</p>
<p>I know he used to be with his cousin. He used to walk like that.</p>
<p>"But it's not the same when I walk with my brother," I said.</p>
<p>"Not even your cousin?"</p>
<p>"Also no!" It wasn't until I firmly denied everything that he let go.</p>
<p>My home is not far from us. (End)</p>
<h3>An Inch of Land is an Inch of Blood 43</h3>
<p>— Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>This fellow was in the midst of roaring when he caught sight of a neat and orderly armed detachment, approximately ten pairs, passing by outside the guest room door and entering the adjacent room. Although a bamboo curtain hung on the guest room door, it was clearly visible from the inside. In less than two minutes, another orderly detachment appeared. In the hall outside the guest room door, they lined up in pairs and walked into the room on the lower side of the guest room. In Japanese parlance, this scene would probably be called a "demonstration."</p>
<p>After another three to five minutes, eight armed guards, marching in pairs, arrived outside the guest room door. They split to either side, four on each side, forming a wedge formation. Immediately following, an officer of the day on duty raised the bamboo curtain, entered the guest room, saluted Matsui and the others, and announced in a clear voice, "The Secretary-General of the Hebei-Chahar Political Council and Mayor of Beiping, representing the Chairman of the Political Council, will receive you esteemed guests." Having said that, he immediately turned back to the door, standing rigidly at attention. Only then did someone lift the curtain high, and from the hall came a sound of footsteps. Four armed figures, carrying large platters of food and drink, entered the guest room, spread them out on the large dining table, and then withdrew. The officer of the day at the door immediately invited the guests to take their seats. At this moment, Mr. Qin Dechun, in civilian clothes and carrying a folding fan, entered the room.</p>
<p>It was now a little after two o'clock in the afternoon. From this time until nearly six o'clock, Chief Qin calmly dealt with the unreasonable and domineering nonsense of Matsui, Imai, and the others, refuting them completely. In the end, this group of rascals had no choice but to resort to the last resort, like hoodlums in Beiping who, unable to win by fighting or cursing, simply smash their own noses, revealing their true rogue nature, roaring and gesticulating wildly:</p>
<p>"We are not here to debate with you, but to notify your superior, on the orders of the highest authority, that within twenty-four hours, all troops under your command must withdraw from Beiping, Nanyuan, Xiyuan, Wanping, Changxindian, Mentougou, and the area east of the Yongding River. This request must be obeyed whether you accept it or not!" Having said that, they threw the documents they had brought onto the ground. "These documents were prepared long ago, ready to kidnap your military and political leaders and force them to sign. Since the first two steps of the conspiracy have failed and no one has signed, we have no choice but to throw them on the ground."</p>
<p>Chief Qin, still smiling gently and elegantly, replied: "Chinese troops are stationed on Chinese soil, not in the capital of your esteemed country. What reason do you have to demand our withdrawal?"</p>
<p>(The person who saw this matter most clearly from beginning to end was the officer of the day. That officer of the day was an incarnation of Mr. W, who made a temporary cameo to strengthen security. It is said that there was a joke on the spot: one of the attendants who came with Matsui, whether due to congenital deficiency or acquired imbalance, or having indulged in too much wine and cold drinks, was too embarrassed to leave his seat because the debate on the stage was quite heated, so he had to urinate hot urine in his pants, perhaps in too large a quantity, inevitably creating a large puddle.)</p>
<p>Less than half an hour after Matsui and his party left, while the sun was still hanging over the Western Hills, casting a lingering glow of sunset, the Japanese troops on all fronts suddenly opened fire. As I was receiving and sending telegrams from various locations at our station, I heard the buzzing of a formation of aircraft coming from the northeast, which surprised me somewhat, because according to secret reports, the Japanese were not expected to launch a major offensive until dawn on the 28th. I immediately telegraphed headquarters, but headquarters said "don't know." I then telegraphed the Beiping branch, which said it was a probing operation, a large formation of aircraft, and was for reconnaissance and exercise purposes.</p>

<h3>Dollar Jumps, People Cry</h3>
<p>— Shao Fu</p>
<p>The American dollar has jumped greatly, breaking the four thousand yuan mark in the past two days. Judging by its trend, it seems that surpassing five thousand yuan is just a matter of time.</p>
<p>Those of us who worry every month upon receiving our new pay slips feel even more anxious upon hearing this news. The necessities of daily life will inevitably rise accordingly, so how are we to survive?</p>
<p>Some people are already analyzing the reasons for the dollar's soaring price. They say: first, the Central Bank has not settled foreign exchange for more than a week, foreign goods are piling up, and importers are panicking, so they are all rushing to the black market to scramble for spot goods; second, there are rumors that the official exchange rate of the legal tender against the US dollar will be adjusted again.</p>
<p>Others are saying: the above are all superficial reasons, the real reasons are (1) the situation is unstable, (2) the authorities have no solutions for the economy.</p>
<p>I am a layman when it comes to economic issues, but I believe that the above reasons, whether superficial or substantial, are not the real reasons. The real reason, in a nutshell, is speculation!</p>
<p>For example: first, the Central Bank is an institution that implements national financial policy. Since it can sell gold at any time to adjust market prices, there is no reason to deliberately not settle foreign exchange and allow the black market to soar; second, the rumors of adjusting the exchange rate have been solemnly denied by the authorities, and as Reuters reported on the 23rd: China is a signatory to the International Monetary Fund, and exchange rate adjustments are restricted and cannot be changed arbitrarily. "One-tenth" is the limit of devaluation, and a second adjustment cannot be made within six months; third, since the victory last year, the situation has been unstable for nearly a year, and it is not just these past two days; fourth, the economy has no solution, the overall situation is indeed bad. Superficially speaking, the price fluctuations in the past one or two months have not been drastic, and the government's issuance figures have not increased, so it cannot be said that the economic situation is particularly bad. Based on this, we really dare not believe that these reasons are driving the dollar's wild jump.</p>
<p>After thinking it over and over, it is still the speculators who are creating mysteries!</p>

<h3>American Marriage Problem Researcher's Opinion on Female Chastity</h3>
<p>— Xu Ying, translated from "Reader's Digest" September issue</p>
<p>Dr. Paul Popenoe, director of the American Rosencranz Family Relations Institute and author of the famous book "Modern Marriage," has conducted detailed research on the issue of premarital chastity for young women. His conclusion is: "Chastity is still the pride of women and an important factor in successful marriage. We are by no means being pedantic in discussing the issue of chastity, because modern psychology proves that chastity is completely in line with normal human nature." So, let us hear what he has to say:</p>
<p>Those Who Disregard Chastity</p>
<p>There is a school of thought that argues that women do not need to preserve their chastity before marriage, for the following reasons:</p>
<p>(1) If men and women can have further intimacy during their first love, it can enhance their friendship and enable them to understand each other better.</p>
<p>(2) The release of sexual desire is very important for psychological health. Suppression is harmful.</p>
<p>(3) Premarital physical intimacy can help women choose a suitable husband, rather than being purely emotional and wasting their lives.</p>
<p>(4) Women need practical sex education before marriage in order to adapt to sexual life after marriage.</p>
<p>Research Results</p>
<p>However, scientific research has proven that the above reasons are unfounded and harmful.</p>
<p>(1) Experience tells us that premarital physical intimacy not only cannot enhance friendship, but may even destroy it. When men and women combine emotionally, it is only a partial expression of true love, and it lacks a sense of emotional security.</p>
<p>(2) The harm of suppressing sexual desire was discovered by psychologist Sigmund Freud. He believed that sexual desire must be released to avoid damage to personality. However, we must note that he also solemnly stated on the other hand that if the spirit and body are not united and only physiological release is emphasized, then the danger is even greater than the suppression of sexual desire.</p>
<p>The experiment of premarital physical intimacy can never achieve the union of spirit and body. The desires of men and women are very limited, and they are only greedy for temporary physiological release. The psychological doubts and fears at the time are very harmful to both parties.</p>
<p>(3) Countless case studies have proven that premarital physical intimacy cannot help a woman choose a more suitable husband. On the contrary, she often chooses a worse husband or cannot choose a suitable partner for life.</p>
<p>The fact is that statistics tell us that ordinary men still prefer to marry virgins. Or some so-called "progressive" men may deny this view. However, we can imitate "Arabian Nights" and conduct an experiment: put a pair of equally beautiful twin girls in front of a man, let him choose one to be his wife, and then tell him that the one standing on the left is a virgin, while the one on the right is not. We believe that nine out of ten men will choose the virgin as his wife.</p>
<p>The idea that a woman, after satisfying her physiological needs and eliminating emotional influences, can choose her husband more calmly is completely unrealistic. Most women do not feel very strong physiological impulses before marriage, unless they are used to a dissolute life or excessively stimulate themselves. However, once sexual experimentation begins, sexual impulses will become more intense. Sometimes it may even lead to bad consequences. Therefore, in this situation, premarital loss of virginity does not help them choose a partner.</p>
<p>Should Not Be Indulged</p>
<p>(4) As for the claim that the sexual experience gained before marriage can be a preparation for achieving a happy marriage in the future, this is also denied by the research institute's findings. Feelings of shame or guilt, fear of being discovered by others, fear of pregnancy, fear of sexually transmitted diseases, and suspicion of the other party—all these unhealthy psychological states will obviously hinder a woman from adapting to her sexual life after marriage.</p>
<p>More seriously, girls who "have had things happen" are most likely to develop a sense of inferiority, so she desperately looks for someone to "liberate" herself. The more she fails, the more embarrassed she becomes. By then, it is very likely to cause mental abnormalities.</p>
<p>Even if she finds a partner, she always feels that there are many difficulties and cannot adapt to married life, because her new partner is completely different from the previous man, with different backgrounds, emotions, and education. Therefore, it is not easy for both parties to adjust their marital relationship. This is also one of the reasons why men like to marry virgins.</p>
<p>The most unfortunate thing is that once a habit of experimentation is formed, it is not easy to change. Therefore, many case studies tell us that women who have already had sexual experience before marriage are most likely to commit crimes after marriage.</p>
<p>The research institute's findings finally found that couples who have not had any sexual experience before marriage are most likely to achieve happy results after marriage and can adapt to their marital life happily.</p>
<p>Modern women should carefully consider their "lifelong events." They will always recognize that premarital chastity is still worth preserving. Even if some people think that premarital sexual relations may solve some problems, it may also create many serious and difficult to solve new problems. In short, everything is up to them to decide. A moment of difference can lead to eternal regret. Even women in the atomic age need to "think thrice before acting" on this issue!</p>
<h3>Can You Sympathize?</h3>

<p>Crossing the Garden Bridge on foot takes two minutes, by bicycle takes three minutes, and by tram takes five minutes.</p>

<h3>Human Talk</h3>
<p>— Mo Gao</p>
<p>If you are a human being, you are still a human being even naked; if you are not a human being, you are not a human being even if you wear silk and satin!</p>
<p>Humans have no boundaries or distinctions, but when they put on clothes, they have professions, grades, and differences between the rich and the poor.</p>
<p>Originally, people are good. However, for the sake of money and fame;</p>
<p>Some people sell their bodies,</p>
<p>Some people sell their consciences.</p>
<p>To see a person, you cannot look at their face.</p>
<p>To see a person, you cannot look at their clothing. The mistake in recognizing people is because you only look at their appearance.</p>
<p>The living are human beings, and the dead are also human beings. Only walking corpses are not human beings!</p>
<p>People can be divided into three types: one is to live oneself and hope that others also live; one is to live oneself and not hope that others live; and another is not to live oneself and tell others not to live either.</p>
<p>If you are human, you must live like a human being!</p>
<h3>A Respectable Figure</h3>
<p>— Lu Shixiong</p>
<p>Mr. Shu He Fu, the former dean of affairs and professor at Shanghai University, withdrew to his home country immediately after the outbreak of the August 13th Incident. After returning to the United States, he missed his colleagues who had worked together for many years on campus. Being in a war zone, their treatment was very meager, and their lives must be very difficult. However, he himself was willing but unable to do enough. Later, after thinking about it, he felt that the house he lived in was too big, so he moved from three rooms to another two, and remitted the rent money saved each month to Shanghai, entrusting a friend to give it to his colleagues on campus. After a few months, he felt that the money he remitted was too little, so he moved from two rooms to one room. After a few months, he moved from a large room to a smaller one. He moved three times in this way in order to save more money to help his colleagues until there was no smaller place to move to, only enough to accommodate himself. He said: He felt more comfortable and happier being able to save money to help his friends in the war than living in a tall building!</p>
<p>Mr. Shu's son served in the U.S. Air Force stationed in China. Before Japan surrendered, he was ordered to fly to Shanghai to bomb. He had been instructed by his father that there were many friends of his father in Shanghai, so he was particularly careful when bombing, and made sure to aim at military targets before taking action. When he flew over Shanghai University in Yangshupu, he circled several times, reluctant to leave for a long time. He said: He wished he could land next to Shanghai University to see what was going on on campus, but it was still occupied by the Japanese army at that time, and it was impossible to do so. He wrote to his father about the situation he had scouted in the air to relieve his old man's concern about the Shanghai University campus.</p>
<p>After the news of the Japanese surrender spread, Mr. Shu raised many old suits and leather shoes in the United States, packed them in boxes, and waited until Sino-American aviation resumed at the beginning of last winter. He shipped the first batch of clothes and shoes to Shanghai and gave them to his colleagues in the university to replace.</p>
<p>Several months ago, President Ling received a letter from Mr. Shu from the United States. The letter said roughly that Shanghai was his hometown and Shanghai University was like his sweet home. He really wanted to come back and asked President Ling whether he could allow such an old and weak person to return to the school to resume his duties and enjoy his remaining years. Otherwise, he would definitely come to Shanghai on his own to meet his old friends once again to fulfill his long-cherished wish.</p>
<p>Mr. Shu had served in the school for a long time. Many of the buildings on the Shanghai University campus were built by him. He was very conscientious, loyal and upright in his work. In the past, when he was in office, he would refuse to pay for any inappropriate use of funds, so he had the humorous nickname of "Mr. Shu the Tiger." At the same time, he inevitably aroused the jealousy of others, so some people asked the accountant to audit his accounts twice, but they did not find any malpractices. So, they were not only helpless against him, but also admired him for being honest and upright. Now, seeing his great compassion for helping his former colleagues, it is even more admirable!</p>
<p>Shanghai Dynamics</p>
<h3>Useless Mounted Patrol</h3>
<p>— Yuren</p>
<p>The Senate requested its abolition</p>
<p>The Senate has decided to abolish the police department's mounted patrol because the mounted patrol is an outdated police facility, which only wastes expenses and does not help in practice. Although Director Xuan sent a letter requesting "to maintain the status quo," most of the senators did not agree. From now on, "horse teams" will no longer be seen on the road.</p>
<p>The establishment of a mounted patrol in the Shanghai police agency began in the 33rd year of the Guangxu reign of the Qing Dynasty. At that time, Shanghai's security agency was the "General Bureau of Police," which was divided into four districts and nineteen sub-districts, as well as mounted patrols, water patrols, and fire brigades. Since then, the establishment of this mounted patrol has been adopted.</p>
<p>The concession's constabulary in this city also had established the "mounted patrol" long ago. According to the annual report of the "Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession" in 1930, the mounted patrol had four large horses and thirty-nine small horses. The monthly feeding cost for each horse was about thirty yuan. The inspectors in the mounted patrol were Westerners, and the patrol chiefs and patrolmen were entirely Indians. Those Indian constables, tall and slender, with bushy hair, riding high on horseback, were indeed quite "majestic."</p>
<p>In 1933 and 1934, there was only one Westerner and one Indian in the mounted patrol team of the Public Concession. Two people were also counted as a "mounted patrol team," which was incomprehensible. From this, we can also see the work situation of the "mounted patrol."</p>
<p>The author spent a lot of time looking through the Shanghai police data, trying to find some "merits" of the mounted patrol, but I am sorry to say that, apart from occasionally showing off during large funerals and suppressing or dispersing crowds, other merits could not be found.</p>
<p>To be honest, the mounted patrol was superfluous even in the past. The Chinese are always accustomed to following old ways and let this outdated facility remain in modern cities. Now that it has been decided to abolish it, the mounted patrol can only "die in bed," and it lived for thirty-eight years.</p>
<h3>Sermon</h3>
<p>— ww</p>
<p>Due to the "monk's petition" and the disagreement with lay people, I have a few more words to say. Freedom of religion is a general principle, and there is no distinction between each other; I also heard my elders talk about Buddhism when I was young, and my heart was moved by it. When I grew up, I saw the "Guanshiyin" movie, and my heart was greatly moved, so I wrote to Yuan Chen for instructions. The Master advised me to serve the society more, to be selfless, which is to believe in Buddhism. We can discuss it again on another day (probably referring to old age). Yuan Chen's words are exactly what I want. I admire his vision, recognize it clearly, and it is not common these days. The heart is the Buddha, why bother with smoke in form? Water and land rituals, incense candles, - how does it benefit my heart? I think there is a great need for reform. For example, Christianity is more progressive than the old religion. We need happiness, vitality, energy, and light, and I don't want to step into dark temples. I only enjoy listening to lectures, and I even advocate moving temples outside the city, so that you can calm down and then cultivate your heart.</p>

<h3>Sanmao Joins the Army (109)</h3>

<p>News Figure</p>
<h3>About Liang Shuming</h3>
<p>— Gan Lai</p>
<p>Recently, there have been rumors that Liang Shuming, Secretary-General of the Democratic League, will resign. Liang himself stated in person when he met with reporters in the capital on the 18th: "Resignation is planned, not sudden. When I accepted the position, I set a three-month term." Unexpectedly, Liang came to Shanghai on the third day and, after meeting with several leaders of the Democratic League, decided to "temporarily not resign." In this, we don't need to make wild guesses.</p>
<p>Liang is a famous scholar. His poems and prose are fluent and can be recited. Some even compare his writing to Liang Rengong's "Yinbingshi Wenji" for its briskness and vividness. He is the author of several books, including "An Outline of Indian Philosophy," "Eastern and Western Cultures and Their Philosophy," "Liang Shuming's Essays Before Thirty," and "Liang Shuming's Essays After Thirty." Among them, the two essays on literary history occupy a high value in academics.</p>
<p>Philosophy Professor</p>
<p>He is from Guilin, Guangxi. After graduating from the Zhili Public Law and Politics School, he served as secretary of the Ministry of Justice and professor of Indian philosophy at Peking University. During the Northern Expedition, he served as director of the secretarial office under the command of Li Jishen, the leader of the Gui faction. At that time, Liang was only twenty-five years old, which can be said to be a success in his youth. Soon, he was appointed as a member of the Guangzhou Political Branch of the Kuomintang and a member of the Guangdong Provincial Government. Later, he served as the principal of the First Middle School of Guangdong Province. The school was serious in teaching and well-managed, and it was the best middle school in the province.</p>
<p>When Liang was young, he had a short beard, wore outdated glasses, and wore simple clothes. He did not like to dress up. He looked like he was forty or fifty years old. The unrestrained attitude was just like the identity of a scholar.</p>
<p>Entertaining himself with poetry and prose Li's political failure, the dye also Shao light self-defeating, closed the door quietly, to poetry and prose. After that, he was hired by "Han Qingtian" (Fu Ju) to go to Shandong to establish and implement a model village plan. Because Han only had a reputation for being courteous to scholars, but his actual knowledge was shallow and his ideas were stubborn, it was not easy to get along between the guest and the host, and Liang felt very depressed.</p>
<p>During the Anti-Japanese War, Liang once served as the chairman of the Shandong Provincial Party and Government Committee. He was almost entirely responsible for all provincial government affairs and public training matters because the provincial chairman Shen Honglie was in charge of military affairs that day and could not take care of other matters.</p>
<p>Currently, Liang is fifty-four years old and is now a standing committee member and secretary-general of the Democratic League, becoming a mainstay of the political party. In the past, he succeeded in his youth, but now he should be called: "Old but vigorous."</p>
