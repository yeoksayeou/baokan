<h3 id="c34">從世界看遠東 <a href="#c34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>四國外長會議與聯合國大會的相繼圓滿閉幕，在國際上不僅使擾攘不安的一九四六年獲得一個平靜的歸趨；而且也使一九四七年的國際政治展開一慕美妙的遠景。從此人類更可以相信，目前離開其日夜所渴望的和平，雖然還十分遙遠，但是這個人類共同的願望，終有實現的一天。所以世界各國的政治外交家於聖誕節向各該國人民所發表的演說，對於明日之世界，莫不表示樂觀與愉快。聖誕老人帶來了和平的福音，實令人感奮，就是在戰災各國的人民，也感覺到無限的溫暖。</p>
<p>但是從世界局勢看到遠東的情形，一重妻凉的陰影，突然投射在每一個人的心頭；遠東可以說是世界政治中最脆弱的一環了；在世界沒有發生戰亂之　，早就在烽火蔓延之中；到了世界各國均能和平相處之後，遠東的烽火還沒有熄滅的希望。中國國內的戰亂不必說，印度尼西亞首先揭起民族解放的大　，與荷蘭駐軍從事殊死的鬥爭，流血己逾年餘，迄今僅成立了一種印荷協定的草的，尙未獲得雙方的批准。其次是越南，在維明共和政府總統胡志明的領導之下，本欲以和平諒解的方法，達成越南的獨立自主，他爲了要達到此項目的，曾親自前往巴黎，與法國當局締結法越條約，以促進法越的關係，而謀雙方的幸福；無如法國駐越南高級專員達香里歐海軍中將，始終未脫過去法國對待越南人民的態度，以致激起越南人民的憤怒，乃造成目前擾摟不安的局面。現在法國正値社會黨領袖勃魯姆秉政，對於越南所當採取的政策與態度，自有改變的可能，否則越南局勢必將每况愈下，不知要造成何種可悲的局面！再决爲印度緬甸，英國工黨內閣雖於本年初宣佈印度的獨立，最近艾德禮首相又宣佈緬甸的獨立，但是在印度的內部發生了印回之爭，回敎聯盟始終堅持着印回分治之主張，拒不參加印度臨時政府，對於印度制憲會議，也採取旁觀的態度，英國雖欲從中拉攏，但是倫敦英印回三方面的圓桌會議，仍未能獲得任何成就。回教從在印度各處，採取破壞行動，使印度陷於恐怖狀態，雖經印度聖雄甘地以絕食死諫，也沒有獲得成效。至於緬甸，離開眞正的獨立，還有一段漫長的距離。</p>
<p>亞洲的實際情况旣如上述，列强在亞洲的關係，猶未完全明朗。尤其是美蘇兩國對於遠東問題所當採取的立場，尚在明暗不定的狀態之下。美蘇兩國對於若干世界問題，旣能互相諒解，照理對於遠東問題，也是不難成立妥協約。但是實際的情形如何？殆難斷言。例如日本賠償問題，美蘇的意見不當會南轅北轍，如何折衷成立妥協，實在是一個非常困灘的問題。何况蘇聯朝野，對於美國管制日本的政策，始終表示不滿。其次是朝野的統一問題，美蘇兩佔領區實行合併，實在也是刻不容緩的事情，否則朝鮮被人爲的因素，肢解爲兩部份，不僅血液不能通暢，而且深度割裂的痛苦，當然談不到復興的間題。再决是我國的東北問題。蘇聯搬運了這末許多的工業設備，在蘇聯言，稱此爲戰利品，由其搬走的理由，十分充足；但在美國而論，則認爲此非戰利品，而應將此作爲日本賠償之用。雙方各執一詞，至今尚未獲得結論。最近忽雙發生了大連的事件，美國輿論界對此，雖然十分重視；但美國當局爲避免美蘇關係惡化起見，乃表示淡然處之，並希望由中蘇兩國直接進行談判解决，美國國務院能顧全大局，不從小處着眼，實在是一種賢明的辦法。但是在蘇聯當局對於美國，却仍斤斤較量，例如蘇聯僑民與美國憲兵數月前在上海發生的衝突事件，本來是一件非常瑣碎的事情，但是蘇聯外交當局，却小題大做，竟由蘇聯駐美大使向美國國務院提出抗議，使我們終覺蘇聯當局對於美蘇關係好轉的時機，並不十分珍惜，不能不引爲遺憾。</p>
<p>要之，從世界看到遠東，目下遠東雖然還在黎明之前，但是人類是進步的。尤其在第二次大戰之後，其進步必更加迅速，越南與束印的烽火，即足以證明帝國主義的時代業己終了。同時從各種因素看來，尤其是杜魯門總統最近發表的對華宜言，重言聲明，去年十二月十五日所發表的對華宣言，繼續有效，實令人相信，遠東局勢也有隨着世界大局好轉而開期的希望。</p>

<p>〔本報廣州訊〕傳聞已久之廣東五年建設計劃，經記者多方探詢，已略悉其大概。查該計劃係由羅主席卓英於年初決定，派省委黃文山為五年計劃起草委員會主委，李揚敬·謝文龍·杜梅和·兵　·姚賓猷·羅香林的為常委，聘請專家學者及各主管負責者九十餘人任起草委員，省內知名之士咸應聘參加集體創作，草定各門類建設計劃，並以省設計考核會副主委賴希如為主編，梁謙武為副主編，費時幾六月，四易其稿，並曾提省行政會議及省參議會研討，全部計劃不日可公佈，內容分經濟文化政治三大部門，二十四類，八十二項。</p>
<p>經濟</p>
<p>經濟建設門，以奠定工業化基礎及解決民主食衣之足給為中心，綜計建設公營工廠五十餘所，農塲九十餘所，漁塲四十餘所，礦塲二十餘所，發電動力三十餘站，水利工程四十餘處，最後一年效益可達足供全省人民減少全省糧食缺額百分之四十，衣料百分之三十。</p>
<p>文化</p>
<p>文化門以掃除全省文盲，培養職業專門人才為中心，綜計建設國民學校四三九六八所，職業學校三二所，師範學校一〇三所，中學校一〇三所，專科學校五所，培養留學生一〇〇名，最後一年效益可掃除全省文盲百分之八十，儲備建設人才百分之六十</p>
<p>政治</p>
<p>政治門以實施地方自治鞏固憲政基礎為中心，計分基層建設，警政建設，財政建設，地政建設，衛生建設，社會建設，合作事業，市政建設等專章，以期樹立現代政治之規模。據該會負責人談，該計劃係根據中央國策，及中央設計局物資及文化建設計劃原則，並參考蘇聯五年計劃與美國TVA制度，及本省實際情形而草定，每項事業設計，對於過去概況，中心業務分年進度，預期效益，所需資金及人才等均詳為規劃。</p>
<p>資金</p>
<p>其資金額定為戰前幣值六億元，籌集方法，另有方案，聞正呈中央核示中。就記者觀察，廣東為政治安定之區，且經濟資金向極活躍，苟能運用僑資，吸收游資，循此堅定而行，則他日建設之成就，不僅可使革命策源地之廣東進入建設之新階段，抑且將大有裨於建國前途也。</p>

<p>大會堂裏代表見面盡是歸去聲，不外是什麽工具，什麽時日，還有的是離別之宴的繁多，真的此一別又得一年，明年今日再圖聚首一堂，無限別情不勝依依。這是大會歡樂之中的一點離愁。</p>
<p>開會前有人在招呼：「凡是民國廿年參加過國民會議，現在參加國民大會的同仁，請注意從前我們是制定約法，今天我們是完成了憲法，希望同仁們於會散後集合起來攝影留念」。</p>
<p>中華民國憲草從今天開始，換了一個字，正式的合了「法」一部憲法用錦面裝訂，並在封面貼紅緞一條，上燙「中華民國憲法」六個金字，字體是按照國父遺墨三度放大而成，這是珍貴而又珍貴的。</p>
<p>憲法是今天上午方三　通過，但是下午就由大會交出來了，交出時全部條文都已繕就，據說這是一為無名英雄葉毅一手所成，葉毅是國大的秘書，為了這部憲法，曾經幾個通夜未眠，但是他的墨跡終於成了歷史上不朽的文件。</p>
<p>這部憲法放在特製的木架上，木架上漆有國旗一面，下署國民大會四字，放在主席台上，並圍以彩綢，登台一覩者絡繹不絕，攝影記者成隊而來，用各種方式各種角度來攝取他們的藝術寫真。</p>
<p>開會前吳稚老與主席蒞臨，是吳在前，主席在後，散會時主席仍讓吳氏在前，但吳氏一再謙讓，結果主席笑容滿面先一步而出。</p>
<p>洪秘書長與吳文官長上台舉行接交典禮時，洪在前，吳在後，下來時彼此謙讓，吳居先，洪隨後，這些都是有意義的鏡頭。</p>
<p>蔣主席致詞時，全體代表始終總是情緒提得非常高，所以轟雷似的掌聲隨時都爆發在會堂裏，最後中華民國萬歲的聲浪不絕於耳。</p>
<p>會塲中最忙碌的，是簽名，新聞記者，大會職員，以及代表，都忙着找人簽名，尤其于髯公，真是筆不停揮。</p>
<p>國大之后本屆任期完畢，皇冠將要取下重作布衣矣。</p>
<p>大會堂門前拍照生意好，每次開會前後，總是成羣成隊的在那兒拍團體照。今日雖下雨，仍然不得休息。據談大會預備給代表們拍全體照，只是地點難見，最後決定是陵園，但是天不作美，下雨天拍不成，明天起又將紛作歸計，大半是拍不成了。</p>
<p>代表們最後的點心，是梅蘭芳的戲，今晚已在勵志社上演，明天起在大華，代表們眼福不淺。</p>

<p>〔聯合社巴黎廿六日電〕法國殖民部長慕臺今日在越南實地調查聲中，越南渤已在北部安南與東京兩省作扇形推展，越盟軍隊仍堅強抵抗。</p>
<p>〔合眾社巴黎廿五日電〕據河內法國參謀總部最近發表之公報稱：法軍完全控制之地點，僅維明政府首都所在地，越盟軍仍在周圍各區頑抗。該公報稱：「該城中心情形安謐掃蕩戰業已開始」。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社西貢廿五日電〕法軍參謀部頃發表公報，宣布法軍在越南續有進展。略稱，法軍業已將河內之安南人聚居地區加以包圍，刻正進行掃蕩工作，越軍抵抗仍極活動，但法軍仍不斷向公墓方面挺進。另有法軍一隊自河內出發，已於今晨進抵巴克寗，現正繼續向福麥松前進。此在南定方面，越軍仍日夜攻擊火車站，在越軍屍體一具，及日士兵屍體數具，越軍損失雖重，但仍以極大人數發動軍事行動，海塘鐵僑已為越軍所毀。法國援軍一批已自海防開抵海塘，海防郊外刻正遭越軍迫擊砲猛烈轟襲，諒山與大延兩地法軍現已取得連絡，越軍三千五百人於本月十九日進襲順化，常被法軍擊潰。</p>
<p>〔聯合社巴黎廿五日電〕法國今日發動加強其在越南方面之政治及軍事前綫。法國降落傘部隊第一旅已自北非乘巡洋艦「杜格斯納」號開往越南。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社西貢廿六日電〕法國海外殖民部長慕臺昨夜自加爾各答飛抵此間，法駐越高級軍政長官皆在機場歡迎。慕臺答覆記者之詢問，僅謂，余此行乃欲實地視察，不欲多言，且在越南勾留之期甚暫，約於一月十六日即擬回返法國。余此行徵得國會之完全同意，吾人保衛法國人民與友邦人士之政策并不變更云。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社西貢廿五日電〕法國海外殖民部長慕臺抵此之後，此間頓時大為震動，與明政府逃逸時之情形初無二致。政治觀察家咸認為慕臺部長與法駐越高級專員達香禮歐同在西貢，足證法政府願與維明政府獲致協議。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社開羅廿五日〕法國遠東軍司令勒克萊將軍前往越南視察，昨夜道出此間，略事休息後，即前往加爾各答。又據路透社訊：勒格萊行前曾獲如下之訓令：（一）研究軍事局勢；（二）研究衝突原因，及恢復和平之方法；（三）估計需要之增援總隊；（四）將研究所得向海外殖民部長慕臺報告該報復稱，法當局擬再調二萬人增防越南，擬由法郵「法蘭西島一號及前航空母艦「貝恩」號運輸。</p>
<p>〔聯合社西貢二十五日電〕法國駐越南高級專員達琴禮歐今日向此間法國居民發表廣播演說，其內容略謂法國不致允應越南人民完全獨立之要求。獨立無異一種神話，對於法國及越南之利益，俱有嚴重損害，惟法國允履行地方自治協定。若於越南人民進化之現階段，即準予無條件完全獨立，實非雙方之福。</p>

<p>〔本報南京廿六日電〕週來越南局勢因法軍武力行動，引起越盟政府之抗戰後，日驟惡化。我在越僑胞生命財產大受損害，彼等已向外部提出請求，請與法越雙方交涉，於海防河內等華僑集中城市劃定「中立區」，聞我外交當局對此議，正予考慮中。</p>
<p>又甫於二十日恢復之中法關於越南問題協定實施之談判，日來又告停頓，蓋現下混亂之越南局勢，亟須前往越南實地考察後方可決定之數問題，如海防自由區之劃定·滇越聯運辦法之設計·與賠償物資設備之估值等，均無法進行。惟刻仍留京之法代表團與我方各負責談判人員，均一致盼望法越問之癥結，能迅速覓得解決途徑，使越南局勢可恢復安謐，俾此項談判得早日獲得結果。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社河內廿五日電〕法越兩國軍隊日來發生衝突，華僑罹難者截至目前為止，僅有一人之身份業已查明，華僑財產損失為數頗少。但在歐僑區內，華僑之生命財產均未受損失，法國軍隊現正在華僑地區與越人地區之交界處，中國駐越南總領事昨日曾進入該地區與越人及華僑接觸，俾能劃定一中立區，但於今晨宣稱，此行任務已遭失敗，渠將賡續努力，務使此項計劃得以實現。此外又據法官方人士談稱，北圻法軍決司令莫里愛將軍業已同意設立中立區。</p>

<p>〔法國新聞社巴黎廿六日電〕法國境內越南共和國軍民為越南事件而舉行示威遊行，情緒激昂。土倫斯，波爾多，穆林，瑪桑康特，蒙特呂貢及里昂等地，皆有示威遊行隊伍。　數自一千五百人至二百人不等。口呼「法軍不再駐在越南」「尊重法越協定」「法越友誼萬歲」等口號，并要求立即停止越南共和國境內之戰事，否則將實行絕食云。</p>

<p>〔法國新聞社巴黎廿五日電〕頃據官方公報宣佈：法國海外殖民部長慕臺出國期間由國務部長勞倫暫代。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社紐約廿六日電〕「紐約通報」頃評述法蘭西第四共和國在艱苦情形下得以成立一事，認為值得加以重視。并申述其理由如次：內政方面，首宜加以注意者，乃未能組成真正代表各方面之政府，而由社會業單獨組閣。該黨在國民會議之人數，僅佔六分之一而已。其次為財政上之困難，目前頗使法國感覺窘迫。其三為戰後元氣尚未完全恢復。以言國際情形，法國外交政策在東方與西方之間，亦使其舉棋不定。政府之長期不穩；對於此種困難，不能緩和。以越南事件而論，法國於應付不暇之時，尚需從事殖民地戰爭，實使困難益增。但以法國人道精神深堪一點而論，前途尚許樂觀。</p>

<p>〔法國新聞社新德里廿六日電〕此間今日宣布：亞洲國際會議定於明年三月廿四日在此間開幕，至四月三日閉幕。請柬已向卅二國發出，但尚未接獲答覆，亦無一國表示不能參加。非亞洲國家中，僅埃及一國被邀參加。會議殆將由印度臨時政府副主席尼赫魯揭幕。籌備委會主席奈都夫人現已在佈置一切。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社倫敦廿五日電〕關於亞洲各國人民將在德里舉行會議一事，頃由無黨派雜誌「時潮」加以評論稱：印度時時政府副主席尼赫魯最近所採取之政治手腕，其目的乃在發動其自身之泛亞洲運動，尼赫魯之計劃，具有超宗教與超種族之性質，其目的乃在組織共同的亞洲陣綫，對對付西方各國之剝削。以視日本之「大東亞」觀念，實迥然相異。該項計劃係真正的泛亞洲，其範圍至為博大，東至日本神道教徒，西至黎巴嫩基督教徒，均將包括在內。其所持觀點，頗為樂觀，認為亞洲所有人民，均能以博愛與諒解之心，携手合作。尼赫魯之計劃，一如其人所持觀念，實極為偉大。但尼赫魯是否認為泛亞洲聯邦能容忍巴基斯坦之存在，回教聯盟領袖真納念及泛亞洲聯邦將由印度教徒，為其領袖是否願意亞洲統一，凡此種種皆屬疑問云。真納認為尼赫魯一日為印度政府首長，回教即一日處於危險之中，耶路撒冷大主教對此，亦深以為然。</p>

<p>〔聯合社倫敦廿五日電〕英國駐西班牙大使馬萊奉召回國，今日篛飛機抵此。聯合國大會在紐約通過決議，由會員各國召回駐西使節，以未不贊成弗朗哥政府，馬萊係聯合國被召回大使之第一人。</p>
<p>〔路透社馬德里廿六日電〕英大使馬萊已於今日啟程返國，馬德里報紙於日前發表使馬萊感覺不安之消息，指此間英大使館曾積極參加反弗朗哥運動，其實此間之英大使館於從事例有之社交活動時，雖曾與西班牙之各派人土接觸，惟就英記者所知，西班牙之反弗朗哥人士，仍以英美大使館，未敢積極同情彼等而不滿。西班牙之各反弗朗哥派，一年來其內部關係并未趨於好轉，迨英美法於三月四日發表宣言，表示希望弗朗哥政府自動下野，設立臨時政府以舉行普選，更使反弗朗哥派中之保王派大為憤怒。至七月八月間，各反弗朗哥派間之一致行動談判，幾已完全陷於停頓，而各派對於西班牙未來政府之形式，至今猶不能成立協議。至九月間，共黨即放棄與各派之合作而決定採取斷然之共和主義，於是西班牙之各反弗朗哥派，乃益形分散矣。</p>
<h3 id="c76">戰後一大課題　日軍民遣返工作 <a href="#c76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>中國本部的三百萬人，已經遣送完畢。此外尚有一百萬人，原業是在東北方面的。由於國慰局勢的複雜，此輩日人之命運如何，尚在未定之天。</p>
<p>將數百萬日本俘虜及僑民自中國遣返日本，確實是一椿龐大和困難的工作，但是在中美雙方合作之下，大體上可以說已經「功德圓滿」了。</p>
<p>在日皇宣認無條件投降詔書，日軍放下武器那一天，也就是世界大戰和中日戰爭正式結束的那一天，在華日軍和日僑共有四百萬人，但是經過一年的努力之後，已經有三百萬人重島國了。所餘的一百萬人，原來是在滿洲（東九省）方面的。由於蘇聯政策深奧莫測，這一百萬人的遣返，一時還無從解決，美國方面也有無能為力之慨。</p>
<p>「世界報告週刊」特派員朗恩茲最近從上海發出一個報告，把日本軍民遣返工作的內情，說得很清楚，現在把其中的要點，　譯在後面。</p>
<p>遣返日本軍民的工作，是由中美合作在去年十二月間開始的，其方法，是先將他們有系統地解除武裝，并且逐步集中在一起。但是中國面積遼闊，日本軍民分佈極廣，所以不得不分區進行。當時決定道德處理華南。臺灣和越南方面，在三個多月的時間內，總共遣返日人六十萬人以上。其次是華中方面，總共遣返八十萬人以上。最後是華北，總共遣返五十五萬四千人左右，後者在最近始告完成。</p>
<p>在時行遣返工作的時候，對於日本僑民究竟深入中國達何程度的問題，獲得了一個頗可注目的結論：就是日軍和日僑的比例，是三與二。換言之，每遣返日本士兵三人，就遣返平民二人。日本軍兵遣返工作的進行，對於日本本身的影響，是兩重性的：一方面是一種普遍的慰藉之感，覺得分散在各地的國民終於回去了；另一方面，在經濟上卻引起了種種憂慮。</p>
<p>從好的方面講，許多家庭從此得以團聚了，多餘的人力可以應用到生產工作上去，政府在起草復興計劃的時候，也不致茫無所措了。這一點，使美國的威信提高了不少，因為美國和蘇聯不同，頗能恪守波茨坦宣言中所規定的責任。</p>
<p>但是在壞的方面講，遣返日本軍民的費用，大部份須由日本政府負担，這筆開支是相當浩大的。同時，在戰後日本支離破散的經濟機構中，要容納如許返國的軍民，也實在是一件棘手的事情。更有進者，糧食和住屋問題，也就更其嚴重起來了。可是壞的方面不論怎樣壞，日本人對於遣返工作的迅速進行，還是覺得值得的。所以不論支出如何浩大，還是希望從速把滿洲方面一百萬日本軍民，送回到本國來。可是這一件事比較複雜，因為有蘇聯牽入在內。</p>
<p>日本軍民自美軍控制區的迅速遣返，使日本人對於蘇聯的措施感覺不滿，這可以從日本人最近在東京蘇聯駐日大使館前舉行示威，要求加速遣返工作一點見之。蘇聯一向對於日本極為注意，并就共產主義的榮耀和蘇聯對日本人民的關懷大事宣傳，可是遣返工作的波折疊起，對於日本共產黨和蘇聯代表團的工作，顯然是一大打擊。</p>
<p>經過了許多次折衝之後，蘇聯最後已決定，每月自西比利亞東部一港遣返日人一萬至一萬五千名，（最近報載麥帥和蘇聯當局已成立每月遣返五萬人的協定—譯者），但是日本人還不能感到十分滿意，因為美國自中國大陸遣返日人時，工作的最高峰每日遣返者曾達一萬二千人之多呢。</p>
<p>還有一點使日本人不滿的，就是蘇聯準備先遣送日本平民，儘量延遲日俘的遣返工作。據各方估計，日軍之在蘇聯手中者，至少有八十萬人。美國方面認為其中有七十萬人。美國方面認為其中有七十萬人已從滿州運往西比利亞，在勞工營中工作，日本人認為這一點違背波茨坦宣言。同時照目前的辦法進行，遣送一百萬人至少需要幾年的時間。</p>
<p>今後的發展如何，當然不是任何人所能推測，因為局勢是隨時可能發生變化的。但是有一點卻非常值得重視，就是中國本部日本軍民的遣返工作，已告完成。東京方面一向稱之「中日事變」的戰爭，經過冗長的九個年頭之後，總算正正式式地結束了。（亞農譯自「世界報告週刊」）</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕昨日午後三時半，中國航空公司醫務主任荷愛醫師（C.F.Hoey）曾赴中山醫院探視從該公司兩架失事機中、所救出之受傷旅客。中國航空公司於前晚出事後，迄昨晨止，曾先後送達傷者三批，共十五人。第一批七人：兪鵬（重傷），趙繼興（男），腎裂傷，小便出血，頭顱骨折，在昏迷中。劉騰驤（男）腦震傷，陳阿二（男）右腿斷，張琦雲（女）傷頭部及左腿，閔婉貞（女）傷頭部及膝部，無名氏（女）送院至今，一直在昏迷狀態中。第二批四名：張椿華（男）左足脛腓骨斷，吳榮炳（男）左手尺骨折斷，薛錦帆（男）傷臂部，比較殺輕，潑勞士（Preus,男，即一一五號機正駕駛員）頭面部重傷，在昏迷狀熊中。又無名小孩二名，其一已於昨晚六時五十分死亡，不足週歲。另一兩腿折斷，約一歲餘。第三批兩人：王孝德（男，係一一五號機無綫電員）膝部關節脫位，股骨脛腓骨共折四段，腦裂傷，病情甚重，徐維龍（男）頭面部傷。</p>
<p>前述十五名傷者中，兪鵬業於昨晨不治身死。無名氏女性及王孝德延至昨晚。亦因傷重，已入彌留狀態。餘尙佳。其中尤以第一一五號機中之搭客張椿華及薛錦帆二人，受傷最輕。猶能獲得醫師之允許，與記者作片刻之談話。</p>
<p>張椿華爲唱武丑之平劇藝員，僅右耳及左跟略受傷，現住二樓某號二等病房中。其時適有周姓女友一人，正在股股慰問。張在漢口大舞台與李少春同台演唱，至十六日期滿。原可與李同時返滬，因舞台方面尚有包銀未克如期付張，太延至二十五日方獲啓程。原擬抵滬後略事休息，立即轉往天津演唱，豈料適逢失事。</p>
<p>據張吿：飛機抵滬上空，的在七時左右，彼適在睡鄉中。迨在極度衝撞中震醒，飛機業已出事。張從昏迷狀熊中醒來，猶未知已受傷，待欲起立，方發覺左腿已折傷，輾轉反則於機旁，迄午夜以後，方有人來救護。</p>
<p>薛錦帆爲百貨商，自渝來滬辦貨，同行共有夥伴六人，僅薛一人獲倖免。薛坐於中部機位上，僅知無法降落，初不料有他。迨最後飛機突然墮落，即吿昏迷。醒來時，見已被拋出機外，躺於河灘上。旁有婦人一名，薛本人類相助之良能，尙圖上前救助，豈知竟係一死屍。是時乃恍然覺悟自身亦已受傷，力疲倒地。救入醫院後，經過情形甚佳，親友等已數往探視。</p>
<p>第一一五號機美籍駕駛員潑勞士傷勢頗重。中航公司荷愛醫師入室探視時，仍不能言語。頭部臉頰等處均紥有紗布綢帶。左腿骨折斷。荷愛醫師當囑咐院中醫師，將潑勞士換入最佳病房，僱一特別護士，必要時不斷輸血，用X光檢查胸腹內部有無傷處。並稱：醫藥費絕無問題，一切當由中航公司照付。若潑勞士卒能獲救，殆將爲失事三客機中唯一得救之機師矣。</p>

<p>中國航空公司於昨日發表此次失事原由之公吿如下：</p>
<p>前晚（十二月廿五日）中國航空公司損失自渝飛滬客機兩架，實屬深可驚悼，第一四〇號C-47式機，由飛機師J.M.Greenwood駕駛，副飛機師劉林森飛行，報務員金鏗隨行，上午十時十五分自重慶珊瑚壩起飛，沿途應經停武昌·南京。又第一一五號C-46機，由飛機師R.B.Preus駕駛，副飛機師譚興錚飛行，報務員王孝德隨行，上午十時卅分自重慶白市驛起飛，沿途經停武昌，即直飛上海，兩機午後離開武昌，間隔的十五分鐘先後續飛，當時</p>
<p>京滬兩地氣候均尙適於飛機降落，洎至飛近南京時，京滬兩處氣候均陡生變化，因武昌機塲缺乏夜航設備，時巳不容飛回，而京滬兩處機塲均有夜航設備可供夜晚降落，尤其江灣飛機塲，具有盲目降落及夜航設備更較完善，本應經停南京之第一四〇號機即試圖在京降落，但以氣候關係，該處機塲全不能見，該飛機師遂續飛上海，第一一五號飛機抵達滬空的在下午五時卅分，第一四〇號飛機抵達時的後此一小時，其時滬地氣候與南京亦復相同，第</p>
<p>一四〇號飛機首先試圖在江　機場利用盲目降落設備着陸，該飛機師在該處上空盤旋的一小時餘，幾經試騐因飛機上無綫電儀器部份失靈，終無法利用此種盲目降落，雖能與指揮塔通訊，但因電力太弱，不能與盲目降落設備發生聯絡，又復續試一小時餘，確知降落江灣爲不可能，除飛往龍華外，更無他途，及試岡在龍華機塲降落，能見度仍等於零，數次嘗試，終遂通知指揮塔因機上汽油已罄，惟有强迫降落，在試行降落中於矯正着陸方向之際，撞毀於機塲西南端，時爲七時五十五分。至於第</p>
<p>一一五號飛機在江灣上空盤旋，已能與盲目降落設備聯絡，但有時不甚淸晰，在此等情形之下，降落亦難期安全，遂於九時許飛離江灣至龍華機塲，此時天氣略有變化，能見度漸次淸晰，經屢次試圖降落，其最後一次嘗試已幾於成功，僅須再繞一週改變方向，不意正在此際，竟爾隊毀於機塲外西南一英里黃家渡河廟塔，其原因尙未盡明瞭。該第一一五號飛機盤旋江灣上空的經三小時又卅分，前兩小時內空中尙有第一四〇號機及另一架中國航空公司飛機。</p>
<p>第一四七號</p>
<p>又其他部份飛機兩架，中國航空公司之第一四七號機已於七時四十分在江灣機塲安全降落，當一四〇號飛機在龍華試岡降落之際，中國航空公司主管及機航部份人員，均在塲守候，本塲消防隊救護車醫護人等亦均召集聽用，並經報吿市府警局派有警察及消防隊蒞塲，以備萬一，故失事時得及時救助。至於第一一五號機則於失却聯絡後一小時許始得失事之消息，其時美軍及美海軍均協助搜尋，水上警察及美海軍均派出船艇多隻。</p>
<p>沿江偵察</p>
<p>計第一四〇號機載客二十七人，機員三人。第一一五號機載客三十三人，機員三人，受傷者均已送入醫院，不幸死亡爲數頗重，乘客姓名及其他詳細情形，當探明續爲披露。</p>

<p>萬國殯儀館裏，死者靜靜躺着，有不少屍身上已堆滿了鮮花。在中國殯儀館，情形就不同了，整堆的屍身績在一起，血·泥·雨水·把衣服染得己經難以辨認。無窮悲悼的家屬們，有時祗能從一只高跟鞋上追認出自己親屬的面目！哭聲震地，慘不忍睹。</p>
<p>中央機罷難者夏昌鈎，是糧食邵專員，與其妻夏吳淑貞同時遇難。夏昌鈞死狀尤慘，一足已斷。前糧政特派員楊錫志昨天曾親自往認。夏夫人的親屬者見遺骸，痛哭暈厥！夏氏夫婦還是本年五月結婚的，不想未滿一年，竟成同命鴛鴦！中央機副機師劉林森，也在失事時殞生，而他也祗訂婚了兩個月，昨天劉的未婚妻曾去認屍，更是悽絕人寰！</p>
<p>此次瀋陽國大代表遼寗人趙某之夫人趙老太太，即趙王玉賢，偕其公子趙繼興，由渝乘機赴京探望　代表，因氣候變化，改飛上海，不意亦遭此刧，母子同命。趙氏次公子仲興，已到萬國殯儀館辨認屍號，料理喪務，並已急電促南京趙代表來滬。</p>
<p>萬國殯儀當　，有一個人認出了一位死者是他的親戚張琦雲，但是，在中山醫院六號室三十號病牀上，張綺雲正安心躺着。她還能說話，她說，她的確是張琦雲。後來知道是誤會的。</p>
<p>美軍憲兵MP前夜在風雨中駕駛吉普車急速把傷者送醫院時，不想車行過急，路上掩傷行人李陳氏一名，撞傷頭部，結果連失事傷者一同送到了中山醫院。</p>
<p>在中山醫院，有一位罹難者的身邊，找到了兩張飛機票，一張的姓名是兪鵬，另一張的姓名是張枕江，以致姓名無從確定。</p>
<p>在中航機一一五號殘骸旁邊，救護員檢起了一個穿花布衣的小弟弟，謝天謝地，他竟一點沒有受傷！記者到達中山醫院時，他已經安然送抵院中，睡着了。他自己言說，名字呌王弟弟，今年四歲。他的家長是誰，他是從那裏來的，現在都無法知道。在聖誕前夕，他也許還是一個受盡寵愛的快快樂樂的小天使——現在，却已成為飄零天涯的一個孤兒！</p>

<p>又訊，赤金下降，銀根甚緊，人心轉軟，店蝟驟懈，北粳成交雖稀，暗中亦挫千餘元，南粳供應仍多，回跌二千餘元，秈米到銷依然寥寥，白元陰元均低落二千元之譜，形趨止漲轉跌之狀，油市則動盪劇烈，開盤後直綫下游，生油狂瀉一萬二三千元，豆汕猛跌三五千地，蔴油隨之下降三四千元，淸油則慘跌萬元有强，豆餅台灣汕頭吸胃不濃，回低二三百元，麵粉亦趨平疲，統粉回小三五百元，洋粉平定，麩皮亦回小一二百元，黃豆本街消化尙可，汕廠進蝟平常，結果軋小五五百元，赤豆零化頗殷，盤漲千元，彔豆南洋去化仍續，明定暗緊，挺昂千餘元，苞米靑島收購蟬聯，價格穩定，蠶豆貨稀牢硬，紅糧來去兩不見旺，小麥到不敵銷，依然挺秀，芝蔴站局。生仁廣帮消化轉淡，本街亦平平，高貨回小千餘元，中下則下跌二三千元。</p>
<p>又訊，自金鈔市價連日波動後，其他各貨價格，大部隨之上升，尤其民生必需品方面，食米與麵粉二項，均已超過評議價格，市政當局鋻於悄勢嚴重，已予嚴密注意，於各市塲加派幹員暗中監視，如有塲外擅做黑市交易者，立予嚴懲，故昨今兩市之段機騷動，已漸見歛跡，據社會局負責人對記者稱，決定於本週內召開米麵兩業評價審議會，並予竭力設法協助疏通物資來源，務使供求平衡，同時更加强監管各市塲銷售情形，務望絲毫物資不流入黑市，對於正當商人，除予以合理之利潤外，隨時輔導其納入正軌。</p>

<p>烚赤昨雖低而多盤，空方有補而多回頭，晨開三一九萬，央行即加壓力，立告下降，低價退至三〇六萬至三〇八萬之間，而後告定，乘低有實銷維持，買氣忽股，盤旋而漲，十時後央行以三一八萬之價配給三六條，此際曾見三二〇萬萬價，不久央行再旋壓力，曾再降至三一〇萬以內，但賣風甚暫，供源一止，買氣突振，隔夜浮空急補，而步漲至三三四萬，午刻回低至三二七萬左右徘徊，惟形勢已見穩定，午後隔日交割曾扳高至三四三萬，仍遭央和地壓迫，急切回跌至三二五萬左右。最後仍站三三二萬以上，較前收回升十三萬，飾金三五萬五，銀元平平，暗拆銀根稍鬆，暗息在一角半至二角之間。</p>
<p>外幣昨亦被動微升，美鈔晨開五九〇〇元，低價退至五八〇〇元，此後即逐漸回升至六四〇〇元，午刻在六一〇〇元至六三〇〇元之間盤旋，午後初穩後平，結果與前收相彷彿，港票受港申電上升影響，未熊趨升，反吿先穩後疲，但結果尙升三十元，港匯一二三〇元，印匯一五五〇元，英匯二〇五〇〇元，均有供少求。</p>

<p>— 西安八日航訊　本報特派員邵愼之</p>
<p>深夜到耀縣，城外雖有小店，但無法住宿，非叩關入城不可。此時天色如墨，伸手不見指，荒源夜沈，四野惟有犬聲吠寒。</p>
<p>耀縣城係傍漆水而築，垣堞甚高，入城須過漆水，而此岸復有柵門，欲叩關必先叩柵門。所謂碉堡綫者，離城僅十餘華里。上午在三原，其軍隊中有人吿我：「你到耀縣時，或許尙可聞槍聲，剛才有電話，共軍正在打打綫。」我現在到此「重地」，時己深夜，預想必然刁斗森嚴，於是打好如何賺關的主意，把毛氈搭在肩上，持手電筒探路前進。</p>
<p>夜賺耀關　紅纓槍下柵門開</p>
<p>走了一段路，即聞黑暗中大聲問口令，順手電光看過去，乃是一桿紅纓槍，身穿黑衣的民衆自衛隊，但見他橫槍站在柵門口，攔住去路。向他說明來處及即須入城的意思。這紅纓槍回答說：『這柵門是鎖住的。你到北頭去看。」於是再望北走一段路，又碰到紅纓槍。我想如果也鎖住了，必須設法要他啓鎖，不料柵門虛掩着，同紅纓槍說了幾句簡短的話。聽說我來自三原，遂毫無留雞地拉開柵門。</p>
<p>從平坦的石橋上渡漆水，上一條很陡的長坡，長坡盡處就是關得鐵緊的城門。呌關後有一個人頭自門縫中露出來與我對話。我如與他說上海記者，他必然弄不淸，必然不開門，乃對他說我是這裏專員公署的，自三原回城，有要緊公事，看樣子並不如想像中的森嚴。正在交涉，後面又來兩個軍人，他們代替了我的位置，向着那個頭以命令口吻發話，要他開關。門漸漸拉開，只見那個頭是一個荷槍實彈的士兵。</p>
<p>我們快步入關，城中毫無燈光，靜寂如死，一路在街角巷口，又碰到不少紅纓槍。賴一位軍人的帮助，給我碰開了一家浴池兼客店的門，店人睡眼惺忪，齒間嗤嗤作響，給我疊被泡茶，看看這客店的景象，知道所謂「陝北門戶」的耀縣，社會生活的貧苦。水是鹹的，彼是黑的，炕是凉的。加之滿天雪意，益增悽愴。</p>
<p>宋將韓琦，范仲淹曾開府延安，以禦三邊。所謂百二秦關，成楡道上的金鎖即其中之一。防邊於百二秦關之外，當時是遠戊生活。形勢失利時，范仲淹曾在關內的耀縣開府，其時稱耀州。「小范老子腹中自有數萬甲兵」，耀縣人亦十分景仰范仲淹。現在的縣政府即是其開府所在，叱咤西陲的一代名將，他升堂點兵的地方仍在，現在額匾爲「景范堂」，成爲縣政府的法庭。庭院迫窄，有老柏一株，光綫黯淡，面對城中心的鼓樓，即在百步以外。</p>
<p>使人感到昔時邊城戎鼓的情調，宛然聞金戈鐵馬之聲。</p>
<p>然而耀縣在關中，不是漢唐的邊城，但東漢亦有西羗，整個關中形爲邊地。腹地邊城，時移景遷，己不覺數千年。城外漆沮二水，流聲潺潺，道盡滄桑。它一向離開長安「遠」，現在雖然通了鐵道，可是仍然交通困難。耀縣人終於追緬着古代，信仰神話和傳說。</p>

<p>耀縣也有一個碑林，一個有心人集藏着六十幾方石碑，一間獨門屋，黑暗無光，彷彿如洞。其間都是北魏造像記，筆緻怪誕橫逸，不似龍門造像記中還有若干淸俊秀拔的東西。但有兩塊極完整的千佛碑，這不能去比雲岡或敦煌的規模，然而刻得整齊而精細，千個同樣的浮雕佛像，却同樣說明了佛敎文化的深度澎湃的思潮。此外還有幾個斷腿折足的六朝石佛。此外也還有十幾個襤褸如乞丐的中華民國陸軍步兵，他們有幾個也像六朝石佛一樣，坐在獨門前面的壁根下，看一片大操塲上的紅纓槍在一二三四，有的則在魏碑旁邊堆些枯枝黃葉，燃火取暖，烟薰得刺人眼鼻和嚨喉。我鑽進這己成烟洞的小屋，含着眼淚看完那些筆緻怪誕的碑和石佛，這羣活的石佛站起來向我說：</p>
<p>「我們咱辦呢？官長。」我也不知道咱辦，同他們一談，這才衆　齊發，嘮叨不休。說是他們原是廿二軍，駐偷林的，因爲「八路軍打我們」，被俘虜了。「八路軍來得好多啊！我們咱不打敗呢？」我說西安不是飛隊伍來救了嗎？「那是我們胶了以後才來救的啊！」他們說：「八路就這樣對我們說：你們打啥？你們打塔了才來救。你們願幹八路的就在這裏幹，不願送你們回去。我們可不願幹，那邊一路上送過來，也憑你吃個飽，可是到了這邊，縣政府每天只發一人兩個　，咱吃得飽？還不相信我們嘆。天冷！」</p>
<p>原來如此。無怪要向我這「官長」咱辦了？他們蒙着一身嫌疑喟兩個　，不知算是救濟，還是一種懲罰。我爲他們在這小城裏問來問去，問不出一個辦法來，大勢所趨，我明白了，原來辦法是早已經決定了的，是無爲而治的聽其自然。</p>
<p>耀縣人自以爲居住在一隻船中間。西北缺乏水，自己幻想着所住的地方是一隻船，他們說得有理：你看，一條沮水，一條漆水，縣城就像浮在中間的一隻船。不知什麼年代，縣衙裏　了一口井，這船就漏了，耀縣淹在水裏，後來趕快塡實，這鑄一個鐵半鎭往這條船，不讓它在水裏盪動，讓我們平平穩穩地過日子。我果然看到一頭鐵牛。這比舊約上說的方舟更多現實的意義。他們還誇耀着唐代的書法家柳公權和隋代的進土孫思邈，這是陝北人所虔誠供奉的藥王。城北的柳家原便是柳公權的故里，於是這地名，便從唐代一直保留到現在</p>
<p>三原往北，地勢一直向上，遠遠看來是一座山，爬到山頂一看却是一個平原，又遠遠看外山，爬到上山時又見是一個平原。有一股粗擴雄險的氣魄。這就是所謂秦隴邱原的特色。這一帶地名便是什麽原什麽原。原字的廣泛應用起於秦中，長安南有樂游原，在古代中國文學上道盡旖旎風光。而這裏的原是田莊，是農作。是所謂關中平原區的邊緣地帶，涇惠渠區得天獨厚，棉花每畝可以收到一百二十斤的世界紀錄，而這裹不過二三十斤，比起來懸殊，但也够一般水準，土質薄，水利不敷，靠天收，秦中有「八十三月雨」之諺，即每年靠天在三八，十三個月下雨，收獲才有望，這諺語特別適用於耀縣以北缺乏利地帶。</p>
<p>這幾天碉綫緊張，我到時未聞搶聲，專員縣長大喊不得了。陸軍總司令顧祝同上次到西安來，對他們說得明明白白：「假使丟了縣政府守辦公室，丟了辦公室守公桌。」這是縣長的責任。城門口檢查特別嚴。</p>
<p>一個破碎的縣城，大街上也攤滿馬騾糞，讓它容易乾，因爲嚴冬就要降臨，城東約有一座山取名「五台山」，以裝點耀縣人的信仰。更裝飾得美麗的是藥王廟，金壁輝煌，一條大車道直通縣城，終年香火不絕，廟裏的道士吃得好。縣城裏的中學生都跪在泥像面前叩頭，手搖　筒，替他家裏的什麼人求取藥方。孫思邈無疑是唐代好醫生，據嶺靖刻碑記，說唐太宗嘗訪孫，請其出仕，而孫仍結壚於此。讚之謂「不爲三公，必爲明醫。」封眞人。孫著有「千金實要，」宋徽猷閣直學士郭思，會刻石於華州，以廣流傳，後又在道廟中再刻一套。現在這些石碑完整如昔，因爲塌拓不多，字跡淸晰，都是些單方。其中「海上方」碑則刻孫著枕上記和養生銘，多合科學原則，而通篇要義則是靜的養生，表露了儒家與道家思想合流的痕跡，文化的落後，表現了神鬼勢力的强盛，耀縣人提酒上山，去供奉這樣的廟神像發光，神話流傳，而生活窮困，如果有人去閉鎖它，無疑會被嚴重反對。有些人的見解，以爲沈入迷信總比覺醒好；况且他們獲得新的得救不知在何年何日。</p>

<p>咸同支綫到耀縣是終點，耀縣到同官以南五里堡的煤礦有拉煤車，也售客票，自五里堡到同官金鎖關，則須套車式乘馬。</p>
<p>在這一帶的邱原上，縱馬馳騁，勒繮看無限天地，西北地位的提高，自江海充份發展內陸，使它在閉塞與落後這些名稱中解放出來。</p>
<p>自耀縣到金鎖關的北行道上，麥色靑靑，然而荒地還是那麼多。政府鼓勵開荒，但鬧過一陣後，只剩下標語：「公私荒地，任人開墾。」並無大効力。因爲開墾須資本與勞力，而推動一個新運動還須組織。歷年來各縣政府所忙的主題是辦軍差，一直維持着老的生產方式，同官一縣就築了兩百座碉堡，而全縣人口不過五萬六千。耀縣全縣不過五萬人，三原不到十萬，宜君不到四萬，都同樣有着嚇人的負祖。</p>
<p>一條公路大體上順着漆水北去，兩邊是山，黃土剝蝕盡了的地方，露出二疊紀石灰岩層，還有沙礫岩和頁岩，而我所見到的麥地就在漆水兩岸。馬和騾在田裏跑，不以爲奇，啃麥來吃，也不以爲奇，而江南人看來就不免以爲奇。這時農家不希望天雨或轉暖，否則麥子長高，便難望明年的好收獲，因爲地土鬆，怕畏不結實，甚至須要壓一决，於是這些麥子便像一堆堆野齊菜似的，平平扁扁的攤在地裏。這時不忌驟馬的踐踏和啃吃，只要它長得牢就好。這裹農諺說：「正月猪，二月貓，三月裏婆娘滿地跑。」正月莊稼未發，還任憑猪亂跑，二月貓號春不落家，三月農婦到處檢地菜。整個北方的小麥帶都如此。</p>
<p>一路上盡是趕騾子的莊稼漢，有自金鎖關一帶運煤至耀縣去的，有裝包谷到城裏去賣的，而絕然不見旅行惟一利器的騾車，可見沒有行旅。古道西風，而我所騎的馬借自軍中，却並不瘦，同這些莊稼漢同行，頗有人瘦戰馬肥之感。他們驅趕騾羣，大聲吆喊，或者親應到地駡着，鞭子劈拍作響，使古道减少一點寂寞。他們的吆喊聲只有一個簡短的口令，大多是有一個音，偶或用捲舌音。他們說趕騾子有一百多個口令，文字或注音符號都不能紀錄的，左右疾徐，都能用口令指揮，但我學了他們的口令却指揮不動，他們說：「驪子可認得聲音啊」。驟子都　得很肥，他們說：「四魚　到，強如餌料啊。」這確語說只要拌草勻了，牲口自會吃盡，不消特別餌料的。</p>
<p>他午依賴着可憐的農業，神祇宗所積累下來的晨事知識生活。往往有許多動人的農　在中國農村中埋藏着，這裏也不例外。他們歌詠着野草，說：「正月茵陳二月　，三月割來當柴燒」。把正月的嫩草說成茵陳一樣的芬芳，並且推頌茵陳（藥屬，可浸酒），二月草綠，三月以後的草茂盛，準備作燃料了，這時則正是地凍草黃的季候。說着說着，我竟記下了一大堆諺語。覺得緯度的不同，水利和地質氣候的不同，他們望雨望早，或者預測天候，和江南有着顯著的不同了</p>
<p>對於動物和植物，都有他們自己的稱呼，雄的猪和狗稱牙猪牙狗，雌的則稱草猪草狗。對於貓則稱郎貓和女貓了。可是雄馬呌兒馬，雌馬呌騾馬。而雄騾則稱呌騾，雌的稱草騾。中歲的的猪又有特別稱呼，他們呌「喀郎子」。蟋蟀呌醋蜘蛛，螞蟻呌屁浮馬。這些都是土語，把遠志稱為野扁豆，柴胡稱爲雞舌頭。他們痛惡杜鵑，呌它「殺人强盜」，因爲呌聲難聽，一無好感，並不知道士丈夫和詩人給予這鳥的雅稱。</p>
<p>麥地裏的野鴿和野雞一大羣一大羣地集合着，飛翔遲緩，數目又多。如有獵槍定可收獲。</p>
<h3 id="c185">同官煤礦 <a href="#c185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>去年雙十節，同官縣改名爲銅川縣。陝西人說起同官的時候，特稱北同官，因為讀音和潼關相同，電報局的拉丁字母拼音遇到了難題，常把兩縣的電報發錯。但同官煤礦仍是同官煤礦。</p>
<p>西安的煤荒鬧得很嚴重，可是在耀縣銅川却積着幾萬噸的煤，四五萬元一噸的混煤，西安的價格要高三借。成同支錢上的職工，有丟掉了搖紅綠旗工作去販煤的，利市三倍。問隴海路爲什麽不能把煤運到西安去，搶救一個冬天的煤荒。回答說是車輛不够。目前同官礦平均一天可產六百五六十噸，隴海路的需要量是六百噸，那一點尾數就拉出。可是同官煤礦的投資，隴海路三分之二，省政府三分之一，依照股本計算，省政府說應該給他們二百噸。煤商本領大，無論如何可以設法運一點出來，因爲利息尙隴海路變相賣車皮，而一路上騐車匠轉轍夫以至職員，都有勒索現象，車站上每個人負都有很大的櫂力，一個轉轍夫說不扳道就開不出車。販運也困難重重。西安煤價更得這樣荒唐的高是隴每路的過失。因此咸楡公道上有長途跋涉的騾羣和手推小車運煤。同官縣二十十幾家私營小礦。這些走販選大塊的才要，因為便於裝運，小塊或碎煤堆在礦裏，無人去問。隴海路有一個隴海企業公司，日本侵略東北的滿鐵，以鐵路爲中心，發展企業，大做生意，陜西人說隴海路有啥企業。把路辦好就是了。聽說最近才向當局去登記。</p>
<p>我到五里鋪同官官煤礦時新舊廠長正同盟交替竣事，礦長係省府和路局所組的理事會所決定，新礦長馬靑苑是老同盟會員，從陝西靖國軍時代起，到中央的統治力量伸入陝西，他的軍隊進入西安而就任第一任警備司令，一直到反對楊虎城，都採取堅態度。勝利前是軍委會參議？今年退休，領得退休金，「沒有這筆退休金，連路也走不成。」這五十四歲的老軍人持着堅定的態度對我說：」同官煤礦在抗戰中有了貢獻，而且是西北惟一的一個大煤礦，我們必須要把眼光放遠，站在開發西北的立塲上來經營這個礦。」一說到煤質，則不能比河南觀音堂，焦作更比不上，含硫百分之五，半烟煤。他說：「如果將來交通暢達之後，別的礦產量供應一靈活，這個礦就會有問題。」然而他相信站在開發西北的立場上，決不嫌多開一個礦，「而且可以設法減輕成本，使售價低廉。」</p>
<p>這礦上工人六千多，待映每工不過一千六百元左右，工程師的月薪也不過二十萬元右。待遇低，應該立刻提高。隴海路取去六百噸煤，只按成本加百分二十的利潤，然而隴海路拖着款子不給自己不能賣煤，隴海路的虧賬由煤礦來賠貼了。於是慨嘆着對我說：「我不過才來八天，內部情形還不很明瞭，我終覺得這個問題很嚴重。人事問題很多。現在第一件事是調整待遇，官營企業的缺點就是事務人員多，有時待遇比工程人員還高，這裏也是這種不合理現象。我已經對大家說過了，我決不是到礦上來賺錢的，如果我取非份之財，請職工檢舉我。」</p>
<p>目前來說，四個廠，十二個井，幾個是廢井，三個井包給商人，開工約有七個。動力是幾個廢車頭，材料機器是戰時凑合的，如果增加設備，事實上辦不到，辦到了自然增加產量，運輸問題不得解決，仍然說不到發展。工人都住在窰洞裏，窰洞漫暖，十二月裏也有蚊子。礦上的醫院有紀錄，去年診了七千八百次瘧疾之類的傳染，這就是說，平均每個人都看過一次病。其次是眼病，再其次是呼吸器管病。都有數千次的診治。</p>
<p>礦區的面積有二千六百餘公頃，估計儲量五千萬噸。整個同官煤藏係屬石炭二疊配含煤系，橫貫東西的大背斜石灰岩，，把它劃為南北兩區。經過探礦，土法採煤的煤井，有穿透了含煤系而盤至石灰岩的，用柱狀剖面圖來觀察，北部煤倉，向西北頃斜，東高西下，南仰北低，平均的厚度可達四公尺，總面積四千四百七十萬平方公尺，比重以一點三計，三數相乘，則得總儲量二八四四四萬公噸，可採者或僅半數，則日產四千公噸，亦可開掘百年，然而目前，包括二十多個私營小礦在內，每天不過一千二百市噸。</p>
<p>我跑到六十幾公尺深的一號井去，沒有沼氣，可以點油燈，這井用房柱法開採，礦槽發展有七八百市畝的面校，在石灰岩的天然孔隙中排水。同官岩層軟頁多，硬頁少，只能採用房柱法。礦工們頭裏厚布，汕燈綱紥在額前，烟焰飛舞，手推小車，或拖着煤筐，像蚯蚓一樣蠕動着。這也是生活。他們工作八小時或十二小時，輪　替換，科營土法開採礦，工人十日牛月換班，換班期內，寢食都在井底，不見天日，是實實在在的地下工作者。</p>

<p>關中盆地自潼關迄　鷄，所謂涇渭平原，其形勢宛如京滬之間，然其寬度不過數十里，面積不過四萬方里。（我於「關中霜雪滿田園」一稿中，述及陝省水利局的灌溉工程，而此外尙有陝省農業改進所協助地方建設的幾個渠：武功偉惠渠，灌地二千畝：雲陽引洪渠，灈地二萬畝，此渠係築壩阻導山洪溉田，山洪冲刷而下，中含燐肥獨多；渭南湭惠渠，灌地二萬畝，係撥用英援華會款所築，今冬可完工；富平富惠渠，灌地二萬畝，明春可放水。陝西灌溉工程，大抵盡此。）由三原至耀縣數十里外，已到了平原的邊綠，我爬上一山，即見是一片平原，這實是黃土台地，到同官則進入山地，至宜君而更高，成爲分隔陝北與關中的脊背。宜君夏日須穿夾衣，漢武帝曾建玉華宮，以爲避著所。宜君北去黃陵洛川，地勢又低；金鎖關在宜君同官之間，雄峙山中，儼然天塹，成爲古來要險，並非偶然。</p>
<p>關中平原西高東下，西北倚六盤山，北隔子午嶺；同宜以北的陝北地區，實亦爲一盆地，倚子午嶺，西高東下，一片黃土及紅色土，爲良好宜麥帶。陝北閉塞，民貧而地並不瘠，實與一般想像大爲相殊。秦漢以還，棄於西羗，歷代西睡有事，常以爲兵戈衝要。左宗棠平回，屬部劉松山由西安北討綏德，民國以後，則又有所謂「套匪」之亂。李自成起自陝北，更無論矣。於是水利不修，文敎不振，廟堂以爲邊塞，士宦以爲畏途。關中陝北，咫尺千里。雖有沃野，不知開發，西北大部如此，豈獨陝北一隅？觀涇惠渠區一帶，水利整修以後的情景，再躍馬於金鎖關前，童山濯濯，剝蝕劇烈，溝谷縱橫，邱原可爲良田，於今盡屬廢壤。朝野高談政論，干戈擾攘未已，碉堡綫上，鴉片充斥，行愈北，問其價則愈賤。民生凋蔽，可以想見。</p>
<p>記者所經地區，地形極為複雜，細部測量，最感棘手。子午嶺紆行至宜君同官，初看都是黃土層，但同官東南地區則有大部份的露天紅色土，恐即爲著名的三門系紅色土。黃土層原是蓋在紅色土上的，最厚可達數十公尺，可見沖刷剝蝕的劇烈。合原所以遠看如山岡，實由於剝蝕割裂的緣故，往往兩個平原之間，隔着一道深谷，彼此不能通行，須繞很多的路，而谷底，復成車道或麥田。數小時的大雨，可以產生一條溝，黃土千仞，雖若不墜，但剝蝕的容易程度，却是極可估計的。</p>
<p>同官縣城在間，居民不過二千數百人，出北閩行三十里而至金鎖關，西去關錢亦僅十餘里至二十除里，記者本擬北行黃陵，然此際道途多阻，時生變故，十日行程，經歷七縣，已可略窺風土，乃折返西安。金鎖關建置於宋，淸代汛防，僅有守備一員，其後改駐把總一員，守兵二十名，每年每兵不過支銀八月，月支一兩，年給米五石，由縣供給，現縣人尙能道之，可見今昔負擔之殊。現記者躍馬關前，惟見一帶關牆，迤山而下，兩山合聚，石岩壁之，陡成險道，拓舊日關口爲北行公路，昔日的「雄關」作用已完全消失，登關四望，蒼茫八荒，縱目南望，居高臨下，一覽無遺。邊關遺址，還有從前營房和懇地，半叢衰柳，彷彿如一個蒼髯老卒，荷鋤耕於山麓，望着南山的夕陽。</p>

<h3 id="c187">略論血漿之用途 <a href="#c187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>— 易見龍</p>
<p>第二次大戰期中治療藥物有顯着進展。這顯著的進展實使人類健康和生命得到更深一層的保障，依進展的程序而論可以說第一是礦　製劑之綜合與演化；第二是血漿之保存及無限制的使用；第三是盤尼西林的發明及大量出產，國內人士對第一及第三者的治療價値顯然已有相當的了解，而對於第二者的用途及用法似仍是一知半解，甚至因用之不得其法反而因啼廢食。作者在抗戰前期曾在加美兩國隨專家硏究輸血療法，歸國後又在昆明主持血庫多年。爰就研究及經騐所得，作一簡略的介紹。</p>
<p>（一）成份——欲知血漿之用途，必先明白血漿之有效成分。血漿係由未凝結之血液製成，爲膠體及晶體物質之混合物。其有效成分可分述如左：</p>
<p>（A）營養必需物——凡已經腸胄消化之營養物質必須經血漿之吸收和轉運，始可達到人體各部之組織，又組織內剩餘或儲蓄之營養物質亦須經過血漿之吸收和轉運始可進入營養貧乏之組織。由是觀之，血漿不啻爲營養物質之總踏，凡人體所需之營養物質如蛋白質，氨基酸，脂肪，脂酸，葡萄糖，維他命及無基鹽等無不應有盡有。</p>
<p>（B）維持滲透壓之物質——健康人體之循環血量恒有一定，的爲體質百分之九。其所以能保持一定者，多賴血漿內之滲透壓，該種滲透壓能阻止血管內液體之滲出，其已滲出者仍可使其回至血管以內。血內維持滲透壓之物質有二即蛋白質及鹽類是也。</p>
<p>C內分泌素——內分泌素爲經常調整人體各部變遷之機稱。例如甲狀腺及生長素之控制發育，胰島素之控制碳水化物新陳代謝及卵巢素之控制生育等是也，此種內分泌素發源於內分泌腺，隨由血液送至各種器官，是以血漿內亦有內分泌素之存在。</p>
<p>（D）各種酵素——人體內之新陳代謝及抗毒作用多以酵素爲媒介，血漿內所含酵素不一而足，其最著者爲凝血酵素。</p>
<p>（E）各種抗體——人體如受細菌之侵襲即生抗體，在血漿內循環以與細菌相抗，血內抗體之種類及多寡人各不同，在多數混合之血漿內，抗體種類及含量，大抵較多。</p>
<p>（F）其他來歷不明之生活素。</p>
<p>（二　)用途及用法_知血漿之有效成分，即可推知其用途。關於血漿之用途及用法可以分述於左</p>
<p>（A）創傷性及手術性休克</p>
<p>關於休克（Shock）之病源，至今尙無定論，但其顯著之病理變化，爲血漿逃出血管以外則己爲大衆所公認。由於某種惡性因素之作用，以致皿管擴張滲透力加大，血漿逃至周圍組織之內。因此循環血量大爲减少，組織內氧氣及其他營養之供給均感不足，如不立即救治，在九至十二小時之內，患者大抵死亡救治休克之有效方法，在於迅速灌注血漿。美國休克專家施歌德氏之言曰：「當輸血而不輸血則死可立待，輸血不足則徒勞無功。」血比重，分血計及血壓三者爲決定輸血時間及數量之標準。如血比重及分血計高於正常而血壓降至百分之七十以下，是爲血液過濃心臟排血量大减之明證，應即灌注大量血漿，直至三者復原爲止。我國休克患者之表情往往不如白種人之顯著，雖已臨生死關頭其狀鎭靜如故，故化騐診斷甚爲重要。如患者尙能進食，且無乾涸症象，則可由靜脈濯注濃縮血漿或濃縮血淸蛋白藉以增加血管內之滲　透壓，俾已滲透至週圍組織內之血漿回至血管以內，爲預防手術休克之產生，最好在施行大手術之前後灌輸三百至五百公分之血漿。此種處置在美國各大醫院之手術室中已成不可缺少之常規。</p>
<p>（B）流血性休克</p>
<p>內外損傷流血固可以引起休克，但大量之咯血，腸胃流血，子宮外孕流血及血崩等亦何嘗不可引起嚴重之休克。此種休克與上述休克之異點爲血比重，分血計及血壓三者同時下降。在此種情况之下，應迅速由多數靜脈同時灌注血漿使息者渡過危險時期，然後繼以全血或紅血球之濯注。蓋循環血量如損失在三分之一以上，則可致性命危險，而紅血球之損失如不超過百分之六十則仍可維持其最低限度之換氣作用也。</p>
<p>（C）灼傷或燙傷</p>
<p>最重之灼傷或燙傷均可引起休克，故除局部治療外應灌注血漿，冀以制止休克。即在休克過去以後，患部仍有血漿繼續滲出，據施歌德氏之估計，人體三級灼傷如達全身面積三分之一，則廿四小時內患處血漿損失的在四百公分以上，爲維持患者正常血量，血漿之灌注殊爲必要。如患者尙能自進飲料，則宜用濃縮血漿。</p>
<p>（D）繼發性貧血</p>
<p>此種貧血之療法，在消滅其症源，並促進紅血球之產生。欲促進紅血球之產生，務須儘量供給製造紅血球之原料，此則包括蛋白質及鐵質等物，血漿內含充份之蛋白質及其他之滋養物質，可以供給一部份紅血球製造之原料，故可爲鐵劑治療之輔助物。</p>
<p>（E）營養不良</p>
<p>嚴甫營養不良，血液中蛋白白每低於正常。結果血中水份繼續滲透至週園組織，形成週身水　，對於該種病病惟有根據血中蛋白之測騐，連續注射濃縮血漿，方可使病者迅速復原。</p>
<p>（F）蛋白缺乏症</p>
<p>由於腎小管脂肪性變化所引起之血蛋白缺乏症，此種患者之血蛋白常繼續自腎臟中排出。因此血內蛋白顯著减低，亦可形成週身水腫，此種病人亦宜用血漿治療，如每日排泄之蛋白質在廿五公分以上，而患者不能多進蛋白質，則每日應輸入血漿四百公分，蓋血漿中之蛋白普通在百分之七左右也。</p>
<p>（G）熱病</p>
<p>如腸熱症，斑疹傷寒，及結核病患者腸胃消化及吸收旣不正常，而體質之消耗又大，結果乃有負的氮平衡（Negative　NitrogenBalance）此種病理變化不使降低患者之抵抗力並且可引起不良之複雜症。若於多進飲料之外再連續注射血漿，則可增進患者之營養及抵抗力。</p>
<p>（H）腸胃病</p>
<p>此種患者無論已否施用手術治療，如不能多進營養料則必至每况愈下。補救之法在連續注射血漿以增進營養及患部之痊愈。靜止不動之成人每日至少需要蛋白質五十公分，即需要七百公分之血漿，健康血漿每百公分的含蛋白質七公分。</p>
<p>（I）急性傳染病</p>
<p>混合人體血漿旣有各種抗體，故對於痳疹，百日咳，水痘，猩紅熱，丹毒及臟腺炎等均有預美國兒科專家鮑氏Bavenberg之實驗證明已作痳疹預防注射之四七三三兒童中（每人自肌肉內注射血漿廿至四十公分），僅發現六個初發性痳疹，而未作痳疹預防注射之一一二八〇兒意中，即有九十四人患初發性痲疹。</p>
<p>（J）不足月之嬰犯</p>
<p>現代醫學進步，對於懷胎不滿六月而出生之嬰兒亦可保持生命，除調節溫箱溫度供給氧氣及特別營養外，並可連續注射小量血漿。</p>
<p>（K）腦內壓增加及乳房內結塊</p>
<p>對於此種患老如能迎續注射濃縮血漿或濃縮之血淸蛋白並同時减少飲料，則所獲效果遠較施用硫酸鎂劑瀉劑之治療爲佳。</p>
<p>血漿之用途雖多，但亦有禁忌症，如醫臟機能障碍，血壓過多，充血性心衰弱或急性肺水腫，則灌注血漿務宜愼重，大量尤爲不宜。</p>
<p>（三）血漿優劣鑑別方法——抗戰勝利以後，美國軍用剩餘之乾血漿亦隨其他之剩餘物資流入我國市塲。孰優孰劣，近代藥典尙無鑑定方法。但各種出品良莠不齋，在所不免。爲便於識別起見，特略述乾血漿鑑別法，以供用者之參考：</p>
<p>（A）顏色——失效之乾血漿，爲輕鬆無定形粉末，恒呈草黃色，其凝結不散或帶淡綠色者不可用。</p>
<p>（B）未失效之乾血漿在加入蒸溜水後一分鐘內應全部溶解。</p>
<p>（C）溶液混濁度——混濁爲液體血漿常有之物理性質，但在電光比色器下，其混濁度不應超過七百度。</p>
<p>（D）殘餘水份（Resicual　Moisture）——乾血漿內之殘餘水份不宜超過％1.0.</p>
<p>（E）無致熱質——所謂致熱質者，即細菌屍體或細菌之排世物。如配製血漿之器具不經特製藥品之洗滌，或溶化乾血漿之汽水未經特製濾過器之消毒，則發熱作用無法避免。</p>
<h3 id="c188">蛋白質水解產物　其生理作用及治療效能 <a href="#c188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>— 許肇堆講　陶壽淇記</p>
<p>蛋白質榮養之深刻研究，四十餘年前即已開始。當時著名學者對於食物之蛋白質含量，蛋白質與氮之變換數，身體之氮量平衡，以及蛋白質之生物價値等，不無供獻。以後之硏究，關於氨基酸之分析，主要氨基酸之檢定，蛋白質與水腫之關係等等，亦曾逐一闡明。然而，以往之工作，大致散漫而無系統統其中Chittende氏之硏討，認謂人體對於蛋白質之需要及耐受量相當低微，結果不無兇險之影響，因爲一般人士之印象，皆以爲人體所需之蛋白質極易應付。當時，維生素之硏究日見發展，不久即顯示其重要性。因此，近日之一般臨床醫生，但知注重維生素而往往不顧及蛋白質之重要。直至最近，由於新穎簡快之蛋白質檢定方法之應用，以及蛋白質水解產產物之大量生產與治療上之發展，故而蛋白質榮養一題，遂重復引起醫學界之興趣及注意焉。</p>
<p>蛋白質之主要功能茲將蛋白質對於人體之主要功能略述如次；</p>
<p>（一）保持皿量——蛋白質之緊急功用血漿內之蛋白質乃一膠性體，故能產生一有效之滲透壓，以抵抗毛細管血壓，使血管內之液體不致過份溢出，而血量藉以保持。任何創傷之處，除出血外常有血漿蛋白質之滲出，使血液之滲透壓降低而因此加重血量之減少。</p>
<p>（二）保持組織之完整褥瘡之硏究結果，已顯示蛋白質對於組織完整之重要。患褥瘡之病人，血內蛋白質過低而氮平衡呈負性。如能增加其蛋白質之攝入，使氮平衡轉爲正性，則褥瘡亦隨之痊癒，蓋缺乏蛋白質榮養之組織，活力減低而易於崩潰也。</p>
<p>（三）促進傷口之癒合蛋白質缺乏，影響纖維組織之生長，使任何傷口碍難收縮。手術後之傷口，遇血漿內蛋白質過低時，常有崩裂之趨向，倘能使蛋白質之入量增加，傷口即霍然癒合。</p>
<p>（四）助長免疫體，內分泌及酵素之產生此項功能之存在，僅屬假說，尙待明確之證實後，方能成立。</p>
<p>（五）恢復期之功用疾病恢復時期之蛋白質新陳代謝，由於下列因素之作用，常起顯著之變化：甲患病時發生食慾不振，惡心，或嘔吐者，可减少蛋白質之入量。乙醫院中之飲食，因經濟上或其他困難，所含之蛋白質分量時常過低。丙胃腸道失常之病人，則蛋白質之吸收不良。丁滲出作用之影饗——身體喪失任何液體，必同時喪失蛋白質，尤以受灼傷之表面或大膿腔內所滲出之液體，所含之蜜白質量特高。故而患廣大面積之灼傷或膿胸等之病人，每日所損失之蛋白質量，常不下五十至六十克。戊在疾病或創傷時期由小便中排出之蛋白質量，往往較正常時超出數倍。由上述五點，可見疾病或創傷時期之人體，常受大量蛋白質之剝奪。因此，恢復時期有補充蛋白質之必要。</p>
<p>高度滋義療法　通常天然飲食中每日所含之氮量約十克，高蛋白質飲食中則爲二十克。所以，如果在病熊情况下，蛋白質之需要增加至相當程度時，則決非天然飲食所能應付，而必須給與氨基酸（Amion-acids）或蛋白質水解產物（Protein　hycrolysates）。蛋白質入量之需要超過天然食物所能供給之分量時，即稱之謂高度滋養（byperalimentation）.</p>
<p>蛋白質水解產物之應用　純粹之氨基酸混合劑，（譯者按：氨基酸乃蛋白質消化或分解時所變成之最後產物，即以此由胃腸道吸收，其與蛋白質之關係猶如葡萄糖之與炭水化合物也。）製造困難而價格高昂，故而不如蛋白質水解產物之適用。蛋白質水解產物可自牛乳·肉·魚·大豆·釀母·或其他含有蛋白質之食品製造。蛋白質水解產物之施用，有以下數優點：（一）不需要消化。（二）容量小。（三）可作藥物服用，不受胃口之影響。（四）與醫院當局意欲節省病人飲食方面之開支者，可免衝突。其主要缺點爲：（一）味不佳。（二）大量服用時可引起腹瀉。</p>
<p>蛋白質水解產物治療上之用途</p>
<p>（一）消化性潰瘍　消化性潰瘍之高度滋養療法，已由薛邦祺醫師於前期本列加以討論，故本篇中毋須　述。</p>
<p>（二）榮養不良　榮養不良之病人，治以高度滋養療法，可於四五日內使浮腫消退，而血液內蛋白質及紅血球量復原。</p>
<p>（三）肺結核症　高度滋養療法與其他治療肺結核症之方法並用，可加速病况之進步。</p>
<p>（四）手術後之療理　施行外科手術，尤以胃腸道之手術後，施用高度滋養療法，可以促進病人之榮養而縮短其恢復時期。。</p>

<p>葉酸（Folic　Acid）的發現，雖然已有多年，但是到最鈑才闡明其化學構造，而其人工合成才吿成功。</p>
<p>從化學上言之，葉酸是由下列三個不同之化學荃團組成：翅素（Pterin），對氨安息香酸（p-Aminobenroic　acid），及鈇氨基酸（Glutamic　acid）。翅素是蝴蝶翅膀的一種黃色素；葉酸亦係黃色的結晶。</p>
<p>葉酸原係乙種維生素複合體（Vitamin　B　Complex）中的一種成分，初稱酪乳菌因素，因酪乳菌繁育時必需此營養因素故也。最近報吿，葉酸亦係人類造血機能所需之要素，對於種種巨細胞性貧血具有特效，與肝製劑無異。按肝製劑提純困難’而其檢定又非用惡性貧血之臨床病例不可，故價格高昂，應用不便。葉酸爲人工合成品，母需生物檢定，將來大量生產，價格必低，其完全取代肝製劑之日當在不遠。</p>
<p>遠在一九三五年，戴氏（Day）等早己報吿，天然葉酸（當初稱M種維生素）有防治白鼠之一種營養性貧血之效。但此人工合成品，對於人類巨細胞性貧血之療效，至一九四五年，始由美國維生素專家施筆士氏（Spies）等發現。氏等試於美國南部所常見之營養性巨細胞性貧血數例，獲得與肝製劑同樣之療效。即血中綱織血球數迅速增加，隨以紅血球數與血紅素量之堅定上昇。本年又試用於斯　盧症（Spjes），妊娠期巨細胞性貧血及眞性惡性貧血等，均得同樣之成功。此種結果業經同國之Darby氏Moore氏等，及Zuclzer　＆Cgden等加以充分證實。最近英國Wilkinson等採用葉酸於惡性貧血五例，亦獲得同樣之滿意成績。</p>
<p>雖然，葉酸並非即係肝製劑中之有效成分（補血素）蓋葉酸係鮮明橙黃色結晶，而最精製之肚　骨則係無色。Willmson氏認爲，葉酸或能在體內刺激肝臟血素之生成。但據去年英國Jacobson　＆William兩氏在十月份病理學細菌學雜認中所發表之實騐報吿，則肝于臟補血素與葉酸恐係同屬之化合物，而其主要化學基團即係翅素。據此二學者之研究，合成之黃翅素（Xamthopterin），與白翅素（Leucopterin），與肝浸膏三者，均能對於摘除脾臟之家兎，產生同樣之網織血球反應，而其他物質如鐵及多種維生素（惜未試葉酸）則無此作用，故氏等認爲肝臟補血素或係一種翅素衍化物。</p>

<p>— 喬樹民</p>
<p>一曰關於健康之新界說——該組織法案之序文中，首揭最進步而廣義的健康界說，認爲健康是身體的，心理的，和社交的完全健全狀態，不僅免於疾病而巳。又認爲最高水準的健康，是每一個人類——不論其種族宗敎及政治信仰，經濟及社會地位如何——的基本權利。又認爲政府對於人民健康的保障，負有不可逃避的實任。讀者試思：我國人民對於健康涵意的看法如何？有多少人享受到這種基本權利？政府已盡到保障人民健康的責任吾？</p>
<p>二曰關於衛生之功能——他們都認爲科學的衛生學術，在此動盪的世界中，大有助於人類的和平相處。深信衛生設施，將提高人民的生活水準，促進社會的經濟繁榮。而協助完成吾人之共同目標——世界和平。他們都認爲祇有健康而營養無匱的人民，才能眞正了解基本自由的眞諦。又認爲公共衛生，是許多科學原理的活動的綜合的結晶體。許冬先進國家，由於衛生設施，人民的平均壽命巳較上一世紀延長了一倍。但是各國的發展情形，殊不平衡有些國家生出來的兒童，難得有半數能活到五歲，他們人民的平均壽命，祇及較運的國家人民的一半歲數，他們又認爲欲達到世界衛生機構的偉大目的，需要我們衛生聲學人員的最大的努力，持久的努力；但是僅僅靠我們的努力還不會够，我們必需動員所有人類，讓他們都能了解衛生的道理而共同奮鬥。讀者試思：我們的人民，有多少人够了解基本自由的眞諦？我們人民的平均壽命是多少？祇有天知道，也許祇及美英的一半，我們的衛生醫學人員，努力到什麼程度？人民又動員到什麽程度？</p>
<p>三曰關於不衛生的影響——他們都認爲：在衛生的領域中，國家是相互倚賴的，是息息相通的。任何地區的瘟疫，可以危害到別的國家。低的人民他康水準，不但妨醫其本國的經濟繁榮，且將影響到全世界的整個繁榮。讀者試思：我們年年常見的天花，霍亂，傷寒，痢疾，回　熱，　疾，黑熱病，鼠疫，鈎虫病，住血蟲病，結核病等等的流行，對於本國和世界的影響何如？</p>
<p>四曰關於世界衛生機構的今後使命——今後，所有過去成立的國際衛生組織，均將歸併到這個新的世界衛生機構裏來。牠將運用一切最近代化的科學知識和設備，來戰勝病魔瘟神，所以防疫自仍爲第一義。但此僅爲第一個步驟，須知世界上有幾多人民在飢餓綫下掙扎！所以運用我們的營養學識，來配合農業糧食一產方面的努力，以達到免於飢餓之自由，亦爲目標之一。第二個步驟，是要正面的積衡的推進生理的和心理的健康，以期達到更高水準的生理發育，更長的壽命，更有效方的生產方量，和更有意義的生命。</p>
<p>但是人類如果不能和平相處，再來一次大的戰爭。則一切將同歸於盡，衛生也是徒然。吾人應知科學可以爲善，亦可以爲惡，其關鍵不在科學家本身，而在廣大人羣的覺悟和良知，來決定人類命運的吉兇生死。就爭取世界和平的立塲而論，世界衛生機構，似不失爲團結全世界人民的一個聚點，各種文化不同信仰不同的人們的一個交誼應，也許可能成爲世界和平機構的一個熱石。不勝聚香祝之！</p>
<h3 id="c192">愛克斯光診斷下的　消化性潰瘍 <a href="#c192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>— 陳又新</p>
<p>愛克司光的胃部檢騐與肺部檢騐有兩點顯著的差別，第一點是組織方面的不同，肺能不靠一種另外的媒介而自然地在愛克司光下顯示出牠的輪廓來；對於胃這種自然的顯露是不可能的，所以通常需要一種特殊的藥品充實牠的內部才能被人家檢查出來，這種藥品若不是純粹的硫酸鋇即是硫酸鋇和着別的不重要的成份而合成的，單吃這種藥有一些石灰水樣子的外相，和一些泥土一樣的味兒，這種藥是很好的，在胃腸中不起什麼化學作用，不妨礙胃腸的工作，引不起什麽副作）用，又不毒，却能帮助檢查，第二點差別是胃的功作是間歇的而肺的工作是述續的，這樣胃的檢查需有一個起點一個終點，起點暈空肚的時候開始檢查，終點是胃中不再有鋇的餘漬的時候，在這兩者之間檢查可以依據實情而調節的。由此看來，胃部檢騐此肺部檢騐比較的繁複。</p>
<p>檢驗胃部的方法是透視與攝片並重的，依診斷的本身價値而論，透視比攝片益加重要，在透視的時候胃的位置可以自由變更，任何的部份可以摩撫，任何可疑的地方可以詳細的觀察，壓痛的地方可以測知，胃壁的柔軟或僵硬，粘着或獨聳，或者胃功用的亢進或者衰退，蠕動的自在或者斷續，還有幽門部或者任何部的肌肉縮緊或者鬆弛都可以得到一個正確的槪念，常然病原本身的印影也同時可以在透視板遇露出來，但是攝片也有特殊的效能，這不單是一種影子的紀錄可供後日的參考或者會診方面的藍本，同時也可以供給透視時所遺漏或者顯示得不淸楚的資料。</p>
<p>如若以上的方法不能歸納得一個正確的診斷，那麽還有幾種特殊的檢查方法可資利用，現在略而勿論，還有一種情况，胃部的病象是隨和別的部份或者別的系統所患的疾病而發生的，舉一人例說，很多的所謂消化不良或者胃痛是因為盲腸的疾病而發生的，也有所謂真正的胃壁腐爛却是因腦子毛病而得來的，但即若胃部本身的疾病，愛克司光檢騐也不一定能得確定的結論，不過大多數的失敗，多半是爲了病態的輕微與得病時間的短暫所致，也有因爲許多副的徵象的存在把病的主要徵象在愛克司光檢查時埋沒了，所以在很多的塲合，愛克司光檢查的結果祗能認爲一種臨床方面的參考，像別的實騐室方法一樣，而不能認作爲一種診斷，不過如若這種結果非常明確的時候，或者檢查的人很有經騐而能自信的時候，這就等於，一個完善，獨立的診斷也無不可。</p>
<p>也有人懷疑，在胃部檢查時，所受的愛克司光的量，會對於身體有什麽害處沒有？這個回答可以依據現代的知識否定的，普通所謂引起至少限度生物變化的愛克司光量在一個周密的胃部檢查中很難超過，也即是說這種思慮在平常的情况下是多餘的。</p>
<p>現在要說到有消化性潰瘍的病者爲什麽需要愛克司光檢騐了，第一當然要查查看潰瘍有沒有存在，如過證實了，那麽牠的地位，大小，深淺與數量都需要明瞭，其次要測知牠與胃作用的關連，消化的妨礙，胃排洩的阻塞，胃壁的黏着或者其他的一切，第二要分出這潰瘍還是屬於普通的一類抑或所謂惡性的一類，第三是關於治療方法的選揀了。即若在潰瘍治療的過程中，愛克司光的覆查也有其必要。確定治療之有效與否，這種覆查是很有助的。再有，在用過外科手術之後，胃部的檢查不單在臨床方法能得有力的參照，同時也可以及時作預防潰瘍再發的處置。</p>
<p>關於潰瘍的愛克司光的病象，最有確定性價値的，莫若「壁籠」這個徵象了。「壁蘢』這個影子是有病的一個器官，在牠的輪廓上有突出來的一小塊地方。這就是潰瘍本身被吃的藥鐵進去所發生的影子。這種「壁籠』的地位，大都處於胃的上沿，或者處於直接與胃相通的十二指腸尖端，偶然處於幽門上或者食道下端。雖然胃潰瘍本身遠比十二指腸潰瘍數目來得少，但「壁蘢』本身却比較容易在胃部找尋。不過不是每個潰瘍患者都很容易的顯示這個重要的徵象，所以有時必需依賴別的徵象而能確定診斷了。這裏暫時略而不詳。</p>
<p>現在要講到有什麽時候不能舉行胃部檢查的事了。有的時候胃部檢騐是不相宜的，或者應該延遲的。譬如，胃部流血之後，檢查時的摩撫有引起再度流血的可能。也有時潰瘍快洞穿了，那麽檢查時的手術或許也能引起不良的後果。</p>

<p>— 甘笑</p>
<p>二十世紀該是「人定勝天」的時代了，然而我們日常許許多多地方，老是「困極而呼天」。</p>
<p>這次我由漢口來，由江到江，本來是一條極平穩的水路，我却好幾次呼天；而且在平安抵家之後，也還鄕下老太婆似的感覺着是「上天保佑」。</p>
<p>拿錢買船票是最簡單的事，但我還是呼了天。我到漢口的那天，江岸靠着好幾條船，貨物旅客，都已吐得一乾二凈。可是較大的是屬於國營招商局，已被派爲「差船」。較小的是民營公司的船隻，正式售票的時間僅止一口氣數得出的幾分鐘，其勢不得不走黑市。而一位在船公司服務的朋友，數出一大堆黑市票的不穩妥處，這又使得我畏法的老百姓不得不謹愼退縮。「明人不做暗事」，我順從朋友的勸吿，等待「自市」票的到手。結果等等之又等，棧房裏的老鼠和臭虱放肆夾攻，我急的頭髮發白，堅決主張獻給「黑」吃；才以一倍半的代價，買來「固統」（有舖位的統艙）的三等票，頭二等票自然是輸下到了。</p>
<p>我坐的這條船，資格可不算漢：高齡五十三了！踏上甲板來，脚底沾搭搭的，表示是飽經烟　，不是　出茅蘆的白皮嫩肉。戲重據說是五百噸左右，在漢口裝了三四百噸貨物，四五百個旅客；旅客多半是復員的軍政人員，箱籠雜物左擁右抱，船身可說是相當充實的了。頭二等客人爲數不多，大都是三等「固統」與四等「活統」。這兩等人統統要塞在這魚腸裏面，怎能叫人不呼天啊！</p>
<p>「固統」的舖位分上下二層，我的是在下層。側着身子把被包打開舖好，把幾件小行李安放脚下；爲减少擁擠起見，脫了皮鞋鑽到被窩裏去。接着吵鬧聲一陣陣傳來，大致是賽人的行李過多，茶房竭力阻擋之類。茶房有甚麼用呢？他們又沒有草綠色衣服和領章；於是「固統」成了變相的行李間，甚麼氣窗南道，都被行李阻塞不通。而最妙的是我的「頭上人」：他們大小共十一位，買的祗是四個上層鋪位；兩個舖位準備坐人；兩個舖位準鋪擺那二十五六件行李！當他們把六支上了刺刀的步槍放下，茶房就都閉了嘴站得遠遠，縮籠雜物便一件件搬來。我仰着睡看上面看得十分明白：放行李鋪位漸漸歪斜，唯一的橫擋漸漸彎曲，我知道那下面的兩個　頭睡了的女客，臨到了萬分危險，不由得站起來抗議，我說：</p>
<p>「這裏不是行李李間，大家都這樣拿行李塞進來，空氣會完全被擠出去的。而且這種薄板上放這些行李，上頭的舖位要坍下來，壓死了人誰負責任」？</p>
<p>嘿！他們的顯目挺身出來了，胸部一拍：「我負責，我是旅長」！他把他的少將階級的領章一指。哦！旅長！我心襄想：「旅長是天上掉下來的，管甚麼壓死人不壓死人」？這樣想的常中，橫擋果然斷了，若不是下面女客的鋪位上也有箱餽，她們兩個怕英要考騐考騐旅長的「負責」了。我不知怎麼一來，重重地在那旋長的肩上敲了一下，沒有說話，祗捺了電簡呌他看那根斷了的橫檔。他這會兒氣焰稍爲低點，指揮他的土兵：「行李搬下來！要出命案了」！於是他的全部的行李都塞在過遭，四個舖位光祇睡十一個人丁，我們「下層人」得免於壓死的浩劫，不得不謝天謝地！</p>
<p>第二天早晨　到了女厠所的地方：沿着船尾走到廚房，由廚房走下抉梯，穿過活統的舖位，右手拐彎便是。打開那扇短門，裏面的情形不堪萬目：顯上是便溺直淌；脚下是無處立錐。天哪十六七世紀大西洋上的「黑奴船」，怕就是這個光景罷？</p>
<p>爬上扶梯，一堆人蹲着堵住了去路，俯身一看，他們都是雙手在地板上捧飯。一　飯被倒翻了，白飯拌上了沾脚底的黑漿，倒像是猪汕芝蔴湯團心子；天哪！這是他們準備給三四等賽人　的哩！</p>
<p>想轉到甲板上透口氣，可是這條船壓根兒沒有甲板，一眼望去，全是如山的柴板！「活統」的朋友個個都學勾踐的臥薪，把柴板常了舖位。柴板之外，鷄蛋，鴨蛋，鹹魚醃肉，不知有幾十百籮。找了一個老茶房一問，才知這是船上的賬房和茶房的私貨。我問他私貨爲甚麼可以帶這許多？他皺起眉毛苦笑地說：「不帶又有甚麼辦法？我們一共卅五個茶房，沒有一個大錢的薪水，船上祗供給一口白飯，家裏各人還有孩子老婆。客人現在多半是軍人，茶費小賑撈撈不到手，不帶私貨有甚麼辦法？現在是瞞上不瞞下，除了公司的大老板之外，船上的賬房間，彼此是一氣的。賑房間有薪水，而且還可以船上賣賣舖位；但他們帶的私貨，祗有比我們更多」。我不能估計他們的私貨有多少重量，但當我伸出頭往下一看，平靜的江水已經和船舷差不多相齊，若有小小的波浪，就可以打進氣窗。這條高年的小船，牠眞是要危乎其殆。</p>
<p>先師敎人「不立於危墻之下」，我們現在被裝在危船之上，四顧江水茫茫，除了暗地呼天，還有甚麼安心的辦法？</p>
<p>過了大通，中夜忽然拋錨，大家紛紛問茶房。老茶房解說道；「有霧呀！天上落霧了。船上薪水低；領港是沒有經騐的毛脚蟹，這呌做瞎眼不嫌蹺脚，蹺脚不嫌瞎眼，就彼此將就將就了。這種時候，能小心點停下來，總算好的」。天啊，拋錨總算好的！否則我們要犧牲在他們的「瞎」與「蹺」了！</p>
<p>將近江陰，　又拋錨了，性急的船客都跳　起來，那個老茶房又來解釋了：「客人你們着急，我們的領港比你們還急，他家裏明天晚上有喜事。沒得法子呀！船快要到「拋錨沙」，天黑了，霧又重，怎麼走法？別人外國船還要當心。還說我們的「老爺船」！有幾個客人間他：「甚麼呌「拋錨沙」？「拋錨沙」？「拋錨沙」就是怪氣！就是妖孽！半晚上合將攏萊，船走到就擱淺了，天亮了沙沉下去，船也就一道吸下去。從前有條法國船，在道地方擱淺了，以爲不要緊，到天亮被妖怪吸掉了。祇有東洋人在這的時候，妖怪也怕了他們，從來不出現」。妖怪眞怕東洋人麼？想來多幾個燈塔罷了！</p>
<p>拋錨了兩個鐘頭，機輪又喘喘地發動。霧一層層加重，江岸藏得無影無踪。汽笛每隔兩分鐘長呌一聲，聲聲的長呌竟像野獸垂死的哀號，好不呌人心亂！老茶房獨白似的在發牢騷：「尋死！這樣的霧也開船！走得過領港一個人好做新郞，走不過五百人一同好見閻王！」夜深一盞半明的油燈搖搖幌幌，橫七豎八的臥客活像死屍，茶房的怨語與哀號的汽笛交響，令人毛髮悚然，彷彿閻王正在招手似的。</p>
<p>好容易天已大明太陽有破雲撥霧之勢，江岸雖然還是看不見，汽笛越來越叫得稀了。再過了幾小時，總算把我們送到了黃浦江岸。當我們踏到岸上時，更生的慶幸，如同登了天堂。</p>
<p>江上是這麼暗無天日，二十世紀江上行，各人還祗靠靑天，誰願意生在此時此地呢？</p>

<p>從遼遠的北國來的人，除了還殘存着一些風雪漫天中爐邊的溫暖記憶外，他們不是都學會了在那急管繁弦的帷帳邊線騙取着溫情的誓語？</p>
<p>還有那從南方踡伏到道都市裏來的人們，碧海雲天的迫慕和戀留已經淡却，許多惹人駐足的角落裏，地們不也是正在把歡樂的心音譜出了使人感到迷惘的旋律？</p>
<p>有誰懂得哀怨？有誰懂得憤怒？大家不都是在用自已的手匆促而又糊塗的製作着嘲弄我們人生的事物麼’</p>
<p>我無可奈何地一遍又一遍的跑過這都市的每一個角落，養良者的控訴被室息得快要滅絕了！到處都存在着對社會的傷害！對人性的壓榨！</p>
<p>沒有故事，沒有時篇，是一頁可悲的空白！</p>
<p>道原是一泓無底的濁流啊！</p>
<p>我漸漸地忘却了高歌和狂喊，我慢慢地壓會了人生的世故和僞裝；我接受了社會制度的贊賞與縱容，我也嘗到了人世閒的惆悵和悽愴。我變成了一粒在濁流中浮動的渣滓，渣滓是永遠不會，也不能，使濁流激湧起漣漪來的！</p>
<p>鮮明而倔强的行程已不復親切，心頭殘留着一片可恥的空虛。</p>
<p>這給與妳的失望是必然的。</p>
<p>但是，我已經够倦意的了。</p>
<p>是的，一年了，正是今天。這都市裏的人們並沒萎縮了例有的狂歡，蕭索的歌聲仍舊在揚溢，翠線的栢枝和葛蘿掩映着燭淚中的火熖，這些，都深深地喚起了我的懷念。</p>
<p>用懺悔來洗掉，我這一年中的荒怠與蹉跎吧！縱然這都市加諸於我的是殘酷，是辛酸，但還有明年，還有那麼一段可貴的歲月，……我還有一具沒有感染到庸俗和沒落氣息的靈魂！</p>
<p>我在枕邊默聯了，對着蠟炬。妳該想像到我這時候的情懷。</p>
<p>囂沸的塵寰又將恢復了吧？窗外的寒風呼號着。</p>
<p>妳應該祝福它的，這都市未來的新生！</p>
<p>是夢回的時候。</p>
<p>卅五年，冬至前夕。</p>

<p>「噢」！鶴見第一次感覺到起了眞的的恐怖，「那麼，這些號碼又是從那裏弄的呢」？</p>
<p>「那大槪是早一年的事」？</p>
<p>「什麼」？鶴見又以爲聽錯了。</p>
<p>「你知道我們也有一套機器，一年前常常收到這種特殊密碼可不大注意。近一年來，聽得多了，靑木老師，費了一些事，把號碼恭鍵。索隱出來，……可是你用不着躭心，到現在爲止，只有他老人家一人，可以解譯，但還要很費心思，他不願竣表，也不肯多弄，他不願耗費精神，地說他還要活下去」。</p>
<p>「啊」鶴見聽到這裹，才覺一塊石頭落地，「萍子，我還有一句話，我幹的事，這樣困難，他老人家旣說也有人在進行，這是挽救無數萬生命的善行，他老人家爲什麼……」</p>
<p>「爲什麼小把那東西找出來」？萍子替鶴見把話接了下去，「何嘗不想把東西找到，無奈找不着收藏的地點」。</p>
<p>「爲什麼不用玄術」？</p>
<p>「大哥你說你，也學過玄術，怎麼說這樣外行話」？</p>
<p>「難這不能對那收藏人行術」？</p>
<p>「沒有媒介哪」。</p>
<p>「你不是現成的媒介」？</p>
<p>「我同那老傢伙毫無感情，怎麼可以做媒介」？萍子有些生氣了。</p>
<p>「唉」！鶴見失望了，「那麼，我們再見哪」！</p>
<p>「再見，大哥，一定再見，至少有三次；末次再見，聽說很長期哩」！萍子笑格格地把電話掛上了。</p>
<p>鶴見一腔心事，沒有十分注意萍子「長期」的涵義，也不願再同她　唆下去了。晚上的進行計劃，雖說經了這電話的一番打攪，大家覺得，事情已到這步階段，已如箭在弦上，不得不發；况日萍子的話，他們都有些將信將疑咧。</p>
<p>晚上九點鐘正，鶴見已經端端正正，坐在　軍軍用機「長勝」號裏了。同行共有七八個人，除鸛見外，都是赴華北的現役上級軍官。但在飛機起飛的前半小時，東京各晚報的第二次增刋，前綫消息　導之外，都刋登着一封神秘的短簡，題名「對鶴見王挑戰神秘敵手」，文中寫着：「鶴見玉君：久慕閣下，其男兒好身手，今際遇風雲：首相亦寵以奇眼；飛黃騰達，蹺足可待。惟同人等，雖村同下駟，不干　代，有所建白，妄擬稍索代價；劍柔，雨道，任賜一二手，足矣。晚十一時左右，「別府」專誠奉候。絲野社同人拜手」。</p>
<p>當日谷晚報，都把這事，當作新鮮炎料。各報主筆，刋出這封神秘短簡之後，還附了幾句感想：有的說，「因何同室操戈」？也有的說，「江戶十五世紀俠客作風，重見今日」！又有什麼「俠盜　　向福爾　斯之挑戰，必有好戲可看」？還有的說，「軍人爲國效忠，自應竭其所長，並非邀功，何必妬嫉？旣覺不憤，理應光明正大，挺身而生，在大衆前一較短長，不較勝於鬼鬼崇崇之技倆耶」等等。</p>
<p>飛機事面，八個行人，就有五六個各買了幾份第二次增刋；報雖不同，恰第刋着這封短簡，並且說明鶴見乘的這架「畏勝」號。七個人雖不認識鶴見，當然猜想得出；因爲他們是一個團組，鶴見則是孤身一人。</p>

<p>— 品白華</p>
<p>喚起王維畫不成</p>
<p>我該可以自傲，我的生長地有着「名山」，中國是多山的國家，不過，山要淸與秀，才成其爲名。那麼，千載以上謫仙李太白「自愛名山入剡中」的一句詩，並不是歪曲的；而同時，他還夢游過天姥山，所謂「一萬八千尺」的謫仙夢遊處，就在我的故鄉之東。但一件事往往結果會相反的，對於生長地故鄉的名山，十多年了，惜繼之情掩沒了自倣成分，因爲我早成了一個「東西南北之人」，沒有「騎款段乘下澤車爲鄕里善人」的福份。</p>
<p>然而，我終於歸來了，「淸風嶺」一過，剡溪像一條平練，迴環着峻邈的山峯，白雲，是山靈的外衣吧！它那麼自在地飄盪過一個山峯，一個山峯，　葱的樹林掩映出幾家白板屋，吿訴我午這裏面是一派的天然懷抱沒有染上都市的機心的。我想，這不但招引謫仙的詩意，而是一幅很好的畫，但好得太天然了，除非「畫中有詩」的王摩結來一幅「剡中圖」，豈不比「山谷鬱盤雲勢飛動」的「軸川圖」更好？</p>
<p>小包車在嵊縣停了，我知宗恩趁轉車的餘眼，去看了一下「聽　亭，」不過一塊土邱，述蔓着野草，在這樣地方有幾個人能「雙柑斗酒」去學戴安道呢！自然，深秋了，那兒尋得到黃鸚？就在對草業邊兜了一個圈子，我們上了開新昌的汽車，嵊新的相距只四十里，車厢中充滿鄉音，可是十多年關別的我，連鄕音也改了，鬢毛更不必說。尤其是一件布衣，誰還認得你？我於是踡伏着，怕聽鄉音。漸漸，古老的故鄕山城在望了，我拉宗恩跳下車，揀城脚跟的僻路走，不願讓「江東父老」發現這歸故鄕的還老樣一個窮小子。</p>
<p>夜了，故鄉沒有電燈，我記得在從前，這一點都市之賜是有的，大概「復原」不容易吧！這樣，一到夜，全地便墨黑，加上刦火中街道連民房燬去了十之七八，一片元礫，雖然。帶了「燈籠」走，還是很難找得着路逕。我的三間老屋，則「符其實」的變了屋嚴，裏面什麼東西都沒有了，我臨時下榻出參議會空舍。</p>
<p>一連幾天，叨了宗恩的光，吃飯不發生問題，因爲早晚都有着人請客的。然而我討厭，送來的帖子居然跟着「陳視察」後頭寫着「呂教授」字樣，斗大的山城而且公務人員最多三四萬元一月，縣長也不過十萬，排場，應酬，居然十分地都市化。</p>

<p>— 少夫</p>
<p>聖誕之日，有三雙飛機先後在上海失事，死傷七十餘人，這幕慘劇發生在這一佳節，誠勝不幸！</p>
<p>失事的原因，是由於濃霧，飛機無法辨認機塲，以致罹難。事後檢查殘機機骸，無一起火焚燬跡象，足以證明各機在上海市空盤旋甚久，油已燃盡，迫不獲已，惟有强行降落。這一天，僅有中國公司第147號一機，意外地幸運，得以强迫降落江灣機塲，略受損傷，機中人員徼倖無恙。</p>
<p>宿命論渚也許會張大其詞，曰：死生有數。其實，這個不幸雖曰上天不測風雲（濃霧），歸咎於氣候之變化，但善盡人力，仍是可以避免的。我們記得中國飛剪號，試飛太平洋航綫時，正遭遇到太平洋上的暴風雨，倘使不是完善的飛航設備，決不能順利完成這一飛行。濃霧固然是一大飛行的障害，如果用無綫電指導方向，如果地面的指示着陸設備（用光綫或聲音）完善，濃霧又何能影響安全？</p>
<p>今年這一年，飛行失事的紀錄，實在不能算少了，長此以往，難免令一般人們對於空中旅行不發生戒心，航空公司及交通當局是否應該仔細研討一下，對於一切設備及各種負責人員（包括駕駛，電信及地面人員）加以考核一番，庶可防患於未然。因爲人命關天，是決不能有所疏忽的。求盡善盡美，這不僅是給旅客以保障，更是對於中國航空事業的前途作至大的貢獻。</p>
<h3 id="c201">歲暮贅語 <a href="#c201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>— 慈壽</p>
<p>「漲風」，「打風」，「搶風」，「倒風」，「大風起兮，百姓遭殃！」</p>
<p>民國卅五年即將過去，當我們迎卅六年光臨之前，不妨對今年這一年檢討一番。我想來想去，拿不出一個好的名詞來贈送給這一年，還是來給它一個「綽號」，稱這一年爲「多風年」。</p>
<p>近來天氣雖冷，可是外面的風並不算多，何以要稱它「多風年」呢，莫非我在掀風作浪麼？不錯，風的含義却是很廣；我所說的風，旣不是東南風，也不是西北風，而是指今年的「漲風」「打風」，「搶屬」，與「倒風」呵。</p>
<p>失脫「漲風」。每當一次漲風侵襲過來的時侯，人們就像昏迷的一樣，不知所措。等到漲風過去了，才甦醒過來，透一口氣。可是好景不常，第二次漲風却變本加厲的接踵而來，又使人們重入昏迷狀態。小百姓們就在這種循環不已的漲風裏度日子，眞不知物價要漲到那一天爲止呢？</p>
<p>再說「打風」。無論你在戲院裏，或是在球塲上，都可以看到這種風，源源不絕約有人在導演着。我不知道人性爲什麼變得這樣暴躁，一言不合就動手，打得落花流水，打得頭破血流，都是「像煞嘸介事」，樂得給人家着好看呀。</p>
<p>第三是「搶風」。這個年頭，生活不得解決，挺而走險的人不在少數，搶風也愈來愈熾。但是搶法各有巧妙不同，「强盜土匪」們在明搶，污官奸商們在暗搶。明搶的人倒說是生活不得解決而搶，暗搶的「人」又不知是爲了什麼？搶黃金，搶美鈔，搶物資，搶得不亦樂乎，無論怎樣槍法，反止私襄是不會像通貨那樣「膨脤」的搶得多用得多，互為因果，搶無止境！</p>
<p>最後說「倒風」這似乎是「壓台戲」，年關來臨，倒風盛行</p>
<h3 id="c202">福建主席劉建緒 <a href="#c202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>— 甘來</p>
<p>現任福建省主席劉建緒，保定陸軍軍官學校第三期　兵科畢業，離校後，歷任軍職，從排長遞升至集團軍總司令和第三戰區副司令長官。他在民國十七年以後，負責湘贛邊境的綏靖工作，迭奏摧毀廓淸之效，極得上峯嘉許。抗戰期內，馳驅東南戰塲，杭州彎一役，攻克鎭海，浙省局勢頓以轉危爲安。後縱陳儀就閩省主席，沿海失地隨即以次收復。他爲政始終恪守「三分軍事，七分政治」的原則，福建局面的漸見寗定，說明他的施政確已部份收效。</p>
<p>今年三月中旬，劉氏曾過滬，並假金門飯店邀宴福建旅滬同鄕。他本人是湖南醴陵人，面孔胖胖圓圖，格外顯出他的飽滿精神。</p>
<p>劉氏的元配陳氏，育有十三女五，一家人凑滿十個兒的齊頭整數。</p>
<p>他治家非常嚴肅，不許家人穿着奇裝異服，對於賭博，允爲深惡痛絕，並以此用作轉誠見女們。</p>
<p>福建自廿五年以來，人民飽受天災人禍及貪污剝削，現在正需要蘇息復員，人民無不深望劉主席勵精圖治，安定民生！</p>
<h3 id="c203">烽火連天中　世外有桃源 <a href="#c203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>隨着勝利而來的房荒，直到現在這個嚴重問題，還是無法解決。當局似乎也曾動過一番腦筋，計劃書是一份又一份，住宅區，平民邨，這些永遠是紙上談兵</p>
<p>最近被我「哥崙布」發現新大陸般地瞧到了一處貨眞價實的「平民邨」。在那裏呢？地點就在「西站」以及「新龍華」一帶，這裏的居民，彷彿是「桃花源記」中那般與世無爭，日出而作，日入而息。</p>
<p>這裏本來是荒地，可是現在，商店老闆呌苦，工廠主人嘆窮，都說年關難過，而且過了一關還有一關。這幾天來，他們大有「度日如年」之感，天天好比「大年夜」。我想，要不是從根本上去十着想安安定統一，任憑你拿出什麼賢明的辦法來，都抵擋不住這種倒風。</p>
<p>倒屬之後該又是什麼風，我不得而知。總之，今年是「多風年」。老實說，我們小百姓們，對這種年頭並不留戀；我們唯一的希望，是明年能够「風調雨順，國泰民安」，不再呌我們小百姓們受苦受難！</p>
<p>早已成爲新興的「平民村」了，新建的房屋，雖不是立體式的紅瓦火磚，不過　次櫛比的非常整齊，而且家家是獨門獨戶，住得十分自由而舒服，有臥室，灶間，客堂，門外的空地上種些荳麥蔬菜和葱菲之類，雖然沒有自來水，但，鑿池而飲，倒也不成問題，幷且每份人家蓄養些鷄·鴨·猪·羊。因此過年的菜餚，也許薪水階級的上海人，還沒這樣的豐富。</p>
<p>據親這裏的房屋是不用化「金條」頂的，都是蘇北同胞自己動手蓋搭，所需建築的材料，是由別處瓦礫塲所去搬來。老貿說，一毛不拔而住得那麼的舒服，也不用着二房東的險嘴，更母需化房錢，「捐稅」與他們是風馬一牛，雖然地主曾向他們交涉過，但這些蘇北同胞確是無處容身，常言道，只有這屋留人住，沒有拆屋趕人動身的，何况惻隱之心，人皆有之！</p>
<p>這個新興的「平民村」裏，也有若干家村店·烟紙店·小茶館·理髮店·搶餅攤，正是麻雀雖小，王臟俱全。</p>
<p>我從這裏看出了江北人的自立精神，江北同胞個個能刻苦耐勞，沒有依賴性，處處地方可以「不求人」過生活。小孩子們已懂得「拾荒」和賣茶而能不靠父母吃喝，所以我認爲江北人是很足效法的。</p>

<p>賣藝求乞　（中）</p>
<p>（六）「眞假啞」——啞子是殘麽之一種，丐流也利用作爲乞憐的法宝。但有價假之分，其行業分爲四種。計爲「　天」，「呌口」，「當路」，「行實」。「瞞天」是貨眞價實的啞子，「呌口」却是習牌貨。本來開充啞十是最容易的勾當，其呌化分爲「當路』「行街」兩派。分道揚　，各不相犯。「當路」是跪路旁磕響頭，口中念念有詞，手指着天地，再指着自己的口和心，拍拍胸口求乞。「行街」是挨戶求乞。假啞十在求乞時相聚，向例不許談天，須回「御香堂」（丐廠）後才許開口。</p>
<p>（七）「鼻觀音」——此幫須足穿草娃，頭束草圈。「雙龍入海」是用毛竹削成兩根長應子，端懸絨球。求乞時將竹　揰沒到鼻孔裏，露絨球在外。「眞龍口」就是弄蛇穿鼻。兩派都是「一鼻孔出氣」。</p>
<p>（八）「坐他　」——四胶幾廠，坐路旁狂　·其　日：「好腳好手天堂路，壞腳壞手地獄門。明中去，暗中來，一錢不落虛空地。」歌聲抑揚頓挫，使人聞而生憐。</p>
<p>（九）「賣挖耳」——沿街售賣竹製挖耳的是丐幫的另一支派。幫中自稱「捧紗帽」，不知何所取義。但業此者都不肯自己承認是乞丐。大槪爲進進款不壞，巳經擠身於小販之列了。據說須能够右手捧着紗帽，左手能够單獨運刀製造，才算是看家本領。</p>
<p>（十）「苦肉刀」——本帮分「攔腰」「圍塲」兩種。攔腰丐上街時須先着上身，提着二尺來長的戒刀。不給錢時便在腰間硬擊，新起了一道道的紅痕。使店家又驚又憐，給錢了事。「圍塲」和江湖賣藝大同小晨，在路旁荒地弄一個　塲，向人求討。不過此輩並無江湖帮的好技藝，只是鑄茲亂敲一番，騙騙閒雜人等而已。</p>
<p>（十一）「舞光棍」——與上項同屬江湖賣藝的流亞，但爲江湖帮所不齒。一種稱「齊屬」，能將木棍舞得五花八門，一種稱「打光棍」，是用的三根短棍，一粗二細，沿街舞弄呌化。</p>
<p>（十二）「眞假　」——有價價啞子自有價假瞎子、而且假瞎子反多於眞瞎子。冒牌貨帮中稱爲「冷看」，亦妙喻也。手裏拿着竹桿，眼皮外翻，黑珠裏藏，虧他們還懂得化妝術。叫街的詞句有云：「抬頭不見天堂路，舉足不見路高低。」類此不能盡記了。「爛麗」坐乞也是屬於本帮的。表面上雖是瘡痍滿目，陳列路旁展覽。其實多數是利用丐帮祖傳的化妝術。此外還有跪在路旁　着響頭的，把前額磕成胡桃般巨塊的。也屬於本帮，待復詳述之。</p>

<p>現在抗戰勝利，勝利已一年多了，國事該漸入於正軌了，國家前途的光明，是近於燦爛光輝的境地了，商塲呢？經政府的指導，督促，不久當然是風平浪靜，日盛一日，民衆呢？經過這長期抗戰勝利後，更當然要發奮，圖強，作一個新民，我王小二當此舉國歡騰迎接三十六年的時候，我正式向國人告別，永遠告別，深願從此社會上沒有我這王小二，更願從此社會上碰到事情弄不好，莫再用我王小二解嘲。」</p>

<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 26th] Following the conclusion of the National Assembly, the reorganization of the government has become a major issue of national concern. It is learned that the government is currently in consultation with various party figures. The National Government and the Executive Yuan will be reorganized simultaneously. The People's Political Council, the Legislative Yuan, and the Supervisory Yuan will also increase the number of committee members within the shortest possible time. However, the rumor that the number of legislators will be increased to 500 is unreliable. Furthermore, according to relevant personnel from the Legislative Yuan, the Legislative Yuan will have to draft many legal items within three months after the closing of the National Assembly, and these matters are of great importance.

<p>[Our Dispatch] Sun Baoyi, spokesman for the Democratic Socialist Party, told reporters that the Democratic League's request for the Democratic Socialist Party to withdraw from the League was expected long ago. The Democratic Socialist Party is an independent political party, and at the beginning of its establishment, it stated that if the Democratic League has any major decisions, it must obtain the consent of the Democratic Socialist Party. At that time, the Democratic League did not have any reaction, which can be regarded as tacit consent. And the Democratic Socialist Party's decisions do not have any obligation to seek the consent of the Democratic League in advance. Since the convening of the National Assembly, the Democratic League has not held a meeting to decide not to participate in the National Assembly, and this point is particularly noteworthy. Sun said that there are only about twenty people in the Democratic Socialist Party who participated in the Democratic League. How these twenty people will deal with themselves in the future will be a matter of concern, but the Democratic League is not a political party, so in fact there is no such thing as cross-party affiliation. Sun emphasized that the Democratic Socialist Party will never split, and said that after the Democratic League made this decision, the promotion of the party's affairs may be more convenient than before. The reporter then asked if the Democratic Socialist Party would still cooperate with the Democratic League if peace talks were reopened in the future. Sun replied that the meaning of the Democratic League's decision this time is non-cooperation within the League, but cooperation can still be done outside the League.</p>

<h3 id="e24">Shanghai Soviet Overseas Chinese Clash with US Military Police; Soviet Union Lodges Protest with United States; Reportedly, US Soldiers Drank and Caused Accidents <a href="#e24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Moscow, 25th] Regarding the conflict between US military police and Soviet citizens Martinov and Qiucha in Shanghai in September, Radio Moscow, citing TASS, reported that the Soviet Embassy in the United States has lodged a protest with the US State Department and urged it to pay attention to the matter. In September, an American soldier, while driving drunk in Shanghai, crashed into a car driven by Soviet citizen Martinov. Martinov immediately asked the American soldier to go to the police station together, but the American soldier refused and punched Martinov. At that time, about 20 American military police officers rushed to the scene and beat Martinov and his friend Qiucha. Martinov suffered head injuries, and his arms and legs were also beaten and injured. After the incident, the Soviet Consul General in Shanghai wrote to the US Consul General in Shanghai, Davis, but has not received a reply. US Army Commander Lieutenant General Gillen issued a report blaming the conflict on Soviet citizens Martinov and Qiucha. The Soviet government, in view of this situation, instructed its embassy in the United States to lodge a protest with the US State Department.</p>
<h3 id="e25">American Newspapers Continue to Accuse the Soviet Union, Believing the Dalian Incident is a "Test" of Relations Between the Two Countries <a href="#e25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 25th] Washington Post columnist Novotny elaborated on the Dalian incident on the 24th as a "test" of Soviet relations. Novotny warned that "the direct encounter between the United States and the Soviet Union in China is more than anywhere else in the world." The article pointed out that if the Soviet Union's policy in China continues to be perverse, the promotion of closer relations with the Soviet Union by the United States will become a bubble. Although the Soviet Union has expressed its friendly attitude at the United Nations General Assembly, its questionable position in China has aroused the concern of the world.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 25th] The Scripps-Howard chain's World Telegram reported on the Dalian incident again today in an editorial, accusing the Soviet Union of being untrustworthy. It said that if the Soviet Union does not have good credibility, then the talks on concluding new treaties will also be in vain. The newspaper said that the Sino-Soviet Friendship Treaty originally stipulated that Dalian was a free port, but the control of the city and port of Dalian by the Red Army has at least made all the practical purposes of the treaty destroyed by unilateral actions. The Soviet Union's actions to abolish or change the agreement seem to be only for Soviet diplomacy and have not been consulted with the other contracting party and other parties related to the agreement. The newspaper said that even if the Soviet Union signs some parts of the treaty that are currently being negotiated, its value is still questionable. If the Soviet Union does not have good credibility, then this kind of negotiation will also be in vain. The newspaper also disclosed a cartoon on the same page as the editorial, titled "Free Port".</p>

<h3 id="e34">Looking at the Far East from the World <a href="#e34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>The successful conclusion of both the Foreign Ministers' Conference and the United Nations General Assembly has not only given the turbulent and uneasy year of 1946 a peaceful ending internationally, but also opened up a beautiful prospect for international politics in 1947. From now on, mankind can better believe that although the peace it has longed for day and night is still very far away, this common aspiration of mankind will eventually be realized. Therefore, the speeches delivered by politicians and diplomats of various countries to their respective peoples on Christmas expressed optimism and joy about the world of tomorrow. Santa Claus brought the gospel of peace, which is truly inspiring, and even the people in war-torn countries felt infinite warmth.</p>
<p>However, when looking at the situation in the Far East from the perspective of the world situation, a heavy and bleak shadow suddenly casts on everyone's heart; the Far East can be said to be the most fragile link in world politics; before the world experienced turmoil, it was already in the midst of raging flames of war; after all countries in the world can live in peace, there is still no hope for the flames of war in the Far East to be extinguished. Needless to mention the civil war in China, Indonesia first raised the banner of national liberation and engaged in a deadly struggle with the Dutch garrison. The bloodshed has lasted for more than a year, and only a draft of an Indonesian-Dutch agreement has been established so far, which has not yet been approved by both parties. Secondly, there is Vietnam. Under the leadership of President Ho Chi Minh of the Viet Minh Republic, they originally wanted to achieve Vietnam's independence and autonomy through peaceful understanding. In order to achieve this goal, he personally went to Paris to conclude the French-Vietnamese Treaty with the French authorities to promote French-Vietnamese relations and seek the happiness of both parties; however, the French High Commissioner in Vietnam, Vice Admiral d'Argenlieu, never shed the past French attitude towards the Vietnamese people, which aroused the anger of the Vietnamese people and created the current turbulent situation. France is now under the rule of Socialist leader Blum, and there may be changes in the policies and attitudes it should adopt towards Vietnam; otherwise, the situation in Vietnam will inevitably deteriorate and it is unknown what kind of tragic situation it will create! Furthermore, for India and Burma, although the British Labor cabinet announced India's independence at the beginning of this year, and Prime Minister Attlee recently announced Burma's independence, the Indian internal affairs experienced the Indian-Muslim dispute. The Muslim League has always insisted on the proposition of Indian-Muslim partition and refused to participate in the Indian interim government, also adopting a bystander attitude towards the Indian Constitutional Assembly. Although Britain wants to mediate, the London British-Indian-Muslim tripartite round table conference has not achieved any results. The Muslim League has taken destructive actions everywhere in India, plunging India into a state of terror. Even though Mahatma Gandhi tried to persuade them with a hunger strike, it did not work. As for Burma, there is still a long way to go before true independence.</p>
<p>As the actual situation in Asia is as described above, the relations between the major powers in Asia have not yet been fully clarified. In particular, the positions that the United States and the Soviet Union should adopt on the Far East issue are still in an uncertain state. Since the United States and the Soviet Union can understand each other on certain world issues, it stands to reason that it is not difficult to reach a compromise on the Far East issue. But what is the actual situation? It is difficult to say. For example, on the issue of Japanese reparations, the opinions of the United States and the Soviet Union are completely different. How to reconcile and reach a compromise is a very difficult problem. Moreover, the Soviet Union has always expressed dissatisfaction with the US policy of controlling Japan. Secondly, the unification of Korea is also an urgent matter, to merge the US and Soviet occupied zones, otherwise, Korea will be artificially dismembered into two parts. Not only will the blood circulation be unable to flow smoothly, but also the pain of deep division will certainly not be able to discuss the issue of revival. Furthermore, there is the issue of Northeast China. The Soviet Union transported so much industrial equipment, which in the Soviet Union's view, is called war booty, and the reason for its removal is very sufficient; but in the United States' view, it believes that this is not war booty, but should be used as Japanese reparations. The two sides stick to their own words, and no conclusion has been reached so far. Recently, the Dalian incident suddenly occurred. Although the American public opinion circles attached great importance to this, the American authorities, in order to avoid the deterioration of US-Soviet relations, expressed indifference and hoped that China and the Soviet Union would directly negotiate a solution. The US State Department's ability to take the overall situation into consideration and not focus on small things is a wise approach. However, the Soviet authorities are still haggling over small things with the United States. For example, the conflict between Soviet citizens and US military police in Shanghai a few months ago was originally a very trivial matter, but the Soviet diplomatic authorities made a big fuss about it, and the Soviet ambassador to the United States even lodged a protest with the US State Department, which makes us ultimately feel that the Soviet authorities do not cherish the opportunity to improve US-Soviet relations very much, which cannot but be regretted.</p>
<p>In short, when looking at the Far East from the perspective of the world, although the Far East is still before dawn, mankind is progressing. Especially after the Second World War, its progress will be even faster. The flames of war in Vietnam and the East Indies are enough to prove that the era of imperialism has come to an end. At the same time, judging from various factors, especially President Truman's recent declaration on China, which reiterated that the declaration on China issued on December 15 last year remains effective, it is truly believable that the situation in the Far East also has the hope of improving with the improvement of the overall world situation.</p>

<h3 id="e36">Guangdong's Five-Year Construction Plan, Detailed Plan Formulated, Divided into Three Departments, 24 Categories, and 82 Items <a href="#e36" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c36" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">36</a></h3>
<p>[Our newspaper Guangzhou News] The long-rumored Guangdong Five-Year Construction Plan, after many inquiries by our reporter, has been briefly learned. It is found that the plan was decided by Chairman Luo Zhuoying at the beginning of the year, and Provincial Committee Member Huang Wenshan was appointed as the Director of the Five-Year Plan Drafting Committee. Li Yangjing, Xie Wenlong, Du Meihe, Bing Xun, Yao Binyou, and Luo Xianglin were appointed as Standing Committee Members. More than 90 experts, scholars, and responsible persons in charge of various departments were hired as drafting committee members. Well-known people in the province responded to the invitation to participate in collective creation, drafted construction plans for various categories, and appointed Lai Xiru, Deputy Director of the Provincial Design Assessment Committee, as the chief editor, and Liang Qianwu as the deputy chief editor. It took almost six months, with four revisions, and it was submitted to the Provincial Administrative Conference and the Provincial Senate for discussion. The entire plan will be announced soon, and the content is divided into three major departments: economic, cultural, and political, with 24 categories and 82 items.</p>
<p>Economy</p>
<p>The economic construction department focuses on laying the foundation for industrialization and solving the problem of self-sufficiency in food and clothing for the people. A total of more than 50 public factories, more than 90 farms, more than 40 fishing grounds, more than 20 mines, more than 30 power stations, and more than 40 water conservancy projects are planned to be built. The benefits in the final year can reach the point of sufficiently supplying the province's people and reducing the province's food shortage by 40% and clothing material by 30%.</p>
<p>Culture</p>
<p>The culture department focuses on eliminating illiteracy in the province and cultivating vocational and professional talents. A total of 43,968 national schools, 32 vocational schools, 103 normal schools, 103 middle schools, and 5 specialized schools are planned to be built, and 100 students will be trained to study abroad. The benefits in the final year can eliminate 80% of illiteracy in the province and reserve 60% of construction talents.</p>
<p>Politics</p>
<p>The political department focuses on implementing local autonomy and consolidating the foundation of constitutional government. It is divided into special chapters such as grassroots construction, police construction, financial construction, land administration construction, health construction, social construction, cooperative undertakings, and municipal construction, in order to establish the scale of modern politics. According to the person in charge of the committee, the plan is based on the central government's national policy and the principles of the material and cultural construction plan of the Central Design Bureau, and refers to the Soviet Union's Five-Year Plan and the American TVA system, as well as the actual situation in the province. The design of each project provides detailed planning for the past overview, the central business's annual progress, expected benefits, required funds, and talents.</p>
<p>Funds</p>
<p>The amount of funds is set at 600 million yuan in pre-war currency values. There are separate plans for fundraising methods, which are said to be being submitted to the central government for approval. According to our reporter's observation, Guangdong is a politically stable area, and its economy and funds have always been very active. If overseas Chinese capital can be utilized, idle funds can be absorbed, and this can be adhered to, then the achievements of construction in the future will not only enable Guangdong, the birthplace of the revolution, to enter a new stage of construction, but will also be of great benefit to the future of national construction.</p>

<p>[Our newspaper Suzhou, 26th] As an episode in the brawl and bloodshed case of the garrison in this city, the memorial service for the deceased veterans was originally scheduled to be held on the morning of the 26th, but it was temporarily postponed due to differences in opinions between the two sides. The Suzhou Provisional Senate, in view of the discord between the military, which is not a blessing for the local area, specially convened all parties concerned on the 27th to reconsider the follow-up measures in order to quickly seek mediation. The First Supply District Command of the Shanghai Joint Logistics Headquarters has specially sent Zhao Jianxin, the first section chief of the health department, to Suzhou to investigate and comfort the wounded soldiers.

<p>[Our newspaper Shaoxing News] The Shaoxing County Government has been instructed by the military control district command that this year's temporary conscription does not distinguish between levels. All able-bodied men from the age of 20 to 35 are able-bodied men of the appropriate age and have the obligation to perform military service. Therefore, the fourth Bao in Shangyu Township in the county raised funds to hire supported soldiers. Those who want to avoid being conscripted have to pay 20,000 yuan per able-bodied man. Because those over the age of 35 must also bear the same burden, it has caused dissatisfaction among some people.</p>

<p>[Our newspaper Haining News] Xiashi Town in this county is a distribution center for rice in western Zhejiang, and the rice industry has always been the most developed. Recently, due to the lack of sources and the increase in foreign help, and also because of the soaring prices in Shanghai, Hangzhou, and other places, the soaring situation in recent days is rare.

<h3 id="e50">With the National Assembly Concluding Amidst Acclamations, The Constitution is Born, and the Representatives are Much More Relaxed <a href="#e50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>— Our Correspondent Zhang Ming</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 25th] The National Assembly Hall today truly resembled a place celebrating a joyous event. It was both warm and bright, with crowds of people coming and going. Everyone greeted each other with smiles, feeling that they had one less thing on their minds but one more burden on their shoulders. This burden is what every citizen of the Republic of China should bear from today onwards.</p>
<p>Mr. Wu Zhihui, serving as chairman, presented the precious original copy of the Constitution to Chairman Chiang, like Santa Claus bringing the most precious gift.</p>
<p>Mr. Hong Lan's newly trimmed hair and full formal attire made him look like the main character in a household celebrating a happy occasion. His tone was steady and skillful when he read out the document, sounding pleasant to the ear, a world apart from the several fatigue bombardments of the past forty days.</p>
<p>Inside the Assembly Hall, the representatives greeted each other with farewells, discussing nothing more than means of transportation, dates of departure, and numerous farewell banquets. It was indeed a parting for a year, hoping to gather again on this day next year, with endless reluctance. This was a touch of sorrow amidst the joy of the assembly.</p>
<p>Before the meeting, someone was announcing: "All colleagues who participated in the National Conference in the 20th year of the Republic of China and are now participating in the National Assembly, please note that we previously formulated the Provisional Constitution, and today we have completed the Constitution. We hope that after the meeting, colleagues will gather for a commemorative photograph."</p>
<p>Starting today, the draft Constitution of the Republic of China has changed one word, formally becoming a "law." A Constitution bound in brocade and affixed with a red satin strip on the cover, with the words "Constitution of the Republic of China" embossed in gold, in a font three times the size of the late Founding Father's handwriting, is precious and valuable.</p>
<p>The Constitution was only passed at noon today, but it was handed over by the Assembly in the afternoon. It is said that this was achieved single-handedly by Ye Yi, a nameless hero and secretary of the National Assembly. He spent several sleepless nights for this Constitution, and his handwriting has finally become an immortal document in history.</p>
<p>The Constitution was placed on a specially made wooden frame, which was painted with a national flag and inscribed with the words "National Assembly" below. It was placed on the rostrum and surrounded by colorful silk, attracting a constant stream of people who came to admire it, and teams of photographers who came to capture their artistic shots in various styles and angles.</p>
<p>Before the meeting, Mr. Wu Zhihui and the Chairman arrived, with Mr. Wu in front and the Chairman behind. When the meeting adjourned, the Chairman still allowed Mr. Wu to go first, but Mr. Wu repeatedly declined, and as a result, the Chairman stepped out first with a smile.</p>
<p>When Secretary-General Hong and Minister Wu went on stage to hold the handover ceremony, Hong was in front and Wu was behind. When they came down, they deferred to each other, with Wu going first and Hong following behind. These were all meaningful scenes.</p>
<p>When Chairman Chiang delivered his speech, all the representatives maintained a very high level of enthusiasm, and thunderous applause erupted in the hall from time to time. In the end, the sound of "Long live the Republic of China" resounded throughout the hall.</p>
<p>The busiest people in the hall were those signing autographs: journalists, assembly staff, and representatives were all busy asking people to sign their names, especially Mr. Yu Youren, who never stopped writing.</p>
<p>After the National Assembly, the current term is over, and the crown will be taken off and replaced with common clothes.</p>
<p>The photography business outside the entrance of the Assembly Hall was good. Before and after each meeting, groups of people were always taking group photos there. Although it was raining today, they still had no rest. It is said that the Assembly had planned to take a group photo of all the representatives, but the location was difficult to find. In the end, it was decided to be at the Mausoleum, but the weather was uncooperative. It was impossible to take the photo on a rainy day, and most of the representatives will be returning home starting tomorrow, so the photo will probably not be taken.</p>
<p>The last refreshment for the representatives was Mei Lanfang's opera, which was performed at the Lizhi Society tonight and will be performed at the Dahua Theater starting tomorrow. The representatives are in for a treat.</p>

<p>[Our Wuxing Dispatch] This county produces silk, which is famous throughout the country. Since the victory, due to the stimulus of soaring gold prices, the pressure of high-interest loans, the heavy burden of various taxes, and the increase in wages, business has plummeted and the future is precarious. Although the authorities have consulted with the Four Joint Offices to provide silk loans to help them get through the Lunar New Year, the loan terms of the Four Joint Offices are too harsh and are still under negotiation. Other cloth and department stores have suffered heavy losses due to the weak purchasing power of the people and the sluggish market, making it impossible to maintain their operations. More than a dozen stores have closed down one after another within a month. Recently, Tongyu Silk Cloth Store, which has been in business for the longest time and has the largest scope, also suddenly closed down on the 24th of this month and has asked lawyer Jiang Zhongming to announce the liquidation. Keda Cloth Store is also selling off its inventory in preparation for closing down. In the past three days, the prices of essential goods and daily necessities have skyrocketed without end. The price of sesame cakes and fried dough sticks has suddenly doubled, posing a great threat to ordinary people and salaried workers.</p>

<p>[Our Huguan Dispatch] At 4:30 AM on December 24th, a pig boat traveling eastward from Wangting, carrying 49 large pigs, was passing by Gold Rooster 범 at about 4:45 AM when it was suddenly attacked by a bandit boat ambushing there. Six bandits, armed with one pistol, boarded the boat and robbed it. Because there was no cash, they bound all nine people, including boatmen Ji Zian, Ji Rongxiang, Ji Pingshou, Pan Jin'er, and pig merchants surnamed Cao and Ji, as well as passengers traveling to Shanghai, and threw them into the river. Boatman Ji Rongxiang, due to the looseness of the rope, struggled to escape, soaking wet, and ran to the Huguan Town Self-Defense Corps headquarters to report. After receiving the report, the town mayor immediately led 14 members of the Self-Defense Corps to search for the perpetrators at the scene of the incident. After more than four hours, they found nothing except one abandoned bandit boat and one empty boat, which were taken back to the corps headquarters. The details of the incident and the boats have now been submitted to the district branch, and they will continue to apprehend the perpetrators in conjunction with the town police station. The search for the remaining eight drowned victims is also underway.</p>

<p>[United Press Paris, 26th] As France's Minister of Colonial Affairs, Mutai, conducts an on-site investigation in Vietnam, Vietnamese forces have been advancing in a fan shape in the northern Annam and Tonkin provinces, with Viet Minh forces still putting up strong resistance.</p>
<p>[Associated Press Paris, 25th] According to a recent communique issued by the French General Staff in Hanoi, the only place completely controlled by the French forces is the capital of the Viet Minh government. Viet Minh forces are still resisting stubbornly in the surrounding areas. The communique stated: "The pacification war in the city center has already begun."</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse Saigon, 25th] The French military staff has just issued a communique announcing that the French forces have continued to make progress in Vietnam. It stated that the French forces have surrounded the Annamite residential areas of Hanoi and are currently carrying out pacification work. Viet Minh resistance is still very active, but the French forces are constantly advancing towards the cemetery area. Another French team departed from Hanoi and arrived in Bac Ninh this morning and is now continuing to advance towards Phuc Mai. In the Nam Dinh area, Viet Minh forces are still attacking the train station day and night. Among the Viet Minh corpses and several Japanese soldiers' corpses, the Viet Minh losses were heavy, but they are still launching military operations with a very large number of people. The Hai Duong Railway Bridge has been destroyed by Viet Minh forces. A batch of French reinforcements has arrived in Hai Duong from Haiphong. The outskirts of Haiphong are currently being heavily bombarded by Viet Minh mortars. French forces in Lang Son and Da Yen have now made contact, and 3,500 Viet Minh forces attacked Hue on the 19th of this month and were repeatedly defeated by the French forces.</p>
<p>[United Press Paris, 25th] France today launched an effort to strengthen its political and military lines in Vietnam. The first brigade of the French parachute division has departed from North Africa aboard the cruiser "Duguay-Trouin" for Vietnam.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse Saigon, 26th] France's Minister of Overseas Colonies, Mutai, flew here from Calcutta last night. French senior military and political officials in Vietnam welcomed him at the airport. In response to reporters' inquiries, Mutai only said that he was here to conduct on-site inspections and did not want to say more. He added that his stay in Vietnam would be very brief, and he planned to return to France around January 16th. He said that his trip had the full agreement of the National Assembly and that the policy of protecting the French people and friendly allies would not change.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse Saigon, 25th] The arrival of France's Minister of Overseas Colonies, Mutai, has caused a great shock here, similar to the situation when the Minh government fled. Political observers believe that the presence of Minister Mutai and French High Commissioner to Vietnam, d'Argenlieu, in Saigon proves that the French government is willing to reach an agreement with the Viet Minh government.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse Cairo, 25th] General Leclerc, commander of the French Far East Forces, who went to Vietnam for inspection, passed through here last night and left for Calcutta after a brief rest. According to Reuters, Le Gleize received the following instructions before leaving: (1) study the military situation; (2) study the causes of the conflict and ways to restore peace; (3) estimate the total number of reinforcements needed; and (4) report the findings to the Minister of Overseas Colonies, Mutai. The report added that the French authorities plan to transfer another 20,000 troops to reinforce Vietnam, to be transported by the French mail ship "Ile de France" and the former aircraft carrier "Bearn".</p>
<p>[United Press Saigon, 25th] French High Commissioner to Vietnam, d'Argenlieu, gave a broadcast speech to the French residents here today, the content of which roughly stated that France would not agree to the Vietnamese people's demand for complete independence. Independence is nothing but a myth, which is seriously harmful to the interests of both France and Vietnam, but France is willing to fulfill local autonomy agreements. If unconditional and complete independence is granted at the current stage of Vietnamese people's evolution, it would not be a blessing for either side.</p>
<h3 id="e60">Vietnam Designates Neutral Zones to Guarantee the Safety of Overseas Chinese, Negotiations by Our Consul-General Have Failed <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 26th] The situation in Vietnam has rapidly deteriorated in the past week due to the French military actions that triggered the Viet Minh government's resistance. The lives and property of overseas Chinese in Vietnam have been severely damaged. They have submitted requests to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, asking to negotiate with both the French and Vietnamese sides to designate "neutral zones" in cities where overseas Chinese are concentrated, such as Haiphong and Hanoi. It is reported that our diplomatic authorities are considering this proposal.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the negotiations between China and France regarding the implementation of the agreement on the Vietnam issue, which were resumed on the 20th, have stalled again in recent days. This is because the current chaotic situation in Vietnam requires on-site investigations in Vietnam before deciding on a number of issues, such as the designation of the Haiphong free zone, the design of the Yunnan-Vietnam joint transportation plan, and the valuation of compensation for material equipment, all of which cannot be carried out. However, the French delegation still in Beijing and our negotiators all hope that the crux of the issue between France and Vietnam can be resolved quickly, so that the situation in Vietnam can be restored to peace, and that these negotiations can yield results as soon as possible.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse Hanoi, 25th] In the conflicts between French and Vietnamese troops in recent days, only one overseas Chinese has been confirmed dead so far, and the property losses of overseas Chinese are relatively small. However, the lives and property of overseas Chinese in the European quarter have not been damaged. French troops are currently stationed at the boundary between the overseas Chinese area and the Vietnamese area. The Chinese Consul-General in Vietnam entered the area yesterday to contact the Vietnamese and overseas Chinese in order to delineate a neutral zone, but announced this morning that this mission had failed. He will continue his efforts to make this plan a reality. In addition, according to French officials, General Moriere, the commander of the French forces in North Vietnam, has agreed to establish a neutral zone.</p>

<p>[Our Dispatch] London, 26th Broadcast: Four hundred Vietnamese nationals in Bordeaux, France, held a demonstration in support of the Viet Minh government, distributing leaflets calling on French workers to unanimously demand permission for Vietnamese independence. They were dispersed by the police, with no deaths or injuries reported.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse Paris, 26th] Civilians and soldiers of the Republic of Vietnam in France held demonstrations to show their concerns about the Vietnam situation and their emotions ran high. There were demonstrations in Toulon, Bordeaux, Moulins, Massacant, Montluçon, and Lyon, with numbers ranging from 200 to 1,500 people. They shouted slogans such as "French troops no longer stationed in Vietnam," "Respect the Franco-Vietnamese Agreement," and "Long live the Franco-Vietnamese friendship," and demanded an immediate cessation of hostilities within the Republic of Vietnam, otherwise they would carry out a hunger strike.</p>

<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 25th] According to an official gazette announcement: Minister of Overseas Colonies Moutet will be temporarily replaced by Minister of State Laurent during his absence from the country.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, New York, 26th] The "New York Post" recently commented on the establishment of the French Fourth Republic under difficult circumstances, considering it worthy of attention. It elaborated on its reasons as follows: In domestic affairs, the primary concern is the failure to form a government that truly represents all aspects of society, with the Socialist Party forming the cabinet alone. This party holds only one-sixth of the seats in the National Assembly. Secondly, financial difficulties are currently causing France considerable distress. Thirdly, the post-war vitality has not yet fully recovered. In terms of the international situation, France's foreign policy is also wavering between the East and the West. Prolonged government instability cannot alleviate these difficulties. Regarding the Vietnam issue, France, already struggling to cope, is further burdened by engaging in a colonial war. However, considering the deeply rooted humanitarian spirit of the French people, there is still reason for optimism about the future.</p>

However, this news has not yet been confirmed. The French army is conducting strict inspections along the Vietnamese border, making it difficult for the outside world to obtain detailed information about the situation inside. However, it is said that people in Bangkok are generally aware of the German POWs participating in the French army and their desertion.</p>

<p>[United Press, Moscow, 25th] Soviet newspapers today reported that a Soviet whaling fleet, consisting of nine ships and one large supply ship, has set sail from the Soviet Union for Antarctica.</p>
<p>[Kaizo Sha, Tokyo, 26th] According to an announcement today by the Natural Resources Bureau of General MacArthur's Headquarters: the Japanese whaling fleet bound for Antarctica had already begun capturing two giant whales on the 17th, one a blue whale and the other a fin whale, both captured by the Yokosuka fleet. Subsequently, the fleet captured another thirty-one whales in five days. Furthermore, according to a telegram received this morning: the fleet had arrived at the fishing grounds on the 24th. The Nagasaki fleet has also begun fishing, capturing twenty-six whales on the first day. In addition, a British inspection team accompanied the Japanese whaling ship in the Longbow Strait on the 6th of this month to observe.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 25th] A British Foreign Office spokesman stated: There is no basis for the claim in a Washington dispatch that the US State Department has requested the British expedition team stationed in Marguerite Bay, Antarctica, to vacate its occupied base for the use of the expedition led by US Rear Admiral Byrd. The British expedition team in the Falkland Islands resides in self-built houses and has an observatory. Although assistance will be provided to other expeditions if they arrive, the stored food is insufficient for more people.</p>

<p>[United Press, Bali, Denpasar, 25th] Yesterday, the acting Governor-General of East Indonesia, Van Mook, on behalf of Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands, formally declared East Indonesia to be a state within the Indonesian Federation. The state has a population of eight million, including some of the richest coconut and spice producing regions of East Indonesia. The second step in organizing the Indonesian Federation has been completed with the establishment of this state. The third step will be a meeting to be held in Pontianak in January next year to discuss declaring Borneo also as part of the federation. The status of Dutch New Guinea will be decided later. The Republic of Indonesia, East Indonesia, and Borneo will have equal status within the Indonesian Federation. The federation and the Netherlands will both be under the jurisdiction of the Dutch Queen.

<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 25th] Secretary of War Patterson, in a Christmas speech to American wounded veterans, stated that we yearn for peace. Peace is still very far away, but the great powers must agree to discuss disarmament with each other so that the world may have hope for an early conclusion of peace.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 25th] Regarding the implementation of universal military training in the United States, President Truman stated: I intend to remove the word "military" from "universal military training" because the meaning represented by the word military is already contained within what I consider training. The War Department today issued a pamphlet strongly advocating the importance of universal military training, stating that the majority of universal military training will focus on physical development, and will also add subjects related to religious education. Some courses in universal military training already have educational implications, but education is only a byproduct of the training. The purpose of training is definitely not to establish a similar system outside of the existing education system. Universal military training must contribute to national security, otherwise it should not be implemented.</p>

<p>[Agence France-Presse, New Delhi, 26th] It was announced here today that the Asian International Conference is scheduled to open here on March 24th next year and close on April 3rd. Invitations have been sent to 32 countries, but no replies have been received yet, nor has any country indicated its inability to participate. Among non-Asian countries, only Egypt has been invited to participate. The conference will likely be opened by Jawaharlal Nehru, Vice-President of the Indian Provisional Government. Mrs. Naidu, Chairman of the Preparatory Committee, is now arranging everything.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 25th] Regarding the conference of Asian peoples to be held in Delhi, the non-partisan magazine "The Spectator" commented: The recent political maneuvers taken by Jawaharlal Nehru, Vice-President of the Indian Provisional Government, aim to launch his own pan-Asian movement. Nehru's plan is supra-religious and supra-ethnic in nature, aiming to organize a common Asian front to counter the exploitation of Western countries. It differs greatly from Japan's "Greater East Asia" concept. This plan is truly pan-Asian, broad in scope, encompassing everyone from Japanese Shintoists in the east to Lebanese Christians in the west. It holds an optimistic view, believing that all Asian peoples can cooperate hand in hand with love and understanding. Nehru's plan, like the views he holds, is truly great. But whether Nehru believes that a pan-Asian federation can tolerate the existence of Pakistan, and whether Jinnah, the leader of the Muslim League, is willing to see a pan-Asian federation led by Hindus, are all questions. Jinnah believes that as long as Nehru is the head of the Indian government, Islam is in danger, and the Archbishop of Jerusalem deeply agrees.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, New Delhi, 26th] Indian Provisional Government Prime Minister Nehru, Congress President Kripalani, and Party Secretary-General R. M.

<p>[United Press, London, 25th] British Ambassador to Spain Sir Victor Mallet, recalled to his country, arrived here by plane today. The United Nations General Assembly passed a resolution in New York calling on member states to recall their ambassadors to Spain in disapproval of the Franco government. Mallet is the first ambassador to be recalled by the United Nations.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Madrid, 26th] British Ambassador Mallet departed for his country today. Madrid newspapers had published news that made Mallet feel uneasy, accusing the British Embassy here of actively participating in the anti-Franco movement. In fact, while the British Embassy here had contacted people from various factions in Spain while engaging in customary social activities, as far as British reporters know, the anti-Franco elements in Spain were still dissatisfied with the British and American embassies for not daring to actively sympathize with them. The internal relations among the various anti-Franco factions in Spain have not improved over the past year. The declaration issued by Britain, the United States, and France on March 4th, expressing their hope that the Franco government would step down voluntarily and establish a provisional government to hold general elections, further angered the royalist faction among the anti-Franco factions. By July and August, negotiations for unified action among the various anti-Franco factions had almost completely stalled, and the factions still could not reach an agreement on the form of the future government of Spain. In September, the Communist Party abandoned cooperation with the various factions and decided to adopt a decisive republicanism, thus further fragmenting the various anti-Franco factions in Spain.</p>
<h3 id="e76">A Major Post-War Issue: The Repatriation of Japanese Troops and Civilians <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>The three million people in the China mainland area have already been repatriated. In addition, there are one million people who were originally in the Northeast region. Due to the complexity of the political situation, the fate of these Japanese people is still uncertain.</p>
<p>Repatriating millions of Japanese prisoners of war and civilians from China back to Japan is indeed a vast and difficult task, but with the cooperation of the United States and China, it can generally be said to have been "successfully completed."</p>
<p>On the day the Japanese Emperor announced the unconditional surrender rescript, the day the Japanese army laid down its weapons, which was also the day the World War and the Sino-Japanese War officially ended, there were four million Japanese troops and civilians in China. However, after a year of efforts, three million of them have returned to their homeland. The remaining one million were originally in Manchuria (the Nine Northeastern Provinces). Due to the profound and unpredictable Soviet policies, the repatriation of these one million people has not been resolved for the time being, and the United States also feels helpless.</p>
<p>Loneze, a special correspondent for "World Report Weekly," recently sent a report from Shanghai, explaining the inside story of the repatriation of Japanese troops and civilians very clearly. Now, the main points are translated below.</p>
<p>The work of repatriating Japanese troops and civilians began in December last year with the cooperation of the United States and China. The method was to systematically disarm them first, and gradually concentrate them together. However, China is vast and the distribution of Japanese troops and civilians is extremely wide, so it had to be carried out in different areas. At that time, it was decided to first handle the South China, Taiwan, and Vietnam areas, and a total of more than 600,000 Japanese were repatriated in more than three months. The next area was Central China, where a total of more than 800,000 Japanese were repatriated. The last area was North China, where a total of about 554,000 Japanese were repatriated, which was recently completed.</p>
<p>During the repatriation process, a noteworthy conclusion was reached regarding the extent to which Japanese civilians had penetrated into China: the ratio of Japanese troops to Japanese civilians was three to two. In other words, for every three Japanese soldiers repatriated, two civilians were repatriated. The progress of the repatriation of Japanese soldiers had a dual impact on Japan itself: on the one hand, there was a general feeling of comfort, feeling that the nationals scattered in various places had finally returned; on the other hand, it aroused various economic anxieties.</p>
<p>On the bright side, many families were able to reunite, the surplus labor could be applied to production work, and the government was not at a loss when drafting the revival plan. This point greatly enhanced the prestige of the United States, because unlike the Soviet Union, the United States was able to abide by the responsibilities stipulated in the Potsdam Declaration.</p>
<p>But on the bad side, the costs of repatriating Japanese troops and civilians had to be borne mostly by the Japanese government, and this expense was quite large. At the same time, it was really a tricky matter to accommodate so many returning troops and civilians in Japan's shattered post-war economic structure. What's more, the food and housing problems became even more serious. But no matter how bad the bad side was, the Japanese still felt that the rapid progress of the repatriation work was worthwhile. Therefore, no matter how huge the expenditure, they still hoped to send the one million Japanese troops and civilians in Manchuria back to their country as soon as possible. But this matter is more complicated because the Soviet Union is involved.</p>
<p>The rapid repatriation of Japanese troops and civilians from the US-controlled area made the Japanese feel dissatisfied with the Soviet measures. This can be seen from the recent demonstration held by the Japanese in front of the Soviet Embassy in Tokyo, demanding the acceleration of the repatriation work. The Soviet Union has always paid great attention to Japan, and has greatly promoted the glory of communism and the Soviet Union's concern for the Japanese people. However, the twists and turns in the repatriation work have obviously been a major blow to the work of the Japanese Communist Party and the Soviet delegation.</p>
<p>After many compromises, the Soviet Union finally decided to repatriate 10,000 to 15,000 Japanese from a port in eastern Siberia every month (recent reports said that MacArthur and the Soviet authorities had established an agreement to repatriate 50,000 people per month - translator), but the Japanese still cannot feel very satisfied, because when the United States repatriated Japanese from mainland China, the peak of the work reached 12,000 people repatriated per day.</p>
<p>Another thing that made the Japanese dissatisfied was that the Soviet Union was prepared to send Japanese civilians first, and delay the repatriation of Japanese prisoners of war as much as possible. According to estimates from all parties, there are at least 800,000 Japanese troops in Soviet hands. The United States believes that 700,000 of them have been transported from Manchuria to Siberia, working in labor camps. The Japanese believe that this violates the Potsdam Declaration. At the same time, according to the current method, it will take at least several years to repatriate one million people.</p>
<p>How things will develop in the future is of course not something anyone can predict, because the situation can change at any time. But one thing is very worthy of attention, that is, the repatriation of Japanese troops and civilians from the China mainland area has been completed. The war that Tokyo has always called the "Sino-Japanese Incident" has formally and officially ended after a long nine years. (Translated by Ya Nong from "World Report Weekly")</p>

<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 25th] King George VI of England spent the Christmas holiday today with the royal family at Sandringham House, sharing a Christmas dinner, with turkey and plum pudding as the main dishes. After the meal, the King stepped into the study and broadcast the Christmas message to the people of the country in front of the golden microphone. Queen Mother Mary, Queen Elizabeth, and the princesses were all present to listen. The King encouraged the whole country with the word "courage." His words included: On this Christmas day, I and the Queen are reunited with the royal family in the palace to spend the holiday, and we are all mindful of the British Empire as a large family spanning the globe. The war has left the world full of wounds, with rubble everywhere. Politicians bear the heavy responsibility of stabilizing the world, and it has been no easy task to work tirelessly for a year. Only with continued patience and goodwill can the world return to normal. When Britain encountered bombing, we showed our spirit, and in the future we will still be able to re-demonstrate the same spirit with patience and discipline. We are celebrating Christmas today as free people in a peaceful environment. People may still feel a lack of essential supplies in their daily lives, but we should not worry too much about the current difficulties, we should think of the great future. Mobilize the spirit of Christ to remedy our daily lives and to relieve the suffering people everywhere.</p>
<p>[United Press, London, 25th] The Archbishop of Canterbury issued a Christmas message today, urging people to increase their faith. He said that the situation is difficult, and the moral and material conditions in various parts of the world are dangerous, pressing on the spirit of everyone and everyone, how can we still talk about increasing faith at this time? But Christmas tells us how to obtain peace and joy, and humans cannot create peace and joy on their own. Christ came to give peace and joy, and mankind must humbly accept it.</p>

<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 25th] The head of the mobile reconnaissance unit in Nice, Valley Danri, arrested a serpent beauty yesterday, suspected of killing more than twenty people. The arrested person is Madame Tang Doulan, also known as the Baroness, and some even respect her as the Marchioness. Most of her fifty years have been spent in the Middle East, especially in Syria and Lebanon. In 1936, her husband, Baron Bell, was assassinated in a hotel in the Syrian desert, suffering nineteen knife wounds. The hotel was established by the Baron. Madame Tang sought revenge for her husband, resulting in the arrest of two suspects. However, two French military officers publicly suspected that the murderer was Madame Tang herself. Shortly afterward, the two officers went out and were nearly run over by Madame Tang's car. The two men sued the police, but to no avail. Later, Tang Doulan remarried a Muslim and lived in the home of a relative of an Arab king, virtually under house arrest. In 1939, she sneaked into Mecca, the holy city of Islam, to sell a large quantity of jewelry and diamonds of unknown origin. She had previously seduced an official of an embassy, ​​so she was able to leave the country smoothly. After arriving in Mecca, she also attempted to kill an Arab chieftain. The King was furious and sentenced her to death, but she was resourceful and escaped to North Africa. During World War II, she was even regarded as a political prisoner and received protection. In August of this year, Tang Doulan and her son (a reporter for a newspaper in Nice) came to Nice and began to enjoy themselves. Until recently, the mother and son were arrested for trafficking in gold, but her son was soon released. Detective Chief Valley Danri had been following her throughout Syria, Lebanon, and North Africa. According to him, "She is a most dangerous woman. She knows how to use poison or a dagger." It is said that fifteen to twenty men have died at her hands, but the police department is keeping the entire case secret, and details will probably be released after the suspect is brought to Paris.</p>

<p>The fuselage and nose of Central Air Transport Corporation's Flight 48, which crashed in the rice fields of Zhangjiazhai, Zhang Huabang, Jiangwan, have been completely split and burned, with only the tail remaining. When the reporter went to inspect the scene yesterday afternoon along a muddy path, thick smoke was still coming out of the remaining parts of the tail. In the rice field, there was a liver and lungs that had turned purple-red, and a severed woman's foot. Two people in military uniforms and a village child were groping in the water. One of them claimed to have found a gold ring, and the village child picked up several thousand-yuan and five-hundred-yuan bills, squatting in the pond to wash off the mud.</p>
<p>The plane took off from Chongqing at 8 a.m. yesterday morning and arrived in the Shanghai area at 5:30 p.m. Due to the dense fog, Longhua Airport did not have blind landing equipment, so it turned to Jiangwan. According to Central Air Transport Corporation, the plane made contact with the ground at the time, but due to the heavy fog and poor visibility, it overran the runway during landing and crashed into the rice fields, catching fire and burning.</p>

<p>Two houses in Zhangjiazhai were destroyed, and the roof beams were knocked away several feet away. Although the two houses had been built for several years, the nearby villagers still called them "new houses." The owner of the house, Zhang Guoye, works at the telegraph office and is currently in Nanjing. His wife, Zhang Qunxian, died on the spot. The villagers also called Zhang Qunxian "the new bride," although she had already given birth to three children. Zhang Yuezhi, 11, and Zhang Xinzhi, 9, were seriously injured and have been sent to the hospital. Zhang Lindi, 8, was fortunately only slightly scratched. Zhang Guoye's old mother, Zhang Lu, was also seriously injured and has been sent to the hospital.</p>
<p>Fortunately, a nearby tiled house adjacent to the destroyed houses was not affected. According to the people in the house, at around 6 o'clock the night before, they were having dinner when they heard two cracking sounds, followed by a loud boom, a flash of light, like a bomb had landed. The foundation of the house also shook. The plane crashed and caught fire. They tried their best to put out the fire, but because the gasoline was burning fiercely, they could only remove the straw next to the door and pour the feces from the manure tank. At the same time, the American soldiers stationed at Jiangwan Airport also rushed to the rescue, and the fire was prevented from spreading, but the embers did not stop until dawn.</p>
<p>All eleven passengers, pilots, and radio operators on the plane were killed.</p>
<p>Regarding the aftermath of the Central Air Transport Corporation Flight 48 accident, Wu Lieqi, secretary of the Flight Crew, led a team of senior officials from the Field Operations Section, General Affairs Section, and Vehicle Dispatch Section to the accident site at 8 a.m. yesterday to transport the bodies of the victims to the China Funeral Parlor to perform injections and cleaning. Soon after, China National Aviation Corporation also sent the victims of the company's accident to the China Funeral Parlor. Because there were many bodies to be prepared, Central Air Transport Corporation was afraid that the funeral parlor would be too busy to cope with it, so they specially moved the bodies to the Central Funeral Parlor on Gordon Road, Mabai Road, after 7 p.m. The coffin will be sealed today. It is said that most of the victims have been identified by their families.</p>

<p>China National Aviation Corporation Flight 115 from Chongqing to Shanghai crashed in a pond to the right of the Heta Temple (River Pagoda Temple) in Qian San Road (from Qianliang Temple to Sanlintang) near the No. 3 bridge on the Shanghai-Minhang Highway. The reporter drove to the area in the wind and rain yesterday morning for an inspection. After traveling south for several kilometers past the Shanghai Provincial High School, there was a road that only allowed a Jeep to pass, leading to the Heta Temple. The temple is near the Huangpu River, about four li (Chinese mile) away from the highway. From the car, one could see the silver-white wreckage of Flight 115. Upon arriving at the temple, the first thing that caught the eye was a heartbreaking sight: twenty-nine bodies of male and female passengers, large and small, were lined up by the small stream in front of the temple. The clothes on the bodies were still intact, but after being exposed to the wind and rain all night, the bodies were icy and hard. The elbows of five of the bodies were bent upwards towards the sky, like a statue. One corpse had a broken skull with brain matter flowing out, another had a foot severed, and several had blood stains on their faces, but most did not have obvious injuries. According to nearby villagers, all the bodies were fished out of the small pond next to the Heta Temple, so some of the deceased must have jumped out of the cabin and drowned in the pond as the plane was about to crash. It is also said that three people were still breathing when they were rescued last night, but because it was midnight and transportation was inconvenient, there was no way to rescue them, so they soon died.</p>

<p>Flight 115 was destroyed in the small pond surrounding the Heta Temple. The nose of the plane was cut off, the right wing was broken, and the tail was split, but the fuselage was still intact. Its landing state was completely like a normal stop. The western half of the Heta Temple was destroyed, with rubble everywhere. A clay sculpture of a "bailiff" in the temple had fallen to the ground, but the temple god in the main hall was still sitting upright unscathed. The open space behind the temple faced the wreckage of the plane. Fragments of documents and papers were scattered all over the ground. Business cards and blank checks were found at the cut-off point of the plane's nose. The reporter also picked up a "love letter" stained with mud, dated the 23rd of this month, which was probably written by a female passenger on the plane but not sent. It read, "My dear [omitted], the departure date cannot be decided, it's really frustrating... Your [omitted]." It was heartbreaking to read. Broken clothes were still hanging on the branches of trees in the open space. The remaining suitcases and other items on the plane were being cleaned up and piled up on the lawn in front of the temple by China National Aviation Corporation personnel.</p>

<h3 id="e90">Loud Noise, Sky-High Flames: Elementary School Principal Escapes Death <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>Although the Heta Temple was severely damaged, fortunately there were no casualties. However, Sun Jianjin, the principal of the private Huadong Elementary School in the village, escaped death. Principal Sun stayed in the western part of the main hall of the temple every night. At around 8 o'clock the night before, he was sound asleep when he suddenly heard a loud noise and woke up from his dream. The bed curtain had fallen down, and he felt a heavy object pressing on his feet. In a hurry, he poked his head out and saw flames reaching the sky. At the time, he never thought that it was a plane crash, but thought that it was a fire caused by lightning, so he hurriedly got out of bed, put on his clothes, and ran out. At this time, he was flustered and confused, and the east hall had been destroyed, so he could not identify the direction. Later, he calmed down a little and went around the bamboo garden behind the temple to the neighboring houses, where he joined the villagers in sounding gongs to call for help. Principal Sun smiled when he talked to the reporter about the situation at the time, and said, "Fortunately, I always sleep with my head facing east and my feet facing west, otherwise my head would have been crushed, and I would have died."</p>

<p>When the reporters and others were inspecting the surrounding area, two family members of the victims (male) came to identify the bodies. Obviously, the relatives they were looking for were among the corpses, so their eyes were filled with tears. The county government had also sent people to deal with the situation at this time, but the bodies had not been moved by the time the reporter left (2 p.m.). At this time, two official cars were parked by the road. A woman in one of the cars looked around with teary eyes and opened the car door to ask in the rain when she saw the reporters. She claimed to be the wife of Le Zuolin, the general manager of Qinghua Pigment Company. Her husband had called and said that he was taking China National Aviation Corporation Flight 115 to Shanghai. This morning, after learning about the plane crash, she had inquired at various hospitals but had not found him. She feared that he had died. She was sobbing as she spoke.</p>
<p>In addition, the China National Aviation Corporation personnel who were taking care of the scene yesterday prohibited reporters from taking photos of the corpses. A foreign employee even held an iron bar and tried to rush towards a newspaper photographer, which caused public outrage and almost led to an incident.</p>
<h3 id="e92">Fifteen People Under Treatment at Zhongshan Hospital, Yu Peng Has Died, Zhang Chunhua and Xue Jinfan Are the Least Injured <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>[Our Reporter] At 3:30 p.m. yesterday, Dr. C.F. Hoey, the medical director of China National Aviation Corporation, went to Zhongshan Hospital to visit the injured passengers who were rescued from the company's two ill-fated planes. China National Aviation Corporation sent three batches of injured people to the hospital from the night before the accident until yesterday morning, a total of fifteen people. The first batch of seven people: Yu Peng (seriously injured), Zhao Jixing (male), kidney rupture, bleeding in urine, skull fracture, in a coma. Liu Tengxiang (male), concussion, Chen Ar-er (male), right leg broken, Zhang Qiyun (female), injured head and left leg, Min Wanzhen (female), injured head and knees, unnamed (female), has been in a coma since being sent to the hospital. The second batch of four people: Zhang Chunhua (male), left foot tibia and fibula broken, Wu Rongbing (male), left ulna broken, Xue Jinfan (male), injured arm, relatively slightly injured, Preus (male, the captain of Flight 115), seriously injured head and face, in a coma. There were also two unnamed children, one of whom died at 6:50 p.m. yesterday, less than one year old. The other had both legs broken, about one year old. The third batch of two people: Wang Xiaode (male, the radio operator of Flight 115), knee joint dislocation, femur, tibia, and fibula broken in four places, brain laceration, very serious condition, Xu Weilong (male), injured head and face.</p>
<p>Among the aforementioned fifteen injured people, Yu Peng died yesterday morning. The unnamed female and Wang Xiaode also became terminally ill by last night due to their serious injuries. The rest are doing well. Among them, Zhang Chunhua and Xue Jinfan, passengers on Flight 115, were the least injured. They were even allowed by the doctor to have a brief conversation with the reporter.</p>
<p>Zhang Chunhua is a Pingju (Peking Opera) actor who plays the role of a martial clown. Only his right ear and left heel were slightly injured. He is currently staying in a second-class ward on the second floor. A female friend surnamed Zhou was comforting him. Zhang performed with Li Shaochun at the Hankou Grand Theater until the 16th. He could have returned to Shanghai with Li at the same time, but the stage had not been able to pay Zhang's remuneration on time, so he was delayed until the 25th to start. He originally planned to rest for a while after arriving in Shanghai and then immediately go to Tianjin to perform, but he happened to encounter the accident.</p>
<p>According to Zhang, the plane arrived over Shanghai at around 7 o'clock, and he was asleep. When he was awakened by the extreme impact, the plane had already crashed. Zhang woke up from the coma and did not know that he had been injured. When he tried to stand up, he realized that his left leg was broken. He rolled around the plane until someone came to rescue him after midnight.</p>
<p>Xue Jinfan is a department store merchant who came to Shanghai from Chongqing to purchase goods. There were six partners traveling with him, but only Xue survived. Xue was sitting in the middle seat of the plane. He only knew that the plane could not land, but he did not expect anything else. When the plane suddenly crashed, he became unconscious. When he woke up, he saw that he had been thrown out of the plane and was lying on the river beach. There was a woman next to him. Xue himself had the ability to help others and tried to help her, but he knew that she was a corpse. At this time, he suddenly realized that he himself had been injured and fell to the ground due to exhaustion. After being rescued to the hospital, his condition has been very good, and relatives and friends have visited him several times.</p>
<p>The condition of Preus, the American pilot of Flight 115, is quite serious. When Dr. Hoey of China National Aviation Corporation went into the room to visit him, he was still unable to speak. His head, cheeks, and other parts were bandaged with gauze and silk ribbons. His left leg was broken. Dr. Hoey instructed the doctors in the hospital to move Preus to the best ward, hire a special nurse, and continuously transfuse blood when necessary, and use X-rays to examine his chest and abdomen for injuries. He also said that there was no problem with medical expenses, and everything would be paid by China National Aviation Corporation. If Preus can be rescued, he will probably be the only pilot saved from the three ill-fated planes.</p>

<h3 id="e93">China National Aviation Corporation Announces Cause of Accident: Attempted Blind Landing Resulted in Tragic Crash; Total of Sixty Passengers on Both Planes <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>China National Aviation Corporation issued the following public announcement yesterday regarding the cause of the recent accident:</p>
<p>The loss of two passenger planes flying from Chongqing to Shanghai on the evening before last (December 25th) by China National Aviation Corporation is deeply regrettable. Aircraft No. 140, a C-47 model, piloted by J.M. Greenwood, co-piloted by Liu Linsen, and with radio operator Jin Keng accompanying, took off from Chongqing's Shanba Airport at 10:15 a.m., with planned stops in Wuchang and Nanjing. Aircraft No. 115, a C-46 model, piloted by R.B. Preus, co-piloted by Tan Xingzheng, and with radio operator Wang Xiaode accompanying, took off from Chongqing's Baishi Airport at 10:30 a.m., with a planned stop in Wuchang, and then flying directly to Shanghai. Both planes left Wuchang in succession, fifteen minutes apart. At that time,</p>
<p>the weather in both Nanjing and Shanghai was still suitable for landing. However, as they approached Nanjing, the weather in both Nanjing and Shanghai suddenly changed drastically. Because Wuchang Airport lacked night-flying equipment, it was impossible to return. Both Nanjing and Shanghai airports had night-flying equipment for nighttime landings, especially Jiangwan Airport, which had more comprehensive blind landing and night-flying equipment. Aircraft No. 140, which was originally scheduled to stop in Nanjing, attempted to land in Nanjing, but due to the weather, the airport was completely invisible. The pilot then continued to fly to Shanghai. Aircraft No. 115 arrived in Shanghai airspace at 5:30 p.m., and Aircraft No. 140 arrived an hour later. At that time, the weather in Shanghai was the same as in Nanjing.</p>
<p>Aircraft No. 140 first attempted to land at Jiangwan Airport using blind landing equipment. The pilot circled above the airport for over an hour and, after several attempts, found that the radio equipment on the plane was partially malfunctioning, making it impossible to use the blind landing system. Although they could communicate with the control tower, the power was too weak to establish contact with the blind landing equipment. After another hour of attempts, they were certain that landing at Jiangwan was impossible, leaving no other option than to fly to Longhua. However, when attempting to land at Longhua Airport, the visibility was still zero. After several attempts, they finally notified the control tower that the plane was out of fuel and had to make a forced landing. While attempting to correct the landing direction, the plane crashed at the southwestern end of the airport at 7:55 p.m. As for aircraft No.</p>
<p>115, after circling over Jiangwan, they were able to contact the blind landing equipment, but the connection was sometimes unclear. Under these circumstances, a safe landing was unlikely. Therefore, at around 9:00 p.m., they flew from Jiangwan to Longhua Airport. At this time, the weather had changed slightly, and visibility gradually improved. After repeated attempts to land, their last attempt was almost successful. They only needed to make one more circle to change direction when, unexpectedly, the plane crashed one mile southwest of the airport, at the Huangjiadu River Temple Pagoda. The cause of the crash is still unclear. Aircraft No. 115 circled over Jiangwan for three hours and thirty minutes. For the first two hours, Aircraft No. 140 and another China National Aviation Corporation plane were also in the air.</p>
<p>Aircraft No. 147</p>
<p>In addition, two other aircraft, China National Aviation Corporation's Aircraft No. 147, landed safely at Jiangwan Airport at 7:40 p.m. When Aircraft No. 140 was attempting to land at Longhua, executives and aviation personnel from China National Aviation Corporation were waiting at the airport. The airport's fire brigade, ambulances, and medical personnel were also summoned. The municipal police department was notified, and police and firefighters were dispatched to the scene in case of emergency, so that timely rescue could be provided when the accident occurred. As for Aircraft No. 115, news of the accident was received about an hour after contact was lost. At that time, the U.S. military and U.S. Navy assisted in the search, and the water police and U.S. Navy dispatched multiple boats.</p>
<p>Reconnaissance along the River</p>
<p>Aircraft No. 140 carried 27 passengers and 3 crew members. Aircraft No. 115 carried 33 passengers and 3 crew members. The injured have all been sent to hospitals. Unfortunately, the number of fatalities is quite high. The names of the passengers and other detailed information will be disclosed after further investigation.</p>

<p>In the International Funeral Home, the deceased lie quietly, many of their bodies covered in flowers. In the China Funeral Home, the situation is different. The bodies are piled together, blood, mud, and rain staining their clothes beyond recognition. The grieving families sometimes can only identify their relatives by a single high-heeled shoe! The cries are earth-shattering, a tragic sight to behold.</p>
<p>Xia Changjun, a victim from the Central Aircraft, was a grain specialist from Shao County. He and his wife, Xia Wu Shuzhen, died together. Xia Changjun's death was particularly gruesome, with one leg severed. Yang Xizhi, the former special commissioner of grain administration, personally identified the body yesterday. Relatives of Mrs. Xia fainted from grief upon seeing her remains! The Xia couple had only married in May of this year. Unexpectedly, they became a tragic pair in less than a year! Liu Linsen, the co-pilot of the Central Aircraft, also perished in the accident. He had only been engaged for two months. Yesterday, Liu's fiancée went to identify his body, a scene of utter desolation!</p>
<p>Zhao, a representative of the National Assembly from Liaoning Province in Shenyang, and his mother, Zhao Wang Yuxian, along with his son, Zhao Jixing, were flying from Chongqing to Nanjing to visit the representative. Due to the weather, they changed their flight to Shanghai, but unexpectedly met with this disaster, mother and son dying together. Zhao's second son, Zhongxing, has arrived at the International Funeral Home to identify the bodies and arrange the funeral. He has also urgently telegraphed Representative Zhao in Nanjing to come to Shanghai.</p>
<p>At the International Funeral Home, someone recognized a deceased person as their relative, Zhang Qiyun. However, Zhang Qiyun was resting peacefully in bed number 30 in room number six of Zhongshan Hospital. She could still speak and said that she was indeed Zhang Qiyun. It was later discovered that it was a misunderstanding.</p>
<p>The U.S. military police (MP) were driving a jeep rapidly through the wind and rain to take the injured to the hospital the night before. Unfortunately, the vehicle was going too fast and struck a pedestrian, Li Chen, injuring her head. As a result, she was sent to Zhongshan Hospital along with the accident victims.</p>
<p>At Zhongshan Hospital, two plane tickets were found next to the body of a victim. One ticket was in the name of Yu Peng, and the other was in the name of Zhang Zhenjiang, making it impossible to determine the victim's name.</p>
<p>Next to the wreckage of China National Aviation's Aircraft No. 115, rescuers picked up a little boy wearing a calico jacket. Thank goodness, he was not injured at all! When reporters arrived at Zhongshan Hospital, he had already been safely taken to the hospital and was asleep. He said his name was Wang Didi and that he was four years old. Who his parents are and where he came from are currently unknown. On Christmas Eve, he may have been a beloved and happy little angel—but now, he has become an orphan adrift in the world!</p>

<p>China National Aviation Corporation's Chongqing-Shanghai flight No. 140 crashed near the main runway of Longhua Airport. The wreckage was cleared by the company using a crane yesterday morning. The Red Cross ambulance No. 6, which was inadvertently overturned near the runway while transporting the injured and dead in the dark the night before, has also been towed away. Scattered aircraft parts, as well as piles of tattered clothes, shoes, and socks, can still be seen on the lawn where the plane crashed, with bloodstains blurring the scene. Some passengers on the plane were carrying Sichuan Guangju oranges, which now shared the same tragic fate as their owners, with orange peels scattered everywhere, yet to be cleaned up.</p>
<p>On the night of the accident, the plane soared over the city for two or three hours. Finally, running out of fuel, the nose of the plane plunged straight to the ground, hitting the wing of another plane parked there upon impact, before flipping over several times and being destroyed.</p>
<p>While the two planes were circling in the city's airspace, Wu Shi, the head of the company's aviation division, McDonnell, the chief pilot, Gao Dajing, the head of the business division, Wu Zhihong, the director of the Shanghai ticket office, as well as American director Shedivy and several senior pilots, were all waiting at the airport. Chief Pilot McDonnell personally directed operations from the control tower. Shen Desie, the general manager of the company, Mr. Lano of Pan American Airlines, and Dr. Salade also arrived successively to supervise the rescue efforts until dawn the next day.</p>

<p>[Report from this newspaper] At 8:30 last night, a transport truck fully loaded with goods was speeding west on Weidemer Road in Jiangwan, in front of Fudan University, when it was spotted by a patrol team from the Xinshijie Police Station. The police immediately ordered the truck to stop for inspection. Unexpectedly, someone in uniform suddenly fired two shots at the police officers and continued to accelerate westward. The police officers returned fire with twelve shots, but were unable to intercept the truck. Afterwards, the police officers telegraphed the police station and learned that the truck belonged to the Gongda Motor Transport Company. Xiao Jun, a member of the second unit of the police station, along with plainclothes police officers Liu Renqian, Lu Wenxuan, and Shi Chenghou, went to the Gongda Motor Transport Company to investigate. They learned that the truck had indeed left the company at 5:55 p.m. on a trip to Jiangwan. They waited until 9:30 p.m. when the truck returned to the company, and the police officers detained the driver, Wang Zhengming, for questioning. According to Wang, shortly after leaving the transport company, five people in uniform boarded the truck and ordered him to drive straight to the vicinity of Jiangwan Airport, where they loaded twenty boxes of white paint and seven pieces of steel plate weighing five hundred pounds each. They then ordered him to drive back to Shanghai. When they reached the front of No. 19 Qufu Road, near Tiantong Road, they were seen by police officers who attempted to stop them. At that time, the two military officers sitting next to him, one of them took out a gun and forced him to continue driving. The other person fired a gun outside the vehicle. Later, the truck stopped in front of No. 19 Qufu Road, where there were already more than twenty people waiting. They unloaded all the goods from the truck and then allowed him to return. Based on this testimony, the police station immediately went to No. 19 Qufu Road. However, the criminals had already fled after hearing the news. The police only found all the stolen goods inside the building and arrested the wife of the store owner, Zhou Genbao, and brought her back to the police station. The investigation is still underway.</p>

<p>President of the Executive Yuan, Song Ziwen, went to the Bank of China Building at around 9:00 a.m. yesterday to handle official business. At around 10:00 a.m., Mayor Wu Guozhen and leading figures from the Sixth District Machinery Cotton Textile Industry Association, including Wang Qiyu, Rong Hongyuan, Guo Dihuo, and Tang Xinghai, paid a joint visit. Song met with them, and the discussion lasted an hour. The content focused on decisions regarding suppressing yarn and cloth price hikes and increasing production. The principles can be divided into: (1) Ceasing the distribution of reprocessed cotton yarn and transferring the existing quantity to the Textile Management Committee for use in suppressing market prices at any time. (2) Private factories request foreign exchange to import raw cotton. After the finished products are manufactured, half of them should be allocated to the Management Committee for sale to the market, to suppress market price hikes, and a portion of them should be exported to earn foreign exchange. A draft plan will be prepared by the Textile Management Committee, reviewed by a small group, and then submitted to the general meeting for approval, to be implemented on a trial basis starting in January of next year. (3) It is hoped that private factories will do their best to promote the sale of domestic cotton to save foreign exchange. Subsequently, Lin Fengbao of the Central Bank also reported to Song on the fact that the Central Bank of Japan's sale of gold had been effective, reporting on the details. At 12:00, Song also met with financial figures Zhao Dihua, Xu Weiming, Hu Huichun, etc., to discuss matters. At that time, Song also invited Xu Weiming to lunch. He then returned to his office at around 2:00 p.m. After 4:00 p.m., Song summoned Shu Yunzhang of the Textile Construction Company and Yang Xiren of the Textile Management Committee. At around 6:00 p.m., he also met with Xu Jizhuang, the director of the Postal Savings and Remittances Bureau, to discuss matters.</p>

<p>[Report from this newspaper] Mayor Wu, accompanied by Director of Civil Affairs Zhang Xiaosong and Chen Baotai, a member of the municipal party headquarters, took the municipal ferry across the river at Dongjiadu Pier at 2:00 p.m. yesterday, despite the rain, and traveled in three special vehicles to inspect the Yangsi District in Pudong. Accompanied by the district chief, Zhu Youguo, he visited Yangsi Middle School. Students were in class at the time. He then went to inspect the district's health sub-office, where the director, Tang Shenqi, reported on its work. The office was established three months ago and has achieved excellent results, but the start-up funds have not yet been received. The current equipment and furniture have been donated by local gentry Chen Tianxi. Mayor Wu also went to the Yangjing District, where he was accompanied by the district chief, Zhang Ruoxu, to inspect the shanty towns along Dongchang Road. The Mayor personally entered the dark shanty houses, inquiring about the lives of the village women and checking household registrations, which were accurate.</p>
<p>Although it was drizzling yesterday and the roads were muddy, the Mayor was detailed in his inquiries and investigated the household registrations in great detail. The local gentry, Chen Zixin, also provided tea and refreshments.</p>
<p>According to Qi Peiran, the head of the Yangsi District Branch in Pudong, the district has 102 administrative police officers and a security police squadron, so there is absolutely no worry about local security. The Mayor was very satisfied with the district's household registration work, and returned to the municipal government at around 5:00 p.m.</p>

<p>[Report from this newspaper] The Finance Committee of the Municipal Council held its sixth meeting at the Hongqiao Club yesterday afternoon, continuing to discuss tax issues, with Hu Wenyuan, deputy director of the Finance Bureau, attending to provide explanations. The items discussed at the meeting included: (1) Regarding the Finance Bureau's "Implementation Measures for Collecting In-Kind Converted into National Currency for Farmland Tax in Fiscal Year 35" and "Provisional Measures for Temporary Clearance of Grain Registration When Collecting Farmland Tax," the council members Lu Shidao and Wang Weiyin were appointed to review them, and their review opinions were submitted to the municipal government for reference. Deputy Director Hu explained that the farmland grain registration in the city has always been controlled by clerks (commonly known as "land skin ghosts"). Currently, the bureau has dispatched personnel to clear them up according to the above measures. Since implementation, the results have been excellent, and there have been no cases of harassment. Collection can begin as early as February next spring.</p>
<p>(2) Citizens, the Chamber of Commerce, and candidate council members in the city have all proposed to the Municipal Council that the Finance Bureau's calculation of property tax and municipal construction tax for the autumn season in the city is not based on the rental value calculated by the former Public Concession in 1926, and requested that it be corrected. The committee decided to send this opinion to the municipal government for review. Deputy Director Hu also explained that the Slaughter Tax Law, the Banquet and Entertainment Tax Law, and the Property Tax Regulations have all been revised by the National Government and differ greatly from the current system. Based on the city's collection experience, the Finance Bureau feels that there are some aspects that are not entirely suitable for local conditions and has telegraphed the central government to request further revisions. It is also prepared to submit this to the second general meeting of the Municipal Council for study. If collection is implemented according to the new tax law, it is estimated that the city's tax revenue will decrease by 3 billion yuan per month. Furthermore, according to an order from the Executive Yuan, local governments can levy three types of special taxes, but they must be approved by the representative body. The municipal construction damage and hotel tax for fiscal year 36 are still planned to be included in the budget, based on this order.</p>
<p>(3) The committee decided to request financial relief for the city's ballroom industry association, which urgently requested exemption from the ballroom beverage tax, and the instruments and stationery industry association, which requested exemption from business tax.</p>
<p>(4) The committee also approved a telegram from the Qingdao Municipal Council, unanimously advocating that all land business tax revenue be allocated to the local government. It also proposed that the central government continue to allocate the three types of property rental income tax, property sales income tax, and stamp tax, and increase the allocation ratio to 50% of net income. It was resolved to recommend that the second general meeting discuss and decide on this.</p>

<p>Increase Allocations to Retailers</p>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Reliable sources say that the relevant authorities are actively improving the supply of coal for winter use in the city. The Fuel Management Committee has purchased over 10,000 tons of coal in Vietnam and has dispatched three special ships to transport it to Shanghai immediately. Although the conflict between France and Vietnam is intensifying, transport is expected to be unaffected due to prior arrangements. As for the distribution of coal briquettes, the authorities are paying close attention to cracking down on the black market. The amount of coal briquettes sold at the factory gate will be restricted as much as possible, and the maximum allocation will be given to retailers, who will then distribute the briquettes by district with detailed records available for inspection. In this way, the black market can be prevented from emerging. Furthermore, the Social Affairs Bureau will convene a coal price review meeting today to discuss the profit margins of retailers and technical improvements in district distribution.</p>

<p>[Report from this newspaper] The Shanghai Port Affairs Committee's Anti-Smuggling and Security Team discovered that relief supplies and general cargo had been stolen from the American ship "Staghound," which was moored at the Kaiyan Wharf in Riyu Harbor, on the 22nd of this month. The unloading workers on the ship colluded with Gong Shanqi, the "captain" of the No. 787 barge of the General Storage and Transportation Bureau, to steal cargo and hide it on the barge. The stolen goods that were seized included two large bundles of fine wool navy serge, two woolen blankets, and two pounds of wool yarn, secretly packed in flour sacks, estimated to be worth over ten million yuan. Hu Caizhi, a "lookout," and Yuan Yinfu, a cook, were arrested at the scene. They confessed that the goods being transported by the barge were indeed stolen by Gong Shanqi, the "captain" of the ship. The principal offender and the unloading workers involved in the theft have fled after hearing the news. Hu Caizhi and Yuan Yinfu have been transferred to the police station for further interrogation. Their written testimonies have been submitted to Wu Guozhen, the chairman of the Port Affairs Committee, for review. The General Storage and Transportation Bureau has been notified to apprehend the principal offender, Long Shanqi, on bail.

If the public has urgent letters after the operating hours of other post offices, they can go to the kiosk to mail them before 11:00 PM. The kiosk was established on the 27th of this month.

<p>According to China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) sources, airmail sent from Shanghai to the United States via the Philippines was previously transported to Manila by CNAC's China-Philippines flights, and then transferred to Pan American World Airways' Pacific route flights to the United States. However, Pan American's flights were suspended from October 3rd. Furthermore, the Philippine Post Office only had a contract with Pan American for transporting mail to the United States, which caused some delays for mail arriving in the Philippines. CNAC has now received notification from the Philippine Pan American office that, starting November 5th, all mail arriving in the Philippines will be transferred by the Philippine Post Office to the US Air Transport Command (ATC) aircraft for transport to the United States. Once Pan American's flights resume, the mail will again be transported by that company. Therefore, mail to the United States will be unobstructed.</p>

<h3 id="e118">Unfinished Business of Housing Allocation Committee: Municipal Government Takes Over, Nearing Completion <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] After the Housing Allocation and Management Committee of the Executive Yuan ended in mid-October, its unfinished business was taken over by the General Affairs Department of the Municipal Government. The reporter visited the person in charge of the department yesterday afternoon to inquire about the progress of the work over the past two months. According to them, the department handles housing allocation matters in accordance with the principles of Mayor Wu's instructions: (1) No more housing will be allocated, and no occupancy permits will be issued. (2) Investigate and deal with disputes over housing already allocated by the Housing Allocation Committee. (3) Investigate and revoke any occupancy permits that were mistakenly issued by the former Housing Allocation Committee.</p>
<p>It is reported that the department has discovered more than ten cases of mistakenly issued permits, most of which involved people who moved in before April 20th of this year, before the Housing Allocation Committee was established, and who had signed legal leases with the owners. According to the scope of housing allocated by the Housing Allocation Committee of the Executive Yuan, it was limited to civilian houses previously occupied by the Japanese enemy, totaling about six to seven thousand buildings. The Housing Allocation Committee allocated one to two thousand buildings to various government agencies. Its unfinished business is largely completed. Therefore, the housing allocation takeover by the General Affairs Department of the Municipal Government will also be announced to be completed in January next year. Furthermore, the department specifically announced yesterday that residents who have been allocated housing by the former Committee of the Executive Yuan for the Allocation of Shanghai Agencies can quickly negotiate a lease with the owner, holding the temporary permit issued by the Committee. If the owner refuses to sign a contract, they can promptly send a letter to the Real Estate Department of the Central Trust Bureau to uniformly lease the property on their behalf within this year.</p>
<h3 id="e119">To Improve Communication Between the Banks of Suzhou River, A Plan for the Construction of Several New Bridges <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] In the Puxi area of the city, the Suzhou River is a barrier in the middle, resulting in the formation of two districts, north and south of the river. East of Xizang Road, there are more bridges across the river, so north-south transportation is relatively convenient, and the Hongkou area is more prosperous. West of Xizang Road, there is only the Xinzha Bridge for crossing the river, so the Zhabei area is relatively deserted. Those traveling from Zhabei to Huxi and the southern city mostly cross the river along the bridges in the eastern district, which increases the traffic burden on the Huangpu district. The traffic on Nanjing Road and Zhongzheng Road is extremely congested, and this is one of the reasons for it.</p>
<p>Zhao Zukang, the director of the Municipal Bureau of Public Works, in view of this, in addition to having drafted a transportation plan for the banks of the Suzhou River, preparing to implement it step by step, specially accompanied Lu Jifang, the director of the Road Department of the Bureau, and Zhu Guoxi, the director of the Structural Department, yesterday afternoon to conduct an on-site inspection, and closely studied the Bureau's near-term engineering plan to improve transportation between the north and south banks of the Suzhou River. It is reported that the plan includes the construction of bridges at Jiangxi Road, Hengfeng Road, Fujian Road, and Changshou Road, as well as bridge site issues, the renovation of the entire Suzhou Road surface, revetments, and the widening and renovation of Jiangxi Road, Chengdu Road, Huasheng Road, Hengfeng Road, Zhongzheng North Second Road, Changshou Road, and Guangzhao Road. The total cost of the plan is more than 9 billion yuan, which will soon be submitted to the Municipal Council for review. After the completion of this plan, the eight to nine thousand acres of land benefited in the Zhabei area, just considering the land value increase, could reach at least 40 to 50 billion yuan, which would greatly alleviate the traffic congestion in the Huangpu district.</p>

The Shanghai-Ningbo line liner was also delayed. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Jiangjing arrived from Ningbo yesterday. It should have arrived at around 8:00 AM, but was delayed until around 12:00 noon. It sailed to Ningbo as usual at around 5:00 PM yesterday afternoon. The Da Hua wheel of Ping An Bureau was delayed by fog until 2:00 PM yesterday afternoon. Since it could not sail to Ningbo, it was rescheduled to sail to Ningbo at 2:00 PM this afternoon. Therefore, the next sailing is also changed to this Sunday. If the weather clears, the 246 schedule will continue to be exported next week. China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Haihan wheel, returning to Shanghai from Tianjin, when entering Wusongkou at around 2:00 AM on the 25th, the front hold touched something unknown, there was a bang, and the whole ship shook. As a result, the bottom of the bow hold was slightly damaged, and there was a slight ingress of water. After importing in the afternoon of the day before yesterday, it docked at the Jinliyuan Wharf to unload the goods. After the goods are unloaded, inspection and repairs will be carried out, and the sailing period to Tianjin will be delayed for a few days.

The first flight is planned to transport the team's staff and materials to Guangzhou. The team's headquarters is located in Guangzhou. Currently, there are 111 tons of medical supplies in Guangzhou and 4 tons of medical supplies in Hankou, all of which urgently need to be transported to the interior.</p>
<p>According to the person in charge of the team: The team plans to fly two shifts per day per aircraft in the future, which means that each route can transport 12 tons of materials per day, 300 tons per month. From mid-January next year, it is hoped that each route can transport 1,000 tons per month. However, the UNRRA authorities believe that air transport costs are very high and do not intend to transport large quantities. It is limited to urgently needed relief supplies and those places where there are no other means of transportation available. According to China National Aviation Corporation's routes, air transport costs are high compared to water or rail transport. For example, from Guangzhou to Guilin, air transport costs 383,000 yuan per ton, while water transport costs 131,797 yuan per ton. From Guangzhou to Hankou via Guilin, the cost is 1 million yuan per ton, while rail transport costs 411,000 yuan per ton.</p>
<p>The team's Guangzhou host is currently studying and will decide on the principles and work plan for transporting materials.</p>

<p>Sufficient Stock, Store Sales Turn Slack, Rice Market Gradually Stabilizes; Oil Prices Also Plunge in a Straight Line Yesterday</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The rice market stabilized yesterday. A total of 3,230 dan arrived in the northern city, and 5,328 dan arrived in the southern city. In terms of prices: In the southern city, under negotiation, there was only a slight black market for the cooked rice in the northern city. Initially, it was 67,000 yuan, and then it dropped to 65,000 yuan. The reason for the black market was the relatively small amount of goods arriving due to rain, and rumors of pulling boats to transport grain. The previous rumor that rice prices in the production area were higher than in the city was also true, but it is understood that the price increase in the production area was due to the stimulation of the Shanghai rice market turmoil, which is not a concern if the Shanghai rice price is stable. The estimated amount of rice stored by the people in the city is at least 300,000 dan, and the rice that the city government can control, including those in Shanghai and on the way, is almost no less than 2 million dan. With good distribution, it can supply the city for four or five months. The prospect of people's food is very optimistic.</p>
<p>Also reported, as red gold declined and funds were tight, people's hearts softened, and store hoarding suddenly loosened.

<p>Also reported that since the gold and banknote market prices fluctuated in recent days, the prices of other goods have mostly risen with it, especially in terms of people's livelihood necessities, both rice and flour have exceeded the negotiated prices. The municipal authorities, recognizing that the situation is serious, have paid close attention to it and have sent cadres to the markets to secretly monitor them. If there are any off-market black market transactions, they will be severely punished. Therefore, the market disturbances in the two cities yesterday and today have gradually subsided. According to the person in charge of the Social Bureau, it was decided to convene a rice and flour price review meeting this week, and to make every effort to help dredge the source of materials, so as to balance supply and demand. At the same time, the supervision of sales in various markets will be strengthened to ensure that no materials flow into the black market. For legitimate merchants, in addition to providing reasonable profits, they will be guided into the right track at any time.</p>

<h3 id="e131">Construction Bank Short Nine Billion Yuan, Exchange Suspended <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The Shanghai branch of the Construction Bank at 200 Nanjing Road was finally suspended from exchange by the exchange house yesterday due to a shortage of 9 billion yuan in the bill exchange house. The bank also posted a notice at the entrance: It briefly stated: "The branch has recently been experiencing extremely tight silver. It is not easy to recover the released loans. It is forced to temporarily suspend the exchange, collect debts, and return deposits. It has also requested the head office to transfer funds for assistance. Once the deployment is in place, the original state will be restored immediately. All branch offices and sub-branches of the bank will continue to operate as usual. Notice is hereby given." It was found that the bank was founded in Chongqing in May of the 30th year of the Republic of China by Sun Linfang and others. The initial capital was 2 million yuan, and then the capital was increased three times in succession. By December of the 34th year of the Republic of China, the capital was increased to 100 million yuan. On March 26th of the 35th year of the Republic of China, the Shanghai line was established. On June 1st, the head office also moved to Shanghai to work. On June 10th, the Shanghai line officially opened and held business license No. 3204. Currently, in addition to the Chongqing head office, there are branches in Xi'an and Neijiang. In addition to the Nanjing Road branch in the city, there are also two sub-branches at 795 Nanjing West Road and 963 Linsen Middle Road. The current chairman and general manager is Sun Linfang, and the Shanghai line manager is Fan Yupan.</p>
<h3 id="e132">Sichuan Banks Operate Stably, Rumors of Instability are Untrue <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>Recently, a major figure in the Sichuan silver industry told reporters that the recent rumors that Sichuan banks are unstable are not true. The branches of the Sichuan banks in Shanghai have their loans released annually by the head office. Therefore, at the end of the year, this portion of the loans only needs to be collected and returned to the head office. Therefore, there may be a tightening of the bank's silver, but there is no phenomenon of illiquidity. Also, the Sichuan banks' business has always been conservative and normal, and rarely goes beyond the scope of the bank's legitimate business. Therefore, in recent days, the daily exchange amount has been doubled in preparation to prevent any eventuality. The banks that were passively shaken in the Daily Report cannot be included in the Sichuan banks, because they were newly established by expatriates who resided in Chongqing during the Anti-Japanese War. It is a pity that the outside world does not understand the truth and confuses them.</p>

<p>According to the person in charge of China Textile Corporation, after the establishment of China Textile Corporation, through continuous efforts, it now owns more than 2 million spindles, which is one-half of the total number of spindles in the country. Among them, Shanghai is the center, accounting for more than 1.2 million spindles. Tianjin China Textile Corporation has a total of seven factories, which were reorganized from 16 enemy and puppet textile factories, with a total of 320,000 spindles. The second is Qingdao, with 300,000 spindles. So far, about six-tenths of the total have started work. China Textile Shanghai Company has a total of 19 textile printing and dyeing plants. Due to power restrictions, only more than 560,000 spindles have started work. The cotton production period is approaching, and the company has sent personnel to various cotton producing areas to purchase domestic cotton. According to estimates, the total number of domestic cotton purchased this season is about 5 million dan. In addition to supplying local needs, only about 1 million dan will flow to the market. The company's target for purchasing domestic cotton this period is 800,000 dan, but it is still less than half of the raw materials needed for production, so it still needs to purchase American cotton with foreign exchange. It is reported that the steps of China Textile's production increase plan for next year are (1) to purchase its own generators. It is now actively installing four small turbine generators in China Textile Factory No. 16, with a total power generation of 4,000 KVA, which is only enough to supply the factory's electricity needs. In the future, it will continue to contact the Executive Yuan Materials Supply Bureau to purchase generators for installation, (2) to collect as much domestic cotton as possible, save foreign exchange, and seek self-sufficiency in raw materials.</p>

It is understood that the Bureau has notified all entrusted banks to comply.</p>

<p>The Board of Directors of the Four Joint Banks recently held a meeting and resolved to lend 1.5 billion yuan to the Shandong Luda, Yuesheng, and Boda coal mines taken over and operated by the Resources Committee to meet the urgent production needs of the mines. All the assets of the mines are used as collateral, and the operating income of each mine is used as repayment funds. The Bank of China and the Bank of Communications each bear half of the loan, with a term of six months, and are allowed to handle re-mortgaging at 70% to the Bank of China. It is reported that the scale of the mines is quite large, but the war caused extremely heavy damage. After the Resources Committee took over, it planned to purchase a large amount of equipment and materials, and the need for funds was urgent, so it borrowed a large amount of money from the Four Joint Banks. The production volume of the mines can reach as high as 50,000 tons of coal per month, which will be of great benefit to solving the fuel panic in the Beijing-Shanghai area in the future.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The Social Affairs Bureau has considered replacing caustic soda with soda ash because the supply of caustic soda in the city cannot meet demand, and has asked the Yongli Chemical Company to provide detailed reports on related issues for research reference. It is reported that the British company, because the quantity of alkali supplied to various chemical plants is very large, it is difficult to make any further contributions. The import quantity of caustic soda is very small. Britain was originally a major producing country, but now, due to the coal shortage, the production of alkali is far less than before, and exports have sharply reduced. The United States, because of its small domestic production volume, cannot export. This is the main reason for the current shortage of caustic soda in our country.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The Import and Export Industry Seafood Group Meeting has been held. The industry believes that seafood comes from Southeast Asia, and the capacity of Indian ports is not very large, so European ships passing through India often do not stop, resulting in the fact that as of November 17, there is still a lot of seafood in India that has not been shipped. Moreover, foreign seafood is listed as a prohibited import, resulting in a sharp drop in the selling price of seafood in India, and importers have suffered heavy losses, making it difficult to advance or retreat. After this meeting, it was decided to submit a request to the Transportation Management Committee to consider the special difficulties in transportation faced by the industry and handle it leniently. It is also learned that there are a large number of import applications for goods ordered before the announcement of the new import and export order, but the manpower of the Transportation Management Committee is insufficient, and very few import licenses have been issued, which also makes importers feel quite anxious.</p>

<p>According to a person in charge of the Yizhong Cigarette and Tobacco Factory in this city, since a large number of American cigarettes have been imported into our country, the domestic cigarette industry has been in decline. Although the production and sales of domestic cigarettes are not as good as those of American cigarettes, the main reason is that the costs and tax rates are too high. Among the costs, labor is the largest, especially the year-end bonus issue, which makes major cigarette factories feel difficult. As for the tax rate, it has reached 100%, and there is talk that the tax bureau will adjust it again. In order to solve the above difficulties, the Cigarette Industry Association has decided to hold an emergency meeting of all members at the Association at 3:00 PM today. It is hoped that a proper solution can be discussed for the year-end bonus issue for workers. It is said that many of the city's 86 cigarette factories are unable to operate. The city's cigarette industry has more than 30,000 workers.

<p>New Qihong is quiet. High-grade aged Qimen, although British export firms are coming in, it is a pity that goods are scarce and supply is lacking. As for green teas such as Chouzhen and Zhenmei, since the business authorities of the Central Bank reached an agreement with the French economic delegation for several hundred tons a few days ago, and they have also designated shipment to areas such as Africa's Gabon, several export firms that have taken on the contracts are still actively buying. In terms of selling prices, those in possession of goods are taking the opportunity to raise prices, and most are better than before. However, new Chouzhen and new Zhenmei and other varieties have already reached their peak and cannot advance further. They can only be stable.</p>

<p>President Jiang's Instructions</p>
<p>Dear attendees of the International Cultural Cooperation Association, I hope to promote international cultural exchange in order to enhance sympathy and mutual assistance, and to maintain the collective security of mankind, which is the common belief of all nations in the world today. Our country's position is closely related to the peace of the East and the world, and is of great importance. Communicating culture should be taken as a matter of utmost urgency. The establishment of your association today has profound meaning in the cultural history of the future. In the past 30 years, world academic thought and scientific inventions have made unprecedented progress. It is necessary to catch up quickly and without stopping, so as to avoid being left behind, competing without a strategy. Our traditional culture is long and lasting, and the thoughts of the sages are broad, profound and subtle. The relics of ancient cultural relics are also extremely comprehensive and rich, and should be promoted and developed, so as to achieve the effect of pushing oneself and others to be inseparable. For the advantages of the cultures of various nations, we should choose the strengths of all to learn from the mistakes of others. Only in this way can we converge the sources of Eastern and Western cultures and make a powerful contribution to all mankind in the new era. Due to the high level of scientific development, the distance between nations is getting closer, diplomatic relations are becoming more frequent, and cultural relations are becoming closer. How to seek reconciliation and cooperation, and consider the similarities and differences, in order to enhance the friendly spirit between nations, is the mission entrusted to all of you today. You are cultural pioneers and elites in the academic world, and your association is a new and new organization in the cultural circles of our country. You must have grand words and unique insights, and give full play to them, in order to promote world harmony with cultural power. On the occasion of this grand meeting, I would like to offer you this meaning and hope to encourage each other.</p>
<h3 id="e165">Yesterday's Symposium Held by the City's Cultural and Educational Circles to Discuss Textbook Issues; Prominent Educator Zheng Xiaocang Also Attended <a href="#e165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Yesterday (the 26th), at 9:00 PM, the city's cultural and educational circles held a symposium at 851 Yuyuan Road to discuss textbook issues. Attendees included Ou Yuanhuai, Shen Yougan, Zhang Yaoxiang, Huang Shijin, Chen Qingshi, Gu Shusen, Shen Baiying, Yu Qingtang, Gao Junshan, Chen Heqin, Zheng Xiaocang, Yang Zhixian, Zhang Yiqu, Fang Shannong, Sun Huaizong, Zhang Wenyu, Fu Tongxian, Liu Dajie, Dong Renjian, Liu Ganliang, Li Ximou, Chen Weixiong, Yu Zhenying, and twenty-three others. First, Mr. Chen Heqin announced the symposium's outline, its main purpose being to discuss textbook issues. Following this, Mr. Gu Shusen reported, stating roughly that the "National Standard Textbooks" originated before the war. The Ministry of Education only considered them a standard version and did not refer to them as "National Standard Textbooks." The term "National Standard Textbooks" was actually coined by outsiders. At the time, only the Chinese language textbook for senior elementary schools was printed and distributed on a limited scale. However, with the outbreak of the War of Resistance, a plan was devised, based on national policy, to completely control the printing and distribution. During the war, seven publishing houses, including Commercial Press, Chung Hwa Book Company, Zhengzhong, World Book Company, Datong, Kaiming, and Wentong, were responsible for printing and distribution, each forming a "Seven-Company Alliance." After the victory, four more publishing houses were added: Children's Press, Culture Press, Independent Press, and Victory Press, effectively opening it up to an "Eleven-Company Alliance." The Ministry of Education, due to proposals from the Political Council, once advocated for free opening, but due to various factors, a thorough and appropriate plan is still being carefully considered. Later, Mr. Chen Xiqin raised three questions: (1) Textbook editing issues: the advantages of National Standard Textbooks versus approved textbooks; (2) Textbook distribution issues: the importance of free and open systems versus the implementation of control; (3) Textbook content issues: a review of the current curriculum standards. Each expert expressed their views, leading to lively discussions until past 11:00 PM before the meeting adjourned.</p>
<p>Another report: Before the symposium last night, Mr. Chen Heqin hosted two banquets to welcome the renowned educator Zheng Xiaocang, who recently returned from the United States. During the banquet, he elaborated extensively on current university education issues. Mr. Zheng advocated that universities should not operate behind closed doors in the future but should open their doors and connect with the public. His words were very insightful. After the banquet, Mr. Zheng attended the symposium to participate in the discussion of textbook issues.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The finals of the Jingwu Cup 5th All-Shanghai Individual Table Tennis Championship, involving the top two players from each of the five groups, were held yesterday at 7:00 PM in the gymnasium on the fourth floor of the Cishu Building. The referees were Chen Linsheng and Chen Limao, and the inspector was Dai Yongquan. There were six groups of matches. About 300 spectators were present. The venue was small and could not accommodate everyone, and more than 100 people were kept out, making it a very popular event.</p>
<p>In the first group, Wang Youxin played against Fan Liangji. Wang was considered the most likely champion of this year's tournament, while Fan was an unexpected dark horse. Therefore, the difference in skill was significant, and Fan was easily defeated by Wang. In the second group, Zhang Fuwei played against Chen Xingquan. The match was quite tense. Zhang narrowly won the fifth game at 9-9, thanks to a lucky spin serve. Although Chen lost, he still impressed. In the third group, Yang Kaiyun played steadily and defeated Hu Yiping with ease. In the fourth group, Shui Hangao started strong but then declined. Each player won one game. Shui was leading 8-3 in the third game, but he was taken advantage of due to his carelessness. Hangao's skills were originally strong, but it was a pity that he often lacked concentration. In the fifth group, Chen Zengliang lost 3-0. In the last group, Chen Xingquan won the first game against Wang Youxin. Youxin then fought back and played very intensely and excitingly, ultimately winning 3-1. Xingquan had both offense and defense last night, and his spirit was also good. The results of each group are as follows:</p>
<p>Group 1: Wang Youxin defeated Fan Liangji 3-0</p>
<p>Group 2: Zhang Fuwei defeated Chen Xingquan 3-2</p>

<p>[Agence France-Presse, Melbourne, 26th] The Davis Cup finals were held here today. The sky was overcast and the weather was sultry. No fewer than 14,000 fans came to watch. At 1:30 PM, the players from the US and Australia entered the arena. The band played the Australian and American national anthems. Brock, chairman of the Australian Lawn Tennis Association, gave a speech, recalling the contributions of Davis, the donor of the cup. The whole audience observed a minute of silence. The opening ceremony was completed, and the competition continued immediately. In the first group, Australia's Bromwich played against the US's Shroude. Bromwich was an Australian national player and was expected to win, but he lost unexpectedly. The score was 3-6, 6-1, 6-2, 0-6, 6-3. At the beginning of the match, Bromwich served first and everything went smoothly. He won the first set in 23 minutes. Shroude emerged in the second set and gave a brilliant performance, which was unprecedented. Although the next three sets became a battle of attrition, both sides used long shots and never volleyed. In the second group, the US's Kramo played against Australia's Hansu Pierce. Kramo was more skilled and won 8-6, 6-2, 9-7. According to the results of today's two matches, the Davis Cup is implicitly in the hands of the United States, because Kramo's match against Pierce on the 28th will be an easy victory. The United States will have won three of the five matches. Although the results of the remaining singles and doubles matches are difficult to predict, they are no longer relevant to the overall victory.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Melbourne, 26th] The Davis Cup tennis finals were held today on the tennis court at the Kooyong Sports Ground. The 14,500 seats in the sports ground were packed to the brim during today's competition, making it one of the days with the largest audience in Davis Cup history.</p>

However, four people with different strengths in each group had to reach the finish line at the same time to qualify. Now, in order to increase competition, it has been changed to one fast runner, one medium runner, and one slow runner in each group, for a total of 16 groups. The top six groups will be awarded prizes. The organizers have also been hired, all of whom are experienced people in the sports world. The list of team groupings is recorded below:</p>

<p>— A Special Dispatch from Xi'an on the 8th by Air, Our Correspondent Shao Shenzhi</p>
<p>I arrived in Yao County late at night. Although there were small shops outside the city, lodging was impossible, and it was necessary to knock on the gate to enter. At this time, the sky was as black as ink, one could not see one's hand in front of one's face, the desolate wilderness was plunged into night, and only the sound of dogs barking in the cold could be heard in the fields.</p>
<p>Yao County city is built alongside the Qi River, with very high walls and battlements. To enter the city, one must cross the Qi River, and there is also a palisade gate on this bank. To knock on the city gate, one must first knock on the palisade gate. The so-called fortified line is only a little over ten li from the city. In the morning, in Sanyuan, someone in the army told me, "When you get to Yao County, you may still hear gunfire. Just now there was a phone call saying that the Communist army is attacking the Datong line." Now I have arrived at this "important place," and it is already late at night. I expected it to be heavily guarded, so I planned how to "earn" my way through the gate. I draped a woolen blanket over my shoulders and used a flashlight to explore the way forward.</p>
<p>Earning Entry to Yao Gate at Night - Palisade Gate Opened Under Red-Tasseled Spears</p>
<p>After walking for a while, I heard a loud challenge for the password in the darkness. I shined the flashlight over and saw it was a red-tasseled spear, wielded by a member of the civilian self-defense force dressed in black. He stood with his spear across the palisade gate, blocking the way. I explained where I was coming from and that I needed to enter the city. The red-tasseled spear replied, "This palisade gate is locked. Go look to the north." So I walked north for a while and encountered another red-tasseled spear. I thought that if this one was also locked, I would have to find a way to get him to unlock it. Unexpectedly, the palisade gate was ajar. I exchanged a few brief words with the red-tasseled spear. Upon hearing that I was from Sanyuan, he opened the gate without hesitation.</p>
<p>I crossed the Qi River on a flat stone bridge, then climbed a very steep, long slope. At the top of the slope was the city gate, bolted tightly shut. After calling out, a head emerged from the crack in the gate and spoke to me. If I told him I was a reporter from Shanghai, he would not understand and would not open the gate. So I told him I was from the commissioner's office here, returning to the city from Sanyuan on urgent official business. It did not seem as heavily guarded as I had imagined. While I was negotiating, two soldiers came up behind me. They took my place and spoke to the head in a commanding tone, ordering him to open the gate. The gate gradually opened, and I saw that the head belonged to a soldier armed with a loaded gun.</p>
<p>We quickly entered the gate. The city was completely dark and as silent as death. Along the way, at street corners and alleyways, we encountered many more red-tasseled spears. With the help of a soldier, I managed to get someone to open the door of a bathhouse that also served as a hotel. The owner was sleepy-eyed and made hissing noises between his teeth as he made up a bed and brewed tea for me. Looking at the state of this hotel, I understood the poverty of social life in Yao County, the so-called "gateway to northern Shaanxi." The water was salty, the bedding was black, and the kang was cold. Coupled with the snowy weather, it added to the desolation.</p>
<p>During the Song Dynasty, Generals Han Qi and Fan Zhongyan established their headquarters in Yan'an to defend against the three northern tribes. The so-called Hundred and Two Qin Passes, of which the Golden Lock Pass on the Cheng-Yu Road was one, were used to defend the border. Defending the border outside the Hundred and Two Qin Passes was a life of distant garrison. When the situation was unfavorable, Fan Zhongyan established his headquarters in Yao County, then called Yao Prefecture, within the pass. "Old Master Fan had tens of thousands of soldiers in his belly," and the people of Yao County greatly admired Fan Zhongyan. The current county government is located where he established his headquarters. The place where this famous general of the western frontier held court and reviewed his troops still exists, now with a plaque that reads "Jing Fan Tang," which has become the county government's courtroom. The courtyard is narrow and crowded, with an old cypress tree. The light is dim, and it faces the drum tower in the center of the city, which is only a hundred paces away.</p>
<p>It makes one feel the atmosphere of a border town in the past, as if one can hear the sound of metal clashing and horses galloping.</p>
<p>However, Yao County is in Guanzhong, not a border town of the Han or Tang dynasties, but during the Eastern Han Dynasty, there were also Western Qiang tribes, and the entire Guanzhong region was considered a border area. A border town in the heartland, times have changed and landscapes have shifted, and thousands of years have unknowingly passed. Outside the city, the Qi and Ju Rivers flow murmuring, telling of the vicissitudes of life. It has always been "far" from Chang'an. Although it is now connected by railway, transportation is still difficult. The people of Yao County ultimately look back to the past, believing in myths and legends.</p>

<h3 id="e183">City of Myths <a href="#e183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>Yao County also has a "forest" of steles, a collection of more than sixty stone tablets by a dedicated individual, housed in a solitary, dark, and dimly lit building, like a cave. Among them are Northern Wei Dynasty votive inscriptions, with bizarre and unrestrained strokes, unlike the Longmen Grottoes, which still have some elegant and graceful pieces. However, there are two extremely complete "Thousand Buddha" steles. One cannot compare these to the scale of Yungang or Dunhuang, but they are carved neatly and meticulously. The thousands of identical bas-relief Buddha images equally demonstrate the depth of Buddhist culture and the surging tide of thought. In addition, there are several Sixth Dynasty stone Buddhas with broken legs and feet. There are also more than a dozen ragged People's Republic of China infantrymen, looking like beggars. Some of them, like the Sixth Dynasty stone Buddhas, sit at the base of the wall in front of the solitary building, watching the red-tasseled spears drilling on a large parade ground, chanting "one, two, three, four." Others pile up dead branches and yellow leaves next to the Wei stele, burning them for warmth, the smoke stinging the eyes, nose, and throat. I squeezed into this small house that had become a smoke-filled cave, and with tears in my eyes, I finished looking at the steles and stone Buddhas with their bizarre strokes. This group of living stone Buddhas stood up and said to me:</p>
<p>"What should we do? Officer." I also didn't know what to do. After talking with them, they all began to complain endlessly. They said that they were originally from the 22nd Army, stationed in Toulin, because "the Eighth Route Army attacked us" and they were captured. "So many Eighth Route Army soldiers came! How could we not be defeated?" I said, didn't Xi'an send troops to rescue you? "That was after we surrendered that they came to rescue us!" They said, "The Eighth Route Army said to us: Why are you fighting? You were defeated before the rescue troops arrived. If you are willing to join the Eighth Route Army, stay here. If you are not willing, we will send you back. We don't want to join. They sent us here all the way, and they let us eat our fill. But when we got here, the county government only gives each person two steamed buns a day. How can we eat our fill? They still don't trust us. It's cold!"</p>
<p>So that was it. No wonder they were asking this "officer" what to do. They wear their suspicions on their sleeves, burdened with two steamed buns, unsure if it is relief or punishment. I asked around for them in this small town, but I couldn't find a solution. It seemed the solution had already been decided: inaction and letting nature take its course.</p>
<p>The people of Yao County consider themselves to live in the middle of a boat. The Northwest lacks water, so they imagine that the place where they live is a boat. They say with reason: Look, there is the Ju River and the Qi River, the county seat is like a boat floating in the middle. In some unknown era, a well was dug in the county government, and the boat leaked. Yao County was flooded, so they quickly filled it in and cast an iron ox to weigh down the boat, so that it would not sway in the water and that they can live in peace. I indeed saw an iron ox. This has more practical meaning than the ark mentioned in the Old Testament. They also boast of the Tang Dynasty calligrapher Liu Gongquan and the Sui Dynasty scholar Sun Simiao, whom the people of northern Shaanxi piously worship as the Medicine King. The Liu family north of the city was originally the hometown of Liu Gongquan, and this place name has been preserved from the Tang Dynasty until now.</p>
<p>Heading north from Sanyuan, the terrain continues to rise. From afar, it looks like a mountain, but climbing to the top of the mountain, it turns out to be a plain. Looking at the mountains further away, climbing them again, one finds another plain. There is a feeling of strength and ruggedness. This is the characteristic of the Qin-Long Plateau. The place names in this area are "something Yuan, something Yuan". The widespread use of the word "Yuan" began in Qin. South of Chang'an is Leyou Yuan, which in ancient Chinese literature represented idyllic scenery. But here, "Yuan" refers to a village or farmland, the edge of the Guanzhong Plain area. The Jinghui Canal area is blessed with natural advantages, and cotton can yield a world record of 120 catties per mu. But here, it is only 20 or 30 catties, a great difference, but still enough for a general standard. The soil is thin, the water conservancy is insufficient, and it depends on the heavens for harvest. There is a saying in Qin, "Eighty-three months of rain," meaning that every year it depends on rain in March, August, and the thirteenth month for a hopeful harvest. This saying is especially applicable to the barren areas north of Yao County.</p>
<p>These days the fortified line is tense. When I arrived, I didn't hear any gunfire. The commissioner and county magistrate shouted that it was terrible. When Commander-in-Chief of the Army Gu Zhutong came to Xi'an last time, he told them clearly: "If you lose the county government, defend the office. If you lose the office, defend the desk." This is the responsibility of the county magistrate. The inspection at the city gate is particularly strict.</p>
<p>A dilapidated county seat. The main streets were covered with horse and mule dung, allowed to dry easily, because harsh winter was about to descend. To the east of the city, there is a mountain named "Mount Wutai" to decorate the faith of the people of Yao County. Even more beautifully decorated is the Medicine King Temple, resplendent and magnificent. A wide road leads directly to the county seat, with incense burning throughout the year. The middle school students in the county seat kneel before the clay statues, shaking divination tubes, seeking prescriptions for someone in their family. Sun Simiao was undoubtedly a good doctor in the Tang Dynasty. According to the inscription on the Lingjing stele, Emperor Taizong once visited Sun and invited him to serve as an official, but Sun still lived in this hermitage. He praised Sun, saying, "If he does not become one of the three highest ministers, he will surely become a famous doctor." He was given the title "Perfected Man." Sun wrote the "Essential Recipes Worth a Thousand Gold," and Guo Si, a scholar of the Song Dynasty, had it engraved in Huazhou to widely disseminate it. Later, another set was engraved in the Taoist temple. These stone steles are as complete as before, because there are not many rubbings. The characters are clear, and they are all simple prescriptions. Among them, the "Maritime Prescription" stele contains Sun's pillow notes and health maintenance inscriptions, which are mostly in line with scientific principles. The main idea is quiet cultivation of life, revealing traces of the confluence of Confucian and Taoist thought. The backwardness of culture shows the strength of supernatural forces. The people of Yao County bring wine up the mountain to worship such temple gods, making the statues glow. Myths circulate, and life is impoverished. If someone were to close it down, they would undoubtedly be strongly opposed. Some people believe that it is better to be immersed in superstition than to be awakened; moreover, they do not know when they will find new salvation.</p>
<h3 id="e184">Wheat Fields on the Plateau - Public and Private Wasteland Open for Cultivation <a href="#e184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>The Xiantong branch line ends in Yao County. There are coal-carrying trains from Yao County to the coal mine in Wulipu, five li south of Tongguan, which also sell passenger tickets. From Wulipu to Jin Suo Guan in Tongguan, one must take a horse-drawn carriage.</p>
<p>Galloping on horseback on the plateaus in this area, looking at the boundless world, the rising status of the Northwest, with the full development of the interior from the coast, frees it from labels of closure and backwardness.</p>
<p>On the road north from Yao County to Jinsuo Pass, the wheat is green, but there is still so much wasteland. The government encourages reclamation, but after a flurry of activity, only slogans remain: "Public and private wasteland, open for cultivation." It has no great effect, because reclamation requires capital and labor, and promoting a new movement also requires organization. Over the years, the main theme of the county governments has been handling military levies, and they have been maintaining old production methods. Tongguan County alone has built two hundred bunkers, but the entire county has a population of only 56,000. Yao County has a population of only 50,000, Sanyuan less than 100,000, and Yijun less than 40,000, all with frightening burdens.</p>
<p>A highway generally follows the Qi River north, with mountains on both sides. Where the loess has been eroded, the Permian limestone layers are exposed, as well as conglomerate and shale. The wheat fields I saw were on both banks of the Qi River. Horses and mules running in the fields were not considered strange, nor was it considered strange for them to eat the wheat, but people from Jiangnan would inevitably find it strange. At this time, the farmers do not hope for rain or warmth, otherwise the wheat will grow too tall, and it will be difficult to expect a good harvest next year, because the soil is loose, and they are afraid that it will not be strong and will not produce grain. They even need to press it down with a roller, so these wheat plants are like piles of wild vegetables, flat and spread on the ground. At this time, they do not mind the trampling and grazing of horses, as long as it grows strong. The local saying here is: "Pigs in the first month, cats in the second month, women running all over the ground in the third month." In the first month, the crops have not sprouted, and pigs are allowed to run around. In the second month, cats are in heat and do not stay home. In the third month, farm women gather edible weeds everywhere. This is true throughout the wheat belt of the north.</p>
<p>The road was full of farmers driving mules, some transporting coal from the Jinsuo Pass area to Yao County, some carrying corn to the city to sell. There were absolutely no mule carts, the only convenient tool for travel, indicating that there were no travelers. The ancient road had a sense of the west wind, and the horse I was riding, borrowed from the army, was not thin. Traveling with these farmers, I had a strong feeling of "the soldiers are thin, and the warhorses are fat." They drove the mule herds, shouting loudly or scolding them intimately, the whips cracking, making the ancient road less lonely. Their shouts were mostly short commands, mostly a single sound, occasionally with a retroflex sound. They say that there are more than a hundred commands for driving mules, which cannot be recorded with writing or phonetic symbols. They can use commands to direct them to go left, right, fast, or slow, but when I learned their commands, I couldn't get the mules to move. They said, "The mules recognize the voice." The mules are all very fat. They said, "Good feed is better than bait." This saying means that as long as the grass is mixed evenly, the livestock will eat their fill, without the need for special bait.</p>
<p>They rely on their pitiful agriculture, the knowledge accumulated over generations of worshipping deities, and live their lives. Often there are many touching farm sayings buried in the Chinese countryside, and this place is no exception. They sing praises to wild grasses, saying: "Wormwood in the first month, motherwort in the second month, cut it in the third month and burn it as firewood." They describe the tender grass in the first month as fragrant as wormwood, and praise wormwood (a medicinal plant that can be used to make wine). The grass turns green in the second month, and the grass is lush after the third month, ready to be used as fuel, which is the season when the ground is frozen and the grass is yellow. As they spoke, I recorded a large number of proverbs. I felt that due to the difference in latitude, water conservancy, and geological climate, their hopes for rain and early harvests, or their predictions of the weather, were significantly different from those in Jiangnan.</p>
<p>They have their own names for animals and plants. Male pigs and dogs are called "tooth pigs" and "tooth dogs", while females are called "grass pigs" and "grass dogs". For cats, they are called "Lang cats" and "Nu cats". But male horses are called "er horses", and female horses are called "mu horses". Male mules are called "jiao mules", and females are called "cao mules". Middle-aged pigs have a special name, they call them "ka lang zi". Crickets are called "vinegar spiders", and ants are called "fart floating horses". These are all local dialects. They call polygala "wild lentils" and bupleurum "chicken tongue". They hate cuckoos, calling them "murderous robbers", because their calls are unpleasant and evoke no goodwill. They do not know the elegant name that scholars and poets give this bird.</p>
<p>Flocks of wild pigeons and pheasants gather in the wheat fields. They fly slowly, and there are many of them. If one had a hunting rifle, one could definitely harvest a good haul.</p>
<h3 id="e185">Tongguan Coal Mine <a href="#e185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>Last year on Double Tenth Day, Tongguan County was renamed Tongchuan County. When people from Shaanxi mention Tongguan, they specifically say "North Tongguan" because the pronunciation is the same as that of Tongguan. The telegraph office's Latin alphabet spelling encountered difficulties, often sending telegrams from the two counties to the wrong place. But Tongguan Coal Mine is still Tongguan Coal Mine.</p>
<p>Xi'an is experiencing a severe coal shortage, but in Yao County and Tongchuan, tens of thousands of tons of coal are piled up. The mixed coal costs four to five thousand yuan per ton, while the price in Xi'an is three times higher. Some employees on the Chengtong branch line have abandoned their work of waving red and green flags to sell coal, making three times the profit. I asked why the Longhai Railway couldn't transport the coal to Xi'an to alleviate the coal shortage this winter. The answer was that there were not enough cars. Currently, Tongguan Mine can produce an average of 650 tons per day, and the Longhai Railway needs 600 tons. That little bit extra cannot be shipped out. However, of the investment in Tongguan Coal Mine, two-thirds came from the Longhai Railway and one-third from the provincial government. According to the share capital calculation, the provincial government said that it should be given 200 tons. The coal merchants are very resourceful and can find a way to transport a little bit out, because the interest on the Longhai Railway is a disguised sale of train cars. Along the way, inspectors, switchmen, and even clerks extort money. Everyone at the station has great power. One switchman said that the train wouldn't leave if he didn't switch the tracks. Transportation is fraught with difficulties. The Longhai Railway is to blame for the absurdly high price of coal in Xi'an. Therefore, on the Xian-Yu highway, there are long-distance mule trains and handcarts transporting coal. Tongguan County has more than twenty private small mines. These peddlers only want large pieces, because they are easy to load and transport. Small pieces or crushed coal are piled up in the mines, and no one cares about them. The Longhai Railway has a Longhai Enterprise Company. The Japanese Manchurian Railway, which invaded the Northeast, used railways as the center to develop enterprises and do big business. The people of Shaanxi ask what kind of enterprise the Longhai Railway is. Just run the railway well. I heard that it has recently registered with the authorities.</p>
<p>When I arrived at the Wulipu Tongguan Government Coal Mine, the new and old mine managers were just completing the handover. The mine manager is decided by the council formed by the provincial government and the railway bureau. The new mine manager, Ma Qingyuan, is an old member of the Tongmenghui. From the time of the Shaanxi Jingguo Army to the extension of the central government's power into Shaanxi, his troops entered Xi'an and he served as the first garrison commander, and he always took a firm stance against Yang Hucheng. Before the victory, he was a counselor to the Military Affairs Commission? He retired this year and received a pension. "Without this pension, I wouldn't even be able to travel." This 54-year-old veteran said to me with a firm attitude: "Tongguan Coal Mine has made contributions during the War of Resistance, and it is the only large coal mine in the Northwest. We must take a long-term view and operate this mine from the standpoint of developing the Northwest." When it comes to coal quality, it cannot compare to Guanyintang in Henan, let alone Jiaozuo. It contains 5% sulfur and is semi-anthracite coal. He said, "If transportation becomes smooth in the future, and other mines become more flexible in supplying coal, this mine will have problems." However, he believes that standing from the point of developing the Northwest, one should not think opening one more mine is excessive. "And one can find ways to reduce costs and make the selling price cheaper."</p>
<p>There are more than 6,000 workers in this mine, with an average wage of only around 1,600 yuan per month. The monthly salary of engineers is only around 200,000 yuan. The treatment is low and should be increased immediately. The Longhai Railway takes 600 tons of coal and only pays the cost plus 20% profit, but the Longhai Railway is in arrears and does not allow the mine to sell coal itself. The losses of the Longhai Railway are compensated by the coal mine. So he sighed to me: "I've only been here for eight days, and I don't know the internal situation very well. I still feel that this problem is very serious. There are many personnel problems. The first thing now is to adjust the treatment. The disadvantage of government-run enterprises is that there are too many administrative staff, and sometimes their treatment is higher than that of engineering personnel. This is also an unreasonable phenomenon here. I have already told everyone that I am definitely not here to make money at the mine. If I take improper wealth, please report me to the staff."</p>
<p>Currently, there are four plants, twelve shafts, and several are abandoned shafts. Three shafts are contracted to merchants, and about seven are in operation. The power comes from several abandoned train engines. The materials and machines were put together during the war. If equipment is added, it is practically impossible to do so, and even if it is done, it will naturally increase production. If the transportation problem is not resolved, there is still no way to talk about development. The workers all live in cave dwellings. The cave dwellings are warm, and there are mosquitoes even in December. The mine's hospital has records that it diagnosed 7,800 cases of malaria-like infections last year. That is to say, on average, everyone has seen a doctor once. The second most common ailment is eye disease, followed by respiratory diseases. There have been thousands of diagnoses for each.</p>
<p>The mine area covers more than 2,600 hectares and is estimated to have reserves of 50 million tons. The entire Tongguan coal deposit belongs to the Carboniferous-Permian coal-bearing system, which runs across the large east-west anticline limestone, dividing it into northern and southern districts. After prospecting, it was found that the coal shafts, which were mined using primitive methods, had penetrated the coal-bearing system and reached the limestone. Observing the columnar section, the northern coal seam slopes northwest, high in the east and low in the west, low in the south and high in the north, with an average thickness of up to four meters and a total area of 44.7 million square meters. Taking a specific gravity of 1.3, multiplying these three numbers yields a total reserve of 284.44 million metric tons. If only half of it is minable, then a daily output of 4,000 metric tons can be mined for a century. However, at present, including more than twenty private small mines, the daily output is only 1,200 metric tons.</p>
<p>I ran to No. 1 shaft, which is more than 60 meters deep. There is no methane, so oil lamps can be used. This shaft is mined using the room and pillar method. The mine roadway has expanded to an area of 700 to 800 mu. Drainage is carried out in the natural pores of the limestone. The Tongguan rock layers are mostly soft shale and less hard shale, so only the room and pillar method can be used. The miners wear thick cloth on their heads and tie their lamps to their foreheads. The flames flicker as they push carts or drag coal baskets, wriggling like earthworms. This is also life. They work eight or twelve hour shifts. The primitive mines are operated by civilian labor. The workers change shifts every ten days or half a month. During the shift change, they eat and sleep at the bottom of the mine, never seeing the light of day. They are truly underground workers.</p>

<h3 id="e186">The Strategic Location of the Majestic Pass: One Sweepingly Commands a View of Chang'an to the South <a href="#e186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>The Guanzhong Plain, stretching from Tongguan to Ji, is what is called the Jing and Wei Plain. Its shape is similar to that between Shanghai and Nanjing, but its width is only tens of miles, and its area is only 40,000 square miles. (In my previous article, "Guanzhong Covered in Frost and Snow, Fields and Gardens," I mentioned the irrigation projects of the Shaanxi Provincial Water Conservancy Bureau. In addition, there are several canals assisted by the Shaanxi Provincial Agricultural Improvement Institute for local construction: the Wugong Weihui Canal, irrigating 2,000 mu of land; the Yunyang Leading-Flood Canal, irrigating 20,000 mu of land. This canal is built by damming and guiding mountain floods to irrigate the fields, and the mountain floods that rush down contain a unique amount of phosphorus fertilizer; the Weinan Huihui Canal, irrigating 20,000 mu of land, was built with funds allocated by the British China Aid Association and will be completed this winter; the Fuping Huihui Canal, irrigating 20,000 mu of land, can be opened for water next spring. The irrigation projects in Shaanxi are mostly these.) From Sanyuan to Yaoxian, after dozens of miles, you reach the edge of the plain. Climbing a mountain, you see a vast plain, which is actually the Loess Plateau. Reaching Tongguan, you enter the mountainous area, and it becomes even higher at Yijun, becoming the backbone separating northern Shaanxi from Guanzhong. In Yijun, you need to wear lined clothes even in summer. Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty built the Yuhua Palace there as a summer retreat. Going north from Yijun to Huangling and Luochuan, the terrain becomes lower again. The Jinshuo Pass, located between Yijun and Tongguan, stands majestically in the mountains, like a natural moat, becoming an important and strategic location since ancient times, which is not accidental.</p>
<p>The Guanzhong Plain is high in the west and low in the east, leaning against the Liupan Mountains in the northwest and separated by the Meridian Ridge in the north. The northern Shaanxi region, north of Tongguan and Yijun, is actually a basin, leaning against the Meridian Ridge, high in the west and low in the east, a stretch of loess and red soil, forming a good wheat-growing belt. Northern Shaanxi is isolated, and the people are poor, but the land is not barren, which is quite different from general perceptions. Since the Qin and Han dynasties, it has been abandoned by the Western Qiang. In successive dynasties, whenever there were affairs in the west, it was often regarded as a crucial area for military operations. Zuo Zongtang pacified the Hui people, and his subordinate Liu Songshan led troops north from Xi'an to Suide. After the Republic of China, there was also the so-called "Bandit Suppression" campaign. Li Zicheng rose from northern Shaanxi, not to mention. As a result, water conservancy was not maintained, education was not promoted, the imperial court regarded it as a border area, and officials regarded it as a daunting path. Guanzhong and northern Shaanxi, though geographically close, were worlds apart. Although there were fertile fields, they were not developed. Most of the northwest is like this, not just a corner of northern Shaanxi. Observing the scenery after water conservancy improvements in the Jinghui Canal area, and then riding a horse in front of the Jinshuo Pass, the bare hills are severely eroded, the gullies are crisscrossed, and the mounds could have been good farmland, but now they are all abandoned land. The court and the public engage in lofty political discussions, and wars continue endlessly. Opium is rampant on the blockhouse line, and the further north you go, the cheaper the price becomes. The withering of the people's livelihood can be imagined.</p>
<p>The terrain in the area the reporter passed through is extremely complex, and detailed surveying is most difficult. The Meridian Ridge meanders to Yijun and Tongguan. At first glance, they are all loess layers, but the southeastern area of Tongguan has a large portion of exposed red soil, which is likely the famous Sanmen Series red soil. The loess layer was originally covering the red soil and can be as thick as tens of meters, showing the severity of the erosion. The He Plateau looks like a mountain range from afar, but it is actually due to erosion and fragmentation. Often, two plains are separated by a deep valley, making it impossible to pass between them. You have to go a long way around, and the bottom of the valley becomes a road or wheat field again. A few hours of heavy rain can create a gully. Although the loess is thousands of feet high, seemingly indestructible, the ease of erosion is very estimable.</p>
<p>The county seat of Tongguan has only two thousand several hundred residents. Traveling thirty miles north from the city, you reach the Jinshuo Pass. Going west from the pass, it is only ten to twenty miles to Guanqian. The reporter originally planned to go north to Huangling, but at this time, the roads were mostly blocked, and there were frequent incidents. After traveling through seven counties in ten days, I could get a glimpse of the local customs, so I turned back to Xi'an. The Jinshuo Pass was built in the Song Dynasty. During the Qing Dynasty, for defense, there was only one garrison officer. Later, it was changed to one patrol officer, with twenty soldiers. Each soldier received only eight months of silver per year, one tael per month, and five shi of rice per year, supplied by the county. People in the county can still talk about it now, showing the difference in the burden between the past and the present. Now, the reporter rides a horse in front of the pass and sees only a section of the pass wall winding down the mountain. The two mountains converge, and the rocky cliffs become a steep and dangerous road. The old pass has been widened into a highway going north. The function of the "majestic pass" of the past has completely disappeared. Climbing the pass and looking around, the vastness of the eight directions is visible. Looking south from a high vantage point, everything is in full view. The border pass relics still have former barracks and cultivated land, with half a clump of decaying willows, resembling an old, gray-bearded soldier hoeing the foothills and watching the setting sun over the southern mountains.</p>

<h3 id="e187">A Brief Discussion on the Uses of Plasma <a href="#e187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>— Yi Jianlong</p>
<p>Significant progress was made in therapeutic drugs during World War II. This significant progress has provided a deeper layer of protection for human health and life. In terms of the order of progress, it can be said that the first is the synthesis and evolution of mineral preparations; the second is the preservation and unlimited use of plasma; and the third is the invention and mass production of penicillin. People in China clearly have a considerable understanding of the therapeutic value of the first and third points, but their understanding of the uses and methods of the second point seems to be superficial, and they may even abandon it due to improper use. In the early stages of the War of Resistance Against Japan, the author studied blood transfusion therapy with experts in the United States and Canada. After returning to China, he presided over the blood bank in Kunming for many years. Therefore, I will give a brief introduction based on my research and experience.</p>
<p>(1) Composition – To know the uses of plasma, one must first understand its effective components. Plasma is made from uncoagulated blood and is a mixture of colloidal and crystalline substances. Its effective components can be described as follows:</p>
<p>(A) Essential Nutrients – All nutrients that have been digested by the stomach and intestines must be absorbed and transported by plasma before they can reach the tissues of various parts of the human body. Furthermore, the remaining or stored nutrients in the tissues must also be absorbed and transported by plasma before they can enter the nutrient-deficient tissues. From this perspective, plasma is nothing less than a general stepping stone for nutrients. All the nutrients required by the human body, such as proteins, amino acids, fats, fatty acids, glucose, vitamins, and inorganic salts, should be readily available.</p>
<p>(B) Substances that Maintain Osmotic Pressure – The circulating blood volume of a healthy human body is always constant, accounting for 9% of body weight. The reason why it can be kept constant is mostly due to the osmotic pressure in the plasma. This osmotic pressure can prevent the exudation of fluids from the blood vessels, and it can also return the fluids that have already exuded back into the blood vessels. There are two substances in the blood that maintain osmotic pressure, namely proteins and salts.</p>
<p>(C) Hormones – Hormones are the mechanism for constantly adjusting changes in various parts of the human body. For example, thyroid and growth hormones control development, insulin controls carbohydrate metabolism, and ovarian hormones control fertility. These hormones originate in the endocrine glands and are then sent to various organs through the blood. Therefore, there are also hormones in the plasma.</p>
<p>(D) Various Enzymes – The human body's metabolism and antitoxic effects are mostly mediated by enzymes. There are many enzymes contained in plasma, the most notable of which is clotting enzyme.</p>
<p>(E) Various Antibodies – When the human body is attacked by bacteria, it produces antibodies that circulate in the plasma to fight against the bacteria. The types and amounts of antibodies in the blood vary from person to person. In the mixed plasma of the majority, the types and amounts of antibodies are generally greater.</p>
<p>(F) Other Life Elements of Unknown Origin.</p>
<p>(2) Uses and Methods – Knowing the effective components of plasma, its uses can be inferred. The uses and methods of plasma can be described as follows:</p>
<p>(A) Traumatic and Surgical Shock</p>
<p>The etiology of shock is still uncertain, but its significant pathological change, which is the escape of plasma out of the blood vessels, has been generally recognized. Due to the action of some malignant factors, the blood vessels dilate and their permeability increases, causing plasma to escape into the surrounding tissues. As a result, the circulating blood volume is greatly reduced, and the supply of oxygen and other nutrients to the tissues is insufficient. If not treated immediately, the patient will generally die within 9 to 12 hours. The effective method to treat shock is to quickly infuse plasma. American shock expert Dr. Scudder said: "If you do not transfuse blood when you should, death can be expected immediately; if you transfuse insufficient blood, it is all in vain." Blood specific gravity, hemocrit, and blood pressure are the standards for determining the timing and quantity of blood transfusion. If the blood specific gravity and hemocrit are higher than normal and the blood pressure drops to 70% below normal, it is clear evidence of hemoconcentration and a significant decrease in cardiac output. A large amount of plasma should be infused immediately until the three indicators return to normal. The expressions of shock patients in China are often not as obvious as those of Caucasians. Even when they are on the verge of death, their condition is calm as before. Therefore, laboratory tests and diagnosis are very important. If the patient can still eat and has no symptoms of dehydration, concentrated plasma or concentrated serum albumin can be instilled intravenously to increase the osmotic pressure within the blood vessels, so that the plasma that has permeated into the surrounding tissues returns to the blood vessels. To prevent the occurrence of surgical shock, it is best to infuse 300 to 500 cc of plasma before and after major surgery. This procedure has become an indispensable routine in the operating rooms of major hospitals in the United States.</p>
<p>(B) Hemorrhagic Shock</p>
<p>Internal and external injuries and bleeding can certainly cause shock, but massive hemoptysis, gastrointestinal bleeding, ectopic pregnancy bleeding, and metrorrhagia can also cause severe shock. The difference between this type of shock and the above shock is that the blood specific gravity, hemocrit, and blood pressure all decrease simultaneously. Under these circumstances, plasma should be rapidly instilled through multiple veins simultaneously to allow the patient to overcome the dangerous period, and then followed by the instillation of whole blood or red blood cells. If the circulating blood volume is lost by more than one-third, it can be life-threatening, and if the loss of red blood cells does not exceed 60%, it can still maintain its minimum gas exchange function.</p>
<p>(C) Burns or Scalds</p>
<p>The most severe burns or scalds can cause shock, so plasma should be instilled in addition to local treatment to stop the shock. Even after the shock has passed, plasma will continue to exude from the affected area. According to Dr. Scudder's estimate, if a third-degree burn covers one-third of the total body area, the plasma loss from the affected area in 24 hours will be more than 400 cc. To maintain the patient's normal blood volume, the instillation of plasma is essential. If the patient can still ingest fluids on their own, concentrated plasma should be used.</p>
<p>(D) Secondary Anemia</p>
<p>The treatment for this type of anemia is to eliminate its source and promote the production of red blood cells. To promote the production of red blood cells, it is necessary to supply as much raw materials for red blood cell production as possible, including proteins and iron. Plasma contains sufficient protein and other nourishing substances, which can supply part of the raw materials for red blood cell production, so it can be an adjunct to iron therapy.</p>
<p>(E) Malnutrition</p>
<p>In severe malnutrition, the protein in the blood is lower than normal. As a result, the water in the blood continues to seep into the surrounding tissues, forming edema throughout the body. For this type of disease, only repeated injections of concentrated plasma based on blood protein tests can quickly restore the patient.</p>
<p>(F) Protein Deficiency Syndrome</p>
<p>Protein deficiency syndrome is caused by fatty changes in the renal tubules. The blood protein of these patients is constantly excreted from the kidneys. Therefore, the protein in the blood is significantly reduced, which can also form edema throughout the body. These patients should also be treated with plasma. If the daily excretion of protein is more than 25 cc and the patient cannot ingest more protein, then 400 cc of plasma should be infused daily, because the protein in plasma is usually around 7%.</p>
<p>(G) Feverish Diseases</p>
<p>In patients with diseases such as typhoid fever, typhus, and tuberculosis, gastrointestinal digestion and absorption are abnormal, and the consumption of physical strength is large. As a result, there is a negative nitrogen balance. This pathological change not only reduces the patient's resistance but can also cause adverse complications. If plasma is injected continuously in addition to drinking more fluids, the patient's nutrition and resistance can be improved.</p>
<p>(H) Gastrointestinal Diseases</p>
<p>Whether or not these patients have undergone surgical treatment, if they cannot ingest more nutrients, they will inevitably deteriorate. The remedy is to continuously inject plasma to improve nutrition and promote the healing of the affected area. A sedentary adult needs at least 50 cc of protein per day, which is 700 cc of plasma. Healthy plasma contains 7 cc of protein per 100 cc.</p>
<p>(I) Acute Infectious Diseases</p>
<p>Mixed human plasma has various antibodies, so it can prevent measles, whooping cough, chickenpox, scarlet fever, erysipelas, and adenitis. Experiments by American pediatrician Dr. Bavenberg have shown that among 4,733 children who had been given measles vaccinations (each person injected with 20 to 40 cc of plasma intramuscularly), only six cases of primary measles were found, while among 11,280 children who had not been given measles vaccinations, 94 people contracted primary measles.</p>
<p>(J) Premature Infants</p>
<p>With the advancement of modern medicine, the lives of infants born less than six months after conception can also be maintained. In addition to regulating the temperature of the incubator, providing oxygen, and providing special nutrition, small amounts of plasma can be injected continuously.</p>
<p>(K) Increased Intracranial Pressure and Lumps in the Breasts</p>
<p>For these patients, if concentrated plasma or concentrated serum albumin can be injected continuously while reducing fluid intake, the results obtained are far better than treatment with magnesium sulfate laxatives.</p>
<p>Although plasma has many uses, there are also contraindications. If there is liver and kidney dysfunction, excessive blood pressure, congestive heart failure, or acute pulmonary edema, plasma infusion should be performed with caution, and large amounts are especially not advisable.</p>
<p>(3) Methods for Identifying the Quality of Plasma – After the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan, the U.S. military's surplus dry plasma also flowed into our country's market along with other surplus materials. It is difficult to tell which is superior and which is inferior, and modern pharmacopoeias do not have any identification methods. However, the quality of various products is uneven, which is unavoidable. To facilitate identification, I will briefly describe the identification method of dry plasma for the reference of users:</p>
<p>(A) Color – Expired dry plasma is a light, amorphous powder that is always straw yellow. It should not be used if it is coagulated, does not disperse, or has a pale green color.</p>
<p>(B) Unexpired dry plasma should dissolve completely within one minute after adding distilled water.</p>
<p>(C) Solution Turbidity – Turbidity is a common physical property of liquid plasma, but under an electric colorimeter, its turbidity should not exceed 700 degrees.</p>
<p>(D) Residual Moisture – The residual moisture in dry plasma should not exceed 1.0%.</p>
<p>(E) Non-pyrogenic – The so-called pyrogenic substances are bacterial corpses or bacterial secretions. If the equipment used to prepare plasma is not washed with special drugs, or the soda used to dissolve dry plasma is not disinfected with a special filter, fever cannot be avoided.</p>
<h3 id="e188">Protein Hydrolysates: Their Physiological Effects and Therapeutic Efficacy <a href="#e188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>— Lecture by Xu Zhaodui, Notes by Tao Shouqi</p>
<p>In-depth research on protein nutrition began more than forty years ago. At that time, famous scholars made contributions to the protein content of food, the transformation numbers of protein and nitrogen, the nitrogen balance of the body, and the biological value of protein. Later research also elucidated the analysis of amino acids, the identification of major amino acids, the relationship between protein and edema, and so on. However, previous work was largely scattered and unsystematic. Among them, Chittenden's research asserted that the human body's need for and tolerance of protein was quite low, which had a dangerous impact, because the general impression was that the protein required by the human body was extremely easy to meet. At that time, research on vitamins was developing rapidly and soon showed its importance. Therefore, general clinicians today only know to pay attention to vitamins and often neglect the importance of protein. Until recently, due to the application of novel and rapid protein detection methods, as well as the mass production and therapeutic development of protein hydrolysates, the topic of protein nutrition has once again aroused the interest and attention of the medical community.</p>
<p>The Main Functions of Protein: The main functions of protein for the human body are briefly described as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Maintaining Blood Volume – The Urgent Function of Protein: The protein in plasma is a colloidal substance, so it can produce an effective osmotic pressure to resist capillary blood pressure, so that the liquid in the blood vessels does not overflow excessively, and blood volume is maintained. At any wound site, in addition to bleeding, there is often exudation of plasma protein, which reduces the osmotic pressure of the blood and thus aggravates the reduction in blood volume.</p>
<p>(2) Maintaining Tissue Integrity: The results of research on bedsores have shown the importance of protein for tissue integrity. Patients with bedsores have excessively low blood protein and a negative nitrogen balance. If protein intake can be increased, so that the nitrogen balance turns positive, the bedsores will also heal accordingly, because tissues lacking protein nutrition have reduced vitality and are prone to collapse.</p>
<p>(3) Promoting Wound Healing: Protein deficiency affects the growth of fibrous tissue, making it difficult for any wound to contract. When the protein in the blood is excessively low after surgery, the wound often tends to break open. If the amount of protein intake can be increased, the wound will heal rapidly.</p>
<p>(4) Promoting the Production of Immunoglobulins, Endocrine Substances, and Enzymes: The existence of this function is only a hypothesis and needs to be clearly proven before it can be established.</p>
<p>(5) Function During the Recovery Period: Protein metabolism during the recovery period from illness often undergoes significant changes due to the action of the following factors: A. Patients who experience loss of appetite, nausea, or vomiting during illness may reduce their protein intake. B. The diet in hospitals often contains excessively low amounts of protein due to economic or other difficulties. C. Patients with gastrointestinal disorders have poor protein absorption. D. The Impact of Exudation – Any loss of fluid from the body is inevitably accompanied by a loss of protein, especially the fluid exuded from the surface of burns or large abscesses, which contains particularly high levels of protein. Therefore, patients with extensive burns or empyema often lose no less than 50 to 60 grams of protein per day. E. The amount of protein excreted in the urine during illness or injury is often several times higher than normal. From the above five points, it can be seen that the human body is often deprived of large amounts of protein during illness or injury. Therefore, it is necessary to replenish protein during the recovery period.</p>
<p>High-Level Nutritional Therapy: Natural diets usually contain about 10 grams of nitrogen per day, while high-protein diets contain 20 grams. Therefore, if the need for protein increases to a considerable extent under morbid conditions, it is by no means something that natural diets can cope with, and amino acids or protein hydrolysates must be given. When the need for protein intake exceeds the amount that natural foods can provide, it is called hyperalimentation.</p>
<p>Application of Protein Hydrolysates: Pure amino acid mixtures (translator's note: amino acids are the final products produced when proteins are digested or broken down, and are thus absorbed by the gastrointestinal tract; their relationship to proteins is like that of glucose to carbohydrates) are difficult to manufacture and expensive, so protein hydrolysates are more suitable. Protein hydrolysates can be manufactured from milk, meat, fish, soybeans, brewer's yeast, or other protein-containing foods. The administration of protein hydrolysates has the following advantages: (1) No digestion is required. (2) Small volume. (3) Can be taken as medicine, unaffected by appetite. (4) There is no conflict with hospital authorities who want to save money on patient diets. Its main disadvantages are: (1) The taste is not good. (2) Large doses can cause diarrhea.</p>
<p>Therapeutic Uses of Protein Hydrolysates</p>
<p>(1) Peptic Ulcers: High-level nutritional therapy for peptic ulcers has already been discussed by Dr. Xue Bangqi in a previous issue of this journal, so it does not need to be repeated in this article.</p>
<p>(2) Malnutrition: Patients with malnutrition can be treated with high-level nutritional therapy to make edema subside within four or five days, and to restore blood protein and red blood cell levels.</p>
<p>(3) Pulmonary Tuberculosis: High-level nutritional therapy can be used in conjunction with other methods of treating pulmonary tuberculosis to accelerate the progress of the condition.</p>
<p>(4) Postoperative Care: Performing surgery, especially surgery on the gastrointestinal tract, followed by high-level nutritional therapy can promote the patient's nutrition and shorten their recovery period.</p>

<p>— Shao</p>
<p>Although folic acid was discovered many years ago, its chemical structure was only recently elucidated, and its artificial synthesis has only now been successfully announced.</p>
<p>Chemically speaking, folic acid is composed of three different chemical groups: pterin, p-aminobenzoic acid, and glutamic acid. Pterin is a yellow pigment found in butterfly wings; folic acid is also a yellow crystal.</p>
<p>Folic acid was originally a component of the vitamin B complex, initially called the "Lactobacillus casei factor" because it is essential for the reproduction of Lactobacillus casei. Recent reports indicate that folic acid is also a necessary element for human hematopoietic function and has special effects on various megaloblastic anemias, no different from liver preparations. Liver preparations are difficult to purify, and their detection requires clinical cases of pernicious anemia, resulting in high prices and inconvenient use. Folic acid is an artificial synthetic product, requiring no bioassay. Future mass production will inevitably lower the price, and the day when it completely replaces liver preparations is not far off.</p>
<p>As early as 1935, Day et al. reported that natural folic acid (initially called vitamin M) was effective in preventing a type of nutritional anemia in white rats. However, the therapeutic effect of this artificial synthetic product on human megaloblastic anemia was not discovered until 1945 by the American vitamin expert Spies et al. They tested several cases of nutritional megaloblastic anemia common in the southern United States and obtained the same therapeutic effect as liver preparations, with a rapid increase in the number of reticulocytes in the blood, followed by a steady rise in the number of red blood cells and the amount of hemoglobin. This year, it was also tested on Sprue, megaloblastic anemia during pregnancy, and true pernicious anemia, all with the same success. These results have been fully confirmed by Darby, Moore, et al., and Zuclzer &amp; Cgden et al. in the same country. Recently, Wilkinson et al. in the United Kingdom used folic acid in five cases of pernicious anemia and obtained similarly satisfactory results.</p>
<p>However, folic acid is not the active ingredient (antianemia factor) in liver preparations, as folic acid is a bright orange-yellow crystal, while the most refined liver extract is colorless. Willmson believes that folic acid may stimulate the production of hematopoietic factors in the body. However, according to the experimental report published by Jacobson &amp; William of the United Kingdom in the October issue of the Journal of Pathology and Bacteriology last year, the antianemia factor in the liver and folic acid may belong to the same class of compounds, and their main chemical group is pterin. According to the research of these two scholars, synthetic xanthopterin and leucopterin, as well as liver extract, can all produce the same reticulocyte reaction in splenectomized rabbits, while other substances such as iron and various vitamins (unfortunately, folic acid was not tested) do not have this effect. Therefore, they believe that the liver antianemia factor may be a pterin derivative.</p>
<h3 id="e191">World Health Organization (Part 2) <a href="#e191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>— Qiao Shumin</p>
<p>1.  A New Definition of Health: The preamble to the constitution of the organization reveals the most progressive and broadest definition of health, considering health to be a state of complete physical, mental, and social well-being, not merely the absence of disease. It also recognizes the highest attainable standard of health as a fundamental right of every human being, without distinction as to race, religion, political belief, economic, or social condition. It further considers governments to have an inescapable responsibility for the protection of the health of their peoples. Readers, consider: What is the view of the meaning of health held by our people? How many people enjoy this basic right? Has the government fulfilled its responsibility to protect the health of the people?</p>
<p>2.  Regarding the Function of Hygiene: They all believe that scientific hygiene is of great help to human peaceful coexistence in this turbulent world. They firmly believe that sanitary facilities will improve the people's standard of living and promote social and economic prosperity, thereby helping to accomplish our common goal - world peace. They all believe that only healthy and well-nourished people can truly understand the true meaning of basic freedom. They also believe that public health is an active and comprehensive crystallization of many scientific principles. In many advanced countries, due to sanitary facilities, the average life expectancy of people has doubled compared to the last century. However, the development situation in various countries is very unbalanced. In some countries, barely half of the children born survive to the age of five, and the average life expectancy of their people is only half that of people in more prosperous countries. They also believe that to achieve the great purpose of the World Health Organization, the greatest effort and sustained effort of our health and acoustic personnel are needed; however, relying solely on our efforts will not be enough; we must mobilize all mankind and enable them to understand the principles of hygiene and strive together. Readers, consider: How many of our people understand the true meaning of basic freedom? What is the average life expectancy of our people? Only heaven knows, perhaps only half of that of the United States and the United Kingdom. To what extent are our health and medical personnel working hard? To what extent have the people been mobilized?</p>
<p>3.  Regarding the Impact of Unhygienic Conditions: They all believe that in the field of hygiene, countries are interdependent and interconnected. An epidemic in any region can endanger other countries. A low standard of health for the people not only hinders the economic prosperity of their own country but also affects the overall prosperity of the world. Readers, consider: What is the impact of the annual prevalence of smallpox, cholera, typhoid fever, dysentery, relapsing fever, [a disease name], black fever, plague, hookworm disease, schistosomiasis, tuberculosis, etc., on our country and the world?</p>
<p>4.  Regarding the Future Mission of the World Health Organization: In the future, all previously established international health organizations will be merged into this new World Health Organization. It will use all the latest scientific knowledge and equipment to defeat the god of disease and plague, so disease prevention is still the primary goal. But this is only the first step. It must be known how many people in the world are struggling below the hunger line! Therefore, using our nutritional knowledge to cooperate with efforts in agricultural and food production to achieve freedom from hunger is also one of the goals. The second step is to positively promote physical and mental health in a balanced way, in order to achieve a higher level of physical development, a longer life span, more effective production capacity, and a more meaningful life.</p>
<p>However, if human beings cannot live in peace and there is another major war, everything will be destroyed, and hygiene will be in vain. We should know that science can be used for good or evil. The key lies not in the scientists themselves, but in the awareness and conscience of the broad masses of people to determine the good or bad fortune and life and death of human destiny. From the standpoint of striving for world peace, the World Health Organization does not seem to be a rallying point for uniting people all over the world, a friendship response for people of different cultures and different beliefs, and may become a hot stone for world peace organizations. I can't help but gather incense to wish it well!</p>
<h3 id="e192">Diagnosis of Peptic Ulcers with X-rays <a href="#e192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Youxin</p>
<p>There are two significant differences between X-ray examinations of the stomach and X-ray examinations of the lungs. The first point is the difference in tissues. The lungs can naturally show their contours under X-rays without relying on another medium; this natural manifestation is not possible for the stomach, so a special medicine is usually needed to fill its interior before it can be examined. This medicine is either pure barium sulfate or barium sulfate synthesized with other unimportant ingredients. Taking this medicine alone has some limewater-like appearance and some soil-like taste. This medicine is very good. It does not cause any chemical reactions in the gastrointestinal tract, does not hinder the work of the gastrointestinal tract, does not cause any side effects, and is not poisonous, but it can help with the examination. The second difference is that the work of the stomach is intermittent, while the work of the lungs is continuous. Thus, the examination of the stomach needs a starting point and an ending point. The examination starts when the stomach is empty, and the ending point is when there is no residue of barium in the stomach. The examination between these two points can be adjusted according to the actual situation. From this point of view, the examination of the stomach is more complicated compared to the examination of the lungs.</p>
<p>The method of examining the stomach emphasizes both fluoroscopy and radiography. In terms of the diagnostic value itself, fluoroscopy is more important than radiography. During fluoroscopy, the position of the stomach can be changed freely, any part can be palpated, any suspicious place can be observed in detail, the location of tenderness can be determined, the softness or stiffness of the gastric wall, adhesion or prominence, or the hyperfunction or decline of gastric function, the freedom or discontinuity of peristalsis, and the muscle contraction or relaxation of the pyloric or any part can all be accurately conceptualized. Of course, the imprint of the pathogen itself can also be revealed on the fluoroscopy screen at the same time. However, radiography also has special functions. It is not only a record of the shadow for future reference or a blueprint for consultation, but it can also provide information that is omitted during fluoroscopy or is not clearly displayed.</p>
<p>If the above methods cannot be summarized into an accurate diagnosis, then there are several special examination methods that can be used. Now, let's skip over them briefly. There is also a situation where the stomach's symptoms occur as a result of diseases affecting other parts or systems. To give an example, many of the so-called indigestion or stomach pain are caused by diseases of the appendix. There are also so-called true stomach wall erosions that are caused by brain problems. However, even with diseases of the stomach itself, an X-ray examination cannot always lead to a definitive conclusion. However, most failures are mostly due to the mildness of the disease and the short duration of the illness. There are also cases where the main symptoms of the disease are buried during the X-ray examination due to the presence of many secondary signs. Therefore, in many cases, the results of X-ray examinations can only be considered as a clinical reference, like other laboratory methods, and cannot be considered as a diagnosis. However, if the result is very clear, or the examiner is very experienced and confident, it is equivalent to a perfect, independent diagnosis.</p>
<p>Some people also doubt whether the amount of X-rays received during a stomach examination will be harmful to the body. This answer can be negated based on modern knowledge. The amount of X-rays that can cause at least a minimal biological change is difficult to exceed in a careful stomach examination, which means that this consideration is superfluous under normal circumstances.</p>
<p>Now, let's talk about why patients with peptic ulcers need an X-ray examination. The first thing to do is to check if an ulcer exists. If it is confirmed, then its location, size, depth, and number all need to be clarified. Secondly, it is necessary to determine its connection with gastric function, digestive obstacles, gastric emptying obstruction, gastric wall adhesion, or anything else. The second thing is to distinguish whether this ulcer belongs to the ordinary type or the so-called malignant type. The third is about the selection of treatment methods. Even during the treatment of ulcers, X-ray follow-up is also necessary. Determining whether the treatment is effective or not, this follow-up is very helpful. Furthermore, after surgery, the stomach examination can not only provide a strong reference in clinical methods, but also allow for timely preventive measures to prevent ulcer recurrence.</p>
<p>Regarding the X-ray signs of ulcers, the most definitive value is the "niche" sign. The "niche" shadow is a diseased organ with a small protruding area on its contour. This is the shadow caused by the ulcer itself being filled with the medicine consumed. The position of this "niche" is mostly located on the upper edge of the stomach or at the tip of the duodenum directly connected to the stomach, and occasionally on the pylorus or lower end of the esophagus. Although stomach ulcers themselves are much less numerous than duodenal ulcers, the "niche" itself is easier to find in the stomach. However, not every ulcer patient can easily show this important sign, so sometimes it is necessary to rely on other signs to confirm the diagnosis. This will be omitted for now.</p>
<p>Now, let's talk about when a stomach examination cannot be performed. Sometimes, a stomach examination is inappropriate or should be delayed. For example, after stomach bleeding, the palpation during the examination may cause re-bleeding. There are also times when the ulcer is about to perforate, then the procedure during the examination may also cause adverse consequences.</p>

<h3 id="e193">Yangtze River Journey <a href="#e193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>— Gan Xiao</p>
<p>The twentieth century should be the era of "man conquering nature," yet in many, many places in our daily lives, we are always "calling to heaven when in extreme distress."</p>
<p>This time, I came from Hankou, traveling from river to river. It was originally a very smooth waterway, but I called to heaven several times. And after arriving home safely, I still felt like an old village woman, feeling "blessed by heaven."</p>
<p>Buying a boat ticket with money is the simplest thing, but I still called to heaven. On the day I arrived in Hankou, several ships were docked on the shore, having already disgorged their cargo and passengers. However, the larger ones belonged to the state-owned China Merchants Steam Navigation Company and had been designated as "official ships." The smaller ones were ships of private companies, and the official ticket sales time lasted only a few fleeting minutes, forcing people to resort to the black market. A friend who worked at the shipping company listed a bunch of unsafe aspects of black market tickets, which made me, a law-abiding citizen, cautiously retreat. "An honest person does not do shady things." I followed my friend's advice and waited for a "fair market" ticket to become available. As a result, I waited and waited, and the rats and bedbugs in the warehouse launched a brazen attack. I was so anxious that my hair turned white. I firmly advocated giving in to the "black market." Only then did I buy a third-class ticket for the "fixed class" (cabin with berths) at one and a half times the price. First and second-class tickets were naturally lost to the black market.</p>
<p>The ship I was on was not considered young: fifty-three years old! Stepping onto the deck, my feet felt sticky, indicating that it had been seasoned by smoke and grime, not fresh, white, and tender. It was said to be about five hundred tons, and it was loaded with three or four hundred tons of cargo and four or five hundred passengers in Hankou. Most of the passengers were demobilized military and government personnel, embracing boxes, luggage, and sundries. The ship was quite full. There were not many first and second-class passengers. Most of them were third-class "fixed class" and fourth-class "free class." How can these two groups of people be crammed into this fish gut without making people call to heaven!</p>
<p>The "fixed class" berths were divided into upper and lower layers. Mine was on the lower layer. I opened my bedding package and made the bed sideways, and placed a few small pieces of luggage at my feet. In order to reduce crowding, I took off my leather shoes and crawled into bed. Then, bursts of noise came, mainly because the luggage of other passengers was too much, and the steward was trying his best to stop them. What is the use of the stewards? They do not have grass green uniforms and collar badges. Thus, the "fixed class" became a disguised luggage room. The air vents and the south passage were all blocked by luggage. And the most wonderful thing was my "head-over" people: there were a total of eleven of them, but they only bought four upper berths; two berths were prepared for people to sit on; two berths were prepared to put the twenty-five or six pieces of luggage! When they put down six bayonet-mounted rifles, the stewards shut their mouths and stood far away, and the luggage and sundries were moved in one by one. Lying on my back, I could see very clearly: the luggage berth was gradually tilting, and the only horizontal support was gradually bending. I knew that the two female passengers sleeping in the lower berth were in imminent danger. I could not help but stand up and protest. I said:</p>
<p>"This is not a luggage room. If everyone puts their luggage in like this, the air will be completely squeezed out. And putting these luggage on this thin board, the upper berth will collapse and kill people. Who is responsible"?</p>
<p>Hey! Their leader stood up proudly and patted his chest: "I am responsible, I am the brigade commander"! He pointed to the shoulder badge of his major general rank. Oh! Brigade Commander! I thought to myself: "Did the brigade commander fall from the sky? What does he care if people are killed or not"? While thinking this, the horizontal support really broke. If the female passengers' berths below had not also had trunks, they two would have had to test the brigade commander's "responsibility." I don't know why, but I heavily tapped the brigade commander's shoulder, without saying a word, just pressing the flashlight to show him the broken horizontal support. At this time, his arrogance was slightly lower, and he directed his soldiers: "Move the luggage down! People are going to die"! So all of his luggage was stuffed into the passage, and the four berths only slept eleven people. We "lower class" were spared the catastrophe of being crushed to death, and had to thank heaven and earth!</p>
<p>The next morning, I went to the women's restroom: walking along the stern to the kitchen, walking down the steps from the kitchen, passing through the berths of the free class, and turning right. Opening that short door, the situation inside was unbearable to see: it was obviously overflowing with excrement; there was no place to stand. Heavens! The "black slave ships" on the Atlantic in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries must have looked like this?</p>
<p>Climbing up the handrail, a pile of people squatted blocking the way. Looking down, they were all holding rice on the floor with both hands. A bowl of rice was overturned, and the white rice was mixed with the black paste that stained the bottom of the feet, looking like pig lard and sesame rice ball filling. Heavens! This is what they prepared for the third and fourth class passengers!</p>
<p>I wanted to turn to the deck to get some air, but this ship had no deck at all. At a glance, it was all firewood boards like mountains! The friends in the "free class" were all learning Goujian's lying on firewood, taking the firewood boards as beds. In addition to the firewood boards, there were eggs, duck eggs, salted fish, and cured meat, I don't know how many dozens or hundreds of baskets. I asked an old steward and learned that these were the private goods of the ship's purser and stewards. I asked him why so much private goods could be brought? He frowned and smiled bitterly and said: "What else can we do if we don't bring them? There are a total of thirty-five stewards. Not one of us gets paid a lot of money. The ship only provides a bowl of white rice. Everyone has children and wives at home. Most of the passengers are now soldiers, and we can't get tips. What else can we do if we don't bring private goods? Now we are hiding it from the superiors but not from the subordinates. Except for the big boss of the company, the pursers on the ship are all in the same boat. The pursers get paid, and they can also sell berths on the ship; but the private goods they bring are even more than ours." I can't estimate how much weight their private goods have, but when I stretched my head and looked down, the calm river water was almost level with the ship's side. If there was a slight wave, it could hit the porthole. This old small ship was really in danger.</p>
<p>The teacher taught people "not to stand under a dangerous wall." We are now loaded onto a dangerous ship. Looking around, the river is vast. What other way to feel at ease other than calling to heaven in secret?</p>
<p>After passing Datong, the anchor was suddenly dropped in the middle of the night, and everyone asked the steward one after another. The old steward explained: "There is fog! The fog is falling from the sky. The ship's salary is low; the pilot is an inexperienced novice, which is called the blind man not disliking the cripple, and the cripple not disliking the blind man, so we just put up with each other. At this time, it is good to be careful and stop." Heavens, dropping anchor is a good thing! Otherwise, we would have to sacrifice ourselves to their "blindness" and "cripple"!</p>
<p>Approaching Jiangyin, the anchor was dropped again. Impatient passengers all jumped up, and the old steward came to explain again: "Passengers, you are anxious, but our pilot is even more anxious than you. He has a happy event at home tomorrow night. There is no way! The ship is about to reach 'Anchor Sand.' It's dark, and the fog is heavy. How can we go? We still have to be careful about foreign ships. They also say that our ship is an 'old man ship'! Several passengers asked him: 'What is "Anchor Sand"?' 'Anchor Sand'? 'Anchor Sand' is strange! It is an evil spirit! At midnight, it will close in. The ship will run aground, and when it is light, the sand will sink, and the ship will be sucked down. In the past, a French ship ran aground in Dao place, thinking it didn't matter, but it was sucked away by the monster when it was light. Only when the Japanese are here, the monster is also afraid of them and never appears'." Is the monster really afraid of the Japanese? I think there are just more lighthouses!</p>
<p>The anchor was dropped for two hours, and the engine wheezed and started again. The fog deepened layer by layer, and the riverbank was hidden without a trace. The whistle honked a long sound every two minutes. The long sound was like the wail of a dying beast, which made people's hearts mess up! The old steward was complaining like a soliloquy: "Looking for death! To sail in such fog! If we can get through, the pilot can be a bridegroom, but if we can't get through, five hundred people will go to see the King of Hell together"! In the dark night, the half-bright oil lamp swayed, and the reclining passengers looked like corpses. The steward's complaints and the wailing whistle symphonized, making people feel hairy and creepy, as if the King of Hell was beckoning.</p>
<p>Finally, it was dawn, and the sun had the momentum to break through the clouds and dispel the fog. Although the riverbank was still invisible, the whistle was called less and less frequently. After a few more hours, we were finally sent to the Huangpu River bank. When we stepped onto the shore, the renewed rejoicing was like ascending to heaven.</p>
<p>It is so dark on the river. In the twentieth century, traveling on the river still relies on heaven. Who wants to be born at this time and in this place?</p>

<p>— Bao Dixili</p>
<p>Botticelli (Sandro Botticelli I44E-1510) can be regarded as an outstanding talent with a great imagination in the Florentine school. Although he has also painted several Madonna and Child pictures, he is a bold anti-Christian. Representative works include "Ode to Spring", "The Birth of Venus", etc. The composition is special and ingenious, the color is fresh and the lines are beautiful, and the subject matter belongs to fantasy, but the faces depicted are full of love and desire, and have a "modern" feeling. The "Fruits" original manuscript is one of them. (Lion)</p>

<p>— Liu Sui</p>
<p>It is the time when dreams return.</p>
<p>The cold wind outside the window howls.</p>
<p>The clamorous noises cease, and the memories by my pillow turn toward a sorrowful life. A faint sense of melancholy fills my heart.</p>
<p>I seem to hear your faint laughter:</p>
<p>"Your life's journey is gradually turning dim and shrinking!"</p>
<p>Yes, it's been a year, exactly today, the day when people at the Qiantang Riverhead were immersed in rare revelry. The warmth of peace and light lifted our curtains, and we slowly walked through that long and tranquil lake embankment, as if passing through a period of suffering that had already left us behind. Deep in the willow grove, there was the glow of lamplight, and I saw an excited and joyous rise and fall in your chest:</p>
<p>"From now on, you should stagger forward vividly and stubbornly toward the journey you are aiming for!"</p>
<p>"Quietly now!" My lips pressed against your warm hairline: "I am thinking about those splendid and extravagant steps ahead!"</p>
<p>A melodious song came from a corner of the small building, the lake water was still tranquil, and the night mist drifted across our cheeks; we smiled at each other.</p>
<p>Can you say that was a distant dream?</p>
<p>In the third month of spring, this year, I came to this city with you.</p>
<p>I heard people praising this newborn city with blessings.</p>
<p>But I saw a lot:</p>
<p>Those who come from the distant north, besides still retaining some warm memories of the fireside in the snowy sky, haven't they all learned to coax warm vows at the edge of the brightly lit curtains?</p>
<p>And those who have crept into this city from the south, the longing and lingering for the blue sea and sky have faded. In many eye-catching corners, aren't they also composing melodies that make people feel bewildered with the joyful sounds of their hearts?</p>
<p>Who understands lament? Who understands anger? Aren't everyone hastily and confusedly creating things that mock our lives with their own hands?</p>
<p>I helplessly run through every corner of this city again and again. The accusations of the kind are being suffocated to the point of extinction! Everywhere there is harm to society! Oppression of humanity!</p>
<p>There is no story, no poetry, just a page of pitiful blankness!</p>
<p>It was originally a bottomless torrent of murky water!</p>
<p>I gradually forgot singing aloud and shouting wildly, and I slowly learned the worldliness and pretense of life; I accepted the praise and indulgence of the social system, and I also tasted the melancholy and sorrow of the human world. I have become a piece of dross floating in the murky current. Dross will never, and cannot, cause ripples to rise in the murky current!</p>
<p>The vivid and stubborn journey is no longer intimate, and a shameful emptiness remains in my heart.</p>
<p>The disappointment this brings to you is inevitable.</p>
<p>But I am already tired enough.</p>
<p>Yes, it's been a year, exactly today. The people in this city have not withered away the usual revelry, desolate songs are still overflowing, and emerald cypress branches and ivy reflect the flames in the candlelight. All of this deeply evokes my memories.</p>
<p>Let me wash away the idleness and waste of this year with repentance! Even if this city inflicts cruelty and bitterness upon me, there is still next year, there is still a precious period of time... I still have a soul that has not been infected by vulgarity and decline!</p>
<p>I silently meditate by my pillow, facing the candle. You should be able to imagine my mood at this moment.</p>
<p>The clamorous mortal world will return again, won't it? The cold wind outside the window howls.</p>
<p>You should bless it, the future rebirth of this city!</p>
<p>It is the time when dreams return.</p>
<p>The eve of the winter solstice, year thirty-five.</p>

<p>— Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>"Oh!" For the first time, He Jian felt real terror. "Then, where did these numbers come from?"</p>
<p>"That was probably a year ago?"</p>
<p>"What?" He Jian thought he had misheard.</p>
<p>"You know we also have a set of machines. A year ago, we often received this kind of special code, but we didn't pay much attention. Recently, after hearing more about it, Teacher Qingmu spent some effort to solve the numbers... But you don't need to worry, so far, only he alone can decipher it, but it still takes a lot of effort. He doesn't want to publish it, and he doesn't want to do more. He says he still wants to live."</p>
<p>"Ah," He Jian felt a load lift off his shoulders when he heard this. "Pingzi, I have another word. What I'm doing is so difficult, and since the old man said someone else is doing it, this is a good deed to save countless lives. Why doesn't the old man..."</p>
<p>"Why doesn't he try to find that thing?" Pingzi finished He Jian's sentence for him. "It's not that he doesn't want to find it, it's just that he can't find the location where it's hidden."</p>
<p>"Why doesn't he use mysticism?"</p>
<p>"Brother, you say you've also studied mysticism, how can you say such amateurish things?"</p>
<p>"Surely you can perform a technique on the person hiding it?"</p>
<p>"There's no medium."</p>
<p>"Aren't you a ready-made medium?"</p>
<p>"I have no emotional connection with that old fellow, how can I be a medium?" Pingzi was a little angry.</p>
<p>"Alas!" He Jian was disappointed. "Then, goodbye!"</p>
<p>"Goodbye, Brother, definitely goodbye, at least three times; the last goodbye, I heard it's for a very long time!" Pingzi hung up the phone with a chuckle.</p>
<p>He Jian was preoccupied and didn't pay much attention to the meaning of Pingzi's "long time," nor did he want to nag her any further. As for the evening's plan, although it had been disturbed by this phone call, everyone felt that things had reached this stage, and it was like an arrow on the string, which had to be released; moreover, they were somewhat doubtful about Pingzi's words.</p>
<p>At exactly nine o'clock in the evening, He Jian was sitting upright in the military aircraft "Chang Sheng." There were seven or eight people traveling with him, all of whom were active-duty senior officers going to North China, except for He Jian. However, half an hour before the plane took off, the second supplement of Tokyo's evening newspapers, in addition to the frontline news, published a mysterious short message entitled "Challenge to He Jian Wang by a Mysterious Opponent," which read: "To He Jian Yujun: I have long admired your excellent skills as a man. Now you encounter a favorable opportunity: the Prime Minister also favors you with a strange eye; a meteoric rise is just around the corner. However, although my colleagues are humble, we do not dare to act on behalf of others. We dare to make suggestions and presumptuously demand a slight price; a sword, a gentle rain, we ask for one or two hands, that is enough. Around 11 pm, 'Beppu' sincerely awaits. With respect, the Silk Field Society."</p>
<p>That day, the evening newspapers all treated this matter as fresh news. After publishing this mysterious short message, the chief editors of each newspaper also attached a few thoughts: some said, "Why are you fighting among yourselves?" Others said, "The style of the knights of the Edo fifteenth century is seen again today!" Still others said something like "A chivalrous thief challenging Holmes, there will be a good show to watch!" There were also those who said, "Soldiers should serve the country loyally, and should do their best, not seek credit. Why be jealous? If you feel indignant, you should be upright and stand up and have a contest in front of the public, and it is better to be upright than to use sneaky tricks."</p>
<p>On the side of the plane, five or six of the eight passengers bought several copies of the second supplement; although the newspapers were different, they happened to publish this short message, and explained that He Jian was riding on this "Wei Sheng." Although the seven people did not know He Jian, they could of course guess; because they were a group, and He Jian was alone.</p>
<h3 id="e197">Homecoming Poetry Notes <a href="#e197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>— Pin Baihua</p>
<p>Awakening Wang Wei, unable to paint it,</p>
<p>I can be proud that my birthplace has "famous mountains." China is a country with many mountains, but only mountains that are clear and beautiful can be called famous. Thus, the line of the immortal Li Taibai of over a thousand years, "loving famous mountains, entering Yue," is not distorted; and at the same time, he also dreamed of traveling to Mount Tianmu, the so-called place of the immortal's dream of "eighteen thousand feet," which is east of my hometown. But things often have the opposite result. For the famous mountains of my birthplace, for more than ten years, the feeling of regret has overshadowed the element of imitation, because I have long become a "person of east, west, north, and south," without the good fortune of "riding a slow horse and a low carriage to be a good person in my hometown."</p>
<p>However, I have finally returned. After passing "Qingfeng Ridge," the Yue Creek is like a flat practice, circling around the steep peaks. White clouds are the outer garment of the mountain spirit, aren't they? It drifts so freely past one mountain peak after another. The verdant trees reflect a few white board houses, telling me that there is a natural embrace inside, not stained with the machinations of the city. I think this not only attracts the poetic sentiment of immortals, but also makes for a very good painting, but it is too natural. Unless Wang Mojie, who has "poetry in painting," comes to paint a "Map of Yue," wouldn't it be better than the "Axial River Map" with "mountain valleys with rolling cloud momentum flying"?</p>
<p>The small chartered car stopped in Sheng County. I know Zongen took advantage of the remaining time to transfer cars to take a look at "Ting Yin Pavilion," but it's just a mound of earth covered with weeds. How many people in such a place can learn from Dai Andao to "carry double citrus and a bucket of wine"! Naturally, it's late autumn, where can you find yellow orioles? Just circling around the grass industry, we got on the bus to Xinchang. Shengxin is only forty miles away, and the carriage is full of local accents, but I, who have been away for more than ten years, have even changed my local accent, not to mention my temples. Especially in a cloth coat, who would recognize you? So I crouched down, afraid to hear the local accent. Gradually, the ancient mountain city of my hometown came into view. I pulled Zongen out of the car, choosing the remote road at the foot of the city, not wanting the "elders of Jiangdong" to discover this poor boy returning to his hometown looking the same as ever.</p>
<p>It was night, and there were no electric lights in my hometown. I remember that in the past, there was this gift of the city, but probably "restoration" is not easy! In this way, once night falls, the whole place is pitch black. In addition, 70% to 80% of the streets and houses were destroyed in the robbery fire, a scene of ruins. Although I brought a "lantern," it was still difficult to find the path. My three old houses have changed into "authentic" roof eaves, and there is nothing inside. I temporarily stayed in the empty room of the Senate.</p>
<p>For several days in a row, thanks to Zongen's light, eating was not a problem, because there were people inviting us to dinner every morning and evening. However, I hate that the invitations actually follow the words "Chen Inspector" with "Professor Lu." The mountain city is huge, and the number of civil servants is at most three or four thousand yuan a month, and the county magistrate is only 100,000. The show and entertainment are actually very urbanized.</p>
<p>Thousands of cliffs plunge, jade bathing the collar,</p>
<p>Awakening Wang Wei, unable to complete it;</p>
<p>Coming home in Confucian robes, no one recognizes me,</p>
<p>The rear car is afraid to hear the sounds of home!</p>
<p>After ten years of desolation, looking for three paths,</p>
<p>Wood and stone are heartless, easily change masters;</p>
<p>Wanting to worship the Dragon Mound, I have become an unfilial son,</p>
<p>Stone pass trees are planted and transformed.</p>
<p>A Brief History of Musicians</p>

<p>Handel, a great German musician, is as famous as Bach, another great musician in that country. The difference between the two is expressed in: Bach lived a secluded life, fully engaged in church music works, the mood in the quiet includes severity; Handel was famous throughout Europe, wrote opera works, the writing is flying and smooth. However, Handel's efforts were not in Germany, but in England, and his more important works are allowed in "Faqu". Otatorrum, the so-called "Note Song", is similar in nature to opera, but it does not appear on stage, it sings and plays itself. Handel was born in 1683 and died in 1759.</p>
<h3 id="e199">Bach <a href="#e199" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c199" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">199</a></h3>
<p>Bach (Bach), a German, is the ancestor of modern Western music, and is as famous as Handel. Most of his works are church music, but they are often played in music. He wrote a lot throughout his life. He was born in 1685 and died in 1750.</p>

<h3 id="e200">Accident <a href="#e200" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c200" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">200</a></h3>
<p>— Shaofu</p>
<p>On Christmas Day, three pairs of planes crashed in Shanghai one after another, killing and injuring more than seventy people. It is a great misfortune that this tragedy happened on this festive day!</p>
<p>The cause of the accident was due to heavy fog, and the plane could not identify the airport, resulting in disaster. After inspecting the wreckage of the crashed aircraft, there were no signs of fire burning, which is enough to prove that each aircraft had been circling in Shanghai for a long time, the oil had been burned out, and forced landing was the only option. On this day, only one aircraft, No. 147 of the Chinese Company, was unexpectedly lucky enough to make a forced landing at Jiangwan Airport, suffering slight damage, and the personnel on board were miraculously unharmed.</p>
<p>Fatalists may exaggerate and say: life and death have a number. In fact, although this misfortune is said to be unpredictable weather (heavy fog), and attributed to changes in the climate, it can still be avoided by doing one's best. We remember that when the Chinese Flying Clipper was test-flying the Pacific route, it encountered a storm in the Pacific Ocean. If it were not for perfect flight equipment, it would not have been able to complete this flight smoothly. Heavy fog is certainly a major obstacle to flight, but if radio guidance is used, and if the ground landing guidance equipment (using light or sound) is perfect, how can heavy fog affect safety?</p>
<p>The record of flight accidents this year is really not small. Over time, it is inevitable that the general public will become wary of air travel. Should airline companies and traffic authorities carefully study it, and assess all equipment and various responsible personnel (including drivers, telecommunications and ground personnel), so as to prevent problems before they occur? Because human life is a matter of life and death, it is absolutely impossible to be negligent. Seeking perfection is not only providing passengers with security, but also making a great contribution to the future of China's aviation industry.</p>
<h3 id="e201">Year-End Musings <a href="#e201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>— Cishou</p>
<p>"Rising wind", "storming wind", "robbing wind", "falling wind", "When the strong wind rises, the people suffer!"</p>
<p>The thirty-fifth year of the Republic of China is about to pass. Before we welcome the arrival of the thirty-sixth year, we might as well review this year. I think about it and can't come up with a good term to give to this year, so let's give it a "nickname" and call this year the "Year of Many Winds."</p>
<p>Although the weather has been cold recently, there are not many winds outside. Why call it "Year of Many Winds"? Could it be that I am stirring up trouble? That's right, the meaning of wind is very broad; the wind I am talking about is neither the southeast wind nor the northwest wind, but this year's "rising wind", "storming wind", "robbing wind", and "falling wind."</p>
<p>First, "rising wind." Whenever a rising wind strikes, people are like they are in a daze, at a loss. After the rising wind has passed, they wake up and take a breath. But good times don't last long, and the second rising wind intensifies and follows, making people re-enter a dazed state. The common people spend their days in this endless cycle of rising winds, and I really don't know when prices will stop rising?</p>
<p>Then there is "storming wind." Whether you are in a theater or on a court, you can see this wind, and someone is directing it endlessly. I don't know why human nature has become so irritable. A disagreement leads to a fight, beating people until they are battered and bleeding. It's all "like it's nothing," happy to be watched by others.</p>
<p>The third is "robbing wind." This year, life is difficult to solve, and there are not a few people who take risks, and the robbing wind is becoming more and more intense. But there are different tricks to robbing. "Robbers and bandits" are robbing in the open, and corrupt officials and unscrupulous merchants are robbing in secret. Those who rob in the open say that they are robbing because life is difficult to solve, but what are those who rob in secret robbing for? Robbing gold, robbing US dollars, robbing supplies, robbing happily. No matter how you rob, in short, hoarding private goods will not "inflate" like currency. The more you rob, the more you use, cause and effect, robbing without end!</p>
<p>Finally, "falling wind." This seems to be the "壓台戲" (last act of a performance). As the end of the year approaches, falling wind is prevalent.</p>
<h3 id="e202">Liu Jianxu, Chairman of Fujian <a href="#e202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>— Ganlai</p>
<p>The current Chairman of Fujian Province, Liu Jianxu, graduated from the third class of the Baoding Military Academy in the artillery branch. After leaving the school, he served in various military positions, rising from platoon leader to commander-in-chief of the army group and deputy commander of the Third War Zone. After the seventeenth year of the Republic of China, he was responsible for the pacification work on the border of Hunan and Jiangxi, and achieved the effect of destroying the bandits, which was highly praised by the superiors. During the Anti-Japanese War, he traveled to the southeast battlefield. In the Battle of Hangzhou Bay, he captured Zhenhai, and the situation in Zhejiang Province was turned from danger to safety. Later, as Chen Yi became Chairman of Fujian Province, the lost land along the coast was recovered one after another. He always adhered to the principle of "three points military, seven points politics" in his administration, and the gradual stabilization of the situation in Fujian shows that his administration has indeed achieved some results.</p>
<p>In mid-March of this year, Liu visited Shanghai and hosted a banquet for Fujian fellow villagers in Shanghai at the Jinmen Hotel. He himself is from Liling, Hunan, with a fat, round face, which makes him look particularly energetic.</p>
<p>Liu's original wife, Chen, has thirteen daughters and five sons, making a total of ten children in the family.</p>
<p>He is very strict in managing his family, does not allow his family to wear strange clothes, and hates gambling, and uses this as a precept to teach his daughters.</p>
<p>Since the twenty-fifth year of Fujian, the people have suffered from natural disasters, man-made disasters and corruption and exploitation. Now they need to rest and recover. The people all hope that Chairman Liu will work hard to govern and stabilize people's livelihood!</p>
<h3 id="e203">In the midst of war, there is a paradise <a href="#e203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>The housing shortage that came with the victory has not been solved until now. The authorities seem to have put some thought into it, and the plan is one after another, residential areas, civilian villages, these are always just talk on paper.</p>
<p>Recently, I "Columbus" discovered a truly genuine "civilian village." Where is it? The location is in the "West Station" and "Xin Longhua" area. The residents here, as in "Peach Blossom Spring," are uncontested, working at sunrise and resting at sunset.</p>
<p>This place was originally wasteland, but now, shop owners complain, factory owners sigh poor, all say that the end of the year is difficult, and there is another hurdle after one is passed. These days, they have a feeling of "living like years," every day like "New Year's Eve." I think, if we don't fundamentally think about peace and stability, no matter what wise method you come up with, you can't resist this falling wind.</p>
<p>I don't know what wind will come after the falling wind. In short, this year is the "Year of Many Winds." To be honest, we common people do not miss this kind of year; our only hope is that next year can be "good weather and peace and prosperity for the country," and no longer make us common people suffer!</p>
<p>It has already become an emerging "civilian village." The newly built houses, although not three-dimensional red-tiled brick, are very neat and orderly, and each household has its own separate house, living very freely and comfortably, with bedrooms, kitchens, living rooms. In the open space outside the door, they plant beans, wheat, vegetables, and scallions. Although there is no tap water, it is not a problem to dig a pond for drinking, and each household raises some chickens, ducks, pigs, and sheep. Therefore, the New Year's dishes may not be as rich as those of the salaried people in Shanghai.</p>
<p>According to reports, the houses here do not need to "gold bars" to secure. They are all built by the people of northern Jiangsu themselves, and the materials needed for construction are moved from rubble yards elsewhere. Lao Mao said that he lives so comfortably without spending a penny, and he doesn't need the dangerous mouth of a second landlord, and he doesn't need to pay rent. "Donations and taxes" are unrelated to them. Although the landlord has negotiated with them, these people from northern Jiangsu really have nowhere to live. As the saying goes, only this house can keep people living, there is no tearing down the house to drive people away, and besides, everyone has a heart of compassion!</p>
<p>In this emerging "civilian village," there are also several village stores, tobacco paper shops, small teahouses, barbershops, and snack stalls. The sparrow is small, but it has all the organs.</p>
<p>From here, I see the spirit of self-reliance of the people of northern Jiangsu. The people of northern Jiangsu are all able to endure hardship and are not dependent. They can live "without asking anyone" everywhere. The children already know how to "scavenge" and sell tea and can eat and drink without relying on their parents, so I think the people of northern Jiangsu are worthy of emulation.</p>

<p>— Galing</p>
<p>A tax collector made a grand speech to many people: "The government and the people are like father and son. Protecting children from being bullied by enemies, educating them, and taking care of them all require money, so it is right and proper for the people to pay taxes enthusiastically, the more the better!"</p>
<p>One of them listened and said, "I understand, it's like this.</p>
<p>"I keep a puppy. It's hungry and wags its tail at me for food. I say to it, 'Dear puppy, you must be very hungry, right? I'm really sorry, let me help you.'"</p>
<p>"I found a knife, cut off its little tail, and then put it in its mouth: 'Eat! My faithful good dog! Eat this piece of meat to nourish your body!'"</p>
<p>The tax collector stopped talking.</p>

<p>— Hu Yisheng</p>
<p>In China, there is only "democracy," not republic. This democracy lacking a republic is just "I am the only one who is respected," "I am here." "I" is the most beautiful "note" in the world.</p>
<p>Originally, the trend of the world has generally turned from individualism to collectivism, but our country is still seeking a way out in the "democracy" of individualism. What can we find? Adding a lot of "democratic gimmicks" and new bureaucrats who eat "democratic" meals, what help is there for China? Wu Zhi Lao said that to achieve world harmony, we must go through thirty-six small wars and seventy-two major wars. If this "democracy" continues, even after seventy-two small wars and one hundred and forty-four major wars, "small harmony" will not come!</p>
<p>I think the way out for China is not in democracy but in the republic, or at least we must say: "The republic is more important than democracy."</p>

<p>Street Performance and Begging (Middle)</p>
<p>(6) "The Genuine and Fake Dumbs" -- Dumbness is a type of disability, and beggars also utilize it as a magic weapon for eliciting sympathy. However, there are genuine and fake versions, and the profession is divided into four types. They are called "Deceiving Heaven", "Shouting Mouth", "Blocking the Road", and "Acting Real". "Deceiving Heaven" refers to genuinely and truly dumb individuals, while "Shouting Mouth" are those who have learned the act. Originally, pretending to be dumb is the easiest trick, and the beggars are divided into "Blocking the Road" and "Walking the Streets" factions. They go their separate ways and do not interfere with each other. "Blocking the Road" involves kneeling by the roadside, knocking their heads on the ground, muttering words, pointing to heaven and earth, then pointing to their own mouths and hearts, patting their chests to beg. "Walking the Streets" involves begging from door to door. When the fake dumbs gather to beg, they are not allowed to chat, according to the rules. They are only allowed to speak after returning to "Yuxiang Hall" (beggar factory).</p>
<p>(7) "Nose Guanyin" -- This group must wear straw shoes and straw circles on their heads. "Double Dragons Entering the Sea" involves using bamboo to carve two long Yingzi, with velvet balls hanging at the ends. When begging, they insert the bamboo into their nostrils, exposing the velvet balls outside. "Genuine Dragon Mouth" refers to snake charming through the nose. Both factions are "speaking with one nostril."</p>
<p>(8) "Sitting on the Floor" -- Sitting on the side of the road and singing wildly. The lyrics say: "Good feet, good hands, the road to heaven; bad feet, bad hands, the gate to hell. Out in the open, coming in the dark, not a penny falls on empty ground." The singing is filled with rising and falling cadence, causing people to feel pity.</p>
<p>(9) "Selling Ear Picks" -- Selling bamboo ear picks along the street is another branch of the beggar gang. The gang refers to themselves as "Holding Gauze Hats," the meaning of which is unknown. However, those who work in this profession are unwilling to admit that they are beggars. Most likely because the income is not bad, they have already joined the ranks of small vendors. It is said that being able to hold a gauze hat in the right hand and independently operate a knife to manufacture ear picks with the left hand is considered a signature skill.</p>
<p>(10) "The Bitter Flesh Knife" -- This gang is divided into "Waist Block" and "Enclosure" types. When the waist block beggar goes on the street, he must first put on his upper body clothing, and carry a two-foot-long ring-handled knife. When he is not given money, he hits his waist hard with the knife, creating new red marks. This makes shopkeepers both surprised and pitiful, so they give money to end the matter. "Enclosure" is similar to street performers, setting up a venue in a vacant area by the roadside and begging from people. However, these people do not have the good skills of the Jianghu gang, they just bang and knock in a chaotic way, deceiving idlers and others.</p>
<p>(11) "Dancing with Sticks" -- Similar to the above item, belonging to the street performance category, but despised by the Jianghu gang. One type is called "Qishu," who can dance wooden sticks in a variety of ways. The other is called "Hitting Sticks," who use three short sticks, one thick and two thin, dancing along the street and begging.</p>
<p>(12) "The Genuine and Fake Blinds" -- There are genuine and fake dumbs, and naturally there are genuine and fake blinds. Moreover, there are more fake blinds than genuine ones. Imposters are called "Cold Look" in the gang, also a clever metaphor. They hold bamboo canes in their hands, turn their eyelids outward, and hide the black pupils. It is a wonder that they even know makeup techniques. The street cries include sentences like, "Looking up, I cannot see the road to heaven; lifting my feet, I cannot see the height of the road." Such things cannot be fully recorded. "Rotten Beauty" sitting begging also belongs to this gang. On the surface, they are covered in sores, displaying themselves on the side of the road. In reality, most of them use the makeup techniques passed down by the beggar gang. In addition, there are those who kneel by the roadside and knock their heads loudly, turning their foreheads into walnut-sized lumps. They also belong to this gang, which will be described in detail later.</p>
<h3 id="e209">As the Year-End Approaches, Wang Xiaoer Runs Away <a href="#e209" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c209" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">209</a></h3>
<p>— Wu Shujiang</p>
<p>"I, Wang Xiaoer, am unfortunately named Wang, and unfortunately named Xiaoer, so in the past, people in society, when national affairs went badly, when the business market was sluggish, when they themselves were not trying hard, they all used me, Wang Xiaoer, to make fun, 'Wang Xiaoer spending the New Year,' 'getting worse year after year.'</p>
<p>I, Wang Xiaoer, am just a little poor, but I have never done anything to harm the country. I have never done the manipulation and speculation that unscrupulous merchants do. Why is it that when national affairs go badly, I am used to make fun, and when the business market is sluggish, I am also used to make fun? Since entering the Republic of China, it is difficult for Xiaoer to get through the New Year without hearing these insulting words. I am really angry.</p>
<p>Now that the War of Resistance has been won, and more than a year has passed since the victory, national affairs should gradually be on the right track, and the future of the country is nearing a splendid and glorious state. What about the business market? Under the guidance and supervision of the government, it will naturally be calm and prosperous day by day. What about the people? After this long War of Resistance and victory, they will certainly be motivated and strive to become new citizens. As I, Wang Xiaoer, greet the thirty-sixth year with national rejoicing, I formally bid farewell to the people of the country, forever bid farewell, deeply wishing that from now on there will be no Wang Xiaoer like me in society, and even more wishing that from now on, when society encounters things that go badly, no one will use me, Wang Xiaoer, to make fun."</p>
