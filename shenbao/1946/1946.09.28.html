<h3>美對在華駐軍　現尚無撤退意　認吏達林表示係外交策略</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕華盛頓廿七日廣播：華盛頓官方表示，美政府此時並無撤回其在華軍隊之意。消息靈通方面認爲，史達林之反對美軍駐華，不過爲一種外交策略，目的在轉移世人之目光，藉以掩飾蘇聯在東歐之行動，而非眞欲迫使美國退出遠東。美政府對於駐華美軍之實力雖秘不宣布，但官方公然承認駐華美國陸軍僅三四千人，海軍陸戰隊約二萬二千人，海軍極少數，總共不過二萬五千人之譜。如無意外發展，美軍將繼續留駐中國，至維持秩序及調停中國內戰之工作完成時爲止。政府方面表示意見稱：美海軍陸戰隊一旦撤退，共軍必切斷鐵路交通綫，並阻斷滬，粤區工業界所需之煤來源，彼等深信，美軍撤退後，中國各地必立刻發生騷亂。詢以美軍是否協助國軍從事內戰，彼等答稱：「美軍駐華，絕對保持中立地位」，並强調謂，目前美軍已不復空運中國政府軍隊，亦不供給彼等以食糧及軍需品。</p>
<h3>吳鐵城氏批評　葛羅米柯演詞</h3>
<p>〔合衆社南京廿七日電〕中央黨部秘書長吳鐵城，本日接見記者，對於蘇聯代表葛羅米柯最近在安全理事會中之指責，加以批評稱：「美軍駐華斷不致危及世界和平，反之，適足以促成世界和平。余意，外國軍隊未得他國政府之許可，而留駐該國領土，纔足以危害世界和平耳，」渠雖未明白指出，但顯係針對違反條的規定，而繼續留駐在東北若千地點之蘇聯軍隊而言。吳氏種：「所謂退出中國週』運動，係上海少數親共份子所發起，不過爲延安之傳聲筒而已。」渠强調稱：「美軍犧牲其物質上之舒適，來至中國，乃繼續履行其盟邦之重大使命而已吾人對於美軍以往及今後之所爲，同樣重視。</p>
<h3>主席接見司兩使　王外長晉竭報告國際局勢　司使致周恩來函已送抵滬</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿七日電〕首都政治商談空氣，已因主席旋京而增濃，但周恩來仍滯滬上，故無顯著進展。昨日馬特使與司徒大使聯名致周恩來之函件。聞內容簡單，即深切希望周氏早日返京，共商和平大局，此函已由共黨代表團派專人於廿六日夜車攜滬交周。若干人士認爲，共黨是否堅持成見，或有其他意見，對此函件　有一明確答覆。馬特便廿七日上午十一時曾趨車赴黃埔路官邸訪謁蔣主席，談四十分鐘，下午五時半，司徒大使亦偕其私人顧問傳涇被趨車往謁主席，至六時一刻始出，談話內容均係申述和平商談之接觸情形。據聞，目前情勢仍側重於共黨態度問題，因政府從政治方面着手解決問題之態度，乃循調人司徒大使之建議，且爲共黨所同意者，今忽反汗，恐不待三人會召開，共黨又有新的韓變，觀察家亦認爲國共糾紛勢非循政　途徑解決不可，根本問題不解決而談其　，實爲捨本逐末。又四時傅涇波曾訪吳鼎昌，泛談時局。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿七日電〕司徒大使廿七日　十時曾與往訪之澳大使晤談一小時，下午五時並在其公館內舉行茶會，招待敎會方面美籍人士，且邀馬特使參加。司使對教會人士極感興趣，廿八日午將宴請今日自漢抵京之于斌主敎　宜國防部長白崇禧，外長王世杰，政院秘長蔣夢麟請氏，凡此皆足顯示沉悶多日之和平商談轉趨活躍。</p>
<p>〔聯合社南京廿七日電〕中共發言人王　南稱：昨日曾接司使一函，已轉送上海，交周恩來閱看，預料今明日即可得復，周氏回京與查，視馬使與蔣主席談話結果而定。中共仍堅持恢復軍事三人小組會議，討論全面停戰，五人小組會議則可不必舉行。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社南京廿七日電〕蔣主席廿七日接見王世杰外長，留其午餐，聞王外長向主席報吿參加巴黎和平會議經過及國際局勢。</p>
<h3>五五憲草立法精神　根據五權憲法理論　政協審議之修正稿尚需追認</h3>
<p>吳經熊熊談話</p>
<p>〔中央社本市訊〕舉國矚目之國民大會，即將於十一月十二日揭幕，該會主要使命，爲制頒憲法，實施憲政，前經立法院三讀通過五五憲草屆時將提交該會討論，以爲產生一部完整的中華民國憲法之根據，記者爲明瞭五五憲草之立法精神，及各方面之綜合意見起見，昨特趨訪立法院前憲法起草委員會副委員長吳羅能博士，叩詢內容，渠稱：欲使國家政治步入現代化的正常軌道，吾人自不可忽視憲政時期之重要性，但實施憲政之先決條件，必須要有一部良好的憲法，年來政府對於制　準備工作，極爲重視，此一工作，在立法院孫院長　主領導之下，博採與論，　度國情　經過長時期之考慮，三讀會議的程序。始產生了一部五月五日公布的中華民國憲法草案，即節稱的「五五憲華」，該憲草的基本精神，　重兩點。（一）根據五權憲法的理論。（二）採取各民主國家的特長。吳氏並稱：泰西各國的政治，不是偏於人民有「權」，便政府陷於無「能」的狀態，便是政府有能」，而人民少「權一，因此國父中山先生對於憲法的卞張，特別置重於人民有「權」，政府有「能一點，此實爲民主國家憲法理論上，一個最新最可寶貴的供獻。五五憲草，即根據此一精神而制定，最近美國法學權威龐德先生返國之前，本人曾與渠對五五憲草作過數度硏究，渠對該憲草大體非常滿意，特別是對於中國實行總統制一點，極表贊同。渠曾申述內閣制似不適用於中國，因泰西各國，實行內閣制最爲成功者，祇有英國一國，但其主要背景，乃由於英國人民經過憲政歟百年的訓練，養成憲政的習慣，中國人民對於此點不能與英相提並論；渠認爲五五憲草，倘能通過，中國將成爲十分現代的民主國家，渠同時以爲憲政重在實行，不能斤斤計較於文字之間，祇在其是否適合國悄而已。至於本人意見，五五憲草並非不能改動，惟如有所改動，決不能離開國父畢生心血，從政治經歷中所結晶之五權憲法理論而已。談至此，記者復提出數問題，由吳氏答覆如下：</p>
<p>（問）對於本届國民大會職權，僅限於制憲，抑兼行憲一點，意見如何</p>
<p>（答）本人以爲：（一）召開國民大會，殊非易事。（二）由同一機關制憲而兼行憲，易於發現憲法的缺點，便於修正，因此本人主張，本届國民大會職權，最好爲制憲而兼行憲。</p>
<p>（問）國民大會閉會期間，是否　有一常設機構？</p>
<p>（答）如另設常設機構，恐怕要造成「太上政府」，不能賣現「權」「能」分開的理論。</p>
<p>（問）政協憲草審議會，對五五憲草意見如何？</p>
<p>（答）該會審議結果，離開五五憲草原有立法精神並不遠，當時各黨各派曾有一種諒解，所擬修正稿，並非最後結論，必需經過各黨各派最高機關予以追認，其中最重要的修正，爲在憲草內另增「中央與省之權限」一章。</p>

<h3>參政員尹述賢等提議　匯率不得再貶低　參會駐會委會决議交小組審查通過請政府救濟滇晋等省災荒</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿七日電〕參政會駐會委會第九次例會，廿七日晨在國民大會堂二樓舉行，到尹述賢·范予遂等，由邵力子主席，司法行政部長謝冠生報告最近司法行政設施及漢奸案件辦理情形，略稱：司法機關復員，自去年十月起至本年八月止，高等法院遷回原址辦公者計十二起，高分院十六，地方法院九十二，司法處一百五十五，共計二百七十五單位。關於儲備司法人員，上年曾舉行司法人員考試一次，錄取一百八十一名，本年第一次考試，錄取四百零三人，各大學司法組約可錄取一百卅九人現登記司法官經審查合格者，計一百九十人，審判官一百零二人，軍法人員廿八人。關於辦理漢奸案件情形，謝氏稱：截至八月止，據報已起訴者七六四件，不起訴者二七六三件，判決科刑者二九七二件，無罪者八七九件。又調查戰爭罪犯，本年一月至六月間，已送外交部一三九八三案，被告經審查成立犯罪者一二六二人。謝氏最後述及美法律家龐德此次來華，對我貢獻甚多，　氏精通英美法與大陸法，渠認爲我國採行大陸法甚合宜，但應更求適合國情，渠並建議我國法與尚不完備，應由政府請法律專家銓註民刑法真諦，以免解釋紛歧及適用時之不統一，此項意見，吾人正在考慮中。旋各參政員對於前次羅參政員衡所提檢舉何德奎案，向謝氏提出質詢，辯論甚烈。繼討論提案：（一）任純武等提，請政府迅速救濟滇西災荒，並减低滇省徵糧數額案，決議送請政府迅速辦理。（二）武肇煦等提，山西災情嚴重，尤以大同民屬及上黨流亡在豫陜各地者，厥狀更慘，請政府速派大員地帶鉅款·食物，施與急賑，以活民命案，決議送請政府迅速辦理。（三）　揆一等提，國立專科以上學校教職員生活補助費標準，應當一致，廢止分區調整辦法，以救濟高等教育危機案，決議交小組審查。（四）請政府迅速援救荷印被害僑胞案，決議送請政府迅速辦理。（五）榕厦米荒嚴重，請糧食部撥借款項，購運米糧，調節民食案，決議送請政府辦理。（六）薛明劍等提，請政府飭知中　公司，改善收購乾　辦法，決議送請政府迅速辦理。（七）尹述賢等提，外匯調整後，物價飛漲，金融市塲愈形紊亂，應請政府迅謀妥善辦法，並不得再貶低匯率，以紓民困案，決議交小組審查。</p>
<h3>參政會駐會委員　質詢何德奎案　謝部長解釋引起激辯</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿七日電〕參政會駐會委會例會謝部長報告中，對於參政員羅衡前提檢舉何德奎案辦理經過，一字未提，各參政員僉表不滿，紛紛質詢，由謝氏解釋嫌疑漢奸罪有下列二點，（一）在偽組織下工作者，（二）有通謀敵國行爲者，何德奎以在國際組織之工部局任職，非完全偽組織機關，至是否即屬通謀敵國等情，自可加以研究，旋並報告何德奎一案，經由國防最高委會通知政院，並由政院通知司法行政部，該部當即派員赴滬調查，並有報告，此項報告已轉呈國防最高委會，上次國防委會開會時，曾討論甚久，尚無結果。關於羅參政員所提證據，即簽用偽教科書一事，謝氏稱：此項公事，係於六月廿四日自屬僚簽呈，何則於七月廿七日始簽行，延遲三十餘日，雖不能謂足以减輕罪行，但亦不能謂爲通謀敵國（按是時何任工部局教育處長，日人岡本任總董，該項簽署成立後，各學校即改用偽教科書）。謝解釋畢，參政員范予遂·許孝炎·尹述賢等均不滿，認爲政府不應稽延辦理。羅衡則提出意見，加以駁斥，約如下述：工部局如不能認爲是偽組織，則何種機構係偽組織，如稱在敵偽控制下之汪記政府係偽組織，則敵偽控制之工部局，又何能不是，故此點應請由法律上解釋。其次，自工部局經敵人接辦後，政府曾囑原工作人員撤退，而何則未撤退，顯有漢奸行爲，此事未經司法界注意，亦未檢舉，但實有提起注意之必要。又政府派員前往調查時，忽有遺失卷宗之事，亟應追究。旋再稱：工部局可謂非敵偽組織一點，應加以研究，至何對簽署延遲時日一事，則不足以說明减低其罪行之效能，而司法行政部之報告，並非判決書，國防最高委員會可加以討論，至此，羅再提一說明，認爲工部局能否稱國際組織，不應從形式上看，應從實際上加以研究，例如上海高等法院，曾辦理黃福森一案，黃係在巡捕房工作者，巡捕房與工部局性質相同，過去均係國際組織，然黃福森即以通謀敵國論罪，而何則非是。是時，參政員尹述賢再稱，通謀敵國是非不談，推行奴化教育屬實，當屬不利於國家民族者，辯論極爲激烈，所提意見甚多，旋決定下次會中討論，至一時許散會。</p>

<h3>顧全大局不爭小節</h3>
<p>政府和共黨的和平商談，自前天　蔣主席返京以後，又有轉機的空氣。我們老百姓，急切希望這種空氣日益濃厚，而尤其祈禱不終止於空氣。我們愛好和平，同時也深信政府盼望和平；在將近兩個月的軍事周旋以後，我們猜想今天的中共也許同樣企求和平。故目前乘　蔣主席回京，馬帥司使提出折衷辦法的時候，雙方代表如把握此一良機，勿使溜遏，則中國的和平統一，在最後關領，當有實現的可能。</p>
<p>要實現中國的和平統一，最主要的條件當然在乎政府和中共雙方都具有誠意。但徒具誠意還不够，必須雙方都有遠大的識見與寬闊的胸襟。有了偉大的識見，才能顧全大局：有寬闊的胸襟，才能不爭小節。雙方如均能顧全大局面不斤斤於爭執小節，我們相信同是中國人，只要不是甘心聽命於異族，那有什麼事不可商量而必動武？在以往，也許其黨自恃其逆擊武力，以爲可與中央一決雌雄，故僅視和談爲爭取進攻時間的過程，而並沒有誠意；但經過近來兩個月的試騐，共黨應該覺悟了吧，武力未必可靠，還是回頭來誠心誠意的求政治解決爲妙。在以前，也許政府認爲共軍盤據要衝，阻斷交通，政府不能因爲和談而聽其　割；但目前蘇北戰事不久可望結束，幾個重要據點也已逐漸收復，政府原來盼望共軍退出的區域，共軍勢力業已削弱，政府或也感覺無再堅持反攻的必要了吧。所以，如果雙方把眼光放遠一些，把胸襟放寬一些，則在此時重開和平商談，不失爲最好機會，而且可望有所收穫。</p>
<p>前此和平商談的所以受阻，就在先開五人小組抑或先開三人小組之爭執，換言之，還是先議國府改組還是先談軍事停戰的爭執。其實停戰一端，已經再三頒令，而國府改組交換意見也不止一次，先談後談，更無意義。現在馬司兩位調人建議，大致三人小組五人小組同時召開，軍事政治　籌並顧，這邦是深得中庸之道，現在只等候中共代表周恩來氏是否返京的答復了。從前有個笑話，大科學家牛頓家裏　有大貓小貓，板壁乃特　大小洞各一，以便兩貓之出入。其實，有了大洞，小貓何嘗不可以進出自由？今天爲了和平商識，特來爭執五人小組與三人小組，其可笑得毋類此？我們老百姓實在苦够了，討厭戰亂也討厭够了，那有　心情來聽此種無聊的爭執。我們誠　的　求雙方，務必顧全大局，勿爭此類小節。</p>
<p>爲政府計，我們要勸中　要人，仰體上天好生之德，與主席愛民之心，反攻共軍，適可而止，只須中共表示願意參加改組的政府，誠心參加制憲的國大，則大局安定已有把握，中國人民幸福可期，其他一切儘可從容商討，不必再行勞師動衆。爲中共計，我們更要勸他們的領袖，不必以中國歷史上的草莽英雄自居，抱着「成則爲王，敗則爲寇」的陳腐思想，應該放開眼界，學學世界上民主先進國家的反對黨的作風，放下槍砲，鼓起唇舌，跳出戰塲，走入　塲，則今天縱然在戰塲上退出了幾個城市鄉鎮，安知他年不在議塲上多佔幾個議席？而况老實說，中共也該看個明白，目前——至少在這數年間·蘇聯未必決心和美國作戰，你們也何必自告奮勇以爲可在中國戰塲上先來擺起反美的姿態？而中國戰後的建設復興，正有賴於一切盟邦的援助，我們內部如果和平團結，則任何外來的助力，無論資本與技術，均可源源供給，中國前途大有指望，中共如不欲爲民族的罪人，更不當拿製造戰亂來阻礙中國的建設。所以，我們爲人民計，爲兩黨計，都不能不苦過政府與中共雙方，大家顧全大局，不爭小節，來完成和平統一的歷史任務。</p>
<p>誰能率先表示不爭小節，誰能澈底表示顧全大局，誰就能得人民的擁護，誰就能得國　　　　。</p>

<h3>希臘內戰幕後有人牽綫　英美決採堅定立場　英駐軍不撤維持秩序安寧</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓廿六日電〕今日據高級當局消息：美政府正擬採取一種「硬性」政策，以應付蘇聯在希臘局勢中可疑的活動，其第一步或將在金融及謂濟方面再度援助希臘。美國務卿員爾納斯已在巴黎與英外相貝文討論此種局勢，雙方顯已商定，英美政府對於希臘，一如其對於伊朗及其他勢力衝突之處，應絕對堅定其立塲。據幕後跡象觀之，希臘北部負嵎頑抗政府軍之共黨車，係自南斯拉夫及阿爾巴尼亞獲得軍火接濟。熟悉全局之某外交官稱，希臘北部此種「爬行戰」已使華盛頓方面甚爲關切，蓋直接交戰者雖係　爾小國，但其背後則爲大國問之勢力衝突，此乃危險所在。英美方面以爲唯有兩國共同採取「强硬態度援助希政府，始能控制此種衝突，否則蘇聯不免假道希臘向南擴展勢力，取得控制東地中海地位。</p>
<p>〔合衆社倫敦廿六日電〕政府方面今日聲稱：倘希臘軍隊不能鎭壓馬其頓共黨叛變時，則英國軍隊或將出而干涉希臘內戰。關於英國司令奉令不許參加希臘內戰之報導，業由外交部加以否認，並强調稱：英軍留駐希臘之目的，爲安定政府地位與維持和平秩序。</p>
<p>〔聯合社薩隆尼加廿六日電〕希臘軍隊正在北部進行軍事行動。據希臘官方稱，曾有暴徒一隊自阿爾巴尼亞東面通過南斯拉夫邊境攻擊希臘前哨站，攻軍利用白動武器與手溜彈，但被驅退。同時，聞英軍司令部正在改編該處三萬名駐軍，英軍兩師中聞將有一師自希臘微退。又據倫敦電訊：英外部發言人稱，希臘北部政府軍與左翼叛軍之戰爭，以南斯拉夫及阿爾巴尼亞邊境以南爲最烈，向西擴大至保加利亞邊境以南區域。英政府無意立即自希臘撤退駐軍。</p>
<p>可能招致嚴重後果</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敦廿六日電〕倫敦觀察家覺希內戰若擴大至於全國，而英軍猶未撤畢，則後者殊難不被牽涉。支持希政府之人咸認左翼遊擊隊，在南阿兩國甚至保加利亞之協助下，可能超過政府軍之力量，卒使英軍不得不出而干涉。目前希北部鄰邦之支援左翼遊擊隊，日趨明顯而積極，最後恐不免壓倒政府軍。其可能引起之結果有三：（一）英軍立即撤退，不顧希臘軍之命運；（二）外國作大規模而不公開之干涉，造成如西班牙內戰之同面：（三）英國及斯拉夫國之助戰，公然承認。此三者中以最後一種現象最爲危險，可能引起戰火普遍之燃燒。</p>
<p>土國鞏固邊疆防務</p>
<p>〔聯合社雅典廿六日電〕據伊斯丹埠消息，土耳其對於希北部所謂「小規模內戰，採取鎭靜態度，不致出以何種行動。土耳其已在韃靼尼爾海峽以北鄰近希臘邊境之色雷斯省鞏固防務，一部份人對於希臘局勢之惡化是否如所傳之甚，不無懷疑，惟居住色雷斯省之土耳其人數百名，正紛紛逃回本國，以避希臘共黨之迫害，據土耳其報載，三日前逃回本國者八百人，無法逃出者，謂正遭「殺戮」云。</p>
<h3>希臘王返國復位　共黨提參加政府條件</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦廿七日電〕希臘國王喬治今日自倫敦乘飛機返希臘某港，希太子及公主自亞歷山大港乘驅逐艦至該地迎接。</p>
<p>〔聯合社雅典廿六日電〕本市定週六晨一律休業歡迎國王，警局爲戒備起見，已宣布禁任何人屆時携帶武器，國王行列所過之處，沿途人民不得任意行動，居民不得在百碼以內之屋頂或陽台眺望。</p>

<h3>英蘇逐角下得希臘</h3>
<p>— 本報資料室</p>
<p>戰時流亡倫敦的希臘國王喬治二世，由於此次公民投票中絕大多數人民的擁護，已於今日返國復位。希臘自一九四一年四月間爲德軍侵入，致吿淪亡以後，迄今五年有半，又得恢復了它戰前的政治秩序，這自然是一件大喜事。但這件事情，尤其在此英蘇在巴爾幹角逐爭覇的今日，却還有着一重更深的意義。</p>
<p>希臘，這古代政治和文化的歷史上光芒萬丈的國家，在近百餘年來，也眞可說是歷盡了滄桑，自五世紀時羅馬帝國分裂以後，一四七三年希臘這塊土地就爲土耳其所併吞。直至一八二一年爭取獨立的革命運動爆發，經過了八年的流血苦鬥，終告成功，乃脫離土耳其而獨立。但土耳其的統治甫告終止，俄國的勢力便已踏入。一八二八年獨立運動尙未完全成功的時候，曾任俄皇亞歷山大外相的約翰凱普伯爵，被選爲希臘共和國的總統，但由於他過分的親俄政策和政府的專制獨裁，使希臘人民大感不滿，新總統終於被殺。一八三〇年宣佈改政制爲君主，並選舉了巴伐利亞的奧托親王爲希臘的首任國王。此時希臘係在英國法國和俄國三方面的保護之下，而政府的領袖們，亦各形成親英親法和親俄三種　團，互相對立。一八六二年，奧托被逐去國，由於英國方面的支持，亞爾茀親王被選繼承了王位，而從此以後，英國在希臘的勢力也就遠超出了俄國之上。</p>
<p>一九二三年，現在的國王喬治二世即位。次年三月，國內發生革命，建立共和，國王逃亡出國。至一九三五年由於公民投票的結果，贊成恢復君主政體，喬治二世乃又返國。在這次世界大戰的初期，希臘原是宣佈中立的，但由於它政府的親英態度，早已遭德義之忌。一九四〇年義大利向希臘提出最後通牃，要求由義軍佔領希境內若干戰略要地，希政府覆牃拒絕，義軍乃自阿爾巴尼亞邊境入侵，德軍亦出兵相助，希臘方面雖有英軍的援助，但仍節節敗退，一九四一年四月，京城雅典淪陷，英軍和希政府都退到了克里地島，德軍旋又以傘兵降落克里地島，繼，本已大部在蘇聯的勢力之下，所以希臘的地位，自更爲英國所重視。這一塊面積只廣五〇，一四七方　的小小土地，目前已佔着地中海上極重要的戰略地位，它西北的阿爾巴尼亞，北面的南斯拉夫，和東北的保加利亞，都已成了蘇聯的勢力範團。而它木身則東瀕愛琴海與土耳其遙遙相望，西近亞特里雅海，南面則正對着一片浩瀚的地中海，如果蘇聯的勢力再侵入這一帶地方，則英國在地中海的覇權，勢即將完全動搖了。</p>
<p>這次的公民投票，決定贊成國王復位抑或另組共和政府，結果，一，七七九，九二四張選票中，贊成國王復位者達一，一三五，六七五票，反對者僅五二一，五四〇票，其餘的則爲廢票。這件事情，在英國方面固然是一次大成功，但在另一方面，也象徵着蘇聯南進勢力的一次大挫折。　在投票以前，蘇聯即曾發動大規模的外交攻勢，始則指責英軍的駐留希臘爲危害和平，繼則唆使烏克蘭在最近的聯合國安全理事會中對希臘提出控訴。這在蘇聯的意思原是一種外交壓力，並挑撥希臘人民對英國的疑懼，但不料結果竟弄巧成拙，反致引起了大部分希臘人民的反感。這次公民投票的結果。擁護君主的一派所以能獲得如此出乎意外的勝利，其原因就在此。最近巴爾幹和中東這一帶，外交上一連發生了三件事情，都象徵着蘇聯力量的低落，（一）是在土耳其，由於俗英美的支持，土耳其强硬地拒絕了蘇聯對共管韃靻尼爾海峽的要求。（二）是在南斯拉夫，關於南國擊落美運輸機兩架的事件，由於美國的强大壓力，和蘇聯的未能給予南國以責際的支持，結果使南斯拉夫不得不完全屈服。（三）就是在希臘，這次的投票結果更使蘇聯遭受了一次嚴重的打擊。所以這次的希臘公民投票，並不只是一個國王能不能够回來的問題，而是背後代表着英國和蘇聯，西方集團和蘇聯集團間在巴爾幹半島上勢力的消長。</p>
<p>目前，希臘共軍已起叛亂，內戰可能爆發，而如果希臘政府無力遏制，則駐在希境的英軍將出而干涉，協助紋平內亂。這事會不會引起背後二强的衝突，在此國際風雲多變，草木皆兵之際，實在是一件値得隱憂的事情。</p>

<h3>參議會請願團　決定後日晉京　昨日談話會中決議　再提三項綱領　確立經濟政策在滬設立經濟復興會　撥發復興上海市專欵</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕市參議會十一參議員組織向政府建議從速改善金融政策晋京請願團，昨日下午三時，在福明　市參議會舉行談話會，除王參議員先靑刻在杭州外，到徐副議長寄廎，參議員徐國懋，金潤庠，駱淸華，王延松，陶百川，楊撫生，奚玉書，兪佐廷，劉靖基等十人，潘議長公展亦往參加。席間首由潘議長報吿外界對此次請願團之看法兩點：（一）有一部份人士之意見，認爲前次工商界晋京請願結果，未得要領，深恐此次參議員請願團將蹈覆轍，仍無結果。（二）但尙有若干人士表示，此事關係重大，請願結果無論失敗成功，其任務仍屬必要，至少能使政府明瞭上海市民之意見，同時亦係令國人民之願望，故對請願團致其殷切期望。潘議長繼稱，此次請願絕非羣衆運動，而爲合乎情理之陳述，故望代表團在未出發前，先行研究及分別決議案中最要者及次要者，並交換意見，以作準備。</p>
<p>繼由徐副議長提議，各議員同意，決於下週一（卅日）分別晋京，十月一日上午九時，在南京浙江興業銀行相聚後，即赴行政院請願，十月二日上千，赴國防最高委員會請願。並上呈文代電致國民政府主席，中央黨部中央常務委員會，行政院長，財政部長，經濟部長，農林部長，交通部長，及國防最高委員會。此外特另電國民政府文官長吳鼎昌及侍衛長兪濟時，行政院秘書長蔣夢麟等，請代呈報接洽時間，晋見主席，宋院長及各部部長。代表等定十月二日即返滬。晋京旅費，均由代表各自擔負。請願團返滬後，將舉行記者招待會。</p>
<p>談話會決議再行提出三項綱領，擬向最高當局陳述：（一）確立經濟政策，政府在戰時之經濟政策，實有錯誤，而戰後再引用前策，更屬錯之又錯，目前政府對於經濟措施，「說」管說而「做」管做，兩者亳不統一，如此則經濟前途，將不堪設想。政府要挽救工商業危機，勢必表裏一致實行，嚴格奉行總理遺敎，實行三民主義之經濟政策。（二）在機構方面：政府應在上海設立一經濟復興委員會。緣此次戰事勝利後，中央在滬設立許多機關，接收大量物資，然至今未曾舉辦一救濟及復興上海經濟之機構，故擬呈請中央，爲上海設想，籌立一正式機構，要求宋院長親任會長之職，市長及參議會議長任副會長，並邀本市大小工商金融機關法團共同參加，則至少亦能使政府與人民互相瞭解各方困難。（三）要求中央以敵產處理局接收物資款項撥出百分之五十，作爲復興上海市之專款。</p>
<p>又經議員發表意見，認爲此項組織，應有持久性，希望政府重視民意，盡力協助，務使達到目的爲止。請願團向政府各有關機關所上呈文如下：</p>
<h3>建議電文</h3>
<p>抗戰勝利，已逾一年，因國家經濟政策，未盡附合人民期望，金融措施，未能配合復興計劃，馴至物價日漲，幣値低落，生產更陷絕境，財政益失平衡，入超數字，與日俱增，經濟崩潰，逼於眉睫，處理敵僞產業，辦法失干，人謀不臧，民怨沸騰。本市夙爲全國經濟金融重心所在，深悉底蘊，痛感切膚，乃於本會首届第一次大會開幕以來，即經本市商會銀錢兩業同業公會，中國茶葉協會等團體，及參議員王正廷，駱淸華·劉靖基·勞敬修。美懷素等，針對時弊，提出具體解救方策，復經本會別分縝密審査，提請大會愼重決議在案，茲特撮其綱要臚陳如左：</p>
<p>關於調整銀行業務者</p>
<p>（一）爲增進國家銀行之辦事效率起見，應請政府加強銀行之專業化，中央銀行允須履行其「銀行之銀行」職務，辦理重貼現與轉抵押，俾銀錢業樂於接受生產貸款，同時减低存款準備金定率，並確認準備金之性能，加以活用。（二）商業銀行與工商業有密切關係，應請政府放寬對商業銀行管理辦法，切實扶植，以收間接扶植工商業之效。</p>
<p>關於調劑農工商業資金者</p>
<p>（一）各工廠生產資金，均感缺乏，應請舉行長期低利之有計劃工貸，俾能增加生產，保證償還。（二）對於工廠貸款，應由國營專業銀行調査各廠工業生產實際需要，低利貸放，其担保品，應不僅限於原料及製成品，凡廠房機器地產等，俱准提供作抵押品，其押匯與商品之運銷放款，並應積極承做，以期貨暢其流。（三）各地農村。因承歷年兵焚之後，舉儿種籽耕牛農具之購置，水利之　治，災害之防除，均有待於鉅額資金之借　，農業貸款，應繼續積極進行，至於農產輸出物品，如生絲桐油茶葉等之產製加工貸款，亦不可中止，秋收在望，穀賤傳農，爲維護農民生產利益計，亦望中國農民銀行，迅速舉辦穀貸棉貸，（四）各項貸款，應儘量以低利貸放，並簡化貸款手續。（五）爲防止通貨發行過多，可另辦實物貸款，應請政府以必要物炎，如生產原料燃料及機器設備等，貸給實需各廠，以發展共生產。（六）組織復興實業投資公司，資本定爲美金二十億元，由民間籌集四分之一，所有民間在海外資金，得先准投充，其餘四分之三，則向旅外華僑及彼邦人士招募，由政府規定保本付息，以資提倡。</p>
<p>關於發展國際貿易者</p>
<p>（一）實行進出口連鎖制度，（或使就金額上連鎖或依其種類上予以連鎖，如輸入棉花者，於若干時日內，負責將紗布輸出），並輔以貼補出口或實行高價收購，若干與易貨償債有關之物資，更應由政府高價收購，以維農業。（三）實行以貨易貨制度，例如抗戰初期，政府曾以茶業與蘇聯易貨，並空運美國接濟北非銷路，頗有相當成績，此項辦法，對於統制國際貿易之國家如蘇聯等，最爲適宜，亦爲目前茶商之逼切要求。（三）運用經濟外交，拓展市塲，以華茶一項而言，現有若干國家關稅，頗有不利華茶之規定，如英國限制今年華茶進口數量爲二百五十萬磅，僅爲一九三七年華茶輸英量之百分之二十，美國則因限制物價，對華茶限價極低。又如爲我國絲茶最大市塲之北非法屬摩洛哥，法政府有禁止華茶進口之命令，擬請政府循外交途徑，與各該國交涉，免除上述各種限制，以擴展華茶市塲，此外如北非綠茶市塲中心之卡薩布蘭卡，尙未設置領館，茶商因缺乏指導聯繫。貿易備受阻礙，亦擬請儘速增設領館，以資保護而利推進。（四）豁免外銷貨物之貨物稅，以輕成本。</p>
<p>關於活潑本市土地金融者</p>
<p>（一）對於土地金融，應請政府速訂辦法，積極實行，以發展農業金融事業。（二）銀行法草案，對銀行承受不動產後至重行出售之最長期限，僅以一年爲限，過嫌短促，應請修正。（三）上海工商業向銀錢業融通資金，向多以房地產爲押款之重要擔保，乃年來中中交農等銀行對工商業融通資金，皆不尤以不動產爲擔保，商業行莊因此亦不敢承受，此爲活潑土地金融之最大障礙，應請政府速予改善。</p>
<p>關於補償本市抗戰損失者</p>
<p>（一）復員工廠所受之一切損失，應請政府儘速予以補償，並以優惠條件，准其儘先承受沒收之敵僞工廠及原料品，以完成工業復員。（二）査敵僞產業處理局，在上海區處理之物資及工廠房屋，其標賣之款，總値可至一萬億元以上，均係敵僞搜括掠奪上海市民之膏血，自應歸還本市，俾得恢復元氣，即按諸中央與地方均權之義，亦應以半數撥歸本市，充作建設文化，及公益事業之用。</p>
<p>關於解救本市燃料恐慌者</p>
<p>查本市工廠林立，人口衆多，對於燃料之需求，爲數頗鉅，勝利以來，煤區煤斤，因交通阻梗，不克源源接濟，而中央然料管理委員會，對於煤之購置運銷，復加統制，而結果則以統制之名，行壟斷之實，以致煤荒日益嚴重，煤價日益上騰，長此以往，不特影響生產，抑且妨礙民生，應請迅予解除統制，俾鼓勵市民自由購置運銷，調劑供求，以蘇民困。綜上所述，皆爲本市目前最逼切之問題，本市商會，前於八月間第九屆大會後，曾綜合關於經濟建設方面重要決議，作成綱要，派員携同晋京，分謁中央常務委員會，國民政府，最高國防會議，行政立法兩院，及財政經濟兩部，請願在案·逎査時逾一月，均米率到切實批示，而中央最近調整匯價之事發生以後，對於獎勵出口一端，仍因生產成本高於國外市塲價格，出口貿易未見改善，國內物價反先隨之上漲。繼之四聯分處，又有否決八種生產貸款及國家銀行停止工貸之聲明，是更一錯再錯，徒見標榜「扶植生產事業獎勵輸出」之空名，而使生產界更陷於萬刧不復之地矣。本會宣達民隱，職責所在，觀夫水深火熱中之三百五十餘萬市民，喁望情殷，不忍再事緘默，除檢同原決議案六件分電外，爰特推派徐副議長寄廣·參議員奚玉書·王延松·令潤庠·劉靖基·駱淸華·陶百川·兪佐廷·王先靑·徐國懋及楊撫生等十一人爲代表，而陳實情，尙祈俯　本市危機，舉國與共，接受建議，逐一迅予施行，實爲公便·上海市第一屆參議會議長潘公展。副議長徐寄廎叩。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕江灣錢家塘鄉人錢金元，廿一歲。數年前憑媒娶江灣鎭烟紙舖主王福全之女鳳元（廿一歲）爲妻，育有一子。黃家道澱實，而錢金元則赤貧，因此偕妻鳳元遷居岳家，平時幫雜務，致遭黃姓闔宅卑視，而小夫婦間感情，亦日趨冷淡，時生口角。本月廿四日下午錢金元竊取岳家花棚上之玻璃二方中途被其內兄黃全興之叔伯妻舅黃全根所撞見，將其截獲，同返黃宅。岳父福全不間情由，即攫樹棒，對錢猛擊受傷。並用繩索捆綁，倒懸於樹上。金元遭此痛毆，大呼救命，一面竭力掙扎，繩斷仆地，即起身圖逃。孰知黃及十姪隨後緊追，追至一小河浜時，錢一時情急，躍入河中泅水至對岸而這。黃宅三人仍繞道追趕不捨。詎錢逃約半里之遙，又遇深約數丈之大河浜一條錢迫於追逐，紙得不顧一切。縱身入水，又擬泅渡·終因河面廣闊慘遭滅頂。未幾金元之母（五十九歲）聞訊，投報江灣分局，由分局長陳達恭派警趕往調査，一面將屍體撈起，報請法院勘騐。兇手黃福全等則已畏罪潛逃無蹤，現該警局正在跴緝中。</p>

<h3>李松齡案檢齊全卷　備文移送高檢察處</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕接收工作淸査團滬杭組前據密報：爲李松齡，勾結敵人驟致暴富，廣置房產，旣被査封，又復發還，事屬可疑，祈澈査究辦一案。茲悉：該團已向處理局調卷審査，認爲該李松齡是否漢奸，應由司法機關偵訊明確，査封人有無舞弊及處理局准予發還，是否確當，均應併同偵查。昨已檢齊全卷，備文移送上海高等法院檢察處査照辦理矣。</p>

<h3>颶風前翼去後　上海成了水都　污水蕩漾·深可沒膝　工務局說明年可改善</h3>
<p>〔本報特寫〕颶風前翼前日掠過本市。颶風過去了，却給上海留下了一片大水。林森路·中正路·南京路·大西路·華山路·勞勃生路……金不多整個上海市，凡是低窪一些的地方，全成了「中國威尼斯」。</p>
<p>在南京路，行人對於積水至多覺得不方便，至多覺得被黃包車夫多敲幾下竹槓而已。在林森路，蕩漾的水波，也許反替這一條整齊淸靜的街道坍添了不少詩情畫意。然而，在那人口密集的區域，在那工人貧民所謂下層階級集中的區域，水却顯得那樣醜惡，那樣惹人詛咒。</p>
<p>長壽路（勞勃生路）中央，大自鳴鐘四周，水深沒膝。乘十六路或者廿四路無軌電車經過，遠遠的就有一股臭味觸入鼻端。人們赤着足，捲起褲管，在那溷雜着各稱汚穢的臭水中行走。路兩旁低矮的陰暗的店舖和屋宇，水浸沒了裏面黑色的泥土，或者破舊的地板，顯得那樣潮濕，潮濕得使人心頭也像長起一層霉來。然而，居住在那些屋子裏的人們，照樣生活着，漠然的臉望着門外的具水傻笑。還有不少襤褸的瘦瘦的小孩子，水更替他們帶來了極大的歡樂。他們在水中跳躍·追逐·嬉卉·電車過處，激起一陣浪潮，他們用那小小的雙手撥起水花，笑得那樣高興。汚奧的水潭，在小心坎裏已如海洋那末偉大美麗。中國人的樂天知命，忍耐安分，難道從小就是這樣鍛鍊起來的嗎？</p>
<p>積水的成因，據說是潮門關閉，雨水來不及排洩的綠故。沿蘇州路到中正路，已建的潮門有一百六十四座，舊法租界一帶，另有三十座在建造中。其中最重要的聚嘉浜一處，下月中就可完工。還有一具每小時可以抽水六萬加侖的抽水機，將在今年臘盡春回的時候開始工作。工務局已經開出了一張支票，說是到那時候，舊英租界的日昇樓·愚園路·海寗路一帶，舊法租界的蘭心戲院附近，將不再有溝水倒灌的現象。這是一個大大的喜訊，値得報吿給上海市民。但是，我可又想起了那發臭的大自鳴鐘區域，想起了那許許多多不爲人注意的貧民區域，到那時候，是不是也不再會臭氣冲天了呢？</p>
<h3>人力車決取締　分三年淘汰完竣　十一月起抽籤</h3>
<p>關於取締本市人力車一案，蔣主席曾令行政院轉飭上海市政府，限期取締，飭即遵辦，如到冬季仍不遵辦，則以抗命論處。市政府奉令後，當即訓令公用局會同警察局社會局擬定辦法呈核。公用局遵令與警察社會兩局會商酌定：（一）由公用局用抽籤方法，分三年淘汰完竣。第一年先淘汰百分之十，的計營業人力車二〇六五輛，自用人力車六三〇輛，視成果如何，再定第二年淘汰之百分比。（二）人力車夫之救濟，由社會局詳擬辦法，並擬具管理取締人力車輛及經營造製人力車身及配件塲所實施辦法，由三局會呈市府核示。嗣據市商會函，以人力車夫多數籍隸蘇北，無家可歸，而本市工商各業日趨凋敝，勢難收容，請予從緩實行等情復經公用局呈由市府電請行政院准予通融，自明年起實施。茲以該案似難再事延緩，特由公用局參照前次三局會呈辦法，擬定呈施步驟：（二）十月一日起，開始辦理車夫及人力車與配件製造廠調査登記，預定一個月完成。（二）十一月一日舉行抽籤，決定淘汰車號，以總數百分之十爲標準，限年底以前繳回牌照。（三）十月起按照社會局擬訂小太貸款救濟辦法，先行準備十一月起中籤被淘汰而繳　牌照之人力車夫，予以小本貸款救濟。（四）關於小本貸金救濟辦法，由社會局從速計劃辦理。（五）關於擴充其他交通工具部份，現正由公共汽車公司籌備委員會妥擬計劃，並先添購大宗車輛擴充路綫。對於市郊及本市與鄰縣之聯繫，已由市郊公共汽車路綫審定委員會議決，分別將市郊各路綫交商辦理，俟奉市府核定，當限令十一月全部通車。以上係取締人力車一案之經過，及昨日市政會議通過之實施步驟·</p>
<h3>美記者被控案判決　侖道爾宣告無罪　分兩部份說明理由</h3>
<p>被告所發布之新聞證明非虛構</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕德籍納粹間諜嫌疑犯沈克，白訴美合衆社駐滬辦事處主任命道爾妨害名譽一案，昨日下午經地院宣判，命道爾無罪，其判決理由如下：本件分兩部說明：</p>
<p>程序問題</p>
<p>査刑事訴訟法第三百十一條規定，犯罪之被害人，得提起自訴，是自訴者，祇須因犯罪而直接被害之人別無何項限制，故是否敵國人民或戰爭罪犯而遺送回國者，均非所問。本件自訴人係德國僑民，將遣送回國，旋經美軍駐華總司令部，以戰爭罪犯娥疑提起公訴，尙覊押于美軍駐華司令部，依照上開說明，在我國政府尙未停止敵僑行使訴權之法令以前，尙非不能提起自訴，况一九〇七年海牙陸戰法規，慣例公約第二十三條規定：「除有特別條約所定例禁之外，其特加禁止者，如左……其第八款載明，將敵國人民之權利或訴權宣告爲無效，或在法庭上停止之，或不能執行之」等語。按此項規定在戰鬥章內，在戰鬥當時尙屬如此，在戰鬥狀態休止以後，其不能停止敵國人民之訴權，更屬當然之解釋，蓋訴權若不允許，則其一切私權將被非法侵害，有亂社會秩序，故近代國際公法，對於敵國人民居住交戰國法院管轄區域內者，均加保障，其訴權多不因而停止，國際法學者及各國判例均乏先例。再査我國刑法褫奪公權者，僅褫奪爲公務員之資格，公職候選人之資格，行使選舉，罷免，創制，複決四權之資格，刑法第三十六條，定有明文，訴權並不在被褫奪之列，則自訴人雖係戰犯而被禠奪公權，其訴權仍無影響。矧刑事訴訟法第二百九十五條規定，應諭知不受理之判決者，計「一，起訴之程序違背規定者，二，已經提起公訴或自訴之案件在同一法院重行起訴者·三，吿訴或請求乃綸之罪，未經吿訴請求或其吿訴請求經撤回或已逾吿訴期間者。四，曾爲不起訴處分或撤回起訴而遠背第二百三十九條之規定，再行起訴者·五，被吿死亡者。六，對于被吿無審判權者。七，依第八條之規定不得爲審判者」。對于敵僑或戰爭罪犯起訴者，並未列舉在內，若不受理，於法無據，是本件自訴人之自訴，在程序上尙無不合，特先說明。</p>
<p>實體問題</p>
<p>査本件自訴意旨，指卅五年四月十六日，上海英文字林西報刋有前德國民族觀察報記者沈克，曾在德國受特別訓練，充任納粹最高司令部之工作人員，美國當局稱，該沈克奉令派赴重慶，揭發有在沿海各城市活動之重慶方面秘密工作人員，並尋覓美國人及其他被禁人員逃至中國自由區之路綫之記載，係被吿所經理之美國合衆社所發佈之新聞，任意毁損其名譽等語。本院査散佈文字足以損害他人名譽之事實，能證明其爲眞實者，不罰，刑法三一〇條第三項載有明文。本件自訴人沈克，確係德國總司令部情報處「愛哈特」機關之特派員，在上海不法從事於軍事活動，藉以反抗美國及其盟友，搜集編輯和傳達有關美國及其盟友陸海空軍事活動消息，並供給「愛哈特」機關其他有利於日軍報道與援助，旣經美軍駐華總司令部査明起訴在案，復經本年六月十八日駐華美軍總部公吿處快報披露無遺，則被吿在字林西報刋佈上開新聞，不爲無據，况自訴人旣因戰犯覊押於美軍駐華司令部，爲自訴人所承認，則被吿更無誹謗之可言。至本年四月十六日新聞報申報所披露之新聞，旣非被吿合衆社所發佈，自與被吿無涉，且足證自訴人爲間諜已爲共知之事實。再自訴人提出之旅行護照，雖足證明自訴人於一九四一年七月，已由重慶經貴陽入越南轉河內來申，但自訴人抵申後，非不能再赴重慶，且不足爲自訴人並非間諜之證明，其提出陳介及吳紹澍之證明書，姑不論此項證明書之效力與具結之證言不同，難採爲判決之基礎，而被吿確係間諜，旣經美軍駐華司令部査明起訴在案，尙難以空泛之證明書相對抗，被吿所發佈之新聞，旣是證朋其非虛構，且非與公共利益無關，其行爲即不應處罰，爰爲諭知無罪之判決。據上論結，應依刑事訴訟法第三九三條第一項判決如主文·</p>
<h3>軍人强占房屋　限月底前遷出　警備部昨召開執行會議</h3>
<p>淞滬警備司令部前奉主席電諭，嚴令本市各軍事機關及軍人所佔民房，一律須於本月底以前遷出，如逾期不遷，則强制執行，昨日上午九時，各有關機關曾在警備部舉行執行會議，由宣鐵吾司令親自主持，除聽取憲兵團民政處及警察局三機構報吿調査經過外，並決定執行之步驟與方式。據悉：昨晨會議結果，規定即日至本月三十日，爲執行日期，執行機關以警備本部及憲兵團爲主，民政處警察局副之，其執行區域，當以警察局之編制爲執行區域之步驟，其執行對象，先就個人强佔者執行之，次爲機關，至非軍人强佔之房屋，則調査後交市政府處理。並悉該部此次接獲及調査强佔民房之案件，共達九百件之多，警備部等機關開始執行遷讓時，當予詳細調査，秉公處理云。</p>

<h3>北站黃牛黨跋扈</h3>
<p>前日上午十時、北站附近有上海魚市塲職員、在該處裝運到埠魚貨、正欲運回市塲、遵照部章集中交易，突有黃牛黨多人，蜂擁上前攔阻搬運。聲勢汹汹、頗爲緊張。嗣經魚市塲職員請該管分局派警協助，始吿平息。可見該處黃牛黨潛勢力依然存在。</p>
<h3>美眷屬海外大團圓　吉倫將軍盛會歡迎</h3>
<p>美軍司令吉倫將軍，及其最近抵滬之夫人，昨日下午假美軍長官俱樂部，舉行盛大之鷄尾酒會，歡迎美軍長官及其最近抵滬之眷屬。下午五時，盛會在樂聲悠揚中開始，吉倫將軍與其夫人立於大體堂前，與　賓一一握手，來自重洋之美感夫人，多衣飾華麗，而善於飼令、渠等對此東方大都市，均有無限好感，並殷殷請教華語之說法，昨日到會者，有吳市長夫婦，陳國　夫婦，謝　齡夫婦，美領事　維斯夫婦，陳納德將軍，美軍　部白魯德將軍夫婦。美海軍司令凱斯將軍，英國獨眼獨臂將軍魏亞特爵士，及其他各界　美軍長官與夫人等約二百餘人，吉倫將軍夫婦，周旋於嘉賓良友之間，至爲愉快，各賓客皆冒雨赴會，舉壞相慶，至晚七時餘始散。</p>

<h3>朱教長昨招待首都新聞界　報告當前教育問題　暨大教授解聘問題已派員調查　對學生失學問題期能盡量救濟</h3>

<p>留學考試　錄取名額</p>
<p>（三）留學考試，敎部公費生一百二十名，中法交換生五十名，中英文敎基金（即庚款）董事會二十名，共將錄取一百九十名，即可發榜。（四）後方大學生還鄕轉學，敎部僅能給予便利，不能分發，要自行投考。（五）各級學校，有人滿之患，年來敎育普遍發展，而戰時校舍毁損，因經濟關係，不易恢復，爲必然趨勢，美國亦有數十萬失學者，部中當作最大努力，期能盡量救濟。</p>
<p>中學小學　行二部制</p>
<p>（六）現在專科以上有一八二校，學生十二萬人，中學生一百十六萬三千人，小學生一千八百六十萬人、（七）中小學已實行二部制，每校皆可多收一倍學生，藉可放寬容納量。（八）戰時飾資缺乏，設備簡陋，敎育水準降低，此後當設法予以增進。（九）曁南大學敎授解聘問題，已派童大奚督學，即日赴滬調查眞相，以期公平合理解決。</p>
<p>復員經費　呈請追加</p>
<p>（十）全體敎育復員，各校旅運修建各費，經中央核定六百億元，因物價增高，車船各費俱加，事實上相差甚鉅，已依照中央核定行政費不得超過二倍至四倍之標準，呈請政院追加一千二百億元，尙朱奉核准。（十一）勝利後，國際地位增高，國際文化合作事務漸繁，前在高等司設科，辦理此事，今後將改科爲處，加强工作，並另在英美法蘇四國駐外大使館，設文化專員或參贊，以利進行，此事亦在呈核中。</p>

<h3>傳斯年明飛京　離平前將檢舉一漢奸</h3>
<p>〔本報北平廿六日電〕傅斯年廿九日離平飛京，今稱：離平前，將撿舉一漢奸，暗示此漢奸爲曾一度任僞北大校長而漏網者。渠之所以檢舉，乃因渠爲代理北大校長，故主張各首長應檢舉相當於彼之僞首長。傅氏認爲張燕卿宣判無罪，乃最糟糕的大事件」。傅氏對冀　綏綏察區淸査團批評，謂「其淸査往往以人爲對截」，但謂「劉乃沂大刧搜案，辦的還不錯」。最後嘆敎授待遇之薄日：「根本不能硏究學問」。</p>
<h3>一個緊急建議案　提高教師薪給</h3>
<p>美敎育當局在華盛頓會議</p>
<p>〔美國新聞處華盛頓廿七日電〕美敎育當局，近因學生人數，空前激增，及全國性之師資缺乏間題，已在此間會議，並提出緊急建議案，增加敎師薪給，每週至少四十五元或每年二千四百元。目前敎師平均年薪不及二千元，較政府其他公職人員相去甚遠，結果，在八十五萬名敎師中，約有三十五萬人紛紛改業。目下幹練敎師缺乏之成因，可歸納爲下列各點：（一）戰時師範學生减少，（二）出生率之急　提高，造成學齡兒童增加之滿果，（三）原擬獻身敎育之人，大半改業，　海外歸來之軍人，多擬升學，無意擔任務給低微之公立學校敎師。</p>

<h3>最近美鈔暴漲　金融檢查處查明　係有組織的投機　三泰裕與兩莊涉嫌最重</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕頃據中央銀行金融機構報務據查處處長李立俠談稱：近日美鈔及各種外幣市況之波動，純係有組織之投資買賣所引起。織改行近查一部份經濟外幣買賣之錢莊，每日呈報之乘數字，與各莊每日在票據所中之交換和，相養基遜。此中尤以三泰裕與兩錢莊，涉嫌最重。故昨日中央銀行已派負責查該兩莊帳目，如情節重大，決將共主持人，依法究辦。至其他涉嫌各莊，亦正嚴查中。同時，深學社會各界人士，如發現此類投操操藏之錢莊，可據量向中央銀行金檢處檢舉，以邀查辦。俾便整兩各錢莊業務，以安定金融市面。又據告：此次涉嫌之三泰錢莊，正爲三月前中央銀行黃金案中之主角。該莊因收買中央銀行被盜之金塊，而遭停業處分。乃前門被封不久，又從事後門交易，殊屬匪是。關該莊界就對講電話一項而言，即有數十具之多。現正由中央銀行澈查中。</p>
<p>嚴密檢查以後金紗均告平穩</p>
<p>烚赤昨央行仍加管制，加之查帳甚嚴，投機界還不敢活動，續形平穩。最關二一五萬五，開後會微告挺高至二一六萬七，終以壓力加多，四川路一帶小錢莊帳冊被檢查，人心不利，逐漸同小，十時後央行以二一五萬之價配給五〇條，十時後更爲萎嚴，午前曾退至二一四萬一下，午刻略回，午後現交平平，隔日交易買百蠢動，會升至二一七萬外而後定，結果與前收相仿佛，節金紋銀銀元均無變動，暗息仍在一角半左右。</p>
<p>外幣平穩少變，美鈔最開時高價不過三九七〇元，中途低價仍止於三九〇〇元，午刻微定，買賣雙方意與關珊，過程甚爲平和，午後隨金市微稍，升至三九九〇元，而後又定，結果較前收升十元，港票平穩，亦漲起五元，港匯始終在七八〇元左右徘徊，即匯降至九五五元有售，九三五元有買，英匯仍在一二五〇〇元至一二七〇〇之間，均無大變動，美匯牌價無對做。</p>
<p>公債穩定</p>
<p>公債昨甲乙種有外商洋行購買，於是形勢稍定，統丙最開一八〇〇元，開後會板高至一八五〇元，銀行方面忽稍來供給，即告不支，黨又降至一七二〇元，終以難牌見穩，臨收站一八〇〇之外，結果較前收微升三〇元，甲乙自一〇五〇起板高至一一〇〇元外，亦好三〇元，了種升五〇元，戊種則平。</p>

<h3>東北直接通匯中行免費代辦</h3>
<p>勝利迄今，業已年餘，東北因幣制間題，迄未通匯，最近始由中央銀行擬定工商匯款辦法，並擬定匯率，報由東北行營經濟委員會，轉呈政院核定實施。此間中國銀行，爲溝通東北與內地之經濟關係。發展工商業起見，已根據東北工商匯款辦法，開始辦理東北匯款，潘陽，錦州兩地業已通匯，由滬匯往東北之款，因解行係按中央銀行當日所掛匯率牌價，折合東北流通劵，付給收款人，由東北匯到此間之款，亦按匯日之牌價折合法幣應出。中國銀行爲扶持工商起見，匯款一律免收匯費。按中央銀行掛牌之回率，匯出爲一比十一元五，匯進爲一比十二元五。聞由國銀行對長春，營口，四平街筆處匯款，亦將繼續舉辦東北匯款，一旦暢通，關內外人士，極爲應奮，日來往該行匯款者，甚爲踴躍</p>

<p>人造絲漲風，令人咋舌，昨日又瘋狂般抬高七十餘萬元，一二〇號天橋開盤六十五萬元，較上日下午即升三十萬餘元，嗣後愈高，率做九十萬元收盤，下午最後四百九十七萬元有成交，難牌各號貨亦然跟進，但各張起六七十萬元之讀，然終因貨缺，故市價雖俏，而成交實僅四五箱而已。據業中人觀察，照目前情形言，人造絲來源一日無著落，市場人心終屬著好。廠家３方面，需要孔股，而市面實際存底，則日見枯薄。商號方面，存底更屬有限，需要者搜購逐愈見迫切，價逐只漲不跌。亟望有關當局，速從疏通來源，增加供應方面著手云。記者旋訪中央信任局購料易貨處經理何總林氏，探詢裝運日貨人造絲情形。據告：該局辦理對日易貨中，確有一部爲人造絲。至究竟數量著干，因時有惠動，未能有確數發表。最近確有一批人造絲，自日裝船運過。至抵過確期。因尚未接奉電訊，故不知其祥。強預料日內當可抵達。該批人造絲抵達後，浩可考慮評價供應市面需要去。</p>
<h3>配紗價未動　配出三千六百件　銷胃未足又被布市帶緊棉布仍多加碼且無售主</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕紗市最開略平，價格較昨日下降，計四十二支現貨二百九十萬，期貨二百八十萬元，二十支仍姑原盤，交易已不若以往數目之勇旺，旋以津幫起而吸收，布廠又以受配原料不足，逢低補進，價又高起二三萬元不等，但市場人心，多以紡建將離前日開布之作風，增加售額，不無警戒，故午前市價，終屬平平，下午則又見堅挺，除實銷戶查逢低收進外，布市之見好，亦爲之帶高不少，布市之見好，亦爲之帶高不少，設客幫暫無大量採辦，紗市勢將轉入盤旋之局。</p>

<p>布市漲勢已運繼兩週，自前晚紡建大批開出，日價格萬昂，得貨者不敢捏手，故昨市最開即入疲途，藍Ｖ細布做九萬元，三A彩球八萬四千元，陽鶴五福八萬一二千元，加以運朝陰雨，本街概銷銳減，實銷戶不觀望，散戶則以銀根趨緊，對於受配之貨，無力解款，不惜貼價脫手，市況逐見下游，無牌彩球貼出三千，白印畢幾貼出五千，甘支無牌貼出近千元，此對於習味申請開貨者，大足警戒，嗣以染繼廠家及有實力之客銷布號，逢低吸進，價又因好，不特貼價已無人脫手，加碼又盛高檔貨根予尤緊，畢幾有加碼三四千元而未見售主者，據市場消息，客幫胃口尚未吃足，如紡建不改變配售政策，漲風終難壓止，至於外傳黃牛當曼積等消息，據云純出於業外歂測，並非真相，天津幫方面透露消息，此間去路，多化整爲零，然後轉往東北，運繼雖難，地頭缺貨殊甚，並稱本市有著名之白貨字號數家，早已派人赴津，設立莊口，推進業務。</p>
<h3>國際商會報告　匯率穩定爲時尚早亟應遏止通貨膨脹</h3>
<p>〔路透通社倫敦甘六日電〕國際商會最近向聯合國經濟社會理事會提出報告，力當世界各國物價不穩定之調查性。並指出通貨膨脹爲當今全世界最緊要之現象，可能重演一九二〇——一九二一年之物價情形。在某種程度上，此種局勢並并單由於貨幣上之原因所造成，例如物資缺乏，生產不足以及成本高漲等，但在大多數國家中，貨幣間開實佔電壓地位，故防止通貨膨脹當爲前急務。然在若干國家中，國內部情形不甯，一時不易辦到，故在此一過渡時期中，必須設法救濟。世界國須矣性等問題解決，始能希望匯率穩定及發匯國際間之投資。</p>

<h3>談王安石與蘇軾的友情</h3>
<p>— 法爲洪</p>
<p>「女人相輕」，這當然不是文壇上正常的現象，至於「政治遮住了友誼，」那更是女人們硬行把自己安置在「狹的籠」中，又何必自言乃爾！中明先生說的好：「文友需要胸襟開闊，不要因爲彼此政治立場或見解之不同而相仇視，不要希望你的文友都是你的同志，要能容納各黨各派的文友。」（見九月十一日本刊文人友情與政治關係一文）因此筆者想起從前王安石和蘇軾的友情！就沒因政治立場或見解之不同而改變。</p>
<p>誰都知道蘇軾是詆毀王安石的新法最力之一人。他在宋神宗熙甯四年　開封府推官時，曾因新法不便，上疏極論。后來就有御史謝景溫緣他事論軾，移軾通判杭州。蘇軾此后一再遭到之貶謫，受了不少的磨折，都與詆毀新法有關。是他倆從政治關係上說，總算站在相反的方面了。可是他倆并不因此而改變了友情，對于各人文藝上的造詣，互相都很讚佩。我們且看下面幾段記載：</p>
<p>「東坡作表忠觀碑。荊公置坐隅。有客問曰：相公亦喜斯人之作？公曰：斯絕似西漢。坐客歡譽不已。公笑曰：西漢誰可擬！坐客或比以司馬禍如楊雄之流。公曰：相如賦子處大人洎輸蜀對禪書耳。雄所著太玄法言以準易，未見其敘事與瞻若此。直須與子長馳騁上下，如楚漢以來諸候王年表！」〔潘子真詩話〕</p>
<p>「舒王在鐘山，有客自黃州來，公曰：東坡近日有何妙語？客曰：東坡宿於臨阜亭，醉夢而起，作成都勝相葳記，千有餘言，點定才一兩字，有寫本，適留舟中。公遺人取而至。時有出東南，林影在地。公展讀於風簷，喜見眉鬚，曰：子瞻人中龍也！然有一字未穩。客曰：願之！公曰：日勝日貧，不若曰如善博，日勝日負耳。東坡聞之，拊手大笑，亦以公爲知言。」〔惠洪冷齊夜話〕</p>
<p>「東坡在黃州日，作雪詩云：凍合玉褸起粟，光搖銀海眩生花。人不知其使事也。后移汝海，過金陵，見王荊公論詩及此云：道家以兩肩爲玉褸，以目爲銀海，是使此否？坡笑之。退謂葉致遠曰：學荊公者，豈有此博學哉！〔趙德蹸候鯖錄〕</p>
<p>「全陵懷古，諸公寄詞於桂枝香，凡三十餘首，獨介甫最爲絕唱。東坡見之，不覺嘆息曰：此老乃狐精也！」（楊提古今詞話）他倆是如何的惺惺相惜！這正因彼此都重視友情的原故。至於政治立場或見解之不同，那是另一方面的事，不必併爲一談的。朱升的曲湖舊聞上說：</p>
<p>「東坡自黃徒汝，過金陵，荊公野服乘驉，謁於舟次。東坡不冠而迎揖曰：軾今日敢以野服見大丞相。荊公笑曰：禮爲我輩設哉！東坡曰：軾亦自知相公門下用軾不著。荊公無語，乃相招遊蔣山。」</p>
<p>蘇軾的話自然含有棘剌，可是也還蘊籍，既沒悻悻互置更沒悻悻絕交，這不是現代文壇上所可效法的事嗎？</p>
<p>來了，筆者更有一事可以提及的。后來王安石死了，朝議贈太傅，蘇軾撰勅文，很是稱頒他的盛德。如說他「網羅六經之遺文，斷以已意；糠粃百家之陳跡，作新斯人。屬熙之寧之有爲，冠羣賢而有用，信任之馬，古今所無。方需功業之成，遞起由　之興；浮雲何有，脫展如遺；屢爭席於漁樵，不亂羣於麋鹿；進退之際，　容可觀」。這稱頌的如何得體！陳善的們風新語上說此勅爲蘇軾宿憾之言，實是戴了著色眼鏡之議論。我們讀了這段勅文，看看現在的文壇，該會有不少的感想：真個政治關係重於友情，又真個古今人不相及嗎？</p>
<h3>藝術術語誌</h3>
<p>— 馬超英</p>
<p>如始藝術</p>
<p>英語爲Primitive　Art。是原始時代發生的藝術。對自然的驚佈和疑異，對上帝的畏懼和讚仰，由上面這種心境所產生的藝術即原始藝術。又，實用功利的藝利，大抵都有幼稚，拙劣，單純的種種特徵，也稱原始藝術。</p>
<p>造形藝術</p>
<p>英語爲Bildende　Kunst。專指繪畫，雕刻，建築和觸官的藝術。這是和詩文，音樂，舞蹈等音律的藝術的，是相對的名稱。這形美術特色有三點：　採用有形的材料，　佔有空間的或一點，　與視覺官能可發生交涉的。同時，造形和形象藝術（Bildkunst），空間藝術(Art　03　Space）兩種都有差別，前者專指繪畫與雕刻，后者則係裝飾等。</p>

<p>— 葉勁風</p>
<p>明天！一一七月廿七日。頭天晚上空整晚直到天亮，日陣砲聲，未曾稍有間斷，僅僅有時稍稍疏落，但不多一時，即又加緊轟擊。從各電臺交換的消息，知道這種動作，完全是松井幾個人的私見，大概想籍這種砲火的恫喝，屈服宋哲元，要他簽訂撤兵協定；如此，日方駐平的特工和軍事領首們，就可將功折罷了。</p>
<p>無奈宋氏這時被北平宛平幾位高級軍政長官擒住，同時也覺得日人太不給他面子，強逼他簽字撤兵，太有些「城下之盟」的意味，所以也想抗拒日軍了。</p>
<p>這天黎明，大約六點鐘左右，日方砲火，忽地靜止下來。據Ｗ君的消息，稱日方派了最后一次的聯絡員，來要求跟宋氏本人當面談話，不管贊成或拒絕，只要他親口一句話。這，當然又被拒絕了。據瀋　參謀總部的消息，才知道這一次最后的使節接觸，乃是總部的命令；松井等如再不照辦的話，必遭嚴重處置。松井這東西，何等狡猾，當然陽奉陰違，僅僅派了兩個三四等的副官隨員之類，跑到進德社行轅，處晃了幾晃，轉身便走，回到辦事處，就說「華方正式拒絕了。」松井于是據此呈報。</p>
<p>這個「呈報」剛用密碼發送，砲火又響了起來。緊接，十二架飛機分四組起飛，就在北平城郊，宛平左近，濫拋炸彈。他這既非戰略轟炸，也不是陣地轟炸，如要給他定種名目，大概可以說是「恐怖轟炸」；因爲炸彈拋得太無目標，炸燬的多半是廟宇；學校；住宅；炸死的十有九個是無辜平民。轟炸之后，又加掃射，掃射之后，又是轟炸，直到炸彈和了彈弄光，才退回去。被炸的所在，祇　下一堆瓦礫火燼，和血肉狼籍的殘肢碎骨。一片喚子覓爺聲，實在慘痛悽厲。</p>
<p>這一天，平，宛，區的人民，就在大砲飛機的恐怖下，揑著性命度過。最奇怪的一點，這一天儘管這等天翻地覆的鬧，倭軍卻始終守在自己陣地上，一步也不進攻，我方因未得到攻擊令，當然也不進攻，祇十砲裏選他一二下，略略周旋而已。晚上，卻比較平靜。也許這就是巨風暴雨前奏的片刻寧靜。</p>
<p>在電訊頻繁之下，我在上午和傍晚，到鼎元那里去過兩次。因爲全晚的砲火震地，他又失眠了一夜，直到清早，才睡了兩三個鐘頭，白　日機肆虐，呌他心神不甯，精神方面，便有些不及昨天了。我告訴他們，晚上我已經同Ｗ君在電話裏說起長幸店的情形，又把他們一家　參加軍隊工作的問題說明。W君極表同意，答應立即進行。</p>
<p>據Ｗ君的意見，這件事，似乎不成問題，隨時可以參加；那就是說，他們一家，何時準備好了，就可以投效，甚至就近加入宛平守軍　星文團部，暫時工作，也是辦法。但鼎元的意見，認爲必須首先認定一個軍團，辦理正式委聘手續，一規一矩，正式參加。這是種英國紳士作風的積習在作梗。我們兩次見面，都把這個問題，當作談話的焦點。</p>
<h3>記蜀中山水畫</h3>
<p>— 趙景深</p>
<p>我是四川宜賓人，卻不曾到過四川。前年到后方去，已經到了安徽立煌，頗想從河南陜西入川，不料平漢路斷，仍舊沒有去成，不能到我的祖先所在地去看看。但是，這兩天卻給了我一個補償，那就是全　甫和五英保的國預展覽會。</p>
<p>湊巧伍光先生也到過我們宜賓，還留下痕跡：「宜賓江中道士觀即景」和「宜賓鴿子屋」。前一幅兩山之間有水流通過，據說水很急，與江水匯合，激成湍流，沖盪在石塊之間，迴旋流走，顯出伍先生覽水的特長。他所畫的水流與一般不同，可說是他獨創一格。後一由在高山之中，有兩尊佛像，塑在岩中。山下水流亦急，有三個般老大（就是葉圣陶所說的　夫子）正在努力撐一只帆船我被畫鉤勒一個輪廓，留作紀念。</p>
<p>我議范成大的峨嵋山遊記，寫雲景是那樣地令我神往，恨不能親自去賞　那樣的境界。現在我看到伍先生的（峨山鑫頂雲色」，方知范成大所描寫者爲不虛。那樣莽莽蒼蒼的景色，的確偉大而且雄渾，但先生的筆力足以副之。</p>
<p>伍先生的畫擬石濤者甚多，他最喜歡這位苦瓜老人的山水畫。此外臨宋徵宗。米願。陸包山。金冬心的也不少。但他繤寫諸家，卻能不爲諸家所拘，伍先生到底還是伍先生。有時他也大膽地衝破國畫的傳統型範，在絕尾畫船或人，都只畫一半，像這樣腰截的辦法，古人或許要引以爲忌的。（「峽船」與「大峨接引殿」他又不惜在「嘉陵曉泛」上添山影。他那樣特殊的畫水法尤其是他的得意之筆，他把水畫活了！</p>
<p>伍先生的畫使我留下深刻的印象，在我個人的感覺上認爲最佳作的還是以下諸幅「溪山秋色」和「大峨雲色」都工緻秀逸。「淵明逸致」畫陶潛幹酒，侍者掖著他，那侍者畫得最好，兩眼直瞪，好像很吃力的樣子。我看過商務版倫敦展覽會的書畫照片，周元素的原本侍都的臉都不曾全露。遠不及伍先生這一張。「春山瑞松」稀疏有致，頗有圖案畫風味。「蜀山行旅」和「貴陽花雞靈山」都是寫實的佳作。前者繪崇山峻嶺，高蔽天日，后者寫靈山景色，令人留戀。還有一幅「師清湘青綠山水」，蔭　小舟和亂山色彩晦暗，使我聯想到那一次杭州西溪的歸掉。我對謠甫說：「這一幅可說是黃昏的景色吧？像monet畫草囤似的，我們不忍稱光明的山色爲白天，晦暗的山色爲黃昏，你看怎樣？」他也漫然點著。我不管他同意與否，總之我已經自得其樂地欣賞過了。</p>
<p>王英保先生的畫白色力似不及謠甫，但他比謠甫更傾向于工細一方面。他的畫面也常較謠甫爲小，有時狹長條或狹橫幅卻也別有風趣。一般欣賞者特別欣賞他的瀑布，定他畫的全都定的是瀑布。畫上他也題詩，但畫題也是詩的摘句，這樣一來，除去使我們知道他是畫於重慶張園或禾香草堂以外，空間他畫的是什么地方，卻使我們什么也不知道，反不如染鼎銘注明巫同峽什么的令人感到興趣。我猜想，他大約還是寫意的比寫實的多，構圖許比謠甫更完整，但實感或顯著的個性似乎也比較的少。但他不使我這外行完全失望，因爲他曾明注出一幅擬張大千的青城山；我的目的大約是特別注重蜀山某些特殊的山水，如謠甫的大佛岩之類。從前宗少臥遊五嶽，感謝伍光五二先生，現在我可以說是「立遊」蜀中山水了。</p>

<h3>白色罪犯</h3>
<p>— 少夫</p>
<p>現在有人將專門乘白車看白戲的朋友稱做白色罪犯，這個名詞倒頗雅緻。據說，在福州，當局爲了整飭社會風紀，曾經大規模地動負了軍警憲一次，搜捕了這批白色人物男男女女一百多人，處罰的辦法，是用幾輛大卡車，在傍晚的時候，再請他們整批地乘白車一次，把他們送到六十里外的郊區放生，讓他們跑步回城·那一晚正是大風大雨，據說這批脚色哭哭啼帝走了一夜扌回到城裏來。</p>
<p>想想當時的情景的確是一種可笑的滑稽塲面！這一處罰的方法，不知是那一仗幽默大師想出來的，憑心說，十分風趣。</p>
<p>我常常想，中國有許多行政上的處分，充滿了人情味，像對付這些乘白車看白戲的朋友的辦法就是其例之一，這一辦法，有人說未免謔而且虐，其實是非常有趣的！</p>
<p>上海乘白車看白戲的白色朋友也不在少數，恐怕當局還沒有想出一個較妥善的辦，法福州的用大卡車送到郊外放生辦法，似乎可以仿效，不過最好放生到浦東去，讓他們過一道黃浦江，看看悠悠之水，然而這樣一來，水陸　陳，也未免工程浩大矣。</p>
<p>新聞資料</p>
<h3>羚羊人及其他</h3>
<p>— 彌山</p>
<p>近在外的但沙漠中發現的「羚羊人」，成爲各報絕好的花邊新聞資料。所謂「羚羊人」，他的特點是：第一，行動鳴聲，無一不似羚羊，只食靑草，不吃普通食物，但是却明明是「人」；第二，跑得極快，每小時能跑五十哩，比世界百碼短跑最高紀綠，還超過二倍半，但是這位「羚羊人」還只有十五歲。</p>
<p>這新聞傳播以後，全世界人士認爲非常有趣，自然學家及醫學家也遇到了空前的難題目，英國人士說「希望能促使他出席下屆的世界運動會。」</p>
<p>若干年前，在蘇門答臘的「洛干」屬地方，也曾經發現過一種似人似猴的動物，當地土人稱他做「姑曼一·高度只有一米突左右，雙目烱烱，健步如飛，遇見人立即逃逸，頃刻間不知去向。生活狀况，完全和猿猴一模一樣，但是生理形態，却明明是入類。據常地的土人們說，在該島「牙邀」屬的森林中，這種「姑曼」爲數不少，森林旁土人居所前曝　的食物，常被他們偸走。假如照現在「羚羊人」的稱呼而推斷，那種人正可稱做「猿猴人」。</p>
<p>「羚羊人」及「猿猴人」，都是因爲自小生活在動物羣中，影響了他們的生活行動，由於生理上的特殊或變態，而形成奇奇怪怪的「特種人物」。這裏順便寫下　：一</p>

<h3>從坦克發明人逝世　談到戰車的誕生</h3>
<p>— 錦霞</p>
<p>據倫敦電，發明坦克車的特里東爵士（因發明有功，早由英皇室封爲爵士），在本月二十四日逝於林肯市的家內，享年七十一歲，屈指一算，他發明坦克車時，恰好是四十歲。對於他個人的「功績」，我們不便說些什麽；因爲所發明的是戰爭利器。這里僅爲讀者們介紹一些關於坦克誕生的故事，那是很有趣的常　。</p>
<p>遠在十五世紀，默洲文藝復興時代，有一個藝術家，李奧納多·芬琪，他在一篇文字中寫下他的幻想：「我正着手設計一種混身鐵甲，堅牢不破的戰車；當駕駛着它，開槍放砲衝入敵陣，無論如何强大的敵軍，都得潰退，而且隨在它背後的步兵，可以安全地長驅直進。」當時，在李氏木意，不過是文人的在想，却不料他成爲一個最準確的預言家：他把四百三十幾年以後出世的，陸上最偉大的武器底功能結構，一語道破。</p>
<p>狂人妄語</p>
<p>一九一一年至一九一四年，英國有幾位工程師，曾將一些一近似坦克車的計劃畫呈送陸軍部；目前這些文件仍存留在英國陸軍部的檔卷中，上面加上「此乃狂人妄語！」的批句。</p>
<p>第一次歐戰發生，協約國軍隊和德軍在法境的松末河畔相持不下，戰綫雖然延長到北海以西，但是德軍防守堅固，協的軍無法突破。當時英國派赴法國總司令部担任觀戰官的是史文登上校。他認爲：要想打開陣地戰的僵局，必須利用一種能够不畏槍彈而可以跨越壕溝，上面還有快槍裝備的戰車；他在一九一四年十月回國，把這個意見向總司令部提出，這份提案給當時的海軍部長邱吉爾看到，特加以贊助。次年，英國軍政部和海軍部合組聯合委員會，進行硏究，，九月十九日在林肯地方舉行模型展覽，委員會所製的模型，設計與原定的不盡相同，史文登認爲失敗；後來將特里東（Triton）和他的助手威爾遜上尉所特別設計的互型木質模型，加以試騐，完全適合實際條件；（一）能爬過五尺高的障碍物，（二）能衝越八尺闊的壕溝。於是英國當局便決定依照　模型建造。</p>
<p>秘密試騐</p>
<p>一九一六年夏，曾在英國本土將這種新武器加以秘密試騐。同年九月十五日淸晨，便用於法國索謨地方作戰，德軍乍見這種龐然怪物，驚潰敗退。</p>
<p>至於一坦克」侖名的由來，却是英國當局爲了避人耳目，把建造完成的新武器放入箱中封固，外面標着「坦克」（Tank即「水漕」的意思。）使人不致生疑。</p>
<p>德軍本來是沒有戰車的，但在一九一七年五月，已經仿製成功，和協的軍對抗。</p>
<p>初期的坦克車，缺點很多，軍事家曾加以批評，說坦克車有三種疾病：「跛，啞，瞎。」因爲當時坦克速率每小時三·四英里，又無電訊聯絡，展望孔狹窄。但是當它在二次大戰出現時，威力大增，成爲陸上霸王，速率增至每小時三十英里，有無綫電聯絡指揮，種類也有：水陸兩用，噴火，輕型，中型，巨型坦克等等的分別。</p>
<p>目前雖到了原子的時代，但在陸地戰役中，戰車仍然是重要的武器。</p>
<p>新聞人物</p>
<h3>老牌抗日將軍馬占山</h3>
<p>— 崇楨</p>
<p>馬占山將軍，是中國第一個的抗日將領，遠在十四年肖·他站在冰天雪地的嫩江橋畔，大胆地向日寇發射出第一粒「抵抗」的子彈。這位現已六十二歲的老將領，從那時起，直至現在止，他一直沒有離開抗日的崗位。抗戰人年中，他坐鎭陜晋綏三省夾縫中的哈拉寨，與頑强的日寇掙扎；然而，這些年來，他好似在風沙裏被埋沒着，許多人關懷他，許多人又健忘了他。日前，報上忽又發現了他調任新職。現在，他已是東北保安副司令長官了。</p>
<p>生長在農家</p>
<p>回溯到他的誕生：那是在一八八五年在遼密懷德縣一個農夫的家裏，他誕生了。幼時的他，好習拳術，頗富英雄思想，十三歲時，他就能雙手開槍，十發九中，同時並精於騎術·這也是環境培植了他成爲這樣一個尙武的人物。他事母至孝，數十年如一日。母偶病，必親自服侍。交友眞擎坦白，遇他人落難，必盡力援助，尤以陌生者向他乞援，更分外慷慨，故將軍歷任要職數十載，依然窮得可以。</p>
<p>在數十年來的軍旅生涯中，他始終抱着泰公守法，復仇雪恥的精神，從事艱巨的抗日工作。抗戰中，一般人對他往往有一種傳奇式的神話，又說他消逝了，又說他在搏鬥中，其實，他始終就是那麼樣。</p>
<p>蘆溝橋戰事爆發，他即刻到南京請示，晋謁蔣委員長，當時他被任命爲東北挺進軍總司令。是年十月中旬，他的部隊在半成熟的狀態中，參加了保衛歸綏的處女戰。他用盡了心機爲國家效勞。後來，雖被迫後退，但他自己確是最後退出的一個。他坐了最後一列車離開了歸綏。接着，在敵人冬季的掃蕩中，他又率部奮力轉戰南北，建立奇功。甘八年，他又曾想率部東征，打回黑龍江，在極艱難的情形下，他衝到了熱河西部邊境，可是，在順利的進展中，又處處遭遇到複雜環境的包圍與打擊。他好似被束縛着。卌二年二三·二六」伊盟事變中，他　靜地守着一坐空城，終於未使敵人得逞，而轉危爲安，保護了那個偉大城池。</p>
<p>壯志與雄心</p>
<p>他常自己默默地想：「我可以率領健兒衝過察北草原，直搗黑龍江，每一個角落燃起火！」然而，這理想未成事實，他那一顆壯志雄心，只好在心靈的深處潛伏着，等待着那麽一天，打回東北去。終於，抗戰勝利了，馬將軍含笑地向東北瞭望，可是東北又遭受了國際的「刦收」以及被第三者燃着了的內爭烽火。這使馬將軍太失望了！</p>
<p>勝利以後，他曾願意將十四個游擊隊編成爲兩個師（的兩萬人）的武力，一手交給國家。因爲他自己老了，應該退休，讓年靑人及後起之秀的軍官們去担負新的工作。但是目今的情勢，又使他不能退休。</p>
<p>馬將軍雖已是六十開外的老將，但還不斷地在學習，他每天總要看很多的書，尤其是報上最重要的新聞。他喜歡講話，口扌勝過筆桿，當他談風健吒的時候，便會抽起烟捲來，這是他最起勁的鏡頭。</p>
<p>今日，他被調任東北保安副司令長官，東北的人民眼看到這位老將重返東北時，猶如一個多年不見的老鄕長回到故鄉了。他們的心是聖潔的。我相信，全中國的同胞，也一定都　切着這位老將。</p>
<p>由東北問題，想到了馬占山將軍，由馬占山將軍又想到這百孔千瘡的東方巴爾幹——，令人感　萬端！</p>

        <h1>1946.09.28</h1>
<h3>Large Forces Gather on the Songhua River Line; Northeast Communist Army Issues Mobilization Order; Offensive Launched in the Jitao Road Area</h3>
<p>"Our Peiping Dispatch, 27th" Large forces from both sides are gathering on the Songhua River line. War is brewing actively in the Northeast. The Communist Party's "Democratic United Army" has issued a mobilization order, though the Communist side explains that this is for defensive purposes.</p>
<p>"Our Shenyang Dispatch, 26th" It is learned that the Communist army on the north bank of the Songhua River is actively preparing. The Nationalist army outposts north of Yongji are located at Daolajie on the north bank of the Songhua River. Communist forces are located ten li northwest of that street. On the Layen line from Shulan to Harbin, Communist forces are busy drilling and placing explosive holes in various bridges, preparing for demolition. The Communist army headquarters in Harbin has moved to Qiqihar. Harbin is currently using local circulation coupons from the Northeast Bank and puppet Manchukuo banknotes, as well as ten-yuan military scrip. Prices are gradually rising, and recently there have been many killings of former puppet Manchukuo officials and Japanese people.</p>
<p>"Our Peiping Dispatch, 27th" The Northeast Communist army launched an offensive on the Jitao Road. Lin Biao's troops, numbering over ten thousand, are currently twenty-odd li from Nong'an, appearing poised to attack Nong'an. On the anti-French front, the Communist army has destroyed the iron bridge between Lafa and the river, and the executive team has moved west to Laoye Ridge.</p>
<p>"Our Changchun Dispatch, 27th" Halahai, a stronghold on the Changbai Line, was previously captured by the Communist army but was subsequently recovered by the Nationalist army on the 25th.</p>
<p>"Our Peiping Dispatch, 26th" The Northeast Headquarters, currently in Shenyang, will move to Weichun in a month. The reason for the move is that the Nationalist army's recovered areas are gradually expanding and solidifying. There may also be new developments in northern Manchuria soon. The Headquarters feels it is difficult to direct the overall situation from Shenyang, hence the move north.</p>
<p>"Our Changchun Dispatch, 26th" Liang Huasheng came to Changchun yesterday. This afternoon, he inspected the Changchun police force at Jinshan Park. At noon, he hosted a banquet for Changchun gentry and heads of various institutions. He stated to reporters that the purpose of this trip was to inspect the civilian population's real situation, hoping to discover the people's...</p>
<p>"Our Changchun Dispatch, 26th" Major General Deng Weiren, the Director of the Military Affairs Commission's Changchun Forward Branch and concurrently the Director of Government Affairs, is scheduled to come to Changchun on the 27th to take office. Part of the new personnel for the branch will also come with Deng. The former Director, Major General Cai Zonggu, is still in Changchun. Part of the staff who resigned with him are scheduled to fly to Peiping on the 28th. Cai may leave Changchun later. Major General Wu Xingding, Director of the Government Mediation Office who visited Harbin, returned from Harbin a few days ago. He had originally planned to visit Qiqihar after Harbin, but it did not happen due to certain reasons.</p>
<h3>Northeast Transportation Urgently Seeks Improvement</h3>
<p>[Our Shenyang Dispatch, 27th] Northeast railway transportation is actively seeking ways to improve. The through train between Peiping and Shenyang, including an overnight stay in Jinzhou, takes a total of one and a half days. The heavy oil express train between Shenyang and Changchun can arrive in eight hours, which is quite convenient for people. Currently, the Shenyang Railway Bureau manages the Yingkou, Haicheng, Anshan, and Shenyang lines. Bridges that were previously destroyed on various lines were all temporary structures. Currently, the Shenyang-Hailong line is beginning to construct permanent bridges with cement and steel. The Liaoyang-Gongyuan line has also begun permanent bridge construction. Thirty-eight bridges were destroyed on the Shenyang-Andong line and between Sujiatun and Benxi, and plans are being made to repair them. However, the double tracks will be dismantled to single tracks to cope with the current difficulties. According to the person in charge of the bureau, the projects that have already begun can be completed this winter.</p>
<h3>Large Numbers of Communist Troops Discovered on the Pinggu Line; The Pingsui Line Remains Quiet; Zhangjiakou Airport Confirmed to Be Damaged</h3>
<p>"Our Peiping Dispatch, 27th" There has still been no report of battles from eastern Chahar. Tonight, vehicles continue to depart from Peiping for Nankou on the Pingsui Railway. Reconnaissance and bombing aircraft frequently fly over Peiping. Summarizing the situation from all sides, the maintenance of the quiet state is indeed approaching its final stage. It is heard that the Communist army in eastern Chahar has already manufactured a large number of military uniforms identical to those of the Nationalist army. The Nationalist army has other countermeasures for this. It is also learned that the headquarters of the 94th Army will leave Tianjin and transfer to Chahar. All sectors of Tianjin are preparing to see them off. The transfer of the 16th Army seems to follow the same route.</p>
<p>"Our Peiping Dispatch, 27th" The Nationalist army's advance on Zhangjiakou has been hampered by the sudden discovery of large numbers of Communist troops on the Pinggu Line, which has prevented the concentration of attacking forces on the front of the Pingsui Line as scheduled. It is learned that on the 24th and 25th, six regiments of Communist troops were suddenly discovered at Yangge, thirty li east of Shunyi on the Pinggu Line. Three regiments of Communist troops were also discovered between Niulan and Baimiao Village north of Shunyi. The military authorities have dispatched crack troops from Tianjin to suppress them, which has prevented the advance on Zhangjiakou from being launched as scheduled. Officials revealed that the Pingsui Line front remains quiet today. The occupiers of Kangzhuang are the original garrison troops stationed at Qinglong Bridge.</p>
<p>"Our Peiping Dispatch, 26th" It is widely rumored here that the Nationalist army will launch an eight-pronged attack on Zhangyuan. On the Hebei-Chahar border, one route will advance northwest along the Pingsui Railway from Kangzhuang and Huailai, which will be the main force. Another route will advance towards Xuanhua via Chicheng and Dushikou. The Communist army is fleeing towards eastern Hebei. One route will advance from Zhaizhang along the mountains towards Zhuolu, towards the Suiyuan-Chahar border. One route will advance along the railway line through Yanggao and Tianzhen to attack Chaigoubao. One route will advance from Zhanggao Baijiayingzi towards Chaigoubao. One route will move from Xinghe Shangyi towards Zhangbei in the Rehe-Chahar border area. One route will move from Longhua Weichang towards Duolun. One route will advance from Linxi towards Duolun Guyuan. The Communist army seems to have decided to adopt a scorched earth policy and has ordered able-bodied men and women within fifteen kilometers along the Pingsui Railway to leave their original locations and concentrate at designated locations.</p>
<p>[Our Peiping Dispatch, 27th] It is learned that the Zhangyuan airport has indeed been destroyed again, leaving only a short runway with obstacles that can be temporarily removed. Zhangyuan has been tense since the 20th. All military vehicles have been requisitioned to transport supplies. Non-essential schools, factories, and hospitals have been evacuated. Young men wearing red flowers as "Honorary Enlisted Soldiers" can be seen on the streets. There are daily air raid alarms, but few people are fleeing.</p>
<h3>Rumor of Fu Zuoyi's Return to Suiyuan</h3>
<p>Communist Troops Outside Datong Collapse</p>
<p>"Central News Agency, Taiyuan, 26th" General Fu Zuoyi flew from Peiping to Datong on the morning of the 24th to pay respects to the spirits of the fallen soldiers and to visit injured officers and soldiers in various hospitals, rewarding all wounded and defending officers and soldiers with 15 million yuan. He left Datong around 4:00 PM and flew back to Suiyuan.</p>
<p>[Our Peiping Dispatch, 27th] Nationalist troops in Datong launched an offensive on the 24th and recovered the Pingwang Power Plant. On the 25th, they recovered Kouquan. Chu Xichun revisited and inspected the power plant and mining area on the 25th. Some of the machinery at both locations was taken away by the Communist army, and some was destroyed, leaving only a field of rubble.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Datong, 27th] The Communist forces outside Datong have collapsed and are fleeing in all directions.</p>
<h3>Nationalist and Communist Armies on the Peiping-Hankou Railway</h3>
<p>Hold Each Other in Check Between Fengle and Cixian</p>
<p>"Our Tianjin Dispatch, 27th" In the central section of the Peiping-Hankou Railway, Liu Bocheng's Communist forces, numbering over 50,000, are currently holding their ground against the Nationalist army moving north in the Shuiyezhen area between Fengle and Cixian. Several regiments of Communist troops have been arriving in Yuanshi territory for days. The telephone lines between Yuanshi and Douyu have been completely destroyed.</p>

<h3>Nine Strange Aircraft Land in the Communist-Controlled Area of Mancheng</h3>
<p>[Our Peiping Dispatch, 27th] According to a report received by the garrison headquarters here from a Baoding telephone call, nine aircraft of unknown origin landed yesterday in the suburbs of Mancheng, east of Baoding, which is under Communist control.</p>
<h3>Nationalist Army in Northern Jiangsu Presses Towards Shuyang; Wang Yaowu Arrives in Xuzhou to Report to Xue Yue; Communist Army in Southern Shandong Gathers, Attempting to Make Trouble</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 27th] The Nationalist army is pressing close to Shuyang and is currently engaged in fierce fighting.</p>
<p>[Our Taixian Dispatch, 26th] The Communist Suwan Border Region Government has moved from Huaiyin, which was recovered by the Nationalist army, to Louxiazhuang. The place is under the jurisdiction of Yancheng, located more than seventy li west of Yancheng. There is an independent Communist brigade with Japanese equipment, numbering about two thousand, on guard within a radius of fifteen li around the area. Nearby rivers have also been filled in to prohibit passage.</p>
<p>[Our Xuzhou Dispatch, 27th] General Wang Yaowu, Commander of the Second Pacification Zone, flew from Jinan to Xuzhou on a special plane at 10:45 AM on the 27th to report to Director Xue and seek instructions.</p>

<h3>The United States Has No Intention of Withdrawing Its Troops Stationed in China;</h3>
<p>It Is Believed That Stalin's Statements Are a Diplomatic Tactic</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] Washington, 27th Radio Broadcast: Officials in Washington stated that the US government has no intention of withdrawing its troops from China at this time. Well-informed sources believe that Stalin's opposition to the stationing of US troops in China is merely a diplomatic tactic aimed at diverting the world's attention in order to conceal the Soviet Union's actions in Eastern Europe, rather than truly forcing the United States to withdraw from the Far East. Although the US government has kept the strength of US troops stationed in China a secret, officials openly acknowledge that there are only three to four thousand US Army personnel stationed in China, approximately twenty-two thousand Marines, and very few Navy personnel, totaling no more than twenty-five thousand. Unless there are unexpected developments, US troops will continue to be stationed in China until the work of maintaining order and mediating the Chinese civil war is completed. Government officials expressed the opinion that if the US Marines were to withdraw, the Communist army would cut off railway transportation lines and block the source of coal needed by industries in the Shanghai and Guangdong areas. They firmly believe that chaos would immediately break out throughout China after the US military withdrew. When asked if the US military was assisting the Nationalist army in engaging in the civil war, they replied, "The US military stationed in China maintains an absolutely neutral position," and emphasized that the US military no longer airlifts Chinese government troops, nor does it provide them with food and military supplies.</p>
<h3>Wu Tiecheng Criticizes Gromyko's Speech</h3>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 27th] Wu Tiecheng, Secretary-General of the Central Party Headquarters, met with reporters today and criticized Soviet representative Gromyko's recent accusations in the Security Council, saying, "The stationing of US troops in China will not endanger world peace; on the contrary, it is conducive to promoting world peace. In my opinion, it is the stationing of foreign troops in a country's territory without the permission of that country's government that endangers world peace." Although he did not explicitly state it, he was clearly referring to the Soviet troops who are continuing to remain in certain locations in the Northeast in violation of treaty provisions. Wu stated, "The so-called 'Withdrawal from China Week' movement was initiated by a small number of pro-Communist elements in Shanghai and is merely a mouthpiece for Yan'an." He emphasized, "The US military has sacrificed its material comfort to come to China and continues to fulfill its important mission as an allied nation. We value the US military's past and future actions equally."</p>
<h3>The Chairman Receives US and British Ambassadors; Foreign Minister Wang Reports on the International Situation; Ambassador Stuart's Letter to Zhou Enlai Has Been Delivered to Shanghai</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 27th] The atmosphere for political negotiations in the capital has become more intense due to the Chairman's return to Nanjing, but Zhou Enlai is still in Shanghai, so there has been no significant progress. Yesterday, Special Envoy Marshall and Ambassador Stuart jointly sent a letter to Zhou Enlai. It is said that the contents are simple, expressing a deep hope that Zhou will return to Nanjing as soon as possible to discuss the overall situation of peace. This letter was sent by a special person dispatched by the Communist delegation on the night train of the 26th to Shanghai to be handed over to Zhou. Some people believe that there must be a clear reply to this letter as to whether the Communist Party will adhere to its prejudices, or have other opinions. Marshall visited Chairman Chiang at the official residence on Huangpu Road at 11:00 AM on the 27th for forty minutes. In the afternoon, at 5:30 PM, Ambassador Stuart, along with his personal advisor Chuan Jingbo, also visited the Chairman, leaving at 6:10 PM. The content of the talks all described the contact situation of the peace negotiations. It is heard that the current situation still focuses on the Communist Party's attitude, because the government's attitude of starting to solve the problem from a political perspective follows the advice of the mediator Ambassador Stuart, and was agreed to by the Communist Party, however, suddenly it reversed, I am afraid that before the three-person meeting is convened, the Communist Party will have new actions. Observers also believe that the Nationalists and Communists disputes must be resolved through political channels; not resolving the fundamental problem and talking about other things is putting the cart before the horse. Also, at 4:00 PM, Fu Jingbo visited Wu Dingchang and generally discussed the current situation.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 27th] Ambassador Stuart had a one-hour meeting with the visiting Australian Ambassador on the 27th at 10 AM, and also held a tea party at his residence in the afternoon at 5:00 PM, to entertain American personnel in the churches, and invited Special Envoy Marshall to participate. The Ambassador was very interested in the church personnel. He will host a banquet at noon on the 28th for Bishop Yu Bin, who arrived in Nanjing from Hankou today, the Minister of National Defense Bai Chongxi, Foreign Minister Wang Shijie, and Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan Jiang Menglin. All of this is enough to show that the peace negotiations, which have been depressed for many days, are turning active.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Nanjing, 27th] Communist spokesman Wang Bingnan said that he received a letter from Ambassador Stuart yesterday, which has been forwarded to Shanghai for Zhou Enlai to read. A reply is expected today or tomorrow. Zhou's return to Nanjing and investigation depend on the results of the talks between Marshall and Chairman Chiang. The Communist Party still insists on restoring the Military Three-Person Group Meeting to discuss a comprehensive ceasefire; the Five-Person Group Meeting is not necessary.</p>
<p>[French News Agency, Nanjing, 27th] Chairman Chiang received Foreign Minister Wang Shijie on the 27th, keeping him for lunch. It is heard that Foreign Minister Wang reported to the Chairman on the participation in the Paris Peace Conference and the international situation.</p>
<h3>The Legislative Spirit of the May 5th Draft Constitution is Based on the Theory of the Five-Power Constitution;</h3>
<p>The Revised Draft Reviewed by the Political Consultative Conference Still Needs Ratification</p>
<p>Wu Jingxiong's Talk</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, City Report] The National Assembly, which is attracting national attention, will open on November 12th. The main mission of the conference is to formulate and promulgate a constitution and implement constitutional government. The May 5th Draft Constitution, which was previously passed by the Legislative Yuan in three readings, will be submitted to the conference for discussion as the basis for generating a complete Constitution of the Republic of China. In order to understand the legislative spirit of the May 5th Draft Constitution and the comprehensive opinions of various parties, the reporter specifically visited Dr. Wu Luoneng, former Vice Chairman of the Constitution Drafting Committee of the Legislative Yuan, yesterday to inquire about its content. He said: In order to make the country's politics enter the normal track of modernization, we must not ignore the importance of the constitutional period, but the prerequisite for implementing constitutional government must be a good constitution. In recent years, the government has attached great importance to the preparation work for the constitution. Under the main leadership of President Sun of the Legislative Yuan, after extensive consultation and consideration of the national conditions, after a long period of consideration, the procedure for the three readings produced a draft constitution of the Republic of China promulgated on May 5, referred to as the "May 5th Constitution". The basic spirit of the draft constitution emphasizes two points. (1) Based on the theory of the Five-Power Constitution. (2) Adopt the strengths of various democratic countries. Wu also said: The politics of Western countries are either biased towards the people having "power" and the government falling into a state of "inability", or the government has "ability" and the people lack "power." Therefore, the Founder of the Nation, Dr. Sun Yat-sen, placed special emphasis on the people having "power" and the government having "ability" in his Zhang Constitution. This is the latest and most valuable contribution to the theory of the constitution in democratic countries. The May 5th Draft Constitution is formulated based on this spirit. Recently, before the American legal authority Pound returned to the country, I had several studies with him on the May 5th Draft Constitution, and he was very satisfied with the draft constitution as a whole, especially the point that China implemented the presidential system, which he greatly appreciated. He once stated that the cabinet system does not seem to be applicable to China, because among the Western countries, the one that has been most successful in implementing the cabinet system is only the United Kingdom, but its main background is that the British people have undergone a hundred years of training in constitutional government and have developed the habit of constitutional government. The Chinese people cannot be compared with the British in this respect; he believes that if the May 5th Draft Constitution can be passed, China will become a very modern democratic country, and at the same time he believes that constitutional government focuses on implementation and cannot haggle over the wording, but only on whether it is suitable for the situation of the country. As for my opinion, the May 5th Draft Constitution is not unchangeable, but if there is any change, it must not depart from the theory of the Five-Power Constitution, which is the crystallization of the Founder of the Nation's lifelong efforts and political experience. At this point, the reporter raised several questions, which Wu answered as follows:</p>
<p>(Question) What are your views on whether the powers of this National Assembly are limited to constitution-making, or whether they also include concurrent constitutional implementation?</p>
<p>(Answer) I think: (1) It is not easy to convene the National Assembly. (2) It is easier to discover the shortcomings of the constitution and facilitate amendments if the same institution makes the constitution and implements it concurrently. Therefore, I advocate that the powers of this National Assembly are best to make the constitution and implement it concurrently.</p>
<p>(Question) Is there a standing institution during the adjournment of the National Assembly?</p>
<p>(Answer) If another standing institution is established, I am afraid it will create a "supreme government" and fail to sell the theory of separation of "power" and "ability."</p>
<p>(Question) What are the views of the Political Consultative Conference's Constitution Review Committee on the May 5th Draft Constitution?</p>
<p>(Answer) The results of the committee's review are not far from the original legislative spirit of the May 5th Draft Constitution. At that time, there was an understanding among the various parties and factions that the proposed revised draft was not a final conclusion and must be ratified by the highest authorities of the various parties and factions. The most important revision was to add a chapter on "the powers of the central government and the provinces" to the draft constitution.</p>

<h3>Proposals from Councilor Yin Shuxian and Others: Exchange Rates Should Not Be Further Devalued; the Council's Standing Committee Resolved to Submit the Issue to a Subcommittee for Review; Requesting the Government to Provide Relief to Disaster-Stricken Provinces Such as Yunnan and Shanxi</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 27th] The 9th regular meeting of the Standing Committee of the Political Consultative Council was held on the morning of the 27th on the second floor of the National Assembly Hall. Attendees included Yin Shuxian and Fan Yusui, among others. Presided over by Chairman Shao Lizi, Minister of Judicial Administration Xie Guansheng reported on the latest judicial administration measures and the handling of traitor cases, stating briefly: Regarding the restoration of judicial organs, from October of last year to August of this year, a total of 275 units have relocated back to their original locations to conduct business. These include 12 High Courts, 16 High Branch Courts, 92 District Courts, and 155 Judicial Offices. Regarding the reserve of judicial personnel, a judicial personnel examination was held once last year, and 181 people were admitted. In the first examination this year, 403 people were admitted. The judicial groups of various universities can admit approximately 139 people. Currently, 190 registered judicial officials have been found qualified after review, including 102 judges and 28 military judicial personnel. Regarding the handling of traitor cases, Xie stated: As of August, 764 cases have been reportedly prosecuted, 2763 cases have not been prosecuted, 2972 cases have resulted in criminal sentences, and 879 cases have resulted in acquittals. Furthermore, regarding the investigation of war criminals, between January and June of this year, 13,983 cases have been sent to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and 1,262 defendants have been found guilty after review. Xie concluded by mentioning that the American legal scholar Pound's recent visit to China has contributed greatly. Mr. Pound is proficient in English and American law and continental law. He believes that it is very appropriate for China to adopt continental law, but it should be further adapted to national conditions. He also suggested that China's laws are not yet perfect, and the government should invite legal experts to annotate the true meaning of civil and criminal law to avoid divergent interpretations and inconsistent applications. We are currently considering this suggestion. Subsequently, the councilors questioned Xie regarding the case of He Dekui, which was previously reported by Councilor Luo Heng, leading to heated debates. Following this, the following proposals were discussed: (1) A proposal by Ren Chunwu and others requesting the government to quickly provide relief to the disaster-stricken areas of western Yunnan and reduce the amount of grain requisitioned in Yunnan Province. It was resolved to submit this proposal to the government for prompt action. (2) A proposal by Wu Zhaoxu and others stating that the disaster situation in Shanxi is serious, especially for the people of Datong and those from Shangdang who are refugees in Henan and Shaanxi, whose plight is even more tragic, requesting the government to quickly send senior officials with large sums of money and food to provide urgent relief to save the lives of the people. It was resolved to submit this proposal to the government for prompt action. (3) A proposal by Kuiyi and others stating that the living allowance standards for faculty and staff of national colleges and universities should be consistent, and the differentiated adjustment method should be abolished to alleviate the crisis in higher education. It was resolved to submit this proposal to a subcommittee for review. (4) A proposal requesting the government to quickly assist overseas Chinese victims in the Dutch East Indies. It was resolved to submit this proposal to the government for prompt action. (5) A proposal stating that rice shortages are severe in Xiamen and requesting the Ministry of Food to allocate loans to purchase and transport rice to regulate the food supply for the people. It was resolved to submit this proposal to the government for action. (6) A proposal by Xue Mingjian and others requesting the government to instruct the China Tobacco Corporation to improve the method of purchasing dried tobacco leaves. It was resolved to submit this proposal to the government for prompt action. (7) A proposal by Yin Shuxian and others stating that after the adjustment of foreign exchange rates, prices have soared and the financial market has become increasingly chaotic, and requesting the government to quickly devise appropriate measures and not further devalue exchange rates to alleviate the people's difficulties. It was resolved to submit this proposal to a subcommittee for review.</p>
<h3>Standing Committee Member of the Political Consultative Council Questions the Case of He Dekui; Minister Xie's Explanation Sparks Heated Debate</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 27th] In Minister Xie's report to the regular meeting of the Standing Committee of the Political Consultative Council, not a word was mentioned about the handling of the case of He Dekui, which was previously reported by Councilor Luo Heng. The councilors expressed dissatisfaction and questioned him one after another. Xie explained that the suspicion of treason lies in the following two points: (1) those who worked under the puppet organization, and (2) those who engaged in acts of collusion with the enemy. He Dekui's position in the Shanghai Municipal Council, an international organization, does not make it a completely puppet organization. As for whether it constitutes collusion with the enemy, it can be further studied. He also reported that the case of He Dekui was notified to the Executive Yuan by the Supreme National Defense Council, and the Executive Yuan notified the Ministry of Judicial Administration. The ministry immediately sent personnel to Shanghai to investigate and submit a report. This report has been forwarded to the Supreme National Defense Council. The Supreme National Defense Council discussed it for a long time at its last meeting, but no conclusion has been reached. Regarding the evidence presented by Councilor Luo Heng, namely the approval of the use of puppet textbooks, Xie stated: This official matter was submitted by his subordinate on June 24, while He signed it on July 27, delaying it for more than 30 days. Although this cannot be said to be sufficient to mitigate the crime, it also cannot be said to constitute collusion with the enemy (Note: At that time, He was the Director of the Education Department of the Shanghai Municipal Council, and the Japanese Okamoto was the Chairman. After the signature was established, all schools switched to using puppet textbooks). After Xie finished explaining, councilors Fan Yusui, Xu Xiaoyan, Yin Shuxian and others expressed dissatisfaction, believing that the government should not delay the handling of the case. Luo Heng then presented his views to refute it, approximately as follows: If the Shanghai Municipal Council cannot be considered a puppet organization, then what kind of institution is a puppet organization? If the Wang Jingwei government, which was controlled by the enemy and puppets, is called a puppet organization, then how can the Shanghai Municipal Council, which was controlled by the enemy and puppets, not be? Therefore, this point should be explained from a legal perspective. Secondly, after the Shanghai Municipal Council was taken over by the enemy, the government instructed the original staff to withdraw, but He did not withdraw, which clearly constitutes treasonous behavior. This matter has not been noticed by the judiciary, nor has it been reported, but it is indeed necessary to draw attention to it. Furthermore, when the government sent personnel to investigate, the case files were suddenly lost, and this should be investigated. He then stated: Whether the Shanghai Municipal Council can be called an international organization should be studied, and it should be studied from a practical perspective, not from a formal perspective. For example, the Shanghai Higher Court once handled the case of Huang Fusen, who worked in the police station. The nature of the police station is the same as that of the Shanghai Municipal Council. In the past, both were international organizations, but Huang Fusen was convicted of collusion with the enemy, while He was not. At this time, Councilor Yin Shuxian stated again that whether or not there was collusion with the enemy is not the point. The promotion of slave education is a fact and is detrimental to the nation and the people. The debate was extremely heated, and many opinions were raised. It was then decided to discuss it at the next meeting. The meeting adjourned at around 1 p.m.</p>
<h3>Super Highway to Be Built Between Nanjing and Shanghai</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 27th] The Ministry of Transportation will build a super highway (i.e., asphalt road) between Nanjing and Shanghai, and has dispatched surveying teams to various locations along the route for investigation. It is reported that the road will pass through Tangshan, Jurong, Danyang, Wujin, Wuxi, Changshu, Taicang, Jiading, Zhenru and other places.</p>
<h3>Rapid Trials of Traitors, Ordinary Cases Backlogged Everywhere</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 27th] Minister Xie of the Ministry of Judicial Administration said: The work of the courts in trying traitors is still relatively rapid, but ordinary cases are inevitably backlogged. Furthermore, the number of criminals has increased, and the court detention centers have either been damaged or are still occupied, making them even more inadequate. All of this needs to be rectified urgently.</p>
<h3>Crackdown on Occupation of Civilian Housing</h3>
<p>Wuhan Headquarters Decides on Measures</p>
<p>[Our Hankou Dispatch of the 27th] Housing disputes here are becoming increasingly serious. The Wuhan Headquarters has recently decided on two measures to gradually resolve them. On the short-term front, it will resolutely crack down on the occupation of civilian housing by troops and government agencies, and strictly order civil servants to pay rent at market prices, with no shortages or arrears. On the long-term front, it has ordered all landlords to repair the damaged houses within a limited time, and the headquarters will issue a guarantee certificate, guaranteeing that no government agency or troop will occupy them. Those who are unable to repair them can entrust them to those who have the financial resources to repair them, and they will be given the same guarantee.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou's Major Traitor Wang Wuquan's Sentence Changed to Life Imprisonment</h3>
<p>[Our Hangzhou Dispatch of the 27th] The well-known economic traitor Wang Wuquan was originally sentenced to death due to the seriousness of his crimes. Wang appealed for a retrial, which was approved. The High Court retried the case and pronounced the verdict at 10:30 this morning. The main text stated: Wang Wuquan is sentenced to life imprisonment for continuously colluding with the enemy and plotting to resist the country, providing goods and money. All of his property will be confiscated, except for the necessary living expenses for his family. Wang's face was ruddy, and he seemed happy with the verdict.</p>
<h3>Five Chinese Passengers Die in British Plane Crash in Hong Kong</h3>

<h3>Hankou's Puppet Army Commander Zou Pingfan Raids Large Quantities of Supplies; Investigation Team Releases Details and Requests Immediate Arrest</h3>
<p>[Our Hankou Dispatch of the 26th] The Xiang-E-Gan Area Investigation Team has recently released the case of Zou Pingfan, the puppet army commander, who took advantage of the enemy's surrender and the chaos in Wuhan to plunder supplies on a large scale. The main points are as follows: (1) He commanded his troops to guard all the important enemy warehouses in Wuhan and the warehouses of the enemy's Wuhan Business Association, and used trucks to transport various inventory goods to his private residence in Hanyang for concealment and private ownership. The continuous transportation lasted for ten days. (2) Taking advantage of the takeover, he stole 10,000 dan of salt stored by the enemy at the Xuanmiaoguan Temple outside the West Gate of Hanyang and transported it to the Huanglingji area of Caidian for sale. He also privately transported and sold 15,000 dan of salt stored in the Taikoo Wharf godowns. (3) On August 26 of last year, he ordered his team to transport 200 Type 38 rifles, 2,500 Type 99 rifles, 4,000 Type 38 light machine guns, more than 500 Zhongzheng rifles, and 400 boxes of pistols from the Japanese 112th warehouse (located at the Fourth Wharf) and concealed it without reporting it. (4) On September 5 of last year, Sun Mingdu's troop, the Second Special Agent Battalion of the puppet army, robbed the Japanese warehouse in Wuchang of 1,600 Type 38 rifles, 13 Type 38 heavy machine guns, 8 light machine guns, 50 grenade launchers, more than 1,000 grenades, and more than 70 various pistols. (5) He robbed 3,000 dan of rice from the Japanese 105th warehouse, and robbed more than 500 dan of rice from Yongfeng, Maoshenglu, Hengmao and other rice mills on Minzu Road. (6) He robbed the gold jewelry and clothing of Liu Lifan, the puppet mayor of Wuchang. After investigation by the Japanese Materials Management Committee of the Sixth War Area Headquarters, only a small part was recovered. Finally, the team concluded: Zou Pingfan held an important position in the puppet army under the protection of the enemy and puppets, resisted the National Army, and harmed the people. He was already guilty of heinous crimes. After the enemy army surrendered, the Central Government was magnanimous and allowed him to start anew. However, he did not reflect and continued to do evil under the guise of takeover. The value of his stolen goods and property in Wuhan amounted to hundreds of millions. If such a major criminal is not severely punished, it will be impossible to face the people and maintain order. Therefore, yesterday, based on the facts of the investigation, it has telegraphed the Wuhan Chairman's Headquarters to issue an arrest warrant for Zou Pingfan and bring him to justice. It also requested that all his property in Wuhan be sealed up first.</p>

<h3>"There Is No Place Like Home"; Overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia Suffer Economic Discrimination; Chinese Nationals in French-Viet Nam Often Affected by Fights</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Fuzhou, 27th] According to returned overseas Chinese who recently arrived here from Singapore and spoke with reporters about the situation of overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia, currently, overseas Chinese are not only being treated with hostility by the colonial rulers, but are also suffering from serious economic discrimination. As a result, Chinese communities everywhere feel that "there is no place like home" and are planning to transfer their assets back to China. However, because they are not fully aware of the current situation in China, most are watching and hesitating. Last month, overseas Chinese leaders in Singapore proposed to raise 30 billion yuan to establish the Fujian Economic Construction Company. It is generally believed that if the government can provide practical guarantees of rights and interests, then many times more funds could be raised. Overseas Chinese in Singapore still have some development in the rubber industry, and the economic situation is relatively stable. In Viet Nam, however, the Chinese are often affected by the ongoing struggles between the French and the Vietnamese. The sugar industry is subjected to harsh treatment, and the future is bleak. In the Philippines, due to the promotion of diplomatic relations between China and the Philippines, the situation of overseas Chinese is gradually improving. Currently, overseas Chinese schools there urgently need teachers, and it is hoped that the motherland will send people to go. The returned overseas Chinese also stated that the number of overseas Chinese and their economic strength are the greatest in Fujian and Guangdong. It is by no means difficult to call on them to return home to invest.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Considering the Big Picture, Not Arguing Over Trifles</h3>
<p>The peace talks between the government and the Communist Party have shown signs of renewed hope since Chairman Chiang's return to Nanjing the day before yesterday. We, the common people, eagerly hope that this atmosphere will become increasingly strong, and especially pray that it will not end merely as talk. We cherish peace and also deeply believe that the government desires peace; after nearly two months of military engagement, we imagine that today's Communist Party may also be seeking peace. Therefore, now that Chairman Chiang has returned to Nanjing and Marshal Ma has put forward a compromise solution, if both parties seize this good opportunity and do not let it slip away, then the peaceful unification of China, at this final critical juncture, should have the possibility of being realized.</p>
<p>To realize the peaceful unification of China, the most important condition, of course, lies in the sincerity of both the government and the Communist Party. However, sincerity alone is not enough; both parties must have far-sighted vision and broad-mindedness. With great vision, one can consider the big picture; with broad-mindedness, one can avoid arguing over trifles. If both parties can consider the overall situation and not be preoccupied with petty disputes, we believe that as fellow Chinese, as long as they are not willingly subservient to foreign powers, what issues cannot be discussed and must be resolved by force? In the past, perhaps the Communist Party, relying on its rebellious military strength, thought it could compete with the central government, and thus only viewed peace talks as a process of gaining time for attack, without any sincerity. But after the trials of the past two months, the Communist Party should realize that military force is not necessarily reliable, and it is better to turn back and sincerely seek a political solution. In the past, perhaps the government believed that the Communist army occupied strategic locations and blocked transportation, and the government could not allow it to secede in the name of peace talks; but now, the war in northern Jiangsu is expected to end soon, and several important strongholds have gradually been recovered. The areas from which the government originally hoped the Communist army would withdraw have seen their influence weakened, and the government may also feel that there is no need to insist on a counter-offensive. Therefore, if both parties broaden their horizons and expand their minds, reopening peace talks at this time would be the best opportunity, and it is hoped that it will yield results.</p>
<p>The reason why previous peace talks were stalled was the dispute over whether to convene a five-person group or a three-person group first; in other words, it was the dispute over whether to discuss the reorganization of the National Government first or to discuss a military ceasefire first. In fact, ceasefire orders have been issued repeatedly, and opinions on the reorganization of the National Government have been exchanged more than once, making the order of discussion meaningless. Now, the two mediators, Ma and Ssu, have suggested that the three-person group and the five-person group be convened simultaneously, and that military and political planning be considered together. This is deeply in line with the principle of moderation, and now we are only waiting for a response from the Communist Party representative, Zhou Enlai, as to whether he will return to Nanjing. There used to be a joke about the great scientist Newton, who had a big cat and a small cat at home, so he made a big hole and a small hole in the wall for them to pass through. In fact, with a big hole, couldn't the small cat also enter and exit freely? Today, arguing over a five-person group versus a three-person group for the sake of peace talks is no less ridiculous. We, the common people, have suffered enough and are tired of war. We have no mood to listen to such meaningless disputes. We sincerely ask both parties to consider the big picture and not argue over such trifles.</p>
<p>For the sake of the government, we want to advise the central figures to embody Heaven's virtue of cherishing life and the Chairman's heart of loving the people. The counter-offensive against the Communist army should be stopped when appropriate. As long as the Communist Party expresses its willingness to participate in the reorganized government and sincerely participate in the National Assembly for constitutional drafting, then the stability of the overall situation can be assured, and the happiness of the Chinese people can be expected. Everything else can be discussed calmly, and there is no need to continue mobilizing troops. For the sake of the Communist Party, we must also advise their leaders not to regard themselves as grassroots heroes in Chinese history, holding onto the outdated idea of "if you succeed, you are a king; if you fail, you are a bandit." They should broaden their horizons, learn from the style of opposition parties in democratic and advanced countries around the world, put down their guns, speak up, jump out of the battlefield, and enter the political arena. Then, even if they withdraw from a few cities and towns on the battlefield today, who knows if they will occupy more seats in the parliament in the future? Moreover, to be honest, the Communist Party should also see clearly that at present—at least in these few years—the Soviet Union is not necessarily determined to go to war with the United States, so why should they volunteer to take an anti-American stance on the Chinese battlefield first? The construction and revival of China after the war depend on the assistance of all allied nations. If we are peaceful and united internally, then any external help, whether capital or technology, can be supplied continuously, and China's future is promising. If the Communist Party does not want to be a sinner of the nation, it should not obstruct China's construction by creating war. Therefore, for the sake of the people and for the sake of both parties, we cannot help but earnestly advise both the government and the Communist Party to consider the big picture, not argue over trifles, and complete the historical task of peaceful unification.</p>
<p>Whoever can take the lead in showing that they will not argue over trifles, whoever can thoroughly show that they will consider the big picture, will win the support of the people, and will win the country.</p>

<h3>Someone is Pulling Strings Behind the Greek Civil War, Britain and the United States Decide to Adopt a Firm Stance, British Troops Will Not Withdraw to Maintain Order and Tranquility</h3>
<p>[United Press International, Washington, 26th] According to high-level sources today: The U.S. government is planning to adopt a "hard-line" policy to deal with the suspected activities of the Soviet Union in the Greek situation, and the first step may be to provide further financial and economic assistance to Greece. U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes has discussed this situation with British Foreign Secretary Bevin in Paris, and both sides have apparently agreed that the British and American governments should be absolutely firm in their position on Greece, as they are on Iran and other areas of conflicting interests. According to behind-the-scenes indications, the Communist forces in northern Greece who are stubbornly resisting the government army are receiving arms supplies from Yugoslavia and Albania. A diplomat familiar with the overall situation said that this "creeping war" in northern Greece has caused great concern in Washington, because although the direct combatants are small countries, behind them is the power struggle between major countries, which is where the danger lies. Britain and the United States believe that only by jointly adopting a "tough" stance to assist the Greek government can this conflict be controlled, otherwise the Soviet Union may expand its influence southward through Greece and gain control of the eastern Mediterranean.</p>
<p>[United Press, London, 26th] The government today stated that if the Greek army cannot suppress the Macedonian Communist rebellion, British troops may intervene in the Greek civil war. Reports that the British commander has been ordered not to participate in the Greek civil war have been denied by the Foreign Office, which emphasized that the purpose of the British troops' stay in Greece is to stabilize the government's position and maintain peace and order.</p>
<p>[United Press International, Thessaloniki, 26th] Greek troops are conducting military operations in the north. According to Greek officials, a group of rioters attacked a Greek outpost from eastern Albania through the Yugoslav border. The attackers used automatic weapons and hand grenades, but were driven back. At the same time, it is reported that the British command is reorganizing the 30,000 troops stationed there, and it is rumored that one of the two British divisions will be withdrawn from Greece. According to a London dispatch, a British Foreign Office spokesman said that the war between the government army and the left-wing rebels in northern Greece is most intense south of the Yugoslav and Albanian borders, and is expanding westward to the area south of the Bulgarian border. The British government has no intention of withdrawing its troops from Greece immediately.</p>
<p>Potentially Lead to Serious Consequences</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 26th] London observers believe that if the civil war expands to the entire country and the British troops have not yet withdrawn, the latter will inevitably be involved. Supporters of the Greek government believe that the left-wing guerrillas, with the help of southern Albania and even Bulgaria, may exceed the strength of the government army, eventually forcing the British army to intervene. Currently, the support of Greece's northern neighbors for the left-wing guerrillas is becoming increasingly obvious and active, and may eventually overwhelm the government army. The possible consequences are three: (1) British troops withdraw immediately, regardless of the fate of the Greek army; (2) Large-scale but covert foreign intervention, creating a situation similar to the Spanish Civil War; (3) British and Slavic countries aid the war, openly acknowledging it. The last of these three scenarios is the most dangerous and could ignite a widespread war.</p>
<p>Turkey Consolidates Border Defenses</p>
<p>[United Press International, Athens, 26th] According to sources in Istanbul, Turkey is taking a calm attitude towards the so-called "small-scale civil war" in northern Greece and will not take any action. Turkey has consolidated its defenses in Thrace Province, north of the Dardanelles Strait and adjacent to the Greek border. Some people doubt whether the deterioration of the Greek situation is as serious as reported, but hundreds of Turks living in Thrace Province are fleeing back to their country to avoid persecution by the Greek Communists. According to Turkish newspapers, 800 people fled back to their country three days ago, and those who could not escape are said to be being "slaughtered."</p>
<h3>Greek King Returns to Power, Communist Party Proposes Conditions for Joining Government</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 27th] Greek King George today flew from London to a Greek port, where the Greek Crown Prince and Princess arrived by destroyer from Alexandria to greet him.</p>
<p>[United Press International, Athens, 26th] The city has decided to close all businesses on Saturday morning to welcome the King. The police have announced that no one will be allowed to carry weapons at that time for security reasons. People are not allowed to move freely along the King's procession route, and residents are not allowed to watch from the rooftops or balconies within 100 yards.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper] London, 27th Broadcast: As King George II of Greece departed London to return to his country, the Greek Communist Party today proposed six conditions for ending the civil war and joining a coalition government: (1) Expanding the cabinet to include all parties and factions; (2) Requiring Britain to withdraw all troops; (3) Amnesty for all political prisoners and officers exiled to the Aegean islands; (4) Reorganizing the army to include people of all views; (5) Revising the electoral rolls for the constitutional assembly; (6) Stipulating a foreign policy of equal friendship with all allies. If these conditions are not accepted, they will intensify their resistance.</p>
<h3>Hurricane Damages Guam, Military Plans Thwarted</h3>

<h3>General Assembly of Peace Conference Passes Resolution to Expedite Work, Byrnes Expresses Optimism About Future of Peace Conference</h3>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 26th] The Peace Conference held a plenary meeting tonight, and after a heated debate between Chairman Byrnes and the representatives of Yugoslavia, Ukraine, and the Soviet Union on the rules of procedure, unanimously passed a four-power resolution to expedite the work of the Peace Conference and adjourn on October 15. The Yugoslav representative asked the General Assembly to pay attention to Greece's request for Albania to cede the Northern Epirus region, and the Greek representative surprisingly expressed his willingness to withdraw this request on the spot.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper] Paris, 27th Broadcast: General Mossot, Chairman of the Military Committee, proposed that the review of the various clauses be completed as early as September 28, before the deadline stipulated by the General Assembly. However, whether the clauses for Hungary and Finland can be completed on time is still a question, so the committee decided to hold two meetings a day. Soviet representative Novikov advocated stopping unproductive work and shortening the report submitted to the Italian Political and Territorial Committee.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 26th] Byrnes stated at a press conference that he was very satisfied with President Truman's recent statement that the US foreign policy remains unchanged. Since the opening of the Peace Conference two months ago, small countries have had ample opportunities to speak, and he feels optimistic about the future of the Peace Conference. According to Bei, it is the first time to express public optimism</p>

<h3>He Yingqin Talks About Building an International Army</h3>
<p>[United Press International, Long Island, New York, 26th] He Yingqin, the Chinese representative to the United Nations Military Staff Committee, met with reporters at his residence here today and stated that after 20 years of military life, he has experienced the tragedy of war. The general hope for world peace must be based on mutual trust among all countries. Establishing a world army under the control of the United Nations that can reach the most remote areas of the world in three or four days is the ideal way to maintain world peace. He believes that the US plan to conduct inspections in various countries is the only way to stop the accelerated approach to war. He also stated that Chinese intelligence proved that Japan had considered a truce in June 1945 due to heavy ship losses. He learned after the war that Japan was researching a "death ray" that could be fatal within one kilometer, but it had been destroyed before the surrender.</p>

<h3>Britain and the Soviet Union Compete for Greece - News Analysis by This Newspaper</h3>
<p>King George II of Greece, who was in exile in London during the war, has returned to power today due to the support of the vast majority of the people in the recent referendum. Since Greece was invaded by German troops in April 1941, resulting in its fall, it has been more than five and a half years, and it has now restored its pre-war political order, which is naturally a great joy. But this matter, especially today, when Britain and the Soviet Union are competing for hegemony in the Balkans, has an even deeper meaning.</p>
<p>Greece, a country with a glorious history of ancient politics and culture, can be said to have gone through many vicissitudes in the past hundred years. Since the division of the Roman Empire in the fifth century, Greece was annexed by Turkey in 1473. It was not until the outbreak of the revolution for independence in 1821 that it finally succeeded after eight years of bloody struggle, and separated from Turkey to become independent. But as soon as the rule of Turkey came to an end, the power of Russia stepped in. In 1828, when the independence movement had not yet fully succeeded, Count John Capodistrias, who had served as Foreign Minister to the Russian Emperor Alexander, was elected President of the Greek Republic. However, due to his excessive pro-Russian policy and the government's autocratic dictatorship, the Greek people were greatly dissatisfied, and the new president was eventually assassinated. In 1830, it was announced that the political system would be changed to a monarchy, and Prince Otto of Bavaria was elected as the first King of Greece. At this time, Greece was under the protection of Britain, France, and Russia, and the leaders of the government each formed pro-British, pro-French, and pro-Russian groups, opposing each other. In 1862, Otto was driven out of the country, and with the support of Britain, Prince Alfred was elected to succeed the throne. Since then, Britain's power in Greece has far surpassed that of Russia.</p>
<p>In 1923, the current King George II ascended the throne. In March of the following year, a revolution broke out in the country, establishing a republic, and the King fled the country. In 1935, as a result of a referendum, it was agreed to restore the monarchy, and George II returned to the country. At the beginning of this World War, Greece originally declared neutrality, but due to the pro-British attitude of its government, it had long been resented by Germany and Italy. In 1940, Italy issued an ultimatum to Greece, demanding that Italian troops occupy several strategic locations in Greece. The Greek government replied and refused, and Italian troops invaded from the Albanian border. German troops also sent troops to assist. Although Greece had the assistance of British troops, it continued to retreat. In April 1941, the capital Athens fell, and both the British and Greek governments retreated to Crete. German troops then landed paratroopers on Crete. The island had already been largely under the influence of the Soviet Union, so the status of Greece became even more important to Britain. This small piece of land, with an area of only 50,147 square miles, currently occupies an extremely important strategic position in the Mediterranean. Its northwestern neighbor Albania, its northern neighbor Yugoslavia, and its northeastern neighbor Bulgaria have all become areas of Soviet influence. It is bordered by the Aegean Sea to the east and faces Turkey across the sea, close to the Adriatic Sea to the west, and facing the vast Mediterranean Sea to the south. If the Soviet Union's power invades this area again, Britain's hegemony in the Mediterranean will be completely shaken.</p>
<p>The recent referendum decided whether to support the restoration of the King or to form another republican government. As a result, among the 1,779,924 votes, 1,135,675 voted in favor of restoring the King, and only 521,540 voted against it, with the rest being invalid votes. This matter was certainly a great success for Britain, but on the other hand, it also symbolizes a major setback for the Soviet Union's southward expansion. Before the vote, the Soviet Union launched a large-scale diplomatic offensive, first accusing the British troops' stay in Greece of endangering peace, and then inciting Ukraine to file a complaint against Greece in the recent United Nations Security Council. This was originally intended by the Soviet Union as a kind of diplomatic pressure, and to stir up the Greek people's suspicion of Britain, but unexpectedly, the result turned out to be counterproductive, causing the resentment of most of the Greek people. The reason why the pro-monarchy faction was able to achieve such an unexpected victory in this referendum lies in this. Recently, three events have occurred in the Balkans and the Middle East, all symbolizing the decline of Soviet power: (1) In Turkey, with the support of Britain and the United States, Turkey strongly rejected the Soviet Union's request to jointly manage the Dardanelles Strait. (2) In Yugoslavia, regarding the incident in which the southern country shot down two US transport planes, due to the strong pressure from the United States and the failure of the Soviet Union to provide southern countries with support in practice, Yugoslavia had no choice but to completely succumb. (3) In Greece, the result of this vote has dealt a serious blow to the Soviet Union. Therefore, this Greek referendum is not just a question of whether a king can return, but represents the balance of power between Britain and the Soviet Union, the Western bloc and the Soviet bloc, in the Balkan Peninsula.</p>
<p>Currently, the Greek Communist army has rebelled, and a civil war may break out. If the Greek government is unable to contain it, the British troops stationed in Greece will intervene to help quell the internal unrest. Whether this will lead to a conflict between the two major powers behind the scenes is a matter of great concern in this era of volatile international situations, where everyone is on edge.</p>

<h3>Petition Group of City Council Decides to Go to the Capital the Day After Tomorrow. Resolution Made in Yesterday's Conversation Meeting. Three More Guiding Principles Proposed: Establish Economic Policies, Establish an Economic Revival Association in Shanghai, and Allocate Special Funds for the Revival of Shanghai.</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The City Council's eleven councilors organized a petition group to advise the government to improve financial policies as soon as possible. Yesterday at 3 p.m., a conversation meeting was held at the Fuming City Council. Except for Councilor Wang Xianqing, who was in Hangzhou, Deputy Speaker Xu Jiqing, Councilors Xu Guomao, Jin Runxiang, Luo Qinghua, Wang Yansong, Tao Baichuan, Yang Fusheng, Xi Yushu, Yu Zuoting, and Liu Jingji, totaling ten people, attended. Speaker Pan Gongzhan also attended. During the meeting, Speaker Pan first reported two points of view from the outside world regarding this petition group: (1) Some people believe that the previous petition by the business community to the capital did not yield any results, and they are deeply afraid that this petition by the councilors will repeat the same mistakes and still yield no results. (2) However, some people still expressed that this matter is of great importance, and regardless of the success or failure of the petition, the mission is still necessary, at least to enable the government to understand the opinions of the citizens of Shanghai and also to fulfill the wishes of the people of the country. Therefore, they have high hopes for the petition group. Speaker Pan continued, stating that this petition is by no means a mass movement but a rational statement. Therefore, he hoped that the delegation would conduct preliminary research and separate resolutions on the most important and secondary matters before departure, and exchange opinions to prepare.</p>
<p>Subsequently, Deputy Speaker Xu proposed, and the councilors agreed, to depart for the capital separately next Monday (the 30th). On October 1st, at 9 a.m., they will meet at the Zhejiang Industrial Bank in Nanjing and then go to the Executive Yuan to petition. On the morning of October 2nd, they will go to the Supreme National Defense Council to petition. They will also submit written petitions and telegrams to the Chairman of the National Government, the Central Standing Committee of the Central Party Headquarters, the President of the Executive Yuan, the Minister of Finance, the Minister of Economic Affairs, the Minister of Agriculture and Forestry, the Minister of Transportation, and the Supreme National Defense Council. In addition, special telegrams will be sent to Wu Dingchang, Chief Secretary of the National Government, and Yu Jishi, Chief of Staff, requesting them to present the reports and arrange meeting times to meet with the Chairman, President Song, and the ministers of various departments. The representatives are scheduled to return to Shanghai on October 2nd. The travel expenses to the capital will be borne by the representatives themselves. After the petition group returns to Shanghai, a press conference will be held.</p>
<p>The conversation meeting resolved to propose three more guiding principles to be presented to the highest authorities: (1) Establish economic policies. The government's economic policies during the war were indeed flawed, and it is even more wrong to apply the previous policies after the war. Currently, the government's economic measures are inconsistent, with "saying" one thing and "doing" another. If this continues, the economic future will be unimaginable. To save the industrial and commercial crisis, the government must act consistently, strictly adhere to the teachings of Dr. Sun Yat-sen, and implement the economic policies of the Three Principles of the People. (2) In terms of organization: The government should establish an Economic Revival Committee in Shanghai. Since the victory of this war, the central government has established many agencies in Shanghai to receive a large amount of materials. However, no organization has been established to provide relief and revive Shanghai's economy. Therefore, it is proposed to petition the central government to consider Shanghai and establish a formal organization, requesting President Song to personally serve as the chairman, with the mayor and the speaker of the City Council as vice-chairmen, and inviting major industrial, commercial, and financial institutions in the city to participate jointly. At the very least, this can enable the government and the people to understand each other's difficulties. (3) Request the central government to allocate 50% of the funds from the Enemy Property Administration for the materials received as special funds for the revival of Shanghai.</p>
<p>Furthermore, councilors expressed their opinions, believing that this organization should be sustainable and hoping that the government would value public opinion and do its best to assist in achieving its goals. The petitions submitted by the petition group to the relevant government agencies are as follows:</p>
<h3>Proposed Telegram</h3>
<p>The victory of the Anti-Japanese War has been over a year. Because the national economic policies have not fully met the people's expectations, and financial measures have failed to coordinate with the reconstruction plan, prices have risen daily, the value of currency has fallen, production has been trapped in a dead end, the financial situation has become increasingly unbalanced, the trade deficit has increased daily, and economic collapse is imminent. The handling of enemy and puppet properties has been mishandled, and corruption has been rampant, causing public resentment to boil over. This city has always been the economic and financial center of the country and deeply understands the details and feels the pain firsthand. Since the opening of the first session of the first congress of this council, the city's Chamber of Commerce, the Banking and Money Trade Association, the China Tea Association, and councilors Wang Zhengting, Luo Qinghua, Liu Jingji, Lao Jingxiu, and Mei Huaishu have addressed the current malpractices and proposed concrete solutions. After careful review by this council, the congress solemnly resolved the case. Now, we specifically extract its outline and list it on the left:</p>
<p>Regarding the adjustment of banking business:</p>
<p>(1) In order to improve the efficiency of national banks, the government should strengthen the specialization of banks. The central bank must fulfill its function as a "bank of banks" and handle rediscounting and re-mortgaging so that the banking industry is happy to accept production loans. At the same time, reduce the deposit reserve ratio, confirm the performance of the reserve, and actively utilize it. (2) Commercial banks have close relationships with industry and commerce. The government should relax the management methods for commercial banks and effectively support them to indirectly support industry and commerce.</p>
<p>Regarding the adjustment of agricultural, industrial, and commercial funds:</p>
<p>(1) All factories lack production funds. Long-term, low-interest, and planned industrial loans should be conducted to increase production and guarantee repayment. (2) For factory loans, state-owned specialized banks should investigate the actual needs of industrial production of each factory and provide low-interest loans. The collateral should not be limited to raw materials and finished products. All factory buildings, machinery, and real estate should be allowed to be provided as collateral. The acceptance of remittances and the sales financing of goods should be actively undertaken to facilitate the flow of goods. (3) In rural areas, due to the years of burning by soldiers, the purchase of seeds, plows, and agricultural tools, the management of water conservancy, and the prevention of disasters all require borrowing a large amount of funds. Agricultural loans should continue to be actively conducted. As for the production and processing loans for agricultural export products such as raw silk, tung oil, and tea, they should not be suspended. With the autumn harvest in sight, low grain prices are passed on to farmers. To protect the production interests of farmers, the China Farmers Bank is expected to quickly launch grain loans and cotton loans. (4) All loans should be provided at the lowest possible interest rate, and loan procedures should be simplified. (5) To prevent excessive issuance of currency, in-kind loans can be provided separately. The government should provide necessary materials, such as production raw materials, fuels, and machinery equipment, to the factories that actually need them to develop co-production. (6) Organize an industrial revival investment company with a capital of 2 billion US dollars, of which one-quarter is raised by the private sector. All private funds overseas should be allowed to be invested first. The remaining three-quarters are raised from overseas Chinese and foreigners. The government stipulates guaranteed principal and interest to promote it.</p>
<p>Regarding the development of international trade:</p>
<p>(1) Implement an import and export linkage system (either linked in terms of amount or linked according to its type, such as importers of cotton, responsible for exporting yarn within a certain period), and supplement it with export subsidies or high-priced purchases. The government should purchase certain materials related to barter and debt repayment at high prices to maintain agriculture. (3) Implement a barter system. For example, at the beginning of the Anti-Japanese War, the government used tea to barter with the Soviet Union and airlifted it to the United States to support sales in North Africa, which achieved considerable results. This method is most suitable for countries that control international trade, such as the Soviet Union, and is also an urgent requirement for tea merchants. (3) Use economic diplomacy to expand the market. Taking Chinese tea as an example, some countries' tariffs have unfavorable regulations on Chinese tea. For example, the United Kingdom limits this year's Chinese tea imports to 2.5 million pounds, only 20% of the amount of Chinese tea exported to the UK in 1937. The United States restricts prices for Chinese tea due to price restrictions. For example, Casablanca, the center of the North African green tea market, which is the largest market for Chinese silk and tea, has not yet established a consulate. Tea merchants are greatly hindered in their trade due to lack of guidance and contact. It is proposed to increase the number of consulates as soon as possible to protect and promote trade. (4) Exempt goods for export from commodity tax to reduce costs.</p>
<p>Regarding enlivening local land finance:</p>
<p>(1) For land finance, the government should quickly formulate measures and actively implement them to develop agricultural finance. (2) The draft Banking Law limits the maximum period for a bank to re-sell real estate after it has been taken over to only one year, which is too short and should be amended. (3) Shanghai's industrial and commercial sectors often use real estate as an important guarantee for financing from the banking industry. However, in recent years, banks such as the Central Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Farmers Bank do not use real estate as collateral for financing to the industrial and commercial sectors. Commercial banks and firms therefore dare not accept it. This is the biggest obstacle to enlivening land finance and should be improved by the government as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Regarding compensating for the losses of the city's Anti-Japanese War:</p>
<p>(1) All losses suffered by resuming factories should be compensated by the government as soon as possible, and they should be allowed to preferentially accept confiscated enemy and puppet factories and raw materials under preferential conditions to complete industrial recovery. (2) The Enemy and Puppet Property Administration handles materials, factories, and houses in the Shanghai area, and the total value of the proceeds from the auction can reach more than one trillion yuan. They are all the fat and blood that the enemy and puppets plundered from the citizens of Shanghai and should be returned to the city to restore vitality. According to the meaning of the central and local equalization of rights, half should be allocated to the city for construction, culture, and public welfare.</p>
<p>Regarding solving the city's fuel panic:</p>
<p>This city has many factories and a large population, and the demand for fuel is very large. Since the victory, coal mines in coal-producing areas have been unable to provide a steady supply due to traffic obstructions. The Central Fuel Management Committee has added control over the purchase and sale of coal. As a result, the famine for coal has become increasingly serious, and the price of coal has risen increasingly. If this continues, it will not only affect production but also hinder the people's livelihood. The control should be lifted quickly to encourage citizens to freely purchase, sell, and adjust supply and demand to relieve the people's difficulties. In summary, these are the most pressing problems in the city today. The city's Chamber of Commerce, after the ninth congress in August, summarized the important resolutions on economic construction, created an outline, and sent personnel to the capital to pay their respects to the Central Standing Committee, the National Government, the Supreme National Defense Conference, the Executive and Legislative Yuans, and the Ministries of Finance and Economy to petition. However, after more than a month, there has been no effective approval. After the recent adjustment of exchange rates by the central government, exports have not improved due to production costs being higher than foreign market prices, and domestic prices have risen first. Following this, the Four Banks Joint Office issued a statement denying eight types of production loans and national banks stopping industrial loans, which is another mistake on top of a mistake, only showing the empty name of "supporting production and rewarding exports" and making the production sector even more deeply in a state of irretrievability. This council's responsibility is to convey the people's grievances. Observing the more than 3.5 million citizens in deep water and fire, eagerly hoping, we cannot remain silent any longer. In addition to sending the original six resolutions by telegram, we have specially appointed Deputy Speaker Xu Jiguang, Councilors Xi Yushu, Wang Yansong, Ling Runxiang, Liu Jingji, Luo Qinghua, Tao Baichuan, Yu Zuoting, Wang Xianqing, Xu Guomao, and Yang Fusheng, eleven people as representatives, to state the facts. We hope that you will consider the city's crisis, which the whole country shares, accept the suggestions, and implement them quickly one by one. This is for the public convenience. Pan Gongzhan, Speaker of the First City Council of Shanghai. Xu Jiqing, Deputy Speaker, bows.</p>

<h3>Two Monks from Jing'an Temple Detained After Interrogation. The Most Prominent Charge Against Them Is Implementing Slave Education. De Wu and Mi Jia Unexpectedly Entered Prison Submissively.</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Abbot De Wu and Supervisor Mi Jia of Jing'an Temple in this city were accused of communicating with the enemy and collaborating with the enemy. Yesterday morning at 11 a.m., the High Prosecutor's Office held a third court session to investigate. After investigation, it was considered that the suspicion was serious, and Prosecutor Chang Ting ordered their detention. They were sent to the Zhongzi Prison in Shanghai Prison at 12:30 p.m. Both of them were wearing black robes. Because they did not expect to be detained beforehand, they were empty-handed and did not bring anything with them. They recited Amitabha and sadly entered prison.</p>

After accepting the case, the High Prosecutor's Office summoned and investigated twice, and the defendants were allowed to be released on bail. The accusers believed that the wanted criminals were still at large, so on the 23rd of this month, they requested the City Council to uphold justice, presented the defendants' documents of collaboration with the enemy, and requested a public decision.

<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] At the 48th municipal meeting yesterday morning, Mayor Wu verbally proposed to implement the principles decided by the City Council, intending to reduce redundant personnel to save municipal administrative expenses. He immediately instructed that the standard for layoffs should be 15% in principle, and the affiliated bureaus and offices should consider and implement it themselves. At that time, Mayor Wu left early in a hurry due to other important official business, so the detailed methods and specific steps were not decided. However, it was decided that those whose actual number of personnel did not exceed the central government's establishment number could be handled at their discretion.</p>
<p>[Another Report] After the Executive Yuan's instruction on the "Methods of Punishing Those Who Held Puppet Positions but Were Not Convicted Under the Traitor Law" arrived at the municipal government, the mayor ordered all affiliated bureaus and offices to conduct strict investigations and submit the list of such personnel to the Personnel Office of the municipal government.

<h3>Forced Poor Son-in-Law to Death</h3>
<p>Stealing Glass Was Severely Beaten, Tried to Escape, Was Chased, Jumped into River and Drowned</p>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Qian Jinyuan, 21 years old, from Qianjiatang Village, Jiangwan, married Fengyuan (21 years old), the daughter of Wang Fuquan, the owner of a tobacco paper shop in Jiangwan Town, as his wife through a matchmaker several years ago. They had a son. The Huang family was well-off, while Qian Jinyuan was very poor. Therefore, he moved to his wife's family with his wife Fengyuan. He usually helped with chores, which led to contempt from the Huang family, and the relationship between the young couple became increasingly cold, and quarrels occurred from time to time. On the afternoon of the 24th of this month, Qian Jinyuan stole two pieces of glass from his father-in-law's flower shed and was caught by Huang Quanxing, the cousin of his brother-in-law Huang Quanxing. He was taken back to the Huang residence. His father-in-law Fuquan, without asking the reason, grabbed a tree stick and beat Qian severely, causing injuries. He also used ropes to tie him up and hang him upside down on a tree. Jinyuan cried for help, struggled hard, the rope broke and he fell to the ground, and he got up and tried to escape. Huang and his ten nephews chased after him. When he chased him to a small river, Qian was anxious and jumped into the river to swim to the other side. The three members of the Huang family still detoured and chased him relentlessly. Unexpectedly, Qian escaped for about half a mile and encountered a large river several feet deep. Qian was forced to chase and had to ignore everything. He jumped into the water and tried to swim across. In the end, he was tragically drowned due to the wide river surface. Not long after, Jinyuan's mother (59 years old) heard the news and reported it to the Jiangwan Branch Bureau. The branch director Chen Dagong sent police to investigate, and the body was fished out and reported to the court for an autopsy. The murderers Huang Fuquan and others have fled in fear of crime, and the police station is currently tracking them down.</p>
<h3>Shanghai-Hangzhou Group of Investigation Team Discusses Handling Matters in a Temporary Conversation Meeting. Makes Final Decision on the Municipal Government's Corruption Case.</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The Shanghai-Hangzhou Group of the Investigation Team for the Receipt and Handling of Enemy and Puppet Properties in the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui Regions held a temporary conversation meeting at the Jiangsu Supervisory Envoy's Office yesterday morning at 10:00 a.m. Group Leader Zhang Zhiben, Commissioners Cheng Zhonghang, Fan Zhengbo, Wu Wangji, Zhang Qingzhen, Zhao Junhao, Ma Junshuo, He Yuanming, Wang Jian'e, and others attended, discussing the conclusion of the group's work and the handling of important cases.

<p>According to sources, in yesterday's meeting, the attendees thoroughly studied the municipal government's 4 billion corruption case, which has attracted much attention, from the perspectives of administrative punishment and legal viewpoints, and made a final decision. The municipal government's unauthorized disposal of received materials was clearly illegal, without any doubt. However, the case will not be sent to court.</p>
<h3>The Li Songling Case Has All Documents Collected and Officially Transferred to the High Prosecutor's Office</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The Shanghai-Hangzhou Group of the Receiving Work Investigation Team previously received a secret report: Li Songling colluded with the enemy and suddenly became rich, buying a large number of properties. After being seized, they were returned, which was suspicious. We pray that the case will be thoroughly investigated and dealt with. We have learned that the group has transferred the documents to the handling bureau for review, believing that whether Li Songling is a traitor should be clarified by the judicial authorities. Whether the seizure was carried out by someone who was corrupt and whether the handling bureau approved the return should also be investigated. Yesterday, all the documents were collected and officially transferred to the Shanghai Higher People's Procuratorate for investigation.</p>
<p>According to investigation, Li Songling was originally a dock worker. After the city fell, he colluded with Japanese ruffians to steal coal from Pudong. Later, he cooperated with the enemy, controlled land and water transportation, and served as a compradore for Mitsubishi Corporation of Japan. He accumulated concubines, built Chinese mansions, and entertained Japanese for gambling and comfort. Li's properties include Maoling Village on Qiqi Road, Maoling New Village on Yaozhu Road, Maoling Villa on Fulvli Road, and Tianshicheng Maoji Silver Building and Anhua Bank stocks on Nanjing Road and Sanma Road. It is heard that Li Songling has transferred his property and fled to Hong Kong.</p>
<h3>Receiving the Zhanghua Factory – Concealing Materials Case – Requesting Original Inventory List from the Ministry of Economic Affairs</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Regarding the receipt of the Zhanghua Woolen Mill, and allegations of corrupt conduct, the Investigation Team has conducted a detailed investigation since receiving the confidential report. It is understood that: "Zhanghua" was a partnership operated by Liu Hongsheng and others, forcibly occupied by the enemy. After the victory, the Ministry of Economic Affairs dispatched Li Zhizhan to be responsible for the takeover, and later dispatched Liu Hongsheng to jointly participate in the takeover. After the enemy occupied Zhanghua, the equipment was greatly expanded, and a great deal of raw materials were stored. Now Zhanghua should be returned to the original shareholders at their request. The parts expanded by the enemy will be nationalized, and the Ministry of Economic Affairs will sell them to Zhanghua at a price. It is said that the equipment and materials of the expanded part by the enemy have been concealed. However, regarding this point, no clues have been found in the files of the Enemy and Puppet Property Administration Bureau. The Investigation Team is now requesting the original inventory list from the Ministry of Economic Affairs. As for the allegation in the confidential report that Zhang Zi Kuo accepted a bribe of one hundred gold bars, the person in charge of the Investigation Team believes that there is no basis for this.</p>
<h3>Dah Tong Bank Comprador and Others – Accused of Stealing and Occupying Cemetery Land</h3>

Wang Detang requests compensation of 20 million yuan for coffin relocation and reburial expenses. The District Court held a trial yesterday and advised the two parties to attempt reconciliation out of court, scheduling a retrial for October 4.</p>
<h3>Brother-Slaying Bloodshed Case – Elderly Father Arrives in Shanghai from Ningbo</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Regarding the case in which Xiao Zhang Zhongfu, owner of the Yongshunxing waste paper store on Beijing Road, used a knife to kill his elder brother Zhongming and seriously injure his sister-in-law Sheng, the details of the murderer fleeing in fear of punishment have been reported in this newspaper. It is now known that yesterday afternoon, the deceased's elderly father, Zhang Junfu, arrived in Shanghai from his hometown in Ningbo.

According to Zhang's statement, he went to the countryside due to some matter when the incident occurred. The police are currently searching for the fugitive.</p>
<h3>After the Hurricane's Forewing Passed – Shanghai Became a City of Water – Sewage Swirling, Knee-Deep – Public Works Bureau Says Improvements Can Be Made Next Year</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper] The hurricane's forewing swept across this city the day before yesterday. The hurricane has passed, but it has left Shanghai with a vast expanse of water. Linsen Road, Zhongzheng Road, Nanjing Road, Daxi Road, Huashan Road, Robison Road... Almost the entire city of Shanghai, wherever it is slightly low-lying, has become a "Venice of China."</p>
<p>On Nanjing Road, pedestrians at most find the water inconvenient, at most feel that they are being fleeced a few more times by rickshaw pullers. On Linsen Road, the rippling water may even add a lot of poetic charm to this neat and quiet street. However, in the densely populated areas, in the areas where workers and the poor, the so-called lower classes, are concentrated, the water appears so ugly, so cursed.</p>
<p>In the center of Changshou Road (Robison Road), around the large chiming clock, the water is knee-deep. Passing by tram number 16 or 24, a stench reaches the nostrils from afar. People walk barefoot, rolling up their trouser legs, through the stinking water mixed with all kinds of filth. The low, dark shops and houses on both sides of the road, with water submerging the black mud inside, or the dilapidated floors, appear so damp, so damp that it feels like mold is growing in one's heart. However, the people living in those houses continue to live their lives, staring blankly at the water outside the door and smiling foolishly. And many ragged, thin children, the water has brought them great joy. They jump, chase, and play in the water. When the tram passes, a wave is stirred up, and they use their little hands to splash water, laughing so happily. The dirty and foul water pool is as great and beautiful as the ocean in their little hearts. Is the Chinese people's optimism, acceptance of fate, patience, and peace cultivated from such a young age?</p>
<p>The cause of the water accumulation is said to be that the tide gates were closed, and the rainwater could not be discharged in time. Along Suzhou Road to Zhongzheng Road, 164 tide gates have been built, and another 30 are under construction in the former French Concession area. The most important one, Jijiabang, will be completed next month. There is also a water pump that can pump 60,000 gallons of water per hour, which will start working at the end of this year and the beginning of spring. The Public Works Bureau has issued a check, saying that by that time, the areas around Risheng Building, Yuyuan Road, and Haining Road in the former British Concession, and the area near the Lyceum Theatre in the former French Concession, will no longer have the phenomenon of backflow from the ditches. This is great news, worth reporting to the citizens of Shanghai. But, I can't help but think of the stinking big chiming clock area, and the many, many poor areas that are not noticed, will they also no longer be filled with stench at that time?</p>
<h3>Rickshaws to be Banned – To be Phased out in Three Years – Lottery to be Drawn Starting in November</h3>
<p>Regarding the ban on rickshaws in this city, Chairman Chiang ordered the Executive Yuan to instruct the Shanghai Municipal Government to ban them within a time limit and to comply with the instructions. If they still do not comply by winter, they will be treated as disobeying orders. After receiving the order, the Municipal Government immediately instructed the Public Utilities Bureau to work with the Police Bureau and the Social Affairs Bureau to draft a plan for review. The Public Utilities Bureau, in compliance with the order, consulted with the Police and Social Affairs Bureaus and decided: (1) The Public Utilities Bureau will use a lottery method to phase out the rickshaws completely in three years. In the first year, 10% will be phased out first, totaling 2,065 operating rickshaws and 630 private rickshaws. The percentage to be phased out in the second year will be determined based on the results. (2) The Social Affairs Bureau will draft detailed measures for the relief of rickshaw pullers, and will also draft implementation measures for managing and banning rickshaws and operating manufacturing sites for rickshaw bodies and parts, to be jointly submitted to the Municipal Government for review by the three bureaus. Subsequently, the Chamber of Commerce sent a letter stating that the majority of rickshaw pullers are from northern Jiangsu, have no homes to return to, and the city's industry and commerce are becoming increasingly depressed, making it difficult to accommodate them. It requested a delay in implementation. The Public Utilities Bureau submitted this to the Municipal Government, which telegraphed the Executive Yuan for approval to accommodate the situation and implement the ban starting next year. Now, because it seems difficult to delay the case any further, the Public Utilities Bureau has drafted and presented implementation steps based on the previous plan jointly submitted by the three bureaus: (1) Starting from October 1, investigate and register rickshaw pullers and rickshaws, as well as parts manufacturing factories, with a target of completing this within one month. (2) Hold a lottery on November 1 to determine the rickshaw numbers to be phased out, using 10% of the total number as the standard, and requiring the licenses to be returned before the end of the year. (3) Starting in October, prepare in advance for small-sum loans to rickshaw pullers who are selected in the lottery, phased out, and return their licenses, according to the Social Affairs Bureau's proposed small-sum loan relief measures, starting in November. (4) The Social Affairs Bureau will expedite the planning and implementation of small-sum loan relief measures. (5) Regarding the expansion of other transportation tools, the Public Bus Company Preparatory Committee is currently carefully formulating a plan and will first purchase a large number of vehicles to expand routes. For the connection between the suburbs of the city and the adjacent counties, the Suburban Public Bus Route Review Committee has resolved to hand over the various suburban routes to businesses for operation. After the Municipal Government approves, it will order all routes to be opened to traffic by November. The above is the process of banning rickshaws and the implementation steps passed by yesterday's municipal meeting.</p>
<h3>Verdict in Case Against American Reporter – Randall Declared Not Guilty – Reasons Explained in Two Parts</h3>
<p>The News Published by the Defendant Proved Not to Be Fabricated</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The case in which Shen Ke, a German Nazi spy suspect, sued Randall, the head of the Shanghai office of the American United Press, for defamation, was pronounced by the District Court yesterday afternoon, finding Randall not guilty. The reasons for the verdict are as follows: This case is explained in two parts:</p>
<p>Procedural Issues</p>
<p>Article 311 of the Criminal Procedure Law stipulates that the victim of a crime may file a private prosecution. Therefore, the only requirement for a private prosecutor is that they are a person who has been directly harmed by the crime, and there are no other restrictions. Therefore, whether they are citizens of an enemy country or war criminals who are being repatriated is irrelevant. In this case, the private prosecutor is a German national who is being repatriated. The US Military Headquarters in China has initiated a public prosecution against them as a suspected war criminal and is currently detaining them at the US Military Headquarters in China. According to the above explanation, before our government has suspended the right of enemy aliens to sue, they are still able to file a private prosecution. Moreover, Article 23 of the 1907 Hague Convention on Land Warfare, Customary Law Convention states: "In addition to the prohibitions stipulated in special treaties, the following are specifically prohibited... Article 8 states that declaring the rights or right to sue of the people of the enemy country as invalid, or suspending or making them unenforceable in court." According to this provision, which is within the chapter on combat, this is still the case during combat. After the cessation of combat, it is even more obvious that the right to sue of the people of the enemy country cannot be suspended, because if the right to sue is not allowed, then all their private rights will be illegally infringed, disrupting social order. Therefore, modern international law provides protection for people of the enemy country residing within the jurisdictional area of the warring country's courts, and their right to sue is generally not suspended as a result. International law scholars and precedents from various countries lack precedents for this. Furthermore, according to our country's criminal law, those who are deprived of public rights are only deprived of the qualifications to be civil servants, the qualifications to be candidates for public office, and the qualifications to exercise the four powers of election, recall, initiative, and referendum. Article 36 of the Criminal Law clearly stipulates this, and the right to sue is not among those deprived. Therefore, even if the private prosecutor is a war criminal and has been deprived of public rights, their right to sue is not affected. Furthermore, Article 295 of the Criminal Procedure Law stipulates that judgments of inadmissibility should be issued in the following cases: "1. The prosecution procedure violates the regulations. 2. The case has already been prosecuted publicly or privately and is being prosecuted again in the same court. 3. For crimes that require a complaint or request, no complaint or request has been made, or the complaint or request has been withdrawn, or the complaint period has expired. 4. A decision not to prosecute or a withdrawal of prosecution has been made and is in violation of the provisions of Article 239, and a new prosecution is filed. 5. The defendant has died. 6. The court has no jurisdiction over the defendant. 7. Trial may not be conducted in accordance with the provisions of Article 8." The prosecution of enemy aliens or war criminals is not listed among these cases. If it is not accepted, there is no legal basis for it. Therefore, the private prosecution of the private prosecutor in this case is not inappropriate in terms of procedure, and this is explained first.</p>
<p>Substantive Issues</p>
<p>The private prosecutor alleges that the Shanghai English-language China Press published on April 16, 1946, an article stating that Shen Ke, a former reporter for the German Völkischer Beobachter, received special training in Germany and served as a staff member of the Nazi High Command. The US authorities claimed that Shen Ke was ordered to go to Chongqing to expose secret workers in Chongqing who were active in coastal cities, and to find routes for Americans and other prohibited personnel to escape to the free areas of China. This record was news released by the American United Press managed by the defendant, arbitrarily damaging his reputation. This court finds that the fact that the dissemination of words is sufficient to damage the reputation of others, and that this can be proven to be true, is not punishable, as Article 310, Paragraph 3 of the Criminal Law clearly states. In this case, the private prosecutor Shen Ke was indeed a special commissioner of the "Ehardt" agency of the German General Command's intelligence department, illegally engaged in military activities in Shanghai to resist the United States and its allies, collecting, editing, and transmitting news about the military activities of the United States and its allies' armies, navies, and air forces, and providing the "Ehardt" agency with other reports and assistance that were beneficial to the Japanese army. This has been verified by the US Military Headquarters in China and prosecuted, and was fully disclosed in the press release of the US Military Headquarters in China on June 18 of this year. Therefore, the news published by the defendant in the China Press is not without basis. Moreover, since the private prosecutor is detained at the US Military Headquarters in China as a war criminal, which is admitted by the private prosecutor, the defendant has no defamation to speak of. As for the news disclosed in the Xinwenbao Shenbao on April 16 of this year, since it was not released by the defendant's United Press, it is not related to the defendant, and it is sufficient to prove that the fact that the private prosecutor is a spy is already a well-known fact. Furthermore, although the travel passport presented by the private prosecutor is sufficient to prove that the private prosecutor had entered Vietnam via Chongqing and Guiyang in July 1941 and then transferred to Hanoi to Shanghai, the private prosecutor could not have gone to Chongqing again after arriving in Shanghai, and it is not sufficient to prove that the private prosecutor is not a spy. The certificates presented by Chen Jie and Wu Shaoshu, not to mention that the effect of these certificates is different from the sworn testimony, which is difficult to adopt as the basis for the judgment, and the defendant is indeed a spy, as has been verified by the US Military Headquarters in China and prosecuted, it is difficult to oppose it with empty certificates. Since the news published by the defendant has been proven to be non-fabricated and is not unrelated to the public interest, his behavior should not be punished. Therefore, a verdict of not guilty is rendered. Based on the above arguments and conclusions, the judgment is based on Article 393, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Procedure Law.</p>

<p>At 10:00 AM the day before yesterday, employees of the Shanghai Fish Market near the North Railway Station were loading and transporting fish that had arrived to the market to be concentrated for trading in accordance with the regulations. Suddenly, many scalpers swarmed forward to obstruct the transportation. The situation was tense. Later, the employees of the fish market asked the relevant sub-bureau to send police to assist, and the situation calmed down. This shows that the latent power of the scalpers in that area still exists.</p>

<h3>Minister Zhu Hosted Capital Press Corps Yesterday – Reported on Current Educational Issues – Investigation into Dismissal of Jinan University Professors Has Been Dispatched – Hoping to Provide as Much Relief as Possible for Students Unable to Attend School</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch from Nanjing, 27th] The Ministry of Education hosted the press corps at 9:00 AM on the 27th. Minister Zhu Jiahua gave a report on current educational issues. Directors, secretaries, supervisors, and specialists, a total of six people, accompanied him and supplemented his report: (1) Two-thirds of the schools evacuated to the rear have been restored, one-third are en route, and a small portion is still in Chongqing. The opening dates of the schools will be in early January next year. (2) Although self-funded students must take an exam, the admission standards will be lenient. Zhu said: He hoped that the people of the country would not ignore China's scientific progress in the past 20 years. Domestic research institutes are available for further study, and it is not necessary to study abroad at one's own expense unless absolutely necessary, because the exchange rate is very high. The increase in the number of Chinese people will result in a large foreign exchange loss. The central government has approved 100 translators for studying abroad. The translators requested an increase to 360, which has been submitted to the central government for approval.</p>
<p>Admission Quotas for Studying Abroad</p>
<p>(3) For the study abroad exam, the Ministry of Education will select 120 government-funded students, 50 Sino-French exchange students, and 20 from the Sino-British Education Fund (i.e., the Boxer Indemnity Fund) Board of Directors, for a total of 190 students, and the results will be announced soon. (4) The Ministry of Education can only provide convenience for college students evacuated from the rear who return to their hometowns to transfer to other schools, but cannot assign them. They must take the entrance exams themselves. (5) All levels of schools are overcrowded. In recent years, education has generally developed, but wartime school buildings have been damaged. Due to economic reasons, it is not easy to restore them, which is an inevitable trend. The United States also has hundreds of thousands of students who are unable to attend school. The ministry will make its best effort to provide as much relief as possible.</p>
<p>Secondary and Elementary Schools to Implement Two-Part System</p>
<p>(6) There are currently 182 colleges and universities with 120,000 students, 1,163,000 secondary school students, and 18,600,000 elementary school students. (7) Secondary and elementary schools have implemented a two-part system, which allows each school to enroll twice as many students, thereby increasing capacity. (8) During the war, resources were scarce, equipment was simple, and the education level was reduced. We will try to improve this in the future. (9) Regarding the dismissal of professors from Jinan University, Supervisor Tong Daxi has been dispatched to Shanghai immediately to investigate the truth, in order to resolve the matter fairly and reasonably.</p>
<p>Requesting Additional Funds for Restoration</p>
<p>(10) For the restoration of the entire education system, the central government has approved 60 billion yuan for travel and repair expenses for various schools. Due to rising prices and increased transportation costs, the actual difference is very large. We have requested the Executive Yuan to add 120 billion yuan in accordance with the standard that administrative expenses should not exceed two to four times the amount approved by the central government. We are still awaiting approval. (11) After the victory, our international status has increased, and international cultural cooperation affairs have become more complex. The Higher Education Department previously had a section to handle this matter. In the future, the section will be changed to a department to strengthen the work. In addition, cultural commissioners or counselors will be stationed in the embassies of the United Kingdom, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union to facilitate progress. This matter is also being submitted for approval.</p>
<p>Extending Government Funding for Students for One Year</p>
<p>(12) It is still difficult to stop government funding for students in national secondary schools and above due to the economic situation in various places and the burden on people's lives. We have requested an extension of one year, ending in the summer of next year. Subsidies for government funding for students in private schools have also been requested to be extended for one year. However, government funding for new students has been completely stopped.</p>
<h3>Fu Sinian to Fly to Nanjing Tomorrow – Will Report a Traitor Before Leaving Beiping</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch from Beiping, 26th] Fu Sinian will leave Beiping and fly to Nanjing on the 29th. He said today that he will report a traitor before leaving Beiping, implying that the traitor is someone who once served as the puppet president of Peking University but escaped justice. He is reporting this because he is the acting president of Peking University, so he believes that all heads should report puppet heads equivalent to them. Fu believes that the acquittal of Zhang Yanqing is "the worst major event." Fu criticized the Hebei-Chahar-Suiyuan District Investigation Team, saying that "their investigations often cut people off arbitrarily," but said that "the case of Liu Naiyi's large-scale search was handled quite well." Finally, he lamented the low salaries of professors, saying, "It is fundamentally impossible to conduct academic research."</p>
<h3>An Urgent Proposal – Raise Teacher Salaries</h3>
<p>US Education Authorities at Washington Conference</p>
<p>[US Information Service, Washington, 27th] US education authorities recently convened a conference here to address the unprecedented surge in student numbers and the nationwide teacher shortage, and put forward an urgent proposal to increase teacher salaries to at least $45 per week or $2,400 per year. Currently, the average annual salary of teachers is less than $2,000, which is far lower than other public officials, resulting in about 350,000 of the 850,000 teachers switching careers. The reasons for the current shortage of competent teachers can be summarized as follows: (1) The number of normal school students decreased during the war, (2) The rapid increase in the birth rate has led to an increase in school-age children, (3) Most of those who originally intended to dedicate themselves to education have switched careers, and most of the soldiers returning from overseas intend to continue their education and are unwilling to take on the task of teachers in public schools with low salaries.</p>
<h3>Peking University Stipulates Regulations for Professors Holding Additional Classes</h3>

<h3>Recent Sharp Rise in US Dollars; Financial Inspection Office Finds Organized Speculation; San Taiyu and Two Qianzhuang Heavily Suspected</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] According to Li Lixia, the director of the Financial Institutions Reporting Office of the Central Bank, the recent fluctuations in the market for US dollars and various foreign currencies were purely caused by organized investment trading. After a close inspection, the organization recently discovered that the purchase figures reported daily by some foreign currency trading qianzhuang are  inconsistent with the exchange numbers of each zhuang in the clearing houses. Among them, San Taiyu and the two qianzhuang are the most suspected. Therefore, the Central Bank dispatched responsible personnel to check the accounts of the two zhuang yesterday. If the circumstances are serious, the perpetrators will be prosecuted according to law. The other suspected zhuang are also being strictly investigated. At the same time, all sectors of society are urged to report any zhuang found to be engaged in such speculative activities to the Financial Inspection Office of the Central Bank, so as to facilitate investigation and handling, rectify the business of each zhuang, and stabilize the financial market. It is also reported that San Tai qianzhuang, which is suspected this time, was the main protagonist in the Central Bank gold case three months ago. The zhuang was suspended from business for buying stolen gold from the Central Bank. It was closed not long ago, and then engaged in back door transactions, which is extremely inappropriate. As far as the zhuang's telephone line is concerned, there are dozens of them. The Central Bank is currently investigating thoroughly.</p>
<p>After Strict Inspection, Gold and Silver Both Became Stable</p>
<p>Last night, the Central Bank continued to strengthen controls, coupled with strict account checking, speculators did not dare to be active, and continued to stabilize. The highest opening was 2,155,000, which rose slightly to 2,167,000. In the end, the pressure increased, the account books of small money changers on Sichuan Road were inspected, people's hearts were unfavorable, and gradually returned to normal. After 10 o'clock, the Central Bank allocated 50 bars at a price of 2,150,000, and became more gloomy after 10 o'clock. It once fell to 2,140,000 before noon, and recovered slightly at noon. In the afternoon, the spot exchange was mediocre, and the next day's transaction moved at 2,170,000 before the final decision. The result was similar to the previous closing. The secret interest was still around one and a half corners.</p>
<p>Foreign currencies were stable and changed little. The highest price of the US dollar at the beginning was no more than 3,970 yuan, and the lowest price in the middle was still at 3,900 yuan. The price was slightly stable at noon. The intentions of both buyers and sellers were consistent, and the process was very peaceful. In the afternoon, the price rose slightly to 3,990 yuan following the gold market, and then finalized, resulting in an increase of 10 yuan compared with the previous closing. Hong Kong notes were stable, also rising by 5 yuan. The Hong Kong exchange rate hovered around 780 yuan. The immediate exchange rate fell to 955 yuan for sale and 935 yuan for purchase. The British exchange rate was still between 12,500 yuan and 12,700 yuan, with no major changes. There was no direct quotation for the US exchange rate.</p>
<p>Bonds Stable</p>
<p>Yesterday, foreign firms purchased Class A and B bonds, so the situation stabilized slightly. For Unified C bonds, the highest opening price was 1,800 yuan, and after the opening, it rose to 1,850 yuan. When the bank suddenly started to supply, it was immediately unsustainable, and the price dropped again to 1,720 yuan. Finally, seeing the stability of the difficult cards, it closed outside 1,800, resulting in a slight increase of 30 yuan compared with the previous closing. Classes A and B rose from 1,050 to outside 1,100, also a good 30 yuan, Class rose 50 yuan, and Class E was flat.</p>
<p>Foreign Stocks Slightly Up</p>
<p>Foreign stocks gradually picked up yesterday. Da Kang Cheng came in, and some parts saw gains. Yi Yarn was at 8,400 yuan, Yinglian at 10,200 yuan, and Yi Beer at 2,150 yuan, gradually improving. The results were slightly better than the previous closing. Yi Yarn, Yinglian, Huadefeng, and Asian Copper each rose nearly equally, Paper and Yi Beer rose slightly, and Guang was flat.</p>
<h3>Northeast Direct Remittances; Bank of China Handles Free of Charge</h3>
<p>More than a year has passed since the victory. Due to currency issues, the Northeast has not yet remitted funds. Recently, the Central Bank formulated measures for industrial and commercial remittances and drafted exchange rates, which were reported to the Economic Committee of the Northeast Headquarters and submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval and implementation. The Bank of China here is aiming to connect the economic relations between the Northeast and the mainland and develop industry and commerce. It has started handling remittances to the Northeast based on the Northeast industrial and commercial remittance measures. Remittances to and from Shenyang and Jinzhou have already been opened. Funds remitted from Shanghai to the Northeast will be converted into Northeast circulating coupons and paid to the recipient according to the Central Bank's exchange rate on the day. Funds remitted from the Northeast to this place will also be converted into legal currency at the exchange rate on the day. In order to support industry and commerce, the Bank of China will waive all remittance fees. According to the exchange rate quoted by the Central Bank, the outgoing exchange rate is one to eleven yuan and five jiao, and the incoming exchange rate is one to twelve yuan and five jiao. It is reported that the National Bank of China will also continue to handle Northeast remittances to Changchun, Yingkou, and Siping Street. Once the link is smooth, people inside and outside Guan are extremely excited. In recent days, people going to the bank to remit money have been very enthusiastic.</p>
<h3>6% British Gold Loan; Last Drawing Scheduled for End of Month</h3>
<p>The twenty-fifth drawing of the The Chinese Government 23rd Year 1924 6% Sterling Indemnity Loan will be held publicly at 10:00 AM on Monday, the 30th of this month, in the Department of Public Debt of the Ministry of Finance at Guotuan Minghui Wu Bazhansizhong. It is reported that this will be the last drawing.</p>
<h3>Artificial Silk Rises Again by 700,000; Market Exists but No Goods; Only Four or Five Boxes Traded; Japanese Goods on the Way, Exact Number Unknown</h3>
<p>The rise in artificial silk prices is jaw-dropping. Yesterday, it rose wildly again by more than 700,000 yuan. No. 120 Tianqiao opened at 650,000 yuan, an increase of more than 300,000 yuan compared with the afternoon of the previous day. Afterwards, it rose even higher, closing at 900,000 yuan. In the afternoon, the last transaction was at 4,970,000 yuan. The prices of various brand names also followed suit, rising by 600,000 to 700,000 yuan each. However, due to the shortage of goods, although the market price was high, only four or five boxes were actually traded. According to industry insiders, given the current situation, unless the source of artificial silk is found and the supply is increased, the market sentiment will remain bullish. Manufacturers have strong demand, while the actual inventory in the market is dwindling day by day. The inventory of commercial firms is even more limited, and the demand for those who need it to search and purchase becomes more and more urgent, and the price only rises and does not fall. It is urgently hoped that the relevant authorities will start from unblocking the source and increasing the supply. The reporter then visited Mr. He Zonglin, the manager of the Material Procurement and Barter Department of the Central Trust Bureau, to inquire about the shipment of Japanese artificial silk. According to him, part of the barter trade with Japan handled by the Bureau is indeed artificial silk. As for the exact quantity, because it fluctuates from time to time, it is not possible to announce a definite number. Recently, a batch of artificial silk has indeed been loaded on ships from Japan. As for the exact date of arrival, because no telegram has been received, the details are unknown. However, it is expected that it will arrive within days. After the arrival of this batch of artificial silk, we will consider evaluating the supply to meet the needs of the market.</p>
<h3>Allotted Yarn Prices Unchanged; 3,600 Pieces Allotted; Sales Not Enough, Also Affected by the Cloth Market; Cotton Cloth Still Mostly Marked Up and No Sellers</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The yarn market was slightly flat at the beginning, with prices falling compared to yesterday. 42-count spot was 2.9 million, futures were 2.8 million, and 20-count remained at the original price. Transactions are no longer as strong as before. Then, the Tianjin gang absorbed it, and the cloth mills also made up for their insufficient supply of allocated raw materials at low prices, and the price rose again by 20,000 to 30,000 yuan. However, most people in the market are wary of the style of the building that will leave the cloth open the day before, increasing sales, so the market price in the morning was generally flat. In the afternoon, it became firm again. In addition to actual sales accounts coming in at low prices, the improvement in the cloth market also brought up the price a lot. If the guest gang does not have a large number of purchases, the yarn market will turn into a spinning game.</p>
<p>The Yarn Allocation and Joint Sales Committee held its routine meeting to open yarn yesterday afternoon. It was decided to open for sale 20-count standard cotton yarn, with a quota of 2,706 pieces for private factories and 907 pieces for the Textile Construction (the Textile Construction Company's figure is 910 pieces), all of which were allocated separately according to the application amount. The selling price is 1.55 million yuan per piece, with 400 pounds of 20-count cotton yarn as the standard. The next opening date was decided to be September 30.</p>
<p>The cloth market's rising momentum has continued for two weeks. Since a large number of textiles were opened up the night before, the prices were high, and those who got the goods did not dare to hold on. Therefore, the market was tired at the beginning yesterday. Blue V fine cloth was 90,000 yuan, three A colored balls were 84,000 yuan, and Yanghe Wufu was 81,200 yuan. In addition, the street sales were greatly reduced due to the cloudy and rainy weather. Actual sales accounts did not wait and see. Loose households sold their allotted goods at discounted prices due to tight finances, so the market situation was deteriorating. Unbranded colored balls were discounted by 3,000, white printed cotton was discounted by 5,000, and Gan branch unbranded was discounted by nearly 1,000 yuan. This is a great warning for those who are used to applying for goods. Later, the dye continuing factory and the strong guest sales cloth shop absorbed the low prices, and the prices rose again due to the good prices. Not only did no one sell at discounted prices, but the high-end goods were even tighter with more markups. Some cotton fabrics had markups of 3,000 to 4,000 yuan, but there were no sellers. According to market news, the guest gangs have not yet eaten enough. If the construction department does not change its allocation policy, the rising momentum will be difficult to suppress. As for the news spread outside that Huang Niu and Dangmanji were accumulating goods, it is said that it is purely speculation outside the industry and not the truth. News revealed by Tianjin gang said that the road here is mostly broken into pieces, and then transferred to the Northeast. Although the transport is difficult, there is a severe shortage of goods in the local area, and it is said that there are several famous white goods brands in this city that have already sent people to Tianjin to set up zhuangkou to promote business.</p>
<h3>International Chamber of Commerce Report; Rate Stability is Still Early; Inflation Should be Curb</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 26th Dispatch] The International Chamber of Commerce recently submitted a report to the United Nations Economic and Social Council, emphasizing the instability of prices in various countries around the world. It pointed out that inflation is the most urgent phenomenon in the world today and may repeat the price situation of 1920-1921. To some extent, this situation is not caused solely by monetary reasons, such as a lack of materials, insufficient production, and high costs. However, in most countries, currency plays an important role, so preventing inflation should be the top priority. However, in some countries, the internal situation is unstable and it is not easy to do so for a while, so it is necessary to find ways to provide relief during this transition period. The stability and other issues in the world must be resolved before it is possible to hope for stable exchange rates and international investment.</p>
<h3>Hardware Prices Rise in a Straight Line</h3>
<p>Since rumors of foreign exchange caused prices to change, guest gangs have been purchasing in large quantities, resulting in a shortage of spot goods. Steel plate prices were very sluggish because there was a rumor that the remaining materials from the Japanese remnant birds would be shipped to China. Most parts and hardware are produced by the factory, and the trip to the factory is affected by work and sales, forming a straight line rise.</p>
<h3>Industrial Raw Materials Fall</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the black market for US dollars stabilized slightly. Industrial raw materials fell, and transactions were also sparse. The price of caustic soda, which had risen to 800,000 yuan per barrel three days ago, has fallen to 690,000 yuan. Other items such as soda ash and bleaching powder have also fallen. Vanillin and white alkali have arrived in large quantities, and prices have not improved. Water glass, which once rose to less than 100 yuan per pound, has recently risen to 140 yuan per pound, but the cost of foreign orders is 250 yuan per pound.</p>
<h3>Chinese Stocks Tired First, Then Good, Closing Prices High</h3>
<p>Chinese stocks did not see strong trading yesterday, but new buyers joined in. However, transactions were limited. The machine surface gang suddenly panicked in the middle, and the situation was very unfavorable. Each stock was slightly firm at the morning opening, and there was a northern plate in. However, at this time, the Ying gang sold high, and soon the board was small at high prices. The mid-way trading piano was quiet, and the machine surface gang was uneasy, and the situation was extremely difficult for an hour. It was not until 11:30 that a ray of light appeared. The Guangdong gang first came to maintain Yong yarn, and the securities gang also purchased Meyer. There were a lot of rebounds on the machine surface, and the situation gradually improved. Around 5 o'clock, the financial gang also came to force purchases. The buying intention gradually increased, and they rose sharply, making high prices in the short-selling market, and the ground was tired after closing. As a result, Yong Yarn, Meyer, Jingfu, and Xinguang stocks were all about half good compared to the previous closing. Among the cold stocks, Tongyi, Huafeng, and Yong Cement were still slightly lower, Rongjian Xian was flat, China Textile rose by a little less than 10%, and the rest all rose slightly. The total transaction volume was about 780,000 shares, and the rise and fall of off-market stocks were small.</p>

Other aged teas such as Chou Zhen, Zhen Mei, Fujian Xiao Zhong, and aged Wen Hong tea are being significantly purchased by Yong Fa, Xinhua, Hua Cha Wang Yu Tai, and Yuan Li. Internal sales of black and green tea remain consistent, but due to the rain, transactions in Shui Street shops and those in the Suzhou and Wuxi areas have not increased.</p>
<h3>Wool and Textile Industry Requests Exemption from Commodity Tax; Tianjin Counterparts Send Letters in Support</h3>
<p>The Municipal Wool and Textile Dyeing Industry Association believes that the widespread use and high tax rates on wool fabrics and wool products are beyond the capacity of various factories to bear. The association requests that the government make a decision to reduce the burden, or at least postpone the implementation. The association recently received letters from counterparts in Tianjin, who also unanimously advocate for a joint approach to address the issue, fearing that the entire wool textile industry will collapse under the pressure of foreign goods dumping.</p>
<h3>Silk and Wool: American Merchants Urge Expedited Exports, Fearing Loss to Other Countries</h3>
<p>[United Press Washington, 16th] The U.S. agricultural delegation to China stated today that both the production and the purchase volume of Chinese silk and wool can be greatly improved. However, difficulties may arise due to increased costs, transportation delays, and recent exchange rate fluctuations. The agricultural delegation recently held a ten-day meeting with commercial representatives from Shanghai, advocating for taking advantage of the current market opportunities to immediately purchase large quantities of silk and wool to supply the American market, fearing that otherwise, it will be seized by other countries.</p>

<h3>On the Friendship Between Wang Anshi and Su Shi</h3>
<p>— Fa Wei Hong</p>
<p>"Women scorn women," which is of course not a normal phenomenon in the literary world. As for "politics overshadowing friendship," that is even more so when women insist on confining themselves to a "narrow cage," so why bother to say it's normal! Mr. Zhongming said it well: "Literary friends need to have broad minds and not hate each other because of differences in political positions or opinions. Don't expect your literary friends to all be your comrades. You must be able to accommodate literary friends from all parties." (See the article "Literary Friendship and Political Relations" in the September 11 issue of this publication.) Therefore, I am reminded of the friendship between Wang Anshi and Su Shi, which did not change due to differences in political positions or opinions.</p>
<p>Everyone knows that Su Shi was one of the most vigorous critics of Wang Anshi's New Policies. When he was the magistrate of Kaifeng Prefecture in the fourth year of the Xining reign of Emperor Shenzong of Song, he submitted a memorial criticizing the New Policies as inconvenient. Later, the censor Xie Jingwen used another matter to impeach Su Shi, and Su Shi was transferred to Hangzhou as a judge. Su Shi was repeatedly demoted and suffered many hardships thereafter, all related to his criticism of the New Policies. From a political standpoint, they were on opposite sides. But they did not change their friendship because of this, and they admired each other's literary and artistic achievements. Let's look at the following records:</p>
<p>"When Dongpo wrote the Stele for the Temple of Loyalty, Jinggong placed it in the corner. A guest asked, 'Does Prime Minister like this person's work?' Jinggong said, 'This is very much like the Western Han.' The guest praised him endlessly. Jinggong smiled and said, 'Who in the Western Han can compare?' Some guests compared him to Sima Xiangru and Yang Xiong. Jinggong said, 'Xiangru's 'Fu of Sir, Vast and Great,' and his "Letter to Convey Dissuasion from Hunting’ are the greatest works. Xiong's 'Tai Xuan' and 'Fa Yan' are based on the Book of Changes, but I have not seen him narrate events and gaze like this. He should be allowed to gallop up and down with Zichang, like the Chronicles of the Princes and Kings since the Chu-Han period!'" [Pan Zizhen's Shihua]</p>
<p>"When Shu Wang was at Zhongshan, a guest came from Huangzhou. Gong said, 'What wonderful words has Dongpo said recently?' The guest said, 'Dongpo stayed overnight at the Linfu Pavilion, woke up from a drunken dream, and wrote a record of the scenic spots of Chengdu, more than a thousand words, finalizing only one or two words. There is a handwritten copy, which is left in the boat. Gong sent someone to fetch it. At that time, there was a forest shadow on the ground coming from the southeast. Gong unfolded and read it under the windy eaves, and he saw the joy of his eyebrows, saying, 'Zizhan is a dragon among men! However, one word is not stable.' The guest said, 'What do you mean?' Gong said, 'Day by day wins poverty, it is better to say like good gamblers, day by day loses.' Dongpo heard this, clapped his hands and laughed loudly, and also regarded Gong as a knowledgeable person." [Hui Hong's Leng Zhai Yehua]</p>
<p>"When Dongpo was in Huangzhou, he wrote a poem about snow: 'Frozen and coalesced jade vest rises millet, light shakes silver sea dazzling flowers.' People do not know that he used allusions. Later, he moved to Ruhai, passed Jinling, and saw Wang Jinggong to discuss poetry and said this: 'Taoists use the two shoulders as jade vests, and the eyes as silver seas, is this what you are using?' Dongpo laughed at it. He retreated and said to Ye Zhiyuan, 'How can those who learn from Jinggong be so knowledgeable!'" [Zhao De Lin's Hou Qinglu]</p>
<p>"All the officials sent lyrics to Guizhixiang in Quangling Huaigu, a total of more than thirty poems, but only Jie Fu's was the most superb. When Dongpo saw it, he couldn't help but sigh, 'This old man is a fox spirit!'" [Yang Ti's Gujin Cihua] How much they cherished each other! This is precisely because they both valued friendship. As for the difference in political positions or opinions, that is another matter and need not be discussed together. Zhu Sheng's Quhu Jiuwen said:</p>
<p>"Dongpo was transferred from Huang to Ru, passed Jinling, and Jinggong wore casual clothes and rode a donkey to visit him at the boat station. Dongpo greeted him without wearing a hat and said, 'I, Shi, dare to see the Prime Minister in casual clothes today.' Jinggong smiled and said, 'Are rituals set up for us?' Dongpo said, 'I also know that you won't use me in your school.' Jinggong was speechless, so he invited him to visit Jiangshan."</p>
<p>Su Shi's words naturally contained thorns, but they were still tactful, and there was neither anger nor a break in friendship. Isn't this something that the modern literary world can emulate?</p>
<p>Now, I have something else to mention. Later, after Wang Anshi died, the court discussed awarding him the title of Grand Tutor, and Su Shi wrote the imperial edict, praising his great virtue. For example, he said that he "netted the lost texts of the Six Classics, and decided them with his own intention; refined the dross of the hundred schools of thought, and made new this man. During the period of the Xining reign, he crowned the virtuous and was useful, and he was trusted, something that had never happened in ancient or modern times. Just as his achievements were about to be completed, the rebellion began; floating clouds were nothing, and he shed them like they were lost; he repeatedly contended for seats with fishermen and woodcutters, and did not disturb the deer; the occasion of his advance and retreat was admirable." How appropriate this praise is! Chen Shan's Mufeng Xinyu said that this edict was Su Shi's words of long-standing regret, which is a colored-glasses view. After reading this edict and looking at the current literary world, there should be many feelings: Is it true that political relations are more important than friendship, and is it true that ancient and modern people are not related?</p>
<h3>A Record of Artistic Terms</h3>
<p>— Ma Chao Ying</p>
<p>Primitive Art</p>
<p>In English it is Primitive Art. It is the art that occurred in primitive times. The art produced by the fear and doubt of nature, and the fear and praise of God, arising from this state of mind, is primitive art. Also, utilitarian art generally has the characteristics of being naive, clumsy, and simple, and is also called primitive art.</p>
<p>Plastic Arts</p>
<p>In English it is Bildende Kunst. Specifically refers to painting, sculpture, architecture and the art of the sense of touch. This is in contrast to the art of sound and rhythm, such as poetry, music, and dance. This type of art has three characteristics: * Using tangible materials, * Occupying space or a point in space, * Can interact with the visual senses. At the same time, there is a difference between plastic arts and figurative arts (Bildkunst), and spatial art (Art of Space). The former refers specifically to painting and sculpture, while the latter refers to decoration and so on.</p>
<h3>Entering the City (Photography)</h3>

<h3>An Inch of Land, an Inch of Blood 46</h3>
<p>— Ye Jin Feng</p>
<p>Tomorrow! July 27th. The night before, I lay awake all night until dawn, as the artillery fire continued incessantly, only occasionally becoming slightly sparse, but not for long before intensifying again. According to news exchanged from various radio stations, this action was entirely due to the personal opinion of Matsui and a few others, who probably wanted to use this artillery fire to intimidate Song Zheyuan into signing a troop withdrawal agreement; in this way, the Japanese intelligence agents and military leaders stationed in Beiping could make up for their failures.</p>
<p>However, Song was being held by several high-ranking military and political officials in Beiping and Wanping, and he also felt that the Japanese were not giving him enough face, forcing him to sign the withdrawal, which smacked too much of a "treaty under the city walls," so he also wanted to resist the Japanese army.</p>
<p>At dawn on this day, around six o'clock, the Japanese artillery fire suddenly stopped. According to news from Mr. W, the Japanese sent a liaison officer for one last time to request a face-to-face conversation with Song himself, regardless of whether he agreed or refused, as long as he gave his word. This, of course, was rejected again. According to news from the Shen Staff Headquarters, this last envoy contact was ordered by the headquarters; if Matsui and others did not comply, they would face severe punishment. Matsui, being cunning, feigned compliance, only sending two or three lower-ranking adjutants and attendants to the Jinde Society's headquarters, loitering for a while before leaving and returning to the office, saying that "the Chinese side has formally refused." Matsui then reported this.</p>
<p>As soon as this "report" was sent in code, the artillery fire resumed. Immediately following, twelve planes took off in four groups and dropped bombs indiscriminately on the suburbs of Beiping and the vicinity of Wanping. This was neither strategic bombing nor positional bombing; if one had to give it a name, it could probably be called "terror bombing," because the bombs were dropped with too little aim, and most of the destroyed buildings were temples, schools, and residences; nine out of ten people killed were innocent civilians. After the bombing, they added strafing, and after the strafing, it was back to bombing, until the bombs and bullets were used up before they retreated. All that remained in the bombed areas were piles of rubble and ashes, and scattered limbs and bones. The cries of mothers calling for their sons and fathers calling for their children were truly tragic and heart-wrenching.</p>
<p>On this day, the people of Ping, Wan, and Qu passed the day in terror under the fire of cannons and planes, clinging to their lives. The strangest thing was that despite the turmoil, the Japanese army remained on their own positions, not advancing a single step, and our side, not having received an attack order, naturally did not attack, only firing a few shots at them from the artillery, just going through the motions. The evening was relatively calm. Perhaps this was the momentary calm before a huge storm.</p>
<p>With frequent telecommunications, I went to Dingyuan's place twice in the morning and evening. Because of the ground-shaking artillery fire all night, he had another sleepless night, and only slept for two or three hours in the early morning. The daytime air raids made him uneasy, and he was not as spirited as the day before. I told them that I had already spoken with Mr. W on the phone about the situation in Changxindian, and explained the issue of their family participating in military work. Mr. W expressed great agreement and promised to proceed immediately.</p>
<p>According to Mr. W's opinion, this matter did not seem to be a problem and they could join at any time; that is to say, their family could enlist whenever they were ready, and even join the Wanping garrison's Xingwen Corps nearby for temporary work, which was also a viable option. But Dingyuan's opinion was that they must first identify a corps, complete the formal appointment procedures, and participate formally according to regulations. This was the obstruction of a long-standing habit of English gentleman style. During our two meetings, we made this issue the focus of our conversation.</p>
<h3>Record of Sichuan Mountain and Water Paintings</h3>
<p>— Zhao Jing Shen</p>
<p>I am a native of Yibin, Sichuan, but I have never been to Sichuan. The year before last, when I went to the rear, I had already arrived in Lihuang, Anhui, and I wanted to enter Sichuan from Henan and Shaanxi, but unfortunately the Pinghan Railway was cut off, and I still could not go to see the place where my ancestors were. However, these two days have given me compensation, and that is the national exhibition of Quan Wu Guanggfu and Wu Yingbao.</p>
<p>Coincidentally, Mr. Wu Guangfu had also been to our Yibin, and left traces: "A Scene of the Taoist Temple in the River in Yibin" and "Pigeon House in Yibin". In the former, water flows between the two mountains. It is said that the water is very rapid, merges with the river water, and creates torrents, washing between the rocks and flowing in circles, showing Mr. Wu's specialty of viewing water. The way he paints the water flow is different from the average person, and it can be said that he has created his own style. The latter is located in the high mountains, with two Buddha statues sculpted in the rocks. The water flows rapidly under the mountain, and three boatmen (the "boatmen" that Ye Shengtao spoke of) are working hard to prop up a sailboat. I had the drawing outlined and kept as a souvenir.</p>
<p>I read Fan Chengda's Travels to Mount Emei, and the cloud scenery made me yearn for it so much that I couldn't wait to go and enjoy that kind of realm myself. Now that I have seen Mr. Wu's (Mount Emei's Golden Summit Cloud Color), I know that what Fan Chengda described was not false. That kind of vast and boundless scenery is indeed great and magnificent, but Mr. Wu's brushwork is sufficient to support it.</p>
<p>Mr. Wu's paintings imitate Shi Tao a lot, and he likes this old bitter gourd's landscape paintings the most. In addition, he also imitated Song Huizong, Mi Fu, Lu Baoshan, and Jin Dongxin. But he copied the works of various masters, but he was not bound by them. Mr. Wu is still Mr. Wu after all. Sometimes he boldly breaks through the traditional patterns of Chinese painting, and only paints half of the boat or people at the end, like this method of cutting off at the waist, the ancients may have regarded it as a taboo. ("Gorge Boat" and "Great Emei Jieyin Temple"). He also did not hesitate to add mountain shadows to "Jialing Dawn Raft". His special method of painting water is especially his proud work, he painted the water alive!</p>
<p>Mr. Wu's paintings left a deep impression on me, and in my personal feeling, the best works are still the following: "Autumn Colors of Stream and Mountain" and "Cloud Colors of Great Emei" are both delicate and elegant. "Yuanming's Leisurely Mood" depicts Tao Qian drinking wine, with a waiter supporting him. The waiter is painted the best, with his eyes staring straight, as if he is working very hard. I have seen the calligraphy and painting photos of the London exhibition in the Commercial Press edition. The original face of Zhou Yuzhi's waiter was not fully revealed. Far inferior to Mr. Wu's painting. "Spring Mountain Ruisong" is sparse and well-proportioned, with a very design-like flavor. "Shu Mountain Travelers" and "Guiyang Huaji Ling Mountain" are both excellent works of realism. The former depicts towering mountains and ridges, high and shading the sun, and the latter depicts the scenery of Ling Mountain, making people linger. There is also a painting "Shiming Qingxiang Green Landscape," the shadowy small boat and the chaotic mountain colors are dim, which reminds me of the return journey to Hangzhou Xixi that time. I said to Yao Fu: "This one can be said to be the scenery of dusk, right? Like Monet's painting of haystacks, we are reluctant to call the bright mountain color the daytime, and the dark mountain color the dusk, what do you think?" He also nodded casually. I don't care whether he agrees or not, anyway, I have already enjoyed it with relish.</p>
<p>Mr. Wang Yingbao's paintings are not as strong as Yao Fu's in terms of color, but he is more inclined to the meticulous aspect than Yao Fu. His paintings are also often smaller than Yao Fu's, and sometimes the narrow vertical or narrow horizontal strips also have a special charm. General appreciators especially appreciate his waterfalls, and what he paints are all waterfalls. He also inscribed poems on the paintings, but the title of the painting is also a excerpt from the poem. In this way, except for letting us know that he painted it in Chongqing Zhangyuan or Hexiang Caotang, we don't know what place he painted, and it is not as interesting as Yan Dingming's note of Wushan Gorge. I guess that he probably paints more of the freehand style than the realistic style, the composition may be more complete than Yao Fu, but the sense of reality or obvious personality seems to be relatively less. But he did not completely disappoint me, because he had clearly noted a Qingcheng Mountain in the style of Zhang Daqian; my purpose is probably to especially focus on certain special landscapes of Shu Mountain, such as Yao Fu's Giant Buddha Rock. In the past, Zong Shaowen traveled to the Five Mountains, and thanked Mr. Wu Guangfu, now I can be said to be "standing-traveling" in the mountains and rivers of Sichuan.</p>

<h3>White Criminals</h3>
<p>— Shao Fu</p>
<p>Now some people call friends who specialize in riding in white cars to watch free shows "white criminals", this term is quite elegant. It is said that in Fuzhou, in order to rectify social mores, the authorities once mobilized the military, police, and gendarmerie on a large scale, arrested more than 100 of these white people, men and women, and punished them by using several large trucks to take them in white cars once more in the evening, and sending them to the suburbs sixty miles away to release them, and let them run back to the city. That night was a night of great wind and rain, and it is said that these characters walked back to the city crying and weeping all night.</p>
<p>Thinking about the scene at that time is indeed a ridiculous and comical scene! This method of punishment, I don't know which master of humor came up with, to be honest, it is very interesting.</p>
<p>I often think that there are many administrative punishments in China that are full of human touch, and the method of dealing with these friends who ride in white cars to watch free shows is one example. Some people say that this method is somewhat frivolous and abusive, but in fact it is very interesting!</p>
<p>There are also quite a few white friends in Shanghai who ride in white cars to watch free shows, I am afraid that the authorities have not yet come up with a more appropriate method. The method of sending them to the suburbs for release in Fuzhou seems to be able to be emulated, but it is best to release them to Pudong and let them cross the Huangpu River to see the long river, but in this way, both land and water are dispatched, which is also a huge project.</p>
<p>News Data</p>
<h3>Gazelle People and Others</h3>
<p>— Mi Shan</p>
<p>Recently, the "Gazelle People" discovered in the outer deserts have become excellent news items for various newspapers. The characteristics of the so-called "Gazelle People" are: first, their actions and calls are like those of gazelles, they only eat green grass and do not eat ordinary food, but they are clearly "people"; second, they run extremely fast, being able to run fifty miles per hour, which is more than two and a half times the world record for the 100-yard dash, but this "Gazelle Person" is only fifteen years old.</p>
<p>After this news spread, people all over the world found it very interesting, and natural scientists and medical scientists also encountered unprecedented problems. British people said, "I hope to urge him to attend the next World Games."</p>
<p>Several years ago, in the "Luogan" area of Sumatra, an animal that looked like a human and like a monkey was also discovered. The local natives called him "Guman." His height was only about one meter, his eyes were bright, he walked as fast as lightning, and he would run away immediately when he saw people, disappearing in an instant. His lifestyle was exactly like that of apes and monkeys, but his physiological form was clearly human. If we infer according to the current name of "Gazelle People," then that kind of person can be called "Ape-Monkey People."</p>
<p>"Gazelle People" and "Ape-Monkey People" are all formed by being influenced by living in animal groups since childhood, affecting their lifestyle and actions, and due to physiological peculiarities or abnormalities, forming strange "special figures." Here is a note:</p>
<p>Strange</p>
<p>In 1935, a commercial painter in Chicago, USA, named Sam Becker, had a big change in his body: his head suddenly swelled three times, his neck shortened and was "eliminated", his body bent, his legs were bent, his arms stretched out and were thin, and his body shortened day by day; what's even better is that he felt a strange pain and itching between his buttocks at the end of his spine, and the doctor determined that a tail would grow there, and he was very likely to become an ape-monkey. Unfortunately, this Becker died soon; he did not live to see a "fresh and alive" ape-monkey come to create the new law that "ape-monkeys evolved from humans".</p>
<p>It is not uncommon for newborn babies to have strange shapes. In the twenty-third year of the Republic of China, a boy was born in the Shao family in Yingzhou, Anhui. His body was covered with golden hair, the color was bright, and the buttocks were especially abundant. Just in July this year, a woman in Nagano Prefecture, Japan, gave birth to a girl with two faces, four arms, and four legs, completely connected together above the buttocks. (According to the Changchun Xinsheng Daily on August 30, a woman also gave birth to such a freak.</p>
<p>Double Brain</p>
<p>Australia has a young man named Wilkinson who was born with a "double brain." He can write letters, draw pictures, or write essays with both his left and right hands at the same time, the contents are completely different, and he can think about two different questions at the same time without confusion. Local companies and agencies are vying to hire him, because one person can do the work of two people.</p>
<p>From the "Gazelle People", I quickly wrote about some special phenomena of human beings. These special phenomena all need to be studied in detail by general scientists.</p>
<h3>Announcement of Winning Couplets</h3>
<p>— You Tai</p>
<p>Editor's note: A British reporter said that the Hong Kong issue is like "a wave in a teacup," and we can't help but feel it; so we asked readers to reply to it with a second line. Many readers responded, and here are the most obvious and profound ones. As for whether the couplets themselves are precise or whether the tones are correct, it is not important, the main thing is to take their meaning.</p>
<p>(1) "The snoring beside the bed" (unbearable) — Zhong Qiu</p>
<p>(2) "The bacteria on rotten feet" (Hong Kong feet, be careful of spreading!) — Wu Guangxiang</p>
<p>(3) "The embers in the opium pipe" (please check history) — Qi Shi</p>
<p>(4) "The white worms on the top hat" (referring to the top hats of gentlemen) — Wen</p>
<p>The rest will not be listed one by one, and we can only let it be "a pearl left in the sea!" — Editorial Office</p>
<h3>"Teachers" You Tai</h3>
<p>The so-called "teachers" are like this:</p>
<p>Elementary school teaches "death" (teachers),</p>
<p>Middle school teaches "resentment" (teaching staff),</p>
<p>University teaches "sorrow" (professors).</p>
<h3>From the Death of the Tank Inventor, Discussing the Birth of the Tank</h3>
<p>— Jin Xia</p>
<p>According to a London dispatch, Sir Tritton, the inventor of the tank (knighted by the British royal family for his meritorious invention), passed away at his home in Lincoln on the 24th of this month, at the age of seventy-one. Counting back, he was exactly forty years old when he invented the tank. Regarding his personal "achievement," we are not in a position to say anything; because what he invented was a tool of war. Here, we only introduce to readers some stories about the birth of the tank, which is very interesting common knowledge.</p>
<p>Far back in the 15th century, during the Renaissance in Europe, there was an artist, Leonardo da Vinci, who wrote in a text his fantasy: "I am working on designing a war chariot fully clad in iron armor, sturdy and impenetrable; when driving it, firing guns and cannons to charge into the enemy ranks, no matter how powerful the enemy army, they will have to collapse, and the infantry behind it can safely advance straight in." At the time, in Leonardo's mind, it was only the fantasy of a scholar, but unexpectedly, he became a most accurate prophet: he uttered the functional structure of the greatest weapon on land, born more than four hundred and thirty years later.</p>
<p>Madman's Rant</p>
<p>From 1911 to 1914, several engineers in England submitted plans of something similar to a tank to the War Office; currently, these documents are still stored in the files of the British War Office, with the annotation "This is a madman's rant!" added on top.</p>
<p>When the First European War broke out, the Allied forces and the German army were locked in a stalemate on the banks of the Somme River in France. Although the battle line extended west to the North Sea, the German defenses were solid, and the Allied forces could not break through. At that time, Colonel Swinton was assigned to the French General Headquarters as an observer. He believed that to break the deadlock of trench warfare, it was necessary to use a war chariot that could not be deterred by bullets, could cross trenches, and was equipped with quick-firing guns; he returned to China in October 1914 and presented this idea to the General Headquarters. This proposal was seen by Churchill, then the Minister of the Navy, who gave it special support. The following year, the British Ministry of War and the Admiralty jointly formed a joint committee to conduct research. On September 19, a model exhibition was held in Lincoln. The design of the model made by the committee was not exactly the same as the original. Swinton thought it was a failure; later, the wooden model designed specifically by Tritton and his assistant Captain Wilson was tested, and it fully met the actual conditions: (1) it could climb over obstacles five feet high, (2) it could cross trenches eight feet wide. Therefore, the British authorities decided to build according to that model.</p>
<p>Secret Test</p>
<p>In the summer of 1916, this new weapon was secretly tested in the UK. On the morning of September 15 of the same year, it was used in combat in the Somme region of France. When the German army saw this huge monster for the first time, they were shocked and retreated in defeat.</p>
<p>As for the origin of the name "tank," it was because the British authorities, in order to avoid attracting attention, put the completed new weapon in a box and sealed it, with "Tank" (meaning "water tank") marked on the outside, so as not to arouse suspicion.</p>
<p>The German army originally did not have tanks, but in May 1917, they had successfully copied them and confronted the Allied forces.</p>
<p>Early tanks had many shortcomings. Military experts criticized them, saying that tanks had three diseases: "lame, mute, blind." Because at that time, the tank's speed was only three or four miles per hour, there was no communication, and the observation holes were narrow. However, when it appeared in the Second World War, its power greatly increased, becoming the king of the land, with a speed increased to thirty miles per hour, wireless communication and command, and various types: amphibious, flamethrower, light, medium, heavy tanks, etc.</p>
<p>Although we have now reached the atomic age, tanks are still important weapons in land warfare.</p>
<p>News Figures</p>
<h3>Veteran Anti-Japanese General Ma Zhanshan</h3>
<p>— Chong Zhen</p>
<p>General Ma Zhanshan is China's first anti-Japanese general. As early as 1934, he stood on the icy and snowy banks of the Nenjiang Bridge, boldly firing the first bullet of "resistance" at the Japanese invaders. This old general, now sixty-two years old, has never left the anti-Japanese post from that time until now. During the eight years of the War of Resistance, he sat in Halahai, in the cracks between Shaanxi, Shanxi, and Sui provinces, struggling with the stubborn Japanese invaders; however, in recent years, he seemed to be buried in the wind and sand. Many people cared about him, and many people forgot about him. A few days ago, the newspaper suddenly revealed his new appointment. Now, he is the Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Northeast Security.</p>
<p>Grew up in a Farmer's Family</p>
<p>Looking back to his birth: it was in 1885 in the home of a farmer in Huai District, Liaoning Province. When he was young, he liked to practice martial arts and was full of heroic thoughts. At the age of thirteen, he could shoot with both hands, hitting the target nine out of ten times, and was also proficient in horsemanship. This was also the environment that cultivated him into such a martial figure. He was extremely filial to his mother, day after day for decades. If his mother was sick, he would personally take care of her. He was sincere and frank in making friends. If others were in trouble, he would do his best to help them, especially if strangers asked him for help, he would be even more generous. Therefore, although the general has held important positions for decades, he is still very poor.</p>
<p>In his decades of military career, he has always adhered to the spirit of Jiang Taigong guarding the law and avenging grievances, engaging in arduous anti-Japanese work. During the War of Resistance, people often had a legendary myth about him, saying that he had disappeared, and saying that he was in battle. In fact, he was always just like that.</p>
<p>When the Lugou Bridge Incident broke out, he immediately went to Nanjing to ask for instructions and met with Chairman Chiang. At that time, he was appointed Commander-in-Chief of the Northeast Advance Army. In mid-October of that year, his troops participated in the virgin battle to defend Gui Sui in a semi-mature state. He tried his best to serve the country. Later, although he was forced to retreat, he himself was the last one to withdraw. He took the last train to leave Gui Sui. Subsequently, in the enemy's winter mopping-up campaign, he led his troops to fight hard in the north and south, establishing extraordinary achievements. In 1939, he also wanted to lead his troops to the east to fight back to Heilongjiang. Under extremely difficult circumstances, he rushed to the western border of Rehe, but in the smooth progress, he encountered complex environmental encirclements and attacks everywhere. He seemed to be bound. During the "February 3rd" Yimeng Incident in 1943, he quietly guarded an empty city, and finally did not allow the enemy to succeed, but turned danger into safety, protecting that great city.</p>
<p>Great Ambition and Aspiration</p>
<p>He often thought to himself: "I can lead brave soldiers across the Chahar steppe and directly attack Heilongjiang, igniting every corner!" However, this ideal did not become a reality, and his great ambition and aspiration could only lurk deep in his heart, waiting for that day to fight back to the Northeast. Finally, the War of Resistance was won, and General Ma looked towards the Northeast with a smile, but the Northeast was again subjected to international "robbery" and the internal conflict ignited by a third party. This disappointed General Ma too much!</p>
<p>After the victory, he was willing to hand over the fourteen guerrilla teams into two divisions (20,000 people) to the country. Because he himself was old and should retire, letting the younger generation and up-and-coming military officers take on new tasks. But the current situation prevents him from retiring.</p>
<p>Although General Ma is an old general in his sixties, he is still constantly learning. He always reads a lot of books every day, especially the most important news in the newspapers. He likes to talk, his mouth surpasses his pen. When he is talking vigorously, he will light a cigarette, which is his most energetic shot.</p>
<p>Today, he has been transferred to the post of Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Northeast Security. When the people of the Northeast saw this old general return to the Northeast, it was like an old village elder returning to his hometown after many years. Their hearts are pure. I believe that all compatriots in China must also be concerned about this old general.</p>
<p>From the Northeast issue, I thought of General Ma Zhanshan, and from General Ma Zhanshan, I thought of this battered Oriental Balkans, which is full of emotion!</p>
