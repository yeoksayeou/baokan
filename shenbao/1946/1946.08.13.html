<h3>廬山夏令營紀念週　主席訓示建國要義　把握時機實行規律生活</h3>
<p>〔本報牯嶺十二日電〕蔣主席十二日下午五時半在官邸舉行茶會，召見中委賀衷寒，柳克述，李敬齋，谷正綱，賴璉，鄧文儀，袁守謙，中宣部主任秘書盧祺新，夏令營副主任劉健羣。十三日起至十五日止，每日下午四時廿分至五時廿分，主席將親臨夏令營，舉行學員點名，侮日一大隊或三大隊。</p>
<p>〔本報牯嶺十二日電〕蔣主席十二日晨九時親臨夏令營，主持紀念週訓話，其他出席者有陳總長誠，蔣教育長經國及該營全體長官，學員等九百餘人，行禮如儀後，主席即開始訓話，詞意約分三點：（一）把握時機，八年堅苦抗戰，雖已過去，但今後建國事業，比八年抗戰更為艱難。勝利至今，又已有一年，在此一年中，受盡種種磨難，然我們相信歷史是不容磨滅的，而這一時機，乃五十年來最艱苦的時期，但亦是很難得的機會。以前未曾有過，以後亦不會再有，所以我們必須把握這機會，對國家貢獻，即在此時。（一）今後建國計劃，總理遺敎中已明白闡述，毋需複述，今天要勉勵各位者，乃要希望依照總理遺敎，脚踏實地去做。（三）生活須有規律，刻苦耐勞，節儉樸實，我國所以不能自強，即因一般官僚習氣太濃，腐敗奢靡，要知節約重於生產，奢侈腐敗，乃滅國因素，我本人在生活方面，願作各位表率，希望大家都能做到。生活無規律，非但不能成家立業，且根本不能做人。</p>
<p>〔本報牯嶺十二日電〕陳果夫，陳立夫，十二日下午四時許由京來牯，應夏令營講學。</p>
<p>〔中央社牯嶺十二日電〕甘主席谷正倫，十二日自京抵牯，謁蔣主席述職。</p>
<p>〔中央社南京十二日電〕靑年黨領袖曾琦，偕該黨中央常務委員劉東嚴，十二日上午八時飛潯轉牯嶺，謁蔣主席。聞曾劉二氏，將在廬勾留约一星期即返京。</p>
<h3>美兩使繼續斡旋　與雙方接觸頻繁　周恩來之言出爾反爾</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十二日電〕司徒大使今晨九時往訪馬帥，對周恩來昨夜會談時所表示之態度轉吿馬帥。旋於十時半返大使館，即與兪大維晤談約一小時許，司徒大使離去馬帥行館後，周恩來即於十一時訪馬帥晤談，迄一時許始出。下午馬帥再赴大使館訪司徒大使，至六時三刻始出。七時，俞大維又訪司徒大使，迄八時半始出、政治談商顯又在司馬兩氏之努力下呈現頻繁之接觸。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十二日電〕司徒大使與周恩來之會晤，聞係研討安平事件，至周恩來與馬帥之晤談，則爲周氏就共產黨對司馬兩氏聯合聲明發表後，就共產黨對談判之態度有所表示。</p>
<p>〔聯合社南京十二日電〕司徒大使今午與國防部長白崇禧同餐，據大使稱：同餐時係談「其他事務」，惟一般人士咸認彼等討論蔓延中之內戰事。</p>
<p>據中共代表團方面息：中共對於退出蘇北熱河等五地區一事，不允作任何考慮，堅決表示不予接受。</p>
<p>〔中央社東京十二日電〕東京各報本日上午均以顯明地位，刊載馬歇爾特使及司徒雷登大使之聲明，極其重視其事，並表示失望之意。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十二日電〕昨晚周恩來與司徒晤談時，周曾表示對兩氏之奔走深爲感激，並盼兩氏仍能繼續爲中國之和平而努力。大使即稱：努力於調解爲衷心所願，然仍盼雙方意見接近。並詢以共產黨是否可在某方面作一讓步？周氏表示可予考慮。至是司徒大使乃信和平之門尚未關閉，故司徒於訪馬帥後，決定暫緩赴平，以待商談之機會，然今晚據共產黨辦事處發言人對「可予考慮」四字加以否認，並堅稱絕無考慮之意。</p>
<p>〔中央社南京十二日電〕司徒雷登大使十二日晨單獨接見中央社記者，闡述渠對和平商談之態度。大使稱：「吾人現正期待談判之進展，余將不放棄希望，直至吾人認爲無從爲力爲止。」</p>
<p>〔聯合社南京十二日電〕國民參政會秘書長邵力子，今日在此間向聯合社談稱：希望馬歇爾特使繼續斡旋，促成中國和平。一俟國共爭議解決，美軍即應退出中國，因屆時在華美軍使命，已吿完成。彼以爲美國援助國府，並不使內戰延長，惟中國必須解決內爭，否則「恐有經濟毀滅」可能。</p>
<h3>周恩來說</h3>
<p>要安理會來調停</p>
<p>〔聯合社南京十二日電〕此間晚報今日傳周恩來稱：除非美國調人能解決中國內部問題，否則中共將要求聯合國機構安全理事會調停。此說未獲證實，中共發言人對此，拒不置評。</p>
<h3>吳稚暉墜床　決放棄牯遊</h3>
<p>李石會應邀抵牯</p>
<p>〔中央社牯嶺十二日電〕中委李石曾，段錫朋，葉秀學，十二日下午二時半抵牯，據李氏語記者，余與稚老（吳稚暉）奉蔣主席邀，來牯消夏，因候稚老病愈，遲未首途。前晚稚老忽自床上跌至地下，決心放棄牯遊，余祗得一人應召上山。並謂余近日正埋頭緻編世界學典，絕少聞問外事。</p>
<h3>陳部長抵牯嶺談話　商談前途仍樂觀　但必須先除云威脅因素</h3>
<p>〔中央社牯嶺十二日電〕「和平商談前途仍然樂觀」，此爲中央組織部長陳立夫於十二日抵牯後與記者提出「對馬歇爾特使向司徒雷登大使聯合聲明之反應」一問時所作答覆。記者又問何以見得，陳氏答，以政治方式解決國內紛爭，政府以之爲目的，依照中共中央政治局之決議十九日來，中共似以之爲手段，祗要目的尚無變動時，則手段亦尚可延用一時，所以商談仍然爲樂觀，但望中共改手段爲目的，則雙方爲同一目的而努力，自然一天可比一天接近。問：和平商談因何不能獲致協議？答：威脅和平有二因素，（一）交通不恢復，（二）軍隊不整編，欲求和平，必先去其威脅之因素，如能採用較科學之方法，以白紙黑字寫明何段交通何日修復通車，何處軍隊何日集中何地整編，雙方依照規定執行，則第三者即可判斷是非曲直，否則空口說白話，東拉西扯，評判者無所依據，以作判斷。天天說和平，而不從去除和平之威脅因素下功夫，徒費時間而已，但拖延時間或正爲共產黨所企求者。問：蘇北共軍退出後，地方行政性質問題，部長有何意見？部長笑語記者曰，蘇北因共黨決堤，行將陸沉，人民都不能生存，地方行政性質，恐已不成問題了。記者最後又問，周恩來有無復信？部長答無，並稱，共產黨在國內外報紙刊物，已動員向我進攻，足足三年，我從未反攻過一次，因爲最近周恩來公開向中外新聞記者誣衊我太甚，所以不得不反攻一下，我依然希望共產黨從速改變能度、立誠守信，勿視世人都很愚笨，可以玩弄，須知上帝不會保佑一個老是說謊的人。</p>
<h3>商談歷程如登牯嶺</h3>
<p>羅家倫談話</p>
<p>〔中央社牯嶺十二日電〕馬司聯合聲明發表後，記者曾往訪在牯之前中大校長羅家倫，前川大校長程天放，前西北大學校長賴　，徵詢其意見，僉認從聯合聲明中，吾人至佩兩氏爲中國和平奔走之徒勞。聯合聲明乃爲報道和平商談之現况及其困難癥結所在，以兩氏之熱情與耐心、必能繼續完成其使命，羅氏並謂：以余在牯嶺，余可舉一例以說明，和平商談之歷程，如登牯嶺，祗走百來步，似覺容易，及至中途，漸感困難，將到山頂，正苦疲乏無力之時，晴朗的氣候和蔚藍的天空，正在那裏歡迎我們呢。</p>

<h3>蘇蒙共軍事協定　已在張家口訂立</h3>
<p>〔本報北平十二日電〕根據消息靈通人士所獲情報，張家口方面，已與蘇蒙訂立軍事性質之協定，蘇蒙軍將予該區共軍以軍事援助，並在內蒙某數地區駐兵。據該情報稱：五月上旬，（約爲五月八九日）蘇蒙軍事使節團一行五人，由蘇玉哈瑪夫將軍率領，計有外蒙外長哈瑪索諾，及助長外交官那納飽，譯官爾材沁蘆母等，到張家口後，即舉行軍事協定會議。共方出席者有聶榮臻·宋劭文，內蒙方面有雲澤·奎據·索登那木·雲龍薩不·丕勒諾爾布等列席，商討內外蒙軍事互助，及駐地劃分等問題。經協定如下：（一）長城區外，蘇蒙軍以三師兵力四萬五千餘人，長期駐防多倫諾爾旗，平定堡，東西烏珠穆沁斯王府，東阿山哈迹爾旗王府，匣德（即嘉卜寺）濕江，大　，並在木魯臺，四子部落旗王府，並內外蒙接壤各孔道，（二）察錫兩盟蒙漢民丁，由蘇蒙同時訓練，（三）新軍訓練由蘇蒙配發現代新式裝配：（四）遇軍事行動必要時，即增防察烏兩盟地境管內：（五）察綏蒙管內共產軍武器，由蘇蒙補給，主持訓練，並指定駐地：（六）蒙旗各王公，須接受蘇蒙軍政顧問及聯絡官三至五人。該協定聶榮臻宋劭文已簽署，惟雲澤及奎墟等以蒙古王公認爲與內蒙獨立之條件不相符合，當時並未簽字，允召開內蒙各盟旗王公協商，表決後再行補簽。五月十日，蘇蒙代表離張垣後，雲澤等在聶榮臻慫恿之下，亦未履行內蒙王公會議，並遭聶朱指斥，認雲澤在使節團議席上之動議，有意破壞共蘇友好關係。其後，十六日復派徐某為專使，訪問外蒙主席捐巴拉桑，蘇駐外蒙大使伊凡諾爾夫，商討蘇共軍事互助及駐地劃分問題，廿三日返張垣。廿九日蘇蒙使節團並增加外蒙內政部次長托勒　克，抵張垣後，即舉行會議，列席者計有察盟八旗，錫盟五部，烏盟六旗代表，到有雲澤·奎據·克力更松津·旺楚克烏蘭·田協安·柴嘉牙爾圖·巴丹索特那松·扎瑪單包崇·新欠戶·索登那松；雲龍薩松·丕勤諾爾布·武洛吉那生·及嶺凍文等，決議如下：（一）同第一次決議，惟蘇蒙境暫不設防：（二）劃分蘇軍駐地及軍事援助等內容，（甲）蘇軍駐地自多倫諾爾·北方上都河·平定堡·由瑪　蓋廟·嘉卜寺·土木魯台四子部落·錫拉木倫河等，亦以北蒙民駐地軍事設防；（乙）遇必要時，軍事援助察境；（丙）薩凌河設防。開會共三日，至六月四日，該團飛返庫倫。</p>
<h3>調查安平事件　美軍書面報告</h3>
<p>小組決定會外研究</p>
<p>〔本報北平十二日電〕調查安平事件之廿五小組，十二日長循例舉行會議，亦循例無結果而散。對於調查程序，美方委員饒伯森雖已擬定，並徵得政府委員鄭介民同意，但共方委員葉劍英對其中若干點尚須補充意見，並請示周恩來，故三委員迄未予廿五小組以具體指示。本日開會時，戴維斯仍希望能聽取海軍陸戰隊報吿，波府代表張叔衡亦認爲，聽取陸戰隊報吿爲將來任何調畫程序中不可或缺之一項，爲節省時間，最好及早聽取。中共代表黃逸峯，則恐小組不肯至「解放區」聽取中共報吿，形成缺席判決形勢，故在程序未決定前，仍不催促聽取陸戰隊報吿，結果決定會外分別研究陸戰隊書面報吿。</p>

<p>〔中央社南京十二日電〕中樞紀念週，十二日晨在國府禮堂舉行，白崇禧主席，薜篤弼報吿水利機構改組情形及水利事業進行概况，尤對全國關注最切之黃河復堤堵口一事作極爲詳盡之說明。略謂：黃河復堤堵口，預定一年完成工程開始進行之後雖獲聯總及地方當局民衆之熱忱協助，但由於共黨之一再阻撓，初則迫使測勘工作無法順利進行，繼則使工程開始日期延至本年三月，且於進展過程中，遭受重大阻滯，一度幾部計劃陷於停頓。目前雖經宋院長之堅定主張及聯總之鼓勵協助，繼續開工，但因洪水泛期已屆，最樂觀估計，亦須至本年年終，此一全國水利事業之主管大員，於渠一再列舉共黨蓄意破壞黃河整修工程之種種實例時，內心似充滿憤恨。</p>

<h3>蘇北共軍施暴政　分配土地用非刑　出田受者莫不股慄</h3>
<p>〔中央社本市訊〕據蘇北興化來客議：共軍在興化積極支配土地，每口授田三畝，惟須領得「民主政府」官契，方能實受，其領契稅值，已與出價田相等，但普通農民，又不能不履行所謂「法定手續」，盡其所有餘蓄，以供「民主政府」正稅之需，「民主政府」對於原有一般田主，爲取得田之產權，迫令將其所持田產契約，完全託出，當衆焚燬，以堅計口受田者之信念，如田主不從，則由共軍幹部將共押至田之所在地，當衆審訊，迫取契約。即將田主郷送烈日之下曝晒，又裹以厚棉被，務使如火益熱而後已，非刑虐待，實開中國刑典上未有之先例，一般農人以及田主張，無論受田者出田者，莫不爲之心寒股慄，與化郷間田畝，已支配十之八九，共軍收入數字，亦至足駭人。按與化縣境計田二萬畝，每畝約值釉稻八石或十石。</p>
<p>又訊：蘇北共軍區域，以鬥爭之風甚熾，所謂「三資階級」逃亡一空，最近又於無產階級方面引起互鬥行動，其目的在被鬥爭者於萬不得已時，只須加入共軍，無論所犯若何重大事件，均可一筆勾消，但是畏懼鬥爭之勞動份子，又不願意加入共軍工作，處此極度緊張環境下，只得紛逃走，不遑寗處，以致「有錢要錢，無錢要命」之語，已成無聲之「歌頌」。共軍所發行之「抗幣」在春夏之間，一元「抗幣」，須兌法幣三十五元，最近只兌十元八元不等，幣價低落，實爲崩潰象徵。</p>
<h3>東北前途之繁榮　有賴於農業發達　張嘉璈對農業團發表演說</h3>
<p>〔本報審陽十一日電〕行轅經委會主任委員張嘉璈，十日夜在歡迎中美農業支術合作團宴席上發表演說云：東北現正值由僞滿統治而復歸祖國之緊要關頭，過去日本盡辦於滿洲之工業化，且更開發重工業，但滿意洲始終爲一農業區域，總計滿洲境內約有七五七萬戶，其中五四四萬戶係屬農民，約居全數之七十二，人口四五八九萬，其中農民約三三四二萬，其百分比相似，足見東北人民前途之繁榮，賴於農業發達者至切，過去滿洲全部國民所得爲六十八億元，其中得之於農業者爲廿八億元行之於工礦業者約十四億元，由此益可證明農業部份於滿洲整個經濟組織之重要性。查日前東北已經開墾之耕地約二萬萬畝，尙待開墾者約二十萬餘畝，其已開墾之地年產約二千萬噸，倘以產量與耕地面積計算，則其產量祇及美國德國之半，生產低微原因：（一）肥料不足（二）水迴灌漑不足，（三）種籽品質次劣，（四）機械農具短缺。上項缺點，如能設法解除，同時並採用現代科學方法，改善制度，撲滅害蟲，則今後生產不難增加百分之二十，再加尙未開墾之耕地，生產產量當可年達四千四百萬噸。按現在年產二千萬噸之中，農民本身消費，及用以充牲畜口糧與貯作來種歲籽者已達一千六百萬噸，其餘四百萬噸可供出口，其中半數爲大豆，假定整個產量如能增爲四千四百萬噸，則出口方面即可增多二千四百萬噸。</p>

<p>社論</p>
<h3>以新的情緒來迎「八一三」　——並賀上海市參議會成立</h3>
<p>「八一三」這令人百感交集的日子，如今又來臨了。在每個中國人的心靈中，他們决不會忘記這個日子，這是決定每個中國人的生命，整天個中國民族生命的一個極重要的日子。中國抗日戰爭的全面展開，中日兩民族的盛衰隆替，以及此後三五十年中遠東及世界政治中重心的轉移，都被決定於九年前的今日。如今此日重逢，日七，以及整個世界正從戰爭的苦難中解放出來走向新生。我們緬懷過去九年間的苦鬥，首慶向領導我們作這個民族鬥爭的蔣主席謹致我們崇高的敬意；這是由於我們的領袖的英明領導，終之使人們克服所有的困難而獲致了勝利。對於無數爲抗戰而死難的軍民，我們也謹於此表示我們的哀悼與敬意；這是我們的死，纔有我們的活。</p>
<p>兵是凶事，中國人傳統的思想不尙武不好戰。我們這次的民筆戰爭，實在是爲了我們的民族生存而不得不有抵抗。如今抗日戰爭難告勝利，而我們民族的生存仍復感受嚴重的威脅。久經血戰之後，國本原已動搖，所望於和平勝利者，原冀干戈自成止，人民得以有一個生養休息的機會，國家能從戰爭的苦難中解放出來，走向復興新生。但不幸的是我們的抗日戰爭雖已中止一年，而這一年間，中國共產黨一面與政府進行商談，一面它的開裝部隊却四出襲擊，致戰亂出現在東北，華北，蘇北，中原各地。我們飽經戰亂的人民，仍復遭受顚沛流離之苦難，迄未曾有一個生養休息的機會。這種局面是誰造成的呢？無疑地是中國共產黨。政府爲了和平，爲了人民，不得不忍讓以求姑息。然而忍讓的結果，却使中共變本加厲。今日我們重逢這個具有歷史意味的「八一三」，我們爲了我們民族生存，深信我們的領袖，必能以他的英明領導，領導我們渡過當前的危難，領導我們的民族走向建國復興，像過去領導我們的抗戰一樣。</p>
<p>的確，現在的種種跡象，使人們深信我們的領袖正本其沈毅的精神，領導我們走向民族復興的大道。共黨的阻撓，終必克服。人民不容許在建國的大業上，有共黨及其黨羽出而阻撓，人民所要求的是安居樂業，違反這種人民意向的，最後必將遭受敗亡，這是歷史的教訓。政府表示與民更始，積極整軍縮編，前一些日子並且發表大批現役軍官的除役，這在近代中國史上是空前之舉，而其發表正在「八一三」九周年，日寇乞降最後勝利一周年的前夕，其意義自更深長。這無非表示政府如何積極圖治的決心，以實現我國防的現代化及軍軞的國家化；在另一方面大批軍官的解甲歸田，一掃過去抗命割據的惡習，實是中國政治民主化的可喜現象。關於政治民主化這一方面的努力，雖然中央政府的改組，因共黨及春黨羽的作梗，迄未有何事實表現，但在地方政府方面，各地民意機關的成立，便是政治民主化的一個必要條件。這一年來，自從勝利以來的一年來，各地參議會的紛紛成立，就是這種政治民主化的徵象。在這些參議會中，上海市參議會議員，經已選出，定於這具有歷史意味的「八一三」宣告成立，我們謹以一種新的興奮的情緒，來迎接這對於上海市民具有特殊意義的「八一三」。</p>
<p>九年前的「八一三」發動於上海，引起了全面抗戰，如今抗戰勝利，在勝利後的第一個「八一三」我們在上海看見有上海市參議會的正式成立。這參議會是上海市人民的機關，他們代表上海市民參與市政，他們來自社會各階層，來自各黨派，或不屬於各黨派，由市民投票選擇舉而產生，實是民主政治的實施。上海是中國第一大市，過去因「八一三」之發生於上海而引起全面抗戰，今抗戰勝利後首屆「八一三」，上海市之昭示給全國的，卻是市參議會的成立，民主政治的實施，風氣所播，深信亦秘能引起全面影響，使全國政治趨於民主化，達到民族的眞正復興。所以在抗戰的歷史上，上海旣起了一種領導作用，在民族復興的歷史上，如今因市參議會的成立，上海亦應該在全國發生示範及領導的作用。</p>
<p>因之，上海市參議會的責任是相當重的，作爲一個民意機關，在實施憲政的前夕，我們希望上海市參議會能够發揮它最大的力量，民主政治的核心就是人民具有最後的力量，揆諸我們的「權」「能」學說，主人。上海自光復以來，市政上的措施，並非全無可議，如今市參議會成立，必須積極發揮它監督政府的作用，爲我國今後的民主政治樹一典範。戰爭是過去了，我們以新的情緒來迎「八一三」，這所代表的不是戰爭，而是中國的復興。</p>

<h3>美國前任駐蘇大使分析蘇現實政策（上）　他說羅斯福看錯了</h3>
<p>美國前駐蘇大使浦立德，在他所著的「世界大勢」一書中，曾詳細分析蘇聯的思想，政策，和現實外交的背景。對於想了解蘇聯的一切作風的人，這本書似極値一讀。全書共五章，這裏所節譯的，乃是該書的一小部份。</p>
<p>蘇聯，正如羅斯福總統在一九四〇年二月十日演講時所說的，乃是個「完全獨裁的國家，較歐洲任何獨裁國家更爲澈底」。一年以後，德國進攻了蘇聯，美國爲了自己的利益，決定帮助蘇聯。羅斯福總統願意無限止地帮助蘇聯作戰，但希望能說服史達林，使他從此放棄了向外的侵略思想，而採擇民主政治的辦法。批評家曾指出，這是不可能的，但羅斯福不相信。結果，戰後蘇聯在波蘭，匈牙利，南斯拉夫，德國，伊朗，朝鮮和中國東北的所作所爲，全證明了羅斯福總統是看錯了，雖然他自己沒有親見。</p>
<p>爲什麼史達林還要如此呢？蘇聯地域如此廣大，人口並不稠密，未墾之地，處處皆是，礦藏豐富，資源無窮，而人民亦正飽經戰亂，亟思休養生息。那末，爲什麼蘇維埃政府擴張的野心，還是如此永無休止呢？</p>
<p>要了解這個問題，我們必須先了解蘇聯根本的向外侵略思想。它們中有些是由於歷史的心理因素，有些是由於主義中的敎條。</p>
<p>（一）傳統的猜疑</p>
<p>俄國人的祖光是烏克蘭原和諾夫格羅——莫斯科區森林地帶的居民。那裏是一片平野，四望無際，絕無天然的屏幛，自蒙古直伸到波多。在這片廣大肥沃的歐亞平原上，從初民時代起，就是一次次野蠻民族的向西遷移。俄國人對於這批侵略的部落一直是束手無策，而北方，南方，和西方又全是虎視耽耽的鄰族。他們時常被征服。他們的歷史是一連串戰爭，饑荒，痛苦，屠殺，姦淫和奴役的悲慘故事。在這種慘痛敎訓中，他們學得了把別人都看作是不懷好意的强盜。有時候，他們也與鄰邦和好相處，但這只是暫時的「休戰」，像我們那樣的永久的和平，在他們的歷史上是從未有過的。俄國人因此不得不時常猜疑外面的強大國家，在他們看來，為了生存，他們就不得不連用欺詐和戰爭。表面與人和好，暗裏準備下手，歷史的傳統環境使他們養成了這樣的一種第二天性。</p>
<p>（二）七百年獨裁</p>
<p>在俄國整個的歷史上，都是專制的獨裁者統治的。他們從來不知道什麼叫做生活在一種秩序的自由之下。俄國政制的極權形式，是從一二四〇年成吉思汗的孫子巴多征服了俄國的時候就確立的。兩百年中，俄國臣服在蒙古人的統治之下。俄國的貴族們對於統治者是絕對服從的，俄國的歷史家伐那特斯基如此說：</p>
<p>〔蒙古的影響在俄國政治和社會制度的各方面俱可看出。蒙古汗國是建立在個人對於統治者及國家絕對服從的思想之上的，這種思想，結果就深深滲入俄國人的血液，這就是，一切階級必須對國家作強迫性的服役，蒙古人並帶進了一種新的觀念，即統治者的絕對權力。汗的威權是一種殘暴的力量，服從絕無絲亳疑義，這種統治者絕對權力的觀念，在蒙古帝國覆亡之後，亦仍殘留迄今。」</p>
<p>從蒙古人統治的時代直到現在，俄國人已習慣於生活在一種極權的獨裁統治之下，覺得國家由一個獨裁者來領導而自己不得插嘴，乃是一件很自然的事情。（未完）</p>
<h3>法國壽婆逝世　享年一百零百</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社法國里爾十一日電〕法國人瑞爾泰夫人，頃在葛羅克斯寓所逝世，享壽一百零五歲又八月。按在一月以前，內政部長普利香曾以證書一紙父與福夫人，稱伊爲法國最老之婦人。現法國最老之婦人，當推一百零四歲之薩勃朗夫人。</p>

<h3>檢舉前長島洋行汽車修理廠　敵偽物資被隱匿　清查團委員親訪宣鐵吾　汪柱臣述代修汽車經過</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕接收淸查團自接受密吿檢舉韓人孫田昌植供敵軍火案後，近又接獲檢舉汪柱臣隱匿日人長島洋行汽車修理廠一案，淸查團據報，經張慶楨吳望伋兩委員進行調查，認爲案情重大，曾引文警備司令部扣押汪柱臣，吳張兩委員特爲此案親訪警備司令部司令宣鐵吾，據張慶楨委員吿本報記者稱：此案近日又有新發展，並由此案發現大批被隱匿之德僑物資，價値在十萬萬元以上，淸查團現仍儘速調查中。</p>

<h3>市參議會今晨成立　吳市部代表張部長監選正副議長　修補參議員列席問題須請求內部</h3>

<h3>南京被掘墳地　疑為趙灼之墓</h3>

<h3>戰犯生活不惡　打球消磨光陰　調查疇尙希民衆冊封於檢舉</h3>
<p>在昨天的下午，記者臨車到江　國防部戰犯管理處，訪問了一次關於目前尙留華的日僑和戰犯的現狀。</p>
<p>戰犯管理處的前身是戰俘管理委員會，自從改隸屬國防部以後，已經擴大了工作範圍，成爲一個全國性的調查戰犯和管理戰犯的機構，地址設在江灣高境廟，處長鄒任之最近奉部令率領了一個督導組，在東北視察日俘的遣送狀况。</p>
<p>截至目前爲止，因職犯嫌疑而被拘禁的日本人，共有一千一百一十七人，其中大部份是憲兵，約在七百人以上。管理處下面分設三個收容所，一在吳淞西丘舍，是專門收容憲兵的，另兩個都在高境廟，分別收容將官及一般性的戰犯。有些被拘的將官儘管已成了囚犯，還不忘他們的身份，而要求隨帶勤務人員，所以尙有一百多個並無戰犯嫌疑的日本人，也陪着留在收容所裏服侍他們。</p>
<p>這些戰犯除了嚴禁出入以外，在營裏享受着相當限度的自由。他們的食糧和補給都由政府負擔，並且每個月將官有八百元，士兵有二百元的零用費。他們自己組織了一個生活互助會，每天以打打棒球和其他運動來消磨光陰。管理處每星期舉行一次內務檢查，比外辦了一個宣導三日刋，除略載簡短的新聞之外，大部份文字注重對於他們思想的糾正。據說戰犯們在這樣的管理之下，都很安心，有不少人已在懺悔他們過去的行爲。因此，有自動學習國語的，也有自我檢舉的。</p>
<p>戰犯管理處分設四組，第一組擔任總務。第二組管理，包括警衛宣　等。第三組調查搜證。第四組研究審核資料戶籍。其中有日籍職員二十多人，他們都是以前軍令部重慶俘虜營的俘虜，經過八年的訓練，思想上已有了撤底的感悟，現在擔任着整理資料及翻譯調查情報等任務。</p>
<p>調查戰犯的工作，現在依舊非常困難，除了有許多罪行缺少法律上必需的實證以外，我國老百姓的怕麻煩，怕出頭，尤其使工作不能順利展開。所以戰犯管理處希望人民和有關機關能够予他們種種帮助，使那些爲非作惡過的戰犯早日得到他們應受的責罰。最近第一綏靖區車事法庭已有改隸於國防部的可能，那末對於今後的戰犯處理當可有比較密切的聯繋。</p>
<p>至於日本僑民大部份均已遣回，目前留在上海的均是各機關黴用的所謂「技術人員」，連他們的眷屬大約尙有一千餘人。日僑管理委員會早經結束，這些日人除了受他們黴用機關的約束以外，已無所謂管理了。（士）</p>

<p>（一）聯總處機構，係適應戰時需要而設，現在環境改變，應否裁撤，或如何改進，　得研究，但仍須　請最高當局核定。（二）工貸宜有專款，輪出貿易之獎勵，亦然，事關財政金融及工商實際需要，自應分別先後緩念，由政府與工商界詳細審核，方可決定，經濟部王部長對中小工廠之貸款，特別注重，已擬有具體辦法，將來擬在重要商埠，設立工商督導處，如能實施，當以最有效之辦法，協同關係方面，辦理工貸事宜，至爲避免通貨膨脹起見，對於實物貸款，亦當儘量設法辦理。</p>
<p>（三）提高非必需品及奢侈品之進口稅，並减免出口稅，以適度保護幼稚工業、經財二部正進行修正稅率，至海關緝私工作，亦已設法加強。</p>
<p>（四）外匯等級制，及進出口連銷制問題，實施時頗有困難，但在可能範圍內，亦可試辦，至生絲由中央信託局負責收購，宋院長已核定，對於茶葉收購問題，事關對蘇易貨，及英美銷路，將來當亦可援例辦理。</p>
<p>（五）關於組織復與實業投資公司，利用國外資金事，原則自屬可行，惟第一步先　國內游資入正軌，第二步可利用僑資及外資。</p>

<h3>統債紅票多甲乙均疲跌</h3>
<p>公債昨以財部抽籤還本，仍按舊案辦理，加之政局影響，不免趨向下游，　風略熾，統丙尙平，自六二〇元開後始終在六四〇元左右徘徊，結果較上週六下挫二十元，甲乙以紅票加多，下降四十元，統丁尙平，統戊亦小二十元。</p>
<h3>工商業前途悲觀　股票市況低迷</h3>
<p>華股昨因時局更爲惡劣，工商業前途悲觀，引起多方不安，斬多稍殷，上塲雖尙穩定，但難持久，晨初高價永紗七〇八元，美亞四〇五〇元，景福二二八元，新光二二五元，勤興一六八元，嗣後即逐步下落，人心惡化，無法振作，中途雖多掙扎，近午都盤至低價，永紗見六六五元，美亞三七三〇元，景福二〇三元，新光二〇二元，勤興一五五元，而後稍盤，冷門中小型以及元老股，均難回秀，仍稍盤低，結果較上週六計永紗下挫十九元，美亞微降二十元，景福等三小熱亦跌五元至八元不等，各校冷之中小型股雖跌而不多，元老股尙平</p>
<p>外股昨仍形死寂，初時毫無成交，後以零星之浮多，亟待脫手，怡紗在七千七至七千八，　有做開，餘者亦隨之而較有成交，各股參差不」，視求供如何而互元升降，結果業廣怡紗會德豐各跌半成光景，怡啤英聯亞洲徽降，鋼業紙業平平。</p>
<h3>煤市交易清稀</h3>
<p>煤市白煤趨勢徘徊，本地實銷仍爲平常，辦貨源源運來，數量雖然零星，而足需　市，故市上各實有求必供，腳　頗為　　。烟煤過程極爲平靜，交易亦頗淸　，　煤商聯合營處之配貨，購者亦乏，故市價與配價　已軌平，本炭到貨湧旺，行情　續回跌</p>
<h3>紗價普遍上升</h3>
<p>昨日紗市益形堅挺，廿支各級紗普遍上升二三萬，四十二支漲起五六萬之多，客幫方面粤南去化不湧，京　內地未見動靜，惟北幫對廿支紅魁星獨加垂青，吸收甚夥，人心因是益堅，午時紡建照例開紗，廿支有立馬大包及彩　　　　　，四十二支有水月雙設供售，　挺，因天津行市向榮，致人心提起，疲乏不振之　　亦被激昂，但實　北方粤閩等地皆有小額子的採辦，所以市而轉見良秀，結果升五百元至一千元。</p>
<h3>正金銀行改組</h3>
<p>〔聯合社東京十一日電〕協同通訊社今日消息，正金銀行即將全部改組，該行戰前於各國皆有分行，據息，該行資本將達五〇·〇〇〇·〇〇〇日元，（約合三·三三三·三三三美元）。</p>
<h3>英印茶莊買氣濃厚　杭州茶市高峯疊出</h3>
<p>茶葉市况，本街店莊及客帮之去化，依然絡繹不絕，故交易旣活躍自在，行情亦挺秀異常，至於洋莊茶市，　來坦洋紅茶，福建小種，陳次祁門，陳抽珍，英印兩莊買氣茁長米戢，過程亟呈平穩，且陳中抽珍市存較涸，貨主遂居扳俏，市氣卒吿翱翔，結果每担疾進至五萬六千元，以迄收市，脚地猶鞏固不餒，又據業中人云，目前杭州茶市高舉疊出，若陳項祁門每担標至十三萬元，尙不易順利暢收，揆其原因，自上週英商協和怡和兩洋行紛紛赴彼地蒐羅以來，人心愈趨愈佳，依現狀觀察，前途似乎續有扶搖　上之望。</p>
<h3>高粳挺秀</h3>
<p>昨南北兩市到米五六千石，店消動而不旺，高貨依然挺秀，中次似乎少神，秈米下級貨亦帶軟，惟白元存到兩少，價升二三千元，麵粉連日步跌之後，爲價已短，店方乘巧納取，是以消化轉活，價升二三百元，小麥北方依然　取白麥，閩方及汕厦均選高而辦，黃豆新貨稀少，回漲五六百元，油市店方零化，靑島來貨不旺，廠方豆菜油略有供應，市挺千元，常錫來貨均有，麩皮平定。</p>
<h3>人造絲漲十萬　綢貨仍無起色</h3>
<p>昨日絲市隨黃金上漲，人造絲一二〇號天橋有光，開盤做一百六十六萬元，後做高至七十萬元收盤，下午人心更振，求過於供，七十三萬元尙買不到，較之上週末漲起十萬元之鉅，雜牌一二〇號有光，亦步亦趨，俱高十萬元之譜，七五號金鷄半光，物稀更貴，出七十二萬元仍乏供應，一二〇半光比較遜色，較上週六大四五萬元，一五〇號有光，大七八萬元，廠絲洋行雖有納胃，但持貨者尙在觀望中，不肯廉脫，以致毫無交易，用戶絲普通貨七十四五分五擔頭，成交價在一百九十五萬至二百萬元之間，另擔約做一百八十五萬至九十萬元爲度，比之上週末，好起七八萬元，干經乏人過問，喊價開口貨另擔在一百三十五萬元左右，綢貨銷路未見起色，故原料雖昂，織成品售價尙難跟進，華錦縐昨市做二千一百元，比上週六只好起三四十元。</p>
<h3>新藥業請求恢復　配售拜耳藥品</h3>
<p>拜耳藥廠各種藥品，自經敵產局改用標售辦法後，各方紛紛爭購，價格內以提高，而外埠藥房，皆抱向隅之感，新　業公會理事長史致富特電該局，請求恢復配售，其原文節錄如下：拜耳先靈等各期存藥，前自本年一月以迄六月，逐次由拜耳將廠淸理處平價分組，配售與本市各藥房，市上售價得以穩定，自七月份起，改用標售辦法，竊以標售辦法，旨在求得高價，蓋標售者旣惟高價是估，標購者勢非高價不得，其有影響於華價之騰昂，顯屬無可諱言，敝會甚願鈞局即日取消標售辦法，回復向例，平價配售，若謂每種藥品，數量多寡不等，無從分組配售一節，敝會特爲貢獻補救辦法如下，一，數量充足者，仍依原定組數配售，二，數量稀少者，則照現存數分組配售，或擇他種藥品之銷路略同，價格相等者，補足分組之不足，如恐或有不公，則可用抽籤法定之，是否有當，敬乞裁奪</p>
<h3>猪牌蚊烟得派貨　本月十六日截止</h3>
<p>歐治化學工業廠出品之「猪牌蚊烟香」，品質精良，該廠爲普遍銷售起見，特與本外埠零售商舉辦產銷合作，特價派銷，自八月六日派銷以來，申請者異常擁擠，聞該項派銷辦法於本月十六日截止，外埠延長五天，凡本埠零售商在限期內尙可申請，發行所在河南路二四九號云。</p>
<h3>時局刺激人心　金市買風突起　美鈔亦漲一一五元</h3>
<p>烚赤昨以報載馬司調處失敗，蔣主席定十四日發表演說，人心激動，買風突起，晨開即升爲一九三萬五，一時求過於供，逐漸盤漲至二〇一萬，壓力漸來，趁高亦多了結者，漸吿微降，十時後，中央銀行配給一一五條，價一九八萬，入後曾回挫至一九七萬，但以人心尙堅，低後維持者殷，午刻仍迫近二〇〇萬大關，午後續有挺進，以二〇二萬高價結束，結果較上週六漲起九萬四，飾金掛高至念一萬五，紋銀未動，銀元則升，暗息仍自一角至一角三不等。</p>
<p>外幣美鈔亦被激動，晨開二五三〇元買價起，求過於供，一路盤漲至二六五〇元，賣價始有回風，迨降至二五六〇元後，復吿穩定，近午復微升至二五九〇元，午後仍形向榮，再升高至二六三〇元左右，結果較上週六猛漲一一五元，港票曾漲到五八五元左右，而後轉盤，結果較上週六再漲三元，港匯五五〇元買，五六〇元賣，印匯六六五元至六七〇元，美匯八千九至九千元，成交稍股，美匯明平暗緊，指定銀行賣價稍高。</p>

<h3>美報爭辯撤兵問題　多數擁護繼續留華</h3>
<p>〔本報特派員華盛頓十一日電〕紐約世界電訊報爲斯克利浦斯霍華德系大報之一，日前撰文，反對美軍自華撤退。大意謂：要求美軍撤退乃中共之全面宣傳攻勢，企圖影響美政府及人民，實則彼等之希望，在於以蘇軍蘇聯軍事顧問及代表團取而代之耳。該報並推測，蔣主席縱請中共參加中央政府，將來中共必仍不放棄製造內戰之策略，蓋蘇聯雖一再聲言不贊成在國際上實行共產主義，且希望中國成爲强盛民主之國家，而中共之最後目的依然欲使整個中國逐漸赤化也。同時，另一極端之每日工人報，代表美國共產黨、在社論中抨擊杜魯門總統之對華政策，堅促美軍撤離中國，甚至謂中國之內戰將引起第三次世界大戰，希圖危言聳聽。</p>
<p>〔美國新聞處華盛頓十一日電〕達拉斯新聞報討論美國在中國舞台上所扮之角色稱：「吾人之調解政策迄今雖無多大進步，但不妨繼續進行。然而吾人必須注意方避對一方或雙方予以軍事上之協助以免延長吾人正欲阻止之衝突。和平重建之中國，足爲世界安定之潛力，對於吾人尤有價値，以其能作爲吾人太平洋對岸强大而友善之大國。」華盛頓星報檢討美軍駐華之理由，並稱：美軍若果撤退，中共將乘虛而入，取而代之，而「成爲內亂之又一刺激。」星報末稱：「此等問題在處置吾人註華軍隊之計劃時，必須加以考慮。」</p>
<p>無綫電廣播評論家史淍廣播稱：</p>
<p>「在美陸戰隊被綁及被襲事件未獲充分及圓滿解決前，美軍自華撤退，決不可能。」史溫續稱二「共黨阻緩此次事件之調查，同時復製造謠言誣指陸戰隊與國軍並肩向彼等作戰，此種僞造之消息，乃中國鬥爭雙方單位之寻常程序，事實上陸戰隊從未與國軍並肩作戰。中國人之要面子，甚於其他國家之人民，彼等均知，吾人若果因遭製擊而撤退吾人之武裝部隊，則對於吾人，實爲大失面子的事。共黨何以採用强暴手段，以强迫吾人由中國撤退，令人殊難明白。彼等或許以爲如此做法使美國輿論要求撤回駐外之軍隊，以免爲一外國政府而生，但共黨誤斷國之反應，蓋吾人之陸戰隊軍隊決不因危險而撤退，且美認大部分　　亦　　　據　駐軍·美國之政策原擬在本年內撤退駐華軍隊，共黨對陸戰　之伏擊，或許巳展緩美軍之撤退，但無論如何，決不致加速其撤退。</p>
<p>紐約先鋒論報之社諭謂：「不論美海軍陸戰隊駐在華北有何危險，以今日之情况論，苟命其撤退，乃屬錯誤。」此間對於召回海軍陸戰隊宣傳之譴責，係對以下一種人而發：（一）數量雖小，但甚有影響力量之自由份子集團；（二）不僅爲中國之共產黨，且亦有蘇聯及美國之共產黨。因共產分子視美海軍陸戰隊之駐華，對於中共統治更廣土地之陰謀，大有阻礙，倘陸戰隊今日撤離中國，其結果即將使中國政治。軍事，經濟諸端陷於混亂，交通綫亦將被切斷，而爲恢復八年戰亂所急需之中國大部份工業生產亦立將停止。海軍陸職隊如自中國撤退，將使蘇聯人士相信美國已不再注意於建立一强盛而獨立之中國，但此適爲吾人從事太平洋戰爭之主要理由也。極欲在其邊境勢力空隙塡補力量之蘇聯，將使中國成爲另一波蘭。美國旣不許日本宰割四億五千萬人口之中國，當亦不許他國統治之。故目前海軍陸戰隊之駐華，似爲必要。最健全之途徑，乃努力創造一「聯合政府，使自由分子掌握平衡之勢力，此種政府能使中國獨立生存，於蘇聯美國以及其他國家之勢力以外。</p>
<h3>淞滬抗戰回憶</h3>
<p>— 楊虎</p>
<p>十年前之今日我中華民族在最高領袖英明決策之下，於淞滬地區揭開了更無先例的全面抗日神聖戰爭之序幕——「淞滬抗戰」此一序幕　的持續時間，雖僅八十餘日，但對最後勝利，却己奠定了寶貴的基礎，蓋僅此一戰我民族所表現之愛國與犧牲精神，實給予敵人對我民族傳統的侮　觀念，以嚴重的打擊，並啓發了瘵國持久抗戰的堅强意識，贏得了國際友邦之重視，故淞滬之戰實爲中華民族復興史上最光輝之篇幅。</p>
<p>當神聖戰爭爆發之日，余適在再度執役淞滬警備任內，且奉命兼　上海衛戌之責，前者之主要任務，為協助前綫軍事，後者則在確保地方治安，二者相輔而成，不容偏重，故予當時履行職責之原則爲協助軍民加强抗戰力量，軍事固爲一切中心，而政治，社會，外交，宣傅，陣地之事，供應救護，收容難民，物資保全，交通還輸等工作，更須齊頭並進，以求軍民全力作戰之遂行，惟予自感才力薄棉，職任繁重，固深自慄懼而又深知革命軍人與革命黨人對國家之重任，不敢稍存畏避之意，在戰事發動之前夕陽曾奉召赴京，經最高統帥面授機宜後，愈感責任重大，而益增報國報黨之決心。</p>
<p>在我大軍尙未到達預定前錢陣地之前，予以任務爲指揮地方軍警，確保前衛陣地，以待後方大軍之到達並進入預定之前綫陣地，此項前衛任務，使予深自警惕，誠恐不易完成，致誤重大軍機者，厥有數端：第一，當時地方軍警兵稱質量及裝配因遠遜於敵且多無作戰經騐，第二，前衛任務，旣在確保陣地在戰略戰術上，又不許先啓戰釁，第三，敵處主動地位我則須避先啓戰釁，敵我地區密接交錯，我不僅須適時佔領前衛陣地，並須掩護到達後的大軍進人前綫陣地並不致爲敵覺察，基上原因當時前衛任務之執行異常困難，然而終於順利完成使命使預定戰略戰術行動逐步有利展開，實上賴最高統帥德威之感召，暨各級指揮官指揮如定，下則軍民一體，敵愾同仇，有以致之，戰事正式展開後，予以前衛任務變爲側後警戒，前述以軍事為中心綜合任務，因以開始二十世紀之戰爭為總力戰綜合戰，故予於執行綜合任務中，一財　　　動地方人力物力，協助戰區　　之進展，開時又在三民主義原則下，運用國民外交　我方整個戰略戰術，均受其利，當時有瞰之士即巳感到第二次國際戰爭之必然來臨，幷深知與我有利，今者敵寇屈膝勝利終歸於我無疑乃我　最高領袖之神明睿智發揮國力運用外交，才獲得這最後勝利，才爲民族爭得了永恒的光榮。</p>
<p>今天回憶起來，當時淞滬抗戰之所以順利展開不能不感謝地方領袖，全體人民，軍警同胞，及盟邦友好在戰役中所給與的莫大助力使予於重荷之下始終無所隕越，惟念八年抗戰將士犧牲，人民痛苦，難以計量，以如此鉅大代價，換來的勝利之果竟於一年後的今天，愈覺國步益艱，天災人禍言念心傷，建國大業阻礙橫亘，我全國軍民尙須再度發揮淞滬抗戰時之愛國精誠，在最高領袖蔣主席領導下，加緊努力，完成建國大業，予雖年老退役願隨全國軍民之後掬其最後報國之忱。</p>

<h3>關於輪船被刦</h3>
<p>編輯先生：閱昨日貴報載滬通班航利輪在駛行途中被刦一案，旅客損失不　，事後海盜乘帆船揚長而去。愚以爲當輸被刦之後，機器可曾被海盜弄壊。照報載事後仍可行駛，則愚意當那海盜在登帆船逃行之中剛離船之時，大可以鐵　之船向他木帆船身猛撞一下，使他們翻身入海，武器落海沒用後，再救他們出來，拘送水巡隊法辦。此法雖冒險，但如此則海盜必挫手不及，終致落網。這不過是一種幼穉之想而已，根本辦法尙在當局嚴厲預防，使以後不再有如此之事發生，則行賈旅客，叨光安全多多矣。（王敬中）</p>

<h3>如果你的孩子发脾气</h3>
<p>— 余人鳳</p>
<p>孩子是家庭裏重要的份子，又足以增進夫婦間的感情和愛情；但要是有個又討人壓又愛發脾氣的孩子呢，反會引起夫婦間的爭執了。</p>
<p>但，孩子之易發脾氣，並不是天性，有的受了各種環境所釀成的，做父母的應負極大的責任。時常去觀察他們，尋出他們所以發脾氣的原因，而施以治本的方法；</p>
<p>（一）要孩子時常忙着，他就沒有功夫去發脾氣。所以我們最好給孩子一種含有創造性的玩具去玩，一方面可以促進兒童創造精神，一方面可使他們得到一種難做成的事情而竟完成的愉快，豈不是一舉數得嗎？可是也要注意到這玩具是否太難，太難了，孩子就要過用腦力而損及身體的健康，做的不成功也會引起他們失敗的困感，和怕做的心理？</p>
<p>（二）要把小孩子看成像成人一　，我們平常都以爲不需以尊重给孩子們，我們可以隨意的把孩子正在玩着的東西　去，但是孩子也有他的　利，也有他的欲望，我們怎麼以把他正玩得津津有味的東西奪去呢？難怪他會反抗會發怒了。雖然他玩的是不合理的東西，也不要從他的手裏立刻奪下，總要好言好語的對待孩子！</p>
<p>（三）對待你的孩子前後應一致，有一次，我看見一個孩子穿了他父親的　鞋子大跑起來，我看他很可笑，他的母親也大笑不止。過了幾天他又把他父親的新鞋子穿了，太跑大跳起來，他母親因爲怕他把鞋子弄壊，所以喊起來了，把那鞋子搶走，於是這小孩子哭起來了。爲什麼做同樣的事情，在第一次受歡迎，第二次却要受禁止呢？這難怪孩子會莫明其妙而發脾氣了。我們要注意這一點，當着小孩子做了不合理而又很可笑的事情的時候，應頭一次即予以警吿，不要頭一次笑他，而第二次却加以呵責；即使他所做的事是極可笑的話，我們也應該笑後加以一種教訓，叫他下次不可再弄，弄了要受責罰。那麼他第二次做的時候，雖受责也覺得是應當，而不會莫名其妙的發脾氣了。</p>
<p>（四）孩子會自然去求極端滿足他的慾望的，要是沒有加以提示，他會一直的做下去。所以做父母的，當小孩做到太過分的時候，即當加以一種不愉快的表情，使他曉得他所做的事情是爹爹媽媽所不喜歡的，同時也把這個事情的錯處，解釋給他聽，那麼下次再犯的時候即受呵責，也不會驚詫而發牌氣了。</p>
<p>（五）要注意小孩的心理狀態，孩子太疲倦，飢餓，或受過度刺激的時候，很容易發怒，而做出一種往日雖在盛怒下也不會做的事情。當他們是在這樣環境之下，做父母的不要加責他們，應張力的去找出他們之所以發怒的原因，而加以解除，（好像　與之食，　與之衣等）或與之以相當時間的休息，等他們回復常態平靜的時候，再用開導的方法，說給他們聽，把他們不對處，對他們講。</p>
<p>（六）孩子是天生好動的，好奇的，不謹愼的。但是有許多人，竟爲了他們這種性情，不能够忍耐起來，孩子只是孩子，那能够像大人們一樣的判別那樣事情是好，那樣事情是壊呢？比如孩子穿上一件新的衣服，他會坐在地上去玩，或吃水果，把很新一件衣服弄得很　而被賣的時候，就要發脾氣了。孩子之所以把衣服弄　，是因爲孩子不知把衣服弄　是一種壊的行爲，做父母的，要用觀察和敎導，去處置去啓發他們的愚蒙，不要時時加以無理的責打。</p>
<p>（七）孩子是最留心他四周的環境的，易怒的人們和孩子一塊，足以影響到孩子，也使他變成易怒了。我的隔壁，有一家只有母子二人，那個母親天天在喝駡她的兒子，所以地的兒子也變成頑皮，易怒了。　（八）小孩發怒的時候·不要把他所希望的東西給他。有許多做父母的，因爲要使孩子停止發脾氣，竟用盡干方百計去滿足小孩子的不正常要求，這樣一來，那孩子雖然怒氣停止了，但是將來無論要求什麼東西的時候，就會如法泡製，那豈不是成了習慣！有许多小孩子發脾氣的習慣，是這樣養成的。</p>
<p>（九）當孩子發怒的待候，他頂喜歡去捉人家的注意。有時候，他的發怒，只不過要引起大人的反響，使大人知道他是怒了；也許要探測大人們對於發脾氣反響的程度，而得到慰安；但是有許多大人，竟上他的當，嚴的，就把他重重的警戒一下，由是他雖然有時因而壓服，但却愈增進他的探測心，而有第二次試騐；有時不受　服，却反要怒燄更張起來了。軟弱的父母，就把東西去制止他的怒氣，那麼却更糟了，孩子以爲一發脾氣，就可以得到意外的東西，那麼怎不會接速的發怒呢？所以做父母的當你們覺得小孩子是因這樣而發怒的時候，你不但不要去管他，而且可以儘管對他講，他這種做法，是得不到什麼結果的。他　可以竭力的發脾氣，讓他得到了　樣敎訓—知道發脾氣是無用的—下次也不會隨便發了！</p>
<p>以上所　對待小孩發脾氣辦法，須具有絕對決心的父母們　能做到。有許多小孩子，發脾氣的時間很長久，爲父母的怕孩子氣壊了，明知故犯，把東西賄他們，這樣就養成孩子的劣根性；有些父母能夠下決心，却是因为祖父母的緣故，就屈服於孩子了，但是骨年父母們，到底你的孩子前途要緊呵！</p>

<h3>炊事　冰結漣</h3>
<p>— 鄒尙昌</p>
<p>値此炎夏，主婦們多帶了子女至飲冰室進食冰結漣，旣費金鐃，又費時問，子女多的話更加不便。現在我來介紹省錢，省時的自製冰結漣。如果四五人吃則用小桶已足够，我們時常在馬路旁小攤上看到出賣蛋卷冰結漣的，他們就是用這種桶子搖出來的。</p>
<p>材料是六只鷄蛋，一聽淡奶，一小瓶香精，適量的糖，十五磅冰及少量的　。</p>
<p>想將雞蛋打碎，蛋白蛋黃分開，打成泡沬，然後將淡奶糖及香精放入，調勻，如果你喜歡吃甜的那麼多放點糖，然後倒人搖冰結漣的鐵桶中，再加冷開水至差一寸就滿時爲止，（因爲搖了之後會變鬆而成滿滿的一桶）放入木桶中，外加以冰，上放　少許以降低其溫度，一切弄好之後就可以開始搖了，大約一刻鐘即可以取出來吃，其味極美，不下於買來的。如果你府上有小弟妹自學校中領來脫脂奶粉的話，那麼正可以利用，盛一茶盃的奶粉，用水調勻，使無顆粒而止，然後與蛋，淡奶，糖等調製，則其味更濃。</p>
<p>總計所花費的，不及四五人至店中食用的費用之半，而其量則多於店中之一倍，眞可稱得上價廉物美。賢明的主婦們，與其大熱的天老遠跑到店中去吃，爲何不自製一桶呢？</p>
<h3>家事一得</h3>
<p>— 李瑩</p>
<p>近日天時酷熱，各類昆蟲毒物，時常出現，前日偶過友家，見因蚊帳內發現蜈蚣一條，手足無措，致將蜈蚣在帳外夾住勢一大洞取下，可謂愚極。</p>
<p>如帳內發現毒物，而帳子不便卸下者可將盛有水之面盆，以手舉起，置於毒物之下面，另一人在帳外用物一擊，即掉於盆內，盆內有水，不能爬行，唯須手足經盈敏捷，以免逃　，而費週折。</p>
<h3>談修飾</h3>
<p>— 木每</p>
<p>愛美是人類的天性。在適當範圍之內，我是不反對一般人的裝飾的。往往有人以「塗脂抹粉「來譏　女人，所謂「女爲悅已者容」那句古話，多少有些輕侮女人的意思。其實，我以爲與其　首垢面亂頭粗服，給予人們一個討厭的感覺，還不如淡淡地適當地把你的頭髮，面部和衣服等修飾一下給人們感到淸潔美觀的印象好得多。至於有許多女子專事濃粧艷抹奇裝異服去博得同性們的嫉妒和異性們的　　，那是大可不必的。</p>
<p>修飾最要緊的條件，是合乎自已的身份和注意自己的年齡。一個十五六歲的中學生，手衷拿了書本子，脚上穿了高跟鞋，你說合適不合適？一個五六十歲的祖母，燙了頭髮再抹上了唇膏，你說配不配？善於修飾的，不論頭髮，衣着，鞋襪，一定配得適於你的身份，年齡，那末你處在大庭廣衆之間，一定能够給予人們一個適如其份的好印象，決不會對你行注目禮或加以低聲的議評了！</p>
<p>可是，上海的一般婦女們，太喜歡一窩風的習尙，一件旗袍，只要外面流行什麼式樣，就不管一切的跟着去倣效，有一個時期，外面時行一種橫條花樣的衣料，身材瘦長的穿了，固然襯托得很美，但是，一般身材矮胖的也倣而效之，穿了後，衣料本身的花樣確是很麼登的，但是穿在矮胖的身上，只覺其人加倍的矮短，而且近乎　腫，絲毫不覺得美了！近年來，許多麼登婦女喜歡赤脚穿皮鞋。一雙共嫩似藕一無疤　的脚上加上一　雪白的皮鞋，確是覺得整潔，簡便；但是，不能個個女子的脚如出一例的。曾有一次在路上看見一側年紀已近五十歲的老婦，頭髮燙作波浪形，旗袍的二袖短得齊肩，肩上還褂了一只帶子很長的皮包。臉上又是搽得紅是紅，白是白，可是，遮不了一絲絲的皺紋，我再低下頭來一看，更不得了，她竟赤脚穿一雙白鹿皮的　空鞋，那種走路時一扭一捏的極不自然的狀態，天知道，這明明是一雙重新改造過來的天足呀！這眞是何苦來呢？自身旣感到不舒服而又一無美觀可言，更給人背後嗤笑　論。像這種　目倣效的裝飾，眞是欲增其美而反益加其醜了！</p>
<p>愛美並不算婦女界的什麼恥辱，而所應注意的就是不要一味學摩登，而忘掉了自己的身份和年齡。</p>

<h3>關於　藝術大眾化問題</h3>
<p>— 史良黻</p>
<p>「藝術大眾化」的問題，在戰時就討論得很熱烈，主張「大眾化」的倡論者，不斷的强調着「藝術應該是大眾的」，「藝術不能與羣眾絕緣」，「不為大眾所接受的作品，將失去它的價値」。此種說法，照琩不容我們否定的，然而，事實上到目前為止，這一問題還是一個問題，藝術家嘴裏如此說，筆頭這樣寫，可是他的作品是不是都是大眾所喜悅的呢？我敢說一句：造詣愈高深的作家，這條路在目前愈是走不通！就拿木刻藝術說吧，一開始它就標榜着現實主義自命為大眾藝術，在戰時的自由區裏，由於金屬版蝕製的不易，他也曾得到一些人們的欣賞，但是欣賞木刻的是不是中下層社會一些勞苦的羣眾呢？這是一個很大的？號。記得我們在皖省舉辦過幾次全國木刻作品展覽會，觀眾也不能說少！最奇怪的是觀眾中沒有農民（或商人），即使有一兩個湊熱鬧的，他們也沒有像看月份牌和看傅奇的連環圖那樣發生興趣。說是作品的內容和形式不行嗎？不！我們展出的作品差不多十分之九是作家的得意傑作，而且展出之前經過幾度的擢擇，不能說不够水準。為什麽有這種現象發生？這就說明着藝術大眾化除了牽就大眾以外，在現階段的中國社會倡論着藝術大眾化是此路不通的，因為作品的造詣愈深一班知識水準不够的愈是莫明其奧妙！那麽一個作家是不是願意他的技巧和內容，不求更進步，就只停留在迎合大眾庸俗趣味的階段上就算滿意呢？我以為除了它的表現手法沒有辦法長進和另有企圖以外，這是絕對不會有的事的。這些話我覺得得並不是否定了藝術應該大眾化的眞理，眞正要藝術大眾化並不是要藝術本身降低它的價値去迎合大眾，而是先要把大眾的欣賞能力提高，才是一條正當的途徑。</p>
<p>因此我們得到一個結論：如果大眾社生活水準不提高，跟着也就享受受不到較高的敎育，敎育程度愈低，欣賞能力也也就愈低，所以問題的焦點，還是在於「民生」兩個字，光是力竭聲嘶的乾喊藝術大眾化是沒有用的。</p>
<h3>顚簸</h3>
<p>— 張白懹</p>
<p>我們要離開的，是一個在將來的記憶是多麽深刻的地方老　茂盛的大樹底下。熱情的手揮舞着，一曲情深而懇　的　歌唱起了，插在車頭上的三角小紅旗，開始在亮鼎的陽光中轟動。我們的身體也在輕微地波震着，窒悶的車廂像打開窗戶的樓屋，很快地流過了一層山野的歡愉……。</p>
<p>人勻被載着，在向一個新的憶憬前進了。聽說那目的地，曾經是一個何等偏僻的邊城。今天我們想像這邊城有怎樣一條從是寂寞的夢裏笑出聲音的長長的巿街，小學生成羣地追逐在士兵們的背後，分得了糖菓，餅乾，和其它的玩具與禮物……。</p>
<p>地有幾下强烈的跳動，這道路，是多慶壓不平呵！耳邊震動的聲音，好　連我也感覺到賬悶的暈眩，說着的同志們似乎就是那末三四個，我偶然張開不知在什麽時候　上的眼睛，呃呃，那一位同志嘔吐了，</p>
<p>，人們用手掌揩抹着，也有掏出點着服務隊那一位小姐姓名的手帕。—或者，鏽着他最親愛的人的名字也是有的呢。</p>
<p>「喂，讓開些！」有誰對那些在車　上的三位伙伴喊起來。</p>
<p>「讓開些，裏而一點風也沒有啊！」</p>
<p>那是車　高出駕駛座的一條空　，坐在車廂裏的人的唯一幸福，希　就在上面。你看，那三位同志又多麽尊重別人的意見，他們迅速　靠向兩邊，願自己坐着那麽快小的地位，他們不會在車子下坡的時候，一不小心，而發主　　嗎？</p>
<p>當我們的車子停在一個荒凉的小　上，　日的天空　下一　微雨　，同志們是怎樣愉快地　展着旅途的床　呵。那冷落的小飯館和茶店，有了快樂輕器的談笑。「　，　麽不行呵，　一點銘苦　吃不　了嗎？」有人　笑那嘔吐的弱者，他們　　吐一把　　的唾　，雖然飢仍為九，却仍然拒絕着食物的弱誘。</p>
<p>弟子在　　和　　上轉拆着，又是一條　眞的大路。這麽，展　們計算　，可以在貨昏的時候，到　一　城巿。</p>
<p>抗　　的聲音，車上的人們都沉默着，　　了疲乏而　，也　　有人　　　　點想着一些什麽。唉，我似乎聽到一個人的嘆息，這車子把他送向的是那樣一個遙遠的地方，而這些同志們，他們大多將在經過的城巿裏，看見曾經鼓勵他們去加入戰爭的同學，敎授，以至他們所驕傲的善於交際的女朋友……。</p>
<p>那末，他們都應該在想了。如何把那新的生活，那緊張得連寫信的時間也沒有的生活，向他們誇耀吧！為什麽不値得誇耀？「你看，」他們可以這樣義：「我的皮　的顏色，就表明一切了。」</p>
<p>但是，　多　的　　！我們的車子竟忽然拋錨啦！那前輪脫離了車軸，車子傾倒着向前　了幾十步，路上　下一條深深的　跡。司機吐着舌頭說：要是下斜坡的話，這一下就完了！</p>
<p>那麽，還需要徒然的担心嗎？我們的司機是一位顯練的技土，他們並不遲疑，鑽到車子底下檢查了一番，敲着，旋着，便修理起來了。</p>
<p>在那山峯頂上，看到橙黃的光綫，夕陽染紅了半邊天空，晶亮的晚霞，白雲悠悠地舞蹈。</p>
<p>同志們就　攏着唱歌。</p>
<p>薄暗中，車子現在是睜大兩隻眼睛來了。司機還故意撅動那個喇叭，使山野間起了一個波動。哦，好開車了吧，人們現在又多麽需要一頓鼎盛的晚餐呵。</p>
<p>夜的城，憩下了我們的喘息。臭虫和蚊子，吮吸着我們疲勞的睡夢。旅途，還很遙遠。</p>
<p>第二天，又把行李搬到車子上。我成為那漆着綠色的車頂上三個乘客的一個了。我被敎着用皮帶勒住自己的肩胛，知道了那並不危險。我的兩個伙伴是和善的，他們告訴我，迎着風，不會暈眩，祗是通過路旁樹木枝椏的時候，得小心低頭，提防你的眼鏡……。</p>
<p>眞的，這和生在裏面的時候比較，那是枷鎖和自由一樣地不同呵。坐在這裏，看到的是天空的蔚藍，陽光的瑰麗，蜿蜒的公路和四野的綠色，那橋，那村屋，和那大石級樣的梯田……使人在顚簸中也可以顧盼着而欣賞到自然的奇異。我和我的同志們還談說着過去與未來夢，而共同表示一個堅決的信心。</p>
<p>我們隨時都在注意的，不要使那裏面的一個同志因窒悶而生氣呵。我們側身坐着，「凉風呀；進去吧！一，我們甚至於這麽喊喚着。</p>
<p>經過一個城，又經過一個城……這些城，雖然是紅的綠的，但是我們想，我們年青的新隊伍有一天進入縱橫的柏汕馬路，以坦克和摩托卡作為前導，有無數民眾和女郎向我們投擲花朶，我們才眞正驕傲而快樂呢！</p>
<p>我們已經走過七百公里的路了。最後一天，我們的車子爬過一座高峻的山嶺，在和那盆地上的一個邊城祗有很短的距離時，天陰沉的風　，終於奔騰而至，車子在風和雨的阻擊中，走完最後十公里的路。我們為了一種心的堅持，不曾因為衣服水濕而　避到擁擠的車廂中去，脫了鞋襪，捲起　袖，我們撐着，微笑着坐在風雨中，呼嘯的雨聲，雷聲，車輪底下飛　的水聲，我們心中有一種奇特的緊張的快感，好　正從事於一次戰鬥。</p>
<p>看見郊外新築的靶塲，到了，我們歡呼着，然後歌聲隨着車子開進城門，黃昏裏，當從車子跳下來的時候：一坐也有人在想：邊地的山城，一條好長的街道呵，有一天偉大的行列，將從之裏蜿蜒如龍地去向千里外的　濱……。</p>

<h3>鬱雷</h3>
<p>— 楊廉沅</p>
<p>在悶熱的氣流裏，隆隆地響着的，是鬱雷嗎？</p>
<p>告訴你，兩小時之前，我在一家劇院裏散塲回來，那時候，天上佈滿着烏雲，我想這老天是怎樣地煩燥着哩！而我却帶回了舞台上那一份欠明朗的氣氛，心頭正為那一代人物底悲歡離合而唏噓，而深深地太息着。</p>
<p>那末，我難道也感染了些微輕淡底哀愁了嗎，也許我已經開始在思索着別的一回事了，唉，這很雖說。</p>
<p>現在，我想請你在塵封底回憶裏探索一番，把年代回溯干年頭之前去，桐蔭下，畫廊邊，外面叫賣冰類的聲音傅不到裏面來，這時候，屋子裏的人都在忙碌着世俗之事。那時，你，一個生命還沒到開花年紀的孩子，我，是個少年。現在，且學句大人的口吻，說是兩小無猜，你說對麽？再想想，我們也許都會乘下微紅的頭來。桐蔭下我們合讀着書，一部美麗而有着太多敎訓的書：「紅樓夢」。</p>
<p>再說得確切些，我們正做着一個同樣的夢。</p>
<p>眞是遼遠的事了，今天的鬱雷却發掘了我太多的憶戀。</p>
<p>今天我看了那叫做「紅樓夢」，也即是叫做「鬱雷」的劇本回來，因此，我想到應該寫下一些什麽了，說吧！說我的喜悅，說我的怨　。</p>
<p>小時候，我們都是做着同樣的夢：我們的出身相同，所受的敎育也是相同。今天說來，也許我們都會啞然失笑吧，悠悠歲月，想來如同隔世。原來在童稚的夢還沒蘇醒時，我們却已經分手了。</p>
<p>為什麽分手了呢？今天回憶祇是徒增苦痛而已，但是，苦痛却是緊緊跟隨了我看了「紅樓夢」演出，它遂敲着我悲哀的心弦了。</p>
<p>劇中人寶玉說：「我的聲音和鬱雷一樣，哭喊不出，被幾千年的雲彩壓住了。」那末，我們的聲音也敎這些年來的雲彩壓住了麽？</p>
<p>我知道，這些年來，你是度着清水供養的生活，外邊的暴風雨侵製不着你，這種生活於你發生着如何的影響，現在你是不是瞭然了呢？</p>
<p>在過去的幾年裏，要担當時代賦予的精神底負荷，也要為自己感情的火燄漸漸熄滅而發愁。我是如此。</p>
<p>請問，你是怎樣呢？</p>
<p>我的聲音是　啞了，但我是不肯「定」於命的。</p>
<p>此刻是子夜，一個詩人口裏所說的仲夏夜，外面凉風拂進窗來，炎暑驅盡了我遂享有一個清靜的夜。</p>
<p>可是，鬱雷却是響着了，那聲音是煩燥的。</p>
<p>告訴我吧！我們得忍受到幾時？</p>
<h3>一寸山河一寸血</h3>
<p>— 葉勁風</p>
<p>—這部傅奇，如尚有一分價値的話，作者　以萬分的敬意，　給八年來引　　　。戰而犧牲的鬥士們，和他們的家屬。</p>
<p>·楔子·</p>
<p>對不起，　子這兩個字，本來有些舊了，舊得可憐，但很合用，只得沿用一次，請　者原諒—</p>
<p>在三萬八千九百三十一次小戰中，有這麽一　事。可記不清是那一次（請注意，披軍都紀錄。）這一次抗戰，除了三萬八千九百三十一次小戰外，還有一千一百一十七次重要戰鬥，還有二十二次　忠泣神的大會　。）反正在這三萬八千九百多次小戰中，有　這　一　事。</p>
<p>雖是一次小戰，敵我雙方鬥爭得相當激烈，二十四小時內，　　，　　，沒去多少曁歐。只是簽了一座手　，　大想德溫　　，戰軍　　的守住，沒有放　　一下。我方主要火力，僅有兩座　　槍集，布曁在　　　，一左一右，程　不到十碼，發　　　民　，　在　北淮　橋的一點上。</p>
<p>敵人有的是火器，　槍，　彈筒，小鋼砲，等等。平均每二小時，我方的機關槍巢，總有一座被毀，因為沒有很堅强的屏障。好在一座被毀，就有一座補充上去。就這樣苦苦的支持了一個對時。</p>
<p>担架隊是這裏救護傷兵的惟一辦法，但人手不够，只好　輕傷的架着重傷的，上聯部臨時醫院去。例行的洗滌，上藥，包紥，或動手術，都經過了，不救的，當然抬出去掩埋了，能救的，總算是經過良好。例外的症狀只有一件，相當棘手，因為夫　過多了，這裏恰又沒有輸血的　備，只好讓他不死不活地躺在那裏需命，　分高的熱度，叫他不住的呻吟，　語，狂叫。</p>
<p>夜班護士一半同情，一半也有些煩躁，看見那個輕傷的同伴，守在那裏，不肯走開。「怎麽不快點把他弄得來，是你打他的？」護士有些憤慨。</p>
<p>「報告班長，不是蠻拖，他還不走咧。」湖南口音裏，夾了些外省腔調。</p>
<p>「為甚麽？」護士有些生氣了。</p>
<p>「那個曉得囉……鬼子都跑乾浄了，他還捨不得放手。」輕輕地嘆了口氣。</p>
<p>「旁的弟兄呢？」護士似乎恢復了同情心。</p>
<p>十個死了八個半！「傷兵感到凄慘。」報告班長的話，你老人家不相信的話，明天儘管去看囈，兩架槍巢，地下的泥巴都紅了，成了兩坑血塘子！</p>
<p>「啥」！護士大槪體味到了那兩泥坑的血，眉天立刻蹙在一起，好像要打　心似的。</p>
<p>「這個傢伙，」傷兵指着那尖失血過多，在床上躺着的，「腿上，脅下，肩膀上，頭上，都是彈片傷。……一隻砲彈，在我們右邊兩三米達開了花。……一路走，一路淌血，一個人身上才兩升入合血，那有個淌不完的？」</p>
<p>床上躺着的，這時候，手，脚，全身，不　的抽搐顫抖，沙啞的嗓音，夾着痰，微弱傷　不清楚，好像在說，「媽…的…幹啊，…老子…就是不籬你…過來！</p>

<p>自由談</p>
<h3>無言</h3>
<p>— 少夫</p>
<p>今天是八一三，淞滬抗戰的那一幕血的史劇，距離今天整整十年了。</p>
<p>十年，恍如一夢，十年，時間雖不算短，（人生其實有幾個十年呀！）但當時的一切似乎非常清晰，如在眼前，以國家做一本賬來說，這十年來，我們可以說都盡了資，也可以說我們都沒有盡到完全的責任</p>
<p>我們想想，十年前的今日，彌漫在大上海的是一種什麽樣的空氣，人們是一種什麽樣的情緒；十年後的今日又是一種什麽樣的空氣和清緒？</p>
<p>今天，我們又面臨一個最嚴重的關頭，其嚴重甚至超過十年前的今日，因為外侮可以亡國，內患更可以亡國。我們一方面緬懷無數英勇將士的犧牲流血，另方面對未來的日子實不厜恐懼危慄之至。</p>
<p>眞是千言萬語，不知從何說起了。</p>
<h3>不是八股——為「八一三」說幾句話—</h3>
<p>— 佑芙</p>
<p>「八一三」在中國的歷史上，是一個沉痛的日子，也是幸福日子。</p>
<p>九年前，她解脫了中國次殖民地被壓迫的枷鎖，發出中華民族反抗的呼號。</p>
<p>湊巧得很，一年前的今天，戰爭畢竟是勝利了，這也可以說，「八一三」是象徵着中國的光明與幸福。</p>
<p>去年今日重慶的國府路兩路口，夫子池，精神堡壘，小什字，民權路，民族路，中一路，中二路等每一條街道上，尤其是廣播大廈門前，絡繹不絕的人們，在帶滿笑容靜聽勝利的佳音，那一種狂歡的情緒是表示勝利賜予每個人無限的幸福，使每一個人忘記了八年來種種苦難的生涯。</p>
<p>在街上，每一個行人見到，總是異口同聲的一句問話：「幾時回家」，「八一三」的。前後幾天，許許多多的人，整日的給勝利之神支配着忘記了自己，甚至於連夜間也不睡覺。</p>
<p>廣播大廈的凉台上，擺着兩隻大喇叭，向全重慶的人川流不息的傅播着日本投降的喜訊，因此多少人漏夜地在廣播大廈的石階兩旁，坐着，立着，傾聽那熱狂的報告。</p>
<p>在成都，三五成羣的少男仕女，並肩的徘徊在春熙路上，他（她）們彼此點首含笑，也不分什麽下江人四川人，從未有過的和睦說親熱，共同的闊步在那條熱爾的街道上，相互的歡欣鼓舞。</p>
<p>其他的各地如西安，蘭州，昆明，貴陽等地，也和重慶成都一樣的狂歡。</p>
<p>在那時，我們想像祖國未來的前途眞是不可預測的遠大。</p>
<p>一年來，勝利以后所表現的種種，不竟令人心酸！</p>
<p>沒有祖國的政黨，與人民為敵，蘇經難民滿佈各地，交通無法恢復，社會秩序不得安寗，貪污舞弊陸續發生，弄得人民不能安居樂業。這一連串的不幸，一年以前誰又會料到呢！</p>
<p>今天，是勝後的第一個「八一三」，復員與建國工作已開展一年，然而，一切是空虛的，一切是凌亂的，我們為了紀念這個神聖的日子—「八一三」，我們熱望，祖國的土地上，再不容許有任何人製造內戰，破壞和平建國，再不希望聞到火藥的氣味，而且，對於一切消遙法外的附逆之流，要澈底嚴辦！對所有為國家捐軀殉難將士的遺孤要切實有所保障！我們不忍每個人為勝利而覺得空虛，而健忘了歷史上的日子「八一三」！</p>
<h3>變戲法</h3>
<p>— 雙人</p>
<p>戲法人人會變，各有巧妙不同。我國的朝野上下，會變戲法的太多了。越是高級的人，戲法越是會變；還有大腹賈，也是變戲法的能手。</p>
<p>上面的話怎講呢？大槪變戲法雖是千變萬化，槪括說一說句：不外「有」「無」兩個字；非「自無而有」，便是「自有而無」。</p>
<p>高級人在登台以前，兩手空空，一登龍門，聲價十倍，於是洋房汽車，嬌妻美妾，應有盡有，尤其是保險裏，五光十色，花花綠綠，令窮措大見之，舌撥不下。豈不是「自無而有」的戲法嗎？</p>
<p>如其貪污出了亂子，人民告發，法院偵查，祗要職位顯赫，自會官官相護。結果是「查無實據」。這就是「自有而無」戲法的一種。</p>
<p>假使各方面對這案不能諒解，偏要「老虎頭上拍蒼蠅」；甚至監察院也看不過去，派員調查；如果查有實據，提出彈劾；那末還有兩個碰急令牌的最後辦法：一個是失火，一個是失竊，可以把有的變成無影無踪，一片糊塗賑。這也是「自有而無」的大套戲法，不過非到末塲壓軸戲，是不肯輕易演出的的。</p>
<p>有人問：「失火與失竊，有事實可據嗎」？筆者答道：「當然有事實的。各地接收的敵偽物資倉庫，不是常常失火嗎？上海前工部局的一部分案卷，不是忽然失竊了嗎？」歸根結果一句話：「變戲法總非國家的好現象」？</p>
<h3>一笑</h3>
<p>— 葛春良</p>
<p>芝加哥的吉白先生和七海的李保先生在避暑的沙灘上遇到了，過了二個星期便互相成為非常知己的好朋友了。在預備回去時，李保一定要請吉白在回到芝加哥去之前，先跟他到七海去遊玩去。於是，吉白在李保家中玩得很快樂，吃得很舒服。過了數天，在星期一早晨，吉白發現在他的晨餐盤中是一張四十元錢的帳單。「那眞正豈有此理，是你自己一定要我來住一星期的，你不請，我怎麽會來呢，現在郤要算起賬來了，那有這種道理」。</p>
<p>「當然要錢」，李保說，「否則我為什麽要請你來呢」？</p>
<p>爭論越來越厲害，越激烈了，最後，李保說，「我告訴你，我們應該怎樣解決這件事，讓我們到猶太法官那裏去讓他來判斷吧」！吉白終於順從了。於是他們一同到本地的猶太法官那裏把完全的案子的情形告訴了他，他非常謹愼地把這事詳細的聽清楚了，然後說，「吉白應該付出那四十元錢來的」。那芝加哥人憤怒極了，可是為了自己答允讓人家判斷的，祇得把四十元錢，在出來時，交給了李保。</p>
<p>「誰要你這錢呀？我做夢也沒有想到要拿你這錢呀」！李保說。</p>
<p>「什麽意思呀？」那朋友被弄得莫明其妙了。</p>
<p>「七海的名勝古跡都已經陪你玩暢了」。李保說：「現在我不過讓你見職見識七海地方的猶太法官是怎樣的一個赫赫有名的混蛋呀！</p>
<h3>「八一三·罷一餐！」</h3>
<p>— 新方</p>
<p>「八一三」這一紀念日，在中國的歷史上，甚至在世界的歷史上，將永是上海人留下的最偉大·最燦爛的一頁。</p>
<p>現在抗戰雖然已獲勝利，中國却走上了一條更艱難的途上，怎樣收拾戰後的殘垣？怎樣開始我們的建設工作？上海人應該用「八一三」的精神替未來的新中國創下更光榮的成績，但是迴首看看今日上海的情形則誠覺痛心；上海人好像都忘了「八一三」，亦忘了他們自己對於祖國應盡的責任；「中國饑荒，上海跳舞」這不是一句批評上海人最痛快的話嗎？</p>
<p>中國的前途一定是光明的，上海人亦決不會忘掉「八一三」的，在今年紀念「八一三」的時候，我希望上海人都會來一次「罷一餐」運動，「八一三」與「罷一餐」的諧音相同，但最大的意義還是希望一般上海人士能够節省一些個人的消費而已，我們不必餓一餐，但至少每一個有能力的上海人該捐出一餐的費用，那麽集腋成裘，就有很多的工作可幹了！</p>
<p>「八一三」是光榮的一日，但「八一三」的光榮是需要上海人自己來負責保持。</p>

<h3>向做父親的購幾句話（下）</h3>
<p>— 周尚</p>
<p>二，品德陶冶—「行有餘力，則以學文」我國自古重德。而今道德「告假」，人心陷溺，父親對兒女的品性行為要格外的化些功夫，尤要助學校訓練的不足。家庭是唯一的品德陶冶的塲合，家庭敎育是唯一的品德陶冶的塲合，家庭敎育即是德育，禮是嚴肅的，以父親為代表，故曰「嚴父」，樂是和諧的，以母親為代表，故曰「慈母」，配合得非常有道理。兒女見到父親要發生威嚴而尊敬，但不可使他們生怕懼心，怕懼了會產生說謊和欺騙等不良行為。最要緊的是以身作則，操守，出處，語默，對人，對手，對事，都守住道德標準。對自己的愛妻，對救國的三民主義，要絕對絕對信仰。兒女在前面如此，不在前面也如此，始終一貫如此，自能潛移默化。義利要分辦得清，對金錢尤其要改改態度。培根說，「金錢是個好僕人，但是一個最壞的主婦」，千萬要摒棄拜金主義。「邦無道，富且貴焉，恥也，」這句話，該詳細解釋給小輩聽。</p>
<p>三·學問培養—吾國傅統似乎把敎的一呈放在父親肩上，因此有「養不敎，父之過」的三字經出現。若以母敎成名的人，便特別頌揚了，母親就大出風頭。迨產業革命後，近代式都巿形成，父親敎子的事放了手，都交給了學校。時至今日，許多父親無力把兒女送入學校，還須勞社會人士慷慨解囊，事實上仍舊有大批大批的兒女望校興嘆。而學校敎育又缺點太多，「死讀書，讀死書，讀書死」，是頂大的毛病。為父者宜常與學校聯絡，推動活敎育，啓發兒女創造力，解放兒女的頭腦·雙手·嘴巴和時空，以從事於創造的工作。在民主生活中學習民主，敎兒女懂得實現三民主義，即是實行了民主主義和社會主義。兒女的個性，只有父母最知道，也許父親知道得最清楚。「知子莫若父」一句話，是不錯。應從個性中敎以做適應社會性的學問，以配合將來的職業。中國古書不能不讀，外國的科學不能不迎頭趕上。小學時代不必把他的頭腦像沙田魚般塞得無空隙餘地，待他們多一些自由活動機會，到了中學時代那非受硬性的嚴格敎育不可了。</p>
<p>四·婚姻指導—婚姻不單是男女的終身大事，也是下一代的終身大事，更是民族的終身大事。中庸載：「天地之道，造端乎夫婦」，坐實了婚姻的重要性。婚姻指導基於性敎育。有不少老師自己還沒成婚，怎能担當起這個責任？學校學生眾多，不易個別指導，所以性敎育最適當的老師還是父母，最適當的環境就是家庭。性敎育在西洋有改稱為「社交衛生」（Socia　Hygiene），這裏含有種族的生物基礎，具有遺傳和優生的作用。吾國往昔配婚，注重「門當戶對」。也許就是這個意思。吾國又倡「男子三十而娶，女子二十而嫁」，對於工理更是合理的，早婚是民族自殺，已經害過我們了。性敎育要從幼開始，倘在青年期突如其來，往往引起感情作用，也許比不敎還壞。敎時不太多，不太少，老老實實，簡簡單單，這要準備，要涵養，要能隨機應變，觸景生情。「性」像吃飯穿衣一樣，沒什麽鬼鬼祟祟的。羅素說得好：「要打破淫穢，先要打破神秘」。我是主張一夫一妻「專愛」的人，在心理學上，專愛可以學成習慣的。我每對我的八個兒女說：「結婚前，多講理智，少講愛情；結婚後，多講愛情，少講理智」。這樣，天下就可减少離婚的悲劇。愛的心理：幼時是自我愛。小學時「同性愛」，此時男女間常形成敵對行為，迨進入初中時期，便開始「異性愛」了。有許多愛的反常，大多在幼時造成的，例如打屁股之類。</p>
<p>「父道」是父親節中一根骨幹。假使父親節而忽略父道，那剩下來的僅是一些浮光掠影的活動，熱鬧了一塲，生不住根的。為了家恨，為了國仇，為了全民族的建設，我們要提倡「父道」。</p>

<p>慶祝上海巿第一屆巿參議會成立紀念</p>
<h3>奠定眞正民主基石　踏上憲政實踐階段　為四百餘萬巿民謀福利</h3>
<p>— 本報記者　張蔭槐</p>
<p>「八一三」是上海巿歷史上一個重大的轉捩點。九年前的今天，抗敵的怒火隨着戰火燃遍上海。九年後的今日，上海第一個眞正的民意代言機關宣告成立。</p>
<p>憲政的燦爛火炬，在四百五十萬巿民的面前照耀着最初曙的光。</p>
<p>戰前光榮歷史回顧　經常檢討槪算預算</p>
<p>話還得說回來：上海之有民意代言人，原不自今日始。戰前本巿已有臨時巿參議會之設立，那時的議員杜月笙，王曉籟，徐永祚，汪伯奇等人。其中並有已故的虞洽卿，王一亭，有在西南天空中被日寇擊斃的浙江興業銀行總經理徐新六，也有被日本特務在滬擊斃的滬江大學校長劉湛恩。也有今日已成問題人物的吳蘊齊，聞蘭亭等人。他們經常舉行會議，通過上一年度的槪算討論巿財政的預算，或者舉行茶會招待一些中外政治外交方面的貴賓。</p>
<p>八年血戰中，忠貞不二的民意代言人當然也隨了國軍西撤大後方，上海變了孤島，變了沒有天日的魔域。敵寇的槍刺下，當然也有他們的那一套。許建屏翦建午那般焹魎蛇豸，紛紛出現——但這是無損於大上海巿政上固有的光輝在四百五十萬巿民的心中依然是雪亮的，反而認清了那些傀儡們的眞相。</p>
<p>大會主席吳巿長</p>
<p>恢復巿民代言機構　臨參會即宜告成立</p>
<p>勝利肅清了這些跳樑小醜。上海巿民要恢復他們自己的代言機構。因此，卅五年二月，巿府奉考試行政兩院令，積極籌辦公職候選人檢　，繼即舉辦各級民意機關代表選舉。全巿首先清查戶口，整編保甲，三月廿八日，巿臨時參議會即告成立。</p>
<p>巿臨時滲議會是民選參議員在客觀環境限制之下，未正式產生前的一個過渡機關。議員雖係由政府指派，但其中人選，包括了金融，工商，新聞，敎育，文化各界，俱為足孚眾望的一時之選。人數百五十名，議長為徐寄　，副議長奚玉書。自卅日首次會議後，會期兩週內，每日有各機關報告，及各臨參員之熱烈質詢。大會於四月十日閉幕，十一日並發表宣言。</p>
<p>巿臨參會閉會後設有駐會委員會。該會是巿政的建議人，也是監察人。無論在防疫，警衛等方面均曾盡過最大的言責。</p>
<p>民意選舉巿參議員　各方熱烈參加競選</p>
<p>四月初旬，巿府即從事籌備民意選舉巿參議員之工作。本巿共分卅一區，及商會，工會，農會，敎育會及自由職業團體等五類，分別進行。全巿選民二百五十餘萬人，準備就千餘候選人中，選舉出他們的代表來。候選人事先亦多紛紛作競選的演講，播音，或其他方式之宣傅，空氣空前熱烈。巿府參事黃華，汪竹一，並專向巿長呈請辭職，以便參加競選，於此亦可以覘見各方參加競選之熱烈。</p>
<p>各區巿民分頭投票　巿參議員全數選出</p>
<p>四月廿八日，是大選的一日。自晨迄暮，選民分頭投票。錢前巿長也於晨九時許，投下他的一票。雖然，這中間曾發生了一些小小的不幸事件，譬如虹橋區發生歐爭，普陀區搗毀玉佛寺，榆林區發生包辦選票以致互歐等等情事，然而第一屆巿參議員一百八十一人，畢竟選出了。</p>
<p>這一百八十一位巿參議員中，以蓬萊區當選人挑慕蓮最年高，為六十八歲。榆林區田怡庭及洋涇區賈德超最年輕，俱二十八歲。女性參議員僅六人（候補者未計在內）。已故一人，為十二區翁　光。</p>
<p>現在，巿參議步已定於今日上午九時在大西路前德國小學舉行成立大會奠下了上海民主化巿政的新的基石。憲政已踏上實踐階段。希望一百八十王位巿參議員善自運用全滬選民所托付的權力，奠定憲政運動的堅實的基石，為全國民意表現作偉大的楷模，為四百五十萬巿民謀福利。</p>
<p>院轄巿參議會置秘書長一人，省轄巿巿參議會，置秘書主人一人，秘書一人或二人，事務員三人至九人，均由議長遴用之。必要時得向巿政府調用人員。</p>

<h3>Lushan Summer Camp Commemorative Week: Chairman's Instructions on the Essentials of National Reconstruction, Seize the Opportunity to Implement Disciplined Living</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Guling, 12th] Chairman Chiang held a tea party at his official residence at 5:30 PM on the 12th, summoning Central Committee members He Zhonghan, Liu Keshu, Li Jingzhai, Gu Zhenggang, Lai Lian, Deng Wenyi, Yuan Shouqian, Deputy Secretary-General of the Central Propaganda Department Lu Qixin, and Deputy Director of the Summer Camp Liu Jianqun. From the 13th to the 15th, the Chairman will personally attend the Summer Camp from 4:20 PM to 5:20 PM each afternoon to conduct roll call of the students, one or three brigades each day.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Guling, 12th] Chairman Chiang personally attended the Summer Camp at 9:00 AM on the 12th to preside over the Commemorative Week address. Other attendees included Chief of General Staff Chen Cheng, Education Director Jiang Jingguo, and over 900 officers and students of the camp. After the formalities, the Chairman began his address, which can be divided into three points: (1) Seize the Opportunity: Although the eight years of arduous resistance against Japan have passed, the future national reconstruction will be even more difficult than the eight years of resistance. It has been a year since the victory, and we have endured all kinds of hardships during this year. However, we believe that history cannot be erased, and this opportunity is the most difficult period in the last fifty years, but it is also a rare opportunity. This has never happened before, and it will never happen again. Therefore, we must seize this opportunity to contribute to the country at this time. (2) The overall plan for national reconstruction has been clearly elaborated in Dr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings and does not need to be repeated. What I want to encourage you today is that I hope you will follow Dr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings and work in a down-to-earth manner. (3) Life must be disciplined, hardworking, thrifty, and simple. The reason why our country cannot become strong is that the bureaucratic habits are too strong, corrupt, and extravagant. You must know that thrift is more important than production, and extravagance and corruption are the factors that destroy a country. I am willing to be a role model for you in terms of lifestyle, and I hope everyone can do it. Without a disciplined life, one cannot establish a family and career, and cannot even be a human being.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Guling, 12th] Chen Guofu and Chen Lifu arrived in Guling from Nanjing at about 4:00 PM on the 12th to give lectures at the Summer Camp.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Guling, 12th] Chairman of Gansu Province Gu Zhenglun arrived in Guling from Nanjing on the 12th to report to Chairman Chiang.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 12th] Youth Party leader Zeng Qi, accompanied by Liu Dongyan, a standing committee member of the party's central committee, flew to Xunyang and then to Guling at 8:00 AM on the 12th to meet with Chairman Chiang. It is reported that Zeng and Liu will stay in Lushan for about a week before returning to Nanjing.</p>
<h3>US Envoys Continue to Mediate, Frequent Contact with Both Sides, Zhou Enlai's Words are Contradictory</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 12th] Ambassador Stuart visited Marshal Ma at 9:00 AM this morning to convey Zhou Enlai's attitude expressed during last night's talks. He returned to the embassy at 10:30 AM and met with Yu Dawei for about an hour. After Ambassador Stuart left Marshal Ma's residence, Zhou Enlai visited Marshal Ma at 11:00 AM and did not leave until about 1:00 PM. In the afternoon, Marshal Ma visited Ambassador Stuart again at the embassy and did not leave until 6:45 PM. At 7:00 PM, Yu Dawei visited Ambassador Stuart again and did not leave until 8:30 PM. Political negotiations seem to be showing frequent contact under the efforts of both Stuart and Marshall.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 12th] It is reported that the meeting between Ambassador Stuart and Zhou Enlai was to discuss the Anping Incident. The meeting between Zhou Enlai and Marshal Ma was for Zhou to express the Communist Party's attitude towards the negotiations after the Communist Party issued a statement on the joint statement by Stuart and Marshall.</p>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 12th] Ambassador Stuart had lunch with Minister of National Defense Bai Chongxi this afternoon. According to the Ambassador, they discussed "other matters" during the lunch, but it is generally believed that they discussed the spreading civil war.</p>
<p>According to sources from the Communist Party delegation, the Communist Party refuses to consider withdrawing from the five areas of northern Jiangsu and Jehol and firmly stated that it will not accept it.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 12th] All Tokyo newspapers published the statement by Special Envoy Marshall and Ambassador Stuart on the morning of the 12th in a prominent position, attaching great importance to it and expressing disappointment.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 12th] During Zhou Enlai's meeting with Stuart last night, Zhou expressed deep gratitude for their efforts and hoped that they would continue to work for peace in China. The Ambassador said that he was sincerely willing to work on mediation but hoped that the two sides' opinions would be closer. He also asked whether the Communist Party could make some concessions. Zhou said that he could consider it. At this point, Ambassador Stuart believed that the door to peace had not been closed. Therefore, after visiting Marshal Ma, Stuart decided to postpone his trip to Peiping to wait for an opportunity to negotiate. However, tonight, the spokesperson of the Communist Party office denied the four words "can consider" and firmly stated that there was no intention to consider.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 12th] Ambassador Stuart interviewed a reporter from the Central News Agency alone on the morning of the 12th, elaborating on his attitude towards peaceful negotiations. The Ambassador said: "We are now looking forward to the progress of the negotiations. I will not give up hope until we believe that there is nothing we can do."</p>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 12th] Shao Lizi, Secretary-General of the National Political Council, told the United Press here today that he hoped that Special Envoy Marshall would continue to mediate and promote peace in China. Once the dispute between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party is resolved, the US military should withdraw from China because at that time, the mission of the US military in China will have been completed. He believes that US aid to the National Government does not prolong the civil war, but China must resolve its internal disputes, otherwise, "economic destruction is possible."</p>
<h3>Zhou Enlai Said:</h3>
<p>Requesting the Security Council to Mediate</p>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 12th] This evening's newspapers here reported that Zhou Enlai said that unless American mediators can solve China's internal problems, the CCP will ask the Security Council of the United Nations to mediate. This statement has not been confirmed, and the CCP spokesperson refused to comment on it.</p>
<h3>Wu Zhihui Fell Off the Bed, Decided to Abandon the Trip to Guling</h3>
<p>Li Shi Invited to Arrive in Guling</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Guling, 12th] Central Committee members Li Shizeng, Duan Xipeng, and Ye Xiuxue arrived in Guling at 2:30 PM on the 12th. According to Li, he and Mr. Wu Zhihui were invited by Chairman Chiang to Guling to spend the summer, but because they were waiting for Mr. Wu to recover from his illness, they were delayed in starting their journey. The night before, Mr. Wu suddenly fell from the bed to the ground and decided to abandon the trip to Guling, so he could only come to the mountain alone in response to the invitation. He also said that he had been burying himself in compiling the World Encyclopedia recently and rarely asked about foreign affairs.</p>
<h3>Minister Chen Arrives in Guling for Talks, Still Optimistic About the Future of Negotiations, But the Threat Factors Must Be Removed First</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Guling, 12th] "The future of peaceful negotiations is still optimistic." This was the reply made by Chen Lifu, Minister of the Central Organization Department, when he arrived in Guling on the 12th when asked by reporters about "the reaction to the joint statement by Special Envoy Marshall and Ambassador Stuart." The reporter asked why he saw it that way. Chen replied that the government's goal is to resolve domestic disputes through political means. According to the resolution of the CCP Central Political Bureau on the 19th, the CCP seems to regard it as a means. As long as the goal has not changed, then the means can still be used for a while. Therefore, negotiations are still optimistic, but it is hoped that the CCP will change the means to the goal, then the two sides will work towards the same goal, and naturally, they will get closer day by day. Asked: Why can't peaceful negotiations reach an agreement? Answer: There are two factors that threaten peace: (1) Transportation is not restored, (2) The army is not reorganized. To seek peace, the threatening factors must be removed first. If a more scientific method can be adopted to write in black and white the date on which a certain section of transportation will be repaired and open to traffic, the date on which the army at a certain place will be concentrated and reorganized at a certain place, and the two sides will implement it in accordance with the regulations, then a third party can judge right and wrong. Otherwise, empty talk will be useless, and the evaluators will have no basis for judgment. Talking about peace every day without working hard to eliminate the factors that threaten peace is just a waste of time, but delaying time may be what the Communist Party is seeking. Asked: After the Communist army withdraws from northern Jiangsu, what are the Minister's views on the nature of local administration? The Minister smiled and told the reporter that northern Jiangsu is about to be submerged due to the Communist Party's breaching of the dikes, and the people cannot survive. The nature of local administration is probably no longer a problem. The reporter finally asked if Zhou Enlai had replied. The Minister replied no, and said that the Communist Party has mobilized domestic and foreign newspapers and publications to attack me for a full three years, and I have never counterattacked once. Because Zhou Enlai recently publicly slandered me too much to Chinese and foreign journalists, I had to counterattack. I still hope that the Communist Party will change its attitude as soon as possible, be sincere and trustworthy, and not regard the world as very foolish and can be played with. You must know that God will not bless a person who is always lying.</p>
<h3>The Course of Negotiations is Like Climbing Guling</h3>
<p>Luo Jialun's Speech</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Guling, 12th] After the Marshall-Stuart joint statement was issued, reporters visited Luo Jialun, former president of National Central University, Cheng Tianfang, former president of Sichuan University, and Lai Lian, former president of Northwestern University, who were in Guling, to solicit their opinions. They all believed that from the joint statement, we admired the futility of the two gentlemen's efforts for peace in China. The joint statement reported on the current status of peaceful negotiations and the crux of the difficulties. With the enthusiasm and patience of the two gentlemen, they will surely continue to fulfill their mission. Mr. Luo also said: "As I am in Guling, I can give an example to illustrate that the course of peaceful negotiations is like climbing Guling. It seems easy to walk only a hundred steps, but in the middle, it becomes more and more difficult. When you are about to reach the top of the mountain, you are exhausted and powerless, but the clear weather and blue sky are welcoming us there."</p>
<h3>National Army Recaptures Jiaoxie in Rugao, Communist Army Attacking Lingtang Bridge Has Been Repelled</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Jiangyin, 12th] The Communist army that attempted to attack Lingtang Bridge again from Gaoyou has been repelled. Small groups of Communist troops north of Yangtai Road are still very active. They destroyed the bridges near Guangfu Bridge the night before, but they have been repaired by the National Army.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Taixian, 11th] It is confirmed that the National Army in Rugao recaptured Jiaoxie yesterday. The area is located 18 li east of Libao.</p>

<h3>Communist Army Attacks Jingxing and Huolu, The Situation on the Zhengtai Railway Becomes Tense, The Communist Army in the Border Area of Hebei and Henan Attacks the Longhai Railway Line</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 12th] The battle situation near Datong can be summarized as follows: Since August 3rd, the Communist army has attacked Datong from the southeast in several routes. The situation is extremely critical. After our blocking attacks, the situation has eased. On the night of the 8th, the Communist army attacked Shacen fiercely with more than ten cannons, but the airport is still in our control. To the west of Datong, the situation is quiet. The closest point of attack on Datong is only three kilometers from the city, and the battle has approached the suburbs.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Tianjin, 12th] The eastern section of the Zhengtai Railway is becoming tense. The Communist armies of the 8th, 35th, and 50th corps are attacking Jingxing, Huolu, and other stations near Niangziguan, and the situation is tense.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 12th] The Communist army on the border of Hebei, Shandong, Henan, and Anhui launched an attack from the Heze area in three routes on the 10th, attempting to attack the three counties of Lanfeng, Kaocheng, and Minquan. Each force has more than 10,000 people and is currently in contact with the troops stationed in each area. In addition, 5,000 Communist troops attacked Luowang Station and engaged in fierce fighting.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tianjin, 12th] Traffic on the Zhengtai Railway is cut off, and relief supplies to Shanxi are blocked.

<p>[Central News Agency, Datong, 12th] The Communist army entrenched east of Datong has recently formed four battalions of Japanese prisoners of war, each equipped with four mountain guns, totaling more than 1,500 officers and soldiers, as the vanguard for attacking Datong. In addition, the Communist army has forcibly conscripted more than 20,000 civilians near Datong to be responsible for transportation and preparations for attacking the city.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 12th] The Longhai Railway's Xuzhou-Bian section has been suspended since the 11th due to the destruction of Huangkou, Yanglou and other stations by the Communist army.</p>
<h3>Northern Jiangsu Refugee Relief Association Asks the CCP Not to Breach Dikes Again</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Zhenjiang, 12th] The Northern Jiangsu Refugee Relief Association held its sixth meeting at 9:00 AM on the 12th and decided: (1) Send a telegram to Zhou Enlai via the CCP leaders, stating that the breaching of the dikes by the Communist Party has led to an increase in the number of refugees in northern Jiangsu, making relief work more difficult. Please do not engage in such atrocities in the future. (2) Send personnel to the recovered areas of northern Jiangsu to comfort the refugees. (3) The standing committee members and group leaders of the association will go to the 35 shelters in the city on the morning of the 13th to offer condolences.</p>
<h3>Soviet-Mongolian Communist Military Agreement Has Been Concluded in Zhangjiakou</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 12th] According to information obtained by well-informed sources, a military agreement has been concluded between Zhangjiakou and the Soviet Union and Mongolia. The Soviet-Mongolian army will provide military assistance to the Communist army in the area and station troops in certain areas of Inner Mongolia. According to the information, in early May (around May 8th or 9th), a Soviet-Mongolian military delegation of five people, led by General Su Yuhamaf, including Mongolian Foreign Minister Hamasuo Nuo, Assistant Diplomat Nana Bao, and Translator Er Caiqin Lumu, arrived in Zhangjiakou and held a military agreement meeting. The Communist Party was represented by Nie Rongzhen and Song Shaowen, and Inner Mongolia was represented by Yun Ze, Kui Ju, Suo Dengnamu, Yunlong Sabu, and Pi Leinuoerbu. They discussed military mutual assistance between Inner and Outer Mongolia and the division of garrison areas. The agreement is as follows: (1) Outside the Great Wall area, the Soviet-Mongolian army will station three divisions of more than 45,000 soldiers in Doron Nuur Banner, Pingdingpu, East and West Ujimqin Princes' Palaces, East Ashan Hajir Banner Princes' Palace, Xiade (i.e., Jiabu Temple), Shijiang, Dayu, and the Princes' Palace of the Sizi Tribal Banner, and all passages bordering Inner and Outer Mongolia. (2) The Mongolian and Han civilians of Chahar and Xilin Gol leagues will be trained by the Soviet Union and Mongolia at the same time. (3) New military training will be provided by the Soviet Union and Mongolia with modern new equipment. (4) When military actions are necessary, the defense of the jurisdictional boundaries of Chahar and Xilin Gol leagues will be increased. (5) The Soviet Union and Mongolia will supply weapons to the Communist army in the Chahar and Suiyuan Mongolian jurisdictions, preside over training, and designate garrison areas. (6) The princes of the Mongolian banners must accept three to five Soviet-Mongolian military and political advisors and liaison officers. Nie Rongzhen and Song Shaowen have signed the agreement, but Yun Ze and Kui Xu believed that the conditions did not comply with the conditions for Inner Mongolian independence and did not sign it at that time. They promised to convene a meeting of the princes of the leagues and banners of Inner Mongolia to negotiate and vote before signing it again. After the Soviet-Mongolian representatives left Zhangjiakou on May 10, Yun Ze and others, under the instigation of Nie Rongzhen, did not convene a meeting of the princes of Inner Mongolia and were criticized by Nie and Zhu for believing that Yun Ze's motion on the envoy's seat was intended to undermine the friendly relations between the Communists and the Soviets. Later, on the 16th, Xu was sent as a special envoy to visit Outer Mongolian Chairman Juan Balasan and Soviet Ambassador to Outer Mongolia Ivanorf to discuss the Soviet Communist military mutual assistance and the division of garrison areas. He returned to Zhangjiakou on the 23rd. On the 29th, the Soviet-Mongolian delegation also added Outer Mongolian Deputy Minister of Internal Affairs Tuoleke and held a meeting after arriving in Zhangjiakou. The attendees included representatives from the eight banners of Chahar League, the five parts of Xilin Gol League, and the six banners of Ulanqab League, including Yun Ze, Kui Ju, Keli Gengsongjin, Wangchuk Ulan, Tian Xiean, Chai Jiayatu, Batan Suotenason, Zhama Danba Chong, Xin Qianhu, Suodengnason, Yunlong Sasu, Pi Qin Nuoerbu, Wu Luojina Sheng, and Ling Dongwen. The resolutions are as follows: (1) Same as the first resolution, but the Soviet-Mongolian border will not be defended temporarily. (2) Divide the Soviet army's garrison areas and military assistance and other contents. (A) The Soviet army's garrison areas are from Doron Nuur, north of Shangdu River, Pingdingpu, Youmage Temple, Jiabu Temple, Tumulutai Sizi Tribe, Xilamulun River, etc., and also military defenses in the residences of the northern Mongolian people. (B) Provide military assistance to Chahar when necessary. (C) Defense of the Saling River. The meeting lasted for three days, and the delegation flew back to Kulun on June 4th.</p>
<h3>Investigation of the Anping Incident, US Military Written Report</h3>
<p>The Group Decided to Study Outside the Meeting</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 12th] The 25-member group investigating the Anping Incident held a meeting as usual on the 12th and adjourned without results as usual. Although the US member Robertson had drafted the investigation procedures and obtained the consent of the government member Zheng Jiemin, the Communist member Ye Jianying needed to supplement some points and requested instructions from Zhou Enlai. Therefore, the three members have not yet given specific instructions to the 25-member group. At the meeting today, Davis still hoped to hear the Marine Corps report, and Zhang Shuheng, the representative of the Beiping Municipal Government, also believed that hearing the Marine Corps report was an indispensable part of any future investigation procedure. To save time, it is best to hear it as soon as possible. Huang Yifeng, the representative of the Communist Party, was afraid that the group would not be willing to go to the "Liberated Area" to hear the Communist Party's report, forming a default judgment situation. Therefore, before the procedures were decided, he still did not urge to hear the Marine Corps report. As a result, it was decided to study the Marine Corps written report separately outside the meeting.</p>

<h3>Real Situation of the Communist Army Breaching the Dikes in Hebei and Henan, The Flooded Area in Northern Jiangsu Exceeds 500 Square Kilometers</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 12th] It has just been learned that the real situation of the Communist army breaching the dikes in Henan is as follows: (1) In Hebei Province, on July 25, the south bank of the Daqing River near Majiaqiao, 10 kilometers north of Yangcun Town (26 kilometers northwest of Xiongxian), was dug open. On the 27th, the east dike near Baigou (14 kilometers north of Xiongxian) and Gaoqiao (11 kilometers east of Xiongxian) was also dug open, and the city of Xiongxian was flooded. On July 21, the Hebei River dike near Zaofen, 15 kilometers northeast of Cangxian, was dug open, and Cangxian was severely flooded. (2) In Henan Province, at the end of July, the Communist army took advantage of the rising water of the Zhang River to dig open the river dike, causing the flood to flood, and the houses were destroyed. The water depth in Xindianji, about 10 kilometers north of Anyang, and Huilong (about 20 kilometers northwest of Neihuang) reached more than 30 feet. Also, the statistics on the breaching of the dikes in northern Jiangsu show that there were 168 breaches of various sizes (the three locations of southeast of Xuyi and southeast of Suqian Yanghuaji near the west bank of the canal near Pixian are not included), and the flooded area is at least over 500 square kilometers.</p>
<h3>Central Memorial Week</h3>
<p>Xue Dubi Reports on the Yellow River Project</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 12th] The Central Memorial Week was held at the National Government Auditorium on the morning of the 12th. Bai Chongxi presided over the meeting, and Xue Dubi reported on the reorganization of water conservancy agencies and the progress of water conservancy projects, especially the most detailed explanation of the Yellow River restoration and dike closure, which is of greatest concern to the whole country. He briefly stated: Although the Yellow River restoration and dike closure project is scheduled to be completed in one year after the start of the project, it has received the enthusiastic assistance of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) and local authorities, but due to the repeated obstruction of the Communist Party, the surveying work could not proceed smoothly at first, and then the start date of the project was delayed until March of this year, and it encountered major obstacles in the progress, and once almost all the planned parts were suspended. Although it has been restarted with the firm advocacy of Premier Song and the encouragement and assistance of UNRRA, the flood season has arrived, and the most optimistic estimate is that it will have to wait until the end of this year. This chief administrator of the national water conservancy cause seemed to be full of anger when he repeatedly listed various examples of the Communist Party's deliberate destruction of the Yellow River renovation project.</p>

<h3>Communist Troops in Northern Jiangsu Implement Tyrannical Rule; Land Distribution Involves Torture; Those Receiving Land Tremble in Fear</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, This City Report] According to visitors from Xinghua, Northern Jiangsu, Communist troops in Xinghua are actively distributing land, allocating three mu per person. However, in order to actually receive the land, one must obtain an official deed from the "Democratic Government." The stamp tax for obtaining the deed is equivalent to the price of the land. However, ordinary farmers have no choice but to fulfill the so-called "legal procedures," exhausting their remaining savings to provide for the "Democratic Government's" regular tax needs. In order to obtain the property rights of the land, the "Democratic Government" forces existing landowners to hand over all their land contracts, which are then burned in public to strengthen the belief of those who receive land based on population. If the landowners refuse, Communist cadres will take them to the location of the land and publicly interrogate them, forcing them to hand over the contracts. The landowners are then sent to be exposed to the scorching sun, or wrapped in thick cotton quilts to make them feel as if they are in a fire. Such torture is unprecedented in Chinese penal history. All farmers and landowners, whether they receive or give up land, are terrified. Approximately 80-90% of the fields in Xinghua have been distributed, and the amount of revenue collected by the Communist troops is staggering. According to statistics, Xinghua County has 20,000 mu of fields, each mu worth about eight to ten shi of rice.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it is reported that the Communist-controlled areas in Northern Jiangsu are witnessing a very intense struggle. The so-called "Three Capitalist Classes" have fled completely. Recently, internal struggles have also been triggered within the proletariat. The goal is that when those being struggled against are desperate, they only need to join the Communist troops, and any major offenses they have committed can be forgiven. However, laborers who fear struggle do not want to join the Communist troops. In this extremely tense environment, they can only flee, not daring to stay put. As a result, the saying "Money for money, life for life" has become an unsung "ode." The "Anti-Japanese Currency" issued by the Communist troops used to be exchanged at 35 yuan for one yuan of legal currency between spring and summer, but recently it only exchanges for eight to ten yuan. The depreciation of the currency is a sign of collapse.</p>
<h3>Prosperity of the Northeast's Future Depends on Agricultural Development; Zhang Jia'ao Delivers Speech to Agricultural Group</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Shenyang, 11th] Zhang Jia'ao, Chairman of the Economic Committee of the Executive Headquarters, delivered a speech at a banquet welcoming the Sino-American Agricultural Technical Cooperation Group on the 10th. He said: The Northeast is currently at a crucial juncture as it transitions from the puppet Manchukuo regime back to the motherland. In the past, Japan focused on the industrialization of Manchuria and even developed heavy industry, but Manchuria has always been an agricultural region. In total, there are about 7.57 million households in Manchuria, of which 5.44 million are farmers, accounting for about 72% of the total. The population is 45.89 million, of which about 33.42 million are farmers, a similar percentage. This shows that the prosperity of the Northeast people's future is extremely dependent on agricultural development. In the past, the total national income of Manchuria was 6.8 billion yuan, of which 2.8 billion yuan came from agriculture and about 1.4 billion yuan from industry and mining. This further proves the importance of the agricultural sector in the entire economic structure of Manchuria. Currently, about 200 million mu of arable land has already been cultivated in the Northeast, and there are still more than 20 million mu waiting to be cultivated. The annual output of the cultivated land is about 20 million tons. If calculated based on output and cultivated area, the output is only half that of the United States and Germany. The reasons for the low production are: (1) Insufficient fertilizer, (2) Insufficient irrigation, (3) Poor quality of seeds, (4) Shortage of agricultural machinery. If the above shortcomings can be resolved, and modern scientific methods are adopted to improve the system and eliminate pests, the future production will not be difficult to increase by 20%. Adding the uncultivated arable land, the output can reach 44 million tons per year. Currently, out of the 20 million tons of annual output, 16 million tons are consumed by farmers themselves, used as livestock feed, and stored as seeds for the coming year. The remaining 4 million tons can be exported, half of which is soybeans. Assuming that the entire output can be increased to 44 million tons, exports can be increased by 24 million tons.</p>
<h3>Chairman Expresses Confidence in Sino-American Economic Cooperation</h3>
<p>Recent Reply to U.S. President's Letter</p>

In his reply, Chairman Chiang sincerely expressed his agreement with this statement.</p>
<h3>Rushing to Block the Damaged Seawall on the Qiantang River Requires 12 Billion Yuan; Engineering Team is Inspecting the Haining and Haiyan Areas</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Hangzhou, 12th] The newly appointed Director of the Qiantang River Seawall Engineering Bureau, Mao Yisheng, made a statement on the seawall project after arriving in Hangzhou. He said: The Qiantang River is one of the three major river engineering projects in China. The collapse of the riverbank has been a constant threat throughout history, and its disaster is even greater than that of the Yellow River. During the Kangxi and Qianlong reigns of the Qing Dynasty, stone seawalls were built, which have lasted for more than 200 years. Due to years of disrepair, dangerous signs have emerged. The current priority is to rush to block the damaged stone seawalls, which are three kilometers long. It costs 4 million yuan to repair one meter, so the project will cost a huge 12 billion yuan for three kilometers. Half of this amount will be used for emergency construction. The central government has already allocated 2 billion yuan, and 700 million yuan has been spent on emergency repairs. The Executive Yuan has allocated 2 billion yuan for work-relief projects, and the local government is raising 2 billion yuan. The remaining half is still not secured. Considering that the Qiantang River is 243 kilometers long, the current work is only patching up leaks. To completely solve the problem, a fundamental plan is needed to regulate the river channel, making the wide and shallow river surface narrow and deep, and fixing both banks so that seawater cannot pass through the river channel, thus maintaining normalcy. This will facilitate irrigation and transform the land on both sides into fertile soil. After building dams, hydropower can be utilized for electrification in the counties along the river, and the fixed river channel with deeper water can be used for navigation.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Haining, 11th] The Qiantang River Seawall Engineering Inspection Team came to Haining for inspection on the 11th. Our special correspondent also accompanied them. The team members worked all day and have gained an understanding of the Qiantang River's water characteristics. However, Haining County is still very desolate, no different from when our reporter came here three months ago. The provincial government has ordered the county government to move back from Xiashi, and perhaps it will be revitalized by then. The Qiantang River seawall may also depend on the inspection. Team leader Hou Jiayuan and team members Di Haimo and Xue Zhuobin returned to Hangzhou early that day due to urgent matters in Shanghai. The remaining 17 people, including Mao Yisheng, continued the inspection and will go to the Haiyan and Zhapu areas. They will go to Jiaxing on the 13th and return to Shanghai by train.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Haining, 11th] The Qiantang River Dam Engineering Inspection Team inspected the relationship between the rising tide and the dam work at 12:00 noon, and inspected the emergency repair project at 5:00 PM. Our reporter asked team leader Hou Jiayuan and deputy team leader Mao Yisheng whether the autumn tide would have any impact. They said: This is the emergency repair period, which is to solve the immediate crisis. This autumn tide may pose a danger to the stone seawalls. We have prepared manpower to repair them as soon as they collapse, so there should be no problem. The establishment of the Engineering Bureau is to plan for permanent seawall construction. We are currently planning a clever method to stabilize the riverbed. After we return to Shanghai, we will conduct on-site experiments and seek a reasonable construction plan. Construction must begin this winter. As for the Zhapu port, using hydropower for power generation is a larger plan.</p>

<h3>Freight Train Derailed on Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway; Old and Decayed Sleepers Unable to Bear the Load; Repairs Completed That Night, Normal Operation Resumed Today</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] At 1:00 AM yesterday morning, freight train No. 805, which departed from Shanghai to Hangzhou, a total of 32 cars, derailed eight cars in the middle (car numbers 10577, 30500, 50735, 51255, 9558, 10805, 55650, 12725) when it reached less than one kilometer outside Zhouwangpeng Station at around 7:00 AM. Only three escort personnel were slightly injured. After the accident, the stationmaster of Zhouwangmiao Station telegraphed Hangzhou and Shanghai North Station, and urgently dispatched rescue vehicles and cranes to rush to repair. Repairs were completed by 11:00 PM that night, and the train schedules on the Shanghai-Hangzhou line should return to normal today. The cause of the derailment was not sabotage, but the sleepers were old and decayed, unable to bear the load, and broke, causing the rails to lift and the car body to lose its balance, leading to the derailment. After the personnel dispatched by the Transportation, Engineering, and Mechanical Departments return to Shanghai, the situation should be fully understood.</p>
<p>Another report: After the derailment of freight train No. 805, the two slow trains No. 42 and express train No. 24, which departed from Shanghai yesterday morning, were blocked at Chang'an and Xucun stations, respectively. The express train No. 23 from Hangzhou to Shanghai was also blocked at Xieqiao at the same time. After the railway bureau personnel asked the passengers of the two regions to switch, they were still sent back to Hangzhou and Shanghai respectively.</p>

<h3>Welcoming "August 13th" with a New Mood - And Congratulating the Establishment of the Shanghai Municipal Council</h3>
<p>"August 13th," a day that evokes mixed feelings, has arrived again. In the hearts of every Chinese person, they will never forget this day. This is an extremely important day that determines the life of every Chinese person and the life of the entire Chinese nation. The full-scale outbreak of the Chinese Anti-Japanese War, the rise and fall of the Chinese and Japanese nations, and the subsequent shift of the center of gravity in Far Eastern and world politics in the next 30 to 50 years were all determined on this day nine years ago. Today, this day has returned. Japan, and the entire world, are being liberated from the suffering of war and are moving towards a new life. We remember the bitter struggle of the past nine years and first pay our highest respects to Chairman Chiang, who led us in this national struggle. It was due to the wise leadership of our leader that we were able to overcome all difficulties and achieve victory. We also express our condolences and respect to the countless soldiers and civilians who died in the Anti-Japanese War. It is because of their deaths that we have our lives.</p>
<p>War is an ominous event, and traditional Chinese thought does not value martial arts or like war. Our national war of resistance this time was truly a resistance that we had to undertake for the survival of our nation. Now the Anti-Japanese War has been won, but the survival of our nation is still under serious threat. After a long period of bloody battles, the foundation of the country has already been shaken. What we hoped for from the peaceful victory was that the war would end on its own, that the people would have a chance to live and rest, and that the country could be liberated from the suffering of war and move towards rejuvenation and new life. But unfortunately, although our Anti-Japanese War has been stopped for a year, during this year, the Chinese Communist Party, while negotiating with the government, has sent its armed forces to attack everywhere, causing wars to appear in the Northeast, North China, North Jiangsu, and the Central Plains. Our people, who have been through war and chaos, are still suffering the hardships of upheaval and displacement, and have not yet had a chance to live and rest. Who created this situation? Undoubtedly, it is the Chinese Communist Party. The government, for the sake of peace and for the sake of the people, had to be tolerant in order to seek reconciliation. However, the result of tolerance has made the CCP even more intensified. Today, as we commemorate this historic "August 13th," we deeply believe that for the sake of our national survival, our leader will surely be able to lead us through the current difficulties and lead our nation towards national construction and rejuvenation, just as he led our war of resistance in the past.</p>
<p>Indeed, the current signs make people deeply believe that our leader is leading us towards the great road of national rejuvenation with his steadfast spirit. The obstruction of the Communist Party will eventually be overcome. The people will not allow the Communist Party and its followers to come out and obstruct the great cause of national construction. What the people demand is peace and prosperity. Those who violate this popular will will eventually suffer defeat. This is a lesson of history. The government has expressed its willingness to start anew with the people, actively reorganizing and downsizing the military. Some time ago, it also announced the discharge of a large number of active-duty military officers. This is an unprecedented move in modern Chinese history, and its announcement is on the eve of the ninth anniversary of "August 13th," the first anniversary of Japan's surrender, and its significance is even more profound. This is nothing more than an expression of the government's determination to actively seek governance in order to realize the modernization of our national defense and the nationalization of the military. On the other hand, the return of a large number of military officers to their fields of farming has swept away the bad habits of resisting orders and separatism in the past, which is a gratifying phenomenon of China's political democratization. Regarding the efforts in this aspect of political democratization, although the reorganization of the central government has not yet manifested any factual performance due to the obstruction of the Communist Party and its followers, the establishment of local public opinion organs in local governments is a necessary condition for political democratization. In the past year, since the victory, the establishment of local councils everywhere is a sign of this kind of political democratization. Among these councils, the members of the Shanghai Municipal Council have already been elected and are scheduled to be established on this historic "August 13th." We welcome this "August 13th," which has special significance for the citizens of Shanghai, with a new mood of excitement.</p>
<p>The "August 13th" nine years ago was launched in Shanghai, triggering a full-scale war of resistance. Now, after the victory of the war of resistance, on the first "August 13th" after the victory, we see in Shanghai the formal establishment of the Shanghai Municipal Council. This council is the organ of the people of Shanghai. They represent the citizens of Shanghai in participating in municipal affairs. They come from all walks of life, from all parties, or do not belong to any party, and are produced by citizens voting and electing. It is truly the implementation of democratic politics. Shanghai is the largest city in China. In the past, the occurrence of "August 13th" in Shanghai caused a full-scale war of resistance. Today, on the first "August 13th" after the victory of the war of resistance, what Shanghai reveals to the whole country is the establishment of the Municipal Council, the implementation of democratic politics. The spread of this trend, we deeply believe, can also cause a comprehensive impact, making the national politics tend towards democratization, and achieving the true rejuvenation of the nation. Therefore, in the history of the war of resistance, Shanghai has played a leading role. In the history of national rejuvenation, Shanghai should now also play a demonstration and leading role in the country due to the establishment of the Municipal Council.</p>
<p>Therefore, the responsibility of the Shanghai Municipal Council is quite heavy. As a public opinion organ, on the eve of the implementation of constitutional government, we hope that the Shanghai Municipal Council can exert its greatest power. The core of democratic politics is that the people have the final power. Looking at our theory of "power" and "ability," it is the master. Since Shanghai's restoration, the municipal measures have not been without controversy. Now that the Municipal Council is established, it must actively exert its role in supervising the government and set an example for our country's future democratic politics. The war is over. We welcome "August 13th" with a new mood. What it represents is not war, but China's rejuvenation.</p>

<h3>Former U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union Analyzes Soviet Realpolitik (Part 1): He Said Roosevelt Was Wrong</h3>
<p>Former U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union, William Bullitt, in his book "The Great Globe Itself," analyzed in detail the ideology, policies, and real diplomatic background of the Soviet Union. For people who want to understand everything about the Soviet Union, this book seems to be extremely worth reading. The book has five chapters, and what is excerpted here is a small part of the book.</p>
<p>The Soviet Union, as President Roosevelt said in a speech on February 10, 1940, is a "completely dictatorial country, more thorough than any dictatorial country in Europe." A year later, Germany attacked the Soviet Union, and the United States, for its own interests, decided to help the Soviet Union. President Roosevelt was willing to help the Soviet Union in the war without limits, but hoped to persuade Stalin to abandon his outward aggression and adopt democratic politics. Critics pointed out that this was impossible, but Roosevelt did not believe it. As a result, the Soviet Union's actions in Poland, Hungary, Yugoslavia, Germany, Iran, Korea, and Northeast China after the war all proved that President Roosevelt was wrong, although he did not see it himself.</p>
<p>Why does Stalin still do this? The Soviet Union has such a vast territory, a sparse population, uncultivated land everywhere, rich mineral deposits, endless resources, and the people are suffering from war and urgently need to recuperate. So, why is the Soviet government's ambition for expansion still so endless?</p>
<p>To understand this problem, we must first understand the fundamental outward aggression of the Soviet Union. Some of them are due to historical psychological factors, and some are due to dogmas in the doctrine.</p>
<p>(1) Traditional Suspicion</p>
<p>The ancestors of the Russians were the residents of the forests in the Ukraine and the Novgorod-Moscow region. It is a plain with no natural barriers in sight, stretching from Mongolia to Podolia. On this vast and fertile Eurasian plain, since the early days of civilization, there have been successive westward migrations of barbaric peoples. The Russians have always been helpless against this group of invading tribes, and the neighboring tribes in the north, south, and west are all eyeing them covetously. They are often conquered. Their history is a tragic story of a series of wars, famines, suffering, massacres, rapes, and enslavement. In this painful lesson, they learned to regard everyone else as ill-intentioned robbers. Sometimes, they also get along well with neighboring countries, but this is only a temporary "truce." Permanent peace like ours has never existed in their history. Therefore, the Russians have to constantly suspect the powerful countries outside. In their view, in order to survive, they have to use deception and war. On the surface, they get along well with people, but secretly prepare to attack. The traditional historical environment has made them develop this kind of second nature.</p>
<p>(2) Seven Hundred Years of Dictatorship</p>
<p>Throughout Russian history, autocratic dictators have ruled. They have never known what it is like to live under a free order. The totalitarian form of Russian politics was established from 1240 when Batu, the grandson of Genghis Khan, conquered Russia. For two hundred years, Russia was subject to the rule of the Mongols. The Russian nobles were absolutely obedient to the rulers. Russian historian Vernadsky said:</p>
<p>[The Mongolian influence can be seen in all aspects of the Russian political and social system. The Mongolian Khanate was based on the idea of ​​absolute obedience of the individual to the ruler and the state. This idea, as a result, deeply penetrated the blood of the Russians. That is, all classes must perform compulsory service to the state. The Mongols also brought in a new concept, namely the absolute power of the ruler. The authority of the Khan is a brutal force, and obedience is absolute. This concept of the absolute power of the ruler still remains after the fall of the Mongol Empire.]</p>
<p>From the era of Mongolian rule until now, the Russians have become accustomed to living under a totalitarian dictatorship, and it is natural for them to feel that the country is led by a dictator and that they cannot intervene. (To be continued)</p>

It was decided at the International Monetary and Financial Conference that those who suffered excessive losses due to enemy devastation or war could first pay 20% of the total amount, totaling 120 million US dollars. Within this 120 million US dollars, another 0.5% could be paid after five years. Therefore, the actual amount paid this time was 120 million US dollars, minus the 0.5% (3 million US dollars) to be paid after five years, totaling 90 million US dollars. Our country had previously paid the bank's administrative expenses of 60,000 US dollars. Therefore, the settlement this time only required the payment of 89.94 million US dollars. According to reliable sources, this amount was remitted to Washington by the Central Bank in full yesterday. Our country's investment ranks fourth, after the US, Britain, and the Soviet Union.</p>
<h3>Report on the Former Changdao Foreign Firm's Automobile Repair Shop: Concealment of Enemy and Puppet Materials; Members of the Investigation Team Personally Visit Xuan Tiewu; Wang Zhuchen Narrates the Process of Repairing Cars on Behalf</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Since receiving a confidential report from the Korean Sun Tianchangzhi exposing the case of supplying enemy military materials, the Reception and Investigation Team recently received a report that Wang Zhuchen concealed the Japanese Changdao Foreign Firm's automobile repair shop. According to the report, the Investigation Team, after investigation by members Zhang Qingzhen and Wu Wangji, considered the case to be serious and cited the Garrison Headquarters to detain Wang Zhuchen. Members Wu and Zhang specifically visited Xuan Tiewu, Commander of the Garrison Headquarters, for this case. According to Member Zhang Qingzhen's report to our newspaper, there have been new developments in this case recently, and a large number of concealed German expatriate materials have been discovered as a result of this case, with a value of over 10 million yuan. The Investigation Team is still investigating as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>In order to understand the truth of the matter, the reporter specifically interviewed the plaintiff Wu Tianxiang and the defendant Wang Zhuchen. The details are compiled as follows: Wu Tianxiang, originally from Yangzhou, is 58 years old this year. He has been engaged in the automobile business in this city for decades. In the 17th year of the Republic of China, he rented No. 2 Beihaining Road from Cao Baoxiang and opened the Xiangji Sino-American Automobile Company. After the "September 18th" Incident, Wu led his family to take refuge in his hometown of Yangzhou. The Sino-American Automobile Company was forcibly occupied by the Japanese Changdao Chunyi, who established the Changdao Foreign Firm's Automobile Repair Shop. After the victory, it was taken over by the Songhu Garrison Headquarters and managed by Wang Zhuchen, who also engaged in the automobile business and was the designated repair shop for the Garrison Headquarters. After Wu Tianxiang returned to Shanghai, he applied to the police bureau, the Garrison Headquarters, the Enemy and Puppet Property Handling Bureau, and other agencies to have the Sino-American Automobile Company returned. Although it was approved by the authorities, Wang still refused. After several negotiations, he was allowed to move in, but the two rooms downstairs were still filled with enemy-owned automobile materials. Wang took possession of these enemy-owned properties and moved them out to other rooms at night, and set up another manufacturing plant on Chuanguan Highway in Zhabei. According to Wu Tianxiang's report, the batch of materials that Wang Zhuchen recently transferred and concealed included: 600 automobile inner tubes, over 2,200 oil pump pipes, over 2,000 large and small cylinder beds, over 4,300 Kellerzi Lanlin, over 50 Tai Limu, 500 sets of command lights, 600 Pace Dayton, 1,500 fan belts, 900 Exxon locks, over 3,100 purple copper large and small cylinder beds, over 8,000 headlight glasses, 1,800 water tank rubber pipes, 260 pairs of complete headlights, 400 carburetors, 20 automobile motors, over 500 wind belts, over 2,000 chokes, 2,000 Tam chains, 30 Tom Polo, 15 Hali Mu, over 4,000 red copper cylinder beds, over 600 automobile inner tubes, and over a dozen 2-zhang-long thick rubber pipes, the value of which is truly shocking. And the transfer of concealed materials is still continuing.</p>
<p>Wang Zhuchen told the reporter yesterday afternoon that he is a graduate of Tongji University, studied aviation automobile mechanics in Germany, and served in the aviation industry for more than ten years. He was once the director of an aircraft factory. After the victory, he came to Shanghai and co-invested with friends Yu Wei and Hui Yuan to organize the Xinyou Automobile Repair Factory. Because there was no factory site, he borrowed the Changdao Repair Shop from the Garrison Headquarters, and the commissioner of the Ministry of Economic Affairs received the enemy Xingya Steel Factory, which was the designated repair shop for the Garrison Headquarters, repairing cars for free, and the Garrison Headquarters supplied automobile parts and necessary equipment, and showed various certificates, including a certificate on February 28 purchased five trucks from the Enemy and Puppet Property Handling Bureau for 6.1 million yuan. Wang also said: The technicians hired by his factory are all filled by Japanese and German prisoners, and the German Harson Bushi is a technical consultant. Ha has lived in China for more than 30 years and is very proficient in automobile technology.</p>
<h3>Sun Tianchangzhi's Case of Aiding the Enemy: Informant Exposes Crimes</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] In the case of the Korean Sun Tianchangzhi supplying enemy military materials, the informants Zhou Gan, Han Kaiyuan, and Zhou Qingrong hosted the local press at 3:00 PM yesterday afternoon to report on Sun Tianchangzhi's various crimes, which can be divided into six items: (1) Collecting coins on behalf of the enemy, (2) Procuring military hardware and materials for the enemy, (3) Contracting to repair the Jindou arsenal for the enemy, (4) Manufacturing and repairing military equipment for the enemy, (5) Presenting four fighter planes to the Japanese government, (6) Occupying the British-owned Moteli Qin Hang (details have been recorded in our newspaper on August 8). At the beginning of the victory, the informant secretly reported to the relevant authorities, and a large number of military hardware and materials were sealed. Later, the Handling Bureau actually approved the unsealing and return of the materials, and Sun is still at large. Therefore, in addition to submitting a request to the Investigation Team for a thorough investigation, he will soon file a complaint with the judicial authorities and the highest authorities, and will certainly bring this war criminal to justice. Zhang Qingzhen, a member of the Investigation Team, summoned Sun Tianchangzhi to the team's office again at 4:00 PM yesterday afternoon to listen to Sun's defense, which lasted for more than two hours. According to Zhang Zhiben, the head of the country, the Enemy and Puppet Property Handling Bureau should not have lightly returned the sealed materials. The Investigation Team attaches great importance to this case and is currently working hard to collect evidence.</p>

<h3>Inauguration of the Municipal Council This Morning: Representative of the Wu Municipal Department, Minister Zhang, Supervises the Election of the Speaker and Deputy Speaker; Amendment of the Question of Councillors' Attendance Requires Internal Request</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The inaugural meeting of the first Shanghai Municipal Council is scheduled to be held at No. 1 Daxi Road at 8:00 AM this morning. Councillors began reporting on the 10th, and as of last night, there were 174 people. Those who have not yet reported are Wang Xiaolai, Jin Tongyin, Xu Baohua, Zhu Hongyi, Zhu Wenqi, and Ji Yuanpu. Qian Songping, the municipal councillor of the Zhenru District, was elected on the 11th, but he cannot participate because he has not yet reported to the Ministry of the Interior for record. Zhu Wenbin of the Dachang District has already reported and replaced Duanmu Kai, who resigned. The convener and chairman of the conference is Mayor Wu Guozhen, so all invitations to the councillors have the word "Wu Jian" on them. The important section of the inaugural meeting is the election of the Speaker and Deputy Speaker, which will be held and the votes counted on the spot. The supervisor of the election was originally Minister of the Interior Zhang Lisheng, but he was unable to participate due to official business. He has telegraphed Mayor Wu to supervise the election on his behalf. The election method uses an anonymous joint record method, and each person must obtain more than half of the votes of the attendees to be elected. In the event of a tie, it will be decided by drawing lots. In addition, alternate municipal councillors requested to attend and speak. They went to the Municipal Government yesterday morning to petition Mayor Wu. The mayor explained from a legal point of view the reasons why they could not attend and speak. Moreover, in fact, it is impossible to accommodate them all due to the small venue. However, in the end, Mayor Wu still agreed to forward the question of attendance to the Ministry of the Interior for instructions.</p>
<p>[Another Report] Mayor Wu Guozhen visited the Shanghai Municipal Council venue on Daxi Road at around 4:00 PM yesterday afternoon and gave instructions on the layout of the venue. The venue can accommodate about 300 people. There are 18 rows of seats in front of the stage, with ten people in each row, for the councillors. The right side of the stage is for the press, the left side is for guests, and the back is for the audience. There are three rows in front of the councillors for foreign guests, and General Jilin and personnel from the consulates and diplomatic missions of various countries in Shanghai have been invited to participate. The heads of the party, government, military, and organizations of this city, and the members of the Municipal Government Advisory Committee, are also on the list of invitees. As for alternate councillors, the council stated that they can participate in the audience. The council has issued 70 audience passes to alternate councillors.</p>
<h3>Suspected Tomb of Zhao Zhuozhi Found in Dug Graves in Nanjing</h3>
<p>Yesterday's report that the Penglai Road Police Station in Nanjing cracked a case of private excavation of ancient tombs and theft of funeral antiquities stated that the excavated tomb was that of Zhao Wenhua, the Ming Right Political Secretary. The Shanghai Municipal Gazetteer Museum is paying close attention to this matter and has conducted an investigation, which stated: (1) Zhao Wenhua was from Cixi, Zhejiang, and his remains would never be buried in Shanghai, and he never served as the Right Political Secretary. (2) The Shanghai person who served as the Right Political Secretary in the Ming Dynasty was Zhao Zhuo. The county gazetteer states that his tomb was in Xieqiao, which is close to the current excavation site. (3) Zhao Zhuo and Zhao Wenhua were contemporaries, but they did not rely on Yan Song. He Sanwei's Yun Jian Zhi Lue states that "in his twenty years in office, the entertainment of singers and prostitutes never entered his ears, and inappropriate things never entered his residence." (4) The report stated that there was originally an epitaph in the tomb, which has been destroyed. It is a pity that Zhao Zhuo's epitaph was written by Xu Jie and cannot be preserved today.</p>
<h3>The Lives of War Criminals Are Not Bad: Playing Ball to Pass the Time; Citizens Encouraged to Report on Chou Shang-hsi</h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, a reporter took a car to the Jiangwan National Defense Ministry War Criminals Management Office to inquire about the current situation of Japanese residents and war criminals remaining in China.</p>
<p>The War Criminals Management Office was formerly the Prisoner of War Management Committee. Since its affiliation with the Ministry of National Defense, it has expanded its scope of work to become a national institution for investigating and managing war criminals. It is located in Gaojingmiao, Jiangwan. Director Zou Renzhi recently led a supervisory team to inspect the repatriation of Japanese prisoners of war in the Northeast under the ministry's order.</p>
<p>As of now, there are 1,117 Japanese people detained on suspicion of war crimes, most of whom are military police, approximately 700 or more. The Management Office has three detention centers: one in Xiqiushe, Wusong, which is exclusively for military police, and two in Gaojingmiao, which house generals and general war criminals respectively. Some of the detained generals, even though they have become prisoners, still remember their status and request to be accompanied by attendants. Therefore, more than one hundred Japanese who are not suspected of war crimes remain in the detention center to serve them.</p>
<p>These war criminals, except for being strictly prohibited from leaving and entering, enjoy a considerable degree of freedom within the camp. Their food and supplies are paid for by the government, and each month generals receive 800 yuan and soldiers 200 yuan in spending money. They have organized a mutual aid society and spend their time playing baseball and other sports every day. The Management Office holds an internal affairs inspection once a week and publishes a three-day propaganda bulletin, which, in addition to brief news, focuses mostly on correcting their thinking. It is said that the war criminals are very at ease under such management, and many have repented of their past actions. Therefore, some are voluntarily learning the national language, and some are self-reporting.</p>
<p>The War Criminals Management Office has four groups. The first group is responsible for general affairs. The second group is responsible for management, including security and propaganda. The third group is responsible for investigation and evidence gathering. The fourth group is responsible for researching and reviewing data and household registration. Among them are more than 20 Japanese staff members, all of whom were prisoners from the former Military Affairs Department Chongqing Prisoner of War Camp. After eight years of training, they have had a thorough understanding of ideology and are now responsible for organizing data and translating investigative intelligence.</p>
<p>The work of investigating war criminals is still very difficult. In addition to the lack of legally required evidence for many crimes, the Chinese people's fear of trouble and standing out makes it difficult for the work to proceed smoothly. Therefore, the War Criminals Management Office hopes that the people and relevant authorities can provide them with various kinds of assistance so that those war criminals who have committed wrongdoing can be punished as they deserve as soon as possible. Recently, the First Pacification Area Military Tribunal may be affiliated with the Ministry of National Defense, so there may be closer ties for the handling of war criminals in the future.</p>
<p>As for Japanese residents, most have been repatriated. Those currently remaining in Shanghai are so-called "technical personnel" employed by various agencies, together with their dependents, numbering approximately one thousand. The Japanese Residents Management Committee has long been disbanded, and these Japanese are no longer subject to any management except for the constraints of their employing agencies. (Shi)</p>
<h3>Relying on Enemy Power to Bully the People: Wang Xinghuai Sentenced to Eight Years; Pan Da and Ni Nongxiang to Be Sentenced on the 19th</h3>
<p>[This newspaper report] Wang Xinghuai, the head of the plainclothes brigade of the 94th Regiment of the 24th Division of the puppet army, relied on enemy power to harm the local area and bully the people. Yesterday, the High Court sentenced him to eight years of imprisonment and eight years of deprivation of civil rights.</p>
<p>Two cases were concluded on the same day: (1) Pan Da, who held positions such as the Director of the Fourth Division of the Puppet Government's Special Service Headquarters, (2) Ni Nongxiang, Deputy Manager of "Li Tai Bank," in which Li Shiqun and others participated as shareholders. After the debate in both cases was concluded, it was decided that both would be sentenced on the 19th.</p>
<p>Xia Zhongming After being prosecuted by the High Procuratorate, the High Court held its first hearing yesterday afternoon. Xia wore a light gray Paris long gown, with a small checkered cotton short shirt and pants underneath, yellow leather shoes, a slightly curved back, a thin face, and short hair. He stated that he was 45 years old, from Shanghai, a graduate of Tokyo University of Commerce, Japan, and previously lived at No. 16 Zhaofeng Village, Yuyuan Road. Before the war, he was the Chief Clerk of the Shanghai Police Department. After the war, he was the Director of Military Supplies of the Songhu National Anti-Japanese Self-Defense Corps. After being arrested, he joined the puppet organization in August of the 28th year of the Republic [1939], and served as the leader of the Special Service Headquarters, the Deputy Minister of the Puppet Investigation and Statistics Department, and the Director of the Shanghai Office. After being questioned in court and witness Gao Jimin was summoned, the defense lawyer Chen Zhen stood up and provided twelve favorable documentary pieces of evidence. The court ordered a change of date for further questioning.</p>
<p>Feng Jie also underwent a retrial by the High Court yesterday afternoon. He denied that he had served as a member of the Puppet Central Executive Committee and the Deputy Minister of the Puppet Propaganda Department, claiming that he served as a member of the Puppet Relief Committee from December of the 30th year of the Republic [1941] to February of the 31st year of the Republic [1942], and as the Director of the Shanghai Office of the Puppet Propaganda Department in October of the 31st year of the Republic [1942]. He later served as the Director of the Puppet Shanghai Propaganda Department and the General Manager of the "China Film Company" until the victory. The court debate in this case was changed to a later date for further questioning.</p>
<p>On the same day, the investigation of Zheng Chengxue, General Manager of "China Trading Company," who purchased food on behalf of the puppet army, He, Deputy Chief Executive of the Puppet Oil and Food Unified Allocation Office, and Zhang Guangpei, Manager of the Puppet Xinghua Bank in Changsha, Hunan, and member of the Puppet Changsha Municipal Design Committee, etc., were all changed to a later date for further questioning after the questioning.</p>

<h3>Provisional Meeting of the Labor Association's Directors in Shanghai: Recommended Tao Baichuan, etc., to Go to the Capital to Present Four Demands; Sent Personnel to Chongqing to Investigate the Inside Story of the Forced Occupation</h3>
<p>Regarding the illegal occupation of the Labor Association's Chongqing Welfare Society and four affiliated institutions, it is learned that the association convened a provisional meeting of directors in Shanghai at the Atlantic Vegetable Society at 10:00 AM yesterday morning to discuss important handling policies. A total of eleven people attended, including Zhu Xuefan, Zhou Xuexiang, Shui Xiangyun, Tao Baichuan, Li Jianhua, Wang Jiashu, Lu Keming, Gu Xizhang, Wang Zhenbai, and Xiao Pusong. The directors expressed their opinions enthusiastically, and all agreed that the use of force to illegally occupy the association's welfare society and arrest staff members, which infringes on human rights and disrupts social order, not only should the perpetrators bear all legal responsibilities, but also it is necessary to investigate which agency instigated or approved it, and file an administrative lawsuit. (According to the General Labor Union, it was "ordered to take over" and "approved for takeover," etc.) Finally, four resolutions were passed: (1) Send Zhang Tianmin, director of the welfare stock, to Chongqing to investigate the inside story of the forced occupation, rescue the arrested staff members, and question the local authorities. (2) Recommend Tao Baichuan, Zhou Xuexiang, and Zhu Xuefan to go to the capital to petition, requesting: 1. Immediately release the association's arrested service personnel. 2.

Request the government to legally guarantee the safety of the association's staff members and ensure that similar incidents do not occur in the future. (3) Report to Chairman Chiang and the relevant ministries and departments of the central government about the forcible occupation of the Chongqing office and welfare institutions, and make requests. (4) The association's accounts, audited by the accountant (as of July of this year), will be transferred to the Board of Supervisors for review, and the Board of Supervisors will issue a statement to the outside world.</p>

<h3>ERRRA and UNRRA Agreed on a Memorandum Regarding Educational Post-War Rehabilitation: If Educational Institutions in Various Provinces and Cities Need Books and Equipment, They Can Report to the Ministry of Education for Submission to ERRRA for Assistance</h3>
<p>[This newspaper report] Regarding the post-war relief of cultural and educational institutions, the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (ERRRA) has agreed with the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) to assist in the rescue of Taiwan materials and requested the Ministry of Education to instruct all educational institutions across the country to list the books and equipment they need and submit them to the ministry for overall submission to ERRRA for application. Regarding the categories of supplies and the scope of assistance, a memorandum has been agreed upon with UNRRA, and UNRRA has ordered its representatives in various regions to comply. Therefore, educational departments and bureaus in various provinces and cities and other educational institutions can apply directly to the Ministry of Education for books and equipment. The following is a memorandum agreed upon by ERRRA and UNRRA regarding post-war education:</p>
<p>Two Types of Assistance Methods</p>
<p>UNRRA is willing to provide assistance for post-war affairs of educational institutions in various member countries. The assistance methods are divided into two types: (1) Books and Publications: A special fund has been designated to purchase a considerable number of specialist books and publications that contribute to: A. Promoting the country's production and utilization capacity of post-war relief materials; B. Protecting those with intellectual and physical disabilities, pregnant women, nursing mothers, children, and the disabled; C. Prevention and management of infectious diseases; D. Establishment, maintenance, and administration of health and welfare facilities. This plan will continue to receive material supplements due to donations from private organizations. (2) Supplies and Equipment: UNRRA will make every effort to supply laboratories, instruments, machinery, and items related to the following points, which are required for the estimated needs of various countries: A. Experimental supplies for researchers who manufacture post-war relief products; B. Those that ensure that the manufactured products meet standards; C. Training those who manufacture and use products; D. Those who diagnose diseases; E. Medical personnel who receive advanced training. UNRRA can also assist in purchasing and processing other equipment that is applicable and beneficial to the recovery of educational institutions in various member countries. This plan was originally designated to assist universities, but Washington has also instructed that UNRRA is also happy to consider the equipment and materials needed for agricultural post-war rehabilitation in China's free areas and for secondary school refugee schools that can immediately benefit the post-war relief policy. Washington is eager to receive a list of the materials needed in China to determine the extent of assistance UNRRA can provide. Representatives from the Ministry of Education, ERRRA, and UNRRA have formed a joint committee in Shanghai to prepare to compile this application and prepare for the distribution of supplies upon arrival. ERRRA has asked the Ministry of Education to be responsible for surveying the needs of educational institutions across the country, and this work is in progress. Some institutions have already submitted applications to the ministry, and the rest will continue to be launched. ERRRA and UNRRA branch chiefs should immediately assist the preparation of applications for the agencies in their jurisdiction and may appoint commissioners and local university representatives to discuss the required materials.</p>
<p>Four Points to Note</p>
<p>The ERRRA and UNRRA headquarters especially hope to receive reports from individual institutions in various regions, requesting supplies of the above-mentioned books and equipment that are considered to be effective in post-war relief programs. When preparing for this report and discussing with representatives of various agencies or the Ministry of Education, ERRRA and UNRRA personnel should pay attention to the following points: (1) All books and items applied for to UNRRA must be used in educational work related to ERRRA and UNRRA post-war relief programs. (2) The funds for purchasing this equipment must still be included in the original budget of various countries, so the scope of assistance will be limited to the following institutions: A. Educational institutions in liberated areas; B. Institutions that moved inland and returned to their original sites in liberated areas; C. Institutions in free areas whose laboratories were directly destroyed by air strikes. Books are purchased with special funds and are not subject to the above restrictions. (3) All institutions applying for assistance should clearly express their desire and ability to immediately use the books and materials they receive. If institutions whose houses have been destroyed cannot accept and use the distributed materials, their reports should also explain the methods of using the construction and repair costs and the estimated completion date. Reports of difficulties from faculty and staff groups are also welcome. (4) UNRRA will hardly be able to supply sufficient materials and equipment for all the needs of Chinese educational institutions, so a priority allocation method will be established for the types of equipment and among the institutions. Please submit a report on the urgent needs of the institutions in each district to determine the priority.</p>

<h3>Ocean Research Institute: Ministry of Education Telegraphs Tang Shifeng to Discuss Preparations for Establishment; Location Decided in Xiamen</h3>
<p>[This newspaper report from Nanjing on the 12th] In view of the importance of ocean research in our country, the Ministry of Education telegraphed Tang Shifeng, a professor at Xiamen University, to come to Beijing to discuss the preparation for the establishment of the Ocean Research Institute.

Now that the Ministry of Education has established the Marine Research Institute, the location is determined to be Xiamen, and the Ocean Group will be expanded into an institution to continue the group's practical research work to provide teaching materials for our country's aquaculture education. Mr. Tang will return to Xiamen in a few days.</p>

The ceremony was presided over by Director Li, who briefly stated that it is valuable that the national teachers and workers of this city can use the summer vacation to gather to discuss healthy living. This has been a precedent in various European and American countries and has been very effective, so the collective life of this summer camp will definitely have great results. After the chairman finished speaking, Yang Jizhang, representative of Tang Enbo, the commander of the Beijing-Shanghai Garrison Command, gave encouragement to the trainees. Representatives from the police bureau and the chairman of the municipal party committee then gave speeches. Finally, guest Fu Tongxian expressed sympathy for the difficult lives of education workers, saying that China is among the top four most difficult countries, but illiteracy still accounts for 80%, which is very unreasonable. He pointed out that the reason for the current moral decay of society is entirely due to the low level of education in our country.

<h3>Results of Industry and Commerce Petition: Ministries Respond to Fifteen Questions; Important Matters Require Instructions from Highest Authorities</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] In addition to the groups that returned to Shanghai from Nanjing on Saturday afternoon, Sunday morning, and yesterday (i.e., the 12th) morning and noon, another group led by Shou Yicheng and others, the final batch, arrived in Shanghai on the 5:30 PM flight from Nanjing yesterday afternoon. According to them, the journey was arduous and regrettably unproductive. However, the two financial and economic ministries held symposiums, sincerely engaging in discussions with the delegation, which was quite pleasant. Minister Wang, after returning to Beijing on the afternoon of the 11th, immediately invited the delegation for talks. The Ministry of Finance even made an exception to work on Sunday for this purpose, which showed particular (blank). Leaders of the business community in Nanjing, Zhenjiang, and other places responded in unison, encouraging the delegation. The heads of various ministries stated that they would be responsible for resolving the difficulties of industry and commerce, and that given the seriousness of the situation, they would not give empty assurances. However, the more important issues still need to be referred to the highest authorities and discussed with relevant agencies. The results of their petitions, that is, the responses of the heads of various ministries (including the Ministries of Finance, Economy, and Social Affairs), are recorded below. According to news from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, a meeting of the heads of various industries will be convened to report everything.</p>
<p>(1) The organization of the United Relief Agency was established to meet wartime needs. Whether it should be abolished or how it should be improved now that the environment has changed needs to be studied, but it still needs to be submitted to the highest authorities for approval. (2) There should be special funds for industrial loans, as well as incentives for export trade. These matters concern the actual needs of finance and industry and commerce, and should be carefully reviewed by the government and the business community before a decision can be made. Minister Wang of the Ministry of Economic Affairs has paid special attention to loans for small and medium-sized factories and has drafted specific measures. In the future, it is planned to establish industrial and commercial supervision offices in important commercial ports. If implemented, the most effective measures will be taken to cooperate with relevant parties to handle industrial loans. To avoid inflation, in-kind loans will also be arranged as much as possible.</p>
<p>(3) The import tax on non-essential and luxury goods should be increased, and export taxes should be reduced to moderately protect nascent industries. The Ministries of Economy and Finance are revising tax rates. Efforts to strengthen customs anti-smuggling work have also been made.</p>
<p>(4) The foreign exchange grading system and the import and export linkage system have been difficult to implement. However, trials can be conducted within possible limits. The Central Trust Bureau is responsible for the purchase of raw silk, which has been approved by President Song. The purchase of tea leaves concerns barter trade with the Soviet Union and sales to the United Kingdom and the United States, and the same example can be followed in the future.</p>
<p>(5) Regarding the establishment of a rehabilitation and industrial investment company to utilize foreign capital, the principle is feasible. However, the first step should be to guide domestic idle funds into the right track, and the second step is to utilize overseas Chinese and foreign capital.</p>
<p>(6) The draft of the Sino-American Commercial Treaty has been drafted and is under review. There is also a temporary commercial arrangement with Canada. The main purpose is to promote international economic cooperation. Tariff barriers should still be avoided.</p>
<p>(7) The restrictions on mortgage loans for real estate should be relaxed. The authorities will consider and approve mortgage loans for production and construction projects under the premise that they do not hinder current laws and regulations.</p>
<p>(8) Illegal harassment in the collection of direct taxes will be strictly prohibited. The business tax law should levy taxes separately on manufacturing, wholesale, and sales. The authorities are in the process of drafting it. The stamp tax is a certificate tax. Calculating it based on the turnover in the books is obviously inconsistent with the law and should be corrected.</p>
<p>(9) Business license taxes are limited by law to industries that contain regulatory characteristics and require increased control. Any excesses should be stopped.</p>
<p>(10) For goods subject to goods tax that are exported, taxes can be refunded upon export. The new tax law does include cosmetics as a category, but daily necessities are not included.</p>
<p>(11) The request for exemption of business tax for the handmade cotton weaving industry and whether to restrict the import of candies and biscuits will be considered.</p>
<p>(12) Industrialists returning from the rear should be given priority in allocating factories.</p>
<p>(13) The requests from various cotton textile industries and cotton yarn and cotton cloth business associations to return the enemy and puppet-confiscated yarn and cloth, and the request from retail stores to return the retained goods will be considered.</p>
<p>(14) Deep concern is expressed regarding the disposal of enemy and puppet property.</p>
<p>(15) Importance should be attached to factory management rights, and labor-management coordination should continue to be promoted. Unreasonable demands for wage increases by workers are unacceptable.</p>
<h3>President Song Hopes the Securities Exchange Will Open Early Next Month; Summons All Members of Preparatory Committee Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The Shanghai Securities Exchange Preparatory Committee convened its ninth plenary preparatory committee meeting at the Securities Exchange Conference Room at 3:00 PM yesterday to continue reviewing applications from brokers. As of yesterday, two-thirds of the applications had been reviewed. The remaining hundred or so will be reviewed at another meeting this afternoon, with the hope of completing the work.</p>
<p>Another report: President Song specially summoned all members of the Shanghai Securities Exchange Preparatory Committee at 11:30 AM yesterday morning on the second floor of the Bank of China. President Song expressed great concern about the preparations for the Securities Exchange and hoped that it would open as soon as possible, preferably by the 9th of next month. It is reported that after receiving the instructions, the preparatory committee members will work diligently to complete various preparatory tasks so that the opening can be achieved on schedule.</p>
<h3>Unified Bonds, Red Tickets Increased, Both A and B Declined Weakly</h3>
<p>Government bonds continued to be handled according to the old plan as the Ministry of Finance held a lottery for redemption of principal. Influenced by the political situation, they inevitably trended downwards. Speculation was slightly high. Unified C was relatively stable, hovering around 640 yuan after opening at 620 yuan. As a result, it fell by 20 yuan compared to last Saturday. A and B saw an increase in red tickets and fell by 40 yuan. Unified D was relatively stable, and Unified E also fell slightly by 20 yuan.</p>
<h3>Pessimistic Outlook for Industry and Commerce; Stock Market Slump</h3>
<p>The Shanghai stock market became more pessimistic yesterday due to the deteriorating political situation and the outlook for industry and commerce, causing widespread anxiety. Selling increased slightly. Although the market was relatively stable at the opening, it was difficult to sustain. The morning's high prices were 708 yuan for Yongsheng Yarn, 4,050 yuan for Mei Ya, 228 yuan for Jingfu, 225 yuan for Xinguang, and 168 yuan for Qinxing. Afterwards, prices gradually fell, and sentiment deteriorated, making it impossible to rally. Although there were many struggles in the middle, the market plunged to low prices near noon. Yongsheng Yarn saw 665 yuan, Mei Ya 3,730 yuan, Jingfu 203 yuan, Xinguang 202 yuan, and Qinxing 155 yuan. Afterwards, there was a slight consolidation. Small and medium-sized unpopular stocks and veteran stocks were difficult to recover and remained slightly lower. As a result, compared to last Saturday, Yongsheng Yarn fell by 19 yuan, Mei Ya fell slightly by 20 yuan, and the three small popular stocks such as Jingfu also fell by 5 yuan to 8 yuan. Although the decline of small and medium-sized unpopular stocks was not large, veteran stocks were relatively stable.</p>
<p>Foreign stocks remained sluggish yesterday. There was no transaction at first. Later, with sporadic floating orders, people were eager to sell. Yisha was opened at 7,700 to 7,800 yuan. Others followed suit and had more transactions. The rise and fall of each stock varied depending on the supply and demand situation. As a result, Yiguang Yisha and Jardine Matheson each fell by half a percent or so. Yibiao, British United, and Asia fell slightly, while steel and paper were flat.</p>
<h3>Coal Market Transactions Sparse</h3>
<p>The white coal trend in the coal market was hovering. Local actual sales remained normal. Goods arrived continuously, and although the quantity was scattered, it was sufficient for the needs of the city. Therefore, there was guaranteed supply for every demand in the market, and prices were quite (blank). The bituminous coal process was extremely calm, and transactions were also quite (blank). There was a lack of buyers for the coal allocated by the Coal Merchants Joint Office, so the market price and the allocation price have already (blank). The arrival of local charcoal was abundant, and the market continued to fall.</p>
<h3>Yarn Prices Rise Universally</h3>
<p>The yarn market was even stronger yesterday. Prices of 20-count yarns of all grades rose by 20,000 to 30,000, and prices of 42-count yarns rose by as much as 50,000 to 60,000. Among the guest traders, the destocking in Guangdong and southern China was not high, and there was no movement in Beijing and the interior. However, the northern traders favored the 20-count Red Kui Star, absorbing a lot of it. Sentiment was therefore strengthened. As usual, Fangjian opened its yarn sales at noon, with (blank) of 20-count and Shuangshe of 42-count available for sale, which was (blank). Because the market in Tianjin was thriving, sentiment was raised, and the exhausted and sluggish (blank) was also inspired. However, there were small orders from the north, Guangdong, Fujian, and other places, so the market turned for the better, resulting in an increase of 500 yuan to 1,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Restructuring of Yokohama Specie Bank</h3>
<p>[United Press Tokyo 11th] According to today's news from the Kyodo News Agency, the Yokohama Specie Bank will be completely restructured. Before the war, the bank had branches in various countries. It is reported that the bank's capital will reach 50,000,000 yen (approximately 3,333,333 US dollars).</p>
<h3>Strong Buying Interest in British and Indian Teas; Peak Prices Emerge in Hangzhou Tea Market</h3>
<p>In the tea market, the destocking of shops and guest traders in this street remains incessant, so transactions are both active and comfortable, and the market is exceptionally strong. As for the foreign tea market, the buying interest of British and Indian tea merchants is growing, with steady transactions of Tanyang black tea, Fujian small kind, old Qimen, and old Chouzhen. As the market inventory of old Zhongchouzhen is relatively low, the sellers are trying to raise prices, and the market is soaring. As a result, prices rose rapidly to 56,000 yuan per dan until the close, and the prices remained solid. According to people in the industry, prices in the Hangzhou tea market are rising sharply, and it is not easy to smoothly collect old Qimen tea even at a price of 130,000 yuan per dan. The reason for this is that the two British companies, Xiehe and Jardine Matheson, have been collecting tea in that area since last week, and sentiment is getting better and better. Judging from the current situation, the future seems to continue to rise.</p>
<h3>High Quality Japonica is Strong</h3>
<p>Yesterday, 5,000 to 6,000 shi of rice arrived from both the north and the south. The sales in stores were moving but not strong. High quality rice remains strong, while medium quality rice seems to be less energetic. Lower grade indica rice also tends to be soft. However, as the stock of Baiyuan rice is low, prices have risen by 2,000 to 3,000 yuan. After several days of decline, the price of flour has become short. Stores took advantage of the opportunity to purchase it, so sales became active and prices rose by 200 to 300 yuan. The north is still sourcing white wheat, while Fujian, Shantou, and Xiamen are selecting and purchasing high quality wheat. New soybeans are scarce and have rebounded by 500 to 600 yuan. Stores are selling vegetable oil in small quantities, and the factory is supplying some soybean and rapeseed oil. The market is strong by 1,000 yuan. Bran from Changzhou and Wuxi is stable.</p>
<h3>Artificial Silk Rises by 100,000; Silk Goods Still Show No Improvement</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the silk market followed the rise in gold prices. Artificial silk No. 120 "Tianqiao Youguang" opened at 1.66 million yuan, later reaching 1.7 million yuan before closing. In the afternoon, market sentiment was even more buoyant, with demand exceeding supply, and 1.73 million yuan still couldn't secure a purchase. This represents a substantial increase of 100,000 yuan compared to the end of last week. "Zapai" (mixed brand) No. 120 "Youguang" also followed suit, rising by approximately 100,000 yuan. No. 75 "Jinji Banguang" (Golden Rooster Semi-gloss), due to its scarcity, became even more expensive, with offers of 1.72 million yuan still failing to secure supply. No. 120 "Banguang" (Semi-gloss) was less impressive, increasing by 40,000 to 50,000 yuan compared to last Saturday. No. 150 "Youguang" increased by 70,000 to 80,000 yuan. Although factory silk trading houses showed some willingness to accept offers, holders of goods were still waiting and unwilling to sell cheaply, resulting in no transactions. User silk, ordinary goods, 74.5% to 5 "dan" heads, traded between 1.95 million and 2 million yuan, with another "dan" trading at approximately 1.85 million to 1.9 million yuan, an increase of 70,000 to 80,000 yuan compared to last weekend. "Gan Jing" (dried warp) was ignored, with asking prices for available goods at around 1.35 million yuan per "dan." Sales of silk goods have not shown any improvement, so even though raw materials are expensive, the selling price of finished products is still difficult to increase accordingly. "Hua Jin Chou" (Chinese brocade crepe) traded at 2,100 yuan yesterday, only 30 to 40 yuan higher than last Saturday.</p>
<h3>New Pharmaceutical Industry Requests Restoration of Bayer Drug Allocation</h3>
<p>Since the Enemy Property Administration switched to a bidding method for various Bayer pharmaceutical products, various parties have been vying to purchase them, driving up prices. Pharmacies in other areas all felt a sense of regret at being unable to acquire them. Shi Zhifu, chairman of the New Pharmaceutical Industry Association, specifically telegraphed the administration, requesting the restoration of allocation. An excerpt of the original text is as follows: The various batches of stored drugs from Bayer and Schering, from January to June of this year, were gradually allocated to pharmacies in the city at a fair price by the Bayer Plant Liquidation Office, allowing the market price to remain stable. Since July, a bidding method has been adopted. The purpose of the bidding method is to obtain high prices, but bidders only value high prices, and buyers are bound to pay high prices, which will inevitably lead to rising prices, which is undeniable. Our association sincerely requests that your administration immediately cancel the bidding method and restore the previous practice of fair-price allocation. If it is said that the quantity of each type of drug varies and cannot be allocated in groups, our association specifically offers the following remedial measures: 1. For those with sufficient quantities, allocate according to the original number of groups. 2. For those with scarce quantities, allocate according to the existing number of groups, or select other drugs with similar sales and equal prices to supplement the insufficient groups. If there are concerns about unfairness, a lottery can be used to determine the allocation. Whether this is appropriate, we respectfully request your consideration.</p>

<h3>The Situation Stimulates People's Hearts; Gold Market Buying Spree Erupts; US Dollar Also Rises by 115 Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday, due to reports that Marshall's mediation had failed and that Chairman Chiang was scheduled to deliver a speech on the 14th, people's hearts were stirred up and a buying spree erupted. The market opened at 1.935 million yuan, and demand exceeded supply for a time, gradually rising to 2.01 million yuan. As pressure gradually increased, some people also closed out positions at high prices, causing a slight decline. After 10:00 AM, the Central Bank allocated 115 taels at a price of 1.98 million yuan. After that, it once fell back to 1.97 million yuan, but because people's hearts were still firm, there were many supporters after the low, and at noon, it still approached the 2 million yuan mark. In the afternoon, there was continued progress, ending at a high price of 2.02 million yuan. As a result, it rose by 94,000 yuan compared to last Saturday. Jewelry was priced at 2.115 million yuan.

<h3>US Newspapers Debate Troop Withdrawal Issue; Majority Support Continued Presence in China</h3>
<p>[Special Correspondent of this Newspaper, Washington, 11th] The New York World-Telegram, one of the major newspapers in the Scripps-Howard chain, recently published an article opposing the withdrawal of US troops from China. The gist of the article is: the demand for the withdrawal of US troops is a comprehensive propaganda offensive by the CCP, attempting to influence the US government and people. In reality, their hope is to replace them with Soviet troops, Soviet military advisors, and delegations. The newspaper also speculates that even if Chairman Chiang invites the CCP to participate in the central government, the CCP will still not abandon its strategy of creating a civil war in the future, because although the Soviet Union has repeatedly stated that it does not support the implementation of communism internationally and hopes that China will become a strong and democratic country, the ultimate goal of the CCP is still to gradually make the entire China red. At the same time, the Daily Worker, another extreme representing the Communist Party of America, criticized President Truman's China policy in an editorial, strongly urging the withdrawal of US troops from China, even saying that the civil war in China would cause a third world war, hoping to create alarm.</p>
<p>[US Information Service, Washington, 11th] The Dallas News discussed the role of the United States on the Chinese stage, stating: "Although our mediation policy has not made much progress so far, it may continue. However, we must pay attention to avoiding military assistance to one or both sides to avoid prolonging the conflict that we are trying to prevent. A peaceful and rebuilt China is a potential for world stability and is especially valuable to us because it can serve as a strong and friendly country on the other side of our Pacific." The Washington Star reviewed the reasons for the US military's presence in China and stated: If the US military withdraws, the CCP will take the opportunity to enter and replace it, and "become another stimulus to internal strife." The Star concluded: "These issues must be considered when dealing with our plans for the military."</p>
<p>Radio commentator Shi Zhou broadcasted:</p>
<p>"The US military will never withdraw from China until the Marine Corps being bound and attacked has not been fully and satisfactorily resolved." Shi Wen continued, "The Communist Party delays the investigation of this incident, and at the same time fabricates rumors accusing the Marine Corps of fighting alongside the National Army against them. This kind of fabricated news is the routine procedure of the two sides of the Chinese struggle. In fact, the Marine Corps has never fought alongside the National Army. Chinese people value face more than people in other countries, they all know that if we withdraw our armed forces because of being struck, it will be a great loss of face for us. It is difficult to understand why the Communist Party adopted violent means to force us to withdraw from China. They may think that doing so will make American public opinion demand the withdrawal of troops stationed abroad in order to live for a foreign government, but the Communist Party misjudged the country’s reaction, because our Marine Corps will never withdraw due to danger, and most Americans do not agree to station troops. The United States' policy was originally to withdraw troops stationed in China within this year. The Communist Party's ambush of the Marine Corps may have delayed the withdrawal of US troops, but in any case, it will not accelerate their withdrawal."</p>
<p>An editorial in the New York Herald Tribune stated: "Regardless of the dangers of the US Marine Corps stationed in North China, in today's situation, ordering them to withdraw would be a mistake." The condemnation of the recall of the Marine Corps propaganda here is issued to the following types of people: (1) A small but very influential group of free people; (2) Not only the Communist Party of China, but also the Communist Parties of the Soviet Union and the United States. Because the communists see the US Marine Corps stationed in China as a major obstacle to the conspiracy of the CCP to rule more land, if the Marine Corps withdraws from China today, the result will be to make China's politics. Military, economic and other aspects are in chaos, transportation lines will also be cut off, and most of China's industrial production, which is urgently needed to restore eight years of war, will also stop immediately. If the Marine Corps withdraws from China, it will make the Soviet Union believe that the United States no longer pays attention to building a strong and independent China, but this is precisely the main reason why we engaged in the Pacific War. The Soviet Union, which desperately wants to fill the power gap in its border forces, will make China another Poland. The United States does not allow Japan to carve up China with a population of 450 million, nor should it allow other countries to rule it. Therefore, the presence of the Marine Corps in China is necessary at present. The most sound approach is to strive to create a "coalition government" so that free people can grasp the balanced power. This kind of government can make China survive independently, outside the power of the Soviet Union, the United States and other countries.</p>
<h3>Memories of the Battle of Shanghai</h3>
<p>— Yang Hu</p>
<p>Today, ten years ago, under the wise decision-making of the supreme leader, our Chinese nation unveiled the prelude to the unprecedented all-out anti-Japanese sacred war in the Shanghai area - the "Battle of Shanghai." Although the duration of this prelude was only more than eighty days, it laid a valuable foundation for the final victory. In this battle alone, the patriotism and spirit of sacrifice shown by our nation gave the enemy a severe blow to their contemptuous view of our nation's traditions and inspired the strong consciousness of the country's long-term resistance, winning the attention of international friendly countries. Therefore, the Battle of Shanghai is the most glorious chapter in the history of the Chinese nation's rejuvenation.</p>
<p>On the day the sacred war broke out, I happened to be serving again in the Shanghai Garrison Command and was ordered to concurrently take charge of the Shanghai Garrison. The former's main task was to assist the front-line military, while the latter's was to ensure local security. The two complement each other and cannot be overemphasized. Therefore, the principle I followed in performing my duties at that time was to assist the military and civilians in strengthening the anti-war forces. The military was the center of everything, while political, social, diplomatic, propaganda, and fortification matters, as well as supply, rescue, refugee accommodation, material preservation, and traffic transportation, must also advance in unison in order to achieve the full-scale combat of the military and civilians. However, I felt that my talent was thin and my duties were heavy, so I was deeply fearful and knew the heavy responsibility of revolutionary soldiers and revolutionary party members to the country, and I dared not have any intention of fear. On the eve of the outbreak of the war, Yang Zeng was summoned to Beijing, and after being personally instructed by the supreme commander, I felt an even greater responsibility and increased my determination to serve the country and the party.</p>
<p>Before our army reached the planned front-line position, the task assigned to me was to command the local military police to ensure the forward position and wait for the arrival of the large army in the rear and enter the planned front-line position. This forward mission made me deeply vigilant, for fear that it would not be easy to complete, which would lead to a major military opportunity. There were several points: First, the number of local military police troops, the quality and equipment were far inferior to the enemy's, and most of them had no combat experience. Second, the forward mission was to ensure the position in terms of strategic tactics, and it was not allowed to start a war first. Third, the enemy was in an active position, and I had to avoid starting a war first. The enemy and my areas were closely intertwined. I not only had to occupy the forward position in a timely manner, but also had to cover the large army that arrived after entering the front-line position without being detected by the enemy. Based on the above reasons, the execution of the forward mission at that time was extremely difficult, but it finally completed the mission smoothly, making the planned strategic and tactical actions gradually unfold favorably. In fact, it relied on the supreme commander's moral power and the command of commanders at all levels, and the lower ranks were united with the military and civilians, and the enemy was filled with the same hatred. After the official start of the war, my forward mission became a side and rear warning. The above-mentioned comprehensive mission with the military as the center began because the war of the 20th century was a total war and a comprehensive war, so in the execution of the comprehensive mission, a wealth of local manpower and material resources were used to assist the progress of the war zone. At the beginning, under the principle of the Three People's Principles, the use of national diplomacy benefited our entire strategy and tactics. At that time, there were insightful people who felt the inevitable coming of the Second International War and deeply knew that it was beneficial to me. Today, the enemy's defeat and victory will undoubtedly belong to me. It is the supreme leader's divine wisdom to exert national power and use diplomacy to obtain this final victory and win eternal glory for the nation.</p>
<p>Today, looking back, the smooth unfolding of the Battle of Shanghai at that time cannot but thank the local leaders, all the people, the military police compatriots, and the allied friends for the great assistance they gave in the battle, so that I have always been safe under the heavy burden. However, I think that the sacrifices of the soldiers and the suffering of the people in the eight-year war are immeasurable. The fruits of victory exchanged for such a huge price are becoming more and more difficult to build the country. Natural disasters and man-made disasters are said to be painful. The great cause of national construction is obstructed. Our national military and civilians must once again give full play to the patriotic spirit of the Battle of Shanghai. Under the leadership of the supreme leader Chairman Chiang, we must step up our efforts to complete the great cause of national construction. Although I am old and retired, I am willing to follow the national military and civilians to collect my last patriotic spirit.</p>

<h3>Regarding the Robbery of Ships</h3>
<p>Editor: I read in yesterday's newspaper about the robbery of the Shanghai-Tongban Hangli ship during its voyage. The losses to passengers were not small, and the pirates sailed away in a sailboat afterward. I think, after the loss of the ship, was the machine broken by the pirates? According to the report, it can still be driven afterward, then I think that when the pirates were boarding the sailboat to escape, just when they were leaving the ship, they could use a tie ship to slam into the wooden sailboat, causing them to capsize into the sea, and after the weapons fell into the sea, they were useless, then save them out and detain them to the water patrol team to deal with them. This method is risky, but in this way, the pirates will be caught off guard and eventually fall into the net. This is just a childish idea. The fundamental solution is that the authorities should strictly prevent such things from happening again, so that merchants and passengers will be safe and sound. (Wang Jingzhong)</p>
<h3>This Day – Commemorating "August 13th"</h3>
<p>After the Zhagou Bridge incident, although everyone felt that a storm was coming, no one dared to say when it would expand into a nationwide war. Shanghai was already extremely tense because of the successive killings of Japanese such as Zhongshan Xiuxiong and Xiongsheng. When the Hongqiao Airport incident occurred on the afternoon of August 9, all the citizens of Shanghai had a premonition that "this day" would definitely come immediately.</p>
<p>When Mayor Yu Hongjun and Japanese Consul General Okamoto and naval commander Honda negotiated, many angry citizens felt that this negotiation was superfluous. We have retreated for so many years, do we still have to endure it! In the end, Mayor Yu resolutely rejected the Japanese request. The atmosphere became more and more tense, but there was no fear. On the contrary, everyone was looking forward to it with a burning heart - welcoming "this day"!</p>
<p>On August 12, Mayor Yu attended a joint meeting of consuls from various countries and formally declared to the world that he refused the ridiculous demand to withdraw Chinese troops from Chinese territory.</p>
<p>Iron gates and sandbags were piled up around the concession. British troops, French troops, police... were densely deployed behind the gates. People walking on the road seemed to quicken their pace.</p>
<p>Occasionally, the sound of a train blowing its whistle came with the evening breeze, and every Shanghai citizen felt another surge of excitement. Because everyone knew that in these carriages were countless heroic warriors, pouring into Shanghai. The anger that had been in my heart since the Sino-Japanese War was finally about to erupt!</p>
<p>Night fell on Shanghai, and the anger of the Huangpu River was boiling.</p>
<p>There was silence on both sides of the barbed wire fence, but the soldiers behind the barbed wire were stepping up their vigilance. The starlight was faintly projected on the hat badge of the Blue Sky and White Sun, and the hands holding the rifle were slightly sweating. This time, the blood debt of the September 18th Incident and the January 28th Incident can be settled.</p>
<p>Minute by minute, second by second, passed quietly. It was twelve o'clock, and there was nothing unusual.</p>
<p>Minute by minute, second by second, August 12 passed quietly, followed by August 13, 1937.</p>
<p>"Dao Yitian" has finally arrived! (Pingzhai)</p>

<h3>Answering Readers – Medicine and Health</h3>
<p>(1) Jing Yuan asked Yu, who works in a certain company, while colleague A suffers from syphilis. It is said that his body is covered with sores, but they are covered by clothing and not easily discovered. Also, colleague B has scabies on his hands, which is said to have been transmitted by colleague A. After Yu heard this rumor, he was very panicked. He urgently wants to understand the transmission routes of syphilis and the re-transmission of scabies. However, there are many rumors. Some say that items that have been sat on or used by the patient and are still warm are easily transmitted; some say that it can be transmitted through diet; and some books say that syphilis bacteria can survive and be transmitted in water... all kinds of statements, making it even more difficult to know where to start. Therefore, I am writing to you, sir. I respectfully await your guidance.</p>
<p>[Dr. Zhang Zhongming replied] Skin diseases such as syphilis and scabies are transmitted through direct contact, but cannot be transmitted through diet. (2) He Jingru asked (1) Every other day, there is an unusual odor coming from both armpits. Is this what is commonly called fox odor? What is the cause? (2) Is there a personal way to treat it? (3) It is said that it can be treated with electrotherapy. Is this true? Can electrotherapy be used to treat this disease in various hospitals in Shanghai?</p>
<p>[Dr. Zhang Zhongming replied] (1) This is fox odor, which is caused by excessive development of sweat glands in both armpits. (2) The personal treatment method is to use talcum powder to keep the sweat dry. (3) The root treatment method is to remove the sweat glands in both armpits. Electrotherapy can also be used. (3) Wu Muping asked about a relative, Mr. So-and-so, 22 years old, unmarried. He suffered from joint pain two years ago, with a limp in his right foot and weakness in his right hand. His thighs and arms were thin. A Chinese medicine doctor diagnosed it as rheumatism, and taking supplements was effective. The following year, it relapsed, with symptoms as before. He was cured by a Western doctor, and the year after that, it relapsed as usual, and he also had back pain from time to time. It has been better and worse since then. In the 32nd year of the Republic of China, he had already studied [unclear] and in August, [unclear] could not [unclear]. Doctors mostly diagnosed it as bone shifting and said that there was no specific medicine. He had to use a plaster bed for treatment, but he was not sure, so he did not do it. Please ask (1) What is this actually a disease? (2) Is there any way to treat it?</p>
<p>[Dr. Zhang Shenming replied] This disease seems to be chronic rheumatism. Try using sodium salicylate [unclear], which may be effective.</p>
<h3>Xie Zhongshi's Rickshaw Puller</h3>
<p>Two Boxes of Glass Returned to Their Original Owner</p>
<p>Editor: On the morning of August 7, Mr. Xu, an employee of our shop, went to Fujian Road to purchase two boxes of glass, which were placed on a tricycle and returned to the shop. When the car reached a crowded place in the middle of the road, it was blocked from the car by two or three feet of sight. When it was able to pass through, the car had already been lost. It was considered to have escaped [unclear]. Liu Dian reported to the shop, which was very disappointing. But at 3:00 p.m., the respectable rickshaw puller delivered the goods to our shop. He said that he had also been looking for a long time and had asked the wholesaler for our shop's name and detailed address, and had found it. When I gave him a considerable reward, I thought that the rickshaw puller had this kind of righteousness, which is really admirable and is worthy of being considered old-fashioned. I am a reader who is not good at writing. I was moved by the honest Sishuchefu, and I submitted a manuscript to you, which is not up to my ability. For the honest, it is appropriate to improve the social atmosphere. I would like to wish you peace. Sincerely yours, Qu Sizheng, 35 An'nan Road, Ruikang Hardware Store, August 8.</p>

<h3>If Your Child Throws a Tantrum</h3>
<p>— Yu Renfeng</p>
<p>Children are important members of a family, sufficient to enhance the affection and love between husband and wife; however, if there is a child who is both annoying and prone to tantrums, it will instead cause disputes between husband and wife.</p>
<p>However, a child's proneness to tantrums is not innate; some are caused by various environmental factors, for which parents bear a great responsibility. Parents should constantly observe them, find the reasons why they throw tantrums, and then apply fundamental solutions.</p>
<p>(1) Keep children constantly busy, and they will not have time to throw tantrums. Therefore, it is best to give children toys that involve creativity to play with. On the one hand, it can promote the child's creative spirit; on the other hand, it can give them the pleasure of completing something difficult. Wouldn't that be killing several birds with one stone? However, it is also important to note whether the toy is too difficult. If it is too difficult, the child will overexert their brainpower and damage their health, and failure will cause them frustration and fear of trying?</p>
<p>(2) Treat children like adults. We often assume that we don't need to respect children, and we can casually take away the things they are playing with. However, children also have their rights and desires. How can we take away something they are enjoying so much? No wonder they will resist and get angry. Even if they are playing with something unreasonable, don't snatch it away from their hands immediately. Always treat the child with kind words!</p>
<p>(3) Be consistent in how you treat your child. Once, I saw a child running around wearing his father's shoes. I found it very funny, and his mother also laughed heartily. A few days later, he wore his father's new shoes again and started running and jumping. His mother, fearing that he would ruin the shoes, shouted and snatched the shoes away, and the child started crying. Why is it that doing the same thing is welcomed the first time but prohibited the second time? No wonder the child will be confused and throw a tantrum. We must pay attention to this point. When a child does something unreasonable and funny, we should give a warning the first time, not laugh at him the first time and scold him the second time. Even if what he does is extremely funny, we should laugh first and then give a lesson, telling him not to do it again next time, or he will be punished. Then, when he does it the second time, even if he is scolded, he will feel it is deserved and will not throw a tantrum out of confusion.</p>
<p>(4) Children will naturally seek to extremely satisfy their desires. If they are not given guidance, they will continue to do so. Therefore, as parents, when a child does something too much, you should immediately show an unpleasant expression, making him understand that what he is doing is not liked by his parents. At the same time, explain the wrongness of this matter to him, so that when he commits it again next time, even if he is scolded, he will not be surprised and throw a tantrum.</p>
<p>(5) Pay attention to the child's psychological state. When children are too tired, hungry, or overstimulated, they are prone to anger and do things that they would not do even in a rage under normal circumstances. When they are in such an environment, parents should not blame them. They should try their best to find the reasons why they are angry and remove them (such as giving them food when they are hungry and clothes when they are cold), or give them a reasonable amount of rest. When they return to a normal and calm state, then use guidance to tell them what they did wrong.</p>
<p>(6) Children are naturally active, curious, and careless. However, many people cannot tolerate these characteristics of theirs. Children are just children. How can they distinguish between what is good and what is bad like adults? For example, if a child puts on a new piece of clothing, he might sit on the ground to play or eat fruit, making the new piece of clothing very dirty, and when he is scolded, he will throw a tantrum. The reason why the child made the clothes dirty is because the child does not know that making the clothes dirty is a bad behavior. As parents, you should use observation and teaching to deal with and enlighten their ignorance, and not always give unreasonable beatings.</p>
<p>(7) Children are most attentive to their surrounding environment. People who are easily angered can affect children, also making them easily angered. Next door to me, there is a family with only a mother and son. That mother scolds her son every day, so her son has also become naughty and easily angered.</p>
<p>(8) When a child is angry, do not give him what he wants. Many parents, in order to stop a child from throwing a tantrum, exhaust every means to satisfy the child's abnormal demands. In this way, although the child's anger stops, he will imitate this method whenever he wants something in the future. Wouldn't that become a habit! Many children's habits of throwing tantrums are formed in this way.</p>
<p>(9) When a child is angry, he likes to attract people's attention. Sometimes, his anger is just to elicit a reaction from adults, to let adults know that he is angry; perhaps he wants to test the extent of adults' reaction to his tantrums and get comfort. However, many adults fall for it. If they are strict, they will give him a heavy warning. Although he may sometimes be subdued as a result, it only increases his desire to test and have a second try. Sometimes, if he is not subdued, he will instead become even angrier. Weak parents will use things to stop his anger, which is even worse. The child thinks that throwing a tantrum will get him something unexpected, so how can he not frequently get angry? Therefore, as parents, when you feel that a child is angry for this reason, you should not only ignore him, but also tell him that this kind of behavior will not get him any results. He can try his best to throw a tantrum, letting him learn a lesson—that throwing a tantrum is useless—and he won't throw one casually next time!</p>
<p>The above methods for dealing with children's tantrums can only be achieved by parents with absolute determination. Many children throw tantrums for a long time, and the parents are afraid that the child will get too upset, so they deliberately break the rules and bribe them with things. This cultivates the child's bad habits. Some parents can make up their minds, but they give in to the child because of the grandparents. But, parents, ultimately, your child's future is important!</p>

<h3>Cooking: Iced Lian</h3>
<p>— Zou Shangchang</p>
<p>During this hot summer, housewives often take their children to ice shops to eat iced lian, which is both costly and time-consuming, and even more inconvenient if there are many children. Now, I will introduce a way to make your own iced lian that saves money and time. If four or five people are eating, a small bucket is enough. We often see stalls selling egg roll iced lian on the side of the road; they use this kind of bucket to shake it out.</p>
<p>The ingredients are six eggs, one can of evaporated milk, a small bottle of flavoring, an appropriate amount of sugar, fifteen pounds of ice, and a small amount of salt.</p>
<p>First, break the eggs, separate the egg whites and yolks, and beat them into a foam. Then, add the evaporated milk, sugar, and flavoring, and mix well. If you like it sweet, add more sugar. Then, pour it into the iron bucket for shaking iced lian, and add cold water until it is one inch from being full (because it will become loose after shaking and fill the entire bucket). Place it in a wooden bucket, add ice outside, and put a little salt on top to lower its temperature. Once everything is ready, you can start shaking it. It takes about a quarter of an hour to take it out and eat, and the taste is extremely delicious, no less than what you buy. If your family has skim milk powder brought back from school by younger siblings, then you can use it. Take a teacup of milk powder, mix it with water, making sure there are no lumps, and then mix it with the eggs, evaporated milk, sugar, etc., and the taste will be even richer.</p>
<p>The total cost is less than half of what it would cost for four or five people to eat in a store, and the quantity is more than twice as much as in a store. It can truly be called inexpensive and of high quality. Wise housewives, instead of running to the store in the hot weather, why not make a bucket yourself?</p>
<h3>A Tip for Household Matters</h3>
<p>— Li Ying</p>
<p>Recently, the weather has been extremely hot, and various insects and poisonous creatures often appear. The other day, I happened to visit a friend's house and saw that a centipede had been found inside the mosquito net. They were at a loss, and ended up clamping the centipede outside the net, tearing a large hole in it to take it down, which was extremely foolish.</p>
<p>If a poisonous creature is found inside the net, and it is inconvenient to take the net down, you can hold a basin filled with water up with your hand, placing it below the poisonous creature. Another person outside the net can strike the net with an object, causing the creature to fall into the basin. The creature cannot crawl out of the water in the basin. However, you must be agile to avoid it escaping and causing complications.</p>
<h3>On Adornment</h3>
<p>— Mu Mei</p>
<p>Love of beauty is human nature. Within appropriate limits, I am not against ordinary people's adornment. Often, some people use "applying rouge and powder" to ridicule women. The old saying "women adorn themselves for those who appreciate them" has some slighting implications for women. In fact, I think that rather than being unkempt and disheveled, giving people an unpleasant feeling, it is better to lightly and appropriately adorn your hair, face, and clothes to give people a clean and beautiful impression. As for many women who specialize in heavy makeup and bizarre clothing to win the jealousy of other women and the favors of men, that is quite unnecessary.</p>
<p>The most important condition for adornment is to be suitable for your identity and pay attention to your age. Is it appropriate for a fifteen- or sixteen-year-old middle school student to hold books in her hand and wear high heels? Is it appropriate for a fifty- or sixty-year-old grandmother to perm her hair and apply lipstick? Those who are good at adornment will definitely match their hair, clothing, shoes, and socks to their identity and age. Then, when you are in public, you will definitely be able to give people a good impression that is appropriate, and you will never be given stares or whispered comments!</p>
<p>However, the general women of Shanghai are too fond of following trends blindly. As long as a cheongsam has a style that is popular outside, they will follow suit regardless of everything. At one time, a striped pattern was popular for clothing. It certainly flattered a slender figure, but the average short and plump woman also imitated it. After wearing it, the pattern of the clothing itself was certainly fashionable, but when worn on a short and plump body, it only made the person appear shorter and fatter, and almost swollen, with no sense of beauty at all! In recent years, many fashionable women like to wear leather shoes barefoot. A pair of tender, lotus root-like feet without scars, plus a pair of snow-white leather shoes, certainly feels clean and simple. However, not every woman's feet are exactly the same. Once, on the road, I saw an old woman who was nearly fifty years old, with her hair permed into waves, the sleeves of her cheongsam cut short to the shoulders, and a long-strapped leather bag hanging on her shoulder. Her face was painted red and white, but it could not hide the traces of wrinkles. When I lowered my head to look, it was even more unbearable. She was actually wearing a pair of white deerskin hollow shoes barefoot. The unnatural state of walking with a twist and pinch, heaven knows, this was clearly a pair of feet that had been rebuilt! What was the point of that? She felt uncomfortable herself and there was no beauty to speak of, and she was even ridiculed and talked about behind her back. Such blind imitation of adornment is truly wanting to increase its beauty but only adding to its ugliness!</p>
<p>Love of beauty is not a disgrace for women, but what should be paid attention to is not to blindly follow fashion and forget one's own identity and age.</p>

<h3>On the Issue of Popularizing Art</h3>
<p>— Shi Liangfu</p>
<p>The issue of "popularizing art" was hotly debated during the war. Proponents of "popularization" constantly emphasized that "art should be for the masses," "art cannot be isolated from the masses," and "works that are not accepted by the masses will lose their value." These statements cannot be denied by us. However, in fact, up to now, this issue is still an issue. Artists say so, write so, but are their works all liked by the masses? I dare say that the more accomplished the writer, the more impassable this road is at present! Take woodcut art as an example. From the beginning, it touted realism and claimed to be popular art. In the free areas during the war, due to the difficulty of etching metal plates, it also gained some appreciation from people. However, are those who appreciate woodcuts some of the toiling masses of the lower and middle classes? This is a big question mark. I remember that we held several national woodcut exhibitions in Anhui Province, and the audience cannot be said to be small! The strangest thing is that there were no farmers (or businessmen) among the audience. Even if there were one or two who joined in the fun, they were not as interested as when they watched calendar posters and Fu Qi's comic books. Is it that the content and form of the works are not good enough? No! Almost nine out of ten of the works we exhibited were the writer's proud masterpieces, and they had been selected several times before the exhibition, so they cannot be said to be substandard. Why does this phenomenon occur? This shows that, apart from catering to the masses, advocating the popularization of art in the current stage of Chinese society is a dead end, because the deeper the mastery of the work, the more incomprehensible it is to those with insufficient knowledge! Then, is a writer willing to have his skills and content not seek further progress, but just stop at the stage of catering to the vulgar tastes of the masses and be satisfied? I think that apart from its performance techniques having no way to improve and other intentions, this will absolutely not happen. These words, I think, do not negate the truth that art should be popularized. The real way to popularize art is not to lower its value to cater to the masses, but to first improve the masses' ability to appreciate it, which is a legitimate path.</p>
<p>Therefore, we come to a conclusion: if the living standards of the masses are not improved, then they will not be able to enjoy higher education. The lower the level of education, the lower the ability to appreciate. Therefore, the focus of the problem is still on the two words "people's livelihood." It is useless to just shout for the popularization of art.</p>
<h3>Bumping</h3>
<p>— Zhang Baihuai</p>
<p>We are about to leave a place that will be so deeply etched in our memories in the future, under the old, lush trees. Enthusiastic hands are waving, a deep and earnest farewell song is being sung, and the small triangular red flag inserted on the front of the car begins to flutter in the bright sunlight. Our bodies are also vibrating slightly. The stuffy carriage is like a building with open windows, quickly flowing through a layer of mountain joy….</p>
<p>People are being carried forward to a new memory. It is said that the destination was once an extremely remote border town. Today, we imagine what kind of long street that border town has, a street that laughs out loud from lonely dreams, with groups of elementary school students chasing after the soldiers, receiving candies, biscuits, and other toys and gifts….</p>
<p>The earth has several strong jolts. This road is so hard to flatten! The vibrating sound in my ears is so loud that I feel dizzy. The comrades who are talking seem to be just those three or four. I accidentally open my eyes, which I don't know when I closed. Uh oh, one of the comrades vomited.</p>
<p>People wipe it with their hands, and some take out handkerchiefs with the name of the service team's young lady embroidered on them—or perhaps with the name of their dearest person embroidered on them.</p>
<p>"Hey, make some room!" Someone shouted at the three companions on the roof of the car.</p>
<p>"Make some room, there's no wind in here!"</p>
<p>That's a gap above the driver's seat, the only happiness of the people sitting in the carriage, their hope lies on it. Look how respectful those three comrades are of other people's opinions, they quickly lean to both sides, willing to sit in such a small position. They won't lose their balance when the car goes downhill, will they?</p>
<p>When our car stopped at a desolate small shop, the sky was covered with clouds and a drizzle fell. What a pleasant way the comrades spread out the supplies for the journey. That deserted small restaurant and tea shop had happy, light-hearted conversations and laughter. "Hey, what's wrong, can't you bear a little hardship?" Someone laughed at the vomiting weakling. They spat a mouthful of saliva, and although they were hungry, they still refused the temptation of food.</p>
<p>The wheels were turning and twisting on the mud and stones, and it was really a big road. That meant, they calculated, they could arrive at the city before dusk.</p>
<p>Anti-Japanese songs, the people in the car were all silent, overcome by fatigue and sleep, or perhaps someone was quietly thinking about something. Alas, I seemed to hear someone sigh. This car was sending him to such a remote place, and these comrades would mostly see the classmates and professors who had once encouraged them to join the war, and even their proud, sociable girlfriends, in the cities they passed through….</p>
<p>Well, they should all be thinking about how to brag about that new life, that life so tense that there was no time to write letters! Why isn't it worth bragging about? "Look," they can say righteously, "the color of my skin explains everything."</p>
<p>But how many bumps! Our car suddenly broke down! The front wheel came off the axle, and the car tilted forward for dozens of steps, leaving a deep mark on the road. The driver, sticking out his tongue, said: If it had been downhill, this would have been the end!</p>
<p>So, is there still a need to worry in vain? Our driver is a skilled technician. Without hesitation, they crawled under the car to inspect it, tapping and turning, and started to repair it.</p>
<p>On the top of the mountain peak, we saw orange-yellow rays of light, the setting sun reddening half the sky, crystal-clear evening clouds, white clouds dancing leisurely.</p>
<p>The comrades gathered together and sang.</p>
<p>In the dim light, the car now has two large eyes wide open. The driver even deliberately honked the horn, causing a ripple in the mountains. Oh, it's time to drive, people now need a grand dinner so much.</p>
<p>The night city, rested our breathing. Bed bugs and mosquitoes, sucking our tired dreams. The journey is still very far.</p>
<p>The next day, we moved the luggage to the car again. I became one of the three passengers on the green-painted roof of the car. I was taught to use a belt to strap my shoulders and knew that it wasn't dangerous. My two companions were kind, they told me that facing the wind, I wouldn't get dizzy, but when passing by the branches of trees on the side of the road, I had to be careful to lower my head, and beware of my glasses….</p>
<p>Indeed, compared to being inside, it was as different as shackles and freedom. Sitting here, what you see is the blue of the sky, the magnificence of the sun, the winding highway, and the green of the surrounding fields, the bridges, the village houses, and the terraced fields like large stone steps…. It allows people to look around and appreciate the strangeness of nature even while bumping along. My comrades and I also talked about the past and future dreams, and jointly expressed a firm belief.</p>
<p>We were always paying attention, so as not to let a comrade inside get angry because of stuffiness. We sat sideways, "Cool wind, come in!" one, we even shouted like this.</p>
<p>After passing through a city, and then another city… Although these cities are red and green, we think that one day our young new team will enter the crisscrossing paved roads, with tanks and motorcycles as the vanguard, and countless people and young women will throw flowers at us, and we will truly be proud and happy!</p>
<p>We have already traveled seven hundred kilometers. On the last day, our car climbed over a high mountain ridge, and when it was only a short distance from a border town in that basin, the overcast wind finally surged, and the car drove the last ten kilometers in the wind and rain. For the sake of a kind of heart's persistence, we didn't avoid the crowded carriage because our clothes were wet. Taking off our shoes and socks and rolling up our sleeves, we supported ourselves, smiling in the wind and rain. In the howling rain and thunder, and the splashing water under the wheels, we had a strange, tense pleasure in our hearts, as if we were engaged in a battle.</p>
<p>Seeing the newly built training field outside the suburbs, we had arrived, we cheered, and then the song followed the car into the city gate. In the dusk, when we jumped out of the car: some people were thinking: the border mountain city, what a long street, one day a great procession will wind its way from here like a dragon to the coast thousands of miles away….</p>

<h3>Laying the Foundation for True Democracy, Embarking on the Stage of Constitutional Practice, Seeking Welfare for More Than Four Million Citizens</h3>
<p>— Our Reporter, Zhang Yinhuai</p>
<p>"August 13th" is a significant turning point in Shanghai's history. Nine years ago today, the fury of resistance spread throughout Shanghai with the flames of war. Nine years later today, Shanghai's first truly representative body of public opinion is declared established.</p>
<p>The brilliant torch of constitutionalism shines the first light of dawn before the eyes of four and a half million citizens.</p>
<p>Review of Glorious Pre-War History, Regular Review of General Estimates and Budgets</p>
<p>However, it must be said that Shanghai's having representatives of public opinion did not begin today. Before the war, the city had already established a Provisional Municipal Council, with councilors such as Du Yuesheng, Wang Xiaolai, Xu Yongzuo, and Wang Boqi. Among them were the late Yu Qiaqing, Wang Yiting, Xu Xinliu, General Manager of Zhejiang Industrial Bank who was shot down by Japanese寇 in the southwestern sky, and Liu Zhanen, President of Shanghai University who was shot and killed by Japanese secret agents in Shanghai. There were also Wu Yunqi, Wen Lanting, and others who are now problematic figures. They regularly held meetings to pass the general estimate of the previous year, discuss the city's financial budget, or hold tea parties to entertain some Chinese and foreign political and diplomatic dignitaries.</p>
<p>During the eight years of bloody war, loyal and steadfast representatives of public opinion naturally withdrew with the National Army to the rear, and Shanghai became an isolated island, a demonic realm without light. Under the bayonets of the enemy, they naturally had their own system. Puppets like Xu Jianping and Jian Jianwu appeared one after another—but this did not diminish the inherent brilliance of Shanghai's municipal administration, which remained bright in the hearts of four and a half million citizens, but rather made them recognize the true nature of those puppets.</p>
<p>Mayor Wu as Chairman of the Assembly</p>
<p>Restoring the Citizens' Representation, the Provisional Council Should Be Established Soon</p>
<p>Victory purged these jumping clowns. The citizens of Shanghai wanted to restore their own representative body. Therefore, in February of the 35th year, the Municipal Government, following the orders of the Examination and Executive Yuan, actively prepared for the public office candidate vetting and then held elections for representatives of people's organizations at all levels. The entire city first conducted a census, reorganized the baojia system, and on March 28th, the Provisional Municipal Council was established.</p>
<p>The Provisional Municipal Council was a transitional body before the formal election of councilors by the citizens under objective environmental constraints. Although the councilors were appointed by the government, the selected candidates included those from the financial, industrial, commercial, news, educational, and cultural sectors, all of whom were highly respected choices of the time. The number was one hundred and fifty, with Xu Jiqing as the speaker and Xi Yushu as the vice speaker. Since the first meeting on the 30th, during the two-week session, various agencies reported daily, and there were enthusiastic inquiries from the provisional councilors. The assembly closed on April 10th and issued a declaration on the 11th.</p>
<p>After the Provisional Municipal Council adjourned, a resident committee was established. The committee was an advisor and also a supervisor of municipal administration. It had fulfilled its greatest responsibilities in areas such as epidemic prevention and security.</p>
<p>Citizens Elect Municipal Councilors, All Parties Enthusiastically Participate in the Election</p>
<p>In early April, the Municipal Government began preparing for the popular election of municipal councilors. The city was divided into 31 districts, as well as five categories: chambers of commerce, trade unions, agricultural associations, educational associations, and free professional groups, each proceeding separately. The city had more than 2.5 million voters, preparing to elect their representatives from over a thousand candidates. Many candidates also gave campaign speeches, broadcasts, or other forms of publicity in advance, and the atmosphere was unprecedentedly enthusiastic. Huang Hua and Wang Zhuyi, advisors to the Municipal Government, also specifically requested to resign from the mayor in order to participate in the election, which also shows the enthusiasm of all parties to participate in the election.</p>
<p>Citizens of Each District Vote Separately, All Municipal Councilors Elected</p>
<p>April 28th was the day of the general election. From morning to dusk, voters voted separately. Mayor Qian Qian also cast his vote at around 9:00 am. Although some minor unfortunate events occurred in the meantime, such as quarrels in the Hongqiao District, the destruction of the Jade Buddha Temple in the Putuo District, and vote rigging leading to mutual fighting in the Yulin District, the first batch of 181 municipal councilors was elected after all.</p>
<p>Among these 181 municipal councilors, Yao Mulian, the elected representative of the Penglai District, was the oldest, at 68 years old. Tian Yiting of the Yulin District and Jia Dechao of the Yangjing District were the youngest, both at 28 years old. There were only six female councilors (not including alternates). One has passed away, Weng Guang of the 12th District.</p>
<p>Now, the inaugural meeting of the Municipal Council has been set for 9:00 am today at the former German Primary School on Daxi Road, laying a new cornerstone for Shanghai's democratized municipal administration. Constitutionalism has embarked on the stage of practice. It is hoped that the 181 councilors will make good use of the power entrusted to them by the voters of Shanghai, lay a solid foundation for the constitutional movement, serve as a great model for the expression of public opinion nationwide, and seek welfare for four and a half million citizens.</p>
<p>The Municipal Council under the jurisdiction of the Yuan shall have one secretary-general; the Municipal Council under the jurisdiction of the province shall have one secretary-in-charge and one or two secretaries; and three to nine clerks, all of whom shall be selected and appointed by the speaker. If necessary, personnel may be transferred from the Municipal Government.</p>

<h3>Murmuring Thunder</h3>
<p>— Yang Lianyuan</p>
<p>In the sweltering air, rumbling sounds – is it murmuring thunder?</p>
<p>Let me tell you, two hours ago, I returned from a theater after the show ended. At that time, the sky was covered with dark clouds. I thought, how annoyed the heavens must be! But I carried back with me the unclear atmosphere from the stage, my heart filled with sighs for the joys and sorrows, the separations and reunions of those characters.</p>
<p>So, have I been infected with a slight, faint melancholy? Perhaps I have already begun to ponder something else. Alas, it's hard to say.</p>
<p>Now, I want to ask you to explore in your dust-covered memories, to trace back to thousands of years ago. Under the shade of paulownia trees, by the painted galleries, the sounds of vendors selling iced treats couldn't reach inside. At that time, the people in the house were busy with worldly affairs. Then, you, a child whose life hadn't yet blossomed, and I, a young boy. Now, let's adopt the tone of adults and say we were innocent playmates. Do you agree? Thinking back, we might both smile bashfully. Under the paulownia trees, we read together, a beautiful book filled with too many lessons: "Dream of the Red Chamber."</p>
<p>To be more precise, we were sharing the same dream.</p>
<p>It's truly a distant memory, but today's murmuring thunder has unearthed too many of my cherished recollections.</p>
<p>Today, I came back from seeing the play called "Dream of the Red Chamber," also known as "Murmuring Thunder." Therefore, I thought I should write something down, to speak! To speak of my joy, to speak of my resentment.</p>
<p>When we were young, we both shared the same dream: we had the same background, the same education. Speaking of it today, perhaps we would both smile wryly. Years have passed, seeming like lifetimes. It turned out that before our childish dreams had even awakened, we had already parted ways.</p>
<p>Why did we separate? Today, recalling it only adds to the pain. But the pain has followed me closely since watching the performance of "Dream of the Red Chamber," and it struck the chords of my sorrowful heart.</p>
<p>Bao Yu in the play said, "My voice is like murmuring thunder, unable to cry out, suppressed by thousands of years of clouds." So, have our voices also been suppressed by these years of clouds?</p>
<p>I know that in these years, you have lived a life of simple, pure sustenance. The storms outside cannot touch you. How has this life affected you? Are you clear about it now?</p>
<p>In the past few years, I had to bear the burden of the spirit given by the times, and also worry about the gradual extinguishing of the flames of my own emotions. That's how it was for me.</p>
<p>May I ask, how is it for you?</p>
<p>My voice is hoarse, but I refuse to be "resigned" to fate.</p>
<p>It's midnight now, what a poet would call a midsummer night. A cool breeze blows in through the window, driving away the summer heat, and I finally enjoy a quiet night.</p>
<p>But the murmuring thunder is still rumbling, and the sound is unsettling.</p>
<p>Tell me! How long must we endure?</p>
<h3>An Inch of Mountain, an Inch of Blood</h3>
<p>— Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>—If this romance has even a shred of value, the author reverently dedicates it to the fighters who sacrificed themselves in the eight years of war, and to their families.</p>
<p>·Prologue·</p>
<p>I apologize, but the word "prologue" is somewhat old-fashioned, pathetically so, but it's quite fitting, so I'll use it once. Please forgive me, reader—</p>
<p>In the thirty-eight thousand nine hundred and thirty-first small battle, there was such an incident. I can't remember which one it was (please note, the military has records). This war of resistance, besides the thirty-eight thousand nine hundred and thirty-one small battles, also had one thousand one hundred and seventeen important battles, and twenty-two tearful and soul-stirring rallies. Anyway, in these thirty-eight thousand and nine hundred plus small battles, there was such an incident.</p>
<p>Even though it was a small battle, the struggle between the enemy and us was quite fierce. Within twenty-four hours, [missing text], not losing much ground. They just signed a hand [missing text], [missing text] of De Wen [missing text] the battle [missing text] held on, not letting [missing text] for a moment. Our main firepower consisted of only two [missing text] gun nests, deployed [missing text], one on the left, one on the right, about ten yards apart, launching [missing text] on the [missing text] bridge on the [missing text] north of the Huai River.</p>
<p>The enemy had plenty of firearms: rifles, grenade launchers, small mortars, and so on. On average, one of our machine gun nests was destroyed every two hours because there wasn't a very strong barrier. Fortunately, as soon as one was destroyed, another was replenished. They stubbornly held on for a whole hour.</p>
<p>The stretcher team was the only way to rescue the wounded here, but there weren't enough people. So the lightly wounded had to carry the heavily wounded to the temporary hospital in the rear. The routine washing, applying medicine, bandaging, or surgery were all done. Those who couldn't be saved were, of course, carried out to be buried. Those who could be saved were considered to have received good care. The only exceptional symptom was quite troublesome because there were too many casualties and there were no blood transfusion supplies here, so they had to lie there half-dead, relying on fate. The high fever caused them to groan, mutter, and shout wildly.</p>
<p>The night nurse was half sympathetic and half a little impatient. She saw the lightly wounded comrade guarding there, unwilling to leave. "Why didn't you get him here faster? Did you hit him?" The nurse was somewhat indignant.</p>
<p>"Reporting, squad leader, it wasn't on purpose, he just wouldn't leave." The Hunan accent was mixed with some out-of-province tones.</p>
<p>"Why?" The nurse was a little angry.</p>
<p>"Who knows… the devils are all gone, but he's still reluctant to let go." He sighed softly.</p>
<p>"What about the other brothers?" The nurse seemed to regain her sympathy.</p>
<p>Ten died, eight and a half! "The wounded felt miserable." If the squad leader doesn't believe my report, you can just go and see tomorrow, there are two gun nests, the mud underground is all red, turned into two pools of blood!</p>
<p>"What!" The nurse probably sensed the blood in those two mud pits, and her eyebrows furrowed immediately, as if she wanted to beat something out of her heart.</p>
<p>"This guy," the wounded soldier pointed to the one lying on the bed suffering from excessive blood loss, "his legs, ribs, shoulders, and head are all wounded by shrapnel… a shell exploded two or three meters to our right… he was bleeding all the way, a person only has two liters of blood in total, how can it not run out?"</p>
<p>The one lying on the bed, at this moment, his hands, feet, and whole body convulsed and trembled uncontrollably. His hoarse voice, mixed with phlegm, was weak and unintelligible, as if he was saying, "Mom… damn it… I just won't let you… come over!"</p>

<h3>Silence</h3>
<p>— Shao Fu</p>
<p>Today is August 13th, marking exactly ten years since that bloody historical drama of the Battle of Shanghai during the War of Resistance against Japan.</p>
<p>Ten years, like a dream. Ten years, although not a short time (how many decades does one have in life, really!), but everything at that time seems very clear, as if it were right before my eyes. Taking the nation as an account book, we can say that we have all contributed our capital in these ten years, or we can say that we have not fulfilled our full responsibilities.</p>
<p>Let us think, what kind of atmosphere permeated Shanghai ten years ago today, what kind of emotions did people have; what kind of atmosphere and emotions are there ten years later today?</p>
<p>Today, we are again facing a most serious juncture, the severity of which even exceeds that of ten years ago today, because foreign aggression can destroy a country, but internal strife can destroy it even more so. On the one hand, we remember the sacrifices and bloodshed of countless heroic soldiers; on the other hand, we truly feel fearful and horrified about the days ahead.</p>
<p>Truly, there are thousands of words, and I don't know where to begin.</p>
<h3>Not Empty Rhetoric – A Few Words for "August 13th"—</h3>
<p>— You Fu</p>
<p>"August 13th" is a sorrowful day in Chinese history, and also a happy day.</p>
<p>Nine years ago, it freed China from the shackles of being a semi-colonial state and issued the call of the Chinese nation to resist.</p>
<p>Coincidentally, on this day one year ago, the war finally ended in victory. It can also be said that "August 13th" symbolizes China's light and happiness.</p>
<p>Last year today, on every street in Chongqing, such as Guofu Road, Lianglukou, Fuzichi, Jingshengbaolei, Xiaoshizi, Minquan Road, Minzu Road, Zhongyi Road, and Zhonger Road, especially in front of the Broadcasting Building, there was an endless stream of people, listening to the good news of victory with smiling faces. That kind of jubilant mood expressed the infinite happiness that victory bestowed upon everyone, making everyone forget the suffering of the past eight years.</p>
<p>On the street, every passerby, upon seeing someone, would invariably ask, "When are you going home?" around "August 13th." In the days before and after, many people were controlled by the god of victory all day long, forgetting themselves, and even staying up all night.</p>
<p>On the veranda of the Broadcasting Building, two large speakers were placed, continuously broadcasting the good news of Japan's surrender to all of Chongqing. As a result, many people sat and stood on both sides of the stone steps of the Broadcasting Building all night long, listening to that enthusiastic report.</p>
<p>In Chengdu, groups of young men and women walked shoulder to shoulder on Chunxi Road. They nodded and smiled at each other, without distinguishing between people from Jiangsu and people from Sichuan, speaking intimately with an unprecedented harmony, and jointly strode along that lively street, encouraging each other with joy.</p>
<p>Other places such as Xi'an, Lanzhou, Kunming, and Guiyang also celebrated as jubilantly as Chongqing and Chengdu.</p>
<p>At that time, we imagined that the future of our motherland was immeasurably bright.</p>
<p>In the past year, the various things that have been manifested after victory have been heartbreaking!</p>
<p>There are political parties in the motherland who are enemies of the people, refugees from the Soviet Union are scattered everywhere, transportation cannot be restored, social order cannot be maintained, and corruption and malfeasance continue to occur, making it impossible for people to live and work in peace. Who would have foreseen this series of misfortunes a year ago!</p>
<p>Today is the first "August 13th" after victory. The work of demobilization and national reconstruction has been underway for a year, but everything is empty, everything is chaotic. In order to commemorate this sacred day—"August 13th"—we fervently hope that no one will be allowed to create civil war and undermine peaceful national reconstruction on the land of our motherland again. We no longer want to smell the gunpowder, and, moreover, all those who have escaped the law after collaborating with the enemy must be thoroughly and strictly dealt with! The orphans of all the soldiers who sacrificed their lives for the country must be effectively guaranteed! We cannot bear everyone feeling empty because of victory, and forgetting the historical day "August 13th"!</p>
<h3>Magic Trick</h3>
<p>— Shuang Ren</p>
<p>Everyone can perform magic tricks, but each has different skills. There are too many people in our country, both in and out of government, who can perform magic tricks. The higher the rank, the better the magic trick; there are also wealthy merchants who are masters of magic tricks.</p>
<p>How can the above be explained? Although magic tricks are ever-changing, to summarize it, it is nothing more than the two words "have" and "not have"; it is either "from nothing to something" or "from something to nothing."</p>
<p>Before high-ranking officials take the stage, their hands are empty. But once they get promoted, their value increases tenfold. As a result, they have foreign houses, cars, beautiful wives and concubines, everything they could want. Especially in insurance, there are all sorts of colours, dazzling the poor. Isn't this a magic trick of "from nothing to something"?</p>
<p>If corruption causes trouble, people report it, and the court investigates, as long as the position is prominent, officials will protect each other. The result is "no evidence found." This is a type of "from something to nothing" magic trick.</p>
<p>If all parties cannot understand this case and insist on "patting a fly on the tiger's head"; even the Control Yuan can't stand it and sends someone to investigate; if there is evidence, they will file an impeachment; then there are two final methods of playing the emergency card: one is fire, and the other is theft. This can turn what is there into nothing, a complete muddle. This is also a grand "from something to nothing" magic trick, but it is not easily performed unless it is the final act of the show.</p>
<p>Someone asked: "Is there any factual basis for fire and theft?" The author replied: "Of course, there is a factual basis. Aren't warehouses for enemy and puppet materials taken over in various places often catching fire? Weren't some of the archives of the former Shanghai Municipal Council suddenly stolen?" Ultimately, the result is one sentence: "Magic tricks are never a good phenomenon for a country"?</p>
<h3>A Smile</h3>
<p>— Ge Chunliang</p>
<p>Mr. Gilbert from Chicago and Mr. Li Bao from Qihai met on the beach where they were escaping the summer heat and became very close friends after two weeks. When they were preparing to go back, Li Bao insisted on inviting Gilbert to visit Qihai with him before returning to Chicago. So, Gilbert had a lot of fun at Li Bao's house and ate very well. After a few days, on Monday morning, Gilbert found a forty-dollar bill on his breakfast plate. "That's really absurd, you insisted on inviting me to stay for a week, how would I have come if you hadn't invited me, and now you want to charge me, there's no reason for that."</p>
<p>"Of course, I want money," Li Bao said, "otherwise why would I have invited you?"</p>
<p>The argument became more and more intense. Finally, Li Bao said, "I'll tell you what, let's go to the Jewish judge and let him judge this matter!" Gilbert finally obeyed. So they went to the local Jewish judge together and told him the complete details of the case. He listened to the matter very carefully and in detail, and then said, "Gilbert should pay the forty dollars." The Chicagoan was extremely angry, but because he had promised to let the judge decide, he had to give the forty dollars to Li Bao when he came out.</p>
<p>"Who wants your money? I never dreamed of taking your money!" Li Bao said.</p>
<p>"What do you mean?" The friend was confused.</p>
<p>"I've already taken you to see all the famous historical sites in Qihai," Li Bao said. "Now I'm just letting you see what a famous rascal the Jewish judge in Qihai is!"</p>
<h3>"August 13th – Skip a Meal!"</h3>
<p>— Xin Fang</p>
<p>"August 13th," this anniversary will forever be the greatest and most brilliant page left by the people of Shanghai in the history of China, and even in the history of the world.</p>
<p>Now that the War of Resistance has been won, China has embarked on a more difficult path. How to clean up the post-war ruins? How to start our construction work? The people of Shanghai should use the spirit of "August 13th" to create more glorious achievements for the new China of the future, but looking back at the situation in Shanghai today, I sincerely feel heartache; the people of Shanghai seem to have forgotten "August 13th," and also forgotten their own responsibilities to the motherland; "China is starving, Shanghai is dancing" isn't this the most scathing criticism of the people of Shanghai?</p>
<p>China's future must be bright, and the people of Shanghai will certainly not forget "August 13th." When commemorating "August 13th" this year, I hope that the people of Shanghai will launch a "skip a meal" movement. The homophony of "August 13th" and "skip a meal" is the same, but the greatest significance is still to hope that the general public in Shanghai can save some personal consumption. We don't have to go hungry for a meal, but at least every capable Shanghainese should donate the cost of one meal, then, many small contributions will make a great whole, and there will be a lot of work to do!</p>
<p>"August 13th" is a glorious day, but the glory of "August 13th" needs the people of Shanghai to take responsibility for maintaining it themselves.</p>
<h3>Comic Strip: The Adventures of Sanmao the Soldier (74)</h3>
<p>— by Zhang Leping</p>
<h3>A Few Words to Fathers (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Zhou Shang</p>
<p>2. Moral Cultivation—"When you have the capacity, then study literature." Our country has valued morality since ancient times. Now, morality is "on leave," and people's hearts are sinking. Fathers must put in extra effort in their children's character and behaviour, especially to supplement the school's training. The family is the only place for moral cultivation, and family education is the only place for moral cultivation. Family education is moral education. Etiquette is solemn, represented by the father, hence the saying "strict father." Music is harmonious, represented by the mother, hence the saying "kind mother." The combination is very reasonable. Children should feel a sense of awe and respect when they see their father, but you must not make them feel afraid. Fear can lead to lying and deception and other bad behaviours. The most important thing is to lead by example, to adhere to moral standards in conduct, position, words, dealings with people, opponents, and matters. You must absolutely and unconditionally believe in your beloved wife and in the Three Principles of the People for saving the country. This should be the case whether your children are present or not, and should be consistent throughout, so that you can have a subtle influence on them. You must clearly distinguish between righteousness and profit, and especially change your attitude towards money. Bacon said, "Money is a good servant, but a most dangerous mistress." You must abandon the worship of money. "It is a shame to be rich and honoured when the state is without the Way." This sentence should be explained in detail to the younger generation.</p>
<p>3. Academic Cultivation—It seems that our country's tradition places the responsibility of teaching on the father, hence the appearance of the Three Character Classic: "To nourish without teaching is the father's fault." If someone becomes famous through their mother's teaching, they are particularly praised, and the mother is in the limelight. After the Industrial Revolution, modern cities formed, and fathers let go of the matter of teaching their children and handed it all over to schools. Today, many fathers cannot afford to send their children to school, and they still need the generosity of people in society to help. In fact, there are still large numbers of children who can only sigh at the sight of schools. And school education has too many shortcomings. "Studying books to death, reading dead books, reading books to death," is the biggest problem. Fathers should often contact schools to promote active education, inspire children's creativity, and liberate their children's minds, hands, mouths, and time and space, so as to engage in creative work. In democratic life, learn democracy, teach children to understand how to realize the Three Principles of the People, that is, to practice democracy and socialism. Only parents know their children's personalities best, and perhaps fathers know them most clearly. The saying "No one knows a child like their father" is correct. You should teach them knowledge that adapts to society based on their personality, so as to match their future occupation. Chinese classics must be read, and foreign science must be caught up with. In elementary school, there is no need to stuff their minds like fish in a sand pond, leaving no room for gaps. Give them more opportunities for free activities. By the time they reach middle school, they must receive rigid and strict education.</p>
<p>4. Marriage Guidance—Marriage is not only a lifelong event for men and women, but also a lifelong event for the next generation, and even more so for the nation. The Doctrine of the Mean states: "The Way of Heaven and Earth begins with the relationship between husband and wife," affirming the importance of marriage. Marriage guidance is based on sex education. Many teachers have not yet married themselves, how can they take on this responsibility? Schools have many students, making it difficult to provide individual guidance. Therefore, the most suitable teachers for sex education are still parents, and the most suitable environment is the family. Sex education in the West has been renamed "Social Hygiene," which contains the biological basis of the race and has the effects of heredity and eugenics. In the past, our country paid attention to "matching social status" in marriage. Perhaps this is what it meant. Our country also advocates "men marrying at thirty and women marrying at twenty," which is even more reasonable from a scientific point of view. Early marriage is national suicide, and it has already harmed us. Sex education should start from a young age. If it comes suddenly in adolescence, it often causes emotional reactions, which may be worse than not teaching at all. The teaching should not be too much or too little, but honest and simple. This requires preparation, cultivation, and the ability to adapt to circumstances and evoke emotions based on the scene. "Sex" is like eating and dressing, there's nothing sneaky about it. Russell said it well: "To break down obscenity, first break down the mystery." I am an advocate of monogamy and "exclusive love." Psychologically, exclusive love can be learned as a habit. I always tell my eight children: "Before marriage, talk more about reason and less about love; after marriage, talk more about love and less about reason." This way, the tragedy of divorce can be reduced in the world. The psychology of love: in childhood it is self-love. In elementary school it is "same-sex love." At this time, there is often animosity between boys and girls. When they enter junior high school, they begin "opposite-sex love." Many abnormalities in love are mostly caused in childhood, such as spanking.</p>
<p>"The Way of the Father" is the backbone of Father's Day. If Father's Day ignores the Way of the Father, then what remains is only superficial activities, a lively event that does not take root. For the sake of family hatred, for the sake of national vengeance, for the sake of the construction of the entire nation, we must advocate "The Way of the Father."</p>
