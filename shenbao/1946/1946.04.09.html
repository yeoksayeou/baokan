<h3>陳誠周恩來討論停戰　東北調處困難正多　赴四平小組中途折回</h3>
<p>〔本報北平八日電〕渝軍事三人小組，對解決東北問題詳細方案，未獲協議，今日記者已自取可靠方面獲得證實。</p>
<p>〔合衆社重慶八日電〕今日在三人小組開會討論東北局勢發展之前，吉倫中將曾與蔣主席有　會商，周恩來昨與陳誠將軍會晤，討論停戰問題。報載三人小組已陷於停頓，但其他方面則論。在執行小組於東北奠定停戰之主要基礎後，三人小組可能成立另一協定，親自前往東北。同時，停止內戰之工作，已有不少落於執行總部執行組主任白魯德將軍之肩上。</p>
<p>〔本報北平八日電〕據官方表示，瀋陽有一中心小組，已足指揮其他小組，無成立執行分部必要。</p>
<p>〔本報北平八日電〕今日廿八執行小組已沿長鐵北上，至四平街一帶，廿九小組則南赴本溪　一帶，但彼等能否發生作用，猶不可知，因三方意見出入極大，若干困難實橫亘於調處工作之前，如與停戰有連帶關係之恢復交通與蘇軍即將撤退區域之接收工作，以及地方政權移轉諸問題，均極難解決。比等問題如不澈底解決，小組即無法有效執行調處工作，以是，今日小組雖已分途出發，但其工作實尙滯於象徵及準備階段也。</p>
<p>〔聯合社瀋陽八日電〕軍事調處執行總部兩小組，今晨啓程分赴東九省北部與東南部，調査　隊布防情形，每組備有卡車與吉普車六至八輛，車上裝無綫電，赴北部之小組，除國·共·大三方代表外，並有新聞記者數人，以柯萊上校爲首，往東南部小組由特萊克中校率領。</p>
<p>〔合眾社瀋陽八日電〕前往撫順煤礦區之執行小組，進行順利，未遇任何事故，派往四平街之另一小組，因橋樑（瀋陽北十二哩）被炸，已受阻於今日午後返潘。據該組組長柯萊上校謂：當該組人員滯留道旁，研討如何渡河之際，國軍士兵出而警告，謂前有武裝共軍，可能向該　施行翦徑行動，如欲前進，將有危險。惟該組之共黨代表孔彪少將向組內其他人員祖保謂，共軍不致騷擾。時國軍代表王昭公（譯音）中將建議謂：在繼續前進以前設一衛隊，或係一良策。寇萊則堅主如屬可能，彼等必須賡續執行使命而渡河，但事實證明爲不可能，該組乃折返潘陽。今日午後兩時半返此後，該組立即開始準備九日改乘火車出發之一切事宜。</p>
<p>〔又電〕東北共產軍司令林彪將軍之參謀長吳秀觀少將，今日第一次招待記者時，建議今後國共軍隊應聯合接收蘇軍所撤出之地區，認爲此乃停止東北戰事最妥善之辦法。又稱：「林彪將軍來瀋之時機尙未成熟，事實上由林彪將軍在其共產區之司令部接見白魯德將軍或美國其他代表，其可能性較大」。</p>
<h3>哈蘇軍三面撤退　董彥平昨由瀋陽飛返長春</h3>
<p>〔本報北平八日電〕由瀋出發接收蘇軍撤退區之國軍，其推進速度，超過報紙所已公布者，但最近因冰雪融化，道路泥濘及共軍阻遏加强關係，推進速度已見低减。</p>
<p>〔中央社哈爾濱八日電〕此間蘇軍現分向三方面撤退，一爲北方之黑河，一爲東方之綏芩之滿洲里，據悉，蘇軍將於四月廿六日以前全部撤出哈市。</p>
<p>〔又電〕今又有共軍三千人，出雙城縣進駐市區西方半拉城子，哈市情勢益形嚴重，惟迄今爲止，市內尙未發生事端。楊綽庵市長正冷靜應付一切。日昨曾與共軍負責人晤談，雙方表示決依政府指示，以和平原則解決一切問題。</p>
<p>〔中央社長春八日電〕董彥平八日午由瀋飛返此間，興安省蒙旗代表馬鳴周·陳庭瑞·韓愚儒及其隨員等同來。</p>
<p>〔中央社北平八日電〕東北保安司令長官杜聿明，近日精神甚佳，出院後經醫師檢査兩次，據云雖已康復，尙須休養，惟聞杜氏以東北軍務重要，將於旬日後專機飛瀋。</p>
<p>〔中央社長春八日電〕長春防務日漸鞏固，各街衢皆滿布障碍物，遇有變故發生，隨時均可加以封鎖，往日昂首闊步之不安份子，最近已吿歛跡，此種情形，頗足增加一般市民之安全感。若干敏感之軍方人士，以爲長春防務日固，已不致遭受攻擊。即稍有騷擾，亦可迅速制服。彼等最有力之論說，係近五日來市內平靜無事，市民得以安全，足證伺隙者已有戒心。然若干政界人士之看法，則與此相反，彼輩認爲目前之相安無事，乃暴風雨前夕之寗靜，長春為東北之政治樞紐，共軍決不致放過也。</p>
<p>〔又電〕蘇軍撤退聲中，市區保安隊及警察已展開全市之檢査運勁，大街小巷均密佈哨兵，遇有可疑之車馬行人，亦加以檢査，七日一日內即査獲手槍彈多箱，迫擊砲彈多枚及機關槍彈等物。</p>
<h3>保護蘇僑財產　我決盡其職責</h3>
<p>〔中央社長春八日電〕董彥平與蘇軍參謀長特洛曾科最後會談時，特氏曾提及長春蘇軍撤退後蘇僑民及其財產之保護問題，據稱：馬元帥之政治顧問即將開列蘇僑名單及財產淸冊，送交我方，希望我方予以保護。當時董氏答以渠決盡到渠之職責，但聲明長春將來是否陷於戰爭狀態，渠不敢料，在國軍接防部隊到來前，長春之警衛力量甚爲單薄，恐有保護不週之處。特氏稱：渠目前已無充份資料足以判斷長春將呈何種狀態，然如發生戰事，則偶然之損失自不能要求中國　責，惟渠稱：渠所要求負責者　為中國官方勿予加害蘇僑及其保有之財產，一如瀋陽之情形。董稱：渠對此絕對負責，然爲便於保護起見，將如瀋陽所行者，將蘇僑產業圍以鐵絲網，必要時並集中蘇僑於一地，特氏對此表示接受，最後董氏檢閱蘇方所送之財產淸冊，對其所有權頗表懷疑，已照會蘇方，重申負責保護之意，但聲明對各項產業之所有，當加以保留。</p>
<h3>蔣主席召見　渝市參議員</h3>
<p>〔中央社重慶八日電〕蔣主席今日上午十時在國府大禮堂召見渝市全體會議員講話，略謂，八年來政府與陪都市民，甘苦共嘗，對抗戰實有極大貢獻。今政府即將還都南京，願以（一）民衆福利與（二）地方治安兩事，付託諸位參議員，希望繼起負此重任。主席並與全體參議員合攝一影，以留紀念。</p>
<h3>浙主席沈鴻烈　明日赴杭接事</h3>
<p>〔中央社杭州八日電〕浙主席沈鴻烈，將於十日由滬來杭，定十一日接事。省府同人八日晨十時半在省府茶會，歡送黃主席，黃氏俟親自辦理交代後離省。</p>
<h3>全國商業團體會議　定本月廿八日在京舉行</h3>
<p>〔本報南京八日電〕勝利後第一次召集之全國性商業團體會議，聞已定本月廿八日在京舉行，該會係由社會部部召集，惟因收復區各省市商業團尙在整理期間，會議名稱暫以「全國商會聯誼會」爲名，聞全國各省市商會均將推代表出席，東北各省市商會，亦接獲通知，如交通無問題，亦將踴躍參加。代表名額的一百餘人，從本月廿日起開始報到，會議性質原爲聯絡感情，交換意見，但政府有關部門亦欲藉此機會，聽取各地商業領袖對於戰後發展商業之意見，以供參考，屆時社會部長谷正綱等均將參加。</p>
<h3>張治中視事　伊寗問題樂觀</h3>
<p>〔中央社迪化七日電〕張兼主席治中　八日先行視事，渠今向前任省廳人員宣布，所有各廳處負責人　，均暫行留職，僅省府秘書長一　，由行營秘書長劉孟純暫行接替。</p>
<p>〔又電〕據消息靈通人士稱，伊寗問題可望於週內成立協議，日來此間空氣頗為樂觀。</p>

<p>〔合衆社南京八日電〕中國政府高級人士預料：魏德邁二級上將，大約將在三個月返華，出任駐華大使。彼等稱：魏德邁於其假期中，將在華盛頓與各方舉行會議，並謂馬歇爾將軍將再度來華，作幾個月之逗留，而渠之計劃，則將由中國政府與共產黨在魏德邁以大使資格及美國軍事顧問團協助之下，予以實施。</p>

<h3>全國軍隊大檢閱　軍訓部釐訂方案呈候核定</h3>
<p>〔本報南京八日電〕據軍訓部總務廳副廳長魏鶴齡少將談，本年二月舉行之軍事復員會議，曾決定定期舉行全國軍隊大檢閱，現此一決議業經軍訓部厘訂方案，呈准最高當局核定後，即調集軍官中之有校閱經騐者，受嚴格訓練，此項訓練業已開始，校閱將分爲東南區·西南區·華中區·華南區·東北區·西北區·合灣區等，並設一主任校閱委員，人選將待最高當局決定·校閱期間約二星期，時期擬定於六月左右。又抗戰八年我國軍與敵作戰備極慘烈，爲求後方人民及各界人士明瞭國軍壯烈之戰，擬於國民大會開會時舉行陸空大演習，演習課目爲（一）對敵堅固防地之攻擊（由砲空運各兵種編成），（二）夜間村區防禦（空中補給），（三）戰塲心理演習，（四）偽裝與遮蔭演習，地點擇定本京滄波門外，演習部隊以駐防本京之七十四軍爲基幹，並調遣其他精幹部隊，且有空軍參加，地下部隊演習之服裝，一律新製，務求整齊一致，以便招待全體國民大會代表參觀。又悉，七十四軍司令部爲籌備演習，該軍邱維達師已從事各項準備，屆期將有精彩表演。</p>

<p>〔合衆社南京八日電〕高級權威方面人士謂：魏德邁中將與麥克魯少將所建議陸海空軍最高司令部改組計劃全部核准事，現正由蔣主席考慮中。魏麥二氏聲稱：該項計劃擬使現有之許多軍事組織及其駢枝者，合併爲兩個主要機構：（一）參謀總部，（二）國防部，該項計劃係仿照美國式，但更較簡單。中國將來之參謀總部，將包括一切空軍·陸軍·海軍與供應事務，一如美國之陸軍部，中國將來之國防部僅將成爲內閣中與軍隊聯繫之一部。戰時最高軍事機構軍事委員會，並未於魏麥二氏所提計劃內涉及，目前之航空委員會，在將來之參課總部下，將成爲一空軍司令部。該項改組計劃，一俟蔣主席批准，即行開始實行。新計劃主張廢棄現行駢枝之軍事機構，其中包括軍事委員會，軍令部，軍訓部，政治部，後勤總部，軍政部，及航空委員會。</p>

<h3>安全理事會遇新難題　蘇聯又提出要求　請勿再討論蘇伊事件　英美反對將西國問題列入議程</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕舊金山八日廣播：聯合國安全理事會決議延期至五月六日討論伊朗問題後，衆料此事可告一段落，但目前已又生枝節矣。昨今兩日所發生之新發展三項，頗堪注意：（一）安全理事會雖已決定延期討論伊朗申訴，但蘇聯猶不滿足，蘇代表葛羅米柯，昨又致函聯合國機構秘省長賴依，聲明上週安理會之決議，實屬非法，且與聯合國機構憲章背適而馳。並謂：伊蘇已成立協定，故蘇方堅決主張安理會議事日程中，應除去蘇伊案件。蘇伊兩國現行關係，更無危害和平與安全之處。（二）伊朗總理宣佈：蘇軍已撤退之馬才特倫省，有武裝隊伍圖謀叛變，伊軍已奉命立即開赴該地平亂。（三）蘇伊油公司協定內容業經發表，（見昨日本報）但今日莫斯科電台宣稱：沿伊朗伊拉克土耳其邊境之五十英里深之走廊，並不屬于伊蘇汕公司管轄範圍之內，開發伊朗北部油田之人員與機器，業已準備就緒，不日即可開工。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社紐約七日電〕聯合國機構秘書長賴依本日談稱：關於波蘭對西班牙問題之提案，本人尙未接到。同時蘇聯無綫電台宣布：蘇聯駐美大使葛羅米柯已致函安全理事會，要求伊朗問題除出議程。此間聯合國人士聞悉之餘，頗爲驚異，咸謂：按照向例，任何文件至少須俟從出安全理事會兩小時之後，始能公布，蘇聯此舉，實屬達反慣例。觀於葛羅米柯函件之宣布，與波蘭代表決定以西班牙問題向安全理事會提出，適在同時，可見蘇聯又有發動外交攻勢之可能。聞安全理事會主席郭泰祺，巳要求將莫羅米柯之函件，立即譯出。</p>
<p>〔聯合社紐的七日電〕波蘭提議將西班牙問題於本星期內提出聯合國安全理事會討論，今日據可靠俏息，美英兩國已準備反對此項主張。英美方面宣稱：波蘭指責弗朗哥政府危害世界和平，除非能提出意外之緊急報吿，則各該國政府將以前次次復法國者，同樣答稪波蘭。</p>

<h3>闢似是而非的聯合政府論</h3>
<p>重慶合衆社七日電，周恩米將軍今日警吿謂，如須負起制立民主與重建國家之工作，中國之聯合政府，應即於六個月內行使其政權。在與合衆社遠東經理伏恩，合衆社記者雷文霍，及洛杉磯時報記者特雷克等歷時一小時之晤談中，周氏曾就恢復沿海城市曁解放區內繁，榮所繫渠所認爲最重要之先決問題，演述其梗概。渠堅持謂：惟有一聯合之政府始能克服「今日國內根本上最嚴重之危機，即中國安定經濟之迫切需要」。在對外國記者前，强調其所謂聯合政府之必要，周恩來氏及其他中共方面人士固已為一貫的作風，但所謂聯合政府，實有解釋一番的必要。使用名詞而沒有確定界說，不特易致朦混，抑且招致名實不符。</p>
<p>在國外，聯合政府這個名稱是指原有的政府推翻了以後，沒有一個政黨在議會裏擁有多數，可以出來單獨負責組織政府，必須聯合其他政見多少相同的政黨來共同負起責來組織政府，因有所謂聯合政府之稱。再則一國甫經革命，各黨勢均力敵，任何一黨沒有單獨組織政府的力量，須與其他政見相同的政黨携手合作，組織所謂聯合政府。故所謂聯合政府之組織，其主要前提爲原政權的推翻，而代之以一個新政權，而道個新政權又是聯合各政見大體相同的黨向議會負責而組織的，這纔是所謂聯合政府的一般形態。並且這種形態的政府也實在並非民主憲政的常軌。</p>
<p>自國民政府召開治協商會議以來，即希望在維持國內和平局勢原則之下，由各黨各派共同參加實際政治的中樞機構，使國民政府有更廣大的基礎。此與一般國家所謂的聯合政府根本是兩件事。因爲政協會議所以有此協議，其主旨在加強國民政府，而非削弱或推翻國民政府。這裏由很簡單。第一，中國國民黨致力於民族解放運動者垂五十年，本革命的進展，有自軍政歷訓政以至憲政的三個時期。抗戰以前，原有實施憲政的決意，其後雖以戰事而停頓，但抗戰旣告勝利，政府一本初衷，即籌備實施憲政。而且在國民大會未曾行使其職權，我國尚未正式走入憲政階段以前，爲集中憲志增厚國力計，乃更就現行法統，邀請各黨各派參加政府，共負實際政治責任。故現階段各黨各派之參加政府，在憲政時期未正式降臨以前，國家所依據的大法還是訓政時期的法。這依舊是以國民黨爲中心的政府，不過爲顧全客觀事實，就現有的規模，爲必要的改組及擴充而已。這根本說不上是聯合政府。第二，聯合政府以推翻原有政權爲前提，且須對國民或國民代表機關負責。目前對國民負責者，顯然仍應爲二十年國民會議制定的法時所賦予權力之國民政府。故各黨各派在現階段的情形下參加政府，不在推翻現政權，而在充實現政權。這根本不是一種聯合政府的組織。周恩來氏及其他中共人士，若還明知故昧，一再强調聯合政府的組織，其用意是否在推翻現政權而代之以一種新的所謂聯合政權，我們無須加以測知。但我們要聲明的：中國不需要有所謂聯合政府的組織，本中國國民黨的政策，及蔣主席的昭吿，我們祗能容許就現有的體制下，對政府爲必要的充實；而除了未來的國民大會制定憲法以外，沒有一個人或一個機關可以有權力取消或修改的法，也沒有一個人或一個機關可以在未來的民選政府以前先來推翻合法的國民政府！</p>
<p>我們須記取中國國民黨以革命的武力而取得政權，還政於民是國民黨統治的終極目標。等到國民大會召開制定憲法以後，本此憲法而有國民政權的行使時，纔是憲政之治的開端。在此以前，包括現階段在內，還是訓政時期。在這個時候，先邀各黨各派共同參加政府，正足以表示國民黨天下爲公約夙志。誠如本報昨日社論所云：「本來，一個國家的軍令政令應該絕對統一。一國之內，而容許黨派擁有軍隊，甚至進一步承認共軍爲一單位，對共軍與政府軍隊之間執行調處，站在嚴正的軍紀立塲來講，已經是笑話奇談。」同樣，目今憲政之治尙未正式開始，正式民意機關尙未成立，民意是否要在國民黨以外另選他黨執政尙不可知，而於此際，國民政府先自動邀請各黨各派參加政府，站在嚴正的國民革命立塲，也已經是笑話奇談。可是中國國民黨一本天下爲公約夙志，爲讓戰後的老百姓早得休養生息起見，於是有「政協」的召開。有對各黨各派參加政府的邀請。而若干人士竟認此爲聯合政府的組織，掛羊頭想賣狗肉，這祗足以欺一般沒有政治常識之徒而已。</p>
<p>總之，中國値長期兵燹之後，我們固然需要安定的秩序，使人民有個休養生息的機會；即國際的局勢亦不許我們有政治上的紛爭，致使我國的政局動盪不安，中國國民黨爲目今執政的政黨，默察這種國內外局勢，衷誠期望各黨各派爲了民族利益起見，一致協力於實際政治的參加。聯合政府云云，於破壞現有法統之中，語近刺激，不是喁喁望治的中國人民所期待的。我們願各黨各派以民族利益爲上，使人民多看見些披肝瀝膽的合作，少來一些乖張刺激的議論！</p>

<h3>十一次參議會一致通過　保障身體自由案　請市府轉飭軍警機關一體遵守　主張請中央機關代表出席報告</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕上海市臨時參議會，昨晨九時十五分，舉行第十一次大會·並紀念週·到參議員三十三人，秘書長項昌權報吿大會致蔣主席電，已由國府文官處覆電收到，最近報到之余稚敬·嚴　宇，徐國懋三參議員，列入第二組審査委員會。</p>
<p>大會通過　請建立忠烈靖</p>
<p>大會開始由徐士浩報吿調査善後救濟總署物資，是否全部救濟人民，據劉鴻生答覆確作全部救濟人民之用，並未劃作辦公經費。繼由經議長將第一組審査提案徵求大會意見，計通過提案三件：（一）請市府建造抗戰殉國忠烈祠，建立抗戰殉難烈士紀念塔，建立抗戰殉難烈士公墓，（二）請中央在各地代表民額中增加工人代表名額。（三）請衛生局設立健康硏究指導機構。研究關於國民健康問題及方法，指導實施，並在學校及工廠切實推行，以期增進國民健康，努力生產，完成建設，擬請市府採納原則，斟酌辦法，切實施行。以上提案均由沈春暉詳加說明。又工警局工作報吿審査人周學湘報吿審査經過，由秘書長宣讀原報吿，經各參議員主張將審査結果提交大會議決，暫不討諭。</p>
<p>臨時動議　保障身體自由　　吳副議長報吿由三分之二以上議員簽名，向大會臨時動議關於依法保陣人民身體自由一案，請市政府轉知警備司令部警察局及其他有關機關，確切遵守後開法定程序：（一）人民之拘提或逮捕，應依刑事訴訟法第七十七條第三項之規定，除現行犯外，必須先由檢察官或推事簽發拘票。（二）逮捕或拘禁之犯罪嫌疑人，應依訓政時期約法第八條第二項之規定，必須於二十四小時內，移送審判機關。（三）移送犯罪嫌疑人，應依刑事訴訟法第一一〇八條第二項之規定，必須實際將犯罪嫌疑人移送，不得僅以案件移送，而將犯罪嫌疑人聲請繼續由其覊押。純各參議員一致附議通過。但對手續方面各有意見，王艮仲提議此案應單獨成立。潘序倫主張爲加强議決案起見，應加添第四點即：如執行機關有違反上項辦法者，應嚴予處罰。徐士浩則表示法律上對已規定條例，未合法執行者，向有判裁辦法，不必加添一項。最後由沈春暉提議將此案交與即將由律師公會組織之自由保障協會負責辦理。</p>
<p>派員報告　引起熱烈議論</p>
<p>關於邀請中央各有關機關，派員出席報吿事，又引起各參議員一番熱烈議論。呂恩潭問上次大會要求中央有關機構出席報告及答覆詢問，何以告至今音訊全無？徐議長當即報，現已收到者，有經濟部敵產處理局報告一份，其他各機關，如不作表示，對於參議會似失面子，決請市府轉知。趙班斧即起立說：失面子是小事，參議會丢個面子又有什麽關係。我們如果覺得沒有正式權力可請他們來報吿，那末可以請他們來指敎。詹文滸則表示臨時參議會即將結束，費了許多金錢，時間，精力，我們對於當前最嚴重的問題如物價，房屋，善後救濟物資，是否已解決？是否對得起市民？要請各位檢討。至於直接請中央派員報告則根本不贊成，應當運用技巧，　市長及各局局長出席報告，如果他們處理不了，則請　　當局出席討論。並提議留出二次大會之時間爲報告之用。局學　表示附議，請中央有關機構　　報吿，尤其對於房歷，倉庫，物資及物價等要特別注意。結果　傳統先作一結論：「大家不必討論，一定請中央派員報告。」奚副議長提議在星期三上午，請市府負責人報吿，王艮仲問除子　產局報吿已收到外，其他單　怎樣當出席。范才　說糧食部，燃料委員會，及中國紡建公司籌亦不可漏掉。結果議長報吿，　他單位中有一部份已取消報告，日僑管理會叧有主管，不　顧問。　長問：「現在付表決，究竟要不要出席報吿」？全體舉手。十一時散會，下午舉行第四次分組審査會。</p>
<p>今日中午　全體舉行野餐</p>
<p>大會日程略在變更，今日上午爲第十二次大會，下午第五次分組審査會，明日上午第十三次大會，由市政府轉請中央特派機關代表報吿，下午第十四次大會討諭宣言，並舉行休會式。今日中午，全體參議員在金神父路三民主義靑年團上海支團部，舉行野餐，新聞記者亦被邀參加。</p>

<h3>偽糧統會秘書長　周純裕定期宣判　偽監察官曹耀庭謂遭誣告許姖傳弟兄否認供職偽府</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕高院昨晨審理漢奸　偽檢察官曹耀庭謂遭誣告罪嫌案兩起：</p>
<p>曹耀庭　（一）曹耀庭四十七歲，本地人，戰前曾任南市地方法院書記官及第二特區法院錄事等職。戰起即參加僞方，在「七十六號」內担任聯絡員，脅迫司法界人員背叛祖國，並自任僞檢察官。勝利後，被高檢處依法起訴。該案已數度審訊。昨又提訊，被吿除對出任僞檢察官謂爲被逼外，其他一概否認。指係誣吿，並邀郭孝先陳一鳴兩人作證。</p>
<p>許姬傳許源來　（二）許姬傳，四十七歲，許源來，四十三歲，浙江海寗人，爲兄弟倆。近在本市淸査戶口，由警局査得許姬傳曾任僞國民政府文官處參議，許源來曾任偽財政部所得稅局秘書。由高檢處偵査，認爲觸犯懲治漢奸條例，提起公訴。昨日被吿等於庭上聲稱：因卅二年敵僞在上海辦有自警團，須輪値站崗，當時又有抽丁謠言。爲免役計，故由老父僞造名義，代爲虛報掩護。實則一爲骨董鑑定商，一在交通銀行任事，根本未曾參與僞職，可請庭上調査云。並延秦綬章等律師辯護。庭諭以上兩案尙待調査，改期再訊。被吿還押。</p>
<p>下午續開合議庭審訊兩起：</p>
<p>周純裕　（一）周純裕，四十三歲，寗波人，一度由袁股登之邀，出任僞米糧統制會秘書長。後在卅三年十一月任內，被控凟職，判處五年徒刑，正在執行中。勝利後，由高檢處重再提訊，認爲觸犯懲治漢奸條例，提起公訴。被吿對曾任僞職供認不諱，但稱，曾盡力促配戶口米。後因與日人意見衝突，故被逮捕判刑云。檢察官以通謀敵國，代爲妝集軍糧罪起訴，被吿延黃能忍律師答辯。</p>
<p>黃俊傑　（二）黃俊傑，廿九歲，南匯人，曾於卅二年八月，充任僞上海保安司令部偵査隊隊員，於卅四年二月二日在星洲旅館二號拘捕抗日地下工作人員楊執中·楊玉廣·蔣壽來等送部判刑。茲經被害人告發，由高檢處偵査完畢，提起公訴。但被吿堅不承認曾任僞職及有逮捕楊執中等事。並延唐懷羣律師辯護。</p>
<p>以上兩案辯論終結，庭論十五日下午二時宣判。</p>
<h3>查封日僑遺屋　分十五組辦理　處理此項空屋將有新法頒佈</h3>
<p>本市軍政當局，爲處理日僑遺歸後所遺空屋，業由市政府，淞滬警備總司令部，第三方面軍及敵僞產業處理局，組織一聯合機構，共同調査辦理。總計目下日僑集中區之房屋共爲八千餘幢，頃於本月五日起，於日僑遺歸後，暫予封査，以杜糾紛。負責調査及査封之人員，均係各有關機關遴派，共分十五組，分別執行査封工作。昨日上午十時，此十五組工作人員，特在戰俘管理處舉行工作檢討會，出席警備總部王處長公遐等四十餘人，公推戰俘管理處副處長鄒任之爲主席。首由各組報吿調査與査封悄形，末並討論工作之困難。據悉：本市日僑所遺之空屋八千餘幢，均需經過調查，一俟處理是項空屋之新法頒佈，即依新法處理。蓋前日僑集中區內。以日僑撤離較遠，多遭不肖之徒，非法强佔，當局爲謀自大後方來滬之公敎人員，得有棲所，同時並爲保障業主權益起見，故決定共同管制日僑所餘之空屋云。</p>

<h3>價值逾萬萬元　倉庫中深夜刧去　顏料八十箱　上船運走被警制止匪徒逸去原贓追獲</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕北蘇州路九四四號敵偽產業處理局保管之某倉庫，昨晨二時四十分，忽來身穿軍服及便衣等能徒卅餘名進門後，將請願警數名及小工等，一一用繩捆縛，並用棉被掩蓋其頭部，禁勿聲張。將價値一萬萬元以上之顏料八十箱肩運而出。斯時適有保衛團班長一人上前探視，反遭痛毆。各匪徒將貨潛運至南首蘇州河下船，向西駛去。當時被北站分局巡邏警兩名瞥見，一警亟用電話向分局報吿，另一警士在吹警笛，拔步追趕。至西藏路新垃圾橋中央市塲西，該警乃向駐在附近之閘北分局派出所報吿，會同兜捕。同時北站分局盧碧湖分局長，偕刑事股長李葭初，親率武裝幹警多名，乘警備車馳往。因時値深夜黑暗異常，船上匪徒卒被向岸上遁去，所有全部贓物連同舟子三名，及船一艘，一併扣留，舟子等帶回分局究辦。出事時該倉庫內一請願警之槍械，曾被刧去，嗣仍在屋內找獲。</p>

<h3>殺害美飛行員案　澤田茂歸罪東京</h3>
<p>今日將爲最後一庭</p>
<p>審訊已達四週之杜立德將軍所屬飛行員被殺害案，今日將爲最後一日審訊。昨日庭上再度質問第十三軍司令澤田茂中將，上海江灣法庭審判官和光勇精上尉，及檢査官岡田隆平，被吿辯論律師立田外次郞等。澤田茂被審問達四小時之久，據年已五十有九之日第十二軍司令稱：彼在軍隊服務已有四十年，曾被日政府派到土耳其·波蘭·巴西·等國任駐外武官。並曾兩度遊歷英·美·法·瑞士·等國。一九四一年至一九四五年，派來上海，主第十三軍。有妻一·子二·均在日本。澤田茂對於杜立德飛行員之被殺，歸罪於東京政府。並稱：彼實無權處決，蓋東京有訓令，以爲此案情重大，一切須受東京政府之指示。但彼承認曾簽字於判決書上。和光勇精乃日太軍事法庭審判官，亦被審問。檢査官岡田隆平被審間時，承認未與各犯會而即行開審，彼等對於該三名飛行員之底蘊，只在彼等之口供中得知之。原吿辯論律師根據各點，以爲彼等不對該案檢査淸楚，即加宣判，太不合法。最後，傳立田外次郞出庭，此人髮已花斑，留短鬚。被審問時，三番四覆，更改其答案。至五時，主審官宣佈今日再審。</p>
<h3>中紡公司職員　中止集團「請假」　薪津照　生活指數發給</h3>
<p>國營中紡公司所屬各廠職員以其待遇與民營紗廠相較，尚嫌菲薄。日前提出（一）底薪提薪提高，（二）按照市府生活指數給與津貼之要求，否則昨晨即作集團「請假。」該公司總經理束雲章，昨晨特召集各廠負責人，懇切談話，勸導認識大體，努力生產。後經各廠代表分別向所屬職員解釋，結果取消成議，未曾釀成風潮。按中紡公司以各廠職員脅於民營紗廠待遇較優，恐影響生產，於二月份起，由董事會議決，職員薪津改爲按照市府生活指數發給，其原則以最高不得超過卅萬元。</p>
<h3>中央印製廠昨招待報界</h3>
<p>說明工潮經過</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕中央印製廠，爲使各界明瞭此次該廠工潮解決經過起見，昨日下午四時，特假康樂酒家，招待本市新聞界。出席各報社記者約二十人。當由該廠廠長高傑氏起立報吿，略稱：該廠爲國營印鈔機構，勝利後奉令來滬接收前僞中儲印刷所，開印鈔券，已歷半載。該廠深知生產效率，與工人待遇，必須配合；故半年來，常將工人待遇，按月調整。最近更頒佈技衛獎懲規則，如工人能努力遵行，則每月如男徒可得六萬餘元，兩級技工可得八萬餘元，乙級技工可得十萬餘元，甲級技工可得十二萬餘元；如每日加班三小時，則更可多得百分之五十。此種標準，視一般同業均高，而工方仍不滿意，遽於三月廿五日無端停工，事前亦不推派代表，或呈送書面報告。雖迭經廠方布吿復工，社會局派員調解，均吿無效，致廠中工作停頓四日。旋經廠方査得，此次怠工事件，顯有少數份子操縱。因於三月卅日佈吿，嚴令各工人即日復工，吾則即予開除等情；一面並將此少數份子約一百廿五人之名單查出，公佈關除。當日多數工人聞訊，即來廠復工。迨四月一日，則已全部復工。現底薪及開除工人之復職問題，決廳候社會局仲裁辦法決定，遵照辦理。最後渠又離明該廠　　　營機構，斷無所　資方剝削勞方等情形，深望全廠上下，能　　共濟，以底於成云。</p>

<h3>救濟食糧到大批　分配辦法尚待商討</h3>
<p>週來本市食糧到貨，極為充沛，尤以聯總運來之救濟物資，其中食糧亦幾佔三分之二。連日抵滬船隻已開始卸貨者，有吉佛遜號小麥六三六七噸，沙門號小麥麵粉及米五二四三噸，烏　頓號小麥牛奶等三一三五噸，紐西蘭號小麥麵粉等三一七〇噸。此項大量食糧，將作如何分配，則尙待當局會商確定。</p>
<h3>全部對號入座　影院極感困難</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕茲據本市電影院商業同業公會某職員語記者稱：設本市警局管理電影院之辦法，全盤付諸實施，則本市影院，迨將被逼停業。尤以警局最近規定，自本月十九日起，所有頭二輪影院十五家，均應辦理全部對號入座。此點使各影院更難於應付。蓋各影院正廳座位，向不對號。今須叧印對號入座票，非惟印刷費用浩繁，且未售出者，即成廢票，徒增無形損失。又院方因此又須添雇大批領座人員，薪津負担更重。而大部觀衆，因已持有對號票，勢將遲至開映時，始倉促入塲，反致影響影院秩序。該業自當局開征百分之五十娛樂稅後，營業已一落千丈，雖云最高票價已提高一倍，即一〇八〇元，然視戰前最高票價二元計算，不過增加五百四十倍，而影院營業各項費用之支出，已二三千倍於戰前，故深感維持爲難。有時不得已每日開映四塲，以期有所彌補，而警局將實行之規定中，則僅准在週日或假日開映四塲，其他各日，限映三塲，此於各院之營業收入上，影響尤大云。</p>

<p>外幣美鈔仍隨金價進退，晨初在一九一〇元左右，不久即退入一九〇〇元內，業外雖有結進，無如缺乏投機活動，買方終被壓倒，午刻在一八八〇元左右盤旋，對黃金套頭在七六〇元對十兩，頗多套購，以致午後形勢較金市爲挺，結果較上週六跌三十五元，港票亦吿盤小，結果老貨跌二十元，新貨跌三十元，羅比四九〇元，港電三九〇元，均有賣戶。</p>

<h3>米糧到源尚多　市況先堅後疲　油價猛跌五六千</h3>
<p>昨日米市早堅午疲，中關粳米略升，秈元仍無榮辱，麵粉買賣兩稀，趨勢平站，黃豆去化不振，價低千元，豆餅胃呆，亦小二三百元，麩皮降二三百元，生仁外埠及本街消化均懈，下挫二三千元，棉餅以燃料多數均用柴油，故消塲呆滯，亦小三四百元，油市以靑島續有大批抵申，供多於求，市化淸淡，開盤後猛烈下跌，共小五六千元，後形仍難預測。</p>
<p>又訊，據米市場消息，昨日本市計到白粳等七種，共一萬一千餘石，其種類及石數如下，白粳四·七三四石，薄稻二·五〇五石，早稻一·八〇五石，羊秈八〇一石，杜秈八三一石，白元二〇〇石，陰元一三〇石。</p>

<h3>紗價大跌　紡建增加標售次數</h3>
<p>昨日紗市跌落甚巨，緣單純織廠之製成品，旣感不敷紗價成本，復有滯銷之處，故近旬日間，迄無採辦原料之意，客銷亦因內地價格不振，而買意殊懈，致人心大軟，市上一片賣出聲，成交絕稀，變馬跌去十萬，其餘約降六八萬，午時紡建公司掛牌。紗綫自一支起至一百支止，共有廿五種之多，廿支標價又小六萬，卅二支標小八萬，四十支以上標小十萬至廿七萬，以六十支陽鶴單紗降低廿七萬爲最厲，綜觀紗業及布廠染織廠承購者極少，又據紡建公司公吿，自即日起，改於每星期一三五開售棉紗，二四六開售棉布，三六開售呢絨等品，似此標售機會更多，物價必因是而益見抑平。</p>
<h3>現棉市況疲軟</h3>

<p>昨據煤球業消息，本市各大型機製煤球廠義泰興南洋國華靈方精華信孚等，頃已先後裝就機件，並獲得充分製球所需煤屑及電力，刻已次第恢復生產，故煤球生產量大見增加，聞各廠獲得原料，尙稱低廉，故製球成本亦低，一般以手搖機製球者，顯已無法進展，現均另謀善策，或擴充範圍，或停止生產云。</p>

<p>專論</p>
<h3>對於今後高等敎育的幾點意見</h3>
<p>— 董啓俊</p>
<p>敎育文化，是國家的命脈，而高等敎育，尤足以決定一國的前途。戰時高等敎育病態百出，已無容諱言，現在各校復校在即，建設將始，我對於今後之高等敎育，願提出若干的管見，以供當道之抉擇，並與社會賢達商榷之：</p>
<p>（一）遷校問題　戰時各大學及專科學校什九內遷，勝利以後，自將作文化之復員。中樞對於遷校一點，雖胸有成竹，然各校對此不但造成與中央之裂痕，即學校內部，亦弄得糾紛疊起，意見不一。我認爲遷校問題關係一國民族文化前途至巨，政府必須有一個通盤合理的計劃，付之實施。</p>
<p>戰前各高等學校多集中於平，京，滬，而戰時則多集中於重慶，成都，昆明，及其附近。我們對於戰前戰時這種畸形的現象都不能表示贊同，我認為學校不能作畸形的集中，而應作普遍之發展。我們在戰前與戰時已犯了分配不均的毛病，在戰後實不能再蹈其覆轍。現在我們應以人口爲比例，凡人口在四十萬以上的城市皆應設大學或專科學校一所；每一省會應設大學及師範學院一所；而僻遠省份的城市，雖人口不足四十萬而在二十萬以上，以其文化水準之低落，為求推進計，也有設置大學及專校之必要。此不僅「因人制宜」，亦且「因地制宜」，譬如說，上海，漢口，天津，廣州，以其爲全國著名的商埠，除設普通大學外，更有設立商科大學之必要，他如東北富於礦藏，應設礦冶學校，太湖流域應設蠶桑學校，西北應設農校，浙江沿海應設水產學校，皆為因地制宜必有的措施。</p>
<p>戰後各校紛謀復校，而敎育當局謀敎育文化普遍之發展，在已定合理的通盤計劃下，應力排衆議，而應將若干的大學及專校留守於後方。（未完）</p>

<h3>康藏邊陲二三事</h3>
<p>— 三月廿八日康定通訊　鄧中簡寄</p>
<p>像謎一樣的邊疆，在抗戰期中，終於爲我們揭去了它秘密的幕單，現在記者試記述一向神秘莫測的康藏邊陲，給本報讀者嘗鼎一臠。</p>
<p>鄧通餓死　孔明造箭</p>
<p>漢文帝時，有一個術士，善相人，文帝命相其倖臣鄧通，術士謂必餓死，帝以至尊倖臣奈何令餓死，乃故封以四川銅山，意思是使他的錢，永用不竭，某次帝患瘡，鄧通以舌舐之，果愈，時景帝尙爲太子，文帝乃喟然嘆曰：「親如太子，尙不若一臣」，致觸景帝忌，及立爲帝，即下之獄，終應術士言而餓死。據說今日西康榮徑縣，即當日銅山所在，又今日川康重鎭康定，即昔日諸葛武侯南征時，命大將鄭迎建爐造箭處，故又名打箭爐。</p>
<p>滿面黧黑　狀似鬼怪</p>
<p>旅行康藏的人，大多走康定，經甘孜，昌圖到達拉薩，路上你所碰見的人，許多都用紗布蓋眼，或者塗得滿面油黑，使你莫明其妙，猶如白天見鬼，但請不要怕，這不過是他們反抗自然的保護作用。因爲康藏地勢過高了，山地都拔海一萬英尺以上，終年積雪，而山間谷地，蒸發又快成爲蓋着一層稀薄的白鹽或蘇打的半乾谷地，倘若你出門時，不戴上一塊紗布，你會慼到四面八方反射過米的陽光，使你十分顯炫，甚至患上色盲症，而康藏風季，狂風吹來，肌膚爲裂，民間歌謠都說「正二三雪封山，四五六泥沒足，七八九正好走，十月臘皮開拆」所以出門時臉上塗上一層黑色的油脂，就是要避免皮膚的拆裂。</p>
<p>叫人上學　如抽壯丁</p>
<p>康省東部窮鄉僻壤的小村中，居然也可以發現不少公立小學，有的設廟宇中，但學校雖多，學生極少，每所不過十幾名，其中且有不少禿頭的小沙尼，學生全部是公費，而家長仍不願送子弟入學。政府不得已下令按保分派，各保十人，故有「學差」之名，且有寗出資雇人頂替者，這是因爲地瘠人稀，雖小孩亦要參加生產之故，而敎科書和他們的生活水準亦相差太遠了。</p>
<p>喇嘛世界　天界佛國</p>
<p>康藏兩地平均每家均有三人以上出家，可見喇嘛之多，計分爲黃紅白黑四大派，都受人尊崇，甚至有以分飲其小便爲榮，而以其大便爲藥者，因爲喇嘛衆多，自然廟宇林立了，光是玉樹至康定途中，便有四十餘所，每所小則百人多則一二千人，廟宇都寬敞宏大，容量驚人，更有神奇的傳說與聖蹟，拉薩附近的三大寺：者蚌寺，一間殿內便大柱百二十根，宏障可見，寺內容喇嘛九千人，太朝寺是文武公主下嫁時所建，內有來自印度的釋迦佛像，傳說此佛像半爲人工，半自成，此殿可容三千三百人；塞日啊寺則有僧五千五百，喇嘛是政治經濟勢力的掌握者，勢力甚大，此外在偏鄙荒僻之處，尚有殺人之邪敎徒，他們以爲多殺未至死期的人，便可代享其未來之福。</p>
<p>在康藏中，甚至一山一洞，河池湖沼，無不有神奇傳說，藏南著名高山比比拉山，雖有野人存在，但均認爲咱日山峯，是最上密宗法輪，故能繞山項一次，可得六字大明咒十三億功德，繞山腰一次，可得三十億六字大明咒功德，所以遊人不絕，又藏南聖祠與聖母海相傳能照出一切願望與一生結果，爲陽間孽鏡台，據說達賴十三世即由此海照出而尋獲，總之此種神話，俯拾即是，使整個康藏不啻爲天界佛國了。</p>
<p>一妻多夫　母系社會</p>
<p>在我們中國，一夫多妻是司空見慣，而一妻多夫就恐怕只有見諸康藏了。所謂一妻多夫，譬如一家弟兄三人，共娶一妻，子女不論誰生，概屬老大，但對外則稱曰：「某某婦人之子女」，而視老二老三爲叔叔，三人中如一務農，一當喇嘛，一行商，回家則分享家庭之樂，夜間當一弟兄先與同宿時，則將佛珠懸諸門首，後來者在門上摸一摸，見有佛珠便悄然離去，絕不引此惹起衝突，在打箭灶·甘孜·達吉嶺等地，甚至有使密友分享其妻子之愛者，與愛斯基摩人，眞是無獨有偶了。康藏又盛行上門婿的風習，故家庭中以女子爲中心，內外大小事宜，女子一言便決，西藏復有所謂臨時婚姻，緣經商康省者，多自陜甘川滇遠道而來，每往即三五年，乃臨時與當地女子結合，及去即離，事前雙方約定，各不追究。</p>
<p>火葬水葬　天葬獸葬</p>
<p>康廠的葬禮也極奇特，分火葬·水葬·天葬·獸葬四種·據說·天葬是岳公爺（岳鍾麟）所創，　岳氏主藏時，見到處龍脈，深恐藏人子孫爲患中國，故勸以死後喂鷲而不必埋葬，又有，以其起源，乃因喇嘛相信人死後喂鳥，乃最直載了當的脫離陰世間而再度轉生的方法，天葬的方法是將屍體兩膝東於額下兩旁，以大衣包起運往葬塲，送葬喇嘛沿途　經呼喚，招鷹鷲來，於是千萬天鷲，由黑鷲領導，隨殯隊而盤旋，及抵葬塲，乃解衣蓋頭，先由死者親朋將屍切成卍字形，再由密宗喇嘛吹脛骨喇嘛，招烏下食，倘羣鳥久久不下，則是死者生前有罪，再由密宗喇嘛多方引　，甚或以刀鈎切成塊塊而食之，驚鳥始下，此時親朋旁坐喝酒飲茶，約歷一小時，肉畢骨存，便以骨碎爲粉，和以粑粑，再飼鷲鳥’最後復碎頭顱，仍和粑粑作成丸子，使烏來食，至點滴不餘始歸。</p>

<h3>對當前東北局勢之共同呼籲</h3>
<p>（一）</p>
<p>近聞軍事調處執行小組將派往東北，以解決東北九省國共衝突問題，逖聽之下，不勝惶惑！査東北於光復前，向無共軍之活動，光復後，始有多數非法武裝部隊潛行竄入，燒殺擄掠，擾亂地方，似此匪賊行爲，政府自不能認爲有任何組織之軍隊，且據中共發言人之表示：東北無共軍，當爲國人所盡知。依據一月十日停止衝突命令，國軍開入東北，不受任何限制，此亦為中共所同意。復據中蘇友好條約之規定，蘇軍撤退後即將東北交由國民政府接收，則東北之接收，純係中蘇問題，而非國共問題，當更爲國人所公認。故國軍之接收東北，乃應盡之責任，自不應再受任何阻撓，乃散在東北各地之非法部隊，不但阻止國軍之推進，且向國軍已接收之省縣不斷進攻，破壞交通，擾害治安，種種不法，令人髮指！緊以人民軍隊自許之中共軍，當不能出此破壞統一危害和平之行動，乃最近中共當局，妄稱東北國軍擴張內戰，進攻民主聯軍，致提請停止衝突命令延展至東北，增派執行小組調停衝突，此種措施，顯與中共發言人聲明之東北無共軍及國軍開入東北，不受任何限制之協議相矛盾。况政治協商會議之結果，已議決東北除外，整軍方案中所承認共軍在東北之一個軍，乃屬另一問題。現在絕不能援引此規定，以割據東北，故東北之情勢，祗能認爲非法武裝之阻撓接收，而無所謂國共衝突，則執行小組之來東北，不但毫無必要，且無異默認共軍在東北之合法地位，誠令人百思而不解。吾等東北黎庶，淪陷最久，痛苦亦至深，此次勝利光復，惟有企求國家統一，主權完整，故莫不渴望國軍早日順利接收，以資重覩天日，若再任非法部隊之阻撓，執行小組之調處，則東北幾全部爲非法部隊所佔有，縱令徐圖政治解決，東北恐終不免特殊化，而抗戰勝利亦將全部抹殺。政府雖體念東北同胞，慘遭蹂躪，不惜作任何容讓，以期早日恢復和平，然姑息一時，貽患久遠，與其冀和平而不可得，則不如以犧牲爭取和平。故東北同胞，對執行小組之來東北，惟有堅決反對，敢請立即中止派遣，迅以國軍武力進行接收，則國家幸甚，民族幸甚，臨電迫切，諸祈鑒察！遼寗省綏中縣臨時參議會，農會，商會，敎育會，婦女會，學生會仝叩。（卯冬申電）</p>
<p>（二）</p>
<p>我們在日偽奴役統制下過了十四年苦難的日子，我們無時無刻不在祈求解放，祈求重返祖國的懷抱，重覩祖國的威儀。日偽終於倒敗投降了，我們應可重見天日。但是蘇軍久駐不撤，土匪藉以橫行，我們的生命財產與自由一切都失其保障，我們仍然陷在水深火熱之中，過着人間地獄的生活。</p>
<p>所幸蘇軍漸次撤離，國軍漸次進駐，凡國軍所到之處，均成光明燭照之地，匪徒絕跡，民生安定，但是今天柬北大部農村及僻遠縣份，因國軍尙未到達，還是萑苻肆虐，民不聊生，春耕時期已到，農民方苦於流離，最近蘇軍即將遵的完全撤出，我們鑒於目前局勢的迫切和複雜，爰基於股殷　治的心情，提出如下的呼籲：</p>
<p>第一，我們要求國軍迅速大量進駐東北各地，以保障人民的生命財產與自由。</p>
<p>第二，我們要求國軍迅速進駐蘇軍撤退之任何地點，制止土匪之魚肉人民，擾亂治安。</p>
<p>第三，我們要求國軍迅速淸剿土匪，以安定社會秩序，繁榮人民生活。</p>
<p>以上三點要求，不僅是我瀋二百萬民衆，更該是我東北三千萬同胞所衷心一致馨香祝禱早日實現的願望。我們認爲國軍能得早一日進駐，則民衆的痛苦就能得早一日解除，如果蘇軍在四月底前撤退完畢，我們國軍不能及時大量進駐，則四月以後，即將爲我東北人民重罹浩刧之時。現在我們面臨自己生死存亡的關頭，特此提出如上的緊急呼籲，我們請求蔣主席，國民政府給我們以迅速而有效果的拯救，我們希望全國以及全世界的公正人士，給我們以同情偉大的援助。</p>

<h3>慚愧</h3>
<p>— 小山</p>
<p>愧兩個字，在心理學上的解釋是十分錯綜而微妙的。據　　敎授的說法，「慚愧」與「反應」是出於同一字格的；牠是一個代表字，代表單數或多數潛在的愆咎。及罪惡，但道種代表的「發作性」（或說「執行性」）是半被動甚至純被動的。是因着　　種的激動，映射，比較，而波起的，而顯明的。</p>
<p>些說，慚愧就是一個指頭，指到你的黑暗層，你起了某　　應的表現。</p>
<p>這是慚愧的本質。</p>
<p>們再看慚愧的演出：</p>
<p>知道，在漢字的結構和使用上，「慚」和「愧」是不一樣　　　是「表」，愧是「裏」。</p>
<p>說到拆穿一點，在臉上演出的，叫「慚」，在心裏演出的叫的，叫「愧」。臉上熱辣辣，紅緋緋的一陣，這是慚！心裏卜卜跳，亂轟轟的一幌，這是愧！也就是說，面孔上起顏色的叫做慚，心坎裏打官司的叫做愧。</p>
<p>依照正常的心理狀態，一個有罪惡素質，有犯罪紀錄的人，　　該自知自覺的，用不着一定做什麼「反應法」。即使感覺遲　一點的，只要聽得一句諷刺的話，臉上就該起作用了。再不然，直接給你一個「質問」，「揭發」，那麼，良心總該開口了？</p>
<p>或者，更進一步來個反面的：奉承你幾句，拍你幾下，看你　上發不發熱！索性給你一個獎狀，看你心裏受不受得住？</p>
<p>問題就在這裏：好像心理正常的人全已「壽終正寢」？活着　，都是心理衛生家口中的「精神病患者——心理極端變態者」　根本沒有慚愧的本質和機能，叫他何來慚愧的演出？</p>
<p>任憑你說我要錢也罷，枉法也罷，違反民意也罷，我們是一　　　肉臉，一顆歪角心！</p>
<p>馬的來吧，捧塲的來吧，高帽子來吧，當之不慚，受之無</p>
<p>此你只看見那麽多「哈哈哈！」聽不到些微「泣泣」。「厚」，「黑」，上塲，慚愧只得破產！</p>
<p>人生</p>
<h3>為了生活</h3>
<p>— 聰雋</p>
<p>「為了生活」，有許多人藉　句話的掩飾，做了荒淫無恥的勾當。「爲了生活」，也有許多人，由此激勵了他們生活的向上　　完成莊嚴神聖的工作。</p>
<p>格　甫在一篇小說裏，寫了兩個不同性格的人，都可說是「為了生活」的。一個因爲要解　生活問題，便自甘墮落，彷徨於歧途。一個也因爲要解決生活問題，由「生」之意念的激動，而堅決地負擔起爲人類爭取生存的責任。兩個人物，恰巧做了一個對比。</p>
<p>在現在的社會中，意志薄弱的人，尤其是純潔的靑年男女，實在經不起社會的濁浪所冲擊，不少的年靑的人因爲滿足求生的欲望，不自主地被捲入洶湧的濁浪裏去，從此流入墮落的漩渦。爲了生活，誰都能原諒他們，因爲求生是人類最大的欲望。然而也止是爲了生活，誰都不能原諒他們，因爲求生的途徑很多，決不能毫無選擇的隨彼逐流，甘於墜洛。</p>
<p>有人說，操賣笑生涯的妓女，是出汰他們的肉體來換取生活的給養的。我說：那些不擇手段、　「爲了生活」這句冠冕堂皇　點，沈　於社會黑暗面的人，是出賣他們的靈魂，來換取生活的給養的。許多賣身求榮的漢奸，所以甘心爲虎作倀，置民族　家於不顧，他們附逆的動機，　　也是「為了生活」的。當然，　够維持最低限度的生活的人，為了希冀得到更高的物質享受而失足的亦不在少數。然而他們何嘗想到「為了生活」，可走的路正多，爲什麽要通敵？爲什麽要為　寇所利用？「爲了生活」這句話，無論怎樣是不能掩飾他　的罪行的。求生很重要，然而保持一個高尙的理想和人格更重要。如果一個人失却他們的生活理想，或者他們的人格喪失了，即使他仍舊活在世上，也只能算是行屍走肉，是沒有靈魂的。</p>
<p>大思想家羅曼羅蘭說：「我們爲什麼要活在世上？我們的生活不是爲了自己，而是爲了人類」。人類求生欲望的堅强，正說明個體對於社會應該負擔一重責任——爲別人的生存而犧牲自己的幸福。個體是遲早要死亡的，而整個的人類則無限止地綿延下去。我們要使人類社會繼續不斷的進化，使社會生命不隨個體而滅亡，就必須把「小我」化爲「大我」，把個人的智慧，才能，精力統統貢獻給社會，培育「大我」的生長與發展。生活的意義，在增進人類全體的生活，生命的價値在延續人類全體的生命，絕對不是僅僅爲了自己衣食住行問題的解決而活在世上的。</p>
<p>「為了生活」，我們不得不工作，這是很對的。但有點我們必須要先考慮一下：我要生活，別人也是要生活的。爲了自己的生活，是不是影響到別人的生活？爲了自巴的利益，是不是妨礙到別人的利益？個體是生活在羣體中的，個體的發展必須顧到羣體。眞能認識生活的意義的人，不但他們不違害他人的利益，甚至爲了別人的幸福而犧牲自己的利益。他們由於「爲了生活」這句話的激發，自己首先忍受種種生活上的磨折和苦難，與人生搏鬥，時時刻刻在提高他們生活的自覺，同「爲了生活」同時想起的是「爲了人類」。</p>
<p>「爲了生活」我們不　生，也不貪生。相反的，我們還要重視生命的價値，然而我們如果要爲了人類的幸福而必得犧牲一己的生命，我們也不貪生。要我們的人格蒙上垢汚而生，那寗願爲保持人格而死。恥辱的生，不如光榮的死。苟安而生，不如奮鬥而死。</p>
<p>還有，社會有不少人，因爲缺乏良好的生活的素養，便一味只顧滿足求生的欲望，而忽略了最高尙的生活理想。有些人的墮落，乃是由於他們生活享受的標準一時不能降低，以致心有所蔽而行有所虧，佔有慾驅使人們向墮落路上走的力量確很大。一般人的生活，都是屬於感覺的，惟聲色香味是趨，缺乏意志的成分。古今中外特立獨行的人，他們以百屈不撓的精神，堅靱不拔的意志，面向現實社會。失敗艱阻不足動搖他們的心志。他們始終用他們對於生活的信念，去貫澈他們的主張。結果他們是成功了，在人生戰勝上獲得最後勝利。</p>
<p>「為了生活」，我們應該培養生活的信念，過自的生活。我們一方面固然要充實應用的知識與技能，使我們具備適應生活的各種能力，一方面更須認清生活的最大的意義，理解個體與羣體的關係，在堅苦的磨鍊，完成自我敎育的任務，發揮生活的最高的理想。</p>
<p>在强烈的求生欲望的驅迫之下，我們可以走許多路。然而警覺着，別讓我們「爲了生活」的需要，要使人格蒙受些許瑕疵。</p>
<p>「為了生活」，我們要選擇一條政路！</p>

<h3>松江在泥濘淤滑中</h3>
<p>— 陳勉余</p>
<p>假使你是個外地人，在這幾天踏進松江第一個給你的印象將是：路上的泥濘淤滑的局面。路是黃土築成的，雨天裏一踏就成了泥漿，而且因了凹凸不平就特多水窪，偶而有輛卡車駛過，那麽你得設法避一下，吾則利箭般的泥水可射滿你外衣。因此在雨天大家就老是咒咀這路，可是在天放晴後大家又把這件事丢在腦後了。其實晴天這路也是有弊病的，尤其是夏季氣候特燥，寒冬西北風特大的時候，有時你就會疑惑此身是處在大霧裏。黃黃的塵土是那麽多，路上休想把眼舒舒服服的睜開，不讓沙子吹進也是怪。</p>
<p>其次就是飲料，洗滌……一切都靠着河流，水是永遠黃黃的，菜皮，洋瓶，破布簡直可以來一個展覽會。尤其是在潮退後，彷彿陰溝模樣的一條汩汨流着的黑水，我不撒謊，有時就眞有股令人作嘔的臭氣。</p>
<p>近來有人發起浚河，這似乎給人們眼前亮一亮，每家商店每人四千元的浚河費收得也差不多了，接着這口號也就逐漸隱淡下去。轉眼炎夏將届，我眞在替松江人担心，大熱天疫癘橫生的時候，混濁汚穢的河水，對於身體健康將有怎樣的一種威脅。在現在還不迅速動工。</p>
<p>和着河流差不多陋窳的就算松江的市房了，從西門口到馬路橋，以最繁盛的一段說，也沒整齊可言。在這裏可以看到三層的高樓，但也尋得到突出了屋簷，露出和尙頭般光屋頂的低平房，特多的就是屛風式的洋式假門面，高高低低統把簡陋掩飾着，可是在起火風時就有了危險性。</p>
<p>因此有人說：道路，河流，房屋是松江陋窳的三部曲，這確有其實在性。</p>
<p>談到松江的營業區，祗在西門外短短一段。城內在抗戰時給敵人炸得僅是一些頽壁殘垣了，到現在仍是老樣子，祇有寥寥一些住宅，和幾個機關在勉凑熱閙。所以說松江實在祗是西門外一段，而西門外也僅祗馬路橋到西門口較為熱閙，眞是精華。</p>
<p>但市區却頗遼闊，從東至西也有三四里。因此人力車在這條件下也有了它的地位，至少在還沒有足以較它簡捷便利的交通工具代替前，它是不會受淘汰的。不過此地的人力車決沒有像我們想像的那樣整齊，車身非但左搖右晃，就是車輪上也累累贅贅包了一大堆一大堆破繩碎布，給你的視覺也是不舒服。較為入目的不到十分之一。</p>
<p>就是電燈在松江也不大令人滿意，燈光低弱，時常出毛病固是事實，碰着燃煤吿罄也得臨時來一下電影院內的『休息五分鐘』。通常煤油燈，菜油燈都作為後備，否則免不了吃虧。</p>
<p>比較上敎育是還熱閙，早上，傍晚，路上走的學生就特別多，可是這也僅限在一個階層裏，普通商人知識水準就很低。在這裏最完備的書店都是「春殘夢斷」「三門街」之類，雖然也有幾册「子夜」之類在凑數。</p>
<p>一個書店職員吿訴我說：以前的××詩刋，在松江每期祗有三四册銷路。說出來是多麼可憐呵！也難怪書櫉是成了過去小報作風的××周刋××周刋的世界了。</p>
<p>現在本地有茸報，靑年日報，大光明日報三種，都是托印刷所代印，但退化了的副刋，偏狹的新聞網也沒什麽顯著的收獲。其中還是靑年日報算是較可觀的一張。餘外僅有一份靑年月報支撑着松江的文壇，但質量薄，祇有四開一張，印數也不多，而且也沒明顯的風格。本來還有大同小異的：職業青年，女靑年兩種刊物，就在最近爲了紙價在漲，印刷費高昂二個致命傷下而吿夭折了。</p>
<p>所謂文壇也像這裏雨天裏的路，陷在泥濘淤滑裏。其實松江那一處不泥濘，不淤滑，勝利半年了一切都是依舊，睜開眼那一處不滯留在泥濘淤滑裏。</p>

<h3>鈔票滿地飛</h3>
<p>— 金丁</p>
<p>在馬路上，時常看見小額的法幣，和票面五千或一萬的偽幣，任人踐踏着，連「　三」們也置之不理，「鈔票江地飛」，誰說民不聊生？哀鴻遍野？</p>
<p>在鄕鎭的街頭巷尾，我們也時常可以看見同樣的情形，有的把五元十元的CRB，當作草紙用；或者當作糊壁的裝飾品；「鈔票滿地飛」，誰說農村破產需要救濟？</p>
<p>到處表現着「鈔票滿地飛」的景象路不拾遺歟？君子國歟？</p>

<h3>Chen Cheng and Zhou Enlai Discuss Ceasefire; Many Difficulties Arise in Northeast Mediation; Group Traveling to Siping Returns Midway</h3>
<p>[Our Beiping Correspondent, 8th] It has been reliably confirmed by our correspondent that the Military Three-Person Committee in Chongqing has not reached an agreement on a detailed plan to resolve the Northeast issue.</p>
<p>[United Press, Chongqing, 8th] Prior to today's meeting of the Three-Person Committee to discuss developments in the Northeast situation, Lieutenant General Gillem conferred with Chairman Chiang. Zhou Enlai met with General Chen Cheng yesterday to discuss ceasefire issues. Reports suggest the Three-Person Committee is stalled, but other sources believe that after the Executive Headquarters establishes a foundation for a ceasefire in the Northeast, the Three-Person Committee may form another agreement and travel to the Northeast themselves. Meanwhile, much of the work to halt the civil war has fallen on the shoulders of General Beall, director of the Executive Group of the Executive Headquarters.</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Correspondent, 8th] According to official sources, a central group in Shenyang is sufficient to command other groups, making it unnecessary to establish an executive branch.</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Correspondent, 8th] Today, Executive Group No. 28 traveled north along the Changchun Railway to the Sipingjie area, while Group No. 29 traveled south to the Benxi area. However, whether they can be effective remains unknown, as the discrepancies in opinions among the three parties are significant, and numerous difficulties stand in the way of mediation efforts. Issues such as restoring transportation, which is linked to the ceasefire, the takeover of areas from which Soviet troops are about to withdraw, and the transfer of local political power are extremely difficult to resolve. Unless these issues are thoroughly resolved, the groups will be unable to effectively carry out mediation work. Therefore, although the groups have departed in different directions today, their work is still in the symbolic and preparatory stages.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Shenyang, 8th] Two groups from the Military Mediation Executive Headquarters set out this morning to the northern and southeastern parts of the Nine Eastern Provinces to investigate the deployment of troops. Each group is equipped with six to eight trucks and jeeps, fitted with radios. The group heading north includes representatives from the Kuomintang, the Communist Party, and the United States, as well as several journalists, led by Colonel Collier. The group heading southeast is led by Lieutenant Colonel Thiele.</p>
<p>[United Press, Shenyang, 8th] The executive group heading to the Fushun coal mining area is proceeding smoothly and has not encountered any incidents. Another group dispatched to Sipingjie was obstructed by a bombed bridge (twelve miles north of Shenyang) and returned to Pan [Shenyang] this afternoon. According to the group leader, Colonel Collier, while the group was stranded on the side of the road discussing how to cross the river, Nationalist soldiers came out and warned that there were armed Communists ahead who might carry out a surprise attack, and that it would be dangerous to proceed. However, the Communist representative of the group, Major General Kong Biao, assured the other members of the group that the Communist army would not cause trouble. At the time, the Nationalist representative, Lieutenant General Wang Zhaogong (transliteration), suggested that it would be a good idea to establish a guard before continuing forward. Collier insisted that they must continue to carry out their mission and cross the river if possible, but it proved impossible, and the group returned to Pan[yang]. After returning here at half past two this afternoon, the group immediately began preparing all matters for departing by train on the 9th.</p>
<p>[Another dispatch] The chief of staff of the Northeast Communist Army Commander Lin Biao, Major General Wu Xiuguan, suggested during his first reception of reporters today that Nationalist and Communist troops should jointly take over areas withdrawn by Soviet troops, believing that this is the most appropriate way to stop the war in the Northeast. He also stated: "The time is not yet ripe for General Lin Biao to come to Shenyang. In fact, it is more likely that General Lin Biao will meet with General Beall or other American representatives at his Communist headquarters in his command area."</p>
<h3>Soviet Troops Withdraw on Three Fronts; Dong Yanping Flies Back to Changchun from Shenyang Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Our Beiping Correspondent, 8th] The speed of the Nationalist troops departing from Shenyang to take over areas withdrawn by Soviet troops has exceeded what has already been announced in newspapers, but recently, due to melting ice and snow, muddy roads, and the increased obstruction by Communist troops, the speed of advancement has slowed down.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Harbin, 8th] Soviet troops here are currently withdrawing in three directions: north to Heihe, east to Suifenhe, and west to Manzhouli. It is reported that Soviet troops will completely withdraw from Harbin before April 26th.</p>
<p>[Another dispatch] Today, another 3,000 Communist troops left Shuangcheng County and moved into Banlachengzi, west of the city. The situation in Harbin is becoming increasingly serious, but so far, no incidents have occurred in the city. Mayor Yang Chaoan is calmly dealing with everything. Yesterday, he met with the person in charge of the Communist army, and both sides expressed their determination to resolve all issues peacefully in accordance with government instructions.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Changchun, 8th] Dong Yanping flew back here from Shenyang at noon on the 8th, accompanied by representatives from the Mongolian banners of Xing'an Province, Ma Mingzhou, Chen Tingrui, and Han Yuru, as well as their staff.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Beiping, 8th] Du Yuming, Commander of the Northeast Security Headquarters, has been in good spirits recently. He has had two examinations by doctors since being discharged from the hospital. It is said that although he has recovered, he still needs to rest. However, it is heard that Mr. Du believes that Northeast military affairs are important and will fly to Shenyang by special plane in ten days.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Changchun, 8th] The defense of Changchun is gradually being consolidated, and all streets are filled with obstacles, which can be sealed off at any time in the event of an emergency. The restless elements who used to strut around have recently disappeared, which greatly increases the sense of security among the general public. Some sensitive military personnel believe that with the defense of Changchun becoming increasingly solid, it is unlikely to be attacked. Even if there is a disturbance, it can be quickly subdued. Their most powerful argument is that the city has been peaceful for the past five days, and the public has been safe, which proves that those seeking an opportunity have become wary. However, the views of some political figures are the opposite. They believe that the current peace and quiet is the calm before the storm. Changchun is the political hub of the Northeast, and the Communist army will never let it go.</p>
<p>[Another dispatch] Amidst the Soviet troop withdrawal, the city's security team and police have launched a citywide inspection, with sentries densely deployed in the streets and alleys. Suspicious vehicles, horses, and pedestrians are also inspected. On the 7th alone, multiple boxes of handgun bullets, multiple mortar shells, and machine gun bullets were seized.</p>
<h3>Protecting the Property of Soviet Nationals; We Are Determined to Fulfill Our Responsibilities</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Changchun, 8th] During his last meeting with Soviet Army Chief of Staff Trotsenko, Dong Yanping, Mr. Trotsenko mentioned the issue of protecting Soviet nationals and their property after the Soviet troops withdraw from Changchun. It is said that Marshal Malinovsky's political advisor will soon provide a list of Soviet nationals and an inventory of their property to our side, hoping that we will protect them. At that time, Mr. Dong replied that he would fulfill his responsibilities, but stated that he could not predict whether Changchun would fall into a state of war in the future. Before the Nationalist takeover forces arrive, Changchun's security forces are very weak, and there may be inadequate protection. Mr. Trotsenko said that he currently does not have sufficient information to judge what kind of state Changchun will be in, but if war breaks out, accidental losses cannot be demanded from China. However, he said that what he requires is that the Chinese government not harm Soviet nationals and their property, as in the case of Shenyang. Mr. Dong said that he is absolutely responsible for this, but for the sake of protection, Soviet property will be surrounded by barbed wire, as was done in Shenyang, and if necessary, Soviet nationals will be concentrated in one place. Mr. Trotsenko accepted this. Finally, Mr. Dong reviewed the inventory of property sent by the Soviet side and expressed doubts about its ownership. He has notified the Soviet side, reiterating his intention to be responsible for protection, but declaring that he would reserve the right to all items of property.</p>
<h3>Chairman Chiang Kai-shek Summons Councillors from Chongqing</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 8th] At 10:00 AM today, Chairman Chiang summoned all city councillors of Chongqing at the National Government Auditorium and gave a speech, saying that the government and the people of the wartime capital have shared joys and sorrows for eight years, making great contributions to the War of Resistance. Now that the government is about to return to Nanjing, he would like to entrust the city councillors with two matters: (1) the welfare of the people and (2) local security, hoping that they will continue to shoulder this important task. The Chairman also took a group photo with all city councillors to commemorate the occasion.</p>
<h3>Chairman of Zhejiang Province, Shen Honglie, to Take Office in Hangzhou Tomorrow</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Hangzhou, 8th] Chairman of Zhejiang Province, Shen Honglie, will come to Hangzhou from Shanghai on the 10th and is scheduled to take office on the 11th.

<h3>National Conference of Business Groups Scheduled to be Held in Beijing on the 28th of This Month</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 8th] The first national conference of business groups to be convened after the victory is scheduled to be held in Beijing on the 28th of this month. The conference is convened by the Ministry of Social Affairs, but because commercial groups in the recovered provinces and cities are still in the process of being reorganized, the conference is temporarily named "National Chamber of Commerce Friendship Association." It is heard that chambers of commerce from all provinces and cities across the country will send representatives to attend, and chambers of commerce from the Northeast provinces and cities have also received notices and will enthusiastically participate if there are no transportation problems. The quota of representatives is more than 100 people, and registration will begin on the 20th of this month. The nature of the conference is to promote emotional ties and exchange opinions, but relevant government departments also want to take this opportunity to listen to the opinions of commercial leaders from various places on post-war business development for reference. Minister of Social Affairs Gu Zhenggang and others will participate at that time.</p>
<h3>Zhang Zhizhong Takes Office; Optimism Regarding the Yining Issue</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Dihua, 7th] Concurrently Chairman Zhang Zhizhong first took office on the 8th. He announced to the personnel of the former provincial departments that all heads of departments and offices would temporarily retain their positions, with only the position of Secretary-General of the Provincial Government being temporarily replaced by Liu Mengchun, Secretary-General of the Field Headquarters.</p>
<p>[Another dispatch] According to well-informed sources, an agreement on the Yining issue is expected to be reached within the week. The atmosphere here has been quite optimistic recently.</p>
<h3>Wedemeyer Arrives in San Francisco; Reportedly to Be Appointed U.S. Ambassador After Returning to China</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, San Francisco, 7th] General Wedemeyer arrived at Hamilton Airfield today by plane and is on his way to Omaha, Nebraska, for minor surgery. He told reporters that he would visit Washington before returning to China.</p>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 8th] Senior Chinese government officials expect Lieutenant General Wedemeyer to return to China in about three months to serve as the U.S. Ambassador to China. They say that Wedemeyer will hold meetings with various parties in Washington during his vacation.

After the sentence was pronounced, the court instructed that if he disagreed, he could apply for an appeal within ten days.

The High Court here has now completed its investigation, filed a public prosecution, and the opening date of the trial will be announced soon.</p>
<h3>National Military Grand Review; The Military Training Department Revised the Plan and Submitted It for Approval</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 8th] According to Major General Wei Heling, Deputy Director of the General Affairs Department of the Military Training Department, the military demobilization conference held in February of this year decided to hold a national military grand review on a regular basis. This resolution has now been revised by the Military Training Department, and after being submitted to the highest authorities for approval, officers with reviewing experience will be assembled and undergo rigorous training. This training has already begun. The review will be divided into the Southeast Region, Southwest Region, Central China Region, South China Region, Northeast Region, Northwest Region, and Taiwan Region, and a chief reviewing committee member will be established. The selection of personnel will await the decision of the highest authorities. The review period will be approximately two weeks, and the period is scheduled for around June. In addition, during the eight years of the War of Resistance, our army fought the enemy extremely fiercely. In order to make the people of the rear and people from all walks of life understand the heroic battles of the National Army, a large-scale land and air exercise is planned to be held when the National Assembly convenes. The exercise subjects are (1) an attack on the enemy's solid defenses (formed by artillery, air, transportation, and various arms of service), (2) night-time village defense (airborne supply), (3) battlefield psychological exercise, (4) camouflage and concealment exercise. The location is selected outside Cangbomen in this city, and the 74th Army stationed in this city will be the base unit for the exercise troops, and other elite troops will be dispatched, and the air force will participate. The uniforms for the exercise of the underground troops will all be newly made to ensure uniformity, so as to receive the representatives of the National Assembly. It is also learned that the 74th Army Headquarters is preparing for the exercise, and Qiu Weida's division of the army has begun various preparations and there will be exciting performances when the time comes.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 8th] It is heard that the Nanjing Army Headquarters will be closed in the short term, perhaps by the end of the month. Tang Enbo came to Beijing today to visit Commander-in-Chief He to report on his duties.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Nanjing, 8th] According to reports, people close to the National Government say that the National Government proposes He Yingqin or Zhang Qun to be appointed as Minister of National Defense, while the Central Government proposes Li Jishen and Zhang Zhizhong.</p>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 8th] Senior authoritative sources say that President Chiang is currently considering the approval of the entire reorganization plan for the Supreme Command of the Army, Navy, and Air Force, as proposed by Lieutenant General Wedemeyer and Brigadier General McAuliffe. Wedemeyer and McAuliffe claim that the plan aims to merge the many existing military organizations and their redundant branches into two main institutions: (1) the General Staff Headquarters, and (2) the Ministry of National Defense. The plan is modeled after the American system but is even simpler. China's future General Staff Headquarters will include all air force, army, navy, and supply affairs, just like the U.S. Department of the Army. China's future Ministry of National Defense will only become a department in the cabinet that liaisons with the military. The wartime supreme military organization, the Military Affairs Commission, is not involved in the plan proposed by Wedemeyer and McAuliffe. The current Aviation Commission will become an Air Force Command under the future General Staff Headquarters. Once the reorganization plan is approved by President Chiang, it will be implemented immediately. The new plan advocates the abolition of the existing redundant military organizations, including the Military Affairs Commission, the Department of Military Operations, the Military Training Department, the Political Department, the General Logistics Headquarters, the Ministry of Military Administration, and the Aviation Commission.</p>
<h3>Jinan Group Reaches Agreement to Establish a Materials Exchange Committee</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Jinan, 8th] The Jinan Group held a meeting at 5:00 PM on the 6th to discuss the issue of material exchange between the two sides. It was immediately decided to establish a Material Exchange Committee in Jinan, and the two sides reached the following agreement: Regarding the issue of food, fuel, and other materials, for the purpose of urban-rural material exchange, it was agreed that each side would send personnel to Jinan to purchase materials.

(4) Each side will designate one committee member to be fully responsible for the organization and coordination. Under each committee member, several sections will be established as needed to handle the business and various offices. (5) For items needed by the government, the CCP representative will handle the purchase; for items needed by the CCP, the government representative will handle the purchase. For general materials, they can be purchased independently. (6) Other matters regarding price and currency conversion shall be resolved fairly and reasonably.

Government representative Xu Xuwu, American representative Lake (Nap substitute), CCP representative Kuang Rengnong, April 6, Year 35 of the Republic of China, in Jinan.</p>
<p>Request Instructions to Stop Conflicts</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Jinan, 6th] The Jinan Group has recently heard of frequent conflicts occurring in various places and has issued the following telegram, requesting Commander Wang Yaowu and Commander Chen Yi of the CCP's New Fourth Army to investigate and report back for handling. The original telegram is as follows: Order He Zi No. 6 has been promulgated and urgently needs to be implemented. However, it is reported that small-scale conflicts, troop movements, intensified fortifications, and arrests of personnel are still occurring in various places. This seems to affect the implementation of the order. However, without investigation by the group, it is difficult to determine right and wrong. We hereby telegram you, Commander and Commander, to immediately and strictly order your subordinates to immediately cease conflicts, cease construction of fortifications, cease blockade policies, and cease arresting personnel. If troop movements are due to troop rotation or transportation, they must also be approved by the Executive Headquarters or the Executive Group before implementation, pending the implementation of Order He Zi No. 6. If any of the above-mentioned events are found to be true after investigation, they will be reported to the Executive Headquarters as a violation of the truce agreement. We respectfully request that you investigate and handle accordingly. Jinan Group Government representative Tu Xuwu, American representative Colonel Lake (Lieutenant Colonel Nap substitute), CCP representative Kuang Rengnong, 6th.</p>
<p>Agreement Signed to Implement Order</p>
<p>[Another Telegram] (Delayed) The representatives of the Jinan Group held an informal meeting with the military and political authorities here on the morning of the 6th and exchanged views on various urgent issues to be resolved. At 2:30 PM, the three representatives of the Jinan Group held a formal meeting and signed the following agreement regarding the implementation of Order He Zi No. 6: (1) Both parties agree that Attachments (1) and (2) of Order He Yu No. 6 should be immediately communicated to the senior commanders of both sides, and the relevant materials should be prepared promptly and sent to the group as soon as possible for processing. At the same time, the group will go to various regions in advance to implement the order according to the order. (2) Both parties agree that the group's actions will proceed in the order of Eastern Shandong, Western Shandong, Southern Shandong, and Northern Shandong, to various regions for implementation. Regarding the Liaocheng issue, both parties should immediately notify the local military commanders that they must not further increase the difficulty of resolving the issue. (3) Both parties agree that before the group arrives in a certain area, both parties should notify the local garrison commander to prepare relevant matters so that the group can immediately proceed with the resolution upon arrival. Government representative Tu Xuwu, American representative Colonel Lake (Lieutenant Colonel Nap substitute), CCP representative Kuang Rengnong, April 6, Year 35.</p>
<p>Road Repair and Postal Service Still Unresolved</p>
<p>[Our newspaper, Beiping, 8th] The work of repairing railways in North China has almost come to a standstill due to the CCP's insistence on dismantling bunkers. CCP personnel believe that dismantling bunkers is as important as restoring traffic, and they refuse to repair the roads unless the bunkers are dismantled. The Military Mediation Department is holding daily meetings on this issue but has not yet reached a resolution. Currently, the gap from Qinglongqiao to Huailai on the Ping-Sui Railway is still being blocked by the CCP, and the Jinpu and Jiaoji Railways are also at a standstill. Although the Pinghan Railway can be repaired from Yuanshi to Gaoyi, the issue of repairing south of Gaoyi has not yet been agreed upon. Regarding the issue of restoring the normal state of postal services, the responsible personnel of both the government and the CCP have been in contact here. The CCP insists that all postal personnel in the CCP-controlled areas should be hired by the Ministry, while the government believes that the national postal service is unified, and all personnel should undergo screening, with no exceptions for postal personnel in the CCP-controlled areas. This issue has also not been resolved.</p>
<p>Communist Army Continues to Attack the Tangshan Area</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tianjin, 7th] The Communist army's attacks on the area east of Tangshan have not stopped. In addition, more than 3,000 Communist troops have invaded the vicinity of Lutai, threatening to attack Lutai.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Taiyuan, 7th] Government representative Zhang Xiqin, who went to Zhongyang to inspect the situation a few days ago, immediately proceeded to implement Orders He Zi No. 2 and No. 6 after arriving in Zhongyang, and negotiated solutions for lifting the siege and withdrawal. Zhang has returned to his defense area. The two sides are holding frequent meetings and have reached many agreements on various issues and are still continuing discussions.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Gui Sui, 7th] A division of the Communist army has recently moved from Ji-Cha-Re area to the vicinity of Gaoyang in northern Shanxi. The original regiment in Gaoyang has increased its presence to the area east of Datong, including Julebao, Thirty Mile Shop, and Twenty Mile Shop, intensifying the encirclement of Datong. Recently, the Communist army has been actively constructing fortifications along the line from Fushengzhuang Tianyu in eastern Suiyuan to Sutai, as well as along the line from Dongximengou to Chenjiayingzi.</p>
<h3>National Assembly Meeting Unlikely to Be Postponed; Legislative Yuan to Discuss National Assembly Organization Law Tomorrow; Executive Yuan Regular Meeting to Move to Nanjing After the 16th</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper, Nanjing, 8th] There are widespread rumors in Nanjing and Chongqing that the "First National Assembly of Representatives," originally scheduled to be held on "May 5th," may be postponed to July 7th. However, according to those who came to Nanjing from Chongqing today, the current transportation difficulties are not the main reason for the postponement of the National Assembly. The people of the country now deeply understand the government's determination to implement Dr. Sun Yat-sen's proposal to convene a National Assembly and hope to convene the National Assembly after the realization of unity and unification. If there is a postponement, the main reason should be here.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 8th] The regular meeting of the Legislative Yuan is scheduled to be held at 10:00 AM on the 10th in the National Government Auditorium. At that time, the National Assembly Organization Law will be discussed.</p>
<p>[Another Telegram] All agencies are currently handling the return to the capital. The regular meeting of the Executive Yuan will still be held in Chongqing twice, and then it will be moved to Nanjing after the 16th. The Yuan is currently discussing the salaries of the personnel returning to the capital. Starting from April, they will be paid according to the Nanjing standard. The family members of the officials returning to the capital who remain in Chongqing will receive a monthly face allowance of 10,000 yuan each for May and June.</p>
<p>[Another Telegram] This month's personnel returning to the capital are particularly crowded. In terms of air transport, in addition to the transportation of representatives of the National Assembly and senators to Nanjing, which is about 1,000 people, a total of 4,200 personnel from the central party and government agencies are returning to the capital, and they will fly to Nanjing successively starting from the 10th. The allocation of seats is as follows: 500 from the Central Party Headquarters, 100 from the Supreme National Defense Council, 280 from the National Government Secretariat and Accounting Office, 120 from the National Government Military Affairs Office, 200 from the Youth Corps, 600 from the Legislative Yuan, 120 from the Judicial Yuan, 250 from the Examination Yuan, 120 from the Control Yuan, and 1,700 from the Secretariat of the Executive Yuan and its subordinate agencies, including the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Economic Affairs, Ministry of Transportation, Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, and Ministry of Food. 200 are from diplomatic missions. The rest of the ordinary personnel returning to the capital will inevitably be slightly restricted. Due to the lack of housing in Nanjing, only 50 mobile houses have been transported. Each agency will take care of its own office space in Nanjing, and the family members of the officials will remain in Chongqing for the time being. If they need to go to Nanjing first, their housing problems should be handled first.</p>
<h3>Vice Minister Xu Arrives in Nanjing to Preside Over the Return to the Capital</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper, Nanjing, 8th] Xu Xiaoyan, Deputy Minister of the Central Propaganda Department, arrived in Nanjing by special plane this afternoon with more than 20 staff members of the department.

The press in Nanjing paid tribute to Deputy Minister Xu for leading the national press community to fight the enemy with paper bullets during the Anti-Japanese War, and the journalists' fellowship repeatedly raised toasts to express their welcome. It is reported that Deputy Minister Xu will be stationed in Nanjing to preside over the department's return to the capital.</p>
<h3>Pinghan Railway Derailment Case: More Than 200 Killed and Injured</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper, Hankou, 7th] Another reason for the derailment of the Pinghan Railway freight train was that the engine parts failed, and the driver did not replace them, resulting in the tragedy. According to a detailed investigation afterward, a total of eleven cars derailed. Out of more than 400 passengers, 200 were killed and more than 50 were injured. Two of them died from their injuries after being taken back by the rescue train.</p>

<h3>Security Council Faces New Difficulties: Soviet Union Makes Another Request; Asks Not to Discuss the Suez Incident Anymore; Britain and the United States Oppose Adding the Spanish Question to the Agenda</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] San Francisco, 8th, broadcast: After the United Nations Security Council decided to postpone the discussion of the Iranian issue to May 6th, it was expected that the matter would come to an end, but new problems have arisen. Three new developments in the past two days are noteworthy: (1) Although the Security Council has decided to postpone the discussion of the Iranian complaint, the Soviet Union is still not satisfied. Soviet representative Gromyko sent another letter to UN Secretary-General Lie yesterday, stating that last week's Security Council resolution was illegal and contrary to the UN Charter. He also said that since Iran and the Soviet Union have reached an agreement, the Soviet Union firmly insists that the Iranian case should be removed from the Security Council's agenda. The current relationship between Iran and the Soviet Union poses no threat to peace and security. (2) The Iranian Prime Minister announced that armed forces are plotting a rebellion in the Maku-Terre province, which has been evacuated by Soviet troops, and the Iranian army has been ordered to immediately go to the area to quell the rebellion. (3) The contents of the Soviet-Iranian Oil Company agreement have been published (see yesterday's newspaper), but today Moscow Radio claimed that the 50-mile-deep corridor along the Iranian-Iraqi-Turkish border does not belong to the jurisdiction of the Soviet-Iranian Oil Company. Personnel and equipment for developing the northern Iranian oil fields are ready and can start work soon.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, New York, 7th] UN Secretary-General Lie said today: I have not yet received the Polish proposal on the Spanish issue. At the same time, the Soviet radio station announced that Soviet Ambassador to the United States Gromyko has sent a letter to the Security Council requesting that the Iranian issue be removed from the agenda. UN personnel here were surprised to hear this and said that, according to custom, any document must be released at least two hours after it is submitted to the Security Council. This action by the Soviet Union is a violation of custom. The announcement of Gromyko's letter and the decision by the Polish representative to raise the Spanish issue to the Security Council occurred at the same time, indicating that the Soviet Union may launch a diplomatic offensive again. It is reported that Security Council Chairman Guo Taiqi has requested that Molomi Ko's letter be translated immediately.</p>
<p>[United Press, New York, 7th] Poland proposed that the Spanish issue be raised for discussion by the United Nations Security Council this week. According to reliable sources today, the United States and Britain are prepared to oppose this proposal. The United States and Britain claimed that Poland accused the Franco government of endangering world peace. Unless it can submit an unexpected emergency report, each government will respond to Poland in the same way as it responded to France last time.</p>
<h3>Structure and Content of the Soviet-Iranian Oil Company</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 8th] Moscow Radio broadcast today the text of the telegrams exchanged between Stalin and Iranian Prime Minister Sadana and the full text of the Soviet-Iranian oil concession agreement (see yesterday's newspaper for Sadana's telegram to Stalin). Stalin's reply telegram stated, I am convinced that the establishment of the Soviet-Iranian agreement will further promote friendly cooperation between the peoples of the two countries. The radio station continued: The Iranian Prime Minister and the Soviet Ambassador to Iran also exchanged letters on the cooperation of the Soviet-Iranian oil industry. The Iranian Prime Minister's letter stated: Our two countries have now concluded negotiations and are proceeding to organize the Soviet-Iranian Gasoline Joint-Stock Company to develop Iranian oil fields. The main points are as follows: (1) In the first 25 years, Iran holds 49% of the company's shares, and the Soviet Union holds 51%. In the next 25 years, each party holds 50%. (2) The company's profits are distributed according to the share ratio. (3) The oil field development area is as designated on the map on March 24 of this year, except for the western part of Azerbaijan Province, that is, the area from the meeting point of the borders of the three countries, Soviet Union, Iran, and Turkey in the west, and the east bank of the Lecai River in the south, is not included. The Iranian government will not allow foreign companies to develop oil fields in this area. (4) Iranian capital, as stipulated in Article 3, is granted oil rights as Iranian investment capital. The Soviet Union's obligations include all expenses, the salaries of experts and workers, and the supply of equipment. (5) The company exists for a period of 50 years. (6) After the expiration, the Iranian government has the right to buy the shares in the hands of the Soviet government. The Iranian security team is fully responsible for defending the various facilities in the area. This agreement to organize the Soviet-Iranian Oil Industry Joint-Stock Company will be submitted for approval after the Iranian parliament has completed its legislative work, and it should be submitted to the parliament within seven months from March 24. The Soviet Ambassador's reply stated that the Soviet government agreed to the points mentioned in the letter and would proceed to organize the company to develop oil fields.</p>

<h3>Clashes Between Japanese Leftists and the Prime Minister Intensify</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Tokyo, 8th, Special Dispatch] Japanese Prime Minister Shidehara met today with representatives of yesterday's protesters, protected by plainclothes personnel with handgun boxes. The representatives demanded that Shidehara respond to the five conditions proposed by the protesters, but Shidehara did not answer at the time. One representative shouted, "Why does the Prime Minister employ armed plainclothes personnel for protection?" and said that this method was extremely undemocratic. At this point, Shidehara walked out of the reception room, but was blocked by the representatives. The plainclothes armed personnel resorted to force and drove the representatives out. The conflict between the Shidehara cabinet and the left-wing parties has become more acute as a result.</p>

"Lattimore emphasized that China has the moral and legal right to become one of the world's powers, but China needs external assistance to join the ranks of the powers. Its potential is indeed stronger than its current strength. The only question is how to maintain a balanced situation so that China can take Japan's place and replace it. The position once held by Japan in the Far East should belong to China."</p>

<h3>Beauties Need Not Panic: When Testing Atomic Bombs, the Explosion is Limited to a Local Area; Experts Issue Statement Again</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 7th] American atomic experts Drs. Taylor and Bethe, serving as consultants for the Pacific atomic bomb tests, declared today to dispel the growing panic in the American psyche: During atomic bomb tests, the explosion is completely limited to a local area. It will neither destroy the world nor evaporate the oceans. This type of explosion will absolutely not cause the seawater to undergo progressive decomposition, thereby causing an atomic explosion of the earth. When an atomic bomb explodes underwater, the temperature of the surrounding seawater is not very high, around one million degrees, while the center of a star reaches two million degrees. Such stars contain elements similar to those in seawater, but without a high-speed chain reaction, they do not explode or self-consume.</p>
<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Refuting the Specious Argument for a Coalition Government</h3>
<p>Chongqing United Press, 7th. General Zhou Enlai warned today that if it is necessary to undertake the work of establishing democracy and rebuilding the country, China's coalition government should exercise its power within six months. In an hour-long meeting with United Press Far East Manager Vaughn, United Press reporter Ravenholt, and Los Angeles Times reporter Treick, Zhou outlined what he considers the most important prerequisites for the recovery of coastal cities and the prosperity within the liberated areas. He insisted that only a united government can overcome "the most serious crisis facing the country today, namely the urgent need for economic stability in China." Zhou Enlai and other CCP figures have consistently emphasized the necessity of a so-called coalition government before foreign journalists, but the so-called coalition government needs to be explained. Using terms without a clear definition not only easily leads to confusion but also invites discrepancy between name and reality.</p>
<p>Abroad, the term coalition government refers to a situation where the original government is overthrown, and no single party has a majority in parliament to independently form a government. It is necessary to unite with other parties with somewhat similar political views to jointly take responsibility and form a government, hence the name coalition government. Another scenario is when a country has just undergone a revolution, and the strengths of various parties are evenly matched, with no single party having the power to independently form a government. It is necessary to join hands with other parties with similar political views to form a so-called coalition government. Therefore, the main premise for the organization of a so-called coalition government is the overthrow of the original regime and its replacement with a new regime. Moreover, this new regime is formed by various parties with largely similar political views that are responsible to the parliament. This is the general form of a so-called coalition government. Furthermore, this form of government is indeed not the norm for democratic constitutionalism.</p>
<p>Since the National Government convened the Political Consultative Conference, it has hoped, under the principle of maintaining domestic peace, that all parties and factions can jointly participate in the central institutions of actual politics, thereby giving the National Government a broader foundation. This is fundamentally different from what is generally referred to as a coalition government in other countries. Because the main aim of the Political Consultative Conference's agreement is to strengthen the National Government, not to weaken or overthrow it. This is very simple. First, the Chinese Kuomintang has been dedicated to the national liberation movement for nearly fifty years. Based on the progress of the revolution, there are three stages: military administration, tutelage, and constitutionalism. Before the War of Resistance, there was an original intention to implement constitutionalism, but it was later suspended due to the war. However, now that the War of Resistance has been won, the government is sticking to its original intention and preparing to implement constitutionalism. Moreover, before the National Assembly has exercised its powers and our country has not yet formally entered the constitutional stage, in order to concentrate national will and increase national strength, it is inviting all parties and factions to participate in the government and jointly assume the responsibility of actual politics, based on the current legal system. Therefore, the participation of various parties and factions in the government at the current stage, before the constitutional era has formally arrived, is still based on the laws of the tutelage period. This is still a government centered on the Kuomintang, but for the sake of objective facts, necessary reorganization and expansion are being carried out based on the existing scale. This fundamentally cannot be called a coalition government. Second, a coalition government takes the overthrow of the original regime as a prerequisite and must be responsible to the people or the people's representative body. Currently, the one responsible to the people should clearly still be the National Government, which is given power by the Provisional Constitution formulated by the National Convention twenty years ago. Therefore, the participation of various parties and factions in the government under the current circumstances is not to overthrow the current regime but to enrich the current regime. This is fundamentally not a form of coalition government. If Zhou Enlai and other CCP figures are still knowingly ignoring this and repeatedly emphasize the organization of a coalition government, whether their intention is to overthrow the current regime and replace it with a new so-called coalition regime, we do not need to speculate. But we want to declare: China does not need the organization of a so-called coalition government. According to the policy of the Chinese Kuomintang and Chairman Chiang's proclamation, we can only allow necessary enrichment of the government under the existing system. And apart from the constitution to be formulated by the future National Assembly, no one person or organization can have the power to cancel or amend the Provisional Constitution, nor can any one person or organization overthrow the legitimate National Government before the future democratically elected government!</p>
<p>We must remember that the Chinese Kuomintang seized power with revolutionary force, and returning power to the people is the ultimate goal of the Kuomintang's rule. When the National Assembly is convened to formulate a constitution, and when the people's power is exercised based on this constitution, that will be the beginning of constitutional governance. Before that, including the current stage, it is still the tutelage period. At this time, first inviting all parties and factions to jointly participate in the government is precisely a manifestation of the Kuomintang's long-held aspiration of "the world belongs to all." As yesterday's editorial in this newspaper said: "Originally, a country's military and political orders should be absolutely unified. Within a country, allowing parties to have armies, and even further recognizing the Communist army as a unit, and carrying out mediation between the Communist army and the government army, from the standpoint of strict military discipline, is already a ridiculous joke." Similarly, constitutional governance has not yet formally begun, a formal representative body of the people has not yet been established, and it is not yet known whether the people want to elect another party other than the Kuomintang to govern. At this juncture, the National Government first automatically invites all parties and factions to participate in the government. From the standpoint of a serious national revolution, this is also already a ridiculous joke. However, the Chinese Kuomintang sticks to its long-held aspiration of "the world belongs to all," and in order to allow the people to recuperate and recover after the war, there was the convening of the "Political Consultative Conference" and the invitation for all parties and factions to participate in the government. However, some people regard this as the organization of a coalition government, attempting to deceive people without any political common sense.</p>
<p>In short, China, after a long period of war, certainly needs a stable order so that the people have an opportunity to recuperate and recover. Moreover, the international situation does not allow us to have political disputes that would cause political instability in our country. The Chinese Kuomintang, as the ruling party at present, is deeply aware of this domestic and international situation and sincerely hopes that all parties and factions, for the sake of national interests, will work together to participate in actual politics. The term coalition government, which undermines the existing legal system, is close to provocation and is not what the Chinese people, who are yearning for good governance, expect. We hope that all parties and factions will put national interests first, so that the people will see more heartfelt cooperation and fewer eccentric and provocative arguments!</p>

<h3>Eleventh Council Unanimously Passes Motion to Protect Personal Freedom; Requests City Government to Instruct Military and Police Agencies to Comply; Advocates Inviting Representatives from Central Agencies to Attend and Report</h3>
<p>[Reported by This Newspaper] The Shanghai Provisional Council held its eleventh general assembly and memorial week at 9:15 a.m. yesterday. Thirty-three councilors were present. Secretary-General Xiang Changquan reported that the telegram from the council to Chairman Chiang had been replied by the Office of the Civil Secretary of the National Government. Councillors Yu Zhijing, Yan Yu, and Xu Guomao, who recently reported, were included in the Second Review Committee.</p>
<p>General Assembly Passes Motion to Build Martyrs' Shrine</p>
<p>The general assembly began with Xu Shihao reporting on the investigation of whether the materials from the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration were fully used to relieve the people. According to Liu Hongsheng's response, they were indeed used to relieve the people and were not allocated for office expenses. Subsequently, Speaker Jing sought the opinions of the general assembly on the proposals reviewed by the First Committee. A total of three proposals were passed: (1) Request the municipal government to build a Martyrs' Shrine to those who died in the War of Resistance, establish a memorial tower to the martyrs who died in the War of Resistance, and establish a public cemetery for the martyrs who died in the War of Resistance; (2) Request the central government to increase the number of worker representatives in the local representation quota; (3) Request the Health Bureau to establish a health research and guidance institution to study issues and methods related to national health, guide implementation, and earnestly promote it in schools and factories to improve national health, strive for production, and complete construction. The municipal government is requested to adopt the principles, deliberate on methods, and earnestly implement them. Shen Chunhui explained the above proposals in detail. In addition, Zhou Xuexiang, the reviewer of the work report of the Labor and Police Bureau, reported on the review process. The Secretary-General read the original report, and the councilors proposed that the review results be submitted to the general assembly for a decision, rather than a discussion.</p>
<p>Emergency Motion: Protecting Personal Freedom. Vice Speaker Wu reported that more than two-thirds of the councilors had signed an emergency motion to the general assembly on the issue of legally protecting the people's personal freedom. The municipal government is requested to inform the Garrison Headquarters, the Police Bureau, and other relevant agencies to strictly abide by the following legal procedures: (1) The detention or arrest of people shall be in accordance with the provisions of Article 77, Paragraph 3 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. Except for cases of flagrant offense, an arrest warrant must first be issued by the prosecutor or the judge; (2) The criminal suspect who is arrested or detained must, in accordance with the provisions of Article 8, Paragraph 2 of the Provisional Constitution of the Tutelage Period, be transferred to the judicial organ within 24 hours; (3) When transferring a criminal suspect, it must be done actually and not just by transferring the case while continuing to detain the suspect. The councillors unanimously approved the proposal. However, there were different opinions on the procedures. Wang Genzhong proposed that this case should be established separately. Pan Xulun argued that in order to strengthen the resolution, a fourth point should be added: If the enforcing agency violates the above measures, it shall be severely punished. Xu Shihao expressed that there are already rules in the law for cases where stipulated articles are not legally enforced, so there is no need to add another item. Finally, Shen Chunhui proposed that this case be handed over to the Freedom Protection Association, which will be organized by the Lawyers Association, for handling.</p>
<p>Dispatching Representatives to Report Sparks Heated Debate</p>
<p>The issue of inviting representatives from relevant central agencies to attend and report sparked a heated debate among the councilors. Lü Entan asked why the request made by the last general assembly for relevant central agencies to attend, report, and answer inquiries had not been answered to this day. Speaker Xu immediately reported that a report from the Enemy Property Management Bureau of the Ministry of Economic Affairs had been received. If other agencies do not respond, it would seem disrespectful to the council. It was decided to ask the municipal government to notify them. Zhao Banfu immediately stood up and said: Losing face is a small matter. What does it matter if the council loses face? If we feel that we do not have the formal authority to ask them to report, then we can ask them to give us guidance. Zhan Wenhuan expressed that the Provisional Council is about to end. After spending so much money, time, and energy, have we solved the most serious problems facing us, such as prices, housing, and post-war relief supplies? Are we worthy of the citizens? He wanted everyone to reflect on this. As for directly asking the central government to send representatives to report, he fundamentally disagreed. We should use tactics, ask the Mayor and the heads of various bureaus to attend and report. If they cannot handle it, then we should ask the central authorities to attend and discuss. He proposed that time be set aside for two general assemblies for reporting. Ju Xuefan expressed his agreement and requested that relevant central agencies attend and report, especially paying attention to issues such as housing history, warehouses, supplies, and prices. In the end, Traditional first made a conclusion: "Everyone does not need to discuss, we must ask the central government to send representatives to report." Vice Speaker Xi proposed that the persons in charge of the municipal government report on Wednesday morning. Wang Genzhong asked how other units would attend if they had not received the report from the Property Bureau. Fan Cai said that the Food Department, the Fuel Committee, and the China Textile Construction Company should not be omitted. In the end, the Speaker reported that some of the other units had cancelled the report, and the Japanese Resident Management Committee had its own supervisor, so it was not a consultant. The Speaker asked: "Now we are voting, do we want to attend and report or not?" Everyone raised their hands. The meeting adjourned at 11:00 a.m. The fourth group review meeting was held in the afternoon.</p>
<p>All Members to Hold Picnic Today at Noon</p>
<p>The agenda of the general assembly has been slightly changed. This morning is the twelfth general assembly, this afternoon is the fifth group review meeting, and tomorrow morning is the thirteenth general assembly, where the municipal government will request that representatives of specially dispatched central agencies report. In the afternoon is the fourteenth general assembly to discuss the declaration and hold the adjournment ceremony. At noon today, all the councillors will hold a picnic at the Shanghai Branch of the Sanmin Zhuyi Youth League on Jin Shenfu Road. Newspaper reporters have also been invited to attend.</p>

<h3>Higher Court Prosecutor's Office Intensifies Interrogation of Traitor Gang - Zheng Hongnian and Others Interrogated Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Of the more than 400 major Chinese traitors detained by municipal military authorities, 173 have been transferred in two batches to judicial authorities for processing after a decision was made. Except for 16 who were sent to the Military Law Execution Supervision Department, the rest were detained in the Shanghai Prison at Tilanqiao and will be tried by the Higher Court. The remaining traitors will continue to be transferred within days. The batch detained in Tilanqiao Prison has been undergoing intensified interrogation and investigation by the Higher Court Prosecutor's Office in recent days, so that public prosecution can be initiated in the near future and a public trial held by the Higher Court. Yesterday, prosecutors such as Dai Rongduo and Liu Yanhong of the Higher Court Prosecutor's Office separately interrogated many people, including Zheng Hongnian (former President of the Puppet Central China Railway Company), Xu Jidun (former Director of the Puppet Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Public Works), Zhou Yuying (former Director of the Puppet Shanghai Municipal Social Welfare Bureau), Xu Jiang (former Director of the Puppet Shanghai Municipal Economic Bureau), Sun Yaodong (former General Manager of the Puppet Fuxing Bank), Wang Yongkang (owner of the Yong'an gambling establishment in Nanshi), as well as Fang Lixiang, Xie Zhongfu, and Li Hongfei, among others.</p>
<h3>Secretary-General of the Puppet Food Control Council Zhou Chunyu Scheduled for Sentencing - Puppet Censor Cao Yaoting Claims False Accusation, Xu Jichuan and Brother Deny Serving in Puppet Government</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The Higher Court yesterday morning heard two cases of suspected treason and false accusation involving Han traitor and puppet censor Cao Yaoting:</p>
<p>Cao Yaoting (1) Cao Yaoting, 47 years old, a local, served as a clerk in the Nanshi District Court and a recorder in the Second Special District Court before the war. He joined the puppet regime immediately after the war broke out, served as a liaison officer in "76," coerced judicial personnel to betray the motherland, and appointed himself as a puppet prosecutor. After the victory, he was prosecuted by the Higher Court Prosecutor's Office according to law. The case has been tried several times. He was interrogated again yesterday. The defendant denied everything except claiming that he was forced to become a puppet prosecutor, insisting that he was falsely accused and inviting Guo Xiaoxian and Chen Yiming to testify.</p>
<p>Xu Jichuan and Xu Yuanlai (2) Xu Jichuan, 47 years old, and Xu Yuanlai, 43 years old, from Hai'ning, Zhejiang, are brothers. During a recent household registration check in the city, the police station found that Xu Jichuan had served as a counselor in the Puppet National Government's Civil Affairs Office, and Xu Yuanlai had served as a secretary in the Puppet Ministry of Finance's Income Tax Bureau. The Higher Court Prosecutor's Office investigated and believed that they had violated the Regulations for the Punishment of Traitors and initiated public prosecution. Yesterday, the defendants claimed in court that during the 32nd year of the puppet regime, a self-defense force was organized in Shanghai, and they had to take turns on guard duty. At that time, there were rumors of conscription. In order to avoid service, their father forged names and falsely reported to cover them up. In reality, one was an antique appraiser, and the other worked at the Bank of Communications. They had never participated in puppet positions at all and requested the court to investigate, they said. They also hired lawyers such as Qin Shouzhang to defend them. The court ordered that the above two cases would be investigated further and adjourned for another hearing. The defendants were remanded.</p>
<p>The collegial panel continued to hear two cases in the afternoon:</p>
<p>Zhou Chunyu (1) Zhou Chunyu, 43 years old, from Ningbo, was once invited by Yuan Gude to serve as the Secretary-General of the Puppet Rice and Grain Control Council. Later, in November of the 33rd year of the puppet regime, he was accused of dereliction of duty and sentenced to five years in prison, which he is currently serving. After the victory, the Higher Court Prosecutor's Office re-interrogated him and believed that he had violated the Regulations for the Punishment of Traitors and initiated public prosecution. The defendant confessed that he had held a puppet position but claimed that he had tried his best to promote the distribution of household rice. Later, he was arrested and sentenced because of a conflict of opinion with the Japanese, he said. The prosecutor indicted him for colluding with the enemy country and collecting military rations on their behalf. The defendant hired lawyer Huang Nengren to respond.</p>
<p>Huang Junjie (2) Huang Junjie, 29 years old, from Nanhui, served as a member of the reconnaissance team of the Puppet Shanghai Security Command in August of the 32nd year of the puppet regime. On February 2, of the 34th year of the puppet regime, he arrested underground anti-Japanese workers Yang Zhizhong, Yang Yuguang, Jiang Shoulai, and others at the Xingzhou Hotel No. 2 and sent them to the headquarters for sentencing. After being reported by the victims, the Higher Court Prosecutor's Office completed the investigation and initiated public prosecution. However, the defendant firmly denied that he had held a puppet position and arrested Yang Zhizhong and others. He also hired lawyer Tang Huaiqun to defend him.</p>
<p>The debate in the above two cases has concluded, and the court announced that the sentencing will take place at 2:00 PM on the 15th.</p>
<h3>Sealing Up Former Japanese Residences - Handled in 15 Groups - New Regulations for Handling These Vacant Houses to Be Promulgated</h3>
<p>In order to handle the vacant houses left behind by former Japanese residents, the municipal military and political authorities have organized a joint agency composed of the municipal government, the Songhu Garrison Headquarters, the Third Front Army, and the Enemy and Puppet Property Disposal Bureau to jointly investigate and handle the matter. It is estimated that there are more than 8,000 houses in the former Japanese concentration area. Since the 5th of this month, they have been temporarily sealed off after the Japanese residents returned to prevent disputes. The personnel responsible for the investigation and sealing are all dispatched by the relevant agencies and are divided into 15 groups to carry out the sealing work separately. At 10:00 AM yesterday morning, these 15 groups of workers held a work review meeting at the Prisoner of War Management Office. More than 40 people, including Chief Wang Gongxia of the Garrison Headquarters, attended, and Zou Renzhi, Deputy Director of the Prisoner of War Management Office, was elected as chairman. First, each group reported on the investigation and sealing situation, and then the difficulties of the work were discussed. It is understood that all of the more than 8,000 vacant houses left by Japanese residents in the city need to be investigated. Once the new regulations for handling these vacant houses are promulgated, they will be handled in accordance with the new regulations. In the past, in the former Japanese concentration area, many unscrupulous people illegally occupied the houses because the Japanese residents had moved away. In order to provide accommodation for public educators who came to Shanghai from the Great Rear Area and to protect the rights and interests of the owners, the authorities decided to jointly manage the remaining vacant houses of the Japanese.</p>
<h3>Mobile Homes - Approximately 2,000 Units - To Be Shipped to Shanghai</h3>
<p>In order to alleviate the housing panic, the government authorities have ordered 10,000 mobile homes from the United States and Canada, which will arrive here in the near future. 8,000 of them are planned to be used in Nanjing to provide housing for government employees. 2,000 units are for Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Two Fires</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] A fire broke out at 10:11 AM yesterday morning at the Air Force No. 23 oil and bomb warehouse on Qimei Road in Pudong. The fire was extinguished by the fire brigade after two hours of rescue, and two bungalows were burned down.</p>
<p>Also, at about 1:12 AM this morning, the Yuanfeng cigarette and paper shop at No. 118, Lane, Guangxi Road, caught fire due to carelessness, spreading to cotton quilts, mattresses, furniture, and other items. The Central Fire Department dispatched vehicles to rescue the fire and extinguished it at 2:30 AM. The loss was said to be minor.</p>
<h3>Worth Over Ten Million Yuan - 80 Boxes of Pigments Stolen from Warehouse Late at Night - Shipped Away by Boat, Police Intervene, Thugs Escape, Stolen Goods Recovered</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] At 2:40 AM yesterday morning, more than 30 thugs wearing military uniforms and plain clothes suddenly entered a warehouse at No. 944, North Suzhou Road, which was managed by the Enemy and Puppet Property Disposal Bureau. They tied up several petitioners and workers with ropes, covered their heads with quilts, and forbade them from making any noise. They carried 80 boxes of pigments worth over ten million yuan out on their shoulders. At that time, a patrol leader of the security team came forward to investigate but was brutally beaten. The thugs secretly transported the goods to the Suzhou River in the south, loaded them onto a boat, and sailed west. At that time, two patrolling police officers from the North Station Branch Bureau spotted them. One police officer urgently reported to the branch bureau by telephone, while the other police officer blew his whistle and chased after them. When they reached the west side of the Central Market near the New Garbage Bridge on Xizang Road, the police officer reported to the Zhabei Branch Police Station stationed nearby and joined forces to arrest them. At the same time, Lu Bihou, director of the North Station Branch Bureau, and Li Jiachu, chief of the criminal section, led a number of armed police officers in a police car to the scene. Because it was late at night and extremely dark, the thugs on the boat finally escaped to the shore. All the stolen goods, along with three boatmen and a boat, were seized, and the boatmen were taken back to the branch bureau for investigation. When the incident occurred, a petitioner's firearm in the warehouse was robbed but was later found in the house.</p>
<h3>Election of Representatives in the 36th Bao of the 11th District - Opposition Arises - Illegal Meeting Resembles a Farce</h3>
<p>The 36th Bao of the 11th District of the city held a bao people's congress at Jingde Elementary School on Da Tong Road on the afternoon of the 6th to elect district people's representatives. The bao office stipulated in the notice that the meeting would start at 2:30 PM but was delayed until 2:40 PM before it began. It only lasted for five minutes, and the election was completed. The ballot count showed a total of more than 350 votes. At that time, the citizens present questioned that today only took five minutes to hastily complete the ten items on the agenda, which shows that this election was purely a package deal and raised questions: (1) This bao has a total of 28 jia, each jia should have at least 20 households, which should have 560 households. If each household has one person, there should be 560 people. Calculating the majority attendance, there should be more than 280 people. Only 227 people attended today, which is obviously less than the legal number of people, so the meeting cannot be held according to law. (2) The number of election tickets received exceeds 50% of the number of people present. There are also many underage children, who of course have no election qualifications. (3) There was only one ballot box at the time of voting, so why are there two ballot boxes at the time of counting? Neither of them had been checked and sealed by the election supervisors in advance. (4) The election supervisors Wang Nancong and Chen Yangzhou, sent by the district office, did not check the number of attendees before distributing the election tickets, and they did not check the number of tickets received during the counting. There was also a lack of compliance in the procedure. And the election supervisor Wang Nancong actually replied that the 36th bao were all ignorant and uneducated, and turned his head and left without looking back. The meeting was held in the open air that day, and the chairman did not arrive. An "unknown person" served as a representative, sitting high on the steps. The citizens present said that it was no less than staging an open-air farce. Because the election of district people's representatives is important, it was actually held in the form of a changing-empty-box drama. The result of this election cannot be effective according to law, and so on.</p>
<h3>Textile Machinery Manufacturing Company - Holds Board of Directors Meeting</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Economic Affairs previously took over textile factories, including cotton, wool, linen, silk, spinning, and textile machinery repair factories, all of which have been transferred to the China National Textile Corporation for management. Then, when President Song came to Shanghai last time, he ordered that part of the textile machinery repair factories be handed over and changed to the China Textile Machinery Manufacturing Company. State-owned factories use their own factory real estate as shareholders, and private yarn factories share the share amount based on the existing number of spindles in each factory, with each spindle valued at 10,000 yuan in national currency. Currently, the state-owned part accounts for 300 million yuan, and the private part also accounts for 300 million yuan. Peng Xuepei has been elected as the chairman of the company, and Huang Boqiao has been elected as the general manager. China National Textile Corporation has successively transferred the Far East Steel Wire Cloth Factory, the Japanese Machinery Manufacturing Factory, the East Asia Iron Factory, the Youxin Iron Factory, and the Toyota Automobile Factory to the company. At 2:00 PM yesterday afternoon, a board of directors meeting was held in the China Bank Building.</p>
<h3>Killing of American Pilots Case - Sawada Shigeru Blames Tokyo</h3>
<p>Today Will Be the Final Court Session</p>
<p>Today will be the last day of the trial of the killing of pilots belonging to General Doolittle, which has lasted for four weeks. Yesterday, Lieutenant General Sawada Shigeru, commander of the 13th Army, Captain Wakou Isamu, judge of the Shanghai Jiangwan Court, and prosecutor Okada Ryuhei, defendant defense lawyer Tatsuta Gaitsujiro, and others were questioned again in court. Sawada Shigeru was questioned for as long as four hours. According to the 59-year-old commander of the 12th Army, he had served in the military for 40 years and had been sent to Turkey, Poland, Brazil, and other countries as a military attache. He had also traveled to England, the United States, France, Switzerland, and other countries twice. From 1941 to 1945, he was sent to Shanghai to command the 13th Army. He has a wife and two children, all in Japan. Sawada Shigeru blamed the Tokyo government for the killing of the Doolittle pilots, saying that he had no right to execute them because Tokyo had an instruction that this case was serious and everything had to be instructed by the Tokyo government. But he admitted to signing the judgment. Wakou Isamu, a judge of the Japanese military court, was also questioned. When Prosecutor Okada Ryuhei was questioned, he admitted that he had opened the trial without meeting with the criminals and that he only knew the bottom line of the three pilots from their confessions. The plaintiffs' defense lawyers believed that they did not investigate the case clearly and pronounced the sentence, which was illegal. Finally, Tatsuta Gaitsujiro was called to the stand. This person's hair was already mottled and he had a short beard. When questioned, he changed his answers repeatedly. At 5:00 PM, the presiding judge announced that the trial would continue today.</p>
<h3>China National Textile Corporation Staff - Suspends Group "Leave" - Salaries Paid as Usual, Cost of Living Index Issued</h3>
<p>The employees of the factories affiliated to the State-owned China Textile Corporation believe that their treatment is still meager compared to that of private yarn factories. A request was made some time ago: (1) Increase basic salary, (2) Provide subsidies according to the municipal government's cost of living index, otherwise, a group "leave" would be taken this morning.束雲章, general manager of the company, specially summoned the persons in charge of each factory yesterday morning to have a heartfelt conversation, encouraging them to recognize the overall situation and work hard to increase production. After the representatives of each factory explained to their respective employees, the result was that the proposed measure was cancelled and no disturbances occurred. According to China Textile Corporation, the salaries and allowances of its employees will be paid in accordance with the cost-of-living index of the municipal government, with a maximum of 300,000 yuan, from February onwards, as decided by the board of directors, fearing that the superior treatment of private yarn factories would affect production.</p>
<h3>Central Printing Plant Received the Press Yesterday</h3>
<p>Explanation of the Labor Dispute</p>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] In order to clarify the settlement of the labor dispute in the factory to all sectors of society, the Central Printing Plant held a reception for the press in the city at the Kang Le Restaurant at 4:00 PM yesterday. About 20 reporters from various newspapers attended. Gao Jie, the director of the factory, gave a report, stating: The factory is a state-owned currency printing institution. After the victory, it was ordered to come to Shanghai to take over the former puppet Central Reserve Printing Office and has been printing banknotes for half a year. The factory knows that production efficiency must be coordinated with workers' treatment. Therefore, in the past six months, workers' treatment has been adjusted monthly. Recently, rules for technical hygiene rewards and punishments have been promulgated. If workers can work hard to follow them, male apprentices can earn more than 60,000 yuan per month, second-level technicians can earn more than 80,000 yuan, first-level technicians can earn more than 100,000 yuan, and senior technicians can earn more than 120,000 yuan. If they work overtime for three hours a day, they can earn 50% more. This standard is higher than that of general counterparts, but the workers are still dissatisfied and suddenly went on strike on March 25 without any reason, without sending representatives or submitting a written report in advance. Although the factory repeatedly posted notices to resume work, and the Social Bureau sent people to mediate, all efforts were ineffective, resulting in the suspension of work in the factory for four days. After the factory investigated, it was found that the strike was obviously manipulated by a small number of people. Therefore, on March 30, a notice was issued, strictly ordering all workers to resume work immediately, otherwise, they would be fired. At the same time, the list of about 125 people who were the minority was found and announced to be fired. Most of the workers came to the factory to resume work after hearing the news that day. By April 1, all of them had resumed work. The bottom salary and the reinstatement of the fired workers are decided by the Social Bureau's arbitration method, and will be followed accordingly. Finally, he explained that the factory is a state-run organization and there is no situation where the capitalists exploit the workers. He hoped that all employees of the factory would be able to overcome difficulties together to achieve success.</p>

The police department has strictly ordered their removal.

<h3>Vice Minister of Finance Lu Peizhang Passed Away Yesterday</h3>
<p>Lu Peizhang, Vice Minister of Finance, came to Shanghai last month to treat his long-standing stomach cancer. He was admitted to the Chinese Red Cross Hospital on the 27th of last month for surgery, which went well. However, on the morning of the 6th, pleurisy and pneumonia occurred, and his condition deteriorated. He fell into a coma on the morning of the 8th and passed away at 9:00 AM. The body was sent to the China Funeral Home, and the coffin will be placed in the hall on the 11th. It is reported that Kong Xiangxi and Chen Xing, among others, visited to pay their respects.

He graduated from Jinling University in his early years and successively served as Secretary of the Chiang Kai-shek Camp, Secretary of the Ministry of Industry, Director of the Fisheries and Animal Husbandry Division, Anhui Security Commander, and Chief Examiner of the Ministry of Finance.</p>
<h3>Relief Food Arrives in Large Quantities - Distribution Methods Still Under Discussion</h3>
<p>The food supply to the city has been abundant in the past week, especially the relief supplies transported by the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA), of which food accounts for almost two-thirds. Ships that have arrived in Shanghai in recent days and have begun unloading include the Jefferson, with 6,367 tons of wheat, the Sammon, with 5,243 tons of wheat flour and rice, the Urton, with 3,135 tons of wheat and milk, and the New Zealand, with 3,170 tons of wheat flour. How this large amount of food will be distributed is still to be determined by the authorities.</p>
<h3>All Reserved Seating - Cinemas in Great Difficulty</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] According to an employee of the city's Cinema Business Association, if the municipal police department's measures for managing cinemas are fully implemented, the city's cinemas will be forced to close. In particular, the police department recently stipulated that all 15 first and second-run cinemas must implement all reserved seating starting on the 19th of this month. This makes it even more difficult for cinemas to cope. The seating in the main halls of the cinemas has never been reserved. Now, it is necessary to print reserved seating tickets separately, which is not only costly in terms of printing but also results in wasted tickets if they are not sold, which only increases intangible losses. In addition, the cinemas must hire a large number of ushers, which puts a heavier burden on salaries. And most of the audience will hold reserved tickets, so they will rush to the theater only when the movie starts, which will affect the order of the cinema. The industry has suffered a sharp decline in business since the authorities levied a 50% entertainment tax. Although the highest ticket price has been doubled to 1,080 yuan, it is only 540 times the pre-war highest ticket price of two yuan, while the expenditure of various expenses in the cinema business has been 2,000 to 3,000 times that of the pre-war period, so it is difficult to maintain. Sometimes, it is necessary to show four movies a day to make up for the losses. However, the police department's regulations only allow four shows on Sundays or holidays and limit the number of shows to three on other days, which will have a greater impact on the operating income of the cinemas.</p>
<h3>Robbery in Menghua Street, Nanjing</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Four thieves broke into the home of Qi Peilin, a local girl at No. 51, Sanxing Street, Menghua Street, Nanshi, at around 10:00 AM yesterday.

<h3>Police Department Begins Processing - Examination of Opium Addicts</h3>
<p>The registration of opium addicts for self-renewal in the city by the Municipal Police Department was completed by the end of last month. In order to implement the examination and detoxification of registered opium addicts, the detoxification institute attached to the police hospital will now start to examine opium addicts from today. The first batch will examine the opium addicts who were apprehended and sent by the police stations in various districts. In addition, the police department has launched a campaign to search for and arrest opium addicts by all plainclothes police officers, and the results have been very good. The household heads in various districts are also proceeding with signing the affidavit.</p>

<h3>Major Players Manipulate Public Bonds, Cashing Out at High Prices; Chinese and Foreign Stocks Weak Upon Opening</h3>
<p>Public bonds were still manipulated by fellow traders yesterday, with continuous releases after reaching high prices. Class C bonds opened at 4,700 yuan and once reached a new high of 4,880 yuan. Many parties took profits and gradually reduced positions, dropping to a low of 4,100 yuan. They struggled around 4,250 yuan at noon, eventually closing down 300 yuan from the previous close. Class E bonds rebounded slightly by about 100 yuan. Other miscellaneous bonds rose slightly due to time constraints. Chinese stocks were weak upon opening, with bulls taking profits. With government agencies relocating to Nanjing within the month, the small market was apprehensive, and many parties dared not over-operate, making supply and demand difficult to balance. Stocks continued to decline after opening. Wing On Cotton Mill once fell to 4,800 yuan, Mayar Silk Mill to 3,850 yuan, and Jingfu to 388 yuan, before hovering around these levels. Selling occurred near noon, resulting in slight stability at noon. However, less popular stocks could not recover and closed at lower prices. At noon, the textile sector, which was hot last Saturday, fell by more than half a percent. Less popular stocks like New Light fell by more than 10%. The afternoon was even more sluggish, with sensitive investors taking profits. Wing On Cotton Mill, Mayar Silk Mill, and Jingfu shouted lower by about half a percent. Foreign stocks still saw securities firms taking profits yesterday, opening weakly. The supply of goods was abundant, lacking support, and closed at low prices at noon. Compared to last Saturday, except for the Reclamation and Cultivation Company, which fell slightly, all others fell by 10% to 15%.</p>
<h3>Gold Prices Continue to Fall</h3>
<p>Down 55,000 from Last Saturday</p>
<p>Yesterday, reports of continued gold arrivals further dispersed sentiment, and the market was exceptionally weak. It opened flat but gradually declined, dropping to around 1.44 million at noon. Transactions were limited. It stabilized briefly in the afternoon but was soon pressured by scattered selling, resulting in further declines and closing at lower prices, down 55,000 from last Saturday. Gold ornaments were priced at 158,000, refined silver at 1,600, and silver dollars hovered around 1,050 yuan. The black market interest rate was flat, ranging from 1.5 to 1.8 cents. Off-market positions were tighter, with interest rates around 2 cents.</p>
<h3>U.S. Dollars and Hong Kong Notes Both Lower</h3>
<p>Foreign currencies and U.S. dollars followed the fluctuations of gold prices. It initially started around 1,910 yuan but soon retreated to within 1,900 yuan. Although there were settlements from off-market, the lack of speculative activity overwhelmed buyers, and it hovered around 1,880 yuan at noon. Hedging against gold was at 760 yuan per ten taels, with significant hedging purchases, making the afternoon situation stronger than the gold market. Ultimately, it fell 35 yuan compared to last Saturday. Hong Kong notes also declined, with old notes falling 20 yuan and new notes falling 30 yuan. Robbie was at 490 yuan, and Hong Kong Electric at 390 yuan, with sellers.</p>
<h3>Gold Pawns Not Yet Lifted</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Shanghai] Recent reports claimed that the Ministry of Finance had lifted the ban on gold pawns. This reporter inquired with the Office of the Special Commissioner for Finance and Banking, and the person in charge stated that according to the Ministry of Finance's telegram of January 23 of this year, it is still prohibited for banks and pawnshops to accept loans with gold as collateral. The rumor of lifting the ban is a misunderstanding.</p>
<h3>Abundant Grain Arrivals, Market Initially Firm, Then Weak; Oil Prices Plummet by 5,000 to 6,000</h3>
<p>Yesterday's rice market was firm in the morning but weak in the afternoon. Medium-grade japonica rice rose slightly, while indica rice remained unchanged. Flour trading was sluggish, with prices remaining flat. Soybean sales were weak, down 1,000 yuan. Soybean cake was sluggish, down 200 to 300 yuan. Bran was down 200 to 300 yuan. Raw kernels were poorly digested by both local and foreign merchants, down 2,000 to 3,000 yuan. Cotton cake sales were sluggish as most factories used diesel fuel, down 300 to 400 yuan. The oil market saw a sharp decline of 5,000 to 6,000 yuan due to a continued large influx of goods arriving from Qingdao, creating oversupply and a sluggish market. The future trend remains unpredictable.</p>
<p>Furthermore, according to rice market sources, a total of over 11,000 piculs of seven types of rice arrived in the city yesterday.

Spot trading was also weak. Shantou sugar has been inactive for a long time and has finally seen transactions. Jieyang green sugar was traded at 52,000 yuan for 62 bags, and Shantou refined red sugar was quoted at 66,000 yuan for 50 bags.

Yesterday, Tianjin walnuts opened at 45,000 yuan, and southern walnuts at 35,000 yuan, with a total of one hundred and several dozen bags traded, down several thousand yuan each compared to before.</p>
<h3>Yarn Prices Plummet; Textile Construction Increases Auction Frequency</h3>
<p>Yarn prices fell significantly yesterday because simple weaving mills found that the cost of yarn was not covered by the price of finished products, and there were also unsold goods. In recent days, they have not been willing to purchase raw materials, and customer sales have been sluggish due to weak prices in the inland. Sentiment was greatly softened, and the market was filled with sell orders with very few transactions. Horse brand fell by 100,000, and the rest fell by about 60,000 to 80,000. At noon, Textile Construction Corporation posted prices. There were as many as 25 types of yarn ranging from 1 count to 100 count. The bid price for 20 count was reduced by 60,000, the bid price for 32 count was reduced by 80,000, and the bid price for 40 count or higher was reduced by 100,000 to 270,000, with the most severe being 60 count Yanghe single yarn, which was reduced by 270,000. Overall, there were very few purchasers of yarn from yarn companies, cloth factories, and dyeing and weaving factories. According to Textile Construction Corporation's announcement, starting immediately, cotton yarn will be sold every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, cotton cloth will be sold every Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday, and woolens will be sold every Wednesday and Saturday. With more auction opportunities, commodity prices will inevitably be further suppressed.</p>
<h3>Raw Cotton Market Weak</h3>
<p>Yesterday, New York's American cotton futures rose by 16 to 27 points. Spot prices were calculated at American dollars 28.19 for near-term, 28.51 for far-term, and Meitling spot at 28.79. Spot cotton trading in Shanghai was average. Affected by the sharp drop in yarn prices, the market was also soft, down 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. Textile Construction Corporation and most private yarn factories took no action. Only Chongming Fuan Yarn Factory had a slight appetite for American Pengjiapo cotton.</p>
<h3>Siamese Teak Shipped</h3>
<p>The timber market is sluggish. It is reported that Siamese merchants have shipped teak, totaling over 40,000 feet, and the asking price is quite low, which may affect the market prices of teak and Lauan in Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Large Batch of Hardware Imports, Totaling Over 5,000 Tons</h3>
<p>The British ship Samson, managed by the shipping manager of Tiansiang Foreign Company, arrived from New York yesterday at Wusongkou. It is expected to enter the port today and dock at the Pootung Blue Funnel Wharf. The ship carries a large amount of hardware of various sizes from the United States, totaling 5,000 tons, all of which is general cargo.</p>
<h3>Coal and Firewood Prices Continue to Fall</h3>
<p>The coal market continued its previous decline, showing a weak trend, with sellers following one another. The number of buyers was minimal, and the price cutting was severe, leading to a general decline in market prices. Firewood from all routes arrived in large quantities. Due to the continuous decline in market prices, traders were mostly taking a wait-and-see approach. Due to financial constraints, customers preferred to sell at reduced prices, which further depressed prices.</p>
<p>Coal Briquette Factories Resume Production</p>
<p>According to coal briquette industry sources yesterday, major mechanized coal briquette factories in Shanghai, such as Yitaixing, Nanyang, Guohua, Lingfang, Jinghua, and Xinfu, have recently installed machinery and obtained sufficient coal dust and electricity for briquette production. They have gradually resumed production, significantly increasing the output of coal briquettes. It is said that these factories have obtained raw materials at relatively low prices, which has lowered production costs. Those who use hand-operated machines to make briquettes are unable to compete and are seeking alternative solutions, such as expanding their operations or ceasing production.</p>
<h3>Confiscated Yarn and Cloth Case: Processing Bureau Refuses Return; Victims to File Administrative Appeal According to Law; Resolutions of the People's Political Council in Five Points</h3>
<p>The various guilds, such as Shanghai's dyeing and weaving factories, cotton cloth dealers, and yarn dealers, have repeatedly published reports requesting the return of the remaining yarn and cloth forcibly purchased by the enemy and puppet regimes. It is now learned that the guilds previously held a hearing at the Enemy and Puppet Property Review Conference, which ruled that the yarn and cloth had already been moved and sold, making it impossible to verify and liquidate, and dismissed the request. Later, based on legal principles and facts, the guilds submitted a petition for reconsideration to the Enemy and Puppet Property Processing Bureau, which issued a response with Shanghai Sanzi No. 18913, stating, "The puppet regime purchased the yarn and cloth in August and September of the 32nd year of the Republic [1943]. At that time, the method of paying for the purchase was extremely generous, and a deposit was paid. Unless merchants intentionally hoarded yarn and cloth, there was no loss. Based on legal principles, the purchase of yarn and cloth had contracts and warehouse receipts, which were also delivered, and the sales process was completed. Therefore, there is no basis for returning it." According to the persons in charge of the three guilds, the members of the guilds believe that the handling by the Enemy Property Processing Bureau damages the rights of the people. They have issued letters of authorization, entrusting the persons in charge of the guilds to file an administrative appeal according to law, and are currently engaging lawyers to prepare for the process. They also stated that the guilds previously appealed to the People's Political Council to request a lawful handling and return of the yarn and cloth confiscated by the enemy and puppet regimes. The People's Political Council resolved, "This case is approved and handed over to the government for investigation and proper handling." The five resolution measures of the People's Political Council are extracted below: (1) Victims whose yarn and cloth were forcibly purchased by the enemy and puppet regimes and who have not received the purchase price shall be returned the yarn and cloth based on the quantity purchased and supporting documents. (2) Victims who have received a portion of the purchase price for the yarn and cloth purchased shall be returned a portion of the yarn and cloth based on the portion of the price not received, based on supporting documents. (3) If the remaining yarn and cloth is insufficient to cover the portion of the price not received by the victim, the remaining yarn and cloth shall be issued to the victim first based on supporting documents. The government shall compile the cases for the insufficient amount and seek compensation from Japan. (4) If the yarn and cloth forcibly purchased from victims after the government's takeover and for which the price was not received has already been sold by the government for public purposes, the amount received at the time of the sale shall be issued to the victim based on supporting documents to offset the loss. (5) If the yarn and cloth for which the purchase price was not received by the victim still exists and the government deems it necessary to retain it for use, the Enemy Property Processing Bureau shall, in conjunction with the local chamber of commerce and the relevant trade association, assess the price and purchase it.</p>

<h3>Unrest at Yingshih University to Be Resolved Soon</h3>
<p>Permanent Campus Site Designated by Ministry Order as Jinhua</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent, Yongjia] Since moving to Wenzhou, the student self-governance association of National Yingshih University has published the Yingshih Review newspaper, and the school authorities have dissuaded them from interfering in school administration through their remarks. Students believe that the school is implementing high-pressure tactics, so they incited unrest. Principal Du resigned to the Ministry of Education because of the thorny handling, but it was not approved. All the professors in the school also wrote a letter to retain him, but Mr. Du still expressed negativity and has not returned to school. Last month, the school was ordered to expel five students who were the leaders of the incident, and students from the Faculty of Law and Agriculture went on strike and marched in protest. Recently, fourth-year students from the two faculties have resumed classes.

<h3>A Few Opinions on Higher Education in the Future</h3>
<p>— Dong Qijun</p>
<p>Education and culture are the lifeblood of a nation, and higher education in particular is sufficient to determine a nation's future. During the war, higher education suffered from many pathologies, which is undeniable. Now that various schools are about to reopen and construction is about to begin, I would like to offer some humble opinions on the future of higher education for the consideration of the authorities and for discussion with the social elite:</p>
<p>(1) The Issue of Relocation: During the war, most universities and specialized schools moved inland. After the victory, cultural restoration will naturally take place. Although the central government has a clear plan regarding the issue of relocation, the various schools have not only created a rift with the central government, but also caused internal disputes and disagreements. I believe that the issue of school relocation is of great importance to the future of a nation's culture, and the government must have a comprehensive and rational plan to implement it.</p>
<p>Before the war, most institutions of higher learning were concentrated in Beijing, Tianjin, and Shanghai, while during the war they were mostly concentrated in Chongqing, Chengdu, Kunming, and their vicinity. We cannot endorse either of these distorted phenomena before or during the war. I believe that schools should not be concentrated in a distorted way, but should be developed universally. We have made the mistake of uneven distribution before and during the war, and we must not repeat it after the war. Now we should set up a university or specialized school in every city with a population of more than 400,000, based on population ratios; every provincial capital should have a university and a normal college; and cities in remote provinces with a population of more than 200,000, although less than 400,000, also need to set up universities and specialized schools in order to promote culture due to their low cultural standards. This is not only "tailoring measures to suit the people" but also "tailoring measures to suit the land." For example, Shanghai, Hankou, Tianjin, and Guangzhou, as famous commercial ports in the country, need to establish commercial universities in addition to ordinary universities. Other examples include the Northeast, which is rich in mineral resources, should set up mining and metallurgical schools; the Taihu Lake basin should set up sericulture schools; the Northwest should set up agricultural schools; and the coastal areas of Zhejiang should set up fisheries schools. These are all necessary measures tailored to local conditions.</p>
<p>After the war, various schools are seeking to reopen, while the education authorities are seeking the universal development of education and culture. Under a reasonable and comprehensive plan that has already been decided, they should resist all opinions and keep some of the universities and specialized schools in the rear. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Two or Three Things About the Frontier of Kang and Tibet</h3>
<p>— Kangding Correspondence, March 28th, Deng Zhongjian</p>
<p>Like a riddle, the frontier region finally had its mysterious veil lifted for us during the War of Resistance. Now, the reporter will try to describe the once mysterious Kang-Tibetan border region to give the readers of this newspaper a taste.</p>
<p>Deng Tong Starved to Death, Zhuge Liang Made Arrows</p>
<p>During the reign of Emperor Wen of the Han Dynasty, there was a diviner who was good at physiognomy. Emperor Wen ordered him to examine his favored courtier Deng Tong. The diviner said that he would surely starve to death. The Emperor thought, "How can I let my favored courtier starve to death?" So he deliberately enfeoffed him with the copper mountain in Sichuan, meaning that his money would never be exhausted. Once, the Emperor suffered from sores, and Deng Tong licked them with his tongue, and he was healed. At that time, Prince Jing was still the Crown Prince, and Emperor Wen sighed and said, "Even a prince, is not as good as a subject." This aroused the jealousy of Prince Jing. When he ascended the throne, he put Deng Tong in prison, and he eventually starved to death, as the diviner had said. It is said that Rongjing County in present-day Xikang Province is where the copper mountain was located, and Kangding, an important town in present-day Sichuan and Xikang, is where Zhuge Wuhou ordered the general Zheng Ying to build a furnace to make arrows during his southern expedition. Therefore, it is also called Dajianlu (literally "arrow forging furnace").</p>
<p>Faces Covered in Black, Resembling Monsters</p>
<p>Most people traveling to Kang and Tibet pass through Kangding, through Ganzi, Changdu, and arrive in Lhasa. Many of the people you encounter on the road cover their eyes with gauze or smear their faces with black oil, making you confused, like seeing ghosts in broad daylight. But please don't be afraid, this is just their protective measure against nature. Because the terrain in Kang and Tibet is too high, the mountains are all over 10,000 feet above sea level, and snow accumulates all year round, while the valleys between the mountains evaporate quickly and become semi-dry valleys covered with a thin layer of white salt or soda. If you don't wear a piece of gauze when you go out, you will feel that the sunlight reflected from all directions is very dazzling, and you may even suffer from color blindness. During the windy season in Kang and Tibet, the wind blows wildly, and the skin cracks. Folk songs say, "In the first, second, and third months, the snow seals the mountains; in the fourth, fifth, and sixth months, the mud covers the feet; the seventh, eighth, and ninth months are good for walking; in October, the skin cracks." So when you go out, you smear a layer of black grease on your face to avoid skin cracking.</p>
<p>Calling People to School, Like Conscripting Soldiers</p>
<p>Surprisingly, many public elementary schools can be found in the remote villages in the eastern part of Kang Province. Some are located in temples, but although there are many schools, there are very few students. Each school has only a dozen students, and many of them are bald-headed monks. All students are on public funds, but parents are still reluctant to send their children to school. The government has no choice but to order the distribution of ten people per pao (a kind of administrative division). Therefore, there is a name of "school official," and some are willing to pay someone to take their place. This is because the land is barren and the population is sparse, and even children have to participate in production. Also, the textbooks are too far from their living standards.</p>
<p>Lama World, Heavenly Buddhist Kingdom</p>
<p>In Kang and Tibet, an average of three or more people per family become monks, which shows how many lamas there are. They are divided into four major sects: Yellow, White, Red, and Black, all of which are respected. Some even take pride in drinking their urine, and others use their feces as medicine. Because there are so many lamas, there are naturally many temples. There are more than 40 temples between Yushu and Kangding alone. Each temple has hundreds of people at least and one or two thousand people at most. The temples are spacious and grand, with amazing capacity. There are also magical legends and sacred sites. The three major temples near Lhasa are the Zhebung Monastery, with 120 large pillars in one hall, which is spectacular. The monastery houses 9,000 lamas. The Taizhao Temple was built when Princess Wencheng married, and contains a statue of Sakyamuni Buddha from India. It is said that half of this Buddha statue is man-made and half is natural. This hall can accommodate 3,300 people. The Sera Monastery has 5,500 monks. Lamas are the masters of political and economic power, and their power is very great. In addition, in remote and desolate places, there are evil cultists who kill people. They believe that killing people who have not reached the end of their lives can代享其未来之福 (a Buddhist idea about reaping the benefits of the dead's good karma).</p>
<p>In Kang and Tibet, even a mountain, a cave, a river pool, and a lake are full of magical legends. The famous high mountain in southern Tibet, Mount Pibi La, although there are wild people, is considered to be the most supreme密宗法輪 (esoteric Buddhist Dharma wheel) . Therefore, going around the mountain once can bring thirteen billion功德 (merit) for the six-character mantra, and going around the mountainside once can bring thirty billion merit for the six-character mantra. Therefore, tourists are endless. In addition, the sacred shrines and the聖母海 (holy mother sea) in southern Tibet are said to be able to reflect all wishes and the results of one's life, like a karma mirror in the underworld. It is said that the Thirteenth Dalai Lama was found after being reflected from this sea. In short, such myths are readily available, making the entire Kang and Tibet no less than a heavenly Buddhist kingdom.</p>
<p>One Wife, Many Husbands, Matriarchal Society</p>
<p>In our China, polygamy is commonplace, but polyandry is probably only seen in Kang and Tibet. So-called polyandry means that, for example, three brothers in a family marry one wife. No matter who gives birth to the children, they all belong to the eldest brother, but to outsiders, they are called: "Children of so-and-so woman," and the second and third brothers are regarded as uncles. If one is a farmer, one is a lama, and one is a businessman, they share the joys of the family when they return home. When one brother sleeps with her first at night, he hangs a Buddhist rosary at the door. Those who come later touch the door and quietly leave when they see the rosary, never causing conflict. In Dajianlu, Ganzi, Darjeeling, and other places, there are even those who share the love of their wives with close friends, like the Eskimos, which is truly unique. Kang and Tibet also have a prevailing custom of sons-in-law living with the wife's family, so the family is centered on women. Women have the final say in all matters, both internal and external. Tibet also has so-called temporary marriages. Those who trade in Kang Province often come from far away in Shaanxi, Gansu, Sichuan, and Yunnan, and each trip lasts three to five years. They temporarily marry local women, and leave when they go. The two parties agree in advance that they will not pursue each other.</p>
<p>Cremation, Water Burial, Sky Burial, Animal Burial</p>
<p>The funerals in Kang and Tibet are also very peculiar, divided into four types: cremation, water burial, sky burial, and animal burial. It is said that the sky burial was created by Lord Yue (Yue Zhongqi). When Yue was in charge of Tibet, he saw dragon veins everywhere and was deeply afraid that the descendants of the Tibetans would harm China. Therefore, he advised them to feed the vultures after death instead of burying them. Also, the origin is that lamas believe that feeding birds after death is the most direct way to leave the underworld and be reborn. The method of sky burial is to tie the corpse's knees to the sides of the forehead and wrap it in a coat to transport it to the burial ground. The lamas who escort the funeral procession call and beckon the eagles and vultures along the way. Then, thousands of vultures, led by black vultures, circle around with the funeral procession. When they arrive at the burial ground, they remove the clothes and cover the head. First, the relatives and friends of the deceased cut the corpse into a swastika shape, and then the密宗 (esoteric Buddhist) lamas blow the tibia bone喇嘛 (lama flute) to summon the crows to eat. If the birds do not come down for a long time, it means that the deceased had committed sins during his lifetime. Then the esoteric Buddhist lamas try to attract them in various ways, or even cut them into pieces with a knife and feed them. The birds begin to come down. At this time, relatives and friends sit aside drinking alcohol and tea. After about an hour, the flesh is gone and the bones remain. Then the bones are crushed into powder and mixed with tsampa, and then fed to the vultures. Finally, the skull is crushed and still mixed with tsampa to make pills for the crows to eat, until nothing is left before returning.</p>

<h3>Joint Appeal Regarding the Current Situation in the Northeast</h3>
<p>(I)</p>
<p>We recently heard that the Military Mediation Execution Group will be sent to the Northeast to resolve the conflict between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party in the nine provinces of the Northeast. Upon hearing this news, we are filled with bewilderment! Before the restoration, there was no activity of Communist troops in the Northeast. After the restoration, a large number of illegal armed forces infiltrated and roamed around, burning, killing, looting, and disrupting the local area. Such bandit behavior should not be recognized by the government as any organized army. Moreover, according to the spokesperson of the Chinese Communist Party, there are no Communist troops in the Northeast, as is known to all Chinese people. According to the order to cease conflict on January 10, the National Army entered the Northeast without any restrictions, which was also agreed to by the Chinese Communist Party. Furthermore, according to the provisions of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, after the Soviet troops withdraw, they will hand over the Northeast to the National Government. Therefore, the takeover of the Northeast is purely a Sino-Soviet issue, not an issue between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, as is even more universally recognized by the Chinese people. Therefore, the National Army's takeover of the Northeast is a responsibility that should be fulfilled, and should not be subject to any further obstruction. However, the illegal forces scattered throughout the Northeast not only obstruct the advance of the National Army, but also continuously attack the provinces and counties that have been taken over by the National Army, destroying transportation and disrupting public security. All kinds of illegal acts are outrageous! The Chinese Communist Army, which claims to be the people's army, cannot take actions that undermine unity and endanger peace. However, the Chinese Communist authorities recently falsely claimed that the National Army in the Northeast is expanding the civil war and attacking the Democratic Allied Forces, which led to the request to extend the order to cease conflict to the Northeast and to increase the dispatch of the execution group to mediate the conflict. This measure is clearly contradictory to the statement by the Chinese Communist Party spokesperson that there are no Communist troops in the Northeast and the agreement that the National Army's entry into the Northeast is unrestricted. Moreover, the results of the Political Consultative Conference have already decided to exclude the Northeast. The one army of the Communist Army in the Northeast recognized in the troop reorganization plan is another issue. This provision cannot be invoked now to carve up the Northeast. Therefore, the situation in the Northeast can only be regarded as the obstruction of the takeover by illegal armed forces, and there is no so-called Kuomintang-Communist conflict. Therefore, the arrival of the execution group in the Northeast is not only unnecessary, but also tantamount to tacitly acknowledging the legal status of the Communist Army in the Northeast, which is truly perplexing. We, the common people of the Northeast, have been occupied for the longest time and have suffered the deepest pain. This victory and restoration is only to seek national unity and complete sovereignty. Therefore, we all long for the National Army to smoothly take over as soon as possible, so as to see the light of day again. If we allow the illegal forces to obstruct and the execution group to mediate, then almost the entire Northeast will be occupied by illegal forces. Even if we seek a political solution, the Northeast may ultimately become special, and the victory of the War of Resistance will be completely erased. Although the government understands the plight of the compatriots in the Northeast who have suffered miserably and is willing to make any concessions in order to restore peace as soon as possible, temporary appeasement will cause long-term harm. It is better to strive for peace with sacrifice than to hope for peace and not get it. Therefore, the compatriots in the Northeast firmly oppose the arrival of the execution group in the Northeast and dare to request that the dispatch be immediately stopped and that the takeover be carried out with the military force of the National Army as soon as possible. Then the country will be fortunate, and the nation will be fortunate! Urgent telegram, hoping for your consideration! Provisional Council, Farmers Association, Chamber of Commerce, Education Association, Women's Association, and Student Union of Suizhong County, Liaoning Province, respectfully kowtow. (Maodong Shen Telegram)</p>
<p>(II)</p>
<p>We lived through fourteen years of suffering under the enslavement and rule of the Japanese puppets. We prayed for liberation and to return to the embrace of our motherland and to see the majesty of our motherland at every moment. The Japanese puppets finally collapsed and surrendered, and we should be able to see the light of day again. However, the Soviet troops have been stationed here for a long time without withdrawing, and bandits have taken the opportunity to run rampant. Our lives, property, and freedom are all without protection. We are still trapped in deep water and scorching fire, living a life of hell on earth.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the Soviet troops are gradually withdrawing, and the National Army is gradually stationed. Wherever the National Army arrives, it becomes a land of light and prosperity. Bandits disappear, and people's lives are stable. However, today, most of the rural areas and remote counties in the Northeast are still rampant with banditry and people are living in misery because the National Army has not yet arrived. The spring plowing season has arrived, and farmers are suffering from displacement. Recently, the Soviet troops are about to completely withdraw as planned. In view of the urgency and complexity of the current situation, we hereby put forward the following appeals based on the mood of the whole country:</p>
<p>First, we demand that the National Army quickly and massively station in all parts of the Northeast to protect the people's lives, property, and freedom.</p>
<p>Second, we demand that the National Army quickly station in any location where the Soviet troops withdraw to stop the bandits from exploiting the people and disrupting public security.</p>
<p>Third, we demand that the National Army quickly suppress the bandits to stabilize social order and prosper the people's lives.</p>
<p>The above three demands are not only the unanimous wishes of the two million people of Shenyang, but also the sincere prayers of the three million compatriots in the Northeast for their early realization. We believe that the sooner the National Army can be stationed, the sooner the people's suffering can be alleviated. If the Soviet troops withdraw completely before the end of April, and our National Army cannot be stationed in large numbers in time, then after April, the people of the Northeast will once again suffer a great catastrophe. Now we are facing a critical moment of our own survival, and we hereby put forward the above urgent appeals. We ask Chairman Chiang and the National Government to give us quick and effective rescue. We hope that the people of the whole country and the just people of the world will give us sympathy and great assistance.</p>

<h3>Shame</h3>
<p>— Xiaoshan</p>
<p>The two words "shame" have a very complex and subtle psychological explanation. According to Professor ____, "shame" and "reaction" are in the same category. It is a representative word, representing singular or plural potential faults and sins, but the "outbreak" (or "execution") of this representative is semi-passive or even purely passive. It is aroused and manifested by ____ kinds of agitation, reflection, and comparison.</p>
<p>In short, shame is a finger, pointing to your dark layer, and you have a certain corresponding performance.</p>
<p>This is the essence of shame.</p>
<p>Let's look at the performance of shame:</p>
<p>We know that in the structure and use of Chinese characters, "shame" (慚) and "guilt" (愧) are different. Shame is "external," guilt is "internal."</p>
<p>To put it bluntly, what is performed on the face is called "shame," and what is performed in the heart is called "guilt." A rush of heat, redness on the face, that's shame! The thumping, chaotic panic in the heart, that's guilt! In other words, the color on the face is called shame, and the lawsuit in the heart is called guilt.</p>
<p>According to normal psychological state, a person with sinful qualities and a criminal record should be self-aware, without necessarily doing any "reaction method." Even if the feeling is a little late, as long as you hear a sarcastic word, your face should react. Or else, give you a direct "question" or "exposure," then your conscience should speak up?</p>
<p>Or, to go further in the opposite direction: flatter you a few words, pat you a few times, and see if your face gets hot! Simply give you an award, and see if your heart can take it?</p>
<p>The problem lies here: it seems that all psychologically normal people have already "passed away"? The living are all "mentally ill patients - extreme psychological deviants" in the mouths of mental health professionals, without the essence and function of shame at all, so how can they have the performance of shame?</p>
<p>No matter if you say I want money, pervert justice, or violate public opinion, we are a face of flesh and a twisted heart!</p>
<p>Come on, flatterers, come on, high hats, come on, we are unashamed to take them, deserving of them!</p>
<p>Therefore, you only see so much "Hahaha!" and hear not the slightest "Sob sob." "Thick-skinned" and "black-hearted" are in power, shame can only go bankrupt!</p>

<h3>For the Sake of Living</h3>
<p>— Cong Jun</p>
<p>"For the sake of living," many people use this phrase as a cover for lewd and shameless deeds. "For the sake of living," many others are inspired to improve their lives and complete solemn and sacred work.</p>
<p>Gorky, in a novel, wrote about two people with different personalities, both of whom could be said to be "for the sake of living." One person, in order to solve the problem of living, willingly degenerated and wandered down the wrong path. The other person, also in order to solve the problem of living, was motivated by the idea of "life" and resolutely took on the responsibility of fighting for human survival. The two characters formed a perfect contrast.</p>
<p>In today's society, people with weak wills, especially pure young men and women, are unable to withstand the impact of the turbid waves of society. Many young people, in order to satisfy their desire to survive, are involuntarily swept into the turbulent waves, and from then on, they flow into the vortex of depravity. For the sake of living, everyone can forgive them, because survival is the greatest desire of mankind. However, it is also for the sake of living that no one can forgive them, because there are many ways to survive, and they must not blindly follow the crowd and be willing to fall.</p>
<p>Some people say that prostitutes who sell their smiles are selling their bodies to earn a living. I say that those who use any means, using "for the sake of living" as a grandiose excuse, and indulging in the dark side of society, are selling their souls to earn a living. Many traitors who sell themselves for glory are willing to act as accomplices of tigers, disregarding the nation and the country. Their motivation for joining the enemy is also "for the sake of living." Of course, there are also many people who are able to maintain a minimum standard of living who lose their way because they hope to obtain higher material enjoyment. However, why don't they think that "for the sake of living," there are many paths to take? Why collude with the enemy? Why be used by bandits? No matter what, the phrase "for the sake of living" cannot cover up their crimes. Survival is important, but maintaining a noble ideal and personality is even more important. If a person loses their ideals for living, or if their personality is lost, even if they are still alive in the world, they can only be regarded as walking corpses, without a soul.</p>
<p>The great thinker Romain Rolland said: "Why do we live in the world? Our life is not for ourselves, but for mankind." The strong desire of mankind to survive proves that the individual should bear a heavy responsibility to society—sacrificing one's own happiness for the survival of others. Individuals are destined to die sooner or later, while the entire human race continues endlessly. If we want to make human society continue to evolve and make social life not perish with the individual, we must transform the "small self" into the "big self," and contribute all personal wisdom, talent, and energy to society, and cultivate the growth and development of the "big self." The meaning of life lies in improving the lives of all mankind, and the value of life lies in continuing the lives of all mankind. It is definitely not just to live in the world to solve the problems of food, clothing, housing, and transportation.</p>
<p>"For the sake of living," we have to work, which is very true. But there is something we must consider first: I want to live, and others want to live too. Does living for myself affect the lives of others? Does my own benefit hinder the benefits of others? Individuals live in groups, and the development of individuals must take into account the group. People who truly understand the meaning of life not only do not harm the interests of others, but even sacrifice their own interests for the happiness of others. Inspired by the phrase "for the sake of living," they first endure all kinds of hardships and sufferings in life, fight with life, and constantly improve their awareness of life. Along with "for the sake of living," they also think of "for mankind."</p>
<p>"For the sake of living," we do not seek life, nor do we covet life. On the contrary, we must also value the value of life, but if we must sacrifice our own lives for the happiness of mankind, we do not covet life either. We would rather die to preserve our personality than live with our personality stained with filth. A shameful life is not as good as a glorious death. Living in peace is not as good as dying in struggle.</p>
<p>Also, there are many people in society who, because they lack a good upbringing in life, only care about satisfying their desire to survive, and neglect the highest ideals of life. The degeneration of some people is due to the fact that their standards of living enjoyment cannot be lowered for a while, which leads to their hearts being obscured and their actions being flawed. The power of possessiveness that drives people to the path of depravity is indeed great. The lives of ordinary people belong to sensation, and they only pursue sounds, colors, flavors, and tastes, lacking the element of will. People who are independent and unique in ancient and modern times, both in China and abroad, face the real society with a spirit of perseverance and an unyielding will. Failures and difficulties are not enough to shake their determination. They always use their belief in life to carry out their ideas. As a result, they succeed and achieve final victory in the battle of life.</p>
<p>"For the sake of living," we should cultivate a belief in life and live our own lives. On the one hand, we must enrich our knowledge and skills in application so that we have the ability to adapt to various aspects of life. On the other hand, we must recognize the greatest meaning of life, understand the relationship between the individual and the group, and complete the task of self-education through hard training, and realize the highest ideals of life.</p>
<p>Driven by a strong desire to survive, we can take many paths. However, be aware and don't let our need "for the sake of living" cause our personality to suffer the slightest flaw.</p>
<p>"For the sake of living," we must choose a correct path!</p>

<h3>Songjiang in Mud and Slush</h3>
<p>— Chen Mianyu</p>
<p>If you are an outsider, the first impression you will get when you step into Songjiang these days will be the muddy and slushy roads. The roads are made of loess, which turns into mud in rainy days, and because they are uneven, there are many puddles. Occasionally, a truck drives by, and you have to try to avoid it, otherwise arrow-like mud will splatter all over your coat. Therefore, everyone always curses the road on rainy days, but after the weather clears up, everyone puts this matter behind them. In fact, the road is also flawed on sunny days, especially when the summer climate is very dry and the northwest wind is very strong in winter. Sometimes you will wonder if you are in a heavy fog. There is so much yellow dust that you can't comfortably open your eyes on the road, and it's strange if sand doesn't blow in.</p>
<p>Secondly, everything, including drinks and washing, relies on the river. The water is always yellow, and vegetable peels, foreign bottles, and rags can be used for an exhibition. Especially after the tide recedes, a stream of black water flows trickling like a sewer. I'm not lying, sometimes there really is a nauseating stench.</p>
<p>Recently, someone launched a project to dredge the river, which seems to give people a glimmer of hope. The dredging fee of 4,000 yuan per person for each store has been collected almost entirely, and then the slogan has gradually faded away. The hot summer is coming soon, and I am really worried about the people of Songjiang. When epidemics run rampant in the hot weather, what kind of threat will the turbid and filthy river water pose to their health? It is imperative to start construction quickly now.</p>
<p>The city houses of Songjiang are almost as dilapidated as the river. From the west gate to Malu Bridge, even the most prosperous section is not neat. Here, you can see three-story buildings, but you can also find low-rise houses with protruding eaves and bald roofs. There are many Western-style facades that resemble screens, and the high and low buildings conceal the simplicity, but they are dangerous when there is a fire or wind.</p>
<p>Therefore, some people say that roads, rivers, and houses are the three movements of Songjiang's dilapidation, which is indeed true.</p>
<p>Speaking of the business district of Songjiang, it is only a short section outside the west gate. The city was bombed by the enemy during the Anti-Japanese War, leaving only dilapidated walls. It is still the same now, with only a few residences and several institutions trying to create a lively atmosphere. Therefore, it can be said that Songjiang is really only a section outside the west gate, and only Malu Bridge to the west gate is relatively lively, which is the essence.</p>
<p>But the urban area is quite vast, stretching three or four miles from east to west. Therefore, rickshaws have their place under these conditions. At least until there is a means of transportation that is simpler and more convenient to replace them, they will not be eliminated. However, the rickshaws here are by no means as neat as we imagine. Not only does the body of the car shake from side to side, but the wheels are also covered with a lot of broken ropes and rags, which is also uncomfortable for your eyes. Less than one-tenth of them are pleasing to the eye.</p>
<p>Even the electric lights in Songjiang are not very satisfactory. It is true that the lights are dim and often malfunction. If the coal runs out, the movie theater will have to take a temporary "five-minute break." Usually, kerosene lamps and vegetable oil lamps are used as backup, otherwise you will inevitably suffer.</p>
<p>Comparatively speaking, education is still lively. In the morning and evening, there are many students walking on the road. However, this is limited to one class. The knowledge level of ordinary merchants is very low. The most complete bookstores here are "Spring Ends and Dreams Break" and "Sanmen Street," although there are also a few copies of "Midnight" to make up the numbers.</p>
<p>A bookstore clerk told me that in the past, only three or four copies of ×× Poetry Journal were sold in Songjiang each issue. How pathetic! It is no wonder that the bookshelves have become the world of ×× Weekly and ×× Weekly, which have the style of past tabloids.</p>
<p>Currently, there are three local newspapers: Rong Bao, Youth Daily, and Daguanming Daily. They are all printed by printing houses, but the degenerated supplements and the narrow news network have not achieved any significant results. Among them, the Youth Daily is still a more respectable newspaper. The only other publication is the Youth Monthly, which supports the literary scene in Songjiang, but it is thin in quality, only four pages wide, and has a small circulation. Moreover, it has no distinct style. Originally, there were two publications with little difference: Vocational Youth and Female Youth, but they died recently due to two fatal injuries: rising paper prices and high printing costs.</p>
<p>The so-called literary scene is like the road here on rainy days, mired in mud and slush. In fact, where in Songjiang is not muddy and slushy? Half a year after the victory, everything remains the same. Open your eyes, where is not stuck in mud and slush?</p>
<p>Random Thoughts</p>
<h3>Banknotes Flying Everywhere</h3>
<p>— Jin Ding</p>
<p>On the road, you can often see small-denomination legal tender and counterfeit banknotes with a face value of 5,000 or 10,000 yuan, trampled on by people. Even the "rickshaw pullers" ignore them. "Banknotes flying everywhere," who says people are living in misery? Or that there is widespread suffering?</p>
<p>In the streets and alleys of the countryside, we can also often see the same situation. Some people use five-yuan and ten-yuan CRB notes as toilet paper, or as decorations for wallpapering. "Banknotes flying everywhere," who says rural areas are bankrupt and need relief?</p>
<p>Everywhere shows the scene of "banknotes flying everywhere." Is this not picking up lost things? Or is it the land of gentlemen?</p>

<h3>Answering Readers</h3>
<p>Da Shuan asks: A friend of mine, Mr. So-and-so, used to live in Nanshi. He was bombed in October 1944. Mr. So-and-so has an elder brother who lives in the former French Concession and is also a second-hand landlord. He has spare rooms but refuses to take him in. Mr. So-and-so discussed this with me. I valued friendship and resolutely let him live with me. At first, I did not expect that Mr. So-and-so's wife was a madwoman. She has a loud voice and sings wildly, or hits metal objects like drumming. She scolds people for no reason, day and night. Although her mind is confused, her speech seems clear. The neighbors are suffering, but Mr. So-and-so ignores it. What should I do?</p>
<p>Lawyer Duanben Kai answers: Since it interferes with the tranquility of residence, you can ask him to move out.</p>
<p>Zhou Jin-gen asks: My late father passed away nineteen years ago. At that time, he left 30,000 yuan in cash and a piece of farmland. Before my late father passed away, he told my uncle: the cash should be given to the eldest son, and the farmland in a certain place should be given to the youngest son (i.e., me). Who knew that my uncle (now deceased) actually induced my elder brother to sell the farmland that I was supposed to get to someone else? At that time, I was working as an apprentice in a factory, so I didn't know about it. Now I plan to apply to the court for (1) the invalidity of the sales contract; (2) my elder brother is responsible for all the losses of the buyer; (3) I don't know the buyer's address, can I apply to the court for a public announcement to serve as public notice?</p>
<p>Lawyer Duanmu Kai answers: If there is sufficient proof, you can claim the invalidity of the sales contract. If the location of the buyer is unknown, you can apply to the court for public notice.</p>

<h3>Letter from Gongji Hospital</h3>
<p>"Regarding the news of a poor pregnant woman in our hospital giving birth to triplets, since it was published in your esteemed newspaper, enthusiastic people from all walks of life have inquired and donated money, for which we are deeply grateful. These triplet twins have many difficulties in raising them, so they are still being cared for in our hospital, with doctors and nurses taking good care of them. We plan to have their family members take them back after they are one year old. All expenses within the period will be borne by our hospital. However, we still hope that enthusiastic people will donate clothing. We are deeply grateful for this. As for cash donations, our hospital will not accept them. Please contact the family members of the triplets directly. We hereby inform you of this and wish you well."</p>
<h3>Donations for "Triplet Twins"</h3>
<p>Yesterday, this column received 20,000 yuan on behalf of Mrs. Cao, No. 32 Yong'an Li, North Sichuan Road, and 5,000 yuan from Wu Song. The previous balance was 37,900 yuan, bringing the total to 62,900 yuan.</p>
<h3>Symbol Stolen and Voided</h3>
<p>Editor: I am from Yuyao and work for the Jinshan County Government. I came to Shanghai on official business. This morning (7th), at the entrance of the Dashin Company, my team leader symbol, a self-defense armband, and a dispatch order of Xiangxiang team, Zhangyan District, Jinshan County Self-Defense Brigade were stolen. There were also two important letters. In addition to applying to the Jinshan County Government for re-issuance, if any kind person picks them up, please notify the Military Section of the Jinshan County Government. I will be very grateful. Qi Zu</p>
