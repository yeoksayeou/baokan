<h3>以劍及屨及精神　完成復員與建設　蔣主席在參政會政詞全文</h3>
<p>〔中央社重慶廿日電〕蔣主席廿日上午在參政會四屆二次大會開幕式中致詞，全文如下：</p>
<p>主席。各位參政員先生：</p>
<p>今天是第四屆參政會第二次大會集會的第一日，經過了多時的闊別，本席又得與各位聚首一堂，甚爲快慰。我們參政會對於擁護抗戰國策，協助抗戰成功，其貢獻是特別偉大。我在今天要向貴會首先表示的，我們八年抗戰，全國同跑和全體官兵，流血犧牲，對於國家民族的貢獻，固將永華於不朽，此外，還有兩點，是達成我們持久抗戰成功的重要因素，第一，就是我們參政會在抗戰期間團結意志，集中力量，不辭任何艱難，擁護抗戰到底的國策始終不渝，以底於成。其次，我不能不提到抗戰重要根據地的四川，所貢獻的人力最多，物力最大，而重慶男女老幼同胞忍受敵寇最猛烈的轟炸，不惜犧牲一切生命財產，與政府同生死共甘苦，百折不撓，再接再厲，其可歌可泣的志節，眞足以動天地而泣鬼神，這都是將來抗戰史上値得大書特書的功績，亦是本席所親身經歷而沒齒難忘的，因此，在抗戰勝利結束以後的今天，我要表示對四川省同胞的感佩，我更要對參政會致最高的敬意。</p>
<p>上次參政會大會舉行於去年七七紀念日，本席當時曾以爭取民族自由，維護國家獨立，加速敵寇崩潰，樹立憲政規模的重大使命，對貴會致深切的期望。上次大會開會不久，日本無條件投降了，我們抗戰終於得到勝利的結束，現在所尚未完成的，就是復曼善後，恢復交通，安定地方，解除人民痛苦和實施憲政，完成建國工作的問題。這次貴會集會，於抗戰勝利結束之後，又正在召開國民大會，制頒憲法，實施憲政以前，意義是特別重大，而任務也特別艱巨。</p>
<p>政府各部門的行政措施，主管各部門當向貴會報吿，本席所要向貴會提出的，是國家在戰後所處的環境與復員工作的進行，本席在抗戰結束以前，就常說戰後的工作較之戰時將更爲艱難，我們作戰時間這樣長久，作戰地帶的損害如此慘重，一旦復員，要將戰時體制改變爲平時，要將經過大破壞大損害的人力物力地力蘇復過來，要將久受敵僞蹂躪的地方回復秩序，已是千頭萬緒，工作紛繁，何况還要遭受內在的各種障碍和困難，首先是軍令政令不能完全統一，其次是復員要件的交通設備，勝利前後都受了嚴重的破壞，而其間不瞭解政府處境和苦心的，又用種種方法，阻撓復員工作的推進，又加上復員所需要的人才準備和物資準備不無欠缺，致使復員工作曠日持久，不能圓滿進行。我們全國人民，在戰後所受的痛苦，諸如災荒遍地，物價高漲，地方不安寗，生活無保障，流離的不能還鄉，有業者不能樂業，在若十地帶竟較之戰時更爲嚴重，眞所謂如水益深，如火益　，這實在是最可痛心的現象。政府爲了拯救人民的痛苦，確保勝利的成果，認爲復員和建設需要有和平安定的環境，需要有全國一致的努力，因之，一方面在人力才力萬分困難的情形之下，竭盡一分可能，排除一切障碍，來推動復員工作。另一方面，尤其不得不委曲求全，容忍退讓，用政治的方法，達成國家的和平統一，使各方面的異見趨於和洽，人爲的困難和障碍得以消除，更因爲鍳於抗戰期內痛苦之深，犧牲之重，情勢之危，以及戰後立國的艱難，政府深深覺得，應該以劍及置及的精神，於最短期內開始一切建設，使中國成爲一個和平統一民主富强的現代國家，非如此不足以厠身於國際社會之林。政府這種對整個國家，整個民族負責任的苦心孤詣，當爲今日在座各位先生所深切領會，而衷誠維護的。</p>
<p>基於上述的目標，政府在抗戰結束以後，就致力於和平統一的工作，尤其着重於團結意志，集中力量的工作，使各黨各派及社會賢達均有參預國政的機會，同時對於國民大會的召集，務使其圓滿進行，政府本年一月間有政治協商會議的召集，對於政府組織，和平建國綱領，整軍方案，憲草及有關國民大會召集事項等五大問題，都有了開誠的商討，就是要開啓和平建國的途徑。停止軍事衝突，恢復交通命令的頒布，軍事調處執行部的成立，以及軍事三人小組關於軍隊整編及統編共軍爲國軍的基本方案的訂定，也無不循着這一個目標而進行。雖然當前的現象對於國家和平統一的目標還存在着不少的困難，但是我們中國如果要獨立生存於世界，要保持困苦抗戰的成果，本席敢言，上述的方針，是與常時持久抗戰的國策同等重要，必須全國一致，以最大的忍耐，最大的誠意，排除萬難，以促其成功的。</p>
<p>中國今日最大的要求和全體人民最迫切的需要，無過於復員善後之完成與建設工作之開始，抗戰勝利到現在，已經有七個月了，復員善後建設工作，絕不容再有任何的阻碍和躭誤，人民的痛苦和地方的擾亂，更必須迅速予以解除，因之，政府現時所欲致力之重點，在對內方面是（甲）恢復全國秩序，解除人民痛苦，穩定經濟，安定民生，以開始經濟建設。（乙）力求停止軍事衝突及恢復交通命令之全部貫澈與軍事三人小組所商定整軍基本方案之實施，使軍令政令得以統一，全國同胞得有休養生息之機會。（丙）五月五日召開國民大會，必須如期舉行，以達成我們多年來實施憲政的夙願。至於對國際關係上說，我們必須貫澈抗戰初志，力求國家領土主權行政之元整，誠意履行與各盟邦所已訂立之條約，擁護聯合國憲章。促成國際合作，以鞏固世界和平。凡此四者，皆係針對國內外情勢之發展與夫根據全國上下普遍一致的要求而決定，貴會在憲政實施以前，實爲全國最高的民意機關，亦是最能表達人民公意的唯一機關，希望觀察國家當前的環境，對於上述各點與以一致的協助。</p>
<p>本席還要特別提出的，在貴會上次開會後，這八個月中間，駐會參政員實有最大的貢獻，在戰事結束以後，國內外局勢均有極多的變化，政府在道期間的一切肆應，也就特別的繁重而艱鉅，但參政會與政府之間的密切聯繫，却是始終一貫，不但絲毫沒有間隔，而始終匡輔政府補正不少的缺點。在貴會閉會期間，各位駐會參政員對於政府的措施，隨時作客觀而眞切的檢討，貢獻賓貴的意見。政府方面也常將施政上的重要事項，向駐會參政員提出報吿，聽取批評，此種密切合作眞誠孚洽的精神，已爲我國將來實施憲政，奠立了良好的規模，比之西方各國議會與政府之間的關係，可謂已無愧色，實在應該繼續保持而發揚光大的。</p>
<p>最後，本席要懇切的向各位提供幾點具體坦白的意見，檢討歷次參政會的建議，政府方面凡是可以採納的，無不切實執行，這一次會議，正在戰事結束復員未完的期間來舉行，國家的建設和地方的秩序，有待改進和恢復的事項，必不在少。各位參政員此次集合陪都，來自各方，聞見較切，所要建議的事項，也必更爲宏大，政府準備接納嘉言，以濟國家的艱危，解人民的痛苦。政府希望貴會的，一切決議全部見之實施，因此，本席希望於本次大會的：（甲）把握重點，多作積極具體的建議。（乙）注意現實，以貢獻實際可行，而且行之必成的辦法。（丙）地方困苦的解除，惟有從全國安定發展中求之。參政會是全國性的民意機關，各位不僅是代表一個地區或一種職業，而實是代表全國的人民，所以關於解除地方痛苦與增進地方福利的一切建議，都要顧及國家整個利益與實際情况，權衡其輕重緩急之所宜，而發抒讜論，提供方案。以上三事，本席特代表政府轉達此種誠懇的期望，竚待各位貢獻其宏謨，並望指陳缺點，俾政府各部鬥得以洞悉民隱，力求改進，而善盡其職責，謹祝貴會成功和各位先生的健康。</p>

<h3>美對華信用貸款　進出口銀行宣布核准五項　總數達三千三百餘萬美元</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓十九日電〕進出口銀行今日宣布：該行董事會已在原則上初步核准對華信用貸款五項，總數合計三千三百七十九萬三千七百五十美元。至貸款細則正在談判中，預料將於數星期內竣事，中國得利用該項信用貸款，在美購買少數船隻，補助電力廠，修理鐵路及煤礦用之原料及工具。該項貸欽分配如下：（一）四，二四三，七五〇元，作爲向海事委員會購買沿海貨船十艘之用。（二）二，六〇〇，〇〇〇元，用以購買前由陸軍運輸部管理之沿海貨船十六艘，其中十一艘爲戰時船舶管理處之私產。（三）六五〇，〇〇〇元，用以購買修理鐵路工具·（四）八，八〇〇，〇〇〇元，用以購置五千基羅瓦特補助電力廠十單位。（五）一，五〇〇，〇〇〇元，用以購買開採煤礦用工具。上項各項貸款期限長短不一。該進出口銀行又宣布：中國銀行業已與該行簽訂協定，由中國政府保證，成立三千三百萬美元信用貸款，以購買美棉，供國營及民營紗廠業之用。此項信用貸款，係由該行董事會於一月十七日加以核准者。</p>
<p>美棉借款亦成立　紡給業原料無虞</p>
<p>據本日宣布：貸款期限大致與該行對歐洲各國棉花貸款相同，利率爲二厘半，淸償時期為美棉運抵中國以後廿四個月，因中國內地運輸所需時間較長，故較對歐洲貸款延長九個月。該進出口銀行復宣稱：該項貸款數額，可購美棉二七五，〇〇〇至三〇〇，〇〇〇包，約可供給中國棉布五萬萬碼。　　〔本報南京廿日電〕政息，美進出口銀行貸我大宗信用借款及美棉偕疑成立後，復與中國紡織業之原料問題，即可迎刃而解。因目前中國接收日人經營之紡織工業，需要適合織造細布之巨量美棉甚爲股切，在今後五年內，中國仍須倚賴大宗美棉輸入，方能改良中國布疋織造之成品，而滿足人民衣被所需之要求。中國在陝西。河南·江蘇等省，擁有希望無窮之棉田，惜現在泰半荒廢。</p>

<p>〔本報廣州廿日電〕此間發生類似上海之白爾丁號事件，因被列爲戰犯之前法維琪政府駐粤領事西門，現爲現任法領事藏匿，不允交出審訊。據行營方面訊，西門危害盟國作戰各械證據，經於去年底搜集，當時法領事館秘書勞革代理領事負責和留，幷保證隨時解交我方審訊，詎於十五日行營循正當外交途徑，派員到沙面法領事館，請其交出西門’惟法領事衛映章竟歷次拒絕，並謂西門仍有其領事資格，與普通戰犯不同，奉法政府令，我方審訊。我方以法領如此表示，殊不友誼，且認爲此旣屬盟國之領館，實不應包庇盟岡之共同戰犯，故防西門逃走，祇有派兵將該領事館保護。</p>

<h3>吳鐵城談全會觀感　糾正中共曲解決議</h3>
<p>〔中央社重慶慶日電〕二中全會閉幕，記者特往訪中央黨部秘書長吳鐵氏城，問答如下：</p>
<p>問：秘書長對於此次全會之觀感如何？</p>
<p>答：此次全會討論國家當前各問題，其熱烈周詳，爲過去所未有，大會主要精神，已有各種決議，並扼要列人宣言，總而言之，即在集中全國力最，完成和平那建國之使命。</p>
<p>問：今日新華日　發表中共發言人之談話，與周恩來先生之談話，認爲二中全會的決議，動搖了政治協商的決議，秘書長意見如何？</p>
<p>答：余對此二談話內容，甚爲詫異，不知其用意何在，政治協商會議爲政府所召集，政府對其決議，正在着手實施，二中全會對政協報吿加以確認，且亦已有明確之決議，政府不僅將實行決議，且切望中共遵守決議·至於憲法問題，仍在審議時期，二中全會所提出之意見，亦正由政府代表，向憲草審議會提出，徵求各方之意見。本黨認憲法爲革命之目標，關係國家大計，不能不愼重考慮，且政治協商會議原有了解，如有較好意見，可提出共同協商。</p>
<p>問：周因來先生認爲國民政府委員，不應由中央執行委員會選任，秘書長有何意見？</p>
<p>答：依照訓政時期的法，國民政府委員應由本黨中央執行委員會選任，政治協商會議關於擴夫政府組織之決議，附註內明白指出，國府委員山『國民政府主席提請選在」，當時共同了解，即係由本黨車夾執行委員會選任，只須參閱政協決議原文，即可明瞭，周恩來先生談話，似故意誤解，頗爲遺憾，吾則「提請選任」字樣，不知將作如何解釋。</p>
<p>問：周恩來先生談話認爲國防最高委員會改爲中央政治委員會，爲「對於政治最高指導機關」，是要指導「國民政府」，此言是否確實？</p>
<p>答：國防最高委員會之職權，已劃歸國府委員會，中央政治委員會完全係爲本黨指導黨員政治之最高機關，並非指導政府，共產黨亦有政治局之機構，周恩來先生談話，顯係曲解，故意使人誤會。</p>
<p>問：周恩來先生又謂全會對人權問題，一字未題，國大組織法還未修改，加以責難，秘書長以爲如何？</p>
<p>答：凡政府決定實行之事，日無再作決議必要，戰時限制人民自由之法令，已在分別廢止修改中，國大組織法，政府正在依法送由立法院修正。</p>
<p>問：周恩來先生又謂國軍不遵停戰協定，並引林鄭二先生之言爲證，確否？</p>
<p>答：何方不遵停戰協定，爲全國人民所共兌共聞，各地軍事調處小組，亦均有報吿，余希望中共說眞話，做實事。</p>
<p>問：周恩來先生謂，二中全會中軍政部林次長報吿軍隊人數與其在政協報吿人數不符，又謂，其報吿部隊復員計劃，違反政協決議及軍事三人小組整軍方案，秘書長以爲確否？</p>
<p>答：國軍現有四百九十萬人，（去年十二月份統計）除各軍事機關學校及海空軍共一百一十萬人外，陸軍部份共有三百八十萬人，國軍停止徼兵後，逃亡消耗，勢所難免，故佔計復員人數，不能以十足計算。原報吿佔計今後十二個月之消耗率，最少限爲百分之十五，即應减去五十七萬人，實有陸軍人數，應照三百二十三萬人計算，國軍第一期整編完成時，保留官兵一百八十萬人，編爲三十個軍九十個師及特種兵勤務等部隊，其應復員轉業人數爲一百四十三萬人，（內官長十八萬兵一百二十五萬）共爲三百二十三萬人，故在政協會報吿軍隊人數三百八十萬人，及二中全會報吿總人數四百九十萬人，輿部隊復員計劃綱要所列轉業人數一百四十十三中萬人，前後核計，並無錯誤。又原綱要所列第二期轉業人數六十五萬人，亦本此原則而計算者，至眾政部部隊復員計劃，定全部復員期間爲十八個月，第一期十二個月，復員到九十個師，第二期六個月，再復員到五十個師，此皆嚴格信守軍事三人小組整軍方案‘至所謂兵工建設總隊，乃是編餘官兵無法取得職業者，從水於治河。修路。造林。墾荒。依政治協商會議和平建國綱領第四款第五條之規定，「政府應籌劃編餘及退伍官兵之復業與就業」，兵工建設，即爲此種籌劃之一種，絕不能誤會視爲獨立性之武力·周恩來先生之曲解，無須深辯而且明·</p>
<p>問：如秘書長所說二中全會，並毫無動搖政治協商決議之意，何以中共忽作此大規模宣傳攻勢！</p>
<p>答：此事最好去問中共發言人與周恩來先生，余可以相告者，中共每一大規模宣傳攻勞，即緊接一新行動，今日中共宣傳攻勢之後，將有何種新行動發生，未可預料，試就東北問題之發展及統編方案之實施兩事，加以注意，或可觀察其動向。</p>
<h3>爪哇戰事復作印荷談判中止</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦二十日廣播：原定今日舉行之荷印與印度尼西亞談判，突吿中止。在爪哇北岸三賓瓏一帶，英荷軍隊與印度尼西亞部隊發生激烈砲戰。巴達維亞迤南，印度尼西亞部隊亦向印軍進攻，泗水一帶印度尼西亞軍隊以坦克及大砲進攻英軍。</p>

<h3>印度爭取自由　機運成熟　已氣蓬勃已無法控制尼赫魯盼英放棄統治</h3>
<p>〔路透社新加坡二十日電〕尼赫魯午夜在此招待記者發表談，的歷兩小時之久。記者詢以印度是否願意接受自治領之地位？尼氏謂，印度第一步欲取得完全之自由，如選擇朋友及同志之自由等，完全自由取得以後，始再決定是否將留在不列顚共和邦以內。尼氏又謂，印度人完全同情印度尼西亞之人民，故印度軍之在印度尼西亞，殊使印度之人民感覺憤慨。記者詢以對英內閣使命團之赴印，是否樂觀？答曰，余覺今日有强大之力量，正迫使英國承認印度之自由，聰明之人，均知把持印度，已逐漸失去利益，反而成爲一種負担，自由旣已來臨，遠見之士均欲以最妥之方法使其實現，不可予以阻止，以防發生反響。凡此種種，均可預示下次談判中，能產生滿意的結果。然今日英人仍不乏以印度之地主自居者，行政常局僅知徵集錢帑，維持法律與秩序，從不注意世界之進展，以及飢荒之原因。而英國政府之計劃，即係本於此等行政當局之報吿而擬具，許多人民對於英國政府已完全喪失信仰，不信此次使命團能有若何之結果·民衆之反感，已至難以控制之地步，飢荒之發生，亦係當局處置不當之故，故大會黨決不願接受英國之統治，但與英國利益有關之若干事件，吾人仍願與其成立協定。以言馬來亞之印度人，余祗可重申前此向緬甸錫蘭等地印人提出之意見，此等國家內之印度人，當依法選擇是吾願爲該國國民或印度國民。尼氏復謂，印度洋區各國將遂漸結成更密切之關係，包括澳大利亞在內，印度自將爲其中心云。</p>

<h3>開明民族政策的重申</h3>
<p>中國國民黨二中全會，於十九次大會席上，通過一件重要的決議案，其文曰：「查我蒙·藏·回三族同胞，俱爲構成我大中華民族之一員，而其分布之地區，更爲我領土不可分之一部。本黨之於各邊疆同胞，向本扶助發展之旨，携手邁進，期其共臻於富强康樂之境。……今抗戰勝利，建國之責任，應由我全國同胞共同負之。本大會爲木斯旨，將有關各案詳加審查決議，特就各案之精神，及報吿檢討之要點，決定左列數端，期其迅速實施，以達成國內各民族之團結統一，而奠國家長治久安之基：（一）在根據三民主義。五權憲法組成統一民主國家之原則下，憲法中須有明白規定保障邊疆民族之自治權利，（二）改組後之國府委員及行政院之政務委員中均須有蒙。蔽。回三族忠實幹練之同志參加；（三）蒙·藏。回三族賢能人士，須有充分機會參加各院部會實際工作；（四）於新增之國民大會代表各額中，酌增蒙·藏·回三族代表名額，由中央推選之；（五）改組蒙藏委員會爲邊政部，使蒙·藏·回三族幹練人士得參加實際工作，祖負實際責任；（六）在邊疆民族所在地各級之施敎，應注重本族文字，並以國文爲必修科，由敎育部斟酌施行，各級機關之行文，以國文及本族文字並用爲原則；（七）中央對於邊疆各地自治制度，須按照各該地實際情形，作合理之規定：（（甲）關於內蒙部份，恢復原有之蒙古地方自治政務委員會；並明白劃分盟旗政府與省縣間之權限；（乙）關於新疆部份，應按照解決新疆省事變所定之辦法實行；（丙）關於省屬藏族部份，應予以確實參加省縣政治之機會；（八）關於邊疆各地之經濟。交通·敎育·衛生·救濟各項事業，應加撥專款，責成各該主管機關擬定實施方案，迅予推行；（九）國防軍駐屯邊疆民族所在各地，應集中於數衝要地區，糧秣由中央供給，不干涉地方行政，所有地方保安隊，應以編訓本族及本地人民充任爲原則」。</p>
<p>上列這個決議案關係相當重要，特別在今天，各地少數民族往往被煽動而在進行着所謂「自主」運動的時候。中國境內沒有像出現在其它地方那樣的所謂「少數民族」，這在我國當局早已一再闡明，本次國民黨二中全會對我常局所持的堅定政策爲扼要的重申，開宗明義，就說：「查我蒙·藏·回三族同胞，俱爲構成我大中華民族之一員：」，可知蒙·藏·回同胞同是我大中華民族的構成份子，而不是我大中華民族外的「少數民族」。這一點是我們整個民族政策的核心。我大中華民族彷彿是一個大家庭，蒙·藏·回等同胞，俱是構成這大家庭的份子。各構成份子，情同手足，都有維持這大家庭的責任。</p>
<p>然而各構成份子各因其歷史地理的因素，往往凝成其獨有的生沽定型與文化特徵，我們若欲共拋棄他們固有的文化生活而强其從同，就歷史的觀點言，不特未能收其實效，抑且容易招致反動；而且更有背於我們建國的最高指導原則三民主義的和平中正的理想。這次國民黨二中全會的決議，於擴大邊地同胞參加中樞的機會外，着重在扶殖邊地同胞的自治，與維護邊地同胞的固有文化生活，不特足以表示中央對邊地同胞的關注，抑亦爲他們此後的發展開拓了一條大道·「在邊疆民族所在地各級之施敎，應注重本族文字，…中央對於邊疆各地自治制度，須按照各該地實際情形，作合理之規定」。凡上所言，俱可見我中央如何在堅持統一之中，維護他們原有的生活定型與文化特徵。這實是極明智的決定。因此決議，我國的民族政策愈益明顯，而應爲世所欽祟。這政策在消極方面的意義，是我們摒棄了具有侵略意味的同化政策；在積極方面，我們的民族政策是在扶殖邊地同胞的自我發展，而允注意於他們固有文化的發育。今日在世界各處正進行着「少數民族」的離心分化運動，我們於此際將我們開明的民族政策予以重申，可謂極得其時。</p>
<p>於此，我們須咖補充的，就是我們的民族政策，雖以蒙·藏·回同胞爲主要對象，但散居在西南的各種『夾族」以及聚居在台灣的番族，雖文化水準容或未高，但我們之對於他們，亦視同手足一樣，爲我大中華民族的構成份子。如何提高他們的生活水準與增進他們的福利，今中央有設立邊政部的決議，深信將來旣有機稱專司其事，必能妥爲進行。我大中華民族各構成份子，於戰時同舟同濟，今國家踏上建國大道，允須携手　進，以共臻富强康樂境域：瞻念前途，實有厚望。</p>
<h3>草根樹皮充飢　中國待賬孔亟　我代表蔣廷黻特發出呼籲</h3>

<p>〔合衆社大西洋城二十日電〕蔣廷黻在會議中宣稱，暹羅有存米二百五十萬噸，但因政治上之原因，未能裝出。蔣氏並謂，遠東方面食米之缺乏，可使數百萬人民喪生。</p>

<h3>今日之金元王國！　物物感缺乏游資獨充斥　較六年前多二百倍</h3>
<p>〔聯合社紐的十九日電〕美國於一九四六年內無ｇ　物不感缺乏，獨於資金一項則吾，以致游資充斥，放款利息之低爲歷史上所未有。數十億元游資不能獲得出路，使利率日益减低。此項游資用以購買消費物品者爲數甚少，以各貨存底不豐，供不應求。各戲院，夜總會，及娛塲所成有人滿之患，零售商生意興隆，搜購各項貨品及作其他投資者，日益增多，足徵游資充斥。此外股票債劵購者亦多，以致各種證劵尋求甚難。游資充斥結果，使美國經濟各部門，處境日益窘困，銀行，保險公司及信託公司等金融機關均激烈反對財部所持之低利率政策，惟一部份公司則對此種政策表示歡迎，因可藉此以低利率發行債票或淸償舊債，政府因發行巨量公債，每年需支付利息，自亦歡迎此項政策。美國公債總數的爲三千億美元，每年約須付息二分，即爲六十億美元，如將利率提高至四分，則每年付出利息將達一百二十萬，竟等於一九一八年美國所發行公債之總數。</p>
<p>美國現有游資據估計比一九三九年多二百倍，現金及可流通之證劵總數達二千五百億美元，約四倍於一九二九年之數，債券格價續向上漲，持有人所獲利息實屬無幾。</p>

<p>費氏在滬淪陷期內，即脫離電影事業，而從事話劇編導，後仍日人威迫，故又退息，至今已一年餘。費氏最近深居簡出，擬編寫一電影劇本。但據其本人表示，搜索題材頗爲因難。費氏爲人謙和，連稱須重新多多學習，過去作品，並無所成，不願提起。費氏爲此劇本，苦心研究，盼於本年夏秋之前，有一出品貢獻大衆。</p>

<h3>棉紗止跌轉漲　紡建續有開出　疋頭銷路萎靡</h3>
<p>昨日紗市反動上漲，緣綿綿之春雨，忽然轉晴，銷路因是開展，紗價乃得止跌轉漲，廿支雙馬回升至一百十二萬，收市較昨獨高十萬之　，其他各支紗均回好三五萬元，聞日內有船直放廣東，是以粤帮納胃頗勁。</p>
<p>紡紡建公司昨繼續開售呢蔴嗶嘰絹紡海力司毛毯等類，共計二十五種並增售棉布七種，售價均較市爲低，今日照例開售棉紗。</p>
<p>昨日紐約美棉，上下三五磅音，計近期美余二六·七五，遠期二六·六一，米特林現貨二·三〇，本埠現棉交易較爲减色，僅申新紗廠進彰德花價十萬〇五千，又三餘鎭價九萬六千，又大豐美種細絨花九萬五千，以上均送廠價，紡建公司未有舉動，周浦籽花仍開一萬七千元，市價較昨略有參差。棉布市銷萎靡，蓋如川地美亭士林祇十萬元，申盤九萬五千元，其拆息水脚稅餉等項，實無利可圖，是以布市短期內恐難振興也。</p>

<h3>法蘭羢當銷　市貸缺乏行情貴</h3>
<p>法蘭　近因天暖當銷，西服帮因客銷頻起，採購　續步增，灰色需要更股，然其市貨非常缺乏，大路帮絕少握存，拆貨帮亦皆不充，故其行情甚昂，大半俱有有行無市之勢。</p>
<h3>久雨放晴　米價回跌</h3>
<p>昨日米市，因天氣放晴，又爲前次百餘艘米船在黃渡被扣，已全部放行，來源通暢，到貨踴躍，人心轉軟，粳秈米價均下挫二千元外，尤以南帮早薄稻最爲呆滯，惟白元則貨稀仍趣定勢，麵粉成交寥寥，價形平疲，油市亦回小千元左右，生汕靑島現路貨均有售出，市勢不振，于豆油到貨尙少，黃豆轉入疲境，再小四五百元，豆餅回小百餘元，麩皮平站，菉豆芝蔴均少上落，惟生油高貨甚俏，續漲二千餘元。</p>
<h3>糖價微緊</h3>
<p>食糖連日步鬆，昨稍回好，如中砂白前日曾進四萬九千元，昨做過四萬九千五百元，四半　白以貨缺較緊，行售呌八萬五六千元，號貨售出寥寥。</p>
<h3>白鉛皮　貨缺價昂</h3>
<p>比利時白鉛皮，來貨中斷，已達七八年之久，因此本街所有存貨，愈求愈涸，行市隨之蒸蒸日上，超過紅盤達三倍或五倍，以需要之多寡，而分別其售價之高低，如九號十號印書房之用度甚大，故價亦最高，刻每桶喊四百三十萬元，八號每桶喊三百二十萬元，二號薄花色張數較多，用度亦廣，現每桶沽三百萬元，六號與十八號十九號價相仿，均在二百廿萬元光景，前者供電池廠之用，後者則專用於籌鋅板，十二十四十六諸花色爲用較少，故售價最低，每桶不過一百五六十萬而已。</p>

<h3>如此長沙！人如潮水一樣流　徬徨找不到歸宿之路</h3>
<p>— 本報九日長沙航訊　佚名寄</p>
<p>一火四戰後的長沙，表面似漸臻繁榮，街頭熙來攘往，摩肩接踈。人如潮水一般地往長沙流，使長沙「住的問題」增加其嚴重性。而糧價之漲，因人口集中以致供求失調，兩者似亦不無相當關係。但糧價飛漲，尙有其他重要因素。號稱湖南糧倉的濱湖十一縣，最近派代表來省，向省府請求免購軍糧，理由爲各縣存糧無幾，乏力供應。這個產米豐富之區，竟然發出糧荒一聲，不使人感覺詫異麽？實則一點也不稀奇。</p>
<p>室如懸磬野無青草</p>
<p>自前歲湘桂戰役以迄去夏湘西　戰，本省遭受寇患甚深，加以去年各縣發生旱災，水災，風災，虫災。人民逃亡歸來，無以自存。就連綽號糧倉的洞庭區域，　有「室如懸磬，野無靑草」之感。其他瘠磽山地，更可想而知。鉅額軍糧的配購，更增重糧荒的程度。依照中央明令，本省今年田賦是被豁免了，可是要以二十餘元一石的低價配購軍糧三百六十萬石，由各縣分別担負，這付千斤重担壓到湖南農民的肩上。目然，軍糧之必須配購，乃是事實。以本省而論，目前駐軍和過境軍隊，尙有二十萬人，日俘亦將及十萬人，每日需糧數字，十分龐大，此項糧源不能仰給於川黔等省，而必須仰給於本省地方。然而究因本省存糧有限，這　大量採購，結果，劇烈波動了糧價。今年春荒期間，如此冗長，我們直担心今後會不會發生更嚴重的現象。聽說離本市僅三四十里的沙坪地方，目前已經發現吃草皮樹根的慘事。</p>
<p>桐鄉一帶搶犯如麻</p>
<p>渡過湘江到西鄉，這裏美桐鄉一帶，盜匪如麻，最近一個月，連接發生搶案十餘起，行旅裹足。爲生活逼得挺而走險的人，正　有增無减。省政當局似乎很關心糧食問題，吳奇偉主席在一次招待記者的談話中，說省府已將軍糧配額三百六十萬石，减少約百萬石，俾得稍稍解除民間痛苦。他同時勸吿湘人，踴躍認購。目前事實是存在着如此的矛盾。如果軍糧的採購拖延時間過久，斷斷續續，則波動糧價的機會愈多，糧價永遠不能達到安定，而實際呢，湖南人民目前已無力量作一次大量的供應。隨着糧價的上漲，其他物價也同樣波動。</p>
<p>小小資本撑持門面</p>
<p>商塲情形，並沒有增加繁榮的成份。擁有雄厚資本的商店，找遍目前的長沙，已經「寥若晨星」。刦後之餘，十九是由小資本的佔夥，湊集若干貨物，撑持門面。據商會負責人談：本市戰前行棄，計八十餘個單位，目前已聲請登記者，不及一半，其餘均無力恢復。商會前曾電請財政部撥二百萬萬元，作爲週轉救濟，然迄今尙無下文。人民購買力薄弱，自然是形成商業凋敝的原因。省府吳主席在另一次招待會中作過如下的統計：在全省七十八縣市中，爲敵攻陷　擾者達五十四縣市，其餘廿四縣，如沅陵·辰谿·芷江等處，都曾遭受敵機猛炸，直接死於敵炳下的人民達五十七萬以上，間接死亡者尙未計及。各種物資損失，總値達一十一萬三千二百六十四萬五千六百零四萬九千九百八十元。這個統計不能看爲誇大事實。即以畏沙而論，據李市長報吿：房屋被燬者達百分之九十以上。頹垣斷瓦，滿目凄凉。人民元氣大傷，而目前長沙恰恰反映了這個創痕。</p>
<p>搭蓋矮屋避風禦雨</p>
<p>現在成千成萬的人，回到長沙，開始從荒凉的廢墟中，重建自已的家園。沉默而艱辛地，檢取那些殘存的磚元，在廢墟上搭蓋狹若鴿子籠的矮屋，勉强躲風避雨。廢墟的主人回來了，馬上呌他　　，他們的生活就如沒根的水草，織浮無定，這是目前長沙十　　　人的　　·　　大批關金法幣，回來建築大厦的，究屬不多，偏僻街巷，除掉臨時搭　的草棚以外，始終乏人問津。通街兩旁的商店，如南正路·中正路。東長路。中山路一帶，搭　的方式，大都因陋就　，　虎得可以。這是由於民間實力的枯竭，欲圖恢復　觀，談何容易！「屋荒」是目前長沙透頂嚴重的問題。許多人回到長沙，都感覺這個問題不易解決。而因爲供不應求的關係，租價抬高，不僅租金一律用米計算，一間堪可促膝的斗室起碼六七斗米一月，而且須預　上個月，或半年之久。這大大增加了房客的育苦。因爲　荒，建築公司應運而生，有如雨後春筍的蓬勃。</p>
<p>活動房屋渴望運湘</p>
<p>市民正注視着農民銀行的房　建築貸款，湖南善後救濟分署將如何擴大平民住宅的建築，以及美國活動房屋之運湘能否眞正兌現的問題。</p>
<h3>科學化造船工業　發揮高度成就　英造船研究協會確立新目標</h3>
<p>〔本報編譯室譯〕英國克萊德造船廠的出品是世界著名的。他們先後建造的巨輪，如「阿葵他尼亞」號，「露西他尼亞」號，「瑪麗皇后」號，『伊莉莎白皇后」號等，在出現的時候，都是當時最巨大迅捷的，但英國東北海岸一帶的船塢所享的盛名，倒也不在克萊德之下，它們分散在裴爾法斯德，盤根海，巴洛等處，都有憂憂獨造的成就，而成爲全世界造船業的楷模。</p>
<p>造船廠的地點</p>
<p>任何國家在建立造船工業的時候，造船廠的地理位置是非常熏要的。設立造船廠的地點，必需具備兩個條件：第一，爲下水方便起見，必須要有一條容易通到海洋的航道。第二，附近一帶，必需要有可資利用的主要原料。從前的船都是木製的，所以英國海岸一帶的小港灣裏到處都是船塢，因爲英國出產木材極多，在原料方面可以不成問題。以後，造船的原料由木材而改爲鐵，後來又改爲鋼。自然，離開鋼鐵產地較遠的船塢，就漸趨　落，而鄰近這些產地的港灣，如泰茵·梯士·克萊德等處的船塢，就很快的興旺起來了。</p>
<p>船廠曁停船塢</p>
<p>在一九三五年，全英國有一百五十八家造船廠開工，大多專門製造供內河航行的船隻。一九三九年，製造海輪的船廠，的有五十家，其中每年造輪總噸數在一萬噸至五萬噸之間者的三十家，五萬唯至十萬噸者約十家，十萬噸至十五萬噸者六家，十五萬噸以上者四家·停船塢的數目和大小，各廠也不同，最大的船廠有船塢二十多個，其中有幾個的長度，在一千英尺以上。</p>
<p>戰時造船計劃</p>
<p>在戰爭期中，英國的造艦計劃與美國或加拿大不同，他們並不專門注重數量。爲了適應戰時運輸的種種需要，英國製造了各種商船，其中包括冷藏船，起重用船，商用航空母艦，油船，拖輪，和其他各種小型船隻。因爲這些船隻性能特殊，設計又時時需要修改，所以製造時幾乎應用了英國造船業所有的全部技巧，而道些慘淡經營所得的經騐，在全世界造船工業上是非常有價値的。</p>
<p>茀洛德研究院</p>
<p>自從一八七一年起，英國在造船工業上已經開始了有系統的硏究。那一年，威廉茀洛德奉英國海軍部之命，建築了第一只新式的測騐艇。一九一二年，英國爲了紀念這位工程師的功績，創辦了　　德硏究院，現在道研究院已成爲國立物理硏究院的一部，許許多多新式商船在建造之初，都曾送到這裏來檢查。一九三六年，英國建造了一百十八萬噸以上的船隻，其中有九十二萬噸（百分之七十八）是根據這硏究院裏的檢騐的。其他公司之中，送檢的船隻圖樣，達八十八種之多。</p>
<p>造船研究協會</p>
<p>一九四四年，又成立了一個英國造船研究協會，是全英造船業有關的團聯聯合組成的，他們的目標是「使英國仕科學化的造船工業中能够發揮最高度的成就」·這些團體中，包括造船業公會·海軍部·造船廠·船隻修理廠·技術協會等等，他們正在羣策羣力，克服着一切困難，他們將使一英國製」的海輪繼續在航業界上長保令譽。（P．H．）</p>
<p>英國著名造船廠內金屬技工部，由該工塲所佔面積之大，可覘知其規模之宏。</p>

<p>自由談　婦女与家庭特輯</p>
<p>家庭</p>
<h3>民主化的愛</h3>
<p>— 涓流</p>
<p>父母的愛，是世間最純眞，最偉大的愛，它不需任何條件，任何代價。但不幸，在這敎育落後，多數還被封建思想所支配着的中國家庭裏，有不少的父母的天賦純眞的愛，被傳統的自私觀念所沾汚損害。他們把子女看做他們的所有物，子女被處於絕對從屬，絕對支配的地位，沒有獨立的人格，應得的自由。權利。他們視自私爲愛，把自私與愛混爲一談。</p>
<p>他們蔑視子女的智識及作事能力，爲爲他們的見解都是不對的，時時斥責他們的意見，處處干預他們的行動。他們要子女服從他們的成見，强迫聽信他們的武斷。他們認爲子女不勝任一切的事情，甚麽事都要他們鰓鰓過慮，越俎代勞·他們鞠躬盡瘁，爲子女作無謂的犧牲。但同時便剝奪了子女的意志與行動的自由，阻塞了他們的個性與能力的發展·然而在那些父母們的心目中，却認爲他們的犧牲完全是爲了愛護子女。其實他們主要的動機乃是自私的下意識，所謂『愛』，不過是理智假借它來使他們的行爲『合理化』，使子女不得不在這冠冕堂皇的名詞下就範而已。</p>
<p>這種以愛爲名而行自私之實的愛，在子女們不啻是一把鎖鍊，使他們受絕大的苦痛而不敢反抗。爲了『不認拂逆親心』，不知斷送了多少靑年人的幸福，埋沒了多少靑年人的才能，誤了多少靑年人的前程，我們寗願失愛，不敢接受這種假面的『慈愛』</p>
<p>當然，子女的智識，經騐，作事能力以及自制力量往往是不够的。然而爲父母的祗能居於顧問指導，和從旁協助的地位。眞正的愛是建立在不妨害子女的獨立人格，合理的自由與權利的原則上的。這種愛纔是『民主化的愛』，纔能使子女得益，並獲得子女的信仰——父母雖不施壓力，他們倒會事事就敎於父母，聽取父母的指示；反之，在『專制式的愛』之下，他們爲了怕父母過分的干涉，完全的支配，他們遇到了問題，不敢在父母前提出，不是悶在心頭痛苦着，便是獨斷獨行，入於歧途。</p>
<p>子女不祇是屬於父母的，一家的，同時是屬於子女自己的和社會的。父母對子女，當放棄一己的私意，事事以子女的利益爲先，處處爲社會的福利而着想。這樣纔是眞正的茲愛。</p>

<p>在民主高潮澎湃的今日，許多人都競談婦女的參政問題，認爲婦女能够得到參政權，男女平權的最高理想才算實現。婦女要從隸屬的地位解放出來，要想爭取人格的獨立和解放，最低限度有四種要求：第一，要求政治上的自由平等。第二，要求法律上的自由平等。第三，要求職業上的自由平等。第四，要求敎育上的自由平等。這些要求，必須婦女獲得參政權才可以完全達到。</p>
<p>所謂婦女參政權問題，不僅是普通爭取選舉權，因爲爭取選舉權還只是片面的。眞正的婦女參政，所要求實現的是完全的公民權，包括選舉權，被選舉權，政治結社權，言論思想自由權，以及被委任爲行政。司法，以及一切公務機關的官員之權，敎育權，財政管理及繼承權等。在要求得到這此權利時，必須各種條件都與男子同等。</p>
<p>婦女旣以公民的資格取得選舉權，便可以決定立法者的命運，並運用政治的力量糾正一向不合理的偏重於男權的法律。婦女不打進政治的圈子，隨你怎樣高呼男女平權的口號也是徒然。現在各國的開明的政治家，已經相信婦女參政，可以改造政治。即使怎樣頑固的執政者，他們也會感到民主潮流所趨，只有讓婦女一步步跨進政治之門的。最早實行婦女參政的美國，紐西蘭，芬蘭，都以婦女參政後的優良结果昭示於世界。產業革命後，家庭制度破壞，婦女被捲入生存競爭的漩渦中，社會政治的變革，對婦女都有直接的影響。注定了舊社會制度的崩潰，而婦女要求運用政治權，成爲民主潮流之所趨。的確，政治和婦女的關係至爲密切。政是衆人的事，管理衆人的事便是政治。我們旣承認婦女也是人，而且天賦予她們一切的權利，便不能否認她們在政治中應該發揮的力量。不讓婦女參政，就無異推翻男女平權的口號。婦女如果不努力爭取參政的權利，就無異斷送自己前途的幸福。——婦女旣獲參政權，然後在職業上，敎育上，婚姻上便可以得到立法的公平處置。</p>
<p>婦女要希望獲得眞正的參政權，一定要經過堅苦的奮鬥。過去不知多少婦女拿自己的血和肉和社會的封建勢力以及傳統觀念搏鬥。就我國說，以反帝反封建爲主要目的的「五四」運動，在思想上打破了歷代宗法社會的禮教，重取婦女獨立的人格。她們便是以婦女參政作爲主要的骨幹，由北平，而至上海，廣州，漢口，長沙，紛紛響應，集合了廣大的婦女羣，展開偉大的婦女解放運動，可是那時的努力，並沒有能够使婦女的地位得到完全的保陣，大多數的婦女仍舊在封建的桎梏掙扎。直到「五卅」慘案發生，才由上層婦女所包辦的女權運動，進入下層婦女解放的新階段。可知婦女解放運動的力量，是慢慢累積起來的，是漸漸擴大牠的影響的。以後一直下去，中國的婦女比以前更增進了自身對民族國家的認識，更深知現實社會所存留着的腐惡勢力，必須完全根除，從實踐的工作中，增强對現實的認識與把握。婦女運動到了這時，已經和民族解放運動配合起來了。每個婦女，都從歷史的敎訓中，認淸參政運動成爲整個婦女解放運動的核心，同時更理解只有中華民族澈底的解放，中國的廣大的婦女羣才能達到參政的最後目標！</p>
<p>這次我國的八年堅苦的抗戰，更敎育了無量數的婦女，使他們進一步了解參政的意義。現在我們獲得最後勝利，八年的烈士們鮮血沒有白流。婦女在今後的建國過程中所應担當的使命實在很重大。我們不希望婦女空喊口號，我們希望大時代的婦女能够負担起對社會應盡的義務。婦女參政的最高目標是：使婦女能在健全的政治組織下活動，利用合法的選舉權和被選舉權，從她們所投的選舉票上表現出她們的政治意見。並且從她們被選舉後所從事的活動上表現出她們的政治能力。單單爭取到與男子同等的政權，怎能算是眞正的參政？</p>
<p>建國時期的中國婦女，要體令自身對民族國家所負使命的重大，克服一切艱阻，拿政治的力量去推翻不合理的社會關係和社會傳統。培養自己參政的實力，把知識，技能和實踐配合起來。在廣大的社會中學習磨鍊。到了智能發展，體力强健，意志堅決，經騐充分以後，更可以很快的取得和男子同等的自由與權利！</p>
<h3>女人女人</h3>
<p>— 冬心輯</p>
<p>女人差不多都是喜歡別人歌頌的。即使是最傲慢的女人，總存有三分自卑心理。——摩拉</p>
<p>男子因戀愛而結婚，女人爲結婚而愛。——湯卜生</p>
<p>男人出門時，常常這樣忖度：「我該談些甚麽？」女人出門時，總是這樣躊躇：我該穿些甚麽？」——懷特</p>
<p>甚麽話都好談，祗別去妄談女人的心理：這樣祇顯出你的淺稚，被娘兒們好笑。我必要談女人，也定要等到一隻脚已踏進了墳墓裏：不等被她捉住，另一隻脚可以馬上路進去——托爾斯泰</p>
<p>家庭</p>
<h3>怎樣做後母</h3>
<p>— 巴玲</p>
<p>做後母，是一件不容易的事。俗語說：「熱天的日頭，晚娘的拳頭！」可見後母在中國社會上，是被一般人認爲兇惡的代名詞的。</p>
<p>然而，就我看來，在我們中國的家庭裏，賢良的後母，未始沒有；但因爲大多數做後母的婦女們，對於前妻所生的子女，很少親愛的緣故，於是一般人不談後母則已；否則，總是認爲做後母的婦女們，對於前妻所生的子女，都是不親愛的，甚而至於都是虐待的，這實在是一種不合實際的評論。</p>
<p>爲了糾正一般人輕視後母的觀念起見，怎樣做後母是有加以討論的必要。</p>
<p>（一）多川獎勵，少用責罰：—兒童大都是好動的，因爲好動的緣故，便會因此常常鬧出事來。做後母的人，對於兒童的錯誤，應多川獎勵的方法，使兒童在無形之中，走到一條正當的路上去。非至萬不得已的時候，絕對不要責罰，因爲做後母的，即使輕輕的責罰兒童，而左鄰右舍，就要議論不已了。</p>
<p>（二）以身作則，領導兒童：－例如兒童有晏起，吃零食，不淸潔等惡習慣，做後母的，除了用和善的熊度，開導他們外，更須以身作則，領導兒童，每天在一定的時候起床，在兒童的面前，不吃零食，衣服淸潔，家庭中一切的佈置，都親手使它美化而整潔。這樣，以身作則，兒童在無形中，一定會受到感化，而跟着早起，不吃零食，和整潔了。</p>
<p>（三）要利用機會，和兒童混在一起——春天到了，「春光明媚，」「鳥語花香，」是春遊的好機會。做後母的，大可利用時間，在兒童休假的時候，和他們一同出去，作短途的旅行，和野餐，使兒童們覺得後母是可愛的，而不是可懼的，藉以增加母子間的感情。</p>
<p>總之，做後母的地位，是吃力而不討好的。但假如一般家庭中的後母們，都能以前妻之子女，和自己的子女一樣看待，並隨時利用上述三種方法，我相信二社會上對於後母的觀念，一定可以改變過來的。</p>

<h3>警告獨身主義者</h3>
<p>— 楊永彰</p>
<p>每個人都有他自已的哲學和人生觀。獨身主義就是那些不願結婚者所推崇的主張。當然，他們有經濟學，社會學和其學科上的理山和根據。這我姑　不論。現在單就醫學的立塲來介紹一些關於獨身主義的「價値」。</p>
<p>獨身的人以爲不結婚就可以免去種種麻煩，享受淸福，並無家庭之累，不知事實却相反。據最近統計，各種疾病的罹患率和死亡率已婚者遠遜於未婚者，換言之，後者比較容易患病，不幸一且病倒後，也比較容易死去。</p>
<p>這是什麽緣故呢？原來抱獨身的人，他們的生活（由於沒有家庭）多半不守規律，不像已婚者有妻子的內助，因此飲食不愼，多易患胃腸病（如慢性胃炎，傷寒霍亂等）；又對衣着之不注意，每有傷風，流行性感冒之虞。因此獨身者多因營養不良，生活失調而有貧血，肺結核之發生。又那些獨身者多是鬱鬱不得志或是自得其樂的人，當然喜歡吸烟飲食和賭博，這在身體及心理上多少影響及於健康的：</p>
<p>獨身主義者，聽聽我警吿吧！</p>
<h3>婦女界的幾個實際問題</h3>
<p>— 凌集熙</p>
<p>婦女問題與整個社會問題有着密切的聯繫。在一切的事情還沒有上軌道的今天，婦女問題怎樣能够得到解決呢？道是不可吾認的事實。不過在主觀方面，我們雖不敢妄自菲薄，却也不願誇大其詞，像「環境所造成，過程所必然」，道一類的時電話是可以輕輕地把自己的責任推掉了的，講多了非常危險我。們應該坦白地，勇敢地，批判地，暴露自己的弱點，少喊口號。多作自我的進修。</p>
<p>在今天，婦女問題的解決，主要的是如何充實自己與團結自已，然後向客觀上的障碍物進攻。在婦女界自身的圈子里面要相互競賽，她比我好，我比她還要好，可是不是對立的。我不怕她比我好，她好了，我還要希望她更好。倘若是我比她好，我一定要拉住她，叫她跟我一齊好。更要緊的是在婦女界之中，可以不必分出什麽黨派，因爲我們自己還可憐得很呢。我們自已的事情還弄不好呢！我們需要的是團結，是充實，在今後，允必須注意有下面的幾個實際問題：</p>
<p>（一）建立正確的婚姻觀念。</p>
<p>（二）注意鍛鍊身體的健康。</p>
<p>（三）呈請政府廣設托兒所。</p>
<p>（四）呈請政府廣設市立女子中學與國立女子大學，或在市立女中與國立女大內多設女生名額。</p>
<p>（五）已經參加職業圈的，要努力求進步。</p>
<p>婦女</p>
<h3>女人的故事</h3>
<p>— 張宛靑</p>
<p>女人好像永遠是浸在悲哀的淵泉裏，惟其如此，所以才覺得女人是痛苦的。女人一生下地，接生佬佬說：「是位千金」，母親聽了先縐縐眉，有祖母呢？一定說：「賠錢貨」！弟兄雖多，養一個養一個的，只要是個男的，一家大小都瞅着喜歡。「女孩子運尿都是臊的」，我小時候常聽得我」奶媽說。梳上兩條小辮子，穿件花化衣裳，「偏這女孩子討厭，要梳辮子！不梳吧，又像個小子，多費事？還是男孩子省事。男孩子又不懂得挑肥揀瘦，偏這小丫頭子見人穿花衣裳她也要穿！」</p>
<p>女孩子從小是生成了愛模仿的：愛哭，愛爭分數，沒記性，小心眼兒多，常常吵紅了臉，過了一會兒就又好了。撒嬌，懶，出門愛坐車，聲請了助學金，偏又在同學跟前說，我媽昨天又給我買了一雙皮鞋，好幾萬呢。塡起報吿書來，我家裏窮，我父親收入有限，假使沒有助學金的話，我簡直沒有念書的機會了。寫得多麼悽慘，看着讓人下淚，可是滿不是那麼一回事，假的！愛說誑話，十句就有八句是謅出來的。瞞得好，誰也聽不出來；瞞得不好呢，說穿了再來强辯。愛多說話，愛問，愛吃嘴，「這隻燻鷄是留着給爸爸下酒的，等會爸爸喝酒的時候，別在旁邊看！」爸爸來了，喝酒，偏要在旁邊看，爸爸看不過去，撕了一條鷄腿，啃着，啃着，媽來了，說，「剛吃了飯，又吃鷄，沒跟你說過麽？不許在桌子面前恍，偏來！饞嘴貨！不吃不舒服！」爸爸也許笑了，「女孩子都饞嘴呢！你小時候也是一樣的！是我給她的呢！我又吃不了！」圖算是解了，漓着眼淚，鷄腿捨不得就扔，一直的啃，啃到了骨頭，才扔在地上，看看爸爸，看看媽媽，默的溜了出去。</p>
<p>長得也標緻了，和男孩子一樣的皮；踢球，鞋一月一雙還要補掌子。胸部漸漸高起來了，懂得羞了，肚子痛，冷的不許吃，在床上睡着，多悶呀，多雜過，男孩子就不是這樣呢。</p>
<p>從媽媽的手上又移過來別人的手了，那是年輕的，漂亮的，和自已歲數相仿的一個男的：看電影，成了便飯，學校，不想去了；隨了音樂的拍子，旋轉，旋轉，從舞塲旋轉到禮堂上去了；從鼓掌聲，哄笑聲，讚美聲中，又到了一個世界：什麼都是新的，人是少的，淸靜的，慢慢地，學着一燒菜，學着理家，學着搬是非，學着小氣，學着胡出風頭，學着請客會鈔的時候慢慢的拉皮夾子的練子，學着釘男人的黃包車，學着和男人大吵大鬧。</p>
<p>其初，還相讓點，漸漸地，不回來了，眼淚鼻涕的，沒効力了，多早晚才熬出來呀？媽媽帮不了忙，爸爸也不能說過分的話，守着吧，守着也許有回心的那一天！一年兩年的過去了，又成了一個家，兩邊都是一樣的，都是女人，都有孩子，兩邊住。女人是脆弱的呀！是離不了男人扶的呀！女人又生女人，女人永遠生不完「人」。</p>
<p>女人永遠是這樣活下去的呢！女人應該靠着男人，吃碗現成的碗，打駡由之，譏笑由之，欺凌由之，一脚踢出去由之，一代一代。</p>
<p>女人不善於獨立，不想獨立，不願意獨立，不能獨立，惟其如此，女人永遠要活在男人的手底下：要挨打，要受氣，要做小老婆，要當娼妓，要被男人玩弄，要諂媚男人，要聽男人的指揮，要受男人的支配。女人好像有說不完的故事，這些故事，從老老老老……祖母的手裏，就帶來了！女人要屈伏，要忍受，要「呼天搶地」；忍是女人的本份，忍是女人的拿手好戲，刀子戳在心尖上，「忍」！</p>
<p>忍總有一天要翻身的，不善於獨立的要獨立，不想獨立的要獨立，不願獨立的要獨立，不能獨立的要獨立！智識第一，技能第二，工作第三，勞苦第四。不羨慕人，不諂媚人，充實學問，養好身體，鍛鍊技能，埋頭苦幹。挽起袖子，廚房裏去；拿起筆桿，社會上去；女人不再愛哭，也不再爭分數，不小心眼兒多，不撒嬌，不懶，出門不多坐車，不說誑話，不饞嘴，不搬是非，不小氣，不胡出風頭，不慢慢的拉皮夾子的練子，不釘男人的黃包車，不和男人大吵大鬧，不靠着男人的扶助，不吃碗玩成飯。不讓人打，不讓人駡，不讓人議笑，不讓人欺凌，也不讓人一脚踢出去；女人應該充實自已的力量，女人不再浸在悲哀的淵泉裘，女人是人，女人永不再悲哀！</p>
<p>兒童</p>
<h3>別教孩子犯過</h3>
<p>— 尙未成</p>
<p>做父母的看到自己底孩子犯了過錯，差不多個個都是憤恨異常，接着就是痛打一頓，嚴責一番。罵過，打過，也就算過。他們都是以爲這種過錯是發生於偶然的。再犯了呢？就再打再駡。如果還是犯下去呢？那末，孩子底父母失望了，傷心了：說這孩子大生不學好，不士進，甚而至於還要感而嘆之曰：：不知自己前世作了什麼孽，原養出這種不肖的孩子來！</p>
<p>說孩子犯過錯是天生的，我不敢相信，說是父母作了什麽孽，原有這種事，我倒以爲是「入木二分半」的。爲什麽不是「三分」呢？因爲這種父母們還是弄錯一些：這種孽，不是在前世作的，而是作在孩子誕生以後，作在今世的綠故。</p>
<p>究竟作了什麼孽呢？說來確要請父母們難過，是作了直接間接地，自己——或是別人而自己沒有阻止——敎孩子犯他今日所犯這過錯的方法的孽！</p>
<p>就拿說謊來說吧。說謊有時是因爲客觀條件逼着他非如此不可的，但有的是不說謊就難過的，如果前者相當於肺病第二期，那末後者就是不可收拾的第三期。第一期是什麼呢？就是受敎期。當然我並不是說，父母們會敎孩子們向壞，向下流，敎孩子們說謊！但是我相信類似下面的事實確是常存在於每個家庭中的：一個孩子，他有時並不願意呌你，或者說另一個人不好，在這時，你爲了一時自我底高興，好玩，手裏拿一塊糖，對孩子說：『你呌我娘娘，我就把糖給你吃」，或是「你駡他小鬼，我就歡喜你」。孩子如果喊了娘娘或罵了小鬼，立刻酬報就拿出糖：或是吻一下。天眞無瑕的孩子們，他們底慾望，亦不過是吃和受到長者底愛撫，慾望是無限的。當他們看到足以滿足欲望的東西時，他們就本能地要得到。當他們知道交換條件是呌一聲娘娘，或駡一句小鬼時，儘管他們不願意如此做，亦就不得不做了。這一做，他就讀完全了「說謊學」的第一章！由此，他就下意識地印在心底裏：說謊是一種滿足慾望時的一種手段。一旦他不能達到某一目的時，他就會不由而由地又說謊來做手段了！說慣了，變成了一種「病」，即使在沒有說謊的必要，自己亦不願說時，亦是在說。這，始之於幼年，始之於孩提時代！</p>
<p>說謊如此，其他的過錯，亦復如此！</p>
<p>爲了一時的興趣，會使自已永遠煩惱，更會貽害了孩子底終身，，如果不及早糾正！</p>
<p>但是，如果孩子已經犯了（當然，還沒有敎過孩子的，是不應再敎，敎過的，立刻中止），那末糾正的辦法是不是靠打和駡，就可使他（她）不再犯罪呢？在普通的人以爲一定可以的，因爲孩子會知道犯了道過錯就會受到肉體上和精神上的苦痛的。但，事實並不然。孩子還是會再在的。爲什麼？我們總知道，父母在打孩子時，一面打，一面總犯說：「你說！下次再做（說）不做（說）了？說啊！說了「不』，就不打！』逃避一切苦痛是一切生物的本能。在這時，孩子旣沒有反抗的餘地，亦沒有反抗的能力！他聽父母對他底責備是不容易聽進的，但在聽到「說了『不」，就不打了」的時候，他得到了希望，他到得可以逃避目前苦痛的捷徑，祇要說了「不」！孩子說了，父母不再打了，而且以爲孩子侮過了。其實，孩子根本沒有想到「下次不了」什麽，他所知道的是說了「不」和「就不打了」的關係，就等於「呌我娘娘」和「就把糖給你吃」的關係完全一樣！所以，孩子不但不會不再犯過，他並且還學會了犯了過錯，給父母責罰時，祇要說句「下次不了」就可以萬事皆息！會說謊的更會說了，不會說，不懂此道的，亦就在此啓了蒙。</p>
<p>孩子犯過以打駡爲糾正的乎段不但成事不足，簡直敗事有餘！霍甫特曼說：「懺悔的心事，要表現成言辭，這不是說是說些好話便可以嫌誘得出來，也不是舉些嚴刑峻法便可以威脅得出來的。」當然施之以刑法亦還是不行！我們祇有用種種的方法帮助孩子使他們知道困難的事不一定用他所犯的過錯的形式才能解決，吿訴他用別種正當的方法來解次不是更好？更使他們明白犯過的不好的原因和所在。如此，才能漸漸地减少孩子底不是。</p>
<p>做孩子底父母們，請當心你們底孩子！</p>

<h3>With the Spirit of "Sword and Shoes": Completing Restoration and Construction: Full Text of Chairman Chiang's Political Address at the Political Council</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 20th] Chairman Chiang delivered an address at the opening ceremony of the Fourth Session, Second Plenary Meeting of the Political Council on the morning of the 20th. The full text is as follows:</p>
<p>Chairman, Honorable Councilors:</p>
<p>Today is the first day of the Fourth Session, Second Plenary Meeting of the Political Council. After a long separation, I am very pleased to gather with you again. Our Political Council has made particularly great contributions to upholding the national policy of resistance and assisting in the success of the war of resistance. Today, I would like to express to your council that the contributions of our eight-year war of resistance, the entire population, and all officers and soldiers who shed blood and sacrificed for the country and the nation will be immortal. In addition, there are two points that are important factors in achieving our sustained success in the war of resistance. First, during the war of resistance, our Political Council united its will, concentrated its strength, did not flinch from any difficulties, and unswervingly upheld the national policy of resistance to the end, ultimately achieving success. Secondly, I cannot but mention Sichuan, the important base area for the war of resistance, which contributed the most manpower and material resources, and the men, women, old, and young compatriots in Chongqing endured the enemy's fiercest bombings, not hesitating to sacrifice all life and property, sharing life and death with the government, persevering, and striving again and again. Their praiseworthy integrity is truly enough to move heaven and earth and make ghosts and spirits weep. These are all merits worthy of great writing in the history of the war of resistance, and they are also what I have personally experienced and will never forget. Therefore, today, after the victorious end of the war of resistance, I want to express my admiration for the compatriots in Sichuan, and I want to pay the highest respect to the Political Council.</p>
<p>The last meeting of the Political Council was held on the anniversary of the July 7th Incident last year. At that time, I expressed my deep expectations for your council to strive for national freedom, safeguard national independence, accelerate the collapse of the enemy, and establish a constitutional structure. Shortly after the last meeting, Japan surrendered unconditionally, and our war of resistance finally came to a victorious end. What has not yet been completed now is the issue of post-war restoration and rehabilitation, restoring transportation, stabilizing the locality, relieving the people's suffering, and implementing constitutional government to complete the task of national construction. This meeting of your council is particularly significant and the task is particularly arduous, as it is held after the victorious end of the war of resistance and just before the convening of the National Assembly, the promulgation of the constitution, and the implementation of constitutional government.</p>
<p>The administrative measures of various government departments will be reported to your council by the heads of the respective departments. What I want to raise to your council is the national environment after the war and the progress of the restoration work. Before the end of the war of resistance, I often said that the work after the war would be even more difficult than during the war. We have been at war for such a long time, and the damage in the war zones is so severe. Once the restoration begins, the wartime system must be changed to peacetime, the manpower, material resources, and land that have undergone great destruction and damage must be recovered, and the places that have been ravaged by the enemy and puppets for a long time must be restored to order. There are thousands of things to be done, and the work is complicated. What's more, we still have to suffer from various internal obstacles and difficulties. First of all, military orders and government orders cannot be completely unified. Secondly, the transportation equipment for restoration is seriously damaged before and after the victory. Those who do not understand the government's situation and difficulties use various methods to obstruct the progress of the restoration work. In addition, there is a lack of talent and material preparation required for the restoration work, which makes the restoration work prolonged and cannot be carried out satisfactorily. The suffering of our people after the war, such as widespread disasters, rising prices, local instability, lack of security in life, the inability of displaced people to return home, and the inability of those with jobs to enjoy their work, are even more serious in certain areas than during the war. It is truly what is called "like water, the deeper it gets; like fire, the hotter it gets." This is truly the most heartbreaking phenomenon. In order to save the people from suffering and ensure the fruits of victory, the government believes that restoration and construction require a peaceful and stable environment and the concerted efforts of the whole country. Therefore, on the one hand, in the case of manpower and talent being extremely difficult, we will do our best to remove all obstacles and promote the restoration work. On the other hand, we especially have to compromise and tolerate and use political methods to achieve national peace and unity, to make the different opinions of all parties converge, and to eliminate man-made difficulties and obstacles. Because we have seen the depth of suffering, the weight of sacrifice, and the danger of the situation during the war of resistance, and the difficulty of building the country after the war, the government deeply feels that it should start all construction in the shortest possible time with the spirit of "sword and shoes" to make China a modern country of peace, unity, democracy, prosperity, and strength. Only in this way can we stand in the ranks of the international community. The government's painstaking efforts to be responsible for the entire country and the entire nation should be deeply understood and sincerely maintained by all of you present today.</p>
<p>Based on the above objectives, the government has devoted itself to the work of peace and unity since the end of the war of resistance, especially focusing on the work of uniting the will and concentrating the strength, so that all parties, factions, and social elites have the opportunity to participate in national politics. At the same time, we must ensure that the convening of the National Assembly proceeds smoothly. In January of this year, the government convened the Political Consultative Conference, and we had sincere discussions on five major issues: government organization, the program for peaceful national construction, the military reorganization plan, the draft constitution, and matters related to the convening of the National Assembly, in order to open the way for peaceful national construction. The promulgation of the order to cease military conflicts and restore transportation, the establishment of the Military Mediation Executive Headquarters, and the formulation of the basic plan for military reorganization and the unification of the Communist army into the National army by the military three-person team are all proceeding along this goal. Although the current situation still has many difficulties for the goal of national peace and unity, if China wants to survive independently in the world and maintain the fruits of the arduous war of resistance, I dare to say that the above policy is as important as the national policy of sustained war of resistance, and the whole country must be united, with the greatest patience and the greatest sincerity, to overcome all difficulties and promote its success.</p>
<p>Today, China's greatest demand and the most urgent need of the entire people is nothing more than the completion of post-war restoration and rehabilitation and the start of construction work. It has been seven months since the victory of the war of resistance. There must be no more obstacles or delays in the restoration, rehabilitation, and construction work. The suffering of the people and the disturbances in the locality must be quickly resolved. Therefore, the government's current focus is on (A) restoring national order, relieving the people's suffering, stabilizing the economy, and stabilizing people's livelihood, to start economic construction. (B) Striving to fully implement the order to cease military conflicts and restore transportation and to implement the basic plan for military reorganization agreed upon by the military three-person team, so that military orders and government orders can be unified, and the people of the whole country can have the opportunity to recuperate. (C) The National Assembly will be convened on May 5th and must be held as scheduled to achieve our long-cherished wish to implement constitutional government. As for international relations, we must implement the original intention of the war of resistance, strive for the integrity of national territory, sovereignty, and administration, sincerely fulfill the treaties we have signed with our allies, and uphold the Charter of the United Nations to promote international cooperation to consolidate world peace. All four of these are determined in response to the development of the domestic and international situation and based on the universal and consistent demands of the entire country. Before the implementation of constitutional government, your council is the highest public opinion organ in the country and the only organ that can best express the public opinion of the people. I hope that you will observe the current environment of the country and give consistent assistance to the above points.</p>
<p>I would also like to especially mention that the resident councilors have made the greatest contribution in the eight months since the last meeting of your council. After the end of the war, there have been many changes in the domestic and international situation, and the government's response to everything in the interim has been particularly heavy and arduous, but the close connection between the Political Council and the government has always been consistent, not only has there been no separation, but it has always assisted the government in correcting many shortcomings. During the recess of your council, the resident councilors objectively and sincerely reviewed the government's measures at any time and contributed valuable opinions. The government has also often submitted important matters in its administration to the resident councilors for reporting and listening to criticism. This spirit of close cooperation and sincere trust has laid a good foundation for our country's future implementation of constitutional government. Compared with the relationship between the parliament and the government in Western countries, it can be said that we are no longer ashamed and should continue to maintain and promote it.</p>
<p>Finally, I would like to earnestly offer a few concrete and frank opinions to you. Reviewing the suggestions of the past Political Councils, the government has earnestly implemented everything that can be adopted. This meeting is being held during the period when the war has ended and the restoration is not yet complete. There must be no few matters that need to be improved and restored in national construction and local order. The councilors have gathered in the temporary capital from all directions and have a clearer understanding of what they hear and see. The matters to be suggested must also be more ambitious. The government is prepared to accept good words to help the country through its difficulties and relieve the people's suffering. What the government hopes from your council is that all resolutions will be implemented in full. Therefore, I hope that this meeting will: (A) grasp the key points and make more active and concrete suggestions. (B) Pay attention to reality and contribute practical and feasible methods that will surely succeed. (C) The relief of local suffering can only be sought from national stability and development. The Political Council is a national public opinion organ. You are not only representing a region or an occupation, but are representing the people of the whole country. Therefore, all suggestions regarding the relief of local suffering and the improvement of local welfare must take into account the overall interests and actual situation of the country, weigh the pros and cons and urgency, and express your frank opinions and provide solutions. Regarding the above three matters, I would like to express this sincere expectation on behalf of the government, hoping that you will contribute your grand plans and point out the shortcomings, so that all departments of the government can understand the people's suffering, strive for improvement, and fulfill their responsibilities. I wish your council success and the health of all of you.</p>

<h3>US Credit Loan to China: Export-Import Bank Announces Approval of Five Items; Totaling Over 33 Million US Dollars</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 19th] The Export-Import Bank announced today that its board of directors has tentatively approved five credit loans to China in principle, totaling 33,793,750 US dollars. The details of the loans are still under negotiation and are expected to be completed within a few weeks. China will be able to use the credit loans to purchase a small number of ships in the United States, subsidize power plants, and repair raw materials and tools for railways and coal mines. The loan allocation is as follows: (1) $4,243,750 for the purchase of ten coastal freighters from the Maritime Commission. (2) $2,600,000 for the purchase of sixteen coastal freighters formerly managed by the Army Transportation Department, of which eleven were privately owned by the Wartime Shipping Administration. (3) $650,000 for the purchase of tools for repairing railways. (4) $8,800,000 for the purchase of ten 5,000-kilowatt auxiliary power plants. (5) $1,500,000 for the purchase of tools for coal mining. The terms of the above loans vary. The Export-Import Bank also announced that the Bank of China has signed an agreement with the Bank, guaranteed by the Chinese government, to establish a $33 million credit loan to purchase US cotton for state-run and private yarn factories. This credit loan was approved by the Bank's Board of Directors on January 17.</p>
<p>US Cotton Loan Also Established: Textile Industry's Raw Materials Secured</p>
<p>According to today's announcement, the loan term is generally the same as the Bank's cotton loans to European countries, with an interest rate of 2.5% and a repayment period of 24 months after the US cotton arrives in China. Because inland transportation in China takes longer, the loan is extended by nine months compared to loans to Europe. The Export-Import Bank further stated that the loan amount can purchase 275,000 to 300,000 bales of US cotton, which can supply approximately 500 million yards of Chinese cotton cloth. [Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 20th] According to government news, after the US Export-Import Bank provided a large amount of credit loans and US cotton loans, the raw material problem of the Chinese textile industry can be easily solved. Because the Chinese textile industry, which is currently taking over the textile industries operated by the Japanese, urgently needs a large amount of American cotton suitable for weaving fine cloth. In the next five years, China will still need to rely on large imports of American cotton to improve the finished products of Chinese cloth weaving and meet the people's clothing needs. China has cotton fields with boundless hope in Shaanxi, Henan, Jiangsu, and other provinces, but most of them are now abandoned.</p>
<h3>Cantonese-French Consulate Hides War Criminal</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper's Guangzhou 20th dispatch] A situation similar to the Shanghai's Baelding incident has occurred here. The former French Vichy government's consul in Guangdong, Simon, who has been listed as a war criminal, is now being hidden by the current French consul, who refuses to hand him over for interrogation. According to sources at the Office of the Commander-in-Chief, evidence of Simon's actions harming the Allied war effort was collected at the end of last year. At that time, the secretary of the French Consulate, Lao Ge, acting as the consul, was responsible for acknowledging and retaining the evidence and guaranteed to hand Simon over to us for interrogation at any time. Unexpectedly, on the 15th, the Office of the Commander-in-Chief, following proper diplomatic channels, sent personnel to the French Consulate in Shamian to request Simon's handover. However, the French Consul, Wei Yingzhang, repeatedly refused, claiming that Simon still possessed consular qualifications and was different from ordinary war criminals, acting on the orders of the French government, forbidding our interrogation. Our side believes that such a statement by the French Consul is unfriendly and considers that as this is an Allied consulate, it should not harbor a common war criminal of the Allied nations. Therefore, to prevent Simon from escaping, troops have been dispatched to protect the consulate.</p>

<h3>Wu Tiecheng Discusses Impressions of the Plenary Session; Corrects the Communist Party's Misinterpretations of Resolutions</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, Day X] After the close of the Second Plenary Session, the reporter specifically visited Wu Tieshicheng, Secretary-General of the Central Party Headquarters, and asked the following questions:</p>
<p>Q: What are the Secretary-General's impressions of this plenary session?</p>
<p>A: This plenary session discussed the current issues of the country with unprecedented enthusiasm and thoroughness. The main spirit of the meeting has been embodied in various resolutions and briefly listed in the declaration. In short, it is to concentrate the nation's strength and complete the mission of peace and national construction.</p>
<p>Q: Today's Xinhua Daily published the Communist Party's spokesperson's remarks and Mr. Zhou Enlai's remarks, stating that the resolutions of the Second Plenary Session shook the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference. What is the Secretary-General's opinion?</p>
<p>A: I am very surprised by the content of these two remarks and do not know their purpose. The Political Consultative Conference was convened by the government, and the government is in the process of implementing its resolutions. The Second Plenary Session confirmed the report of the Political Consultative Conference and has also made clear resolutions. The government will not only implement the resolutions but also hopes that the Communist Party will abide by them. As for the constitutional issue, it is still in the deliberation stage. The opinions put forward by the Second Plenary Session are also being presented by government representatives to the Constitutional Draft Review Committee to solicit opinions from all parties. Our party believes that the constitution is the goal of the revolution and is related to the country's major plans and must be carefully considered. Furthermore, there was an understanding in the original Political Consultative Conference that if there were better opinions, they could be put forward for joint consultation.</p>
<p>Q: Mr. Zhou Yinlai believes that the members of the National Government should not be elected by the Central Executive Committee. What is the Secretary-General's opinion?</p>
<p>A: According to the laws of the period of political tutelage, the members of the National Government should be elected by the Central Executive Committee of our party. The resolution on the expansion of the government organization in the Political Consultative Conference clearly pointed out in the footnote that the National Government members are "nominated and elected by the Chairman of the National Government." At that time, the common understanding was that they would be elected by the Central Executive Committee of our party. Simply referring to the original text of the Political Consultative Conference resolution would make it clear. Mr. Zhou Enlai's remarks seem to be a deliberate misinterpretation, which is quite regrettable. I don't know how the words "nominated and elected" will be interpreted.</p>
<p>Q: Mr. Zhou Enlai believes that the change of the National Defense Supreme Committee to the Central Political Committee is a "supreme guidance agency for politics" that is to guide the "National Government." Is this statement true?</p>
<p>A: The powers of the National Defense Supreme Committee have been transferred to the National Government Committee. The Central Political Committee is entirely the highest agency for our party to guide party members in politics and does not guide the government. The Communist Party also has a Political Bureau. Mr. Zhou Enlai's remarks are clearly a distortion and deliberately misleading.</p>
<p>Q: Mr. Zhou Enlai also said that the Plenary Session did not mention the issue of human rights at all, and criticized that the National Assembly Organization Law has not been amended. What does the Secretary-General think?</p>
<p>A: There is no need to make a resolution again on matters that the government has decided to implement. The laws restricting the people's freedom during the war are being repealed and amended separately. The government is sending the National Assembly Organization Law to the Legislative Yuan for amendment in accordance with the law.</p>
<p>Q: Mr. Zhou Enlai also said that the National Army did not comply with the ceasefire agreement and cited the words of Mr. Lin Zheng as evidence. Is this true?</p>
<p>A: Which side did not comply with the ceasefire agreement is a fact that the people of the whole country have seen and heard. The military mediation teams in various places also have reports. I hope the Communist Party will tell the truth and do practical things.</p>
<p>Q: Mr. Zhou Enlai said that the report of the Vice Minister of Military Affairs of the Plenary Session on the number of troops did not match the number reported in the Political Consultative Conference, and also said that his report on the troop demobilization plan violated the Political Consultative Conference resolution and the troop consolidation plan of the Military Three-Man Team. Does the Secretary-General think this is true?</p>
<p>A: The National Army currently has 4.9 million people (statistics for December last year). In addition to the 1.1 million people in various military agencies, schools, and the navy and air force, the army has a total of 3.8 million people. After the National Army stopped conscription, desertion and attrition are inevitable. Therefore, the estimated number of demobilizations cannot be calculated in full. The original report estimated that the attrition rate for the next twelve months would be at least 15%, which should be reduced by 570,000 people. The actual number of army personnel should be calculated based on 3.23 million people. When the first phase of the National Army's reorganization is completed, 1.8 million officers and soldiers will be retained, organized into 30 armies, 90 divisions, and special service units. The number of people who should be demobilized and transferred is 1.43 million (including 180,000 officers and 1.25 million soldiers), totaling 3.23 million people. Therefore, there is no error in the number of troops reported at the Political Consultative Conference as 3.8 million people and the total number of people reported at the Second Plenary Session as 4.9 million people, and the number of people transferred as listed in the outline of the troop demobilization plan as 1.43 million. The original outline also calculated the number of people to be transferred in the second phase as 650,000 people based on this principle. As for the troop demobilization plan of the Ministry of Military Affairs, the entire demobilization period is set at 18 months, the first phase is 12 months, demobilizing to 90 divisions, and the second phase is 6 months, demobilizing to 50 divisions. All of this strictly adheres to the troop consolidation plan of the Military Three-Man Team. As for the so-called "Engineering and Construction Corps," it is for officers and soldiers who cannot find jobs to engage in river management, road repair, afforestation, and land reclamation. According to Article 5 of Section 4 of the Political Consultative Conference's Peace and National Construction Program, "The government should plan for the re-employment and employment of demobilized and retired officers and soldiers." Engineering and construction are one of these plans and should never be misunderstood as an independent armed force. Mr. Zhou Enlai's misinterpretation does not need to be deeply refuted and is obvious.</p>
<p>Q: If, as the Secretary-General said, the Second Plenary Session had no intention of shaking the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference at all, why did the Communist Party suddenly launch such a large-scale propaganda offensive?</p>
<p>A: The best thing to do about this matter is to ask the Communist Party spokesperson and Mr. Zhou Enlai. What I can tell you is that every large-scale propaganda offensive by the Communist Party is immediately followed by a new action. It is unpredictable what new action will occur after today's Communist Party propaganda offensive. Try to pay attention to the development of the Northeast issue and the implementation of the unified compilation plan, or you may be able to observe its movements.</p>
<h3>Java War Resumes; Indonesian-Dutch Negotiations Suspended</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper's report] London, 20th Broadcast: The Dutch-Indian and Indonesian negotiations, originally scheduled to be held today, were suddenly suspended. Fierce artillery battles broke out between British-Dutch troops and Indonesian troops in the Sembirong area on the north coast of Java. South of Batavia, Indonesian troops also attacked Indian troops. Indonesian troops in the Surabaya area attacked British troops with tanks and artillery.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Batavia, 20th] The Indonesian Ministry of National Defense and the Ministry of Interior jointly issued a notice yesterday stating that strict measures will be taken against groups of people who "incite propaganda or armed forces" that hinder the development of the Republic of Indonesia.</p>
<h3>India Striving for Freedom; Opportunity Ripe; Vigorously Developing, Impossible to Control; Nehru Hopes Britain Will Abandon Rule</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Singapore, 20th] Nehru hosted reporters here at midnight and gave a speech that lasted two hours. When asked by reporters whether India was willing to accept dominion status, Mr. Nehru said that India's first step was to obtain complete freedom, such as the freedom to choose friends and comrades. Only after complete freedom is obtained can it be decided whether to remain within the British Commonwealth. Mr. Nehru also said that the Indian people completely sympathize with the people of Indonesia, so the presence of Indian troops in Indonesia makes the Indian people feel indignant. When asked by reporters whether he was optimistic about the British Cabinet Mission's trip to India, he replied that he felt that there was a strong force today that was forcing Britain to recognize India's freedom. Smart people all know that holding on to India is gradually losing its benefits and is becoming a burden. Since freedom has come, far-sighted people all want to make it a reality in the most appropriate way and should not prevent it to prevent a backlash. All of this can predict that the next negotiation will produce satisfactory results. However, there are still many British people today who regard themselves as landlords in India. The administrative authorities only know how to collect money and maintain law and order and never pay attention to the progress of the world and the causes of famine. The British government's plan is based on the reports of these administrative authorities. Many people have completely lost faith in the British government and do not believe that this mission can have any results. The people's antipathy has reached an uncontrollable point. The occurrence of famine is also due to improper handling by the authorities. Therefore, the Congress Party is determined not to accept British rule, but we are still willing to conclude agreements with Britain on certain events related to British interests. As for the Indians in Malaya, I can only reiterate the opinions I have previously put forward to Indians in Burma, Ceylon, and other places. Indians in these countries should choose according to law whether they are willing to be nationals of that country or Indian nationals. Mr. Nehru also said that the countries in the Indian Ocean region will gradually form closer relations, including Australia, and India will be its center.</p>

<h3>Reaffirmation of an Enlightened Ethnic Policy</h3>
<p>At the 19th session of the Second Plenary Session of the Chinese Kuomintang, an important resolution was passed, stating: "It is hereby noted that our Mongol, Tibetan, and Hui compatriots are all members of our great Chinese nation, and the regions where they are distributed are an inseparable part of our territory. Our Party has always aimed to support and develop all border compatriots, working hand in hand to achieve prosperity, strength, and happiness. ... Now that the War of Resistance has been won, the responsibility of nation-building should be jointly borne by all our compatriots. In accordance with this purpose, this Congress has carefully reviewed and resolved relevant cases, and based on the spirit of each case and the main points of reports and reviews, decides on the following points, aiming for their swift implementation to achieve the unity and unification of all ethnic groups within the country and lay the foundation for the long-term stability and security of the nation: (1) Under the principle of forming a unified democratic nation based on the Three Principles of the People and the Five-Power Constitution, the Constitution must clearly stipulate and guarantee the autonomous rights of border ethnic groups; (2) The reorganized members of the National Government Committee and the administrative members of the Executive Yuan must include loyal and capable comrades from the Mongol, Tibetan, and Hui ethnic groups; (3) Talented individuals from the Mongol, Tibetan, and Hui ethnic groups must have ample opportunities to participate in the actual work of various Yuan, ministries, and commissions; (4) Appropriately increase the number of representatives from the Mongol, Tibetan, and Hui ethnic groups in the newly added quota of National Assembly representatives, to be selected by the central government; (5) Reorganize the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission into the Ministry of Border Affairs, allowing capable individuals from the Mongol, Tibetan, and Hui ethnic groups to participate in actual work and assume actual responsibility; (6) In education at all levels in areas where border ethnic groups reside, emphasis should be placed on the native languages, with Mandarin as a compulsory subject, to be implemented by the Ministry of Education as appropriate. Official documents of all levels of government should be written in both Mandarin and the native language as a principle; (7) The central government must make reasonable regulations for the autonomous systems in various border areas, based on the actual situation of each area: (A) Regarding the Inner Mongolia region, restore the original Mongolian Local Autonomous Political Affairs Committee and clearly delineate the powers between the League and Banner governments and the provinces and counties; (B) Regarding the Xinjiang region, it should be implemented in accordance with the methods determined for resolving the Xinjiang Provincial Incident; (C) Regarding the Tibetan population under provincial jurisdiction, they should be given real opportunities to participate in provincial and county politics; (8) Special funds should be allocated for various undertakings such as economy, transportation, education, health, and relief in various border areas, and the relevant responsible agencies should be tasked with formulating and implementing plans to promote them promptly; (9) National defense troops stationed in various areas where border ethnic groups reside should be concentrated in several key areas, with rations supplied by the central government, without interfering in local administration. All local security teams should be staffed and trained primarily with members of the local ethnic groups and local people."</p>
<p>The above resolution is of considerable importance, especially today, when various ethnic minorities are often incited to carry out so-called "autonomous" movements. There are no so-called "ethnic minorities" in China like those appearing elsewhere, as our authorities have repeatedly clarified. This Second Plenary Session of the Kuomintang is a concise reaffirmation of the firm policy held by our Standing Committee. It states clearly from the outset: "It is hereby noted that our Mongol, Tibetan, and Hui compatriots are all members of our great Chinese nation." This shows that Mongol, Tibetan, and Hui compatriots are all constituent members of our great Chinese nation, and not "ethnic minorities" outside of our great Chinese nation. This is the core of our entire ethnic policy. Our great Chinese nation is like a large family, and Mongol, Tibetan, and Hui compatriots are all members of this family. All constituent members are as close as brothers and sisters and have the responsibility to maintain this large family.</p>
<p>However, each constituent member, due to historical and geographical factors, often forms its own unique lifestyle and cultural characteristics. If we want to forcibly abandon their inherent culture and lifestyle and force them to conform, from a historical point of view, not only will it fail to achieve practical results, but it will also easily lead to backlash. Moreover, it would be contrary to the peaceful and impartial ideals of the Three Principles of the People, the highest guiding principle of our nation-building. The resolution of this Second Plenary Session of the Kuomintang, in addition to expanding opportunities for border compatriots to participate in the central government, focuses on supporting the autonomy of border compatriots and maintaining their inherent culture and lifestyle. This not only demonstrates the central government's concern for border compatriots but also opens up a broad path for their future development. "In education at all levels in areas where border ethnic groups reside, emphasis should be placed on the native languages... The central government must make reasonable regulations for the autonomous systems in various border areas, based on the actual situation of each area." All that has been said above demonstrates how our central government, while adhering to unity, maintains their original lifestyle and cultural characteristics. This is truly a very wise decision. Because of this resolution, our country's ethnic policy becomes even more clear and should be admired by the world. The negative significance of this policy is that we abandon the assimilation policy with aggressive implications; on the positive side, our ethnic policy is to support the self-development of border compatriots and pay attention to the development of their inherent culture. Today, when centrifugal and divisive movements of "ethnic minorities" are taking place all over the world, it is very timely for us to reaffirm our enlightened ethnic policy at this moment.</p>
<p>Here, we must add that although our ethnic policy mainly targets Mongol, Tibetan, and Hui compatriots, we also regard the various "minority groups" scattered in the southwest and the aboriginal tribes living in Taiwan as members of our great Chinese nation, like brothers and sisters, even though their cultural standards may not be high. How to improve their living standards and enhance their welfare? Now that the central government has decided to establish a Ministry of Border Affairs, it is deeply believed that in the future, with a dedicated agency in charge, things will surely be properly carried out. All constituent members of our great Chinese nation shared weal and woe during the war. Now that the country has embarked on the road to nation-building, it must work hand in hand to achieve prosperity, strength, and happiness. Looking ahead, there are indeed great expectations.</p>
<h3>Eating Grass Roots and Tree Bark to Quench Hunger; China Urgently Awaits Funds; Our Representative Jiang Tingfu Makes a Special Appeal</h3>
<p>[United Press, Atlantic City, 19th] Jiang Tingfu, the Chinese representative to the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA), arrived here to take up the chairmanship of the meeting and declared at the meeting that famine has occurred in China. Before he left the country, letters and telegrams reporting famine had poured in from all over the country. We originally said that famine was unavoidable, but now famine has already begun in China. There are many places where people eat tree bark and grass roots to barely survive, especially in Hunan Province, which is known as a rice-producing area, but is now known for famine. We originally thought that Taiwan could have surplus grain to help other provinces, but now not only has this become a pipe dream, but we also need to transport rice to provide relief.</p>
<p>[United Press International, Atlantic City, 20th] Jiang Tingfu declared at the meeting that Siam has 2.5 million tons of rice in storage, but due to political reasons, it cannot be shipped out. Jiang also said that the lack of rice in the Far East could cause millions of people to die.</p>
<p>[United Press, Atlantic City, 19th] UNRRA Director-General Lehman announced today that the agency has accepted France's invitation to hold its next plenary session in Paris.</p>

<h3>Horrifying! Two Million People Killed in Two and a Half Years; Nazi Concentration Camp Director Admits to Using Gas Chambers for Massacres</h3>
<p>[United Press, Hamburg, Germany, 19th] The British military authority in Hamburg announced tonight that the former director of the Auschwitz concentration camp, Hoess, has signed a confession of a shocking historical massacre case, admitting that from June 1941 to the end of 1943, he gassed two million people to death, all personally arranged by him. Hoess was a lieutenant colonel in the German Nazi stormtroopers. After a major search by the British military authorities in the occupied area, he was arrested in Flensburg ten days ago. His assistant, "the Beast of Belsen" Kramer, was hanged in April. Hoess's confession includes a conversation with the former leader of the German secret police, Himmler. He discussed with Himmler the construction of five large gas chambers and a crematorium. Himmler told Hoess: "These people must be gassed to death, otherwise, in case Germany loses the war, 'the Germans will be wiped out by them.'" When Hoess was questioned, he was asked if he believed in God. He replied: "No, absolutely not!"</p>
<h3>The Gold Dollar Kingdom of Today! Lacking in Material Goods, But Abundant in Idle Funds; Two Hundred Times More Than Six Years Ago</h3>
<p>[United Press, New York, 19th] In 1946, the United States did not feel a lack of anything except for money, so idle funds flooded, and the low interest rates on loans were unprecedented in history. Billions of dollars of idle funds cannot find a way out, causing interest rates to decrease. Very little of this idle money is used to purchase consumer goods because the stock of goods is not abundant and supply cannot meet demand. Theaters, nightclubs, and entertainment venues are overcrowded, retailers' businesses are booming, and more and more people are searching for various goods and making other investments, which is proof that idle funds are abundant. In addition, there are also many buyers of stocks and bonds, making various securities difficult to find. As a result of the abundance of idle funds, the economic departments in the United States are in increasingly difficult situations. Financial institutions such as banks, insurance companies, and trust companies are fiercely opposed to the low-interest rate policy held by the Ministry of Finance, but some companies welcome this policy because they can take the opportunity to issue bonds or pay off old debts at low interest rates. The government also welcomes this policy because it needs to pay interest on the huge amount of public debt it has issued. The total amount of US public debt is 300 billion US dollars, and the annual interest payment is about 2%, which is 6 billion US dollars. If the interest rate is raised to 4%, the annual interest payment will reach 120 million, which is equal to the total amount of public debt issued by the United States in 1918.</p>
<p>It is estimated that the current idle funds in the United States are 200 times more than in 1939. The total amount of cash and negotiable securities is 250 billion US dollars, about four times the amount in 1929. Bond prices continue to rise, and bondholders receive very little interest.</p>

<h3>Higher Court Prosecutor's Office: 110 Traitor Cases Handled and Prosecuted; Approximately 400 More Cases to be Sent for Investigation; War Criminals Tried by Three Courts Based on the Nature of Their Crimes</h3>
<p>[Reported by This Newspaper] Chief Prosecutor Du Bao of the Municipal High Court recently told reporters that as of now, the office has handled more than 170 traitor cases, of which approximately 110 have been prosecuted. Most of these traitors were sent by the police bureau and the Songhu Garrison Headquarters. There are approximately 400 more cases that will soon be transferred to the court by relevant agencies. Currently, all foreigners residing in China from any country in the world must abide by Chinese law because consular jurisdiction no longer exists. Among the criminals investigated by the High Prosecutor's Office, a considerable number are foreigners, one of whom was even the Finnish Consul-General in Shanghai. As for war criminals, Chief Prosecutor Du stated that those whose crimes are only related to China are handled by the recently established military court; if they are only related to the United States, they are handled by the US military court specially authorized by the Chinese government (located in Tilanqiao Shanghai Prison); if their crimes involve more than one country, they are handled by the International Military Tribunal, such as the Tokyo Far East International Military Tribunal.</p>
<p>Military Court Begins Investigation</p>
<p>The Shanghai Military Court held its first investigative hearing for war crime suspects yesterday afternoon at 3 PM after its establishment. A total of four Japanese war criminals were questioned and investigated yesterday afternoon, all of whom were submitted to the court by the Army Headquarters for trial. The names of the four criminals will be kept confidential in accordance with regulations during the investigation period. However, it is understood that all four criminals were arrested among prisoners of war and did not include any former military police officers. As soon as the investigation is completed, a public prosecution will be filed and a public trial will be held. Furthermore, the military court on the fourth floor of the Shanghai Command Post of the headquarters has been prepared under the command of Director Xu Zhenqiu of the military law department and Section Chief Zhang Disheng, and it is expected that the date of the public trial will not be far off.</p>
<p>US Military Continues Trial of Four Japanese War Criminals</p>
<p>Former Commander of the Japanese 13th Army, Sawada Shigeru, and Japanese soldiers Wakou Yuuki, Okada Ryuhei, and Tateta Gaisuke, continued to be tried by the US military court yesterday. Lawyers for the plaintiffs presented a total of 51 pages of evidence, all of which were the testimonies of American pilots obtained by the American War Crimes Tribunal in the United States. In the afternoon, a certain Japanese teacher was also called to testify. He worked in the Japanese military department when the Doolittle pilots were sent to Shanghai in April 1942 and reported on the situation at that time. The case may be retried for another week, and the verdict will be announced next week.</p>
<p>Gao Jinsheng and Others Sentenced</p>
<p>[Reported by This Newspaper] The Criminal Court of the High Court in Tilanqiao held a collegial panel yesterday afternoon at 2 PM and sentenced four cases of colluding with the enemy and serving in relevant military organs: (1) Gao Jinsheng, who was a secret agent for the enemy military police in Yangsiqiao, was sentenced to six years of imprisonment and five years of deprivation of civil rights; (2) Gu Youmou, who was an enemy cook, proficient in Japanese, and translator for the Jiangnan Shipyard, recruited 270 workers for the enemy, was sentenced to ten years of imprisonment and ten years of deprivation of civil rights; (3) Zhu Bingrong, a coppersmith, who served as an intelligence officer for the enemy navy in Shishanlukou, was sentenced to life imprisonment and permanent deprivation of civil rights; (4) Chuan Guangyao, who opened the Longchang copper and tin shop and collected copper coins to aid the enemy, was sentenced to two years of imprisonment and ten years of deprivation of civil rights. In the above four cases, the property of the defendants, after deducting the necessary living expenses for their families, was confiscated.</p>
<p>Zou Zhigao and Others Await Judgment</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] Three cases, in which the defendants were charged with serving as low- and mid-level officials in enemy puppet organizations during the enemy occupation, or were accused of dealing with the enemy due to business relations, were concluded yesterday. They include (1) Zou Zhigao, a native of Shanghai, who served as a recommended technician in the General Affairs Section of the Puppet Ministry of Judicial Administration from 1941 to 1945. The prosecutor indicted him based on his admitted facts, but his daughter, Zou De, provided various facts to refute the charges. The lawyer also argued that he had not harmed the country. (2) Zhang Qipin, a native of Ningbo, 35 years old, was the manager of the Fuxing Nail Factory and was accused of manufacturing nails for the Jiangnan Shipyard of the enemy navy. However, he claimed that he was coerced and monitored by the enemy military police, so he started working. (3) Zou Xiangding, a native of Nanjing, 40 years old, opened a watch shop and was accused of being a detective for the puppet police station. However, several neighbors testified that he had no dealings with the enemy puppet authorities. His lawyer argued that at that time, due to business relations, he may have had a conflict with the personnel of the puppet police station, and among the police stations after the restoration, there are still some former elements, and Zou was handed over to the court by the police station, which is full of injustice. After the debate, all three cases were scheduled to be sentenced on the 27th.</p>

<h3>Childish Ignorance of Danger Leads to Explosion While Playing with a Bomb; Tragic Incident at Hualong Elementary School; Blood Splatters in the Classroom; Nine Students Killed or Injured</h3>
<p>[Reported by This Newspaper] The sixth classroom on the third floor of Hualong Elementary School at 62 Hualong Road is the sixth grade classroom. There are more than fifty students in the whole grade. One of the students, Liu Liyin (14 years old), found a hand grenade shaped like an iron ball in an alley when he arrived at school at around 8 AM yesterday. He became curious and took it to the classroom to show it to his classmates. Those who saw it were young and did not know what it was, and they played with it together. Unexpectedly, they accidentally touched the mechanism, and it suddenly exploded. With a loud noise, iron fragments flew everywhere, causing a major disaster.</p>
<p>Teachers and Students Shocked, Order Disrupted</p>
<p>Male student Liu Liyin (who found the hand grenade) and female student Cui Renqin (14 years old), who died from severe injuries to their back and waist, were killed on the spot in the classroom.

<h3>Universal Traffic Stops Established Next to Zhongzheng Road Trees</h3>

<h3>The Desolate Film Industry: Talent and Finances in Crisis; Directors Unwilling to Work; Fei Mu Considers Writing a Script</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] The various studios of the Chinese Film Company in Shanghai, which operated during the enemy occupation period, have been taken over by the Central Government. The former Lihua Film Studio No. 2 is now Central Film Studio No. 1, and the Tian Tong Road studio in Zhabei is now Studio No. 2. The former Lihua Film Studio No. 3 on Avenue Joffre has been taken over by the China Film Studio of the Political Department of the Military Affairs Commission and renamed Studio No. 1, while the studio on Connaught Road is now Studio No. 2.</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, our reporter visited the famous film director Fei Mu to inquire about his plans for the post-war development of the film industry. According to Fei, the mission of the film industry is of great importance, and film has a significant impact on society and the public, so it must not be treated lightly. Although the Central Government is currently encouraging the revival of the film industry, most filmmakers and producers, directors, and screenwriters are hesitant to start because of a lack of suitable subjects and talent, as well as shortages in funding, equipment, and studio space. There is also a severe shortage of directors and screenwriters. The general public only knows the actors and actresses and does not pay attention to the directors, but the success or failure of a film depends entirely on the director. The low status of directors means that no one will be willing to take on this work.</p>
<p>Regarding the handling of people who worked in the film industry during the enemy occupation, the film industry is currently conducting tests, investigations, and evaluations, and anyone who was actually responsible for enemy-controlled film production will be disqualified.</p>
<p>During the occupation of Shanghai, Fei Mu left the film industry to work in directing plays, and later retired after being threatened by the Japanese, and has remained retired for over a year. Fei has recently been living in seclusion, planning to write a film script. However, according to Fei himself, finding a suitable subject has been quite difficult. Fei is a humble man and says that he needs to study and learn more, and does not want to mention his past work, as he feels he has achieved nothing. Fei is working hard on this script and hopes to have a work to contribute to the public before the summer or fall of this year.</p>
<p>The Central Film Studio will soon begin shooting "The Family of Loyalty and Righteousness," with Qin Yi possibly playing the female lead, and Liu Qiong or Zhao Dan as the male lead.</p>

<h3>Feet/Limp/Eye/Blind/Traveling/Rear/Shouting: Wang Changxi, the "Holy Wounded Warrior," Arrives in Shanghai, Loudly Calling to Awaken the National Soul</h3>
<p>Wang Changxi, the honored veteran known as the "Holy Wounded Warrior" (pictured), arrived in Shanghai from Xi'an at 9 AM yesterday and is temporarily residing at the YMCA on Ba Xian Qiao. Wang is a native of Tangyi, Shandong, who joined the military at a young age and served as a soldier, participating in the battles of Xifengkou, Lugouqiao, and Taierzhuang, among others. He was wounded multiple times, and after recovering, he returned to the front lines. During the Battle of Taierzhuang, he was blinded by tear gas and had both legs disabled by explosives. However, Wang once said: "The enemy can cripple my eyes, but not my mouth; disable my feet, but not my heart." Despite his blindness and lameness, he traveled behind enemy lines, shouting loudly to awaken the national soul. He traveled through the provinces of Hunan, Jiangxi, Fujian, Zhejiang, Guangdong, Yunnan, Sichuan, Guizhou, Shaanxi, and Henan. Everywhere he went, he gave inspirational speeches to schools, government agencies, and organizations, which were welcomed and supported by people from all walks of life. Over the past six or seven years, the慰勞金 (financial support) he received for his inspirational work has reached 46 million yuan. Part of this he donated to the nation, and with another part, he founded Changxi Charity Schools in Hengyang, Hunan; Quanzhou, Guangxi; and Baoji, Shaanxi, to accommodate the children of honored veterans and impoverished children. It is said that Wang's visit to Shanghai will include spiritual speeches to the public at major schools, entertainment venues, and factories, as well as an exhibition of his personal achievements in resisting Japan over the past seven years, which are the crystallization of his efforts.</p>

<h3>20 Million Yuan Robbery Case Solved in a Shed in Hongzhen</h3>
<p>Five Suspects Arrested, Stolen Goods Recovered</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] The De Kang Paint Factory at No. 113 Dongjiazhai Road in the suburbs of Shanghai was formerly established by the enemy and was taken over by the Ministry of Economic Affairs after the victory. At 0:30 AM on the 11th of last month, a large number of bandits suddenly tied up the employees stationed at the factory and loaded about 30 barrels of large and small sulfide metals, worth over 20 million yuan, onto a truck and fled. On the 23rd, Zhang Kechang, a plainclothes police sergeant from the Second Unit of the Tilanqiao Sub-bureau, discovered that several suspects related to the case were hiding in a shed at No. 27 Miaohou Road in Hongzhen. Under the orders of Sub-bureau Chief Zhang Renyou, Unit Chief Sun Wendou personally led Inspector Yang Fusheng and other officers to the above location in the rain. They arrested five people on the spot, including Pan Ganquan, who confessed to being involved in the robbery. They recovered 26 barrels of sulfide metals. The suspects have been transferred to the Garrison Headquarters for legal prosecution.</p>
<h3>Gunned Down Male Corpse Found on Zhongshan Road</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning, at dawn, an unidentified male corpse was found in front of the Qiaojiazhai gate, north of Zhongshan Road, Cao Xi Road, in western Shanghai. Qiao Haisheng, the local bailiff, reported the incident to the Xujiahui Police Sub-bureau, which dispatched plainclothes police officers to investigate. The corpse was approximately 20 years old, wearing a blue striped woolen suit and black leather shoes, with three gunshot wounds to the head and waist. The head was facing south and the feet facing north, lying in a pool of blood. A business card from "Xu Li" was found on the body, and whether this is the name of the deceased and the truth of the murder are currently under investigation. The corpse has been sent to the Tongren Auxiliary Yuan Hall for autopsy.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper Report] Zhuo Qingbao, the chief of the Detective Division of the Municipal Police Bureau, recently dispatched officers Feng Qishan and Chen Guangrong to arrest six pickpockets, including Shen Jinf, Li Longfa, Gu Afu, Zhang Baogen, Qian Zhifang, and Song Fulin, at the International Hotel, Hall &amp; Holtz, and Nanjing Road. They confiscated a watch, a lighter, three Parker fountain pens, one Huada Men fountain pen, one Xinmin fountain pen, and two Piluo Tai fountain pens, all of which were stolen goods. The suspects confessed that they used selling embroidered goods as a cover for picking pockets, targeting American soldiers. After interrogation, it was confirmed that this was the case, and they have been transferred to the court. The owners can report their losses to the court to claim their lost items.</p>
<h3>Admiral Kirk Returns from Inspecting U.S. Military Missions</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] Admiral Kirk, commander of the U.S. Seventh Fleet, returned to Shanghai after inspecting the U.S. Navy situation in Qingdao, Qinhuangdao, Tanggu, Tianjin, and Beiping. Yesterday afternoon at 4 PM, he hosted a reception for local reporters on the fifth floor of the Cathay Hotel.</p>
<p>Visited MacArthur in Tokyo</p>
<p>Admiral Kirk stated that the main task of his trip to North China was to inspect the situation of the U.S. Navy in various North China ports, such as transporting Chinese troops, repatriating Japanese troops, training the Chinese Navy in Qingdao, supplying the Marine Corps in various areas, and the situation of the U.S. Army in Korea. He not only urged these matters, but also ensured that they complied with the U.S. demobilization plan. Admiral Kirk also visited Marshal Special Envoy and General MacArthur in Tokyo and inspected the port of Pusan in southeastern Korea.</p>
<p>Trained Naval Personnel to Return to China</p>
<p>To date, the U.S. Navy has transported seven Chinese armies, totaling 220,000 personnel, to North China, and 800 Chinese naval personnel are being trained in Qingdao. 1,100 Chinese naval personnel being trained in the U.S. will return to China in early April, sailing eight or ten warships gifted to China under the Lend-Lease Act. The number of U.S. Navy personnel and ships in China is gradually decreasing. However, this has no major impact on their work. Due to the decrease in personnel and ships, the number of Japanese and Korean civilians and military personnel being repatriated, and the transportation of food and Chinese military equipment, is not large.</p>
<p>Fewer Incidents with Sailors Expected</p>
<p>After the U.S. Seventh Fleet completes its mission in China, it will continue to defend various ports in the western Pacific, while the Fifth Fleet will defend the eastern Pacific. Admiral Kirk stated that the behavior of U.S. sailors has improved greatly in the past two months, but some are new personnel with slightly poorer discipline, and having been at sea for a long time, they are prone to transgressions once on land. Thanks to the close cooperation of the Chinese authorities and the U.S. military police, it is expected that there will be fewer incidents in the future.</p>
<h3>Mastermind of the Shooting of a Policeman Arrested</h3>
<p>Wu Qilin, a police officer from the Xujiahui Police Sub-bureau, was suddenly attacked by thugs and shot three times while on duty at Hongqiao Garden on Hongqiao Road at 4 PM on January 31. The case had not yet been solved. Chief Chen ordered Chen Kaizhou, the chief of the judicial section, to lead Inspector Ma Yiqiu and others to investigate. On the previous day, plainclothes police officers Shen Fuxing and Yuan Genbao arrested the mastermind of the case, Cao Jindi, a local resident, and Wu Tongsheng and Ye Miaosheng, in the Tangzijing area. They also confiscated two pistols and seven bullets. Other accomplices are still at large and are currently being pursued.</p>
<h3>Dispute Arises from the U.S. Army Transportation Department Firing Drivers</h3>
<p>Shen Yifang, a driver for the U.S. Army Transportation Department at No. 100 Meyers Road, was suddenly fired the day before yesterday. When the remaining workers inquired with the authorities about the reason, the employer refused to answer. The workers requested that Shen Yifang be retained, but this was rejected, and all of the drivers' licenses were taken away, forcing over 1,200 drivers to stop working. Yesterday morning, worker representatives and representatives from the drivers' union petitioned the Social Affairs Bureau, which dispatched personnel at 11 AM to negotiate, but they were also refused. It is reported that the workers will form a Forced Work Stoppage Committee to appeal to all sectors of society.</p>
<h3>Director of the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau Explains the Labor Movement Issues; Press Conference Hosted by the Municipal Government News Liaison Group</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] Yesterday, the Municipal Government News Liaison Group, formerly known as the News Release Group of the Municipal Government, held its first press conference in the Municipal Government Auditorium, with Wu Kaixian, Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, in attendance to report on and explain the labor movement issues. He stated that the frequent labor movements in various industries in recent months are mainly due to economic factors. According to statistics from the Social Affairs Bureau, the more volatile the prices, the more labor movements occur. Therefore, the Social Affairs Bureau is now working hard to encourage various industries to adopt cost-of-living-based salary systems to stabilize the lives of employees and protect them from the impact of price fluctuations. Industries such as public utilities, cotton mills, flour mills, and department stores have already implemented cost-of-living indices with great success. In addition, the factory conference system in the Factory Law is being promoted, with representatives from both labor and management forming a committee to resolve all labor welfare, salary increase disputes, etc., to promote labor-management cooperation. Director Wu expressed his determination to achieve equal pay for equal work to ensure fairness and avoid labor disputes. Regarding the astonishingly high wages of Western-style tailors and the arbitrary increase in prices by the barbers' association to more than 10,000 times the level of 1937, Director Wu promised to intervene. Finally, Zhu Xubai of the News Liaison Group announced that a press conference would be held again at 3 PM today in the Municipal Government Auditorium.</p>

<h3>On-the-Spot Report from Haimen Reader: Riverbank Collapse Presents Perilous Situation</h3>
<p>— Huang Zongwen</p>
<p>Appeals to the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration or Water Conservancy Association to Send Personnel for Survey</p>
<p>Haimen in northern Jiangsu, located between Nantong and Qidong, is bordered by the Yangtze River to the south, with waves reaching the sky, truly a coastal life. Unfortunately, in recent years, the river tides have been abnormal, and the water flow is rapid, like a landslide or tsunami. Along the river, farmland is collapsing into the water. Good land and beautiful scenery are gradually being eroded by the river tide, gradually turning into nothing. Locals call it "sea collapse." People say, "Sea collapse takes everything, fire burns half," which shows the depth of the disaster. The author is a native of Haimen and one of the victims, forced to come to Shanghai to make a living. Recently, returning home to visit relatives, I was able to mourn and survey the situation. The riverbanks are steep, and the water is over ten feet deep. The land on the bank has deep and wide cracks, with the immediate danger of collapsing. I hardly dared to approach. The vast farmland along the river is desolate and cannot be planted because before the seedlings mature, the land will belong to the Dragon King of the Sea. Now, the victims are everywhere, displaced, some committing suicide, some becoming beggars, and even some taking risks. The misery is indescribable. I am requesting that your newspaper disclose this situation and urge the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration or the Water Conservancy Association to send personnel to investigate the disaster situation along the river in Haimen as soon as possible and find ways to build dikes and prevent disasters, which would be as benevolent as a rebirth for the millions of living beings there.</p>

The husband has been gone for six years without news, and she is extremely anxious. Life is also difficult to continue! Victory in the War of Resistance, the sky is bright again.

<h3>Gold Notes Show Little Fluctuation; Hong Kong Exchange Recovering in the Afternoon; Textile Factory Jardine Matheson Buys</h3>
<p>Yesterday's market was sluggish. Before noon, only 20,000 trades started. The Bank of China was still allocating at a price of 1.6 million, so the traders felt it difficult to accept this price, which was slightly higher than the black market. Therefore, although the total number of registered trades was 200, the actual number of transactions was probably small. During the session, the selling price was 1.6 million, and after the opening, the situation was sluggish. It was difficult to buy in at a price of 1.58 million. During the Bank of China's allocation, the price was around 1.59 million. Therefore, although traders registered, some traders did not accept. After that, the market was as dead as a bear until noon, when it was still around 1.59 million. In the afternoon, it struggled for a long time around 1.58 million, but finally, with looser money supply and more buyers taking advantage of the low prices, it only fell by 10,000. The listed price for gold ornaments was still 173,000 yuan, silver 1,600 yuan, and silver dollars rose to around 950 yuan. The discount was more balanced than yesterday, with interest rates of about 18% to 21%.</p>
<p>There was no change in foreign currency. U.S. dollars opened at 2,000 yuan with sellers, then fell 10 yuan after opening. Trading was limited. In the afternoon, it continued to fall, hovering around 1,980 yuan, and fell 15 yuan compared to the previous close. The U.S. exchange rate was still flat. Old Manchukuo notes continued to prosper, and major players were competing to buy new notes. There was a sudden surge in price. Notes from 1937 rose to 155 yuan, and those from 1938 rose to 153 yuan, then hovered slightly. However, the market rebounded again in the afternoon. It was rumored that a certain textile factory and Jardine Matheson had bought a lot. As a result, old notes were good for 5 yuan, and new notes surged 35 yuan. Hong Kong Electric was 455 yuan and Rubicon was 555 yuan.</p>
<h3>Stocks in a Rising Tide</h3>
<p>Although public bonds were slightly stable, major players did not come in with rumors of investment, so the market temporarily remained quiet. Type C bonds opened at 1,750 yuan, with a high price of 1,780 yuan before falling more than 100 yuan. The process was mediocre and extremely boring. Until noon, it was still hovering below 1,650 yuan, and the result was similar to the previous close. Types A, B, D, and E bonds rebounded slightly. After the bulk transfer of Chinese stock chips the previous day, the market was even more exhausted yesterday. Operators were short of goods, and as soon as there were buyers, the price immediately increased. As for various speculations, bullish or bearish, they were all in the stream of nervous people. There was strong buying yesterday, and all the gloom was dispelled. Idle funds were active, and banks had more new money on hand and insisted on not releasing it. There were more monks than porridge. Yongxing Yarn rose from 3,900 yuan, Meiya at 2,950 yuan, Jingfu at 2,350 yuan, Xinguang at 2,200 yuan, and Qinxing at 1,650 yuan, gradually shifting from fatigue to stability. Around noon, the search for idle funds became even more urgent, and the surge was even greater. The midday close ended at high prices. As a result, the closing prices had continued to increase by 15% to 20%. Great China Match was a leader in manufacturing stocks, and the bottom price was extremely cheap. With the help of banks, it suddenly jumped by about 30% yesterday. In the afternoon, transactions to settle the next day were higher with Yongxing Yarn at 4,500 yuan, Meiya at 3,600 yuan, Jingfu at 2,750 yuan, Xinguang at 2,500 yuan, and Qinxing at 2,000 yuan. After these major players gained their desired amount, they released it, all selling at high prices. The peak was difficult to sustain, and it eventually fell by half. Foreign stocks jumped by 10% as soon as they opened. Chinese stocks were quickly followed by active players. Although operators were mostly nervous, they all echoed the movement where there was profit. Except for Steel Asia, which slightly fell after increasing, almost all ended at high prices. As a result, prices had jumped 10% to 15% higher.</p>
<h3>Cotton Yarn Stops Falling and Starts to Rise; Textile Construction Continues to Open; Piece Goods Sales Sluggish</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the yarn market rebounded and rose. The continuous spring rain suddenly cleared, and sales expanded as a result. Yarn prices stopped falling and started to rise. 20-count Double Horse yarn rebounded to 1.12 million, closing 100,000 higher than yesterday. Other counts of yarn also recovered by 30,000 to 50,000. It is said that a ship will go directly to Guangdong within the day, so Cantonese merchants are eagerly stocking up.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Textile Construction Company continued to sell flannel, serge, silk, Hainsworth, blankets, etc., a total of 25 kinds, and added 7 kinds of cotton cloth. The selling prices were lower than the market price. Cotton yarn will be sold as usual today.</p>
<p>Yesterday, New York American cotton fluctuated up and down by three to five points. Near-term American cotton was 26.75, far-term was 26.61, and Middling spot was 2.30. Transactions of local cotton were reduced. Only Shenxin Yarn Factory purchased Zhangde cotton at 100,500, Sanyu Town cotton at 96,000, and Dafeng American upland cotton at 95,000. The above prices are factory prices. Textile Construction Company did not take any action. Zhoupu seed cotton was still priced at 17,000 yuan. The market price was slightly different from yesterday. Sales of cotton cloth were sluggish, because the price of American Memphis cotton in Sichuan was only 100,000 yuan, while the Shanghai price was 95,000 yuan. After deducting interest, wharfage, taxes, etc., there was no profit to be made, so it is feared that the cloth market will be difficult to revive in the short term.</p>
<h3>Notice to Importers</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Since the Central Bank opened the foreign exchange market, it has also stipulated regulations for import and export trade, which are handled in accordance with the "Provisional Measures for Import and Export Trade." For imports, in addition to goods that are freely imported and prohibited from being imported, for goods that are permitted to be imported, an application must be made to the Customs for a permit before foreign exchange can be purchased. The Customs has established an Import Goods Management Office the day before yesterday, with Director of the Customs Administration, Zhang Fuyun, concurrently serving as Director. The reporter specifically visited Mr. Zhang yesterday. According to him, after the establishment of the office, it will handle applications for permits for five kinds of imported goods, namely: (1) kerosene, (2) sugar, cube sugar, and rock candy, (3) flue-cured tobacco, (4) passenger cars and their chassis (passenger cars refer to those with a factory price of less than US$1,200), and (5) censored films. The preliminary procedures have been handled since the day before yesterday until the 25th, first handling the registration of import firms. The office has printed a registration application form for filling out, which is divided into eight items, namely: (1) name of the import firm, (2) nationality, (3) address, (4) capital, (5) person in charge, (6) date of establishment of the import firm in China, (7) goods for which import permits are applied, (8) previous import quantity (state the country of import, the quantity and value of imports from 1932 to 1936 and after October 1945. If the import firm was established after 1932, the annual import quantity for the first five years after establishment should be reported). After the registration date expires, the applications will be reviewed, and the number of qualified import firms will be determined. The registration issue for newly organized import firms is still under consideration. The quantity of various permitted imports may be based on the average annual import quantity of our country before the war. He said that the matter of permitting imports has no precedent to follow, and everything is in the initial stage of trial operation. In the future, all parts of the country will be handled in a unified manner. He himself is eager to handle matters impartially to facilitate the business community. As for the taxation of permitted imports, it will be handled in accordance with the Customs Tariff promulgated in 1934. In addition, prohibited imports that have been ordered from abroad before March 1 of this year are uniformly limited to be imported before the end of March. Imports after the deadline will be prohibited. Other goods that are free to enter and for which permits can be applied are not subject to this restriction.</p>
<h3>British Control of Cotton Imports</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Liverpool, 20th] The British government has decided to establish a permanent central control commission to manage the import and distribution of cotton. The Lancashire trade community was shocked to learn of this news. It is estimated that at least 400 commercial firms will be prohibited from operating.</p>
<h3>Flannel is in Demand; Lack of Market Goods Makes Prices Expensive</h3>
<p>Flannel has recently been in demand due to warmer weather. Tailors are increasing their purchases due to frequent sales. Gray is in particular demand. However, the market goods are very scarce. Mainland merchants have very little in stock, and consignment merchants are also not well-stocked. Therefore, the market price is very high, and most of the time there is a market but no goods.</p>
<h3>After a Long Rain, the Price of Rice Falls Back</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the rice market, because the weather cleared, and the previous hundred or so rice boats detained in Huangdu were all released, the source was unblocked, the arrival of goods was enthusiastic, and people's hearts softened. The price of japonica and indica rice fell by 2,000 yuan or more. In particular, the early, thin rice from the southern merchants was the most sluggish. However, white yuan rice was scarce and still held firm. Transactions of flour were few, and the price was flat and tired. The oil market also rebounded by a small 1,000 yuan or so. Raw Shantou and Qingdao spot goods were sold, and the market situation was sluggish. The arrival of soybean oil was still small, and soybeans turned into a tired situation, falling by another 400 to 500 yuan. Soybean cake rebounded by a small 100 yuan or so. Wheat bran was flat. Mung beans and sesame seeds had little fluctuation. However, high-quality raw oil was very popular and continued to rise by more than 2,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Sugar Prices Slightly Tight</h3>
<p>The price of sugar has been loose for several days, but yesterday it rebounded slightly. For example, the price of medium sugar and white sugar once reached 49,000 yuan the day before yesterday, but yesterday it was over 49,500 yuan. Four-and-a-half white sugar was tighter due to the shortage of goods. The asking price was 85,000 to 86,000 yuan. Sales of labeled goods were few.</p>
<h3>White Lead Sheet; Shortage of Goods Drives up Prices</h3>
<p>Imports of Belgian white lead sheets have been interrupted for as long as seven or eight years. Therefore, the existing inventory in this street is becoming more and more depleted, and the market price is rising steadily, exceeding the red price by three or five times, depending on the amount of demand. For example, the demand for No. 9 and No. 10 for printing houses is very large, so the price is also the highest, currently asking 4.3 million yuan per barrel. No. 8 is asking 3.2 million yuan per barrel. No. 2 thin colored sheets have a large number of sheets and are widely used, and are currently selling for 3 million yuan per barrel. The prices of No. 6 and No. 18 and No. 19 are similar, all around 2.2 million yuan. The former is used by battery factories, and the latter is used exclusively for zinc sheets. The usage of No. 12, No. 14, and No. 16 are less, so the selling price is the lowest, only 1.5 to 1.6 million per barrel.</p>
<p>Education and Sports</p>
<h3>Sichuan Provincial College of Education to Become the Capital University; Sichuan Provincial Assembly Details Reasons and Makes Recommendations to the Government</h3>
<p>[Dahua News Agency, Chongqing] The Sichuan Provincial College of Education was recently recommended by the Sichuan Provincial Assembly to be changed to the Capital University. The reasons are as follows: (1) After the victory, the major secondary schools in Sichuan moved back. The College of Education should be expanded into the Capital University to facilitate the enrollment of Sichuan youth. (2) Sichuan has now been designated as a model province. In order to adapt to reality, a large number of construction talents should be cultivated. Changing it to the Capital University has this mission. (3) After returning to the capital, in order to promote the great achievements of Sichuan, a Capital University should be established and used as a memorial. (4) The college has substantial equipment and many faculty members, so it is easy to change it to the Capital University. The provincial government has decided to adopt this proposal, and Minister Zhu of the Ministry of Education has also stated that it is necessary to rebuild it, so filing the case will not be a problem.</p>
<h3>Student Unrest at Yingshi University Continues Intermittently</h3>
<p>Resumption of Classes Possible Only Next Week</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Yongjia Special Report] After the overall victory, National Yingshi University moved from Taishun County in southern Zhejiang to Yongjia City to find a place to hold classes. Soon after, student unrest occurred. The student union called for the expulsion of Principal Du Zuozhou. After the school authorities reported the situation to the Ministry of Education for verification, they received an order from the Ministry to punish the students who caused the incident according to the circumstances. The school authorities then expelled five radical students, Zhang Botan, Zhu Shuping, Zhang Dali, Ye Shuzi, and Xiang Chu. The students then went on strike and paraded in the streets, shouting slogans, posting slogans, attacking the principal, and opposing the expulsion of classmates. According to people familiar with the matter, the student unrest at Yingshi University this time was caused by Principal Du's excessive emphasis on emotion. His appointment of a small number of faculty members was very unsatisfactory, and when the students suggested reforms to him, he was unable to deal with it thoroughly due to considerations of face, thus arousing public anger and causing student unrest, which was not due to any major inferior performance on his part. The school site has been determined to be Jinhua. The student unrest continues intermittently. After negotiations, the school has agreed to withdraw the expulsion of the students, and resumption of classes may be possible only next week.</p>
<h3>Guangdong Commemorates Huang Keqiang and Plans to Establish Xinghan Middle School</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Guangzhou] Revolutionary martyr Huang Keqiang and his wife, Ms. Xu Zonghan, have made contributions to the party and the country, which are admired by China and foreign countries. Recently, Wu Hanzhen and other enthusiastic education celebrities, in view of the victory in the war and the primacy of education, specifically planned to establish "Xinghan Memorial Middle School" in Guangzhou to commemorate the martyrs and focus on cultivating national construction talents and helping general out-of-school youth. A preparatory meeting was held a few days ago, and Hua Zhenzhong, Liang Bingxian, and other 12 people were elected as preparatory committee members, and Wu Hanzhen, Feng Suan, and Bao Zhaohua were appointed as standing committee members to start the preparatory work immediately.</p>
<h3>National Central Institute of Technology Strikes Again; 1,300 People Go to the Ministry to Petition</h3>
<p>Will Cooperate with the Women's Normal School in Demands</p>
<p>[Dahua News Agency, Chongqing] The National Central Institute of Technology was recently ordered by the Ministry to stay in Sichuan for operation. The teachers and students were disappointed to hear the news. The school once went on strike in mid-December last year over the issue of relocation. Later, Minister Zhu telegraphed Principal Wei Yuanguang and promised to move back to Nanjing before classes resumed. The Ministry of Education also ordered the school to prepare a rehabilitation plan. Now the Ministry has ordered it to stay in Sichuan, and all teachers and students believe that the disposition is inappropriate. After several discussions among the students, it was decided to go on strike for the second time, and together with the students from the Dongjiaxi branch of the school, a total of more than 1,300 people, went to the Ministry of Education to petition and made strong appeals to the relevant authorities. It happened that the National Women's Normal School was dissolved by the Ministry of Education due to the relocation turmoil, and the students organized a school protection group to come to Chongqing. Therefore, the two schools will cooperate and demand that the Ministry of Education give an explanation quickly.</p>

<h3>Such is Changsha! People Flow Like a Tide, Wandering and Unable to Find a Home</h3>
<p>— Special Dispatch from Changsha, 9th of this month, Anonymous Contributor</p>
<p>Changsha, after four battles, seems to be gradually returning to prosperity on the surface, with bustling streets and people rubbing shoulders. People are flowing into Changsha like a tide, exacerbating the already serious "housing problem." The rise in food prices, due to the population concentration leading to a supply-demand imbalance, seems to be closely related. However, there are other important factors contributing to the soaring food prices. The eleven lakeside counties, known as the granary of Hunan, recently sent representatives to the provincial government requesting exemption from purchasing military grain, citing their meager reserves and inability to supply. This area, known for its abundant rice production, is now crying out about a grain shortage – isn't that surprising? Actually, it's not surprising at all.</p>
<p>Empty Rooms and No Green Grass in the Fields</p>
<p>From the Xiang-Gui campaign the year before last to the Xiang-Xi battle last summer, this province has suffered deeply from banditry. Moreover, last year, various counties experienced droughts, floods, windstorms, and insect plagues. People who fled and returned found themselves unable to survive. Even the Dongting Lake area, nicknamed "the granary," felt a sense of "empty rooms and no green grass in the fields." The situation in other barren mountainous areas is even more imaginable. The mandatory purchase of huge amounts of military grain further exacerbates the grain shortage. According to a clear order from the central government, this province's field tax has been waived this year. However, each county must shoulder the burden of purchasing 3.6 million shi of military grain at a low price of over 20 yuan per shi. This heavy burden weighs down on the shoulders of Hunan farmers. Of course, the mandatory purchase of military grain is a reality. In this province alone, there are currently 200,000 stationed and transit troops, and the number of Japanese prisoners will soon reach 100,000. The daily grain demand is enormous. This grain source cannot rely on provinces like Sichuan and Guizhou and must rely on the local province. However, due to the limited grain reserves in this province, this large-scale purchase has resulted in drastic fluctuations in grain prices. The spring famine this year has been so prolonged that we are worried about even more serious phenomena occurring in the future. It is said that in Shaping, only thirty or forty li away from this city, there have already been tragic incidents of people eating grass and tree roots.</p>
<p>Robbers are Abundant around Tongxiang</p>
<p>Crossing the Xiang River to the western suburbs, the area around Meitong Township is rife with bandits. In the past month, there have been more than a dozen robbery cases, causing travelers to hesitate. The number of people forced into risky behavior due to the pressure of life is increasing. The provincial government seems to be very concerned about the grain issue. Chairman Wu Qiwai said in a press conference that the provincial government has reduced the military grain quota from 3.6 million shi by about one million shi to alleviate the suffering of the people. At the same time, he urged the people of Hunan to actively purchase grain. The current reality is such a contradiction. If the purchase of military grain is delayed for too long, intermittently, there will be more opportunities for grain prices to fluctuate, and grain prices will never be stable. In reality, the people of Hunan currently do not have the strength to make a large-scale supply. As grain prices rise, other commodity prices also fluctuate.</p>
<p>Small Capital to Maintain Appearances</p>
<p>The business situation has not increased the elements of prosperity. Stores with strong capital are "as rare as morning stars" when searching through Changsha today. After the catastrophe, nineteen out of ten are partnerships of small capital, collecting some goods to maintain appearances. According to the person in charge of the Chamber of Commerce, before the war, there were more than 80 businesses in this city, but less than half have applied for registration, and the rest are unable to recover. The Chamber of Commerce once telegraphed the Ministry of Finance requesting a two million yuan allocation for revolving relief, but there has been no response to date. The weak purchasing power of the people is naturally the reason for the commercial depression. Chairman Wu of the provincial government made the following statistics at another reception: Among the 78 counties and cities in the province, 54 were attacked and disturbed by the enemy, and the remaining 24 counties, such as Yuanling, Chenxi, and Zhijiang, were heavily bombed by enemy planes. More than 570,000 people died directly from the enemy's actions, and the number of indirect deaths has not yet been calculated. The total value of various material losses reached 113,264,560,499,980 yuan. This statistic cannot be seen as an exaggeration. Taking Changsha as an example, according to Mayor Li's report: more than 90% of the houses were destroyed. The broken walls and rubble are a desolate sight. The vitality of the people has been greatly damaged, and Changsha accurately reflects this trauma.</p>
<p>Building Low Houses to Shelter from Wind and Rain</p>
<p>Now, hundreds of thousands of people have returned to Changsha and are starting to rebuild their homes from the desolate ruins. Silently and arduously, they collect the remaining bricks and tiles and build low houses on the ruins that are as small as pigeon cages, barely enough to shelter from the wind and rain. The owners of the ruins have returned, immediately calling them ... [illegible characters]. Their lives are like rootless duckweed, floating uncertainly. This is the current Changsha situation ... [illegible characters]. There are not many who return with large sums of gold and legal tender to build large buildings. Remote streets and alleys, except for temporary sheds, are always deserted. The stores on both sides of the street, such as South Zheng Road, Central Zheng Road, East Chang Road, and Zhongshan Road, are mostly built in a crude and makeshift manner. This is due to the depletion of the strength of the people. How easy is it to recover the grand spectacle! "Housing shortage" is the most serious problem in Changsha today. Many people who return to Changsha feel that this problem is not easy to solve. Due to the relationship between supply and demand, rents have risen. Not only is the rent calculated entirely in rice, but a small room where one can sit knee-to-knee costs at least six or seven dou of rice per month, and you must pay in advance for the next month, or half a year. This greatly increases the hardship of tenants. Due to the housing shortage, construction companies have sprung up like mushrooms after the rain.</p>
<p>Mobile Homes Eagerly Awaited in Hunan</p>
<p>Citizens are watching how the Farmers Bank's housing construction loans will be implemented, how the Hunan Post-War Relief Branch will expand the construction of low-income housing, and whether the shipment of American mobile homes to Hunan will truly materialize.</p>
<h3>Scientific Shipbuilding Industry Achieves High Success: British Shipbuilding Research Association Establishes New Goals</h3>
<p>[Translated by this Newspaper's Translation Department] The products of the Clyde shipyards in the United Kingdom are world-famous. The giant ships they have built one after another, such as the "Aquitania," the "Lusitania," the "Queen Mary," and the "Queen Elizabeth," were the largest and fastest at the time of their appearance. However, the reputation enjoyed by the shipyards on the northeast coast of England is no less than that of Clyde. They are scattered in Belfast, Birkenhead, Barrow, and other places, and have unique achievements, becoming models for the shipbuilding industry worldwide.</p>
<p>Location of Shipyards</p>
<p>When establishing a shipbuilding industry in any country, the geographical location of the shipyard is very important. The location for establishing a shipyard must meet two conditions: First, for the convenience of launching, there must be an easy waterway to the ocean. Second, the nearby area must have the main raw materials available for use. The ships of the past were all made of wood, so shipyards were everywhere in the small harbors along the British coast because Britain produced a lot of wood, and there were no problems with raw materials. Later, the raw materials for shipbuilding changed from wood to iron, and then to steel. Naturally, the shipyards far from the steel production areas gradually declined, and the shipyards near these production areas, such as the Tyne, Tees, and Clyde, quickly prospered.</p>
<p>Shipyards and Dry Docks</p>
<p>In 1935, 158 shipyards in the UK started work, mostly specializing in the manufacture of ships for inland navigation. In 1939, there were 50 shipyards manufacturing seagoing vessels, 30 of which manufactured between 10,000 and 50,000 gross tons annually, about 10 manufactured between 50,000 and 100,000 tons, 6 manufactured between 100,000 and 150,000 tons, and 4 manufactured more than 150,000 tons. The number and size of dry docks also vary from factory to factory. The largest shipyards have more than 20 docks, several of which are more than 1,000 feet long.</p>
<p>Wartime Shipbuilding Program</p>
<p>During the war, Britain's shipbuilding program was different from that of the United States or Canada. They did not focus solely on quantity. To meet the various needs of wartime transport, Britain manufactured various merchant ships, including refrigerated ships, crane ships, merchant aircraft carriers, tankers, tugboats, and various other small ships. Because these ships had special performance and designs that needed to be modified from time to time, almost all the skills of the British shipbuilding industry were applied during manufacturing, and the experience gained from this hard work is very valuable in the world's shipbuilding industry.</p>
<p>Froude Institute</p>
<p>Since 1871, the UK has started systematic research in the shipbuilding industry. In that year, William Froude was commissioned by the British Admiralty to build the first new type of test boat. In 1912, the UK founded the Froude Institute in memory of the engineer's contributions. Now, the institute has become part of the National Physical Laboratory. Many new types of merchant ships have been sent here for inspection at the beginning of construction. In 1936, the UK built more than 1.18 million tons of ships, of which 920,000 tons (78%) were based on the inspections in this research institute. Among other companies, the number of ship drawings submitted for inspection reached as many as 88 types.</p>
<p>Shipbuilding Research Association</p>
<p>In 1944, a British Shipbuilding Research Association was established, which is a joint organization of all shipbuilding-related groups in the UK. Their goal is to "enable the UK to achieve the highest degree of achievement in the scientific shipbuilding industry." These groups include the Shipbuilding Employers' Federation, the Admiralty, shipyards, ship repair yards, technical associations, etc. They are working together to overcome all difficulties, and they will enable "Made in the UK" seagoing vessels to continue to maintain their reputation in the shipping industry.

<p>Free Talk: Special Issue on Women and the Family</p>
<p>Family</p>
<h3>Democratized Love</h3>
<p>— Juan Liu</p>
<p>The love of parents is the purest and greatest love in the world. It requires no conditions, no price. But unfortunately, in Chinese families where education is backward and most are still dominated by feudal ideas, many parents' innate pure love is tainted and damaged by traditional selfish ideas. They regard their children as their possessions. Children are placed in a position of absolute subordination and absolute control, with no independent personality, no freedom, no rights. They regard selfishness as love and confuse selfishness with love.</p>
<p>They despise their children's knowledge and ability to work, believing that their views are all wrong, constantly criticizing their opinions and interfering with their actions everywhere. They want their children to obey their preconceived notions and force them to believe in their arbitrary judgments. They believe that their children are not competent in everything, and they worry about everything and do everything for them. They devote themselves wholeheartedly and make unnecessary sacrifices for their children. But at the same time, they deprive their children of their will and freedom of action, blocking the development of their personality and ability. However, in the eyes of those parents, they believe that their sacrifices are entirely for the sake of loving their children. In fact, their main motivation is a selfish subconscious. The so-called "love" is just reason borrowing it to "rationalize" their behavior, so that children have no choice but to submit under this high-sounding term.</p>
<p>This kind of love, which is carried out in the name of love but is actually selfish, is nothing less than a chain for the children, causing them great pain that they dare not resist. For the sake of "not disobeying their parents' wishes," countless young people's happiness has been ruined, countless young people's talents have been buried, and countless young people's futures have been missed. We would rather lose love than accept this masked "kindness."</p>
<p>Of course, children's knowledge, experience, ability to work, and self-control are often insufficient. However, parents can only be in a position of advice, guidance, and assistance. True love is based on the principle of not harming children's independent personality, reasonable freedom, and rights. This kind of love is "democratized love," which can benefit children and gain their faith. Even though parents do not exert pressure, they will consult their parents in everything and listen to their instructions. Conversely, under "authoritarian love," for fear of excessive interference and complete control by their parents, they dare not raise problems in front of their parents when they encounter them, either suffering in silence or acting arbitrarily and going astray.</p>
<p>Children do not only belong to their parents and family, but also belong to themselves and society. Parents should abandon their own selfish intentions towards their children and put their children's interests first in everything, always thinking about the welfare of society. Only in this way is it true kindness.</p>

<h3>The Issue of Women's Political Participation in the Future</h3>
<p>— Yang Tongfang</p>
<p>In today's surging tide of democracy, many people are talking about the issue of women's political participation, believing that the highest ideal of gender equality can only be realized when women obtain the right to participate in politics. If women want to be liberated from their subordinate status and strive for independence and liberation of their personality, there are at least four requirements: First, to demand political freedom and equality. Second, to demand legal freedom and equality. Third, to demand occupational freedom and equality. Fourth, to demand educational freedom and equality. These demands can only be fully met when women obtain the right to participate in politics.</p>
<p>The so-called issue of women's suffrage is not just the ordinary struggle for the right to vote, because the struggle for the right to vote is only one-sided. True women's political participation requires the realization of complete civil rights, including the right to vote, the right to be elected, the right to form political associations, the right to freedom of speech and thought, and the right to be appointed as officials in administrative, judicial, and all public institutions, the right to education, and the right to financial management and inheritance. When demanding these rights, all conditions must be equal to those of men.</p>
<p>Since women acquire the right to vote as citizens, they can determine the fate of legislators and use political power to correct the historically unreasonable laws that favor male power. If women do not enter the political arena, no matter how loudly you shout the slogan of gender equality, it will be in vain. Today, enlightened politicians in various countries already believe that women's political participation can transform politics. Even the most stubborn rulers will feel the trend of democracy and only let women step into the door of politics step by step. The United States, New Zealand, and Finland, which were the first to implement women's political participation, have shown the world the excellent results after women's political participation. After the industrial revolution, the family system was destroyed, and women were swept into the vortex of survival competition. Social and political changes have a direct impact on women. This has doomed the collapse of the old social system, and women's demand to exercise political power has become the trend of democracy. Indeed, the relationship between politics and women is extremely close. Politics is everyone's business, and managing everyone's business is politics. Since we recognize that women are also people and that they are endowed with all rights, we cannot deny the power they should exert in politics. Not allowing women to participate in politics is tantamount to overturning the slogan of gender equality. If women do not work hard to fight for the right to participate in politics, it is tantamount to ruining their own future happiness. Once women have the right to participate in politics, they can obtain fair legal treatment in terms of occupation, education, and marriage.</p>
<p>If women want to gain true suffrage, they must go through arduous struggles. In the past, countless women used their own blood and flesh to fight against the feudal forces of society and traditional ideas. In China, the "May Fourth" Movement, which mainly aimed to oppose imperialism and feudalism, broke through the etiquette of the patriarchal society of past dynasties and restored women's independent personality. They took women's political participation as the main backbone. From Beijing to Shanghai, Guangzhou, Hankou, and Changsha, they responded one after another, gathered a large group of women, and launched a great women's liberation movement. However, the efforts at that time did not enable women's status to be fully guaranteed. Most women were still struggling in the shackles of feudalism. It was not until the "May 30th" Massacre occurred that the women's rights movement monopolized by upper-class women entered a new stage of lower-class women's liberation. It can be seen that the power of the women's liberation movement has been slowly accumulated and has gradually expanded its influence. From then on, Chinese women have increased their own understanding of the nation and the country and have a deeper understanding of the corrupt forces that remain in the real society, which must be completely eradicated, and have strengthened their understanding and grasp of reality through practical work. By this time, the women's movement had been combined with the national liberation movement. Every woman has learned from historical lessons that the political participation movement has become the core of the entire women's liberation movement, and at the same time, they understand that only the complete liberation of the Chinese nation can achieve the final goal of political participation for the vast group of Chinese women!</p>
<p>The eight years of arduous resistance war in our country have further educated countless women and made them further understand the meaning of political participation. Now we have achieved the final victory, and the blood of the martyrs in the past eight years has not been shed in vain. The mission that women should bear in the future nation-building process is indeed very important. We do not want women to shout slogans in vain. We hope that the women of the great era can bear the obligations that they should fulfill to society. The highest goal of women's political participation is to enable women to participate in activities under a sound political organization, use the legitimate right to vote and be elected, and express their political opinions through the votes they cast. And show their political abilities through the activities they engage in after being elected. How can it be considered true political participation to simply obtain the same political power as men?</p>
<p>During the nation-building period, Chinese women must understand the importance of their own mission to the nation and the country, overcome all difficulties, and use political power to overthrow unreasonable social relations and social traditions. Cultivate their own strength to participate in politics and combine knowledge, skills, and practice. Learn and hone in the vast society. When their intelligence develops, their physical strength is strong, their will is firm, and their experience is sufficient, they can quickly obtain the same freedom and rights as men!</p>

<h3>How to be a Stepmother</h3>
<p>— Baling</p>
<p>Being a stepmother is not an easy task. As the saying goes, "The sun in hot weather, the fist of a stepmother!" It can be seen that stepmothers are generally considered to be synonymous with ferocity in Chinese society.</p>
<p>However, as I see it, in our Chinese families, there are not necessarily no virtuous stepmothers; but because most women who are stepmothers rarely love the children born to their ex-wives, people generally do not talk about stepmothers; otherwise, they always believe that women who are stepmothers are not affectionate to the children born to their ex-wives, and even abuse them. This is indeed an unrealistic comment.</p>
<p>In order to correct the general public's view of underestimating stepmothers, it is necessary to discuss how to be a stepmother.</p>
<p>(1) More Rewards and Less Punishment: —Children are mostly active. Because they are active, they will often cause trouble. As a stepmother, you should use more rewards for children's mistakes to guide them to a correct path in an invisible way. Unless it is absolutely necessary, never punish them, because as a stepmother, even if you lightly punish the children, the neighbors will gossip endlessly.</p>
<p>(2) Lead by Example, Guide Children: —For example, children have bad habits such as getting up late, eating snacks, and not being clean. As a stepmother, in addition to guiding them with a kind attitude, you must also lead by example and guide children. Get up at a fixed time every day, don't eat snacks in front of children, keep your clothes clean, and make all the arrangements in the family beautiful and tidy by yourself. In this way, leading by example, children will definitely be influenced in an invisible way and follow suit by getting up early, not eating snacks, and being clean.</p>
<p>(3) Take the Opportunity to Mingle with Children—When spring arrives, "the spring is bright and beautiful" and "the birds sing and the flowers are fragrant," it is a good opportunity for a spring outing. As a stepmother, you can take advantage of the time and go out with them for a short trip and picnic when the children are on vacation, so that the children feel that the stepmother is lovely, not scary, so as to increase the relationship between mother and child.</p>
<p>In short, the position of a stepmother is strenuous and unrewarding. But if the stepmothers in ordinary families can treat their ex-wife's children as their own children and use the above three methods at any time, I believe that the social perception of stepmothers can definitely be changed.</p>

<h3>Warning to Celibates</h3>
<p>— Yang Yongzhang</p>
<p>Everyone has their own philosophy and outlook on life. Celibacy is the principle advocated by those who are unwilling to marry. Of course, they have economic, sociological, and other academic reasons and bases. I won't discuss these for now. Now, I will introduce some of the "value" of celibacy from a medical standpoint.</p>
<p>Celibates believe that not marrying can avoid all kinds of troubles, enjoy happiness, and be free from family burdens, but the reality is the opposite. According to recent statistics, the incidence of various diseases and mortality rates are much lower for married people than for unmarried people. In other words, the latter are more likely to get sick, and unfortunately, once they fall ill, they are also more likely to die.</p>
<p>What is the reason for this? The lifestyles of celibates (due to the lack of a family) are mostly irregular, unlike married people who have the assistance of their wives. Therefore, they are careless about their diet and are prone to gastrointestinal diseases (such as chronic gastritis, typhoid fever, cholera, etc.); they also pay little attention to their clothing and are prone to colds and influenza. As a result, celibates are more likely to suffer from anemia and tuberculosis due to malnutrition and lifestyle imbalances. Moreover, many celibates are either frustrated or self-satisfied people, and of course, they like to smoke, eat excessively, and gamble, which more or less affects their health both physically and mentally.</p>
<p>Celibates, listen to my warning!</p>

<p>The women's issue is closely related to the entire social issue. How can the women's issue be resolved today when everything is not yet on track? This is an undeniable fact. However, in terms of subjective aspects, we dare not underestimate ourselves, but we are also unwilling to exaggerate, like the common saying "caused by the environment, inevitable in the process," such a statement can easily push away one's own responsibility, and saying too much is very dangerous. We should frankly, bravely, critically expose our weaknesses, shout fewer slogans, and engage in more self-improvement.</p>
<p>Today, the solution to the women's issue mainly lies in how to enrich oneself and unite oneself, and then attack the objective obstacles. There should be mutual competition within the women's circle itself. If she is better than me, I should be even better than her, but this should not be adversarial. I am not afraid that she is better than me. If she is good, I want her to be even better. If I am better than her, I must pull her up and make her better with me. More importantly, within the women's world, there is no need to divide into factions, because we ourselves are pitiful enough. We can't even handle our own affairs well! What we need is unity and enrichment. In the future, we must pay attention to the following practical issues:</p>
<p>(1) Establish correct marital values.</p>
<p>(2) Pay attention to physical health.</p>
<p>(3) Petition the government to establish more nurseries.</p>
<p>(4) Petition the government to establish more municipal girls' middle schools and national women's universities, or increase the number of female students in municipal girls' middle schools and national women's universities.</p>
<p>(5) Those who have already joined the workforce should strive for progress.</p>

<h3>A Woman's Story</h3>
<p>— Zhang Wanqing</p>
<p>Women seem to be forever immersed in a fountain of sorrow. Because of this, it is felt that women are miserable. When a woman is born, the midwife says, "It's a daughter." The mother frowns first. If there's a grandmother? She will definitely say, "A money-losing product!" Even if there are many brothers, raising one is like raising them all. As long as it's a boy, the whole family looks at him with joy. "Girls' urine smells fishy," I often heard my nanny say when I was little. Braiding two small braids and wearing a flowered dress, "This girl is annoying, she has to braid her hair! If she doesn't braid it, she looks like a boy, which is too much trouble? Boys are easier. Boys don't know how to be picky, but this little girl wants to wear it when she sees someone wearing a flowered dress!"</p>
<p>Girls are naturally imitative from an early age: they love to cry, love to compete for grades, have poor memory, and are petty. They often argue until their faces are red, but after a while, they are fine again. They are coquettish, lazy, and love to take the car when they go out. They apply for financial aid, but then tell their classmates, "My mom bought me a pair of leather shoes yesterday, worth tens of thousands." When filling out the application form, they write, "My family is poor, and my father's income is limited. If it weren't for the financial aid, I simply wouldn't have the opportunity to study." It's written so miserably, it makes people cry, but it's not like that at all. It's fake! They love to lie, and eight out of ten sentences are fabricated. If they hide it well, no one can tell; if they don't hide it well, they are exposed and then try to argue. They love to talk a lot, love to ask questions, and love to eat snacks, "This smoked chicken is for Dad to have with his wine. Don't watch from the side when Dad is drinking!" When Dad comes and drinks, they insist on watching from the side. Dad can't stand it and tears off a chicken leg. As he chews, Mom comes and says, "You just ate, and now you're eating chicken? Haven't I told you? Don't wander around the table! You glutton! You're not comfortable if you don't eat!" Dad might laugh, "Girls are all gluttons! You were the same when you were little! I gave it to her! I can't eat it all!" The situation is resolved, with tears in her eyes, she can't bear to throw away the chicken leg and keeps chewing it until she reaches the bone, then throws it on the ground, looks at Dad, looks at Mom, and silently slips out.</p>
<p>She's also grown quite pretty, just as mischievous as boys; playing soccer, she wears out a pair of shoes a month and still needs to have them resoled. Her chest is gradually rising, she knows how to be shy, her stomach hurts, she can't eat cold things, she sleeps in bed, how boring, how troublesome, boys aren't like this.</p>
<p>From her mother's hand, she is passed into someone else's hand, that of a young, handsome man of a similar age: going to the movies becomes a regular thing, she doesn't want to go to school; following the rhythm of the music, she spins and spins, from the dance floor to the auditorium; from applause, laughter, and praise, she enters another world: everything is new, there are fewer people, it's quiet, slowly, she learns to cook, learns to manage the household, learns to gossip, learns to be stingy, learns to show off, learns to slowly pull the zipper of her wallet when hosting guests, learns to watch the man's rickshaw, learns to argue with the man.</p>
<p>At first, they still make concessions, but gradually, he doesn't come back, tears and snot are useless, how long will it take to endure? Mom can't help, and Dad can't say anything excessive, so she waits, hoping that he will return one day! One or two years pass, and another family is formed, both sides are the same, both are women, both have children, both sides live. Women are fragile! They can't live without a man's support! Women give birth to women, women never stop giving birth to "people."</p>
<p>Women always live like this! Women should rely on men, eat ready-made meals, endure scolding, endure ridicule, endure bullying, endure being kicked out, generation after generation.</p>
<p>Women are not good at being independent, don't want to be independent, are unwilling to be independent, and cannot be independent. Because of this, women will always live under the thumb of men: they will be beaten, they will be bullied, they will be concubines, they will be prostitutes, they will be played with by men, they will flatter men, they will listen to men's commands, and they will be controlled by men. Women seem to have endless stories to tell, these stories have been passed down from great-great-grandmothers! Women must submit, must endure, must "cry to heaven"; endurance is a woman's duty, endurance is a woman's specialty, even if a knife is stabbed in the heart, "endure"!</p>
<p>One day, endurance will turn things around, those who are not good at being independent will become independent, those who don't want to be independent will become independent, those who are unwilling to be independent will become independent, those who cannot be independent will become independent! Knowledge first, skills second, work third, hardship fourth. Don't envy others, don't flatter others, enrich your knowledge, maintain your health, develop your skills, and work hard. Roll up your sleeves and go to the kitchen; pick up your pen and go to society; women no longer cry, no longer compete for grades, are no longer petty, are no longer coquettish, are no longer lazy, don't take the car much when they go out, don't lie, don't eat snacks, don't gossip, aren't stingy, don't show off, don't slowly pull the zipper of their wallets, don't watch the man's rickshaw, don't argue with men, don't rely on men's support, don't eat ready-made meals. Don't let people beat you, don't let people scold you, don't let people ridicule you, don't let people bully you, and don't let people kick you out; women should enrich their own strength, women are no longer immersed in the fountain of sorrow, women are people, women will never be sad again!</p>
<p>Children</p>
<h3>Don't Teach Children to Make Mistakes</h3>
<p>— Shang Weicheng</p>
<p>When parents see their children making mistakes, almost all of them are extremely angry, followed by a beating and a stern reprimand. After scolding and beating, they consider it over. They all believe that this mistake happened by chance. If they commit it again? Then they beat and scold again. If they still keep making the same mistake? Then, the children's parents are disappointed and heartbroken: they say that this child is inherently bad, not ambitious, and even sigh and say:: I don't know what sins I committed in my previous life to raise such an unfilial child!</p>
<p>I dare not believe that children are born to make mistakes, but I do believe that there is such a thing as parents committing sins, and I think it is "deeply ingrained." Why not "three points"? Because these parents are still making some mistakes: this sin was not committed in a previous life, but after the child was born, in this life.</p>
<p>What sins have they committed? To say it is sure to make parents sad, it is the sin of teaching children, directly or indirectly, oneself—or someone else while oneself did not stop them—the methods of committing the mistakes they are committing today!</p>
<p>Take lying as an example. Sometimes lying is because objective conditions force them to do so, but sometimes they have a hard time if they don't lie. If the former is equivalent to the second stage of lung disease, then the latter is the incurable third stage. What is the first stage? It is the stage of being taught. Of course, I am not saying that parents will teach their children to be bad, to be vile, to lie! But I believe that facts similar to the following do exist in every family: a child, sometimes does not want to call you, or say that another person is not good, at this time, for the sake of temporary self-satisfaction, fun, holding a piece of candy in your hand, you say to the child: "You call me Niangniang, and I will give you the candy to eat," or "You scold him as a little devil, and I will like you." If the child calls you Niangniang or scolds the little devil, the reward is immediately given, the candy is taken out, or a kiss is given. Innocent children, their desires are nothing more than eating and receiving the caress of elders, and desires are unlimited. When they see something that can satisfy their desires, they instinctively want to get it. When they know that the exchange condition is to call you Niangniang or scold a little devil, even if they don't want to do so, they have to do it. Once they do this, they have completely read the first chapter of "Lying Studies"! From this, it is unconsciously imprinted in their hearts: lying is a means of satisfying desires. Once they cannot achieve a certain goal, they will unconsciously lie again as a means! Once they get used to lying, it becomes a "disease," even when there is no need to lie, even when they don't want to, they are still lying. This begins in childhood, begins in infancy!</p>
<p>Lying is like this, other mistakes are also like this!</p>
<p>For the sake of temporary interest, you will make yourself eternally troubled, and you will also harm the child for life, if you don't correct it early!</p>
<p>However, if the child has already made a mistake (of course, those who have not taught the child should not teach them again, and those who have taught them should stop immediately), then is the way to correct it to rely on beating and scolding to make him (her) not commit crimes again? Ordinary people think that it is definitely possible, because the child will know that committing this mistake will suffer physical and mental pain. But the fact is not so. The child will still commit it again. Why? We all know that when parents beat their children, while beating them, they always say: "You say! Will you do (say) it again next time? Say it! If you say "no," I won't beat you!" Escaping all pain is the instinct of all living things. At this time, the child has no room to resist, nor the ability to resist! It is not easy for him to listen to his parents' blame, but when he hears "If you say 'no,' I won't beat you," he gets hope, he gets a shortcut to escape the current pain, just say "no"! The child says it, the parents no longer beat him, and they think that the child has repented. In fact, the child has not thought about "no more next time" at all, what he knows is the relationship between saying "no" and "I won't beat you," which is exactly the same as the relationship between "call me Niangniang" and "I will give you the candy to eat"! Therefore, the child will not only not stop making mistakes, but he will also learn that when he commits a mistake and is punished by his parents, he can just say "no more next time" and everything will be fine! Those who can lie will lie even more, and those who can't say it and don't understand this way will be enlightened here.</p>
<p>Using beating and scolding as a means of correcting children's mistakes is not only insufficient to accomplish anything, it is simply more than a failure! Hauptmann said: "The feeling of repentance, to be expressed in words, cannot be seduced by saying some good words, nor can it be threatened by resorting to severe punishments." Of course, applying criminal law is still not okay! We can only use various methods to help children make them understand that difficult things cannot necessarily be solved by the form of mistakes they commit, tell them that it is better to solve them with other legitimate methods? Make them understand the bad reasons and locations for committing mistakes. Only in this way can we gradually reduce the child's mistakes.</p>
<p>Parents of children, please be careful with your children!</p>
