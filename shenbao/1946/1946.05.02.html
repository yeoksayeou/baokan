<h3>馬歇爾離渝前夕提議　共軍應先退出長春　現正等待延安答覆中</h3>
<p>〔本報南京一日電〕馬歇爾特使抵京後，一日首次訪何總司令應欽，陳誠部長及馬市長，面答昨日親臨機塲歡候之謝忱。馬使於二日上午曾親至美大使館及美軍總部視察，馬使二次來京後，對於中國首都市政在此短暫期間之進步，亦有相當之好評。當其聞及我在京軍政機關目前厲行夏令衛生運動，採取殺虫滅菌之舉措，似表快慰。聞馬使擬俟蔣主席凱旋，談判重開後，舉行記者招待會。</p>
<p>〔本報南京一日電〕政協會中共代表團工作人員，一部已到京，聞中共代表周恩來夫婦，定二日來京。</p>

<p>〔中央社西安一日電〕記者一日訪蔣主席西安行轅發言人，問：外傳關於東北問題各節，其內容究竟如何，當承述吿稱：外間所傳皆非事實，馬歇爾將軍此次到渝，繼續對東北問題努力調解，中央方面一本謀取國內和平之初衷，彼此無不開誠商討，其間關於中國之主權與條約，法理·紀律以及其所訂各項協定關係檢討，分析尤為詳盡，最後據余（發言人自稱）所知，迄至廿九日即馬歇爾將軍離渝之前夕，其對中共所提出之意見為：「此時應先將長春共軍撤退，交還中央軍隊接防，以後再談其他問題」，但中共當時並未接受其提議，僅答覆其將向延安請示。故中央旣未接獲任何正式提議，亦無從拒絕任何提議。至於聯合社所稱蔣主席已拒絕中共所提之要求一節，關無根據，總之，現在東北問題，只待延安中共對馬歇爾將軍「交還長春應歸中央接防再談其他問題」之提議如何答　而已。</p>

<p>東北現有日人約計一百三十萬，其中已有數千人被送集合葫蘆島，於四月二十九日登船返日。遣送東北日人工作最為困難，但預定九月底亦將完成。</p>

<h3>張嘉璈在滬接見記者　談東北當前情勢　今後應促成四國友好關係</h3>
<p>〔中央社本市訊〕東北行營經濟委員會主任委員張嘉璈，廿九日自渝抵滬，昨午後四時記者於細雨迷濛中特趨張氏寓所晋謁，叩詢東北當前一般情勢，張氏稱：接收東北自上年十月以還，中央政府即本中蘇友好協定與蘇聯交涉，希望按期撤兵，同時並督飭各省市行政長官，迅速接收各地政權。撤兵問題，中間雖幾經波折，現蘇聯軍隊已自上月中旬自長春開始撤退，定於上月三十日撤出國境，至是否已於三十日完全撤出國境以外，因最近電訊阻滯，尙未接獲詳細報吿。至接收東北各省市政權，因東北各地有當地武力及中共軍隊之存在，因此又生波折，竟至發生衝突，仍盼對於接防問題，早日圓滿解決，自可順利接收，其他一切問題，亦不難和平解決。張氏繼稱：東北問題，內而關係國家統一，外而影響世界和平，希望人人以民族利益爲重，使東北十四年在水深火熱中之民衆，得早日解除痛苦，而促進國家統一。此外，張氏又述及中蘇友好關係之重要性，非僅東北撤兵一端即認爲完全解決。今後爲謀中國之安定及世界之和平，必須努力促成中·美·英·蘇之友好關係。</p>
<p>〔聯合社北平一日電〕東北局勢消息頗形混亂，據新聲報瀋陽電，國軍於廿九日已佔領四平街四分之三，卅日晨即將其完全佔領，惟此訊尙未經官方證實。新華日報電則稱，自四月十八至二十八，雙方激戰十日，中央軍七師，由鄭洞國，梁華盛指揮，迭次進攻，均被擊退，戰事現已停頓。又據新華日報廿七日東北來電，中央飛機八架廿七日上午十時曾轟炸瀋陽東二百公里之敦化，人民死傷頗多。世界日報載空軍駐平代表之聲明，則究全否認此事，謂空軍祗任運輸，從未參加戰事，政府亦未下令命其參戰，否則中央軍可以前進較速，迄今祇有運輸機數架曾飛往東北云。據中共消息，共軍已於二十八日完全接管哈爾濱，並未遇何抵抗。</p>
<p>〔法新聞社瀋陽廿九日電〕（遲到）中共方面否認利用日本砲手及技術人員說，又聞中共已將東北九省劃分爲四個軍事防禦區域，即以瀋陽爲中心，而分東南西北中五個防區。</p>

<p>社論</p>
<h3>舉國一致建設新四川</h3>
<p>國民政府昨日頒發還都命令，勉勵全國軍民，同心一德，朝乾夕惕，實現三民主義之使命。尤其値得我們注意的，這命令中特別指出：「四川古稱天府，尤爲國力之根源；重慶襟帶雙江，控馭南北，占戰略之形勝，故能安度艱危，獲致勝利。其對國家貢獻之偉大，自將永光史册，永不磨減。當茲還都伊邇，鍾陵在望，緬維南京收復之艱難，更覺巴蜀關係之重要。政府前於廿九年九月明定重慶爲陪都，近更以四川爲全國建設實騐區，應即採其體制，崇其名實，着由行政院督同各該省市政府，悉心規劃，種極進行，使全川永爲定國之重心，而樹全國建設之楷模。」</p>
<p>的確，這次抗戰之能得到最後勝利，固由於蔣主席的英明領導，以及全國軍民的一德一心，含辛茹苦，堅韌奮鬥，但誠如國府命令所云，假使沒有我國西部廣大的民衆，和豐沃的地力，那末爭取勝利，也將苦無所憑藉。四川支持了全民族的抗戰，如今抗戰勝利，對於戰後四川的建設，這責任固然落在政府身上，同時也落在全國人民身上。在戰時的艱危環境中，四川可以支持全民族的抗戰，則抗戰勝利，如何協力推動四川戰後的建設，全國人民均有其責任。由於四川的支持全民族抗戰，我們纔能不致淪為亡國之民，那末如何協力推進四川戰後的建設，實是每個中國人所不能推托的應盡天職。</p>
<p>講到四川戰後的建設，莫要於重慶的建設。重慶爲我國戰時首都，抗戰的司令憂。在過去八年悠長的歲月中，在廣大的倫陷區域及戰區與後方，重慶發出來的光，照明了各處的人心。政府對於重慶的建設，至為關注，明定爲陪都，以崇其體制。然而戰後新重慶的建設，決不能全靠政府之力。凡我全國民衆，不論戰時曾吾到過四川，受過川人的惠，均應盡其最大之努力，相與協助。這八年來，重慶曾遭遇敵寇猛烈的轟炸，死難軍民無算，損毀房屋無算。因爲他們的死，纔有我們的活；因爲他們房屋的損毁，纔保全了我們的廬舍。死難的固然不能復生，但我們應該在戰後的陪都，爲這些因抗戰而死難的同胞，建立隆重而壯麗的紀功碑坊，以彰忠烈而垂永遠。至於爲抗戰而損毀的公共房舍，若學校，若醫院，若敎堂，若寺宇，或爲名勝古跡之所關，或則謀大衆之福利，復興修建，政府固應補助，凡我民衆，亦應慷慨捐輸，共囊盛舉。特別是收復區的人民，戰時他們身處敵偽統治之下，深苦報國無路，則戰後如何協力四川的建設，陪都的建設，自屬更爲義不容辭。</p>
<p>至於四川戰後的建設，經緯萬端，或致力於交通系統之建立，或努力於生產事業之推進，此在政府，自有妥善之計劃。但就性質的久遠及意義的重大言，實莫甚於水利的開發。昔李冰治水都江，整個成都平原盡受其利，豐功偉業，歷千秋而猶爲人所稱頌。四川雖物產豐饒，然川民每有「靠天喫飯」之諺。設或天時不調，旱祓成災，則富饒之農產必將遭受嚴重的影響。四川一地，「靠天」之成份特濃，故如何調節水利，在四川之意義特長。今政府有開發三峽水利及大渡河水利計劃，三峽及大渡河水利的開發受惠者固不盡川人，但可以說對四川特別有利。將來三峽及大就醫河水利計劃完成，那時四川將成為民族經濟的核心。這不但為四川立下了不朽之業，也為整個民族建下了新的基礎。我們要報答四川對於抗戰的貢獻，對於民族的貢獻，應趕快將這水利計劃，付諸實施。他日萬噸海輪可直駛重慶，不但「蜀道難」這句古話將不復適用，且將因這兩大水利計劃的完成，使四川成爲民族的樂園，三民主義建設的模範，可與美國田納西河流域的南方，同在人類文明史上後先輝映。</p>

<h3>在滬美人犯罪案　地院第一件審理　商船水手犯傷害致人於死罪嫌　辯護人桂中樞律師請展期再審</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕根據一九四三年中美協定第六條規定，北浙江路上海地方法院於昨日首次審理一美人犯罪案件。緣有泊於虹口碼頭之美商船古利號水手宛達，於四月八日下午十一時，偕同船工頭珂尼，赴百老匯路永定路十二弄十一號妓院內尋歡未果，正欲另求他途時，適遇美海軍預備隊二等副管事史潑羅司及其同伴茂倫（美船喬弗侖梅耶號副管事），珂尼即問史潑羅司，是否認得龜奴却利，變方言語不合，即起衝突，珂尼後頸被戳一刀，仆地呼救，宛達即前往相助，史潑羅司執小刀，刺破宛達外衣，宛達遂怒出三寸利刃猛刺，致史傷及肺腑，忍痛奔出該弄，至百老匯路五七三號門首，見有軍車，即趨入躱避，宛達追至，又飽以老拳，返身逃逸。史爲美憲兵救去，卒以傷重，至次晨九時斃命。其後兇手宛達被捕，經地方法院檢察處偵訊，以其實犯刑法第二七七條第二項傷害致人於死罪嫌，依刑事訴訟法第二三〇條第一項之規定，提起公訴。昨日下午二時零五分，地院刑開庭開審，官命張巡官驥。潘巡官祝鵬帶被吿到案。宛達身穿黑色上裝，藍布西褲，脚登黃色皮鞋，態度沉靜，亦頗彬然有禮。孟法官問他年齡·籍實·職業，答稱：「廿二歲，美國人，水手。」問其犯案經過，一一招供不諱，惟謂彼之所以刺史潑羅司，乃因史先出小刀刺來，不得不起而自衛，目僅刺二刀，盡在後背，與起訴書所稱五刀不合。被吿律師桂中樞因即提出請求，謂根據民國廿一年上字八十八號法令，刑事案件之騐屍，須經檢察官及法院所派醫師騐明後，方認爲合法，故要求法院再騐。庭上即出示美醫所騐圖表，傳閱被吿。旋即傳茂倫。柯尼。史華克拉。司蘭摩。福萊斯脫·白脫·納克萊特等美籍證人，一一詳詢後，即宣稱：除柯尼與史華克拉二人需留滬候詢外，其餘證人可返美。史華克拉當庭陳述留滬困難，請求尤其歸國，孟法官謂院方體念彼之困難，准其離滬，然柯尼必須留華候詢。桂中樞律師以該案接辦過分侷促，搜集證據不便，故求展期，法官遂諭改期再訊，被吿還押</p>

<h3>又一個響喊「地下工作」的偽官　吳凱聲久受國恩甘心附逆　受審時喟嘆似有悔意　含淚晤家屬互道珍重</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕僞官吳凱聲，宜興人，四十七歲，住惇信路四十三號。曾任僞考試院考選委員會委員，僞駐意大利大使（未出國），僞外交部次長，僞撤廢治外法權委員會秘書長。勝利後，在軍統局供認不諱，而被吿在戰前曾任我國民政府外交部秘書及顧問，曁日內瓦中國國際聯合辦事處處長兼駐瑞士公使，久受國恩，乃竟甘心附逆，故解高檢處後，陸檢察官以其有犯懲治漢奸條例第二條第一項第一款之罪嫌，提起公訴。昨晨十時，由曹駿推事升高院臨時刑庭，首次開審。吳穿藍布長衫，白袖外捲，着黃色半舊皮鞋，戴白金無邊眼鏡。向庭上深深一鞠躬。據供，彼雖稱學法，實爲法國里昂大學政治經濟系畢業。民國廿一年自歐洲歸國後，即脫離政府，執行律師業務。滬戰發生，曾招待傷兵，及上海淪陷，受交通部駐滬辦事處處長郁秉堅之囑，在辣斐德路六一二號設置無綫電台與內地通電。後爲日軍巡邏汽軍所覺，被迫遷移。及眞茹失守，國際無綫電局被毁，乃設國際無綫電局於社美路九號，中央發往歐洲電訊，均由該處轉發，有蔣主席電訊原文一件爲證。該文藏於其母所供佛像座中，故不曾爲敵所見。吳乃喟然嘆曰：「如當時爲敵所覺，也不用再吃這種官司了！」至吳逆之參加僞府，據其供稱：「南京僞政權想利用人家做招牌，便像拉伕一樣拉去給掛了名。」所謂僞考試院考選委員會職，乃褚民誼未得彼之同意而發表者，任僞駐意太使如此，任僞外次亦如此。至於僞撤廢治外法權委員會秘書長事，則謂該會僅具虛名，實未成立。曹推事問在僞外次任內，曾否參預偽府對英美宣戰與簽訂「中」日同盟協定？吳答：「我那時住在南京武義路四號，旣不拿只够啃大餅的薪，也不去辦過公，完全掛名而已：」勝利後，因檢舉奸逆之風頗緊，乃投軍統局自首。被吿律師蔡曉白提出證件數紙，證明被吿與侍從室陳長風，軍統局程克祥，皆有聯絡，從事地下工作，並掩護中央要員，均有證據云云。曹推事以該案猶需詳査，乃諭改期再審。當被吿還押之先，要求與家屬談話，經法官准許，即與其妻等數人見面，互道珍重。吳逆含淚語家屬曰：「我不是漢奸，法官必能秉公處理」云。</p>

<h3>銀根抽緊多頭出籠　金鈔均告疲落　配給價改為一七四</h3>
<p>烚赤昨銳氣已挫，多方紛謀了結，續吿回落，晨開平盤，開後一度回挺至一八一萬景，惟爲時不久，銀根緊迫萬分，買氣銷沉，多頭遂起恐慌，逐漸盤低，十時後在一七五萬左右盤旋，金業向中行登記者爲數界大爲减少，僅二六五條，價以一七四萬配給，市上見此情景，知難而退，陣容瓦解，市價遂一再屈伏，再破一七〇萬大關，午刻在一六八萬光景徘徊，午後續疲，退居一六五萬左右，結果較前收續跌十一萬，飾金十七萬九，紋銀降爲一千七，銀元一千〇八有賣，暗拆晨初最緊，息價二角左右，迨後金市斬多，暗息亦微降至一角七。</p>
<p>外幣美鈔亦隨金價步降，過程平庸，晨開二四〇〇元，開後買戶稍有活動，最高價亦難越二五〇〇元大關，迨後金價洩氣，鈔市亦盤旋而下，午刻在二三五〇元左右掙扎，午後亦然，結果較前收續跌八十元，港票中途一度吿緊，籌碼不多，仍在港匯價以下掙扎，賣買價稍告拔開，結果較前收老貨平，新貨跌五元，港匯四百五六，求供均多，羅比五六〇元左右，英匯明暗均平。</p>
<h3>公債一致反漲華股繼續回跌</h3>
<p>公債連跌過多，昨稍反動，統丙晨開即升至六千元外，在六二〇〇元左右盤旋，一度步漲至六五〇〇元，但爲時至暫，高價仍遭壓制，近午復破入六千元關，見五九五〇元而後稍平，惟賣方聲勢尙股，結果較前收回升四百元，大戶求供不一，惟買方出發點，屬於搶一記帽子居多，以致大勢未見十分有利，雜牌甲乙丁祇好一百元，戊種漲一五〇元，華股繼續回落，過程則頗稱平靜，初時平穩，無如一般心理認爲證交最近旣盛傳積極恢復，仍側重冷熱套做，以致平時受人愛戴之五熱門，倍形寥落，開後不久，全盛時期，永紗爲五七五〇元，美亞四八五〇元，景福四八五元，新光四一五元，勤興三三〇元，後漸漸盤小，近午都以低價結束，冷門各股亦被帶小，惟不時有游資搜買，較熱門稍爲生色，較前收計五熱門各跌半成左右，冷門中型及元老各股亦帶小少許，小型則無甚榮辱，午後喊價平平，外股初疲後穩，游資稍有歸來，怡紗開後曾破一五〇〇〇元大關，外商銀行見賤有所吸收，證券帮游資亦有歸來，午刻局勢轉穩，內外行目標集中怡紗，以致其他各股以時間不及，難見起色，午收結果除怡紗較前收稍見回升外，其餘均吿續跌。</p>
<h3>紗價下瀉花交大暢</h3>
<p>昨日紗市直綫下降，緣金鈔風浪已轉趨平靜，銀根大見抽緊，是以紗價在此兩種不利消息之下，遂致一蹶不振，晨初一瀉十萬，　馬曾做一百十八萬，其餘各牌無不回跌，四二支跌勢尤勁，至收市時，雙馬回好至一百廿二萬，局勢爲之稍定，午時紡建照例開紗，自一支起至一百支止，各支俱備、獨缺市上行銷之廿吱及十六支粗紗，價較上期减低三萬至十萬，另有紗線十種，仍用投標方式招標，僅由同泰昌鑫泰兩家買去四種，餘未成交云。</p>
<p>昨日紐約美棉電訊報跌十至廿一磅音，計近期美金二七·六〇，遠期二七·七三，米特林現貨二八·二〇，本埠現棉市况受黃金與紗價猝落影響，亦轉平，惟交易更形發展，緣紡建公司觀望多日，突起採辦美種彭家坡及印度亞姆拉兩牌一千三五百包，無錫振泰進茄立拉二百包，此外同業交易五六百包云。</p>
<h3>絲綢減色</h3>
<p>昨日絲綢市價，一致下挫，一二〇號天橋人造絲一百六十二萬元開盤，下午最小喊過五十五萬元，結果仍做五十七萬元，較上日跌去十三萬元，其餘各號貨均小十萬至十五六萬之譜，廠經洋行貨八三分高勻度，略有交易，做開價二百六十萬元，其他各檔，俱短十餘萬元，綢貨昨市下跌甚鉅，美亞被面每百條小百分之十三左右，大誠格子壁縐開盤四千三百二元，四千一百五十元收盤，下午又挫，做三千八百八十元，較隔日短七百元之鉅。</p>
<h3>內地傳將禁止出口　米價昨又漲一千</h3>
<p>昨日米市因傳聞內地米糧行將封禁出口，是以人心堅挺，行情又升千元左右，惟白元則胃呆少神，陰元銷細，回小一二千元，麵粉汕頭甬帮均紛紛回出，步跌四五百元，油市以靑島來源湧吒，逐步下降，再小二三千元，黃豆市勢疲乏，生仁平定，紅糧苞米呆滯，麩皮供多於求，步削三四百元，豆餅疲中帶緊，略加百餘元，據米市塲息，昨日本市計到白粳等七種，共五千八百餘石云。</p>
<h3>本年首三個月　滬進出口統計</h3>
<p>中國銀行出口押滙　總額達五十六億元</p>
<p>據海關統計處負責人宣布，本年首三月之滬市進出口貨物數値如下，進口以百萬關金爲單位，出口以國幣百萬元爲單位。</p>
<p>進口　出口</p>
<p>一月　四六九·五·六四一·</p>
<p>二月　七五八·三·三〇八·</p>
<p>三月　二·二一〇·四·四六二·</p>
<p>中國銀行自本年二月至四月廿七日截止，該行所辦理外銷物資押滙款項，總額達五十六億三千九百廿六萬餘元，該項押款物資，計有生絲·黃狼皮·羊皮·豬鬃·桐油·腸衣·絲織品·皮貨·鵝毛·羽毛·茶葉等類，中以運往紐的者最多，英倫及其他各國較少，運銷香港者祗有花生·芝蔴·杏仁·黃豆·靑豆等食物云。</p>
<h3>煤市過程平穩</h3>
<p>煤市過程仍爲平穩，除烟煤開平二號屑有外埠去路外，餘均呆平，然開平二號屑浦東棧單，因受公會出貨憑單影響，市價略挫，蓋本市煤業公公前曾向經濟部上梅區燃料管理委員會申請配得烟煤五千噸，供五百餘家同業零售，內計開灤一號屑一千噸，價十五萬元，開灤火車塊一千噸，價十七萬元，開濼二號三千噸，已於上月底付款，分配竣事，同業可憑付款收據向公會領取出貨憑單，上一述出貨憑單票面多數均爲小額，且係浦東碼頭交貨，小同業爲出貨手續麻煩，故均於市塲拋售。</p>
<p>柴炭因產地米糧貴成本漲，致與滬地市價倒懸過巨，影響到貨，故市價亦稍帶緊，但實銷仍淸淡。</p>
<h3>食糖走銷呆滯</h3>
<p>昨糖市以實銷旣呆，人心頓疲，劃盤續見下游，上午中砂白初爲六萬六千五百元，旋至六萬六千元，更小至六萬四千五百元，下午又小五百元，爲六萬四千元，前後跌去三千元，號　開出刁靑一批，價爲五萬一元，亦小一一三千元。</p>
<p>普通元棗昨開出數十包，身份較軟，而色澤個子均遜，價爲三萬六千元，上檔元肉開出十餘箱，貨品尙佳，價爲十萬〇五千元</p>
<h3>茶價堅挺</h3>
<p>茶市因蘇州及天津等地之胃納益形良好，　貨者又有堅持之意，若干種花色，售價已吿抬頭，新龍井亦帶定，而最愛美國及印度孟買　愛之特買綠茶，亦呈見復活之象，昨市由午昌茶業公司吸進婺源貨四百箱左右，做開價每担三萬五千元，俟船期相近，即擬打包裝往南美洲云。</p>
<h3>金潮起伏之經過　中央銀行於三日內拋出烚赤三千餘條</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕據關係方面吿記者稱，本市前兩日金價異動，頗受路透社紐約廿八日一電之影響，該電傳美衆院貨幣委員會，有請提高美國金價之議，惟該方面痛斥本市投機家之斷章取義，蓋該電後段，曾剴切說明，美財部反對提高金似，故此議在衆院討論之機會極微，奈市塲不察，適中投機者之奸計，然中央銀行仍一本以往決策，隨市拋售黃金，廿九日曾以一百六十八萬之價格，售給金業公會七六六條，銀樓業一百條，其時市塲氣燄正盛，市况仍堅挺不已，中行乃更陸續向市塲拋售五百餘條，價格隨市略有上落，卅日市况趨勢仍堅，中行又以一百八十五萬之價格，繼續售給金業公會一一七〇條，銀樓二五〇條，而市况仍呈浮動，乃　　向市塲拋售四百餘條，售價自最高之一百九十二萬元以至一百七十六萬元，市勢卒吿不支，而中行仍拋售不已，昨日中行續有二百七十五條售給金業公會，價格爲一百七十四萬元，銀樓業則已無納胃，此外復陸續向市塲拋售八十餘條，拋售價格自一百七十一萬五千元以至一百七十萬元，故今日市勢已呈一面倒，終瀉至一百六十三萬元之低價，三日來因中行拋出金條達三千五百餘條之多，市塲游資已被大量吸收，暗息猛升，聞金融業中不乏有頭寸支絀者，中行因若輩不自檢點放款方針，徒使市塲游資增加，故暫時將不予以調劑頭寸之方便，俾若輩知所警惕，又前兩日金價異動時，向中行請結外匯頭襯者，亦突吿增加，經中行傻量供給後，昨日竟乏人請結外匯云。</p>
<p>又訊：外傳中央銀行將成立國際外匯審核委員會，記者曾詢該行，據吿並無所聞。</p>
<h3>東北大量猪鬃</h3>
<p>被蘇聯接收而去　鬃價恐將受打擊</p>
<p>頃由豬鬃業有資格之人士獲悉，國際豬鬃市塲之價格，最近將有遊轉之可能，其原因並非由於代用品之改良與發明，而爲大批特殊貨品之虞入市塲，此項貴品來源，頗爲曲折，蓋日人侵華之初，美國即不與同情，雖仍舊與汽油或錮鐵，但均限於現款交易，日人所有外匯，本極貧乏，乃搜括我國東北出口物資，以謀挹注，豬鬃一項，東北年產甚豐，日人多方搜集，太平洋戰起，尙有一部未及運出，銷英之路雖絕，但搜集仍有增無已，迨廣島原子彈一響，蘇聯乘虛而入，此項織物，亦隨而轉手，戰後蘇聯亦需大量進口物資，但無積存外匯，此項無本貨物，必以較廉價格傾入國際市塲，其數量之大，極爲驚人，據估計約二十餘萬關担之多，此種「黑貨」，近來已有發現云。</p>
<h3>英商銀行將提高黃金買</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦一日電〕據本社特派員訊：「英蘭銀行」現行每盎司一七二先令三辨士之黃金收買價格，或將略見提高，俾更接近於美國一七三先令八辨士之價。按自一九四五年起，英美間金價，始終持一先令五辦士之差額。</p>

<h3>活的賀禮</h3>
<p>— 歐麗</p>
<p>閩北一帶山區，出產杉木頗多。杉木生長很快，一二十年就有好幾丈高，就可以砍下來應用或出賣了。</p>
<p>據說在道些出杉木的地區，村民有一種特殊的習俗。每當村中有一家人家生嬰孩時，當嬰孩滿月或週歲的時候，親友們就集合起來，圈好一塊地皮，種好幼杉，以爲祝賀。等到道個孩子二十歲將要完婚的時候，親友們所送的那塊種着杉樹的地皮，已經樹木參天，成爲一片很値錢的杉林了。據說許多村民就靠着親友這樣的一片活的『賀禮」來成家立業的。</p>
<p>這種有建設性的賀禮，是比送送花籃或糖果餅乾有意義得多，也實惠得多了。</p>
<p>這種活的賀禮是値得我們效法的。</p>

<h3>「食」與兒童心理健康</h3>
<p>— 劉淪慈</p>
<p>兒童在衣·食·起居上時常有許多問題發生，需要父母們加以研究與處理。現在單就「食」的一項而言，就有不少的間題。譬如有的兒童一定要吃某些食物，而不要吃另一些食物，有的進食時必須要有人陪着他講故事，有的吃得很慢，有的他所用的坏盤食具不能更換，吾則便不肯進食。諸如此類，不一而足。父母們應該明白這些不良的習慣的發生，並非無因，也不是一朝一夕的事，要謀補救和治療，必須父母先對兒童心理加以硏究，而獲得澈底的瞭解，然後，找對付的辦法。</p>
<p>兒童們不肯進食的原因，除了是因爲他們身體上有什麼不舒服，或是他們在飯前已經飽食了糖菓零食，所以到了飯時不覺飢餓外，其餘多是心理上的作用。有些一向被父母溺愛慣了的兒童，甚麽事都需要父母來懇求他們，因此在吃飯時，也必須等父母勸食，而後纔肯吃，或是父母對兒童凡事有求必應，若有時要求不遂，那麼他們便發生了一種仇恨反抗的態度，而以拒絕進食爲要挾，他們的心理就是「你如果不依允我，我就不吃」。此外，還有許多因心理上的失調而引致兒童的不思進食或减少食量，如學校考試將臨時而發生的焦慮，預備參加宴會而致的興奮與渴望，以及因心愛的玩具遭損壞，學校考試的不及格，家人不睦等等所引起的惡劣的情緒。</p>
<p>應付兒童不肯進食的最愚笨的方法，莫如不去研究其原因而祇是一味勉强或是哄騙兒童進食。最好當兒童進食時，我們不要一刻不離的陪在旁邊照顧着他們，或是唯恐他們沒有吃飽而哄着他們說：「好孩子，再吃一筷吧！」有時你越是哄他們吃，他們越是不肯吃，反之，你置之不顧，他們倒會乖乖地吃了。當我們發現兒童的不肯進食是由於撒嬌，要挾等脾氣的發作，那麼任他不食好了，不必去懇求，哄騙他們。偶爾餓一二餐是不會影響到他們的健康的。反之，若是有一次經過你的懇求而進食，那麼便會使他們產生一種「唯我獨尊一的心理，往後每次進食，都非經過你的懇求不可了。此種不良的心理習慣一經養成，其爲害實較餓一二頓來得嚴重了。　嘔吐，也是一個與兒童進食有關的問題。嘔吐的原因大都是因爲在吃飯時，胃中吞蓄了許多氣體，或是所食過多。其屬於生理方面的，則大致是因爲他們患了先天性的幽門梗阻（Ccongenital　Pylorie　Stenosis），其胃部的幽門過於狹窄，以致食物經過幽門時，發生阻滯，道是需要外科手術割治的。　嘔吐的原因也有屬於病理與心理上的。但是我們怎樣去判別兒童的嘔吐是由於身體上有病還是由於心理失調呢？第一，是先從身體上作詳細的檢査，如兒童患了腦瘤（Braint　umor），腦膜炎（Meningitis），脊髓灰白質炎（Poliomyelitis），以及急性發熱症等等病症，在它將行發病的時期，其生理上所起的變化都可以引起嘔吐。至於由心理失調而致的嘔吐，其特徵就是他們的嘔吐時常來得特別容易，同時，他們雖然時常嘔吐，可是並不影響到他們的營養。如果發現嘔吐確是屬於病理的，那是需要用醫樂來治療的。如果是由於心理上的失調，那麽就必須對兒童所處的環境是否良好，生活是否合理，學校的功課是否過嚴，以及智力的高低與個性，情緒種種問題加以硏究，然後予以適當的處理。</p>
<p>總之，兒童「食」的問題，從開始餵乳時，就應該養成他們一種良好的習慣，質量合宜，按時給食，堅守勿渝。切不可因兒童啼哭而遷就，也不應過於溺愛而頻獻殷勤。玩要以後應給他們以充分的休息，然後去進食。飯前在兒童面前不宜爭吵，致引起他們的情緒緊張。父母對兒童習慣的訓練，應取一致的態度，在吃飯時，父母應該給他們一個良好的榜樣。飯前飯後禁止吃零食，遠離食物的引誘，和對於兒童的生活加以合宜的調劑，因爲有許多兒童愛吃零食，多由精神生活的單調及受食物的引誘所致，甚至有許多大人們一遇孩子吵鬧，啼哭，便以食物來止住他們，或是忙不迭的說：「去買糕糕」「去買糖糖」，這種錯誤的舉措與言詞，是亟需糾正的。</p>
<p>父母門果能做到上述諸點，那麼兒童便不至發生「食」的問題，即使發生也易於解決了。</p>

<h3>小圍裙</h3>
<p>— 蕭淑芳</p>
<p>這是一條適合於三四歲女孩用的小圍裙。現在的時令多半穿呢絨料，小孩很易弄髒衣裳。這條圍裙可以隨時繫着。假如做得好看，穿起來更增加整潔美觀。材料：二三尺左右素淺色布或有紅藍小花花布，紅藍布滾邊。</p>
<p>製法：依圖中尺寸剪裁，略爲放大，以備縫口，長短可視兒童大小斟酌。腰圍做夾層，兩端安置二耳，以備穿時將背帶交叉穿過繫一蝴蝶結，胸圍上端及圍裙下端並兩口袋配以不落色紅藍滾邊，夏天還可以作爲露背的小西裝穿呢！</p>
<h3>後母歌</h3>
<p>— 巴玲</p>
<p>「小白菜，地裏黃；三歲的兒童沒了娘！好好跟着爹爹過，就怕爹爹娶後娘。後娘娶了三年整，生個兒子比我强；他吃肉，我喝湯，啼啼哭哭想親娘。」</p>
<p>這是一首子女不滿意後母的歌謠。它充分的暴露一般後母歧視前妻子女的情形。這也是一個値得注意的家庭問題。</p>
<p>希望一般爲後母的婦女們，放大目光，要認淸子女是國家的，不是個人或家庭的，培養次一代的優秀國民，是自己的天職。能够抱着這種觀念，自然不會有虐待的事情發生了。</p>

<p>碩峯先生說：『妻子的心情，好比是家庭中的一只風雨表，和愛而愉快的妻子，不啻是一個晴朗的日子；假使她是乖戾的，那就像這種狂風暴雨的天氣了。」誠然，一個家庭中的幸福和煩惱，大半是憑在妻子的身上，一個心情善良的妻子，家庭必然是愉快的；反之，家庭雖不致破裂，但至少是得不到幸福和愉快的了。所以擇偶第一個秘訣，即是要考慮到她的「心情」。</p>
<p>其次因爲一個女子的心情，大都是由於她的母親的遺傳和所處的環境，兩者融洽而成的。假使母親是個「河柬獅吼」，平日對待丈夫毫沒有任何尊嚴的，那她的女兒平日受了她的渲染，將來也會同樣地對待她的丈夫了。假使母親是個能幹的主婦，平日在家裏克勤克儉，待丈夫如已，那她的女兒，將來也能像她的母親一般地勤勞而和霾了。所以除了你考慮她的心情而外，對於她母親的一切，也應得鄭重的思索才行。</p>
<p>外表的「美」當然是女性一大誘人的魔力，也可作爲擇偶的一個標準。不過許多靑年往往把它看做唯一的標準，那是錯誤的，因爲外表的美不久就會消失的。任你烏黑般的頭髮，也會變成斑白；任你頻果般的臉兒，也會變得衰老。所以外表的美，是時間性的美，時間性的美，過了相當的時間，這美就會給時間所淘汰的。</p>

<h3>Marshall Proposes Before Leaving Chongqing: Communist Troops Should First Withdraw from Changchun, Awaiting Yan'an's Reply</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Nanjing, 1st] Special Envoy Marshall, after arriving in Nanjing, paid his first visit to Commander-in-Chief He Yingqin, Minister Chen Cheng, and Mayor Ma on the 1st, expressing his gratitude for their warm welcome at the airport yesterday. On the morning of the 2nd, Marshall personally inspected the American Embassy and the American military headquarters. After his second visit to Nanjing, Marshall also expressed considerable praise for the progress of the capital's municipal administration in this short period. He seemed pleased to hear that our military and political organs in Nanjing are currently vigorously implementing summer sanitation campaigns, taking measures to kill insects and eliminate bacteria. It is said that Marshall intends to hold a press conference after Chairman Chiang's triumphant return and the resumption of negotiations.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Nanjing, 1st] Some staff members of the Chinese Communist Party's delegation to the Political Consultative Conference have arrived in Nanjing. It is said that Zhou Enlai and his wife are scheduled to arrive in Nanjing on the 2nd.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Nanjing, 1st] Young Party members and members of the Democratic League residing in Chongqing are scheduled to come to Nanjing on the 4th on two special planes.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Nanjing, 1st] Secretary-General Shao Lizi of the National Political Council is scheduled to fly to Nanjing on the 3rd, and Deputy Secretary-General Lei Zhen can arrive in Nanjing on the 2nd.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Hankou, 1st] Deputy Secretary-General Lei Zhen of the National Political Council flew from Chongqing to Hankou on the 1st.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xi'an, 1st] A reporter visited the spokesman of Chairman Chiang's Xi'an Headquarters on the 1st and asked: What exactly is the content of the widely circulated reports regarding the Northeast issue? The spokesman stated: The reports circulating outside are not factual. General Marshall's visit to Chongqing this time is to continue efforts to mediate the Northeast issue. The central government is acting in accordance with its original intention of seeking domestic peace, and both sides are discussing matters frankly and sincerely. The examination and analysis of China's sovereignty and treaties, legal principles, discipline, and various agreements are particularly detailed. Finally, according to what I (the spokesman refers to himself) know, up until the evening of the 29th, the eve of General Marshall's departure from Chongqing, his suggestion to the Chinese Communist Party was: "At this time, the Communist troops in Changchun should first withdraw and hand over the defense to the Central Army, and then discuss other issues." However, the Chinese Communist Party did not accept his proposal at that time and only replied that it would ask Yan'an for instructions. Therefore, since the central government has not received any formal proposal, it cannot reject any proposal. As for the United Press's claim that Chairman Chiang has rejected the demands made by the Chinese Communist Party, there is no basis for this. In short, the current Northeast issue is only awaiting the reply from the Chinese Communist Party in Yan'an regarding General Marshall's proposal of "handing over Changchun for the Central Army to take over defense before discussing other issues."</p>
<h3>Communist Troops in Shandong Widely Invade, Railway Repair Work Cannot Be Restored</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Jinan, 1st] The railway repair projects on all lines in Shandong Province have been completely suspended for ten days, and there is no sign of resumption of construction. Several cities besieged by the Communist troops have remained unresolved for months. Recently, the Communist troops in various places have launched widespread offensives again. In view of the seriousness of these problems, the Jinan Executive Headquarters will conduct active mediation. It is reported that the mediation policy of the newly appointed American representative of the group, Colonel Hawes, does not intend to go to various places for inspection but focuses on thoroughly solving fundamental issues.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Jinan, 1st] The situation in which the Communist troops in Shandong Province have been mobilizing their main forces for days to attack the National Army in Liaocheng, Yanzhou, Gaomi, Weixian, Zhangling, and other places is constantly emerging. This kind of ordinary offensive deployment is a planned action and is deliberately tearing up the ceasefire agreement. The general public, facing this increasingly tense situation in Shandong, is very anxious and deeply hopes that the newly appointed representative of the Executive Headquarters will have a brilliant plan to quickly quell the current crisis.</p>
<h3>Agreement Reached on Repair of Xinxiang-Linmingguan Section of Pinghan Railway</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Beiping, 30th] An agreement has been reached by the three section chiefs of the Railway Management Section of the Executive Headquarters regarding the repair of the Xinxiang-Linmingguan section of the Pinghan Railway, and an order has been sent to the Anyang 19th Group to implement the agreement. The principles are as follows: (1) Labor issues: The Ministry of Communications and local representatives (referring to the Communist side) shall employ workers on the principle of local employment. Skilled workers should also be employed from local residents as much as possible. As for technical personnel, if local technical personnel are qualified, they should be employed. (2) Issues of leveling and dismantling fortifications: According to Order No. 4 of the "Peace" series, the group should inspect and determine any military projects on and along the transportation line that obstruct transportation and order their removal or leveling. This work should be carried out simultaneously with the railway repair work.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Beiping, 1st] Not only has railway repair in North China been suspended, but it has also been repeatedly sabotaged.

<h3>Military Mediation Department Plane Crashes Near Beiping</h3>
<p>Twelve Members of the Executive Group Injured</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Beiping, 1st] The Military Mediation Department had an unfortunate incident while attempting to relieve the besieged city of Yongnian. The plane carrying personnel from the 31st Group to Anyang crashed in the suburbs of Beiping, injuring ten people. The Executive Department resolved three items a few days ago. In addition to mutually transferring the commanders of the two armies in Yongnian and organizing a relief committee, it also dispatched another group to mediate. The government and American representatives of this group took off in an American C46 transport plane at 9:35 this morning. Just eight miles west of Beiping, one of the plane's engines failed. The pilot used skillful techniques to land on the fuselage, avoiding a catastrophic crash. Fortunately, the gasoline and supplies carried by the group did not catch fire.

Government group leader Colonel Du Qiong, telegraph operators Lu Guming and Zhu Shengshu, American translator Li Xingya, and Executive Department communicator Su Bolaoski were all seriously injured.

The Executive Department has dispatched another representative to go, and they can leave in the next few days.</p>

<h3>Traitor Chen Bijun Applies for Retrial, Her Daughter Wang Wenxun Submits Application to Suzhou High Court Yesterday, Second Batch of Major Traitors in Beiping Transferred to Hebei High Court</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Suzhou, 1st] It has been the ninth day since traitor Chen Bijun was sentenced to life imprisonment by the Suzhou High Court. At about 3 p.m. on the 1st, her daughter Wang Wenxun personally took the application for retrial to the High Court. The reporter happened to meet her. The daughter was wearing a light yellow raincoat and black galoshes, her face was sad, and she seemed to have deep worries. She gave the reporter a copy of the original application for review. The content was full of sophistry. She claimed that both traitor Wang and traitor Chen were determined to serve the Party as fuel and could not bear to see the people of the world suffer without complaint. She praised the "peace movement" as a movement of great benevolence and great courage. She listed two reasons and eight "virtuous deeds" of traitor Chen in benefiting the common people, hoping to reverse the verdict at the end. She also said: If traitor Chen is still found guilty on the day of the retrial, she is willing to go to jail on the same day to serve the sentence on behalf of her mother, so as to fulfill her filial piety. She appealed to the law enforcement authorities to uphold the righteousness of benevolence, sympathize with the love of crows feeding their young, and have mercy on her foolish sincerity, so as to fulfill her lifelong aspiration. The main points are recorded below: (1) After the establishment of the "peace government," the people in the occupied areas gradually recovered, the fighting spirit of the Japanese army was shaken, and the southward faction of the Japanese warlords rose, leading to the attack on Pearl Harbor. Finally, the United States and Japan declared war, and the offensive on the mainland eased, and the adverse current of the War of Resistance began to improve. (2) The troops called by the "peace government" were all trapped by the Japanese army and cut off from the rear. If they surrendered to the Japanese army or became bandits, it would not be a blessing for the country and the people. Calling for reorganization was actually to preserve strength, and they never confronted the central government. She then listed eight virtuous deeds of Chen Bijun: A. Rice in Guangzhou once rose to 120,000 pseudo-currency due to the Japanese army's own purchase. Later, it was suppressed to 40,000 to 50,000 pseudo-currency. B. Established the Guangzhou Refugee Children's Shelter, rescuing no less than several thousand refugee children. C. Established a work-study school in Guangzhou, with most of the funding borne by her. D. Established an infant nursery and a maternity hospital for poor women, housing infants and assisting maternity women. E. In the winter of the 32nd year of the Republic of China, launched a winter relief fundraising campaign, raising more than 6 million yuan, all of which was distributed to charitable organizations. F. In the 31st year of the Republic of China, when Hong Kong fell, the Japanese side had a plan to forcibly evacuate Hong Kong Chinese. After negotiations with the Japanese side, it was agreed that returning to their hometowns should be based on the principle of voluntary repatriation, and transportation, reception, and protection were provided along the way. G. In the 29th year, the Central Hospital was built in Nanjing, which is still praised by the citizens today. H. Strived to promote culture and cultural relics, and recovered the rare and valuable specimens of Far Eastern plants collected over the years by Sun Yat-sen University and the Botanical Research Institute in Guangzhou, which were about to be transported to Japan.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Nanjing, 1st] The Capital High Court has scheduled to hear the case of traitor Mei Siping at 9 a.m. on the 3rd. Special audience passes for the court have already begun to be distributed. 1,000 ordinary audience passes will be distributed on the 2nd.

After the ugly appearance of the traitors is filmed into a movie, it will be immediately sent to various places for screening. In addition, the court is actively investigating more than 140 cases of major and minor traitors such as Lin Baisheng and Li Shengwu and will file public prosecutions one after another.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Beiping, 1st] The military authorities have decided that the second batch of major traitors will be transferred to the Hebei High Court on the morning of the 2nd. The list includes Tao Shangming, the pseudo-chief of education, He Bingwen, the pseudo-mayor of Zhangjiakou, and a Liang from the pseudo-mayor of Yantai, totaling 60 traitors.</p>

<p>[US Information Office Local Report] At its peak, there were 65,000 American troops in China. This has now been reduced to 4,581, but within this month, 900 of these 4,000 plus will be further reduced. They will return home on the "Ante Marine" ship, which arrives in Shanghai on May 17, as they are the personnel qualified for repatriation in May. In June, there are 800 American officers and soldiers qualified for repatriation. On the other hand, the US has recruited 1,000 experts from within the country, but their arrival date in China has not yet been determined.</p>
<p>[Another Report] Colonel Wiedeman, director of the US Air Force Evacuation Group, said: The rumor that Japanese technicians in China will remain until June 15 is absolutely untrue. At the same time, they will definitely not be allowed to spend their pleasant lives in Shanxi Province.</p>

<h3>Zhang Jia'ao Meets with Reporters in Shanghai, Discusses the Current Situation in the Northeast, and Calls for the Promotion of Friendly Relations Between the Four Countries in the Future</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Local News] Zhang Jia'ao, director of the Economic Committee of the Northeast Headquarters, arrived in Shanghai on the 29th from Chongqing. Yesterday afternoon at 4:00, the reporter specially visited Zhang's residence in the drizzling rain to inquire about the general situation in the Northeast. Zhang said: Since the central government took over the Northeast in October last year, it has been negotiating with the Soviet Union in accordance with the Sino-Soviet Friendship Treaty, hoping to withdraw its troops on schedule and supervising the administrative officials of the provinces and cities to quickly take over the local political power. Although there have been several twists and turns in the troop withdrawal issue, the Soviet troops have begun to withdraw from Changchun in the middle of last month and are scheduled to withdraw from the country on the 30th of last month. As to whether they have completely withdrawn from the country by the 30th, detailed reports have not yet been received due to recent disruptions in communications. As for the takeover of the political power of the provinces and cities in the Northeast, because of the existence of local armed forces and Communist troops in various places in the Northeast, there have been twists and turns, and even conflicts have occurred. It is still hoped that a satisfactory solution to the defense issue can be reached as soon as possible so that a smooth takeover can be achieved. Other issues are also not difficult to resolve peacefully. Zhang continued: The Northeast issue is related to national unity internally and affects world peace externally. He hoped that everyone would put national interests first so that the people of the Northeast who have been in dire straits for 14 years can be relieved of their suffering as soon as possible and promote national unity. In addition, Zhang also mentioned the importance of Sino-Soviet friendly relations, not only the troop withdrawal from the Northeast is considered a complete solution. In the future, in order to seek China's stability and world peace, we must strive to promote friendly relations between China, the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>[United Press Beiping, 1st] News about the situation in the Northeast is quite chaotic. According to the Shenyang telegram of the New Voice Daily, the National Army occupied three-quarters of Sipingjie on the 29th and will completely occupy it on the morning of the 30th. However, this news has not been officially confirmed. According to a telegram from the New China Daily, from April 18 to 28, the two sides fought fiercely for ten days. The 7th Division of the Central Army, commanded by Zheng Dongguo and Liang Huasheng, repeatedly attacked but were repelled. The fighting has now stopped. According to a telegram from the Northeast on the 27th of the New China Daily, eight central airplanes bombed Dunhua, 200 kilometers east of Shenyang, on the morning of the 27th, causing many casualties among the people. A statement by the Air Force representative stationed in Beiping, published in the World Daily, completely denies this, saying that the Air Force is only responsible for transportation and has never participated in the war, and the government has not ordered it to participate in the war. Otherwise, the Central Army could have advanced faster. So far, only a few transport planes have flown to the Northeast. According to Communist news, the Communist troops completely took over Harbin on the 28th without encountering any resistance.</p>
<p>[French News Agency, Shenyang, 29th] (Delayed) The Communist side denies the claim of using Japanese gunners and technicians.

<p>[Dispatch from United Press, Changchun, 27th] (Incomplete) Five American reporters who have been detained in Changchun under the pretext of "residential protection" since April 16 have protested to Mao Zedong and requested that their respective news agencies and newspapers take formal steps to restore their freedom and return safely to Shenyang. They have repeatedly protested the Communist army's armed detention, but to no avail. Only once, under armed surveillance, were they given the opportunity to walk in the city. Two of the reporters' cameras were confiscated and not returned. The protest to Mao Zedong was forwarded by the Communist representative of the Beiping Executive Headquarters.

<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Jiangyin Office, 1st] Reports of Jingjiang's fall are inaccurate. On the 1st, transportation to Chengjiang was normal and security was consolidated. The towns of Jiasi and Huangqiao have been recovered.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Nanjing Office, 1st] Regarding Jingjiang, where information has been conflicting, what has been confirmed by officials yesterday is the town of Xinguang in Jingjiang County. However, this statement is not very reliable, as both Nanjing and Zhenjiang have conflicting accounts regarding whether the town is currently in the hands of the National Army or the Communist Army. People and the press in Jiangsu are extremely shocked and confused about the current situation in northern Jiangsu and the military news from Nantong, Haimen, and Jingjiang. They strongly hope that the military will no longer conceal the actions of the Communist army and will announce them at any time to dispel the doubts of the people. Furthermore, the National Army has new deployments at various ports in Jiangbei, which are sufficient to ensure the security of Tongyang. However, transportation between Jiangnan and Jiangbei will become increasingly difficult in the short term.</p>

<p>Encouraging Production and Increasing Cocoon Prices</p>
<p>Spring silkworms in this county have now begun to be raised. Farmers in the four townships are showing great interest due to the soaring price of silk cocoons. More than 80% have returned to their pre-war state, using it as an important sideline. This year's spring cocoon production is estimated to be 300,000 catties in the county.

<p>The Land Improvement Association was ordered last winter to purchase more than 7,000 shi of military grain from various landlords. Recently, due to the rampant anti-rent trend in the four townships, land rent has plummeted. The landlords have no money to purchase grain, so they specially requested and were approved to change the method, with the county directly purchasing grain from tenants, issuing certificates to offset rent payments.</p>
<p>Self-Defense Teams Investigate Yiguandao The "Yiguandao", which was very popular in various townships during the enemy and puppet period, has recently shown signs of resurgence, but the general intelligentsia is not swayed by it.

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The Entire Nation Unites to Build a New Sichuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the National Government issued an order to return to the capital, encouraging the military and civilians of the whole country to work together with one heart and one mind, day and night, to realize the mission of the Three Principles of the People. What is especially noteworthy is that the order specifically pointed out: "Sichuan has been known as the 'Land of Abundance' since ancient times and is the source of national power. Chongqing is located at the confluence of two rivers, controlling the north and south, and occupies a strategically advantageous position. Therefore, it was able to safely endure difficulties and achieve victory. Its great contribution to the nation will be forever recorded in history and will never be diminished. As we are about to return to the capital and Zhongshan Mausoleum is in sight, we realize the importance of the relationship between Sichuan and Chongqing after the difficult recovery of Nanjing. The government clearly designated Chongqing as the provisional capital in September of the 29th year [of the Republic], and recently designated Sichuan as a national construction experimental zone. Its system should be adopted and its name and reality should be respected. The Executive Yuan should supervise the relevant provincial and municipal governments to carefully plan and implement it, so that all of Sichuan will forever be the center of national stability and a model for national construction."</p>
<p>Indeed, the final victory of this war of resistance was due to the wise leadership of Chairman Chiang [Kai-shek], as well as the unity of the military and civilians of the whole country, who endured hardship and struggled tenaciously. However, as the national government's order stated, if there were no vast population and fertile land in western China, the struggle for victory would have been without a foundation. Sichuan supported the entire nation's war of resistance. Now that the war of resistance has been won, the responsibility for the post-war construction of Sichuan naturally falls on the government, but it also falls on the people of the whole country. In the difficult wartime environment, Sichuan could support the entire nation's war of resistance. How to jointly promote the post-war construction of Sichuan after the victory of the war of resistance is the responsibility of all Chinese people. Because Sichuan supported the entire nation's war of resistance, we were able to avoid becoming a subjugated people. Therefore, how to jointly promote the post-war construction of Sichuan is an unavoidable and obligatory duty for every Chinese person.</p>
<p>Speaking of the post-war construction of Sichuan, nothing is more important than the construction of Chongqing. Chongqing was the wartime capital and command center of China. In the long eight years, in the vast occupied areas, war zones, and rear areas, the light emanating from Chongqing illuminated the hearts of people everywhere. The government paid close attention to the construction of Chongqing, designating it as the provisional capital to honor its system. However, the construction of a new Chongqing after the war cannot rely solely on the government's strength. All Chinese people, whether they have been to Sichuan during the war and received the benefits of the Sichuan people, should do their best to assist. In the past eight years, Chongqing suffered fierce bombings by the enemy, countless soldiers and civilians died, and countless houses were destroyed. Because of their deaths, we live; because of the destruction of their houses, our homes were preserved. Those who died cannot be brought back to life, but we should build a grand and magnificent memorial archway in the post-war provisional capital for those compatriots who died in the war of resistance, to honor their loyalty and bravery forever. As for the public buildings damaged for the sake of the war of resistance, such as schools, hospitals, churches, and temples, which are related to famous scenic spots or for the welfare of the masses, the government should subsidize the reconstruction and repair, and all our people should generously donate to support this grand undertaking. In particular, the people in the recovered areas, who were under the rule of the enemy and puppets during the war and suffered deeply without a way to serve the country, will naturally have an even more unshirkable duty to cooperate in the construction of Sichuan and the construction of the provisional capital after the war.</p>
<p>As for the post-war construction of Sichuan, there are myriad details. Some focus on establishing a transportation system, while others strive to promote productive enterprises. The government naturally has appropriate plans for this. However, in terms of the long-term nature and great significance, nothing is more important than the development of water conservancy. In the past, Li Bing governed the Dujiangyan water system, and the entire Chengdu Plain benefited from it. His great achievements have been praised for thousands of years. Although Sichuan is rich in products, the people of Sichuan often have the saying of "relying on heaven for food." If the weather is unfavorable and droughts cause disasters, the rich agricultural production will inevitably suffer serious impact. In Sichuan, the "reliance on heaven" factor is particularly strong, so how to regulate water conservancy has a particularly long-term significance in Sichuan. Now the government has plans to develop the Three Gorges water conservancy project and the Dadu River water conservancy project. The beneficiaries of the development of the Three Gorges and Dadu River water conservancy projects are not only the people of Sichuan, but it can be said that it is particularly beneficial to Sichuan. In the future, when the Three Gorges and Dadu River water conservancy projects are completed, Sichuan will become the core of the national economy. This not only establishes an immortal cause for Sichuan, but also builds a new foundation for the entire nation. To repay Sichuan's contribution to the war of resistance and the nation, we should quickly put these water conservancy projects into practice. In the future, ten-thousand-ton ocean freighters can directly reach Chongqing. Not only will the ancient saying "The road to Shu [Sichuan] is difficult" no longer apply, but the completion of these two major water conservancy projects will make Sichuan a paradise for the nation and a model for the construction of the Three Principles of the People, which can shine in the history of human civilization alongside the southern United States in the Tennessee River Valley.</p>

<h3>Foreign Ministers Conference Discusses Italian-Yugoslavian Border Issues: Three Powers Oppose Soviet Demands; Decides to Have Representatives from Both Countries Present Their Views; Austria's Territorial Demands Rejected</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] London, 1st: Molotov and Byrnes clashed at the Four Foreign Ministers Conference over the issue of appointing an Allied Control Commission to implement the Italian treaty, and no final decision was reached. A second meeting was originally scheduled for tonight, but it was temporarily cancelled.</p>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 30th] The Four Foreign Ministers Conference today discussed the Italian-Yugoslavian border issue, examining four different proposed boundary lines. Molotov demanded that a large part of the Istrian Peninsula be ceded by Italy to Yugoslavia, which was opposed by the representatives of the United Kingdom, France, and the United States. According to sources from the conference, the United Kingdom, France, and the United States generally agreed, but the Soviet Union proposed moving the border further west. The Four Foreign Ministers Conference has now accepted Molotov's proposal to have two representatives each from Italy and Yugoslavia attend the meeting this Friday to present their views. It is reported that the United Kingdom, France, and the United States also advocate dividing the Istrian Peninsula based on a "line," with the port of Trieste remaining in Italian possession and most of the inland areas ceded to Yugoslavia. According to the three countries' plan, Trieste would become a free port under Italian sovereignty, providing access to the sea for Austria, Hungary, and other Central European countries.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 30th] Austria's request to the Foreign Ministers Conference to reclaim South Tyrol has been rejected by the Foreign Ministers Conference. However, if Austria only proposes small-scale boundary adjustments, the Foreign Ministers Conference may still consider it.</p>

<h3>First Labor Day After the War: Stalin Addresses the Soviet People, Saying He Is Loyal to the Policies of Peace and Security</h3>
<p>[United Press, London, 30th] In a broadcast to the Soviet people on the first Labor Day after the war, Premier Stalin guaranteed that the Soviet Union would always be loyal to its policies of peace and security, but he urged the Soviet people not to forget the international reactionary conspiracies that "hatch" new wars. Stalin also stated that all countries in the world do not want to see the scourge of war again, and we must always be vigilant and protect our armed forces and defense capabilities as if they were solid rings. All workers should complete and exceed the production targets set by the new Five-Year Plan. Only by continuously developing military science and military skills can the Soviet land, sea, and air forces shoulder the great responsibility of defending peace. During this war, the people realized that the fate of the country cannot be controlled by reactionary leaders. These people only know how to promote narrow, selfish, and anti-people goals. Countries that do not want to fall behind must take the fate of the country into their own hands, establish democratic systems, and actively fight against reactionary forces. The Soviet Union is willing to be at the forefront in the struggle for peace and security. The world has had the opportunity to recognize the strength of the Soviet Union and at the same time recognize the fairness of its policies, which are based on the recognition of the equality of all nations and respect for their freedom and independence.</p>

<h3>American Crime Case in Shanghai - First Trial in District Court - Merchant Marine Sailor Suspected of Injury Causing Death - Defense Attorney Gui Zhongshu Requests Adjournment for Further Trial</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] According to Article 6 of the 1943 Sino-American Agreement, the Shanghai District Court of Beizhejiang Road tried a criminal case for the first time yesterday. It turns out that Wenda, a sailor on the American merchant ship Cooley docked at the Hongkou Wharf, accompanied by ship foreman Kenny, went to the No. 11 brothel in Lane 12 of Yongding Road, Broadway Road, on April 8 at 11 p.m. When they failed to find pleasure and were about to seek other ways, they met Sproles, a second-class mate from the U.S. Naval Reserve, and his companion Mullen (mate on the U.S. ship Joffre Meyer). Kenny asked Sproles if he knew the pimp Cheli, but there was a dispute due to language differences. Kenny was stabbed in the back of the neck and fell to the ground crying for help. Wenda went to help, and Sproles stabbed Wenda's jacket with a small knife. Wenda became angry and stabbed fiercely with a three-inch sharp blade, causing Sproles to injure his lungs and internal organs. He endured the pain and ran out of the lane to the entrance of No. 573 Broadway Road, where he saw a military vehicle and rushed in to hide. Wenda chased after him and punched him severely before running away. Sproles was rescued by the American military police but died of his injuries at 9 a.m. the next morning. The murderer Wenda was arrested and interrogated by the District Court Prosecutor's Office. Based on the fact that he committed the crime of injury causing death under Article 277, Paragraph 2 of the Criminal Law, he was prosecuted in accordance with Article 230, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Procedure Law. The court opened for trial at 2:05 p.m. yesterday. Judge Zhang Ji and Patrol Officer Pan Zupeng brought the defendant to the court. Wenda was wearing a black top, blue cloth trousers, and yellow leather shoes. He was calm and polite. Judge Meng asked him about his age, origin, and occupation, and he replied, "Twenty-two years old, American, sailor." When asked about the crime, he confessed everything without hesitation, but said that he stabbed Sproles because Sproles stabbed him with a small knife first, so he had to defend himself. He only stabbed twice, all in the back, which does not match the five stabs mentioned in the indictment. The defendant's lawyer, Gui Zhongshu, immediately requested, stating that according to the decree No. 88 of the Republic of China, Year 21, the autopsy of a criminal case must be verified by the prosecutor and the doctor dispatched by the court before it can be considered legal, so he requested the court to re-examine the body. The court immediately presented the chart verified by the American doctor and circulated it to the defendant. Then Mullen, Kenny, Schwakla, Slanmo, Forrest, White, Naklete, and other American witnesses were summoned and questioned in detail. Then it was announced that, except for Kenny and Schwakla who needed to stay in Shanghai for further inquiry, the remaining witnesses could return to the United States. Schwakla stated in court that it was difficult to stay in Shanghai and requested to return to his country. Judge Meng said that the court understood his difficulties and allowed him to leave Shanghai, but Kenny must stay in China for inquiry. Lawyer Gui Zhongshu requested an adjournment because the case was handled too hastily and it was inconvenient to collect evidence. The judge ordered a change of date for further hearing, and the defendant was remanded in custody.</p>

<h3>RMB 1 Billion Loan to Grain Merchants Can Purchase Approximately 30,000 Shi of Rice</h3>
<p>[Reported by the Grain Administration Office] According to news from the Grain Administration Office: This RMB 1 billion loan to grain merchants is due to the order of receipt of funds and the distance of the purchasing locations.

<h3>Confiscated Property of Traitor Zhou Fohai Robbed - Case Solved in 35 Hours</h3>
<p>After a certain senior military organ was ordered to escort the former finance minister of the puppet regime, traitor Zhou Fohai, to Chongqing for detention, the soldiers Qiu Huizheng and others, who were recruited from the former puppet tax police general regiment, were sent to guard Zhou's residence at No. 262 Hufu Road in Shanghai, and Gui Songgen was stationed there for management. At about 8 p.m. on April 8, the soldiers, who were untamed, used guns to imprison the manager Gui Songgen in a small room, locking the door to prevent him from leaving. Then, they loaded two cars parked at the residence with ten bottles of foreign wine, Western suits, silk quilts, etc., and robbed them before fleeing. At midnight, Gui Songgen, who had been imprisoned, broke through the window and fled back to report the incident. The original military organ immediately dispatched detectives to search everywhere. After a day and night, clues were obtained that the two cars had driven out of Hunan Road that night and went to Huilan Township in Pudong, where the original purple-red car shells were repainted black in the middle of the night, looking as good as new, making it difficult to identify them as old items. On the second day (the 9th), the two cars were sold for 60 taels of gold. However, before the gold was in hand for even ten minutes, it was seized by the personnel of the original military organ along with the goods. In addition to the original car being recovered, the gold from the sale has also been seized. The case will be dealt with after the entire case is closed. In total, it took only 35 hours from the time the incident occurred to the time it was solved.</p>

<h3>Another Pseudo-Official Shouting "Underground Work": Wu Kaisheng Willingly Turned Traitor After Receiving Favors for a Long Time; Seemed to Regret During Trial; Met with Family Members in Tears to Say Goodbye</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Pseudo-official Wu Kaisheng, from Yixing, 47 years old, resident of 43 Dunxin Road, formerly served as a member of the Examination Committee of the Pseudo-Examination Yuan, Pseudo-Ambassador to Italy (did not go abroad), Pseudo-Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs, and Secretary-General of the Pseudo-Committee for the Abolition of Extraterritoriality. After the victory, he confessed everything to the Military Intelligence Bureau. The prosecutor stated that before the war, the defendant had served as a secretary and advisor to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of our National Government, as well as the director of the Chinese International United Office in Geneva and the Minister to Switzerland, and had received favors for a long time. Therefore, he willingly turned traitor. After being sent to the High Procuratorate, Prosecutor Lu filed a public lawsuit against him for violating Article 2, Paragraph 1, Item 1 of the Regulations on the Punishment of Traitors. Yesterday morning at 10:00 AM, Judge Cao Jun held the first trial in the temporary criminal court of the High Court. Wu wore a blue cloth long gown with white sleeves rolled up, worn old yellow leather shoes, and frameless white gold glasses. He bowed deeply to the court. According to his statement, although he claimed to have studied law, he actually graduated from the Department of Political Economy at the University of Lyon in France. After returning to China from Europe in 1932, he left the government and practiced law. After the outbreak of the Shanghai Battle, he entertained wounded soldiers. After the fall of Shanghai, at the request of Yu Bingjian, the director of the Ministry of Communications' office in Shanghai, he set up a radio station at 612 Route Lafayette to communicate with the mainland. Later, it was discovered by a Japanese military patrol car and forced to move. After the fall of Zhenru, the International Radio Bureau was destroyed, so he set up the International Radio Bureau at 9 Route Sayme. All telegrams sent by the Central Government to Europe were forwarded by that office. There was a telegram from Chairman Chiang as evidence. The document was hidden in the base of the Buddha statue provided by his mother, so it was not seen by the enemy. Wu sighed and said, "If it had been discovered by the enemy at that time, I wouldn't have to face this lawsuit!" As for Wu's participation in the pseudo-government, according to his statement, "The pseudo-Nanjing regime wanted to use people as a signboard, so they pulled people in like conscripts to give them a title." The position of the Examination Committee of the Pseudo-Examination Yuan was announced by Chu Minyi without his consent, as was the position of Pseudo-Ambassador to Italy and Pseudo-Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs. As for the position of Secretary-General of the Pseudo-Committee for the Abolition of Extraterritoriality, he said that the committee only existed in name and was never actually established. Judge Cao asked if he had participated in the pseudo-government's declaration of war on Britain and the United States or the signing of the "Sino"-Japanese alliance agreement during his tenure as Pseudo-Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs. Wu replied, "I lived at 4 Wuyi Road in Nanjing at that time. I didn't even receive enough salary to eat pancakes, and I didn't go to work at all. It was just a title." After the victory, because the trend of reporting traitors was very strong, he surrendered to the Military Intelligence Bureau. The defendant's lawyer, Cai Xiaobai, presented several documents to prove that the defendant had connections with Chen Changfeng of the Attendant's Office and Cheng Kexiang of the Military Intelligence Bureau, and was engaged in underground work and protected central officials, all of which were supported by evidence. Judge Cao stated that the case still needed detailed investigation and adjourned the trial to a later date. Before the defendant was returned to custody, he requested to speak with his family members. After the judge's permission, he met with his wife and several others and said goodbye. Wu tearfully said to his family, "I am not a traitor. The judge will definitely handle it fairly."</p>
<h3>Suspected Female Traitor Zhu Cai Carries Her Child to Court</h3>
<p>[Our Report] (1) French radio engineering expert Alaixi was accused of helping the Japanese search for spies from Britain, the Soviet Union, and Austria during the enemy occupation period. Yesterday morning at 10:00 AM, Judge Cao Jun held another trial. The defendant sophistically denied everything. Although Boge Laiski and others said they were harmed, they could not confirm that he had informed on them. Therefore, a detailed investigation is still needed, and the trial will be adjourned to a later date. (2) In the afternoon, the High Court interrogated a suspected female traitor case. The defendant, Zhu Cai, from Jiangbei, had assisted her husband, Zhu Bingrong, in serving as an intelligence officer for the enemy during the enemy occupation period, and had harmed our loyal patriots. Now, she was arrested after being sued by the family members of the victims. However, when the judge asked her questions, the defendant, holding a newborn baby she had recently given birth to in prison, cried and denied everything, saying that it was all her husband's fault. After being defended by her appointed lawyer, the court announced the end of the debate and scheduled the sentencing for May 4th. (3) Dong Xuelin, a patrol officer of the Pseudo-Police Bureau of Nanhui, and Wei Wenshou, a clerk of the Pseudo-County Government of Nanhui, extorted and defrauded illegally during their tenure in the pseudo-government. The prosecutor filed a lawsuit against them for violating Article 3, Paragraph 1, Item 1 of the Regulations on the Punishment of Traitors. The trial of the case will be concluded tomorrow, and the sentencing will be on May 4th.</p>

<p>Commercial News</p>
<h3>Tight Credit, Bulls Emerge: Gold and Currency Both Weaken; Allotment Price Revised to 1.74 Million</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the "sha chi" lost its vigor, and many were eager to close out positions, leading to a continued decline. It opened flat in the morning and briefly rallied to 1.81 million, but this was short-lived. Credit was extremely tight, buying interest was weak, and the bulls panicked, gradually pushing prices lower. After 10:00 AM, it hovered around 1.75 million. The number of gold businesses registering with the Central Bank significantly decreased to only 265 bars, and the price was allotted at 1.74 million. Seeing this situation, the market knew it was difficult to succeed and the ranks disintegrated. The market price repeatedly succumbed, breaking through the 1.7 million mark again. At noon, it lingered around 1.68 million, and the weakness continued in the afternoon, falling to around 1.65 million. As a result, it closed 110,000 lower than the previous close. Ornament gold was at 179,000, refined silver fell to 1,700, and silver dollars were sold at 1,008. The unofficial interest rate was tightest early in the morning, around two jiao, but as the gold market cut losses, the unofficial rate also slightly decreased to 1.7 jiao.</p>
<p>Foreign currency, specifically U.S. dollars, also decreased following the gold price, the process being mediocre. It opened at 2,400 yuan in the morning, and there was some activity from buyers after opening, but the highest price could not surpass the 2,500 yuan mark. Later, as the gold price weakened, the currency market also declined. At noon, it struggled around 2,350 yuan, and the afternoon was similar. As a result, it closed 80 yuan lower than the previous close. Hong Kong currency tightened at one point midway, with limited trading volume, and continued to struggle below the Hong Kong exchange rate. The buying and selling prices slightly widened. As a result, the old stock closed flat compared to the previous close, and the new stock fell by 5 yuan. The Hong Kong exchange rate was 456, with both supply and demand being high. Robi was around 560 yuan. Both the official and unofficial rates for British currency were flat.</p>
<h3>Public Bonds Rise Across the Board, Chinese Stocks Continue to Fall</h3>
<p>Public bonds, having fallen excessively, rebounded slightly yesterday. Unified Category C opened in the morning and immediately rose to over 6,000 yuan, hovering around 6,200 yuan. It briefly rose to 6,500 yuan, but only temporarily, as high prices were still suppressed. Near noon, it broke back below the 6,000 yuan mark, finding some stability at 5,950 yuan. However, the selling pressure remained strong. As a result, it closed 400 yuan higher than the previous close. Demand from large investors varied, but the starting point for buyers was mostly to grab a quick profit, so the overall trend was not very favorable. Miscellaneous brands of Categories A, B, and D were only at 100 yuan, and Category E rose by 150 yuan. Chinese stocks continued to fall, but the process was quite calm. Initially, they were stable, but generally, the psychology was that although there were recent rumors of active restoration of the stock exchange, the focus was still on speculative trading of hot and cold stocks. As a result, the five previously popular stocks were particularly deserted. Shortly after opening, at their peak, Yong Yarn was at 5,750 yuan, Mei Ya at 4,850 yuan, Jing Fu at 485 yuan, Xin Guang at 415 yuan, and Qin Xing at 330 yuan. Later, trading gradually diminished, and they all closed at lower prices near noon. Less popular stocks were also affected, but there were occasional speculative funds buying them, making them slightly more attractive than the popular stocks. Compared to the previous close, the five popular stocks each fell by about 5%, and mid-sized and veteran stocks among the less popular stocks also decreased slightly. Smaller stocks did not see much change. In the afternoon, asking prices were flat. Foreign stocks initially weakened but then stabilized, with some speculative funds returning. Yi Yarn broke through the 15,000 yuan mark after opening, and foreign banks absorbed some at the low price. Securities firms and speculative funds also returned. Near noon, the situation stabilized, and domestic and foreign targets focused on Yi Yarn, making it difficult for other stocks to recover due to lack of time. The afternoon closing result showed that Yi Yarn slightly increased compared to the previous close, while the rest continued to fall.</p>
<h3>Yarn Prices Decline, Cotton Transactions Flourish</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the yarn market declined directly because the gold and currency turmoil had calmed down, and credit had tightened significantly. Therefore, under these two unfavorable news, yarn prices took a sharp fall. Initially, it plummeted by 100,000, and the "Double Horse" brand once traded at 1.18 million. All other brands fell. The 42-count yarn saw the sharpest decline. By closing, the "Double Horse" brand recovered to 1.22 million, and the situation stabilized slightly. At noon, the Textile Construction Corporation opened sales as usual, from 1-count to 100-count, with each count available except for the 20-count and 16-count coarse yarns sold on the market. Prices were reduced by 30,000 to 100,000 compared to the previous period. There were also ten types of yarn and thread, which were still tendered. Only Tong Taichang and Xin Tai bought four types, and the rest were not sold.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the New York American cotton telegraph reported a decline of 10 to 21 points. The near-term was USD 27.60, the forward was USD 27.73, and the Midtling spot was USD 28.20. The local cotton market was affected by the sudden fall in gold and yarn prices, and it also turned flat. However, transactions further developed. The Textile Construction Corporation, after observing for many days, suddenly purchased 1,350 bales of American Pengjiapo and Indian Yamula brands. Wuxi Zhentai imported 200 bales of Cielitra. In addition, the trade conducted 5-600 bales.</p>
<h3>Silk Loses Color</h3>
<p>Yesterday, silk market prices declined across the board. 120 Tianqiao rayon opened at 1.62 million yuan, and the lowest price called in the afternoon was 550,000 yuan. It ended at 570,000 yuan, down 130,000 yuan from the previous day. Other grades of goods were generally down by 100,000 to 150,000 yuan. Factory-managed foreign firm goods with 83% high uniformity had some transactions, opening at 2.6 million yuan. Other grades were all down by more than 100,000 yuan. The silk goods market fell sharply yesterday. Mei Ya bedspreads fell by about 13% per hundred strips. Da Cheng plaid crepe opened at 4,320 yuan and closed at 4,150 yuan. It fell again in the afternoon, trading at 3,880 yuan, a significant drop of 700 yuan compared to the previous day.</p>
<h3>Rumors of Inland Ban on Exports: Rice Prices Rose Another 1,000 Yesterday</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the rice market was buoyed by rumors of an impending ban on rice exports from inland areas, and prices rose by about 1,000 yuan. However, "bai yuan" (white rice) was dull and lacked vigor, and "yin yuan" (shadow rice) saw reduced sales, decreasing by 1-2,000 yuan. Flour from Shantou and Ningbo were successively sold off, falling by 4-500 yuan. The oil market saw prices gradually decline due to the influx of Qingdao sources, decreasing by another 2-3,000 yuan. The soybean market was weak, raw peanuts were stable, red sorghum and corn were sluggish, bran supply exceeded demand, and prices decreased by 3-400 yuan. Soybean cake was weak but tight, slightly increasing by a hundred yuan or so. According to rice market news, a total of over 5,800 shi of seven types, including white japonica, arrived in the city yesterday.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Import and Export Statistics for the First Three Months of This Year</h3>
<p>Bank of China Export Secured Loans Total 5.6 Billion Yuan</p>
<p>According to an announcement by the person in charge of the Customs Statistics Department, the value of Shanghai's import and export goods for the first three months of this year is as follows, with imports in millions of customs gold units and exports in millions of national currency units:</p>
<p>Import   Export</p>
<p>January  469.5  641.</p>
<p>February 758.3  308.</p>
<p>March  2,210.4  462.</p>
<p>From February to April 27th of this year, the total amount of secured loans for export materials handled by the Bank of China reached over 5.63926 billion yuan. These secured loan materials included raw silk, yellow wolf skin, sheepskin, pig bristles, tung oil, sausage casings, silk fabrics, leather goods, goose feathers, feathers, tea, etc. The most were shipped to New York, followed by London and other countries. Only peanuts, sesame, almonds, soybeans, and green beans, etc., were shipped to Hong Kong.</p>
<h3>Coal Market Remains Stable</h3>
<p>The coal market process remains stable. Except for "Yanmei Kaiping No. 2 crumbs," which had external routes, the rest were dull and flat. However, "Kaiping No. 2 crumbs" from Pudong Wharf were slightly affected by the delivery certificate issued by the association, and the market price slightly decreased. The local coal industry association had previously applied to the Fuel Management Committee of the Ministry of Economic Affairs for an allocation of 5,000 tons of bituminous coal for retail to more than 500 companies. The allocation included 1,000 tons of "Kai Luan No. 1 crumbs" at a price of 150,000 yuan, 1,000 tons of "Kai Luan train blocks" at a price of 170,000 yuan, and 3,000 tons of "Kai Luo No. 2" and the payments were completed at the end of last month. The companies could collect delivery certificates from the association with their payment receipts. However, most of the delivery certificates mentioned above were for small amounts and for delivery at the Pudong Wharf. Small companies found the delivery process cumbersome and therefore sold them on the market.</p>
<p>The cost of firewood and charcoal increased due to high grain prices in the producing areas, causing a large difference between the cost and Shanghai's market price, affecting arrivals. Therefore, the market price was also slightly tighter, but actual sales remained sluggish.</p>
<h3>Sugar Sales Sluggish</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market was weak due to sluggish sales, and prices continued to decline. In the morning, medium sand white sugar initially sold for 66,500 yuan, then 66,000 yuan, and further decreased to 64,500 yuan. In the afternoon, it decreased by another 500 yuan to 64,000 yuan, a drop of 3,000 yuan in total. The "Hao" brand opened with a batch of "Diao Qing" sugar at a price of 51,000 yuan, also down 1-3,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Several dozens of packages of ordinary "yuan zao" (dried jujubes) opened yesterday. They were softer and inferior in color and size, priced at 36,000 yuan. Over ten boxes of high-end "yuan rou" (longan pulp) opened. The goods were still good, priced at 100,500 yuan.</p>
<h3>Tea Prices Firm</h3>
<p>The tea market has benefited from good demand in Suzhou, Tianjin and other places, and those who held goods were also firm in price, so the prices of some varieties have risen. New Longjing is also stable, and the special green tea most favored by the United States and Mumbai, India, is also showing signs of recovery. Yesterday, the Wu Chang Tea Industry Company took in about 400 boxes of Wuyuan goods at an opening price of 35,000 yuan per dan. It is planned to pack and ship them to South America when the shipping schedule is near.</p>
<h3>The Ups and Downs of the Gold Rush: The Central Bank Throws Out Over 3,000 Bars of Sha Chi Within Three Days</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] According to related sources, the abnormal fluctuations in gold prices in this city in the past two days were greatly affected by a Reuters dispatch from New York on the 28th. The dispatch reported that the U.S. House of Representatives Monetary Committee had proposed raising the U.S. gold price. However, the source vehemently condemned the local speculators for quoting out of context. The latter part of the dispatch clearly stated that the U.S. Treasury Department opposed raising the gold price, so the chances of this proposal being discussed in the House were extremely slim. However, the market was unaware and fell victim to the conspiracy of speculators. Nevertheless, the Central Bank continued to follow its past policy and sold gold as the market moved. On the 29th, it sold 766 bars to the Gold Industry Association and 100 bars to the silverware industry at a price of 1.68 million. At that time, the market was still strong and the situation was still firm. The Central Bank then continued to sell more than 500 bars to the market, with prices fluctuating slightly according to the market. On the 30th, the market trend was still firm, and the Central Bank continued to sell 1,170 bars to the Gold Industry Association and 250 bars to the silverware industry at a price of 1.85 million. As the market was still floating, the Central Bank then sold more than 400 bars to the market, with selling prices ranging from a high of 1.92 million yuan to 1.76 million yuan. The market finally collapsed, and the Central Bank continued to sell relentlessly. Yesterday, the Central Bank continued to sell 275 bars to the Gold Industry Association at a price of 1.74 million yuan. The silverware industry had no appetite. In addition, it continued to sell more than 80 bars to the market, with selling prices ranging from 1.715 million yuan to 1.7 million yuan. Therefore, today the market has presented a one-sided situation, finally falling to a low price of 1.63 million yuan. In the past three days, the Central Bank has sold more than 3,500 gold bars, and a large amount of market speculation funds have been absorbed. The unofficial interest rate has risen sharply. It is said that there are many financial institutions that lack funds. The Central Bank will temporarily not provide them with the convenience of adjusting funds because they do not examine their lending policies, which only increases the amount of market speculation funds, so that they will know to be alert. Also, when gold prices fluctuated in the past two days, the number of those who asked the Central Bank to settle foreign exchange funds suddenly increased. After the Central Bank's generous supply, no one asked to settle foreign exchange yesterday.</p>
<p>Another report: It is rumored that the Central Bank will establish an International Foreign Exchange Review Committee. When the reporter inquired about it, it was informed that there was no news.</p>
<h3>A Large Quantity of Northeast Pig Bristles</h3>
<p>Being Received and Taken Away by the Soviet Union: Bristle Prices May Be Hit</p>
<p>Recently, qualified people in the pig bristle industry learned that the price of the international pig bristle market may fluctuate recently. The reason is not due to the improvement and invention of substitutes, but due to the risk of a large number of special goods entering the market. The source of these goods is quite tortuous. When the Japanese invaded China, the United States did not sympathize. Although it still traded gasoline or cast iron, it was limited to cash transactions. The Japanese had extremely limited foreign exchange, so they scoured China's Northeast for export materials to support themselves. Pig bristles were abundant in the Northeast, and the Japanese collected them in many ways. When the Pacific War broke out, a portion had not been shipped out. Although the road to the UK was cut off, the collection continued to increase. When the atomic bomb exploded in Hiroshima, the Soviet Union took advantage of the situation and entered. This textile also changed hands. After the war, the Soviet Union also needed to import a large number of materials, but had no accumulated foreign exchange. These costless goods would inevitably be dumped on the international market at a lower price. The quantity is extremely alarming. It is estimated that there are more than 200,000 customs dan. These "black goods" have been discovered recently.</p>
<h3>British Bank to Increase Gold Purchases</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 1st] According to a dispatch from the special correspondent of this agency: "The Bank of England" is likely to slightly increase its current gold purchase price of 172 shillings and three pence per ounce, in order to be closer to the U.S. price of 173 shillings and eight pence. Since 1945, the price difference between gold in the UK and the US has always been one shilling and five pence.</p>

<p>— Ouli</p>
<p>In the mountainous areas of northern Fujian, there is a lot of cedar production. Cedar grows very quickly. In one or two decades, it can be several zhang high and can be cut down for use or sale.</p>
<p>It is said that in these cedar-producing areas, villagers have a special custom. Whenever a family in the village has a newborn, when the baby is one month old or one year old, relatives and friends gather together to fence off a plot of land and plant cedar seedlings as a congratulatory gift. When the child is twenty years old and about to get married, the plot of land planted with cedar trees given by relatives and friends has already become a towering forest, becoming a very valuable cedar forest. It is said that many villagers rely on such a living "gift" from relatives and friends to start a family and career.</p>
<p>This kind of constructive congratulatory gift is much more meaningful and practical than sending flower baskets or sweets and biscuits.</p>
<p>This kind of living gift is worthy of our emulation.</p>

<h3>"Food" and Children's Mental Health</h3>
<p>— Liu Lunci</p>
<p>Children often have many problems with their clothing, food, and daily life that require parents to study and address. Now, focusing solely on the item of "food," there are quite a few issues. For example, some children insist on eating certain foods while refusing to eat others, some need someone to tell them stories while they eat, some eat very slowly, and some refuse to eat if the bowls and utensils they use are changed. There are countless examples like these. Parents should understand that the occurrence of these bad habits is not without cause, nor is it something that happens overnight. To seek remedies and treatment, parents must first study children's psychology and gain a thorough understanding, and then find ways to deal with it.</p>
<p>The reasons why children refuse to eat, besides being because they are physically uncomfortable or because they have already eaten sweets and snacks before meals, so they do not feel hungry at mealtime, are mostly psychological. Some children who have always been spoiled by their parents need their parents to beg them to do everything, so they must wait for their parents to persuade them to eat before they are willing to eat, or parents grant children's every request, and if sometimes their requests are not granted, then they develop an attitude of hatred and resistance, and use refusing to eat as a threat. Their mentality is "If you don't agree to me, I won't eat." In addition, there are many other cases where psychological imbalances lead to children's loss of appetite or reduced food intake, such as the anxiety that occurs when school exams are approaching, the excitement and desire caused by preparing to attend a banquet, and the bad emotions caused by the destruction of beloved toys, failing school exams, and discord among family members.</p>
<p>The most foolish way to deal with children who refuse to eat is to not study the cause but simply force or coax them to eat. It is best not to leave their side while children are eating, or to coax them by saying, "Good boy, have another bite!" for fear that they have not eaten enough. Sometimes the more you coax them to eat, the less they want to eat. On the contrary, if you ignore them, they will eat obediently. When we find that children's refusal to eat is due to acting spoiled, making demands, and other displays of temper, then let them not eat. There is no need to beg or coax them. Occasionally missing a meal or two will not affect their health. On the contrary, if they eat once because of your begging, then it will make them develop a "me first" mentality, and every time they eat in the future, it will be necessary to have your begging. Once this kind of bad psychological habit is formed, its harm is actually more serious than missing a meal or two. Vomiting is also a problem related to children's eating. The reasons for vomiting are mostly because many gases are swallowed into the stomach while eating, or because they eat too much. Physiologically, it is generally because they suffer from congenital pyloric stenosis, where the pylorus of the stomach is too narrow, causing food to be blocked when it passes through the pylorus, which requires surgical treatment. The reasons for vomiting can also be pathological and psychological. But how do we determine whether children's vomiting is due to a physical illness or a psychological imbalance? First, a detailed examination should be made of the body. For example, if children suffer from brain tumors, meningitis, poliomyelitis, and acute febrile diseases, the physiological changes that occur during the onset period can cause vomiting. As for vomiting caused by psychological imbalances, the characteristic is that their vomiting often comes particularly easily, and at the same time, although they often vomit, it does not affect their nutrition. If it is found that the vomiting is indeed pathological, it needs to be treated with medicine. If it is due to a psychological imbalance, then it is necessary to study whether the environment in which the child lives is good, whether their life is reasonable, whether the schoolwork is too strict, and the level of intelligence, personality, and emotional issues, and then give appropriate treatment.</p>
<p>In short, children's "food" problems should be developed from the beginning of breastfeeding, forming a good habit, with appropriate quality and quantity, giving food on time, and adhering to it without change. Never be accommodating because the child cries, nor should you be too doting and offer frequent attentiveness. They should be given adequate rest after playing before eating. Arguments should not be held in front of children before meals, causing their emotional tension. Parents should take a consistent attitude towards training children's habits. Parents should set a good example when eating. Snacking should be prohibited before and after meals, away from the temptation of food, and the child's life should be properly adjusted, because many children love to snack, mostly due to the monotony of their spiritual life and being tempted by food. Even many adults stop children from making noise and crying by giving them food, or say hastily, "Go buy pastries," "Go buy sweets." These wrong measures and words need to be corrected urgently.</p>
<p>If parents can do all of the above, then children will not have "food" problems, and even if they do occur, they will be easy to solve.</p>

<h3>Small Apron</h3>
<p>— Xiao Shufang</p>
<p>This is a small apron suitable for girls aged three or four. Most of the current season's clothing is made of woolen materials, and children easily get their clothes dirty. This apron can be worn at any time. If it is made well, it will add to the neatness and beauty when worn. Materials: Two to three feet of plain light-colored cloth or cloth with small red and blue flowers, red and blue cloth for trimming.</p>
<p>Instructions: Cut according to the dimensions in the diagram, slightly enlarged to allow for seams. The length can be adjusted according to the size of the child. Make a sandwich layer for the waist, with two loops at each end for the straps to cross through and tie a bow when wearing. The top of the bib, the bottom of the apron, and the two pockets are trimmed with non-fading red and blue. In the summer, it can also be worn as a backless little suit!</p>
<h3>Ballad of the Stepmother</h3>
<p>— Ba Ling</p>
<p>"Little Cabbage, yellow in the field; A three-year-old child has lost their mother! Follow your father and live well, but I fear father taking a stepmother. The stepmother married for a full three years, gave birth to a son stronger than me; he eats meat, I drink soup, crying and weeping, I miss my own mother."</p>
<p>This is a ballad of children dissatisfied with their stepmother. It fully exposes the common situation of stepmothers discriminating against the children of the former wife. This is also a family problem worthy of attention.</p>
<p>It is hoped that women who are stepmothers will broaden their horizons and recognize that children belong to the nation, not to individuals or families, and that cultivating outstanding citizens of the next generation is their sacred duty. If one can hold this view, mistreatment will naturally not occur.</p>

<h3>Ramblings on Choosing a Spouse</h3>
<p>— Yang Zhimin</p>
<p>Mr. Shuofeng said: "A wife's mood is like a barometer in the family; a loving and happy wife is like a sunny day; if she is perverse, it is like a stormy weather." Indeed, most of the happiness and troubles in a family depend on the wife. A wife with a kind heart will inevitably make the family happy; otherwise, even if the family does not break up, it will at least not be happy and joyful. Therefore, the first secret to choosing a spouse is to consider her "mood."</p>
<p>Secondly, because a woman's mood is mostly formed by the combination of her mother's inheritance and the environment in which she lives. If the mother is a "shrew," and usually does not treat her husband with any dignity, then her daughter, having been influenced by her, will treat her husband the same way in the future. If the mother is a capable housewife, who is diligent and thrifty at home, and treats her husband as herself, then her daughter will be as diligent and harmonious as her mother in the future. Therefore, in addition to considering her mood, you should also carefully consider everything about her mother.</p>
<p>External "beauty" is certainly a great seductive power for women, and can also be used as a standard for choosing a spouse. However, many young people mistakenly regard it as the only standard, because external beauty will soon disappear. No matter how black your hair is, it will turn gray; no matter how apple-like your face is, it will become old. Therefore, external beauty is a beauty of time, and a beauty of time will be eliminated by time after a considerable period.</p>
