<h3>馬歇爾等即由渝出發　視察停止衝突情形　東北共軍又發動攻勢</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿四日急電〕近由東北抵此者談！東北境內之共軍，實陽不足二萬人，尚係由熱察兩省轉往者，所謂土八路，亦不過三四萬人，但原屬僞滿陸軍，由外力協助加盟共軍，自稱所謂人民軍者，的有十萬。土八路武器較劣，共軍及僞軍半數以上已獲得日式裝備，最先與國軍杜聿明部接觸，即山共軍指揮之偽軍，然戰志均不旺，如無外力支持，有瓦解可能。</p>
<p>〔合衆社重慶廿四日電〕調處執行部軍事小組委員會委員馬歇爾，　恩來，張治中，預定於數日內離渝前往衝突區視察，允注朮華北各區。同行者有中國特派員一名，美國特派員四名，彼等之第一目的地爲北平。</p>
<p>〔聯合社北平廿四日電〕據此間可靠方面消息：美國特使馬歇爾擬在中國各地作大規模考察，預定一二日內自渝來此。馬使此行將經歷張家口·延安·瀋陽及華北各區，視察停戰協定執行情形，然後轉往京滬·武漢·廣州，而於三月九日左右返渝，傳外長王世杰及中共代表周恩來將同行。</p>
<p>〔合衆社北平廿四日電〕此間華文報紙載中央社電訊稱：東北共軍「自四面八方」發動攻勢，目的在奪取瀋陽以南四十五哩之新民，並切斷國軍與該城之鐵路綫聯繫。該電訊謂，共軍同時對東北共他六個城市進攻，共軍經兩日夜之攻學，將國軍逐出新民附近之秀水河子後，其攻勢即遭擊退。國軍乃發動反攻，將共軍逐回至康平及法庫以外，據稱：共軍配置重砲十尊，野砲三十尊。又據報，共軍正向盤山、南陵、台安、遼中、彰武等處進攻，並破壞交通綫。</p>
<p>〔聯合社重慶廿四日電〕據傳，東北國軍正在瀋陽西北一百八十華里之彰武，瀋陽北面一百五十華里之法庫，遭受共軍攻擊。又聞錦縣以北發生小衝突。</p>
<p>〔路透社重慶廿四日電〕河北省政府接該省南部永年縣府之告急電稱：「吾人被共產軍圍困幾已達六月，全城已成飢城，日有餓死者，居民僅恃草根樹皮爲生。」</p>

<h3>東蒙問題眞相透露　向政府請求自治　代表團抵平謁熊式輝商談</h3>
<p>〔本報北平廿三日電〕蒙代表抵平後，熊式輝曾於其私邸，以接待一普通國民之形式，接見　尼巴達拉一行七人，並曾設宴招待。據消息靈通者稱，當局對彼等能於蘇軍駐防區內，召開意志自由之人民大會，且於治安混亂中得以從容自蒙到達長春，表示懷疑。當局並表示實行自治爲國內各地一致之要求，亦爲總理遺敎所明載，但在程度上，應爲一致的，而無高度中度低度之分。至於扶叻弱小民族，目前我國五族並無强者，皆爲弱小，我等正宜如緊團結，共謀富强，至於東蒙代表所提自治要求，目前實無法答覆與解次，因迄今此等地區蘇軍尚未撇去許我接收也。東蒙代表團原擬至重慶，但能吾成行，尚須視北平商談情形而定。</p>
<p>〔本報北平廿三日電〕東蒙古代表之蒞平，已證實東蒙問題不如前傳之嚴重，但整個內蒙自治間題，則將重新掀起，以瑪尼巴達拉爲首席之東蒙代表團，在此問　稱，東蒙自自治政府雖已成立，但未成立東蒙自治共和國，彼等南來係向政府請求自治，並無妨害國家統一意圖云。東蒙自治政府爲應臨時需要而組織，如內蒙自治問題整個解次，東蒙　獨自治機構，亦可取消，彼等此種主張，顯已予故都蒙古人士以頗大之影響。一九三三年宣嚷一時之內蒙自治，殆已重新成爲一般蒙人之話題。</p>
<p>廿三日下午四時蒙古旅平同鄉百餘人，假中央公園來今雨軒，歡迎東蒙代表團，中委白雲梯，立委吳雲鵬，蒙藏會駐平辦事處長何兆麟等，政界蒙籍人士亦參加　東蒙代表團首席代表瑪尼巴達拉即席致詞稱，彼等之自治機構係兵慌馬亂中基於地方需要而成立，蘇方未予帮助，亦未加幹涉，共產軍距自治區甚近，但未進入該區，亦未干涉蒙旗之事務，彼等中心擁護扶助弱小民族之三民主義，其他主義則非蒙人所樂從，彼等甚望中央本總理扶助弱小民族遺敎，對內蒙問題作一致解次。彼等之所以成立東蒙自治政府與代表東蒙要求自治，並非意圖分裂內蒙，乃因樂蒙處水深火熱之中，迫切希求問題解決，加以交通梗阻，未獲　西蒙聯繫，更未獲得西蒙同意，故一切皆僅稱東蒙。彼敘述東蒙自治機構之誕生稱，八一五後大軍過境，土匪蜂起，地方秩序不寗，治安維持會於焉成立，該會成立後立即取消偽滿一切有害蒙人之稗政，並剿辦匪股，五十人以上之大批土匪，已不能立足，全境之兵士公務員爲全體之利益幸福着想，皆枵腹從公，白盡義務，中等以上學校學生萬餘人，並奔馳兩區，傳達消息，協助推行政令，厥功甚偉，言及該區人民大會稱，各旗代表頗多自遼遠之地區趕來有歷月餘始達者，彼等途中恒於冰天雪地之原野露宿過夜。瑪尼巴達拉對蘇軍軍紀未予恭維，謂蘇大軍近百萬，官少兵多，難於約束，軍紀蕩然，以彼本人所知，哲里木盟之賓土旗蒙民財產，因此損失四分之一。後至瀋陽，始賓土旗之損失，尚屬輕徵，故今日蒙民生活，實已大成問題。瑪氏之蒙語演說，拈詞優美週密，而富於煽動性，其結尾詞稱，我等於遼遠之東蒙，對諸君極爲懷念，今得與諸位同聚一堂，且目睹衆多英俊育年之棟樑，衷心不勝興奮，喜極生悲，語竟放聲一哭，合座爲之泫然。瑪致詞前有平蒙古同鄉代表汪自洋老國會議員致歡迎詞，亦强調自治，爲蒙人一致之要求。</p>

<h3>一座古城將躍爲全國中心　蘭州急奏太平鼓</h3>
<p>— 本報航訊　陳前寄自蘭州</p>
<p>青年立志在邊疆　「中國之命運」</p>
<p>如果你說這裏是邊疆，那麽，我且問你：倘若外蒙沒有獨立，西藏重歸我國版輿的話，全國的中心是布那裏？</p>
<p>我可以回答：是蘭州。不渦，誰也知道這裏與內地不地同的，是「交通不便，文化閉塞」而已。這是不能抹煞的事實。但在抗戰駈，這個後方小小的占城，也盡其最大力量，不失共地方重要性。</p>
<p>說起又是　話重提，是我們與盟國並肩抗戰的時期，尤其廿七，廿八年間，蘇聯雖然還沒參加反侵略的神聖戰爭，但不斷的供給我們軍火，派遣軍官來華協助，所以這時的蘭州，整個城市也被火　氣息　染了。到目下，本地人有口皆碑，都說是廿八年舊歷正月初二，我們空軍曾在這裏「予打擊者以打擊，」完成了光榮戰略，那犬敵機由運城經過陜西上空，飛到這裏，當然有他的企圖，可是我們也有相當準備，給他一個迎頭痛擊，在我們一　機關手百發百中的神技之下，一日間打下九架。</p>
<p>拉一車鈔票　可在街頭慢慢走</p>
<p>過了二天，是正月初五，又打下六架。誰都說是過得一個痛快年。也許是日寇給我們送個禮吧。現在有一部份戰利品，還在民衆敎育館國防展覽室陳列着，血跡斑斑，參觀者見到，誰也都浮起勝利的微　。</p>
<p>朱一民將軍與谷正倫先生，在這裏分任軍政主管。朱一民將軍，坐鎭這裏已經多年，在剛柔並濟之下，與鄰省的馬鴻達馬步茅兩主席相處得不　，也許是回敎姓馬的特別多，與朱將單來往較好，說到谷先生，誰也知道他當過憲兵司令，你休說他已經有一部　子老了，共實呢，他身爲主席兼保安司令，素稱「烟毒城的閘州，現在却是推行肅淸烟毒非常嚴岐的地方。在這裏你可以放心　拉着一車鈔票，照樣可在街上慢慢走。</p>
<p>冰季的亭受　驢聲輪影兩不絕</p>
<p>黃河鐵橋，是全國三大鐵橋之一，是與新經，靑海，寧夏，公路交通必疆之路，橋上行人憑眺南北岸景色，有如投入奇域之感，當着波浪打着橋石，嘩嘩的響，眞像在行舟途中，但現在已聽不到水聲，橋下也可以走人，因爲河水已經冰凍了。每年這時驢馬輪影，轆轆不絕於河心，不止是勞力人得到簡便之路，一般摩登少男女，也提着冰鞋到這裏來，享受他們的青春愉快——天然冰塲。不過立育以後，河冰快化了。治安當局已禁止行人，黃河又要咆哮了，水流時，也見不到船影，惟有那原始式的羊牛皮裂成筏子，順流而下，則「漁光曲」一般的意境便愈自然湧現。</p>
<p>特殊建築物　號稱「三小三大」</p>
<p>這裏的建築很特別。有城門，又有一重關，關却比城大，所以　州有「三小三大」之稱呼。這就是城小關大，車小輸大，房小坑大。西關有個臥橋，（握橋），是一座木橋，眞是「長橋臥波」的老建築，新式的建築有忠烈嗣，（在谷主席贊助下建立的，）仿南京中山陵模樣，構造得很不錯。還有西北大厦，（前西北公路局何局長發起，）爲招待中外貴賓之用。九間樓（委座官邸），物產館，（市府建），其餘是私人別　居多，集中大中山林新村，比較粗陋，不過較之山上窰洞（貧民住所）却文强得多。占蹟方面，大都是行政機關或軍隊辦公所在地，不能「細看」，所以也不能「細說了」。</p>
<p>這裏是避暑勝地，好甜瓜，好氣候，胖子來此，可以少流汗，搜子可以養得壯些。秋風起時，吃一碗羊肉泡饃，包你增加熱力。冬天，冰凍軟兒梨，新鮮百合，都是圍爐細點。說到春天，三月桃花開遍大地，十里郊外春色最多，踏靑尋芳，也都是爲了桃花。這正如上海人之爭看龍華桃花一樣熱鬧。</p>
<p>春郊看桃花</p>
<p>新年狂打太平鼓</p>
<p>如今春天又到了，桃花又爲誰開？你坐車，我走路，你爲了花，我也爲了花。</p>
<p>農曆新年，此間「鬧忙」之至。第一個濃厚表現着地方色彩的是「社伙」，其中尤其以「太平鼓」爲最精彩。每一社都有十幾個鼓手，打着十分響亮的鼓聲，誰都爲這太平鼓動了心。抗戰八年，每年都在打，今年還在繼續打，打吧！更響亮的打。—希望打出眞正的太平來。</p>
<p>你如果說上海是一座「動」的城，那麼我說蘭州是「靜」的城。她靜如處女，玉立亭亭，何以大家不爲她「忠貞」而動憐情呢？我爲她呼喚。我同感於蔣先生在「中國之命運」中的一句話「靑年立志在邊疆」，更何况這個邊疆又是全國的中心呢？（元宵太平鼓聲中）。</p>

<h3>我們對於雅爾達　秘密協定的抗議</h3>
<p>一九四六年二月十一日，華盛頓·倫敦·莫斯科三地同時公佈了上年同日在雅爾達會議中由　斯福·邱吉爾·史達林三人議定的秘密協定。其中包括承認外蒙的獨立，中蘇共管中東南滿兩路，租借大連旅順兩市港，以爲蘇聯在德國投降三國月後對日宣戰的代價。中國在反侵略戰爭中，抗戰的時問最久，所受的損害最重，不意美蘇英三國竟訂立這樣的秘密協定，侵犯他們盟邦中國的領土主權，破壞了自華盛頓九國公約以迄開羅會議尊重中國領土主權的莊嚴諾言。這一秘密協定，違背了聯合國共同作戰的理想和目標，開創今後强力政治外秘密外交的惡例，影響所及，足以破壞今後世界的和平，重踏人類罪惡的覆轍。這一秘密協定，實爲近代外交史上最失道義的一個紀錄。</p>
<p>雅爾達會議的召開，正在中國中原湘桂各次戰役失利以後，原子彈尚未成功以前。羅斯福在兩面作戰的形勢下，急於要求蘇聯對日宣戰，其處　心情，我們容能了解。但不顧道義，違背本心，同意蘇聯的要求，侵犯中國的領土主權，其事絕不可恕。羅斯福及其領導的美　，在中國人民心靈上，原佔有極其友好的地位，但這種地位，已因雅爾達秘密協定，大受打擊。我們絕不能因爲羅斯福在這次整個的戰爭中所作的貢獻，以及他過去對於中國的問情及援助，就原宥他這次的過失和責任。</p>
<p>自九一八以來，英國對於中國的抵抗日本，從來缺乏公平固有效的援助，甚至竟一度封鎖中國的唯一國際交通，以求對日的妥協。這種態度久已有失公這。邱吉爾在雅爾達會議以前，曾故意誇大英國對華的援助。他蔑視中國在這次戰爭中的貢獻及其應佔有的地位。在雅爾達會議上，他顯然背負了爲英國盟邦的中爾，這完全是一種不榮譽的行爲。</p>
<p>蘇聯在雅爾達會議中的要求，完全違反對侵略的法西斯國家共同作戰的目的。違反列寧先生與中山先生共同建設的中蘇友愛的新基礎。違反蘇聯多次的對外宣言，尤其是對華放棄帝俄時代不平等條約的宣言。違反對大西洋憲章以來各重要文件的精神。蘇聯所標務的是打倒帝國主義，然則今日蘇聯要求恢復其「俄羅斯帝國之權利」，又何以自解？蘇聯乘人之難，提出這種要求，其異於帝俄對中國之行爲者何在？這種行爲，難免造成今後世界戰禍的因素。爲中國，爲世界，我們不得不提出嚴厲的抗議。</p>
<p>我們認爲這個雅爾達秘密協定是這次戰爭中最失道義最不榮譽的一個文件；它打銷了聯合國家參加反侵略戰爭的神聖性。蘇美英三國應根據開羅宣言及莫斯科四國宜言的精神，勇敢而坦白地承爲三國對於中國所犯的過失·蘇聯尤應自動放棄其帝俄時代的政策，以難讓其素所主張的國際正義·中國政府應將這一問題及最近東北各種震驚人心的發展，全部公關；要求聯合國調查，用以杜絕今後任何可能類此的秘密外交，並以避免東北重爲世界大戰的因素。關於目前的局勢，中國政府，除在蘇聯同樣履行其條約義務的條件下，履行其所簽訂的中蘇條約中所應履行的義務外，不得再有任何喪失國家土權及利益的行爲。我們希望全國上下，不分黨派，一致團結，監督政府，迫促政府，努力爭取中國在國際社會中的平等地位，及其主權，領土，及行政之完聲。</p>

<h3>鹽政改革管見（續）</h3>
<p>— 徐爾信</p>
<p>之收買運銷，旣歸國營鹽樂公司專資辦理，鹽務行政　關對公司之一切營業行爲，固居於監督指導之地位。但　務行政機關亦有其主管之事項，亟待舉辦，庶使公司之業務，易於推動，而獲得成效，舉其重要者如下：</p>
<p>整理塲產</p>
<p>鹽務根本，應重場產之整理。無論採就場征稅制，或專賣制，必須對於鹽塲，能作切實嚴密與有效之管理，方能使場私不致走漏。整理場產之事項（一）鹽戶灶了，一律辦理登記，所有灘池灶井，暨製產方法與用具，均須清查明確，經核准許可以後，方准製產。（二）產鹽地方築路濬河工程之進行，俾便於鹽之運輸歸倉。（三）運鹽入倉蛇所用舟車之登記。（四）產少滷淡成本高昻，零星散漫之塲灘，予以查封廢除。（五）情况變更，與管理不便之場區，酌予合併。（六）製產方法之促進改良，並　設製鹽示範塲。（七）產地氣象之詳細記錄。（八）鹽戶灶了編列戶籍，組設保甲。（九）稽查製產。（十）檢騐鹽質。</p>
<p>建築倉索</p>
<p>各鹽塲須一律建築倉坨，其動額與容積，視其產量與交通情形而定。並以集中建築爲原則，但酌量塲產情形，分段建置，（福建各塲坎地無鹽溝，祗能就坎建坨）。以便利鹽戶將製成之鹽歸坨。原有私人建築之倉坨，由政府給價收買或租用。凡各省交通要衝，運銷匯集之處，並宜建置規模較大之官倉，如鄂岸之漢口新隄，湘岸之岳陽長沙衡陽，西岸之九江湖口，皖岸之蕪湖大通，均已規劃建置在先，抗戰期間，如有燬損，宜亟行修理。其他各省，並宜從速擇地倣照建置。此項鹽倉所存之鹽，多爲轉往各地，備配運濟銷之用，如宋時之轉般倉。各銷岸之縣市地方，至少應建置富倉一所至數所，其客量至少須足敷當地銷額三月至六月之用，並須以其中之一部分，包含有常平鹽之性質經常儲存，爲　產之年，或枯水之委，或臨時接濟不及之時，或遇兵禍天災之日，供準備之用。（按宋元豐時，遠地須豫備二年或三年，次遠一年至二年，最近亦半年及一年，謂之豫備鹽。紹聖間沿用舊制，廣有凖備，責轉運使般送，更及元豐準備之數。可見宋時已已重視各地倉鹽之儲積。）倉坨建置完備，在塲產方面，固可杜絕走私，在銷岸則可調劑供求，平衡價格，中間剝削階級之批發商，即無存在之餘地，而私人國積居奇，亦無所售其計。（未完）</p>

<p>國民代表會對於前款複次事項之次議，經關係院表示異議時，得以國民代表三分二以上之同意，提請國民大會解次之（抗止權，抗行權）。</p>
<p>但關於宣戰，媾和，戒嚴等案，或立法院認爲係緊急性質之次議案，總統亦得依行政會議之次議，逕自執行；或依立法院之次議，逕行公布，共責任仍由國民代表會提請國民大會解決之。關於預算案，非另經總統之同意，不得提請國民大會解決。</p>

<p>前項各提案，在國民代表會閉會期間，亦得提出之；但立法院認爲係緊急性　之決議案，應付　決時，國民代表會應即召集臨時會。</p>
<p>上開設計，以與五五憲草原文相比較，其特點頗多，茲分述之：</p>
<p>一·本設計所定國民代表會與國民大會職權，均嚴格限定在四種政權範圍之內，且各有界限，故無籠統混淆之流弊。</p>
<p>二·草案所定國民代表名額，至多約爲三千人。本設計各縣市議員之　　，以每群五十人計，至少當有十餘萬人。以十餘萬人代次國家大政，自較三千人之集會爲「民主」。</p>
<p>三·各縣市議員本有具體的合議體之組織，故投票人數雖多，仍不至各不相謀，過度渙散；且每一投票案件，議會在投票以前，旣不妨就可吾雙方理由，爲公開之討論，長暗中活動之情弊，自少發生可能。</p>
<p>四·有形制易受野心家操縱利用，本設計各種電大核定權均不在有形之國民代表會，即選舉權亦復分爲兩橛，投票權旣分散在全國各地，故此種流弊，必大可减免。</p>
<p>五·國民代表會人數，以適於集議爲度，故較草案之三千人爲輕而易舉。</p>
<p>六·國民代表由各縣市議會暫行代選，可免直接選舉之煩費，並有隨時發動罷免代表之便利。國民代表各有常任機關監臨於其後，自允不至妄行非義。</p>
<p>七·國民代表會一年開會兩次，會期得以自由伸縮，其分子又係每年改選半數，足使該會與中央政府之間，發生密切之監臨關係，不至互相隔膜。</p>
<p>八·國民代表會係補助國民大會之機關，而非範統的代行政權之機關。凡重大案件，其最終決定權，仍在大會自身；故國民代表次不能濫權專斷，因綠爲市，一如普通代議機關之議員。</p>
<p>九·國民代表會雖有監督或統制中央政府之權，但無直接指揮任免之權。各院對代表會之次議，且仍得表示抗議。故與現制國防最高會議，及過去中央政治會　之性質根本不同，次無併吞五權，形成太上政府之危險。</p>
<p>十·國民代表會又對國民大會負責，其主張如爲大會所不取，即須解散改組；故代表會必能主持正義，不致輕啓事端，致危及其自身。</p>
<p>十一·五權之運用，其相互問之糾紛，勢難避免。草案所定總統得召集五院院長會商（第四十五條），究非具有決定權之固定機關；而特設常任機關之法，又有形成太上政府之虞，故頗難揹置。本設計國民代表會之設，有常任機關之利，而無其　。</p>
<p>政治協商會議，所定憲草修改原則，一方使國民大會爲無形組織，一方又使立法監察兩院成爲與兩院制議會相似之物，並令行政院對立法院負責。此與五權憲法理論，大相刺矛。倘採上開設計，則中央政制自仍當以草案爲本而予以硏討。（完）</p>

<p>本市在敵偽盤據時期，敵方爲建築飛機塲及其他軍用設施，曾在本市四郊如江灣吳淞虹橋大場等地强徵民田達十萬餘畝之多，且在指定區域內所有房屋，亦需拆除，不給任何費用。被害農民當時因迫於淫威，呼籲無門，茲悉市地政局爲保障人民權益起見，已規定凡經敵人强徵之土地，如事實上無需用之價値，均予以發還，故市民可携同證件逕向該局申請，經該局查核後，即轉請有關常局發還。</p>

<h3>大量鐵路器材　運抵本市集中　客車二千輛在運華途中</h3>
<p>聯合國善後救濟總署已有機車六十餘輛貨章七百餘輛，運抵我國，一部份除已在九龍起運上岸外，餘均在本市集中，由交通部統籌支配。並悉尚有客車二千餘輛，已在運華途中。此外尚有大量鋼軌及鐵路材料，亦將陸續候輪待運，如該批物資運抵後，我國各鐵路錢交通狀况當可迅速改善。據關係方面估計，目前需由國外輸人交通器材一四〇萬公噸，作爲修理國內各主要交通綫之用，惟上項數字，以敵人毀壞之程度而言，尚不能恢復戰前標準，可見我國交通建設在戰爭時受損之慘重云。</p>

<h3>電訊工潮　陷於僵局</h3>

<h3>海外定價增高　五金供求失調　新老鋼廠尙未報價</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕近日海外五金定價，較上星期的高起一二成不等，惟正式新老鋼廠所出品之貨色，尚未獲得當局許可，故猶無市價報來，聞關於軍用品諸貨物，仍受統制，非有許可證，不能裝船來華，由子國外定價增高，及黑市外匯猖獗，推波逐浪，遂使本埠貨價突飛猛晉，漫無止境，加以海外到貨殊爲少數，供求失衡，一時難望下瀉，茲將最近海外五金定價列表如下：</p>

<h3>世界四大產糧國　本年存底減少</h3>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓二十四日電〕美國農業部宣布，世界輸出穀物最多之國家，本年內存底之少，爲一九四〇年以來所未有，小麥之存底，較去年初的少百分之二十五，美國加拿大阿根廷及澳洲全部小麥供應僅一三九二〇〇〇〇〇〇布許爾，一四一九四五年初則有一八六八〇〇〇〇〇〇布許爾之多，可供輸出之過剩額，約在四七五〇〇〇〇〇〇與五〇〇〇〇〇〇〇〇布許爾之間，遠較世界各國需要之輸入額爲少，本年四國黑麥供應較去年亦少一五〇〇〇〇〇〇布許爾，阿根廷可有少許餘額輸出，其餘三國均無出口之望，本年大麥供應約三五二〇〇〇〇〇〇希許爾，去年初則有三九四〇〇〇〇〇〇布許爾，今年燕麥產量較多，然足供輸出之量亦極少，稻類等產量共二〇二〇〇〇〇〇〇布許爾，而去年有二三一一〇〇〇〇〇〇布許爾，其中以美國所產减少最多。</p>
<h3>投機家利用流言　上週絲綢狂漲</h3>
<p>上週絲綢市塲因投機者利用無　　言，一般散戶，盲目相從，以致疊創新高價，上週內人造絲週初頗呈頽勢，迎三止一二〇號大橋現貨三日內共跌去二十萬元，不料於週四起，受某種消息刺激，突告反動，一日間漲起五十萬元之鉅，直至週六因棧單禁止交易，人心恐慌，市價方始平疲，結果一週內漲起四十萬元，棧單做至週五止，五日內總計高四十餘萬元，上週廠經洋行無甚交易，廠銷稍有去路，各檔均漲起十二十萬至二十五萬元左右，稠貨週初甚疲軟，週四起又呈活躍，美亞被面週六與週一相較，計高二十萬元，大　格子壁縐計高六百三十元，民生織錦緞漲一千元，林記蠟羽紗大二百五十元，昨日綢市美亞被面做一百三十二萬元，大誠格　縐做四千七百元，比週六俱小百分之五左右，洪康黑白縐每碼六千元，民生織錦緞成交價一萬八千元。</p>
<h3>上週各級棉紗　俱創新高價</h3>
<p>現紗在上週間，因黃金暗市騰踊，一部份紗廠有怠工情事，兼以客帮細紗採辦良好，致市上供給籌碼殊感缺乏，頗有供不敷求之勢，尤以星期五漲勢爲最熾，各級紗俱創空前高價，週六因連日上漲太鉅，一部份多頭獲利出範，市勢略回，結果終於軋漲，全週問以星期五之六十支日光三百五十萬爲最高，星期一之十支同心五十五萬爲最低，其過程高低相差二百九十五萬之鉅，若小支數言，則六十支日光細紗比前週末漲五萬，四十二支及三十二支藍鳳各猛漲四十五萬，四十支藍鳳漲三十五萬，二十支特雙馬漲廿四萬，十六支光明漲十九萬，十支同心漲七萬，布市亦形向榮，計雛鷄士林與四君子嗶嘰各漲六千元，一定如意漂布漲三千元，安安藍布漲五千元，十二磅龍頭細布漲二千元，十六磅粗布約漲三四千元，花市極祇紡建公司採辦爲最健，此外民營紗廠需要平凡，查米特林比前週六漲一萬二千元，大中集漲五千元，三餘鎭漲八千元，太倉花漲五千元，火機花漲五千元，周浦籽花漲五千五百元。</p>
<h3>票據交換所　時間改遲原因</h3>
<p>據上海票據交換所其君云，銀錢業票據交換時間，在戰前向爲下午三時半，其後數次提早，實爲上海淪陷後之事，票據交換所最近將交換時問延遲至下午三時半，純因上海光復之後，金融業務已逐步趨入正軌，特恢復戰前交換時問，使當日銀行錢莊收付得以全部清訖，近有人以爲此係促進支票行使，希冀減少發行，又謂延遲交換可以助長投機，實與事理不符云。</p>

<h3>各地物價齊漲</h3>
<p>〔中央社漢口二十三日電〕此問物價近來波動劇烈，五日來黃金每兩由十四萬挺漲至十七萬，米價每石由兩萬漲至三萬六千，仍有續漲之勢。</p>
<p>〔中央社杭州二十三日電〕杭物價激漲，白米每擔二萬八千元，黃金每兩二十萬八千元，其他日用品亦均各上漲二倍左右，公敎人員暨平以生活，已陷極端困苦之竟。</p>
<p>〔津訊〕外匯率歷久未定之結　，國際貿易商遲疑觀望。津滬間航遝雖通，北貨南運艙位擁擠，無特殊關係即感向隅，故遊資趨向投機，足金美鈔證劵上漲，津滬如出一轍。津外商望裝天津猪鬃運滬待船，皮張銷况允暢。經濟部接收華北電業公司，奉行政院令，十五日起增加電價，的爲原價之五倍。</p>

<h3>今晚籃球聯賽　精彩節目　汕隊鬥巨人</h3>
<p>綠林仁餘有決賽性　薩柯江灣昨俱不到</p>
<p>市體育館球房今日下午五時半起籃球聯賽三場，將有劇烈爭鬥，首場綠隊與V隊之女子組賽前者奪標呼聲濃厚，實力堅硬，惟V隊必努力抗拒，甲二部綠林仁餘有決賽性，蓋仁餘出戰以來，尚保持不敗絕錄，綠林則亦僅不幸小敗于紅隊一場而已，今賽當不能輕易放鬆。衡之兩隊球藝，經騐以仁餘勝，合作綠林好，可謂各有千秋。甲一部汕隊將與巨人鬥，汕隊似非巨人之敵，但在聯賽中，汕隊迄今爲常勝將軍，巨人已先後受恩卡斯及江灣之毒手，以最近情形論，汕隊可能獲勝，據悉汕隊方面有一二健將離滬他去，遭受損失，則又當作別論矣。</p>
<p>又昨日三場，末場薩柯江灣兩番軍俱以故不到，是否作爲雙棄權，須經委員會之決定。女組雪白雪靑姊妹圓牆，勝負一如理想，上半時三三對一五，德結果五五對三七，另幕甲二部德勝戰六分團，上半時德勝極有作爲，以二七對一七佔先，下半時六分團力圖反攻，最後五分鐘內更見有追出之勢，借以時問無幾，上半時失分又多，結果五二對四四，德勝破六分團。今日秩序如下：</p>
<p>綠隊—V隊（女子）五時卅分</p>
<p>綠林—仁餘（甲二）六時一刻</p>
<p>汕隊—巨人（甲一）七時一刻</p>

<p>生產建設特輯</p>
<h3>茶農生產與農貸</h3>
<p>— 王乃益</p>
<p>我國以農立國，農村經濟在全國國民經濟中，佔有極重要地位；所以農村經濟之演變，影響於全國整個經濟機能與社會各階層人民之生活，至大且鉅；而戰後重要國策，首推安定民生。其欲安定民生，又非建設農村生產不能達到治本急務。因之筆者特就農村生產重要部門之茶農與農貸聯繫狀况，作簡略之介紹，期有以促進當道之注意與指導。</p>
<p>迴溯抗戰期問，各地茶農因地方遭受兵燹洗刧，逃匿他地；或因生活高迫，改農從商；或因其他農產物品生息優厚，輒棄茶葉種作，砍折茶樹，改植其他農物，數年間據業中人觀察，被毀茶樹相當驚人，於今思之，實深痛惜。按茶樹被毀以後，若重新播種，須經四五年之後，方可開始採摘；在停採期間，每逢黃梅立秋及白露時節，尚須按時加意施以鬆泥工作，並鋤除雜草，以助茶樹生長，更常須配用人糞油餅等肥料，以培其本，在此重植經過期間，每年不但無利可取，甚且尚須加本培植，所以抗戰期間茶農所受殘害之重大，可以推想而知矣。</p>
<p>勝利以後，失地光復，各區茶農漸有地方安寗保障，國外貿易漸可次第恢復，此刻原應大量出產茶葉，爲國家向他國爭取外匯籌碼；所惜者陳茶存底不豐，而新茶採摘因茶樹被砍過多，一時欲圖大量恢復生產，極覺困難—其中資金問題，亦爲重要因素，蓋數年來受盡剁剝，早已貧乏不堪言狀，焉有餘力爲振發農作之資本，且茶葉之採製運銷各階層，所需長期投資之欵，非有鉅大數字，不足以應付；而若干商業銀行又多不願投資於農業生產部門，以農產需要之資金，其週轉性不若工商業貸放之靈活，期限旣長，而利息亦薄，故經營此項貸欵業務，非國家銀行莫辦也</p>
<p>關於資金之獲取途經，一方有望於政府之籌劃補助；另一方則爲國營銀行之低利貸欲。至於茶農如何接受此項協助金與貸款金，其方式似亦有討論之必要。蓋一般茶作農民，散居各處，缺乏智識，少與外間接觸，縱使內心極欲告貸，徒苦申請無門，若干農民其能托人代謀者，亦多缺少足供保證之財產及殷實商號，若憑農民個人信用出借，又多爲銀行所拒絕；故茶農欲謀獲取資金，必先集合團體，組織茶農合作社，由各區有聲望茶農負責籌設，依法向政府登記，取得法人地位，以爲集體之共同行動，同時政府對於農貸應求其普遍，並確定茶農部門應享之貸放金額，以使茶貸生產可以着手儘速推進，另一方面對於茶農直接貸放，倘一時不易做到，盡可貸交素負聲望之茶商轉貸，因彼此之間交接相常密切，其效果與直接貸放不但無異，且可增加農商合作，促進運銷效果，望政府切實趕速採納建議原則，迅付實施。</p>
<p>最近月來，本市商界投資於新創合茶葉公司行棧　，日見增多，已如雨後春筍，大有蓬勃氣象！內銷路綫，以戰事平定，交通便利，已漸擴暢；而外銷出口貿易，亦已開始，將來外洋海運暢通，其前途當無限量。週前本市著名茶商如汪裕泰茶棧及華茶公司等，已有綠茶一批出口，運往美國銷售。從前數年本市茶商停製之洋裝茶葉，現亦已重振旗鼓，趕工裝製以應時代需要，如汪裕泰茶棧特備之機械製茶工具，亦已開始趕製；其他如振興茶葉公司附設製茶廠等亦在着手加添機械設備，趕製洋裝茶葉，以供外銷。是以近來茶葉業營業之盛况已創數年最高紀錄，茶葉價格因需求殷切，亦隨之增加數倍，其最近升漲比率較任何商品爲大，故經營茶葉者最近多獲利倍蓗，然則因茶價籌碼漲大，經營資金亦倍覺艱難，倘金融機關不爲適量資金之融通者，則茶商目下雖獲鉅利，亦徒覺難以擴展營　他鬨。筆者因念今後茶農生憲與茶商營運肩負責任之重大。因特軍成斯文，述其業中困楚槪况，有期政府當局暨國營金融機關加以密切注視，並設法協助推展之。</p>
<p>前聞行政院會次　　款充收復區緊急農貸，又中國農民銀行第三二四次會議會議次農貸額二百數十萬萬元，數字相當可觀，但時歷多時，未見實施，關於茶農茶商需款情形曾由吳覺農君在各雜誌著文呼籲，亦未見金融當局有實踐事實之表現。誠望政府及金融機關能早日公佈分配貸放茶農之確切數字，除近月間已經貸出之欵額外，其餘待放茶農茶商之貸欵頭寸，即與各地茶葉公會合作，迅即發放，以救眉急，蓋今春採茶時期，此刻菜巳屆臨，不可坐失機會，倘能及時搶救得力，不唯茶農可運振興之機會，即國計民生之復蘇與增進，期待於此者亦非淺解。</p>
<h3>在盟方編製下的日本工業</h3>
<p>— 淸和</p>
<p>自從日本宣佈投降以後，日本工業生產，幾已全部停頓，工人們都離開工業區，日用品生產雖在盟國最高統帥部的管理下，然而各廠復工的程序，仍很遲綏。</p>
<p>日本的工業本未能迅速復興適應急切的日用品需求有好幾種理由。戰時工廠，轉爲平時生產的工作，因恐與盟方禁止生產軍用品的訓令相抵觸而猶豫不前，政府未採取加緊日用品生產的步驟爲又一原因。日本工業受政府極嚴密管制，因此不敢在未得訓令前擅自復工，逍些都是日本工業遲遲始見甦醒的原因。盟方已禁止日本工廠生產特種軍用物資　，並已訓令促使各工廠保持戰時生產力，此外並令其提供詳細報告書。</p>
<p>盟方的初步工作，是激發日用品生產力以適應迫切需求。日本政府管制下的工廠，已受命儘可能生產大量除軍用以外的物資，結果大部工廠均已復工。</p>
<p>至於日本的對外貿易政策，也已經確定，所有進出口都應徵得盟軍總部同意，輸入以人民最低限度需要的物資爲限，出口亦以國內需要最低者爲限。現已着手與別國進行物物交換和商業上的進出口貿易。工廠中的零件和其他設備是不准輸出的，即出爲賠償之用，亦不能例外，已封鎖的日本金銀和外幣不准用以償付進口物資的代價。</p>
<p>過剩的物資計有：生絲四萬包，綢五百萬碼，象牙三十噸，捲烟紙四百噸。並不過剩但因他國需要而適於輸出的貨品，計有：生皮一萬噸，錫四千二百噸，橡皮一萬噸。（譯自基督敎科學箴言報）</p>
<h3>生產珍聞</h3>
<p>— 國棟</p>
<p>最近美國紡織界，有一個打破記錄的進步，就是在米而頓的吉可比紡織廠裏，裝着最新式的機器，在機器的一端放進棉花，在另一端已經織成了棉布出來了，並沒有經過紡織的工作，在那一家工廠和其他幾個相聯的廠裏，每年可以生產這樣的棉布二百萬碼。</p>
<p>在美國全國，共有錠子二千六百五十萬，但自從這方法發明以後，未見相形見絀。在吉可比廠裏，棉花放進機器之後，就可以壓成一種半吋厚四十吋闊的東西，再照着需要壓成各種不同的厚薄，再用流質的石膏印製花樣，使織維質黏住，不致分離，可以印成彩色或是沒有彩色的素色，隨心所願。</p>
<p>那一種產物最大的用途是作爲牙科用的手巾，尿布，牛奶的淸濾器，襯墊用的東西，大部份是在使用以後預備　去的，將來把使用範圍擴慶起來，更可以製成桌布，檯毯，窗帘，吸水量大爲增加，而用過以後，可以棄去，不必洗濯。</p>
<h3>正在進行中的世界銀行</h3>
<p>— 利</p>
<p>根據布里敦協定而籌設的世界銀行，具有遠大的目光，旨在保證借欵，爲一國的重建或開發資源直接貸欵，最初的大半活動將致力於修復，歐洲所受的破壞，以後將致力於發展世界自然資源和工業。</p>
<p>截至一九四五年十二月二十一日爲止，據美國財政部長文森氏宣布，各國已經同意接受的分祖金額如下：</p>
<p>美國　二十七萬萬五千萬元</p>
<p>中國　五萬萬五千萬元</p>
<p>南斯拉夫　六千萬元</p>
<p>古巴　五千萬元</p>
<p>菲律賓　一千五百萬元</p>
<p>委內瑞拉　一千五百萬元</p>
<p>阿比西尼亞六百萬元</p>
<p>厄瓜多爾　五百萬元</p>
<p>危地馬拉　五百萬元</p>
<p>共計三十四萬萬五千六百萬元。</p>
<p>此外，英國國會已批准由英國繳納十萬萬三千萬，加拿大準備繳納三萬萬元，比利時二萬萬二千五百萬，墨西哥九千萬元，哥侖比亞五千萬元。全體合計五卞四萬萬二千一百萬元，祇差二萬萬九千九百萬元就可以合成世界銀行營業所需的五十七萬萬二千萬元；一旦蘇聯·法國·印度或共他小國參加繳欵以後，無疑將超過所需的欵額。</p>
<h3>美國中學生的半工半讀制</h3>
<p>— 文</p>
<p>在美國各州，都有許多關於敎育的法律設立，凡十八歲以下的兒童都要入學讀書。也有許多區域。禁止十六歲以下的兒童工作。不過在美國大城市裏，有許多家庭太貧窮，不能讓他們的兒女一直入學讀到十八歲。有些兒童半途輟學，假報年齡去找事情做，逃避學校的法律。</p>
<p>因此學校董事會決定了，與其殷立這法律而不遵守，還不如不設的好。所以他們發起了半工半讀的學制來解次這問題。凡是要維持家庭生計而一定要工作的；及願意工作而以爲讀書並不能滿足他們需求的學生，都可以半工半　。有些城市裏半工讀的學生，定了讀書四小時，在指定的工廠要工作四小時。這學制叫做四四制。在舊金山最普遍而且很有效。</p>
<p>在紐約市半工讀的學制叫做「合作敎育」，加入的中學學生有二千名。這班學生上課一個星期，然後工作一個星期。兩個學生擔任一份工，這樣對於雇主方面算是一個長工了。大的有一百六十五個工廠是實施這個辦法的。</p>
<p>這種方法，一方面可以解次勞工的缺乏，一方面可以造就學生的出路，同時並能鍛練出一般克苦耐勞的工作人員而使一般窮苦的家庭得到經濟上的輔助，實在是可以效法的。</p>
<h3>天隆染織槪况</h3>
<p>— 史稚威</p>
<p>天隆染織廠，最初創設時爲合夥組織，在三十二年二月一日組織爲股份有限公司，資本一百萬元，同年九月，增加資本至五百萬元，三十三年八月增加資本一千五百萬元，三十四年十一月，改爲國幣二千萬元，於本年一月十八日通過改爲資本一萬萬元。最初設廠於法華鎭路，在三十二年二月盤入小沙渡路紅棉廠第二廠，日出被單四千餘條。</p>
<p>出品方面，除各色被單之外，更有線呢，條漂，開斯米等布疋，副產品有織花　布織花茶巾，除本埠各大百貨公司均有經售之外，外埠各地如溫州重慶香港等地都來採辦。</p>
<h3>迎頭趕上</h3>
<p>— 鸎</p>
<p>誰都不能否認，中國是一個工業落後的國家，和前進的國家比較起來，眞是距離得太遠了。這一次因爲戰事關係，和其他各國的生產情形，更爲隔　，在目前的國外的雜誌上，就可以看到一點關於國外生產方面的進步情形。　但是中國的工業界，絕對不能因爲距離太遠而停止前進，我們要用加倍的努力，迎頭趕上，那末即使不能和國外的工業界爭一日之短長，至少也不致於淘法了。</p>
<h3>中國工業界的當前問題</h3>
<p>— 徐百益</p>
<p>李祖範先生談工業前途</p>
<p>中國化學工業社，創始於民國元年十月，已有悠久的歷史，在中國的化學工業事業上，佔着光榮的一頁。最初是由方液仙先生獨資創設，到了民國二十三年一月改組爲股份有限公司。在這次抗戰初期，液仙光生不幸失蹤，業務由李祖範先生負責主持，應付這一個空前未有的困苦時期。祖範先生對於工業建設，有獨到的地方，早年留學美國，專攻工廠管理學，筆者特往拜訪，暢談自淪陷期問的一切情形到今後工業界的瞻望。</p>
<p>淪陷時問的苦鬥</p>
<p>中國化學工業社，因爲有狠好的基礎，逐年發展，自建廠屋，於化粧品部份以外，更進而硏製其他各種化學工業品。在民國十二年續建第二工場專製調味品，十七年更建第三工場，製造三星蚊香，劃了八一三的前夕，到了一個非常蓬勃的時期，但日本當局，對於中國的各種事業，調查得非常詳細，尤其是對於軍備方面有關係的工廠。中國化學工業社，設有油脂工場，除製造肥皂之外，並有大量的甘油，甘油是製造爆炸物的重要原料，因此在太平洋戰爭開始以後，立刻由日本油脂株式會社監督。在事前祖範先生很知道所貯大量的原料，是相當危險的，因此在未曾被他的接管之前，把大部份原料，做成製成品，這一點使日本人非常失望。在開始監督之後，社範先生抱着絕對不合作的態度，他們要收買，租用，代做，絲毫沒有考慮的餘地，直截爽快地回答了他們。因此日本油脂株式會社曾經做成秘密報告書，要求軍部嚴厲的處置。祖範先生也曾屢次被傳到軍部去。在日人監督的時代，實在是痛苦的時期，後來日本常局，實在覺得無可利用，就在三十四年三月初移交偽政府敵產管理委員會由該會發還自由營業，但對於生產方面，竭力减少，無非想渡過難關，等待勝利的來臨。</p>
<p>內地的建設</p>
<p>中國化學工業社，在抗戰開始以後，就到重慶的工業區李家沱，設立渝廠，製造各種日用品，由李祖謙先生主持。到民國二十八九年，已經規模粗具，三十年以後，已經有很好的成績。自從勝利以後，繼續開工，目前各廠紛紛停辦，在李家沱方面，祇剩了三四家工廠，中國化學工業社渝廠，就是其中之一。在抗戰期間，該社又在桂林設立分廠，但在三十三年下半年戰局變動，整個毀滅，損失極重，而職工們流離失所，更是空前的刦難。</p>
<p>今後瞻望</p>
<p>對於今後工業界的瞻望，固然不能一概而論，但大部份的工業界所遭遇到的問題，大致是相同的。在大體上，因爲抗戰以來，物資愈用愈少，已經到了枯竭的地步。在八一三到太平洋戰爭的前夕，可以說是工業界的黃金時代，物資存得很多，南洋等地更有很大的銷路，因此前途現着無限光明。但自從太平洋戰事發生以後，物資就日益枯竭，價格固然不斷上漲，但工廠的存底，日趨薄弱，祇是一種紙上富貴而已。在勝利以來，因爲交通未曾恢復，國內的物資，無法運輸，國外的物資，無法來華，要使生產擴展，實在並不容易。關於經營方面，那末有下列幾個問題，是很使目前的工業界發生煩悶的</p>
<p>（一）外貨問題：舶來品因爲大量生產的關係，售價非常便宜，因此一般國貨廠商，就有一種岌岌自危的心理，但事實上祗要遝輸能够暢通，中國廠商的原料成本减低以後，售價自然也能够减低的，所以要和舶來品競爭，輸入原料是不可避免的事實，若原料無從輸入而儘量把製成品臉入，那末中國廠商，就要遇着旣無原料，不能减低成本，同時又外遇廉價舶來品傾銷的雙重打擊。這一個問題的關鍵，在於外匯的問題，外匯率固然在幣制未曾穩定以前，一時不能公佈，但最近銀行押匯，也命令停止了，這似乎並不是一種澈底的辦法。我們旣然不能避免，終有一天要和舶來品短兵相接的時候，那末無寗早日達到那個地步，然後逐漸調整，祇要努力前進，埋頭苦幹，前途依然是光明的。</p>
<p>（二）勞工問題　勞工問題，在目前是相當嚴重的，除了生活高漲，工資必須隨時調整外，更有一個節外生枝的問題，那就是在抗戰期前解雇的職工的復工問題。市政府方面，曾有明令不必接管那種職工復工的要求，這的確是顧到工業界困難的一種賢明的措施，希望負責調解的當局，能够按照明令實行，因爲以前在解雇的時候，已經有相當辦法，現在要求復工，在情理方面講，實在說不過去。同時在技術上講，甲廠解雇的工人，不妨到乙廠去，乙廠解雇的工人，不妨到甲廠去，就可以兩全其美，如果一定堅持要回到原廠去，就發生很大的困難。</p>
<p>（三）政府政策　目前的工業界因爲政府方針，未有明白宣示，覺得徬徨歧途，例如國營和民營的問題，整個財政的問題，都是工業界希望早日有明白的規定的。並且在規定之後，要一本原意做去，並無更變，那末中國的工業界，就可以和環境配合起來，向前邁進。</p>
<p>（四）同業公會　同業公會的組織，照例應該是健全的團體，工作方面：要能够解次同業方面的一切問題，保障同業的福利，提高同業出品的標準。但目前的同業公會並不能做到那幾點，原因不外乎各廠之間互相猜忌，不肯開誠爲整個行業的前途着想，而同業公會分門別類的種類過於繁複，也是理由之一，例如中國化學工業社，同時要加入五個公會。但一般人加入公會，祇是負付淸會費的責任，其他事務，是不聞不問的，又因爲分類太多，每一個公會，沒有力量去雇用專職而有辦事幹才的職員，處理一切事務，因此同業公會，難於達到理想的境地。事實上不妨把分類儘量减少，集中起來，那末就可以聘請專家，集思廣益的硏討，一方面可以把種種建議，貢獻給政府，一方面可以力求技術方面的進步。</p>
<p>在抗戰以前，祖範先生曾在調味品業同業公會試辦技術的改進工作，設立化騐室，舉行抽查方法，凡是合格的出品，都給予一種規定的封簽，這種舉動，可以避免同業用次貨混售而使同業之間發生無謂的競爭，更可以提高整個行業在社會上的聲譽，後來很得成效。在抗戰初期祗有福州一地可通，那裏的海關，就指定要有封簽的味粉，方能進口，由此一例，就可以知道同業公會的確是事在人爲的。</p>
<p>歸納起來，今後的工業界，完全要看交通運輸，是否能够早日恢復，政府方針，是否能够統盤規定，工業界同仁，還要努力前進，迎頭趕上，那末中國的工業界，是可以達到蓬勃時代的。</p>

<h3>Marshall and Others to Depart from Chongqing to Inspect the Ceasefire Situation; Communist Northeast Army Launches Another Offensive</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Nanjing, 24th] Sources recently arriving from the Northeast report: The Communist army within the Northeast actually numbers less than 20,000 men. They are mostly transferred from the Jehol and Chahar provinces. The so-called "local Eighth Route Army" is no more than 30,000 to 40,000 men, but the original puppet Manchukuo army, aided by foreign forces in joining the Communist army and calling themselves the "People's Army," numbers as many as 100,000. The "local Eighth Route Army" has inferior weapons, while more than half of the Communist army and the puppet army have acquired Japanese equipment. The puppet army under the command of the Communist army that first came into contact with the National Army's Du Yuming's forces, however, lacks fighting spirit. If there is no foreign support, they may disintegrate.</p>
<p>[United Press Chongqing, 24th] Marshall, Enlai, and Zhang Zhizhong, members of the Military Subcommittee of the Mediation Executive Headquarters, are scheduled to depart from Chongqing for the conflict zones in the next few days to conduct inspections, extending to various areas of North China. Accompanying them will be one Chinese special envoy and four American special envoys. Their first destination is Beiping.</p>
<p>[Associated Press Beiping, 24th] According to reliable sources here: U.S. Special Envoy Marshall plans to conduct large-scale inspections throughout China, and is scheduled to arrive here from Chongqing within a day or two. Marshall's trip will take him through Zhangjiakou, Yan'an, Shenyang, and various areas of North China to inspect the implementation of the ceasefire agreement. He will then proceed to Nanjing, Shanghai, Wuhan, and Guangzhou, and return to Chongqing around March 9th. It is said that Foreign Minister Wang Shijie and Communist Party representative Zhou Enlai will accompany him.</p>
<p>[United Press Beiping, 24th] Local Chinese newspapers reported a Central News Agency dispatch stating that the Communist army in the Northeast has launched offensives "from all directions" with the aim of seizing Xinmin, 45 miles south of Shenyang, and severing the railway line connecting the National Army with that city. The dispatch stated that the Communist army simultaneously attacked six other cities in the Northeast. After two days and nights of attacking, the Communist army drove the National Army out of Xiushuihezi near Xinmin, but their offensive was repelled. The National Army then launched a counter-offensive, driving the Communist army back beyond Kangping and Faku. It is claimed that the Communist army deployed ten heavy artillery pieces and thirty field guns. It is also reported that the Communist army is attacking Panshan, Nanling, Tai'an, Liaozhong, Zhangwu, and other places, and is destroying transportation lines.</p>

<h3>Our Government Values Public Opinion; A Formal Statement Will Be Issued Regarding the Northeast Takeover; Supervisory Committee Proposes That We Not Be Bound by the Yalta Conference Decisions</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Nanjing, 24th] Chongqing News: The government is about to issue a formal statement regarding the Northeast takeover. It believes that the opinions expressed by people's organizations and public opinion organs in various places regarding the Northeast situation, as well as the marches and petitions organized by students in various places to express their views on national affairs, are a comprehensive test of the unified public opinion of the entire country after the victory, and cannot be ignored. The situation in the Northeast is becoming increasingly clear.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Chongqing, 24th] It is reported that Supervisory Committee members of the Control Yuan, Tian Mengjin, Wang Xianzhang, Ma Yaonan, Bai Rui, Li Zhengle, Jin Yufu, Wan Can, Yu Shude, etc., stated that the foreign ministers' meeting in Moscow last year by the US, UK and Soviet Union did not invite our country to participate, and after the meeting, a communique was issued involving our country's internal affairs. On the 11th of this month, Moscow, London, and Washington simultaneously announced the secret agreement signed by Luo, Qiu, and Shi at the Yalta Conference on February 11th last year. The stipulations made in its content cause our country's loss of territorial sovereignty to be even more significant than what Japan demanded during the "September 18th" Incident. This meeting did not invite our country to participate in advance, nor was our country informed in advance when the secret agreement was negotiated. Such measures are unacceptable to any independent country, and it is regrettable that they were imposed on an allied country. Although our countrymen should be sincerely grateful to all Allied nations for their assistance in resisting the enemy, no Allied nation has the right to use the fact that they helped us fight for independence and freedom as an excuse to deprive and infringe upon our country's independence and freedom. Looking at the current situation, we cannot afford to compromise or delay. Therefore, a proposal is submitted, requesting the Executive Yuan to order the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to issue a solemn statement immediately: "Our country will not be bound by any decisions made at any international conference in which our country did not participate, that may affect our country, and we will refuse to agree to and consider them, in order to correct public opinion and eliminate hidden dangers." After receiving the report, the Control Yuan has reviewed it and forwarded it to the Executive Yuan for implementation.</p>
<h3>Youth Party Opinions</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Chongqing, 24th] The Chinese Youth Party issued an opinion on the Northeast issue, stating: The Northeast is Chinese territory, and all friendly nations must recognize this and respect China's territorial sovereignty and integrity in the Northeast. China's nationals absolutely do not recognize any agreements related to China that have not been agreed upon by China. China and the Soviet Union must strengthen mutual respect and understanding on the basis of the Treaty of Friendship and Alliance. We should fully use diplomatic channels to resolve the outstanding issues between China and the Soviet Union in order to enhance the friendship between the two countries and ensure that peace in the Far East is effectively guaranteed. The internal affairs part of the Northeast issue must be separated from the diplomatic issues, and a reasonable solution should be sought in the spirit of coordination.</p>

<h3>Truth Revealed About the East Mongolia Issue; Requesting Autonomy from the Government; Delegation Arrives in Beiping to Meet Xiong Shihui for Discussions</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Beiping, 23rd] After the Mongolian representatives arrived in Beiping, Xiong Shihui met with the seven members of the Mani Badala group at his private residence in the form of receiving an ordinary citizen, and hosted a banquet. According to well-informed sources, the authorities expressed suspicion about their ability to convene a people's congress with free will in the Soviet garrison area, and their ability to reach Changchun from Mongolia in a calm manner amidst the chaos. The authorities also stated that the implementation of autonomy is a unanimous demand of various regions in the country, and is clearly stated in the Prime Minister's legacy, but the degree should be consistent, and there is no distinction between high, medium, and low. As for supporting weak ethnic groups, none of our five ethnic groups is currently strong, and all are weak. We should unite closely and seek wealth and strength together. As for the autonomy demands made by the East Mongolia representatives, it is currently impossible to answer and resolve them, because the Soviet army has not yet withdrawn from these areas and allowed us to take over. The East Mongolia delegation originally planned to go to Chongqing, but whether they can make the trip depends on the situation in Beiping.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Beiping, 23rd] The arrival of the East Mongolia representatives has confirmed that the East Mongolia issue is not as serious as previously reported, but the entire Inner Mongolia autonomy issue will be revived. The East Mongolia delegation, headed by Mani Badala, stated here that although the East Mongolia Autonomous Government has been established, the East Mongolia Autonomous Republic has not been established. Their purpose in coming south is to request autonomy from the government, and there is no intention to harm national unity. The East Mongolia Autonomous Government was organized to meet temporary needs. If the Inner Mongolia autonomy issue is resolved as a whole, the separate East Mongolia autonomous institutions can also be abolished. Their proposition has had a considerable impact on Mongolian people in the old capital. The Inner Mongolia autonomy, which was widely publicized in 1933, has almost become a topic of discussion among Mongolians again.</p>
<p>At 4:00 PM on the 23rd, more than 100 Mongolian expatriates in Beiping welcomed the East Mongolia delegation at the Lai Jin Yu Xuan in Central Park. Members of the Central Committee Bai Yunti, Member of the Legislative Yuan Wu Yunpeng, Director of the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission's Beiping Office He Zhaolin, and Mongolian people in political circles also participated. The Chief Representative of the East Mongolia Delegation, Mani Badala, said in an impromptu speech that their autonomous institutions were established due to local needs in the midst of war and chaos. The Soviet side did not provide assistance or interfere. The Communist army is very close to the autonomous region, but did not enter the region or interfere in the affairs of the Mongolian banner. They support the Three People's Principles of supporting and assisting weak ethnic groups. Other doctrines are not followed by the Mongolian people. They hope that the central government will make a unified resolution on the Inner Mongolia issue based on the late Prime Minister's legacy of assisting weak ethnic groups. The reason why they established the East Mongolia Autonomous Government and represented East Mongolia's request for autonomy is not to split Inner Mongolia, but because they are eager to solve the problem that the Western Mongols are in deep water and have not been able to contact the Western Mongols due to traffic obstruction, and have not obtained the consent of the Western Mongols, so everything is only called East Mongolia. He described the birth of the East Mongolia autonomous institutions, saying that after August 15th, the army passed through, bandits rose up, and local order was not peaceful. The public security maintenance association was thus established. After the association was established, it immediately abolished all the harmful policies of the puppet Manchukuo, and suppressed bandits. Large numbers of bandits with more than 50 people can no longer gain a foothold. Soldiers and civil servants throughout the territory are working for the benefit and happiness of the whole, working diligently without pay and fulfilling their obligations. More than 10,000 students in secondary and higher schools are running in both areas, conveying news and assisting in the implementation of government orders, which is very meritorious. Speaking of the people's congress in the area, he said that many representatives of each banner came from remote areas and took more than a month to arrive. They often camped overnight in the wilderness of ice and snow. Mani Badala did not praise the discipline of the Soviet army, saying that there are nearly one million troops in the Soviet army, with few officers and many soldiers, making it difficult to restrain them, and military discipline is lax. As far as he knows, the property of the Mongolian people in Bintu Banner of Jerim League has been lost by a quarter. Later, when he arrived in Shenyang, he found that the losses in Bintu Banner were still minor. Therefore, the lives of Mongolian people today have become a big problem. Mani's Mongolian speech was elegant, meticulous, and inflammatory. In his closing remarks, he said that we in the remote East Mongolia miss you very much. Today, we can gather together with you and see so many pillars of outstanding youth. I am sincerely excited and sad, and I burst into tears at the end of my speech, and the whole audience was moved to tears. Before Mani's speech, Wang Ziyang, a representative of the Beiping Mongolian fellow villagers and a former member of the National Assembly, gave a welcome speech, also emphasizing autonomy as the unanimous demand of the Mongolian people.</p>

The purpose of MacArthur's Headquarters in dissolving the zaibatsu is to dissolve large enterprises in industry, commerce, agriculture, and finance, remove the mutual relations of bad companies, so that the profits obtained can be more widely distributed, and make production and transactions open for the general benefit, so as to help the development of Japan's peaceful and democratic system. As for the specific measures to dissolve the zaibatsu, first remove the feudal color of the zaibatsu, decompose their monopoly organizations, and redistribute wealth. The instruction to dissolve the Mitsui, Mitsubishi, Sumitomo, and Yasuda four major zaibatsu will be promulgated, and as a result, these zaibatsu will have to transfer all their shares to the newly established Zaibatsu Reorganization Committee, and their production equipment will be managed by other production companies. Currently, there are more than 400 companies whose assets are prohibited from being moved by the headquarters. In addition, Oji Paper Company and its branches will also be included in the list.</p>

<h3>Using Radar to Explore Space; It Only Takes a Few Seconds to Travel Back and Forth Between Earth and Mars</h3>
<p>[Associated Press Washington 23rd Dispatch] The Army Signal Corps engineers are now using radar to explore the solar system. They believe that controlling a space-free spacecraft with radar will allow them to fly in the space between planets and use electrons to explore the conditions on other planets. They first proved that ultra-high-frequency radio waves can pass through the ionosphere, which ordinary radio waves cannot pass through, by transmitting ultra-high-frequency radio waves to the moon. That is, the electrified area outside the Earth's atmosphere. They hope that the second experiment will use radar to contact one of the planets, possibly Mars. The speed of radar is 186,000 miles per second, and the round trip from Earth to Mars takes about six and a quarter minutes. The Signal Corps scientists first contacted the moon, which is 256,857 miles from Earth, on January 10 this year, and the round trip of radio waves took two and a half seconds.</p>

<p>[United Press, Manila, 23rd] While 10,000 defeated soldiers of "Tiger of Malaya" Yamashita Tomoyuki were sleeping in Camp No. 1 in Luzon this morning, Yamashita was moved out of his cell and taken to the execution ground in great secrecy and quiet, for fear of disturbing the prisoners or causing demonstrations. The official executioner was only notified a short time before the execution and ordered to keep it secret. No reporters or photographers were present at the scene of the execution. After Yamashita's body was taken down from the gallows, it was sewn into a canvas and driven to a desolate grave to be buried with the soldiers.

<p>The three traitors, Chen Gongbo, Chu Minyi, and Chen Bi-jun, were escorted to Suzhou on the 17th of this month and sent to the detention center of the Higher Procuratorate on Sizhi Street for detention. The traitor Chen Gongbo, bored in detention, spends his days reading the novel "Peng Gong An" to kill time, while the traitor Chu Minyi practices Tai Chi every day. Wang Jingwei's two daughters from his second wife took a night express train from Nanjing to Suzhou and rushed to the detention center on Sizhi Street at about 7:00 this morning to visit their mother, Chen Bi-jun. However, the head of the detention center refused their request on the grounds that he had been instructed that the three traitors Chen and others were not allowed to meet with anyone. Despite repeated pleading, it was not allowed. Helpless, the two daughters stood in front of the detention center, sobbing for a long time, and then turned back to the station to take the train away.</p>

<p>Cloth Merchant Robbed and Killed</p>
<p>Chen Hongcai, a villager from Chenjia Village in Sanguanzhen, Dongwai, and Fei Wenquan and others from the village, sold cloth to Jijiashi in Jingjiang, obtaining a large sum of money. They stayed at the Huibin Hotel there. Qin Xingren, Fang Yaowen, and Fei Xiangbao from Feijiacun in Qinjingqiao, who were also selling cotton cloth in Jijiashi, were addicted to gambling and lost all their money. They were greedy for money and on the 20th of last month, they lured Chen Hongcai to the wilderness, beat him to death with a shoulder pole, and abandoned his body in the river. They returned to Cheng with the money. His father, Chen Zhouquan, had not returned home for a long time, so on the 4th of this month, he went to Jiangbei to inquire and learned the cause of his son's death. He also picked up a hat belonging to Qin Xinglin and a shoe belonging to Fei Xiangbao, and retrieved his son's body, transported it to his home in Jiangyin, and reported it to the county government. On the 16th, the case was investigated by trial judge Zhu and the evidence was confirmed. The three Qins were detained and interrogated, and all admitted to being accomplices.

<p>Nanchang</p>
<p>Expediting the Transportation of Jiangxi Grain to Supply Nanjing and Shanghai</p>
<p>This province was ordered by the Central Government in October of last year to purchase 2 million dan of rice and transport it to Nanjing and Shanghai. It is found that this province collects and purchases nearly 10 million shi dan every year. The actual physical objects left over from previous years amount to 3 million dan. However, the directors of the grain warehouses in various counties and the rice processing plants colluded with each other and embezzled everything. The 3 million zu numbers remaining in the provincial grain office have now been allocated to more than 20 counties such as Fengcheng in the lower reaches of the Gan River and Fu River. It was initially planned to deliver 1 million dan by the end of last year. However, due to soaring grain prices in various places, the number of purchases made by the people of each county on their own was less than 1% of what was expected. The Ministry of Food has specially dispatched Jianren Commissioner Li Jikua to the province to supervise and expedite the transportation, preparing to transport 200,000 zu of grain this month to supply Nanjing and Shanghai. In addition to establishing a transportation station in Jiujiang, 16 shallow-water boats have been allocated to Jiangxi to strengthen transportation work.</p>

<h3>An Ancient City Will Become the National Center; Lanzhou Greets Peace with Drumbeats</h3>
<p>— This Newspaper's Flight Report, Chen Qian from Lanzhou</p>
<p>Youths Aspire to the Frontier, "China's Destiny"</p>
<p>If you say this is the frontier, then let me ask you: If Outer Mongolia had not become independent and Tibet had returned to our national territory, where would the center of the country be?</p>
<p>I can answer: Lanzhou. Of course, everyone knows that this place is different from the interior because of "inconvenient transportation and cultural isolation." This is an undeniable fact. However, during the War of Resistance, this small frontier town also did its best, not losing its local importance.</p>
<p>Speaking of which, it's a repetition of what was said before. It was the period when we fought alongside the Allies, especially in 1938 and 1939. Although the Soviet Union had not yet joined the holy war against aggression, it continued to supply us with weapons and dispatch military officers to China to assist us. So at this time, Lanzhou, the whole city, was also infected with the atmosphere of fire. To this day, the locals all say that on the second day of the first lunar month of 1939, our air force "gave the aggressors a beating" here and completed a glorious strategy. The enemy planes flew here from Yuncheng through the skies of Shaanxi, of course with their intentions, but we were also well prepared, giving them a head-on blow. Under the superb skills of our anti-aircraft gunners, nine planes were shot down in one day.</p>
<p>Pulling a Cartload of Banknotes, You Can Walk Slowly on the Street</p>
<p>Two days later, on the fifth day of the first lunar month, six more planes were shot down. Everyone said it was a joyful year. Perhaps it was a gift from the Japanese invaders. Now, some of the spoils of war are still on display in the National Defense Exhibition Room of the Public Education Center, stained with blood. When visitors see them, they all have a slight smile of victory on their faces.</p>
<p>General Zhu Yimin and Mr. Gu Zhenglun served here as the military and administrative chiefs respectively. General Zhu Yimin has been stationed here for many years. Under the combination of firmness and gentleness, he gets along well with the two chairmen of the neighboring provinces, Ma Hongda and Ma Bufang. Perhaps it is because there are so many Muslims with the surname Ma that they get along better with General Zhu. As for Mr. Gu, everyone knows that he was once the commander of the Military Police. Don't think he is already a little old. In fact, as chairman and commander of security, he is known as "the gate of the city of opium." Now, it is a place where the suppression of opium is very strict. Here, you can safely pull a cartload of banknotes and walk slowly on the street.</p>
<p>The Ice Season at the Bridge; Donkey Carts and Wheeltracks Never Cease</p>
<p>The Yellow River Iron Bridge is one of the three major iron bridges in the country. It is the essential road for highway traffic to Xinjiang, Qinghai, and Ningxia. Pedestrians on the bridge can see the scenery on the north and south banks, as if they have entered a strange realm. When the waves hit the bridge stones, there is a rustling sound, like being on a boat. But now you can't hear the sound of the water, and people can walk under the bridge, because the river has frozen. Every year at this time, the sounds of donkey carts and wheels never cease in the heart of the river. Not only do laborers get a convenient path, but fashionable young men and women also bring ice skates here to enjoy their youthful pleasure - a natural ice rink. However, after the beginning of spring, the river ice will soon melt. The security authorities have banned pedestrians, and the Yellow River will roar again. When the water flows, you can't see the shadows of boats, only those primitive sheep and cow skins split into rafts, flowing down the river, and the artistic conception of "Fisherman's Song" emerges more naturally.</p>
<p>Special Buildings; Called "Three Small and Three Big"</p>
<p>The architecture here is very special. There are city gates, and there is another pass, but the pass is bigger than the city, so Lanzhou is called the "Three Small and Three Big." That is, the city is small and the pass is big, the car is small and the wheel is big, the house is small and the pit is big. There is a Wowo Bridge in Xiguan, (握橋), which is a wooden bridge. It is truly an old building of "long bridge lying on the waves." The new-style buildings include the Martyrs' Shrine, (established with the support of Chairman Gu,) modeled after the Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum in Nanjing, and constructed very well. There is also the Northwest Building, (initiated by Director He of the former Northwest Highway Bureau,) for the purpose of entertaining Chinese and foreign dignitaries. The Nine-Room Building (Chairman's official residence), the Museum of Products (built by the city government), and the rest are mostly private villas, concentrated in Dashanlin New Village, which are relatively crude, but much better than the mountain cave dwellings (the homes of the poor). In terms of traces, most of them are administrative organs or military offices, which cannot be "looked at closely," so they cannot be "talked about in detail."</p>
<p>This is a summer resort, with good cantaloupe and a good climate. Fat people can sweat less here, and thin people can get stronger. When the autumn wind rises, eating a bowl of mutton soup steamed bun will definitely increase your heat. In winter, frozen soft pears and fresh lilies are fine snacks to enjoy around the stove. Speaking of spring, peaches bloom all over the land in March. There is the most spring scenery in the suburbs ten miles away, and going out to enjoy the flowers is all for the sake of the peach blossoms. This is as lively as the people of Shanghai vying to see the peach blossoms in Longhua.</p>
<p>Watching Peach Blossoms in the Spring Suburbs</p>
<p>Wildly Beating the Peace Drum on New Year's Day</p>
<p>Now spring has arrived again, and who are the peach blossoms blooming for? You take a car, I walk, you for the flowers, I also for the flowers.</p>
<p>During the Lunar New Year, this place is extremely "lively." The first thing that strongly expresses the local color is the "Shehuo," among which the "Taiping Drum" is the most brilliant. Each Shehuo has a dozen drummers, playing very loud drums, and everyone is moved by this Taiping Drum. For eight years of the War of Resistance, it has been playing every year, and this year it is still continuing to play. Play on! Play louder. - Hoping to beat out true peace.</p>
<p>If you say Shanghai is a "dynamic" city, then I say Lanzhou is a "quiet" city. She is as quiet as a virgin, standing gracefully, why doesn't everyone feel compassion for her "loyalty"? I call for her. I share Mr. Chiang's sentence in "China's Destiny" that "youths aspire to the frontier," especially since this frontier is also the center of the country?

<h3>Our Protest Against the Yalta Secret Agreement</h3>
<p>On February 11, 1946, Washington, London, and Moscow simultaneously announced the secret agreement reached on the same day of the previous year at the Yalta Conference by Roosevelt, Churchill, and Stalin. This included recognizing the independence of Outer Mongolia, joint Sino-Soviet management of the Middle Eastern and Southern Manchurian railways, and leasing the ports of Dalian and Lushun, as the price for the Soviet Union declaring war on Japan three months after Germany's surrender. China, in the war against aggression, had the longest period of resistance and suffered the most damage. Unexpectedly, the United States, the Soviet Union, and Great Britain concluded such a secret agreement, infringing upon the territorial sovereignty of their ally, China, and violating the solemn promise of respecting China's territorial sovereignty from the Washington Nine-Power Treaty to the Cairo Conference. This secret agreement violated the ideal and goal of the United Nations' joint combat, created a bad precedent for power politics and secret diplomacy in the future, and its impact was sufficient to undermine world peace in the future, repeating the sins of humanity. This secret agreement is truly the most unethical record in modern diplomatic history.</p>
<p>The Yalta Conference was convened after China's defeats in the Central Plains and Xiang-Gui campaigns, and before the success of the atomic bomb. Roosevelt, under the pressure of fighting on two fronts, was eager to ask the Soviet Union to declare war on Japan. We can understand his situation. However, disregarding morality and violating his conscience, he agreed to the Soviet Union's demands and infringed upon China's territorial sovereignty, which is absolutely unforgivable. Roosevelt and the United States he led originally occupied an extremely friendly position in the hearts of the Chinese people, but this position has been greatly damaged by the Yalta Secret Agreement. We absolutely cannot pardon his faults and responsibilities this time because of Roosevelt's contributions to the entire war and his past concern and assistance to China.</p>
<p>Since the September 18th Incident, Britain has always lacked fair and effective assistance to China's resistance against Japan, and even once blockaded China's only international transportation route in order to seek compromise with Japan. This attitude has long been unfair. Before the Yalta Conference, Churchill deliberately exaggerated Britain's aid to China. He despised China's contribution to this war and the position it should occupy. At the Yalta Conference, he clearly betrayed his ally China for Britain, which is a completely dishonorable act.</p>
<p>The Soviet Union's demands at the Yalta Conference completely violated the purpose of jointly fighting against aggressive fascist countries. It violated the new foundation of Sino-Soviet friendship jointly built by Mr. Lenin and Mr. Sun Yat-sen. It violated the Soviet Union's many foreign declarations, especially the declaration to China that it would abandon the unequal treaties of the Tsarist era. It violated the spirit of various important documents since the Atlantic Charter. What the Soviet Union advocates is to overthrow imperialism, so how can the Soviet Union's demand today to restore its "rights of the Russian Empire" explain itself? The Soviet Union took advantage of others' difficulties to make such demands, how is this different from Tsarist Russia's behavior towards China? This kind of behavior will inevitably create factors for future wars in the world. For China and for the world, we have to raise a severe protest.</p>
<p>We believe that this Yalta Secret Agreement is the most unethical and dishonorable document in this war; it nullifies the sanctity of the Allied countries' participation in the war against aggression. The United States, the Soviet Union, and Great Britain should, in accordance with the spirit of the Cairo Declaration and the Moscow Four-Power Declaration, bravely and frankly admit the mistakes the three countries have committed against China. The Soviet Union should especially voluntarily abandon its Tsarist-era policies in order to demonstrate the international justice it has always advocated. The Chinese government should make this issue and the recent shocking developments in the Northeast fully public; demand a United Nations investigation to prevent any similar secret diplomacy in the future, and to avoid the Northeast from becoming a factor in another world war. Regarding the current situation, the Chinese government, except under the condition that the Soviet Union equally fulfills its treaty obligations, shall not have any behavior that loses national sovereignty and interests in fulfilling its obligations under the Sino-Soviet Treaty it has signed. We hope that the whole country, regardless of party affiliation, will unite as one, supervise the government, urge the government to strive for China's equal status in the international community, and the integrity of its sovereignty, territory, and administration.</p>

<h3>My Humble Opinion on Salt Administration Reform (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Xu Erxin</p>
<p>As the purchase, transportation, and sales are exclusively managed by the National Salt Corporation, the salt administration authorities naturally hold a position of supervision and guidance over all business activities of the company. However, the salt administration authorities also have their own responsible matters that urgently need to be addressed to facilitate the company's operations and achieve success. The important ones are as follows:</p>
<p>Organizing Field Production</p>
<p>The foundation of salt administration should be the organization of field production. Regardless of whether a field tax system or a monopoly system is adopted, effective, strict, and efficient management of the salt fields is necessary to prevent leakage of production from private fields. The items for organizing field production are: (1) Salt households and stoves must all be registered. All salt pans, wells, and production methods and tools must be clearly investigated. Production is only allowed after approval and permission. (2) Carry out road construction and river dredging projects in salt-producing areas to facilitate the transportation of salt to warehouses. (3) Register the boats and vehicles used to transport salt to the warehouses. (4) Seal off and abolish scattered fields with low salt production, weak brine, and high costs. (5) Appropriately merge field areas where the situation has changed or management is inconvenient. (6) Promote and improve production methods, and establish model salt production fields. (7) Keep detailed records of the weather in production areas. (8) Compile household registers and establish Baojia for salt households and stoves. (9) Inspect production. (10) Inspect salt quality.</p>
<p>Building Warehouses</p>
<p>Warehouses must be uniformly built in each salt field, and the amount and volume should be determined based on production volume and transportation conditions. Centralized construction should be the principle, but should be built in sections based on the field production situation (Fujian fields have no salt ditches and can only be built on mounds). This is to facilitate salt households to store the produced salt in warehouses. The original privately built warehouses should be purchased or leased by the government at a given price. Large-scale official warehouses should also be built in important transportation hubs and sales gathering places in various provinces, such as Hankou Xindi on the Hubei side, Yueyang Changsha Hengyang on the Hunan side, Jiujiang Hukou on the west bank, and Wuhu Datong on the Anhui side, which have already been planned for construction. If there was damage during the Anti-Japanese War, it should be repaired urgently. Other provinces should also select locations and build them as soon as possible. The salt stored in these salt warehouses is mostly transferred to various places for distribution and sale, such as the transfer warehouses in the Song Dynasty. At least one to several storage warehouses should be built in each county and city in the sales area, and the capacity should be sufficient to cover local sales for at least three to six months. A portion of it should also include the nature of the Ever-Normal Granary to be stored regularly for years of poor production, water shortages, temporary insufficient supply, or days of war and disaster, for preparation. (According to the Song Dynasty Yuanfeng era, remote areas had to prepare for two or three years, the next remote one to two years, and the nearest half a year and a year, called reserve salt. During the Shaosheng era, the old system was used, with extensive preparation, and the transportation envoy was responsible for transportation, even to the amount of the Yuanfeng preparation. It can be seen that the accumulation of warehouse salt in various places was already valued in the Song Dynasty.) When the construction of warehouses is complete, smuggling can be prevented in terms of field production, and supply and demand can be adjusted and prices balanced in the sales area. The wholesalers of the intermediary exploitation class will have no room for existence, and private hoarding will have nothing to sell. (To be continued)</p>

<p>(23) When the National Representatives Council submits the proposals for appointment and dismissal in the first and second paragraphs of the preceding article, or the requests in paragraphs 6 to 8 of the first paragraph of the same article to the National Assembly, it shall attach a detailed statement of reasons and the relevant Yuan's defense statement.

<p>The above proposals may also be submitted during the adjournment of the National Representatives Council; however, when the Legislative Yuan deems that it is a resolution of an emergency nature, the National Representatives Council shall immediately convene an extraordinary session to be reviewed.</p>
<p>Comparing the above design with the original text of the May 5th Draft Constitution, it has many characteristics, which are described separately below:</p>
<p>1.  The powers of the National Representatives Council and the National Assembly specified in this design are strictly limited to the scope of the four powers of government and have their own boundaries, so there is no abuse of confusion.</p>
<p>2.  The number of National Representatives specified in the draft constitution is at most about 3,000. In this design, the number of councilors in each county and city is calculated at 50 people per group, so there should be at least 100,000 people. It is more "democratic" for more than 100,000 people to decide on national policies than a gathering of 3,000 people.</p>
<p>3.  The councilors of each county and city already have a concrete collegiate organization, so although the number of voters is large, they will not be uncoordinated and overly scattered; and before each voting case, the council may conduct public discussions on the reasons for both sides, so the possibility of secret activities is less likely to occur.</p>
<p>4.  Tangible systems are easily manipulated and used by ambitious people. In this design, the various powers of approval are not in the tangible National Representatives Council, and even the right to elect is divided into two parts. Since the right to vote is dispersed throughout the country, such abuses will be greatly reduced.</p>
<p>5.  The number of National Representatives in the Council is suitable for gathering and discussion, so it is easier than the 3,000 people in the draft.</p>
<p>6.  National Representatives are temporarily elected by the councils of each county and city, which can avoid the trouble and expense of direct elections, and have the convenience of launching a recall of representatives at any time. The National Representatives each have a permanent agency to supervise them, so they will not act recklessly and unjustly.</p>
<p>7.  The National Representatives Council meets twice a year, and the session can be freely extended, and half of its members are re-elected each year, which is enough to establish a close supervisory relationship between the Council and the central government, so that they will not be isolated from each other.</p>
<p>8.  The National Representatives Council is an auxiliary body of the National Assembly, not a body that generally exercises administrative power. The final decision-making power for all major cases still rests with the Assembly itself; therefore, National Representatives cannot abuse their power and act arbitrarily, like members of ordinary representative bodies.</p>
<p>9.  Although the National Representatives Council has the power to supervise or control the central government, it has no power to directly command appointments and dismissals. Each Yuan may still express protests against the Council's deliberations. Therefore, it is fundamentally different from the existing National Defense Supreme Council and the past Central Political Council, and there is no danger of merging the five powers and forming a supreme government.</p>
<p>10. The National Representatives Council is also responsible to the National Assembly, and if its proposals are not accepted by the Assembly, it must be dissolved and reorganized; therefore, the Council must uphold justice and will not lightly initiate incidents that endanger itself.</p>
<p>11. Disputes between the five powers of government in their operation are difficult to avoid. The President specified in the draft may convene a meeting of the heads of the five Yuan for consultation (Article 45), which is not a fixed body with decision-making power; and the method of establishing a special permanent agency has the danger of forming a supreme government, so it is difficult to implement. The establishment of the National Representatives Council in this design has the advantages of a permanent agency, but without its shortcomings.</p>
<p>The principles for amending the draft constitution determined by the Political Consultative Conference, on the one hand, make the National Assembly an intangible organization, and on the other hand, make the Legislative and Control Yuan similar to a bicameral parliament, and order the Executive Yuan to be responsible to the Legislative Yuan. This is a contradiction with the theory of the five-power constitution. If the above design is adopted, the central political system should still be based on the draft constitution and be studied.

Whether the US government will send another part of the American troops to China to replace them is still unknown.</p>
<h3>More Than 2,700 Ships Received Nationwide</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, China's receiving of enemy and puppet ships has been carried out for nearly four months, and it is now gradually coming to an end.

As for the loss of Chinese ships during the Anti-Japanese War, Hunan and Hubei provinces suffered the greatest losses. The Navigation Administration Bureau requested the Ministry of Communications to forward it to the Executive Yuan for approval. The Four Banks Joint Office will lend 497.81 million yuan to salvage and repair sunken ships in the Xiang-E area. In addition, larger ships that sank in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River were also requested to be salvaged and repaired, which is still under approval. It is also reported that the Yangtze River District Navigation Administration Bureau is in charge of the navigation affairs of all the Yangtze River and its tributaries in the six provinces of Sichuan, Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, Anhui, and Jiangsu. The bureau has set up offices in major ports of the four provinces of Sichuan, Hubei, Hunan, and Jiangxi. Anhui and Jiangsu provinces will take over on the first day of next month, and offices will be established in Wuhu, Nanjing, and Zhenjiang.</p>

<h3>Enemy and Puppet Regime Forcibly Seized Civilian Land; Citizens Can Request Return from Authorities</h3>
<p>During the period when the enemy and puppet regime occupied this city, in order to construct airfields and other military facilities, the enemy forcibly seized over 100,000 acres of civilian land in the suburbs of this city, such as Jiangwan, Wusong, Hongqiao, and Dachang. Furthermore, all houses within the designated areas were required to be demolished without any compensation. The victimized farmers were forced to endure this under the tyrannical power at the time, with no avenue for appeal. It is now learned that the Municipal Land Administration Bureau, in order to protect the rights and interests of the people, has stipulated that all lands forcibly seized by the enemy should be returned if their actual usage value is not required. Therefore, citizens can bring their certificates directly to the bureau to apply. After verification by the bureau, it will be forwarded to the relevant departments for return.</p>

<h3>Second Round of Subsidized Cooking Oil Likely to Be Sold Soon</h3>
<p>As of yesterday, it was not yet completely certain whether the second round of subsidized cooking oil could be sold within the next few days. According to sources from the Grain, Oil, Bean, and Cake Trade Association, the repeated delays in the sale are due to various difficulties encountered during the collection of goods, which hindered the sales date. Currently, the collection procedures have been largely completed. If no further accidents occur in these procedures today, then sales may begin as soon as tomorrow. The total amount of cooking oil for this subsidized sale is 4,400 piculs (市担), distributed among 120 businesses, with the following prices: soybean oil at 330 yuan, raw oil at 310 yuan, rapeseed oil at 300 yuan, and sesame oil at 280 yuan.

<h3>Blood Under the Wheels</h3>
<p>Vehicle Accidents Occur in Nanshi and Hongkou</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Li Guoqiang, a merchant residing at No. 161 Shangwen Lane, Xiaoximen, Nanshi, was walking along Penglai Road at around 7 p.m. yesterday when he was suddenly struck by an American Jeep (license plate number 4126), crushing his eyes and face. He was subsequently taken to Gongji Hospital for treatment in an ambulance by American military police.</p>
<p>At the intersection of Broadway and Yuanfang Road in Hongkou, at 3:15 p.m. yesterday, an army truck carrying rice passed through the area when Tian Qin Haiyun was hit by Tram No. 99, causing severe chest injuries. Local police arrived and detained the person responsible for the accident for interrogation at the precinct station. The injured person was sent to the hospital.</p>
<h3>Nanshi Police Fight Against Robbers</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] At around 10 p.m. last night, four robbers broke into the home of Liu Wenxue (brick and tile business), a local resident at No. 104 Fengji Wharf, Dongjiadu, Nanshi. Three of the robbers were armed. They were about to steal a gold bracelet, a gold ring, a Parker fountain pen, and 25,000 yuan in legal currency when, fortunately, the nearby Dongjiadu Police Station had received a report and dispatched police to surround and arrest them. The robbers immediately fired three shots to resist arrest, and the police officers returned fire with four or five shots. As a result, one robber was shot in the leg and fell to the ground, while the remaining robbers managed to escape.</p>
<h3>Large Quantity of Railway Equipment Arrives in This City for Centralized Distribution; Two Thousand Passenger Cars En Route to China</h3>
<p>The United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) has already shipped more than 60 locomotives and 700 freight cars to our country. A portion has been unloaded in Kowloon, while the remainder is being concentrated in this city for centralized distribution by the Ministry of Communications. It is also learned that over 2,000 passenger cars are en route to China. In addition, a large quantity of steel rails and railway materials will also be successively shipped. Once this batch of materials arrives, the transportation situation and railway conditions in our country should be rapidly improved. According to estimates from relevant parties, 1.4 million metric tons of transportation equipment need to be imported from abroad to repair the major transportation lines within the country. However, based on the extent of the damage caused by the enemy, even this number cannot restore conditions to pre-war standards, which shows the severe damage suffered by China's transportation infrastructure during the war.</p>
<h3>Robbery at Tianyi Dyeing and Weaving Factory; Stolen Goods Fenced in Hotel; Recognized and Large Quantity of Cloth Recovered; Multiple People Arrested</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] At around 6:30 p.m. on the 13th of this month, four bandits, one armed, entered the warehouse of the Tianyi Dyeing and Weaving Factory at No. 537 South Suzhou Road. They first tied up the warehouse guards, Xu Yuankui, Zhao Xiasheng, and Zhu Ruhuan, with hemp ropes, pushed them onto the bed in the bedroom, and locked the door. Then, they parked a previously hired rubber-wheeled cart at the entrance of the warehouse, looted 125 bolts of Chang Le brand An An blue cloth from the factory, loaded them onto the cart, and fled with the stolen goods towards Beijing Road and Shanxi Road. After Zhu Ruhuan and the others struggled free from their ropes, they reported the situation to the factory's distribution office at No. 10, Lane 284, Ningbo Road. The loss report was then filed, and the Municipal Police Bureau was notified, which ordered the Huangpu Branch to conduct a strict investigation and solve the case within ten days. After accepting the assignment, the Huangpu Branch Chief instructed the Judicial Section to handle the matter. A tip was received the day before yesterday that a large batch of cloth was being traded at No. 309, Andong Hotel, Daxin Street, Hubei Road. The head of the Judicial Section, Zhou Guanghui, led police officers to the scene and arrested a suspect, Chen Junfeng, a Shandong native, who admitted that his friend Sun Guangda (resident of No. 111, Xinmatou, Nanshi) had asked him to sell the cloth on his behalf. They then went to arrest Sun, who confessed that his younger brother, Si Lin, (resident of No. 72, Fuxin Lane, Fukang Road, Xinzha Road) had brought it to him and asked him to sell it. They then went to the address and arrested him as well. Under interrogation, they confessed that the cloth was stolen from the Tianyi Dyeing and Weaving Factory. He said that he had initiated the plan and discussed it with accomplices Nie Renjie and others. They had opened a room at No. 58, Heming Hotel, Qinghe Lane, and some of the cloth was hidden at the home of Xia Jinlong at No. 137, Xinmatou. Several accomplices were hiding in shacks in the Yangjiadu area of Pudong. At 4:30 a.m. yesterday, patrol officers Yao Hongzhang, police chiefs Chuan Lianfeng, and police officers Shi Debiao and Dong Haishen went to the above-mentioned locations and arrested the bandits Zhu Changxing, Hao Zhuhai, Nie Renjie, and Li Buji, and found a pistol, three bullets, part of the stolen goods, and stolen money at the home of Mao A Jin. All were taken to the precinct for investigation and then transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office for prosecution.</p>
<h3>Telecommunications Labor Strike Reaches Stalemate</h3>
<p>Still Unresolved as of Last Night</p>
<p>The labor strike at the Ministry of Communications Telecommunications Bureau and International Radio Station continued until last night without any improvement. It is reported that the Bureau and Station sympathize greatly with the difficult living conditions of all employees. However, due to financial constraints, they were unable to fully meet the employees' demands. The employees, however, insisted on treatment equal to that of the Four Banks and One Bureau and were unwilling to return to work. Therefore, the measures previously drafted by the Bureau and Station authorities by the employee representatives were still not accepted. According to the latest news, Director Yu, Deputy Director Lu, and Chief Engineer Lu still convened the heads of various departments at the Bureau at 7:00 p.m. last night and sincerely tried to resolve the issue, persuading employees to consider the importance of telecommunications and not to persist in their demands in order to break the stalemate. Unfortunately, due to the economic constraints of the Bureau and the persistence of the employees' demands, little progress was made.</p>
<p>Eleven Western-style restaurants and cafes went on strike last Saturday afternoon, presenting six demands, and the two sides have been unable to reach an agreement. This morning, the Guangming Cafe, Shanghai Western Restaurant, and Sevina also joined the strike.</p>
<p>The employees of the Great New Company also made demands because their adjusted wages were still insufficient to support their families, demanding a minimum salary of 116,000 yuan, and setting a deadline for the company to respond today.</p>
<p>Over two thousand stevedores loading and unloading cargo from Hongkou Shuntai Wharf to Yangshupu previously went on strike. The foremen have now agreed to adjust the monthly salary to 1,800 yuan, so they have returned to work. Unresolved matters will be discussed again next month.</p>
<p>Knitting Mill Female Workers' Strike</p>
<p>A total of more than 5,000 female workers in the knitting industry in the First and Second Districts, some of whom demanded improved treatment, have gone on strike, which has not yet been resolved. Other labor strikes are summarized as follows: (1) The Chinese drivers and workers at the US Army Transportation Corps went on strike again due to unequal treatment and excessive working hours. As a result, all US soldiers had to drive their own vehicles. It is understood that the drivers resumed work yesterday morning, and the US military authorities have agreed to further improve their treatment. (2) All 200 workers at the Yili Dyeing and Weaving Factory at No. 180, Lane 1371, Xiaoshadu Road, Huxi, have repeatedly sent representatives to the factory to make demands and improve their treatment, but to no avail. Therefore, they went on strike at 6:00 p.m. yesterday. (3) The strike by the workers in the cooked food industry in this city was resolved with the mediation of the Bureau of Social Affairs the day before yesterday.</p>

Speaking of democratic autonomy, China has no long history, and our people do not have much understanding of it, but we must move in this direction, and those who do not understand must learn from everyone. However, democratic autonomy cannot forget the people's lives. Democracy must begin at the local level. The establishment of our Local Autonomy Advancement Association is to engage in local autonomy in a down-to-earth manner in order to realize autonomy and improve the lives of the people. Subsequently, the initiators reported on the association's initiation process, and stated that the foundation of Shanghai's local autonomy work has been destroyed by the enemy, and today it is still at the beginning. However, the National Assembly is about to be convened, and the Municipal Council will be established in April. Such urgent work cannot be ignored. Regarding the organization of the association, Zhu Kongjia advocated that young people should be the backbone, and Zhong Ketuo simply said that the organization of the association should adopt a revolutionary approach, with young people as the center, executing the will and instructions of the elders. Miss Zhang Yulin advocated that the association should not ignore the power of women, as women account for half of the votes in elections. The association had a lively discussion, and the main motions are recorded below: (1) Add Chen Zixin, Shi Wenpu, Wan Molin, etc. as preparatory committee members.

<h3>Overseas Prices Increase - Imbalance in Supply and Demand of Metals - New and Old Steel Mills Have Not Yet Quoted Prices</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] In recent days, overseas metal prices have increased by 10-20% compared to last week. However, the official products from new and old steel mills have not yet received permission from the authorities, so no market prices have been reported. It is said that goods related to military supplies are still under control and cannot be shipped to China without a permit. Due to increased overseas prices and rampant black market exchange rates, the prices in this port have soared uncontrollably. Coupled with the small number of overseas arrivals, the imbalance between supply and demand makes it difficult to expect prices to fall in the short term. The latest overseas metal prices are listed below:</p>
<h3>Grain Administration Authorities to Conduct Grain Merchant Registration Starting Tomorrow</h3>
<p>In order to understand the various grain industries, the Grain Administration Special Envoy's Office has specifically decided to conduct grain merchant registration from tomorrow until the 10th of next month.

<h3>World's Four Major Grain-Producing Countries - This Year's Reserves Decreased</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, February 24] The U.S. Department of Agriculture announced that the world's largest grain exporting countries have the lowest reserves this year since 1940. Wheat reserves are 25% lower than at the beginning of last year. The total wheat supply of the United States, Canada, Argentina, and Australia is only 1,392,000,000 bushels, while at the beginning of 1945, it was 1,868,000,000 bushels. The surplus available for export is approximately between 475,000,000 and 500,000,000 bushels, which is far less than the import needs of various countries around the world. This year's rye supply in the four countries is also 15,000,000 bushels less than last year. Argentina may have a small surplus for export, but the other three countries have no hope of exporting. This year's barley supply is approximately 352,000,000 bushels, while at the beginning of last year, it was 394,000,000 bushels. This year's oat production is higher, but the amount available for export is also extremely small. Rice production totaled 202,000,000 bushels, while last year it was 2,311,000,000 bushels, with the largest decrease in production coming from the United States.</p>
<h3>Speculators Use Rumors - Silk Prices Soared Last Week</h3>
<p>Last week, the silk market saw speculative traders exploiting unfounded rumors, leading retail investors to blindly follow suit, resulting in new record high prices. Artificial silk initially showed a downward trend at the beginning of the week, with the price of "Ying San Zhi Yi Er Ling" (迎三止一二〇) spot goods falling by 200,000 yuan in three days. Unexpectedly, starting on Thursday, stimulated by some kind of news, it suddenly rebounded, rising by a staggering 500,000 yuan in one day. Until Saturday, when trading in warehouse receipts was prohibited, causing panic, the market price began to stabilize. As a result, it rose by 400,000 yuan in one week. Warehouse receipts traded until Friday, with a total increase of over 400,000 yuan in five days. Last week, there was not much trading by factory owners and foreign firms. Factory sales had slightly improved. Prices for various grades increased by approximately 120,000 to 250,000 yuan. Heavy silks were initially weak but became active again starting on Thursday. Compared to Monday, Mei Ya bedding was 200,000 yuan higher, Da Cheng checkered crepe was 630 yuan higher, Minsheng brocade was 1,000 yuan higher, and Lin Ji waxed gauze was 250 yuan higher. Yesterday, Mei Ya bedding was trading at 1,320,000 yuan, and Da Cheng checkered crepe was trading at 4,700 yuan, both approximately 5% lower than on Saturday. Hong Kang black and white crepe was trading at 6,000 yuan per yard, and Minsheng brocade was trading at 18,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Prices of All Grades of Cotton Yarn Reached New Highs Last Week</h3>
<p>Spot yarn prices increased last week due to the surging black market price of gold and reports of some yarn mills reducing production. Furthermore, customer demand for fine yarn was strong, leading to a severe shortage of supply in the market, with demand exceeding supply. The price increase was particularly intense on Friday, with all grades of yarn reaching unprecedented highs. On Saturday, due to the excessively large increase in prices over the previous days, some bulls took profits, causing the market to slightly retreat. The week ultimately closed higher, with the highest price being 3,500,000 yuan for 60-count Sunlight yarn on Friday and the lowest being 550,000 yuan for 10-count Tongxin yarn on Monday, a difference of 2,950,000 yuan. In terms of smaller count yarns, 60-count Sunlight fine yarn increased by 50,000 yuan compared to the previous weekend, while 42-count and 32-count Blue Phoenix each surged by 450,000 yuan, 40-count Blue Phoenix increased by 350,000 yuan, 20-count Special Double Horse increased by 240,000 yuan, 16-count Guangming increased by 190,000 yuan, and 10-count Tongxin increased by 70,000 yuan. The cloth market also thrived, with chick Shilin and Four Gentlemen drill each increasing by 6,000 yuan, Yi Ding Ruyi bleached cloth increasing by 3,000 yuan, An An blue cloth increasing by 5,000 yuan, 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth increasing by 2,000 yuan, and 16-pound coarse cloth increasing by approximately 3-4,000 yuan. The Hua Shi cotton market was most active with purchases from the Fang Jian Company. In addition, the demand from private yarn mills was ordinary. Charter mills were up 12,000 yuan compared to the previous Saturday, Da Zhongji was up 5,000 yuan, Sanyu Town was up 8,000 yuan, Taicang cotton was up 5,000 yuan, Huoji cotton was up 5,000 yuan, and Zhoupu seed cotton was up 5,500 yuan.</p>
<h3>Reason for Delayed Check Clearing House Hours</h3>
<p>According to Mr. Qi of the Shanghai Check Clearing House, the check clearing time for banks and money shops was 3:30 PM before the war. The time was moved earlier several times after Shanghai fell into enemy hands. The Check Clearing House recently delayed the clearing time to 3:30 PM purely because, after the liberation of Shanghai, financial operations have gradually returned to normal. The pre-war clearing time was restored to allow banks and money shops to clear all receipts and payments on the same day. Some people believe that this is to promote the use of checks, hoping to reduce issuance, and others say that delaying clearing can promote speculation, but this is not the case.</p>
<h3>Number of Spindles Operating in Recovered Yarn Factories</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tianjin, February 24] According to announcements, the China Textile Construction Corporation has taken over yarn factories in Tianjin, Shanghai, Qingdao, Jinan, and other places. The number of spindles in operation is as follows: 19 factories in Shanghai, 900,000 spindles; 7 factories in Tianjin, 400,000 spindles; 9 factories in Qingdao, 370,000 spindles; 3 factories in Jinan, over 10,000 spindles; 1 factory in Shijiazhuang, 50,000 spindles. In addition, it is estimated that there are approximately 400,000 spindles in the Northeast.</p>
<h3>Prices Rise in All Regions</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Hankou, February 23] Prices in this area have recently fluctuated dramatically. In the past five days, the price of gold has risen from 140,000 yuan to 170,000 yuan per tael, and the price of rice has risen from 20,000 yuan to 36,000 yuan per shi, with a continued upward trend.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Hangzhou, February 23] Prices in Hangzhou have risen sharply, with white rice costing 28,000 yuan per dan and gold costing 208,000 yuan per tael. The prices of other daily necessities have also doubled, putting public servants and ordinary people in extreme hardship.</p>
<p>[Tianjin News] Due to the long-term uncertainty of exchange rates, international traders are hesitant to observe. Although navigation between Tianjin and Shanghai is open, cargo space for transporting goods from north to south is congested, and it is difficult to secure space without special connections. Therefore, idle funds are flowing into speculation, and the prices of gold, U.S. dollars, and securities are rising, similar to the situation in Shanghai. Foreign merchants in Tianjin hope to load Tianjin bristles and transport them to Shanghai to await shipment. The sale of hides is smooth. The Ministry of Economic Affairs has taken over the North China Electric Power Company. Following an order from the Executive Yuan, electricity prices will be increased by a factor of five starting on the 15th of this month, effectively quintupling the original price.</p>

<h3>Ministry of Education Revises Screening Measures for Teachers and Students in Recovered Areas [Part 1]</h3>

<h3>University Professors in This City Prepare to Form a Union</h3>
<p>[Report from this city] University professors in this city, including Wang Guoxiu, Wang Chengzhi, Yu Rixuan, Hu Zuyin, Lin Handa, Li Baosen, Zhou Changning, Geng Danru, Sun Guiding, Zhang Yaoxiang, Chen Kemei, Chen Qingshi, Chuan Tongxian, Huang Shijin, Huang Jiade, Liu Xian, Liu Dajie, Peng Wenyin, Ying Chengyi, Pan Jianqing, Jiang Zaihua, and others, a total of 21 individuals, have initiated the organization of the Shanghai University Professors' Union to enhance welfare and foster connections. The first preparatory meeting was held yesterday (the 23rd) afternoon at the China Science Society. Approximately 40-50 people from 15 institutions, including John's University, Soochow University, Fudan University, Guanghua University, University of Shanghai, Great China University, Aurora University, Provisional University, and New College, attended. At the meeting, Professor Liu Dajie of Zhijiang University was elected as temporary chairman and reported on the initial preparations. Subsequently, Peng Wenyin, Wang Guoxiu, Lin Handa, Huang Shijin, Chen Kemei, Hu Zuyin, and others expressed their opinions. One professor used the Shanghai Elementary School Teachers' Advancement Association, Occupational Guarantee Association, and Secondary Education Research Association as examples, stating that university professors should quickly organize a university professors' union for their own welfare and occupational protection, and solicit members on a large scale so that university professors also have similar organizations. Attendees enthusiastically supported this suggestion. It was then decided to form a preparatory committee with one representative from each school to expand the membership drive, and to hold an inaugural meeting on March 3. It is said that membership is limited to professors, associate professors, and lecturers.</p>
<h3>Existing Elementary School in Changqiao Town</h3>
<p>Local Residents Request Protection</p>
<p>[Report from our newspaper in this city] There was originally a public full elementary school in Changqiao Town, Longhua District. After the victory, as the area belonged to the urban area, the Municipal Education Bureau sent personnel to take over and resume classes. With the cooperation of the administrative authorities and local residents, the school achieved remarkable results, with enrollment reaching more than 400 students. Recently, it was heard that someone had suggested to the Education Bureau that the school be converted into a girls' middle school. Local residents Pei Yongchao, Pan Xiaoxin, and more than 50 others believe that the establishment of a girls' middle school in that area is not urgently needed, while a complete national elementary school is necessary. They sincerely hope that the authorities will discern the priorities and protect the existing elementary school.</p>

<h3>Tonight's Basketball League - Exciting Program - Shantou Team vs. Giants</h3>
<p>Green Forest vs. Renyu Has Championship Implications - Sacco and Jiangwan Both No-Shows Yesterday</p>
<p>Starting at 5:30 PM today at the City Stadium gymnasium, there will be three intense basketball league matches. In the first match, the Green Team vs. the V Team in the women's division, the former is heavily favored to win the championship due to their solid strength, but the V Team will certainly try their best to resist. In Division II, Green Forest vs. Renyu has championship implications, as Renyu has maintained an undefeated record since the start of the season, while Green Forest has only unfortunately lost one game to the Red Team. Today's game should not be taken lightly. Weighing the two teams' skills and experience, Renyu has the edge, while Green Forest has better teamwork, so it can be said that each team has its own strengths. In Division I, the Shantou Team will face the Giants. The Shantou Team does not seem to be a match for the Giants, but in the league, the Shantou Team has been a consistent winner so far, while the Giants have suffered defeats at the hands of Encars and Jiangwan. Based on recent performance, the Shantou Team may win. It is reported that some of the Shantou Team's top players have left Shanghai, resulting in a loss for the team, which would be a different story.</p>
<p>Also, in yesterday's three matches, both the Sacco and Jiangwan teams did not show up for the final match due to reasons. It remains to be decided by the committee whether this will be considered a double forfeit. In the women's division, Xuebai vs. Xueqing Sisters Circle saw a result as expected, with the score at 33-15 in the first half and 55-37 in the end. In another match in Division II, Desheng defeated the Sixth Regiment. Desheng performed extremely well in the first half, leading with a score of 27-17. The Sixth Regiment tried to counterattack in the second half, even showing signs of catching up in the last five minutes, but due to the limited time and the large deficit from the first half, the result was 52-44, with Desheng defeating the Sixth Regiment. Today's schedule is as follows:</p>
<p>Green Team vs. V Team (Women's) 5:30 PM</p>
<p>Green Forest vs. Renyu (Division II) 6:15 PM</p>
<p>Shantou Team vs. Giants (Division I) 7:15 PM</p>

<p>Special Edition on Production and Construction</p>
<h3>Tea Farmers' Production and Agricultural Loans</h3>
<p>— Wang Naiyi</p>
<p>Our nation is founded on agriculture, and the rural economy occupies an extremely important position in the national economy as a whole. Therefore, the evolution of the rural economy has a significant and far-reaching impact on the entire economic function of the nation and the lives of people from all walks of life. After the war, the most important national policy is to stabilize people's livelihoods. To stabilize people's livelihoods, we must develop agricultural production, as this is the fundamental and urgent task. Therefore, I would like to provide a brief introduction to the connection between tea farmers and agricultural loans, which are important sectors of agricultural production, in the hope of promoting attention and guidance from the authorities.</p>
<p>Looking back at the period of the War of Resistance, tea farmers in various regions fled to other places due to the ravages of war; or they changed from farming to business due to high living costs; or they abandoned tea cultivation due to the favorable returns of other agricultural products, cutting down tea trees and planting other crops instead. Over the years, observers in the industry have noted that the destruction of tea trees has been quite alarming, which is deeply regrettable when we think about it today. According to reports, after tea trees are destroyed, it takes four to five years before they can be harvested again if they are replanted. During the period of suspension of harvesting, it is still necessary to loosen the soil on time and carefully during the Yellow Plum, Beginning of Autumn, and White Dew seasons, and to remove weeds to help the tea trees grow. It is also necessary to apply fertilizers such as human manure and oil cakes to nourish the roots. During this replanting period, not only is there no profit to be made each year, but it is even necessary to add capital for cultivation. Therefore, the magnitude of the harm suffered by tea farmers during the War of Resistance can be imagined.</p>
<p>After victory, the lost territories were recovered, and tea farmers in various regions gradually had local security and protection. Foreign trade could gradually be restored in order. At this moment, tea leaves should have been produced in large quantities to earn foreign exchange for the country. Unfortunately, the reserves of aged tea were not abundant, and the harvesting of new tea was extremely difficult to resume production on a large scale in a short time due to the excessive felling of tea trees—the problem of funds was also an important factor. Over the years, they have suffered so much exploitation that they are already impoverished beyond description. How can they have the surplus capital to revitalize agricultural production? Moreover, the long-term investment required for the harvesting, processing, transportation, and sale of tea leaves is not sufficient without a huge amount of funds. However, many commercial banks are unwilling to invest in agricultural production, because the capital needed for agricultural products does not have the flexibility of lending to industry and commerce, the term is long, and the interest rate is low. Therefore, only national banks can handle this type of loan business.</p>
<p>Regarding the ways to obtain funds, one is to hope for government planning and subsidies; the other is to obtain low-interest loans from state-owned banks. As for how tea farmers can receive this assistance and loan funds, the method seems to require discussion. Generally speaking, tea farmers are scattered everywhere, lack knowledge, and have little contact with the outside world. Even if they sincerely want to apply for a loan, they suffer from not knowing where to apply. Some farmers who can ask others to help them often lack sufficient property and solid businesses to provide guarantees. If loans are made based on the personal credit of farmers, they are often rejected by banks. Therefore, if tea farmers want to obtain funds, they must first form a group and organize a tea farmers' cooperative. Reputable tea farmers from various regions are responsible for the preparation and establishment, and they register with the government in accordance with the law to obtain legal person status, so as to engage in collective joint action. At the same time, the government should seek universality in agricultural loans and determine the amount of loans that the tea farmer sector should enjoy, so that tea loan production can be started and promoted as soon as possible. On the other hand, if it is not easy to lend directly to tea farmers, it is possible to lend to reputable tea merchants for re-lending, because the connection between them is very close, and the effect is not different from direct lending, and it can also increase agricultural and commercial cooperation and promote sales effects. I hope that the government will earnestly and quickly adopt the recommended principles and implement them quickly.</p>
<p>In recent months, the number of new tea companies and firms in this city that have invested in tea has increased, like mushrooms after rain, with a vigorous atmosphere! The domestic sales routes have gradually expanded due to the settlement of the war and convenient transportation; and foreign export trade has also begun. In the future, when overseas shipping is smooth, the prospects will be limitless. A batch of green tea has already been exported to the United States for sale by well-known tea merchants in this city, such as Wang Yutai Tea Firm and China Tea Company. Western-style tea, which has been discontinued by tea merchants in this city for the past few years, has now been revived and is being rushed to meet the needs of the times. For example, Wang Yutai Tea Firm's special mechanical tea making tools have also begun to be rushed. Other companies, such as Zhenxing Tea Company's tea factory, are also starting to add mechanical equipment to rush to make Western-style tea for export. Therefore, the recent prosperity of the tea industry has created the highest record in several years, and the price of tea has also increased several times due to the high demand. The recent rate of increase is greater than that of any other commodity, so those who operate tea have recently made several times the profit. However, because the price of tea chips has risen, the operation funds have also become more difficult. If financial institutions do not provide appropriate financial accommodation, even though tea merchants are currently making huge profits, they will still feel that it is difficult to expand their operations. I, therefore, think of the importance of the responsibilities of tea farmers and tea merchants in the future. I, therefore, present this article, describing the general situation of their industry's difficulties, hoping that the government authorities and state-owned financial institutions will pay close attention and find ways to assist in the promotion.</p>
<p>I heard earlier that the Executive Yuan had allocated funds to the recovered areas for emergency agricultural loans, and that the 324th meeting of the Agricultural Bank of China had allocated agricultural loans of more than two hundred million yuan, which is a considerable amount. However, it has been a long time since it was implemented. Wu Juenong has written articles in various magazines about the needs of tea farmers and tea merchants, but there has been no practical manifestation of the financial authorities. I sincerely hope that the government and financial institutions will announce the exact figures for the allocation of loans to tea farmers as soon as possible. In addition to the funds that have already been lent out in recent months, the remaining loan funds for tea farmers and tea merchants should be cooperated with the tea trade associations in various places and distributed as soon as possible to solve the urgent needs. The tea picking season in the spring is already approaching, and we must not miss the opportunity. If we can rescue them in time, not only will tea farmers be able to seize the opportunity to revive, but the recovery and improvement of the national economy and people's livelihood will also be expected to a great extent.</p>
<h3>Japanese Industry Under Allied Supervision</h3>
<p>— Qinghe</p>
<p>Since Japan announced its surrender, Japanese industrial production has almost completely stopped. Workers have left the industrial areas. Although the production of daily necessities is under the management of the Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers, the resumption of work in various factories is still very slow.</p>
<p>There are several reasons why Japan's industry has not been able to quickly recover to meet the urgent demand for daily necessities. The work of converting wartime factories to peacetime production has been hesitant due to fear of conflicting with the Allied directive prohibiting the production of military supplies. The government's failure to take steps to step up the production of daily necessities is another reason. Japanese industry is under the strict control of the government, so it does not dare to resume work without instructions. These are the reasons why the awakening of Japanese industry has been slow. The Allied forces have prohibited Japanese factories from producing special military supplies and have ordered them to maintain their wartime production capacity, and have also ordered them to provide detailed reports.</p>
<p>The initial task of the Allied forces is to stimulate the production of daily necessities to meet the urgent needs. Factories under the control of the Japanese government have been ordered to produce as much non-military materials as possible. As a result, most factories have resumed work.</p>
<p>As for Japan's foreign trade policy, it has also been determined that all imports and exports should be approved by the Allied Headquarters. Imports are limited to the minimum necessities of the people, and exports are limited to the minimum domestic needs. Barter and commercial import and export trade with other countries have now begun. Parts and other equipment in factories are not allowed to be exported, even for reparations. Japanese gold, silver, and foreign currencies that have been sealed are not allowed to be used to pay for imported goods.</p>
<p>Surplus materials include: 40,000 bales of raw silk, 5 million yards of silk, 30 tons of ivory, and 400 tons of cigarette paper. Goods that are not surplus but are suitable for export due to the needs of other countries include: 10,000 tons of raw hides, 4,200 tons of tin, and 10,000 tons of rubber.

<h3>Production News</h3>
<p>— Guodong</p>
<p>Recently, there has been a record-breaking advancement in the American textile industry. At the Jecoby Textile Mill in Milton, the latest type of machine is installed. Cotton is fed into one end of the machine, and cotton cloth is woven out at the other end. There is no weaving work involved. That factory and several related factories can produce 2 million yards of such cotton cloth each year.</p>
<p>There are a total of 26.5 million spindles in the United States, but since this method was invented, it has not been eclipsed. At the Jecoby factory, after the cotton is fed into the machine, it can be pressed into something that is half an inch thick and 40 inches wide. Then, it is pressed into various thicknesses as needed. Then, the pattern is printed with liquid gypsum to make the woven material stick together and not separate. It can be printed in color or plain color without color, as desired.</p>
<p>The biggest use of that product is as dental towels, diapers, milk filters, and padding. Most of them are prepared to be discarded after use. If the scope of use is expanded in the future, they can also be made into tablecloths, table runners, and curtains. The water absorption is greatly increased, and after use, they can be discarded without washing.</p>
<h3>The World Bank Is Underway</h3>
<p>— Li</p>
<p>The World Bank, which was established based on the Bretton Woods Agreement, has a far-sighted vision. It aims to guarantee loans and provide direct loans for the reconstruction or development of resources in a country. Most of its initial activities will focus on repairing the damage suffered by Europe, and then on developing the world's natural resources and industry.</p>
<p>As of December 21, 1945, U.S. Treasury Secretary Vinson announced that the amount of shares that various countries have agreed to accept is as follows:</p>
<p>United States $2.75 billion</p>
<p>China $550 million</p>
<p>Yugoslavia $60 million</p>
<p>Cuba $50 million</p>
<p>Philippines $15 million</p>
<p>Venezuela $15 million</p>
<p>Abyssinia $6 million</p>
<p>Ecuador $5 million</p>
<p>Guatemala $5 million</p>
<p>Total $3.456 billion.</p>
<p>In addition, the British Parliament has approved the payment of $1.03 billion by the United Kingdom, Canada is preparing to pay $300 million, Belgium $225 million, Mexico $90 million, and Colombia $50 million. The total is $5.421 billion, only $299 million short of the $5.72 billion required for the World Bank's operations. Once the Soviet Union, France, India, or other small countries participate in the payment, it will undoubtedly exceed the required amount.</p>
<h3>The Work-Study System for American High School Students</h3>
<p>— Wen</p>
<p>In the states of America, there are a lot of laws concerning education, mandating that all children under the age of eighteen must be in school. There are also a lot of areas that forbid children under the age of sixteen from working. However, in large cities in America, a lot of families are too poor to allow their children to keep going to school until they're eighteen. Some children drop out halfway, lie about their age in order to find a job, and evade the law concerning schooling.</p>
<p>Thus the school board decided that it would be better not to establish this law than to establish it and not abide by it. And so they initiated a work-study education system to resolve this problem. Students who need to work in order to support their families, or who would prefer to work and feel that studying does not fulfill their needs, can all participate in work-study. In some cities, the work-study students are set to study for four hours and to work at a specified factory for four hours. This education system is called the "Four-Four System". In San Francisco, it is most common and also very effective.</p>
<p>In New York City, the work-study education system is called "Cooperative Education". Two thousand high school students have joined. These students go to class for one week, and then work for one week. Two students handle one job, so for employers, this is like having one full-time employee. There are 165 big factories that are enacting this method.</p>
<p>This method can, on one hand, resolve the labor shortage, and, on the other hand, create an avenue for students. At the same time, it can train the average worker to be able to endure hardships and hard work, and it can economically assist the average poor family. It is indeed worth following suit.</p>
<h3>Overview of Tianlong Dyeing and Weaving</h3>
<p>— Shi Zhiwei</p>
<p>Tianlong Dyeing and Weaving Factory was initially established as a partnership. On February 1, 1932, it was organized as a joint-stock limited company with a capital of 1 million yuan. In September of the same year, the capital was increased to 5 million yuan. In August 1933, the capital was increased to 15 million yuan. In November 1934, it was changed to 20 million national currency. On January 18 of this year, it was approved to change the capital to 100 million yuan. The factory was initially established on Fahuazhen Road. In February 1932, the second factory of Hongmian Factory on Xiaoshadu Road was taken over, producing more than 4,000 bed sheets per day.</p>
<p>In terms of products, in addition to various colored bed sheets, there are also woolen cloth, striped cloth, cashmere and other fabrics. By-products include woven floral cloth and woven floral tea towels. In addition to being sold in major department stores in this city, they are also purchased in Wenzhou, Chongqing, Hong Kong and other places.</p>
<h3>Catching Up</h3>
<p>— Ying</p>
<p>No one can deny that China is an industrially backward country, and compared with advanced countries, the distance is really too far. This time, due to the war and the production situation in other countries, it is even more isolated. You can see some of the progress in foreign production in current foreign magazines. However, China's industrial sector must never stop moving forward because the distance is too far. We must use double the effort to catch up. Then, even if we cannot compete with the foreign industrial sector in a day, at least we will not be eliminated.</p>
<h3>Current Problems in China's Industrial Sector</h3>
<p>— Xu Baiyi</p>
<p>Mr. Li Zufan Discusses the Future of Industry</p>
<p>The China Chemical Industry Society was founded in October of the first year of the Republic of China and has a long history, occupying a glorious page in China's chemical industry. Initially, it was established solely by Mr. Fang Yexian, and in January of the twenty-third year of the Republic of China, it was reorganized into a joint-stock company. During the early stages of the Anti-Japanese War, Mr. Yexian Guangsheng unfortunately went missing, and Mr. Li Zufan took responsibility for presiding over the business, coping with this unprecedented period of hardship. Mr. Zufan has unique insights into industrial construction. He studied factory management in the United States in his early years. I made a special visit to him, and we spoke at length about everything from the situation during the period of the Japanese occupation to the prospects for the industrial sector in the future.</p>
<p>The Bitter Struggle During the Occupation</p>
<p>The China Chemical Industry Society developed year by year because of its very good foundation. In addition to building factory buildings, it also proceeded to research and manufacture various other chemical industrial products besides cosmetics. In the twelfth year of the Republic of China, a second factory was built to specialize in condiments, and in the seventeenth year, a third factory was built to manufacture Samsung mosquito coils. On the eve of the August 13th Incident, it reached a very prosperous period. However, the Japanese authorities investigated China's various businesses very carefully, especially factories related to military preparations. The China Chemical Industry Society had an oil and fat factory, which in addition to manufacturing soap, also produced large amounts of glycerol. Glycerol is an important raw material for manufacturing explosives, so after the start of the Pacific War, it was immediately supervised by the Japan Oil and Fat Co., Ltd. Beforehand, Mr. Zufan knew very well that the large amount of raw materials stored was quite dangerous, so before it was taken over by them, he turned most of the raw materials into finished products, which greatly disappointed the Japanese. After the supervision began, Mr. Zufan adopted an absolutely uncooperative attitude. They wanted to buy, rent, or act as agents, but he did not consider any of these options, answering them directly and frankly. As a result, the Japan Oil and Fat Co., Ltd. made a secret report requesting that the military department severely punish him. Mr. Zufan was also summoned to the military department many times. The era of Japanese supervision was truly a painful period. Later, the Japanese authorities really felt that it could not be utilized, so in early March of the thirty-fourth year, it was handed over to the Enemy Property Management Committee of the puppet government, which returned it for free operation. However, production was reduced as much as possible, simply to overcome difficulties and wait for the arrival of victory.</p>
<p>Construction in the Interior</p>
<p>After the start of the Anti-Japanese War, the China Chemical Industry Society went to Lijiatuo, an industrial area in Chongqing, and established the Yu Factory to manufacture various daily necessities, which was presided over by Mr. Li Zuqian. By the twenty-eighth and ninth years of the Republic of China, it had already taken rough shape, and after the thirtieth year, it had achieved very good results. Since the victory, work has continued. Currently, factories have been shut down one after another, and in the Lijiatuo area, only three or four factories remain, and the Yu Factory of the China Chemical Industry Society is one of them. During the Anti-Japanese War, the society also established a branch factory in Guilin, but in the second half of the thirty-third year, the war situation changed, and it was completely destroyed, resulting in extremely heavy losses, and the employees were displaced, which was an unprecedented disaster.</p>
<p>Future Prospects</p>
<p>As for the prospects for the industrial sector in the future, it is certainly impossible to generalize, but most of the problems encountered by the industrial sector are roughly the same. In general, since the Anti-Japanese War, materials have been used more and more, and have reached the point of exhaustion. The period from the August 13th Incident to the eve of the Pacific War can be said to be the golden age of the industrial sector. Many materials were stored, and there were large sales outlets in Nanyang and other places, so the future looked infinitely bright. However, since the outbreak of the Pacific War, materials have become increasingly depleted, and prices have continued to rise, but the factory's reserves have become increasingly weak, and it is just a kind of paper wealth. Since the victory, because transportation has not been restored, domestic materials cannot be transported, and foreign materials cannot come to China, so it is really not easy to expand production. Regarding business operations, the following issues are causing considerable anxiety in the current industrial sector:</p>
<p>(1) The Foreign Goods Issue: Because imported goods are mass-produced, their prices are very cheap, so general domestic manufacturers have a sense of impending danger. But in fact, as long as transportation can be smooth and the raw material costs of Chinese manufacturers are reduced, the selling price will naturally be reduced. Therefore, to compete with imported goods, importing raw materials is an unavoidable fact. If raw materials cannot be imported and only finished products are imported as much as possible, then Chinese manufacturers will encounter a double blow of having no raw materials, being unable to reduce costs, and being dumped by cheap imported goods. The key to this issue lies in the foreign exchange problem. Although the foreign exchange rate cannot be announced temporarily before the currency system has stabilized, the recent suspension of bank foreign exchange transactions does not seem to be a thorough solution. Since we cannot avoid it, and we will eventually have a face-to-face confrontation with imported goods one day, then why not reach that point as soon as possible, and then gradually adjust. As long as we work hard and bury ourselves in hard work, the future will still be bright.</p>
<p>(2) Labor Issues: Labor issues are quite serious at present. In addition to the rising cost of living, which requires wages to be adjusted at any time, there is also an additional problem, which is the reinstatement of workers who were laid off before the Anti-Japanese War. The municipal government has issued a clear order that it is not necessary to accept the reinstatement requests of those workers, which is indeed a wise measure that takes into account the difficulties of the industrial sector. It is hoped that the authorities responsible for mediation can implement it in accordance with the clear order, because there were already appropriate measures in place when they were laid off before, and it is really unreasonable to demand reinstatement now. At the same time, technically speaking, workers laid off by Factory A may go to Factory B, and workers laid off by Factory B may go to Factory A, which can be a win-win situation. If they insist on returning to the original factory, it will cause great difficulties.</p>
<p>(3) Government Policy: The current industrial sector feels at a loss because the government's policy has not been clearly announced. For example, the issue of state-owned and private enterprises, and the entire financial issue, are all things that the industrial sector hopes to have clear regulations on as soon as possible. Moreover, after the regulations are made, they must be carried out in accordance with the original intention, without any changes, so that China's industrial sector can cooperate with the environment and move forward.</p>
<p>(4) Trade Associations: The organization of trade associations should normally be a sound group. In terms of work, it should be able to solve all the problems of the industry, protect the welfare of the industry, and improve the standards of the industry's products. However, the current trade associations cannot achieve these points. The reason is nothing more than mutual suspicion between the various factories, and unwillingness to be open and honest for the sake of the future of the entire industry. Another reason is that the types of trade associations are too numerous and complex. For example, the China Chemical Industry Society must join five associations at the same time. However, most people join associations only to pay membership fees, and do not ask about other affairs. Also, because there are too many categories, each association does not have the power to hire full-time staff with the ability to handle all affairs. Therefore, it is difficult for trade associations to reach the ideal state. In fact, it may be possible to reduce the number of categories as much as possible and concentrate them, so that experts can be hired and ideas can be pooled to study and discuss. On the one hand, various suggestions can be contributed to the government, and on the other hand, efforts can be made to improve technology.</p>
<p>Before the Anti-Japanese War, Mr. Zufan tried to improve the technology of the condiment industry association, established a chemical laboratory, and held random inspection methods. All qualified products were given a prescribed seal. This move could avoid the industry from using inferior goods for mixed sales and causing unnecessary competition between the industries, and could further enhance the reputation of the entire industry in society, and later achieved great results. In the early days of the Anti-Japanese War, only Fuzhou was accessible, and the customs there specified that only flavored powders with seals could be imported. From this example, it can be seen that trade associations are indeed a matter of human effort.</p>
<p>In summary, the future of the industrial sector completely depends on whether transportation can be restored as soon as possible, whether the government's policy can be comprehensively regulated, and whether colleagues in the industrial sector can continue to work hard and catch up. Then China's industrial sector can reach a prosperous era.</p>
