<h3>國共重開政治商談　對停戰恢復交通等問題　雙方均表示願力促實現</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿五日電〕爭取全面和平之停戰，復路商談，經馬歇爾特使，俞大維，周恩來幾度會談後已具體化。廿五日上午，周恩來會應邀至寗海路五號，與馬使續商政府所提從速恢復津浦，平漢兩路交通，以拯救大河南北數在千萬以上垂危之難民一重要前提，並聞國共雙方代表會約於今日午後就解決當前有關停戰·復路·重開政協會議各項重要問題，作懇切之商談，聞雙方意見已視前接近，但中共對恢復津浦，平漢兩路交通一事，尙在考慮中。並傳中共代表團正急電延安請示，以應付當前之新局勢。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿五日電〕國共商談之門今日重啓，下午五時，政府代表邵力子，正世杰，張厲生，中共代表周恩來，董必武，陸定一暨政協秘書雷震等，在首都瑯琊路　靜之八號小洋房會客室內，曾舉行一歷史性之會談，聞會談之時間幾達三小時。</p>
<p>〔中央社南京廿五日電〕沉寂甚久之政治商談，今已重開。政府代表今日下午五時邀請中共代表在瑯琊路八號邵秘書長力子公館會談，此殆為還都後政府與中共代表就政協有關問題作首次正式之商談，政府代表王世杰·邵力子·張厲生及中共代表周恩來·董必武·陸定一·秘書長雷震均出席。據悉，今日會談內容，乃就停止軍事衝突，恢復交通及停止相互作刺激性之宣傳等三項問題，彼此交換意見，最後，雙方均表示，願努力促其早日實現。</p>
<p>〔合眾社南京廿五日電〕一月來之政治僵局，因國民黨與共產黨代表相互非正式交換意見，今晚已顯露解決曙光。</p>
<p>〔聯合社南京廿五日電〕國共雙方高級人員，今日假邵力子寓所舉行會談，自長春經國軍收復後，國共間類似正式之談判，以此為第一次。</p>
<p>〔中央社本市訊〕中央黨部秘書吳鐵城氏，前晚由京抵滬，昨接見記者談稱：余此行係乘週末假期，來滬休息，并料理私事，兩日內即返京，并未與各方會談。記者叩詢對當前大局觀感，吳氏態度至表樂觀。渠稱：政府與各黨派及人民同樣期望實現和平，統一，團結。最近國軍收復長春，係接收主權，對于大局，當然很裨益，但能否打開實現澈底和平，統一商談之僵局，當全視中共第二步之行動如何。</p>
<h3>國軍向哈吉前進中　孫立人將軍同情受苦民眾</h3>
<p>〔合眾社北平廿五日電〕據今日權威方面消息：社聿明將軍所部國筆，於佔領長春後，據悉：向哈爾賓方面推進之國軍，曾遭林彪所部共產軍若干抵抗，刻已越過長春廿五哩。</p>
<p>〔中央社藩陽廿五日電〕七一軍九一師師長趙琛，於十七日黎樹太平岑激戰時，曾身光士卒，指揮作戰，致頭部負傷，刻已送來瀋陽療治。按黎樹係林彪總總所在地，太平岑地勢險要，所築工事極為堅固，縱深壕清數層，國軍　三日激戰，方始克復。</p>
<p>〔聯合社北平廿五日電〕杜聿明所部肅清長春共軍殘部後，今日　沿鐵路線北上，向哈爾賓推進，保安第二總隊長劉德　，傳於上月十八日共軍攻陷長春前數小時逃出，劉氏暨其他國軍官佐士兵約千人，同在長春大同席場司令部為共軍包圍，劉氏親率一百人將共軍擊退，然後突圍而去。</p>
<p>〔合眾社公主嶺一軍戰地司令部廿四日電〕（遲到）新一軍司令孫立人中將稱：中國之內戰可能在長春結束，因政府軍隊於佔領此一東北首邑之後，「將暫停前進，等待訓令」。孫氏在招待美，法，蘇，英，中各國新聞記者之會議席上云：「吾人憎恨內戰，吾人與日本人作戰甚久，民眾受苦極深，茍此輩（暗指共產黨）稍有心腸，決不願摧殘國家，而使人民處於更凄慘之境地」。孫將軍對佔領東北期間「蘇聯盟軍」之惡劣紀律，施以攻擊，渠謂：蘇軍曾強姦十二歲以上之東北婦女，蘇聯「盟軍」將一切最佳之車輛，機車及工業設備拆走，以蘇聯之掠奪行為，與日本在東北工業上發展之行為相較，「有一極大之差別」。孫將軍所部軍隊，自租借法案停止以後，軍火正感缺少，現在實行節省辦法，參加印緬戰役，有美式配備之新六軍，亦有同樣情形。</p>
<p>〔合眾社長春廿四日電〕今日午間，長春城區已全入國軍之手，美式　備之新一軍進城時，民眾熱烈歡呼，夾道相迎，民眾對今日自四平街到此之新聞記者，亦予以歡呼。長春本身幾未遭戰爭之損害，城內水電與電話照常可用，車站上若干輕機車及數約兩百之車輛，均未遭共軍破壞。國軍縱隊主力，刻已向長春以北推進十哩。</p>
<h3>蔣主席在瀋　巡視鐵西工廠區</h3>
<p>〔本報北平廿五日電〕蔣主席在瀋，曾召見孫越琦，對接收各大小工廠情形垂詢頗詳，並面　積極　備各工廠復工，　迅速恢復生意，孫氏受命後，正加緊　　各廠開工，返平赴京之則已告展綏。又馬歇爾元帥將飛瀋說，未經官方證實。</p>
<p>〔中央社瀋陽廿五日電〕蔣主席廿五日下午四時乘車赴鐵西工廠區巡視一週，繼往東其行營及東北保安司令長官部視察，晚九時接見孫總司令　，孫　長　人等。</p>
<h3>美巨機一架　贈送蔣主席</h3>
<p>〔中央社華監頓廿四日電〕美作戰物資管理處本日宣布，美國以剩餘之道格拉斯式　　　四引擎運輸機一架，贈送蔣主席，此係美國國務院之建議。</p>
<h3>長春二蘇人被殺　國軍採緊急措施</h3>
<p>〔合眾社長春廿四日電〕今日此間有蘇聯人二名在羣眾暴動下被中國亂民所殺，此舉可反映彼等對國軍收復長春前憤恨蘇聯人舉動之一種表示。國軍當即採取緊急措施，將留居長春之蘇聯人一百六十名，移入半月前拘留美記者五人之大和旅館，並向彼等提出警告，如彼等冒險走出旅館，國軍不能負彼等安全之責。殺害事件，發生於國軍尙在城內進行肅清戰之際。</p>
<h3>陸定一之聲明</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京廿五日發表中共代表團陸定一氏之聲明謂：「民主聯軍之由長春撤出，乃奉延安方面準備命令而實行者」。此間觀察家認為，陸氏之聲明，乃係為顧全「民主聯軍」之面子而發者。且此項聲明借為時過晚，觀察家並進一步指陳，如陸氏之聲明其目的在說明中共對政府曾已接收而由共軍佔領之東北各地，如哈爾濱，齊齊哈爾等區，均將自動退出，不妨碍政府接收主權之行動，則視延安是否亦將命令自此等地區撤退，方可為事實之考騐。</p>
<h3>楊綽庵彭濟羣等　昨離海參威來滬　留平東北接收人員赴瀋</h3>
<p>〔本報北平廿五日電〕某方消息：哈爾濱市長楊綽庵，嫩江主席彭濟羣及長春撤出接收人員四十餘人，定今日海參威乘輪赴滬。昨日楊等曾電此間有關方面，長春　市長君邁及吉林王代主席，諒已為自長退出之共軍挾去。</p>
<p>「本報瀋陽廿四日電〕中央前留長春人員，聞已被共軍帶往吉林，東北行營熊主任特令吉林省府民政廳長尙傳道兼代長春市長，尙氏等定廿五日偕秘書長劉守剛等一行七人，專車赴長視事。</p>
<p>〔中央社大津廿五日電〕中央各部會留北平東北接收人員百餘名，廿五日晨由平搭車過津赴瀋陽。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社長春廿四日電〕外國記者一行數人，自四平街公主嶺行抵此間，人民手持國民黨黨旗前往歡迎，並高呼「頂好」，長春民眾聞國軍開到，異常與　，均冒雨前往歡迎。</p>
<h3>顧維鈞飛平　將赴東北視察</h3>
<p>〔聯合社南京廿五日電〕顧維鈞今日與鮑萊同機飛平，日內將赴東北視察。十三年前，顧氏曾偕國際聯盟派遣之李頓調查團前往調查，對於東北問題素具權威，此次向中央政府提出之報告，自必大有力量。</p>
<p>〔聯合社南京廿五日電〕聯合社記者今日自外交部可靠方面獲悉，駐英大使顧維鈞或交調任駐美大使。</p>

<h3>北寗路恢復常態　泊頭鎮又生衝突</h3>
<p>〔本報北平廿五日電〕交通界息：被共軍攻佔之泊頭鎮，又發生衝突，磚河附近共軍一個團，昨渡河向天津方面移動中。</p>
<p>〔合眾社北平廿五日電〕據由海關車站長停電話報告：北寗鐵路車務，經兩星期左右之阻斷後，業已恢復常態。</p>
<p>〔中央社天津廿四日電〕天津至滄縣間長途電話線，前被砍壞，廿三日已修復通話，由海關昌黎間長途線廿日下午五時半，遭共軍割斷，由津至關外電話，現仍不通。</p>
<h3>立法院會議　通過廢止戰時軍律等案　促宋院長報告財經政策</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿五日電〕立法院第四屆第三百次會議，今晨九時在京舉行，到立法委員孫九錄·洪瑞　·樓桐蓀·簡貫三·陳訓　·陳長　·陳海證·譚　吾等六十六人，孫科主席，首由該會秘書長報告上次會議紀錄及中　，中厄友好條約，呈奉國民政府指令應准照辦，業已令行政院轉飭外交部依例辦理等五項，旋開始討論，計甲，通過案如次：（一）交通部組織法修正草案，（二）國立邊　文化教育館組織條例草案（按黃佑昌·樓桐蓀·趙迺傳等對「邊彊」二字，曾有所引伸，）（三）核復廢止中華民國戰時軍律案，（四）核復將處理在華美軍人員弄事案件條例展限一年案，（五）核復廢止硝磺類管理條例案，（六）審查中華民國卅四年度國家普通歲出西康省第十二次追加預算書案，（七）審查中華民國卅五年度交通部主管鋼鐵配作廠營業預算案。乙，經保留案件：（一）首都警察廳組織條例草案，保留原因，內以　天心等委員提出目前各地施行之警管區制度與本案有關，旋決議與警察總署案合併約論，　付審查，交下次會議討論，（二）貨物統稅條例草案，（三）國產菸酒類稅條例草案，以上兩案保留原因，乃以征收貨物稅之貨物項目未能完善，應重付審查，增加項目，再行修正。丙，臨時動議：（一）立法院曾於上次會中決議，請行政院宋院長於本次例會時出席報告財政，經濟政策，茲經宋院長覆函，認為戰後財政，經濟頭緒紛繁，請開示項目，以使書面（）答覆，唯各委員以立法院乃政府最高立法機關，國家一切措施，應有明文始能核定一切法規，故決再函敦請宋院長，於下次例會列席報告，並資質訽，（二）由院長指定數人，對當前財政、金融、經濟情況專門　查，未經孫院長提稱：本會上次例會所決定公務員增加薪給倍數，乃為原薪之六百倍，加生活津貼十五萬元，唯中央社會於是日發出新聞稱增一千倍，加生活津貼二十萬（是日本報專電無訛），實係誤傳，並予更正，旋經李慶　·簡貫三·戴修駿等各委員發表，對一般外界謬見有所解釋，會場中申辦頗為激烈，至一時許始散會。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿五日電〕關於公務員增加薪津一事，立法委員孫九錄·樓桐蓀等稱：現行公務員薪津，委實太低，立法院核定以底薪之六百倍加生活津貼十五萬元，並不過高，查中紡公司職工即以八十元底薪加二千倍，八十元以上者一千倍，招商局則一律為二千倍，故彼等一工役即可得十餘萬元，至有人謂因此新規定將使國家總預算問加六萬九千萬元及刺激物價上漲說，殊不可信。因公務員薪津迄今僅增一百六十倍，而物價已增至三千或五千倍</p>

<h3>熱河省三執行小組　即出發調處衝突　共軍三萬人團攻葉柏壽</h3>
<p>〔本報北平廿五日電〕軍部政府方面派往熱河北票之代表朱戒吾，今已返平，據稱：經其聯絡結果在熱省承德，赤峯·朝陽之三執行小組即可出發，開始調處熱境之衝突。</p>
<p>〔中央社朝陽廿四日電〕熱河共軍於四月十三是會庥中數萬人發動攻勢，對北票·古山·熱水·平莊等地，迭次　列攻擊，並實行大規模之破壞，至使一般民眾流離失所，十室九空，近復變本加厲，糾合共軍三萬餘人，向葉柏壽圍攻，據確報：有廿二·廿七·三十旅及第一·三旅，其中並夾有日人，並有多數騎兵，雙方激戰數日，共軍並斷絕行旅，封銷糧食。</p>
<h3>王耀武派員飛赴臨沂　邀孫毅商談魯局　山東戰事多人膠着狀態</h3>
<p>〔本報濟南廿五日電〕軍息：共軍在禹城附近集結兵力二萬餘人，有進攻齊河，濟南企圖。又共軍三千餘人，由龍山增至郭店，並附汽車四十餘輛，現向十里鋪推進，揚言將進攻濟南。</p>

<p>〔本報濟南廿四日電〕共軍對膠濟沿線及濟南外團之攻勢，由於國軍採取緊急撥施，予以有效之阻擊，其所焰已措殺，截至昨日止，各地戰事多入膠着狀態。僅郭店方面略有小衝突，週來魯局之緊張空氣，顯已和綏。惟　困泰安，　州，聊城，德縣等地之共軍兵力續有增加，青島近郊共軍調動仍極頻繁，周村，張店附近一帶，共軍集結四萬餘人，頗有伺機進窺模樣。</p>
<h3>膠濟津浦兩線　最近行車情形</h3>
<p>〔本報濟南廿四日電〕膠濟線自共軍攻佔明水，龍山等站後，東行火車即告停頓，路局為維持交通，將原有濟南，張店間混合列車，普通客車各一次，改為每間日由濟南開郭店混合列車一次，當日返濟南。津浦線濟南，泰安間及濟南，晏城間，日前仍在維持原狀。</p>
<p>〔本報濟南廿四日電〕據此間軍政當局表示，關於共軍在膠濟線上攻佔之　山，四水等地，當續由執行小組與共軍進行談判，希望共軍遵從和平方式，自行撤退。</p>
<p>〔本報濟南廿三日電〕廿三日郭店有小接觸，惟共軍對聊城，德州，泰安增集大軍，加緊封銷，情勢險重，魯軍政當局表示，決以合理方法使其自行退却。</p>

<h3>林逆柏生在京審結　定本月卅一日上午宣判</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿五日電〕僞宣傳部長林逆柏生，今日上午十　在首都高院第一法庭公開受審，法庭之佈置，觀眾之擁護，一如開審梅思平時，中央廣播台中面攝影場，仍到場轉播和拍攝新聞片，審判長趙琛，推事葛之　，金蓼　，檢察官李師沆，書記官徐翌振華時升　，林逆穿淺灰色派力司長袍，黃皮鞋，鼻架銀色托力克無邊眼鏡，親　　，五短身材，搖搖擺擺入公堂，於萬目睽睽下林逆引頸顧盼，神態自若。林逆廣東人，四十五歲，戰前曾任立法委員，國際問題研究所主任，中宣部駐港特派員，香港南華日報社長等戰。李檢察官宣讀起訴書，後審判長即詢以何以不到重慶去？林答僅到漢口，即率派到香港任國際問題研究所主任。又問何時與汪發生關係？答稱本跟廖仲凱先生工作，廖先生死後即跟隨汪精衛。關於　電一節，林逆推得乾凈，構事前並未知道　電內容，廿八日由陳公博交來，始知道在南華日報並送中央社發表，當時因顧孟餘反對，所以遲發了一天，但和梅逆思平一樣稱是奉命發表，大概漢奸的理論都相似。林逆又稱，當時汪精衛是本堂副總裁，曾給他一信，說「　霓」不過是建議，和是全而和，戰是全面戰，和由中央，戰也由中央，所以他認為是未脫離黨的立場。至於與敵人收秘密談判之事，林一概含糊其詞，諱莫如深。唯僞六全大會僞政治會議，隨汪赴日觀見昭和等，皆供認不諱。對於盜用國統一點，林逆狡辨稱：「因為國家不能分裂，國體不能變更」。審判長厲聲問道：「在重慶有一個真正國民政府，你知道不知道？」林勉強答稱：「知道，不過我們的在淪陷區」。即遭審判長一語道破，「那末分明是冒牌了」。於是引起哄堂大笑，林逆也聳戶蹙眉，醜態畢露。</p>
<h3>為文詆毀中央　林逆當庭認罪</h3>
<p>審判長又提出僞府大膽與日秘密簽訂和平方案，基本條約，中日同盟等亡國滅種條約相詰，林強辨稱：「外交有進有退，這是一種技術，在當時環境不得不委屈求全」。當審判長問到他所寫的一篇「從九三想到九九」文章時，林逆突然神明內疚，表示懺悔稱：「那篇文章對中央政府蔣主席有底毀，我承認錯誤」。審判長又提到林逆在「僞安徽省長」任內，公賣鴉片，向烟館收費等事，林逆矢口否認，並稱：「柏生如果拿過鴉片上的錢，請政府在這點上槍斃我，政府不槍斃我，人民也可以槍斃我」，一連串的「槍斃」，或許立刻可以成他的懺悔。再問財產家屬後，庭上宣佈開始辨論。林逆鼓其如簧之舌，大放厥詞，本其一套愚民理論，竟有聲有色的演講起來，一溫他僞部長的舊課，似乎已忘記他正在被告欄裏，不管其講演技術如何高明，然其歪曲內容，終不能得到同情他，把僞青少年團禁毒運動，極力強調，認為這是不可湮沒的「功績」，其答辯竟達一小時又十分鐘之久。林逆講畢。公役辯護人劉賢才起立辨護三點：（一）彼告戰前曾跟廖促凱先生工作，有功於國家，（二）僞宣傳部長任內，尙有國家觀念，並曾推動禁毒運動，（三）能自己認錯不失坦白真誠。二時二十五分辯論終結，庭　本月卅一日上午十時宣判，林逆還押。林逆表妹張許淑及姪林賈亦出席旁聽，據彼等對本報記者稱，林之家庭人口極多，現在上海生活困難，全賴友朋維持。</p>

<h3>美蘇未能成立諒解　使遠東政局不安　威爾斯稱美應急起直追</h3>

<h3>改訂進口稅則芻議</h3>
<p>— 徐繼莊</p>
<p>（一）現行匯率對於貿易之影響</p>
<p>最近中央政府所訂對外匯率，比較高昂。以美匯論，每元美金合國幣二千零二十元，就戰前每元美金合國幣三元論，僅約提高六百七十倍強，但國幣在國內之價值，最近已跌至二千分之一弱，因此國內外貨價脫離常規，國幣在國際間之價值提高太多。在如此匯率下，進口價值必遠過於出口而有鉅額入超，國際貿易方面，將發生下列現象：</p>
<p>（甲）因國幣匯率較高，非但市場洞開，且人為的有利於進口。各國正紛紛謀推廣出口以爭奪戰後之市場，必將以大量商品連至我國銷售，我國商人亦因利潤關係，必將紛紛捨棄國貨而訂購外貨，結果貿易入超之增加將壓迫匯兌市場而使匯價難於維持。</p>
<p>（乙）國貨因原料價昂，工人薪資太高，加以運輸困難，生產技術劣下，製成品之價值以二千對一之匯率折算，均在外貨之上，勢難運銷國外，馴至出口業無法經營。現在中國出口貨在世界市場上幾成為最貴之商品，前途甚為黯淡！</p>
<p>（丙）我國工業戰前本不發達，經戰事　殘，瀕於破產，戰後原料昂貴，生產技術一時尙難改進，在二千對一之匯率下，製成品不能與外貨競爭，則此先天脆弱之工業，在人為之匯率下，亦將復振無日。</p>
<p>（丁）進口貨廉，物價對於民眾之壓力，雖一時　感輕減，就久經艱苦之民眾言，雖不　　益，惟長此以往，進口貨愈來愈多，將國貨驅出市場之外，不獨輸出入不能平衡，工業破產，國家必日趨貧困，且購買力日弱，馴至進口貨亦將萎縮，僅少數富有階級或尙能消耗若干進口奢侈品，而民族工業衰微，機械器材　敗，皮之不存，毛將焉傳，整個經濟勢必無法復興。</p>
<p>鑒於上述對於國際貿易可能發生之劣勢，有人主張更改匯率，以為補救。其理由為較低之匯率，有促進出口貿易之作用；出口貿易發展以後，生產出口貨之農工業亦因之復興，人民就業及所得，均可隨之增加，尤其內地，當人口及經濟力量移向沿海後，可能發生物價下落經濟蕭條之現象，藉促進出口貿易使內地生產方面轉而從事出口貨物之生產，乃一最有效而又最自然之補救辦法。此等主張，固亦有其理由，惟匯率減低以後，雖可促進出口，但對進口則極端不利。在中國正殷切需要國外物資從事經濟建設之時，若因匯率之故，使必要之進口成本增加，對雅趣建設工作，阻擬極大，尤重要者，則匯率改低，足以刺激國內物價，使其上漲。現在物價之漲勢已經極著，再加以貶低匯率之刺激，必將更增加物價之波動。</p>
<p>作者以為欲利用國外物資為建設之用，同時使進口貨不致妨碍國內工一之發展，恃匯率為操縱工具，不如利用關稅政策較有效果且富彈性也。</p>
<p>（二）進口稅則有立即改訂之必要利用關稅政策可使國際貿易較近平衡，民族經濟稍得穩定，進口稅則尤有立即改訂之必要。</p>
<p>我國現行之進口稅則，係民國二十三年所公佈，彼時不平等條約尙未取消，關稅政策尚未完全自主，末一次修訂稅則，表面上雖屬自動，事實上頗受日本之牽制。況自遜清以來，長時期在半殖民狀態下生存，彼時歐美各國挾其政治及經濟雙重力量，保護其大量商品在中國市場傾銷，曾以通商條約，阻止中國建立良好關稅制度。其後關稅雖先獲自主，而積重仍難猝返，國內生產基礎未立，關稅收入又為當時政府之最大財源，故歷來我國所訂進口稅則，往往注重於稅收多寡，不能完全符合國民經濟之要求。抗戰軍興，沿海淪陷，進出口貿易，一落千丈，及滇緬路中斷，國內外已無路可通，關稅乃成為次要問題，而一班經濟學者，方始集中心力討論如何開闢財源，以應付非常時期之軍政費用，更無餘睱從事進口稅則之研究。現在勝利來臨，九月於茲，當時國防最高委員會通過開放外匯市場一案，本以外匯與貿易並重，中央銀行管理外匯暫行辦法本與進出口貿易暫行辦法相輔而行，同時公布，「自由進口」「許可進口」「禁止進口」之貨物亦經分別編列清單。公布此一貿易辦法之精神，受世界減低貿易障碍之浪潮，尤其受美國貿易自由主張之影響，除少數進口須經許可及禁止外，全部皆屬自由進口。此種原則雖不便變更，但自由進口之貨物，其稅率高下，則仍頗多伸縮餘地，如將稅率高低重行改訂，則進口貨所受外匯優利之刺激，頗可用稅率使之抵消或沖減，因而可以補救匯率過高之弊。</p>
<p>尤有進者，則匯率之上落，影響整個國際貿易，對於進口出口，對於進口之各種貨物，出口之各種貨物，其影響普遍一致，不能有差別高低。關稅政策則無此困難，對於各種進出口貨可各定不同之稅率，幫必需要而應受鼓勵之進口貨，可征收極低之稅或竟免稅，使其得亭優利之蕩率而進口，不需或不必鼓勵之進口貨，可施以較高之進口稅，使其進口貨價雖因匯率優利而甚低，迨加上關稅，不致與國產品相距過遠。此種差別待遇，惟有改訂進口稅率，方足以資補救。</p>
<p>（三）改訂進口稅率之原則</p>
<p>我國產業落後，為促進生產發展，應在不妨礙國際保作之原則下，將民國二十三年所公佈之進口稅則，予以廢止，根據下述原則，訂定新進品稅率：</p>
<p>甲，有關工業化之機械器材，稅率從低或予免稅。</p>
<p>乙，本國不能產生之原料，從低征稅。</p>
<p>丙，民生日用必需品，在國內工業尙未恢復以前，一時不能製造者，減低其進口稅，惟此等稅率，應作彈性規定，并按國內工業發展情形，隨時予以增減。</p>
<p>丁，奢侈品稅率，儘量提高，使此等物品，除少數高有偕級外，一般國民，絕無購買之能力。</p>
<p>戊，興國產競爭之物品，其進品稅率，須特予提高，使國產品在國內市場有競爭之可能。</p>
<p>已，津貼出口或另加其他鼓勵。</p>
<p>如此，以後進口貨之價值應可減少，出口貨之價值或可加增，國際貿易出入超應可較近於平衡，匯市上需求可不致常有一面倒之趙勢，而匯率之穩定亦必較可維持。國內進口物價，雖將因關稅而增加，但匯率不動，則人心安定，即不致有刺激一般物使貪使愚　之慮。國內生產，可以在相當的條件下與進口貨競爭，不致被人為的匯率所犧牲，而復興建設之器材，仍可於極有利之匯率下輸入。故改訂進口稅則，各方面可以兼顧，經建前途，實利賴之。</p>

<p>〔聯合社華盛頓廿五日電〕杜魯門總統今日在白宮向全國罷工鐵路員廣播，限於今日標準時間下午九時復工，否則將令陸軍接管火車。總統將此次罷工與日軍偷襲珍珠港相比擬，據稱：罷工已使政府面臨空前未有之挑戰行為，吾人必須出而應戰，否則係自認無能。鐵路職工兩工會領袖瓊士頓與惠提奈謂罷工係因有人將私利置諸國家幸福之上，予不以為然，如限期一屆仍無充分人數復工，予將命令軍人開駛火車，並派兵保護復工員工。總統廣播畢，表示擁護之電文紛至呇來。惟鐵路職工會領袖拒不發表意見，罷工員工反應如何，亦尙未定。總統向罷工者稱：予曾　告瓊士頓及惠提奈，請其捫心自問，並對因罷工而引起之死亡與飢餓情形加以考慮。國會領袖稱：眾院將雅趣總統演說後繼續開會，以便通過總統所半提出之任何法案。參院於總統廣播後亦同意對勞工法案暫不再辨論。惟多數黨領袖馬克萊稱，不信總統將於星期六夜向參眾兩院聯席會議提出「確定具體」之建議。</p>
<p>（又電）杜魯門總統今日向全國鐵路罷工員工廣播，稱：予懷疑　路職工兩工會會員於罷工時，是否亦曾思及因罷工而引起這不幸後果，救濟糧食之運輸，現告中斷，十萬噸五穀因罷工而無法起運，各國人民現僅能糊口而已，其每日所需，正有待美國之救濟。美國少數人實行罷工，竟使此項救濟糧食不能運出，豈知數萬人之生死，即繁於此，此種情形，寗不可悲。如美國鐵路不在即恢復行駛，則國內外數萬民眾將飢餓而死。</p>
<h3>白宮舉行特別會議　艾帥亦被召回參加　火車將以軍人駕駛</h3>
<p>〔美國新聞處華盛頓廿四日電〕杜魯門總統本日下午如開特別會議，國務卿·財長·陸長·海長·內長·勞工部長·總檢察官·動員管理外長，國防運輸局主任，及總統鐵路工潮調解人史蒂爾曼博士等均出席。陸軍總參謀長艾森豪威爾元帥已縮短其旅行，渠宣稱：渠已接到命令，立即前往華盛頓參加會議。陸軍部發言人稱：陸軍已枕戈待命，於必要時保護鐵路，但罷工聲中並無暴動之消息。郵政部宣佈　寄外埠郵件，航空郵件，僅以十六盎斯甫量者為限。聯總署長賴伽第亞本日在此間稱：鐵路罷工，使糧食救濟運送計劃完全打翻。</p>
<p>總統調解人昨與鐵路勞資雙方談判達八小時之久，直至昨晚九時談判始告決裂，鐵路工潮亦隨之正式展開。工會領袖正式表示反對總統之建議，要求一律增加時薪百分之十八點五，此為彼等撤消職工要求改定新條例及改善工作情形之條件。</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓二十四日電〕美國鐵路員工罷工後，各工廠有受影響，而關閉者。據熟知罷工局勢之政府官員稱：政府接收各鐵路後將考慮派遺有開車經騐之士兵駕駛火車，而以陸軍鐵路隊人員為其基幹。前在陸軍鐵路隊服務現已退伍之軍人，亦考慮將其重行召回，海軍陸戰隊亦已令其待機出動。如此即可有充分人數，足使國內各主要鐵路不致停頓，但召集此項退伍軍人亦需相當時間，恐至下星期始能使各鐵路維持最低所需之火車班次。</p>
<p>〔聯合社美國加州奧克蘭二十五日電〕美國鐵路員工實行罷工後，美海軍四引擎運輸機二十四架現在自太平洋及亞洲各基地兼程　回，以供差遣。據美國全國空輸處稱：該處檀香山·關島·東京·馬尼拉及上海間空運將因此而減少百分之四十。</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓廿四日電〕政府調解員史蒂爾曼今日與鐵路員工談判數小時後宣稱：「工潮局勢黑暗」。今日全國罷工人數已達九十六萬人，更有數萬人受鐵路罷工影響隨時可以賦閑。</p>
<h3>救濟物資凍結</h3>
<p>〔路邊社華盛頓二十五日電〕聯總及美政府農業部官員稱：鐵路員工之罷工，使美國在數星期內無從輸出國外所需之糧食，歐亞兩洲之　　區，怠工繼續延長，則今夏必遭浩刦。又據聯總總部發言人稱：東西兩岸港口之大部份救濟物資，均被凍結，聞碼頭工人又有將於下月初罷工之說，現聯總官員，正與工人之領袖磋商，要求准許聯總船舶之繼續裝運。</p>
<h3>星洲碼頭工人　二千人昨罷工</h3>
<p>船隻活動陷於停頓</p>
<p>〔聯合社新加坡二十五日電〕此問碼頭工人二千名，今日實行罷工，原國為有中國工人一名，因故腿部遭人擊傷，碼頭工人乃被告罷工，以為聲援。港口船隻活動，陷於停頓，港口對當局制止罷工經過，不欲有所發表。</p>
<h3>凡爾賽和約　原本遺失</h3>
<p>〔中央社巴黎廿四日電〕第一次世界大戰後，一九一九年凡爾賽和約上有和會代表簽字之原本，已遺失，或為德人毀滅。此事係根據法外交部於該部外交檔案委員會成立時，所宣佈者。一九一九年之和約，除在華府法大使館留存一份外，均遭毀滅或遺失。一九四〇年六月德軍進逼巴黎時，法官員會焚毀若干於此期間之有關政治之外交文件。德人取得其遺留部份，轉送柏林，後移至里西亞。迨一九四〇年七月三日，移厄柏多　，同年為美軍發現，交還法國。</p>
<h3>英閣訪印代表團　發表二次宣言　過渡期間英軍仍留駐印度　國大黨對英建議重早立場</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦廿五日廣播：兩小時前（上海夏間時間下午十一時），英內閣赴印代表團為答復印同教聯盟領袖及國大黨常務委員會之談話，發表第二次宣言。其要點可歸納如下：（一）在過渡時期中，（甚盼過渡時期將極為短促）英方對印度之安全，仍將負責，因此英軍暫不撤離印度。（二）臨時政府成立後，行政領導位置，均由印人充任，英文絕不侵害印度主權。</p>
<p>在另一方面，該項宣言表示英方所請求印方履行者計有兩點：（一）印方與英國締結協定，（二）保護少數民族。</p>
<p>〔路透社新德里廿五日電〕印度國大黨昨發表長二千字之決議，顯示該黨雖欲以和平合作方法，修轉印度之政權，但對於英內閣代表之建議，猶不能有最後之意見。國大會黨執委會決議全文之要點，即為臨時政府及最後之憲法，必須完全承認印度獨立之原則。凡有碍獨立之一切因素，必須立即除凈。譬如在完成新憲法以前，英軍仍駐在印度，即無異否認印度之獨立。</p>

<h3>英外相貝文在下院　為對埃政策辯護　駐兵他國領土認為已不合潮流　互助防衛蘇士運河在談判中</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦廿五日電〕貝文外相昨在下院為政府之埃及政策辯護稱，埃及問題為極困難之問題，政府經　密之考慮後，始有此項政策之決定。戰後之各國，無論大小均自認業已取得新地位，聯合國大小會中，亦均確認此項變遷。戰後已開始區域防衛之時代，不若前此之防務僅由一國單獨負責，彼等認為國家之安全，緊於區域防衛制度。余任外長以來，所接觸之國家均持此項信念。以言撤后問題，余覺軍隊駐在他國，無論如何為令人不愉快之舉，時至今日，尤覺不合潮流。故本人於修約談判之初，即建議履行吾人初入埃及時之諾言，即撤退軍隊是。吾人當先確定此一原則，然後再談如何代替佈防之問題。余覺此項諾言，為善意之表示，與其待諸他日被迫接受，不如即於今日由我先行提出。任何被外國佔領之國家，均不免具有自卑之心理，吾人初步務之一，即為消滅埃人此項自卑之心理。吾人已往與埃及之關係，不幸僅以少數人為對象，未曾顧及埃及一般人民之感情，而真正諒解之基礎，實擊於與一般人民之諒解。吾人當承認潮流已變，今非昔比，與阿拉伯國家保持聯擊，僅能以友誼為憑，不能再恃武力。回教待散佈在整個中東，直達印度半島，本人敢為斷言，自吾人改用信任回教民族之政策以來，我國在回教國之　譽，確已較前為增。以言防衛運河區一點，余敢向下院保證，撤兵以後，決將另籌妥善防衛辦法，並非就此不顧。余已代表英政府提出新建設，以達到相互防衛之目的，其意不但在保衛大不列顛及其共和邦之利益，最後更倚望能有助於聯合國機構之世界安全計劃。</p>
<p>會場混亂</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敦廿五日電〕下院昨辯論埃及問題時，英國政治兩大領袖人物員文外相及反對黨領袖邱吉爾，發生劇烈爭辯，一時秩序大亂，歷十餘分鐘始已。貝文與邱吉爾各站在長桌之一端。兩人之後，即為雙方之擁護者，後者歡呼叫罵，全場為之騷動。邱吉爾慶欲打　貝文之談話，貝文均不之許，議長高呼〔守秩序〕，亦無濟於事。後經外次麥克尼爾輕拉貝文衣襟，貝文始允邱吉爾發言，俄而擁護政府之一派又高呼邱吉爾不得學小學生之舉動，秩序又轉混亂，如是者久之，貝文始能繼續發言。</p>
<p>談判前途</p>
<p>〔路透社開羅廿五日電〕英外相貝文昨在下院宣佈埃及談判不致內頓挫而即停頓一項申明後，此問對修約談判前途曾抱悲觀之人，遂復寄以希望。埃國民黨現抓住艾登之建議，各黨皆應參加處理埃及獨立之談判。埃代表團某代表會謂，談判可望獲得圓滿結果，今所爭持者，乃英國欲取得實事上之一切便利。</p>

<h3>西北大學風潮平息　劉季洪校長送請辭職敎育部一再懇切慰留</h3>
<p>〔本報城固專訊〕西北大學校長劉季洪，前赴重慶向敎部商洽遷校問題，幷出席二中全會，三月中旬得悉該校少數學生，籍口自治會組織問題，鼓動罷課，爲期將近一月，學業損失極大，當即呈部辭職，未獲邀准，暫允返校處理風潮。</p>
<p>返校勸導</p>
<p>三月二十六日返校勸導，旋即全部復課。四月初，先後成立學生自治會指導委員會，決議對自治會指導辦法，以爲自治會問題旣有合理之指導，當可吿一段落，又二次呈部辭職，幷暫不到校辦公。該校全體敎職員問訊，當電請敎部朱部長挽留。學生各班代表大會亦決議挽留劉校長。旋敎部朱部長電復該校敎職員，並電致劉校長，囑勉任艱鉅，母再稍萌退志。</p>
<p>發生暴動</p>
<p>不料四月十五日，有少數學生發生暴動。當時約百人衝入校本部，勒繳校警武器，搶奪關防印章，强佔各辦公室，包圍校長，脅迫離校，幷擅出布吿，濫發宣言，又闖人法商學院，搶槍奪印。當晚該校院處長·系主任。及敎授代表，開緊急校務會議，當決定向校長總辭職，一致支持校長，與校長同進退，全體敎授亦簽名與校務會議諸同仁採取一致態度。校長離校後，學校頓成紊亂狀態。此輩學生擅說門崗，集體盤據禮堂，打開庫房，動用公物，遍貼荒謬標語，淆亂聽聞，刺傷同學，造成恐怖，事態之嚴重，行爲之慘毒，在學潮中實無前例。</p>
<p>羣起護校</p>
<p>惟多數純潔學生，以綱紀蕩然，校難日亟，莫不深表憤慨。當晚即自動集合，決心護校。十七日召開護校團成立大會，簽名護校之學生，即逾八百人，佔全校人數二分之一以上。十九日淸晨，護校團員分兩批出發，一批赴城內張貼標語，一批前往法商學院據守。校友總會亦積極協助。迨學校於法商學院舉辦登記時，除離校學生及少數不良份子外，均踴躍登記，總數達千人以上，（該校學生總數為一千一百十七人，）數十不良份子，盤據校本部，為期一週，終以無人同悄，而內部解體，遂於二十二日夜逃散。</p>
<p>依法究辦</p>
<p>就中二十名於二十三日就捕，當經移送法院，依法究辦。當此次風潮發生時，該校敎職員決議，一致支持校長，與校長同進退，幷向敎育部表示意見，當時部方覆電云：「城固西北大學趙院長幷轉諸先生，删電悉。該校風潮，已派督學周洪本，蔡若水，前往處理，並電劉校長速返校，査明爲首份子，從嚴懲處，即希協助校長，解決風潮，勿萌退志是盼。敎育部卯有。」現該校劉校長已返校，一切恢復常態，學期及畢業考試亦均如期舉行，正進行遷校事宜，師生精神異常團結，均盼劉校長繼續努力，發展校務云。</p>
<h3>首都臨大兩班學生　罷考潮可望解決　補習班已照常考試先修班將改日續考</h3>
<p>〔本報南京專訊〕南京臨時大學補習班與先修班學生，各有一部少數學生，爲要求分發問題罷考，同時亦脅迫其他同學同一舉動，以致不考試學生，與欲考試學生，形成對立，而補習班敎授，維護一般應考學生，措置得當，乃於二十四日下午，全體安然考試。先修班敎職員，連日與學生開會，從中斡旋，日內亦可望考試。茲將兩班情形分誌於下：</p>
<p>補習班</p>
<p>該班少數學生數十人，主張在分發問題未有圓滿解決以前，不參與考試，並欲脅迫全體同學，定於二十四日上午八時，在大禮堂開全體學生會。各敎授以大禮堂爲考塲，乃預先布置。不應考之學生數十人，本擬闖入禮堂，經敎授阻止，僅呼口號，謂應考學生無良心。應考學生在金大門前，未被不考學生阻擋得住，因各敎授與敎部所派督學丁顯曾，孫愛棠，陳宗英爲監考委員，到地向此輩少數學生，剴切訓導，學生有所感動。敎授會，並允許上午未參加考試之學生，可以補考。記者下午至該班先見有學生自治會吿白，云膳食問題已解決，分發問題已得敎授劉瑩代表敎授會之担保，（據敎授云，考試成績合格，自可担保分發），望上午未參加考試同學，前來登記，以便續考，繼見大禮堂考生鱗次櫛比，都在考試。敎部三位督學，往來於考塲監試，秩序極佳。據王書林主任聲述，上午八時有三分之二學生與考，中間經敎授之勸吿，學生表示接受，下午考試人數，更見踴躍，預計考試日程，至六月一日考畢，諒可始終其事。</p>
<p>先修班</p>
<p>該班學生，連日與試者六十餘人，其餘大多數欲考者，被脅迫未能應考。其不主張考者爲極少數。二十三日晚。敎職員對已經兩日考試之學生，主張自下星期一起，（二十七日）連同其他學生，全體一律考試，意在二十四日暫停考試工作，集中力量，再向罷考學生爲切實之開導。以期二十七全班考試。而連日已考六十餘學生，以爲同人冒危險，被唾駡，離開宿舍，而來應考，已有兩“，自應繼續考試，何能遷就未應考者。因此學生考之先後及考與不考，形成對立。各教授二十四日全日，爲此事與學生談話勸導，並於五時由該班主任羅益增，到敎部約同督學彭百川到班，與各敎授開會討論解決辦法。據一般觀察，補習班生旣已完全考試，先修班不日亦可續考云。（愚）</p>

<h3>答復讀者　法津質疑</h3>
<p>（一）朱步雲問　敝人從軍十年，因武漢淪陷而斷絕音訊，這次妻寄來一信說：前年因叙父之命，將大哥之子寄與你爲嗣，等語，茲有疑問數則，請指敎！（一）如前情可有法律效用？（二）倘有甩敵人退役之後，生育子女，其財產繼承應如何行使？（三）有否因　區或出征軍人之關係而不受上項拘束之單行法？（四）脫離是項關係，應舉行何種手續？</p>
<p>〔朱亞揆律師答〕（一）現行民法宗桃繼承已經廢止，故無嗣子名稱，至收養子女有配偶者，應共同為之，尊夫人為君收養，如未得同意，當然不生效力。（二）君將來生有子女，則繼承開始，其遺產當然由子女承受。（三）並無此項單行法。（四）終止收養關係，如具備民法一〇八一條所列之要件，應訴求法院裁判爲之。</p>
<p>（二）無錫忠實讀者問　某君年五十餘，於民廿八年身故，遺有房屋一幢，於三十年由其妻立據出賣，當時渠長子出身軍校，在前方參加抗戰，次子在家，幼子在中學讀書，均未在　簽字，現在兄弟三人對於此屋出賣，有否認之意，擬提出交涉：（一）老母出售乃父遺產，乃子均已法定年齡，未在塲簽字，可否提異議？（二）出售此屋，原議以田畝互換，後乃改付價款，以付款遲延，受物價高漲影響，損失頗鉅，現在可否追償？（三）得業人係佛敎信徒，憑藉惡勢力，有强迫簽字凌欺孤寡之嫌。現已將此屋拆除，改建佛敎運社社址，當時在敵僞期間無法申訴，現在交涉，從何着手？（四）渠長子現在軍政部任事，來函囑代登報警吿，幷提出異議，是否合法有效？</p>
<p>〔朱亞揆律師答〕（一）遺產爲公同共有，苟未得全體公同共有人之同意，其處分自不生效力。（二）契約旣不生效，根本談不到賠償損害問題。（三）訴求法院裁判。（四）應依法起訴解決。</p>
<p>（三）張豪問　敝鄕鄰女，已達法律年齡，出嫁三年，因夫婦意見不合，不能白頭偕老，乃於去冬出走，至今三月餘，隱匿他方，作某人　室，男方尋覓無着，近聞女方與戀夫請陳文舉律師代表聲稱虐待等情，向上海市地方法院起訴，請求離婚，被吿接得開庭傳票，即請辯護律師出席，第一庭開審，被吿並未到案，茲有數問：（一）雙方都居住靑邑，可否由上一海地方法院移交靑浦縣政府調解？（二）可否牽及原告之母與兄？（三）被吿能否向原吿及母兄賠償一切損失？</p>
<p>〔朱亞揆律師答〕所詢各節旣經起訴，且雙方均委由律師代理訴訟，自應靜候法院裁判，未便懸擬答復。</p>

<h3>同業公會　進一步的整理</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕工商各業團體之分類，本有部頒標準，可資依據，惟本市經濟界特別複雜，各業工會，又多有其悠久之歷史，一業以內，往往有數個團體，同時並存，其營業之對象，或單純，或繁複，又往往與部頒標準，不易吻合，勝利以後，社會局着手整理各民衆團體，一因手續太繁，未及分別整理，一因選舉關係，又不願多費時間，致妨礙選舉，故以上各種情形，依然未能消除，茲以選舉已過，而整理事務，亦粗可吿一段落，故定自明日起，按日召集各該團體，商議合理的合併或分析辦法，同時並邀請市商會派員參加，共同商討，以求折衷至當云。</p>

<h3>長春廿九天　（八）</h3>
<p>— 本報特約記者　邵傎之</p>
<p>我們八個記者既已失去自由，只好閉戶不出。共軍對於我們的「安全」顧慮，是否善意，我們還要看事實來證明，如共軍在我們住處放槍，以刺刀威脅等行為，不似上級有　意的命令交給他們，如所說的「保護」。新聞記者的神經都是相當靈敏的，我們密切地注意着新的變化。</p>
<h3>集體挨餓記</h3>
<p>共軍士兵與政治指導員隨便闖入　室，就是在工作的時候，也不斷來打擾。有事無事，總要你陪他談天，因為語言不通，麻煩不到五個美國同業身上，我們可麻煩透了。</p>
<p>芮克回來後，大家聽說要我們遷居，覺得這種變動不是有利的預兆，既然為了我們的「安全」，派槍保護之故，我們已經覺得很「安全」。遷居是沒有必要的。遷居到什麼地方我們也不知道，一方面覺得有些懷疑，另一方面也覺得泰然，因為我們很有理由拒絕他的提議。另一方面彼此自責，不要太神經過敏，把好意看反了，或者這不過是隨便說的話，不必引起無謂的疑慮。第二天大家就忘記了這回事。</p>
<p>我們在屋子裏找到一部蒸壽三國志和一部閱微草堂筆記，拿來消遣，各人的工作不過是寫一點Notes，看幾頁書，吃三餐飯，外面槍聲從未停止，每個美國同業都學會了「吃飯」和喊「小孩兒」，我們的小工友的準確發音，這是最重要的事。</p>
<p>下午劉其人來，說現在已經四點半，周保中原來請大家（芮克和他的駕駛員龐特也在內）在四點吃晚飯，和各位談談，現在過了半個鐘頭了。車子已在外面等着，請就上車吧。並且說，趙君遇市長也將被邀。劉其人因有事，不出席。</p>
<p>我們問他在什麼地方請吃飯，回答說是在大和旅館。周保中請吃飯的時間地點是事先沒有知道的。既是「宴談」，不免大家要刮一刮鬍子，擦一把臉，艾伯娜則要擦一點口紅，只得請劉其人等十分鐘。</p>
<p>劉其人向我們告別，我們分乘兩車直向大和旅館駛去，車上有共軍保護。司機的開到了另一家旅館，車上並沒有　導，竟開錯了地方。芮克原住大和旅館，看看距離不遠，便下車步行三四百公尺。大和旅館門口有幾個共軍守衛。我們下得車來，只見有一個保護我們來的共軍，用撕破的美國旗做着口罩，李普曼看了一陣之後，要想說話，但是語言不通，就止住了。</p>
<p>走進大和旅館，人影悄寂，全不似有宴客模樣。住客有塔斯社記者彼得洛夫還在那裏。他很自由。我們在樓上下跑了一轉之後，沒有見到一個人，雖然依照劉其人的說法，我們已過了時間，可是主人還沒有到。</p>
<p>芮克說大家可以到他房間裏去休息，我們告訴保護我們來的共軍，請他在周保中來後通知我們。</p>
<p>芮克的房間靠北窗，窗上有兩個槍彈洞，子彈打進墻壁。這是前幾天的戰蹟，芮克是十三日那天乘史汀生小飛機來的，駕駛員龐特和他住在一個房間裏，他們本擬到哈爾濱去，想不到擱住在這裏。現在這房間裏一起擠了十個人，不易轉身。等了一回，進來一們副官，說周司令忙，已經開車子回去接了。又等了一回，忽然送來由周保中署名的信，那信是給世間的，信上說：</p>
<p>「我認為您和其他美國記者諸先生都移居舊大和旅館較為便利。今天下午四時，應即遷移，但我這裏派去旅館的招待的人員沒有接着頭，故勞駕空於往返，現在還是請求您和其他美國記者一律移駕「大和」旅館為荷！」</p>
<p>變化來了，其實我們沒有空於往返，全在芮克房間裏等着，我們說：「周何中請我們來吃飯，而不是遷移，我們的東西也沒有帶，這件事希望在吃飯後再決定。」</p>
<p>副官說：「你們各人的房間已經準備好，你們先去休息，你們不必回去，東西可代搬來，我們把各位安頓好了，就去請他來。」</p>
<p>我們說：「不，在未得我們允許之前，什麼東西也不能碰。羅們現在需要見周保中。」</p>
<p>副官說：「可以不碰動，周司令完全是為了負責你們的安全，那魔你們對於這種好意表示什麼態度？」完全是威脅的口吻。</p>
<p>我們冷冷地說：「我們現在只準備來吃飯。」</p>
<p>「好吧，我再開車去找。」</p>
<p>隔了半點鐘後又來了一們共軍人員，說下面會客室裏已經準備好了茶點，請到下面去先用一點茶點再說因為知道各位，已經餓了。周司令立刻就來。這時芮克　到下面去看了一看，回來說並沒有茶點，副官則堅持請各人離開這裏，一下去就可準備好。大家煩躁極了，可是只得鎮靜極度忍耐。</p>
<p>李普曼這時躺在地板上，慢慢的爬起來，點起烟斗，說道；「按美國規矩，主人不到，客人不好先吃東西的，周司令員來，我們才好吃。」</p>
<p>芮克這時正和大家說着話，那副官又插進咀來，使芮克大怒：</p>
<p>「停咀！我正在和別人說話。」把對大家的話說完之後，對過來的副官說：「我是美國的外交官，你應該對我客氣些，你懂不懂：」</p>
<p>「懂」回答說：</p>
<p>「好，那麼我現在告訴你，」他看了一看錶，繼續說：「今天周保中將軍請客，可是我們這些美國孩子們已篈聞四個鐘頭了，我們都餓餓得不得了，我現在向你表示，我認為非常不高興，」芮克以美國官吏的資格，代表全體美國人提出了抗議。</p>
<p>我們中國記者則比較美國人更能忍耐，我們只希望能夠看到周保中，就可以同他直接交換意見，那位副官先看見我們不答應搬，又不答應到各個「已準備好」的房間去休息，已不答應到會客室去「吃茶點」，大家堅持說因為周保中請吃飯，要等這位主人，只是擠正芮克房間裏，做聯字游戲，貝克特躺在床上睡着了，一回兒艾伯娜也沒有了聲息，慎之，世洵，李普曼和駕駛員龐特躺在地板上，肚子餓得發痛，但是沒有一個人說肚子餓，沒有電燈，只有一枝蠟燭，光色黯淡，大家談些尋開心話，再不理那位副官。那位副官站了一會，自言自語道：「好，我再開車回去接回司令來。」</p>
<h3>午夜的一餐</h3>
<p>又繼續等了一個鐘頭的樣子，副官來了，說周保中已經在下面，請各位下去。</p>
<p>有的已經睡着了，一個一個喚醒，睡眼朦朧，不知已是什麼時候。大家如獲大赦，高高興興的跑下樓去。芮克最後一個走，好像是領他的。</p>
<p>我們走到二樓一個小餐廳，門口有一堆戰士，黑暗中看不清楚人數，大約是服護衛勤務的。餐廳的兩扇門只開一扇，我們走入門來，門口有一位中等身裁，但見他穿一套黑呢中山裝，長圓面孔，有不少缺點，在燭光下黝黝發亮，這就是現在的衛戊司令周保中將軍。</p>
<p>他和我們一一握手，彼此互通姓名。這餐廳內確已準備好了食物，而且是俄國西菜（大和旅館總是做這種西菜）。我們立刻就坐，周保中和艾伯娜坐在一頭，慎之和貝特坐在另一頭，其餘兩邊，一邊坐三個，一邊坐四個，如下圖：</p>
<p>席上大多是醃的食物，又冷又　，慎之和貝克特不等主人開口，首先動手吃　肉，吃完半盤之後，周保中站起來說開場白，說因為忙，今才能和諸位美國的朋友和中國的兄弟見面，非常高興，接着慰問大家的戰爭中受驚，但不說為什麼這頓「宴談」弄到深夜才舉行。我們舉杯喝伏特加，繼之換啤酒，吃　東西。</p>
<p>李普曼是一個促狹鬼，提議請艾伯娜代表全體向周何中敬一杯酒，大家讚成，可是艾伯娜來說：「我從小不喝酒，但是今天很高興會到了周將軍，愿意喝一杯。」</p>
<p>接着周介紹自己，說他是共產黨員，會經在北伐時任團長，打過南京。一九二七年後讀書，研究了一些問題。到過舊金山，莫斯科，他在舊金山獲得一個無線電，九一八事變前他到東北，十四年來從沒有離開過，他靠這個無線電收聽舊金山廣播，他所領導的抗日聯軍，雖然被日軍封鎖，甚至把武裝活動完全潛伏下去，却沒有能夠封鎖由美國來的世界的消息，十幾年來，今天初次看見美國朋友，美國在這次戰爭中供獻最大，因此要為美國和杜魯門乾杯，尤其是艾伯娜，遠涉重洋，從西方來到東方的美國婦女，他認為是英勇的，因此也要為美國婦女乾杯。</p>
<p>艾伯娜搖搖頭說：「不，一點不英勇，乾杯才是英勇的事。」</p>
<p>周保中認為我們中國記者是重要的，他們美國人終究是外人，中國人自己的事情，對他們無論如何是隔膜的。我們也乾杯。</p>
<p>肚子飢餓，却喝下冰冷的酒下去，極不舒服。肚子彷佛用刀割開，再吃　東西，彷彿再慘了一把鹽。</p>
<p>這時貝克特在慎之旁邊睡着了，呼呼發響。他曾自稱是一只貓，慎之和李普曼互扮鬼臉，但終於把他拉醒，此後一直把睛皮維持住不像睡覺的姿態，但他表情　　，呌別人替他難過。他偶有發悶的事，就持這種　　相。</p>
<p>芮克問周保中說他預備在東北打獵，不知可以獲得些什麼野獸。</p>
<p>周回答說：「東北多森林，野獸也很多，我們過去在被日軍圍困中，就常打獵果腹。」</p>
<p>艾伯娜問道：「老虎也打過嗎？」</p>
<p>「也打過。」這是回答。</p>
<p>周還說到打鹿的經難忘，說這個時候正是打鹿的時候，雄鹿生角，所謂鹿茸，出行時雌在前面，為的是保護雄鹿的角，到冬天鹿角長成，雄的就保護的了。接着談到野獸的種類和芮克的飛機，芮克的史汀生小飛機並沒有毀壞。</p>
<p>周對記者說，我們失去自由，完全是為了我們的安全，否則共產黨担負不起責任。他並且宣佈道：「民主聯軍在十九日正式佔領長春」。這次攻長春是周所指揮。關雅趣自己德惠以火車運兵的事，周的等答覆在上面「送別爾諾夫」一節裏已加載，周還說：「有蘇軍的地方我們就不去，生怕別人以為我們同他拉拷在一起，蘇軍曾經繳我們的槍，關係　得糟糕透了。」</p>
<p>這樣子亂七八糟的談了兩個鐘頭，快要散席，我們只等待聽最後的結論。我們在吃飯的時候，門口擁滿了共軍，餐廳裏也有七八個，結論終於來了周保中說：</p>
<p>「今天晚上，我希望你們就住在大和旅館，我們今後有什麼接頭的事情方便些，同時我們也不便另外派一部人去你們那裏保護，省得麻煩，大家覺得如何？」</p>
<p>大家立刻搖頭說：「不。」慎之拉拉貝克特，他的眼睛這時稍微張大了一點。</p>
<p>「那麼你們幾位中國兄弟呢」？</p>
<p>我們遂再搖一次頭說：「不。」於是周保中立刻問理由，以下就是我們的理由：</p>
<p>（一）原住的房子很舒服，宛如住在我們自己的家裏一樣。</p>
<p>（二）那裏有熱水，冷水，可以洗澡，有廚房做中國菜，廚司務從前是吳大帥的廚司，菜做的好極了。</p>
<p>（三）今天是應宴約，什麼東西都沒有整理，都隨隨便便的丟在那裏。</p>
<p>（四）我們也希望在我們自己的家裏回請你一次。</p>
<p>可是周保中猶疑了一回，說：</p>
<p>「恐怕你們的住處已經有了些變動吧？」</p>
<p>大家深覺這句話很希奇，但是說：</p>
<p>「我們相信不會。」</p>
<p>於是周保中答應送我們回寓所，我們請他在廿四晚八時到我們「家」裏去吃飯，他答應了，我們仍坐着他所派的汽車回寓所。正是十二時半，屋子裏的東西沒有一點變動。</p>
<p>我們又等於全班合演了一場戲</p>
<p>廿四日周保中並沒到記者寓所來。在下午五時接到他一封信，信上寫道：</p>
<p>「今晚六時我將離長春市赴四平街，明天可能回來，承中外記者各位先生盛意，晚八時賜宴，因要公爽約，請求原諒，俟由四平街返回時再趙謁候教，今天火車站有特務份子縱火焚燒一倉庫，協和會館地雷爆發，係僞軍鐵石部隊所埋設，市民觸發而生大災，昨晚接敝中央東北局轉來瀋陽美領事館訽芮克少校及美記，者諸先生之安全，其生活保證如何，弟亦就自己責任關係，覆我東北局矣，特此奉聞。」</p>
<p>廿五日晚上來了從八時起一直談到十二時半，帶來一位姓周的秘書，能懂英語，這是第一次帶譒譯的人來。後來才知道他是新華社記者是，新華社記者自然自由自在地工作着。</p>
<p>廿一日的上午，也正是我們送抗議書給周保中的那一天。了民服的劉隊長，他悄悄底走上樓來說：「我們小屋子裏的八路守衛，方才忽然都走了，我們埋在煤塊裏的槍，是不是要取出來？」他向世洵徵求意見。世洵把這個話譯給幾個美國同業，他們蜂擁似的，都奔下樓去。參觀為我們安全操過心的小屋子，只是裏面守衛的戰士，果真走得一個都沒有了，但見桌子上留下一塊塊堅如鐵石的大麵餅。</p>
<p>我們小翼翼地走出大門，但見聽四處在吹緊急集合號，同時西面又有忽疏忽密的槍聲，我們知道這又是「變」，貝克特走到樓上洋台的高處去看，但見許多的「八路」兵，槍上刺刀，向各處緊急的跑，跑的方向是從大同廣場出來。我們什麼都聽不見，在我們墻腳下急行的兩個八路，邊走邊嚷，一個說：「他媽的，又出水了」。「出水」兩個字是某一部份又遭攻擊的意思。</p>
<p>（未完）</p>
<h3>潯陽江頭</h3>
<p>— 九江十九日通訊　黎明</p>
<p>潯陽江頭，一陣陣的江風忙着迎送旅客，在每一個碼頭，每一個船上，都是經常地擠滿着來往的人們，在這裏有新來上任的達官，有榮歸故里的養民，還有垂頭喪氣被遺送回國的日俘，各式人等，紛至沓來。</p>
<p>市城南隅，有內外二湖：一為甘棠，一為南門，是本市唯一的風景區。兩湖中間有一小　橫隔，　上細柳隨風飄搖，湖水平明如鏡，湖旁是市區和原　環繞着。湖水祇是一片寂靜。　望山區，電燈有如漁火，在此情景下，最易惹引起人們無限的思憶。整個的甘棠湖，在沉默裏波動着。</p>
<p>九江——江西唯一的商埠，全省的咽喉，曾為我國三大米市和三大茶市之一。自從受着日寇的槯殘以後，經受了莫大損失。雖然，現在已有好些　員現狀，但非一個相當時期恐不能使它恢復舊觀。表面上看來，似乎商業還繁盛，實際上已遠不如昔。工業方面，簡直　謂具沒有工廠，僅有幾家小本工藝事業而已。</p>
<p>就拿本市唯一可營的瓷業來說吧：濱江路與靠碼頭一帶的正街，可說全部是瓷器店，數目當然是驚人的多，可是營業却是極為蕭條。即使到了船，有些店裏也還是冷冰地得不到顧客光臨。其餘的各種營業，亦異常清淡。雖然如此，但商人仍在苦鬥中。</p>
<p>九江自收復以來，特價之高漲大有蒸蒸日上之勢，米價是在收復後從兩三千元一石漲起，現已至三萬餘一石，其餘物價亦均漲至數倍甚至十餘倍不等，加之各種捐稅繁重，民眾無不呌苦連天。過境軍隊又多，糧食似有供有應求之勢，以至人民因斷炊而餓死者，時有所聞。近來腦膜炎亦已染入本市，病者頗多，　可謂貧病交迫。</p>
<p>談到文化界吧。九江亦將漸漸地踏上稪員之道。現在已漸漸地有了幾張小型報出現，當然，這不過是臨時的供應，將來應該有很大的增加與改進。勝利初期，書局一家都沒有，現在總算有了一兩家。學校機關亦漸漸地遷來，圖書館也已撐起了一所。這給予了九人民一個唯一的精神食糧倉醫庫。至於娛樂方面，電影聽說不久亦將有了，京戲院則祇一家，其他一切均開始踏入萌芽期。</p>

<h3>米價與公務員加薪</h3>
<p>主筆先生：歷史的寫照，現實的演變，都證明了一切人事上禍福的造成，不屬於正覺，即屬於錯覺，前者可以為福，而後者可以釀禍，即所謂一言興邦，一言喪邦，故報紙紀載，不可以不慎。其它姑勿論，即請以最近米價與公務員加薪兩點來講一講。</p>
<p>現在不論那種人物，提起米的問題來，都在下面照例加上幾句，如「來源缺乏」，「交通不便」，「生產未復」，「利息太高」。誠然，這都是經濟學上的公式說，不過我在前幾天的一個晚上，走過幾家米店時，看見它們的貨，堆得高達屋梁，翻過一夜來，就瘋也似的上漲了，第二天晚上走過時，仍是那樣，但翻過一夜來，又瘋也似的上漲了，第三天第四天的情勢，當然不用再說。請問上面的公式說，今代米老　擇那「」「」「」「」項，以符其上漲的理由？其實不過憑着上面公式說的幌子，常常　起　落的利用機會，來填暴利慾　罷了。總之，今日生活慘到如此，很多是人為上促成的。我又曾親眼見過，在某一次空氣動燙中，忽然馬路兩旁人行道上貨物，積如山阜，連喊帶　，簡直要硬把行人拉去作顧客之勢；等到風勢轉佳，已成了陵遷谷變之境。但前一日交通既沒有全復，後一日交通也沒有全斷，前一日工廠既沒有全開，後一日工廠也沒有全停，始終那些公式說，就是這樣被它們一直利用下去的。最近的不久，我們賢明的措施米貸金又出現了，結果由二萬四五千元的米價，同風箏斷了線，離開了本位，越飛越遠，終於收不回頭。而米商開會時，竟會這樣喊出來：「把米貸金取消，米就會便宜了」。即此可想其中的曲折。等到米貸金果真取消了，米價却又大漲而突漲！米貸金的政策，忽此忽彼，舉棋不定，在主持者錯覺的措施下，把好事弄糟了，福未觀，而息已深。</p>
<p>現在公務員的加薪是一個問題，而公務員的賢與不肖又是一個問題，不能混為一談。如係冗員，理應淘汰，如係不肖，理應斥革，如係　枝組織，理慶裁撤，監督固有所司，制裁更有法典。至於清廉辛苦不茍等等，這是為民公僕所應該的，如因此而加薪，這是通常制度中的考勤，而不是現在要加薪的問題。這是兩回事，不是一回事。現在加薪問題。是公務員的生活問題，也可說是生命問題，不應等到在下要求，是要在上的時為顧及，不要等到子弟餓得哭，父兄應隨時反省自己的義務。這不是人情，而是責任。如置死活為次要，工作應照常這就不知何以自圓其說了！枵腹讀書，枵腹從公，這是自勉的精神，不能責望於人人。如以甘苦同情，財力不夠為辭，此更非國鈞在握者，所應作的聊以解嘲的語調。至所稱加薪刺激特價一節，則最近薪尙未加，何以物價又漲到如此地步？我們現在不妨講得透澈一點，那裏是公務員要加薪，實在是公務員要求挽回在不斷的無形減薪。日前報上又有一位發表，主張裁員，即使不管三七念一，先裁到一半，留任的可馬上多獲一倍，是否即能維持生活，或以後是否物價即不再上漲，是否再漲時再　掉一半？物價如照現在的放任主　，當然要再漲，公務員的生活當然要再　重，生活再　　，當然再鬧加薪。可見這　辦法，在一方是可行的，但在另一方的生活問題，似乎還要考慮吧。</p>
<p>當局應趕緊樹立嚴厲管理生活品的有效辦法，否則一部份不肖商人，在此艱難的短時期內，決不會使走馬燈式的漲價加薪的賽跑停止下來。公務員身上最後一滴血與社會所餘的一點元氣，會代為一絲不　的吸進走馬燈的旋輪裏去。如果竟把半璧僅存尚好的都市，被它們一并拖下水，追上不堪的地獄之境，則「民族」之外，實不知何去解決「民權」與「民生」？當前急切的事態，不必奢談其他高論，敢請集中正確的認識，用有效的辦法，具完備的精神，只許正覺，不許錯覺，合力先來　好眼前一班生命上的險境。許惺　·五·廿一·</p>
<p>配給洋米未雨綢繆</p>
<p>主毛先生：本埠米價飛漲，大部份原因是人為的，是……與米　蟲上下其手，於中取利，以致鬧成如此現象。言之痛心。米貸本係政府好心，無奈辦理不得其法，徒資奸人從中營利，米貸發放一次，米價高漲一次，不知當局者撫心自問：對得起窮苦老百姓否？「治亂國用重典」，必須澈查，槍斃數人，方平民憤，無奈政府　寬大，寬大！寬大！寬大得國家不成樣子！東也舞弊，西也舞弊，直等同歸於盡，各方稱心！據貴報本月十九日所　，不久有大批洋米運到，是否事實，無從知曉，如果實有其事，請聯合各大報各團體，竭力　護　吳社會局長主張，利用保甲，以低廉價格配給市民食米，切不可再蹈覆轍，投入米商虎口，領十包配給米，責一半，留一半，囤之　利。蓋於今君子道消小人道長，一個有良心的主張，往往會被羣奸破壞，偕便私圖。所以須聯合各報各團體一致擁護　吳局長之主張，免被奸人破壞。再者各保甲長辦理配給貧米，須給以手續費若干，加入配米售價內，既可養廉，亦可使樂於從公者不致退縮。但有舞弊摻雜和水等等情事，一經查出或經告發，定行重辦，決不寬貸。（其辦法：令　長竹桿，掛一長布幡，上書舞弊保長，或甲長等字樣，鳴鑼遊行本市三天和本保三天，然後革職。）凡事預則立。果有洋米裝來，在未裝到之時，召集各方會議，以免臨時倉卒。否則雖有洋米濟民食，其如奸人米　，交相利用何！鄙人目下生活費用略有把握，為民請命，略貢　　。憂患餘生謹啓。五月廿日。</p>
<p>青浦征收出境米捐</p>
<p>主筆先生：不久以前，從青浦到上海與淞江水路必經要道的　　鎮，曾經向過境米商徵收過境稅，引起各方的反對，並且和船夫發生了衝突，於是這項擱稅也就無形消滅了，不料青浦縣當局最近又向米糧上面要錢了，在縣境各區分設建高事業促進委員會，如有出境米糧，每石須要繳納二升捐費，然後出給運糧證明書，此項捐費由米業代向販運客戶徵收。在此米價高漲聲中，我對於這項捐費，有幾點感想請教：（一）青浦各區建設事業促進委員會近向糧商徵收捐稅的成積，大有可觀，可是該會對於「建設」的事業和計劃，却一些沒有表現出來。倒底「建設」　什麼呢？至今還是個冰戎廬。（二）各區委員會的證明書上有這麼一句話：「希沿途巡查人員予以保護放行」，可是那「保護放行」的功効，却有些徵妙。我們有一位朋友，他到朱家角（青浦縣第二區）去採辦米糧，照樣繳納捐費拿到證明書，他的米船經過滬青公路崧澤村時，後面追上來幾位武裝同志，實施檢查，硬說他捐額不足，結果，送上去四斗糙米，方允許開行。所謂「保護放行」，原來如此！（三）每石米要捐二升，就是買米吃的小百姓要化一石米，豈不是增加了升斗小民的負担？我們一方面要壓平米價，一方面却在增加成本，這話真是從何說起！文生謹啓</p>

<h3>崑曲正重慶</h3>
<p>— 朱太痴</p>
<p>崑曲為東南產物，自有明中葉，至遜清乾嘉間，盛行全國，執簧典，而漸告式徵，惟江浙二省，流風餘韻，猶有存焉而已，四川僻在西陲，原有川腔，其聲尖銳，而詞雅飭，川人趨之若驚，外省人則嗜皮簧，至崑曲則知其名者已鮮，遑論傳習，迨坑戰時期，重慶不僅為政治經濟之中心，抑且為人文薈萃之所，於是有嫻於斯道者，相與糾集同志，組織曲社，於公餘之暇，迭相唱和，以維斯道於不墜，甚盛事也，最初有渝社之組織，民三十年改組為重慶曲社，綱羅羣彥，一時稱盛，除按月舉行同期雅集外，並會在國泰劇院，銀行俱樂部，江蘇同鄉會等地，幾度公演，於四方多難聲中，得聞此鈞天雅奏，殊屬難能可貴，故每次擺弄，頗博好譽焉，至曲壇人物，則實業家穆藕初以此道中斷輪老手，提栔後進，與致不減當年，惜旋以癌疾不起，陪都曲友有木壞山頹之感，熱心提倡與藕初相伯仲者，有范崇實何靜源二君，二君屬川籍，　　　　　　　於時，且雅有學問，因　曲成癖乃潛心學習，　數年而　大成，范工老生，何曾冠生，雖音吐為方音所限，而口勁老練，無殊老曲家，其餘曲家，如項遠村聲吾昆仲，張充和允和姊妹，徐炎之張善薌伉　，丁趾祥錢一羽程禹年沈可莊甘　三王道之王子建諸子，原已名噪京滬譽滿曲壇，茲以異鄉重逢，益增應求之感，其中綰曲社重心者，為倪宗楊姚聲　二君，蓋二君原為仙霓社弟子，今雖改業，而平時習拍排練，臨時場面，非二君莫屬，至　笛則除二君外，徐君炎之甘君貢三及項氏昆仲，有時亦能分共勞，此外，風聲所播，篤學君子，名門閏秀，踵門來學者，頗不乏其人，不及備載，以故抗戰八年間，陪都首善之區，崑曲亦曾不脛而走，成為一時風尚，使各省人士胥能欣賞此僅有之國樂者，重慶曲社諸子之功也，迨至勝利來臨，復員聲中，重慶曲界中人風流雲散，盛會不再，可勝慨哉，聞倪君宗楊尚留渝未歸，主持風雅，倪君殆將獨任其艱矣。</p>
<p>劇評</p>
<h3>觀「楓林劇團」首次公演</h3>
<p>— 吳萍</p>
<p>「楓林劇團」這名字在讀者的腦中，似乎很陌生。的確，事實上「楓林劇團」並未在任何戲院劇場演出過。它並非職業劇團，亦非業餘劇團，而純是一般學生們所組的課餘劇團。</p>
<p>「楓林劇團」是臨大農科學生所主辦，它們創辦還不久，不過每同學都肯苦幹努力，所以在十八日的下午，終於在楓林橋該校宿舍內「楓林劇場」和觀眾首次見面。而且演出成績，非常美滿。</p>
<p>這次演起籌備，是相當艱難的，他們沒有充分的經濟力，一切道具，都是設法借來的。據說前台主任袁君，為它幾夜沒好睡</p>
<p>全部入場券均係贈送，且對號入座。故觀眾大都是同學們的親友，秩序也很良好。預定開演時間是午後七時正，然而因為化裝上以及種種關係延展了二小時。九時許在觀眾的熱烈掌聲中揭開了序幕。</p>
<p>這次的演出是三個獨幕劇，第一個是田漢編的「蘇州夜話。」內容是：一個老書家受戰爭的洗禮，毀滅他的家庭和全部藝術作品，其後，他曾拿過槍桿，但結果仍掮起了他的書筆，並且帶了學生到蘇州去寫生。在蘇忽過失散的女兒，已淪為賣花女。當他更得悉老妻因貧窮而告別人世後，悲喜交集，抱緊了重逢的女兒，不禁深深咒詛着戰爭和貧窮的罪惡。</p>
<p>第二幕「未婚夫妻」是陳白　所編。敘述一對已訂婚而未結婚的男女，隨抗戰遷內地，男的因房東不肯租屋於單身人而托言已婚。女的欲因公司裏不用已婚女子之故，而揚言未婚。適其時，女的上司來訪，與房東為這對男女已未婚問題而起爭執，於是趣劇展開了。</p>
<p>田漢編製的「湖上的悲劇」於最後演出，一個多情青年詩人在西湖畔重逢自殺未遂的舊情人。然而當女的知對方已有妻子，深深失望後，不願破壞愛人的幸福家庭而毅然再度自殺。</p>
<p>其上三幕劇本的編製上，早有好譽在先，不必多為嚕　。現在所要置評的是在「楓林劇團」的演出方面，大致上說，全部是成功的，每個演員以及工作人員都肯努力。尤其是道具，燈光，化裝上的適當，是相當不易的了</p>
<p>再說演技方面，毫無舞台經騐的學生，初度合作演出，毫不怯場，反顯出很老練的演技和酷似的表情，是值得贊美的。其中只有一二演員發音太輕，以及有幾句台詞，在急忙中說錯或漏掉，不過我們不能以些微的綴點來抹殺全部的成績。</p>
<p>最後，我們以最大的誠意，期待着「楓林劇團」每個有希望的演員工作人員，不斷的繼續努力，更盼在最近期內能再見得一次更為滿意的演出。</p>
<p>劇作介紹</p>
<h3>「舊恨新愁」</h3>
<p>— 何為</p>
<p>劇作者：陶熊</p>
<p>出版者：文江圖書公司</p>
<p>記得民國三十年的時候，當陶熊的處女作「反間諜」在重慶發表以後，曾經由各地的劇團普遍上演，很受一般觀眾的歡迎。時隔五年的今日，才做到他第二部作品四幕悲劇「舊恨新愁」的單印本在上海發行。這一個劇本的內容技術，對話，人物的刻劃，結構和情節，都比「反間諜」好。題材也合時，是描寫抗戰前的舊情侶，在八年抗戰中各分東西，待勝利歸來再見，已非當年情境，只有徒增愁恨而已。當我讀完，感想頗多，印象很深，也很感動。故特介紹於讀者！</p>
<p>影片介紹</p>
<h3>一九四五年度　十大名片</h3>
<p>— 亞青</p>
<p>美國的每日電影報紙，在每年總有一次盛大的選舉。聘請了幾百位　定的代表和各報紙各雜誌的影評人聯合地鄭重投票，推選出最完美的十大名片來，以　勉並嘉獎這般影片的導演，編劇，演員及工作人員們。</p>
<p>去年一九四五年已是實行選舉的第二十四個年頭了，這歷史可以說是已經很悠久。在最近的五年中，他們所列入冠軍的巨片，因戰事的關係，未能如期地給影迷們知曉。在此我亦把片名附帶地報告給諸位讀者：一九四〇年「蝴蝶夢」，一九四一年「亂世佳人」，一九四二年「忠勇之家」，一九四三年「胡亂的收獲」“Random　Harvest”一九四四年「聖殿雄歌」“Going　my　Way”。前面三片已在上海先後放映，後面二片還未曾映過。</p>
<p>至於一九四五年度的十大名片，現在讓我一一地介紹給讀者如後：</p>
<p>（一）威爾遜總統傳——二十世紀福斯公司出品彩色傳記片，不久前上海剛映過。完成於一九四四年八月二日。</p>
<p>（二）波城世系“A　tree　grows　in　Brooklyn”二十世紀福斯出品。</p>
<p>（三）王國的關鍵“The　keys　of　the　kindom”二十世紀福斯出品。本市美琪大戲院將映。</p>
<p>（四）決斷谷“The　Valley　of　Decision”米高梅出品，葛麗亞嘉遜主演的文藝片。</p>
<p>（五）一曲難忘“A　Song　to　remember”哥倫比亞出品彩色音樂傳記片，保羅茂尼·曼兒奧勃朗·康納惠特三大明星主演。</p>
<p>（六）羅位“J.aura”二十世紀福斯出品，　　　　主演。</p>
<p>（七）小　　　　攼事“The　story　of　GJ　Joe”聯美公司發生的戰爭片。</p>
<p>（八）夾秀黍離“The　Corn　is　Green”華納公司出品，蓓蒂黛維絲主演的文藝片。</p>
<p>（九）國家天鹅絨“National　Velvet”米高梅公司出品彩色　馬片，米蓋羅納主演。</p>
<p>（十）水手奇遇“Anchors　Aweigh”米高梅彩色歌舞片，萬眾歡騰原班人馬合演。</p>
<p>因為他們選舉的影片是自上一年的十一月一日起至下一年的十月三十一日止所正式開映於美國的戲院為標準，所以「聖瑪麗亞的鐘聲」及「失去的週未」兩片未及列入，而「威爾遜總統傳」列入一九四五年度的影片即是此故。</p>
<p>影城消息</p>
<h3>「伊甸園」</h3>
<p>— 華</p>
<p>「伊甸園」是最近轟動影城的一張新片，但送審檢查時將會發生不能通過的困難。</p>
<p>該片與近在大上海放映之「聖瑪麗亞之鐘聲」為同一製片人——倪奧麥開萊，近據彼談稱：「該片不能真關依照聖經原著故事拍製，雖然聖經中曾有數段敍述：」我們知道亞當與夏娃從未想到穿着衣飾的事，直等到夏娃偷食智慧果後，」但檢查處却說不着衣服就不准拍片。」</p>
<p>「演員亦作同樣表示，該片原定殷格　褒受及詹姆史都華分飾此人類之二始祖，但史都華拒絕受聘，因其滕頭皮膚生瘤，不能拍攝此種影片。」</p>
<p>「公司曾思及用豹皮團腰，但聖經中亞當從未於伊甸園中刺殺任一野獸，有人提議以無花果樹葉製遮　，因樂園中具有此樹，但仍不欲如此嘗試。」</p>
<p>「無花果樹葉邊續　曲，編結後鬆散分開，極為適合此種用途，但此種形式如何能使褒曼小姐工作？」</p>
<p>麥氏為宗教片之巨孹，現以三百英畝建成伊甸園並畜野獸數百頭，更由歷史專家研究設計解決服飾問題。</p>
<h3>影業霸王米高美公司</h3>
<p>— 新鳴</p>
<p>只不過二十多年的歷史好萊塢在名聲方面，在製片的認真方面，在明星的發掘方面，無論那一處，米高美公司總是前驅者，領導者，是整個好萊塢的「托辣司」，然其發達原因大半亦得力於他們的經理魯易斯梅郁，他手段的高明，幹事的能幹，成績卓著，所以美國前途雜誌去年的電影經理人將看就被他得到了，祝賀他的成功。</p>
<p>同時你祇須着一九四五年度米高美一張整齊的「卡斯脫」——他們都是一個個從梅郁的手中提拔起來，米高美公司現擁有男女台柱共計二十名之多，其名單如下：范喬生，米蓋羅納，勞勃泰勒，史本塞屈賽，克拉克蓋博，金凱萊，華雷斯皮萊，華德畢動，威廉鮑威爾，勞勃蒙高茂來。葛麗亞嘉蓀，裘蒂加倫，凱塞玲葛雷蓀，瑪格莉奧勃林，赫本，華妮。而一九四五年度十大賣座明星中，為米高美的明星竟佔了五位，每一個影迷都得嘆為觀止無可否認，為米高梅公司的確不愧為好萊塢的霸王，更可稱得上全地球電影事業的霸王了。</p>
<p>今年魯易斯梅郁更發表地熱烈的希望，他說：「我們好像是賽跑的小馬當一九四二年之時候，面一九四五年我們還是全美的第一駿馬的馬厩，所以今年還得找尋我勻的好馬來填補，爭取第一。」可見他是如何地謙虛，毫不自大，因此他就能得于歸了的明星了。</p>
<p>最後我來介紹幾張米高美一九四五年度最佳的幾張影片，以便影迷們的選擇，莫錯過了佳片，一，決斷谷葛麗亞嘉蓀主演的文藝片，二，水手奇遇“Anchols　Aweigh”萬眾歡騰原班人馬合演的五彩音樂巨片，三，國家天鵝（Nationnal　Velvet）米蓋羅納主演五彩寫賽馬片，四，聖魯易士的相逢（MeetMe　In　St.Louis）裘蒂迦倫，瑪格莉奧勃林合演五彩歌唱片。</p>
<h3>短命的歌舞女星</h3>
<p>— 亞鳳</p>
<p>電影明星的事業往常總受年齡的限制，尤其是銀幕上的歌舞女郎，她們的「事業生命期望」祇有三年到五年。</p>
<p>哥侖比亞公司的舞蹈導演賈柯爾（Jack　Cole），他的愛人是一個歌舞隊裏的女孩子，她在廿一歲後就離開那兒了。</p>
<p>柯爾說：「銀幕上的歌舞女星十分之九是十八歲與廿一歲之間，幾幾乎可以斷定，在好萊塢沒有人過了廿五歲的。這句話當然不適用於特別的舞蹈家，那她在卅歲後甚至四十歲後亦能跳舞，像藝術節目這樣表演」。</p>
<p>柯爾以為歌舞女郎事業生命短促的致命傷是為了觀眾歡迎她們的「新奇」和嬌艷」，而這種「新奇」和嬌艷，經過嚴厲的排演日程又往往迅速的消逝了。</p>
<p>「自有五彩影片以來，年輕女郎的需要更大」。他說。為了解明這話，柯爾提及，在音樂劇The　Story　of　Jolson（以Jolson的生活作基礎的）中，他所容納的女明星幾乎都在廿歲以下。</p>
<p>「像這種五彩影片，因為有不少關於女明星的個別的特寫鏡頭，使年齡的平均數愈形降低。」舞蹈導演說。</p>
<p>許多女郎在十五歲到十七歲這時候已適宜舞蹈了，不過十八歲以前她們都還得進學校，因為公司裏明星或特殊的賞輔助他們進入學校。</p>
<p>「但是別替她們短暫的事業生命可惜」，柯爾帶着　戒的口吻；「因為她們自己就不覺得可惜。實際上在影片上她們是最幸福的。她們中間幾乎沒有人需要事業，她們要的祇　是丈夫，而亦似乎都獲得理想的人兒」。——原刋四月二日的上海自由西報</p>
<h3>影人動態</h3>
<p>名劇「玉麒麟」編者宗由，改任編導後，仍不時參加演戲，担任「老生」，現為另謀新發展，返抵南京，籌組一新劇團，擬先在京公演一劇。</p>
<p>以演「老生」成名之名演員孫堅白，現已正式脫離「中製」，加入「劇專校友劇團」，日內即可抵京，將協助王瑞麟氏排演三四劇，以備赴滬杭平津一帶作旅行公演。</p>
<p>國立戲劇專科學校復員，決定遷返南京，自六月半起，員生自費者，可先行東下，九月半全校遷京，預定年底前在京復課。</p>
<h3>家庭娛樂</h3>
<p>— 淚雲</p>
<p>娛樂是天性的，也是人類生活中的一種權利。可是我國人一向不注意及此。餘暇的時間，除了打打牌開開無線電之外，絕無正常娛樂。這，其實也是家庭中一種極嚴重問題，不能不注意。</p>
<p>娛樂要正當，以不妨害首先，並應有增加知識，顧全康健，而有帶趣味性者為尙。</p>
<p>吃奶或二三歲的孩子，在他的玩具選擇中，應以高尙整潔為主。如美麗的洋娃娃，彩色的畫片，發聲小樂器，能　成他有意議的感覺，切忌用木偶，觀世音彌勒佛之類導誘着迷信的印象。</p>
<p>至於六七歲至十二三歲的兒童，在家庭中玩玩拍球·踢鍵子·跳縈兒·也是提倡正常的運動。做父母的應節省些金錢，為兒童　置些小朋友讀物，充他們課後飯餘閱讀。一個美好而高尙的家族。切忌兒童看無聊的連環圖書。或放縱兒童站在桌邊看打牌。或與小朋友打彈子，旋糖吃，以及一切類似賭博的游戲。</p>
<p>十四五歲以上的青年，應發　他正當的嗜好，或是集郵，能於郵局中推敲各國各地的風土人情，以及歷史性的圖案。或是喜歡音樂者，教他們練習歌詠識，五線譜，或簡單的樂器如口琴風琴之類。再有愛好美術者，給他們一些習畫的範木以及畫具之類，使從事摹仿與探討。孩子如果想參加戶外運動。如足球·球綱籃球·划船·游泳之類，為父母者，不應禁止。</p>
<p>成年人在家中，似乎沒有娛樂吧！不，喜歡閱讀的人，可訂定些有益的書報，一面作消遣一面求知識，使自己的思想，能追隨時代並進，不至落伍而成頑固。有人喜歡習字，有人喜歡寫書，有人喜歡治印，雖不望成為名家，而娛樂之意，即在其中矣！　花·養鳥·也是適宜的娛樂，只不要每晨看花二小時，家中養鳥七八頭，玩物成了喪志，並失却娛樂的意義了。</p>
<p>女孩子和女太太們沒有娛樂吧！不，女人專長的是女紅烹調，能在作女紅時，　　精緻，別出心裁；或在烹調時，注意美味，製成名肴，這樣可謂寓娛樂於工作了。對家庭的佈置，用具的安排，一個有美術觀念的女子，在動手工作時，也會感到興趣。</p>
<p>上海的女子打牌，是娛樂中最要不得的一種，假如聽無線電，也應揀其高尚的音樂，有益的演講，以及啓發知識的教育播音。如專聽低級趣味的胡鬧，迷信的鬼話，那連收聽者的思想也自然趨卑汚，誠無益而有害也。</p>

<h3>Guo-Gong (KMT-CCP) Reopen Political Negotiations; Both Sides Express Willingness to Promote the Realization of Ceasefire and Transportation Resumption</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Nanjing 25th Dispatch] Striving for a comprehensive peaceful ceasefire and negotiations on restoring transportation have become concrete after several meetings between Special Envoy Marshall, Yu Da-Wei, and Zhou Enlai. On the morning of the 25th, Zhou Enlai, upon invitation, went to No. 5 Ninghai Road to continue discussions with Envoy Marshall on the government's important precondition of promptly restoring transportation on the Jinpu (Tianjin-Pukou) and Pinghan (Beijing-Hankou) Railways to save the more than ten million distressed refugees in northern and southern Henan. It is also heard that representatives from both the Kuomintang (KMT) and the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) will hold sincere discussions this afternoon to resolve various important issues concerning the current ceasefire, transportation resumption, and reopening of the Political Consultative Conference (PCC). It is said that the opinions of both sides are closer than before, but the CCP is still considering the restoration of transportation on the Jinpu and Pinghan Railways. It is also rumored that the CCP delegation is urgently telegraphing Yan'an for instructions to cope with the current new situation.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Nanjing 25th Dispatch] The door to KMT-CCP negotiations reopened today. At 5 PM, government representatives Shao Lizi, Wang Shijie, and Zhang Lisheng, along with CCP representatives Zhou Enlai, Dong Biwu, and Lu Dingyi, as well as PCC Secretary Lei Zhen, held a historic meeting in the reception room of a small Western-style house at No. 8 Jingzhi Road, Langya Road, in the capital. It is said that the meeting lasted nearly three hours.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Nanjing 25th Dispatch] Political negotiations, which had been dormant for a long time, have now reopened. Government representatives invited CCP representatives to a meeting at Secretary-General Shao Lizi's residence at No. 8 Langya Road at 5 PM today. This is likely the first formal negotiation between government and CCP representatives on issues related to the PCC after the return to the capital. Government representatives Wang Shijie, Shao Lizi, and Zhang Lisheng, and CCP representatives Zhou Enlai, Dong Biwu, Lu Dingyi, and Secretary-General Lei Zhen all attended. It is reported that today's meeting involved an exchange of views on three issues: cessation of military conflict, restoration of transportation, and cessation of mutually provocative propaganda. Finally, both sides expressed their willingness to work hard to achieve these goals as soon as possible.</p>
<p>[United Press Nanjing 25th Dispatch] The political stalemate of the past month has shown a glimmer of hope for resolution tonight due to the informal exchange of views between representatives of the Kuomintang and the Communist Party.</p>
<p>[Associated Press Nanjing 25th Dispatch] Senior officials from both the KMT and the CCP held talks at Shao Lizi's residence today. This is the first formal negotiation of its kind between the KMT and the CCP since the National Army recovered Changchun.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Local Dispatch] Wu Tiecheng, Secretary of the Central Party Headquarters, arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing the night before last. Yesterday, he met with reporters and said: "This trip is for a weekend holiday to rest in Shanghai and take care of personal matters. I will return to Nanjing in two days and have not met with any parties." When reporters asked about his views on the current overall situation, Wu expressed great optimism. He said: "The government and all parties and the people equally hope to achieve peace, unity, and solidarity. Recently, the National Army recovered Changchun, which is the recovery of sovereignty. This is of course very beneficial to the overall situation, but whether it can break the stalemate in negotiations for the realization of thorough peace and unity depends entirely on the second step of the CCP's actions."</p>
<h3>National Army Advancing Towards Haji; General Sun Liren Sympathizes with Suffering People</h3>
<p>[United Press Peiping 25th Dispatch] According to authoritative sources today: The National Army under General Du Yuming, after occupying Changchun, is reportedly advancing towards Harbin. The National Army encountered some resistance from the Communist forces under Lin Biao and has now crossed 25 miles beyond Changchun.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Fanyang 25th Dispatch] Zhao Chen, commander of the 91st Division of the 71st Army, was wounded in the head while leading his troops in battle during the fierce fighting at Taipingcen, Lishu, on the 17th, and has been sent to Shenyang for treatment. Lishu is the location of Lin Biao's headquarters. Taipingcen has a dangerous terrain, and the fortifications built there are extremely strong, with several layers of deep trenches. The National Army only managed to recapture it after three days of fierce fighting.</p>
<p>[Associated Press Peiping 25th Dispatch] After Du Yuming's troops cleared the remaining Communist forces from Changchun, they continued north along the railway line towards Harbin today. Liu De, commander of the Second Security Brigade, reportedly escaped a few hours before Changchun was captured by the Communist forces on the 18th of last month. Liu and approximately 1,000 other National Army officers and soldiers were surrounded by the Communist forces at the Datong Assembly Field headquarters in Changchun. Liu personally led 100 men to repel the Communist forces before breaking out of the encirclement.</p>
<p>[United Press Gongzhuling Military Headquarters 24th Dispatch] (Delayed) Lieutenant General Sun Liren, commander of the New First Army, stated: "The Chinese civil war may end in Changchun because the government forces, after occupying this northeastern capital, 'will halt their advance and await instructions.'" Speaking at a meeting hosting journalists from the United States, France, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, and China, Sun said: "We hate civil war. We fought the Japanese for a long time, and the people suffered deeply. If these people (implicitly referring to the Communist Party) have any conscience, they will not want to destroy the country and put the people in a more miserable situation." General Sun attacked the poor discipline of the "Soviet Allied Forces" during the occupation of the Northeast. He said: "Soviet troops raped Northeast women over the age of twelve. The Soviet 'Allied Forces' dismantled and took away all the best vehicles, locomotives, and industrial equipment. Compared to the development of industry in the Northeast by the Japanese, there is a huge difference in the Soviet Union's plunder." General Sun's troops have been feeling the shortage of military supplies since the end of Lend-Lease. Now they are practicing thrift. The New Sixth Army, which participated in the India-Burma campaign and was equipped with American equipment, is in the same situation.</p>
<p>[United Press Changchun 24th Dispatch] By noon today, the entire urban area of Changchun was in the hands of the National Army. The people enthusiastically cheered and welcomed the American-equipped New First Army as it entered the city. The people also cheered the journalists who arrived here today from Sipingjie. Changchun itself suffered little damage from the war. Water, electricity, and telephones in the city are still available as usual. Several light locomotives and about 200 vehicles at the station were not destroyed by the Communist forces. The main force of the National Army column has advanced ten miles north of Changchun.</p>
<h3>Chairman Jiang Inspects Tiexi Factory District in Shenyang</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Peiping 25th Dispatch] Chairman Jiang, in Shenyang, summoned Sun Yueqi and inquired in detail about the situation of taking over various large and small factories. He also personally ordered that preparations be actively made for the resumption of work in the factories and that business be restored quickly. After receiving the order, Sun is stepping up preparations for the start of work in the factories. His return to Peiping and going to Nanjing has been postponed. Also, it has been said that Marshal Marshall will fly to Shenyang, but this has not been officially confirmed.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Shenyang 25th Dispatch] Chairman Jiang took a car to inspect the Tiexi factory area for a week at 4 PM on the 25th, and then went to the Eastern Headquarters and the Northeast Security Commander's Headquarters for inspection. At 9 PM, he met with Commander-in-Chief Sun and others.</p>
<h3>U.S. Giant Aircraft Presented to Chairman Jiang</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Washington 24th Dispatch] The U.S. War Assets Administration announced today that the United States is presenting Chairman Jiang with a surplus Douglas C-54 four-engine transport aircraft, as recommended by the U.S. State Department.</p>
<h3>Two Soviets Killed in Changchun; National Army Takes Emergency Measures</h3>
<p>[United Press Changchun 24th Dispatch] Two Soviet citizens were killed here today by Chinese rioters during a mass riot. This act reflects their resentment towards the actions of the Soviets before the National Army recovered Changchun. The National Army immediately took emergency measures, moving the 160 Soviet citizens residing in Changchun into the Yamato Hotel, where five American journalists were detained half a month ago, and warned them that the National Army could not be responsible for their safety if they ventured out of the hotel. The killings occurred while the National Army was still conducting mopping-up operations in the city.</p>
<h3>Lu Dingyi's Statement</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Nanjing 25th Dispatch] Lu Dingyi of the CCP delegation issued a statement saying: "The withdrawal of the Democratic Allied Army from Changchun was carried out in accordance with orders prepared by Yan'an." Observers here believe that Lu's statement was issued to save face for the "Democratic Allied Army." Moreover, this statement is too late. Observers further pointed out that if the purpose of Lu's statement is to explain that the CCP will automatically withdraw from various areas in the Northeast that the government has already taken over but were occupied by the Communist forces, such as Harbin, Qiqihar, etc., and will not hinder the government's actions to recover sovereignty, then it depends on whether Yan'an will also order a withdrawal from these areas, which can be tested by facts.</p>
<h3>Yang Chuo'an, Peng Jiqun, and Others Leave Vladivostok for Shanghai Yesterday; Personnel for Northeast Takeover Stationed in Peiping Depart for Shenyang</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Peiping 25th Dispatch] According to a source: Yang Chuo'an, Mayor of Harbin, Peng Jiqun, Chairman of Nenjiang, and more than 40 takeover personnel withdrawn from Changchun, are scheduled to take a ship from Vladivostok to Shanghai today. Yesterday, Yang and others telegraphed relevant parties here that the current Mayor of Changchun, Jun Mai, and the acting Chairman of Jilin, Wang, were likely taken away by the Communist forces withdrawing from Changchun.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Shenyang 24th Dispatch] It is heard that the central personnel formerly stationed in Changchun have been taken to Jilin by the Communist forces. Xiong, Director of the Northeast Provisional Headquarters, has specially ordered Shang Chuandao, Director of the Civil Affairs Department of the Jilin Provincial Government, to concurrently serve as the Mayor of Changchun. Shang and his party of seven, including Secretary-General Liu Shougang, are scheduled to take a special train to Changchun on the 25th to take office.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Otsu 25th Dispatch] More than 100 personnel from various central ministries and commissions stationed in Peiping for the Northeast takeover took a train from Peiping to Shenyang via Tianjin on the morning of the 25th.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse Changchun 24th Dispatch] A group of foreign journalists arrived here from Sipingjie and Gongzhuling. The people held Kuomintang party flags to welcome them and shouted "Ding Hao (very good)". The people of Changchun, upon hearing that the National Army had arrived, were extremely elated and went out in the rain to welcome them.</p>
<h3>Gu Weijun Flies to Peiping; Will Inspect Northeast</h3>
<p>[Associated Press Nanjing 25th Dispatch] Gu Weijun flew to Peiping with Pauley today and will inspect the Northeast in the coming days. Thirteen years ago, Gu accompanied the Lytton Commission, dispatched by the League of Nations, to investigate. He has always been an authority on the Northeast issue, and the report he submits to the central government this time will certainly be very influential.</p>

<h3>Legislative Yuan Meeting Passes Bills to Abolish Wartime Military Laws, etc.; Urges Premier Song to Report on Financial and Economic Policies</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Nanjing 25th Dispatch] The 300th meeting of the Fourth Legislative Yuan was held in Nanjing at 9 AM this morning. Sixty-six legislators including Sun Jiulu, Hong Rui, Lou Tongsun, Jian Guansan, Chen Xun, Chen Chang, Chen Haizheng, Tan Wu, etc. attended. Chairman Sun Ke first had the Secretary-General of the meeting report on the minutes of the previous meeting and the five items including the instructions of the National Government that the China-Ecuador Friendship Treaty should be approved, and that the Executive Yuan has been ordered to instruct the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to handle it as usual. Then, the discussion began, and the following motions were passed: (1) Draft amendment to the Organization Law of the Ministry of Communications, (2) Draft regulations on the organization of the National Border Culture and Education Center (Huang Youchang, Lou Tongsun, Zhao Naichuan, and others had some extensions on the word "Borderland"), (3) Reply approving the abolishment of the Military Law of the Republic of China during wartime, (4) Reply approving the extension of the Regulations on Handling Cases Involving US Military Personnel in China for one year, (5) Reply approving the abolishment of the Regulations on the Management of Nitrate and Sulfur, (6) Review of the 12th supplementary budget of the ordinary national expenditure of Xikang Province for the 34th year of the Republic of China, (7) Review of the operating budget of the Steel Allocation Plant under the Ministry of Communications for the 35th year of the Republic of China. B. Items retained: (1) Draft Regulations on the Organization of the Capital Police Department. The reason for the retention is that committee members such as Tan Tianxin raised that the current police district system implemented in various places is related to this case, and it was then decided to discuss it together with the case of the Police General Administration, and submitted it for review, and discuss at the next meeting, (2) Draft Regulations on Unified Commodity Tax, (3) Draft Regulations on Domestic Tobacco and Alcohol Tax. The reason for retaining the above two cases is that the items of goods subject to the commodity tax have not been perfected, and should be submitted for review again, and the items should be increased before revision. C. Temporary motion: (1) The Legislative Yuan resolved at the last meeting to request Premier Song of the Executive Yuan to attend the regular meeting to report on financial and economic policies. Premier Song replied that the financial and economic situation after the war is complicated, and asked for the items to be opened to provide written answers. However, the committee members believed that the Legislative Yuan is the highest legislative body of the government, and all national measures should have explicit regulations before all laws and regulations can be approved. Therefore, it was decided to write to Premier Song again, urging him to attend the next regular meeting and report and consult on financial and economic policies. (2) The President designated several people to specifically investigate the current financial, monetary, and economic situation. Before Sun's mention of the title of President: The multiple of the salary increase for civil servants decided by the last regular meeting of this committee was 600 times the original salary, plus a living allowance of 150,000 yuan. However, the Central Social News issued a news release on the same day saying that the increase was 1,000 times, plus a living allowance of 200,000 (this newspaper's special dispatch is correct). It is actually a misrepresentation and will be corrected. Then Li Qing, Jian Guansan, Dai Xiujun, and other committee members made speeches to explain the misunderstandings of the general public, and the meeting was quite intense, and it did not end until 1:00 PM.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Nanjing 25th Dispatch] Regarding the increase in salaries for civil servants, legislators Sun Jiulu, Lou Tongsun, etc. said: The current salaries of civil servants are indeed too low. The Legislative Yuan approved 600 times the base salary plus a living allowance of 150,000 yuan, which is not too high. The employees of China Textile Corporation are paid 2,000 times their base salary of 80 yuan, and those with a base salary of more than 80 yuan are paid 1,000 times. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company pays all employees 2,000 times their base salary. Therefore, one employee can earn more than 100,000 yuan. As for the claim that this new regulation will increase the national budget by 690 million yuan and stimulate price increases, it is unbelievable. Because civil servants' salaries have only increased by 160 times to date, while prices have increased by 3,000 or 5,000 times.</p>
<h3>Jinan People's Volunteer Training Team Formally Established</h3>

<h3>Rehe Provincial Three-Person Executive Group to Depart Immediately to Mediate Conflicts; 30,000 Communist Troops Attack Yebaishou</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Peiping 25th Dispatch] Zhu Jiewu, the representative sent by the military government to Beipiao in Rehe Province, has returned to Peiping today. According to reports, as a result of his liaison, the three-person executive groups in Chengde, Chifeng, and Chaoyang in Rehe Province will depart immediately to begin mediating the conflicts in Rehe.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Chaoyang 24th Dispatch] On April 13, tens of thousands of Communist troops in Rehe launched an offensive, launching successive attacks on Beipiao, Gushan, Reshui, Pingzhuang, and other places, and carried out large-scale destruction, causing the general public to be displaced and nine out of ten houses empty. Recently, the situation has worsened, and more than 30,000 Communist troops have been assembled to besiege Yebaishou. According to reliable reports, there are the 22nd, 27th, and 30th Brigades and the 1st and 3rd Brigades, among which there are Japanese people, and there are many cavalry.

<p>[Our Newspaper Jinan 25th Dispatch] Military sources: The Communist forces have gathered more than 20,000 troops near Yucheng, with the intention of attacking Qihe and Jinan. Also, more than 3,000 Communist troops have increased from Longshan to Guodian, with 40 vehicles attached, and are now advancing towards Shili, claiming that they will attack Jinan.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Jinan 24th Dispatch] Wang Yaowu, commander of the Second Pacification Zone, specially dispatched Deputy Chief of Staff Luo Xingli to accompany Davis, the American representative of the Jinan Group, and Wen Ze, the government representative, to fly to Linyi by special plane on the morning of the 24th to invite Chen Yi, commander of the Communist New Fourth Army, to Jinan or to Peiping. According to semi-official sources, this negotiation is about the future of peace and war in Shandong.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Jinan 24th Dispatch] The offensive of the Communist forces against the Jiaoji Railway line and the Jinan Outer Corps has been quelled due to the emergency measures taken by the National Army, which effectively blocked them. As of yesterday, the battles in various places have mostly entered a stalemate. Only Guodian has had minor conflicts, and the tense atmosphere in Shandong in the past week has obviously eased. However, the Communist forces besieging Tai'an, Yizhou, Liaocheng, and Dexian have continued to increase their strength, and the Communist forces' mobilization near Qingdao is still very frequent. Around Zhucun and Zhangdian, more than 40,000 Communist troops have gathered, with a rather opportunistic appearance.</p>
<h3>Recent Traffic Situation on Jiaoji and Jinpu Railways</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Jinan 24th Dispatch] Since the Communist forces occupied Mingshui, Longshan, and other stations on the Jiaoji Railway, eastbound trains have been suspended. In order to maintain traffic, the railway bureau has changed the original mixed train and ordinary passenger train between Jinan and Zhangdian to a mixed train from Jinan to Guodian once a day, returning to Jinan on the same day. The Jinan-Tai'an section and the Jinan-Yancheng section of the Jinpu Railway are still maintained as they were.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Jinan 24th Dispatch] According to military and political authorities here, the Executive Group will continue to negotiate with the Communist forces regarding the Shanshui and Sishui areas occupied by the Communist forces on the Jiaoji Railway, hoping that the Communist forces will follow peaceful methods and withdraw voluntarily.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Jinan 23rd Dispatch] There was a small contact in Guodian on the 23rd, but the Communist forces increased their troops in Liaocheng, Dezhou, and Tai'an, and intensified their blockade. The situation is dangerous and serious. The Lu military and political authorities stated that they are determined to use reasonable methods to make them retreat voluntarily.</p>
<h3>New Xinjiang Peace Negotiations; Draft Agreement Signed</h3>

<h3>Our Troops Withdraw from Northern Vietnam, Change to Sea Route for Returning Home</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Hanoi, 24th] The plan for our troops to withdraw from northern Vietnam has been changed due to practical difficulties. The 116th and 130th divisions of the 53rd Army were originally scheduled to withdraw to Guangxi and return home from the 15th. However, as it is now the height of summer, marching on land would significantly impact the soldiers' health. With the designation of the Supreme Commander, the troops will now return home by sea. The Guangtou troops who had already entered Guangxi have also returned to concentrate in Haiphong to await ships. The Second Rong Division, originally waiting in Haiphong to go to Japan, will continue to be transported north according to the original plan. The headquarters of the First Front Army is returning to Shanghai via land, rail, and air transport. The entire transportation and withdrawal work is expected to be completed before June 10th.</p>

<h3>Trial of Traitor Lin Bosheng Concluded in Nanjing, Sentencing Scheduled for the Morning of the 31st of this Month</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 25th] The pseudo-Minister of Propaganda, Lin Bosheng, was publicly tried at the First Tribunal of the Capital High Court at 10 AM today. The arrangement of the courtroom and the support of the audience were the same as during the trial of Mei Siping. The Central Broadcasting Station's on-site photography team also arrived to broadcast and film newsreels. Presiding Judge was Zhao Chen, with Judges Ge Zhishang, and Jin Liewen. Prosecutor was Li Shihang, with clerks Xu Yizhen and Hua Shisheng. The traitor Lin was wearing a light gray paletot robe and yellow leather shoes, with silver-rimmed toric glasses on his nose. He entered the courtroom swaying and looking around under the watchful eyes of the crowd, appearing calm. Lin, a native of Guangdong, is 45 years old. Before the war, he served as a legislator, director of the Institute of International Studies, special commissioner of the Central Propaganda Department stationed in Hong Kong, and president of the Hong Kong Nanhua Daily, among other positions. Prosecutor Li read the indictment. The Presiding Judge then asked why he did not go to Chongqing. Lin replied that he only went to Hankou, and was then assigned to Hong Kong as the Director of the Institute of International Studies. Asked when he became involved with Wang Jingwei, he replied that he originally worked with Mr. Liao Zhongkai, and after Mr. Liao's death, he followed Wang Jingwei. Regarding the telegraph incident, Lin vehemently denied any involvement, claiming that he did not know the content of the telegraph beforehand. It was given to him by Chen Gongbo on the 28th, and he only learned about it when it was published in the Nanhua Daily and sent to the Central News Agency. He claimed that he had published it under orders, just like the traitor Mei Siping, indicating that the theories of traitors are generally similar. Lin also claimed that Wang Jingwei was the Vice President of the party at the time and had given him a letter saying that "peace negotiations" were merely suggestions. It was full peace or full war, peace by the central government, war also by the central government. Therefore, he believed that he had not deviated from the party's stance. As for the secret negotiations with the enemy, Lin vaguely skirted the issue and kept it a secret. However, he confessed to attending the pseudo Sixth National Congress and the pseudo Political Conference with Wang Jingwei to meet with Emperor Showa and others. Regarding the theft of the national orthodoxy, Lin cunningly argued, "Because the country cannot be divided, and the national system cannot be changed." The Presiding Judge sternly asked, "Is there a real National Government in Chongqing, do you know that or not?" Lin reluctantly replied, "I know, but ours is in the occupied area." This was immediately exposed by the Presiding Judge, "Then it is clearly a fake." This caused a burst of laughter in the courtroom, and Lin also shrugged and frowned, revealing his ugly state.</p>
<h3>Condemning the Central Government in Writing, Lin Pleads Guilty in Court</h3>
<p>The Presiding Judge also presented the secret peace plan, basic treaty, and Sino-Japanese alliance, etc. that the pseudo-government had boldly signed with Japan, treaties that would destroy the country and exterminate the people, to interrogate Lin. Lin strongly argued, "Diplomacy has advances and retreats. This is a technique. In the circumstances at that time, we had no choice but to compromise." When the Presiding Judge asked about the article he wrote, "Thinking of September 3rd from September 9th," Lin suddenly felt guilty and remorseful, and said in repentance, "That article was defamatory of the central government and Chairman Chiang. I admit my mistake." The Presiding Judge also mentioned that when Lin was the "pseudo-Governor of Anhui Province," he publicly sold opium and collected fees from opium dens, etc. Lin flatly denied this, saying, "If Bosheng ever took money from opium, please have the government execute me for this. If the government does not execute me, the people can also execute me." The continuous use of "execute" might be his way of expressing his repentance. After asking about his property and family, the court announced the beginning of the debate. Lin used his glib tongue to deliver a torrent of sophistry, repeating his set of theories to fool the people, and even gave a vivid speech, as if he had forgotten that he was in the defendant's dock. No matter how skilled his speech was, the distorted content could not gain him any sympathy. He vigorously emphasized the pseudo-Youth League's anti-drug campaign, believing it to be an "achievement" that could not be ignored. His defense lasted for one hour and ten minutes. After Lin finished speaking, the court-appointed defender Liu Xiancai stood up to defend three points: (1) The defendant had worked with Mr. Liao Zhongkai before the war and had contributed to the country. (2) During his tenure as the pseudo-Minister of Propaganda, he still had a national concept and promoted the anti-drug campaign. (3) He was able to admit his mistakes and was frank and sincere. The debate ended at 2:25 PM. The court will announce the verdict at 10:00 AM on the 31st of this month. Lin was remanded in custody. Lin's cousin Zhang Xushu and nephew Lin Jia also attended the hearing. According to them, Lin's family has a large population and is currently living in poverty in Shanghai, relying entirely on friends to survive.</p>
<h3>Review of Chen Bijun's Sentence, Ruling Sent to Nanjing</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Suzhou, 25th] Chen Bijun's application for review after being sentenced to life imprisonment by the Suzhou High Court was rejected by the Supreme Court, and the original verdict was approved. The original text of the ruling was delivered here today. The reporter read the contents and stated that Chen's defense of preserving cultural relics, helping refugees, and stabilizing grain prices, etc., was considered irrelevant to the establishment of the crime, even if true. As for presiding over the South China Special Affairs, because the grounds were not clearly stated, it was not considered. Moreover, considering that the defendant and the traitor Wang were husband and wife, and she agreed with her husband's claims and stepped into the legal net unknowingly, her criminal intent of conspiracy was slightly different, so sparing her death was not inappropriate and the original verdict should be approved.</p>
<h3>Enemy Spy Zhang Xiaolong Arrested in Nanjing</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 25th] The traitor Zhang Xiaolong, who served as the chief spy of the enemy's gendarmerie in Shanghai and the enemy's translation organ, committed many evils and was well-known. Recently, he was active in the logistics department after the capital's return and served as a receiving officer in Zhenjiang. After verification by a certain institution, he was captured in Nanjing at 6:00 PM tonight. At that time, he resisted arrest, but was disarmed and taken into custody. He is currently being interrogated.</p>
<h3>Wang Yaowu Orders His Subordinates to Donate Grain to Aid Staff and Students</h3>

<h3>Truman to Visit the Philippines in Early July, Inviting Chairman Chiang to Meet, Invitations to Independence Ceremony Sent</h3>

It is reported that formal invitations have been issued, inviting Chairman Chiang to attend the Philippine Independence Ceremony on July 4th, but currently there are no concrete plans that can be announced officially.</p>
<h3>Failure of US and Soviet Union to Reach Understanding Causes Instability in Far East Politics, Welles Says US Should Strive to Catch Up</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 24th] Former US Undersecretary of State Welles declared today that there is little hope for establishing a "peaceful rule" in China, India, and other politically unstable areas in Asia. The great powers have failed to reach an agreement on post-war solutions, and they should be directly responsible for most of the events in the Far East today. The incessant civil strife in China will continue until the US and the Soviet Union can reach some kind of understanding. This will encourage the political unity of the Chinese people, rather than hinder it. The entire Far East is suffering from the scourge of civil war due to the conflict of interests between the Soviet Union and the Western powers, with unrest everywhere. It has been almost a year since the end of the war in the Far East after Japan's defeat. However, in Vietnam, France is only temporarily suppressing the resistance of the local people by force. Korea is currently divided into two tightly sealed areas, one controlled by the Soviet Union and the other managed by the United States. The failure of the US and the Soviet Union to reach an agreement has prevented the Korean people from making any progress toward the independence promised at the Cairo Conference in 1943, and they cannot begin the reconstruction of their country. Of particular concern is the situation in India, which is at a critical juncture. It seems almost impossible to reach an agreement to allow the Indian people to regain their independence in the near future. Unless Indian political leaders can reach some agreement soon to establish a provisional government in preparation for eventual independence, the most serious unrest may occur at any time. Therefore, I believe that the US government should strive to catch up and urge the United Nations to take on joint responsibility and ensure that the Eastern nations striving for freedom can obtain assistance as soon as possible to move toward complete independence. This is probably the only way to prevent widespread disaster and ensure that the dependent nations of the East are protected in their pursuit of freedom.</p>
<h3>Chongqing Labor Issues, Proposed Solution</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Chongqing, 24th] The Chongqing Social Affairs Bureau's proposed solution to the Chongqing labor problem has been submitted to the Executive Yuan for review and will be implemented step by step after approval.

<p>[Our Newspaper, Hangzhou, 25th] The renovation of the Qiantang River seawall has been underway for a month. Our reporter met with the engineers yesterday, who told us that there is a mud pond behind the stone seawall. If the stone seawall were to be repaired first, it would take a long time. Now we are starting to repair the mud pond. When the tide comes, it will weaken the impact on the stone seawall, and the mud pond can effectively resist it. The Hangzhou-Haining, Shaoxing, and Pinghu three-section project is scheduled to be completed before July 15th.</p>

<h3>Rice Prices in Nanjing Expected to Fall, Mayor Ma Tells Reporters</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 25th] Nanjing Mayor Ma, when hosting reporters this afternoon, spoke about the rice situation in Nanjing: The city's rice prices have already fallen. If we can ensure that rice is not detained along the way and use passenger ships to transport rice exclusively, the source will naturally be smooth. Furthermore, if the rice prices in the areas near the city, such as Wuhu and Dangtu, are similar to those in the city, the rice source will not be obstructed. Also, the imported rice that our country purchased from the West is expected to arrive in Shanghai soon, so rice prices in Nanjing are expected to fall.</p>

<p>City District Elementary School Teachers Strike</p>
<p>Over seventy elementary school teachers in the city district, due to meager salaries and unbearable living conditions, gathered at the county government on the morning of the 23rd to petition. Chief Secretary Hao received them on behalf of the county magistrate. The teacher representatives presented four demands: (1) that the living subsidy of 45,000 yuan be multiplied by 140 and disbursed; (2) that each teacher be provided with one *shi* (approx. 133 lbs) of rice free of charge; (3) that each teacher be allocated 3 *dou* (approx. 1.6 gallons) of rice per month at 5,000 yuan; (4) that salaries and stipends be paid by the 16th of each month. The representatives, failing to obtain a definite response, convened a meeting that afternoon and decided to take collective leave and telegraphed Director Chen of the Education Department to request relief. As of the afternoon of the 24th, classes had not resumed.</p>

<p>County Assembly Standing Committee Resolution</p>
<p>The Standing Committee of the County Provisional Assembly held its third meeting on the 23rd and resolved: 1. This county is not a rice-producing area, and recent food reserves have been depleted. The supply from other areas is scarce, leading to soaring rice prices and public panic. With a surge of refugees from northern Jiangsu, we earnestly request Chairman Chiang Kai-shek to allocate a quantity for emergency relief and order a halt to military grain purchases to relieve the county. 2. The County Water and Electricity Consolidation Committee is not well-organized and its measures are inappropriate. We request the provincial government to dissolve it and return the original Waterworks Company and Dazhao Electric Light Company to their respective owners. 3. Regarding the previously agreed-upon invitation of local figures to form a Zhenjiang Five-Year Plan Committee, it is imperative to convene it on a fixed date, with Yao Qisu in charge.</p>

<p>Request for Relief from Stagnant Sales of Boiled Salt</p>
<p>Since the victory, the authorities of the Bao Lang and Haisha Salt Fields in Zhejiang, in order to improve the livelihood of salt workers and eliminate the contractor system, allowed merchants and citizens to freely compete in sales and entrusted the Minsheng Salt Industry to advance warehouse prices. They ordered sundried salt from the Yuyao Salt Field for direct distribution to salt merchants and soy sauce shops in the Hangzhou-Jiaxing-Huzhou area. Consequently, the cost of boiled salt from the Bao and Hai fields was higher, affecting sales and the livelihoods of the salt workers. In addition to completely halting production, they have jointly applied to the authorities for relief.</p>

<p>Weekly Forum</p>
<h3>A Humble Proposal to Revise Import Tariffs</h3>
<p>— Xu Jizhuang</p>
<p>(1) The Impact of the Current Exchange Rate on Trade</p>
<p>The foreign exchange rate recently set by the central government is relatively high. Taking the US dollar as an example, each US dollar is worth 2,020 Chinese yuan. Compared to the pre-war rate of three yuan per US dollar, this is only an increase of about 670 times. However, the value of the Chinese yuan domestically has recently fallen to less than one two-thousandth. Therefore, the prices of goods at home and abroad are deviating from the norm, and the value of the Chinese yuan has increased too much internationally. Under such an exchange rate, import values will inevitably far exceed exports, resulting in a huge import surplus. In international trade, the following phenomena will occur:</p>
<p>(A) Due to the higher exchange rate of the Chinese yuan, not only is the market wide open, but it is also artificially favorable to imports. Countries are vying to promote exports in order to compete for the post-war market and will inevitably sell large quantities of goods to our country. Chinese merchants, due to profit motives, will also abandon domestic goods and order foreign goods. As a result, the increase in the trade deficit will put pressure on the exchange market, making it difficult to maintain the exchange rate.</p>
<p>(B) Due to the high price of raw materials, high wages for workers, coupled with transportation difficulties and inferior production technology, the value of Chinese-made products, converted at an exchange rate of 2,000 to 1, is higher than that of foreign goods, making it difficult to sell them abroad. The export industry will be unable to operate. Chinese export goods are now among the most expensive in the world market, and the future is very bleak!</p>
<p>(C) China's industry was not developed before the war and has been devastated by the war, bordering on bankruptcy. After the war, raw materials are expensive, and production technology will be difficult to improve for a while. At an exchange rate of 2,000 to 1, manufactured goods cannot compete with foreign goods. This inherently weak industry will also have no day of recovery under artificial exchange rates.</p>
<p>(D) Although cheaper imports may temporarily alleviate the pressure of prices on the people, for those who have endured hardship for a long time, this is not necessarily beneficial. However, if this continues, more and more imported goods will drive domestic goods out of the market. Not only will imports and exports be unbalanced, and industry bankrupt, but the country will inevitably become poorer and poorer, and its purchasing power will weaken. Eventually, imports will also shrink, and only a few wealthy classes will still be able to consume some imported luxury goods. With the decline of national industry and the decay of machinery and equipment, what will become of the very essence when the skin is gone? The entire economy will inevitably be unable to recover.</p>
<p>In view of the above-mentioned disadvantages that may occur in international trade, some people advocate changing the exchange rate as a remedy. Their reasoning is that a lower exchange rate has the effect of promoting export trade. After the development of export trade, the agriculture and industry producing export goods will also recover, and people's employment and income can be increased accordingly. Especially in the interior, after the population and economic strength move to the coast, there may be a phenomenon of falling prices and economic recession. Promoting export trade to enable inland production to shift to the production of export goods is the most effective and natural remedy. Such arguments have their reasons, but after the exchange rate is lowered, although it can promote exports, it is extremely unfavorable to imports. At a time when China urgently needs foreign materials for economic construction, if the necessary import costs increase due to the exchange rate, it will greatly hinder the construction work. More importantly, a lower exchange rate is sufficient to stimulate domestic prices, causing them to rise. The rise in prices is already very obvious, and further stimulation by devaluing the exchange rate will inevitably increase price fluctuations.</p>
<p>The author believes that in order to use foreign materials for construction and at the same time prevent imports from hindering the development of domestic industry, it is better to use tariff policy as a manipulating tool than relying on the exchange rate. Tariff policy is more effective and flexible.</p>
<p>(2) The Import Tariff Needs to Be Revised Immediately. Using tariff policy can make international trade more balanced and the national economy slightly more stable. The import tariff needs to be revised immediately.</p>
<p>China's current import tariff was promulgated in the 23rd year of the Republic of China (1934). At that time, unequal treaties had not yet been abolished, and tariff policy was not fully autonomous. The last revision of the tariff, although seemingly automatic, was in fact constrained by Japan. Moreover, since the late Qing Dynasty, it has survived in a semi-colonial state for a long time. At that time, European and American countries used their dual political and economic power to protect the dumping of their large quantities of goods in the Chinese market and used trade treaties to prevent China from establishing a good tariff system. Although tariff autonomy was later obtained, it was still difficult to change the deeply rooted problems. The domestic production base was not established, and tariff revenue was the largest source of revenue for the government at the time. Therefore, the import tariffs that China has formulated in the past often focused on the amount of tax revenue and could not fully meet the requirements of the national economy. During the War of Resistance, the coast fell, and import and export trade plummeted. When the Yunnan-Burma Road was cut off, there was no way to communicate at home and abroad, and tariffs became a secondary problem. A group of economists began to concentrate their efforts on discussing how to open up financial resources to cope with the military and political expenses of the extraordinary period, and had no time to study import tariffs. Now that victory has come, nine months have passed. The Supreme National Defense Council at that time passed a resolution to open the foreign exchange market, with foreign exchange and trade being equally important. The Central Bank's Interim Measures for the Management of Foreign Exchange and the Interim Measures for Import and Export Trade were promulgated simultaneously, and lists of goods that were "freely imported," "licensed for import," and "prohibited for import" were also compiled separately. The spirit of promulgating this trade method was influenced by the global wave of reducing trade barriers, especially the American advocacy of free trade. Except for a few imports that require a permit or are prohibited, all are freely imported. Although this principle is not easy to change, the level of tax rates for freely imported goods still has considerable room for flexibility. If the tax rates are revised, the stimulus of foreign exchange advantages for imported goods can be offset or reduced by the tax rates, thereby remedying the disadvantages of excessively high exchange rates.</p>
<p>Moreover, the rise and fall of the exchange rate affects the entire international trade, and its impact on imports and exports, and on various types of imported and exported goods, is generally consistent and cannot be differentiated. Tariff policy does not have this difficulty. Different tax rates can be set for various imported and exported goods. For imported goods that are necessary and should be encouraged, extremely low taxes or even tax exemptions can be levied to allow them to enjoy the advantages of the exchange rate and be imported. Imported goods that are not needed or do not need to be encouraged can be subject to higher import taxes so that although the import price is very low due to the exchange rate advantages, it will not be too far from domestic products after adding tariffs. Such differential treatment can only be remedied by revising import tax rates.</p>
<p>(3) Principles for Revising Import Tax Rates</p>
<p>China's industry is backward. In order to promote production and development, the import tariffs promulgated in the 23rd year of the Republic of China (1934) should be abolished under the principle of not hindering international cooperation, and new import tax rates should be formulated based on the following principles:</p>
<p>A. Machinery and equipment related to industrialization should have low tax rates or be exempt from tax.</p>
<p>B. Raw materials that cannot be produced domestically should be taxed at a low rate.</p>
<p>C. Daily necessities for the people's livelihood, which cannot be manufactured for the time being before domestic industry has recovered, should have their import taxes reduced. However, these tax rates should be flexible and should be increased or decreased at any time according to the development of domestic industry.</p>
<p>D. The tax rate on luxury goods should be increased as much as possible, so that except for a few wealthy classes, the general public has no ability to purchase them.</p>
<p>E. The import tax rate for goods that compete with national products must be specially increased so that national products have the possibility of competing in the domestic market.</p>
<p>F. Subsidize exports or add other incentives.</p>
<p>In this way, the value of imported goods should be reduced in the future, the value of exported goods can be increased, the balance of international trade should be closer to equilibrium, the demand in the exchange market will not always have a one-sided trend, and the stability of the exchange rate must be better maintained. Although domestic import prices will increase due to tariffs, the exchange rate does not move, so people's hearts are stable, and there is no need to worry about stimulating general prices and leading to ignorant speculation. Domestic production can compete with imported goods under reasonable conditions without being sacrificed by artificial exchange rates, and the equipment for reconstruction can still be imported at extremely favorable exchange rates. Therefore, revising import tax rates can take care of all aspects, and the future of economic construction relies on it.</p>

<h3>Unprecedented Severity of the US Railway Labor Strike, Truman Orders Return to Work by Deadline, Otherwise Will Have Army Take Over Trains, Says Strikers Are Challenging the Government and Should Be Responded To</h3>
<p>[United Press International, Washington, 25th] President Truman addressed the striking railway workers nationwide today from the White House, demanding they return to work by 9 PM Standard Time today, otherwise he will order the army to take over the trains. The President likened this strike to the Japanese sneak attack on Pearl Harbor, stating: the strike has made the government face an unprecedented challenge, we must stand up and fight it, otherwise it would be an admission of incompetence. Railway union leaders Johnston and Whitney said they do not believe that strikes put private interests above the happiness of the country. If an adequate number of people do not return to work when the deadline expires, he will order soldiers to drive the trains and send troops to protect the returning workers. After the President's broadcast, telegrams of support poured in. However, railway union leaders refused to comment, and the response of the striking workers is still uncertain. The President told the strikers: I have advised Johnston and Whitney to search their conscience and consider the deaths and starvation caused by the strike. Congressional leaders said: The House will continue to meet after the President's speech in order to pass any bill that the President may propose. The Senate also agreed to temporarily suspend debate on the labor bill after the President's broadcast. However, Majority Leader Barkley said he does not believe the President will submit "definite specific" recommendations to a joint session of the House and Senate on Saturday night.</p>
<p>(Another dispatch) President Truman broadcast to the striking railway workers nationwide today, saying: I doubt whether the members of the two railway unions have thought about the unfortunate consequences caused by the strike when they went on strike. The transportation of relief food has now been interrupted. One hundred thousand tons of grain cannot be shipped due to the strike. People in various countries can barely make ends meet, and their daily needs depend on American relief. A small number of people in the United States are on strike, which prevents this relief food from being shipped out. How can they know that the lives of tens of thousands of people depend on this? This situation is tragic. If the American railways do not resume operation immediately, tens of thousands of people at home and abroad will starve to death.</p>
<h3>Special Meeting Held at the White House, General Eisenhower Also Recalled to Participate, Trains to Be Driven by Soldiers</h3>
<p>[US Information Service, Washington, 24th] President Truman held a special meeting this afternoon, attended by the Secretary of State, Secretary of the Treasury, Secretary of the Army, Secretary of the Navy, Secretary of the Interior, Secretary of Labor, Attorney General, Director of Mobilization, and Director of the Defense Transportation Administration, as well as Dr. Stillman, the President's railway strike mediator. Army Chief of Staff General Eisenhower has shortened his trip. He declared: He has received orders to immediately go to Washington to attend the meeting. An Army Department spokesman said: The Army is on standby, ready to protect the railways if necessary, but there is no news of rioting amid the strike. The Post Office announced that only parcels weighing sixteen ounces or less can be sent to other cities, with the exclusion of airmail. UNRRA Director LaGuardia said here today that the railway strike has completely disrupted the food relief transportation plan.</p>
<p>The President's mediator negotiated with railway labor and management for eight hours yesterday, and negotiations only broke down at 9 PM last night, and the railway strike officially began. Union leaders formally expressed their opposition to the President's proposal, demanding a uniform hourly wage increase of 18.5%, which is their condition for withdrawing the workers' demands to revise new regulations and improve working conditions.</p>
<p>[United Press International, Washington, 24th] After the US railway workers went on strike, some factories have been affected and closed. According to government officials familiar with the strike situation, the government will consider dispatching soldiers with driving experience to drive trains after taking over the railways, with personnel from the Army Railway Corps as the backbone. Veterans who served in the Army Railway Corps and have now retired are also being considered for recall. The Marine Corps has also been ordered to stand by. In this way, there will be enough people to ensure that the major railways in the country do not come to a standstill, but it will take some time to summon these veterans, and it may not be until next week that the railways can maintain the minimum required train service.</p>
<p>[United Press International, Oakland, California, 25th] After the US railway workers went on strike, 24 four-engine US Navy transport planes are now returning from bases in the Pacific and Asia, for urgent dispatch. According to the US National Air Transport Office, air transport between Honolulu, Guam, Tokyo, Manila, and Shanghai will be reduced by 40% as a result.</p>
<p>[United Press International, Washington, 24th] Government mediator Stillman declared after negotiating with railway workers for several hours today: "The strike situation is grim." Today, the number of strikers nationwide has reached 960,000, and tens of thousands more are idled at any time due to the railway strike.</p>
<h3>Relief Materials Frozen</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 25th] UNRRA and US Department of Agriculture officials said: the railway workers strike makes the United States unable to export the food needed by foreign countries for several weeks, if the strike continues to be prolonged in the famished areas of Europe and Asia, a great calamity will occur this summer. According to the spokesman for the UNRRA headquarters, most of the relief materials at ports on the east and west coasts have been frozen, and it is reported that dockworkers will go on strike at the beginning of next month. UNRRA officials are now consulting with labor leaders, requesting permission for UNRRA ships to continue loading.</p>
<h3>Two Thousand Dockworkers in Singapore Went on Strike Yesterday</h3>
<p>Ship Activity Halted</p>
<p>[United Press International, Singapore, 25th] Two thousand dockworkers in this port went on strike today because a Chinese worker had his leg injured for unknown reasons. The dockworkers went on strike to express their support. Port ship activity has been halted. Port authorities have declined to comment on the efforts to stop the strike.</p>
<h3>Original of the Treaty of Versailles Lost</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Paris, 24th] The original of the Treaty of Versailles of 1919, with the signatures of the conference representatives, after the First World War, has been lost or destroyed by the Germans. This was announced by the French Foreign Ministry when the ministry's diplomatic archives committee was established. With the exception of one copy retained at the French Embassy in Washington, all copies of the 1919 treaty have been destroyed or lost. When German troops approached Paris in June 1940, French officials burned some relevant political and diplomatic documents from that period. The Germans obtained the remaining part and transferred it to Berlin, and later moved it to Riesia. By July 3, 1940, it was moved to Elbertode and was found by the American army in the same year and returned to France.</p>
<h3>The British Cabinet Delegation to India Issues a Second Declaration: British Troops to Remain Stationed in India During the Transition; The Congress Party Reaffirms its Position on British Proposals</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] London, 25th Broadcast: Two hours ago (11 PM Shanghai time), the British Cabinet Delegation to India issued a second declaration in response to talks with the leaders of the Muslim League and the Standing Committee of the Congress Party. The main points can be summarized as follows: (1) During the transition period (it is hoped that the transition period will be extremely short), the British side will still be responsible for India's security; therefore, British troops will not withdraw from India for the time being. (2) After the establishment of the interim government, all administrative leadership positions will be filled by Indians, and Britain will never infringe upon Indian sovereignty.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the declaration stated that the British side requested the Indian side to fulfill two points: (1) The Indian side should conclude an agreement with Britain. (2) The Indian side should protect ethnic minorities.</p>
<p>[Reuters, New Delhi, 25th] The Indian Congress Party yesterday issued a resolution of 2,000 words, indicating that although the party wants to amend the Indian regime through peaceful cooperation, it still cannot have a final opinion on the suggestions of the British Cabinet representatives. The main points of the full text of the Congress Party Executive Committee's resolution are that the interim government and the final constitution must fully recognize the principle of Indian independence. All factors hindering independence must be removed immediately. For example, the continued stationing of British troops in India before the completion of the new constitution is tantamount to denying India's independence.</p>
<p>South Africa Passes Indian Bill</p>
<p>[Reuters, Pretoria, 25th] The South African Senate yesterday passed the Asian Land Tenure and Indian Representation Bill on its third reading, restricting Indians from buying land in Natal and Transvaal provinces, but granting Indian representatives limited voting rights.

<h3>British Foreign Secretary Bevin Defends Policy Towards Egypt in the House of Commons: Stationing Troops in Other Countries is Considered Outdated; Mutual Defense of the Suez Canal is Under Negotiation</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 25th] Foreign Secretary Bevin defended the government's Egyptian policy in the House of Commons yesterday, saying that the Egyptian issue is extremely difficult, and the government made this policy decision after careful consideration. After the war, all countries, large and small, recognized that they had acquired new status, and the United Nations General Assembly and small meetings also confirmed this change. The era of regional defense has begun after the war, unlike the previous defense that was the sole responsibility of one country. They believe that national security is closely related to the regional defense system. Since I have been Foreign Secretary, all the countries I have contacted hold this belief. Regarding the withdrawal issue, I feel that stationing troops in other countries is an unpleasant thing in any case, and it feels particularly outdated today. Therefore, at the beginning of the treaty revision negotiations, I suggested fulfilling our promise when we first entered Egypt, that is, to withdraw troops. We should first determine this principle, and then discuss how to replace the defense deployment. I feel that this promise is a sign of goodwill, and it is better for us to propose it today than to be forced to accept it in the future. Any country occupied by a foreign country inevitably has a sense of inferiority, and one of our primary tasks is to eliminate this sense of inferiority in the Egyptians. Unfortunately, our past relationship with Egypt was only aimed at a few people, without regard to the feelings of the general Egyptian people, and the basis for true understanding lies in understanding with the general people. We must admit that the trend has changed, and it is not what it used to be. Maintaining contact with Arab countries can only be based on friendship and can no longer rely on force. Islam is scattered throughout the Middle East and reaches the Indian peninsula. I dare to assert that since we have changed to a policy of trusting the Muslim nation, our reputation in the Muslim countries has indeed increased compared to the past. Regarding the defense of the canal zone, I dare to assure the House of Commons that after the withdrawal of troops, we will make proper defense arrangements and will not just ignore it. I have represented the British government in proposing new constructions to achieve the purpose of mutual defense, which is intended not only to protect the interests of Great Britain and its Republic, but ultimately to hope to contribute to the world security plan of the United Nations organization.</p>
<p>Chaotic Scene</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 25th] During the debate on the Egyptian issue in the House of Commons yesterday, the two major political leaders in Britain, Foreign Secretary Bevin and opposition leader Churchill, had a fierce argument, and the order was disrupted for more than ten minutes. Bevin and Churchill stood at one end of the long table. Behind the two were their supporters, and the latter cheered and cursed, causing a commotion throughout the venue. Churchill wanted to interrupt Bevin's speech, but Bevin did not allow it. The speaker shouted "Order," but it was to no avail. Later, Foreign Secretary McNeil lightly tugged on Bevin's collar, and Bevin finally allowed Churchill to speak. Suddenly, a faction supporting the government shouted that Churchill should not act like a primary school student, and the order became chaotic again. After a long time, Bevin was able to continue speaking.</p>
<p>Prospects for Negotiation</p>
<p>[Reuters, Cairo, 25th] After British Foreign Secretary Bevin announced in the House of Commons yesterday that the Egyptian negotiations would not be interrupted or stalled, those who had been pessimistic about the prospects for treaty revision negotiations were filled with hope again. The Egyptian Nationalist Party is now seizing Eden's proposal that all parties should participate in the negotiations on Egyptian independence. A representative of the Egyptian delegation said that the negotiations are expected to achieve satisfactory results, and what is now being disputed is that Britain wants to obtain all practical conveniences.</p>

<h3>"Strong Arm" Groups Appear in Poland: Secret Police Provide Training; Current Number Reaches 10,000</h3>
<p>[United Press, Warsaw, 24th] As the date of the Polish referendum and general election approaches, there are so-called "Strong Arm" groups, also known as People's Reserve Groups, whose purpose is said to be to assist formal military police in maintaining order during the referendum vote and general election. Polish secret police and military officers are now training thousands of young "Strong Arm" group members, teaching them shooting and killing techniques.

<h3>Leukemia Can Be Treated with Poison Gas</h3>
<p>[United Press, Atlantic City, 24th] Leukemia, a cancerous condition of the blood that causes an excessive increase in white blood cells, is a terrible disease. Today, according to Brigadier General Wilder of the US Chemical Warfare Department, who hosted reporters at the 109th meeting of the American Chemical Society: This disease can be treated with poison gas obtained from wartime research. Successful results have been obtained in animal experiments. Brigadier General Wilder elaborated that the war research department studied a type of poison gas called nitrogen mustard gas and discovered a nitrogen mustard compound that can be used to treat the disease and can cure leukemia in mice. According to Sanderson: The United States has prepared for the enemy to be accused of germ warfare during the war and must continue to prepare in the future. The reason is as follows: The use of biological substances as weapons is easier to detect, and there is no need for huge industrial equipment to engage in production. We must only prevent the enemy from using poison gas or biological weapons in the future, or both, and launch a small declaration of war in the style of a surprise attack on Pearl Harbor.</p>

<h3>The Northwest University Disturbance Subsides; President Liu Jihong Submits Resignation; Ministry of Education Repeatedly and Sincerely Urges Retention</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Chenggu by this Newspaper] Liu Jihong, President of Northwest University, went to Chongqing to discuss the issue of relocating the university with the Ministry of Education and attended the Second Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee. In mid-March, upon learning that a small number of students at the university, using the pretext of the student union organization issue, had incited a strike that lasted nearly a month, resulting in significant academic losses, he immediately submitted his resignation to the Ministry. He was not granted permission to resign and was temporarily allowed to return to the university to handle the disturbance.</p>
<p>Returning to the University to Persuade</p>
<p>He returned to the university on March 26th to persuade the students, and classes soon resumed in full. In early April, a guidance committee for the student union was established, resolving to provide reasonable guidance for the student union. It was believed that the student union issue could be brought to a close with this guidance. He then submitted his resignation to the Ministry a second time and temporarily refrained from going to the university to work. Upon hearing this, all faculty and staff of the university sent a telegram to Minister Zhu of the Ministry of Education, urging him to retain Liu Jihong. The student representatives of each class also passed a resolution to retain President Liu. Subsequently, Minister Zhu of the Ministry of Education telegraphed back to the university's faculty and staff and also telegraphed Liu Jihong, urging him to shoulder the difficult task and not entertain the idea of resigning again.</p>
<p>Outbreak of Riot</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, on April 15th, a small number of students started a riot. At that time, about a hundred people stormed into the university headquarters, forcibly confiscated the weapons of the university police, seized the official seals, forcibly occupied the offices, surrounded the president, and coerced him to leave the university. They also issued announcements and declarations without authorization and broke into the College of Law and Commerce, seizing guns and seals. That evening, the deans, department heads, and faculty representatives of the university held an emergency university affairs meeting and decided to collectively resign from their positions in support of the president, standing with the president through thick and thin. All the professors also signed their names to express their unified stance with their colleagues in the university affairs meeting. After the president left the university, the school fell into a state of chaos. These students took it upon themselves to guard the gates, collectively occupied the auditorium, opened the storage rooms, used public property, posted absurd slogans everywhere, confused public opinion, stabbed classmates, and created terror. The seriousness of the situation and the cruelty of their actions were unprecedented in student unrest.</p>
<p>Rising Up to Protect the University</p>
<p>However, the majority of the pure-hearted students, seeing that the established principles were being destroyed and the university was in imminent danger, expressed deep indignation. That evening, they spontaneously gathered and resolved to protect the university. On April 17th, a general meeting was held to establish the university protection group, and over eight hundred students signed up to protect the university, accounting for more than half of the entire student body. On the morning of the 19th, members of the university protection group set off in two groups. One group went to the city to post slogans, and the other group went to the College of Law and Commerce to defend it. The alumni association also actively assisted. When the university held registration at the College of Law and Commerce, all except for the students who had left the university and a few malcontents enthusiastically registered, totaling over a thousand people (the total number of students at the university was one thousand one hundred and seventeen). The dozens of malcontents, who occupied the university headquarters for a week, eventually disintegrated internally due to lack of support and fled on the night of the 22nd.</p>
<p>Investigating in Accordance with the Law</p>
<p>Among them, twenty people were arrested on the 23rd and transferred to the court for investigation in accordance with the law. When this disturbance occurred, the faculty and staff of the university resolved to unanimously support the president and stand with him through thick and thin, and they expressed their opinions to the Ministry of Education. At that time, the Ministry responded in a telegram, saying: "To Dean Zhao and all the teachers of Northwest University in Chenggu, your deleted telegram has been received. Regarding the disturbance at the university, Inspector Zhou Hongben and Cai Ruoshui have been dispatched to handle it, and President Liu has been telegraphed to return to the university as soon as possible to investigate the ringleaders and punish them severely. It is hoped that you will assist the president in resolving the disturbance and not entertain the idea of resigning again. [Signed] Ministry of Education, Mao You." Currently, President Liu has returned to the university, everything has returned to normal, and the semester and graduation exams are being held as scheduled. The relocation of the university is also underway, and the morale of the teachers and students is exceptionally united. They all hope that President Liu will continue his efforts and develop the university's affairs.</p>
<h3>The Student Strike at Two Classes of the National Capital Provisional University; A Resolution is Expected; Remedial Classes Have Already Taken the Exam as Scheduled; Preparatory Classes Will Reschedule the Exam for Another Day</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Nanjing by this Newspaper] In the remedial classes and preparatory classes of National Capital Provisional University, a small number of students in each class have been on strike demanding solutions to the distribution problem, while also coercing other students to do the same, creating opposition between students who did not want to take the exam and students who wanted to take the exam. The professors of the remedial classes, protecting the general body of students who wanted to take the exam, took appropriate measures, and on the afternoon of the 24th, everyone took the exam peacefully. The faculty and staff of the preparatory classes have been holding meetings with students for days, mediating the situation, and it is expected that the exam will be held soon. The situations of the two classes are described separately below:</p>
<p>Remedial Classes</p>
<p>A small number of students, several dozen, in this class insisted on not participating in the exam until the distribution problem was satisfactorily resolved and attempted to coerce the entire student body. They planned to hold a general student meeting at the auditorium at 8:00 AM on the 24th. The professors, considering the auditorium to be the examination hall, made preparations in advance. The several dozen students who did not want to take the exam originally planned to break into the auditorium, but they were stopped by the professors. They only shouted slogans, saying that the students taking the exam had no conscience. The students taking the exam were not stopped by the students who did not want to take the exam in front of the Jinling University gate. Because the professors and the inspectors sent by the Ministry of Education, Ding Xianzeng, Sun Aitang, and Chen Zongying, were exam proctors, they gave sincere guidance to these few students on the spot, and the students were moved. The professors' association also allowed students who did not participate in the exam in the morning to take a make-up exam. When the reporter arrived at the class in the afternoon, he first saw a public notice from the student union stating that the food problem had been resolved and that the distribution problem had been guaranteed by Professor Liu Ying on behalf of the professors' association (according to the professors, students who pass the exam can naturally be guaranteed distribution). They hoped that students who did not participate in the exam in the morning would come to register for a make-up exam. Subsequently, he saw candidates lined up in the auditorium, all taking the exam. The three inspectors from the Ministry of Education were supervising the exam in the examination hall, and the order was excellent. According to Director Wang Shulin, two-thirds of the students took the exam at 8:00 AM in the morning. After the professors' persuasion, the students expressed their acceptance, and the number of students taking the exam in the afternoon was even more enthusiastic. It is expected that the examination schedule will be completed by June 1st, and it is believed that it can be carried out to the end.</p>
<p>Preparatory Classes</p>
<p>For several days, over sixty students in this class have been taking the exam, while the rest, the majority who wanted to take the exam, were coerced and unable to take the exam. Only a very small number did not advocate taking the exam. On the evening of the 23rd, the faculty and staff proposed that students who had already taken the exam for two days should, starting next week (the 27th), take the exam together with the other students. The intention was to temporarily suspend the examination work on the 24th and concentrate their efforts to provide concrete guidance to the striking students in order to have the entire class take the exam on the 27th. However, the sixty students who had already taken the exam for several days believed that they had taken risks, been scolded, and left their dormitories to take the exam, so they should continue to take the exam. How could they accommodate those who had not taken the exam? Therefore, the order in which students took the exam and whether or not they took the exam created opposition. All the professors spent the entire day of the 24th talking and persuading the students about this matter. At 5:00 PM, the director of the class, Luo Yizeng, went to the Ministry of Education and invited Inspector Peng Baichuan to the class to hold a meeting with the professors to discuss solutions. According to general observation, since the students in the remedial classes have already completely taken the exam, the preparatory classes may also be able to continue the exam soon. (Foolish)</p>

<h3>Alumni of the College of Agriculture of Peiping University Launch a Movement to Restore the College; Alumni of the Medical College Also Express Interest in Restoring the College</h3>
<p>[Dispatch from Peiping by this Newspaper] Following the movement for the independence of the College of Engineering, alumni of the College of Agriculture of Peiping University in Peiping have launched a movement to restore the college.

<p>Peiping Side</p>
<p>On the 20th of this month, they sent representatives to visit Director Li of the Peiping Military Headquarters to request that he forward their request to the Ministry of Education for permission to restore the college.

<p>[Dispatch from This City] The College of Agriculture of National Peiping University, formerly Beijing Agricultural University, has been operating for over forty years. After the outbreak of war, the school moved west and temporarily merged with the Northwest Agricultural College. The Ministry of Education has repeatedly stated that it will decide to restore the school after the end of the war. Now that victory has been over a year, there is still no concrete plan for restoration, which has caused great concern among alumni everywhere.</p>
<p>Shanghai Side</p>
<p>Over seventy graduating classmates of the school who remained in Shanghai, including Mei Xuefang, Li Zhengyi, and Li Xiangyuan, recently gathered to discuss ways to restore the school and decided to respond to the school restoration movement of alumni everywhere. Their emotions were very strong. They also sent representatives to Beijing to petition and make three requests to the Ministry of Education: (1) Restore it as an independent College of Agriculture or Agricultural University; (2) All former faculty and staff should be invited back to the school; (3) The original school site must not be encroached upon by other schools.</p>

<h3>Reply to Readers: Legal Questions</h3>
<p>(1) Zhu Buyun asks: I have been in the army for ten years, and lost contact due to the fall of Wuhan. This time, my wife sent a letter saying: "Last year, on the orders of my father, I gave my eldest brother's son to you as your heir," etc. Now I have several questions, please advise! (1) Is the previous situation legally valid? (2) If, after demobilization from fighting the enemy, I have children, how should the inheritance of property be exercised? (3) Are there any separate laws that exempt me from the above restrictions due to being in a war zone or a soldier on expedition? (4) What kind of procedures should be followed to break this relationship?</p>
<p>[Lawyer Zhu Yakui answers] (1) The current Civil Code has abolished patriarchal inheritance, so there is no such thing as an "adopted son." As for adopting a child, if you have a spouse, you should do it together. Your wife adopted one for you without your consent, which is naturally invalid. (2) If you have children in the future, when the inheritance begins, the estate will naturally be inherited by your children. (3) There are no such separate laws. (4) To terminate the adoption relationship, if the requirements listed in Article 1081 of the Civil Code are met, you should seek a court judgment.</p>
<p>(2) A loyal reader from Wuxi asks: Mr. So-and-so died in 1939 at the age of 50, leaving behind a house. In 1941, his wife sold it with a written agreement. At that time, his eldest son was in military academy, participating in the war at the front; the second son was at home; and the youngest son was in middle school. None of them signed the agreement. Now the three brothers intend to deny the sale of this house and plan to negotiate: (1) The mother sold the estate of the father, and the sons are all of legal age, but did not sign the agreement on the spot. Can they raise an objection? (2) Originally, the sale of this house was supposed to be an exchange for farmland, but it was later changed to a cash payment. Due to the delay in payment, the high inflation rate caused a significant loss. Can they now seek compensation? (3) The acquirer is a Buddhist follower and uses evil forces, suspected of coercing signatures and bullying the orphaned and widowed. The house has now been demolished and rebuilt as the site of a Buddhist transportation association. At that time, it was impossible to appeal during the enemy occupation. How should they start negotiations now? (4) The eldest son is now working in the Ministry of Military Affairs and has sent a letter instructing us to publish a warning in the newspaper and raise an objection. Is it legal and effective?</p>
<p>[Lawyer Zhu Yakui answers] (1) The estate is jointly owned. If the consent of all joint owners is not obtained, the disposition is invalid. (2) Since the contract is invalid, there is no question of compensation for damages. (3) Seek a court judgment. (4) A lawsuit should be filed according to law to resolve the matter.</p>
<p>(3) Zhang Hao asks: A neighbor's daughter in my hometown has reached the legal age for marriage. After three years of marriage, due to disagreements between the couple, they cannot grow old together. She ran away last winter and has been hiding elsewhere for more than three months, living as someone's mistress. The husband has been unable to find her. Recently, I heard that the woman and her lover have asked lawyer Chen Wenju to represent them in suing the Shanghai District Court, claiming abuse, etc., and requesting a divorce. The defendant received a court summons and immediately hired a defense lawyer to attend. The first hearing was held, but the defendant did not appear in court. Now I have several questions: (1) Both parties reside in Qingyi, can the Shanghai District Court transfer the case to the Qingpu County government for mediation? (2) Can the plaintiff's mother and brother be implicated? (3) Can the defendant claim compensation for all losses from the plaintiff and her mother and brother?</p>
<p>[Lawyer Zhu Yakui answers] Since the matters you inquired about have already been sued and both parties have entrusted lawyers to act as agents in the litigation, you should wait quietly for the court's judgment, and it is not convenient to provide speculative answers.</p>

<h3>With the Situation Improving, Speculation Is Contained: The Gold Market Is Calm; US Dollar Falls 20 Yuan Compared to Before</h3>
<p>Yesterday's gold price fluctuated very slightly. The domestic situation is becoming more optimistic, and bulls have no opportunities to take advantage of.

Gold ornaments were 194,000. Silver sycee and silver dollars slightly rebounded. The underground money market was even more rampant, with interest rates as low as 1.2 fen.</p>
<p>The US dollar weakened slightly. It opened at 2350 yuan in the morning and was offered for sale, once falling to 2325, before rebounding slightly. However, it was difficult to exceed the morning's high. At noon, it struggled below 2340 yuan, and there were no special changes in the afternoon. The final price was down another 20 yuan from the previous closing. Hong Kong dollars still had difficulty gaining momentum, and the final price was down another 5 yuan.

Series C opened in the morning and immediately continued the momentum from the previous day, jumping to above 7600 yuan, before some people took profits. After the opening, it once fell back slightly to 7400 yuan, but it was soon boosted again. At noon, it rose again to above 7800 yuan. The final price was up 500 yuan from the previous closing.

<h3>Silver Coin Trading: Police and Finance Bureaus Confer and Decide to Strictly Ban It</h3>
<p>The Municipal Police Bureau and the Finance Bureau believe that the trading of non-standard silver coins and silver in the market is significantly affecting the financial situation. After consultation, they decided to strictly ban it and reiterated the Central Bank's decree on the exchange of silver coins, requiring that all silver coins be exchanged for legal tender and not be used as bargaining chips. Violators will have their silver coins confiscated and forfeited. The bureaus have already started a secret investigation of illegal traders dealing in silver coins.</p>

<h3>Yarn Market Sales Are Very Brisk: Spot Cotton Trading Begins</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the yarn market was stable and the line plain yarn was firm. Because customers from Hankou and Jingwu had a strong appetite for 20-count yarn, brands such as Double Horse, Fengnian, Flying Boat, and 16-count Guangming all rose by 10,000 to 20,000 yuan compared to the previous day. Due to the fact that the Fangjian Company slightly offered 42-count double-strand thread on Friday, there was no power to increase the price, and the price was very mediocre. There were not many transactions throughout the day.</p>
<p>The New York cotton market rose by 15 to 18 points. The near-term American dollar price was 27.78, the forward price was 28.42, and the Mittling spot price was 28.38.

The silk fabric market was more solid. Since today is Sunday, payments must be made the day after tomorrow, so selling prices were slightly higher. In the morning, American Asia was up 20,000 yuan, and Dacheng checkered crepe was up 30 to 40 yuan.</p>
<h3>The Rice Market Forms a Stalemate and Prices Are Not Easy to Lower: The City Government Will Convene a Meeting Tomorrow to Discuss Ways to Smooth Rice Supply</h3>
<p>The rice issue in this city is of great concern to the central government. In addition to strictly ordering the municipal government to plan appropriate measures, it will also send special envoys to Shanghai to thoroughly investigate the truth. It is reported that in addition to strictly controlling food transactions and investigating warehouse stocks, the municipal government specifically scheduled a meeting to encourage the purchase and transportation of food at 3:00 PM on Monday, the 27th, in the municipal government conference room to discuss solutions. In addition to Mayor Wu, Secretary-General He Dekui, Director Wu Kaixian, and Director Gu Chunfan, those who have been invited to participate include: Du Yuesheng, Wang Xiaolai, Xu Jilou, Xi Yushu, Feng Youzhen, Chen Xing, Secretary-General Xu Baiyuan of the Four-Bank Joint Office, Chairman Li Ming of the Banking Association, Executive Director Liu Hongsheng of the Executive Yuan, Director Liu Gongyun of the Enemy Property Disposal Bureau, Chairman Wan Molin of the Bean and Rice Industry Association, representatives of the Food Administration Office Shen Deren and Wang Daren, rice industry representatives Chen Shaolian, Cha Baosan, and Qu Zhenhua, bean and rice industry representatives Wu Rongsheng and Zhu Yongming, and rice and bean industry representative Zhang Xichao, etc.</p>

<p>In order to formulate countermeasures, the Rice Market Management Committee has scheduled an emergency joint meeting of the directors and supervisors of the Bean and Rice Industry Association, the Rice and Food Distribution Industry, and the Rice Shop Industry at 9:00 AM today (the 26th) to discuss effective measures.</p>
<p>Spot Checks on Businesses</p>
<p>Yesterday, a reporter visited Wu Kaixian, Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, and inquired about matters related to food. He said: The numbers of grain merchants and warehouse stocks registered have been compiled and sent to the bureau by the relevant associations, but the numbers are quite complicated and have not yet been completely sorted out. There are also a small number of reports that have not been submitted yet, and are still being urged. In order to ensure that the information reported by the grain merchants is accurate and without concealment, the bureau will conduct spot checks and reward citizens for reporting. Once the city's inventory registration is completed and the numbers are compiled, the bureau will report to the municipal government.</p>
<p>Rice Price Stalled</p>
<p>Yesterday, the rice market was stalled because customers believed that the cost of producing rice in the producing areas was too high and transportation was not smooth, and shops believed that prices were too high and sales were difficult. Flour sales were sporadic, rising again by 500 to 600 yuan to 700 to 800 yuan. The new wheat may be harvested within two weeks. The oil market had a large supply, but sales were normal, and prices were weak, falling by more than 1,000 yuan. Corn in Qingdao suddenly became disinterested and fell back by 1,000 yuan. Raw peanuts and high-priced ingredients were slightly moving outside the port, seeing a rise of 2,000 to 3,000 yuan. Zhongguan goods were stable.</p>
<p>Rice Arrival Statistics</p>
<p>Yesterday, the amount of rice arriving in this city, according to information from the rice market, totaled over 8,000 shi of white glutinous rice and other varieties. However, the total amount arriving was said to be around 15,000 shi. These rice merchants only publicly registered one-third of their total arrivals with the market. Although the other two-thirds were not registered, they were still traded in the market. Although this situation is not of great concern, it affects the rice market's arrival statistics to some extent.</p>
<h3>Chinese Stock Black Market: Yongsha Unmatched, Rumors of One Free Nine After Capital Increase</h3>
<p>Yongsha is still the target of speculation in the Chinese stock market. The market frequently spread the good news of "one free nine" (the market price is expected to be 700 yuan after the capital increase). In the future, the amount of offsetting will be relaxed, because the floor price has been reduced to one-tenth, ranking it among small stocks. It should be welcomed by the public. Buying sentiment is pervasive, with no retreat. Other stocks remain in a passive position, and small stocks feel even more inadequate. Yongsha and American Asia both closed higher than they opened. Jingfu and other three small stocks could not sustain high prices and fell back slightly at closing. As a result, Yongsha rose by 10% alone, American Asia was up 350 yuan, and Jingfu, Xinguang, and Qinxing rose slightly. The rest also rose slightly. However, the veteran stocks remained the same. The bidding price after the close was still upward. Foreign stocks had risen for many days. Yesterday, there were many floating profits and they were closed. Yisha fell from 14,500 yuan and British United fell from 13,100 yuan, but the results were still more stable than the previous closing. The less popular stocks had mixed fortunes.</p>
<h3>The Cloth Market Is Increasingly Strong</h3>
<p>The sales of grey cloth to the north are still strong, and the dyeing factories in this street are also purchasing, so the market atmosphere is becoming stronger. Colored cloth is being purchased sporadically from Hunan, Shanxi, Sichuan, Fujian, Guangdong and other places, so people's hearts are firm. Yesterday, Fangjian Company listed 12-pound fine cloth up 2,000 yuan, and other Shi Lin bleached cloth increased by 1,000 yuan. However, except for popular goods, there was not much change in printed cloth. The market situation continued to be strong in the afternoon. The price of 12-pound Longtou cloth was 52,000 yuan, and the price of 3A colored balls was 49,500 yuan, an increase of 1,000 yuan compared to the morning.</p>
<h3>Sugar Spot Is Scarce</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the goods opened by the new company could not be released until next Tuesday, so spot goods were still scarce and prices were tight again. The association's market price for medium white sugar was initially 71,000 yuan, then 1,500 yuan and 2,000 yuan, and in the afternoon it reached 73,000 yuan, an increase of more than 2,000 yuan. Raw sugar was 60,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Brazilian Tea Production Increases</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Brazilian Capital, 25th] Because the global tea supply continues to be short, Brazil's increased tea production is particularly important. The 1945 output is estimated at 1.5 million pounds, three times the average output between 1935 and 1939. In the past five years, output has been increasing year by year. More than half of last year's tea exports were sold to South American countries. The tea industry in the State of Sao Paulo, Brazil is particularly developed.</p>
<h3>Tianjin Exchange Industry Is Not Allowed to Buy and Sell US Dollars</h3>
<p>Tianjin News, there are a total of 63 exchange businesses in Tianjin. They used to buy and sell currencies and securities of various countries under the name of cigarette shops or ticket shops. Recently, they have mainly engaged in the buying and selling of US dollars. The Central Bank believes that the buying and selling of foreign currencies is related to foreign exchange and should be strictly managed to prevent malpractices. All exchange businesses have not obtained the Class A permit to operate in accordance with the Provisional Regulations on Foreign Exchange Management. It is specially stipulated that from the 20th of this month, they are not allowed to engage in the buying and selling of foreign currency banknotes. From now on, the buying and selling of US dollars and other foreign currency banknotes is only permitted to be operated by the 22 banks that have obtained the Class A permit.</p>
<h3>Double-Scented Jasmine: Tianjin Merchants Have Strong Demand, Market Prices Soar</h3>
<p>Fujian jasmine is double-scented with excellent quality, and is most favored by the Tianjin area. Although the demand is currently strong, due to the fact that the inventory in this city is very small and the traffic is bad, activities have been weak in recent days. At present, in order to respond to the urgent need, merchants from that area have come to Shanghai specifically to find goods. As a result, only Dadi Tea Factory sold more than 30 loads, and the price soared to 560,000 yuan per load. The same kind of goods in the store and warehouses in this street and in Suzhou and Wuxi are being sought out, but the supply and demand are balanced, and the overall situation is still lacking in change. As for the foreign tea market, foreign firms such as Indian firms Ruichang and Nianmazhi, although they have the intention to purchase, the owners insist on their prices, and it is difficult to reach an agreement.</p>
<h3>American Hog Bristle Price Falls: US$2.80 per Pound</h3>
<p>[United Press, San Francisco, 24th] Chinese importers reported today that the most recent market price for hog bristles is US$2.80 per pound. The market price had previously been as high as US$3.05 per pound.</p>
<h3>Japanese Improved Raw Silk</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Tokyo, 25th] The Raw Silk Committee, which belongs to the newly established Raw Silk Industry Department, believes that competition from rayon will increase sharply in the post-war silk market. It is specially engaged in studying methods to improve silk. The committee attaches particular importance to the improvement of silkworm cocoons. It is said that the silk currently in use is only suitable for wartime needs. The fibers are coarse, reaching a thickness of three deniers. However, ordinary demand is only 2.8 deniers. It is expected that when wartime inventory is used up, the reeling industry will adopt a better silkworm cocoon. It is said that the silkworm cocoon is made from silkworms of a better breed.</p>
<h3>50th Anniversary of the American Automobile Industry</h3>
<p>New Cars May Appear</p>
<p>[US News Service, Detroit, 24th] The chairman of the Packard Company, on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the American automobile industry, predicts that a new type of car may appear in 10 to 15 years. This type of car will be powered by a lightweight and solid gas turbine engine.</p>

<h3>Trade Associations: Further Reorganization</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The classification of industrial and commercial groups has standard regulations issued by the Ministry that can be used as a basis. However, the economic sector in this city is particularly complex. There are many trade unions, and many have a long history. Within an industry, there are often several groups coexisting. Their business objects are either simple or complex, and it is often difficult to match them with the standard regulations issued by the Ministry. After the victory, the Social Affairs Bureau began to reorganize the various public groups. Firstly, the procedures were too complicated, and there was no time to reorganize them separately. Secondly, due to the election, they did not want to spend too much time, which would hinder the election. Therefore, the above situations still could not be eliminated. Now that the election is over, and the reorganization work has basically come to an end, it is scheduled to convene the relevant groups on a daily basis from tomorrow to discuss reasonable merger or analysis methods. At the same time, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce will be invited to send representatives to participate and discuss together in order to seek compromise.</p>

<h3>Changchun Twenty-Nine Days (8)</h3>
<p>—Special Correspondent of this Newspaper, Shao Dianzhi</p>
<p>Since we eight reporters have lost our freedom, we have no choice but to stay indoors. We still have to wait for the facts to prove whether the Communist army's concern for our "safety" is in good faith. Behaviors such as the Communist army shooting at our residence and threatening us with bayonets do not seem to be intentional orders given to them by superiors, as they said, "protection." The nerves of journalists are quite sensitive. We are closely watching the new changes.</p>
<h3>A Record of Collective Starvation</h3>
<p>Communist soldiers and political instructors barge into rooms at will, constantly disturbing work. Whether they have business or not, they always want you to keep them company and chat. Because of the language barrier, it was a minor inconvenience to the five American colleagues, but it was a thorough nuisance to us.</p>
<p>After Rick came back, everyone heard that we were going to move and felt that this kind of change was not a favorable omen. Since we already felt "safe" enough with the guns protecting us for the sake of our "safety," there was no need to move. We didn't know where we were moving to, and on one hand, we felt suspicious, while on the other hand, we felt calm because we had good reasons to refuse his proposal. We also blamed each other for being too paranoid, misinterpreting good intentions, or that it was just casual talk that shouldn't cause unnecessary concerns. The next day, everyone forgot about it.</p>
<p>We found a copy of *Steamed Longevity Records of the Three Kingdoms* and *Notes from the Thatched Hall of Close Observation* in the house to amuse ourselves. Each person's work was just writing some notes, reading a few pages, and eating three meals. The sound of gunfire outside never stopped. Every American colleague learned to say "eat" and shout "kid," and the accurate pronunciation of our handyman's name was the most important thing.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, Liu Qiren came and said that it was already 4:30 PM, and Zhou Baozhong had originally invited everyone (including Rick and his driver, Pont) to dinner at 4:00 PM to talk to everyone. Now half an hour had passed. The car was waiting outside, so please get in the car. He also said that Mayor Zhao Junyu would also be invited. Liu Qiren would not attend due to other business.</p>
<p>We asked him where we were having dinner, and he replied that it was at the Yamato Hotel. We did not know the time and place of Zhou Baozhong's dinner beforehand. Since it was a "banquet," everyone had to shave and wash their faces. Abena had to put on some lipstick, so we had to ask Liu Qiren to wait ten minutes.</p>
<p>Liu Qiren said goodbye to us, and we took two cars straight to the Yamato Hotel, guarded by Communist soldiers. The driver of one car drove to another hotel without a guide, going to the wrong place. Rick, who originally lived in the Yamato Hotel, saw that it wasn't far away, so he got out of the car and walked three or four hundred meters. There were several Communist soldiers guarding the entrance of the Yamato Hotel. When we got out of the car, we saw one of the Communist soldiers who had escorted us wearing a mask made of a torn American flag. Lippmann watched for a while, wanting to say something, but he stopped because of the language barrier.</p>
<p>Walking into the Yamato Hotel, it was quiet and desolate, not at all like there was a banquet going on. A resident, the TASS reporter Petrov, was still there. He was very free. We ran up and down the stairs but didn't see anyone, even though according to Liu Qiren, we were already late, but the host hadn't arrived yet.</p>
<p>Rick said that everyone could rest in his room. We told the Communist soldier who escorted us to notify us when Zhou Baozhong arrived.</p>
<p>Rick's room faced a north-facing window, with two bullet holes in the window and bullets lodged in the wall. This was the result of the battle a few days ago. Rick arrived on the 13th on Stimson's small plane, and the pilot Pont lived in the same room as him. They originally planned to go to Harbin but unexpectedly got stuck here. Now ten people were crammed together in this room, making it difficult to move around. After waiting for a while, an adjutant came in and said that Commander Zhou was busy and had already driven back to pick him up. After waiting for a while, a letter signed by Zhou Baozhong was suddenly sent. The letter was addressed to the world and said:</p>
<p>"I believe it would be more convenient for you and the other American journalists to move to the old Yamato Hotel. It should have been moved this afternoon at 4:00, but the receptionist I sent to the hotel didn't make contact. Therefore, I troubled you to make an empty trip. Now, I still request that you and the other American journalists move to the 'Yamato' Hotel!"</p>
<p>Changes came, but we didn't make an empty trip at all; we were all waiting in Rick's room. We said, "Zhou Baozhong invited us to dinner, not to move. We didn't bring our belongings. We hope this matter can be decided after dinner."</p>
<p>The adjutant said, "Each of your rooms is already prepared. You can go and rest first. You don't need to go back. Your belongings can be moved for you. We will settle you down and then invite him over."</p>
<p>We said, "No, nothing can be touched without our permission. Lawman needs to see Zhou Baozhong now."</p>
<p>The adjutant said, "It can be left untouched. Commander Zhou is completely responsible for your safety. What attitude do you have towards this kindness?" His tone was completely threatening.</p>
<p>We said coldly, "We are only prepared to come for dinner now."</p>
<p>"Okay, I'll drive back and find him again."</p>
<p>Half an hour later, another Communist soldier came and said that refreshments had been prepared in the reception room downstairs. Please go downstairs to have some refreshments first because they knew everyone was hungry. Commander Zhou would be here right away. At this time, Rick went downstairs to take a look and came back and said there were no refreshments. The adjutant insisted on asking everyone to leave here and said that everything would be prepared once we went downstairs. Everyone was extremely annoyed, but they had to calm down and endure.</p>
<p>Lippmann, who was lying on the floor at this time, slowly got up, lit his pipe, and said, "According to American rules, guests shouldn't eat before the host arrives. We'll eat when Commander Zhou comes."</p>
<p>Rick was talking to everyone at this time, and the adjutant interrupted again, making Rick angry:</p>
<p>"Shut up! I'm talking to other people." After finishing what he had to say to everyone, he said to the adjutant who came over, "I am an American diplomat, you should be more polite to me, do you understand?"</p>
<p>"Understood," he replied.</p>
<p>"Good, then I'm telling you now," he looked at his watch and continued, "General Zhou Baozhong invited guests today, but we American children have been waiting for four hours. We are all extremely hungry. I am now expressing to you that I am very unhappy," Rick, as an American official, protested on behalf of all Americans.</p>
<p>We Chinese reporters were more tolerant than the Americans. We only hoped to see Zhou Baozhong so that we could exchange opinions directly with him. The adjutant saw that we didn't agree to move, didn't agree to go to the "prepared" rooms to rest, and didn't agree to go to the reception room to "have refreshments." Everyone insisted that because Zhou Baozhong invited us to dinner, we had to wait for the host. We just squeezed into Rick's room, playing word association games. Beckett fell asleep in bed. After a while, Abena was also silent. Shen Zhi, Shi Xun, Lippmann, and the driver Pont lay on the floor, their stomachs aching from hunger, but no one said they were hungry. There were no lights, only a candle, its light dim. Everyone talked about fun things, ignoring the adjutant. The adjutant stood for a while and said to himself, "Okay, I'll drive back and pick up the commander."</p>
<h3>A Midnight Meal</h3>
<p>After another hour, the adjutant came and said that Zhou Baozhong was downstairs, asking everyone to come down.</p>
<p>Some had already fallen asleep and were awakened one by one, their eyes drowsy, not knowing what time it was. Everyone was overjoyed as if they had been granted amnesty and ran downstairs happily. Rick was the last to leave, as if he was leading him.</p>
<p>We walked to a small restaurant on the second floor. There was a pile of soldiers at the door. We couldn't see clearly how many there were in the dark. They were probably on guard duty. Only one of the two doors of the restaurant was open. When we walked in, we saw a man of medium build wearing a black Zhongshan suit with a long, round face and many blemishes. It shone darkly in the candlelight. This was General Zhou Baozhong, the current garrison commander.</p>
<p>He shook hands with each of us, and we exchanged names. Food had indeed been prepared in the restaurant, and it was Russian Western food (the Yamato Hotel always served this kind of Western food). We sat down immediately. Zhou Baozhong and Abena sat at one end, Shen Zhi and Beckett sat at the other end, and the rest sat on either side, three on one side and four on the other, as shown in the diagram:</p>
<p>Most of the food on the table was pickled, cold and hard. Shen Zhi and Beckett didn't wait for the host to speak and started eating preserved meat first. After eating half a plate, Zhou Baozhong stood up and gave an opening speech, saying that he was very happy to meet the American friends and Chinese brothers because he was busy. He then expressed his condolences to everyone for being frightened during the war but didn't say why this "banquet" was held so late at night. We raised our glasses and drank vodka, followed by beer, and ate cold food.</p>
<p>Lippmann, a mischievous guy, suggested that Abena represent everyone in proposing a toast to Zhou Baozhong. Everyone agreed, but Abena said, "I don't drink alcohol from a young age, but I'm very happy to meet General Zhou today and I'm willing to drink a glass."</p>
<p>Then Zhou introduced himself, saying that he was a Communist Party member who had served as a regimental commander during the Northern Expedition and fought in Nanjing. After 1927, he studied and researched some issues. He had been to San Francisco and Moscow. He obtained a radio in San Francisco. Before the September 18th Incident, he went to the Northeast and had not left for fourteen years. He used this radio to listen to San Francisco broadcasts. The Anti-Japanese Allied Army he led, although blockaded by the Japanese army and even completely hiding its armed activities, could not block the news of the world from the United States. After more than ten years, he saw American friends for the first time today. The United States contributed the most in this war, so he wanted to toast to the United States and Truman, especially Abena, who traveled across the ocean from the West to the East as an American woman. He thought she was brave, so he also wanted to toast to American women.</p>
<p>Abena shook her head and said, "No, not brave at all. It's brave to drink a toast."</p>
<p>Zhou Baozhong believed that we Chinese reporters were important. The Americans were outsiders after all, and no matter what, they were separated from the Chinese people's own affairs. We also toasted.</p>
<p>We were hungry but drank cold wine, which was extremely uncomfortable. Our stomachs felt like they were cut open with a knife, and eating cold food felt like adding salt to the wound.</p>
<p>At this time, Beckett fell asleep next to Shen Zhi, snoring loudly. He once claimed to be a cat. Shen Zhi and Lippmann made faces at each other but finally woke him up. From then on, he kept his eyelids open to maintain a posture that didn't look like he was sleeping, but his expression was sad, making others feel sorry for him. He would show this sad face whenever something bored him.</p>
<p>Rick asked Zhou Baozhong that he planned to hunt in the Northeast and wondered what kind of wild animals he could get.</p>
<p>Zhou replied, "There are many forests in the Northeast, and there are many wild animals. In the past, when we were besieged by the Japanese army, we often hunted to feed ourselves."</p>
<p>Abena asked, "Have you hunted tigers too?"</p>
<p>"Yes, we have." This was the answer.</p>
<p>Zhou also talked about the unforgettable experience of hunting deer, saying that this was the time to hunt deer. The male deer grows antlers. The doe is in front when traveling to protect the male deer's antlers. When the antlers are fully grown in winter, the male deer protects the doe. Then they talked about the types of wild animals and Rick's plane. Rick's Stinson plane was not destroyed.</p>
<p>Zhou told the reporters that we lost our freedom entirely for our safety. Otherwise, the Communist Party couldn't bear the responsibility. He also announced: "The Democratic Allied Army formally occupied Changchun on the 19th." Zhou commanded this attack on Changchun. Regarding Guan Yaqu's use of trains to transport troops from Dehui, Zhou's response was already included in the "Seeing Off Erno" section above. Zhou also said, "We don't go where the Soviet army is, for fear that others will think we are colluding with them. The Soviet army once confiscated our guns, and the relationship was extremely bad."</p>
<p>After talking about this and that for two hours, it was almost time to leave. We were just waiting to hear the final conclusion. When we were eating, the door was crowded with Communist soldiers, and there were also seven or eight in the restaurant. The conclusion finally came. Zhou Baozhong said:</p>
<p>"Tonight, I hope you will stay at the Yamato Hotel. It will be more convenient for us to contact each other in the future, and at the same time, it would be inconvenient for us to send another group of people to protect you there, saving trouble. What do you think?"</p>
<p>Everyone immediately shook their heads and said, "No." Shen Zhi pulled Beckett, whose eyes widened slightly at this time.</p>
<p>"Then what about you Chinese brothers?"</p>
<p>We shook our heads again and said, "No." So Zhou Baozhong immediately asked for the reasons. Here are our reasons:</p>
<p>(1) The original house is very comfortable, like living in our own home.</p>
<p>(2) There is hot water, cold water, you can take a bath, and there is a kitchen to cook Chinese food. The chef used to be Wu Dasuai's chef, and the food is extremely well made.</p>
<p>(3) Today is a dinner invitation, and nothing has been packed, everything is casually thrown there.</p>
<p>(4) We also hope to invite you to dinner at our own home once.</p>
<p>But Zhou Baozhong hesitated for a while and said:</p>
<p>"I'm afraid there have already been some changes in your residence, right?"</p>
<p>Everyone felt that this sentence was very strange but said:</p>
<p>"We believe there won't be."</p>
<p>So Zhou Baozhong agreed to send us back to our residence. We invited him to eat at our "home" at 8:00 PM on the 24th. He agreed, and we still took the car he sent back to our residence. It was exactly 12:30 AM, and nothing in the house had changed.</p>
<p>We had all acted in a play again.</p>
<p>Zhou Baozhong did not come to the reporters' residence on the 24th. At 5:00 PM, we received a letter from him, which read:</p>
<p>"I will leave Changchun City for Siping Street at 6:00 PM tonight. I may return tomorrow. I am grateful for the kindness of the Chinese and foreign reporters, and I am sorry for the cancellation of the dinner at 8:00 PM due to official business. Please forgive me. I will come to pay my respects again when I return from Siping Street. Today, a special agent set fire to a warehouse at the train station. A landmine exploded at the Xiehe Hall, which was buried by the puppet army's Tieshi unit. Civilians triggered it, causing a major disaster. Last night, I received a message from the Northeast Bureau of our Central Committee, forwarded from the US Consulate in Shenyang, inquiring about the safety of Major Rick and the American reporters and how their lives are guaranteed. I have also reported to our Northeast Bureau regarding my own responsibilities. I hereby inform you."</p>
<p>On the evening of the 25th, from 8:00 PM, we talked until 12:30 AM. He brought a secretary surnamed Zhou who could understand English. This was the first time he brought a translator. Later, we learned that he was a reporter for the Xinhua News Agency. Xinhua News Agency reporters naturally worked freely.</p>
<p>On the morning of the 21st, which was also the day we sent the protest letter to Zhou Baozhong, Captain Liu, wearing civilian clothes, quietly went upstairs and said, "The Eighth Route Army guards in our small house have suddenly all left. Should we take out the guns we buried in the coal?" He asked Shi Xun for his opinion. Shi Xun translated this to several American colleagues, and they rushed downstairs like a swarm of bees to visit the small house where we had been concerned about our safety. Sure enough, all the guards inside had left, but we saw large pancakes as hard as iron left on the table.</p>
<p>We cautiously walked out of the gate, but we heard the sound of emergency assembly everywhere. At the same time, there was sporadic gunfire in the west. We knew this was another "change." Beckett went to the high point of the balcony upstairs to see, but he saw many "Eighth Route" soldiers with bayonets running urgently in all directions, running from Datong Square. We couldn't hear anything. Two Eighth Route soldiers hurrying past our wall shouted as they walked, one saying, "Damn it, it's flooded again." "Flooded" meant that a certain part had been attacked again.</p>

<h3>At the Xunyang Riverbank</h3>
<p>— A Dispatch from Jiujiang, 19th [of the month] by Liming</p>
<p>At the Xunyang Riverbank, gusts of river wind are busily welcoming and sending off passengers. Every pier and every ship is always crowded with people coming and going. Here, there are newly appointed officials arriving, honorable people returning to their hometowns, and dejected Japanese prisoners of war being sent back to their country. All kinds of people come and go in droves.</p>
<p>In the southern corner of the city, there are two lakes, an inner and an outer: one is Gantang, and the other is Nanmen, which is the only scenic area in the city. There is a small dam between the two lakes, and slender willows sway in the wind on the dam. The lake water is as clear as a mirror, surrounded by the city area and the original dam. The lake water is just a silence. Looking at the mountain area, the lights are like fishing fires. Under this scene, it is easiest to arouse people's infinite thoughts. The entire Gantang Lake undulates in silence.</p>
<p>Jiujiang—the only commercial port in Jiangxi Province, the throat of the whole province, was once one of the three major rice markets and one of the three major tea markets in China. Since being brutally ravaged by the Japanese invaders, it has suffered tremendous losses. Although there are already some government staff recovering the situation, it may take a considerable period of time to restore it to its former glory. On the surface, it seems that commerce is still prosperous, but in reality, it is far from what it used to be. In terms of industry, it can be said that there are no factories. There are only a few small-scale handicraft businesses.</p>
<p>Take the only viable porcelain industry in the city as an example: the main street along Binjiang Road and near the pier can be said to be full of porcelain shops. The number is certainly surprisingly large, but the business is extremely sluggish. Even when ships arrive, some shops are still cold and unable to get customers to visit. The rest of the various businesses are also unusually quiet. Even so, merchants are still struggling hard.</p>
<p>Since Jiujiang's recovery, the rise in special prices has been on the rise. The price of rice rose from two to three thousand yuan per stone after the recovery, and now it is more than thirty thousand yuan per stone. The prices of other commodities have also risen several times or even more than ten times. In addition, various donations and taxes are heavy, and the people are crying endlessly. There are many troops passing through, and the food supply seems to be in short supply, so that people are starving to death due to lack of food. Meningitis has also infected the city recently, and there are many patients. It can be said that they are suffering from poverty and illness.</p>
<p>Let's talk about the cultural circle. Jiujiang will also gradually embark on the road of recovery. Now there are gradually several small newspapers appearing. Of course, this is only a temporary supply, and there should be a large increase and improvement in the future. In the early days of victory, there were no bookstores. Now there are finally one or two. School institutions have also gradually moved in, and a library has also been set up. This has given the people of Jiujiang a unique spiritual food store and medical library. As for entertainment, I heard that there will be a movie soon, and there is only one Peking opera theater. Everything else has just begun to enter the germination period.</p>

<h3>Rice Prices and Salary Increases for Civil Servants</h3>
<p>Respected Editor: History's reflection and the evolution of reality both prove that the causes of fortune and misfortune in all human affairs stem from either correct perception or misperception. The former can bring fortune, while the latter can lead to disaster, as the saying goes, "One word can uplift a nation, one word can ruin a nation." Therefore, newspaper reports must be handled with utmost care. Setting aside other matters, please allow me to discuss the recent issues of rice prices and salary increases for civil servants.</p>
<p>Currently, regardless of the individual, when discussing the rice problem, they invariably add a few phrases, such as "lack of supply," "inconvenient transportation," "production not yet recovered," and "high interest rates." Indeed, these are standard formulas in economics. However, a few nights ago, while walking past several rice shops, I saw their goods piled high to the rafters. Overnight, they surged in price like crazy. The next night, walking past again, the situation was the same, but overnight, prices surged again like crazy. The situation on the third and fourth days, of course, need not be mentioned. I ask, which of the above formulas does the current rice price hike conform to as a justification? In reality, they are simply using the facade of the above formulas to exploit opportunities for price fluctuations and satisfy their lust for exorbitant profits. In short, the dire living conditions today are largely caused by human actions. I have also witnessed firsthand how, during a certain instance of speculative fervor, goods suddenly piled up like mountains on sidewalks on both sides of the road, with shouts and entreaties, practically dragging pedestrians into becoming customers. Once the fervor subsided, the situation transformed into a landscape of ruins. But the day before, transportation wasn't completely restored, and the day after, transportation wasn't completely cut off. The day before, factories weren't fully operational, and the day after, factories weren't completely shut down. Those formulas were continuously exploited by them in this manner. Not long ago, our wise measure of rice loans reappeared. As a result, the rice price of 24,500 yuan broke free like a kite with a severed string, drifting further and further away from its intended level, ultimately becoming unrecoverable. And rice merchants even shouted during their meetings: "Cancel the rice loans, and rice will become cheaper!" This alone suggests the underlying complexities. Once the rice loans were indeed canceled, the rice price soared again! The rice loan policy, wavering and indecisive, under the misguided measures of those in charge, ruined a good thing, and the harm has already deepened before the benefits could be seen.</p>
<p>Now, the salary increase for civil servants is one issue, and the competence or incompetence of civil servants is another issue. They should not be confused. If they are redundant staff, they should be eliminated. If they are corrupt, they should be dismissed. If they are superfluous organizations, they should be abolished. Supervision has its own department, and sanctions have their own legal code. As for integrity, diligence, and incorruptibility, these are what public servants should possess. If salaries are increased for these reasons, it is a routine assessment within the normal system, not the salary increase issue we are discussing now. These are two separate matters, not one. The current salary increase issue is about the livelihood of civil servants, which can also be said to be a matter of life and death. It shouldn't wait for requests from below but should be considered by those above in a timely manner. Don't wait until the children are crying from hunger before the parents reflect on their own obligations. This is not about human sentimentality but about responsibility. If you treat life and death as secondary and expect work to continue as usual, then it's hard to justify yourself! Studying on an empty stomach or serving the public on an empty stomach is a spirit of self-encouragement and cannot be expected of everyone. If you cite insufficient financial resources and express sympathy, this is not the tone that those holding the reins of the nation should use as a way to console themselves. As for the argument that salary increases stimulate price increases, why have prices already risen to such an extent when salaries haven't even been increased yet? Let's be frank: it's not that civil servants want salary increases; it's that they are demanding to recover the value lost due to continuous, invisible salary cuts. The other day, a newspaper also published an opinion advocating for layoffs, even if it means disregarding consequences and cutting half the staff first, so that those who remain can immediately receive double the salary. Would this be enough to maintain their livelihoods, or would prices not continue to rise afterward? If prices continue to rise, will another half be cut? If prices continue to rise under the current laissez-faire approach, of course, civil servants' livelihoods will become even more difficult, and of course, there will be more demands for salary increases. It can be seen that this approach may be feasible on one hand, but the livelihood issue on the other hand still needs to be considered.</p>
<p>The authorities should quickly establish effective measures to strictly manage essential goods. Otherwise, a portion of unscrupulous merchants will never stop the merry-go-round of price increases and salary increases in this difficult short period. The last drop of blood from civil servants and the remaining vitality of society will be sucked into the rotating wheel of the merry-go-round without leaving a trace. If they drag the remaining good urban areas into the abyss of unbearable hell, then besides "nationality," I don't know how to resolve "civil rights" and "people's livelihood." The current urgent situation doesn't require extravagant talk of other high-sounding theories. I dare to ask for a concentration of correct understanding, effective measures, and a complete spirit, allowing only correct perception and not allowing misperception, to jointly address the imminent dangers to life.</p>
<p>Xu Xingchi, May 21st</p>
<p>Provision of American Rice: Planning Ahead</p>
<p>Respected Editor: The soaring rice prices in this city are mostly caused by human factors, by collusion between officials and rice merchants, who manipulate prices to their own benefit, leading to this current phenomenon. It is painful to speak of. Rice loans were originally a kind intention of the government. But unfortunately, the handling was not done properly, benefiting only unscrupulous people who profited from them. Every time rice loans were issued, rice prices soared. I wonder if those in authority ask themselves with their hands on their hearts: have they lived up to the poor and suffering people? "Use harsh punishments to govern a chaotic state." A thorough investigation must be conducted, and several people must be executed to appease public anger. Unfortunately, the government is too lenient! Lenient! Lenient! Lenient to the point where the country is unrecognizable! Corruption is rampant everywhere, until we all perish together, which satisfies everyone! According to what your newspaper reported on the 19th of this month, a large shipment of American rice is arriving soon. Whether this is true or not is unknown. If it is indeed the case, please join forces with major newspapers and organizations to vigorously support Director Wu of the Social Affairs Bureau's proposal to use the Baojia system to provide citizens with rice at low prices. We must not repeat the mistake of throwing it into the tiger's mouth of rice merchants, who receive ten bags of allocated rice, sell half of them, and hoard the other half for profit. In this day and age, gentlemen are in decline, and petty people are in power. A conscientious proposal will often be destroyed by a group of villains who collude to seek private gain. Therefore, major newspapers and organizations must unite to support Director Wu's proposal to prevent it from being undermined by villains. Furthermore, Baojia leaders who handle the allocation of rice to the poor should be given a certain amount of handling fees, which should be included in the rice selling price. This can both curb corruption and prevent those who are willing to serve the public from shrinking back. However, any instances of corruption, adulteration, or adding water, once discovered or reported, will be severely punished and will not be tolerated. (The method: order the village chief to carry a long bamboo pole with a long cloth banner hanging from it, on which is written "Corrupt Bao Leader" or "A Leader" and parade through the city and this Bao for three days, then dismiss them from their position.) Everything succeeds if you plan ahead. If American rice is indeed arriving, convene a meeting of all parties before it arrives to avoid being caught off guard at the last minute. Otherwise, even if there is American rice to help the people, what can be done about the rice merchants who collude with each other and take advantage of the situation! I currently have a slight grasp on my living expenses and am pleading for the people and making a small contribution.</p>
<p>Respectfully, a survivor of hardship, May 20th</p>
<p>Collection of Exit Rice Tax in Qingpu</p>
<p>Respected Editor: Not long ago, the Yaocheng Town, a vital waterway between Qingpu and Shanghai and Songjiang, collected transit taxes from rice merchants, causing opposition from all parties and leading to clashes with boatmen. As a result, this tax was implicitly abolished. Unexpectedly, the Qingpu County authorities recently demanded money on rice again. They established construction promotion committees in various districts of the county. If rice is leaving the area, a tax of two sheng per shi must be paid to obtain a grain transportation certificate. This tax is collected by the rice industry on behalf of the authorities from their customers. Amidst the soaring rice prices, I have several thoughts regarding this tax: (1) The Qingpu District Construction Promotion Committees have achieved considerable success in collecting taxes from grain merchants, but the committees have not shown any progress or plans for "construction." What exactly is being "constructed?" It remains a mystery. (2) The certificates issued by the district committees have a sentence that says, "Hope that the patrol personnel along the way will protect and release." However, the effectiveness of this "protection and release" is somewhat subtle. One of our friends went to Zhujiajiao (the second district of Qingpu County) to purchase rice. He paid the tax and obtained the certificate as required. However, when his rice boat passed through Songze Village on the Shanghai-Qingpu Road, several armed comrades chased after them, inspected the boat, and insisted that his tax payment was insufficient. As a result, they had to offer four dou of unmilled rice before they were allowed to proceed. So much for "protection and release!" (3) Donating two sheng per shi of rice means that the common people who buy rice have to pay for the tax. Isn't this increasing the burden on the common people? On one hand, we want to stabilize rice prices, but on the other hand, we are increasing costs. What is the rationale behind this!</p>
<p>Sincerely, Wensheng</p>
<h3>Lanzhou Weekly</h3>
<p>— (May 12th to 18th, Special Correspondent Bingzi)</p>
<p>After the Shanghai Shen Bao newspaper's reprinted edition arrived in Lanzhou, readers generally found it to be light, lively, and very welcome. Daily subscriptions have been extremely enthusiastic.</p>
<p>The price of gold in Lanzhou has risen this week, from 174,000 yuan per tael to a peak of 200,000 yuan. On the 18th, it fell back to 192,000 yuan. The Executive Yuan's allocation of disaster relief grain to Gansu Province has increased to 5,000 tons, and agreement has been reached with the Ministry of Food to have it allocated from Chang'an and other counties in Shaanxi Province.</p>
<p>The Tian-Lan Railway officially commenced construction, decided to start from the 25th.</p>
<p>Gansu-Ningxia-Qinghai Inspector Gao Yihan, Gansu Provincial Chairman Cai Mengjian, Gansu High Court President Ye Zaichou, and others traveled together by car to inspect the counties in southern Gansu. After inspecting Lintan, Zhuoni, and other counties, they arrived in Minxian on the 15th.</p>
<p>The establishment of the Northwest Headquarters greatly inspired various clans. The Jamyang Hutuktu of the Labrang Monastery specially sent the monastery's Grand Zasso Abbot Cang Living Buddha to Lanzhou to offer congratulations. Abbot A and his entourage of more than 20 people paid their respects to Deputy Director Guo and Chairman Gu Zhenglun on the 17th.</p>
<p>A group of more than 20 students from the National Central University's Border Area Internship Group, led by Dr. Shu Huilin, a professor in the Department of Border Politics, came to the Northwest for internships and have arrived in Tianshui from Chongqing. They will arrive in Lanzhou soon.</p>

<h3>Kunqu in Chongqing</h3>
<p>— Zhu Taichi</p>
<p>Kunqu opera originated in the Southeast. From the mid-Ming Dynasty to the Qianlong and Jiaqing periods of the Qing Dynasty, it was popular throughout the country. After holding the leading role, it gradually declined. Only in the provinces of Jiangsu and Zhejiang did some of its style and influence remain. Sichuan, located in the remote West, originally had Sichuan opera, which was sharp in tone and refined in lyrics. People in Sichuan flocked to it. People from other provinces preferred Beijing opera. As for Kunqu, few knew its name, let alone learned it. During the war years, Chongqing was not only the center of politics and economics but also a place where culture gathered. Therefore, those who were skilled in this art formed societies with like-minded people to sing and harmonize together in their spare time, so as to maintain this art from decline. It was a grand event. Initially, there was the organization of the Yu Society. In the 30th year of the Republic of China, it was reorganized into the Chongqing Kunqu Society, which gathered many talents and was prosperous for a time. In addition to holding regular monthly gatherings, they also performed several times at the Guotai Theater, the Bank Club, and the Jiangsu Fellow Association. It was rare to hear this heavenly elegant music amidst the turmoil of the war. Therefore, each performance was highly praised. As for the figures in the Kunqu world, the industrialist Mu Ouchu, as an experienced veteran of this art, encouraged the younger generation, and his enthusiasm was no less than in his youth. Unfortunately, he soon died of cancer, leaving the Kunqu friends in Chongqing with a sense of loss. Fan Chongshi and He Jingyuan were two gentlemen who were as enthusiastic about promotion as Ouchu. Both gentlemen were from Sichuan, and at that time, they were both scholarly and fond of Kunqu. They devoted themselves to learning and became masters after several years. Fan played old male roles, and He played young male roles. Although their pronunciation was limited by the local dialect, their vocal strength was experienced and skillful, no different from veteran Kunqu performers. Other Kunqu performers, such as the Xiang Yuancun brothers Shengwu, Zhang Chonghe sisters Yunhe, Xu Yanzhi and Zhang Shanxiang, Ding Zhixiang, Qian Yiyu, Cheng Yunian, Shen Kezhuang, Gan Gongsan, Wang Daozhi, Wang Ziji, and others, were already famous in Beijing and Shanghai and renowned in the Kunqu world. Now, reuniting in a foreign land, they felt even more obliged to contribute. Ni Zongyang and Yao Shengshu were the core members of the Kunqu Society. Both gentlemen were originally disciples of the Xianni Society. Although they have changed professions, the rehearsals and arrangements were impossible without them. As for playing the flute, in addition to the two gentlemen, Xu Yanzhi, Gan Gongsan, and the Xiang brothers could also occasionally share the burden. In addition, due to the reputation spreading, many earnest scholars and ladies from prominent families came to learn, too many to list. Therefore, during the eight years of the Anti-Japanese War, Kunqu opera became popular in the capital of Chongqing and became a fashion for a time, allowing people from all provinces to appreciate this unique national music. This is all thanks to the members of the Chongqing Kunqu Society. When victory came and people returned to their homes, the Kunqu community in Chongqing scattered, and the grand gatherings were no more, which is very regrettable. It is said that Ni Zongyang is still in Chongqing, presiding over the arts. Mr. Ni will probably have to shoulder the burden alone.</p>
<p>Theater Review</p>
<h3>Watching the First Performance of the "Maple Forest Troupe"</h3>
<p>— Wu Ping</p>
<p>The name "Maple Forest Troupe" seems unfamiliar to readers. Indeed, the "Maple Forest Troupe" has not performed in any theater. It is neither a professional troupe nor an amateur troupe but purely a extracurricular troupe formed by students.</p>
<p>The "Maple Forest Troupe" is sponsored by students of the Agricultural Science Department of Linjiang University. They haven't been founded for long, but every student is willing to work hard. Therefore, on the afternoon of the 18th, they finally met the audience for the first time at the "Maple Forest Theater" in the school dormitory at Maple Forest Bridge. Moreover, the performance was very successful.</p>
<p>The preparation for this performance was quite difficult. They didn't have sufficient financial resources, and all the props were borrowed. It is said that the front-of-house director, Mr. Yuan, couldn't sleep well for several nights because of it.</p>
<p>All tickets were complimentary and assigned seating. Therefore, most of the audience were relatives and friends of the students, and the order was very good. The scheduled start time was 7:00 PM, but it was delayed by two hours due to makeup and other reasons. Around 9:00 PM, the curtain was raised amidst enthusiastic applause from the audience.</p>
<p>This performance consisted of three one-act plays. The first was "Suzhou Nocturne" written by Tian Han. The content is: an old calligrapher suffered the ravages of war, destroying his family and all his artistic works. Later, he took up a gun, but in the end, he picked up his writing brush again and took his students to Suzhou to sketch. In Suzhou, he accidentally encountered his lost daughter, who had become a flower girl. When he learned that his old wife had passed away due to poverty, he was overcome with grief and joy, embraced his reunited daughter, and couldn't help but deeply curse the evils of war and poverty.</p>
<p>The second act, "Unmarried Couple," was written by Cao Yu. It tells the story of an engaged but unmarried couple who moved inland with the Anti-Japanese War. The man pretended to be married because the landlord wouldn't rent to single people. The woman wanted to claim to be unmarried because the company wouldn't hire married women. At that time, the woman's superior came to visit, and a dispute arose with the landlord over whether the couple was married or not, and thus a comedy unfolded.</p>
<p>"Tragedy on the Lake," written by Tian Han, was performed last. A passionate young poet reunited with his former lover, who had attempted suicide, on the shore of West Lake. However, when the woman learned that the man already had a wife, she was deeply disappointed and resolutely committed suicide again, unwilling to ruin her lover's happy family.</p>
<p>The above three plays had already received good reviews, so there is no need to elaborate. What needs to be reviewed now is the performance of the "Maple Forest Troupe." Generally speaking, the entire performance was successful. Every actor and staff member was willing to work hard. In particular, the appropriateness of the props, lighting, and makeup was quite remarkable.</p>
<p>Speaking of acting skills, the students, without any stage experience, collaborated and performed for the first time without any stage fright. On the contrary, they showed very experienced acting skills and lifelike expressions, which is commendable. Among them, only one or two actors spoke too softly, and there were a few lines that were said incorrectly or omitted in a hurry, but we cannot erase the entire achievement with these minor flaws.</p>
<p>Finally, with the greatest sincerity, we look forward to every promising actor and staff member of the "Maple Forest Troupe" continuing to work hard and hope to see another more satisfactory performance in the near future.</p>
<p>Play Introduction</p>
<h3>"Old Grievances, New Sorrows"</h3>
<p>— He Wei</p>
<p>Playwright: Tao Xiong</p>
<p>Publisher: Wenjiang Bookstore</p>
<p>I remember when Tao Xiong's debut work, "Anti-Spy," was published in Chongqing in the 30th year of the Republic of China, it was widely performed by theater groups in various places and was well received by audiences. Five years later, his second work, the four-act tragedy "Old Grievances, New Sorrows," was published as a single edition in Shanghai. The content, technique, dialogue, characterization, structure, and plot of this play are all better than "Anti-Spy." The theme is also timely, depicting old lovers before the Anti-Japanese War who were separated during the eight years of war. When they reunited after victory, the situation was no longer the same, and they could only feel increased sorrow and hatred. After reading it, I had many thoughts, deep impressions, and was very moved. Therefore, I would like to introduce it to readers!</p>
<p>Film Introduction</p>
<h3>Top Ten Films of 1945</h3>
<p>— Ya Qing</p>
<p>The American daily film newspaper has a grand election every year. It hires hundreds of designated representatives and film critics from various newspapers and magazines to jointly and solemnly vote to select the most perfect top ten films to encourage and reward the directors, screenwriters, actors, and staff of these films.</p>
<p>Last year, 1945, was the 24th year of the election, and its history can be said to be very long. In the past five years, due to the war, the blockbuster films that were listed as champions could not be announced to fans as scheduled. Here, I would also like to report the film titles to you readers: 1940 "Rebecca", 1941 "Gone With the Wind", 1942 "Mrs. Miniver", 1943 "Random Harvest", 1944 "Going My Way". The first three films have been shown in Shanghai one after another, and the latter two have not yet been shown.</p>
<p>As for the top ten films of 1945, let me introduce them to the readers one by one as follows:</p>
<p>(1) "Wilson"—A color biographical film produced by 20th Century Fox, which was recently shown in Shanghai. Completed on August 2, 1944.</p>
<p>(2) "A Tree Grows in Brooklyn"—Produced by 20th Century Fox.</p>
<p>(3) "The Keys of the Kingdom"—Produced by 20th Century Fox. It will be shown at the Majestic Theater in this city.</p>
<p>(4) "The Valley of Decision"—Produced by MGM, a literary film starring Greer Garson.</p>
<p>(5) "A Song to Remember"—A color musical biographical film produced by Columbia, starring Paul Muni, Merle Oberon, and Cornel Wilde.</p>
<p>(6) "Laura"—Produced by 20th Century Fox, starring Gene Tierney.</p>
<p>(7) "The Story of G.I. Joe"—A war film produced by United Artists.</p>
<p>(8) "The Corn Is Green"—Produced by Warner Bros., a literary film starring Bette Davis.</p>
<p>(9) "National Velvet"—A color horse film produced by MGM, starring Mickey Rooney.</p>
<p>(10) "Anchors Aweigh"—A color musical film produced by MGM, performed by the original cast of "Thousands Cheer".</p>
<p>Because the films they select are based on films officially released in American theaters from November 1 of the previous year to October 31 of the following year, "The Bells of St. Mary's" and "The Lost Weekend" were not included, while "Wilson" was included in the 1945 film list for this reason.</p>
<p>Film City News</p>
<h3>"The Garden of Eden"</h3>
<p>— Hua</p>
<p>"The Garden of Eden" is a new film that has recently caused a sensation in Film City, but it may face difficulties in passing censorship.</p>
<p>This film and "The Bells of St. Mary's," which was recently shown at the Grand Shanghai, are from the same producer—Leo McCarey. According to his recent remarks: "This film cannot be made according to the original story of the Bible, although the Bible has several passages describing:" We know that Adam and Eve never thought of wearing clothes until after Eve stole the fruit of knowledge," but the censorship office said that filming is not allowed without clothes."</p>
<p>"The actors also expressed the same: The film was originally intended to have Ingrid Bergman and James Stewart play the two ancestors of mankind, but Stewart refused to accept the offer because he had tumors on his scalp and skin and could not film this kind of film."</p>
<p>"The company considered using leopard skin to cover the waist, but Adam never killed any wild beasts in the Garden of Eden. Someone suggested using fig leaves to make coverings because there are such trees in paradise, but they are still unwilling to try this."</p>
<p>"Fig leaves are continuous and can be loosely separated after braiding, which is very suitable for this purpose, but how can this form allow Miss Bergman to work?"</p>
<p>Mr. McCarey is a giant of religious films. He has now built the Garden of Eden on 300 acres and raised hundreds of wild animals. Historical experts are also studying and designing solutions to clothing problems.</p>
<h3>The Movie King: MGM</h3>
<p>— Xin Ming</p>
<p>With a history of just over twenty years, in terms of reputation, dedication to production, and talent scouting in Hollywood, MGM has always been a pioneer and leader, the "trust" of the entire Hollywood. However, a large part of its success is due to its manager, Louis B. Mayer. His skillfulness in managing affairs, competence in doing things, and remarkable achievements have earned him the title of "Movie Manager of the Year" by the American "Fortune" magazine last year. Congratulations on his success.</p>
<p>At the same time, you only need to see MGM's neat "cast list" for 1945—they were all promoted by Mayer. MGM currently has more than 20 leading male and female stars, whose names are as follows: Van Johnson, Myrna Loy, Robert Taylor, Spencer Tracy, Clark Gable, Gene Kelly, Walter Pidgeon, Ward Bond, William Powell, Robert Montgomery. Greer Garson, Judy Garland, Katharine Grayson, Margaret O'Brien, Hepburn, Hedy Lamarr. Among the top ten highest-grossing stars of 1945, MGM stars accounted for five. Every movie fan must be amazed and undeniably acknowledge that MGM truly deserves to be the king of Hollywood and even the king of the global film industry.</p>
<p>This year, Louis B. Mayer has even more passionate hopes. He said, "We are like racehorses. In 1942, we were the top stable in America in 1945, so this year we still have to find good horses to fill the ranks and strive for first place." This shows how humble and not arrogant he is, which is why he can attract so many stars.</p>
<p>Finally, let me introduce some of MGM's best films of 1945 for movie fans to choose from, so as not to miss the masterpieces. First, "The Valley of Decision," a literary film starring Greer Garson. Second, "Anchors Aweigh," a Technicolor musical extravaganza performed by the original cast to great acclaim. Third, "National Velvet," a Technicolor horse racing film starring Myrna Loy. Fourth, "Meet Me in St. Louis," a Technicolor musical starring Judy Garland and Margaret O'Brien.</p>
<h3>Short-Lived Song and Dance Actresses</h3>
<p>— Ya Feng</p>
<p>The careers of movie stars are usually limited by age, especially song and dance girls on the screen. Their "career life expectancy" is only three to five years.</p>
<p>Jack Cole, the dance director of Columbia Pictures, his lover is a girl in a song and dance troupe. She left there after the age of twenty-one.</p>
<p>Cole said: "Nine out of ten song and dance actresses on the screen are between the ages of eighteen and twenty-one. It is almost certain that no one in Hollywood is over twenty-five. This sentence is of course not applicable to special dancers, then she can dance even after thirty or even forty years old, like artistic programs perform."</p>
<p>Cole believes that the fatal wound of the short career life of song and dance girls is for the audience to welcome their "novelty" and charmingness", and this "novelty" and charmingness often disappears quickly after a strict rehearsal schedule.</p>
<p>"Since the advent of color films, the need for young girls has been greater." He said. To clarify this statement, Cole mentioned that in the musical "The Story of Jolson" (based on the life of Jolson), the female stars he accommodated were almost all under the age of twenty.</p>
<p>"Like this kind of color film, because there are many individual close-up shots of female stars, the average age is further reduced," the dance director said.</p>
<p>Many girls are suitable for dancing at the age of fifteen to seventeen, but before the age of eighteen, they still have to go to school, because the company's stars or special awards help them enter school.</p>
<p>"But don't feel sorry for their short careers," Cole said with a warning tone; "because they themselves don't feel sorry. In fact, they are the happiest in the film. Almost none of them need a career, what they want is a husband, and it seems that they have all found ideal people."——Originally published in the Shanghai Free West News on April 2nd</p>
<h3>Film Industry News</h3>
<p>Zong You, the author of the famous play "The Jade Kirin", after changing his career to writing and directing, still participates in acting from time to time, playing "old male roles". Now, in order to seek new development, he has returned to Nanjing to organize a new drama troupe, planning to stage a play in Nanjing first.</p>
<p>Sun Jianbai, a famous actor who became famous for playing "old male roles", has now officially left "China Film Studio" and joined the "Drama Academy Alumni Troupe". He will arrive in Beijing soon and will assist Mr. Wang Ruilin in rehearsing three or four plays in preparation for a tour of Shanghai, Hangzhou, Pingjin and other areas.</p>
<p>The National Academy of Drama has been restored and decided to move back to Nanjing. From mid-June, students who pay their own expenses can go east first. The entire school will move to Nanjing in mid-September, and it is expected to resume classes in Beijing before the end of the year.</p>
<h3>Family Entertainment</h3>
<p>— Lei Yun</p>
<p>Entertainment is innate and a right in human life. However, Chinese people have always not paid attention to this. In their spare time, they have no normal entertainment except playing cards and turning on the radio. This is actually a very serious problem in the family that cannot be ignored.</p>
<p>Entertainment should be proper, with not hindering it as the first priority, and should have the qualities of increasing knowledge, taking care of health, and being interesting.</p>
<p>For babies or children of two or three years old, the choice of toys should be based on nobility and cleanliness. Such as beautiful dolls, colorful pictures, and sounding musical instruments, can form his meaningful feelings. Avoid using puppets, Guanyin, Maitreya Buddha, etc. to induce superstitious impressions.</p>
<p>As for children aged six or seven to twelve or thirteen, playing with balls, kicking shuttlecocks, and jumping rope at home are also promoting normal exercise. Parents should save some money to purchase some children's reading materials for them to read after class and after meals. A beautiful and noble family should avoid children reading boring comic books, or letting children stand by the table and watch card games, or playing marbles and spinning sugar with other children, as well as all similar gambling games.</p>
<p>For young people over the age of fourteen or fifteen, they should develop their proper hobbies, such as collecting stamps, which can allow them to explore the customs and cultures of various countries and regions, as well as historical patterns, at the post office. Or, for those who like music, teach them to practice singing, learn musical notation, or simple instruments such as harmonicas and accordions. For those who love art, give them some practice painting models and drawing tools to engage in imitation and exploration. If children want to participate in outdoor sports, such as football, basketball, rowing, swimming, etc., parents should not prohibit them.</p>
<p>It seems that adults have no entertainment at home! No, people who like to read can subscribe to some beneficial books and newspapers, so that they can both relax and seek knowledge, so that their thoughts can keep up with the times and not become outdated and stubborn. Some people like to practice calligraphy, some people like to write books, and some people like to carve seals. Although they do not hope to become famous, the meaning of entertainment lies in it! Growing flowers and raising birds are also suitable entertainment, just do not spend two hours every morning looking at flowers, and raise seven or eight birds at home. Playing with things becomes a loss of ambition and loses the meaning of entertainment.</p>
<p>Don't girls and wives have no entertainment! No, women specialize in needlework and cooking. When doing needlework, they can strive for exquisiteness and originality; or when cooking, pay attention to deliciousness and make famous dishes. This can be said to be integrating entertainment into work. For the arrangement of the home and the arrangement of utensils, a woman with an artistic concept will also feel interested when she starts working.</p>
<p>Playing mahjong is one of the most undesirable forms of entertainment for women in Shanghai. If listening to the radio, they should also choose noble music, beneficial lectures, and educational broadcasts that inspire knowledge. If you only listen to low-level, nonsensical, and superstitious ghost stories, then the thoughts of the listeners will naturally become humble and dirty, which is truly unhelpful and harmful.</p>
