<h3>恢復交通與東北停戰　三人會已獲致協議　今日休會明商整軍問題</h3>
<p>〔本報南京什四日電〕軍事三人會議，今日晨九時，則舉行，至下午一時半始畢，爲歷次會議最長之一次，出席之三方代表，仍同昨日。本日議題爲恢復交通與東北停戰，據聞，此兩項問題，雙方意見業已接近，且已獲致協議，一俟整軍方案獲得協議後，即同時簽字。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿四日電〕軍事三人小組正式復會以來，今日已爲第三次會議，商談經過，一般看來尚稱圓滿，惟和平談判之重要關鍵，仍在今後之五日，緣今次會議必須解決之三大問題，前二者業已獲致協議，而最重要之整軍問題，尙未正式開始商談。三人會議會定明日休會一日，後日繼續舉有第四次會議，商談整軍問題，休會之意義，則在使雙方對整軍問題獲得較充裕之特間，以從事會議之　備。聞徐永昌定明日往訪馬棣爾，對後日開會內容有所商討，至恢復交通方面所致之協議，卅日將有文吿可以公佈。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿四日電〕第三方面代表，今日下午在國民大會堂，邀請政府代表有所會談。計政府代表到有邵力子，雷震，張厲生，王雲五，曾由張厲生部長作較長時間之報吿，該會至七時始畢。</p>
<h3>京軍警當局捕獲　「下關事件」肇事者　該管警察所長撤職</h3>
<p>中共擬備忘録送三人會議</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿四日電〕關於昨晚下關車站之情况，記者於十時半離下關時，曾見難民羣立於站前，十一時以後，即因難民羣衆堅欲請馬敍倫出見，而馬又堅不出室，以致釀成毆打情事，計被毆成傷者，據統計：有上海馬敍倫，雷澤瓊，陳震中，及新民報記者浦熙修，大公報記者高集，益世報記者徐斌，大中報記者徐士年，市政府新聞專員錢江潮，路人某君，及憲兵團部警務員吉增　，護軍憲兵排長高呈祥，及車站憲兵廖啓賢，李正才等，傷勢輕重不等，肇事後，即由警備司令部護達中央醫院治療，至肇事者，業經軍警當局在混之亂局面下，捕獲唐壽華，張明元，曹傳森，京長發，王明華，韓學純，嚴一萍，魯琪等八名，現均拘押於憲兵第一團團本部，將依法訊辦。</p>
<p>〔中央社南京廿四日電〕昨晚南京下關車站發生蘇北難民與從上海來之所謂反內戰請願者衝突事件，內政部聞訊，甚爲重視，該管警察所所長余湛，防範不力，已予撤職處分，並將下關警察局局長余翼羣記大過一次，首都警察廳長韓文埠予以申誡。又內政部張部長表示，對於社會秩序及人民身體安全，自當飭屬隨時切實保護。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿四日電〕中共代表團對於「下關事件」曾擬就備忘錄一件，內分三項，大致爲請求保障今後不再發生類似事件，及懲兇等等，業於今夜十時趕送三人會議。</p>
<h3>難民困苦自應同情　但用暴力則不可恕　中宣部發言人表示意見</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京廿四日電〕記者以昨晚下關　車站民衆衝突事件詢問中官部發言人之意見，承答如下；昨晚南京下關車站發生蘇北難民與從上海來之所謂反內戰請願者衝突事件，甚堪惋惜，吾人雖對於難民之困苦顛連，不勝同情，但其訴諸暴力，則無可寬恕，尤其新民報，大公報，益世報記者及憲兵數人受傷，更屬遺憾，地方當局必將嚴究，並懲罰暴行之責任者，以示儆戒。當此政府及美方友人正努力尋來和平，解決方案之際，一切煽動羣衆之運動，必須停止，此類煽動，必然引起騷擾，甚至流血而阻礙和平談判之進行。</p>
<p>〔本報南廿四日電〕今中宣部彭部長學油曾派鄧秘書。友德，黃副處長香山，至大公報曁益世報駐京辦事處及新民報慰問被難民誤傷之記者高集，徐斌，浦熙修三人。</p>
<p>負傷人數</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿四日電〕蘇北流亡難民，昨午夜在下關毆打馬敍倫等一訊，業略載昨日本報，今日據本報記者繼續調查，聞混亂中受傷之馬敍倫，雷潔　陳震中，闆寳航，與民盟代表葉篤義，及大公報，新民報，益世報三記者等十人，昨夜經當地憲　驅散羣衆，車送太平路中央醫院分院，除馬敍倫，陳震中，雷潔瓊，閻寶航，葉篤義五人留院休息外，餘者經包紮後即離院。今晨二時迄十時，各方聞訊，前往慰問者有周恩來，鄧穎超，騰代遠，郭沬若，邵力子。留院各人旋於今午十一時移住黃埔路中央醫院總院，下午續有馮玉祥夫人李德全女士等赴院探候。據該院醫師語記者，五人皆屬外傷，並無大礙，休養二三日，即可出院。記者見馬敍倫時，馬午睡方醒，臉上一無傷痕，精神尚好，衣白府綢短衫褲，仰臥病床，狀極悠閒。五人中傷勢較重之東吳女教授雷潔瓊女士，亦僅右眼角皮被玻璃擦破。兩臂有數處靑腫，體溫正常，會與記者長談，陳農中頭部受擊，現已復原，談風尤健。闔實航爲上海大明公司經理，自稱被臨時拉人請願團，右眼受傷，言不勝懊喪。</p>
<p>各人報告</p>
<p>〔本報南京二十四日電〕所謂人民代表中之包達三，張絗伯，盛丕華，黃延芳，陳立復，今在第三方面招待政府代表之會談席上，對昨日下關事件，作一口頭之報吿。首由黃延芳報吿請願經過，及其離滬時之情形，次由盛丕華報吿昨晚在下　被打之情形，再由張絧伯報吿到京請願之目的，及其使命，陳立復乃學生代表、據語記者，乃因滬地物價商漲，欲請願有以使學生獲得安心讀書之處所也。記者曾分訪該五代表，彼等認爲除去必須追回在毆打時所失各物外，並不願訴之於法律。</p>
<p>邵力子談</p>
<p>〔本報南京二十四日電〕關於所謂上海人民圍體代表，昨日午夜在下關被打之事件發生後，此間均稱爲「下關事件」。今日記者曾叩請力子氏，對此「下關事件」之看法？邵氏稱：「我認爲他們代表的態度很好，同時他們也欲大事化小，小事化無，不預備訴之於法律，不預備據大，這樣的態度很好。」</p>
<p>別有用心</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿四日電〕今本報記者遍訪有關各方，探詢馬叙倫等被難民毆打之經過詳情。據聞：此事事前政府毫無所聞，致市府新聞專員及憲兵官兵四人均被難民毆傷，此爲經衆目睹之事實，治安當局現正調查肇事眞相，且已於肇事當時詢獲八人，決依法秉公辦理，又據有資格之人士談：目前蘇北難民之悲憤情緒，業達沸點，已臨挺而走險之險境，渠等不僅痛恨共黨，即對政時忍讓之苦心，亦多時有怨言，今日難民問題之嚴重，盡人苦知，若謂難民肇事，或由政府唆使，如非臆測武斷，即爲別有用心，政府旣能優待禮讓中共及其他黨派人士，共集於有都，而公閒討論國是，又何懼自稱人民代表之馬叙倫等數人來京請願，明乎比，當知今日爲人故意張大其詞而諉過於政府者，殆因馬叙倫等被殿未死，血案苦未造成，意有未盡耳。</p>
<h3>國防部發言人　斥中共建議（續昨）</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京廿四日電〕如（一）中共代表所提第一項稱：「由三人會議立即宣佈東北長期停戰，並重申全國停戰命令，關於停戰命令，政府前已頒發兩次，且均爲共方所同意者，然均爲共軍破壞無遺，是停戰命令之能否收效，全在共軍之有無誠意遵行，倘共軍立即停止一切攻勢，則全面和平立刻可實現，又何待命令重申。」（二）中共代表所提第二項稱：「由三人會議立即協商恢復全國交通之具體辦法，並首先修復重要鐵路」，關於恢復全國交通，在以往兩次停戰命令中，均曾特別提示，在日本投降後，停戰令頒佈前，華北各鐵道均暢通無阻，至停戰令頒佈後，共黨竟利用國軍遵守停戰命令，不增兵防禦之機會，大舉由山地向鐵道綫攻擊，攻城奪地，分段破壞國家動脈，除北寗路尙可勉強全綫通車，但仍時遭襲擊外，其餘各綫均被共軍破壞不堪，本年二月後由軍事三人小组馬歇爾·張治中·周恩來三委員頒訂協議，即刻恢復交通，並由北平調處執行部於二月十一日以和字第四號命令頒佈實行，交通部　亦準條修理之人員器材於各鐵道，組織工程隊閉始修復，但均仍遭共軍之阻止而無法進行。三月十日馬張周三委員巡視華北各地，親見各　道綫城鎭之被共軍圍困，交通被共軍阻止修復，又成立三項協議：一。解除各城市之包圍，二。解除人民行動不自由之約束，三。不得藉故遲延修復鐵道之進行，但各地共軍不但繼續阻止修復，並更加强破壞，千萬人民，仍流離顛沛，不得還鄉。（三）中共代表所提建議第三項：「由三人會議定期商定令國及東北整軍及復員之具體補充辦法」。查自本年二月廿五日雙方簽訂關於軍隊整編及統編中共部隊爲國軍之基本方案，政府即遵照規定，依限造送表册，實施整編，現已進入第二期，且將依限完成，但中共方面，迄今仍未依照方案第四條之規定、將其部隊整編之表册，性質，兵力，武器、旅以上司令官之姓名，及各單位之駐地等初步工作方案，造送軍事小組，共軍之無誠意實施整編，已極顯明。（四）中共建議之第四項更屬空洞無際，在軍事衝突未能停止前，以召開政治協商會議，政治問題與停戰命令相提並論，是其延岩政策，已無所不用其極，停止衝，恢復交通，及整軍方案之實施，爲當前之急務突倘共軍出以至誠，此三項問題，當可依限解決，而政治問題亦可迎刃而解，如共方仍均節外生枝，意圖拖延時間，則其應負破壞和平統一阻撓建國之責任，更爲明顯。（完）</p>
<p>蘇北人民，不堪共軍騷極，流亡他鄉，集於鎭江者尤多。上圖示難民權宿於洞穴中之慘况，下圖爲難民收容所之情景。（紐約時報駐　記者攝）</p>
<h3>平臨參會今成立　蔣主席特頒訓詞</h3>
<p>〔中央社北平廿四日電〕平臨時參議會經數月之籌備，現已就緒，定廿五日正式開會。蔣主席特頒訓詞，以三點勗勉，（一）當前急務惟在迅速恢復社會秩序，一面力行節約，一面提高生產，目前糧荒嚴重，到處皆然，如何力行節儲，善爲　劑，檢舉囤積，倡導救荒，以期克渡難關；（二）目前謀保甲組織之嚴密與淸明實爲切實之圖，而扶植善類與伸張正義二者尤應相輔並行，庶可裨切政令之推行，端正人心之趨向；（三）國家對外抗戰不得已，而又向人民徵發租借之舉，目的捍衛國家民族，取之於民者，用之於民深望諸君一面善體政府視民如子之心，一面廣導民衆，以犧牲爲國之義，策勵人民，恪遵法令，監督政府，杜絕貪婪，關山修阻，晤對莫由，特佈所懷，願相共勉。</p>
<h3>軍調部中空氣沉滯　晉共軍廣泛進攻　太原大同陷於四面包圍</h3>
<p>〔本報北平廿四日電〕停戰展期八日之命令，執行部已轉頒各小組遵照，但協和醫院中似仍樂無觀空氣，官方發言人指陳目前山西情勢之嚴重，已甚於山東，太原東南問浦正太交接點之檢次，刻正被圍攻。太原以西通往文水交城之公路，亦被破壞，太原殆已陷於四面楚歌狀態。朔縣陷後，大同惟一通往國軍駐防都市之聯絡，亦被切斷，火同殆已成爲雁門關外之孤島。晋南方面，共軍繼續圍攻曲沃，絳縣形勢亦甚緊急。山東方面共軍正圖進攻靑島之水源黃埠，樊家莊，濟南則周圍之糧道俱被阻塞，形勢亦復可慮。平綏綫上之共軍頗有包團南口趨勢，聶榮臻所部一萬五千人，一部進攻楊坊，一路進攻南口以西之白家口，有切斷平綏綫模樣。官方發言人並指出東北仍有小衝突，對展期八日屆滿後，時局將如何發展，發言人拒加評論，僅頻答「難說」不止。</p>
<p>〔本報北平廿四日電〕大同執行小組中共代表已撤離大同，官方謂此爲共軍完成包圍網，即開始進攻之先聲。</p>
<p>又，共軍攻入聞嘉時，縣長伍德明等多人殉職。</p>
<p>〔本報濟南廿三日電〕濟市外圍各據點，漸有展開，共軍向後撤退，惟共軍人數續有增加，似有侵攻濟市企圖。又大汶口趙廣與團，仍據核心堅守，廿二日夜會被共軍炸毀地下壕，情形危急，經拼死抵禦，始轉安。</p>
<h3>共軍掘運河堤　冀南慘遭水淹</h3>
<p>〔合衆社北平廿四日電〕據天津傳來政府方面報吿稱：河北東南部廣大地區，已被淹沒，其原因係由於共軍掘開天津南九十哩泊頭鎭以西之運河堤岸所致。報吿中稱：該區農作物及房舍已受嚴重損害。</p>
<h3>毛澤東發表言論　反對美軍事援華</h3>
<p>〔聯合社北平廿四日電〕毛澤東昨在延安公關發表言論表示，中共堅決反對六月十五日美國務院提交國會之繼續軍事援華議案。又謂美國軍事援華，實係武裝干涉。中國人民迫切需求者，並非美國武器及駐軍中國。在此種情况之下，中共祇得反對美政府繼續以武器供給國民黨政府及美國派遣軍事代表團來華，更要求美國立刻停止所謂對華軍事援助，及撤退其駐華軍隊云。</p>
<h3>暹米二萬餘噸　將運華救糧荒</h3>
<p>〔中央社新加坡廿三日專電〕據東南亞糧食局稱：暹米二萬六千六百噸，將於十日內運往中國作聯總救濟中國糧荒之用。</p>

<h3>蘇高法院發表裁定書　褚逆民誼獲准再審　理由基於保全國父靈臟及遺著</h3>
<p>〔本報蘇州廿四日電〕褚逆民誼，自經最高法院覆判裁定判決死刑，核准業已匝月，各界俱預料其伏法在邇，而其妻褚陳舜貞，忽復於陳逆公博就刑之翌日，向蘇高院聲請再審，當時社會輿情，咸表駭異，因事無先例，認為必遭駁斥，蘇高院自接獲是項再審聲請狀及各種新反證後，經原審人員數度會議研究，於廿四日下午三時許，發表再字第四號刑事裁定書，主文：「本件開始再審」，理由另錄，記者聞訓後，特往訪謁原審審判長孫鴻　氏·據告：褚逆之再審裁定，係基於其保全國父靈臟及遺著，不能謂無微功，設屬正確，自應援引為减刑之理由，以示法律毋枉毋縱；至外傳有美國人緩頓一說，全罷子處，擬有其事，本院亦絕不能因此而變更其刑責也。</p>
<p>再審理由</p>
<p>查被告因漢奸案件，於本院判決後，業經最高法院覆判核准。茲聲請人以被告曾於民國卅一年間，赴平向日軍交涉，領回國父靈臟，恭迎來京，奉安於陵園。國父生前在上海住宅所臟遺著遺物，均因日軍查封，當經被告力爭，始得將查封物件有關歷史性者，如國父遺著「孫文學說」原稿，及建國大綱，由國之革命等手書交還。又國父生前所佩之刀劍，亦係由被告妥為保仔。以上事實，有南京寗海　看守所詳細記錄可　，初判對於此項有利於被告之重要證據，漏未審酌，自得為再審之原因等情，聲請再審；本院按被告通敵謀叛，固屬罪有應得，但聲請人所述各節，如果屬實，則事關效忠國父，保存文獻，尚非無處理漢奸案件條例第三條之情形，原確定判決對於此點既未予以審酌，自應認為有再審之理由。據上論結，應依特種刑事案件訴訟條例第一條，第廿八條第二項，刑事訴訟法第四百二十八條第一項，裁定如主文。</p>

<h3>解決中國問題的基本觀念——對國共兩黨的呼籲並貢獻於調人自居的第三者——</h3>
<p>— 劉沐華</p>
<p>一</p>
<p>在停戰十五天滿期後再延展八天的期間，大家鬆一口氣，而一部分人便又因此存有奢望，以為共黨在這最後的機會中，態度或許可以轉變，一切困難問題未必不能得對一個勉強的解決。這種看法，固不能說沒有片面的理由，但如果我們切實想想中國目前的現實，想想隱在糾紛背後的社會以及國際政治的背景，便不難發現此種糢糊樂觀的膚淺。並且正因為一般人都是如此膚淺地去看，他們根本沒認識到問題本身的歷史的客觀條件之存在，反而更增加了局勢的嚴重困難。</p>
<p>要想解決目前的問題，非先明際國內問題的癥結究竟在什麼地方不可。換言之，現在我們所要問的是：政府和共黨所爭的究覓是什麼？那種爭執是不是可以用和平方法解決？更切實際地說，是：中國的革命是否可以在一黨專政之外尋求另一途徑？民生主義和共產主義究竟有多少距離？……這一些最根的本問題。</p>
<p>目前中國的內爭，簡言之，也就是國共兩黨的政爭。本質上，這政爭應該是主義的鬥爭，政策的鬥爭，方算合理。而實際兩黨以住從事於主義政策的爭執，反似比較的少。重慶舉行的政治協商會，除了通過憲草修改原則算有一點東西外，其餘所談的總離不開政府人員的分配，國大代表的分配，軍隊以及地盤的分配等等。或以為共黨目的就只在於分些「爵祿」，而他們軍事的活動不過是取得有利地位，以便討大價目云云。言外之意，便是說政府本也準備付出一筆代價，不過不能太大而已。果眞如此，似乎中國目前的問題未免太簡單了。無奈事實並不如所想的簡單容易。國共兩黨果眞能誠意合作，要共同參加國民政府的組織，彼此都放棄一黨專政與無產革命的政策的話，第一步必先求得溝通兩個主義，也就是兩黨的靈魂之橋樑。兩個革命政黨之合作，至少，要以具有大體相近的立場或政策為前提，否則便是貌合神離。何況國共兩是經過過合作而又分製了的，以前種種，誰也不易忘記。現在他們雙方如不在主義上政策上眞正尋去台作的共同的立場，反而請了「娘舅姑夫」，談判零星的分家，這一事實，無異說明國共雙方芥蒂很深，彼此不能相信對方的誠意，才更趨於現實。</p>
<p>然而中闕目前的局勢，究竟不能不設法打開？打開之法，就是恢復談判，再米一次政治協商會議，恐仍未必能勝任。不客氣地說，中國距離民主尚有相當路程，所謂「民意」始終還是在若隱若現之中。我敢斷定，縱然實行普選，仍脫不了去自的勢力圈。所以國大尚未開會。而共黨先在那裏爭代表多少了。筆者主張去掉一切掩護的虛套，堂堂正正就是國共兩黨挺身出來，開誠布公的談。凡兩黨以外的人，都是老老實實地做中間人，和事老；絕對不可有所偏袒，做尾巴更要不得。然後兩黨提出了最根本的問題，，從雙方的主義和政策上，從中國的客觀情勢上，建立起建國的共同路綫，方足以有裨實際。我敢說，現在只有這一條路政者可以行得通。</p>
<p>二</p>
<p>筆者主張去掉一切掩護物，由國共兩黨正面相對來解決糾紛，完全是鑒於歷史的以及國際政治的種種因素，覺得事實上應談如此，而且也還須如此。</p>
<p>就以「民主」一詞來說，現在全國人一致呼號民主，然而解釋起來似乎又不相同。中國自國民革命軍北伐時候起，政治上似己走上了蘇聯那條路子。現在經過了國民黨十幾年的「以黨治國」，事實上似已成了一種定型，而國民黨經過此次大戰，卻想轉舵再走英美式的民主道路。能不能？還在演進之中，未定之天。至於政黨方面，只有國民黨和共產黨，不但實力雄厚，而且各有其成為完整體系的主義，又有相當的歷史。其他小黨或政團，今尚難與競爭。在十幾年前。筆者心裏似乎己對中國未來的命運劃出三條路綫：（一）國民黨消滅了共產黨，完成其三民主義之建國方略；（三）共產黨奪得政權，無產階級專政，實行蘇維埃共產主義；（三）國共兩黨，由國際環境而引至各以普通政黨相待，大家攜手合作之途，共同實現類似社會主義的民生主義。而今天的局勢，益發證明了筆者以前的觀察大概正確。現在的中國，似乎正面臨着這三個歧途的交叉點而徬徨無主。但筆者現在卻又要更進一步來一個解釋，就是：由於國際政治的演變，第一第二兩條好綫都已不可能，不但中國國民不容許走，國際上更將不容許走，於是乎中國的前途只是一條大路，便是第三條路綫，而國民黨卻早表示願與其他黨派共同建國了，換言之，放棄了第一條路線了。</p>
<p>二十年來的陳跡不必說吧，我們且看目前的國際情勢。大戰結束之后，由於法西斯的滅亡，證實了希特拉之流的想把蘇聯的經濟形態安置在資本社會組織上面混合之那種企圖已告失敗，於是世界上很顯明的留下了兩個陣綫，對立起米。代表着兩種社會制度的美蘇兩個勢力，在大戰中可以合作，而在戰事終了以後，已無處迥避，終於對面了。美蘇對面之後，一方是安全理事會和外長會議一次次開會，另一面是伊朗問題，土耳其問題，巴爾幹問題，德義問題，東北問題，朝鮮問題等等頭痛的事實。實際上，這許問題還只是一個問題，便是蘇聯要在她國境四邊造成「安全地帶」，美國也同樣要在東西兩洋獲得安全保障，一切問題都不外這兩種「安全主義的矛盾」之反應。平心而論，美國既不需擴張領土，蘇聯也未必想侵略別人，他們誰也不願戰爭，但為了社會制度的相尅性，猜忌竟似乎不尅避免。反應着此種國際情勢的中國問題，說複雜就複雜，說簡單也簡單，無論美蘇任何一方面造成了絕對控制中國的局面，將為對方所不許。而中國國內的和平問題，也就反映了世界的和平問題。筆者並非說國共兩黨在利用了國際背景作政爭只是說他們的政爭，處處都在牽動着國際關係。</p>
<p>從這種國際關係中發展而來的中國的革命，不論是三民主義的革命或共產主義的革命，己發生了內在的轉變，那便是一黨專政的革命策略在今日中國已不可能。國民黨固已見到如此，表示要放棄它以前那種「以黨治國」的方式．同時共產黨縱想乘機奪取政權，也不能無所顧忌了。如果國共兩黨都衷心地放葉「一黨專政」的意圖，不再走第一或第二條路綫，則一切問題宜可迎刃而解。</p>
<p>所以國際情勢並不令人悲觀，毋寗說倒是有利於中國，至少它給國共兩黨減少了相尅的主觀條件，提供出一個共同的路綫，那便是依照國際現狀，國共攜手合作之一途。</p>
<p>三</p>
<p>真正成為國共合作之前途障碍的，筆者以為不是主義或政策上有什麼絕對不能調和的地方。因為主義不是公式，政策更具有彈性，儘有伸縮餘地。何況三民主義的民生主義，如果真能澈底實現的話，如孫中山先生所說，已經是社會主義了，而共產主義也只是社會主義的一種。依毛澤東氏的主張，中國的革命應先求實現新民主主義，而共產黨宣言也稱願為三民主義而奮鬥，如果真的話，則在理論方面，思想方面，我們根本找不出共黨此時不擁護國民政府的理由。可見如果合作起來，兩黨的政策儘有互相容納的可能。</p>
<p>那麼究竟什麼是他們合作的障碍呢？唯一的便是疑忌！國共兩黨自北伐中途分裂之後，經過了南昌·廣州的幾次共黨暴動，經過了政府的長期圍剿，彼此的關係本已十分惡劣，互不信任，合作上已經佈滿了暗礁。更不幸的是，這次政爭自開始的一天為始，執政的國民黨固始終站在政府的立場，不免指斥共黨的行動，而擁兵的共產黨，尤其始終沒又忘懷擴大地盤為政爭資本的打算。輿論界也似乎各有這種「主觀」的存在，有時更加甚了國共之間的疑忌。所以筆者痛切地感到雙方宣傳戰之不能不停，而一般人不認識問題的本質，不清楚中國現局關鍵之所在，夾在中間瞎鬧是非，實在是給予國家前途以最可怕的影響。</p>
<p>欲使國共誠意合作，完成民主的憲政國家，最少有兩個前提觀念必須肯定：第一，我們得承認在野的共產黨和執政的國民黨具有同等的政治地位；我們得承認共黨的一切行動，也是為了實現他的主義，實現他的政策，而從事於政爭，不過它採的方法有待考慮。第二，我們得承認中國的革命尚未成功，封建勢力，官僚資本，買辦階級，腐化份子，仍然在到處活躍。共黨的行動的確太過火了點，各地共軍的行動也許更離開了共黨的原意，但以恕道論人，共黨未必不以為它是代表了中國平民大衆的要求。無可諱言的，國民黨自執政以後，十八九年的光陰，除了抗戰時期確實領導全民救了國家之外，其餘大部分力量都用在鞏固政權與黨內的政爭上，而有時且不免與他以前革命的對象相妥協。即以目前而言，政治相當的無效率。對經濟沒辦法，還可以說是條件太不足，情有可原；可是吏治呢，經過了八年抗戰，還連個廉潔的政治都未必能確實做到。所以我們得承認共產黨之膨脹，一方面是由於二十年來日本帝國主義在外壓迫之所賜，一方面也多少是國民黨政治無能的結果。我們尤其得承認，多少優秀青年之投身於延安，被騙於共黨，並非由於他們信仰馬克思主義、更不是對三民主義不相信，他們只是要革命，要打倒封建勢力，官僚資本，和一切不光明的現象而已。只要國民黨認真革命，實在做到「政府有能」，青年何所愛於共產黨！</p>
<p>筆者相信共黨的人們對於國際情勢萬不容許其爆發革命這一點，比我們理解得更清楚而且深刻。不然的話，他們儘不必和政府要求什麼，直截了當地革命好了。唯其共產革命在中國確為事實所不許，確是行不通，它才和國民黨打打而又想談談。今天的中心問題，不外要求政府執行三民主義的革命政策而已。我們要記住：政府實踐了革命，根本不會看到共產黨的膨脹；而號稱革命卻違反人民的利益，也就根本不會有它的前途</p>
<p>解鈴還是繫鈴人。國共兩黨現在仍然要在革命路綫上尋求合作的橋樑。國民黨必須清算自己一下，使廣東政府時代的革命精神復活起來；共產黨也要清算自己一下，一些殺人放火的過火作風和南昌廣州的暴動政策，不可重蹈覆轍。為了實現民生主義，為了建設平等自由的中國，為了打倒封建勢力和官僚資本，為了解放中國人民，他們雙方更沒有理由不接近，不合作。</p>
<p>任何一個問題，正如我們算繁分數一樣，必須使其逐步簡單化，始有解決之可能。</p>
<p>現在一般人對於當前的問題，最缺少的是一種歸納的工作。政協會的沒有多大成就，便是為此。筆者個人的想法，最好是讓第三者先退後一步，把問題集中在國共兩黨的革命路綫上，作為解決政爭的大前提。只要國民黨共產黨仿然願做統一的革命政策的推動者，而第三者的人們，規規矩矩都是公正的見證人，同時也就是維持等重的法碼，這樣，國共兩黨與國內各方面共同為政，他們的主義和政策，儘可以取決於法碼而調和起米見於實行，中國的政治才有出路。不革命固然沒有出路，國共兩黨不統一革命路綫也還是國家吃虧。這完全是事實的看法，與理論本相干。</p>
<p>國共兩黨如能真正在政治上合作，把鬥爭放在各個政策上，是中國最迫切需要的了。就以土地政策來說，國民黨可以提出平均地權的實施方案，共產黨也不妨主張土地收為國有，那麼最後取決於人民的代表，那就是民主政治的實現。姑不論人民的決策如何，國共兩黨只要肯和和平平地如此做，我想一定沒有人不同情。因為中國人民不是怕革命，怕的只是不革命，反革命，假革命；但中國人民也不希望暴動流血的革命，他們經不起再流一次血了！</p>
<p>我們還主張不以某一定型來規範中國的政治以及社會之未來的形態。中國既不會成為英美，也不會成為蘇聯，中國永遠應該是中國的。民族的傳統尤其不容輕視。中國向近代所要求的是營養，是各種質素，而不是人家的定型。國共合作之後的中國政治，應該是政府提出政策，取決於人民，然後再由政府付之實施，而不是蘇聯的政府形態，或英美刻板的政府形態。國民黨，共產黨，以及其他種種的什麼黨，都可以盡量在各種政策上努力於其思想主義之實現，中國人民自會選擇他們所需要的東西。掛羊頭，賣狗肉，決不能取信於中國人民。</p>
<p>總之，中國問題的關鍵就在這裏。離開了中國的革命問題—這是中國大眾唯一的要求—離開了國共兩黨的歷史以及現實關係，不能解決糾紛，徒然多生枝節。</p>
<p>要想軍隊國家化，非國共誠意合作不可；要想國共合作，非先確立統一的革命路綫不可。</p>
<p>馬歇爾特使，以及參加了政協會的所謂第三者人們，似乎對這後一點還應有充分的認識。就是國共兩黨的負責人，也似乎很沙願意觸及這根本間題。因此，筆者膽敢把這個基本觀念貢獻與他們之前。</p>

<h3>特港問題能否妥協　外長會議成敗所繫　靜候莫斯科方面新訓令　昨日上下午開會議兩次</h3>
<p>〔路透社巴黎廿四日電〕四國外長會議之成敗關鍵，繫於今日之兩次集會，尤需視義大利與南斯拉夫所爭之特里埃斯特港之將來能否商定一折衷辦法爲斷。星期五下午之秘密非正式會議，及該晚貝爾納斯與莫洛托夫晚餐時所秘密交換之意見，似仍無妥協之象徵。今會議全局所關之特港問題，將視週杪莫斯科方面有何新訓令，及英美能否讓步亦接呼國際共管之議而定其前途。倘莫斯科斷然拒絕國際共管，則會議議程中所餘各項問題，將更難商獲成議，尤難邀得蘇聯方面召開全面和平會離之同意。</p>
<p>〔聯合社巴黎廿三日電〕特里埃斯特港國際化計劃，聞係法總統兼外長皮杜爾於本月廿一日四外長秘密會議中提出。按照此項計劃，特港歸聯合國管轄，爲期十年，期滿舉行公民投票，決定該港是否應歸義大利或南斯拉夫。就非官方消息觀之，折衷計劃對於義南邊界爭執，影響如何，尚未明瞭。四外長為加緊草擬對義和約起見，已定今晨及午後舉行兩次會議，議程中包括法國與奧地利對義大利之邊界問題，及義國剩餘軍艦之處置問題等。惟觀察家相信特港問題將儘先討論。</p>
<p>〔聯合社羅馬廿四日電〕義大利總理加斯貝利今日公佈文吿稱：「任何和平解決，將使特里埃斯特港受國際共管，及將伊斯特里亞區西部割讓予南斯拉夫者，義國均將竭其全力反抗之。」此種解決辦法，殊屬不公，吾人雖然荏弱無力，手無寸鐵，但決不忍受吾人之權利遭受摧殘」。</p>
<h3>原子能委會席上　美蘇將展開激辯</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦廿四日電〕明日聯台國原子能委員會之辯論，可能損及巴黎四國外長會議集議一週後所產生之樂觀空氣。安理會成立之初，即知會中之決議，可以反映諸强間之基本關係。今原子能委會之決議，對於外畏會議顯然亦有重大影響。此由美蘇兩國代表向原子能委會所提計劃根本不同一點可以見之。預料美國在獲得如其計劃所言之確切保證前，當不願遽即銷燬原子彈或公布其秘密，而蘇代表葛羅米柯恐亦不擬接受此項保證。明日之辯論，勢必使美蘇之計劃，達到衝突之局面。</p>
<p>〔聯合社倫敦廿三日電〕英國聯合國同志會今日舉行全體大會，以絕大多數議決反對美國所提國際管理原子能計劃，贊成蘇聯提案。</p>

<h3>聯合國安理會開會　辯論西班牙問題</h3>
<p>波蘭提案必遭否決無疑</p>
<p>〔聯合社紐約廿四日電〕聯合國安理會定於今日開會，將波蘭要求全世界與弗朗哥政府絕交案提付表決，各國代表已準備出席討論，觀其表示，波蘭在十一票中至多能得四票，此案將被否決。但聞波蘭代表朗琪尚擬採取兩項行動，即將西班牙案保留於安理會議程，並阻止提交九月間舉行之聯合國大會。</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓廿三日電〕前任國務副卿威爾斯今日在此聞廣播稱，安理會辯論西班牙問題，實爲蘇聯與英國，甚至蘇聯與西方各國互瑯據點之鬥爭。弗朗哥政府若遭推翻，西班牙諒將發生內戰，而共黨支配之政府將取得控制權，果爾，西班牙殆將分裂，而英國對蘇彝士運河及地中海各處軍事設備之交通，有遭截斷可能。此外，法國義大利及北非之共黨勢力，將得西班牙新政府之直接援助而頓時增强。</p>
<h3>印國大黨執委會　拒絕英建議　英代表仍圖挽救　免致談判陷決裂</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦廿四日廣播：印度國大黨執行委員會，已拒絕英方所提有關印度臨時政府之建議。</p>
<p>〔聯合社新德里廿四日電〕今日消息：英內閣訪印團因成立印度臨時政府之計劃，必將遭大會黨拒絕，故已提出最後一分鐘之新建議，以免談判決裂。傳英代表勞倫斯·克里浦斯·與國大會黨代表甘地·巴德爾會議一小時，對此新建議已加討論。會議旣畢，甘地怱怱趕至國大黨執委會，出席晨間會議。前傳該會已準備通過決議案拒絕英方計劃惟會議歷二小時半結束後，並無意料中之決　案公佈，致引起外界猜測。　爲該會對於印度臨時政府之形式，或已商獲協議。會議後大會黨總戴阿柴特吿新聞記者稱，「今日稍有新發展，或問局勢是否有望？阿氏笑答，一君可自下結論」。按阿氏昨日對談判前途顯抱悲觀。</p>
<p>甘地阿柴特分別發宣言</p>
<p>〔聯合社新德里廿三日電〕印度國大黨主席阿柴特與印敎徒精神領袖甘地，今晚分別發表宣言，聲明拒絕英國提議組織臨時政府。阿柴特之宣言係在國大黨　委會開會三小時後發表，據稱，「就國大黨方面而言，此事現已終了」。甘地則於晚　會中致詞稱，「我等勿期待英內閣代表團，而應自已組成一內閣代表團，以發揮其領導權及權力，我等不能在倉猝中建立自由，亦不能在倉猝中獲得之。我等必須堅毅忍耐前進」。國大黨主席尼赫魯曾與印督魏菲爾及英閣代表團會談九十分鐘，迨舉行委員會議時，甘地亦曾出席。</p>

<h3>輻射性同位原素　可用以探索病源</h3>
<p>原子能又一用途</p>
<p>〔美國新聞處華感頓廿三日電〕自陸軍部最近發表無綫電同位原素可用於生物學及醫學上之研究後，戰時原子研究之結果，立即可能作第一次平時之運用。此種同位原素將被運用於基本科學與實用科學之研究工作，尤其在生物學與醫學方面，此等有益之無綫電同位原素將來自田納西州奧克山脈實騐室之「原子堆」中，並將分配於全美，作科學之應用。同位原素在醫學方面所能產生之利益，至少在初起時，並非直接治療，但作為探索病源之工具，在目下所宣佈之計劃下，約可獲得一百種容量各不相同有輻射能之同位原素。</p>
<h3>艾帥發表歷史性報告　分析盟軍在歐戰績　三大戰役決定德軍命運　英美實力超過蘇聯兩倍</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓廿三日電〕陸軍參謀長艾　成　爾今日向聯合參謀團提出一百廿三頁之長篇報吿書，叙述其在歐洲聯軍統帥任內，指揮軍隊自諾曼第攻至埃爾白河之戰史。報吿書內稱，歐戰之勝利，由三大決戰確定，此乃聯合國之實力合作，及德國之錯誤使然。戰爭在渡越萊因河以前，即已獲勝。希特勒及倫台特對聯合國軍隊登陸日期算錯一着，因而集中主力於對付英國，以待永不再臨之第二次襲擊，敵人死守其以自擇陣地迎擊敵人之戰略，因此入我　中。自登陸日至勝利日十一個月間，三大戰役如下：</p>
<p>諾曼第登陸戰　敵軍在該處受困於供應與交通之不便，交通綫破壞卒成其致命打擊。敵方因空軍力薄及偵察之缺乏，完全被我方聲東擊西之牽制戰路所迷，未能調動加萊方面之軍隊，直至後悔莫及。此項軍隊如在我軍登陸之初，即衝過塞納河攻至海灘，則大局或將與我不利。</p>
<p>袋形陣地之戰　當時自各種軍事邏韓言之，敵軍宜作戰路的撤退，但敵方不此之圖，而欲死守到底，因此坐令第七第被圍，擊成粉碎。法蘭西爭奪戰乃在諾曼第鮮血淋漓之菓國地帶決定。</p>
<p>萊因西岸戰役　在一九四五年二三月間該處敵軍原欲保衛德國，但被擊至潰不能成軍。要之，就全部戰局觀之，跑國不能充分　持其軍隊之　應、乃其致命傷。敵人士氣確甚旺盛，但僅憑士氣不足濟事。關於此層，吾人對於聯合國空軍之任務，最爲感傳。以聯合國實力而論，在渡越萊因河前夕，本人所部軍隊幾近四百萬之衆，外加近一萬一千架戰鬥機與轟炸機，英美兩大海軍合而爲一，實力雄厚，世無其匹，在戰鬥部隊後方，尚有穿制服之男女輔助隊員三百萬人。</p>
<p>充滿合作精神　英美兩國之合作，不僅本於聯合國精神，甚至如同一國，共同傾注其資源·人力·物力·蘇聯方面較爲困難。截至一九四四年底。余於蘇聯戰略，並未接到報吿，……但至翌年一月，始自史達林元帥處接悉蘇聯四路進攻詳細計劃，用兵一百五十師乃至一百六十師，所獲勝利之大，出乎始料之外。歐戰末期，統帥部所轄九十師兵力，大部份由戰車。高射砲及其他附屬部隊聯合作戰。德國投降時，余所部共九十師，每師約一萬七千名，較蘇聯各師團實力超過兩倍。</p>
<h3>外長會議暗礁重重　義南兩國糾紛全貌</h3>
<p>特港主權問題為爭論焦點</p>
<p>自從一九四五年第一次四國外長會議以來，對義和約問題始終是癥結之一，迄未得到全部解決，目前巴黎四國外長會議正在研究如何達成協議的方案。本文譯自「外交政策公報」，專述義大利與南斯拉夫的邊界問題，綜合雙万爭辯的意見，是很重要的參考材料。</p>
<p>在一九四五年七月波茨坦會議席上，三强同意成立外長會議，在倫敦開會，「起草與義、羅、保、芬等國簽訂的和約，並提供解決歐洲戰事結束時各主要領土問題。」協議特別强調稱，「對義和約的準備爲該新會議應即進行之重要任務。」一九四五年九月外長會議開始，幾經磋商，終於破裂，並未達成任務，同年十二月三外長於莫斯科一次會議中，決定分別授權其次長立即在倫敦恢復工作，以便擬定和約草案，俾向預定一九四六年五月一日舉行的和平會議提出，以後限期雖已到達，調處對義和約異議的工作並無進展。三強的異議多半發生於賠款，義屬殖民地的處置，義甫重訂新國界等諸間題。關於非常複雜的義南邊界紛爭，偷敦會議曾有協議，略謂「界綫主要應根據對於人種的考慮來決定，不論主權如何，特里埃斯特應爲國際共管的自由港。」這協議雖然提供了一個協調的公式，但是問題的中心還未接觸到。義南兩國對於「人種的考慮」有很大的異議，因此這話還須有公平而正確的定義，向時兩國對主權都有要求，「主權」一詞也須有個淸楚的決定。當一九四六年一月外次會議對這問題再度討論時，它決定派遣特別委員會到特里埃斯特，研究各方爭執的領土要求，並在和會以前作成具體的建議。但是委員會能否爲問題的解決打破難關，頗可懷疑，因此人們不免認爲三强所以有此決議，無非爲了拖延問題必須解決的日子而已。</p>
<p>對義和約問題果眞能把各個爭端一一擺開，同時也沒有在東歐與東地中海爭取　權的因素存在，解決一定比較簡易而迅速，歐洲的問題雖可一個個處理，可是它們都有着無可分離的連系，義大利問題的解決，顯然關乎大戰中形成的新的均勢，最基本的一點是：訛可以分享地中海與亞得利亞海的勢力範圍，而主要的利益該如何分配？由此看來，所有的黎波里坦尾亞與厄利特里亞的託治要求，希臘與多德喀尼斯羣島的將來，義大利的賠償，以及義南新邊境之類的問題，都是糾纏在一起的。而疆界糾紛中的焦點就是特田埃斯特，特港位於亞德里亞海之顛，伊斯特里亞半島的西海岸，不過發生爭執的地方包括着戰前戰後不同的邊境所牽連的區域，這區域義人稱之爲「維尼齊亞—里亞」，這區城面積三千五百方哩，人口約一百萬，按義方估計：其中南斯拉夫人六十萬，義大利人四十萬，按南方估計：南斯拉夫人六十五萬，義人二十五萬。</p>
<p>雙方爭執的要求</p>
<p>這兩年來，局勢變動十分劇烈，南斯拉夫與義大利就不斷在為維尼齊亞—求里亞的問題爭論，雙方各執一詞，相持不決，但他們的意見大體可分述如左：</p>
<p>南斯拉夫的要求　曾於一九三五年九月外長會議時，由副總理卡德爾提出備忘錄，記述得十分詳盡，該備忘錄要求南國與義大利的疆界向西擴展，以由亞德里亞海邊的蒙發康城南開始向北延展至維巴古與伊遜乍兩河會合處，然後有一短段沿伊遜乍河北延，再按泰辛托公路向西北，至達義奧蘭界之終點爲止一線爲新國界，如南國這一要求實現，義大利的處境當還不如一九一四年與奧地利接攘的時候，而南斯拉夫將吸收了三十五萬至四十萬的義大利人。南斯拉夫的備忘錄以及各正式非正式補充性的談話所提的理由可綜述如左：（一）南國所要求的地區按人口說來，南方大半斯洛文尼亞人，北方大多是克羅提亞人。因此斯克兩族人口加起來，在該區人口中佔大多數，而斯拉夫人正是南斯拉夫的國族，在人口中占最大多數，按全境的情形來說，南國所提要求大體上是正確的，不過南方還說所提統計包括着一九一〇年奧地利所作的數字，它並不千眞萬確地說明當前的情况，他們指出按所操語言來　定種族關係的調查法，已使義方人口較實際數字爲多，他們估計，全區人口九十七萬，南斯拉夫人不下六十五萬之多。（二）至於特里埃斯將港，南方認爲這城市「全部依存於它的內地，一而內地却不是義大利而是南斯拉夫的。雖然如所公認特港的大部人口都被稱爲義大利人，但人口顯然非常混雜，由於全港爲斯拉夫人的四郊所包圍，它的斯拉夫成份正日趨增漲，而且大戰期間特港義人也多支持解放軍的運動，足以表明他們歸從南斯拉夫的願望，無論如何，南斯拉夫決意使特港成爲南斯拉夫聯邦中的一個自治邦，其權利與其他自治單位同，因此義人當仍有其自己的政府，而它的民族權利也得到保陣。此外特港的經濟繁榮，只有它成爲南斯拉夫的一部分時才有實現可能。商埠由國際共管，已不乏先例，一特港的國際共管，決非解決問題的辦法。」（三）南斯拉夫爲戰勝國之忠義盟邦，對這塊土地自有它戰勝者的權利。</p>
<p>義大利提出的要求　遠不如南斯拉夫的明確，按義外長加斯貝里向外長會議提出的備忘錄，義大利政府顯然採行着協商的方針。它申明爲了歐洲的團結與重建，持別爲了義南兩國建立友好的關係，願意有所犧牲，它承認義大利與南斯拉夫作戰是有罪的，但它也指出義大利人民並不要這塲戰爭。加斯貝里稱：關於疆界紛爭，義大利願意接受國際調停，但希望解決的辦法能爲「民主政府」所接受。他說明了義大利人民所認爲公平的解決辦法，即「威爾遜綫」是大體合理的，按「威爾遜綫」劃界，特里埃斯特當留給義大利，義大利希望與其他有意利用該港的國家獲得協議，要求不使特港與郊區斷絕關係，不使它與波拉失却鐵路聯系，阜姆回復其「隔離的一部」的地方；南境義大利人應得到適當保護，南義同時在鄰近海岸解除武裝。他曾特別呼籲阿薩煤礦的權利，因該礦供給義全部煤產百分之卅，同時呼籲爲義鋁業必需的鐵　土礦，他指出義大利已是這兩宗物資的輸出者。義大利要求的理由是：一，義大利雖在法西斯政權統治時期犯了錯誤，但是它於最後得勝時期，曾對聯合國效忠，並有它重要的貢獻。因此它不應被當作戰敗國處理，相反應視作合作的盟友，自然這是一個司法上的論點，在義大利參與軸心時期，盟方是決不會考慮到的。二，使義大利民族剝奪了數十萬人民，特別是使它喪失特里埃斯特的主權，將造成義國人民的怨恨，因此使「民主政府」不可實現，並使將來南義關係非常不和。總而言之，南斯拉夫雖說它的主張是該區人民公意，但它並不建議舉行公民投票。公民投票也許能使問題有個眞正的答案，但能否舉行又是個大問題。（美國新聞處）</p>
<h3>原子彈試騐期近　昨作最後投彈演習　試驗費用不致超出五億美元</h3>
<p>〔聯合社比基尼島上空B—29型機廿四日電〕原子彈試騐即將舉行，試騐人員史溫克德少校等於今日作最後一次試飛，向靶子艦那伐達號投下演習彈一枚，相當準確。前四次試飛時均在距目標五百呎以內投演習彈，惟今日舉負責原子彈試騐之白期第海軍中將命令，在六百呎天空投彈。史溫克德少校座機「台芙之夢」從瓜加林島起飛時，陸軍航隊上尉一人，不慎觸及旋轉如風之推進機，頓時殞命。</p>
<p>〔聯合社比基尼珊瑚島廿三日電〕裝載原子彈之B—29刑機，最後試飛原定廿二日舉行，嗣因氣候惡劣，乃改期至廿四日。</p>
<p>〔又電〕美海軍當局昨爲原子彈試騐費辯護，否認支出將超過五億美元，即使試騐費包括多數船隻·人員，供應及其他各種因素，與戰時部隊規模相仿，亦不致有此數。海軍中校裘林稱：費用之估計，非至試騐司令白朗第提出最後報吿時不擬發表，但其毛數當較「愛和華」級主力艦之造價爲低，約合一億一千萬美元。吾人經此試駝之敎訓，將來可以節省無數生命。艦船與金元。靶子艦值價四億美元一說，亦難承認，此乃全部建造費之估計，但此項軍艦大部份已毫無價值，若照廢鐵出售，七十七艘靶子艦，不過值五百五十萬美元而已。</p>
<h3>新式V2火箭　可達百哩高空</h3>
<p>定本月廿七試放</p>
<p>〔美國新聞處華盛頓廿三日電〕美陸軍軍械局六月廿七日在新墨西哥白沙試騐塲，施放第六枚V2火箭彈時，將創昇空紀錄。海陸軍部聯合研究人員，將靜觀此滿　實騐紀錄儀器之火箭彈，冲入離子層。預計火箭彈可到達一百英哩之高空，此一帶高空僅於觀察陽光，極光，隕石及無綫電波反應時，始爲人所知悉。</p>
<h3>美國西海岸地震</h3>

<h3>暹故王致命彈　係從正面射入</h3>
<p>開棺檢騐結果</p>
<p>〔聯合社曼谷廿一日電〕（遲到）官方宣佈，故王馬希道爾屍體，經開棺檢驗，用愛克司光照射結果，證明致命之槍彈從正面射入，而不如外傳之從後面射入。按外間謠傳國王係暗殺致死，故有檢騐之舉。</p>
<h3>為應付近代化戰爭　美需保持堅强實力　開辦情報軍校早就人才</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦廿三日電〕紐約電台稱：美軍司令長官台弗斯將軍頃發表演說稱，欲在將來戰爭中救菠美國，惟需具有立可出動之極大防務實力，倘美國能在軍事上處於堅强地位，則可防止敵人報復性之侵略威脅。將來戰爭中，美軍需至深入敵國心臟區域，擊潰其軍隊及奪獲其軍事設備後，始能終止其火箭攻擊及投彈轟炸，故美國需常保堅强云。</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓廿三日電〕海長福萊斯時爾今日宣稱，組織嚴密訓練精良之情報機構，對於戰爭，可操決定勝負之權。海軍部爲充實知己知彼之策路起見，定七月一日開辦情報軍官處校，以資造就人才。</p>

<p>谷部長　繼之報吿視察經過，稱其在各地巡視時，腦中充滿悽慘及憤慨情緒，今能得各界熱心援助，無任欣慰。蔣主席對於蘇北難胞，極爲關切與同情，派本席注意救濟，現得各地地方士紳協助，工作在短時期內已有相當發展，其救濟原則分爲三段：（一）通力合作，把政府及社會力量統一配合起來。（二）標本兼施，一面救濟一面恢復生產。（三）切實迅速，所有救濟財物務必多用在難民身上，早日辦理，救災如救火。關於機構方面，在通力合作原則下成立蘇北難民救濟會，決定救濟方針，及物資分配等事。在徐州·揚州·海州·南通·泰州各地設辦事處，配合地方機構展開工作。關於救濟工作，舉辦難民招待所，難民食堂，醫院，治療所，醫務隊，小本借貨，職業介紹等。物資捐款除中央所發一部份外，發動社會辦理，對於保管，稽核等，另設財務委員會掌理其事。</p>
<p>救濟工作人員，凡有舞弊情事者，應公開檢舉，告發者可得三萬至三萬元之獎金，難胞中有冒名頂替被檢舉後，吿發人可得一萬至五萬元之獎金，中央已撥發救濟設施經費十億元，麵粉五千噸，約二十三萬袋，計徐州六萬九千噸，揚州，海州，銀江各三萬六千噸，南通，泰州各五百噸，餘者分發其他各地。衛生醫藥設備亦已擴充，設立防疫，傳染等病院，現蘇北各縣受災流亡難胞據估計約有三百萬人，已登記者計一百零二萬人。彼等皆係在蘇北受共黨「三資鬥爭」而被鬥爭出來的，希望本市同胞，有錢出錢，有糧出糧，有屋讓屋，此次籌款目標，擬定二十億至五十億元。至蘇北的災難，旣非天災，又非國難，而是共產黨造成的人禍，故我們決不能坐視。</p>
<p>王主席　繼之致詞，首先代表蘇北難胞向江蘇同胞致謝，並謂蘇北難民，餓莩遍地，我們要大聲疾呼，速送難胞回家；救濟靑年，不使他們落在土匪手中。要使共黨知道江蘇人不好欺，不使其達到社會不安定，人民無飯吃之目的。現軍委會政治部已收留難胞靑年一萬人，教育部收留三千五百人，盼上海同胞慷慨解囊，不但予以物質救濟，且給予精神協助</p>
<p>繼由蘇北難民代表祁伯席報吿受災經過，聲淚俱下，在坐者爲之酸鼻。除要求救濟衣食住外，並請求谷部長，王主席轉呈蔣主席要求「還鄉」。報吿後不久，有流亡靑年百餘人集合門外請願，經谷部長，王主席親自向彼等慰問後，羣呼獲擁中央口號而退</p>

<h3>大風助勢撲救困難　英文大美晚報發生火警　成阿米葬身火窟三人失踪　光藝製版公司起火釀巨災</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨天下午，正在狂風猛襲上海的時候，上海發生了勝利以後最大的一次火警。</p>
<p>下午一點四十分，愛多亞路十七十九兩號的英文大美晚報館三樓，突然起火。那時正值大風，在十五分鐘裏，三層樓上的火舌已經由西到東，成爲一片火海！</p>
<p>大美晚報的記者王瑩，剛剛吃好了飯，在三樓休息。他還沒有知道已經被火熖三面包圍，祗聽見下面人聲鼎沸，趕快望窗外一者，方才知道發生了火警，三樓的過路上已經全是濃烟了。樓下，有幾個大美晚報的工友拿了一塊卡車上的布兜蓬，張開着，好像準備有人跳下來的樣子，但是這本來祇是防備萬一而已，三層樓上跳下去實在相當危險。然而他先丟下了一隻箱子，竟然跳了下來！</p>
<p>馬路上早已站滿了觀衆，其中有不少是大美晚報的職員，眼看着他跳下來，大家不禁緊閉了眼睛——但是，這位王瑩先生福星高照，居然毫無損傷，「安全着陸」！</p>
<p>大美晚報的排字工友成榮明正在工作，一聽三樓着火，馬上衝到三樓上他所住的房間裏去。他拚命拖出了他的妻子，可是，他三歲的兒子成阿米，却竟來不及搶出來，眼睜睜看他葬身火窟了。</p>
<p>到昨夜十點鐘爲止，失踪的還有一位瘋癲在床上的樸蔡氏（五十三歲），還有她的七歲孫女樸品芳。大美晚報發行部程君的五歲幼子程祥生，也還生死未卜。不知在什麼地方。</p>
<p>報館的二樓盡是水漬，可是大美晚報的機器和紙張竟然並沒有什麼損失。不但如此，昨天的火美晚報居然照常出版，用報館火警的新聞做了頭條新聞！</p>
<p>大美晚報的編輯部在底層，一切文件打字機之類全部完整無恙。祇是三樓上堆着不少參考資料，却全付一炬了。</p>
<p>這一幢大厦的主人是字林西報的主人莫理思，房子已經相當舊了，是上海最老的建築物之一。有一個時期那裏曾開過一個極豪華的大賭塲。大美晚報是一九二九年搬進去的。三樓租戶頗多，昨天燒掉的，有大美電台，紐約時報辦事處，光藝製版公司，還有一些大美職員的宿舍。大美電台總經理鄭肇基，經理王彥存表示，播音在十天內可以恢復。</p>
<p>這次大火連燒了兩小時，到晚上、黃浦分局的探員潘志冲和王長元，已經查出是光藝製版公司起火的。</p>
<p>昨天最早趕到的是河南路救火會，但因風勢太大，無法施救。後來，本市各救火會差不多全體出動，先後抵達的救火車有十二輛之多。美軍消防隊和警察憲兵也都到了，總算在狂風中撲滅了一塲浩刧，仁濟醫院在晚上收到了一只肥皂箱，箱子裏躺着成阿米小小的尸體。</p>

<h3>被毆學生　向吳市長請願　要求懲兇賠償</h3>
<p>前日本市學生工人約近萬人，舉行反「內戰」遊行，於行經大世界附近，有若干學生由高樓上散發傳單，遊行之羣衆竟科集持木棍竹竿之工人，分赴靑年會等處，將學生顧欽樑（東吳附中），何學澄（中法學院），俞進榮（中華職校），張鏞等四人，拖出毆辱，其中張鏞受傷最重，現在南洋醫院醫治。何家澄則係在家中散發「停止內亂」，「要求和平」傳單，被羣衆團入痛毆。昨日下午三時，本市學生反內亂大同盟會代表段昌智，吳寶生，陪同顧等四人，晋謁吳市長請願，適市長公出，乃由交際科張科長代見，顧等當提出要求：（一）澈查事件眞相，嚴懲兇手，（二）要求賠償全部損失。（按張鏽被毆時並失去自來水筆及現鈔），張科長面允轉達市長，並加以安慰。</p>

<h3>招商局舉行會議　商業務統盤計劃</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕國營招商局，勝利後還滬復航，接收敵僞船舶甚多，並由政府向美購進大批船隻，均交該局，故該局有龐大數量之船隻，但各航綫仍未能暢通，致遭各方指摘。最近業務處同人，見國府還都，行將完竣，長江遣送日俘亦將完畢，非但爲各航綫交通計，即爲該局營業計，亦應統盤籌劃，故特提出建議書，大致謂各航綫應在軍公運輸下，宜分配船隻以維交通，在業務上當大有發展，業務能發展，即可增加收入、局方經濟亦可寬裕。上項建議已得總經理之贊同，定明日（星期三）召集全局各處課主任專員等開會，對建議書之各節精密研討。</p>

<h3>中美農業技術合作　美方代表團　明日可抵滬</h3>
<p>預定在華五至六個月　周部長來滬準備歡迎</p>

<h3>浦江輸運貨物　偷竊甚於走私</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕據江海關秘書室劉秘書吿記者稱：關於外貨之走私間題，並不如外界所想像之嚴重，因走私之原因不外避稅與避禁例（如奢侈品係禁止進口者）二端。現美國貨進口者，價格大多便宜，根本無需避稅。而奢侈品之走漏進口者，爲數亦不多。又謂現在之走私品約分三種，一係由船上水手愉帶者，一係美軍用品，一係用飛機載運者。關於後者，二月前曾有菲列濱人所設之某公司利用飛機裝遝走私品而被查獲。故現在龍華，大塲，虹橋各飛機塲均有海關關員服務。劉氏又云目前最嚴重者係偷竊問題，外洋輪船進口因碼頭及倉庫不數應付，多暫泊港內，等候數星期數月不等，在此悠長時期中，貨物難免不被偷竊。劉氏以爲除海關盡其職責外，並望軍警當局，亦予協助云。</p>

<h3>談談救火會</h3>
<p>熱天裏的火災較冬天爲少，市民們暫時疏忽了消防處的重要，可是也許會每天看見街上有急馳而過的救護車，交通肇禍事件，現在每月在三四百次以上，運重傷病人至醫院，這件工作也是由消防處承當的。</p>
<p>上海的消防處、無論是在設備和人員上，有一個相當堅強的陣容。它把前租界時代直屬工部局與法公董局的二個消防處合併爲一，力量增大了，同時服務範圍也擴大至市區範圍之外的四郊，現在的消防處屬警察局管轄，處長周兆祥從前是在重慶服務的。</p>
<p>消防處的組織是這樣的：處以下分三課。第一課是預防課，所負担的工作主要是在調查執照，視察公共娛樂塲所及工廠學校等之消防設備，有不全者，隨時更正之，以免火災之發生。第二課是救護課，凡發生火災時之一切如救護，急救，通訊，事務等以及訓練員警等事都屬此課。第三課是機械課，消防處自備工塲，修理有損壞的救火車，現在有工塲二處，一在虹口，一在泰山區，泰山區之工塲，不久將遷移併入虹口去。除了三課之外，直屬處的還有一個消防總隊，下設九區隊，爲中央，虹口，楊樹浦，新閘，靜安，宜昌，泰山，吳興，新開河九區。此外並且有民辦的義勇消防隊，分佈滬南，閘北，滬西，浦東，虹　等諸區，它們皆與消防處</p>
<p>取得聯絡，使工作上取得便利。</p>
<p>全部大小車輛　一百五十二輛</p>
<p>據第二課李課長說：消防處全體員警目上到下共有八百二十三名，車輛共一百五十二輛，包括脚踏車在內，其中有輕型救火車六輛，中型幫浦車十七輛，大型幫浦車十六輛，雲梯六輛，此外並有救險車，照明車，蒸氣幫浦車，消防艇等。長　共分司機，消防，教護，通訊，瞭望五種，各司專職。李課長認爲消防繁是專門性的，他們須學習特殊技能，經過三月訓練後，並通過考試，始能升爲正式員警，招考時之條件最要聚的爲體格強壯，舉重能力强，消防員警每七天有一大休息，其餘時間，他們須常駐救火會內，以備不測；每天早晨有早操，中午也須集合點名。說到他們的待遇，李課長搖搖首說：「以他們的工作言，賞在太苦了」。李課畏認爲外界對消防警的誤解太深，「良莠是不能混爲一談的」</p>
<p>救火步驟</p>
<p>關於聞警救火的步驟是這樣的：總處設有控制室，外界來電報警，控制室立刻電鈴通知發生火災之該區隊，該區隊之通訊室得總處之直達電話，立時命令出發，一面仍向控制室報吿，火勢如有廣大者，由控制室再直接命令其他區隊去輔助，所以速率是很高的，接報後數分鐘內，救火車即可到達火災發生處。</p>
<p>最後李課長說：「街上的交通太擠，有時有妨礙救火車的來往。（山）</p>
<h3>籌組自來水供應綱　擴展輪渡客運計劃</h3>
<p>趙曾玨報吿改進公用用事業</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕市政府於昨晨九時，舉行國父紀念週，出席吳市長國楨，何秘書長德奎，各局局長，各處處長，曁市長以下職員三百餘人，　市長領導行禮如儀，公用局趙局長曾珏報吿本年一月至六月對於上海公用事業治標與治本及此後改進建設大上海計劃。對：（一）飲水問題，如計劃成立滬西唧水廠，並積極糾織全市各區自來水供應網。（二）供電問題，因本市發電負荷已達最高峯，現正謀開源，至今年底各電廠可增至十七萬基羅瓦特。（三）煤氣，本市僅有煤氣廠三所，不足應付，擬在南市增設一廠。（四）陸上交通，據統計公共交通車輛，較戰前減少，私人零星車輛則反見增加。現擬努力發展公共汽車事業，法商廿一路公共汽車已令設法恢復，郊外交通鼓勵商民投資作臨時經營。（五）水上交通，發展市輪渡計劃。擬在東昌路行駛可載渡車輛之輪隻。北京路外灘，開闢對江渡專作客運計劃，填沒張家浜，關作公路。其他關於電話碼頭倉庫等之改進，以及大小輪隻之停靠均有詳密之建議，至十時許始畢。</p>

<h3>國立海事學校　規定本年暑期招生標準儘先考收沿海省籍學生</h3>
<p>〔本報南京訊〕過去我國海洋工作人才，廖若晨星，以致海檯旁落，航業萎頓，不但海運事業全操外人之手，即內河航運，亦大部分為外輪所佔，學者推考清代致弱之由，有泰半由於「海病」之說，現不平等條約廢除，我國航業亟應恢復。教育部為亟謀培植此項人才力圖補救計，前特擬籌設海軍職業學校，校址勘定於武昌上新河，並經派劉開坤為該校校長。劉係黃浦軍校海軍科第一期畢業，繼在德國但澤工業大學造船科畢業，並留英担任航務工作多年，在國內亦歷任同濟大學教授，交通郃海軍郃及招商局等技術要職，前年並由軍事委負會任為赴英航運造船考察團副團長，專門著述頗多。劉任校長後，銳意規劃進行，將成立完備之國立海事學校，現除已有寬敞完美之校舍外，並有大小輪船十一艘，機帆船多艘，並正在籌設機械實習工廠。該校上年除已招收少數學生外，本年暑期招生，規定標準，擬儘先考收沿海省籍之學生，現即擬派員分赴沿海各要埠辦理招生事宜。又以一般社會對此尚少明瞭，故並飭於招生前，將該校性質及今後建國需要詳予闡釋，對於錄取學額，以考生程度體質品性志願而定，注重素質，而暫緩量的擴展。（愚）</p>

<h3>竺可楨校長演講　浙大的今天和明天</h3>
<p>— 朱任天</p>
<p>月米常常收到許多憧憬着想進浙江大學的已畢業或將畢業高中的同學和朋友的信，要我報導一些關於浙大的消息，當時我都假着「竺校長不日蒞杭，詳情容後再告」，婉言答覆了他們，今晨（十四）竺校長召集全校師生，假本部大禮堂，報告浙大情形甚詳，很可以作他們的一個參考，更何況他們之外還有更多憧憬着浙大的人們呢？因此不自　陋，從日記中，摘錄竺校長可楨先生演辭的一部，妄擬了這樣的一個題目，披露了出來——浙大的今天和明天：</p>
<p>浙大遵養總校師生凡二千餘人，除負重及畢業班同學外，隨校遷返杭州者約千五百餘人，大部同學已過漢口，安抵南京，除同學一人不幸失足墜岩遭遇不幸外，率數途次平安，指日可以經　來杭，唯以校舍不敷，建築需時，無論總校分校同學，均不得暑期留校。至於校員圖書儀器計約三百餘噸，合全體師生行李在千噸以上，以運輸程序而論，浙大被列為第三十七，但是學校開學有定期，許多儀器圖書，務必於規定時間內到達，因此不得不在重慶特別設立辦事處，策劃辦理汽車的運輸事宜，但是勝利後之今日，交通工其之困難，幾甚於戰時，由重慶運杭，每噸約需國幣百萬元以上，這困難的情形，不得不使我們有「復員難於逃難」之嘆！</p>
<p>至於校舍問題，遵義總校佔地四千方，故復員後之浙大，至少需六千方，始可解決全部師生工作場所與住宿。浙大校舍在戰前已不能算是十美十全，陷後重要房屋均遭破壞，所遺校舍雖無正確之繪測，大別佔之，不出二千五百方，尚差三千五百方，以目前物價計算約需三十五萬萬元，始可完成此三千五百方之校舍，但教部復員經費僅十五萬萬元，與理想相差甚遠。為顧慮事實的困難，只得暫定校舍四千方為進行計劃，新建千五百方擬即開始投標，期於十月底竣工，因此開學日期不得不延至十一月初。</p>
<p>由於校舍的限制，對於招生與添設醫學院以及法學院的增系，均須有所考慮。現上海南京等地，教部所辦之臨時大學的學生，合計凡五六千人．再靑年軍退伍青年，其學歷在高中畢業或修完第五學期者亦不下數千人，擬分發於東南各大學，自然浙大也不能例外，然而我們知道，大學教育，在養成實學致用的幹部，因此在校時須有半官的學程，勤學的風氣，和那嚴格的甄試，記得英國訪羣國對於浙大的批評，認為各方面都足與英國的各著名大學比美，這是可以自慰慰人的。個人並不否認臨大與從軍同學的程度，但是必須遵循入學考試或編級考試的浙大的一貫作風，這一點我也與教部當局談過，不過這是整個的問題，賢明的教育當局，該會有整個的辦法的。</p>
<p>誰都知道，浙大的校訓是「求是」，今天的紀念應就是往昔「求是書院」的遺趾。在其實，「求是」二字，不但是做人處世的圭臬，也是今世科學探究的最後標的。</p>
<p>是的，二十世紀是「人民世紀」，是民主時代，在這時代中，誰都有着信仰和言論的自由，不過我們要注意一點，所謂「民主」，因然以最大多數人之福利為最大前提，以最大多數的意見為總數的意見，然而同時我們要尊重小數人的意見，至少也該給予小數人的發言的儘量機會。英國的共產黨佔有的議席是極少數的，但是共產黨員仍然可以在「巴力門」高談闊論，大放　　，這才是真民主。蘇聯可不行，他們只有農工階級的發言權，而抹煞了其他的階級，這不能稱是真民主。所以我說：「英國式政治地位平等，經濟地位不平等；蘇聯是經濟地位平等，政治地位不平等。總之，他們正走着背馳的路。無論在杭州，在農義，同學們都喜歡貼貼佈告，表白自己的意志，對的，這是民主精神，但是既然是「表白自己的意志」，文書自然就該由「自己負起」，在佈告上必須具簽自己的名字，至少也該註明你住的地址，這樣，才是言論自由的其諦。</p>
<p>學校是「百年樹人」的所在他的使命在如何培植實學致用的人才，因此我反對學校中有任何黨派的政治活動，內地好幾隻大學，都是為這一點而撐不起脊柱，挺不起胸膛。民主時代的今天，我們並不反對信仰自由，但是我們否認學校為政黨左右角逐之地，在校時儘管你可以有你的思想和信仰，但是你不能強迫天下人都和你的思想和信仰一樣，而發生了什麼「左？右？」的角逐。</p>
<p>有人反對學生的志願，在「做大官」「賺大錢」，我個人就不作如此想，我覺得每人都得立志「做大官」，但是做大官必須做大事；每人都得立志「賺大錢」，但是要從振興水利，開採鑛產，發展交通等有關「國計民生」的事業着手。今天我們只知道政治的不上軌道，官官相護，官官貪污，其實這批貪官們，在十年二十年前也是像你們一樣，喊過救國的口號，寫過「打倒貪官污史」的標語，為什麼？這就是因為在校時沒有注意到小事，而這小事足以影響未來，譬如拿了公家燈泡作私用，折了玻窗墊案子，這都是小事，然而這是貪污的根苗，我們也可以檢舉他為貪污，因為燈泡玻璃都是公家的，國家的。</p>

<p>商業新聞</p>
<h3>金鈔交易均有限　港票較前收跌</h3>
<p>烚赤昨極平和，交易不多，人心穩定，晨開平盤，開後自一九二萬　陸續有零屋之買戶，勢漸向上，十時後中央配給一五〇條，　一九三萬，銀根鬆動，此後曾漲到一九四萬五，而後稍圓，午刻在一九三萬五光景掙扎，午後現交微降，隔日期交易仍易回上，結果較上週六升一萬二，飾金紋銀均平，暗拆自一角二分至一角半。</p>
<p>外幣美鈔疲後易穩，交易亦極有限，自晨開二六四〇元開後有套買維持，不久即微升至二六七〇元以上，午刻在二六六〇元左右徘徊，午後仍吿平定，結果與上週六相彷彿，港票轉疲，結果跌十五元，港滙自五三五元退落，羅比六五〇元起。回小少許，成交更少，英滙八千二至八千四，美滙明平暗寂。</p>
<h3>統丙只有軋帳</h3>
<p>小銀行吸收雜牌</p>
<p>公債並無正式交易，塲外喊價有若干未了結交易，互有對做，雜牌有小型銀行餘資吸收，較爲活躍，統丙全部軋帳，實物交易寂然無聞，喊價自七〇〇元扳高至八五〇元左右結束，結果較上週六微見秀穩，雜牌自三五〇元起五五〇元不等。</p>
<p>昨日紗市普遍上翔，雙馬紗奔騰在前，雜牌附驥在後，粗細各支無不高漲，尤以雙馬一跳十二萬爲最劇，緣華南來客對此牌獨加鍾愛，一哄而至一百五十六萬之新高峯，然與雙馬同等品級之</p>
<h3>雙馬一跳十二萬　雜牌粗細均跟進</h3>
<p>金雞大發俱有望塵莫及之感，傳由粵南買去而轉售南洋及遷港等地去路，專以雙馬爲對象也，廿支中小型及十六支紗交易未見十分踴躍，價亦跟上三四萬，四十二支雙股綫織廠進胃漸開，亦升七萬，午時紡建照例開紗，卅二支以上細紗價，較上期標高五萬至二十萬，惟一百支雙股綫昨日已無供售’而增開半支無牌筒紗一種，價標十五萬，惟每件僅重二百六十八磅。</p>
<h3>現棉交易尙佳</h3>
<p>昨日紐約美棉電訊報漲九至十二磅音，計延期二九·四八，遠期二九·五五，米特林現貨三〇·一〇，本埠現棉交易較佳，申新第一廠曾進特別米特林十一萬七千五百元，又第六廠進巴西花價九萬五千元，此外花號亙做交易爲多，價漲一二千元，</p>
<h3>布市又復回挺</h3>
<p>自公債黑市崩潰已來，有一部份游資已轉向紗布市塲拖進，同時實需如蜀，漢，粵，等地採辦又漸活動，尤以嗶嘰士林布銷路較暢，坯布北方納胃末閉，所以布市又復回挺。</p>
<h3>供求均甚活絡　人造絲續漲</h3>
<p>昨日一二〇號大橋人造絲，晨開盤喊一百八十萬元，最大八十四五萬元，最小喊過七十八萬元，卒做一百八十五萬元收盤，下午有人擬拉提，但有人儘量供給，故價反稍疲軟，做八十二萬元，比上週末高二萬元，一二〇號雜牌，均大二三萬元—一五〇號白富士有光，做四十四五萬元，七五金鷄半光，做大六十六七萬元，廠絲昨印度行家有交易，七十五分以上勻度，做價二百三十萬元，用戶絲價略疲弱，同行互做有三四十擔成交，價二百十萬元至十五萬元，另擔二百〇五萬至十萬元，干經無交易喊價較週末略小四五萬元，綢貨美亞被面比上週末又小二萬元，且乏成交，大誠格子璧縐，上午四千九百元，下午五千〇六十元，比上週末小一百五十元。</p>
<h3>米市塲　客貨銳减</h3>
<p>米號照市撥配　麪粉仍然未開</p>
<p>米市塲昨日客貨登記銳減，數僅及七百六十四包，內計羊秈二九五包，蕪秈一五八包，白元十包，碾秈二七〇包，糙米卅一包，各米號門市需米，仍照市撥配，故市勢無變動，各檔貨價亦原盤未更。麪粉未開，小麥北洋去化轉懈，價略回跌，油市平站之局，黃豆廣幫問津，高貨見升千元，中關加三五百元，苞米亦加千元，生仁黃蔴彷彿，蠶豆消化略佳，回漲千元，麩皮鄉銷動辦，價升二百元。</p>
<h3>新祁紅首批已到　成本浩大未易暢銷</h3>
<p>安徽祁門紅茶，今年首批新貨，已由本市震和茶棧裝運抵滬，惟在採製及一切繳用浩大下，成本相當可觀，每擔須達數十萬元，綜觀目前情形，脫手恐未能蟬聯，至於洋莊茶市亦因華茶成本過高，故對於出口方面，莫不大受打擊，但近日茶柔中人，爲謀展開外銷起見，雖國外來價奇緊，然自願虧蝕，仍有在趕製中，俟船期迫近，即擬報關出口，而各種內銷茶持者大都不忍輾脫，吐售趨减，但本街店戶及客帮等地鹽於刻下胃納尚飽，毋須急求，市勢疲憊。</p>
<h3>磚瓦暢銷　空心磚供不敷求</h3>
<p>磚瓦近日船少到貨不暢，市價均升，靑瓦片銷路最旺，因各處搭蓋平屋之故，售價比磚頭俏俐，大中磚瓦廠出品空心磚，本市銷數雖有限，但外埠南京一帶來滬購定頗夥，竟至供不應求。</p>
<h3>紫銅荒　美工廠關門　電氣業停頓</h3>
<p>〔路透社紐約廿四電〕現下美國紫銅之供應情形，至點嚴重，多數工廠因缺乏來源，業已被迫歇業，其中以電氣工業爲尤甚。生產商人對最近實施之新限價，至感困惑，蓋准予將限價提高之生產商，僅限於二月十四日與勞方成立新工資協議之各家，且協議須經政府批准者。時至今日，能將限價提高之合格廠商，僅安達可達一家，另小型生產商一家，亦可望合格。其餘各廠商則僅能按每磅十二分之舊限價出售，至新限價則爲每磅十四又八分之三分云</p>
<h3>美生活費漸高　比七年前漲三分一</h3>
<p>法國新聞社華盛頓廿三日電，勞工部頃發表報吿稱，美國生活費自一九三九年迄今，計已增加三分之一，仍在增漲之中，日常生活必需品之價格，在過去三十天內，增加百分之〇·五至一，以視第一次世界大戰後美國物價升漲一倍，尚屬差强人意。</p>
<h3>公司允許開售　食糖趨勢略平</h3>
<p>昨糖市以同業代表向台灣公司接治後，已得滿意答復，並允今日開售所有現貨，惟存底確已有限，故現貨價格將維持原盤，同時並可拋兌路貨，價在九萬五千元之譜，因此趨勢轉平，公會划盤上午中砂白初僅十萬〇六千元，後由八九千元升至十一萬元，下午仍回至八千元之譜，號貨開出刁靑廿二包，九萬五千元，小千元，次之九萬三千元，興化白數十簍，十萬〇六千元，降度近萬，聞油靑路貨有二千餘包，日內可到，如是則後市當可略平。</p>
<h3>白煤稍見活動</h3>
<p>煤市白煤塊前因到貨充斥，賣氣濃厚，市價頻落，而進戶反意呈觀望，恐市價再度下跌，近因市價跌落過鉅，不够辦本，是以到貨銳减，並多數急需用欵之散戶，均將斬訖，雖現時銷路仍爲淡月，但有一部份實力雄厚大戶，均乘低殺進，以備冬需，故交易已稍較前活動。又白煤小子因缺貨，行情頗爲堅秀，陽泉小子市價反超陽泉篩塊之上。</p>
<h3>金融改革　美顧問研究中</h3>
<p>新任行政院最高財政金融顧問泰馬那氏業於日前由美抵滬，在中行設立辦公處，開始研究各項財政金融問題，泰氏在美擔任聯合準備銀行重要職務，對於遠東金融問題，頗有研究，此後其研究之重心，將着重於改革各項金融設施，以作當局參考。</p>
<h3>恐慌心理逐漸泯除　華洋股市况轉秀</h3>
<p>華股局勢已定，人心恐慌稍爲泯除，買戶活躍，永紗自四九〇元步升至五三〇元，美亞自二八〇〇元步漲至三三八〇元，景福低價一九〇元，高價二三〇元，新光形勢最見秀色，自二〇〇元步升至二五三元，勤興低價一五〇元，高價一九三元，午刻高後略有回落，漸吿盤旋，結果較前收永紗微漲，美亞回升一成弱，景福漲半成，新光勤興各好一成，冷門中型信和好一成弱，中紡火柴平平，小型各股各好一成左右，外股漸露光明，業中股實大戶，有所吸收，大股除會德豐，小股除紙業亞洲外，均吿回好，熱門怡紗自九二〇〇元步升至九八〇〇元，英聯自八〇〇〇元升至八四〇〇元，餘者亦被帶上，結果較上週六計會德豐亞洲紙業均雖升而不多，英聯怡紗好起半成左右，餘者則漲一成至一成半不等。</p>
<h3>海味市况穏秀</h3>
<p>生粉上檔缺倘，下檔及茹粉仍萎，洋菜湘蓮平乏，禿參蝦尾海蜓到續銷暢，趨勢活絡，淡菜胡椒受港匯影響，自開緊後，勢頗穩秀，香菇粉絲來源稀少，故見續升，干貝榨菜前者存底奇薄，後者產地貨缺，步砌不已，其他亦漲多跌少。</p>
<h3>粵外滙開放後　結匯不得使用港幣　實行簡化結匯手續</h3>
<p>〔廣州廿二日航訊〕結購外滙指定銀行聯合管理會現經規定自本月十四日起，各指定銀行結滙，槪不得以港鈔付兌，至收受差額之國幣，亦應即行停止。又結滙買入由三九〇元，改爲四〇〇元，售出價照舊爲四一〇元，自本月十一日起實行。至於本市外滙掛牌後價格，出爲二〇二〇元，入爲一九八〇元。並實行簡化手續，此後出口貨商祗須將證明書填明，由貨主將外滙售與指定銀行便可交海關騐明放行，至申請購買外滙，則須填明購入貨物數量，經核定相符後，發給滙單。</p>
<h3>黑葉枝新貨已裝出</h3>
<p>廣東所產黑葉技首批新貨據號方息已裝出在途，大約日內可以抵申，總額聞爲一百數十担，各貨旣次第見新，則價格可望漸鬆。</p>
<h3>日本紡織貿易　印度將取而代之　擴展計劃積極進行</h3>
<p>〔路透社孟買廿四日電〕印政府按照戰後計劃委員會新近提出之擴展政策，特宣佈聲請特許證辦法，以便新紡織廠能於全印各地興建。查印政府與該委員會對各紡織廠之棉布增產，能達百分之五〇一節，均表贊同，果爾則印度棉布產量，每年可達七二億碼之多。惟紡織機器甚吿缺如，增產之目標　僅能達百分之三五，即一七億碼之數，且須另行添裝紡錠二·七五〇·〇〇〇錠，曼徹斯特導報頃對印度此項計劃爲文評論稱：若印度因此而不仰賴於進口之棉貨，且反能達全產量百分之十之出口平衡，則印度自能一躋而達日本在國際紡織貿易之地位，而與中國競爭其前途，自甚顯明。</p>
<h3>羅甸鈕出口難　亦係成本太高所致</h3>
<p>國產羅甸鈕，歐美人士均樂于採用，故在戰時亦佔出口品重要地位，惟戰後因批價逐漸高漲，外人皆改用代替品。據英商某洋行負責人談，戰前羅甸鈕每大羅批價僅八角美金，戰後已增加一倍，但出口者仍稀，原因係原料、工資，運費等影響成本太大所致。</p>
<p>製羅甸鈕原料蚌殼，此爲我國天然特產，經此次八年抗戰，歷年海蚌繁殖量定頗可觀，又據鈕扣業某若談，戰前歐美鈕扣市塲半數以上幾爲日本所獨佔，戰後日本已無鈕扣出口，倘當局注意此項出口，貸與資金，予該業以援助，俾减低成本，改良出品，實不難爭取歐美整個市塲。</p>
<h3>白桐油外銷不旺</h3>
<p>白桐汕雖有外銷去路，然因美國市價與吾國不相脗合，致出口難圖發展，聞紐約市塲現油每磅爲美金三角九分，而美政府亦以此爲購進之限價，若逾此購進，須受停業罰鍰之處分，故吾國去電有高於此者，　不置覆，但以此而核，則合到上海交貨每磅祗，三角五分可售，故從事斯業者，對於出口貿易味同鷄肋，近日雖有售開，合每市担祗七萬一二千元，交易不甚踴躍，且漢口市面反見好二三千元，外銷獲利更趨微薄矣，本埠出口去路當推植物油料廠爲最多數，蓋以國家資本經營國際貿易，當非普通商號所能望其項背也宜矣，內銷油售價約在六萬八九千元至七萬元之間，銷塲不勁，形勢穩定。</p>
<h3>魯鹽源源而來</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕太古公司湖北輪，由津南下兼　靑島，在靑運鹽五千包，烟葉大小一千三百餘件，前日抵滬，現泊浦西太古三碼頭卸貨。又招商局江平輪日前應差駛靑島，昨日返滬，裝來精鹽三百噸，係大業鹽公司之貨。</p>
<h3>北方經濟界鳥瞰</h3>
<p>平津生活費較滬低廉　關外缺衣着糧食尙充</p>
<p>中央銀行發行局長李駿耀，金融業務檢查處長李立俠由津飛返滬，據談：華北之金融工商各業，近因交通未能全部暢達，物資流通深感困難，然經當局多方之努力，關於交通與金融之流通日有改善，平津商品價格雖與滬相差無多，然一般生活費用，尙較滬市便宜二分之一，北平尤甚，津市爲北方之通商大埠，人口繁密，金融工商亦甚發達，但投機之風，遠不如滬市猖獗。現津市中央銀行已設外滙科。華北，之進出口商可就近在津　結，再由中央銀行集中上海辦理。</p>
<p>津市出口業向貝總裁建議予以扶助，貝氏已指示中央銀行與各指定銀行依照前頒鼓勵出口辦法，出口商可憑國外信用證向各指定銀有辦理週息五厘之低利貸款外，其餘各點，聞已擬成方案，俟商淸財政部及請示宋院長後，即可正式發表。</p>
<p>李氏曾赴瀋陽·長春·山海關等地，對各該地之金融工商業作實地考察，搜集材料甚多。據稱：東北在日本五十年來之經營下，金融與工礦農業，均有長足之進步，然因勝利以後，蘇軍佔領東北，　較　完備之工礦機器，多被蘇軍　拆運走，繼　中共軍隊破壞後，多數廠礦，殘殼僅存，沿鐵路綫之房屋，燒燬殆盡，景况甚爲悽凉。</p>
<p>當前東北最缺乏者，首爲棉織衣着物品，因日本在東北之紡織建設甚少，往昔棉織物，均來自日本，現日貨來源斷絕，僅靠國內之單帮客，少數運往接濟，幸東北農產富裕，糧食儲備亦充，糧食價格，食米與麵粉較戰前漲達七倍，雜糧僅漲三倍，至於工礦方面，雖經蘇軍之拆運及中共之破壞。然就鞍山鐵工廠而言，現所剩餘之機器工具設備，集中運用，猶為國內最具規模鐵工機器廠。東北流通貨幣，　中央認爲合法者，計為東北流通劵，蘇軍票，及滿洲銀行券三種，中共發行之抗幣。亦多散在民間，故該地之幣制甚爲複維。</p>
<h3>經濟簡報</h3>
<p>〔天津訊〕英商太古及怡和洋行，前因海運未暢，業務無多，該兩行經成立聯合辦事處，近以海外貿易。　漸活躍，已將聯合辦吉處解散，實行獨立經營</p>
<p>中委陳果夫發起組織大規模廣播公司，定名爲中國廣播公司，資金爲四百億，中央廣播電台將歸併該公司，爲官商合辦性質，一部招收商股，籌劃工作，正積極推進中。</p>
<p>外商保險公司，從未受我政府管制，國人頗受影響。勝利以後，財部爲穩定上海金融市塲，有外商保險公司加入保險業公會之規定，並限於三個月內辦理入會手續。頃悉：美商已正式申請入會，英商尚無表示。</p>

<h3>台灣第一港—基隆</h3>
<p>本報十四日航訊　特派員暮雲</p>
<p>展開中國的平面圖，台灣像是一條在藍色的海洋裏沉浮的魚，蹲在東南面向西北游，而基隆港像個魚口。內外的防波堤成爲地的牙關，貫通全臺島的火車線·公路綱·就是魚的神經系統，而飄在港外的彭佳嶼和花瓶嶼棉花嶼等，正是魚口所吐出來的泡沬。以地形來看基隆，已够說明楚的重要性，而與上海·東京·南洋·西貢·香港·厦門·各大商埠的聯繫，更說明在相互依存之外，基隆更成爲主要的呼吸孔道。</p>
<p>日本人看中了這個地理的優越性，化了四十年悠長的歲月，把她從荒煙瀰沒之地，建築成優良的港灣，並把她武裝成現代化的軍港，這種跡象，在基隆市的點與線，都可以看得出來。</p>
<p>本港吐納能力　戰前達　和點</p>
<p>佔有四·四平方公里的基隆市，東南西三面都給低山峰包圍着，北面則是渺渺一片的海洋。而可能利用的土地，只有一平方公里，在　個　　的土地上，構成商業區·政法區·別墅區·漁業區和交通區的中心地帶。在北方的海上，四十公尺以下用水泥構築的兩道防波堤，把海港淸晰地劃分着內外。外港沒有碼頭設備，內港則十分之八完全是人工構成的港埠。丙港有三部份：西港，二萬噸的船可以自由停靠，五千噸的船可靠十四艘，而與鐵道線相連接，碼頭上的起重機，自動的將貨物從艙裏卸到倉庫，旅客可以從二樓上走下來。東港。沒有人工碼頭，一千噸以下的船可以停靠。南港是人口稠密的漁港，爲着漁船的安全和調度，更有一條運河，便利水運。</p>
<p>以戰前發展的數字來看，每年上下旅客三十萬人，進出貨四百萬噸，就港的呑叱能力來看，她已達到了飽和點。</p>
<p>廿五次大轟炸　顯出凋敝深度</p>
<p>基隆市的全人口是一〇六·四七九人，經過盟機二十五次轟炸，人口銳减爲四〇·四五四人，八千幢房子被炸掉五〇五六幢，市街地區被害面積一·七一二五〇〇平方米，佔總面積的百分之五十六。一般的損失數字是：汽車66％，電話81％，電報100％，電線90％，病院66％，水管63％，漁船53％，肉產91％，海產69％，而被炸沉和破壞的船隻總數是四八四艘，約八萬噸。本市的生命線的貿易額，戰前輸出量（民國三十年）六五·三九七·八八一元，戰後（民國三十四年）九·八四三·六九四，銳减數字爲五五·八五四·一八七，輸入量戰前二七·四〇九·〇七四，戰後爲八·七三一·二一四，銳减爲一八，六七七·八六〇元。入港口的船隻戰前是一·九八三艘，八·三五七·六〇一噸，戰後則爲二艘，一二·七六九噸。出港的戰前一九八七艘，戰後則爲兩艘。</p>
<p>這些數字，幫助記者瞭解基隆，更使我們瞭解戰爭給日本和資源供應站的台灣之凋敝深度，因爲基隆的繁榮和衰落，正是整個台灣的反映。</p>
<p>廢墟上的建設　完成初步工作</p>
<p>基隆市的建設，直如在廢墟上重建一樣，目前市政府正將東京大地震後以復興公司承辦建築的計劃，同樣的搬用到基隆市來。基隆復興公司以台幣五千萬元作爲資金，其中百分之六十由省庫斥資，百分之四十由市政府斥資。以去年底的時價計算，復興總經費需七萬萬元。目前市府已完成了初步應急的工作，街道的淸掃，下水道的裝修等，大約在明年夏天，全部復舊的工程可以完成。</p>
<p>最重要的樂觀根據，是佔全島產量百分之六十的水產，祗要氷和燃料（香油）能供應無虞，可以增產一倍。機帆船的恢復，每年因爲滙兌和物價諸般關係，遭致了影響，可是這也祗是暫時的，一待航運恢復、基隆會自然地發展起來。</p>
<p>在五〇五六幢屋子裏，一千二百幢已吿修復，新造有二千八百幢，佔被炸房屋總數百分之七五。向救濟分會籌措了一百七十萬，修理二千七百公尺下水道的工程，已經開始。需費七百萬，為時九十個晴天，包工修復，一萬六千平方公尺的道路，有二座橋樑已獲有港務局的協助。本月中開始修理。</p>
<p>大基隆市計劃　地位益趨重要</p>
<p>作爲台灣第一港的第一任市長石延漢，他網羅了十三個日籍專家，擬定了以二十年後爲目標，工作五年爲基礎的大基隆市建設計劃。要是這個計劃能實行的話，二十年後的基隆，可以發展增加爲一倍以上。即旅客六十萬人，貨運八百萬噸，船隻爲五千四百艘。</p>
<p>在這個計劃裏，現有的基隆市，將完全成爲交通區，漁業區。政治文化，住宅區却須遷到近郊的八堵和瑞芳古，而以五分鐘一班的小火車作爲經常的交通主線。</p>
<p>石市長很興奮地吿訴記者，這一個理想建設計劃，將使基隆港的地位，更趨重要，要是外海輪船到台南，需要先過基隆，順沿着台東的外海繞過去，在時間的距離隆上，需要整整一天。</p>
<p>基隆，希望能飛快地建設起來，保持第一港的光榮，她也該像一條魚，只要有內外主觀客觀環境趨於好轉的話，總該有飛躍的一天吧。</p>

<h3>瓊崖風貌</h3>
<p>海口五日通訊　島客</p>
<p>記者在敵人投降之後不久，便到瓊州，居留時間已歷數月，對於瓊崖各方面情形，都很留意觀察，所得實際資料，倒也不少，現在特從各個度角去描繪一下瓊崖的近貌，相信必爲關心瓊崖者，尤其必爲旅外的瓊崖人士所樂賭。</p>
<p>瓊崖被敵人蹂躪了七年之久，眞是瘡痍滿目，百孔千創，正如一個殘弱的病者，急須妙方治療，廣東省政府主席瓊崖辦公處主任蔡勁軍將軍，他作爲地方最高行政長官，作爲這個病者的醫師，於本年二月中旬到任之後，即標示四大原則民安·便民·養民·新民·和二大急務——治安要緊，救濟要緊，同時發表長萬言的「敬吿瓊崖同胞書」輰論今後瓊崖應興應革事宜，並列舉九大目標，對於治瓊方策，標本兼顧。</p>
<p>在復員工作中，關於政治復員，固然先得造成政治的新氣象，以收拾人心，而完成地方自治，健全政治基層組織，尤爲急要之圖。自省主席瓊崖辦公處成立三個月以來，對於此項組訓民衆工作，加緊推行，辦理得最積極的，莫過於整編保甲，及實行聯保聯防制度，同時，更設盡辦法去加强地方自衛力量，使全島人民，在有組織有訓練的政治設施之下，由復員而動員起來，共赴自救救鄉與建鄉建國的偉業。</p>
<p>各縣的民意機構縣臨參會，一律早已成立。公務候選人，第一次檢　完畢，現仍繼續辦理中。鄉民大會與保民大會，這些最基層的民意機構，也正在加緊計劃，限期舉行。尤其此次省參議員之選舉，充分表現民生精神，不能不說是人民行使民權訓練的効騐。</p>
<h3>災情重　用人力克服</h3>
<p>現在，最費力的工作，還是救濟問題。瓊崖的災情，的確太嚴重了，據說在淪陷期間，瓊崖人口損失，達五十萬人。加之，大兵之後，繼以凶年，去秋　收，今夏奇旱，糧食恐慌，達於極點。政府現正設法以「人力」克制「天災」：一方面是籲請大量的救濟物資運來，行政院撥給救濟賞八千萬元，緊急農貸三千五百萬元，也已付到。另方面則將外籍難民遣送還鄉，計已繼續疏運遣去難工達一萬五千人，今尚有台胞萬餘人，需要補給，並在加緊設法船隻遣送返台。此外，如提倡節約，增種雜糧，及禁糧出口與禁酒等工作，無不雷厲風行</p>
<h3>文化荒　不亞於糧荒</h3>
<p>戰後瓊崖，文化荒不亞於糧荒。因爲敵人佔領期間，把一切文化機構都推毀凈盡了。我們加緊敎育復員的結果，迄現在爲止，計全島公私立中等學校，恢復者已達十分之九，中心小學恢復者已達十分之七，保國民學校恢復者，已達十分之五，各縣的民敎館，閱報室等，也都次第設立。現海口有報館二家，即民國日報與和平日報，雜誌有「和平半月刋」一種出版，另有「瓊崖建設」一種，在籌備中。最近又有「瓊崖文化協會」之籌設，瓊崖文化運動，漸逞蓬勃之象。</p>
<p>瓊崖淪陷多年，敎育落後，幹部人才甚缺乏，現在復員建設，需要大量基層幹部，至爲迫切。建設新瓊崖，先決的條件還是人的問題。蔡主任有見及此，特籌劃舉辦「瓊崖行政幹部訓練班」，該班第一期計分自治·戶籍·警政·佐治·合作等五組，學員共二百四十一人已於本月三日開學。依蔡主任計劃，該班訓練部門有二六種，要在很短期間，造成六千四百名以上的幹部人才，以應目前迫切的需要。</p>
<h3>交通綫　積極建設中</h3>
<p>據調查：在交通方面，自建設廳公路處瓊崖區辦事處成立之後，加緊搶修公路，現可通車路綫長約七〇〇公里，仍在趕修中，管理站計有海口東·海口西·文昌·嘉積南·嘉積北·萬寗·陵水·定安·金江·臨高·那大等十二站。現已登記領照行駛之公商車輛，約一五〇輛。在通訊方面：主席辦公處對於電訊電話之建設，至爲積極，計劃每縣設立一無綫電台，現在除九區區台外，已經成立有瓊山·定安·　縣·臨高·文昌·崖縣·瓊東·感恩·萬寗等九個分台。同時，對於電話，計劃架設環島幹綫，以海口·嘉積·榆林·北黎·那大等五處爲中心據點，而與各縣支綫連絡，以求通訊之暢達。</p>
<h3>拓荒者　為瓊島開發</h3>
<p>敵人在佔領期間，經營不少的工廠，並有各種工業設備，自我們接收之後，有的已被敵人事前破壞了，有的因爲接收管理不得法而散失了。此外又因爲人才問題和經濟問題，大部份工廠與工業設備，都沒法子繼續經營，這不但是我們的恥辱，而且是國家的莫大損失。關於這個工業復員的問題，記者曾往叩詢蔡主任，他說：所有工廠和工業設施，可以由民衆經營的，應該交民衆經營，以補政府力量所不逮，這個意見，經向有關方面提貢，務使工業早速復員，並進而振興之。瓊崖資源豐富，樣樣可以開拓，尤其對於國計民生最有關係的，如農田水利·漁業·鹽業·糖業等等，其利無窮，希望企業家們事躍投資經營。關於開發瓊崖，政府對於華僑這羣英勇的拓荒者，期望至切，瓊崖人富於創造精神，在國外經營工商業者甚多，他們旣有經營工商業的豐富經騐，又有相當雄厚的資本，所以很希望這些華僑，回鄉投資，共同爲建設新瓊崖而努力。</p>
<h3>合肥市景</h3>
<p>本報六月合肥訊　通訊員費超然</p>
<p>爆竹響，鬼子跑，省府遷肥，義民還鄉後，肥城在鐵蹄下的商民，已敢放膽大做，立煌市大腹賈的各業生意，亦追踪而至，遠遷大後方的商號，更挾貨而歸，各方巨流，同滙於此。因此，榛莽荒穢的古城，一變而爲車龍馬水，商賈雲集，雍雍熙熙的市塲。</p>
<p>商旅雲集　笙歌沸騰</p>
<p>此間因爲是全省黨政軍首腦所在地的關係，六十二縣各級機構，及縮編人員，絡繹不絕的，奔流於此，所以旅館，飯館，浴堂，新開的如雨後春笋，川流不息，常告客滿。規模宏大的酒館，如「太白酒家，」「中美餐廳，」浴堂如「中華，」「新生，」亦應運而生。且由立煌遷此，在李文忠公　開演的合肥大戲院，鑼鼓喧　，笙歌盈耳，尤可打破以往市面之沉寂。</p>
<p>市容待整　橋樑浮動</p>
<p>省府鑒於合肥街道狹隘，不合都市條件，原擬在城內，新闢「井」字式四條寬大馬路，但以一旦實行，對市房須大加拆除，刧後元氣大傷的民衆，不堪損失，所以遲暹不忍動工，只暫將前大街，四牌樓至大書院一段崎嶇石路，飭省府長伕隊，改修爲魚脊背式平坦康莊的馬路，幷將被敵炸毀了的鋼骨水泥的四牌樓原址，改建松樹綴成美術式的木塔一座，如達摩拱立，莊嚴雄壯。在南薰門外，宋代笑比河淸，鐵面無私，十里荷花，萬株楊柳的包孝肅公祠，年久失修，風雨剝蝕，省府及各界人士，已提倡重修，推定祠裔包政杰君綜理其事，且擬創建孝肅公園，一面培增市景，一面紀念先賢，經費暫定三千萬元，李主席已獨捐廉一千萬元，補助盛舉，其餘正在募集，鳩工庀材，不日動工，最近的將來，肥城可恢復戰前繁榮，或可過之。但橋樑動搖，令人生畏，除合肥至九龍崗一段，利用淮南路基尚好外，其餘均行車顛簸，如小兒搖籃，震人頭昏腦暈，且常有翻車，損害旅客安全情事，致有「坐汽車等於跑警報」之謠。</p>
<p>燈火漸明　市面淸淡</p>
<p>美中不足的是晚間，在兩月前，市面多點植物油燈，光線如豆，晚市幾等於零，近月煤油大批運至，商號已有半數改用汽燈，黑暗街市，一變光明。最近聯總所派的美籍電務工程司蔡士敦，惠然來此，允即負責向聯總撥運發動機，和器材，以助恢復之用，各界聞之均表欣慰。話又得說回來，合肥市面，雖漸繁榮，但除旅館，酒館，浴堂之外，其餘各業，均不大佳，即貴族式的太白酒家，中美餐廳，亦吿出頂。只有希望下半年五穀豐登，金九銀十之生意，彌補上半年之虧折。</p>
<p>房荒嚴重　米價上昇</p>
<p>同時，房荒仍形嚴重，周闆四十里的偌大城池，因市區破壞十分一二，住宅區破壞十分七八，人口驟增不已，求過於供。房主乃乘機居奇，將自居縮小，騰屋索重價租賃，近來市房每間每月租金達二三萬元，住房每間達三四千元，甚有預付租金一年者，公敎人員，不勝担負，刻正組織房金評價會，要求减輕，警局亦擬定房租規定辦法，已呈省府，一俟批准，即公佈實行。此間米價，在去秋每石只一千五百元，近因沿江米價高昂，商人紛來購運圖利，又陡漲至三四萬元，以致民不聊生，多有終日不得一飽，紛以未熟二麥春食。當局應禁米出口，此其時矣。</p>

<h3>防虎疫豈可分界限？</h3>
<p>編輯先生：最近滬市虎疫猖厥，人人自危，新任衛生局張局長到任之後，即以防疫爲中心工作，同時行總方面表示一致行動，也於本月十六日召開防疫會議，中央和地方的主管官以及衛生界的書宿，都被邀請出席，集中力量，全體動員，來撲滅本市虎疫。行總方面撥給衛生局DDT千餘磅，卡車數輛，防疫的器材藥品和經費都盡可能的協助。同時衛生局有借用行總卡車吉普車三十輛，參加防疫工作。如此上下一致，努力防疫工作，今後滬市五百萬市民，對於虎疫，當然用不着談虎色變，人人自危了吧。可是據明悉內幕的人說，在張局長未到任以前，行總方面也曾召集過一次防疫會議，不但沒有中央主管官和衛生界　宿被邀參加，就連當地的衛生機關主管人都沒有被通知出席。那時候的衛生局爲預防虎疫流行起見，曾一再請求行總發給防疫器材藥品，撥用卡車，除僅僅發給過一百多磅DDT而外，什麼都沒有撥給，卡車則要先繳款向行　購用。在防疫經費和防疫器材藥品極無辦法之下，前任工作人員，祗有埋頭苦幹，從事防疫。所幸託天之佑，沒有出什麼大亂子，也就因人事更動而過去了。像這樣的情形，我們做市民的眞有點莫名其妙。是不是我們市民的生命，都要以地方官與主管機關有關係，纔能獲得安全的保障呢？虎疫的流行，年年都有，都是以事前的積極預防，較事後的消極撲滅為重要。爲什麼在張局長未到任以前，衛生局的要求，行總方面就一無協助，連防疫會議都不通知主管地方衛生行政人員去參加呢？是不是因爲張局長是由行總調出來的，他的政績好壞，和行總有連帶關係，所以就這樣的特別行動起來呢。要知道一個主管部門對於地方機關應興應革的事，要以事爲對象，不要以人爲對象。人民的生命安全是重要的，這種行政上偏　私人的私見是萬惡的。當此虎疫猖獗，除了希望你們努力來補過自新，從事防疫而外，爲着今後市民的生命安全，請革除這種行政界偏護私人的惡習啊！讀者武揚眞上。大月十九日。</p>
<h3>譯員要求考留學</h3>
<p>編輯先生：報載靑年軍復員管理處爲獎勵退役靑年軍深造起見，選派若干已在專科以上畢業者出國留學，已商得敎部同意，由敎部擬就章程，將於七月廿一日與敎部公費留學考試一併舉行等訊，頗示政府對靑年獎勵之至意。我們連想起還有一批軍中的繙譯們，由卅一年飛虎來華起，至日本投降盟軍大量來　止，敎部和外事局先後向後方各大學徵調學生三千多名任軍中繙譯，出生入死，含苦茹辛。我們不敢說有功抗戰，但確曾略盡國民天責，交大楊大雄，聯大繆斌，復且鄭登熾，等等十七位譯友的陣亡殉開，便是個好榜樣。徵調之初，敎部和外事局曾有規定，「譯員退役後，擇成績優良者十分之一，公費留學。」　譯員遣散時，外事局還强調「公費留學人數增至十分之二或三，」當時還　有參加留學考試的證件。勝利後，譯員們紛紛自各戰塲歸來，先後於去歲八月十六日起至今年年初接受遣散。之後，曾一度報載五月中舉行譯員留學考試，此次敎部留學考試消息發布時，有「譯員及靑年軍留學問題將　舉辦」之說。現在靑年軍的公費留學間題解決了，而譯員們的留學問題，却不見提起。現在我們要求外事局會同敎育部，遵照所頒的法令，宣布選拔退役譯員十分之二或三，參加此次公費留學考試，或宣佈另訂辦法。我們將（一）呼籲社會，請各界促起外事局和敎部的注意；（二）請主辦徵調譯員的各大學敎授校長們向外事局及敎部詢問催促；（三）聯擊退役譯員，力事申請。事情的　　實行，權在政府，我們祇作一個請求，報吿政府在復員的過程中這兒還有一點小小的懸案。我們假定的聯絡站是：（一）南京第一民敎館董彭年，（二）重慶沙坪壩中大機械系張育英，小溫泉中政校周捷，（五）上海公用局施鴻熙，東吳大學楊傳　，正言報社曹法，（四）漢口行總湖北分署孟繁英，（五）北平社會局羅識高，（六）昆明　大陳永長。一羣退役的譯員楊寶　（復旦）·施鴻熙（交大）·楊傳齡（東吳）·張育英（中大）·周捷（中政）·孟繁英（聯大）·林敦華（浙大）·唐天熊（浙大）·劉述漢（重大）·張兆（復旦）·胡起麟（聯大）·何嗣章（中大）·萬本眞（復旦）·石景　（復旦）·朱法（復旦）·葛霖生（復旦）·林繼武（復旦）·陸慰慈（中大）·董彭年（復旦）等間肇。六月十八日。</p>

<h3>隨軍記者視野中的　臨城血痕</h3>
<p>— 鐘鏞</p>
<p>六月五日臨城通訊</p>
<p>此次第十九總部及九七軍，在臨城被共產軍主力十餘萬衆，包圍攻擊，從三十四年十一月廿四日起，截至現在爲止，將近半年，當戰事緊張時期，各方對於臨城之安危得失，無不關切垂注，蓋臨城之安危，實影響大局非輕，幸賴我臨城守軍，平時受黨的薰陶，陳總司令英明的領導，故環境無論如何困難，始終艱苦支持，而臨城民衆之同心協力，以及各方之慰勉鼓勵，卒使被圍三月之孤城，雄峙無恙。目前雖衝突停止，和平漸放曙光，但臨城守軍，仍被共軍重重包圍，艱苦局面，依然存在，而臨城守軍亦在不懈不怠之中，度其勤勞困苦之生活。記者隨軍工作，目睹民衆之痛哭失聲，將士之忠勇奮鬥，共軍之「非常手段」，不勝感慨，特將目睹實况，為我讀作一者簡略報導。</p>
<p>臨城的形勢</p>
<p>臨城為魯南門戶，是蘇北的屏藩，是臨棗綫的支點，是津浦綫的重鎭，棗莊大量的煤，是以臨城作轉運的樞紐，供給津浦隴海兩綫。同時臨城的水塔，是津浦綫上唯一的鐵路設備，在敵人的佔領期間，曾經三年長時期的建築，才完成這偉大的工程。現在韓莊，滕縣，兗州的水塔被共軍破壞之後，所存者僅此水塔而已。如果臨城不守，這僅存的水塔，被共軍破壞，將來縱然和平，鐵路允許修築，而此水塔，遭受破壞，則交通亦等於無用，所以臨城棄守，不僅隔絕了南北交通，而蘇北的徐州，也頓感威脅，同時津浦隴海兩綫，立即感到煤荒，鐵路交通恢復，亦屬無望。今日的臨城，無論在軍事上言之，無論在民生需要上言之，都不失它的重要性。</p>
<p>血染鳳凰山</p>
<p>鳳凰山位於臨城東北部二里許，我軍於進臨城後，即派廿九師八十六團第二營前往據守，以居高臨下之勢，策應興隆莊，四里石，及東托的我軍據點，十一月廿九日的夜間，陳毅率領新四軍第二師第四師，約二萬餘人的兵力，向鳳凰山突襲，我軍迫於自衛，予以還擊，激戰終夜，共軍傷亡四百餘人，第二日共軍又增加第五旅第九旅共約萬人，以密集炮火，進攻我山頂陣地，然我陣地守軍，均奮勇沉着，發揚高度戰鬥精神，擊傷共軍一萬二百餘人，屍橫山野。戰爭相持十二月一日，我軍以久戰大疲，衆寡懸殊，且以山頭工事被毀殆盡，於是這忠勇的一羣，終於與鳳凰山共同的壯烈犧牲了。</p>
<p>火燒興隆荘</p>
<p>凰鳳山的戰雲還未消散，興隆莊的烽火又接着燃燒了。十二月二日共軍於攻佔鳳凰山後，繼向興隆莊猛撲，們六八團一二兩營守軍，在康團長淸如指揮之下，迫不得已，起而抵抗。當時炮火之聲，震耳欲望，戰鬥繼續兩羣夜後，共軍傷亡兩千餘人，還未越過防綫一步，第三天却更加激烈了，共軍集中炮火轟擊案牆工事，並以密集隊形，掩護猛衛，當即短兵相接，實行白刃戰。這時興隆莊北部，已爲共軍佔領，我軍僅堅守南部，此時戰爭已成混亂狀態，房舍已在炮火中燃燒起來，火光冲天，烟霧彌漫，戰爭相持到第四天，我南部守軍，開始反攻，反復衝殺，喊殺震野，終將佔據北部的共軍，完全消滅，如是興隆莊危而後安，是役共軍犧牲七千餘，被俘八百餘名，我亦傷亡四百餘。</p>
<p>激戰林山頭</p>
<p>林山頭在臨城的東南方約二里許，山頭的西南脚爲薛莊，同爲我廿九師八五團第三營駐地，據守以來，曾遭共軍數度夜襲，幸我守軍防範嚴密，敵未得逞，十二月九日，共軍進攻興隆莊旣經失敗，慘遭重大頓挫，此次調集第二師，和第九旅，轉向林山頭突襲，同時又以一部，向臨城佯攻，共軍以第二師進攻薛莊，以第九旅進攻林山頭，薛莊首先被共軍砲火轟擊，嗣以衆　懸殊，拂曉時被衝入陣地，遂展開巷戰，白刃衝殺，激戰徹夜。我守軍一部，壯烈犧牲，一部撤至臨山頭陣地，林山頭在九旅猛攻之下，激戰甚久，仍堅持不退，並擊傷共軍一千四百餘名，這時共軍，復增援三千餘人，將林山頭緊緊包圍，相持到次日夜間，始奉命自動撤退，是役共軍共傷亡四千餘名。</p>
<p>戰士與戰馬</p>
<p>因爲臨城被包圍的時間太久了，軍隊沒有飯吃，經常餓着肚子，逃難的民衆，又何嘗不是一樣，民衆是難民，軍隊又何嘗不是沒有飯吃的難軍。惻隱之心，人皆有之，他們爲同情心驅使，在極度困難的境環當中，自動地每人每日節省糧食五錢，救濟被難的同胞，這個數量雖小，然而這種難能可貴的同情心，却使一般難民感激流涕。</p>
<p>在長時期的戰鬥當中，糧食無法運輸，士兵感覺營養不足，騾馬更感覺草料不够，於是我們的戰士。和戰馬，經常在餓着肚子。我在臨城市街所看到了官兵，他們在久餓之下，大多變了形態，頭髮深了，　子長了，眼球凹下去了，一種辛勞而又營養不足的瘦削狀態，充分的表現出來。但是他們的精神，還是一樣的充滿興旺感，騾馬的形態，記者無法去分析形客。槪括一句，所有的馬匹，都變成了骨頭架子，而且倒斃了不少。</p>
<p>難得菜根香</p>
<p>孔子在陳絕糧，三月不知肉味，後人很同情他，在頤城的守軍，不僅三月不知肉味，並且三月不知菜味了。人多菜少，供不　求，買一點菜，比買山珍海味不知還要難到多少倍。只要發現了一點菜，不論價值如何，能買到手的，就算幸遇。少數商人，無形中把菜價提高，據他們說是因爲他們是　最大的危險，在所謂「解放區」偷運來的，臨城的車民，的確有難得菜根香之感。因爲沒有樹子，飛島已失掉了他們應有的一枝之棲。</p>

<h3>憂之餘</h3>
<p>— 少夫</p>
<p>舉世滔滔，金條美鈔，當前社會的風氣，正走向無宗教，無信仰，全部精伸生活破產的地步，眞是危險極了！</p>
<p>雖然如此，在林林總總墮入渾渾噩噩之中，好人畢竟是有的，安貧樂道，謹守本分，待人以愛以誠，他們恪遵着道德信條，卻並不以此作眩耀，這類人數目雖少，不由不令人肅然起敬。</p>
<p>我知道有一位醫生，他在診所牆壁上掛着如下的一副對聯：「但求人皆健　不計已常貧」（大意如此）</p>
<p>他的確身體力行了這副對聯上所說的，他對待病人不僅悉心診治，甚至少幾個錢也無妨，這與時下的敞竹槓要花槍的江湖郎中比較下來，不啻上天下地。</p>
<p>我又知值一位局長，他的懷中記事簿第一頁寫着：</p>
<p>一·負責而不居功，二·尊重別人的意見，三·肯吃虧。</p>
<p>他早到遲退，住公家宿舍，決不作無聊酬應，從不亂花公家一文錢，勤勤懇懇，部下無一人不敬愛他，每月靠固定的薪水來維持他一家四口的窮日子。</p>
<p>寫到這裏，晚報上又看到這麼一則消息：</p>
<p>〔瀋錫廿四日電〕自敵人投降後，其遺留東北各地龐大物資，除大部由蘇聯軍運走，或經共軍搶掠外，其殘留民間者為數亦不少。然皆私自變賣，諉稱損失。今有永和製罐廠主人施凌雲，將日本飛機製造廠（滿飛）存儲彼處價值千萬元之空軍貴重器材，自動獻出，交空軍第十三地區司令部，此項物資，如以廢鐵賣之，亦值數百萬元之鉅。</p>
<p>這些，恐怕不會時暗夜中的點點星星罷：我們對目前社會風氣　然憂之之餘，還能滿懷希望者在此耳。</p>
<h3>蝶蛾展覽</h3>
<p>— 偉</p>
<p>最近成都，有一個以倡導自然科學為目的的「蝶蛾展覽」。</p>
<p>展出的主人是武大電機系學生凌霄君，展覽的地點是在春熙路靑年會的二樓。當您走上展覽會場，你可以看到各式各樣的蝶蛾標本，有些是你從來沒有看見過的珍品。據說這些展品最大部分是凌君近年來在嘉定·峨眉和陝西各地捕捉而來的。其中有嬌小玲瓏的虎斑蝶，燦爛瑰麗的食糞蝶，透明如玉的飄葉蝶，和年產七代的白菜蝶。他將各種蝶蛾分成百餘種標本。每組由四隻蝶蛾組成，雌雄各二，分正反面，很有規律地排列在裝璜素雅的鏡框裏。　翅完整，栩栩如生，使觀者看了莫不讃美稱好。那種細心耐煩的精神實在令人敬佩。</p>
<p>其中名貴標本有三：一種經常凄息柳葉之上，蝶翼本為黃褐色，但稍一側視，則變成艷麗的紫羅蘭色。次為枯葉蝶，雙翼極似枯萎的秋葉，常休憩在枝頭，因其形如枯葉，極難發現。其三為一對正在交尾的蝶侶：且被捉　，以至製成，一直保持原狀。凌君自稱為其平生傑作，蓋蝶類交尾時間短暫，且一觸即開，此為凌君集蝶史僅有的收獲。</p>
<p>此外弟二陳列室示集蝶的方法：包括凌君集蝶史的標本，以及捕捉，飼養，收藏，裝置等各種過程的據本，并有英國李屈氏Leech所著「中日韓蝶類分布表」懸置壁間。其中展覽興味者為蝶類生活史的活標本，自卵至成蟲，中間歷經的各個過程，分置四處。一目了然。據凌氏談，捕蝶必須在晴朗的天氣中進行，同時須穿着灰綠色的衣帽，捕網亦須灰綠色，以免把他們驚飛。裝製的方法。必須先設法去除其　腑，然後焙乾，壓平，再嵌人預製的紙板中。紙板後薄薄墊置有防腐劑的棉花，最後納入鏡框。全部工作，必須迅速進行，因時間過久則蝶翼脆化，不易處理。</p>
<p>第三室為美術部，係將蝶類蝶翼嵌入均有背景的畫片上。畫面與寓意均極別緻新穎，刻繪細膩，氣氛自然。其中一幅題名「朝鳳」，年前曾展出於嘉定武大，圖中寓意為「鳳」之蝶，曾以一〇四三票應選為「蝶后」。其雙翼似孔雀毛色，全碧輝煌，頗為悅目。</p>
<h3>嘴</h3>
<p>— 衣谷</p>
<p>記得某兄說過，女人最美的是二片櫻唇，換句話說便是美在嘴上；那雖不是至理名言，但卻也切實得很，至少有二個字可以形容，或者說被包括，那便是甜（抽象的）與熱（也許是真實的）。僅僅這二個字也是足以夠得上美的條件了，更何況還有那鮮豔的緋紅的顏色，配載白皙的蛋臉上，誰會否認不是具有絕大的誘惑力呢。</p>
<p>但是世上的事，往往利弊相佐，在另一方面，女人的嘴巴也許是最會說話，最喜歡說話，並且大多時批評別人的話。而這些評語中又是含有妬忌，猜疑，甚至輕蔑的；於是許多不必要的爭執與糾紛，便無形中種了跟，因為女人又是最不能保守秘密的啊！這些糾紛可能害及一身，一家，甚至整個社會國家，這豈不太可怕了！</p>
<p>其實；不但女人的嘴如此，即使男子也不能例外，由於堅強的自尊心。每人總愛稱讚自己，為自己辯護自己的缺點。若是那人能對對方退步，不爭辯，那末那人不是有求於他，便是關於威力之下。不然，他便是個精神病者，或是白痴。至少也是個愚人</p>
<p>說自己好</p>
<p>說自己好既是常人的通病，那麼由人結成的團體，社會，黨派，以至國家，當然也不會例外了。於是這自讀自好，自說自有理的結果便很危險了。</p>
<p>至於靠嘴賺錢，靠嘴吃飯的更比比皆是，不乏其人在。最切實的是電台上的廣播員，麥格風前的歌女，舞台上的演員。書場上的說書者，更有石路上的衣莊店職員，而其實教員商人又何嘗不是靠嘴吃飯呢？假使百貨公司或者其他櫃台職員，教員都不許開口的話，那麼這情形之糟，是可想而知的。</p>
<p>在美國的幽默大家林語堂博士曾說「在美國做總統，全是靠說謊而掙得這白宮寶座的，羅斯福說謊本領最大：所以連任了四屆總統。」那麼若是不因腦充血而　他的話也許有再來一次的希望，這　上去去似乎太笑話了，但在美國的競選中，廣播演說對中選與否確是大有關係的。</p>
<p>嘴在吃的方面雖不及講的方面廣泛，但卻也大有研究之價值。在目下　荒嚴重的今日，中國卻依然是「富人一席酒，窮人半　糧」。而在旱災兵變雙重劫奪之下的地方，更覺「朱門酒肉臭，路有餓死骨」之不虛了。試看廣州，因飢餓而致死者大有人在，但舞塲卻天天客滿生意興隆。</p>
<p>「禍從口出，病從口入」，的確是句至理名言，往往身敗名裂者，是為了嘴的關係，而其中以吸食麻醉品與飲酒誤事者為最。其實上帝造人時，只在人的臉上生了一張嘴，原是要人說好的話，吃足以養活身體的食物，而人類卻因嘴而造成了各種罪惡與意外，這也許是與造物者的本意背道而馳了吧？</p>

<h3>倘若美國遭了原子彈</h3>
<p>— 立川譯</p>
<p>關於原子彈威力的傳說很多，我們在報紙上先聽到了各種神奇的傳說，後來又見到所謂「不如傳說之甚」的消息。有一位名叫薛佛爾斯基的少校（Major　de　Seversky），曾也去廣島長崎走了一趟，他寫了一篇文章「原子彈神經病」（Atomic　Bomb　Hysteria）載在本年二月份的美國讀者文摘上，他也許就是這「闢謠」消息的來源，他把原子彈的威力說得很不利害，不過他的研究和觀察是很膚淺的，而他的結論在他的文章裏說得很肯定。因此引起了一羣專家們猛烈底反對，他們在廣島和長崎會費去相當長時光去研究和計算，所得結果絕對和這位薛少校的「闢謠」不同。這篇文章載在本年五月份美國讀者文摘上，可以算為他們對原子彈威力的總答覆，特譯出以供讀者們的參考。　譯者注</p>
<p>假如用一個我們炸過日本的原子彈來轟炸紐約城，將會發生什麽現象呢？特別是在那帝國大廈（註一）上？</p>
<p>我把這個問題去問法列爾少將，他是主持原子彈設計的葛魯夫斯少將的副司令官，並且曾奉命派往廣島和長崎去視察災後的毀壞情形。</p>
<p>「假使彈落得很準的話，」法列爾將軍說，「一個那樣的原子彈可以把帝國大廈夷成平地。或許有幾層殘餘的斷坦殘壁保留在地面上，但那是一個不堪佳人的了。再有一種可能的情形，就是人所希望的，那顆原子彈正好落在房子的外面，這種情形可能把這大廈的上部建築整個推倒。」就是普通最大的炸彈爆炸力已遠不能跟它比。</p>
<p>空中爆炸地面爆炸</p>
<p>不少專家，科學家，醫學家，和軍事學家，把廣島及長崎的災況測量過。他們中間有「美國戰略轟炸測量」（註二）的一百十四個專家在內，他們在那裏探詢着，測量着，並且拍了許多照片，經過了兩個月的時光。他們煞費苦心研究的結果，可以判斷得很準確，這樣一顆原子彈對世界其他地方的城市，可能發生的影響。這些專家們一致地，都很激烈地跟薛佛爾斯基少校的推測發生爭辯，薛佛爾斯基少校的推測量銳假若紐約或支加哥遭了那樣的一顆原子彈，所形成的災難和殺傷的生命，會跟一顆十噸巨型炸彈所造成結果一樣而已。</p>
<p>並且他們相信薛佛爾斯基寫的那篇文章危險地說低了原子彈的恐怖性，到了緊要關頭的時候，會把人們引人錯誤的安全觀念的。</p>
<p>在廣島和長崎轟炸時的炸彈，故意讓它在很高地空氣層中爆的，為的是使因爆炸而發生的炸力破壞波浪的面積，擴張到最壓大的面積。爆炸中心或許在二千礬一哩遠的幾層樓底磚砌房屋都全部轟平；一層樓的磚房則可以「英里半。在長崎，四千英及以內的工廠煙囪都會移動了，裂開了，或者傾倒了。有些四英里半遠的營房都會傾坍了得。在七英里遠的玻璃碎了百分之十。十二英里遠的玻璃也有破碎的。</p>
<p>當我們矚目一望美國城市的那些巍峨建築物的遠眺，很容易相信比起脆弱的日本城市來，要不容易破壞得多。這是很容易忘記的，甚至我們那些天城市裏的建築物，包含着十分之九以上是用粗磚，石頭或木料搭成的房屋，那些並不比廣島，長崎炸毀了的建築物強多少。</p>
<p>三平方英里之焦土</p>
<p>法列爾將軍現在回到他從前崗位上，做紐約省公共事業工程處的總工程師，為了他光明底前途，已經是一位建設人員了。當我請問他關於紐約將會受到的影響情形講得詳細的時候，他回答說：「假使單獨一個原子彈在一座典型底美國城市，在適當高度底上空爆炸時，我相信單式那猛烈底轟炸半徑可以到一英里或一英里以外。」這個就是說，超過三平方英里底面積內的房屋要毀滅，或者摧毀到不能讓那玩意殘留着底蒼生去居住的程度了。</p>
<p>但是不曉得我們那些偉大底寫字間大樓能否抵抗得住那猛烈的轟炸嗎？我同着莫利生博士，（他是一位物理學家，曾參與新墨西哥，羅斯，阿拉莫斯地方原子彈考騐得配合工作者，）坐在紐約市中心區的一條街道傍的籐椅子上向外眺望着。「美國的摩天大廈，」他說，「看起來比它實際要堅固些。它們是以層一層用磚塊或石塊砌起來的牆壁，每層的牆壁都安放在鋼架上。假使長崎型的原子彈落在附近的空中，這些建築物的牆面都會像樹上落葉一般地震落下米，把裏面的人殺死或傷害，碎磚片會把街道　塞住。假使落下到近地面地方，那些磚和石塊會像砲子一樣地射開。」</p>
<p>葛魯夫斯將軍在參議員麥克蒙氏所召集的原子能特別委員會中被質問關於華盛頓會受到原子彈有什麼影響時。他回答說，「假使彈正好落在五遲形的區域中心處，那這個五邊形將要整個被消滅。」這個葛魯夫斯將軍一定得知道的，因為五邊形區城的建造是他住持的。「要是以可能為敵人目標物的襲擊時，」他接着說，」那就得落在合眾國的三角形區和政府的那些機關上了，毀壞面積可能有兩英里的直徑。」換句話晚，形成的破壞和殺害的生命將足夠使聯邦政府高掛着，「急待修茸，暫時關張，」的照牌了！</p>
<p>世界未日過甚其辭</p>
<p>薛彿爾斯基少校在他那篇文章裏不承認軍事科學上已經起了一種革命，並且斷然地說那投在廣島和長崎的原子彈的影響是「過甚其辭。」他是被那種矛盾情形，就是他看到的和那「神經式的」非正式宣傳，所震驚而使他有這種想法。並沒有所謂物質在「轉瞬間蒸發」成「光點」的事實。轟炸並沒有什麼「特別」，因為混凝土的建築物仍舊有它「建築性底堅固；災害和死亡完全是因為「火災，不過是火災」——因為火的蔓延，並未始炸彈直接灼熱而生的火災。</p>
<p>對於最後那句怨言專家們的回答是，「這是為什麼？火用不着有什麼新奇，只要它做了它的工作。炸彈在投擲之前早根據目標和日本建築物的詳細研究而作精確底計算過的。薛佛爾斯基少校所找到的這樣失望底結論，這正式很準確地達到了理想的目的。在廣島用的炸彈是讓他在相當一種高度爆炸的，為的是要炸平最多數量的日本式木房子，那些房子就這樣地着火了。要是炸彈在接近地面爆炸，像蒸發的那種奇怪情形可以已經發生的，更多的混凝土建築物可以已經被夷平，一個小面積可以已經被炸彈直接灼變成桔焦了。但這樣是一種無意義底浪費。我們不是需要在日本的量色上添上些「光點」或者其他鏟平的實效。我們需要去結束一個戰爭。我們是做到了。用了兩個炸禪。假使那些不能使薛佛爾斯基動於衷的話，那他這人是屬於不到世界末日不怨恨的一類人了。」</p>
<p>專家們郡覺得薛彿爾斯基少校對那使一個帝國投降底毀壞力量觀察得太疏忽了！他們很明顯地指出他一定沒有看見一座學校的長形混凝土建築物，距離零點二千地百英尺遠，上面二層的一半都在這轟炸中破裂了的。還有另外一棟建築物，混凝土牆垣的傾倒的對角齒牙形裂縫表示着者整個建築物受到多麼大德一個推力呀。他沒有提到在廣島靠近轟炸處的那二十一座混凝土建築物，其中四座完全毀壞，其中十座則受到建築性地破壞。他的觀察點忽略了那些很多的日本建築物是要比造在美國的同類的建築物要堅固的多，為的是要抵抗地震的緣故。他看到旗桿，風信稈及其地脆弱性底東西的未遭轟炸的摧毀或烧着，但他沒曾雖見有二十根旗稈彎折了的，或者一座距零點六千五百尺的油庫上面的油漆被炸揮閃光的熱力燒得發亮，或者在距零點七千英尺遠小山上燒焦了的植物。</p>
<p>二萬噸炸藥的威力</p>
<p>薛佛爾斯基少校的意見說那樣的炸彈落在美國的城市中「會跟一顆十噸巨型炸彈所造成的災難一樣而已，」專家們對這點覺得最奇怪。這樣一顆炸彈包含不過五噸重的TNT，而原子彈爆炸的威力不下於二萬噸的TNT。</p>
<p>我曾看過那張載二千四百英尺距離的笨重樣子的廣島學校校舍照片，上面二層已經摧毀了得，並曾問法列爾將軍一個巨型炸彈對紐約所能生德影響。</p>
<p>「一個巨型炸彈，」他說，「照它的名字就能解說，祗能炸一個Block（註三）。女士四英畝。我們隨便假定一顆十噸炸彈要是落在四個Block的中心，那裏又全是低建築物，轟炸了，或說是猛烈破壞了十六英畝，那步過時一平方英里的四十分之一而已。要是一顆原子彈在同一情形地點，落在地面上爆炸時—保守點說—至少比巨型炸彈轟炸面積大八十倍；假若說在相當的高度爆炸，至少要大一百二十倍。」</p>
<p>莫利生博士想那原子彈的威力大過巨型炸彈至少一百倍，也許三百倍或者一千倍。一位美國戰略轟炸測量（USBSS）的土木工程師估計原子彈的威力就是在脆弱的廣島上，也不過一百倍到二百倍。美國戰略轟炸測量的副主席尼茲，對薛佛爾斯基少校的言論說是　完全超出理性範圍以外」。</p>
<p>對比着，美國戰略轟炸測量的一百十四位專家們在廣島和長崎費去幾千人小時（Man-hour）的研究和計算，薛彿爾斯基少校承認他是沒有做過什麼計算的，並且在每一個城中祇有兩天的勾留，「自然沒有足夠的時候，」像他在參議院的委員會上告訴人說的，做「一個許細酌研究。」</p>
<p>薛佛爾斯基少校的大著，逼得我們下決心「不過甚其辭地去證明這些事實。」專家們對薛佛爾斯基少校的答覆是這樣的，那是他自己的差誤把事實弄得顛倒是非的，那個對原不彈不確實的報告是特別的危險的。因為，照他那樣說法，一顆炸廣島型的原子彈炸起美國的城市來，並不比一顆普通大炸彈利害多少的話，我們大可不必作杞人憂天的想了，而自尋那掩耳盜鈴式的愚蠢快樂吧！同時對這可怕地武器的將被世界性德管制一事，也打可從緩辦理了吧！</p>
<p>「活着的人們，已經曉得怎樣去造一顆炸彈，它的破壞性相當於一百萬個十噸重的巨型炸彈。這樣一個炸彈要是落在華盛頓或其他主要城市時，可以想像得到的慘烈地破壞邢些建築物，並且要擊滅全城的人口。」康東博士說的，（Dr．Edward　U.Condon）他是炸彈設計的諮詢者及國家標準設計局的主席。</p>

<h3>再醮問題</h3>
<p>— 巴玲</p>
<p>「女子死了丈夫，是不是應該再醮？」在目前的中國社會情形之下，似乎還是一個值得研討的問題。</p>
<p>我們知道：在咱們國的社會上，一部份甚而至於大部份的封建思想，至今還是深深地印在一般人的腦海中，——尤其是農村民衆的腦海中。他們還是抱着「男子至上」主義，以爲男子死了女人，當然可以再娶，有錢的還大宴賓客，吹吹打打的續娶一個女人，旁觀者非但不予絲毫的非議，而且還表示着羨慕的態度。反之，假如女人死了丈夫而再醮，不但得不到一般親戚鄰居們的同情，而且還要在背後或是當面，加上許多的冷言冷語，來諷議着呢。這種情形，我們站在男女平等的立塲上說，認爲這是社會對於婦女的冷酷和歧視，確乎有加以糾正的必要。</p>
<p>我認爲：「男女平等」是天經地義，無可異議的。男子可以續娶，女子亦何嘗不可以再醮？—當然，自願爲丈夫守節的，不在此例。在某種情形之下，女子再醮，不但不應該非議，簡直還應該提倡。如第一次世界大戰結東後，參戰國婦女，大都因爲丈夫戰死沙塲，而實行再醮，眞是一種普遍的情形。所以婦女再醮，不但在人道上，在國家人口上，確乎是不應該予以反對的一件事。</p>
<p>總之，筆者並不提倡婦女再醮，但對於再醮的婦女，絕對予以同情，決不要予以輕視和非議的。</p>
<h3>美國的母親和孩子</h3>
<p>— 楊永彰</p>
<p>有人寫信給美國某醫學雜誌的編輯先生請求他答覆二個頗有興味的問題。</p>
<p>第一，那人問，如果有婦人二名，甲女年齡較大，乙女則較輕，他們若是母親的話，那麼，二人所生的嬰孩，究竟誰的孩子長得高，長得重；第二，這位神經過敏的美國人又問，美國現在所新生的嬰孩和以前的嬰孩，究竟誰的身量比較高，因爲他怕美國人會漸漸地您下去。</p>
<p>關於第一個問題的答案，並不是容易的，因爲這方面的研究和報吿，委實太少了。Waner氏根據班究的結果，認爲影響孩子生長的因素，除了經產及產後的種種情形外，母親的年齡也多少有些關係，普通太年輕和過大的母親，其所生孩子的健康都不免有些缺點，但比較起來，還是年輕者較良。因爲一般年齡較大的女子，可能已經是好幾個孩子的母親了，家庭的負担，當然加重，多生一個孩子無異多一份支出，年齡較大時產出的嬰孩，當然經濟條件遠不及頭生的（年輕時生的）來得好，無論在營養方面，保健方面，都有損於孩子的生長。其實，孩子的健康和家庭的經濟關係密切，和母親的年齡，比較的尚有限。</p>
<p>至於現在的美國孩子是否比從前矮，這是很容易解決的，根據醫學的調查和統計，美國嬰孩的身量非但不减，而且還繼續地增高呢。同時他們更相信下一代的孩子，其體重也能繼續增加。</p>
<p>想到小國的母親和孩了，眞是太可憐了，誰也不會注意到這種小（？）問題，當然也無從答起，中國做母親的婦女們，不知你們有什麼感想？</p>
<h3>兒童的心理衛生</h3>
<p>— 念仁</p>
<p>太太們：妳們常爲孩子的事由而煩惱嗎？或甚至因故發脾氣，駡打自己的孩子嗎？快請不要這樣，父母親的一舉一動是極易傳染給兒女的，「明日的孩子就是今日的自己」這句話不是故作驚人，常然，你絕對不願意看見孩了們有如些不明事理的行爲。細微的過失常是終身的遺恨。現在寫幾種兒童的普通失常行爲在左，請觀察自己孩子有沒有與此相同的。</p>
<p>膽怯，口吃，說謊，逃學，畏羞，頑强，胡鬧，好鬥，虛驕，幻想，怪癖，怕生人，懼黑暗，發脾氣，依賴成人，或憂鬱寡歡。</p>
<p>若犯有其中三項或四項，那令郞（令婑）已是精神不很健全的孩子了。</p>
<p>雖然不必過分憂慮這些是失治的病症，但亦不應該等閒視之，且無意中使他增長蔓延，產生嚴重的「歇斯的里」與人格分裂症。這些病者常爲一點刺激緊張而失明及某部麻痺。鄰居中有好鬧喜爭的婦人嗎？她往往容易引起肝火向丈夫發脾氣嗎？這就是因爲她不注意心理衛生，自幼就漸養成這種惹厭的行爲。因了精神上的細故，對於日後事業社交上有很大的影響，譬如孩子有畏羞的習慣，將來對事物會逡巡不前，故步自封，變成負型的人格。又如「頑强」則可能擴成殘忍剛愎，而爲人們懼恨。</p>
<p>且不要因兒電怕黑暗而責備他們，嚴厲責備的結果，恰與你所預想的相左，反促成兒童卑怯的性情，增加了一層棘手的難症。兒童在二三歲初學語言及剛入幼稚國時，他們的經騐領域擴大了，故常有應付不及的情形，這時最易在精神上鑄成某種形態。尤其受父母溺愛，過份保護的兒童，一入新環境即能發生徬徨無揹，恐懼哭泣的變態行爲。但請亦不必單怪他們不中用，須明瞭行爲性格的養成，不是一旦一夕，同時更改他們，亦不是今天明天的事。恐嚇責打，早已拼葉於有教養者的門外了。</p>
<p>所以我們絕不能由感情的衝動，去管敎兒童們的心理上的癥結。相同的我們亦絕不能在糾正他們行行爲時，反使他們有一種「情緒緊張」的變態。並且得安心靜氣地分析兒童的行爲，解決情緒的困難。在這裏提三個步驟：（一）觀察條析反常的行爲。（二）使兒童明瞭自己的缺陷。（三）暗示解決的方法並幫助之。</p>
<p>例如去解決口吃和懼怕黑暗，一味的譏諷怒責是徙然的。口吃的兒童大都是情緒上的障害非常緊張，甚者有發生痙攣的，他們不能阻止講話時的持久的猶豫不決。或不能控制字和音節之重復。若議笑他學他，反而使他情緒上更不寗，故往往在陌生的場合下，能避免口吃，極力控制牠。因之先須吿訴他口吃的由來，再安慰他慢慢的說話，說得準確就能革除，同時扶助他練習難言的常錯誤的字或詞，使潛伏在深處的情緒結慢慢解除，這樣自能說話流利的。</p>
<p>懼怕黑暗，情形比較簡單，這大都是由交替反應所成。這是什麼意思呢！兒童曾在黑暗地方遇到使精神上身體上不快及不安全的事情，或者在父母的故事談話中得到里暗是可怕恐怖的象微。要解除亦能用交替反應的方法。就是在里暗的場合下，給以愉快的安祥的感覺，逐漸轉移他已有的成見。</p>

<h3>門</h3>
<p>— 張白懷</p>
<p>在夢里，在我底眼光所觸及的理想的地圖的最中心，鮮明的字跡顯示着，有這麼一所華麗的黃金的屋子。</p>
<p>我清醒着的思想告訴了我，這屋子藏着很多很多的幸福，很多很多的溫暖和快樂，此外還永遠永遠地，取之不竭地，藏着整個良善的人類底純凈潔美的忠直的心靈。</p>
<p>於是我覺得無比地快樂，並且笑出聲音來了。我想，這應談是我們底世界的最可驕傲的財富。</p>
<p>我想走過去。我拔開腳步，走過去。</p>
<p>然而，門是緊緊地鎖着的。</p>
<p>我才想到這華麗的屋子，也許還有着它自己的主人。</p>
<p>但我存心要把裏面的這許多珍貴的東西拿出來，一點也不保留地統統拿出來，然後，我公正地，毫不偏私地，把它們分給那些不幸的，貧窮的，沒有幸福，失去愛情，見不到快樂的，可憐的我們底人類之子。</p>
<p>我遂轉而思索一個打開鎖着的門的方法。</p>
<p>我興奮地環顧四周，四周盡是忙着工作的人們，他們有的是為了自己—但更多却是為了大家。他們似乎不知道世界上有這麼一間黃金的屋子，或者，他們雖然知道世界上有這麼一間黃金的屋子，但那却不是他們所能享有的。</p>
<p>我想：不如告訢他們吧！</p>
<p>「朋友們！」我喊，用火熱的聲音喊：「你們知道世界上有一所華麗的屋子嗎？」</p>
<p>他們都愕然的一抬頭，但沒有一個願意回答。</p>
<p>「那屋子裏有着我們一切努力的代價和需要！」我再喊，這回是用啓示的聲音喊。</p>
<p>但他們祗是默默地相互注視着，絲毫沒有相信的意思。</p>
<p>一個微微顫動的聲音飄過來。</p>
<p>「不錯，那一間屋子，緊鎖着門的屋子……」是一個人對他的同伴說的，說得很低，低得祗有他的同伴和我可以聽到。</p>
<p>我立刻看着他，對他微笑。</p>
<p>「但是你們，不是誰都有一把很好的鑰匙嗎？」我和藹地問。</p>
<p>「可是不能」那鎖着的門，已經……已經銹得無法開啟了！」他帶點自卑的神情囁嚅地說。</p>
<p>我很失望，再不能說些什麼。我又突然覺得，這些人都是太怯懦，太善良的，所以他們永遠承担痛苦。</p>
<p>我於是走開，我想我祇有自己去想一個打開鎖着的門的法子了。</p>
<p>我絕不是要攫奪那閃光的燦爛的奇珍，我是想把這些閃光的奇珍拿出米，還給這些太善良的太懦弱的可愛的人們。</p>
<p>我躍過一條很寬闊的渠溝，便走進了一條很堂皇的，熱鬧的街市。這街市的每一家店鋪，櫥窗里都陳列着一切式樣的奇特的鑰匙。</p>
<p>我看見這里的行人都競爭幸福，愛情和快樂的諸種顏色作為外表以炫耀他們各個人自己的財富。他們熙熙攘攘的，空氣里流蘯着女人的脂粉的濃香。</p>
<p>我覺得：這市街是充滿着輕浮，陰險，貪婪和奢侈的。這市街上的人們，我稍加注意，便看出他們早已把純美的心靈拋棄了。</p>
<p>我開始明白，那些終日忙着工作的人們所以保有良善的原因，也漸漸領悟了，他們所以沒有幸福，沒有愛情，見不到快樂的道理。</p>
<p>我想：忙着工作的人們有很多很多的純美的心靈，人的心靈，而陳列着各式各樣的鑰匙的街道上的行人是沒有的。</p>
<p>我想：陳列着各式各樣的鑰匙的街道上的行人有很多很多的幸福，人的幸福，但忙着工作的人們却一點也沒有，</p>
<p>我雖然在想那各式各樣的鑰匙中，一定有一種可以打開那黃金的屋子的門的，但是，我不去找尋。我怕受那些出賣鑰匙的人的欺騙，他們實在是自己也不一定能打開那鎖着的門的，要不然他們決不會缺少那種最重要的最不能缺少的東西。他們炫耀自己的富有，卻不知道靈魂是何等地貧窮。</p>
<p>我仍舊回到那些可愛的人們工作着的地方。我慚愧沒有給他們帶來鑰匙，我祇告訴地們說：</p>
<p>「朋友們，在一所屋裏，一所華麗的黃金的屋子裏，有着我們所需要的，一切幸福的東西。</p>
<p>「那門上的鎖，雖然是無法開啟的，但是，那鎖已經到了锈腐的程度了，祇要，是的，祗要眞理的雷聲一響，它就會被震碎在門檻上，那時，你們就勇敢一點吧！走進去，那些東西是屬於每個人的，我們底新世界裏每個人都應該有的……」</p>
<p>我沒有說完，立刻，轟然一聲，接着一個泥啞的鈍音也跟着散開在地面上，呵，一道彩色的毫光從一間華麗的屋子里直射出來了，宏大的歡呼震響着我快樂得流出眼淚的心……。我一翻身，才看見自己是坐在晒進了陽光的床上。</p>
<h3>阿冬</h3>
<p>— 惲熙</p>
<p>阿冬是七里塘楊家二房東裏的一個丫頭，兩顆骨碌的眼珠同一對烏油的小辮，同樣十分可愛，但太太却認為未免輕骨頭，是底下人的致命傷。她出身紹興府，某年年成大荒歉，被賣到這村窠來，二十塊銀洋便割斷了同親生爺娘的聯繫。因為是冬天來的，所以呌阿冬。</p>
<p>鄕間的老例，賣絕身子的丫頭一長成，倘不蒙老爺或少爺收房，東家便代為覓一丈夫，稍稍施捨一些衣物，送她進入陌生男人的臂彎中，算是了却一椿心願，一邊歎息着：「剛剛學會些生活，又蹓走了！」這時，大抵已有幼小的候補者了。</p>
<p>熬過了十來年的鞭韃和置駡，阿冬終於也出落得非常丰滿，需要異性的熱力來溫存了。她懂得橫在面前的是關係終身幸福的大事，她恍惚看到將來的歡愉，朦朧地閃耀着。她初是熱烈地憧憬着，最後却躊躇起來了。</p>
<p>有兩個年富力強的伙子同時向她表示慇懃。其中一個名呌壽根，另一個名呌發昌。兩個子在農忙季節都被喊到楊家來做幾時短工，因此都有同阿冬親近的機會。在這點上壽根似乎地位更優越些，她娘在楊家三房裏當女傭，他時常借探望老娘的因頭，更多同阿冬兜搭幾句，他靦覥而又勇敢地說着話，顯得十分老實和天真。發昌同壽根一樣，也是楊家的佃戶，但性格更活潑，好奇，有膽量，曾經跑過幾個外埠，見識一廣，一切談吐舉止，便自然比壽根高出一籌，更易吸引一個當於幻想的年青女子。阿冬的態度，在本來具有同等希望的兩伙子間，漸漸顯明地偏向更風趣的一個了。</p>
<p>二老爺二太太對這事似乎抱不干涉態度，老爺認為壽根發昌兩人都還不錯，雖然發昌更討人歡喜些，他郤並不定要阿冬嫁給發昌，太太呢，簡直沒工夫想到這種小事，她是樂天主義者，快活時，嘻嘻哈哈笑一通，躺到床鋪上抽幾筒大煙，適意地睡去了；不快活時向傭人丫頭，兜頭臭罵一陣，躺到床鋪上抽幾筒大煙，仍舊適意地睡去了。</p>
<p>然而，這於壽根的娘陳家嬸郤並非小事，我們得了解一個丈夫亡故只遺獨子的寡婦，經濟的拮据是常事，同時想望抱孫的念頭在她心中佔着第一等位置。雖在鄉下，明媒正娶討一個媳婦，畢竟需要一筆可觀的花費，她明慧的雙眼早就往阿冬身上放下後半世的期望，然而，照目前這形勢發展下去，辛苦織就的好夢不將全盤打破了？</p>
<p>於是她盼望着河東媽媽的到來。</p>
<p>河東媽媽是出眾的媒婆，村中鎭上缺不來的人物。殷勤，會說，善於裝笑，手腳勤快，雖然出身低微，郤能在各處大戶人家進出，博得上下一體的歡迎。她偶爾也帶些禮物過來，如小雞二只，鹹菜半　，回家時籃子照例比出門時更沉重些，夕陽塗紅她的容顏，一顆心分外地輕快。</p>
<p>這一天，河東媽媽到來。陳家嬸接待得分外認眞，一陣泡了三次茶，河東媽媽心裏奇怪，但也不願先問，就裝作若無其事地大談前天鎮上黃家的喜事：新娘娘俊俏是俊俏，只是臉上雀痣瘢多些；老爺太太常常鬧別扭，太太是要場面人，喜歡多賞幾個錢給底下人，老爺卻總要扣起一些，說用錢像削水片，能省幾個就省幾個，……一邊探索陳家嬸的面部表情，心裏納罕對方的好耐性，幸虧最後，陳家嬸畢竟畏葸地開言了。</p>
<p>「媽媽不瞞你說，我有椿心事，想拜託你。」</p>
<p>「你說來好了，我這老身子出得出一分力，那有不幫你忙的。」河東媽媽馬上迎合上去。</p>
<p>「也是婚嫁事體呵，我們壽根歲數也到把了。」</p>
<p>「是噢，好討娘婦了。幸虧壽根是老實人安安穩穩的，不然，這把年紀，早就　狗般四處亂嗅亂鑽了。——看中誰，我替你去說。」</p>
<p>「媽媽，你是明眼人，看得雪亮，也不用我說。」</p>
<p>「眞的不曉得呵。」</p>
<p>二老爺房裏的阿冬，還有</p>
<p>「噢——」媽媽終究忍不住，格格地笑出來了；這……便當……你向二老爺太太設聲，不就成了」</p>
<p>「怎好自己去說啊，況且——頓住了，隨着便一五一十將自己的難處訴說着，河東媽媽是絕頂的好人，當然滿口答應下來。</p>
<p>「這樁事體全靠在你身上啊！」</p>
<p>「不要這樣客氣，自家人幫帮忙算什麼，等會到二老爺家，一準提起好了。」</p>
<p>兩人並排坐在灶後矮凳上，柴火照亮浮着微笑的皺臉，兩顆心像火一般溫暖。</p>
<p>河東媽媽來到二房裏，太太正在吞雲吐霧。媽媽一屁股挨到床舖上，重複談一陣鎮上黃家的喜事，轉彎抹角地引到正題目上，然後充份加以發揮。</p>
<p>「不瞞你說，我倒是無可無不可的，」太太打了個懶懶的呵欠，「回頭間聲老爺，只要他肯，我沒有不依的。」說着裝上一個烟泡。</p>
<p>「不過要太太看我老婆子臉上，老爺門前上說句好話。」</p>
<p>「好好，我太太好帮忙，不會不帮忙的，……不過，對你老實講，嫁一個丫頭，小零破碎物件，好歹有幾樣，衣裳呢，也有幾件，但比不得小姐的樣，像樣是像樣不出來的。」太太的口氣忽然嚴重了。</p>
<p>「噯，太太說那裏話，她是討人不討貨，只要老爺太太答應，單她一根人棍子過來，陳家嬸也是心滿意足了。」</p>
<p>「好吧，你坐一歇，回頭老爺轉來，你向他說說看。」</p>
<p>「是是，但總要請太太帮襯帮襯啊！」河東媽媽又格格笑着。</p>
<p>老爺起初是躊躇，繼而提出小小的反駁，但經不起河東媽媽長江大河似的議諭，一連串非答應不可的請求，心就軟下來了。太太也不負囑託，時而從煙霧中飛出一二佼語，例如：</p>
<p>「壽根家就在對河，將來有啥使喚，換換也便當。」</p>
<p>「我說發昌這小子心頭很活，說不定拐到老婆，一蹓烟砲到外鄉去，連東家也忘記了。」</p>
<p>「陳家嬸雖說是三弟家的傭人，我們也時常差喚到，這點兒好處總該給她。」</p>
<p>老爺乾笑了兩聲，說：</p>
<p>「好好，由你們的，我本不說阿冬定該歸發昌。」</p>
<p>當下河東媽媽興奮地拐着小腳，宣召阿冬進來，由老爺太太嚴重地頒布了她丈夫的名字。然後習慣地問一聲，「你覺得怎樣？」</p>
<p>阿冬怔住了，不說一句話，像受了雷擊。最後，她揉着眼，慢慢地踅出去，郤躲入自己臥房裏，嗚咽地抽泣起來。</p>
<p>老爺可發愁了：女人，遲早得嫁老公，伈伈睍睍哭什麼？抹挺喉嚨就罵：「爛汚皮，敢哭出來！再哭，老子送你進陰間！」太太郤心平氣和的，一把拉住老爺激動的肩頭，悄聲勸道：「何必大發肝火呢，女孩子家心眼狹窄，看不開，哭一場也就完事了。」</p>
<p>河東媽媽畢竟心腸軟，過意不去。她親自駕臨阿冬住的小房問裏，用政府要員開導一個革命叛徒的精神善意去勸慰這淚人兒。</p>
<p>「啊喲！你不想想，老爺太太也是為你的好呀！發倡這小伙子，活鮮是活鮮的，要說真正靠得住便難講了。人家外頭跑得多，世面大，心眼活落落的，難保不出亂子啊！……老話說得好，聰明人自誤自，倒是壽根這種人，老老實實，終身終世靠得住……嫁雞隨雞，嫁狗隨狗，你也得圖個長久計啊！……」</p>
<p>阿冬用手背拭着淚，漸漸抬起頤來，茫然看一眼河東媽媽，隨即轉移視綫，呆呆注視庭院裏十許隻飛奔的雞雛，不說一句話。</p>
<p>「再說，練家嬸人是頂和氣不過的，她又只一個兒子，一家子沒得什麼爭的，有啥事體，三個人好說好話……房子也有，田地也有，喫得飽，着得暖，你還希罕什麼？」</p>
<p>奇怪，阿冬突地又抽泣起來了。</p>
<p>「啊喲喲，又哭了，還有什麼放不開的？……你也得見乖些，別這樣倔強了，老爺的性子，你也是曉得的，你順順當當依他，他也待你好，你鬧彆扭，他偏要你照他的做，到後仍得依他，何不如早聽話，大家開開心心的。……」</p>
<p>雖解不至於舌敝唇焦，河東媽螞確也費了九牛二虎之力了。幸虧精神所至，金石為開，阿冬果然回心轉意，在河東媽媽的催迫下，微微頷首，表示伏貼。</p>
<p>河東媽媽大為欣喜，即時帶着勝利消息，奔告陳家嬸，兩人隨着請三老爺查考歷本，選定個好日子，送一份禮到二房裏算是訂了婚。</p>
<p>陳家嬸抱孫心切，結婚吉日，就定在今年冬天。二太太雖嫌太過着緊，嘆一口氣，也答應了。倒是壽根和阿冬，都羞答答的，雙方竭力避開碰頭的機會。陳家嬸的面皮也似乎發嫩起來，當着阿冬面前，怪不好意思的。</p>
<p>至於發昌，郤一下變得極其沉默，嘴巴彷彿上了鎖。以後連楊家也難得來了。不知怎麼一來，突然為痢疾帶去了生命。</p>
<p>河東媽媽逢人便誇說自己的好眼光，她說：</p>
<p>「我早看定發昌的人中生得短，活不長久。我勸阿冬嫁不得他，年紀輕輕，做孤孀，啥開心？……幸虧阿冬總算乖巧，肯聽我的話，不是嗎？今見可應騐了。」</p>
<p>大家都以為然，阿冬心頭的疙痛也平復了。她無以報答，就拜河東媽媽做寄娘。</p>

<h3>雙宿雙飛（六四）</h3>
<p>— 趙清閣</p>
<p>十二</p>
<p>墨太太像熱鍋上的螞蟻似的，急于想使自己的夢幻實現，於是就在許多人的慫恿之下，經石玉樓介紹，終于決定從新年的元旦起，讓麗華登台試唱三天戲！由張弦和戲團經理講好這三天是「打泡」（票的意思）的性質，不取分文報酬。如果成功了，三天以後便正式下海，再談報酬。同時麗雲也登台試唱。張弦替他們排了三天的戲碼，麗華的第一天是「遊龍戲鳳」；第二天是「女起解」；第三天是「教子」。麗雲的第一天是「捉放曹」，第二天是「黃鶴樓」，第三天是和麗華合唱「教子」。麗華的戲碼，排在前面第三齣，麗雲的戲碼排在前面第二齣。</p>
<p>原則決定之後，張弦便趕着教他們把這幾齣學過的戲，又重新溫習一遍，並且還彩排了一次。彩排的成績，不用說總是麗華優于麗雲。無論是唱工，或是做工。麗華一聽一看就會；麗雲却要聽上許多次；看上許多次；然後再學上許多次；才會。會而又不精。因次張弦常常罵麗雲：沒有天资也罷，還不知用心。但麗華也不用心，麗華的成功就全憑着她的天資聰明。她除了為着要滿足求知慾，私下把戲本子當作書讀以外，很少自動去練習練習戲的技術方面。也奇怪，儘管她不練習，她也並不忘記。這使張弦相當驚服！他想難為她，都撫從難為她；可心裏喜歡起；又不敢輕易惹她。</p>
<p>麗華已經學會了上十齣的全本戲，此外還學會了些不是主演的部分配唱的戲。她如今把學戲常作了一種對墨太太以及對張弦應盡的義務，她每天含着眼淚敷衍她的必修課程，她不再向墨太太和張弦違抗他們所要她作的一切，她知道違抗也是沒有用的。所以彩排的時候，她機械地任着大家擺佈，她一聲不哼。平日，她除了學戲必須開口以外，也不大言語。她不理張弦；也不和墨太太多說話；連麗雲，她都很少同她在一起玩了。她變得更緘默；沈群；終日像一個成人的少女，直呆坐在屋裏，不是看書；便是做針綫。孩子時代的天真，已經遠遠地遠遠地離開了她！</p>
<p>麗雲却還是那麼快活，戲學得不好，挨打受氣她當時哭一陣子，過後也就忘了。特別是這程子她很高興，因為翁二太太哄着她，叫她趕快用心學戲，新年好給她作花衣服，買洋囝囝。彩排的那天，她惑到非常濃厚的興趣！她帶着紗帽，穿上藍袍；腳登一雙高底靴子；胸前還掛了長長的一把鬍鬚。她簡直得意極了！她由未完十歲的年齡，變成了一個老頭子。像這樣的玩法，她還是第一次，她希望以後能常常這樣的玩兒。為了她把唱戲當作了玩兒，所以她便疏忽了藝術上的學習。但她有一個長處，就是不怯場，不害羞，彩徘的時候別人看她，她滿不在乎，彷彿她不知道有別人在，她竟大着胆子，厚着面皮，而且鑼鼓一響，她反而比平常唱得起勁些。儘管你說她不好。</p>

<h3>Resuming Transportation and the Northeast Truce: The Three-Person Meeting Has Reached an Agreement; Adjourns Today, Discusses Troop Reorganization Tomorrow</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 14th] The military three-person meeting commenced at 9:00 AM today and concluded at 1:30 PM, making it the longest session to date. The representatives from all three parties remained the same as yesterday. Today's agenda focused on resuming transportation and the Northeast truce. It is reported that both sides have come close on these two issues and have reached an agreement. Once an agreement is reached on the troop reorganization plan, both will be signed simultaneously.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 24th] Today marked the third meeting since the formal resumption of the military three-person group. The discussions have generally been satisfactory. However, the crucial element for peace talks remains in the next five days. Of the three major issues that must be resolved in this meeting, the first two have already been agreed upon, while the most important issue of troop reorganization has yet to be formally discussed. The three-person meeting is scheduled to adjourn tomorrow for one day, and the fourth meeting will continue the day after tomorrow to discuss troop reorganization. The purpose of the adjournment is to allow both parties sufficient time to prepare for the meeting on troop reorganization. It is reported that Xu Yongchang will visit [General] [Thomas] [Tracy] [Handy] tomorrow to discuss the content of the meeting the day after tomorrow. The agreement reached on the restoration of transportation will be announced on the 30th.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 24th] Representatives of the third party invited government representatives to a meeting at the National Assembly Hall this afternoon. The government representatives included Shao Lizi, Lei Zhen, Zhang Lisheng, Wang Yunwu, and Zeng. Minister Zhang Lisheng delivered a lengthy report. The meeting ended at 7:00 PM.</p>
<h3>Authorities in Beijing Arrest Perpetrators of the "Xiaguan Incident"; Responsible Police Chief Dismissed</h3>
<p>The CCP Prepares a Memorandum to Send to the Three-Person Meeting</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 24th] Regarding the situation at Xiaguan Railway Station last night, when this reporter left Xiaguan at 10:30 PM, I saw refugees gathered in front of the station. After 11:00 PM, the refugees insisted on Ma Xulun appearing, but Ma refused to leave his room, leading to the beating incident. According to statistics, those injured included Ma Xulun from Shanghai, Lei Jieqiong, Chen Zhenzhong, Pu Xixiu (reporter from Xinmin Daily), Gao Ji (reporter from Ta Kung Pao), Xu Bin (reporter from Yi Shi Bao), Xu Shinian (reporter from Da Zhong Bao), Qian Jiangchao (information officer of the municipal government), a passerby, Ji Zeng, a police officer from the Military Police Corps, Gao Chengxiang, a platoon leader of the military police, and Liao Qixian and Li Zhengcai, station military police. The injuries varied in severity. After the incident, they were escorted to the Central Hospital for treatment by the Garrison Headquarters. As for the perpetrators, the military police authorities arrested Tang Shouhua, Zhang Mingyuan, Cao Chuansen, Jing Changfa, Wang Minghua, Han Xuechun, Yan Yiping, and Lu Qi amidst the chaos. They are currently detained at the headquarters of the First Military Police Regiment and will be investigated according to the law.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 24th] The Ministry of Interior has taken seriously the clash that occurred last night at Nanjing's Xiaguan Railway Station between refugees from northern Jiangsu and those so-called anti-civil war petitioners from Shanghai. Yu Zhan, the chief of the police station responsible for the area, was dismissed for failing to prevent the incident. Yu Yiqun, the chief of the Xiaguan Police Bureau, was given a major demerit, and Han Wenfu, the chief of the Capital Police Department, was given a reprimand. Minister Zhang of the Ministry of Interior stated that he would order his subordinates to provide thorough protection for social order and the safety of the people at all times.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 24th] The CCP delegation prepared a memorandum regarding the "Xiaguan Incident," which was divided into three points, mainly requesting guarantees that similar incidents would not occur in the future, and the punishment of the perpetrators, etc. It was rushed to the three-person meeting at 10:00 PM tonight.</p>
<h3>Sympathy for the Plight of Refugees is Natural, But Violence is Inexcusable: Spokesperson for the Central Propaganda Department Expresses Opinion</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 24th] When asked about the public clash at Xiaguan Railway Station last night, the spokesperson for the Central Propaganda Department replied as follows: "The clash at Nanjing's Xiaguan Railway Station last night between refugees from northern Jiangsu and those so-called anti-civil war petitioners from Shanghai is regrettable. While we sympathize with the plight of the distressed refugees, their resort to violence is inexcusable. It is especially regrettable that reporters from Xinmin Daily, Ta Kung Pao, and Yi Shi Bao, as well as several military police officers, were injured. The local authorities will thoroughly investigate and punish those responsible for the violence to serve as a warning. At a time when the government and American friends are working hard to find a peaceful solution, all movements inciting the masses must be stopped. Such incitement will inevitably cause disturbances, even bloodshed, and hinder the progress of peace talks."</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 24th] Today, Minister Peng Xuefeng of the Central Propaganda Department sent Secretary Deng Youde and Deputy Director Huang Xiangshan to the Beijing offices of Ta Kung Pao, Yi Shi Bao, and Xinmin Daily to express condolences to reporters Gao Ji, Xu Bin, and Pu Xixiu, who were mistakenly injured by refugees.</p>
<p>Number of Injured</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 24th] Yesterday's edition of this newspaper briefly reported on the attack on Ma Xulun and others by refugees from northern Jiangsu at Xiaguan last night. According to further investigation by our reporter today, Ma Xulun, Lei Jieqiong, Chen Zhenzhong, Yan Baohang, Ye Duyi (representative of the China Democratic League), and reporters from Ta Kung Pao, Xinmin Daily, and Yi Shi Bao, a total of ten people, were injured in the chaos. Last night, the local military police dispersed the crowd and transported them to the Central Hospital branch on Taiping Road. Except for Ma Xulun, Chen Zhenzhong, Lei Jieqiong, Yan Baohang, and Ye Duyi, who were hospitalized for rest, the others left the hospital after receiving treatment. From 2:00 AM to 10:00 AM this morning, Zhou Enlai, Deng Yingchao, Teng Daiyuan, Guo Moruo, and Shao Lizi visited to express their condolences. The hospitalized individuals were transferred to the main Central Hospital on Huangpu Road at 11:00 AM this morning. In the afternoon, Li Dequan, the wife of Feng Yuxiang, and others visited the hospital. According to the doctors, all five suffered external injuries and were not in serious condition. They can be discharged after two or three days of rest. When the reporter saw Ma Xulun, Ma had just woken up from a nap. He had no visible injuries on his face and was in good spirits. He was lying leisurely in bed, wearing a white silk short shirt and trousers. Ms. Lei Jieqiong, a professor at Soochow University, had the most serious injuries, with only a scratch on the corner of her right eye from glass and some bruises on both arms. Her body temperature was normal, and she had a long conversation with the reporter. Chen Zhenzhong was hit on the head but has recovered. Yan Baohang, the manager of Shanghai Daming Company, claimed he was temporarily pulled into the petitioning group and was upset about injuring his right eye.</p>
<p>Reports from Various Individuals</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 24th] Bao Dasan, Zhang Xiangbo, Sheng Pihua, Huang Yanfang, and Chen Lifu, who are considered representatives of the people, gave an oral report on the Xiaguan incident yesterday at a meeting between the third party and government representatives. Huang Yanfang reported on the petitioning process and the circumstances of their departure from Shanghai. Sheng Pihua reported on the circumstances of being beaten at Xiaguan last night. Zhang Xiangbo reported on the purpose of their petition in Beijing and their mission. Chen Lifu, a student representative, told the reporter that the purpose of the petition was to address the rising prices in Shanghai so that students could have a place to study in peace. This reporter interviewed the five representatives separately. They believe that apart from recovering the items lost during the beatings, they do not wish to pursue legal action.</p>
<p>Shao Lizi Speaks</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 24th] Regarding the incident last night in which the so-called representatives of the people of Shanghai were beaten at Xiaguan, it is now being referred to as the "Xiaguan Incident." Today, this reporter asked Mr. Shao Lizi for his views on the "Xiaguan Incident." Shao said, "I believe that the attitude of their representatives is very good. At the same time, they also want to downplay the matter and not pursue legal action. This attitude is very good."</p>
<p>Ulterior Motives</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 24th] Today, this reporter visited various parties to inquire about the details of the incident in which Ma Xulun and others were beaten by refugees. It is reported that the government was unaware of this matter beforehand, resulting in injuries to the municipal government information officer and four military police officers, which was witnessed by the public. The security authorities are currently investigating the truth of the incident and have already apprehended eight people at the scene, who will be dealt with impartially according to the law. It is also said by qualified individuals that the feelings of grief and anger among the refugees from northern Jiangsu have reached a boiling point, bordering on desperation. They not only hate the Communists but also often complain about the government's forbearance. The seriousness of the refugee problem is well-known. To say that the refugees caused the incident or were instigated by the government is either speculation or motivated by ulterior motives. The government is able to treat the CCP and other party members with courtesy and allow them to gather in the capital to discuss national affairs openly, so why would it fear a few people like Ma Xulun and others who claim to be people's representatives coming to Beijing to petition? Clearly, those who are deliberately exaggerating the incident and blaming the government are doing so because Ma Xulun and others were not killed and a bloody incident was not created.</p>
<h3>Spokesperson for the Ministry of National Defense Rebukes CCP Suggestions (Continued from Yesterday)</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 24th] As for (1) the first point raised by the CCP representatives, which states, "The three-person meeting should immediately announce a long-term truce in the Northeast and reaffirm the national truce order. Regarding the truce order, the government has already issued it twice, and both times it was agreed to by the Communist side. However, it has been completely violated by the Communist army. Therefore, whether the truce order can be effective depends entirely on the Communist army's sincerity in complying with it. If the Communist army immediately ceases all offensives, then complete peace can be achieved immediately. Why wait for the order to be reaffirmed?" (2) The second point raised by the CCP representatives states, "The three-person meeting should immediately negotiate concrete measures to restore national transportation and first repair important railways." Regarding the restoration of national transportation, it has been specifically mentioned in previous truce orders. After the Japanese surrender and before the truce order was issued, all railways in North China were unobstructed. After the truce order was issued, the Communist Party took advantage of the National Army's compliance with the truce order and lack of reinforcements for defense to launch a major attack on the railways from the mountains, seizing cities and destroying the nation's arteries in sections. Except for the Beining Railway, which can barely maintain full-line traffic but is still subject to attacks, the remaining lines have been severely damaged by the Communist army. After February of this year, the three members of the military three-person group, [General George C.] Marshall, Zhang Zhizhong, and Zhou Enlai, issued an agreement to restore transportation immediately. The Beijing Executive Headquarters issued Order No. 4 on February 11 to implement it. The Ministry of Transportation also prepared personnel and equipment to repair the railways and organized engineering teams to begin repairs, but all were obstructed by the Communist army and could not proceed. On March 10, the three members, Marshall, Zhang, and Zhou, inspected various places in North China and personally witnessed the cities and towns along the railways being besieged by the Communist army and the transportation being obstructed. Three agreements were also established: 1. Lift the siege of various cities; 2. Remove restrictions on the freedom of movement of the people; 3. Do not delay the restoration of railways on any pretext. However, the Communist army in various places not only continued to obstruct repairs but also intensified the destruction. Millions of people are still displaced and unable to return home. (3) The third point proposed by the CCP representatives: "The three-person meeting should periodically negotiate concrete supplementary measures for troop reorganization and demobilization in the country and the Northeast." Since the two sides signed the basic plan for troop reorganization and the integration of CCP troops into the National Army on February 25 of this year, the government has followed the regulations, submitted rosters on time, and implemented the reorganization. It has now entered the second phase and will be completed on time. However, the Communist side has not yet followed the provisions of Article 4 of the plan to submit the preliminary work plan for the reorganization of its troops, including the nature, strength, weapons, names of commanders above the brigade level, and the locations of various units to the military group. The Communist army's lack of sincerity in implementing the reorganization is evident. (4) The fourth point proposed by the CCP is even more hollow and unrealistic. Before the military conflict can be stopped, to mention the convening of a political consultative conference and equating political issues with the truce order is the height of their delaying tactics. Stopping the conflict, restoring transportation, and implementing the troop reorganization plan are the urgent priorities at present. If the Communist army acts with sincerity, these three issues can be resolved on time, and political issues can also be solved easily. If the Communist side continues to create unnecessary obstacles and attempts to delay time, then its responsibility for destroying peace and unity and hindering national construction will be even more obvious.

<h3>The Beijing Provisional Council is Established Today; Chairman Chiang Issues Special Instructions</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Peiping, 24th] The Peiping Provisional Council has been in preparation for several months and is now ready to formally convene on the 25th. Chairman Chiang issued special instructions, urging them in three points: (1) The urgent task at hand is to quickly restore social order, practice economy, and increase production. The food shortage is severe everywhere. How to practice economy, manage the situation well, investigate hoarding, and advocate disaster relief to overcome the difficulties; (2) At present, ensuring the strictness and clarity of the Baojia organization is a practical plan, and supporting the virtuous and upholding justice should be mutually reinforcing, so that the implementation of government orders can be promoted and the people's hearts can be directed; (3) The state's war of resistance against foreign aggression was unavoidable, and the people were levied taxes and levies to defend the nation and the people. It is hoped that you will understand the government's heart of treating the people as children and widely guide the people to the meaning of sacrifice for the country, encourage the people to abide by the laws, supervise the government, and eliminate greed. The mountains are high and the roads are long, and there is no way to meet. I hereby express what I have in mind and wish to encourage each other together.</p>
<h3>The Atmosphere in the Military Mediation Department is Stagnant; The Communist Army in Shanxi Launches a Widespread Offensive; Taiyuan and Datong are Surrounded on All Sides</h3>
<p>[Our Peiping Dispatch, 24th] The Executive Headquarters has forwarded the order to extend the truce for eight days to all groups for compliance, but the atmosphere in Xiehe Hospital seems unoptimistic. An official spokesperson pointed out the severity of the current situation in Shanxi, which is even more serious than in Shandong. The intersection of the Tongpu and Zhengtai railways southeast of Taiyuan is currently under siege. The highway west of Taiyuan leading to Wenshui and Jiaocheng has also been destroyed, and Taiyuan is almost surrounded. After the fall of Shuoxian, Datong's only connection to the cities defended by the National Army has also been severed. Datong has almost become an isolated island outside Yanmen Pass. In southern Shanxi, the Communist army continues to besiege Quwo, and the situation in Jiangxian is also very critical. In Shandong, the Communist army is attempting to attack the water source of Qingdao, Huangbu, and Fanjiacun. The grain routes around Jinan have been blocked, and the situation is also worrying. The Communist army on the PingSui Railway has a tendency to encircle Nankou. Nie Rongzhen's troops of 15,000 men are attacking Yangfang in one direction and Baijiakou west of Nankou in another, attempting to cut off the PingSui Railway. An official spokesperson also pointed out that there are still small-scale conflicts in the Northeast. The spokesperson refused to comment on how the situation will develop after the eight-day extension expires, only repeatedly answering "hard to say."</p>
<p>[Our Peiping Dispatch, 24th] The CCP representative of the Datong Executive Group has withdrawn from Datong. Officials said this is a prelude to the completion of the encirclement and the start of the offensive by the Communist army.</p>
<p>Also, when the Communist army attacked Wenjiashi, County Magistrate Wu Deming and others died in the line of duty.</p>
<p>[Our Jinan Dispatch, 23rd] The Communist army has gradually withdrawn from the outposts around Jinan, but the number of Communist troops continues to increase, and it seems that there is an intention to attack Jinan. Also, Zhao Guangyu's regiment in Dawenkou is still holding on to the core. On the night of the 22nd, the underground bunkers were destroyed by the Communist army, and the situation was critical. After a desperate defense, it was stabilized.</p>

<h3>Mao Zedong Issues a Statement Opposing U.S. Military Aid to China</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Peiping, 24th] Mao Zedong stated in a public statement in Yan'an yesterday that the CCP firmly opposes the U.S. State Department's proposal submitted to Congress on June 15 to continue military aid to China. He also stated that U.S. military aid to China is armed intervention. What the Chinese people urgently need is not U.S. weapons and troops stationed in China. Under these circumstances, the CCP has no choice but to oppose the U.S. government's continued supply of weapons to the Kuomintang government and the dispatch of U.S. military delegations to China. It also demands that the United States immediately stop the so-called military aid to China and withdraw its troops stationed in China.</p>

<h3>Military Traitors Yang Kuiyi and Two Other Renegades Were Executed by Firing Squad in Nanjing Yesterday; The Trial of Traitor Qi Xieyuan Has Concluded and His Death is Not Far Off; Veteran Traitor Yin Rugeng is Scheduled for Public Trial the Day After Tomorrow</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 24th] Yang Kuiyi, a military traitor who was the director of the puppet Wuhan Pacification Office, Ling Xiao, the puppet Minister of the Navy, and Hu Yukun, the puppet Chief of Staff of the Military Affairs Committee and puppet Minister of Military Orders, have been tried by the Military Law Department. It was determined that the three traitors, Yang, Ling, and Hu, colluded with the enemy, organized puppet troops, and resisted the government. The evidence was conclusive and their treasonous acts were obvious. The three traitors were sentenced to death at 11:30 AM today. Guo Yiguang was appointed by the Military Law Department as the execution supervisor, and the three traitors were taken by car to the Yuhuatai execution ground at 12:20 PM for execution by firing squad. They arrived at the execution ground at 12:42 PM. The three criminals were lined up in a row, and the execution soldiers used rifles to execute them. Yang was hit by one shot, Ling was hit by three shots, and both fell to the ground and died. Hu was hit by eight shots before he died. It is reported that Yang was 53 years old and from Hubei, Ling was 59 years old and from Chongde, Zhejiang, and Hu was 55 years old and from Liaoning, Northeast China.

<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 24th] Wang Shiheng, a major traitor in North China who was the director of the Finance Office and the president of the puppet United Reserve Bank, has been brought to Nanjing for trial.

<h3>The Jiangsu High Court Issues a Ruling: Chu Niyi Granted Retrial, Justified by Preservation of National Father's Remains and Writings</h3>
<p>[Special dispatch from our Suzhou office, 24th] Chu Niyi, the traitor, had his death sentence upheld by the Supreme Court, with the approval already a full month ago. All circles anticipated his imminent execution. However, his wife, Chu Chen Shunzhen, suddenly, on the day following the execution of the traitor Chen Gongbo, applied to the Jiangsu High Court for a retrial. At the time, public opinion was universally shocked, as there was no precedent for such a case, and it was believed that the application would certainly be rejected. After receiving the retrial application and various new exonerating pieces of evidence, the Jiangsu High Court, after several meetings and studies by the original trial staff, issued Criminal Ruling No. 4 on retrials at approximately 3:00 PM on the 24th. The main text: "This case is granted a retrial." The reasons are recorded separately. After hearing the news, our reporter specially visited Mr. Sun Hong, the presiding judge of the original trial, who stated: "The decision to grant Chu Niyi a retrial is based on his preservation of the National Father's remains and writings. It cannot be said that he did not perform a minor service. If this is correct, it should be cited as a reason for mitigating his sentence, to show that the law is neither unjust nor lenient. As for the rumor that an American named Wharton intervened, that is a complete fabrication. Even if such a thing were to happen, this court absolutely cannot change his criminal responsibility because of it."</p>
<p>Reasons for Retrial</p>
<p>The defendant's case involved being a traitor, and after the verdict by this court, it was upheld and approved by the Supreme Court. Now, the applicant argues that the defendant, in 1942, went to Beiping to negotiate with the Japanese army, retrieved the National Father's remains, and respectfully escorted them to Nanjing to be enshrined in the mausoleum. The National Father's writings and belongings stored in his Shanghai residence during his lifetime were sealed by the Japanese army. The applicant says the defendant forcefully argued, and was able to get back those historical items such as the original manuscript of the National Father's "Sun Wen's Doctrine" and the "Fundamentals of National Reconstruction" handwritten by the National Father on "How to save the Country and Revolution." Also, the knives and swords worn by the National Father during his lifetime were also carefully preserved by the defendant. The Nanjing Ninghai Detention Center has a detailed record of the above facts. The initial trial overlooked this important evidence favorable to the defendant, which is a reason for a retrial. This court believes that while the defendant's collusion with the enemy and treason are indeed deserving of punishment, if the applicant's statements are true, then the matter concerns loyalty to the National Father and preservation of documents, which is not without the circumstances described in Article 3 of the Regulations on Handling Traitor Cases. The original definitive judgment did not consider this point, and therefore, there is reason for a retrial. Based on the above discussion, in accordance with Article 1, Article 28, Paragraph 2 of the Special Criminal Cases Litigation Regulations, and Article 428, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Procedure Law, the ruling is as stated in the main text.</p>
<h3>Two Other Traitor Cases Were Heard Yesterday But Not Decided</h3>
<p>[Special dispatch from our Suzhou office, 24th] At approximately 4:00 PM on the 24th, the Jiangsu High Court retried Liu Dui, who had falsely served as the secretary of the puppet provincial government, a professor at the Art College's School of Literature, a member of the provincial government's seal committee, and head of the education department. He admitted these false positions without hesitation. However, he excused himself by claiming coercion from the environment and the need to maintain his livelihood. He also argued that he rescued underground work comrades and preserved the artifacts of Soochow University, and claimed that he committed no misdeeds while in the false positions, requesting a lighter sentence. The court hearing lasted approximately 30 minutes before concluding, and the court ordered a postponement for further questioning, and the traitor Zhang was returned to custody.</p>
<p>[Special dispatch from our Suzhou office, 24th] At approximately 4:00 PM on the 24th, the Jiangsu High Court heard the case of Chen Boqi, suspected of being a traitor for falsely serving as a pilot in the puppet air force. Because Chen confessed that his father was an American citizen and his mother was Chinese, the court ordered that his nationality be investigated before further questioning. Chen was returned to custody.</p>
<h3>Wang Jingwei's Son-in-Law, He Wenjie, Scheduled for Sentencing on the 30th</h3>
<p>[Special dispatch from our Nanjing office, 24th] Wang Jingwei's son-in-law, the pseudo "Imperial Son-in-Law," He Wenjie, was retried by the High Court at 10:00 AM on the 24th, with Chief Judge Ge presiding. He stated that he was still serving Chen Gongbo in his false position and denied any guilt. The presiding judge asked about his feelings regarding Wang Jingwei's death and Chen Gongbo's sentence of life imprisonment. He claimed that he always admired Wang Jingwei's character and views. The prosecutor then requested a judgment according to the law because He did not show remorse for his crimes. When He was answering the defense, he frequently looked to the right, peering at his wife, Wang Wenxing, and forcing a smile. At 11:20 AM, the debate ended, and it was announced that the sentencing would be delivered at 10:00 AM on the 30th.</p>

The criminal was the chief of staff of the Dingqi Security Team and had used his position to transport 703 catties of Western merchant opium with armed escort. The Suiyuan authorities are currently investigating the planting of opium seedlings in mountain clearings or vacant farmland areas. Once discovered, the land will be immediately cleared and the roots removed.

<h3>Local dispatches</h3>
<p>Passengers Arriving in Hangzhou from Shanghai Given Epidemic Prevention Injections</p>
<p>[Express News from our Hangzhou office] Hangzhou is densely populated, and as summer arrives, the risk of epidemics is concerning. Shanghai and Hangzhou are just a short distance away, making transmission very easy. In order to prevent this, the Municipal Health Bureau, in addition to implementing epidemic prevention injections for the public in the city, has also dispatched epidemic prevention teams stationed at the passenger exits of the railway station. All travelers arriving from Shanghai are given epidemic prevention injections. For the clear and refreshing beverages sold on the market, such as shaved ice, sour plum soup, frozen dates, cold noodles, cold dishes, and agar made from wooden lotus seeds, in addition to sending personnel to strictly prohibit them at any time, a special letter has been sent to the provincial police department for assistance.</p>
<p>Traitor's Death Sentence Changed to Life Imprisonment: Li Baozu, a famous traitor in Hangzhou, who previously appealed the initial judgment of the Zhejiang High Court, has now been heard that the original death sentence has been reduced to life imprisonment in the appeal. Also, Feng Xuzhou, a traitor from Shaoxing, also appealed the initial trial. It was recently heard that the Zhejiang High Court had ordered a retrial. However, this traitor died in the First Prison a few days ago, so this case does not need to be retried.</p>

<p>Public Asks for Prohibition of Using Rice as Rent</p>
<p>The Wujin County Temporary Consultative Council will soon hold its second meeting. Recently, many people jointly wrote to the council, requesting that they forward their request to the relevant authorities to strictly prohibit landlords from forcibly calculating rent in white rice, in order to reduce the burden on the majority of the common people. They also requested that the council include the case of prohibiting white rice as rent on the agenda for detailed discussion of a fair handling and punishment method, so as to alleviate the suffering of the small people. Ma Yuanchao, chief of the Land Administration Section of the County Government, and Liu Guanqun, secretary of the County Party Headquarters, also believe that the prohibition of using rice as rent is indeed an urgent matter that should be implemented immediately.</p>

<p>Wuhu</p>
<p>Passenger Vehicles on Wuhu Routes Repeatedly Robbed: Robberies of vehicles on the Wuhu routes are almost daily occurrences. Travelers hesitate to travel. At 8:00 AM on the 19th, two passenger vehicles that came from Hefei, carrying approximately 50 passengers and local goods, were robbed. The first vehicle drove to the edge of a mountain near the boundary of Chao County and Hanyou. Suddenly, seven plainclothes bandits, who had been ambushing on the left side of the road, opened fire. Three passengers were shot and killed, and the driver and another passenger were injured. Everyone was robbed, with losses of about 30 million yuan. Before the bandits could get far up the mountain, the second vehicle arrived. Unexpectedly, the vehicle's tire burst at the scene of the incident, and it could not move. The bandits turned back down, and the passengers were terrified. Fortunately, there were two armed guards on the vehicle who quickly yelled and fought back. Knowing that they were prepared, the bandits left. The vehicle did not arrive in Wuhu until the afternoon. In addition to the injured driver, one dead passenger had followed the Henyun cargo to Wuhu. The remaining one dead and one injured passenger remained at the scene of the incident.</p>

<h3>Basic Concepts for Resolving the China Problem—An Appeal to the Kuomintang and the Communist Party and a Contribution to Third Parties Who Consider Themselves Mediators—</h3>
<p>— Liu Muhua</p>
<p>I</p>
<p>After the 15-day truce expired and was extended for another eight days, everyone breathed a sigh of relief, and some people began to harbor extravagant hopes, thinking that the Communist Party might change its attitude in this last opportunity, and that all difficult problems might be resolved in a reluctant manner. This view cannot be said to be without some partial justification, but if we carefully consider the current reality of China, and the social and international political background hidden behind the disputes, it is not difficult to find the superficiality of this vague optimism. And precisely because people generally view it so superficially, they simply do not recognize the existence of the historical and objective conditions of the problem itself, which further increases the serious difficulties of the situation.</p>
<p>To solve the current problem, it is essential to first understand where the crux of the domestic problem lies. In other words, what we want to ask now is: What are the government and the Communist Party fighting for? Can that dispute be resolved peacefully? More realistically, is there another way to seek China's revolution besides one-party dictatorship? What is the distance between the Principle of People's Livelihood and Communism?... These are the most fundamental questions.</p>
<p>In short, the current internal conflict in China is the political struggle between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party. In essence, this political struggle should be a struggle of ideologies and policies to be reasonable. In reality, however, the two parties have engaged in relatively little dispute over ideologies and policies. The Political Consultative Conference held in Chongqing, apart from passing the principles for amending the draft constitution, which can be considered something tangible, the rest of the discussions revolved around the distribution of government personnel, the distribution of National Assembly representatives, the distribution of troops and territories, and so on. Some people believe that the Communist Party's goal is only to share some "official positions and emoluments," and that their military activities are merely to gain a favorable position in order to demand a high price. The implication is that the government is also prepared to pay a price, but it cannot be too high. If this were true, it would seem that the current problems in China would be too simple. Unfortunately, the reality is not as simple and easy as one might think. If the Kuomintang and the Communist Party can truly cooperate in good faith to jointly participate in the organization of the National Government, and both abandon the policies of one-party dictatorship and proletarian revolution, the first step must be to seek to bridge the gap between the two ideologies, which is the bridge of the souls of the two parties. The cooperation between two revolutionary political parties must, at the very least, be premised on having largely similar positions or policies, otherwise it will be a superficial alliance. Moreover, the Kuomintang and the Communist Party have gone through cooperation and then separation, and no one can easily forget the past. Now, if the two sides do not truly seek a common ground for cooperation in ideology and policy, but instead invite "relatives and friends" to negotiate a piecemeal division of property, this fact undoubtedly illustrates that the Kuomintang and the Communist Party have deep-seated prejudices, and cannot trust each other's sincerity, and are therefore more inclined to be realistic.</p>
<p>However, the current situation in China cannot but find a way to break through? The way to break through is to resume negotiations. I am afraid that holding another Political Consultative Conference will still not be up to the task. To put it bluntly, China is still quite far from democracy, and the so-called "public opinion" is still looming. I dare to say that even if universal suffrage is implemented, it will still not escape the influence of various power circles. Therefore, the National Assembly has not yet convened, and the Communist Party is already arguing about how many representatives they should have. I advocate removing all the camouflage and hypocrisy, and having the Kuomintang and the Communist Party step forward in a dignified manner and talk openly and honestly. All people outside the two parties should honestly act as intermediaries and peacemakers; absolutely no partiality is allowed, and being a follower is even more undesirable. Then, the two parties should raise the most fundamental issues, and establish a common path for national construction from the perspectives of their respective ideologies and policies, and from the objective situation of China, so as to be of practical benefit. I dare say that this is the only path that politicians can take now.</p>
<p>II</p>
<p>I advocate removing all camouflage and having the Kuomintang and the Communist Party confront each other head-on to resolve the disputes, entirely based on various historical and international political factors. I feel that this is what should be done in reality, and it must also be done this way.</p>
<p>Taking the word "democracy" as an example, everyone in the country is now calling for democracy, but it seems that the interpretations are different. Since the Northern Expedition of the National Revolutionary Army, China's politics seems to have embarked on the path of the Soviet Union. Now, after more than ten years of "ruling the country by the party" by the Kuomintang, it seems to have become a stereotype, and the Kuomintang wants to change course after this war and take the democratic road of Britain and the United States. Can it be done? It is still in the process of evolution, and the future is uncertain. As for political parties, only the Kuomintang and the Communist Party are not only strong, but also have ideologies that form complete systems, and have considerable history. Other small parties or political groups are still difficult to compete with today. More than a decade ago, I seemed to have outlined three possible paths for China's future destiny in my heart: (1) The Kuomintang eliminates the Communist Party and completes its national construction strategy of the Three Principles of the People; (2) The Communist Party seizes power, implements proletarian dictatorship, and practices Soviet communism; (3) The Kuomintang and the Communist Party, guided by the international environment, treat each other as ordinary political parties, and work together to jointly realize a Principle of People's Livelihood similar to socialism. And today's situation further proves that my previous observations were generally correct. Today's China seems to be facing a crossroads of these three divergent paths and is at a loss. But I now want to take a further step and offer an explanation, that is, due to the evolution of international politics, the first and second paths are no longer possible. Not only will the Chinese people not allow it, but the international community will not allow it either. Therefore, China's future is only one major path, which is the third path, and the Kuomintang has already expressed its willingness to build the country jointly with other parties. In other words, it has abandoned the first path.</p>
<p>There is no need to talk about the past two decades. Let's look at the current international situation. After the end of the war, due to the demise of fascism, it has been confirmed that the attempt by the likes of Hitler to mix the economic form of the Soviet Union with the organization of capitalist society has failed. Thus, two camps have clearly emerged in the world, standing in opposition to each other. The United States and the Soviet Union, representing two different social systems, could cooperate during the war, but after the end of the war, there was no way to avoid each other, and they finally faced each other. After the United States and the Soviet Union faced each other, on the one hand, the Security Council and the Foreign Ministers' Conference held meetings one after another, and on the other hand, there were troublesome facts such as the Iran issue, the Turkey issue, the Balkan issue, the German and Italian issues, the Northeast issue, and the Korean issue. In fact, these many issues are just one issue, that is, the Soviet Union wants to create a "security zone" around its borders, and the United States also wants to obtain security guarantees in the East and West oceans. All issues are nothing more than the reaction of these two "contradictions of securityism." To be fair, the United States does not need to expand its territory, and the Soviet Union does not necessarily want to invade others. Neither of them wants war, but due to the incompatibility of social systems, suspicion seems to be unavoidable. Reflecting this international situation, the China issue is complex when it is said to be complex, and simple when it is said to be simple. Neither the United States nor the Soviet Union will allow either side to create a situation of absolute control over China. And the issue of peace in China also reflects the issue of world peace. I am not saying that the Kuomintang and the Communist Party are using the international background for political struggle. I am only saying that their political struggle is affecting international relations everywhere.</p>
<p>The Chinese revolution that has developed from this international relationship, whether it is the revolution of the Three Principles of the People or the communist revolution, has undergone an internal transformation, that is, the revolutionary strategy of one-party dictatorship is no longer possible in China today. The Kuomintang has already seen this and expressed its intention to abandon its previous "rule the country by the party" approach. At the same time, even if the Communist Party wants to take the opportunity to seize power, it cannot be without scruples. If both the Kuomintang and the Communist Party sincerely abandon the intention of "one-party dictatorship" and no longer take the first or second path, then all problems can be solved easily.</p>
<p>Therefore, the international situation is not pessimistic. On the contrary, it is beneficial to China. At least, it reduces the subjective conditions of incompatibility between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, and provides a common path, which is the path of cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party in accordance with the current international situation.</p>
<p>III</p>
<p>I believe that the real obstacle to the future of Kuomintang-Communist cooperation is not that there is anything absolutely irreconcilable in ideology or policy. Because ideology is not a formula, and policies are more flexible and have room for adjustment. Moreover, the Principle of People's Livelihood of the Three Principles of the People, if it can be thoroughly realized, as Mr. Sun Yat-sen said, is already socialism, and communism is only a type of socialism. According to Mao Zedong's idea, the Chinese revolution should first seek to realize New Democracy, and the Communist Party Manifesto also claims to be willing to fight for the Three Principles of the People. If this is true, then in terms of theory and ideology, we cannot find any reason for the Communist Party not to support the National Government at this time. It can be seen that if cooperation is achieved, the policies of the two parties can be mutually accommodating.</p>
<p>So what exactly is the obstacle to their cooperation? The only thing is suspicion! Since the Kuomintang and the Communist Party split midway during the Northern Expedition, and after several communist riots in Nanchang and Guangzhou, and the long-term encirclement and suppression by the government, the relationship between the two parties has been very bad, and they do not trust each other, and cooperation has been full of hidden reefs. More unfortunately, since the beginning of this political struggle, the ruling Kuomintang has always stood on the side of the government, and cannot help but criticize the Communist Party's actions. The Communist Party, which holds military power, has especially never forgotten to expand its territory as capital for political struggle. The public opinion circles also seem to have such "subjectivity," which sometimes exacerbates the suspicion between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party. Therefore, I deeply feel that the propaganda war between the two sides must not stop, and that the general public does not recognize the essence of the problem, and does not understand the key to the current situation in China. Joining in the middle and making trouble is really giving the future of the country the most terrible impact.</p>
<p>To make the Kuomintang and the Communist Party cooperate sincerely and complete a democratic constitutional country, at least two prerequisite concepts must be affirmed: First, we must recognize that the Communist Party in opposition and the ruling Kuomintang have equal political status; we must recognize that all actions of the Communist Party are also to realize its ideology and implement its policies, and are engaged in political struggle, but the methods it adopts are worthy of consideration. Second, we must recognize that the Chinese revolution has not yet succeeded, and feudal forces, bureaucratic capital, comprador class, and corrupt elements are still active everywhere. The Communist Party's actions are indeed too excessive, and the actions of the Communist troops in various places may even deviate from the original intentions of the Communist Party, but with a forgiving attitude, the Communist Party may not think that it represents the demands of the Chinese common people. It is undeniable that since the Kuomintang came to power, in the past eighteen or nineteen years, except for the fact that it truly led the whole nation to save the country during the Anti-Japanese War, most of its energy has been used to consolidate its regime and party infighting, and sometimes it has even compromised with its previous revolutionary targets. Even at present, politics is quite inefficient. It is forgivable that there is no way to deal with the economy, which can be said to be due to insufficient conditions; but what about the governance of officials? After eight years of the Anti-Japanese War, it may not even be possible to truly achieve a clean government. Therefore, we must recognize that the expansion of the Communist Party is partly due to the external oppression of Japanese imperialism for twenty years, and partly due to the political incompetence of the Kuomintang. We must especially recognize that many outstanding young people who have devoted themselves to Yan'an and have been deceived by the Communist Party are not because they believe in Marxism, nor are they not believe in the Three Principles of the People. They just want revolution, they want to overthrow feudal forces, bureaucratic capital, and all dark phenomena. As long as the Kuomintang is serious about revolution and truly achieves "capable government," why would young people love the Communist Party!</p>
<p>I believe that the people of the Communist Party understand the point that the international situation does not allow the outbreak of revolution more clearly and deeply than we do. Otherwise, they would not need to ask the government for anything, and they could just start a revolution directly. Precisely because the communist revolution is not allowed by facts in China and is indeed unworkable, it fights and then wants to talk with the Kuomintang. The central issue today is nothing more than demanding that the government implement the revolutionary policies of the Three Principles of the People. We must remember: If the government practices revolution, it will not see the expansion of the Communist Party at all; and if it claims to be revolutionary but violates the interests of the people, it will not have a future at all.</p>
<p>The one who tied the bell must untie it. The Kuomintang and the Communist Party must now seek a bridge for cooperation on the revolutionary path. The Kuomintang must liquidate itself and revive the revolutionary spirit of the Guangdong government era; the Communist Party must also liquidate itself, and some excessive styles of killing and arson and the riot policies of Nanchang and Guangzhou must not be repeated. In order to realize the Principle of People's Livelihood, in order to build an equal and free China, in order to overthrow feudal forces and bureaucratic capital, and in order to liberate the Chinese people, there is no reason for them not to get closer and cooperate.</p>
<p>Any problem, just like we calculate complex fractions, must be gradually simplified before it can be solved.</p>
<p>What most people lack for the current problem is a kind of inductive work. The reason why the Political Consultative Conference did not achieve much is because of this. My personal idea is that it is best to let the third party take a step back first, and concentrate the problem on the revolutionary path of the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, as a major premise for resolving the political struggle. As long as the Kuomintang and the Communist Party are still willing to be the promoters of a unified revolutionary policy, and the people of the third party are all honest and fair witnesses, and at the same time maintain equal weights, in this way, the Kuomintang and the Communist Party and all aspects of the country can jointly govern, and their ideologies and policies can be reconciled and implemented by the weights. Then China's politics will have a way out. It is true that there is no way out without revolution, and it is still the country that suffers if the Kuomintang and the Communist Party do not unify the revolutionary path. This is entirely a factual view, and has nothing to do with theory.</p>
<p>If the Kuomintang and the Communist Party can truly cooperate politically and place the struggle on various policies, it is what China urgently needs. Taking the land policy as an example, the Kuomintang can propose a plan to implement equal land rights, and the Communist Party may as well advocate that land be nationalized. Then, the final decision rests with the representatives of the people, which is the realization of democratic politics. Regardless of the people's decision, as long as the Kuomintang and the Communist Party are willing to do so peacefully, I think no one will disagree. Because the Chinese people are not afraid of revolution, they are only afraid of non-revolution, counter-revolution, and fake revolution; but the Chinese people do not want a revolution of riots and bloodshed, they cannot withstand another bloodshed!</p>
<p>We also advocate not to regulate the future form of China's politics and society with a certain stereotype. China will not become Britain and the United States, nor will it become the Soviet Union. China should always be China. The national tradition especially cannot be ignored. What China has demanded since modern times is nutrition, various qualities, not other people's stereotypes. The Chinese politics after the Kuomintang and the Communist Party cooperate should be that the government proposes policies, which are decided by the people, and then implemented by the government, rather than the Soviet government form, or the rigid government form of Britain and the United States. The Kuomintang, the Communist Party, and various other parties can try their best to strive for the realization of their ideas and ideologies in various policies, and the Chinese people will naturally choose what they need. Selling dog meat under the pretense of selling sheep meat cannot be trusted by the Chinese people.</p>
<p>In short, the key to the China problem lies here. Leaving the Chinese revolution problem—which is the only demand of the Chinese masses—leaving the historical and real relationship between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, the disputes cannot be resolved, but will only create more complications.</p>
<p>To make the army nationalized, the Kuomintang and the Communist Party must cooperate sincerely; to make the Kuomintang and the Communist Party cooperate, a unified revolutionary path must be established first.</p>
<p>Special Envoy Marshall, as well as the so-called third parties who participated in the Political Consultative Conference, seem to need to have a full understanding of this last point. Even the responsible persons of the Kuomintang and the Communist Party seem to be very unwilling to touch this fundamental issue. Therefore, I dare to contribute this basic concept to them.</p>

<h3>Whether the Trieste Issue Can Be Compromised Determines the Success or Failure of the Foreign Ministers' Conference—Waiting for New Instructions from Moscow—Two Meetings Held Yesterday Morning and Afternoon</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 24th] The key to the success or failure of the Four Foreign Ministers' Conference lies in today's two gatherings, especially depending on whether a compromise can be reached on the future of the Port of Trieste, which is disputed by Italy and Yugoslavia. The secret informal meeting on Friday afternoon, and the secret exchange of views between Byrnes and Molotov at dinner that night, still do not seem to show any signs of compromise. The issue of Trieste, which is related to the overall situation of the conference, will depend on what new instructions Moscow has at the end of the week, and whether Britain and the United States can make concessions and accept the proposal for international co-management. If Moscow resolutely rejects international co-management, it will be more difficult to reach agreement on the remaining issues on the conference agenda, and it will be even more difficult to obtain the Soviet Union's consent to convene a full-scale peace conference.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Paris, 23rd] The plan to internationalize the Port of Trieste is said to have been proposed by French President and Foreign Minister Bidault at the secret meeting of the four foreign ministers on the 21st of this month. According to this plan, the Port of Trieste will be under the jurisdiction of the United Nations for a period of ten years, after which a referendum will be held to decide whether the port should belong to Italy or Yugoslavia. Judging from unofficial sources, it is not yet clear how the compromise plan will affect the border dispute between Italy and Yugoslavia. In order to speed up the drafting of the peace treaty with Italy, the four foreign ministers have scheduled two meetings this morning and afternoon, with the agenda including the border issues between France and Austria and Italy, and the disposal of Italy's remaining warships. However, observers believe that the Trieste issue will be discussed first.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Rome, 24th] Italian Prime Minister Gasperi announced today in a document: "Italy will do its best to resist any peaceful solution that would subject the Port of Trieste to international co-management and cede the western part of the Istria region to Yugoslavia." "This solution is unfair. Although we are weak and unarmed, we will never tolerate the destruction of our rights."</p>
<h3>US and Soviet Union to Engage in Heated Debate at Atomic Energy Commission</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 24th] Tomorrow's debate at the United Nations Atomic Energy Commission may damage the optimistic atmosphere that has emerged after a week of meetings at the Paris Four Foreign Ministers' Conference. At the beginning of the establishment of the Security Council, it was informed that the resolutions in the meeting could reflect the basic relationship between the powers. Now, the resolutions of the Atomic Energy Commission obviously also have a significant impact on the Foreign Ministers' Conference. This can be seen from the fundamental differences between the plans proposed by the US and Soviet representatives to the Atomic Energy Commission. It is expected that the United States will not be willing to immediately destroy atomic bombs or disclose their secrets before obtaining the firm guarantees mentioned in its plan, and Soviet representative Gromyko may not intend to accept this guarantee. Tomorrow's debate will inevitably bring the US and Soviet plans to a conflict situation.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, London, 23rd] The British United Nations Association held its general assembly today and voted by a large majority against the US proposal for an international management of atomic energy plan and in favor of the Soviet proposal.</p>
<h3>South Africa Discriminates Against Indian Overseas Chinese—India Files Complaint with the United Nations</h3>
<p>[Reuters, New York, 23rd] Mudaliar, the chief representative of the Indian mission to the United Nations, recently submitted a complaint to United Nations Secretary-General Lie on India's protest against the discrimination by the South African federal authorities against the 250,000 Indian residents of that country, asking him to submit it to the plenary session on September 2. India has previously announced the severance of trade relations with South Africa and recalled its High Commissioner. Mudaliar also said that the current situation is becoming increasingly serious and is sufficient to damage the relations between the two countries.</p>
<h3>Argentine Ambassador to France Meets with Molotov</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 24th] Moscow Radio recently announced that Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov met with the Argentine Ambassador to France yesterday. Afterwards, the Argentine Ambassador told people that the meeting lasted for half an hour and the atmosphere was extremely sincere.</p>
<h3>Soviet Consul General Suddenly Leaves Seoul</h3>
<p>Hodge Says Matter is Inexplicable [Agence France-Presse, New York, 23rd] A local radio station said that the Soviet Consul General in Seoul and his staff have returned to the Soviet-occupied area. According to Hodge, Commander-in-Chief of the US Forces in South Korea, the sudden departure of the Soviet Consul General was not only unexpected, but also difficult to explain.</p>
<h3>Clashes Break Out Again Between French and Vietnamese Military Police</h3>
<p>Hanoi Falls into State of War</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Hanoi, 22nd] After Hoang Thuc Khang, Acting President of the Vietnamese government, issued a document advising the people to maintain stability in the face of the daily clashes between the French and Vietnamese and not to allow any provocative behavior, the situation in Hanoi was only stable for twelve hours. Clashes broke out again between the French and Vietnamese at six locations last night. Within three hours from 9 pm to 12 am, the entire city of Hanoi fell into a state of war, with machine guns as dense as a string of pearls, and mixed with steel artillery grenades. All traffic in the urban area was cut off. After mediation by the French-Vietnamese Liaison Office, the clashes stopped.</p>
<h3>Far East International Tribunal: Former Yomiuri Editor Testifies, Says There Was No Freedom of Speech in Japan Before the War</h3>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 24th] Suzuki Kyo, former chief editor of the Yomiuri Shimbun, testified before the International Tribunal today, stating: Japan not only implemented a strict censorship system before the war, but the press departments of the Army, Navy, and Foreign Ministry also convened chief editors of various newspapers on a regular basis to inform them of the content to be written. From 1935 until the end of the Pacific War, Japanese newspapers and periodicals were entirely under the government's control and domination. During this period, there was not a single newspaper in Japan that resembled a free one. The prosecution then presented Japanese photographs as evidence, with the photos showing American warships as part of Japan's evidence of preparedness for war. A newly opened film producer claimed that the Japanese government approved 306 Japanese films in 1940, of which 110 were on the theme of militarism, and the propaganda films were produced under the instruction of the government.</p>
<h3>Egypt Plans to Establish Diplomatic Relations with the Vatican</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 23rd] Vatican Radio broadcast: An Arab delegation has arrived in Rome, preparing to meet with the Pope, asking him to pay attention to the Palestinian issue. According to a report from Cairo: The Egyptian government continues to establish diplomatic relations with the Vatican. It is also learned that Lebanon is about to appoint a representative to the Vatican. The Vatican has recently recognized Lebanon, and the Lebanese government has proposed the establishment of guarantees to protect Catholics and the establishment of diplomatic relations with the Vatican.</p>
<h3>French Coalition Cabinet Formed: Premier Bidault Concurrently Serves as Foreign Minister, Seats Held by the Three Major Parties are Roughly Equal</h3>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 24th] President Bidault formed a new coalition government of three parties early this morning, concurrently serving as Foreign Minister. The cabinet members are largely the same as the previous cabinet. The seats held by the three major parties are roughly equal. Former President Gouin, leader of the Socialist Party, and Thorez, leader of the Communist Party, are designated as Vice Presidents. Previously, the French General Confederation of Labor (CGT) demanded a 25% wage increase. Bidault agreed to a 15% increase, which was agreed to by the Communist Party, and the obstacle to the formation of the new government was eliminated.</p>
<p>Cabinet Member List:</p>
<p>Premier and Foreign Minister: Bidault (Popular Republican Movement), Associates: Gouin (Socialist Party), Thorez (Communist Party), Minister of Justice: Teitgen (Popular Republican Movement), Minister of Interior: Tixier (Socialist Party), Minister of Military Affairs: Michelet (Popular Republican Movement), Minister of Armaments: Billoux (Communist Party), Minister of Finance: Schuman (Popular Republican Movement), Minister of Education: Naegelen (Socialist Party), Minister of Transportation: Moch (Socialist Party), Minister of Labor: Croizat (Communist Party), Minister of Colonies: Moutet (Communist Party), Minister of Industrial Production: Paul (Communist Party), Minister of People's Affairs: Prigent (Popular Republican Movement), Minister of Health: Hyacinthe (Communist Party), Minister of Economy: Mansan (Popular Republican Movement), Minister of Agriculture: Tanguy-Prigent (Socialist Party), Minister of Information: Guet (Popular Republican Movement),  Forneret (Leftist Union Party), Cabinet Secretary: Colin (Popular Republican Movement).</p>

<h3>Shia Islamic Leader to Visit Iran</h3>
<p>[United Press, Meshed, Iran, 23rd] Ayatollah Sayyed Hossein Borujerdi, the spiritual leader of five million Shia Muslims, will arrive here within half a month to discuss future Iranian general elections. Observers believe that these Shia Muslims have prevented a revolutionary movement similar to Azerbaijan's here and oppose the land redistribution plan of the leftist "Tudeh" Party.</p>
<h3>UN Security Council Meets to Debate the Spanish Question</h3>
<p>Polish Proposal Will Undoubtedly Be Vetoed</p>
<p>[United Press, New York, 24th] The United Nations Security Council is scheduled to meet today to put to a vote the Polish proposal calling for the entire world to sever relations with the Franco government. Representatives from various countries have prepared to attend the discussion. Judging from their expressions, Poland will get at most four votes out of eleven, and the proposal will be rejected. However, it is heard that Polish Representative Lange intends to take two actions: to keep the Spanish case on the agenda of the Security Council and to prevent it from being submitted to the United Nations General Assembly in September.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 23rd] Former Undersecretary of State Welles said here today in a broadcast that the Security Council's debate on the Spanish issue is actually a struggle for a foothold between the Soviet Union and Britain, and even between the Soviet Union and Western countries. If the Franco government is overthrown, Spain is likely to have a civil war, and a Communist-dominated government will seize control. If that happens, Spain is likely to be split, and Britain's transportation to military installations at the Suez Canal and throughout the Mediterranean may be cut off. In addition, the Communist forces in France, Italy, and North Africa will receive direct assistance from the new Spanish government and will be greatly strengthened.</p>
<h3>Indian Congress Party Executive Committee Rejects British Proposal; British Representatives Still Trying to Salvage, to Avoid a Breakdown in Negotiations</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper's Report] London, 24th, broadcast: The Executive Committee of the Indian National Congress has rejected the British proposal regarding the Indian interim government.</p>
<p>[United Press, New Delhi, 24th] News today: Because the British Cabinet Mission's plan to establish an Indian interim government is bound to be rejected by the Congress Party, it has put forward a new, last-minute proposal to avoid a breakdown in negotiations. It is reported that British representatives Lawrence and Cripps met with Congress Party representatives Gandhi and Patel for an hour to discuss this new proposal. After the meeting, Gandhi rushed to the Congress Party Executive Committee to attend the morning meeting. It was previously reported that the committee was ready to pass a resolution rejecting the British plan, but after the two-and-a-half-hour meeting ended, no expected resolution was announced, causing outside speculation that the committee may have reached an agreement on the form of the Indian interim government. After the meeting, Congress Party President Acharya Kripalani told reporters, "There are some new developments today, and perhaps the situation is hopeful?" Acharya laughed and replied, "One can draw one's own conclusions." It is noted that Acharya was clearly pessimistic about the future of the negotiations yesterday.</p>
<p>Gandhi and Acharya Issue Separate Declarations</p>
<p>[United Press, New Delhi, 23rd] Indian National Congress President Acharya Kripalani and Indian spiritual leader Gandhi issued separate declarations tonight, stating that they reject the British proposal to form an interim government. Acharya's declaration was issued three hours after the Congress Party Executive Committee meeting. It is said that "as far as the Congress Party is concerned, this matter is now over." Gandhi said in a speech at an evening meeting, "We should not expect the British Cabinet Mission, but should form our own cabinet mission to exert its leadership and power. We cannot build freedom in haste, nor can we obtain it in haste. We must persevere and move forward." Congress Party President Nehru had a 90-minute meeting with Indian Governor-General Wavell and the British Cabinet Mission. Gandhi also attended the committee meeting.</p>
<h3>Another Mass Grave Discovered in Germany</h3>
<p>[United Press, Berlin, 23rd] According to a Red Army newspaper report: Another mass grave has been discovered at the site of a former prisoner-of-war camp in Zossen, Saxony, Germany, containing the bodies of 100,000 prisoners of war, mostly Russians. According to the investigation: The prisoners died from overwork, lack of food, and infectious diseases. The so-called prisoner-of-war hospital once housed 50,000 patients, who were unattended. The only way out was the mass grave.</p>
<h3>Radioactive Isotopes Can Be Used to Explore the Source of Diseases</h3>
<p>Another Use of Atomic Energy</p>
<p>[United States Information Service, Washington, 23rd] Since the War Department recently announced that radio isotopes can be used for research in biology and medicine, the results of wartime atomic research may soon be used for the first time in peacetime. These isotopes will be used for research in basic and applied sciences, especially in biology and medicine. These beneficial radio isotopes will come from the "atomic pile" at the Oak Ridge Laboratory in Tennessee and will be distributed throughout the United States for scientific applications. The benefits that isotopes can produce in medicine, at least initially, are not direct treatment, but as a tool for exploring the source of diseases. Under the currently announced plan, about 100 types of isotopes with different capacities and radioactivity will be available.</p>
<h3>Eisenhower Releases Historic Report: Analyzes Allied War Achievements in Europe: Three Major Battles Determined the Fate of the German Army; British and American Strength More Than Double That of the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 23rd] Army Chief of Staff Eisenhower today submitted a 123-page long report to the Joint Chiefs of Staff, describing his command of the troops from Normandy to the Elbe River during his tenure as Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces in Europe. The report stated that the victory in the European War was determined by three major battles. This was due to the strength and cooperation of the United Nations and the mistakes of Germany. The war was won before crossing the Rhine. Hitler and Rundstedt miscalculated the date of the Allied landing and concentrated their main force to deal with Britain, waiting for a second attack that would never come. The enemy's strategy of stubbornly defending its self-selected positions to meet the enemy therefore fell into our trap. In the eleven months from D-Day to Victory Day, the three major battles were as follows:</p>
<p>Normandy Landing Battle: The enemy was trapped there due to inconvenience in supply and transportation, and the destruction of the transportation lines became its fatal blow. The enemy, due to weak air power and lack of reconnaissance, was completely misled by our feint strategy and failed to mobilize the troops in the Calais area until it was too late to regret it. If these troops had crossed the Seine River and attacked the beaches at the beginning of our landing, the overall situation might have been unfavorable to us.</p>
<p>Battle of the Falaise Pocket: At that time, from the perspective of military logic, the enemy should have made a strategic retreat, but the enemy did not do so and wanted to defend to the end, thus allowing the Seventh Army to be surrounded and smashed to pieces. The battle for France was decided in the bloody hedgerows of Normandy.</p>
<p>Rhine West Bank Battle: In February and March 1945, the enemy forces there originally wanted to defend Germany, but they were defeated to the point of collapse. In short, from the perspective of the entire war, Germany's failure to fully sustain the supply of its troops was its fatal injury. The enemy's morale was indeed very strong, but morale alone was not enough to save the situation. Regarding this point, we are most grateful for the mission of the United Nations Air Force. In terms of the strength of the United Nations, on the eve of crossing the Rhine, the troops under my command numbered nearly four million, plus nearly 11,000 fighters and bombers, and the British and American navies were united into one, with unparalleled strength. Behind the combat troops, there were 3 million uniformed male and female auxiliary members.</p>
<p>Full of Cooperative Spirit: The cooperation between Britain and the United States was not only based on the spirit of the United Nations, but was even like one country, jointly pouring in its resources, manpower, and materials. The Soviet Union was more difficult. Until the end of 1944, I did not receive a report on the Soviet strategy... But in January of the following year, I learned from Marshal Stalin the detailed plan of the Soviet Union's four-way offensive, using 150 to 160 divisions. The victory was greater than expected. At the end of the European War, the General Headquarters had 90 divisions under its jurisdiction, most of which were jointly operated by tanks, anti-aircraft guns, and other subordinate units. When Germany surrendered, I had a total of 90 divisions, each division with about 17,000 men, more than twice the strength of the Soviet divisions.</p>
<h3>Foreign Ministers' Conference Fraught with Obstacles: The Full Picture of the Dispute Between Italy and Yugoslavia</h3>
<p>The Question of Sovereignty Over Trieste is the Focus of the Dispute</p>
<p>Since the first Four Power Foreign Ministers' Conference in 1945, the issue of the Italian Peace Treaty has remained a sticking point and has not been fully resolved. The current Four Power Foreign Ministers' Conference in Paris is studying how to reach an agreement. This article, translated from "Foreign Policy Bulletin," is a special account of the border issue between Italy and Yugoslavia, and summarizes the opinions of both sides, which is very important reference material.</p>
<p>At the Potsdam Conference in July 1945, the three powers agreed to establish a Council of Foreign Ministers, which would meet in London "to draft peace treaties with Italy, Romania, Bulgaria, Finland, etc., and to provide solutions to major territorial issues at the end of the European war." The agreement specifically emphasized that "the preparation of the Italian Peace Treaty is an important task that the new council should immediately undertake." The Foreign Ministers' Conference began in September 1945. After several consultations, it finally broke down without fulfilling its mission. In December of the same year, the three foreign ministers decided at a meeting in Moscow to authorize their deputies to immediately resume work in London in order to draft a treaty for submission to the peace conference scheduled for May 1, 1946. Although the deadline has passed, no progress has been made in reconciling the differences on the Italian Peace Treaty. The differences between the three powers mostly occurred in the issues of reparations, the disposition of Italian colonies, and the re-drawing of Italy's new borders. Regarding the very complex Italian-Yugoslav border dispute, the London Conference had an agreement, which stated: "The demarcation line should mainly be determined based on consideration of ethnicity, and regardless of sovereignty, Trieste should be an internationally administered free port." Although this agreement provided a formula for coordination, the heart of the problem had not been touched. Italy and Yugoslavia have great differences regarding "consideration of ethnicity." Therefore, this statement needs to be defined fairly and accurately. At that time, both countries had demands on sovereignty, and the term "sovereignty" also needs to be clearly defined. When the Foreign Ministers' Deputy Conference discussed this issue again in January 1946, it decided to send a special committee to Trieste to study the territorial claims disputed by all parties and make concrete recommendations before the peace conference. However, it is doubtful whether the committee can break through the difficulties for the solution of the problem. Therefore, people cannot help but think that the three powers made this resolution simply to delay the day when the problem must be solved.</p>
<p>If the issue of the Italian Peace Treaty could truly set aside all disputes, and there were no factors of competing for hegemony in Eastern Europe and the Eastern Mediterranean, the solution would definitely be easier and faster. Although European problems can be dealt with one by one, they all have inseparable connections. The solution to the Italian problem is obviously related to the new balance of power formed during the war. The most basic point is: who can share the sphere of influence in the Mediterranean and the Adriatic Sea, and how should the main interests be distributed? From this point of view, the trust requests of Tripolitania and Eritrea, the future of the Greek and Dodecanese Islands, Italian reparations, and the new Italian-Yugoslav border are all intertwined. The focus of the border dispute is Trieste. The port of Trieste is located at the top of the Adriatic Sea, on the west coast of the Istrian Peninsula. However, the disputed area includes the area related to the different borders before and after the war. This area is called "Venezia Giulia" by the Italians. This area is 3,500 square miles and has a population of about one million. According to Italian estimates: 600,000 are Yugoslavs and 400,000 are Italians. According to Southern estimates: 650,000 are Yugoslavs and 250,000 are Italians.</p>
<p>Conflicting Demands from Both Sides</p>
<p>In the past two years, the situation has changed drastically, and Yugoslavia and Italy have been constantly arguing over the Venezia Giulia issue. Both sides hold their own views and are deadlocked. However, their opinions can be roughly divided as follows:</p>
<p>Yugoslavian Demands: These were described in detail in a memorandum submitted by Deputy Prime Minister Kardelj at the Foreign Ministers' Conference in September 1945. The memorandum requested that the border between Yugoslavia and Italy be extended westward, starting from the city of Monfalcone on the Adriatic coast and extending northward to the confluence of the Vipava and Isonzo rivers, and then extending north along the Isonzo River for a short section, and then northwest along the Tsintau road to the end point of the Italian border as the new national border. If Yugoslavia's request is realized, Italy's situation will not be as good as when it bordered Austria in 1914, and Yugoslavia will absorb 350,000 to 400,000 Italians. The reasons cited in the Yugoslav memorandum and various formal and informal supplementary talks can be summarized as follows: (1) In terms of population, the area requested by Yugoslavia is mostly Slovenian in the south and mostly Croatian in the north. Therefore, the combined population of Slovenians and Croatians accounts for the majority of the population in the area, and Slavs are the national group of Yugoslavia, accounting for the largest number of people. Generally speaking, Yugoslavia's request is largely correct, but the Southern side also said that the statistics include the figures made by Austria in 1910, which do not accurately reflect the current situation. They pointed out that the survey method of determining ethnic relations based on the language spoken has made the Italian population larger than the actual figure. They estimate that the total population of the area is 970,000, and Yugoslavs account for no less than 650,000. (2) As for the port of Trieste, the Southern side believes that the city "is entirely dependent on its interior, but the interior is not Italian but Yugoslavian. Although it is generally recognized that most of the population of Trieste is called Italian, the population is obviously very mixed. Since the entire port is surrounded by Slavic suburbs, its Slavic component is increasing, and the Italians in Trieste mostly supported the Liberation Army's movement during the war, which is enough to show their desire to follow Yugoslavia. In any case, Yugoslavia is determined to make Trieste an autonomous state within the Yugoslav Federation, with the same rights as other autonomous units. Therefore, the Italians will still have their own government, and their national rights will be guaranteed. In addition, the economic prosperity of Trieste can only be realized when it becomes part of Yugoslavia. There are many precedents for international co-management of commercial ports. International co-management of Trieste is by no means a solution to the problem." (3) Yugoslavia is a loyal ally of the victorious countries and has its own rights as a victor to this land.</p>
<p>Italian Demands: These are far less clear than Yugoslavia's. According to the memorandum submitted by Italian Foreign Minister Gasperi to the Foreign Ministers' Conference, the Italian government is clearly adopting a consultative approach. It stated that in order to unite and reconstruct Europe, and especially to establish friendly relations between Italy and Yugoslavia, it is willing to make sacrifices. It recognized that Italy was guilty of fighting Yugoslavia, but it also pointed out that the Italian people did not want this war. Gasperi said: Regarding the border dispute, Italy is willing to accept international mediation, but hopes that the solution can be accepted by the "democratic government." He explained the solution that the Italian people considered fair, that is, the "Wilson Line" is generally reasonable. According to the "Wilson Line," Trieste should be left to Italy. Italy hopes to reach an agreement with other countries that intend to use the port, requesting that the port and suburbs not be disconnected, that it not lose railway links with Pola, and that Fiume be restored to its "isolated part." The Italians in the southern border should be properly protected, and Southern Italy should simultaneously disarm on the nearby coast. He specifically called for the rights to the Arsa coal mine, which supplies 30% of Italy's total coal production, and the bauxite mine necessary for the Italian aluminum industry. He pointed out that Italy is already an exporter of these two materials. The reasons for Italy's demands are: First, although Italy made mistakes during the fascist regime, it was loyal to the United Nations during the final victory period and made its important contributions. Therefore, it should not be treated as a defeated country. On the contrary, it should be regarded as a cooperating ally. Naturally, this is a judicial argument, which the Allied forces would never have considered during Italy's participation in the Axis powers. Second, depriving the Italian nation of hundreds of thousands of people, especially depriving it of sovereignty over Trieste, will cause resentment among the Italian people, thus making the "democratic government" unrealizable and making future relations between Southern Italy very disharmonious. In short, although Yugoslavia says that its claim is the consensus of the people in the area, it does not propose holding a plebiscite. A plebiscite may provide a real answer to the problem, but whether it can be held is a big question. (US Information Office)</p>
<h3>Imminent Atomic Bomb Test: Final Bombing Practice Conducted Yesterday; Test Costs Not Expected to Exceed $500 Million</h3>
<p>[United Press Bikini Atoll B-29 Type Aircraft 24th Dispatch] The atomic bomb test is about to take place. Test personnel, including Major Swinkerd, conducted the final test flight today, dropping a practice bomb on the target ship Nevada with considerable accuracy. In the previous four test flights, practice bombs were dropped within 500 feet of the target. However, today, Vice Admiral White, in charge of the atomic bomb test, ordered the bomb to be dropped from an altitude of 600 feet. When Major Swinkerd's aircraft, "Tuff's Dream," took off from Kwajalein Island, an army air force captain accidentally touched the rapidly spinning propeller and died instantly.</p>
<p>[United Press Bikini Coral Island 23rd Dispatch] The final test flight of the B-29 aircraft carrying the atomic bomb, originally scheduled for the 22nd, was postponed to the 24th due to adverse weather conditions.</p>
<p>[Further Dispatch] The U.S. Navy Department yesterday defended the cost of the atomic bomb test, denying that the expenditures would exceed $500 million. Even if the test costs included most ships, personnel, supplies, and other factors, similar to the scale of wartime forces, this figure would not be reached. Navy Lieutenant Commander Cholin stated: The cost estimate will not be released until Test Commander Blandy submits the final report, but the gross amount will be lower than the construction cost of an "Iowa" class battleship, approximately $110 million. The lessons learned from this test will save countless lives, ships, and money in the future. The claim that the target ships are worth $400 million is also difficult to accept. This is an estimate of the total construction cost, but most of these warships are now worthless. If sold for scrap, the seventy-seven target ships would only be worth $5.5 million.</p>
<h3>New Type V2 Rocket Can Reach 100 Miles High</h3>
<p>Scheduled for Test Launch on the 27th of this Month</p>
<p>[United States Information Service Washington 23rd Dispatch] On June 27th, the U.S. Army Ordnance Department will set an altitude record when launching the sixth V2 rocket at the White Sands Proving Ground in New Mexico. Joint research personnel from the Army and Navy will observe this rocket, filled with experimental recording instruments, penetrate the ionosphere. It is expected that the rocket will reach an altitude of 100 miles, a high-altitude area known only through observations of sunlight, auroras, meteorites, and radio wave reflections.</p>
<h3>Earthquake on the West Coast of the United States</h3>
<p>[United Press Seattle 24th Dispatch] An earthquake occurred in the Pacific Ocean today, affecting areas from northwestern Washington to southern Vancouver Island and Kelowna Island in British Columbia. Many house walls collapsed, and some residents died from heart attacks as a result. According to records on the seismograph at the University of Washington, the first earthquake occurred at 9:14 AM. The eastern coast of Vancouver Island suffered the most damage. Witnesses in Courtenay reported that giant waves of seawater invaded the land.</p>
<h3>The Bullet That Killed the Former King of Siam Entered From the Front</h3>
<p>Results of Coffin Examination</p>
<p>[United Press Bangkok 21st Dispatch] (Delayed) Official announcement: The body of the late King Ananda Mahidol has been exhumed, examined, and X-rayed, proving that the fatal bullet entered from the front, contrary to rumors that it entered from the back. The examination was conducted due to rumors that the King was assassinated.</p>
<h3>To Cope With Modern Warfare, the United States Needs to Maintain Strong Strength and Establish an Intelligence Military Academy to Cultivate Talent Early On</h3>
<p>[Reuters London 23rd Dispatch] New York radio reports: General Eisenhower, Commander-in-Chief of the U.S. Army, recently gave a speech stating that to save the United States in future wars, it is necessary to have a very large defense force that can be deployed immediately. If the United States can maintain a strong military position, it can prevent the threat of retaliatory aggression from enemies. In future wars, the U.S. military will need to penetrate deep into the enemy's heartland, defeat its troops, and seize its military equipment before it can stop its rocket attacks and bombing. Therefore, the United States needs to maintain its strength at all times.</p>
<p>[United Press Washington 23rd Dispatch] Secretary of the Navy Forrestal announced today that a well-organized and well-trained intelligence agency can determine the outcome of a war. To implement the strategy of "know yourself and know your enemy," the Navy Department will establish an intelligence officers' school on July 1st to cultivate talent.</p>

<h3>Relief for Refugees in Northern Jiangsu: Fundraising of 5 Million Yuan; Fundraising Committee Established Yesterday</h3>
<p>Minister Gu and Chairman Wang Report on Inspection of Disaster Situation in Northern Jiangsu</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] More than 3 million refugees in Northern Jiangsu are suffering under the devastation and oppression of the Communists, fleeing to other places. More than 50,000 refugees have arrived in Shanghai in recent days. Wu Zhihui, Du Yuesheng, Rong Desheng, Chen Guangfu, Qian Xinzhi, Leng Tong, Niu Tiansheng, and others have initiated the organization of the Shanghai Fundraising Committee of the Northern Jiangsu Refugee Relief Association. Yesterday at 4 PM, the establishment meeting was held at the Broadway Mansions, attended by more than 200 people from all walks of life. Wu Zhihui served as chairman and delivered the opening speech. Leng Tong then delivered a speech, stating briefly: Relieving the refugees in Northern Jiangsu is a matter for all people in Jiangsu Province, requiring a large force to solve. An appeal was made to the government, and Minister Gu Zhenggang of the Ministry of Social Affairs and Chairman Wang Maogong of Jiangsu Province were invited by the Central Government to inspect various places, which was deeply inspiring. However, the government's financial resources are limited, and Shanghai's economic situation is better than other places. With the fundraising planned by Mr. Du Yuesheng and others, it is believed that the compatriots in Shanghai can take on the task of disaster relief.</p>
<p>Minister Gu then reported on the inspection, saying that his mind was filled with sadness and anger when inspecting various places. He was very pleased to receive enthusiastic assistance from all walks of life. Chairman Chiang is extremely concerned and sympathetic to the refugees in Northern Jiangsu, and sent him to pay attention to relief. With the assistance of local gentry, the work has made considerable progress in a short period of time. The relief principles are divided into three stages: (1) To cooperate fully and unify the government and social forces. (2) To treat both the symptoms and the root cause, providing relief and restoring production. (3) To be practical and rapid, ensuring that all relief materials are used on the refugees and processed as soon as possible, as disaster relief is like putting out a fire. Regarding the organization, the Northern Jiangsu Refugee Relief Association was established under the principle of full cooperation to determine relief policies and material distribution. Offices were established in Xuzhou, Yangzhou, Haizhou, Nantong, and Taizhou to cooperate with local organizations to carry out work. Regarding relief work, refugee reception centers, refugee canteens, hospitals, clinics, medical teams, small loans, and job introductions are being organized. In addition to the portion issued by the Central Government, materials and donations are being solicited from society. A finance committee will be established to manage the custody and audit of these items.</p>
<p>Any relief worker who engages in corruption should be publicly reported, and the whistleblower can receive a reward of 30,000 to 300,000 yuan. If a refugee impersonates someone and is reported, the whistleblower can receive a reward of 10,000 to 50,000 yuan. The Central Government has allocated 1 billion yuan for relief facilities and 5,000 tons of flour, approximately 230,000 bags, including 69,000 tons for Xuzhou, 36,000 tons each for Yangzhou, Haizhou, and Yinzhou, 500 tons each for Nantong and Taizhou, and the remainder distributed to other places. Hygiene and medical equipment have also been expanded, and epidemic prevention and infectious disease hospitals have been established. It is estimated that there are approximately 3 million refugees displaced by the disaster in the counties of Northern Jiangsu, and 1.02 million people have been registered. They were all driven out by the Communist Party's "three-capital struggle." It is hoped that the compatriots in this city will contribute money, grain, and housing. The fundraising target is set at 2 billion to 5 billion yuan. The disaster in Northern Jiangsu is neither a natural disaster nor a national crisis, but a man-made disaster caused by the Communist Party, so we must not sit idly by.</p>
<p>Chairman Wang then delivered a speech, first thanking the compatriots in Jiangsu on behalf of the refugees in Northern Jiangsu, and said that the refugees in Northern Jiangsu are starving everywhere. We must shout loudly to send the refugees home as soon as possible; to save the youth, not to let them fall into the hands of bandits; and to let the Communist Party know that the people of Jiangsu are not easy to bully, and not to let them achieve the goal of social instability and people having no food to eat. The Political Department of the Military Affairs Commission has taken in 10,000 refugee youths, and the Ministry of Education has taken in 3,500. It is hoped that the compatriots in Shanghai will donate generously, not only providing material relief but also spiritual assistance.</p>
<p>Then, Qi Boxi, a representative of the refugees in Northern Jiangsu, reported on the disaster, tearfully. Those present were moved to tears. In addition to requesting relief for clothing, food, and housing, he also requested Minister Gu and Chairman Wang to forward a request to Chairman Chiang to "return home." Shortly after the report, more than 100 displaced youths gathered outside the door to petition. After Minister Gu and Chairman Wang personally comforted them, they retreated, shouting slogans in support of the Central Government.</p>
<p>At the end of the meeting, Wu Kaixian reported on the association's affairs and announced the list of responsible persons. After passing, the meeting adjourned. The director of the preparatory committee of the association is Du Yuesheng, the deputy director is Wu Kaiguang, there are 25 standing committee members, and the fundraising group is divided into the financial sector: Captain Chen Guangfu, Deputy Captains Bei Yizhi and Zhao Dihua. Industrial sector: Rong Desheng, Yang Guanbei, Xi Yushu. Business sector: Du Yuesheng, Wang Zhixin, Wang Liangzhong. Women's sector: Qian Jianqiu, Su Xiang, Tian Shujun. Labor sector: Lu Jingshi, Lu Yinchu, Chen Peide. Performing arts sector: Tang Zhuanzhi, Zhao Peixin, Wang Qijun. Sports events: Gu Jiatang, E Sen, Tang Shichang. General fundraising: Wu Shaoshu, Wang Zhuyi, Li Wenjie. The general secretary is Wang Xianqing.</p>
<h3>Relief Subcommittee for Northern Jiangsu: Tea Party to Welcome Gu and Wang</h3>
<p>Earnestly Requesting Prompt Implementation of Relief</p>
<p>The Shanghai Branch of the Northern Jiangsu Refugee Relief Association and the Shanghai Temporary Relief Committee for Refugees from Northern Jiangsu held a tea party at the New Life Club yesterday to report on and request relief matters, welcoming Minister Gu Zhenggang and Chairman Wang Maogong. More than 30 people including Ge Kexin and Wang Zhuyi attended. First, Zhu Hua, director of the Jiangbei Service Agency, reported on the process of registering refugees and earnestly requested the prompt implementation of relief. Then, Minister Gu delivered a speech, stating briefly that he was ordered to inspect Northern Jiangsu, and the victims in various places were crying bitterly because national disasters should be endured, and natural disasters should be endured, but this man-made disaster should not be endured, so they cried. Under these serious circumstances, after consultation, a sound organization was established based on the principles of unified cooperation and treatment of both symptoms and root causes to complete the relief work. Finally, various attendees delivered speeches and the meeting adjourned.</p>

<h3>Difficult to Put Out Due to Strong Winds: Fire at the Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury; Cheng Ami Dies in the Fire, Three Missing; Fire at Guangyi Engraving Company Causes Major Disaster</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] Yesterday afternoon, while Shanghai was being hit by a fierce gale, the largest fire since the victory occurred in Shanghai.</p>
<p>At 1:40 PM, a fire suddenly broke out on the third floor of the Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury building at 17 and 19 Avenue Edward VII. At that time, there was a strong wind. In fifteen minutes, the flames on the third floor had spread from west to east, becoming a sea of fire!</p>
<p>Wang Ying, a reporter for the Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury, had just finished eating and was resting on the third floor. He did not know that he was surrounded by flames on three sides. He only heard a clamor of voices below. He quickly looked out the window and realized that a fire had broken out. The corridor on the third floor was full of thick smoke. Below, several workers from the Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury were holding a truck tarp open, as if preparing for someone to jump, but this was only a precaution. Jumping from the third floor was quite dangerous. However, he first dropped a box and then jumped down!</p>
<p>The street was already full of onlookers, many of whom were employees of the Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury. Watching him jump, everyone couldn't help but close their eyes - but Mr. Wang Ying was lucky and landed safely without any injuries!</p>
<p>Cheng Rongming, a typesetter at the Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury, rushed to his room on the third floor as soon as he heard that there was a fire on the third floor. He desperately dragged out his wife, but he couldn't rescue his three-year-old son, Cheng Ami, and watched him die in the fire.</p>
<p>As of 10 PM last night, those still missing included Ms. Pu Cai, a 53-year-old woman who was bedridden with mental illness, and her seven-year-old granddaughter, Pu Pinfang. Cheng Xiangsheng, the five-year-old son of Mr. Cheng of the distribution department of the Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury, is also still missing and his whereabouts are unknown.</p>
<p>The second floor of the newspaper building was full of water stains, but the machines and paper of the Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury were not damaged. Not only that, the Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury was still published as usual yesterday, with the news of the newspaper building fire as the headline!</p>
<p>The editorial department of the Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury was on the ground floor, and all documents and typewriters were intact. However, many reference materials piled up on the third floor were completely destroyed.</p>
<p>The owner of this building is Mr. Morris, the owner of the North-China Daily News. The building is quite old and is one of the oldest buildings in Shanghai. At one time, a very luxurious casino was opened there. The Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury moved in in 1929. There were many tenants on the third floor. Those burned down yesterday included the Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury Radio Station, the New York Times office, Guangyi Engraving Company, and some dormitories for Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury employees. Zheng Zhaoji, general manager of the Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury Radio Station, and manager Wang Yanxun said that broadcasting could be restored within ten days.</p>
<p>The fire burned for two hours. By evening, Pan Zhichong and Wang Changyuan, detectives from the Huangpu Branch, had determined that the fire started at Guangyi Engraving Company.</p>
<p>The Henan Road Fire Brigade was the first to arrive yesterday, but was unable to put out the fire due to the strong winds. Later, almost all of the city's fire brigades were dispatched, and as many as twelve fire engines arrived one after another. U.S. military firefighters and military police also arrived, and finally put out the catastrophe in the strong winds. Renji Hospital received a soap box in the evening, with the small body of Cheng Ami lying in the box.</p>

<h3>Zhang Xiao Still Determined to Resign; District Chief of the 32nd District Replaced</h3>

<p>[Our Newspaper Report] The grain loan fraud case was re-investigated by Prosecutor Wu Qihua in the morning, and grain merchants were summoned.

The court adjourned at 11:40 AM, ordering Feng Zhongsheng of Xiedaheng Rice Shop, Wang Yuzhen of Huifeng Company, and Yu Liangji of Qianchangyu Rice Shop to each provide 10 million yuan in written bail. The remaining grain merchants of Tongyi Company and others were all ordered to return. However, Chuan Changyu of Tongcheng Gold Company was suspected of using grain loan funds to purchase a large number of pencils and was required to provide another 10 million yuan in written bail. The account books and other items of each grain merchant were all filed for future reference. Wang Daren, Ren Xingya, Shao Jigao, and others in custody were not questioned because the case files could not be sorted in time.</p>
<p>[Further News] A reporter met with Director Zeng of the Garrison Command Military Law Office again yesterday afternoon to inquire whether Wang Daren and Ren Xingya had been transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office. He said that there was official business at the District Prosecutor's Office, but they had not yet been transferred. When the reporter further inquired why the case was still being handled separately by the military judicial organs, Director Zeng did not give a clear answer. He only said, "This issue will always be resolved." Since Inspector Bai Cheng's accusation of the grain loan case was filed, it has been almost two weeks, and it has not yet been determined who has the jurisdiction to hear the case.</p>
<h3>China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Holds Meeting to Discuss Overall Business Plan</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] After the victory, the state-owned China Merchants Steam Navigation Company returned to Shanghai to resume its operations and received many enemy and puppet ships. The government also purchased a large number of ships from the United States and handed them over to the company. Therefore, the company has a large number of ships, but various routes are still not smooth, which has been criticized by all parties. Recently, colleagues in the business department, seeing that the return of the national government to the capital is about to be completed and the repatriation of Japanese prisoners of war on the Yangtze River is also coming to an end, believed that not only for the sake of transportation on various routes, but also for the company's business, an overall plan should be made. Therefore, they submitted a proposal stating that ships should be allocated to maintain transportation on various routes under military and government transport, which would greatly develop business. With the development of business, income could be increased and the company's economy could be improved. The above proposal has been approved by the general manager and it has been decided to convene a meeting tomorrow (Wednesday) of the heads of all departments and specialists to carefully study the various sections of the proposal.</p>

<h3>Sino-American Agricultural Technology Cooperation: US Delegation to Arrive in Shanghai Tomorrow</h3>
<p>Scheduled to stay in China for five to six months. Minister Zhou comes to Shanghai to prepare for welcome.</p>
<p>Since the victory of the War of Resistance, China's agricultural rehabilitation work has been actively carried out by the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry. However, the establishment of China's agricultural policy, the thorough improvement of agricultural technology, and the increase and promotion of export agricultural products all require referring to the past experiences of friendly countries and utilizing the cooperation of their experts and technology. In September of last year, the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry submitted a request to the Executive Yuan to conduct preliminary consultations with the US government on the issue of Sino-American agricultural technology cooperation. After several months of back-and-forth negotiations, the cooperation plan was recently approved by the governments of China and the United States. Agricultural experts were selected by both governments to jointly form the Sino-American Agricultural Technology Cooperation Team. The main task of the team is to thoroughly investigate the state of Chinese agriculture, refer to American knowledge and experience, and jointly draft specific plans for Sino-American agricultural technology cooperation, with particular emphasis on the improvement of export agricultural products, to provide options for both governments to adopt and implement. The Chinese delegation has been appointed by the Executive Yuan. The American delegation flew from San Francisco on the 22nd of this month and is expected to arrive in Shanghai around the 26th. The Sino-American delegations will first stay in Beijing and Shanghai for a short period of time to make contact with relevant parties, and then travel to various important locations in China for inspection.

<h3>Hu Zewu and Tao Kangde: Trial Concluded, Sentencing on the 29th</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The trial of Hu Zewu, the fake Secretary-General of the Shanghai Municipal Government, and Tao Kangde, the editor of the fake Zhonghua Weekly, concluded yesterday afternoon, and the sentencing is scheduled for the 29th of this month. Hu Zewu argued that he had helped central personnel engage in underground activities in Anhui, Bengbu, and other places, and that the "Constitutional Implementation Committee" in which he participated was an empty document with little significance, and therefore did not cause great harm to the country or the people. Tao Kangde claimed that his editing of "Zhonghua Weekly" was to preserve his life while weakening enemy propaganda, which was beneficial to the people, and that he did not make any statements at the "Greater East Asia Writers' Conference," which did not harm the country. Xu Zuiren, a clerk in the Gongji Rice Shop, was prosecuted by the High Procuratorate as a suspected traitor for allegedly purchasing grain for the enemy. He was interrogated several times and the trial concluded yesterday, with sentencing scheduled for the morning of the 29th of this month.

<h3>Traitorous Spy Hu Lingen Arrested</h3>

He was reported two months ago, and was finally arrested by the Municipal Police Bureau yesterday. It is reported that he will soon be sent to the Ti Lan Qiao High Court for trial.</p>
<h3>Stealing is Worse Than Smuggling in the Huangpu River</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] According to Secretary Liu of the Jianghai Customs Secretariat, the problem of smuggling of foreign goods is not as serious as imagined, as the reasons for smuggling are nothing more than tax evasion and avoidance of prohibited items (such as luxury goods, which are prohibited from import). Currently, the prices of American goods are mostly cheap, so there is no need to evade taxes. The number of luxury goods smuggled in is also not large. He also said that there are currently three types of smuggled goods: those carried by sailors on ships, US military supplies, and those transported by aircraft. Regarding the latter, a company established by Filipinos was discovered two months ago using aircraft to transport smuggled goods. Therefore, customs officers are now stationed at Longhua, Dachang, and Hongqiao airports. Liu also said that the most serious problem at present is theft. Foreign ships often have to anchor in the harbor for weeks or months waiting for a dock or warehouse. During this long period, goods are inevitably stolen. Liu believes that in addition to the customs fulfilling its responsibilities, he also hopes that the military and police authorities will provide assistance.</p>

<h3>Kong Xiangxi's Bodyguard: Sentenced to Imprisonment for Murder</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Kong Xiangxi's bodyguard, Wu Guorong, came to Shanghai from Chongqing after the victory and discovered that his wife, Lu Lili, was living with Xu Li, a graduate of St. John's University who had worked in the fake tax office. After being summoned back, they reconciled. However, Xu Li, who had a habit of spending money, was unemployed, so he often asked Lili for money. Despite repeated reprimands, he still went to see her from time to time. On March 27th of this year, Xu asked Wu Guorong to meet at Tushanwan and demanded money again. The two argued, and Wu drew his usual pistol to threaten him. Xu lunged forward to seize the gun and was shot and killed.

<h3>Massive Robbery at Lao Fengxiang: Both People and Goods Recovered in One Day</h3>

At around 2 PM, they saw Zhu returning home hurriedly and arrested him. He confessed to the robbery without hesitation. Subsequently, the stolen goods, a pistol, and six bullets were recovered at No. 65, Yuanchengbang, Yuyuan Road. Lu Dagen, as an instigator, was also taken back to the bureau and detained, and will be sent to the District Procuratorate for investigation.</p>
<h3>Talking About Fire Brigades</h3>
<p>Fires are less common in hot weather than in winter, so citizens temporarily overlook the importance of the Fire Department. However, they may see ambulances speeding by on the streets every day. Traffic accident events now number more than three or four hundred per month. The Fire Department is also responsible for transporting seriously injured patients to hospitals.</p>
<p>Shanghai's Fire Department has a fairly strong lineup in terms of equipment and personnel. It merged the two fire departments that were directly under the former concession's Municipal Council and the French Municipal Council into one, increasing its strength and expanding its service area to the four suburbs outside the city. The current Fire Department is under the jurisdiction of the Police Bureau, and the director, Zhou Zhaoxiang, previously served in Chongqing.</p>
<p>The organization of the Fire Department is as follows: the Department is divided into three sections. The first section is the Prevention Section, which is responsible for investigating licenses and inspecting fire-fighting equipment in public entertainment venues, factories, and schools. If anything is incomplete, it is corrected in time to prevent fires from occurring. The second section is the Rescue Section, which is responsible for all matters relating to fires, such as rescue, first aid, communications, and administration, as well as training police officers. The third section is the Mechanical Section, which has its own factory to repair damaged fire trucks. There are now two factories, one in Hongkou and one in Taishan District. The factory in Taishan District will soon be moved to Hongkou. In addition to the three sections, there is also a Fire Brigade directly under the Department, which has nine district teams: Central, Hongkou, Yangshupu, Xinzha, Jing'an, Yichang, Taishan, Wuxing, and Xinkaihe. In addition, there are also privately run volunteer fire brigades, distributed in areas such as Shanghai South, Zhabei, Shanghai West, Pudong, and Hongkou. They all liaise with the Fire Department to facilitate their work.</p>
<p>A Total of 152 Vehicles of All Sizes</p>
<p>According to Section Chief Li of the Second Section, the Fire Department has a total of 823 police officers from top to bottom, and a total of 152 vehicles, including bicycles. Among them, there are six light fire trucks, seventeen medium-sized pumper trucks, sixteen large pumper trucks, and six ladder trucks. In addition, there are also rescue vehicles, lighting vehicles, steam pumper trucks, and fire boats. Officers are divided into five types: drivers, firefighters, medical staff, communicators, and lookouts, each with their own specific duties. Section Chief Li believes that firefighting is a specialized profession and that they must learn special skills. After three months of training and passing an examination, they can be promoted to formal police officers. The most important requirements for recruitment are physical strength and the ability to lift heavy objects. Firefighters have one major rest every seven days. The rest of the time, they must be stationed at the fire station in case of emergencies. There are morning exercises every morning, and roll call must be taken at noon. Speaking of their treatment, Section Chief Li shook his head and said, "Considering their work, the reward is too meager." Section Chief Li believes that the outside world has too many misunderstandings about firefighters. "Good and bad cannot be lumped together."</p>
<p>Firefighting Steps</p>
<p>The steps for responding to fire alarms are as follows: The headquarters has a control room. When an alarm is reported from the outside, the control room immediately rings the bell to notify the district team where the fire has occurred. The communications room of the district team receives a direct call from the headquarters and immediately orders the dispatch. At the same time, it reports to the control room. If the fire is large, the control room directly orders other district teams to assist, so the speed is very high. Within a few minutes of receiving the report, the fire truck can arrive at the scene of the fire.</p>
<p>Finally, Section Chief Li said, "The traffic on the streets is too congested, which sometimes hinders the passage of fire trucks." (Shan)</p>

Public Utilities Bureau Director Zhao Zengjue reported on the measures to address the symptoms and root causes of Shanghai's public utilities from January to June of this year, as well as the plans to improve and build a greater Shanghai in the future. Regarding: (1) Water supply issues, such as the plan to establish the West Shanghai Pumping Plant and actively organize a city-wide water supply network. (2) Electricity supply issues, as the city's power generation load has reached its peak, measures are being taken to increase the power supply. By the end of this year, the power plants are expected to increase to 170,000 kilowatts. (3) Gas supply, as the city has only three gas plants, which are insufficient to meet the demand, it is planned to add a plant in the South City. (4) Land transportation, as statistics show that public transportation vehicles have decreased compared to the pre-war period, while private vehicles have increased. Efforts are being made to develop public bus services. The French-owned 21st Road Bus Company has been ordered to find ways to resume operations.

<p>[Our Dispatch] The Municipal Education Bureau, Social Affairs Bureau, and Land Administration Bureau held a joint memorial week at 11:00 AM yesterday at the Social Affairs Bureau auditorium.

After the ceremony, Chen Lifu gave a speech on the issue of Kuomintang-Communist negotiations, stating: Since 1935, the National Government has begun to engage in sincere negotiations with the Communist Party. After eleven years of failure to achieve a satisfactory outcome, it is entirely due to the Communist Party's lack of sincerity. The most important issues at present are: (1) Restoration of transportation, and (2) Military reorganization plan. The Central Government has provided reasonable solutions, but the Communist Party has not complied, resulting in the current "stalemate." However, Chen expressed his hope that the Communist Party would consider the future of the country and the suffering of the people, and meet with "sincerity" to achieve peace as soon as possible. Chen was emotional yesterday, speaking eloquently until the meeting adjourned at 12:30 PM.</p>

As the hurricane is moving inland from Jinhua towards Shanghai, it will sweep past Shanghai and enter the sea last night or at dawn today, when the wind force will increase to a huge level 8.</p>
<p>Navigation Obstructed</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Yesterday morning, the Jianghai Customs received a report from the Astronomical Observatory that a hurricane would hit Shanghai. It immediately hoisted a black ball on the roof of the clock tower flagpole to warn ships to take precautions and prohibit exports to avoid danger. In the evening, it changed to a red light, so the number of ships entering and leaving the port yesterday was greatly reduced. Only the Taigu Company's Niuzhuang ship, from Qingdao, entered the port, arriving at Wusongkou the night before yesterday and entering the port at 6:00 AM yesterday morning. The China Merchants Bureau's Jiangping ship, also from Qingdao, entered the port at around 4:00 PM, and the Jiangtai ship from the Yangtze River entered the port at around 5:00 PM. Only the Xiaoda Express ship, which travels to Chongming, exported. The ship exports every morning and returns to Shanghai in the afternoon, but it was not seen returning to Shanghai yesterday afternoon, probably due to the hurricane. The ships of the Dada Datong Joint Office, which travel to Nantong Haimen, were all suspended yesterday. The Jiangya ship of the Shanghai-Ningbo line of the China Merchants Bureau and the Huohua of the Ping An Bureau also stopped exporting. The Jiangya ship was rescheduled to sail to Ningbo this morning, and the Dahua ship was rescheduled to sail to Ningbo on the 26th. The Haweimen, which travels to India under the management of Tiensh Foreign Firm, also temporarily stopped exporting due to the wind. The Suimiweier, managed by Shunting Foreign Firm, came to Shanghai from the United States and has arrived at Wusongkou. Because the hurricane prevented the pilot from boarding the ship to guide it, it is temporarily anchored outside the port. The Yisheng ship of Yihua Foreign Firm, which came to Shanghai from Hong Kong, was scheduled to arrive yesterday. According to the company's news, the ship is currently sheltering from the wind in Xiamen and will sail here after the wind subsides, which is expected to be delayed by two days.</p>

<h3>Exchange of Trade Goods Between China and Japan: Quantity Differences Still Significant</h3>
<p>Personnel to be dispatched to Japan for inspection early next month</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Dispatch] The exchange of trade goods between China and Japan, since it was entrusted to the Central Trust Bureau by the Executive Yuan, has been developing day by day. However, due to transportation and other related factors, the quantity of exchange is still limited, averaging about several thousand tons per month. If calculated according to the proportions needed by our country, the difference is enormous. At present, the types of goods exchanged mainly include transportation equipment, mining equipment, and silkworm eggs for exports, and wheat, salt, and bran for imports. Based on actual needs, our country hopes to import power equipment and rayon in the future. It is reported that relevant authorities plan to dispatch personnel to Japan early next month to conduct inspections and negotiate future trade goods exchanges.

<h3>National Maritime School Stipulates Enrollment Standards for This Year's Summer Enrollment, Prioritizing Students from Coastal Provinces</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Nanjing Dispatch] In the past, there were very few marine professionals in our country, which led to the decline of maritime power and the withering of the shipping industry. Not only was the maritime shipping industry entirely in the hands of foreigners, but even inland river shipping was mostly occupied by foreign vessels. Scholars believe that a large part of the weakness of the Qing Dynasty was due to the "maritime disease." Now that unequal treaties have been abolished, our country's shipping industry urgently needs to be restored. The Ministry of Education is urgently seeking to cultivate this talent and strive to remedy the situation. It previously planned to establish a naval vocational school, with the school site determined to be at Shangxinhe in Wuchang, and Liu Kaikun was appointed as the school's president. Liu graduated from the first class of the Naval Department of the Huangpu Military Academy, then graduated from the Shipbuilding Department of the Danzig University of Technology in Germany, and worked in shipping in England for many years. He also held important technical positions in Tongji University, the Ministry of Communications and Navy, and the China Merchants Bureau. Two years ago, he was appointed by the Military Commission as the deputy leader of the shipping and shipbuilding inspection delegation to England and wrote many specialized works. After Liu took office as president, he was determined to plan and implement the establishment of a complete National Maritime School. In addition to having spacious and perfect school buildings, there are eleven large and small ships and many motorized sailing ships, and a mechanical practice factory is being planned. In addition to recruiting a small number of students last year, the school stipulates enrollment standards for this year's summer enrollment, prioritizing the enrollment of students from coastal provinces. Personnel will be dispatched to major coastal ports to handle enrollment matters. Furthermore, because the general public still lacks understanding of this, it is ordered to explain the nature of the school and the needs of national construction in the future before enrollment. The number of students admitted will be determined by the candidate's level, physical condition, character, and aspirations, emphasizing quality and temporarily delaying the expansion of quantity.

<h3>Ministry of Education Supervisor Sun Aitang Inspects Education in Taiwan, Flies to Taiwan for Inspection with Wang Peiren</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Nanjing Special Dispatch] The Ministry of Education sent Supervisor Sun Aitang and temporarily hired expert Wang Peiren (current legislator) to inspect education in Taiwan. Sun and Wang have already taken a train from Beijing to Shanghai on the 23rd and will fly to Taiwan from Shanghai for inspection. The scale of secondary education in Taiwan is quite large, and the supply of vehicles for students to go to school is extremely convenient. The facilities for vocational education surpass those of the mainland, and there are plans to establish Taiwan University. It is reported that the inspection by Sun and Wang will last about one month. (One)</p>
<h3>National Women's Normal College Relocation Decided, President Lao Junzhan to Establish Campus at Jiulongpo</h3>

After all matters were completed, the college moved to Jiulongpo, a suburb of Chongqing. (An)</p>
<h3>National Secondary Schools Return to Their Original Locations, Those with Special Circumstances Temporarily Remain the Same</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Chongqing Special Dispatch] During the War of Resistance, in order to assist the faculty and students of secondary schools that had withdrawn from various occupied areas, the Ministry of Education established three temporary national secondary schools in Henan, Sichuan, and Guizhou from December 1937, to accommodate students who had withdrawn from Ji, Cha, Sui, Ping, Jin, Jing, Su, Zhe, and Wan. Later, multiple national secondary schools were established for faculty and students from Shaanxi, Gansu, Hubei, Anhui, Henan, Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi, as well as the Northeast. Vocational, industrial, fishery, and normal schools were also established, as well as schools for children in orphanages to continue their education. The scope of the work increased year by year. After the victory, the education systems in various provinces and cities were restored, and these national secondary schools have been ordered by the Ministry to be managed by the respective provinces and cities. The Ministry of Education is now actively supervising the provinces and cities to handle this matter so that all areas can be completed after the summer. However, it is reported that the national secondary schools in remote provinces, vocational secondary schools, overseas Chinese secondary schools, and the provinces and cities' current capacity to take over this year are temporarily insufficient. Therefore, it is temporarily necessary for the central government to continue to maintain them, or those with special circumstances will temporarily remain the same, remaining national institutions. These include National Suiyuan Secondary School, Huangchuan Secondary School, Hexi Secondary School, Northeast Zhongshan Secondary School, Central Industrial College Joint Vocational School, Central Senior Nursing School, Central Senior Midwifery School, Southwest Zhongshan Senior Industrial School, Senior Commercial Vocational School, Maritime Vocational School, Hanmin Secondary School, Chengda Normal School, Longdong Normal School, and two overseas Chinese secondary and normal schools.

<h3>Kunshan Library Preserves Valuable Documents and Rare Books, County Magistrate Shen Xiafei Submits a Request to the Provincial Government for Awards</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Kunshan Dispatch] The Kunshan Library has magnificent architecture and a rich collection of books, with a history of thirty years since its establishment. It is particularly rich in the writings of the county's sages, including a copy of "Tianxia Junguo Libing Shu" (Book on the Advantages and Disadvantages of the Provinces and States) by the great Ming scholar Gu Tinglin, with inscriptions by collectors Huang Yaopu, Qian Daxin, and others. It was previously owned by the Xu family's Chuanshi Building in Kunshan, and scholars from all over the country competed to see it. Before the War of Resistance, the Shanghai Commercial Press repeatedly borrowed it from the library to be reproduced in the "Sibu Congkan." Currently, the original manuscript and the masterpieces of literary and classical scholars such as Gui Zhenchuan, Zhu Bailu, and Gu Dehui have remained intact despite the war, which is a great blessing for Jiangzuo literature. In reality, this is due to the responsible preservation by Wang, the former director of the Kunshan Library, the instructors, and Lu Jian, Li Qian, and Wu Gang, who were responsible for depositing the books, as well as the local gentry during the War of Resistance. Now, Kunshan County Magistrate Shen Xiafei and Chairman of the Provisional Council Zhu Jingzhi believe that the preservation of this local heritage has a great impact on local literature. Therefore, they have specially requested that Chairman Wang of the Jiangsu Provincial Government praise the personnel who preserved and maintained the items to emphasize culture and education.

<h3>Nanching Secondary School Renamed College, Decided by Jiangsu Provisional Council</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Jiangyin Dispatch] Nanching Secondary School was originally Nanching Academy during the late Qing Dynasty, with extensive school property. It was once renamed Nanching College. After the success of the Northern Expedition of the Revolutionary Army, it was renamed Jiangsu Nanching Secondary School, which is of a public nature. It was originally intended to be transferred to the province, but at that time, the school's property was abundant, and there were concerns that its future would be problematic if it was taken over by the province. After strenuous efforts by the board of directors, it remained a public institution, with the board of directors responsible for funding and not subject to provincial control. Graduates from each session have been talented. In 1937, with the outbreak of the War of Resistance, all of the school's buildings were almost completely destroyed. After the victory, Li Tianmin took over and began reorganization. The number of students increased sharply compared to before the war, and a committee was organized to be responsible for reorganizing the school property such as the sand fields. The Jiangsu Provisional Council decided at its tenth meeting on the 15th to change the school's name to Nanching College, while the secondary school portion was transferred to the province.</p>
<h3>Sichuan Province Guest Teachers and Staff Telegraph Government Requesting Grant of Subsidized Return Travel Expenses, According to the Precedent of Public and Private Primary and Secondary Schools in Chongqing</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Chongqing, 23rd] The Liaison Council of Teachers and Staff of Secondary Schools in various counties and cities, in order to request the issuance of subsidized return travel expenses according to the Chongqing precedent, telegraphed and sent a message yesterday, requesting government assistance, stating: "Since the victory, not only have other public and educational personnel returning to their hometowns received government subsidies, but even righteous people and enemy captives have been transported home by the government.

According to reports, there are a total of 58 units of guest teachers in public and private primary and secondary schools in Chongqing, of which 29 schools can receive return subsidies today. Other schools are also preparing lists, and they will be issued successively once the review is completed.</p>

<h3>Grand Charity Soccer Match Tomorrow, Qingbai and Hong Kong Star East to Meet Again, Du Yuesheng and Others Initiate Plea for Disaster Victims, Tickets Divided into Three Types: 20,000, 15,000, and 10,000</h3>
<p>The disasters in central Hunan and northern Jiangsu are severe. Du Yuesheng, Wu Kaixian, Zhang Shizhao, Fan Shaozeng, Gu Jiatang, and others, in view of this, took advantage of the visit of the Hong Kong Star East soccer team to Shanghai to request a charity soccer match to raise funds for disaster relief. The Sports Association's Soccer Committee has resolved to accept the request and has scheduled a rematch against the local soccer champion Qingbai team at the Yiyuan Stadium at 5:30 PM tomorrow. Star East has played six matches in Shanghai, with four wins and two losses, which is a decent record. The team originally planned to go to Beijing to compete but decided to cancel due to time constraints. Tomorrow's charity match is an unavoidable obligation. Star East previously lost to Qingbai by a score of 1 to 3, so tomorrow is a good opportunity for revenge. The outcome is related to the entire team's reputation, and both sides will surely give their all to compete.</p>
<p>Ticket Prices</p>
<p>According to the committee's announcement, the prices for the charity match tickets are 5,000 yuan and 10,000 yuan for the grandstand, and there will be seats priced at 20,000 yuan inside the stadium. All proceeds, after deducting expenses, will be used to relieve disaster victims in both regions. Mr. Du said, "Buying one more ticket saves one more life." He hopes that soccer fans will show their enthusiasm and lend a hand to the disaster-stricken refugees. Tickets will be sold at the Municipal Gymnasium starting at 1:00 PM tomorrow. Complimentary tickets will not be issued, and long-term tickets will not be valid. Military and police personnel must purchase tickets to enter. The matter concerns relieving disaster victims, so please support this charitable act.</p>
<p>Strict Security</p>
<p>As for the stadium order, new plans have been made and carefully considered. Tomorrow, a large number of military police from the Garrison Command and the Municipal Police Department will be dispatched to maintain order. The police department's patrol cars will also be dispatched. Strict security will be implemented around the Yiyuan Stadium to prevent troublemakers from operating. Those without tickets should not attempt to sneak in, as stealing a ticket is equivalent to stealing from the refugees, and their conscience will surely be condemned.</p>
<p>Last Three Matches</p>
<p>In addition to tomorrow's match, Star East will also perform a small soccer demonstration at the invitation of the Small Soccer Association on Thursday and play against the Donghua team at the invitation of Guanghua University for the Guanghua Cup to raise funds for the university's restoration on Friday. Both matches will be held at the Yiyuan Stadium. The team may return to Hong Kong on the 29th. The schedule for the last three matches is as follows:</p>
<p>Charity Disaster Relief Match: Star East vs. Qingbai, 5:30 PM, June 26th, referee Zhang Le, linesmen Deng Xiaoliang and Huang Renyi.</p>
<p>Small Soccer Demonstration: Star East vs. West Union, afternoon of the 27th, referee and time to be determined separately.</p>

<p>Special Article</p>
<h3>Principal Zhu Kezhen's Speech: Zhejiang University Today and Tomorrow</h3>
<p>— Zhu Rentian</p>
<p>Every month, I receive many letters from high school students and friends, both graduates and soon-to-be graduates, who are filled with longing to attend Zhejiang University. They ask me to report on news about Zhejiang University. At the time, I always politely replied, "Principal Zhu will be coming to Hangzhou soon. Details will be provided later," deflecting their questions. This morning (the 14th), Principal Zhu gathered all faculty and students in the main hall of the main campus to give a detailed report on the situation at Zhejiang University, which can serve as a reference for them and for even more people who aspire to attend Zhejiang University. Therefore, without being ashamed of my own lack of ability, I have extracted a portion of Principal Zhu Kezhen's speech from my diary and presumptuously titled it "Zhejiang University Today and Tomorrow," disclosing it to the public.</p>
<p>Zhejiang University, including faculty and students from the main campus, totals over two thousand people. Except for those carrying heavy loads and graduating students, approximately fifteen hundred people moved back to Hangzhou with the school. Most of the students have passed through Hankou and safely arrived in Nanjing. Except for one student who unfortunately fell and died, the journey has been safe for the majority. They can be expected to arrive in Hangzhou soon. However, due to insufficient school buildings and the time required for construction, no students from either the main campus or branch campuses will be allowed to stay on campus during the summer. As for school staff, books, and equipment, they total approximately three hundred tons, and the luggage of all faculty and students exceeds one thousand tons. In terms of transportation procedures, Zhejiang University is listed as number thirty-seven. However, the school has a fixed opening date, and many instruments and books must arrive within the specified time. Therefore, it was necessary to establish a special office in Chongqing to plan and handle automobile transportation matters. However, today, after the victory, the difficulty of transportation is almost greater than during the war. Transporting each ton from Chongqing to Hangzhou costs over one million national currency. This difficult situation cannot help but make us lament, "Restoration is more difficult than fleeing!"</p>
<p>As for the school building issue, the Zunyi main campus occupies four thousand square units. Therefore, Zhejiang University will need at least six thousand square units after the restoration to solve the working space and accommodation for all faculty and students. Before the war, the school buildings of Zhejiang University were already not considered perfect. Important buildings were destroyed after the fall of the city. Although there are no accurate surveys of the remaining school buildings, a rough estimate is no more than two thousand five hundred square units, leaving a shortage of three thousand five hundred square units. Based on current prices, it would cost approximately 350 million yuan to complete these three thousand five hundred square units of school buildings. However, the Ministry of Education's restoration fund is only 150 million yuan, far from the ideal amount. Considering the practical difficulties, we have temporarily set the school buildings at four thousand square units as the plan to proceed with. The construction of the new one thousand five hundred square units is planned to begin immediately with bidding, aiming to be completed by the end of October. Therefore, the opening date of the school will have to be postponed to the beginning of November.</p>
<p>Due to the limitations of the school buildings, the enrollment and the addition of a medical school, as well as departments to the law school, must be considered. Currently, the number of students in the temporary universities operated by the Ministry of Education in Shanghai, Nanjing, and other places totals five to six thousand. Furthermore, the number of discharged youth soldiers whose academic qualifications are high school graduates or have completed the fifth semester is no less than several thousand. They are planned to be distributed to universities in the Southeast, and naturally, Zhejiang University will not be an exception. However, we know that university education aims to cultivate practical and applicable cadres. Therefore, there must be a semi-official curriculum, a diligent atmosphere, and strict examinations at the school. I remember that a British visiting group's criticism of Zhejiang University was that it could be compared to the famous universities in England in all aspects, which is comforting and reassuring. I personally do not deny the level of the students from the temporary universities and those who served in the military, but they must follow Zhejiang University's consistent practice of entrance examinations or placement examinations. I have also discussed this point with the authorities of the Ministry of Education. However, this is an overall issue, and the wise education authorities should have an overall solution.</p>
<p>Everyone knows that the motto of Zhejiang University is "Seeking Truth." Today's commemoration should be at the former site of the "Seeking Truth Academy." In fact, the two words "Seeking Truth" are not only the guidelines for conduct and dealing with the world, but also the ultimate goal of scientific inquiry in this era.</p>
<p>Yes, the 20th century is the "Century of the People," an era of democracy. In this era, everyone has the freedom of belief and speech. However, we must pay attention to one point: so-called "democracy" naturally takes the welfare of the greatest number of people as the greatest premise and the opinions of the greatest number of people as the overall opinion. However, at the same time, we must respect the opinions of the minority, and at least give the minority as much opportunity to speak as possible. The Communist Party in the British Parliament occupies very few seats, but Communist Party members can still speak freely in Parliament, expressing their views fully. This is true democracy. The Soviet Union does not work that way. They only have the right to speak for the workers and peasants, and they obliterate other classes. This cannot be called true democracy. Therefore, I say: "The British system has equality in political status but inequality in economic status; the Soviet Union has equality in economic status but inequality in political status. In short, they are walking diverging paths. Whether in Hangzhou or in Nongyi, students like to post notices to express their will. Yes, this is the spirit of democracy. However, since it is "expressing one's will," the document should naturally be "borne by oneself." The notice must bear your signature or at least state your address. This is the essence of freedom of speech.</p>
<p>Schools are places for "cultivating people over a hundred years." Their mission is to cultivate practical and applicable talents. Therefore, I oppose any partisan political activities in schools. Several universities in the inland could not straighten their spines or stand up straight because of this. In today's democratic era, we do not oppose freedom of belief, but we deny that schools are places for political parties to compete. While you can have your own thoughts and beliefs while in school, you cannot force everyone in the world to have the same thoughts and beliefs as you, causing a "left? right?" struggle.</p>
<p>Some people object to students' ambitions to "become high officials" and "make a lot of money." I personally do not think so. I think everyone should aspire to "become high officials," but becoming high officials must mean doing great things; everyone must aspire to "make a lot of money," but it must start with undertakings related to "national economy and people's livelihood," such as revitalizing water conservancy, exploiting minerals, and developing transportation. Today, we only know that politics is not on the right track, officials protect each other, and officials are corrupt. In fact, these corrupt officials also shouted slogans of saving the country and wrote slogans of "Down with corrupt officials" like you ten or twenty years ago. Why? This is because they did not pay attention to small things while in school, and these small things are enough to affect the future. For example, taking public light bulbs for private use, breaking glass windows to垫 case files - These are all small things, but they are the roots of corruption. We can also report them for corruption, because light bulbs and glass are all public, national property.</p>

<h3>Record of the Hankou City Sports Meet: Athletics and Gymnastics Competition Divided into Open, Men's, Women's, High School, and Middle School Groups Achieved Good Results</h3>
<p>[This newspaper's Hankou Dispatch] The Hankou City Sports Meet, which has been in preparation for a long time, was originally scheduled to open on June 1st.

<h3>Joe Louis Announces He Will Fight Again This Autumn</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 23rd] Spectators who paid high prices to watch the Joe Louis vs. Blevins fight, along with American sports reporters, were extremely indignant about Blevins's perfunctory performance. New York State Athletic Commission Chairman Ai Geng has also received criticism. New York Democratic Congressman Aujal has also requested the Sports Commission to investigate and not allow Joe Louis and Blevins to obtain [permission] before [conducting] future [matches]. Joe Louis [had] [previously] said that he would not compete again this year, but [fight] organizers Fei Ke Bo and Joe Louis's manager Ma [indicated] that Louis may be [matched] with the recent [winner] against British [heavyweight] champion Woodcock [this coming] autumn, or with Woolcott. Woolcott ranks fourth among the world's [heavyweights], while Morel ranks fifth. Most of the spectators at the Louis vs. Khan fight were foreigners. New Yorkers were unwilling to attend because the ticket prices were too high.</p>

<p>Business News</p>
<h3>Gold Note Transactions Limited; Hong Kong Dollar Declines Compared to Previous Day</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the gold market was very calm, with few transactions. Public sentiment was stable. The morning opened flat. After opening, buying orders were made successively from 1,920,000, gradually pushing the price upward. After 10:00 AM, the central government allocated 150 bars, reaching 1,930,000. Credit loosened. Afterward, the price rose to as high as 1,945,000, then rounded off slightly. At noon, the price struggled around 1,935,000. Spot transactions declined slightly in the afternoon, but next-day transactions were still easily restored. As a result, the price rose 12,000 compared to last Saturday. Ornaments and silver were flat. The black market interest rate was from 1.2 to 1.5 fen.</p>
<p>Foreign currency US dollars were weak but stabilized easily. Transactions were also very limited. After opening at 2,640 yuan in the morning, buying orders were maintained. Soon, the price rose slightly above 2,670 yuan. At noon, the price hovered around 2,660 yuan. The afternoon remained stable. As a result, the price was similar to last Saturday. The Hong Kong dollar weakened, resulting in a decline of 15 yuan. The Hong Kong exchange rate retreated from 535 yuan. The rupee rose slightly, reaching 650 yuan. Fewer transactions. The British exchange rate was from 8,200 to 8,400, while the US exchange rate was apparently flat but quietly inactive.</p>
<h3>Unified C Only Has Balancing Accounts</h3>
<p>Small Banks Absorb Miscellaneous Brands</p>
<p>There were no formal transactions for public bonds. There were some uncompleted transactions outside the market, with mutual offsetting. Miscellaneous brands were actively absorbed by small banks with surplus funds. Unified C was entirely balancing accounts. Physical transactions were unheard of. The asking price rose from 700 yuan to around 850 yuan at the close. As a result, the price was slightly more stable compared to last Saturday. Miscellaneous brands ranged from 350 yuan to 550 yuan.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the yarn market generally soared. Double Horse yarn led the way, with miscellaneous brands following closely. All counts, coarse and fine, rose. Double Horse was the most dramatic, jumping 120,000 yuan, mainly because customers from South China uniquely favored this brand. They flocked to a new high of 1,560,000. However,</p>
<h3>Double Horse Jumps 120,000; Miscellaneous Brands, Coarse and Fine, Follow Suit</h3>
<p>Golden Rooster and Dafa both had a feeling of being out of reach. It is said that Double Horse is bought from Guangdong and resold to Nanyang and Hong Kong, targeting only Double Horse. Transactions for mid-size 20s and 16s yarn were not very enthusiastic, but prices followed, rising 30,000 to 40,000. Weaving factories' appetites for 42s double-strand thread gradually opened up, also rising 70,000. At noon, the Textile Construction Company opened yarn auctions as usual. Fine yarn prices, 32s and above, were marked up 50,000 to 200,000 compared to the previous period. However, 100s double-strand thread was no longer available for sale yesterday, and a new type of no-brand spool yarn was added, priced at 150,000, with each piece weighing only 268 pounds.</p>
<h3>Spot Cotton Transactions Still Good</h3>
<p>Yesterday, New York American cotton telegraphs reported a rise of 9 to 12 pounds. The deferred price was 29.48, the forward price was 29.55, and the Middling spot price was 30.10. Spot cotton transactions in Shanghai were better. Shenxin First Factory purchased special Middling cotton at 117,500 yuan. The Sixth Factory purchased Brazilian cotton at 95,000 yuan. In addition, there were many inter-dealer transactions of cotton grades, with prices rising 1,000 to 2,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>The Cloth Market Recovers Again</h3>
<p>Since the collapse of the public bond black market, a portion of speculative funds has shifted to the yarn and cloth market. At the same time, actual demand from Sichuan, Hubei, Guangdong, and other places has gradually become active. Sales of serge and shirting were particularly strong. Due to the fact that the northern region has not shut down, the cloth market has recovered again.</p>
<h3>Supply and Demand Both Very Active; Rayon Continues to Rise</h3>
<p>Yesterday, 120-count Dàqiáo rayon opened at 1,800,000 yuan. The highest was 1,845,000 yuan, and the lowest was over 1,780,000 yuan. It closed at 1,850,000 yuan. In the afternoon, someone tried to raise the price, but someone supplied as much as possible, so the price weakened slightly, closing at 1,820,000 yuan, 20,000 yuan higher than the previous weekend. 120-count miscellaneous brands all rose 20,000 to 30,000 yuan. 150-count white Fuji bright sold for 440,000 to 450,000 yuan. 75 Golden Rooster semi-lustrous sold for 660,000 to 670,000 yuan. Yesterday, Indian merchants traded factory silk. Evenly graded 75 silk sold for 2,300,000 yuan. Silk prices for users were slightly weaker. Traders bought and sold 30 to 40 bundles, with prices from 2,100,000 to 2,150,000 yuan. Another bundle sold for 2,050,000 to 2,100,000 yuan. There were no transactions for dry warp. The asking price was slightly smaller than the weekend by 40,000 to 50,000 yuan. The price of American bed linen was 20,000 yuan lower than last weekend, and there were no transactions. Dàchéng checkered crépon was 4,900 yuan in the morning and 5,060 yuan in the afternoon, 150 yuan lower than last weekend.</p>
<h3>Rice Market: Customers and Goods Sharply Reduced</h3>
<p>Rice Shops Still Allocate According to Market; Flour Still Not Available</p>
<p>The number of customer and goods registrations in the rice market yesterday decreased sharply, with only 764 bags. This included 295 bags of Yang Xian rice, 158 bags of Wu Xian rice, 10 bags of Bai Yuan rice, 270 bags of milled Xian rice, and 31 bags of brown rice. Rice shops still distribute rice to retail outlets according to the market, so the market situation remained unchanged, and the price of each type of goods remained the same. Flour was not available. Northern wheat shipments slowed down, and prices fell slightly. The oil market remained stable. Guangbang soybeans were inquired about, and high-quality goods saw a rise of 1,000 yuan, while mid-range goods rose by 300 to 500 yuan. Corn also rose by 1,000 yuan. Raw kernels and yellow sesame were similar. Broad beans digested slightly better, rising by 1,000 yuan. Bran sales were active in the countryside, and prices rose by 200 yuan.</p>
<h3>The First Batch of New Keehong Arrives; High Costs Make Sales Difficult</h3>
<p>The first batch of this year's new Keehong black tea from Qimen, Anhui, has been shipped to Shanghai by Zhenhe Tea Shop. However, due to the high costs of picking, processing, and all other expenses, the cost is considerable, reaching several hundred thousand yuan per dan. Considering the current situation, it is feared that sales will not be able to continue smoothly. As for the foreign tea market, the high cost of Chinese tea has also greatly impacted exports. However, recently, tea merchants, in order to expand foreign sales, are willing to suffer losses despite the tight prices overseas. They are still rushing to produce, planning to declare for export as the shipping date approaches. Most holders of various domestic sales teas are unwilling to sell them off at a loss, and the trend of selling is decreasing. However, shops in this street and salt merchants from other regions are currently well-stocked and do not need to rush purchases, leading to a sluggish market.</p>
<h3>Bricks and Tiles Sell Well; Hollow Bricks Are in Short Supply</h3>
<p>Recently, the arrival of bricks and tiles by ship has been infrequent, hindering sales, and prices have risen across the board. Blue roof tiles are selling the best, due to the construction of flat-roofed houses everywhere, and their selling price is higher than bricks. The hollow bricks produced by large and medium-sized brick and tile factories have limited sales in Shanghai, but many merchants from Nanjing and other regions are coming to Shanghai to purchase them, resulting in a shortage.</p>
<h3>Copper Shortage; American Factories Close; Electrical Industry Stagnates</h3>
<p>[Reuters, New York, 24th] The current supply situation of copper in the United States is extremely serious. Many factories have been forced to close due to a lack of supply, with the electrical industry being particularly affected. Manufacturers are very confused by the recently implemented new price controls. Producers who are allowed to raise the price limit are limited to those who have reached a new wage agreement with labor unions after February 14, and the agreement must be approved by the government. To date, only Anaconda Copper and one small producer are eligible to raise the price limit. The remaining manufacturers can only sell at the old price limit of 12 cents per pound, while the new price limit is 14 and 3/8 cents per pound.</p>
<h3>Cost of Living in the U.S. Gradually Increases; Up One-Third Compared to Seven Years Ago</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 23rd] The Department of Labor recently released a report stating that the cost of living in the United States has increased by one-third since 1939 and is still rising. The prices of daily necessities have increased by 0.5% to 1% in the past 30 days. This is still much better compared to the doubling of prices in the United States after World War I.</p>
<h3>Company Permits Sales; Sugar Prices Tend to Stabilize</h3>
<p>Yesterday, after industry representatives negotiated with the Taiwan Company regarding the sugar market, they received a satisfactory response, and it was agreed that all spot goods could be sold today. However, inventories are indeed limited, so spot prices will remain at the original level. At the same time, road goods can be traded, with prices around 95,000 yuan. As a result, the trend has stabilized. The association's opening price for medium white sugar in the morning was only 100,600 yuan, but later rose from 89,000 yuan to 110,000 yuan, before returning to 88,000 yuan in the afternoon. Numbered goods opened with 22 packages of Diaoqing at 95,000 yuan, Xiaokang at 91,000 yuan, and then 93,000 yuan. Several dozen baskets of Xinghua white were at 100,600 yuan, a decrease of nearly 10,000 yuan. It is heard that there are over 2,000 packages of Youqing road goods that will arrive within a few days. If so, then the future market should be slightly stable.</p>
<h3>White Coal Shows Some Activity</h3>
<p>Previously, the white coal market was flooded with arrivals of white coal briquettes, and sales were brisk, causing market prices to fall frequently. Importers, on the other hand, adopted a wait-and-see attitude, fearing that market prices would fall again. Recently, due to excessive price declines, which were not enough to cover costs, arrivals have sharply decreased. Furthermore, most small merchants who urgently needed funds have been selling off their stock. Although current sales are still slow, some large merchants with strong financial resources are taking advantage of the low prices to buy in preparation for winter demand. Therefore, trading has been slightly more active than before. In addition, due to shortages, the price of white coal small pieces is quite firm. The market price of Yangquan small pieces has even exceeded that of Yangquan screened briquettes.</p>
<h3>Financial Reform; American Advisor Conducting Research</h3>
<p>The newly appointed Supreme Financial Advisor to the Executive Yuan, Mr. Teyman, arrived in Shanghai from the United States a few days ago. He has set up an office at the Bank of China and has begun to study various financial problems. Mr. Teyman held an important position at the Federal Reserve Bank in the United States and has conducted extensive research on Far Eastern financial issues. In the future, the focus of his research will be on reforming various financial facilities for the authorities' reference.</p>
<h3>Panic Gradually Subsides; Chinese and Foreign Stock Markets Improve</h3>
<p>With the situation of Chinese stocks stabilized and public panic somewhat subsided, buyers are active. Yongsha rose from 490 yuan to 530 yuan, Meiya rose from 2800 yuan to 3380 yuan, Jingfu had a low price of 190 yuan and a high price of 230 yuan. The situation of Xinguang was the most impressive, rising from 200 yuan to 253 yuan. Qinxing had a low price of 150 yuan and a high price of 193 yuan. After a high at noon, there was a slight pullback, gradually hovering. As a result, compared to the previous close, Yongsha rose slightly, Meiya recovered by a little less than 10%, Jingfu rose by 5%, and Xinguang and Qinxing each improved by 10%. Among the unpopular medium-sized stocks, Xinxing improved by a little less than 10%. Zhongfang and Huochai were flat. Small stocks each improved by around 10%. Foreign stocks gradually showed light. Large shareholders of industry stocks were absorbing some. All large stocks, except Jardine Matheson, and all small stocks, except Asia Paper, improved. The popular Ewo Silk rose from 9200 yuan to 9800 yuan, and British American Tobacco rose from 8000 yuan to 8400 yuan. The rest were also carried along. As a result, compared to last Saturday, Jardine Matheson and Asia Paper rose slightly, while British American Tobacco and Ewo Silk improved by about 5%. The rest rose by between 10% and 15%.</p>
<h3>Seafood Market Situation is Stable and Favorable</h3>
<p>High-grade raw starch is in short supply, while low-grade and russet starch remain weak. Foreign vegetables and Xianglian are flat and dull. Hairtail, shrimp tails, and sea cicadas continue to sell well, showing an active trend. Dried mussels and pepper are affected by the Hong Kong exchange rate. After opening tight, the trend is quite stable and favorable. The supply of shiitake mushrooms and cellophane noodles is scarce, so they continue to rise. Dried scallops and zha cai are in a short supply as the former has extremely low inventories and the latter has a lack of goods from the production area, thus the price increases steadily. Most other items also increased more than decreased.</p>
<h3>After Guangdong Opens Foreign Exchange; Hong Kong Dollars Cannot Be Used for Settlement; Simplified Settlement Procedures Implemented</h3>
<p>[Guangzhou, 22nd (Airmail)] The Joint Management Committee of Designated Foreign Exchange Settlement Banks has now stipulated that, from the 14th of this month, all designated banks must not pay in Hong Kong dollars for foreign exchange settlement. The acceptance of the difference in national currency should also be stopped immediately. In addition, the exchange rate for foreign exchange purchases has been changed from 390 yuan to 400 yuan, and the selling price remains unchanged at 410 yuan, effective from the 11th of this month. As for the prices after foreign exchange was listed in this city, the buying price is 2,020 yuan, and the selling price is 1,980 yuan. Simplified procedures have also been implemented. From now on, export merchants only need to fill out the certificate and have the owner sell the foreign exchange to the designated bank, which can then be submitted to customs for inspection and release. As for applying to purchase foreign exchange, the quantity of goods purchased must be filled out, and after verification, an exchange order will be issued.</p>
<h3>New Crop of Black Leaf Lychee Has Been Shipped</h3>
<p>According to news from Guangdong, the first batch of new Black Leaf Lychee crop produced in Guangdong has been shipped and is on its way, expected to arrive in Shanghai within days. The total amount is said to be around one hundred and several tens of dan. As each item gradually sees new goods, prices are expected to gradually ease.</p>
<h3>Japanese Textile Trade; India to Take Its Place; Expansion Plan Actively Underway</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Bombay, 24th] In accordance with the expansion policy recently proposed by the Post-War Planning Committee, the Indian government has specially announced the application for a license method, so that new textile mills can be built throughout India. The Indian government and the committee agree that the cotton cloth production of various textile mills can reach an increase of 50%. If this is achieved, the annual cotton cloth production in India can reach as much as 7.2 billion yards. However, textile machinery is in severe shortage, and the production target can only reach 35%, which is 1.7 billion yards, and 2,750,000 spindles must be added. The Manchester Guardian recently commented on India's plan, saying: If India no longer relies on imported cotton goods as a result, and can instead achieve an export balance of 10% of its total production, then India will be able to rise to the position of Japan in the international textile trade and compete with China for its future, which is very clear.</p>
<h3>Luodian Buttons Difficult to Export; Also Due to High Costs</h3>
<p>Domestic Luodian buttons are favored by Europeans and Americans, so they occupied an important position in exports during the war. However, after the war, due to gradually rising wholesale prices, foreigners have switched to using substitutes. According to the person in charge of a British foreign firm, before the war, the wholesale price of Luodian buttons was only 80 cents per gross, but after the war, it has doubled. However, there are still few exporters, due to raw materials, wages, freight, and other factors affecting the high cost.</p>
<p>The raw material for making Luodian buttons is mussel shells, which is a natural specialty of our country. After this eight-year war of resistance, the amount of sea mussels that have bred over the years must be considerable. According to someone in the button industry, before the war, Japan monopolized more than half of the button market in Europe and America. After the war, Japan no longer exports buttons. If the authorities pay attention to this export and provide funds to assist the industry, so as to reduce costs and improve products, it is not difficult to win the entire European and American market.</p>
<h3>Sales of White Tung Oil Are Weak</h3>
<p>Although there is a foreign sales outlet for white tung oil, the export is difficult to develop because the US market price does not match that of our country. It is heard that the current price of oil in the New York market is 39 US cents per pound, and the US government also uses this as the purchase price limit. If it exceeds this purchase price, it will be subject to a fine. Therefore, those who send telegrams to our country with prices higher than this receive no response. However, based on this calculation, the price of delivering goods to Shanghai is only 35 cents per pound, so those engaged in this industry feel that the export trade is like chicken ribs. Recently, although there have been sales, at only 71,200 yuan per dan, transactions are not very enthusiastic. In addition, the Hankou market is better by 23,000 yuan, making export profits even thinner. The largest number of local exports should come from vegetable oil plants, because national capital is used to operate international trade, which is something that ordinary businesses cannot hope to match. The domestic selling price of oil is between 68,900 yuan and 70,000 yuan. Sales are not strong, and the situation is stable.</p>
<h3>Shandong Salt Arrives Steadily</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The Taikoo Company's Hubei steamer, traveling south from Tianjin via Qingdao, transported 5,000 bags of salt and over 1,300 pieces of flue-cured tobacco of varying sizes from Qingdao. It arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday and is now docked at Taikoo Wharf No. 3 in Puxi to unload. In addition, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Jiangping steamer, which was dispatched to Qingdao a few days ago, returned to Shanghai yesterday, bringing 300 tons of refined salt, which belongs to the Da Ye Salt Company.</p>
<h3>An Overview of the Economic Situation in Northern China</h3>
<p>Living Expenses in Beijing and Tianjin Are Lower Than in Shanghai; Clothing Is Lacking Outside the Customs, but Food Is Sufficient</p>
<p>Li Junyao, Director of the Issuing Bureau of the Central Bank, and Li Lixia, Director of the Financial Business Inspection Department, returned to Shanghai by plane from Tianjin. According to their reports, the financial, industrial, and commercial sectors of North China have been experiencing difficulties due to the incomplete restoration of transportation and the difficulties in the circulation of goods. However, through the efforts of the authorities, the circulation of transportation and finance is improving day by day. Although commodity prices in Beijing and Tianjin are not much different from Shanghai, general living expenses are still one-half cheaper than in Shanghai, especially in Beijing. Tianjin is a large commercial port in the north with a dense population and well-developed financial, industrial, and commercial sectors, but speculation is far less rampant than in Shanghai. An foreign exchange department has now been established in the Tianjin branch of the Central Bank. Importers and exporters in North China can settle nearby in Tianjin, and then the Central Bank will centralize the handling in Shanghai.</p>
<p>President Bei was recommended to provide assistance to the Tianjin export industry and Bei has directed the Central Bank and the specified banks in accordance with the previously promulgated rules to encourage exports, exporters could borrow with overseas letters of credit from each designated bank for a low-interest loan of five percent per week. The remaining aspects are being drafted, and after consultation with the Ministry of Finance and instructions from President Song, they can be formally released.</p>
<p>Mr. Li also went to Shenyang, Changchun, Shanhaiguan, and other places to conduct on-the-spot investigations of the financial, industrial, and commercial sectors of these areas, collecting a great deal of material. According to him, under the 50 years of Japanese management in the Northeast, finance, industry, mining, and agriculture have all made considerable progress. However, after the victory, the Soviet army occupied the Northeast, and most of the well-equipped industrial and mining machinery was dismantled and transported away by the Soviet army. After the subsequent destruction by the communist army, most of the factories and mines have only shells remaining. The houses along the railway lines have been burned to the ground, and the scene is very desolate.</p>
<p>What the Northeast currently lacks most is cotton woven clothing. Because the Japanese built very few textile facilities in the Northeast, cotton fabrics used to come from Japan. Now that the source of Japanese goods has been cut off, only a small number of domestic solo merchants are transporting goods for assistance. Fortunately, the Northeast is rich in agricultural products, and grain reserves are sufficient. Grain prices, rice, and flour have increased by seven times compared to before the war, while coarse grains have only increased by three times. As for industry and mining, although they have been dismantled by the Soviet army and destroyed by the communist army, judging from the Anshan Iron and Steel Factory, the remaining machinery, tools, and equipment, when concentrated and used, are still the most well-equipped iron and steel machinery factory in the country. The Central Government considers the legal currencies circulating in the Northeast to be the Northeast Circulating Certificates, Soviet military scrip, and Manchuria Bank notes. Anti-Japanese currency issued by the Chinese communists is also widely distributed among the people, so the currency system in the area is very complicated.</p>
<h3>Economic Briefs</h3>
<p>[Tianjin News] The British firms Taikoo and Jardine Matheson previously had little business due to unsmooth sea transportation. The two firms established a joint office, but as overseas trade has gradually become active, they have dissolved the joint office and are operating independently.</p>
<p>Central Committee member Chen Guofu initiated the establishment of a large-scale broadcasting company, named the China Broadcasting Corporation, with capital of 40 billion. The Central Broadcasting Station will be merged into the company, which will be a joint government-business venture. Part of the company will raise commercial shares, and planning work is actively underway.</p>
<p>Foreign insurance companies have never been regulated by our government, which has greatly affected the people. After the victory, in order to stabilize the Shanghai financial market, the Ministry of Finance stipulated that foreign insurance companies must join the Insurance Association and complete membership procedures within three months. It is now learned that American companies have formally applied for membership, while British companies have not yet expressed their intentions.</p>

<h3>Keelung—Taiwan's First Port</h3>
<p>Our Newspaper's 14th Airmail [Report] Special Correspondent Mu Yun</p>
<p>Unfold a map of China, and Taiwan is like a fish that floats on the blue sea, crouching in the southeast, swimming northwest, and the port of Keelung resembles a fish's mouth. The inner and outer breakwaters become the teeth of the earth, the train line and road network that run through the entire island are the fish's nervous system, and the islands of Pengjia Yu, Huaping Yu, and Mianhua Yu that float outside the port are the foam spat out by the fish's mouth. Looking at Keelung from a topographical point of view is enough to illustrate the importance of Chu, and its connection with Shanghai, Tokyo, Southeast Asia, Saigon, Hong Kong, Xiamen, and major commercial ports further illustrates that in addition to mutual dependence, Keelung has become a major breathing channel.</p>
<p>The Japanese saw the geographical superiority and spent forty long years to build her from a desolate land into an excellent harbor, and armed her into a modern naval port. These signs can be seen in the points and lines of Keelung City.</p>
<p>Port Capacity Reached Saturation Point Before the War</p>
<p>Keelung City, which occupies 4.4 square kilometers, is surrounded by low mountain peaks on the east, south, and west sides, and the vast sea on the north side. The land that can be used is only 1 square kilometer. On such a small piece of land, it constitutes the central area of ​​the commercial district, the political and legal district, the villa district, the fishery district, and the transportation district. On the sea in the north, two breakwaters built with cement below 40 meters clearly divide the harbor into inner and outer. The outer port has no wharf facilities, and eight out of ten parts of the inner port are completely artificial. Port C has three parts: the west port, where ships of 20,000 tons can dock freely, and ships of 5,000 tons can rely on 14 berths, and it is connected to the railway line. The cranes on the dock automatically unload goods from the hold into the warehouse, and passengers can walk down from the second floor. The east port has no artificial wharf, and ships of less than 1,000 tons can dock. The south port is a densely populated fishing port, and there is a canal for the safety and dispatch of fishing boats to facilitate water transportation.</p>
<p>Looking at the development figures before the war, 300,000 passengers and 4 million tons of cargo pass through each year. From the point of view of the port's digestion capacity, she has reached a saturation point.</p>
<p>Twenty-Five Major Bombings Show the Depth of Deprivation</p>
<p>The total population of Keelung City is 106,479. After 25 bombings by Allied aircraft, the population sharply decreased to 40,454, and 5,056 of the 8,000 houses were bombed. The area affected in the urban area was 1,712,500 square meters, accounting for 56% of the total area. General loss figures are: automobiles 66%, telephones 81%, telegrams 100%, electric wires 90%, hospitals 66%, water pipes 63%, fishing boats 53%, meat production 91%, seafood production 69%, and the total number of ships sunk and damaged was 484, about 80,000 tons. The trade volume, which is the city's lifeline, before the war (1941) was 65,397,881 yuan, and after the war (1945) it was 9,843,694 yuan, a sharp decrease of 55,854,187 yuan. Imports before the war were 27,409,074 yuan, and after the war were 8,731,214, a sharp decrease of 18,677,860 yuan. Before the war, there were 1,983 ships entering the port, with 8,357,601 tons, and after the war there were 2 ships with 12,769 tons. Before the war, there were 1,987 ships leaving the port, and after the war there were 2 ships.</p>
<p>These figures help the reporter understand Keelung and also make us understand the depth of deprivation that the war brought to Japan and the resource supply station of Taiwan, because the prosperity and decline of Keelung is a reflection of the whole of Taiwan.</p>
<p>Construction on the Ruins Completes Preliminary Work</p>
<p>The construction of Keelung City is like rebuilding on the ruins. At present, the municipal government is transplanting the plan carried out by the Reconstruction Company after the Tokyo earthquake to Keelung City. The Keelung Reconstruction Company uses NT$50 million as capital, of which 60% is funded by the provincial treasury and 40% by the municipal government. Calculated at the market price at the end of last year, the total reconstruction cost is NT$700 million. At present, the city government has completed the preliminary emergency work, such as street cleaning and sewer repairs. The entire restoration project can be completed by next summer.</p>
<p>The most important optimistic basis is that the fishery production accounts for 60% of the island's total production. As long as ice and fuel (sesame oil) can be supplied without worry, production can be doubled. The restoration of motorized sailing boats has been affected by exchange rates and prices every year, but this is only temporary. Once shipping is restored, Keelung will naturally develop.</p>
<p>Of the 5,056 houses, 1,200 have been repaired and 2,800 have been newly built, accounting for 75% of the total number of bombed houses. NT$1.7 million was raised from the Relief Association, and the project to repair 2,700 meters of sewers has already begun. The project requires NT$7 million and 90 sunny days. The contractor has repaired 16,000 square meters of roads, and two bridges have received assistance from the Port Authority. Repairs began in the middle of this month.</p>
<p>The Greater Keelung City Plan Makes the City's Position Increasingly Important</p>
<p>As the first mayor of Taiwan's first port, Shi Yanhan has recruited 13 Japanese experts to formulate a Greater Keelung City construction plan with the goal of 20 years and the foundation of 5 years. If this plan can be implemented, Keelung can be developed to more than double its size in 20 years, namely 600,000 passengers, 8 million tons of cargo, and 5,400 ships.</p>
<p>In this plan, the existing Keelung City will be completely transformed into a transportation and fishery district. The political culture and residential areas must be moved to Badu and Ruifang, suburbs nearby. The small train running every five minutes will serve as the regular transportation backbone.</p>
<p>Mayor Shi told reporters excitedly that this ideal construction plan will make the status of Keelung Port even more important. If ships from foreign seas want to reach Tainan, they must first pass Keelung and go around along the outer sea of ​​Taitung, which would take a whole day due to the distance.</p>
<p>Keelung hopes to be built up quickly and maintain the glory of the first port. It should also be like a fish. As long as the internal and external subjective and objective environments tend to improve, there should always be a day of rapid progress.</p>

<h3>Glimpses of Qiongya</h3>
<p>Haikou, 5th Dispatch - Island Traveler</p>
<p>Shortly after the enemy's surrender, I, as a reporter, arrived in Qiongzhou and have resided there for several months. I have paid close attention to observing the various aspects of Qiongya's situation, and the actual information I have obtained is quite substantial. Now, I will depict the recent state of Qiongya from various perspectives, which I believe will be welcomed by those who care about Qiongya, especially those Qiongya people living abroad.</p>
<p>Qiongya has been ravaged by the enemy for seven long years, truly leaving it scarred and riddled with holes. It is just like a weak and ailing patient in urgent need of a miraculous cure. General Cai Jinjun, Chairman of the Guangdong Provincial Government's Qiongya Office, as the highest administrative officer of the region and as the physician of this patient, upon taking office in mid-February of this year, immediately outlined four major principles: People's Security, People's Convenience, People's Sustenance, and People's Renewal. He also identified two urgent tasks: Security is paramount, and relief is paramount. At the same time, he published a "Respectful Address to the Compatriots of Qiongya" of tens of thousands of words, eloquently discussing the matters that Qiongya should promote and reform in the future, and listing nine major goals, taking both fundamental and symptomatic approaches to governing Qiong.</p>
<p>In the restoration work, concerning political restoration, it is of course necessary to first create a new political atmosphere to win back the hearts of the people, and the completion of local autonomy and the strengthening of grassroots political organizations are particularly important plans. Since the establishment of the Provincial Chairman's Qiongya Office three months ago, it has intensified its efforts to promote this work of organizing and training the people. The most actively handled matters are the reorganization of the Baojia system and the implementation of the joint security and joint defense system. At the same time, it is making every effort to strengthen local self-defense forces, so that the people of the entire island, under organized and trained political facilities, can be mobilized from restoration to jointly undertake the great cause of self-rescue, village building, and national construction.</p>
<p>The county-level representative bodies of public opinion, the County Provisional Councils, have all been established long ago. The first round of vetting of candidates for public office has been completed and is still being processed. The village representative assemblies and Bao representative assemblies, these most grassroots organs of public opinion, are also being planned intensively and are scheduled to be held within a limited time. In particular, the election of provincial senators this time fully demonstrated the spirit of popular sovereignty, which cannot but be said to be a validation of the people's exercise of their civil rights.</p>
<h3>Severe Disaster, Overcome with Human Power</h3>
<p>Currently, the most laborious work is still the relief effort. The disaster situation in Qiongya is indeed too severe. It is said that during the occupation period, Qiongya lost as many as 500,000 people. In addition, after the soldiers came the famine, with a poor harvest last autumn and a severe drought this summer, the food shortage has reached its peak. The government is now trying to use "human power" to overcome "natural disasters": on the one hand, it is appealing for large quantities of relief supplies to be transported here; the Executive Yuan has allocated 80 million yuan for relief and 35 million yuan for emergency agricultural loans, which have also been paid out. On the other hand, it is repatriating foreign refugees to their hometowns, and it is estimated that 15,000 refugees have been continuously evacuated and sent away. There are still more than 10,000 Taiwanese compatriots who need supplies, and efforts are being intensified to find ships to send them back to Taiwan. In addition, efforts such as promoting thrift, increasing the planting of miscellaneous grains, and prohibiting the export of grain and the prohibition of alcohol are all being carried out vigorously.</p>
<h3>Cultural Desert, No Less Than Food Shortage</h3>
<p>In post-war Qiongya, the cultural desert is no less than the food shortage. Because during the enemy occupation, all cultural institutions were completely destroyed. As a result of our intensified educational restoration, to date, 90% of the public and private secondary schools on the island have been restored, 70% of the central elementary schools have been restored, and 50% of the Bao National Schools have been restored. The people's education centers, reading rooms, and so on in various counties have also been established one after another. Currently, there are two newspaper offices in Haikou, namely the Minguo Daily and the Heping Daily. There is one magazine, the "Heping Bi-Monthly", being published, and another, "Qiongya Construction," is in preparation. Recently, the "Qiongya Cultural Association" has been planned, and the Qiongya cultural movement is gradually showing signs of vigorous development.</p>
<p>Qiongya has been occupied for many years, education is backward, and there is a severe shortage of cadre talent. Now, in the restoration and construction, a large number of grassroots cadres are urgently needed. The prior condition for building a new Qiongya is still the problem of people. Director Cai, seeing this, specially planned to hold the "Qiongya Administrative Cadre Training Class." The first phase of the class is divided into five groups: Autonomy, Household Registration, Police Administration, Assistant Governance, and Cooperation. A total of 241 students started school on the 3rd of this month. According to Director Cai's plan, the training department of the class has twenty-six different sections and aims to create more than 6,400 cadre talents in a very short period of time to meet the current urgent needs.</p>
<h3>Transportation Lines Under Active Construction</h3>
<p>According to investigations: In terms of transportation, since the establishment of the Qiongya District Office of the Highway Department of the Construction Department, it has intensified its efforts to rush to repair highways. The current length of the road lines that can be opened to traffic is about 700 kilometers and is still under rush repair. There are 12 management stations, including Haikou East, Haikou West, Wenchang, Jiaji South, Jiaji North, Wanning, Lingshui, Ding'an, Jinjiang, Lingao, and Nada. Currently, there are approximately 150 registered and licensed public and commercial vehicles operating. In terms of communications: The Chairman's Office is very active in the construction of telecommunications and telephones and plans to establish a radio station in each county. Now, in addition to the nine district stations, nine branch stations have been established in Qiongshan, Ding'an, Qiongbei County, Lingao, Wenchang, Yaxian, Qiongdong, Ganen, and Wanning. At the same time, for telephones, it is planned to erect an island-wide trunk line, with Haikou, Jiaji, Yulin, Beili, and Nada as the five central strongholds, and to connect with the branch lines of various counties in order to achieve smooth communication.</p>
<h3>Pioneers, For the Development of Qiongzhou</h3>
<p>During the occupation period, the enemy operated many factories and had various industrial facilities. Since we took over, some have been destroyed by the enemy in advance, and some have been lost due to improper reception management. In addition, due to the problem of talent and the problem of economy, most of the factories and industrial facilities have not been able to continue operating, which is not only our shame, but also a great loss to the country. Regarding this issue of industrial restoration, I, as a reporter, once asked Director Cai, and he said: All factories and industrial facilities that can be operated by the people should be handed over to the people to operate, in order to supplement the government's insufficient strength. This opinion has been presented to the relevant parties, so that industry can be restored as soon as possible and further revitalized. Qiongya is rich in resources, and everything can be developed, especially those most related to the national economy and people's livelihood, such as farmland irrigation, fisheries, salt industry, and sugar industry, which have endless benefits. It is hoped that entrepreneurs will actively invest and operate. Regarding the development of Qiongya, the government has high expectations for the heroic pioneers of the overseas Chinese community. The people of Qiongya are rich in creativity, and many of them are engaged in industry and commerce abroad. They have both rich experience in operating industry and commerce and considerable capital, so it is hoped that these overseas Chinese will return to their hometowns to invest and work together to build a new Qiongya.</p>
<h3>Scene of Hefei City</h3>
<p>Hefei Dispatch, this newspaper, June - Correspondent Fei Chaoran</p>
<p>With the sound of firecrackers, the Japanese devils ran away, the provincial government moved to Hefei, and the righteous people returned to their hometowns. The merchants and people in Feicheng, who were under the iron heel, dared to do business boldly, and the various businesses of the wealthy merchants of Lihuang City also followed suit. The commercial firms that had moved far to the rear have also returned with goods. Giant currents from all directions converge here. As a result, the ancient city, which was covered with weeds and wilderness, has been transformed into a bustling market with cars, horses, and people, and merchants gathering.</p>
<p>Merchants and Travelers Gather, Singing and Music Seethe</p>
<p>Because this place is the location of the heads of the provincial party, government, and military, various levels of institutions and downsized personnel from the sixty-two counties are constantly flowing here. Therefore, hotels, restaurants, and bathhouses are newly opened like bamboo shoots after rain, and they are constantly flowing and often full. Large-scale restaurants such as "Taibai Restaurant" and "China-America Restaurant" and bathhouses such as "China" and "New Life" have also emerged. Moreover, the Hefei Grand Theater, which moved here from Lihuang and was performed in by Li Wenzhong, is full of gongs and drums and singing and music, which can especially break the silence of the market in the past.</p>
<p>City Appearance to Be Reorganized, Bridges Floating</p>
<p>The provincial government, considering that the streets of Hefei are narrow and do not meet urban conditions, originally planned to open four wide roads in the city in a "well" shape. However, if it is implemented, the city houses must be greatly demolished, and the people who have been greatly injured after the disaster cannot bear the loss, so they are hesitant to start construction. They have only temporarily ordered the provincial government's long-term husband team to renovate the rugged stone road from the front street, Sipaifang to the Great Academy into a fish-ridge-back-style flat and spacious road, and rebuilt the original site of the steel-bone cement Sipaifang, which was bombed by the enemy, into an artistic wooden tower made of pine trees, standing upright like Dharma, solemn and majestic. Outside Nanxunmen, the Bao Xiaosugong Temple, which was compared to the Qinghe River in the Song Dynasty, was selfless, and had ten miles of lotus flowers and ten thousand willows, has been in disrepair for a long time and has been eroded by wind and rain. The provincial government and people from all walks of life have advocated reconstruction and have appointed Bao Zhengjie, a descendant of the temple, to take charge of it. They also plan to create Xiaosu Park, on the one hand to increase the city scenery, on the other hand to commemorate the former sages. The funds are tentatively set at 30 million yuan, and Chairman Li has independently donated 10 million yuan of his clean government funds to subsidize the grand event. The rest is being raised, and construction will begin soon. In the near future, Feicheng can restore its pre-war prosperity, or even surpass it. However, the shaking bridges are frightening. Except for the section from Hefei to Jiulonggang, which uses the foundation of the Huainan Road, which is still in good condition, the rest of the roads are bumpy like a baby's cradle, causing dizziness and often causing rollovers, which damages the safety of passengers, resulting in the rumor that "taking a car is like running an air raid alarm."</p>
<p>Lights Gradually Brighten, Market Quiet</p>
<p>The shortcoming is that in the evening, two months ago, the market mostly used vegetable oil lamps, and the light was like a bean. The night market was almost zero. In recent months, a large amount of kerosene has been transported to the city, and half of the commercial firms have switched to gasoline lamps, and the dark streets have become bright. Recently, Cai Shidun, an American electrical engineer sent by the United Relief Agency, has kindly come here and promised to be responsible for allocating engines and equipment from the United Relief Agency to help restore the city. People from all walks of life have expressed their appreciation after hearing about it. However, it must be said that although the Hefei market is gradually prospering, except for hotels, restaurants, and bathhouses, the other industries are not very good. Even the aristocratic Taibai Restaurant and China-America Restaurant have announced that they are going out of business. It can only be hoped that the five grains will be abundant in the second half of the year, and the business of the golden September and silver October will make up for the losses in the first half of the year.</p>
<p>Severe Housing Shortage, Rice Prices Rise</p>
<p>At the same time, the housing shortage is still serious. The huge city of Zhouban, forty miles around, has been destroyed by 10-20% in the urban area and 70-80% in the residential area, and the population has increased sharply, exceeding the supply. The landlords took the opportunity to hoard, reduced their own residences, and asked for high rents. Recently, the monthly rent for each room in the city has reached 20,000-30,000 yuan, and the monthly rent for each room has reached 3,000-4,000 yuan. Some even prepay the rent for one year. Public education personnel cannot afford it and are organizing a housing fund evaluation committee to demand a reduction. The police bureau has also drafted regulations on rent, which have been submitted to the provincial government and will be announced for implementation as soon as they are approved. The price of rice here was only 1,500 yuan per stone last autumn, but recently, due to the high price of rice along the river, merchants have come to purchase and transport it for profit, and it has risen sharply to 30,000-40,000 yuan, so that the people cannot live, and many cannot get a full meal all day long and eat unripe wheat in spring. The authorities should ban rice exports, and now is the time.</p>

<h3>How Can the Prevention of Plague Be Divided by Boundaries?</h3>
<p>Dear Editor: Recently, the plague in Shanghai has been rampant, and everyone is in danger. After the new Director of the Health Bureau, Director Zhang, took office, he focused on epidemic prevention. At the same time, the Executive Headquarters expressed its intention to act in unison and convened an epidemic prevention meeting on the 16th of this month. Central and local officials in charge and hygiene leaders were invited to attend, concentrating their efforts and mobilizing the entire body to extinguish the plague in the city. The Executive Headquarters allocated more than 1,000 pounds of DDT and several trucks to the Health Bureau, and provided as much assistance as possible for epidemic prevention equipment, medicines, and funds. At the same time, the Health Bureau borrowed 30 trucks and jeeps from the Executive Headquarters to participate in epidemic prevention work. With such consistent efforts from above and below to prevent the epidemic, the five million citizens of Shanghai will certainly not need to be afraid of the plague, and everyone will be safe, right? However, according to people who know the inside story, before Director Zhang took office, the Executive Headquarters also convened an epidemic prevention meeting, but not only were the central officials in charge and the hygiene leaders not invited to participate, but even the local health officials were not notified to attend. At that time, the Health Bureau, in order to prevent the plague from spreading, repeatedly requested the Executive Headquarters to issue epidemic prevention equipment and medicines and to allocate trucks, but except for only 100 pounds of DDT, nothing was allocated, and trucks had to be purchased from the Executive Headquarters after paying a fee. Under the extreme lack of epidemic prevention funds and epidemic prevention equipment and medicines, the former staff members had to work hard and engage in epidemic prevention. Fortunately, thanks to God's blessing, there was no major chaos, and it passed due to personnel changes. In such a situation, we citizens are really confused. Is it true that the lives of our citizens can only be guaranteed if the local officials have a relationship with the authorities in charge? The plague is prevalent every year, and active prevention before the event is more important than passive eradication after the event. Why did the Executive Headquarters provide no assistance to the Health Bureau's requests before Director Zhang took office, and even the epidemic prevention meetings did not notify the local health administration personnel to attend? Is it because Director Zhang was transferred from the Executive Headquarters, and his performance is related to the Executive Headquarters, so they took such special action? It is important to know that a supervisory department should treat the things that local agencies should promote and reform based on the matter, not based on the person. The safety of people's lives is important, and this kind of administrative favoritism is evil. While the plague is rampant, in addition to hoping that you will work hard to make amends and engage in epidemic prevention, for the sake of the safety of citizens' lives in the future, please eliminate this evil habit of administrative protection of private individuals! Sincerely, reader Wu Yangzhen. Nineteenth day of the month.</p>
<h3>Translators Request to Take the Overseas Study Exam</h3>
<p>Dear Editor: According to reports, the Youth Army Demobilization Administration, in order to encourage retired Youth Army members to further their studies, has selected a number of graduates from specialized schools or above to study abroad. It has obtained the consent of the Ministry of Education, and the Ministry of Education will draft the regulations and hold the exam together with the Ministry of Education's public-funded overseas study exam on July 21. This shows the government's utmost sincerity in rewarding the youth. We are reminded of a group of translators in the army. From the time the Flying Tigers came to China in the 31st year to the time when the Allied forces came in large numbers after the surrender of Japan, the Ministry of Education and the Foreign Affairs Bureau successively recruited more than 3,000 students from various universities in the rear to serve as translators in the army, risking their lives and enduring hardships. We dare not say that we have contributed to the war of resistance, but we have indeed fulfilled our national duty. The sacrifice of 17 translator friends such as Yang Daxiong of Jiaotong University, Miao Bin of Lianhe University, and Zheng Dengchi is a good example. At the beginning of the recruitment, the Ministry of Education and the Foreign Affairs Bureau stipulated that "10% of the translators who have performed well after demobilization will be sent to study abroad at public expense." When the translators were dismissed, the Foreign Affairs Bureau also emphasized that "the number of people studying abroad at public expense will be increased to 20% or 30%." At that time, there were also certificates for participating in the overseas study exam. After the victory, the translators returned from various battlefields and accepted dismissal from August 16 of last year to the beginning of this year. After that, it was once reported that the translator's overseas study exam would be held in mid-May. When the news of the Ministry of Education's overseas study exam was released, there was a saying that "the problem of overseas study for translators and youth army members will be handled together." Now that the problem of public-funded overseas study for the Youth Army has been solved, the problem of overseas study for translators has not been mentioned. Now we request the Foreign Affairs Bureau to work with the Ministry of Education to follow the promulgated laws and regulations, announce the selection of 20% or 30% of retired translators to participate in this public-funded overseas study exam, or announce the formulation of other measures. We will (1) appeal to society and ask all sectors to urge the Foreign Affairs Bureau and the Ministry of Education to pay attention; (2) ask the professors and principals of the universities that organized the recruitment of translators to inquire and urge the Foreign Affairs Bureau and the Ministry of Education; (3) contact retired translators and work hard to apply. Whether the matter can be realized is up to the government. We are only making a request and reporting to the government that there is still a small outstanding case in the process of restoration. Our assumed contact points are: (1) Dong Pengnian, Nanjing First People's Education Museum, (2) Zhang Yuying, Mechanical Engineering Department of Chongqing Shapingba Central University, Zhou Jie, Xiaowenquan Central Political School, (5) Shi Hongxi, Shanghai Public Utility Bureau, Yang Chuanling, Soochow University, Cao Fa, Zhengyan Newspaper, (4) Meng Fanying, Hubei Branch of the Hankou Executive Headquarters, (5) Luo Shigao, Beiping Social Bureau, (6) Chen Yongchang, Kunming National University. A group of retired translators: Yang Baoheng (Fudan), Shi Hongxi (Jiaotong University), Yang Chuanling (Soochow University), Zhang Yuying (Central University), Zhou Jie (Central Political School), Meng Fanying (Lianhe University), Lin Dunhua (Zhejiang University), Tang Tianxiong (Zhejiang University), Liu Shuhan (Chongqing University), Zhang Zhao (Fudan), Hu Qilin (Lianhe University), He Sizhang (Central University), Wan Benzhen (Fudan), Shi Jingzhi (Fudan), Zhu Fa (Fudan), Ge Linsheng (Fudan), Lin Jiwu (Fudan), Lu Weici (Central University), Dong Pengnian (Fudan), etc. June 18.</p>

<h3>A War Correspondent's View of the Bloodstains of Lincheng</h3>
<p>— Zhong Yong</p>
<p>Lincheng Correspondence, June 5th</p>
<p>The 19th Headquarters and the 97th Army were besieged and attacked in Lincheng by over ten thousand of the Communist army's main force. From November 24th of the 34th year of the Republic [1945] until now, it has been almost half a year. During tense periods of the war, all parties were concerned about the safety and loss of Lincheng. The safety of Lincheng greatly affected the overall situation. Fortunately, the Lincheng garrison had been influenced by the Party's education and the wise leadership of Commander-in-Chief Chen. Therefore, no matter how difficult the environment was, they persevered. The people of Lincheng also cooperated wholeheartedly, and various parties offered comfort and encouragement, enabling the isolated city to stand firm for three months without any problems. Although the conflict has stopped and the dawn of peace is gradually appearing, the Lincheng garrison is still heavily surrounded by the Communist army, and the difficult situation remains. The Lincheng garrison is also working tirelessly and diligently to live their laborious and difficult lives. As a journalist working with the army, I witnessed the people's wails of despair, the soldiers' loyalty and bravery, and the Communist army's "extraordinary measures." I am filled with emotion and will briefly report what I saw to my readers.</p>
<p>The Situation in Lincheng</p>
<p>Lincheng is the gateway to southern Shandong, the barrier of northern Jiangsu, the fulcrum of the Linzao Railway Line, and an important town on the Jinpu Railway Line. A large amount of coal from Zaozhuang is transported through Lincheng, supplying the Jinpu and Longhai lines. At the same time, the Lincheng water tower is the only railway facility on the Jinpu Line. It took the enemy three long years to complete this great project during their occupation. Now that the water towers in Hanzhuang, Tengxian, and Yanzhou have been destroyed by the Communist army, only this water tower remains. If Lincheng is not defended and this remaining water tower is destroyed by the Communist army, even if there is peace in the future and the railway is allowed to be rebuilt, the destruction of this water tower will render transportation useless. Therefore, abandoning Lincheng not only cuts off north-south transportation, but also threatens Xuzhou in northern Jiangsu. At the same time, the Jinpu and Longhai lines will immediately experience a coal shortage, and the restoration of railway transportation will be hopeless. Today, Lincheng is important both militarily and in terms of people's livelihood.</p>
<p>Blood-Soaked Phoenix Mountain</p>
<p>Phoenix Mountain is located about two miles northeast of Lincheng. After our army entered Lincheng, it sent the Second Battalion of the 86th Regiment of the 29th Division to guard it. From a high position, it coordinated with our army's strongholds in Xinglongzhuang, Silishi, and Dongtuo. On the night of November 29th, Chen Yi led the Fourth Division of the Second Division of the New Fourth Army, with a force of about 20,000 people, to launch a sudden attack on Phoenix Mountain. Our army was forced to defend itself and retaliated. After a fierce battle all night, the Communist army suffered more than 400 casualties. The next day, the Communist army added about 10,000 more people from the Fifth and Ninth Brigades and attacked our hilltop positions with intensive artillery fire. However, the defenders of our positions were brave and composed, displaying a high degree of fighting spirit, wounding more than 12,200 of the Communist army, with corpses strewn across the mountains. The war continued until December 1st. Our army was exhausted after a long battle, the disparity in numbers was too great, and the fortifications on the hilltop were almost completely destroyed. Therefore, this loyal and brave group finally sacrificed heroically together with Phoenix Mountain.</p>
<p>Xinglongzhuang Set Ablaze</p>
<p>The war clouds of Phoenix Mountain had not yet dissipated when the flames of Xinglongzhuang began to burn. On December 2nd, after capturing Phoenix Mountain, the Communist army continued to pounce on Xinglongzhuang. The soldiers of the First and Second Battalions of the 68th Regiment, under the command of Regiment Commander Kang Qingru, were forced to resist. At that time, the sound of artillery fire was deafening. After two nights of continuous fighting, the Communist army suffered more than 2,000 casualties and had not crossed the defense line by one step. However, the third day was even more intense. The Communist army concentrated artillery fire on the fortifications of the village walls and used dense formations to cover their fierce assault, immediately engaging in close combat and bayonet fighting. At this time, the northern part of Xinglongzhuang had been occupied by the Communist army, and our army was only defending the southern part. The war had become chaotic, and houses were burning in the artillery fire, with flames soaring into the sky and smoke filling the air. The war continued until the fourth day, when our southern defenders began a counterattack, repeatedly charging and killing, with shouts of killing shaking the wilderness. They finally completely annihilated the Communist army occupying the northern part. As a result, Xinglongzhuang was safe after being in danger. In this battle, the Communist army sacrificed more than 7,000 people and more than 800 were captured, while we suffered more than 400 casualties.</p>
<p>Fierce Battle at Linshantou</p>
<p>Linshantou is located about two miles southeast of Lincheng. Xue Village is at the southwest foot of the hill. Both were garrisoned by the Third Battalion of the 85th Regiment of the 29th Division. Since occupying it, it had been attacked by the Communist army several times at night. Fortunately, our defenders were vigilant, and the enemy did not succeed. On December 9th, after the Communist army's attack on Xinglongzhuang failed and suffered a major setback, they mobilized the Second Division and the Ninth Brigade and launched a sudden attack on Linshantou. At the same time, they launched a feigned attack on Lincheng. The Communist army used the Second Division to attack Xue Village and the Ninth Brigade to attack Linshantou. Xue Village was first bombarded by the Communist army's artillery fire. Later, due to the disparity in numbers, they charged into the position at dawn and launched a street battle, fighting fiercely with bayonets all night. Part of our defending army heroically sacrificed, and part retreated to the Linshantou position. Linshantou insisted on not retreating under the fierce attack of the Ninth Brigade for a long time and wounded more than 1,400 of the Communist army. At this time, the Communist army reinforced with more than 3,000 people and tightly surrounded Linshantou. It lasted until the next night before being ordered to withdraw automatically. In this battle, the Communist army suffered more than 4,000 casualties.</p>
<p>Soldiers and War Horses</p>
<p>Because Lincheng has been besieged for too long, the troops have no food to eat and are often hungry. The refugees are the same. The people are refugees, and the troops are hungry troops with no food to eat. Everyone has compassion. Driven by compassion, they automatically saved five qian [approx. 1.85 grams] of food per person per day in extremely difficult circumstances to help the suffering compatriots. Although this amount is small, this rare compassion made the refugees grateful and tearful.</p>
<p>During the long period of fighting, food could not be transported, and the soldiers felt malnourished, and the mules and horses felt that there was not enough fodder. Therefore, our soldiers and war horses were often hungry. I saw officers and soldiers in the streets of Lincheng who had changed their appearance after being hungry for a long time. Their hair was deeper, their temples were longer, their eyeballs were sunken, and a state of hardship and malnutrition was fully expressed. But their spirit was still full of prosperity. I cannot analyze the form of mules and horses. To sum up in one sentence, all the horses have become skeletons, and many have died.</p>
<p>Rarely Fragrant Vegetable Roots</p>
<p>Confucius ran out of food in Chen and did not know the taste of meat for three months. Later generations sympathized with him. The garrison in Yicheng not only did not know the taste of meat for three months, but also did not know the taste of vegetables for three months. There are more people than vegetables, and the supply is not enough to meet the demand. Buying a little vegetable is many times more difficult than buying delicacies from mountains and seas. As long as you find a little vegetable, no matter how valuable it is, it is lucky to buy it. A few merchants have invisibly raised the price of vegetables. They said that it was because they took the greatest risk to smuggle them from the so-called "liberated areas." The people of Lincheng really have a feeling of rare vegetable root fragrance. Because there are no trees, the flying birds have lost their rightful branch to perch on.</p>

<p>(1) Zhu Mengping asks: I admire your compassion and service to society. I have a few questions: (1) My daughter is weak and often suffers from diarrhea, and her urine sometimes contains chyle. The Chinese medicine pediatrician diagnoses her as weak. What is the disease and what medicine should she take? (2) I have been engaged in underground work, enduring hardship and hard work, which has led to physical weakness and lack of energy for treatment. This spring, dysentery relapsed, with blood in the stool. In the end, I had to inject (Emetine) to stop it. Every week, I have nocturnal emission without dreams. How should I seek treatment? What medicine is appropriate? (2) Is Vita-Spermin effective as recommended by a friend?</p>
<p>[Dr. Zhang Zhongming answers] (1) For your daughter's illness, you should first check her stool and urine to determine the treatment plan. (2) Nocturnal emission without dreams is caused by long-term illness and physical weakness. You should first treat malaria and dysentery, and then pay attention to recuperation. (3) Vita-Spermin is effective for neurasthenia. (2) Yang Qiuming asks: I am 25 years old, unmarried, and physically weak, so thin that I can't bear it. After walking for fifteen minutes, my face turns green and I am weak, and my spirit is lethargic. I went to the hospital for a physical examination and was not told what was wrong. The doctor examined my whole body and said that I was not sick. Recently, a doctor ordered me to take Vitamin B, but ten injections were ineffective. Now I have purchased Vita-Spermin and am injecting it. Please advise (1) Can I inject it? Are there any side effects? (2) If I do not have the diseases listed in the leaflet, is it okay to inject it? (3) What is your opinion on my condition?</p>
<p>[Dr. Zhang Zhongming answers] (1) No side effects. (2) Vita-Spermin is effective for neurasthenia and physical weakness. (3) You should pay attention to your health and nutrition, and your physique will naturally become stronger.</p>

<h3>After the Worry</h3>
<p>— Shao Fu</p>
<p>The world is surging. Gold bars and US dollars are prevalent. The current social atmosphere is heading towards a place with no religion, no faith, and a complete bankruptcy of spiritual life. It is really dangerous!</p>
<p>Even so, among the chaos and muddleheadedness, there are still good people. They are content with poverty, abide by their duties, and treat others with love and sincerity. They strictly abide by moral creeds, but they do not use this to flaunt themselves. Although the number of such people is small, they cannot help but command respect.</p>
<p>I know a doctor who hung the following couplet on the wall of his clinic: "Only seek everyone's health / Not counting one's own constant poverty" (meaning roughly the same)</p>
<p>He has indeed put what is said in this couplet into practice. He not only treats patients with care, but even a few dollars less is fine. Compared with the current quack doctors who extort money, it is like heaven and earth.</p>
<p>I also know a bureau chief who wrote on the first page of his pocket notebook:</p>
<p>1. Be responsible but do not take credit, 2. Respect other people's opinions, 3. Be willing to suffer losses.</p>
<p>He arrives early and leaves late, lives in a public dormitory, never does meaningless socializing, and never wastes a penny of public money. He is diligent and conscientious, and no one in his department does not respect and love him. He relies on a fixed salary every month to maintain his poor life for his family of four.</p>
<p>Writing here, I saw another piece of news in the evening paper:</p>
<p>[Shenyang, 24th] Since the enemy surrendered, the huge amount of materials left behind in various parts of the Northeast, in addition to being mostly transported away by the Soviet army or looted by the Communist army, there are also quite a few remaining among the people. However, they are all sold privately, claiming losses. Now, Shi Lingyun, the owner of the Yonghe Can Factory, has voluntarily donated the valuable air force equipment worth tens of millions of yuan stored there by the Japanese aircraft factory (Manfei) to the 13th Regional Command of the Air Force. This item can be sold as scrap iron and is worth millions of yuan.</p>
<p>These are probably the stars in the dark night: We are still full of hope despite our worries about the current social atmosphere.</p>
<h3>Butterfly and Moth Exhibition</h3>
<p>— Wei</p>
<p>Recently in Chengdu, there was a "Butterfly and Moth Exhibition" with the aim of promoting natural science.</p>
<p>The exhibitor is Ling Xiao, a student of the Electrical Engineering Department of Wuhan University. The exhibition site is on the second floor of the YMCA on Chunxi Road. When you walk into the exhibition hall, you can see all kinds of butterfly and moth specimens, some of which you have never seen before. It is said that most of these exhibits were captured by Ling in Jiading, Emei, and Shaanxi in recent years. Among them are the petite and exquisite Tiger Butterfly, the brilliantly gorgeous Dung-Feeding Butterfly, the transparent and jade-like Floating Leaf Butterfly, and the Cabbage Butterfly, which produces seven generations a year. He divided the various butterflies and moths into more than 100 kinds of specimens. Each group is composed of four butterflies and moths, two male and two female, divided into front and back, and arranged in a very orderly manner in elegantly decorated mirror frames. The wings are complete and lifelike, making the viewers praise and compliment them. That kind of careful and patient spirit is really admirable.</p>
<p>Among the precious specimens, there are three: One often rests on willow leaves, the butterfly wings are originally brownish-yellow, but if you look at them from the side, they turn into a beautiful violet color. The second is the Dead Leaf Butterfly, whose wings are very similar to withered autumn leaves. They often rest on branches. Because of their shape like dead leaves, it is extremely difficult to find them. The third is a pair of butterflies in the act of mating: and were caught and even made, and have maintained their original state. Ling himself calls it his masterpiece, because the mating time of butterflies is short, and they open as soon as they touch. This is Ling's only harvest in the history of butterfly collecting.</p>
<p>In addition, the second exhibition room shows the method of collecting butterflies: including the specimens of Ling's butterfly collecting history, as well as the various processes of catching, breeding, collecting, and installation, and there is a "Distribution Table of Butterflies in China, Japan, and Korea" by Leech of England hanging on the wall. Among them, the most interesting exhibition is the living specimens of butterfly life history. From egg to adult, the various processes in between are placed in four places. It is clear at a glance. According to Ling, butterfly catching must be carried out in sunny weather, and you must wear gray-green clothes and hats, and the catching net must also be gray-green, so as not to startle them. The method of installation. You must first find a way to remove its internal organs, then dry them, flatten them, and then embed them in pre-made cardboard. A thin layer of preservative cotton is placed behind the cardboard, and finally it is placed in a mirror frame. All work must be carried out quickly, because if the time is too long, the butterfly wings will become brittle and difficult to handle.</p>
<p>The third room is the art department, which embeds butterfly wings into pictures with backgrounds. The pictures and meanings are very unique and novel, the carving is delicate, and the atmosphere is natural. One of them is titled "Towards the Phoenix," which was exhibited at Wuhan University in Jiading before. The meaning in the picture is the butterfly of "Phoenix," which was selected as the "Butterfly Queen" with 1,043 votes. Its wings are like peacock feathers, all emerald green and brilliant, which is very pleasing to the eye.</p>
<h3>Mouth</h3>
<p>— Yi Gu</p>
<p>I remember a friend saying that the most beautiful thing about a woman is her two cherry lips. In other words, it is beautiful on the mouth; although that is not a profound truth, it is still very real. At least two words can describe it, or be included, that is, sweet (abstract) and hot (maybe real). Just these two words are enough to meet the conditions of beauty, let alone the bright red color, matched with a fair egg face, who would deny that it does not have great temptation.</p>
<p>But things in the world are often accompanied by advantages and disadvantages. On the other hand, a woman's mouth may be the most talkative, the most fond of talking, and mostly the most fond of criticizing others. And these comments contain jealousy, suspicion, and even contempt; so many unnecessary disputes and conflicts are invisibly planted, because women are the least able to keep secrets! These disputes may harm one's own life, one's family, and even the entire society and country, which is too terrible!</p>
<p>In fact; not only women's mouths are like this, but even men are no exception. Due to a strong sense of self-esteem, everyone always loves to praise themselves and defend their own shortcomings. If that person can step back to the other party and not argue, then that person either has something to ask of him, or is under the power of force. Otherwise, he is either mentally ill or an idiot. At least he is also a fool.</p>
<p>Saying Good About Yourself</p>
<p>Saying good about yourself is a common problem of ordinary people, so groups, societies, parties, and even countries formed by people will certainly be no exception. So the result of this self-reading, self-loving, and self-justifying is very dangerous.</p>
<p>As for those who make money by mouth and live by mouth, there are even more people. The most practical are radio broadcasters, microphone singers, and stage actors. Storytellers in the book market, and even clothing store clerks on Shilu Road, and in fact, teachers and businessmen are not living by mouth? If department stores or other counter clerks and teachers are not allowed to speak, then the situation is so bad that it is conceivable.</p>
<p>The great American humorist Dr. Lin Yutang once said, "In the United States, all presidents earn the White House seat by lying. Roosevelt is the best at lying: so he was re-elected for four terms." Then, if he had not suffered from cerebral congestion, he might have had hope for another election. This seems too ridiculous, but in the US elections, broadcast speeches are indeed very important to the election.</p>
<p>Although the mouth is not as broad in terms of eating as it is in terms of speaking, it is also worth studying. In today's severe famine, China is still a place where "the rich have a feast of wine, and the poor have half a mouthful of food." And in the places under the double robbery of drought and civil strife, it feels even more true that "the vermilion gate smells of wine and meat, and the road has frozen corpses." Look at Guangzhou, many people die of starvation, but the dance halls are full every day and business is booming.</p>
<p>"Calamity comes from the mouth, and disease enters from the mouth" is indeed a well-known saying, often those who ruin their lives and reputations do so because of their mouth, and among them, those who make mistakes by taking narcotics and drinking are the most. In fact, when God created man, he only created a mouth on his face, originally wanting people to say good words and eat food that is enough to feed their bodies, but mankind has caused various sins and accidents because of their mouth, which may be contrary to the creator's original intention?</p>
<h3>Yunhuan Cartoon - Sanmao Joins the Army (44)</h3>
<p>— Zhang Leping</p>
<h3>If America Were to Be Hit by an Atomic Bomb</h3>
<p>— Translated by Li Chuan</p>
<p>There are many rumors about the power of the atomic bomb. We first heard various miraculous tales in the newspapers, and later we saw news that it was "not as powerful as rumored." A Major de Seversky went to Hiroshima and Nagasaki and wrote an article "Atomic Bomb Hysteria," published in the February issue of Reader's Digest in the United States. He may be the source of this "debunking" news, and he downplayed the power of the atomic bomb. However, his research and observations were superficial, and his conclusions were very definitive in his article. This caused a group of experts to vehemently object. They spent a considerable amount of time in Hiroshima and Nagasaki studying and calculating, and the results they obtained were absolutely different from Major Seversky's "debunking." Their response to the power of the atomic bomb is in the May issue of Reader's Digest in the United States. I have translated it for our readers' reference. Translator's Note</p>
<p>What would happen if we used an atomic bomb like the ones we dropped on Japan to bomb New York City? Especially on the Empire State Building (Note 1)?</p>
<p>I asked Major General Farrell, the deputy commander of Major General Groves, who was in charge of the atomic bomb design, and who was ordered to go to Hiroshima and Nagasaki to inspect the damage after the disaster.</p>
<p>"If the bomb were to land accurately," General Farrell said, "such an atomic bomb could raze the Empire State Building to the ground. Perhaps a few layers of remaining ruins and broken walls would remain on the ground, but that would be a terrible sight. Another possible scenario, which is what one would hope for, is that the atomic bomb lands just outside the building. This situation might completely collapse the upper part of the building." Even the largest ordinary bombs cannot compare with its explosive force.</p>
<p>Aerial Burst vs. Ground Burst</p>
<p>Many experts, scientists, medical professionals, and military experts measured the disaster in Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Among them were one hundred and fourteen experts from the "United States Strategic Bombing Survey" (Note 2). They explored, measured, and took many photos over two months. The results of their painstaking research can accurately determine the potential impact of such an atomic bomb on other cities in the world. These experts unanimously and vehemently disputed Major Seversky's speculation, which claimed that if New York or Chicago were hit by such an atomic bomb, the disaster and loss of life would be the same as those caused by a ten-ton giant bomb.</p>
<p>They also believed that Seversky's article dangerously underestimated the terror of the atomic bomb and would lead people to a false sense of security at critical moments.</p>
<p>The bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki were deliberately detonated at a very high altitude to maximize the area of the blast and the destructive shock wave. The center of the explosion could completely flatten brick buildings several stories high within a mile; one-story brick houses could be flattened within "one and a half miles." In Nagasaki, factory chimneys within four miles and under shifted, cracked, or collapsed. Some barracks four and a half miles away collapsed. Ten percent of the glass shattered at seven miles. Glass also shattered at twelve miles.</p>
<p>When we look at the towering buildings of American cities, it is easy to believe that they are much more difficult to destroy than the fragile Japanese cities. It is easy to forget that even the buildings in our cities contain more than nine-tenths of houses made of rough bricks, stones, or wood, which are not much stronger than the buildings destroyed in Hiroshima and Nagasaki.</p>
<p>Three Square Miles of Scorched Earth</p>
<p>General Farrell has now returned to his former position as the chief engineer of the New York State Department of Public Works, and is a construction professional with a bright future. When I asked him to elaborate on the impact on New York, he replied, "If a single atomic bomb were to explode at the appropriate height above a typical American city, I believe the radius of that violent blast could reach one mile or more." This means that the houses in an area exceeding three square miles would be destroyed or ruined to the extent that no living creatures could remain there.</p>
<p>But can our great office buildings withstand that violent bombing? I sat with Dr. Morrison (a physicist who participated in the atomic bomb tests in New Mexico, Los Alamos) on a rattan chair by a street in downtown New York City and looked out. "American skyscrapers," he said, "look stronger than they actually are. They are walls built layer by layer with bricks or stones, with each layer of wall placed on a steel frame. If a Nagasaki-type atomic bomb were to fall nearby in the air, the walls of these buildings would fall like leaves from a tree, killing or injuring the people inside, and the broken bricks would clog the streets. If it falls near the ground, those bricks and stones will shoot open like cannonballs."</p>
<p>General Groves was questioned by the Special Committee on Atomic Energy convened by Senator McMahon about the impact of an atomic bomb on Washington. He replied, "If the bomb falls right in the center of the five-sided area, then this pentagon will be completely destroyed." General Groves must know this, because the construction of the pentagon area was under his supervision. "If an attack were to target potential enemy targets," he continued, "it would fall on the triangle area of the United States and those government agencies, and the area of destruction may be two miles in diameter." In other words, the resulting destruction and loss of life would be enough to cause the federal government to hang a sign saying, "Urgently needs repair, temporarily closed!"</p>
<p>Doomsday Exaggerations</p>
<p>Major Seversky, in his article, did not recognize that a revolution had taken place in military science and bluntly said that the impact of the atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki was "exaggerated." He was shocked by the contradictory situation, namely what he saw and the "neurotic" informal propaganda, which made him think this way. There was no fact of matter "vaporizing" into "spots of light" in an "instant." The bombing was not anything "special" because concrete buildings still had "structural solidity; the disaster and death were entirely due to "fire, just fire"—because of the spread of fire, not the fire directly caused by the bomb's heat.</p>
<p>The experts' answer to that last complaint was, "Why? Fire doesn't have to be anything new, as long as it does its job. Before the bomb was dropped, accurate calculations were made based on the target and detailed studies of Japanese buildings. Major Seversky found such a disappointing conclusion, this has accurately achieved the ideal purpose. The bomb used in Hiroshima was detonated at a certain height to flatten the largest number of Japanese-style wooden houses, which were set on fire in this way. If the bomb had exploded closer to the ground, the strange phenomenon of evaporation might have occurred, more concrete buildings might have been flattened, and a small area might have been directly scorched by the bomb. But that would be a meaningless waste. We don't need to add 'spots of light' or other flattened effects to the Japanese landscape. We needed to end a war. We did it. With two bombs. If those couldn't move Seversky, then he is one of those people who will not complain until the end of the world."</p>
<p>The experts felt that Major Seversky was too negligent in his observation of the destructive power that made an empire surrender! They clearly pointed out that he must not have seen a long concrete building in a school, two hundred feet away from the zero point, with half of its upper two floors cracked in this bombing. There was also another building whose collapsing concrete walls indicated how much thrust the entire building had received with diagonal jagged cracks. He did not mention the twenty-one concrete buildings near the bombing site in Hiroshima, four of which were completely destroyed, and ten of which were structurally damaged. His observation points overlooked the fact that many Japanese buildings were more sturdy than similar buildings built in the United States, in order to resist earthquakes. He saw that flagpoles, weather vanes, and other fragile things had not been destroyed or burned in the bombing, but he had never seen twenty flagpoles bent, or the paint on an oil depot 6,500 feet from the zero point burned bright by the heat of the explosion, or the charred plants on a small hill 7,000 feet away.</p>
<p>The Power of 20,000 Tons of Explosives</p>
<p>Major Seversky's opinion that such a bomb falling on American cities "would only cause the same disaster as a ten-ton giant bomb" was the most strange to the experts. Such a bomb contains only five tons of TNT, while the power of an atomic bomb explosion is no less than 20,000 tons of TNT.</p>
<p>I had seen the photo of the clumsy-looking Hiroshima school building 2,400 feet away, the upper two floors of which had been destroyed, and asked General Farrell about the impact of a giant bomb on New York.</p>
<p>"A giant bomb," he said, "can be explained by its name, it can only bomb one Block (Note 3). That is four acres. Let's assume that a ten-ton bomb were to fall in the center of four Blocks, and all of them were low buildings, bombing or severely damaging sixteen acres, that is only one-fortieth of a square mile. If an atomic bomb explodes on the ground in the same situation—conservatively speaking—it is at least eighty times larger than the area bombed by a giant bomb; if it explodes at a considerable height, it must be at least one hundred and twenty times larger."</p>
<p>Dr. Morrison thought that the power of the atomic bomb was at least 100 times greater than that of a giant bomb, perhaps 300 times or 1,000 times. A civil engineer from the United States Strategic Bombing Survey (USBSS) estimated that the power of the atomic bomb, even in fragile Hiroshima, was only 100 to 200 times greater. The Vice Chairman of the United States Strategic Bombing Survey, Nitz, said that Major Seversky's remarks were "completely beyond the scope of reason."</p>
<p>In contrast, the 114 experts of the United States Strategic Bombing Survey spent thousands of man-hours in Hiroshima and Nagasaki researching and calculating. Major Seversky admitted that he had not done any calculations and only stayed in each city for two days, "naturally not enough time," as he told people in the Senate committee, to do "a detailed study."</p>
<p>Major Seversky's work forced us to resolve to "prove these facts without exaggeration." The experts' answer to Major Seversky was that his own errors had turned the facts upside down and that inaccurate reports about the atomic bomb were particularly dangerous. Because, according to his statement, if an atomic bomb of the Hiroshima type did not cause much more damage to American cities than a regular large bomb, we could avoid any unnecessary anxiety and seek that ostrich-like foolish happiness! At the same time, the worldwide control of this terrible weapon could be postponed!</p>
<p>"Living people already know how to make a bomb whose destructiveness is equivalent to one million ten-ton giant bombs. If such a bomb were to fall on Washington or other major cities, you can imagine the tragic destruction of those buildings and the annihilation of the city's population," said Dr. Edward U. Condon, consultant for bomb design and Chairman of the National Bureau of Standards.</p>
<p>(Note 1) The Empire State Building is more than 120 stories high and is the tallest skyscraper in New York City.</p>
<p>(Note 2) Original name U.S. Strategic Bombing Survey, abbreviated U.S.S.B.S.</p>
<p>(Note 3) Giant bomb, original name Blockbuster. The area between four streets is called a Block. Buster means bomber, so Blockbuster explains its destructive power by the literal meaning of its name.</p>

<h3>Seal Engraving Talk</h3>
<p>— Gao Tianxin</p>
<p>Epigraphers and Seal Engravers</p>
<p>The characters engraved on seals by epigraphers are based on metal and stone. Metal types include bells, , pans, and pots, hence the name "Metal Script." Stone types include stone drums, , , hence the name "Stone Script." Seal engravers only engrave the shape of the characters. Those who are inferior cannot even do the shape well, let alone the meaning of the ancient Chinese people's creation of characters. Moreover, later generations have another person for writing, unlike epigraphers, who handle writing and engraving all alone. In terms of having another person for specialized writing, it should be precise, and progress should be made over time. Why is it that starting from the age of , until the hair turns white, there is still no progress? Why? The reason for this is that seal engravers read less, do not know how to research; second, they do not specialize in writing seal script, writing all scripts, including regular, cursive, and clerical scripts. What can be engraved also includes all scripts, including regular, cursive, and clerical scripts. Since they do not read and have no academic ability, merely wielding the knife, how can there be excellent works?</p>

<h3>The Question of Remarriage</h3>
<p>— Ba Ling</p>
<p>"Should a woman remarry after her husband dies?" In the current situation of Chinese society, it still seems to be a question worth discussing.</p>
<p>We know that in our country's society, a part, and even a large part, of feudal ideas are still deeply imprinted in the minds of the general public—especially in the minds of rural people. They still hold to the "male supremacy" ideology, believing that a man can of course remarry after his wife dies. Wealthy men even hold grand banquets with music to remarry a woman. Onlookers not only do not criticize it at all but also express envy. On the other hand, if a woman remarries after her husband dies, she not only does not receive the sympathy of relatives and neighbors, but also faces many cold remarks behind her back or to her face, ridiculing her. From the standpoint of gender equality, we believe that this is society's coldness and discrimination against women, and there is indeed a need to correct it.</p>
<p>I believe that "gender equality" is an immutable truth. Men can remarry, so why can't women? — Of course, those who voluntarily observe chastity for their husbands are not included in this example. Under certain circumstances, women's remarriage should not only not be criticized but even be encouraged. For example, after the end of World War I, women in the participating countries mostly remarried because their husbands had died on the battlefield. This was a common phenomenon. Therefore, women's remarriage is indeed something that should not be opposed, both in terms of humanity and national population.</p>
<p>In short, I do not advocate women's remarriage, but I absolutely sympathize with remarried women and will never despise or criticize them.</p>
<h3>American Mothers and Children</h3>
<p>— Yang Yongzhang</p>
<p>Someone wrote to the editor of an American medical journal asking him to answer two rather interesting questions.</p>
<p>First, the person asked, if there are two women, A and B, with A being older and B being younger, and they are both mothers, then which of the two will have taller and heavier babies? Second, this neurotic American also asked, are newborn babies in America now taller than those in the past, because he is afraid that Americans will gradually shrink.</p>
<p>The answer to the first question is not easy because there is too little research and reporting in this area. According to Ban Jiu's findings, Waner believes that in addition to the various circumstances during and after childbirth, the mother's age is also somewhat related to the child's growth. In general, babies born to mothers who are too young or too old have some shortcomings in health, but young mothers are better. Because women of older age may already be mothers of several children, the family burden is certainly heavier. Having another child means more expenses, and babies born at an older age are certainly in far worse economic conditions than those born early (when young). Whether in terms of nutrition or health care, it is detrimental to the child's growth. In fact, a child's health is closely related to the family's economy, and the relationship with the mother's age is relatively limited.</p>
<p>As for whether American children are shorter now than before, this is easy to solve. According to medical surveys and statistics, the height of American babies is not decreasing but continuing to increase. At the same time, they are more confident that the weight of the next generation of children will continue to increase.</p>
<p>Thinking of the mothers and children in small countries, it is truly pitiful. No one will pay attention to this small (?) problem, and of course, there is no way to answer it. Chinese women who are mothers, I wonder what your thoughts are?</p>
<h3>Children's Mental Health</h3>
<p>— Nian Ren</p>
<p>Ladies: Are you often troubled by your children's affairs? Or do you even lose your temper and scold or beat your children for some reason? Please stop doing that. Parents' every move is easily transmitted to their children. The saying "Tomorrow's children are today's selves" is not meant to be sensational. Of course, you definitely don't want to see your children behaving so unreasonably. Minor mistakes often lead to lifelong regrets. Now, I will write down some common abnormal behaviors of children on the left. Please observe whether your children have the same behaviors.</p>
<p>Timidity, stuttering, lying, truancy, shyness, stubbornness, mischief, aggressiveness, vanity, fantasy, eccentricity, fear of strangers, fear of darkness, temper tantrums, dependence on adults, or melancholy.</p>
<p>If they exhibit three or four of these, then your son (or daughter) is already a child with an unhealthy mind.</p>
<p>Although there is no need to worry excessively that these are incurable diseases, they should not be taken lightly, and you should not unintentionally allow them to grow and spread, leading to severe "hysteria" and personality disorders. These patients often become blind or paralyzed in certain parts of their body due to a little stimulation or tension. Are there any women in your neighborhood who like to cause trouble and argue? Does she often easily get angry with her husband? This is because she doesn't pay attention to mental health and gradually develops this annoying behavior from a young age. Small matters in the mind can have a significant impact on future career and social life. For example, if a child has a habit of shyness, they will be hesitant and conservative in the future, becoming a negative personality. Or, "stubbornness" can expand into cruelty and obstinacy, making them feared and hated by people.</p>
<p>And don't blame your children for being afraid of the dark. The result of severe scolding is the opposite of what you expect, it will only promote a cowardly nature in children and add another tricky problem. When children are two or three years old, when they are just learning to speak and entering kindergarten, their field of experience expands, so they often have situations that they can't cope with. At this time, it is easiest to cast some form of mental state. Especially children who are spoiled and overprotected by their parents, as soon as they enter a new environment, can develop abnormal behaviors of being at a loss, fearful and crying. But please don't just blame them for being useless, you must understand that the formation of behavior and personality is not a matter of one day or one night, and changing them is also not a matter of today or tomorrow. Intimidation and scolding have long been abandoned by educated people.</p>
<p>Therefore, we must never use emotional impulses to manage the psychological problems of children. Similarly, we must never cause them a kind of "emotional tension" abnormality when correcting their behavior. And we must analyze the child's behavior calmly and solve emotional difficulties. Here are three steps: (1) Observe and analyze abnormal behavior. (2) Make the child aware of his or her own shortcomings. (3) Suggest solutions and help them.</p>
<p>For example, to solve stuttering and fear of darkness, ridicule and anger are futile. Children who stutter are mostly under emotional disturbance and are very nervous, some even have convulsions. They cannot prevent persistent hesitation when speaking, or cannot control the repetition of words and syllables. If you laugh at him or imitate him, it will make him more uneasy emotionally. Therefore, he can often avoid stuttering in unfamiliar situations and try his best to control it. Therefore, first you must tell him the origin of stuttering, and then comfort him to speak slowly, and accurate speech can eliminate it, and at the same time, help him practice difficult words or phrases that are often mistaken, so that the emotional knot lurking in the depths can be slowly untied, and in this way, he can speak fluently.</p>
<p>The fear of darkness is relatively simple, it is mostly formed by alternating reactions. What does this mean! Children have had unpleasant and unsafe experiences in the dark, or in their parents' stories and conversations, they have learned that darkness is a symbol of fear and terror. It can also be eliminated by the method of alternating reactions. That is, in dark situations, give them pleasant and peaceful feelings, and gradually shift their existing prejudices.</p>

<h3>Door</h3>
<p>— Zhang Baihuai</p>
<p>In a dream, in the very center of the ideal map touched by my eyes, clear handwriting showed that there was such a magnificent golden house.</p>
<p>My conscious thoughts told me that this house contained a great deal of happiness, a great deal of warmth and joy, and, in addition, forever and ever, inexhaustibly, contained the pure and beautiful and loyal hearts of all good people.</p>
<p>So I felt extremely happy and laughed out loud. I thought this should be the most proud wealth of our world.</p>
<p>I wanted to walk over. I took a step and walked over.</p>
<p>However, the door was tightly locked.</p>
<p>I realized that this magnificent house might still have its own owner.</p>
<p>But I was determined to take out all the precious things inside, without any reservation, and then, I would fairly and impartially distribute them to those unfortunate, poor, unhappy, loveless, joyless, and pitiful children of our human race.</p>
<p>So I turned to thinking about a way to open the locked door.</p>
<p>I excitedly looked around. All around were people busy working, some for themselves—but more for everyone. They seemed not to know that there was such a golden house in the world, or, although they knew that there was such a golden house in the world, it was not something they could enjoy.</p>
<p>I thought: I might as well tell them!</p>
<p>"Friends!" I shouted, shouting with a fiery voice, "Do you know that there is a magnificent house in the world?"</p>
<p>They all looked up in astonishment, but none of them were willing to answer.</p>
<p>"That house contains the price and needs of all our efforts!" I shouted again, this time shouting with a voice of revelation.</p>
<p>But they just looked at each other silently, without the slightest sign of belief.</p>
<p>A slightly trembling voice floated over.</p>
<p>"That's right, that house, the house with the locked door..." It was a person saying to his companion, saying it very softly, so softly that only his companion and I could hear.</p>
<p>I immediately looked at him and smiled at him.</p>
<p>"But you, doesn't everyone have a good key?" I asked amiably.</p>
<p>"But it can't be done," the locked door, already... already rusted so that it can't be opened!" He said hesitantly, with a bit of self-abasement.</p>
<p>I was very disappointed and could not say anything more. I suddenly felt that these people were too cowardly and too kind, so they would always bear pain.</p>
<p>So I walked away. I thought I had to think of a way to open the locked door myself.</p>
<p>I certainly don't want to seize that shining, brilliant treasure. I want to take these shining treasures out and return them to these too kind and too timid and lovely people.</p>
<p>I jumped over a very wide ditch and walked into a very grand and bustling street. In every store on this street, the shop windows displayed keys of all kinds of strange styles.</p>
<p>I saw that the people here were competing for various colors of happiness, love, and joy as an appearance to show off their own wealth. They were bustling and jostling, and the air was filled with the strong fragrance of women's cosmetics.</p>
<p>I felt that this street was full of frivolity, insidiousness, greed, and extravagance. The people on this street, I noticed a little, and saw that they had long abandoned their pure and beautiful hearts.</p>
<p>I began to understand why those people who were busy working all day long retained their goodness, and I gradually realized why they had no happiness, no love, and could not see joy.</p>
<p>I thought: The people who are busy working have many, many pure and beautiful hearts, people's hearts, while the pedestrians on the street displaying all kinds of keys do not.</p>
<p>I thought: The pedestrians on the street displaying all kinds of keys have many, many happiness, people's happiness, but the people who are busy working have none at all.</p>
<p>Although I was thinking that among those various keys, there must be one that could open the door of that golden house, I did not go looking for it. I was afraid of being deceived by those who sold keys. They themselves are not necessarily able to open the locked door, otherwise they would definitely not lack that most important and indispensable thing. They flaunt their wealth, but they don't know how poor their souls are.</p>
<p>I still returned to the place where those lovely people were working. I was ashamed that I had not brought them a key. I just told them:</p>
<p>"Friends, in a house, a magnificent golden house, there are all the happy things we need.</p>
<p>"The lock on that door, although it cannot be opened, has already reached the point of being rusted and decayed. As long as, yes, as long as the thunder of truth sounds, it will be shattered on the threshold. At that time, be a little braver! Go in, those things belong to everyone, everyone in our new world should have them..."</p>
<p>I didn't finish speaking. Immediately, with a bang, followed by a muddy and dull sound that also spread out on the ground. Oh, a beam of colored light shot straight out from a magnificent house. Loud cheers vibrated my heart, which was so happy that tears streamed down. I turned over and saw that I was sitting on the bed, bathed in sunlight.</p>
<h3>A Dong</h3>
<p>— Yun Xi</p>
<p>A Dong was a maid in the second landlord Yang's house in Qilitang. Her two rolling eyes and a pair of oily little braids were equally lovely, but the wife thought that she was too light-boned, which was the fatal flaw of the subordinates. She came from Shaoxing Prefecture. In a certain year of great famine, she was sold to this village, and twenty silver dollars severed her connection with her own parents. Because she came in winter, she was called A Dong.</p>
<p>According to the old custom in the countryside, once a maid who was sold outright grew up, if she was not taken as a concubine by the master or young master, the owner would find a husband for her, give her some clothes as a gift, and send her into the arms of a strange man, which was considered to fulfill a wish, while sighing, "She just learned some life skills and then ran away!" At this time, there were probably already young candidates in line.</p>
<p>After enduring more than ten years of whipping and scolding, A Dong finally grew up to be very plump and needed the warmth of the opposite sex. She understood that what was in front of her was a major event related to her lifelong happiness. She vaguely saw the future joy, vaguely shining. At first, she yearned for it enthusiastically, but finally hesitated.</p>
<p>Two strong young men expressed their diligence to her at the same time. One was called Shougen, and the other was called Fachang. The two men were called to the Yang's house to do a few hours of short-term work during the busy farming season, so they both had the opportunity to get close to A Dong. In this regard, Shougen seemed to have a more superior position. Her mother worked as a maid in the third house of the Yang family. He often borrowed the reason to visit his old mother and talked a few more words with A Dong. He spoke shyly and bravely, appearing very honest and innocent. Fachang, like Shougen, was also a tenant of the Yang family, but his character was more lively, curious, and bold. He had traveled to several foreign ports and had a broad knowledge. All his conversations and gestures were naturally superior to Shougen's, making it easier to attract a young woman who was fantasizing. A Dong's attitude gradually became clear between the two men who originally had equal hope, leaning towards the more humorous one.</p>
<p>The second master and second wife seemed to have an attitude of non-interference in this matter. The master thought that both Shougen and Fachang were not bad. Although Fachang was more pleasing, he did not necessarily want A Dong to marry Fachang. As for the wife, she simply didn't have time to think about such trivial matters. She was an optimist. When she was happy, she laughed and giggled, lay down on the bed and smoked a few pipes of opium, and slept comfortably. When she was unhappy, she scolded the servants and maids head-on, lay down on the bed and smoked a few pipes of opium, and still slept comfortably.</p>
<p>However, this was not a trivial matter for Shougen's mother, Aunt Chen. We have to understand that a widow who only left behind an only son after her husband's death often faced economic constraints, and at the same time, the desire to hold a grandson occupied the first position in her heart. Although in the countryside, it still required a considerable expense to marry a daughter-in-law through a formal marriage. Her wise eyes had long placed her expectations for the second half of her life on A Dong. However, according to the current development of the situation, wouldn't the good dream that she had worked so hard to weave be completely broken?</p>
<p>So she looked forward to the arrival of Aunt Hedong.</p>
<p>Aunt Hedong was an outstanding matchmaker, an indispensable figure in the village and town. She was diligent, good at talking, good at pretending to smile, and quick in her movements. Although she came from a humble background, she could enter and exit large households everywhere and win the welcome of both superiors and subordinates. She occasionally brought some gifts, such as two chicks or half a jar of pickles. When she returned home, the basket was usually heavier than when she went out. The setting sun painted her face red, and her heart was particularly light.</p>
<p>On this day, Aunt Hedong arrived. Aunt Chen received her with extra care, brewing tea three times in a row. Aunt Hedong was surprised, but she didn't want to ask first, so she pretended to be nonchalant and talked about the happy event of the Huang family in the town the day before: the bride was pretty, but there were more freckles on her face; the master and wife often quarreled, the wife wanted to have a big scene and liked to give more money to the subordinates, but the master always wanted to deduct some, saying that spending money was like shaving water slices, and saving a few would save a few, ... while exploring Aunt Chen's facial expressions, she marveled at the other party's patience. Fortunately, Aunt Chen finally opened her mouth timidly.</p>
<p>"Mom, I won't hide it from you, I have something on my mind that I want to ask you to do."</p>
<p>"You can say it, my old body can do its best, how can I not help you." Aunt Hedong immediately catered up.</p>
<p>"It's also about marriage, our Shougen has reached the age."</p>
<p>"Yes, it's time to get a wife. Fortunately, Shougen is an honest and stable person, otherwise, at this age, he would have been sniffing and drilling around like a dog. - Who are you interested in, I'll go and talk to them for you."</p>
<p>"Mom, you are a discerning person, you can see clearly, I don't need to say it."</p>
<p>"I really don't know."</p>
<p>A Dong in the second master's room, and also</p>
<p>"Oh-" Mom finally couldn't help but giggle; this... then you should... you should set up a voice with the second master and wife, wouldn't that be done"</p>
<p>"How can I say it myself, besides-" she paused, and then told her difficulties one by one. Aunt Hedong was an extremely good person, so of course she agreed readily.</p>
<p>"This matter depends entirely on you!"</p>
<p>"Don't be so polite, what is it to help each other as family members, I'll definitely mention it when I go to the second master's house later."</p>
<p>The two sat side by side on the low stool behind the stove, the firewood illuminating their wrinkled faces with smiles, and their hearts were as warm as fire.</p>
<p>Aunt Hedong came to the second house, and the wife was enjoying the opium. Mom sat down on the bed with her butt, repeated talking about the Huang family's happy event in the town, and roundaboutly led to the main topic, and then gave full play to it.</p>
<p>"To be honest, I don't care," the wife yawned lazily, "I'll ask the master back, as long as he agrees, I have no objection." Saying that, she loaded a pipe of opium.</p>
<p>"But I want the wife to look at my old woman's face and say a good word in front of the master."</p>
<p>"Okay, my wife is good at helping, she won't not help, ... but, to be honest with you, marrying a maid, small scattered items, there are a few anyway, and there are a few clothes, but it's not as good as the young lady, it can't be like a proper one." The wife's tone suddenly became serious.</p>
<p>"Hey, what are you talking about, wife, she is asking for a person, not goods, as long as the master and wife agree, even if she comes over with just a stick, Aunt Chen will be satisfied."</p>
<p>"Okay, you sit for a while, when the master comes back, you talk to him."</p>
<p>"Yes, but I still have to ask the wife to help!" Aunt Hedong giggled again.</p>
<p>The master was hesitant at first, and then raised small objections, but he couldn't stand Aunt Hedong's river-like argumentation, a series of requests that had to be agreed to, and his heart softened. The wife also lived up to her trust, and from time to time, one or two jiaoyu flew out from the smoke, for example:</p>
<p>"Shougen's house is just across the river, and it will be convenient to exchange things in the future."</p>
<p>"I said that Fachang is very active, maybe he'll abduct his wife, and run to a foreign country with a pipe of opium, and even forget the owner."</p>
<p>"Although Aunt Chen is a maid in the third brother's house, we often send her to do errands, and we should give her this benefit."</p>
<p>The master chuckled twice and said:</p>
<p>"Okay, it's up to you, I didn't say that A Dong must belong to Fachang."</p>
<p>At that moment, Aunt Hedong excitedly turned her little feet and summoned A Dong to come in, and the master and wife seriously announced her husband's name. Then she habitually asked, "How do you feel?"</p>
<p>A Dong was stunned and didn't say a word, as if struck by lightning. Finally, she rubbed her eyes and slowly walked out, but hid in her own bedroom and sobbed.</p>
<p>The master was worried: a woman, she has to marry a husband sooner or later, what is she crying about? He cleared his throat and scolded, "Rotten skin, dare to cry! If you cry again, I'll send you to the underworld!" The wife was calm, grabbed the master's agitated shoulder and quietly persuaded, "Why get so angry, girls are narrow-minded and can't see through, she'll be fine after a cry."</p>
<p>Aunt Hedong was soft-hearted after all and felt sorry. She personally visited A Dong's small room and used the spirit of government officials to enlighten a revolutionary traitor to persuade this weeping woman.</p>
<p>"Oh! Don't you think, the master and wife are also doing it for your own good! Fachang is lively, but it's hard to say if he's really reliable. He runs outside a lot, has seen a lot of the world, and is active, it's hard to guarantee that there won't be any trouble! ... As the old saying goes, smart people make mistakes, but Shougen is the kind of person who is honest and reliable for life... Marry a chicken, follow a chicken, marry a dog, follow a dog, you have to plan for the long term! ..."</p>
<p>A Dong wiped her tears with the back of her hand, gradually raised her chin, glanced at Aunt Hedong blankly, then shifted her gaze and stared blankly at the ten or so running chicks in the courtyard, without saying a word.</p>
<p>"Besides, Aunt Lian is the most amiable person, and she only has one son, there's nothing to fight for in the family, if there's anything, the three of them can talk it over... There are houses and fields, enough to eat and keep warm, what else do you want?"</p>
<p>Strangely, A Dong suddenly sobbed again.</p>
<p>"Oh dear, why are you crying again, what else can't you let go of? ... You have to be obedient, don't be so stubborn, you know the master's temper, if you obey him smoothly, he will treat you well, if you make trouble, he will insist on you doing what he says, and in the end you still have to obey him, why not listen to him early and make everyone happy. ..."</p>
<p>Although she didn't get to the point of being exhausted, Aunt Hedong certainly spent a lot of effort. Fortunately, where there is a will, there is a way, A Dong really changed her mind, and under Aunt Hedong's urging, she nodded slightly, expressing her submission.</p>
<p>Aunt Hedong was overjoyed and immediately took the good news to Aunt Chen. The two then asked the third master to check the calendar and choose a good day, and sent a gift to the second house as an engagement.</p>
<p>Aunt Chen was eager to have a grandson, and the auspicious wedding day was set for this winter. Although the second wife thought it was too tight, she sighed and agreed. Shougen and A Dong were shy and tried their best to avoid meeting each other. Aunt Chen's face also seemed to turn tender, and she felt embarrassed in front of A Dong.</p>
<p>As for Fachang, he suddenly became extremely silent, his mouth seemed to be locked. After that, it was difficult to come to Yang's house. I don't know how, he was suddenly taken away by dysentery.</p>
<p>Aunt Hedong praised her good eyesight to everyone she met. She said:</p>
<p>"I had already determined that Fachang's philtrum was born short, and he wouldn't live long. I advised A Dong not to marry him, he's so young, being a widow, what's the joy? ... Fortunately, A Dong was obedient after all and was willing to listen to me, wasn't she? Now it's verified."</p>
<p>Everyone thought it was right, and the pain in A Dong's heart also subsided. She had nothing to repay, so she worshiped Aunt Hedong as her adoptive mother.</p>

<h3>Double Flying, Double Dwelling (64)</h3>
<p>— Zhao Qingge</p>
<p>Twelve</p>
<p>Mrs. Mo, like an ant on a hot pan, was anxious to make her dream a reality, so under the encouragement of many people, and through Shi Yulou's introduction, she finally decided to let Lihua take the stage for three days starting from New Year's Day! Zhang Xian and the theater manager agreed that these three days would be on a "bubble" (ticket meaning) basis, without any remuneration. If it was successful, she would officially go into the business after three days, and then discuss remuneration. At the same time, Liyun would also take the stage for a trial performance. Zhang Xian arranged the repertoire for the three days for them. Lihua's first day was "The Dragon Travels and Plays with the Phoenix"; the second day was "Female Escort"; and the third day was "Teaching the Son." Liyun's first day was "Catching and Releasing Cao"; the second day was "Yellow Crane Tower"; and the third day was a duet with Lihua in "Teaching the Son." Lihua's play was scheduled as the third act in the front, and Liyun's was the second.</p>
<p>Once the principles were decided, Zhang Xian hurried to teach them to review these plays they had learned, and also held a rehearsal. Needless to say, Lihua always performed better than Liyun in the rehearsal. Whether it was singing or acting, Lihua would understand it with just one listen and one look; Liyun, however, had to listen many times and look many times, and then learn many times before she could understand. Even then, she was not proficient. Therefore, Zhang Xian often scolded Liyun: it's bad enough that you don't have talent, but you don't even try. But Lihua also didn't try hard. Lihua's success depended entirely on her talent and intelligence. Apart from satisfying her thirst for knowledge by privately reading the scripts like books, she rarely practiced the technical aspects of acting on her own initiative. Strangely enough, even though she didn't practice, she didn't forget anything. This amazed Zhang Xian! He wanted to make things difficult for her, but he couldn't bring himself to; he was secretly pleased, but he didn't dare to provoke her easily.</p>
<p>Lihua had already learned more than ten complete plays, and had also learned some supporting roles' parts. She now treated learning opera as an obligation she had to fulfill to Mrs. Mo and Zhang Xian. She fulfilled her required courses with tears in her eyes every day. She no longer defied Mrs. Mo and Zhang Xian in everything they wanted her to do; she knew that defiance was useless. So during rehearsals, she mechanically allowed everyone to arrange her, without uttering a word. Usually, apart from when she had to speak when learning opera, she didn't talk much. She ignored Zhang Xian, didn't talk much to Mrs. Mo, and even rarely played with Liyun. She became more taciturn and introverted, sitting quietly in the room all day long like a grown-up girl, either reading books or doing needlework. The innocence of her childhood had left her far, far behind!</p>
<p>Liyun, however, was still so cheerful. If she didn't learn the opera well and was beaten and bullied, she would cry for a while, but then forget about it. Especially these days, she was very happy because Second Mrs. Weng was coaxing her, telling her to study opera diligently so that she could make her beautiful clothes and buy foreign dolls for the New Year. On the day of the rehearsal, she felt a very strong interest! She wore a gauze hat, a blue robe, and a pair of high-soled boots, and she even had a long beard hanging from her chest. She was simply overjoyed! She had transformed from someone not yet ten years old into an old man. This was the first time she had played like this, and she hoped to be able to play like this often in the future. Because she regarded singing opera as play, she neglected the artistic aspects of learning. But she had one advantage, which was that she was not stage-frightened or shy. When others watched her during rehearsals, she didn't care at all, as if she didn't know there was anyone else there. She was so bold and shameless, and when the gongs and drums sounded, she sang even more enthusiastically than usual. Even if you said she wasn't good.</p>
