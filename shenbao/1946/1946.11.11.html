<h3>延安發表聲明反對召開國大</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京十日電〕據延安九日廣播，共產黨中共發言人廖承志發表聲明。大意謂：「蔣介石氏於十一月八日發表聲明，決定召開其一手包辦的所謂國民大會，以通過其所謂「憲法」，表明中國的局勢，比以前更爲嚴重。同時又宣布了一次所謂停戰令，此次停戰令和歷次的一樣，不是什麼停戰令，而是繼續大打的作戰令」。繼謂，如果蔣氏欲證明他對和平具有誠意，那麼他就應當：（一）下令停開一黨包辦的所謂國大，按照政協決議的內容和程序，在各黨派協商的基礎上，召開民主的國大。（二）將侵入解放區的軍隊撤出去，並停止調動軍隊，恢復一月間第一次停戰令的位置。共產黨聲明，凡屬以眞和平爲目的之商談，我們均願參加，凡屬欺騙行爲，我們一槪反對。</p>

<h3>社論　日本賠償問題的檢討</h3>
<p>盟國管制日本委員會定於明日開會，討論將日本資產及財產作爲償付盟國賠款之分配問題。據法國新聞社倫敦八日電，美國國務院早已邀請遠東委員會各會員國，與美國政府通行談判，討論此一問題；同時并希望各國對於下列兩個問題；（一）關於將日本資產百分之十五至廿作爲賠款，立即分配問題；（二）關於其餘資產百分之八十至八十五最後分配問題。提出建議，經遠東委員會通過後，即將提交盟國最高統帥麥克阿瑟元帥，付諸實施。所以這幾天來，日本賠償問題及其資產如何分配？又成爲世人注意的焦點了。</p>
<p>日本侵略中國，是第二次大戰的導火綫；其後，日本又乘英美不備，突然襲擊珍珠港及新加坡，揭開太平洋戰爭的血幕，所以日本是這次大戰的禍首罪魁，應與納粹德國負起同樣的罪責，是無可疑義的。聯合國要日本償付一筆鉅大的賠償，雖非由於報復的心理，但是終覺得對於日本的挑釁以致釀成滔天大禍，應該予以嚴峻的懲罰。同時除了懲罰的作用而外，還有一層最重的作用，就是要藉此以限制日本戰力的復興，以防日本侵略勢力的東山再起，又在遠東引起新的戰爭。這是聯合國對於日本一致的要求，本來是沒有問題的；但是賠款怎樣計算？因爲各國對日作戰所受的損失，不論在政府方面或人民方面，均難作精確的計算；同時各國所受的損失，又各不相同，實在沒有一個客觀的標準。再加以戰敗後的日本，究有多少償付賠款的能力？也是一個嚴重的問題。例如第一次大戰後的德國賠款問題，經過二十多年的討論，仍沒有獲得一個解決的方法；再如第二次大戰後的德國賠款問題，至今尚無眉目。所以今日的日本賠償問題，并不是一個簡單的問題。實在有值得我們研究的價值。</p>
<p>在對日作戰期受有重大損失的國家，首推中美英蘇四國。要求日本賠償，要求日本將其資產作爲償付賠款之用，四國的意見是完全一致的，決無其他的問題。但是在如何分配方面，各國的意見就不相同了，尤其在美蘇兩國之間。美蘇兩國當局有鍳於斯，在去年十二月間英美蘇三國外長在莫斯科開會之際，便決定設立一遠東委員會，即由中·英·美·法·蘇·荷蘭·加拿大·澳洲·印度·菲律賓暨紐西蘭等十一國組成，負有「製訂日本於完全履行投降條件時應恪遵之政策，原則以及標準。」解決日本賠償問題，當然也是遠東委員會的任務之一。惟因蘇聯搬走中國的東北及朝鮮的日本工業設備，致使美蘇兩國對於日本賠償問題，發生齷齪，在蘇聯方面，認爲日本的工業設備，是蘇聯的「戰利品」，不能仍視爲日本的資產，作爲償付賠款之用；但是美國方面，卻堅持蘇聯在中國的東北及朝鮮搬走的日本物資，不能視爲「戰利品」，而仍應視爲日本的資產，在蘇聯就得的賠款內，應該扣除這一筆物資。同時美國又派了杜魯門總統的賠款專員鮑萊，前來中國的東北及朝鮮，調查蘇聯所搬走的物資，且已有一張完全的清單。此外，鮑萊又於本年五月間，致函麥帥，主張日人在中國東北及朝鮮之資產，仍保留在原處，作爲賠償各該國之用。鮑萊此舉，顯然珍對蘇聯而發生，因此蘇聯即拒不參加日本賠償委員會，致使遠東委員會，也很難展開工作。</p>
<p>至於我國對於日本賠款，雖然尚未正式提出要求，但在原則上早已決定：即「我國抗戰最久，損害最重，日本對盟國之賠償，我國自應享有優越之比額與優先受償之權利。政府應按照此項原則，提出整個賠償方案，對於盟國行將設立：賠償機構，更應獲得有力之參加，以求我國賠償要求之實現」。本年九月間廿一國和會在巴黎舉行時，我國王外長世杰，對於日本賠償問題，曾作率直的表示：他說「中國在戰時雖蒙受重大損失，但不提出超過日本償付能力之賠款要求。」這種開明與寬大的態度，曾獲得各國的注意與重視，聞中國政府業已撰就縝密方案，將向日本賠償委員會提出，其內容大抵謂：中國在對日作戰期間所受損失最重，自七七事變起，至戰爭結束時止，中國公私物資的損失，總計四五百萬萬美元之鉅，此數尚不包括生命死傷及軍費在內，因此中國要求將來在日本對盟國賠款總額內，至少應得百分之四十，以充戰後重新建設之用。這個方案，實在最公允也沒有了，必能獲得有關各國的同情與採納。</p>
<p>由上所述，解決日本賠償問題，實已刻不容緩了，萬萬不能再拖延下去；戰敗後的日本，日夜在猛晋之中，不到一年的工夫，已由復員時期進入復興階段。據美國調查日本工業組合代表團的報告，日本財閥仍控制龐大財富及經濟權力之工業組合制度，其在國內經濟上勢力之大，爲任何資本主義工業化國家所望塵莫及，故其潛勢力的存留不去，即不足以防製日本戰爭工業潛力的復活，這一個駭人聽聞的報告，使日本賠償問題更有早獲解決的必要。據美國外交界人士的猜測，將來遠東委員會討論此一問題，如陷於僵局，則此一問題將提交四國外長會議討論，屆時中國也得派遣代表參加。由此固然也可知美國當局也迫切期望這個問題的解決，但是瞻望前途，實在未容樂觀。所以我們不得不在這裏，大聲疾呼，籲請美蘇兩國的政治外交家，均能運用大智大能，使這個問題早日獲得公允合理的解決，替遠東和平的大計，奠定一個最鞏固的基礎。切勿目光如豆，自私自利，隻看見自己的利益，而不知道以遠東和平爲重，處處與他國爭利，不惜使其陷於僵局，徒然有利於日本經濟的復興，使其潛勢力再有捲土重來的可能。所謂杜漸防微，盟國對之不可不早爲之計。美國主張先將日本資產百分之十五至廿立即分配，而將其餘的百分之八十至八十五，日後再議分配的辦法，我們終覺得「尚嫌不夠」。</p>
<h3>留學策政的檢討</h3>
<p>日前教育部公費自費留學生考試揭曉，社會一般關心教育人士，於是又討論到留學政策的得失。最近教育部發言人，又以新聞記者發表有關留學政策的談話，略以大戰八年，歐美學術，日進千里，其突飛猛進之情勢，遠非吾人所能想像，起急直追，趕上時代，須從兩方面着手，一面應積極充實我大學設備，謀根本解決，一而亦應選派青年可造之才，出國學習。「但如漫無限制，則有錢人之子弟，均可自由出國，必將發生流弊。」教育部就國家民族建設大計着想，對社會關心此事，提出意見，表示歡迎，願意虛心考慮。這種坦白率真的態度，值得我們的讚佩。</p>
<p>首先我們感覺到現在還要討論到留學政策的問題，實是一件遺憾的事。中國之派遣留學生遠在七十年前，伍廷芳，唐紹儀，週壽臣，詹天佑，嚴復之　都在這個早期出洋留學，而直到如今我國在學術方面遠趕不上人家，以致有「歐美學術，日進千里，其突飛猛進之情勢，遠非吾人所能想像」的現象，這真使我們感到萬分慚愧，人家突飛猛進的情勢，我們連想像的資格也沒有，寗勿令人　　　　　初派遣留學生到歐美去學習以至現在的七十年間，我們在教育學術方面，不是沒有成績，而我們到今天卻還要討論到留學政策的問題，寗不遺憾！</p>
<p>留學，從其本質上言，實是一种恥辱，這是一國學術教育落後的徵象，等到一國的學術教育發達以後，應該沒有大批學生出洋留學的現象，日本與我們同時有歐美留學生的派遣，到了後來，我們反要派遣學生留學日本。十九世紀的美國人，也有以留學歐洲爲殊榮的，可是等到美國大學及學術教育發達後，此風便即衰頽。我們現在之尚需派遣學生留學歐美，表示我國的學術教育未臻發達，應該是一件可恥的事，然而大批學生的出洋留學，卻是事實。教育部爲管理學生的出國留學，限制極嚴，且須經過嚴格的考試及格後始能出國，此其用意，固屬無可非議；但此項限制的結果，卻使一般有志出國不願經過考試的人，或經過考試而落弟的人，不得不另謀別法，於是流弊百出，凡此均爲事實，不容掩飾；所以我們此際來檢討一下我國留學政策的得失，要非無益。</p>
<p>關於留學生的出國，我們必須指出若干重要的幾點：第一教育部的發言人說：「但如漫無限制，則有錢人之子弟，均可自由出國，必將發生流弊。」我們不明白，是否留學管制政策的採取，是在使「有錢人之子弟，均不得自由出國，以免發生流弊。」有錢人之子弟和流弊有什麼關係？的確，有錢人子弟不免染有紈袴習氣者，但如以染有紈袴習氣者，均爲有錢人之子弟，卻未必一定是事實。有錢人子弟豈無孜孜於學的人？因此，留學的管制，決不應因有錢無錢而有區別。第二，我們還得承認這一宗事實，就是管制愈嚴，流弊愈多。富有或具有勢力者子弟，可以不經考試，假借各種不同名義，或使用各種不同方法，依舊達到出國留學的目的。此其結果，無寗說在助長作偽的惡風，抑制了志行純潔的好學青年。</p>
<p>所以我們懷疑國家對留學采取管制政策是否爲得計。在這個時候，假如國家采取嚴格的管理政策，不許學生自由出國，而同時國內的大學教育又不積極改進充實，則無異自己斲傷了民族的元氣。這是爲此，噹我們看到教育部發言人對留學政策所發表的談話，而感到欣慰；因爲教育部也看到應積極充實我大學設備，以謀根本解決的必要；同時亦應選派青年可造之才，出國學習。這裏，問題在是選派上；考試及格的人，是否均是真才，落北的是否皆屬不堪造就。如果落弟的亦有堪以造就之才，那末，則於嚴格之中，應該有變通補救之方，庶幾作偽的頽風可以稍止，真才不致見棄。若果操之偏激，則嚴格管制結果，未必一定能如預期的理想；樹人事業，誠如教育部發言所云，應就國家民族建設大計着想，而不應該感情用事的。等到我國的學術教育發達了以後，留學制度也可不必取締而自行消滅。爲了我們的國家民族，願皆能夠早日來到。</p>

<h3>身懷絕技犯案纍纍　山東飛賊燕子李三　在濟南三度落網</h3>
<p>〔本報濟南訊〕飛賊李盛武（燕子李三），在淪陷時即混跡濟南，住居東關靑龍街，四年之中，在濟槍殺三命，歷偸富室金店。勝利時曾被捕，不幸在起解途中被李兎脫，旋在大觀園內豫生東土膏店一露身手，迄今一年來逍遙法外，終於本月四日下午九時，在本市館驛街茂來棧內被捕。記者震於這位橫行大江南北，犯案纍纍之飛賊李盛武的大名，爲了明白他的眞象，特於五日訪逮捕李的警察局偵緝隊長李希孟，當蒙引入楊隊長的辦公室內，恰巧這時正在審訊，就在楊的辦公室內，見到這個身懷絕技的人物。李盛武是中等身材，長圓面孔，祗戴着一頂黑色睡帽，穿着一身黑色短衣，談話是山東禹城的口音，兩眼灼灼生光，神情是那樣自如地坐在沙發上，聽楊隊長詳細的訊問，李是很從容回答。</p>
<p>關外學藝初試身手</p>
<p>據李盛武說：他今年二十六歲，山東禹城李家莊人，小時曾進過私塾，唸了幾年書，終因生性頑劣，過不慣那樣刻板的生活，遂離開家庭，隻身跑到哈爾濱。到十二歲時，遇到一位奇人，即拜他——奇人爲師，一共師兄弟三人，一個姓胡，二個姓吳，他——李盛武是第三，後來江湖上「燕子李三」，就是由取的綽號。到了十六歲，武藝學成，師兄弟三人即結伴闖蕩江湖，在東北九省各大都市碼頭施展絕藝，正式下海——偸盜。在民國廿二年，便一同進入關內，在大江南北各地活動，前後不知作過多少巨案，全憑一身武藝，始終沒有栽過，燕子李三的名字更加呌響。後來那兩位兄都相繼死去，剩下孤身一人，仍然幹着這無本錢的勾當，直到卅二年方來到濟南。</p>
<p>過去兩次被捕經過</p>
<p>在濟南四年的工夫，犯案很多，一時也不淸了。主要的對象都是金店富戶，除去金銀現鈔及貴重品外，一槪不取。現在所能想到的，如三十三年在新恒利金店，偸去赤金三十多兩，不幸被城內西區警察分局偵知，被捕解送法院，判了半年徒刑。越獄逃出以後，在三十四年九月初間，又參經二路美最時鐘表行，偸過鋼筆等物四十餘件，現鈔四十萬元事後到了舊屑八月初一，被偵緝隊薛立文張壽亭等查出綫索，尾隨到車關東靑龍街沈家胡同三十八號（係李典的房子），這是第二次被捕。當時手上套着兩付洋銬並綁在人力車上，預備往總局押解，自想犯案太重，所以時思脫逃，當洋車由東關走到縣東巷北頭東西菜園子的時候，趁押解人一時失神的機會，乃挺身躍上民房，又得逃走。</p>
<p>槍殺三命心狠手辣</p>
<p>從此對薛立文（捕他的偵緝隊員）便懷恨在心，預備隨時隨地希圖報復，到了三十五年五月間，某一天的中午，暗帶手槍，去到小王府街薛立文家裏，託言有事拜訪，恰巧薛有事出外，便坐在屋裏等候，一直吸完了兩盒前門香烟，還不見薛立夫回來，實在不耐煩，於是就拿出手槍，把他的祖母母親兩人齊開槍打死，並且把三粒子彈壳給他留在桌子上，用意在呌薛知道我的厲害。這件事情，大槪除了薛自己之外知道的非常詳細，所以從此後李老頭時常拿此做爲要挾，向我要些錢花，我當時再三思考，認爲常此一往，難免他不向外人洩漏，遂決心把李老頭殺死，在某一天的晚上，領着李老頭出外蹓躂，從鵲華橋走到南關南城墻根，當時見四下無人，即在舊軍門巷口上，開槍把李老頭打死，一共打了他五槍，我依然再走到商埠，第二天便回禹城去了。</p>
<p>在大觀園開槍拒捕</p>
<p>記得還有一天，我穿着鐵路職工的黃色制服，懷了一枝南飛式手槍，到大觀園豫生東土膏店吸食雅片，（據聞當時李在土膏店內認識了一雙姊妹花），本來這枝手槍是張××的，打算由我轉交給偽警備隊聶隊長的，不料就在這吸烟的時候，聽見外面人聲嘈雜，茶房高聲向大家囑咐着不要驚慌，查土膏店的來了，忽然發現茶房的身後已經隨着幾個雄糾糾的漢子，正是偵緝隊的人馬到來，當即丟下烟槍，掏出手槍，一般偵緝員雖已進到烟榻近前，但看見我舉着手槍，他們就轉身跑出來了，我匆匆的拿着衣服，奔向廚房逃去，再從廚房上登高，越過幾家民房，走到大觀園北首，順着一家蓋房子搭好了的架子，走到緯二路，又被脫逃。</p>
<p>左腿負傷終落法網</p>
<p>前幾天我由宴城又回到濟南，預備買點雜貨回去做買賣，住在館驛街茂來棧東屋裏，因爲店主東是我舊識，由我鄕親李思同介紹的朋友。但以行縱詭密，終被偵緝隊偵破，遂在前天，在嚴密的包圍下，使我這隻插翅虎左腿負傷，不能再騰身上房，施其故技，而加上鐐銬，押進了國法的鐵檻。</p>

<h3>臨大補習班學生處理經過</h3>
<p>—教育部來函對該班學生總答復—</p>
<p>逕啓者；本部爲救濟收復區專科以上學校學生學業起見，前在北平，靑島，南京，上海，武漢，瀋陽等處，設置臨時大學補習班，收錄偽專科以上學校肄業學生，予以補習甄審，補習期滿學生操行成績優良甄審成績合於下列標準者，由部予以分發學校。</p>
<p>（一）修習補習課程及基本課程各科成績均及格者，升級分發。</p>
<p>（二）專修補習課程各科成績在七十五分以上者，及加修基本課程學生成績有一科不及格或基本課程有二科不及格而補習課程各科成績均在七十五分以上者，留級分發。</p>
<p>其不合於上述條件者不予分發，仍應自行投考學校。早經本部訂定各臨時大學補習班補習期滿學生結業考試分發辦法，通飭各班知照。北平，靑島，上海，南京，武漢，等補習期滿學生均已先後經部審核分發。至武漢臨時大學補習班學生，僅修習總理遺教及主席言論，國文，英文，中國歷史，中國地理並就大代數及代數，解析幾何及幾何，哲學槪論，法學，通論，生物，物理，化學，微積分入門中選修一門或二門，（亦有未選習者），該班保送免試升學學生七十七人，經部審核學歷不實或偽造證件者十五人，原校並非大學程度或入班資格不合者五人，未繳證件或證件有問題者五人，原校均已開學應返原校者四十八人，（其中少數原校學歷亦有問題）另予分發學校者五人，其餘成績不合標準各生，照章仍應自行投考學校，依所塡學歷，其中可返原校者亦達六十八人。惟近有一部份學生，用武漢臨時大學請願團（本部僅有補習班並未設有此種大學）名義，散發印刷品，並在各報送登呼籲文件。本部分發學生升學，係依照原定辦法辦理。凡學業成績並非優良各生，自應加倍努力硏習，以備再行投考學校。至學歷不實或偽造證件等少數學生，其學籍照章本不能予以承認。恐社會人士，不明眞象，相應函請查照，希將原函刋登讀者意見欄爲荷。（教育部高等教育司啓）</p>
<h3>公務員工作情緒觀</h3>
<p>記得在某次的集會上，我們縣長曾在報吿中有這樣的一段話「日來本府工作效能非但無有進步，抑且在無形中退步，若每天的辦公時間大都不能按照規定上午辦公是七時半，往往至九時辦公室中尚無人到，在下辦公是五時半，往往未至五時都已散去」在這段話中深深地感覺到那爲什麼這樣的馬虎呢，胡縣長何嘗不明瞭，究竟主要的原因是待遇太並，及管理乏人，使辦事沒有精神沒有情緒，大家都是抱着過了一天算一天的思想。講到待遇，那是實在可憐，以縣級論，平均高級職員每人月入七萬元（自膳），低級職員每人月入五萬元（自膳），公役月入二萬五千元（自膳），則外面的物價已是一日千里，縣長在每次集會上總是說要竭力設法提高待遇，而實際上還需要財政當局認爲財政收支平衡，財政能寬裕，則可眞眞的改善，否則結果還是畫餅充不得飢。老是說；照現在物價漫無止境的疾駛着，和我們收入極微的數字下，就是立刻給我們加上一倍，也是弄不好，這幾個錢拿來作什麼用呢？</p>
<p>至於我們的伙食，更可憐得不用說，每天所吃的，實在亳無營養價値—國爲待遇和生活的逼人，所以近來離開的很多，實在守株待兎，亳無希望！最可憐的是我們低級職員，對工作上付出最大努力，所享受的酬勞，遠不及勞工！不過我們希望賢明的當局，給我們小職員着想改善，所謂惻隱之心人皆有之啊！（金家驤）</p>
<h3>行李逾量處罰慘重</h3>
<p>我等都是有識業的人，被強暴的日寇，無理侵略，使我等失業，現雖日寇投降，國共未和，一般的工商仍不復業，爲了生活，不得不做如牛馬般的小販。但有幾件疑問，我等所知隨身行李（一）每人可帶廿公斤，過了廿公斤，要補行李票。（二）行李票是由俗稱「黑帽子」管理，（三）補行李票有收據爲憑。但嘉善站是相反的，行李票是由路警管理的，不到廿公斤要行李票一張（四千元）。過了廿公斤，沒有行李票，要罰一萬二萬三萬元不等，但無收據。唉！這樣被罰數萬元後，我等要白走三四次！回憶敵偽時，做小販過軋票收票都要「買路綫」。今已是勝利了，雖無「買路綫」，要罰無理，如何說得通！鐵路當局不可不嚴予制止！（嘉善小販褚奎興·凌錢氏·李平華·陸陳氏·張雲才·徐文珍·王如羽·傅倚芳·陳晋慶·沈四寳）</p>
<h3>倒馬桶時間官提早</h3>
<p>南市民國路大境路附近一帶，每晨九時左右，糞車陳列街道，臭氣四溢；路人掩鼻而過，不但妨碍商店營業，而且影響交通秩序，况上海爲國際觀瞻，實有傷衛生要旨，倘提早倒馬桶時間，旣可减少上述缺點，復使市民提倡早起之健康習慣，傳聞本市近日實行淸潔運動，是則衛生當局對於是項問題，殊有値得考慮一下。（周五行）</p>
<h3>垃圾拋棄路旁了事</h3>
<p>鄙人於今午行經凱旋路火車站附近時，見一裝載垃圾之卡車，（號碼爲滬三〇二四五號）將滿車汚物，倒於路旁空道理？希望有關當局注意。（張立）</p>

<p>汪杰君：來函請救復職一事，頃由京滬區鐵路管理局運務處復稱：「查該讀者原充偽華鐵常州站職工，並於敵偽時期受傷成爲殘廢，本路接收後，因其傷久未愈，乃予解僱，並無別情。」特達。</p>

<h3>艾德禮發表演說　英次爲和平努力　普遍安全未樹立仍須保持實力　解決德國問顯爲歐洲繁榮所繫</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦九日電〕艾德禮首相今日在傳統的倫敦市長宴會中致辭，聲明英國具有綱續向其和平目標進發，並解除世界人民霞大之軍備負担之決心。首相述及聯合國機構時，特別着重主權之移轉一點。復日，德國問題之獲得滿意解決，爲歐洲和平與繁榮所必要。此外更鄭重聲明，在世界方正重樹安全與信任心理之期，英國必須維持其防禦力量，保持國家之強大。其言有謂，英政府對國內以及共和邦與帝國之人民，負有黨大之責任，在來曾護得更確切之安全，以替代目前之現象以前，政府不能免除此種責任。</p>
<p>對聯洽國懷抱希望</p>
<p>本人相信許多人對聯合國之運用方式，均感失望，由於會塲由無理抨擊與阻撓，使整個機權陷入不信任之狀態中，吾人可以斷言，若以聯台國機構作爲辯論偏見之塲合，則必歸失敗無疑，必頭能使談一機稱得以保障各國之省由安全及其生活方式，一方面作有利於整個世界之貢獻，始可使聯合國機構成功。吾人認爲於討論每一問題時，必先自問「此一解決辦法能有助於和平與諒解之足進乎？」本人相信世界每一角港之人民，莫不禾望實得和平與裁車，使世界之客項問題，得依此項基礎而解決。</p>
<p>行動表現忍受指責</p>
<p>職是之故，我友貝文外相無論在聯合國會議中，招待記者時或廣播演說時，均盡力進免對攻擊英國者旅以答復，蓋與其以言辭答覆，不如以事實表現也。我國在印度緬甸及殖民帝國他處之打動，可絨顯示不列顛帝國與共和邦並不以帝國主義爲動機，吾人當繼續向我人之和平觀念努力，並減除世界人民之重大軍備負担。然本人於此應有藝面，門裁軍決不能是單方面的，在世界將遍的信任與安全方正建立期間，吾人必須維持吾人之防禦力，並保持強大</p>
<p>對德方　兼籌並顧</p>
<p>繼論德國問題稱，滿意解決德德國間題，爲歐洲繫榮和平與安定之開鍵，吾人不可使中歐成爲賤價，營養不良，及懈怠的勞工之大本營，此等現象司以引起吾人生活水準之降低。故吾人必須審慎行事，但吾人亦決不允德國之工業，再成促成新戰爭之兵工廠，吾人於實施對穗政策時，對於前兩點應予皺籌並顧。吾人已曾考慮各種可能的方案，亦已提出吾人之方案，願意公開予以討論。總之，建立使許多國家可以和平共處，各自享受其傳統文化與思想的歐洲，爲世界和平之必需條件，而解泱德國問題財又爲處置整個問題之最重要開鍵。</p>
<h3>四強外長會議　一週工作檢討　特港問題擬促成直接談判　蘇仍堅持反對多腦河通航</h3>
<p>〔路迅社紐約十日電〕外長會議在紐約開會一星期以來，尚無可以解決前此之困難之象徽。特港·多腦河·及其他棘手問題，僅由四強重申以前之立場，而未有若何變更。義和約之疆界條文，尚未由四強開始討論。若千觀察家認爲四強意在給予義大利及南斯拉夫以相當之時間，以進行直接談判。就羅馬及貝爾格勒最近之發展觀，雙方似已開始在接近之中，止前所欠缺者，爲羅馬。貝爾格勒。與紐約之充份合作，故義國或南國政府就國內政治之老除，隨時司能與四強之鼓勵兩國妥協相衝突。列如蒂托之建議以特港交換戈里齊亞，似與南國外長滌米克在級約所取之方針極少關連。四外長就羅馬尼亞和約之制步討論，並未顯示蘇聯已願改變其前此之立塲，放棄反對西方國家參加多瑙河通航權問題之被列入和約。此外有一黨要之原則已經確立，莫各托夫一週來已一再提出在巴黎和會中被否決之少數國之意見，意即蘇聯至少已準備汝認可能由外長會議就巴黎和會中少數或多數之建議，採取最後決議。</p>

<p>〔聯合社華盛頓九日電〕杜魯鬥總統以普選結果，全國人民對戰時物價管制政策已表示厭惡，乃於今日下令廢止所有不資及物價限制法規，惟房租及糖除外、房租或可相當的提高。總统法令稱：此後市場供求律自由運用，對人民將較善於政府繼縱管制物償。平價法原屬勉強，今旣失去全國人已之贊助，自不能收實效。物價管理局暫予保留，傳主持宜。</p>

<h3>法國民議會競選　西向民治抑東向共產　公已投票下即可分曉</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社巴黎十日電〕法國全國與海外屬地今日選舉第四共和國第一屆國民議會，法國人民兩年來舉行選舉，此爲第九次。國已會議包括議員六百十九席，較第二屆制寒議會多出三二席。席次之分配如下：法國本土五百四十四席，北非呵爾熱里屬地三十席，海外屬地四十五席。義會選總十四日之後，即本月二十四日，全國更將選來共和國咨政院議員，是即國會之第二院，包括議員三百十五席，咨政院將於本年十二月二十四日首次開會，但兩院須至明年一月初始召集正式會議選舉共和國總統，由總統任命內閣總理。第四共和國之政府機構於焉開始活動，臨時政府之任務乃告終止。</p>
<h3>選民二千六百萬　候選人共三千名</h3>
<p>〔路透社巴黎十日電〕法國之二千六百萬男女公民，定於今日選舉解放後之第一屆國會。法本國及海外地區共有候人三千名，競爭國會中之六一八席議員。競選之主要政黨有共產然，社會黨，人民共和黨，急進寫及保守派共和自由黨。三大黨之繼續居於領導地位殆無疑義，惟共黨是否得在國會中取得最多數席，則頗爲一般所關心。半官方面根據內政部估計，謂保守黨，急進黨及共產黨可多獲數席，社會黨無華出入，而人民共和黨則將喪失數席。</p>
<h3>無論何黨獲勝利　終將組聯合政府</h3>
<p>〔聯合社巴黎十日電〕法國選舉人一如戰後歐洲各國，將在東方共產生義與西方已治主義間，有所扶擇，此乃法蘭西第四共和國首屆談會競選之根木義義。人民共和黨謂共黨接受莫斯科之指揮；共黨則謂人民共和黨惟羅馬敎廷之命是聽。（人已共黨亦稱天主敎進步黨。）人已共和黨稱：此乃物質與精神，獨裁與自由之鬥爭，共產黨稱：此乃民主與反動派之門爭。</p>
<p>以前兩屆選舉中，每黨顯示其有五百萬以上黨後；最近一屆制憲議會，議員五七六席，人民共和黨佔一六六席，共產黨佔一五三席，雙方均未能取得多數黨地位。此次議會共六一八席，較制憲議會多出三十一席，故欲或多數黨。非獲得三一〇席不可。在法國多黨制度下，任何黨均無獲得如此多數之機會，無論何黨勝利，務必連絡較小各黨，組織聯合政府。</p>

<h3>中韓境內日資產　蘇仍拒作賠償品　美已將此事意見通知蘇聯</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓九日電〕聯合社今日單獨盲負資方面得悉：美國爲分酗刺鮮境內日本資產事，正與蘇聯進行交涉。國務院聞已通知務聯，聲明願將此項資產留在朝鮮，惟以此項資產留供韓人之用，蘇聯木得染指爲條件。此事最初發動於美國建議，由遠東委負會討論日本賠償事宜蘇聯旋即主張此項會議對日本在國外，尤其是在刺鮮境內所有資產，不在討論範團　之內。美方乃答稱：願將朝鮮境內日本資產留給韓人，但不能讓舉蘇聯。此項爭執尚未決定，須待蘇聯對遠東委會是否有權討論日本貽償問題表明態度後，始能作進一步之折衝。國務院邀請遠東委負會各國召開日本賠償會議一事，　蘇職一國未允參加。蘇聯今要求以不討論日本國外資產爲參加條件，其用意恐不僅欲限制會議涉及朝鮮境內之日本賢產，且欲　蘇聯自中國東九雀滿載而去之日本工業設備亦不提出討論。此外，美國爲欲在　東委會外加速進行日本賠償分配起見，已請該會關係各國與美國磋商，俾草擬臨時訓令，通知麥帥如何進行，將日本國內交產指定爲賠償之用者先向要求賠償各國分配百分之十五至二十。</p>

<h3>透視揚基的工農業　美经济前途預測</h3>
<p>— 本報駐美特派員毛樹清</p>
<p>〔十月九日紐約航訊〕最低倫敦的若干經濟學家預測：美國在最近將來，有一個空前的經濟「不景氣」，不景氣的原因由於經濟失調，龐大的戰時國民收入將趨於銳減，因之，使生產與消費機構完全脫節。英國的繩濟學者還顯料不景氣情形將較一九二一九年尤爲可怕，到那時，華爾街的銀行將全部歡業，工廠停工，商店倒閉？然後再逐漸恢復，像一九三三與一九三四年的情形一樣。</p>
<p>倫數的預測，引起了紐約和華感頓的極度反感。美國的經濟學者們特別是羅斯福「新經濟政策」的那批專家們，提出許多看力的辯護，他們承認美國的經濟復員有困難，但國民消費依然保持原來的水準。一般國民收入、在最近數年內，當不使其突然降低，雖然「這裏面也有許多困歎的因素。」，最富的國家經濟問題最難解決。全世界沒有一個國家的經濟情形此美國今天更畸形，更混亂了。生油沒有了、白糖沒有了，豬肉沒有了；這幾大、連牛奶也不容易買到了。前些日子，卡車司機罷工，火柴也沒有了。如今卡車罷工剛恢復，海員又接著罷工，海員加了薪，碼頭工人又「不幹」了。訐許多多工廠都停許工，工廠主人寗願機器停着生銹，不願賠本而生產。</p>
<p>國會襄成天的辯論，全是爲經濟問題。密歇根州的共和黨眾議員軒佛氏像瘋狂－樣的咆叫：「請政府公開物價管制的眞相！成千累萬的工廠都在逐漸停工歇業，原料買不到，成品又限價，這是美國的末日。」他公開的說：「我們共和然看不慣這些怪事，共和黨誓必打倒DPA（物價管制局）！</p>
<p>共和黨用什麼方法打倒OPA呢？國會的怒吼，咆哮，任　用怎樣本領，物價管制局依然屹立不墮，物價管制局的局長波爾不但是當今華盛頓的「紅人」，而且是杜魯門的經濟智囊之一，前些日子，一度傳說波爾要出任商務部長，「紐約每日新聞」驚奇的寫著：「夫哪！這還了得？」</p>
<p>事賞上，已主黨的現政府是不會改變現行的經濟政策的。商務部這幾夫運續發表著各種統計，證明戰後經濟情況的起色。例如。八月份美全國百貨公司之交易額達一萬萬六千二百五土萬一元，較一九四五年八月份增高百分之二十。全國各廠家六，七，八，三個月的營業額，增高百分之卅六，七。全國零售小商店信息月份的營業額，餃去年入月份增百分之四十四，較今年七月份也增加了百分之十一。商務部的另一報告中，說美國全國的工業製造商入月份出口貨，又增加三萬尤餘元，使總生產額創造一百八十三萬萬元的新紀錄；但在訐多製造商之之，汽車工業，五金工業並無增加，罐頭肉類工業，肥皂工業，製革工業反而喊少。</p>
<p>工業品製造商中開，發展最快，獲利最鉅的，要算香烟工業和紙張工業。皮革工業在美國，幾乎是一絕癥」；戰爭期中，在美國市場上買不到皮箱，皮包，以及婦女用的皮袋。戰後，雖然有許多製革廠恢復開工，但仿然缺乏原料。「動員復員局」的局長期蒂門，前幾天招待華勝頓記者，他說：「動員復員局決定獎　製革廠商，自外國運入先牛皮原料，以加強製革工業，其成品將不受限價之規定。一據皮革業的負責人估計，目前美國日常所用皮革中有百分之三十、原料係自海外得來。至於皮革成品的出口，他搖搖頭說：〔最多百之分一。」</p>
<p>除了皮革以外，美國還缺乏橡皮。戰爭期間，美國的橡皮多半由南美洲（特別從巴西）運來，美國的天時·地利·環境，無法栽種優良的橡樹，正如同無歟栽稱優良的桐油樹一樣。最近，美國向英風訂購甘萬噸橡皮，在今年底以前交貨。此外，還和英國訂立了貿易協定，諸英國商人在罵來亞代爲種植樹林。</p>
<p>過剩生產的是棉花，今年美國南方的棉花又是豐收，棉花的銷路一定過剩。美國政府的國民生產局，計劃逐年減低棉花的生產量，以免影響綿花及棉織工業的價格。第一步計劃先減除百分之十，以後再逐年遞減。</p>
<p>棉花問題還不是經濟病態的核心，目前美國經濟失調的關鍵，仍在於工業生產的脫節，以及工資與成本的如何調整。據聯邦準備銀行景近的商情報告，全國許干城市的商號公司，九月份都獲鉅利；但向來依靠工廠爲主的商號，則大受打擊。匹茨堡，美國最大的重工業中心，九月份全城的商舖營業，減少百分之七十一，原因是動力工人罷工，許多小商店，都因而遭致倒閉。</p>
<p>農業的情形最穩定，也最樂觀。美國的農業經濟學者，一向主張減少農村人口，以增加濃戶個別的耕地。戰爭四年的結果，美國譏民因戰爭而勝離農村的，有四百萬人；但濃業生產並不因農村人口喊少而減少。相反的，豐業生產的總值，較戰前增加了四分之一。美國全國農業工業化，大量機械和新式農的使用，是原因之一，其次是水利灌溉的良好設施，轉農村確立了不拔的基業</p>
<p>爲了平衡一九四七年度的聯幫政府預算，杜魯門總統減除了三分之二的明年度〔水利經費」，總值約計美金五萬萬元。颺會中一羣來自田園的議員，因而大爲憤慨。他們組織了一個小組會，要請社魯門親自解釋，這羣人中，爲苜的兩名，是來自TVA故鄕柏田納西州參議員夢凱拉和司蒂互二氏，此外，尚有密西西比州眾議員魏丁敦，阿根斯州的眾議員哈烈斯，阿爾巴馬州眾議員鮑可在水利身上打簡約的主意？何況，一減就減云了百分之六十五？」瑪來蘭州的眾議員倍耳，描寫社魯門政府此種飾約，是「市會」式的算　。何爾巴馬州的眾議員鮑肯。設得很激烈，他說：國會通過的水利經費，總統根本無羅刪削。他說：「我們平衡預算的方法很多，少送一點物資到南斯拉夫去，不就得了嗎？」</p>
<p>吐魯門總統親自出席了他們的會議，總統很敬佩他們爲農民謀幸福的真誠。總統很歉和地說：「我一定接受諸君的意見，讓我再從長老慮一下。」</p>
<p>道件公案算是這樣告了一個段落。一個旁聽的中國記者，不能不特別感動，我們是「以農立國」的國家啊，我們該怎樣做呢？</p>

<h3>哈同遺產再起訟爭　十二族人近又準備在法院起訴　要求按依拉克法律處理　平分全部遣產四分之三</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕紛爭十五年之哈同遺產案，勝利後又死灰復燃。哈同近親伊拉克人十二人，經數月之準備，近擬再興大訟，即將其狀本市地方法院，要求分析遺產。記者昨訪代理律師宋允惠，據談如下：</p>
<p>此案徵結爲歐司愛哈同的國籍問題，哈同賓未入英國國籍，而爲一僑居我國之伊拉克籍猶太人，西歷一八五三年生於伊拉克之倍克特（Bagdad）城，其時伊拉克尚爲法國之保護國，一九三一年六月歐司愛哈同逝世後，曾得法當局證明並朱發給歐司愛哈同「喪失國籍證書」。同時英最高法院亦僅稱哈同爲得英國保護之伊拉克人民。駐本市之英領事亦曾證明，哈同歸化英國，並無紀錄，如此哈同之國籍確爲伊拉克已極明顯。</p>
<p>哈同之遺產既在中國，根據國際法，應照中國法律處理，而中國法律中之法律適用條例第四章，第二十條載明：「繼承依被繼承人之本國法」，第二十一條：「遺囑之成立要件及效力依成立時遺囑人之本國法」，第十四條：「養子女成立之要件依當事人去該本國法，養子女之效力依養父母之本國法」。故哈同遺產應照伊拉克法律處理。</p>
<p>根據伊拉克遺產法：死者如無直系卑親族，其配偶應得遺產總值四分之一，四分之三應平分予近親族。</p>
<p>哈同家族世系</p>
<p>朱律師復敘述歐司愛哈同之家族世系稱：哈同之祖父名阿伯拉罕（Lo　Rhim）生三子，長子Aaror亞洛即爲歐司愛哈同之生父。二子阿伯拉培（Abrabi）生二子，長子Mir僅傳一子名西雄Sion，爲歐司愛哈同之姪孫，於一九三二年經巴格達法院判決，認爲歐司愛哈同十二名合法繼承人之一。其餘十一人爲西雄之堂姪愛柴拉Ezra，猶可勃（Yaronb），納宏（Naham），沙耳Sanl，宏克（Homgui）柴拉，阿柏拉罕（Saleh　Abrahin），柴拉，猶孔勃（Saleh　Yaconb），馬奇（Moechi），及歐司愛哈同三叔父之孫，Ｅzna愛柴拉，Nahom奈紅，Ibrahim阿伯拉罕三人。</p>
<p>歐司愛哈同死後五年，此十二人之一人．曾具狀英法院控告哈同夫人羅迦陸，要求依照伊拉克法律分析遺產，然當時英國政府貪圖此鉅額遣產稅，與爭取前工部局納稅投票權，故強認哈同爲英保護之人民，應至英法律節制，因此羅迦陵勝訴。一九四一年十一月又一人再向駐本市之英國按察署起訴，旋因太平洋戰事發生，此案乃告擱置，未經審理。</p>
<p>否認螟蛉子女</p>
<p>民國三十年十月羅迦陵之死，與我國抗戰勝利廢除領事裁判權，使哈同遣產糾紛轉入另一環境，故十二名伊拉克人，最近又委託宋律師準備進行訴訟，並向當局請求兩點：（一）當局如認爲有必要另組管理處，管理哈同產業，則必須邀十二人中之一參加。（二）自稱哈伺螟蛉子女者，不得參加管理哈同遣產。並致函地政局對遺產請停止過戶。</p>
<p>哈同遺產據民國二十年佔計約值四百萬金鎊，（羅迦陵承認之數月）戰後谷國通貨貶值，且地產價格高漲，故目前其遺產價值已然法精確估計，然終必爲一天文學數字。現在此十二人所考慮者即爲遣產數額過鉅，若以此爲訴訟標的，則訟費亦將爲一驚人數字，無力負担。經多方考慮，現業已決定訴訟個別進行，以減少訟費，且如敗訴，其餘十一人可再接再厲作長期奮鬥。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕市參議會潘議長，市黨部方主委，僑務委員會常務委員蕭吉珊，昨日正午假座紹興路七十四號章宅，宴請暹羅元老　比里等一行。暹國訪問團出席者，除　比里氏本人外，尚有比里夫人，鑾索紳，越差拉猜猜實鐵劃，乃維特西瓦耶暖，鄭光盛，乃蘇谷良，乃索姆吉等七人。地方長官及各界人士。列席作陪者數十人，並有女賓多位，濟濟一堂，談笑風生，至二時許始散。　民對北平之印象至佳，對故都之古蹟名勝’尤多留戀，調以時間過短，不能觀光天津，實爲憾事。</p>
<p>中暹邦交增進</p>
<p>〔又訊〕暹羅元老　比里氏接見本報記者時稱：渠在京時數度與蔣主席討論增進中暹兩國邦交諸問題，深信兩國間具有歷史性之友誼，今後必日益增強。過去暹境之排華事件，親日政權應負其責，現政府對於華僑之利益，已採有效之保護辦法，安全可無問題。至於增進中暹兩國之文化交流問題，本人在京時亦曾與貴國當局交換意見。</p>
<p>外交界消息：中暹邦交近有顯著之進步。原因爲：（一）政治上暹羅將來請求加入聯合國，以及與其他列強交涉時，希望我國能予以支持。（二）經濟上，暹羅亟盼發展出口業，其每年生產之米，百分之七十輸出國外，我國以地理之接近，爲最理想之市場。此外經濟上相互需要之處亦多。（三）暹國報紙對於中國之報道慚趨於正確，誤會逐漸減少。</p>

<h3>國旗覆蓋靈柩　端納昨行葬禮　主席夫婦致贈菊花十字架</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕四十年來盡瘁中國的蔣主席私人顧問威廉亨利端納，於昨日下午三時，在蔣夫人及生前友好的默禱中，安然入土，下葬虹橋萬國公墓。</p>
<p>端納治喪事宜，全部由勵志社辦理。端民在前晨一時十五分壽終宏恩後，即車迭膠州路萬國殯儀館，由該館爲之化裝。昨日上午九時起，各界紛粉前往憑弔。遺體安靜的躺在柚木靈柩中，上面蓋着青天白日滿地紅國旗，僅露出頭部及上半身。穿藏靑西裝，藍灰襯衫，打深藍灰條領帶，插袋內插白色手帕一條。神貌端莊，但因臉部化裝過於灰白，而室內燈光又如此黯淡，真使熟識端氏的人們，感覺到在黃色燈光底下睡眠的是一個老人的蠟像！</p>
<p>靈柩安置於禮堂中央，柩後正中插立蔣主席夫婦致贈黃白菊花編成的十字架一座，上繫白色緞帶，一邊書英文，一邊則寫「端納先生千古，蔣中正蔣宋美齡敬輓」。十字架兩勞，右立中國國旗，左立澳大利亞旗。柩後兩勞及壁上，均懸有黃白色菊花花圈，地上並置有黃白盆菊十餘盆。葉恭綽的一首輓詩尤增奠弔者的哀悼，詩云「君來余已病，君去我猶存，浩刦人難挽，文壇爾自尊。斷金言比重，贈策史留痕，嘆息哀遲甚，憑何慰九泉？」</p>
<p>下午一時後，參加端氏入殮儀式的人士都陸續到達，由勵志社職員和端氏友好引導入窒瞻仰遺容。蔣夫人由孔令侃扶着，偕孔令偉女士在一時五十分到殯儀館。夫人面呈憂鬱之色，御黑色呢大衣，黑綢長旗袍，然鷄皮高跟鞋，黑手套，手提黑皮包。入門後默然不作一語，靜坐端氏遺體對面第一排位置中座。旋吳市長夫婦及孔祥熙亦相繼而來。</p>
<p>入殮儀式</p>
<p>二時正，入殮儀式開始，預備扶柩的端氏好友田伯烈·陳納德·黃仁霖·鄭祖穆醫師·郤伯門·史貝雷等六人，分立靈柩兩勞。英收師屈維脫則站在外室眾來賓前，誦讀禱文，並由全體起立，低首爲死者祈禱。約歷二十分鐘後禮畢，由黃總幹事報告，請各來賓在端氏靈前作最後之瞻仰後散去。端納的遣容就在緊密的棺蓋下悄然隱藏。棺蓋上仍覆着國旗和蔣主席夫婦致送的禮物——菊花十字架。</p>
<p>舉行安葬</p>
<p>蔣夫人等站立在門外等候，田伯烈等六人分扶靈柩上車。殯葬的行列中，由屈收師車前導，柩車緊隨，後爲扶柩者車，繼則爲蔣夫人等一行十餘輛，駛往虹橋萬國公墓。安葬的穴地，事先已妥爲佈置，墓穴四周，舖有碧草。靈柩安放皮帶上後，潮漸安放。時屈收師耶續安葬禱文，蔣夫人等亦均默立柩前。至二時四十五分葬禮畢，端納靈柩降入墓穴，黃總幹事代表向來賓致謝。蔣夫人俟各人將二十餘只花圈　獻於墓　後，即返官邸。</p>
<p>昨日端氏大殮及葬禮，因　　　力求　單。但深切的哀悼情緒並不因之稍減。往悼者倘有顧惠慶·王正廷·張道藩·貝　　·錢大鈞·宣鐵吾及其他端氏中外友好百餘人。昨日警察周特派該局最精練的特種警察數十名衛護，由督察嚴祥鵠牽領照料一切。又中委張道藩昨特撰文以輓端氏末署「一個敬愛　的中國朋友張道藩敬輓。」</p>
<h3>蔣夫人暫緩返京</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕蔣失人此次由京來滬，據　端納病狀，迨端氏病逝後，並主持　禮。原定昨日下午端氏安葬完畢后返京，茲因馬歇爾元帥夫人之女公子惠恩夫人，將於十二日上午來滬，故暫留滬一二日，俟惠恩夫人抵達後，即偕馬夫人等同返京。</p>
<h3>宋院長昨晨返京</h3>
<p>行政院院長朱子文氏，已於昨晨十時乘專機由龍華機場起飛返京，參事秘書一行數人隨行。</p>

<h3>滬閔公路上　參觀普慈療養院　住的是各種不同的精神病者　有哭有笑有在詈罵有在詛咒</h3>
<p>〔本報特寫〕客車顛簸在滬閔公路上向普慈療義院前進，同車夫參觀的記者們都省些抱怨路太遠路面太崎嶇，一直到車子駛進那紅色的立體式建築的大門，在莊嚴的聖母石像下停住，再看到了各式各樣的精神病人以後，這一種抱怨的倩緒才被濃厚的興趣所替代了</p>
<p>隔着鐵棚招呼</p>
<p>人不幸而患病，尤其不幸的是患了精神病，他們整天整晚浸潤在變態的痛苦的思想中，並由此而產生種種異常的可笑甚至可怕的行動。在我們所看到的許多病人之中最有趣的是一位自稱滬江大學一九三六級文學士的男病人，據說他是因爲坐人力車被汽車撞跌下來，腦部受震傷，從此就患了羊癲瘋的絕症；每當週期性發作時，會完全失去知覺，但是在神智清楚的時候，卻老是鬧着要出院。昨天當我們經過他病房的時侯，他正坐在走廊裏看生活雜誌，額角上有幾處紅藥水塗抹的傷痕。他看見我們就跳了起來，隔着鐵欄柵也不知向那一位招呼，用英語夾着上海話說：「喂，你不認識我了嗎？一九三六，MA，×××是我同學，還有×××，你不曉得嗎？我要出院去，王曉籟開的畏興煤礦　我去帮忙，但是醫生不讓我走，他　我哥哥來領，請你去告訴我哥哥好馬？」突然，他從口袋裏拿出一顆木質的圖章，憤憤地對醫師說：「我自己可以蓋章，爲什麼一定要哥哥來？」醫師安慰他：「因爲你哥哥是你的保護人。」他聽了把圖章放回口袋，嘴角浮起無可奈何的苦笑，「德國式的教育。　全是德國式的教育！」他喃喃地</p>
<p>像京劇裏媒婆</p>
<p>大病房里的景像更是無奇不有，首先看到的是一個老太婆，頭上紮了三根小辮，一根在頭頂，兩根在鬢邊，整個的形狀非常像舞台上京劇里的媒婆。她站在凳上，手舞足蹈的高唱有腔有調的小曲，而勞邊則有一個中年病婦大聲吵罵，這一個婦人相當美麗，身體也很結實，兩頓更透出自然的紅暈，假如不是在這精神病院裏，誰都會相信她是非常健康的。但是現在她卻不斷地說着不連貫的下流的俚語。她向看護抗議不要讓老太婆唱小調，她說：「她倒可以唱，我是六〇六……火燒光了，救火會車子走了……我們是漢奸，你來捉吧……。」</p>
<p>這批洋裝癟三</p>
<p>對面病房裏又傳來嗚嗚的哭聲，遠遠望去，有幾個十歲左右的女孩子伏在窗檻上，在我們走過去的時候，其中一個唱起山歌來：「你們真奇怪呀！」而當我們在離開病房的時候，又聽到那中年婦人帶着歇斯底里的笑聲在篤：「你們這批洋裝癟三！」</p>
<p>病情較輕的很多在園地夷散步，其中不少外國人，他們都顯很很安靜，</p>
<p>由彬彬有禮。有些將痊愈的則與平常人差不了多少。他門中許多並且是「藝術家」，有一間工作室牆上盡是畫的山水和人物。昨天中委孔祥熙和中宣部彭部長的代表唐熙治也在參觀，有一位病人指着孔氏笑對記者說：「他是不是孔祥熙？院裏經費有辦法了。」</p>
<p>院長報告情形</p>
<p>因爲時間關係，來不及再細細參觀，院方就開始茶會談話。院長陸英耕首先報告了該院的一般情形。普慈療養院是民國二十四年六月由已故慈善家陸伯鴻先生與天主教會合作創辦，在北橋鎮南購地百畝，建築新式療養院十四座。每一院舍均繞以花園草地，空氣光綫極佳，一切設備亦均齊全。全院共有病牀五百張，現有病人三百二十六人，取費爲頭等每日三萬元，二等二萬元，三等一萬元。治療方面除注射藥物以外，並注重分析病人心理，以求導入正軌。</p>
<p>普慈療養院從成立起至現在共收病人二，四一一人，七中死亡者二四六人，出院者一．八三九人，完全痊愈者一五八一人。</p>
<p>暮色蒼茫中又踏上汽車，聖母像上的電炬從視綫中漸漸消失，我們又回到燈紅酒綠的「正常」世界裏來了。</p>
<h3>上海美術協會　張道藩送師行　歡迎齊溥兩大畫家　谷春帆賦詩佐興　兩女作家叩頭拜師</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕上海美術協會昨日下午三時，假乍浦路文化會堂歡迎名畫師齊白石及名畫家溥心畲兩氏。到市參議會潘議長，市黨部方主委，美術界各流及各界人士千餘人，最後並有暹羅元老　比里等亦蒞會參加。由最近來滬養疴之齊白石新收弟子張道藩氏主席，致歡迎詞稱：今天我們歡迎齊溥二先生，他們一位是年高八十六，藝術造詣，蜚聲中外的藝術泰斗，另一位也是譽滿中華的大畫家。這個歡迎會原定十二日舉行，因爲那一天不僅爲國父的誕展，更是中國歷史上空前的好日子，制憲的國民大會開慕的日子。但是因爲齊老先生急於回北平，溥先生是國大代表，今晚要晉京，所以提早今天舉行。</p>
<p>希望充實藝術寶藏</p>
<p>關於兩先生的爲人學識和一切，用不着多來介紹。我們最佩服的，是齊先生研究藝衛，從事藝術的精神，真是數十年如一日，所以能成爲藝術界的泰斗。至於齊老先生的高風亮節的偉大人格，更是值得我們敬仰。另一位溥先生，是前清的貴族，但他在民國未成立前，就看不起貴族生活，專心研究文學藝術。九一八以後，屢次遭到敵人的威逼利誘，都不屈服。可見他對偉大的中華民族有清楚的認識，不做危害民族的工作。七七以後，溥先生一直住在萬壽山上閉門不出，因之他的詩文字畫達到最高峯。我們希望齊老先生今後仍多畫些畫，充實藝術寶藏。我們希望溥先生以後也多幫助我們，指導我們。這時全體參加的人起立鼓掌，向齊溥兩先生致歡迎之意。並由張道藩愛女張麗蓮及王微微二小姐獻花。</p>
<p>行雲流水出乎自然</p>
<p>繼由張半匋氏代表齊白石氏致謝詞，並介紹齊溥兩先生淪陷時期在故都之生活、稱齊先生八年未出大門一步，住宅四周，圍以鐵刺，如同監牢，而溥先生八年沒下萬壽山。傳心畬氏亦致詞稱，各種讚譽的話不敢當，守正不阿，威武不屈是做人的基本原則。</p>
<p>最後由來賓代表方主委及潘議長致詞。方氏就人生藝術化，社會藝術化及完成人生之真善美諸點有所發揮。潘議長稱譽齊氏之作品如行雲流水，出乎自然。對於溥氏的忠貞自守，藝術造詣也致敬意。並對孔子所說「止於道，游於藝」二語，有所闡述。</p>
<p>演說畢，由郎毓秀女表演歌曲，並放映五彩影片「不屈服的中國」助興。當日活動情形，由國泰影片公司拍攝新聞片。</p>
<p>〔又訊〕昨晚六時，張道藩假塘沽路魯關路「文藝小憩」設宴歡送齊溥兩氏。到各界賢達百餘人。席間並有郎靜山夫人雷佩芝女士及女作家趙清閣女士，磕頭拜齊白石氏爲老師，尚有其他餘興多種。財政局長谷春帆並賦詩兩首，贈二位當代各畫家，附錄如下：「近代畫宗白石翁，閉門風趣幾人同，十年閒卻凌煙手，只畫胡蘆與草蟲，」又一首爲「溥老丹青舊所知，十年亂後復歸時，胸中邱壑今猶在，不作王孫作畫師。」至十時餘賓主畫歡而散。</p>

<p>個敵產房屋住戶之意見，約可歸納爲下列三點：（一）當局爲充裕國庫，而使百姓流離失所，必引起人民反感。（二）標賣房屋，而驅逐享有租賃權之現住人，法理人情均有未合。（三）各機關使用之敵產房屋，因無處可搬而取消標賣。政府機關尚無處可遷，小百姓又向何處覓屋。故再向當局呼籲，標賣敵產房屋，應仍保留原住戶之租賃權。</p>

<h3>海上梨園的盛衰</h3>
<p>本報特稿</p>
<p>梅蘭芳楊寶森已經在中國大戲院登台了，程硯秋譚富英就要在天　演出，兩次陣容之整齊，爲近年來所罕見。此次中國和天　，對　轟動一時，海上的「周郎」們大有應接不暇之勢。</p>
<p>近來平劇已漸見式微，美國影片，充斥市塲，的篤班和申曲等低級的通俗地方劇，奪去了很多的觀衆，平劇只能以機關佈景爲號召，即使北伶南來，也祇有「劈」「紡」可以呌座。從這次譚富英在皇后演出，賣座之慘看來，深爲平劇之前途担憂。</p>
<p>平劇何以會造成這種現象呢？第一是角兒包銀太大，不得不把座價提高，在這物價飛漲，生計艱難的年頭，會化兩萬，一萬八千來聽一回戲的，有幾們人呢？第二是戲劇的水準，不合聽衆的胃口。經過了八年的戰爭，社會情形是大大改變了。過去文縐縐坐在戲　子裏的聽衆，現在大都已無餘資再來作座上客。代之而起者乃過去的中下階級，他們有的是金錢，可是同樣化錢，他們却羣趨於色情狂和低級趣味的娛樂。興盛百餘年的平劇，已爲他們所摒棄。過去　曲受皮　的打擊，是因崑曲本身太「古典化」了，如今平劇走向下坡，又爲了觀衆水準低落的緣故。</p>
<p>這次兩處浩大陣容的演出，確爲海上劇壇的盛舉，但向前瞻望，這是中興氣象呢？這是廻光反照？這憶昔時盛况，不免有點感概系之。</p>
<p>茶園·舞台·戲院　劇塲的演進</p>
<p>上海的劇塲，最初皆以茶園爲名，如迎春，丹桂，春桂等皆是。後來競仿西式建築，改稱舞台，現今大多數的平劇院，仍用舞台的名稱。至於所謂戲院者，其初僅爲映電影之塲所，漸有改演平劇者，仍沿用昔日之名稱，新設的劇塲，亦有採用戲院之名者。從茶園而舞台，而戲院，爲上海劇塲演進的三個階段。</p>
<p>戲館何以稱爲茶園呢？的確那時戲館的內部，有些和茶樓相彷彿，裏面放着許多方桌，客至必進茶一碗，又有瓜子水果點心等碟子，放在前面。但來客之意，不爲品茗。或謂故都大半皆「知音」之人。他們進戲園子，且聽且飲，正與在茶樓中品茗相似。</p>
<p>一說謂在遜淸乾隆時，故都戲館林立，皇室貴胄，八旗子弟，徵歌選舞，毫無顧忌，高宗乃下令停閉戲院，弦歌之聲遂　。後值皇太后萬壽，伶人進宮演唱。從此禁令漸弛，重振旗歌，然不敢　違功令，故改稱爲茶園。上海亦用此稱，不名戲館。</p>
<p>茶園式的戲館</p>
<p>現在廣東路山東路之西，俗呼「滿庭芳」。這「滿庭芳」三字，即最早的一家平劇院之名。滿庭芳開設於同治五年，在寶善街寗綏街之間完全模仿京式。滿庭芳開幕後，營業大盛，有劉維忠者見之，接踵而起，在寶善街建立丹桂戲園，其後又在小東門分設南丹桂。此外尙有天仙，迎春，春桂等，都是茶園式的戲館。</p>
<p>茶園式的戲館，樓下正中，排列許多方桌，每桌設坐椅六位，此爲正廳。正廳之後及兩旁爲邊廂。樓上亦隔成包廂，每廂坐十數人。臺上下都用煤氣燈，不甚光明，後復加紗單，及電燈出，煤氣燈乃漸漸淘汰。</p>
<p>新式舞台建築，始於城內九畝地之新舞台。光緒末年，夏月珊夏月潤等計劃建造新式戲院，時兩江總督及上海道亦頗注意華界市塲，乃有振市公司之組織，後復勘定臺直於九畝地。新舞台之內部構造旣寬大，又新穎，佈置井然，與茶園式之戲館大異，惜開鑼不及一旬，慈禧光緒相繼　天，以國喪故，停演二十七天，大受打擊。後由開明接辦，夏氏昆仲主演濟公傳，其初營業頗盛，旋亦不　。民國十八年後，該地改建市房，從此無新舞台之遺跡矣。</p>
<p>舞台的歷史</p>
<p>新舞台建造後，丹桂茶園繼而翻造，他處亦紛紛改建新式戲院，茶園遂無人問津。今各戲院中，以大舞台之　築爲最新，民國廿四年落成。天蟾舞台最大，可容觀衆四千餘人，初名上海舞台，自顧竹軒接辦後始改此稱。過云的天蟾舞台，乃在永安公司七重天的地方，正門開在九江路。至現在梅蘭芳演出的中國大戲院，最初稱爲三星舞台，後因發生糾紛，乃改由從前在閘北開設的更新舞台接辦，易名更新舞台。其稱爲中國大戲院，還是近年的事。</p>
<p>至於稱爲戲院的劇塲，最初映電影，其後演平劇，也有連名稱並不更改的。像黃金大戲院，前爲一第三流的電影院，自改演平劇後，仍用此名。當時其他各處，均以佈景新戲爲號召，而黃金獨演舊劇，頗爲海上一般「戲迷」所讚許。卡爾　亦爲電影院，以前不過偶一表演歌舞，但其建築，頗近舞台，後周信芳在該院演平劇頗久。</p>
<p>蘭心是一家最好的歌劇塲</p>
<p>這純粹西洋風味，僅偶爾出演平劇彩牌的　心，也值得提一下。因爲他是上海最完善的現代式劇塲。現在這爾西愛路蒲石路轉角的，已是第三個塲址了。一八六七年，西人所設愛美劇社在博物園路建造新式劇塲，乃一木質房屋，不幸燬於火。一八七二年，改建磚屋，迄一九二九年止，演出的戲不少。這所已歷五十餘年的建築物，在一九二九年，由蘭心原主，以十七萬五千兩的代價賣去，改在前法租界另建新　，此即現在的蘭心。新蘭心於一九三一年二月五日開幕。他雖祇有七百多個座位，但視綫音波，都經過一番研究，同時座位寬暢舒適，穿堂富麗堂皇，全院淸爽幽靜，實爲海上所僅有。可惜以電影爲主，但有時也爲話劇團體所借彡，實在是一所最好的歌劇劇塲。</p>
<p>上海的科班</p>
<p>科班是伶人的發源地，坐科是伶人的正途出身。像北平的富運成，有相當歷史的科班，譚富英馬連良等，都在富連成坐過科。後來也有稱爲學校的，如北平的中華戲曲學校，上海的上海戲劇學校皆是。</p>
<p>五十年前，上海已成立了一個科班，呌做「天華錦小京班」。創辦的是天津人顧崇德，他本以販馬爲業，因訴訟失敗，在津不能立足，乃來滬謀出路其時上海平劇頗盛，乃在胡家宅一帶覓得市房，加以修葺，改爲戲院，招致了一班小孩子，訓續起來。學生藝名，均冠以「賽」字，如「賽長庚」，「賽業　」，「賽呂布」，「賽貂蟬」之類，以狠勇跌撲見長。後來出演，初售三角，時汪桂芬在天福演出，亦售三角，故營業不振，旋又跌至一角，仍無人問津。同時顧榮總常虐待童伶。心中多不平。某中一人，寬以剿刀割傷顧下部，因此畢命。顧子深知其父之罪，絕不追究，反將意伶字據，一一焚燬，從此，這科班亦就星散了。</p>
<p>民國廿八年，上海戲劇學校成立，是一個很好的科班，沒有幾年工夫，造就的人才，已薄負時譽，終以不勝負担，無形解散。</p>
<p>上海戲劇學校是由票友俞　谷，老伶工劉松機所發起的，設於福煦路老大華舞　　壁。陳承蔭任校長，俞　谷自任總務主任，關鴻賓任敎務主任，招得　伶一百餘人，開始訓練。初辦時經濟非常據拮，致敎職員大都爲半義務性質，因學生中有不少內行伶人的子弟，在家裏已經會唱，所以苦了半年，已覺得很有希望。校方乃以三萬元去置辦行頭，於廿九年十月十二日在黃金大戲院初次登台，頗使各界驚異。此後每逢星期三六，日塲在黃金演出，即以收入補充開支。</p>
<p>戲校解散後，這班初出道的意伶，開始在各地奔走，正式度他們的舞台生活。其中如關正明，王正堃，顧正秋，張正芳等，藝事已大有可觀。惟顧正秋爲譚富英跨刀，在皇后出演，賣座甚慘，受此打擊，對其前途，也未始不予以一種鼓勵。</p>
<p>梅蘭芳：霸王別姬</p>
<p>譚鑫培：定軍山</p>
<h3>髦兒戲　巾帽鬚眉俄頃換　迷離撲朔渾難辨</h3>
<p>小隊登塲恣婉變，嫋嫋婷婷，早入勾攔選。一曲凌波羅機淺，臨風欲把仙裾挽。忽引嬌吭歌調變，側帽宮花，斜壓蟬雲顫，巾帽鬚眉俄傾換，雌雄撲朔渾難辦。</p>
<p>這一　宋人詠女梨園的詞，正可爲髦兒戲寫照。宋代是否有女伶，姑不詳考。但在六七十年前，梨園弟子是沒有女性的，所謂髦兒戲，同光年間始於上海，遂成一時風尙。迨後女界開通，女伶也漸多，到現在大有沒有坤角，不能成班之勢。</p>
<p>據說在同光年間，北方有一個名丑呌李毛兒的，擅長頑笑戲，和花旦謝寶琳搭配，演來無一不令人捧腹。李毛兒除頑笑戲之外，就是方巾丑，也演來韻味十足。後來在滬演出，頗博得好評。李毛兒雖是名丑，但他的包銀，祇有三十餘元，生活頗感拮据。後來給他想出一條活路來，招集左右鄰居的幾個貧家女子，年齡在十一二歲至十六七歲之間敎之以戲，不論生旦凈丑，都由他一人任敎。經過一年訓練之後，居然成一女性童伶班。就把他自己的名字「毛兒」兩字稱爲班名，在各地演出，頗受人歡迎，後來毛兒戲改爲髦兒戲，實是筆談，毛兒戲在當年，專門供應一般名紳巨商人家的喜慶堂會，每台演戲四齣，酬資十六元，另有加官賞封。點戲一齣，再加四元。所演的戲，都是三數人合事的文戲，如三娘敎子，遊龍戲鳳，鳥龍院，二進宮等是。戲衣行頭，臨時租借，戲台亦臨時搭架。後來營業日盛，應接不暇，乃購買雛伶，增排各戲，於是規模漸具。堂會價目，亦由十六元增至二十八元。</p>
<p>最後又有女性戲院的創設，居然生涯鼎盛。但國曲者多是「醉翁」之意。目前上海的小廣　·長樂·時代等小型戲塲，演出以女性伶人爲主，頗有髦兒戲之風味。但一般大戲院中。也有坤角，坤角之挑大　者，並不較乾角爲弱，大有對峙之勢，這是李毛兒當時所意料有及的。</p>
<h3>名伶紅伶時伶　老伶工憑能耐吃飯　新藝人靠捧塲賺錢</h3>
<p>伶人有名伶·紅伶·時伶之分，其間雖無極明顯之「鴻溝」，但大致可以看出他們的界綫。</p>
<p>在一百多個科班裏坐科的學生中，卒業時，能列入名伶者，僅數人而已。可見名伶是很難得的。要有好的歌喉，好的扮相，還得經過千錘百練，出神入化，才有獻藝　　之資格。在「中國」演出的梅蘭芳，盛名歷三十餘年而不衰，今雖年逾「知命」，在舞台上，仍扮作嫋嫋婷婷的女兒之身，已非易事，足爲當代保伶之領袖，尊爲「博士」而無愧。</p>
<p>上海自通商以後，人口漸多，市况日繁，戲院營業亦大盛，北方名伶，均以上海爲銷金之窟，紛紛南來獻技。早年如譚鑫培，孫菊仙，汪桂芬，余叔岩，楊月樓，王瑤卿，王長林，龔雲甫，程繼仙等，均曾先後來滬演出，近則與梅一同演出的楊寶森，蕭長華，姜妙香，以及即將在天蟾登台之程硯秋，譚富英等，不論其爲主角配角，均有特長，皆可加入名伶之列。</p>
<p>皮　雖以故者爲策源地，但名伶不一定出在北方。周信芳唱白，不脫南音，但其扮相表情，亦有可取。李春來，蓋呌天之武功，楊小樓亦極稱道。老三麻子，王鴻壽的關公，南北共推。崑曲家俞振飛，以票友而下海，亦今日小生中之不可多得者，儒雅瀟灑，似在姜妙香之上。此均爲南方之名伶。</p>
<p>名伶雖有甜潤之歌喉，俊美之扮相，與造詣高深之藝技，但亦有終身未成名者。南方碩果僅存的老供奉瑞德寶，老伶工張榮奎，均流落不遇，敎戲糊口。貴俊卿，高慶奎亦曾來滬演唱，終於鬱鬱而終。時歟！時歟！</p>
<p>紅伶</p>
<p>紅伶是指在藝壇上能享大名的人。名伶不一定會「紅」，紅伶也並不全是技藝超羣。有人說：「老伶工憑能耐吃飯，新藝人靠捧塲賺錢。」正是名伶與紅伶的註解。民國廿八年，王玉蓉在黃金演唱的時候，把乃師王瑤卿捧了出來，廣告上還用「王瑤卿老供奉親自把塲」的話來號召，這不是借師之名來增自己的身價麼？</p>
<p>紅伶雖沒有超羣的技藝，却也必有其長，能用其長，故得另創一種新作風，新格調。馬連良列爲四大鬚生之一，觀其演出，俏皮的做工，邊式的扮相，改良的行頭，純在利用所長，旣省力，又呌座，一舉兩得。這種紅伶，在「本鈿」和「能耐」方面，固不如名伶，但吸引觀衆的魔力，也許會較名伶更大。</p>
<p>不是名伶的紅伶，在舞台上的命運，往往不能持久。如毛世來，裘盛戎，高盛麟等，以前也曾紅過一番，雖其藝事資望尙淺，若加努力，亦不難儕於名伶之列。可惜不知自愛，「紅」色漸漸變而爲「黑」了。高盛麟現在黃金，改唱鬚生，頗足號召，仍望好自爲之。</p>
<p>伶人「走紅」完全是機會。像以凈角而挑大樑的金少山，前在上海老共舞台時，祇不過是個唱開鑼戲的起碼角兒，因替梅蘭芳配別姬中的霸王，一演而紅。舊例霸王是由武生扮的，其時梅劇團的武生是孫毓堃，應該由他來扮。那天台上金少山正唱刺王僚，派戲的問梅老　：「明天別姬，誰唱霸王？」梅老　聽到台上正唱着那黃鐘大呂之音，便問：「台上唱的是誰？」派戲的回答說：「是金秀山的兒子金少山。」梅蘭芳靈機一動，便呌金少山配霸王。前塲梅蘭芳仍和孫毓堃配一齣長板坡來安慰他，眞是想得週到。</p>
<p>時伶</p>
<p>至於所謂時伶，完全是以投機取巧來迎合觀衆的。童芷苓在「皇后」演出時，比譚富英更呌座，這是她拿手的「劈」「紡」的魔力。共舞台在報上大事宣傳，居然連夜客滿。這種以色情爲號召的，是時伶最普遍的作風。再像已入獄的李萬春。現在天蟾演出的李少春，允文允武，有唱不做，顯得他是多才多藝，其實也是時伶。回憶李萬春初次隨梅蘭芳南來的時候，還是個十五六歲的小孩子，已是紅得發紫。和藍月春演一齣兩將軍，比楊小樓的連環套還呌座。論其演技，確可以呌一聲好，尤其是出演的一個多月，很少演第二次的戲，所以火候雖不如，已可列入名伶了。但不久串演文戲，由名伶，紅伶，而變爲時伶，勝利以後，鎯鐺入獄。生平不僅會扮演舞台上的人物，同時又會串演各種不同的伶人，亦是一長。</p>
<p>梅蘭芳：刺虎</p>
<h3>海上聖手　琴師陳阿金　鼓手趙嵩綬</h3>
<p>平劇中，伴奏的樂器，以胡琴與鼓爲最重要，琴師鼓手在梨園界亦往往克享大名，若梅雨田孫佐臣之琴，李五劉順之鼓，皆不同凡響。海上塲面中，昔日亦有兩人，琴師陳阿金與鼓手趙嵩綬，可稱一時之傑。</p>
<p>某年汪桂芬來滬，其琴師因病不能操琴，班主　阿金以代之。但桂自以爲彼之唱腔，非他人所能托襯得宜者，故對於阿金，先存鄙視之心。迨登塲後，唱至中途，琴弦忽斷，桂芬不覺着忙，以目頻視阿金，頗露不快之意。塲上諸人及後台管事，莫不爲阿金捏一把汗，阿金却異常鎭定，若無其事，竟操單弦，以終此曲。事畢，阿金向桂芬道歉，汪亟笑迎曰：「今日始知汝琴藝之高，眞名不虛傳也。」</p>
<p>鼓手趙嵩綬，爲名旦趙君玉之祖父，通透「六塲」，復擅編新劇，不僅以鼓技名於世也。梅雨田隨老譚南來時，尤虛懷若谷，深恐江南亦有名手，遍詢班中藝友，訪得趙氏之名，乃親往拜謁者三次。兩人一見，成爲契友，凡雨田有所詢，無不盡心敎授。舉凡鑼鼓經，曲牌名，趙氏均以彩筆繪成圖形，加以註釋。居家時，一手握管，埋頭疾書，儼然有大作家風度。</p>
<p>捧角</p>
<p>文人捧角，在從前的報紙上，一篇一篇的文章登出來，往往如荼如火。不用說別的了，即以梅蘭芳而言，試閱張季子九錄，寫給他的信眞不少。張季直還有一篇「後洛神賦」，也是爲梅蘭芳而作的，說什麼「神光飄颻於越女，餘音繚繞於韓娥」，比他的金殿對策還做得好。朱古微與況　風同觀梅劇，臺上正演「彩櫻配」，兩人在臺下聯起句來，有「恨不將身作叫化，天蟾咫尺在天涯，可憐你我不如他」之詞。最後一句爲「萬分無奈且回家」。可謂傾倒之至。</p>
<p>有一個時期，在淸末民初，捧的是馮春航和賈璧雲，在南社叢刋中，還留下不少的詩詞。</p>
<h3>上海伶人團體</h3>
<p>精忠廟是北平的伶人團體，廟首一幟，都由伶界第一流人物担任，像程長庚楊月樓等，不但劇藝超人一等，即對於梨園一行的遠離故鄉，覓　數千里外，舉目無親，夏氏乃仿北平精忠廟之辦法，籌創公所。</p>
<p>當時南方伶人的組織，限於崑班，而崑班伶人的梨園公所則在蘇州，上海的梨園團體，這可算是首創的了。梨園公所純粹是平劇伶人的同業組織，但也有少數的崑班伶人像周鳳林·邱蕊卿等參加，因當時崑班已日趨衰落，伶人稀少，故不得不投到皮　班裏去。</p>
<p>梨園公所　伶人的福地</p>
<p>梨園公所在城內西木橋附近，是一所兩進的平房，內供祖師爺神龕，每逢朔望，伶人都要前來敬香。平日在東邊側門內進出，祇有祖師爺誕辰一天，大開正門，很有一番盛况。</p>
<p>革以後，梨園公所改爲伶界聯合會，因當時聯合會十分風行，凡屬一業，即有一業的聯合會，梨園公所亦改此稱。會長爲潘月樵。當時潘氏頗有革命思想。二次革命，曾參與其謀，並將軍火貯存於聯合會中。及贛寗變起，潘氏出奔湖北，依黎元洪避禍，伶界聯合會因官廳仇視，亦無形解散。直至雲南舉義，成立護法政府，伶界聯合會才再度抬頭，改選夏月潤爲會長。</p>
<p>這上海梨園同業的唯一組織，中間曾經過不少波折，始成爲今日伶人的「福地」。內部有義學·公墓·寡婦糧·貧老糧·公寓·喪葬等各項公益事業，每月支出頗有可觀。</p>
<p>榛苓小學　梨園的義學</p>
<p>榛苓小學乃一梨園的義學，由潘月樵夏月潤發起，最早的校長爲吳人歐陽煦，後來改由孫玉聲接任，頗造就幾個人材。後又在會中延請老伶工，敎授一班貧苦無告的子弟，俾得習藝爲他日糊口之資，　然是個科班了</p>
<p>上海梨園同業組織，在潘夏兩氏銳意經營之下，漸有進展。對於失業同人的安插，殘廢老　的救濟，同業爭執的排解，二人不厭煩瑣，任勞任怨，造福伶界，至深且鉅。迄後麒麟童·林樹森等，亦先後出任會長，綱承其遺志。</p>

<h3>配紗制度之演進　實用額與配售額無法接近　複配工作亦感覺困難重重</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕復員以來，紗布市面最爲多事，今年春季，價尚平疲。夏秋以還，始形猖獗，其間紗價幾成直綫之上漲，布價則變化較多。即以最近四星期來而言，紗價儘管堅昂，布疋之廠盤，却不夠成本。上星期四，社會局所召開之布價審議會，成本與市價對照，前者仍較後者爲低。五六日以前，布廠呌苦者比比皆是。因布雖滯銷，廠內却不便停工。棉紗不繼，不得不向紗廠開進。而紗廠之售價，並不如布廠之可削本也。日來布號紗號之虧倒者屢有所聞。布廠一方面須負担高利貸，同時又常常以不敷成本之價格開布，以求資金之周轉，內底空虛者亦日增。業中人每以「擺平」二字形容廠號之斷氣。則今冬之擺平者當屬不少矣。布廠及其他棉紗複製工業鑒於危機之嚴重，自春季起，即發爲平定紗價，互保合法利潤之運動。</p>
<p>聯配之開始　八月三十日，終於在經濟部王部長之主持下，由紡織事業管理委員會飭國營紡織建設公司及民營各紗廠，辦理聯合配售。議定月撥紗三萬件，國營出三分之一，民營出三分之二。九月份之一個月內，表面上尚能維持。而國營仍在紡建掛牌，大廠小廠往往無暇分等配售。民營則配售之法，日漸引起各方之指責。十月份雖勉强仍照原法開配，而黑市日漲，實用廠家及正常紗號受配日難。其原定之月撥三萬件，落於實用廠家者究有多少，發配及承配者，均無從指明其確實之數字也。且照紗廠公會之配售方法，先接請購單子，旁晚始開出價格。請購者事前無從知悉價格，開價後又不能退單。甚至牌價是牌價，賣價是賣價。用紗之户，焦頭爛額。紗廠業中明達之人未嘗不欲糾正之，而頭緒萬端，久久未果。</p>
<p>配售之改進　十月下旬，紗布益漲。紡管會主任委員東雲章氏頗感棘手。乃向上級機關言辭，由吴市長兼任。吴兼主任視事之始，即發動改變配售機構。責成染織·針織·內衣·毛巾被毯·手帕織造·手工棉織等複製品工業之同業公會自行承辦分配事宜。每期由紗廠公會即第六區棉紡工業同業公會繕表撥紗，交由各該複製品工業公會所合組之棉紗複製品工業公會配紗委員會督率各該本體公會，按其己呈報紡管會之册子分配。於是實際辦理配售之工作，乃加在受配廠家自組之複配會肩上，此在配售機構上，可謂一大轉變。而成效如何，尚待事實證明。惟各方有一共同之信念，咸認爲一種改進。即紗廠對此，亦感覺興味。紡建當局尤以或可減少誤會，深表贊助。</p>
<p>複配會之困難　在複配會方面，以常理言，宜可表示滿足矣。但熟知其內容者，據謂亦十分感覺困難。其一爲責任之來，出於倉卒。籌備之工作不足，分配之公允不易。二星期以來，配售二次，其複配會之本部，及各個本體公會，均出全力以應付此事。猶感到難以放心。對於漏未申報，不及參加配給者，尤覺愛莫能助，情有不安。小廠向之以軋紡建紗爲業者，今複配會按實用之多寡爲衡，既無法沾光。大廠因紡管會祇按六折撥配，仍說太不夠用。從下次起，將在原撥配額內酌量分配與補行申報之各廠。而粥少僧多，將愈感不週。其二爲紗之來源出於紗廠，支數之搭配，棧單之出貨，底裏困苦，據說一言難盡。如再不能獲得誠懇之諒解，難免無其他之變端。</p>
<p>此次之新辦法　今日（十一）爲第三期第三次開配之日。第三期者，　九月份之第一期而言也。總數仍撥六千件有零，前晚己由紡管會行文與複製品業。當局之意，每月分四次撥配，並不以星期劃分。第二次偶擇爲每個星期一，如一成不變，將使一個月超過四次。故以後將爲本月二十一日及十二月一日。此事當局曾於事前商得複配會同意。此辦法之改變者一。配額仍爲原數，而補行申報之廠家亦將受配。則原有各户之配額將更減少。而補配各户所得到將仍不滿意。此事經複配會商得紡管會同意者，亦是不得己之通融辦法。此辦法之改變者二。原配及補報受配各廠，其資格及用量標準，皆重經審查，且核減不少。預料將有若干補報者仍未能受配，若干原配廠減低標準。此亦複配會已經稟承紡管會之指示，從嚴辦理者。此辦法之改變者三。</p>
<p>今後尚須改善　據紡管會及複配會消息，此次仍是臨時之通融辦法。十二月份當有較切實之改善。照複配會資料，將增加三分之一之配量。對於不在本市直接複製成品者，將澈底整理。而各廠實用之額，將較爲接近於實際。據有資格者指稱，必須紗廠予以合作，諸事方有辦法。</p>
<h3>紗業公會理事長談　紗管政策之影響</h3>
<p>據紗業公會理事長唐志良對記者談，關於棉紗黑市，紡管會己採取强制政策，故價格雖形減低，但尚未能完全消滅，廠商居間商均已接受吴市長四項措施，但對方於價每件一百七十五萬，多退少補辦法，紡管會意見是廠商直接補給棧單持單人，但依照商人之意見，則應補給抬頭人，蓋廠商將棧單買給抬頭人（居間商）抬頭人再標售予持單人，可能是用户或居間商，例如黑市紗價二百二十萬時，抬頭人向廠商購棧單一紙，但當抬頭人再賣於持單人時，黑市價格又起變動，或漲或跌，則由持單人直接向廠商照一百七十五萬退還三十五萬，實欠公平合理。其實依商業習慣來說，交易一成，吃虧便宜，各不相涉，最多本次損失太大，下次交易之價格上，雙方同意設法補足，而決不能改變前次交易之價格，故多退少補，雖然有利於本業，但按之習慣與商人信用，則不無影響，故此辦法實行以來，居間商己很難購得現貨，所購得者皆爲二星期之期貨，以目前高利貸二星期利息計算，則己加至一百八十九萬，本人曾與吴市長談及此事，吴市長以爲渠可以命令廠商，只許售出現貨，如售期貨，當以一角半拆息照扣，但如此進行，廠商可以拒不售出，則居間商更難買到棉紗，絕非辦法，目前廠商己紛紛計劃運往外地，另尋出路，如此下去，外埠紗價可以下跌，而本市紗荒則將更嚴重。</p>
<h3>錢兑業　營存款業務　擬一律改銀號</h3>
<p>本市錢兑業自政府規定美鈔價格後，交易沉寂，該業前曾呈請中央銀行准予恢復戰前小工商存放業務，並要求八點（一）小工商存放以己登記之一百八十五家錢兑莊爲限，（二）防止同業頂替，不准更換主人，（三）仿錢業制度，以便主管機關查核，（四）交存款百分之二十于中央銀行，（五）錢兑店一律改爲銀號，（六）以前執照繼續有効，（七）規定各號最低資本額，（八）仿杭州錢兑業辦法，兼作貨幣兑換，據錢兑業理事長汪雲程稱，以上八條，己得中央銀行總裁面允云。</p>
<h3>聯合配銷會　棉紗折算法</h3>
<p>棉紗聯合配銷會開售棉紗，以二十支爲標準，但各廠開售未必盡是標準紗，如本期二十支紗僅三，三七五件，其餘各支均有，至於折算方法，據該會負責人稱：係根據七月份各該廠實開紡錠數，詳細審核，規定折算方法，茲舉方式如下：</p>
<p>一〇支一八七·五%　一六支　一二五%</p>
<p>二〇支　一〇〇%　三二支　七五%</p>
<p>四二支　六〇%</p>
<p>上項折算數，係以二十支紗爲百分比例，假定紗廠本期應攤二十支紗爲一百件，如以十六支或三十二支等紗法分别增減，即十六支應攤一二五件，三二支應攤七五件云。</p>
<h3>聯總供給牛羊　計劃並未打消　數量略爲減少</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕聯總供給我國牛羊之計劃，前因購買之不易，有取消之税；茲據關係方面確息，原計劃並未打消，惟經費己由原定之五百萬美金，減少至六十萬至一百萬元之間。本年十二月份，可望有四百冰龍乳牛運抵我國，聯總原定由澳大利亞供給我國牛八百頭，現己改爲供給牛四百頭，另四百頭改用羊一千頭抵償。除此之外，聯總擬接濟水牛一千頭。將來此項畜類運抵我國後，水牛擬出售，乳牛乳羊則撥交農林部。</p>
<h3>配糧發現攙雜　公司調查真相</h3>
<p>關於本市第一期計口配糖，發現攙雜一節，頗引起社會人士之注意，據該公司負責人語記者，本期計口糖第一批，共出中砂七千九百六十二包，由本市南貨業公會分别派員至招商局第二碼頭及第五碼頭出貨，並由該會出貨負責人逐包扦樣後出棧，當時均係純粹台糖，至該項配糖出棧後，忽有攙雜情事發生，該公司認爲非常詫異，現正嚴密澈查真相，以明責任云。</p>
<h3>水汀管　拆毁多.來貨少　準備裝置者極爲寥落</h3>
<p>（本報訊）冬令轉瞬即届，惟水汀管之市況，仍未見起色。據五金業中人談：敵偽時期，本市各大廈，公寓，旅館等所有水汀設置，被拆殆盡。惟目前以煤價奇昂，而水汀設備之裝置，價亦不廉。同業方面，又多缺貨。故開始恢復裝置者，幾屬絕無僅有。勝利後，外洋到貨，僅慎昌及卜內門洋行等，曾裝到水汀管子少許，至原隻之水汀座及爐子等均未有貨到。據告：半時徑之水汀管子，在貨缺時，每呎市價一度曾達三千元。最近市價，每呎爲二萬元。一時徑者，每呎二千六百元。最大之六吋徑水汀管，每呎二萬元。此中以小口徑之管子，比較暢銷。至原隻之水汀座，均係　每片之面積大小，而計價。普通水汀座，每片面積，自三方呎至五方呎不等。每方呎之同行批發價，約爲美金一元。市面售價，每方呎約合美金二元之譜。據估計：普通二下二上之洋房一幢，裝置全副泗汀設備，包括水汀管子，水汀座，及爐子等在內，約需三千萬元。如此昂價，即洋房階級，殆亦將望而却步矣。</p>
<h3>四種公債還本　今日在滬抽籤</h3>

<h3>麵粉業的呼聲　日常買賣有限　利潤太薄不夠維持開支</h3>
<p>麵粉一業，除開製造的廠商以外，還有麵粉經銷商又分做批發和零售兩業。批發商向麵數值廠　到麵粉後，一小部份，是轉賣給零售商零星售出，大部份則售給南北洋各幫。因爲上海是麵粉的大宗產地，戰前上海各粉廠每天產粉總數，有十萬包左右，所以批發商的營業，相當發達。而且批發商大都是麵粉交易所的經紀人，還代客買賣期貨，因此他的業務，更加繁榮了</p>
<p>八一三滬戰爆發後，麵交停業。期貨買賣無法進行，但是現貨還是照常可做。後來戰區逐漸擴大，營業當然不免受其影響，然而還不致十分衰落。迨至太平洋戰事發生，上海全部淪入敵人的手中，各種重要物資，都統制起來，麵粉是主要食糧，當然要受到嚴格的統制，因此便無法自由買賣，批發商的業務便停頓了，零售商不得不來賣賣配給粉，掙扎着勉維生活。</p>
<p>抗戰勝利後，麵粉經銷商都懷着極大的希望，捲土重來，憧憬着戰前的營業，紛紛宣告復業。粉麩商業同業公會，也組織起來了。加入的會員，共有三百餘家。其中批發商約佔四分之一，零售商佔着四分之三，但是上海各粉廠的出品，不是自己買了小麥來製的，却都是善後經濟總　交給小麥委託代製，直接流向民間，全不經過麵粉商人之手。好在這時麵粉商便向無錫蘇州等地運一些雜牌粉到上海來銷售。至今年小麥登場時，各粉廠除代製善救署的救濟粉外，自己也採辦了小麥製粉出售，今年小麥的收成尚好，所以在五六月間，粉價還算平定。雖則價格不免陸續上漲，但是其他物價都在狂漲，比較起來，粉價的上升，不好算得例外。可是我國麵粉，單靠國產小麥來製造是不夠的。戰前每年在秋季，都靠着大批的洋麥進口來補充，所以數月之後，小麥的出數漸漸的少了，價格也漸漸的高了。於是粉價也隨着步步上升。當局爲顧念民食起見，於八月十九日起，限止零售粉價，每包不得超過一萬四千三百元。後來稍提至一萬四千七百元，並且責令各粉廠每日供給本埠零銷麵粉九千包。可惜那時候只禁止麵粉出口，而小麥依然可以出口，結果因小麥存　日薄，好的價格便漲到每担將近四萬元，而規定各廠每日配出的九千包，有時不能足數星期日又是停配的，供不應求，惟有向外埠販　補充。而外埠也因爲麥價日高，粉價也漲，因此單是運到上海的成本，每包己需一萬八千餘元。商人輾轉販運目的，本在圖利，況且目前利息高得駭人，一切的一切，都是轉嫁與買客，這樣便產生了所謂黑市了。</p>
<p>現在當局也阴暸存麥的枯乏，准許廠商暫時將粉價提高到每包二萬元，加上車運上下力三百元，利潤二百元，零售價每包爲二萬〇五百元。每天粉廠配出，須維持一萬二千包的數量，小麥也禁止出口了，由公會將這種配售粉，指定一百餘家零售店代辦配售，只能賣給各種以麵粉製造商品的商家，如麵包.餅干.切麵.大餅.油條以及點心，饅頭等各種商店，一概憑證購粉，所得利潤則平均分派三百會員。此外從外埠運來的麵粉，雖可自由買賣，但是每包價格，也不得超過二萬〇五百元，這樣一來，黑市當然絕跡了。</p>
<p>但是，麵粉經銷商如何呢？現在同業共有三百餘家，　每天一萬二千包（按照最近各業麵粉數量每日統扯六七千包），麵粉每包利潤二百元，還要貼給指定配粉的零售商每包一百元，實際到手的只有每包一百元，即使以一萬二千包，共一百二十萬元，三百家平均分派，每天只有四各元，每月除去星期日四天不配粉外，只有二十六天，每家每月共得十萬餘元，現在麵粉商家大的有夥友十餘人，小的二三人不等，　區區十萬餘元，呌他們作什麼用呢？</p>
<p>照上面說來，那末那一百餘家指定經配麵粉的零售店，不是另外有每包一百元的貼費嗎？但是他們經配麵粉，是要墊款的。現在利率這樣高出了，至少一角半的利息，借了錢來墊款，倘使今天付款提貨，明天便賣完了，倒也不致於白做。不過事實上隔了二三天，他的粉還是　去了少數，零配商又不能將粉賣給别人，只得暗貼利息。</p>
<p>因此麵粉商家狠希望當局對於規定的利潤，還得調整一下，對於現在的配售辦法，也希望考慮改善。</p>
<h3>去年所利得税記帳問題</h3>
<p>— 甘允壽</p>
<p>三十四年度所利得税簡化稽征，業經税收當局，與商會負責人幾席磋商結果，己決定按去年結出淨利，再加百分之五十　徴，我人站在税法税理立場來觀察，當然不能認爲合理，不過當局爲適合税收預算起見，亦祇好不顧法理而施行，但回顧工商機關因去年帳目時隔己久，淨利早經分派，對於支付該項税收，在帳册上，不無引起許多疑問，　就所見，略論於後，藉供各業參考：</p>
<p>查三十四年度各業所得淨利多己分派，在分派前，間有依法提存税款，但決不會超過該年淨利。現届支付税款，則須觀各業情形，而異其會計處理。茲列舉三種情形於後：</p>
<p>第一種情形——即各業帳上如列有公積或盈餘滾存等項，而其數額，超過該年度税款時，即可將是項公積盈餘，與應會税款相對　，其借貸分錄，即爲借記公積或盈餘滾存貸記應付税款。假定某公司三十四年度，計獲淨利一百萬元，而該年度應繳税款則爲一百五十萬元。但所有淨利，業己悉數分派，其帳上提有應付税款四十萬，公積一百二十萬元。此時應付税款尚差一百十萬元，應由公積中借記一百十萬元，貸記應付税款一百十萬元。</p>
<p>第二種情形——帳上雖示有公積盈餘滾存，但不能抵銷該年度應納税款。此項差額，可轉入前期損益整理數，或捐税項下，列作三十五年度之損失，或轉入暫付款項，以待日後有盈餘時轉銷。如上舉某公司之公積祇有五十萬元，除抵充應付税款外，尚不足六十萬元則可將不足之數，借入前期損益整理數，或捐税或暫付款項項下可也。</p>
<p>第三種情形——帳上所列公積，或盈餘滾存數額極小，甚或既無公積盈餘，又無應付税款之列示。則就本人之意，應將該年度淨利與資本，算出依法應納税款，借入資本主往來，或應收税款項下由資本主或股東負責繳付。因該年度之淨利，既爲股東悉數分派，又不酌予提存保留企業，理應向股東追回，至其與税局規定相差之數，仍可借入前期損益整理數，或捐税，或暫付款項項下。如某公司依法應納税款爲四十萬元，但應繳税款則爲一百五十萬元。其分錄應爲借記資本主往來，或應收税款四十萬元，及前期損益整理數一百十萬元貸記應付税款一百五十萬元可也。</p>
<p>上舉三種情形，當然以能有公積盈餘者，與應付税款相抵充爲最佳。如不能抵銷時，則惟有與前期損益整理數或捐税轉帳，列作三十五年度之損費爲宜。蓋所得税之課征，照理應在淨利之下，絕無超出純利以上之理，今政府以幣值變動，遲收税款，以及收支不能適合爲理由，超出淨利課徴，自亦有其不得己之苦衷在。但工商業之虧盈實税，要亦爲無可掩飾之事實。故要人認爲超出依法應納税額，而列入三十五年度損費項下，亦並無不當之處。至列入暫付款項，則純爲一種穩健對策，設日後税收當局，如允許列作損費，即可與暫付款項相轉消，否則惟有等待有盈餘時再行抵充也。</p>

<h3>試種桐樹　美洲氣候不適　英非印澳等處亦失望</h3>
<p>路透社倫敦消息，帝國學會卜雷氏最近提出論文，曾謂：全部商業桐油之供應量，向來自中國，惟該國大部份產量，仍輸往美國，一九四六年首六月中，中國出口量僅及四.〇〇〇噸，美國遠在一九〇五年，即己着手桐油生產事宜，美國桐油公司，曾不斷參照早期試種方法改進，刻美境種植桐樹面積，己達一〇〇·〇〇〇英畝，惟美洲大陸以有霜降過早之慮，故非桐油生產之理想地帶，一九四三年美國桐油產量，僅及二，三〇〇〇噸，一九四四年竟減至一·一〇〇噸，英帝國對桐樹試種，己遍及帝國各部，迨至一九三三年，試種結果仍多令人失望。一九三九年南非洲桐樹產汕一五噸，一九四三年油產數字雖己高達二七〇噸，但結果仍不夠欣慰，目前尼亞　蘭（Nyasa　land）之年產量，亦不過六十噸左右，印度桐產，雖一度試辦，但迄乏大規模之商業經營，緬甸桐產亦有較好之希望，由各地土著紳耆倡導之植桐面積，己達七五〇英畝，一九三八至三九年間，緬甸曾有六二噸桐籽輸出，澳洲亦曾致力於實騐工作，但結果似不足道云。</p>
<h3>玉門油礦近況　新機器不久可到</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕有關人士告記者：最近石油之進口數量較少，乃由運輸不便之故。主管機關對於發展玉門油礦，甚爲重視。戰後第一批由美國運華之機器己抵洛陽，一個月後可到礦區，届時生產量當能提高。前此在隴海東綫所損失之鍋鑪，當設法補充。最近因氣候關係，玉門產油量略減。該礦所生產之油，如有設備加以精煉，可供航空之用；但目前之方針，雖不忽略品質，提高產量更爲重要。在東北方面，日本過去在錦州辦有一規模甚大之煉油廠，惜重要機器於勝利後己被搬走，石油公司目前己加以保管整頓，明年經補充後始能開工。至於撫順油岩煉油之工程，尚未加以恢復；過去日人雖有此項試騐，但生產成本甚高。</p>
<h3>石油公司派員　探測台灣油源</h3>

<h3>優良私小得改代用國民學校　教部已訂辦法</h3>
<p>〔本報南京九日電〕敎部爲積極推動國民敎育，力謀普及起見，特依照國民學校法成規，訂定一種「代用國民學校辦法」，通令全國各省市敎育行政當局遵辦。聞此項代用國民學校，意在使尙未普遍設立國民學校之縣市，其私立小學，辦理成績優良，經縣市主管機關考核屬實，並商得私小校董會同意，得就設校所在地，分別改名爲「縣」「市」「鄉」「鎭」「保」代用國民學校，仍由其隸屬之縣市政府，或院轄市之主管敎育行政機關管理，監督，指導。茲將其組織，經費，人事，名義各方面，探誌如下：</p>
<p>組織方面在原來私立小學，以施行單純之學齡兒童敎育爲限，自改代用國民學校，照章分設兒童敎育，與失學民衆敎育兩部。兒童敎育，以辦理一二三四年級爲原則，如有可能，亦得設五六年級。失學民衆敎育，以辦理初級成人班與婦女班爲原則，必要時，亦得設高級班。旣經改爲代用國民學校之後，則課程，敎材，設備，敎職員，及一切設施，皆照國民學校及中心國民學校法規辦理。</p>
<p>經費方面</p>
<p>私小改爲代用國民學校後，其經費，即由其縣市或院轄之市主管敎育行政機關祖負，但私立小學原有財產，仍由其校董會管理，不得收歸公有。</p>
<p>人事方面</p>
<p>私小改爲代用國民學校後，其校長由縣市政府委派，但原有之校長敎員，並非資格不合，或有國民學校敎職員任用待遇進修保障辦法第十二條各款情形之一者，仍以繼續留任爲原則。</p>
<p>名義方面</p>
<p>如主管敎育行政機關取消其代用名義，或私立小學請求回復其私立性質，均須經主管敎育行政機關與私小校董會之同意，得回復其私立。又私小校董會不願繼續辦理，並將學校所有財產捐贈公家，得取消代用二字，改爲國民學校。</p>

<h3>杭州鬧着誤樂荒</h3>
<p>— 本報派員儲裕生</p>
<p>十一月一日杭州訊</p>
<p>今年的初秋機如盛豆、中秋以後、淅淅瀝瀝的下着雨，使人感着凄涼的冷寂。因此，滿覺龍的桂花被無情的雨打得僅　幾辦枝華，湖　的划子没精打彩地招呼着来往的人。</p>
<p>這幾天，已是秋天的未稍了，杭州的天氣是晴空萬里，溫暖如春。轉可愛的杭州的秋天，竟在初冬將至前露了臉，整天堆滿笑。蘇堤白堤上碧綠的濃蔭，正如西子披上了深然的外套。上海的人一看天候溫暖，在整日煩　中，抽着空络络绩續地又上杭州来，於是旅馆又客满了，土增商店和飮食舖生意又好起来了，划子·湖濱的马扶·精　，也都笑逐颜开了。</p>
<p>像个美丽的姑娘　没受过深湛修养</p>
<p>西溪看　化，九十八　看枫叶，这正是最好的时候。</p>
<p>有人说：「杭州的熱鬧在春秋兩季，因爲春秋季氣候溫暖，西子湖風景宜人，大家願意來杭州玩一下。」又有人說「杭州的好，只好在風景上，其他都談不上。」我要問：「杭州真的只好在風景上面嗎？」是的，杭州的外貌與實質沒有配合起來。記得浙省政府組織的市政考察團團長貢沛誠先生，有一天，他特地問我對於杭州是個美麗的姑娘，但她的靈魂還沒有受過深湛的修養，因此，這位美麗的姑娘，僅能看着而已，而不能與她談論。」</p>
<p>今天要使這位美麗的姑娘有修養，當然要做的事情很多，但娛樂問題確也是挺重要的一點。我會碰見幾位來杭州的人，他們幾乎異口同場的說：「到杭州來，白天遊由玩水，晚上如果沒有月亮，只好關門睡覺。」</p>
<p>低劣戲目賣滿座歌女唱靡之音</p>
<p>杭州在戰前，裏西湖有一個大禮堂，映着高尚的電影，你跑進這座影院，就禁止你磕瓜子。可見這座影座的觀眾是夠得土水，演出過很好的話劇。同時，在西子湖濱，有一個體育場，很多人下辦公室後，在那裏運動。戰後呢，逢勃一時較低級的跳舞廳表演文明戲，歌女唱着靡靡之音的歌，各家戲院都演着一種陳舊不堪的戲，尤其電影院裏　，還映着「夜半歌场」，「三星伴月」等片子，有的更搬演「双珠鳳」，「碧言　」，「金粉世家」，「珍珠塔」，「孟　君」，「梁山伯祝英台」等影片，恨不得把「火燒紅連寺」也搬上銀幕，雖然杭州的戲院電影院演映着這樣的戲，但是觀眾還是十分擁擠。一家專演「珍珠塔」之類影片的電影院，幾乎天天客滿。最可怪的，即是在堂堂一條中正路（原名迎柴路）上，有一塊空白場，變做了傀儡戲的地方，這個演傀似戲的集團，生意相當好，可是他們僅搭一些盧蓆棚，門前掛兩塊小木板，上面貼一些紅紙，寫着戲碼，敲　打鼓，作爲號召觀眾的不二法門。還有各家茶館店裏的說書，也是今天杭州市民重要的休閒教育。</p>
<p>湖濱的體育場呢？被敵偽蓋起了房屋，賸下的一塊土地，因爲主管這場地的沒有錢，不能好好的　築，城內的公共體育場，蔓草沒腥。因此，許多好球隊來到杭州進玩，也無法下場，爲這美麗的湖山州下一點佳話。</p>
<p>娛樂的高尚與低落，可以看州一個地方的文化水準。如果抗州市的娛樂沒有方法把他提高水準，那麼，杭州將是一個徒有美麗外表而實質愚蠢的姑娘，甚至她會漸漸地趨向下流。</p>
<p>市長談起新計劃　造成束方好萊塢</p>
<p>我曾爲這事同市長周金廣先生談過，他說：他有計劃將杭州成爲束方的好萊塢，地點在九溪十八　一帶，那裏可以　築數十條馬路，建造若干幢房屋，不過還得要有眼光的人肯捨得投資。其次是運動塲，他的意思在松木塲有一片場地！從前預備作爲騎射場的，現在荒蕪了，可以作爲運動塲。他又約了工務局長沈景初先生陪我去看過，而且指給我看：如何佈置成個格局。我概得這個辦法果好，計劃尤其好，但嫌太慢了。而且，目前誰肯出汰樣大的一筆金錢來投資於這種事業呢？</p>
<p>現花，我要具體的提出：應該使湖濱的省已教館的體育塲，由政府撥款重行修理，如果因爲地方太窄，那麼應駭建築一個較好的藍球場，這個藍球塲應該有更及室與看臺。如果再有人說錢從那裏來？我主張舉辦星期球會，每一個星期日賽珠，每次球賽售票，以體育來興辦體育。又有人說恐怕抗州賣不起錢，我說不要賣得太貴，我們可以五百元一張門票，甚至兩百元一張也不妨，如果有好的球隊來，再多賣一些錢，如果有愛好體育的有錢人來杭州，我們可以請他捐一筆。這樣聚沙成塔，焦腋成裘，不久也可以成功了。你不見貴陽有一個很好的球場嗎它是以石頭砌成看臺，最新型的籃框，籃架，可以打排球與打網球的。這便是運用上面所說的辦法產生的。</p>
<p>另外，迎紫路這塊空地，我們要建議，造一個模範的劇塲。關於這個模範劇塲，可先招商承營，市政府盬督，數年後歸市公營。關放其他各種比較低級的娛樂，應該予以積極的改善。</p>
<p>如果娛樂提高了旨趣，體育進動護得了普遍的展開，那慶抗州將不致變爲內容室虛的杭州吧。</p>
<h3>彰化紀程</h3>
<p>— 本報特派員江暮雲</p>
<p>十月廿日台灣航訊</p>
<p>台北是政治經濟的中心，也是特殊化的台省的大太營、職務不能使我離開它。可是在省都所發現的實際問題，確非深人腹地是不能獲得解決的，尤其是民間的低微的音調，在省都始被隔膜的，但卻值得興論的尊重。記者很感謝省黨部宣傳處林處長紫貴，使我得和國是日報編緝主任鄭拯人兄同行，林先生實際上他還是保持他鈞記者底風格，作南遊獵奇，並且要用各個角度來測量各地進展的深度。</p>
<p>桃杉園　四種言語</p>
<p>沒有桃樹的桃園，是台北到南部快車的第一個停車站，三個月前，新竹縣政府被市府趕搬到全縣最北部的小鎮來。全縣有四十萬人口；其中十三萬是廣東客家，有幾萬個高山族的蕃人同施，其餘都是漳泉所夾的太省人。這些人中間，客家使用着客家話，高山族使用原始語言，太省人使用閩南話，記者然則使用現在只勉強通行的普通話。在任何一們集會塲所，對合胞說話，至少使用兩種以上，要不然就沒法使他們瞭解；祇有一種語言是大眾化的—日本話，但這敵性的帶有遺毒的語一言是被禁用了。</p>
<p>日本人在台灣，從來就不准許你講台灣話，他不僅會罰你，而且使用刑其，自受教育起，就沒有給你說台語的機會，他們所企圖語言來同化本省人的辦法，其成效至少已在百分之九十以上。人們一定信實國語在太省顯然獲有大大的進步，但坦白地說，除了各中學在敎室裏講以外，有幾個是在家庭裏使用的？這不能說見失敗，這只能說還淡有啟發省維自發的學習國語的力量，這個力量就是生活的安定和政治的明朗。</p>
<p>台灣人不懂台語，這似是笑話，可是的是實情。在挑園，我曾目覩一個說客家話的主席，他用了一個講閩南話的翻譯，而對不語台語的人來聽，又感扞格了。語言的隔閡，到現在爲止，它已充分說明了言吳隔　，被至是自我隔膜的主因，沒有人不相信國語普反的重要性，但就沒一個人能眞切地做到。</p>
<p>新竹　少年監獄</p>
<p>純日本的新竹市內少年幾務所（少年盬獄），是該市的「特色」之一，全省只此一家，差不多婦孺皆知。記者們在十七日晨特地趕往參觀。水泥砌起的高牆躲在椰子樹的下面，漫長的令人想起德集中營的　面，在這個鐵圈三千七百多坪的小天地裏，狗留着二十歲以下的少年一五三人，成年二七九人，最多時收容到五一八人。每天需要四袋米，用袋蕃薯和其他副食品，平均每個犯人每天可得三六四厘三二的營養資料。前五年日人管理時，少年犯罪數最多的是竊盜三三〇人，其次是詐欺五〇人，通姦古八人，殺人六人，阿片食者四人及其他、光復以後的竊盜犯，還是最多。</p>
<p>典獄長林滋培他讓記者參觀了該所的全部，包括拘押室，教室，運動塲，禮堂，並且看了囚犯們帶着削的枯骨在耕田裏耕作印刷房裏印排裝訂，學習縫衣，做竹工，木工和糊專賣局的香烟厘，這些被決定了命運的囚犯，成天除了一小時運動，一小時上課以外，主要的是以工作打發他失去了自由的日子。有十多個女犯，她然蹲在地上縫着破布衣，活像是個家庭。她們的拘留室更比男犯整潔，清凈。在園子裏，有幾個裸體的少主犯是患有第三期的梅毒，他們幾乎瘦削得像枝竹竿。該所按月支出約十萬，工作的收人可彌補十分之三·四。上半年的收客人數中，死了二十一人，因爲工作和食糧的正常，死亡率很低的。</p>
<p>據獄長的告訴，他很急於希望，省人能恢復組織保護會，（日人定九月十七晶爲司法保護紀念日）在這個會裏，可爲支付出獄者的川寶和介紹職業，他是決不希望他們回來需要計會和政府扶育成長的！</p>
<p>彰化　古老之城</p>
<p>從新竹到彰化，快車三時牛的旅經，這是一條和經過台中鐵路的平行綫底交叉點。因爲到台中需要穿過士多無山洞，其中之一是有五分鐘的時間，爲了怕吃烟煤，旅客都愛走海岸綫。車子在海　經過無數的小丫，經越海濱平源，眺望窗外，右側就是一望無際的藍色的海，白浪緊　着沙灘，肥碩的水牛掠過白業的產花，朝向平野裏走，啊，畢竟是秋天了，這詩意的靜謐的海之邊緣。</p>
<p>一下車，就看到彰化市破敗的留存　戰時的景象，南中國化的有古築下，襯扎着竹棚搭起的攤戶，實買帶零碎的食品，路是石子舖的，滿是泥灰，下午天氣仍煥熟得呌人頭胘。我們首先去看了全省最古老的孔廟，只有大殿巍然獨存，前庭和兩廂都頹敗了，彰化被譽爲文化策源地，但除了有四個中學四個國已學校以外，不再什麽跡象可找的。</p>
<p>王市長對記者說，全市只有六萬人，（市區四萬）。過去有三百個職員，現在全部是一百十人，範圍小，財政還不感困難，按月發薪，市內有二百多貧戶，至多五百人失業，要是離開六公里處的糖廠來年復工了，工作都沒有問題，他說：將彰化作爲自洽市，確很合理想。當地的參議員，要求撤消彰化市，而將台中縣搬過來，理由是五十二年前這裏是縣治，而地處台中中心。</p>
<p>市內有八卦山　日本人將它佈置成風景區，實際上卻只有一個亭，兩個旅社，我們在中央別館裏度過一宵。國美代表之一的郭耀庭先生告訴我，這裏他們蒙過難，二十六年日人逮捕了一千多抗日份子，一部份是在這裏被捕的。山上有自來水源，因蓄水池不夠，全市四千噸一天的水量供應成了問題，下午是停止放水的。</p>
<h3>猪的產況</h3>
<p>— 王寒鷗</p>
<p>本報一日如　訊</p>
<p>最近上海等地豬肉恐慌，市價飛漲，已間有「　無肉」之嘆。提起豬肉，不得不注意它的出產地—蘇北，而　北的大宗產豬地，就在如，靖，　，等縣。目前豬產銳減，情形突變，不但影響江南人的食肉問題，而且還深重打擊蘇北農村的經濟。這突變是跟蘇北一年多的內亂以俱來的。</p>
<p>蘇北重要出口品是糧食，其次是豬，　，鴨，蛋等，以豬好爲最大宗。而豬的大邦出口，有兩淮地帶的淮豬，和本縣一帶的壯豬。此較起來，壯豬肉較鮮嫩，因爲牠的食料者是大麥，豆餅，豬草等，富於滋養，才能長是什鑿意思，就是得點養肥　因。種地最多的人家，養豬最多，有一家養豬二三十口的；能養這麼多豬的人家，一定是中農和富農。家鏡一定不壞</p>
<p>像本縣西鄕一帶農家，養二三十口豬的原來就很不少，這中中的道理就是水縣人口密度多，耕地少，濃民獲有游資買不到地．就喜歡養豬來增加生產，養諸的條件是搭屋，砌造諾圈，存備大麥，豆餅，買小豬，或者養一隻老母豬，留養不時下種，預算一下，養一圈豬，可要得多少本錢？</p>
<p>養獨時，每天大早要起身刈豬草，磨大麥　，兩樣和起來放在鍋事煮熟，一桶桶餵給豬吃，一天要　兩三次，到錯長成「二卡子」（己經半大）需要長肥時，才磨豆餅曆給豬吃豬吃了豆餅就不喜歡吃其他食料，但豆餅成本大，所以農家非到長大需要出賣時，決不輕易給牠吃。</p>
<p>如果壯豬染了瘟疫，這農家一番辛苦和本錢，就完全化爲烏有。農人無不把豬好視爲自己的子女和生命，鄕間並且流行　種種養豬迷信。又因爲豬變是農家的重要財富，兒女做親時，先訪訪這一家圈裏的壯豬有多少。如　酉鄉一帶農民，勤苦養生產，每家　，養豬　甚多，家家富　，所以從前有「金加　」之稱。</p>
<p>豬隻養到牛途，家裏出了事，需要用錢，就隨詩把豬隻，「過」給人家，比較種田還便當。到豬長火了出賣給豬販時，叫着「出圈」還请鄰鄰友家來吃「合食」，以爲慶賀；猪款要分期付，販子還祇給他「票子」，　上許多大的期，給他來一層剝削。但濃民也不怎樣反對，因爲豬「出圈」了，獲得大批現款，容易漫藏誨盜，不如那「票子」在手，慢慢到街上換糧食或其他物品，強盜刦去「票子」也是沒用處。</p>
<p>偽「中儲券」流行時，通貨極度膨賬，物價不斷上漲狡猾的投機商人，便創取滑頭商號，專做「票子」生意，把農民的現款套去，而給濃民　期的「票子」自己囤貨或放拆息，到俊民拿「票子」兌觀的時候，貨價已經漲了許多，農民有時也計算不出這上面的損失，大江南北開匯劃莊，吃「票子」飯的商人，也不知餐活了許多，和他們所有的家小。並且猶「票子」流來流去，有時也影饗各地的「銀根」和市價漲洛，可見蘇北壯獨關係市場經濟之宜。</p>
<p>在淪陷期間，敵偽下鄉　蕩，農村豬雙等副產損失雖多，但農民還是縱續兼　；因爲這關係他們的生活和財富，他們爲了生存的掙扎，紙有奮門到底，所以那時雖因爲交通的關係，江南各地豬肉時有脫節，但也不像現在這樣的的恐慌嚴重。現在豬荒情形，是有着另一個重大原因：</p>
<p>常蘇北兵軍去年「解放」了如皋幾個城市後，他便注意到猪隻出口为蘇北主要經濟一環，列爲他的「工商管理」之一，把產猪的如皋幾們縣份，劃爲」蘇　一分区」，管理猪也出口，套取怯幣外匯。但死農民因爲不相信他的「抗幣」和管制政策，都偷偷的和豬商直接談生意，每担猪換大麥或生油若干，麥和油在售猪回來時交割，可是豬商杷壯猾運到上海賣出法幣，回來和「華中银行」換成「抗幣」的時候，大麦價己经大漲特漲，一隻猶常常掉了半隻豬都不到，那些存心不良的豬版子，就「溜之大吉」！晨民吃倒賬，沒有大麥喂豬，嘗然影響養豬生產了，這是最初原因之一。</p>
<p>其次，自今年春初「解放區」所養開的各項　動：「鬥學」，養豬的人家沒有遭受敵偽深重的蹂躪，一定「有勾搭」，罰他的糧食和豬雙等等；「救災」，養豬的人家存有多數大麥，請他事一部份來「救災」；「分田」，田地分散了，沒有中農和商農，大家沒有養多數豬　的資格了。此外農已因爲壓惡「解放區」，從今年春夏間，把壯豬大批出口，在收復區換成資金，就逃亡在外面，不把資金流回去，壯豬產量，自遭受深重的打擊而銳減了。這現象，在夏天豬雙大批向外傾出的時候，大家還不感覺得到，直至目前「圖窮七見」，饑重情形，才呈露出來。</p>
<p>加之，目前蘇北兵馬遍地，交通不暢！客軍　集，耗費肉量激增；祇有消費，沒有生產，長此下去，雖不至完全絕種，但今後江南北人肉食前途，實不容樂觀。所以月前唯一要圖，就是速迅綏靖地方，使各地鄕民早日歸農；並由政府設法貸款扶　，恢復養豬生產；這也是今後安定農村救濟濃民的重要施策之一。</p>

<h3>集寗會戰插曲</h3>
<p>— 本報記者宋紹柏</p>
<p>十月五日豐鎮訊</p>
<p>將軍在第一綫</p>
<p>十二戰區的高級將領，都沒有裝腔效勢的希特動神氣，除了傳長官以外，軍師閱長都有外號。戰友們拿外號代替姓名，當官的不以爲先污辱，而感覺非常親切。他們平日和　兵共同坐活，戰時也和士兵們站在一條綫上殺伐。例如「勵進」縱隊長黃其武將軍的指揮位置，始終在敞人的砲彈射瞿以內；「復興」縱隊長孫闌蜂將軍，會指揮白靈廟，忻口，包類，五原諸役，腿部受過重傷，外號人稱「拐將軍」，此次集寗會戰，他在步兵沒有到達以前就親自帶着騎兵攻城，以　雪今年一月十三日停戰命令下達後，共軍用五萬步兵從國軍五千驕兵手中，奪取集寗的仇恨。</p>
<p>「勝利」副支隊長王建眾少將親自帶領兩個中險突城，在一次觀外對內職爭就很少看見；而「風進」的副縱隊長劉萬春中將更飽到小隊的位置上去指揮。劉萬者中將在這次集寗會戰中，可以說踏遍城外的山地，穿過城內的街巷。條看見那一個部隊頓挫，就跑到那裏替官長川主義，給土兵打氣。一個中隊長的戰鬥任務，由一側副縱隊長幫助他指揮，焉能打不了勝仗。士兵看見中將跟他們並肩作戰，如何不勇往直前。「國光」支隊長郭景雲少將在十二日夜晚被共軍製　指揮所時，曾親自投擲手張將敵人擊退；「青山」支隊長鄂友三少將，每次衝鋒時，都是騎在馬上打槍。</p>
<p>傳長官於去年歸綏被團時，曾在八里莊前綫，被共軍的子彈穿破大衣。大同受困後，他單機並往鼓舞士然，亦被擊中機翼。這次集寗會戰時，他四　夜沒有睡覺。長官部的高級幕僚，都把眼睛熬紅。十四日共軍還在集寗外圖，和我們的追擊部隊混戰，傅長官就跑到集家君顧官兵，撫慰已眾。二十四日敵人雖然撤出大司的飛機塲，但沙嶺以東仍有共軍機據，他是第一個飛到大同，慰勞守城的將士。使綏遠和雁北的軍民，每個人都惑覺「我們的長官，永遠和我們站在一起」。</p>
<p>執行小組所見</p>
<p>軍調都的集寗小組，在集寗會戰時還儲在城裏。越初共軍對美方代表　奎土，政府代表尹漢初，和十二戰區的迎絡官五越，派兵嚴密臨視。用　備入的姿勢，不槍對凖每個人的　口，好　法警有守犯人。所以　全士要求把美國的國旗，掛在執行小組的房上，克遭共軍拒絕，後來國軍突人與密，姚喆由「紛軍區」司令部被我們逐出，把指揮所設在執行小組的牆下，才允許美國旗抽劉屋頂。使砲彈不致在附近落下。姚喆好像屋星跟土月亮走，可謂沾光不淺。</p>
<p>執行小組的房上掛上美國旗以後，實奎士就拿望遠鏡那到屋頂觀虞。攻城部隊的許多英勇表現，都是這倍盟國軍官親自看在眼裏。「勝利」支隊每打一個據點，前邊都有一班抽旗的奮勇隊，盲美敵人的機槍掃射，硬往共軍的據點跟前猛撲。如同孫司空似的，叫共軍的士兵無法招架。十三日下午我軍還沒有攻入蒙　銀行和警察局，這兩個據點就抽上國旗，有兩個士兵一邊端着機關槍，一邊悠揚的劃　洋火吸烟。後來我們進行調查，站在蒙張銀行屋頂的是「勝利」支隊三大隊的戰友梁超盛，「勁進」縱隊長常面許給他娶一個老婆。然在警察局屋頂的是「勝利」支隊第一大隊第八中除的下士班長高學川，已決定改名賽軍魏，做爲各部隊的模範。</p>
<p>竇奎士中校今年九十多歲，曾參加第一二兩次歐戰，和太平洋人戰，但是沒有見渦國軍的作職英勇。他說：「史達林絳勒是據進爭奪，集寗會戰是家屋爭奪「。這次共軍寗死不肯放棄家屋，國軍不要命的硬把共軍逐出家屋。有幾次他看見國軍抵擋不住，陳勢快要頓挫，可是在緊要關頭，國軍老是轉敗爲勝。所以實奎土中校到共軍退出集寗，看見「勵進」蹤隊長翹起大姆指設：「怪不得魏德選將軍說傳長官的軍隊能打仗，原來　國十二戰區的士兵，眞是頂瓜瓜」。</p>
<p>潰兵變有力部隊</p>
<p>共軍絕不是綿羊似的，被收人的　子一閧競可逃跑，國軍也不是天兵天將眞個能呼風喚雨。因此在這圖集寗會戰的大勝仗中，我們也有不少小小的失敗。例如才一日晚鬨，「黃河」支隊頓挫，「少年」支隊的指擇所遭受惡擊，「勵進」總隊的指揮所也受了影響；傷兵祇看見我門的重幾　槍被共軍抗走，並沒有看見國軍後來用沒拉火的手溜彈，打碎敵人的　袋重新奪回。因此他們就把意些敗蹟宣傳出去，　亂了軍心。尤其伙馬夫一類的雜役兵最雜數握，更把預備部隊的　　　亂。</p>
<p>十二日那大，從駱駝　子被打散的國單，都退到土域十一帶。給養軍和華藥車，佈滿了溝　山　，三三兩倆的敗兵，共有一千多人，都往陶林方向逃跑。各部隊的後方官佐皆失掉統　能力，無法制止前方下來的漬兵向後亂　，當時情況非常惡劣。可巧這時民土保攤工作第二縱隊縱隊長魏純美帶着綏東的還鄕隊來到集寗城郊，人民看見軍隊退下，就毫不客氣的以槍攔住。魏總隊長臨時發表了兩個收容　長，把他們集合起來，經過講話以後，才由還鄕隊引路，重新開上集寗前綫。</p>
<p>這一千多潰兵，如集走到陶林，不知要把後方弄成一個什慶局面。可是經過人民的監督，卻變成了一支生力部隊。他們都是黑夜問們別的脫離部數，國軍的指揮官沒有看見他們失掉連絡，共軍亦床發現他們走開。退出集寗時是零星的人馬，重返集寗時是整齊的除伍。當「國光」支隊從西南增援的當兒，他們也從西北返圃。使敵我雙方都以爲提軍裏邊，除了「國光」支隊，還有另外的支隊。不想這文潰兵，在集寗會戰中給我們的士兵鼓足了無限舅氣，給敵人的神經　上了很大的打擊。</p>

<h3>以做工業家爲榮</h3>
<p>— 編者</p>
<p>中國旣然要走上工業化之路，那末非先有埋頭苦幹的工業家不可。目前做一個工業家，實在並不容易，因爲他要有堅强的毅力，勇往直前的精神，不顧一切困難，始終努力建設。</p>
<p>最近新光內衣廠傅家駿王爲二君到香港廣州短短地躭擱了七天，當地工業界大爲歡迎，各報都用很大的標題，登載他們到港到穗（廣州）的消息，這一點可以說是華甫同胞對於上海工業界的關心，也可以說明做一個工業家是最光榮的。</p>
<p>如果中國的工業家，都以做工業家爲業，努力建設，那末對於工業的進步，當有相當裨益。</p>
<h3>中國紡織工業的問題</h3>
<p>— 鄧紹裘</p>
<p>一件事情，或一種現象的發生，必有其發生的一種癥結存在而要謀補救或推進這種事情或現象的發生，就要先明瞭這種事情或現象發生的原因，也就是要澈底了解其發生的癥結。然後對症下藥，方可尋得適當的補救方法，同樣的，欲謀復興中國的紡織工業，就要澈底了解紡織工業盛衰的因素，與促其發生的癥結，然後由所得的因素與癥結，謀補救的方法。</p>
<p>現在我們先根據過去（見第一段）的中國紡織工業發展過程，可以歸納中國紡織工業盛衰的一些癥結：——</p>
<p>（甲）關於紡織工業本身問題上的。</p>
<p>（一）機械的問題。</p>
<p>（二）設備的問題。</p>
<p>（三）管理的問題。</p>
<p>（四）人選的問題。</p>
<p>（五）資金的問題。</p>
<p>（乙）關於其他問題上的。</p>
<p>（一）國民經濟的情况。</p>
<p>（二）紡織原料之生產與供給的情形。</p>
<p>紡織業競爭的工具是機械，而要想達到競爭勝利的目的，首光就要求機械的優良，然而我國各紡織工廠內所有的機械，大部份是二十年前的，祇有極少數新建的紡織廠，機械比較新穎。此外，即由舊機整理或改造的廠家，亦屬少見。這是我國紡織工廠的最大弱點，試想以陳舊的機械去同擁有新穎機械的外廠相競爭，這怎麽能操上着。</p>
<p>次之，工廠的設備，也可以說是一個良好工廠的先決條件，有良好的設備，才有良好的工作與效能，這差不多是天經地義的定律了，但過去，我國工廠的設備都很簡陋，而且也沒有被人好好的注意過，一切試騐儀器，運輸設備等等，都是因陋就簡，而近幾年來，由於紡織事業的不景氣，於是一切簡陋的設備，不僅談不到改善，而且在更進一步的荒蕪了，因之，所得的結果即生產品不能獲得良好的成績。</p>
<p>工作技術的良好與吾，與人才的優劣，也有着極大相互開係的，但過去各廠，對於一廠的人選問題，向不甚注意，大多數的工作人員，都是由糾戚朋友的關係介紹人廠工作，因之，關於這人的工作技術如何？紡織智識如何？大都忽視，不聞不間，且中國廠家一般普遍的現象是—一廠之中生出各色各樣的派別，於是乎「鉤心鬥角，欺詐狡騙」的頽風，這不僅不能促進工廠自身的前途繁榮，反而促成工廠的早日倒閉，連自存都談不到，又怎能談競爭呢？</p>
<p>資金之於工廠，懷血液於人生一樣地重要，血液不循環，人就不能生存，資金周轉不靈，工廠就難存在，所以要發展一個工廠，就要首先具有充裕的資金，但過去我國的各紡織工廠，對於流動資金準備得太少太少，以致一旦稱遇銷路不暢，或存貨太多的時候，就要停工减縮，損失莫大，然若在銷路極暢的時候，又感到供不應求，這是我國過去一般工廠的普遍現象，而這種「捉襟見肘」的情形，又何能促進工廠本身業務之上鼎邪！</p>
<p>然過去紡織工業的衰落，其主因果由於廠方管理不當，但是國民經濟貧弱，農村凋疲，原料供給不當等，未始不是使紡織事業不能繁榮的原因，的確，過去各廠所感到異常痛苦的就是「銷路停滯」與「原料貴而產品廉」的畸形現象，而要消除這種畸形的現象，祇有使國民經濟安定，農村繁榮起來，同時對於紡織的原料生產與運輸也要有良好的統制，否則，也是絕對消除不了的。</p>
<h3>工廠中顡色的研究</h3>
<p>— 林漢</p>
<p>譯自「科學的美國人」九月號</p>
<p>在生藍的廠家中講究顏色的利用，現在已成爲一種强烈的趨勢。因爲事實上已證明在工業上縝密的選擇顏色，可以改進視的環境，進而令產品增加；此外，它還可以改進風氣，增加安全，以及便利廠務的料理。</p>
<p>實際上，在工廠裏愼用顏色的觀念並不是新的，幾在十年以前，雜誌上便已有刊登，且爲今日所廣泛採用。比方，美國出版的國家安全新聞雜誌在一九三七年曾刊過下列一段話：『在輓近的保養工程中，常利用白色以外的高反射率的顏色，因爲它不但散布光綫，而且可增進僱員的興奮的氣氛。顏色令人歡快，其對於工作人員的作用不亞於富吸引力顏色的商品對顧客的影響，現在由顏色的應用而改進工廠的風氣及僱員良好的意念的成效正在增長中』『有光亮顏色的機器較易保持乾凈。在實用上，現在已漸趨於將機器漆以溫和的大靑色，如此可使工人視覺便易，及减少其眼睛上的應變，甚至在長時間注視機器動作時亦無大礙』。雖然自從此一段話寫下了以後，工業上顏色的應用已有了長足的進步，但它仍能一樣適用於今日，它實際上就代表了工業顏色史的礎石。</p>
<p>增加生產</p>
<p>在工業上利用顏色，首先要考慮的便是增加生產。適當的選用顏色，可以减少墻壁及天花板的閃射，而改良視的環境。機器上的顏色較爲明亮時，可令工作下之光度與環境的光度比較平均，這是維持極限視力所必需的條件。</p>
<p>由長期硏究心理學上的因素的結果，已證明當工作中的光度五倍於環境之光度時，視的能力减至正常的百分之七十七，反過來，如果環境的光度五倍於工作下之光度時，視的能力則减至百分之四十四。當環境與工作下之光度大致一樣時，爲最適當的情形。若顏色選擇適當則此情形即可達到。美國南方有一製造導管裝具的工廠，據有一次研究所得，顯示其中工人之生產量在早上降低的三分一，在下午約降低十分之一，後經將廠中顏色重行粉飾之後，雖工作至上午十一時及下午四時，生產量也未見呈减縮的現象。</p>
<p>改進風氣</p>
<p>幾乎與上述的同樣重要的是顏色的樹立風氣的作用。因爲工廠裏的工人常在工廠中消耗其大部分的時光，所以在其工作的四周應有一合理的，歡快而富吸引力的氛圍。事實證明，僱員的效率常因環境或工作不時的變換而增加，此種變換可用增加工資，改變工作，或調換一新的工塲的形式行之。此外，將墻壁，天花板，機器漆新亦是增進風氣的一個辦法。</p>
<p>清潔與安全</p>
<p>從實用的角度上說，經騐吿訴我們，當機器，墻壁，天花板上漆以富吸引力的顏色時，工人會將此一工廠保持得比較乾凈。因爲工人們對其環境的美觀會感覺得很得意，而將繼續的使它保持下去，這樣，保養的費用不但不增加，而且反被减少了。</p>
<p>顏色對安全的貢獻並不小，據一個工廠統計所得，謂常現代化的顏色工作做好之後，個別的損傷事件减少了百分之四十。祇要在照明方面改進後，顏色會使一個工廠比較安全。西屋的工程師說他們的哲理是使『每一個危險成爲可見的』，常危險的部分以醒目的顏色標明時，常續縫外面以明顯的界綫註明時，當黑暗的地方及走廊以反射性極强的顏色使其明亮時，此一工廠的安全指數將會很顯著的昇高。</p>

<h3>工商管理概論</h3>
<p>— 徐百益</p>
<p>雇員心理</p>
<p>如果我們所做的工作是需要很大的觀察力的，如製造鐘錶，燈泡等，那末我們所需要做的測騐，就要以觀察力爲目標。</p>
<p>這測騐的實行，可以分爲兩種，一種是把固有的職工加以測驗，考査測騐的效果以後，就可以知道他們所需要的是什麽訓練，另外一種測騐，在雇用職工的時候，一定要經過這些測騐。</p>
<p>講到這裏，我們很可以想到中國一般企業在雇用職工的時候，不會有詳盡的測騐工作的，如果是雇用一個辦公室裏的職員，那末至多是要他做一篇中文或英文的文章，在需要用化學或算術的地方，那末出幾個關於化學或算術的考試題目，再加以口試和體格檢査，關於那個人的性格，祇能在口試的時候觀察一些，但那主持考試的人在幾分鐘內怎能够看出一個人的性格來呢，如果是在工廠裏面，那末雇用工人，也不會有嚴格的測騐，有時候由工頭去負責物色相當的工人來擔任工作。</p>
<p>中國人還有一種不良的習氣，是對於企業組織的經營上有極大的阻礙的，那就是雇用私人，或者用推薦的方法，於是一般人都礙於面情，有許多章則，就很難實施，在有許多較大的企業巾，那末都設有人事科（或人事管理委員會）專門主持人事方面的事務，在這種情形之下，在主管常局，就可以免除許多爲難，因爲有熟人推薦職工的時候，就可以通知人事科去辦理，事實上也可以收到較優良的工作效率。</p>
<p>測騐的時候，在心理方面，下列各點，是應該加以硏究的，所做的測騐，也可以以下列各點爲標準，而與所做的事務配合起來，加以增減，（一）誠實，（二）忠心，（三）注意力集中，（四）與同事合作，（五）上進心，（六）創造力，（七）做事透澈，（八）敏捷，。管理的才能，（十）記憶　。</p>
<p>下次將就各點分述。</p>

<p>現在我要說的這位女詩人「斐麗斯魏蘭」（Phillis　Whestley）一無上面的條件資格，但她卻成了英美的一代詩人。這位女詩人的出處，是一個非常的可憐蟲，她生在菲洲的史奈奇（Senegal）地方，一七六一年被黑奴船帶到美國的波土頓城販賣，有一個做裁縫叫「魏蘭」的，把她收買下來，爲他病中的妻子作侍侯。「婓麗斯魏蘭」原名「斐麗斯」，因效被賣在裁縫「魏蘭」家裏，所以在名字上再加「魏蘭」。又因自小被人拐賣，所以她對自己年歲也不清楚，大約是生於一七五三至一七五四年之間。這位女詩人雖然是荒漠地帶的野草開花，她的性情卻溫和馴良，聰明玲俐，並且天真活潑，勤勤懇懇，怪惹人可憐，所以她在裁縫家裏，很受小主人們的喜歡。小孩們根本無賓主貴賤的思想，所以廝混在一起，度着很民主化的生活。</p>
<p>那時「斐麗斯魏蘭」雖然操故下賤的工作，但她嗜好文學的明芽，在無人教導以下，自然地透露起來，當她空閒的時候，常常手拿木炭，在牆壁上東塗西劃的意欲寫字，那時她還一字不識，女主人見了，不但並無責駡，並且驚奇她好學的天才，所以叫她跟從女主人的女兒讀書。如此不滿一年半的光陰，「斐麗斯魏蘭」已能誦讀和瞭解聖經中最困難典奧的句語。</p>
<p>「斐麗斯魏籣」在工餘夜裏，點了燈讀書寫字，秉着伊超特的大才，到八歲時已能寫清順流暢的英文。同時因她個性和善，好像綿羊一樣，所以很多女性朋友與她結成翰墨之緣，時有魚雁住來。她日常的寫作，自幼便不慣呆板大篇的文章，她愛寫小品片段的東西，她的作品，常常富有詩意，芳齡方僅十四歲的時候，已能做出很瑰麗的詩，並且她的作品，竟與英國的大詩人相媲美。她潛心研摩希臘和拉丁的古詩，在她所作弦誦「華盛頓」的一首短詩裏，大有羅馬大詩人「維堪爾」（Virgil）的作風。</p>
<p>「斐麗斯魏蘭」於十九歲時於她獨特的創作，其餘各篇是模銳感性的，各種描寫深刻，緊張，尖銳，細膩，熱烈兼長並勝。她的作頻繁夥，流傳頗廣，在十八世紀中，被稱爲波士頓的桂冠詩人（Poet　laureate　of　Boston）載譽之盛，當可相見。此外她精詣天文，地理，東方歷史及各種經典，故伊當時在學術界的地位，亦是芳名藉藉居於第一流學者之林。有一次，她因爲患病，醫生叫她航行海洋，所以她渡海到倫敦，由於她詩名之盛，所以在倫敦時受到當地市長貴族名流的熱烈招待。當十八世紀時代，歐洲的封建思想，相當濃厚，階級觀念，牢不可破，但「斐麗斯魏蘭」以一菲洲女子奴隸的身世，得到顯貴們的優遇，確是難如登天，詩人的地位，文藝的力量，畢竟非凡！「斐麗斯魏蘭」的丈夫，叫「約翰彼得氏」，（John　Peters）這個人曾經做過理髮匠，雜貨商，同時讀過法律，因爲資質聰明，樣樣都懂，人家連稱他彼得氏博士。他的性情奇懶，一事無成，所以這位女詩人嫁給他，縱非彩鳳隨鴉，至少是一個不幸福與不愉快的結台。她曾生過三個孩子，俱中途夭殤。夫妻相聚的年數不多，約翰彼得氏就死。「斐麗斯魏蘭」在乖惡的命運悲愴的情緒中，亦短促了生存的壽命，在一七八四年十二月五日香消玉殞，年約三十一歲。</p>
<p>綜觀「斐麗斯魏籣」的一生，她從未受過正式教育，但成就了熌爍古今的大詩人，一半固由於天賦獨厚，一半則由自己的苦學，美國女青年會爲紀念這位偉大的女詩人，最近曾撰文予以讚揚。筆者譯伊小傳，是自勉並勉失學肯年的微意！</p>
<h3>行雲流水</h3>
<p>— 許士騏</p>
<p>國畫上的造境，見空靈排宕，抒寫幽情；與實現人生的境界，有相當距離，作家對自然空間色相，是神合貌離；而具有他個人的風格和意境。漸江·石濤·瞿山三大家，同寫黃山，各狀雄奇幽邃之境，各寫行雲流水之觀，瞿山造松，如高人隱逸，傲岸不羣，石濤潑墨，尺幅煙雲，氣象萬千，漸江寫作，清奇冷雋，若蘭生空谷，摒絕鉛華，一塵不染。</p>
<p>近觀賀天健先生所作山水．師造物面別具會心，雄惲樸穆，獨往獨來，矯近代江南作家平庸泥古之風，不爲物囿，崇其所尚；而能發揮性靈。其鉅製「河山還投圖」，「關山圖」，及「黃山深處」等傑作，匠心獨運，偉麗精工。他富於幻想，具有詩人襟轆，借筆墨以寫其抑鬱，愈窮則愈工，（作窮搜博採解）而非窮而後工者。</p>
<p>「胸中有此境，不必世上有此境也，筆下有此境，不必古人有此境也。」他對藝術創作的態度，可憑此寥寥數語，得其梗槪。「危崖飛瀑」，「關山暮煙」，「惠山石門秋曉」，計二百餘件，心如大壑藏無足，萬百幽奇放意搜；此亦胸頭峯谷也，人將疑是劍門秋」。這是他的題句，十年精作，萃於一堂，我個人心賞，一吐爲快，用告精神枯竭，藝壇荒蕪今日上海的知音。</p>
<h3>蠢事備忘錄</h3>
<p>— 卡尼基作　史霄雲譯</p>
<p>「世上有三種最堅硬的東西：鋼，金鋼石和瞭解自己。」</p>
<p>（本文作者Dale　carnegie是當代美國名處世修養專家，他的文章生動流暢，深爲大眾喜愛。他的著作有不少已譯成中文。本文原制於Your　Life雜誌十月號，作者這種的修養方法很值得我們效仿）。</p>
<p>在我私人的文件包中總珍藏着一本小冊子：蠢事備忘錄。這裏記錄着不少自己所幹的蠢，事一月一月地過去，我從不曾間斷或停頓。有時我囑咐自己的秘書代記，可是有些事情實在太愚蠢了，我深怕他會笑我，所以普通都是自己抄寫的。</p>
<p>十五年前我就置備了「蠢事備忘錄」，在這悠長的歲月中，要是我能完全坦白忠實地記錄自己的蠢事，那麼如今的文件包一定早漲破了。——確如黑伯得說的，「每一個人一天中至少要做五分鐘的蠢虫，智慧在那時根本失其所用」。</p>
<p>每次當我重讀這些記錄時，我總會得到極大的啓示和援助，它的價值遠在蘇羅門王任何嘉言之上。他幫我解決了一個最大的難題：自我控制法。</p>
<p>一九四四年七月卅一月有一名人在紐約的一個藥行中逝世。他名叫霍華爾，他的死訊震動了整個市場，因爲他是一個美國財政界的首領。</p>
<p>我對他很熟悉．從前他是我處世演說班中的一份子。他不曾受過正式教育，他的生涯是以一個鄉村店鋪中的小職員開始，略後他在卡內惎鋼鐵公司中作晚工，但廿二年以後，他是美國鋼鐵公司（這是世界最大的鋼鐵公司，由卡內惎公司改組而成—譯者）的經理，他已有地位及權力。</p>
<p>有一夜，他在我們演說班中講演，在他的話語中他透露了一個他成功的原因。</p>
<p>「許多年米，我總保存着一本記載我日常所作所爲的備忘錄，星期六的晚上自我檢討的時間，在這時間中我重溫那過去一週的工作」。</p>
<p>「晚餐後，我孤獨地離開了餐室，翻開備忘錄，追憶一週間的會晤，討論和集會，我捫心自問：我曾做錯了什麼事情？我又幹了些什麼有價值的事？——我有什麼方法能使自己有更大的成就」？</p>
<p>「有時這一個回憶深深地使我感到不快。有時竟會對自己所幹的蠢事驚愕。當然，一年年地過去，這種蠢事漸漸地減少，如今我對自己的進步也感到相當滿意。這一種自我檢討的方法真使自己受惠無窮」。</p>
<p>霍華爾這種方法大槪是從寫蘭克林處學到的，所不伺的只是富蘭克林每夜便來一下檢討而不一定是在週末。他發現自己有十三個嚴重的缺點，其中三個是：浪費時間。吹毛求疵。喜與人爭論。</p>
<p>他很知道，要是自己不把這些缺陷除去他決不會有更大的成就。所以每一周開始時他便選擇其中一個缺點來作一星期的戰鬥，下一週，他又與另一缺點挑戰，到星期日鐘聲嚮時，他已克服了對手。</p>
<p>這樣的戰鬥，富蘭克林繼續了二年之久，怪不得他會成功爲人敬愛的一代偉人。但他曾寫：「世上有三種最堅硬最困難的東西：鋼，金鋼石和瞭解自己」。</p>
<p>假使有人罵你是「蠢貨」—你將怎樣？憤怒？對駡？還是相打？這裏有一段林肯的故事。</p>
<p>斯坦頓是林肯的參謀長，有一次他氣忿地駡林肯爲實足的「蠶貨」，因爲總統爲了取悅一個自私的政治家所以在一張撤兵條約上簽了名。這是一個嚴重的錯誤，斯坦頓拒絕了那個命令。</p>
<p>當林肯知道了這事後，他卻很平和地說：「假使斯坦頓真的駡我是蠢貨，那我一定是蠢貨了，他說的話從沒有錯誤。讓我再檢討一下」。</p>
<p>林肯去見期坦頓，他被斯坦頓說服了，所以便把那命令取消。林肯對嚴重而出於至誠的評論總表示非常的歡迎。</p>
<p>我們也應談歡迎這類的指摘，因爲我們寶在不能担保自己所幹的有四分之三是對的。故羅斯福總統在白宮中曾說過這樣的話，而愛因斯坦還不敢有這樣的企望。他說在他一百個結論中往往有九十九個是錯誤的！我們對自己的蠢事有什麼可恥而值得隱蔽而不改正呢？</p>

<p>硤石之憶</p>
<p>假如沒有聽到車中乘客相互談着這就是「硤石」了的話，我疑心眼前決不是舊地曾遊的硤石鎮。不過接着我望見了一個山峯，峯頂上一個塔，同周圍地帶一樣，景象非常地凄寥，想起十幾年以前，我從杭州到上海途中，在這裏下車去看過先兄的．本來硤石在輿圖上沒有什麼地位，而且同名的有四處，黃河津濟處石路阻峽，稱硤石，淮水北逕山峽中，謂之硤石，河南的硤石關，而這裏，非河非淮，只有錢江支流的聚匯，也許同似水峽的形態，又是杭城的首鎮，便成了商旅的輻輳點。所以浙江省第二區營業稅局設在硤石，是先兄的舊任地，那時，水叉口的帆檣，確乎很多，先兄陪我整整玩了一晚，又爬上山峯，聽遠遠傳來的鐘聲，神往者久。現在，十幾年後的重過，硤石是那麼凄寥得使我不認識了，衰草，頹垣，看不見一支帆影，我們浙江的首鎮在那兒？當然不過一年的工夫，是不容易復原的，何況愈是工商角逐的地方，更深的遭受過敵人摧殘，而距我先兄之死也很多年了。遵從吳季札的話：「骨肉復歸於土，命也，至魂氣則無不之也，」先兄就在戎馬倉皇中而死，倉皇中埋骨異鄕，「橫胸塊壘難呼酒，遮眼山河暫息機。」我記得這樣唱了悼詩後，心境變得更沉鬱，看着舊遊的山峯，不知其名，不知是否叫沈山？（據沈山在海寗東北宋沈景葬此）</p>

<h3>一寸山河一寸血　89</h3>
<p>— 葉勁風</p>
<p>又既是捨着性命，冒險走了這一遭，不留下一個紀念，也太不合算。如今回到原來題目上，虎弟是想除掉那個通縣偽自治區的禍根殷逆。這一點，假使沒有幹掉那個佐佐木源，儘有充分時間，也未嘗不可試試。現在就連搜尋他藏身的所在，也難辦到。這個目標，只可暫時放棄。</p>
<p>像這樣巨大的軍事設備，當然藏有巨量軍火，如是能夠找到，倒也不難燬掉他一些；但剛才發現了那個發電室的當口，我就悟到這裏地下室，不在少處，並且必是大規模的建築，然而一時三刻，從那裏入手探索呢？這一條計劃，也祇好放棄，再有一條，就是放一把火，把這大建築給他燒掉一二問，也未嘗不可以警戒這趾高氣揚的倭軍一番，但像這己經見過的這些建築，沒有一間不是水泥鋼骨的材料所造，我們拿什麼區燒燬？這也是一個空想。</p>
<p>倒是這堆汽油桶，單怕是用過的空桶，否則倒有一篇文章可做，想對這裏，便對虎弟說明，先去查看那些圓桶，我們照以前樣子，一前一後探索前進；九分鐘裏，就達到了目的地。一眼可以見到這是一個汽油總站，這裏除掉堆集如山的油桶之外，還有許多加油的氣壓唧筒裝置，朝北一排下去，看不清楚，估計至少也有差不多二三十個，試敲了敲那些油桶，倒是實實滿滿裝着有油。</p>
<p>再檢查了一下地面，卻是水泥鋪着；不用說，定是很堅固的地下油池。短時間內，又無器具，無法動牠。油桶後面，隔開五六丈遠，堆着一堵煤嶺，朝北拖長下去，竟不知有多少長。我們到了這煤堆的腳根，朝堆頂一測量，佔計至少也有四五丈高，尚幸煤堆的坡度不十分陡，並且都是大煤塊壘壘起來，很容易爬土去。我叫虎弟先土堆頂去，看看形勢；因我們想在這裏下手工作，得先把當地情形弄明白，一有驚動，就可趨避。我很希望這裏也同東邊一樣，有大路，有叢林，石墻，以及牆外還有小溪等等。</p>
<p>虎弟一聽叫他上煤堆觀察，只輕輕答應一聲，像猿猴一般，手腳並用，幾下就到了堆頂，伏在那裏。我正在估量這些汽油桶，應當用什麼方法破壞，忽然聽得一聲微噓，虎弟發了警報。我一伏身，朝虎弟伏的地方看去，見虎弟正向我招手，叫我土去。</p>
<p>這一帶煤嶺，真的僅僅堆着煤塊嗎？那才大大不然咧。我一路上着之煤堆斜坡，就覺這些煤塊，堆得過分整齊，不免可疑。剛到頂上，虎弟就打着手式，指着西邊的斜坡下，悄沒聲地說，「瞧！……」這裏可說一片漆黑，天空雲頭極低，堆上全是煤塊，叫我瞧什麼？但虎弟一雙夜貓眼睛，必有所見。</p>
<p>虎弟這時，早已順着西邊煤坡下去，我於是也跟着他的路綫走着，剛剛下到三分之二所在，徒然發現腳側的堆子，凹進一道寬槽，逼着眼光，仔細一看，漸漸辨明出來，這槽裏竟是整整齊齊的一座砲位，砲身一大半埋在煤堆裏，砲口卻向西指着，偏向西南一點。這西南一點，不正是北平一帶嗎？</p>

<h3>昏燈碎語</h3>
<p>— 少夫</p>
<p>在外國人手下做事的中國人，包括洋行，電車公司，普通商店等等，大抵都有點憎惡他們的上司的；這種憎惡感在罷工時更充分發爲愛國之忱，給旁人看了頗受感動。但是當你在搭乘電軍時，繳水電費時，到外商店裏購物時，他們又是一副「準洋人」面孔，連呼：「中國人總是攪七念三，眞討厭！」</p>
<p>在一片加捐，加稅，加價以及市場不景氣聲中，當局一再關謠說：「發行孫票絕無其事，想係一部份商人敏感縣揣所致，從這裏面我們可以看出商人們在絕望當中的一種希望；但是近經濟情形的發展，商界巨子發表談話如儀之後，都大搖其頭證：「我們是一點希望都沒有了！」</p>
<p>這兩天高檢處正在偵訓「偽華影」附逆影人，但是報戰「偽華影」老板張善琨還在香港做寓公，主持幾家民營影片公司，並且一度派人到滬平等地邀角；據說他所以能這樣優哉游哉，完全由於「某巨公」的保繹。巨公既能加惠孑遺、何妨索性把那些楚楚多姿的「明星」們也援例保釋一番，讓他們老板夥計再度合作，歌舞升平，「春江」無復「遣恨」，巨公「萬世流芳」！</p>
<p>上海這幾月來很有朝氣：從熱烈選舉土海小姐開始，接着痛悼熊貓病故，反對太陽旗商輪進口，菊花展覽會開幕，一直到最近都市計劃委員會議決宣佈上海將成世界第一大都市爲止，我們的心裏充滿了光明與興奮。但現在走到馬路上，還多的是千瘡百孔，垃圾邊地；不過憧憬於「上海即將成爲第一大都市「的美麗時，我們又好像變得很健忘的了！</p>
<h3>拜耳商標　與張天師「靈符」</h3>
<p>— 馬默</p>
<p>勝利後在接收敵　物資之中，除了本來屬於日僑日軍的以外，屬德國商人的物資如「德孚」的顏料染料，「拜耳」的西藥，等等，怕可以烈作第二　最大的數字了吧。然而既屬存貨，所以不管怎麼多，終有賣完的一天。經過一年來不斷標賣「拜耳」藥品，最近報上說：當局眼看着存貨快完，而正在考慮「拜耳」商標權使用這問題上來了。初時說留給政府或官營機構用，近來又說在考慮讓給民間。不過問題並非在乎誰來使用，却在如何使用與應否使用。</p>
<p>「拜耳」商標在中國有堅強信用和廣泛市場是事實，甚至說，百年來在華的西藥商無出其右，也不爲過。然而，商標不過是記號，「拜耳」商標在過去不過是它精良，新鮮，可靠的技術，原料，與乎設備的標記。「拜耳」並非用它商標像張天師之用一道靈符去治人疾病。</p>
<p>況且在今天，德國「拜耳」原有的研究技術人員。早已被美英，蘇三國分別羅致在滬的「拜耳」原料用光了，今從休想再由德國輸入，而原有的裝配設備舊了壞了也只能就地補充。總而言之，在中國的「拜耳」和在德國解體了的「拜耳」，今後很難扣得上聯緊了。</p>
<p>那末，所謂「商標使用權」還不僅僅是「BAYER」這五個字母？</p>
<p>我想：比方「拜耳」假如有特殊方法製造「阿斯匹林，」那末，政府「惠而不費」地把它公開授與中國新藥工業，豈不很好麼？又假如，（事實上不是「假如」了）中國已經能夠自製一樣好的「阿斯匹林」了，那又爲什麼一定把中國貨而冒上拜耳商標推出市塲？難道中國經理在中國鈔票上用洋文簽字就可以增加「信用」麼？不要忘記啊：「沒有科學就沒有國防」，而在這原則下，分明包括這一條：「沒有製藥工業就沒有國防，「阿斯匹林」打起仗來當然是軍需的一項！獎勵中國人去製造呢？還是利用外國的商標來堅抑中國製藥工業的苗芽呢？</p>
<p>問題不祇包括中國醫藥工業之建立，而且包括了中國人自信心自尊心的建立！</p>
<p>糧政在贛省</p>
<h3>從政不如從糧</h3>
<p>— 嘯天</p>
<p>「從政不如從糧」，這句話，在抗戰時，最盛行於大後方的民聞諺語，想不到在今日的江西，也盛行着「從政不如從糧」的笑話，這倒是我國的希奇的怪現象。</p>
<p>自從江西省田糧處長程懋型自殺後，接着於上月廿九日又有着贛省儲運處新喻蓮職站長鄒炳楠投樟河自殺的案件發生（新開報七日），緣因鄒站長貪污虧欠了四萬餘担的餘糧，因無力償還這一筆龐大的數字（按四萬担糧照時價折算當在七萬萬元以上）而政府的清糧官又催之勿停，因而一死了之，以償還其欠糧，以一個小小的站長，能吞蝕四萬餘担的餘糧，亦可見江西的糧政了。我不禁爲救國的政治浩歎！</p>
<p>本來江西經過六年的剿匪與八年的抗戰的洗禮，早經民窮財盡，精竭髓枯了，雖然，國府也曾命令今年的田賦，一槪豁免，這當然是應該感謝他的慈悲心腸，然而，那變相的徵糧，軍糧，俘糧，並未免去人民的痛苦，它似尖刃樣的，正針對着將斃的民衆，而貪污者上下其手，盜賣案層出不窮，那所謂儲糧站長，倉庫主任，莫不腰纏萬貫，以人民的辛苦血汗，作爲花天酒地，荒淫享樂之資，於是乎，從政不如從糧，從糧不如當娼的笑話，也就問世了。</p>
<p>生活隨筆</p>
<h3>金錢以外</h3>
<p>— 李葆眞</p>
<p>在北京路江西路等無軌電車沒等着，於是招呼一輛三輪車。講明到曹家渡來回，五千元法幣。恰巧此時，另一名擠不上電車的少女也要到戈登路去。我因爲已包車來回，便請她同軍。但車夫除五千元外再要額外的兩千元。那位姑娘當然不肯，雙方便破口大罵起來，結果她跳下軍子，只讓我一個人前去。對於這位車夫的脾氣，我不免有幾分担心。走了不久，後面的一位包車夫又不慎將他的車篷搗破，他下車先看了一下，上車開了一程，終於再下車，拉着那位車夫，把他大罵了一頓，最後經路人勸解方罷。我對於他的脾氣，更覺寒心。</p>
<p>在曹家渡等了相當的時間，又在宏仁醫院候了一大會兒。最後他向我提出增加兩千元的要求，我立即允加一千。隨又問他長短。據說，他租車每班八小時要四千元租費，買車要一百五十萬，買不起。訴說他的苦況時，他的面孔和善了，眼光輕柔了，似乎我在他眼目中的價值也有了改變。因爲中飯時間已到，我呌他拉到大中華飯店，照數給他六千元，又建議說：「我現在上樓去吃飯，廿分鐘後就下來。你不是說沒吃過飯嗎？你也去吃。吃完了你再拉我到外灘去好嗎？——不過，你有好生意的話，儘管拉去，不必等我」。</p>
<p>使我又驚又喜的是，他眞的坐在那兒等我。而且似乎是很高興的拉起我就跑。到了外灘，又在交通銀行等了十分鍾然後才拉我到英國怡和大樓。我念了一千元給地，他響也沒響一聲就收下了。</p>
<p>我以爲我知道他態度改變的原因。破口大罵的時候，是他掙扎求生存的表現。他要命，他要生活，因此他也要錢——無所不用其極。一旦當他知道，世界上還有超出金錢以外的東西——一點同情，一點眞誠，一點禮貌，和一點仁愛——他由原野時代進入了文化時代。自衛的本能，用不着了，替而代之的是和順，甚至於是工作的喜樂了。可懈的同胞們，我多麼希望擁有天下的財實，使你們每個人都不用受否，我又多麼希望，你們每一個人都能生活在無私的博愛中！</p>
<h3>神話</h3>
<p>— 錢蕃甫</p>
<p>近來看新聞，恍如讀神話。</p>
<p>神話譏生在廣州：發現時是「金質磚」，化驗時變了「銅磚」，最近公開標賣，改名「金磚」。</p>
<p>以前，我替官史担憂：宦海風波險，人事變化多，職位朝不保夕，飯碗夕不保朝。</p>
<p>今日，我似乎應爲他們慶賀：原來他們都是最懂得做買賣的商人。</p>
<p>上台是官，威風不可一世；下台做買，財產足敷一世。</p>
<p>「官」與「賈」；「官僚」與「資本」看樣子是難解難分了！嘻，哈！</p>
<h3>再談職業保險</h3>
<p>— 季水</p>
<p>在半月以前，我寫了一篇「保障薪水階級，提倡職業保險」的小文，原以爲只是針光上的一滴水，滴在文章的流裏，不會有什麼「反響」的，却不料一位功成而將退伍的軍官陳松耀先生，竟給我一封充滿光與熱的信，他願意和我共同負起鼓吹的責任，我也樂和他實幹。</p>
<p>現在我把我想的辦法，先告訴大家，如有不能付諸實行的地方，務請來函指正爲幸！</p>
<p>一，徵求有「人人爲我，我爲人人」的精神的朋友，至少三十人，愈多則愈善，大家聯絡起來，盡應盡的義務，享應享的權利。</p>
<p>而，贊成的朋友，按月都得出所入百分之一或二或三·四，看收入多少爲定。</p>
<p>三，選舉二位辦事而不拿薪的朋友，一位負責司金錢出納，一位負責介紹職業的朋友，無非是負連絡，轉托工作。</p>
<p>志同道合的薪水階級的朋友們，盍興乎來！</p>
<p>常識測驗</p>
<h3>化粧台上的秘密　燙髮·香水·雪花膏</h3>
<p>— 丁一厂</p>
<p>「自由談」上發表過兩次常識測騐了。那都是比夠新鮮的「硬性」問題。今回換個方向，猜猜女人粧台上的「秘密」吧。不過依然是由科學的觀點米命題徵答，並非「窺粧」或「偷看畫眉」那一類風流韻事，我希望每個讀者能答中六題以上。</p>
<p>（一）頭髮燙得曲曲灣灣，蓬蓬鬆鬆，除了那新式的所謂「冷燙法」是用化學藥物使頭髮受化學變化而變曲外，普通之用炭火或電熱來燙變的，是：</p>
<p>A利用熱力先使頭髮作物理變化；</p>
<p>B利用電磁波使頭髮不伸直；</p>
<p>C利用油類的蒸發使頭髮不復回原狀。</p>
<p>（二）擦在頭髮上香噴噴的油脂狀「髮臘」，它的主要成分是：</p>
<p>A從鑛物油中提煉出來的「凡士林」；</p>
<p>B甘油；</p>
<p>C黏性極大的臘類。</p>
<p>（三）許多講究化裝的小姐，最接觸皮膚的一層化裝品是液體的「化裝水」，無論乳白或肉色的吧，它的主要成分不外乎甘油，因爲甘油：</p>
<p>A可以刺激皮膚的分泌，更加細嫩；</p>
<p>B可以漂白皮膚細胞中色素；</p>
<p>C它不能蒸發，故皮膚常常滋潤。</p>
<p>（四）那來，請間冷天裏人人都愛用的「冷霜」「雪花膏」或「面霜」一類化裝品的主要成分是什麼呢？它是：</p>
<p>A雪白的鉛粉；</p>
<p>B硬脂酸；</p>
<p>C凡士林。</p>
<p>（五）撲在面孔上的香粉，劣質的不用說，較好的面粉主要原料，在下列三種中以那種比較理想呢？</p>
<p>A鉛類的白色化合物；</p>
<p>B鋅類的白色化合物；</p>
<p>C澱粉或鈣類的白色化合物。</p>
<p>（六）灣彎曲曲描在「心之窗」生頭的「眉筆」，看樣子和普通鉛筆相同，但實際上，它却更近似於：</p>
<p>A寫字間所用的「拷貝錯筆」；</p>
<p>B小學生寫書用的臘筆；</p>
<p>C印刷鈔票用的最高貴的黑色油墨。</p>
<p>（七）好好的一根固體的「唇膏」，怎能愜愜意的塗抹在嘴唇上，隨心所欲呢？因爲：</p>
<p>A它含有特妹的「溶劑」足以溶解紅色巴素；</p>
<p>B塗抹時與漆匠之塗漆，並無分別；</p>
<p>C嘴唇皮膚的溫度，足以軟化它所含有的油脂成分。</p>
<p>（八）好些最高貴最漂亮的化裝品廣告上說：「我們的出品含有「荷爾蒙」素」即「內分泌」物，它能由皮膚吸收，刺激皮膚，使你永無衰老之感。這些話從科學觀點來看。完全是：</p>

The personnel for the conference security office have also been announced. The director is Zhang Zhen, and the deputy directors are Han Wenhuan, Wan Jianfan, and Wei Chiping.

<p>Hong Lanyou Reports to Reporters on the Preparations for the National Assembly</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 10th] The National Assembly Preparatory Committee held a press conference on the second floor of the assembly hall at 3:00 PM on the 10th, presided over by Hong Lanyou. Hong first reported on the preparations, (1) The National Assembly was decided in the 24th year of the Republic of China (1935) to be held on November 12th of the 25th year (1936), but it could not be realized. Up to now, the postponement has reached six times on paper, and the preparations have reached five times in fact. (2) The powers of the National Assembly were passed by the Legislative Yuan in the 25th year of the Republic of China (1936). It is to create a constitution, not to implement a constitution. This year's resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference determined that it was to create a constitution. (3) The election affairs were largely completed in the 25th year of the Republic of China (1936), and then the Sixth Plenary Session of the Fifth Central Committee decided to establish the National Assembly Preparatory Committee in the 28th year of the Republic of China (1939). (4) The assembly hall began to be built in the 25th year of the Republic of China (1936), and then rebuilt at Fuxingguan in Chongqing in the 28th year of the Republic of China (1939), and then changed to the Nanquan Central Political School. After the restoration, it was still built on the current site, that is, the site that was hurriedly sought in the 24th year of the Republic of China (1935). The place was originally the place where people were preparing to run the Cultural Theater, so it is not applicable. The capacity is at most 2,500 people. (5) Because the reporter seats are smaller due to the smaller site, there is no way to place more seats, so 120 are fixed, or 60 to 100 more have not been determined. (6) There are five residences for representatives in total, and some areas are reserved for representatives from various parties to participate. There are currently 60 large vehicles, which can barely be used for transportation. (7) The Preparatory Committee decided that the National Assembly will end on the opening day, and the conference is scheduled to be held on the 12th. (8) The preparation expenses are roughly as follows: construction and equipment costs are 1.3 billion, and travel and accommodation costs are 2.8 billion. (9) The seating arrangement in the venue has not been finalized. It is possible that each party will occupy one side, and regional representatives and professional representatives will be arranged in a mixed manner. In addition to the upstairs boxes, the reporter seats are partly located downstairs along the wall.</p>

<h3>The Chinese Communist Party Insists that the National Assembly Must Be Cancelled</h3>
<p>Spokesperson of the CCP in Nanjing Speaks</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 10th] The spokesperson of the Communist Party delegation stated on the evening of the 10th that the Communist Party believes that the upcoming National Assembly must be cancelled in order to conduct negotiations.

When asked by reporters whether the government has decided to convene the meeting as scheduled, will the situation be decided within one or two days? The spokesperson said: "Yes," the convening of the National Assembly will make the situation unmanageable. As for the so-called withdrawal issue, it is very simple. If we cannot talk anymore, there is nothing to do in Nanjing. When asked by reporters about the ceasefire issue, the spokesperson said that since we did not receive prior notice, we believe that it cannot achieve practical results.</p>
<h3>Yan'an Issues a Statement Opposing the Convening of the National Assembly</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 10th] According to Yan'an Radio on the 9th, Liao Chengzhi, the spokesperson of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), issued a statement.

At the same time, he announced another so-called ceasefire order. This ceasefire order, like all previous ones, is not a ceasefire order, but an order to continue fighting." He continued, if Mr. Chiang wants to prove that he has sincerity for peace, then he should: (1) Order the cancellation of the so-called National Assembly monopolized by one party and convene a democratic National Assembly on the basis of consultations among all parties in accordance with the content and procedures of the Political Consultative Conference. (2) Withdraw the troops that have invaded the liberated areas, stop mobilizing troops, and restore the position of the first ceasefire order in January. The Communist Party declares that we are willing to participate in any negotiations for the purpose of true peace, and we oppose all acts of deception.</p>

Now that the military period is over, the great cause of nation-building is about to begin. It is a very valuable opportunity for everyone to leave military life and participate in the work of nation-building. I hope that everyone will recognize the sacredness of the mission they bear in the future and engage in the political, economic, and social construction at the grassroots level with the determination and effort of the past Northern Expedition and War of Resistance to lay the foundation for a modern country, and then we can complete our mission of the National Revolution.

<p>General Chen Cheng, the Deputy Corps Commander, gave instructions, pointing out that the first revolution was to strive for the realization of nationalism, and in the future, we must complete the realization of democracy and people's livelihood.

In the afternoon, the convention successfully passed nearly 200 proposals from the various groups. The representatives are scheduled to meet with the Chairman on the morning of the 11th, and in the afternoon, they can [space].</p>
<p>Demand for Swift Allocation of Emergency Loans</p>
<p>The representatives spoke enthusiastically about requesting the government to quickly allocate "Industrial Emergency Loans" to promote production and construction. They generally believed that since the national banks failed to provide low-interest loans to industry after the war, they had to resort to high-interest loans from the black market, resulting in interest accounting for as much as 40% of costs. Furthermore, real estate could not be used as collateral, leading to the exhaustion of working capital. In addition, due to poor transportation and sluggish sales of similar products, they had to bear huge expenses, resulting in financial difficulties and a sense of helplessness. They hoped that the convention would request the government to order national banks to swiftly implement emergency industrial loans and allow real estate as collateral.</p>
<p>Import Tariffs Should Be Adjusted</p>
<p>Another important proposal was that the current import tariffs fail to protect nascent industries. They requested that the government consider the country's manufacturing capabilities and supply situation and adjust the tariffs to reclaim benefits. The measures are: tariffs should be increased on luxury goods and foreign goods that the country can produce itself; tariffs on finished products should be increased, while tariffs on semi-finished products or components should be reduced or exempted; import of agricultural, industrial, and mining machinery and ships, vehicles, and transportation equipment not for resale should be exempted; and instruments, medicines, and small experimental machines required by educational and research institutions should be exempted.</p>
<p>Government Exchange Rate for Equipment Orders</p>
<p>The most valued proposal in terms of economic construction was: When the industrial sector orders equipment from abroad for development needs, the government should approve foreign exchange at the official rate based on the contract to facilitate cost accounting and project implementation. The measures are: Please allow various industries to [space] apply for foreign exchange for contracts ordered from abroad and settle the accounts at the official exchange rate at any time, without time limit.</p>
<p>Light Industries Transferred to Private Sector</p>
<p>Another important proposal was to request the government to transfer or entrust the light industries it operates to the private sector ahead of schedule. The measures are: (1) Request the government to transfer companies such as China Textile and China Silk, as well as those currently planned, to the private sector, absorbing floating capital and channeling it into industry; (2) Distribute or lease the light industries taken over from the enemy and puppets to the private sector as much as possible to lay the foundation for industry.</p>
<p>Donations and Taxes Also a Focus of Discussion</p>
<p>The representatives generally advocated for improvements to business tax, income tax, and stamp tax, and requested the government to simplify collection methods.</p>
<p>Private Factories Form Compensation Committee</p>
<p>The most important proposal from the compensation group was that the General Association of Industry take the initiative to organize a wartime private factory compensation committee, verify and liquidate the findings according to the investigations, and request the government to convey them to MacArthur and Paul Reynaud, the person in charge of the Far East Compensation Committee, to strongly urge Japan to pay compensation.</p>
<h3>Xi'an Grain Prices Soar; Black Market Rice Exceeds 70,000 Yuan Per Dan</h3>
<p>[Our Xi'an Office, 10th] Grain prices in Xi'an have soared in recent days, with limited effectiveness of price controls. Black market rice exceeds 70,000 yuan per dan, and flour is 33,000 yuan per bag, doubling the price at the beginning of October. The Provincial Land and Grain Office is urgently shipping 100,000 bags to try to stabilize prices.</p>
<h3>Guangxi Province's Budget Insufficient; Executive Yuan Subsidizes in Full</h3>
<p>[Our Guilin Office, 9th] With the revision of the revenue and expenditure system, Guangxi's budget is short by more than 8 billion yuan, which has been fully subsidized by the Executive Yuan.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Bookstore Delegation Completes Mission; Exemption of Business Tax for Bookstores; Methods Still Under Study; Ministry of Education Has Agreed to Forward Request to Ministry of Finance for Approval</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 10th] The Shanghai bookstore representatives, including Li Bojia and 16 others, who came to Beijing to petition, have completed their mission in Beijing and left in batches on the 9th and 10th. Except for one or two people, they will all return to Shanghai. According to Xu Boxin, one of the representatives, to the reporter: During this trip to Beijing, they successively met with the economic, financial, and educational authorities to appeal. They were kindly received by Minister Wang Yun-wu and others. The relevant authorities were extremely concerned about the current difficulties of the bookstore industry and stated that the issue of exempting business tax was not entirely impossible, but the methods still needed to be studied. Textbooks already have tax exemption regulations, and other books may also be exempted by analogy. The Ministry of Education has agreed to this matter and has agreed to forward it to the Ministry of Finance for approval. The financial authorities will also discuss it with its subordinate Direct Taxation Department. After the representatives return to Shanghai, they will consult with the municipal government and its Finance Bureau to enable the Shanghai Municipal Council's resolution to exempt bookstore business tax to be realized. He also stated that in addition to requesting the authorities to exempt business tax, another urgent problem to be solved by the bookstore industry is the difficulty in postal delivery. Currently, the post office has restrictions on the volume of parcels accepted for delivery, and delivery also takes time. Often, one must go to queue as early as 3 a.m., which affects the circulation of books. It is truly a significant issue, and it is hoped that it can be improved.</p>

<h3>Taiwan Representatives Arrive in Suzhou to Investigate Commercial Conditions</h3>
<p>Hope the Government Abolishes the Economic Blockade Policy</p>
<p>[Our Suzhou Office, 10th] Xie Chengyuan, Jiang Weichuan, Huang Zaishou, and Li Ziqi, the four representatives of Taiwan Province to the National Federation of Commerce, arrived in Suzhou via Nanjing on the evening of the 10th. Local business leaders went to the station to [space] welcome them. They stayed at the Lexiang Hotel and plan to go to Shanghai on the 11th after observing the current commercial situation in Suzhou before flying back to Taiwan. Local journalists flocked to interview them and inquired about the commercial economy of Taiwan. The representatives shared their opinions. A summary is as follows: The commercial economy of Taiwan still maintains a special status, with no connection to the mainland. The biggest regret and pain is that there is no normal communication. For example, surplus materials in Taiwan Province such as sugar, rice, coal, salt, and camphor cannot be fully transported and sold to other ports, while lacking materials such as fertilizers and foreign cloth cannot be supplied continuously. Secondly, all factories in the province are shut down under receivership. Those who use production do not reach two-tenths, resulting in an unemployment population of 600,000 to 700,000, with technical personnel being the most numerous, accounting for 12% of the population. It is the most painful issue for the people of Taiwan. The reporter inquired about the current education situation. According to the reply: Education in Taiwan Province was originally very developed, and parents invariably regarded educating their children as the most important obligation. However, today the future of education in Taiwan Province is fraught with two crises: (1) Teachers cannot receive their salaries, and (2) Poor children cannot go to school, which is truly lamentable. The representatives sincerely stated: Today, the six million Taiwan compatriots in the province unanimously hope that the government will abolish the economic blockade policy so that the land can be used to its full potential and goods can flow smoothly. The reporter inquired about the current living standards of the Taiwan compatriots. The representatives said: Cries of cold and hunger can be heard in the streets [space] and they gave an explanation, and so on.</p>
<h3>Yantai Relief Work Progresses Smoothly; Mr. Wang Shiliang Arrives in Shanghai from Yantai to Seek Instructions on Future Work Directions</h3>
<p>[Our City News] General Wang Shiliang, director of the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) office in Yantai, arrived in Shanghai by plane from Yantai the day before yesterday. Yesterday, he told a Central News Agency reporter that UNRRA's relief work in the Communist-controlled areas is progressing quite smoothly, and he will strengthen the strength of UNRRA's relief agencies in the Communist-controlled areas. He also pointed out that the work he conducted in Yantai previously has achieved good results, which can be divided into four points: (1) The work of the UNRRA Yantai office is now proceeding as usual without any obstacles. (2) The staff members who stayed in Yantai in the past are still continuing to carry out relief work in the Communist-controlled areas. The distribution of materials in the Communist-controlled areas is proceeding smoothly and has not encountered any difficulties. (3) The Communist Party has accepted the various points previously suggested to the Communist Party by UNRRA: A. The food and lodging of UNRRA Yantai staff are the responsibility of the Communist Party; B. UNRRA Yantai will set up its own radio station; C. The ratio of "North Sea Currency" to legal tender has been reduced from 16:1 to 8:1. Finally, Mr. Wang stated that his purpose of returning to Shanghai this time is to ask UNRRA for instructions on the future work plan of the Yantai office. Before leaving Yantai, Mr. Wang held meetings with representatives of the Communist Party and UNRRA to discuss various issues related to the progress of relief work in the Communist-controlled areas in the future. The results were good. In addition to reporting the progress to UNRRA, he will also discuss future work directions and strengthen UNRRA's work agencies in the Communist-controlled areas.</p>
<h3>Hualien Port, Taiwan; Coffee Farm; Planning for Reorganization</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Hualien Port, 10th] The Hualien Port Ruishui Coffee Farm is the largest coffee plantation in Taiwan Province. During the Japanese rule of Taiwan, the Wangtian Co., Ltd. was organized to engage in cultivation, with an area of 250 acres and an annual output of 20,000 catties of coffee. During the war, it was unable to take care of it, and it has been abandoned for six years, and now it has become a wasteland. After we took over, the farm was operated by Dongtai Industry Co., Ltd. According to the investigation, 170 acres of the 250-acre coffee farm are completely abandoned and cannot be restored for a while. The remaining 80 acres can still be produced if reorganized quickly. The company has now formulated a five-year plan to restore the old appearance and increase production.</p>
<h3>Contradictions Between France and Vietnam Not Eliminated; Difficult for Our Overseas Chinese to Do Business</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Hanoi, 10th] Although the situation in various parts of Vietnam is said to be good after the implementation of the Franco-Vietnamese New Treaty, all contradictions between France and Vietnam have not been completely eliminated. The overseas Chinese living here are caught between the two major powers and still feel at a loss. Most of the overseas Chinese in Vietnam are engaged in business, and the French and Vietnamese have the most disagreement on issues such as tariffs and transportation. After France implemented the unified foreign exchange settlement method for import and export goods on November 1, the French immediately implemented strict inspections in Haiphong Port. Due to the ambiguity and simplicity of the methods promulgated by the French, the interpretations were different during implementation, and most of the overseas Chinese remained hesitant, resulting in most of the merchant ships entering and leaving Haiphong in recent days being empty. The Vietnamese government then promulgated methods to restrict the transshipment of goods to the interior, making the overseas Chinese in Vietnam who are engaged in business subject to French control over import and export trade and then to Vietnamese restrictions on sales to the interior, causing the commercial activities of overseas Chinese in Vietnam to be stifled. Overseas Chinese in Haiphong have formed a Commission for the Protection of the Rights and Interests of Overseas Chinese to formulate detailed countermeasures and request our authorities and the consulate stationed here to negotiate with both France and Vietnam to protect the rights and interests of the overseas Chinese. The committee will also put forward suggestions on the free trade zone in Haiphong and the Sino-French Commercial Treaty based on the actual situation for the authorities to consult.</p>

<h3>Editorial: Review of the Japanese Reparations Problem</h3>
<p>The Allied Control Council for Japan is scheduled to meet tomorrow to discuss the distribution of Japanese assets and property as reparations to the Allied nations. According to an Agence France-Presse report from London on the 8th, the U.S. State Department has already invited the member states of the Far Eastern Commission to consult with the U.S. government on this issue and hopes that each country will address the following two issues: (1) the immediate distribution of 15% to 20% of Japanese assets as reparations; and (2) the submission of recommendations regarding the final distribution of the remaining 80% to 85% of assets. After approval by the Far Eastern Commission, it will be submitted to the Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers, General MacArthur, for implementation. Therefore, in the past few days, the Japanese reparations problem and how its assets will be distributed have once again become the focus of world attention.</p>
<p>Japan's invasion of China was the fuse of World War II. Later, Japan took the British and Americans by surprise and suddenly attacked Pearl Harbor and Singapore, unveiling the bloody curtain of the Pacific War. Therefore, Japan is the culprit of this war and should bear the same guilt as Nazi Germany, which is beyond doubt. Although the United Nations' demand that Japan pay a huge amount of compensation is not due to a desire for revenge, it ultimately feels that Japan's provocation, which led to a catastrophic disaster, should be severely punished. At the same time, in addition to the role of punishment, there is also the most important role, which is to use this to limit the revival of Japan's war-making capabilities to prevent the resurgence of Japan's aggressive forces and cause a new war in the Far East. This is the unanimous demand of the United Nations for Japan, and there is originally no problem. However, how to calculate the reparations? Because the losses suffered by each country in the war against Japan, whether on the government side or the people's side, are difficult to calculate accurately. At the same time, the losses suffered by each country are also different, and there is really no objective standard. In addition, how much ability does Japan, after its defeat, have to pay compensation? It is also a serious problem. For example, the German reparations problem after World War I has been under discussion for more than 20 years and has not yet found a solution. As another example, the German reparations problem after World War II has not yet been settled. Therefore, today's Japanese reparations problem is not a simple problem. It really has value worth studying.</p>
<p>Among the countries that suffered significant losses during the war against Japan, the four major countries of China, the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union are the first. The opinions of the four countries are completely consistent in demanding compensation from Japan and demanding that Japan use its assets as compensation. There are no other problems. However, the opinions of each country differ on how to distribute them, especially between the United States and the Soviet Union. In view of this, the U.S. and Soviet authorities decided to establish a Far Eastern Commission during the meeting of the foreign ministers of Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union in Moscow in December last year. The commission is composed of 11 countries, including China, Britain, the United States, France, the Soviet Union, the Netherlands, Canada, Australia, India, the Philippines, and New Zealand, and is responsible for "formulating policies, principles, and standards that Japan should strictly abide by when fully fulfilling the terms of surrender." Solving the Japanese reparations problem is, of course, one of the tasks of the Far Eastern Commission. However, the Soviet Union's removal of Japanese industrial equipment from Northeast China and Korea caused friction between the United States and the Soviet Union over the Japanese reparations problem. On the Soviet side, it was believed that the Japanese industrial equipment was the Soviet Union's "spoils of war" and could no longer be regarded as Japanese assets for use as compensation. However, the United States insisted that the Japanese materials removed by the Soviet Union in Northeast China and Korea could not be regarded as "spoils of war" and should still be regarded as Japanese assets, and this batch of materials should be deducted from the compensation obtained by the Soviet Union. At the same time, the United States also sent Truman's reparations commissioner, Paul Reynaud, to Northeast China and Korea to investigate the materials removed by the Soviet Union, and there is already a complete list. In addition, Paul Reynaud wrote to MacArthur in May of this year, advocating that the assets of the Japanese in Northeast China and Korea should remain in place for compensation to those countries. Paul Reynaud's move was clearly aimed at the Soviet Union, so the Soviet Union refused to participate in the Japanese reparations committee, making it difficult for the Far Eastern Commission to start work.</p>
<p>As for our country's compensation from Japan, although it has not yet formally made a request, it has already been decided in principle: that is, "Our country has resisted for the longest time and suffered the most damage. Our country should enjoy a superior proportion and priority in receiving compensation for Japan's compensation to the Allied countries. The government should put forward a complete compensation plan in accordance with this principle, and should also obtain strong participation in the compensation mechanism to be established by the Allied countries in order to realize our country's compensation requirements." When the 21-nation peace conference was held in Paris in September of this year, our Foreign Minister Wang Shijie made a frank statement on the Japanese reparations problem: He said, "Although China suffered heavy losses during the war, it will not make a claim for compensation that exceeds Japan's ability to pay." This enlightened and generous attitude has won the attention and importance of various countries. It is reported that the Chinese government has already written a meticulous plan and will submit it to the Japanese Reparations Committee, the content of which roughly states: China suffered the most serious losses during the war against Japan. From the July 7th Incident to the end of the war, the total loss of public and private materials in China amounted to 4.5 trillion U.S. dollars. This number does not include deaths, injuries, and military expenses. Therefore, China requires that it should receive at least 40% of the total amount of Japan's future compensation to the Allied countries for the purpose of postwar reconstruction. This plan is really the fairest and can definitely win the sympathy and adoption of the countries concerned.</p>
<p>From the above, the solution to the Japanese reparations problem is already imminent and cannot be delayed any longer. Japan, after its defeat, is in a state of rapid development day and night. In less than a year, it has entered the recovery stage from the demobilization period. According to the report of the US delegation investigating Japanese industrial groups, the Japanese financial groups still control huge wealth and economic power, and the industrial group system is so powerful in the domestic economy that it is unmatched by any capitalist industrialized country. Therefore, the continued existence of its potential power is not enough to prevent the revival of Japan's war industry potential. This shocking report makes it all the more necessary to resolve the Japanese reparations problem as soon as possible. According to the speculation of American diplomatic circles, if the Far Eastern Commission's discussion of this issue reaches a deadlock, then this issue will be submitted to the Four Power Foreign Ministers' Conference for discussion, and China will also have to send representatives to participate. From this, it can also be known that the U.S. authorities are also eagerly hoping for the solution to this problem, but looking ahead, there is really no room for optimism. Therefore, we have to shout loudly here and urge the politicians and diplomats of the United States and the Soviet Union to use their great wisdom and ability to achieve a fair and reasonable solution to this problem as soon as possible and lay the most solid foundation for the great plan of peace in the Far East. Do not be shortsighted, selfish, and only see your own interests, and do not know the importance of peace in the Far East, competing with other countries for profits everywhere and risking stagnation, which will only benefit Japan's economic recovery and allow its potential forces to have the possibility of making a comeback. The Allied countries must take precautions against this early on. The U.S. proposal to immediately distribute 15% to 20% of Japanese assets first and then discuss the distribution of the remaining 80% to 85% at a later date is still not enough in our opinion.</p>
<h3>Review of Policies Regarding Studying Abroad</h3>
<p>The results of the Ministry of Education's examinations for government-sponsored and self-funded students studying abroad were recently announced. The general public and those concerned about education have once again discussed the merits and demerits of policies regarding studying abroad. Recently, the spokesperson for the Ministry of Education, in a statement to news reporters, discussed policies regarding studying abroad, stating that during the eight years of war, European and American academia advanced rapidly, and the extent of their progress was beyond what we could imagine. To catch up with the times, we must start on two fronts: on the one hand, we should actively improve the equipment of our universities to seek a fundamental solution, and on the other hand, we should also select talented young people and send them abroad to study. "However, if there are no restrictions, the children of the wealthy can freely go abroad, which will inevitably lead to abuses." The Ministry of Education, considering the major plans for national and ethnic construction, welcomes opinions from society and is willing to consider them humbly. This frank and sincere attitude is worthy of our admiration.</p>
<p>First of all, we feel that it is a pity that we still have to discuss the issue of policies regarding studying abroad. China's dispatch of students to study abroad dates back 70 years. Wu Tingfang, Tang Shaoyi, Zhou Shouchen, Zhan Tianyou, and Yan Fu all studied abroad in this early period. But even now, our country is far from catching up with others in terms of academics, leading to the phenomenon that "European and American academia is advancing rapidly, and the extent of their progress is beyond what we can imagine." This truly makes us feel ashamed. We do not even have the qualifications to imagine their rapid progress. Shouldn't this be concerning? In the 70 years from the initial dispatch of students to Europe and the United States to the present, we have not been without achievements in education and academia, but we still have to discuss policies regarding studying abroad today. Shouldn't this be regrettable?</p>
<p>Studying abroad, in its essence, is a disgrace. It is a sign of a country's backwardness in academic education. When a country's academic education is developed, there should not be a large number of students going abroad to study. Japan and we simultaneously dispatched students to study in Europe and the United States. Later, we had to send students to study in Japan instead. In the 19th century, Americans also considered studying in Europe as an honor, but after American universities and academic education developed, this trend declined. Our current need to send students to study in Europe and the United States indicates that our country's academic education has not yet reached a developed state, which should be a shameful thing. However, the large number of students going abroad to study is a fact. The Ministry of Education manages students going abroad to study with extremely strict restrictions, and they must pass a rigorous examination before they can go abroad. The intention behind this is undoubtedly not questionable; however, the result of this restriction is that those who aspire to go abroad but do not want to take the examination, or those who fail the examination, have to seek other ways, leading to all kinds of abuses. All of this is a fact that cannot be concealed. Therefore, it is not useless for us to review the merits and demerits of our country's policies regarding studying abroad at this time.</p>
<p>Regarding students going abroad to study, we must point out several important points: First, the spokesperson for the Ministry of Education said, "However, if there are no restrictions, the children of the wealthy can freely go abroad, which will inevitably lead to abuses." We do not understand whether the adoption of a policy of controlling studying abroad is to prevent "the children of the wealthy from freely going abroad, in order to avoid abuses." What is the relationship between the children of the wealthy and abuses? Indeed, the children of the wealthy inevitably have some bad habits, but it is not necessarily the case that all those with bad habits are the children of the wealthy. Are there no children of the wealthy who are diligent in their studies? Therefore, the control of studying abroad should not be differentiated based on whether one is wealthy or not. Second, we must also acknowledge the fact that the stricter the control, the more the abuses. The children of the wealthy or those with power can still achieve the goal of studying abroad without taking the examination, by using various pretexts or different methods. As a result, it can be said that it is encouraging the bad habit of making false pretenses and suppressing good, pure-minded, studious young people.</p>
<p>Therefore, we doubt whether the state's policy of controlling studying abroad is a good strategy. At this time, if the state adopts a strict management policy and does not allow students to go abroad freely, while at the same time not actively improving and enriching domestic university education, it is tantamount to undermining the nation's vitality. That is why we feel gratified when we see the statement made by the spokesperson of the Ministry of Education regarding policies regarding studying abroad; because the Ministry of Education also sees the necessity of actively improving the equipment of our universities to seek a fundamental solution; at the same time, it should also select talented young people and send them abroad to study. Here, the problem lies in the selection; are all those who pass the examination truly talented, and are all those who fail the examination incapable of being cultivated? If there are also talents among those who fail the examination who can be cultivated, then there should be a flexible solution within the strictness, so that the declining habit of making false pretenses can be slightly stopped, and true talents will not be abandoned. If handled too extremely, the result of strict control may not necessarily be as ideal as expected. The task of cultivating talents, as the spokesperson of the Ministry of Education said, should be considered from the perspective of the major plans for national and ethnic construction, and should not be based on emotional decisions. When our country's academic education is developed, the system of studying abroad can also be abolished without being banned. For the sake of our country and nation, we hope that it can come soon.</p>

<h3>Commander of Suppression Personally Enters Taihu Lake and Encounters Fierce Battle with Bandits, Capturing Bandit Leader Alive and Seizing Weapons and Ships</h3>
<p>[Our Suzhou Dispatch on the 10th] According to a telephone call from Mudu: Major General Chuan Jinfang, the commander of the Taihu Lake suppression, accompanied by Deputy Commander Liu Hongde, led a company of soldiers on speedboats on the 8th to personally patrol and sweep Taihu Lake. On the morning of the 9th, they encountered a group of scattered bandits on Pingtai Mountain. A fierce battle broke out between the two sides. One of our Disciplinary Corps cadres, Zhao Rengui, was killed in action. Fifteen bandits were captured, one light machine gun, two rifles, and two speed machine guns were seized, and two bandit ships were seized. In addition, a female hostage from Wuxing was rescued. It is reported that the bandit leader Liu Shenlin was originally a former subordinate of Liao Bingnan, who had already surrendered. He independently raised the banner of rebellion, which ultimately led to his capture alive. The Taihu Lake Command has telegraphed the Wuxi Command for instructions on how to handle the case, and it is likely that he will be executed.</p>
<p>[Yixing Dispatch] Scattered bandits are lurking in the southern mountainous area of Yixing, disturbing the local area. Since the establishment of the command headquarters for the suppression area on the border of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces, the mountainous area has been divided into five districts: Zhangzhu, Taihua, Mingling, and Shanjuan, which are suppressed by the 4th Independent Engineer Regiment of the Army. For a month, the remnants of the bandits have been hiding. Recently, in order to thoroughly clear them, the command headquarters has formulated a second phase of suppression measures, which will continue to be carried out by the 4th Engineer Regiment. On the 1st of this month, Wu Zhongxiang, the regimental commander of the regiment and deputy commander of the Qing District on the border of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces, led his troops into the mountains to supervise the suppression, and also mobilized administrative party groups to strictly secure the Baojia system and information network, joint security pledges, etc. After days of advancement, most of the work is about to be completed.</p>
<h3>Anhui Northeast Recovered Area, Politics Has Become Stable, Li Pinxian Meets with Our Newspaper Reporter and Talks</h3>
<p>[Our Hefei Dispatch on the 10th] Governor Li Pinxian of Anhui Province stated during an exclusive interview with our newspaper reporter: (1) The political situation in the recovered area of northeastern Anhui has become stable; because the provincial government had prepared county-level personnel and advanced with the army. (2) In early spring of this year, the dike on the north bank of the Yangtze River was built through government orders, which created a bumper harvest on both banks of the river this autumn. However, the dike construction on the Huai River in northeastern Anhui failed, and the Yellow River was not blocked, so the flooding caused by the Yellow River was even more severe than in previous years. (3) The salaries of public education personnel at the provincial and county levels are meager. Because the number of personnel is fixed, it cannot be reduced. The annual revenue is too small to increase salaries, resulting in serving the public on an empty stomach, just like the hardship in Dabie Mountain in those years. Among them, some township and Baojia personnel above the county level inevitably disturb the people. I hope that examples of oppression of the people will be reported at any time so that they can be improved.</p>
<h3>Zhenjiang-Shanghai Telephone Can Be Connected in One Hour</h3>
<p>Zhenjiang Telecommunications Bureau Improves Business</p>
<p>[Our Zhenjiang Dispatch] After domestic telegraph and telephone rates were increased tenfold compared to the original price this month, our newspaper reporter inquired with the person in charge of the Zhenjiang Bureau to understand the actual situation of the local telegraph and telephone business. It is reported that: (1) For long-distance calls, the Zhenjiang-Shanghai call is the most congested. In the past, there were only two telephone lines, so the waiting time was often more than three or four hours. Recently, three carrier wave lines have been installed between Zhenjiang and Shanghai. Together with the original one, there are a total of four circuits. Now, the Zhenjiang-Shanghai call can be connected within one hour. In addition, the circuit between Zhenjiang and Nantong has also been opened, and one circuit has been added between Zhenjiang and Wujin, with a total of two circuits, which can be called at any time. (2) In terms of telegraphs, the bureau can send telegrams as soon as they arrive, and send and receive them as soon as they are received. Special express telegrams between Zhenjiang and Shanghai, Zhenjiang and Wuxi, and Zhenjiang and Changzhou can arrive within half an hour, and the delivery fee is still 2,000 yuan, and has not been increased. (3) For local calls, the bureau is handling them in accordance with the restrictions. However, due to the increase in the number of local agencies in Zhenjiang, there are recently more than 700 households. Now, in order to promote the connection work, in addition to repairing the machine lines at any time, inspectors are also dispatched to test the phones outside to urge the switchboard operators to pay attention to the connection and repair the user's equipment.</p>

<h3>On the Jinghu Road Train, Grain Merchants Encounter Nian Yang, Going Back and Forth Again and Again</h3>
<p>[Our Suzhou Dispatch] Zhang Shiliang, a grain merchant from Suzhou, originally from Shanghai, met a young man whom he did not know on the train while going to Shanghai a few days ago. He claimed to be a shareholder of Qin Chang Tobacco Shop on Dama Road outside Lumu Gate in Suzhou, named Zhu Songbai. They chatted along the way to relieve boredom and were quite congenial. After arriving in Shanghai, Zhu followed Zhang to a hotel. The next day, he suddenly claimed to have an urgent need and borrowed 50,000 yuan from Zhang. He then followed Zhang back to Suzhou and even went to Zhang's home with him. A few days later, while Zhang was out, he used sweet words to deceive Zhang's wife out of 100,000 yuan, and then disappeared without a trace. Zhang realized that he had been deceived and went to the area outside Lumu Gate to investigate for days. At noon on the 8th, he finally met Zhu on Hengma Road and twisted him into the police station, accusing him of deception. Unexpectedly, after Zhu was twisted into the police station, he suddenly wailed loudly, claiming that he had swallowed a pair of small screws into his stomach and that there was no hope of survival. The police station rushed him to Bu Xiong Hospital for treatment. After Dr. Zhang personally examined him, he found that his complexion was normal and his pulse and heart were beating without any sign of swallowing screws. The police then took him back to the police station. Because he deceived again and again, which was very hateful, he will be severely punished.</p>
<h3>Pinghu Rapeseed Cake Coin Case Transferred to Hebei District Court for Investigation</h3>
<p>[Our Pinghu Dispatch] The long-standing case of corruption in the acceptance of rapeseed cake in this county will be tried in the Hebei District Court on the 21st of this month. When the receiving work inspection team came to Zhejiang to investigate the received materials last month, it was found in the county's receiving rapeseed cake file that there were 9,297 bags and 8,180 dans, with 12,650 linen bags.

The High Court forwarded it to the Jiaxing District Court for handling in accordance with the law. The District Prosecutor's Office has already lost</p>

<h3>Reviving the Tea Gardens in Western Anhui, Proceeding in the Form of Work Relief</h3>
<p>[Our Lu'an Dispatch] The counties in western Anhui suffered a lot during the Anti-Japanese War. Due to the sluggish sales of tea and low prices, tea farmers generally mismanaged the tea gardens, resulting in a year-by-year reduction in tea production. In view of this, the Anhui Branch of the Relief Administration and the Anhui Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry have jointly formulated specific plans and cooperative methods for the purpose of revival and relief. The first phase will temporarily include three counties, Lu'an, Lihuang, and Huoshan, as the implementation area. The work period is temporarily set for three months. The branch office plans to allocate 1,200 tons of flour to subsidize tea farmers in the form of work accounts, and both parties will dispatch 40 technicians to form a working corps to go deep into the countryside and provide technical guidance and practical surveys to farmers for the management of tea gardens, so as to issue flour and benefit tea farmers. The team leader and corps leader Zhou Keyong, Liang Yu and team members have arrived in Lu'an first to start preparations.</p>

<h3>Su County Archives Society Established</h3>
<p>[Our Su County Dispatch] This county was occupied for eight years. Countless patriotic people were killed by the Japanese invaders and died in the Anti-Japanese War.

<h3>Zheng Tonghe Goes to Northern Jiangsu to Inspect and Will Seek to Eliminate the Canal Water Disaster</h3>
<p>[Zhenjiang Dispatch] Zheng Tonghe, the director of the Xingzong Su-Ning Branch, crossed the river to Yangzhou on the morning of the 6th, and transferred to Gaoyou Huan Ying, Huai'an, Huaiyin, and other counties to inspect the disaster situation in each district and guide the personnel sent by the branch to rush to release flour, winter clothes, and wheat seeds.

<h3>A Master of Unparalleled Skills Commits Countless Crimes: Shandong's Flying Thief, Yanzi Li San, Arrested for the Third Time in Jinan</h3>
<p>[Our Jinan Dispatch] The flying thief Li Shengwu (Yanzi Li San) had already been lurking in Jinan during the occupation, residing in Qinglong Street, Dongguan. In four years, he shot and killed three people and repeatedly robbed wealthy families and gold shops. He was once arrested after the victory, but unfortunately, he escaped en route during transfer. He then made an appearance at the Yusheng Dongtu Gao shop in the Daguanyuan. He remained at large for the past year, finally being arrested at the Maolai Inn on Guanyi Street in this city at 9 PM on the fourth of this month. A reporter, awed by the great name of the notorious flying thief Li Shengwu, who had roamed the north and south of the Yangtze River and committed countless crimes, visited Li Ximeng, the leader of the detective team of the police station that arrested Li, on the fifth to understand his true nature. He was led into Captain Yang's office, where the interrogation was taking place. There, in Captain Yang's office, he saw this figure with unparalleled skills. Li Shengwu was of medium height, with a long, round face. He was wearing only a black sleeping cap and a black short coat. He spoke with a Shandong Yucheng accent. His eyes were bright and piercing, and he sat on the sofa with such ease, listening to Captain Yang's detailed questioning, to which Li replied calmly.</p>
<p>Learning Skills Outside the Pass, First Taste of His Abilities</p>
<p>According to Li Shengwu, he is twenty-six years old this year and is from Li Village, Yucheng, Shandong. As a child, he attended private school for several years, but due to his mischievous nature, he could not get used to the rigid life and left home alone for Harbin. At the age of twelve, he met an extraordinary person and became his apprentice. There were three apprentices in total, one surnamed Hu, two surnamed Wu, and he—Li Shengwu—was the third. Later, in the martial world, he took the nickname "Yanzi Li San." At the age of sixteen, after mastering martial arts, the three apprentices joined together to roam the martial world. They displayed their unique skills in major cities and wharves in the nine northeastern provinces and officially entered the profession of theft. In 1933, they entered the Guannei (the region south of the Great Wall) together and operated in various places north and south of the Yangtze River. They committed countless major cases, relying solely on their martial arts, and never got caught. The name Yanzi Li San became even more famous. Later, the two elder brothers died one after another, leaving him alone. He continued to engage in this cost-free business until 1943 when he came to Jinan.</p>
<p>The Past Two Arrests</p>
<p>During his four years in Jinan, he committed many crimes, too many to remember. The main targets were gold shops and wealthy households. He only took gold, silver, cash, and valuables, nothing else. He remembers that in 1944, he stole more than thirty taels of pure gold from the Xinhengli Gold Shop. Unfortunately, the West District Police Precinct in the city found out, and he was arrested and sent to court, where he was sentenced to six months in prison. After escaping from prison, in early September 1945, he broke into the Ermei Swiss Watch Shop and stole more than forty pens and 400,000 yuan in cash. Afterward, in early August, the detectives Xue Liwen and Zhang Shouting discovered the clues and followed him to No. 38 Shenjia Hutong, Qinglong Street, Cheguandong (Li Dian's house). This was his second arrest. At that time, he was handcuffed with two pairs of foreign handcuffs and tied to a rickshaw, preparing to be escorted to the headquarters. He knew that his crimes were too serious, so he constantly thought about escaping. When the rickshaw went from Dongguan to the east end of Xiandong Lane Beitou Dongxicaiyuanzi, he seized the opportunity when the escorts were momentarily distracted and jumped onto the houses and escaped again.</p>
<p>Three Murders, Ruthless and Vicious</p>
<p>From then on, he harbored resentment towards Xue Liwen (the detective who arrested him) and prepared to retaliate at any time. In May 1946, one day at noon, he secretly carried a pistol to Xue Liwen's house on Xiaowangfu Street, claiming to have something to discuss. Coincidentally, Xue was out on business, so he sat in the house waiting. He smoked two packs of Qianmen cigarettes but Xue Liwen still didn't return. Growing impatient, he took out his pistol and shot both his grandmother and his mother, leaving three bullet casings on the table, intending to let Xue know how formidable I was. This matter, besides Xue himself, was known in great detail, so from then on, Li Laotou often used this as blackmail to ask me for money. After thinking it over again and again, I thought that if this continued, he would inevitably leak the secret to outsiders, so I decided to kill Li Laotou. One night, I led Li Laotou out for a walk, from Quehua Bridge to the base of the South City Wall of the South Gate. Seeing that no one was around, I shot and killed Li Laotou at the entrance of the Jiujunmen Alley, firing five shots in total. I then walked back to the commercial port and returned to Yucheng the next day.</p>
<p>Opening Fire in Daguanyuan to Resist Arrest</p>
<p>I remember one day, I was wearing a yellow railway worker's uniform and carrying a Nanfei-style pistol. I went to the Yusheng Dongtu Gao shop in Daguanyuan to smoke opium (it is said that Li met a pair of flower sisters in the Tu Gao shop). Originally, this pistol was Zhang ××'s, and I was going to pass it on to Captain Nie of the pseudo-Garrison Force. Unexpectedly, while I was smoking, I heard a commotion outside. The waiter loudly told everyone not to panic, that the Tu Gao shop was being investigated. Suddenly, I noticed several burly men behind the waiter, who turned out to be detectives. I immediately dropped my opium pipe, pulled out my pistol. Although some detectives had already entered the opium couch, they turned around and ran out when they saw me holding a pistol. I hurriedly grabbed my clothes and ran to the kitchen, then climbed to a high place from the kitchen, crossed over several civilian houses, walked to the north end of Daguanyuan, followed the scaffolding built by a house under construction, walked to Weier Road, and escaped again.</p>
<p>Left Leg Wounded, Finally Caught in the Net of Justice</p>
<p>A few days ago, I returned to Jinan from Yancheng, intending to buy some groceries to take back for business. I stayed in the east room of the Maolai Inn on Guanyi Street, because the owner was an old acquaintance, a friend introduced by my fellow villager Li Sitong. But because of my secretive movements, I was finally discovered by the detectives. So, the day before yesterday, under a tight encirclement, this tiger with wings was wounded in the left leg, unable to leap onto the roof and use his old tricks, and was put in shackles and pushed into the iron cage of national law.</p>

<h3>Handling of Students from the Temporary University Preparatory Class</h3>
<p>—Reply from the Ministry of Education Regarding Students in That Class—</p>
<p>Dear Sir: In order to help students from specialized schools and above in the recovered areas to continue their studies, the Ministry previously established temporary university preparatory classes in Peiping, Qingdao, Nanjing, Shanghai, Wuhan, Shenyang, and other places. Students who had studied at pseudo-specialized schools and above were enrolled in these classes to receive preparatory training and examination. After the preparatory period, students with excellent conduct and examination results that met the following standards would be assigned to schools by the Ministry.</p>
<p>(1) Those who passed all subjects in the preparatory and basic courses would be promoted and assigned.</p>
<p>(2) Those whose grades in all specialized preparatory courses were above 75 points, and students who took basic courses and failed one subject or failed two basic courses but had grades above 75 points in all preparatory courses, would be assigned to repeat the grade.</p>
<p>Those who did not meet the above conditions would not be assigned and should take the school entrance examination themselves. The Ministry had already established the "Measures for the Graduation Examination and Assignment of Students Upon Completion of Preparatory Training in Temporary University Preparatory Classes" and notified all classes. Students in Peiping, Qingdao, Shanghai, Nanjing, Wuhan, and other preparatory classes who had completed their preparatory training had already been reviewed and assigned by the Ministry. As for the students in the Wuhan Temporary University Preparatory Class, they only studied the teachings of Sun Yat-sen and the speeches of Chairman Mao, Chinese language, English, Chinese history, Chinese geography, and selected one or two of the following subjects: general algebra and algebra, analytical geometry and geometry, introduction to philosophy, jurisprudence, general biology, physics, chemistry, and introduction to calculus (some did not select any). Of the 77 students recommended for admission without examination by the class, 15 were found to have false academic qualifications or forged documents, 5 attended original schools that were not at the university level or did not meet the admission requirements, 5 did not submit documents or had problematic documents, and 48 were from schools that had already started and should return to their original schools (a small number of these also had problematic academic qualifications). Another 5 students were assigned to other schools. The remaining students who did not meet the standards should still take the school entrance examination themselves in accordance with the regulations. According to the academic qualifications they filled in, 68 of them could return to their original schools. However, recently, some students have been circulating printed materials and sending appeals to newspapers under the name of the "Wuhan Temporary University Petition Group" (the Ministry only has preparatory classes and has not established this type of university). The Ministry assigns students to schools in accordance with the original regulations. All students whose academic performance is not excellent should make extra efforts to study in preparation for taking the school entrance examination again. As for the small number of students with false academic qualifications or forged documents, their student status cannot be recognized in accordance with the regulations. To prevent the public from misunderstanding the truth, this letter is hereby sent for your reference, hoping that you will publish the original letter in the "Reader's Opinions" column.

<h3>Public Servants' Work Morale</h3>
<p>I remember at a recent meeting, our county magistrate said in his report, "In recent days, the efficiency of this government has not only failed to improve but has also declined imperceptibly. Most of the daily office hours are not in accordance with the regulations. The morning office hours are from 7:30 AM, but often no one arrives in the office until 9:00 AM. The afternoon office hours are until 5:30 PM, but often everyone leaves before 5:00 PM." In this statement, I deeply feel why there is such negligence. How could Magistrate Hu not understand that the main reason is the meager salary and the lack of proper management, which makes people lack the spirit and morale to work? Everyone is just thinking of getting through the day. Speaking of salary, it is really pitiful. At the county level, senior staff earn an average of 70,000 yuan per month (self-supplied), junior staff earn 50,000 yuan per month (self-supplied), and public laborers earn 25,000 yuan per month (self-supplied). But the prices outside are increasing rapidly. The county magistrate always says at every meeting that he will try his best to increase salaries, but in reality, it still requires the financial authorities to believe that the financial revenue and expenditure are balanced and that the finances are sufficient before there can be a real improvement. Otherwise, the result is still a pie in the sky that cannot satisfy hunger. It is always said that with the current prices increasing without end and our extremely low income, even if we were given twice the salary, it would still not be enough. What can we do with this little money?</p>
<p>As for our food, it is even more pitiful, needless to say. What we eat every day really has no nutritional value—because the pressure of salary and life is overwhelming, many people have left recently, holding onto hope is like waiting for a rabbit to fall from a tree, completely hopeless! The most pitiful are our junior staff, who put in the greatest effort in their work, but the rewards they enjoy are far less than those of laborers! However, we hope that the wise authorities will consider improving the situation for us junior staff. As the saying goes, everyone has a sense of compassion! (Jin Jiaxiang)</p>
<h3>Heavy Penalties for Excess Baggage</h3>
<p>We are all educated people who were displaced by the brutal and unreasonable invasion of the Japanese invaders, causing us to lose our jobs. Although the Japanese invaders have now surrendered, the conflict between the Nationalists and Communists has not ended, and most businesses have not yet recovered. To make a living, we have no choice but to work as peddlers like beasts of burden. But there are a few questions. As far as we know, personal baggage (1) is allowed to weigh 20 kilograms per person. If it exceeds 20 kilograms, a baggage ticket must be purchased. (2) Baggage tickets are managed by the so-called "black hats" (porters). (3) There is a receipt for the purchase of a baggage ticket. However, the Jiashan Station is the opposite. Baggage tickets are managed by railway police. Even if the baggage is less than 20 kilograms, a baggage ticket is required (4,000 yuan). If it exceeds 20 kilograms, there is no baggage ticket, and a fine of 10,000, 20,000, or 30,000 yuan or more is imposed, but there is no receipt. Alas! After being fined tens of thousands of yuan like this, we have to make three or four trips for nothing! Recalling the time of the enemy and puppets, doing business as peddlers required "buying a passage." Now that victory has been achieved, although there is no "buying a passage," there is unreasonable fining. How can this be justified! The railway authorities must strictly prohibit this!

<h3>Earlier Time for Emptying Night Soil Buckets</h3>
<p>In the vicinity of Minguo Road and Dajing Road in the southern part of the city, every morning around nine o'clock, night soil carts are lined up on the streets, and the stench permeates the air. Passersby cover their noses and pass by. This not only hinders the business of shops but also affects traffic order. Moreover, Shanghai is for international observation, and this really harms the essential principles of hygiene. If the time for emptying the night soil buckets is advanced, the above-mentioned shortcomings can be reduced, and the health habits of early rising among citizens can be promoted. It is rumored that the city has recently implemented a cleaning campaign, so the health authorities should seriously consider this issue. (Zhou Wuxing)</p>

<p>This afternoon, while passing by the vicinity of the railway station on Triumph Road, I saw a truck loaded with garbage (license plate number Hu 30245) dumping a full load of refuse on the vacant land beside the road. I hope the relevant authorities will pay attention. (Zhang Li)</p>

<h3>US Notifies China, Britain and 16 Other Countries: Negotiating Tariff Reduction Agreements; International Trade Conference Scheduled for Next Spring</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 9th] The US State Department will today formally notify China, Britain, Australia, France, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Cuba, Czechoslovakia, India, Lebanon, Luxembourg, Poland, New Zealand, Norway, South Africa, and the Soviet Union, a total of 18 countries. They will be informed that the US is willing to negotiate mutual tariff reduction agreements with them. However, it is not yet known whether the Republican Party will support this economic policy. Deputy Secretary of State Clayton said that the Republican Party has not yet expressed support for the government's political or economic policies. However, it is generally said that many influential Republicans support the system of international free trade in order to abolish military barriers, excessively high tariffs, and deliberate discrimination. The conference proposed by the US will be held in Geneva next April. After the conference, even if an agreement is not reached with the 18 countries, the US will conduct negotiations with each country individually in order to reach an agreement. Clayton also said that the US is willing to allow countries whose industries are still in their infancy, such as India, to maintain protectionist trade policies for a specific period of time. However, it is believed that the maintenance of this policy must have a definite time limit. According to Acting Secretary of State Acheson, the US government's announcement is another step forward in the plan for international economic cooperation, and it is the largest-scale negotiation on mutual trade agreements. The US will ask other major countries to make concessions on tariffs and other items on most of the goods exported by the US. In the negotiations, the US will also collect information on restrictions or discrimination encountered by US export trade. The US wants the proposed trade agreement to contain a clause similar to the US trade clause, namely, that if domestic industries suffer serious damage due to unforeseen circumstances, the provisions of the concessions may be revised or revoked. According to Brown, Director of the Commercial Policy Department of the State Department, the 18 countries were recommended by the Economic and Social Council of the United Nations, and other countries are welcome to join in the future.</p>
<h3>UN General Assembly Passes Resolution to Locate Permanent Headquarters in the US; Membership Applications of Afghanistan and Two Other Countries Approved; Resolution on Conference of Non-Self-Governing Peoples Also Passed</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 9th] After a slow-moving committee meeting on the 7th, the UN General Assembly reconvened today to discuss various agendas for four hours. The situation of the meeting is recorded as follows: (1) After behind-the-scenes coordination by our country's representative, Xian Weijun, the General Assembly unanimously accepted the membership applications of Iceland, Sweden, and Afghanistan; (2) The General Assembly resolved to reconsider the permanent headquarters of the United Nations being located anywhere within the United States; (3) The General Assembly verbally voted to pass Egypt's proposal to include the draft resolution on forcing and discriminating against human rights on the agenda of the General Assembly. Other items passed by the General Assembly for inclusion on the agenda today were: (1) Lebanon's suggestion regarding the preservation and publication of classical literature, and the request for the United Nations to establish an advisory body; (2) The suggestions of Cuba, India, and Panama regarding crimes against race, and the suggestion of the Philippines regarding convening a conference of non-self-governing peoples (according to the Philippine representative, the conference should be held annually so that the United Nations can contrast the problems of non-self-governing peoples with the problems of independent peoples). The General Assembly also accepted the Secretary-General's report stating that the Security Council will no longer deal with the Spanish question, and therefore requested the General Assembly to postpone the discussion until the next General Assembly.</p>
<h3>Bulgarian Troops Gather on Greek-Turkish Border; Aircraft Appear Overhead</h3>
<p>[United Press, Athens, 10th] The Greek Propaganda Department issued a bulletin today stating that Bulgarian mechanized units and aircraft are concentrated near the border between Bulgaria, Greece, and Turkey. The bulletin did not estimate the number of Bulgarian troops there, but only stated, "According to a report from the command of the Thracian Defense Force, Bulgarian mechanized units are seen concentrated near the border between the three countries, and new aircraft have appeared over Bulgarian airfields in the area." The bulletin also stated that, according to a report from the Soufli Defense Force command, a Bulgarian military officer named Lieutenant Colonel Korokanov, "formerly held an important position in the Bulgarian Army Department, and has recently 'automatically surrendered' to the Greek advanced defense forces on Mount Beles."</p>
<h3>Portuguese Prime Minister's Speech Praises Soviet Achievements</h3>

<h3>Czech Foreign Minister Broadcasts in Support of the United Nations</h3>
<p>[United Press, New York, 10th] Czech Foreign Minister Masaryk said in a broadcast here today: "There is no path to peace other than through the United Nations organization.

<h3>Wallace's Speech: Focusing on Vandenberg; Advocating Truman Should Remain in Office</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 9th] Former Secretary of Commerce Wallace told reporters today that although President Truman will face a Senate and House of Representatives controlled by the Republican Party, for the sake of the national interest, Truman should continue to serve as president. He is better than either Vandenberg or Byrnes. Wallace continued to mention his policy of "not being too tough on the Soviet Union" and said that before the election, he traveled throughout the country and felt that if the Democratic Party could adopt a true American policy aimed at peace, instead of adopting Vandenberg's tough policy, the election results for the Democratic Party might not have been so tragic.</p>
<h3>World War II Memorial Unveiled in London Yesterday; King, Queen, Former Prime Ministers Participate</h3>

<h3>Jewish Secret Radio Station Claims to Expand the Scope of Terror; Riots Erupt Again in Jerusalem Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch] London, 10th, Broadcasting from London: Riots broke out again in Jerusalem today. The train station was bombed, causing many deaths and injuries.</p>
<p>[United Press, London, 9th] The police headquarters has dispatched additional police to guard major government buildings today to prevent unlawful acts by Jewish terrorist groups.

<p>[Reuters, London, 10th] According to reports from Vienna, it is rumored that Jewish terrorists in the area intend to demonstrate in Vienna on the anniversary of the occupation of Vienna by Germany. British troops and German soldiers have taken strict precautions.</p>
<h3>Attlee Delivers Speech: Britain Strives for Peace, Must Maintain Strength While Universal Security Remains Unestablished, Solving the German Question is Key to European Prosperity</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 9th] Prime Minister Attlee addressed the traditional Lord Mayor of London's banquet today, declaring Britain's determination to continue advancing towards its peaceful goals and to alleviate the heavy burden of armaments on the world's people. The Prime Minister, when speaking of the United Nations organization, particularly emphasized the point of transferring sovereignty. He reiterated that a satisfactory solution to the German question is essential for European peace and prosperity. He also solemnly declared that until a sense of security and trust is re-established in the world, Britain must maintain its defense forces and preserve its national strength. He stated that the British government bears a great responsibility to the people at home and in the Commonwealth and Empire, and cannot relinquish this responsibility until a more certain security is secured to replace the current situation.</p>
<p>Hopes for the United Nations</p>
<p>I believe many people are disappointed with the way the United Nations has been operating. The entire mechanism is mired in distrust due to unreasonable attacks and obstruction in the assembly. We can assert that if the United Nations organization is used as a forum for debating prejudices, it will undoubtedly fail. Only if this organization can guarantee the safety and freedom of all countries and their way of life, while contributing to the benefit of the entire world, can the United Nations organization succeed. We believe that when discussing each issue, we must first ask ourselves, "Will this solution contribute to the advancement of peace and understanding?" I believe that the people in every corner of the world long for real peace and disarmament, so that the various problems of the world can be resolved on this basis.</p>
<p>Actions Demonstrate Endurance of Accusations</p>
<p>For this reason, my friend, Foreign Secretary Bevin, whether in United Nations meetings, when receiving reporters, or in broadcast speeches, has tried his best to avoid responding to those who attack Britain. It is better to demonstrate with facts than to reply with words. Our actions in India, Burma, and elsewhere in the colonial empire can vividly demonstrate that the British Empire and the Commonwealth are not motivated by imperialism. We must continue to strive towards our peaceful ideals and reduce the heavy burden of armaments on the world's people. However, I must make it clear here that disarmament cannot be unilateral. While widespread trust and security are being established in the world, we must maintain our defense capabilities and remain strong.</p>
<p>Regarding Germany: Considering All Aspects</p>
<p>Continuing on the German question, he said that a satisfactory solution to the German question is the key to European prosperity, peace, and stability. We must not allow Central Europe to become a base for cheap, malnourished, and lazy labor, as such phenomena can lead to a lowering of our living standards. Therefore, we must act cautiously, but we will also never allow Germany's industry to become an arsenal for promoting new wars again. We should carefully consider both of these points when implementing our policy towards Germany. We have considered various possible solutions and have also proposed our own, and we are willing to discuss them openly. In short, establishing a Europe where many countries can coexist peacefully, each enjoying its traditional culture and ideas, is a necessary condition for world peace, and resolving the German question is the most important key to dealing with the entire issue.</p>
<h3>Four-Power Foreign Ministers' Meeting: Review of One Week's Work, Trieste Issue to Promote Direct Negotiations, Soviet Union Still Insists on Opposing Danube Navigation</h3>
<p>[Reuters, New York, 10th] After a week of the Foreign Ministers' Meeting in New York, there are still no signs that the previous difficulties can be resolved. On Trieste, the Danube, and other thorny issues, the four powers have only reiterated their previous positions without any changes. The border provisions of the Italian peace treaty have not yet been discussed by the four powers. Some observers believe that the four powers intend to give Italy and Yugoslavia sufficient time to conduct direct negotiations. Judging from recent developments in Rome and Belgrade, the two sides seem to be getting closer. What is currently lacking is full cooperation between Rome, Belgrade, and New York, so the removal of domestic politics by the Italian or Yugoslav government may at any time conflict with the four powers' encouragement of compromise between the two countries. For example, Tito's suggestion of exchanging Trieste for Gorizia seems to have little connection with the approach taken by the Yugoslav Foreign Minister Tomic in New York. The four foreign ministers' step-by-step discussion of the Romanian peace treaty did not show that the Soviet Union was willing to change its previous position and abandon its opposition to the Western countries' participation in the issue of Danube navigation rights being included in the treaty. In addition, an important principle has been established. Molotov has repeatedly raised the opinions of the minority countries rejected at the Paris Peace Conference during the week, meaning that the Soviet Union is at least prepared to recognize that the Foreign Ministers' Meeting may adopt final decisions on the suggestions of a minority or majority in the Paris Peace Conference.</p>
<h3>London Holds Lord Mayor's Show: Annual Parade</h3>
<p>Two-Mile-Long Procession, Only Seen After the War</p>
<p>[United Press, London, 9th] London's new Lord Mayor, Smith, will take office next year. Today's Lord Mayor's Show parade was two miles long, the longest seen in years. The crowds thronged to the Lord Mayor's residence. The new Lord Mayor came from humble beginnings, starting as a $7-a-week bellboy and rising to become the manager of a West End hotel.</p>
<h3>US Revokes Price Controls: Rent, Sugar, Rice, and Livestock Among Them, Truman to Deliver Broadcast Speech Today</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 10th] President Truman announced last night that all national price controls, except for rent, sugar, and rice, will be lifted from today. He said that the current method of price control is not effective, and returning to a free economy will promote healthy production. Since some goods are still in short supply, prices may increase after the price limits are lifted.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 9th] President Truman, due to the results of the general election, said that the people of the whole country have expressed their disgust with the wartime price control policy. Today he ordered the abolition of all asset and price restriction regulations, except for rent and sugar. Rent may be raised appropriately. The President's decree stated: From now on, the law of market supply and demand will be used freely, which will be better for the people than the government's continued control of commodity prices. The parity law was originally forced, and now that it has lost the support of the people, it cannot achieve practical results. The Price Administration is temporarily retained, and the transmission host should be appropriate.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 9th Special Dispatch] The White House announced today: Truman will issue a statement on policy on the 11th. White House Secretary Ross said: This statement has not yet been drafted, so it cannot be detailed. Most people believe that the US foreign policy remains unchanged, so the statement is expected to mainly address domestic issues. According to Senator Kerr, a visiting Democratic Party member who visited the US President today, Truman will announce his plan on the restoration of peacetime status on foreign and domestic affairs in the short term.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 9th] According to people close to President Truman: The President is scheduled to deliver a broad speech to the people of the country on the 11th of this month, at which time he will announce that he will place the interests of the country above all personal and party interests. At the same time, he will also issue a brief statement to the press, calling on the Republican Party to cooperate with the government.</p>
<h3>Gandhi Appeals to Muslims: Please Protect Hindus</h3>

<p>[Agence France-Presse, Chandernagore, India, 9th] The All India Radio Station issued a message saying: Mahatma Gandhi went to the areas in Bihar Province where Hindu-Muslim conflicts occurred to inspect. He convened a meeting of local officials here today, delivered a speech saying: I always hope that India can implement Pakistan (the partition of India and Pakistan), but I do not want to achieve this goal at the expense of millions of people. The minority ethnic group in Bihar Province is composed of Hindu Indians, not Muslims, so Muslims should protect their Hindu compatriots and must try their best to make the people happy and united. Saint Wei had a little fruit for water today. His followers were all pleased when asked about it, but he is still prepared to fast at any time.</p>
<p>[Our Report] London, 10th Radio: Conflicts in India occurred again today and intensified. In the Chirala area, 300 people died and countless were injured.</p>

<h3>French National Assembly Election: Westward Democracy or Eastward Communism, Results to be Known After Public Voting</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 10th] France and its overseas territories today elected the first National Assembly of the Fourth Republic. This is the ninth time the French people have held elections in two years. The National Assembly includes 619 members, 32 more than the Second Constituent Assembly. The allocation of seats is as follows: 544 seats in mainland France, 30 seats in the North African Algerian territory, and 45 seats in overseas territories. After the general election on the 14th, that is, on the 24th of this month, the country will also elect members of the Council of State of the Republic, which is the second chamber of the National Assembly, including 315 members. The Council of State will hold its first meeting on December 24 this year, but the two chambers must convene a formal meeting in early January next year to elect the President of the Republic, who will appoint the Prime Minister of the Cabinet. The government institutions of the Fourth Republic will then begin to operate, and the task of the provisional government will come to an end.</p>
<h3>26 Million Voters, 3,000 Candidates</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 10th] France's 26 million male and female citizens are scheduled to elect the first parliament after liberation today. There are 3,000 candidates in France and overseas territories, competing for 618 seats in Congress. The main political parties running for election are the Communist Party, the Socialist Party, the People's Republican Party, the Radical Party, and the conservative Republican Freedom Party. There is no doubt that the three major parties will continue to hold leading positions, but whether the Communist Party can obtain the most seats in Congress is of great concern to the general public. Semi-official sources, according to estimates from the Ministry of the Interior, say that the Conservative Party, the Radical Party, and the Communist Party can gain more seats, the Socialist Party has no gorgeous entry, and the People's Republican Party will lose seats.</p>
<h3>No Matter Which Party Wins: Will Eventually Form a Coalition Government</h3>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 10th] Like other European countries after the war, French voters will choose between Eastern Communism and Western democracy, which is the root cause of the first congressional campaign in the Fourth French Republic. The People's Republican Party said that the Communist Party accepts Moscow's command; the Communist Party said that the People's Republican Party only listens to the Roman Curia. (The People's Republican Party also calls it the Catholic Progressive Party.) The People's Republican Party said: This is a struggle between matter and spirit, dictatorship and freedom. The Communist Party said: This is a struggle between democracy and reactionaries.</p>
<p>In the previous two elections, each party showed that it had more than five million party members; in the most recent constituent assembly, the People's Republican Party occupied 166 seats out of 576 seats, and the Communist Party occupied 153 seats. Neither party was able to obtain a majority party position. This time, the Congress has 618 seats, 31 more than the Constituent Assembly, so it wants to be a majority party. You must obtain 310 seats. Under France's multi-party system, no party has the opportunity to obtain such a majority. No matter which party wins, it must contact the smaller parties to form a coalition government.</p>
<h3>Political Balance of the Three Major Parties: Unlikely to be Shaken Due to Elections</h3>
<p>[Also from the 9th] France and its territories are scheduled to elect the first National Assembly of the Fourth Republic tomorrow. This election is largely a contest between the Communist Party and the People's Republican Party. Both parties have stated: If they can obtain a majority in Congress, they will exclude each other from the new cabinet. Although the People's Republican Party wants to win the support of the de Gaulle faction and promises to form a centrist government after winning, political observers predict that the results of this election will not shake the political balance jointly maintained by the Communist Party, the People's Republican Party, and the Socialist Party. The new government will generally still be a coalition government of various parties.</p>
<h3>World's Largest Transport Plane: Test Flight Results Good, Weighs 92 Tons, Speed 300 Miles Per Hour</h3>

<h3>US Sets Up Intelligence Agencies Everywhere: To Prevent Party Activities</h3>

<h3>Japanese Assets in China and Korea: Soviet Union Still Refuses to Use as Compensation Items, US Has Notified Soviet Union of Its Opinions on This Matter</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 9th] United Press has exclusively learned from blind sources today: The United States is conducting negotiations with the Soviet Union on the matter of dividing up Japanese assets in Korea. The State Department has informed the Soviet Union, stating that it is willing to leave this asset in Korea, but only on the condition that this asset be left for the use of Koreans, and the Soviet Union must not interfere. This matter was first initiated by the United States' suggestion that the Far East Commission discuss the issue of Japanese compensation. The Soviet Union immediately claimed that this meeting was not within the scope of discussion on all Japanese assets abroad, especially in Korea. The US responded by saying: It is willing to leave Japanese assets in Korea to the Koreans, but it cannot be given to the Soviet Union. This dispute has not yet been resolved. Further compromises can be made only after the Soviet Union clarifies its attitude towards whether the Far East Commission has the right to discuss Japanese legacy issues. The State Department invited countries from the Far East Commission to convene a Japanese compensation meeting, and only the Soviet Union refused to participate. The Soviet Union is now asking to participate on the condition that Japanese assets abroad not be discussed. Its intention is probably not only to limit the meeting to Japanese property in Korea, but also to ensure that the Japanese industrial equipment that the Soviet Union has fully loaded from northeastern China will not be raised for discussion. In addition, in order to speed up the distribution of Japanese compensation outside the Far East Committee, the United States has asked the countries concerned in the East Committee to consult with the United States in order to draft temporary instructions to inform MacArthur how to proceed, and to distribute 15% to 20% of Japanese domestic assets that have been designated for compensation to countries that claim compensation first.</p>
<h3>The Soviet Union Fought Japan for Six Days: Gained Greatly in the Northeast</h3>
<p>No Wonder Most of the Countrymen are Filled with Anger: Bowley Survey Team Member Declared Yesterday</p>
<p>[United Press, San Francisco, 9th] Mining engineer Clement of the Japanese Legacy Survey Team led by Bowley said at a banquet at the Federal Club here today: The Soviet military occupation of the East Jiulong provinces of China caused chaos in the industry there, causing resentment among the Chinese. After the industrial equipment in the East Jiulong provinces was moved away, the seeds of social unrest were sown. China resisted Japan for eight years, and the Soviet Union only fought Japan for six days, but gained greatly. It is no wonder that most of the people are filled with anger and extreme fear for the future.</p>
<h3>Chaplin Films: New Film "Landru"</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 9th] According to rumors here, Hollywood's veteran comedian Chaplin will settle in France and spend his old age there as soon as the new "Landru" is finished. The new film is based on real events. After World War I, there was a French pervert, Lundreu, who married many wives one after another. One of his wives was found burned to death in the stove, and Chaplin played the protagonist in the story.</p>
<h3>A Look at Yankee Industry and Agriculture: A Prediction of the American Economic Future</h3>
<p>— Our Newspaper's Special Correspondent in the United States, Mao Shuqing</p>
<p>[New York Airmail, October 9th] Some economists in London pessimistically predict that the United States will experience an unprecedented economic "depression" in the near future. The reason for this depression is due to economic imbalances and a sharp decline in the massive wartime national income, which will completely disconnect production and consumption mechanisms. British economists even predict that the depression will be even more terrible than in 1929, to the point where Wall Street banks will all close, factories will shut down, and stores will go bankrupt? Then, it will gradually recover, similar to the situations in 1933 and 1934.</p>
<p>The predictions from London have caused extreme resentment in New York and Washington. American economists, especially the experts of Roosevelt's "New Deal," have put forward many forceful defenses. They acknowledge that the American economic recovery is difficult, but national consumption remains at its original level. The general national income will not suddenly decrease in the recent years, although "there are many difficult factors involved." The economic problems of the richest countries are the most difficult to solve. No country in the world has a more deformed and chaotic economic situation than the United States today. There is no gasoline, no white sugar, no pork; these are the major shortages, and even milk is not easy to buy. A few days ago, there was a truck driver strike, and even matches were unavailable. Now that the truck strike has just ended, the sailors are now striking. After the sailors got a raise, the dockworkers are also "refusing to work." Many factories have stopped working; factory owners would rather have their machines sit idle and rust than produce at a loss.</p>
<p>Congress is debating economic problems all day long. Michigan Republican Congressman Hoffman is roaring like a madman: "Please let the government disclose the truth about price controls! Thousands upon thousands of factories are gradually shutting down; raw materials cannot be bought, and finished products have price limits. This is the end of America." He publicly stated: "We Republicans cannot stand these strange things. The Republican Party is determined to overthrow the OPA (Office of Price Administration)!"</p>
<p>What methods will the Republican Party use to overthrow the OPA? No matter how Congress roars and how much ability they use, the Office of Price Administration still stands firm. The head of the Office of Price Administration, Paul, is not only the "it" person in Washington today but also one of Truman's economic advisors. A few days ago, there were rumors that Paul would be appointed Secretary of Commerce, and the "New York Daily News" surprisingly wrote: "Oh, my God! This is terrible!"</p>
<p>In fact, the current government of the Democratic Party will not change its current economic policies. The Department of Commerce has been continuously publishing various statistics, proving the improvement of the post-war economic situation. For example, in August, the total transaction volume of department stores across the United States reached $1,625,510,000, an increase of 20% compared to August 1945. The turnover of manufacturers nationwide for the three months of June, July, and August increased by 36.7%. The turnover of retail stores nationwide in August increased by 44% compared to August of last year and also increased by 11% compared to July of this year. Another report from the Department of Commerce stated that exports of industrial manufacturers across the United States increased by more than $30,000,000 in August, creating a new record of $1,830,000,000 in total production value; however, among many manufacturers, there was no increase in the automobile industry or the hardware industry; the canned meat industry, the soap industry, and the leather industry even saw a decrease.</p>
<p>Among industrial manufacturers, the fastest-growing and most profitable industries are the cigarette industry and the paper industry. The leather industry in the United States is almost "hopeless." During the war, it was impossible to buy leather suitcases, leather bags, and leather purses for women in the American market. After the war, although many leather factories resumed operations, there was still a shortage of raw materials. The head of the "Mobilization and Reconversion Bureau," Timon, recently hosted Washington reporters and said: "The Mobilization and Reconversion Bureau has decided to reward leather manufacturers for importing raw cowhide from abroad to strengthen the leather industry. The finished products will not be subject to price restrictions." According to estimates by those in charge of the leather industry, 30% of the leather currently used in the United States comes from overseas. As for the export of leather finished products, he shook his head and said: "At most, one percent."</p>
<p>Besides leather, the United States is also lacking rubber. During the war, most of the rubber in the United States was transported from South America (especially from Brazil). The weather, geography, and environment of the United States do not allow for the cultivation of high-quality rubber trees, just like not being able to cultivate high-quality tung oil trees. Recently, the United States ordered 60,000 tons of rubber from England, to be delivered before the end of this year. In addition, a trade agreement was signed with England, allowing British businessmen to grow forests in Malaya.</p>
<p>What is overproduced is cotton. This year's cotton harvest in the southern United States is again abundant, and the sales of cotton will definitely be in surplus. The National Production Bureau of the U.S. government plans to gradually reduce cotton production each year to avoid affecting the price of cotton and the cotton textile industry. The first step is to reduce by 10%, and then gradually decrease each year.</p>
<p>The cotton problem is not the core of the economic illness. The key to the current economic imbalance in the United States still lies in the disconnect between industrial production and how to adjust wages and costs. According to the recent business report from the Federal Reserve Bank, companies in many cities across the country have made huge profits in September; however, companies that have always relied on factories as their main source of income have been greatly impacted. In Pittsburgh, the largest heavy industry center in the United States, the business of shops throughout the city decreased by 71% in September due to the power workers' strike. As a result, many small shops have closed down.</p>
<p>The situation in agriculture is the most stable and optimistic. American agricultural economists have always advocated reducing the rural population to increase the individual cultivated land of farmers. As a result of the four years of war, 4,000,000 American farmers left the countryside due to the war; however, agricultural production did not decrease due to the reduction in the rural population. On the contrary, the total value of agricultural production increased by a quarter compared to before the war. The industrialization of agriculture across the United States and the large-scale use of machinery and new-style farms are one reason; the other reason is the good facilities for water conservancy and irrigation, which have established an unshakable foundation for the countryside.</p>
<p>In order to balance the 1947 federal government budget, President Truman reduced two-thirds of the next year's "water conservancy expenditure," totaling approximately $500,000,000. A group of congressmen from rural areas were greatly angered by this. They formed a subcommittee to ask Truman to explain in person. The two leaders of this group were Senator McKellar and Senator Stewart from Tennessee, the home of the TVA. In addition, there was Congressman Whittington from Mississippi, Congressman Harris from Arkansas, and Congressman Bauken from Alabama. "Why take frugality measures on water conservancy? Moreover, a reduction of 65% is being made!" Congressman Beall from Maryland described Truman's frugality as "municipal council"-style accounting. Congressman Bauken from Alabama said very vehemently that the president had no right to cut the water conservancy expenditure approved by Congress. He said: "We have many ways to balance the budget. Why not send less supplies to Yugoslavia?"</p>
<p>President Truman personally attended their meeting. The President admired their sincerity in seeking happiness for the farmers. The President said very apologetically: "I will definitely accept your opinions. Let me consider it again at length."</p>
<p>This case was considered to have come to a conclusion in this way. A Chinese reporter who was listening in could not help but be particularly moved. We are a country that "establishes the country on agriculture." What should we do?</p>

<h3>The Hardoon Estate is in Dispute Again: Twelve Relatives are Preparing to Sue in Court Again, Demanding Treatment According to Iraqi Law and Equal Distribution of Three-Quarters of the Entire Estate</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The Hardoon estate case, which has been in dispute for fifteen years, has been revived after its victory. Twelve Iraqi relatives of Hardoon, after months of preparation, are planning to file a major lawsuit again, submitting their petition to the local court of this city, demanding an analysis of the estate. A reporter visited the attorney representing them, Song Yunhui, yesterday. According to him:</p>
<p>The crux of this case is the issue of Silas Aaron Hardoon's nationality. Hardoon was never naturalized as a British citizen but was instead an Iraqi Jewish national residing in our country. He was born in 1853 in the city of Baghdad, Iraq. At that time, Iraq was a French protectorate. After Silas Aaron Hardoon passed away in June 1931, the French authorities certified and issued Silas Aaron Hardoon with a "Certificate of Loss of Nationality." At the same time, the British High Court only referred to Hardoon as an Iraqi national under British protection. The British Consul stationed in this city also certified that there was no record of Hardoon being naturalized as a British citizen. As such, Hardoon's nationality as Iraqi is extremely obvious.</p>
<p>Since Hardoon's estate is in China, according to international law, it should be handled in accordance with Chinese law. Article 20 of Chapter 4 of the Law Application Regulations in Chinese law states: "Inheritance shall be governed by the national law of the deceased." Article 21: "The essential requirements and effect of a will shall be governed by the national law of the testator at the time of its establishment." Article 14: "The essential requirements for the establishment of an adopted child shall be governed by the national law of the parties concerned, and the effect of an adopted child shall be governed by the national law of the adoptive parents." Therefore, the Hardoon estate should be handled in accordance with Iraqi law.</p>
<p>According to Iraqi inheritance law: If the deceased has no direct descendants, the spouse shall receive one-quarter of the total value of the estate, and three-quarters shall be equally divided among close relatives.</p>
<p>Hardoon Family Genealogy</p>
<p>Attorney Zhu further narrated the family genealogy of Silas Aaron Hardoon, stating: Hardoon's grandfather was named Abraham (Lo Rhim) and had three sons. The eldest son, Aaron, was Silas Aaron Hardoon's biological father. The second son, Abrabi, had two sons. The eldest son, Mir, only had one son named Sion, who is Silas Aaron Hardoon's grandnephew. In 1932, the Baghdad court ruled that he was one of Silas Aaron Hardoon's twelve legal heirs. The other eleven people are Sion's cousins Ezra, Yaronb, Naham, Sanl, Homgui, Saleh Abrahin, Saleh Yaconb, Moechi, and the grandsons of Silas Aaron Hardoon's three paternal uncles, Ezra, Nahom, and Ibrahim.</p>
<p>Five years after Silas Aaron Hardoon's death, one of these twelve people filed a lawsuit in the British court against Hardoon's wife, Luo Jialu, demanding the analysis of the estate in accordance with Iraqi law. However, at that time, the British government coveted this huge amount of inheritance tax and wanted to fight for the right to vote for the former Municipal Council. Therefore, it forcibly recognized Hardoon as a person under British protection and stated that he should be subject to British law. As a result, Luo Jialu won the case. In November 1941, another person filed a lawsuit with the British Procuratorate stationed in this city. However, due to the outbreak of the Pacific War, this case was shelved without being heard.</p>
<p>Denial of Adopted Children</p>
<p>Luo Jialu's death in October 1941 and the victory of our country's War of Resistance against Japan, which abolished consular jurisdiction, have transferred the Hardoon estate dispute to another environment. Therefore, the twelve Iraqis recently commissioned Attorney Song to prepare to file a lawsuit and requested two points from the authorities: (1) If the authorities deem it necessary to form another management office to manage the Hardoon property, one of the twelve people must be invited to participate. (2) Those who claim to be Hardoon's adopted children must not participate in the management of the Hardoon estate. They also sent a letter to the Land Administration Bureau requesting it to stop the transfer of the estate.</p>
<p>The Hardoon estate was estimated to be worth approximately £4,000,000 in 1931 (the amount acknowledged by Luo Jialu). After the war, the currency of the Allied countries depreciated, and real estate prices soared. Therefore, the current value of the estate cannot be accurately estimated, but it will definitely be an astronomical figure. What these twelve people are currently considering is that the amount of the estate is too large. If this is used as the subject matter of the lawsuit, the litigation costs will also be an alarming figure, which they are unable to bear. After much consideration, it has now been decided that lawsuits will be filed individually to reduce litigation costs. Moreover, if they lose the lawsuit, the other eleven people can continue their long-term struggle.</p>
<h3>Three Groups, Including the City Council, Host a Banquet for the Siamese Delegation: Piri Expresses Nostalgia for the Scenery of Beiping; Today Departing from Shanghai to Manila, Flying Directly to the United States</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] City Council Speaker Pan, City Party Headquarters Chairman Fang, and Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission Standing Committee Member Xiao Jishan hosted a banquet for Siamese Elder Piri and his party at noon yesterday at Zhang's residence at No. 74 Shaoxing Road. In addition to Piri himself, the Siamese delegation members who attended included Mrs. Piri, Luan Suoshen, Yuecha Lachachai Shititiehua, Nai Witesiwayenuan, Zheng Guangsheng, Nai Su Guliang, and Nai Suomuji. Dozens of local officials and people from all walks of life attended, along with several female guests, gathered together in a lively atmosphere, chatting and laughing, and dispersed at around 2 p.m. Mr. Piri had a very good impression of Beiping and was especially nostalgic for the ancient sites and famous scenic spots of the former capital. He said that it was a pity that the time was too short to visit Tianjin.</p>
<p>Increase Sino-Siamese Relations</p>
<p>[Also Reported] When Siamese Elder Piri was interviewed by a reporter from this newspaper, he stated: He discussed issues related to increasing Sino-Siamese relations with Chairman Chiang several times in Beijing and firmly believes that there is a historical friendship between the two countries, which will definitely strengthen day by day in the future. The pro-Japanese regime should be responsible for the anti-Chinese incidents in Siam in the past. The current government has adopted effective measures to protect the interests of overseas Chinese, so their safety is not a problem. As for the issue of increasing cultural exchanges between China and Siam, I also exchanged views with the authorities of your country while in Beijing.</p>
<p>Diplomatic sources: There has been significant progress in Sino-Siamese relations recently. The reasons are: (1) Politically, Siam hopes that our country can provide support in the future when requesting to join the United Nations and negotiating with other major powers. (2) Economically, Siam is eager to develop its export industry. 70% of its annual rice production is exported abroad, and our country, with its geographical proximity, is the most ideal market. In addition, there are many other areas of mutual economic need. (3) Siamese newspapers are gradually reporting on China more accurately, and misunderstandings are gradually decreasing.</p>
<p>Piri and his party are scheduled to depart from Shanghai to Manila on a special plane of the U.S. Air Transport Command today, flying directly to the United States. Mr. Piri's trip to the United States is at the invitation of Washington. After arriving in the United States, he will be a White House consultant. Afterwards, he will definitely visit England first. If the territorial dispute between France and Siam can be resolved smoothly, Mr. Piri will conveniently visit Paris. According to unconfirmed reports, Mr. Piri may also travel to Moscow.</p>

<h3>National Flag Covers the Casket: Donner's Funeral Held Yesterday; Chairman and Mrs. Chiang Present a Chrysanthemum Cross</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] William Henry Donald, Chiang Kai-shek's personal advisor who devoted himself to China for forty years, was laid to rest peacefully yesterday at 3 p.m. in the International Cemetery of Hongqiao, amidst the silent prayers of Mrs. Chiang and his friends.</p>
<p>The funeral arrangements for Donald were entirely handled by the Lizi Society. After Donald passed away at the Hong'en Hospital at 1:15 a.m. the previous morning, he was immediately transported to the International Funeral Home on Jiaozhou Road, where he was made up by the funeral home. Starting at 9 a.m. yesterday, people from all walks of life went to pay their respects. The body lay quietly in a teak casket, covered with the national flag of the Blue Sky, White Sun, and Red Earth, revealing only the head and upper body. He was wearing a navy blue suit, a blue-gray shirt, a dark blue-gray striped tie, and a white handkerchief in his pocket. His expression was dignified, but because the makeup on his face was too pale and the lighting in the room was so dim, people who knew Mr. Donald felt as if they were seeing a wax statue of an old man sleeping under the yellow light!</p>
<p>The casket was placed in the center of the hall. Behind the casket, in the center, stood a cross composed of yellow and white chrysanthemums, presented by Chairman Chiang and Mrs. Chiang. A white ribbon was tied on it, with English words written on one side and "Eternal Remembrance of Mr. Donald, Respectfully Mourned by Chiang Kai-shek and Soong Mei-ling" written on the other side. On both sides of the cross, the Chinese national flag was placed on the right, and the Australian flag was placed on the left. On both sides of the casket and on the walls, yellow and white chrysanthemum wreaths were hung, and more than ten pots of yellow and white chrysanthemums were placed on the ground. A eulogy poem by Ye Gongchuo especially increased the mourners' grief. The poem reads: "You came when I was already ill, you left while I still exist. The vast calamity is difficult for people to reverse, your self-respect is honored in the literary world. Your words are as heavy as breaking gold, the strategies you presented left traces in history. Sighing and mourning is extremely late, what can comfort the nine springs?"</p>
<p>After 1 p.m., the people attending Mr. Donald's encoffining ceremony arrived one after another, and were led into the hall by the staff of the Lizi Society and Mr. Donald's friends to pay their last respects. Mrs. Chiang, supported by Kong Lingkan, accompanied by Ms. Kong Lingwei, arrived at the funeral home at 1:50 p.m. Mrs. Chiang had a sad expression on her face. She wore a black wool coat, a long black silk cheongsam, leather high-heeled shoes, black gloves, and carried a black leather bag. After entering the hall, she remained silent and sat quietly in the central seat of the first row facing Mr. Donald's body. Soon, Mayor Wu and his wife and Kong Xiangxi also arrived one after another.</p>
<p>Encoffining Ceremony</p>
<p>At exactly 2 p.m., the encoffining ceremony began. Six of Mr. Donald's friends who were prepared to carry the casket, Tian Boli, Chennault, Huang Renlin, Dr. Zheng Zumu, Qi Bomen, and Shi Beilei, stood on both sides of the casket. British priest Qu Weituo stood in front of the guests in the outer room, reciting a prayer. Everyone stood up and bowed their heads to pray for the deceased. The ceremony lasted for about twenty minutes. After the ceremony, Director-General Huang reported and asked the guests to pay their last respects to Mr. Donald's remains before leaving. Mr. Donald's remains were quietly hidden under the tightly closed coffin lid. The national flag and the gift from Chairman Chiang and Mrs. Chiang, the chrysanthemum cross, were still covered on the coffin lid.</p>
<p>Holding the Burial Ceremony</p>
<p>Mrs. Chiang and others stood outside the door waiting. Tian Boli and the other five people helped carry the casket onto the car. In the funeral procession, Reverend Qu led the way in a car, followed closely by the hearse, followed by the car of the pallbearers, and then by Mrs. Chiang and her entourage of more than ten vehicles, which drove to the International Cemetery of Hongqiao. The burial site had been carefully arranged in advance, and the surroundings of the grave were covered with green grass. After the casket was placed on the leather straps, it was slowly lowered. At that time, Reverend Qu continued to recite the burial prayer, and Mrs. Chiang and others also stood silently in front of the casket. At 2:45 p.m., the funeral ended. Director-General Huang thanked the guests on behalf of everyone. After everyone had presented more than twenty flower wreaths at the tomb, Mrs. Chiang returned to her residence.</p>
<p>Mr. Donald's encoffining and funeral yesterday were as simple as possible. However, the deep mourning emotions were not diminished because of this. Those who went to mourn included Gu Huijing, Wang Zhengting, Zhang Daofan, Bei Yu, Qian Dajun, Xuan Tiewu, and more than a hundred of Mr. Donald's Chinese and foreign friends. Yesterday, the police sent dozens of the most well-trained special police officers from the bureau, led by Inspector Yan Xianghu, to guard and take care of everything. In addition, Central Committee Member Zhang Daofan specially wrote an article to mourn Mr. Donald, ending with "Respectfully Mourned by Zhang Daofan, a Chinese friend who loved and respected him."</p>
<h3>Mrs. Chiang Postpones Return to Nanjing</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Mrs. Chiang came to Shanghai from Nanjing this time to visit Mr. Donald's illness. After Mr. Donald passed away, she presided over the funeral. Originally scheduled to return to Nanjing after Mr. Donald's burial was completed yesterday afternoon, she will stay in Shanghai for one or two days because Marshal Marshall's daughter, Mrs. Wyeth, will arrive in Shanghai on the morning of the 12th. After Mrs. Wyeth arrives, she will return to Nanjing with Mrs. Marshall and others.</p>

<h3>On the Shanghai-Minhang Road: Visiting the Puji Sanatorium – Housing Various Types of Mentally Ill Patients – Some Crying, Some Laughing, Some Cursing, Some Swearing</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper] The bus bumped along the Shanghai-Minhang Road towards the Puji Sanatorium. The reporters traveling in the same bus, initially complaining about the long distance and rough road, were silenced as the bus entered the gate of a red, multi-story building and stopped beneath a solemn statue of the Virgin Mary. Upon seeing the various kinds of mentally ill patients, their complaints were replaced by a strong sense of interest.</p>
<p>Greeting Through Iron Bars</p>
<p>It is unfortunate to fall ill, especially to suffer from mental illness. These patients are constantly immersed in the painful thoughts of their altered state, leading to various abnormal, ridiculous, and even frightening behaviors. Among the many patients we saw, the most interesting was a male patient who claimed to be a Bachelor of Arts graduate of Shanghai University's class of 1936. It was said that he suffered a concussion after being thrown from a rickshaw by a car, leading to a diagnosis of incurable epilepsy. During his periodic seizures, he would completely lose consciousness. However, when lucid, he would constantly demand to be discharged. Yesterday, as we passed his ward, he was sitting in the corridor reading a magazine, with several red mercurochrome-stained wounds on his forehead. Seeing us, he jumped up and, addressing someone (it was unclear who) through the iron bars, said in English mixed with Shanghainese: "Hey, don't you recognize me? 1936, MA, ××× is my classmate, and ×××, don't you know? I want to be discharged. Wang Xiaolai's Weixing Coal Mine needs my help, but the doctor won't let me go. Tell my brother to come and get me, okay?" Suddenly, he took a wooden stamp from his pocket and angrily said to the doctor, "I can stamp things myself, why does my brother have to come?" The doctor reassured him, "Because your brother is your guardian." Hearing this, he put the stamp back in his pocket, a helpless bitter smile forming on his lips. "German education… it's all German education!" he muttered.</p>
<p>Like a Matchmaker in Peking Opera</p>
<p>The scenes in the large ward were even more varied. The first thing we saw was an old woman with three small braids in her hair: one on top of her head and two on her temples, resembling a matchmaker in Peking Opera. She stood on a stool, gesticulating wildly and singing a tuneful little song. Nearby, a middle-aged female patient was loudly shouting and cursing. This woman was quite beautiful, with a strong build and naturally rosy cheeks. If not for being in this mental hospital, anyone would believe she was perfectly healthy. But now, she was constantly uttering incoherent vulgar slang. She protested to the nurse about the old woman singing songs, saying, "She can sing, but I'm six-oh-six... burned to the ground, the fire trucks left... we're traitors, come and catch us..."</p>
<p>This Group of Westernized Scoundrels</p>
<p>From the ward across the way came sobs. In the distance, several girls around ten years old were leaning on the windowsill. As we walked past, one of them began singing a folk song, "You are so strange!" And as we were leaving the ward, we heard the middle-aged woman's hysterical laughter: "You bunch of Westernized scoundrels!"</p>
<p>Many of the patients with milder conditions were strolling in the gardens, including a number of foreigners, all of whom appeared very quiet and polite. Some who were recovering were hardly distinguishable from ordinary people. Many of them were even "artists," with one studio's walls covered in landscape and figure paintings. Yesterday, Central Committee member Kong Xiangxi and Tang Xizhi, representative of Minister Peng of the Central Propaganda Department, were also visiting. One patient pointed at Kong and smiled, saying to a reporter, "Is that Kong Xiangxi? Hopefully, the hospital's funding will be sorted out."</p>
<p>The Superintendent Reports on the Situation</p>
<p>Due to time constraints, we were unable to examine things in further detail, and the hospital began a tea party and conversation. The Superintendent, Lu Yinggeng, first reported on the general situation of the hospital. Puji Sanatorium was founded in June of the 24th year of the Republic (1935) by the late philanthropist Mr. Lu Bohong in cooperation with the Catholic Church. Land was purchased at Beiqiao Township South, and fourteen new-style sanatorium buildings were constructed. Each building is surrounded by gardens and lawns, with excellent air and light, and all facilities are complete. The hospital has a total of 500 beds, with 326 patients currently. The fees are 30,000 yuan per day for first class, 20,000 yuan for second class, and 10,000 yuan for third class. Treatment includes drug injections and also focuses on analyzing the patient's psychology in order to guide them back to the right path.</p>
<p>From its establishment to the present, Puji Sanatorium has admitted a total of 2,411 patients, of whom 246 have died, 1,839 have been discharged, and 1,581 have fully recovered.</p>
<p>In the dim twilight, we boarded the bus again. The electric torch on the Virgin Mary statue gradually disappeared from view as we returned to the world of bright lights and extravagant entertainment.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Fine Arts Association: Zhang Daofan Sees His Teachers Off, Welcoming the Two Great Painters Qi Baishi and Pu Xinyu, Gu Chunfan Composes Poems to Add to the Festivities, Two Female Writers Kowtow to Become Disciples</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The Shanghai Fine Arts Association welcomed the renowned painting master Qi Baishi and the renowned painter Pu Xinyu at the Zhabu Road Cultural Hall at 3:00 PM yesterday. Over a thousand people attended, including Speaker Pan of the Municipal Council, Chairman Fang of the Municipal Party Headquarters, figures from various art circles, and individuals from all walks of life. Even the Siamese elder, Bili, joined the meeting. Zhang Daofan, recently in Shanghai to recuperate and newly accepted as a disciple of Qi Baishi, presided over the event and delivered a welcoming speech, stating: "Today, we welcome Mr. Qi and Mr. Pu. One is an artistic giant of eighty-six years old, whose artistic achievements are renowned both domestically and internationally. The other is also a great painter celebrated throughout China. This welcoming event was originally scheduled for the 12th, because that day is not only the birthday of the Father of the Nation but also an unprecedentedly auspicious day in Chinese history – the opening of the National Assembly for Constitution-Making. However, Mr. Qi is eager to return to Beijing, and Mr. Pu is a representative to the National Assembly and must travel to the capital tonight, so we moved the event forward to today."</p>
<p>Hoping to Enrich the Artistic Treasure Trove</p>
<p>"There is no need to say more about the character, knowledge, and everything else of the two gentlemen. What we admire most is Mr. Qi's spirit of researching art and engaging in art, which has remained consistent for decades, allowing him to become a giant in the art world. As for Mr. Qi's noble character and lofty integrity, they are even more worthy of our admiration. Mr. Pu, on the other hand, is a nobleman from the Qing dynasty, but even before the founding of the Republic, he looked down on aristocratic life and devoted himself to the study of literature and art. After the September 18th Incident, he repeatedly resisted the enemy's coercion and enticement. This shows that he has a clear understanding of the great Chinese nation and does not engage in activities that harm the nation. After the July 7th Incident, Mr. Pu remained secluded on Longevity Hill, and his poetry, calligraphy, and painting reached their peak. We hope that Mr. Qi will continue to create more paintings to enrich the artistic treasure trove. We hope that Mr. Pu will also help us and guide us more in the future." At this time, everyone in attendance stood up and applauded, expressing their welcome to Mr. Qi and Mr. Pu. Zhang Daofan's beloved daughter, Zhang Lilian, and Miss Wang Weiwei presented flowers.</p>
<p>Flowing Clouds and Water, Emerging from Nature</p>
<p>Zhang Bantao then delivered a thank-you speech on behalf of Mr. Qi Baishi and introduced the lives of Mr. Qi and Mr. Pu in the old capital during the period of the Japanese occupation, stating that Mr. Qi did not leave his house for eight years, and his residence was surrounded by barbed wire, like a prison. Mr. Pu did not descend from Longevity Hill for eight years. Mr. Pu Xinyu also delivered a speech, saying that he dared not accept the various praises and that upholding righteousness and remaining unyielding were the basic principles of being a person.</p>
<p>Finally, representatives of the guests, Chairman Fang and Speaker Pan, delivered speeches. Mr. Fang elaborated on the points of making life artistic, making society artistic, and completing the truth, goodness, and beauty of life. Speaker Pan praised Mr. Qi's works as being like flowing clouds and water, emerging from nature. He also expressed his respect for Mr. Pu's loyalty, self-preservation, and artistic achievements. He elaborated on Confucius's words, "Rest in the Dao, wander in the Arts."</p>
<p>After the speeches, Miss Lang Yuxiu performed songs, and the Technicolor film "Unsubmissive China" was screened to add to the festivities. The Guotai Film Company filmed news footage of the day's events.</p>
<p>[Another Report] At 6:00 PM last night, Zhang Daofan hosted a banquet at the "Literary Respite" on Tanggu Road near Luguan Road to see off Mr. Qi and Mr. Pu. Over a hundred dignitaries from all walks of life attended. During the banquet, Ms. Lei Peizhi, wife of Lang Jingshan, and female writer Zhao Qingge kowtowed to Qi Baishi to become his disciples. There were also various other entertainments. Director of the Bureau of Finance Gu Chunfan also composed two poems to present to the two contemporary painters. They are included below: "Master Baishi, the modern painting master, How few share his carefree spirit in seclusion, He idled his hands that could once record heroes, Painting only gourds and insects." Another poem: "Old Pu, your paintings were known of old, Returning after ten years of chaos, The mountains and valleys in your heart remain, You are not a prince, but a painting master." The guests and hosts dispersed joyfully after 10:00 PM.</p>
<h3>US Under Secretary of the Navy Flew to Qingdao for Inspection – Will Return to Shanghai and Head Back to the US</h3>
<p>US Under Secretary of the Navy Kenney and his entourage flew to Qingdao yesterday morning aboard a special plane with Admiral Kirk, commander of the US Navy's Seventh Fleet, for inspection. They will stay in Qingdao overnight and, if time permits, will return to Shanghai today before heading back to the United States. The purpose of their trip is to inspect the conditions of various US naval bases in the Pacific and to visit China. Due to the short timeframe, they may return to the US via the Philippines tomorrow.</p>
<h3>Government Agencies Occupying Enemy Property – Unable to Relocate, Auction Cancelled – Evicting Ordinary Citizens? Thirty-Nine Unit Residents Appeal Again</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] According to residents of the Chenghai Villa on Weihaiwei Road and residents of other enemy property houses who spoke to reporters, residents of enemy property houses can be roughly divided into the following five categories: (1) Those who have a lease contract that has not yet expired. These residents are protected by Article 425 of the Civil Code. (2) Those who have a wartime contract that expired during the war but has, in fact, become an indefinite continuing contract. They are also protected by Article 451 of the Civil Code. (3) Those who resided there before the victory and still do not have a contract but are also protected by Article 422 of the Civil Code. (4) Pre-war tenants who returned to their original residences after the victory. Based on all restoration circumstances, they naturally have the right to continue living there. (5) Public school teachers and staff who returned after the victory and veterans who contributed to the war effort. These people who contributed to the nation should naturally have the right to reside there.</p>
<p>The opinions of the residents of these enemy property houses can be roughly summarized into the following three points: (1) The authorities will cause public resentment by enriching the national treasury at the expense of the people being displaced. (2) Auctioning off houses and evicting current residents who enjoy lease rights is inconsistent with law, reason, and human sentiment. (3) The auction of enemy property houses used by various government agencies has been cancelled because they have nowhere to relocate. If government agencies have nowhere to move, where can ordinary citizens find housing? Therefore, we once again appeal to the authorities that the auction of enemy property houses should still retain the lease rights of the original residents.</p>
<h3>Children's Health Competition to Open Today – Free Physical Examinations and Corrective Treatments</h3>
<p>The Municipal Health Bureau has formulated implementation measures for a children's and youth health competition to promote the health of children and youth and has appointed Kong Xiangxi, Yan Huiqing, Pan Gongqing, and others as honorary chairpersons. Registration began on the 1st, and the participation of children has been quite enthusiastic. The purpose of this health competition is to conduct health examinations, correct deficiencies, and provide guidance on nutrition and healthy living over an extended period of time. If deficiencies are discovered during the examination, designated hospitals will provide free corrective treatments. Those who are malnourished will be given cod liver oil concentrate, and the extent of their health will be observed over a period of time. Experts will be hired to assess their grades. The association has scheduled physical examinations to begin on the 16th and will hold an opening ceremony at the Municipal Chamber of Commerce at 3:00 PM today.</p>
<h3>Exhibition of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Relics – More Than Two Hundred Items Collected</h3>
<p>The Municipal Museum will hold an exhibition of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's achievements and relics on the occasion of Dr. Sun's birthday and has collected a large number of valuable exhibits, totaling more than two hundred items.</p>
<h3>Naval Base Headquarters Officially Established in Shanghai Yesterday</h3>

<h3>The Rise and Fall of the Shanghai Opera Scene</h3>
<p>Special Report by Our Newspaper</p>
<p>Mei Lanfang and Yang Baosen have already taken the stage at the China Grand Theatre, while Cheng Yanqiu and Tan Fuying are about to perform at the Tianchan Theatre. The completeness of the cast in these two performances is rare in recent years. This time, the China Grand Theatre and the Tianchan Theatre are competing fiercely, creating a sensation, and the "Zhou Langs" of Shanghai (talent scouts or enthusiastic fans) are almost overwhelmed.</p>
<p>Recently, Peking Opera has been gradually declining. American movies flood the market, and low-class popular local operas such as "Diddly Bums" and Shanghai Opera have snatched away many audiences. Peking Opera can only use mechanical sets as its selling point. Even when performers come from the north, only "pi" (fighting scenes) and "fang" (spinning scenes) can draw a crowd. Judging from the disastrous ticket sales of Tan Fuying's performance at the Queen's Theatre this time, there is deep concern for the future of Peking Opera.</p>
<p>Why has Peking Opera created such a phenomenon? First, the fees for the actors are too high, which forces ticket prices to increase. In these years of soaring prices and difficult livelihoods, how many people can afford to spend 20,000 or 18,000 (currency unit) to see a play? Second, the quality of the plays does not suit the tastes of the audience. After eight years of war, the social situation has changed greatly. The audiences who used to sit elegantly in the theater boxes are now mostly without surplus funds to be patrons. Those who have taken their place are the middle and lower classes, who have money, but when they spend it, they flock to pornographic and low-level entertainment. Peking Opera, which has been prosperous for more than a hundred years, has been abandoned by them. In the past, Kunqu Opera was hit by Peking Opera because Kunqu Opera itself was too "classic." Now Peking Opera is declining again because of the low level of the audience.</p>
<p>This grand performance in two locations is indeed a grand event in the Shanghai theater scene, but looking ahead, is this a sign of revival? Or a last blaze of glory? Recalling the past glory, one cannot help but feel a bit emotional.</p>
<p>The Evolution of Tea Gardens, Stages, and Theaters</p>
<p>In Shanghai, the theaters were initially named after tea gardens, such as Yingchun, Danggui, and Chungui. Later, they competed to imitate Western-style architecture and changed their names to stages. Today, most Peking Opera theaters still use the name "stage." As for the so-called "theaters," they were initially places for showing movies, and gradually some of them changed to performing Peking Opera, still using the old name. Newly established theaters also adopted the name "theater." From tea gardens to stages to theaters, these are the three stages of the evolution of Shanghai's theaters.</p>
<p>Why were theaters called tea gardens? Indeed, the interior of the theaters at that time was somewhat similar to tea houses. Inside, there were many square tables, and when a guest arrived, a bowl of tea was a must, and there were also dishes of melon seeds, fruits, and snacks placed in front. But the intention of the guests was not to taste tea. It is said that most of the people in the old capital were "connoisseurs." They went to the theater to listen and drink, just like tasting tea in a tea house.</p>
<p>Another theory is that during the reign of Emperor Qianlong in the late Qing Dynasty, theaters in the old capital sprang up everywhere. The imperial family, nobles, and members of the Eight Banners sang and danced without any restraint. Emperor Gaozong ordered the closure of theaters, and the sound of singing and music ceased. Later, during the Empress Dowager's birthday celebrations, actors entered the palace to perform. From then on, the ban gradually eased, and singing and dancing were revived, but they did not dare to openly violate the imperial decree, so they changed the name to tea gardens. Shanghai also used this name, not calling them theaters.</p>
<p>Tea Garden-Style Theaters</p>
<p>Now, west of Guangdong Road and Shandong Road is commonly called "Mantingfang." The three characters "Mantingfang" are the name of the earliest Peking Opera theater. Mantingfang was opened in the fifth year of the Tongzhi reign (1866) between Baoshan Street and Ningsui Street, completely imitating the style of Beijing. After the opening of Mantingfang, business boomed. Liu Weizhong saw this and followed suit, establishing the Danggui Tea Garden on Baoshan Street, and later setting up a Southern Danggui branch at Xiaodongmen. In addition, there were Tianxian, Yingchun, Chungui, and others, all of which were tea garden-style theaters.</p>
<p>In the tea garden-style theaters, the center of the ground floor was lined with many square tables, each with six seats, which was the main hall. Behind the main hall and on both sides were side boxes. The upstairs was also divided into boxes, each seating a dozen people. The stage and the audience area were lit with gas lamps, which were not very bright. Later, gauze curtains were added, and when electric lights came out, gas lamps were gradually eliminated.</p>
<p>The construction of new-style stages began with the New Stage on Nine Acres of Land in the city. In the late Guangxu period, Xia Yueshan, Xia Yuerun, and others planned to build a new-style theater. At that time, the Governor-General of Liangjiang and the Shanghai Daotai also paid attention to the Chinese market, so the Zhenshi Company was organized, and the stage was located on Nine Acres of Land. The internal structure of the New Stage was both spacious and novel, and the layout was orderly, which was very different from the tea garden-style theaters. Unfortunately, before the opening performance could last for ten days, Empress Dowager Cixi and Emperor Guangxu passed away one after another. Due to the national mourning, the performances were suspended for twenty-seven days, which was a major blow. Later, it was taken over by Kaiming, and the Xia brothers starred in The Biography of Jigong. Initially, business was quite prosperous, but it did not last. After 1929, the land was redeveloped into city buildings, and there was no trace of the New Stage from then on.</p>
<p>The History of the Stage</p>
<p>After the New Stage was built, the Danggui Tea Garden was renovated, and other places also rebuilt new-style theaters one after another. The tea gardens were no longer visited. Among the current theaters, the architecture of the Great Stage is the newest, completed in 1935. The Tianchan Stage is the largest, accommodating more than 4,000 spectators. It was originally named the Shanghai Stage, but after Gu Zhuxuan took over, it was renamed. The previous Tianchan Stage was located at the Seven Heavens of the Wing On Company, with the main entrance on Jiujiang Road. As for the China Grand Theatre, where Mei Lanfang is currently performing, it was originally called the Samsung Stage. Later, due to disputes, it was taken over by the Gengxin Stage, which was previously opened in Zhabei, and renamed the Gengxin Stage. It was only in recent years that it was called the China Grand Theatre.</p>
<p>As for the theaters that were called "theaters," they initially showed movies, and later performed Peking Opera. Some even kept the same name. Like the Golden Grand Theatre, it was previously a third-rate movie theater, and after it changed to performing Peking Opera, it still used this name. At that time, other places used new scenery and new plays as their selling points, while the Golden Grand Theatre exclusively performed old plays, which was praised by the general "opera fans" in Shanghai. The Carlton was also a movie theater, which previously only occasionally performed singing and dancing, but its architecture was quite close to a stage. Later, Zhou Xinfang performed Peking Opera in that theater for a long time.</p>
<p>The Lyceum is the Best Opera Theater</p>
<p>The Lyceum, which has a purely Western flavor and only occasionally performs Peking Opera excerpts, is also worth mentioning. Because it is the most complete modern theater in Shanghai. The one at the corner of Elsie Road and Rue du Consulat is already the third location. In 1867, the Amateurs Dramatic Club, established by Westerners, built a new-style theater on Museum Road, which was a wooden building, unfortunately destroyed by fire. In 1872, it was rebuilt with bricks, and the performances continued until 1929. The building, which had been around for more than fifty years, was sold by the original owner of the Lyceum in 1929 for 175,000 taels, and a new one was built in the former French Concession, which is the current Lyceum. The new Lyceum opened on February 5, 1931. Although it only has more than 700 seats, the sight lines and sound waves have been studied, and the seats are spacious and comfortable, and the lobby is magnificent. The whole theater is clean and quiet, which is unique in Shanghai. Unfortunately, it mainly shows movies, but sometimes it is borrowed by drama groups. It is really the best opera theater.</p>
<p>Shanghai Opera Schools</p>
<p>Opera schools are the birthplace of actors, and formal training is the proper way for actors to start their careers. Like the Fuyuncheng in Beijing, a well-established opera school, Tan Fuying, Ma Lianliang, and others all trained at Fuyuncheng. Later, some were called schools, such as the China Opera School in Beijing and the Shanghai Drama School in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Fifty years ago, Shanghai had already established an opera school called "Tianhua Jin Xiao Jing Ban." It was founded by Gu Chongde from Tianjin, who originally made a living by selling horses. Because he failed in a lawsuit, he could not stand in Tianjin, so he came to Shanghai to seek a way out. At that time, Peking Opera was quite prosperous in Shanghai, so he found a city house in the Hujiazhai area, renovated it into a theater, and recruited a group of children to train. The students' stage names all began with the character "Sai," such as "Sai Changgeng," "Sai Yeling," "Sai Lü Bu," and "Sai Diaochan," specializing in fierce and tumbling acrobatics. Later, when they performed, they initially sold tickets for three jiao (currency unit). At that time, Wang Guifen was performing at Tianfu, also selling tickets for three jiao, so business was not good, and then it dropped to one jiao, but still no one came. At the same time, Gu Rongzong often abused the child actors. Many felt injustice in their hearts. One of them accidentally cut Gu's lower body with a dagger, causing his death. Gu's son knew his father's guilt and did not pursue the matter. Instead, he burned all the contracts of the child actors. From then on, this opera school also disbanded.</p>
<p>In 1939, the Shanghai Drama School was established, which was a very good opera school. In just a few years, it trained talents who had already gained some reputation, but it eventually disbanded due to unbearable burdens.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Drama School was initiated by amateur actor Yu Xiaogu and veteran actor Liu Songji, and was located next to the Old Dahua Ballroom on Avenue Foch. Chen Chengyin served as the principal, Yu Xiaogu served as the director of general affairs, and Guan Hongbin served as the director of academic affairs. More than 100 child actors were recruited and training began. In the beginning, the economy was very tight, so most of the faculty and staff were of a semi-voluntary nature. Because many of the students were children of professional actors and already knew how to sing at home, they felt very hopeful after half a year of hard work. The school then spent 30,000 (currency unit) to purchase costumes and props, and made its debut at the Golden Grand Theatre on October 12, 1940, which surprised all walks of life. After that, they performed at the Golden Grand Theatre every Wednesday and Saturday, using the income to supplement expenses.</p>
<p>After the opera school disbanded, these novice actors began to travel around, officially starting their stage life. Among them, Guan Zhengming, Wang Zhengkun, Gu Zhengqiu, Zhang Zhengfang, and others have made considerable progress in their art. However, Gu Zhengqiu assisted Tan Fuying in his performance at the Queen's Theatre, and the ticket sales were disastrous. This setback also served as an encouragement for her future.</p>

<h3>Boy Actors: In an Instant, Hats and Beards are Exchanged, Making it Difficult to Distinguish Between Male and Female</h3>
<p>A small troupe takes the stage, graceful and charming, selected early to enter the theater. A melody of light steps and thin silk, like wanting to lift the fairy skirt in the wind. Suddenly, a delicate voice sings a changing tune, a slanting hat and palace flower, pressing diagonally on the trembling hair. In an instant, hats and beards are exchanged, making it difficult to distinguish between male and female.</p>
<p>This song by a Song Dynasty poet praising female actors can be a portrayal of boy actors. Whether there were female actors in the Song Dynasty is not known in detail. But sixty or seventy years ago, there were no women in the opera scene. The so-called boy actors' plays began in Shanghai during the Tongzhi and Guangxu periods, and became a fashion for a time. Later, as women became more open-minded, female actors gradually increased. Now, there is a trend that a troupe cannot be formed without female roles.</p>
<p>It is said that during the Tongzhi and Guangxu periods, there was a famous clown in the north named Li Mao'er, who was good at comedic plays and paired with the female lead Xie Baolin. Their performances were always hilarious. In addition to comedic plays, Li Mao'er also played the square-hatted clown, which was full of charm. Later, he performed in Shanghai and won much praise. Although Li Mao'er was a famous clown, his salary was only thirty-odd (currency unit), and his life was quite difficult. Later, he thought of a way to make a living by gathering several poor women from his neighborhood, aged between eleven or twelve and sixteen or seventeen, and teaching them to act. Regardless of male, female, painted face, or clown, he taught them all alone. After a year of training, they actually became a female child actors' troupe. He used the two characters "Mao'er" from his own name as the name of the troupe, and performed in various places, which was very popular. Later, the name Mao'er Xi was changed to Mao'er Xi (both pronounced the same), which was actually a written error. Mao'er Xi in those years specialized in providing performances for the celebrations of wealthy gentry and merchants. Each performance consisted of four plays, with a remuneration of sixteen (currency unit), plus additional rewards. One play was requested, and another four (currency unit) were added. The plays performed were all civil plays involving three or more people, such as "San Niang Teaches Her Son," "The Emperor Playing with the Phoenix," "Wulongyuan," and "The Second Entry into the Palace." The costumes and props were rented temporarily, and the stage was also temporarily built. Later, as business became more prosperous and they were overwhelmed with requests, they purchased young actors and increased the repertoire, and thus the scale gradually took shape. The price for performances also increased from sixteen to twenty-eight (currency unit).</p>
<p>Finally, there was the establishment of female theaters, which were surprisingly prosperous. However, the intention of most people was to see the "old man" (a euphemism for seeing women). Currently, small theaters in Shanghai such as Xiaoguang, Changle, and Shidai mainly feature female actors, which has the flavor of boy actors' plays. However, there are also female roles in general large theaters. Female roles who can take on major roles are no weaker than male roles, and there is a trend of confrontation. This was something that Li Mao'er had not anticipated at the time.</p>
<h3>Famous Actors, Popular Actors, Trendy Actors: Veteran Actors Rely on Skill for a Living, New Artists Rely on Support to Make Money</h3>
<p>Actors are divided into famous actors, popular actors, and trendy actors. Although there is no clear "gulf" between them, their boundaries can be roughly seen.</p>
<p>Among the students who train in more than a hundred opera schools, only a few can be listed as famous actors upon graduation. It can be seen that famous actors are very rare. They must have a good voice, a good appearance, and must have gone through thousands of trials and reached the point of perfection before they are qualified to perform on stage. Mei Lanfang, who performs in "China," has had a great reputation for more than thirty years without declining. Even though he is over fifty years old, it is no easy task to still play the role of a graceful woman on stage. He is worthy of being the leader of contemporary actors and honored as a "doctor" without shame.</p>
<p>Since Shanghai opened to trade, the population has gradually increased, the market has become more prosperous, and the theater business has also flourished. Famous actors from the north have regarded Shanghai as a place to spend money and have come south to perform their skills. In the early years, Tan Xinpei, Sun Juxian, Wang Guifen, Yu Shuyan, Yang Yuelou, Wang Yaoqing, Wang Changlin, Gong Yunfu, Cheng Jixian, etc., all came to Shanghai to perform. Recently, Yang Baosen, Xiao Changhua, Jiang Miaoxiang, who performed with Mei, as well as Cheng Yanqiu, Tan Fuying, etc., who will soon perform at Tianchan, all have their own strengths, whether they are leading or supporting roles, and can be included in the ranks of famous actors.</p>
<p>Although Peking Opera originated in the north, famous actors are not necessarily from the north. Zhou Xinfang's dialogue does not get rid of the southern accent, but his appearance and expression are also commendable. Li Chunlai's martial arts skills were highly praised by Yang Xiaolou. The Guan Gong of Lao San Mazi and Wang Hongshou was jointly promoted by the north and south. Kunqu opera singer Yu Zhenfei, who went to sea as an amateur, is also one of the rare young actors today, elegant and unrestrained, seeming to be above Jiang Miaoxiang. These are all famous actors from the south.</p>
<p>Although famous actors have sweet voices, beautiful appearances, and highly skilled artistry, some have never become famous in their lives. The only surviving old servant Rui Debao in the south and the veteran actor Zhang Rongkui are both wandering and teaching opera for a living. Gui Junqing and Gao Qingkui also came to Shanghai to sing, but eventually died in depression. Fate! Fate!</p>
<p>Popular Actors</p>
<p>Popular actors refer to people who can enjoy great fame in the art world. Famous actors are not necessarily "popular," and popular actors are not all super-skilled. Someone said: "Veteran actors rely on skill for a living, new artists rely on support to make money." This is the annotation of famous actors and popular actors. In 1939, when Wang Yurong was singing at the Golden Grand Theatre, she brought out her teacher Wang Yaoqing, and the advertisement even used the words "Wang Yaoqing's old servant personally supports the stage" to appeal to the audience. Isn't this borrowing the name of the teacher to increase his own value?</p>
<p>Although popular actors do not have outstanding skills, they must have their strengths. They can use their strengths, so they can create a new style and new style. Ma Lianliang is listed as one of the four major beards. Watching his performances, his playful performance, his side-style appearance, and his improved costumes are purely using his strengths, saving effort and attracting audiences, killing two birds with one stone. This kind of popular actor is certainly not as good as famous actors in terms of "capital" and "skill," but the magic power of attracting audiences may be greater than that of famous actors.</p>
<p>The fate of popular actors who are not famous actors on the stage is often not lasting. For example, Mao Shilai, Qiu Shengrong, Gao Shenglin, etc., were also popular for a while. Although their artistic qualifications were still shallow, if they worked hard, it would not be difficult to join the ranks of famous actors. Unfortunately, they did not know how to cherish themselves, and the "red" color gradually turned "black." Gao Shenglin is now at the Golden Grand Theatre, singing beard students, which is quite appealing. It is still hoped that he will cherish himself.</p>
<p>Whether an actor "becomes popular" is entirely a matter of opportunity. For example, Jin Shaoshan, who was a painted-face actor, was just a basic actor who sang the opening play at the Old Common Stage in Shanghai. Because he played the Overlord in Mei Lanfang's Farewell My Concubine, he became popular in one performance. According to the old practice, the Overlord was played by a martial arts actor. At that time, the martial arts actor of Mei's troupe was Sun Yukun, and he should have played it. That day, Jin Shaoshan was singing The Assassination of King Liao on stage, and the person in charge of the play asked Mei Laolian: "Who will sing the Overlord in Farewell My Concubine tomorrow?" Mei Laolian heard the Huang Zhong Dalu (the grand and resonant music) sound on the stage and asked, "Who is singing on the stage?" The person in charge of the play replied, "It is Jin Xiushan's son, Jin Shaoshan." Mei Lanfang had a flash of inspiration and called Jin Shaoshan to play the Overlord. In the previous scene, Mei Lanfang still paired with Sun Yukun in a Changbanpo to comfort him. He was really thoughtful.</p>
<p>Trendy Actors</p>
<p>As for the so-called trendy actors, they completely use opportunism to cater to the audience. When Tong Zhiling performed at the "Queen," she was more popular than Tan Fuying. This is the magic of her signature "splitting" and "spinning." The Common Stage advertised heavily in the newspaper, and it was full every night. This kind of appeal to pornography is the most common practice of trendy actors. Another example is Li Wanchun, who has been jailed. Li Shaochun, who is currently performing at Tianchan, is both literary and martial arts, and he sings without acting, which shows that he is versatile, but in fact he is also a trendy actor. Recalling when Li Wanchun first came south with Mei Lanfang, he was still a fifteen or sixteen-year-old child, and he was already very popular. He and Lan Yuechun performed a play of Two Generals, which was more popular than Yang Xiaolou's Lianhuan Tao. Judging from his acting skills, he can be called a good one, especially since he rarely performed the same play a second time in more than a month, so although the fire was not as good, he could be included in the ranks of famous actors. But soon he acted in civil plays, changed from a famous actor and popular actor to a trendy actor. After the victory, he was imprisoned. In his life, he not only played characters on the stage, but also played various different actors, which is also a strength.</p>
<p>Mei Lanfang: Assassinating the Tiger</p>
<h3>The Masters of Shanghai: Qin Player Chen A'jin, Drummer Zhao Songshou</h3>
<p>In Peking Opera, the accompanying instruments, the huqin and the drum, are the most important. The qin players and drummers in the opera world often enjoy great fame. For example, the qin of Mei Yutian and Sun Zuochen, and the drums of Li Wu and Liu Shun are all extraordinary. In the Shanghai scene, there were also two people in the past, qin player Chen A'jin and drummer Zhao Songshou, who can be called the outstanding figures of the time.</p>
<p>One year, Wang Guifen came to Shanghai, and his qin player was unable to play due to illness, so the troupe leader replaced him with A'jin. However, Gui himself believed that his singing style could not be properly supported by others, so he had a contemptuous attitude towards A'jin. After going on stage, when singing to the middle, the strings of the qin suddenly broke. Gui Fen could not help but feel anxious, and looked at A'jin frequently with displeasure. Everyone on stage and the staff backstage were sweating for A'jin, but A'jin was unusually calm, as if nothing had happened, and actually played a single string to finish the song. After the matter, A'jin apologized to Gui Fen, and Wang quickly smiled and welcomed him, saying: "Today I know how high your qin skills are, and your reputation is well-deserved."</p>
<p>Drummer Zhao Songshou was the grandfather of the famous dan Zhao Junyu. He was proficient in the "six scenes" and was good at compiling new plays. He was not only famous in the world for his drum skills. When Mei Yutian came south with Lao Tan, he was especially humble and eager to learn, fearing that there were also famous players in the south. He inquired among the artists in the troupe and found Zhao's name, so he personally visited him three times. The two met and became friends. Whenever Yutian asked, he taught him wholeheartedly. Zhao drew diagrams of all the gongs and drums and the names of the tunes with colored pens and added annotations. When he was at home, he held a pen in one hand and buried himself in writing, as if he were a great writer.</p>
<p>Praising Actors</p>
<p>The scholars praised the actors, and the articles published in the newspapers from the past were often like a raging fire. Not to mention anything else, taking Mei Lanfang as an example, try reading Zhang Jizi's Nine Records, and there are quite a few letters written to him. Zhang Jizhi also had a "Post-Luoshen Fu," which was also written for Mei Lanfang, saying something like "The divine light flutters on the Yue female, and the aftersound lingers on the Han E," which was better than his Golden Hall Strategy. Zhu Guwei and Kuang Zhoufeng watched Mei's play together. The play "Cai Ying Pei" was being performed on stage, and the two of them linked up sentences under the stage, with the words "I hate not to make myself a beggar, Tianchan is only a short distance away, but it is at the end of the world. It is a pity that you and I are not as good as him." The last sentence was "I have no choice but to go home." It can be said that they were extremely infatuated.</p>
<p>There was a period in the late Qing Dynasty and early Republic of China when Feng Chunhang and Jia Biyun were praised. There are still many poems left in the Nanshe Congkan.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Actors' Organizations</h3>
<p>The Jingzhong Temple is an actors' organization in Beijing. The head of the temple is a banner, and all of them are served by first-class figures in the opera world, such as Cheng Changgeng and Yang Yuelou. Not only are their acting skills superior, but also for the opera industry away from home, searching thousands of miles away, with no relatives to look to. Xia's imitated the Jingzhong Temple in Beijing and prepared to create a guild.</p>
<p>At that time, the organization of southern actors was limited to Kun classes, and the Liyuan Guild of Kun class actors was in Suzhou. The Liyuan organizations in Shanghai can be regarded as the first of their kind. The Liyuan Guild was purely a trade organization of Peking Opera actors, but there were also a few Kun class actors such as Zhou Fenglin and Qiu Ruiqing who participated, because the Kun class was declining at that time, and there were few actors, so they had to join the Peking Opera class.</p>
<p>The Liyuan Guild is a Blessed Place for Actors</p>
<p>The Liyuan Guild was near the West Wood Bridge in the city, which was a two-entry bungalow, with a shrine to the Patriarch. On the first and fifteenth days of each month, the actors had to come to offer incense. They usually entered and exited through the side door on the east side, but on the birthday of the Patriarch, the main gate was opened wide, which was a grand occasion.</p>
<p>After the revolution, the Liyuan Guild was changed to the Actors' Federation, because the federation was very popular at that time. For every industry, there was a federation, and the Liyuan Guild was also changed to this name. The chairman was Pan Yueqiao. At that time, Pan had quite revolutionary ideas. During the Second Revolution, he participated in his plan and stored military supplies in the Federation. When the Jiangxi-Ningbo uprising occurred, Pan fled to Hubei and relied on Li Yuanhong to avoid disaster. The Actors' Federation was dissolved invisibly due to the hostility of the officialdom. It was not until the Yunnan uprising and the establishment of the Protectorate Government that the Actors' Federation raised its head again and re-elected Xia Yuerun as chairman.</p>
<p>This only organization of the Shanghai Liyuan industry has undergone many twists and turns before becoming the "blessed land" of today's actors. The interior has various public welfare undertakings such as righteous schools, public cemeteries, widow's rations, poor old age rations, apartments, and funerals, with considerable monthly expenditures.</p>
<p>Zhenling Elementary School, an Righteous School for the Liyuan</p>
<p>Zhenling Elementary School is an righteous school for the Liyuan, initiated by Pan Yueqiao and Xia Yuerun. The earliest principal was Ouyang Xu from Wu, who was later replaced by Sun Yusheng, who created a few talents. Later, the guild hired veteran actors to teach a group of poor and destitute children, so that they could learn art to make a living in the future, which was indeed an opera school.</p>
<p>Under the keen management of Pan and Xia, the Shanghai Liyuan industry organization gradually made progress. For the placement of unemployed colleagues, the relief of disabled and old men, and the resolution of disputes among colleagues, the two did not tire of the trivial matters, worked hard and complained, and benefited the opera industry greatly. Later, Qilin Tong, Lin Shusen, etc., also served as chairmen successively, carrying on their legacy.</p>

<h3>The Evolution of the Yarn Allocation System: Practical Amounts and Allotments Cannot Be Reconciled; Re-allocation Work Also Feels Overwhelmingly Difficult</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Since the restoration, the yarn and cloth market has been very turbulent. Prices were still sluggish this spring. Since summer and autumn, it has begun to run rampant, with yarn prices almost rising in a straight line, while cloth prices have changed more. Even in the last four weeks, yarn prices have remained firm and high, but the factory prices of cloth are not enough to cover costs. Last Thursday, at the cloth price review meeting convened by the Social Affairs Bureau, the cost and market price were compared, and the former was still lower than the latter. Five or six days ago, the textile factories complaining were everywhere. Because although cloth sales were slow, it was not convenient for factories to stop work. Cotton yarn was not continuously supplied, so they had to purchase it from yarn factories. And the selling price of yarn factories was not as flexible to cut as cloth factories. In recent days, bankruptcies of cloth and yarn firms have been heard frequently. On the one hand, cloth factories have to bear high-interest loans, and at the same time, they often sell cloth at prices that do not cover costs in order to turn over capital, and those with hollow bottom lines are increasing daily. People in the industry often use the term "leveling off" to describe the end of a factory or firm. There will be many "leveling off" this winter. In view of the seriousness of the crisis, cloth factories and other cotton yarn replica industries have launched a campaign since spring to stabilize yarn prices and mutually protect legal profits.</p>
<p>The Start of Joint Allocation On August 30th, under the auspices of Minister Wang of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, the Textile Industry Management Committee finally ordered the State-run Textile Construction Company and private yarn factories to handle joint allocation. It was agreed to allocate 30,000 bales of yarn per month, with the State-run contributing one-third and the private contributing two-thirds. In the one month of September, it was superficially maintained. However, the State-run still listed prices at the Textile Construction Company, and large and small factories often had no time to allocate based on different grades. The private sector's allocation methods gradually aroused accusations from all sides. Although it was forcibly allocated according to the original method in October, the black market rose daily, making it increasingly difficult for practical factories and normal yarn firms to receive their allocations. How much of the originally planned 30,000 bales per month actually reached practical factories? Both the allocating and receiving parties had no way to specify the exact numbers. Moreover, according to the allocation method of the Yarn Factory Association, purchase orders were first received, and prices were only announced in the evening. Purchasers had no way of knowing the prices in advance, and could not cancel their orders after the prices were announced. Even the listed price was the listed price, and the selling price was the selling price. Yarn users were burned out. Those with foresight in the yarn factory industry never failed to want to correct this, but with myriad threads, it has been unresolved for a long time.</p>
<p>Improvements in Allocation In late October, yarn and cloth rose even more. Dong Yunjhang, the director of the Textile Management Committee, felt quite troubled. Therefore, he made representations to higher-level agencies, and Mayor Wu concurrently assumed the position. At the beginning of his tenure, Mayor Wu launched a change in the allocation mechanism. He ordered the industry associations of replica industries such as dyeing, weaving, knitting, underwear, towel blankets, handkerchief weaving, and handmade cotton weaving to handle the allocation matters themselves. Each period, the Yarn Factory Association, namely the Sixth District Cotton Spinning Industry Association, would prepare a form to allocate yarn, which would be handed over to the Cotton Yarn Replica Industry Association allocation committee, jointly formed by the various replica industry associations, to supervise the respective associations to allocate according to the register they had submitted to the Textile Management Committee. Thus, the actual work of allocation was added to the shoulders of the re-allocation committees formed by the receiving factories. This can be said to be a major change in the allocation mechanism. What the results are remain to be proven by facts. However, there is a common belief on all sides that it is an improvement. Even the yarn factories feel interested in this. The Textile Construction authorities, in particular, are deeply supportive, as it may reduce misunderstandings.</p>
<p>Difficulties of the Re-allocation Committee In terms of the re-allocation committee, logically speaking, they should be satisfied. However, those familiar with the details say that they also feel very difficult. One is that the responsibility came suddenly. Preparations were insufficient, and fair allocation was not easy. In the past two weeks, two allocations have been made, and the headquarters of the re-allocation committee and the various constituent associations have done their best to cope with this matter. Still, it is difficult to feel at ease. They feel helpless and uneasy about those who failed to declare or did not participate in the allocation. Small factories that used to rely on squeezing Textile Construction yarn for their business are now unable to benefit, as the re-allocation committee measures based on the amount of practical use. Large factories still say it is not enough, as the Textile Management Committee only allocates 60% of their requested ammounts. From the next allocation onwards, a certain amount will be allocated within the original allocation quota to factories that have filed supplementary declarations. However, with too few resources and too many claimants, it will become even more inadequate. The second is that the source of yarn comes from yarn factories, and the matching of counts and the delivery of warehouse warrants are said to be difficult to describe in a few words. If sincere understanding cannot be obtained, it is inevitable that there will be other changes.</p>
<p>The New Method This Time Today (11th) is the day of the third allocation of the third period. The third period refers to the first period of September. The total amount is still 6,000 bales plus some remainder. The Textile Management Committee has already sent a document to the replica industry the night before. The authorities intend to allocate four times a month, not dividing it by weeks. The second time was accidentally chosen to be every Monday. If it remains unchanged, it will cause a month to exceed four times. Therefore, the following allocations will be on the 21st of this month and December 1st. The authorities consulted with the re-allocation committee on this matter in advance and they agreed. This is the first change in the method. The allocation quota remains the original number, but factories that have filed supplementary declarations will also receive allocations. Then the allocation quota for the original households will be further reduced. The amounts that supplementally declaring households receive will still be unsatisfactory. This matter has been agreed to by the Textile Management Committee after consultation with the re-allocation committee, and it is also an unavoidable expedient measure. This is the second change in the method. The qualifications and usage standards of each factory receiving the original allocation and the supplementary declaration have been reviewed again and reduced significantly. It is expected that some supplementally declared applicants will still not be able to receive allocations, and some original allocation factories will have their standards lowered. This is also something that the re-allocation committee has already reported to and followed the instructions of the Textile Management Committee to handle strictly. This is the third change in the method.</p>
<p>Further Improvements Needed in the Future According to news from the Textile Management Committee and the re-allocation committee, this is still a temporary expedient measure. There should be more practical improvements in December. According to the data from the re-allocation committee, the allocation amount will be increased by one-third. Those who do not directly replicate finished products in this city will be thoroughly reorganized. And the amount of practical use for each factory will be closer to reality. According to qualified people, it is necessary for yarn factories to cooperate in order for things to work out.</p>
<h3>Interview with the Chairman of the Yarn Industry Association: The Impact of Yarn Management Policies</h3>
<p>According to Tang Zhiliang, the chairman of the Yarn Industry Association, in an interview with reporters, regarding the black market for cotton yarn, the Textile Management Committee has adopted a coercive policy, so although prices have been reduced, they have not been completely eliminated. Manufacturers and intermediaries have all accepted Mayor Wu's four measures, but the other party's method of refunding or compensating for differences at a price of 1.75 million per bale is that the Textile Management Committee's opinion is that manufacturers should directly compensate the people holding warehouse warrants, but according to the opinion of merchants, it should be compensated to the person named on the warehouse warrant, because the manufacturer sells the warehouse warrant to the person named on it (the intermediary), and the person named on it then sells it to the person holding the warrant, who may be a user or an intermediary. For example, when the black market yarn price is 2.2 million, the person named on the warehouse warrant purchases a warehouse warrant from the manufacturer, but when the person named on it then sells it to the person holding the warrant, the black market price changes again, either rising or falling. It is actually unfair and unreasonable for the person holding the warrant to directly return 350,000 to the manufacturer at the price of 1.75 million. In fact, according to commercial custom, once a transaction is completed, the gains and losses are not related to each other. At most, the current loss is too great, and both parties agree to find a way to make up for it in the price of the next transaction, but the price of the previous transaction can never be changed. Therefore, although refunding or compensating for differences is beneficial to this industry, it will inevitably affect commercial customs and merchant credit. Therefore, since this method has been implemented, it has been difficult for intermediaries to purchase spot goods. Those who purchase them are all two-week futures. Calculating the current high-interest two-week interest rate, it has already increased to 1.89 million. I have talked to Mayor Wu about this matter, and Mayor Wu believes that he can order manufacturers to only sell spot goods. If they sell futures, the interest should be deducted at a rate of 15% every two weeks. However, if this is done, manufacturers can refuse to sell, making it even more difficult for intermediaries to buy cotton yarn, which is by no means a solution. Currently, manufacturers are planning to transport it to other places to find another way out. If this continues, yarn prices in other ports may fall, while the yarn shortage in this city will become even more serious.</p>
<h3>Qian Dui Industry: Engaging in Deposit Business; Planning to Convert All to Banks</h3>
<p>Since the government stipulated the price of US dollars, the transaction has been dull in the Qian Dui industry in this city. The industry had previously submitted a request to the Central Bank to allow the restoration of pre-war small industrial and commercial deposit business, and requested eight points: (1) Small industrial and commercial deposits are limited to the 185 registered Qian Dui firms; (2) To prevent peers from replacing them, it is not allowed to change owners; (3) Imitate the Qian industry system, so that the competent authority can check; (4) Hand over 20% of deposits to the Central Bank; (5) All Qian Dui stores should be changed to banks; (6) Previous licenses continue to be effective; (7) Stipulate the minimum capital amount for each store; (8) Imitate the Hangzhou Qian Dui industry method, and also engage in currency exchange. According to Wang Yuncheng, the chairman of the Qian Dui industry, the above eight articles have been personally approved by the president of the Central Bank.</p>
<h3>Joint Allocation Association: Cotton Yarn Conversion Method</h3>
<p>The Joint Cotton Yarn Allocation Association sells cotton yarn with 20 counts as the standard, but the counts sold by each factory are not all standard yarn. For example, in this period, there are only 3,375 bales of 20-count yarn, and there are various counts of other counts. As for the conversion method, according to the person in charge of the association: it is based on the actual number of spindles opened by each factory in July, carefully reviewed, and the conversion method is stipulated. The method is as follows:</p>
<p>10 counts 187.5% 16 counts 125%</p>
<p>20 counts 100% 32 counts 75%</p>
<p>42 counts 60%</p>
<p>The above conversion numbers are based on 20-count yarn as a percentage. Assuming that the yarn factory should allocate 100 bales of 20-count yarn in this period, the numbers are increased or decreased depending on whether 16-count or 32-count yarn is being converted. That is, 125 bales of 16-count yarn and 75 bales of 32-count yarn should be allocated.</p>
<h3>UNRRA's Supply of Cattle and Sheep: The Plan Has Not Been Abandoned; The Quantity Has Been Slightly Reduced</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The UNRRA's plan to supply cattle and sheep to our country was cancelled before due to the difficulty of purchasing them. According to reliable information from relevant parties, the original plan has not been abandoned, but the funding has been reduced from the original US$5 million to between US$600,000 and US$1 million. In December of this year, it is hoped that 400 frozen Friesian dairy cows will be transported to our country. UNRRA originally planned to supply 800 cattle to our country from Australia, but it has now been changed to supply 400 cattle, and the other 400 will be offset by 1,000 sheep. In addition to this, UNRRA plans to provide 1,000 water buffaloes. After these livestock are transported to our country in the future, the water buffaloes will be sold, and the dairy cows and sheep will be allocated to the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry.</p>
<h3>Adulteration Discovered in Grain Allocation: The Company Investigates the Truth</h3>
<p>The discovery of adulteration in the first phase of rationed sugar in this city has attracted considerable attention from the public. According to the person in charge of the company who spoke to reporters, the first batch of rationed sugar in this phase totaled 7,962 bags of medium-grade sugar. The Nantucket Goods Industry Association of this city separately sent personnel to the second wharf and the fifth wharf of the China Merchants Bureau to ship the goods, and the person in charge of the shipment from the association took samples from each bag before shipping them out of the warehouse. At that time, they were all pure Taiwan sugar. After the rationed sugar was shipped out of the warehouse, the adulteration occurred. The company believes that it is very strange and is now thoroughly investigating the truth to clarify the responsibility.</p>
<h3>Water Heating Pipes: Many Demolished, Few Arriving; Very Few Are Prepared to Install Them</h3>
<p>(Our Newspaper's Report) Winter is approaching in the blink of an eye, but the market conditions for water heating pipes have not improved. According to people in the hardware industry, during the enemy and puppet period, all the water heating equipment in major buildings, apartments, hotels, etc. in this city was almost completely demolished. However, the price of coal is surprisingly high, and the installation price of water heating equipment is also not cheap. On the industry side, there is also a shortage of goods. Therefore, there are almost no people who have started to restore the installation. After the victory, only Shenchang and Bu Neimen foreign firms, etc., have installed a small amount of water heating pipes from abroad. The original water heating seats and stoves have not been shipped. According to reports, the market price of half-inch diameter water heating pipes once reached 3,000 yuan per foot when there was a shortage of goods. The recent market price is 20,000 yuan per foot. A one-inch diameter pipe is 2,600 yuan per foot. The largest six-inch diameter water heating pipe is 20,000 yuan per foot. Among these, small-diameter pipes are relatively popular. The original water heating seats are priced based on the size of each piece of area. Ordinary water heating seats have an area of ​​between three square feet and five square feet. The wholesale price of each square foot is about one US dollar. The market price is about two US dollars per square foot. It is estimated that an ordinary two-story Western-style house with complete water heating equipment, including water heating pipes, water heating seats, and stoves, etc., requires about 30 million yuan. At such a high price, even the Western-style house class will probably be discouraged.</p>
<h3>Redemption of Four Types of Government Bonds: Lottery to Be Drawn in Shanghai Today</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Finance has decided to hold a public bond lottery for the redemption of the following four types of government bonds at 9:00 a.m. today (11th) at the Shanghai Office of the Public Debt Department of the Ministry of Finance, located on the fourth floor of the Central Trust Bureau at 74 Renji Road: the 25th year of the Republic of China Unified Government Bond Type D Bonds, the 28th year of the Republic of China Military Supplies Government Bond Phase 1 Bonds, the 30th year of the Republic of China Military Supplies Government Bond Phase 2 Bonds, and the 32nd year of the Republic of China Allied Victory Government Bonds. The Ministry has already sent separate letters to relevant agencies, and personnel will be sent to the venue to supervise and execute the lottery at that time, and people from all walks of life are welcome to visit. It is reported that once the above government bonds are drawn, the ministry will redeem the principal within a limited time. If you hold the bond documents, you can go to the designated bank to collect them within the limited time, and it will be resolved with the national treasury.</p>
<h3>The Voice of the Flour Industry: Daily Trading Is Limited; Profits Are Too Thin to Cover Expenses</h3>
<p>In the flour industry, in addition to the manufacturers, there are also flour dealers, which are divided into wholesale and retail industries. After the wholesalers obtain the flour from the flour factories, a small part is resold to retailers for retail sales, and the majority is sold to various gangs from the north and south. Because Shanghai is a major production area for flour, before the war, the total daily flour production of each flour factory in Shanghai was about 100,000 bags, so the business of wholesalers was quite developed. Moreover, most of the wholesalers are brokers of the flour exchange, and they also buy and sell futures on behalf of customers, so their business is even more prosperous.</p>
<p>After the outbreak of the August 13th Shanghai War, the flour exchange stopped operating. Futures trading could not be carried out, but spot goods could still be traded as usual. Later, as the war zone gradually expanded, the business was inevitably affected, but it was not very depressed. Until the outbreak of the Pacific War, the entire Shanghai fell into the hands of the enemy, and all kinds of important materials were put under control. Flour is the main food, and of course it was strictly controlled, so it was impossible to trade freely, and the business of wholesalers was stagnated. Retailers had to sell rationed flour to struggle to maintain their lives.</p>
<p>After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, the flour dealers all had great hopes, regrouped, and dreamed of the pre-war business, and announced their resumption of business one after another. The Flour Bran Commercial Industry Association was also organized. There are more than 300 members who have joined. Among them, wholesalers account for about one-quarter, and retailers account for three-quarters, but the products of the flour factories in Shanghai are not made by buying wheat themselves, but are commissioned by the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) to produce them, and they directly flow to the people without going through the hands of flour merchants at all. Fortunately, at this time, the flour merchants transported some miscellaneous brand flour from Wuxi, Suzhou, and other places to Shanghai for sale. When wheat was launched this year, in addition to producing relief flour for the UNRRA, the flour factories also purchased wheat to produce and sell flour. The harvest of wheat was still good this year, so the flour price was still stable in May and June. Although the price has inevitably continued to rise, other prices have risen sharply, and compared to the general rise of prices, the price of flour was no exception. However, it is not enough for our country's flour to rely solely on domestic wheat for manufacturing. Before the war, every autumn, a large number of foreign wheat imports were relied upon to supplement it, so after a few months, the amount of wheat exported gradually decreased, and the price gradually increased. Therefore, the flour price also rose step by step. In view of the people's food, the authorities restricted the retail price of flour from August 19th, and each bag should not exceed 14,300 yuan. Later, it was slightly increased to 14,700 yuan, and each flour factory was ordered to supply 9,000 bags of retail flour to the city every day. Unfortunately, at that time, only the export of flour was prohibited, and wheat could still be exported. As a result, the wheat reserves were depleted day by day, and the price of good wheat rose to nearly 40,000 yuan per load, while the 9,000 bags distributed by each factory every day could not be fully supplied, and Sunday was also a day of suspension of distribution, so supply could not meet demand, and they had to be supplemented by sales from other ports. And because the price of wheat was rising every day in other ports, the price of flour also rose, so the cost of transporting it to Shanghai alone required more than 18,000 yuan per bag. The purpose of merchants' transportation and sales is to make a profit, and the current interest rate is also ridiculously high, so everything is passed on to the buyers, and this has created the so-called black market.</p>
<p>Now, the authorities are also aware of the shortage of wheat reserves and have allowed manufacturers to temporarily increase the flour price to 20,000 yuan per bag, plus 300 yuan for transportation, and 200 yuan for profit, and the retail price per bag is 20,500 yuan. Each flour factory must maintain a daily distribution of 12,000 bags, and the export of wheat is also prohibited. The association will designate more than 100 retail stores to distribute this allocated flour, which can only be sold to merchants who manufacture various products with flour, such as bread, biscuits, noodles, flatbread, fried dough sticks, and various snack shops and steamed bun shops, etc., and they can all purchase flour with certificates. The profits obtained are evenly distributed among the 300 members. In addition, flour transported from other ports can be traded freely, but the price per bag must not exceed 20,500 yuan. As a result, the black market has disappeared.</p>
<p>But, what about flour dealers? There are now more than 300 members in the same industry. Every day, 12,000 bags (according to the recent number of flour bags from various industries, the average is 6,000 to 7,000 bags), the profit per bag of flour is 200 yuan, and they have to pay 100 yuan per bag to the designated retail dealers who distribute the flour. The actual amount they receive is only 100 yuan per bag. Even with 12,000 bags, a total of 1.2 million yuan, and an average distribution of 300 households, they only receive 4,000 yuan per day. Excluding four days without flour distribution on Sundays each month, there are only 26 days, and each household receives more than 100,000 yuan per month. Now, there are more than a dozen partners in large flour shops, and two or three in small shops. What are they going to do with a mere 100,000 yuan?</p>
<p>According to the above, then the more than 100 designated retail stores that distribute flour do not have an additional subsidy of 100 yuan per bag? However, they need to prepay for the distribution of flour. The interest rate is so high now, at least 15%, and they borrow money to prepay. If they pay for the goods today and pick them up, and sell them all tomorrow, it won't be a waste of effort. However, in fact, after two or three days, they still have a small amount of flour left, and the retailers cannot sell the flour to others, so they have to secretly pay the interest.</p>
<p>Therefore, flour merchants strongly hope that the authorities will adjust the stipulated profits and consider improving the current distribution methods.</p>
<h3>Accounting Issues for Last Year's Profit Tax</h3>
<p>— Gan Yunshou</p>
<p>After several consultations between the tax authorities and the persons in charge of the chamber of commerce on the simplified collection of profit tax in the 34th year, it has been decided to collect it based on the net profit concluded last year, plus 50%. Standing from the perspective of tax law and tax theory, we certainly cannot think it is reasonable, but in order to suit the tax revenue budget, the authorities have no choice but to implement it regardless of the law. However, looking back, because the accounts of industrial and commercial institutions have been long overdue last year, the net profit has already been distributed. The payment of this tax will inevitably cause many questions in the account books. Based on what I have seen, I will briefly discuss it below for reference by various industries:</p>
<p>After checking, most of the net profits of various industries in the 34th year have been distributed. Before the distribution, there was occasional legal provision for tax payments, but it would never exceed the net profit of that year. Now, the payment of taxes depends on the situation of each industry, and the accounting treatment will be different. Three situations are listed below:</p>
<p>The first situation – that is, if each industry's account lists items such as public reserve or rolling surplus, and the amount exceeds the tax amount for that year, then the amount of public reserve surplus can be offset by the tax amount due. The debit and credit entries are a debit to public reserve or rolling surplus and a credit to tax payable. Assuming that a company obtained a net profit of 1 million yuan in the 34th year, and the tax payable for that year was 1.5 million yuan. However, all the net profits have been fully distributed, and its account lists 400,000 for tax payable and 1.2 million for public reserve. At this time, the tax payable is still short of 1.1 million yuan, and 1.1 million yuan should be debited from the public reserve and 1.1 million yuan credited to the tax payable.</p>
<p>The second situation – although the account shows that there is a public reserve rolling surplus, it cannot offset the tax payable for that year. This difference can be transferred to the prior period profit and loss adjustment number, or the donation and tax item, listed as the loss of the 35th year, or transferred to the temporary payment item, to be written off when there is a surplus in the future. If the public reserve of a company mentioned above is only 500,000 yuan, and it is not enough to offset the tax payable, which is short of 600,000 yuan, then the insufficient amount can be debited into the prior period profit and loss adjustment number, or the donation and tax or temporary payment item.</p>
<p>The third situation – the amount of public reserve or rolling surplus listed on the account is very small, or even there is no listing of public reserve surplus or tax payable. In my opinion, the net profit and capital of that year should be calculated to calculate the legally tax payable amount, and debited into the capital owner's current account, or the tax receivable item, which is responsible for payment by the capital owner or shareholder. Since the net profit of that year has been fully distributed by the shareholders, and no consideration is given to making provisions for retaining the enterprise, the shareholders should be recovered. As for the difference from the tax bureau's regulations, it can still be debited into the prior period profit and loss adjustment number, or the donation and tax, or temporary payment item. For example, if the tax payable by a company according to law is 400,000 yuan, but the tax payable is 1.5 million yuan, the entry should be: debit the capital owner's current account, or tax receivable item, 400,000 yuan, and the prior period profit and loss adjustment number 1.1 million yuan, and credit the tax payable 1.5 million yuan.</p>
<p>Of course, the best of the three situations mentioned above is to be able to offset the public reserve surplus with the tax payable. If it cannot be offset, then it is only appropriate to transfer the account to the prior period profit and loss adjustment number or donation and tax item and list it as the loss of the 35th year. In principle, the levying of income tax should be below the net profit, and there is absolutely no reason to exceed the net profit. Now, the government has the pain of having to collect more than the net profit due to the change in currency value, the delayed collection of taxes, and the inability to match income and expenditure. However, the loss or gain of industrial and commercial enterprises is also an undeniable fact. Therefore, some people believe that it is not inappropriate to list it as a loss item in the 35th year if it exceeds the tax payable amount according to law. As for listing it as a temporary payment item, it is purely a prudent countermeasure. If the tax authorities allow it to be listed as a loss item in the future, it can be transferred to the temporary payment item. Otherwise, it can only wait for a surplus before it can be offset.</p>
<h3>Customs Officer Explains: Procedures for Collecting Goods Tax on Behalf of Importers</h3>
<p>Since the newly promulgated regulations on goods tax were implemented, the customs has been collecting goods tax on imported goods from abroad. However, the general public is not very clear about the collection procedures. A reporter yesterday specifically interviewed a customs officer. According to him, the customs' collection of goods tax on goods imported from abroad is purely to simplify the collection procedures. The method is that when goods that should be subject to goods tax are imported from abroad, the merchant must fill in a goods tax payment certificate and submit it to the customs together with the foreign goods import declaration for inspection. After the customs verifies that the documents match, it intercepts the second, third, and fourth copies of the goods tax payment certificate and hands them over to the merchant to be deposited with the public treasury or the customs tax collection office. The first copy is sent to the competent goods tax authority for record on the next day after the merchant pays the tax. After paying the goods tax, the merchant must hold the second and third copies of the goods tax payment certificate to the customs for review. After the customs verifies that it is correct, it will return the third copy to the merchant for travel with the goods. At the same time, the customs officer will indicate "goods tax collected separately" on the import declaration and cut off the third copy of the goods tax payment certificate for reference. The customs should allow the merchant to first transport the taxed goods with the second copy of the goods tax payment certificate. When the goods arrive at the place where there is a goods tax authority, the merchant should apply to the goods tax authority for verification, and then exchange it for a goods tax payment certificate and paste a stamp. The customs collection of goods tax should be reported to the general affairs department every month for accounting, and a list should be sent to the customs department for verification.</p>
<h3>Rise in American Cotton Prices</h3>
<p>[United Press, New York, 9th] Today, cotton futures rose by up to four dollars per bale due to purchases by textile mills and a lack of sellers. Closing futures prices were unchanged at the lowest and up two and a half cents at the highest. Also, a dispatch from New Orleans on the 9th reported that cotton futures closed steady today, rising seven and a half cents per bale at the lowest and three dollars and five cents at the highest.</p>
<h3>Trial Planting of Tung Trees: Unsuitable American Climate; Disappointments in British Africa, India, Australia, etc.</h3>
<p>Reuters, London – Mr. Bray of the Imperial Institute recently presented a paper stating that the entire commercial supply of tung oil has always come from China. However, most of the Chinese production is still shipped to the United States. In the first six months of 1946, China's exports were only 4,000 tons. The United States began tung oil production as early as 1905. The American Tung Oil Company has continuously improved early planting methods. Currently, the area planted with tung trees in the United States has reached 100,000 acres. However, the American continent is not an ideal area for tung oil production due to early frost concerns. In 1943, U.S. tung oil production was only 23,000 tons, and in 1944 it decreased to 1,100 tons. The British Empire has trialed tung tree planting throughout the empire, but by 1933, the results were mostly disappointing. In 1939, South African tung tree production was 15 tons. Although the oil production figure reached 270 tons in 1943, the results were still not satisfactory. Currently, the annual output of Nyasaland is only about 60 tons. Although Indian tung production was once tried, it still lacks large-scale commercial operations. There are also better hopes for Burmese tung production, with an area of 750 acres planted with tung trees promoted by local gentry. Between 1938 and 1939, Burma exported 62 tons of tung seeds. Australia has also devoted itself to experimental work, but the results seem insignificant.</p>
<h3>Current Situation of the Yumen Oil Mine: New Machinery Arriving Soon</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] A person concerned told our reporter: The recent reduced quantity of oil imports is due to transportation difficulties. The responsible authorities attach great importance to the development of the Yumen Oil Mine. The first batch of machinery shipped from the United States after the war has arrived in Luoyang and will arrive in the mining area in a month, at which time production will be able to increase. The boilers previously lost on the eastern section of the Longhai Railway will be replaced. Recently, due to weather conditions, Yumen oil production has slightly decreased. If the oil produced by the mine is refined with equipment, it can be used for aviation purposes; however, the current policy is that while not neglecting quality, increasing production is more important. In the Northeast, the Japanese used to operate a large-scale oil refinery in Jinzhou, but unfortunately, the important machinery was removed after the victory. The Petroleum Company is currently taking care of it and rectifying it, and work will begin after replenishment next year. As for the shale oil refining project in Fushun, it has not been restored; although the Japanese had this experiment in the past, the production cost was very high.</p>
<h3>Petroleum Company Sends Personnel to Explore Oil Sources in Taiwan</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] In order to increase our country's oil sources, the China Petroleum Corporation dispatched an exploration team to Taiwan two weeks ago to begin exploration work in the western part of the island. A person concerned told our reporter: Taiwan may have oil sources in its geological structure, but although exploration was conducted during the Japanese rule, there were no results. Our country's exploration this time is different from the Japanese in terms of region and technology used, and we hope to have good results.</p>

Also, Article 4 of the previously promulgated "Measures for Setting up Bonuses for Counties and Cities with Excellent Achievements in National Education" originally stipulated that the three most outstanding counties and cities would be given a bonus of 10,000 to 15,000 yuan per county and city, which has now been changed to the Ministry of Education issuing children's reading materials. The Ministry of Education has also cabled the provinces, instructing them to handle the selection and submission in accordance with the regulations and report to the Ministry of Education for verification before the end of November this year.</p>
<h3>Excellent Private Elementary Schools Can be Converted into Substitute National Schools: Ministry of Education Has Formulated Measures</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper, Nanjing, 9th] In order to actively promote national education and strive for universal access, the Ministry of Education has formulated a "Measures for Substitute National Schools" in accordance with the regulations of the National School Law and circulated it to the education administrative authorities of all provinces and cities in the country for compliance. It is understood that the purpose of these substitute national schools is to enable private elementary schools in counties and cities that have not yet universally established national schools, which have excellent performance and have been verified by the competent county and city authorities, and with the consent of the private elementary school board of directors, to be renamed "County," "City," "Township," "Town," and "Bao" substitute national schools in the location where the school is located, and they are still managed, supervised, and guided by the competent education administrative authorities of the county and city governments or the directly administered municipalities to which they are subordinate. The organization, funding, personnel, and name aspects are explored and recorded below:</p>
<p>Organization Aspects</p>
<p>The original private elementary school is limited to the implementation of simple education for school-age children. Since the conversion to a substitute national school, the school shall set up two departments: children's education and education for out-of-school people. Children's education is based on grades one, two, three, and four. If possible, grades five and six may also be set up. Education for out-of-school people is based on the operation of primary adult classes and women's classes. When necessary, advanced classes may also be set up. After being converted into a substitute national school, the curriculum, teaching materials, equipment, teachers, and all facilities shall be handled in accordance with the regulations of the National School and the Central National School Law.</p>
<p>Funding Aspects</p>
<p>After a private elementary school is converted into a substitute national school, its funding shall be borne by the competent education administrative authorities of the county, city, or municipality directly under the central government. However, the original property of the private elementary school shall still be managed by its board of directors and shall not be taken over by the public.</p>
<p>Personnel Aspects</p>
<p>After a private elementary school is converted into a substitute national school, its principal shall be appointed by the county and city government. However, the original principals and teachers shall continue to be retained in principle unless their qualifications are not met or one of the circumstances listed in Article 12 of the Measures for the Appointment, Treatment, Advanced Studies, and Guarantee of National School Teachers and Staff exists.</p>
<p>Name Aspects</p>
<p>If the competent education administrative authority cancels its substitute name, or the private elementary school requests to restore its private nature, it shall be restored to its private status with the consent of the competent education administrative authority and the private elementary school board of directors. If the private elementary school board of directors is unwilling to continue running the school and donates all the school's property to the public, the words "substitute" may be cancelled and the school may be changed to a national school.</p>
<h3>Wu Zhaotang Returns to Nanjing to Discuss the Current Situation of Education in Xi'an</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 10th] Wu Zhaotang, a supervisor of the Ministry of Education, who went to Xi'an to inspect higher education, has now returned to Nanjing after completing his official duties. According to him, the Northwest Institute of Technology is currently holding classes in Xi'an and Xianyang. The first-year students are in Xi'an, and the second, third, and fourth-year students are in Xianyang. The school building problem has been gradually resolved with the assistance of the military headquarters and local authorities. The Northwest Institute of Technology was originally the Peiyang Institute of Technology. The Jiaozuo Institute of Technology has been approved to reopen, but it has not yet materialized. Northwest University is being expanded, with dormitories and dining halls for faculty and staff being added, and it is also planned to merge with the private School of Pharmacy to expand into a medical school. The professors of the Northwest Institute of Technology and Northwest University are extremely poor. The cost of living in Xi'an is very similar to that in Nanjing. Even the popular food youtiao costs 100 yuan per piece. However, the current salary of public teachers in Xi'an is only 360 times, so it is very difficult to maintain a family life.</p>

<h3>Hangzhou is Suffering from an Entertainment Famine</h3>
<p>— Our Newspaper Correspondent Chu Yusheng</p>
<p>Hangzhou, November 1st</p>
<p>The early autumn this year was like a feast of soybeans, and after the Mid-Autumn Festival, the drizzling rain made people feel a desolate chill. Therefore, the osmanthus flowers in Manjuelong were mercilessly beaten by the rain, leaving only a few branches of flowers. The boats on the lake listlessly greeted the people coming and going.</p>
<p>These days, it is already the end of autumn. The weather in Hangzhou is clear and warm like spring. The lovely autumn of Hangzhou actually showed its face before the arrival of early winter, filling the whole day with smiles. The lush green shade on Su Causeway and Bai Causeway is just like West Lake putting on a deep green coat. People from Shanghai, seeing the warm weather, took time out of their busy schedules to come to Hangzhou one after another. As a result, the hotels were full again, and the local product stores and restaurants were doing good business again. The boatmen, the horse-drawn carriages by the lake, and the rickshaw pullers all smiled.</p>
<p>Like a Beautiful Girl Who Has Not Received Deep Cultivation</p>
<p>It is the best time to see red leaves in Xixi and maple leaves in Ninety-Eight Ravine.</p>
<p>Some people say, "Hangzhou is lively in spring and autumn because the climate is warm and the scenery of West Lake is pleasant. Everyone is willing to come to Hangzhou for a visit." Others say, "Hangzhou is only good for its scenery, nothing else is worth mentioning." I want to ask, "Is Hangzhou really only good for its scenery?" Yes, Hangzhou's appearance and substance do not match. I remember Mr. Gong Peicheng, the leader of the municipal inspection team organized by the Zhejiang Provincial Government, once asked me specifically, "Hangzhou is like a beautiful girl, but her soul has not received deep cultivation. Therefore, this beautiful girl can only be looked at, but cannot be talked to."</p>
<p>Today, if we want this beautiful girl to have cultivation, there are certainly many things to do, but the entertainment issue is indeed a very important point. I have met several people who came to Hangzhou, and they almost all said in unison, "When we come to Hangzhou, we swim and play in the water during the day. If there is no moon at night, we have to close the door and sleep."</p>
<p>Inferior Programs Sell Out, Singers Sing Decadent Tunes</p>
<p>Before the war, there was a large auditorium in the Inner West Lake that screened high-quality movies. When you ran into this theater, you were forbidden to crack melon seeds. It can be seen that the audience of this theater was sophisticated, and it staged very good dramas. At the same time, there was a stadium on the shore of West Lake where many people exercised after getting off work. After the war, lower-level dance halls and variety shows flourished for a while. Singers sang decadent songs, and theaters showed outdated plays. Especially in movie theaters, they were still showing films such as "Midnight Song Venue" and "Three Stars Accompanying the Moon". Some even showed "Double Pearl Phoenix", "Bi Yan", "The Golden Powder Family", "Pearl Tower", "Meng Lijun", "Liang Shanbo and Zhu Yingtai", etc., wishing they could put "Burning the Red Lotus Temple" on the screen. Although the theaters in Hangzhou were showing such plays, the audience was still very crowded. A movie theater that specialized in showing films like "Pearl Tower" was almost full every day. The most bizarre thing is that there is a vacant lot on a grand Zhongzheng Road (formerly Yingchai Road) that has been turned into a puppet show venue. This puppet show group is doing quite well, but they only set up some reed sheds, hang two small wooden boards in front of the door with red paper pasted on them, write the play's name, and beat drums as the only way to attract the audience. In addition, storytelling in various teahouses is also an important leisure education activity for the citizens of Hangzhou today.</p>
<p>What about the stadium by the lake? It was covered with houses by the enemy and puppets. Because the person in charge of the venue did not have money, they could not build it properly. The public stadium in the city was overgrown with weeds. Therefore, many good teams could not play when they came to Hangzhou, leaving a little regret for this beautiful lake and mountain city.</p>
<p>The high and low quality of entertainment can be used to judge the cultural level of a place. If there is no way to improve the standard of entertainment in Hangzhou, then Hangzhou will be a girl with a beautiful appearance but a stupid substance, and she may even gradually become degenerate.</p>
<p>The Mayor Talks About a New Plan, Creating an Oriental Hollywood</p>
<p>I have talked to Mayor Zhou Jinguang about this matter. He said that he has a plan to turn Hangzhou into an Oriental Hollywood, located in the Jiuxi Shiba Jian area. There, dozens of roads can be built and several houses can be built, but people with vision must be willing to invest. Secondly, there is the stadium. He means that there is a piece of land in Songmu Chang! It used to be prepared as a riding and archery field, but now it is barren and can be used as a stadium. He also invited Director Shen Jingchu of the Public Works Bureau to accompany me to see it, and showed me how to arrange the layout. I think this method is really good, and the plan is especially good, but it is too slow. Moreover, who is willing to invest such a large sum of money in this kind of undertaking at present?</p>
<p>Now, I want to make a specific proposal: the government should allocate funds to repair the stadium of the Provincial Educational Institution by the lake. If the place is too narrow, then a better basketball court should be built. This basketball court should have locker rooms and stands. If someone asks again where the money will come from? I propose to hold a Sunday Ball Club, holding basketball games every Sunday, selling tickets for each game, and using sports to promote sports. Some people say that Hangzhou may not be able to sell tickets. I say don't sell them too expensive. We can sell tickets for 500 yuan each, or even 200 yuan each. If there are good teams coming, we can sell more tickets. If there are wealthy people who love sports coming to Hangzhou, we can ask them to donate some money. By accumulating sand into a tower and gathering tiny hairs into a fur coat, we can also succeed soon. Don't you see that there is a very good stadium in Guiyang? It has stone stands and the latest type of basketball hoops and frames, and can be used for volleyball and tennis. This is the result of using the method mentioned above.</p>
<p>In addition, we should suggest that a model theater be built on this vacant lot on Yingzi Road. Regarding this model theater, we can first invite merchants to operate it, and the municipal government will supervise it, and after a few years, it will be publicly operated by the city. Various other relatively low-level entertainment activities should be actively improved.</p>
<p>If entertainment is improved in taste and sports are universally developed, then Hangzhou will not become a city with a beautiful appearance but an empty content.</p>
<h3>A Journey to Changhua</h3>
<p>— Our Newspaper Special Correspondent Jiang Muyun</p>
<p>Taiwan, October 20th, Airmail</p>
<p>Taipei is the political and economic center, and also the special capital of Taiwan Province. My duties prevent me from leaving it. However, the actual problems discovered in the provincial capital cannot be solved without delving into the hinterland, especially the low voices of the people, which are isolated in the provincial capital, but deserve the respect of discussion. I am very grateful to Director Lin Zigui of the Propaganda Department of the Provincial Party Headquarters for allowing me to travel with Zheng Zhengren, the editor-in-chief of Guoshi Daily. In fact, Mr. Lin still maintains his reporter's style, exploring the south and using various angles to measure the depth of progress in various places.</p>
<p>Taoyuan, Four Languages</p>
<p>Taoyuan, which has no peach trees, is the first stop on the express train from Taipei to the south. Three months ago, the Hsinchu County Government was driven by the municipal government to move to the northernmost town in the county. The county has a population of 400,000, of which 130,000 are Hakka people from Guangdong, tens of thousands are aboriginal people from the mountains, and the rest are Taiwanese people sandwiched between Zhangzhou and Quanzhou. Among these people, the Hakka people use Hakka, the aborigines use primitive languages, the Taiwanese people use Minnan dialect, and I use Mandarin, which is now barely understood. In any gathering place, when speaking to fellow countrymen, at least two or more languages must be used, otherwise, it will be impossible for them to understand. Only one language is popular - Japanese, but this hostile and poisonous language is forbidden.</p>
<p>The Japanese in Taiwan never allowed you to speak Taiwanese. They would not only punish you but also use torture. From the time you were educated, you were not given the opportunity to speak Taiwanese. The method they attempted to use language to assimilate the people of this province has been at least 90% effective. People must believe that Mandarin has made great progress in Taiwan, but to be honest, apart from the fact that it is spoken in classrooms in various middle schools, how many people use it at home? This cannot be said to be a failure, it can only be said that the power of the province to spontaneously learn Mandarin has not yet been inspired. This power is the stability of life and the clarity of politics.</p>
<p>Taiwanese people don't understand Taiwanese, which seems like a joke, but it is the truth. In Taoyuan, I witnessed a Hakka-speaking chairman who used a Minnan-speaking translator to speak to people who didn't speak Taiwanese, which was awkward. The language barrier has fully explained that language is the main reason for self-isolation. No one does not believe in the importance of the widespread use of Mandarin, but no one can truly achieve it.</p>
<p>Hsinchu, Juvenile Prison</p>
<p>The pure Japanese-style Hsinchu Juvenile Detention Center (Juvenile Prison) is one of the "characteristics" of the city. It is the only one in the province, and almost everyone knows it. The reporters made a special trip to visit it on the morning of the 17th. The high walls built of cement are hidden under coconut trees. The long walls are reminiscent of the appearance of German concentration camps. In this small world of more than 3,700 square meters, 153 juveniles under the age of 20 and 279 adults are detained. At most, it can accommodate 518 people. It needs four bags of rice a day, using sweet potatoes and other non-staple foods. On average, each prisoner can get 364.32 calories of nutritional information per day. In the first five years when the Japanese managed it, the most common crime among juveniles was theft, with 330 people, followed by fraud with 50 people, adultery with 8 people, murder with 6 people, opium addicts with 4 people, and others. After the restoration, theft is still the most common crime.</p>
<p>Warden Lin Zipei allowed the reporters to visit the entire facility, including the detention rooms, classrooms, sports field, and auditorium. He also showed the prisoners with thin, withered bones tilling the fields, printing, typesetting, and binding in the printing room, learning to sew clothes, doing bamboo work, carpentry, and pasting cigarette labels for the Monopoly Bureau. These prisoners, whose fate had been decided, spent their days working to pass the days they had lost their freedom, except for one hour of exercise and one hour of class. More than a dozen female prisoners were squatting on the ground sewing torn clothes, looking like a family. Their detention rooms were even cleaner and more tidy than the male prisoners'. In the garden, several naked juvenile prisoners had stage III syphilis and were almost as thin as bamboo poles. The facility spends about 100,000 yuan a month, and the income from work can make up for 30-40% of it. In the first half of the year, 21 people died among the number of people admitted, because the work and food were normal, the mortality rate was very low.</p>
<p>According to the warden, he is very eager to hope that the people of the province can restore the organization of the Protection Association (the Japanese designated September 17th as Judicial Protection Memorial Day). In this association, they can pay for the travel expenses of released prisoners and introduce them to jobs. He definitely does not want them to come back because they need the support of the association and the government to grow up!</p>
<p>Changhua, An Ancient City</p>
<p>From Hsinchu to Changhua, it is a three-hour train ride. This is an intersection of a line parallel to the railway through Taichung. Because it takes five minutes to pass through the Shitouwu tunnel to Taichung, passengers prefer to take the coast line to avoid the smoke. The train passes countless small forks in the sea, crossing the coastal plains. Looking out the window, the blue sea is endless on the right, and the white waves are tightly connected to the sandy beach. Plump water buffalo graze through the white sugar cane flowers and head towards the plains. Ah, it is autumn after all, the poetic and tranquil edge of the sea.</p>
<p>As soon as you get off the train, you see the dilapidated remnants of the wartime scene in Changhua City. The southern Chinese-style ancient buildings are set off by the stalls set up with bamboo sheds, selling retail food. The road is paved with stones and full of mud and ash. The afternoon weather is still so hot that it makes people dizzy. We first went to see the oldest Confucian temple in the province. Only the main hall still stands majestically, and the front courtyard and the two wings are dilapidated. Changhua is praised as the birthplace of culture, but apart from the fact that there are four middle schools and four national schools, there are no more signs to be found.</p>
<p>Mayor Wang told reporters that the city has only 60,000 people (40,000 in the urban area). In the past, there were 300 staff members, but now there are only 110. Because the scope is small, the finances are not difficult, and salaries are paid monthly. There are more than 200 poor households in the city, at most 500 people are unemployed. If the sugar factory 6 kilometers away resumes work next year, there will be no problem with employment, he said: It is very reasonable to make Changhua a self-governing city. The local councilors demanded the abolition of Changhua City and the relocation of Taichung County here, on the grounds that it was the county seat 52 years ago and is located in the center of Taichung.</p>
<p>There is Bagua Mountain in the city. The Japanese arranged it as a scenic area, but in reality, there is only a pavilion and two hostels. We spent the night in the Central Guest House. Mr. Guo Yaoting, one of the representatives of the Kuomintang, told me that they had suffered hardships here. Twenty-six years ago, the Japanese arrested more than 1,000 anti-Japanese elements, and some were arrested here. There is a natural water source on the mountain, but because the reservoir is not enough, the city's daily water supply of 4,000 tons has become a problem, and the water supply is stopped in the afternoon.</p>
<h3>The State of Pig Production</h3>
<p>— Wang Han'ou</p>
<p>Special Dispatch from this Newspaper</p>
<p>Recently, there has been a pork panic in Shanghai and other places, with market prices soaring, and occasional laments of "no meat" heard. Speaking of pork, one cannot help but pay attention to its production area – northern Jiangsu. The major pig-producing areas in northern Jiangsu are in Rugao, Jingjiang, and Hai'an counties. Currently, pig production has sharply declined, and the situation has suddenly changed, which not only affects the meat-eating problem of people in southern Jiangsu, but also severely impacts the economy of rural northern Jiangsu. This sudden change is accompanied by more than a year of internal turmoil in northern Jiangsu.</p>
<p>The important export commodities of northern Jiangsu are grain, followed by pigs, chickens, ducks, eggs, etc., with pigs being the largest. The large-scale pig exports include the Huai pigs from the Lianghuai area and the Zhuang pigs from the local area. Relatively speaking, Zhuang pork is more tender because they are fed barley, bean cakes, pigweed, etc., which are rich in nutrients, so they can grow faster. Families with the most cultivated land raise the most pigs, with some families raising twenty or thirty pigs. Families that can raise so many pigs must be middle peasants and rich peasants. Their family financial situations must not be bad.</p>
<p>In the rural areas around the western part of the county, it was not uncommon for farming families to raise twenty or thirty pigs. The reason for this is that the county has a high population density and little arable land, so farmers who have spare money cannot buy land and prefer to raise pigs to increase production. The conditions for raising pigs are building pigsties, storing barley and bean cakes, buying piglets, or raising an old sow to breed piglets from time to time. If you calculate it, how much capital does it take to raise a pigsty full of pigs?</p>
<p>When raising pigs, you have to get up early every morning to cut pigweed and grind barley. Mix the two together, cook them in a pot, and feed the pigs bucket by bucket, two or three times a day. When they grow into "Erkaizi" (half-grown), they need to be fattened, then grind bean cakes to feed them. Pigs don't like to eat other food after eating bean cakes, but bean cakes are expensive, so farmers will never easily feed them bean cakes unless they need to be sold when they grow up.</p>
<p>If the Zhuang pigs are infected with plague, the farmer's hard work and capital will be completely in vain. Farmers all regard pigs as their own children and lives, and various pig-raising superstitions are popular in the countryside. Also, because pigs are an important asset for farmers, when children get married, they first inquire about how many Zhuang pigs there are in the family's pigsty. For example, farmers in the western rural areas of Rugao and Hai'an work hard in production, and every family raises a lot of pigs, so every family is rich, so in the past there was the saying "Golden Rugao and Hai'an".</p>
<p>When pigs are raised to a certain stage, if something happens in the family and they need money, they can easily "transfer" the pigs to others, which is more convenient than farming. When the pigs are big enough and sold to pig dealers, it is called "Chu Quan" (leaving the pigsty), and neighbors are invited to eat "He Shi" (shared meal) as a celebration. The pig money is paid in installments, and the dealers only give him "piaozi" (notes), with many long terms, giving him a layer of exploitation. However, the farmers don't object to it, because after the pigs "leave the sty", they get a large amount of cash, which is easy to be stolen. It is better to have the "piaozi" in hand and slowly exchange them for food or other items on the street. It is useless for robbers to rob the "piaozi".</p>
<p>When the pseudo "Central Reserve Certificates" were popular, the currency inflated extremely, and prices continued to rise. Cunning speculators created slippery firms specializing in "piaozi" business, taking away the farmers' cash and giving the farmers "piaozi" with long terms, and hoarding goods or lending them out for interest. When the farmers took the "piaozi" to exchange for goods, the price of the goods had already risen a lot, and the farmers sometimes could not calculate the losses on it. Merchants who opened exchange houses all over the country made a living from "piaozi", and countless people and their families were supported. Moreover, with the "piaozi" circulating around, it sometimes affected the "money supply" and market price fluctuations in various places. It can be seen that the Zhuang pig in northern Jiangsu is related to the market economy.</p>
<p>During the occupation period, the enemy and puppets went to the countryside to ravage, and the loss of pig products and other by-products in rural areas was great, but the farmers still continued to concurrently manage; because this was related to their lives and wealth, and they struggled for survival, they could only fight to the end. Therefore, although there were times when pork was disconnected in various parts of southern Jiangsu due to traffic problems, it was not as panic-stricken as it is now. The current pig shortage situation has another major reason:</p>
<p>Since the Communist army of northern Jiangsu "liberated" several cities in Rugao last year, they have noticed that pig exports are a major economic link in northern Jiangsu, and they have listed it as one of their "industrial and commercial management" policies, designating several counties in Rugao that produce pigs as a "Special Zone of Subei" to manage pig exports and earn foreign exchange. However, because the farmers did not believe in his "Anti-Japanese currency" and control policies, they secretly talked business directly with pig merchants, exchanging each dan (a unit of weight) of pigs for a certain amount of barley or sesame oil. The barley and oil were delivered when the pigs were sold. However, when the pig merchants transported the Zhuang pigs to Shanghai to sell for legal currency and returned to exchange them for "Anti-Japanese currency" with the "Central China Bank", the price of barley had already risen sharply, and the price of a pig often did not even cover half a pig. Those pig merchants with bad intentions then "slipped away"! The farmers suffered losses and did not have barley to feed the pigs, which naturally affected pig production. This is one of the initial reasons.</p>
<p>Secondly, since the beginning of spring this year, the various movements launched in the "Liberated Areas": "struggle against landlords", families that raise pigs have not suffered deeply from the enemy and puppets, they must "have colluded", and their grain and pigs are fined; "disaster relief", families that raise pigs have a large amount of barley stored, and they are asked to donate a portion to "disaster relief"; "land redistribution", the land is scattered, and there are no middle peasants and rich peasants, and everyone is not qualified to raise a large number of pigs. In addition, farmers, because of their aversion to the "Liberated Areas", have massively exported Zhuang pigs since the spring and summer of this year, exchanged them for funds in the recovered areas, and fled outside, not flowing the funds back. Zhuang pig production has been severely hit and sharply reduced. This phenomenon was not felt by everyone when the pigs were massively exported in the summer until the "end of the map is revealed" and the famine situation emerged.</p>
<p>In addition, there are currently troops everywhere in northern Jiangsu, and transportation is not smooth! Guest troops gather, and meat consumption increases sharply; there is only consumption and no production. If this continues, although it will not be completely extinct, the future of meat consumption for people in southern and northern Jiangsu is not optimistic. Therefore, the only way to solve this problem at present is to quickly pacify the local area, so that the villagers in various places can return to farming as soon as possible; and the government should try to provide loans to support and restore pig production; this is also one of the important policies for stabilizing the countryside and relieving farmers in the future.</p>
<h3>The International Illustrated Magazine for the Paris Peace Conference's Propaganda Agency is Exquisite</h3>
<p>— Reported by Hongfu from Paris</p>
<p>Airmail dispatch on the 25th</p>
<p>Since the beginning of the First World War thirty years ago, countries have been engaged in propaganda, with smaller efforts aimed at increasing the prosperity of a nation, and larger efforts aimed at influencing the destiny of the world. Having experienced and compared various situations, I feel that the clarity of guidance and the agility of methods have never been as impressive as the French government's propaganda organization at the Second Paris Peace Conference in 1946. The French have demonstrated their ingenuity in every way, and have not missed this once-in-a-century opportunity.</p>
<p>The "Hotel de Seillery", the most exquisite and magnificent building in the center of Paris (Note: Seillery was the pen name of the third wife of King Louis XIV), served as the residence for American officers and the meeting place for United Nations reporters during the war. The French government, taking advantage of this convenience, has now borrowed the entire "first floor" for the Office of Press Information, directly under the Prime Minister, to carry out its work. Various sections have assigned specialists. The bureau, under the director, is divided into eight sections: (1) Secretary assisting the director with daily affairs, (2) Administration (internal affairs, also known as general affairs), (3) Missions (external affairs), (4) Liaison (spiritual assistance to attendees), such as answering questions from attendees, inquiring on their behalf, and responding to inquiries, (5) Facilitation (material assistance to attendees), such as assisting attendees in obtaining food ration coupons and reserving seats in theaters, etc., (6) Service d'accueil (small matters), including the hotel's special newspaper and magazine room and the reporter's studio, (7) Accreditement (certification of attendees' qualifications), and (8) Transnissionw (transmission, handling incoming and outgoing mail, inquiring about telegram rates, etc.), with a mail room for receiving letters on behalf of people and a copy room for sending letters on behalf of people. In addition, writing, printing, telephone answering, and dispatching services for drivers are all handled quickly and responsively. As for foreign guests seeking accommodation and sightseeing in Paris, the organization has employed 135 guides to receive approximately 1,600 male and female tourists. The most interesting aspect of spiritual assistance is addressing the occasional questions raised by those attending the conference. When the organization encounters matters that cannot be answered immediately, it uses telephones or telegrams, or long-distance calls, free of charge, to quickly investigate.</p>
<p>During the two-month conference period, as many as 9,760 questions were answered, half of which were answered immediately, one-quarter within two hours, and the remaining one-quarter within twenty-four hours. The most distant inquiries, which took the most effort to investigate, were answered within three days at the latest. Previously, elusive and wonderful ideas that could not be found anywhere were now found through this investigation. The general feeling towards the French government and Greater Paris has deepened because of this conference. The effectiveness of the French government's propaganda far outweighs the material pleasures. The highest achievement of our country's old-fashioned "hospitality" is only equivalent to one aspect of "material" assistance. How can it be like the Paris Peace Conference, which emphasizes both the spiritual and the material? The current trend of the world is progressing rapidly. Although "hospitality" is a small matter, if it is not diligently pursued, it can easily fall behind. How can the use of our eyes and ears be relaxed for even a moment?</p>
<p>Switzerland has always maintained a neutral position, mediating between the major and minor countries of the world. The freedom of newspapers and publications has always attracted attention. As for printing, it is particularly exquisite. The most refined printing is for illustrations. LIllustre, a newspaper published in Lausanne, Switzerland, is printed using Rotogravure, which can print 12,000 copies per hour, with three-color gravure illustrations. The illustrations are vivid and lifelike, making it a good model for the latest periodical publications. In 1921, after the First World War, the League of Nations, which was born out of the Paris Peace Conference, gathered representatives from various countries on the shores of Lake Leman. The lakeside newspaper arose in response to the times, widely selecting illustrations of international trends and creating historical archives of world events.</p>
<p>This year, coinciding with the grand peace conference, we see it again in Paris, and a 25th anniversary commemorative publication has been specially compiled. The internal structure of the newspaper is quite detailed. Visitors can start from the bottom floor. The basement is divided into two levels: the lower level is the storage room for rolled paper, and the upper level is the machine room for printing newspapers. Above that is the ground floor with a large entrance and the advertising department. To the left is the manager's office. Above that is the second floor, with the editorial department on the right and the Dactylos (typing room) on the left. Above that is the third floor, with the typesetting room for small samples of typesetting (Conpostiton Typos) on the right and the layout room for combining large samples (Miss en page) on the left. Above that is the fourth floor, which cannot be reached by elevator, with the photography room on the right and the plate-making room and retouching room on the left. The top floor has a rooftop terrace for sightseeing, and to the right is a wine bar for dining. In summary, the entire building, from top to bottom, has the model of a first-class American newspaper building. Readers should not underestimate it because of its small size.</p>
<h3>Interlude of the Jining Campaign</h3>
<p>— Our Correspondent Song Shaobo</p>
<p>Fengzhen, October 5th</p>
<p>Generals on the Front Line</p>
<p>The senior generals of the Twelfth War Area do not have the pretentious Hitler-like airs. Except for Commander Fu, the division commanders all have nicknames. Comrades-in-arms use nicknames instead of names, and the officers do not feel insulted but feel very close. They usually live with the soldiers, and in wartime they also stand on the same line with the soldiers to fight. For example, the command position of General Huang Qiwu, commander of the "Lijin" Column, is always within the range of the enemy's artillery fire; General Sun Lanfeng, commander of the "Fuxing" Column, has commanded battles in Bailingmiao, Xinkou, Baotou, Wuyuan, etc. He was seriously wounded in the leg and is nicknamed "Crutch General". In this Jining Campaign, he personally led the cavalry to attack the city before the infantry arrived, in order to avenge the hatred of the Communist army using 50,000 infantry to seize Jining from the hands of the National army's 5,000 elite soldiers after the ceasefire order was issued on January 13th of this year.</p>
<p>Brigadier General Wang Jianzhong, deputy commander of the "Victory" Sub-Column, personally led two companies to break through the city, which is rarely seen in internal warfare; and Lieutenant General Liu Wanchun, deputy commander of the "Fengjin" Column, even went to the position of a platoon to command. In this Jining Campaign, Lieutenant General Liu Wanchun can be said to have traveled all over the mountains outside the city and through the streets inside the city. Whenever he saw a unit faltering, he would run there to persuade the officers and encourage the soldiers. With a deputy commander helping him command the combat mission of a company commander, how could he not win the battle? When the soldiers saw the lieutenant general fighting alongside them, how could they not advance bravely? Brigadier General Guo Jingyun, commander of the "Guoguang" Detachment, personally threw grenades to repel the enemy when the Communist army attacked the command post on the night of the 12th; Brigadier General E Youqi, commander of the "Qingshan" Detachment, always rode on horseback and fired a gun during every charge.</p>
<p>When Commander Fu was besieged in Guisui last year, he was on the front line in Balizhuang, where his overcoat was pierced by a Communist army bullet. After Datong was besieged, he flew alone to encourage the soldiers, and his wing was also hit. During this Jining Campaign, he did not sleep for four days and nights. The senior staff of the Commander's Department all had bloodshot eyes. On the 14th, the Communist army was still outside Jining, engaged in a mixed battle with our chasing troops, and Commander Fu ran to the houses of the people to visit the officers and soldiers and comfort the masses. Although the enemy withdrew from the Datong airfield on the 24th, there were still Communist troops entrenched east of Shaling, and he was the first to fly to Datong to comfort the soldiers guarding the city. This made the soldiers and civilians in Suiyuan and Yanbei feel that "our commander is always standing with us."</p>
<p>What the Executive Group Saw</p>
<p>The Jining Group of the Military Mediation Headquarters was still stored in the city during the Jining Campaign. At the beginning, the Communist army sent troops to closely supervise the American representative O'Quinn, the government representative Yin Hanchu, and the welcoming official Wu Yue of the Twelfth War Area. They pointed their guns at everyone's mouths with a prepared posture, as if the police were guarding prisoners. Therefore, O'Quinn demanded that the American flag be hung on the house of the Executive Group, but was rejected by the Communist army. Later, when the National army broke into the city and Yao Zhe was expelled by us from the "Military Region" headquarters, and he set up the command post under the wall of the Executive Group, he allowed the American flag to be hung on the roof. So that the shells would not fall nearby. Yao Zhe seemed to be following the moon, so he could not help but say that he had benefitted.</p>
<p>After the American flag was hung on the house of the Executive Group, O'Quinn took a telescope to observe from the roof. The heroic performance of many of the attacking troops was seen by this allied officer. Every time the "Victory" Detachment attacked a stronghold, there was always a squad of flag-raising daredevils in front, braving the enemy's machine gun fire and rushing towards the Communist army's stronghold. Like Sun Sikong, the Communist army soldiers were unable to resist. On the afternoon of the 13th, before our army had attacked the Mongolian Bank and the Police Bureau, these two strongholds were already flying the national flag, and two soldiers were smoking Yanghuo while holding machine guns. Later, we conducted an investigation. The warrior standing on the roof of the Mongolian Bank was Liang Chaosheng of the Third Battalion of the "Victory" Detachment, and the commander of the "Jinjin" Column, Chang Mianxu, promised to marry him a wife. The sergeant squad leader Gao Xuechuan of the Eighth Platoon of the First Battalion of the "Victory" Detachment, who was on the roof of the Police Bureau, has decided to change his name to Saijun Wei as a model for all troops.</p>
<p>Lieutenant Colonel O'Quinn is over ninety years old this year and has participated in the First and Second World Wars and the Pacific War, but he has never seen the National army fight so bravely. He said, "Stalingrad is a competition for strongholds, and the Jining Campaign is a competition for homes." This time, the Communist army was unwilling to give up their homes, and the National army desperately drove the Communist army out of their homes. Several times he saw the National army unable to resist, and the situation was about to falter, but at the critical moment, the National army always turned defeat into victory. Therefore, after the Communist army withdrew from Jining, Lieutenant Colonel O'Quinn saw the "Lijin" Column Commander raise his thumb and said, "No wonder General Wedemeyer said that Commander Fu's army can fight. The soldiers of the Twelfth War Area are really top-notch."</p>
<p>Defeated Soldiers Become Powerful Troops</p>
<p>The Communist army is by no means like sheep. When they are being escorted, they will flee as soon as possible. The National army is also not a heavenly soldier who can summon wind and rain. Therefore, in this great victory of the Jining Campaign, we also had many small failures. For example, on the evening of the 11th, the "Yellow River" Detachment faltered, the command post of the "Youth" Detachment was attacked, and the command post of the "Lijin" Column was also affected. The wounded soldiers only saw that our heavy machine guns were taken away by the Communist army, and did not see that the National army later used unlit hand grenades to smash the enemy's bags and regain them. Therefore, they spread these defeats, disrupting the morale of the army. Especially the miscellaneous soldiers such as cooks and grooms spread the news, confusing the reserve troops.</p>
<p>On the afternoon of the 12th, the National army, which was scattered from Luotuowanzi, retreated to the Tuyu area. Supply soldiers and medical vehicles were all over the ravines and mountains. There were more than a thousand scattered soldiers, all running towards Taolin. The rear officers of each unit lost their command ability and could not stop the retreating soldiers from fleeing backwards. The situation was very bad at the time. Coincidentally, Wei Chunmei, the commander of the Second Column of the People's Local Self-Defense Work, led the returning team from eastern Suiyuan to the outskirts of Jining. When the people saw the army retreating, they unceremoniously stopped them with guns. Commander Wei temporarily announced two reception chiefs, gathered them together, and after a speech, led the returning team to reopen the Jining front line.</p>
<p>If these more than 1,000 defeated soldiers had walked to Taolin, I don't know what kind of situation the rear would have been in. But under the supervision of the people, they became a vital force. They were all separated from other units at night, and the National army commanders did not see them losing contact, nor did the Communist army discover that they had left. They were a scattered force when they withdrew from Jining, and an orderly force when they returned to Jining. When the "Guoguang" Detachment was reinforcing from the southwest, they also returned to the camp from the northwest. This made both the enemy and us think that in addition to the "Guoguang" Detachment, there was another detachment in the army. Unexpectedly, these defeated soldiers gave our soldiers unlimited courage and gave the enemy's nerves a great blow in the Jining Campaign.</p>
<h3>Public Trial of Tianjin Corruption Case</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent Li Shaolin</p>
<p>Tianjin Telegram, 6th</p>
<p>Two sensational events have been investigated in Tianjin: one is the corruption case of Army Colonel Liu Naiyi, which has been transferred to the Beiping Military Training Office; the other is the case of the Tianjin Transportation Office of the Public Works Bureau accepting bribes. The actors involved include Wang Xijun, Director of the Public Works Bureau; Yao Zhenli, Director of the Transportation Office; Zhang Xiaochun, Chief of the General Affairs Section of the Transportation Office; Zhu Shu'an, Chief of the Treasury Section; Wang Shisheng, Director of the Treasury; Jia Zhongqun, Staff Member; Luo Chengwei, Chief Secretary of the Public Works Bureau; Liu Jingda, Section Chief; and others, as well as Li Changtian, Manager of Dexingshun Coal Shop; Feng Yunshan, Manager of Juxing Printing Bureau; Wang Zhenting, Manager of Yudong Printing Shop; Liu Dianshi, Manager of Decheng Belt Factory, and a total of twelve people who purchased and sold stolen goods. This case was transferred by the investigation team to the Tianjin District Court, and a public prosecution was filed by the Procuratorate. The first hearing was held on the 21st. The trial began at 9:00 AM and lasted until 8:00 PM, with a two-hour break at noon. The defendants and subpoenaed witnesses, a total of 29 people, stood in a semi-circle before the judge's desk, extremely crowded. As many as seven lawyers appeared in court. After 6:00 PM, the courtroom suddenly lost power and was plunged into darkness. Later, bailiffs entered with candles for a night trial. Each defendant was interrogated one by one before the court adjourned. The conviction of the accused remains to be determined after further hearings.</p>
<p>An Account of Rice and Flour Embezzled from the Ministry of Relief</p>
<p>According to the results of the investigation by the investigation team, the District Court's Procuratorate determined that the defendants had committed thirteen counts of crimes: (1) Establishing the Transportation Office of the Public Works Bureau by reorganizing and taking over the enemy's Tianjin Transportation Co., Ltd., borrowing seven million yuan in legal tender from the city's banks in the name of resuming operations, which was jointly embezzled and divided by Wang Xijun, Yao Zhenli, and Zhang Xiaochun; (2) Falsifying account books and receipts for wages, fodder, and office expenses for the former Beiyang Army, with Yao Zhenli and Zhang Xiaochun jointly embezzling more than four million yuan in legal tender; (3) Stealing and selling 49 tons of raw coal and 27 tons of coke to Li Changtian, earning over three million five hundred thousand yuan in illicit gains, which were jointly divided by Wang Xijun, Yao Zhenli, and Zhang Xiaochun; (4) Stealing and selling 36 reams of paper to Feng Yunshan and Wang Zhenting, earning 900,000 yuan in legal tender, which was jointly divided by Yao Zhenli, Zhang Xiaochun, Luo Chengwei, and Liu Jingda; (5) Stealing and selling nine boxes of matches, earning over seven million yuan in counterfeit currency, which was divided by Yao Zhenli, Zhang Xiaochun, Zhu Gen'an, Xia Binsheng, Jia Zhongqun, and the warehouse keeper; (6) Stealing and selling sixteen automobile tires to Liu Dianqing, earning over 500,000 yuan in legal tender, with Yao Zhenli and Zhang Xiaochun jointly responsible; (7) Stealing and selling three live mules, earning over 200,000 yuan in legal tender, with Yao Zhenli and Zhang Xiaochun jointly responsible; (8) Stealing and selling over one thousand bags of flour, with Yao Zhenli and Zhang Xiaochun responsible; (9) Wang Xijun embezzled over ten bags of flour, eighty catties of rice, matches, sugar, and other items; (10) Yao Zhenli embezzled four hundred catties of flour, two hundred catties of rice, matches, cigarettes, and other items; (11) Luo Chengwei and Liu Jingda jointly profited from five bags of flour; (12) Yao Zhenli and Zhang Xiaochun altered the original register of the enemy's Tianjin Transportation Co., Ltd., in an attempt to conceal the investigation; (13) Five hundred bags of flour, rubber tires, snowmobiles, and other items in the warehouse were not listed in the handover receipts to the customs.</p>
<p>Deceptive Confessions, Wang Xijun Denies Receiving Bribes</p>
<p>During the court hearing, except for Zhu Shu'an, Jia Zhongqun, and Liu Dianqing, whose whereabouts were unknown, the remaining nine defendants were escorted to court at the same time for questioning. Wang Xijun, 36 years old, testified that he had studied at London University in England and Harvard University in the United States. He was appointed Director of the Tianjin Public Works Bureau on October 2nd of last year and took over the former Tianjin Transportation Co., Ltd. on November 20th, entrusting Yao Zhenli to handle the matter on his behalf. Regarding the Municipal Government's previous secret report ordering the Public Works Bureau to investigate Yao Zhenli's corruption, and the Public Works Bureau's reply that there was no corruption, Wang claimed that it was handled entirely by the Chief Secretary Luo Chengwei. He also flatly denied all allegations of dividing and embezzling received materials, claiming that he had not received them or knew about them, even though Zhang Xiaochun's "black ledger" recorded each time money and goods were delivered to him. Witnesses testified that the goods were delivered to his residence and taken away by servants.</p>
<p>Full of Lies, Zhang Xiaochun Exposed Many Flaws</p>
<p>The black ledgers, fake receipts, and original registers found by the investigation team were all seized from Zhang Xiaochun's desk. Therefore, when questioning this 54-year-old man, Zhang Xiaochun, although he repeatedly denied the charges, he had no way to escape the accusations, and many flaws were exposed, making him look ridiculous. Not only did the audience in the gallery burst into laughter, but even the presiding judge covered his mouth and chuckled. When the judge showed him the original register that had been altered and the original register that had not been altered, Zhang stammered, "There—there isn't much difference." When his black ledger was shown, Zhang said that it was not a ledger but a plan he made when he had nothing to do. The judge said that the ledger stated that the actual expenditure was over two million yuan, but the reimbursement was over seven million yuan, and there were falsified receipts. How could that be called a plan? Why was there a surplus of over five million yuan? He then confessed that it was for future public expenditures. The judge asked where such a reimbursement method existed. He replied, "It was not actually reimbursed." When asked if the millions of yuan listed on the ledger for a certain person were the proceeds from selling materials, he confessed, "That wasn't a division, but a subsidy for resettlement expenses." Regarding the payment of 1.6 million yuan for coal to Wang Xijun listed on the ledger, he confessed that it had already been recovered. When asked why it was not recorded on the mine's ledger, he confessed, "I probably forgot." The judge ridiculed him, saying, "Only you can understand this kind of ledger." As for the sale of mules, witnesses testified that they were live mules. When asked why live mules were recorded as dead mules, he confessed, "I only found out later that they were still alive when they were sold." Regarding the sale of various materials, he confessed that he had reported everything to Yao Zhenli. Regarding the matter of forging store seals, he claimed that they were difficult to find when he took over. Regarding the alteration of the original register, he blamed the Treasury Section. The corrupt account was repeatedly questioned by the judge until he was speechless.</p>
<p>Escorted from Shenyang to Tianjin, Yao Zhenli's Face Full of Cunning</p>
<p>Yao Zhenli fled to Qingyang before the investigation team came to Tianjin. After the case was exposed, he was arrested and brought to Tianjin. Yao, 51 years old, from Shenyang, had a cunning look on his face and gave deceptive confessions. The judge asked if Zhang Xiaochun said that he had reported everything to you regarding the sale of various materials. He confessed that the Transportation Office had no funds and had to find ways to spend money, so he had told Zhang that anything that could be bought back could be sold. He was also asked why the materials he received did not match the original register and the numbers handed over to the customs. He confessed, "I am responsible for what I received, but the register was made in October, and it was two months before I took over. Many items were stolen during that time." Regarding the division and sale of coal, paper, and the money received, Yao claimed, "I don't know, there is no such thing." Regarding the embezzlement of rice and flour, he claimed that they were rations. During the interrogation of the defendants, the judge repeatedly summoned witnesses to prove the crimes of the defendants. When the court adjourned, the judge announced that the trial would be adjourned and heard again at a later date. The prisoners were sent back to jail, and the seven lawyers left the courtroom with an almost listening attitude, because even the lawyers had been amused by Zhang Xiaochun's contradictory confessions, no different from the audience. This live drama of corruption was temporarily adjourned.</p>

<h3>Taking Pride in Being an Industrialist</h3>
<p>— Editor</p>
<p>Since China is embarking on the path of industrialization, it must first have industrialists who are dedicated to hard work. At present, being an industrialist is not easy, because he must have a strong will, a spirit of forging ahead, and make constant efforts in construction regardless of all difficulties.</p>
<p>Recently, Mr. Fu Jiajun and Mr. Wang Wei of the Xinguang Underwear Factory made a brief seven-day stop in Hong Kong and Guangzhou, where they were warmly welcomed by the local industrial circles. All newspapers used large headlines to report their arrival in Hong Kong and Guangzhou. This can be said to be the concern of compatriots for the industrial circles in Shanghai, and it can also illustrate that being an industrialist is the most glorious thing.</p>
<p>If China's industrialists all take pride in being industrialists and work hard in construction, then it will be of considerable benefit to the progress of industry.</p>
<h3>Problems of China's Textile Industry</h3>
<p>— Deng Shaoqiu</p>
<p>The occurrence of a thing or a phenomenon must have a crux to it. In order to remedy or promote the occurrence of this thing or phenomenon, we must first understand the cause of the occurrence of this thing or phenomenon, that is, to thoroughly understand the crux of its occurrence. Only then can we find appropriate remedies by prescribing the right medicine. Similarly, in order to revive China's textile industry, we must thoroughly understand the factors of the rise and fall of the textile industry and the crux of its occurrence, and then seek remedies from the factors and crux obtained.</p>
<p>Now, let us first summarize some of the crux of the rise and fall of China's textile industry based on the past (see the first paragraph) development process of China's textile industry:——</p>
<p>(A) Regarding the problems of the textile industry itself:</p>
<p>(1) Machine problems.</p>
<p>(2) Equipment issues.</p>
<p>(3) Management issues.</p>
<p>(4) Personnel issues.</p>
<p>(5) Funding issues.</p>
<p>(B) Regarding other issues:</p>
<p>(1) National economic situation.</p>
<p>(2) The situation of the production and supply of textile raw materials.</p>
<p>The tool for the textile industry to compete is machinery, and in order to achieve the goal of winning the competition, the first requirement is the excellence of the machinery. However, most of the machinery in the textile factories in our country is 20 years old. Only a very small number of newly built textile factories have relatively new machinery. In addition, there are also a few factories that have been reorganized or renovated from old machines. This is the biggest weakness of our textile factories. Imagine competing with foreign factories that have new machinery with outdated machinery. How can we win?</p>
<p>Secondly, the equipment of the factory can also be said to be a prerequisite for a good factory. Good equipment leads to good work and efficiency. This is almost a natural law, but in the past, the equipment of our factories was very simple and was not well taken care of. All testing instruments, transportation equipment, etc. were all simple and crude. In recent years, due to the recession in the textile industry, all the simple equipment has not only not been improved, but has become even more barren. As a result, the resulting products cannot achieve good results.</p>
<p>The quality of work technology and the quality of talents also have a great mutual relationship, but in the past, various factories did not pay much attention to the issue of personnel selection. Most of the staff were introduced to the factory by relatives and friends. Therefore, how is this person's work skills? What about textile knowledge? Most of them are ignored and unquestioned, and a common phenomenon in Chinese factories is - various factions are born in the factory, so the evil trend of "intrigue, deception, and cunning" is promoted, which not only cannot promote the factory's own future prosperity, but instead promotes the factory's early closure. Even self-preservation cannot be talked about, so how can we talk about competition?</p>
<p>Funds are as important to a factory as blood is to life. If blood does not circulate, people cannot survive. If funds do not circulate smoothly, the factory will be difficult to exist. Therefore, to develop a factory, you must first have sufficient funds. However, in the past, the various textile factories in our country prepared too little working capital, so that once they encountered sluggish sales or too much inventory, they had to stop work and reduce production, resulting in great losses. However, when sales are extremely smooth, they feel that supply cannot meet demand. This is a common phenomenon in general factories in our country in the past, and how can this kind of "grabbing Peter to pay Paul" promote the factory's own business!</p>
<p>However, the main reason for the decline of the textile industry in the past was due to improper management by the factory, but the weak national economy, the withering of the rural areas, and the improper supply of raw materials were not the reasons why the textile industry could not prosper. Indeed, what various factories felt extremely painful in the past was the deformed phenomenon of "stagnant sales" and "expensive raw materials and cheap products." To eliminate this deformed phenomenon, we can only stabilize the national economy and prosper the rural areas. At the same time, the production and transportation of textile raw materials must also be well controlled. Otherwise, it will never be eliminated.</p>
<h3>Research on Colors in Factories</h3>
<p>— Lin Han</p>
<p>Translated from "Scientific American" September issue</p>
<p>The use of colors in factories is now becoming a strong trend. Because it has been proven that the meticulous selection of colors in industry can improve the visual environment, thereby increasing production; in addition, it can also improve the atmosphere, increase safety, and facilitate factory management.</p>
<p>In fact, the concept of carefully using colors in factories is not new. Magazines have published articles on it almost ten years ago, and it is widely used today. For example, the National Safety News magazine published in the United States in 1937 published the following passage: "In the maintenance projects in recent times, colors with high reflectance other than white are often used, because they not only diffuse light, but also increase the excitement of employees. Color makes people happy, and its effect on workers is no less than the effect of attractively colored goods on customers. Now, the effectiveness of improving the atmosphere of factories and the good ideas of employees by the application of colors is increasing." "Machines with bright colors are easier to keep clean. In practice, it is now gradually tending to paint machines with a gentle Prussian blue, so that workers can see more easily and reduce the strain on their eyes, even when staring at machine movements for a long time." Although the application of colors in industry has made great progress since this passage was written, it is still equally applicable today. It actually represents the cornerstone of the history of industrial colors.</p>
<p>Increase production</p>
<p>The first thing to consider when using colors in industry is to increase production. The proper selection of colors can reduce the glare of walls and ceilings and improve the visual environment. When the colors on the machine are brighter, the light under the work and the light in the environment can be more average, which is a necessary condition for maintaining extreme vision.</p>
<p>The results of long-term research on psychological factors have proven that when the light at work is five times the light in the environment, the ability to see is reduced to 77% of normal. Conversely, if the light in the environment is five times the light at work, the ability to see is reduced to 44%. It is most appropriate when the light in the environment and the light at work are roughly the same. This situation can be achieved if the color is chosen appropriately. A factory in the southern United States that manufactures conduit fittings reported that a study showed that the output of its workers was reduced by one-third in the morning and about one-tenth in the afternoon. After repainting the colors in the factory, the output did not decrease even when working until 11:00 a.m. and 4:00 p.m.</p>
<p>Improve the atmosphere</p>
<p>Almost as important as the above is the role of colors in creating an atmosphere. Because workers in factories often spend most of their time in the factory, there should be a reasonable, happy, and attractive atmosphere around them. It has been proven that the efficiency of employees often increases due to constant changes in the environment or work. This change can be carried out by increasing wages, changing work, or changing the form of a new factory. In addition, painting the walls, ceilings, and machines with new colors is also a way to improve the atmosphere.</p>
<p>Cleanliness and safety</p>
<p>From a practical point of view, experience tells us that when machines, walls, and ceilings are painted with attractive colors, workers will keep this factory cleaner. Because workers will feel very proud of the beauty of their environment and will continue to maintain it. In this way, the cost of maintenance will not only not increase, but will be reduced instead.</p>
<p>The contribution of colors to safety is not small. According to the statistics of a factory, the number of individual injuries was reduced by 40% after the modern color work was done well. As long as the lighting is improved, colors will make a factory safer. Westinghouse engineers say their philosophy is to make "every danger visible." When dangerous parts are marked with striking colors, when continuous seams are marked with obvious boundaries, and when dark places and corridors are brightened with highly reflective colors, the safety index of this factory will be significantly increased.</p>

<h3>Introduction to Business Administration</h3>
<p>— Xu Baiyi</p>
<p>Employee Psychology</p>
<p>If the work we do requires great observation, such as manufacturing watches, light bulbs, etc., then the tests we need to do should be aimed at observation.</p>
<p>The implementation of this test can be divided into two types. One is to test the existing employees. After checking the effect of the test, we can know what kind of training they need. The other type of test must be passed when hiring employees.</p>
<p>Speaking of this, we can easily think that general Chinese enterprises do not have detailed testing work when hiring employees. If they are hiring an office clerk, then at most they will ask him to write an article in Chinese or English. In places where chemistry or arithmetic is needed, then they will ask a few exam questions about chemistry or arithmetic, and then add an oral test and physical examination. As for the person's character, they can only observe some during the oral test, but how can the person in charge of the exam see a person's character in a few minutes? If it is in a factory, then hiring workers will not have strict tests either. Sometimes the foreman is responsible for finding suitable workers to take on the work.</p>
<p>There is also a bad habit among Chinese people, which is a great obstacle to the operation of business organizations, that is, hiring private individuals or using recommendations. As a result, people are generally embarrassed to offend others, and many rules are difficult to implement. In many larger enterprises, there are personnel departments (or personnel management committees) that specialize in managing personnel matters. Under this circumstance, the competent authorities can avoid many difficulties, because when relatives and friends recommend employees, they can notify the personnel department to handle it. In fact, it can also receive better work efficiency.</p>
<p>When testing, the following points should be studied in terms of psychology. The tests can also be based on the following points as standards, and can be increased or decreased in combination with the work done: (1) honesty, (2) loyalty, (3) concentration, (4) cooperation with colleagues, (5) ambition, (6) creativity, (7) thoroughness in doing things, (8) agility, (9) management talent, (10) memory.</p>
<p>Each point will be discussed in detail next time.</p>

<h3>The Genius Woman Poet of Africa: A Biography of Phillis Wheatley</h3>
<p>— Lu Shixiong</p>
<p>Throughout history, the success of poets has often been attributed to their environment and material resources, whether growing up in a land of picturesque mountains and clear waters or emerging from a family with a strong scholarly tradition. At the very least, they had access to some form of education, enabling them to observe nature and generate emotions, express themselves through beautiful language, and give voice to their inner thoughts through poetry. Therefore, while poets were not necessarily from wealthy and idle classes, they were generally able to live a comfortable life.</p>
<p>Now, the female poet I want to talk about, "Phillis Wheatley," lacked all the above qualifications, yet she became a poet of her generation in England and America. The background of this female poet was that of a very pitiable person. She was born in Senegal, Africa. In 1761, she was brought to Boston, USA, on a slave ship and sold. A tailor named "Wheatley" bought her to serve his ailing wife. "Phillis Wheatley's" original name was "Phillis." Because she was sold into the "Wheatley" tailor's family, she added "Wheatley" to her name. As she was kidnapped and sold at a young age, she was also unsure of her age, estimating it to be between 1753 and 1754. Although this female poet was like a wildflower blooming in a desolate land, her temperament was gentle and docile, intelligent and quick-witted, and innocent and lively, making her very endearing. Therefore, she was well-liked by the younger members of the tailor's family. The children had no concept of master and servant, so they mingled together, living a very democratic life.</p>
<p>At that time, although "Phillis Wheatley" performed humble tasks, her budding interest in literature naturally emerged without anyone's instruction. In her spare time, she would often take charcoal and scribble on the walls, trying to write. At that time, she couldn't recognize a single character. When the mistress of the house saw this, she was not only without blame but also amazed by her talent for learning, so she had her study with the mistress's daughter. In just under a year and a half, "Phillis Wheatley" was already able to recite and understand the most difficult and profound passages in the Bible.</p>
<p>"Phillis Wheatley" lit a lamp at night after work to read and write. With her extraordinary talent, she was able to write fluent English by the age of eight. At the same time, because of her kind personality, like a lamb, many female friends formed literary connections with her, and letters were frequently exchanged. Her daily writing, from a young age, was not in the style of rigid, lengthy articles. She loved to write short, fragmented pieces. Her works were often rich in poetic sentiment. At the young age of fourteen, she was already able to compose very beautiful poems, and her works were comparable to those of the great English poets. She immersed herself in the study of ancient Greek and Latin poetry. In a short poem she composed about "Washington," there was a strong resemblance to the style of the great Roman poet "Virgil."</p>
<p>When "Phillis Wheatley" was nineteen, her unique creations and other works were acutely emotional, with profound, intense, sharp, delicate, and passionate descriptions, excelling in all aspects. Her output was prolific and widely circulated. In the mid-eighteenth century, she was known as the Poet Laureate of Boston. The extent of her reputation can be imagined. In addition, she was well-versed in astronomy, geography, Eastern history, and various classics. Therefore, her position in the academic world at that time was also renowned, ranking among the first-class scholars. Once, because she was ill, the doctor advised her to take a sea voyage, so she sailed to London. Due to her poetic fame, she received a warm welcome from the local mayor, nobles, and celebrities while in London. During the eighteenth century, feudal ideas in Europe were quite strong, and class distinctions were deeply entrenched. However, "Phillis Wheatley," with her background as an African female slave, received preferential treatment from the dignitaries, which was as difficult as ascending to heaven. The status of poets and the power of literature are truly extraordinary! "Phillis Wheatley's" husband was named "John Peters." This man had worked as a barber and grocer and had also studied law. Because he was intelligent, he knew a little about everything. People even called him Dr. Peters. His temperament was strangely lazy, and he achieved nothing. Therefore, when this female poet married him, it was, if not like a phoenix following a crow, at least an unhappy and unpleasant union. She had three children, all of whom died prematurely. The couple spent few years together before John Peters died. "Phillis Wheatley," in the midst of cruel fate and sorrowful emotions, also shortened her lifespan and died on December 5, 1784, at the age of about thirty-one.</p>
<p>Looking back on "Phillis Wheatley's" life, she never received a formal education, but she became a great poet admired throughout history. This was partly due to her unique talent and partly due to her own diligent study. The American Young Women's Christian Association recently wrote an article praising this great female poet in commemoration. The author translates her biography with the humble intention of encouraging both myself and out-of-school youth!</p>
<h3>Flowing Clouds and Running Water</h3>
<p>— Xu Shiqi</p>
<p>The creation of scenery in traditional Chinese painting emphasizes ethereal vastness and expresses secluded feelings. It has a considerable distance from the realization of life's realm. The artist's perception of natural space and color is both spiritually connected and formally detached, possessing his personal style and artistic conception. The three masters, Jian Jiang, Shi Tao, and Qu Shan, all painted Mount Huang, each depicting its majestic and secluded landscapes, and each capturing the view of flowing clouds and running water. Qu Shan's portrayal of pine trees is like that of a reclusive hermit, proud and aloof. Shi Tao's splashed ink creates a landscape of smoky clouds within a small space, conveying a myriad of appearances. Jian Jiang's writing is pure, unique, cold, and elegant, like an orchid growing in a secluded valley, devoid of any artificiality, completely unpolluted.</p>
<p>Recently, I observed Mr. He Tianjian's landscape paintings. He learns from nature but possesses a unique understanding, creating works that are majestic, profound, simple, and independent. He corrects the mediocre and imitative style of modern Jiangnan artists, not confined by objects, revering what he values, and able to express his inner spirit. His monumental works, such as "Map of Restored Rivers and Mountains," "Map of Mountain Passes," and "Deep in Mount Huang," are ingeniously conceived, magnificent, and exquisitely crafted. He is full of imagination and possesses the spirit of a poet, using brush and ink to express his suppressed emotions. The more he explores, the more skillful he becomes (interpreting "exhaustively searching and widely collecting"), rather than becoming skillful only after becoming impoverished.</p>
<p>"There is this realm in the heart, not necessarily existing in the world. There is this realm under the brush, not necessarily existing in ancient times." His attitude towards artistic creation can be grasped through these few words. "Perilous Cliffs and Flying Waterfalls," "Evening Mist at Mountain Passes," "Autumn Dawn at Stone Gate of Mount Hui," a total of over two hundred pieces, "The heart is like a vast valley storing boundless things, freely searching for ten thousand unique wonders; this is also a landscape in the chest, people will suspect it is the autumn of Jianmen." This is his inscription. Ten years of meticulous work are gathered in one place. I personally appreciate it and express it with joy, to inform the connoisseurs in Shanghai today, where the spirit is exhausted and the art scene is barren.</p>
<h3>Memorandum of Stupid Things</h3>
<p>— By Carnegie, Translated by Shi Xiaoyun</p>
<p>"There are three hardest things: steel, diamonds, and knowing yourself."</p>
<p>(The author of this article, Dale Carnegie, is a contemporary American expert on self-cultivation and dealing with people. His articles are vivid and fluent, deeply loved by the public. Many of his works have been translated into Chinese. This article was originally published in the October issue of Your Life magazine. The author's method of self-cultivation is very worthy of our emulation).</p>
<p>In my personal briefcase, I always keep a small notebook: Memorandum of Stupid Things. It records many of the stupid things I have done. Month after month passes, I have never stopped or paused. Sometimes I instruct my secretary to record them for me, but some things are so stupid that I am afraid he will laugh at me, so I usually copy them myself.</p>
<p>I prepared the "Memorandum of Stupid Things" fifteen years ago. In these long years, if I could completely and honestly record my stupid things, then my briefcase would have burst open long ago. – Indeed, as Hubbard said, "Everyone is a fool for at least five minutes a day, intelligence is completely useless at that time."</p>
<p>Every time I reread these records, I always get great inspiration and assistance. Its value is far beyond any of King Solomon's proverbs. It helped me solve one of the biggest problems: the method of self-control.</p>
<p>On July 31, 1944, a celebrity died in a drugstore in New York. His name was Howard, and his death shocked the entire market because he was a leader in American finance.</p>
<p>I am very familiar with him. He used to be a member of my public speaking class. He had not received a formal education. His career began as a clerk in a village store. Later, he worked late at Carnegie Steel Company, but twenty-two years later, he was the manager of United States Steel Corporation (this is the world's largest steel company, reorganized from Carnegie Company—translator). He already had status and power.</p>
<p>One night, he lectured in our public speaking class. In his words, he revealed one of the reasons for his success.</p>
<p>"For many years, I have always kept a memorandum recording my daily actions. On Saturday nights, I have a time for self-examination. During this time, I review the work of the past week."</p>
<p>"After dinner, I leave the dining room alone, open the memorandum, and recall the meetings, discussions, and gatherings of the week. I ask myself: What mistakes have I made? What valuable things have I done? – What methods can I use to make myself more successful?"</p>
<p>"Sometimes this recollection makes me feel deeply unhappy. Sometimes I am even shocked by the stupid things I have done. Of course, year after year, these stupid things gradually decrease. Now I am quite satisfied with my progress. This method of self-examination has really benefited me infinitely."</p>
<p>Howard's method was probably learned from writing to Franklin. The only difference is that Franklin reviewed himself every night, not necessarily on the weekend. He found that he had thirteen serious shortcomings, three of which were: wasting time, nitpicking, and liking to argue with people.</p>
<p>He knew very well that if he did not remove these defects, he would never have greater achievements. So at the beginning of each week, he would choose one of the shortcomings to fight for a week. The next week, he would challenge another shortcoming. By the time the Sunday bell rang, he had overcome his opponent.</p>
<p>Franklin continued such battles for two years, no wonder he succeeded as a great man beloved by generations. But he wrote: "There are three hardest and most difficult things: steel, diamonds, and knowing yourself."</p>
<p>Suppose someone scolds you as a "fool"—what will you do? Angry? Scold back? Or fight? Here is a story of Lincoln.</p>
<p>Stanton was Lincoln's chief of staff. Once, he angrily scolded Lincoln as a complete "blockhead" because the president signed a troop withdrawal treaty to please a selfish politician. This was a serious mistake. Stanton refused the order.</p>
<p>When Lincoln learned of this, he said very calmly: "If Stanton really scolded me as a fool, then I must be a fool. He never makes mistakes. Let me review it again."</p>
<p>Lincoln went to see Stanton. He was persuaded by Stanton, so he canceled the order. Lincoln always welcomed serious and sincere comments very much.</p>
<p>We should also welcome such accusations because we really cannot guarantee that three-quarters of what we do is right. Therefore, President Roosevelt once said such words in the White House, and Einstein did not dare to have such expectations. He said that ninety-nine out of his hundred conclusions were often wrong! What is there to be ashamed of about our stupid things and worth hiding without correcting?</p>

<p>Memories of Xiashi</p>
<p>If I hadn't heard the passengers in the car talking to each other that this was "Xiashi," I would have suspected that what I was seeing was definitely not the Xiashi town I had visited before. However, then I saw a mountain peak with a pagoda on top, and like the surrounding area, the scene was very desolate. I remembered more than ten years ago when I went from Hangzhou to Shanghai and got off the bus here to see my late brother. Originally, Xiashi had no position on the map, and there were four places with the same name: Shilu Gorge, which hinders the river crossing in Jinji, Yellow River, is called Xiashi, and the northern path of the Huai River through the mountain gorge is called Xiashi, as well as the Xiashi Pass in Henan. This place is neither a river nor a Huai River, but only the confluence of the Qiantang River's tributaries, perhaps resembling the form of a water gorge, and also being the first town of Hangzhou, it has become a hub for merchants. Therefore, the Second District Business Tax Bureau of Zhejiang Province was located in Xiashi, which was my late brother's former post. At that time, there were indeed many masts at the mouth of the water. My late brother accompanied me for an entire evening, and we climbed the mountain peak, listening to the distant bell sounds, lingering for a long time. Now, after revisiting it more than ten years later, Xiashi is so desolate that I don't recognize it. Withered grass, dilapidated walls, and not a single sail in sight. Where is the first town of our Zhejiang? Of course, it is not easy to recover in just one year. Moreover, the more places where industry and commerce compete, the deeper they have suffered from enemy destruction. And it has been many years since my late brother's death. Following Wu Jizha's words: "The bones and flesh return to the earth, that is fate, but the soul and spirit go everywhere," my late brother died in the chaos of war, and his bones were buried in a foreign land in chaos. "A mass of depression in the chest is difficult to call for wine, a covering of mountains and rivers is temporarily stopped." I remember singing this elegy, and my mood became even more gloomy. Looking at the old mountain peak, I don't know its name, I don't know if it is called Shenshan? (According to Shenshan, Shen Jing of the Song Dynasty was buried northeast of Haining)</p>

<h3>An Inch of Mountains and Rivers, an Inch of Blood 89</h3>
<p>— Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>And since he risked his life for this trip, it would be too unreasonable not to leave a souvenir. Now back to the original topic, Brother Hu wanted to eliminate the root of the evil of the Tongxian pseudo-autonomous region, Yin Ni. If he hadn't killed that Sasaki Gen, he might have tried it with plenty of time. Now even searching for where he is hiding is difficult. This goal can only be temporarily abandoned.</p>
<p>Such huge military equipment must contain a huge amount of ammunition. If he could find it, it would not be difficult to destroy some of it; but when he just discovered the power generation room, he realized that there were many basements here, and they must be large-scale buildings. However, where to start exploring in a short time? This plan also had to be abandoned. Another option was to set a fire and burn down one or two of these large buildings, which would serve as a warning to the arrogant Japanese army, but none of the buildings he had seen were made of cement and steel. What could they use to burn them down? This was also a fantasy.</p>
<p>These gasoline drums, he was just afraid they were used empty drums, otherwise, there would be an article to do. Thinking of this, he explained to Brother Hu, to check those round drums first. They explored forward one in front of the other as before; in nine minutes, they reached their destination. At a glance, he could see that this was a gasoline terminal. In addition to the piles of oil drums, there were also many pressurized pump devices for refueling. Looking north in a row, he couldn't see clearly, but estimated that there were at least about twenty or thirty of them. He tried knocking on the oil drums, and they were indeed full of oil.</p>
<p>He further inspected the ground, which was paved with cement; needless to say, it must be a very strong underground oil pool. In a short time, and without tools, there was no way to move it. Behind the oil drums, separated by five or six zhang, was piled a coal ridge, stretching north, he didn't know how long. When they reached the foot of this coal pile, they measured the top of the pile, estimating it to be at least four or five zhang high. Fortunately, the slope of the coal pile was not very steep, and it was all piled up with large coal blocks, making it easy to climb. He told Brother Hu to go to the top of the pile first to see the situation; because they wanted to start working here, they had to understand the local situation first, so they could avoid it if there was an alarm. He hoped that this place was like the east side, with roads, forests, stone walls, and even a small stream outside the walls.</p>
<p>When Brother Hu heard him tell him to go up the coal pile to observe, he just answered softly and, like an ape, used his hands and feet together, and quickly reached the top of the pile and lay there. He was estimating what method should be used to destroy these gasoline drums when he suddenly heard a soft hiss, Brother Hu gave the alarm. He ducked and looked in the direction where Brother Hu was lying, and saw Brother Hu waving at him, telling him to come up.</p>
<p>Was this area of coal ridges really just piled with coal blocks? That was far from the truth. He felt that these coal blocks were piled too neatly along the slope of the coal pile, making it inevitably suspicious. Just as he reached the top, Brother Hu gestured, pointing to the slope to the west and quietly said, "Look!..." This place could be said to be completely dark, the clouds in the sky were extremely low, and the pile was full of coal blocks. What was he supposed to look at? But Brother Hu's pair of night owl eyes must have seen something.</p>
<p>At this time, Brother Hu had already gone down the western coal slope. So he followed his route. Just as he got down to two-thirds of the way, he suddenly found a wide groove indented on the side of his foot. Straining his eyes, he took a closer look and gradually distinguished it. This groove was actually a neat gun emplacement, with most of the gun barrel buried in the coal pile, but the muzzle was pointing west, slightly southwest. Wasn't that southwest point the area around Beiping?</p>

<h3>Ramblings by Lamplight</h3>
<p>— Shaofu</p>
<p>Chinese people who work for foreigners, including foreign firms, tram companies, ordinary shops, etc., generally harbor some resentment towards their superiors; this resentment is more fully expressed as patriotic fervor during strikes, which is quite touching to onlookers. However, when you are riding the tram, paying your water and electricity bills, or shopping in foreign stores, they put on a "quasi-foreigner" face, repeatedly saying: "Chinese people are always making a mess, so annoying!"</p>
<p>Amidst the voices of increased donations, taxes, prices, and a sluggish market, the authorities repeatedly deny the rumors, saying: "There is absolutely no such thing as issuing Sun Yat-sen notes. It is probably caused by the sensitive speculation of some merchants." From this, we can see a kind of hope among the merchants in despair; but as the recent economic situation has developed, after prominent figures in the business community make the usual pronouncements, they shake their heads and say: "We have no hope at all!"</p>
<p>These past two days, the High Procuratorate is investigating and interrogating "pro-Japanese Chinese film" actors who defected to the enemy. However, reports say that Zhang Shankun, the boss of "pro-Japanese Chinese film," is still living comfortably in Hong Kong, managing several private film companies, and even sent people to Shanghai and other places to invite actors; it is said that he is able to be so carefree entirely due to the protection of "a certain dignitary." Since the dignitary can bestow favors on those who are left behind, why not simply grant amnesty to those charming "stars" as well, allowing their boss and colleagues to cooperate again, singing and dancing in peace, so that "Spring River" no longer "harbors regret," and the dignitary will be "eternally famous!"</p>
<p>Shanghai has been very energetic these past few months: starting with the enthusiastic election of Miss Shanghai, followed by mourning the death of the panda, opposing the import of merchant ships with the Japanese flag, the opening of the chrysanthemum exhibition, and up to the recent announcement by the Urban Planning Committee that Shanghai will become the world's largest city, our hearts are filled with light and excitement. But now, when we walk on the streets, there are still many places that are full of holes and garbage; however, dreaming of the beauty of "Shanghai soon becoming the largest city," we seem to have become very forgetful again!</p>
<h3>Bayer Trademark vs. Zhang Tianshi's "Magic Talisman"</h3>
<p>— Mamo</p>
<p>Among the enemy assets received after the victory, in addition to those originally belonging to Japanese residents and soldiers, the assets of German merchants, such as "Defu's" pigments and dyes, and "Bayer's" Western medicines, etc., can probably be listed as the second largest number. However, since they are inventory, no matter how much there is, there will eventually be a day when they are sold out. After a year of continuous bidding for "Bayer" pharmaceuticals, the newspapers recently said that the authorities, seeing that the inventory is about to run out, are considering the issue of using the "Bayer" trademark rights. At first, it was said that it would be reserved for use by the government or government-run institutions, but recently it has been said that it is being considered to be given to the private sector. However, the question is not who will use it, but how it should be used and whether it should be used at all.</p>
<p>It is a fact that the "Bayer" trademark has strong credibility and a wide market in China. It is not an exaggeration to say that no Western medicine merchant in China has surpassed it in the past century. However, a trademark is just a symbol. In the past, the "Bayer" trademark was merely a mark of its excellent, fresh, and reliable technology, raw materials, and equipment. "Bayer" does not use its trademark like Zhang Tianshi uses a magic talisman to cure people's diseases.</p>
<p>Moreover, today, the original research and technical personnel of the German "Bayer" have long been recruited by the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union, respectively, and the "Bayer" raw materials stored in Shanghai have been used up. Now, there is no hope of importing them from Germany again, and the original assembly equipment is old and broken and can only be supplemented locally. In short, the "Bayer" in China and the disintegrated "Bayer" in Germany will be difficult to connect tightly in the future.</p>
<p>Then, isn't the so-called "trademark usage right" just the five letters "BAYER"?</p>
<p>I think: For example, if "Bayer" has a special method for manufacturing "aspirin," then wouldn't it be great for the government to publicly grant it to the Chinese new medicine industry at no cost? And if (in fact, it's not "if") China is already able to make equally good "aspirin" on its own, then why must Chinese goods be launched on the market under the Bayer trademark? Is it possible to increase "credit" by signing in foreign languages on Chinese banknotes? Don't forget: "No science, no national defense," and under this principle, this clearly includes: "No pharmaceutical industry, no national defense," of course, "aspirin" is a military necessity in war! Should we encourage Chinese people to manufacture it? Or should we use foreign trademarks to suppress the budding of the Chinese pharmaceutical industry?</p>
<p>The question not only includes the establishment of China's medical and pharmaceutical industry but also includes the establishment of Chinese people's self-confidence and self-esteem!</p>
<p>Grain Administration in Jiangxi Province</p>
<h3>It's Better to Work in Grain Management Than Politics</h3>
<p>— Xiaotian</p>
<p>"It's better to work in grain management than politics." This saying was most prevalent among the people in the rear areas during the War of Resistance. Unexpectedly, the joke "It's better to work in grain management than politics" is also prevailing in Jiangxi today. This is indeed a strange phenomenon in our country.</p>
<p>Since Cheng Maoxing, the director of the Jiangxi Provincial Farmland and Grain Administration, committed suicide, followed by the case on the 29th of last month where Zou Bingnan, the head of the Xinyu Lianzhi station of the Gan Provincial Storage and Transportation Office, drowned himself in the Zhang River (as reported in the Xin Kai Bao on the 7th), it was because Station Chief Zou had embezzled and owed more than 40,000 dan of surplus grain. Unable to repay this huge amount (estimated to be over 70 million yuan at the current price), and with government grain inspectors pressing him relentlessly, he chose death to repay his debt. It's quite telling about the grain administration in Jiangxi that a small station chief could embezzle over 40,000 dan of surplus grain. I cannot help but sigh for the politics of saving the country!</p>
<p>Originally, Jiangxi had already been impoverished and exhausted after six years of bandit suppression and eight years of the War of Resistance. Although the National Government had ordered the exemption of farmland taxes this year, which is certainly something to be grateful for, the disguised grain levies, military grain levies, and prisoner grain levies have not alleviated the suffering of the people. They are like sharp blades aimed at the dying populace. Corrupt officials manipulate the system from top to bottom, and cases of illegal sales emerge endlessly. The so-called storage station chiefs and warehouse directors are all wealthy, using the people's hard-earned money for extravagant and licentious pleasures. Hence, the joke "It's better to work in grain management than politics, and it's better to be a prostitute than to work in grain management" came into being.</p>
<p>Life Sketches</p>
<h3>Beyond Money</h3>
<p>— Li Baozhen</p>
<p>Waiting in vain for the trolleybus on Beijing Road and Jiangxi Road, I hailed a pedicab. I specified a round trip to Caojiadu for 5,000 yuan in legal tender. Coincidentally, another young woman who couldn't squeeze onto the trolleybus also needed to go to Gordon Road. Since I had already chartered the pedicab for a round trip, I invited her to join me. However, the driver demanded an extra 2,000 yuan on top of the 5,000. The young woman naturally refused, and they started yelling at each other. In the end, she jumped out, leaving me to go alone. I couldn't help but feel a bit worried about this driver's temper. Not long after, another pedicab driver behind us accidentally broke his canopy. He got out of the pedicab to take a look, drove for a while, and finally got out again, grabbed the other driver, and berated him severely. Only after the passersby intervened did he stop. I felt even more apprehensive about his temper.</p>
<p>I waited for quite some time in Caojiadu and then waited for a long time at Hongren Hospital. Finally, he asked me to increase the fare by 2,000 yuan, and I immediately agreed to add 1,000. Then I asked him about his circumstances. He said that renting a pedicab cost 4,000 yuan per eight-hour shift, and buying one cost 1.5 million, which he couldn't afford. As he lamented his plight, his face softened, his eyes became gentler, and it seemed that my value in his eyes had also changed. Because it was lunchtime, I asked him to take me to the Da Zhonghua Restaurant, paid him the full 6,000 yuan, and suggested, "I'm going upstairs to eat now and will be down in 20 minutes. Didn't you say you haven't eaten? Go eat something too. After you're done, can you take me to the Bund? But if you have a good fare, go ahead and take it; don't wait for me."</p>
<p>To my surprise and delight, he was indeed sitting there waiting for me. And he seemed very happy to pull me away. When we arrived at the Bund, I waited at the Bank of Communications for ten minutes before he took me to Jardine House. I handed him 1,000 yuan, and he accepted it without a word.</p>
<p>I think I know why his attitude changed. When he was cursing and shouting, it was his expression of struggling to survive. He wanted to live, so he wanted money—by any means necessary. But once he realized that there are things in the world beyond money—a little sympathy, a little sincerity, a little politeness, and a little kindness—he entered the cultural era from the savage era. The instinct for self-defense was no longer needed, replaced by gentleness and even the joy of work. My exhausted compatriots, how I wish I possessed the wealth of the world so that each of you wouldn't have to suffer, and how I wish each of you could live in selfless love!</p>
<h3>Myth</h3>
<p>— Qian Fanfu</p>
<p>Reading the news lately feels like reading mythology.</p>
<p>The myth arises in Guangzhou: when discovered, it was a "golden brick"; when tested, it turned into a "copper brick"; recently, when publicly auctioned, it was renamed "gold brick."</p>
<p>In the past, I worried about government officials: the official career is full of dangerous situations, personnel changes are frequent, positions are insecure, and one's job is precarious.</p>
<p>Today, I seem to need to congratulate them: it turns out they are all merchants who know how to do business.</p>
<p>When in power, they are officials, with unmatched authority; when out of power, they become merchants, with enough wealth to last a lifetime.</p>
<p>"Official" and "merchant"; "bureaucrat" and "capital"—it seems they are inextricably linked! Heh, ha!</p>
<h3>More on Occupational Insurance</h3>
<p>— Ji Shui</p>
<p>About half a month ago, I wrote a short article titled "Protecting Salary Earners, Promoting Occupational Insurance." I originally thought it was just a drop of water in the ocean, disappearing in the river of articles without any "response." Unexpectedly, Mr. Chen Songyao, a military officer who had achieved success and was about to retire, sent me a letter full of light and warmth. He is willing to join me in taking on the responsibility of promoting this cause, and I am happy to work with him in a practical manner.</p>
<p>Now, I will tell everyone my ideas first. If there are any aspects that cannot be implemented, please send a letter to point them out!</p>
<p>1.  Solicit friends with the spirit of "Everyone for me, and I for everyone," at least thirty people, the more the better. Everyone should unite, fulfilling the obligations that should be fulfilled and enjoying the rights that should be enjoyed.</p>
<p>2.  Friends who agree should contribute one, two, three, or four percent of their income each month, depending on the amount of income.</p>
<p>3.  Elect two friends who are capable of handling matters without taking a salary, one responsible for managing finances and the other responsible for introducing jobs. Their role is simply to connect and entrust work.</p>
<p>Salary earners who share the same ideals, why not join us!</p>
<p>Common Sense Quiz</p>
<h3>Secrets of the Dressing Table: Perms, Perfume, Cold Cream</h3>
<p>— Ding Yichang</p>
<p>"Free Talk" has published two common sense quizzes. Those were all relatively fresh "hard" questions. This time, let's change direction and guess the "secrets" on a woman's dressing table. However, it is still based on scientific viewpoints to propose questions and solicit answers, and it is not the kind of romantic story like "peeking at makeup" or "stealing a look at painted eyebrows." I hope every reader can answer six or more questions correctly.</p>
<p>(1) Hair is permed into curves and waves, fluffy and loose. Besides the new-fashioned so-called "cold perm" which uses chemical drugs to make the hair undergo chemical changes and become curly, ordinary perms use charcoal fire or electric heat to change the hair:</p>
<p>A. By using heat to cause a physical change in the hair first;</p>
<p>B. By using electromagnetic waves to prevent the hair from straightening;</p>
<p>C. By using the evaporation of oils to prevent the hair from returning to its original state.</p>
<p>(2) The fragrant oily "hair wax" applied to the hair, its main ingredient is:</p>
<p>A. "Vaseline" extracted from mineral oil;</p>
<p>B. Glycerin;</p>
<p>C. Very sticky waxes.</p>
<p>(3) Many ladies who pay attention to makeup apply a layer of liquid "toner" that is closest to the skin, whether it is milky white or flesh-colored. Its main ingredient is nothing more than glycerin, because glycerin:</p>
<p>A. Can stimulate skin secretion, making it more delicate;</p>
<p>B. Can bleach pigments in skin cells;</p>
<p>C. It cannot evaporate, so the skin is often moisturized.</p>
<p>(4) Next, what are the main ingredients of cosmetics such as "cold cream," "vanishing cream," or "face cream" that everyone loves to use in cold weather? It is:</p>
<p>A. Snow-white lead powder;</p>
<p>B. Stearic acid;</p>
<p>C. Vaseline.</p>
<p>(5) Among the three types of main raw materials listed below, which one is more ideal for high-quality face powder, not to mention inferior ones?</p>
<p>A. Lead-based white compounds;</p>
<p>B. Zinc-based white compounds;</p>
<p>C. Starch-based or calcium-based white compounds.</p>
<p>(6) The curved "eyebrow pencil" drawn on the "windows of the soul" looks the same as an ordinary pencil, but in reality, it is closer to:</p>
<p>A. The "copying pencil" used in the office;</p>
<p>B. The crayon used by elementary school students;</p>
<p>C. The most expensive black ink used to print banknotes.</p>
<p>(7) How can a good solid "lipstick" be applied smoothly to the lips as desired? Because:</p>
<p>A. It contains a special "solvent" sufficient to dissolve the red dye;</p>
<p>B. Applying it is no different from a painter applying paint;</p>
<p>C. The temperature of the skin on the lips is sufficient to soften the oily ingredients it contains.</p>
<p>(8) Some of the most expensive and beautiful cosmetic advertisements say, "Our products contain 'hormones' or 'endocrine' substances, which can be absorbed by the skin, stimulate the skin, and keep you feeling young forever." From a scientific point of view, these words are completely:</p>
<p>A. Groundless nonsense to confuse and push products to the market;</p>
<p>B. 100% reasonable;</p>
<p>C. Possibly effective but not necessarily effective, and even if effective, it is very wasteful and contains risks.</p>
<p>(9) "Nail polish" such as "Cutex" applied to fingertips and even toenails has a strong banana smell when the bottle is opened because it contains:</p>
<p>A. The organic solvent "ketone";</p>
<p>B. "Banana essence" made from brewed bananas;</p>
<p>C. All kinds of "essences" tasted when eating ice cream.</p>
<p>(10) Some perfumes used by modern women smell from dozens of feet away and last for weeks. The most common ingredient of this fragrance comes from:</p>
<p>A. Synthetic compounds of organic chemistry;</p>
<p>B. Distillation residues of various fragrant flowers;</p>
<p>C. A mixture of musk and sandalwood.</p>
<p>Answers will be revealed tomorrow.</p>
