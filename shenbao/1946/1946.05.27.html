<p>〔中央社蘇州通訊〕僞南京政府巨奸汪逆兆銘之姜陳璧君，經軍事委員會解送蘇高院偵査審訊，於四月二十二日判決，處無期徒刑，褫奪公權終身，全部財　，除酌留家屬必須生活費外，沒收，陳逆聆判，當庭表示不服，惟不欲覆判，其女汪文恂代母上訴，聲請覆判，蘇高院亦具呈覆核，茲經最高法院於五月十七日判決，主文云：「原判決核准，仍處無期徒刑，」覆判書業已到蘇，已送逢被吿，定期移送獅子口江蘇第三監獄執行，一代女奸從此終身監禁。茲將最高法院覆判書原文探誌於後：</p>
<p>最高法院特種刑事判決，三十五年度京特覆第一三九號。被吿陳璧君，女，年五十六歲，住廣州市法政路三十號。</p>
<p>右列被吿因漢奸案經江蘇高等法院於中華民國三十五年四月二十二日判決，送請覆判，本院判決如左：</p>
<p>（主文）原判決核准。</p>
<p>（理由）本件被吿陳璧君，係已故汪逆兆銘之妻，原任中國國民黨中央監察委員，中日戰事發生後，初隨汪逆前往重慶，嗣因我國初期戰事失利，汪逆意志薄弱，竟勾結日酋近衛文灣，密與媾和，被吿亦參與謀議，民國二十七年十二月，隨同汪逆自重慶潛赴越南河內，先派陳逆公博等至香港發表艷電，以響應近衛主張之和平三原則，旋偕在逆由河內至香港，轉往上海與敵寇商訂中日和平基礎方案，至民國二十九年三月三十日遂組織偽國民政府於南京，在逆自任僞主席，被吿則充任僞國民黨中央監察委員，及偽中央政治委員會委員，並奉派指導聯絡西南各省僞黨政軍事宜，爰與其胞弟即已故僞廣東省主席陳耀祖，在敵寇矢崎，酒井等指揮之下，處理粤政，直至敵寇投降，始行解職等情，迭經自白不諱，核與陳逆公博，褚逆民誼，在另案之陳述，均無不符，並有獲案之特派狀及敵軍特務機關與廣東省政府發給之身份證，暨陳逆耀祖以「崖」「華」暗號，向被告報吿及請示之電報，足資證明，其爲通謀敵國，圖謀反抗本國，事實已極顯著。被吿所持爲抗辯者，無非謂汪逆初本贊同抗戰，嗣因見戰事無法支持，中國不可收拾，而和平時機又已到來，遂仍本救國救民之素志，毅然主和，乃屢經建議，中央迄未採納，故不得已離渝，與日寇商討和平條件，其任務比之抗戰，尤爲複雜艱鉅，至於組織僞國民政府，係因當時北方有臨時政府，南方有維新政府，事權不能統一，人民處於水深火熱之中，故不得不有此舉。觀於汪逆不敢以主席自居，而以代理主席名義，主持政務，其無反抗本國之企圖，至爲明顯等語。本院査自七七事變後，我政府即以長期抗戰爲國策，迭經昭吿中外，乃汪逆意志薄弱，因見初期戰事失利，信心遽行動搖，不待政府之命令，或同意，竟擅自與敵酋言和，而所簽訂之中日和平基礎方案，又盡係喪權辱國之條件，其爲通謀敵國，雖百喙無以自解。且其時沿海各地，雖相繼淪陷，但我政府依然存在，乃汪逆竟於敵寇支持下，在南京組織偽府，與中央形成對峙之局，已不得謂無反抗本國之企圖。且核閱僞中央或治會議二十九年三月二十二日之決議案（見陝公博案內國民政府政詞之理論與實施）內有「國府還都後，重慶方面對內對外各種政令及條約，協定，契約等，一槪無效，所有軍隊，停戰待命，所有公務員，應於最近期內，來京報到」等語，則汪逆之組織僞府，固不僅圖謀反抗本國，且欲顚覆政府，被吿於汪逆之策劃，旣參與謀議，且分任要職，自無解於通謀敵國，圖謀反抗本國之罪責。抗辦意旨猶謂汪逆主和，旨在救國，殊屬自欺欺人。至謂被吿在廣東時，曾爲中央硏究院保全値物標本，及各種書籍甚多，且設法與敵寇交涉，平抑米價，曾拯救四十萬難民云云。無論所稱是否屬實，尙待證明，縱使非虛，亦於犯罪之成立，毫無影響，原處以被吿之行爲，應負担通謀敵國，圖謀反抗本國罪責，並以其汪　　　　　關係，因附和其夫之　　　　　　　而不自知，核與普通　罪　形，究有不同，尙非不可貸其一死。除關於被吿主持西南特工一節，認爲犯罪不能證明，免予慨議外，爰通以懲治漢奸條例第一條，第二條第一項第一款，第八條第一項，第九條，刑法第二條第一項前段，第二十八條，第三十七條第一項，處以無期徒刑，褫　公權終身，所有財產，除酌留家屬必須生活費外，全部沒收，於法尙無違誤，自應予以核准。</p>
<p>據上結論，應依特種刑事案件訴訟條例第二十條第一項第一款判決如主文。</p>

<p>〔美新聞處馬薩諸寒鼎斯潑林賽爾廿五日電〕國務院遠東司長范宣德，密那索太共和黨衆議員裘德及華盛頓民主黨衆議員特萊賽（後二人均爲中國問題　威），今晚在此間國民無綫電廣播中，討論山國在完成去年十二月莫斯科英美蘇外長會議所規定之「統一與民主之中國」過程內所面臨之種種問題，此項廣播節目爲國民廣播公司關於「吾人之外交政策」一連串節目之一，而爲木星期在外交政策協會會議中由此間所發之特別廣播，裘德與特萊賽二人所辯論者，爲最近國民黨與中共分裂之責任問題，范宣德則採取客觀之觀點，綜述美政府之政策與動機如下：</p>
<p>「吾人協助中國完成和平與統一之努力，並非由於利他主義，此種努力實爲促進國家及國際之利益，蓋鼓勵日本一九三一年之侵略者，即爲中國之不統一，而直接造成一九四一年吾人之全面戰爭。裘德議員指出，吾人必須主張中國之獨立及其領土與行政之完整一節，確有至理，但吾人不能僅賴開放門戶主義與九國公的，吾人必須積極努力，造成一强大而統一之中國，當前之問題，並不在於吾人勞力之結果是否將一蹴而完成中國之統一，而在於吾人是吾可以因鑒於種種顯然之困難而放棄吾人之努力·余以爲，依照馬歇爾元帥所主張，以和平方法爲中國統一而工作之政策，其反面即爲支助現政府以武力完成統一，但在武力統一中含有不受人歡迎之可能性，即中國將分成兩個對立之陣營，而使遠東一切建設性之政策，受到嚴重之阻碍。</p>
<p>「是以余深感吾人應以中立之地位，不袒護中國任何政黨，而支持馬歇爾將軍之艱巨工作，俾使中美及國際和平均獲莫大利益」。各廣播演講人均信任馬歇爾，因馬帥之工作已有進展，且曾表示渠必能協助中國解決目前之情形，各演講人復檢討中國內在困難，范宣德謂：去年十二月間之總統政策文吿發表前，總統曾與馬帥詳細討論，十二月間總統發表之政策文吿　：促使中國停止內爭，組織聯合政府及軍令統一，爲美國　華　主要目標。范宣德謂：當時即曾討論停止內戰問題，停戰協商於一月十日吿一段落，決定停止一切軍事衝突及軍事調動，同“，中國政府亦於重慶召開政治協商會議，各黨各派均派遣代表參加，其中計有共產黨及民生同盟等代表，詢以協商會曾獲致何種協議，范宣德答稱：商會決定組織聯合政府並制定民主憲法，保證人身·言論·集會及出版等自由，承認各政黨均有同等之合法地位，此外，並獲致關於舉行選舉促進地方自治之協議，政治協商會爲中國之全面性會議，實爲中國走向民主之一大進展。各演講人旋即提及協商會議後中國內爭重新抬頭之原因，裘德指稱：「中共一再遠反協議」，特萊賽則謂：「內爭之重新抬頭，兩方面均難辭其咎」，余認爲國民黨方面違反協議之處較多當爲事實。</p>
<p>特萊賽云：「余信美國應利用其一切力量及聲望，以促致中國國內和平，而不應於內戰期中偏袒任何一方」，裘德稱：「目前之局勢旣如此複雜，且有危及世界和平之勢，余信爲有關方面着想，如彼此能予同意，可於中國全境眞正統一實現之前，將中國東北暫時置於聯合國共同抵治之下」，特萊賽曰：「吾人不應忘却，中國東北人民　一九三一年以來則處於日人鐵蹄下，其時間之長、較中國任何人尤逾一倍，彼等渴望獲得自由，彼等不願再度爲外人所征服，即令彼等之新征服者爲華人，亦屬如是」。特萊賽旋稱：「停戰協定之破裂，實有重大理由，余認爲此事與世界之强國政治不能釐然劃分，倘諸强國未能通力合作，共謀和平，尤以美蘇二最大國家，若未能携手合作，吾人焉能希望中國或任何地傾向法西斯主義之輩，寗願放棄彼等多時以來所享有之任何權利」。范宣德旋檢討美蘇二國在華之政策，渠稱：「吾人之政策自屬視中央政府爲中國之合法政府，吾人　予中國之援助，係以中央政府爲對象，而非共產黨，蘇聯當局之政策亦復如是，此可向去年八月間蘇聯與中央政府簽署之協訂覘之，然無論如何，吾人界予中央政府之援助，宣無意令其用於內戰」。關於中國東北前日人工廠問題，范宣德稱：「吾人曾向蘇聯提出强硬抗議，反對搬移前日人在中國東北之工廠，渠等對戰利品另有一番解釋（渠等指此等工業爲戰利品），且全屬錯誤。處置前日人所營工廠，應受盟國全盤賠償協定所節制，此非屬於任何一國之事」。至於美國一般興論對中國未來所持態度，范宣德云：「美國輿論亟望中國能產生一民主聯合政府，並一致承認蘇聯應合作共訂一對中國及整個遠東之政策」。</p>

<h3 id="c16">鮑萊東來的任務 <a href="#c16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>杜魯鬥總統賠款問題專使鮑萊奉命前來遠東，實地調査朝鮮與我國東北的物資以及工業設備，已於昨日抵滬。按鮑氏於本月十日行抵東京時，曾向報界發表談話稱：「此次前來遠東，主要任務，乃在調査蘇聯搬走該區工業設備之範圍。中國與朝鮮境內以前日本所有全部資產，應歸各該國所有，此乃美國政策之目標」。由此可知鮑萊此來任務的重要。鮑萊啓程東來之前，美國與論界即認爲鮑萊的調査工作，將使美蘇兩國在遠東的經濟利益發生衝突。其後飽氏於十六日自朝鮮南部美軍佔領區進入朝鮮北部蘇軍佔領區，執行調査工作，二十四日復自漢城飛抵我國首都南京，訪問我國當局，洽商積極進行調査辦法，並向報界發表談話，率直表示：「東北重工業設備被蘇聯搬走一空，很難有物歸原處的希望」。他說這句話的時候，不免有些懊喪，我們聽了這句話，更加惆悵與失望。</p>
<p>關於東北問題，遠在開羅會議時，早已解決；在羅邱蔣三巨頭聯名發表的宣言中，曾公開宣佈中國東北以及台灣琉球交還中國；羅斯福總統返國後報吿開羅會議所決定的遠東百年大計，其中也有「將財產返還其原主」一項原則。所以我們在日本屈膝投降後，都以爲蘇軍撤退與東北交由中國政府接收，是沒有問題的，殊不知雅爾達密的早已存在，使我國恢復東北的主權，還要受到若干限制（一）闢大連爲國際港，蘇聯保有優越權利；旅順由蘇聯租用，作為海軍基地；（二）中東鐵路與南滿鐵路由中蘇共管，蘇聯保有優越權利。中國政府爲息事寗人計，乃依照雅爾達密的的規定，不惜償付重大代價，與蘇聯簽訂兩國友好條約、以期保全遠東的和平。但中蘇條約的墨瀋未乾，蘇聯在東北違約的行動，却已層出不窮。其最不可解的，就是蘇聯將東北重工業的設備搬走一空，只剩下一個空殻，讓我們去接收。據美國礦務專家估計，蘇聯負東北搬走的工業設備，至少値五萬萬美元，中國若欲補充這些設備，非有兩年不可。但是蘇聯採取這種行動，反謂「東北諸省所有曾爲關東軍服務之日本企業，應視為蘇軍戰利品。」這種强詞奪理的說法，顯無充分理由，且違反國際公法，無怪要引起我國的黃議和英美兩國的干涉。</p>
<p>先是，美國國務卿貝爾納斯於本年二月九日，分別照會中蘇兩國政府，聲明二事：（一）反對中蘇兩國共管東北工業，現兩國進行談判，不啻違背美國之「門戶開放　策；（二）東北工業與日本賠款問題，有密切關係，不能視為　　，而將其搬走一空。其後英國亦步美國後塵，向蘇聯提出同　　的交涉。但蘇聯始終置之不覆，於是英與蘇聯對於此一　　　陷於僵局。在英美方面，主張蘇軍在東北所搬走的工業備，應作爲日本賠款的資本；而在蘇聯則認此爲蘇軍的戰利品，可以搬走，至於所剩餘的工業，亦應由中蘇兩國共同經營。雙方各執一詞，不肯稍讓，形成遠東當前嚴重的國際問題。</p>
<p>至於我國對於此一問題的態度，早經外長王世杰向外宣佈：「中國抗戰最久，損失最大，故在日本對盟國總賠償額中，中國應享有優越比例數量；並應享有優先取得之一權。凡在中國境內之日本公私產業，均應視爲日本對華賠償之一部份。」同時中國對於蘇聯將東北工業視爲蘇軍的戰利品一層，也表示異議，並已正式通知英美兩國，曾獲得英美報界的好評。例如倫敦泰晤士報載稱：「吾人始終認爲中國旣慘遭日本侵略，且爲東北九省主權之保持者，故此項工業設備之合法保管人，舍中國莫屬。」英國工黨每日前鋒報也載稱：「此事調査之後，即可證明東北多數工廠，事實上非日本所有，而爲中國所有之合法產業。」由此可知，我國的立塲理直氣强，不容推翻的；我們希望鮑萊來華，後，能多多聽取我國朝野的意見。</p>
<p>我們且將法理的歷史的因素姑置不論，單單從經濟的角度去觀察，蘇聯搬走東北的工業設備，對於蘇聯本身亦非十分有利，不過一大堆廢銅爛鐵而己。但若不搬走，仍留原處，則對於當地經濟當有極大的裨益。所以鮑萊說：「美國欲使此種設備與物資，爲當地安全與世界和平而繼續生產；並相信此種設備如留原處，其價値如有一百分，一經移動，其價値將不及原來的十分之一。」蘇聯搬走東北的工業設備，實在是一件「損人不利己」的事情。鮑萊到東北實地調査之後，應該設法使「物歸原處，」以實現美國的主張，即必須便一切足以影響東北經濟的各種工業設備一律不許搬動。鮑萊說很難有物歸原處的希望，不免太悲觀了吧？事在人爲，六十二位美國名流學者不是在那裏大聲疾呼，要求廢棄雅爾達密約嗎？</p>
<p>要之，東北工業設備問題是日本賠欽問題中最重要的一環，英美與蘇聯對於此一問題的意見如不能商得一致，則日本賠款問題將更不易解決。最近朝鮮美蘇委員會討論南北兩佔領區的統一問題，又是不歡而散，美蘇兩國在遠東處處站在對立地位，顯而易見的了。這種可悲的局勢，如不設法挽救，則後患無窮，不堪設想。凡是熱望戰後遠東能和平相處的人們，莫不渴望美蘇兩國息爭，事事均能推誠相見，而不互相猜忌，則一切爭議都可迎刃而解。英國首相艾德禮昨天發表演說，爲世界和平呼籲，蘄求人類消除個人的自私，黨派的自私以及國家民族的自私。英美蘇三强苟能眞正如此，則國際間的合作，就不難實現。今日的遠東，有如今日的世界，問題的總結，完全在蘇聯的獨斷獨行，引起英美的不能信任，或至少不能諒解。美國前國務副卿威爾斯公然指摘遠東局勢的阮隉不安，完全由於美蘇未能成立諒解所致，尤爲一針見血之論。所以我們對於鮑萊東來，除了希望他能完成其任務而外，並盼望鮑氏對於促進美蘇兩國諒解，以打開目前遠東僵局，能多盡一些力，多做一些工作，不僅對遠東有利，而且對於世界和平也必有極大的裨益。</p>

<p>〔聯合紐倫堡廿五日電〕六個月前德國社　高級人員廿一名，以發動戰爭等罪開始受聯合國審訊，截至今日所記各國檢察官之發言，已不下二百五十萬字，呈案證據文件堆積如山，承審法官將一一過目，然後草擬判詞，決定各被告與六個團體之命運，及其在國社黨政府中之身份。判決後並無上訴機關，惟四國管制德國委員會有權减刑，並決定其在何時何地執行。參加審訊諸人於此案開始時，鮮有能知其進行將歷多少時日者。</p>
<p>推翻國際法　假使各國起訴書嚴格的限於戰爭罪及殘殺歐洲數百萬平民罪，則審訊時期可以大為縮短。乃聯合國於此次審訊中，將造成一種環境，推翻公認之國際公法與條約，而實行侵略戰爭者無論是否出於故意，亦一併列入。因此對於德國社主義作長期　訊，直追訴至廿五年前國社　產生之時，每一被告均被控參加擁護希特勒與發動侵略戰之陰謀。</p>
<p>侵略者有罪　在實質方面，聯合國擬證明實行侵略戰者為有罪，擁護發動侵略戰之人秉政者亦為有罪，其輔助侵略之全部機構，包括德內閣與參謀總部在內，均為犯罪團體。因此龐大之計劃，遂令審訊時間延長，對於德國戰前政治之大量證據，均須加以研究，且於無數戰爭罪行發生爭議之證據，常不能明定界限。惟此數千頁關於戰前納粹主義之證詞，為德人及全世界人一個重大敎訓，殆無人可以否認。人民如自願放棄其政治責任，而接受煽動仇恨與謀殺之宣傳不稍疑問，則其結果如何，可於此中覘之，是即為其敎訓所在。至於世界各國是否有充分興趣以細讀內容，此一問題在紐倫堡將無一人能與以解答。</p>

<p>〔合衆社紐約電〕蘇聯在今日，無論在政治或經濟方面，變成了一切世界性的爭議的發源地。然而在最近幾個月中，國際政治蒙蔽了世界經濟戰爭。世人都知道蘇聯的五年計劃，第一次五年計劃開始於一九三二年，第二次開始於一九三七年，第三次開始於一九四〇年，因戰爭而受阻。但是你得知道蘇聯現正着手於第四次更偉大的五年計劃。</p>
<p>這新計劃包含些什麼呢？</p>
<p>根據蘇聯官方所發表的報告，第四次五年計劃包含五大綱領：</p>
<p>（一）蘇聯工業生產量較戰前增加百分之五十；</p>
<p>（二）大量生產消費品；</p>
<p>（三）擴大科學的領域至蘇聯國境以外；</p>
<p>（四）供給資金以發展計值三千三百四十億盧布之新舊企業；</p>
<p>（五）蘇聯軍備之現代化。</p>
<p>在第一項增加工業生產項下，該計劃擬將蘇聯鋼鐵生產量較戰前增加百分之三十五。據蘇聯官方發表的文告稱：蘇聯鑒於國民經濟的恢復和發展，有賴於鋼鐵生產量的提高，因此蘇聯計劃將生鐵生產量增至一千九百五十萬噸，鋼生產量增至二千五百四十萬噸。該新計劃為擴展鋼鐵工業計，擬建築新式煽風式镕爐四十五座，新式露底式镕爐四十五座，新式露底式镕爐及化成爐一百八十座，新的　镕爐九十座，軋床一百零四架。</p>
<p>第四次五年計劃預定增加金屬產量如下：鋼產量較戰前增一·六倍，鋁增加二·六倍，鋅增加二·五倍，錫增加二·七倍，鎳增加一·九倍，　增加二·七倍，鋁增加二倍，　增加二·一倍。</p>
<p>此外新計劃擬將煤生產量提高到每年二萬五千萬噸，油產量增至三千五百四十萬噸，電力增至八百二十億瓩小時。</p>
<p>蘇聯官方預料至一九五一年時，蘇聯汽車生產量將達每年五十萬輛。此外，拖車·機器·電氣設備及機關　等生產量的增加，亦在新工業化計劃中。同時金融機　工具擬增至一百三十萬具。據蘇聯經濟學家指出，此數較一九四〇年美國所有之機械工具數目超過百分之三十。</p>
<p>在農業方面，該計劃不但擬恢復並發展農業生產量，並擬發展畜牧及土壤保養。據蘇聯政府發表之數字，假定一九三二年第一次五年計劃之農業生產總量為一百，則一九三七年第二次計劃為一百五十三，一九四〇年第三次計劃增至一百七十七。依據最近計劃，農業生產總量至一九五〇年時將增至二百二十五。據蘇聯某官員稱：「在五年終榖物收獲總量將增至一萬二千七百萬噸，即較一九四〇年增百分之七。」</p>
<p>此外，甜菜生產量將增至二千六百萬噸，棉花增至三百十萬噸，亞麻八十萬噸，向日葵子增至三百七十萬噸。以上數字平均較戰前生產量增加百分之十一至三十九。</p>
<p>蘇聯喊出了這一個新五年計劃，欲知它是否會如期完成，且待一九五一年便會分曉的。</p>

<p>〔民治社南京電〕記者於南京臨大學潮平靜後之下午，走訪敎育部杭次長立武，首先提出在勝利早已到臨之今日，敎育建設，實爲各種建設之基礎，敎部今後之私立學校立案，是否將仍如前採取萬分嚴格態度，抑或放寬尺度，獎勵私人辦學，以求國家敎育之提高與普及。杭次長答稱：關於各級私校之呈請立案手續，敎部仍按照以前法令辦理，暫時不致有所變更，惟敎部對私校當不斷予以鼓勵，敎部在一年以內，不贊成有人創辦新學校，因復員伊始，欲求原有學校之充實維持，已屬不易。記者又與杭氏討論基金問題，若學校基金按照規定，存在國家銀行，則根據近年來之經騐，該基金在若干時期後，受物價之影響，即化為烏有，學校將永無基金可言，未知敎部對此，曾予考慮否？杭氏答，正在攷慮中。</p>

<p>（二）鄒　象問　有甲女和乙男結婚已達三年有餘，（惟此婚姻是由雙方父母從小作主訂約的）婚後未及一月，甲即回家居住，據甲云因不滿乙之性情暴魯，並時常偸物變買賭博，勢難偕老，故甲走後即赴他處工作，以自謀生活，在此期內乙方未加過問，亦未至母家論理，今甲方要和乙方離異，並自願將嫁時所帶去之嫁具，不必追回，而乙方則不理不踩，亦未說離與不離，試問：（一）甲現在之身體是否有自由？（二）由甲方單獨登報聲明離婚是否有效？（三）自小由父母作主之婚的，是吾有效？（四）今我與用結婚，法律上是否有罪？（五）余婚後乙方是否可以干涉我等及控訴我和甲？</p>
<p>〔傅况鱗律師答〕　（一）按身體自由，固係法律所保障，惟甲未與乙離婚前，不能另與他人結婚。（二）無效。（三）旣已結婚，自屬有效。（四）不能在甲未與乙離婚之前結婚，吾則構成重婚罪。（五）乙均可依法吿訴。</p>

<p>〔傅况鱗律師答〕前欠債務，依現行法令，尙無應依物價指數若千倍歸還之規定，如彼此間無特別約定，可照原數額，以法幣歸還之。</p>

<p>— 茂芳</p>
<p>上海爲中外商賈雲集之地，各路客帮採辦商品莫不麕集於此，茲將呢羢客鋼之變遷事實，略述如次，各地首先向上海採辦呢絨者，爲華南華北二地，在滬開設申莊，如益順恒·益順盛·永豐利·世一堂等，關東帮附焉，粤南潮汕厦門帮，初多駐足虹口天潼路廣帮水菓行內，後漸自租甩衖房屋，其次爲川·黔·滇·湘·贛帮，如大川通·太古渝·怡和渝·招商渝·協記興·匯記興·益記棧·祥裕公（興昌隆·湖一公·長沙商棧等等，其他如北平·天津·靑島·烟台·漢口·開封·鄭州·濟南·西安·大連·江西等客帮，大半一年二次來申採配，春季兼辦夏貨，秋季兼辦冬貨，或附設於同業相熟友人之店號，或自租里衖房屋，如太平坊·渭水坊·聚元坊·景和里·陶朱里等處是。</p>
<p>民十四年後，華南帮需辦銳缺，因香港價廉，故均易地，就近購辦，同時大連帮都是轉口貨，因可收同關稅，故須原派司不可，後因商人作弊，政府取消退稅，該帮駐滬申莊乃紛紛收閉，而渝蓉與平津長江帮進胃大健，自政府奠都南京後，南京·蘇州·蚌埠·杭州·溫州·金華·寗波等小客帮，呢羢需辦突轉强旺，尤以南京帮爲最，同時關東興北帮之採辦驟減，因上海洋行多設天津分行，該帮均就近訂貨賣買，而大小川帮及江西帮採辦則轉盛，廿一年一二八後，客銷復又變遷，東北客帮大受打擊，紛紛收閉申莊而離申，幸內地客帮走銷有增無减，呢絨客銷統計得能依然有進無退，廿六年八一三全面抗戰後，水陸交通運輸漸由艱困而至停頓，各客帮被敵僞所壓迫，無不相繼歇業，客帮商棧收閉改組頗衆，在敵僞占居數年期內，除京滬杭三地有需銷外，絕無其他客帮採辦，但做單帮者及日商行運銷則驟盛，去年八月份抗戰勝利至今，各地客帮需銷復漸增殷，渝蓉帮首先旺辦，平津長沙南京帮次之，邇來先後均在復員中，逆料明春開始，水陸交通便利，呢羢客銷必能面目一新矣。</p>
<h3 id="c80">當前之衣的問題　原料人工急待調整　綻子織機呆擱尙多 <a href="#c80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕近日紗布市價高漲，紡建公司掛牌時，要求開貨者倍見擁擠，而該公司以供應軍需，開貨之批准，未免減少，因之民營布廠，供應更少，心思更高，實則外埠客銷，仍與平時不相上下，且即以紡建開貨而言，廿三日爲布六萬餘疋，廿四日爲紗八百餘件，廿五日爲布五萬五千疋，爲數亦尙可觀，則近日市價之漲，似係實銷以外，另有刺激，據染織業及棉布業潘士浩氏談稱，欲解決此問題，應先</p>
<p>促進生產機能　紡建現爲紗布業之權威，其生產機能，可的計如左：</p>
<p>可見紡建之生產機能，目下僅開動半數，且係單班制，則今後大有促進之餘地也，如能將其中之一部份，租讓與民營廠商，俾官民合作，以救濟衣的問題，更爲妥善，次則應</p>
<p>調節原料供應　花衣不足，仰給美棉，已甚痛心，而美國以今年棉產減色，將減少供應，允可啓發我人之省悟，在今日狀况之下，製品務求其平民化，俾僅有之原料，能盡量使用於日用必需之述，方合經濟原則，故細支之紗及高檔之布，不妨減少，本國花衣，方可多得參用之機會，美棉已定成而未到者，及其已到而未使用者，的在二百萬担左右，嘗與同業計算，按現在之開工率，民營國營，的可支持三個月左右，蓋民營約有紗綻二百餘萬，惟開工者不過半數耳，華北及鹽墾區等產棉之處，今以秩序及交通關係，未能與生產機能相銜接，甚爲可惜，民營廠商，應設法到產區搜購，則數十萬祖，亦可收集，當此距離新花登塲尙遠之時期中，花衣原料供應之調節，我人必須加以注意，再次爲應</p>
<p>調整勞資關係　使雙方措置能趨於紀律化，則於生產機能之促進，當可增加不少，目下民營廠商，紗廠號稱利潤優厚，近亦大不如前，布廠及染織廠環境更壞，除非勞資互諒，前途將不堪設想，且爲復蘇元氣起見</p>
<p>刧餘紗布發還　當不容再緩，紗布廠號對於此問題期待甚切，其由僞商統會移交我政府者，在二百萬疋左右，如能即予發還，直接可挽救被害廠號之運命，開接即可壓平紗布市面云</p>

<p>上週金融性各物波動劇烈，因游資尙未導入正軌，黃金證券鈔幣仍有畸形趨勢，惟中行對抑平黃金措施，頗收成效，黑市進退維谷，投機有雖思蠢動，終難得逞，至於商品方面，仍以米問題最嚴電，週初雖連小數日，後又回升，終成檳局，若無根本辦法，恐不易打破難關也·茲將各業一週動態分誌如次：</p>
<p>烚赤　上週趨勢以週一上落最大，在投機者買勢中，曾衝出二百萬大關，後因中行明配暗賣，銀根報緊，暗息高至二角外，人心虛軟，頻有出籠，行情頓吿傾退至一九一萬，週二續吿虛軟，後即站平，週三證券等套買，收價在一九六萬元，週四退人一九〇萬關內，週五六情勢轉變，蓋股市引人注意，投機者有套售活動，兩日間由一九〇萬左右回降至一八四萬，爲週末收市價·</p>
<p>外幣　本週即期美電匯匯率二〇二〇元，中央銀行供價未更，美鈔隨金市爲轉移，週初由二四二〇元，疾升至二五二〇元，爲本週之最高價，週二至週五始終徘徊於二四〇〇元左右，以週六之二二三五元爲最低，週未牧盤二三三五元，較上週末跌五五元。</p>
<p>公債　本週統丙公債暗市週在賣氣瀰漫下，由六六五〇退至六千關邊，週二續疲，週三週四買氣轉盛，週五局勢漸露曙光，人心向榮，週六收盤七八五〇元，爲本週最高價，較上週末漲起一二〇〇元</p>
<p>華股　週一初開尙穩，終因金價俏升，套賣頻繁，市勢節節下游，紗廠美亞各退入五四千關內，的跌四百元，三小型股則所跌尙微，週二以大戶拉抬，散戶吸意濃厚，市勢轉蘇，結果大型股提升較微，三小型股升一成强，週三初頗活躍紗廠美亞俱曾上升至五四千關外，嗣以浮多獲利吐售，轉成盤局，近午均見軋升，週四紗廠美亞及新光俱呈秀色，惟景福以投機者再施壓力，與勤興同吿落後，週五除新光微挫外，熱門股均吿軋升，尤以紗廠最爲俏俐，週六紗廠允俏，美亞亦被帶升，三小型股則好起極小。</p>
<p>外股　週一以華股挫落，賣風四起，各吿疲降，週二疲象稍舒，週三怡紗初開曾高至一二五〇〇元，旋晋入盤局，終與昨軋平，小型股則賡續趨俏，會德幾亦反動回升，週四以銀根寬鬆，多方益見活躍，怡紗曾喊高至一三五〇〇元，收盤全面向榮，週五怡紗曾升至一三七〇〇元，後浮多吐售而吿回，週六先漲後疲，結果都吿軋升·</p>
<p>米糧　週初食米，因當局檢查倉庫之說，再加當局限期登記存糧，市勢虛軟，週四食米零銷激增，本街進胃旺盛·價遂回升，麵粉亦吿向榮，週五市況平庸，週六食米喊價又高，交易寥寥，麵粉除現貨兵船挫二千元外，餘各俏數百元，雜糧呆定，食油略疲，食糖堅穩</p>
<p>現紗　在上週間，初因黃金與美鈔一致騰　，天津廣東內地等主要客帮現紗實際銷路暢旺，四十二支及三十二支雙股細紗，猶在紡建公司關住下，市上調劑籌碼乾涸，買氣飛黃騰達，星期二四十二支藍鳳紗曾創二百六十五萬空前新高峯，廿支雙馬亦到一百四十萬高價，嗣後以各紗續俱已張至登峯造極，廠家與多頭獲利豐盛，逢高傾向獲利轉賣，週二半日間竟達二十萬元之狂漲暴落，週三以後遂呈風平浪靜，全週以週三之四十二支藍鳳二百六十五萬為最高，週一之十支好做八十六萬爲最低，其過程高低相差一百七十九萬，若以支數言，則三十二支仙桃雙股漲勢尙盛十·比前週仍漲二十萬，其餘各級紗漲勢均和緩，皆不滿十萬元·</p>
<p>布市　週內雖以外貨充斥，惟以紗價較高，廠家成本提高，亦不願貶價遷就，况邇來軍服廠及童裝與洋傘之用途頗廣，週末最爲起色，各貨俱比前週昂二三千，大明灰光斜各漲六千元。</p>
<p>花市　週內廠家與花商需要尙稱不惡，紡建曾辦三千包，此外民營如申新一六七等廠及嘉豐蘇綸大生富安新生大成等廠亦有相當交易，週末高級米特林高至十萬五千，各比前週漲五六千元。</p>
<p>絲綢　上週用戶廠絲及干經週一與週六相較，各檔均短五萬元左右，蘇州與杭州客商均有採辦，高勻度洋行成交七十八分二百三十萬元及二百四十萬元，八十一分二百三十七萬五千元，八十三分二百六十萬元，人造絲一二〇號大橋最小週一價一百四十二萬元，最大週五價一百五十萬元，週六價一百四十七八萬元比週一大五萬元，七五號余鷄半光週一價一百五十四萬元，週六價一百五十萬元，計小四萬元，中紡公司開貨上週四較前週六大二萬元，是以一二〇號有光市價亦均提高，綢貨市價疲軟無力，格子璧縐當令貨，上週內尙短二百四五十元，美亞被面亦小二三萬元。</p>
<p>五金　本週五金大五金以定價低，實銷無，故市價疲軟不振，小五金亦然，惟綠紗以供求不相應，市價扶搖直上，達二十萬元，門鎖上者頗有客銷，如狗牌V門鎖，每打喊八萬元，而廠方猶難持成本云。</p>

<p>〔路透社倫敦二十六日電〕芝加哥論壇報記者稱，通常素稱可靠之人士透露，蘇聯以五十萬噸之小麥，供給法國，而所獲之代價，則達美金三三·〇〇〇·〇〇〇元之鉅，蘇法小麥交易內幕，嚴守秘密，蓋以蘇聯之以小麥運法，具有政治上拉攏之意，而法國目前正需美滙，以供復興、一且宣布其內容，將引起人民之反感，法總統古安及財長斐列浦，當然獲悉其中詳情，然因有所顧忌，亦均諱莫如深·</p>
<p>蘇聯對於美匯，企求甚股，其動機不外下列三端，（一）美元爲國際强權政治計劃中之利器，（二）蘇聯亦需要以美元購買美國之機械，從事國內之復興工作，（三）統制諸鄰邦之外匯，如波蘭及巴爾幹諸國，可使各該國易於就範，故美國進出口銀行貸與紅色圈內諸國之放款，蘇聯已能控制其用途。</p>
<p>聯總前指蘇聯拒絕合作救濟飢荒，究其目的，乃欲以其餘糧，作爲經濟利器，易取諸小國之英匯。美匯及瑞士金法郞等，蘇聯阻撓和平條約迅速成立，將使各小國之私人企業，瀕於破產，或淪人政府之手。</p>

<p>— 本報特約記者　邵愼之</p>
<p>兩度「自由」</p>
<p>一個說要出去，於是大家都願意走。大家都不肯放棄這個權利，但是理智的惠勒。他寗可待在家裏，他說：「我替你們看家，來應付意外。」我們同意他的機警，答應他半小時內即刻回來。</p>
<p>我們沿着朝陽路走去，向一度給蘇軍佔用爲司令部的協和會館，走向大同廣塲。常我們快到廣塲口的鐵絲網的時候，但看見廣塲附近由警察總署後面一所房子裏，成百成千的衣衫襤褸的老百姓，向外被人驅趕似的奔命。來勢兇湧，像江潮那般的奔出。我們要小心維護我們這片刻的「自由」，站住脚，不敢向人潮中逆進。</p>
<p>人潮的潮浪，愈滾愈大了，我們不能議潮浪白白底吞食下去，我們仍是退入我們自己的寓所。把門關得緊緊的，坐在屋子裏，靜心聽自己的呼吸聲。</p>
<p>一會兒王三爺上來了，王三爺就是吳子玉火帥的尊廚。他沒有開口，先把左手伸出來，兩個手指做了一個「八」字形，在我們面前不斷地搖擺，很低聲地說：「退了，外面新一軍打進來了。」說得非常得意，似乎是你們當記者的「包打聽」，消息還沒有我靈。我們沒有同他答話，他又鄭重底向我們取信，說：「我王三在長春的跑腿兒，也有兩手」（註：跑腿兒是北方人的偵探的意思。）</p>
<p>不一會兒，在白居仁科長來之前，我們的門上，又來了保護我們「安全」的「戰士」。這一次來了十六個，還加上一個政治指導員。</p>
<p>我們眞不明白，今天早晨在玩的什麽把戲，我們心裏想，這也許是調防。在三爺自己知道大牛砲放破了，中午上菜的時候，頭低得有超級的下垂，連目光都不正視我們。我們不禁好笑起來，在第二次上菜的時候，三爺躱在廚房裏不見了。</p>
<p>迄是我們第一次的「自山」，也是我們自己偷來的「自由」。</p>
<p>此後，我們就向周保中民主了。我們在廿一日把抗議書送出以後，時時在渴望着「准予自由」這四個字的大命令。可是悶在屋子裏的日子，反比在外面長。這沉長的愁居，委實難受。廿一日等到晚上，沒見回音來，廿二日又沒見回音來，廿三日整天是墜落在失望的獄中火煉！</p>
<p>廿四日，我們不再有行動自山的希望。呂公館裏的廚房送來了趙君邁給我們的便條，內書「今晨共軍來弟所搜査至嚴，衣服完全解除。此後恐不便來看你們，美記者五人，請兄等多多招待。他們是中國之友，而今日之長春仍究是中國的長春。弟邁上。」我們知道他也不自由了，當我們不再憧憬自由的希望時，忽然來了一個姓陳的朋友，似乎是做政工的。他帶來四個弟兄手裏都拿着長槍。</p>
<p>他說：「今天我奉周司令員的命令，陪同各位先生上街去玩玩。」此地還有周司令員的信。那信的內容是：「趙先生轉中美記者各先生：今日你們可以到市街遊玩，雖然天氣甚好，但無暇作陪，我要求你們聽從護衛人員關於警備的意見，原來蒙各位邀我今天到你處宴談，我要求時間問題由我通知而後定，專此敬禮。周保中四月廿四日」當時我們都出去了。惠勒因爲生病，躺在床上，我們第二次獲得自由行動，這是周保中給我們的。</p>
<p>我們仍是沿朝陽路，渦大同廣塲，經大同大街而入市塲。我們走在街上的時候，前面有兩個兵，後面又有兩個兵。大搖大擺自由自在的日本人，看見幾們美國人中間還雜着幾個中國人，讓共軍押在大街上走，心裏奇怪，或者想「這又是些什麼壞人？」「這倒底是怎麽一會事」？</p>
<p>貝克特第一個覺得有些臉紅，他偸偸底向世洵說：「這樣子眞像俘虜，糟透了！」</p>
<p>我們沿着露天市塲亂跑，一會兒美聯社的麥德生不見了。那位陳先生急得非凡，四處派人去找，我們被他攪個不淸，率性仍舊鑽入那假牢洞子到也安逸無事。我們一起走回寓所去。</p>
<p>一會兒，麥德生被找到了。他隨着一個士兵，在我們後面遠遠跑着。</p>
<p>常我們在休息室閒坐不久的時候，麥德生和那位陳先生，忽然吵架起來了。我們知道一定又閙出了什麽亂子。果然不錯，陳先生手裏拿着兩個照相機，一只是惠勒的「萊加」，一只是麥德生的「蔡司愛康」。</p>
<p>「我不過是照了協和會館後面的大火，並且是獲得那個士兵的同意。」麥德生一面申說，一面在擦頭上的汗珠。我們當時確是知道協和會館的大火，但內戰的火舌，我們在前兩天，已是司空見慣了。</p>
<p>「這兩個機子，一定要送給周司令員化騐，或許再還你，亦未可知。」陳先生的意思「査」騐，但他說了「化」騐，他說完這句話，帶了機子就走，也沒有寫一張收據，幾乎把麥德生氣瘋了。</p>
<p>下午：麥德生以他和惠勒二人的名義，草了一封給周保中的信，其譯文如下：「周保中將軍：</p>
<p>今天上午麥德生和其他幾個記者，由你派人保護之下，出去遊玩，麥德生自己帶了一架「蔡司愛康」，同時病在牀上的支加哥日報的惠勒，也把他的「菜加」交給麥德生，希望他替他照個相片。</p>
<p>麥德生僅僅照了協和會館大火的那張相片，那是早經得到衛士之同意，此外什麼都沒有照。陳先生今天早晨一定要把兩個照相機帶回去，他說要交給你看。他拿去的時候，也沒有給我們收據。</p>
<p>照相機是我們記者的工具，我們希望你還給我們，底片你要檢査我們是同意的，感謝你與我們的合作，此祝　健康！惠勒，麥德生上，四月二十四日。」</p>
<p>廿五日的上午，仍未見回音來，麥德生和惠勒都認爲沒收了。一會兒趙君邁偕同周保中的秘書長彭嘉仁來看我們，那時我們才知道趙君邁和賴秉權，張大同，曹隊長，吳士毅已在昨天搜身之後，遷移至火車站附近的大和通上的亞洲旅舍內。趙說：「伙食很好，比你們的還要强，相當優待我們。」我們總算放了心。</p>
<p>惠勒見彭嘉仁第一椿大事，是討還照相機。他說：「照相機和打字機，是我們職業祀者惟一的工具。其二缺一不可，希望你設法還我們。」</p>
<p>彭嘉仁允許設法，但沒有肯定發還。</p>
<p>同日下午，周保中又送來一函，內稱：</p>
<p>「趙世勛先生惠鑒（按：周給世洵的函件，均誤書以「勛」）並轉吿記者諸先生。出外採訪觀光，我個人是很贊成，我們的上級也原有指示，儘可能使諸先生獲有更多方便。近數日來長春市面秩序與治安，雖日有起色，但特務份子，暗中破壞行動，已數次發現，諸先生之行動安全，保中實負有責任，故不敢疏於警衛，務請諒解。今天若諸先生願意上街，我已令知警衛人員，伴同護送，惟請勿再照相，因長春現尙處於戒嚴時期。再者今晚擬趨謁諸先生請敎。請預定時間示知爲盼此祝健康弟周保中手啓四月廿五日」</p>
<p>惠勒和麥德生仍未聽見還他們照相機的消息。沒精打彩地朝床上倒下去，臉氣得發紫靑。</p>
<p>當天晚上請周保中吃飯時，他答應明天送來，說膠片元全未動。惠勒和麥德生自然高興，但是次日仍未送來，我們深感他們說話每每不易守信守時，或許目我們爲「俘虜」，不尊重我們。廿九日芮克少校武官準備回瀋陽的早晨周保中來我們寓所，接他去機塲，同他送行。常時又向周保中提起照相機的事情，他說待你們走之前再送回。</p>
<p>這是我們二度「自由」中的惟一不幸的事件。</p>
<p>秘密電臺</p>
<p>我們幽居在特派員公署以內的生活，也正好似合衆社記者貝克特於北平十日中央社電稱：是分三個階段，第一個階段，我們被視爲間諜，第二階段，我們被目爲政治犯，第三個階段，也就是五月一日，東北局由吉林遷長春，該局宣傳部長凱豐和我們談過話以來，（凱前任解放日報主筆）作風急轉，我們被禮優爲上賓。</p>
<p>這一節「秘密電台」的報導，也正是發生在我們被視爲間諜的第一個階段中我們被共軍政治指導員一次兩次不斷底問話，我們眞是窮於應付啊！</p>
<p>這是廿日的下午五時左右，幾個美國同業在園子裏打球，世洵剛剛午睡起床，方由房裏走出來，滿想加入他們的球戲，滿不想，就在這時候，忽然來了一個共軍，他第一句話是：「誰是趙世洵先生」問話的時候，正是看我們在十八日黃昏寫給旅政洽委員孫正的那張記者名單。</p>
<p>世洵毫不豫疑的說：「我就是。請問貴姓，有何見敎？」</p>
<p>「我姓陳名漢，來和你談談」陳說時，就向世洵臥室對面書房裏走。世洵於是隨了陳進入書房，愼之也跑了進來，應付問話。</p>
<p>陳漢年紀很輕，的摸廿七八歲，他說他從前在天津南開中學唸過書後來又在靑島山東大學唸土木工程系，所以他說他也懂英文。他吿訴我們，當他在山東大學的時候，唸過洪深敎授的英文。然而他又把話題轉到世洵身上，他說：「趙先生，你胖胖的很有些像洪深。」我問他：「是嗎？洪深是我的朋友，我自己並不覺得。」陳漢沒有做聲，兩個眼睛直瞅着天花板，咀裏亂吐紙烟圈兒，我們也種種坐在一旁，一動也不動，我們過着身處囹圄似的生活，他却來同我的輕鬆扯談，太不調和，十分不安。屋子裏靜極了，大家想不出什麽話來，我們也亂吐紙烟，這麽相持不下三分鐘的時光。</p>
<p>忽然他正色問我們：「你們這兒有電台沒有？」當時我們怔住了，不知他問的是什麽會事？</p>
<p>「什麽電台」慣之問他。</p>
<p>「你們發消息的電台。其實有也無所謂的，不過大家談談」陳漢又輕鬆下來。</p>
<p>「我們沒有電台，消息也沒有發，你不信可以立刻搜查」，世洵很坦白的向他表示。</p>
<p>道時陳漢狡猾起來了。他說他已經得了我們的電報稿子。他說我們曾經發過對於蘇聯不利和對於中共不利的新聞。他還說要是我們不信，他立刻可以給我們看電稿。</p>
<p>我們的血都沸騰起來了。我們憑事實報導，憑良心說話，我們從未做過欺騙讀者的事情。但這時無暇與他分辯這點，世洵毅然回答他：</p>
<p>「那末請你給我們看電稿吧：我們想來，並不如你那般的說法。」那時他話又軟下來，他說他原是問問而已，根本沒有什麽大關係。</p>
<p>他走出屋子，問問我們住在那兒，我們指指書房間對門的小房間。他也未經我們的同意，很傲慢底用力把門打開，觀察一番，我們眞不知什麽用意？</p>
<p>道時正是我們吃晚飯的時候，惠勒他們走進屋子來，問這位陳先生來有什麼事，這位陳先生不明白，要翻譯給他聽。他就說：「沒有什麽事，來看看你們的生活情形。」</p>
<p>惠勒說：「好的，那麽我可以吿訴你，我們的生活是俘虜的生活。」說完這話，就跑開了。</p>
<p>陳漢就大生其氣，警吿我們說：「這種態度，對這位先生以後是不利的，他呌什麽名字？」他摸出名單來看。面部的表情，兇惡得可怕。</p>
<p>我們吃飯了，請他便飯，他說吃過了，他仍坐下來同我們談話，他用筷子指着貝克特問：「這位是不是美國軍人？」貝克特就放下碗筷，用手扳過肩膀，給他看War</p>
<p>Correspondent的肩章。</p>
<p>第二次來偵詢秘密電台的是劉其人那兒的聯絡科長白居仁，他在廿一日上午來看我們的，常時他自稱是個小書記，我們也老老實實底相信他所說的，可是當天下午，世洵陪芮克少校武官，去見周保中交涉飛機和汽油的時候，周保中劈口便呼他「白科長」。我眞不知這位白先生的談謊，究竟有什麼作用？</p>
<p>他和我們談話的中心，也仍舊是離不了秘密電台，我們也仍舊像回答陳漢那般的答覆他。他又問美國人是不是有電台，我們也說沒有。我們也同樣的像要求陳漢一般的，要求白居仁去搜查，白居仁也說不必了。</p>
<p>他走出屋子的時候，在院子裏不斷注意縱橫交錯的電綫，似乎在分辨那一根綫是用在「秘密」電台上的。他對於我們的解釋，堅決不相信，並且說：「你們沒有電臺是不可能的。一</p>
<p>我們自己也有些奇怪起來了，大家硏究這秘密電臺的由來，眞有些秘密。</p>
<p>美國同業們，都喜歡在深夜用打字機寫稿子，五架打字機一同開動，這聲音自然會惹起「保護」我們的朋友的警覺性、這聲音遠遠偸聽，眞有些像無綫電的發報。</p>
<p>我們好笑起來，愈想愈笑，也愈覺得這問題複雜起來。</p>
<p>果然，在廿七日的下午，來了一位姓馬的營政治指導員，他說話比較深沉，也提起秘密電臺的事情，他開首就很直率的說，我們屋子裏，在夜裏有打電報的聲音。我們明白這一定是打字機惹出來的禍。世洵遂上樓把打字機取下來，親自表演給他看，他還不明白，他根木就沒有看見過打字機。說了半天，也就這麽半信半疑的去了。</p>
<p>走出屋子，在院子裏，也照例的巡視了一番電綫。</p>
<p>這一個空中渺茫的「秘密電臺」，先後被人査問過三次，這顯明是受上級命令的。</p>
<p>秀蘭鄧波兒新片「賣吻記」中的一個鏡頭。該片係勝利後鄧波兒第一張新片，即將在上海放映矣。</p>
<p>三個共軍</p>
<p>我們的生活實在枯燥極了，李普曼不知打什麼地方找到一支小提琴和一個小手風琴。沒有人能玩手風琴，李普曼玩小提琴却不錯，一吃過飯，大家在一處喝茶，他就手持小提琴問道：你們要什麽？</p>
<p>愼之則覓到一個留聲機，可惜壞了，用盡心思把他修理好，就天天開來聽，老是幾張片子，一直聽到大家倒胃口爲止。</p>
<p>因爲惠勒有些不舒服，請了一位醫生來，這事也事先向門口的保護者商談過准許了，就請來一位中國醫生，接着來了幾位瑞士人，他們佩有紅白十字的瑞士國旗，保護者以爲是像紅十字一樣，簡直就當他們是看護和醫生，讓他們進來。他們二男三女兄妹三人，前在馬戲團裏謀生，去年由阿根廷經過莫斯科來長春演藝，現在生活維艱，其中最小的一個女郞名英格葆，八一五後遭受輪姦，自述這故事時，臉色發靑咀唇顫抖。他們一看到美國旗，就來拜訪，他們一來，就要談天說地跳舞喝茶，攪上很冬時間，然後老實不客氣留下來吃飯，　飯本不算什麽，可是大司務買來的菜每天有定量，大司務就不易支配，買菜要跑到很遠的地方，臨時很難補充。他們每每在吃飯的時候到達，我們自然招呼他們一起坐下來。後來弄得我們不好處理，有一次只好輪班，關起門來吃飯，我們是一個團體，我們一方面歡迎，一方面不願意他們來，破壞我們的生活。</p>
<p>大司務常說：「東西貴啊，而且不容易買。」我們這才覺得這句話的份量。</p>
<p>門口的共軍在他們的第二次拜訪時就發覺不對，這些瑞士朋友在屋子裏一玩就是一天，廿七日來　他們出去了。說那有看病看一天的。我們吿訴他說：他們是瑞士人，並不是醫生，這就使他愕然，但是說：「瑞士人更不行，我們負不了責。」</p>
<p>「是不是不准我們見客呢？」</p>
<p>「我們奉命令是什麼人都不准進屋來的。」</p>
<p>他們走了。可是第二天又來，帶着一個留聲機，於是又惹麻煩，同保護者交涉，旣是不准進屋子，那麽他們旣然來了，旣讓在國子裏躭一回。由李普曼草了一封信，以中美記者團署名，送給劉其人，通知他這裏所發生的事情，問他是不是爲了我們「安全」，不能出去，連我們見客也一起不准嗎？要求他讓我們能够作正常的社交。請他答覆。信交給保護者，但仍舊原信拿回，說沒有找到。</p>
<p>這時瑞士人所帶來的留聲機就在國子裏開起來，並且在洋台上跳舞，旣然站定了脚就採取得寸進尺的辦法，仍由照呼他們進屋子去，保護者仍來嘰咕，表示負不了責，但似乎可以通融辦理。於是答應他們可以讓他們早些回去，不使這些戰士爲難。</p>
<p>這些瑞士人還是繼續來，每來則必使我們在門口與槍桿兒辦交涉一次。這次拖來了一小車道具，我們說明是來變把戲的，等一會請八路軍也來看。這次表演了兩個節目，一是雙人舞，二是技術表演。彷彿中國馬戲團裏的脚上工夫，兩位女郞兩足朝天，各輾動紙板製的圓桶一個，然後又換兩把中國雨傘，技術很平常，可是博得讚美。因爲我們實在沒有什麽東西看。</p>
<p>卅日下雨有兩個共軍把我們的留聲機「借」去了答應晚上送回來。但晚上並沒有送回。（後來由周保中的秘書去査後，才在五日送回）。中午瑞士朋友又來，這回一起來全家八位，兄妹五人外，還有他們的雙親大人和一個小孩子。可是我們今天的食物不够了。我們只做了一缸湯給他們吃。</p>
<p>我們正在會客室坐定談天的時候，忽然有三個共軍冒雨而來，直入我們的屋子，要借瑞士朋友的留聲機。愼之吿訴他們：剛才已經有人來借去了。</p>
<p>「那是別人，我們不知道，你們是什麽人」？</p>
<p>我們吿訴他們是記者。</p>
<p>「那不行，我們爲人民服務，你們不借也要借」。接着看我們有拒絕的意思，就戟指瞪眼破口大駡，下流極了，態度蠻橫，從未見過。這幾個人都不是在門口守衛的，比較起來，守衛的人是實在太客氣了。</p>
<p>接着就動手槍，另外兩個到後面去搬木板。這時貝克特就把留聲機放在會客室裏，把門拉上，這胖子就站在門口，檔住去路說道：</p>
<p>「這留聲機是我們客人的，我們不能借，我們自己的可以借，而且，你們已經借去了」。</p>
<h3 id="c91">江都之旅 <a href="#c91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>— 石亦鳴</p>
<p>蘇北情勢，外弛內張，頃聞揚州已為　雲所　軍，非經許可，船隻不許靠岸，人民不准進城。大江北岸，此碩果僅存之名城，躺有變化，則蘇北將另成一局面，千　流亡在外人士一豈僅忽然憂之而已載？</p>
<p>記者於上月下旬，曾有揚城之旅，往返計五日，雖屬走馬看花，然鱗光片羽，所聞所見，根觸殊深，茲當國人射綫集中此漕運古道一角危邑之際，願書供關心者之參考云爾。</p>
<p>揚州於廿六年冬淪於敵手，八年以來，受難最深而被虐最慘者厥在鄕區，西北鄕爲其尤，即勝利迄今亦然。據記者探悉其經過如下二</p>
<p>揚州淪陷後，當時國軍一部，退守西北鄕黃珏橋公道橋一帶，軍精糧餉，皆取於鄕民。城區居民，因恐遭敵寇屠戮，皆扶老携幼避居鄕區。敵寇洩慾無由，乃有漢奸吳筱侯方小亭等獻媚謂「江都美女盡在鄉間」，於是由吳方二逆導引敵天谷寇兵不時下鄕姦淫擄掠，致更激發鄕民抗戰情緒，紛紛揭竿而起，自動組成「江都縣抗日支隊」「民衆剿寇團」「鋤奸團」「特工組」「游擊隊」等團體。其中有計劃之行動爲派人入城行刺吳逆筱侯與龍尾田截擊寇兵二事。不幸吳逆被刺未死，惱怒之餘，復慫恿敵天谷率寇大舉淸鄕，致殘殺無算。</p>
<p>廿七年春，陳文集合游兵散勇數千人，又組織一抗日支隊；同時會合其他各級抗戰部隊，議舉攻城，但事機不密，爲敵偵悉，於是鄕區乃遭受所　　二度之「大淸鄕。」</p>
<p>其時人民捐稅重重，有所謂田畝　，抗日視，飛機捐，紳富捐，種種苛雜，不一而足；更有一般土匪軍隊，假抗日名義，强豪索奪抬人勒　，濫施毒刑。不幸是年秋北湖水患，近湖田禾　成　　，山田爲風暴摧毁，收成全無。</p>
<p>廿八年春，各級抗戰部隊以及陳文支隊，均爲敵寇擊破，惟地方民衆抗日大隊碩果僅存，後有陸慶源者出爲合併，組成江都縣常備隊與敵週旋。是年秋湖水未退，山田赤地千里，惟各種捐稅，仍逼令晨民繼續負祖。</p>
<p>廿九年，有通州籍張德雲者，假抗日名義，在許巷·淮泗，槐子等鄉，苛捐勒索，爲江都縣常備隊驅逐出境，是年秋湖水退遲，近湖一帶農田，僅得半收，山田乾旱，顆粒全無。</p>
<p>卅年，常備隊爲謝侉子攻散，江都縣縣長張濟傳率領屬員流亡西北鄉。地方父老傾囊慨助，靑年踴躍參加，在僞縣府僞軍及敵憲兵隊嚴密搜索下，張縣長及其工作人員得以安全繼續工作者，北鄕人士之庇護，與有力焉。尤以翌年春，新四軍亦滲入活動，地方人士之肆應，更見艱苦。</p>
<p>卅二年，僞輩王老虎亦率大隊盤踞司徒廟，槐子橋，公道橋，黃珏橋一帶，按地方富戶，逐一綁架勒牘，並以新四軍頭銜加諸殷實，如有不遂其欲機款，即行砍殺，懸頭示衆。因之新四軍乘機施惠於民，王老虎雖一度對戰新四軍，徒毁地方元氣，終於敗走，此時，新四軍乃實行以下三個政策：一，破壞廟宇凡西北鄕廟宇寺院，不論年代久遠，一律燒燬，俾絕以後任何軍隊佔用；</p>
<p>二，打倒資本凡地方巨戶財產，一律化整爲零，普遍分配貧民；惟在化整爲零中，須經所謂「農抗會」重重捐派；</p>
<p>三，實施淸黨凡國民黨員或參加抗戰靑年，擁護政府士紳，非殺即拘。</p>
<p>於此種情况，鄕區農民紛紛逃亡來城，其家破人亡流離載道之痛苦，誠無可言宣。一面旣須支持抗戰，供應從事地下活動之縣府需求；一面則又有家難歸，有田不能種；一面處敵僞淫威之下如此三重生活，堅　以至抗　　利。</p>

<p>三分軍事，七分政治，最高當局此一賢明之口號，不僅爲抗戰期中之上臬，勝利後更有其重要性。江都兵燹之後，又遭共黨雕虐地方，地方當局此時各種措施，允宜特別愼重，求其合理，求其公平，吾則，人民怨憤之餘，頗易挺而走險。茲以此次江都縣所圈定之參議員爲例，誠有令人不能已於言者。</p>
<p>此次江都縣所圈定之參議員中，如高貽孫，曾充僞第三師參議；如田悅邱，前係日本醫院醫士，過去勾結敵僞，魚肉人民；高豫則係前僞南京靑年團宣傳員（化名高三立）；議長朱幹臣曾於僞組織時期，在便益門外開設復成糧行，利用經理詹鶴皋，充當米業公會主席，操縱全縣食糧資敵，壓迫同業攤捐，主辦聯營社以媚敵；副議長郁培仁於敵僞時期（廿八九年）在鎭江三區上　鎭，化名丁建，充任屠宰稅及營業稅主任，並兼辦新鎭日報，宣傳毒化，爲敵僞張目。凡上所述，江都人士莫不知之甚稔，圈之爲人民代表，人民如何能堪？</p>

<h3 id="c92">英美專家在德國　試騐原子彈威力　絕對保守秘密嚴禁參觀 <a href="#c92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>— 本報編譯特譯</p>
<p>假定原子戰爭在不久的將來——譬如說，明年或後年——即行發生的話，那麼，你儘可以安然躱在地底下，或竟躱在像德國人在不萊梅所造的潛艇庫那樣防炸性三和土建築物裏面，而絲毫沒有一點危險。</p>
<p>假定原子戰爭發生得較遲些。那麼，無論你躲在空中，地面或地下，總不能够避免危險。換句話說，假定英美專家在德國勞動靑年團所築的鋼骨三和土大建築物上面試騐轟炸力所得到的秘密，給其他國家發覺了，那麽，原子戰爭的危險性，就難能避免。誰都該知道，目前的原子炸彈不能完全應付攻擊戰，像廣島被炸後的結果所引起的想像那樣。譬如，據主特不萊梅試騐的專家說，無論何種炸彈都不能爆破德國的潛艇庫，這是目前世界上最牢不可破的建築物。它不能够損壞慕尼黑附近墨斯爾道夫的地下工廠，至於更深的坑道或地道，當然更加安全了。</p>
<p>假定德國勞動靑年團知道得早些，及時築好像墨斯爾道夫等處所築的防禦工程，那麽，德國的工業就不致於受到空襲的損害或許說不定戰事至今還在延續下去</p>
<p>消滅抗彈最後障碍</p>
<p>深入轟炸目標</p>
<p>在目前沒有方法可使原子炸彈在爆炸以前穿入金屬或三和土裏面，或鑽入地下在地下室或地道中引起人爲的地震。如果發生戰爭，敵人一定躱在鉅大的金屬或岩石防禦物下面以避危險，因此，英美專家現正硏究怎樣可以打擊到敵人的方法</p>
<p>的確，他們必須消滅那抵抗炸彈的最後障碍，他們正在不萊梅進行這一件工作，有英國皇家空眾的衛隊看守着全部區城，不准外人參觀，絕對保守秘密。最火的英美轟炸機，正用各種炸彈——有十一噸重的英國式大炸彈，四千五百磅重的美國「狄斯耐」火箭炸彈向向着四分之一哩長一百碼閱的建築投擲。這些「狄斯耐」炸彈是比較新式的，外觀像魚雷，裝有火箭機關以代替推進器。當炸彈近地面時，火箭放射，而藉加速力使那炸彈深入轟炸目標。</p>
<p>運用「深入性炸彈」　地坑失卻安全</p>
<p>英美專家的此項硏究工作，到今年八月間將滿一年，此項工作或許已經完成，他們或許已有方法使任何地面的建築物在戰時完全失去防禦的功能，以及使炸彈深入地下。例如此次戰爭中對於倫敦大有帮助的地道，將來會變成「深入性炸彈」的目標。同時，他們知道了把原子炸彈裝入「深入性炸彈」的方法時，即使最深度地的坑也不能安全了（合衆社倫敦廿三日電）</p>

<p>主筆先生：物價高漲，薪給有多感入不敷出之苦，國中公敎人員，勤勞所入，猶不能與販夫走卒比。於是調整待遇之要求，風起雲湧，庠序輟其弦歌，公堂延期對簿，舉國滔滔，衆腹俱枵。立法院諸公乃有調整待遇之議案，送請行政院施行。値此議而未決之際，謹將公敎人員現在待遇情形，提供討論，或亦世人所願聞歟！</p>
<p>抗戰八歲，勝利近年，生活困苦，由來已久，而淸廉之公僕，枵腹致死者究竟不多，實則公敎人員所恃以支持者，除應得本薪外，往往尙有其他收入：（一）兼職。我國人事，素來做事多者報酬少，做事少者報酬多。中上級人員往往有暇兼職，多領幾份餉銀，只是一人精力有限，無論如何能幹，數處奔走，精神不能貫注。譬如一人身兼三職，仍要三人成功一事，國家化同樣許多錢，仍做同樣許多事，錢未省用，事未多做，對木人對國家俱無經濟可　。而且下級職員事繁，不能兼職，允屬不公之至。（二）掛名。高級職員薪入不敷，常以乃妻乃子在木機關中掛名補差，形同冗員，坐領乾薪，在官塲中常見（三）升薪。薪津不敷應用，便將個人薪級增高，工友升爲練習生，練習生升職員，上下交征，於是大學校役與校長之薪給相差無幾，經濟部長與國營廠工無多軒輊。我等固不願復見階級制度之餘毒，固亦雅不欲負國家重任之廉吏，常分心於飢寒也。（四）特別津貼。有收益之數機關。於無辦法中，便巧立名目，特別津貼職員，或曰車馬費，或曰飯資，或云墊借，或云先發餉數月，不一而足。（五）空額。浮報員工數目，吃空額朋分，在隊伍中最多聞見，最近某地警局事件，記憶猶新。干犯國法之事太多，此處不敢想像，亦不欲多言。</p>
<p>從上所見，目下公敎人員待遇，非惟數目低得不合理，其方法亦不經濟，不公平。筆者厠身公敎人員之一，見聞所及，相信靑天白日旗幟之下，大多數公敎人員或軍警皆能潔身自好，黽勉從公。此後爲不使人心渙散，錯人岐途計，除對待遇的「數目」，自有當局諸公，統盤籌劃，此時不便代謀外，對調整待遇的「方法」，極想提出幾點，促請當局注意。此對國家預算，行政效率，民氣士氣，甚至主義信仰，或皆有重大關係：（一）兼職絕對不能兼薪；（二）取締冗員駢枝機構；（三）命令各機關重行公平審訂職工新額；（四）特別津貼，變相加薪，一槪取消；（五）嚴懲假公濟私之流。抗戰已勝，凡屬國民，雖不能侈會享受，凡爲政府，豈忍人枵腹從公！上述方法云云，若能確切做到，有此挹注，則雖將待遇數目合理調整，對於國庫支出，恐亦未必惡性增加，旣合經濟原理，又不患分配不均。質之賢者，以爲何如？公敎一員謹啓。五，廿三。</p>

<h3 id="c96">祝全國工業協會滬分會成立 <a href="#c96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>— 益</p>
<p>最近中國全國工業協會上海市分會經幾個月的籌備，宣告成立，在宣言中曾舉下列六項為今後工作的目標，計：</p>
<p>（一）促成工業會法之制定。</p>
<p>（二）完成　國父實業計劃之建設。</p>
<p>（三）貫澈全國工業化之目的。</p>
<p>（四）加緊工業經濟之研究。</p>
<p>（五）安妥戰後工業之設施。</p>
<p>（六）注意修改商約之貢獻。</p>
<p>在進行的時候，分為組織工作，報道工作，學術研究工作和調查工作四點。</p>
<p>的確，在抗戰期間，有許多工廠，曾隨國軍西移，對於抗戰，建下了不可磨滅的功動，而在勝利以後，一般工廠，都遇到意料所不及的困苦，對於中國工業的前途，一般人都有岌岌可危的恐慌。今後如果中國的經濟要謀復興，那末先決問題是要使中國工業復興，解決目前的困難，計劃未來的發展。</p>
<p>要達到這個目的，單獨的力量，決不能勝任，一定要應用大衆的力量。所以事實上最重要的是組織方面的工作，正如該會所發表今後工作的展望中所說：「一個團體的力量大小，完全要看團體組織的健全與否。」和「會員各業團結，一致對外，消除已往同業間的嫉視，挑撥，誤會或離間等破壞性的分化工作，應該互相帮助，互相融洽，以同生共死的精神，共同團結。」</p>
<p>現在上海市分會業已宣告成立，理監事也已選出就任，希望今後該會能夠按照已定方針，切實做去，挽救垂危的中國工業，而奠定今後發展的基礎。</p>
<h3 id="c97">立興長城牌熱水瓶廠參觀記　並訪問復員情况 <a href="#c97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>— 巴玲</p>
<p>熱水瓶，為日常生活用品之一，近年以來，無論窮鄉僻壤，大家小戶，都得置備一二只熱水瓶，以為洗飲之用。記者為欲明蹽熱水瓶之製造過程，及該業之近况起見，特赴以「晶質料瓶膽」馳名於社會之立與「長城牌」熱水瓶廠參觀，茲為關心工商業者所樂聞！</p>
<p>由於該廠經理甘斗南氏的招待，記者得巡視全廠一週，甘氏說：立興廠創辦於民國十八年，那時他鑒於熱水瓶一物，不但為家庭日用品之一，且為行旅的恩物，然歷年向由外洋輸入，利　外溢，實堪痛心，同時，因為日貨熱水瓶，充斥市塲，甘氏為提倡國貨，與日貨奮鬥計，乃決心集資創設「立興」熱水瓶廠於閘北其美路，並以「長城牌」為商標，以其含有「鞏固國防」的意思義，立興廠成立後，即開始製造各式熱水瓶，以應市銷，因出品精良，營業臻臻日上，嗣設發行所於吉祥街德銘里，以為業務往來的樞紙。自「長城牌」熱水瓶廠問世後，因質料上乘，久用不壞，國人咸樂於購置，挽回了不少的利權，這種功蹟，實在是不可磨滅的。</p>
<p>不幸「八一三」抗日戰爭發生，敵寇侵入上海，該廠廠址，適當其衝，甘氏十餘年心血的結晶，完全犧牲在敵寇砲火之中，其損失之重大，眞是難以估計。但甘氏並不消極，反因此而更積極起來。在民國二十七年春間，立興廠在甘氏主持之下，於戈登路荔浦路口，建造廠屋百餘間，雇用職工三百餘人，恢復工作，積極生產，且整理內部，嚴密管理，開工人宿舍；特約醫院，以保護工人健康；設訓練班，以養成按術人才；工作餘暇，更施以相當敎育，使工友增進知識，安心樂業，而收勞資合作之效。更根據歷年經騐，發明「晶質料瓶膽」開熱水瓶界之新記錄，這種精神，記者認為是值得效法的。</p>
<p>至於熱水瓶的製造手續，記者經參觀並蒙甘氏指示後，知道共有三種下列步驟：</p>
<p>（甲）瓶膽之部——先溶化玻璃，製成內外瓶坯兩種，將外瓶割底，內瓶割頸，兩瓶割頸，兩瓶結合，拉成外瓶之底，將瓶頸割齊，再收合瓶口，使成為一瓶膽，然後鍍銀，抽氣，瓶膽於是全部完成。</p>
<p>（乙）製売之部——以銅皮用剪刀車　成合於標準尺寸之片子，用冲床冲成瓶蓋和瓶　，又將瓶蓋瓶肩鍍　，再將白鐵皮裁成合式片子，以滾　車等製成売子，加上噴漆後，瓶売之製造手續，全部完成。</p>
<p>瓶膽瓶売製成後，以瓶膽配合於瓶売之中，便成為完整之熱水瓶，若瓶膽配合於鐵売中，便是鐵売熱水瓶；反之，若以瓶膽配合於竹売中，便是目前市上流行之竹売熱水瓶矣。</p>
<p>參觀完畢後，和甘氏談及該業目前復員情形。甘氏認為勝利後的熱水瓶，所以未能全部復員者，厥為下列數項困難問題之未獲解決。</p>
<p>（一）原料的飛漲：熱水瓶所用之原料，如鐵皮之價格，較戰前計漲五六千倍，煤斤計漲一萬五千倍，其他各項原料，無不較戰前漲起數千倍以上，以如此昂貴的成本，來從事生產，是否能適合一般人的購買力，殊成問題。故大部份工廠，均暫抱觀望態度，不敢貿然全部復工。</p>
<p>（二）運用資金的缺乏：熱水瓶同業，在抗戰期中所受之損失，至為慘重，今復工生產，非有相當資金，實不能運用周轉，故甚盼金融界，尤其是國家銀行，予工業界以鉅額的低利貸金，扶助其復工。</p>
<p>（三）運輸的困難：目前戰事雖告結束，然各地交能，尙未完全恢復，熱水瓶的銷路，各大商埠中，以南洋等處為大宗，交通旣未全部恢復，該業自不敢全部復工，俾免受資金凍結的影響。</p>
<p>（四）工潮的澎湃：本市因生活日高，致各業工潮，此平彼起，使工業界感受無上的苦悶，熱水瓶同業，因鑒於工潮的嚴重，不敢招致大量工人，致因工潮問題，而引起種種糾紛云。</p>
<h3 id="c98">勞資合作增加增產 <a href="#c98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>— 蒙姜</p>
<p>最近勞資雙方的糾紛，已使調解者束手無策。這短短數月勞資糾紛的病態，已非加薪而漲價，漲價而加薪而造成資方開支無力，漲價無能。今後若非謀根本上之解決，則此劫後僅餘的工商業，一面因成本增加而銷售困難，另一面又將受外來低價貨物之傾銷，恐將由此而一病莫救。</p>
<p>物價騰貴的結果，使購買力絕度降低，製造商的銷售亦因此而呆滯；因此今日生產額降低，此種間接因購買力低落的關係，亦原因之一。同時，另一方面，却正因生產額降低，而造成物產缺少，此所以今日雖購買力極低，而物價却又不普遍一般的下降。由過去短短數月的觀察，可知今日的情况，已非漲價增薪的循環圈，而是生產額與購買力的循環圈了。欲針對當前急務而謀解決，惟有</p>
<p>一·增加生產。</p>
<p>二·增加生產又需建立在勞資誠意密切的合作上。</p>
<p>吾人當可深信，生產額增加後，必為物價低落，物價一旦下降，購買力即可漸漸增高，旦購買力逐步增高後，工商業銷售額亦必隨之而活躍，銷售額增加後，勢必僱用更多工人而使失業減少，其結果必為物價再度下降，而使購買力再度增加的結果。吾人若放大目光，于大處着想，十年廿年後，中國亦可與今日的美國一樣，使全國人民成為更優良的消費者，而且能够消費更優良的貨品。</p>
<p>因而，今日的勞工須切忌以為增加薪工，可以解決生活，而忘却本身的生產力，此種根觀念，一日不改，則無異自殺。美國工人之所以能在世界市塲中佔優勢，實因生產能力遠超其他工人。而可憐者，國人之生產力遠低于美人，今日反超出美國工人所能獲得之薪金；試問在極度專業化國家所製造之貨品，國人將何以抵抗。為互助的原則下，資方切不可僅謀個人的財利，而使却氏囊飽滿的勞工，則其本身忘之工商業永無安寗之一日。</p>
<p>當局生活調整指數，各方已多有論及，調整指數旣有不妥，合作相助的原則，又將如何建立？筆者以為今後勞工薪金，于最低規定額外，以勞工之生產力為根據。工人生產能力僡高，獎勵之酬報亦高。工人受此獎勵必努辦于工作，且因更高之酬報而技術精益有精。資方却因工人普通生產力增加，成本必可減輕，成本減輕，銷售可稍鬆動，此豈非雙方受利，而無形中增加生產促成物價下降。此外吾人當然不能否認，如物資合理的配給用與運，交通問題，政治問題，皆息息相關而急待解閃。總之。為復興建國計，人人當犧牲一巴之利益，為羣衆謀福利。使整個國家社會得振興才是。</p>
<h3 id="c99">菸葉業槪况 <a href="#c99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>— 君宜</p>
<p>在太平洋戰爭爆發之後，由於外洋菸業的無法輸入，我國菸葉一度得到抬頭的機會。戰前每年輸入之數，消耗曾達五億餘元，及敵寇攫得英美烟公司後，未及一載，所在原料即告用磬，乃不得不採用我國菸葉，特設中支菸草株式會社分佈產地，並將菸葉列入統制品內，非有該社派司，外人無法採運。彼所設立之捲菸廠，由於技術人員焙製得法，出品並不遜於過去，則可知祇須人工上加以改良，國產菸葉未始不能與舶來品並駕齊驅也。勝利之後，美國捲菸又已充斥市上，長此以往，國內各捲菸廠勢必大受打擊，所幸本文作稿時，報載美國已接受我政府建議禁止菸葉輸入，確是捲菸商的一個喜訊。不過出產菸葉者不僅美國一國，如土耳其印度等，戰前均有輸入我國市塲，何况美國憶製成之捲菸不在禁列，前途危險仍多，尙有待於經營斯業者之悉心研究，加以改善也。</p>
<p>我國菸葉以安徽甘肅兩省為產量最富，惟後者多供土烟之用，皖省則南北兩部均有，皖南所產者總名土菸葉，以隣近安慶之桐城為中心，即以該地而論，每年輸出已有三萬餘担。其他如大通，巢縣，無為，和縣，盧州，渚頭山等，均有出產，惟品質略遜，皖北所產則　菸葉為多，有鳳陽阴光蚌臨淮關等處，數量約相等於皖南之土菸葉，兩者非內行不易辨別，僅色澤較　菸葉稍黃耳。其他尙有菸絲，菸筋等種，為華之尖部及其莖，質地亦較堅硬。</p>
<p>目前菸葉業之難於發展，考其原因一則捐稅太重，自產區以至吸戶，名目之多近十種。另一則交通工具缺乏運輸困難，即以桐城至上海而言，須經大通土橋蕪湖南京等數次舟車之更調週折，其間又多屬水道，用舊式木駁拖運，所費時間人力至鉅，且每逢雨雪，菸葉一經着潮，即成廢物，損失更鉅。目前運費竟超過產區菸價兩倍有奇，毋怪外國菸葉雖　涉重洋，仍能在我國市塲爭一日之短長也。至於菸葉之種植，近百年來至今仍墨守陳法，亦堪杞憂，均應注意及之。</p>
<h3 id="c100">工商管理槪論 <a href="#c100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>— 徐百益</p>
<p>心理在工商業中的重要性</p>
<p>我們在前面已經把管理工作的幾種最重要的原則，加以討論，現在可以談一談心理方面的重要。</p>
<p>我們應該仔細想一想，造成一個主管人員的最大原因是什麼？有人說，那是由於體力的勝人，譬如說，某一個人具有强健的身體，因此他可以負起主管人員的一切重任，但是事實上身體的强健固然重要，還是是最重要的一點，例如拿破崙·卡尼奇·他們都曾有過人的能力，然而他們並不是强健的人。有人說，那是由於先天性的良好遺傳，但是許多成功的主管人員或是成功的事業家，他們的上代，都並不是具有地位的人。有人說，那是由於開始的時候，就有一種便利，這一點在事實上也不盡然，譬如說，美國鋼鐵大王却爾斯·司惠勃是一家鋼鐵廠裏的工人出身，世界最大富翁之一洛克菲勒是在一家很小的經理商那裏做簿記員的，有許多目前據有着崇高地位的事業家都是從極低微的地位爬起來的。</p>
<p>那末一個主管人員的主要成功條件，終究是什麼呢，就是具備一種管理的能力。這一種能力，大部份是屬於心智Mental方面的，因此要成為一個成功的管理人員，第一先要造成一種健全的心智。</p>
<p>我們可以舉一個例來說明一個主管人員，怎樣可以利用他的心智而使他的事業順利進行，或者達到成功的目的。從前美國有一家規模很大的雜誌出版公司，他們對外，是以服務周到寄遞迅速著名的，但有一次某一段的鐵路，行將暫時停止，於是那一家雜誌公司的發行主任，就立刻設法找出了另一條路綫來，使時間方面，絲毫沒有損失，所以一個主管人員，必須隨時利用他的心智，以適應環境而解決各種困難的問題。</p>
<p>在世界潮流不斷演進，事務的處理，日就複雜的今日，尤其需要養成健全的心智，以謀應付，以謀發展。</p>
<p>今後當就事業的方面，加以討論，而以心智為討論的中心。</p>
<p>二種心智</p>
<p>在商業方面，需要二種不同的心智，一種是聽命於人的，其他一種是授命給人的，一個管理人員，往往是屬於後者。</p>
<p>那末要達於授命給人的地步，應該怎樣呢。那就要具備下列幾個條件：</p>
<p>一·創造的精神　無論那一種事業，如果沒有進步，就要退步，因此一個主管人員，必須具備創造的精神，尤其在遇到新問題發生的時候，要用最大的努力，去謀解決，否則一味墨守成法事業不會進步，問題不得解決。</p>
<p>創造的精神的產生是基於一種自動的習性的，所以先要養成自動的習性，對於任何事情，都首下研究的功夫。那末在應付各種問題的時候就可以迎刃而解。</p>
<p>因為具有自動的習性，由於日常各種問題的處理，就可以有很多可貴的經騐，這種經騐，就可以成為一種「知其所以然」的根據。現在美國的工業界對於所謂「知其所以然」Know　How一點，非常重視，因為凡事能够「知其所以然」就可以免除各種錯誤的見解和錯誤的決定。</p>
<p>二·負責任這一點可以說是和自動的習性和創造的精神相連的，要成為一個成功的主管人員，負責任是非常重要的，基於肯負責任一點，就可以使他對於問題，仔佃研究非求到合理解決不可，一個能够管理別人的主管人員，必須能够負起責任，而担負一切的後果。</p>

<h3 id="e1">The Great Traitor Wang Yintai and 14 Others Were Escorted from Beiping to Beijing Yesterday for Trial, with Crowds Lining the Streets Cursing Non-Stop <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch on the 26th] The great traitor Wang Yintai and 14 others were escorted to Beijing this morning. When the group of traitors had their blood pressure checked at 5 AM this morning, they realized they were being escorted to Beijing for trial. They hurriedly wrote "last letters" to their families, mostly advising them not to worry, but with a sense of reluctance to leave. Wang Shijing and Yu Jinhe, who were detained at Wang's residence, were temporarily taken to the Army Prison to assemble for departure. Wang Yintai was designated "Yu Character Number One," handcuffed together with Jiang Kanghu, and divided into seven pairs as they walked out of the prison. Wang Yintai wore a gray Western suit, while the others wore long robes. Yin Rugeng was wearing a vest, looking somewhat like a clown. Zhou Zuoren's bald head and clothes were the most worn. The best dressed was Wang Shijing, in silk robes and Western leather shoes. Compared to Zhou, onlookers sighed and said, "Even as a traitor, he still gets to head the finance department." The expressions of the traitors varied as they emerged from prison. Wang Yintai seemed quite shy, keeping his head down as much as possible, pulling his felt hat down, making it difficult for photographers. The others were relatively calm, with Wang Shijing in the best spirits. Before getting into the car, reporters asked each one for their thoughts. Wang Yintai said, "The whole of North China knows about my affairs, I have no thoughts." Zhou Zuoren said, "I have been waiting to be arrested all along, I have no thoughts." Zhou has lost weight and his attitude remains "indifferent." Yu Jinhe said, "Punishment is right, but I hope our actions will be investigated in detail." Qi Xieyuan said arrogantly, "I have never done anything wrong, Chairman Chiang also said I am strict and old." The escorting soldiers were very polite to him, and Qi lectured the escorting soldiers in the tone of an instructor, recounting his "glorious history" when he was with Marshal Wu. He also said how they should conduct themselves. Tang Yangdu said, "I have saved more than forty underground workers." The group of traitors traveled by military truck to the airport, with crowds lining the streets, spitting, cursing, and shouting non-stop, while their family members were mixed among them, shedding tears. Before boarding the plane, each person was weighed. The large Tang Yangdu was the heaviest, at 90 kilograms, while the scholar Zhou Zuoren was the lightest, at 52 kilograms. Each person was allowed to carry 15 kilograms of belongings, mostly clothing, bedding, books, and sewing kits. Zhou carried his own book, "Tan Shi Ji," while Yu Jinhe carried the Diamond Sutra. At around 10:30 AM, the group of traitors departed from Beiping, where they once wielded power and influence. It is also learned that the traitors in prison are allowed to see their families once a month, receive items once, and the most money is sent by the economic traitor Zou Quansun, 200,000 yuan each time, and the least is Zhou Zuoren, 5,000 yuan each time. Furthermore, according to Deng Zhexi, President of the Hebei High Court, the sentence of a person convicted of treason is calculated from the date of their arrest.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Beiping, 26th] The great traitors Wang Yintai, Jiang Kanghu, Qi Xieyuan, Yu Jinhe, Yin Rugeng, Pan Yugui, Wang Shijing, Tang Yangdu, Wen Zhimu, Zhou Zuoren, Chen Zengshi, Wang Mo, Liu Yushu, Zou Quansun and 14 others were escorted by Ni Chaofan, Director of the Investigation Department of the Garrison Headquarters, at 10:45 AM on the 26th, and were transferred to Nanjing for trial by plane.</p>
<h3 id="e2">The Original Text of the Re-Trial Approval of Chen Bijun's Life Sentence <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Suzhou Correspondent] Jiang Chen Bijun, the traitorous wife of the great traitor Wang Zhaoming of the puppet Nanjing government, was sent by the Military Affairs Commission to the Suzhou High Court for investigation and trial. On April 22nd, she was sentenced to life imprisonment, deprived of civil rights for life, and all her property, except for a reasonable amount for the necessary living expenses of her family, was confiscated. Upon hearing the verdict, Chen stated in court that she did not accept it, but did not want a re-trial. Her daughter, Wang Wenxun, appealed on behalf of her mother, requesting a re-trial. The Suzhou High Court also submitted a request for review. The Supreme Court rendered its verdict on May 17th, with the main text stating: "The original judgment is approved, and she is still sentenced to life imprisonment." The re-trial document has arrived in Suzhou and has been sent to the defendant, and the execution will be carried out in the Jiangsu Third Prison at Shizikou on a scheduled date. This female traitor will be imprisoned for life. The original text of the Supreme Court's re-trial document is recorded below:</p>
<p>Special Criminal Judgment of the Supreme Court, Jing Te Fu No. 139 of the 35th Year. Defendant Chen Bijun, female, 56 years old, residing at No. 30, Fazheng Road, Guangzhou City.</p>
<p>The defendant listed above was sentenced by the Jiangsu High Court on April 22nd, 35th year of the Republic of China, for the crime of treason, and sent for re-trial. The judgment of this court is as follows:</p>
<p>(Main Text) The original judgment is approved.</p>
<p>(Reasons) The defendant in this case, Chen Bijun, is the wife of the late traitor Wang Zhaoming, and was originally a member of the Central Supervisory Committee of the Kuomintang. After the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, she initially followed Wang to Chongqing. Later, due to the initial setbacks in our war effort, Wang's will weakened, and he colluded with Japanese chieftain Konoe Fumimaro, secretly seeking peace. The defendant also participated in the deliberations. In December of the 27th year of the Republic of China, she followed Wang from Chongqing to Hanoi, Vietnam. First, she sent Chen Gongbo and others to Hong Kong to publish a flashy telegram in response to Konoe's proposed three principles of peace. Then, she and Wang traveled from Hanoi to Hong Kong, and then to Shanghai to negotiate the basic plan for Sino-Japanese peace with the enemy. On March 30th of the 29th year of the Republic of China, they organized the puppet National Government in Nanjing. Wang served as the puppet chairman, and the defendant served as a member of the puppet National Party Central Supervisory Committee and a member of the puppet Central Political Committee. She was also assigned to guide and liaise with the puppet party, government, and military affairs in the southwestern provinces. She and her younger brother, the late puppet Governor of Guangdong Province, Chen Yaozu, under the command of Japanese enemies Yazaki and Sakai, handled Guangdong's political affairs until the enemy surrendered before being dismissed from her position. These facts were repeatedly confessed by the defendant and are consistent with the statements of Chen Gongbo and Chu Minyi in other cases. There are also seized special appointment letters and identity cards issued by the enemy military intelligence agency and the Guangdong Provincial Government, as well as telegrams from Chen Yaozu to the defendant using the code names "Cliff" and "Hua" to report and request instructions, which are sufficient to prove that she colluded with the enemy country and plotted to resist this country, and the facts are extremely obvious. The defendant's defenses were nothing more than saying that Wang initially agreed with the war of resistance, but later saw that the war could not be sustained and China could not be saved, and that the opportunity for peace had arrived, so he still upheld his long-held ambition to save the country and the people and resolutely advocated peace. He repeatedly suggested this, but the central government never adopted it, so he had no choice but to leave Chongqing and discuss peace terms with the Japanese invaders. His mission was more complicated and arduous than the war of resistance. As for the organization of the puppet National Government, it was because there was a temporary government in the north and a restoration government in the south at that time, and the powers could not be unified, and the people were in dire straits, so this move had to be taken. Wang did not dare to call himself chairman, but used the name of acting chairman to preside over government affairs, and it is very clear that he had no intention of resisting this country. After the July 7th Incident, our government adopted the long-term war of resistance as its national policy and repeatedly announced it to China and foreign countries. However, Wang's will was weak, and when he saw the initial setbacks in the war, his confidence wavered sharply. Without waiting for the government's orders or consent, he brazenly made peace with the enemy chieftain. The basic plan for Sino-Japanese peace that he signed was full of terms that humiliated the country and forfeited its sovereignty. The fact that he colluded with the enemy country cannot be explained away, no matter how much he tries. Although various coastal areas successively fell, our government still existed. Wang actually organized a puppet government in Nanjing with the support of the enemy, forming a confrontational situation with the central government. It cannot be said that he had no intention of resisting this country. The defendant participated in the planning of Wang's plan, and also took on important positions. She cannot escape the crime of colluding with the enemy country and plotting to resist this country. The defendant's assertion that Wang's advocacy of peace was aimed at saving the country is self-deception. As for the defendant's preservation of many valuable specimens and various books for the Central Research Institute in Guangdong, and her efforts to negotiate with the enemy to stabilize rice prices and save 400,000 refugees, regardless of whether these claims are true, still need to be proven. Even if they are not false, they have no impact on the establishment of the crime. The original judgment held that the defendant's actions should bear the responsibility for colluding with the enemy country and plotting to resist this country. Because of her relationship with Wang, she echoed her husband's schemes without realizing it, which is fundamentally different from ordinary crimes. It is not entirely unforgivable for her to face death. Except for the section where the defendant was in charge of special operations in the Southwest, which was deemed that the crime could not be proven and was not discussed, the first article, the first item of the second article, the first item of the eighth article, the ninth article of the Regulations on the Punishment of Traitors, the first paragraph of the second article, the twenty-eighth article, and the thirty-seventh article, the court sentenced her to life imprisonment, deprived her of civil rights for life, and confiscated all her property except for a reasonable amount for the necessary living expenses of her family, which is in accordance with the law and should be approved.</p>
<p>Based on the above conclusions, the judgment is made according to the first paragraph of the twentieth article of the Special Criminal Cases Litigation Regulations, as in the main text.</p>
<p>Criminal Second Tribunal of the Supreme Court of the Republic of China on May 17, 35th year. Chief Judge Zhang Yuzhi, Judge Yin Yuebo, Judge Lin Shangbin, Judge Luo Renji, Judge Chen Shicheng.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 26th] Japanese war criminals Sakai Takashi and Takahashi Tane, were members of the Japanese army dedicated to invading China. From the 26th to the 35th year of the Republic of China, Sakai Takashi served as the Chief of Staff of the Tianjin Japanese Garrison Army, and Takahashi Tane served as the Japanese Military Attaché in Beiping. At that time, Japan was attempting to separate the five provinces of North China from the central government. Sakai and Takahashi were important members of the execution of this policy. On the one hand, they sheltered drug trafficking and smuggling, disrupting social economy and security, and on the other hand, they used various vicious and sinister means to oppress and threaten the military and political authorities in North China. Their overbearing, arrogant, unreasonable attitude and actions were truly unbearable. At that time, Commander-in-Chief He Yingqin served as the Acting Chairman of the Beiping Branch of the Military Commission, and knew this in great detail. After the Lugouqiao Incident, Sakai Takashi was promoted to the Commander of the 43rd Army and the Commander of the Hong Kong Garrison Army. Takahashi Tane was promoted to the Chief of Staff of the North China Front Army, commanding operations on the Chinese battlefield. Their crimes against Chinese and foreign people are innumerable. Sakai Takashi had already been arrested by the Army Headquarters and detained in the war criminal detention center. Takahashi Tane was also detained by the Army Headquarters on the 25th and sent to the war criminal detention center. The military court has now collected various pieces of evidence and is about to file a public prosecution for trial in accordance with the law.</p>

<p>Unlimited Joy at Philippine Independence</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Qingdao, 26th] China's naval construction is moving forward. Here, the Central Naval Training Corps, with the assistance of American advisors, is cultivating intermediate cadres. Six hundred people have already been sent to serve on American landing ships. More than twenty landing ships and other warships have already been docked at Qingdao port, and are being handed over to the Chinese Navy for use. After graduating from the Naval Academy, members of the Sea Training Corps come to Qingdao for training. The scale is similar to that of a naval specialized school, divided into Radar, Navigation, Anti-Submarine, Electrical, Mechanical, Signals, Gun, Artillery, Torpedo, Ship Police, and Wireless Telegraph classes. In addition to lecturing on new naval tactics and related sciences, American advisors provide practical guidance on new naval equipment.

<h3 id="e9">The Story of the Arrest of Enemy Spy Zhang Xiaolong in Nanjing <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 26th] The traitor Zhang Xiaolong was arrested in this city on the 25th. It is reported that the traitor's ancestral home is Nanling, Anhui, and he moved to Shenyang. He graduated from the Japanese Imperial University. After the fall of Nanjing, he went to Tunxi to work in the Anhui-Jiangxi Black Tea Transportation Committee, and later went to Hong Kong. In the 31st year, he went to Shanghai to join the enemy, and served as the Chief of the Secret Service of the Shanghai Enemy Gendarmerie and a translator for the Mei Kikan. He plotted to harm many underground workers of our party. The arrest of Mr. Jiang Bocheng and Mrs. Yang Hu was also due to his secret reports. He was extremely lecherous and frequented dance halls, spending lavishly. After the victory, relying on his cousin Zhang Yan's involvement in the handover at the Logistics Department, he got to know Wang Zhuozhang, the director of the department. Because he had money, he was appointed as the Lieutenant Colonel Deputy Warehouse Chief of a certain warehouse in Zhenjiang in the Logistics Department under the false name of Wu Xinhua (this is his confession). He always carried two short guns and an orderly, and had his own Jeep. A week ago, he came to Nanjing and stayed at the Oriental Hotel, and then moved to Zijin Lane in Dawa Lane. A certain agency had been tracking him and saw him entertaining guests at the Paris Restaurant. An officer believed that the time was ripe, so he led several plainclothes agents to the restaurant to arrest him. When the officer drew his gun, the traitor tried to snatch the gun and escape. The officer's hands were scratched, and after a two-minute struggle, he was finally arrested. Among those sitting with the traitor at the Little Paris Restaurant yesterday were Director Yu of the Nanjing Office of the Central Military Academy, and the traitor's wife, siblings, and eight other people.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Kaifeng, 25th] After the National Water Conservancy Commission and representatives of the Chinese Communist Party reached an agreement in Nanjing on the Yellow River blocking and restoration project, it was decided to start construction separately on June 5th. The embankment restoration project in the government area that has already started is being intensified. The Huayuankou blocking project is currently underway, but the closing must be done after the entire embankment restoration project is completed, and it is difficult to close before the flood season. Another important task of the Yellow River Water Conservancy Commission is to protect the flood banks and Shahe embankments to prevent the expansion of the flood area. Chairman Zhao Shouyu went to Zhoukou on the 24th to inspect the Shahe embankment protection situation and presided over a meeting in Zhoukou to requisition construction materials. He will return to Huayuankou in the coming days to supervise the work. It is reported that 70% of the Shahe embankment protection project has been completed and can be completed by the end of June. The breaches at Guodang and Da Wu on the eastern Yellow River embankment have been repaired and the embankment protection work is underway. The embankment protection project on the western Yellow River embankment has also been 60% completed. It is expected that the embankment protection project will be completed soon, and the flood area will not expand during the flood season.</p>

<p>(United Press, New York, 25th) Mr. Vanderhoof, president of the American Textile Export Association, told a United Press reporter that to help China restore its pre-war export markets, we should assist China in establishing its textile industry. At the same time, Japan should not be supplied with sufficient raw cotton to engage in large-scale textile manufacturing. Mr. Vanderhoof stated that the raw cotton supplied to Japan should not exceed 35% of its domestic needs. These manufactured goods, comprising 35%, should be distributed to various countries in the Far East. Mr. Vanderhoof believes that allowing Japan to monopolize the world textile market again would enable Japan to acquire armaments for waging war.</p>
<h3 id="e15">Special Broadcast by the American Foreign Policy Association Debates the China Situation: Vincent, Judd, Tracy <a href="#e15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>[US News Service, Springfield, Massachusetts, 25th] Mr. Vincent, Director of the Far Eastern Affairs Department of the State Department, Congressman Judd, a Republican from Minnesota, and Congressman Tracy, a Democrat from Washington (both highly regarded experts on China issues), tonight discussed on National Broadcasting Company radio, in this city, the problems the United States faces in completing the process of a "unified and democratic China" as stipulated in last December's Moscow Conference of Foreign Ministers from the United Kingdom, America and the Soviet Union. This broadcast was one in a series of programs by the National Broadcasting Company on "Our Foreign Policy" and was a special broadcast from this location by the Foreign Policy Association during its meeting on Thursday. The debate between Congressman Judd and Congressman Tracy centered on the issue of responsibility for the recent split between the Kuomintang (Nationalist Party) and the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). Mr. Vincent adopted an objective viewpoint, summarizing the policies and motivations of the US government as follows:</p>
<p>"Our efforts to assist China in achieving peace and unification are not solely based on altruism. These efforts are actually to promote national and international interests, because the lack of unity in China encouraged the Japanese aggressors in 1931 and directly caused our full-scale war in 1941. Congressman Judd pointed out that it is absolutely true that we must advocate for China's independence and the integrity of its territory and administration, but we cannot solely rely on the Open Door Policy and the Nine-Power Treaty. We must actively strive to create a strong and unified China. The current question is not whether our efforts will immediately achieve China's unification, but whether we can abandon our efforts in view of the obvious difficulties. I believe that, as Marshal Marshall advocates, the policy of working towards China's unification through peaceful means, its reverse is to support the existing government to achieve unification by force, but forceful unification contains the undesirable possibility that China will be divided into two opposing camps, which will seriously hinder all constructive policies in the Far East.</p>
<p>"Therefore, I deeply feel that we should maintain a neutral position, without favoring any political party in China, and support General Marshall's arduous work so that the United States, China, and the international community can all greatly benefit." All the speakers trust Marshal Marshall, because his work has made progress, and he has indicated that he can help China resolve the current situation. The speakers also reviewed China's internal difficulties. Mr. Vincent said that before the President's policy statement in December last year was issued, the President had discussed it in detail with Marshal Marshall. The President's policy statement in December: to urge China to stop internal strife, organize a coalition government, and unify military commands, is the main goal of the United States in China. Mr. Vincent said that the issue of ceasing the civil war was discussed at that time. The truce negotiations concluded on January 10, deciding to cease all military conflicts and military movements. In addition, the Chinese government also convened the Political Consultative Conference in Chongqing, and representatives from various parties and factions participated, including representatives from the Communist Party and the China Democratic League. When asked what agreements the Consultative Conference had reached, Mr. Vincent replied: The Consultative Conference decided to organize a coalition government and formulate a democratic constitution, guaranteeing freedom of person, speech, assembly, and publication, and recognizing that all political parties have equal legal status. In addition, agreements were reached on holding elections and promoting local autonomy. The Political Consultative Conference was a comprehensive meeting for China and a major step for China towards democracy. The speakers then mentioned the reasons for the resurgence of internal strife in China after the Consultative Conference. Congressman Judd pointed out: "The CCP has repeatedly violated the agreements." Mr. Tracy said: "Both sides are to blame for the resurgence of internal strife. I believe it is a fact that the Kuomintang side has violated the agreement more often."</p>
<p>Mr. Tracy said: "I believe the United States should use all its strength and prestige to promote peace in China and should not favor any party during the civil war." Congressman Judd said: "Since the current situation is so complicated and threatens world peace, I believe that for the sake of the parties involved, if they can agree, the Northeast of China can be temporarily placed under the joint rule of the United Nations before the true unification of China is realized." Mr. Tracy said: "We should not forget that the people of Northeast China have been under the iron heel of the Japanese since 1931, for a longer time than anyone else in China. They are eager to gain freedom, and they do not want to be conquered by foreigners again, even if their new conquerors are Chinese." Mr. Tracy then said: "There are major reasons for the breakdown of the truce agreement. I believe this matter cannot be clearly separated from the great power politics of the world. If the great powers fail to cooperate to seek peace, especially the United States and the Soviet Union, if they fail to work together, how can we expect China or anyone inclined towards fascism to be willing to give up any rights they have enjoyed for a long time?" Mr. Vincent then reviewed the policies of the United States and the Soviet Union in China. He said: "Our policy naturally regards the central government as the legal government of China. The assistance we give to China is aimed at the central government, not the Communist Party. The Soviet Union's policy is also the same, as can be seen from the agreement signed between the Soviet Union and the central government in August last year. However, in any case, the assistance we provide to the central government is certainly not intended to be used for internal war." Regarding the issue of the former Japanese factories in Northeast China, Mr. Vincent said: "We have lodged a strong protest with the Soviet Union against the removal of the factories of the former Japanese in Northeast China. They have a different interpretation of the spoils of war (they refer to these industries as spoils of war), and it is completely wrong. The disposal of factories operated by the former Japanese should be governed by the Allied overall compensation agreement, and this is not a matter for any one country." As for the attitude of American public opinion towards the future of China, Mr. Vincent said: "American public opinion urgently hopes that China can produce a democratic coalition government and unanimously recognize that the Soviet Union should cooperate to formulate a policy towards China and the entire Far East."</p>

<h3 id="e16">Pauley's Mission to the East <a href="#e16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>President Truman's special envoy for reparations issues, Mr. Pauley, commissioned to come to the Far East to conduct an on-the-spot investigation of the materials and industrial equipment in Korea and Northeast China, arrived in Shanghai yesterday. According to Pauley's statement to the press when he arrived in Tokyo on the 10th of this month, "The main task of this trip to the Far East is to investigate the scope of the industrial equipment removed by the Soviet Union from that region. All assets previously owned by Japan within China and Korea should belong to those countries. This is the goal of American policy." From this, we can see the importance of Pauley's mission. Before Pauley set off for the East, the American media believed that Pauley's investigation would cause a conflict of economic interests between the United States and the Soviet Union in the Far East. Later, Pauley entered the Soviet-occupied area of northern Korea from the US-occupied area of southern Korea on the 16th to carry out investigation work. On the 24th, he flew from Seoul to Nanjing, the capital of our country, to visit our authorities, discuss active investigation methods, and frankly stated to the press: "The heavy industrial equipment in the Northeast has been completely removed by the Soviet Union, and it is difficult to hope that things can be returned to their original places." When he said this, he could not help but feel a little frustrated. When we heard this, we felt even more melancholy and disappointed.</p>
<p>Regarding the Northeast issue, it was resolved as early as the Cairo Conference. In the declaration jointly issued by the three giants, Roosevelt, Churchill, and Chiang, it was publicly announced that Northeast China, Taiwan, and the Ryukyu Islands would be returned to China. After President Roosevelt returned to the country, he reported on the long-term plan for the Far East decided at the Cairo Conference, which also included the principle of "returning property to its original owners." Therefore, after Japan surrendered, we all thought that the withdrawal of Soviet troops and the takeover of the Northeast by the Chinese government would not be a problem, but we did not know that the secret Yalta Agreement already existed, which imposed some restrictions on our country's restoration of sovereignty over the Northeast: (1) Dalian was opened as an international port, and the Soviet Union retained preferential rights; Lushun was leased by the Soviet Union as a naval base; (2) the Chinese Eastern Railway and the South Manchurian Railway were jointly managed by China and the Soviet Union, and the Soviet Union retained preferential rights. In order to appease people, the Chinese government followed the provisions of the secret Yalta Agreement, at the cost of significant compensation, and signed a treaty of friendship between the two countries in order to maintain peace in the Far East. However, the ink on the Sino-Soviet treaty was not yet dry, and the Soviet Union's actions in the Northeast that violated the agreement were endless. The most incomprehensible thing is that the Soviet Union removed all the heavy industrial equipment in the Northeast, leaving only an empty shell for us to take over. According to estimates by American mining experts, the industrial equipment removed by the Soviet Union from the Northeast is worth at least 500 million US dollars. If China wants to replenish this equipment, it will take at least two years. However, the Soviet Union took this action and claimed that "all Japanese enterprises in the Northeast provinces that once served the Kwantung Army should be regarded as spoils of war of the Soviet Army." This kind of sophistry has no sufficient reason and violates international law, no wonder it will cause protests from our country and interference from the United Kingdom and the United States.</p>
<p>First, on February 9th of this year, US Secretary of State Byrnes sent notes to the governments of China and the Soviet Union, stating two things: (1) Opposing the joint management of Northeast industry by China and the Soviet Union, the current negotiations between the two countries are tantamount to violating the United States' "Open Door" policy; (2) Northeast industry and the Japanese reparations issue are closely related, and they cannot be regarded as spoils of war and removed. Later, the United Kingdom followed the example of the United States and made the same representations to the Soviet Union. However, the Soviet Union has always ignored it, so the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union are in a stalemate on this issue. On the British and American side, it is argued that the industrial equipment removed by the Soviet army in the Northeast should be used as capital for Japanese reparations; while the Soviet Union believes that this is the spoils of war of the Soviet army and can be removed, and the remaining industry should be jointly operated by China and the Soviet Union. The two sides each held their own views and refused to give in, forming a serious international problem in the Far East.</p>
<p>As for our country's attitude towards this issue, Foreign Minister Wang Shijie had already announced to the outside world: "China has resisted the longest and suffered the greatest losses, so China should enjoy a superior proportional amount in the total amount of Japanese reparations to the Allied countries; and should have the right to obtain priority. All Japanese public and private industries within China should be regarded as part of Japan's reparations to China." At the same time, China also expressed its disagreement with the Soviet Union's view that Northeast industry was the spoils of war of the Soviet army, and has formally notified the United Kingdom and the United States, which has won praise from the British and American press. For example, the London Times reported: "We have always believed that China has been ravaged by Japanese aggression and is the holder of sovereignty over the nine northeastern provinces, so the legitimate custodian of this industrial equipment is none other than China." The British Labour Party's Daily Herald also reported: "After this matter is investigated, it can be proved that most of the factories in the Northeast are not owned by Japan, but are the legitimate property of China." From this, we can see that our country's position is justified and strong, and cannot be overturned; we hope that Pauley will come to China, and will listen to the opinions of the government and the public in our country.</p>
<p>Let us put aside the legal and historical factors for the time being, and observe it from an economic point of view alone. The Soviet Union's removal of industrial equipment from the Northeast is not very beneficial to the Soviet Union itself, but just a pile of scrap metal. But if it is not removed and remains in place, it will be of great benefit to the local economy. Therefore, Pauley said: "The United States wants this equipment and materials to continue to produce for local security and world peace; and believes that if this equipment remains in place, its value will be 100%, and once it is moved, its value will be less than one-tenth of the original." The Soviet Union's removal of industrial equipment from the Northeast is really a "harmful and unprofitable" thing. After Pauley conducts an on-the-spot investigation in the Northeast, he should try to "return things to their original places" to realize the American proposition, that is, he must allow all kinds of industrial equipment that can affect the economy of the Northeast to be allowed to be moved. Pauley said that it is difficult to hope that things can be returned to their original places, isn't that too pessimistic? Man proposes, God disposes. Aren't sixty-two American celebrities and scholars shouting loudly, demanding the abandonment of the secret Yalta Agreement?</p>
<p>In short, the Northeast industrial equipment issue is the most important part of the Japanese reparations issue. If the United Kingdom and the United States and the Soviet Union cannot reach a consensus on this issue, then the Japanese reparations issue will be even more difficult to resolve. Recently, the US-Soviet Commission in Korea discussed the unification of the north and south occupied areas, and it broke up again unhappily. It is obvious that the United States and the Soviet Union are standing in an opposing position everywhere in the Far East. If this sad situation is not remedied, the consequences will be endless and unimaginable. All people who are eager for the Far East to live in peace after the war are eager for the United States and the Soviet Union to cease their disputes and be able to treat each other sincerely in everything without suspecting each other, then all disputes can be easily resolved. British Prime Minister Attlee gave a speech yesterday, calling for world peace and asking mankind to eliminate individual selfishness, partisan selfishness, and national selfishness. If the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union can truly do this, then international cooperation will not be difficult to achieve. Today's Far East is like today's world. The summary of the problem is entirely that the Soviet Union's arbitrary actions have caused the United Kingdom and the United States to distrust, or at least not understand. Former US Undersecretary of State Welles openly criticized the unstable situation in the Far East as being entirely due to the failure of the US and the Soviet Union to reach an understanding, which is especially to the point. Therefore, in addition to hoping that Pauley can complete his mission, we also hope that Pauley can do more and do more work to promote the understanding between the United States and the Soviet Union in order to break the current Far Eastern deadlock, which will not only benefit the Far East, but also have a great benefit to world peace.</p>

<p>Silk Farmer Commits Suicide Due to Debt</p>
<p>In Linping Town, Hangzhou County, this year, farmers enthusiastically raised spring silkworms, but mulberry leaves were expensive, costing over ten thousand yuan per dan (a unit of weight), forcing them to borrow money to buy leaves. Unexpectedly, after harvesting the cocoons, the price of cocoons fell, resulting in significant losses. Recently, a farmer surnamed Mou, facing urgent debt collection for the leaves, carried cocoons to the market to sell. However, the cocoon businesses all cited the decline in Shanghai silk prices and refused to buy, citing a lack of funds. The farmer returned with the cocoons, and the creditors remained, demanding payment. His wife, feeling pressured and desperate, hanged herself upstairs. It is indeed tragic.</p>
<p>City Gazetteer Compilation Office to Be Established Next Month</p>

<p>Salt Pan Destruction Leads to Lawsuit</p>
<p>The residents of Qibao Waitang, outside Genshanmen in this city, suffered the destruction of their homes due to a tidal surge in 1940. Unable to make a living, they relocated to the sandy land along the river in Shibao to set up salt pans to make a living. Recently, the salt authorities dispatched police to seal the salt pans, arrest salt workers, and confiscate salt. They ordered the salt workers to surrender their salt and issued a salt price of two thousand yuan. The salt workers, whose production costs were over a thousand yuan per dan, were alarmed. They petitioned the Hangzhou County Government Salt Production Cooperative to urgently seek a solution for their livelihood. The other day, the Minsheng Company, together with the Qibao office of the Salt Management Bureau, led police to the area, destroyed the salt pans, shattered the jars, and injured two women, Gong and Hu. This aroused public outrage, and representatives were elected to file a lawsuit with the Hangzhou District Court.</p>

<p>County Government Punishes Illegal Rice Merchants</p>
<p>The market price of grain in this county has recently fallen from over 60,000 yuan to 50,000 yuan, while the retail price remains at 57,000 to 58,000 yuan. This violates the county government's and the grain guild's regulations, which stipulate that a legal profit of no more than 2,000 yuan can be added to the market price. It is evident that unscrupulous merchants are seeking exorbitant profits. The county government, unwilling to remain silent on this situation, ordered the responsible department to send personnel to secretly investigate rice shops engaged in illegal operations. After confirming evidence against 24 rice shops, they were arrested and detained for over ten hours. On the afternoon of the 24th, they were released on bail by the entire grain guild. However, the county government stated that it would continue to investigate and prosecute them according to the law, without leniency.</p>

<p>Tax Bureau's Obstruction Prompts Manufacturers to Petition</p>
<p>Cloth factories have recently faced various difficulties when taking their yarn tax bills to the goods tax bureau to exchange them after weaving cloth, which has affected production. On the 22nd, the factories sent 15 representatives to the tax bureau to petition, and also requested assistance from the Chamber of Commerce. However, the petition was unsuccessful that day. The tax bureau requires a tax of 300 yuan per bolt, while the manufacturers are only willing to pay 50 yuan, a significant difference. Furthermore, the Tobacco Industry Association stated that the goods tax bureau collected over 5.5 million yuan in inventory tax, which has been approved for exemption by the Ministry of Finance, but has not been refunded for three months. They have separately petitioned various authorities, appealing for redress.</p>

<p>Requesting Grain Loans to Purchase Rice for Famine Relief</p>
<p>The Provisional County Assembly, noting that rice prices have been rising in various places, affecting the people's livelihood, and attributing the cause to frequent years of famine and a shortage of rice, as well as the procurement of military grain, which cannot meet demand, stated that the recent issuance of large grain loans in Shanghai was originally intended to help merchants and the people. However, grain merchants are using these large sums to hoard grain in nearby areas, stimulating grain prices and being the main cause of rising prices. On the 23rd, they telegraphed the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Food, urging them to quickly use these large grain loans to purchase foreign rice to relieve the famine and stabilize rice prices.</p>

<p>The Provincial Hygiene Office, in order to prevent infectious diseases, is managing hygiene-related shops, such as restaurants, candy stores, barbershops, bathhouses, teahouses, live rice and meat stores, sugar workshops, sauce workshops, inns, hotels, and entertainment venues. The persons in charge of each shop should apply for registration with the office from June 1st to June 30th. After passing the inspection, a hygiene license will be issued, allowing them to operate. Otherwise, they will be banned.</p>
<p>Standard Rent and Security Deposit Determined</p>
<p>Since the recovery of the provincial capital, serious panic has arisen. Homeowners regard their properties as rare commodities, arbitrarily raising rents and causing rental disputes. The Provisional Assembly of this county is paying great attention to this. On the 24th, an emergency meeting was held to propose two measures: (1) Based on the rent values in this county in 1937 and comparing them with the situations in Nanjing and Shanghai, the standard rent should be two-thirds lower. Referring to the recent discussions of the Shanghai Provisional Assembly, the rent should be 140 times the rate for residential properties and 180 times the rate for commercial properties. Therefore, the standard for calculating rent in this county should be three times the rent in 1937, and then, according to the Shanghai Provisional Assembly's proposed methods, residential rents should increase by 420 times, and commercial rents should increase by 540 times. (2) The security deposit should be standardized at three months' rent. This resolution has been recorded and notified to the Zhenjiang County Government for implementation.</p>

<h3 id="e18">Railroad Strike Declared Resolved, US National Transportation Returns to Normal, Coal Mine Strike Truce Expires and Attracts Attention Again, Shipyard Workers Set Strike for Next Month <a href="#e18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>[US News Agency, Washington, 25th] The nationwide railroad strike, which began 48 hours ago, was declared resolved this afternoon. The announcement of the resolution of the railroad strike occurred almost simultaneously with the President's commencement of his speech at a joint session of Congress. The President, while reading his speech, was unaware that the strike had been resolved. Upon receiving the news, he stopped reading his speech and announced to Congress that the strike had been resolved. Railroads throughout the United States immediately resumed service after the strike was announced resolved. However, it is uncertain whether the morale of the workers will fully recover within a day or two. Mail delivery also returned to normal shortly after the strike was resolved. The news of the strike's resolution was announced by Presidential Advisor Steelman, who was the government-appointed representative attending the labor-management negotiations. The main points of the agreement to resolve the strike are: an increase of sixteen cents per hour, as recommended by the previous fact-finding committee, retroactive to January 1st of this year, plus an additional two and a half cents per hour, effective May 22nd, and an extension of the revised employee service regulations for one year.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 25th] The two-day nationwide railroad strike was resolved after railroad unions accepted the President's terms, and declared resumption of work just before President Truman asked Congress to pass a transportation bill permitting penalties for strikes against government-seized industries. However, while the railroad strike has been resolved, the strike of 400,000 bituminous coal miners has again attracted attention. Interior Secretary Krug, the current manager of the seized bituminous coal mines, announced today that no agreement has been reached with the coal miners' union leader, Lewis. The two-week truce in the bituminous coal miners' strike expires today. Krug has appealed to the miners to continue working on Sunday while awaiting a solution. The temporary bill that President Truman requested Congress to pass to deal with the railroad strike is no longer needed, but the House of Representatives has passed the Senate's temporary bill at an extraordinary speed of 306 votes to 32. Its content is exactly as proposed by Truman, stipulating that union leaders who refuse to declare a resumption of work in industries seized by the government are subject to fines and imprisonment. Nationwide railroads have begun to restore normal operations, all emergency measures ordered by the government have been lifted, and post offices have also announced that they will resume normal operations.</p>
<p>[French News Agency, Washington, 25th] The Senate has passed a bill by a majority of 54 votes to 26, stipulating that workers who wish to strike must first announce it 60 days in advance through the relevant union, otherwise strikes are not allowed.</p>
<p>[French News Agency, Washington, 25th] American shipyard workers, who demanded a 30% wage increase but were denied, have scheduled a general strike to begin on June 15th. As a precaution, the Secretary of Labor has scheduled a meeting for the 29th of this month, bringing together representatives from various shipping companies, dockworkers' unions, and the wartime transportation bureau. The US government's position on this matter is currently unknown to outsiders.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 25th] President Truman delivered a vigorous speech calling on Congress to pass a "strong bill" to prevent labor unrest such as the railroad strike. He called this a "national disaster." Truman asked Congress to cooperate with him and "act quickly," and requested authorization to draft into service those who launch strikes against the government. He also accused the leaders of the two railroad mechanical and service workers' unions, Johnston and Whitty, of endangering the lives of the people and starving those awaiting aid.</p>

<p>[French News Agency, 25th, Edinburgh, UK] British Prime Minister Attlee delivered a speech at the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland, stating: The world wants peace, but fears war and pacifism. Pacifism merely evades responsibility and cannot bring peace. Only when all men, women, and children have a positive view of human life, and strive for all mankind with the spirit of sacrifice in wartime, can there be peace in the world. We have experienced two world wars, especially this "total war," which has caused a decline in human morality. In today's world, the spiritual evils caused by Hitlerism have not yet been cleared. Hitler denied truth and justice, lacked compassion and love. The Nazis liquidated millions of Jews, their cruelty is beyond description, and its poison continues to this day. Representatives from all countries gathered in San Francisco to reorganize the body of civilization and draft the United Nations Charter with lofty ideals, but we must continue to work hard before these ideals are realized. The world today needs spiritual pioneers, and the Labor Party in power is serving these people, knowing that your service to the church is essential for these people. All church beliefs need not be the same, unity must be consistent, so that the spiritual value of mankind can be expressed. The thoughts of personal selfishness, party selfishness, and national selfishness can also be eliminated through personal example.</p>

<p>[Reuters, Moscow, 26th] Fiktorov, the international editor of Pravda, wrote an article yesterday condemning Britain's attempt to retain the Polish Second Group Army stationed in Italy "for the future." He stated: British Foreign Secretary Bevin's statement to the House of Commons last Wednesday that the Polish Second Group would be transferred to Britain, preparing to be incorporated into the armed "residential group" of Fei, and then allowed to engage in occupations in Britain or overseas, is actually the so-called Fei's repatriation, which is still retaining its organization "under a new name."</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 26th] The text of the Moscow Pravda criticizing Britain's handling of the Polish military has caused surprise and indignation among British politicians.

The results are of great concern to people here. Indonesian Prime Minister Shari declared at the intelligence meeting yesterday that who can exercise de facto power in Sumatra is the main point of contention between the Dutch and the Indonesians. It is believed that the resolution on the military situation in Sumatra may affect this entire issue. Accelerating the withdrawal of Japanese troops currently under the control of the Allied forces will make the situation there even more acute, as the Dutch military strength in Sumatra is unknown, and the British strength is less than a division.</p>

<h3 id="e33">Nuremberg Tribunal Drafts Verdict, Deciding the Fate of German War Criminals. Once Decided, There Is No Appellate Body, Only the Four-Power Control Council Has the Authority to Commute Sentences. <a href="#e33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>[United Press, Nuremberg, 25th] Six months ago, the trial of twenty-one high-ranking German Nazi officials began with accusations of initiating war and other crimes. To date, the prosecutors from various countries have made statements totaling no less than 2.5 million words, and the documentary evidence submitted is mountainous. The presiding judges will review each document carefully before drafting a verdict to determine the fate of each defendant and six organizations, as well as their roles in the Nazi government. After the verdict is delivered, there is no appellate body. However, the Four-Power Control Council for Germany has the authority to commute sentences and decide when and where the sentences will be carried out. At the beginning of this case, few participants knew how long it would last.</p>
<p>Overturning International Law. If the indictments from various countries had been strictly limited to war crimes and the massacre of millions of European civilians, the trial period could have been greatly shortened. However, in this trial, the United Nations is creating an environment that overturns recognized international law and treaties, including those who waged aggressive war, whether intentional or not. Therefore, the lengthy trial of German Nazism traces back to the Nazi Party's origins twenty-five years ago. Each defendant is accused of participating in a conspiracy to support Hitler and initiate aggressive wars.</p>
<p>Aggressors Are Guilty. In essence, the United Nations intends to prove that those who wage aggressive war are guilty, and those in power who support the initiation of aggressive war are also guilty. The entire apparatus that assisted in aggression, including the German cabinet and the General Staff, are considered criminal organizations. This vast plan has lengthened the trial time, requiring the study of extensive evidence of pre-war German politics. In addition, the evidence of numerous war crimes often lacks clear boundaries. However, these thousands of pages of testimony about pre-war Nazism provide a major lesson for Germans and people around the world. It is undeniable that if people willingly relinquish their political responsibility and accept propaganda that incites hatred and murder without question, the consequences can be seen here, which is the lesson to be learned. As for whether the countries of the world have sufficient interest to read the contents carefully, no one in Nuremberg will be able to answer this question.</p>

<p>[United Press, Amman, 25th] Transjordan, a nation with a history of 5,000 years and a population of 300,000, signed a treaty with Britain a month ago, ending the British mandate over Transjordan and establishing Abdullah as King. Abdullah formally ascended the throne this morning, immediately calling on all Arabs to unite and support him, and for all Arab nations to work together. As is customary for Muslim kings, he only ascended the throne and was not crowned. The actual enthronement ceremony lasted only fourteen minutes and was conducted entirely in Arabic. Among the dignitaries attending the enthronement ceremony were Arab League Secretary-General Azzam, Iraqi Regent Elai, officials from Lebanon, Syria, Saudi Arabia, and British diplomatic and military representatives, all wearing elaborate military uniforms and adorned with medals. The scene was grand and spectacular. Abdullah, dressed in gold and red brocade robes, with a gold-embroidered cloak and a silver-white turban, entered the throne room with dignity. Women were excluded from the palace; female journalists and wives of government officials were also excluded. As Abdullah entered the chamber, Prime Minister Hashim shouted "Long live the King" three times in Arabic. Abdullah then sat on a red chair, flanked by his cabinet members and foreign diplomats, such as Iraqi Said, British High Commissioner for Palestine Creech Jones, British Minister to Transjordan Kirkbride, and Saudi Arabian Minister to Palestine Kohaimi. Foreign Minister Shuraiqi delivered a brief speech praising Transjordan's efforts to unite the Arab nations, saying, "All Arabs worldwide are united and follow Your Majesty, with unprecedented loyalty." Outside the palace, the people cheered endlessly. An official then read out the revised points of the country's laws to the people. As soon as the reading was finished, a soldier from the Arab Legion fired a signal shot from a nearby rooftop. Captain Mis, a British officer of the Legion, waved a scarf to signal the royal artillery unit in the ancient Roman fort on a nearby hill, which fired a 101-gun salute. The King then led the dignitaries to the Marka airfield near Amman, where he inspected the 3,000 soldiers of the Arab Legion for the first time, as well as mechanized units, infantry, cavalry, and finally a camel corps in red, gold, and grass-green uniforms. At noon, the King hosted a banquet for 3,000 guests, with fifty to sixty roasted whole lambs served on large copper platters. After the banquet, the ceremony concluded.</p>

<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 26th] The newly appointed Minister of Commerce and Industry, Niro Hoshijima, told a United Press reporter today that a five-year economic revival plan has been drafted. Major companies and military industries previously managed by financial groups will be divided into numerous independent small industries. These small industries will be adjusted according to the new plan to be interconnected. The Yoshida cabinet will encourage small-scale industries that require minimal capital and raw materials, and will utilize Japanese handicrafts to develop cottage industries. The Nagoya mat factory, which previously employed 10,000 workers, can now be decentralized to rural areas, with one factory specializing in producing wire, another specializing in producing steel strands, and another specializing in producing parts. In short, Japan is now seeking economic revival with the minimum standard, so that Japan can stand up again.</p>

<h3 id="e49">The Soviet Union's New Five-Year Plan - Translated by Our Editorial Department <a href="#e49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>[United Press, New York] Today, the Soviet Union has become the source of all global disputes, whether political or economic. However, in recent months, international politics have obscured the global economic war. Everyone knows about the Soviet Union's Five-Year Plans. The first Five-Year Plan began in 1932, the second in 1937, and the third in 1940, which was interrupted by the war. But you should know that the Soviet Union is now embarking on its fourth, even greater, Five-Year Plan.</p>
<p>What does this new plan include?</p>
<p>According to reports released by Soviet officials, the fourth Five-Year Plan contains five major programs:</p>
<p>(1) Soviet industrial production will increase by 50% compared to pre-war levels;</p>
<p>(2) Mass production of consumer goods;</p>
<p>(3) Expanding the scientific field beyond the borders of the Soviet Union;</p>
<p>(4) Providing funding to develop new and old enterprises valued at 334 billion rubles;</p>
<p>(5) Modernization of Soviet military equipment.</p>
<p>Under the first item, increasing industrial production, the plan aims to increase Soviet steel production by 35% compared to pre-war levels. According to statements released by Soviet officials, the Soviet Union, in view of the restoration and development of the national economy, relies on the increase in steel production. Therefore, the Soviet Union plans to increase pig iron production to 19.5 million tons and steel production to 25.4 million tons. To expand the steel industry, the new plan aims to build 45 new blast furnaces, 45 new open-hearth furnaces, 180 new open-hearth furnaces and converters, 90 new smelting furnaces, and 104 rolling mills.</p>
<p>The fourth Five-Year Plan is expected to increase metal production as follows: steel production will increase 1.6 times compared to pre-war levels, aluminum will increase 2.6 times, zinc will increase 2.5 times, tin will increase 2.7 times, nickel will increase 1.9 times, copper will increase 2.7 times, aluminum will increase 2 times, and lead will increase 2.1 times.</p>
<p>In addition, the new plan aims to increase coal production to 250 million tons per year, oil production to 35.4 million tons, and electricity to 82 billion kilowatt-hours.</p>
<p>Soviet officials anticipate that by 1951, Soviet automobile production will reach 500,000 vehicles per year. In addition, increases in the production of trailers, machines, electrical equipment, and locomotives are also included in the new industrialization plan. At the same time, financial machine tools are expected to increase to 1.3 million units. According to Soviet economists, this number exceeds the number of machine tools in the United States in 1940 by 30%.</p>
<p>In agriculture, the plan not only aims to restore and develop agricultural production, but also to develop animal husbandry and soil conservation. According to figures released by the Soviet government, assuming the total agricultural production in 1932 during the first Five-Year Plan was 100, then the second plan in 1937 was 153, and the third plan in 1940 increased to 177. According to the latest plan, total agricultural production will increase to 225 by 1950. According to a Soviet official, "By the end of the five years, the total grain harvest will increase to 127 million tons, which is 7% more than in 1940."</p>
<p>In addition, sugar beet production will increase to 26 million tons, cotton to 3.1 million tons, flax to 800,000 tons, and sunflower seeds to 3.7 million tons. These figures represent an average increase of 11% to 39% compared to pre-war production.</p>
<p>The Soviet Union has proclaimed this new Five-Year Plan. Whether it will be completed as scheduled remains to be seen in 1951.</p>

<p>[Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Nanjing] Recently, someone inquired about "students who originally studied at schools run by puppet organizations and transferred to inland schools in the rear before the victory of the War of Resistance, and who are now unable to submit academic credentials from their original schools. Is there a remedial measure to verify and confirm their academic records?" The response from the person in charge of the Ministry of Education is as follows: (1) Students who studied at specialized schools or above in the former occupied areas and who went to the rear during the War of Resistance and intended to continue their studies were distributed by the Ministry of Education to various schools as visiting students. After one year of visiting study, if their grades were satisfactory, they were allowed to change to regular students of the visiting school. The procedures were very simple. (2) If the students are unable to submit credentials from their original schools, they can provide details of the original school name, dates of enrollment and departure. If the high school diploma is unavailable, they can explain when they graduated from which school. The Ministry of Education can find a way to verify it. If the academic record is authentic, they can still be changed to regular students in accordance with the regulations. (Foolish)</p>

<p>[Minzhi News Agency, Nanjing] After the Nanjing Lindao University student unrest subsided, a reporter visited Hang Liwu, Deputy Minister of Education, in Nanjing. First, he raised the question that in today's era, when victory has long arrived, educational construction is the foundation of all kinds of construction. Will the Ministry of Education continue to adopt a very strict attitude towards the establishment of private schools, or will it relax the standards and encourage private education to improve and popularize national education? Deputy Minister Hang replied: The Ministry of Education will continue to handle the application procedures for the establishment of private schools at all levels in accordance with previous laws and regulations, and there will be no temporary changes. However, the Ministry of Education will continue to encourage private schools. The Ministry of Education does not support the establishment of new schools within one year, because it is already difficult to enrich and maintain existing schools at the beginning of the restoration. The reporter also discussed the issue of funds with Mr. Hang. If the school's funds are deposited in the national bank as required, then according to recent experience, the funds will be wiped out after a certain period due to the impact of prices, and the school will never have any funds. Has the Ministry of Education considered this? Mr. Hang replied that it is under consideration.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper's Chongqing Special Dispatch] During the Anti-Japanese War, schools in the war zones moved inland, promoting both the quality and quantity of education in Sichuan Province. Now, as the entire country is being reinstated, a large number of schools and cultural institutions are leaving Sichuan. The Sichuan Province Reinstatement and Advancement Association, recognizing the significant impact this has on the development of Sichuan's education and culture, has submitted its opinions to the Ministry of Education. The Ministry has recently responded, comforting the people of Sichuan. The Association's letter to the Ministry and the Ministry's response are recorded below:</p>
<p>Association's Telegram: The Sichuan Province Reinstatement and Advancement Association's opinion telegram, briefly stated: Since the War of Resistance, schools of all levels and various cultural institutions across the country have moved to Sichuan, or have been newly established in Sichuan, resulting in an unprecedented development of Sichuan's culture and education. The number of students has increased annually, and illiteracy has decreased day by day, which is truly commendable. Now, as reinstatement is imminent, all schools and cultural and educational institutions that moved inland or were newly established due to the war will also move out in succession. Without proper planning, not only will Sichuan's culture and education decline sharply, but the losses to the country due to repeated relocations are unimaginable. This Association, assisting the government in reinstatement and construction, respectfully suggests to your ministry: (A) Regarding schools: (1) Please expand the departments of the National Sichuan University and Chongqing University as much as possible, and enhance their facilities to accommodate students who are unable to move out of Sichuan with other universities. (2) Please provide appropriate subsidies to Chengdu's West China Union University and Guanghua University to help them accommodate more students. (3) Please quickly establish the National Southern Sichuan University and Northern Sichuan University to replace Tongji University, Wuhan University, and Northeastern University, which are moving out, in order to cultivate talent widely. (4) Retain the National Chongqing Normal School and the Central Industrial School, and expand and establish various vocational schools as needed in various regions of Sichuan to cultivate technical talent to meet the needs of Sichuan's construction. (5) Please expand the provincial middle schools of Sichuan and private middle schools with outstanding achievements as much as possible, to accommodate students from Sichuan after the reinstatement of national middle schools and middle schools that moved to Sichuan. (B) Regarding science and culture: (1) Please temporarily establish a library, science museum, and museum of a certain scale in both Chengdu and Chongqing. (2) Please retain and continue to operate the scientific research institutions and equipment that moved to Sichuan from the central government as much as possible. (3) Retain the Central Hospital of Chongqing and the Central Public Hospital of Chengdu, and hand them over to Sichuan Province for management. The Relief Administration should allocate medical equipment, materials, and drug manufacturing equipment to improve national health. (C) Regarding cultural industries: (1) Retain and continue to operate the scientific instrument manufacturing plant established by the central government in Sichuan as much as possible. (2) Please order the Sichuan Provincial Department of Education and major bookstores to establish a joint printing plant in Sichuan to supply textbooks needed by schools at all levels in Sichuan. (3) Please retain and establish large-scale paper mills and ink manufacturing plants to meet the needs of government agencies, schools, and organizations. (4) Please establish factories to manufacture printing machines to avoid the difficulties and waste of transporting them from other places. (D) Regarding special circumstances: (1) Please allocate special funds to subsidize schools at all levels in Sichuan to treat professors and lecturers from other provinces who are retained, to prevent a shortage of teachers in Sichuan. (2) All buildings and equipment of schools and cultural institutions at all levels that moved to Sichuan and need to be reinstated should be transferred to Sichuan Province by donation or purchase at a fair price. (3) Please issue a clear decree and set up methods to encourage private individuals to build schools and other cultural institutions to develop culture and education in the inland regions. (4) Please allow Sichuan Province to send students abroad at its own expense, as well as self-funded students, to enrich the talent pool for various construction projects in the province.

<p>(1) Question from Mr. Song:</p>
<p>I joined the sacred War of Resistance for my motherland in the 29th year of the Republic [1940], leaving behind my family and loved one. Upon my victorious return to Shanghai, I learned that my sweetheart from years ago had been betrothed to a businessman by her family. Now that she sees I've returned safely, she confides in me her distress and denounces her fiancé as despicable (indulging in excessive drinking, gambling), and wishes to make a lifelong commitment to me. I ask, is this legally permissible? If my girlfriend's family is unhappy about the dissolution of the engagement, can the engagement still stand? My friend is 24 years old. Can she break away from her family and make her own decisions?</p>
<p>[Answer from lawyer Fu Kuang-lin] Since your friend is an adult, she is certainly entitled to make her own decisions regarding marriage. However, the previous engagement can only be dissolved if it meets one of the conditions listed in Article 976, Paragraph 1, of the Civil Code. While marriage cannot be forcibly compelled, those who violate an engagement without legal justification shall be liable for damages suffered by the other party as a result.</p>
<p>(2) Question from Zou Xiang:</p>
<p>Miss A and Mr. B have been married for over three years (this marriage was arranged by both sets of parents from childhood). Less than a month after the marriage, Miss A returned home. According to Miss A, she left because she was dissatisfied with Mr. B's violent temper and his frequent theft and gambling, making it difficult for them to live together. After Miss A left, she went to work elsewhere to support herself. During this period, Mr. B did not inquire about her or visit her mother's house to discuss the matter. Now, Miss A wants to divorce Mr. B and is willing to forgo recovering her dowry, but Mr. B ignores her and does not say whether he agrees to the divorce or not. I ask: (1) Is Miss A currently free? (2) Is it valid for Miss A to unilaterally declare a divorce in the newspaper? (3) Is a marriage arranged by parents from childhood valid? (4) If I marry Miss A now, am I legally guilty of a crime? (5) After I marry Miss A, can Mr. B interfere with us or sue us?</p>
<p>[Answer from lawyer Fu Kuang-lin] (1) While bodily freedom is protected by law, Miss A cannot marry another person before divorcing Mr. B. (2) No, it is not valid. (3) Having already been married, it is valid. (4) You cannot marry Miss A before she divorces Mr. B. You would be committing bigamy. (5) Mr. B can sue according to the law.</p>
<p>(3) Question from Xu Maogong:</p>
<p>In August of the 25th year of the Republic [1936], a relative was unable to continue his studies. At that time, a philanthropist, Zhu, offered to help with funding until the relative graduated. The philanthropist immediately paid 63 national currency units for tuition and board, saying that if he had the ability in the future, he should repay the money. Therefore, the relative and his father signed a note to Zhu, stating that they had received 63 national currency units, with no interest or other related terms. Soon after, the philanthropist Zhu declared that he could no longer continue to help due to changing circumstances. Although the relative is not yet able to repay the money, he is willing to repay it in the future and retrieve the note. However, the price of goods today is vastly different from what it was then. Should the repayment be based on a multiple of the price index, or is there another method?</p>
<p>[Answer from lawyer Fu Kuang-lin] According to current laws, there is no regulation requiring repayment of old debts based on a multiple of the price index. Unless there is a special agreement between the parties, the original amount can be repaid in legal tender.</p>

<p>To stabilize the food supply, Mayor Wu has invited social figures, heads of relevant agencies, and leading rice merchants to a food conference at the Municipal Government this afternoon at 3:00 PM to discuss how to encourage the purchase and sale of grain and to decide on effective and specific measures to resolve the current food supply problem in a concerted effort between officials and the public, as reported in yesterday's newspaper. It is learned that the City Rice Dealers Association, Bean and Rice Trade, and Miscellaneous Grains Trade three guilds are cooperating with the Municipal Government to stabilize rice prices. A joint emergency meeting of all directors and supervisors was held at the Qingdage Rice Market on Sima Road yesterday (26th) morning at 9:00 AM. Directors and supervisors from all industries attended, and representatives from the Social Bureau, Ji Mingzhai and Cao Bingqian, attended to provide guidance. Xing Zhigang was elected chairman, and he reported on the recent rice market situation and the significance of this meeting. After discussion, eight key points for facilitating the rice supply and stabilizing prices were agreed upon. The chairmen of the three guilds will be delegated to attend the Municipal Government's food conference today (27th) to present the key points for discussion. The eight key points are listed below: (1) Please order the government to protect grain-carrying ships. (2) Please prioritize rice transportation by the railways. (3) Arrange for rice safety insurance. (4) Consult with banks to provide short-term, small-scale grain loans. (5) Please ensure that producing regions no longer restrict the export of rice or impose other obstacles. (6) Please have the government negotiate with grain merchants to purchase foreign rice for shipment to Shanghai. (7) Organize a rice price research group. (8) Before the Municipal Food Conference makes a resolution, market prices this morning (27th) will be stabilized and will not exceed the market price of last Saturday. Although yesterday was a holiday, the social bureau's responsible for food matters department continued to work as usual, as various rice inventory reports needed to be sorted out. Also, today afternoon is the first day of flat-price flour sales, so all preparations must be made.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Mr. Du Yuesheng recently told a reporter from the Huguang News Agency that the prices of goods in Shanghai have been rising wildly recently, especially rice, which is a daily necessity for citizens and should not be manipulated and hoarded by unscrupulous merchants. He believes that not only should the municipal authorities investigate, but the public should also report them so that the entire food supply can return to normal. Mr. Du concluded by saying that he sincerely hopes to help society with his personal efforts under the leadership of Mayor Wu Guozhen. It is reported that Mr. Du is also prepared to attend the food conference convened by the Municipal Government today.</p>

It is also said that he has ordered a large amount of foreign rice from the United States and South American countries. Currently, South America has the best food production situation in the world and has more surplus rice.</p>
<h3 id="e77">Crude Oil for Soap Use Slightly Active <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>The crude oil market has been sluggish and inactive for more than a month. The reason is that speculation has stopped, and soap usage is not strong, so the market has been circling without changing for a long time. The clearance of supply is something unheard of in previous years, so those in this business are not interested. However, it was recently heard that the Guben Soap Factory has handled one to two thousand loads, the price being 47,000 yuan, Sima scale, delivered to the factory, equivalent to only 38,000 yuan on the city scale plus some change. However, sellers still have to lose money, so they still can't get interested. However, the inventory has moved a little, adding a little activity. Yesterday, a Hangzhou merchant arrived with 200 pieces of Neiping oil, which was distributed by each firm, priced at 46,000 yuan. However, this product is not suitable for soap making and is still only used for candles. The selling prices of each firm are 60,000 yuan for the oil that came in by train, 48,000 yuan for Neiping oil, 44,000 yuan for Dike oil, 42,000 yuan for Duzhu oil, 40,000 yuan for Lan oil, and 38,000 yuan for Macheng oil.</p>

<p>[Reuters, Cardiff, 26th] Tinplate industry insiders admit that if the tinplate export industry does not modernize, it may permanently lose the market. Although exports of other steel products are booming, tinplate is declining due to shortages and export restrictions. Before the war, tinplate was the most valuable of British steel products, accounting for 20% of the total. However, exports were greatly reduced during the war, and production fell to 11 million boxes per year.</p>
<h3 id="e79">The Process of Change in the Selling of Woolen Cloth to Visiting Merchants <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>— Maofang</p>
<p>Shanghai is a gathering place for Chinese and foreign merchants, and buyers from all over the country gather here to purchase goods. The changing situation of woollen cloth sales to visiting merchants is briefly described as follows. The first places to purchase woollen cloth from Shanghai were South China and North China. Shops were opened in Shanghai, such as Yishunheng, Yishunsheng, Yongfengli, and Shiyitang. The Guandong merchants were attached to them. The Guangdong-South, Chaoshan, and Xiamen merchants mostly stayed in the Guangdong fruit shops on Tiantong Road in Hongkou, and later gradually rented houses. Next came the Sichuan, Guizhou, Yunnan, Hunan, and Jiangxi merchants, such as Dachuantong, Taiguyu, Yiheyu, Zhaoshangyu, Xiejixing, Huijixing, Yijizhan, Xiangyugong (Xingchanglong, Huyigong, Changsha Commercial Guild, etc.). Other merchants, such as those from Beiping, Tianjin, Qingdao, Yantai, Hankou, Kaifeng, Zhengzhou, Jinan, Xi'an, Dalian, and Jiangxi, mostly came to Shanghai twice a year to purchase goods, buying summer goods in the spring and winter goods in the autumn. They either attached themselves to the shops of acquaintances in the same industry or rented houses in the alleyways, such as Taipingfang, Weishuifang, Juyuanfang, Jingheli, and Taozhuli.</p>
<p>After 1925, the South China merchants needed to purchase less because the prices in Hong Kong were cheaper, so they all changed locations to purchase nearby. At the same time, the Dalian merchants all handled transit goods, because they could collect the same customs duties, so they needed the original delivery notes. Later, because merchants cheated, the government cancelled the tax refund, and the Shanghai shops of that group closed down one after another, while the Chongqing-Chengdu and Tianjin-Beijing Yangtze River merchants greatly increased their purchases. After the government established its capital in Nanjing, the small merchants from Nanjing, Suzhou, Bengbu, Hangzhou, Wenzhou, Jinhua, and Ningbo suddenly strengthened their purchases of woollen cloth, especially those from Nanjing. At the same time, the purchases of the merchants from Guandong and Xingbei suddenly decreased, because many foreign firms in Shanghai had branches in Tianjin, and that group all ordered and sold goods nearby. The purchases of the large and small Sichuan merchants and the Jiangxi merchants increased. After the January 28th Incident in 1932, the sales to visiting merchants changed again. The merchants from the Northeast were hit hard, and they closed their Shanghai shops one after another and left Shanghai. Fortunately, the sales to merchants in the interior increased, and the total sales of woollen cloth were still able to increase without decreasing. After the full-scale War of Resistance began on August 13, 1937, land and water transportation gradually became difficult and then stopped. All the merchants were oppressed by the enemy and puppets, and they all closed down one after another. Many merchant guilds closed and reorganized. During the years of enemy-puppet occupation, except for the three cities of Nanjing, Shanghai, and Hangzhou, there were no other merchants purchasing goods, but the sales of single merchants and Japanese firms increased sharply. Since the victory of the War of Resistance in August of last year, the demand from merchants in various places has gradually increased again. The Chongqing-Chengdu merchants were the first to vigorously purchase, followed by the Tianjin-Beijing and Changsha-Nanjing merchants. In recent times, all have been in the process of recovery. It is expected that starting next spring, when land and water transportation is convenient, woollen cloth sales to visiting merchants will be completely new.</p>
<h3 id="e80">The Current Clothing Problem - Raw Materials and Labor Urgently Need Adjustment - Many Looms are Still Idle <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>[Our Report] Recently, the market price of yarn and cloth has been rising sharply. When the Textile Building Company lists its prices, the number of people asking to open goods is redoubled, and the company prioritizes military supplies, so the approval of goods for opening have been reduced, causing even fewer supplies for private cloth mills and even higher prices. Actually, the number of outside customers is still the same as usual. And, even in the view of the Textile Building, on the 23rd, was opening goods of 60,000+ bolts of cloth, on the 24th, it was 800+ bundles of yarn, on the 25th, it was 55,000 bolts of cloth, the number is still considerable. It seems that the recent price increases have other stimuli besides actual sales. According to textile, dyeing, and cotton cloth businessman, Mr. Pan Shihao, to solve this problem, we should first</p>
<p>Promote Production Capacity: The Textile Building is now the authority in the yarn and cloth industry. Its production capacity can be estimated as follows:</p>
<p>[The section detailing the Textile Building's production capacity is missing, but it indicates that only half of the capacity is being utilized.]</p>
<p>It can be seen that the Textile Building's production capacity is currently only operating at half capacity and is on a single-shift system. Therefore, there is still much room for promotion in the future. If a portion of it can be leased to private manufacturers to allow official-private cooperation to alleviate the clothing problem, it would be more appropriate. Second, we should</p>
<p>Adjust the Supply of Raw Materials: It is very distressing that there is a shortage of national cotton and we rely on American cotton. And America is going to reduce supply due to decreased cotton production this year, which should inspire our people to understand the situation. Under today's circumstances, the products must be designed to be civilian so that the limited raw materials can be used as much as possible for daily necessities, which is in line with economic principles. Therefore, the production of fine-count yarn and high-end cloth may be reduced. The national cotton can be used more. About 2 million bales of American cotton have been ordered and have not yet arrived, and some have arrived but have not been used. I have calculated with colleagues that, based on the current opening rate, private and state-owned industries can support the market for about three months. Private enterprises have about 2 million yarns, but only half of them are open. Unfortunately, cotton-producing areas such as North China and the Salt Reclamation Area cannot connect with production capacity due to order and traffic relations. Private manufacturers should find ways to purchase in the producing areas, so hundreds of thousands can be collected. During this period, when it is still far from the new flower being in the market, we must pay attention to adjusting the supply of national cotton raw materials. The last is that we should</p>
<p>Adjust Labor Relations: If the measures taken by both parties are disciplined, it will greatly increase the promotion of production capacity. Currently, private manufacturers and yarn mills claim to have high profits, but they are not as good as before. The environment for cloth mills and dyeing and weaving mills is even worse. Unless labor and management understand each other, the future will be disastrous. Also, in order to restore vitality,</p>
<p>Re-issuing Confiscated Yarn and Cloth: should no longer be delayed. Yarn and cloth mills are very eager for this problem. About 2 million pieces were transferred from the puppet Business Association to our government. If it can be returned immediately, it can directly save the fate of the victimized factories and directly suppress the yarn and cloth market.</p>
<h3 id="e81">Unrestricted Speculative Funds Cause Heavy Industry Fluctuations Over the Past Week - Finance and Goods See the Most Drastic Changes - Rice Prices Are High, Creating a Stalemate <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>The fluctuations of financial and goods were drastic last week. Since speculative funds have not yet been directed towards normal channels, gold, securities, banknotes still have abnormal trends. However, the Bank of China's measures to curb gold have been quite effective. The black market is in a dilemma. Although speculators are thinking of making a move, it is difficult to succeed. As for goods, the rice problem is still the most serious. Although it fell slightly for a few days at the beginning of the week, it then rose again, finally becoming a stalemate. If there is no fundamental solution, it will not be easy to break through the difficulty. Here is a summary of the developments of each industry over the past week:</p>
<p>Gold: The trend last week had the greatest fluctuations on Monday. Amid the buying pressure of speculators, it once broke through the 2 million mark. Later, because the Bank of China made open and secret sales, and credit was tight, secret interest rates were as high as two jiao outside, and people's hearts were weak, and there were frequent releases, and the market immediately declined to 1.91 million. The weakness continued on Tuesday, and then it stabilized. On Wednesday, securities and other items were bought on the cheap, and the closing price was 1.96 million yuan. On Thursday, it dropped below 1.9 million yuan. The situation changed on Friday and Saturday because the stock market attracted attention, and speculators had sales activities. In two days, it fell from about 1.9 million yuan to 1.84 million yuan, which was the closing price for the weekend.</p>
<p>Foreign Currency: The exchange rate for US telegraphic transfers this week was 2,020 yuan. The Central Bank's supply price has not changed. The US dollar fluctuates with the gold market. At the beginning of the week, it rose rapidly from 2,420 yuan to 2,520 yuan, which was the highest price of the week. From Tuesday to Friday, it hovered around 2,400 yuan. The lowest was 2,235 yuan on Saturday. The weekend closing price was 2,335 yuan, a decrease of 55 yuan from the end of last week.</p>
<p>Government Bonds: In the black market for the C bonds this week, selling pressure was heavy. 6650 dropped to near 6000, Tuesday continued decline, buying was stronger from Wednesday to Thursday. On Friday, the situation gradually revealed a glimmer of dawn, and people's hearts were prospering. The closing price on Saturday was 7,850 yuan, the highest price of the week, an increase of 1,200 yuan from the end of last week.</p>
<p>Chinese Stocks: It was still stable at the beginning of the week, but because the price of gold rose sharply, frequent sales resulted, and the market went downstream step by step. The price of each of the yarn mills and Maya fell to within 54,000, which was a drop of 400 yuan. The three small stocks fell less. On Tuesday, the market rebounded because large investors raised prices and small investors were very interested in buying. As a result, the rise of large stocks was small, and the three small stocks rose by more than 10%. On Wednesday, it was quite active at the beginning, and the yarn mills and Maya both rose to outside the 54,000 mark. Later, because floating profits were sold out, it turned into a stalemate. Near noon, they were all squeezed up. On Thursday, the yarn mills, Maya, and Xinguang all showed good results, but Jingfu was put under pressure by speculators again, and he reported that he was lagging behind with Qinxing. On Friday, except for the slight setback of Xinguang, popular stocks all had a squeezed up price, especially yarn mills. On Saturday, the yarn mills were doing well, and Maya was also raised. The three small stocks were very little bit better.</p>
<p>Foreign Stocks: On Monday, because Chinese stocks fell and selling pressure rose, everything was weak. On Tuesday, the weakness eased slightly. On Wednesday, Yisha initially opened as high as 12,500 yuan, and then entered a stalemate, finally leveling with yesterday. The small stocks continued to be popular, and Huide also rebounded. On Thursday, with the easing of credit, more parties became active. Yisha once shouted as high as 13,500 yuan, and the closing price was prosperous across the board. On Friday, Yisha once rose to 13,700 yuan, and then the floating profit was sold out. On Saturday, it rose first and then fatigued. The result was a squeeze up in all prices.</p>
<p>Rice and Grain: At the beginning of the week, the rice market was weak due to rumors that the authorities were inspecting warehouses and that the authorities were setting a deadline for registering grain in storage. On Thursday, retail sales of rice increased sharply, and sales to domestic areas were strong. The price then rebounded, and flour also prospered. The market was mediocre on Friday. On Saturday, the asking price for rice was high again, and there were few transactions. Except for the flour in the naval fleet, which fell by 2,000 yuan, the remaining flour prospered by several hundred yuan. Miscellaneous grains were stable, cooking oil was slightly weak, and sugar was strong and stable.</p>
<p>Spot Yarn: In the past week, primarily because gold and the US dollar rose in unison, the spot yarn actual sales by the Tianjin, Guangdong, and other domestic main customer groups were strong. The 42-count and 32-count double-strand fine yarn are still held by the Textile Building, so the market supply is dry, and buying is very strong. On Tuesday, the 42-count Blue Phoenix yarn once created an unprecedented high of 2.65 million. The 20-count Double Horse also reached a high price of 1.4 million. Subsequently, as the yarn of each continues to Zhang Zhi Dengfeng's pole, the factory and the many profits are abundant, and they tend to turn high and sell. On Tuesday, the price jumped by as much as 200,000 yuan in half a day. After Wednesday, it was calm. The highest of the whole week was 2.65 million for the 42-count Blue Phoenix on Wednesday, and the lowest was 860,000 for the 10-count. The difference between the high and low was 1.79 million. In terms of the number of counts, the rise of the 32-count Xiantao double-strand was still more Sheng Shi. It still rose by 200,000 from the previous week. The rise of the remaining yarns was gentle, all less than 100,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Cloth Market: Although the market was flooded with foreign goods this week, factory costs were high due to the high price of yarn, and they were unwilling to depreciate and make concessions. Moreover, the use of military uniforms, children's clothing, and umbrellas has recently been quite extensive. The weekend was the most promising. The price of each item was 2-3,000 higher than the previous week, and the price of Daming gray light diagonal cloth increased by 6,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Cotton Market: The demand from factories and cotton merchants this week was quite good. The Textile Building handled 3,000 bales. In addition, private factories such as Shenxin 167 and Jiafeng Sulun Dasheng Fu'an Xinsheng Dacheng also had considerable transactions. At the weekend, the high-grade mitering reached as high as 105,000, each up 5-6,000 from the previous week.</p>
<p>Silk: Compared with Monday, the user factory's silk and silk products were about 50,000 yuan shorter this week, and merchants from Suzhou and Hangzhou made purchases. The Ocean Bank's transaction for 78 minutes was 2.3 million yuan and 2.4 million yuan, 81 points for 2.375 million yuan, and 83 points for 2.6 million yuan. The smallest price for 120-size artificial silk Daqiao was 1.42 million yuan on Monday, the largest price was 1.5 million yuan on Friday, and the price on Saturday was 1.478 million yuan, a increase of 50,000 yuan compared with the big one on Monday. The 75th-size Yuji semi-light price was 1.54 million yuan on Monday, and the price on Saturday was 1.5 million yuan, a small amount of 40,000 yuan. The price of Zhongfang Company's goods on the fourth day of last week was 20,000 yuan higher than the sixth day of the previous week, so the market price of 120 size also increased. The market price of silk goods was weak and powerless, and the market price of lattice crepe, which is now the season's goods, was still short 245,000 yuan last week. The beauty was also short 230,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Hardware: The price of the five metals this week was low, and there were no actual sales, so the market price was weak and not strong. The same was true for small metal items. However, because the supply and demand of green yarn were not in line, the market price rose sharply to 200,000 yuan. The door lock had some sales to customers. For example, dog tag V door locks were selling for 80,000 yuan per dozen, but the factory was still finding it difficult to bear the cost.</p>

<p>[Reuters, London, 26th] It is learned here that an American cargo ship has sailed from New York to Shanghai, carrying a batch of gold worth approximately $14 million.

<h3 id="e83">Inside Story of the Sou-Mac Scheme: Soviet Union Eagerly Seeks US Dollars <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 26th] A Chicago Tribune reporter claims that usually reliable sources have revealed that the Soviet Union has supplied France with 500,000 tons of wheat, receiving in return a huge sum of US$33,000,000. The details of the Soviet-French wheat deal are being kept strictly secret, because the Soviet Union's shipment of wheat to France is intended as a political maneuver to win favor. France currently needs US dollars for reconstruction. Announcing the details would arouse public resentment. French President Gouin and Finance Minister Philip are of course aware of the details, but out of concern, they are also keeping silent.</p>
<p>The Soviet Union is extremely eager for US dollars, for the following three reasons: (1) The US dollar is a powerful tool in international power politics. (2) The Soviet Union also needs to purchase American machinery with US dollars to carry out domestic reconstruction. (3) Controlling the foreign exchange of neighboring countries, such as Poland and the Balkan states, can make it easier for these countries to submit. Therefore, the Soviet Union has been able to control the use of loans granted by the US Export-Import Bank to countries within the red sphere.</p>
<p>The United Nations General Assembly previously pointed out that the Soviet Union refused to cooperate in famine relief, and the ultimate goal was to use its surplus grain as an economic weapon to easily obtain the British pounds and US dollars of smaller countries. The Soviet Union's obstruction of the rapid establishment of peace treaties will cause the private enterprises of small countries to be on the verge of bankruptcy, or fall into the hands of the government.</p>

<p>This year’s spring cocoon loans for the three provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui were processed by the management committee of a banking syndicate, which began approving and releasing them last month. Currently, there are 57 silk cocoon manufacturers applying for loans. Last week, loan agreements were signed with 50 companies, and 7 billion yuan has already been loaned out.

<p>[Reuters, Paris, 26th] The news of the Franco-American loan has caused the value of the US dollar in the black market to gradually decline, shrinking by an average of one French franc per hour. Those holding US dollars are rushing to the black market on the streets of Paris, hoping to sell them off before the weekend. In the past twelve hours, the value of the US dollar has dropped by twenty French francs. The British pound is also weakening along with it. Black market traders near the Opera Garnier have found that no one is interested in their US dollars. A black market trader said, "Last week, we could earn seven to ten French francs for every dollar we traded, but now we only earn five French francs. If this continues, we may have to change careers."</p>

<h3 id="e90">Twenty-Nine Days in Changchun (9) <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent for This Newspaper, Shao Shenzhi</p>
<p>Two Instances of "Freedom"</p>
<p>One person suggested going out, and everyone readily agreed. No one wanted to give up this right, except for the sensible Wheeler. He preferred to stay at home, saying, "I'll watch the house and deal with any unexpected events." We agreed with his alertness and promised to return within half an hour.</p>
<p>We walked along Chaoyang Road, heading towards the Xiehe Guild Hall, which had once been used as the headquarters by the Soviet army, and then towards Datong Square. As we approached the barbed wire fence at the square's entrance, we saw hundreds and thousands of poorly dressed civilians pouring out from a building behind the Police Headquarters, as if being driven out for their lives. The surge was fierce, like a tidal wave. We had to carefully protect our fleeting "freedom," so we stood our ground, not daring to go against the tide.</p>
<p>The tide of people grew stronger and stronger. We couldn't allow ourselves to be swallowed up by the tide in vain, so we retreated to our residence. We closed the door tightly, sat inside, and quietly listened to our own breathing.</p>
<p>After a while, Wang Sanye came upstairs. Wang Sanye was the respected chef of Commander Wu Ziyu. Without saying a word, he first held out his left hand, making a "V" shape with two fingers, waving it continuously in front of us, and said in a low voice, "They've retreated, the New First Army has entered!" He said it very proudly, as if to say that we reporters, the "know-it-alls," didn't have news as quickly as he did. We didn't reply to him, and he solemnly tried to gain our trust, saying, "I, Wang San, have my ways of gathering information in Changchun." (Note: "Running errands" means "detective" in the northern dialect.)</p>
<p>Before Section Chief Bai Juren arrived, "soldiers" came to our door again to protect our "safety." This time there were sixteen of them, plus a political instructor.</p>
<p>We really didn't understand what game was being played this morning. We thought that maybe it was a troop relocation. Sanye himself knew that he had blundered when he bragged about the big cannon firing. When serving lunch, he lowered his head to an extreme degree, not even looking us in the eye. We couldn't help but find it funny. When the second course was served, Sanye hid in the kitchen and disappeared.</p>
<p>This was our first "freedom," a "freedom" we had stolen for ourselves.</p>
<p>After this, we appealed to Zhou Baozhong for democracy. After sending out the protest letter on the 21st, we constantly yearned for the grand order of "granting freedom." But the days spent cooped up in the house were longer than those spent outside. This prolonged sorrowful confinement was truly unbearable. We waited until the evening of the 21st without any response, and again on the 22nd. The entire day of the 23rd was spent languishing in the fiery hell of disappointment!</p>
<p>On the 24th, we no longer had any hope of freedom of movement. The kitchen of Lü's mansion sent us a note from Zhao Junmai, which read, "This morning, the Communist army searched my residence thoroughly, stripping everyone of their clothes. I fear it will be inconvenient for me to visit you in the future. Please take good care of the five American reporters. They are friends of China, and Changchun today is still ultimately Chinese land. Yours truly, Mai." We knew that he was no longer free either. Just when we had given up on the hope of freedom, a friend surnamed Chen suddenly arrived, seemingly a political worker. He brought four comrades, all carrying long guns.</p>
<p>He said, "Today, I am ordered by Commander Zhou to accompany you gentlemen to take a stroll in the city." He also had a letter from Commander Zhou. The letter read: "To Mr. Zhao, forwarded to the American reporters: Today you may take a stroll in the city. Although the weather is very good, I do not have the time to accompany you. I ask that you follow the advice of the guards regarding security. You had originally invited me to dine with you today, but I request that the time be determined after I notify you. With best regards, Zhou Baozhong, April 24th." We all went out at that time. Wheeler was lying in bed due to illness. This was our second instance of freedom of movement, granted to us by Zhou Baozhong.</p>
<p>We still took Chaoyang Road, passing Datong Square, then entering the city market via Datong Street. As we walked down the street, there were two soldiers in front and two soldiers behind us. The Japanese, swaggering and carefree, saw several Americans mixed with a few Chinese being escorted down the street by the Communist army. They were surprised, perhaps thinking, "Who are these bad guys?" or "What on earth is going on?"</p>
<p>Beckett was the first to feel a little embarrassed. He whispered to Shixun, "This really feels like being prisoners, it's terrible!"</p>
<p>We wandered aimlessly through the open-air market. After a while, Mattison from the Associated Press disappeared. Mr. Chen was extremely anxious and sent people everywhere to look for him. We were so disturbed by him that we simply retreated back to our makeshift prison, where we felt more comfortable. We all walked back to our residence together.</p>
<p>A while later, Mattison was found. He was running far behind us, followed by a soldier.</p>
<p>Soon after we were sitting in the lounge, Mattison and Mr. Chen suddenly started arguing. We knew that some trouble must have broken out again. Sure enough, Mr. Chen was holding two cameras, one Wheeler's "Leica" and the other Mattison's "Zeiss Ikon."</p>
<p>"I only took a picture of the fire behind the Xiehe Guild Hall, and I even got permission from that soldier," Mattison said, wiping the sweat from his forehead. We certainly knew about the fire at the Xiehe Guild Hall, but we had become accustomed to the flames of civil war in the past few days.</p>
<p>"These two cameras must be sent to Commander Zhou for verification, and perhaps they will be returned to you afterward, but one cannot say for sure." Mr. Chen meant "investigation," but he said "verification." After saying this, he took the cameras and left, without even writing a receipt, almost driving Mattison crazy.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, Mattison drafted a letter to Zhou Baozhong in the name of himself and Wheeler. The translation is as follows: "General Zhou Baozhong:</p>
<p>This morning, Mattison and several other reporters went out for a stroll under the protection of people you sent. Mattison brought his own "Zeiss Ikon," and Wheeler of the Chicago Daily News, who is sick in bed, also handed his "Leica" to Mattison, hoping he would take a photo for him.</p>
<p>Mattison only took a picture of the fire at the Xiehe Guild Hall, which he had already obtained permission from the guard to do. He took no other photos. Mr. Chen insisted on taking both cameras back this morning, saying he would hand them over to you. He did not give us a receipt when he took them.</p>
<p>Cameras are the tools of our trade as reporters. We hope you will return them to us. You are welcome to inspect the film. We thank you for your cooperation. We wish you good health! Wheeler and Mattison, April 24th."</p>
<p>On the morning of the 25th, there was still no response, and Mattison and Wheeler both believed that the cameras had been confiscated. After a while, Zhao Junmai came to see us with Peng Jiaren, Zhou Baozhong's secretary-general. At that time, we learned that Zhao Junmai, Lai Bingquan, Zhang Datong, Captain Cao, and Wu Shiyi had been moved to the Asia Hotel on Datong Street near the railway station after being searched yesterday. Zhao said, "The food is very good, even better than yours, and we are being treated very well." We were finally relieved.</p>
<p>Wheeler's first concern upon seeing Peng Jiaren was to get back his camera. He said, "Cameras and typewriters are the only tools of our profession. One cannot be without the other. I hope you can find a way to return them to us."</p>
<p>Peng Jiaren agreed to try, but did not confirm that they would be returned.</p>
<p>That same afternoon, Zhou Baozhong sent another letter, which read:</p>
<p>"To Mr. Zhao Shixun (Note: Zhou always mistakenly wrote "Xun" instead of "Xun" in his letters to Shixun), forwarded to the reporter gentlemen. I personally support your going out for interviews and sightseeing, and our superiors have also instructed us to provide you gentlemen with as much convenience as possible. In recent days, although the order and security of Changchun have improved daily, the secret agent elements secretly undermining actions have been discovered several times. Baozhong is truly responsible for the safety of your actions, so I dare not be negligent in providing guards. Please understand. If you gentlemen wish to go out today, I have already informed the guards to accompany you. However, please do not take any more photos, as Changchun is still under martial law. Furthermore, I plan to visit you gentlemen this evening for advice. Please let me know a suitable time. Wishing you good health, Zhou Baozhong, April 25th."</p>
<p>Wheeler and Mattison still hadn't heard any news about the return of their cameras. Dispirited, they collapsed onto their beds, their faces turning purple with anger.</p>
<p>When we invited Zhou Baozhong to dinner that evening, he promised to send them back the next day, saying that the film was completely untouched. Wheeler and Mattison were naturally happy, but they still hadn't been sent the next day. We deeply felt that they often did not keep their word, perhaps because they regarded us as "prisoners" and did not respect us. On the morning of the 29th, when Major Rick, the military attaché, was preparing to return to Shenyang, Zhou Baozhong came to our residence to pick him up and see him off at the airport. At that time, we mentioned the matter of the cameras to Zhou Baozhong again, and he said he would return them before you left.</p>
<p>This was the only unfortunate event in our second instance of "freedom."</p>
<p>Secret Radio Station</p>
<p>Our life in confinement within the Special Commissioner's Office was just as Beckett, a reporter for the United Press, described in a Central News Agency telegram from Beiping on the 10th: it was divided into three stages. In the first stage, we were regarded as spies; in the second stage, we were seen as political prisoners; and in the third stage, that is, after May 1st, when the Northeast Bureau moved from Jilin to Changchun, and the Propaganda Minister of the Bureau, Kai Feng, had spoken with us (Kai was formerly the editor of the Liberation Daily), the style changed drastically, and we were treated as honored guests.</p>
<p>This section about the "secret radio station" happened during the first stage when we were regarded as spies. We were constantly interrogated by the political instructors of the Communist army, once or twice, and we were truly exhausted from dealing with it!</p>
<p>It was around 5:00 p.m. on the 20th when several American colleagues were playing ball in the garden. Shixun had just woken up from his afternoon nap and was walking out of his room, wanting to join in their game. Unexpectedly, at that moment, a Communist soldier suddenly arrived. His first words were, "Who is Mr. Zhao Shixun?" He was looking at the list of reporters we had written for Sun Zheng, the political commissar of the brigade, on the evening of the 18th.</p>
<p>Shixun unhesitatingly said, "I am. May I ask your name and what you would like to discuss?"</p>
<p>"My name is Chen Han, and I'm here to talk to you," Chen said, walking towards the study opposite Shixun's bedroom. Shixun followed Chen into the study, and Shenzhi also ran in to help answer questions.</p>
<p>Chen Han was very young, probably around twenty-seven or twenty-eight years old. He said that he had studied at Nankai Middle School in Tianjin and later studied civil engineering at Shandong University in Qingdao, so he said that he also understood English. He told us that when he was at Shandong University, he had studied English with Professor Hong Shen. However, he then turned the topic to Shixun, saying, "Mr. Zhao, you are quite chubby, a bit like Hong Shen." I asked him, "Really? Hong Shen is my friend, but I don't think so myself." Chen Han didn't say anything, his eyes staring straight at the ceiling, blowing smoke rings randomly from his mouth. We all sat quietly to one side, not moving at all. He had come to have a lighthearted chat with me while we were living a life akin to being in prison. It was too disharmonious and very unsettling. The room was extremely quiet, and no one could think of anything to say. We also randomly blew smoke, and this stalemate lasted for three minutes.</p>
<p>Suddenly, he asked us seriously, "Do you have a radio station here?" We were stunned at that moment, not knowing what he was asking about.</p>
<p>"What radio station?" Guanzhi asked him.</p>
<p>"The radio station you use to send news. Actually, it doesn't matter if you do or not, we're just talking," Chen Han said, relaxing again.</p>
<p>"We don't have a radio station, and we haven't sent any news. You can search right now if you don't believe us," Shixun said to him very frankly.</p>
<p>At that time, Chen Han became cunning. He said that he had already obtained our telegram drafts. He said that we had sent news that was unfavorable to the Soviet Union and unfavorable to the Chinese Communist Party. He even said that if we didn't believe him, he could show us the telegram drafts immediately.</p>
<p>Our blood was boiling. We reported based on facts and spoke with conscience. We had never done anything to deceive our readers. But at that time, there was no time to argue with him about this point. Shixun resolutely replied to him:</p>
<p>"Then please show us the telegram drafts. We think that they are not as you describe them." At that time, his tone softened again, and he said that he was just asking and that it was not a big deal at all.</p>
<p>He walked out of the room and asked where we lived. We pointed to the small room opposite the study. Without our permission, he arrogantly forced the door open and inspected it. We really didn't know what his intention was.</p>
<p>It was time for us to eat dinner. Wheeler and the others walked into the room and asked what Mr. Chen was doing there. Mr. Chen didn't understand and needed someone to translate for him. He then said, "It's nothing, I just came to see how you are living."</p>
<p>Wheeler said, "Good, then I can tell you that our life is that of prisoners." After saying this, he ran away.</p>
<p>Chen Han became very angry and warned us, "This kind of attitude will be disadvantageous to this gentleman in the future. What is his name?" He took out the list to look. The expression on his face was terribly fierce.</p>
<p>We ate our dinner and invited him to have a simple meal, but he said he had already eaten. He still sat down to talk to us, pointing at Beckett with his chopsticks and asking, "Is this gentleman an American soldier?" Beckett put down his chopsticks, turned his shoulder, and showed him the "War Correspondent" insignia.</p>
<p>The second person to investigate the secret radio station was Bai Juren, the liaison section chief from Liu Qiren's office. He came to see us on the morning of the 21st. At that time, he claimed to be a small clerk, and we honestly believed what he said. But that afternoon, when Shixun accompanied Major Rick, the military attaché, to see Zhou Baozhong to negotiate about airplanes and gasoline, Zhou Baozhong immediately called him "Section Chief Bai." I really don't know what the purpose of this Mr. Bai's lie was.</p>
<p>The center of his conversation with us was still inseparable from the secret radio station, and we answered him in the same way we had answered Chen Han. He also asked if the Americans had a radio station, and we also said no. We also asked Bai Juren to search in the same way we had asked Chen Han, and Bai Juren also said that it wasn't necessary.</p>
<p>When he walked out of the room, he constantly paid attention to the crisscrossing wires in the yard, seemingly trying to distinguish which wire was used for the "secret" radio station. He firmly did not believe our explanation, and said, "It is impossible that you don't have a radio station. One..."</p>
<p>We ourselves also began to feel a little strange. We discussed the origin of this secret radio station, and it was really a bit of a mystery.</p>
<p>Our American colleagues all liked to write their manuscripts late at night using typewriters. With five typewriters operating at the same time, the sound would naturally arouse the vigilance of our "protectors." Listening to the sound from afar, it really did sound a bit like wireless telegraphy.</p>
<p>We began to laugh, the more we thought about it, the more we laughed, and the more we felt that the problem was becoming complex.</p>
<p>Sure enough, on the afternoon of the 27th, a political instructor surnamed Ma from the battalion came. He spoke more deeply and also mentioned the secret radio station. He began very directly by saying that there was the sound of telegraphing in our house at night. We understood that this must have been the trouble caused by the typewriters. Shixun then went upstairs and took down the typewriter, personally demonstrating it for him to see. He still didn't understand, and he had never seen a typewriter before. After talking for a long time, he left in a state of half-belief and half-doubt.</p>
<p>After walking out of the room, he also inspected the wires in the yard as usual.</p>
<p>This vague "secret radio station" had been investigated three times, which clearly showed that it was under orders from superiors.</p>
<p>A scene from Shirley Temple's new film "Kiss and Tell." This film is Temple's first new film after the victory and will soon be released in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Three Communist Soldiers</p>
<p>Our life was really extremely boring. Lippmann found a violin and a small accordion from somewhere. No one could play the accordion, but Lippmann played the violin quite well. After eating, everyone would sit together and drink tea, and he would hold his violin and ask, "What do you want to hear?"</p>
<p>Shenzhi found a phonograph, but it was broken. After using all his ingenuity to repair it, he played it every day, always the same few records, until everyone was sick of it.</p>
<p>Because Wheeler was feeling unwell, he asked for a doctor to come. This matter was also discussed and approved in advance with the protectors at the door, so a Chinese doctor was invited. Then, several Swiss people came. They wore the Swiss flag with a red and white cross, and the protectors thought they were like the Red Cross, simply taking them for nurses and doctors, and letting them in. They were two brothers and three sisters, who had previously made a living in a circus. Last year, they came to Changchun via Argentina and Moscow to perform, and now they were having a hard time making a living. The youngest of the girls, named Ingeborg, had been gang-raped after August 15th. When she told this story, her face turned green and her lips trembled. As soon as they saw the American flag, they came to visit. As soon as they came, they wanted to chat, talk about everything, dance, and drink tea, taking up a lot of time, and then they would rudely stay for dinner. The dinner itself wasn't much, but the head cook only bought a fixed amount of vegetables every day, and it was difficult for the head cook to manage. Buying vegetables required going to a very faraway place, and it was difficult to replenish them at short notice. They often arrived at the time of dinner, and we naturally invited them to sit down together. Later, we found it difficult to deal with, and once we had to take turns closing the door and eating. We were a group, and while we welcomed them, we didn't want them to come and disrupt our lives.</p>
<p>The head cook often said, "Things are expensive and difficult to buy." Only then did we realize the weight of these words.</p>
<p>The Communist soldiers at the door realized that something was wrong during their second visit. These Swiss friends would play in the house for an entire day. On the 27th, they came, and they left, saying that they were seeing a doctor for a whole day. We told him that they were Swiss people, not doctors. This made him stunned, but he said, "Swiss people are even worse, we can't be responsible."</p>
<p>"Are we not allowed to see guests?"</p>
<p>"We are ordered not to allow anyone to enter the house."</p>
<p>They left. But they came again the next day, bringing a phonograph, which caused more trouble. We negotiated with the protectors. Since they were not allowed to enter the house, then since they had come, they would have to spend some time in the garden. Lippmann drafted a letter, signed by the American and Chinese reporters, and sent it to Liu Qiren, informing him of what had happened here, asking him if it was for our "safety" that we couldn't go out, and even our guests were not allowed to come? We asked him to allow us to have normal social interactions. We asked him to reply. The letter was given to the protectors, but it was returned with the original letter, saying that they couldn't find him.</p>
<p>At this time, the phonograph that the Swiss had brought was turned on in the garden, and they were dancing on the balcony. Since they had gained a foothold, they adopted a policy of taking an inch after getting a foot. We still invited them into the house, and the protectors still muttered, saying that they couldn't be responsible, but it seemed that it could be handled flexibly. So we agreed that they could go back earlier, so as not to make these soldiers feel embarrassed.</p>
<p>These Swiss people continued to come, and every time they came, we had to negotiate with the guns at the door once. This time, they dragged a small cart of props, and we explained that they were here to perform magic tricks, and we would invite the Eighth Route Army to come and watch later. This time, they performed two programs, one was a duet dance, and the other was a technical performance. It was like the footwork in a Chinese circus. The two girls pointed their feet to the sky, each rotating a cardboard cylinder, and then they switched to two Chinese umbrellas. The technique was very ordinary, but it won praise, because we really had nothing else to watch.</p>
<p>On the 30th, it rained, and two Communist soldiers "borrowed" our phonograph, promising to return it in the evening. But it was not returned in the evening. (Later, after Zhou Baozhong's secretary investigated, it was only returned on the 5th). At noon, the Swiss friends came again. This time, the whole family of eight came together, including the five siblings, their parents, and a child. But we didn't have enough food today. We only made a pot of soup for them to eat.</p>
<p>While we were sitting and chatting in the reception room, three Communist soldiers suddenly came in from the rain, straight into our house, wanting to borrow the Swiss friends' phonograph. Shenzhi told them that someone had already come to borrow it.</p>
<p>"Those were other people, we don't know about them. Who are you?"</p>
<p>We told them that we were reporters.</p>
<p>"That won't do. We are serving the people. You must lend it to us even if you don't want to." Then, seeing that we had the intention of refusing, they pointed their fingers and glared, scolding us in an extremely vulgar and barbaric manner that we had never seen before. These people were not the ones guarding the door. In comparison, the guards were really too polite.</p>
<p>Then they started to handle guns, and the other two went to the back to move wooden boards. At this time, Beckett put the phonograph in the reception room and pulled the door shut. This fat man stood at the door, blocking the way, and said:</p>
<p>"This phonograph belongs to our guests. We cannot lend it out. We can lend our own. Besides, you have already borrowed it."</p>
<h3 id="e91">A Journey to Jiangdu <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>— Shi Yiming</p>
<p>The situation in Northern Jiangsu appears relaxed on the surface, but is tense underneath. It is said that Yangzhou has already been surrounded by the troops of Commander Yun, and without permission, ships are not allowed to dock and people are not allowed to enter the city. On the north bank of the Yangtze River, this last remaining famous city, should it undergo any changes, then Northern Jiangsu will form another new landscape. How can the thousands of people displaced and living in exile not suddenly feel worried?</p>
<p>Last month, I, as a reporter, took a trip to Yangzhou, spending five days in total for the round trip. Although it was just a fleeting glance, what I heard and saw was deeply impactful. Now, as the nation's attention is focused on this perilous corner of the ancient canal of grain transport, I wish to write this article for those who are concerned, as a reference.</p>
<p>Yangzhou fell into enemy hands in the winter of the 26th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1937]. In the past eight years, the area that has suffered the most and been the most cruelly abused has been the rural areas, especially the northwest. This is still the case even after the victory. According to my investigation, the situation unfolded as follows:</p>
<p>After the fall of Yangzhou, a portion of the Nationalist army retreated to the Huangjue Bridge and Gongdao Bridge area in the northwest countryside. The army's supplies and provisions were all taken from the villagers. Residents of the urban area, fearing slaughter by the enemy, all fled with their elders and children to the rural areas. Unable to vent their desires, the enemy had traitors like Wu Xiaohou and Fang Xiaoting flatter them, saying, "All the beauties of Jiangdu are in the countryside." Consequently, these two traitors, Wu and Fang, led the Japanese troops of Taniguchi to frequently descend upon the countryside to rape and pillage, which further incited the villagers' resistance. They rose up in large numbers and spontaneously formed groups such as the "Jiangdu County Anti-Japanese Detachment," "People's Bandit Suppression Corps," "Traitor Elimination Group," "Special Operations Team," and "Guerrilla Force." Among these, planned actions included sending people into the city to assassinate the traitor Wu Xiaohou and ambushing the enemy soldiers at Longweitian. Unfortunately, Wu was not killed in the assassination attempt. Enraged, he incited Taniguchi to launch a large-scale "mopping-up operation" in the countryside, resulting in countless deaths.</p>
<p>In the spring of the 27th year, Chen Wen gathered thousands of scattered soldiers and organized another Anti-Japanese Detachment. At the same time, he joined forces with other levels of anti-Japanese troops to discuss attacking the city. However, the plan was leaked to the enemy, and the rural area suffered a second "great mopping-up operation."</p>
<p>At that time, the people suffered under the burden of heavy taxes and levies, including so-called field taxes, anti-Japanese taxes, aircraft donations, gentry donations, and all sorts of exorbitant levies. Moreover, some bandits and military forces, under the guise of anti-Japanese resistance, extorted and plundered from the wealthy, forcibly extracting money and inflicting cruel punishments. Unfortunately, in the autumn of that year, the Beihu Lake suffered a flood, and crops in the fields near the lake were completely destroyed. The mountain fields were destroyed by windstorms, resulting in no harvest at all.</p>
<p>In the spring of the 28th year, the various levels of anti-Japanese troops and Chen Wen's detachment were all defeated by the enemy. Only the local people's Anti-Japanese Brigade remained. Later, a man named Lu Qingyuan emerged to merge them, forming the Jiangdu County Regular Force to confront the enemy. In the autumn of that year, the lake water had not receded, and the mountain fields were barren for miles. However, various taxes were still forcibly imposed on the impoverished people.</p>
<p>In the 29th year, Zhang Deyun from Tongzhou, under the guise of anti-Japanese resistance, imposed exorbitant taxes and levies in villages such as Xuxiang, Huaisi, and Huaizi. He was driven out of Jiangdu County by the Regular Force. In the autumn of that year, the lake water receded late, and the farmland near the lake only yielded half a harvest, while the mountain fields suffered from drought and yielded nothing.</p>
<p>In the 30th year, the Regular Force was scattered by Xie Kuaizi's attack. Zhang Jichuan, the magistrate of Jiangdu County, led his subordinates to flee to the northwest countryside. The local elders generously provided assistance, and young people eagerly joined. Under the strict search of the puppet county government, the puppet army, and the Japanese constabulary, Magistrate Zhang and his staff were able to continue their work safely, thanks to the protection of the people of the northern countryside. Especially in the spring of the following year, when the New Fourth Army also infiltrated the area, the support of the local people became even more difficult.</p>
<p>In the 32nd year, the traitor Wang Laohu also led a large force to occupy the area around Situ Temple, Huaizi Bridge, Gongdao Bridge, and Huangjue Bridge. He kidnapped wealthy households one by one to extort ransoms, and branded honest and upright people with the title of New Fourth Army members. If his demands were not met, he would behead them and display their heads in public. As a result, the New Fourth Army took the opportunity to provide relief to the people. Wang Laohu fought against the New Fourth Army once, but only destroyed the vitality of the local area, and finally fled in defeat. At this time, the New Fourth Army implemented the following three policies: First, destroy temples. All temples and monasteries in the northwest countryside, regardless of their age, were burned down to prevent any future military forces from occupying them.</p>
<p>Second, overthrow capital. All property of wealthy local households was divided into small portions and distributed to the poor. However, during the division process, heavy taxes and levies were imposed by the so-called "Farmers' Resistance Association."</p>
<p>Third, implement purges. All Kuomintang members, young people who participated in the resistance, and gentry who supported the government were either killed or arrested.</p>
<p>Under these circumstances, farmers in the rural areas fled to the city in large numbers. The pain of families broken, people dead, and displacement was truly indescribable. On one hand, they had to support the resistance and supply the needs of the county government operating underground. On the other hand, they could not return home and could not cultivate their fields. On one hand, they were under the oppressive power of the enemy and the puppets. Such triple suffering persisted until victory.</p>
<p>With the arrival of victory, the farmers originally hoped to return to their villages. What was recovered were only five or six townships, most were occupied. Many are unable to return home and are day and night. Some evil gentry are in control of the relief society, resulting in displaced people not being able to reasonably obtain relief, and complaints are everywhere.</p>
<p>"Three points military affairs, seven points politics" – this wise slogan of the highest authorities was not only a standard during the War of Resistance but has even greater importance after victory. After Jiangdu suffered from the ravages of war and the abuse of the Communist Party, the local authorities' various measures at this time should be especially cautious, seeking reasonableness and fairness. Otherwise, after the people have harbored grievances, it is easy for them to take risks. Taking the example of the councilors designated by Jiangdu County this time, there is truly no way to remain silent.</p>
<p>Among the councilors designated by Jiangdu County this time, Gao Yisun, for example, once served as a councilor in the puppet Third Division. Tian Yueqiu used to be a doctor in a Japanese hospital, colluding with the enemy and puppets in the past, exploiting the people. Gao Yu was formerly a propagandist for the puppet Nanjing Youth Corps (alias Gao Sanli). Speaker Zhu Ganchen opened the Fucheng Grain Shop outside Bianyi Gate during the puppet organization period, using manager Zhan Hegao to serve as the chairman of the Rice Industry Association, manipulating the county's food supply to aid the enemy, oppressing fellow businesses to donate, and hosting joint ventures to ingratiate himself with the enemy. Deputy Speaker Yu Peiren, during the enemy-puppet period (years 28 and 29), was in Shangxinzhen, Zhenjiang Third District, under the alias Ding Jian, serving as the director of slaughter tax and business tax, and also concurrently running the Xinzhen Daily, spreading poison and advocating for the enemy and puppets. All of the above is well known to the people of Jiangdu. How can the people bear to have these people chosen as their representatives?</p>
<p>Do not lose the people's hearts. We deeply hope that the authorities can pay attention to all political measures in this important town in northern Jiangsu. Written in Shanghai on May 25th.</p>

<h3 id="e92">British and American Experts Test the Power of the Atomic Bomb in Germany, Absolute Secrecy Maintained, Viewing Strictly Prohibited <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>— Special Translation by This Newspaper</p>
<p>Assuming an atomic war is to occur in the near future – say, next year or the year after – you can safely hide underground, or even in bomb-proof reinforced concrete structures like the submarine pens built by the Germans in Bremen, without any danger whatsoever.</p>
<p>Assuming the atomic war occurs later. Then, no matter whether you hide in the air, on the ground, or underground, you cannot avoid danger. In other words, if the secret obtained by British and American experts by testing bombing power on a large steel-reinforced concrete structure built by the German Labor Youth Corps is discovered by other countries, then the danger of atomic war will be difficult to avoid. Everyone should know that current atomic bombs cannot completely cope with offensive warfare, as the imagination caused by the aftermath of the bombing of Hiroshima. For example, according to experts presiding over the Bremen test, no bomb can blast through Germany's submarine pens, which are currently the most indestructible structures in the world. It cannot damage the underground factory in Moosbierbaum near Munich, and deeper tunnels or underground passages are of course even safer.</p>
<p>If the German Labor Youth Corps had known earlier and built defensive projects like those built in Moosbierbaum and other places in time, then German industry would not have been damaged by air raids, and perhaps the war would still be continuing.</p>
<p>Eliminating the Final Obstacle to Bomb Resistance</p>
<p>Penetrating Deeply into Bombing Targets</p>
<p>Currently, there is no way to make an atomic bomb penetrate metal or reinforced concrete before it explodes, or to drill underground and cause an artificial earthquake in basements or tunnels. If a war breaks out, the enemy will definitely hide under massive metal or rock defenses to avoid danger. Therefore, British and American experts are now studying how to strike the enemy's methods.</p>
<p>Indeed, they must eliminate the final obstacle resisting bombs. They are conducting this work in Bremen, guarded by troops of the British Royal Air Force throughout the entire area, prohibiting outsiders from viewing and maintaining absolute secrecy. The latest British and American bombers are throwing various bombs – including eleven-ton British-style large bombs and four thousand five hundred-pound American "Disney" rocket bombs – towards a structure one-quarter mile long and one hundred yards wide. These "Disney" bombs are relatively new, resembling torpedoes and equipped with rocket engines instead of propellers. When the bomb is close to the ground, the rocket fires, using acceleration to make the bomb penetrate deep into the bombing target.</p>
<p>Using "Penetration Bombs," Underground Pits Lose Safety</p>
<p>British and American experts will have been working on this research for a year by August of this year. This work may have already been completed, and they may already have a way to make any ground building completely lose its defensive function in wartime, and to make bombs penetrate deep underground. For example, the tunnels that greatly helped London during the war will become the targets of "penetration bombs" in the future. At the same time, when they know how to load atomic bombs into "penetration bombs," even the deepest underground pits will not be safe. (United Press Agency, London, 23rd)</p>

<h3 id="e94">Unequal Treatment of Public School Teachers <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>Editor: Prices are soaring, and many feel that their salaries are not enough to make ends meet. Public school teachers, despite their hard work, cannot even compare to vendors and peddlers. As a result, the demand for salary adjustments has arisen like a storm. Schools have suspended their teaching, and courts have postponed trials. The whole country is in turmoil, and everyone's stomachs are empty. The gentlemen of the Legislative Yuan have proposed a bill to adjust salaries and sent it to the Executive Yuan for implementation. While this proposal is still under deliberation, I would like to provide information on the current treatment of public school teachers for discussion, which may also be what the world wants to hear!</p>
<p>The War of Resistance lasted eight years, and victory has only been achieved recently. Life has been difficult for a long time. In reality, there are not many honest civil servants who starve to death. In fact, what public school teachers rely on to support themselves, in addition to their deserved salaries, often includes other income: (1) Part-time jobs. In our country, those who do more work are often paid less, and those who do less work are paid more. Middle and upper-level personnel often have time to take on part-time jobs and receive multiple salaries. However, one person's energy is limited, and no matter how capable they are, running around in multiple places prevents them from focusing their energy. For example, if a person holds three positions, it still takes three people to accomplish one thing. The country spends the same amount of money but still does the same amount of work. Money is not saved, and more work is not done. There is no economic benefit for either the individual or the country. Moreover, lower-level staff are busy and cannot take on part-time jobs, which is extremely unfair. (2) Nominal positions. Higher-level staff whose salaries are insufficient often have their wives or children hold nominal positions in other organizations to supplement their income. This is like having redundant staff who receive pay for doing nothing, which is common in official circles. (3) Salary increases. When salaries are insufficient, personal salary grades are increased. Laborers are promoted to trainees, and trainees are promoted to staff. Everyone is demanding increases from above and below, so that the salaries of university janitors are almost the same as those of university presidents, and the salaries of the Minister of Economic Affairs are not much different from those of state-owned factory workers. We certainly do not want to see the remnants of the class system again, and we certainly do not want honest officials who bear heavy responsibilities for the country to be constantly distracted by hunger and cold. (4) Special allowances. Some organizations with revenue invent various excuses to provide special allowances to staff, such as travel expenses, meal allowances, advances, or prepayment of several months' salary. (5) Ghost employees. Inflating the number of employees and dividing up the salaries of ghost employees is most commonly heard in the military. The recent incident at a police station in a certain place is still fresh in our minds. There are too many acts that violate national law. I dare not imagine them here and do not want to say more.</p>
<p>From what has been seen above, the current treatment of public school teachers is not only unreasonably low, but the methods are also uneconomical and unfair. As a member of the public school teaching staff, based on what I have seen and heard, I believe that under the flag of the Blue Sky and White Sun, the majority of public school teachers or military police can maintain their integrity and diligently serve the public. In order to prevent demoralization and people from going astray in the future, in addition to the "amount" of treatment, which the authorities will naturally plan comprehensively and which I cannot presume to advise on at this time, I would like to propose a few points regarding the "methods" of adjusting treatment and urge the authorities to pay attention. These have significant implications for the national budget, administrative efficiency, public morale, and even ideological beliefs: (1) There should be no additional pay for holding multiple positions; (2) redundant staff and cumbersome organizations should be eliminated; (3) all organizations should be ordered to re-fairly review and approve staff quotas; (4) special allowances and disguised salary increases should be eliminated; (5) those who abuse public office for private gain should be severely punished. The War of Resistance has been won, and although all citizens cannot afford to indulge in enjoyment, how can the government bear to have people serve the public with empty stomachs! If the aforementioned methods can be implemented effectively, with this support, then even if the amount of treatment is reasonably adjusted, it may not necessarily lead to a malignant increase in national treasury expenditures. This not only conforms to economic principles but also prevents unequal distribution. I ask for the opinion of wise men on what they think is appropriate. Respectfully submitted by a member of the public school teaching staff. May 23rd.</p>

<p>To the esteemed editors: Recently, I read a letter from Mr. Shou Kang on May 8th in the "Reader Opinions" column of your esteemed newspaper on May 18th, titled "Traitors Still Seem to Be Thriving." The following is a response to the sections involving this government: (1) This county's Fifth District residents Xu Chao, Yuan Zhonghan, and others filed a complaint with the Pacification Supervision Group against Song Guoan, Xing Xiaoshan, Chen Caiqing, and others for killing and extorting under the guise of anti-Japanese resistance. The group transferred the case to this county's court for handling. At that time, because the case was already under military judicial review by the local government and this county's judicial office had not yet become independent, the county magistrate was still concurrently handling judicial functions. In order to facilitate investigation and unify authority, it was appropriate to handle the cases together. Unexpectedly, Gao Yiming, the judicial review officer of this county, did not obtain the approval of his superior and rashly issued a summons that did not conform to the prescribed format. The county magistrate's authority was not to be ignored. He sent a secretary to inquire at around 5:00 PM on April 10th. At that time, the case had just been questioned and Gao Yiming announced the end of the interrogation. Therefore, he stopped it. The review officer has now been dismissed by the High Court, and the defendants in the case, Chen Caiqing, Huang Cailin, and others, have been arrested during the inspection of the Fifth District by County Magistrate Wang. After questioning them in person, he took them to the county for interrogation, and the case is proceeding according to law. (2) According to legal regulations, traitor cases fall under the jurisdiction of the High Court as the first instance, and the county government has no right to hear them and can only assist in the investigation. The traitor crime investigation committees in various counties are also investigative bodies and cannot take direct action. In recent months, this government has been ordered to investigate more than a dozen traitor cases, including Zhu Youcai, Zhu Youde, Zhou Sheng, Lu Jie, Wu Shiyi, Huang Jiaben, etc., some of which have been sent to the High Court for legal proceedings, and others are in progress. I have always admired your newspaper's strict stance and am writing this letter to you specifically in the hope that you will publish this letter to set the record straight and to strengthen our friendship. Respectfully, Chuansha County Government. (May 18, 35th year)</p>

<p>Dear Reporter: In the Reader Opinions column of your newspaper on May 20th, an article titled "The Dark and Bleak District Chief" was published, the content of which does not correspond to the facts. After Zhu Jiajiao was liberated, three district chiefs came here. None of them had done these facts. The cleaning company with relative influence, its income is being used for local purposes. There is a committee to handle things but it used to be contracted out to private entities and now it is all public. Other things like rice shops closing down, protecting gambling, and smoking opium are all lacking any foundation in reality. Hope that you will publish this letter for the sake of justice and to avoid confusion. Wishing you peace!

<h3 id="e96">Congratulating the Establishment of the Shanghai Branch of the National Federation of Industries <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>— Yi</p>
<p>The Shanghai branch of the National Federation of Industries of China has recently announced its establishment after several months of preparation. The declaration listed the following six goals for future work:</p>
<p>(1) To promote the enactment of the Industrial Association Law.</p>
<p>(2) To complete the construction of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Industrial Plan.</p>
<p>(3) To implement the national industrialization goal.</p>
<p>(4) To intensify industrial economic research.</p>
<p>(5) To properly arrange postwar industrial facilities.</p>
<p>(6) To pay attention to the contribution of amending commercial treaties.</p>
<p>The progress is divided into four points: organizational work, reporting work, academic research work, and investigative work.</p>
<p>Indeed, during the War of Resistance, many factories moved west with the Nationalist army, making indelible contributions to the war effort. After the victory, most factories encountered unexpected difficulties, and people generally had a precarious sense of panic about the future of Chinese industry. If China's economy is to seek recovery in the future, then the prerequisite is to revitalize Chinese industry, solve current difficulties, and plan future development.</p>
<p>To achieve this goal, individual strength alone cannot accomplish it. It is necessary to apply the power of the masses. Therefore, the most important thing in fact is the organizational aspect of the work, as the association said in its statement on the prospects for future work: "The strength of a group depends entirely on the soundness of the group's organization," and "Members of all industries should unite, be consistent in their dealings with the outside world, eliminate past destructive divisive work such as jealousy, provocation, misunderstanding, or alienation among the same industry, and should help each other, be harmonious, and unite with the spirit of living and dying together."</p>
<p>Now that the Shanghai branch has been announced and the directors and supervisors have been elected and taken office, it is hoped that the association will be able to follow the established guidelines and earnestly work to save the endangered Chinese industry and lay the foundation for future development.</p>
<h3 id="e97">A Visit to the Li Xing Great Wall Brand Vacuum Flask Factory and an Interview on the Recovery Situation <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>— Ba Ling</p>
<p>The vacuum flask is a necessity of daily life. In recent years, whether in remote rural areas or in small and large households, everyone has to have one or two vacuum flasks for washing and drinking. The reporter, wanting to understand the manufacturing process of vacuum flasks and the current situation of the industry, specifically visited the Li Xing "Great Wall Brand" Vacuum Flask Factory, famous in society for its "crystal glass liner flasks," which is something that those concerned about industry and commerce would be happy to hear!</p>
<p>Thanks to the reception by Mr. Gan Dounan, the manager of the factory, the reporter was able to tour the entire factory. Mr. Gan said: Li Xing Factory was founded in the 18th year of the Republic of China (1929). At that time, he realized that the vacuum flask was not only a daily household item, but also a boon for travelers. However, for many years it had been imported from abroad, resulting in profit outflow, which was truly distressing. At the same time, because Japanese vacuum flasks were flooding the market, Mr. Gan, in order to promote domestic goods and compete with Japanese goods, decided to raise funds to establish the "Li Xing" Vacuum Flask Factory on Qimei Road in Zhabei, and used "Great Wall Brand" as the trademark, with the meaning of "strengthening national defense." After the establishment of Li Xing Factory, it immediately began manufacturing various types of vacuum flasks to meet market demand. Because of the excellent quality of its products, business flourished. Later, a distribution office was established in Deming Lane on Jixiang Street as a hub for business dealings. Since the advent of the "Great Wall Brand" Vacuum Flask Factory, due to its superior quality and durability, the people of the country have been happy to purchase it, reclaiming a considerable amount of profit rights. This achievement is truly indelible.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the "August 13th" Anti-Japanese War broke out, and the enemy invaded Shanghai. The factory site happened to be in the line of fire. Mr. Gan's crystallization of more than ten years of hard work was completely sacrificed in the enemy's artillery fire. The extent of the loss was truly inestimable. However, Mr. Gan did not become passive, but instead became even more active. In the spring of the 27th year of the Republic of China (1938), under Mr. Gan's leadership, Li Xing Factory built more than a hundred factory buildings at the intersection of Gordon Road and Lipu Road, employing more than 300 workers, resuming work, and actively producing. It also reorganized the internal structure, implemented strict management, built worker dormitories, and arranged special hospital appointments to protect worker health. It established training classes to cultivate technical talents. During leisure time, it provided considerable education to enable workers to increase their knowledge and settle down to work happily, achieving the effect of labor-management cooperation. Based on years of experience, it invented the "crystal glass liner flask," setting a new record in the vacuum flask industry. The reporter believes that this spirit is worthy of emulation.</p>
<p>As for the manufacturing process of vacuum flasks, after the reporter's visit and Mr. Gan's instructions, it is known that there are three steps:</p>
<p>(A) Flask Liner Section - First, melt the glass and make two types of flask blanks, inner and outer. Cut off the bottom of the outer flask and the neck of the inner flask. Combine the two flasks, pull the bottom of the outer flask, cut the neck of the flask neatly, and then close the flask opening to form a flask liner. Then silver-plate and evacuate the air. The flask liner is then fully completed.</p>
<p>(B) Shell Manufacturing Section - Use copper sheets and shears to cut pieces that meet the standard dimensions, use a punching machine to punch out flask lids and flask shoulders, then electroplate the flask lids and flask shoulders. Then cut galvanized iron sheets into suitable pieces and use rolling machines to make shells. After adding paint, the shell manufacturing process is fully completed.</p>
<p>After the flask liner and shell are manufactured, the flask liner is matched with the shell to become a complete vacuum flask. If the flask liner is matched with an iron shell, it is an iron-shell vacuum flask; conversely, if the flask liner is matched with a bamboo shell, it is the currently popular bamboo-shell vacuum flask.</p>
<p>After the visit, Mr. Gan was asked about the current recovery situation of the industry. Mr. Gan believes that the reason why vacuum flasks have not fully recovered after victory is due to the unresolved nature of the following difficult problems.</p>
<p>(1) Soaring Raw Material Prices: The price of raw materials used in vacuum flasks, such as iron sheets, has increased five to six thousand times compared to pre-war levels, and the price of coal has increased fifteen thousand times. The prices of all other raw materials have increased several thousand times or more compared to pre-war levels. Whether it is possible to suit the purchasing power of the general public with such high costs is a question. Therefore, most factories are temporarily taking a wait-and-see attitude and dare not rashly resume full production.</p>
<p>(2) Lack of Working Capital: The losses suffered by vacuum flask manufacturers during the Anti-Japanese War were extremely severe. To resume production now, it is impossible to operate without substantial capital. Therefore, it is hoped that the financial sector, especially national banks, will provide the industrial sector with large amounts of low-interest loans to help them resume work.</p>
<p>(3) Transportation Difficulties: Although the war has ended, transportation in various places has not yet fully recovered. The sales of vacuum flasks in major commercial ports, especially in Southeast Asia, are the largest. Since transportation has not fully recovered, the industry itself does not dare to fully resume work, so as to avoid the impact of frozen funds.</p>
<p>(4) Surging Labor Unrest: Due to the rising cost of living in the city, labor unrest has erupted in various industries, causing endless frustration for the industrial sector. Vacuum flask manufacturers, in view of the severity of labor unrest, dare not recruit large numbers of workers, resulting in various disputes caused by labor unrest.</p>
<h3 id="e98">Labor-Management Cooperation Increases Production <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>— Meng Jiang</p>
<p>Recent disputes between labor and management have left mediators helpless. The pathological state of labor-management disputes in these short months is no longer about raising wages and increasing prices, or increasing prices and raising wages, resulting in the inability of the capital side to bear the expenses, and the inability to raise prices. If a fundamental solution is not sought in the future, then the remaining industries and commerce after this disaster, on the one hand, will face difficulties in sales due to increased costs, and on the other hand, will be subject to the dumping of low-priced goods from abroad, which may lead to an incurable illness.</p>
<p>As a result of soaring prices, purchasing power has been drastically reduced, and the sales of manufacturers have also become sluggish. Therefore, the current production volume is reduced, which is also one of the reasons due to the decline in purchasing power. At the same time, on the other hand, precisely because the production volume is reduced, there is a shortage of products. This is why, although purchasing power is extremely low today, prices are not generally declining. From the observation of the past few months, it can be seen that the current situation is no longer a cycle of rising prices and increasing wages, but a cycle of production volume and purchasing power. To address the current urgent needs and seek solutions, there is only</p>
<p>1. Increase production.</p>
<p>2. Increasing production must be based on sincere and close cooperation between labor and management.</p>
<p>We should be deeply convinced that after the production volume increases, prices will inevitably fall. Once prices fall, purchasing power can gradually increase. Once purchasing power gradually increases, the sales volume of industries and commerce will inevitably become active, and after the sales volume increases, more workers will inevitably be hired, reducing unemployment. The result will inevitably be a further decline in prices, which will result in a further increase in purchasing power. If we broaden our horizons and think big, in ten or twenty years, China can be like the United States today, making the people of the whole country better consumers, and able to consume better goods.</p>
<p>Therefore, today's workers must avoid thinking that increasing wages can solve the problem of life, and forget their own productivity. If this root concept is not changed one day, it is tantamount to suicide. The reason why American workers can occupy an advantage in the world market is that their production capacity far exceeds that of other workers. And what is pitiful is that the productivity of Chinese people is far lower than that of Americans, but today they exceed the wages that American workers can obtain; I would like to ask how the Chinese people will resist the goods manufactured in extremely specialized countries. Under the principle of mutual assistance, the capital side must not only seek personal wealth, while making laborers rich, and its own forgetful industries and commerce will never have a day of peace.</p>
<p>The authorities' cost-of-living adjustment index has been discussed by various parties. If the adjustment index is not appropriate, how will the principle of cooperative assistance be established? The author believes that in the future, workers' wages should be based on workers' productivity, in addition to the minimum prescribed amount. If a worker's production capacity is high, the rewards for encouragement will also be high. Workers who receive this encouragement will be devoted to work, and their skills will become more refined due to the higher rewards. However, the capital side must be able to reduce costs due to the increased general productivity of workers, and sales can be slightly loosened due to reduced costs. Is this not a win-win situation for both sides, which invisibly increases production and promotes lower prices? In addition, we certainly cannot deny that reasonable allocation and transportation of supplies, transportation issues, and political issues are all closely related and urgently need to be resolved. In short, for the sake of national construction, everyone should sacrifice some interests for the welfare of the masses, so that the entire country and society can be revitalized.</p>
<h3 id="e99">General Situation of the Tobacco Industry <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>— Jun Yi</p>
<p>After the outbreak of the Pacific War, due to the inability to import foreign tobacco, China's tobacco once had the opportunity to rise. Before the war, the annual amount of imports consumed reached more than 500 million yuan. After the enemy seized the British American Tobacco Company, the raw materials were exhausted in less than a year, and they had to use Chinese tobacco. A Central China Tobacco Stock Company was specially set up to distribute production areas, and tobacco was included in the controlled goods list. Without the company's permit, outsiders could not collect and transport it. The cigarette factories established by them, due to the proper roasting by technical personnel, the products were not inferior to the past, so it can be seen that as long as artificial improvements are made, domestic tobacco may not be able to compete with imported products. After the victory, American cigarettes have flooded the market again. If this continues, domestic cigarette factories will inevitably be greatly affected. Fortunately, at the time of writing this article, it was reported that the United States has accepted the Chinese government's proposal to ban tobacco imports, which is indeed good news for cigarette merchants. However, tobacco is not only produced by the United States. Before the war, countries such as Turkey and India also imported into the Chinese market. Moreover, American-made cigarettes are not included in the ban, so there are still many dangers in the future, which still need to be carefully studied and improved by those who operate this industry.</p>
<p>China's tobacco is most abundant in Anhui and Gansu provinces. However, the latter is mostly used for local tobacco. Anhui Province has both southern and northern parts. The tobacco produced in southern Anhui is generally called local tobacco, centered on Tongcheng, which is adjacent to Anqing. Taking that place as an example, the annual output has reached 30,000 dans. Other places such as Datong, Chaoxian, Wuwei, Hexian, Luzhou, and Zhutoushan also have production, but the quality is slightly inferior. The tobacco produced in northern Anhui is mostly flue-cured tobacco, with Fengyang, Yinyang, Bengbu, and Linhuai Pass. The quantity is approximately equal to the local tobacco in southern Anhui. It is not easy for non-experts to distinguish the two, only the color is slightly more yellow than flue-cured tobacco. There are also other types such as tobacco shreds and tobacco stems, which are the tips and stems of China, and the texture is also harder.</p>
<p>At present, the reasons why the tobacco industry is difficult to develop are that the taxes and duties are too heavy. From the production area to the consumers, there are nearly ten types of taxes and duties. Another reason is the lack of transportation and difficulties in transportation. Taking Tongcheng to Shanghai as an example, it must go through several transfers of boats and vehicles in Datong, Tuqiao, Wuhu, and Nanjing. Most of them are waterways, and old-fashioned wooden barges are used for towing, which costs a lot of time and manpower. Moreover, whenever it rains or snows, the tobacco will become waste once it gets damp, resulting in greater losses. At present, the freight exceeds more than twice the price of tobacco in the production area. No wonder foreign tobacco, although it travels across the ocean, can still compete with domestic tobacco in the Chinese market. As for the planting of tobacco, it has still adhered to the old methods for nearly a hundred years, which is also worrying and should be paid attention to.</p>
<h3 id="e100">General Discussion on Industrial and Commercial Management <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>— Xu Baiyi</p>
<p>The Importance of Psychology in Industry and Commerce</p>
<p>We have already discussed some of the most important principles of management in the previous section, and now we can talk about the importance of psychology.</p>
<p>We should think carefully about what is the biggest factor in creating a manager? Some people say that it is due to physical strength, for example, someone has a strong body, so he can take on all the important tasks of a manager, but in fact, physical strength is important, but it is not the most important point. For example, Napoleon, Carnegie, and they all had extraordinary abilities, but they were not strong people. Some people say that it is due to good congenital heredity, but many successful managers or successful entrepreneurs, their ancestors were not people of status. Some people say that it is due to a convenience at the beginning. This point is not entirely true in fact. For example, Charles Schwab, the steel king of the United States, was a worker in a steel factory. Rockefeller, one of the richest men in the world, was a bookkeeper in a very small manager's office. Many entrepreneurs who currently occupy a high position have risen from extremely humble positions.</p>
<p>So what is the main condition for the success of a manager in the end? It is to have a management ability. This ability is mostly mental, so to become a successful manager, the first thing is to create a sound mind.</p>
<p>We can give an example to illustrate how a manager can use his mind to make his business run smoothly or achieve the purpose of success. In the past, there was a large magazine publishing company in the United States. They were famous for their thoughtful service and prompt delivery. But once a section of the railway was about to be temporarily stopped, so the circulation director of the magazine company immediately tried to find another route to ensure that there was no loss in terms of time. Therefore, a manager must use his mind at all times to adapt to the environment and solve various difficult problems.</p>
<p>In today's world, where the trend is constantly evolving and the handling of affairs is becoming more and more complicated, it is especially necessary to develop a sound mind in order to cope and develop.</p>
<p>In the future, we will discuss the business aspect, with the mind as the center of discussion.</p>
<p>Two Kinds of Mind</p>
<p>In business, there are two different kinds of minds, one that is obedient to others, and the other that is empowered to others. A manager often belongs to the latter.</p>
<p>So how should one reach the point of being empowered to others? Then you must have the following conditions:</p>
<p>1. Creative Spirit No matter what kind of business, if it does not progress, it will regress. Therefore, a manager must have a creative spirit, especially when new problems arise, he must use his best efforts to solve them. Otherwise, if he blindly sticks to the old ways, the business will not progress, and the problems will not be solved.</p>
<p>The generation of the creative spirit is based on an automatic habit, so first you must develop an automatic habit, and put in the effort to research everything. Then you can solve various problems easily.</p>
<p>Because of having an automatic habit, you can have a lot of valuable experience from the daily handling of various problems. This experience can become a basis for "knowing why." Now the industrial circles in the United States attach great importance to the so-called "Know How" because being able to "know why" in everything can avoid various wrong opinions and wrong decisions.</p>
<p>2. Responsibility This point can be said to be connected with the automatic habit and the creative spirit. To become a successful manager, being responsible is very important. Based on the point of being willing to take responsibility, he can study the problem carefully and must seek a reasonable solution. A manager who can manage others must be able to take responsibility and bear all the consequences.</p>
