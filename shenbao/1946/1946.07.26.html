<h3>揚泰公路交通恢復　國軍越海安前進　徐州外圍收復靈壁蕭縣</h3>
<p>〔本報鎭江五日電〕據泰縣急電，我國軍已於廿四日進入海安，（泰縣東一百廿華里），廿五日正向富安挺進。溱潼國軍，亦沿水路向時堰推進，以期會師東台，惟國軍越海安前進，如入無人之境，東台縣城，指日可下。又西綫共軍團攻六合受挫後，紛紛向天長逃竄，我國軍乘勝分路追擊勢如破竹，先頭部隊已退近蔣　高家堰，（距淮陰三十餘英里）淮陰城內共軍，準備撤退。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿五日電〕共軍二萬餘人，分乘五百隻民船，由汽艇拖曳，自淮陰循運河南下，於昨日經寳應向高郵急進中，準備增援進攻揚州六合一帶。又自天長盱咍增援進攻六合之共軍二萬餘人，截至目前止，尚未出現第一線。</p>
<p>〔本報鎭江廿五日電〕據軍方發言人談，揚州外圍，仍在共軍包圍中，我國軍自始至終，仍採取自衛守勢，以待天長泰興兩方面之進展，但天長方面國軍，已推進至四郊，　因共軍之主力牽制，尚未能進展。</p>
<p>〔本報鎭江廿五日電〕蘇北局勢，大見明朗化，據揚州急電，揚泰公路共軍，今晨已被國軍完全肅淸，破壊之廣福橋，經國軍配合沿途民衆搶修，業已完成，現揚泰間電訊交通，恢復正常狀能。又今日下午二時，仙女鎭西南上空，發現不明國籍飛機兩架，幷向地下田機槍掃射，擊斃農民八人，傷人不詳。又悉天長共軍一股，昨夜十二時竄至仁和鎮大載集，企圖不明。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿五日電〕徐州以南共軍據點靈璧縣城，已於昨晚爲國軍收復，又天長日內即可收復。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿五日電〕確息，由宿平山　寗永城三面進迫企圖威脅州之共軍各綫攻勢，均被堵截，逐漸不支，截止目前爲止，徐州外圍，固若金湯。</p>
<p>〔本報　江廿五日電〕軍息，徐州國軍被迫迎　後，已將徐州外圍共軍面面擊破，共軍化整為零，向山僻小路竄奔，徐州國軍，沿　海綫安穩　進，已一鼓收復新安鎮，而西面部隊，已將蕭縣收復。</p>
<p>〔本報頭江廿五日電〕軍息，蘇北皖北魯南一帶共軍，日前向徐州進迫、徐州外圍各據點守軍，即分頭予以迎擊，茲悉雙方經數日來之激烈戰鬥，西路由蕭縣進犯之共軍，及東路由新安鎭進犯之共軍，均被國軍奮勇擊退。</p>
<h3>調處中原戰事無結果　小組昨返抵西安　房縣共軍紛向竹山竄逸</h3>
<p>〔本報漢口廿五日電〕軍息，（甲）共軍李光念之主力，現尚竄踞漫川關（陝鄂邊界）東北之馮家店附近，不斷發動攻勢，企圖侵犯國軍防區，對和平使者之調處，迄無接受表示。（乙）廿二日有共軍殘部三四千人，西竄竹山縣，且有北犯陝邊白河縣，與李先念合流之模樣。（丙）竄擾房縣之共軍，於廿一日後已完全被自衛隊驅逐，紛向竹山方而逸去，地方秩序，已恢復，逃難民衆紛紛歸家復業，惟被共軍拉走之壯丁甚多，現哭聲載道，正由政府辦理善後中。</p>
<p>〔本報北平廿五日電〕某軍事要人稱：「中原軍區」之共軍六萬人，經現仍進行中之大戰後，仍集結一處，而堪可作戰者，僅餘五六千人，餘者殆皆潰散。</p>
<p>〔中央社西安廿五日電〕卅二小組一行，今午後三時廿分乘汽車抵此，該組在能駒寨時曾約請共軍李先念會商，但未取得聯絡，致該組調處工作，暫吿停頓。</p>
<p>〔中央社漢口二十五日電〕自十四日以來，駐節老河口進行調處工作之第九小組，會先後四次以飛機投擲函件，邀請李先念派遣代表至老河口·淅川·及龍駒寨協商，迄未獲答覆，半月來之和平努力，毫無結果，由第九小組派來漢口聯絡之共方代表薛子正，政府代表王振旅，今晨飛往老河口，會同政府組長盧濟時將軍，美方組長何柱堅上校，常日飛往西安，三十二小組亦同時由龍駒寨起程赴西安，即行飛赴北平·向軍調部請示。</p>
<h3>漢行營參謀長　駁斥共黨聲明</h3>
<p>〔本報淡口廿五日電〕武漢行營參謀處長鄧定遠氏，頃對共產黨駐漢代表鄭紹文，於本月十一日在京發表之歪曲聲明，分別據實駁斥如下：（甲）郵紹文所謂「三一〇」南軍區，自五月中旬以來，即在國軍大軍進攻下，經月餘激戰，大部被國軍佔領云云，實則六月二十五日以前，鄂豫方面，根本無戰事，其無中生有，不　　笑。（乙）渠謂：一此次大戰，是以攻佔宜化店，殲滅共軍主力爲目的」·試問共產黨中原軍區，實力如何，共產軍盤踞地區，是否天險，誠如共方所傳，國軍包圍共軍，並對共軍作有計劃之攻擊，則結果勢將予以重大打擊，亦不難將其擊潰，何至任其越路西竄，到處作亂？（丙）渠又謂：「東路潑皮河虎灑于二十七日相繼爲國軍之七十二軍及四十七軍所攻陷」云云，更屬無稽，今就我前綫部隊拾獲共軍第一縱隊第二旅第六團命令兩件，證明該縱隊係於二十一日十九時開始行動，且該第六團原駐在潑皮河以東光山以南之何畈附近，是共軍自二十一日奉令開始行動，已可證明自二十一日至二十七日相距六天之久，國軍與共軍離開六天以後，始應人民請求，開久潑皮河，尤可見其顚倒事實，不攻自破。鄧氏言時，出示共軍命令兩伴，經記者詳閱後，益徵共產軍之宣傳，確屬無稽。</p>
<h3>胡天八月即飛雪　東北將士籌寒衣</h3>
<p>〔本報北平廿五日電〕「胡天八月即飛雪」。東北數十萬將士之冬服，亟須及早製備，爲此，後勤部副總司令陳良，已于前日飛瀋籌備一切·</p>

<h3>共軍擄泰縣推事　地院請設法營救</h3>
<p>〔本報蘇州廿五日電〕共軍攻陷泰縣，將地方法院案卷全部焚燬，擅釋在押人犯，且擄去推事陳傳元，會計孫義昭二員，迄今生死不明，現經該院呈報蘇高院請示，已轉報司法行政部，設法營救。</p>

<p>〔本報南京廿五日電〕恢復交通協議實施以前，本報記者今訪交長俞大維，俞氏稱：本人接任迄今未及二月，對於交通各項問題，正在分別研究，並聽取各單位之報吿中，且目前欲談交通問題，其重要者當仍在政治·軍事兩問題之獲得解決，亦即在國共商談能獲有定局，本部除竭全力於恢復已被破壊之工作而外，不欲擬訂任何新的計劃。因目前交通之整頓與改進，眞是千頭萬緒，無論在鐵路或公路以及航空或水運，均待整理。又據稱：目前全國鐵路急須修復者，共計有六百公里，共軍施虐，被其破壊鋼軌，每將一段截成數段，使之無法復用，而美國援華之各種物資中，交通工具與器材又僅佔極少數量，且常因配件不全，無法即刻配合使用，乃爲目前最大困難工作，至感痛苦。又悉：鐵路方面破壊最甚者，爲隴海路東段七十餘公里全部破壊，所有枕木，器材，蕩然無存，粤漢路前雖勉强通車，但各種設備皆缺，維持不易。記者就此一席談話中獲悉，交通之恢復，百分之百實寄托於政治問題之解決。</p>
<p>〔聯合社北平廿五日電〕此間交通當局今日宣布，東北鐵路在政府軍控制區域內者，已有北寗，吉長，瀋長等五綫恢復行駛客車。</p>
<h3>傘兵總隊官兵在漢候輪來滬</h3>
<p>〔本報漢口廿五日電〕傘兵總隊司令馬師恭氏，自湘抵漢。據談：該隊共有官兵六千餘人，此次經湘來漢者約四千人，現正候輪赴京轉滬，並　在京滬一帶勘定訓練班地址·</p>

<p>據悉：政府方面對此項要求尚在考慮中。聞民盟方面如派人赴昆明調査李聞案件，其人選可能爲梁漱溟。</p>
<p>〔本市訊〕中美合作所副主任貝樂利上校，對於周恩來之談話發表聲明如下：最近上海報截周恩來將軍之談話謂：中美合作所曾以無聲手槍移交中國政府之秘密警察云云，査該項談話實毫無事實根據，在三年來，本人担任中美合作所參謀長，美國駐華海軍組組長，及中美合作所副主任期內，從未經手領得該種武器，自無從以之移交中國政府之任何部門。又詳査中美合作所所獲美方物資之全部淸册，亦無任何無聲武器由美國駐華海軍組經手移交，中美合作所之各種武器，均屬一般正常渚，其用途完全限於打擊日軍。過去中美合作所之戰績，即充分證明，該項武器在上述運用範圍內，確曾發揮最大之效用也·</p>
<h3>聯大追悼聞一多</h3>
<p>〔中央社昆明廿四日電〕聯大聞一多敎授喪葬　卹委會廿四日下午三時在聯大曾北映室舉行聞一多敎授追悼會，由梅常委貽琦主祭，雷海宗敎授報吿聞氏生平事略，黃鈺生院長及馬喈致哀辭，末由聞氏女公子致謝。</p>

<p>〔本報　　廿五日電〕關於前曾傅主席有返京一行之消息，據本報記者探悉，主席於短期內不致返京。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿五日電〕據悉，國共商談之地點，移往廬山之可能性甚少，因共產黨堅持決不願登山，同時，參加商談之政府代表，亦均未離京，頃以周恩來返京，記者曾訪政府某代表，據稱：三人會議可能即日召開。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿五日電〕周恩來·鄧穎超廿五日下午五時飛抵京，周氏原定今晚往訪馬帥，惟因感於陶　知之新喪，情緒甚爲沮喪，故改訂廿六日上午十時興馬帥會晤，對國共商談之諸問題，交換意見。周氏在滬商洽「解放區」救濟及黃河堵口兩事，業已獲有成果，並有協議，其內容不日即可發表。</p>

<h3>關於糖價問題　政院公布真相</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京廿五日電〕行政院宋院長前以社會一部份人士以台灣糖業公司成立後，對於上海糖價增漲，頗有　　，於在　招待新聞記者談話會上，允於返京後即飭各主管機關前往確切調查真相，並商擬通常處理辦法，予以公布。朱院長返京後，即令飭經濟部部長王　五，農林部部長周貽春，及資源委員會主任委員錢昌照，會同調查，商擬呈院，茲已由行政院依照會呈情形，公布如次：</p>
<p>（一）台灣糖業公司成立及歷次售糖經過</p>
<p>台灣糖業，在日本投降以前，係由日本糖，台灣，明治，　水港四公司經營，轄糖廠四十二所，蔗田二百萬畝，　路二千公里，資本額達日金三億元之鋸，實為台灣最大之工業。太平洋戰事發生後，日人以米　缺乏，台灣大部份蔗田，改植糧食，加　盟機爆炸糖廠廠房設備，損失極大，故在停戰之前，台灣產　，已跌落至年產三十萬噸。　年十月，政府人員蒞台後，即於十二月一日成立糖業監理委員會，本年四月移交糖業接管委員會，查甘蔗種植季節，在每年七八九三個月，而製糖季節，則為一月至四月，甘蔗自下種至收穫，須歷時十八月，故本年種植之甘蔗，須至後年年初，始能利用製糖。上年新投降時，蔗田種植季節已過，而彼時因日本缺　太甚，故已鐘甘蔗為數有限，本年一月至四月間，利用已有甘蔗，製成糖八萬六千噸，而明年一月至四月，因受上年種植過少影響，產量恐將銳減至三四萬噸，後年之產量，則　於今年種蔗數量。資源委員會接辦台灣糖業，則過於本年四月間奉命飭辦，當經奉准與台灣行政長官公署合辦，因有一小部份台胞投資在內，故組織台　糖業股份有限公司經營，於五月一日正式成立，即經資源委員會聘請美國專家到台，實地親察，協助公司，擬具恢復計劃，現美國專家初步報告業已寄到，估計補充修復設備，所需美金達三千萬元之鉅，分三年支用，，第一年約　　千萬元，此項恢復計劃完成以後，可年產砂糖一百萬噸，足以　應全國需要面有餘，如每噸從　以美金一百元計算，年可節省外　一億元。綜上所述，我＼台糖規模宏大，所　事業，不僅製糖，　及　路農田，且修復資金為數不貲，而將來可節省大量外　，自可由政府統　經營。（未完）</p>

<h3>教育制度亟需改革</h3>
<p>上學年度已結束，下學年度游將開始。教育事業是建國的血輪，累年轉旋，前後延續，以培育國家的新生。但是中國現行教育制度，對於國家的功過得失，究為如何，殊足檢討。</p>
<p>中國新教育的內容是德智體三育並重。就近三四十年來施行的結束，嚴格言之，實在失敗多於成就。先說體育。要使種族健康，改造體格，本來條件很多。國民的教育水準，經濟能力以及各種與民族健康有關的社會制度，如保健中作的推廣，殘廢男女結婚的限制，飲食方法及飲食原料的改良，都與一般人民健康的進步或退化，息息相關，原不能將全部責任歸諉於教育一個部門。但是就教育部門而言，三四十年來新教育對於體育的提倡，顯極狹窄。體育的表現僅止於運動會與球賽的舉行，對於一般廣義的養生攝生的體育教育，很少成績可言。至於體德，更是有名無實。品格的訓練本須通過實際生活，始能發生持久而固定的影響，現在各級學校，雖有公民修身這一類課程，但究其實際，則道德教育的本身也完全落入了書本主義的窠臼，此耳入，彼耳出，一無效果可言。所有年來政治的混亂，貪污的流行，道德的敗壞，士氣的消沉，無不足以說明過去中國新教育在德育方面的全盤失敗。過去中國新教育的唯一重心，似乎完全側重於智育一項。智育本包括着思想與知識，而思想與知識，顯非僅僅在教室的活動，固未嘗走出課室，離開書本。我們剖析中國現行的教育制度，從小學到大學，無不是考滿幾分即為及格，及格幾門功課即可升級，讀完幾年即算畢業。招考學生，均以筆試為主，因口試不及格而落第者，百不一見；聘請師資，祗問履歷，不問人品。上課下課，開學放假，這就是中國的「教育」形式，也就是中國的教育內容。今日中國整個的教育，祗是一種書本（Bookish）教育，除「書本」以外，幾乎別無他物！</p>
<p>教育最大的目的和任務，是培育人品，訓練做人。知識的傳授固然重要，道德的訓練尤其重要。品格是土地，知識是建築；土地不固，所築高樓大廈，無不是白費力氣。我們現在都有子女，我們細細研究，將一個孩子送入學校，從小學一直到大學，他究將從什麽地方得到科學的訓練？他如何能養成一個現代化的頭腦？頭腦不現代化，不科學化，他必定缺乏理性，思緒混亂，做事無條理，無效率。若再進為希望他又崇高的理想，偉大的懷抱，驚人的發明，更是緣木求魚！我們現在看各方面的領袖人物，那一個不是受過新教育的洗禮的？然而國事日非，社會日亂，此中因果，思過半矣。現在一般社會上舞弊的手段愈來愈精巧，詭辯的能力也愈來愈高明，而道德的墜落則則更愈來愈厲害。不講品性訓練而祗抱着幾册書本的教育，訓練出來的人，必然自私，詭詐，偏狹，強橫，而自私，詭詐，偏狹，強橫，都足以破壞社會的安定，阻礙國家的進步。現在中國的教育，今年照去年的樣走，明年照今年的樣走，年復一年，永遠這樣照抄下去，真可謂浪費國家的公帑，貽誤青年的光陰，糟蹋民族的種子！</p>
<p>我們曾和身負大學行政的朋友閒談，他們亦無不以今日教育制度的病態為憂，並感到無限的痛苦。然而整個教育制度的改革，旣非一二少數人的呼喊所能為力，也非偶一談及這個問題的報紙所能推動。今日身負國家教育行政責任的人，應當下大決心，先以全力來注意並研究這個問題；在教育文化界局於領導地位的先生女士們，自然也責無旁貸，應該出來討論這個問題，以為改革的張本。教育是建國的根本。我們認為今日中國的教育制度，亟須加以全盤的檢討和改革，藉以充實國家的生命，締造國家的前程，切不能在這樣年復一年地因循下去。</p>

<h3>昨試炸淺水原子彈　激起水蒸汽柱高九千呎　中心靶子艦二艘先後被擊中沉沒</h3>
<p>〔聯合社此基尼廿五日電〕今日淺水原子彈爆炸結果如下：</p>
<p>〔沉沒艦船〕戰艦亞干薩斯號，航艦沙拉比加號，帆船，坦克登陸艇，及繋原子彈之中型登陸艇各一。（傾斜水中顯巳損壞艦船）戰艦紐約號及長門號，航艦獨立號，巡艦班薩柯拉號，驅逐艦許斯號及運輸艦發龍號。（沉沒湖底損壞未明艦船）試驗時下潛之潛艇五艘。</p>
<p>〔聯合社麥金萊號旗艦廿五日電〕原子彈試驗司令白朗第今日宣稱：「潛艇六艘或八艘原停泊水面下試驗原子彈之威力，吾人不知其是否巳擊沉。並無一艘浮至水面，從空中見有兩艘仍停在水面下原位。礁湖中靶子艦附近，仍有輻射作用，故未能立即斷定軍艦所受損失至何種程度。生命方面並無死傷。」白氏旋報告原子彈所激起之水柱稱：水柱約高五千呎，瓦斯及水蒸汽柱則高達九千呎。水柱底直徑長二千一百呎，柱頂直徑尤大。激起之巨浪迅即消散，衝擊至比基尼礁湖岸時，高亦不過七呎至十呎。礁湖外所停泊之艦船未受水浪，輻射能或水面下衝激之影響。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社比基尼珊湖礁附近廿五日電〕據官方宣布：比基尼礁湖淺水原子彈爆炸結果，靶子戰艦「亞二薩斯」號沉沒，鋼骨油船及登陸艇各一艘亦同沉海底。試驗時水面下停留潛艇四艘，水面上另泊兩艘，水面之兩艇現仍飄浮。據飛機報告：潛艇一艘巳在水面下發現，停泊爆炸中心以東各艦，似未受創；礁湖水底之水草，被炸彈扯裂，水面呈深青色，當局現正設法蒐集搜集含有無綫電輻射能之海水標本。但在數日以內，尚不能接近「亞二薩斯」號沉沒地點附近。衆信該艦約在十五分鍾內沉沒，因礁湖上空之煙霧於十五分鍾內消失故也。</p>
<h3>炸後景象一霎那</h3>
<p>〔路透社舊金山廿四日電〕比基尼來電頃始開始湧入，第五枚原子彈炸後五分鍾內，海水即噴高約五千呎之高，繼又噴出蒸氣水點達四千呎之高。海水昇高處海面直徑，佔計約有二千一百卅六呎，愈高則水柱似愈細。炸後兩分鍾內，各靶子艦除在外圍之數艘外，均爲水氣所籠罩，不復可見。十分鍾後，水氣猶未消盡，惟同時則見高約五呎之海浪，打擊島之珊瑚岸，十三分鍾後靶子船巳有十六艘可以望見，半小時後巳可確定二萬九千噸主力艦尼伐號，日主力艦長鬥號，一萬一千噸巡艦獨立號仍在水面。當試驗之前，無綫電報告會謂：白朗第中將巳宣布延期半小時使原子彈爆炸，至三時半始由麥金萊號宣布原子彈巳較預定爆炸期遲五分點用無綫電鈕使其爆炸。艦上一軍官在無綫電中報告距爆炸之時間，當報告到至僅餘一秒鍾後，即聞轟然一響，同時海水即湧起成柱愈至尖端愈形細小。炸後十分鍾，白朗第中將在旗艦宣布：原子彈巳於八時卅五分比基尼時間爆炸，當云霧逐漸消失後，二萬六千一百噸之主力艦亞干薩斯號巳告失蹤，當巳沉沒。航艦沙拉葉加號尾部沒入水中，主力艦紐約號似亦受傷，比基尼島之棕樹似均不免折斷。白氏當可於爆炸後兩三小時內宣布初步結果。</p>
<p>湖面目標船　顛簸如玩具</p>
<p>〔聯合社B—29型「比基尼呼聲」號機上廿四日電〕世界第五顆原子彈在比基尼礁湖水面下爆炸，湖面戰艦顛簸如玩具，但原子爆炸之力最並未使排列靶子區域之大多數主力艦沉沒。巨彈爆炸時，礁湖攪成一片煙火。礁湖中部浪濤隨爆炸湧起，但未捲過比基尼島。海水最初卷起一巨峯，呈深褐色，直衝云霄，繼之發生水面下爆炸之第二現象。突然間，從洶湧之水面中，爆發一巨大穹窿形煙霧水結成之圓柱，柱底黑褐，攪擾而又沸騰。蒸汽之中心圈，在日光中迅即消散。一切現象均如曇花一現，轉瞬消滅。海面旋即昇起一片汽蒸，掩蔽艦隊，如白羊毛遮蓋，視綫受阻，礁湖中央呈異樣之青色，證明原子彈巳破壞湖床。自空中向艦隊一暼，證明大部份主力艦雖未沉沒，但巳被炸力擲出原來位置，艦底殆巳受創。</p>
<p>比島棕櫚樹　霎時一掃光</p>
<p>〔聯合社比基尼廿四日電〕世界第一枚潛水原子彈，今夜九時三十五分（格林威治標凖時間）在比基尼爆炸，其聲甚大，激起水柱高達一哩，惟煙霧消散時，至少有艦船十六艘仍浮水面。炸聲之大，即遠在舊金山之無綫電收聽者，亦清晰可聞。據官方觀察員稱：此項水霧與原子彈在空中爆炸所激起者逈不相同。此項浪花向上空噴射高達八千呎。比基尼蔚藍天空懸一云朶，空中觀察員之視界爲之掩蔽，此項云霧漸告消散。比基尼珊瑚礁上之棕櫚，在七月一日晨人中轟炸時，雖告無恙，今顯巳全部毀滅。科學家原預測將激起百呎巨浪，顯未實現。聯合社記者魏德海代表美國報界，乘B—29型在比基尼上空觀察，頃發電稱：「世界第五枚原子彈怪異的力的尖端，巳將比基尼礁湖灼燒成爲火燄，煙霧及蒸汽之在鑊，停泊其間之艦船命運如何，渺不可知。」水柱上升速度驚人，迨高達約一哩之上空，即散布成菌形，其頂點而形成數百萬垂冰，紛紛降落海面。</p>
<p>雄蜂式飛機　深入危險區</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社舊金山廿四日電〕廿五日晨舉行第二次原子彈試驗，將有大批飛機參加觀察爆炸後各種現象，其觀察範圍以爆炸地點爲中心，其半徑將及三十哩，如是得使飛機六十六架同時進行工作。在此假想範圍之內，將分爲四個相待區域，稱之曰「糖」，「狗」，「東方」，「勝利者」，其時飛機將自海平面高飛至一萬公呎，如此大規模利用飛機觀察科學現象，誠屬空前。照相及電影設備均有裝置，科學專家將就各種光綫，無論爲目力所及與否，用分光鏡另以分析：更有特組小隊專事觀察無綫電波之衝力。若干飛機裝置自動駕駛設備，名曰「維綠」，用以測量大氣層中之無綫電活動，另有此項「爐峰」飛機，則將飛入危險區，憑其自動壓力計，得以測量爆炸之平均力量。</p>
<h3>澳洲地震　經京大雷雨　傳與試驗有關</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕舊金山廿五日廣播：澳洲亞得雷特天文台地震計所紀錄之震波，據稱乃比基尼島原子彈爆炸之結果。據政府天文專家杜威　爾稱：該項紀錄在實施爆炸後十六分鍾進最爲顯著，相當於擾亂的感應電波。但距離比基尼島更近七百哩之雪梨地震計，並未紀錄任何震動。又訊，比京白魯塞爾發生可怕之在雷雨，若干人士認爲與比島原子彈試驗有關。</p>
<p>〔聯合社比基尼礁湖中阿派拉欽號廿五日電〕新聞記者參觀艦阿派拉欽號今日向晚駛入礁湖，距爆炸不足九小時，今夜停泊礁湖南部。</p>
<h3>威爾森出庭歷述　南京大屠殺慘狀　刀戮　槍刺　活燒　褻辱　日軍暴徒令人髮指</h3>
<p>〔聯合社東京廿五日電〕美加州亞凱第城醫師威爾森曾懸壺南京，今日在國際法庭敘述日軍於南京大屠殺時，對婦女刀戮槍刺，淩辱萬狀，更將居民活焚，又追述一九三七年十二月十三日日軍攻陷南京時，一大學醫院之中國醫生看護如何逃逸，日軍如何暴行百出，致醫院傷者滿室，日軍如何槍刺行人，如何對無辜平民唾吐摑頰，及迭次淩辱大批居民後，慘加屠殺。經六星期以上，日軍在南京對平民所施殘酷行爲，始漸減少。</p>

<p>當由辯護人布魯克斯起立質問：七七事變係由日本頒布宣戰，仰係由中國宣戰？（答）中國政府未曾頒布此種命令。（問）證人於陳述書中述稱，被告鬆井曾謂「亞洲乃亞洲人之亞洲，英美願由亞洲驅逐，」關於由亞洲驅逐英美勢力一事，請問其詳？（答）馬尼刺及珍珠港之攻擊，非由亞洲驅逐英美勢力之至佳象徵乎？問答至此，審判長認爲關於此事答辭巳畢，促辯護人迅速進行訊問，布魯克斯竟稱，「餘欲證明因西洋各國來中國擴大其商業勢力之結果，將日本逼向大戰爭。」審判長乃要求布氏提出證據。布氏向秦氏另作訊問稱，中日糾紛進行中，中國有無向國聯提訴，或向日本政府抗議？證人能否提供該抗議之資料？（答）本人並不熟悉中央之外交交涉。關於日本之侵略行爲，則曾屢次報告中央。（問）何時報告中央？秦氏甫欲陳述張弱事件報告要旨，審判長卻制止曰：「如需要報告內容，可向中國政府提出，辯護人請稍待。」辯護人乃繼續訊問，「蘆溝橋事變時，證人之地位爲何？在何處受參謀將校之　練？」此問爲審判長所制止，審判長與辯護人間忽就中日甲午戰後規復失地問題。展開辨論正午續由布氏訊問：一九三七年前，蔣主席或其他中國官員有無向日本要求財政上援助？（答）無。但曾一度爲經濟合作而接洽，然此亦係由日本方面向中國要求者。（問）經濟合作中有無包含軍用品.武器.彈藥等？（答）無。（問）一九三七年前有無外國將校入中國軍隊，與中國軍隊保質密切關係？此時檢察官表示問題並無關係。二時三十分再開，審判長宣稱，「茲報告法庭之決定，今後反對訊問應以主要事項爲限。」旋即對秦氏略作訊問後，即結束數日來辨認人對秦氏之反對訊問。繼即傳證人羅柏，威爾森到庭證明南京屠殺事件。</p>

<h3>出席糧農會議歸來　鄒秉文談旅美觀感　美年耗十億金元改良農業　我農業應用機械科學耕種</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕我農業專家鄒秉文博士（見圖），自三月七日，飛美出席聯合國糧農組織執行委員會後，業於日前乘戈登將軍號輪抵滬。昨日本報記者特趨訪問，叩以此行觀感。承吿：此次留美期間，前後約共三年。觀感所及，約可分爲三點而述：（一）美人對我國各事，頗爲關切。渠留美期間，曾在各地旅行。與美國農業界人士，接觸尤多。深感美人對華友誼之誠摯，惟最近我國紛爭消息頻傳，不免使一部份美人感到失望。故亟望此不幸之事件，能早日解決，然後可使我國在國際間之地位，得以提高。</p>
<p>農業國家竟鬧飢荒</p>
<p>（二）我國為農業國家，按理應以糧食接濟他國，而不應仰仗於他國糧食之接濟。但事實昭示，我國於戰前，每隔數年，常鬧飢荒一次，卒至救援於世界各國。此次戰後，我國飢荒之消息，又傳播全世，徒使他人感覺，我國本身對農業太不重視，以致有此結果。故深望我國今後對此過去之錯誤能有一補救辦法。（三）此次同船歸國者有我國政府派遣赴美實習之農業，工業，交通等專門人材四百六十五人。此中農業人材在美實習過程，統由本人負責主持。此次返國途中，曾在船上與各學員分組談話，深覺各員均當具能力與朝氣。故希望於返國後，政府及社會均能利用此批學員，使各員能各盡其材。</p>
<p>記者詢以返國後對中國農業建設之感想，渠稱：余在美國研究農業，深感美國政府對於農業建設，用心備至，每年美國國庫幾有十萬萬美金，用於農業經費，故農業生產之改良，農村經濟之發展，農民生活之提高，農民智識之普及，均能完成理想目標。不但如此，美國農業部且聘請大量專家，從事科學研究如DDT殺虫藥及盤尼西林之發明，均爲農部專家發明。其有益於人類之福祉，固不僅在農業一端而已。反觀我國，一切均感落後，自不可同日而語，當前先決目標首須實現下列三條件：（一）全國農業生產自給自足，（二）增加全國農民收入，（三）發展農產品以爭取外匯·</p>
<p>利用機械　加緊開墾</p>
<p>鄒氏幷說明中國因工業需要，農民减少，耕地單位面積擴大，需用合作方式逐漸達到農業機械化·同時因中國荒地甚多，尤其在東北九省，更需加緊開墾，以增加生產面積，充裕農民收入。最後，鄒氏稱：美國農業生產，現已過剩，每人可耕地由一百增加至一百二十英畝。中國農民每人可耕地則祗數畝，勞力頗多浪費，必須利用機械及科學耕種方法，始能增加生產，減少僟荒云云。</p>
<p>稍作逗留　即將赴京</p>
<p>按鄒氏現任中美農業按術合作團華團長，農林部及糧食部高等顧問，中華農學會理事長，且爲聯合國糧農組織十五位執行委員之一。該會於去年十一月在加拿大奎北克召開第一屆成立大會。鄒氏出席成立會後，曾於去年十二月十日，一度返國。旋又於本年三月七日飛美，參加該會在美召開之第二届執委會。本年六月廿八日，該會在美續開第三屆執委會，至七月三日方吿休會。鄒氏於七月十日於舊金山登輪返國。據吿：該會第四屆執委會，將於本年八月廿八日，在丹麥舉行。九月二日，在同地舉行年會。屆時鄒氏將飛丹參加。聞鄒氏在滬稍作逗留，即將於本月廿九日首途赴京。</p>
<h3>農業團體茶會　歡迎返國農業人員　農林部將統籌分配工作</h3>
<p>農林部爲適應戰後農業需要，上年四月曾選拔優秀技術人員，赴美實習。該批實習人員，包括獸醫十二人，畜收九人，漁衆五人，農業氣象二人，農業經濟十八人，農業機械七人，農田水利七人，土壤肥料十四人，食物加工二人，農業推廣二十一人，植物病蟲害十二人，農藝三七人，森林十四人，水土保持四人，合計一百六十六人。除農業經濟及農業推廣等部分實習人員四十餘人，因事延展至九月初始能返國外，其餘一百十人，已完成其一年餘之學程，於本月十六日與代表我國出席聯合國農業會議之專家鄒秉文博士，由舊金山同乘美輪「戈登將軍」號返國，於前日上午十時抵滬。昨日下午三時三十分，農林部暨上海漁市塲等機關團體，假淸華同學會舉行茶會歡迎。到周詒春鄒秉文及實習人員等一百餘人。首由周部長致歡迎詞，希望對中美農業技術合作，有所貢獻。並望能用其所學，各爲本位努力，以應建國需要。繼由中華農學會吳覺農致詞後，周部長復請鄒秉文博士致詞。末由農林部趙司長連芳報吿，該批赴美實習人員，除已有工作接洽者外，如願意由部介紹者，可先登記。部方現接江蘇農業改進委員會，廣西省政府，湖北善後救濟分署，四川省農業改進所等各機關來函，要求供應人才，如願應聘，極所歡迎。鄒秉文氏主張爲求人與事能充分配合，最好由農林部統籌分配。周部長當即面約各實習人員分批來部談話，直至六時許賓主始盡歡而散。</p>

<h3>販毒詐財案情節複雜　被告柳冠敏所供內幕　日人圖毒害美軍</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕有柳冠敏者，烟台人，住白克路二〇六弄十四號，因藏有鹽酸嗎啡四磅，意欲出售，乃於本年三月卅日赴日人前川伊一郎家，托其代兜主顧。四月二日，柳又偕同業醫生之無錫人朱國賓（住中正路一二七五弄八號）携嗎啡樣品一瓶，交前川伊一郎。前川伊一郎即於當日下午將此樣品携往另一日人半出義雄處，由半田義雄再輾轉經過日人井田登及大島政尾（女性）之手，與陳慶風（住狄思威路浙興里四十二號）接洽交易。陳係台灣人，擬購毒品販往台灣·當時即托友人柯家駿代與大島政尾接洽，大島政尾即將該樣品携至有恒路一二七號柯家，看明貨色後，由陳柯二人與大島言定價格每磅三百萬元。四月四日上午，由井田登徵得柳冠敏同意，當日下午二時許，由大島政尾赴柯家取來定洋一百四十七萬元，交給井田登。其時柳冠敏突轉念頭，以爲日僑在華根本已無勢力，意圖吞沒定洋，即與一挪威人名羅納者串通，將前川等騙至餘杭路富樂拉咖啡館一小室內，收取定洋一百四十七萬元後，羅即自稱係美軍情報員，將該日人等騙走。事後柳分得一百零七萬元，羅納得四十萬元·不意日人井田等以柳與羅納詐欺錢財，心有不甘，立即報吿憲兵獨立第三營第二連，經該憲兵隊將所有人犯一併拘獲，交地檢處提起公訴。昨晨首次公審，被吿等延律師姚君喻，單毓華·申應試等多人，皆否認有販毒行爲，惟據柳稱：本年二月，因赴朱國賓處診病，經朱吿以有日人大田（現已歸國）欲購大量嗎啡，擬假猶太人之手，帶至美艦，混入水管，以毒害美兵。柳聽之不平，乃報吿友人美軍情報員羅納，由羅納轉吿美軍當局，美軍當局乃托柳朱等與日人敷衍，以探求彼等之陰謀究竟。柳賓與美軍情報處有關，否認有詐財之意。庭上將各被吿逐一審訊後，以案情複雜，諭令分別還押，改期再訊。</p>

<h3>袁美雲　好消息　停止執行　尚未絕望</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕電影明星袁美雲因吸雅片，被地院判徒刑六月，褫奪公極一年。後袁家屬具狀聲請停止執行，經檢察處交法醫檢騐，已無毒癮，乃引用刑法第八十八條請地院刑庭免予執行，但遭沈天保推事裁定駁回。現地院檢察官傳邦爲反對駁回聲請之裁定，特於廿四日提出抗吿，並於昨日將抗吿理由書一份送地方法院轉高等法院，另一份送達被告袁美雲。</p>
<p>該項抗吿理由書稱：本件被告袁美雲，女，廿九歲，天津人，在押，因煙毒案件於本年四月十二日被上海市警察局拘解本院於五月十七日判處有期徒刑六月，限二月內交臂勒戒。嗣經本檢察官以被吿先後在本院看守所及上海監獄中已經三月餘之禁戒，並經本院法醫檢査已無烟癮烟毒，認爲無執行刑罰之必要，聲請免其刑之執行。詎本院刑事庭以卷內無禁戒處分之執行，駁回聲請。査被吿袁美雲自被上海市警察局移送本院，迄逾三月，即自判決之日起算，亦已屆滿二月。此時期中被吿在本院看守所及上海監獄內，實際上已實施禁戒，原判決上復有限二月交醫勒戒等語，核已兼備禁戒處分之形式與實質，殊非完全無禁戒處分之執行，與刑法第八十八條第三項規定，尚無不合，爰提起抗吿，請撤銷原裁定，另行裁定，此致上海高等法院。</p>

<h3>金價徵低美鈔續跌</h3>
<p>烚赤平庸無變，晨開一九五萬左右，開後高價一九五萬二，美鈔大鬆，此後曾退至一九四萬，中央配給一〇〇條，價亦退至一九四萬二五，十時後更爲平和，以迄午刻，仍在一九四萬五左右掙扎，午後仍形平和，結果較前收稍見低落，飾金徵回爲念萬零七，紋銀平而銀元略跌，暗息甚爲鬆動自一角至一角二分左右。</p>
<p>外幣美鈔旣經實貨壓低後，浮多斬售，以致自二五七〇元賣價起，一路盤低至二五二五元，而後稍穩，午刻在二五四〇元左右盤旋，午後仍平，結果較前收續跌二十元，港票初平後疲，結果較前收再跌五元，港匯五五〇元左右，印滙六六〇元至六七〇元，英滙八千八至八千九，美匯明平暗呆。</p>

<h3>華南五省災民難民　向賴伽第亞控訴</h3>
<p>— 本報十七日香港航訊　特約記者林友蘭</p>
<p>他們辛辛苦苦修復了粵漢鐵路，築成了廣九公路，滿以為將可大量獲得聯總的救濟品……但賴伽第亞的禁令，却叫他們失援！</p>
<p>香港是聯總救濟品在中國三大運輸中心之一。聯總運華的救濟品經過香港轉運的，約佔全數十分之四以上。這個比率以後還要陸續增加，因為香港的背後就是廣大的華南災區，等待急賑的飢民和難民，何祇千千萬萬。自從粤漢鐵路和廣九公路相繼修復通車後，半年來厄於運輸不靈而滯留香港對岸九龍的救濟品，現在正好沿着這條交通大動脈如潮一般衝進兩湖兩粤的災區去。可是就在這個時候，聯總署長却下令救濟品暫停運華，這對於對聯總抱着最大希望，年來風餐露宿尚幸苟延殘喘的災民，倒是一個何等的打擊！</p>
<p>拉加第亞先生下令救濟品暫停運華，最初說是救濟品被「撥作政治用途」；跟着便指「因中國無能供應物資起卸之設備與內地運輸缺乏所致，」後來又歸咎於我方散發機構的不善。除已由行總蔣署長一一加以答辯外，記者願綜合華南人士的意見，再補充幾句：（一）華南一帶，沒有政治糾紛；（二）華南交通工具日見改進；（三）運輸暢通，散發機構的弊端自可减少。由此觀之，拉加第亞先生實在沒有淸楚認識了中國的情勢，便遽作這個「不人道」的決定，至少對華南的情勢是如此。</p>
<p>災民何辜</p>
<p>誰都知道，粤漢鐵路是由聯總協助修復的。修路工人所吃的麵粉是聯總供給的，修路的材料是聯總供給的，補充的機車和貨卡也是聯總供給的……中國的工程人員總算沒有辜負了聯總的好意，在半年內把這條慘遭破壊的鐵路修復了。廣九公路也是由聯總協助修復的。華南的災民現在異口同聲的問：爲什麼拉加第亞先生要下令救濟品暫停運華？鐵路公路通車爲什麽當作「運輸缺乏」看待？是不是有了這個「運輸缺乏」的藉口，就寗願把滯留九龍的糧食（白米兩千噸）「暫借」給香港政府，而置湘桂飢民於腦後？</p>
<p>湘桂災民目前的慘痛遭遇，聯總不是不知道的。杜魯門總統的代表月前視察湘桂災區，曾公開表示，認爲需要增加救濟品預備，始克濟事，我們旣體諒聯總的處境，對指撥的救濟數字，不願强人所難，堅持要求，但拉加第亞先生斷不能反以爲可欺，甚至下令救濟品暫停運華。現在，糧食一項，雖然答應繼續輸華，但災情慘重的華南難民，除了區區不無少補的糧食外，還需其他物質上的救濟。華南一帶，尤其湘桂兩省，除了重建農村外，工業的建設，以至文化的灌輸，聯總方面亦有一個義不容辭的責任。今華南交通網已次第恢復，而聯總的供應品却讓他堆積在美國西岸，拉加第亞先生坐視千千萬萬曾爲爭取盟國共同勝利以致廬舍蕩然，身無長物的災民，飢寒交迫，岌岌不可終日，而忍心中斷他們日夕祈求的救濟品，於情於理，都說不過去。</p>
<p>請看災情</p>
<p>根據記者的調査，聯總的救濟食物，現存九龍待運者，僅餘一萬六千六百餘噸。據九龍儲運局負責方面表示，救濟品由九龍運省，每日約達一千噸，則這個數字，祇消兩三週內便可輸運完畢，其他機器，如農具，卡車，鐵路器材等，現亦加緊裝配，陸績經公路或鐵路輸入華南內地。聯總撥交的工業原料，如棉花，士敏土等，數目奇少，事實上的需要，距離尤遠。就算拉加第亞先生准許糧食與交通器材繼續輸華，但缺乏機械和工業原料，我們的工廠還沒有辦法開工，我們被敵人破壊的村鎭城市，還談不上建設，千千萬萬的男女，至多也僅過着半飽半餓的生活，沒有脫離災民的痛苦。聯總的救濟品，本來已不够應付實際上的需要，拉加第亞先生最近由美起程赴歐視察聯總的業務，我們希望他能够順道來華一行，尤其勞駕趕到災情最重的湘桂等省份視察視察，看看他的太平洋對岸的密切隣人的眞實情形，相信明斷銳利的前任紐約市長，將必懊悔他下令停運的失計！</p>
<p>「催命符」</p>
<p>華南五省千千萬萬的災民，現在盼望拉加第亞先生快快撤消禁令，積極運輸救濟品來華。他們對於聯總和拉加第亞先生還是懐着衷心的領感。要是拉加第亞先生仍然不明察眞實情形，昧於事理，一意孤行，那末，拉加第亞先生將在華南災民心目中——全中國人民的心目中——構成一個極惡劣的印象。其理由何在，請讓記者表陳出來：</p>
<p>貫通華中華南的粤漢路，旣由聯總協助以中國戰後第一條修復鐵路的重要姿態通車，要是牠所遷進華南以至中國內陸的，不是數災救難的供應品，而是一般吸取中國剩下僅有的經濟血液歐美的商貨，不是復興破碎支離農村市鎭所仰賴的救濟品，却是摧殘中國社會元氣的外來物資，不是建設奄奄一息的民族工業的機器工具，却是壓倒中國經濟再生的低廉商品，那麽，拉加第亞先生不啻送給中國災民一個最靈騐的「催命符」，加速中國災民的死亡，同時也促成中國經濟社會的總崩潰！</p>
<p>最後期望</p>
<p>記者要特別的指出：現在香港的堆棧裏已充塞各種低廉的歐美商貨和昂貴的奢侈品，準備乘粤漢路之便，雙管齊下，長車直入，傾瀉於中國腹地，以金元和英鎊的力量，作「征服」中國的新個圖。我們當然不能把這陣可能的暴潮惡浪，推諉於拉加第亞先生的一個不明智的決定。但聯總是一個「救濟」災民，協助飽受戰禍的國家辦理「善後」復興的國際機構，過去曾不斷給予我們種種物質上的協助，救濟廣大的災情，逐步復興慘遭破壊的國家。爲山九仭，功虧一簣，我們實有充分理由要求拉加第亞先生立刻撤消禁令，繼續盡可能運輸救濟品供給我們的緊迫需要——消滅災情，復興中國。</p>
<p>記者派駐華南，耳濡目染上述云云，亦僅從華南的角度去看這個全國性的問題。不容諱言，華南救濟品的散發機構，曾發生多少毛病，華南災民對此，比拉加第亞先生更感切膚之痛，現已要求行總力謀改革。拉加第亞先生本濟世心腸，應從大處着想，不能因噎廢食，捨本逐末，致引起不良後果。華南災民對於拉加第亞先生的控訴是善意的。直至現在爲止，他們似還沒有失却對聯總的期望。</p>
<p>廣西哀話</p>
<p>— 本報十日桂林航訊　特約記者梁小中寄</p>
<p>飛升的物價像一條無情的鐵鞭，把人心敲擊得又慌又亂。米！米！米！多少人夢裏也在焦灼地想着明天的米糧，多少人却在利用着地位，假借着名義，勾結了一些早就該槍斃的甚麽局甚麽公庫的米賊狼狽爲奸，拼命的收，沒命的囤，嘴吧上是一片婆心，肚皮裏却吸飽了飢民的血！</p>

<h3>挿草標賣兒鬻女</h3>
<p>桂林市參議會開會，參議員痛心疾首的質問：「究竟是否有人囤積居奇？」答覆得眞大方：「市府對此極爲注意，已派人四出調查，目下市區內尚無囤積發現。」漂亮得體，兼有優長，要有發現的話，除非要包龍圖再世。郊區裏幾十萬幾十萬斤的「官囤」啊，甚麽時候才會大發慈悲呢？</p>
<p>一方面有官挾着米險詐的笑，一方面省境却到處發現了插着草標賣兒鬻女的悲劇，成行成列的擺在街頭，一百五十斤榖子，你便會愜意地帶走一條飢餓的「靈魂」，靑黃不接，黑白未分，奈蒼天何？</p>
<h3>偷不得　肚皮難熬</h3>
<p>大股匪的報道說得太多，再談一些小賊，也許不會索然無味，救濟分看的救濟米運到桂林，飢民們跑到米船上去用手指挖開米袋，偷到三兩五兩，飽嘗了一餐老拳。救濟麵粉人倉「收儲」的時候，飢民們成羣的用竹片刮着袋外的粉屑，也給狠狠的挨了一頓，等到米入了倉，麵粉也入了倉的時候，飢民們便只好望穿秋水了。田野外種的芋頭，蕃薯，種子還沒有發芽，早就被挖個一空，有一個「雅賊」挖了一片畬地的薯種後，還在地上留下一張字條：「明知種子偷不得，可憐肚餓實難捱。」十四個字，好刺眼。</p>
<h3>三百萬候補餓莩</h3>
<p>新榖登塲，遙遙無期，田賦開徵，却如十萬星火，徵實如數，一分不减，另外還要附加公糧三成，多少災難，還要加一塊大石頭壓上去！廣西的百姓生來就是一條苦命，他們不敢怨，也不會怨，國家要他們死，他們怎會抗拒？但願政府多愛憐一分，也就忍淚無言了。</p>
<p>除了田賦公糧以外，還有一條一條的蔴繩，緊緊的纏繞着廣西人的心房。財政收支系統改訂後，廣西全省預算歲入原爲三十億元，而歲出却爲八十億元，總計不敷五十億元，這五十億元那裏來呢？自然，羊毛總是出在羊身上，三步離不了一個「稅」字，而現在差不多每一縣的稅收名目，都已多到不成樣子。田賦，公糧而外，有富力捐，軍糧，自衛隊捐，警備捐，屠宰稅，菸酒牌照稅，飲食店稅，衛生附加稅，使用牌照稅，公秤費，攤位捐，……還有不知多少的臨時派捐，眞是無物不捐，無捐不重，花樣繁多，未能盡述，再加上五十億元，全省一千四百六十餘萬便佔了三百一十五萬「候補餓殍」的飢民，要榨出腸，榨出臟了。</p>
<h3>救災捐小得可憐</h3>
<p>災荒深重，拯飢救死的工作何嘗有甚麽進展？一塲旱又一塲水，嚇得人們的心跳出了嘴唇邊。現在已經是舊暦六月天時，新榖早就應該登塲，可是田裏的禾稻現在還沒抽芽，躺在田壠邊餓死的人一天比一天多，救災沒有錢，靠募捐，省裏的人十九是等着活命的人，那裏來的錢？災民最少的縣份也有三萬人，最多的竟至百分之九十七都是災民。省裏面沒法想，就只有伸出求援的手！桂省旅外的同鄉曾經四面奔走呼籲，廣州行營曾經命令部屬節食捐助，上海報界也代捐募到了一點錢，湊來湊去，數目小得可憐，老實說，桂災不會比湘災輕，但是得救的結果，却是那末判若否壤，爲甚麼呢？求求全國的同胞，救一救廣西的命！</p>
<p>災荒聲裏，省參議會畢竟有了一塲收獲，議長的爭執解決了，內政部覆來了一個電，陳錫珖的四票「錫」字沒有理由當作廢票，結果陳錫珖穩然以四十四票當選參議會議長。李任仁失敗了。鬧到一團糟的參議會這才天晴日朗。陳就任了議長職，省政府也才肯出席作施政報吿，（議長問題未決時省當局拒絕出席作施政報吿）。大會展期，議員們又紛紛提出了救災的呼籲，提出了嚴峻的質問。彷彿許多事集合起來便是一處沒有復原的創口，每一次的安撫，都是痛，都是血，廣西人受苦的確受得够啦！</p>

<h3>如此鄉長！</h3>
<p>編輯先生：</p>
<p>我有一個親戚在戰前是一個很善良的農民，在抗戰時期，加入國民軍兵團，抵禦敵人；敝鄉淪陷後，加入游擊隊，擾亂敵人。勝利後返鄉，仍從事耕種，不料竟被鄉長某某，運用爪牙，控吿敝親爲游匪散勇之類，拘留敲詐，後被地方部隊偵悉，因査無實據，結果開釋，然敝親因此已損失米二十餘石。但該鄉長眞會利用時機，乃恐嚇該原控吿之無知鄉民，亦損失三十餘石米。鄉長恐事敗露，再度陷害敝親，不幸又被扣押起來。敢請當局主持公道，澈底調査一下，爲人民解除痛苦才好。（金山縣金衛區査山鄉一鄉民）</p>
<h3>溫州班輪之可惡</h3>
<p>編者先生：</p>
<p>從上海開往溫州之輪船，船主之喪心病狂，茶房之窮兇極惡，橫敲竹槓，肆無忌憚，乘客痛苦萬分，無處可訴！茲摘述其尤者六點於左：豈航行海上，可無法無天乎？</p>
<p>一·輪船之載重量原有限制，該船主利壑薰心，於海關人員封閉駁門後，又私開裝貨，致貨物堆疊如山，通路阻塞，甚至大小便處亦爲堆貨之地。萬一遇到風浪，危險孰甚！</p>
<p>二·該輪到埠後，即請兵守住駁門，不准乘客上船，至開船之日，始准下船。此時貨已堆滿，駁門不能復開，致男女老幼乘客緣索而上（所帶行李惟有懸掛船外）。又當天雨淋滑，一失足老幼有慘遭滅頂之厄。</p>
<p>三·統艙每人飯費三千二百元，船主規定於售票時併收在內（共四餐，平均每餐八百元）。每天兩餐，菜蔬全無，因如此方可使乘客少吃飯，至於兩晝三夜之活餓生病則全然不管，估計一次航運後，僅飯費一項可刮百數十萬元。</p>
<p>四·購買統艙票後，原可在統艙處地上倒臥，詎料已全被貨物堆滿，又被茶房强搭臥板，每張售賣（約三尺闊）三萬元，此係船主特許。因之無力購買者，眞無立身之地。兩畫三夜之久，欲其不病，烏乎可得！</p>
<p>五·茶房之對乘客，視如囚徒，惡聲厲氣，無可忍受，若與理論，有被毆之辱！</p>
<h3>管理糧食的要圖</h3>
<p>編輯先生：上海的米價，經吳市長嚴厲取締投機以來，保持了多時的平穩，這是我們市民要深深感謝的。不過米價嚴格限制，販運商無利可圖，上海的存米漸漸少下去，將來眞的來源稀少，黑市價將高得不堪設想。再則榖賤傷農，將來也會影響到米的生產量。査米產在本國，銷也在本國，我們與其努力壓低米價，不如聽他有一個合理的價格，莫讓農民太吃虧，叫農民感覺種田不上算。種田虧本的例子，去年已有，今年更難說。管理糧食的要圖，在如何可使生產者消費者中間，竭力减除剝削，勿使商人坐獲鉅利，決不是祇顧壓低米價，就算當能事。我們居住都市中，祇聽到消費者的呼聲，很少聽到生產者的呼聲，所以見解和農人不同。（史遲生）</p>
<h3>剩餘牛奶飫難童</h3>
<p>編輯先生：</p>
<p>報載本市各牛奶棚因營業不振，將牛奶倒入陰溝洞內，貨棄於地，暴殄天物，浪費物資，殊爲可惜。不知是剩餘者？抑爲腐酸者？鄙意如確係好牛奶，不妨按日送往流亡難民收容所，想難民中不乏營養不足，或缺乏乳母之嬰孩及幼童，使若輩可得適當之營養，藉此可保存國家之元氣，而各牛奶棚亦可得一適當之處置，願本埠各牛奶棚主人俯賜採納幸甚！（俞玉噟啓）</p>

<p>欲明瘧疾之治法，必須先知瘧疾之病源，發於秋令處暑白露以後，先寒後熱者爲正瘧。發於春夏冬寒熱無定者爲類瘧，一日一作者病淺，二日一作者較重，三日一作者最深。瘧疾之成因，在外界爲暑後暴凉，納凉受露，榮衛氣阻，在內則爲多進生冷油膩，抑遏胃氣，不能展布。瘧疾不如傷寒之多變化，而三瘧則有淹纏至數年，結爲瘧母，面黃肌瘦者，其胃氣憊也。</p>
<p>瘧疾之特效藥，首推常山草果，常山寒性有毒而作吐，宜薑汁炒用，無痰不成瘧，痰即油膩所變，俗以叫化瘧能食者爲易治，以叫化無從得肉食，胃中無油膩，即不會生痰。常山能吐去其痰，所以謂之刦劑。草果性熱無毒不作吐，能化寒痰，亦能解霧露瘴氣，故與常山並重，亦爲瘧疾之特效藥。由醫學家處方之立塲言之，（醫學家處方，與藥劑師製藥，立塲完全不同，）則僅僅兩味，不能成方，所以寒勝者佐以桂枝生薑，熱勝者佐以黃芩知母，（有時非寒熱並用不可）痰多者佐以半貝橘紅，此皆正瘧之要藥也。至於溫瘧瘴瘧牝瘧牡瘧，因瘧成痞，（瘧母）因瘧成勞，陽處須用角霜附子，陰處須用首烏料豆，病後必須調理脾胃，必須忌猪肉，（昔有木溪鄉農，每喫鮮猪肉，必發强烈之寒戰，發過自已，蓋鄉村多瘧，其人必曾病三瘧者也，）鴨肉生冷介類，綠豆扁豆豆腐綫粉粉皮，滿一百日爲度，百日之內犯之，未有不復發者。病中病後，必須去席，皆病瘧治瘧者，所不可不知也。</p>
<p>〔中醫沈耀先按〕相任先生，行醫數十年，治病有獨到之經騐。所論：爲病人起見飲食習慣與素質之關係，故治療立方，以不同之素質，施以不同之治法，義亦良深。惟瘧疾病源，大都由蚊虫傳佈病菌，故西醫用奎寗治瘧，旨在撲滅病菌，間有用砒汞之劑，如六〇六之類注射，以治惡瘧，由是可知治瘧以殺菌爲第一要義。常山草果二味，確具截瘧之效。常山性寒味苦有毒，此是否具殺菌之功。現在藥理化騐中尚未確定，惟能刺激中樞神經，便體溫下降，又能减少窒素之排泄，阻止體溫高升，確有特效。在中醫以驅逐痰水爲主，草果，性溫味辛，功能截痰灦之瘧，消寒食之積，醫謂：「無痰不作瘧」以二味逐痰之品，無異驅菌之實，意義深長·今以愚見所及，截瘧固以常山草果爲要藥，惟殺虫之品，如烏梅檳榔蜀漆之類，設能參酌症狀加入，則相得益彰矣。</p>

<h3>霍亂史話</h3>
<p>— 鄭偉如</p>
<p>翻開近代的醫籍，霍亂的定義曰「爲急性特異傳染症，病　在迴腸部，症狀之特性爲大量之米泔汁·水瀉·及嘔吐·肌肉痙孿，尿閉虛脫而死，此病爲地方病，常由水路陸路傳播而成流行病，病源爲霍亂弧菌」。看定義就可知道霍亂的病徵，傳染及病源等特性，我國古籍內經所載曰，亂於胃腸，則爲霍亂，又靈樞所載曰淸氣在陰，濁氣在陽，淸濁相干，則爲霍亂，所言多是說明一種腸胃反常的症狀，而不以霍亂爲一種病種，査內經雖未必出於上古，也是周秦間人傳述舊聞，所以當在公元前一千餘年大概我國還無現時的霍亂，偶翻增訂傷寒全書，絞腸痧曰「夏間有不頭痛發熱，但覺小腹疼痛，或心腹俱痛臌脹痞滿，不能屈伸者，人或疑爲陰證，或執爲食生冷過多，不知皆暑火流注，藏腑不能解，故先小腹痛後及徧心腹」，似乎是腸梗阻或內臟結石等症狀，非眞性霍亂，又同書所載乾霍亂吐法「暑氣入腹，惡心腹痛，上吐下瀉，瀉則如水注，此乃暑火暴發，升降不利，淸濁不分，所瀉者皆五臟之津液，宜速止之……此證間有夾食積者，醫家認爲食傷，而用下誤矣，亦有謂其穢濁常去者，不知津液暴涸，元氣頓傷，當立止之爲上，更有吐瀉無物者，爲乾霍亂，令人立斃……此症是否即是今日的眞性乾性霍亂，因所述不盡翔實，所以無法證實。查是書是天啓三年癸亥張鶴騰所「挾古諸名家，參考編集而成帙」，正是公元一六二三年。考近代的所謂乾霍亂，據固田務之經騐，無下瀉物，並非腸內無滲出液，在多數病案中，患者生前未見洩瀉，及至死後解剖，發見腸內充溢液質。霍亂無吐瀉而死者，究屬少數。據阿納司蘭及吐惠寗之所著，對此多無叙述。又可爾平稱，此症極爲少見。麥克否孫竟率直的說，對於乾霍亂從未見過。所以前面所載是否爲酸中毒症狀，也不得而知，又原書所載，暑證即發爲熱病，吐瀉霍亂，積久後發爲瘧痢……則已把吐瀉瘧痢分個不開，眞是牽强附會之談。</p>
<p>一八一三年吳塘出版溫病條辨曰「霍亂一證，長夏最多，本於陽虛寒濕凝聚，關係非輕，傷人於頃刻之間」。又曰「旣吐且痢，寒熱身痛，或不寒熱，但腹中痛，名曰霍亂」。又曰「吐利汗出發熱惡寒，四肢拘急，手足　冷」，由症狀看，頗似眞性霍亂，査是書早於付梓前十年著成，那末我國之有眞性霍亂，早在一八〇三年前，但若以近代科學醫眼光來診斷霍亂，須於患者吐瀉物中檢出眞性霍亂弧菌，方能成立霍亂一症，但是由臨床經驗所知，症狀可以很像霍亂而病人的吐瀉物內不能檢出霍亂弧菌的，也有臨症不似霍亂而可以在糞便內檢出弧形霍亂菌的。</p>
<p>霍亂之家鄉</p>
<p>又據羅吉氏所著霍亂一書所載「於一八一七年印度大流行時之霍亂紀錄果然詳盡準確，當時該症流行旣廣且兇，論者以爲此症乃亘古未有之新病，然據約翰麥克否孫之叙述，則早在公元四百年前之梵文史家及希波革拉第氏之所記，頗類今之霍亂，自一五〇三至一八一七年間，約有十數次如霍亂之流行，在十七世紀，印度東海岸，東印度羣島及中國，已有霍亂之報吿，自一七八一至一七八三年，自加爾各答至麻德拉斯，緬甸，幾乎播及印度各地，及至一七九四年之後，靜止達二十三年之久，迨自一八一七年，始自霍亂之家之孟加拉省向各地傳佈，且播及隣近各邦，及至一八二三年，疫勢始退。」對於該病發生，聚訟紛紜，在一八二六年愷納第即堅持此症必爲接觸傳染。</p>
<p>傳播至歐洲</p>
<p>王勳臣醫林攻錯曰「道光元年辛巴，病吐瀉轉筋者數省，京都尤甚，傷人過多，貧不能葬埋者，國家發帑施棺，月餘之間費數十萬金。」又陳修園醫學實在易載「門人問曰，庚辰辛已歲，吾閩患此而死者不少，然皆起於五月盛於六七月，至白露後漸輕而易愈，且庚辰入夏，大旱而熱甚，人謂病由熱逼，辛已入夏，不澇而寒，人謂病由寒侵，而兩歲病形如一，其故何也」査道光元年辛已即一八二一年，而第一次霍亂大流行而有確實史記的是一八一七—一八二三年，起源於印度的孟加拉省，正是嘉慶二十一年至道光三年，余　　先生　引「陸定圃冷　　　曰自嘉慶庚辰年後，患者不絕，」又引許辛木說云：「道光辛巴，此症盛行。」所以他又說「則是此次霍亂之流行於我國，在嘉慶二十三年，閩省已見流行，至翌年道光元年，則蔓延各省北至燕京，其爲自南而北，顯然可見，」按嘉慶二十三年是一八一八年，當時或自印度經水路傳至閩省，再北上而蔓延京都，査一八二六至一八三七年的印度，波斯及歐洲大流行也是起源於盂加拉省自加爾各答北上至波蘭，瑞典，柏林，維也納，愛丁堡，在一八三二年倫敦就死亡四千，巴黎在十八天內死亡達七千之衆，其時加拿大的魁北克和蒙特利爾，美國的紐約，都被播及，其後葡萄牙，西班牙，意大利，也不倖免，疫勢到一八三八年完全停止，當時交通，尚　幼稚，所以從孟加拉至歐洲，達五年之久，後來因爲交通的日臻發達，往往於數月之間，即自印度傳播歐洲。</p>
<p>歐洲的流行</p>
<p>在一八四七至一八四九的歐洲流行，據說俄國就有百萬的死亡，英國也有五萬三千餘死亡，在一八四九年時，斯諾醫生即創言霍亂是由於病人嘔吐洩瀉物內含有毒素，此素倘由別人吞食，就可在腸內大量生產，並稱由於下水道的不善，排洩物可以琉入江湖井池，若以該水作爲飲料，即起傳染，同時波達也聲言霍亂是由於在腸內生長的微生物作祟所致，但是在一八五六年英國皇家內科學院之風向傳播毒素說，甚囂塵上，把以上二氏的理論，推翻得一乾二凈。</p>
<p>世界大流行</p>
<p>以後數年如一八五五，一八六三，一八六六等幾次世界大流行，起源總是在印度，向鄰近各邦及歐洲傳佈，在一八七九—一八八三年因爲印度鐵路交通發達，所以向各處傳播，更加快速，在一八八三年埃及死亡達五萬之衆，德法英均派專家去實地勘察，最後由德之郭霍敎授在病人吐瀉物中發見弧狀細菌，霍亂病原之謎，至此，眞相大白，當時麥克南麥拉對於霍亂研究，頗具心得，彼已假定霍亂患者的米泔汁排洩物內含有微生物，但是英國政府拒絕資助麥氏研究這一問題，及至郭霍氏調査團發表組菌病原說後，英政府即派細菌專家到印度去調查，但是調査的結果，竟否定郭霍氏的見解。</p>
<p>在一八九二—一八九五年間，霍亂的傳播較前更速，在未及五閱月中，已由印度西北諸省，竄入聖彼德堡（列寗格勒），德之漢堡，也爲波及，並且在數天之內，傳至英美二國，在一九一八至一九一九年，印度竟有五十萬人死於大疫。</p>
<p>印度發源地</p>
<p>看了上面世界霍亂的流行，每次多是從印度發軔，而各次多由孟加拉省恒河下游三角洲爲病源做播的中心，故孟加拉有霍亂之家之稱，我國自民前九十五年由印度大流行，而傳入我國後，以後年有流行，死亡很多。</p>
<p>國醫的理論</p>
<p>査我國儒醫之身經霍亂流行經騐，向著醫立說的，當推王孟英，他著有霍亂論（一八三七年）及隨息居重訂霍亂論（一八六二年）等書，皆取內經傷寒論之說，曉曉於寒　之爭，我們當然不能苛求，但是我們若讚許起的霍亂　　說，所論「霍亂，有稱爲吊腳痧者，即霍亂之　而轉筋者，原非另有一證也，」「霍亂，有呼爲絞腸痧者，即乾霍亂也」「霍亂證，無論四肢　冷畏寒，舌白，一派陰寒氣象，畢呈顯露……須知霍亂總以暑熱而成，有熱極似寒者，即假寒也，所以徐靈胎有寒霍亂百不得一之說」。又說「霍亂係因熱而成者，經云，不遠熱則熱至，熱至則身熱，吐下霍亂，奈病源三因等書，咸謂霍亂，無不本之風泠，遂致薛立齋，張介賓輩，專主於寒，從此印定後人眼目，凡患熱霍亂者，皆被此數公殺之矣。」又曰「霍亂屬熱，內經文也，劉守眞云，三焦爲水榖傳化之道路，熱氣甚，則傳化失常，而吐利霍亂，火性躁動故也，奈薛立齋之流，敢以寒多立論，貽誤後世」査許起著是書，是一八八八年，當時郭霍已經證實弧狀菌爲霍亂病原，且斐連氏已試用活弧菌行免疫法，而許起尚引經據典，斷斷於寒熱之爭，而跋語之「昔溫太真燃犀以照水怪，歷歷可數，……是說奚翅燃犀之明，僅照水怪哉」更覺無可遁形的，並非是霍亂之屬寒屬熱呀。</p>
<p>預防與環境</p>
<p>我人平時形容數目衆多以「恒河沙數」來表示，但是世界上由恒河下游爲中心向各處散播而成的霍亂流行病死亡數，可以與恒河沙數相媲美，我們翻歷史，想由歷史的敎訓借爲鑑鏡，考近代的歐洲，除東南一小部份外，幾未再有霍亂的流行，即以日本，荷屬東印度羣島，星加坡，英屬馬來半島等處，霍亂的災害，均呈消滅之趨向，這是因爲預防注射和環境衛生相輔而行的成績，但是祇有預防注射而不講究環境衛生，也是事倍功微的，若有淸潔的環境，再輔以預防，當然更好了，但是我們若相信病從口入這句話，則覺得環境的衛生更屬重要，我們現在爲人預防注射的，還祗限於大家引爲可怕的霍亂一症，至於傷寒的預防注射，能實行的究屬少數，而痢疾的防止，更非此所能奏效。</p>
<p>如果環境衛生優良，衛生組織嚴密，霍亂實在也無足畏懼，記得霍亂在歐洲流行時，柏林四　俄奧法等國，疫勢猖獗，柏林始終與外界維持商業及交通關係，但是霍亂仍不能在柏林駐足，已充份說明環境及衛生行政之重要性。</p>
<p>飲水與霍亂</p>
<p>筆者不憚求詳，再來引歷史的事實來證明上說，在一八九二年漢堡市民死於霍亂者達八千大百餘人，當時漢堡市的飲水是取汲於易北河，但是該市的排水亦泄洩入河，由於潮水的關係，排洩物又倒流到取水源之上游，市民的飲水，先引至池塘內，作爲沉　之用，但無　水設備，又以市民增多，需水量也加多，所以水被導至蓄水塘內，往往未經充份停留，起沉澱作用，即由市民取用，所以染疫而死的很多，同時亞妥那與漢堡毗隣，飲水也取汲於易北河，一切情形，除飲水須經砂濾外，悉與漢堡相仿，但是染霍亂而死的，祗三百廿八人，翌年漢堡市增設飲水砂濾設備，　勢大减。</p>
<p>至此，筆者再叙述蒼蠅散佈病菌的方法，以作結束，査弧菌對於乾燥之抵抗極弱，在五十度下，十分鐘即死，所以蒼蠅身翅腿足的傳播病菌，尚非重要，但是弧菌能於其腸內生存有數日之久，考蒼蠅吮吸食物，以流質及半流質爲主，若遇固形食物，蠅即迴吐液質在食物上，待食物稍被溶化後再行吮吸，所以若其食道含有弧菌，我們的食物就被染汚，而且蒼蠅每於吮吸時排洩其糞便於食物上，所以這個蒼蠅，若是已經在霍亂病人排洩物上停留過後，再在我人食物人停留，我們的食物也可能染上霍亂菌的。不過，大的霍亂流行，歷史吿訴我們，總是由於水的汚染。蒼蠅固然也可能傳播若干零星的散發的病例，但是單單撲滅了蒼蠅，並不能遏制霍亂的流行。綜上所述，我人祗要充份供給市民以淸潔的飲水，塡塞土井池塘，淸除垃圾糞穢，取締不潔的飲食攤販，那末非但霍亂一病，就是其他的傳染病，必可减少至最低限度。</p>
<h3>鏈黴素近況</h3>
<p>— 孚康</p>
<p>在今天，正有着許多人在等待鏈黴素（Streptomyein）的供給，美國波士頓開福博士說，</p>
<p>美國醫學協會雜誌上載，開福博士現在給醫師們帶來了這藥品，他說：</p>
<p>『它主要的興趣……是去決定她的效力與在某種傳染病中的毒性，而那些疾病却是磺　胺藥劑，配尼西靈與別種療法所不能治愈的，……他們正有很多的病留待着我們去研究。」</p>
<p>能獲得鏈黴素的，國家研究會約佔百分之三十一，其餘的都分配給陸軍，海軍，美國公共衛生處，戰士管理處。</p>
<p>疾病之用，鏈黴素治療的，現在計有傷寒，食物中毒，浪熱，與　熱，某種生殖尿路的傳染病，血中毒，腦膜炎，肺炎，菌原性內膜炎，而對於結核則僅作有限制之研究。</p>
<h3>貧血與補血藥（中）</h3>
<p>— 張昌紹</p>
<p>（三）貧血的影響</p>
<p>大家知道血是身體裏最寳貴的東西，身體裏每一個細胞所需的養料，都得直接的或間接的靠血來供應·而最重要的養料，却並不是蛋白質或維生素；氧（養氣）是身體細胞所最需要的養料。愈是重要的器官，態是缺不得氧。腦缺氧數秒鐘，即致人事不省；心缺氧一二分鐘，即停止跳動。</p>
<p>氧自肺臟吸入，全賴血液運輸至全身各部器官組織。而血液的携氧能力幾完全由於血內的紅血球。據現在所知，携氧是紅血球的最重要機能，也幾乎是唯一的機能。貧血旣然是血液中紅血球數的减少，那末貧血病人的携氧能力自然要打一個折扣，因此不免要發生或輕或重的缺氧狀態·</p>
<p>因爲腦與心最缺不得氧，缺氧的時候也是這兩個器官最早受到影響，所以貧血所發生的種種症狀，主要是腦與心缺氧的結果。自然貧血症所致的缺氧是相對的，不是絕對缺氧，所以不致人事不省或心跳停止，貧血很輕的病人，自己不覺有什麽異狀，不過爬高坡，或稍稍劇列運動的時候，比較常人容易氣急心跳，稍重一些的病人，便自覺體力不佳，稍勞即感疲乏，疲乏後亦不能迅速恢復。同學們的劇烈運動，如球戲游泳之類自然不敢奉陪，就是上樓梯稍急步行稍快的時候，就喘做一團，一顆心彷彿要跳到口外一樣。這種病人也常覺眩暈，耳鳴，容易暈倒。脚踝部往往略有浮腫，至於重症的貧血病人，就是不勞動的也容易氣急心跳，勞動的時候這種病狀自然更是厲害。</p>
<p>長期貧血不加糾正，則全身組織都受到缺氧的影饗，因此不僅是一個病夫，並且也早老早衰。</p>
<p>（四）貧血的原因</p>
<p>紅血球的壽命比人的壽命要短促得多，自生成至破壞的一段時間，平均不過三星期左右。在正常情形下，血內不斷的有老的紅血球破壊死去，也不斷的有新的紅血球生長出現。骨髓是紅血球新生的地步。骨髓有什麼病，或者受某種　物所傷害，紅血球新生的機能往往發生障碍，而致嚴重的貧血。這種貧血稱做再生障碍性貧血，目前尚無特效的治療，得病後病人往往死得很快。幸而道種貧血很是少見，血色不好的人千萬不要杯弓蛇影，杞人憂天。</p>
<p>普通的貧血百分之九十九以上却由於紅血球的額外損失，骨髓補充不及。慢性出血或反覆出血是紅血球的向外損失；加速破壞則造成紅血球的體內損失。</p>
<p>痔瘡，胃潰瘍，十二指腸潰瘍等病人往往不知不覺的反覆出血而致貧血。痔瘡病人往往每次如厕時略有出血，一次出血量雖不多，但日積月累，其總量即甚可觀。胃潰瘍與十二指腸潰瘍的出血很是多見，但大多數並不嘔出而經由大便排出，因此病人常不甚注意。潰瘍病人如排黑色大便，即係出血的象徵，宜即積極醫治，以免發生危險性大出血。</p>
<p>成年的婦女，因爲月經的關係，比男子容易得到貧血。每次行經時血液的損失總量平均在二英兩左右，一年總量便達二十四英兩之多。如果飲食物營養足够標準，自然補充得很快，不致發生貧血，若是營養不良，或月經過多，便難免發生貧血了。</p>
<p>腸內寄生虫，特別是鈎虫病，也容易產生貧血·但蛔虫普通並不是貧血的原因。許多母親們看見孩子們『血色不好』便疑心到蛔虫（最普通的腸虫）作祟，實在是錯誤的。</p>
<p>紅血球在血內加速破壞在醫學上稱做溶血。溶血也是貧血的原因。許多傳染病，特別是慢性瘧疾和肺癆等，往往產生溶血性貧血。這是因微生物分泌一種　質使紅血球破壞所致。幾種毒　也能產生同樣的情</p>
<p>以上所說的各種貧血，都是病原已經明瞭的，普通的貧血都歸於此類。此外有一種貧血稱惡性貧血·病原不明，病勢極重，如不治療，往往死亡。這種惡性貧血在中國極爲少見，在一萬個貧血病人中恐　　難得見到一個，所以吾們儘可不必考到他。</p>

<h3>薩洛陽</h3>
<p>— 曹錫珍</p>
<p>美國文壇上有過這樣一件不可思議的事，那便是：　管有一位作家，他已獲得廣大讀者羣的推崇與愛戴；　管他的著作出版後會不脛而走，銷行全世界，被翻譯成好多國的文字；　管他的作品是那麼有意義而富有力量。可是，他在美國的一般見仁見智的批評家們各執一端的批評之下所得的禮物却是　譽參半。</p>
<p>薩洛陽在中國新文藝讀者羣中，已是一個很熟悉的名字。他無數的短篇，已由呂淑湘，陳原兩先生和筆者等相繼譯出後介紹給了讀者。而他的最佳短篇集「我的名呌阿拉木」和長篇「人類的喜劇」也都由呂淑湘和柳無垢兩先生分別譯出。（前者由開明書店譯出，書名即用其中一篇「石榴樹」爲題；後者由文光書店出版。可惜這兩本書都是在勝利前於重慶出版的，勝利後上海尚未再版。這對上海愛好薩洛陽的讀者，不能不說是種遺憾。）</p>
<p>薩洛陽，父母都是阿美尼亞人，一九〇八年生於美國加里福尼亞州弗里諾斯城。他沒有好好的進過學校讀過什麽書，少年時代便做報童，送電報的孩子及在農場中做打雜工作來維持他自己獨立的生活。他在十三歲的時候，就想使自己成爲一個作家。那時他是一個送電報的孩子，白天工作，晚上自修，讀些小說，也開始學習寫作了。十四歲算是進學校讀了一些書，但十五歲又離開學校，此後與學校就此吿別了。</p>
<p>薩洛陽投稿的命運，正如一般作家所經歷的道路，同樣是不幸的。稿子儘管一篇篇地寄出去，結果却老是被退回，被編輯先生到字紙簍裏，後來他覺得因襲前輩作家的作風，結果永遠是碰璧；於是，他決心創造「薩洛陽自己的風格」。果然，「薩洛腸風」的「楸韆架上勇敢的靑年」那篇小說，不但被編輯先生看中了，發表了，而且獲得了一部份批評家的鑑賞。給予好評。（之後他又繼續寫了十幾個短篇，出版以「鞦韆架上勇敢的靑年」爲題的短篇小說集，這也就是他的處女集。）這種批評，鼓勵了薩洛陽向創造自己獨特的風格的道路上邁進，而寫「薩洛陽風」的小說底決心，就也越加堅定起來了。</p>
<p>他的小說的銷路並不太壊，一大筆不小的版稅，供給他旅行了蘇聯的旅費。蘇聯的印象，使他寫了「鄂木斯克的歌者」和「俄國作家」那幾篇短篇小說。這些，後來都收在一本呌做「和平，眞怪呀！」的短篇小說集裏。</p>
<p>他是一個多產作家，直到現在，他已寫下了五百多個短篇小說。出版的短篇小說集有「呼吸」，「孩子們」，「和平，眞怪啊！」，「三乘三」，「我的名叫阿拉木」，「可怕的虎」。「人類的喜劇」是長篇。他最近的短篇集是「親愛的孩子」，長篇是「賈克遜經歷」。</p>
<p>他的小說，多半是自傳性的，大都是寫他少年與幼年時代報童，店員，農塲助手，送電報生和學生時代的生活和生活上所接觸的一些人物。譬如說「人類的喜劇」中那口送電報孩子，就是他幼年時代的剪影。</p>
<p>而在一九三八年以後，他不但繼續寫小說，並且開始當試劇本的創作了。他所寫的劇本有「我的心呀在高原」，「愛情是甜蜜的歌曲」和「你的生命時間」。其中以「你的生命時間」最爲成功，曾經獲得「紐約戲劇評論」和「普力資」兩種戲劇獎金。他的劇作都是幽默性的喜劇。</p>
<p>因爲薩洛陽的作品，有他自己特創的風格，他不致力於修飾和辭藻上的華麗與堆砌，不講究文法，不喜歡研究結構與技巧，不愛矯揉做作；祇是很平淡的，隨筆所至，用簡　的對話，加上一些最經濟的連絡對話間所必需的說明，蘊藏進他自己所計劃的主題，便完成他的作風了，這種作風，當然引起某些拘殘守缺。專門講究形式上的完整的批評家們的一種惡劣的甚至中傷的批評，也就是很自然的事了。說他的作品不講究文法，修辭，技巧與結構，這些，當然是對的。然而，批評家們完全抹殺了他獨創的風格上偉大的成就而就壓根兒說薩洛陽要不得，那也似乎有欠公平吧？</p>
<p>至於薩洛陽筆下所刻劃來的人物的性格，都是很單純的，有時候甚至會懐疑世界上是否會存在這種單純的人物。可是，這些單純的人物，却都是挺可愛的，可愛得令人捧腹而狂笑，着急得令人跳脚喊救命，從這些人物中，我們可以看到薩洛陽對人類的愛與憎，友與敵的理解；而，正也反映着薩洛陽的人生觀與世界觀。</p>
<p>薩洛陽一方面是被詆毀着，而另一方面，却也得到一部份較爲客觀的批評家們的讚美。</p>
<p>薩洛陽初期所遭到的批評，可以說與美國偉大的民主詩人惠特曼完全相似的。而且薩洛陽與惠特曼一樣，對於外界的批評，都很少顧忌。的確，他始終遵照他的作風繼續寫作下去。薩洛陽曾經這樣回答過批評家們：「我有我自己的作風。無論你們怎樣批評，我總是向自己旣定的創作之路前進。」「我所要說的，就祗是一個簡單的故事，我愛怎麼說就怎麽說。我不懂修辭的法則，我不明白作文的秘訣。」此外，他對批評家的反批評是：「也許作家比批評家看得遠，也許批評家比作家看得遠。」</p>
<p>薩洛陽今日的成功，不是別的，就是因爲他能够創造自己的風格，沒有做任何一個作家的模仿者或尾巴。對、作家該創造自己的風格！</p>
<p>第一次世界大戰時·他是一個報童。而這次大戰，他爲了瞭解戰爭，充實生活，毅然加入軍隊服務了。去年勝利後他已從歐洲回到美國，繼續其寫作生活。薩洛陽並沒有使讀者失望，他的「賈克遜的經壓」就是以戰爭爲題材所完成的長篇傑作·</p>
<p>薩洛陽還年靑，他的努力，在他自己，一定有更豐富的收獲；在讀者，一定有更多更結實更豐滿的食糧。薩洛陽是決不會使讀者，他自己和時代失望的，他有創作的力量，他有他自己的創作方法。——一九四六，七，十六。</p>
<h3>山城的霧</h3>
<p>— 石碚</p>
<p>霧，像愛情一樣，在山峰的心上游戲，生出種種美麗的變幻·——泰戈爾</p>
<p>住　重　的人，自會賞　　的神奧。從每年八月起至次年的四月裏，這是霧季的時節，渺渺茫茫的，像黎明前撒到瀚海的漁網，一絲絲，一縷縷地籠罩着天宇，山崗，房舍，江河，也沾結在人們的臉上，心上。看着這團　密結的霧，正包藏着人們的哀　，憤懣，與希望。</p>
<p>我們常以霧的變幻，來預測天氣的晴雨：在淸晨的時分，若看見一陣陣的霧煙，從長江和　陵江的江面，或者從山崗下的小　　間，輕輕地慢慢地，結集上昇，逐漸圍攏成濃重的大霧時，那麼，這一天的天氣一定是晴天的。但是，若遇着淸早的霧，只是疏疏落落地，隨意撒盪時，這一天，一定是微風細雨的天氣；在這時候江上飄着淡淡的霧，細雨斜舞霧中，這就是國書裏「煙雨歸帆」的眞景了。然而，這是與晴天的霧完全兩樣的；我愛晴天裏的濃霧，因爲她是那麽渾厚深邃，如看不透的玻珠，可是她又會使人響往猜探，我也愛雨中的霧，因爲她似輕柔的薄紗，似皎餃的舞裳，從隱約矇矓的隔離間，可以窺見跳在窗前的雨點，也可以從窗前眺望遠遠稀淡的歸帆。</p>
<p>蒼穹旣是濃霧的晴天，早晨看不見混和在霧裏的人家的炊煙，大地被鎖在霧裏，從家裏跑出街上，根距三四尺遠的地方，便無法看得淸楚，前後來去的汽車，都開着車頭的電燈，響着警號喇叭，緩緩地行，有時還要停下來，探路前進。黃包車夫叫吆着，他們走得更遲緩，從兩路口到小什字，馬路較平直，走起來比較方便，但是要穿過熱鬧的蓮花街和陝西路的下坡多彎地帶，就得格外當心的了。</p>
<p>在霧氛裏，前面的傳來—喧嚷的市聲，但是看不見活動着的人，站在儲奇門高聳的城堞上，除了聽見對岸海棠溪紛擾的人聲，和江邊船戶的喧嘩外，一切都看不見了，這時你似乎感覺得自已是在夢中，細　人間勞碌悲歡的生活交響樂，會懐疑人間究竟是眞是幻！</p>
<p>上午八九點鐘的時候，太陽掛在天空，光　敵不過霧的阻隔，只能似月亮般顯露了顏面；太陽似月照，這是有趣的奇景，所謂「蜀犬吠日」也就是這時候的情形。沒有强烈的光綫刺眼，我們儘可以抬起　　着太陽，像欣賞滿月的柔和淸美；直至日上中天，陽光才漸漸把霧氣　散，這時候太陽光始完全照射到地上，江上的餘霧，似蒸汽般消失了，但遠山峰巔上的白霧，還是像絹帶般經着不散。</p>
<p>白天過去，霧又跟着夜的脚步輕移而來了。</p>
<p>夜裏的霧，是帶有點兒寒意的，霧中街上的電燈放射着寒光，守看着暗淡的夜霧，無聲無息地游移。當這時候，若打開窗子，外面的霧，便和燈光絞打一樣，慢慢地便要擁進室內，直至室內的溫度把它消化成小小的水點，貼附在壁上·</p>
<p>記起戰時，重慶的人，都要感謝霧給他們的恩惠，因爲在半年多的霧季時節裏、霧像防空網一般庇護着　個山城，敵機是不敢輕易來犯的，人們可以不受空襲的危險了，這是霧給重慶造下天然的保障，現在問起山城裏的人，他們還能津津樂道霧季裏的安逸。</p>
<p>除重慶被稱爲有名的霧都之外，倫敦也是世界聞名的霧都。據說倫敦的霧是黃赭色的，但重慶的霧是帶着淸白稀乳般的色澤，這大概是因爲倫敦的工廠多，氣流混合火烟，霧也混成黃烟般的沉重了，重慶週圍，山丘帶水，幾乎完全是靑一色的自然的本體，沒有過多工廠的濁烟，所以霧還保持着淸飄淡沫的情調。</p>
<p>英國人都讚賞倫敦的霧，愛倫敦的霧，他們說：英國人之所以特別富有穩健的政治風底，有含蓄深慮的性格，皆是得助於倫敦的霧默化陶養之功，他們的詩人，也說霧能給他們有遐思的靈感，他們常常吟頌霧的情趣，似這樣說來，霧之　英人，可算是一種靈妙的甘　了。但是我國中國人，一談到霧，便聯想到陰霾可惡的一面，這並不是我們缺乏欣賞的智慧，也不是我們低能，不會捉摸霧的神諦，而是因爲我們自己只懂得在霧中苟安，藉霧的迷黯，遮矇別人的視野，偷偷摸摸的幹着光天白日下不容許示現的事，因此多少人被騙被害，而作惡者可以逍遙自在，於是，我們便天天咀咒了人爲的霧，漸漸連天然間的霧，也成了我們厭惡咀咒的對象。</p>
<p>重慶在遠古的年代已有了霧，今年明年也一樣，就算是無窮的未來吧，天然的霧還是依然在霧季到來，彌漫着這山城，但是我們對霧的看法，是否還似過去一樣憎厭的態度，那就決定於自已了！</p>
<p>山城的霧季，不久又到了，我在千里外的海濱城市，再看不見那柔和的霧影，我懐念着它，因爲我是愛那深奧奇妙的舖在大地上的白色霧影呵！</p>

<h3>我要剛強</h3>
<p>— 中原</p>
<p>我從沒有吿訴過你這句話；你也一定料不到像我這樣軟弱的人會說這句話；在深夜，在淸晨，在幽靜的夢中，連我自己也希奇怎麼到今天，我居然能說這樣一句話。然而我要吿訴你，自從你像一片奇異的亮光照進了我的生命，又如曇花一現地倏然而去後，我的心中就有了這句話：我要剛强！</p>
<p>我並不否認常常在凄黑的雨夜爲你流着眼淚。我也並不否認自從那個日子以後，我藏起了你的信件，藏起了你的照片，藏起了你給予我的一點最後的紀念，在那隻破舊的小抽屜裏。到今天我還沒有敢開過那隻抽屜。計算一下日子，已有六個月了。不過我爲意吿訴你，這六個月的日子裏，我終於用理智的盾牌抵住了情感的猛襲，我竟像以前一樣活着，而且在說着這句話：我要剛强！</p>
<p>當然我仍永遠記着那個小小的房間，就是我第一次認識你的地方。我也永遠記着八年前和你多次的會見，在那條靜僻的小弄裏。我更永遠記着有一次你曾用奇怪的眼光注視着我，你默默地嘆了口氣，走了。然而雖然這些痛苦的記憶統統活鮮鮮地在我眼前，我却從痛苦中挺起頭來，在喊着這句話：我要剛強！</p>
<p>記得你曾向我說過你要到我的地方來看我。如今我仍在夢想着有一天會出現一個突然的神蹟：你又站在我的面前，對我微笑，對我注視。那時候，我或許會像小孩子一樣向你痛哭流涕，或許會伸出冰冷的兩手緊握住你。然而我相信，末了的時候，我一定會揩乾眼淚放下你的手，向你說這麼一句：「我要剛强！」</p>

<h3>雙宿雙飛（九六）</h3>
<p>— 趙清閣</p>
<p>「董先生！」麗華輕輕呌了一聲。</p>
<p>董劭凌正在看書，一抬頭看見麗花　蹰走進，連忙應着站起來。</p>
<p>「喂，小華！怎麼這樣晚一個人跑出來了？有什麽事嗎？坐下談談！」董劭凌看着麗華滿臉沉　的神氣，不禁詫異地問她，一而　了她到屋子裏。</p>
<p>麗華不坐，也不言語，直楞着立在董劭凌的書桌前，時爾用含情的眼光，向董劭凌掃射着。</p>
<p>「怎麼不言語呀，小華！瞧你這個不高興的樣子，是不是又跟那個混蛋拉胡琴的生氣了？」董劭凌說着，親切地拍了拍麗華的肩，像哄着一個小孩子。</p>
<p>麗華依然不響，心裏像在想着別的，不住凝視董劭凌的週身；董劭凌的一切什物；彷彿一個雕刻家，在這裏做着鐫記的工作。</p>
<p>「怎麼，小華？你是在跟我生氣嗎？」董劭凌疑惑地問。有些莫明其妙起來。</p>
<p>「不是，董先生！」麗華這才開了口。</p>
<p>「那麽你今天爲什麽這樣不高興呢？不理我，也不向我微笑了。董劭凌拉住她的手說。</p>
<p>「我，我難過！」麗華囁嚅地說。</p>
<p>「爲什麼呢？喂，小小年紀不應當常常這樣悲觀！以後快活點吧，小華！」黃劭凌溫慰地撫着她說。</p>
<p>「我，我…我明天就走了！」麗華終于抽噎地說出她心裏痛苦的　結了！</p>
<p>「是不是到武漢去？我聽劉先生說，她也同你一道。」去董劭凌並不驚訝地說。</p>
<p>「嗯！」麗華背過臉去哭了！</p>
<p>「到武漢去很好，而且有劉先生陪你，也不寂寞。多走一個地方，多長一些見識。你該高興才是，爲什麽反而難過呢？「董劭凌走過去扳起她的下顎，用手拍着她的　說：「捨不得開封嗎？那麽等戰事平息了，再來吧！」</p>

<h3>面子與旅費</h3>
<p>— 少夫</p>
<p>上海的一件滿天大事，現在已　入牛角尖裏了！</p>
<p>我對體育外行，對體育界一向也無接觸，對於由鬧鱉扭而成僵局的華南隊義賽事件，以一個有理智，識大體的市民立塲，不得不憤激地說幾句話。</p>
<p>事態演變到目前——華南隊以未得福利基金會同意拒不出場，李惠堂即將率隊返香港——爲止，我以爲千錯萬錯，都怪市體協會的不是，這話怎講，並不是因爲市體協會現在「上了十字架」，被人家「紮了台型」，而是市體協會太老實，以爲大家眞正是爲了救濟湘中蘇北的災民的哩！</p>
<p>可憐呀！七進七出的戰塲上的三湘飢餓的人們呀！</p>
<p>可憐呀！現在仍然是砲火終天的蘇北廬舍爲墟輾轉溝　的人們呀！</p>
<p>你們，你們千萬隻眼睛注視着那隻皮球，你們的生命在人家的脚下，人家不屑用脚一踢，又奈何？</p>
<p>倘使大家眞正爲了災民，我以爲疙瘩便不會如此之多，這有根據嗎？有的，且抄錄此中人語數則作爲索引：</p>
<p>第一章</p>
<p>李惠堂：且五位發起以「來滬之便」，邀華南隊參加義賽，五位中之孫夫人，實並未同意。</p>
<p>容啓兆：你（作者按：指李惠堂）見福利會事情鬧僵，曾表示決遵照體協會意旨行事；今忽然翻悔，又須徵求福利會同意，何以自圓其說？體協會原不欲辦理義賽，爲顧全旣成事實，乃接受吳市長等五位要求，「破例」主持。</p>
<p>東南日報記事：若市體協肯不堅持「立場」，固仍有旋轉乾坤之一綫也。……所隔膜者，厥在體育是體育，體育與法統之區別而已。</p>
<p>周家騏：華南隊長李惠堂，前日曾往過訪，對體協會各項措置，原則上表示同意；惟華南係受福利會之邀而來，在面子上，應由足球委員會書面邀請福利會同意後，方能出場云。</p>
<p>第二章</p>
<p>新聞報浮生先生：對於這次義賽的開支，即使必要的，也須極力節省，而華南隊的「旅費」，更宜嚴格稽核發給，幾千萬幾千萬的淘金方式，我們絕對反對的。</p>
<p>新聞報記事：記者並又問李君，外傳在你們離港之前，此間曾有三千五百萬元川資匯港，是否屬實？李答：確有其事，惟數目稍有出入，因本隊一切洽裝費及川資，所費甚鉅，此一損失，乃福利會方面的事</p>
<p>大公報記事：據李惠堂表示：此次化費甚大，恐在星東隊征滬之上（按星東會獲旅費五千三百三十四萬元）。周家騏答以正當旅費開支，當由體協會負責，於義賽收入中撥付，確實數字，則無法預計。</p>
<p>兩章索引讀畢，你聰明的讀者當能明白就喪，至於體協會爲什麼去函香港阻止華南隊不必來滬，華南隊爲什麽依然渡海而來，……等等，則又不必細表了。</p>
<p>「破」了的「例」，即使修補也還是有疤痕的，於戲？</p>
<h3>泰山的身價多少人靠泰山吃飯</h3>
<p>— 東方荊</p>
<p>對於全世界無數的讀者，和電影觀衆們，泰山是一個漂亮的年輕男子，生活在非洲的叢林巾，有着壯健的胸部，從不穿衣服，僅在腰際圍一塊布。他在大樹問盪來盪去，走手空拳和野獸搏鬥，保護善良，懲罰惡者。</p>
<p>對於「出版人周刋」的編者們，泰山的故事是荒誕不經的，批評得體無完膚。</p>
<p>對於這個森林之王的創作者——愛德伽·萊斯·勃羅，泰山是一筆好生意。</p>
<p>勃羅和多數的作家不問，並不認爲自己的作品可以永存不朽，他甚至不把自己當作一個作家，而自認爲一個卓越的生意人，製造出一個幻想的人物在出版界中賺到最多的錢。</p>
<p>勃羅已經靠泰山賺了一千萬的美金。包括版稅，電影攝片稅，無綫電播音稅，及二百種報紙上的滑稽圖片，還有許多商品使用泰山商標，如麫包，冰淇淋杯子，刀子，玩具，書包袋，練習簿，弓箭，橡皮糖，假面，森林服裝等等。</p>
<p>其中有三百萬，是電影公司攝製泰山影片的版稅，泰山電影已拍了二十三部。勃羅最近和小沙爾公司訂立合同，把泰山的電影攝製權租給他們，定期二十年，租費四百萬元·勃　　錢的秘訣，是他從來沒有把「泰山」這個人物賣掉，他祇是出租。</p>
<p>自從一九二三年，愛德伽·萊斯。勃羅公司，是泰山的唯一主人。</p>
<p>第一部泰山小說是「人猿泰山」，一九一二年，發表於一本軟性刋物上。自此以後。勃羅寫了五十五本暢銷小說，賣掉三千五百萬本，有六十種不同語音的版本。對於一個直到三十六歲，才開始寫作的人，這可說是一種奇跡。而他最初的寫小說，還是爲了衣食所迫，　養活一個老婆，兩個孩子·</p>
<p>勃　是一個高大，　肩膀的漢子，有一張大的，橢圓形的臉，禿頂，皮膚棕色；看樣子，誰也不相信他會有七十一歲。</p>
<p>最新的一本泰山書，叫做“Tarzan　and　the　Foreigh　Legion"是兩年之前寫的，爲了紙荒的綠故，要到一九四七年才出版。</p>
<h3>可怕的痳瘋!</h3>
<p>— 方君</p>
<p>我參觀過痳瘋院，痳瘋院裏收容的病者眞使人驚心怵目，形形色色，無狀不有，拳手曲脚，行動蹣跚，眉脫月眵，面腫耳大而膚色奇特，尤令人望而生怖。此種疾苦，爲毒至烈，且易傳染，殆不可治。董近代醫藥，對此仍無有效發明，是以患此症的人，終於無法逃出苦海。據患者自說，其癢入骨，搔不可得，故甚難熬，視死尤苦百倍，或爲微菌深入之故。又有人說，這是濕毒至極之病，病的徵候，似有一定公式，初起必爲暈癬，癢不可當，漸漸擴大，即成瘋疾。其是否如此，我沒有加以研究。但廣東人對癬之注意，或綠於此。</p>
<p>痳瘋症患者，雖欲不與人世隔絕，人亦必與之遠離，畏之甚於瘟疫。故廣東農村，對此症的病患者，深惡痛絕，一有發現，必迫使遠離，否則置之死地，不少憐恤·就以筆者的故鄉而言，全邑有痳瘋症患者棲息地一所，名「發瘋墩」有人管理，異常嚴密，一經投止，則不能越雷池一步。但病者投進，須先納費，交收淸楚，始許進門，一入其中，終身不得復出。據說：痳瘋症息者離家之時，先將祖宗牌位倒轉，屋瓦揭穿，然後出門，謂如此始不致有遺傳。這是農村對麻瘋症患者一般的習例，要亦所以表示決絕的意思，不祗帶有迷信性質而已·</p>
<p>農村中對付痳瘋症，患者除目動有資投進「發瘋墩」以終餘年之外，沒有錢的病者，則予以處死。處死之法，是迫致指定的荒嶺深谷，飲以滲和鴉片烟汁的濃酒，使病患者大醉，即投入預先掘成的深壙，立覆泥土，與地同平，是謂生葬，其法雖虐，然爲了一村民衆的安全，亦屬不得已之舉。至該病患者的家，則拆去屋瓦，封閉門戶，一任風雨侵蝕，烈日曝晒，以消其餘毒；而附近隣居，盡在門前焚燒木糠（即木　），使濃烟滿室，竟日不敢，是謂消毒。</p>
<p>此外，農村又有一種懸賞，捕捉痳瘋症患者的條例，凡見有逃避上述生死兩法，棲息購野的病者，應即予以捕殺，將其掩理，例有重賞。原因，此輩病患者食生之念甚熾，所以對本身疾害，務盡方法，使其隱跡，不致外露（鄉人名爲不出面。這種　跡不露的方法，最優的是性交，——病者與非病者的性交，和吃死嬰之肉，病者逃在曠野，便是作爲這種療疾方法的準備，　有死嬰，即盜來烹食，如遇異性，便劫而强奸（女性即爲誘奸）。盜死嬰烹食，固屬可惡，而强奸異性，爲此中法律與道德所不容。蓋所奸之人，已爲傳染，三日之後，亦爲一痳瘋症患者了。其殘酷實罪不容誅，鄉人之必加殺害，正由於此。</p>
<p>輕性痳瘋症患者，初不露面，但鄉人對此，甚有認識，好似特具法眼，如有發覺，人們則將榕葉榕鬚之類暗置井中，輕性痳瘋症患者一經誤飲，其毒即發，大耳脫眉，　面拳指，渾身癢，脚底穿，至此乃無從掩飾，非　開其家室不可了。</p>
<p>麻瘋症亦可於病未發作時療治即愈的。前有鄉人，夜行山野，見一少女，（即誘姦男性的輕性痳瘋症患者）甚美，利其孤獨，就與性交，歸而覺悟大懼；但他頗明醫道，急往牛棚中取一牯牛，殺而剖其腹，盡去腸臟，乘有熱氣，赤身　入腹內，並囑家人加以包沒，無奈身大腹小，不能並容，一手竟伸腹外，如此經過一日一夜，毒乃盡去。三日後，了無異狀，祇在牛腹外的一隻手，餘毒未淸，筋裕驟縮，五指內屈，不能復伸而已。</p>
<p>麻瘋症是一種最最可怕的疾害，粤劇方面，也有加以描述的，現在粤伶廖俠懐演這種諷刺性的戲劇，最稱首本，劇名「本地狀元」（廣東人稱傳染到麻瘋病謂中了本地狀元），對於這種人生的刻劃，淋漓盡致。</p>
<p>〔編者按：以上關於麻瘋的種種說法，多係鄉間傳聞，是否符合醫理，有待門內人之研究。〕</p>
<h3>時疫醫院人滿為患，霍亂病人到何處去？　　三百七十萬市民，只有一百卅五萬人打過針。</h3>
<p>— 白軍</p>
<p>當霍亂菌猛襲上海的今日，全市所有的時疫醫院，都滿住着病人，沒有一間空餘的病房，也沒有一張空餘的病牀；每天川流不息的有大批病人要住院，而無處收容，只能經注射救命針後，再抬回家。這實是當前上海最大的危機！</p>
<p>根據十四日防疫委員會的公吿，霍亂患者連前共一八九二人；死者一三三人。起使對這大批正在患病的人，依然無法收容，我想霍亂蔓延將更會擴大，死亡數字也將更多。現在，已注射的人是一百卅五萬，而上海的人口是三百七十餘萬，還有二百三十五萬人，將如何火速展開注射工作？而另一方面如何增加時疫醫院的容納量？實是當前急務！</p>
<p>這裏，我將貢獻幾點小小的意見：</p>
<p>（一）增加防疫工作小組。目前有二十隊最好再增加十隊或二十隊。</p>
<p>（二）强迫注射。凡是要乘火車，汽車，電車，輪船，飛機，及進入電影院，戲院，舞廳，咖啡館等公共塲所者，一律要憑防疫注射證。</p>
<p>（三）市郊需密佈工作隊注射下層階級貧民。</p>
<p>這些事情，說來大家都知道，但做起來却只有天曉得！就說防疫證吧，就有不少是隨便開發的，取證者並未打過針。所以許多辦法的實行，還是要當局者嚴格執行，老百姓自己欺騙自己的性命！</p>
<h3>步步高陞節節退步</h3>
<p>— 辛耘</p>
<p>你只要仔細觀察，就能發現以下的情形：在小學內，學期結束時，第一，二，三，三名，差不多大多數是女生。再到初中內，那麽第一，二，三，三名，大多數已爲男生佔有，而女生却在四五名之後，再到高中內一看，更不對了，女生的名次常在倒數的第幾名內。當然，高初中內考第一名的女生也很多，不過，以上情形是很普遍的。爲了什麽原因會如此呢？答案自己去做吧！</p>

<h3>Restoration of Traffic on the Yangtai Highway; National Army Advances Beyond Hai'an; Recovery of Lingbi and Xiaoxian on the Outskirts of Xuzhou</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Zhenjiang Office, 5th] According to an urgent telegram from Taixian, our National Army entered Hai'an on the 24th (120 *li* east of Taixian), and is advancing towards Fu'an on the 25th. The National Army in Qintong is also advancing along the waterways towards Shiyan, hoping to join forces in Dongtai. The National Army's advance beyond Hai'an is like entering an unpopulated area, and the capture of Dongtai County is imminent. Furthermore, after the Communist army's attack on Liuhe on the western front was thwarted, they fled towards Tianchang. Our National Army took advantage of the victory and pursued them in separate routes, like a hot knife through butter. The vanguard troops have retreated near Jiang Gaojiayan (over 30 English miles from Huaiyin). The Communist army inside Huaiyin City is preparing to withdraw.</p>
<p>[Report from Our Nanjing Office, 25th] Over 20,000 Communist troops, aboard 500 civilian boats towed by motorboats, traveled south along the canal from Huaiyin. Yesterday, they urgently advanced through Baoying towards Gaoyou, preparing to reinforce the offensive around Yangzhou and Liuhe. Furthermore, over 20,000 Communist troops reinforcing the offensive against Liuhe from Tianchang and Xuyi have not yet appeared on the front lines as of now.</p>
<p>[Report from Our Zhenjiang Office, 25th] According to a military spokesperson, the outskirts of Yangzhou are still surrounded by the Communist army. Our National Army has consistently adopted a defensive posture, awaiting developments on the Tianchang and Taixing fronts. However, the National Army on the Tianchang front has advanced to the suburbs, but progress has been hindered by the Communist army's main force.</p>
<p>[Report from Our Zhenjiang Office, 25th] The situation in northern Jiangsu is becoming clearer. According to an urgent telegram from Yangzhou, the Communist army on the Yangtai Highway was completely cleared by the National Army this morning. The damaged Guangfu Bridge has been repaired with the cooperation of the National Army and local residents, and telecommunications between Yangzhou and Taixian have returned to normal. Furthermore, at 2:00 PM today, two unidentified aircraft of unknown nationality were spotted in the southwest sky over Xiannvzhen, and machine-gun fire was directed at the ground, killing eight farmers and injuring an unknown number. It is also reported that a contingent of the Communist army from Tianchang infiltrated Dazaishi in Renhe Town last night at 12:00 AM, with unclear intentions.</p>
<p>[Report from Our Nanjing Office, 25th] Lingbi County, a Communist army stronghold south of Xuzhou, was recovered by the National Army last night. Tianchang is also expected to be recovered within days.</p>
<p>[Report from Our Nanjing Office, 25th] Reliable sources confirm that the Communist army's offensive from Supingshan, Sui, and Yongcheng, attempting to threaten Xuzhou, has been blocked on all fronts and is gradually collapsing. As of now, the outskirts of Xuzhou are impregnable.</p>
<p>[Report from Our Jiang Office, 25th] Military sources report that after the National Army in Xuzhou was forced to engage in battle, they defeated the Communist army on all sides of the outskirts of Xuzhou. The Communist army dispersed into smaller units and fled along remote mountain paths. The National Army in Xuzhou is advancing steadily along the coast and has recovered Xinan Town in one fell swoop. The western forces have recovered Xiaoxian.</p>
<p>[Report from Our Toujiang Office, 25th] Military sources report that the Communist army in northern Jiangsu, northern Anhui, and southern Shandong recently advanced towards Xuzhou. The garrison troops in the outposts around Xuzhou met and attacked the invading forces. According to reports, after several days of intense fighting, the Communist army invading from Xiaoxian in the west and the Communist army invading from Xinan Town in the east were bravely repelled by the National Army.</p>
<h3>No Result in Mediating the Central Plains War; Group Returned to Xi'an Yesterday; Communist Army in Fang County Fleeing Towards Zhushan</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Hankou Office, 25th] Military sources: (A) The main force of the Communist army under Li Xiannian is still entrenched near Fengjiadian, northeast of Manchuanguan (the border between Shaanxi and Hubei), continuously launching offensives, attempting to invade the National Army's defense zone, and has not shown any sign of accepting mediation by the peace envoys. (B) On the 22nd, a remnant of the Communist army, numbering 3,000 to 4,000, fled west to Zhushan County, and there are signs of them heading north to Baihe County on the Shaanxi border to join forces with Li Xiannian. (C) The Communist army that disturbed Fang County has been completely driven out by the Self-Defense Forces after the 21st and has fled towards Zhushan. Local order has been restored, and the displaced civilians are returning home to resume their livelihoods. However, many young men were conscripted by the Communist army, and there is widespread mourning. The government is handling the aftermath.</p>
<p>[Report from Our Beiping Office, 25th] A certain military figure stated: Of the 60,000 Communist troops in the "Central Plains Military Region," after the ongoing major battle, only 5,000 to 6,000 remain capable of combat. The rest have mostly dispersed.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xi'an, 25th] The group of thirty-two arrived here by car at 3:20 PM this afternoon. The group had requested a meeting with Communist army leader Li Xiannian at Nengjuzhai, but was unable to make contact, resulting in the temporary suspension of the group's mediation efforts.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Hankou, 25th] Since the 14th, the Ninth Group, stationed in Laohekou to conduct mediation work, has dropped letters by airplane four times, inviting Li Xiannian to send representatives to Laohekou, Xichuan, and Longjuzhai for negotiations, but has received no response. The peace efforts of the past half-month have yielded no results. Xue Zizheng, the Communist representative sent by the Ninth Group to Hankou for liaison, and Wang Zhenlv, the government representative, flew to Laohekou this morning to join General Lu Jishi, the government group leader, and Colonel He Zhujian, the American group leader. They will fly to Xi'an tomorrow, and the thirty-two-member group will depart from Longjuzhai to Xi'an at the same time and then fly to Beiping to consult with the Military Mediation Department.</p>
<h3>Chief of Staff of the Hankou Garrison Headquarters Refutes Communist Party Statement</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Dankou Office, 25th] Deng Dingyuan, Chief of Staff of the Wuhan Garrison Headquarters, recently refuted the distorted statement made by Zheng Shaowen, the Communist Party representative stationed in Hankou, in Beijing on the 11th of this month, based on the facts: (A) Zheng Shaowen claimed that the "310" Southern Military Region had been largely occupied by the National Army after over a month of fierce fighting under the National Army's major offensive since mid-May. In reality, there was no fighting in Hubei and Henan before June 25th. His fabrication is truly laughable. (B) He said, "The purpose of this major battle was to capture Yihuadian and annihilate the main force of the Communist army." Let us ask, what is the strength of the Communist Party's Central Plains Military Region? Is the area occupied by the Communist army a natural fortress? If, as the Communist side claims, the National Army surrounded the Communist army and launched a planned attack, the result would inevitably be a major blow, and it would not be difficult to defeat them. Why would they be allowed to flee west across the road and cause trouble everywhere? (C) He also claimed that "Popi River and Husa in the east were successively captured by the 72nd and 47th Armies of the National Army on the 27th," which is even more absurd. Two orders from the 6th Regiment of the 2nd Brigade of the 1st Column of the Communist army, recovered by our front-line troops, prove that the column began its operation at 19:00 on the 21st, and that the 6th Regiment was originally stationed near Hefan, south of Guangshan and east of Popi River. The fact that the Communist army began its operation on the 21st proves that it had been six days from the 21st to the 27th. The National Army only opened Popi River at the request of the people six days later, which further shows that the facts have been reversed and the claim is self-defeating. When Mr. Deng spoke, he showed the two orders from the Communist army. After the reporters read them in detail, it became even clearer that the Communist army's propaganda was indeed unfounded.</p>
<h3>Snow Flies in the Eighth Month of the Lunar Calendar in the North; Soldiers in the Northeast Prepare Winter Clothing</h3>

<h3>Captured American Soldiers in North China Returned to Camp After Release</h3>

After negotiations by the Military Mediation Department group, they were released south of Changli at around 4:00 PM yesterday. The seven American soldiers have returned to the headquarters of the 7th Regiment of the US military in Beidaihe.</p>
<h3>Communist Army Abducts Judge from Taixian; Local Court Requests Assistance in Rescuing Him</h3>

<h3>Yu Dawei Talks About 600 Kilometers of Railway Traffic Awaiting Repair; Passenger Trains Resume Service on Five Lines in the Northeast</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Nanjing Office, 25th] Before the implementation of the traffic restoration agreement, our reporter visited Minister of Communications Yu Dawei today. Mr. Yu said: I have been in office for less than two months, and I am studying various traffic problems separately and listening to reports from various units. Currently, the important thing to discuss about traffic problems is still to obtain a solution to political and military problems, that is, to reach a settlement in the negotiations between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party. In addition to doing everything possible to restore the work that has been destroyed, the ministry does not want to formulate any new plans. Currently, the rectification and improvement of transportation is truly a complex matter, and whether it is railway, highway, aviation, or water transport, everything needs to be reorganized. It is also reported that the most urgent repairs are needed for a total of 600 kilometers of railways nationwide. The Communist army has wreaked havoc, cutting each section of the destroyed steel rails into several pieces, making them impossible to reuse. Among the various materials that the United States is helping China with, transportation tools and equipment account for very few, and they often cannot be used immediately due to incomplete accessories, which is the biggest and most painful difficulty at present. It is also learned that the most severely damaged railway is the eastern section of the Longhai Railway, where more than 70 kilometers have been completely destroyed, and all sleepers and equipment have disappeared. Although the Yuehan Railway has been barely opened to traffic, various facilities are lacking and it is difficult to maintain. From this conversation, the reporter learned that the restoration of transportation is 100% dependent on the solution of political problems.</p>
<p>[United Press, Beiping, 25th] Local transportation authorities announced today that five lines of the Northeast Railway within the government-controlled area, including Beining, Jichang, and Shenchang, have resumed passenger train service.</p>

<h3>Commander of the Yunnan Provincial Garrison Headquarters, Huo Kuizhang, Summoned to Guling; Presented a Report on the Kunming Incident to the Chairman; Berry Issues a Statement Refuting Zhou Enlai's Remarks</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Kuling Office, 25th] Huo Kuizhang, Commander of the Yunnan Provincial Garrison Headquarters, was summoned and arrived in on the 23rd, leaving Kunming. He went up the mountain yesterday morning and presented a report on the Kunming incident to the Chairman at 9:00 AM today.</p>
<p>[Report from Our Nanjing Office, 25th] Luo Longji, Liang Shuming, and Zhang Shenfu, representatives of the Democratic League, visited Shao Lizi, the government representative of the Political Consultative Conference this morning, to make requests regarding the assassination of Li and Wen. (1) The government, the Democratic League, and the United States should each send one person to form a three-person investigation committee to conduct on-site investigations in Kunming; (2) The perpetrators of the case should be publicly tried.</p>
<p>It is reported that the government is still considering these requests. It is heard that if the Democratic League sends someone to Kunming to investigate the Li and Wen case, the likely candidate would be Liang Shuming.</p>
<p>[City News] Colonel Berry, Deputy Director of the Sino-American Cooperative Organization, issued the following statement regarding Zhou Enlai's remarks: Recently, the Shanghai newspaper intercepted General Zhou Enlai's remarks stating that the Sino-American Cooperative Organization had transferred silent pistols to the secret police of the Chinese government. This statement is completely unfounded. During the three years I served as Chief of Staff of the Sino-American Cooperative Organization, Group Leader of the US Navy in China, and Deputy Director of the Sino-American Cooperative Organization, I never handled the receipt of such weapons, so there was no way to transfer them to any department of the Chinese government. Furthermore, a detailed inspection of the entire list of American materials obtained by the Sino-American Cooperative Organization revealed that no silent weapons were transferred by the US Navy in China. The various weapons of the Sino-American Cooperative Organization were all normal weapons, and their use was completely limited to attacking the Japanese army. The past war achievements of the Sino-American Cooperative Organization fully prove that these weapons did indeed exert their greatest effectiveness within the above-mentioned scope of use.</p>

<h3>Three-Person Meeting to Be Held Soon; Zhou Enlai Flew Back to Beijing from Shanghai Yesterday; Met with General Marshall This Morning to Exchange Views</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Office, 25th] Regarding the news that Chairman Fu had a trip back to Beijing, our reporter learned that the Chairman will not return to Beijing in the short term.</p>
<p>[Report from Our Nanjing Office, 25th] It is learned that the possibility of moving the location of the Kuomintang-Communist negotiations to Lushan is very small, because the Communist Party insists that it will never go up the mountain. At the same time, the government representatives participating in the negotiations have not left Beijing. Now that Zhou Enlai has returned to Beijing, the reporter visited a government representative, who said that the three-person meeting may be held soon.</p>
<p>[Report from Our Nanjing Office, 25th] Zhou Enlai and Deng Yingchao flew to Beijing at 5:00 PM on the 25th. Mr. Zhou originally planned to visit General Marshall tonight, but because he felt very depressed about the recent passing of Tao Xingzhi, he changed the arrangement to meet with General Marshall at 10:00 AM on the 26th to exchange views on various issues of the Kuomintang-Communist negotiations. Mr. Zhou has achieved results and reached an agreement on the two matters of relief for the "Liberated Areas" and the closure of the Yellow River in Shanghai. The content will be released soon.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Nanjing, 25th] An American official here said: Chinese Communist representative Zhou Enlai returned to Beijing this afternoon. As soon as Mr. Zhou returns here, the two American mediators, Special Envoy Marshall and Ambassador Stuart Leighton, will be able to discover whether there is still a possibility of a peaceful resolution to the current dispute. The two have recently met with Chairman Chiang in Guling to listen to the government's full views, and now they are eager to hold negotiations with Mr. Zhou within the scope of these views. However, it is still too early to finalize any concrete plan at this time, because even if peace talks resume, everything will have to start from scratch.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 25th] The London Times editorial today reviewed the China issue, stating: China's greatest hope lies in the people's desire for peace. This matter can be judged to what extent in the coming months. In short, only the Chinese people can decide the fate of China at present.</p>

Xinxian is currently under attack by the Communist army. It is reported that the Communist army has been discovered near Huangzhai, 60 *li* from Taiyuan. The Communist army besieging Taiyuan comes from three sides: Nie Rongzhen's troops from the Jin-Cha-Ji border region, He Long's troops from northwestern Shanxi, and the 379th Brigade (originally belonging to Wang Zhen) from northern Shaanxi. The Communist army seems to want to capture Taiyuan first, and then attack Datong.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 25th] Lin Biao's representative, Li Minran (also known as Li Lisan), accompanied by Cai Zong, arrived in Shenyang by air from Changchun at 3:00 PM today to pay respects to Chief Executive Du.</p>
<p>[United Press, Shenyang, 25th] Lin Biao's representative, Li Minran, flew here from Changchun at 3:00 PM this afternoon, apparently intending to meet with Xiong Shihui and Du Yuming for discussions. According to Li's remarks to the press, the prospects for peace are bright, and the Chinese Communists will not violate their promises. If local negotiations can proceed smoothly, it will greatly benefit the Nanjing negotiations. Li plans to stay here for two or three days.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Shenyang, 24th] Li Minran is scheduled to fly to Shenyang on the 25th as Lin Biao's representative to visit military authorities. It is rumored that Rao Shushi will be appointed as the political commissar of the New Fourth Army, and Li Minran will serve as the Chinese Communist representative to the Executive Headquarters' Forward Division in Changchun.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Changchun, 24th] Liao Yaoxiang and Shang Chuan jointly hosted a banquet for Li Minran and Zheng Dongguo at the Railway Hotel last night. Li Minran and Colonel Tyson (representative of Dai Boermen) all expressed their sincere hope for peace. Li Minran further believes that peace in the Northeast will help the negotiations in Nanjing and the peace of the whole country.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 25th] The situation in the Northeast is becoming tense again. The buffer zone along the Songhua River line has not been delineated, and the Communist army is massively concentrated on the north bank, preparing to cross the river and launch an offensive along the northern section of the China Changchun Railway. Other Communists also say that there will be a major war in the Northeast.</p>
<p>[United Press, Beiping, 25th] The "Xin Sheng Bao," which is close to General Du Yuming, reported today that after many long meetings between the government, Communist Party, and U.S. representatives in the Executive Headquarters' Forward Team in Changchun, an agreement has been reached regarding the neutral zones in the Northeast: no war shall occur, and no troops shall be stationed. However, the government's administrative personnel will not be prevented from taking over. It is said that the detailed rules of the agreement have been agreed upon by all parties and will be announced soon.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 24th] Northeast news: (1) The buffer zone north of the Songhua River is still being negotiated for establishment. It is reported that the government insists that the Communist army withdraw from Taolaizhao and retreat another two miles, while the Communist Party insists that the National army retreat to the south bank of the Songhua River. The dispute has not yet been resolved. When the Red House was captured by the Communist army and the National army was preparing to counterattack, the group arrived to mediate, thus avoiding a war. However, this issue remains unresolved. (2) Representatives of the U.S. and Communist Party from the Thirtieth Executive Team left Shenyang yesterday for Benxi and then Anshan to continue their investigation. (3) The work of the Northeast Executive Headquarters Division is becoming increasingly weak and ineffective. After Dai Boermen's suggestion for a Du-Lin meeting failed, he quietly returned to Beiping yesterday. Rao Shushi is still滞留in Yan'an and has not returned. If the situation cannot be greatly improved, the Changchun Executive Headquarters Division will become an empty institution.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Beiping, 24th] U.S. Representative Major General Dale Boermen of the Executive Headquarters Changchun Division came to Beiping from Changchun to report on the situation in the Northeast to the Executive Headquarters authorities.</p>
<p>Li Lisan Discusses the Meaning of His Changed Name</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Changchun, 24th] Deputy Chief Executive Zheng Dongguo visited Li Minran (Lisan) on the 23rd, and their conversation mainly revolved around memories of past events. Zheng talked about India, and Li talked about France, which was quite pleasant. Li once told people that his departure from the old name "Lisan" indicates that the name and the "Lisan Line" belong to the past. His use of "Minran" symbolizes that his views and opinions are completely different from the past.</p>
<p>[United Press, Harbin, 25th] Li Minran, a mysterious figure in the Northeast, has returned to the Chinese Communist Party after sixteen years of exile. A United Press reporter met him at the Communist Party hotel, which was recently the residence of Malinovsky, and sat down to talk with him. When asked why he returned to China, Li replied: "I was re-elected as a Central Committee member by the Communist Party Congress in April last year. It was not until August last year, when Guo Moruo was in Moscow, that I found out about it, and of course, I was eager to return to China." Li visited Mao Zedong in Yan'an three weeks ago, which was his first time in eighteen years. Li is currently the Director of Foreign Affairs and Advisor of the Chinese Communist Party's branch in the Northeast Executive Headquarters. In reality, he is a behind-the-scenes figure of the Chinese Communist Party, and his power in the Northeast is quite large, not less than that of Lin Biao. Li is currently forty-six years old.</p>

<h3>Negotiations Underway Between China and the Soviet Union Regarding the Removal of Industrial Equipment from the Northeast; Chinese Embassy Claims Sino-American Commercial Treaty Will Soon Be Completed</h3>

Therefore, they are very grateful for the U.S. military in China. 'I do not understand what those who demand the withdrawal of U.S. troops from China intend.'" Ambassador Gu refuted rumors that Special Envoy Marshall had failed in his mission to unify China, saying, "I do not believe that Marshall's mission has failed." He also denied that there is a civil war in China, saying, "Although there are conflicts everywhere, there is no civil war in the true sense of the word." As for the Sino-American commercial treaty, "Progress is being made, and it is expected to be completed rapidly within a few weeks."</p>

<h3>The Executive Yuan Announces the Truth About the Sugar Price Issue</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 25th] President Song of the Executive Yuan previously stated that some members of society had questioned the increase in sugar prices in Shanghai after the establishment of the Taiwan Sugar Corporation. At a press conference, he promised that after returning to Nanjing, he would order the relevant authorities to conduct a thorough investigation into the truth and discuss normal handling methods for publication. After President Zhu returned to Nanjing, he immediately ordered Minister of Economic Affairs Wang Wenhua, Minister of Agriculture and Forestry Zhou Yichun, and Chairman of the Resources Commission Qian Changzhao to jointly investigate, discuss, and submit a report to the Executive Yuan. The Executive Yuan has now published the situation in accordance with the report:</p>
<p>(1) The Establishment of Taiwan Sugar Corporation and Past Sugar Sales</p>
<p>Before the Japanese surrender, the Taiwan sugar industry was operated by four Japanese companies: Japan Sugar, Taiwan, Meiji, and Qiaoshui Port. It had jurisdiction over 42 sugar factories, 2 million mu of sugarcane fields, and 2,000 kilometers of railways, with a capital of 300 million Japanese yen. It was the largest industry in Taiwan. After the outbreak of the Pacific War, the Japanese, due to a shortage of rice, converted most of the sugarcane fields in Taiwan to grow food. In addition, the Allied bombing of sugar factory facilities caused great damage. Therefore, before the armistice, Taiwan's sugar production had fallen to 300,000 tons per year. In October of that year, after government personnel arrived in Taiwan, the Sugar Industry Supervision Committee was established on December 1. In April of this year, it was handed over to the Sugar Industry Takeover Committee. The sugarcane planting season is from July to September each year, while the sugar production season is from January to April. It takes 18 months from the time sugarcane is planted to the time it is harvested. Therefore, the sugarcane planted this year will not be available for sugar production until the beginning of next year. Last year, when the surrender occurred, the sugarcane planting season had already passed, and at that time, due to the severe shortage in Japan, the number of sugarcane planted was limited. From January to April of this year, 86,000 tons of sugar were produced using the existing sugarcane. From January to April of next year, due to the impact of insufficient planting last year, production is feared to decrease sharply to 30,000 to 40,000 tons. The production in the year after that will depend on the quantity of sugarcane planted this year. The Resources Commission took over the Taiwan sugar industry in April of this year, when it was ordered to handle it. It was approved to jointly operate it with the Taiwan Administrative Governor's Office. Because a small portion of Taiwanese compatriots invested in it, the Taiwan Sugar Corporation was established to operate it. It was formally established on May 1. The Resources Commission hired American experts to go to Taiwan for on-site inspection and to assist the company in formulating a recovery plan. The preliminary report from the American experts has now been sent, estimating that the supplementary repair equipment will require US$30 million, to be used over three years, with approximately US$10 million in the first year. After the completion of this recovery plan, it can produce 1 million tons of sugar annually, which is sufficient to meet the needs of the entire country and more. If each ton is calculated at US$100, it can save US$100 million in foreign exchange annually. In summary, the scale of Taiwan Sugar is grand, and the undertakings it engages in include not only sugar production but also railways and farmland. The restoration funds are considerable, and a large amount of foreign exchange can be saved in the future. It should be managed by the government in a unified manner. (To be continued)</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The Education System Urgently Needs Reform</h3>
<p>The last academic year has ended, and the next is about to begin. Education is the lifeblood of nation-building, revolving year after year, continuing forward, to cultivate the nation's new generation. However, the current Chinese education system, in terms of its merits and demerits for the nation, is truly worthy of examination.</p>
<p>The content of China's new education emphasizes the equal importance of moral, intellectual, and physical education. Judging from the implementation over the past thirty to forty years, strictly speaking, failures outweigh successes. First, let's talk about physical education. To make the race healthy and transform physiques, there are originally many conditions. The public's educational level, economic capacity, and various social systems related to national health, such as the promotion of health services, restrictions on marriages of disabled men and women, improvements in dietary methods and dietary ingredients, are all closely related to the progress or decline of the general public's health. All responsibility cannot be attributed to the education sector alone. However, as far as the education sector is concerned, the promotion of physical education in the new education over the past thirty to forty years has been extremely narrow. The manifestation of physical education is limited to the holding of sports meets and ball games, and there is little achievement in the general sense of health preservation and recuperation in physical education. As for moral education, it is even more nominal. The training of character must pass through practical life to have a lasting and fixed influence. Currently, although schools at all levels have courses such as civic morality, in reality, the moral education itself has completely fallen into the trap of bookishness, in one ear and out the other, with no effect at all. The political chaos, the prevalence of corruption, the deterioration of morality, and the decline of morale in all these years are sufficient to illustrate the complete failure of China's new education in moral education in the past. The only focus of China's new education in the past seems to have been entirely on intellectual education. Intellectual education originally includes thought and knowledge, but thought and knowledge are obviously not just activities in the classroom, and have never left the classroom and separated from books. We analyze China's current education system, from elementary school to university, and it is all about how many points are required to pass, how many courses are required to pass to be promoted, and how many years are required to graduate. The recruitment of students is mainly based on written examinations, and those who fail due to oral examinations are rarely seen; the hiring of teachers only asks about resumes, not character. Classes begin and end, schools open and close, and vacations begin and end, this is the form of China's "education," and this is the content of China's education. Today, China's entire education is just a kind of "bookish" education, and there is almost nothing else besides "books"!</p>
<p>The greatest purpose and task of education is to cultivate character and train people to be human. The transmission of knowledge is certainly important, but the training of morality is especially important. Character is the land, knowledge is the building; if the land is not solid, the construction of high-rise buildings is all a waste of effort. We all have children now. If we study carefully, sending a child to school, from elementary school to university, where will he get scientific training? How can he develop a modern mind? If the mind is not modernized and scientificized, he will inevitably lack rationality, his thoughts will be confused, and he will be unorganized and inefficient in his work. If we further hope that he will have lofty ideals, great ambitions, and amazing inventions, it is like climbing a tree to catch a fish! If we look at the leaders in various fields today, which one has not been baptized by the new education? However, the country is getting worse day by day, and society is becoming more chaotic day by day. If we think about the cause and effect of this, we have already thought about half of it. Now, the means of corruption in society are becoming more and more sophisticated, the ability to quibble is becoming more and more advanced, and the decline of morality is becoming more and more serious. Education that does not emphasize character training but only holds a few books will inevitably train selfish, deceitful, narrow-minded, and tyrannical people, and selfishness, deceitfulness, narrow-mindedness, and tyranny are all sufficient to undermine social stability and hinder national progress. Now China's education, this year follows the same pattern as last year, next year follows the same pattern as this year, year after year, always copying like this, it can be said to be wasting the country's public funds, misleading the youth's time, and ruining the nation's seeds!</p>
<p>We have chatted with friends who are in charge of university administration, and they are all worried about the pathological state of today's education system and feel infinite pain. However, the reform of the entire education system cannot be achieved by the shouts of a few people, nor can it be promoted by newspapers that occasionally mention this issue. Today, those who bear the responsibility for national education administration should make a great determination to first focus on and study this issue with all their strength; the gentlemen and ladies who are in a leading position in the education and culture circles are naturally duty-bound to come out and discuss this issue, so as to lay the foundation for reform. Education is the foundation of nation-building. We believe that China's current education system urgently needs a comprehensive review and reform, so as to enrich the nation's life and create the nation's future, and it is absolutely impossible to continue in this way year after year.</p>

<h3>Yesterday's Test Detonated a Shallow-Water Atomic Bomb, Stirring Up a Steam Column 9,000 Feet High, Two Target Ships at the Center Were Hit and Sunk One After Another</h3>
<p>[United Press International, Bikini, 25th] The results of today's shallow-water atomic bomb explosion are as follows:</p>
<p>[Ships Sunk] The battleship Arkansas, the aircraft carrier Saratoga, a sailing ship, a tank landing craft, and a medium landing craft attached to the atomic bomb. [Ships Damaged and Leaning in the Water] The battleship New York and Nagato, the aircraft carrier Independence, the cruiser Pensacola, the destroyer Hughes, and the transport ship Fallon. [Ships Damaged at the Bottom of the Lake, Unclear] Five submarines submerged during the test.</p>
<p>[United Press International, Flagship USS McKinley, 25th] Atomic Bomb Test Commander Blandy announced today: "Six or eight submarines were originally parked underwater to test the power of the atomic bomb. We do not know if they have been sunk. None of them have surfaced. From the air, two are still parked underwater in their original positions. There is still radiation near the target ships in the lagoon, so it is impossible to immediately determine the extent of the damage to the warships. There are no casualties." Blandy then reported on the water column stirred up by the atomic bomb, saying: The water column was about 5,000 feet high, and the gas and water vapor column was as high as 9,000 feet. The diameter of the bottom of the water column was 2,100 feet, and the diameter of the top of the column was even larger. The giant waves stirred up quickly dissipated, and when they hit the shore of Bikini Lagoon, they were only 7 to 10 feet high. The ships parked outside the lagoon were not affected by the waves, radiation, or underwater impact.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Near Bikini Atoll, 25th] According to official announcements: As a result of the shallow-water atomic bomb explosion in Bikini Lagoon, the target battleship "Arkansas" sank, and a steel-hulled oil tanker and a landing craft also sank to the bottom of the sea. Four submarines were parked underwater during the test, and two more were parked on the surface. According to aircraft reports, a submarine has been found underwater. The ships parked east of the center of the explosion do not appear to have been damaged; the aquatic plants at the bottom of the lagoon were torn apart by the bomb, and the surface of the water is a deep blue color. The authorities are now trying to collect samples of seawater containing radio radiation. However, it will not be possible to approach the area near the sunken "Arkansas" for several days. It is believed that the ship sank in about 15 minutes, because the smoke and fog over the lagoon disappeared in 15 minutes.</p>
<h3>The Scene After the Explosion in a Flash</h3>
<p>[Reuters, San Francisco, 24th] The electricity from Bikini has just started pouring in. Within five minutes after the fifth atomic bomb exploded, seawater sprayed to a height of about 5,000 feet, followed by steam droplets spraying to a height of 4,000 feet. The diameter of the sea surface where the seawater rose is estimated to be about 2,136 feet, and the higher the water column, the thinner it seems to be. Within two minutes after the explosion, all target ships, except for a few on the periphery, were shrouded in water vapor and could no longer be seen. Ten minutes later, the water vapor had not yet dissipated, but at the same time, waves about five feet high were seen hitting the coral shore of the island. Thirteen minutes later, 16 target ships could be seen, and half an hour later, it could be determined that the 29,000-ton battleship Nevada, the Japanese battleship Nagato, and the 11,000-ton cruiser Independence were still on the surface. Before the experiment, the radio report said that Lieutenant General Blandy had announced a half-hour postponement of the atomic bomb explosion, and at 3:30, the USS McKinley announced that the atomic bomb had been detonated five minutes later than the scheduled explosion time using a radio button. An officer on the ship reported the time to the explosion. When the report reached only one second left, a loud bang was heard, and at the same time, seawater surged up into a column that became thinner towards the tip. Ten minutes after the explosion, Lieutenant General Blandy announced on the flagship that the atomic bomb had exploded at 8:35 Bikini time. When the clouds gradually disappeared, the 26,100-ton battleship Arkansas had disappeared and had sunk. The stern of the aircraft carrier Saratoga was submerged in the water, and the battleship New York also appeared to be damaged. The palm trees on Bikini Island seemed to be broken. Blandy was able to announce preliminary results within two or three hours after the explosion.</p>
<p>Target Ships on the Lake Surface Rocked Like Toys</p>
<p>[United Press International, B-29 "Bikini Voice" aircraft, 24th] The world's fifth atomic bomb exploded underwater in Bikini Lagoon, and the battleships on the lake surface rocked like toys, but the force of the atomic explosion did not sink most of the battleships arranged in the target area. When the giant bomb exploded, the lagoon was stirred into a sea of fireworks. The waves in the middle of the lagoon surged with the explosion, but did not roll over Bikini Island. The seawater initially rolled up a giant peak, dark brown, and rushed straight into the sky, followed by a second phenomenon of underwater explosion. Suddenly, from the surging water surface, a huge domed column of smoke and water erupted, with a black and brown bottom, disturbed and boiling. The central ring of steam quickly dissipated in the sunlight. All phenomena were fleeting and disappeared in an instant. A piece of steam immediately rose on the sea surface, covering the fleet, like white wool covering it, obstructing the line of sight. The center of the lagoon was an unusual blue color, proving that the atomic bomb had destroyed the lakebed. A glance at the fleet from the air proved that although most of the battleships had not sunk, they had been thrown out of their original positions by the explosion force, and the bottoms of the ships were almost damaged.</p>
<p>Palm Trees on Bikini Island Were Swept Away in an Instant</p>
<p>[United Press International, Bikini, 24th] The world's first underwater atomic bomb exploded at 9:35 tonight (Greenwich Mean Time) in Bikini. The sound was very loud, and the water column was as high as a mile. However, when the smoke dissipated, at least 16 ships were still floating on the surface. The sound of the explosion was so loud that it could be heard clearly by radio listeners as far away as San Francisco. According to official observers, this water mist is very different from that stirred up by the atomic bomb exploding in the air. This wave of spray shot into the sky as high as 8,000 feet. A cloud hung over the blue sky of Bikini, obscuring the view of the air observers. The palm trees on Bikini Atoll, although unharmed during the bombing in the morning of July 1, have now been completely destroyed. Scientists originally predicted that it would stir up 100-foot giant waves, which obviously did not materialize. United Press International reporter Whitehead, representing the American press, observed on a B-29 over Bikini and telegraphed: "The bizarre force of the world's fifth atomic bomb has burned Bikini Lagoon into a cauldron of flames, smoke, and steam. The fate of the ships parked there is unknown." The water column rose at an alarming rate, and when it reached about a mile above the sky, it spread out into a mushroom shape, and its top formed millions of icicles, which fell on the sea surface one after another.</p>
<p>Drone Aircraft Venture into Dangerous Areas</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, San Francisco, 24th] A large number of aircraft will participate in the second atomic bomb test on the morning of the 25th to observe various phenomena after the explosion. The observation range will be centered on the explosion site, and its radius will be 30 miles, so that 66 aircraft can work at the same time. Within this hypothetical range, it will be divided into four areas to be treated, called "Sugar", "Dog", "East", and "Victor". At that time, the aircraft will fly from sea level to 10,000 meters. Such a large-scale use of aircraft to observe scientific phenomena is unprecedented. Photography and film equipment are installed. Scientific experts will analyze various rays of light, whether visible to the naked eye or not, with a spectroscope. There is also a special team dedicated to observing the impact of radio waves. Some aircraft are equipped with automatic driving equipment, called "Vere," to measure radio activity in the atmosphere. There is also this "Lo Peak" aircraft, which will fly into the danger zone, and its automatic pressure gauge can measure the average force of the explosion.</p>
<h3>Australian Earthquake and Thunderstorm in Kyoto Said to Be Related to the Test</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] San Francisco, 25th Broadcasting: The seismic waves recorded by the seismograph at the Adelaide Observatory in Australia are said to be the result of the atomic bomb explosion on Bikini Island. According to government astronomy expert Dewey Er, the record was most significant sixteen minutes after the explosion, equivalent to a disturbing induced wave. However, the Sydney seismograph, which is 700 miles closer to Bikini Island, did not record any tremors. Also, there was a terrible thunderstorm in Beijing, and some people think it is related to the atomic bomb test on Bi Island.</p>
<p>[United Press International, USS Appalachian in Bikini Lagoon, 25th] The USS Appalachian, a ship for newspaper reporters, entered the lagoon this evening, less than nine hours after the explosion, and is parked in the southern part of the lagoon tonight.</p>
<h3>Wilson Appears in Court to Recount the Tragic Situation of the Nanjing Massacre: Knifing, Gun Stabbing, Burning Alive, Defilement, Japanese Soldiers' Barbarity is Appalling</h3>
<p>[United Press International, Tokyo, 25th] Dr. Wilson of Arcata, California, who practiced medicine in Nanjing, testified in the International Tribunal today that during the Nanjing Massacre, Japanese soldiers knifed, stabbed, and defiled women in every way, and even burned residents alive. He also recounted how Chinese doctors and nurses at a university hospital escaped when Japanese soldiers captured Nanjing on December 13, 1937, and how the Japanese soldiers committed all kinds of atrocities, resulting in the hospital being full of wounded people, how the Japanese soldiers stabbed pedestrians, how they spat on and slapped innocent civilians, and how they repeatedly defiled a large number of residents before massacring them. After more than six weeks, the cruel acts committed by the Japanese soldiers against civilians in Nanjing gradually decreased.</p>
<h3>The Defense Repeatedly Attacked, General Qin Fought Alone</h3>
<p>[Kaizo Sha, Tokyo, 25th] Today was the fourth day that General Qin Dechun testified in the Far East International Tribunal. The defense lawyers of the defendants repeatedly stood up to question him, trying to absolve the Japanese leaders of their responsibilities. General Qin fought alone, extremely hard.</p>
<p>When the defense lawyer Brooks stood up and questioned: Was the July 7th Incident caused by Japan issuing a declaration of war, or by China declaring war? (Answer) The Chinese government has never issued such an order. (Question) The witness stated in his statement that the defendant Matsui said, "Asia is Asia for Asians, and the British and Americans are willing to be expelled from Asia." Regarding the expulsion of British and American forces from Asia, please explain in detail? (Answer) Are the attacks on Manila and Pearl Harbor not the best symbols of expelling British and American forces from Asia? At this point, the president of the court believed that the answer to this matter had been completed and urged the defense lawyer to proceed with the questioning quickly. Brooks actually said, "I want to prove that as a result of Western countries coming to China to expand their commercial power, Japan was forced into a great war." The president of the court then asked Brooks to provide evidence. Brooks asked Qin another question, saying that during the Sino-Japanese conflict, did China file a complaint with the League of Nations or protest to the Japanese government? Can the witness provide information on the protest? (Answer) I am not familiar with the central government's diplomatic negotiations. Regarding Japan's acts of aggression, I have repeatedly reported to the central government. (Question) When did you report to the central government? Just as Qin was about to state the main points of the Zhang Weak Incident report, the president of the court stopped him and said: "If you need to report the content, you can submit it to the Chinese government. Please wait a moment, defense lawyer." The defense lawyer then continued to question, "What was the witness's position during the Lugouqiao Incident? Where did you receive the training of staff officers?" This question was stopped by the president of the court. The president of the court and the defense lawyer suddenly started arguing about the issue of recovering lost land after the Sino-Japanese War of Jiawu. After noon, Brooks continued to question: Before 1937, did President Chiang or other Chinese officials ask Japan for financial assistance? (Answer) No. However, there was once a contact for economic cooperation, but this was also requested by the Japanese side to China. (Question) Did the economic cooperation include military supplies, weapons, ammunition, etc.? (Answer) No. (Question) Before 1937, were there foreign generals who entered the Chinese army and maintained a close relationship with the Chinese army? At this time, the prosecutor stated that the question was irrelevant. The session reopened at 2:30. The president of the court announced, "I hereby report the court's decision that objections to questioning should be limited to major matters from now on." Then, after briefly questioning Qin, he ended the opposition questioning of Qin by the identification people over the past few days. Then, witnesses Robert and Wilson were called to the court to prove the Nanjing Massacre.</p>

<h3>After Returning from the Food and Agriculture Conference: Zou Bingwen Discusses Impressions of Travel in America: The United States Spends 100 Million Gold Yuan Annually to Improve Agriculture, Our Agriculture Should Use Mechanical and Scientific Farming</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Dr. Zou Bingwen (pictured), our agricultural expert, flew to the United States on March 7th to attend the Executive Committee of the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization. He returned to Shanghai on the USS General Gordon a few days ago. Yesterday, a reporter from this newspaper made a special trip to interview him and asked about his impressions of this trip. He said: This stay in the United States lasted about three years. His impressions can be divided into three points: (1) Americans are quite concerned about various affairs in our country. During his stay in the United States, he traveled in various places and had a lot of contact with people in the American agricultural sector. He deeply felt the sincerity of American friendship towards China, but the recent frequent news of disputes in our country inevitably made some Americans feel disappointed. Therefore, he urgently hopes that this unfortunate event can be resolved as soon as possible, so that our country's position in the international community can be improved.</p>
<p>Agricultural Country Actually Suffering from Famine</p>
<p>(2) Our country is an agricultural country, and in theory, it should provide food to other countries instead of relying on food from other countries. But the fact shows that before the war, our country often suffered a famine once every few years, eventually relying on the assistance of countries around the world. After this war, news of famine in our country spread all over the world again, making others feel that our country itself does not pay enough attention to agriculture, resulting in this result. Therefore, he deeply hopes that our country can have a remedy for this past mistake in the future. (3) Among those returning home on the same ship were 465 specialized personnel in agriculture, industry, transportation, and other fields sent by our government to the United States for internships. During the internship process in the United States, he was responsible for presiding over the agricultural personnel. During the return trip, he had group discussions with the trainees on the ship and deeply felt that each member had the ability and vitality. Therefore, he hopes that after returning home, the government and society can use these trainees so that each member can do their best.</p>
<p>When the reporter asked about his thoughts on China's agricultural construction after returning home, he said: I studied agriculture in the United States and deeply felt that the American government is very dedicated to agricultural construction. The American national treasury allocates nearly 100 million U.S. dollars for agricultural expenses every year. Therefore, the improvement of agricultural production, the development of the rural economy, the improvement of farmers' lives, and the popularization of farmers' knowledge can all achieve ideal goals. Not only that, but the U.S. Department of Agriculture also hires a large number of experts to engage in scientific research. The invention of DDT insecticide and penicillin were all invented by experts from the Department of Agriculture. Its benefits to human well-being are not limited to agriculture alone. In contrast, everything in our country feels backward and cannot be compared. The immediate priority is to achieve the following three conditions: (1) National agricultural production is self-sufficient, (2) Increase the income of farmers nationwide, (3) Develop agricultural products to earn foreign exchange.</p>
<p>Use Machinery, Intensify Reclamation</p>
<p>Zou also explained that because China needs industry, the number of farmers has decreased, the unit area of arable land has increased, and cooperative methods need to be used to gradually achieve agricultural mechanization. At the same time, because there is a lot of wasteland in China, especially in the nine northeastern provinces, reclamation needs to be intensified to increase the production area and enrich farmers' incomes. Finally, Zou said: American agricultural production is now surplus, and the arable land per person has increased from 100 to 120 acres. Chinese farmers can only cultivate a few acres per person, and there is a lot of labor waste. We must use machinery and scientific farming methods to increase production and reduce famine.</p>
<p>Short Stay, Will Go to Nanjing Soon</p>
<p>According to reports, Mr. Zou is currently the head of the Chinese delegation of the Sino-American Agricultural Technology Cooperation Group, a senior advisor to the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry and the Ministry of Food, chairman of the Chinese Agricultural Society, and one of the fifteen executive committee members of the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization. The conference held its first founding conference in Quebec, Canada last November. After attending the founding conference, Mr. Zou returned home briefly on December 10th last year. He then flew to the United States again on March 7th this year to participate in the second executive committee meeting held by the conference in the United States. The conference continued to hold its third executive committee meeting in the United States on June 28th and adjourned on July 3rd. Mr. Zou boarded a ship in San Francisco on July 10th to return home. It is reported that the fourth executive committee meeting of the conference will be held in Denmark on August 28th this year. The annual meeting will be held in the same place on September 2nd. Mr. Zou will fly to Denmark to participate at that time. It is rumored that Mr. Zou will stay in Shanghai for a short time and then depart for Nanjing on the 29th of this month.</p>
<h3>Agricultural Organizations Hold Tea Party to Welcome Returning Agricultural Personnel: Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry Will Coordinate Work Allocation</h3>
<p>In order to adapt to the needs of agriculture after the war, the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry selected outstanding technical personnel for internships in the United States last April. These trainees included 12 veterinarians, 9 animal husbandry personnel, 5 fishery personnel, 2 agricultural meteorologists, 18 agricultural economists, 7 agricultural machinery personnel, 7 farmland water conservancy personnel, 14 soil and fertilizer personnel, 2 food processing personnel, 21 agricultural extension personnel, 12 plant disease and insect pest personnel, 37 agronomists, 14 forestry personnel, and 4 soil and water conservation personnel, totaling 166 people. Except for more than 40 trainees in agricultural economics and agricultural extension, whose internships were extended to the beginning of September due to circumstances, the remaining 110 people completed their one-year-plus studies and returned home on the American ship "General Gordon" with Dr. Zou Bingwen, an expert representing our country at the United Nations Agricultural Conference, arriving in Shanghai at 10:00 AM the day before yesterday. At 3:30 PM yesterday afternoon, the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry and other organizations such as the Shanghai Fish Market held a tea party at the Tsinghua Alumni Association to welcome them. More than 100 people including Minister Zhou Yichun, Zou Bingwen, and the trainees attended. Minister Zhou first gave a welcome speech, hoping to contribute to Sino-American agricultural technology cooperation. He also hoped that they could use what they have learned and work hard for their positions to meet the needs of national construction. After Wu Juenong of the Chinese Agricultural Society delivered a speech, Minister Zhou invited Dr. Zou Bingwen to deliver a speech. Finally, Director Zhao Lianfang of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry reported that the trainees who went to the United States for internships, except for those who have already contacted jobs, can register first if they want to be introduced by the ministry. The ministry has now received letters from the Jiangsu Agricultural Improvement Committee, the Guangxi Provincial Government, the Hubei Relief and Relief Sub-Administration, and the Sichuan Agricultural Improvement Institute and other agencies, requesting the supply of talents, and they are very welcome to apply. Mr. Zou Bingwen advocated that in order to fully match people and things, it is best for the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry to coordinate the distribution. Minister Zhou immediately made an appointment with each trainee to talk to the department in batches, and the hosts and guests enjoyed themselves until about 6 o'clock before dispersing.</p>
<h3>Customs Seizes Large Quantities of Nylon Stockings and Cosmetics</h3>
<p>According to a person in charge of customs in this city yesterday, the bureau has heard about the evasion of taxes and smuggling of imported goods. However, according to the results of the investigation, most of the glassware and American food sold on the streets and alleys of the city have already been taxed, so the current smuggling situation is not as serious as rumored outside. According to the round-the-clock efforts of the anti-smuggling team of the customs, it has cracked down on smugglers hundreds of times each month, with a value of more than hundreds of millions of yuan. Recently, it has seized as many as eight smuggling cases of prohibited imported goods such as nylon stockings and cosmetics, with a value of approximately more than 400 million yuan. Most of these smugglers are sailors on American warships, colluding with local traitors, using large sailing boats and sampans when the fleet approaches the Wusongkou to engage in smuggling through exchange. The customs authorities are now making every effort to prevent this despicable smuggling. In order to eliminate smuggling, they are encouraging people to report it as much as possible and give informers a reward of 30% of the total value of the smuggled goods.</p>

<h3>Complicated Drug Trafficking and Fraud Case: Defendant Liu Guanmin's Inside Story – Japanese Attempted to Poison American Soldiers</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Liu Guanmin, a native of Yantai, residing at No. 14, Lane 206, Rue Amiral Bayle (present-day Baike Road), possessed four pounds of morphine hydrochloride and intended to sell it. On March 30th of this year, he went to the home of Japanese man Maekawa Iichiro, asking him to find customers. On April 2nd, Liu, along with Zhu Guobin (residing at No. 8, Lane 1275, Zhongzheng Road), a doctor from Wuxi and his business associate, took a bottle of morphine samples to Maekawa Iichiro. That afternoon, Maekawa Iichiro took the sample to another Japanese man, Hande Yoshio, who then passed it through Japanese men Ida Noboru and Oshima Masao (female) to Chen Qingfeng (residing at No. 42, Zhe Xing Lane, Route D'Esvres). Chen, a Taiwanese, intended to purchase the drugs and traffic them to Taiwan. He then asked his friend Ke Jiajun to contact Oshima Masao on his behalf. Oshima Masao brought the sample to Ke's residence at No. 127, Youheng Road. After examining the goods, Chen and Ke agreed with Oshima on a price of 3 million yuan per pound. On the morning of April 4th, Ida Noboru obtained Liu Guanmin's consent. At around 2 PM that afternoon, Oshima Masao went to Ke's home, collected an advance payment of 1.47 million yuan, and handed it over to Ida Noboru. At this time, Liu Guanmin suddenly changed his mind, believing that the Japanese had no real power in China. He intended to embezzle the advance payment. He colluded with a Norwegian man named Rona, tricking Maekawa and others into a small room in the Flora Cafe on Yuhang Road. After receiving the advance payment of 1.47 million yuan, Rona claimed to be an American military intelligence officer and tricked the Japanese men into leaving. Afterward, Liu received 1.07 million yuan, and Rona received 400,000 yuan. Unexpectedly, the Japanese Ida and others, feeling aggrieved by Liu and Rona's fraud, immediately reported it to the Second Company of the Independent Third Battalion of the Military Police. The military police detained all the suspects and referred the case to the District Procuratorate for public prosecution. At the first public hearing yesterday morning, the defendants hired lawyers Yao Junyu, Shan Yuhua, Shen Ying Shi, and others. All denied the drug trafficking charges. However, according to Liu, in February of this year, during a visit to Zhu Guobin for medical treatment, Zhu told him that a Japanese man named Ota (who has now returned to Japan) wanted to purchase a large quantity of morphine, intending to use Jewish intermediaries to bring it onto American warships, mixing it into the water pipes to poison American soldiers. Liu, feeling indignant, reported it to his friend Rona, an American military intelligence officer. Rona then informed the American military authorities, who then instructed Liu, Zhu, and others to feign cooperation with the Japanese to investigate their conspiracy. Liu admitted to being connected with American military intelligence and denied any intention of fraud. After questioning each defendant in court, the judge, deeming the case complex, ordered them to be remanded to custody separately and adjourned the hearing.</p>

<h3>Zhu Chansheng, Key Suspect in the Rong Case, Escorted to Shanghai; Police Station Interrogated Him All Night; Authorities Will Host Press Conference to Report Progress</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Since Zhu Chansheng, a key suspect in the Rong Desheng kidnapping case, was apprehended in Fuzhou and escorted to Shanghai, Zhang Shishi, Chief of the Criminal Division of the Police Bureau, has personally interrogated him all night. Yesterday, Section Chief Li of the Second Section was dispatched to the Investigation Department of the Garrison Headquarters to study the confessions of the relevant criminals in detail. Therefore, the investigation of Zhu may take another day or two before he can be transferred to the Garrison Headquarters for joint processing. Furthermore, Xuan Tiewu, who is also the Garrison Commander, considering the complexity of the case, has ordered the Criminal Division of the Police Bureau to send personnel to jointly interrogate all the arrested suspects in the case with the Investigation Department. He will host a press conference for the city's media in the near future to report on the progress of the case.</p>
<p>Supplementary Notes on the Investigation Process</p>
<p>[Another Report] The report yesterday did not fully detail the investigation and arrest of Zhu Chansheng, another principal offender in the case. Here are some supplementary notes.</p>
<p>On June 27th, the Changshu Branch reported, based on information from plainclothes police officer Xu Zhengting, that Zhu Chansheng, residing at No. 131, East Siwen Lane, Xinzha Road, had repeatedly committed kidnapping cases in the past. Since the Rong case occurred, Zhu Chansheng's whereabouts have been mysterious. After the Rong case ransom was paid, it was discovered that he was spending lavishly, which was highly suspicious. The Director of the Zhao Branch, Deputy Director Yin, and Section Member Zhang Faxiang began investigating. After discussing with Director Zhang of the Criminal Division, they determined that Zhu Chansheng was highly suspected of being involved in the Rong case. On the morning of the 28th at 2 AM, Section Member Zhang Faxiang, along with police officers Wang Ji, Ding Fanglong, Zhang Huiyu, and Hao Tingjie, went to arrest him at his address. Unexpectedly, Zhu had left two days prior, and his wife had returned to her hometown three days before. They immediately took Zhu Chansheng's mother-in-law, Su Guo, his brother-in-law, Su Xiaolin, and his live-in partner, Fan Jinbao, along with a piece of paper found in the residence, to the station for interrogation. The results of separate interrogations revealed that Su Guo and Su Xiaolin were adamant about not revealing the whereabouts of Zhu Chansheng and his wife. According to Fan Jinbao, he heard that Zhu Chansheng had gone to Fuzhou, but whether that was true could be inquired from Meng A'er (address unknown). As for Zhu's wife, she had taken luggage back to Henglin the day before. Before leaving, she gave me this piece of paper (the paper found) and asked me to call Rong Xianzhang and ask him for 150,000 yuan," and so on. Later, the telephone company confirmed that Meng A'er lived at No. 6, Qingchang Lane, Aerjin Road. The original investigators rushed to arrest him but were unsuccessful. They then went to the Zhenzhong Dyeing and Weaving Factory on Xiaoshadu Road and finally arrested Meng A'er (i.e., Meng Youzhang). He was brought back for questioning and confessed that Zhu Chansheng had indeed taken the Deng Keng ship to Fuzhou on the 26th of this month because the ship's compradore, Shen Bomin, knew Zhu. As for Zhu's whereabouts after arriving in Fuzhou, he said it could be inquired from Shen Bomin. Based on the above clues, Director Zhao of the branch decided on four measures to be implemented simultaneously: (1) The branch immediately telegraphed the Fuzhou City Police Bureau to detain Zhu when the Deng Keng ship arrived at the port. (2) Police officers Zhang Huiyu and Hao Tingjie were immediately dispatched to guard Zhu Chansheng's home. (3) Fan Jinbao was instructed at the station to telegraph Rong Xianzhang to send money to Zhu's home. (4) Deputy Chief Yin led Section Member Zhang Faxiang, Ding Fanglong, Tang Mubin, and others to Henglin overnight to investigate and arrest Zhu's wife. Rong Xianzhang indeed sent money to Zhu Chansheng's home on June 29th and was immediately arrested by the police officers. He confessed, "I owed Zhu Chansheng 150,000 yuan because Feng Zhongjia asked me to seek favor from the old man, so I sent the money after receiving the telegram, there is no other relationship," and so on. Meanwhile, Deputy Chief Yin led officers directly to Zhu Wuda's home (i.e., Zhu Chansheng's younger brother) in Henglin, where they arrested Zhu's wife, Zhu Su, Zhu's younger brother, Zhu Wuda, and Zhu's sister-in-law, Zhu Chen, and found 3,000 US dollars, a diamond ring, and a gold bracelet in her bag. They brought Zhu Su, Zhu Wuda, Zhu Chen, and the seized ornaments back to Shanghai. According to Zhu Su, the US dollars were given to me by Zhu Chansheng when he left, I don't know where they came from." It was found that the funds released in Shanghai included 1 million yuan borrowed by Sun Yuming, the owner of the Datong Barber Shop, on June 23rd, and 500,000 yuan to Sun Rui San, a relative on Huoshan Road, both handled by Zhu Wuda. Later, Sun Yuming was also arrested, and he stated that the loan was given in the form of a check from Yuanchang Qianzhuang. It was later discovered that the drawer of the check was the wanted criminal Yuan Zhongzhu. According to Meng Youzhang's confession and the investigation by China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, it was learned that the compradore of the Deng Keng ship was indeed Shen Bomin. The ship was scheduled to arrive in Shanghai from Fuzhou on July 2nd. Officers were dispatched to Wusong to wait for the ship. Shen Bomin and Meng Weichen were brought to the General Bureau for interrogation and confessed that Zhu Chansheng was currently residing at No. 6, International Hotel, Zhongping Road, Fuzhou. Director Zhang of the Criminal Division immediately telegraphed Captain Yu of the Fuzhou Provincial Water Police Corps to detain him quickly. A team of officers led by Zhang Faxiang who had moved to become a Section Member of the 2nd Division on July 10th, took the Zhoushan ship to Fuzhou and they did not arrive there until the 13th. They learned that Zhu was detained by the Water Police Corps, and they made their demand to them on the 21st and escorted the suspect to Shanghai on the 24th, where he was sent to the transport department.</p>

About 50 people, including responsible persons from the company and reporters from various newspapers, attended. The Director of the Business Group of the company presided over the meeting.

(2) Shanghai-Nanjing-Hankou-Guilin-Guangzhou-Hong Kong line. (3) Hong Kong-Guangzhou-Kunming-Bhamo-Calcutta line. (4) Beiping-Taiyuan line. For months, the company has been incurring increasing monthly losses. According to the statistics for January, February, and March of this year, the company's flight cost is more than 200 yuan per kilometer per passenger, while the current fare is only 68.32 yuan per kilometer per passenger, which is almost three times less than the cost. The company is aware of its significant mission during the post-war recovery period and has been working hard to sustain operations until today. Now, the financial situation has reached a dangerous point, and the future of air transport still needs expansion. Therefore, it deeply hopes that people from all walks of life will show their understanding and support.</p>

The silver shop accepted the money as usual and then paid 150,000 yuan of it to a paint merchant. When the merchant deposited the money in the bank, the teller, seeing that the notes were suspicious, used a magnifying glass to identify them as counterfeit and immediately returned them to the merchant.

<h3>Yuan Meiyun – Good News – Suspension of Execution – Not Hopeless</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Film star Yuan Meiyun was sentenced by the District Court to six months in prison and deprived of public rights for one year due to opium addiction. Later, Yuan's family filed a petition to suspend the execution, and after examination by a forensic doctor arranged by the procuratorate, it was found that she was no longer addicted to drugs. Citing Article 88 of the Criminal Law, the procuratorate requested the Criminal Tribunal of the District Court to exempt her from execution, but the request was rejected by Judge Shen Tianbao. Xian Chuanbang, a prosecutor from District Court, opposed the rejection of the request. A complaint was filed on the 24th, and two copies were made. One was sent to the District Court to be forwarded to the High Court, and the other was sent to the defendant Yuan Meiyun.</p>
<p>The complaint stated: The defendant Yuan Meiyun, female, 29 years old, from Tianjin, in custody, was detained by the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau on April 12th for a drug case and sentenced by this court on May 17th to six months imprisonment, limited to two months for compulsory drug rehabilitation. Subsequently, the prosecutor noted that the defendant had been imprisoned for more than three months in the detention center of this court and Shanghai Prison, and that the forensic doctor of this court had examined her and found that she no longer had drug addiction. It was deemed that there was no need to execute the punishment, and a request was made to exempt her from the execution of the sentence. However, the Criminal Tribunal of this court rejected the request, stating that there was no record of the execution of the compulsory drug rehabilitation. It has been discovered that Yuan Meiyun has been in the detention center and Shanghai Prison for over three months since being transferred from the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau to this court, which has passed two months from the date of the judgment. During this period, the defendant has been effectively subjected to compulsory drug rehabilitation in the detention center of this court and Shanghai Prison. The original judgment also limited two months for compulsory drug rehabilitation, and so on. It has both the form and substance of the compulsory drug rehabilitation and is not entirely without the execution of the compulsory drug rehabilitation. It is not inconsistent with the provisions of Article 88, Paragraph 3 of the Criminal Law. Therefore, this appeal is lodged, requesting that the original ruling be revoked and a new ruling be made. This is addressed to the Shanghai High Court.</p>

<h3>Deadline for Applications This Afternoon; Regularly Scheduled General Sale of Low-Priced Sugar; Wholesale and Retail Prices Have Been Set</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The widespread sale of low-priced sugar in the city can be realized by next Tuesday at the latest. The Social Affairs Bureau has reached an agreement with the Taiwan Sugar Corporation and the local Southern Goods and Tea Food industries. The Taiwan Sugar Corporation will wholesale sugar to designated retail stores at a price of 74,000 yuan per dan (100 kg), which will then be sold to citizens at a price of 860 yuan per jin (500 g). It is understood that the registration procedures for the relevant industries will close this afternoon. As of last night, the industries that have registered to retail (or use for their own purposes) include the Southern Goods industry, the Tea Food industry, and the Candy and Biscuit industry. The list of store registrations from the soft drink industry has not yet been sent to the bureau. The cooked food industry has also requested to register, and Director Wu has instructed that "a review of the nature of this industry should be conducted before approval." Only two organizations, such as the Jinghu Railway Bureau, have requested sugar for their own use. Three consumer cooperatives have applied for registration. Of the more than 500 Southern Goods businesses in the city, 367 have applied to join through the trade association, requesting a total of 5,000 bags. It is reported that the bureau has approved this request. The Tea Food industry has requested more than 3,000 bags. The principle of approval is as follows: those requesting 20 bags or less will be fully approved, while those requesting more than 20 bags will be approved for half the requested amount. After the amounts are approved, the Social Affairs Bureau will transfer payments directly to the Taiwan Sugar Corporation. It is reported that the payment procedures can be completed by Saturday after the registration deadline at noon today, with delivery on Monday, and sales can begin by next Tuesday at the latest at a price of 860 yuan per jin. Smaller stores in the unregistered industries can purchase in bulk from their counterparts at a price of 81,000 yuan per dan. Their retail price will also be 860 yuan per jin. According to the chairman of the Southern Goods Association, the association will assign 36 supervisors to patrol the areas where low-priced Taiwan sugar is sold in the 18 districts of the city to prevent members of the industry from concealing or raising prices. Citizens can also report any such incidents to the trade association or the Social Affairs Bureau.</p>
<p>Sugar Merchants Petition the Bureau to Order Foreign Sugar to Shanghai</p>
<p>After the Social Affairs Bureau and the Taiwan Sugar Corporation established a sugar allocation method that directly allocated sugar to retailers, the local sugar merchants were alarmed. Yesterday morning, they convened an emergency meeting of the industry and appointed Liu Meibo, Liu Songxin, Li Fengchang, and Zhu Guoming to petition the Social Affairs Bureau yesterday afternoon. It is understood that Director Wu stated that sugar from the seventh allocation period would not be allocated to sugar merchants, but that this could be considered from the eighth period onwards. It is also learned that some sugar merchants, due to the Taiwan Sugar Corporation's control of the entire transport, marketing, and allocation of sugar, have ordered foreign sugar to Shanghai from four foreign firms with very favorable terms. The sugar is expected to arrive in port by the middle of next month at the latest, with a price of 80,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Gold Prices Slightly Lower, US Dollar Continues to Fall</h3>
<p>The market was sluggish and lackluster. Gold opened at around 1.95 million yuan in the morning. After opening, the high price was 1.952 million yuan. The US dollar eased significantly. Later, the price retreated to 1.94 million yuan. The central government allocated 100 bars, and the price also retreated to 1.9425 million yuan. After 10:00 AM, the market became even more peaceful, struggling at around 1.945 million yuan until noon. The afternoon remained peaceful, and the final price was slightly lower than the previous close. The purchase price for gold ornaments was 1.007 million yuan per tael. Silver was flat, while silver dollars fell slightly. Interest rates were very loose, ranging from 0.1 to 0.12.</p>
<p>After the US dollar was suppressed by physical goods, many floating positions were sold off, causing the price to fall from 2,570 yuan all the way down to 2,525 yuan, before stabilizing slightly. At noon, the price hovered around 2,540 yuan. The afternoon remained flat, and the final price continued to fall by 20 yuan compared to the previous close. Hong Kong currency was initially flat but then weakened, with the final price falling by another 5 yuan compared to the previous close. The Hong Kong exchange rate was around 550 yuan. The Indian exchange rate was 660 to 670 yuan. The British exchange rate was 8,800 to 8,900 yuan. The US exchange rate was nominally flat but actually stagnant.</p>
<h3>Cotton Loans in the Planning Stages</h3>
<p>Total Amount May Be 30 Billion</p>
<p>With the cotton harvest season approaching, the Farmers Bank of China is cooperating with the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry to prepare cotton transportation and sales loans. The target of the loans is cotton farms and cotton farmers, and the scale is quite large. It is understood that the loan methods are being planned by the Farmers Bank and the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry. The country will be divided into several regions for purchase and sale. The loan amount may be 30 billion yuan, and ginneries will be established in various regions. It is planned to purchase 60 of the most suitable cotton gins to be set up in 30 factories, exclusively for cotton processing and packaging.</p>
<p>Depressed Bond Market</p>
<p>The bond market remains weak. Although there were a few outsiders who came to buy in the middle of the day, it did not attract the attention of all parties. Category C bonds reached a high price of 800 yuan at the opening in the morning, and a low price of 750 yuan at the close at noon. The final price fell by 60 yuan compared to the previous close. Category A and B bonds were still flat, while Category D and E bonds fell slightly by 20 to 30 yuan.</p>
<h3>Demand for Spot Cotton is Quite Strong; Yarn Prices Were Weak Yesterday</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the yarn market was externally tight but internally weak. Yarn factories were unwilling to sell at low prices due to reduced production, while buyers were unwilling to purchase due to sluggish sales and low prices in the interior. The stalemate was difficult to sustain, so prices began to decline yesterday, falling by an average of 10,000 to 20,000 yuan. Sentiment was also very weak, with no sign of a rally.</p>
<p>Yesterday, New York US cotton telegrams suddenly fell by 100 pounds. The near-term price was US$34.38, the long-term price was US$34.41, and the spot price of Midling cotton was US$35.06. Local spot cotton transactions were again enthusiastic. The market price was not affected by the sharp drop in US cotton, because private factories have a strong need. Factories such as Dacheng, Xinsheng, Anda, and Qingfeng all made purchases. The market price continued to fall by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Taking Over Enemy and Puppet Factories: Three Suggestions from the Industrial Sector</h3>
<p>Regarding the thirteen factories that have contributed to the war effort being allowed to take over enemy and puppet factories, as reported in this newspaper, a leader from the industrial sector in the rear area said: It is deeply regrettable that this matter has only been approved today, as it would have been of greater assistance if it could have been realized half a year earlier. The industrial sector in the rear area now has three suggestions for consideration. First: We hope for widespread application, as these thirteen factories are not the only ones that have contributed to the war effort. Other factories should also be given preferential treatment to avoid any perceived bias. Second: Installment payments, with the price paid in installments over five years. Third: The machinery of each factory should be valued according to current U.S. market prices. If the price is based on domestic market prices and must be paid in a lump sum, it is feared that no factory in the rear area will accept such preferential treatment. The above three points have been presented to Special Commissioner Zhang of the Ministry of Economic Affairs. Representatives from various factories in Hunan and Guangxi who are petitioning in Beijing also plan to raise these issues.</p>
<h3>Pingshui Tea Costs Exceed Market Price: Tea Merchants Request Government Relief, China Trust Bureau Already Taking Reasonable Measures, Anhui Tea Merchants Also Applying</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The green tea produced in Pingshui (Shaoxing), Zhejiang, for export, includes varieties such as Chunmee and Gunpowder tea. The annual output is no less than 200,000 boxes, with the United States being the main market. Although some of the new crop has been produced and shipped to Shanghai, the foreign firms are quite demanding on pricing, offering only slightly more than 100,000 yuan per dan. The tea producers state that the cost of raw green tea in the production area is about 70,000 to 80,000 yuan per dan, and when adding the labor for re-processing and all taxes and fees, the cost per dan is at least 200,000 yuan. Based on the current situation, the losses are significant. Some time ago, the tea merchants there once requested the government to purchase the tea to reduce losses. It is now heard that the China Trust Bureau has already taken reasonable measures and is actively proceeding. It is also learned that tea merchants in Tunxi and other production areas in Huizhou, Anhui, are also planning to appeal to the authorities for similar treatment.</p>
<h3>Rice Market Weak for Several Days, Yesterday Began to Rebound, New Rice from Various Places Arriving Continuously</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the northern and southern markets together received more than 6,000 shi of rice. After several days of sharp declines, the shops took advantage of the situation to buy. Sales in the southern market have become more active, and sales in the northern market are also not bad. High-quality rice is firm, and medium-grade rice has rebounded by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. New rice from Zhejiang, Nanjing, Pudong, and other places has all arrived on the market, but the quantity is still small and there is no official market price yet. It is expected that a large amount will arrive after autumn. Flour from Wuxi is still in strong demand, but sales are sluggish, down by another 300 to 400 yuan. The factories have also reduced prices by 200 to 300 yuan. Shantou dealers are selectively buying high-quality wheat, but the Ningbo merchants' appetite for lower-grade wheat is not strong, so high-quality wheat has risen by 400 to 500 yuan, while medium and lower grades are stable. Although soybeans have arrived, the oil factories' appetite is not strong. Sales on this street are normal, and Chaozhou merchants are buying slightly, so the situation is stable. Green beans, broad beans, and red beans are all weak, while raw peanuts are stable. The supply of cooking oil is still scarce, and the Guangdong merchants are still active, so raw oil has continued to rise by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. Soybean oil and rapeseed oil have also risen by about 1,000 yuan. Sales of soybean cakes in the countryside have slowed down, and the price has become stable.</p>
<h3>Stock Market Remains Weak</h3>
<p>There is still profit-taking on Chinese stocks, and there has been no improvement. However, due to loose monetary policy, there has been some bottom-fishing and trading activity. Qin Hing is relatively stable because it is being sold together with underwear at a low price. The prices of various stocks fluctuated greatly during the day. At the high point, Wing On Textiles was 660 yuan, Mei Ah 4,500 yuan, King Fook 255 yuan, Sun Kwong 240 yuan, and Qin Hing 180 yuan. At the low point, Wing On Textiles was 620 yuan, Mei Ah 4,120 yuan, King Fook 220 yuan, Sun Kwong 220 yuan, and Qin Hing 155 yuan. At the midday close, the market turned hesitant, and as a result, Wing On Textiles, Mei Ah, King Fook, and Sun Kwong all fell by a little less than 5%, while Qin Hing rose slightly. Smaller and less popular stocks fell again by about 5%, and underwear, which was being sold together, fell by 10%. Original stocks also declined.</p>
<p>Foreign stocks remained difficult to support, but the fluctuations have narrowed. Ewo Textiles fell from 9,100 yuan to 8,700 yuan, and Jardine Matheson fell from 9,200 yuan to 8,700 yuan. Trading was limited. As a result, compared to the previous close, Ewo Textiles, Wheelock Marden, and Shanghai Dockyards were unchanged, while Ewo Brewery, Jardine Engineering, Shanghai Land, and Asia Life were all slightly lower.</p>
<h3>Rumor of Caustic Soda Arrival</h3>
<p>It is rumored that a British trading firm has 3,000 barrels of caustic soda arriving, and 2,000 barrels of American goods have also been shipped from the South Pacific Islands, so people are feeling weak. The factories' appetite for raw materials is decreasing because they are stopping night work. Goods such as Red Eagle brand soda ash, bleaching powder, pure alkali, acetic acid, and sulfuric acid are not being traded, and the trend is particularly soft.</p>
<p>In other news, British firm Jardine Matheson bought 199 cases of aged Zhong Chou Chunmee tea, while Wu Chang Tea Company bought 85 cases of aged Te Gong tea and 47 cases of aged Shang Qimen tea. These were sold by Ning Shin Kee, Yee Chee Heng, and Lung Kee Hing. Other tea companies, such as Sun Wah, are still in negotiations with sellers. As for the shops and merchants on this street, sales remain strong. The prices of aged Shang Bai Lin, new Longjing from Wenzhou, and aged Zhong Chou Jasmine tea have all risen compared to the previous day's close, while the rest remain unchanged.</p>
<h3>China Trust and Tea Merchants Meet, Seeking Barter Trade with the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>The Central Trust Bureau is actively launching new plans to save the Chinese tea crisis, focusing on promoting barter trade with the Soviet Union. People in the tea industry are delighted to hear this news. It is understood that the Central Trust Bureau will convene representatives of tea merchants today, including key responsible persons from the Tea Merchants Association and the Export Guild, to discuss preliminary plans. Matters such as quality, price, and payment terms will all be discussed. Last night, various tea magnates were already preparing separately. If the discussions today yield satisfactory results, the tea merchants will quickly implement a barter trade plan in order to partially break through the tea industry's difficulties, and the overall hardship can be gradually alleviated. As for the Qimen tea that has already been produced, which is valued at 270,000,000 yuan and contains 15,000 boxes, it was decided at the Export Guild meeting held at 3 p.m. the day before yesterday to send telegrams to various tea firms, requiring them to send personnel with over 200 types of tea samples to Shanghai within ten days and hand them over to the Chinese Farmers Bank for inspection.</p>
<h3>Pre-War Deposits: Hong Kong Banks to Settle Separately</h3>
<p>For the settlement of account deposits by Hong Kong banks in the first half of this year, for depositors who had deposits before the war and have withdrawn a small portion after the restoration, the receipts and payments will not be calculated together temporarily. Pre-war deposits will still be listed in the deposit account, and the withdrawn funds will be treated as advance payments, with interest calculated monthly. Regarding the signatory rights of depositors, the banks have issued a notice to reorganize, stipulating that all signatory rights of commercial firms and companies must be authorized by all shareholders of the firm or company to be valid, in order to avoid disputes due to the many changes caused by the changing environment.</p>
<h3>Damaged Banknotes: Central Bank Exchanges as Much as Possible</h3>
<p>In order to reduce the unwarranted losses of the people, the Issuing Bureau of the Central Bank has expanded its original "Damaged Banknote Exchange" office to exchange damaged banknotes as much as possible, free of charge. However, for banknotes with a face value of less than three-quarters but more than one-half, only half of the face value will be exchanged. Those who deliberately damage banknotes will not be accepted.</p>
<h3>Atomic Stoves: Available for Sale in Hong Kong</h3>
<p>Following atomic pens, atomic lighters, and atomic cloth, the United States has also introduced atomic stoves and atomic fuel, which have recently arrived in Hong Kong. The atomic stove uses atomic fuel for combustion, which is economical and convenient. The Hong Kong distributor is the Minsheng Trading Company.</p>
<h3>Cotton, Cement, and Timber Shipped Successively from Britain and the United States</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Cotton, cement, and timber are being imported in large quantities. The British company's freighter "Syrmian," which arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday from London via Singapore, brought over 29,000 bags of cement and over 1,000 tons of miscellaneous goods from Britain, as well as 5,630 pieces of pine lumber from Singapore, and also 488 boxes of legal tender. The Chinese and American Shipping Company's manager Lamas, arrived from the United States with 13,140 pieces of cotton, which is relief supplies. The Taikoo Company's British and American freighter arrived from Qinhuangdao with 600 bags of cement.</p>
<h3>Dutch Gold Nationalized, Includes Precious Metals and Foreign Currencies</h3>
<p>[Reuters, The Hague, 25th] The Dutch government has ordered the Dutch people to deposit or sell all gold, precious metals, and any currency held abroad to the Dutch Bank by July 23. Gold or precious metals acquired after July 8 without approval must also be deposited with the bank within ten days of acquisition.</p>
<h3>300 Tons of Yangquan White Coal Arrive: Fierce Price Surge in Firewood and Charcoal</h3>
<p>The white coal market remains firm, and all goods are steadily at their peak. 300 tons of Yangquan white coal were transported by Dalian ship yesterday. High-grade bituminous coal is in short supply on the market, and users are still actively purchasing, so the market price continues to rise. Bituminous coal powder is still depressed due to poor sales, and the market price is getting lower and lower. Firewood and charcoal have been boosted by the rise in white coal, and all parties' interest has turned active. Also, due to the scarcity of supply, the market atmosphere has suddenly improved, and all goods have seen a price surge.</p>

<h3>Disaster Victims and Refugees in the Five Southern Provinces Appeal to La Guardia</h3>
<p>— A Special Dispatch from Our Correspondent Lin Youlan in Hong Kong, dated the 17th</p>
<p>They painstakingly repaired the Yuehan Railway and built the Guangzhou-Kowloon Highway, fully expecting to receive large quantities of relief supplies from UNRRA... but La Guardia's ban deprived them of assistance!</p>
<p>Hong Kong is one of the three major UNRRA transportation centers in China. About 40% or more of the UNRRA relief supplies shipped to China are transshipped through Hong Kong. This percentage will continue to increase in the future, because behind Hong Kong lies the vast disaster area of South China, with countless famine victims and refugees awaiting urgent relief. Since the successive repairs and openings of the Yuehan Railway and the Guangzhou-Kowloon Highway, the relief supplies stranded on the opposite shore of Hong Kong in Kowloon for the past six months due to transportation difficulties are now surging into the disaster areas of Hunan, Hubei, Guangdong, and Guangxi like a tide along this major transportation artery. But at this time, the UNRRA Director-General ordered the suspension of relief shipments to China, which is a terrible blow to the disaster victims who have placed the greatest hope in UNRRA and have managed to survive through wind and dew over the years!</p>
<p>Mr. La Guardia ordered the suspension of relief shipments to China, initially saying that the relief supplies were being "used for political purposes"; then he pointed to "China's inability to supply facilities for unloading materials and the lack of inland transportation"; later he blamed the inefficiency of our distribution agencies. In addition to the fact that Director-General Jiang of the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration has answered each of these points one by one, the reporter would like to summarize the opinions of people in South China and add a few more words: (1) There are no political disputes in the South China region; (2) Transportation facilities in South China are improving day by day; (3) With smooth transportation, the drawbacks of the distribution agencies can be reduced. From this point of view, Mr. La Guardia made this "inhumane" decision without clearly understanding the situation in China, at least in South China.</p>
<p>Why Should Disaster Victims Suffer?</p>
<p>Everyone knows that the Yuehan Railway was repaired with the assistance of UNRRA. The flour eaten by the road workers was supplied by UNRRA, the road materials were supplied by UNRRA, and the replacement locomotives and freight cars were also supplied by UNRRA... The Chinese engineers did not fail UNRRA's good intentions and repaired this badly damaged railway in half a year. The Guangzhou-Kowloon Highway was also repaired with the assistance of UNRRA. The disaster victims in South China are now asking in unison: Why did Mr. La Guardia order the suspension of relief shipments to China? Why is the opening of the railway and highway regarded as "lack of transportation"? Is it because there is this excuse of "lack of transportation" that it is better to "temporarily lend" the food (2,000 tons of white rice) stranded in Kowloon to the Hong Kong government, and leave the famine victims in Hunan and Guangxi behind?</p>
<p>UNRRA is not unaware of the current tragic situation of the disaster victims in Hunan and Guangxi. President Truman's representative inspected the disaster areas of Hunan and Guangxi a month ago and publicly stated that he believed it was necessary to increase relief supplies in order to provide assistance. We understand UNRRA's situation and are unwilling to force others to do what is difficult and insist on demanding the allocated relief figures, but Mr. La Guardia must not think that he can be deceived and even order the suspension of relief shipments to China. Now, although we have agreed to continue shipping food to China, the refugees in South China, who are severely affected by the disaster, need other material relief in addition to the meager food. In South China, especially in Hunan and Guangxi, UNRRA has an unshirkable responsibility for the reconstruction of rural areas, the construction of industry, and even the dissemination of culture. Now that the transportation network in South China has been gradually restored, UNRRA's supplies are piled up on the west coast of the United States, and Mr. La Guardia is sitting idly by while millions of disaster victims, who have lost their homes and possessions in order to win the common victory of the Allied countries, are suffering from hunger and cold and are on the verge of death, and is tolerating the interruption of the relief supplies they have been praying for day and night. This is not justified in terms of reason or morality.</p>
<p>Please Look at the Disaster Situation</p>
<p>According to the reporter's investigation, the UNRRA relief food currently waiting to be transported in Kowloon is only 16,600 tons. According to the person in charge of the Kowloon Storage and Transportation Bureau, about 1,000 tons of relief supplies are transported from Kowloon to the provinces every day, so this number can be transported within two or three weeks. Other machinery, such as agricultural implements, trucks, and railway equipment, is also being assembled and successively imported into the interior of South China via highways or railways. The number of industrial raw materials allocated by UNRRA, such as cotton and cement, is extremely small, and the actual needs are even further apart. Even if Mr. La Guardia allows food and transportation equipment to continue to be shipped to China, without machinery and industrial raw materials, our factories will not be able to start work, and there will be no way to rebuild our villages and towns destroyed by the enemy. Millions of men and women will at most live a life of half-full and half-hungry, and will not escape the suffering of disaster victims. The UNRRA relief supplies were already insufficient to meet the actual needs. Mr. La Guardia recently departed from the United States to inspect UNRRA's operations in Europe. We hope that he can visit China along the way, especially taking the trouble to visit the provinces of Hunan and Guangxi, which are the most severely affected by the disaster, and see the real situation of his close neighbors on the other side of the Pacific Ocean. I believe that the clear-sighted and decisive former mayor of New York will regret his miscalculation in ordering the suspension of shipments!</p>
<p>"Death Warrant"</p>
<p>Millions of disaster victims in the five southern provinces are now hoping that Mr. La Guardia will quickly revoke the ban and actively transport relief supplies to China. They still have a sincere sense of appreciation for UNRRA and Mr. La Guardia. If Mr. La Guardia still fails to understand the true situation, is ignorant of the facts, and insists on going his own way, then Mr. La Guardia will create an extremely bad impression in the minds of the disaster victims in South China—in the minds of all the Chinese people. What is the reason for this? Please allow the reporter to state it:</p>
<p>The Yuehan Railway, which runs through Central and South China, was opened by UNRRA as the first railway to be repaired in China after the war. If what it brings into South China and even the interior of China is not the supplies that can alleviate disasters and save lives, but the European and American goods that absorb China's remaining economic blood, not the relief supplies that are relied on to revive the broken and dismembered rural villages and towns, but the foreign materials that destroy the vitality of Chinese society, not the machinery and tools that build up the dying national industry, but the cheap commodities that overwhelm China's economic recovery, then Mr. La Guardia will be giving the disaster victims in China the most effective "death warrant", accelerating the death of the disaster victims in China, and at the same time contributing to the total collapse of China's economy and society!</p>
<p>Final Expectations</p>
<p>The reporter would like to specifically point out: The warehouses in Hong Kong are now filled with various cheap European and American goods and expensive luxury goods, ready to take advantage of the Yuehan Railway to enter the interior of China in two ways, pouring into the interior of China with the power of gold dollars and pounds, making a new attempt to "conquer" China. Of course, we cannot blame this possible tide of violence and waves on Mr. La Guardia's unwise decision. But UNRRA is an international organization that "relieves" disaster victims and assists countries that have suffered from war in "post-war" rehabilitation. In the past, it has continuously given us various material assistance to relieve the vast disaster situation and gradually revive the countries that have been severely destroyed. If the work is abandoned halfway, we have sufficient reason to ask Mr. La Guardia to immediately revoke the ban and continue to transport relief supplies as much as possible to meet our urgent needs—to eliminate the disaster situation and revive China.</p>
<p>The reporter is stationed in South China and has witnessed the above-mentioned matters, and only looks at this national issue from the perspective of South China. It cannot be denied that there have been many problems with the distribution agencies of relief supplies in South China. The disaster victims in South China feel this more keenly than Mr. La Guardia, and have now asked the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration to strive for reform. Mr. La Guardia has a compassionate heart to help the world, and should think from a broad perspective, and should not give up eating because of choking, or abandon the fundamentals and pursue the trivial, resulting in adverse consequences. The disaster victims in South China's accusations against Mr. La Guardia are well-intentioned. Until now, they do not seem to have lost their expectations for UNRRA.</p>
<p>A Sad Tale of Guangxi</p>
<p>— A Special Dispatch from Our Correspondent Liang Xiaozhong in Guilin, dated the 10th</p>
<p>Soaring prices are like a ruthless iron whip, striking people's hearts with panic and chaos. Rice! Rice! Rice! How many people are anxiously thinking about tomorrow's rice in their dreams, but how many people are using their position, borrowing their name, and colluding with some rice thieves from some bureau or public treasury who should have been shot long ago to desperately collect rice and hoard it like crazy, with compassionate words on their lips, but sucking the blood of the famine victims in their stomachs!</p>
<p>The Latest Model of Automobile Recently Invented in the United States (A Special Photograph sent by Our Correspondent for the New York Times)</p>
<h3>Selling Children with Straw Marks</h3>
<p>At a meeting of the Guilin City Council, the councilors asked with heartache and indignation: "Is there anyone hoarding goods to make a profit?" The answer was very generous: "The city government is paying close attention to this matter and has sent people to investigate everywhere. No hoarding has been found in the city so far." Beautiful, proper, and superior. If there is to be any discovery, unless Bao Zheng is resurrected. The "official stockpiles" of hundreds of thousands of catties in the suburbs, when will they have mercy?</p>
<p>On the one hand, officials are plotting and laughing slyly with the rice, and on the other hand, tragedies of selling children with straw marks are found everywhere in the province, lined up on the streets. With 150 catties of grain, you can happily take away a hungry "soul". Before the crops have turned green or yellow, and before right and wrong can be distinguished, what can heaven do?</p>
<h3>Cannot Steal, Difficult to Endure Hunger</h3>
<p>There are too many reports about bandits. Talking about some petty thieves may not be boring. When the relief rice from UNRRA arrived in Guilin, the famine victims ran to the rice boats and dug open the rice bags with their fingers, stealing three or five taels and tasting a meal of old punches. When the relief flour was "collected and stored" in the warehouse, the famine victims scraped the powder from the outside of the bags with bamboo strips in groups, and were also severely beaten. When the rice entered the warehouse and the flour also entered the warehouse, the famine victims had to wait and see. The taro and sweet potato seeds planted outside the fields were dug up before they even sprouted. A "gentle thief" dug up a patch of sweet potato seeds from a She field and left a note on the ground: "Knowing that seeds cannot be stolen, it is pitiful that hunger is unbearable." Fourteen characters, so glaring.</p>
<h3>Three Million Potential Starving Ghosts</h3>
<p>The new crops are far away, and the collection of land taxes is like ten thousand stars of fire. The collection of taxes is as many as the numbers, not a single point is reduced. In addition, another 30% of public grain must be added. How many disasters, but another big stone must be pressed on them! The people of Guangxi are born with a hard life. They dare not complain, nor will they complain. If the country wants them to die, how can they resist? I hope the government will show more pity, and they will endure the tears without saying a word.</p>
<p>In addition to land taxes and public grain, there are also ropes that are tightly wrapped around the hearts of the people of Guangxi. After the revision of the fiscal revenue and expenditure system, the original budgeted revenue of Guangxi Province was 3 billion yuan, while the expenditure was 8 billion yuan, with a total deficit of 5 billion yuan. Where does this 5 billion yuan come from? Naturally, the wool always comes from the sheep. Every three steps is inseparable from the word "tax", and now the tax items in almost every county are too many to count. In addition to land taxes and public grain, there are prosperity donations, military grain, self-defense donations, garrison donations, slaughter taxes, tobacco and alcohol license taxes, restaurant taxes, health surcharges, use license taxes, public scale fees, stall donations, ... and I don't know how many temporary levies, truly donating everything and donating heavily, with many patterns, which cannot be fully described. Adding to the 5 billion yuan, 3.15 million of the province's 14.6 million people are famine victims who are "potential starving ghosts", to squeeze out their intestines and internal organs.</p>
<h3>A Miserably Small Disaster Relief Donation</h3>
<p>The disaster is deep and heavy; how much progress is there in the work of rescuing the starving and saving lives? One drought after another, one flood after another, scaring people so much that their hearts leap to their lips. It's already the sixth month of the lunar calendar, and the new grain should have been harvested long ago, but the rice in the fields hasn't sprouted yet. The number of people lying on the ridges of the fields starving to death is increasing day by day. There's no money for disaster relief, so we rely on donations. Most people in the province are waiting to be saved, so where will the money come from? The county with the fewest disaster victims has 30,000 people, and the county with the most has as many as 97% of its population affected by the disaster. The province can't think of any other way, so it can only extend a hand for help! Fellow Guangxi natives living outside the province have been running around appealing for help, and the Guangzhou headquarters has ordered its subordinates to cut back on food and donate. The Shanghai press has also raised some money on behalf of the victims. But all this adding up makes for a pitifully small amount. To be honest, the disaster in Guangxi is no lighter than the one in Hunan, but the results of the relief efforts are as different as earth and sky. Why is this? We beg our compatriots across the country to save the lives of the people of Guangxi!</p>
<p>Amidst the cries of disaster, the Provincial Assembly has finally achieved a result: the dispute over the speaker has been resolved. The Ministry of Interior replied with a telegram, stating that there was no reason to consider Chen Xiguang's four votes with the character "Xi" as invalid votes. As a result, Chen Xiguang was steadily elected Speaker of the Assembly with 44 votes. Li Renren failed. The Assembly, which had been in a complete mess, finally saw clear skies. Chen assumed the post of Speaker, and the Provincial Government was finally willing to attend and give a policy report (the Provincial Authorities refused to attend and give a policy report while the Speaker issue was unresolved). The congress was extended, and the assemblymen once again made appeals for disaster relief and raised stern questions. It seems as if many things combined are like an unhealed wound, and every time it is soothed, it is pain and blood. The people of Guangxi have truly suffered enough!</p>

<h3>Such a Township Head!</h3>
<p>Dear Editor:</p>
<p>I have a relative who was a very kind farmer before the war. During the war, he joined the National Army to resist the enemy. After our village fell, he joined the guerrillas to harass the enemy. After the victory, he returned to his village and continued to farm. Unexpectedly, he was accused by the township head, So-and-so, using his henchmen, of being a stray guerrilla fighter. He was detained and extorted. Later, the local troops found out about it and, because there was no evidence, he was released. However, my relative lost more than 20 "shi" of rice as a result. But the township head really knows how to take advantage of opportunities, so he threatened the ignorant villagers who originally accused my relative, and they also lost more than 30 "shi" of rice. The township head, fearing that the matter would be exposed, framed my relative again, and unfortunately he was detained again. I dare to ask the authorities to uphold justice and thoroughly investigate this matter, so as to relieve the people of their suffering. (A villager from Chashan Township, Jinwei District, Jinshan County)</p>
<h3>The Abominable Wenzhou Liners</h3>
<p>Dear Editor:</p>
<p>The shipowners of the liners sailing from Shanghai to Wenzhou are heartless and insane, and the ship's stewards are vicious and unscrupulous, extorting passengers without restraint, leaving them in great distress with nowhere to turn! Here are six of the most egregious examples: Can there really be no law and no order on the seas?</p>
<p>1. The ships have a limited carrying capacity. The shipowners, blinded by greed, secretly load cargo after the customs officers have sealed the hatches, so that the goods are piled up like mountains, blocking the passage, and even the places for urination and defecation are used for storing goods. If they encounter storms, the danger is extreme!</p>
<p>2. After the ships arrive at port, soldiers are asked to guard the hatches and passengers are not allowed to board until the day of departure. At this time, the cargo is already piled up and the hatches cannot be reopened, so male and female passengers, young and old, have to climb aboard using ropes (their luggage is only hung outside the ship). Moreover, it was raining that day and the ropes were slippery. A misstep could mean disaster for the elderly and young.</p>
<p>3. The fare for each person in steerage includes 3,200 yuan for food (a total of four meals, averaging 800 yuan per meal). The shipowners require this to be collected at the time of ticketing. Two meals are served each day, with no vegetables at all, so that passengers eat less. They don't care at all if passengers starve or get sick for two days and three nights. It is estimated that after one voyage, they can rake in millions of yuan from food costs alone.</p>
<p>4. After buying a ticket for steerage, one could originally lie down on the floor of the steerage area, but unexpectedly it is completely filled with cargo. The stewards forcibly set up sleeping boards, each of which (about three feet wide) is sold for 30,000 yuan, with the permission of the shipowner. As a result, those who cannot afford to buy a board have nowhere to stand. How can they not get sick after two days and three nights!</p>
<p>5. The ship's stewards treat the passengers like prisoners, with harsh voices and unbearable attitudes. If you argue with them, you run the risk of being beaten!</p>
<h3>The Key to Managing Grain</h3>
<p>Dear Editor: Since Mayor Wu strictly cracked down on speculation, the price of rice in Shanghai has remained stable for a long time, for which we citizens are deeply grateful. However, with strict price controls, traders have no profit to be made, and the amount of rice stored in Shanghai is gradually decreasing. In the future, if the source really becomes scarce, the black market price will be unimaginably high. Furthermore, low grain prices hurt farmers, which will also affect rice production in the future. Rice is produced and sold domestically. Instead of trying to lower the price of rice, we should allow it to have a reasonable price so that farmers are not at too much of a disadvantage and do not feel that farming is not worthwhile. There were examples of farming being unprofitable last year, and it is even harder to say this year. The key to managing grain is to minimize exploitation between producers and consumers, so that merchants do not reap huge profits. It is definitely not enough to just focus on lowering the price of rice. We who live in the city only hear the voices of consumers, and rarely hear the voices of producers, so our views differ from those of farmers. (Shi Chisheng)</p>
<h3>Surplus Milk for Starving Children</h3>
<p>Dear Editor:</p>
<p>According to reports, milk sheds in this city are pouring milk into sewers due to poor business. The goods are discarded on the ground, wasting resources, which is a great pity. I wonder, is this surplus milk? Or is it sour milk? In my opinion, if it is indeed good milk, it could be sent to refugee camps daily. I imagine that many refugees suffer from malnutrition, or are infants and young children lacking wet nurses. This would allow them to get adequate nutrition, which would preserve the nation's vitality. Milk sheds would also find a suitable way to dispose of the milk. I hope the owners of milk sheds in this city will consider adopting this suggestion. (Yu Yuying)</p>
<h3>Talking About Essential Medicines for Malaria</h3>
<p>– Xu Xiangren, an Old Man of Sixty-Six</p>
<p>Dear Editor: Mr. Chen Guofu, as a party and state elder, advocated for traditional Chinese medicine. 消盡, I saw the chronicle yesterday and suddenly arrived with it, drafting this short article. I do not wish to use this to seek fame, but merely as a reference. I wish you success in your work! Respectfully submitted by Xu Xiangren.</p>
<p>Social Services</p>
<p>To understand the treatment of malaria, one must first understand the source of malaria. It occurs after the Beginning of Autumn, End of Heat, and White Dew periods. Having chills followed by fever is considered true malaria. Having chills and fever at irregular times in spring, summer, and winter is considered similar to malaria. Experiencing it once a day indicates a mild case; once every two days indicates a more severe case; once every three days indicates the most severe case. Malaria is caused by external factors such as sudden cold after heat, seeking coolness and being exposed to dew, blocking the "rong wei" [Nutritive Qi and Defensive Qi, which comprise the Wei Qi] and "qi." Internal factors include consuming too much raw, cold, greasy food, suppressing the stomach Qi and preventing it from spreading. Malaria does not have as many variations as typhoid fever, but tertian malaria can linger for years, forming a "malaria mother" [splenomegaly], causing a yellow complexion and thinness, indicating exhaustion of stomach Qi.</p>
<p>The most effective medicines for malaria are Changshan and Caoguo. Changshan has a cold nature and is toxic, causing vomiting. It should be stir-fried with ginger juice before use. Malaria cannot develop without phlegm; phlegm is transformed from greasy substances. It is commonly believed that malaria patients who can eat are easier to treat, because beggars have no access to meat and greasy food, so no phlegm is produced in their stomachs. Changshan can remove the phlegm, so it is called a "robber agent." Caoguo has a warm nature and is non-toxic, not causing vomiting. It can transform cold phlegm and dispel miasma from fog and dew, so it is considered as important as Changshan and is also an effective medicine for malaria. From the perspective of a medical doctor prescribing medicine (the perspective of a medical doctor prescribing medicine and a pharmacist compounding it are completely different), these two ingredients alone cannot form a prescription. Therefore, if cold prevails, Cinnamon Twig and ginger are added. If heat prevails, Skullcap and Anemarrhena are added (sometimes it is necessary to use both cold and heat remedies). For excessive phlegm, Pinellia Ternata, Fritillariae Cirrhosae and Tangerine Peel are added. These are all essential medicines for true malaria. As for warm malaria, miasma malaria, female malaria, male malaria, malaria forming nodules (malaria mother), malaria turning into consumption, use Cornu Cervi Degelatinatum and Aconite for Yang areas, and Polygonum Multiflorum and Dolichos Lablab for Yin areas. After the illness, it is necessary to regulate the spleen and stomach, and to avoid pork (there used to be a farmer in Muxi Township who would experience severe chills and tremors every time he ate fresh pork, and he would recover on his own. The villages are prone to malaria, and he must have had tertian malaria), duck meat, cold and raw shellfish, mung beans, hyacinth beans, tofu, vermicelli, and bean curd sheets for 100 days. If these are violated within 100 days, there will invariably be a relapse. During and after the illness, it is necessary to leave the table. All who are treating or being treated for malaria must know this.</p>
<p>[Note from Traditional Chinese Medicine practitioner Shen Yaoxian] Mr. Xiangren has been practicing medicine for decades and has unique experiences in treating illnesses. His discussion of the relationship between patients' dietary habits and constitution is to take the patient into account, so his treatment plan applies different methods based on different constitutions. This is a truly profound meaning. However, the source of malaria is mostly the transmission of bacteria by mosquitoes, so Western medicine uses quinine to treat malaria, aiming to kill the bacteria. Sometimes arsenic and mercury preparations, such as 606, are injected to treat severe malaria. From this, we can see that the first priority in treating malaria is to kill the bacteria. Changshan and Caoguo are indeed effective in cutting off malaria. Changshan has a cold nature, a bitter taste, and is poisonous. It is not yet confirmed in current pharmacological experiments whether it has the ability to kill bacteria, but it can stimulate the central nervous system, reduce body temperature, reduce the excretion of nitrogen, and prevent the rise of body temperature. It is indeed effective. In Traditional Chinese Medicine, the focus is on dispelling phlegm and fluids. Caoguo has a warm nature and a pungent taste, and its functions include cutting off malaria with phlegm, eliminating accumulated cold food. Doctors say, "Malaria cannot occur without phlegm." Using the two phlegm-expelling ingredients is no different from driving out bacteria, which has a profound meaning. Based on my limited understanding, Changshan and Caoguo are essential medicines for cutting off malaria, but the addition of vermifuges such as smoked plums, betel nuts, and Dichroa Febrifuga, if symptoms allow, would be even more effective.</p>

<p>Dear Sir, We are writing to inform you that on the afternoon of the first of this month, a motorized sailboat departed from Qinglong Port to Shanghai, carrying about 30 to 40 male and female passengers. While passing near Shizilin in Baoshan County, a fire suddenly broke out and the boat burned. At the time, male and female passengers jumped into the river to save their lives, and their fate is unknown. On the morning of the 4th, a female corpse of unknown origin was floating on the sea embankment outside the north gate of this town. The female corpse was approximately 40 years old, with a long, round face and long hair. She was wearing a dark blue homespun short shirt, black homespun trousers, small feet, and white socks. She had no shoes. Her height was approximately 4 feet 9 inches. We have already prepared a coffin and buried her on her behalf. We hope that the deceased's family members will quickly come to this town's office to claim the burial. We respectfully ask your newspaper to borrow a corner to publish this on our behalf, and we will be eternally grateful. Respectfully, to the Editor of the Shen Bao, Baoshan County Chengxiang District Chengxiang Town Office.</p>

<h3>A Historical Account of Cholera</h3>
<p>— Zheng Weiru</p>
<p>Opening modern medical books, the definition of cholera reads, "An acute, specific infectious disease affecting the ileum, characterized by copious rice-water stools, watery diarrhea, vomiting, muscle cramps, anuria, collapse, and death. It is an endemic disease, often spreading via water and land routes to become an epidemic. The causative agent is the cholera vibrio." From this definition, one can understand the symptoms, transmission, and causative agent of cholera. Ancient Chinese medical texts, such as the "Neijing," state that disorders in the stomach and intestines are called cholera. The "Ling Shu" says, "Clear qi is in the yin, turbid qi is in the yang; when clear and turbid interfere, it is cholera." These texts mostly describe abnormal gastrointestinal symptoms without classifying cholera as a specific disease. Although the "Neijing" may not date back to antiquity, it was transmitted by people during the Zhou and Qin dynasties, so around 1000 BC, China probably did not have the current form of cholera. Leafing through the revised and enlarged "Complete Book of Cold Damage," "jiaochangsha" (twisting bowel disorder) is described as, "In summer, without headache or fever, but feeling pain in the lower abdomen, or pain and distension in both the heart and abdomen, unable to stretch. People may suspect it is yin syndrome or attribute it to eating too much raw and cold food, not knowing it is due to summer heat flowing and concentrating, and the internal organs unable to resolve it, thus the lower abdomen pains first, then spreads to the heart and abdomen." This seems to describe symptoms like bowel obstruction or visceral stones, not true cholera. The same book also describes the vomiting method for "dry cholera": "Summer heat enters the abdomen, causing nausea and abdominal pain, vomiting and diarrhea, the diarrhea being like water pouring out. This is due to the violent eruption of summer heat, disrupting ascent and descent, separating clear and turbid, and the diarrhea is the body fluids of the five viscera. It should be stopped quickly... Sometimes this condition is mixed with food stagnation, which doctors mistake for food injury and treat with purging, which is wrong. Some also say that it is the removal of impurities, not knowing that the body fluids are rapidly depleted, and the original qi is greatly damaged. Stopping it immediately is the best course. Furthermore, if there is no vomiting or diarrhea, it is dry cholera, causing immediate death..." Whether this condition is the same as today's true dry cholera is impossible to confirm because the description is not thorough. This book was compiled and edited by Zhang Heteng in the third year of the Tianqi era (1623), drawing on various famous masters. According to Koda Tsutomu's experience, the modern so-called dry cholera has no diarrhea, but this does not mean there is no exudate in the intestines. In many cases, patients did not have diarrhea before death, but autopsy revealed the intestines filled with fluid. Cholera deaths without vomiting or diarrhea are rare. According to the works of Anaslan and Tuhui Ning, there is little mention of this. Kerping also stated that this condition is extremely rare. Mike Folsom even frankly said that he had never seen dry cholera. Therefore, whether the above description is a symptom of acidosis is unknown. The original book also states that summer syndrome develops into fever, vomiting, diarrhea, and cholera, and after prolonged illness, develops into malaria and dysentery... thus, vomiting, diarrhea, malaria, and dysentery are indistinguishable, which is a far-fetched argument.</p>
<p>In 1813, Wu Tang published "Wenbing Tiaobian" (Analysis of Warm Diseases), stating, "Cholera is most common in the long summer, rooted in yang deficiency and cold-dampness accumulation, and its impact is not light, harming people in an instant." It also says, "Vomiting and dysentery, cold and heat, body pain, or no cold or heat, but abdominal pain, is called cholera." It further states, "Vomiting, diarrhea, sweating, fever, chills, stiff limbs, cold hands and feet." Judging from the symptoms, it is quite similar to true cholera. This book was written ten years before it was published, so China had true cholera before 1803. However, to diagnose cholera from a modern scientific medical perspective, the true cholera vibrio must be detected in the patient's vomit and diarrhea. However, clinical experience shows that symptoms can closely resemble cholera but the patient's vomit and diarrhea do not contain the cholera vibrio. Conversely, some patients with symptoms unlike cholera have cholera vibrio detected in their feces.</p>
<p>The Homeland of Cholera</p>
<p>According to "Cholera" by Rogers, "The cholera records of the 1817 Indian pandemic are indeed detailed and accurate. At that time, the epidemic was so widespread and virulent that some considered it a new disease unprecedented in history. However, according to John McPherson, the records of Sanskrit historians and Hippocrates as early as 400 BC are quite similar to today's cholera. From 1503 to 1817, there were about a dozen cholera epidemics. In the 17th century, cholera was reported in the east coast of India, the East Indies, and China. From 1781 to 1783, it spread from Calcutta to Madras and Burma, almost reaching all parts of India. After 1794, it remained dormant for 23 years until it started spreading from Bengal, the home of cholera, to other places in 1817, reaching neighboring states, and the epidemic subsided in 1823." There are many conflicting opinions regarding the occurrence of this disease. In 1826, Kahn insisted that the disease must be transmitted by contact.</p>
<p>Spread to Europe</p>
<p>Wang Xunchen's "Yilin Cuocuo" (Corrections in the Forest of Medicine) states, "In the xinmao year of Daoguang's reign [1821], vomiting, diarrhea, and cramping affected several provinces, especially the capital. Too many people died. The poor who could not afford burial received coffins from the national treasury, costing hundreds of thousands of taels of silver in just over a month." Chen Xiuyuan's "Yixue Shizaiyi" (Practical Explanations of Medicine) records, "A student asked: 'In the gengchen and xinji years [1820, 1821], many people in Fujian died from this disease, starting in May and peaking in June and July, gradually lessening and becoming easier to cure after the White Dew season. In the gengchen year, there was a severe drought and extreme heat in the summer, so people thought the disease was caused by the heat. In the xinji year, there was no flooding but it was cold in the summer, so people thought the disease was caused by cold invasion. Yet the symptoms were the same in both years. What is the reason?'" The xinmao year of Daoguang's reign, 1821, and the first major cholera epidemic with reliable historical records occurred from 1817 to 1823, originating in the province of Bengal, India, corresponding to the years of Jiaqing 21 to Daoguang 3. Yu Yan's "Landao Yuhua" (Jade Talks from the Cold Hut) quotes "Lu Dingpu's Lanting Yuhua (Jade Talks from the Orchid Pavilion) saying, 'Since the gengchen year of Jiaqing [1820], patients have been continuous.'" He also quotes Xu Xinmu as saying, "In the xinmao year of Daoguang, this disease was rampant." Therefore, he says, "The epidemic of cholera in our country started in Fujian province in the 23rd year of Jiaqing [1818], and spread to various provinces, reaching Yanjing [Beijing] in the following year of Daoguang 1 [1821], clearly spreading from south to north." According to records, in 1818 (Jiaqing 23), cholera was transmitted from India to Fujian via water routes, then spread north to the capital. The major epidemic in India, Persia, and Europe from 1826 to 1837 also originated in Bengal, spreading north from Calcutta to Poland, Sweden, Berlin, Vienna, and Edinburgh. In 1832, London saw 4,000 deaths, and Paris had 7,000 deaths in 18 days. Quebec and Montreal in Canada, and New York in the United States, were also affected. Later, Portugal, Spain, and Italy were not spared. The epidemic completely stopped in 1838. At that time, transportation was still primitive, so it took five years to spread from Bengal to Europe. Later, due to the increasing development of transportation, it often spread from India to Europe in just a few months.</p>
<p>European Epidemics</p>
<p>During the European epidemic of 1847-1849, it is said that Russia had one million deaths, and Britain had over fifty-three thousand deaths. In 1849, Dr. Snow proposed that cholera was caused by toxins in the vomit and diarrhea of patients. If these toxins were ingested by others, they could be produced in large quantities in the intestines. He also stated that poor sewage systems allowed excrement to flow into rivers and wells. If this water was used for drinking, it would cause infection. At the same time, Bouchet also stated that cholera was caused by microorganisms growing in the intestines. However, in 1856, the Royal College of Physicians of England's theory of airborne transmission of toxins prevailed, overturning the above two theories completely.</p>
<p>Global Pandemic</p>
<p>In subsequent years, such as 1855, 1863, and 1866, several global pandemics originated in India, spreading to neighboring countries and Europe. From 1879-1883, the development of railway transportation in India caused the spread to accelerate. In 1883, Egypt had 50,000 deaths. Experts from Germany, France, and England were sent to conduct on-site investigations. Finally, Professor Koch of Germany discovered comma-shaped bacteria in the vomit and diarrhea of patients, revealing the secret of the cholera pathogen. At that time, McNamarra had gained considerable insights into cholera research. He had hypothesized that the rice-water excrement of cholera patients contained microorganisms, but the British government refused to fund McNamarra's research on this issue. After the Koch's research team published the germ theory, the British government sent bacterial experts to India to investigate, but the results of the investigation denied Koch's views.</p>
<p>During 1892-1895, the spread of cholera was even faster than before. In less than five months, it had spread from the northwestern provinces of India to St. Petersburg (Leningrad). Hamburg in Germany was also affected, and it spread to the United Kingdom and the United States within a few days. From 1918 to 1919, 500,000 people died in India from the major epidemic.</p>
<p>Point of Origin in India</p>
<p>Looking at the above history of cholera pandemics, most of them originated in India, with the delta downstream of the Ganges River in Bengal as the center of transmission. Therefore, Bengal is known as the "home of cholera." After the major epidemic from India spread to our country 95 years before the founding of the Republic of China, there have been annual epidemics, resulting in many deaths.</p>
<p>The Theory of Traditional Chinese Medicine</p>
<p>Among Confucian doctors in our country who personally experienced cholera epidemics and wrote medical theories, Wang Mengying stands out. He wrote "Cholera Treatise" (1837) and "Revised Cholera Treatise from Suixi Residence" (1862), both based on the theories of the Neijing and the Shanghan Lun, focusing on the debate between cold and heat. We cannot be overly critical, but we must praise his cholera theory, which states, "Cholera, sometimes called 'hanging leg spasm,' refers to cholera with muscle cramping, not a separate disease." "Cholera, sometimes called 'twisting bowel disorder,' is dry cholera." "Regardless of whether cholera exhibits cold limbs, aversion to cold, a white tongue, and a completely yin-cold appearance... it must be understood that cholera is always caused by summer heat. Extreme heat can resemble cold, which is false cold. Therefore, Xu Lingtai said that cold cholera is rare, occurring less than one in a hundred cases." It also says, "Cholera is caused by heat, as stated in the Neijing. Liu Shouzhen said, 'The triple burner is the pathway for water and grain transformation. If the heat qi is excessive, transformation will be abnormal, causing vomiting, diarrhea, and cholera. The nature of fire is restless, so it is like this.' Yet the likes of Xue Lizhai dared to base their theories on cold, misleading future generations. All who suffer from heat cholera are killed by these gentlemen." It also says, "Cholera belongs to heat, according to the Neijing. Liu Shouzhen said that the Sanjiao is the pathway of water and grain transformation, and when heat qi is excessive, the transformation is abnormal leading to vomiting and diarrhea. Fire is of restless nature, as a result Xue Lizhai and others dared to base their arguments on cold, misleading posterity. The book was written by Xu Qi in 1888. At that time, Koch had already confirmed that the comma bacillus was the cause of cholera, and Pfeiffer had already tried using live comma bacillus for immunization. Xu Qi still cited scriptures, arguing about cold and heat. The postscript says, "In the past, Wen Taizhen burned rhinoceros horns to illuminate water monsters, counting them one by one... this theory is not just as clear as illuminating water monsters." The inescapable truth is not whether cholera belongs to cold or heat.</p>
<p>Prevention and Environment</p>
<p>We usually describe a large number as "countless as the sands of the Ganges." However, the number of deaths from cholera epidemics that have spread from the center of the lower Ganges River to various parts of the world can be compared to the sands of the Ganges. We look back at history, hoping to learn lessons from history as a mirror. In modern Europe, except for a small part of the southeast, there have been few cholera epidemics. Even in Japan, the Dutch East Indies, Singapore, and the British Malay Peninsula, the harm of cholera is decreasing. This is due to the combined effect of preventive injections and environmental sanitation. However, only preventive injections without attention to environmental sanitation are only half effective. A clean environment coupled with prevention is of course even better. If we believe that disease enters through the mouth, then environmental sanitation is even more important. Currently, preventive injections are limited to cholera, a disease that everyone fears. Typhoid preventive injections are implemented by only a few, and dysentery prevention is even less effective.</p>
<p>If environmental sanitation is good and the health organization is strict, cholera is not to be feared. During the cholera epidemic in Europe, the epidemic was rampant in countries such as Berlin, Russia, Austria, and France. Berlin maintained commercial and transportation ties with the outside world, but cholera could not gain a foothold in Berlin. This fully illustrates the importance of environment and sanitary administration.</p>
<p>Drinking Water and Cholera</p>
<p>The author spares no effort in seeking details, and again cites historical facts to prove the above. In 1892, over 8,600 citizens of Hamburg died from cholera. At that time, Hamburg's drinking water was drawn from the Elbe River, but the city's drainage also discharged into the river. Due to tidal action, excrement flowed back upstream of the water source. Citizens' drinking water was first led to a pond for sedimentation, but there was no filtration equipment. As the city's population increased, the water demand also increased, so water was led to the reservoir, often without sufficient detention for sedimentation, and then used by citizens, resulting in many deaths from infection. At the same time, Altona, adjacent to Hamburg, also drew its drinking water from the Elbe River. All conditions were the same as Hamburg's, except that the drinking water had to be filtered through sand. However, only 328 people died from cholera. The following year, Hamburg added drinking water sand filtration equipment, and the epidemic was greatly reduced.</p>
<p>At this point, the author will describe the method of flies spreading germs to conclude. Cholera vibrio is extremely weak against dryness, and dies in ten minutes at 50 degrees Celsius. Therefore, the transmission of germs by the body, wings, and legs of flies is not important. However, cholera vibrio can survive in its intestines for several days. Flies mainly suck liquid and semi-liquid food. If they encounter solid food, they regurgitate liquid on the food, wait for the food to dissolve slightly, and then suck it up. Therefore, if its esophagus contains cholera vibrio, our food will be contaminated. Moreover, flies excrete their feces on food while sucking, so if this fly has stayed on the excrement of cholera patients and then stays on our food, our food may be infected with cholera bacteria. However, historical major cholera epidemics tell us that they are always due to water contamination. Flies may transmit some sporadic cases, but simply exterminating flies cannot prevent the spread of cholera. In summary, as long as we fully provide citizens with clean drinking water, fill in wells and ponds, remove garbage and excrement, and ban unsanitary food vendors, not only cholera, but other infectious diseases can be reduced to a minimum.</p>
<h3>The Latest on Streptomycin</h3>
<p>— Fu Kang</p>
<p>Today, many people are waiting for the supply of Streptomycin. Dr. Keefer of Boston, USA, said that,</p>
<p>as reported in the Journal of the American Medical Association, Dr. Keefer is now bringing this drug to physicians, saying:</p>
<p>"Its main interest… is to determine its effectiveness and toxicity in certain infectious diseases that are not curable by sulfonamides, penicillin, and other therapies… They have many diseases waiting for us to study."</p>
<p>Of the available Streptomycin, the National Research Council accounts for about 31%, with the remainder allocated to the Army, Navy, U.S. Public Health Service, and Veterans Administration.</p>
<p>For disease use, Streptomycin is currently used to treat typhoid fever, food poisoning, undulant fever, tularemia, certain genitourinary infections, blood poisoning, meningitis, pneumonia, bacterial endocarditis, while research on tuberculosis is limited.</p>
<h3>Anemia and Iron-Supplementing Medicine (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Zhang Changshao</p>
<p>(3) The Impact of Anemia</p>
<p>Everyone knows that blood is the most precious substance in the body. The nutrients needed by every cell in the body must be supplied directly or indirectly by the blood. However, the most important nutrient is not protein or vitamins; oxygen is the nutrient most needed by the body's cells. The more important the organ, the more indispensable oxygen is. Oxygen deprivation in the brain for a few seconds can lead to unconsciousness; oxygen deprivation in the heart for one or two minutes can cause it to stop beating.</p>
<p>Oxygen is absorbed from the lungs and transported throughout the body to various organs and tissues, entirely dependent on the red blood cells within the blood. As far as we know now, the most important function of red blood cells is carrying oxygen, and it is almost their only function. Anemia is a reduction in the number of red blood cells in the blood, so the oxygen-carrying capacity of anemic patients will naturally be reduced, inevitably leading to mild or severe hypoxia.</p>
<p>Because the brain and heart are the most susceptible to oxygen deprivation, these two organs are the first to be affected when oxygen is lacking. Therefore, the various symptoms of anemia are mainly the result of brain and heart hypoxia. Naturally, the hypoxia caused by anemia is relative, not absolute, so it does not lead to unconsciousness or cardiac arrest. Patients with very mild anemia may not feel any abnormalities themselves, but they become short of breath and have a rapid heartbeat more easily than normal people when climbing steep slopes or engaging in slightly strenuous exercise. Patients with somewhat more severe anemia feel physically weak and fatigued easily, and cannot recover quickly after fatigue. They naturally dare not join classmates in strenuous activities such as ball games and swimming. Even when going upstairs or walking a little faster, they pant heavily, and their heart feels like it is about to jump out of their mouths. These patients often feel dizzy, have tinnitus, and are prone to fainting. The ankles often have slight edema. As for patients with severe anemia, they easily become short of breath and have a rapid heartbeat even without exertion, and these symptoms are naturally even more severe during exertion.</p>
<p>If chronic anemia is not corrected, all tissues throughout the body will be affected by hypoxia, resulting in not only illness but also premature aging.</p>
<p>(4) Causes of Anemia</p>
<p>The lifespan of red blood cells is much shorter than that of humans. From generation to destruction, the average duration is only about three weeks. Under normal circumstances, old red blood cells in the blood are constantly destroyed and die, and new red blood cells are constantly generated. The bone marrow is where new red blood cells are produced. If there is any disease in the bone marrow, or if it is damaged by certain substances, the function of red blood cell regeneration often becomes impaired, leading to severe anemia. This type of anemia is called aplastic anemia, and there is currently no effective treatment. Patients often die quickly after contracting the disease. Fortunately, this type of anemia is very rare. People with poor complexion should not be overly suspicious or worry unnecessarily.</p>
<p>More than 99% of common anemia is due to the excessive loss of red blood cells, which the bone marrow cannot replenish in time. Chronic bleeding or repeated bleeding is the external loss of red blood cells; accelerated destruction causes the internal loss of red blood cells.</p>
<p>Patients with hemorrhoids, gastric ulcers, duodenal ulcers, etc., often unknowingly bleed repeatedly, leading to anemia. Patients with hemorrhoids often bleed slightly each time they defecate. Although the amount of bleeding is small each time, the cumulative amount over time is considerable. Bleeding from gastric ulcers and duodenal ulcers is very common, but in most cases, it is not vomited out but excreted through the stool, so patients often do not pay much attention. Ulcer patients who have black stools are a sign of bleeding and should seek immediate medical treatment to avoid dangerous massive bleeding.</p>
<p>Adult women are more prone to anemia than men because of menstruation. The total amount of blood loss during each menstrual period averages about two fluid ounces, totaling as much as twenty-four fluid ounces per year. If the diet provides sufficient nutrition, it will naturally be replenished quickly, preventing anemia. However, if there is malnutrition or excessive menstruation, anemia is likely to occur.</p>
<p>Intestinal parasites, especially hookworm disease, are also prone to causing anemia. However, roundworms are generally not a cause of anemia. Many mothers suspect roundworms (the most common intestinal worm) are the cause when they see their children have a "poor complexion," which is a misconception.</p>
<p>Accelerated destruction of red blood cells in the blood is medically known as hemolysis. Hemolysis is also a cause of anemia. Many infectious diseases, especially chronic malaria and pulmonary tuberculosis, often cause hemolytic anemia. This is because microorganisms secrete a substance that destroys red blood cells. Several toxins can also produce the same situation.</p>
<p>All the various types of anemia mentioned above have clear causes, and common anemia falls into this category. In addition, there is a type of anemia called pernicious anemia. The cause is unknown, and the condition is extremely severe. If left untreated, it often leads to death. This type of pernicious anemia is extremely rare in China. It is feared that it is difficult to find one case in ten thousand anemic patients, so we do not need to consider it.</p>

<h3>Saroyan</h3>
<p>— Cao Xizhen</p>
<p>There was an inconceivable thing in the American literary world, that is: Although there is a writer, he has won the respect and love of a wide readership; Although his works will spread quickly after publication, selling all over the world, and being translated into many languages; Although his works are so meaningful and powerful. However, the gift he received under the criticisms of American critics with different opinions was mixed praise.</p>
<p>Saroyan is already a familiar name among Chinese new literature readers. Countless of his short stories have been introduced to readers after being translated successively by Mr. Lu Shuxiang, Mr. Chen Yuan and the author, etc. And his best short story collection "My Name is Aram" and the novel "The Human Comedy" have also been translated by Mr. Lu Shuxiang and Mr. Liu Wugou respectively. (The former was translated by Kaiming Bookstore, and the book title uses one of the stories, "The Pomegranate Tree"; the latter was published by Wenguang Bookstore. It is a pity that both books were published in Chongqing before the victory, and Shanghai has not reprinted them after the victory. This is undoubtedly a pity for readers in Shanghai who love Saroyan.)</p>
<p>Saroyan, his parents were both Armenians, was born in Fresno, California, USA in 1908. He did not go to school or read any books properly. In his youth, he worked as a newspaper boy, a telegram delivery boy, and did odd jobs on farms to maintain his independent life. He wanted to become a writer when he was thirteen years old. At that time, he was a telegram delivery boy, working during the day and studying on his own at night, reading some novels and also started learning to write. He went to school for some time at the age of fourteen, but left school again at the age of fifteen, and since then bid farewell to school.</p>
<p>Saroyan's fate of submitting manuscripts, like the path experienced by most writers, is equally unfortunate. Despite sending out manuscripts one after another, they were always returned, being thrown into the wastepaper basket by the editor. Later, he felt that imitating the style of previous writers would always lead to failure. Therefore, he decided to create "Saroyan's own style." Sure enough, the novel "The Daring Young Man on the Flying Trapeze" in the "Saroyan style" was not only selected and published by the editor, but also appreciated by some critics, giving it positive reviews. (After that, he continued to write more than a dozen short stories and published a collection of short stories titled "The Daring Young Man on the Flying Trapeze", which is also his debut collection.) This kind of criticism encouraged Saroyan to move forward on the road of creating his own unique style, and the determination to write novels in the "Saroyan style" became even more firm.</p>
<p>The sales of his novels were not too bad, and a large sum of royalties provided him with travel expenses to the Soviet Union. The impression of the Soviet Union made him write the short stories "The Singer from Omsk" and "Russian Writer". These were later collected in a short story collection called "Peace, It's Wonderful!".</p>
<p>He is a prolific writer. Up to now, he has written more than 500 short stories. The published short story collections include "The Daring Young Man on the Flying Trapeze", "Inhale and Exhale", "Little Children", "Peace, It's Wonderful!", "Three Times Three", "My Name is Aram", and "The Trouble with Tigers". "The Human Comedy" is a novel. His most recent short story collection is "Dear Baby", and the novel is "Adventures of Wesley Jackson".</p>
<p>His novels are mostly autobiographical, mostly writing about his life as a newspaper boy, clerk, farm assistant, telegram delivery boy, and student in his youth and childhood, and some people he came into contact with in life. For example, the telegram delivery boy in "The Human Comedy" is a shadow of his childhood.</p>
<p>After 1938, he not only continued to write novels, but also began to try writing scripts. The scripts he wrote include "My Heart's in the Highlands", "Love's Old Sweet Song" and "The Time of Your Life". Among them, "The Time of Your Life" was the most successful, and won both the "New York Drama Critics' Circle Award" and the "Pulitzer Prize" for drama. His plays are all humorous comedies.</p>
<p>Because Saroyan's works have his own unique style, he does not devote himself to the embellishment and gorgeousness of rhetoric, does not pay attention to grammar, does not like to study structure and skills, and does not like pretentiousness; he just uses simple conversations and some of the most economical explanations necessary to connect the conversations, and incorporates his own planned theme, and then completes his style. Of course, this style has aroused a kind of bad or even malicious criticism from some conservative and specialized critics who specialize in formal integrity, which is also very natural. It is of course right to say that his works do not pay attention to grammar, rhetoric, skills, and structure. However, it seems unfair to completely obliterate the great achievements of his original style and simply say that Saroyan is not acceptable.</p>
<p>As for the personalities of the characters portrayed in Saroyan's writings, they are very simple, and sometimes one even doubts whether such simple characters exist in the world. However, these simple characters are very lovely, so lovely that they make people laugh and scream for help. From these characters, we can see Saroyan's understanding of love and hate, friends and enemies for mankind; and, it also reflects Saroyan's outlook on life and the world.</p>
<p>Saroyan is being vilified on the one hand, and praised by some more objective critics on the other hand.</p>
<p>Saroyan's initial criticism can be said to be completely similar to that of the great American democratic poet Whitman. Moreover, Saroyan, like Whitman, rarely cares about external criticism. Indeed, he has always continued to write in accordance with his style. Saroyan once replied to critics: "I have my own style. No matter how you criticize, I will always move forward on my established creative path." "All I want to say is a simple story, and I'll say it however I want. I don't understand the rules of rhetoric, and I don't understand the secrets of writing." In addition, his counter-criticism to critics is: "Maybe writers see farther than critics, maybe critics see farther than writers."</p>
<p>Saroyan's success today is none other than because he can create his own style and not be an imitator or follower of any writer. Yes, writers should create their own style!</p>
<p>During World War I, he was a newspaper boy. And this time during the war, in order to understand the war and enrich his life, he resolutely joined the army. After the victory last year, he has returned to the United States from Europe to continue his writing life. Saroyan did not disappoint readers, and his "Adventures of Wesley Jackson" is a masterpiece completed with war as the theme.</p>
<p>Saroyan is still young. His efforts will surely bring him richer harvests; to the readers, there will surely be more, more solid, and more abundant food for the soul. Saroyan will never disappoint readers, himself, and the times. He has the power of creation, and he has his own creative methods. — July 16, 1946.</p>
<h3>The Fog of Mountain City</h3>
<p>— Shi Bei</p>
<p>Fog, like love, plays on the heart of the mountain peaks, creating all kinds of beautiful changes. — Tagore</p>
<p>People who live in Chongqing will naturally appreciate the mystery of the fog. From August each year to April of the following year, this is the fog season. Misty and vast, like a fishing net cast into the vast sea before dawn, it envelops the sky, hills, houses, rivers, and is also attached to people's faces and hearts. Looking at this dense fog, it contains people's sorrows, anger, and hopes.</p>
<p>We often use the changes of fog to predict the weather: in the early morning, if we see waves of fog rising lightly and slowly from the surface of the Yangtze River and Jialing River, or from the small streams under the hills, gradually gathering into heavy fog, then the weather that day will definitely be sunny. However, if the early morning fog is sparse and scattered casually, that day will definitely be a day of light breeze and drizzle. At this time, a light mist floats on the river, and light rain dances obliquely in the fog, which is the true scene of "sails returning in misty rain" in the ancient books. However, this is completely different from the fog on a sunny day. I love the thick fog on a sunny day, because it is so thick and profound, like an impenetrable glass bead, but it also makes people yearn and guess. I also love the fog in the rain, because it is like light and soft gauze, like a bright dancing dress. From the vague and hazy isolation, you can glimpse the raindrops jumping in front of the window, and you can also look at the distant and faint returning sails from the window.</p>
<p>When the sky is filled with thick fog on a sunny day, the smoke from the houses mixed in the fog cannot be seen in the morning. The earth is locked in the fog. Running out of the house onto the street, it is impossible to see clearly beyond a distance of three or four feet. Cars coming and going are driving with their headlights on and honking their horns, moving slowly, sometimes even stopping to explore the way forward. Rickshaw pullers shout and yell, they walk even more slowly. From Lianglukou to Xiaoshizi, the road is relatively flat and straight, making it easier to walk, but it is necessary to be extra careful when passing through the lively Lianhua Street and the downhill and winding area of Shaanxi Road.</p>
<p>In the fog, the bustling sounds of the city are coming from ahead, but you cannot see the people moving. Standing on the towering city wall of Chuqimen, apart from hearing the noisy voices of the people in Haitangxi on the opposite bank and the clamor of the boatmen by the river, you cannot see anything else. At this time, you seem to feel like you are in a dream. Listening to the symphony of the busy, sad, and happy lives of the world, you will doubt whether the world is real or illusory!</p>
<p>At eight or nine o'clock in the morning, the sun hangs in the sky, but its light cannot overcome the obstruction of the fog, and it can only show its face like the moon. The sun is like moonlight, which is an interesting spectacle. The so-called "Sichuan dogs barking at the sun" is the situation at this time. Without the glare of strong light, we can raise our heads and stare at the sun, like appreciating the gentle and beautiful full moon. Until the sun is high in the sky, the sunlight gradually dissipates the fog. At this time, the sunlight completely shines on the ground, and the remaining fog on the river disappears like steam, but the white fog on the distant mountain peaks is still like silk ribbons that do not disperse.</p>
<p>When daytime passes, the fog follows the footsteps of the night and comes lightly.</p>
<p>The fog at night is a bit chilly. The street lights in the fog emit cold light, watching the dim night fog, moving silently. At this time, if you open the window, the fog outside will fight with the lights, and slowly it will want to flood the room, until the temperature in the room digests it into small water droplets, which are attached to the wall.</p>
<p>I remember that during the war, the people of Chongqing had to thank the fog for its grace, because during the more than half a year of the fog season, the fog protected the mountain city like an air defense net. Enemy planes did not dare to invade easily, and people could be free from the danger of air raids. This is the natural protection that fog built for Chongqing. Now, if you ask the people in the mountain city, they can still talk enthusiastically about the comfort of the fog season.</p>
<p>In addition to Chongqing being known as a famous fog city, London is also a world-famous fog city. It is said that the fog in London is yellow-ochre, but the fog in Chongqing has a clear, white, milky color. This is probably because London has many factories, and the air flow mixes with smoke, and the fog also mixes into a heavy yellow smoke. The surroundings of Chongqing, with hills and water, are almost entirely a green natural body, without too much turbid smoke from factories, so the fog still maintains a clear, floating, and light foam atmosphere.</p>
<p>The British all appreciate the fog in London and love the fog in London. They say that the reason why the British are particularly rich in steady political style and have a reserved and thoughtful character is due to the silent and subtle influence of the fog in London. Their poets also say that the fog can give them inspiration for reverie. They often chant the interest of the fog. Like this, the fog's influence on the British can be considered a kind of spiritual nectar. However, when we Chinese people talk about fog, we associate it with the gloomy and hateful side. This is not because we lack the wisdom of appreciation, nor is it because we are incompetent and cannot grasp the divine truth of fog, but because we only know how to live in peace in the fog, and use the obscurity of the fog to cover up other people's vision, secretly doing things that are not allowed to be shown in broad daylight. Therefore, many people are deceived and harmed, and the perpetrators can be free and at ease. So, we cursed the man-made fog every day, and gradually even the natural fog became the object of our disgust and curse.</p>
<p>Chongqing has had fog since ancient times, and this year and next year will be the same. Even in the infinite future, the natural fog will still come in the fog season, filling this mountain city. But whether our attitude towards fog is still as hateful as in the past depends on ourselves!</p>
<p>The fog season in the mountain city is coming soon. In the coastal city thousands of miles away, I can no longer see the soft fog shadow. I miss it, because I love the profound and magical white fog shadow spread on the earth!</p>
<h3>Old Man</h3>
<p>— Wang Shuyi (engraved)</p>
<h3>I Want to Be Strong</h3>
<p>— Zhongyuan</p>
<p>I have never told you this sentence; you must not have expected someone as weak as me to say this sentence; in the deep night, in the early morning, in the quiet dream, even I myself wonder how I can say such a sentence today. But I want to tell you that since you shone into my life like a strange light, and then disappeared suddenly like a flash in the pan, I have had this sentence in my heart: I want to be strong!</p>
<p>I do not deny often shedding tears for you on bleak rainy nights. I also do not deny that since that day, I hid your letters, hid your photos, hid the last bit of memory you gave me, in that broken little drawer. To this day, I still haven't dared to open that drawer. Calculating the days, it has been six months. But I want to tell you that in these six months, I finally used the shield of reason to resist the fierce attack of emotion, and I lived like before, and I am saying this sentence: I want to be strong!</p>
<p>Of course, I will always remember that small room, which is where I first met you. I will also always remember the many meetings with you eight years ago, in that quiet alley. I will even more always remember that once you looked at me with strange eyes, sighed silently, and left. However, although these painful memories are all vividly in front of my eyes, I hold my head high from the pain, shouting this sentence: I want to be strong!</p>
<p>I remember you once said to me that you would come to my place to see me. Now I am still dreaming that one day a sudden miracle will appear: you are standing in front of me again, smiling at me, looking at me. At that time, I might cry bitterly to you like a child, or I might stretch out my cold hands to hold you tightly. But I believe that in the end, I will wipe away my tears, let go of your hand, and say to you: "I want to be strong!"</p>

<h3>Double Birds, One Nest (96)</h3>
<p>— Zhao Qingge</p>
<p>"Mr. Dong!" Lihua called out softly.</p>
<p>Dong Shaoling was reading a book. He looked up and saw Lihua hesitantly walking in, and he quickly responded by standing up.</p>
<p>"Hey, Xiaohua! Why are you running out here alone so late? Is something the matter? Sit down and let's talk!" Dong Shaoling looked at Lihua's face, which was filled with a heavy air, and couldn't help but ask her in surprise, leading her into the room.</p>
<p>Lihua didn't sit down, nor did she speak. She stood blankly in front of Dong Shaoling's desk, occasionally sweeping Dong Shaoling with affectionate eyes.</p>
<p>"Why aren't you saying anything, Xiaohua! You look so unhappy. Are you angry with that rascal violinist again?" Dong Shaoling said, patting Lihua's shoulder kindly, as if coaxing a child.</p>
<p>Lihua remained silent, her mind seemingly elsewhere, gazing intently at Dong Shaoling's entire being, at all of Dong Shaoling's belongings; as if a sculptor were here, doing the work of engraving.</p>
<p>"What's wrong, Xiaohua? Are you angry with me?" Dong Shaoling asked, puzzled. He was starting to feel inexplicable.</p>
<p>"No, Mr. Dong!" Lihua finally opened her mouth.</p>
<p>"Then why are you so unhappy today? You're ignoring me and not even smiling at me." Dong Shaoling took her hand and said.</p>
<p>"I, I'm sad!" Lihua stammered.</p>
<p>"Why? Hey, you shouldn't be so pessimistic at such a young age! Be happier in the future, Xiaohua!" Huang Shaoling consoled her, stroking her.</p>
<p>"I, I… I'm leaving tomorrow!" Lihua finally choked out the knot of pain in her heart!</p>
<p>"Is it to Wuhan? I heard Mr. Liu say that she's going with you too," Dong Shaoling said without surprise.</p>
<p>"Mm!" Lihua turned her face away and cried!</p>
<p>"It's good to go to Wuhan, and you won't be lonely with Mr. Liu accompanying you. You'll see more places and gain more experience. You should be happy, so why are you sad instead?" Dong Shaoling walked over, lifted her chin, and patted her face, saying, "Are you sad to leave Kaifeng? Then come back when the war is over!"</p>

<h3>Face and Travel Expenses</h3>
<p>— Shaofu</p>
<p>A major incident in Shanghai has now entered a dead end!</p>
<p>I am an amateur when it comes to sports and have never had any contact with the sports world. Regarding the charity match incident of the South China team, which has turned from a deadlock into a stalemate, I, as a rational citizen with a sense of overall interest, cannot help but say a few words in indignation.</p>
<p>As the situation has evolved to the present—the South China team refusing to play due to not obtaining the consent of the Welfare Foundation, and Li Huitang about to lead the team back to Hong Kong—I believe that all the mistakes are the fault of the Municipal Sports Association. Why do I say this? It's not because the Municipal Sports Association is now "on the cross" and being "shown up," but because the Municipal Sports Association is too honest, believing that everyone is genuinely doing it for the sake of the victims in Xiangzhong and Northern Jiangsu!</p>
<p>Pitiful! The hungry people of Hunan, in the battlefield where they have been in and out seven times!</p>
<p>Pitiful! The people of Northern Jiangsu, who are still under the constant threat of gunfire, with their homes in ruins and wandering in ditches!</p>
<p>You, your countless eyes are watching that football, your lives are under the feet of others, and what can you do if they disdain to kick it?</p>
<p>If everyone were truly doing it for the victims, I believe there wouldn't be so many problems. Is there any basis for this? Yes, let me list a few quotes from the people involved as an index:</p>
<p>Chapter 1</p>
<p>Li Huitang: The five initiators invited the South China team to participate in the charity match "for convenience in coming to Shanghai," but Mrs. Sun among the five did not actually agree.</p>
<p>Rong Qizhao: You (the author notes: referring to Li Huitang) saw that the Welfare Foundation's affairs were deadlocked and once expressed your determination to comply with the Municipal Sports Association's intentions; now you have suddenly changed your mind and must seek the Welfare Foundation's consent. How can you justify yourself? The Municipal Sports Association originally did not want to hold the charity match but accepted the request of Mayor Wu and the other five "to make an exception" and preside over it.</p>
<p>Southeast Daily Report: If the Municipal Sports Association is willing not to insist on its "position," there is still a glimmer of hope to turn the tide. The separation lies in sports being sports, and the distinction between sports and legal orthodoxy.</p>
<p>Zhou Jiaqi: South China team captain Li Huitang visited me the other day and expressed his agreement in principle with the Municipal Sports Association's various measures; however, since South China was invited by the Welfare Foundation, the Football Committee should invite the Welfare Foundation in writing for consent before they can play, for the sake of "face."</p>
<p>Chapter 2</p>
<p>Mr. Fusheng of the Xinwenbao: The expenses for this charity match, even if necessary, must be minimized, and the "travel expenses" of the South China team should be strictly audited and paid. We are absolutely opposed to a gold-digging method of tens of millions.</p>
<p>Xinwenbao Report: The reporter also asked Mr. Li whether it was true that 35 million yuan in travel expenses had been remitted to Hong Kong before they left, as rumored. Li replied: It is true, but the amount is slightly different because the team's equipment and travel expenses were very large. This loss is the responsibility of the Welfare Foundation.</p>
<p>Dagongbao Report: According to Li Huitang, the expenses this time are very large, probably exceeding those of the Xingdong team's trip to Shanghai (the Xingdong team received 53.34 million yuan in travel expenses). Zhou Jiaqi replied that the Municipal Sports Association would be responsible for the legitimate travel expenses, which would be paid from the proceeds of the charity match, but the exact figures could not be predicted.</p>
<p>After reading the two chapters of the index, you, the intelligent reader, should be able to understand the situation. As for why the Municipal Sports Association sent a letter to Hong Kong to stop the South China team from coming to Shanghai, and why the South China team still crossed the sea to come, etc., there is no need to elaborate.</p>
<p>The "exception" that has been "broken," even if repaired, will still have scars. Alas!</p>
<h3>How Much is Mount Tai Worth? How Many People Rely on Mount Tai for a Living?</h3>
<p>— Dongfang Jing</p>
<p>For countless readers and moviegoers around the world, Tarzan is a handsome young man living in the African jungle, with a strong chest, never wearing clothes, only a cloth around his waist. He swings from tree to tree, fights wild beasts with his bare hands, protects the good, and punishes the wicked.</p>
<p>For the editors of "Publisher's Weekly," the Tarzan story is absurd and utterly criticized.</p>
<p>For the creator of this king of the jungle, Edgar Rice Burroughs, Tarzan is a good business.</p>
<p>Burroughs, unlike most writers, did not think his work would be immortal. He didn't even consider himself a writer, but rather a brilliant businessman who created a fictional character to make the most money in the publishing industry.</p>
<p>Burroughs has made $10 million from Tarzan. This includes royalties, film rights, radio rights, and comic strips in 200 newspapers, as well as many products using the Tarzan trademark, such as bread, ice cream cups, knives, toys, book bags, notebooks, bows and arrows, chewing gum, masks, forest costumes, etc.</p>
<p>Of these, three million are royalties from film companies making Tarzan films. Twenty-three Tarzan films have been made. Burroughs recently signed a contract with Smallville Company to lease them the film rights to Tarzan for a term of twenty years, for a rental fee of four million dollars. Burroughs' secret to making money is that he never sold the character "Tarzan," he only rents it.</p>
<p>Since 1923, Edgar Rice Burroughs, Inc., has been the sole owner of Tarzan.</p>
<p>The first Tarzan novel, "Tarzan of the Apes," was published in 1912 in a pulp magazine. Since then, Burroughs has written 55 best-selling novels, selling 35 million copies in 60 different languages. This is a miracle for someone who didn't start writing until the age of 36. And he initially wrote novels out of necessity, to support a wife and two children.</p>
<p>Burroughs is a tall, broad-shouldered man with a large, oval face, bald head, and brown skin; no one would believe he is 71 years old.</p>
<p>The latest Tarzan book, called "Tarzan and the Foreign Legion," was written two years ago, but due to the paper shortage, it will not be published until 1947.</p>
<h3>Terrible Leprosy!</h3>
<p>— Fang Jun</p>
<p>I have visited a leprosarium. The patients housed in the leprosarium are truly appalling. In various forms, there is no condition that is not present. Bent hands and feet, staggering movements, eyebrow shedding, swollen face and large ears with a peculiar skin color, are especially terrifying. This kind of suffering is extremely toxic and easily contagious, and is almost incurable. Modern medicine has not yet made effective inventions to deal with this, so people suffering from this disease eventually have no way to escape the sea of suffering. According to the patients themselves, the itching is bone-deep and cannot be scratched, so it is very difficult to endure, a hundred times more painful than death, perhaps because the bacteria have penetrated deep. Some say that this is a disease of extreme dampness and toxins. The symptoms of the disease seem to have a certain formula. It always starts with ringworm, which is unbearably itchy, gradually expanding and becoming leprosy. Whether this is the case, I have not studied it. But the attention that Cantonese people pay to ringworm may stem from this.</p>
<p>Although leprosy patients do not want to be isolated from the world, people will inevitably stay away from them, fearing them more than the plague. Therefore, rural areas in Guangdong deeply hate and detest patients with this disease. Once discovered, they must be forced to leave, otherwise they will be put to death without much pity. Taking my hometown as an example, there is a place where leprosy patients live in the whole county, called "Leprosy Mound," which is managed by someone and is extremely strict. Once committed, they cannot cross the line. However, patients who are admitted must first pay a fee and the payment must be cleared before they are allowed to enter the gate. Once inside, they can never come out for the rest of their lives. It is said that when leprosy patients leave home, they first turn the ancestral tablets upside down, tear open the roof tiles, and then go out, saying that this will prevent heredity. This is the general custom of rural areas for leprosy patients, and it is also to express the meaning of determination, not only with a superstitious nature.</p>
<p>In rural areas, in dealing with leprosy, patients who have money are sent to "Leprosy Mound" to spend the rest of their years. Patients without money are put to death. The method of execution is to force them to a designated remote mountain valley, give them strong wine mixed with opium juice to make them drunk, and then throw them into a deep pit dug in advance, immediately cover them with soil, and level it with the ground. This is called live burial. Although the method is cruel, it is a necessary measure for the safety of the villagers. As for the home of the patient, the roof tiles are removed and the doors are sealed, leaving it to be eroded by wind and rain and exposed to the scorching sun to eliminate the remaining toxins; and the nearby neighbors burn sawdust (i.e., wood bran) in front of their doors, filling the room with thick smoke, not daring to for the whole day, which is called disinfection.</p>
<p>In addition, there is a reward in rural areas for capturing leprosy patients. Anyone who sees patients who have escaped the above two methods of life and death and are living in the wilderness should be captured and killed immediately, and buried, with a heavy reward. The reason is that these patients have a strong desire to live, so they try their best to hide their traces so as not to be exposed (the villagers call it "not showing their face"). The best way to hide their traces is sex, sex between patients and non-patients, and eating the flesh of dead infants. Patients who escape into the wilderness are preparing for this method of treatment. If there are dead infants, they will steal them and cook them. If they encounter women, they will rob and rape them (women are seduced). Stealing dead infants and cooking them is certainly abominable, but raping women is not allowed by law and morality here. Because the person who is raped has already been infected, and after three days, they will also be a leprosy patient. Their cruelty is unforgivable, and the villagers must kill them precisely for this reason.</p>
<p>Patients with mild leprosy do not show their faces at first, but the villagers are very aware of this, as if they have a special eye. If they are discovered, people will secretly place banyan leaves and banyan roots in the well. Once patients with mild leprosy accidentally drink it, the poison will be released, with large ears, eyebrows falling out, swollen face and bent fingers, body itching, and soles of the feet ulcerating. At this point, there is no way to hide it, and their homes must be destroyed.</p>
<p>Leprosy can also be cured if treated before it occurs. A villager once walked in the mountains at night and saw a beautiful girl (i.e., a mild leprosy patient who seduced men), taking advantage of her loneliness, and had sex with her. He returned and realized the danger and was very afraid; but he was quite knowledgeable in medicine, so he hurried to the cowshed, took a bullock, killed it and cut open its abdomen, removed all the intestines, and while it was still hot, nakedly entered the abdomen and asked his family to cover him. But his body was too large and the abdomen was too small, so he could not fit completely, and one hand stretched out of the abdomen. After a day and a night like this, the poison was completely removed. Three days later, there was nothing unusual except that the hand outside the bullock's abdomen had not been completely cleared of poison, and the tendons suddenly contracted, and the five fingers were bent inward and could not be stretched again.</p>
<p>Leprosy is the most terrible disease. Cantonese opera also describes it. Now Cantonese actor Liao Xiahuai performs this kind of satirical drama, which is called his signature piece, entitled "Local Top Scholar" (Cantonese people call being infected with leprosy "winning the local top scholar"), which vividly depicts this kind of life.</p>
<p>[Editor's note: The above descriptions of leprosy are mostly rural rumors. Whether they are in line with medical principles remains to be studied by experts.]</p>
<h3>Epidemic Hospitals are Overcrowded, Where Should Cholera Patients Go? Only 1.35 Million Out of 3.7 Million Citizens Have Been Vaccinated.</h3>
<p>— Bai Jun</p>
<p>Today, when cholera is raging in Shanghai, all the epidemic hospitals in the city are full of patients. There are no empty wards or empty beds. Large numbers of patients are constantly pouring in every day, wanting to be hospitalized, but there is nowhere to accommodate them. They can only be injected with a life-saving injection and then carried home. This is truly the biggest crisis facing Shanghai today!</p>
<p>According to the announcement of the Epidemic Prevention Committee on the 14th, there are a total of 1,892 cholera patients, including previous cases, and 133 deaths. If these large numbers of sick people still cannot be accommodated, I think the spread of cholera will further expand, and the death toll will also increase. Currently, 1.35 million people have been vaccinated, but Shanghai's population is more than 3.7 million. How can the vaccination work be quickly expanded for the remaining 2.35 million people? And on the other hand, how to increase the capacity of epidemic hospitals? This is truly an urgent matter!</p>
<p>Here, I will offer a few small suggestions:</p>
<p>(1) Increase the number of epidemic prevention working groups. The current 20 teams should be increased by 10 or 20 more teams.</p>
<p>(2) Compulsory vaccination. Anyone who wants to take a train, car, tram, ship, plane, or enter public places such as cinemas, theaters, dance halls, and cafes must have a vaccination certificate.</p>
<p>(3) Working groups should be densely distributed in the suburbs to vaccinate the poor in the lower classes.</p>
<p>Everyone knows these things, but only heaven knows how to do them! Let's talk about the vaccination certificate. Many are issued casually, and the certificate holders have not been vaccinated. Therefore, the implementation of many measures still requires the authorities to strictly enforce them, and the people are deceiving themselves!</p>
<h3>Rising Step by Step, Retreating Step by Step</h3>
<p>— Xin Yun</p>
<p>If you observe carefully, you will find the following situation: In elementary school, at the end of the semester, the first, second, and third places are mostly girls. Then, in junior high school, the first, second, and third places are mostly occupied by boys, while girls are after the fourth or fifth place. When you look at high school, it's even worse. Girls' rankings are often among the last few. Of course, there are also many girls who get first place in high school, but the above situation is very common. Why is this the case? Find the answer yourself!</p>
