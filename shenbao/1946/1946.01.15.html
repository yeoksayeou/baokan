<h3 id="c1">四次會中孫科等提議　擴大國府容納各黨　會員有熱烈廣泛討論 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>〔中央社重慶十四日電〕政治協商會議，十四日下午三時，舉行第四次會議，議題爲（一）政治類（甲）項政府組織問題。政府代表孫會員科等八人，對此問題，提出關於擴大國府組織之意見。靑年黨代表曾會員琦等五人，亦提出改革政治制度實行政治民主化案。今日會議中對以上兩種方案，僅作廣泛討論。出席會員郭沫若等三十四人，會議仍由孫會員科任主席。六時十分散會，明日上午舉行五次會，繼續討論。</p>
<p>〔中央社重慶十四日電〕政治協商會議第四次會議中，國民黨代表孫會員科等八人，提出關於擴大國府組織之意見如下：中國國民黨在國民大會未舉行以前，爲準備實施憲政起見，擬修改國民政府組織法，以充實國民政府委員會。其修改要點如左：（一）國民政府委員，就原有名額，增加三分之一。（二）國民政府委員廿人，由主席聘請選任黨外人士充任之。（三）國民政府委員會，爲政治之最高指導機關。（四）國民政府委員會，討論及議決之事項如左：（甲）立法原則，（乙）施政方針，（丙）軍政大計，（丁）財政計劃及預算，（戊）主席交議事項，（己）委員三分之一以上連署提出之建議事項，（五）國民政府主席，對於國民政府委員會之決議，如認爲執行困難時，得提交覆議，覆議時如有三分之二以上委員仍主張維持原案，該案應予執行。（六）遇有緊急情形時，國民政府主席得爲權宜之處置，但應予處置後報吿國民政府委員會。此外，同時修改行政院組織法如左，行政院置政務委員若干人，政務委員得兼任各部會長官。孫科·吳鐵城·陳立夫·張羣·邵力之·張厲生·陳布雷·王世杰。</p>
<p>〔本報重慶十四日電〕王世杰報吿政府對擴大政府組織意見提商中，表現政府黨準備還政於民，及容納各黨賢達參加政府決策及執行，一面將國府委會擴大，並加强職權，代替國防最高委員會權力，作還政初步。一方在國大任務及會期未定前，不提及參會地位，以作審愼考慮協商。張東蓀認政府組織問題討論前，政府對主席開會日四諾言，而立有明確證實有碍人民自由法令，二三日內即行廢止或修改。梁漱溟更激烈主張政府如不能辦到，則不能討論。政府改組問題，咄咄逼人，造成不良印象，邵力子謂國防會今晨開會，已通令十日內廢止或修改各種有　出版集會自由各種指令，政治犯則於七日內查明釋放，陳布雷向不輕易發言，聞張梁言起謂：政府歷年因戰事而限制自由各種設施，均已因戰事結束，分別查明廢止或修正，但以中國之大，情形之複雜，若迫於二三日內辦竣，不能確實，反失原意。若以此爲討論政府改組之條件，恐亦影響協商之進行，必非人民之之福祉等語。平心靜氣，根據事實，顯映政府之誠意，極得會衆稱讚。然周恩來繼起慷槪質問楊虎城張學良二件，張厲生則堅決答復：，如係以黨員立塲，則必有決心與勇氣奉答：惟以顧及政府之立塲爲會議之順利和諧進行，則本席不願重提舊惡，不欲有所答復。詞嚴色正，舉塲肅然動容，此一風波始吿了結，會義乃得繼續。</p>
<h3 id="c2">協和醫院中空氣協和　調處部展開工作　希望於三兩週內順利完成 <a href="#c2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>〔本報北平十三日電〕銀色的「九一四八」號美軍機，今日下午四時，載來十二位和平使者。羅賓遜看雪靑色西服，態度謙冲謹嚴，除了說他到過北平外，關於他的任務和計劃，沒有發表任何談話。他準備在一個正式的集會上，正式招待記者。鄭介民廳長有問必答，充滿一片祥和之氣。他說：停止衝突是絕對的。他坐飛機來，預備坐火車回去。記者問停止衝突恢復交通要多少時間可以完成，他的回答是：這談判九年未決的問題，希望在二三週內全部完成。葉劍英不如想像瘦削英俊，反像一個和事的小胖子。嘴上有一抹短鬚，穿最流行的腰中束黃細呢軍服，外罩藍呢大衣。據說：他和鄭廳長還是第　一次來北平，他也說中共絕對奉行停止衝突恢復交通的命令，不打折扣。他希望分離的華北城市與鄕村，今後能再合攏在一起。從他的談話裏，透露三人小組中共已推周恩來出席，國府方面人選未定。另外一位代表，也可能改由協商會另推中立人士担任。因爲自己能解決的問題，還是不麻煩盟友。他們都住在北京飯店，羅賓遜住三層樓十二號，鄭介民住二層樓十九號。</p>
<p>〔本報北平十三日電〕羅賓遜，鄭介民，葉劍英，將在北平協和醫院協和之空氣中，從事醫治華北在軍事衝突中所受之創傷，鄭氏希望全部工作，能在三二週，甚至一二週內，順利完成。他說；雙方已經談判九年了，再不解決，我們要談老了。軍事調處執行部，國共美各一五零人，共四五零人。今日僅來十二，計美方三，國府四，中共五。全部人員，將於二十五日前，完全到達北平，辦公地點，此間已代擇協和醫院。至如何辦公，三氏明日將初步交換意見。記者詢鄭葉，最近是否到別處視察，鄭答：等待命令。葉答：在北平看看再說。大致在軍事調處執行部下，將視需要，設若干分站。軍事調處執行部本身機構，將分秘書，聯絡，執行三組。秘書聯絡兩組人選未定，執行組美方爲白魯德，國府爲蔡文治，中共代表未定。軍事調處執行部三委員，各有一表決權，所有決議，必須三人一致同意，遇有分歧不決，應依停止衝突恢復交通命令條文辦理。該部對戰區雖無直接約束權，但所有命令，皆以國府主席名義出之，對國軍及共軍，皆可直接命令。</p>
<p>〔本報北平十三日電〕鄭介民在此答記者問，頗多不算舊賬之語。葉劍英發言，亦少刺激。一片和祥之氣，充盈于軍事調處執行部三委員間。實預兆停止衝突恢復交通顯有極大希望。記者曾問及軍事調處執行部之任務，有處理受降一事，作何解釋。鄭答：受降工作，必以遣送僑歸國爲其終的。目前受降雖大部已吿完畢，而此種工作，尙未完成，故謂處執行部任務到此一項。葉對此受降問題，亦認爲業成過去，該部目前之主要工作，爲停止衝突恢復交通，遣送日俘，至全國軍隊之改編集中調遣等，則歸三人小組。三人小組除國共外，原由美方担任一員，但今日葉表示，中國問題，最好自己解決，此次協商會議，或將有新決議，原由美方參加之一員，可能改由中國中立人士担任。</p>
<p>〔本報北平十三日電〕葉劍英說：在北平上空繞了一週，覺得很好。這是共產軍的智囊，對北平的第一次印象。他還是第一次來北平，說自己是個土豹子。對於政治協商會議的成果，他不作判斷，只說大家都是有誠心的。他並且保證中共軍隊絕對遵照停止衝突恢復交通命令。有一位記者問：如果某縣行政人員，到政令普遍的地方，雙方是否會發生衝突。葉氏含混的說，今後要實行地方自治的，小的衝突，也不敢保證其必無。有人說到北平籠城人民生活的痛苦，葉說，現在是鄕村包圍城市，將來鄕村與城市打成一片就好了。</p>
<p>〔本報北平十三日電〕熱河方面情勢，刻仍不詳。十一戰區呂副參長文貞語記者：長官部昨是接到停戰命令，當即轉發遵照。平熱綫上國軍，仍在石匣古北口間。熱河境內，情勢不詳。並云：昨今兩日，仍有共軍出擾，哈山附近，共軍仍趕作工事。鄭介民答記者問：彼十一日在渝所接情報，國軍係在凌源一帶，因交通遲滯，停戰命令或有未能如期送達者，但政府必使所有國軍，切實執行停止衝突命令。</p>
<p>〔合衆社北平十四日電〕軍事調處執行總部工作人員，今晨準備開始其停止華北戰爭之艱鉅任務。三委員或將舉行會議，討論華北局勢，據葉劍英昨向記者稱：渠不信國民黨代表前往共產區視察，將有若何困難。</p>
<p>〔又電〕執行總部三委員，允於一二日內發表聯合聲明。</p>

<p>〔中央社重慶十四日電〕政治協商會議第四次會議中，王會員世杰，對於政府組織案有所說明，其槪要如次：</p>
<p>中國國民黨代表同人所提擴大政府組織案，已有書面印發各位，在說明本案之前，先報吿我們的幾點基本觀念。第一，我們認爲政府機關組織，應該擴大，俾能容納國民黨以外之人士在政府機關以內。第二，我們覺得容納國民黨以外人士之機關，應不以政府最高決策機關為限，即執行機關，亦可容納黨外人士。蔣主席元旦廣播中，亦有宣示。第三，擴大組織的制度，究竟是一個從現在到憲政實施前的過渡制度，所以不能不法律事實同時兼顧。所謂顧到事實，在使此制度與未來憲政制度更接近；所謂顧到法律，即在此過渡時期，不要根本動搖法律的系統。我們本以上三個原則，擬定這個擴大政府組織的方案。我們擴大國民政府組織的方案，共計六項：</p>
<p>（一）國民政府委員會委員，就原有名額增加三分之一，現有國民政府委員三十六名，再增十二名，共爲四十八名。</p>
<p>（二）國民政府委員，得由主席提請選任黨外人士充任。所謂選任，就是由國民政府主席提經國民黨中央執行委員會通過。這種手續，國民大會未召集前，一律保持，否則法律的系統，也就變更。但在人選方面，旣然今日要容納國民黨以外人士，自須先徵各方意見，而後提請選任。至於名額分配，在法律亦無法規定，尤其在現在情形之下。如勉强爲明文之規定，必致引起不必要的爭執，反於事無補。分配與人選，如何規定，可待辦法通過後，政府與各方商量後解決。惟有一點，本人必須附帶聲明，在座各位，都承認國民黨是參於領導地位的大黨，如果國民黨委員的名額，僅僅是比較任何他黨的名額多，而不具某特定程度的多數，國民黨便不能履行領導的責任。</p>
<p>（三）「國民政府委員會爲政治之最高指導機關」，這條是一個抽象的規定。這個委員會的實在權力，在下一條內明白的具體的規定了。</p>
<p>（四）國民政府委員會職權有六項：甲，議決立法原則。過去十多年來，這個機從前在中央政治會議，後來在國防最高委員會。這個職權的意義，是一切法律案的原則，由國府委員會決定，決定後交立法院根據原則制定法律。修改法律時亦同。乙，議決施政方針。凡是政府大政方針，過去都先經中央政治會議，或國防最高委員會討論決定，即每兩週的軍事外交報吿，報吿以後，會中如認爲有討論議決必要，亦可討論議決。丙，議決軍政大計。關於軍政，現在係由行政院與軍事委員會分管，但國防最高委員會，得對於軍政爲一切的與最後的決定。所調議決軍政大計之權，意即指此。丁，議決財政計劃及預算。政府每年國家預算，以及其他財政計劃，現在都由國防最高委員會核定，這裏改爲提到國民政府委員會來決定。戊，主席交議事項。以上五項，是國民政府委員會行使的。在這裏，我要向諸位先生說明的，就是本方案沒有將用人權，選任用各部會長官之權，列入國民政府委員會職權之內。就政治效能着想，我們不能將這種職權列入，用人的權最高級是選任，選任權向來不由國防最高委員會行使。至於各部會次官，以及各省政麻人選，向來係由行政院決定，將來黨外人士如果參加行政院，自宜參加該項用人權之行使。至於各部會長官之任用，就民主國家的例子言，亦多不提請議會通過。英國就是最顯著的例十。就中國情形言，如果負責任的行政院長，每用一個部長，都要先行提交國民政府委員會討論，批評，在院長固難於負責，愛惜聲名的人，也許不願意出而擔任部會長官。自然政府中也許因此有不當的人選，但是這一層，亦有補救，因爲我們的方案尙有「已」的一項，即委員可以三分之一以上連署，提出任何議案。那末，部會長官如有不職的情形，自然可以根據「己」項擬出罷免，或其他糾正的案。我們覺得不僅在此過渡時間，關於用人權的辦法，只能如此，就是將來憲法，對於行政院部會長官的任用，在原則上，恐也只能如此。</p>
<p>（五）國民政府主席，對於國民政府委員會之決議，如屬爲執行有困難時，得提交覆議，覆議時如有三分之二以上委員，仍主張維持原案，該案應予執行。這一款的意義，並未以絕對否決權給予主席，同時國民政府主席也不是一個所謂「統而不治」的主席，有如英國的元首一樣。這一款的制度，可以說是採自美國的。</p>
<p>（六）遇有緊急情形時，國民政府主席，得爲權宜之處置，但應於處置後，報吿國民政府委員會。在目前情形，對外難免不有緊急情事發生，在緊急情事發生時，主席不能不有緊急處分之權。最後一條，是行政院設置政務委員若干人，政務委員得兼任各部會長官。這一條，在使國民黨以外人士，並得參加執行機關。至於政務委員之名額，以及是否兼部會長官，自不宜作硬性規定，可讓未來事實的需要來決定。</p>
<p>在這方案上，我們沒有提到國民參政會，沒有提到的原因，是這回的國民大會，任務如何，尙待明定。國民大會的任務，究竟是制憲，還是行憲，尙待確定。如果五月五日召集國民大會，而且該會同時制憲行憲，則國民參政會問題，或可不必多討論，否則國民參政會的地位，自須鄭重考慮。我們準備於國民大會的任務有了決定之時，對國民參政會問題，再提出意見。（完）</p>

<p>〔美國新聞處華盛頓十三日電〕美國海軍部今日公佈一九四六年美國艦隊之部署計劃，據美國海軍部長福萊斯特爾十一日舉行記者招待會時宣稱：海軍部業已參照現代海軍組織之複雜問題，而求適應其需要。參加海長記者招待會者，尙有海軍作戰部長尼米茲元帥及海軍部次長等。福萊斯特爾稱：海軍之戰　計劃，業已反映於海軍作戰部次長之使命中。所有海軍之作戰武器，特別着重於航空潛艇，兩棲作戰及研究方面之注意。海軍將利用第二次大戰中之經騐與敎訓，並將經騐應用於實際計劃，試騐以及平時之訓練。渠又稱：「海軍對於航空向極注意，惟同時則絕未不顧或過渡重視海戰中之其他因素，一切海軍武器，必需加以繼續改良。」吾人戰後之海軍，必需將各種構成海軍之原素，合而爲一，使其現代化，而極其優秀。目前任命對於航空，潛艇，兩棲作戰與武器改良方面，當有經騐軍官之舉，即係最初之步驟。尼米茲將軍宣佈一九四六年大西洋與太平洋之海軍計劃稱：該項計劃，旨在支持美國之外交政策，以及歐洲與太平洋西部佔領軍隊，同時將完成海軍復員，並協助陸軍之復負工作，此外將訓練戰後之海軍。</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓十三日電〕海軍部今日宣佈，美國在戰後將保持七個艦隊，共計軍艦一千零七十九艘，其中三百十九艘爲現役艦，七十三艘爲預備艦，六百八十七艘，停留國內，此七個艦隊分配如下：三隊駐大西洋，三隊駐太平洋，一隊駐地中海及歐洲海面。太平洋艦隊總部仍設珍珠港，前任太平洋艦隊司令史普郞斯上將遺缺，將由托華斯上將繼任。據海軍部稱：每個洋面中各艦隊所有軍艦將循環調動。爲訓練人員起見，並將依照其他需要，訪間外國。海軍軍令部長尼米茲上將已有高級軍官九人襄助，曾在第一次會議中，按照現時編制，宣佈海軍行政方針。據稱：美海軍戰後政策，可由選任副軍令部長一事反映之。各式海軍兵器中，尤着重飛機潛艇水陸作戰及研究方面。美海軍擬完全利用第二次世界大戰中所獲經騐，並擬使此項經騐加入實騐計劃及平時演習戰術。</p>

<p>〔中央社華盛頓十三日路透電〕美海軍作戰部副部長勃朗蒂少將今日吿記者，謂美陸海空軍夏季將聯合舉行原子彈爆炸力對軍艦及海面海底艦艇之影響之試騐，倘得海軍作戰部長尼米茲之同意，或將同時舉行無人駕駛火箭之試騐。</p>

<p>〔美國新聞處紐約十三日電〕據紐約時報記者皮爾斯稱：汽車工程師恊會上週在第特律城舉行會議時，曾預測五年之內，原子能即可用於商業用途。據前任哥倫比亞大學研究所所長鄧寗博士稱：「根據商業上應用原子能研究之進展，原子能用於大發電廠，運輸船隻，飛機，噴氣，推進機與火箭，似有可能，惟余目前猶不信原子能，可以用於發動汽車，蓋用以保護原子能放射力量者，至少需有五呎至十呎之空間。「原子能似尙不致在多數應用方面完全代替普通之燃料，惟將作爲現有之各種燃料之補充」。「獲得廉價原子能已有希望，由於使低級物質與U—二三五一同燃燒，可能減低原子能之生產成本。「吾人目前僅有淺薄之收獲。目前折合成本，U—二三五每磅需費五萬二千美金，而航空汽油每加侖，不過需費二角，如與煤炭相較則U—二三五每磅需要九千美金，而每噸煤炭則僅需美金六元，目前最迫切之問題，爲如何可以有效利用其高溫，所幸者，原子能可以在低溫時予以應用，而多數之工業應用，毋需濃度甚高之U—二三五。換言之，該項物質並非存在於高度爆炸情形之下」云。</p>
<p>〔聯公社華盛頓十三日電〕聯會國　構總部的設置，已經在華盛頓引起許多問跑，總部永久地址雖已決定設在美開東海岸紐約或波士頓附近，但是究竟需要多少經費，需要房屋若干，多少時候可以完成，這些問題現在還不能準確的答覆。有人猜測建築費用或許要二千五百萬美元，或許還要多些。這是根據下述事實而言：日內瓦的國際聯盟會所造價約費一千萬美元，建造的時候適値一九三〇年前後的不景氣時期，那時瑞士的工價遠較美國爲低。但在今後數年中，美國原料的價格和工資，大約都很高，而且聯合國機構所需要的屋宇，也比舊時的國聯爲冬。國聯主要的屋宇只有五座，即辦公廳·大會堂·會議廳·圖書館及秘　處·聯會國機構要多少座屋宇，還沒有人知道，但勢必比舊時的國聯需要更多的地位。國聯會員國最多的時候有五十大國，在它尋終的時候只剩四十五國，而參加聯合國議構的現有五十一國，將來可望增加到六十國。聯合國機構的工作，其範圍也遠比國聯的廣泛，所以無疑需要更多的當任職員。國聯所有的職員，連高級的科學和經濟顧問及秘書在內，最多時也只七百個人。聯合國大會即將決定總部的永久會址，並遣派一設計委員會，進行會所的設計工作。按照現定計劃，這個委員會至　須於一九四七廿　出最後建議，會所的興建，即當隨之動工，所需費用將由各會員團按照比例分担。各國建築師恐又將在聯合國機構的指導下，竸爭屋宇式樣的選擇，像從前在日內瓦建築　部時一樣，等到圖樣打好，一切預備工作舒齊之後，接着發生的問題，就是建築道些屋字要多少時候。各種不同的猜測似都有理由，所以說不出一個大槪的時期。舊日的國聯，是一九一九年在倫敦開始工作，日內瓦總部的屋宇，是在一九二九年奠基，但直到一九三六年才全部落成。其室內裝飾大部份是由各會員國捐輸，此在各國正是絕好的宣傳機會。他們的藝術像具等等，都得藉此誇示於世人，這種辦法在聯合國機構或仍可採用，日後的維持費也可依舊由各會員國負担。此外還有許多枝節的問題，譬如聯合國總部人員，在美國境內是否享有治外法權，像外國駐美的大使公使一樣。按照現行外交慣例，駐在國對於外國的大使公使，不能以債務向其起訴，或以謀殺案將其逮捕，只有其本國政府才有權出此。</p>

<h3 id="c38">政府與共黨代表　會談之四階段　邵力子周恩來兩會員向三次協商會報告詞 <a href="#c38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>第一報告（續完）　邵力子</p>
<p>各位先生和新聞記者看了會談四個階段的經過，對於參加雙方的有無誠意，可以作一個判斷。參加會議的人，沒喲敢偷懶，也可以看出。周先生以說到會議中的成就，特別市對於政治協商會議的決定，在政治協商會議這一問題上，所費會談的時候，幷不算少。在我們會談的　慣和技術上，要求速效，實在不容易，不過，大家都有要求問題解決的意見，所以費的時間雖然多，卻幷非耽擱或有意拖延。會談沒有公開，祗每天發了一個　單的消息，是雙方認爲有此必要。因爲要在會談中，培養良好的情緒，避免不必要的刺激。我們在會談中，是無話不說。有時也爭到面紅耳赤，甚至筋脈憤張，但不久即能恢復到和諧的情緒。假若談話情形公開，也許有人斷章取義，驟加指摘，就會影響會談者的心理。在會談時，有了拘束，不敢盡量發言，所以雙方約束到有結果時候，一定將內容公布於社會，而在會談中則暫不發表，會談的每項問題，可以說全在會談紀要以內。有未發表之點，亦經雙方同意，我今天不妨略加說明，藉以消弭某一種的誤解。例如：會談紀要發表以後，軍事衝突隨之發生，並且日益擴大，這是不是會談時沒有考慮到呢？我要說明的：會談紀要初稿，原有十三項，最後一項的原文，是關於避免衝突問題，中共方面，提出停止一切武裝衝突，自須即行停止，祗要中共部隊對中央軍隊之行進，不加阻止，則無問題，這因爲共黨最初要求停止進兵，中央即明白答覆，中央部隊爲受降前進，中共不應阻止，最後紀要稿，上面所說的文字，到會談紀要快要發表的時候，共黨主張刪去這一項，中央代表同意，當時是不願引起全國人民心理的不安，原希望紀要發表以後快快繼續商談，把各種問題都得到解決，軍事衝突自然可以沒有。後來會談進行遲緩，軍事小組更未舉行，當時是沒有預想到的。</p>
<p>相讓為國　雙方各有立場</p>
<p>會談中間堅持的事項，亦即紀要中的第十項，我們一看就知道這問題還沒有解決，但就是這一項，我們也承認共黨方面有其立塲與讓步之點，而中央也並非完全不接受共黨的意見，如各級政府民選一點，政府代表曾說過，自縣到行政督察區，可同意。在會談紀要裏，也已寫明「縣級民選加委，中央可以考慮，至省級民選一點，須待憲法頒布省的地位以後，方可實施」。從道些地方可以看出，兩方多有讓步，同時兩方各有其立塲。在政府方面是軍令政令統一，這一點特別不能放棄，在會談中，政府方面沒有先提出具體方案，這或者要受良心的責備與朋友們的責備，我們沒有在會談中爭取主動，但我們是樂於接受這種責備的。爲什麼政府方面不自動先提方案呢？這有很重要的理由。</p>
<p>和藹空氣　政府始終培養</p>
<p>在抗戰勝利以後，蔣主席邀請毛澤東先生的電報，已將政府的希望充分說明，我們祇希望聽取共黨的意見，倘若政府先提具體方案，也許使共黨方方認爲政府已有一種定見，而有碍會談的進行。共黨最初提出十一點意見，政府即就所提的各條，逐一答　，會談紀要發表條目上，雖稍有變更，大體是以共黨最初所提的十一項爲根據，從這一點，更可以看出政府始終培養和靄空氣，尋求問題解決的誠意。講到兩方讓步之點，有許多事項，可以看出。在討論實際問題開始時，周恩來先生即說明，此次共黨準備讓步，不堅持前年十二月和去年一月間所提條件，如黨派會議，聯合政府，聯合統帥部等問題，所以在政府答覆十一問題時，凡是政府認爲應該同意的，應該容受的都立刻接受，凡是認爲要再考慮的也都坦白的說明其理由，會談紀要已有解決辦法，而尙待實施的軍事問題，也是變方都有讓步的結果，如中共軍隊縮編爲廿個師的數目，雙方讓步的情形十分明白，中央最初允將共黨部隊整編爲十二個師，因爲在卅二年時共戴祇要求編十個師至十二個師。卅三年時，共黨也祇要求編六個軍，十五個師，這次共黨最初要求四十八個師，最後折衷爲二十個師，實在是雙方讓步的明證。</p>
<p>政令軍令　政府堅主統一</p>
<p>中央堅決希望做到的，也是國人共認爲重要的，就是軍令政令必須統一的問題，祗要軍令政令統一，一切問題都可商量解決，本人始終相信，雙方都有誠意解決問題，其尙未能讓步之點，因各有其不能讓步的立塲，但決非始終不能互讓解決。在這次會談中間，實已解決了許多問題，即如召開政治協商會議，在會談紀要發表時，已商定大體辦法，所以十月廿日重新會談，此問題所費的時間，並不很多，又如國民大會問題，我們聽過毛澤東先生的意見，也知道他有讓步的精神，當然有關於這一問題的種種，還要待政治協商會議解決。最後，本人以政府代表的立塲，對赫爾利將軍所予雙方代表會談的助力與熱烈的情緒，表示不能忘懷；尤其是他將離重慶最後兩天的努力，更使我們感動，今日乘報吿之便，特別提出，藉示感佩之意！（中央社重慶十三日電·全文已完）</p>
<p>第二報告（續完）　周恩來</p>
<p>中共方面提出十一項提要，然後政府代表逐項加以書面的答復。在彼此商談中，已經得到同意的紀錄下來，沒有得到同意的繼續商談，以後遂有雙十節政府與中共代表會談紀要的簽定。其中還有幾個主要問題，彼此認爲不必發表，因其尙未解決，要留待以後商量的，例如：關於進兵問題，政府軍隊要求開赴一切敵佔地區受降，中共方面則要求有些原來由中共領導的武裝在那裏活動，已經解放了的敵佔地區，或是已由中共領導的武裝包圍的敵佔地區，希望在受降問題解決之前，雙方部隊都暫駐原地不進，因彼此未能同意，所以會談紀要沒有列入。很淸楚的，會談紀要公布後，繼續衝突的擴大，其根源即在於此，就已經公布的十二項中，也可以看出。在此時期中，是從一般的方針談到具體的問題的，而一般方針的解決，我們始終認爲是雙十會談紀要的主要成功，因爲由抗戰轉入和平，兩黨方面都認為要確立基本方針，然後和平建國的事業才能有所遵循，所以毛先生向　蔣主席首述這個方針，得到　蔣主席的同意和贊許，這個方針在會談紀要中的第一項，已經宣布了。我相信到今天，還是不可更易的，也常賴有此方針，使得過去幾個月發生的不幸衝突，不能再繼續下去，而停止了。正因爲有了一個方針的確立，進入具體問題的商談，方能收到不少協議，如同會談紀要，第二項的政治協商會議，便已在此開會。第四五六七八五項的人民權利及地方自治等問題，前天又得到　蔣主席重複一次宣布，第九項是關於軍隊問題，中共方面提出關於全國軍隊整編的意見，同時承認中共部隊整編之最低限度的數目和中共領導下的部隊，從八個地區撤退，幷且準備成立三人軍事小組，商量整軍問題。第十項關於解放區問題，這個問題不能得到協議，所以決定一個辦法：（二）繼續商談，（二）如商談不決，則提交政治協商會議討論。第十一·十二，兩項是關於奸僞和受降問題，原則上已有協議，因與進兵問題有連帶關係，也就議而未決，由此可以看出，在紀要中，政治方針是確立了，人民的權利有了，規定軍隊國家化，有了開步走的方法，祇是地方政權未能得到適當的解決。一直繼續到去年雙十節後的會談，也依然未得到解決。從這兩個時期商談經騐中，可以看出多年來兩黨的對立，要求得一個協議，是怎樣的困難。因此我們覺得，從痛苦的經騐中，能够得到一點敎訓，來供這次政治協商會議諸位的參考，或者比之空論過去，較爲有益。</p>
<p>保持基本精神　互相承認互相協議</p>
<p>現就商談中得到的四點經騐敎訓，特向各位陳說：第一點，是要互相承認，不要互相小視，旣然商談了就是要政治解決，也就應該互相承認，不應互相敵視，尤其是商談的雙方代表，更要常常保持這種態度。我想在這裏特別提出一位在抗戰前半時期，奔走團結而故去的國民黨朋友張淮南先生，應該對他表示紀念。彼此承認不可敵親，不但兩黨當事人應該如此，就是兩黨黨員也應該如此。中共方面有這樣一個信念，不管衝突怎樣嚴重，我們對於已經承認了的，並不改變，舉幾個主要的說：（一）我們認爲孫中山先生的三民主義，是今日中國所必需，我們承認，我們擁護，而且在我們自已的工作區域內，努力求甚實現，決不因爲衝突，而拋棄自已已經承認的信念。（二）我們承認　蔣先生在全國的領導地位，不僅在過去抗戰的八年中，在抗戰勝利以後仍然如此。這在民國卅一年中共七七紀念宜言中，就提到此點，這句話相隔四年多，現在證明了。（三）我們承認國民黨是第一大黨，我們始終尊重國民黨在歷史奮鬥中得來的地位。（四）國民政府雖然是國民黨一黨統治，且到今天爲止，還是一黨的政府，但是我們旣然合作，所以從民國二十五年底以來，就沒有不承認國民政府，也沒有任何時期，想推翻闕民政府，而只是要求改組政府，祇要看自抗戰以來敵後的民主政府，是地方性的，始終沒有樹立另外一個領導的中心政權，就可以證明，就是去年解放區籌備召開的解放區人民代表會議，也可是解放區人民的聯合組織，這些認識，我們認爲很重要，有此承認，可以證明不是敵視，而且是建立政治解決的基礎。因此，我們同樣要求國民黨方面，給我們以應有的承認，如我們過去所提到的中共合法地位問題，陝甘寗邊區及其他解放區問題，中共領導的武裝部隊問題，因爲承認是一事，承認了並不等於這些部隊就不能整編，這些地方政府就不能改選。第二點，是要互相商討，不要獨斷，旣然是政治解決，就是要互相協議，而不是一方面決定了，通知到別方面去做，這樣是無法求得解決的。此次政治協商會議開會，對於這一點能處理得更好，一定可以建立起一個協商的規模，過去的很多糾紛，常因不能互相協商，徒然引起更多隔閡，樹立更多障礙，朋友間處理一件事，尙不能如此，何況兩黨的關係，國家人民的事。我們認爲在政治協商會議中希望對於國家人民的大事，能在協商的空氣中，求得解決。</p>
<p>在大前提之下　互相讓步彼此競賽</p>
<p>第三點，是要互相讓步，不要獨覇，旣然政治解決，總是要於國家人民事業有利，旣然於國家人民事業有利，那麼兩黨之間，各方面之間，有什麼不可以讓步的？不錯，立國的原則，像今天中國所需要的三民主義，民主國家制度，這些是不能讓步的。沒有這種準繩與方針，就不能談到合作。不過這種大前提下，許多具體問題，應該力求互讓，如同過去所爭執的軍隊問題，地方自治問題，人民權利問題，都應該在立國方針和制度之下，求得互讓解決，不應要求獨覇。有人說，你們祇問政府要求民主權力，你們中共所領導的地區怎麼樣呢？我們誠意的回答：凡是我們向政府提出的保證，在我們活動的地區，不僅是同樣實行，而且願意首先實行，假如我們實行得不夠，願意接受各方面的批評，謀更好的改革。假如大家不信，我們願意歡迎任何人去考察，參加指教，尤其歡迎因抗戰而流亡在外地人士，全部回鄉，因為他們是那些方的主人。第四點，是要互相競賽，不要互相抵消，我們覺得旣是政治解決，求合作，那麼兩黨也好，各方面也好，總有些意見不同，應該在工作上競賽，在地方上努力，而不是說你做好了，我不高興，或者這一方面做好了，那一方面不高興，因為好的事情，都應該歡迎，不管行之何方，出之何黨。祇有這樣，中國的人民力量，民族精華，才能不互相抵消，才能有益於建國。</p>
<p>以上四點，是從九年來雙方商談中得來的痛苦經騐與敎訓，雖似泛論，但很希望各位先生，和全國人民，暸解這是一種由衷之言。我們誠懇希望，在這次政治協商會議上，能够認識到這方面，這是我要報吿的主要部份。附帶的回答幾個在商談中的問題。</p>
<p>對各方面疑問　分為八點作總答復</p>
<p>在過去不能每次把商談內容公開，常受各方批評乃至輿論上的責難，不過商談的雙方，想把事情辦好，談好才公布，不能隨時公布，也是當時雙方的苦心，但不能應有苦心，就不諒解各方面乃至與論上的責難，所以今天就根據這種爲識，簡單的回答，中共方面在抗戰後的商談中，常被大家詢問的事情，第一，中共代表在商談中，是不是祗管局部的事，不談全體的事？根據我下面的報吿，可以看出，在抗戰中是先從全體談到局部，再從局部談到全體。抗戰勝利以後，先談定了方針，然後談具體，決不敢沒有方針，祗談局部的問題，這是不可能的。這一點不僅中共方面如此，政府方面也是如此，第二，是不是祗談軍事不談政治？在會談紀要十二項中，可以看到政治問題，包括最多，軍事方面，僅有三項，假如不因爲政治部份之地方自治問題延擱下來，軍事問題也許早已解決。第三，是不是在商談中祗講中共自已方面的事，不談關係人民的事？我可以說，不是因爲協議中許多項目，都是與人民利益有關，就是軍隊整編，也是關係減少人民担負的一件大事，而地方自治，更是有關萬萬以上人民的民主問題。第四，是不是祗限於國共兩黨或是別的黨沒有得到應有的重視？不是的，此次政治協商會錢的召開，就可以證明這一點。第五，是不是中共祗向政府要求，不向自己要求？剛才的報告，可以證明，凡是向政府要求的，一定要求自已區域實行，而且有許多已經實行，如果不信，屬意請大家去考察和指教。第六，我們所談得地方自治，是不是地方割據？過去在抗戰環境中，在敵後的人民選舉範圍，或是程序上有些不够澈底，但的確是選舉的，並且我們承認這種選舉，在和平時期更應求其澈底，這是人民的權利，不能說割據，因爲地方自治，要和軍隊整編，分開爲兩件事。第七，是不是中共放棄聯合政府的主張？不是的。在抗戰勝利以後的商談中，爲求得有效的解決問題，應有步驟與程序，所以在雙，並希望在和平建國方案，乃至國民大會憲章中，來解決這一問題。第八，政治民主化在先還是軍隊國家化在先？我們回答：執其一端，必致造成對立，例如：中共說，先要政治民主化，軍隊才能國家化。或是政府說，先要軍隊國家化，政洽才能民主化。這樣就無法解決，我們的意見認爲應該並行前進，歸於一途。我們看會談記要第九項，已給軍隊國家化定了一開端的辦法，同時該項又說政府認爲各項問題，未能全盤解決，則軍隊數目，可以考慮，證明政府意見也是如此。以上八個問題，常常遇到許多方面質詢，今天我在這裏不僅向政治協商會議諸位先生，同時也向全國同胞，作這一個總的回答。（中央社重慶十三日電·全文完）</p>

<h3 id="c39">五十載奮鬥八年抗戰成果　東北展開新形勢 <a href="#c39" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e39" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">39</a></h3>
<p>— 蔣君章（本報特約稿上篇）</p>
<p>我們的東北地方牽入國際政治的漩渦而成爲世界主要問題之一，是始於一八九四年的中日之役，到現在已經足足有五十年的歷史，在這五十年當中，忽而日本獨佔，忽而帝俄獨佔，忽而日俄均勢，又忽而我們主人翁反而被日本所奴役，即蘇聯亦不能保持其僅有的中東鐵路。可是就在這驚濤駭浪發展至最高點的時候，我們中國不顧前途的艱險，不管國內外環境的複雜困難，定下了抵抗侵略收復失地的根本大計，終於血戰八年之後，達到收復的目的。雖然未來的困難不是沒有，但是目能在蘇聯誠意合作和美國道義協助之下，東北的接收已逐步實現，循此以往，我們相信東北的收復，在我中央政府統治之下，不過是時間問題罷了。因此，作者以偷快的心情，樂於把東北的國際關係，尤其是最近一段的國際關係，向我們的讀者報吿。</p>
<p>聯俄制日</p>
<p>講到東北的國際關係，使我們不能不回溯到滿淸的積弱，是問題的根本所在，而日本的大陸政策和帝俄的東進政策，是使該問題趨於複雜困難的另一主要動力。我們不會健忘，中日之戰，日本割了我們的遼東半島，由於俄德法三國的干涉，遼東半島重入中國版圖。可是這一干涉，卻使當時的外交家李鴻章認為聯俄制日是東北前途的一大轉機，抱了這種理想，李鴻章就以參加俄皇加冕禮爲名，跑到了莫斯科，帶回來的是中俄合辦東淸鐵路的章程和政守同盟的密約，這東淸鐵路，就是後來的中東鐵路和南滿鐵路，也就是今日的長春鐵路。東淸支路直達旅順大連的結果，使遼東半島終於以租借地的形式轉到了帝俄的手裏，這樣便造成一九〇四年的日俄之戰。在這個戰役中，沒有出息的淸政府，反拋棄了當時聯俄的主旨，守着局內的中立，一任大好河山，做他們的戰塲；而不中用的帝俄，也被日本軍隊打得落花流水，狼狽而去。日俄均勢，由是造成，中國也就在這種均勢之下，保持了東北的主權，苟延殘喘至「九一八」的前夕。</p>
<p>日本獨佔</p>
<p>「九一八」後，日本獨佔了東北，那時候雖然中東路的經營，依然在蘇聯的手中，日本沒有强迫蘇聯交出該路。可是日本有的是辦法，它在中東路的西方造一條平行鐵路，自海拉爾經索倫，大賚，長春，接通舊有之吉敦，天寳兩路，直達圖們江邊，更自圖們江邊，築一鐵路，北上至松花江邊之佳木斯，截東段中東路於牡丹江，復自吉敦路上之拉法築一支路以接通中國舊有之呼海鐵路，截中東路於哈爾濱。又將中國舊有之洮齊鐵路，分兩綫延長至黑龍江濱之黑河屯。自此中東路被截爲四，周密包圍，軍事價值和經濟價值，都降低到最小限度，至此蘇聯保有此鐵路，徒然增加許多麻煩和負担。此爲蘇聯不能不出售中東鐵路之實際理由。這是一九三五年三月的事，故蘇聯之退出東北，亦已十年於茲，視我國政權之被驅退出，僅後四年半。</p>
<p>三大文獻</p>
<p>自從九一八事變以至七七全面抗戰開始以後的二年之間，中國在東北的地位只限於法律的和名義的，在國際方面所得的援助，也只是消極的最多是同情的而已。直等到歐洲發生戰爭，日本南進益急，並正式與德義締結同盟（一九四〇年），於是英美戰略家始確認東亞戰局，實爲太平洋安危之關鍵，而與歐洲戰局之勝敗更有其不可分離之關連性。基於這　認識，中國對東北之外交，逐漸發展到實際有利的階段，這個有利的狀况，我們可以從三個最重要的文獻中看得出來。茲將該項文獻，摘引如次：</p>
<p>開羅公報</p>
<p>開羅公報，是　蔣主席羅斯福總統邱吉爾首相於一九四二年十二月會議於埃及首都開羅後所發表的宣言，中間有一段說：「三國之宗旨，在剝奪日本自從一九一四年第一次世界大戰開始後在太平洋上所奪得或佔領之一島嶼，在使日本所竊取於中國之領土，例如東北四省，合灣，澎湖羣島等，歸還中華民國」。</p>
<p>波茨坦　宣言</p>
<p>又本年七月，英，美，蘇三國領袖，會議於德國的波茨坦，會議中，由中，英，美三國的名義，發表一個宣言，開出了日本無條件投降的條件。宣言共十三點，其中第八點說二「開羅宣言之條件，必將實施」，這就是說，東北四省，一定要歸還中國，而且此項宣言，顯然得到蘇聯領袖的正式承認，因此，中國的收回東北，得到了一層更多的保證。</p>

<h3 id="c40">再向法國進一忠告 <a href="#c40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>法艦白爾丁號擅載戰犯出口一案，日來已逐漸引起嚴重局勢。昨天上海市學生且有遊行請頤，要求政府嚴正交涉的舉動。如再不速謀合理的解次，事態或將更形惡化。目前五十一國代表正集議於倫敦，謀聯合國組織的誕生，以期維繫世界持久和平，而竟讓白爾丁號那樣事件發生，且未能及早解次，誠實憾事。此事之漸趨惡化，主要由於法政府發言人對此事件的聲明。據聯合社巴黎電，法政府發言人宣稱：「法國將以在華治外法權問題提交倫敦聯合國大會討論。法方之見解則爲在中法兩國簽訂新約之前，法國在華仍保有治外法權，並正式支特駐滬法總領事費禮浩立塲」。在這以前，法駐滬總領事又曾宣稱將它作爲「地方事件」。以此等重大事件而企圖改變爲中國人民所最厭聽的「地方事件」，已足够中國人民憤激。乃法政府發言人又欲將此侵害中國主權之白爾丁事件提付聯合國大會討論，中國人民不能不認爲此在中法睦誼上留一大汚點。我們不但要駁斥法政府發言人的失態，並且希望我國民政府能够採取必要的措施、</p>
<p>法方的見解，以爲在中法新約未曾正式簽訂發生效力以前，法方在華繼續保有領事裁判權一節，本報曾著論加以駁斥。因爲中法舊約早隨法國的崩潰而自然廢棄，法國在華特權，包括領事裁判權在內，亦均已隨舊約的廢止而廢止。現在新約雖沒有正式成立，照理應受中國法律的管轄；何得仍復企圖保有舊約特權？况我國外交部早於三十二年五月十九日照會法國駐華暫行代辦使事彭固雨氏，鄭重申明「所有法國依照中法間不平等條約所取得之租界，北平使館界，上海公共租界與廈門公共租界行政權，領事裁判權，及其它特權，已因法國之非法行爲（當時法方違犯國際公法妄與僞組織簽約歸還租界）歸於消滅，中國政府不再受其拘束」。三十四年十二月三日，我外交部又公布：「查各國在華所享受治外法權，均已取消，我法院不應承認任何國家尙在我領土行使治外法權」。法國對於上項措施旣無異議，自已承認；而今乃有上海法總領事之荒謬行爲，法政府發言人之荒謬言論，中國人民對於法方之有此種行爲與言論，無不表示憤慨。</p>
<p>法方之欲特白爾丁事件　交聯合國仲裁，適足表示法方實無解決此事件之誠意，而企圖加以延宕，造成先例，俾使有所藉口，繼續行使其業已廢棄之特權。是其用心之險惡，不言可喩。查聯合國機構尙未正式產生，是項機構之運轉，尙有待於異日，即其機構已達於運轉階段，像白爾丁那樣的事件，非爲一種國際紛爭，實係一宗明顯的不法及不友好的行爲，不具備提付國際仲裁的條件；况中國對於是案之提付國際仲裁，更根本無接受的義務。凡此種種，法政府並非不知，其所以發出此種言論者，實藐視我政府，藐視我主權，而欲故意延宕此案之解次，希冀取得有利地位而已。我政府對此案旣提抗議，要求撤換失職法總領，撤退所有在滬法軍及越警，取消法在滬領事法庭，據木報重慶專電所稱，法駐渝使節亦認爲條件優渥，自應及早接受，了此一案。但看到法政府發言人的態度，又似乎此案之解次尙遙遙無期。這豈不是有意來刺激中國人的情緒？我們固不願見這事件的擴大，但法方亦應負責不增加擴大的因素。平心而論，法奸罪有應得，我們次不袒護，法政府亦自可希望處以刑罰。只要法方向我當局檢舉，在華的法奸自必能按照中國法律處罪，即欲申請引渡，亦非絕對不可考慮。而法國政府却一意孤行，侵犯主權，以致造成此種不幸事件，事後又復恃變支持駐滬法領之非法行爲，是此事件之產生以致擴大，法方應單獨負其責任！</p>
<p>白爾丁事件發展到現階段以後，我們覺得外交當局太忍讓了，外交部所提的抗議和要求，實不能平國人的憤激。我政府應重視此事爲帝國主義者妄想死灰復燃之試探，重提更嚴重之抗議，要求法政府即行答復；倘有延宕，我們更應採取斷然的措施，召回駐法使領，撤消法國駐華使領人員的承認。我們頤於此再向法政府進一忠告：中法兩國在第二次世界大戰中遭到了軸心的侵略，創巨痛深，正應如何心心相印，痛定思痛，共謀世界和平之重建，法國何竟不顧一切，造成白爾丁那樣的意外事件及其後惡化的局勢？法國今日應即自行糾正，方可大事化小。否則中國政府爲防止同樣事件的發生，自應不惜採取斷然措施，以確保國家主權的完整。</p>
<p>自巴黎解放，法政府重遷巴黎以來，法國的對外政策，其一貫的作風是蠻幹，是胡圍·因叙利亞方面的流血，而引起的英法關係惡化，即其先例。今乃又復對我蠻幹。法國的對外政策，原不是我們所要顧問的，這在法政府自有其權衡。不過這種蠻幹政策，不能施之於他處者，而竟欲加諸我國，必將招致中國人民的不滿與反感。中國已不是五十年以前的中國！中國人民也不是百年忍辱的人民！我們始終認爲道次事件乃是帝國主義故態的復萌，與在生長中的新中國絕不相容。我們要制服這些帝國主義者的企圖！還要特別提醒大家的：任何外人，倘仍有頭腦昏庸，今後還想沿襲帝國主義者的猙獰作風，公然妨害我主權者，我們都可由政府繩以國法，人民方面新不可自亂社會秩序！</p>

<p>請市府撥給補助費</p>

<p>主席報吿</p>
<p>（一）上次會議決定學費標準後，市政會議又議決一標準，與我等議決之標準相去甚遠。小學敎職員薪金最高僅二萬五千元，低至一萬八千元，不能維持生活。（二）本來私校不願增加學費，但在市政經濟未充沛時，舍此實無他途。（三）我等所以要增加學費，因爲（一）增加學費可使優良敎師返歸學校，（二）私校待遇不應低於市校，（三）學校經濟應絕對公開，（四）敎育機會均等，使境况較裕之家長多負担，使私校得多設免費學額。</p>
<p>討論事項</p>
<p>（一）擁護上次會議（七日）所擬下學期各校預原則，（敎師與市校同等待遇）。（二）請市府按月撥給私校補助費，小學每級二萬五千元，初中三萬元，高中三萬五千元，否則爲維持本市敎育計，請提高收費標準。（三）至本月二十五日，補助費尙未核准，亦未修正市府所定教費標準時，各校發表自定收費標準宣言，並刊登聯合招生廣吿。（四）本市各級學校敎職員十女肄業各私立中小學者，一律免除學費。（五）本市敎職員遇有婚嫁或喪父母配偶，或女敎員生育情事請假時，仍領原薪，代課敎員之薪給，由校另行支給。（六）各校切實施行經濟公開。（七）推徐鏡淸等九人，向市府及敎局請願。至四時半，並在原處招待新聞界。由臨時主席團代表民國女中校長蔣紀周報吿，大意謂此次經市敎育局所規定收費原則，實與各校預算相差甚鉅，擬請局方准予調整收費規定，並撥給補助經費，更請求新聞紙勿再使用「學店」兩字，以報導詳實爲要，更請代爲申述本市各私校之苦衷及要求。相繼由各校校長發表意見，至五時許始散。</p>

<p>上海商社爲政治協商會議已在重慶揭幕，昨特舉行時局座議會，計到綢緞業·米業·製藥廠業·第六區蘇浙皖棉紡業·呢絨業·新藥業·紙業·橡膠廠業等同業公會代表一百餘人，僉以此次協商會議結果之臧否，攸關國族興衰，工商界爲國民一分子，負有經濟建設之神聖任務，亟盼協商會議結束紛爭不安之局面，奠定和平建國的方案，本「主權在民」之義，決定由各同業公會聯名發表重要宣言，常推駱淸華氏即席草就，經到會各代表先行簽章，再分送全市二百餘同業公會，共同蓋章，郵寄重慶政治協商會議，茲探錄宣言全文如左：</p>
<p>鄭重宣言　重慶政治協商會議公鑒：在聯合國首次大會揭幕之日，吾國民政府召集之政治協商會議，亦適於斯時在重慶舉行，以求結束國內紛爭不安之局面，商討和平建國的方案。我上海工商各業同業公會，鑒於斯次會議結果之臧吾，實爲國家興衰存滅之轉換點，爰本「主權在民」與「匹夫有責」之義，向與會諸公暨全國同胞謹致鄭重之宣言：</p>
<p>恢復交通整編軍隊　（一）恢復交通整編軍隊竊自九一八日本軍閥在潘陽北大營燃起侵略的烽火，首先强佔吾東北國土，製造僞滿傀儡政權，以次蠶食華北，妄岡遂行其併吞滿蒙家滅亡中國征服世界之野心，終致偷襲珍珠港，掀起全面的第二次世界大戰，吾國在過去十五年空前未有之國難時期中，外當强敵壓境，內則黨見分歧，雖在舉國一致神聖抗戰的口號下，而政令軍令未嘗澈底統一，　防割據之局面，未嘗澈底消除，雖有抗戰建國綱領，始終未爲地方政機所衷心接受，以此應付歷史未有之國承戰爭，決民族生死存亡之命運，雖幸盟邦共同協力，公理終勝強權，迄今河山再造，天日重光，但偶一回溯往事，猶覺危機一髮，不寒而慄。乃自暴敵屈降之後，舉世正慶和平之際，吾國竟於斯時廣泛展開自相殘殺的內亂，黃河流域，大江南北，以至滿蒙察綏，烽火迎天，殺人盈野，破壞交通，毀滅礦　，刦餘之民，流離失所，國族　機，行將斬滅，乃勞盟邦之諄　勸吿，軍民同胞於八年來血肉　得之國際地位，已有岌岌動搖之勢，吾工商各業，多年來身受內憂外患之痛苦，最感直接與深切，故對於內亂，亦最爲疾首痛　。今幸三人小組會議已獲成就，停止衝突，恢復交通之命令，亦已公佈，爲此竭誠　請所有部隊，立即遵令停止衝突，整編軍隊，恢復交通，以便義民還鄕就葉，疏暢貨運，平抑物價，使經濟金融得早日恢復正常狀態，政府並應毅然執行全國各地之受降任務，迅速遣送敵俘敵僑返國，使全國各地的社會秩序，早獲平復安定。</p>
<p>東北特殊化堅決反對</p>
<p>（二）反對東北特殊化　柬北九省，爲中華民國整個領土的一部，蘊藏豐足，物產富饒，尤爲我國步上工業化經濟建國之命脈，其行政系統與政治設施，歷來以至永恒均與內陸各行省不容有若何之差別，與中央政府不容有絲毫之分離。近有倡爲柬北「特殊化」之說者，其人若非喪心病在，必係別具用心，須知吾人均能回憶九一八前夕敵人所倡「滿蒙特殊化」之謬說，吾人更痛心疾首於塘沽協定前後敵人漢奸口中之「華北特殊化」與「北五省自治「歷史的慘痛敎訓，使全國人民均有明白正確之認識，至今任何野心家，不必妄想因襲故智。東北乃中國之東北，非任何一姓一系之所得私有，封建閥閱，玩弄偶像之陳腐伎倆，已不能欺朦痛定思痛之東北同胞，凡欲支解國土主權，妄圖割據稱雄，巧倡邪說，旨在醞釀第二僞滿者，均爲吾人所堅決反對，且終必受全國民意的譴責，以致自尋毀滅。</p>
<p>變相國營盼作賢明修正</p>
<p>（三）護主席經濟政策上海工商界竭誠擁證蔣主席之新經濟政策，與所倡導之最高經濟委員會，吾國欲步上民主富强之途徑，必須致力於經濟建設，改善生產技術，提高國民生活，在世界大戰停止的不久，杜魯門總統即在國會宣布經濟政策八項，切重於工商業之維護，失業與通貨膨脹之防止，他山之石，可以攻錯，吾生產落後之國家，欲改善工農生活，必先維護工商企業，鼓勵生產與輸出，由於戰時社會生活變熊所形成之階級嫉視，「無商不奸，」賤商主義之歪曲理論，先須一掃而空。吾國以全民抗戰獲致勝利，今後更須動員全民力量，從事建設，工商企業家更應仰遵主席訓吿，一致奮起，自爲王動，負荷經濟建國之神聖任務。至言經濟復興的步驟，則先須謀工商業之復蘇，戰時上海工商業，首受摧殘，其後轉輾內遷，支持抗戰者，固已器材破舊，物資日蹙，其殘留在滬者，亦橫受敵僞之一再掠奪，盡敲骨吸髓之能事，民力已疲，無分內外，工商界瘡　滿目，亟待蘇息，政府宜本培養稅源之宗旨，减免課征，輕其負担，吾人不能同意建立於拍賣工廠器材，以平衡赤字之財政政策，蓋查政府接收之敵偽產榮，多數工廠物資，係敵人奪自吾國工商業者，不問其當日採用何種方式，要皆物各有主，政府於接收之後，均應查明原主，悉數發還，責令尅期復工，其有確爲敵僞新建或增設者，亦應用以優先賠償前後方因抗戰損失廠產之工商企業家，以求早日恢復生產，如果不此之圖，無論任何託辭，或爲拍賣圖利，或爲變相之國營，以與民爭利，吾人認爲均非主席獎助工商之本意，無以平人心而孚衆望月，甚願政府亟起作賢明的修正。</p>
<p>信賞必罰人心自平</p>
<p>（四）安定人心信賞必詞　安定人心之爲當今急務，旣爲朝野一致所公認，爲欲達此鵠的，首在嚴忠奸順逆之辨，史稱「漢高入關中，的法三章，與民更始，秦民以安」，，戰爭結束，於今已及五月，收復區之經濟復員，迄未能如預期之恢復正常狀熊，以增裕生產，究其原因，由於接收人員未能迅速達成任務者半，由於收復區人心不安，疑懼觀望者亦居半，查懲治漢奸條例，旣經明令公佈，工商界中如有背叛祖國，憑藉敵僞勢力，危害他人的行爲，經查明罪證確實者，應早公開審結，按律判罪以重法紀，如若罪嫌不足者，依法自不致株連瓜蔓，政府似宜廣爲曉喻，並明定檢舉的期限，以安反側。抑有進者，爲政之道，貴明賞罰，有罪當誅，有功自亦應賞，戰時工商界不乏毀家紓難者，亦有不避艱險，協助抗戰者，亦有含垢忍辱，屏障同業，掩護地下工作者，似均應分別表彰，以資激勸，庶幾信賞必罰，人心自平。</p>
<p>主張民主更需要法治</p>
<p>（五）國民大會實施　政　吾人期望政治協商會議，順利達成其任務，結束多年紛爭的局面，奠定和平建國的始基，希望會議早日圓滿結束，於五月五日如期舉行國民大會，實施憲政，還政於民，我們主張民主，我們更需要法治，惟有透過國民大會，以還政於民，才合民主的法則，政治協商會議，是步往國民大會的橋樑，不是分配權利的機構，我們不希望如紐約明星日擁的預測，「此種局面甚至遲廷數年以上」，我們不顧想像「結束一黨訓政」代以「多黨專政」。惟有如期召開國民大會，實施憲法，依法產生民主的政府，方是舉國一致的願望。惟有全國的農工商學兵，才是國家眞正的主人翁，希望政治協商會議各位代表，接納我們以上的貢獻，更望各地的工商團體，與全國同胞，不放棄主人的權職，一致起來，共同主張，謹此宣言。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕昨日高院特別刑庭，自晨九時起，連續審理漢奸案五件，各情分誌如下：</p>
<p>首由祝宗海推事升庭，審訊漢奸凌光炎，吳江人，三十八歲，早年畢業於持志大學，留學法國。戰前曾以私人資格赴日考察商法，娶有日妻。抗戰軍興後，參加偽組織，迭任僞軍政各職達六年之久。勝利後在本市都城飯店，爲我憲兵捕獲。該案已一再審理，庭上昨又提出收到之證據稱，凌於於蘇州曾創立大發公司賭塲，且又設慰安所，將我女同咆供敵蹂躪。並於卅二年廢曆正月初七，率敵至吳江縣掃蕩，鄕民因而被殺甚多。此外並覇佔蘇州陸泰豐號主田產，而私人在吳江置有二千餘畝，蘇州置有數百畝地產。凌逆對於上述罪行，一槪否認，而對於私產，則諉稱祗吳江有田地百餘畝。因被吿所舉之四被吿皆未到庭，所收到之證據，尙待調查，故改期再訊。</p>
<p>尚須調查庭諭還押　綱審薛有文及胡承森二人。薛逆四十一歲，南京人，前普陀路僞警察分局第四股主任，被控罪名爲曾拘捕靑年團員李承宣等土三人，並與任內諸政治謀殺案等有關。但蒔稱第四股管轄保甲及工廠，與特務工作無關，逮捕事未曾顧問，事後且曾設法將十三人釋出，並列舉釋放我被捕之地下工作人員等事實。庭諭待調查後再審。繼訊問胡承森，前任普陀路僞警察分局探員，曾逮捕共產黨靑年邱妙祺，胡於庭上承認有其事。因兩被吿皆患有重病，未曾多問，即行押下。被吿之辯護律師曾申請交保醫治未准，庭諭就監獄醫院治療。繼由證人李承宣將被補情形，詳述一過，因有關政治秘密，故禁止旁聽。</p>
<p>下午二時三刻，預定宣判欺壓鄉民之偽檢問所員徐行，劉庭長因事實尙需調查，故改期宣判。</p>
<p>被告否認代敵招工　綱由曹駿推事升庭，承審充當翻譯代敵招工赴新加坡工作之顧友棠。顧於庭上供稱祗任通譯之職，與招工無關。招工逃由該廠日技師島崎政藏，及在另之工頭陳水堯負責。庭諭傳該日人到庭作證，候期再審。</p>
<p>網由劉毓桂庭長承審另一代敵招工赴菲列賓工作之江友根，左明，兩人。江爲魯班殿紅帮木匠工會之董事長，左則爲日山久公司之翻譯。民國三十二年敵海軍武官府曾委託山久公司，向魯班殿招募造船木工一百八十人赴菲。江供稱招工由日人主持，彼且曾因撕去在魯班殿所貼之招工吿示，而爲日憲兵所擊，故實寃枉云。左明則稱不顧問招工事，故實無關。繼由山久公司的經理黑田，及會行滕屋到庭陳述一切。後田木匠公會代表四人，爲江辯護，並保證江過去之行爲，庭論事實待調後再行審理，被告還押。</p>

<h3 id="c88">爲孩子們呼籲 <a href="#c88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>— 石溪</p>
<p>經過八年抗戰齣苦難日子，我們的孩子們，多數在精神和身體方面，都呈患着急性的營養不良，衰靡不振的貧血病。除了少數『天之驕子』的『肥實費』之外，大多數兒童都是些蓬頭垢臉，缺乏營養的『未來中國主人翁』。</p>
<p>不幸的他們，生在如此人間：沒有先後天適宜的營養，沒有完善的家庭，沒有前進合理的社會，沒有錢，沒有助，沒有生存的空間，沒有人間的溫暖……他們所有的，祇是那些艱困痛苦的經歷，辛酸壓榨的嘗味！過着非人的生活。</p>
<p>爲了我們的『第二代』着想，在天日重光的今日，應當爲孩子們作一點幸福的呼聲：</p>
<p>第一，我們的孩子們需要營養食物；</p>
<p>『民以食爲天』，孩子們更不能例外：奶粉，麥片，魚肝油，鷄蛋，魚，島肉，牛肉，水菓，蔬菜，以及各種含鈣，鐵，燐，蛋白質，各類維生素的食物，都是急需的營養品。必須有適宜的滋養，孩子們才能有健康的身體，活潑的精神。</p>
<p>第二，需要保暖的衣裳；</p>
<p>四季氣候不同，孩子們需要四時適用的衣裝．雖不求奢侈，但必以保持溫暖，穿着簡便，適合衛生爲要旨。</p>
<p>第三，需要安適的住宅：</p>
<p>空氣的不潔，人口的擁擠，里弄的汚穢，都是疾病的來源，我們的住宅太不合乎衛生了。我們需要改良的合理的住宅，『兒童新村』的設計，更當是孩子們最理想的家園。</p>
<p>第四，需要幼稚園，花園式一的。兒童學園，兒童圖書館，兒童食堂，育嬰堂，托兒所，福幼院，兒童健康檢查所，兒童病院，齒科醫院，療養院，兒童音樂院，兒童劇塲……全都有最新科學設備的，以及兒童保健設施等等爲兒童謀幸福的機關。這種種的實施，都是戰後今日孩子們所亟諾的。</p>
<p>也許，你說，我們的希望太奢了，但事在人爲，我們如不爲國家爲民族前途設想則已，否則當爲我們『第二代』子孫打下堅固的根基，好好的把他們培養起來，比我們這一代人好一點。</p>
<p>聽說國　救濟總署和英國兒童救濟機關，不久將派員來華，調查我國兒童在救濟方面的需要，給以精神上與物質上的援助。雖則我國各省市有很多辦理兒童福利事業的機關，進行種種救濟工作，然我們自問經濟能力有限，不能作更理想的事業。當茲勝利的今日，國際人士，對我兒意救濟事業，旣同情願加援助，正是我們大聲疾呼之時，謹將上述數端聊作『拋磚引玉』的呼籲。</p>
<p>雜感</p>
<h3 id="c89">不賣賬 <a href="#c89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>— 易水</p>
<p>不賣賬是一句上海俗語，含有輕視對方之意。某乙不賣某甲齣賬，這綠故，不外某乙並沒有把某甲放在眼裏，或者說簡直就是瞧他不起。瞧不起的原因，總是某乙有實力，有靠山，而某甲沒有。因此，某乙便可神氣活現，處處顯出睥睨一切，滿不在乎的派頭。</p>
<p>這時的某甲，聰明的，估量自已的實力，覺着不行祗好忍下去；火氣旺的，也許會碰上去發生正面衝突；世故深的，或者一笑置之；骨氣傲的，也許從此割席絕交；無恥的，反而會趨炎附勢；心計重的，總要設法報復。</p>
<p>人對人如此，國對國也差不多。大國不賣小國的賬，是理所當然；强國不賣弱國的賬，又是當然之理。這是實力所造成的趨勢，那小的弱的，即便是暫時低頭，也祗好低頭一下。像爪哇的獨立運動早晚還是要低頭吧？我想。</p>
<p>但是，假若一個不起眼的小東西，一個二三等的國家，憑持他的靠山，或是具有甚麼優越感之流，部對勝利後的大國露出不賣賬的神氣和事實，大國爲了國家體面，也許不會輕輕放過罷？</p>
<p>我們這個以愛好和平著名的民族，徧徧遇見些混賬朋友。難道次殖民地的觀念，始終還沒有被這些小東西們忘記嗎？像泰國殘殺華僑事件，如今還未聽見下回分解。這次法國兵艦又公然一聲不響從中國領土上把犯人帶走，這些背後有人撑腰，或是具有優越感的朋友們，始終沒有把勝利後的中國放在眼裏吧！</p>
<p>好在我們素來是主張對外和平的，這又算得甚麼呢？我們不是已經提出抗議了嗎！眞的，這又算得甚麼呢？不賣賬不賣賬好了。阿Q說，『我們不是已經勝利了嗎？』</p>

<h3 id="c90">變氦 <a href="#c90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>— 如水</p>
<p>氦在第一次世界大戰時，纔初露頭角，那時，它只用於盛輕氣球，起先輕氣球都用氫，但氫要燃燒，而氦不能燃燒，經過不斷的研究，在今日的工業上醫藥上也佔得了一席地位，現在就把氨的功用介紹一下。</p>
<p>海洋中的救生船員，往往需要潛入深水的地方去做救護工作。從前他們只可以潛到三百呎的深處，勾留數分鐘，而且往往有被窒息的危險，現在呢，可以深入海內六百呎的處所，停上五六小時，這完全是靠氦的帮助，因爲深海的地方，血液受到外來的壓力，往往引起痙欒毛病，令人神志昏迷，如果在救生員呼吸的空氣中加入氦氣，就不會發生泡沫，而致窒息。它又不像氮氣那樣易溶，所以在血液中的擴散力極大。</p>
<p>如今歐美第一流醫院中，都有氦的裝置，它可以治嚴重的哮喘病，肺炎以及其他有碍呼吸的毛病，把氦氧的混合體吹入氣塞部份，氦把氧一齊帶到病處以便利呼吸。此外初生嬰兒肺部不能開展，也可以用氦來帮助。</p>
<p>施乎術時用的麻醉品往往使病人致死。據說是因爲麻醉劑在肺裏『爆作』的緣故。假如在麻醉品中混入氦，這重危險便沒有了。</p>
<p>製造飛機用的輕金屬，鎂最合理想。但運用平常焊接的方法來鎔　，往往不會有滿意的結果，當吹管中的火焰與鎂接觸時，便一燒而光。因此在吹管口旁裝一氦管，用時氦氣構成一層不燃的氣幕，把鎂和空氣隔絕，鎂便不致於燃燒了。</p>
<p>遠程的空航，飛機的總重愈小愈好，用氦打入輪胎，比用空氣打入要輕得多。</p>

<h3 id="c92">夢裏人生 <a href="#c92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>— 梅幼雲</p>
<p>人們總好不滿於現實，而去思戀那過去的往事。雖然那『往事』明明是他自已一段段過去的『現實』所組合成的，他却偏要說『往事如夢』。當他迴憶到愜意的某些階段時，地更會沉醉在往事裏，說那往事是『夢一般的可愛』。究竟他在那夢一般的可愛的過去的現實裹曾吾細細地領略過沒有呢？</p>
<p>要眞能把整個的人生看作一塲夢的話，那眼前所不滿的現實不也祇是夢的一個片段嗎？爲什麼又不能把現實看成過去，離開現實的立塲來客觀地意味着一切呢？歡樂也好，痛苦悲哀也好，又何必一定要咀咒它呢？更何必現在以『不滿』的心悄來接受它，將來却又以『如夢』的沉醉來迴憶它呢？</p>
<p>當然；現實大都是不如人意的，佛家也說這世界是婆娑世界，要生在這世界上的人們忍受一切。現在的一切旣然都將成爲將來的往事，有什麼痛苦悲哀不能忍受下去呢？</p>
<p>『夢裏明明有六趣，覺後空空無大千』，這兩句證道歌不也是說得很有意思嗎？雖然我們現在還不能證實『覺後』的時候是否眞有靈魂的存在，但是如果能以他所說的『夢裏』來比作我們的人生，不是也可以免却許多無謂的煩惱嗎？</p>
<p>我並不是說應該將人生眞的看成一塲夢，不過是想要人們不要太以現實的不如人意來磨難自已的心情，祇要自已的心靈精神有了寄託點，向着這個寄託點走去，無論你是處在怎麼樣的環境裏，如眞能問心無愧的話，一切的痛苦磨難是可能使你忍受得下去的。如果你的精神寄託點是有益於人類，是對『使這個世界變得更美好點』有帮助的話，那一切的苦痛也可能變成快樂，而讓你愛好你的現實的。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Sun Ke and Others Propose at the Fourth Meeting: Expanding the National Government to Accommodate All Parties; Members Engage in Lively and Extensive Discussions <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 14th] The Political Consultative Conference held its fourth meeting at 3:00 PM on the 14th. The agenda was (1) Political Category (A) Government Organization Issues. Government representatives Sun Ke and seven others presented their views on expanding the organization of the National Government. Youth Party representatives Zeng Qi and four others also proposed a plan to reform the political system and implement political democratization. Only broad discussions were held on the above two proposals during today's meeting. Thirty-four members, including Guo Moruo, attended. Sun Ke served as the chairman of the meeting. The meeting adjourned at 6:10 PM. The fifth meeting will be held tomorrow morning to continue the discussion.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 14th] At the fourth meeting of the Political Consultative Conference, National Party representatives Sun Ke and seven others put forward the following opinions on expanding the organization of the National Government: Before the National Assembly is convened, the Chinese National Party intends to amend the Organic Law of the National Government in preparation for the implementation of constitutional government, in order to enrich the National Government Committee. The main points of the amendment are as follows: (1) The number of National Government Committee members will be increased by one-third from the original quota. (2) Twenty National Government Committee members will be appointed by the Chairman to be filled by non-party members. (3) The National Government Committee is the highest guiding body for politics. (4) The matters to be discussed and decided by the National Government Committee are as follows: (A) Legislative principles, (B) Policy guidelines, (C) Major military and political plans, (D) Financial plans and budgets, (E) Matters submitted by the Chairman for discussion, (F) Suggestions jointly proposed by one-third or more of the committee members. (5) If the Chairman of the National Government believes that the implementation of the National Government Committee's resolutions is difficult, he may submit them for reconsideration. If two-thirds or more of the committee members still insist on maintaining the original proposal during the reconsideration, the proposal shall be implemented. (6) In case of emergency, the Chairman of the National Government may take expedient measures, but shall report to the National Government Committee after taking the measures. In addition, the Organic Law of the Executive Yuan will also be amended as follows: The Executive Yuan will have a number of political affairs committee members who may also serve as heads of various ministries and commissions. Sun Ke, Wu Tiecheng, Chen Lifu, Zhang Qun, Shao Lizi, Zhang Lisheng, Chen Bulei, Wang Shijie.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Chongqing, 14th] Wang Shijie reported that the government's opinions on expanding the government organization are being discussed, showing that the ruling party is preparing to return political power to the people and accommodate virtuous people from all parties to participate in government decision-making and implementation. On the one hand, the National Government Committee will be expanded and its powers strengthened, replacing the power of the Supreme National Defense Council, as an initial step to return political power. On the other hand, the status of participation in the meeting will not be mentioned before the tasks and session of the National Assembly are determined, so as to make cautious consideration and consultation. Zhang Dongsun believes that before discussing the issue of government organization, the government should fulfill the four promises made by the Chairman on the opening day of the conference and immediately abolish or amend laws that clearly hinder the freedom of the people within two or three days. Liang Shuming even more strongly advocated that if the government cannot do this, then there can be no discussion. The question of government reorganization is pressing, creating a bad impression. Shao Lizi said that the National Defense Council held a meeting this morning and has issued an order to abolish or amend various instructions restricting freedom of publication and assembly within ten days, and political prisoners will be investigated and released within seven days. Chen Bulei, who rarely speaks easily, said upon hearing Zhang and Liang's remarks: The government has restricted various freedoms over the years due to the war, and all facilities have been checked and abolished or amended due to the end of the war. However, given the size and complexity of China, it cannot be done effectively if it is forced to be completed within two or three days, which would defeat the original intention. If this is used as a condition for discussing the government reorganization, it may also affect the progress of the consultation and will not be the welfare of the people. His calm and factual remarks reflected the sincerity of the government and were highly praised by the attendees. However, Zhou Enlai then rose to sternly question the cases of Yang Hucheng and Zhang Xueliang. Zhang Lisheng firmly replied: If I were in the position of a party member, I would have the determination and courage to answer. However, in order to take into account the government's position and the smooth and harmonious progress of the meeting, I am unwilling to rehash old grievances and do not want to answer. His stern words and expressions moved everyone, and this disturbance finally came to an end, and the meeting was able to continue.</p>
<h3 id="e2">Air of Cooperation at Xiehe Hospital; Mediation Department Starts Work; Hopes for Smooth Completion in Two or Three Weeks <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 13th] A silver American military aircraft, number "9148," arrived this afternoon at 4:00 PM, carrying twelve peace envoys. Robinson, in a sky-blue suit, was humble, cautious, and serious. Aside from saying that he had been to Beiping, he did not reveal anything about his mission or plans. He is preparing to formally receive reporters at a formal gathering. Director Zheng Jiemin answered all questions and was filled with an air of peace. He said: Stopping the conflict is absolute. He came by plane and is preparing to return by train. When reporters asked how long it would take to complete the cessation of conflict and restoration of transportation, he replied: This is a problem that has not been resolved in nine years of negotiations, and we hope to complete it all in two or three weeks. Ye Jianying is not as thin and handsome as imagined, but rather resembles a chubby little peacemaker. He has a short mustache and wears the most fashionable waist-belted khaki wool military uniform, with a blue wool coat. It is said that he and Director Zheng are in Beiping for the first time. He also said that the Communist Party will absolutely abide by the order to stop the conflict and restore transportation, without any discount. He hopes that the separated cities and villages of North China can be reunited in the future. From his remarks, it was revealed that the Communist Party has nominated Zhou Enlai to attend the three-person group, and the government's selection is undecided. Another representative may also be nominated by the Consultative Council from neutral parties. Because problems that can be solved by ourselves should not trouble our allies. They are all staying at the Beijing Hotel. Robinson is staying in Room 12 on the third floor, and Zheng Jiemin is staying in Room 19 on the second floor.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 13th] Robinson, Zheng Jiemin, and Ye Jianying will work in the cooperative atmosphere of Beiping's Xiehe Hospital to heal the wounds suffered by North China in the military conflict. Zheng hopes that all the work can be completed smoothly in two or three weeks, or even one or two weeks. He said: The two sides have been negotiating for nine years, and if we don't resolve it, we'll be talking until we're old. The Military Mediation Executive Department has 150 people each from the Nationalists, Communists, and Americans, for a total of 450 people. Only twelve arrived today, including three from the United States, four from the Nationalist Government, and five from the Communist Party. All personnel will arrive in Beiping completely before the 25th, and the office location has been chosen for them at Xiehe Hospital. As for how to work, the three will initially exchange ideas tomorrow. When reporters asked Zheng and Ye whether they would visit other places recently, Zheng replied: Waiting for orders. Ye replied: Let's take a look at Beiping first. Generally, under the Military Mediation Executive Department, a number of branch stations will be set up as needed. The Military Mediation Executive Department itself will be divided into three groups: secretariat, liaison, and execution. The personnel for the secretariat and liaison groups have not been determined, the US representative of the execution group is White, the Nationalist Government representative is Cai Wenzhi, and the Communist Party representative has not been determined. The three commissioners of the Military Mediation Executive Department each have one vote. All resolutions must be unanimously agreed upon by the three, and in case of disagreement, they shall be handled in accordance with the terms of the order to cease conflict and restore transportation. Although the department has no direct binding power over the war zone, all orders are issued in the name of the Chairman of the National Government and can be directly ordered to both the Nationalist and Communist armies.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 13th] Zheng Jiemin, in answering reporters' questions here, often spoke of not dwelling on past accounts. Ye Jianying's speech also contained few provocations. An atmosphere of peace and harmony filled the three commissioners of the Military Mediation Executive Department. This is a good omen that there is great hope for stopping the conflict and restoring transportation. When reporters asked about the mission of the Military Mediation Executive Department, and how to explain its handling of surrender matters, Zheng replied: The final goal of the surrender work must be to repatriate overseas Chinese back to their countries. Although most of the surrender work has been completed, this kind of work has not yet been completed, so it is said that the task of the execution department is to handle this item. Ye also believes that the surrender issue has become a thing of the past. The main work of the department at present is to stop the conflict and restore transportation, send back Japanese prisoners of war, and the reorganization, concentration, and deployment of national troops will be handled by the three-person group. In addition to the Nationalists and Communists, the three-person group was originally composed of a member from the United States, but today Ye said that Chinese problems are best solved by ourselves, and the consultative conference may have new resolutions, and the member originally participated by the United States may be replaced by a neutral Chinese person.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 13th] Ye Jianying said: I feel very good after circling Beiping in the sky for a week. This is the Communist military strategist's first impression of Beiping. It was his first time in Beiping, and he called himself a country bumpkin. He did not judge the achievements of the Political Consultative Conference, but only said that everyone was sincere. He also guaranteed that the Communist army would absolutely abide by the order to stop the conflict and restore transportation. One reporter asked: If administrative personnel from a certain county go to places where the political decrees are widespread, will conflicts occur between the two sides? Ye vaguely said that local autonomy will be implemented in the future, and small conflicts cannot be guaranteed to be nonexistent. Someone mentioned the suffering of the people in the besieged city of Beiping, and Ye said that now the countryside is surrounding the city, and in the future, the countryside and the city will be integrated.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 13th] The situation in Rehe is still unclear. Lu Wenzhen, deputy chief of staff of the Eleventh War Zone, told reporters: The command received the ceasefire order yesterday and immediately forwarded it for compliance. The Nationalist troops on the Ping-Rehe line are still between Shixia and Gubeikou. The situation within Rehe is unclear. He also said: In the past two days, the Communist army has still been harassing us, and the Communist army is still rushing to build fortifications near Hashan. Zheng Jiemin answered reporters' questions: According to the information he received in Chongqing on the 11th, the Nationalist troops were in the Lingyuan area. Due to the delayed transportation, the ceasefire order may not have been delivered as scheduled, but the government will ensure that all Nationalist troops earnestly implement the ceasefire order.</p>
<p>[United Press, Beiping, 14th] The staff of the Military Mediation Executive Headquarters are preparing to begin their arduous task of ending the war in North China this morning. The three commissioners may hold a meeting to discuss the situation in North China. According to Ye Jianying's statement to reporters yesterday: He does not believe that the Nationalist representatives will have any difficulties in visiting the Communist areas.</p>
<p>[Another dispatch] The three commissioners of the Executive Headquarters agreed to issue a joint statement within a day or two.</p>

<p>[British News Agency, London, 14th] The Admiralty announced that the 3,000-ton Flower-class gunboat HMS Petunia has been handed over to the Chinese Navy in accordance with the Sino-British Lend-Lease Agreement. The handover ceremony took place on the 12th in Plymouth. Sir Henry V. Markham Pervis, Civil Lord of the Admiralty, representing the Admiralty, formally handed over the ship to Lieutenant General Gui Yongqing, head of the Chinese Military Delegation in the UK and personal representative of Chairman Chiang. The ship's officers and men have been training in the UK for nearly a year. Lieutenant Commander Liu E was appointed to lead the ship back to China. The Petunia is the first warship handed over to China under the Sino-British Lend-Lease Agreement. The ship was built in November 1939, launched in September 1940, and completed in January 1941. It has recently been extensively repaired and is brand new.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 14th] At the routine meeting of the Supreme National Defense Council on the morning of the 14th, Chairman Chiang personally presided over the meeting and gave instructions based on the two items of "People's Freedom and Political Prisoners" in the matters announced by the government at the opening of the Political Consultative Conference on the 10th. The people have freedom of body, belief, speech, publication, assembly, and association. Based on this principle, the current laws will be abolished or amended accordingly. Measures will be drafted within ten days, submitted for approval, and then handed over to the government for implementation. Political prisoners will be investigated clearly within seven days, and those who are traitors and those who have indeed committed acts harmful to the Republic of China will be released separately.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 14th] Reporters have just learned from responsible sources that the "Matters Decided by the Government for Implementation" announced by Chairman Chiang at the Political Consultative Conference on January 10 are all being actively prepared. The first item, "The people shall enjoy freedom of body, belief, speech, publication, assembly, and association. The current laws shall be abolished or amended accordingly based on this principle," was handed over to the Legal Affairs Committee of the Supreme National Defense Council on the 13th to convene relevant agencies, review them promptly, and submit the laws that should be abolished or amended separately for approval and implementation. At the regular meeting of the Supreme National Defense Council on the 14th, Secretary-General Wang Chonghui reported to the meeting. In addition, illegal and ultra vires arrests, interrogations, and punishments of the people in various places will be strictly prohibited immediately. Regarding the release of political prisoners, special personnel have been designated to study the implementation steps and report them within a time limit in order to implement them immediately.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 14th] Xuzhou News, the Zaozhuang coal mine has been repeatedly destroyed by the Communist army, and it will take half a year to repair it after the ceasefire. The Jiawang coal mine northeast of Xuzhou was attacked and greatly damaged by the Communist army yesterday. The people cannot understand the intention of the Communist army to continue destroying coal mines everywhere after the announcement of the ceasefire order. Also, the railway north of Lincheng was demolished by the Communist army for more than ten kilometers yesterday.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 14th] The transportation authorities are actively planning to repair the railways. It is reported that the first to be started is the Tianjin-Pukou Railway. The damaged part of the road is about 300 kilometers long. The most difficult problem now is the material problem. There is a lack of rails and sleepers, which is even more troublesome. We are now quickly trying to buy them for application. It is reported that the highest authorities have ordered the Tianjin-Pukou line to be fully repaired and opened to traffic before the end of February, so the preparations for road repair are extremely active. The engineering personnel have all gathered in Xuzhou, waiting for the materials transported north from Pukou and the materials transported east along the Longhai Line to arrive before they will start work immediately. If there is no problem with the materials, it is said that it can be completed within the time limit. Secondly, the Huainan Road is easier to repair because it is a light railway, and it is already underway and can be repaired and opened to traffic in a short period of time.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Jinan, 13th] According to the Jinan District Railway Bureau of the Ministry of Communications, the sections of the Jiaoji Railway from Jinan to Xindian, Yaogou to Fangzi, and Caijiazhuang to Qingdao are all open to traffic without obstruction.

<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 14th] The deadline for the ceasefire has passed, but the Communist Party's credibility is not trusted. The hardship of the Nationalist army's task is increasing. When the Nanjing Army Headquarters issued the ceasefire order, it used all kinds of communication tools to transmit the ceasefire order and printed nearly one million leaflets, which were carried by planes and distributed to various places. After Deputy Chief of Staff Bai returned to Nanjing, the first question he asked Chief of Staff Xiao was about the ceasefire issue. The first thing Bai and Chen Cheng discussed after meeting was also the ceasefire issue. Minister Chen's enteritis has slightly improved, and it is reported that he will go to Shanghai for medical treatment in the next few days. Deputy Chief of Staff Bai is now busy with the ceasefire all day long. When asked whether the ceasefire can be viewed optimistically, Bai only nodded and pointed to the newspapers in Shanghai and Nanjing on the desk, saying: "We still need to wait for the facts to prove it." In addition, Deputy Chief of Staff Bai inspected Bengbu and Xuzhou this time and inquired in detail about the current traffic conditions and the suffering of refugees in various places, and gave many instructions.</p>

<h3 id="e16">Wang Shijie Explains the Expanded Government Organization Plan at the Fourth Meeting <a href="#e16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 14th] At the fourth meeting of the Political Consultative Conference, Member Wang Shijie explained the government organization plan. The main points are as follows:</p>
<p>The proposal to expand the government organization put forward by the Chinese Kuomintang representatives has been printed and distributed to everyone. Before explaining this proposal, let me report our basic concepts. First, we believe that the organization of government agencies should be expanded to accommodate people from outside the Kuomintang within government agencies. Second, we believe that the agencies that accommodate people from outside the Kuomintang should not be limited to the highest decision-making bodies of the government, but also the executive agencies can accommodate people from outside the party. Chairman Chiang also declared this in his New Year's Day broadcast. Third, the expanded organizational system is ultimately a transitional system from now until the implementation of constitutional government, so both legal and factual considerations must be taken into account. The so-called consideration of facts is to make this system closer to the future constitutional system; the so-called consideration of law is to avoid fundamentally shaking the legal system during this transitional period. We have formulated this plan for expanding the government organization based on the above three principles. Our plan for expanding the organization of the National Government consists of six items:</p>
<p>(1) The number of members of the National Government Committee will be increased by one-third from the original number. The current National Government Committee has 36 members, and 12 more members will be added, for a total of 48 members.</p>
<p>(2) Members of the National Government Committee may be appointed by the Chairman upon request to fill positions with people from outside the party. The so-called appointment means that the Chairman of the National Government requests the approval of the Central Executive Committee of the Kuomintang. This procedure will be maintained before the National Assembly is convened, otherwise the legal system will be changed. However, in terms of personnel selection, since we want to accommodate people from outside the Kuomintang today, we must first solicit opinions from all parties before requesting appointments. As for the distribution of quotas, it is also impossible to stipulate in law, especially under the current circumstances. If it is forced to be stipulated in writing, it will inevitably lead to unnecessary disputes and will not help. How to stipulate the distribution and personnel selection can be resolved after the government consults with all parties after the method is passed. However, I must add that everyone present recognizes that the Kuomintang is a large party participating in the leadership position. If the number of Kuomintang members is only more than the number of any other party, but does not have a certain majority, the Kuomintang will not be able to fulfill its leadership responsibilities.</p>
<p>(3) "The National Government Committee is the highest guiding organ for politics." This clause is an abstract provision. The actual power of this committee is clearly and specifically stipulated in the next clause.</p>
<p>(4) The National Government Committee has six powers: A, to discuss and decide on legislative principles. In the past ten years, this agency was formerly in the Central Political Conference, and later in the National Defense Supreme Council. The meaning of this power is that the principles of all legal bills are determined by the National Government Committee, and after the decision, the Legislative Yuan formulates laws based on the principles. The same applies when amending laws. B, to discuss and decide on policy guidelines. All major government policies have been discussed and decided by the Central Political Conference or the National Defense Supreme Council in the past, that is, the bi-weekly military and foreign affairs reports. After the reports, if it is deemed necessary to discuss and decide, it can also be discussed and decided. C, to discuss and decide on major military and political plans. Regarding military and political affairs, the Executive Yuan and the Military Affairs Commission are currently in charge, but the National Defense Supreme Council has the power to make all and final decisions on military and political affairs. The so-called power to discuss and decide on major military and political plans refers to this. D, to discuss and decide on financial plans and budgets. The government's annual national budget and other financial plans are now approved by the National Defense Supreme Council, which is changed here to be decided by the National Government Committee. E, matters submitted by the Chairman for discussion. The above five items are exercised by the National Government Committee. Here, I want to explain to you that this plan does not include the power of appointment, the power to select and appoint ministers of various ministries and commissions, within the powers of the National Government Committee. From the perspective of political effectiveness, we cannot include this power. The highest level of the power of appointment is selection and appointment, and the power of selection and appointment has never been exercised by the National Defense Supreme Council. As for the deputy ministers of various ministries and commissions, and the personnel selection of various provincial governments, it has always been decided by the Executive Yuan. If people from outside the party join the Executive Yuan in the future, they should participate in the exercise of this power of appointment. As for the appointment of ministers of various ministries and commissions, according to the examples of democratic countries, they are often not submitted to the parliament for approval. The United Kingdom is the most obvious example. In China's situation, if a responsible Premier of the Executive Yuan has to submit each minister to the National Government Committee for discussion and criticism, it will be difficult for the Premier to be responsible, and those who cherish their reputation may not be willing to take on the post of minister. Naturally, there may be improper personnel selections in the government as a result, but there is also a remedy for this, because our plan still has item "F", that is, one-third or more of the members can jointly propose any motion. Then, if a minister is found to be derelict in his duties, a motion for impeachment or other corrections can naturally be drawn up based on item "F". We believe that not only during this transition period, the method of the power of appointment can only be like this, but even in the future constitution, the appointment of ministers of the Executive Yuan will probably only be like this in principle.</p>
<p>(5) If the Chairman of the National Government finds it difficult to implement the resolutions of the National Government Committee, he may submit them for reconsideration. If two-thirds or more of the members still insist on maintaining the original plan during the reconsideration, the plan shall be implemented. The meaning of this clause is that the absolute veto power is not given to the Chairman, and at the same time, the Chairman of the National Government is not a so-called "reigning but not ruling" Chairman, like the head of state of the United Kingdom. The system in this clause can be said to be adopted from the United States.</p>
<p>(6) In case of emergency, the Chairman of the National Government may take expedient measures, but shall report to the National Government Committee after the measures are taken. In the current situation, it is inevitable that emergencies will occur externally. When emergencies occur, the Chairman must have the power to take emergency measures. The last clause is that the Executive Yuan shall establish several ministers without portfolio, and the ministers without portfolio may concurrently serve as ministers of various ministries and commissions. This clause is to enable people from outside the Kuomintang to participate in the executive agencies. As for the number of ministers without portfolio and whether they concurrently serve as ministers of various ministries and commissions, it should not be rigidly stipulated, and the needs of future facts can be used to determine it.</p>
<p>In this plan, we did not mention the National Political Council. The reason for not mentioning it is that the task of this National Assembly has yet to be clarified. It remains to be determined whether the task of the National Assembly is to draft a constitution or to implement a constitution. If the National Assembly is convened on May 5 and drafts and implements a constitution at the same time, the issue of the National Political Council may not need to be discussed much, otherwise the status of the National Political Council must be seriously considered. We are prepared to offer our views on the National Political Council issue when the task of the National Assembly has been decided. (End)</p>

<p>[Report from this newspaper] According to a London broadcast on the 14th: Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Vyshinsky has arrived in London today to lead the Soviet delegation to the United Nations General Assembly.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 14th] The United Nations General Assembly is scheduled to discuss the control of atomic energy and the work of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) this week. After a two-hour meeting yesterday, the Standing Committee has already decided on the agenda issues.</p>
<p>[United Press, London, 14th] When the United Nations General Assembly debates the issue of atomic energy control this week, US Secretary of State Byrnes, British Foreign Secretary Bevin, French Foreign Minister Bidault, and Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Vyshinsky will all speak. At the same time, two proposals from the Cuban representative were not included on the agenda. One proposed expanding the Executive Committee, which was referred to a special committee of the General Assembly. The other requested a declaration on international obligations and the rights of humanity and nations, which was deemed unnecessary because the United Nations Charter already had adequate provisions.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 13th] Representatives of various countries at the United Nations General Assembly today emphasized reorganizing the Social and Economic Council to eradicate the roots of war in the social and economic fields. Representatives of various delegations discussed outside the meeting and generally believed that the Council is expected to begin work within two weeks to improve the lives of people around the world, solve unemployment problems, and protect various basic freedoms of mankind.</p>
<p>[United Press, London, 14th] Eighteen seats on the United Nations Economic and Social Council are being contested. Seventeen have already been elected. New Zealand and Yugoslavia were competing for the remaining seat. Today, New Zealand withdrew its candidacy, and Yugoslavia was elected, breaking the deadlock. At the same time, the General Assembly decided on the terms of office for the council members as follows: China, France, Canada, Belgium, Chile, and Peru will each serve three years; the United Kingdom, the Soviet Union, India, Norway, Cuba, and Czechoslovakia will each serve two years; and the United States, Greece, Ukraine, Colombia, Lebanon, and Yugoslavia will each serve one year.</p>
<p>Security Council to Convene Soon to Lay Foundation for the United Nations</p>
<p>[United Press, London, 14th] The Security Council, composed of the five major powers and eleven countries including Brazil, Poland, the Netherlands, Egypt, and Mexico, is scheduled to meet at the beginning of this week to equip the United Nations with teeth, decide on the meeting date of the Military Staff Committee composed of the chiefs of staff of the five major powers, and order it to determine the distribution table of military force provided by the fifty-one member states for the organization of the world security force. The Security Council will then decide on the selection of the Secretary-General, and the five major powers must unanimously agree on the selection of the person. It is reported that General Eisenhower will definitely not be a candidate for Secretary-General. Other details are not known, and perhaps this issue will have to wait until the plenary session convened in the United States in April before a decision can be made. One of the important tasks determined by this plenary session is to establish a Trusteeship Council to supervise the implementation of the United Nations Trusteeship System. All territories currently under mandate, territories taken from enemy countries, or territories voluntarily wishing to be placed under the trusteeship of other countries are subject to the jurisdiction of the trusteeship system. Some British newspapers predict that when the General Assembly discusses this issue, British Foreign Secretary Bevin will first propose that Britain's mandated territories, including Palestine, Tanganyika, Togoland, and part of the former German African colonies and the Pacific's Nauru, be transferred to the United Nations Trusteeship Council.</p>
<p>Various Parties Favor Eisenhower for the Post of General Assembly Secretary-General</p>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] According to a broadcast from San Francisco on the 14th: The post of Secretary-General of the United Nations is of great importance, and many parties favor General Eisenhower, but Eisenhower has stated that he is unwilling to take on this position.</p>
<p>[United Press, London, 14th] The "London Sunday Express" urged the United Nations representatives to nominate General Eisenhower as Secretary-General of the United Nations General Assembly, making him "the most powerful person in the world." The newspaper said that Eisenhower is detached from the politics of his own country and other countries, and is unanimously trusted by the people of all countries in the world. The newspaper declared, "Whoever is elected Secretary-General of the General Assembly will be the most powerful person in the world, because he has the power to punish aggressor nations."</p>

<p>[United Press, Mexico City, 14th] The Mexican government issued a declaration last night, ten thousand words in length, proposing that when the foreign ministers of the American countries meet in the Brazilian capital this spring, they should conclude a treaty under which all countries will take joint action to prevent aggression. If disputes arise among the American countries, they should be submitted to the Pan-American Committee or the International Court of Justice for handling. The contracting countries should formally declare that they will not engage in wars of aggression. If the American countries have disputes with other countries, they must not resort to force. Except as permitted by the United Nations organization or as decided by it to take joint action, or as legitimate self-defense under the United Nations Charter, force must not be used under any circumstances. The following methods should be used to impose sanctions on aggressor countries: recall ambassadors stationed in the country, sever diplomatic, economic, and commercial relations, suspend all postal and telecommunication exchanges, or use military force. As for which country is merely an aggressor country, if there is any doubt, the Executive Committee of the Pan-American Union should make a temporary decision first, and then the Pan-American Consultation Meeting should make a final decision. This treaty should be signed by the American countries within this year, and a Pan-American Staff Corps should be organized to control the military forces that each country should dispatch to deal with the aggressor country.</p>

<h3 id="e22">The United States Army, Navy, and Air Force to Conduct Atomic Bomb Explosion Force Tests This Summer; Johnson Predicts Future Navies Will Only Operate Underwater; Conant States Atomic Energy May Be Available for Commercial Use Within Five Years <a href="#e22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 13th (Reuters)] Rear Admiral Blandy, Deputy Chief of Naval Operations, told reporters today that the U.S. Army, Navy, and Air Force will jointly conduct tests this summer on the impact of atomic bomb explosions on warships and surface and underwater vessels. If Chief of Naval Operations Nimitz agrees, tests of unmanned rockets may also be conducted simultaneously.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 14th] Vice Admiral Blandy, Deputy Chief of Special Weapons Operations of the U.S. Navy, officially announced today that the joint Army-Navy plan to test the effects of atomic bombs on large fleets is now ready and has been handed over to the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who will soon disclose the location, date, and other details of the test. This test, which could revolutionize naval warfare, will not be held before spring, but a fleet is currently being assembled. Its composition remains secret, but it is expected to include captured German and Japanese vessels as well as obsolete American ships. Well-informed sources predict that Vice Admiral Blandy will be appointed by the Joint Chiefs of Staff as the overall commander of this test. Blandy stated that the test will involve a large number of personnel, including naval aviators, army aviators, army troops, and scientific personnel. It must be conducted from domestic, international, and naval, army, and technical perspectives.

<p>[United Press, Washington, 13th] Senator Johnson, a member of the Senate Atomic Energy Committee, predicted that in the future atomic world, all navies will operate underwater. He stated that since the birth of the atomic bomb, all surface ships have become ineffective. He imagines future battleships as uranium-powered submarines equipped with atomic bomb rockets. In future wars, not only battleships but also oil tankers and aircraft carriers will operate underwater. He stated, "The entire navy must operate underwater because surface ships cannot withstand the power of atomic bombs." Johnson believes that mankind will never be able to abandon atomic bombs as weapons of war. "This is the cheapest and most effective weapon. If there is war, it will inevitably be used. Anyone who thinks otherwise is deceiving themselves."</p>
<p>[United States Information Service, New York, 13th] According to New York Times reporter Pearce, the Society of Automotive Engineers, at a meeting held in Detroit last week, predicted that atomic energy could be used for commercial purposes within five years. According to Dr. Conant, former president of the Columbia University Institute, "Based on the progress of research on the commercial application of atomic energy, it seems possible to use atomic energy in large power plants, transport ships, airplanes, jets, propulsion engines, and rockets. However, I do not currently believe that atomic energy can be used to power automobiles, as at least five to ten feet of space is required to protect against atomic energy radiation." "Atomic energy is unlikely to completely replace ordinary fuels in most applications but will serve as a supplement to existing fuels." "There is hope for obtaining cheap atomic energy by burning lower-grade materials together with U-235, which may reduce the production cost of atomic energy." "We currently only have superficial gains. At present, the equivalent cost of U-235 is US$52,000 per pound, while aviation gasoline only costs two cents per gallon. Compared to coal, U-235 costs US$9,000 per pound, while coal only costs US$6 per ton. The most pressing issue now is how to effectively utilize its high temperature. Fortunately, atomic energy can be applied at low temperatures, and most industrial applications do not require a very high concentration of U-235. In other words, the substance does not exist under highly explosive conditions."</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 13th] The establishment of the United Nations headquarters has raised many questions in Washington. Although the permanent location of the headquarters has been decided to be near New York or Boston on the East Coast of the United States, the exact amount of funding required, the number of buildings needed, and when it can be completed are still uncertain. Some speculate that the construction cost may be US$25 million, or even more. This is based on the fact that the League of Nations headquarters in Geneva cost approximately US$10 million to build, and it was built during the recession around 1930, when labor costs in Switzerland were much lower than in the United States. However, in the coming years, the prices of raw materials and wages in the United States are likely to be very high, and the United Nations organization requires more buildings than the old League of Nations. The League of Nations had only five main buildings: offices, an assembly hall, conference rooms, a library, and a secretariat. No one knows how many buildings the United Nations organization needs, but it will inevitably need more space than the old League of Nations. The League of Nations had a maximum of fifty member states, and only forty-five remained at the end. The United Nations organization currently has fifty-one member states, and it is expected to increase to sixty in the future. The scope of work of the United Nations organization is also much broader than that of the League of Nations, so it undoubtedly needs more staff. The League of Nations had a maximum of seven hundred staff members, including senior scientific and economic advisors and secretaries. The United Nations General Assembly will soon decide on the permanent location of the headquarters and send a design committee to carry out the design work of the headquarters. According to the current plan, this committee must submit its final recommendations by 1947, and construction of the headquarters will begin immediately. The required expenses will be shared proportionally by the member states. Architects from various countries will likely compete for the selection of the building style under the guidance of the United Nations organization, as they did during the construction of the headquarters in Geneva. After the drawings are finalized and all preparatory work is completed, the next question will be how long it will take to build these buildings. Various speculations seem to have reasons, so it is impossible to say a rough period. The old League of Nations began working in London in 1919, and the cornerstone of the Geneva headquarters was laid in 1929, but it was not fully completed until 1936. The interior decoration was mostly donated by member states, which was an excellent opportunity for publicity in various countries. Their art statues, etc., could be used to showcase them to the world. This method may still be adopted by the United Nations organization, and the maintenance costs may still be borne by the member states. In addition, there are many other minor issues, such as whether the staff of the United Nations headquarters enjoy extraterritorial rights in the United States, like foreign ambassadors and ministers to the United States. According to current diplomatic practice, the host country cannot sue foreign ambassadors and ministers for debts or arrest them for murder. Only their home governments have the right to do so.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Seoul, 13th] Approximately 1,000 Korean people marched today, scattering leaflets, to protest the Moscow Conference's decision to place Korea under a four-power trusteeship, expressing sympathy for the newly established "Committee of Seventy-Seven." This is the third anti-trusteeship demonstration in two weeks. National Party leader and "Committee of Seventy-Seven" member Cai Hong (transliteration) stated that the demonstration was the final expression of the Korean people's hatred for the trusteeship plan. At the same time, Communist leaders, under attack from various parties claiming they advocate the Sovietization of Korea, specifically announced their denial.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 13th (Special Telegram)] According to Allied General Headquarters instructions, the Japanese general election, originally scheduled for this month, will be postponed until before March 15th. The Japanese government will continue to maintain its position until that time. Headquarters instructions explained the nature of this general election, stating that the most important thing is to take all steps to ensure that the free and unrestrained will of the Japanese people is fully expressed in this election. All Japanese people should take necessary measures to ensure that this inviolable right can be effectively implemented.</p>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 14th] MacArthur's Headquarters approved the new appointees of the Shidehara Cabinet last night. At 11 p.m., the final three cabinet members of the completed cabinet reshuffle were formally appointed before the Emperor Hirohito. The new three cabinet members are Minister of Interior and Minister of Transportation Chuzo Mituchi, Minister of Education Abe, and Minister of Agriculture and Forestry Tsuchishima. Today, according to reliable sources, the new Minister of Commerce, Saburo Ogasawara, formerly served as the president of the Imperial Rule Assistance Association, so questions arose during the final decision, causing the formal appointment ceremony to be delayed.</p>

<p>[United Press, Washington, 13th] U.S. Army Chief of Staff Eisenhower and U.S. Chief of Naval Operations Nimitz will attend a joint meeting of Congress on Tuesday to answer questions regarding the slow progress of the Army and Navy demobilization plans. This is a direct result of the demonstrations made by American troops in various places regarding the slow demobilization. The extent to which Army and Navy leaders can quell congressional public anger will likely have a significant impact on the passage of the compulsory military training bill and the extended service bill.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Calcutta, 13th] Five thousand American troops in the India-Burma theater met today, accusing the Army Department authorities of improper demobilization arrangements, shipping non-essential materials back to the United States first. This is the second major meeting held by American troops since April. The meeting passed a resolution requesting the U.S. Congress to urge demobilization, immediately sending back to the country all personnel whose implementation of American policy is not absolutely necessary.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 14th] According to Army Department records, more than half of the U.S. Army has been demobilized, and one-third of the Air Force has been demobilized. At its peak, the U.S. Army had eighty-six combat divisions, totaling 8.3 million people. Forty-six divisions, approximately 5 million people, have now been demobilized.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 13th] Rear Admiral Denfield, Chief of Naval Personnel, announced today that all naval personnel whose service period is about to expire can retire. It is said that as of January 8th, the number of naval officers and soldiers has decreased from a peak of 3.3 million to 1,316,299, slightly exceeding the planned demobilization plan. After the demobilization is completed, the Personnel Bureau will be responsible for maintaining a regular navy of 500,000 people.</p>
<h3 id="e27">Japanese War Crimes Issues Included on the Agenda of the Far Eastern Commission <a href="#e27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Tokyo, 14th] The issue of Japanese war criminals has been included on the agenda of the Far Eastern Commission today. The committee has broad powers to determine the occupation policy of Japan. The issue of war responsibility is within its scope of discussion. However, representatives have not expressed whether any changes will be recommended in terms of policy. Major General Dyke, director of the Civil Information and Education Section of Headquarters, discussed the Japanese education reform plan with representatives today. The delegation is scheduled to inspect the factory area and Yokohama within two days, and hold meetings with the military government and the import and export group on Thursday. On the 24th of this month, they will discuss the issue of war criminals with the judicial authorities of Headquarters. Major General McCoy, chairman of the committee, announced today that the eleven member representatives (the Soviet Union has not yet sent a representative to join) of the Far Eastern Commission have not yet decided whether any recommendations will be made regarding the occupation policy during their stay in Tokyo. Perhaps they will only take action after leaving Japan. It is now decided to depart on the original ship, the "Mount McKinley," and arrive back in Honolulu on the second of next month.</p>

<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 14th] The second session of the 79th U.S. Congress convened today, which is the first peacetime meeting since 1941. The problems to be discussed are piled up like mountains. How to mediate the relationship between Congress and the president, which is tense to the point of breaking, is also a concern of all parties. In addition, this year is also a year for the re-election of Congress. All 435 members of the House of Representatives and one-third of the Senate members, namely 32 people, will be re-elected in November. At that time, the Republican Party will take the opportunity to overthrow the Democratic Party's advantage in Congress. Its success or failure is enough to influence the American political situation thereafter, so both parties are going all out for this week's meeting.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 14th] The White House announced today that President Truman is preparing to request Congress to extend the effective period of the wartime price control law for one year, until June 30th of next year.

<p>[United Press, Washington, 14th] According to sources in Washington today, an international conference will be held this spring. Representatives from fourteen countries other than the United States will attend the conference. The main purpose is to discuss the conclusion of a separate trade agreement between the United States and the participating countries. The countries attending the meeting include Australia, Brazil, Belgium, Luxembourg, Canada, China, Czech Republic, France, Netherlands, India, New Zealand, the Union of South Africa, the Soviet Union, and the United Kingdom.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 14th] According to reliable sources, France is continuing to request economic assistance from the United States, and other countries are also eager to obtain loans from the United States. It is rumored that the Soviet Union plans to obtain a US$6 billion credit loan from the United States. According to another reliable source, the amount of loans that foreign countries, especially European countries, intend to borrow from the U.S. Export-Import Bank has exceeded the bank's fund several times. Officials believe that Congress must be consulted as to whether it intends to increase its lending capacity. It is pointed out that a few months ago, Congress approved a new amount of US$2.8 billion, increasing the bank's lending capacity to US$3.5 billion. It is said that although the U.S. Export-Import Bank has approved loans to France, Belgium, Norway, the Netherlands, and Denmark, the needs of other countries have greatly exceeded the bank's remaining funds.</p>

<p>[United Press, Washington, 13th] The proceeds from the sale of the remaining U.S. materials in China may be transferred to a scholarship fund for the exchange of Chinese and American students. Senator Yake proposed in Congress to turn U.S. wartime weapons into a tool to promote international understanding, to be applied to countries such as China, Australia, Britain, France, India, and the Soviet Union. The so-called exchange students will include transportation, education, and other scholarship expenses, estimated at US$2.5 million per country per year. The proposal will soon be submitted to the Senate Military Committee for opinions. This move will make the State Department the agent for all remaining overseas materials and lend-lease items. The State Department can use this to enter into agreements with relevant foreign governments, so that the funds can be used as a "fund for teaching and research for foreign students in the United States and American students abroad, and all other educational activities."</p>

<p>[Associated Press, New York, 13th] The U.S. Navy Department announced today the long-range electronic reconnaissance device invented during the war. It is said that this device played an important role in the victory of the Atlantic naval battles. Its technical term is called "High-Frequency Electrical Guidance Direction Finder," which can locate a ship or an airplane in half the world, but it is often used in conjunction with the weather predictor radar for shorter distances. This device is installed on ships or airplanes and can disperse submarine groups before they gather. In 1942, it detected the location of a German submarine that had landed saboteurs on Long Island and sunk it. This device can collect any sound or radio signal in international traffic routes and display the direction of its source in a fraction of a second. By installing two or three sets on shore or in the air and sea, simple arithmetic can be used to calculate it.</p>

<p>[Reuters, Paris, 14th] French authorities have begun arresting wealthy traitors, many of whom belong to the so-called "Two Hundred Families." National Production Minister Paul (a communist member of the cabinet) decided to investigate the activities of the three directors of several electrical and steel manufacturing plants during the German occupation. Paul's actions were not submitted to the cabinet for a decision. However, most of the factories that continued to operate during the German occupation will be affected, and so far, no industrial leaders have been brought to trial for treason. With the next election scheduled for June, there are widespread calls for major entrepreneurs with confirmed treasonous acts to be punished before the election. Since the liberation of France, the economic and political power of the so-called "Two Hundred Families" has been greatly hit. If this broad term is used to refer to people who have become wealthy through generations of operating industry and commerce, their number may be close to four thousand, far more than two hundred families. Before the war, these "Two Hundred Families" actually controlled most of France's industry, including banks, railways, steel industry, telephone industry, shipyards, power plants, telegraph companies, automobile factories, insurance companies, textile factories, distilleries, flour mills, sugar factories, and a large number of food stores. Now, the coal mines in northern France have been nationalized, the Bank of France and the four major lending banks, as well as the Renault automobile factory, have also come under state control, and power plants will soon be taken over. Therefore, the economic and political status of France's wealthy has been shaken.</p>

<p>Principles Decided for Financial Relief</p>
<p>In recent years, the finances of various counties in Zhejiang Province have reached an extreme state of difficulty, and local autonomy projects cannot be carried out. The total estimated revenue of all counties in the province for this year may only be a little over 4 billion yuan, while the total expenditure is about 8 billion yuan. The revenue is only half of the expenditure. The provincial government specially resolved the following five principles for balancing the estimated revenue and expenditure of each county for this year the other day:</p>

<p>Sixth Political Affairs Meeting Held</p>
<p>The county government held its sixth political affairs meeting yesterday. County Magistrate An presided over the meeting, and the following important cases were resolved: (1) To formulate measures to encourage animal husbandry and protect afforestation, to increase production; (2) To formulate regulations and detailed implementation rules for requisitioning labor for dredging rivers, as well as methods for rewards and punishments, to facilitate construction; (3) To formulate provisional measures and forms for handling commercial registration, to be submitted to the province for approval; (4) The Civil Affairs and Construction Departments will jointly form a National Labor Service Corps.</p>
<p>Submitting a Request to Restore First-Class County Status　Before the war, this county was originally a first-class county. Recently, the provincial government adjusted county levels, downgrading this county to a second-class county. Local people here believe that the county's population, land area, and taxes all meet the requirements for a first-class county, and have specially jointly submitted a request to the provincial government to restore its first-class county status.</p>

<p>This county is located in a strategic area and suffered severe damage from the enemy and puppets during the Anti-Japanese War. Since the establishment of the Post-War Relief Association, it has actively begun investigations. The index of loss is extremely large and cannot be restored without five years of construction. Now, Shen Yalen and others have been specially appointed to go to the province to report the actual situation to the provincial government, the General Administration of Relief and Rehabilitation, and the Su-Ning Branch, and to request the dispatch of special commissioners to Cheng (Jiangyin) for inspection, to clarify the situation and to expedite the implementation of relief work.</p>

<p>County Administration Expenses Must Be Self-Sustained　Jiangsu National Assemblyman Xue Mingjian telegraphed the Executive Yuan last month, requesting that the central government should coordinate the administrative expenses of various counties in the recovered areas. Recently, he received a reply telegram from President Song stating, "National Assembly transmits to Assemblyman Xue Mingjian, your message of November, Zhen is received, I know the financial situation of the recovered areas and the difficult situation, which shows your concern for the people's suffering. However, since the restoration has just begun, the national expenditure is huge, and the legal local autonomous taxes should still be collected, in addition to the exemption of field taxes. Therefore, at the beginning of the restoration of each province, given the exhaustion of the people's strength in the occupied areas and the shortage of tax revenue, the government allocated recovery expenses for support. Now that order is gradually being restored in various places, and industry and commerce have also entered a normal state, the administrative expenses of each county should not entirely depend on the national treasury, and self-sufficiency is required. From next year onwards, in addition to the central government's allocation of national taxes at an increased percentage to the recovered county and city expenses, a subsidy method has been set for all county and cities that have exempted field taxes. The central government will allocate the percentage of field tax and the originally stipulated county-level conscription of 30% county-level public grain, which will be allocated by the national treasury to stabilize the lives of county-level personnel. This is a reply to the previous telegram. Please note, Song Ziwen, Dong Xing, four seals."</p>

<h3 id="e38">Government and Communist Party Representatives' Talks: The Four Stages <a href="#e38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<h3 id="e39">Shao Lizi and Zhou Enlai's Reports to the Third Consultation Meeting <a href="#e39" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c39" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">39</a></h3>
<p>First Report (Continued and Concluded) Shao Lizi</p>
<p>Gentlemen and members of the press, having reviewed the four stages of the talks, you can judge whether both sides participated with sincerity. You can also see that none of the participants dared to slack off. Mr. Zhou has already spoken about the achievements of the meeting, especially regarding the decisions of the Political Consultative Conference. The time spent on the issue of the Political Consultative Conference was not insignificant. It is really not easy to demand quick results in our meeting habits and techniques. However, everyone had the desire to resolve the issues. Therefore, although much time was spent, it was not wasted or intentionally delayed. The talks were not public, with only a simple news bulletin released each day, which both sides deemed necessary. This was to cultivate a good atmosphere in the talks and avoid unnecessary provocation. During the talks, we spoke frankly about everything. Sometimes, we argued until our faces were red and our veins were popping, but we could soon return to a harmonious mood. If the talks were public, perhaps some would take things out of context and make hasty accusations, which would affect the psychology of the participants. Restraints during the talks would lead to reluctance to speak freely. Therefore, both sides agreed to publish the contents to the public when there were results, but to refrain from doing so during the talks. Every issue discussed can be said to be within the minutes of the meeting. If there are points that were not published, they were agreed upon by both sides. Today, I might as well offer a brief explanation to dispel certain misunderstandings. For example, after the meeting minutes were published, military conflicts occurred and escalated. Was this not considered during the talks? I want to clarify that the initial draft of the meeting minutes had thirteen items. The original text of the last item was about avoiding conflict. The Communist Party proposed that all armed conflicts should cease immediately, as long as the Communist troops did not obstruct the advance of the Central Army. This was because the Communist Party initially requested a halt to the advance, and the Central Government clearly replied that the Central Army was advancing to accept surrender, and the Communist Party should not obstruct it. In the final draft of the minutes, the text mentioned above was removed at the insistence of the Communist Party when the meeting minutes were about to be published, to which the Central Government representatives agreed. At that time, the intention was not to cause unease among the people, hoping that discussions would continue quickly after the minutes were published, and that all issues would be resolved, so that military conflicts could naturally be avoided. Later, the talks progressed slowly, and the Military Subcommittee never even convened, which was not foreseen at the time.</p>
<p>Mutual Concessions for the Sake of the Country; Both Sides Have Their Positions</p>
<p>The matters insisted upon during the talks, as seen in the tenth item of the minutes, clearly show that this issue has not been resolved. However, even in this item, we acknowledge that the Communist Party had its position and made concessions, and the Central Government did not completely reject the Communist Party's views. For example, regarding the popular election of governments at all levels, the government representatives stated that they could agree from the county level to the administrative inspectorate area. The meeting minutes also stated, "The Central Government can consider county-level elections plus appointments, while provincial-level elections must wait until the constitution is promulgated and the status of the provinces is determined before they can be implemented." From these points, it can be seen that both sides made many concessions, while also maintaining their respective positions. The government's position was that military and political orders must be unified, a point that it could not concede. During the talks, the government did not first propose a concrete plan, which may be subject to criticism from our conscience and friends. We did not take the initiative in the talks, but we are happy to accept this criticism. Why didn't the government proactively propose a plan? There is a very important reason for this.</p>
<p>An Amicable Atmosphere; The Government Consistently Cultivated It</p>
<p>After the victory of the War of Resistance, Chairman Chiang's telegram inviting Mr. Mao Zedong fully explained the government's hopes. We only wanted to listen to the Communist Party's opinions. If the government had first proposed a concrete plan, it might have led the Communist Party to believe that the government already had a preconceived notion, which would have hindered the progress of the talks. The Communist Party initially put forward eleven points, to which the government responded to each one in writing. Although there were slight changes in the published items of the meeting minutes, they were largely based on the eleven points initially proposed by the Communist Party. From this, it can be further seen that the government consistently cultivated an amicable atmosphere and sought to resolve the issues with sincerity. Speaking of the concessions made by both sides, there are many instances that can be seen. At the beginning of the discussion of practical issues, Mr. Zhou Enlai stated that the Communist Party was prepared to make concessions this time and would not insist on the conditions put forward between December of the previous year and January of this year, such as party conferences, a coalition government, and a joint command. Therefore, when the government responded to the eleven issues, it immediately accepted whatever it deemed should be agreed to and tolerated, and frankly explained the reasons for anything that needed further consideration. The meeting minutes already had a solution, but the military issues that were still pending implementation were also the result of concessions from both sides. For example, the number of Communist troops reduced to twenty divisions clearly demonstrated the concessions made by both sides. The Central Government initially agreed to reorganize the Communist troops into twelve divisions, because in the 32nd year of the Republic, the Communist Party only requested ten to twelve divisions. In the 33rd year of the Republic, the Communist Party only requested six armies and fifteen divisions. This time, the Communist Party initially requested forty-eight divisions, and finally compromised on twenty divisions, which is clear evidence of concessions from both sides.</p>
<p>Political and Military Orders; The Government Firmly Insisted on Unification</p>
<p>What the Central Government resolutely hoped to achieve, and what the people of the country commonly believe is important, is the issue of the unification of military and political orders. As long as military and political orders are unified, all issues can be discussed and resolved. I have always believed that both sides are sincere in resolving the issues. The points on which they have not been able to compromise are due to their respective non-negotiable positions, but they are definitely not insurmountable and cannot be mutually resolved. During these talks, many issues have indeed been resolved, such as convening the Political Consultative Conference. When the meeting minutes were published, a general plan had already been agreed upon, so the time spent on this issue in the resumed talks on October 20th was not much. Also, regarding the National Assembly issue, we have heard Mr. Mao Zedong's views and know that he has a spirit of compromise. Of course, the various issues related to this will have to be resolved by the Political Consultative Conference. Finally, in my position as a government representative, I express my unforgettable gratitude for the assistance and enthusiastic attitude that General Hurley gave to the talks between the two sides. In particular, his efforts in the last two days before leaving Chongqing moved us even more. I take this opportunity to report this and express my admiration!

<p>Second Report (Continued and Concluded) Zhou Enlai</p>
<p>The Communist Party put forward eleven key points, and then the government representatives responded to each item in writing. The points on which agreement was reached during the discussions were recorded, and the points on which agreement was not reached were further discussed. Subsequently, the Double Tenth Agreement, the meeting minutes of the government and Communist Party representatives, was signed. Among them, there were still several major issues that were deemed unnecessary to publish because they had not yet been resolved and needed to be discussed later. For example, regarding the issue of advancing troops, the government troops requested to go to all enemy-occupied areas to accept surrender, while the Communist Party requested that some areas where the armed forces led by the Communist Party were active, the enemy-occupied areas that had already been liberated, or the enemy-occupied areas that had already been surrounded by the armed forces led by the Communist Party, should have both sides' troops temporarily stationed in their original locations before the issue of accepting surrender was resolved, because they could not agree with each other, so the meeting minutes did not include it. Clearly, after the publication of the meeting minutes, the root cause of the continued expansion of the conflict lies here, which can also be seen in the twelve items that have already been published. During this period, the discussion went from general principles to specific issues, and we have always considered the resolution of general principles to be the main success of the Double Tenth Agreement, because as the transition from the War of Resistance to peace, both parties believed that it was necessary to establish basic principles so that the cause of peaceful national construction could have something to follow. Therefore, Mr. Mao first stated this principle to Chairman Chiang, which was agreed to and appreciated by Chairman Chiang. This principle has already been announced in the first item of the meeting minutes. I believe that it is still unchangeable today, and it is often relied upon to prevent the unfortunate conflicts that have occurred in the past few months from continuing and stopping. Precisely because a principle has been established, entering into the discussion of specific issues can achieve many agreements, such as the Political Consultative Conference in the second item of the meeting minutes, which has already been held here. The people's rights and local autonomy and other issues in the fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, and eighth items were again announced by Chairman Chiang the day before yesterday. The ninth item is about the military issue. The Communist Party put forward opinions on the reorganization of the national army and also acknowledged the minimum number of Communist troops to be reorganized and the withdrawal of troops under the leadership of the Communist Party from eight regions, and prepared to establish a three-person military subcommittee to discuss the issue of military reorganization. The tenth item is about the liberated areas. This issue could not be agreed upon, so a method was decided: (1) continue to discuss; (2) if the discussion is unresolved, submit it to the Political Consultative Conference for discussion. The eleventh and twelfth items are about traitors and surrender, and agreements have been reached in principle, but because they are related to the issue of advancing troops, they have also been discussed but not resolved. From this, it can be seen that in the meeting minutes, political principles have been established, people's rights have been secured, the nationalization of the army has been stipulated, and a method for taking the first step has been established, but local political power has not been properly resolved. This continued until the talks after the Double Tenth Festival last year, and it still has not been resolved. From the experiences of these two periods of discussions, it can be seen how difficult it is for the two parties, which have been in opposition for many years, to reach an agreement. Therefore, we feel that it is better to learn a lesson from painful experiences for the reference of everyone at this Political Consultative Conference, rather than just empty talk about the past.</p>
<p>Maintaining the Basic Spirit; Mutual Recognition and Mutual Agreement</p>
<p>Now, I would like to share the four lessons learned from the discussions with everyone: The first point is to recognize each other and not to belittle each other. Since we are discussing, we want to solve the problem politically, so we should recognize each other and not be hostile to each other. In particular, the representatives of the two sides in the discussion should always maintain this attitude. I would like to especially mention here Mr. Zhang Huainan, a Kuomintang friend who worked for unity in the first half of the War of Resistance and passed away, and we should commemorate him. Mutual recognition and no hostility is not only what the parties concerned should do, but also what the members of the two parties should do. The Communist Party has such a belief that no matter how serious the conflict is, we will not change what we have already recognized. To give a few key examples: (1) We believe that Mr. Sun Yat-sen's Three Principles of the People are necessary for China today. We recognize and support them, and we strive to realize them in our own work areas, and we will never abandon our already recognized beliefs because of conflict. (2) We recognize Mr. Chiang's leadership position in the country, not only in the past eight years of the War of Resistance, but still so after the victory of the War of Resistance. This was mentioned in the Communist Party's 7/7 Memorial Declaration in the 31st year of the Republic, and this statement has been proven after more than four years. (3) We recognize that the Kuomintang is the largest party, and we have always respected the Kuomintang's position gained in historical struggles. (4) Although the National Government is ruled by the Kuomintang alone, and it is still a one-party government to this day, since we are cooperating, we have not failed to recognize the National Government since the end of the 25th year of the Republic, and we have never wanted to overthrow the National Government, but only to request the reorganization of the government. Just look at the democratic governments behind enemy lines since the War of Resistance, which are local in nature, and there has never been another central government to take leadership, which proves it. Even the People's Representative Conference of the Liberated Areas, which was prepared to be convened in the Liberated Areas last year, can also be a joint organization of the people of the Liberated Areas. We believe that these understandings are very important. With this recognition, it can prove that there is no hostility, and it is the basis for establishing a political solution. Therefore, we also ask the Kuomintang to give us the due recognition, such as the issue of the legal status of the Communist Party, the issue of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region and other liberated areas, and the issue of the armed forces led by the Communist Party that we have mentioned in the past, because recognition is one thing, and recognition does not mean that these troops cannot be reorganized or that these local governments cannot be re-elected. The second point is to discuss with each other and not to be dogmatic. Since it is a political solution, we want to agree with each other, rather than one side making a decision and notifying the other side to do it. This will not solve the problem. If this Political Consultative Conference can handle this point better, it will definitely be able to establish a model for consultation. Many past disputes often caused more estrangement and more obstacles because they could not be consulted with each other. Friends cannot handle a matter like this, let alone the relationship between the two parties and the affairs of the country and the people. We believe that in the Political Consultative Conference, we hope to solve the major affairs of the country and the people in an atmosphere of consultation.</p>
<p>Under the Major Premise; Mutual Concessions and Mutual Competition</p>
<p>The third point is to make concessions to each other and not to dominate. Since the political solution is ultimately beneficial to the cause of the country and the people, and since it is beneficial to the cause of the country and the people, then what cannot be conceded between the two parties and among all parties? It is true that the principles of establishing a country, such as the Three Principles of the People and the democratic state system that China needs today, cannot be conceded. Without this standard and direction, we cannot talk about cooperation. However, under this major premise, many specific issues should strive for mutual concessions, such as the military issue, the local autonomy issue, and the people's rights issue that have been disputed in the past, all of which should be resolved through mutual concessions under the direction and system of establishing a country, and should not demand domination. Some people say, you only ask the government to demand democratic rights, what about the areas led by your Communist Party? We sincerely answer: All the guarantees we have made to the government, we will not only implement them in the areas where we operate, but we are also willing to implement them first. If we do not implement them well enough, we are willing to accept criticism from all parties and seek better reforms. If you don't believe us, we are willing to welcome anyone to inspect and provide guidance, especially those who were displaced and living in other places due to the War of Resistance to return to their hometowns, because they are the owners of those places. The fourth point is to compete with each other and not to cancel each other out. We feel that since it is a political solution and seeks cooperation, then whether it is the two parties or all parties, there will always be some differences of opinion, and we should compete in work and strive locally, rather than saying that if you do well, I am not happy, or if this side does well, that side is not happy, because good things should be welcomed, no matter where they are done or which party they come from. Only in this way can the people's power and the national essence of China not be canceled out, but can be beneficial to national construction.</p>
<p>The above four points are painful experiences and lessons learned from the nine years of discussions between the two sides. Although they seem like general comments, we sincerely hope that everyone and the people of the country understand that this is a heartfelt statement. We sincerely hope that this aspect can be recognized at this Political Consultative Conference, which is the main part of my report. Incidentally, I will answer a few questions in the discussions.</p>
<p>Answering Questions from All Parties; Eight Points as a General Response</p>
<p>In the past, we could not publicize the content of the discussions every time, and we often received criticism from all parties and even blame from public opinion. However, both sides in the discussion wanted to handle things well, and only publish them when they were discussed well. The inability to publish them at any time was also the hard work of both sides at the time. However, we cannot fail to understand the blame from all parties and even public opinion because of the hard work. Therefore, today, based on this understanding, I will briefly answer the questions that the Communist Party has often been asked during the discussions after the War of Resistance. First, do the Communist Party representatives only manage local affairs and not talk about overall affairs in the discussions? According to my report below, it can be seen that in the War of Resistance, we first talked about the overall situation and then the local situation, and then from the local situation back to the overall situation. After the victory of the War of Resistance, we first agreed on the direction and then talked about the specifics. We would never dare to talk about local issues without a direction. This is impossible. This is not only the case on the Communist Party's side, but also on the government's side. Second, do we only talk about military affairs and not about politics? In the twelve items of the meeting minutes, it can be seen that the political issues include the most, and there are only three items in the military aspect. If it were not for the delay in the issue of local autonomy in the political part, the military issues might have been resolved long ago. Third, do we only talk about our own side in the discussions and not about matters related to the people? I can say that it is not because many items in the agreement are related to the interests of the people, but even the reorganization of the army is a major event related to reducing the burden on the people, and local autonomy is even more related to the democratic issue of tens of millions of people. Fourth, is it limited to the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, or have other parties not received due attention? No, the convening of this Political Consultative Conference can prove this point. Fifth, does the Communist Party only ask the government and not ask itself? The report just now can prove that everything that is asked of the government must be implemented in its own region, and many have already been implemented. If you don't believe it, please feel free to inspect and provide guidance. Sixth, is the local autonomy we are talking about local separatism? In the past, in the environment of the War of Resistance, the scope or procedures of popular elections behind enemy lines were not thorough enough, but they were indeed elections, and we recognize that this election should be more thorough in peacetime. This is the right of the people and cannot be called separatism, because local autonomy should be separated from military reorganization as two separate things. Seventh, is the Communist Party giving up the idea of a coalition government? No. In the discussions after the victory of the War of Resistance, in order to achieve effective solutions to problems, there should be steps and procedures, so the parties hope to solve this problem in the peace and national construction program and even the National Assembly Charter. Eighth, which comes first, political democratization or military nationalization? We answer: If we focus on only one aspect, it will inevitably lead to opposition. For example, the Communist Party says that political democratization must come first before the military can be nationalized. Or the government says that the military must be nationalized first before politics can be democratized. This will not solve the problem. Our opinion is that they should move forward in parallel and converge on one path. We see that the ninth item of the meeting minutes has set an opening method for military nationalization, and at the same time, that item also says that the government believes that if various issues cannot be fully resolved, then the number of troops can be considered, which proves that the government's opinion is also the same. The above eight questions are often encountered by many parties. Today, I am not only giving this general answer to the gentlemen of the Political Consultative Conference, but also to all compatriots in the country.

<h3 id="e40">Fifty Years of Struggle and Eight Years of Resistance: A New Situation Unfolds in the Northeast <a href="#e40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>— By Jiang Junzhang (First Part of a Special Article for This Newspaper)</p>
<p>Our Northeastern region, drawn into the vortex of international politics and becoming one of the world's major issues, began with the Sino-Japanese War of 1894. It has now been a full fifty years. During these fifty years, sometimes Japan monopolized it, sometimes Imperial Russia monopolized it, sometimes there was a balance of power between Japan and Russia, and sometimes we, the masters, were enslaved by Japan. Even the Soviet Union could not maintain its limited Chinese Eastern Railway. However, at the height of this tumultuous development, our China, regardless of the dangers ahead and the complex and difficult domestic and international environment, set the fundamental plan of resisting aggression and recovering lost territories. Finally, after eight years of bloody battle, we achieved the goal of recovery. Although future difficulties are not absent, with the sincere cooperation of the Soviet Union and the moral assistance of the United States, the takeover of the Northeast has been gradually realized. Following this path, we believe that the recovery of the Northeast, under the rule of our central government, is only a matter of time. Therefore, the author, with a joyful heart, is happy to report to our readers on the international relations of the Northeast, especially the recent period of international relations.</p>
<p>Uniting with Russia to Check Japan</p>
<p>Speaking of the international relations of the Northeast, we cannot but trace back to the weakness of the Manchu Qing Dynasty, which is the root of the problem. The continental policy of Japan and the eastward expansion policy of Imperial Russia are another major driving force that complicates the problem. We will not forget that in the Sino-Japanese War, Japan ceded our Liaodong Peninsula. Due to the intervention of Russia, Germany, and France, the Liaodong Peninsula returned to Chinese territory. However, this intervention led Li Hongzhang, a diplomat at the time, to believe that uniting with Russia to check Japan was a major turning point for the future of the Northeast. With this ideal, Li Hongzhang went to Moscow under the pretext of attending the coronation ceremony of the Russian Tsar. What he brought back were the charter for the joint Sino-Russian operation of the Chinese Eastern Railway and a secret treaty of political and military alliance. This Chinese Eastern Railway is the later Chinese Eastern Railway and South Manchurian Railway, which is today's Changchun Railway. The result of the Chinese Eastern Railway branch line reaching directly to Lushun and Dalian was that the Liaodong Peninsula was finally transferred to Imperial Russia in the form of a leased territory. This created the Russo-Japanese War of 1904. In this war, the Qing government, without ambition, abandoned its then-current policy of uniting with Russia and maintained neutrality within the局， allowing its beautiful land to become their battlefield. The useless Imperial Russia was also defeated by the Japanese army and fled in a panic. The balance of power between Japan and Russia was thus created, and China maintained its sovereignty over the Northeast under this balance of power, dragging on until the eve of the "September 18th" Incident.</p>
<p>Japanese Occupation</p>
<p>After the "September 18th" Incident, Japan monopolized the Northeast. At that time, although the operation of the Chinese Eastern Railway was still in the hands of the Soviet Union, Japan did not force the Soviet Union to hand over the railway. However, Japan had its own methods. It built a parallel railway to the west of the Chinese Eastern Railway, running from Hailar through Solun, Dalai, and Changchun, connecting the old Jidun and Tianbao railways, and reaching the edge of the Tumen River. From the edge of the Tumen River, it built a railway north to Jiamusi on the edge of the Songhua River, intercepting the eastern section of the Chinese Eastern Railway at Mudanjiang. It also built a branch line from Lafa on the Jidun Railway to connect with China's old Hu-Hai Railway, intercepting the Chinese Eastern Railway at Harbin. It also extended China's old Tao-Qi Railway in two lines to Heihetun on the banks of the Heilongjiang River. From then on, the Chinese Eastern Railway was cut into four sections, closely surrounded, and its military and economic value was reduced to the minimum. At this point, the Soviet Union's possession of this railway only added many troubles and burdens. This was the actual reason why the Soviet Union had to sell the Chinese Eastern Railway. This happened in March 1935. Therefore, the Soviet Union's withdrawal from the Northeast has also been ten years ago, only four and a half years after our country's regime was driven out.</p>
<p>Three Major Documents</p>
<p>From the September 18th Incident to the two years after the start of the full-scale War of Resistance against Japan on July 7th, China's position in the Northeast was limited to legal and nominal, and the assistance obtained internationally was only passive, at most sympathetic. It was not until the outbreak of war in Europe, Japan's southward advance became more urgent, and it officially concluded an alliance with Germany and Italy (1940), that British and American strategists began to recognize that the East Asian war situation was the key to the security of the Pacific and had an inseparable connection with the victory or defeat of the European war situation. Based on this understanding, China's diplomacy towards the Northeast gradually developed into a practically beneficial stage. This beneficial situation can be seen from three of the most important documents. The relevant documents are excerpted as follows:</p>
<p>Cairo Communiqué</p>
<p>The Cairo Communiqué is a declaration issued by President Chiang, President Roosevelt, and Prime Minister Churchill after their meeting in Cairo, the capital of Egypt, in December 1942. One of the paragraphs states: "The purpose of the three countries is to deprive Japan of all the islands in the Pacific that it has seized or occupied since the beginning of the First World War in 1914, and to return to the Republic of China the territories that Japan has stolen from China, such as the four northeastern provinces, Taiwan, and the Penghu Islands."</p>
<p>Potsdam Declaration</p>
<p>Also, in July of this year, the leaders of the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union met in Potsdam, Germany. At the meeting, a declaration was issued in the name of China, the United Kingdom, and the United States, outlining the terms of Japan's unconditional surrender. The declaration had a total of thirteen points, among which the eighth point stated: "The terms of the Cairo Declaration shall be implemented." This means that the four northeastern provinces must be returned to China, and this declaration has obviously been formally recognized by the Soviet Union leader. Therefore, China's recovery of the Northeast has received an additional layer of guarantee.</p>
<p>Editorial</p>
<h3 id="e41">Another Piece of Sincere Advice to France <a href="#e41" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c41" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">41</a></h3>
<p>The case of the French ship "Béldine" arbitrarily transporting war criminals out of the country has gradually caused a serious situation recently. Yesterday, Shanghai students even held a parade petitioning, demanding that the government make serious representations. If a reasonable solution is not quickly sought, the situation may further deteriorate. Representatives of 51 countries are currently meeting in London to discuss the establishment of the United Nations organization, with the aim of maintaining lasting world peace. It is truly regrettable that such an incident as the "Béldine" could occur and not be resolved promptly. The gradual deterioration of this matter is mainly due to the statement made by the French government spokesman on this incident. According to a United Press Paris dispatch, the French government spokesman declared: "France will submit the issue of extraterritoriality in China to the London United Nations General Assembly for discussion. The French view is that before a new treaty is signed between China and France, France still retains extraterritoriality in China, and officially supports the position of the French Consul General in Shanghai, Mr. Ferriere." Prior to this, the French Consul General in Shanghai had also declared that he would treat it as a "local incident." Attempting to change such a major incident into a "local incident," which the Chinese people hate the most, is enough to anger the Chinese people. Furthermore, the French government spokesman wants to submit the "Béldine" incident, which infringes on Chinese sovereignty, to the United Nations General Assembly for discussion. The Chinese people cannot but regard this as a major stain on Sino-French friendship. We must not only refute the impropriety of the French government spokesman but also hope that our National Government can take the necessary measures.</p>
<p>The French view is that France continues to retain consular jurisdiction in China before the new Sino-French treaty is formally signed and takes effect. This newspaper has published an article refuting this view. Because the old Sino-French treaty was naturally abolished with the collapse of France, and the French privileges in China, including consular jurisdiction, were also abolished with the abolition of the old treaty. Although the new treaty has not been formally established, it should theoretically be subject to Chinese law. How can it still attempt to retain the privileges of the old treaty? Moreover, our Ministry of Foreign Affairs had already sent a note to Mr. Peng Guyu, the French interim Chargé d'affaires in China, on May 19, 1943, solemnly stating that "all concessions, the Beijing legation area, the Shanghai Public Concession, and the Xiamen Public Concession, as well as administrative rights, consular jurisdiction, and other privileges obtained by France in accordance with the unequal treaties between China and France, have been extinguished due to France's illegal acts (at that time, the French side violated international law and presumptuously signed a treaty with the puppet organization to return the concessions), and the Chinese government is no longer bound by them." On December 3, 1945, our Ministry of Foreign Affairs also announced: "It has been found that the extraterritorial rights enjoyed by various countries in China have all been abolished, and our courts should not recognize any country still exercising extraterritoriality in our territory." France has no objection to the above measures and has already recognized them. However, now there is the absurd behavior of the French Consul General in Shanghai and the absurd remarks of the French government spokesman. The Chinese people cannot but express their indignation at the French side's behavior and remarks.</p>
<p>The French side's desire to submit the "Béldine" incident to the United Nations for arbitration is sufficient to show that the French side has no sincerity in resolving this incident, but attempts to delay it, create a precedent, and continue to exercise its already abolished privileges. The sinister intention of this is self-evident. The United Nations organization has not yet been formally established, and the operation of this organization still awaits a later date. Even if its organization has reached the operational stage, an incident like the "Béldine" is not an international dispute, but a clear illegal and unfriendly act, which does not meet the conditions for submission to international arbitration. Moreover, China has no obligation to accept the submission of this case to international arbitration. The French government is not unaware of all these things. The reason why it made such remarks is to despise our government, despise our sovereignty, and deliberately delay the resolution of this case, hoping to gain a favorable position. Our government has protested against this case and demanded the replacement of the derelict French Consul General, the withdrawal of all French troops and Vietnamese police in Shanghai, and the abolition of the French consular court in Shanghai. According to a special telegram from Chongqing, the French diplomatic envoy in Chongqing also believes that the conditions are generous and should be accepted as soon as possible to settle this case. But seeing the attitude of the French government spokesman, it seems that the resolution of this case is still far away. Isn't this intentionally stimulating the emotions of the Chinese people? We certainly do not want to see the expansion of this incident, but the French side should also be responsible for not increasing the factors of expansion. To be fair, the French traitors deserve their punishment. We will not protect them, and the French government can also hope that they will be punished. As long as the French side reports to our authorities, the French traitors in China will certainly be punished in accordance with Chinese law, and the application for extradition is not absolutely unthinkable. However, the French government is acting arbitrarily, infringing on sovereignty, resulting in this unfortunate incident, and afterwards, it is supporting the illegal behavior of the French Consul in Shanghai. The French side should bear sole responsibility for the occurrence and expansion of this incident!</p>
<p>After the development of the "Béldine" incident to the current stage, we feel that the diplomatic authorities are too tolerant, and the protests and demands made by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs cannot calm the indignation of the people. Our government should attach importance to this matter as an attempt by imperialists to revive their old dreams, re-raise more serious protests, and demand that the French government respond immediately. If there is any delay, we should take decisive measures to recall the diplomatic envoys stationed in France and revoke the recognition of French diplomatic and consular personnel stationed in China. We would like to offer another piece of sincere advice to the French government here: China and France suffered from the aggression of the Axis powers in the Second World War, and the pain was great. How should we be able to empathize with each other, learn from the pain, and jointly seek the reconstruction of world peace. Why is France disregarding everything and creating such an unexpected incident as the "Béldine" and the subsequent deteriorating situation? France should immediately correct itself today, so that a major incident can be turned into a minor one. Otherwise, in order to prevent the occurrence of similar incidents, the Chinese government should not hesitate to take decisive measures to ensure the integrity of national sovereignty.</p>
<p>Since the liberation of Paris and the French government's return to Paris, the consistent style of French foreign policy has been reckless and nonsensical. The worsening of Anglo-French relations caused by the bloodshed in Syria is a precedent. Now it is recklessly confronting us again. The French foreign policy is not what we want to advise on. The French government has its own discretion. However, this kind of reckless policy cannot be applied to other places, and it will inevitably cause dissatisfaction and resentment from the Chinese people if it is applied to our country. China is no longer the China of fifty years ago! The Chinese people are no longer the people who have endured humiliation for a hundred years! We have always believed that the incident is a resurgence of the old habits of imperialism, which is absolutely incompatible with the growing new China. We want to subdue these imperialists' attempts! We would also like to especially remind everyone: If any foreigner is still muddle-headed and wants to follow the ugly style of imperialists and openly obstruct our sovereignty, we can punish them by the national law of the government, and the people must not disrupt social order!</p>

<h3 id="e42">Large Speculative Funds Cause Waves: Many Twists and Turns in the Gold Market, Resulting in Continued Rise of 24,000; US Dollars and Hong Kong Dollars Are Stable <a href="#e42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, due to reports that the gold and US dollar markets in North China had suffered tragic declines, the market was suddenly suppressed by sellers, and there was a slight retracement. From the opening price of 846,000, it fell to a low price of 838,000. Later, the two major gangs of securities and paper industries divested their stocks and exchanged them for gold, with a lot of speculative funds. The market changed its target, and the gold market showed more demand than supply, gradually showing a good outlook. At noon, the long-supported shorts suddenly panicked, and there was a small short squeeze scene, rising to a high price of 888,000. The longs also came out one after another, and soon stabilized and turned flat. In the afternoon, it once retreated to within 870,000, and finally struggled around 875,000. As a result, it continued to rise by 24,000 compared to last Saturday. Gold jewelry in silver shops was listed at 93,000, and silver was still 700 yuan. Silver dollars hovered around 440, and the black market interest rate was slightly tighter, about 8% to 10%.</p>
<p>The US dollar was quite stable, slightly advancing and retreating with the gold market. From the morning opening of around 1,435 yuan, it retreated to around 1,430 yuan and hovered for a long time. At noon, the price of gold suddenly became popular, which triggered a wave of arbitrage, and then gradually rose to above 1,470 yuan. In the afternoon, it slightly fell back to around 1,450 yuan. As a result, it rose slightly by 10 yuan compared to last Saturday. The arbitrage price for gold has been pulled up to more than 600 yuan. Due to the arrival of goods, Hong Kong dollar prices loosened across new and old currencies. However, due to some people absorbing the currencies when the price was low, the situation was still peaceful even though there was no huge performance. As a result, the price of old currency fell by 10 yuan, and the price of new currency fell by 3 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e43">Bing Bonds Reach New High Price: Chinese Stocks Fall Back, Foreign Stocks Are Stable <a href="#e43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>The trend of public bonds continued to be popular yesterday, but large investors shifted their targets and sold bonds to exchange them for gold. Under the loosened chips, the price did not rise much, and miscellaneous brands fell back instead. Bing bonds opened at 1,320 yuan in the morning and rose all the way to a new high price of 1,465 yuan. Large investors closed their positions, and the stock market also experienced a pullback. At noon, it fell back more than 100 yuan, hovering around 1,350 yuan. As a result, compared with last Saturday, the price of Bing bonds continued to rise by 50 yuan, A and B bonds were flat, and E and D bonds fell back by 15 yuan and 60 yuan respectively.</p>
<p>The Chinese stock market situation gradually became flat and tired from chaos. Large investors, such as the securities and paper gangs, sold aggressively at high prices, causing Yongsha to fall back from a high price of 1,470 yuan, Meiya from 1,060 yuan, Xinhe from 420 yuan, Xinguang from 87 yuan, Qinxing from 77 yuan, and Jingfu from 83 yuan. However, some retail investors were confused by the large investors' underhanded tactics and absorbed the stocks at low prices. At noon, with the large investors' divesting of stocks in exchange for gold becoming obvious, the retail investors were trapped and painfully rushed to cut their losses. Yongsha then fell sharply to within 1,300 yuan, Meiya to 880 yuan, Xinhe to 280 yuan, Qinxing to 62 yuan, Jingfu to 64 yuan, and Xinguang to 67 yuan. At this time, the unpopular stocks did not see low prices because the time was late. However, the bidding price gradually increased in the afternoon. Compared with last Saturday, Yongsha fell back by 80 yuan, Meiya by 65 yuan, and Xinhe by 70 yuan. The price difference between the three small hot stocks was quite close. Therefore, Xinguang alone fell by 7 yuan, and Jingfu and Qinxing fell by only 3 yuan and 4 yuan. The unpopular stocks still saw a small increase.</p>
<p>Foreign stocks initially saw securities gangs joining in one after another, and retail speculative funds followed suit. After the market opened, a strange scene suddenly appeared. Yisha first jumped up by 10%, and the other stocks also followed suit. At this time, people in the industry and foreign businessmen slightly came out to adjust, and then they turned around. Later, the Chinese stocks suddenly suffered a tragic decline, and the floating long camp collapsed, anxiously falling back. At noon, compared with last Saturday, Yisha was flat, Wheelock Marden rose by 600 yuan with the help of the environment, but it was a one-sided selling price from the supply side, and Yibier and Paper each rose by 6 yuan. The rest rose and fell differently.</p>
<h3 id="e44">Yarn Prices Were Weak Yesterday: Textile Construction Supplies and Sells Large Quantities of Yarn <a href="#e44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's yarn market turned flat and tired in the morning. 20s and 16s yarns were still stable, while 32s fine yarn and 42s thread saw their prices go down step by step due to the continuous supply and sale of state-owned yarn mills, falling by about 570,000 yuan compared to the end of last week. In the afternoon, Textile Construction Company publicly sold a large quantity of yarn again, and the prices were as follows: 10s 330,000, 16s 430,000, 20s 610,000, 32s 950,000, 32s double-strand 1,000,000, 40s 1,000,000, 42s 1,080,000, 60s 1,700,000, 80s 1,950,000. The above yarns are all products of Japanese factories that have been taken over, such as Nikko, Blue Phoenix, Fairy Peach, and Tachiba brands. The future of yarn prices may be suppressed because of this.</p>

<p>The rice market is still bland and weak. Northern japonica and early thin rice both fell by a small amount of 2300 yuan. Indica rice is also showing a tired trend, but white yuan and dark yuan are scarce and expensive. Due to the year-end sales, they are very strong, with 2300 yuan. Soybeans are still tight. Soybean cakes rise and fall sharply. Today, due to the South Seas moving, they are rising by more than 100 yuan again. Oil prices are still firm and slightly tighter. The appetite for flour from the South Seas has weakened. High-end products have been cut in price, and the wine market has been quite active in winter store sales, rising by 500 yuan.</p>
<p>It is also reported that the total transaction volume of rice and grains in the market last week reached more than 20,000 shi, including 6,774 shi of white japonica rice, 11,096 shi of thin rice, 1,620 shi of yang indica rice, 880 shi of du indica rice, 590 shi of wu indica rice, 448 shi of white yuan, and 662 shi of dark yuan, totaling 22,070 shi.</p>

It is said that American cigarettes are extremely cheap. For example, CAMEL cigarettes only sell for a few US cents per pack in the United States. Even with the addition of freight and various taxes, the cost is low. They may soon be shipped to China for sale in large quantities.</p>

<p>Last week, rayon rose by 200,000 yuan. The market opened very flat yesterday. No. 120 Tianqiao was 950,000 yuan. Later, due to the lively trade, there were more buyers than sellers, and the price showed a sudden advance, with the highest bid being 1,075,000 yuan and closing at 1,030,000 yuan. In the afternoon, it continued to do 1,040,000 yuan, with a transaction, which was 70,000 yuan stronger than the end of last week. The distance between the stack bill and the spot goods at the end of last week was 200,000 yuan. Yesterday, the market was only 140,000 yuan short, because the authorities had already opened the stack bills held by legitimate merchants, and the goods could be shipped within days, so they competed to buy each other, and the price moved forward. The factory's retail trade was very active, and the price also progressed, about 110,000 to 120,000 yuan higher than the end of last week. The market price of silk goods and the cost calculated by the raw material price are very different. Someone searched for it, and the price advanced.

<p>Before the exchange rate was determined, the government entrusted the Foreign Exchange Department of the Bank of China to handle export settlement procedures. Up to the most recent date, the amount of settlement handled has reached a total of 2.7 million US dollars. The bank temporarily uses the ratio of 1,000 yuan of national currency to 1 US dollar and 250 yuan of national currency to 1 Hong Kong dollar. Therefore, those who buy black market foreign exchange in the market are wary of this provisional ratio and dare not buy in large quantities, taking a wait-and-see attitude.</p>

<p>[Special dispatch from this newspaper] Yarn and cloth manufacturers in this city have submitted legal and commercial difficulties through the Dyeing and Weaving Industry Association, the Cotton Cloth Industry Association, and the Yarn Industry Association for the remaining amount of yarn and cloth that was forcibly purchased by the enemy and puppets, requesting the return of the goods. The Materials Review Committee has no specific opinions on this issue, and the Enemy and Puppet Industry Processing Bureau also has no appropriate disposal methods. Yesterday, representatives of the association, such as Pan Shihao, Dong Jiufeng, Zhou Jiasheng, and Wu Mingrong, met with the Director of the Review Committee, Peng Xuepei, and the Secretary-General of the Processing Bureau, Yang, and others, and personally presented the situation of the forced purchase at the beginning and the principle that the victims should be asked to return the goods in law. Peng and Yang both expressed that the government is seriously considering it, and said that they also deeply sympathize with the yarn and cloth manufacturers' severe oppression and heavy losses at that time. According to the representatives of the association, they will collect various materials, collect the process, and list the laws and regulations, and call on all walks of life again in the near future.</p>

<p>Asphalt has suddenly become popular due to the increase in candle sales. This year is the year of victory, and the people are cheering and encouraging, and superstitious undertakings have also increased, so the candle business has been particularly lively recently. The goods prepared by each candle for the year's sales are not enough to meet the market, and they all want to purchase raw materials. Because the industry was caught off guard, they had to purchase from various production areas, so they were transported from Lanxi, Hangzhou, Jiaxing and other places to Shanghai for sale. The current market price of Lan oil has dropped from 19,000 yuan to 18,000 yuan, and Heben is 23,000 yuan. Due to the temporary failure of transportation, the spot goods are very short, and only a small number can be dealt with.</p>

<p>Since the anthracite coal chunks have sold briskly, there has been a shortage of actual goods on the market, and prices have tended to rise. Anthracite coal dust has also been pulled up in price. White coal screenings, amid a cycle of peak and slow sales, continue to weaken. White coal small pieces and coal dust remain stable. Due to the rise in anthracite coal prices, firewood has shown a slight upward trend, while regular pine and mixed firewood remain normal.</p>

<h3 id="e52">Municipal Bureau of Education Announces: Private School Tuition Fee Approval Process: Careful Study and Calculation Standards Divided into Four Aspects <a href="#e52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Daguang News Agency] The amount of tuition fees to be collected by various private primary and secondary schools in the city for the next semester has been approved and announced by the Municipal Council. To understand the process of approving these tuition fees, the reporter visited the person in charge of the Municipal Bureau of Education yesterday. It was stated that the Municipal Council had repeatedly and carefully studied the approved amounts, taking into consideration both the burden on parents and improving the livelihoods of teachers, striving to balance both sides. The calculation standards are roughly divided into the following four aspects:</p>
<p>(1) Tuition fee income will be entirely used for teacher and staff salaries. Office expenses and other costs will be the responsibility of the school board to raise. Tuition fees for reduced-fee and free students will be covered by loan and subsidy income. If these are insufficient, the school board will find a way to make up the difference.</p>
<p>(2) For primary schools, each class is calculated with 45 students, and teachers and staff are calculated with 1.5 people per class. If each student pays 6,000 yuan in tuition fees, then each teacher and staff member will receive a monthly salary of 30,000 yuan (each semester is calculated as six months).</p>
<p>(3) For junior high schools, each class is calculated with 40 students, and teachers and staff are calculated with 1.75 people per class. If each student pays 9,000 yuan in tuition fees, then each teacher and staff member will receive a monthly salary of 34,000 yuan.</p>
<p>(4) For senior high schools, each class is calculated with 40 students, and teachers and staff are calculated with 2 people per class. If each student pays 12,000 yuan in tuition fees, then each teacher and staff member will receive a monthly salary of 40,000 yuan.</p>

<p>[Report from This City] Principals of private primary and secondary schools in this city gathered again at the YMCA Hall in Baxianqiao at 2:00 PM yesterday to discuss tuition fees, salaries, and loan issues for the next semester. More than 300 schools, including Cunde, Mingde, Daozhong, Kunfan, Minguo, and Aiguo, attended. Jiang Jizhou, Yu Chuanding, and Cui Jianwu were elected as the presidium. Chairman Jiang Jizhou first gave a report, followed by a collective discussion. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Chairman's Report</p>
<p>(1) After the last meeting decided on the tuition fee standards, the Municipal Council decided on another standard, which is very different from the standards we decided on. The highest salary for primary school teachers and staff is only 25,000 yuan, and the lowest is 18,000 yuan, which is not enough to maintain their livelihoods. (2) Originally, private schools did not want to increase tuition fees, but when the municipal economy is not sufficient, there is no other way. (3) The reasons why we want to increase tuition fees are: (1) Increasing tuition fees can make excellent teachers return to school, (2) The salaries of private schools should not be lower than those of municipal schools, (3) School finances should be absolutely transparent, (4) Equal educational opportunities, so that families in better circumstances can bear more of the burden, and private schools can set up more free places.</p>
<p>Matters for Discussion</p>
<p>(1) Support the principles for the next semester proposed at the last meeting (7th) (teachers should receive the same salaries as those in municipal schools). (2) Please allocate monthly subsidies to private schools from the Municipal Government, 25,000 yuan per grade for primary schools, 30,000 yuan for junior high schools, and 35,000 yuan for senior high schools. Otherwise, in order to maintain education in this city, please raise the tuition fee standards. (3) If the subsidy has not been approved and the tuition fee standards set by the Municipal Government have not been revised by the 25th of this month, each school will issue a declaration of its own tuition fee standards and publish a joint enrollment advertisement. (4) All students studying at all levels of schools and female students studying at private primary and secondary schools in this city will be exempt from tuition fees. (5) When teachers and staff in this city are on leave for marriage, bereavement of parents or spouse, or female teachers giving birth, they will still receive their original salaries, and the salaries of substitute teachers will be paid separately by the school. (6) Each school should strictly implement financial transparency. (7) Recommend Xu Jingqing and eight others to petition the Municipal Government and the Bureau of Education. The meeting ended at 4:30 PM, and a reception was held for the press at the original location. Jiang Jizhou, principal of Minguo Girls' High School, reported on behalf of the temporary presidium, stating that the fee principles stipulated by the Municipal Bureau of Education were significantly different from the budgets of the schools. They requested that the bureau allow them to adjust the fee regulations and allocate subsidies. They also requested that newspapers not use the term "school shop" again and that they report accurately. They also requested that the hardships and demands of the private schools in the city be represented on their behalf. Principals from various schools successively expressed their opinions, and the meeting adjourned at 5:00 PM.</p>

<h3 id="e64">Over Two Hundred Business and Industry Groups in This City Issue Declaration on the Current Situation: Telegram to the Political Consultative Conference, Expressing Five Points, Hoping for Joint Advocacy from All Sectors of the Nation <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>In light of the opening of the Political Consultative Conference in Chongqing, the Shanghai business community held a symposium yesterday to discuss the current situation. Representatives from over one hundred trade associations, including the silk, rice, pharmaceutical, cotton textile (representing the sixth district of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui), wool, new medicine, paper, and rubber industries, attended. All agreed that the success or failure of this Consultative Conference is crucial to the rise and fall of the nation. The business and industry community, as a part of the citizenry, bears the sacred task of economic construction and urgently hopes that the Consultative Conference will end the situation of strife and unrest and lay the foundation for a peaceful nation-building plan. Based on the principle of "sovereignty resides in the people," it was decided that the various trade associations would jointly issue an important declaration. Mr. Luo Qinghua was immediately appointed to draft the declaration, which was signed by the representatives present. It will then be distributed to over two hundred trade associations in the city for joint sealing and mailing to the Political Consultative Conference in Chongqing. The full text of the declaration is excerpted below:</p>
<p>Solemn Declaration to the Chongqing Political Consultative Conference: As the first session of the United Nations General Assembly opens, the Political Consultative Conference convened by our National Government is also appropriately held in Chongqing at this time to seek an end to the domestic strife and unrest and to discuss a peaceful nation-building plan. Our Shanghai business and industry trade associations, in view of the fact that the outcome of this conference is truly a turning point in the rise and fall and survival of the nation, hereby, based on the principle of "sovereignty resides in the people" and "everyone is responsible for the fate of the nation," solemnly declare to all participants and compatriots throughout the country:</p>
<p>Restore Transportation, Reorganize Military (1) Restore Transportation and Reorganize Military: Ever since the Japanese warlords ignited the flames of aggression at the Beida Camp in Pan Yang on September 18th, first forcibly occupying our Northeastern territory, creating the puppet state of Manchukuo, and then gradually encroaching on North China, attempting to realize their ambition of annexing Manchuria and Mongolia, destroying China, and conquering the world, they ultimately launched a surprise attack on Pearl Harbor, triggering a full-scale World War II. During the unprecedented national crisis of the past fifteen years in our country, we faced strong enemies from abroad and internal divisions. Although under the slogan of a united national sacred war of resistance, political and military orders were never thoroughly unified, the situation of preventing division and separation was never completely eliminated, and although there was a program for resisting Japan and building the country, it was never wholeheartedly accepted by local political machines. Using this to cope with a national war of resistance unprecedented in history and to decide the fate of national survival, although fortunately allied nations jointly cooperated and justice ultimately prevailed over power, every time one looks back on the past, one still feels a crisis is imminent and shivers with fear. Since the surrender of the defeated enemy, while the world is celebrating peace, our country has unexpectedly extensively launched a civil war of mutual slaughter. In the Yellow River basin, north and south of the Yangtze River, and even in Manchuria, Mongolia, Chahar, and Suiyuan, flames of war reach the sky, people are killed in the fields, transportation is destroyed, mines are destroyed, and the remaining people are displaced. The national crisis is about to be extinguished, despite the earnest exhortations of the Allied nations. The international standing that military and civilian compatriots have obtained through eight years of bloodshed and flesh and blood is already in danger of shaking. Our business and industry sectors have suffered the pain of internal and external troubles for many years and feel it most directly and deeply. Therefore, we are most deeply resentful and painful about the civil war. Fortunately, the Three-Man Group meeting has achieved success, and the order to cease conflict and restore transportation has also been announced. Therefore, we sincerely request that all troops immediately comply with the order to cease conflict, reorganize the military, and restore transportation so that righteous people can return to their hometowns and engage in agriculture, facilitate freight transport, stabilize prices, and enable the economy and finance to return to normal as soon as possible. The government should also resolutely carry out the surrender mission in all parts of the country and quickly send enemy prisoners and expatriates back to their countries so that social order in all parts of the country can be restored and stabilized as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Resolutely Oppose the Special Status of the Northeast</p>
<p>(2) Oppose the Special Status of the Northeast: The nine provinces of the Northeast are an integral part of the entire territory of the Republic of China, rich in resources and abundant in products, and are the lifeline for our country to embark on industrialization and economic construction. Its administrative system and political facilities have always been, and will always be, indistinguishable from those of the inland provinces, and it must not be separated from the central government in the slightest. Recently, there has been talk advocating the "specialization" of the Northeast. If those people are not insane, they must have ulterior motives. It must be known that we can all recall the absurd theory of "Manchuria-Mongolia specialization" advocated by the enemy on the eve of September 18th. We are even more pained and resentful of the "North China specialization" and "autonomy of the five northern provinces" in the mouths of the enemy and traitors before and after the Tanggu Agreement. The painful lessons of history have given the people of the whole country a clear and correct understanding. Today, no conspirator should妄想妄想 inherit the old tricks. The Northeast is the Northeast of China, not the private property of any family or faction. The outdated tricks of feudal warlords playing with idols can no longer deceive the Northeast compatriots who have learned from their pain. All those who seek to dismember the national territory and sovereignty, attempt to establish separatist regimes, and cleverly promote heretical ideas aimed at brewing a second Manchukuo are resolutely opposed by us and will ultimately be condemned by the national public opinion, leading to their own destruction.</p>
<p>Hope for Wise Correction of Disguised State-Owned Enterprises</p>
<p>(3) Protecting Chairman Chiang's Economic Policy: The Shanghai business community wholeheartedly supports Chairman Chiang's new economic policy and the advocated Supreme Economic Council. If our country wants to embark on the path of democracy, prosperity, and strength, it must devote itself to economic construction, improve production technology, and improve the people's living standards. Shortly after the end of World War II, President Truman announced eight economic policies in Congress, emphasizing the maintenance of industry and commerce and the prevention of unemployment and inflation. The stones from other mountains can be used to polish jade. If our country, a country with backward production, wants to improve the lives of workers and farmers, it must first protect industrial and commercial enterprises and encourage production and export. The distorted theory of class jealousy formed by the changes in social life during the war, "No merchant is not奸," and the贱merchant doctrine must first be swept away. Our country won victory through the national war of resistance. In the future, we must mobilize the strength of the entire nation to engage in construction. Industrial and commercial entrepreneurs should even more follow Chairman Chiang's teachings, rise up together, act independently, and bear the sacred task of economic nation-building. As for the steps for economic recovery, we must first seek the recovery of industry and commerce. During the war, Shanghai's industry and commerce were the first to be devastated, and then they moved inland, supporting the war of resistance. The equipment was old and the materials were dwindling. Those who remained in Shanghai were repeatedly looted by the enemy and puppets, exhausting their ability to knock bones and suck marrow. People's strength has been exhausted, regardless of inside or outside. The business community is riddled with wounds and urgently needs to recuperate. The government should reduce and exempt taxes in accordance with the principle of cultivating tax sources and reduce its burden. We cannot agree with the fiscal policy of establishing a financial policy on the sale of factory equipment to balance the deficit. It is found that most of the factory materials of the enemy and puppet industries received by the government were taken from our country's industrial and commercial operators by the enemy. Regardless of what method was used on that day, each thing has an owner. After receiving them, the government should find out the original owner, return them all, and order them to resume work within a limited time. Those who have been newly built or added by the enemy and puppets should also be used to give priority to compensate industrial and commercial entrepreneurs who have lost factory property due to the war of resistance in front and behind the front lines in order to restore production as soon as possible. If this is not done, no matter what the excuse, whether it is to sell for profit or to become a disguised state-owned enterprise to compete with the people for profit, we believe that it is not Chairman Chiang's original intention to reward and assist industry and commerce, and it is impossible to calm people's hearts and win the trust of the public. We sincerely hope that the government will promptly make wise corrections.</p>
<p>Rewards and Punishments Must Be Clear, and People's Hearts Will Naturally Be Calm</p>
<p>(4) Stabilizing People's Hearts, Rewards and Punishments Must Be Clear: Stabilizing people's hearts is the urgent task of the present, which is generally recognized by both the government and the public. In order to achieve this goal, the first thing is to strictly distinguish between the loyal and the traitors, the obedient and the rebellious. History says, "When Emperor Gao of the Han Dynasty entered Guanzhong, he made three laws with the people to start anew, and the people of Qin were at peace." The war has ended for five months now, and the economic recovery of the recovered areas has not been restored to normal as expected in order to increase production. The reason is that half of the receiving personnel have failed to complete their tasks quickly, and the other half is due to the uneasy hearts of the people in the recovered areas, who are suspicious and watching. It is found that the Regulations on Punishing Traitors have been promulgated, and if there is any behavior in the business community that betrays the motherland, relies on the power of the enemy and puppets, and endangers others, those who have been found guilty and have solid evidence should be publicly tried and sentenced according to law in order to 重法法 discipline. If the suspicion is insufficient, the government should not implicate innocent people according to law, and the government should widely inform the public and set a deadline for reporting in order to appease those who are hesitant. Furthermore, the way of governing is to value clear rewards and punishments. Those who are guilty should be punished, and those who have made contributions should also be rewarded. During the war, there were many in the business community who destroyed their families to relieve the country's difficulties, some who assisted the war of resistance without fear of hardship and danger, and some who endured humiliation, shielded their colleagues, and covered up underground work. It seems that they should all be commended separately to encourage them. If rewards and punishments are clear, people's hearts will naturally be calm.</p>
<p>Advocating Democracy Requires the Rule of Law</p>
<p>(5) Implementation of the National Assembly and Constitutional Government: We hope that the Political Consultative Conference will smoothly achieve its task, end the situation of years of strife, and lay the foundation for peaceful nation-building. We hope that the conference will conclude satisfactorily as soon as possible, hold the National Assembly on May 5 as scheduled, implement constitutional government, and return power to the people. We advocate democracy, and we need the rule of law even more. Only through the National Assembly to return power to the people can we comply with the rules of democracy. The Political Consultative Conference is a bridge to the National Assembly, not an agency for allocating rights. We do not want the prediction of the New York Star Daily to be realized, "This situation may even be delayed for several years." We do not want to imagine "ending one-party tutelage" and replacing it with "multi-party dictatorship." Only by convening the National Assembly on schedule, implementing the Constitution, and legally producing a democratic government can we fulfill the unanimous desire of the whole country. Only farmers, businessmen, scholars, and soldiers across the country are the true masters of the country. We hope that the representatives of the Political Consultative Conference will accept our above contributions, and we hope that business groups and compatriots across the country will not give up their rights and duties as masters, unite, and jointly advocate. This is our declaration.</p>

<h3 id="e66">US Secretary of the Army Patterson Arrives in Shanghai Yesterday; Will Proceed to the Philippines After a Brief Stay in Shanghai <a href="#e66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>[Reported by This Newspaper] US Secretary of the Army Patterson, who is flying around the world to inspect the situation of US troops in various places, arrived in Shanghai from Japan via Korea at 2:50 pm yesterday. Chinese and American officials in this city went to the airport to welcome him. The enthusiastic atmosphere was no less than what was seen when General Marshall arrived in Shanghai. The Chinese officials who went to welcome him included Chief of Staff He Yingqin's representative, Director Bao Jing'an, Mayor Qian Dajun, Deputy Commander Li Jilan, Commander Zheng Dongguo, and Representative Feng Youzhen of the Central Propaganda Department. The American officials included General Wedemeyer, General Stratemeyer, Commander-in-Chief Kirk, Chief of Staff Carter, and General Brink.</p>
<p>Eight Hundred American Soldiers Petitioned on the Spot: Secretary Patterson's special plane was originally scheduled to arrive at 10 am yesterday, so reporters and welcomers from various newspapers went to the airport to wait in the morning. It was not until noon that they received a telegram stating that the special plane would arrive in Shanghai after 2 pm. Those who waited at the airport for more than four hours included a petition group of more than eight hundred American soldiers. They intended to request an audience immediately after Secretary Patterson's arrival in order to present a request for early repatriation. At 2:50 pm, Secretary Patterson's special plane landed, with sixteen American planes lined up in the air to welcome it.</p>
<p>Inspected Our Honor Guard on the Spot: After getting off the plane, General Wedemeyer and others stepped forward to shake hands. Secretary Patterson was wearing civilian clothes, a gray呢 hat, and a black coat. After shaking hands with the welcomers, he inspected the honor guard sent by the New Sixth Army to welcome him to the airport to the sound of the band playing. After the inspection, he entered the city with General Wedemeyer in the same car.</p>
<p>Mayor Held Cocktail Reception: Mayor Qian Dajun held a cocktail reception at his private residence at 6 pm yesterday to entertain Secretary Patterson. Those selected to participate included US Consul General George Atcheson, General Wedemeyer, General Kirk, General Stratemeyer, General Carter, Director Wei Jing'an, Deputy Commander Li Jilan, Deputy Mayor He Dekui, Secretary General Shen Shihua, Director Zhao Zengjue, Director Zhao Zukang, and Director Gu Yuqi.</p>
<p>American Soldiers Requested Consideration: The American soldier petition group waiting for Secretary Patterson at the airport was introduced by General Wedemeyer to meet after Secretary Patterson got off the plane. Secretary Patterson said to the representatives: I will give serious consideration to the requests of the soldiers during my stay in Shanghai. Secretary Patterson also promised to talk to the soldiers publicly today. It is heard that Secretary Patterson will stay in Shanghai for one or two days before flying to Manila.</p>
<h3 id="e67">Oppose the French Infringement of Our Sovereignty: Students Throughout the City Demonstrate and March, Demanding that the French Consulate Hand Over Cacopino <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>After the "Beldin" incident, the French side has not given a satisfactory reply to our country's protest. In order to safeguard the integrity of national sovereignty, more than 30,000 students in this city gathered at the Bund in front of the former French Embassy at 2 pm yesterday, demanding the recall of the French Consul General Fee Lihuo, the handover of the arrested French traitor, and a guarantee that similar incidents would not occur in the future. They then conducted a large demonstration.</p>
<p>Police Deployed: At that time, the Huangpu Branch dispatched a large team of police officers to set up machine guns in front of the French Embassy to protect it. The students surrounded the embassy, shouting slogans such as "Down with French Imperialism," "Hand over the French traitor immediately," and "Expel Fee Lihuo," and sang the national anthem. However, the French Consulate General had moved to Terrasse Road, and the embassy is now in Chongqing, so the French Embassy and Consulate General on the Bund were both empty.</p>
<p>Full Petition: At 2:40 pm, the large team went to the Municipal Government to petition Mayor Qian. The entire procession arrived at 3:30 pm, and five student representatives were granted an audience with Mayor Qian. Since Mayor Qian was out on official business, Secretary General Shen met with them on his behalf. The student representatives made five demands: (1) Negotiate with the French government to hand over the French traitor arrested in Shanghai, (2) Recall the French Consul General stationed in Shanghai, (3) Guarantee that similar incidents will not occur in the future and apologize to our country, (4) Take back the French Tram Company, and (5) Take back the Sino-French School. Secretary General Shen said that items 1, 2, and 3 were national issues. Before and after the "Beldin" incident, our side filed representations with the French authorities stationed in Shanghai. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has now lodged a serious protest with the French Ambassador and is conducting negotiations in Chongqing. Items 4 and 5 require further study of the plan before making recommendations to the central government.</p>
<p>Mayor's Address: At this time, Mayor Qian also heard the news and arrived. He immediately addressed all the students on the balcony, saying: "I feel very good about your actions to safeguard national sovereignty this time, but you should study hard with peace of mind, and everything should be in order and not go beyond the rules. The government will definitely do what everyone wants and make serious representations to France." All the students then shouted slogans.</p>
<p>Demonstration March: At exactly 4 pm, all the students believed that Mayor Qian's reply was satisfactory and began a large demonstration march. The procession turned from Henan Road to Nanjing Road, shouting slogans along the way and distributing the "Declaration of the Shanghai Students' Movement to Uphold China's Sovereignty Against the French Consul General's Disregard for International Law." The procession lasted for thirty minutes, and the order was good. After passing Nanjing Road along Jing'an Temple Road, they arrived at Jing'an Temple at about 5 pm.</p>
<p>The Rice Industry, Silk Industry, and more than sixty other trade associations in this city jointly telegraphed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the National Government in Chongqing yesterday regarding the French warship Beldin's private transportation of the French traitor Cacopino out of Shanghai, infringing on our sovereignty. They requested that sovereignty be safeguarded. The telegram stated: "To Minister Wang of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the National Government in Chongqing: French Consul General Fee Lihuo, disregarding our country's protest, privately used the French warship Beldin to transport the French war criminal Cacopino out of Shanghai, showing contempt for our country and infringing on our sovereignty. This is the worst of all. The Consul General, without knowing remorse, still strongly claimed that the case was a local incident, claiming that he had not received a notice from the French Ambassador to China regarding the closure of the consular court, and that before the Sino-French New Treaty was signed and took effect, the French Consul General still had consular jurisdiction. His strong arguments are the tricks of imperialism. After our country recovered extraterritoriality, we repeatedly issued orders and made a statement to the French Provisional Chargé d'Affaires in China, Peng Geguo. How could the Consul General not know this? This move is obviously an attempt to use the traditional concepts and misconceptions of the people of Shanghai towards foreigners for decades in order to create an accomplished fact and shirk responsibility. He is obstinate and unrepentant, which is extremely hateful. This case is the first major event that occurred after our country recovered extraterritoriality. The Consul General and the captain colluded with each other, resulting in this action of infringing on our sovereignty, and they should both bear criminal responsibility. If effective measures are not taken, such as countries using this case as a precedent, then various regulations on abolishing consular jurisdiction will become mere words. We dare to jointly telegraph you, Minister, requesting you to immediately lodge a serious protest, be sure to replace the Consul, formally apologize to us, and guarantee that the same situation will not occur again. Before the case is resolved, legally suspend all activities of the Consulate General and prohibit French merchant ships and warships from entering our country's ports in order to safeguard sovereignty. Our association will, if necessary, use national diplomacy to sever all economic relations with French officials and civilians in China as a retaliatory measure to urge them to reflect. The telegram is impatiently awaiting your orders. Sincerely, the Rice Industry, Silk Industry, and more than sixty other trade associations in Shanghai. Han."</p>

<h3 id="e77">Chamber of Commerce Has Concrete Opinions on Capital and Profit Tax <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>[Our Report] The issues of book capital and profit tax have long been of concern to the industrial and commercial sectors of this city. The Industrial and Commercial Laws Research Committee of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce has repeatedly studied these issues and now has concrete resolutions and suggestions to the government, which are excerpted below:</p>
<p>(1) On the issue of converting book capital, we support the three measures previously proposed by the Certified Public Accountants Association and request that the government give preferential treatment to old shareholders who were unable to participate in capital increases due to force majeure.</p>
<p>(2) On the issue of profit tax, we request that the government exempt profit tax and amend the Income Tax Law to reduce the burden on the industrial and commercial sectors. For the portion of 1945, due to the various difficulties faced by industry and commerce in the occupied areas, it is impossible to levy taxes according to the tax law.

<h3 id="e83">Special Criminal Tribunal of the High Court Tries Ling Guangyan and Others Yesterday; Accused Traitors Await Rescheduled Trials <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>[Our Report] Yesterday, the Special Criminal Tribunal of the High Court continuously tried five cases of traitors, starting from 9:00 AM. The details of each case are as follows:</p>
<p>First, Judge Zhu Zonghai ascended the bench to try the traitor Ling Guangyan, a 38-year-old from Wujiang. He graduated from Chizhi University in his early years and studied in France. Before the war, he went to Japan in a private capacity to study commercial law and married a Japanese wife. After the outbreak of the War of Resistance Against Japan, he joined the puppet organization and successively held various puppet military and political positions for up to six years. After the victory, he was captured by our military police at the Ducheng Hotel in this city. The case has been tried repeatedly, and the court yesterday presented newly received evidence stating that Ling had established a Dafafa Company gambling house and a comfort station in Suzhou, forcing our female compatriots to be ravaged by the enemy. Furthermore, on the seventh day of the first lunar month of 1943, he led the enemy to sweep through Wujiang County, resulting in the deaths of many villagers. In addition, he seized the land of the master of Suzhou's Lutai Feng Company and privately owned more than 2,000 mu of land in Wujiang and hundreds of mu in Suzhou. Ling denied all of the above crimes, but claimed that he only owned a little over a hundred mu of land in Wujiang. Because the four defendants cited by the accused had not appeared in court, and the evidence received still needs to be investigated, the hearing was postponed.</p>
<p>Further Investigation Required, Court Ordered Remand: The cases of Xue Youwen and Hu Cheng森 were also tried. Xue was 41 years old, from Nanjing, and was formerly the Director of the Fourth Section of the Puppet Police Branch Bureau on Putuo Road. He was accused of arresting youth league members Li Chengxuan and others, and was involved in various political murders during his tenure. However, he claimed that the Fourth Section was in charge of Baojia (household registration) and factories, and was not involved in espionage work. He further stated that he had not been consulted about the arrests and had even tried to release the thirteen people afterward, listing the fact that he had released our arrested underground workers. The court ordered further investigation before retrial. Hu Cheng森, a former detective at the Putuo Road Puppet Police Branch Bureau, was then questioned. He had arrested communist youth Qiu Miaoqi, which Hu admitted to in court. Because both defendants were suffering from serious illnesses, they were not questioned further and were immediately taken away. The defendants' defense lawyer applied for bail for medical treatment, but it was denied. The court ordered treatment in the prison hospital. Next, witness Li Chengxuan described in detail the circumstances of his arrest. Because it involved political secrets, the audience was not allowed to listen.</p>
<p>At 2:45 PM, the sentence for Xu Xing, a member of the puppet inspection office who oppressed villagers, was scheduled to be announced. However, Judge Liu postponed the sentencing because the facts still needed to be investigated.</p>
<p>Defendant Denies Recruiting Workers for the Enemy: Judge Cao Jun ascended the bench to hear the case of Gu Youtang, who served as a translator and recruited workers for the enemy to work in Singapore. Gu testified in court that he only served as an interpreter and had nothing to do with recruiting workers. The recruitment was handled by the Japanese technician Shimazaki Seizo and the foreman Chen Shuiyao of the factory. The court ordered that the Japanese person be summoned to testify, and the hearing was postponed.</p>
<p>Judge Liu Yugui heard the cases of Jiang Yougen and Zuo Ming, who were also accused of recruiting workers for the enemy to work in the Philippines. Jiang was the Chairman of the Lubandian Red Gang Carpenters' Union, and Zuo was a translator for the Yamahisa Company. In 1943, the Japanese Naval Attaché's Office commissioned the Yamahisa Company to recruit 180 shipbuilding carpenters from Lubandian to go to the Philippines. Jiang claimed that the recruitment was conducted by the Japanese, and that he was even beaten by Japanese military police for tearing down the recruitment notices posted in Lubandian, so he was actually wronged. Zuo Ming claimed that he had not been consulted about the recruitment and was therefore not involved. Next, the manager of the Yamahisa Company, Kuroda, and the accountant Tono appeared in court to explain everything. Later, four representatives of the Tono Carpenters' Union defended Jiang and guaranteed his past behavior. The court stated that the facts would be investigated before a retrial, and the defendants were remanded in custody.</p>
<p>Court Will Continue to Open Today: The High Court has scheduled to try the traitor Lin Meicun and Wu Yimin at 9:00 AM today, and the traitor Gan Deyun at 10:00 AM. At 9:00 AM tomorrow, the traitor Shi Xikun will be tried, and at 9:30 AM, the traitor Han Shaolin will be interrogated.</p>

<h3 id="e89">A Plea for the Children <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>— Shi Xi</p>
<p>After eight years of bitter suffering during the War of Resistance, most of our children are suffering from acute malnutrition and debilitating anemia, both spiritually and physically. Apart from a few "privileged" children who are "well-fed and chubby," the majority of children are disheveled and unkempt, malnourished "future masters of China."</p>
<p>Unfortunately, they are born into such a world: without adequate nutrition from birth, without perfect families, without progressive and rational societies, without money, without help, without space to survive, without human warmth... All they have are difficult and painful experiences, and the taste of hardship and exploitation! They live an inhuman life.</p>
<p>For the sake of our "second generation," in this day of regained light, we should make a plea for the happiness of the children:</p>
<p>First, our children need nutritious food;</p>
<p>"Food is the first necessity of the people," and children are no exception: milk powder, oatmeal, cod liver oil, eggs, fish, meat, beef, fruits, vegetables, and various foods containing calcium, iron, phosphorus, protein, and vitamins are all urgently needed nutrients. Only with adequate nourishment can children have healthy bodies and lively spirits.</p>
<p>Second, they need warm clothing;</p>
<p>The climate varies with the seasons, and children need clothing suitable for all seasons. While luxury is not required, it must be warm, easy to wear, and hygienic.</p>
<p>Third, they need comfortable housing:</p>
<p>Unclean air, crowded populations, and dirty alleys are all sources of disease. Our housing is too unhygienic. We need improved and rational housing. The design of "children's new villages" should be the most ideal home for children.</p>
<p>Fourth, they need kindergartens, garden-style children's schools, children's libraries, children's canteens, infant care centers, nurseries, welfare homes, children's health check-up centers, children's hospitals, dental hospitals, sanatoriums, children's music academies, children's theaters... All equipped with the latest scientific equipment, as well as child health care facilities, and other agencies to seek the happiness of children. The implementation of all these is what children urgently need today after the war.</p>
<p>Perhaps you say that our hopes are too extravagant, but human effort is essential. If we do not consider the future of the country and the nation, then so be it. Otherwise, we should lay a solid foundation for our "second generation" of descendants and cultivate them well, so that they are better than our generation.</p>
<p>I hear that the National Relief and Rehabilitation Administration and British children's relief organizations will soon send personnel to China to investigate the needs of children in our country in terms of relief and provide spiritual and material assistance. Although there are many organizations in various provinces and cities in our country that carry out children's welfare work and carry out various relief efforts, we ourselves feel that our economic capacity is limited and we cannot do more ideal undertakings. In this day of victory, since international people are sympathetic and willing to provide assistance to our children's relief undertakings, it is precisely the time for us to cry out loudly. I would like to present the above points as a "brick to attract jade" for appeal.</p>
<p>Random Thoughts</p>
<h3 id="e90">Not Buying It <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>— Yi Shui</p>
<p>"Not buying it" is a Shanghai colloquialism, implying contempt for the other party. If A doesn't buy B's line, it is because A doesn't take B seriously, or simply looks down on him. The reason for looking down on someone is always that A has power, has a backer, while B does not. Therefore, A can be smug and show an attitude of looking down on everything and not caring about anything.</p>
<p>At this time, the smart B will assess his own strength and, realizing that he can't win, will have to endure it. The hot-tempered one may clash head-on. The worldly one may smile it off. The proud one may break off relations from then on. The shameless one may fawn on the powerful. The calculating one will always find a way to retaliate.</p>
<p>The relationship between people is like this, and the relationship between countries is similar. It is only natural for a large country not to buy the line of a small country. It is only natural for a strong country not to buy the line of a weak country. This is a trend caused by strength. The small and weak one, even if they bow their heads temporarily, can only bow their heads for a while. Like the independence movement in Java, they will still have to bow their heads sooner or later, I think.</p>
<p>However, if an insignificant little thing, a second- or third-rate country, relies on its backer or has some sense of superiority, and reveals an attitude and fact of not buying the line of a great power after its victory, the great power, for the sake of national face, may not let it go easily, right?</p>
<p>Our nation, famous for its love of peace, just happens to encounter some outrageous friends. Could it be that the concept of semi-colonies has not been forgotten by these little things? Like the massacre of overseas Chinese in Thailand, we have not heard the next installment. This time, French warships blatantly took away prisoners from Chinese territory without a word. These friends who have someone backing them, or have a sense of superiority, still have not taken victorious China seriously!</p>
<p>Fortunately, we have always advocated peace with foreign countries, so what does this count for? Haven't we already protested! Really, what does this count for? Not buying it, fine, not buying it is fine. Ah Q said, "Haven't we already won?"</p>

<h3 id="e91">Changing Helium <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>— Ru Shui</p>
<p>Helium first came to the fore during World War I, when it was only used to fill blimps. At first, blimps all used hydrogen, but hydrogen is flammable, while helium is not. After continuous research, it has gained a place in today's industry and medicine. Now, let's introduce the uses of helium.</p>
<p>Seamen in ocean-going rescue boats often need to dive into deep water to do rescue work. In the past, they could only dive to a depth of 300 feet and stay for a few minutes, and often risked suffocation. Now, they can go to places 600 feet deep in the sea and stay for five or six hours. This is entirely due to the help of helium. Because in deep sea, the blood is subjected to external pressure, which often causes cramps and dizziness. If helium is added to the air breathed by rescuers, bubbles will not form, leading to suffocation. It is also not as easily soluble as nitrogen, so its diffusion power in the blood is extremely high.</p>
<p>Today, the best hospitals in Europe and the United States all have helium equipment. It can treat severe asthma, pneumonia, and other breathing problems. A mixture of helium and oxygen is blown into the blocked part, and helium carries the oxygen to the diseased area to facilitate breathing. In addition, helium can also be used to help newborn babies whose lungs cannot expand.</p>
<p>Anesthetics used during surgery often cause patients to die. It is said that this is because the anesthetic "explodes" in the lungs. If helium is mixed into the anesthetic, this danger will disappear.</p>
<p>Magnesium is the most ideal light metal for manufacturing aircraft. However, ordinary welding methods often do not produce satisfactory results. When the flame from the blowtorch comes into contact with magnesium, it burns out. Therefore, a helium tube is installed next to the blowtorch nozzle. When in use, the helium gas forms a layer of non-flammable gas curtain, which isolates the magnesium from the air, so the magnesium does not burn.</p>
<p>For long-range air navigation, the smaller the total weight of the aircraft, the better. Using helium to inflate tires is much lighter than using air.</p>

<p>"A scientific mind does not readily admit the word 'impossible'," Fulton said when he was planning his steamboat 'Clermont' and others called it 'Fulton's folly'.</p>
<p>"Scientific exploration and research, in itself, contains the utmost beauty, and the joy it gives is the best reward; therefore, I found happiness in my work, and originally had no other hopes..." When Madame Curie visited the United States for the second time in 1929, President Hoover and others held a grand welcome at St. Lawrence University, conferred honorary degrees, and on behalf of the entire U.S. government, presented her with a check for $50,000, saying that the American people thanked her for her contribution to mankind. Madame Curie immediately announced that she would use the $50,000 to purchase one gram of radium element to donate to the laboratory.</p>

<h3 id="e93">Life in a Dream <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>— Mei Youyun</p>
<p>People always tend to be dissatisfied with reality and long for the past. Although that "past" is clearly composed of segments of their own past "reality," they insist on saying "the past is like a dream." When they recall certain pleasant stages, they become even more immersed in the past, saying that the past is "dreamlike and lovely." But did they ever carefully experience that dreamlike and lovely past reality?</p>
<p>If one could truly view one's entire life as a dream, then isn't the unsatisfactory reality before our eyes just a fragment of that dream? Why can't we regard reality as the past, and objectively interpret everything from a standpoint detached from reality? Whether it's joy, pain, or sorrow, why must we necessarily curse it? And why accept it with a "dissatisfied" heart now, only to recall it with a "dreamlike" intoxication in the future?</p>
<p>Of course, reality is mostly unsatisfactory. Buddhists also say that this world is a Saha world, and that people born into this world must endure everything. Since everything in the present will become the past in the future, what pain or sorrow cannot be endured?</p>
<p>"In the dream, there are clearly the six realms of existence; after awakening, there is nothing in the vast world." Don't these two lines from the Song of Enlightenment also speak volumes? Although we cannot yet verify whether there is truly a soul in the "after awakening" state, if we can use what it says about the "dream" to compare it to our lives, wouldn't it alleviate many unnecessary troubles?</p>
<p>I am not saying that we should truly regard life as a dream, but rather that I want people not to torment their hearts too much with the dissatisfaction of reality. As long as one's mind and spirit have a point of focus to which they are devoted, and one moves toward that point, no matter what kind of environment one is in, if one can truly have a clear conscience, then all pain and hardship can be endured. If your spiritual devotion is beneficial to humanity, and contributes to "making this world a better place," then all suffering can be transformed into happiness, and allow you to love your reality.</p>

<p>— Yu Songyao</p>
<p>When the atomic bomb exploded over Hiroshima, six Japanese soldiers were sitting on a long bench, their backs against a brick wall. Their backs were facing the epicenter of the explosion, about one kilometer away, and the eaves and a small hill shielded part of their bodies.</p>
<p>Therefore, they did not die from the shock wave of the atomic bomb like other victims, or be burned by the flash, nor were they directly killed by Y-rays. The next day, all six were admitted to the hospital. Five of them died within 48 hours of admission – the cause of death was said to be probably due to the radioactive particles scattered in the body during the explosion. Only one person is still alive.</p>
<p>In the past few weeks, scientists have been carefully studying everything about this living "atomic man," such as his diet, living habits, and ancestral background – in order to find a way to survive the next great war.</p>

<p>— A Yu</p>
<p>On November 23rd last year, U.S. Army engineers in Japan used hammers, iron melting tools, and crowbars to dismantle Japan's largest atom smasher in seven hours. The parts were loaded onto cargo ships and dumped into the sea at a depth of 4,000 feet. At the same time, in the vicinity of Tokyo, four other smaller smashers were also destroyed.</p>
<p>If Eisenhower's order had arrived sooner, those massive instruments would not have met this unfortunate fate. Eisenhower's order was to transport that 200-ton machine to the United States, as it was originally purchased from the United States in 1938.</p>
<p>But the order arrived too late. American atomic scientists are blaming General McVorsey for "being foolish and reckless, committing a crime against humanity." They said that Japan's atom smasher was for research purposes, not for making atomic bombs. McVorsey calmly argued that it was not his idea, and he was acting on the orders of his "superior." No one questioned who the "superior" was.</p>

<p>To the Editor: Yuan Xizhen purchased 200 shares of the China Raw Hide Company in October of the 32nd year of the Republic through the Hengsheng Company established by Tao Heng, totaling 200,000 storage currency. At the time, Tao Jun, due to insufficient funds, persuaded Xizhen to purchase half the amount, totaling 100,000 storage currency. A share contract was established by the Hengsheng Company established by Tao Jun. At the same time, Tao Jun added his private seal to the contract as proof. However, to this day, over two years have passed, and Tao Jun has never informed Xizhen about the company's contents. Xizhen has never been given the benefits she is entitled to, and despite repeated inquiries, Tao Jun has always delayed. Unexpectedly, Tao Jun had been planning for a long time and suddenly, after the victory, changed the name of Hengsheng Company to Tonghai Hide Company. Tao Jun still manages the business, but he neither added the seal of Tonghai Hide Company to the previous contract nor hired a lawyer to publish an advertisement saying, "The China Raw Hide Company has suspended business due to the current situation. Whether it will continue to operate is up to the company to decide," etc. Upon hearing this, Xizhen was extremely perplexed, as Xizhen is a woman who is unfamiliar with business investment and does not understand legal issues. She trusted Tao Jun only because he promised her benefits and repeatedly persuaded her, so she did not hesitate to sell her family property and entrust it to him. Moreover, after the previous investment, Xizhen's family property has been severely depleted, resulting in a difficult life for her family. However, Tao Jun, with his wealth and power, bullies a woman and disregards the contract he established. Xizhen originally intended to sue in court, but she is unable to afford the legal fees required to hire a lawyer. She wonders if there are any righteous lawyers in this city who would handle the case pro bono and file a lawsuit according to the law, so that Xizhen's family can eke out a living. Therefore, she requests your newspaper to grant a space to disclose this case to uphold justice and provide relief. She sends her regards with endless anticipation.

<p>Editor: Reading the widow's appeal for justice for her husband in your column, I learned that Mr. Qian was mistaken for a gangster at night, leading to his escape, and was shot and killed by Xu Xianzong, a judicial officer of the police station. The officer treated the people with a frontline battlefield style and forgot the duty of a public servant of the people. Please, people from all walks of life, support this cause. I express my utmost sympathy for protecting human rights and offer 10,000 yuan as a gesture to encourage others to help the most grieving widow and orphan in the world. I hope that knowledgeable people in Shanghai will help the most painful widow and orphan and that enthusiastic lawyers will volunteer to file a lawsuit for the widow to eliminate malicious crimes against the people and punish the police officer's illegal behavior by law. Please, Editor, uphold justice and benefit the people. The money will be transferred to the Qian family at your expense. Best wishes. Wang Respectfully. The 10,000 yuan donated by Mr. Wang is now stored here. We hope that Mrs. Qian will bring the receipt with the seal to the library to collect it. (Editor)</p>

<p>Editor: We just moved back to our original location in Shanghai from the countryside of Suzhou to resume classes. While in the countryside, we heard from a friend that a journalism school was founded in Shanghai after the victory of the Anti-Japanese War. We, a few colleagues, are greatly interested in this school and would like to visit it first before enrolling. However, we are unfamiliar with the address. Although we have inquired in various places, we have not been able to find it. We hope you can tell us the school address and will be eternally grateful. Shengquan</p>
<p>(Answer) The school address is inside the Sino-French Institute of Technology on Fuxing Road, south of Avenue Road.</p>
