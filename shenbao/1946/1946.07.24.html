<p>位於江西北部的廬山，領大嶺七重，而磅礴五百華里，是亞洲避暑的勝地，是中國的夏都，抗戰的溫床，建國的礎石。以言氣勢，則雄奇俊偉，不足喻其大；說到風景，則片石孤岑，皆挾烟雲氣。明萬衣望廬山詩云：「祥雲靄靄三千丈，佳氣垂垂二百年。」其氣象形景有如此，實足盪人心目，攝人魂魄，令人有超然出塵之想。因是我們的最高領袖蔣主席，在抗戰以前數年，入夏以後，每藉署期休假之便，一臨斯山，稍事休憇。誰也知道廬山的夏季氣候，平均只有七十五度，氣候是如此的凉爽，風景是異常的優美，在火傘高張，溽暑蒸人的南京住久了的人，一登此山，不僅煩熱盡去，俗念皆消，而以氣候掠爽，精神振奮，工作興趣亦陡然爲之提高，因是追尋工作，努力工作發揚蹈厲，不能自己，所以蔣主席一到夏季，總想鼓勵許多靑年，利用署假來廬進修。主席本人登山以後，他老人家不但精神健旺飯量大增，而且因爲體力充沛，步履更健，不時孤筇雙履，微服出遊；或則漫步花徑，一遊白鹿昇仙臺；或則探勝蒼崖，野餐御碑亭；或則觀瀑石門，遙望塞遝荆榛，看怒濤激流，飛起飛落，而低顯沉思；或則西望太乙，命駕含鄱口，佇觀日落月出，雲散霧消，而頷首微笑。但是主席對於廬山的愛慕，尙不祇此，人們從主席的言行，可以領悟到主席對於廬山靈氣所鐘的一種端嚴淸凈的氣氛，是非常的喜悅，非常的愛慕。誰也不會忘記，中國的抗戰天計是於九年前的今天，在廬山決定的，誰也能够想到中國建國的大計，也許會在今天明天後天或者是不久的將來，將歲溫九年前的那一課，尤其是當馬歇爾元帥司徒大使上山的那一天，人們都像預感到在司徒大使呈遞國書以後，局勢或者會明朗一點了。依然保持一種學者風度的司徒大使，在十九日下午七時十五分，也曾經對記者說過：「中國老百姓太苦悶了，蔣主席很知道民衆的痛苦，將於二三日內發表一個文吿。道是一件必需要說要做的事情，不過，就目前情勢言，或者還要再等幾天，然而我們宵旰憂勤的主席，他老人家身在匡廬，心在國家，念念不忘民衆痛苦，這一種大仁大度，已經感動人天，令人感泣。具體的說法，就是當中國共產黨在晋南，晋北，豫西，鄂北，膠東，蘇北，掀起戰火，殘民以逞的今天，主席還是以一種偉大的博愛精神，期望共黨覺悟，仍然主張以政治方式解決中國共產黨這一個令人苦惱的問題。據聞，當主席與馬帥司徒大使就此一問題會談兩次，表示這一種慈祥態度的時候，馬帥和司徒大使均爲感動。司徒大使辭出後，對人談話時，見面即盛讚主席偉大仁愛，譽爲「人類之救星」。司徒大使在中國辦學數十年，對於中國的歷史，有深刻的認識，對於漢朝的黄巾之亂，民初的白狼之禍，前者他會在書本上看得出一點興亡之轍，後者發生的時候，他已經到了中國，現在這一位深明中國國情的司徒大使已經回到南京去了。還有一位馬歇爾元帥，也已在廿二日下山飛返南京，昨天（廿一日）蔣主席夫婦曾經陪同馬帥夫婦暢遊仙人洞。馬帥返京後，南京的沉寂空氣，或許要熱鬧一點，而在廬山的人們，一般的看法，則有兩說：有的說如果中共仍舊堅持軍事割據的要求，硬不退出蘇北和膠東各地，這個僵局還是打不開，那時司徒大使只好留在北平，順便照顧他摯愛的燕大，那時說不定馬帥要回到華盛頓去走一遭。有人說，中共如能適時覺醒，改變他的基本態度，放棄武力迷夢，開誠與政府商談一切待決之問題，尤其要停止蘇北各地之攻勢，談判仍可重開，和平也不致絕望。現在又像到了一個「最後關頭了」，這是記者在山上所聽到的一鱗半爪的消息。此外，關於蔣主席的山居生活，也値得介紹：據聞，主席登山後，每天至遲在六點半起身，依然用冷水洗臉，盥洗後，作十餘分鐘的運動，七點以後，讀聖經，八點以後看晨報（中央日報廬山版出版後，每晨在山已有報看，）閱報以後，有時披閱重要文件，而進晨餐的時候，大槪在十點前，下午的時間，大部是披閱重要報吿，閒下來就看書，看有益的書。</p>

<p>社論</p>
<h3>田賦征實平議</h3>
<p>自中央決定田賦征實繼續一年以來，聞各地參議會和人民團體頗有反對，要求免予征實。或以為政府實地征實政策，政府所得之實惠少，而民間所受之滋擾多，似非政府之本意，或以為政府不從穩定幣值，抑平物價上打算，却不肯放棄田賦征實，其結果將轉使民族經濟愈趨枯竭。凡上所言，容有部份的真理，值得政府注意。現在秋收在望，田賦即將開征，而繼續征實一年，又為中央既定的決策；我們盱衡民生疾苦，政府苦心，對此問題，實覺有一言的必要。</p>
<p>從基本觀點上言，田賦的征收，舊習相沿，與現代的租稅觀念既多出入，與三民主義的土地政策亦未盡合；故究極言之，傳統的田賦制度應在廢棄之列，而代之以與我土地政策相符的土地稅。衹因土地整理需時，以致田賦的征收，不得不暫予保留，以為過渡期的一種權宜辦法。這是必須認識的一第一點。既然是一種權宜辦法，在作戰時期，政府為了供應軍糧公糧，必須掌握實物，因而有田賦改征實物的決策。這一決策的實行，雖不無執行上的流弊間或苛擾人民，但從國家的觀點言，却使軍公糧供應無缺，對於持久戰的進行和勝利的獲得，確有很大的貢獻。目下勝利已臨，表面看，似無繼續征實的必要，可是現實局勢依然不甯，國內交通既謂暢復，民族經濟的危難又未稍舒，政府決定田賦征實繼續一年，事非得已。我們知道政府要為國家辦事，須負責任，一種決策自必考慮再三而後定。我們首先應該諒解政府決策的苦心，然後來減免征實可能發生的流弊。</p>
<p>我們更應該指出的，就是田賦征實繼續一年這一決策，在經濟觀點上，比較是明智的決策。由於應付作戰而激起的通貨發行的增加，已使物價及一般經濟生活起了劇烈的波動。我們的惡性通貨膨脹雖還沒有達到如匈牙利那樣可怕的境地，但就現有的情況言，我們的惡性通貨膨脹已使政府人民交感其困。當前政府的第一要務，是在儘可能的不再擴大通貨的發行，加重經濟的危難。但現有的局勢使政府未能澈底整理通貨，若於此際而再無限制的擴大通貨的發行，則民族經濟的趨於崩潰，將不復可救。田賦征實展期一年，就含有使政府不因糧食問題而擴大發行通貨的意義。假使政府停止田賦征實，則軍糧公糧的供應，勢必以現款購自民間；為購備軍公糧，市面上勢必增加數千億的法幣。此其結果，直接受害者將仍是人民。田賦征實，可以減少通貨的發行，更進而減少游資在市場上的作崇。由經濟上的觀點來說，田賦征實在此時還是需要的政策。</p>
<p>因之，在這個時候，我們對於田賦征實繼續一年之舉，在原則上，不應一味反對。但這決不是說我們也得將與田賦征實以俱來的種種執行上的流弊依然繼續保留一年。收糧手續的繁複，分配負担的欠公平，都應該調整和簡化。此外征糧時的種種流弊，如帶秤加皮，踢斗拍斗，升邊降底，刨斗挖盪，滲和秕穀，強索車餘等等，應該懸為厲禁，查明嚴辦，庶幾可以平民憤，安民心。至於吏屬的不法貪污，杖勢淩人，尤應加強監察組織，嚴明賞罰。而有些省區，如江浙田賦，科則獨重，如果調整不及，衹有量為核減，方昭公允。總之，田賦征實，原所以欲國計，應該儘量避免擾民；方不負國家的一番至意。再則，各地如有災難，亦當簡化勘報手續，一遇報災，可由省先行核定減免，庶幾災民能夠得到實惠，其生命不致為一片官腔所葬送。</p>
<p>關於田賦征實繼續一年的決策，蔣主席在財政收支系統會議席上，原已一再申明，況　主席關懷民瘼，對於征實執行上的防制流弊，亦曾迭有指示。我們希望田賦征實的延長，能將歷年的積弊掃淨，尤盼各地監察使署認真監察，使田糧征收得以弊絕風清，則人民必能增加對於政府的信任和愛護，必如此，中國纔能走上建國大道　向民族復興的鵠的邁進。</p>

<h3>耶路撒冷炸彈事件　英政府極為重視　死傷數字現增至九十人　猶太移民案受嚴重影響</h3>

<p>〔法國新聞社耶路撒冷廿三日電〕此間大衛王旅館英軍總部昨日發生空前爆炸案，巴勒斯坦猶太人為之駭然。並引起一致憤慨。此次爆炸案為巴勒斯坦最大之陰謀破壞行動，截至目前為止，查明有軍民六十人罹難，內有英政府高級人員數人。猶太人對於此種慘案惟有目瞪口呆而已。彼等惟恐此項罪行將引起全世界之憤慨，甚至在猶太主義同情者之間，亦將不免。據調查所得，恐怖份子喬裝小阪，混入旅館底層，此輩一共五人，均穿阿拉伯人服式，攜帶牛奶罐頭，內藏炸藥。暴徒看守旅館人役後，即將炸彈放入運貨電梯內，此輩旋又前往接連旅館之英兵夜總會，途遇英軍官一人攔阻，當即將其擊傷。暴徒至夜總會，將人役一概驅逐，然後安置另一炸彈，事畢，暴徒逃出旅館，乘坐二百碼以外等候之汽車一輛揚長而去。旅館方面雖拉警鈴，警察亦立即趕到，但已不及逮捕兇手矣。大衛王旅館五層大廈經此爆炸，一角完全被毀，該旅館設備之佳，在中東首屈一指，旅館內部現已淩亂不堪。</p>

<p>[法國新聞社華盛頓廿二日電〕國務院發言人稱：美國承認玻國新政府，係有兩項原則，即（一）新政府應首能證明其確能維持治安及尊重法律，（二）新政府必須保證遵守前政府所締結之國際協定。</p>

<h3>英在新加坡　擴建要塞　使成為遠東軍事基地　利用二萬日俘築營房</h3>
<p>〔路透社新加坡廿三日電〕戰爭及印度政局之變更，巴使新加坡自衛軍基地戰為軍事根據地，一九四一年十二月日軍攻新加坡時，馬來亞竟來有防黎工事之設，英軍既無一輛坦克車，亦無一尊平射砲，皇家空軍亦殘缺不全，此項現象預料不致再見於他日。新加坡今後當成整個東南亞之軍事中心根據地。不僅容納海軍而已。據星島防守司令柯克斯少將稱，當英國在東亞之主要基地設在印度時，新加坡僅備有少量軍火，今後當予大量增加，於發生戰爭時，可供長期抗戰，星島乃通至遠東各地及澳洲之門戶，必須使其成為遠東之基地。在相當時期內，新加坡當保持相當數量之駐軍。日俘二萬名正在奉令為英軍建築營房，目前新加坡一地之駐軍，有四萬五千名之眾。</p>

<h3>土肥原罪跡昭彰　秦德純昨再出庭作證</h3>
<p>〔中央社東京廿三日專電〕我國防部次長秦德純將軍今晨二度出席國際法庭作證，對土肥原辯護律師司城直宜所作之辯護辭，予以反駁稱：「東北之勞倫斯」土肥原，向使宋哲元將軍及渠彌感頭痛，土肥原在華北所施壓力，頗為猛烈，宋氏及渠雖為維持華北和平而同意冀察政務委會之設立，但從未支持華北之「自治運動』。司城直宜至此遂出示中國畫一卷，并稱：該畫係由宋哲元將軍贈與土肥原者，以「感謝其合作』。當該畫在秦氏面前打開時，秦氏面露微笑，立即答稱：「此卷國畫係土肥原離華時所贈者，屬國官員，交換禮物，在我國乃極普通之事，故绝不能以此作為有利被告之證據」司城又圖解釋九年前日軍在中國領土舉行夜間軍事演習之事為合法之行為，謂：辛丑條約中，曾規定予日本以在中國領土內舉行軍事演習之特權，秦氏即廢以「然則中國事先應廢通知，地方當局始可佈告當地居民週知。」司城至此　又圖解釋日軍之侵略我國為合理者，渠指出，七月廿九日之通州，及七月廿六日之北平二次射擊事件。關於此點，秦氏駁以射擊之事，於一九三七年七月八日清晨，即已開始，通州及北平二次射擊事件，發生於七月八日之後，直至去年戰爭結束時始行停止。並謂：渠稱土肥原為潘陽事變之指使者，係根據我國情報及其他各方報告。今日被告松井石根之辯護律師，在法庭聽取秦德純將軍作證時，指出宋哲元，韓復渠及秦氏三人，均會參加大東亞會議，秦氏駁復謂：余知有一人曾參加，此人即在我國因叛國罪，而被需鞫之齊變元。</p>
<h3>原子彈再試期近　靶子艦艇位置巳排定　爆炸時船隻將盡吸入海底</h3>

<p>〔聯合社記者船阿派拉欽號廿二日電〕原子彈試驗科學技術部主任蘇易預料，海戰將發生新現象，彼時艦船將先被吸入水底，然后在瘋狂的角度上拋出水面。當第五枚原子炸彈在水面下爆炸時，似將有一百萬噸乃至一千萬噸之海水拋入空中造成直徑一千呎高十呎之水柱。水面將開一大窟窿，深達百呎。附近艦船均將吸入此一窟窿之內。</p>

<h3>金磚案開審　六被告同時提案　陳元盛當庭供認　投機失敗起盜心　候審室中神經刺激　一度哭笑無常</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕中央銀行金磚巨竊案主犯陳元盛，昨日下午由鍾顯達推事在地院刑二庭開審。昨晨八時半，當陳犯由法警數名從思南路看守所押至北浙江路地方法院時，忽在地院之候審室內，大發神經病，哭笑無常，語無倫次。下午二時三刻，提到法庭又恢復正常。陳元盛延孫立時律師辯護，其餘被吿吳明剛，王樹梅。陳有慶，施祥隆，兪時揚等亦各延律師辯獲。二時三刻正，審訊開始，陳元盛供稱：三十歲，浙江人，民二十二年進中央銀行，犯案前任保管科職員，當時底薪六十元，依生活指數，每月所得約十四五萬元。家有老母及兄姊各一，未曾分居。金磚等係保管科主任交他保管，因所賺薪水不能養活家庭，故做投機，先偷竊股票和美鈔，因　空而偷金磚公債，以謀彌補。金磚最初押與前中央銀行同事，今上海市銀行襄理潘家鏐，利息一角六分。因到期後未贖回，便由彼方賣掉。丙種公價則放給兪時揚，兪係做交易時認識。陳犯並稱金磚上有「滿洲國中央銀行」英文字樣，去杭州時所携帶者爲三根十雨金條，四千美亞股票，三十萬現款。</p>
<p>吳明剛　供稱：三十三歲，四川人，上海重慶銀行襄理，抵押金磚係潘家鏐介紹，因對潘信任，故未細看，金磚係上海巿銀行營業科副科長楊德惠拿來，因銀行公會曾有通知，金磚可做押款，故收受。利息一角三分半。</p>
<p>王樹梅　供稱：三十四歲，寗波人，做股票生意，由潘家鏐介紹用本人名義去抵押金磚，因對潘信任，故不問金磚來源，賺利息二分半，其餘賣掉之事則未知。</p>
<p>陳有慶　供稱：二十六歲，鎭江人，四川路三泰銀號副經理，購買金磚事係於五月四日從上海巿銀行營業科副科長楊德惠手中以每條一百六十一萬五千之價格購進，因信任楊德惠，故未細究金磚來源，此金磚後由祥和銀樓鎔化爲小塊門莊售出。</p>
<p>施祥隆　供稱：三十五歲，餘姚人在祥和銀樓任事，與陳有慶有來往，故相識，五月四日親手收入金磚，曾打開看過，惟不識英文，得鎔化費四錢五分三金子。</p>
<p>俞時掦　供稱：做錢莊生意，最初不知陳元盛係中央銀行職員，陳於五月二十二日謂欲將寄存之公債出售，但並未賣出。陳元盛又供：公債係分四包，內有中央銀行封條，做投機僅二三月，公債未曾賣過。先拿美金做，後來才押金磚以補美金。至此庭上傳訊市銀行襄理潘家鏐，供稱：吳縣人，民國二十四年與陳元盛同係中央銀行練習生，故相識。因陳堅求要帮忙設法弄款，故爲彼介紹抵押金磚。</p>
<h3>中行附帶私訴　要求賠償金磚</h3>
<p>時中央銀行業務局副局長舒志觀代理律師左德　起立提出附帶民訴部分，要求五被吿共同賠償金磚四百五十三兩二錢三分，陳元盛單獨賠償五百三十五萬八千四百九十二元八角一分。公債部分因已歸達，故不求賠償。至此鍾推事途宣吿改期再審。</p>
<p>〔又訊〕據被吿律師孫立時表示，陳元盛係中央銀行業務局保管　臨時　員，末有委任狀，故不能照公務員身份起訴，且陳係因投機失敗而犯罪，實社會環境所使然耳。</p>

<h3>朱學範談　莫斯科印象　人口衆多　工作緊張　高跟鞋燙頭髪　蘇聯婦女不能例外</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕全世界五十五國七千萬工人組織之「世界工會聯合會，」本年六月中旬在莫斯科召開第一次執行委員會議，我國代表由中國勞　協會理事長朱　範出席參加大會會議日程共五大，閉幕後，蘇聯總工會並曾招待全體出席代表二十七人，巡禮列寗格勒。本月九日朱氏由莫斯科轉道海參崴，搭翰返國二十一日安抵滬埠。</p>
<p>昨日午後，朱學範氏向本報記者暢談列寗格勒與莫斯科觀感。列寗格勒，這個擁有三百餘萬人口的大都市，是一個千千萬萬噸貨物的吞吐港，英國來的煤與機器，美國來的棉花，都在這裏進口，換出了木材。戰時的悲慘破壞情形，現在已恢復了平時狀態，建築物已經修復百分之九十以上，僅近海口處尙未重建。戰士多已復員歸來，因此顯得空前的擠，目前最感緊迫的還是住的問題。</p>
<p>對蘇聯目前的一般情形，朱氏說：「一個普通工人每月大約可得工資二百五十盧布（官價是一元美金換五·三〇盧布），技術工人可得二三千不等，而薪水最高的科學院的大學士們，幾乎有三萬以上，一切物價俱受統制，購買數量也有限額，除非你有餘錢，方能以高過官價十倍八倍的價目，向商店多買一些配給以外的物品，生產偏重於重工業及必需品的製造，進口貨中難得發現奢侈品。在上海市上隨處能買到的花旗蜜橘，蘇聯是沒有的，甚至往返上海海參崴間的航輪也都是帶足了他們的國產食物，絕不在國外購辦。」但是莫斯科大道上也有穿高跟鞋，漫頭髪的婦女，她們也愛修飾，只是比較一般世界大都市少吧了。大多數職業婦女的服裝打扮還是戰時一樣的樸實，莫斯科有二家大飯店也備舞池，娛樂有歌劇與巴蕾。好萊塢電影在那邊也有大量的觀衆。朱氏對草斯科有兩個印象：人多，（有人口六百一萬）工作緊張，現在已開始了第四個五年計劃。</p>
<p>這時，記者發出了最後一個問題：「是不是蘇聯還是跟以前一樣嚴密的統制着新聞。」我得到的是肯定的回答，他說：「是的，他們還是統制新聞。常我們在莫斯科開完了大會，曾招待各國記渚，其時曾有個英國記者問，執委會是否要檢查，蘇聯總工會代表如此答覆：假如全照事實發電便通過，否則便扣留，可見蘇聯還是檢查新聞電的」至於什麼是事實，什麼不是，大約將根據檢查者的主觀而定了。</p>

<h3>財次徐柏園發表談話　四聯總處存廢問題　五千萬以下貨款各行得自決</h3>
<p>近來滬報間有以四聯總處任務業已完成，應予解散者，據財部政務次長兼四聯總處秘書長徐柏園氏稱，存廢問題，未便表示任何意見，至成立經過及主要工作，則謂總處係於八一三滬戰爆發後在滬成立，主要任務爲聯合四行力量，安定金融，支持長期抗戰，故成立後，即在各重要商埠設立分支處及聯合貼放委員會，　政府西遷，各行總處分設渝港，爲求各行間步調一致，切實協助政府，推行國策起見，中央於廿八年秋，頒布鞏固金融辦法綱要，提高總處職權，加强組織，而中信郵匯兩局業務，亦先後劃歸總處督導，最高領袖兼理事會主席，由財政經濟交通糧食各部首長四行總裁副總裁董事會總經理分任理事，辦理生產事業貸款，擴大農業貸款，推行各種備蓄，統籌調撥軍政匯款，集中鈔券發行，劃一各行會計，實行行局業務劃分，督促行局辦理復員，以及全國金融網之敷設等重要工作，至總處各種政策方針之決定，及各項貸款案件之處理，均先提交各種小粗，經由各行主管業務人員及有關首長參加意見，至於總處性質實在是各行局之聯合體，其使命一則求各行局業務之配合與協綢，二則溝通國家金融方針與政府經濟政策，求其密切配合，三則不斷策劃金融經濟的各項實施，多方推動，本人敢說總處成立後，四行兩局通力合作，對國家集體之貢獻賣在不少，還都不久一般人士對總處情形或有未盡明瞭之處，對於辦理各種貸款，外界以手續緩慢，不易核准，而核准數額，多有不能適應需要者，氏謂此種批評，在渝即有所聞，本處核辦貸款，一向依照規定原則，公平辦理，貨款數額，視廠家實際需要核定之，凡申請貸款，只要申請書表齊備，以及其餘條件合格者，莫不迅速處理，最近復經訂定五千萬元以下之貸款，即由各行局逕自核定，承放手續，更可簡便，但行局資力並非無限，對工商事業之貸款，在國家金融經濟政策下，亦不能不照一定標準，稍加決擇耳</p>

<p>外幣普遍受央行公吿，現鈔可抵結匯之用，買見見活，晨開二五三〇元買價起求過於供，中途稍有曲折，高價升至二六四〇元後，以實貨稍有流出，午刻又降至二五八〇元左右徘徊，午後稍有回上，結果較前收升七十五元，港票先堅後平，曾升至五七〇元以上，結果較前收好八元，港匯五六〇元左右，印匯六八〇元左右，英匯九千元左右，美匯仍乏特殊活動。</p>

<h3>美國物價飛漲　兩週內漲百分廿五</h3>
<p>〔美國新問處華盛頓廿二日電〕白宮今日公佈商務部之文吿稱，物價管制機關六月卅日撤廣後，農產品及輸入品實應担負刺激通貨膨脹之最大責任，據商務部呈送與杜魯門總統之經濟調查報吿，勞工統計局之每日行情指數表，顯示在七月最初十六日間，廿八種主要商品漲價百分之廿五，補助金之取銷雖爲物價上漲原因之一，惟物價上漲數率實較前此之補助金爲高，此種情形，尤以牲畜價格爲甚，目下穀類，牛肉，牛油，鉛及鋅之價格已較一九一九年第一次大戰結束後爲高，最近物價全面上漲之詳情，迄未全部明瞭，物便管　處雖有重新設立之議，惟物價漲風仍未因而稍戢，報吿之結論謂：「若無恢復物價管制處之議，物價漲風恐較今日尤甚。」</p>

<h3>訪江灣機塲</h3>
<p>— 朱民威</p>
<p>毛尙貞隊長駕着吉普，這車上很空，只坐着記者一個客人。他的車子跳躍地在他的隊部路上轉到江灣機塲路上，進入中美憲兵守衛的哨崗以後，路就坎坷的敗露着日夜行車的磨折痕跡，就是這個機塲，自天空接收了後方的險要與勇士，如今人們進人煩嚷鬧市，自然不要再去想到登陸的荒漠。</p>
<p>中尉飛行員</p>
<p>我們循着用完的汽油空筒排成的車道路標　行，在一座同樣荒寂的指揮　中，他介紹他的作戰參謀竺培風與我談談，竺培風是空軍裏一個中尉飛行員，從第十六期空車軍官學校畢業以後，就派到空軍第一大隊担任見習官，飛行員，他早在二年前就以他個人特出的故事吸引人不得不注意他，原來他在與一般年靑小伙子同在美國學習軍事航空以前，他平已在英國劍橋大學得過工程學士及碩士學位。</p>
<p>我們見面的時候，仙正在寫字台旁計劃航綫，一個美國軍官在旁等着，在他了給這件事，他便站起來和我談着，我打量了一下，他是一個中等高度寬壯身材的人，比他同時學飛的同學們年紀要大，後來談得很熟，他說到他的年歲是三十二歲。</p>
<p>冒險的任務</p>
<p>爲了要看他們現在用的Ｃ-46式飛機，毛尙貞換了一部中型吉普。瘦瘦的毛隊長本來就鬧傷風，但他很願勉强自己身體服從自己待客的意旨，指揮樓到停機區域的道路一樣不好，他依然疾，由疾轉慢，煞車，開行的在壞路上開着車子，儘管是初夏，曠野裏的風挾了沙塵迷人眼間的拂來，我們說的話一會兒就被風吹刮掉而聽不清楚。</p>
<p>在車上，竺培風說到他在英國本來學土木工程，在劍橋得碩士學位以後，轉到美國，在美國，他看到航空事業在社會上的領導地位，就入法美航空公司（P.AA.）天文領航學校學天文　航行，那位老師也就是早一年做衣復恩老師的老天文航行專家完成這種民航學程以後，竺培風看到世界上的戰爭還未解決，許多人都投効空軍做一已的貢戲，他索性也決心做一個軍事航空員來盡點當兵的義務，他得到空軍當局特准考入空軍學校第十六期在美受飛行訓練，一年畢業，立即回國分發空軍第一大隊，担在Ｂ29轟炸機駕駛員，在四川梁山湖南芷江，陝西漢中安康等基地出繫豫鄂湘桂等地敵陣，八個月的作戰他完全像一般年靑人樣做冒險的任務，毫不因爲自己是一個學成的工程人材而例外。</p>
<p>兩小時飛行</p>
<p>抗戰勝利後，他奉派赴美考入美空軍參謀大學特別班受訓，六個月的期限，除了術科以外，學科方面有足够中國普通大學讀四年的三四十種課目書籍要在限期內讀完提出研究報吿，這在他因爲早已留學英美多年，所以能以勝任愉快的如期繳卷。</p>
<p>竺培風小的時候，就在上海過都市生活，南市九畝地萬竹小學是他的童年時代的受敎地，原籍浙江奉化去的時候很少，鄕野生活倒是在空軍部隊作戰時候過了一陣。</p>
<p>我們車停在Ｃ-46停機區域，美國人不斷撤離中國，這些舊的Ｃ-46也就一批一批由航綫上集聚到江灣這一塊土地上來，我看了一下，這一大片約莫有當年四川新津基地使用Ｂ-29炸日本九州時所用的空運機那麼多。毛尙貞隊長把我領到他今天所飛的那一架駕駛艙中，講了點肓目落地儀器用法及駕駛法給我聽，他今天飛行課目是起落，起與落一共十二次，共是二小時飛行，落地開油門即起飛昇空後又落地，他預定在一個星期內可以完成全部Ｃ-46飛行課目訓練，傷風也不停歇</p>
<p>參觀器料庫</p>
<p>跨出飛機，他引我去看他自己設計的第一大隊空運機器材庫，我看到一坐大倉房里從飛機輪胎到電咀全套零件井井有條的展列着，這個隊長他儘量發揮自己管理　務的能力他說：「我們在作戰時代，一切不管，只要專心飛行作戰，因爲戰爭第一，加上戰爭的殘酷，若果分心於瑣碎事務，生命或許就火化在飛機的破片里，可是此刻是戰後，我們的專心必需轉移到隊務上來，周至柔將軍累以此相訓，我們這些三十來歲人似乎也應該把事務管得合理而免除浪費，因此，到滬接收美軍空運訓練以來，我連自己的飛行都延到今天才開始，可是我得到了指揮下屬的許多辦法並且開始學習管理。</p>
<p>光明的兵隊</p>
<p>我們一同由江灣入巿區時，竺培風參謀在隊部與我們分手，在車座中，尙貞說：一這個人令人有點敬佩，他像我們同期的翁心翰一般，有着可以不需奮門即可事受聲譽的家世關係但他默默的做着他所愛好的低級職務，一點一滴的餘生命來充實自己的歷史。他的舅父，在聽到他的學飛企圖時，心中感到的是微微滿足的愉快，讓他這個外甥流着汗，在美國沙漠區的高度驕陽下悶在鐵飛機裏上上下下的受磨練吃苦。這過去三年的辛勞與危險不是白過，他已贏得空軍當局的讚美與空軍同袍的交譽，我頗以能得他協助隊務爲榮，你說對嗎？」</p>
<p>「是的，空軍裏有你們這些而性人來充任幹部，這支空中兵隊是可以預見光明的」。我沒說出要說的話，說話對於事實是多餘的。</p>

<h3>船舶登記的秘密</h3>
<p>編輯先生：</p>
<p>在我們的對門，有一個船舶登記處設立的分處，凡民船經過，必須登記，但每逢登記一舟，必有一筆比國庫收入大一二倍的收入。登記者大多是目不識丁的農民，因此付出的一千五百至二千元，而證書牌上却明白的寫着祗有五百元。道麽一來這一千五百元左右的收入，不全是統統進了他們的腰包了嗎？</p>
<p>中國目前的農民已瀕破產，我們不應再使這般質樸的人受到法律以外的無形榨取，所以我敢將目覩的事實，向船政當局呼籲，趕速掃除這種害人的積弊。（崑山讀者瞿向寰上）</p>

<h3>當真要金條麼？</h3>
<p>編者：本市茂名路（慕爾鳴路）敝友家，廿六年春間，有蔡某租賃其樓下統間居住，並未收任何額外費用。八一三戰後以至今日，蔡某已因營五金業得手而富有，最近以赤金六條頂進麥根路世德里房屋。但對租賃敝友之房間，竟不依照正當合法手續退租，反要挾敝友出赤金一條半万可遷讓蔡，某已於六月五日遷往麥根路居住，却將該房間鎖閉，目掦言將堆積貨物。如此橫蠻，敝友實無法應付。敝友向任敎職，處境貧弱，現子女成羣，欲將該房收回自用，而對無理可喻之房客，應用何種有效方法收回自用，金條世界，這人太甚，欺人太甚，願政府有一公平處斷！（方行吾敬啓）</p>

<h3>回老家去（小說）</h3>
<p>— 游池沼</p>
<p>勝利後的第一個冬天，中午的警報嚮過了，大廈裏吐出人羣，黃浦灘吹來北風特別猛，刮痛人的面孔，張子良這時也剛從×股票公司走跳出來，他全身感到溫暖，得意洋洋的，他想着，想着那最興奮的一幕。</p>
<p>「猪豬！」一個穿着不整齊的陌生者和他撞了個滿懷，不由他惱得罵出來，連忙用手拍着那新製的黑絨大衣，向那人瞟了一眼。</p>
<p>那人看到他那種氣派，噤得只好向前走去，「老張，」另一個人給「豬豬」的響聲，所引起而向他打招呼，「呵，老王。」子良和那人握手，又向他上下打量了一下，「多時不見，你好？」老王也在注視着子良的全身。「馬馬，虎虎，吃過午飯嗎；和你細談去」，子良得意地說，他想向老友賣弄一下，還未待　　老王開口又尖着喉嚨喊：「三輪車」「三輪車」。</p>
<p>車夫熟練地快駛過來，他拉着老王上車，用手向前面一指：「精美餐室」。他說着又掏出兩支雪茄來，一支遞給老王，劃上了火「呃」！像歎了一口氣。</p>
<p>老王吸着雪茄，也像在思索着两人沉默了一會，</p>
<p>「哈囉！」兩個美國兵也坐着三輪車，呌車夫向前趕去，擦過他們的車旁，嬉戲地向他們打招呼。</p>
<p>「猪豬，頂好！」子良像佔了便宜地在反應着，哈哈哈笑出來，引得老王也莞爾了。</p>
<p>精美餐室到了，子良掏出一元美金擲給車夫，頭也不回，拉着老王向裏而走。</p>
<p>待者招待好了，請問他們吃什麼飯。</p>
<p>「請客，還吃你們的特快餐不成，隨便揀幾樣好小菜來，要快！」子良像怪侍者不懂事的，又瞟了他一眼。</p>
<p>「老張，剛才那裏來？」老王吸了口雪茄問。</p>
<p>「××股票公司，」子良的聲音像提得響些，一面把烟扔到小缸裏。</p>
<p>「你在那裏辦事？」</p>
<p>「不，到那裏玩玩。」</p>
<p>使得老王沉默起來，他想子良和他本在偽府同事，勝利後就解職了，本來都是窮職員，怎麼不見他兩個月就闊起來了，而且那裏來的本錢玩股票。</p>
<p>「那你在什麼地方辦事？」老王不由得追問一句。</p>
<p>「××部駐×辦事處，」子良仰着頭，噴了一口烟。</p>
<p>「那，你……」</p>
<p>「我在處裏是做外勤工作」子良像已懂得老王的問話截着他說：「我們做外勤的，早上到公事房簽了到，是隨時可以出差去，你知道，外勤要比坐在公事房的科長處長好得多，又自由，又……」子良說到最後一句在吞吐着，只向老王做一個鬼臉。</p>
<p>「你本領真好！」老王也會心地笑出來，又像羨慕着。</p>
<p>「怪不得你有餘暇餘錢，跑股票公司。」</p>
<p>「這個世界，什麼都得會鑽，不鑽怎會伸出頭來，我就靠了這門路才像個樣，」子良說着把手錶看了一下，又續着說：「老王，你到底找到了事做沒有？」</p>
<p>老王用苦笑表示了回答，子良也會心地笑出來了。</p>
<p>「我看，你老哥，就太老實，這種年頭，老實人會能混飯吃，」子良在感慨地說。</p>
<p>老王現出覥靦的樣子，只嘆一口氣。</p>
<p>飯後，他們分別了。張子良走到××部駐×辦事處，因為下午股票沒有交易，那天也沒有什麼公事。他和同事在撩天，談金，談股，談舞場，談女人，却絕口不談國事。</p>
<p>放工，張子良蹺着左脚銜着雪茄坐車回到家裏，他底妻子也正搓完了十二圈。</p>
<p>「今天，今天行情怎樣？」妻搶着問。</p>
<p>「不像你身上的曲綫，却是直綫上升。」子良噴了一口烟氣，笑出來，哈哈哈。「你呢，你的戰績怎樣？」</p>
<p>「撕你的嘴。」妻在扯起手來，左手上算盤子金戒和鑽戒在閃光，龍鳳鐲一幌幌地耀着眼。「要你賠償損失，今天就輸了近萬！」</p>
<p>「這算什麼，股票漲一元，就夠你輸一年了！」他乘勢摟着妻，外面儘還在刮着北風，而他們的室內是熱烘烘的。</p>
<p>晚上張子良在告訴妻，這兩天的股票行情人人都看好，而金價因中行拋售，所以沒有上落，他想把所有的金都換了股票，而且把妻的首飾也兌換去增厚實力</p>
<p>「你看今天就直漲了三成，明天再漲三成，後天……我的家當就過千萬，到時脫了手，就和你回老家去，省得低心下氣拍牛拍馬，看人臉色。」張子良對妻滔滔地下了個定論。</p>
<p>他妻子也想是對的，他更深信自己的丈夫正「鴻運當頭」「無往不利」。勝利後鑽到了那門路，靠東接西收，就弄來幾條金條，再鑽起念頭來買股票，一上手就「旗開得勝」，更體面起來了，要再來這麼一着，像霍亂菌在人身裏，一變二，二變四起來，回老家去就成了個首富，置田買地，呼奴，喝婢，一生玩吃不盡。想到這裏不由得也興奮起來，口涎直咽下肚子裏，四肢怪舒服的。</p>
<p>第二天張子良趕到辦事處簽了名，就辦出差，他兌了首飾，拋出金子就買進一萬多股××的股票，那是三個熱門的最熱門股</p>
<p>股票在上漲着，他注視着報告板，嘴裏狂吸着雪茄，站在電話機旁的職員提高喉嚨在報告行情，書寫的也迅速地寫在板上，「35，40……」子良在看着，聽着。面容滿意地笑，心裏也在跳動，問時哄哄歡笑的聲音，更使他覺得像得了同情的，他不時的向熟識的人點頭交換眼光作會心的微笑。他一看錶，還不過是十時多，要是這樣下去，到了十時收盤，豈不又要漲三成。</p>
<p>「45，50……」報告的在說，書記在寫。</p>
<p>「五千股，二千股，一千股……」交易的聲音在旋動。</p>
<p>「又漲，漲，漲，漲，今天又有描頭。」人們在議論着。</p>
<p>十一時了，電話像停頓起來，報告的書寫的才得了個休息的機會。人們就更大談起來。他們都是看好，明天更有描頭。</p>
<p>「行情那能，」司電話機的像耐不住沉寂向對方問。</p>
<p>「啊！不對，行情小下來，什麼原因？……」人們都在傾聽着。</p>
<p>「35，40……」子良的心也跟着聲浪跳動起來。</p>
<p>「30，35……」子良在狂吸着雪茄。</p>
<p>「呵，跌！」哄動了一下後，却沉寂下去了。</p>
<p>「25，30……」雪茄快吸完了，燃着他的手，子良才把它摔掉了，又重燃起一口吸着。</p>
<p>收盤了，子良回家吃午飯，妻問他，只搖着頭。</p>
<p>「你回家吃飯，我早就知描頭不對」，妻也寂然的說。</p>
<p>「開盤還是繼續漲上去，到十一時才變卦了，不知出了什麼事，我們小工頭，到底在暗裏，難道又來個大魚吃小魚」。子良担心地說。</p>
<p>「我就想，還是金子好，而且實用，股票到底是空的」妻像在懊悔着。</p>
<p>子良沒有回答，他們過了一個寂寞的下午和晚上。</p>
<p>第二天一早，子良就搶先翻開報紙來，他看到××局和××部的聯合通告，禁止股票買賣，心不由得投下一個陰影，像給石頭壓着一樣沉重。</p>
<p>他早點也不吃，走出門，冽凜的北風吹來，使他打了個寒噤，天也是陰沉的，像要下雨他走到×股票公司探消息。</p>
<p>「張先生，你看過報號？今天股票停止交易」！公司職員在告訴他，也搖着頭。</p>
<p>「唔」，子良全身炙熱起來，「有行情沒有」？他還像存着希望，可是語音有些顫動了。</p>
<p>「行情是黑黑市，在走廊裏喊的，但交易也難，在這樣空氣裏誰還買××的喊價也不過是「12，14。」</p>
<p>「什，什麼時候才復業呢。」子良額上冒着汗。</p>
<p>「天知道！」職員聳着肩搖着頭說。</p>
<p>張子良從××股票公司走出來，低頭在想，豈不是完了，全副財產都在那裏，要是沒有復業的日期，一切　就凍結起來。……他想着也不知自己究竟要走向那裏去。</p>
<p>「豬豬！」當他不自覺地走到馬路中，恰巧一駕無軌電車駛來，靠開車的趕快殺車才避了那危險，開車的不由怒罵一聲。</p>
<p>張子良怔住了，向開車的怒視一眼，當他正想走回人行道上，不料迎面又駛來一輛高速率六輪的「急暴車」。子良被輾倒在地上，在冷風裏人們在圍着看，張子良却已回老家去了！</p>

<p>長篇連載</p>
<h3>雙宿雙飛　九四</h3>
<p>— 趙清閣</p>
<p>這些，都不是麗華所能理解的！她純真地給予了董劭凌以特殊的感情；她在悄悄默戀着一個靈魂；她欲把這個靈魂佔為私有；但這些，又都是董劭凌所猜想不到；意識不到的。他們之間，有形無形，都有着很大的距離，這距離不是人力所能突破的，這距離使他們分歧在兩個不同的境界中；這距離，造成他們永恒的沒法彌補，沒法說明的遺憾！</p>
<p>這情形只有劉子雲看得明白，但她既不便戳穿他們彼此朦朧的情緒，也不願讓麗華的純真而又脆弱的心靈，更多一層憂傷！因為劉子雲對麗華的感情，是專一的，她幾乎是捐獻了整個的感情，願意犧牲了自己的一切，而為麗華的幸福，終生作一個忠實的保護人。換言之，劉子雲是一個非常機械而固執的數理專家；是一個必須把感情集中給予一個對象才滿足的！當她曾經把全部的感情交與了一個人，也可以說是寄託一個人；而這個人——（她的丈夫）却把她的全部感情又擲還了她的時候，她簡直痛苦得發了狂！為此，她發誓：她要再找一個「給予」的對象，這對象她希望是一個小孩，哪怕是條狗吧。她都情愿；但絕不能再給予一個男人；一個善變，多詐；喜新，厭舊的男人。所以，她不再結婚，她已獨身了五年，她視結婚如畏途！現在她的懸案解決了，她慶幸終於找到了一個可以無條件地給予她的感情全部的對象，這對象而且正需要着她的全部感情。於是，她快活了，她滿足地快活了！</p>
<p>開封也有着軍閥的余孽，因此北伐的烽火，波及了開封，因此麗華又得跟着　太太和張弦作第三次的流浪。流浪的碼頭目標是武漢，他們便準備着朝向這個新的目標地行進。</p>
<h3>仁愛</h3>
<p>— 謝北城</p>
<p>在一本很好的初小公民教科書裏，我讀到如下的幾句話：</p>
<p>「我愛護有益人類的動物。」</p>
<p>「我愛護本國的同胞。」</p>
<p>這兩句話的下面都有一個括弧，裏面註釋着「仁愛」兩個字，意思是解釋給孩子們「仁愛」的涵義，使他們能夠身體力行的做一個好公民。</p>
<p>對於編書的人我沒有意見，我早說過這是一本好書，但我想起另外的一件事來了。因為在這裏我發現「仁愛」原來也是有限度的，時代進步了，「仁愛」的範圍也漸漸縮小了。</p>
<p>佛講因果，是勸人解化冤仇；佛戒殺生，是說生命是可愛的，在釋迦的金蓮花下面，多的是毒蛇猛獸，在西天的世界裏，無你無我，這一種廣博的愛，便不僅是「有益人類的動物」而已。耶穌誥誡人：「要愛你的敵人」，我們生長在這個世界上，漸漸的學得乖了，我們彷彿在耘植憎恨，不但使他在自己的心中生根，還企圖把這憎恨遺傳給子孫，但是耶穌被釘在十字架上，他的眼望着那些法律賽人，希伯來人，稅吏，和那些假冒偽善的人說「父呵，赦免了他們的罪吧！」</p>
<p>佛的訓誡，耶穌的教義到後來終為人接受，并且傳統到現在都有一千餘年以上的歷史了，他們也講仁愛，但是和我們的不同，是不是歲月太折磨人呢？</p>
<p>我不知道坐在講台上的教師們怎樣解釋那兩句書，是不是把反面意思也解釋給孩子們聽呢？</p>
<p>「不愛無益於人的動物。」</p>
<p>「我不愛外國人！」</p>
<p>在現在正在講求世界聯合國的時代怕是不太適宜吧，我沉默在書齋裏，終於悟出了著書人的聰明，因為他在那外國人橫行的世界上生活過，這痛苦剛剛抹去不久，他住的地方還被人習慣的稱呼着租界，於是便：</p>
<p>「我愛本國的同胞！」</p>
<p>隱隱的含着非我族類的憎恨，我們說誰對呢？誰不對呢？再譬如說，一九四六年的現在，DDT殺蟲藥大流行，和尚是肉做的，怕蟲咬，於是禪堂上也噴DDT，同時他們還念誦着「我佛慈悲！」</p>
<p>更淺顯一點，這次世界上的戰爭耶穌的信徒不是也背負着槍桿上前綫了嗎？他們不僅沒有愛他們的敵人，　　那憎恨怕還是比別人更深吧！這樣愛是種在憎恨上了。</p>
<p>我倒不希望人談仁愛，却把愛種在憎恨上面：</p>
<p>「我恨有益人類的動物。」</p>
<p>「我恨本國的同胞。」</p>
<p>這種生活我們也並不是沒有經歷過，不是說還有細菌武器之類在發明嗎？</p>
<p>我衹希望，人類學得乖了，也更實際了，孩子是純潔的，我們莫欺騙他們呵！</p>
<h3>農家之女（世界名畫選載）</h3>
<p>— 奧哈森作國際知識和平會議　蘇代表讓步後　和會定期召開　本報編譯室特輯稿  南　　和平會議的召開，和平條約的簽訂，是戰爭的正式結束，所以誰都盼望它快些惠臨。　　由於第二次世界大戰範圍的龐大，問題的複雜，結束起來必須舉行三個和平會議，一個是對義，保，羅，匈，芬五國的和平會議，一個是對德和平會議，還有一個是對日和平會議。須俟三個和平會議都順利完成，和平條約都正式簽字之後，世界才會恢復本來面目，並且平添一番新氣象。　　預定於本月廿九日在巴黎舉行的廿一國和平會議，是專門討論對義，保，羅，匈，芬五國的和約，換句話說，就是三個和平會議的第一個。但是在決定召開這個和平會議之前，已經不知費了多少唇舌，一波三折，真是極盡屈曲幻變的能事。現在且把其中的經過情形，簡單地敘述一下。　　對義，保，羅，匈，芬五國和約的討論，始於一九四五年九月間在倫敦舉行的第一屆外長會議，但是爲了程序問題上發生困難而陷入僵局。當時，關於對義和約的若干方面曾獲協議，在對芬和約對羅保兩國和約的準備工作方面亦獲具體的進展。會議的主要障礙，就是和約的起草工作，是否應限於簽字於降書的國家爲謀打開這種僵持的局面，三強外長又於一九四五年十二月在莫斯科舉行會議。結果決定外長會議中惟有簽字於降書的會員團，才能參加起草對五國的和約。換言之，對義和約由英，美，蘇，法四國起草，對羅，保，匈和約由英，美，蘇三國起草，對芬和約由英蘇兩國起草。　　根據莫斯科外長會議的決定，四國外長在倫敦的代表則受命分別起草對五國的和約，一俟和約草案準備就緒，就將由外長會議的五個會員會以及聯合國中對於反抗歐洲敵國在軍事方面曾作實際貢獻的十六個國家，舉行和平大會，作最後的討論。曾有一個時候，和平大會是預定於今年五月一日舉行的。　　但是四國外長代表在起草和約的時候遭遇了許多困難，障礙重得，彷佛已經走入竊途末路的樣子，預定於五月一日召開的和會，其勢已不得不展期舉行了。就在這個緊張關頭，美國務卿貝爾納斯主張再在巴黎召開四國外長會議一次，問題的復雜和關係的重大，勞非四國外長親自出馬不可了。結果英，蘇，法三國都表示贊同，會議就在四月廿五日召開。在開會期間，四國外長曾就起草和約所遭遇的困難問題，逐一加以檢討。折衝的結果，一部份次要的問題是獲得協議了，但是主要的問題却懸而未決，各方僵持不下，尤其是特港及其腹地問題，義國殖民地問題和多腦河通航問題，意見最爲鑒枘，局勢幾乎到了不可挽回的程度，當時悲觀的氣氛，漲浸全球。　　四強外長在場內爭得面紅耳赤，但是出了場門，就是「好朋友」，親熱非常。　　黑暗之中　透露光明　　幸而在一片黑暗之中，突然透露了一綫光明，就是巴黎外長會議並不就此宣佈失敗，而決定展期，定於一個月後再行召開。算了這一點轉機，四國外長終於在六月十五日再度在巴黎聚首。　　從四國外長會議所面臨的問題來看，的確是錯綜復雜，各個國家爲了本身的益利，不得不鈎心鬥角，不甘退讓。但是世界究竟是一個飽經戰禍的世界，久亂思治，不僅是一般民眾的心理，同時也爲代表各國民眾的外長的願望。所以在這一次巴黎外長會議中，各方儘量尋取妥協的方案，終於對先前未解決的重要問題，獲得了折衷的解決辦法•例如義南國境劃定了妥協的界綫，而特港則由國際共管；義國殖民地則採取避重就輕的辦法，延至一年後再予以解決，祇要對義和約中聲明義國放棄殖民地的主張就可以了；多腦河通航一點，四國已承認爲世界和平及世界貿易的利益起見，有將多腦河及其可通航的支流和運河，在各國完全平等的條件下，予以自由開放的必要。他若義國賠償問題，義國殘餘艦隊處置問題以及撤退義國境內的英美軍隊和保加利亞境內的蘇聯軍隊問題等，都已經商定了辦法，所以準備和約草案，已經沒有多大的困難，期待已久的廿一國和平會議，終於決定在七月廿九日隆重開幕了。　　邀請問題　蘇聯讓步　　但在決定召開和會發出請柬之前，還經過相當的波折：其一是邀請國問題，另一是和會程序問題•蘇外長莫洛托夫堅主中　不應爲和會邀請國之一，僅能爲被邀請國。美國務卿員爾納斯當塲予以嚴斥，認爲這是完全錯誤而不必要的舉動，等於侮辱中國。我國王外長也提出嚴正的聲明，認爲此舉問屬違背莫斯科協定。最後，蘇聯在各國與論壓力之下，放棄問　的態度，接受和會主席由中，英，美，蘇，法五國外長輪流担任，而和會則由外長會議全體名義召開的辦法。至於程序的問題，也發生過一番爭執。莫洛托夫堅主和會程序應由四強決定，隨請柬發出，但是英外相具文和美國務卿貝爾納斯則堅決表示和會程序問題應由廿一國全體大會作最後的決定。最後還是採用折衷辦法，由外長會議決定原則數條，以建議方式分致與會各國，供其採納。　　經過了上面這許多波折，廿一國和平會議終於決定在本月廿九日在巴黎召開，全世界愛好和平的人士，可以拭目以待了。　　在和會開幕之前，愛好和平的人士當然希望它工作進行順利，收穫美滿的果實，進而使對德日的和會也可以早日召開，使世界迅速恢復本來面目，向戰後和平繁榮之途邁進。世界珍聞　　巴黎因爲屋荒，政府當局頃規定，每人所住不得超過臥室一間，客廳一間，餐室一間，廚房在外。一家數口者依此比例類推。——「餘屋必須出租！」　　世界上最難造的一段鐵路，要算秘魯中央鐵道的某段了。這段鐵道全長不過一百三十八哩，但造了十二年才造成，該路從海平而處開始，蜿蜒曲折爬過拔海一萬五千呎的高原，全程計造隧道六十五座，橋樑六十七座。由於工程之艱難，造路工人一萬三千名中，失事致死者一萬一千名。　　世界上最摩登的衣料，紅光照上去就變紅，綠光照上去就變綠，藍光照上去就變成一片蔚藍。這是由玻璃質（可塑體）纖維成的，由於輻射面的曲折不同，而能變成各種各樣的顏色。這種衣料還有一個頂大的好處：用不到洗，只要拿塊濕毛巾一揩，就又乾淨了。　　主婦們時常覺得頭痛，火柴一不小心放在比較潮濕的地方，不久就擦不燃了。但現在，這已經不要緊了。一種防水的火柴，已在市上出售。這種火柴，係先在六種膠質溶液中浸過，乾後，就塗着一層極薄的透明膠膜了。這種火柴，你把它浸在水裏廿四小時，撈起來還是一樣可以用。神秘的匈牙利　百萬元鈔票用來點香煙　議員年俸祇夠買一斤糖  默　　在一個美國兵看來，匈京布達佩期真是個莫名其妙的地方。豪華一世的旅館裏，呌一瓶頂好的香檳，也不過四角五分美金。在伐西街的大公司裏，只要幾張零碎找頭的鈔票，就可以買到絲襪，象牙或者名貴的瓷器。一個上士的可憐薪俸就已能買到一座寫字間或者公寓的房契。但在一個匈牙利人自己看起來，這個地方也真是同樣的莫名其妙。一個國會議員年俸六十五萬本哥（匈幣），剛够買一斤糖。一幛兩樓兩底的公寓，月租限價二萬本哥，房東拿來剛夠坐一次電車。　　上禮拜，原已飛昇到了嚇人的天文數字的本哥，還在不停地向上漲。在一九三九年，一本哥值美金二九•一二分。上個月，一塊美金還只不過合一，〇〇〇，〇〇〇，〇〇〇，〇〇〇本哥，到七月三日已漲到了合八〇〇，〇〇〇，〇〇〇，〇〇〇，〇〇〇，〇〇〇本哥了。上個月，匈牙利人還在嘴上說着「百萬本哥票」，「千萬本哥票」，上禮拜已只能說「萬萬本哥票」了，到如今，說也已無法說，只好用「棕票」（即一〇〇，〇〇〇，〇〇〇，〇〇〇，〇〇〇本哥票）和藍票（即一，一〇〇，〇〇〇，〇〇〇，〇〇〇，〇〇〇本哥票）來代表了。這情形比一九二三年時德國的馬克還要糟到一千倍，匈牙利政府的物價統制政策早已經完全垮台了　　政府的政策原只不過希望各日用必需品在一天內能穩定不變。工資都是每天每天算的。但不幸得很，物價却是一小時一小時地漲。情形已完全絕望，因爲外援旣無希望，而匈牙利自己浦經戰亂，也沒有什麼穩定經濟的辦法。現在，布達佩斯的馬路上，一張百萬本哥的鈔票掉在地上是決無人會彎腰拾的了，因爲一張百萬本哥鈔票的用處，恐怕只不過是能點一支香煙吧。一百萬元的鈔票用來點香烟，豪哉匈牙利人中国自嘆勿如。</p>

<p>自由談請郵局注意  少夫　　今天，不惜篇幅發表下面這封長信者，第一，我們一向贊譽郵政局的人事制度，希望能因此引起當局的注意，澈查道件事，因爲我們決不將它看作是張佑榮先生個人的問題；第二，用人惟賢惟能，信賞必罰，一秉至公，勿以所好好之，勿以所惡惡之，升遷黜退，生老病死，須有法度，一個機構，一個事業，能如此，這個機構必健全，這個事業必發達，吾則，將助長社會的混亂，私慾橫流，常前人心不古者，不能說這沒有關係。　　自由談是讀者的園地，芝蔴大的小事，祗要是成爲一個社會問題，我們決不漠視而輕易放過的；不過爲了適合各種趣味起見，也並不打算專門用這個方式來討論問題，來發表所有的來信。　　以下是張佑榮先生的原函：　　晨讀貴刋：「一封來信」是中央銀行業務局四位先生對當局不合理的調派而作呼籲，　　先生雖非常同情，惟信中缺乏具體事實，故未便刋出，　　先生再說：「一個機關或一個團體的用人行政自有它的規章，倘使必要，而且合理合法有權作任何處置」先生！你的話是很對，下面一段事實以作四位先生呼籲的回聲。　　亡兒服務蕪湖一等郵局爲郵務佐之職，今年廿六歲，在廿歲時考入郵局，奉命派往蕪湖，淪陷區郵負生活之艱苦與後方公務員我不敢相比，終算挨過了漫長五餘年，在去年九月十七日請事假返滬，旋得病留滬，即向上海管理局人事組呈請病假，先後二次每次二十天，迭經局醫證明及帮辦核准在案，初次呈准似期爲三十四年十月十一日起，二十天，後經無湖郵局來函，因事假病假之分更正爲卅四年十月七日起，績假爲三十四年十月廿七日起，二次共四十天，我兒因照郵規尙餘事假四天，故在十一月廿日往蕪湖銷假，豈知到第四日局長遞示安徽管理局令：「已於十月十二日起作因病休致辦理。」　　我兒服務蕪湖郵局已逾五餘年，對於其往日病假當少詳細記錄，初次滬局核給病假憑據在十月十六日寄往蕪湖，後經其來函更正日期，後又接到蕪湖郵局十月二十四日所發之訓令：「應另覓具無限保證書」·當遵即覓具，將證書寄往蕪湖，續假憑據，在十月三十日寄往，此後蕪湖郵局也未給任何覆示或訓令，照此我兒所請病假當核准無疑，因忠於職務，故不多作調養，趕往蕪湖報到，豈知安徽管理局早日已將其作因病休致辦理。　　因病休致事關他人無業有業之辦理，郵局若作期前或届期通知，則我兒是決不離滬前往，而郵局竟在過期後四十餘天復命令，其影響病後之吾兒，實不忍復憶。　　該時我兒自間身體尙好，况無湖郵局亟需人手，故即呈請安徽管理局准於在原局復職，豈知復職直到今年三月間方准，且將其調往合肥郵局，並領到旅費五萬元。　　病後的我兒經四月餘失業的刺激，身體實不堪支持，在三月二十四日投入蕪湖弋矾山醫院，希望早日復原前往合肥復職，其忠於職務之表示，憶及如歷歷在目，在四月四日蕪湖郵局訓令：在四月十五日以前，必須前往合肥復職，又在四月十一日以同樣訓令嚴促其啓程，並責其滯蕪，如逾期即不准復職，故然在四月十六日病入危境，終於在四月廿一日病逝該院。　　能復職而不給其復職，不能復職硬要其復職，此即先生所謂：「有權作任何處置」在六月廿七日曾將以上事實呈報上海管理局，後接其七月二日批示：「該事歸安徽管理局，管轄已轉該局咨請澈查何人濫使職權，逕覆，」直至今日尙未見任何覆示。　　我兒死後已逾三月，也未見郵局任何通知，及將保單退回及任何撫恤，其視吾兒職業，生命竟同兒戲，郵局是人事制度完善機關，一定我兒人情尙未完備，而得到其結果。　　四位先生，以上事實作你的答覆，你們以爲如何？　　張佑榮謹上　三五，七，二二。抗議  陳琳　　十九日自由談上有一篇「南京吉普，禁載女郎」，閱之，不勝遺憾！　　難道女人連坐吉普車的資格都沒有嗎？據該文的作者說：「因爲有了女人，汽油要多用些，車輪下要多幾個輾死的枉死鬼。」事實上或者是如此，但是就這緣故，便能稱女子爲「禍水」了嗎？照這樣說來，男子又何嘗不是「鍋水」呢？因男司機駕車而被輾死的人，實在不計其數呢！再說閒人坐着吉普車兜風的，豈僅女人，大多數還是男人，爲什麽所有的女人都不准坐吉普，而軍事機關的眷屬，司機的朋友，祇要是男性，便可以自由的在街上兜着風，這難道是節省汽油？　　我認爲這是侮辱女子的。希望陳總長立即收回成命，要是眞的節省汽汕，就該禁止一切開人乘坐吉普車，一致的要求重征  熏征　　道兩天「自由談」上，迎續不斷的談着交通問題。這些意見，誠如少夫先生所說：「就是它代表了巿民們的一般意見」　　上海的電車秩序為什麽這樣壞呢？這裏僅我親眼所見寫在下面：　　一般的情形，都不大好，除了靜安寺與外灘是排隊外，其他各小站根本一團糟，電車一來蜂湧而上，爭先恐後，結果上的人上不去，下的人下不來，大家叫苦連天。有時候連外灘也會破例的不排隊，向車上亂擠。　　還有，隊伍原來排得很好，而一些特殊階級者，突然從隊伍當中衝出來迎頭趕上。假使時間急迫，他們更會從窗子裏爬進去，等了好久的乘客們反而向隅。　　在電車上，這些特殊之流，唯一的本領是不打票，售票員連問也不敢問，如果萬一問他們一聲，他們會　出鐵面孔甚至於大發雷霆，惱羞成怒地動全武行。　　其次，電車到站不停是常事，相反的電車不到站就停也是常事。但是特殊階級的人們要登車時，不管在什麽地方手一揮，只要司機看到了，便會馬上停車請他們上來。上海交通正處於極困難的時期，尤其是電車，車子少，乘客多，再加上不守秩序，怎弄得好？　　我希望無論是什麼人，應該知道：生存於今日，如不知秩序爲何物，該是一種恥辱！這是全上海三百七十萬市民一致的要求「陞官發財勿走別路，行私營賄試入此門！」　吳垣二三事  白廉　　蘇州敵偽產業處理局的門首掛有：「陞官發財請走別路，行私營賄莫入此門」的對聯；但越是寫得如此動人，而行事却越是不可聞問。該局的兪黄兩股長，因賄逼死女子常東娥的案子，一直延遲到今天還未了結。法院已公佈將於月內公開審訊，蘇州人對之異常重視。祗怕審來審去，審得毫無結果。有人戲將該聯改爲：「陞官發財勿走別路，行私營賄試入此門」！未免極盡笑駡之能事了！　　最近蘇州嚴格禁止地下錢莊。地下錢莊者，秘密將現鈔拆進拆出作高利貸盤剝的印子錢店也。這些地下錢莊的利息，高得着實怕人；最大者竟有每月四角八分之巨。地下錢莊結算利息或五日一結，或十日一結，普通大都爲十日一結。個中人稱「分」爲兩，如十兩即爲一角。警局曾將蘇州所有地下錢莊負責人傳詢具結，但結果仍在暗中交易。　　被傳詢嚴禁的地下錢莊，數目有七百家之多，實足令人咋舌。在被傳詢之後，有些負責人均屬商界中人，唯恐被新聞記者拿了去當新聞登出來，於自已的面子上不大好看。遂聯合幾家要面子的負責人，合併了一千萬元分配給蘇地大小各報，並且還定有條例是：大報二百萬元，小報一百萬元，報之大小，視報紙是對開抑八開爲別。結果不肯出賣報格的報紙，都高風亮節，爲新聞事業爭一口氣！也是小事  奇之　　在從前，因有公共租界與法租界之分，故電車雖有着相同的路數，而走着不相同的路，也無甚大碍。　　現在租界已收回，上海市已完全統一，而那些舊兩租界中，同路數的電車仍舊存在，眞是不便。　　居民們旣不能稱之爲××租界的幾路，也不便說爲舊英，法祖界的幾路，更不能以一區八區來辨別，眞是大傷腦筋！　　對於路數的更改，最好能有一個辦法！</p>
<h3>憶念兩位外交家</h3>
<p>— 平齊</p>
<p>上屋期六，上海文化界在國際飯店舉行茶會，歡迎倦遊歸來的胡適之先生，在茶會上胡先生和顏駿老都發表了詞令極美麗的演說，筆者茶逢其盛，實在榮幸。但是，我倒同時也想起了十年之前，淸華大學的一次校慶大會，因爲，在那一次開會的時候，被邀講演的，也正就是上星期六演講的兩位——顏先生和胡先生。而且，那一天跟上星期六的茶會一樣，也是顏先生穿洋裝，胡先生穿大掛。這十年來的世事滄桑，正不知經過了多少變化！現在重新又聽到了這兩位先生演講，實在令人太感動了！</p>
<p>記得十年前顏先生的那篇演詞裏，他提起了當年騎着小驢出西直門到淸華園辦公的故事。那時顏先生是「淸華學堂」的「督辦」，換句話說，也就是現在淸華大學校長的職位。胡適之先生考淸華留美，也就是在顏先生負責校務的時候。</p>
<p>所以，如果掉一句舊文的話，顏先生實在是胡先生的「座師」。顏先生在上星期六茶會上說的，「適之先生到淸華來考出洋的時候，我正好也和清華有一點關係」。雖然極外交詞令婉轉之能事，而他的意思，恐怕實在就是指的這一層關係。</p>
<p>我在淸華時爲了好奇，曾查過當年考出洋的卷，胡先生出洋的那一年，第一名錄取的是趙元任先生，成績好到無可再好，總平均在九十五分左右。胡先生似乎不甚得意，因爲那一年好像一共出去了六位，而胡先生好像就考的是第六名，好像分數也沒有滿六十分——不知怎樣的忽然叫我想起了另外一位大使顧少川了。</p>
<p>胡先生的道德文章，我是不勝欽佩之至的，但是我最佩服他的一點却是他的風趣，有幽默感，所以，我深深相信，萬一他也翻翻「自由談」，看到了這篇小文之後，他大槪未必會生氣的·</p>

<h3>Yangtai Highway Fully Opened; National Army Meets at Guangfu Bridge; Zhu De's General Headquarters Moves to Shuyang</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Jiangdu, 23rd] The Yangtai Highway was completely opened up by the National Army this evening. The National Army launched a counterattack simultaneously from the Yangtai front this morning. The western route captured Baituo River and continued eastward, meeting the National Army advancing westward near Guangfu Bridge in the evening. Consequently, the Communist forces disrupting the Yangtai Highway have been completely driven away. According to reports, the Yangtai Highway was damaged by the Communist forces from midnight on the 13th of this month until the 18th, when the National Army repaired the road. However, it was damaged again on the same evening and has remained so until today.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Jiangdu, 23rd] At 2:00 PM today, the National Army recovered Baituo River on the Yangtai Highway and advanced towards Guangfu Bridge.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Zhenjiang, 23rd] According to a telephone call from Yangzhou, at approximately 9:00 AM yesterday, over a thousand Communist soldiers attacked Fanjiatao, northeast of Xiannvmiao, but were bravely repelled by the National Army. Another group of approximately several hundred soldiers sneaked to Gaojiawu on the west bank of the Taiping Township River, north of Wanfu Bridge, attempting to threaten Wantou Town. The National Army is maintaining strict defenses. Military sources also indicate that the Communist forces are actively attacking Donghai, and Zhu De has moved his general headquarters from Huaiyin to Shuyang to oversee the command.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Lujiang, 23rd] According to military sources, the Communist forces have retreated in three routes after abandoning Majiaji and Zhuzhenji north of Luhe County: (1) retreating from Majiaji towards the Han Jian Zhang Gongpu area of Xuyi; (2) retreating from Zhuzhenji towards Xinglongji of Xuyi; (3) retreating from Sihedun, Yezhan, towards the border of Tianchang County. A portion of the Communist 3rd Division under Huang Kecheng, approximately five thousand strong, still occupies the Erhongshan area in the southeast of Tianchang County. Another unit, the Ganquan Detachment, totaling over three thousand, has also sneaked to the Shajiaji and Dingji area northeast of Luhe County and within the territory of Yizheng County. Another unit of approximately one thousand soldiers has sneaked from Tianchang to the Yujiaji and Zhongjiaji area northeast of Babaiqiao, intending to attack Yizheng and strengthen the encirclement of Yangzhou.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Zhenjiang, 23rd] The North Jiangsu Communist forces' ambitions are not yet extinguished. In recent days, they have forcibly conscripted over five thousand laborers in various strongholds between Gaoyou and Shaobo, building communication trenches, small bunkers, and underground rooms. Taking Zhaoguan Dam as a stronghold, they have also blocked the Maqiaoan River mouth, a necessary passage from the lower reaches of Gaoyou Lake to Shaobo Lake, by planting wooden stakes in the water. Near Ganquan Mountain within Jiangdu County on both banks of Shaobo Lake, over five thousand Communist soldiers suddenly arrived on the 21st, equipped with over thirty light and heavy machine guns and five cannons, their intentions unclear.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 23rd] The National Army guarding the northwest positions of Baipu Town on the Nantong front inflicted heavy damage on the attacking Communist forces. Although they continued to face constant attacks on the 22nd, all were repelled. The National Army east of Huangqiao Town repelled the Communist attack on Diaoqiao and took advantage of the situation to advance to the area east of Fenjie Town. The Communist forces reinforced from Rugao to continue the attack, but have been stopped, and fierce fighting is currently taking place near Hejiaba.</p>
<p>Communist Guerrillas in Chengxi Township Cross Railway and Flee to Wujin</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Jiangyin, 23rd] A small group of Communist guerrillas in Qiuzhuang, Chengxi Township, crossed the railway to the southwest towards Wujin County at midnight on the 22nd. Small squads of Communist soldiers have been discovered in the small towns along the Yangtze River in Shazhou and in Zhangjiagang outside the eastern part of the county.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Jiangyin, 23rd] The Communist governments of Jingjiang, Chengdong, Chengxi, and Taixing counties, along with the two independent Jingtai regiments, are all hiding in the Zhengdongwei area of the Seventh District of Jingjiang, waiting for an opportunity to stir up trouble. The group fleeing into Chengxi Township is the unit of Yu Naizhang, leader of the Chengxi Special Operations Team, who have lingered and not left, with other intentions.</p>
<h3>When the National Army Recaptured Taixing, They Seized a Communist Secret Order; Conspiracy to Launch a Full-Scale Internal Rebellion is Clearly Revealed</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Taixing, 23rd] When the National Army successively recaptured Taixing City and the towns occupied by the Communist forces on the 16th, they seized a Communist secret order, a directive to the entire 6th Division to seize Taixing. The document was issued on July 11th, signed and sealed by Tan Zhenlin, Wang Bicheng, Jiang Weiqing, Li Ganhui, and Zhang Chuangchu. The original text reads in brief: "Now the orders from the higher authorities have been issued, giving us the glorious mission of annihilating the enemy and taking Taixing City. We are about to enter the battle, and the gunfire is about to sound. This battle is of great significance to Central China and the entire country. We must achieve complete victory. This battle is the largest since the establishment of our division, and also for the 16th Brigade. We must fight to our heart's content and fight beautifully. In this battle, the 1st Division and the 7th Column, and other corps, will fight alongside us. We must coordinate with them to strive for victory in the entire campaign. At the same time, we must learn from them and compete with them in the revolution to see who can complete the combat mission 100%, who can correctly implement the confiscation policy and the prisoner-of-war policy, and who can capture the most prisoners and seize the most guns, cannons, and bullets. Comrades of the 16th Brigade, you must resolutely complete the mission, fight tenaciously, overcome all difficulties, and take Taixing. Comrades of the 16th Brigade, you have many experiences in counter-offensive battles, and you have established thousands of glorious achievements. You must carry forward your tradition of being brave and good at fighting, fight resolutely, complete the mission, annihilate the enemy, support the reinforcements, protect our brotherly units, take Taixing City, and strive for an even greater victory after the Yaojiadai battle. Comrades, our prestige has spread throughout the north and south of the Yangtze River. We are a magnificent division that has experienced hundreds of battles, is invincible in attack, and victorious in every battle. We are the people's army under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party. Your bullets are loaded, your bayonets are sharpened, your cannons are aimed at the enemy, fight with unparalleled tenacity, and completely and thoroughly eliminate the enemy, annihilate the enemy's reinforcements, and take Taixing City. The glorious titles of combat hero, combat model, and work model await you." This document proves that the Communist forces are not only seizing Taixing and attacking North Jiangsu, but are also launching the beginning of a full-scale national rebellion. It is now reported that the National Army has sent a memorandum to the Nantong Group regarding the losses suffered in the attacked areas due to their trampling, lodging a solemn protest.</p>
<h3>Tang Enbo Arrives in Nanjing; Bai Chongxi and Chen Cheng Did Not Go to Northern Jiangsu</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 23rd] General Tang Enbo, Commander-in-Chief of the Army, arrived in Nanjing from Wuxi this afternoon. Reporters visited him, and it was learned that Tang will still depart to inspect within the next few days.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Nanjing, 22nd] Rumors that General Bai Chongxi, Minister of National Defense, and General Chen Cheng, Chief of the General Staff, had left Nanjing to inspect Northern Jiangsu have been denied by the spokesperson of the Ministry of National Defense. They stated that both General Bai and General Chen have not left Nanjing, and will not be leaving Nanjing in the near future.</p>
<h3>The Li-Wen Case Has Been Solved; Full Details to be Released in the Coming Days</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Kunming, 22nd] The Yunnan Garrison Headquarters has solved the case of the assassination of Li Gongpu and Wen Yiduo. The case is complex and involves many people. A certain lieutenant general has been arrested, and a certain "公子" (son of a high official) surnamed Wen has fled into the mountains. Full details of the case will be released in the coming days.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Guling, 23rd] Chairman Lu Han of Yunnan arrived in Guling by plane from Nanjing this afternoon. Speaking to reporters, he stated that he was not in the province during the unfortunate assassinations of Li and Wen in Kunming, and he felt very sorry that the local security authorities could not prevent the conspiracy from happening in advance. When asked about his mission to the Northeast this time, Chairman Lu replied that he was going to the Northeast for sightseeing and had no specific mission.

<h3>The Executive Group Notifies Li Xiannian to Send Representatives to Discuss Ceasefire Measures; Intends to Make the Greatest Effort for Peaceful Mediation</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Hankou, 23rd] After arriving in Laohekou on the 14th, the 9th and 32nd groups of the Military Mediation Department made the greatest effort possible to seek peace. As of the 21st, the two groups had sent four letters to Li Xiannian, hoping that he would send representatives or come in person to an agreed location to discuss peaceful ceasefire measures. Each letter stated that the government representatives would agree to a 24-hour ceasefire after the Communist representatives arrived in order to discuss peace issues and make contact with the group. All of the aforementioned letters were signed by representatives of all three parties and sent by plane to the Communist area. It was determined that the Communist forces had received them, but as of the 21st, there was still no response. Therefore, the fourth letter issued by the group on the 21st was worded even more earnestly, stating, "This is the last attempt for peace. If we are still unable to contact your commander's representatives by the 24th, the 9th and 32nd groups will go to Xi'an on the 25th and then to Beiping three days later to request instructions." Now that this letter has been sent for two days, the Communist forces' response is still uncertain. It is generally hoped that the Communist forces will turn back and not betray the government's repeated leniency and the executive group's sincere efforts to mediate.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xi'an, 22nd] Reliable sources in the transportation sector report that the 32nd Executive Group arrived in Longjuzhai on the 21st, intending to make a final effort to stop the Communist forces under Li Xiannian from fleeing west.

It is also understood that the group has begun its work and has sent a telegram to Li Xiannian, hoping to arrive in Longjuzhai on the 24th for talks.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xi'an, 23rd] After arriving in Longjuzhai, the 32nd Executive Group immediately sent an invitation to Li Xiannian to go to Longjuzhai at 12:00 AM on the 24th for talks. The group also scheduled to depart for Xi'an on the 26th and then fly to Beiping.</p>

<h3>Chairman in Lushan</h3>
<p>— Our Correspondent in Kuling, Fang Canglang</p>
<p>Lushan, located in northern Jiangxi, encompasses seven major ridges and extends over five hundred li, is a renowned summer resort in Asia, China's summer capital, a cradle of the War of Resistance, and a cornerstone of national reconstruction. In terms of grandeur, its magnificence is beyond description; as for scenery, even a single rock or isolated peak is imbued with mist and clouds. The Ming Dynasty poet Wan Yi, in his poem about Lushan, wrote: "Auspicious clouds hover, thirty thousand feet high; excellent air descends, for two hundred years." Its atmosphere and scenery are such that they truly stir the heart and soul, inspiring a sense of transcendence. Therefore, our highest leader, Chairman Chiang, for several years before the War of Resistance, would take advantage of the summer vacation period each year to visit this mountain for a brief respite. As everyone knows, the summer climate of Lushan averages only seventy-five degrees. The climate is so cool and the scenery is exceptionally beautiful. For those who have lived in Nanjing for a long time, enduring the scorching sun and oppressive heat, ascending this mountain not only dispels the heat and eliminates worldly thoughts but also invigorates the spirit and enhances the interest in work due to the refreshing climate. Consequently, one cannot help but pursue work, strive in work, and become uplifted. Therefore, Chairman Chiang always seeks to encourage many young people to take advantage of the summer vacation to study in Lushan during the summer. After climbing the mountain, the Chairman not only enjoys robust health and a great appetite, but also, due to his abundant physical strength, his steps become more energetic. He often goes on unannounced excursions, alone with his cane and shoes, or strolls along the Flower Path, visiting the Immortal Ascension Platform of the White Deer Grotto; or explores the scenic cliffs, picnicking at the Imperial Stele Pavilion; or observes the waterfall at Stone Gate, gazing at the dense thickets, watching the raging waves and turbulent currents, flying up and falling down, and meditating deeply. Or he looks west towards Taiyi Peak, takes a car to Hanyukou, watches the sunset and moonrise, the dispersing clouds and vanishing mist, and nods with a smile. However, the Chairman's love for Lushan goes beyond this. People can perceive from the Chairman's words and actions that he deeply appreciates the dignified and pure atmosphere imbued by the spirit of Lushan. No one will forget that the grand strategy for China's War of Resistance was decided in Lushan nine years ago today. Everyone can imagine that the grand plan for China's national reconstruction may be decided today, tomorrow, the day after tomorrow, or in the near future, revisiting the lesson of nine years ago. Especially when General Marshall and Ambassador Stuart came to the mountain, people seemed to anticipate that after Ambassador Stuart presented his credentials, the situation might become clearer. Ambassador Stuart, still maintaining the demeanor of a scholar, also told reporters at 7:15 PM on the 19th, "The Chinese people are too miserable. Chairman Chiang is well aware of the suffering of the people and will issue a statement in the next two or three days. It is something that must be said and done. However, in the current situation, it may have to wait a few more days." However, our Chairman, who toils day and night, has his heart in the nation while residing in Lushan, never forgetting the suffering of the people. This great benevolence and magnanimity has moved both humans and gods and is truly inspiring. Specifically, at a time when the Chinese Communist Party is stirring up war in Jinan, Jinbei, western Henan, northern Hubei, Jiaodong, and northern Jiangsu, wantonly harming the people, the Chairman still hopes that the Communist Party will awaken with a great spirit of benevolence and still advocates resolving this troublesome issue of the Chinese Communist Party through political means. It is said that when the Chairman discussed this issue with General Marshall and Ambassador Stuart twice, expressing this compassionate attitude, both General Marshall and Ambassador Stuart were moved. After Ambassador Stuart took his leave, when speaking to others, he praised the Chairman's greatness and benevolence, hailing him as the "Savior of Mankind." Ambassador Stuart has been running schools in China for decades and has a deep understanding of Chinese history. He could see some signs of rise and fall in books about the Yellow Turban Rebellion of the Han Dynasty. When the White Wolf Rebellion of the early Republic occurred, he had already arrived in China. Now, this Ambassador Stuart, who deeply understands China's national conditions, has returned to Nanjing. General Marshall has also descended the mountain on the 22nd and flown back to Nanjing. Yesterday (the 21st), Chairman Chiang and his wife accompanied General and Mrs. Marshall on a tour of the Immortal Cave. After General Marshall returns to Beijing, the somber atmosphere of Nanjing may become more lively. However, the general view among the people in Lushan is twofold: Some say that if the CCP continues to insist on military separation and refuses to withdraw from northern Jiangsu and Jiaodong, this deadlock will not be broken. At that time, Ambassador Stuart will have to stay in Beijing to take care of his beloved Yenching University. It is also possible that General Marshall will have to return to Washington for a trip. Some say that if the CCP can awaken in a timely manner, change its basic attitude, abandon the delusion of force, and sincerely discuss all outstanding issues with the government, especially to stop the offensive in northern Jiangsu, negotiations can be reopened, and peace will not be hopeless. Now it seems to have reached a "final juncture." This is what the reporter heard on the mountain. In addition, Chairman Chiang's mountain life is also worth introducing: It is said that after climbing the mountain, the Chairman gets up no later than 6:30 AM every day, still washes his face with cold water, and after washing up, does more than ten minutes of exercise. After 7:00 AM, he reads the Bible. After 8:00 AM, he reads the morning newspaper (after the Lushan edition of the Central Daily News was published, there is a newspaper to read on the mountain every morning). After reading the newspaper, he sometimes reads important documents, and when he has time, he reads books, reading beneficial books. He usually eats breakfast before 10:00 AM. In the afternoon, he spends most of his time reading important reports, and when he has free time, he reads books, reading beneficial books.</p>

For example, Longshan, Wujiang, [illegible], Songjiang, and other places are [illegible], and the areas are narrow. Each county does not have a local court, and civil and criminal litigation cases are handled by the military law office separately established by the county government of each place, and the sentencing is often inappropriate.

The violent tax collection part includes: forced collection of plowing cattle and greedy grain import and export taxes, forced collection of business license tax, etc. The part of using power to blackmail includes: unauthorized collection of black fees, using treacherous and fake goods to lend high interest, and framing good people and defrauding them for release, etc. Now, Chen has accepted the complaint and secretly summoned witnesses at night. According to the various charges, most of them have been confirmed, and he is preparing to report and formally impeach him.</p>
<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Impartial Discussion on the Collection of Land Tax in Kind</h3>
<p>Since the central government decided to continue collecting land tax in kind for another year, it is heard that local councils and people's organizations have expressed considerable opposition, requesting exemption from the collection in kind. Some believe that the government's policy of collecting in kind yields few benefits to the government while causing much disturbance to the people, which seems contrary to the government's original intention. Others believe that the government is not planning to stabilize the currency or suppress prices, yet it is unwilling to abandon the collection of land tax in kind, which will only lead to the further exhaustion of the national economy. All of the above may contain some truth and deserves the government's attention. Now, with the autumn harvest in sight, the land tax is about to be collected, and the central government has already made a decision to continue collecting in kind for another year. Considering the people's hardships and the government's painstaking efforts, we feel it is necessary to offer our opinion on this matter.</p>
<p>From a fundamental perspective, the collection of land tax, as practiced traditionally, differs greatly from modern tax concepts and is not entirely in line with the Three Principles of the People's land policy. Therefore, ultimately, the traditional land tax system should be abolished and replaced with a land tax that is consistent with our land policy. However, because land reorganization takes time, the collection of land tax has to be temporarily retained as an expedient measure during the transition period. This is the first point that must be recognized. Since it is an expedient measure, the government, during the war, had to secure physical goods to supply military and public grain, and thus made the decision to change the land tax to collection in kind. The implementation of this decision, though not without malpractices in execution and occasional harassment of the people, ensured the uninterrupted supply of military and public grain from the national perspective, making a significant contribution to the prosecution and victory of the protracted war. Now that victory has arrived, it may seem unnecessary to continue collecting in kind on the surface, but the reality is that the situation remains unstable, domestic transportation has not yet been fully restored, and the difficulties of the national economy have not eased. The government's decision to continue collecting land tax in kind for another year is a matter of necessity. We know that the government must take responsibility for national affairs, and any decision is made only after careful consideration. We should first understand the painstaking efforts behind the government's decision, and then work to reduce the malpractices that may arise from the collection in kind.</p>
<p>We should also point out that the decision to continue collecting land tax in kind for another year is a relatively wise decision from an economic perspective. The increased issuance of currency to cope with the war has already caused drastic fluctuations in prices and the general economic life. Our runaway inflation has not yet reached the frightening state of Hungary, but in the current situation, our runaway inflation has caused hardship for both the government and the people. The government's top priority now is to avoid further expanding the issuance of currency as much as possible, which would exacerbate the economic crisis. However, the current situation prevents the government from thoroughly reorganizing the currency. If the issuance of currency were to be expanded again without limitation at this juncture, the collapse of the national economy would be beyond salvation. Extending the collection of land tax in kind for another year implies that the government will not have to expand the issuance of currency due to the grain issue. If the government were to stop collecting land tax in kind, the supply of military and public grain would inevitably have to be purchased from the people with cash. To purchase military and public grain, several hundred billion legal tender would have to be added to the market. As a result, the people would directly suffer. Collecting land tax in kind can reduce the issuance of currency and further reduce speculation in the market. From an economic point of view, the collection of land tax in kind is still a necessary policy at this time.</p>
<p>Therefore, at this time, we should not simply oppose the continuation of collecting land tax in kind for another year in principle. But this does not mean that we must also continue to retain the various malpractices in execution that come with the collection of land tax in kind for another year. The complexity of the grain collection procedures and the unfair distribution of burdens should be adjusted and simplified. In addition, all kinds of malpractices during grain collection, such as inaccurate weighing, adding extra weight, kicking and slapping the measuring container, raising one side while lowering the other, scraping the container, mixing in poor quality grain, and demanding extra transportation fees, should be strictly prohibited and severely punished to appease public anger and reassure the people. As for the illegal corruption of officials and their abuse of power, the supervisory organization should be strengthened and rewards and punishments should be clearly defined. In some provinces, such as Jiangsu and Zhejiang, the land tax is particularly heavy. If adjustments are not made in time, reductions should be considered to ensure fairness. In short, the collection of land tax in kind is intended to benefit the national economy and should avoid disturbing the people as much as possible, so as not to betray the country's good intentions. Furthermore, in areas where disasters occur, the reporting procedures should be simplified. Once a disaster is reported, the province can first verify and approve reductions and exemptions so that the victims can receive practical benefits and their lives are not buried by bureaucratic rhetoric.</p>
<p>Regarding the decision to continue collecting land tax in kind for another year, Chairman Chiang has repeatedly stated this at the financial revenue and expenditure system meetings. Moreover, Chairman Chiang cares about the people's hardships and has repeatedly given instructions on preventing malpractices in the implementation of the collection in kind. We hope that the extension of the collection of land tax in kind can eliminate the accumulated malpractices of previous years. We especially hope that the local supervisory commissions will seriously supervise the collection of land tax so that it can be free of corruption. Then the people will surely increase their trust and love for the government. Only in this way can China embark on the road of national construction and move towards the goal of national revival.</p>

<h3>The Trend of Universal Suffrage in Turkey is Confirmed; The Republican People's Party Wins; The Soviet Union Takes the Opportunity to Criticize Turkey's Foreign Policy</h3>
<p>[Reuter, London, 23rd] The election results in 57 of the 63 provinces in Turkey today show that the ruling Republican People's Party won 353 seats, the Democratic Party won 35 seats, and the Independent Party won 3 seats. Government candidates won all the seats in 38 provinces. In Kars and Ardahan, which the Soviets consider part of Greater Armenia, the government party received far more votes than other parties.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Istanbul, 22nd] Democratic Party leader Mr. Bayar issued a statement today, accusing the government of manipulating yesterday's election by using "harsh repressive measures." The voting was relatively peaceful. However, the pre-election conflict once reached a climax. Four people were killed, and a large contingent of military police guarded the polling stations. The elected members will serve a four-year term and have the right to elect the cabinet, which will be selected from among the members. The new National Assembly is scheduled to meet on January 5th.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, London, 22nd] Moscow Radio broadcast a TASS dispatch from Istanbul, stating that the Turkish government authorities committed numerous illegal acts in yesterday's election. The election was not secret; no polling station had a private room, and voting was inconveniently conducted on the street, at entrances, doorways, parks, and parking lots. At the same time, the Moscow Workers' Daily also stated that complaints and reports of turmoil, threats, and bewilderment from voters were heard throughout Turkey. President Inönü's People's Party followed a pro-German policy during the war, which caused significant damage to Turkey. At the same time, Turkey has repeatedly shown an unfriendly attitude towards the Soviet Union.</p>
<h3>Bombing Incident in Jerusalem; British Government Attaches Great Importance; The Number of Casualties Has Now Increased to Ninety; Jewish Immigration Case is Severely Affected</h3>
<p>[Our Report] London, 23rd Broadcast: Regarding the bombing of the British military headquarters in Jerusalem, British Prime Minister Attlee stated in the House of Commons today that such actions are tantamount to murder and irrational acts of terrorism, and said that Britain will not retreat because of such actions. Eden asked if the British government was prepared to take immediate action, and Attlee replied, "Without a doubt." According to the latest reports, the number of deaths and injuries from yesterday's bombing has reached 45 each.</p>
<p>[French News Agency, Jerusalem, 23rd] The unprecedented bombing of the British military headquarters in the King David Hotel here yesterday has shocked the Palestinian Jews and aroused unanimous indignation. The bombing was the largest sabotage operation in Palestine. So far, 60 soldiers and civilians have been confirmed dead, including several senior British government officials. The Jews are stunned by this tragedy. They fear that this crime will arouse the indignation of the world, even among sympathizers of Judaism. According to the investigation, the terrorists disguised themselves as laborers and infiltrated the ground floor of the hotel. There were five of them in total, all dressed in Arab clothes, carrying milk cans containing explosives. After taking control of the hotel staff, they put the bombs in the freight elevator. The group then went to the British military nightclub connected to the hotel, where they were stopped by a British officer, whom they immediately injured. The terrorists arrived at the nightclub, expelled all the staff, and then placed another bomb. After completing their task, the terrorists fled the hotel, got into a car waiting 200 yards away, and drove off. Although the hotel sounded the alarm and the police arrived immediately, it was too late to arrest the perpetrators. One corner of the five-story King David Hotel was completely destroyed by the explosion. The hotel's facilities were among the best in the Middle East, and the interior of the hotel is now in a state of disarray.</p>
<h3>200,000 Workers in Bombay Stage a General Strike for One Day; Fortunately, No Incidents Occurred</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Bombay, 22nd] 200,000 workers in Bombay went on a 24-hour general strike today in sympathy with the postal and telecommunications workers' strike. Military police were on guard at key intersections all day, and no unfortunate incidents have been reported.</p>
<p>[Reuters, New Delhi, 22nd] A "New York Times" reporter noted that labor unrest in India is intensifying day by day. Bombay is almost isolated from the outside world in terms of transportation. Workers in other parts of the country are also dissatisfied. The current labor crisis in India is perhaps the most serious since the 1928 railway strike. Although it is too early to say that this uneasy situation has political significance, Indian leaders are now closely watching its development. Therefore, foreign observers believe that it is not difficult to derive its political symbolism. The Congress Party is powerless to do anything about it, and although the Communist Party is small, it is systematically encouraging labor unrest. In fact, very few of the striking workers truly understand Marxism. The Indian Communist Party is now free to do as it pleases because it is not constrained by the British-Indian negotiations and can incite millions of poorly paid Indian workers.</p>
<h3>Byrnes Urges the Publication of the Draft Treaty; Byrnes is Scheduled to Depart for Europe on Friday</h3>
<p>[US Information Service, Washington, 22nd] US Secretary of State Byrnes recently sent a telegram to the foreign ministers of Britain, France, and the Soviet Union, urging them to promptly publish the draft treaties with Italy, Bulgaria, Romania, Hungary, and Finland. A State Department spokesperson said that Undersecretary of State Dean Acheson had made this request several times, but the Soviet representative stated that this was a matter for the peace conference itself, not for any undersecretary or foreign minister. According to the State Department, Byrnes is scheduled to depart for Paris on the 27th to attend the peace conference.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Paris, 22nd] Regarding the US proposal to publish the draft treaties of the five countries, France can agree, provided that Britain and the Soviet Union do the same.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, New York, 22nd] A dispatch from Paris: According to the recently drafted treaty, Italy, the Balkan countries, and Finland will be deprived of all means of waging war. This treaty will be discussed at the Paris Peace Conference.</p>
<h3>International Health Conference Establishes Agreement; China and India are Responsible for Convening the First Meeting</h3>
<p>[French News Agency, New York, 22nd] The International Health Conference has established an agreement to maintain a world health organization, which has now been signed by 63 representatives, including four covering documents: (1) the final regulations of the Health Conference, (2) the organizational regulations, which must be submitted to the governments of the countries concerned for approval (only China and Britain have already approved), (3) the agreement on the temporary recommendations and the temporary committee established, and (4) the agreement on the establishment of the International Office of Public Health in Paris. In addition, representatives from China and India on the temporary committee are responsible for convening the first International Health Conference.</p>
<h3>US Authorities are Striving to Promote German Administrative and Economic Unity; Authorize the Commander of US Forces in Germany to Negotiate with Related Countries</h3>
<p>[US Information Service, Washington, 22nd] The State Department today released Byrnes' instructions to General McNarney, commander of US forces in Germany, regarding the steps to be taken for economic unity in the US occupation zone of Germany. It stated that the US government firmly believes that the administration of Germany cannot continue to be divided into four unrelated zones without free economic exchange. According to the current situation, if this continues for a long time, it will inevitably cause economic paralysis in Germany. However, the US government is unwilling to allow this paralysis. Byrnes also proposed that economic unity should be implemented as soon as possible. He declared that the United States does not intend to partition Germany but intends to treat it as a single economic unit. He authorized McNarney to immediately negotiate with the occupying authorities of any zone or zones if the US proposal is not accepted by the representatives of the countries concerned, so as to implement the treatment of each occupying zone as an economic unit. The instructions praised that any agreement made with any government could be joined by other related countries at any time. McNarney was also authorized to cooperate with the three occupying governments to establish appropriate administrative agreements, the scope of which includes finance, transportation, communications, industry, and foreign trade. Regarding the French occupation zone, Byrnes authorized McNarney to negotiate with the French representatives, but the Saar region is not included in any economic unity agreement.</p>
<h3>Two US Military Officers Disappear in the Soviet Occupation Zone of Germany; Believed to be Due to Robbery</h3>
<p>[Our Report] San Francisco, 23rd Broadcast: Two US military officers stationed in the US occupation forces in Germany disappeared in the Soviet occupation zone. According to a French officer familiar with the two US military officers, Soviet soldiers were secretly selling diamonds not long ago. The US military officer intended to buy diamonds as a gift for his wife, who was about to arrive in Berlin from the United States. It is believed that the disappearance of the two men may be due to robbery.</p>
<h3>Revolutionary New Government Established in Bolivia; US Recognition Still Pending</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 22nd] A revolution occurred in Bolivia, and the government of former President Villarroel was overthrown and replaced by a revolutionary government. Diplomatic circles here expect that the United States will take a more friendly attitude towards the new government. According to State Department officials, the situation in La Paz is still chaotic, but the relationship between the United States and the former Bolivian government has always been cold and distant. That government came to power through a violent coup in 1943, and the United States did not recognize it for several months.</p>
<p>[French News Agency, Washington, 22nd] A State Department spokesperson stated that the United States' recognition of the new government of Bolivia is based on two principles: (1) the new government should first prove that it can maintain law and order and respect the law, and (2) the new government must guarantee compliance with the international agreements concluded by the previous government.</p>
<p>[French News Agency, Rio de Janeiro, 22nd] According to news from the capital of Bolivia, the revolutionary movement in that country is led by the Colorado Party. However, labor unrest in La Paz is still ongoing. Colonel Espenhart, the former Bolivian military attaché to Brazil, has reportedly been appointed as foreign minister.</p>

<h3>Britain is Expanding Fortifications in Singapore; To Make it a Military Base in the Far East; Using 20,000 Japanese Prisoners of War to Build Barracks</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Singapore, 23rd] The war and the changes in the Indian political situation have made Singapore a military base instead of a defensive base. When the Japanese attacked Singapore in December 1941, Malaya had no defensive works. The British army had no tanks and no flat-trajectory guns, and the Royal Air Force was incomplete. It is expected that this situation will not be seen again in the future. Singapore will become the military center and base for the entire Southeast Asia in the future, not just for the navy. According to Major General Cox, commander of the Singapore Defense Force, when Britain's main base in East Asia was located in India, Singapore had only a small amount of ammunition. In the future, it will be greatly increased. In the event of war, it can be used for long-term resistance. Singapore is the gateway to the Far East and Australia and must be made a base in the Far East. For a considerable period of time, Singapore should maintain a considerable number of troops. 20,000 Japanese prisoners of war are being ordered to build barracks for the British army. Currently, there are 45,000 troops stationed in Singapore.</p>
<p>Worker Strike</p>
<p>[Reuters, Singapore, 22nd] 15,000 workers at the Singapore naval base have gone on strike because wage increase negotiations have broken down. Because the workers do not have responsible leaders, it is difficult to conduct negotiations.</p>
<h3>China Requests the Return of Small Islands Near Taiwan; Dispute with the Philippines Occurs</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Manila, 23rd] Philippine Foreign Minister Quirino stated today that the Philippine government is preparing a note requesting the abolition of the 1930 treaty that gave Britain administrative jurisdiction over the Turtle Islands (outside North Borneo). This treaty was signed by the United States and Britain, and the Philippine government will inquire with the United States about the treaty relationship. It also stated that China has a dispute with the Philippines over the ownership of the small islands of Sirengeito, which are located 200 miles west of Palawan Island. The Philippines intends to incorporate them into its national defense scope. The Sirengeito islands were jointly occupied by France and Japan before the war. After China recovered sovereignty over Taiwan this time, it requested their return on the grounds that the small islands previously belonged to the administrative region of Taiwan.</p>
<h3>World Trade Preparatory Committee to be Held in England in October</h3>

<h3>Doihara's Crimes are Obvious; Qin Dechun Testifies Again Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 23rd Special Dispatch] General Qin Dechun, Deputy Minister of National Defense of China, testified for the second time at the International Tribunal this morning and refuted the defense presented by Doihara's defense lawyer, Naoki Shikiyo, stating: "The 'Lawrence of Manchuria,' Doihara, always gave General Song Zheyuan and Chu Minyi a headache. Doihara exerted considerable pressure in North China. Although Song and Chu agreed to the establishment of the Hebei-Chahar Political Council in order to maintain peace in North China, they never supported the 'autonomy movement' in North China." At this point, Shikiyo produced a Chinese painting and claimed that the painting was given to Doihara by General Song Zheyuan in "gratitude for his cooperation." When the painting was opened in front of Qin, Qin smiled and immediately replied: "This painting was given when Doihara left China. It is very common in our country for officials to exchange gifts, so it cannot be used as evidence favorable to the defendant." Shikiyo then tried to explain that the night military exercises conducted by the Japanese army in Chinese territory nine years ago were legal, claiming that the Boxer Protocol granted Japan the privilege of conducting military exercises in Chinese territory. Qin immediately retorted: "Then China should have been notified in advance, and the local authorities should have informed the local residents." At this point, Shikiyo tried to explain that the Japanese army's invasion of China was reasonable. He pointed out the Tongzhou incident on July 29 and the second shooting incident in Beiping on July 26. Regarding this point, Qin retorted that the shooting began on the morning of July 8, 1937, and stopped after the Tongzhou and Beiping shooting incidents occurred, until the end of the war last year. He said that his statement that Doihara was the instigator of the Mukden Incident was based on Chinese intelligence and reports from various other parties. Today, when the defense lawyer of the defendant Iwane Matsui listened to General Qin Dechun's testimony in court, he pointed out that Song Zheyuan, Han Fuqu, and Qin had all participated in the Greater East Asia Conference. Qin replied: "I know that one person participated. This person is Qi Xieyuan, who was being tried in our country for treason."</p>
<h3>Atomic Bomb Re-test Nears: Target Ships Positioned, Ships Will Be Sucked to the Bottom During Explosion</h3>
<p>[United Press, USS Appalaichian, 22nd] Aboard the reporter ship USS Appalaichian, today we sailed into Bikini Lagoon to observe the positioning of the target ships for the first underwater atomic bomb test. The arrangement of these ships has been completely changed. The battleship Nevada, which was the target in the July 1st test, is no longer at the center. It has been replaced by the battleship Arkansas and the aircraft carrier Saratoga. To the west are six submarines, some submerged and some on the surface. Within them are six transport ships. The battleship New York is stationed on the inner line, east of the barge holding the atomic bomb. To the north of the "dead circle" is the Arkansas, flanked by a submarine, a landing craft, and a cargo ship. Behind it is the Japanese battleship Nagato. To the north of the Nagato is the Nevada, and beyond that is a row of landing craft. The German cruiser Prinz Eugen is positioned on the advantageous outer line of the targets. On the west side of the inner line are the cruiser Pensacola and the aircraft carrier Independence, both of which were heavily damaged in the first test and are now placed in a dangerous position again. Several transport ships are arranged on the southwestern edge. Multiple light ships are scattered throughout the entire target fleet, along with a floating dock and a steel-framed barge.</p>
<p>[United Press, Bikini, 23rd] The underwater atomic bomb explosion test, scheduled for dawn on the 25th, may be delayed due to tropical weather developing over the Marshall Islands. General Blandy personally supervised the submersion of the submarine Apogon today. A total of six submarines will submerge, while the other two will remain on the surface in the target area.</p>
<p>[United Press, Reporter Ship USS Appalaichian, 22nd] The director of the atomic bomb test's scientific and technical department, Sou Yi, predicted that new phenomena will occur in naval warfare. Ships will first be sucked to the bottom and then thrown out of the water at crazy angles. When the fifth atomic bomb explodes underwater, it appears that one million to ten million tons of seawater will be thrown into the air, creating a water column 1,000 feet in diameter and 10 feet high. A large hole, 100 feet deep, will open on the surface. Nearby ships will be sucked into this hole.</p>
<h3>East Indies Should Be Renamed the United States of Indonesia: Van Mook's Proposal</h3>

<h3>Gold Brick Case Trial Opens: Six Defendants Simultaneously File Motions, Chen Yuansheng Confesses in Court, Stole Out of Speculative Failure, Suffered Nervous Stimulus in Waiting Room, Cried and Laughed Uncontrollably</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The chief culprit in the Central Bank gold brick theft case, Chen Yuansheng, was put on trial by Judge Zhong Xianda in the Second Criminal Court of the District Court yesterday afternoon. At 8:30 a.m. yesterday, when Chen was escorted from the Sinan Road Detention Center to the Northern Zhejiang Road District Court by several bailiffs, he suddenly suffered a nervous breakdown in the court's waiting room, crying and laughing uncontrollably, speaking incoherently. At 2:30 p.m., when he was brought to the courtroom, he returned to normal. Chen Yuansheng hired lawyer Sun Lishi for his defense. The other defendants, Wu Minggang, Wang Shumei, Chen Youqing, Shi Xianglong, and Yu Shiyang, also hired lawyers for their defense. At exactly 2:30 p.m., the trial began. Chen Yuansheng stated: 30 years old, from Zhejiang. He joined the Central Bank in 1933 and was a staff member of the Custody Department before the crime. At that time, his base salary was 60 yuan, and according to the cost of living index, his monthly income was about 140,000 to 150,000 yuan. He has an elderly mother and older siblings, with whom he does not live separately. The gold bricks, etc., were entrusted to him by the Custody Department Director for safekeeping. Because the salary he earned could not support his family, he engaged in speculation. He first stole stocks and US dollars. Because he had losses, he stole gold bricks and public bonds to try to make up for them. The gold bricks were initially pawned to Pan Jialiu, a former Central Bank colleague who is now the Assistant Manager of the Shanghai City Bank, at an interest rate of 16%. Because they were not redeemed after the expiration date, they were sold by the other party. The Class C public bonds were given to Yu Shiyang, whom he met during transactions. Chen also stated that the gold bricks had the English words "Central Bank of Manchuria" on them. When he went to Hangzhou, he carried three taels of gold bars, 4,000 American Asia stocks, and 300,000 yuan in cash.</p>
<p>Wu Minggang stated: 33 years old, from Sichuan, Assistant Manager of the Shanghai Chongqing Bank. The gold bricks were introduced by Pan Jialiu. Because he trusted Pan, he did not look closely. The gold bricks were brought by Yang Dehui, Deputy Section Chief of the Business Department of the Shanghai City Bank. Because the Bankers' Association had issued a notice that gold bricks could be used as collateral, he accepted them. The interest rate was 13.5%.</p>
<p>Wang Shumei stated: 34 years old, from Ningbo, engaged in the stock business. He was introduced by Pan Jialiu to use his name to pawn the gold bricks. Because he trusted Pan, he did not ask about the source of the gold bricks. He earned an interest of 2.5%. He did not know about the rest of the sale.</p>
<p>Chen Youqing stated: 26 years old, from Zhenjiang, Deputy Manager of the Santai Silver Shop on Sichuan Road. He purchased the gold bricks from Yang Dehui, Deputy Section Chief of the Business Department of the Shanghai City Bank, on May 4th at a price of 1,615,000 yuan per bar. Because he trusted Yang Dehui, he did not investigate the source of the gold bricks. These gold bricks were later melted into small pieces by the Xianghe Silver Shop and sold.</p>
<p>Shi Xianglong stated: 35 years old, from Yuyao, working at the Xianghe Silver Shop. He had dealings with Chen Youqing, so he knew him. He personally received the gold bricks on May 4th. He opened them and looked at them, but he did not understand English. The melting fee was 4 qian 5 fen 3 li of gold.</p>
<p>Yu Shiyang stated: Engaged in the money shop business. He initially did not know that Chen Yuansheng was a staff member of the Central Bank. Chen said on May 22nd that he wanted to sell the public bonds he had deposited, but they were not sold. Chen Yuansheng also stated: The public bonds were divided into four packages, with the Central Bank's seal on them. He only speculated for two or three months. The public bonds were never sold. He first used US dollars, and later pawned gold bricks to make up for the US dollars. At this point, Pan Jialiu, Assistant Manager of the City Bank, was summoned to the court. He stated: From Wuxian, he and Chen Yuansheng were trainees at the Central Bank in 1935, so they knew each other. Because Chen insisted on asking for help in finding funds, he introduced him to pawn the gold bricks.</p>
<h3>Central Bank Files Incidental Private Lawsuit Demanding Compensation for Gold Bricks</h3>
<p>At that time, Shu Zhiguan, Deputy Director of the Business Bureau of the Central Bank, represented by lawyer Zuo De, stood up and filed an incidental civil lawsuit, demanding that the five defendants jointly compensate for 453 taels 2 qian 3 fen of gold bricks, and that Chen Yuansheng alone compensate for 5,358,492 yuan 8 jiao 1 fen. Because the public bonds have been returned, compensation is not sought. At this point, Judge Zhong announced that the trial would be adjourned for another hearing.</p>
<p>[Another report] According to defendant's lawyer Sun Lishi, Chen Yuansheng was a temporary employee of the Custody Department of the Central Bank's Business Bureau, without a letter of appointment, so he cannot be prosecuted as a civil servant. Moreover, Chen committed the crime due to speculative failure, which was caused by the social environment.</p>
<h3>Refugee Youths from Northern Jiangsu Send Letter to Zhou Enlai</h3>
<p>Questioning the Atrocities of the Communist Army</p>
<p>The Refugee Youths Returning Home Group from Linzhong, Jiangsu, in Anhui, the Northern Jiangsu Youth Association in Shanghai, the Jianfu Refugee Youth Group, and the Shanghai Northern Jiangsu Refugee Students' Mutual Aid Association, etc., considering that the Communist army in Northern Jiangsu has recently launched a large-scale political offensive, harming the local people and poisoning the population, and the future is not optimistic, and returning home is even more uncertain, gathered over 340 representatives from various units at 734 Zhongshan North Road, the Jianghuai Fellow Villagers' Association, at 1 p.m. yesterday to discuss solutions. They jointly decided to co-sign a letter to the Communist Party representative Zhou Enlai, questioning the atrocities of the Communist army in Northern Jiangsu, and sent Li Guangheng, Fang Yunzhong, Wu Zusong, Wang Qingyun, Sun Xu, and other six representatives to visit Zhou that night, deliver the letter of inquiry, and request a public response in the newspapers.</p>
<h3>General Xie Jinyuan's Family Lives in Misery</h3>
<p>After the martyr General Xie Jinyuan, a hero of the Lone Army, passed away, his affairs were in disarray, and his family lived in extreme misery.

<h3>Zhu Xuefan Talks About Impressions of Moscow: Large Population, Tense Work, High Heels and Permed Hair: Soviet Women are No Exception</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The "World Federation of Trade Unions," an organization of 70 million workers from 55 countries around the world, held its first Executive Committee meeting in Moscow in mid-June of this year. The Chinese delegation was attended by Zhu Xuefan, Chairman of the Chinese Labor Association. The conference agenda consisted of five major points. After the closing ceremony, the Soviet Trade Union Federation hosted all 27 delegates, touring Leningrad. On the 9th of this month, Zhu returned to Shanghai via Vladivostok, arriving safely in Shanghai on the 21st by ship.</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, Zhu Xuefan spoke to reporters from this newspaper about his impressions of Leningrad and Moscow. Leningrad, a metropolis with a population of over 3 million, is a port of entry and exit for millions of tons of goods. Coal and machinery from England and cotton from the United States are imported here in exchange for timber. The tragic destruction of the war has now been restored to its usual state. Over 90% of the buildings have been repaired, with only the area near the sea still under reconstruction. Many soldiers have returned home after demobilization, so it seems unprecedentedly crowded. The most pressing issue at present is still housing.</p>
<p>Regarding the general situation in the Soviet Union at present, Zhu said: "An average worker can earn about 250 rubles per month (the official price is 5.30 rubles per US dollar), while skilled workers can earn 2,000 to 3,000 or more. The highest-paid academicians of the Academy of Sciences earn almost over 30,000. All prices are controlled, and the quantity purchased is limited. Unless you have extra money, you can buy some items in addition to rations at prices ten or eight times higher than the official price from stores. Production focuses on heavy industry and the manufacture of necessities. Luxury goods are rarely found among imported goods. The mandarin oranges that can be bought everywhere in Shanghai are not available in the Soviet Union. Even the ships traveling between Shanghai and Vladivostok bring enough of their domestically produced food and never purchase them abroad." However, there are also women wearing high heels and permed hair on Moscow's main streets. They also love to dress up, but there are fewer of them compared to the general world metropolis. The majority of working women's clothing is still as simple as it was during the war. There are two large hotels in Moscow that also have dance floors. Entertainment includes opera and ballet. Hollywood movies also have a large audience there. Zhu has two impressions of Moscow: a large population (with a population of 6.1 million) and tense work. The fourth five-year plan has now begun.</p>
<p>At this time, the reporter asked the last question: "Is the Soviet Union still as strictly controlling the news as before?" I received an affirmative answer. He said: "Yes, they still control the news. Often, after we finished the conference in Moscow, we hosted reporters from various countries. At that time, a British reporter asked whether the Executive Committee would check. The representative of the Soviet Trade Union Federation replied: If the dispatch is entirely factual, it will be passed, otherwise it will be withheld. It can be seen that the Soviet Union still checks news telegrams." As for what is fact and what is not, it will probably be based on the subjective opinion of the checker.</p>

<p>Business News</p>
<h3>Financial Vice Minister Xu Boyuan Issues Statement; The Question of Whether to Abolish the Joint Treasury; Banks Can Decide on Loans Under 50 Million</h3>
<p>Recently, Shanghai newspapers have reported that the mission of the Joint Treasury has been completed and should be dissolved. According to Xu Boyuan, Political Vice Minister of Finance and Secretary-General of the Joint Treasury, he cannot express any opinion on the question of whether to abolish it. Regarding its establishment and main tasks, he stated that the Joint Treasury was established in Shanghai after the outbreak of the August 13th Shanghai War. Its main task was to unite the strength of the four banks to stabilize finance and support the long-term war of resistance. Therefore, after its establishment, it set up branches and joint lending committees in major commercial ports. When the government moved west, the head offices of the banks were established in Chongqing and Hong Kong. To ensure that the banks acted in unison and effectively assisted the government in implementing national policies, the central government promulgated the Outline of Measures for Consolidating Finance in the autumn of the 28th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1939], increasing the authority and strengthening the organization of the Joint Treasury. The operations of the China Trust and Postal Remittances Bureaus were also subsequently placed under the supervision of the Joint Treasury. The highest leader and chairman of the board of directors were appointed by the heads of the ministries of finance, economy, transportation, and food, as well as the presidents, vice presidents, and general managers of the four banks, respectively. The Joint Treasury handled important tasks such as lending for production enterprises, expanding agricultural loans, promoting various types of reserves, coordinating the allocation of military and government remittances, centralizing the issuance of banknotes, standardizing the accounting of various banks, implementing the division of business between banks and bureaus, supervising banks and bureaus in handling post-war recovery, and laying out the national financial network. The decisions on various policies and guidelines of the Joint Treasury, as well as the handling of various loan cases, were first submitted to various small groups, with the participation of the heads of relevant departments and relevant leaders from each bank to provide opinions. The nature of the Joint Treasury is essentially a coalition of various banks and bureaus. Its mission is to coordinate and collaborate the business of various banks and bureaus, to communicate the national financial guidelines and the government's economic policies to ensure close cooperation, and to continuously plan and promote various financial and economic implementations in many ways. I dare say that since the establishment of the Joint Treasury, the four banks and two bureaus have worked together to make a considerable contribution to the collective efforts of the country. It has not been long since the return of the capital, and some people may not fully understand the situation of the Joint Treasury. Regarding the handling of various loans, outsiders believe that the procedures are slow, difficult to approve, and the approved amount often fails to meet the needs. He said that such criticism was already heard in Chongqing. The Treasury has always handled loan approvals fairly, in accordance with established principles, and the loan amount is determined based on the actual needs of the manufacturer. As long as the application forms are complete and the other conditions are met, they are handled quickly. Recently, it has been decided that loans under 50 million will be approved directly by each bank or bureau, further simplifying the procedures. However, the financial resources of the banks and bureaus are not unlimited, and loans to industrial and commercial enterprises, under the national financial and economic policy, must also be subject to certain standards.</p>
<h3>Chinese Stocks Initially Firm, Then Weak</h3>
<p>Foreign stocks also declined across the board.</p>
<p>Chinese stocks fluctuated erratically, with active trading. Except for Wing On, which managed to maintain support, the rest lacked momentum. The prospect of Mayer &amp; Co. issuing stock dividends was uncertain, causing significant declines. The market initially showed firmness but later weakened. Major bullish investors still exited the market, suggesting a temporary pause. The highest prices were seen for Wing On Textile at 713 yuan, Mayer &amp; Co. at 4950 yuan, Jingfu at 285 yuan, Xinguang at 280 yuan, and Qinxing at 205 yuan. All experienced declines by noon. Generally, Mayer &amp; Co. and Qinxing traded at lower prices, while Wing On Textile, Jingfu, and Xinguang were higher than their morning opening prices. Less popular small and medium-sized stocks, as well as veteran stocks, showed renewed signs of weakness, resulting in Wing On Textile rising slightly compared to the previous close, while Mayer &amp; Co., Jingfu, and Xinguang fell slightly. Qinxing fell by half a percent, while the less popular small and medium-sized stocks each fell by about half a percent. Veteran stocks were also affected.</p>
<p>Foreign stocks initially showed stability in the morning but ultimately lacked support. As Chinese stocks declined, securities dealers continued to liquidate their positions. Ewo Silk Mills retreated from 9900 to 9200 before stabilizing somewhat. British American Tobacco, after opening at 9800, also proved unsustainable. The rest fared even worse, with more selling than buying. As a result, compared to the previous close, Ewo Silk Mills and British American Tobacco declined slightly, while Ewo Brewery, Jardine Matheson, Taikoo Dockyard, Yee Tsoong Paper, and Asia declined by about half a percent each.</p>
<h3>Gold Prices Rise with US Dollars</h3>
<p>Gold bullion was boosted by the rise in US dollars yesterday. It opened at 1.958 million in the morning, and buyers emerged slightly, pushing the price up to around 1.98 million. The Central Bank distributed 43 bars at a price of 1.97 million. After 10:00 AM, prices declined slightly. Although the US dollar showed several surges, general sentiment, influenced by the Mexican bank's gold selling price of just over 40 yuan, which was much lower than in Shanghai, did not stimulate the market. Instead, the gold market weakened slightly, trading around 1.965 million at noon. The market stabilized slightly in the afternoon, resulting in a gain of 13,000 compared to the previous close. Gold ornaments rose to 1.01 million, while silver bullion and silver dollars remained unchanged. The black market interest rate remained around 13%.</p>
<p>Foreign currencies generally benefited from the Central Bank's announcement that cash could be used for foreign exchange settlement, leading to active buying. It opened at 2530 yuan in the morning, with demand exceeding supply. After some fluctuations, the price rose to 2640 yuan. As some physical currency flowed out, the price fell back to around 2580 yuan at noon. The market recovered slightly in the afternoon, resulting in a gain of 75 yuan compared to the previous close. Hong Kong dollars were initially firm but later leveled off, rising to over 570 yuan, resulting in a gain of 8 yuan compared to the previous close. The Hong Kong exchange rate was around 560 yuan, the Indian exchange rate was around 680 yuan, and the British exchange rate was around 9000 yuan. The US exchange rate remained inactive.</p>
<h3>Brisk Tea Sales</h3>
<p>Domestic sales of black and green tea are improving, with buying interest from various quarters increasing daily. O.P. "Made in Taiwan" black tea, Chen Ding Qimen tea, and Yuan Yuan Chen stir-fried green tea are in high demand, with supply failing to meet demand, pushing up prices. As for the foreign trade tea market, various tea merchants are still interested in Yuan Yuan Chen special grade tea, but the trend seems to be stabilizing. If the price of Wenzhou Xin Zhen Mei tea is right, exporters are also interested in purchasing it.</p>
<h3>Spun Yarn Continues to Rise; Active Spot Cotton Trading</h3>
<p>The yarn market was quiet yesterday, with weak demand, but underlying support remained firm. The output of Suzhou yarn was also considerably reduced. Demand for 20-count spun yarn from fabric factories remained strong, and prices continued to rise by 30,000 to 40,000. The fortunes of other 20-count yarns varied. Due to the limited supply of 42-count and 32-count fine yarns, prices rose by around 20,000.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the New York cotton market showed mediocre conditions, with fluctuations of 3-5 points. The near-term price was 35.77 USD, the forward price was 35.81 USD, and the middling price was 36.47 USD. Spot cotton trading in Shanghai was peaceful. Private yarn factories such as Xinsheng, Shenxin, and Jiafeng were more active in purchasing. Transactions involving different grades remained active, and prices remained stable with a slight upward trend.</p>
<h3>Rice Prices Continue to Fall</h3>
<p>Yesterday, 8795 shi of rice arrived in the North and South Rice Markets, but sales remained sluggish. Prices continued to fall by 1000-2000 yuan, with lower grades declining by another 2000-3000 yuan. Wheat from Shantou was slightly higher, and the market was stable. Ningbo prices were firm but not strong, with tight purchase prices. Closing prices were weak. Flour declined slightly by 100-200 yuan. Oil prices jumped sharply by 4000-5000 yuan due to supply falling short of demand. Soybean oil remained stable. Soybean cake sales were sluggish. Soybeans, driven by slight activity in Shantou and Ningbo, turned from weak to firm, rising by 600-700 yuan. Raw peanuts were selling well, causing prices to soar by 4000-5000 yuan.</p>
<h3>China Trust Intends to Purchase Qihong Tea</h3>
<p>Existing stock approximately 15,000 boxes; total could reach 280,000 boxes</p>
<p>Tea merchants plan to send representatives to Beijing to request an extension of loan repayment and a new loan of 10 billion yuan to facilitate the transformation of spring tea, including packaging, transportation, and the continued purchase of tea, as well as autumn harvest expenses. It has been heard that the China Trust Bureau is considering purchasing Qihong tea to barter with the Soviet Union. A decision has been made to first discuss countermeasures with the China Trust Bureau. The tea merchants' export guild is calling a meeting at 3:00 PM this afternoon, with an important proposal to telegraph all members to ship the finished black tea, costing 270,000 yuan and totaling 15,000 boxes, along with all 200+ samples, from various places to Shanghai for public evaluation before submitting them to the China Trust Bureau. According to tea industry insiders, in addition to the 15,000 boxes of Qimen tea already produced, the potential output could reach around 280,000 boxes. The output of Tunxi Pingshui (Shaoxing) green tea is four to five times higher than that of Qimen.</p>
<h3>Adjusted Electricity Usage Results in Sharp Reduction in China Textile Production</h3>
<p>Employee subsidies paid at 70%</p>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] According to sources at the China Textile Construction Company, since the Shanghai Electric Power Company began adjusting electricity usage at the end of May, the total output of the company's factories has been reduced by one-third compared to its peak period. Currently, over 400,000 spindles and over 8,000 looms are in operation daily, with a daily output of approximately 700 bales of cotton yarn and approximately 17,000 pieces of cotton cloth.</p>
<p>It is also reported that the company's employee compensation has been reduced across the board since July, in accordance with the instructions of Minister of Economic Affairs Wang Yunwu. It is heard that the reduction is being implemented by paying employees' subsidies at 70%. This reduction in compensation applies equally to technical and administrative personnel, with no discrimination. The base salary of technical personnel at the company has always been higher than that of administrative personnel. After the implementation of this reduction in compensation, an employee with a base salary of 100 yuan can receive approximately 300,000 yuan per month, in addition to free meals and accommodation provided by the company.</p>
<p>Slack Bond Market</p>
<p>Except for Class A and B bonds, which were slightly absorbed by a major player on the fifth floor and remained relatively stable, the rest showed no significant activity, with limited fluctuations and a sluggish market. Class C bonds traded at a low of 800 yuan and a high of 850 yuan, resulting in a decline of 50 yuan compared to the previous close. Class A and B remained unchanged, Class D declined by 50 yuan, and Class E declined by 30 yuan.</p>
<p>Slightly Weak Brown Sugar</p>
<p>The sugar market trend turned flat yesterday, due to a certain firm's intention to sell off a large number of goods, resulting in more favorable prices. However, no transactions were completed. Chaozhou's first-grade refined sugar was still quoted at 94,000-95,000 yuan, with 40-50 bags of Chong Ti refined sugar opening at 91,000-90,000 yuan. Xinghua's first-grade powdered white sugar opened with 70-80 baskets at 127,000-128,000 yuan, and 50 baskets of Xinghua red sugar opened at 115,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>American Chamber of Commerce Application Approved by the Bureau of Social Affairs</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] This reporter recently learned from responsible persons at the American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai that the chamber has applied for registration with the Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs and has been approved. Currently, a total of 78 American businesses in Shanghai have joined the chamber as members. It is understood that a considerable number of American businesses operating in Shanghai have not joined the chamber, but the exact number is unknown. In 1941, the American Chamber of Commerce had 177 members. It is estimated that at that time, the total number of American businesses operating in Shanghai was over 200.</p>
<h3>Overseas Chinese Bank Opens Shanghai Branch Today</h3>
<p>The China Overseas Chinese Bank, founded by the wealthy Burmese merchant Liang Yushan, has recently established a branch at the intersection of Jiujiang Road and Henan Road in Shanghai, engaging in general commercial banking and savings trust services. It is scheduled to officially open today. The Overseas Chinese Bank's license was established in Kunming in the 31st year [of the Republic, i.e., 1942], with a capital of 100 million yuan. It is heard that it has been decided to move the Shanghai branch in the short term. The Shanghai branch manager is also serving as assistant manager Shu Yujie.</p>
<h3>Bumper Harvest in Southeastern Provinces</h3>
<p>Specific figures still to be statistically determined</p>
<p>After the Ministry of Food recently announced that food prices were falling in various places and a bumper harvest could be expected, the ministry received reports from Jiangxi, Guangdong, Fujian, and Hunan provinces stating that the autumn harvest has begun in various places and the harvest is very abundant. However, specific figures will need to await the completion of the harvest before they can be statistically determined. Jiangxi Province, with an extremely abundant harvest, is considering countermeasures to avoid "low grain prices harming farmers."</p>
<h3>British Exchange Rate Fluctuates with the Market; Positions Adjusted Regularly; The Truth Behind Foreign Exchange Settlement in the Sterling Area</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Yesterday, newspapers reported that the Central Bank has stipulated that, effective immediately, purchases from the Sterling Area must be settled in pounds sterling, and purchases from the US Dollar Area must be settled in US dollars. According to responsible parties at the Central Bank, this regulation has been in effect for some time. Although the Central Bank has not announced the telegraphic transfer rate for the pound sterling, import and export businesses with normal needs can obtain British exchange rates from designated banks. The Central Bank is responsible for adjusting the supply and demand of British exchange rates in the market. The price of the pound sterling is purely determined by market fluctuations.</p>
<h3>Bureau of Social Affairs Formulates Sugar Rationing Measures</h3>
<p>Registration begins immediately and ends on the 26th</p>
<p>The Bureau of Social Affairs has formulated sugar rationing measures with the Taiwan Sugar Corporation to suppress sugar prices. It has been decided that these measures will be implemented starting with the seventh batch of 15,000 bags of Taiwan sugar. All businesses operating in Shanghai that deal in North-South goods, tea, food, or also retail sugar; sugar, cookie, and cracker factories; Hua-fang doctors; groups; and consumer cooperatives that require sugar may declare the quantity they need and submit it to the Bureau of Social Affairs for verification and transmission to the Taiwan Sugar Corporation for rationing. The sugar rationed is limited to 20th-grade medium-grain white sugar, with the price temporarily set at 75,000 yuan per dan. In addition to the 1% commission given by the Taiwan Sugar Corporation, each distributor is allowed to add a legal profit. The price for selling in the original bag is set at 81,000 yuan per dan, and the price for selling in opened packages is 860 yuan per jin. In the future, rationing will be carried out once a week, with the quantity determined by need and the price not exceeding the aforementioned limits. Registration for the seventh batch begins immediately and ends on the 26th. Distributors must not raise prices, mix in impurities, deduct quantity, or conceal and refuse to sell. In addition to having the relevant trade associations provide a written guarantee, the Bureau of Social Affairs will send personnel to investigate at any time. All stores must display their distribution certificates and retail prices in conspicuous locations in front of the store. Citizens who purchase sugar from retailers must be limited to the quantity they actually need. If the quantity is excessive, they should submit a certificate for verification. If anyone is found hoarding sugar for resale for profit, they will be severely punished.</p>
<h3>Prices Soar in the United States; Up 25% in Two Weeks</h3>
<p>[Washington, DC, United States Information Service, 22nd] The White House announced today a statement from the Department of Commerce stating that agricultural products and imports should bear the greatest responsibility for stimulating inflation after the Price Control Authority was abolished on June 30. According to an economic survey report submitted by the Department of Commerce to President Truman, the daily market index of the Bureau of Labor Statistics showed that prices for 28 major commodities rose by 25% in the first 16 days of July. Although the elimination of subsidies was one reason for rising prices, the rate of price increase was actually higher than the previous subsidies. This situation was especially true for livestock prices. Currently, the prices of grains, beef, butter, lead, and zinc are higher than after the end of World War I in 1919. The details of the recent overall price increase are not yet fully understood. Although there is a proposal to re-establish the Price Control Authority, the rising price trend has not been curbed. The report concludes: "Without the proposal to restore the Price Control Authority, the rising price trend may be even worse than it is today."</p>

<h3>A Visit to Jiangwan Airfield</h3>
<p>— Zhu Minwei</p>
<p>Captain Mao Shangzhen drove a jeep. The vehicle was quite empty, carrying only this reporter as a passenger. His car bounced and jolted from his team headquarters onto the road to Jiangwan Airfield. After passing through the Sino-American military police checkpoint, the road revealed the rough and worn traces of day and night traffic. This very airfield, having received vital resources and brave warriors from the rear via the sky, is now, for those entering the bustling city, a place people naturally no longer think about, a desolate landing point.</p>
<p>Lieutenant Pilot</p>
<p>We followed a road marked with empty gasoline drums, and in an equally desolate command post, he introduced me to his operations officer, Zhu Peifeng. Zhu Peifeng is a lieutenant pilot in the air force. After graduating from the Sixteenth Class of the Air Force Officer School, he was assigned to the First Air Group as a trainee officer and pilot. Two years ago, his unique story had already attracted considerable attention. Before studying military aviation in the United States with other young men, he had already earned Bachelor's and Master's degrees in Engineering from Cambridge University in England.</p>
<p>When we met, he was planning flight routes at his desk, with an American officer waiting nearby. After finishing with the matter at hand, he stood up to talk to me. I sized him up. He was a man of medium height and broad build, older than his fellow flying students. As we talked, I learned that he was thirty-two years old.</p>
<p>A Daring Mission</p>
<p>To see the C-46 aircraft they were currently using, Mao Shangzhen switched to a medium-sized jeep. The slender Captain Mao was already suffering from a cold, but he willingly forced his body to obey his hospitality. The road from the command building to the aircraft parking area was equally bad. He drove quickly, then slowly, braking and starting on the rough road. Despite it being early summer, the wind in the open field carried sand and dust, blurring our vision. We spoke, but our words were quickly blown away by the wind and were difficult to hear.</p>
<p>In the car, Zhu Peifeng mentioned that he originally studied civil engineering in England and, after obtaining a Master's degree at Cambridge, went to the United States. In America, he saw the leading role of the aviation industry in society, so he entered the Pan American Airways (P.A.A.) Celestial Navigation School to study celestial navigation. His teacher was the same veteran celestial navigation expert who had taught Yi Fuen (I-Fu En) the year before. After completing this civilian aviation program, Zhu Peifeng saw that the world's wars were still unresolved, and many people were joining the air force to make their contributions. He simply decided to become a military aviator to fulfill his military duty. He obtained special permission from the air force authorities to enter the Sixteenth Class of the Air Force School for flight training in the United States. After graduating a year later, he immediately returned to China and was assigned to the First Air Group, serving as a B-29 bomber pilot. From bases in Liangshan, Sichuan; Zhijiang, Hunan; and Hanzhong and Ankang, Shaanxi, he attacked enemy positions in Henan, Hubei, Hunan, and Guangxi. During eight months of combat, he performed dangerous missions just like any other young man, without exception, despite being a trained engineer.</p>
<p>Two Hours of Flight</p>
<p>After the victory of the War of Resistance, he was sent to the United States to study in a special class at the U.S. Air Force Staff College. During the six-month period, in addition to practical skills, the academic subjects included thirty to forty books, equivalent to four years of study at a regular Chinese university, which had to be read and researched reports submitted within the deadline. Because he had already studied in England and the United States for many years, he was able to complete the assignments satisfactorily and on time.</p>
<p>When Zhu Peifeng was young, he lived a city life in Shanghai. Wanzhu Elementary School in the Nine Acres area of Nanshi was where he received his early education. His ancestral home was Fenghua, Zhejiang, but he rarely went there. Rural life, on the other hand, he experienced for a while while serving in the air force during the war.</p>
<p>Our car stopped in the C-46 parking area. Americans were constantly withdrawing from China, and these old C-46s were being gathered from various routes to this piece of land in Jiangwan. I took a look, and the area was about the size of the air transport base used at Xinjin, Sichuan, when B-29s bombed Kyushu, Japan. Captain Mao Shangzhen led me into the cockpit of the plane he was flying that day and explained the use of blind landing instruments and the piloting methods to me. His flight schedule for the day consisted of takeoffs and landings, a total of twelve times, amounting to two hours of flight. He would land, accelerate, take off, climb, and then land again. He planned to complete all the C-46 flight training within a week, without stopping even with his cold.</p>
<p>Visiting the Supply Depot</p>
<p>Stepping out of the plane, he led me to see the First Air Group's air transport equipment depot, which he had designed himself. I saw a large warehouse filled with a complete set of parts, from aircraft tires to electrical components, all neatly organized. The captain was doing his best to utilize his managerial skills. He said, "During the war, we didn't care about anything; we just focused on flying and fighting because the war came first. Plus, with the cruelty of war, if we were distracted by trivial matters, our lives might have been incinerated in the wreckage of a plane. But now, it's after the war, and our focus must shift to group affairs. General Zhou Zhirou (Chou Chih-Jou) has repeatedly instructed us on this. We, these thirty-somethings, should manage affairs rationally and avoid waste. Therefore, since coming to Shanghai to receive air transport training from the Americans, I have postponed my own flying until today. However, I have learned many methods for commanding subordinates and have begun to study management."</p>
<p>An Encouraging Military Unit</p>
<p>As we entered the city from Jiangwan together, Staff Officer Zhu Peifeng parted ways with us at the team headquarters. In the car seat, Shangzhen said: "This person inspires a bit of respect. Like Weng Xinhan (Weng Hsin-Han) from our class, he has a family background that could easily afford him fame and fortune without any effort, but he quietly does the low-level job he loves, filling his life history bit by bit. When his uncle heard about his plans to learn to fly, he felt a sense of quiet satisfaction, letting his nephew sweat and suffer, cooped up in a metal airplane under the scorching sun of the American desert. These past three years of hard work and danger have not been in vain. He has won the praise of the air force authorities and the admiration of his air force comrades. I am quite honored to have his assistance with team affairs. Don't you agree?"</p>
<p>"Yes, with people like you in the air force to serve as cadres, the future of this air force unit is promising." I didn't say what I wanted to say. Words are superfluous when it comes to facts.</p>

<h3>Reader Replies: Medicine and Hygiene</h3>
<p>(1) Cao Niande asks: My daughter is three years old, born in August two years ago. She has a blister on the back of her head, sometimes hard, sometimes soft (mostly harder when she cries than usual), that doesn't hurt or itch. It was there from birth, but initially, it was as small as a yellow bean. Since then, it has gradually grown, and it is now the size of a copper coin. I would like to ask: (1) How should this blister be treated? Are there any effective oral or topical medications? (2) If surgery is required, since there are no reliable hospitals in my area, and the child is too young, I plan to wait until she is an adult to have surgery. Is this acceptable?</p>
<p>Also, I have coughed up blood several times and suffer from lung disease. I would like to ask: (1) How should it be treated? If I come to Shanghai for treatment, which hospital is recommended? (2) What is the estimated cost of all medical expenses? Please advise!</p>
<p>[Reply by Dr. Tang Renjin]: (1) The contents of the blister must be examined to determine the treatment plan. Oral or topical medications are ineffective. (2) If it progresses slowly, then wait until adulthood to have surgery. (Re:) (1) An X-ray of the lungs is required to determine the treatment plan. If you come to Shanghai, you can go to the Second or Fourth Municipal Hospital. (2) A third-class hospital room costs approximately 1,500 yuan per day.</p>
<p>(2) A letter from Yide (One Virtue) announces an effective remedy for athlete's foot. I have suffered from athlete's foot for years. Recently, due to effective prevention, I have not had any outbreaks, even though the weather has been hot. The method is to wash the feet daily with potassium permanganate solution (the water in the basin should be slightly pink, not too concentrated). Socks should be changed frequently, preferably daily. Athlete's foot is a type of eczema bacteria. Regularly washing the feet with potassium permanganate can kill the bacteria. Without eczema bacteria, athlete's foot will heal naturally. Wearing fewer leather shoes is even better.</p>
<p>[Reply by Dr. Tang Renjin]: Athlete's foot is a type of filamentous fungus. Washing the feet with potassium permanganate solution has a sterilizing effect. Socks should be changed frequently, and wearing fewer leather shoes provides both cleanliness and ventilation. The method is excellent. If it is not effective, you may want to try Fungs or Dermyko.</p>
<p>(3) Wu Ren asks: I am a man in my forties and have suffered from a small bowel hernia for five months. Is there any other effective remedy besides surgery to cure it permanently? I would be grateful for your answer.</p>
<p>[Reply by Dr. Tang Renjin]: An inguinal hernia, commonly known as a small bowel hernia, has no permanent cure other than surgery.</p>
<h3>Xin Fu Chinese Medicine Store Donates 10,000 Prescriptions</h3>
<p>Must be verified by this column or a local physician.</p>
<p>To the Editor: I previously read in your newspaper about Director Zhang Xixian of Fengxiang County, Shaanxi Province, who specializes in an effective prescription for lung disease, which was certified by Dr. Chen Cunren. I followed the prescription and provided it to sick relatives and friends, and it proved effective. The number of Chinese people suffering from lung disease is alarming. The general working class, when they contract this disease, not only cannot afford medicine but also cannot afford medical treatment. Feeling this strongly, I am willing to prepare 10,000 doses of the original prescription in the original proportions to help the poor and sick. Starting immediately, at the entrance of our store at No. 14, Qujiang Lane, No. 522 Hankou Road, we will give ten doses to each patient upon presentation of a written certificate from the patient's local doctor, Dr. Chen Cunren, or this column. If anyone does not wish to receive the donation, we will collect 1,000 yuan per dose to continue to donate more. I am aware that this is just a drop in the bucket, but I hope that other businesses will follow suit. If charitable women are willing to donate, I am willing to assist. In this way, not only will the patients benefit, but also the future of Chinese medicine will be promoted. Respectfully, I wish you peace. Xin Fu Yong Ji Pharmacy, Ren Xia, respectfully.</p>
<h3>Poor Children's Handicraft Institute Recruiting Orphans</h3>
<p>Apply to this column first for registration</p>
<p>The Shanghai Poor Children's Handicraft Institute, located in Xiaonanmen, is well-managed and has achieved remarkable results. This summer, twelve graduates of the senior class have already been hired as apprentices by the industrial and commercial sectors. The institute currently has more than eighty students and plans to recruit twelve new students to fill vacancies. Any orphaned and helpless children over the age of twelve can be recommended by legitimate businesses. First, apply to this column for registration. Once qualified, they can prepare the necessary procedures to enter the institute to learn a craft. In addition, the institute's monthly expenses are very high, relying entirely on donations from enthusiastic individuals and monthly contributions from the board of directors, which is still insufficient. We hope that social dignitaries will donate at any time, whether it be goods or cash. The office is located opposite the Baxianqiao Post Office, at the Dahua Real Estate Company. Telephone: 82686.</p>
<h3>Social Affairs Department Adds Shanghai East Registration Station</h3>

It began operations on the 16th of this month. The station is located next to the 20th District Office and has clean and simple facilities. The entrance has slogans such as "Finding jobs for people," "Finding people for jobs," "Job seekers get jobs," and "Those with jobs enjoy their work." The staff inside are especially sincere and amiable. From now on, job seekers and employers in the Yangshupu District will find it more convenient.</p>

<h3>The Secret of Ship Registration</h3>
<p>To the Editor:</p>
<p>Across from us, there is a branch of the ship registration office. All civilian ships must register, but each registration generates an income that is one or two times greater than the state treasury revenue. Most of those registering are illiterate farmers. Therefore, they pay 1,500 to 2,000 yuan, but the certificate clearly states that it is only 500 yuan. Doesn't all of this 1,500 yuan or so go straight into their pockets?</p>
<p>Chinese farmers are currently on the verge of bankruptcy. We should not allow these simple people to be subjected to invisible exploitation outside the law. Therefore, I dare to appeal to the shipping authorities about the facts I have witnessed, to quickly eliminate this harmful practice. (Qu Xianghuan, a reader from Kunshan)</p>
<h3>The Admirable Ticket Seller</h3>
<p>Some time ago, I took the municipal ferry from Pudong to Shanghai on business and, in a hurry, forgot a small bag near the ticket office. Because it contained important documents and cash, I was very anxious. I immediately returned to the original location in Pudong to inquire. When I asked the ticket seller, Mr. Chen, he kindly retrieved and kept it for me, returning it intact. Mr. Chen firmly refused to reveal his real name, and he refused to accept my gratitude of 10,000 yuan. Therefore, I ask your newspaper to publish this to commend his virtue and express my gratitude. Truly, we should admire ticket sellers like Mr. Chen. (Zhou Dagang, a soldier from Shanghai)</p>
<h3>Do You Really Want Gold Bars?</h3>
<p>Editor: In the spring of the 26th year (1937), Mr. Cai rented the downstairs room of my friend's house on Maoming Road (Moulmein Road) without any extra fees. After the August 13th Incident and up to today, Mr. Cai has become wealthy through his hardware business. He recently bought a house in Shideli, Maigen Road, with six bars of pure gold. However, he is not properly terminating the lease on my friend's room. Instead, he is demanding that my friend give him one and a half bars of gold to move out. Mr. Cai moved to Maigen Road on June 5th but has locked the room, threatening to pile up goods in it. My friend is truly unable to cope with such unreasonable behavior. My friend is a poor teacher with many children and wants to take back the room for his own use. What effective methods can he use to recover the room from such an unreasonable tenant? In this world of gold bars, this person is too much, bullying people too much. I hope the government will provide a fair judgment! (Fang Xingwu, respectfully)</p>

<h3>Returning to the Old Home (Novel)</h3>
<p>— You Chi Zhao</p>
<p>The first winter after the victory, the midday air raid siren had sounded, and crowds poured out of the buildings. The north wind blowing from the Bund was particularly fierce, stinging people's faces. Zhang Ziliang had just walked out of the × stock company. He felt warm all over, full of triumph, thinking, thinking about that most exciting moment.</p>
<p>"Piggy!" An untidily dressed stranger bumped right into him, making him angrily curse. He hurriedly patted his newly made black velvet overcoat and glanced at the person.</p>
<p>Seeing his imposing manner, the man kept silent and walked forward. "Old Zhang," another person greeted him, drawn by the sound of "Piggy," "Oh, Old Wang." Ziliang shook hands with the man and sized him up. "Long time no see, how are you?" Old Wang was also looking over Ziliang from head to toe. "So-so, just getting by, have you had lunch? Let's talk," Ziliang said smugly, wanting to show off to his old friend. Before Old Wang could speak, he shouted shrilly, "Rickshaw! Rickshaw!"</p>
<p>The rickshaw driver expertly sped over. He pulled Old Wang onto the rickshaw and pointed forward. "Fine Dining Restaurant." As he said this, he took out two cigars, handed one to Old Wang, and lit them. "Ah!" He sighed as if taking a deep breath.</p>
<p>Old Wang smoked his cigar, seemingly lost in thought. They were silent for a while.</p>
<p>"Hello!" Two American soldiers also riding in rickshaws urged their drivers to go faster, passing by their rickshaw and playfully greeting them.</p>
<p>"Piggy, top-notch!" Ziliang responded as if he had gained an advantage, laughing heartily, which made Old Wang smile slightly.</p>
<p>Arriving at the Fine Dining Restaurant, Ziliang tossed a U.S. dollar to the rickshaw driver without looking back and pulled Old Wang inside.</p>
<p>The waiter greeted them and asked what they would like to eat.</p>
<p>"Treating a guest, you think I'd eat your special meal? Just pick a few good side dishes, and make it quick!" Ziliang said as if blaming the waiter for being clueless, and glanced at him.</p>
<p>"Old Zhang, where did you come from just now?" Old Wang asked, taking a puff of his cigar.</p>
<p>"×× Stock Company," Ziliang's voice seemed to get louder as he threw the cigarette into a small jar.</p>
<p>"Do you work there?"</p>
<p>"No, just playing around there."</p>
<p>This made Old Wang silent. He remembered that Ziliang and he had been colleagues in the puppet government. After the victory, they were both dismissed. They were both originally poor clerks. How could he have become wealthy in just two months, and where did he get the capital to play the stock market?</p>
<p>"Then, where do you work?" Old Wang couldn't help but ask.</p>
<p>"×× Department's × Office," Ziliang said, tilting his head back and blowing smoke.</p>
<p>"Then, you…"</p>
<p>"I do field work in the office," Ziliang said, interrupting as if he already understood Old Wang's question. "We field workers sign in at the office in the morning and can go on business trips at any time. You know, field work is much better than being a section chief or director sitting in the office, more freedom, and…" Ziliang stuttered at the end, only making a face at Old Wang.</p>
<p>"You're really capable!" Old Wang smiled knowingly, also seeming envious.</p>
<p>"No wonder you have the time and money to go to the stock company."</p>
<p>"In this world, you have to be good at getting ahead. If you don't, how can you stand out? I've become what I am now because of this," Ziliang said, looking at his watch, and continued, "Old Wang, have you found a job yet?"</p>
<p>Old Wang answered with a wry smile. Ziliang also smiled knowingly.</p>
<p>"I think you're just too honest. In these times, how can honest people make a living?" Ziliang said with emotion.</p>
<p>Old Wang looked embarrassed and only sighed.</p>
<p>After the meal, they parted ways. Zhang Ziliang walked to the ×× Department's × Office. Because the stock market was closed in the afternoon, there wasn't much official business that day. He and his colleagues chatted about money, stocks, dance halls, and women, but never mentioned state affairs.</p>
<p>After work, Zhang Ziliang hitched his left foot and, with a cigar in his mouth, rode a car home. His wife had just finished her twelfth round of mahjong.</p>
<p>"Today, how was the market today?" his wife asked eagerly.</p>
<p>"Not like the curves on your body, but a straight line upwards." Ziliang blew a puff of smoke and laughed heartily. "And you, how were your battles?"</p>
<p>"Shut your mouth." His wife raised her hand, the gold ring and diamond ring on her left hand flashing, the dragon and phoenix bracelets dazzling. "You have to compensate me for my losses, I lost almost ten thousand today!"</p>
<p>"What's that? If the stock goes up by one yuan, it's enough for you to lose for a year!" He took the opportunity to put his arm around his wife. Outside, the north wind was still blowing, but their room was warm.</p>
<p>In the evening, Zhang Ziliang told his wife that everyone was optimistic about the stock market in the next two days, and that the price of gold was not rising or falling because the Bank of China was selling it. He wanted to exchange all the gold for stocks, and also exchange his wife's jewelry to increase his strength.</p>
<p>"You see, it went up by 30% today, and if it goes up by another 30% tomorrow, the day after tomorrow… my fortune will be over ten million. When the time comes to sell, we'll go back to our hometown, saving us the trouble of being servile and sucking up to people, watching their faces." Zhang Ziliang gave his wife a definitive conclusion.</p>
<p>His wife also thought it was right. She was even more convinced that her husband was "in the pink" and "invincible." After the victory, he found that way, earning a few gold bars by connecting and collecting. Then he got the idea to buy stocks, and he "won the first battle." He looked even more presentable. If he came up with such a trick again, like cholera bacteria in the human body, multiplying two, two into four, returning to his hometown would make him a wealthy man, buying fields and land, ordering servants around, and having a lifetime of endless fun. Thinking of this, she couldn't help but get excited, swallowing her saliva, and feeling comfortable in her limbs.</p>
<p>The next day, Zhang Ziliang rushed to the office to sign in, then applied for a business trip. He exchanged his jewelry and sold his gold to buy more than 10,000 shares of ×× stock, which was the hottest of the three hot stocks.</p>
<p>The stock was rising, and he watched the report board, sucking wildly on his cigar. The staff member standing by the telephone raised his voice to report the market conditions, and the writers quickly wrote on the board, "35, 40…" Ziliang watched and listened. His face was full of a satisfied smile, and his heart was also beating. The sound of laughter from time to time made him feel like he had gained sympathy. He nodded to acquaintances from time to time, exchanging knowing glances and smiles. He looked at his watch, and it was only a little after ten o'clock. If this continued, wouldn't it rise another 30% by the time the market closed at ten o'clock?</p>
<p>"45, 50…" the reporter was saying, the clerk was writing.</p>
<p>"Five thousand shares, two thousand shares, one thousand shares…" the sounds of transactions were swirling.</p>
<p>"Up again, up, up, up, today there's going to be another record high." People were discussing.</p>
<p>At eleven o'clock, the phone seemed to stop, and the reporter and writer finally had a chance to rest. People talked even more. They were all optimistic that there would be even more record highs tomorrow.</p>
<p>"How's the market?" the person in charge of the telephone asked the other party, as if unable to bear the silence.</p>
<p>"Ah! Something's wrong, the market is slowing down, what's the reason?…" People were all listening.</p>
<p>"35, 40…" Ziliang's heart also beat with the sound waves.</p>
<p>"30, 35…" Ziliang was wildly sucking on his cigar.</p>
<p>"Oh, falling!" After a commotion, it fell silent.</p>
<p>"25, 30…" The cigar was almost finished, burning his hand. Ziliang threw it away and lit another one.</p>
<p>The market closed, and Ziliang went home for lunch. His wife asked him, but he just shook his head.</p>
<p>"I knew something bad was going to happen when you came home for lunch," his wife said quietly.</p>
<p>"The market was still rising when it opened, but it changed at eleven o'clock. I don't know what happened. We're just small fry. Are the big fish eating the small fish again?" Ziliang said worriedly.</p>
<p>"I thought gold was better after all, and practical. Stocks are ultimately empty," his wife said regretfully.</p>
<p>Ziliang did not answer. They spent a lonely afternoon and evening.</p>
<p>Early the next morning, Ziliang rushed to open the newspaper. He saw the joint announcement from the ×× Bureau and the ×× Department banning the trading of stocks. A shadow fell on his heart, heavy as if pressed down by a stone.</p>
<p>He didn't eat breakfast and went out the door. The biting north wind blew, making him shiver. The sky was also gloomy, as if it was going to rain. He went to the × stock company to inquire about news.</p>
<p>"Mr. Zhang, have you read the newspaper? Stock trading is suspended today!" The company staff member told him, shaking his head.</p>
<p>"Um," Ziliang felt hot all over. "Is there a market?" He still had hope, but his voice trembled a little.</p>
<p>"The market is a black market, being shouted in the corridors, but trading is difficult. In this kind of atmosphere, who would still buy ×× shares? The asking price is only '12, 14.'"</p>
<p>"When, when will it reopen?" Ziliang's forehead was sweating.</p>
<p>"Heaven knows!" The staff member shrugged and shook his head.</p>
<p>Zhang Ziliang walked out of the ×× stock company, thinking with his head down, Isn't it over? All his assets are there. If there is no date to resume trading, everything will be frozen… He wondered where he was going.</p>
<p>"Piggy!" As he unconsciously walked into the middle of the road, a trolley bus happened to drive by. The driver quickly braked to avoid the danger, and couldn't help but swear angrily.</p>
<p>Zhang Ziliang was stunned and glared at the driver. Just as he was about to walk back to the sidewalk, a high-speed six-wheeled "express car" drove towards him. Ziliang was knocked to the ground. People gathered around to watch in the cold wind, but Zhang Ziliang had already returned to his old home!</p>

<h3>Flying Together, Staying Together – 94</h3>
<p>— Zhao Qing Ge</p>
<p>These were all things that Lihua could not understand! She gave Dong Shaoling a special kind of feeling with all her innocence; she was quietly and secretly infatuated with a soul; she wanted to possess this soul for herself; but all these things were what Dong Shaoling could not have guessed, could not have been conscious of. Between them, both tangibly and intangibly, there was a vast distance. This distance was not something human effort could overcome; this distance caused them to diverge into two different realms; this distance created an eternal, irreparable, and inexplicable regret!</p>
<p>Only Liu Ziyun could see this situation clearly, but she found it inconvenient to pierce through their vague emotions and did not want Lihua’s pure and fragile heart to experience even more sorrow! Because Liu Ziyun’s feelings for Lihua were singular. She had almost donated all her emotions, willing to sacrifice everything for Lihua’s happiness, to be a loyal protector for life. In other words, Liu Ziyun was an extremely mechanical and stubborn expert in mathematical physics; one who had to concentrate her feelings on a single object to be satisfied! When she had once given all her feelings to a person, could even say entrusted them to a person; and this person—(her husband)—then returned all her emotions, she was simply driven mad by the pain! For this reason, she vowed: she would find another object to "give" to. She hoped that this object would be a child, even if it was a dog! She would be willing; but she could never give herself to a man again; a man who was fickle, treacherous, fond of the new, and tired of the old. Therefore, she would not marry again; she had been single for five years, she regarded marriage as a fearsome road! Now, her outstanding case was resolved, and she was glad to have finally found an object to which she could unconditionally give all her emotions, and this object was in need of her emotions. And so, she was happy, contentedly happy!</p>
<p>Kaifeng also had remnants of warlords, so the flames of the Northern Expedition spread to Kaifeng, which meant that Lihua had to follow Madam and Zhang Xian on their third wandering journey. The destination of the wandering was Wuhan, so they were preparing to proceed towards this new goal.</p>
<h3>Benevolence and Love</h3>
<p>— Xie Beicheng</p>
<p>In a very good elementary school civics textbook, I read the following sentences:</p>
<p>"I protect animals that are beneficial to mankind."</p>
<p>"I love the compatriots of my country."</p>
<p>Below these two sentences were parentheses, with the words "Benevolence and Love" annotated inside, which means to explain the meaning of "Benevolence and Love" to the children so that they can practice being good citizens.</p>
<p>I have no objection to the people who wrote the book. I said earlier that this is a good book, but I thought of another thing. Because here I discovered that "Benevolence and Love" also has its limits. Times have progressed, and the scope of "Benevolence and Love" has gradually narrowed.</p>
<p>Buddhism speaks of cause and effect, which is to persuade people to resolve hatred; Buddhism forbids killing, which is to say that life is lovely. Underneath Shakyamuni's golden lotus flower, there are many poisonous snakes and beasts. In the Western Paradise, there is neither you nor me. This kind of broad love is not just for "animals that are beneficial to mankind." Jesus admonished people: "Love your enemies." We grow up in this world and gradually learn to be clever. We seem to be cultivating hatred, not only making it take root in our hearts, but also trying to pass this hatred on to our descendants. But Jesus was nailed to the cross, his eyes looking at those lawyers, Hebrews, tax collectors, and those hypocrites, and said, "Father, forgive their sins!"</p>
<p>The teachings of Buddha and the doctrines of Jesus were eventually accepted and have been passed down for more than a thousand years. They also speak of benevolence and love, but it is different from ours. Is it that the years have tormented people too much?</p>
<p>I don't know how the teachers sitting on the podium explain those two sentences in the book. Do they also explain the opposite meaning to the children?</p>
<p>"Do not love animals that are not beneficial to people."</p>
<p>"I do not love foreigners!"</p>
<p>In this era when the United Nations is being sought, it may not be very appropriate. I was silent in the study and finally realized the cleverness of the author, because he lived in a world where foreigners were rampant. This pain was only recently wiped away. The place where he lived was still habitually called a concession. Therefore:</p>
<p>"I love the compatriots of my country!"</p>
<p>Implicitly containing hatred for those who are not of my race. Who do we say is right? Who is wrong? For example, in 1946, DDT insecticide is very popular. Monks are made of flesh and fear insect bites, so DDT is also sprayed in the meditation hall, while they are still chanting "I Buddha's compassion!"</p>
<p>To put it more simply, in this world war, didn't Jesus's followers also carry guns and go to the front line? Not only did they not love their enemies, but their hatred was probably even deeper than others! This kind of love is planted on hatred.</p>
<p>I don't hope that people will talk about benevolence and love, but plant love on hatred:</p>
<p>"I hate animals that are beneficial to mankind."</p>
<p>"I hate the compatriots of my country."</p>
<p>We have not experienced this kind of life. Isn't it said that there are still bacterial weapons being invented?</p>
<p>I only hope that mankind has learned to be clever and more practical. Children are pure, let's not deceive them!</p>
<h3>Daughter of a Peasant (Selected World Famous Paintings)</h3>
<p>— by Ohlson</p>
<h3>International Knowledge and Peace Conference</h3>
<p>Soviet Concessions Lead to Regularly Scheduled Conference</p>
<p>Special Compilation by this Newspaper's Translation Department South</p>
<p>The convening of a peace conference and the signing of peace treaties mark the formal end of war, so everyone hopes for their swift arrival.</p>
<p>Due to the immense scope and complexity of the Second World War, its conclusion requires three peace conferences: one for Italy, Bulgaria, Romania, Hungary, and Finland; one for Germany; and one for Japan. Only after all three peace conferences have been successfully completed and the peace treaties have been formally signed will the world return to its original state and gain a new look.</p>
<p>The twenty-one-nation peace conference scheduled to be held in Paris on the 29th of this month is specifically to discuss the peace treaties with Italy, Bulgaria, Romania, Hungary, and Finland. In other words, it is the first of the three peace conferences. However, before the decision to convene this peace conference, countless arguments had already taken place, with many twists and turns, displaying the utmost in changeability. Now, let's briefly describe what happened.</p>
<p>Discussions on the peace treaties with Italy, Bulgaria, Romania, Hungary, and Finland began at the first Foreign Ministers Conference held in London in September 1945, but they reached a stalemate due to difficulties over procedural issues. At that time, agreement was reached on certain aspects of the peace treaty with Italy, and concrete progress was made in the preparatory work for the peace treaties with Finland and Romania and Bulgaria. The main obstacle to the conference was whether the drafting of the peace treaties should be limited to the countries that signed the surrender documents. To break this deadlock, the foreign ministers of the three major powers met again in Moscow in December 1945. As a result, it was decided that only member groups who had signed the surrender documents could participate in drafting the peace treaties with the five countries. In other words, the peace treaty with Italy was drafted by Britain, the United States, the Soviet Union, and France; the peace treaties with Romania, Bulgaria, and Hungary were drafted by Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union; and the peace treaty with Finland was drafted by Britain and the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Based on the decision of the Moscow Foreign Ministers Conference, the representatives of the four foreign ministers in London were ordered to separately draft the peace treaties with the five countries. As soon as the draft peace treaties were ready, a peace conference would be held by the five member groups of the Foreign Ministers Conference and sixteen countries in the United Nations that had made practical contributions to the military resistance against European enemy countries for final discussion. At one point, the peace conference was scheduled to be held on May 1 this year.</p>
<p>However, the representatives of the four foreign ministers encountered many difficulties in drafting the peace treaties. The obstacles were so numerous that it seemed as if they had already entered a dead end. The peace conference scheduled to be held on May 1 had to be postponed. At this critical moment, U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes advocated holding another four-nation Foreign Ministers Conference in Paris. The complexity of the problem and the importance of the relations required the foreign ministers of the four countries to personally step in. As a result, Britain, the Soviet Union, and France all expressed their support, and the conference was convened on April 25. During the conference, the four foreign ministers reviewed the difficulties encountered in drafting the peace treaties one by one. As a result of the negotiations, some minor issues were agreed upon, but the major issues remained unresolved, and the parties were at a stalemate. In particular, opinions differed greatly on the issue of Trieste and its hinterland, the issue of Italian colonies, and the issue of navigation on the Danube, and the situation almost reached an irreversible point. At that time, a pessimistic atmosphere pervaded the globe.</p>
<p>The foreign ministers of the four powers argued fiercely in the meeting room, but outside the room, they were "good friends" and were very cordial.</p>
<p>Darkness Reveals Light</p>
<p>Fortunately, a ray of light suddenly appeared in the darkness: the Paris Foreign Ministers Conference did not declare failure, but decided to postpone it and reconvene it a month later. Counting on this turning point, the four foreign ministers finally gathered again in Paris on June 15.</p>
<p>Judging from the problems faced by the Four Foreign Ministers Conference, they were indeed intricate and complex. Each country, for its own benefit, had to fight each other and was unwilling to concede. However, the world is, after all, a world that has suffered from war. Prolonged chaos leads to a desire for order, which is not only the mentality of the general public but also the wish of the foreign ministers representing the people of various countries. Therefore, in this Paris Foreign Ministers Conference, all parties tried their best to find compromise solutions and finally reached compromise solutions on the previously unresolved important issues. For example, a compromise boundary line was drawn for the Italian southern border, and Trieste was placed under international co-management; the issue of Italian colonies adopted a avoid the important and dwell on the trivial approach and was postponed for resolution until a year later, only the statement in the peace treaty with Italy that Italy abandoned its colonial claims was needed; on the point of Danube navigation, the four countries had recognized that, for the benefit of world peace and world trade, it was necessary to freely open the Danube and its navigable tributaries and canals under conditions of complete equality for all countries. Other issues, such as the issue of Italian reparations, the issue of the disposal of the remaining Italian fleet, and the issue of the withdrawal of British and American troops from Italy and Soviet troops from Bulgaria, have all been agreed upon, so preparing the draft peace treaty is no longer very difficult. The long-awaited twenty-one-nation peace conference was finally decided to open grandly on July 29.</p>
<p>Invitation Issues, Soviet Concessions</p>
<p>However, before the decision was made to convene the peace conference and issue invitations, there were still considerable twists and turns: one was the issue of inviting countries, and the other was the issue of the peace conference's procedures. Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov insisted that China should not be one of the inviting countries of the peace conference but could only be an invited country. U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes sternly rebuked him on the spot, believing that this was a completely wrong and unnecessary move, tantamount to insulting China. Our Foreign Minister Wang also made a solemn statement, believing that this move violated the Moscow Agreement. Finally, under pressure from the public opinion of various countries, the Soviet Union abandoned its attitude and accepted the method of the peace conference chairman being rotated by the foreign ministers of China, Britain, the United States, the Soviet Union, and France, and the peace conference being convened in the name of the entire Foreign Ministers Conference. As for the issue of procedures, there was also some dispute. Molotov insisted that the procedures of the peace conference should be decided by the four powers and sent out with the invitations, but British Foreign Secretary Bevin and U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes resolutely stated that the issue of the procedures of the peace conference should be decided by the entire twenty-one-nation conference. Finally, a compromise solution was adopted: the Foreign Ministers Conference decided on a few principles as suggestions and sent them to the participating countries for adoption.</p>
<p>After so many twists and turns, the twenty-one-nation peace conference was finally decided to be held in Paris on the 29th of this month. Peace-loving people all over the world can wait and see.</p>
<p>Before the opening of the peace conference, peace-loving people naturally hope that its work will proceed smoothly and reap fruitful results, and that the peace conferences with Germany and Japan can also be convened as soon as possible, so that the world can quickly return to its original state and move towards the path of postwar peace and prosperity.</p>
<p>World News</p>
<p>Paris, because of the housing shortage, the government authorities have recently stipulated that each person shall not live in more than one bedroom, one living room, and one dining room, with the kitchen being outside. For families with several members, this proportion is extrapolated. "Surplus houses must be rented out!"</p>
<p>The most difficult railway to build in the world is a section of the Peruvian Central Railway. This section of railway is only 138 miles long, but it took twelve years to build. The road starts at sea level and winds its way over a plateau 15,000 feet above sea level. A total of 65 tunnels and 67 bridges were built. Due to the difficulty of the project, 11,000 of the 13,000 road workers died in accidents.</p>
<p>The most modern fabric in the world turns red when red light shines on it, green when green light shines on it, and a blue when blue light shines on it. This is made of glass-like (plastic) fibers, which can turn into various colors due to the different curvatures of the radiation surface. This fabric also has a great advantage: it does not need to be washed, just wipe it with a wet towel and it is clean again.</p>
<p>Housewives often find it a headache that matches, if accidentally placed in a relatively humid place, will soon not light. But now, this is no longer a problem. A waterproof match is already on sale in the market. This match is first immersed in six kinds of glue solutions, and after drying, it is coated with a very thin transparent film. You can soak this match in water for 24 hours, and it can still be used the same way when you take it out.</p>
<p>Mysterious Hungary - Million Dollar Bills Used to Light Cigarettes, Legislators' Annual Salary Only Enough to Buy a Pound of Sugar, By Mo</p>
<p>To an American soldier, Budapest, the capital of Hungary, is truly a baffling place. In a luxurious hotel, a bottle of the finest champagne costs only forty-five cents. In the large companies on Váci Street, you can buy silk stockings, ivory, or valuable porcelain with just a few odd bills. A sergeant's meager salary is enough to buy the deed to an office or apartment. But to a Hungarian himself, this place is equally baffling. A member of parliament's annual salary of 650,000 pengős (Hungarian currency) is barely enough to buy a pound of sugar. A two-story apartment with a basement has a monthly rent limit of 20,000 pengős, which is just enough for the landlord to take a single tram ride.</p>
<p>Last week, the pengő, which had already soared to an alarming astronomical figure, continued to rise. In 1939, one pengő was worth 29.12 U.S. cents. Last month, one U.S. dollar was only worth 1,000,000,000,000,000 pengős, but by July 3, it had risen to 800,000,000,000,000,000 pengős. Last month, Hungarians were still talking about "million pengő bills" and "ten million pengő bills," but last week they could only say "ten thousand million pengő bills." Now, it is impossible to say, so they have to use "brown bills" (i.e., 100,000,000,000,000 pengő bills) and "blue bills" (i.e., 1,100,000,000,000,000 pengő bills) to represent them. This situation is a thousand times worse than the German mark in 1923, and the Hungarian government's price control policy has long since completely collapsed.</p>
<p>The government's policy originally only hoped that the prices of daily necessities could remain stable within a day. Wages were calculated daily. But unfortunately, prices rose hourly. The situation is completely hopeless, because there is no hope of foreign aid, and Hungary itself has been ravaged by war and has no way to stabilize the economy. Now, on the streets of Budapest, no one would bother to bend down and pick up a million pengő bill that fell on the ground, because the only use for a million pengő bill is probably to light a cigarette. Using a million-dollar bill to light a cigarette, how extravagant are the Hungarians, China sighs in inferiority.</p>

<p>Free Talk</p>
<p>Please Pay Attention, Post Office By Shao Fu</p>
<p>Today, we are publishing this long letter at the expense of space for two reasons: first, we have always praised the personnel system of the post office and hope to draw the attention of the authorities to thoroughly investigate this matter, because we will never regard it as a personal problem of Mr. Zhang Yourong; second, using people only for their virtue and ability, rewarding merits and punishing demerits, being impartial, not favoring those one likes, not disliking those one dislikes, promotions and demotions, births, old age, sickness, and death must be governed by law. An organization, a career, can be like this, this organization must be sound, this career must prosper, otherwise, it will increase social chaos, and the rampant flow of selfish desires. People who often say that people's hearts are not as good as they used to be, cannot say that this has nothing to do with it.</p>
<p>Free Talk is the readers' garden. Even a small matter is a social problem, and we will never ignore it and let it go easily; however, in order to suit various interests, we do not intend to use this method to discuss problems and publish all incoming letters.</p>
<p>The following is the original letter from Mr. Zhang Yourong:</p>
<p>Morning reading your publication: "A Letter" is an appeal from four gentlemen of the Business Bureau of the Central Bank against the unreasonable transfer by the authorities.</p>
<p>The gentleman is very sympathetic, but the letter lacks concrete facts, so it is not convenient to publish it.</p>
<p>The gentleman said again: "An organization or a group's personnel administration has its own regulations, and if necessary, and reasonable and legal, it has the right to make any disposal." Sir! You are very right, the following paragraph of facts is to serve as an echo of the appeal of the four gentlemen.</p>
<p>My deceased son served in the Wuhu First-Class Post Office as a postal assistant, 26 years old this year. He entered the post office at the age of 20 and was ordered to be sent to Wuhu. The hardship of postal life in the occupied area is not comparable to that of civil servants in the rear, and he finally survived for more than five long years. On September 17 last year, he asked for leave to return to Shanghai, and then became ill and stayed in Shanghai. He immediately submitted an application for sick leave to the personnel section of the Shanghai Management Bureau, twice in succession, each time for 20 days, and it was repeatedly certified by the bureau's doctor and approved by the assistant. The initial approval period seemed to be from October 11, 34, for 20 days, and later the Wuhu Post Office sent a letter correcting it to October 7, 34, due to the distinction between personal leave and sick leave. Continued leave was from October 27, 34, for a total of 40 days in two times. Because my son still had four days of personal leave according to postal regulations, he went to Wuhu on November 20 to cancel his leave. How could he know that on the fourth day, the director handed him an order from the Anhui Management Bureau: "To be handled as retirement due to illness from October 12."</p>
<p>My son has served in the Wuhu Post Office for more than five years, and there should be detailed records of his past sick leave. The initial sick leave certificate issued by the Shanghai Bureau was sent to Wuhu on October 16. Later, the date was corrected in the letter. Then, the Wuhu Post Office issued an instruction on October 24: "To find another unlimited guarantee." He immediately complied and sent the certificate to Wuhu. The continued leave certificate was sent on October 30. After that, the Wuhu Post Office did not give any reply or instruction. According to this, my son's sick leave should have been approved without a doubt. Because he was loyal to his duties, he did not take much rest and rushed to Wuhu to report for duty. How could he know that the Anhui Management Bureau had already handled his retirement due to illness at an early date.</p>
<p>Retirement due to illness is a matter of handling whether others have a job or not. If the post office made a prior or due date notice, my son would never have left Shanghai to go there, but the post office actually issued an order more than forty days after the expiration date. Its impact on my sick son is truly unbearable to recall.</p>
<p>At that time, my son felt that his health was still good, and the Wuhu Post Office was in urgent need of manpower, so he immediately submitted a request to the Anhui Management Bureau to allow him to resume his post in the original bureau. How could he know that the resumption of duty was only approved in March of this year, and he was transferred to the Hefei Post Office and received 50,000 yuan in travel expenses.</p>
<p>After more than four months of unemployment after the illness, my son's body could not support the stimulation. On March 24, he was admitted to the Yefan Mountain Hospital in Wuhu, hoping to recover soon and go to Hefei to resume his post. His expression of loyalty to his duties is still vivid in my memory. On April 4, the Wuhu Post Office instructed that he must go to Hefei to resume his post before April 15. On April 11, he was urged to leave with the same instruction and blamed him for staying in Wuhu. If he exceeded the deadline, he would not be allowed to resume his post. Therefore, on April 16, his condition became critical, and he finally died in the hospital on April 21.</p>
<p>Being able to resume his post but not giving him the resumption of duty, not being able to resume his post and forcing him to resume his duty, this is what the gentleman called: "Having the right to make any disposal." On June 27, I reported the above facts to the Shanghai Management Bureau, and later received its approval on July 2: "This matter belongs to the Anhui Management Bureau's jurisdiction and has been transferred to the bureau to request a thorough investigation of who abused their power and replied directly." To this day, I have not seen any reply.</p>
<p>More than three months have passed since my son died, and I have not seen any notice from the post office, nor have I had the insurance policy returned or any condolences. They treat my son's career and life as a child's play. The post office is an organization with a perfect personnel system, and it must be that my son's human relations are not yet complete, and this is the result he got.</p>
<p>Four gentlemen, the above facts are your reply, what do you think?</p>
<p>Zhang Yourong respectfully presents on 35, 7, 22.</p>
<p>Protest By Chen Lin</p>
<p>There was an article in the Free Talk on the 19th, "Nanjing Jeeps, Prohibited from Carrying Girls," which I read with regret!</p>
<p>Do women not even have the qualification to ride in Jeeps? According to the author of the article: "Because there are women, more gasoline will be used, and more wronged ghosts will be run over by the wheels." In fact, that may be the case, but can women be called "harbingers of disaster" for this reason? According to this, aren't men also "cauldrons of disaster"? The number of people run over by male drivers is countless! Furthermore, aren't most of the people riding in Jeeps for a joyride men, not just women? Why are all women not allowed to ride in Jeeps, while the family members of military agencies and friends of drivers, as long as they are male, can freely drive around in the streets? Is this saving gasoline?</p>
<p>I think this is insulting to women. I hope Chief of General Staff Chen will immediately withdraw his order. If you really want to save gasoline, you should prohibit everyone from riding in Jeeps for a joyride.</p>
<p>A Consistent Demand Re-征 By Xun Zheng</p>
<p>In the past two days, "Free Talk" has been talking about traffic problems continuously. These opinions, as Mr. Shao Fu said, "It represents the general opinion of the citizens."</p>
<p>Why is the tram order in Shanghai so bad? Here are just what I have seen with my own eyes:</p>
<p>The general situation is not very good. Except for Jing'an Temple and the Bund, where there are queues, the other small stations are a mess. When a tram comes, people swarm up and scramble to be the first, and as a result, people who want to get on cannot get on, and people who want to get off cannot get off, and everyone complains. Sometimes even the Bund will make an exception and not queue up, and people will squeeze onto the tram in a chaotic manner.</p>
<p>Also, the queue was originally well-ordered, but some special classes suddenly rush out of the queue and catch up head-on. If time is urgent, they will even climb in through the windows, and the passengers who have been waiting for a long time will be turned away.</p>
<p>On the tram, the only skill of these special people is not to buy tickets. The conductor does not even dare to ask. If they happen to ask them a question, they will show a stern face or even fly into a rage and resort to violence.</p>
<p>Secondly, it is common for trams not to stop at stations. Conversely, it is also common for trams to stop before reaching the station. But when people of special classes want to board the tram, no matter where they are, they just wave their hand, and as long as the driver sees them, he will immediately stop the tram and invite them to come up.</p>
<p>Shanghai's transportation is in a very difficult period, especially the tram. There are few cars and many passengers, and coupled with the lack of order, how can it be done well?</p>
<p>I hope that no matter who you are, you should know that: living today, if you do not know what order is, it is a shame! This is the unanimous demand of all 3.7 million citizens of Shanghai.</p>
<p>"If You Want to Get Promoted and Make a Fortune, Don't Take Another Road; If You Want to Engage in Private Business and Bribery, Try Entering This Door!"</p>
<p>A Few Things About Wu Yuan By Bai Lian</p>
<p>The gate of the Suzhou Enemy and Puppet Property Disposal Bureau is hung with the couplet: "If you want to get promoted and make a fortune, please take another road; if you want to engage in private business and bribery, do not enter this door!" But the more touching it is written, the more unspeakable the actions are. The case of the two section chiefs Yu and Huang of the bureau forcing a woman, Chang Dong'e, to death due to bribery has been delayed until today and has not been concluded. The court has announced that it will be publicly tried this month, and the people of Suzhou attach great importance to it. I am afraid that the trial will go on and on, and the trial will be fruitless. Someone jokingly changed the couplet to: "If you want to get promoted and make a fortune, don't take another road; if you want to engage in private business and bribery, try entering this door!" It is an extreme expression of ridicule and scolding!</p>
<p>Recently, Suzhou has strictly prohibited underground banks. Underground banks are loan sharking shops that secretly move cash in and out for high-interest exploitation. The interest rates of these underground banks are really scary; the highest is as high as 48% per month. Underground banks settle interest either every five days or every ten days, but most of them settle every ten days. People in the industry call "fen" "liang," such as ten liang, which is one "jiao." The police station summoned the persons in charge of all the underground banks in Suzhou to make a guarantee, but as a result, transactions are still being carried out in secret.</p>
<p>The number of underground banks that were summoned and strictly prohibited is as many as 700, which is really shocking. After being summoned, some of the persons in charge are members of the business community and are afraid that news reporters will take it as news and publish it, which will not look good on their faces. Therefore, several persons in charge who care about their reputation jointly allocated 10 million yuan to all the large and small newspapers in Suzhou, and there are also regulations: 2 million yuan for large newspapers and 1 million yuan for small newspapers. The size of the newspaper is determined by whether the newspaper is a broadsheet or an octavo. As a result, the newspapers that refused to sell their newspaper spirit were all of noble character and integrity, and fought for the newspaper business!</p>
<p>Also A Small Matter By Qi Zhi</p>
<p>In the past, because there was a distinction between the Public Concession and the French Concession, there was not much hindrance even though trams had the same route numbers but took different routes.</p>
<p>Now that the concessions have been recovered and Shanghai has been completely unified, the trams with the same route numbers still exist in the old two concessions, which is really inconvenient.</p>
<p>Residents can neither call them the "number X" of the "X Concession," nor can they conveniently say they are the "number X" of the old British or French Concessions, nor can they distinguish them by District 1 or District 8, which is really a headache!</p>
<p>It would be best to have a way to change the route numbers!</p>
<h3>Remembering Two Diplomats</h3>
<p>— Ping Qi</p>
<p>Last Saturday, the Shanghai cultural community held a tea party at the International Hotel to welcome Mr. Hu Shih back from his travels. At the tea party, both Mr. Hu and Mr. Yen Jun Lao delivered speeches with extremely beautiful diction. It was my great honor to attend such a grand occasion. However, I was also reminded of a Qinghua University anniversary celebration ten years ago, because the speakers invited to speak on that occasion were precisely the same two gentlemen who spoke last Saturday – Mr. Yen and Mr. Hu. Moreover, just like last Saturday's tea party, Mr. Yen was wearing a Western suit, and Mr. Hu was wearing a traditional Chinese gown. The vicissitudes of the world over these ten years have undergone countless changes! To hear these two gentlemen speak again now is truly deeply moving!</p>
<p>I remember in Mr. Yen's speech ten years ago, he mentioned the story of riding a small donkey out of Xizhimen to Qinghua Garden for work. At that time, Mr. Yen was the "Director-General" of "Qinghua Academy," which, in other words, was the position of the president of Qinghua University today. Mr. Hu Shih took the Qinghua scholarship examination to study in the United States during the time when Mr. Yen was in charge of school affairs.</p>
<p>Therefore, to use an old saying, Mr. Yen was indeed Mr. Hu's "teacher." Mr. Yen said at the tea party last Saturday, "When Mr. Shih came to Qinghua to take the examination to study abroad, I also happened to have a little connection with Qinghua." Although he used the utmost diplomatic and tactful language, his meaning was probably referring to this relationship.</p>
<p>When I was at Qinghua, out of curiosity, I looked up the exam papers from the year Mr. Hu took the examination to study abroad. In the year that Mr. Hu went abroad, the first person admitted was Mr. Zhao Yuanren, whose grades were so good that they could not be any better, with a total average of around 95 points. Mr. Hu did not seem very pleased, because it seemed that a total of six people went abroad that year, and Mr. Hu seemed to have ranked sixth, and the score did not seem to have reached 60 points – I don't know why, but I suddenly thought of another ambassador, Gu Shaochuan.</p>
<p>I have boundless admiration for Mr. Hu's morality and writings, but what I admire most about him is his wit and sense of humor. Therefore, I deeply believe that if he were to flip through "Free Talk" and see this little essay, he probably wouldn't be angry.</p>
