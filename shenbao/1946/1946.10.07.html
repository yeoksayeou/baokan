<p>〔本報南京六日電〕馬司兩使對於僵持中之和平商談，仍在作最後努力，今雖爲星期例假，馬司兩氏於十時四十分相偕訪謁主席，轉陳昨日王炳南向司徒大使提出之張家口停戰問題，並徴詢意見，三時，司徒大使約王炳南前往晤謁，聞係再對停戰問題有所研討，今晚據共產黨代表發言人稱，調人仍在盡最後努力，共產黨自亦不願局勢趨於破裂，惟共產黨認爲仍感遺憾者，對政府方面未對共產黨前提請張家口方面立即停戰之備忘錄，予以正式答覆前，此政府所發表之備忘錄，如能附及張家口一句，亦可藉以明瞭政府之眞意，至周恩來氏在滬，現正加緊起草規文，可能周將親携此項規文返京。又董必武十時曾往訪民盟　書長梁漱溟，對一般時局交換意見。</p>

<h3>徐州見聞</h3>
<p>— 本報九月廿五日徐州訊　特派員杭舟</p>
<p>蘇北戰事重心北移後，記者到達了徐州。徐州位當津浦，隴海兩路的交叉占，是歷史有上名的軍事重鎮，在抗戰中有過壯烈的徐州會戰，現在是綏靖公署的所在地。薛伯陵將軍在這兒統率了五十萬大軍，應付共軍的攻勢，並予以必要的打擊。</p>
<p>津浦路比京滬路寂莫得多。九月廿二日晚八時四十分開的特別快車中，頭等乘客寥寥無幾，二等車廂裏，一個人佔領一條長椅，舒服地躺十個鐘頭，天亮了，睜開眼睛，便是目的地。</p>
<p>風砂葡萄犁榴</p>
<p>在徐州，可看到北方的情調。風砂吻著大地。秋天，熟透了的葡萄，誘惑著人們的食欲，隴海路徐汴段通車後，碭山梨大批運來，五百元一個鮮甜可口。加上蕭縣來的石榴，這些，上海人食單中的珍品，這兒可以普遍地享受。</p>
<p>北方是樸素的。徐州的街頭難得看見艷裝女子。家庭婦女都是藍布旗袍，不湯髮，一雙布鞋。馬路相當寬，雖有風砂，絕少垃圾。房屋頗爲整齊。現在　靖公署辦公處，門口古色古香，進去則富麗堂皇，有各種現代設備。</p>
<p>徐州的一切可說表現了「軍事第一」。地方行政人員擱起其他工作，全付心力從事三件事：修路，編保甲；清鄉；此外，還有一樣是征兵，綏署轄區爲蘇魯皖三省全部及河南的一部，今年要征兵八萬餘名，已大致完成。「征兵發現什麼困難？」這問題，蘇省第九區行政專員馮子固的答覆，出我意料之外，他說：「反較抗戰時的困難爲少，尤其在新近的收復區，老百姓的財產被鬥爭完了，咬牙之餘，頗樂意當兵。」</p>
<p>綏署政治部主任滕傑告訴我另一件事：「徐州已沒有盜匪，小偷在肅清中，難民分別收容救濟了，所以亦沒有了乞丐。」乞丐，似乎少有遇到了，一位白髮蒼蒼老頭跟了我一段路，說著：「先生，我明天就回鄉了，要幾個盤緾錢！」</p>
<p>商場蕭條得很，只有銀錢業，旅館，飯店，澡堂子例外。</p>
<p>這是畸形的現象，大半是來往軍政人員和等候還鄉者造成的。這些人，住在旅館裏，有錢沒處用，就買些金戒子，金鐲子，金條子……。</p>
<p>將軍侃侃談話</p>
<p>薛伯陵將軍是這裏的首要人物。我到徐的當晚，薛氏招待了一次記者並發表了對當前局勢的意見。他先談起淮陰之戰，象東北的四平街戰役一樣，擊潰了蘇北共軍的主力，局面已經完全改觀，前途可無大戰，局勢有澄清把握。</p>
<p>淮陰是蘇北共軍的老巢，荷澤和濟寧，臨沂則是魯南共軍的主要根據地，除臨沂外，荷澤，濟寧，亦已爲軍收復，因此，魯南共軍都在動搖了。——他說時呈現著非常樂觀的意味。</p>
<p>「共軍好戰而不能戰」。他接著說：「他們在八年抗戰中未和日軍正式交戰過，運用的戰略，戰術都是陳舊的。」他打了個譬喻，「共軍像耗子，蚊子一般，如此而已。」</p>
<p>「凡是革命的政黨都是以民眾的福利爲前提的，而共產黨則是以民眾的福利破產爲前提。這樣的黨，不但不能算是革命的黨，而且連一個普通政黨的資格都失去了。」</p>
<p>「爲了人民，政府要救他們於水火之中！國軍收復一地，那裏的人民以狂熱的程度來歡迎國軍，這是可以向天下作證的：中國的民心究竟向著那邊！」</p>
<p>薛氏在政治上竭力推崇國父認爲古今中外的政治學說，沒有能超過三民主義的；在軍事上則竭力推崇孫子。薛氏對「孫子兵法」有著獨到的研究。招待會嚴肅地進行了二小時。薛氏的高級幕僚都參加這個招待會，但未發表意見。</p>
<p>徐州執行小組</p>
<p>在這個城市裏不調和地存在的是軍調部徐州執行小組和交通小組的共黨代表。他們一共有十二個人住在農民銀行後面的一幢半新的小洋房內，領隊的一位名王少庸，以前在山東共軍中服務。當上校，穿著一套土布軍服。我去訪問他們的時候，他們向我表示了他們的苦悶。但我去訪政府代表時，劉永芳中校則告訴了我他在共軍區域所見聞以及所身受的一切。兩方所談的距離是那麼遙遠！</p>
<p>共黨代表中有一位孫公飛先生，他曾任國軍中服務，抗戰開始，淞滬之戰，他落了伍，遇到共黨的部隊，就加入了共軍。這是很偶然的機會。末了他聲明他是老粗，不會說話。</p>
<p>王少庸上校則是一位極會說話的人，他說他一向在鄉村，到城市來不習慣，但他的言談顯示他是一個精明的人。對某些問題，他都用「有大清楚」，「尚未聽說」來答覆。</p>
<p>無論如何，人們的笑厭隨著軍事的演進在展開，流離失所的難民可以還鄉了。</p>
<p>社論</p>
<h3>宣慰荷印僑胞</h3>
<p>荷印宣慰使李迪俊氏，將於今日自京乘坐專機經香港飛往荷印，慰問僑胞。臨行，李氏向記者談此行任務，係代表政府向荷印僑胞之爲國效勞表示嘉勉，並以日本投降前後荷印僑胞備嘗痛苦，代表蔣主度慰問，復擬調查當地僑胞在戰前戰時及最近所遭受之種種損害情形。我國僑胞居留於荷印者爲數逾兩百萬，歷年關懷祖國，多所贊襄。此次飽經戰禍，僑胞所受損害，已至慘重，加以戰後印尼政府蓄意排斥華僑，最近且頒布苛例，禁止存留現款，並禁　華文信件，諸哪此類，不一而足，而數月以來無辜慘被屠殺者，更僕難數。我政府於此際特派專使，前往慰問，實足以表示我政府關注僑胞的一番至意。茲當李宣慰使南行之際，謹述數言，用爲歡送，瘦兼以告我荷印僑胞。</p>
<p>中國與荷印發生交往，歷時甚久，三佛齊爪哇諸國曾數數入貢，載在史冊。自明清以迄近世，國人之前往荷印者，踵趾相接，即在今日，我僑胞之在荷印者，仍爲構成荷印國民生活中主要之一部。自荷印淪入荷蘭統治以後，印度尼西亞人的故國，久已不存；差幸荷蘭政府勵精圖治，荷印資源的開發及荷印的政治設施，在一般被統治人民中不能不算稍強人意，但自經此次戰事，縱有荷蘭婦女王威廉明娜的開明宣告，終壓制不住民族情緒的高漲。而有所謂印度尼西亞共和國運動的出現。一直到今天，荷印的局勢還依舊混亂。我僑胞於荷印作戰的時候，及其後的日本佔領期內，已經創巨痛深，如今日本投降，重又遭受戰禍的損害，我們於同情之外，謹表示深切的慰問。</p>
<p>關於荷印的政治局勢，我們不欲在此有所論列。誠如李宣慰使所雲，荷印情形頗爲混亂，控制荷印政府有三，一爲主要由英軍所主持的聯軍政府，一爲荷蘭所主持的荷印政府，再則就是印度尼西人所組織的印度尼西亞政府。在這三種政權之下，使我居留荷印僑胞招致種種不使乃損害，原可想像。在爪哇蘇門答臘等地，近且數見排華行爲，釀成流血慘案。關於是項慘案，我們希望李宣慰使詳爲調查，並要求荷印當局嚴予懲處，給予死傷者的親屬以應得的賠償，並保證不再有同樣情事發生。爲了確保我荷印僑胞的權益，同時，亦爲了整個荷印的前途，我們衷　希望荷印的局勢能夠早日澄清。至於荷印所有種種歧視我僑胞的法令，尤應據理力爭，要求撤廢，自更不待發言。</p>
<h3>美總統協助猶太人的聲明</h3>
<p>在巴勒斯坦猶阿問題糾緾不清的時候，杜魯門總統突然發表聲明，主張猶太難民立即大批移殖馬巴勒斯坦，並贊成猶太人在巴勒斯坦適當區域建立猶太國，反對巴勒斯坦由猶阿分治的計調。</p>
<p>這一個聲明是很唐突的，而且在事實上也似首行不通的。它是很唐突，因爲杜魯門事先並未徵求英國的意見。英國艾德禮首相，接到通知，立即請其暫緩發表，亦未接受。在事實上它行不通，因爲英國主張猶阿分治，同屬於國統治之下，決不表肯放棄自己的統治權，讓猶太人成立一個獨立國。至於移民問題，英國正用全力禁止，不願得罪阿拉伯人弄成僵局。杜魯門總統的辦法，英國一時是決不肯接受的。</p>
<p>不單是英國政府反對，阿拉伯人更要反對。阿拉伯人在巴勒斯坦已經住了幾百年，早已經認爲巴勒斯坦是他們自己的地方。並且猶太人在知識和財力上均比他們優越，同猶太人競爭阿拉伯人根本沒有徼倖的機會。種族的仇視和經濟的門爭，是巴勒斯坦猶阿兩族的根本問題。對於根本問題，杜魯門總統完全沒有想出應付的方案，忽然之間宣佈願意協助猶人移民，建立猶太國，事實上是辦不到的。</p>
<p>當然，假如杜魯門總統真的決心，要實行他的聲明，那麼他必須要派遣龐大的美國軍隊，據專家估計需要五十尤，護送猶人入境，並且長期駐守巴勒斯坦，幫助猶太人抵抗阿拉伯人和回教聯盟的侵奪。這樣的舉動，不但杜魯門總統不願意，就算願意，美國國會，政府官吏和大多數人也要反對。結果事實上仍然不能實行。</p>
<p>這些都是極平常的事實，假如我們說杜魯門總統沒有見到未免太滑稽了。然而他爲什麼要突然發表這個不可能的聲明？依我們的推測，杜魯門總統這次的舉動，主要的目的是在爭取國內猶太份子的同情，並不是誠心要解決巴勒斯坦問題的爭執。目的既然是內政而不是外交，外交上否能夠實行，根本沒有關係。杜魯門總統目前所需要的，是要對國內的猶太份子作出一種同情的姿態，以博得他們的擁護。聲明不過是一種姿態，聲明以後遭遇阻　，不能實行，自然英國和阿拉伯人來負責任，杜魯門總統無論如何是成功的。</p>
<p>關於杜魯門總統這樣政治作風，我們還有一個強有力的旁證。據美國最近新聞記者的報道，華萊士演說的經過真象已經大明。杜魯門總統素來就不贊成華萊士的外交政策，從今年三月因爲冰島交涉華萊士發表演說以後，杜魯門總統已經就不許他再談外交。然而在九月初杜魯門總統因爲紐約市長選舉問題，感覺有拉攏左傾份子的必要，所以不但特別批准華萊士的演說，而且當著新聞記者表明他批准華萊士的「全部演說」。到後來引起國內外很大的風波，他事先並未料到，因爲他那時正全神貫注到國內的黨爭。</p>
<p>猶太人在美國的政治勢力是不可輕視的。雖然人數不多，然而政府的官職，新聞的機構，國會議席，尤其是重要的企業，猶太人都有支配的本事。全世界的猶太人，無論在那一個國家，都走兩個極端：一個就是憑籍聰明，因緣時會，成爲大資本家或社會上學術上的領袖，一個就是毫無機會，成爲無產階級，而取得工人領導的地位。所以無論在左右方面，猶太人都有政治的勢力。美國的執政黨，在下一次選舉，要希望仍然勝利，似乎須費大力，而杜魯門總統的號召力，誰也承認遠不及羅斯福。戰後外交和政力面許多措施，雖然一半由於環境惡劣，卻給反對黨以嚴厲指　的機會。杜魯門總統似首感覺著這種危機，所以正用盡方法，去爭取國內的群眾。這個解釋，就是不算完全正確，至少也可說有大部分近於事實。因爲據聯合社華盛頓四日電稱：「此中原因，係爲紐約方面，曾有人登載廣告，攻擊政府與民主黨應付此事，未能得宜。」紐約的廣告，爲美國猶太所登，當無疑義。</p>
<p>一個國家的內政，常常影響外交。在歐洲近代史上，一個國家的當政者，以鞏固他們本身的地位，在二十五年前英國哲學家羅素，在他的「到自由之路」一書中，早已經沉痛的指謫過。現在世界上好些國家的當局，依然成天地對本國人民誇張未來的戰爭，其故也不外乎此。這在他們保持權力的立場上，也許是很聰明，然而放了炮不一定顧到其後果，終非可以爲調的辦法。</p>
<h3>英閣局部改組的感想</h3>
<p>傳說已久的英國內閣局部改組，終於在前天宣佈了。閣員更迭，雖僅以海陸空三部大臣爲　，但是這次改組卻有極重大的意義。</p>
<p>第一，英閣添設國防部，統一英國的軍事機構，由海相亞力山大出任大臣，對於英國的國防，實爲一重大的革新。英國此舉，傳說已久，陸軍參謀長蒙哥馬利元帥上月初前往華府，考察美國軍事組織時，就表示英國將該依照美國將來在軍事上合作。因此，在神經過敏的人看來，英國添設國防部，不啻是準備應付「未來的戰爭」。其實按之第二次世界大戰所獲得的經驗與教訓，海陸空軍的統一指揮，是戰略上不可缺少的因素。故在今日軍事機構的一元化，乃世界各國共同的趨勢。所以英國政府宣佈，這次改革是英國軍事機構四十年來自然發展的結果，當是一句由衷之言。</p>
<p>第二，英國這次內閣改組，起用了好幾個年青有爲的少壯派，使英國的政府注入了許多新的血液，以免太老大了不容易推動。外次麥克尼爾的驟升國務大臣，足見工黨政府頗有羅致少壯派入閣的作風。今日的艾德禮內閣，不問它的政績如何，也不論外界對於他它的批評如何，終是世界上富於朝氣的內閣。</p>
<p>第三，去年五月德國投降之後，英國即舉行普選，工黨獲得空前大勝而組織新閣。其時國內百孔千瘡，復員建設殊非易易。內政上雖不無新　建樹，而外交政策，仍不能盡脫保守黨的作風。但在另一方面，由保守黨看來，卻已非常不滿。今日工黨內閣的處境，頗有夾縫中道路，愈走愈狹之感。</p>
<p>第四，英國內閣經過這次改組之後，雖然起用若幹少壯派份子，但是工黨元老派，大半仍留在內閣中，對於一般性的施政方針，不致有何變動。工黨政綱的重點，仍舊在國營政策上，俾能改善國民的經濟生活。不論保守黨如何反對，但開黨內閣決不因此而改變主張或路線。</p>
<p>第五，英國工黨的施政方針，在原則上大半爲人民所贊同，僅在實踐的時候，常常缺少勇往直前的精神，而不免舉棋不定。但是我們研究個中的原因，實在也是格於目前的環境所致。戰後的英國，物質上的困難，姑置勿論，即以其外交而言，英國如何對外相貝文，對於如何從目前苦悶的局勢中求出路，費了極大的苦心。我們以爲英國人最是老謀深算，尤其在縱橫　　的國際大局中，英國的外交政策往往是轉移於不知不覺之間，而始終不變其維持世界均勢之一貫方針。老成也罷，少壯也罷，保守也罷，進步也罷，英國人終是英國人，英國政府終是英國政府。戰後世界大局，盡管表面上重心似已在美蘇之間，而英國政府的一舉一動，仍然有舉足　輕之勢。這一點，中國人尤其須深切認識的。</p>

<p>征所得稅公平辦法</p>
<p>所得稅是人民應盡之義務，而政府取之之道，亦應有其合理之標準，不能前後自相逕庭，相去天壤，以昭大信方可，茲研究薪工所得稅新舊規定之比較如下：</p>
<p>向例　所得在一百元以下者免徵，至一百元徵一角爲千分之一。</p>
<p>新例　自所得五萬一千元起徵，但此數按工商界依照八月份本市生活指數發薪者，其底薪不過十一元，至一百元底薪依該生活指數發給爲四十五萬餘元，照新率應徵所得稅約兩萬幾千餘元，估所得千分之六十五強，即較向例一百元徵千分之一者大六十五倍，即以本市公務員底薪一百元所得約二十萬元計，照薪率應徵所得稅四千七百九十元，亦估千分之廿四，即大於向例廿四倍。</p>
<p>向例　徵所得時爲一九〇元，一元九角爲百分之一。</p>
<p>新例　工商界依八月份生活指數並高薪級打折扣發給之例，則底薪一九〇元者，所得約七十餘萬元，按新率應徵所得稅約五萬五千元，佔百分之八。</p>
<p>向例　徵所得稅達所得之百分之八時，須其所得超過一千元以上。</p>
<p>新例　照上計算超過底薪一九〇元以上者，所徵均爲百分之八以上，至相近百分之十。</p>
<p>觀上略舉比較，可見徵收薪工階級之所得稅，較之舊例所得增太甚，有傷元氣，良以薪工階級多數爲社會中下級幹部，而非醬家或高級官員，一切國難財，勝利財，接收財均無其份，而八年來特薪工所入，食不飽，衣不暖，與質偕貸，百孔千蒼，喘息未復，今一般收入名爲二十萬元，而其購買力實祇四十元。驟須繳此前後相去天壤之所得稅，又須應付本市新加之各稅，負擔子女教育重費，（請勿忘他國係政府負擔），勉強生活之薪工所入，大打折扣，如何聊生。又云：將自本年四月份起，依新率追繳，更將不堪，最公平合理之辦法，應照向例之稅率依其底薪計算，再照其所得之成數照倍之，例如底薪一百元者，照向例徵一角，若其所得照生活指數乘之者，亦將一角照樣乘之，若公務員之另有倍數者亦照倍之。豈非最爲公允，願爲我薪給階級一呼　之。（范正邦）</p>
<p>規定區域名稱徵見</p>
<p>抗戰勝利，租界收回，過去兩租界洋文譯普路名，已全盤改做中國化名字，但以上海面積之大，地域之遼闊，從前路名，雖然冗長繁雜，因爲歷史性與習慣性關係，長居上海市民，頗能毫不思索，加以記憶辦認，現在一下子全部改名，要把上海這許多大小路名，一條條說出，實在感覺困難，所以到現在一般市民口中，仍叫著老路名，書寫信件，亦是新舊亂用，情形正同陰陽歷一樣，尤其電車賣票，到站頭知照乘客，亦喊老路名，鄙人曾親見一乘客問賣票，這條路新路名叫什麼？他回答：「阿拉新路名不曉得，」所以概見。</p>
<p>鄙人以爲在這樣大的都市中，「市」與「路」之間，似乎尚少一個區域名稱的規定，雖然「虹口」「閘北」「南市」「大世界，」可算區域名稱，但有的是歷史舊名，有的是因事因物而名，從來未見市政當局有明白規定，「虹口」東到什麼路爲止，南西北到什麼路爲止，亦無詳細界限，自治機構的區別，與警察分局的轄境，究竟算不算正式區域名稱，亦無規定，並且各區的四至界限，亦未見明白詳細劃分公布，市民要在這樣大的市區中，一大堆的路名中，認清辨識，實在一件不容易的事，所以「英租界」「法租界」等廢名，仍在日常生活上應用。</p>
<p>除開路名難記不論，沒有區域規定及名稱，在整個市政組織與設施上，似乎亦是一個缺點，鄙意市政當局應即實施，（一）正式劃分市區地域界限，規定名稱公布，（二）通告機關，團體，學校，商店，郵局，及個人開具地址書寫信件時，必須冠以地域名稱，（三）與興圖出版社約定印行分區設色之上海市地圖，如此，路名記憶辨識，可以縮小範圍，久必熟穩，而市政設施，亦臻完善，質之賢明，以爲如何。（平明）</p>
<p>繳房捐罰的疑問</p>
<p>編輯先生：我是兆豐別墅一個住戶，九月十八日中午，接到房捐通知單，限九月十八日交款。三萬幾千元，說小不小，也得籌劃籌劃，到二十日交到開納路指定的所在要罰遲納費十分之一。和他們理論，他們說：「我們只知道照單收錢，你要申說，到裏頭去。」我不懂裏頭是何所在，不敢冒昧，只得認罰而歸，我想來想去，辦事人總將通知單早已發出，送的人耽擱了吧？我希望明察的當局，下次收捐時注意些，勿使有同樣事情發生，否則人民要疑慮當局有意拾克哩！（老石）</p>

<p>（一）維護基督敎，抵抗對於該敎之一切攻擊；（二）保衛採取議會方式之政府；（三）確保國家安全，不受外來侵略，並維持海上貿易之安全；（四）維持司法絕對獨立，不受任何形式之干涉與壓迫；（五）改革財政，並確保國家支出之嚴格管理；（六）保衛並發展帝國貿易，捨此英國無以自；（七）贊成改善國民健康與社會情形之一切措置；（八）擁護自由企業，反對統制貿易與工業國營。</p>
<p>指責政府優柔寡斷</p>
<p>〔聯合社英國黑池五日電〕邱吉爾今日在此間保守黨全國大會發表重要演說，以不列顚帝國之版圖日削，與蘇聯之勢力擴張，作爲對比。兼責工黨政府優柔寡斷，對於巴勒斯坦問題毫無方針計劃，並黯然預料印度方面可能有數百萬人困苦流血。印度一旦失去，則緬甸亦將立即陷入同樣命運，帝國人民將减至歷來所有四分之一。蘇聯則於同時額外吸收數千萬人民歸其統治，國勢尙在繼續擴張之中。據邱氏宣稱，英國內政外交問題雖多，予以優閑之身，本可安享林泉，數月前常作此想，惟由今日觀之，覺其局勢至爲嚴重，此後情形尤爲可慮，故決計在予精神能力，尙足支持，並荷諸君信任之日，勇往直前，願爲先驟。邱氏對於貝文之政策表示一般的同意，並願與蘇聯保持友好關係，其意見亦與貝文相同。但猛烈攻擊艾德禮首相之印度政策，謂印度幅員廣大，人口尤衆。獨立以後，不久將與不列顚聯邦脫離，而成爲一不十分友好之外國。英統治印度所造成之團結，將迅速消滅，數百萬人困苦流血之慘狀，將無可測度。依照本人計劃，應給與印度以完全自治領地位，包括全部離開不列顚聯邦之權利在內。邱氏最後復慨然曰，類此之事不一而足，幾於無日無時蔑有。巨舶在風平浪靜之海洋中漸漸下沉，負責者應竭全力使之上浮，不意反將底門開放，以速其沉沒，此事在歷史上將永留一個痕跡。</p>
<h3>美國超空堡壘　北極兜圈成功　自檀香山至埃京開羅　歷程萬哩需時卅九小時半</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社開羅五日電〕未來之戰爭將以北極爲中心，巨型機在北極氣候中是否能飛行自如，尙成疑問。美國飛行家伊爾文上校爰於昨日駕駛「夢艇」號超空堡壘飛機試騐，自檀香山出發，取道北極「大圓周」前來開羅冒盡艱險，於本日午前七時五十六分到達此間，費時三十九小時半。此次飛行雖未打破海軍飛機「浪龜」號最近造成之不停留飛行紀錄，但已證明巨型飛機橫渡大陸飛行有取道北極之可能性。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦六日廣播：飛越北極之美陸軍B—二九巨型轟炸機，今日在開羅降落，但朱能打破美海軍以前所建之紀錄。</p>
<p>〔聯合社開羅六日電〕美陸軍巨型機「夢艇」號於今日午前八時零二分（上海時間星期日午後四時）完成飛越地球頂部之長征。此次試騐，美政府須耗資三百萬元，惟機員所獲紀錄，對於當局計劃派飛機經常飛過氷帶區域，則有重大價値。該機由伊爾文上校指揮，機員共十人，自檀香山起飛時，所載重量達十四萬入千磅，內汽油七七·三五二磅，已打破紀錄。</p>

<h3>英蘇交易談判停頓</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦六日廣擴：星期時報今稱：英蘇貿易談判，現已完全停頓，蘇方代表若干人已離倫敦返蘇聯。</p>
<p>〔中央社倫敦六日合衆電〕星期泰晤士報稱英蘇商務會議已陷僵局，一部份蘇聯專家正在返蘇途中，蓋因英國製造廠幾不能在兩年以內交出蘇聯所訂之機器與電器設備。日期遲延之原因，由於貿易局無權對任何特別顧主予以優待而交出工業產品。</p>

<h3>杜魯門主建猶太國　英堅決表示反對　謂有損於巴勒斯坦會議</h3>
<p>〔聯合社倫敦五日電〕杜魯門統統要求令猶太人立即大量移居巴動斯坦，英首相艾德禮已親自答覆，此事今日由外交部方面與以證實，並暗示照會中措辭頗爲堅强，但其內容不致公布。據外交部發言人稱，杜魯門總統此舉至爲突兀，殊使英國不解。英國按照委任統治權，仍爲巴勒斯坦之唯一管理者，並無接受美國或其他局外國家建議之義務。同時在華盛頓方面，據白宮中人宣稱，社魯門總統與艾德禮首相對巴勒斯坦問題曾有機密電報往來，但其內容不能宣布。</p>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓五日電〕白宮發言人今日謂社魯門總統最近所發表關於巴勒斯坦問題之文吿，已引起「微妙」之局勢。據駐華盛頓英國大使署方面消息，關於該問題之一切消息，或由杜魯門與艾德禮直接交換，或由倫敦美國大使署轉達。惟據負責方面已徵實英政府之不贊成此項文吿，揹詞極形堅决，且對於可能的反響取至嚴重之觀念。杜魯門總統此舉，除有損於倫敦巴勒斯坦會議外，且恐將有重啓猶太極端份子新的激烈行動之危險。</p>
<p>〔路透社耶魯撒冷五日電〕巴勒斯坦阿拉伯高級委會今夜宣布，將於明日答覆杜魯門總統主張立即容許猶太移民入巴勒斯坦之文吿。</p>

<h3>美國的豪華生活（上）</h3>
<p>— （俞晶譯）</p>
<p>天之驕子揮金如土　物資缺乏求過於供</p>
<p>美國的財富與日俱增，已往的計算方法，已經無法衡量美國的錢財。美國人民和財產，並沒有像一般人預計地蕭條起來。統計曲綫都上昇了。人們的需要激增，吃的食物；穿的衣服，看的書和影戲，乘坐的車輛和飛機，住的大厦，無論什麼都缺乏，整個國家充滿了需要，瘋狂地襲擊着各種店舖。無論什麼貨物，一旦陳列出來，便賣得凈光，一萬五千元美金一件的鼬皮大衣，一千元美金的男用手錶，像賣炒蛋排骨一般銷路好。</p>
<p>目前的繁榮是不正常的，與太平時候的「興盛」完全不同。市塲上財富充斥而貨物貧乏，其實貨物生產數量已經高於已往，但仍呈異常貧乏的現象。肉，麵包，牛油，牛奶，糖，猪油都很稀少，木材，煤，鋼，X光管，麻袋，起重機，養花暖室，鉛管也很缺乏，還有火車飛機的坐位，旅舖的房間，甚至於人才，藥劑師，商人，獸醫，木匠，園藝家，電話接线生，畫家和廚子。</p>
<p>需要是無窮的，人人都有錢，沒有人經濟破產。各種商業都飛黃騰達，本年三月份百貨公司物品傾銷量，相當於一九三六年至三九年平均傾銷量百分之二六三。紐約電話公司的分類電話索引，是歷史最龐大的。明年的航空路綫乘客數量預計等於前五年的火車乘客數量。一九二九年工人數量是四千六百萬，現在也不過五千三百萬。</p>
<p>這種種現象怎樣解釋呢？綜合起來可分四方面說明之。還有一個不很可靠的推測，這推測就是說美國即將遭到一次週期的恐慌。當美國戰時生產停止後，必然發生一次經濟的劇烈變化。華盛頓之某經濟學家預言，美國特有八百萬人失業，但是爲個恐慌却只是一個謎。物質的缺乏已經來臨同時勞力的缺乏也日見顯著。第一，累年搖役　人民疲憊</p>
<p>專家所估計的，祗是物質方面的恐慌，而遺漏了人的缺乏。戰爭突然停止，人民都鬆懈下來，每人希望換換環境休養生息。遠征的軍人回國來了，婦女們就停止工作，很多人改變了職業，很多人到各處游歷觀光，很多人休假，很多人調動，很多人去練習運動。總之，生產者寡，消費者衆，整個美國可以說在罷工的狀態中。各種工業的工人都有一個月的罷工假期，美國工廠的製造家被很多人包圍，要求出品貨物，但是他的工廠部在罷工下停頓着，這種現象非常普遍。</p>
<p>我們試想在戰爭的四年半中，美國人民以是大的工作效率苦幹，旣缺乏享受，又沒有休假。如今戰爭勝利，誰肯振臂歡呼幾聲之後再抓起工具作苦工？如果我們明瞭戰後美國生活劇烈的變化，目前的現象就無足爲怪了。</p>
<p>經濟學家是無法列圖表證明目前的情形，是一種疲勞心理的反應，也不能用指數計算美國人需要多少時候來休養生息，增加享受，提高娛樂，這就是當前美國經濟問題的重點。</p>

<h3>無獨有偶　撞車兩慘案　滬西復興路口　火車撞斷大卡車　六人慘斃十四人受傷　外灘電車衝毀小吉普</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨晨三時許，夜色深沉，秋雨淅瀝。滬杭綫自上海麥根路貨站開出之第八〇五號貨車一列，駛經滬西中山路復興路口，與行總汽車裝配廠滿載工人之十輪大卡車(第一二四三四號）一輛發生猛烈互撞。緣該卡車載有工人二十名，適在斯時疾駛越過鐵路，於黑暗中先與木柵相撞，橫歇鐵道上。該列火本由東西駛，一時不及煞車，致將卡車撞成兩段。卡車司機當塲斃命。其餘乘坐車中工人悉數被彈出車外丈餘處，受傷輕重不一，僅一人未曾受傷。經附近崗警聞訊，急召救護車到塲，分頭飛送公濟·大公·紅十字會等醫院療治。其中因傷勢過重在中途或抵院之際不及救治而死者凡五名。連司機共六人慘死非命。十二人傷勢較輕，餘三人傷勢最重，迄今尙未脫險境，生命堪虞。出事後，北站方面亦即接獲報吿，立刻派出起重車，淸道車，及小工機匠等趕往將損壞車輛吊起，淸除鐵道。滬杭綫交通曾因之停頓半小時。至肇禍之責任問題，現正由各有關方面會同調查中。罹難者之家屬聞耗後，均趕往出事地點，號哭不止，情况殊爲悲慘，聞行總將優予撫恤云。</p>
<p>〔又訊〕截至昨晚截稿時止，留紅十字會醫院救治之七傷者中，除沈國泉一名不治身死外。餘六人之姓名爲蔣阿七·陳强生·徐餘祥·陳瑞生·單浩生再有一名因傷重不能開口，不詳其姓氏。送公濟醫院救治者，爲劉相如·楊溫星·馮根寳·趙雲白。大公醫院之傷者四人，姓名不詳。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕吉普卡肇禍案件，每天總有發生，昨天繼撞火車慘案之後，外灘北京路口在下午一時半又發生小吉普猛撞電車的慘案，可謂無獨有偶。結果駕駛第一五七三四號吉普的美國海軍一名，當塲被摔車外，頭部撞在該處A字五十四號電柱上，以致頭破血流，不省人事，其所駕的吉普，亦受傷甚重，被撞之十七號一路有軌電車，駕駛台略有損壞，幸無傷人，出事後，經崗警急召救護車將傷者車送醫院醫治，但交通因之阻斷一小時。</p>

<h3>內部行政司長哈雄文抵滬談建筑人才異常缺少　解決房荒二點意見</h3>
<p>內政部行政司司長哈雄文氏，數月來視察收復區各大城市之建築事業及各項工程，昨由京抵滬公幹，記者特往訪，並以中國建築工程之槪况與哈氏數月來視察各收復區都市之建築情形叩詢之。據云：中國建築工程，素稱落後。建築工程師人才之缺乏，爲其當前主要問題，國內各大學，設有建築系者，僅中央大學·重慶大學·中山大學等數校，每年造就之人才，寥寥可數，以目前建築事業之急需開展，此項人才實不敷應用。此次視察收復區各大城市，曾促成各城市組織都市計劃委員會，迄今已成立者，有南京·上海·天津等地，後方八大城市，重慶·成都·西安·蘭州·昆明·貴陽·桂林·衡陽等，計劃委會於戰時早經成立，目前尙在籌組中者，尙有靑島·廣州·漢口·南昌等地，此外復於各大城市成立公共工程委員會，係聯合工務·公用·衛生·地政等機構所會合組成。年來各地政府主管長官，對工務公用等事業，均已特別重視，此在中國行政史上實屬一大轉變。哈氏以爲視察所得，最感欣慰興奮者，莫過於此點。因我國建築事業之落後，實有賴賢明之地方政府，予以切實協助也。</p>
<p>此外論及各地房荒之嚴重問題時，哈氏認爲除人口稠密之上海市外，其他各地並無想像之嚴重。哈氏以爲欲解決上項困難，祇有採取兩個辦法：一，獎勵法，獎勵建築，如有自動建築公寓住宅者，特予免除各項稅則，政府貸款，及溝通建築材料之來源等。二，强制法，以政治力量，規定工廠學校之新設者，必須備有充量之宿舍，否則不予登記或立案，如此則房荒問題，自能逐漸解決。哈氏此次來滬，係出席中國建築師學會年會，哈氏爲該會會員，並當選此屆常務理事。</p>
<h3>市府變賣物資案　賑面審核尚無訛　清查團長張知本定日內晉京</h3>
<p>中央接收工作淸查團團長張知本氏，定日內晋京，關於市府接收僞中央市塲變賣物資一案，前由淸查團將賬册移送上海審計處審查，據悉，審計處已將初步調查結果，製就報吿。現金收支部分：錢市長任內變賣三十億零三千餘萬元，吳市長任內變賣十二億零四千餘萬元，除大部用作職員薪貼外，亦有用作市政措施，現僅結存三千萬元，賬面大致無訛。</p>
<h3>新聞界「老手」羅果夫築防綫　他希望別人帶新聞給他　自己卻連滴水也不透漏</h3>
<p>〔本報特寫〕塔斯社新任駐華總經理羅果夫，是一位肥胖，愉快而風趣橫溢的人物。</p>
<p>在拜訪他之前，我存了相當大的「收穫」的期望、想從這一位對中國有相當歷史而最近幾年則在美英二國消磨光陰的蘇聯通訊機關的領導人物口中，得到一點他對於世界對於中國各方面的意見和觀感，但是在跟他接談之下，我却完全失敗了。羅果夫的確不愧爲一位從事新聞事業的「老手」，他顯得這樣老練機警，他的防綫築得如此堅固，用具體一點的話來說。簡直「連一滴水都透不進」。可是，在另一方面，他却用俏皮幽默的言辭，以微細有趣的動作，使空氣非常融治，非常輕鬆。</p>
<p>早就聽說羅果夫能够說一口流利的國語，但他跟我談話時却用的英語，推說是離華歲年，把中國話忘了。我問他重來上海有什麼印象？他說，來這裏祇有五天，還沒有時間想過。我問他對於中國的時局有什麼意見？他說，這是應該向莫斯科報吿而不想對報界發表。我再問他在英美的觀感如何？他的答覆是那還是戰爭尙未結束時候的事，現在情形該已變了。在所有的短短十幾分鐘談話中，他所吿訴了我一點，那就祇是：蘇聯已開始另一個更偉大的五年計劃，而蘇聯，照他的看法，是「更巨大了。」（Sovier　is　Bigger）</p>
<p>我放棄了再求其他「收穫」的計劃，僅想替他攝影一幀即作爲道一次拜訪的滿意的結束。他却笑着說：「我又不是什麽電影明星，不必了吧！」但終於還是應允了我的請求。他走到衣架邊去將上衣穿好，領帶整理一下，以電影明星上鏡頭的姿態，他詼諧地間：「漂亮嗎？」我笑了，但是在鏡頭對準他的時候，他以更多的幽默引起了我不可抑制的笑聲。他說：「會不會有年靑的少女看到我的相片而喜歡我？你說會不會？你說有沒有希望？」他說得這樣自然，這樣從容，但我在這種有趣的塲合之下，却是顯得如此拙笨。我一時想不出什麽同樣幽默的話來答復他，祇訥訥地說：「很有希望，很有希望！你看起來還很年靑！」這倒並不是胡謅的恭維話，他的確看上去還很年青，所差的就是浮胖了一點。他接着說：「很有希望？我的兒子已比你大了呢！」</p>
<p>談話就在愉快的氣氛中結束．他笑着送我出門口，拍着我的肩膀說：「希望你別從我這裏要新聞，相反的，倒希望你帶些新聞給我！」</p>

<h3>冒充技術人員　留華日僑留戀不去　生活逍遙　爲非作歹　戰犯管理處奉命察查</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕國防部戰犯管理處，最近已兼負管理留華日僑之責，並將詳細調查所有留華日僑任務，如非屬必要者，將仍予遣送回國。按自勝利以來，在華敵僑除大部份業經陸續遣送回國外，尙有一小部份以技術人員名義留華者，人數連眷屬在內，約近三千人左右。此輩日僑之留華，當初均係僅憑僱用機關之一紙證書，故情形頗爲複雜。其中固多確爲技術人員，然亦有並無專門技術，而因另有企圖，留戀斯土，活動若干雜牌機關，出給證明者。自日僑管理委員會撤銷以後，對於此輩日僑即無統一管理之機構，僅由各僱用機關自行約束，頗有疏忽寬縱之處，致生活逍遙者有之，爲非作歹者亦有之。而眞正之技術人員，亦有因僱用機關本身缺乏經費或設備等種種關係，工作未能開展。彼輩雖經留用，數月來仍閒棄無用，徒糜口糧。最近當局有鑒於此，已責令國防部戰犯管理處統一管理，並予嚴密察查，以杜弊患。</p>

<h3>流動醫院　兩路巡回診療車替員工義務診治</h3>
<p>〔本報特寫〕京滬區鐵路管理局，從九月廿三日起，在京滬·滬杭兩綫上，添置了一種巡迴診療車，往來沿途各站，爲那些獻身鐵路工作的員工們和他們的家屬，以及保衛兩路安全的護路警備隊，義務診療疾病。</p>
<p>這種巡迴診療車，是一座流動醫院，正如二次世界大戰中，漂流海洋上的醫院船。牠們帶給人們安全和幸福，車身上的紅十字是一個仁慈的商標。</p>
<p>京滬和滬杭兩路，各有一輛巡迴診療車。京滬綫上由唐惠民醫師主持，滬杭綫上由畢保羅醫師負責。他們都富有經騐，而且熟悉各站的情形。每輛車上，還有兩位護士和一位工友帮忙。</p>
<p>巡迴診療車，雖然不過是由一節普通的鐵篷車改裝而成，內部的設備却相當完善，內外科各種主要的器械和藥品，差不多都齊全。車廂內全部漆成白色，一半是診療室和配藥間，還有一半是宿舍和廚房。</p>
<p>京滬區鐵路管理局，對於員工的醫藥衛生問題，一向非常注意，已先後在上海·南京·戚墅堰三地，設立鐵路醫院，並在杭州·嘉興·常州·蘇州·鎭江·下關各地，設立診療所。杭州的診療所，正預備擴充爲醫院。</p>
<p>至於巡迥診療車，則是補鐵路醫院和診療所的不足。它附屬於上海鐵路醫院。</p>
<p>在京滬綫上，星期一晨七點半，從北站開出，到崑山停下來，開始服務；星期二在無錫，星期三在丹陽和龍潭。星期四又回到崑山，星期五再是無錫，星期六又是丹陽·龍潭二地。星期日回到上海，添置藥品。到了星期一早晨，又開出去服務了。在各地停留診療的時間，從兩個到三個半鐘頭。</p>
<p>至於滬杭綫上，星期一·四在松江，星期二·五在長安，星期三·六在閘口。</p>
<p>巡迴診療車。自從開始服務以來，看過的病人。已經有一千多了。其中以患瘧疾和腸炎的爲最多！兩路的員工們都希望以後能多有幾輛巡迴診療車呢。</p>
<h3>爭取新聞自由！　各報記者致宣司令一封公開信</h3>
<p>本市各報社記者因採訪警備司令部消息，殊多困難，甚至不得其門而入，雖經數度交涉，仍屬無效，爰經全體決議先行致函宣司令，請予改善，並發給記者出入證以便採訪，原函如下：</p>
<p>鐵吾先生：</p>
<p>我們是本市各報社採訪軍事新聞的記者，經一致決議，認爲有向先生公開申述我們的請求之必要。我們認爲値此新聞自由時期，我們應本着新聞記者的天責爲社會人羣服務，沒有任何理由，可以阻礙和封鎖我們的採訪。自先生集中領導軍警治安機關以來，對除暴安良種種德政，我們無不站在正義之立塲爲之鼓吹，宣傳，以促其成，從來沒有想到警備司令部對我們的採訪自由加以限制及阻礙。</p>
<p>記得在錢李兩總司令任內，曾發給來賓證，讓我們自由出入警備司令部，並可以隨便赴各處採訪，先生繼任以後，即逐步廢止，現在我們連警備部的大門都無法進入，據衛兵談稱：如果放一個記者入內，就要挨打五十軍棍，我們不了解先生對我們有什麼誤會，也不了解這種作風是先生自訂，還是別人玩的花樣？錢李兩總司令時代，曾公開對我們說過：「警備部決不關起大門，歡迎記者隨時前來指敎」從這一點看來，先生爲什麽不同意錢李兩總司令的開明辦法，我們實在不了解。我們爲了爭取採訪的自由，不得不表示堅決的反對和嚴重的抗議。</p>
<p>我們希望先生能夠接受我們的請求，發給我們的出入證，讓我們能夠自由採訪。誠然，警備司令部是軍事機關，多少帶點機密性，但是，有關軍事秘密的部份，警備部方面可以不必透露，萬一有刋載出軍事秘密的地方，我們做記者的願受法律處分。據先生的意見，說是記者自由出入，會影響辦公，這一點我們的意見是請求警備部於各處設一記者招待室，我們來的時候，可以不到辦公所，就在記者招待室會晤各處處長以下的人員，同時還請先生能够在每週抽出半小時的工夫接見我們一次，這是我們最低的要求。</p>
<p>至於警備部曾一段實行的新聞發佈辦法，那完全是公報性質，不一定是讀者所喜聞樂見的，我們也沒有必要專門爲警備部代發公報，我們要求在發給我們的公報以外，還允許我們自由採訪，這在我們說：是義務，也是權利。</p>
<p>這封信，我們在全國各報同時發表，務懇先生公開答覆爲感。中央日報徐開壘，和平日報黃彰才，民國日報胡道彰，新聞報周海萍，中國社焦超，前綫日報陳蔭善，中央社趙之誠，大光社彭君毅，正言報朱政，益世報沈永輝，大衆夜報張紹甫，申時社康子言，僑聲報楊久靑，申報徐守廉，華東社蔡　發，華美晚報兪晋豪，大公報朱佑慈，文匯報王坪，中華時報陳士謙，東南日報蔡極，新民報唐海，大晚報張蔚文，立報陸攸洛敬上十月六日。</p>

<h3>上海妇女服装滄桑史</h3>
<p>— （本報特稿）</p>
<p>時令已是深秋了。在都市裏，對於季節的轉變，是漠然的，可是都市裏的婦女們，似乎特別敏感，她們已脫下羅衫而試新裝了。上海畢竟是一個大都市，婦女們的服裝，日新月異，花樣翻新，不是可以和巴黎好萊塢相比麼？今年在時裝店的　窗裏，充塞著更多的歐美呢絨，使裁制新裝的興趣，格外濃厚些。在這「西風起，製寒衣」的時候，日來談談上海時裝的「滄桑」。</p>
<p>胡蝶　　旗袍而沒有腰身，現在就是覺得不大好看。就以　花邊而論在領口一帶也有些「擁擠」之　。</p>
<h3>時裝風氣　海禁開放以後一個重大轉變</h3>
<p>時裝的興起，還不過近百年來的事，在百年前，大家有「做一件，傳三代」底觀念。往往母女婆媳，更迭地穿著一件衣服，不顧身體長短肥　，穿了是否配身，更談不到衣服的材料和式樣。做一件衣，既可以穿得如此久長，所以不惜人工，闊鑲密滾，以示其美。好在那時候婦女們生活優閑，多化一點時間是無所謂的。同時在帝制時代，命婦服飾，早在法律上規定，即是常服，材料也有相當限制，式樣也不能失卻身份。這是維持婦女服裝式樣不變的一個主因。海禁開放以後，外國材料源源不絕地輸入，使人看了眼花，因輸入數量之多，流行更爲普遍。在鴉片戰爭以前，洋貨祇只羽紗，呢絨之類，後來花色日多，洋綢，洋緞，洋綿，要比國產綢緞便宜得多，洋布更充斥於市場。材料既易取得，觀念也漸漸地改變，做一件新衣，並無傳代之必要，衣服大小，肥瘦有別，尺寸更該合身一些。許多費時費工的滾坎覺得太贅累了，縫紉方法，亦日趨簡單化。同時外國裝飾之輸入，使式樣改變得更快，這種種都是造成風氣的原因，上海因華洋雜處，便得風氣之先，成爲時裝的權威者。過去所謂「京裝」「蘇式」已跟著衰落了。而南方的「粵裝」「港裝」，也可說是上海的一支。近百年來，上海乃操縱中國婦女裝飾的大本營。</p>
<h3>服裝的演變　照相館中試番裝奶罩打倒小馬甲</h3>
<p>在旗袍尚未流行以前，婦女們都是兩截穿衣的，材料也是洋貨，式樣大同小異。這時真正的時裝，謂之「番裝」，那是完全洋式服裝，但只限於小孩子的衣帽，婦女們雖然偶一穿之也僅在照相館中鏡頭上扮一「番妹」，穿起來在街上走的很少。上海香港等地，或能看見，內地絕對沒有。後來留日之風大盛，日本服裝也爲一般時髦女子所醉心。當時流行的衣衫是既窄且長，裙上也無　文，其色尚玄。配上手表，橢圓的小藍色眼鏡，加以皮包和絹傘，是最時髦不過的。此由留日學生介紹而來，表示她是一個具有「文明」思想的女子。</p>
<p>那時所謂時裝，對於　閣千金，影響尚少，而北裏中卻有許多奇衫怪狀。有一時，在褲的兩旁，做著插袋，插袋下面。又有排鬚纓絡。遠遠望去，仿佛「老學究」腰間所掛著的眼鏡袋。一字襟坎背，本是旗人裝飾，民國以後，也曾流行過一時。北裏名花，更有一盞小電燈。綴在襟扣之上，預儲乾電池於懷中，啟放時光采四射，顧盼生姿，可謂非夷所思。</p>
<p>袒胸露臂，本是西俗，在中國即使是生理上自然發展的乳部，也要加以束縛。自衣服式樣改小以後，小馬甲代替了從前的肚兜。把胸部緊緊包著，妨礙婦女的健康，影響嬰兒哺乳，莫此爲甚。但漸漸又沾染西方習俗，打倒小馬甲，而代以奶罩了。</p>
<h3>關於旗袍</h3>
<p>旗袍的流行，還是近二十年的事。開始流行於上海，漸漸流入內地，現在已經成爲婦女唯一的服裝了。但今日通行之旗袍，衹不過略仿旗裝，和真正滿人的旗袍，相去很遠。據光緒十四年出版之「遊滬筆記」中，有下列一段的記載：「洋涇浜一隅，五方雜處，服色隨時更易。……女則間效滿洲裝束，殊覺耳目一新」。然則六十年前，上海女子已有旗裝，但不過偶一嘗試罷了。</p>
<p>旗袍風行了二十年，在長度上，出手上，不知變更了多少次。有時長得拖腳背，走一步路還得把衣服提起一些。即整天鬧著無事的小姐們，也不勝其苦。爲了要漂亮，衹得做衣服的奴隸。後來漸漸改短，現在已快近膝蓋了，老先和免又要搖頭，以爲有傷風化。衣袖的長短大小，也是變換不定，最近幾年，夏令服裝，已經等於沒有袖子，冬天卻還是長袖的多。但許多摩登女子，在大冷的冬天，一雙玉臂，依舊露在外面，在暖氣設備不很普遍的中國，就是不出門，也到底有些耐不住。現在又從窄袖而改爲大袖，西風從袖口裏吹進去，在冷天更受不了。</p>
<p>一件長馬夾</p>
<p>有一時期盛行一件長馬甲，加在旗袍的外面。這是從旗裝的坎背變化而來的。據說爲影星黎明暉所創始，有人見過黎明暉的一封信，內雲：「我的新衣早就做好了，一件長背心，一件薄紗旗袍，背心單在旗袍上，又好年，又大方。這是我的新發明，別人沒有穿過，你願意來參觀嗎」？於是婦女們紛紛摹仿，成爲一時風尚，後來漸漸地走了樣，外面雖然是長馬甲，可是單在裏面的，已不是長旗袍而是一件短襖。甚至在掛肩上做一線縫，假充長背心。且較長背心，更爲熨貼，於是一而二，二而一，不可復辦。</p>
<p>華僑愛穿旗袍</p>
<p>婦女們穿旗袍，不僅在中國普遍流行，並且流傳到美國，三藩市華僑來信曾說：「目前國人處處用美式配備，但美國婦女卻愛穿中國旗袍，此在我國婦女聞之，當引爲無上光榮」。這還是民國廿四五年間事，可惜抗戰旋起，否則到很可以藉此推廣國產絲綢的銷路。時裝專家張　英說：旗袍有許多優點，和西洋服裝有異曲同工之妙。可見旗袍之流傳於海外。亦非偶然之事。</p>
<h3>民國歷年來服裝演進</h3>
<p>歷年女子服裝的變遷，究竟是怎樣一回事呢？民國二十五年二月廿三日廣州婦女界舉行了一次民國歷年來婦女服裝之演進的表演，可知進化過程的大概：</p>
<p>民國元年　舊式結婚禮服，團鶴禮服，滑髻褂裙。</p>
<p>民國二年　馬鞍頜，窄袖及八摺裙，燕尾髻。</p>
<p>民國三年　平領禮服衫裙，开髻。</p>
<p>民國四年　衫裤，蝴蝶髻。</p>
<p>民國五年　衫裙禮服，滑髻。</p>
<p>民國六年　長衫裙，開髻。</p>
<p>民國七年　大小角式衫裙，麻花髻。</p>
<p>民國八年　小姐裝衫褲，梳辮。</p>
<p>民國九年　方角衫裙，週身滾花邊，直S髻。</p>
<p>民國十年，綿緞闊袖衫裙，圓髻。</p>
<p>民國十一年　無領週身釘珠花衫裙。</p>
<p>民國十二年　無領印花衫及旗袍背心，花髻。</p>
<p>民國十三年　　花短裙及黑背心，橫S髻。</p>
<p>民國十四年　　花短六角衫裙，橫S髻。</p>
<p>民國十五年　大圓角短衫裙。</p>
<p>民國十六年　無卡駁袖旗袍，　花短旗袍。</p>
<p>民國十七年　短衫長裙，橫S髻。</p>
<p>民國十八年　　花及底下圓角旗袍背心。</p>
<p>民國十九年　一字襟假袖旗袍背心。</p>
<p>民國二十年　小方角旗袍。</p>
<p>民國廿一年　花邊旗袍。</p>
<p>民國廿二年　南京錦緞高卡旗袍。</p>
<p>民國廿三年　通邊旗袍及短褸。</p>
<p>民國廿四年　西式結婚禮服及白緞　花邊旗袍。</p>
<p>民國廿五年　時裝絨西服，　銀花旗袍及披肩，長袖旗袍。</p>
<h3>從成衣鋪　到時裝公司</h3>
<p>在過去，成衣鋪是唯一縫制時裝的場所，婦女們也是成衣鋪的大主顧，服裝的變遷越快，成衣鋪的工作越忙，生意也越加興隆。成衣鋪便分佈在整個上海。據民國廿九年的估計，全上海的成衣鋪計二千家，成衣匠四萬人，靠他們過活的妻子兒女，一起大約有二十萬人，實在不是小數目。成衣鋪招牌上往往冠以「蘇廣」二字，這是，說蘇廣兩地衣服的式樣最爲時式，他們也有按地方性而分爲蘇幫·揚幫。普通一二個夥計，再加上幾個學徒就行了。人數的多寡，則視其營業範圍而定，前幾年因爲生活費用高，工作少，成衣鋪生意都見得很清淡，勝利以後，從後方來的，不免都要添點衣服，剪刀針線，都見得忙碌了。</p>
<p>婦女的外衣，由綢質的鬥篷蛻變爲呢絨的大衣，已如上述，時裝公司乃乘時崛起。女裝大衣最初由專製男式西裝者帶做，漸漸成爲女裝專門。現在這種時裝公司，上海特多。第一流在靜安寺路同孚路一帶，霞飛路也是時裝公司的集中區。四馬路湖北路也不少。最初爲上海仕女設計打樣縫製的，要稱雲裳時裝公司，創辦人均爲海上名流，像交際花唐瑛，名律師江一平，藝術家江小　皆是。由唐女士在外宣傳，江則設計打樣。可是不久轉讓給他人了，現今當然要推鴻翔公司爲巨擘。</p>
<p>顧維鈞夫人看了這張速寫，你大概不會想到這就是國際著名的顧少川夫人吧？你看她的領口圈兒是否太大了一點？</p>
<h3>大衣種種　黃狼紫貂來外洋輕裘一襲四千萬</h3>
<p>在寒冷的冬天，過雲女子往往加上一件鬥篷，是用綢質製成的，在民國十六七年的時候，卻摹仿西洋婦女，改穿大衣。推行漸廣，現在已極普遍，早把鬥篷忘得一乾二淨了。</p>
<p>最初流行大衣，不過代替斗篷，出門禦寒而已。迨後花式漸趨複雜。冬季大衣之外，還有春秋兩季所穿的夾大衣，初喛新寒時有單大衣，連夏夜也可加上一件白色的綢質外衣，在長旗袍外面，調和色澤，益增美觀。所以這種大衣，大體上已是裝飾品，而不是禦寒之物了。</p>
<p>皮大衣乃高貴婦女的禦寒品。灰背紫貂，過去每襲售價，已是驚人。最初原用國產，從西北轉經北平，然後裝箱運送上海。其後外貨漸漸輸入，俄國的灰背，美國的紫貂，德國的兔皮，均爲人所珍視。德國的兔皮，大都先在我國收集，運回德國，用化學方法改造，再運到我國來，據說美國的紫貂，亦是用我國的黃狼皮改製的，但今年據鴻翔公司中人說：最高的皮大衣，是美國的黃狼皮，要四千萬元一襲，那究竟是否一而二，二而一？</p>
<p>絨繩最初用以織成內衣，不知誰想出來穿在外面，當作大衣，居然也流行過一個時期。但總不及呢絨來得適意，所以不爲高貴仕女們所愛穿，　　不很得志。</p>
<h3>時裝的風化罪？　浪子們的非非之想！</h3>
<p>在民國廿五年四月間，古老的北平和沾染四洋風氣最早的廣州，曾先後實行取締奇裝異服，以整飭風化。奇裝異服便遭遇了空前的厄運。所謂奇裝和時裝，本來不同，時裝已流行一時，當然無所謂「奇」，可是當局所取締的奇裝，和時裝是二而一的。以是一般時髦女子，只得藏在深閨，暫過十八世紀的小姐生活。</p>
<p>時裝是不是犯了風化罪？這話很不容易解釋。據粵省當局所稱：「民風之淳樸與否，與服裝殊有關係，昔人有言，護藏誨盜，治容誨淫，婦女之服裝，雖不以昔日之寬袍大袖爲美觀，然亦不以今日袒胸露臂之怪狀爲時尚。是以乃有嚴禁奇裝異服之舉。」彼所謂奇裝異服，實指夏令服裝，「輕紗輕綃，肌肉隱現，已不待言，而婦女輩更求涼快，袖不及肘，領不及胸，肘以下，胸以上，豁然呈露。」</p>
<p>粵省當局自五月五日起，由公安局女訓練員在路中實行勸導，並有風化紀巡　檢察隊檢查服裝。凡遇有穿著違反標準之服裝者即予糾正。不服者衣上蓋一碗口大之藍印。於是時裝女子，頓然　跡。但其時，登徒子乘機向時裝婦女調笑，市上竟發生「擠女」風潮。粵省婦女對當局措施，深致不滿，認爲侮辱，聯名請求取銷，對於所制定之標準服裝，亦表示反對。當局至此自知操之過急，禁令漸馳，終於無形廢止。同時在執行檢查之時，坐汽車者風馳而過，檢查人員，實亦無法行使職權。</p>
<p>取締奇裝異服，除了北平廣州之外，內地城市，也都施行過。上海不愧爲時裝中心，當局並未取締。時裝究竟要奇異到怎樣程度，才算妨礙風化，也難斷定。譬如廣州所取締的爲袒胸露臂，但近年來女子的夏令旗袍，袖不但不及肘，且已齊肩，赤腳不算，腳指上還搽著勞蔻丹，那末妨礙風化，是不是要更進一步？可是和西洋女子比較起來，仍是落後。所以這是開通與不開通的問題，至於所謂風化，僅是浪子們在作非非之想而已。</p>
<h3>新裝的選擇·注意四要點　色彩不當心變成老妖精</h3>
<p>一種時裝樣式，穿了出來以後，會很快的傳布開去，不久就便流行一時。盲目地去學時髦，是都市中女子所常犯的毛病，她們以爲凡是新的，都是好的，不問式樣是否與年齡相合，花紋是否與身份相配，穿了新裝，反而礙眼。</p>
<p>怎樣去選擇衣服呢？過去浙江大學何靜安女士曾提出了裁衣時所當根據的四個要點。第一要根據穿的人的態度，就是穿了以後要反把身份顯示出來。可分爲貴胄派·體育派·阿嬌派·阿母派·滑稽派·深秘派，及趣玩派等等。第二，衣服宜合乎形體，身體之各部之長短大小，人各不同，剪裁時須審視穿著各部之美惡，使美點益顯於外，惡點隱而不見。第三，斟酌穿者之職業，過去以貴婦人及妓女之服裝爲最新穎，但其間仍判若鴻溝，其後始混淆不分，此點最宜注意。第四爲服者之年齡，年輕者色彩應鮮艷，年長者應莊重。若雞皮鶴髮之婦人，而衣嬌艷之服，不將成爲「老妖精」乎？反之，年輕者而穿年長者之衣，必將減少其風韻。即青年與中年不同，婚前與婚後更不相同。</p>
<p>衣服的顏色花紋，應以心理爲依據。身材長的人，穿了直條紋的衣服，便格外見長，矮的人穿了橫條紋的衣服，便更顯得矮。條紋能使兩眼發生一種錯誤的觀點。單色衣服，宜於嬌小而不宜於擬肥的人，胖子而穿得單色的衣，更便形其胖。因單純的顏色，看起來，旁邊總會見一條陰影的。顏色有明暗之分，明色比較嬌艷，是年輕人穿的。年齡愈高，顏色也應愈暗。</p>
<p>寒衣在那裏</p>
<p>高貴的婦女，紛紛在計劃她們今年新裝的式樣。商店中已陣列著各種綢緞呢絨，盡管一襲數百萬數千萬，不會無人顧問。但普通市民，對千元一尺的布，萬元一襲的衣，也頗感棘手。在物價飛漲的今日，最低的生活程度，已難維持，一個月區區的收入，買柴　米，尚且不夠，如何能談得到添制新衣？所以新裝是替有錢的人預備著的，繁華的市容，也讓她們去點綴罷。</p>
<h3>氣象預測</h3>
<p>西比利亞反氣旋中心在中國西北部向東南進行，佈及全國，接觸及凝結於本區及東海，太平洋氣團籠罩日本朝鮮及琉球。</p>
<p>天氣預報　黃海　至晴而較冷，局部霧，中度至清勁北風。上海陰，間歇　至　，較冷，漸有晴意，中度至清勁西北風。東海陰，局部雨或濛至　，清勁北風至東北風，中浪至巨浪。</p>
<p>十六日溫度最高六八·八度，最低五八·一度。</p>
<h3>劉紀文夫人</h3>
<p>現在看起來，劉紀文夫人這件旗袍的領頭實在太高了一點。就是這種圍巾，現在也經不大看得見了。劉夫人在拍這張照的時候，正在參加一次「國貨時裝展覽會。」</p>

<h3>紗布業之隱痛　配紗少而不適用　黑市難消滅之主要原因棉布成本高平價亦不易</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕近日棉布市價，略見平定，而腳跟仍堅，且聞天津方面，又在漲價，刺激所及，成將再起漲風，棉布同業公會因市長甚注意於物價之抑平，正在設法調整之中，其　社之評價委員會，聞董久峰·潘士浩·高藹周·吳在榮·吳秧蓀·王申甫·丁方　·丁大富·王　才·周榕生·俞惠隆·姚宇恩·與　浩·孫照明·　柏年等均將參加，將來　分　務·調查·議價諸組，分頭工作，昨日該會南公所秋祭，到者三百於人，理事會負責人面請業中　宿維護正義，同共努力，均經允許，惟以來本增漲，減抑爲字號限制其售價，非特捨本逐末，無濟於事，而掩耳盜鈴，或將更引起黑市之猖獗，大部份同業且歷舉前被敵僞強迫微購紗布之損失，對於政府未允發選，引爲深切痛心之事，因目下一般棉布商資金與存貨兩感缺乏，政府就疑棉布有人囤積，則有此能力者並非正當之棉布商云，某權威者語入，目下單純織廠，利潤亦薄，如紗廠業認爲現在之黑市紗價無可減低，則布價難　抑低，</p>
<p>棉布之成本</p>
<p>並據其指陳，中檔十二磅細布，現售八萬帶零，其成本以二十支紗二百十萬計，爲紗本六萬三千元，工食槳粉廠繳等一萬五千元，合計七萬八千元，如再加上折舊及利息，僅可夠本，又稱棉紗聯合銷售，近期徒有其名，商廠出紗，其以一百五十五萬之官價配給布廠者究有幾何，已爲各方所注目，紗建雖能照官價明配，而出數有限，杯水無濟，織廠只能用以略事扯低用紗之成本而已，並據指稱，染織業公會所屬會員廠家，共有織機一萬八千餘台，而紡建僅間日配紗數百件，且須與各棉製品複製工業輪流核配，其所需原料指不敷，以至黑市紗之不患無出路，原因即在於此，</p>
<p>染織用紗量</p>
<p>且稱以開工一萬台計，每月可出布三十萬疋以上，須用紗八萬件左右，有若干廠家，因紗建每　配紗，亂掛多種牌子，而織廠所能實配者布過一二種，申請時因恐失配，每就各種牌子各爲一二件，及其所受配者，因支數及扎絞關係，並不能濟目　之急，則　有持以向黑市掉進別種棉紗者，其廠蕭資薄者，遇有所出布疋須二種棉紗交職，而受配者僅有一種時，甚至有　以出售。另買他紗以濟用者，此在棉紗市場中已數數發見，紗建公司正在密切注意此事，</p>
<p>轉賣之原因</p>
<p>在密切注意此事，目前染織廠公會負責人會與紗建負責人申明原委，紗建當局亦明嘹布廠雖間有出售配紗，而同時即買進黑市紗，且認爲黑市紗之去路，始終爲實用之廠家，惟認爲如此出進，終有背配受原則，勸令糾正，前日紗業公會市場上會因新光內衣廠之出售紗建配紗，引起糾紛，實則新光每日用紗甚多，除得紗建少數配售外，尚須向市上搜購，並　以轉賣紗建配貨爲　錢之手段者。</p>
<p>紗號業痛苦</p>
<p>棉紗之供應受紗官委會之統制，而黑市紗之活躍、仍爲問和古里紗號業公會內最引人逐一之風浪，據　悉其內容者談購，紗號業亦爲受敵僞強迫微用紗布面削弱元氣之一業，紗建配紗不及該業，業中人未免有害業不均之感，自民營紗廠加入織配，紗號因歷來之淵源，幸未向　，則其貨物之流通處所，當仍流入市場，且棉製品複製工業之搜購紗綫者，因民營紗廠配紗之更不易得，轉而集中於此，於是表面上不無繁榮之象，實則景象已今非昔比云。</p>
<h3>燃管會主委徐樂天談　上海煤斤調配情況　百分之八十六供給公用事業南美及安南白煤今冬可抵瀘</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕經濟部上海區燃料管理委員會主任委員徐樂天氏，頃接見本報記者·對該會近況·及記者所提詢　問題，解答頗詳，茲分誌如次。渠稱：政府復員伊始，全國各主要礦區，被共軍破壞，全國各地存煤極少。所有產量，不及主要用途百分之三十。同時，運輸方面，極度困難。茍非由政府集中管理，與扶助生產，東南各省之公用事業，鐵路，船舶及各種工業，早已完全停頓。而各礦如無政府主管當局，及本會等健全機構與盡力協助，亦早因材料缺乏，與經濟枯渴，而停止生產。</p>
<p>運煤船舶有十六艘</p>
<p>現本會租用運煤船舶，共達十六艘。分辦事處遍設青島，漢口，廣州等地。運煤主要來源，北爲秦皇島之開採煤礦。每月可運到十三四萬噸。南爲台灣基隆煤礦，每月可運到四五萬噸。他們淮南華東等煤礦，亦可運到小量煤斤。在運輸及商城情形萬分不利之狀態下，本會運輸能力，每月仍可達　餘萬噸。供給區域，除平津外，幾全由本會調配。生產方面，無不竭力扶持各礦增廠。利用對日易貨所得之礦木，盡量開礦產煤。現開　煤礦，每日產煤量已自五千噸，增加至一萬二千噸。台灣基隆每日產煤量，亦自五百噸，增加至三千噸。</p>
<p>東北煤炭明春可來</p>
<p>現所期望者，即東北之　順孚新兩大煤礦，亦可望於最近修復產煤。惟以限於水電之供應，初恢復時，大致每日僅能產煤七千噸。惟冬令轉瞬即屆，東北本身亦需煤孔殷，預期明春始可由餘量供應東南各省。估計大致每月可供應六萬噸至十萬噸。迨東北區恢復大量生產，政局好轉，則全國煤斤問題，即可迎刃而解。</p>
<p>配給價格始終未變</p>
<p>現本會所調配之煤斤，百分之八十六，須供給東南各省之公用事業，鐵路，船舶等。其餘百分之十四，則供給之煤斤價格，始終維持不變。例如供給上海電力公司之煤斤，每噸仍爲三萬餘元。供給兩路局及東南各省電廠之煤斤，每噸仍爲五萬餘元。本會即須負擔購耗二萬元·至百分之十四之工業用煤·以前雖因供應價格之不同，而稍有盈餘，惟目前已無法以之彌補虧耗。在本市方面，就本會所可供應之煙煤及市民炊事應用之白煤屑而言，自本年三月起·經本會用有效措施，予以平壓後，迄今無力再行上漲。</p>
<p>最近白煤漲價原因</p>
<p>至家庭取暖所用白煤塊，黑市之高漲，其原因係因正太路被截斷，山西煤未能外運，（近已恢復通車，但因車輛不敷，運出者仍在少數）。而門頭　煤礦被水淹沒。北方家庭取暖用煤，發生恐慌。於是華北當局，禁止白煤出口，而致造成瀘市白煤短少之現象。惟最近我國正與安南進行物物交換之談判，以我之生絲，易安南之鴻墓白煤。現法國經濟代表國莫氏，會與本人數度洽談，大致可望成功。又南美洲方面，亦可望於今冬以前，運輸抵瀘，俾本市冬令取暖用之煤斤，不致發生恐慌。</p>
<p>統籌統配緊急措置</p>
<p>本會於本年八月間，重訂國內外輸入煤斤暫行管理辦法五點，蓋　於國內地方不靖，各產煤區及運輸路線，時遭破壞，乃不得已採取此項緊急措置，目的無非對全國煤斤，作統籌合理之　配與供應。該五項辦法爲：</p>
<p>（一）本會對於國內外輸人上海區煙白煤，及國內進口焦炭，依本辦法管理之。</p>
<p>（二）國內進口煙煤，統由本會管理。如未經本會核準，擅自採運者，本會應予全部照本會進價收購之。</p>
<p>（三）國內白煤焦炭，獲準商民自由運銷。但須在出口口岸主管機關，申請核發準運證，進口時報請本會查驗，本會於必要時，得照其成本加百分之五利潤收購之。</p>
<p>（四）國外煙白煤進口，須向本會申請核準。如未經核準。自由採運進口者，本會應予全部照本會進價收購之。</p>
<p>（五）國外煙白煤已經核準進口者，本會於必要時，得全部依照核定成本酌加利潤收購之。渠稱：以運煤噸位之大，所需資力之鋸，決并普通商民所能辦到。且商民運到之煤，終以利潤爲先，太多向黑市拋售，必要時決不能犧牲供應公用及焦炭專業。故不得不採行該項統籌辦法，以謀在煤斤供應，未復政策狀態以前，作全面合理之調配。至收買之敗類，原則商均係全部收買。且收買之價格，亦均一律。並無分成數，及等絲價格收買之清彩雲。</p>
<h3>商業銀行舉辦長期低利貸款　需要兩個條件</h3>
<p>（一）不動產可以作担保品</p>
<p>（二）准許重貼現與轉抵押</p>
<p>在目前高利貸壓迫之下，共農商業資金周轉不靈，生產無法維持，此次參議會請顧問普京，會向政府提出調劑工農商業資金之建議，政府當局已在考慮，據金城銀行總經理徐國　氏談：要調劑工農商業資金，必須舉辦長期低利貸款，但此事目前各商業銀行均難辦到，因爲第一銀行準備金數額國鋸，影響放款數額，在目前上海各商業銀行終，存款百億之家爲數無多，而一百億元之銀行，須付各種準備金約六十餘億，又須付存戶利息一十億元，實際商可做放款僅三十億元，以每月利息一角五分計算，利息收入僅有四億五千萬元，而此類銀行每月開支須五億元以上，在此收不敷出情形之下，如何能抑低利息。第二因爲目前大多數存戶均係活期存款，隨時需要準備支付，故銀行不能舉辦長期放款，最多只有一個月，普通爲一周或一間，在此種情形下，貸款者除臨時濟急之外，只有用于投機生意。如慾使商業銀行舉辦長期低利貸款，第一要準許銀行以不動產爲準備，因爲設立準備金之目的，乃爲預防銀行倒閉時以此款發給存款，補償其損失，如是似可不必以現金充任，而以銀行房地產作抵，則銀行流通資金增加。第二，要國家銀行舉辦重貼現與轉抵押，使商業銀行頭寸不敷時，有國家銀行作後盾，如是商業銀行流通資金充足，自可舉辦長期低利貸款，否則，僅是幾個國家銀行舉辦，仍不能滿足工商農業界之需要，必須商業銀行協助國家銀行，方可有濟於事。</p>

<h3>今日開做美鈔　當局在密切注意中</h3>
<p>上週四美鈔市況，因受謠言影響，噸起劇烈變動，市面甚爲混亂，刺激各項物價跟蹤上跳，市政府及重要銀行特訂買賣美鈔臨時辦法三項，即日施行，一面　劃有效對策，澈底取締美鈔黑市投機，同時錢兌業公會亦於是日決議，停止美鈔交易三日，此項限期，近日屆滿，據悉錢兌業方面，已奉貝總裁面諭，今日起恢復美鈔交易，惟須遵守下列三項規定，即買賣不得超過中央銀行公佈對美電匯率再加百分之五之價格，如有抬高收購者，立即報告市政，倘錢兌莊有從中操縱者，亦決予以嚴辦，行政院院長宋子文氏，特於上週末，親借財政部俞部長來瀘，妥謀適當辦法，宋氏於當日抵寓後，即召見中央銀行貝總裁，垂詢本市金融動態，並聽取報告。</p>

<p>大西洋城·人潮洶涌　一年一度選皇后  本報九月廿日紐約航訊　駐美特派員毛樹清　　正是上海小姐選舉以後的二個星期，在綺麗風光的美國大西洋城，有著一年一度的瘋狂的季節，選舉一九四六年度的「美國小姐」。　　人們像潮水一樣湧到這海畔度夏的小城，已經是中秋前不久的日子了，但是，在美國，他們還叫作「仲夏」，美國人的夏天，要到九月二十日才完畢，他們的黃歷，也是根據前華人多人少經騐的結晶才寫成的，不是嗎？皇后選舉揭曉的那天，太陽還像火一般的，照耀著碧藍的海水。　　選舉要連續進行一個星期，在預定的選舉日子以前，各州各特別市的「皇后」，都預先紛紛到達大西洋城。二十多年以來，每年的皇后選舉，必定都在大西洋城舉行。據說常年發起『賽美』的幾位資本家，愛好這小城的景色，因此，就決定了這一塊「勝地」的紅運。我這回從紐約去大西洋城，還是第一次，我不能說那座小城『不可愛』，淸靜，雅緻，成百家以上的避暑的旅館，高潔的戲院和娛樂設備，還有，一腔天然的碧藍海水。曾經有人提議把聯合國的新機構，設在大西洋城，後來，總覺得不及紐約方便，也就擱置了。　　參加競選以女生爲限　　我一直到揭曉前一天，才趕到大西洋城，找旅館就化了相當的力氣，『小姐』們的賽美化裝遊行，我都沒看到，據說，今年的比往年還精彩，她們的行列，橫貫在大西洋城的各條馬路，觀衆像瘋在一樣湧來擠去。歡喜『品頭論足』之徒，就開始預測：芝加哥的個子太小，伊利諾安的太瘦弱，田納西的又太高大……諸如此類，在每個人心目中，都預先有一張底稿，像買了彩票的賭徒一樣，沒有一個觀衆，不期望自己內心的彩票中彩。　　老頭子老太婆也擠著看熱閙，他們把『老光眼鏡』帶起來，不禁嘆惜著：『都是頂刮刮的好姑娘，都漂亮！』　　對的，五十名競選人，沒有一個不漂亮，不漂亮便當選不到各州各特別市的代表，各州初選的嚴格，並不亞於全國總選。按照選舉法的規定，參加美國小姐選舉的僅限於在學的美國女學生，初選以前，各城各鎭的各校女學生，自己認爲够得上『美』的標準的，自動報名，各州初選報名的人歡，多至好幾百人，然後，第一步由醫生檢査體格，像林黛玉式『吐綠痰』有肺病的小姐，縱然長得美，在體格檢査一關下便告洶汰，其次是看身體高及寬，肥胖體重的數字是否勻稱，身段長瘦而超過『苗條』的限度者，或是身段矮胖而超過『豐滿』的限度者，都在第二步淘汰下去了。第三步才看面相，看肌膚，這樣經過審美專家及體格檢査的醫師初選複選以後，已經淘汰了一大半。十一位小姐參加最後決賽　上臺表演妙技　　八月中旬我去華盛頓，大使館的秘書林啓智兄，邀我去看電影，無意之中，剛巧碰到華盛頓特別市的最後決賽，最後決賽有十一位小姐，每位上合表演『盛裝』，『淡裝』，以及走路的姿勢，所謂盛裝，是穿著長袖大服，像中國的古裝美女，所謂淡裝，則是露出大腿及胸圍，表演美國婦女的所謂『曲線』，然後，每個人做一樣娛樂，唱歌，或跳舞，或奏鋼琴都可，看羣衆鼓掌的程度，愛好那一個？評判員是九位，四位是當地的新聞記者，一位音樂專家，一位審美專家，還有兩位，大槪是華盛頓市的『聞人』。　　華盛頓州的初選決賽，評判員差不多完全遵照羣衆鼓掌的程度，那天，珍妮，卡爾遜小姐穿了一身黑紗衣，戴一頂農家的笠帽，唱一支非常『調皮』的歌曲；美國人非常愛聽的：『做吧，順其自然的做罷！』她兩手抓住笠精的邊緣，頭一伸一伸的非常逗人眷愛，至少，在美國人的眼光中，是對她愛戴極了。結果，珍妮，卡爾遜當選。但是，在全國大選的時候，卡爾遜却不堪輕輕一擊，在初選中就被淘汰了。全國大選，今年參加的五十一人，四十八州，三特別市，（事實上，美國無所謂特別市，因此，每年大選的候選人，人數並不一樣）。五十一人之中，前五天初選，選出十六名，然後在十六名之中，再選五名，最後由五名之中，躍選登峯造極的皇后。一九四五年皇后與今年競選人合影（特派員毛樹淸寄）　　「美國小姐」競選前之化裝游行（特派員毛樹清寄）　　本年當選之「美國小姐」（本報特約紐約時報攝寄）　　全體競選美女（特派員毛樹淸寄）孫俞黎利利　前臺工作·借攝外景　　選舉在大西洋城公共大會黨舉行，這是一座可容十餘萬人的大會堂，那一年造的？我無暇深究，是否專爲每年一度的皇后選舉而造，也不得而知。反正，這是一個非常合適的塲所，來排塲這一類人間佳話。我參觀最後決賽的那天，觀衆有三萬多人，祗運用了大會堂的一半，後半節全是空的，門票分訂座和普通座二類，訂座類之中，又分十元券，六元券，五元券及二元五角券，中國觀衆中，有鄭用之先生，及大導演孫瑜，演員黎莉莉他們，因爲借此塲合拍攝「外景」，都在台前工作，台前看美女，也看得淸楚些，後面的觀衆，如果忘了携帶「望遠鏡」，那眞是一件天大的「憾事」。　　舞台是法國歌劇院的建築，半圓形的舞台面，巾間有一條堤，像黃浦灘上的碼頭一樣，伸到會堂的中央，每位候選人，要繞臺一週，然後再到那『堤』上巡禮一過，這樣，使後排及左右兩邊的觀衆，有機會『欣賞』得淸楚一點。舞台的佈景，是一幅『蓬萊仙境」，五十一位美女，淡裝濃抹，分坐在淸泉流水的亂石之上，去年（一九四五）的皇后，戴皇冠，穿皇后大氅，坐在正中，這塲面硬是有點巍峨偉觀。然後當選十六名，淡裝，盛奘，表演走路姿勢，彼此互相談話，看談話的姿勢。最後表演歌與舞。路易西安那小姐的歌喉，不下於影星珍妮麥唐納，全塲爲之驚倒，但是，皇后的條件，不僅是唱歌面已。猶泰州小姐的一動一靜，沒有觀衆不認爲很够『甜』，但是皇后的條件，不禁是「甜」而已。有一州的小姐（那州，我忘了），不會歌舞，在合上表演繪畫，原因是她是一位畫家，一位藝專的學生，最後當選的一九四六皇后加利福尼亞小姐，不唱歌，不跳舞，也不繪畫，她祗在台上說了一段加利福尼亞的笑話，但是，她當選了。加州姑娘光榮入選　天下大局一定　鼓掌熱烈擁戴　　最後決賽的五位是：加利福尼亞小姐，阿蘭泰州小姐，阿根薩斯州小姐，路易西安娜小姐和猶泰小姐。坐在我四週的一大羣美國觀衆，他們品頭論足的結論，是二分之一，贊成阿根薩斯州小姐，因爲她身段最勻稱，其餘二分之一，贊成猶泰州小姐，因爲她的一動一靜，或嫣然一笑，實在够得上稱爲『甜』，但是，結果揭曉了，臺下人有一度喧嘩起來。　　一個民主政治有訓練的國家，處處泛露著一種『民主』的素養，他們絕對相信評判員的公平無私，天下大局一決定，他們便熱誠爲加利福尼亞小姐慶賀鼓掌，第二天，一九四六年的『美國小姐』，在大西洋城駕車出遊，並且在一家最大的旅館門前，被攝影師，攝影記者圍著照相，觀衆們在『光天化日』之下，才眞正的看到了廬山眞面目，前天晚上不服氣的觀衆，都禁不住叫絕：『評判先生的眼光不錯，硬是要得！』　　今年度的評判員有十三位，據說全是美國第一流的『審美專家』，有五位是四十左右的婦人，她們在年輕時代，也有過不少光榮的回憶，現在她們有的是大戲院的董事長，有的是大公司服裝的設計主任，也有的是音樂的聖手。男評判員九位，也是一條路子的人，他們畢生的職業，都是硏究什麼叫『美』？他們和那些天眞爛漫的女學生，都沒有一絲一毫的利害關係。從此天下父母心　不重生男重生女　　參加競選的，限於全國的女學生，電影明星和職業婦女，都沒有資格，正如同體育敎員，沒有資格參加運動會一樣，還有一條規則，是前一屆的『皇后』不能再參加競選。揭曉那晚上，一九四五年皇后，（紐約小姐），當時就把『皇冠』及『皇袍』褪下，給新選出的一九四六年皇后（加利福尼亞小姐）加冕，然後，新舊皇后接吻，全塲十熱烈的鼓掌，　　宣佈結果的前數分鐘，主席介紹『美國小姐』的四位發起人上台，四位都是大資本家，幾十家公司和工廠的老闆，這四位大腹賈，每年向例要露面一次。他們發起選『美國小姐』，遠在二十五年以前，他們四位捐了一筆鉅額基金，提取每年的利息二萬五千元，作爲美女的獎學金，當選『美國小姐』的，獨得五千元，專門指定作獎勵求學用的，其餘一千元，五百元，下等。競選人總是『皆大歡喜』。每年的門票收入也十分可觀，一部份用作排塲及開支，其餘的捐充公益事業。　　記者們問今年當選的『美國小姐』，道五千元作什麽用？她回答得很好：『我是從世界的電影聖地洛杉機來的，我預備將這五千元獎學金，作爲硏究戲劇，學習戲劇之用』，和皇后一起來的同伴們說：皇后有志於電影和戲劇，她將來一定獻身於藝術界」。　　二十五年來，每年當選的皇后，都有紀錄，紐約，費城，華盛頓，加利福尼亞，比較多，內地深山中的比較少。皇后的愛好都不同，有的愛戲劇，有的愛運動，去年一九四五的『美國小姐』，愛彈鋼琴。但是據說：有一點是非常相同的，便是：每一屆的皇后，都做了資本家的太太或兒媳。貧窮人家的女兒，一朝當選了『皇后』，便有很　　愛，求婚的信，來自瓊樓朱門的闊少。大西洋城的熱閙，片刻即逝，但是：『從此天下父母心，不重生男重生女，」這在美國社會的無形的影響，實在是不可思議的！增強動人溫暖人心　發展東北煤產  九月十五日瀋陽航訊　本報特派員韓清濤　　九月的東北，已經從西伯利亞吹來了冷風，人們馬上感到即將有寒風刺骨的襲擊！　　手頭充裕的人們，在加緊購辦煤炭，準備着對付可怕的難關。沒錢的人們，看到了人家一大車一大車往家買，自己呢，却瞪着眼，乾着急。　　好多工廠的烟囪，等着它冒烟，好多的機器等着它轉動，更有好多的火車頭吼着要煤　，嚴寒裏的人們，更在顫動着凍僵了的雙手，要它來溫暖。　　可是光復後了的東北，今年冬天，煤却成了問題。原來，煤礦多被破壞了，機械多不完整了，更因電力不充足，支撑土層的木柱沒着落，掘不出大量的煤炭，所以發生了令人惶恐的騷擾。　　敵僞竭澤而漁　煤炭產量不夠　　嚴重的煤荒問題在醖釀了，東北的人們都在談這個問題了，東北物資調節委員會，爲了這個問題，特招待了一次記者，報吿了一些東北煤炭供求槪况。　　東北各省的煤炭產量，因爲過去日本挾其雄資和技術，經十二年的經營，到了民國三十三年，曾達二千八百七十五萬噸，但因日人專注意軍用，對於各礦盡量採掘，無暇顧及維護工作，因之工程和設備，都陷入衰頽狀態。　　像撫順，在民國二十五年，年產達九百萬噸，其後逐年减少，至民國三十三年，年產只剩四百萬噸，可見其竭澤而漁的情形。　　八一五光復後，連遭蘇方拆去機械，又遭共方破壞，各煤礦生產技能損失在百分之七十以上，等到經濟部派員接收時，像機器，骰備，材料，組辨，電源等，均陷於不可收拾的地位。　　據說接收調査整理之後，煤的生產量，現已逐漸恢復，最近撫順，阜新，西安，烟合各礦，每月產量除自用外，尙餘十六萬噸左右，可供給鐵路全部和民用的一部，若再求增產，以期民用不致過缺，必須先行解決三項問題：就是（一）電力充份供應，（二）材料充足，（三）增强機器和管理力量。　　需要多價錢局　煤荒情勢嚴重　　在煤的需要上，鐵路月需十萬噸，其他像瀋陽，遼陽，鞍山，營口，錦州，錦西，四平，長春，吉林等處，每月平均需要二十萬噸，兩共三十萬噸，故預計本年九月至十二月最低需要量爲一百二十萬噸。　　八月中旬，曾由經濟委員會約集經濟部代表和各礦負責人在瀋會議，討論增產計劃，當將各礦所需資金，按照各礦希望照撥，並將木材，炸藥，及其他各種材料，於可能範圍內，設法搜購，並決定增產後，各礦除自用外，供給量爲：九月二十萬噸，十月二十三萬噸，十一月二十四萬噸，十二月二十八萬噸，共九十五萬噸。　　照上述計劃增產後，可能供給的煤量較之最低需要量，迄至本年十二月止，尙差二十五萬噸。但沿路和山上積存煤炭，估計總在十萬噸左右，可爲補充。如此，截至今年十二月止，尙差十五萬噸。各方面電源如能增加，此項差數不難補足。但，計劃是計劃，今天的問題，是怎樣才能趕快把計劃實現。　　煤價高漲，考其原因，不外兩種：（一）因煤炭產量减少，（二）因鐵路運輸困難，加以雨季，道路濘泥，大車運費增加，因此，煤價與日俱增，七月三十一日每噸煤價爲流通券五千元，八月十日漲至入千元，長春市於是日到達一萬元，煤荒情形十分嚴重。　　現山調節會與各礦硏究結果，其辦法：（一）按照煤炭開採成本售於調節會，（二）調節會除前項成本外，加上鐵路運價，裝卸費用，棧租，稅款，利息，警衛，管理，各種損耗等等開支，（三）加煤炭商銷煤及運送等開支，（四）酌提公積金，礦山所需糧食及材料等將來漲價的貼補，現每月經委會貼補各礦開支流通券約七八千萬元，照上述四項因素，規定煤價如下：即一噸煤炭（內半噸塊煤，半噸粉煤）市價爲五千元，故市面塊煤每噸定價爲五千八百元，粉煤四千二百元。　　在破壞裏建設　加緊發掘工作　　各省市氣候不同，採煖用煤的數量亦異，現先就瀋陽市着想，以全市人口作爲一百二十萬人計算，各方對於分配數量的意見，每人每日炊膳及取煖均以二市斤計算，則九·十·兩月份各用煤三萬六千噸，十一·十二·兩月份各用煤七萬二千噸，四個月共計二十一萬六千噸，超過一萬六千噸。　　煤炭缺乏，發生許多阻礙和不安，收復區是這樣，共軍駐在區域裏的情形，更是嚴重，大連缺乏燃料，砍伐風景樹林和菓樹當柴燒，就是一個很好的例證。物資調節委員會所估計的，是針對着收復區。至於共軍區域，現在還沒法弄明白，不過煤荒確很嚴重。　　東北北部的大森林，是名聞於世的，木料的出產，數字當然很驚人。松花江上木料飄浮，蔚爲大觀，火車頭燒木料，更是罕見，但是煤之產量，是大大的相形見絀了。　　松花江北岸鬧煤荒，木料過剩，遼吉等省煤量不足，木料也缺乏。炭坑需要木料支撑，開礦需要大宗木料，打算增加煤產，必須大規模開煤礦，聽說爲了調劑盈虛，收復區和共軍區，雙方將訂立一個以煤換木和以木換煤的臨時協定。　　去年冬天，東北各地，動力和禦寒，多半仰賴存　，今年需要在殘缺和破壞裏建設，發掘，以解決煤荒，溫暖人心，發揮動力！東北產煤區獵影　東北社攝　　（上）撫順煤礦遠景（下）撫順煤礦周圍的拾煤老羣。據熟悉此項生活者云：彼等每日往返四五次，每人每次可拾七八十拾斤。當局爲顧念貧民生計，目下尙無禁例。此在煤礦方面，損失當匪淺鮮。東北抗戰名將孔憲榮將軍  吉林九月十五日航訊　　初秋之東北，天朗氣淸，已是凉風颯颯了。記者隨着歡迎者之一羣，驅車至車站，恭迎九一八抗日名將孔憲榮老將軍來吉。　　查孔氏現任吉遼安三省邊區總指揮兼第二支隊司令，晋爲陸軍中將。此次奉令駐節吉林，收編舊部，安定邊區，早爲民衆所渴望。　　孔氏於九月十五日午後三十分由長春率部專車抵吉林車站，到站歡迎者有紳，商，農各界代表及吉東十數縣民衆代表數百名，列隊恭迎。孔氏下車後，與歡迎者含笑答禮致謝，旋即登車至行轅，沿途市民，鵠立爭先，鼓掌歡呼，迎迓此民族奮鬥之老將軍，空氣熱烈空前。　　記者同車抵行轅，孔氏暢談今後抱負，決本中央意旨，誓死爲民族奮鬥到底，肅淸奸匪，安定民生，以期完成統一建國之使命。　　孔氏爲山東費縣人，雖年逾花甲，精神尙健。九一八事變時，任東北救國軍副司令。廿二年春，彈盡援絕，退入蘇聯，經歐返國，復再潛入僞滿，指揮義勇軍與日寇抵抗。廿四年再歸國內。廿七年發動山東民衆抗戰。廿九年經中央派爲東北黨務特派員，途經上海，被敵僞逮捕，監禁五年，受盡威脅利誘，始終不屈，終於八一五國家勝利，始恢復自由，經中樞及杜長官任命現職。　　孔將軍對於長白山岳地帶之匪區作戰，具有相當之把握，蓋所有該地武裝同志，均係孔氏舊　。現在各地潛伏之實力，已蜂起相應，刻正集結行使中。其已點編者，約有三萬餘衆，在不久的將來，定可掃除匪氛，使大好河山不致破碎，使苦難同胞臻於安居樂業之境。（上海社）江西工鑛業的喘息  本報廿八日九江訊　韓鳴　　從都市裏初上牯嶺的人們，除了感到涼爽的舒適以外，都盛讚山中的霧景和清靜，它代替了都市中的煤烟和煩囂，淸晨推開窗子，霧便像窗簾似的白濛濛地一片掛在窗前，晚來靜寂更佔有了全嶺。這時候，羣峯皆睡，除了電廠的馬達發出軋軋的聲響以外，沒有一點其他的雜音。　　老工程師的感喟　　一夕，記者在一個友人的宴會上，大家談起在山中的感想。我說：「目前在中國，有都市的享受而又兼有太平鄕村淸幽味的地方恐怕只有牯嶺吧！現在這裏不僅是「和平的搖籃」，而且也是工業的「眞空」。旁席一位客人接着道：「也許目前的江西在工業上還是一塊未開墾的土地哩」！　　這一句話，却引起座中一位戰時曾在江西工作多年的老工程師的抗議，他從嘴邊拉下他那粗黑的煙斗：　　「戰前談到工業，江西眞像一個頑劣的小學生，在全國工業統計數字上，它老是落在後面，可是抗戰却激勵它進步了，戰事初起的幾年間，重工業與輕工業在贛西南一帶都建立了一些基礎，可是這新懇地上的幾株工業的幼苗在勝利的前夕便被敵人的砲火摧殘了！它只在戰時曇花一現，今天是什麽都完了！剩下的機器也大半睡在廠裏生銹」！他說時，中心似有無限的感喟，隨即道：「但過去爲它費了相當精力的人們，却總不甘讓它就此夭折，所以我在這幾個月內搜集了一些有關江西工鑛損失的資料，準備有機會向當局報吿，以作復興的參考，希望當局不要讓它自生自滅」！　　曇花一現的工業　　記者聽完他一席話，望着這位工程師紅紅的面龐和那粗壯的手臂，深感建國的前途，並不一定在紙面上洋洋大觀的計劃，倒有賴於這些實幹人才的毅力與精神。從這些實際工作者談話中所得的資料，也許比一般的報吿更眞實，餐後便和它攀談起來，而他也很直爽地打開了　匣子：　　「民國二十九年到三十一年，可說是江西工業欣欣向榮的時期，重工業方面有資源委員會與省政府合辦的機器，鍊鐵，車船，電工，硫酸五個廠，機器，電工，車船三廠都設在戰時的省會泰和，規模雖不很大，但肝膽俱全。煉鐵廠設在吉安永新之間的天河鎭，機器和鍋爐都還完備，並且舖設了五公里的鋼軌。硫酸廠的廠址則設在大庾，當時採用的是最新釻全接觸方法，每月大槪可製98％濃度硫酸四噸。還有資源委員會，華中水泥廠與省政府合辦的水泥廠也在天河，採用乾法豎窰製造，佔計每年可出水泥八〇〇〇桶，每桶約一七〇公斤，民國三十三年敵軍先後竄進贛西與贛南各縣，這幾個廠的房屋，機器便十分之九都毀於敵人之手了。損失至少在四萬萬元以上。今年春天，資源委員會打算將餘下的器材全部撥歸省政府接收，可是省政府那有如此雄厚的經濟力量來復工呢？目前便只有讓它擱淺！　　「至於輕工業，有省營的興業公司的酒精，糖，織染，麻織，製革，鋸木，瓷，印刷等十一個廠。結果也是因爲敵軍幾次竄擾而被破壞，現在只剩下一個印刷廠，可以勉强營業。民營的有火柴，罐頭，紡織，印刷幾十個廠，亦都一起損失，就是景德鎭的瓷窰，原有一百五十餘座，由於戰時遭受敵機轟炸，業已損失大半，現在開工的還不及三分之一」。　　「此外公用事業，全省本有電廠二十三家，南昌，吉安，泰和，大庾，贛縣爲省營，其餘都是民營，勝利以後，除南昌水電廠收回外，省營四廠所受的損失合計在一萬萬元以上，因此泰和，大庾兩廠只有停辦，吉贛兩廠目前亦只是勉强掙扎，民營各廠，只有九江勉力維持，其餘都已停工」。　　「總之，江西的工業，是在戰時土壤中生長的一支蓓蕾，可是它終於經不起戰爭暴風雨的摧殘，什九都毀了！以上我所說的不過是一個大槪，關於確實的損失，我有一個相當詳細的數字，假使您需要的話，可以送給你參考」。　　從數字上來分析　　以下便是它供給記者的一個統計數字：　　（一）重工業方面　　一·江西機器廠：年產木炭爐五〇套，汽缸蓋六〇隻，五金零件二〇〇〇件，戰時損失八八·〇〇〇·〇〇〇元，現已停頓，最近擬由江西公路處接辦。　　二·江西煉鐵廠：年產翻砂鐵七二〇〇噸，戰時損失三五·〇〇〇·〇〇〇元，現已停頓，暫由天河煤礦接收保管。　　三·江西車船廠：年產中型淺水客輪，淺水拖船各一艘，帆船六艘，蒸汽機二部，蒸汽鍋爐一座，戰時損失二八·八〇〇·〇〇〇元現已辦理結束。　　四·江西電工廠：年產電池（甲）七二〇〇只，電池（乙）二〇〇〇只，單節電池一〇〇〇〇打，收發報機一五部，磁石式話機五〇部，擴音機二部，戰時損失六〇·六〇〇·〇〇〇元，現已停頓，擬由江西省無綫電總隊接辦。　　五·江西酸廠：年產98％濃度琉酸四〇頓，戰時損失三二·五〇〇〇元，現已辦理結束。　　六·江西水泥廠：年產水泥八〇〇〇桶，戰時損失二〇〇·〇〇〇·〇〇〇元，共計損失四一三·四〇〇·〇〇〇元。　　（二）輕工業方面　　一·萍鄉瓷廠：年產電瓷及各種瓷器二八七·八九九件，戰時損失九·三五三·六二〇元，現已停頓。　　二·江西印刷廠：年產鉛印品一四·八三九頁，石印品二二八四六頁，製版一九四塊，戰時損失四八·三四四·五六〇元，現繼續辦理已改組爲江西興業出版公司。　　三·贛縣酒精廠：年產動力酒精一五二·八二五加侖，戰時損失一四八·九一四·三五三元，現已停頓。　　四·贛縣製革廠：年產各種面皮二九八三〇方尺，皮箱皮革三九五八只，戰時損失三·〇九九·四八〇元，現已停頓。　　五·贛縣糖廠：年產各種白糖一九二四担，拮水糖二·四九八担，戰時損失二二·五一八·四三七元，現已停頓。　　六·贛縣蔴織廠：年產蔴布一二五〇〇〇嗎，蔴袋一八〇，〇〇〇個，戰時損失二一，一五三，三八五元，現已停頓。　　七·贛縣紡織染廠：年產各色布疋六十萬嗎，印花布疋三十萬嗎，戰時損失五八，九八二，五〇八元，現已停頓。　　八·贛縣機器廠：修製器械，戰時損失三九，八三〇，四三二元，現已停頓。　　九·贛縣鋸木廠：年鋸建築材料一三，〇〇〇方，戰時損失八八，一〇三，二六〇元，現已停頓。　　共計損失四四〇，三〇〇，〇三五元。　　（三）公用事業　　一·南昌水電廠：每年發電二，六四〇，〇〇〇度，水六，〇七三，四〇〇加侖，現繼續辦理　　二·贛縣電廠：每年發電二，一六五，七七三度，戰時損失七〇，七三四，八七五元，現機續辦理。　　三·吉安電廠：每年發電一八〇，九〇四度，戰時損失三一，九二五，〇三一元，現繼續辦理　　四·泰和電廠：每年發電九〇，八六六度，戰時損失二〇，七九三，二三二元，現已停辦。　　五·大庾電廠：每年發電一二，三五六度，戰時損失四，九九四，八四二元，現已停辦。　　六·江西度量衡檢定所附設工廠，年產度量衡器三，八〇〇件，戰時損失三三，三一九，〇〇〇元，準備復工。　　共計損失一六一，七六放，九八〇元。　　重工業，輕工業，公用事業各廠總計損失一，〇一五，四六七，〇一五元正。　　四·急待恢復開採的豐富礦　　　我們在一種悼惜的情緒中，沉默了半晌，隨即又將話題轉到江西的礦業損失方面。　　礦業方面的損失　　「說到江西的礦產，在東南各省中，天賦並不算差。就說鎢礦吧，產區便有大庾，龍南，虔南，會昌，安遂，　都，泰和等十七縣，儲藏量達四〇〇萬噸左右，佔世界第一位。初由人民自由開採，自民國廿五年國營以來，大庾等七個主要礦區，每年產量即有一〇萬噸，差不多都是運銷國外。錫礦區亦在大庾，南康，上猶一帶，儲藏量約一〇萬噸，其中大庾產量最多，初由省府設廠採煉，年產量約一五〇〇噸，二十九年移歸國營，三十三年敵人由粤北竄入贛南，奪取鎢礦也是他的戰略目標之一。後來敵人由贛南沿江北竄時，果然裝了無數船的鎢砂沿贛江而下，帶不走的，敵人自然盡力破壞，所以目前大庾的鎢礦，可說是破壞得一塌糊塗了，一時開工不了。　　「其次，樂平的猛礦儲藏量約有一百萬噸，僅次於湖南。自主十一年一月起，省府設廠開採，每月可產錳砂錳粉各三〇噸，　平在抗戰八年中雖未倫陷，但簡接遭受敵寇竄擾的影響，礦廠亦無法維持，早已停止開採。　　「至於工業方面少不了的煤和鐵，煤產區如萍鄉，餘干，豐城，宜春，樂平，吉安，新喩，上饒等縣，總儲藏量約七億噸，從事開採以來，公私經營都有，每年產量約在八〇萬噸以上。戰前南潯，浙贛兩路，本省各電廠與贛江輪船都靠本省的產煤供給，其中以萍鄕安源與吉安永新之間天河的煤最著名。敵軍竄入江西時，安源煤礦即已停止開採，現在正準備改組，可是還未開工。天河煤礦戰時產量每年還都有增加，後來吉泰淪陷，便只有全部停頓了。　　「江西的鐵礦，萍鄉，蓮花，永新，九江，寧都都有，據一般的估計，全省儲藏量約二〇〇〇萬噸，其中以永新烏石山的質量最好，過去只是小規模開採，二十九年省政府與資源委員會合辦煉鐵廠於天河，便是以附近烏石山的鐵砂爲主要原料，三十一年起，每天可出翻砂鐵二〇噸，三十三年敵人竄擾贛西，經過天河，煤礦自然亦遭受了很大的損失」！　　「總而言之，我們如從江西的礦藏量來看，不但足够建立大規模的輕重工業，而且可以換取鉅額的外匯，現在如能早一天復工，國富與省財源的增加固然不成問題，同時還可解決一般工礦技工的失業問題，說起來，這眞是一個最根本的善後工作。」　　我們談到這裏，佇望窗外滿天星斗，已是夜闌人靜的辰分了，牯嶺已在沉沉的夜色中，記者辭謝了主人，同時握別這位有心的建國鬥士道：　　『謝謝您供給我這許多寳貴的資料。祝福國家還能給您一個機會，能使江西各地的煙囪比廬山的羣峯更要巨大，煤烟比山中的曉霧還要濃密

<p>生產建設每星期一出版	中國經濟建設  方顯庭博士講　閭叔銘記　　方顯庭博士於九月廿七日在滬江大學演講，題爲「中國經濟建設」。方博士戰前曾任南開大學商學院院長，後任研究院院長，此次戰時任美國戰時生產局顧問，現任中央設計局專員。方博士對於經濟建設頗具卓見，聞已擬就我國經濟建設五年計劃，該題所述，乃其五年計劃之大概，現記述於後，以供各界參考。　　現在我們談建設，必須要有先決條件，而經濟建設的先決條件有二：　　一·國際間的和平——我們大家都知道現在世界大勢，動盪不定，伊朗，巴爾幹半島和外蒙古等均呈着不定的狀態，蘇聯正不斷地在增加它本身的力量，而美國也正致力於工業的發展，英美在技術上確比蘇聯優良，但是蘇聯向上進取的力量亦很可觀，照目前的情形看起來，英國正向社會主義的道路邁進着，這結果將使機會均等，這是一種很好的現象。　　二·國內必須統一民主——若欲國內統一民主，必須國共立即停戰。　　總之以上二個先決條件，對於經濟建設很有關係，若國際間能够和平，國內能够統一民主，那末才可以談經濟建設。　　現在我們先來談談經濟建設的意義，試看目前世界上的强國富國，都是工業化的國家，它們非但研究如何發展工業，並且還把工業的技術和組織，應用到農業，交通，金融上去，我們常常所談的農業工業化，交通工業化，並不是矛盾的，就是應用工業技術，組織到農業交通上去。　　我國經濟建設的目標有三：　　一·軍費應减至最低限度——軍備在國防上固然重要，但是像現在這麼多的軍隊，實在要不得，國家大部份的財政支出都化費在內戰上，請問是否値得？所以想法减低軍費用於經濟建設上。　　二·建立工業化初步基礎——美國在戰時期間，年產鋼鐵九千萬噸，我國當然不能與美國比較，所以必須先建立工業化的初步基礎。　　三·提高人民的健康——這一點也可說是最基本的，因爲我國人民的健康，實在太差，死亡的平均數，英美兩國都在六七十歲以上，而我國並無統計，大約祇有廿五歲，相差得那麼多，所以提高人民的健康很重要。　　目前眞是千頭萬緒，事事都待建設，所以我們不得不精細計算，何者必要，何者次要，中央設計局所設計的經濟建設，可分爲六大門類：一，交通，二，動力，三，工業，四，礦產，五，農林，六，水利，茲分述於後：　　一，交通——交通的重要，與經濟，文化，軍事都有密切的關係，所以發展交通，實刻不待緩，設訐中之交通建設，預計完成鐵路一四，〇〇〇公里，公路六，〇〇〇公里，水運應有一，七五〇，〇〇〇噸，其他如空運，郵政，電信，亦將次第發展。　　二，動力——有交通必須有動力，而動力最重要的是煤和石油，現在計劃中的YVA倘能實現，則可以發電一千萬瓦特，可說是動力的最大發源地。　　三，工業——我國工業落後，所以此次經濟建設，注重於製造機器工其，汽車，輸船工業，其他如電氣工業，化學工業，亦很重要。　　四，礦產——我國雖寳藏萬千，但是開採的極少，所以發展我國固有的礦產如鎢銻等，均屬重要。　　五，農林（包括漁牧）——我國向來以農立國，然而國內常鬧着飢荒，食糧仍須仰給國外，究其原因，實因種植增加熱量的食物太多，所以應該改變農產物的性質，着重於種植增加保護量之食物。　　六，水利——應有人爲的力量統製它，使其不致氾濫或乾涸，水利並包括航運，例如怎樣可使大洋輪船直達重慶。　　現在再談到上述經濟建設的經費與人力，我們按照戰前幣制估計，需款二百念二萬萬元或美金七十一萬萬元，此款須全國人民在五年之內不許消費，才能積成。但是事實上不可能這樣做，所以本人的意思，惟有借外資的一途，我們知道任何一國的經濟建設，必須有他國之帮助，例如美向英借款，加拿大向美借款，世界上不依賴他國而建設的祇有蘇聯，資本借到之後應該完全用於生產建設，絕對不可用於戰爭，而人民應站在監督的地位，帮助政府完成經齊建設之目的。　　至於經費的分配，交通佔百分之三十九，工業佔百分之二十六，礦產佔百分之十一，動力佔百分之十四，水利佔百分之七，農業佔百分之三，其次再談到人力，估計需有五百萬人，其中工人四百五十萬，技術人員五十萬人。　　結論：欲達到經濟建設之目的，必須：　　一，集體安全—確保世界和平。　　二，統一民主—確保國內和平，　　三，計劃建設—長期打算和造就人才。G．E．電氣公司工程師於實騐室中工作　赫德蘭談中國農工業  鐘德祺譯　　本文作者赫德蘭（G.W.Hedland），為美國名農業經濟學家，曾於民國廿五年來華講學，翌年返國，此文雖爲指示金大農經系今後應如何協助工業化工作，但間接則爲對中國工業化問題，及學術團體，機關在工業化中應作工作之意見，今特譯出，以供讀者參考。　譯者附誌　　我在中國的經騐，僅僅是一九三六—三七年中不到一年的時間，以我這短促的經騐，和當時事實的早已變化，都不允許我來建議該系（譯者按：指金大農經系）的未來工作，但我這樣作了！即使我的建議是完全錯誤，我還有熱忱。　　我以爲像中國這樣人口稠密的國家，農業的發展，大都有待於工業的發展，除非有些人已經找到了其他謀生之路，大羣農民是不能得到大的田塲的，改良農有人可以辯駁我說，工業化要等到農業效率可使人民不再需要生產食品而有利的從事其他工作的時候，這事實就是工業要依賴農業，反之亦然。這種建議，到底那樣應該在前呢？那就和先鷄先蛋的爭論一樣了！　　雖然工業化的需要是大家所公認的，我仍要建議該系設法增加一些有關這類的東西，如果過去並沒有這樣作的話，爲或者可以視爲走出她的園地，無疑的，其他的人已經在從事這個問題。但這問題太大，故在這工作上不會作到好多事情。關於怎樣着手那些工作，我沒有任何有價値的建議。或者那些工作可從調查一定地方的工業化的最有希望的方面着手。至於我，以爲很多工業化應該在鄉村中，甚至家庭中實現。使耕作的農民多熟悉這些，應該是站在有利地位，指出中國走向更高度工業化生產的道路。收集廢銅碎鐵入熔爐：配以純金屬即成合金維絨Vinyon  紹　　戰後紡織界最驚人的發展，恐怕無過於純正合成纖維之工業化的成功了，尼隆（Nylon）和維絨（vinyon）是美國兩種極有價値的收獲，關於「尼隆」本欄上期尙衍亮君已有文略加介紹，現在就將「維絨」的大概加以叙述，以餉讀者。　　「維絨」是由乙烯樹指（Vinylite　resin）製成，而乙烯樹指乃是從煤膏和空氣的成份做成的，再加以幾種化學鹽類爲補助，所以「維絨」可說爲純正的人造纖維，不過和的去幾種人造纖維用廢棉木屑等天然纖維素做原料不過把纖維素製成另一形狀而已。　　「維絨」現已由美國的（Carbide　and　Carbon）化學工業社加以大量生產，製品也有生絲和短絨兩種，而「維絨」的織物爲雨衣，襯衫，襪子，帳幕以及縫綫等其纖度較眞細及尼隆還細。「維絨」原料乙烯樹脂的製造是將氯化烯封關於玻璃試管里，受日光作用，乃有一種白色固體發生，由此啓示，乃逐漸製成適用的乙烯樹脂，其化學性質極穩定，對於無機和碱却有强大的抵抗力，物理性質則富有應變力，而「維絨」之拉力和彈力亦可在乙烯樹能製造時日光作用之時間多寡而加以增减。　　「維絨」之性質爲有强度的光澤然如不需要光亮則可加少許微粒不透明物質於沾液中以掩蔽之有充分之防水性所以它潮濕時的拉力和彈力與乾燥時並無顯著大小差異這就是和一般人造纖維不同的特點其比較如下表所示：　　類別　乾拉力（公分丹）　乾延度（％）　　蠶絲　四，二二　十六　　人造絲　二，〇〇　八十　　維絨甲　一，〇〇　一二〇　　維絨乙　二，三〇　二五　　類別　濕拉力（公分丹）　濕延度（％）　　蠶絲　三，四〇　二六　　人造絲　一，〇〇　二八　　維絨甲　一，〇〇　一二〇　　維絨乙　二，三〇　二五工商管理概論  徐百益　　成本會計與簿記　　生產機構問題之六　　任何一個工廠的製造成本，都是記錄在帳簿上的，因此就有人會發問，終究成本會計與薄記有什麼分別，這一點，可以作如下的解釋；　　大約言之，成本會計與簿記是功用上的不同，當你請一個簿記員去做成本會計的時候，他可以實行，他可以把成本計算起來，然而他所做的工作，不能充分表現成本會計的功效，因爲一個簿記員的工作是去記錄一個企業或工廠的經濟狀况，一個成本會計員的工作，那末是要追求那些金錢收付的理由，一個薄記員是對於財政狀况的一個監督者，一個成本會計員是要做更具體的工作，使一個企業能够獲得更多的利潤。　　爲了這幾個理由，一個成本會計員，必須知道製造各方面的各種基本原理，他也應該知道工廠裏採用的製造方法。　　成本的分類　　要做成一種貨品，原料和工資是不能缺少的，但在這兩種必要成分之外，還有一種，那就是日常的開支了，所以每一件貨品的成本，可以說是包括：原料，工資，和開支，原料方面有進貨的記錄可查，工資方面，有付出的工資帳可以查考，除此以外的費用，那末就應該列入開支帳，在實行成本會計的時候，爲原則上的分類方法是不可不知道的。　　但開支帳列入貨品成本的時候，一定要很平均的分布，譬如說一家工廠製造三四種貨品，那末這開支帳，就要用幾種貨品平均或是看着貨品的情形而負担。　　開支帳包括的幾種日常開支　　在列入開支帳中的幾種日常開支現在不妨列舉如下：　　A監督的費用：在許多工廠裏，需要用專門監督工作進行的人員，這無疑地就是一筆開支，如工人們能夠自動地努力工作，那末就可以减少這種人員的數目所有的開支，也可以較爲節省了。　　B管理人員的薪給：在有許多規模較大的組織裏有許多管理人員，他們的薪給也是一種負担，而足以增加貨品的成本的。　　C房租或利息：這兩種放在一起是因爲牠們有相連的關係，譬如說，一家製造廠是借了錢來建造廠房的，那末雖則不必付房租，但必須付利息，這利息就等於是付房租（當然在帳目上是要隨着各家不同的情形而規定爲房租或利息的）　　D保險和捐說：這是差不多每一個企業組織都有的一種開支。　　E折舊：關於折舊的重要，已經在企業課本中詳細說明　　F耗損：在製造廠裏，往往有做壞的貨品，不能出售，但原料和工資，是照樣要付出的，道種做壞的貨品，如果能够出售，那末可以拿回一部份現金，如果絕對不能出售，那末只在作爲開支，譬如一家餅乾廠裏的碎餅乾，當然不能當好餅乾賣，而祇能當碎餅乾的價錢，這好餅乾與碎餅乾售價之間的差額，就是耗損的數目了。　　G試騐工作：在許多製造廠裏，在正式製造貨品之前要經過試驗工作，是有費用要負担的，因此在開支方面，就要有一筆支出。　　H光·熱·電力：這是製造廠中不可缺少的，也是貨品成本中的重要成分。　　I淸潔工作人員：在規模較大的製造廠裏担任淸潔工作的人員，因爲數目很多，也要成爲一筆相當數目的開支。　　J其他：凡是不能列入原料或工資二項之下的費用。　　開支的分配　　通常一般企業紐織，在實行決算的時候，那末是把所有的開支在貨品售價，除去製造成本，成爲毛利之後除去而成爲凈利的，但這是會計方面的計算方法，要計算成本，那末應該原料工資合起來計算的，因此可以算出，那一種佔居多少，是不是過多而應該减少，現在我們要討論這開支公佈方法：　（待續）</p>

<p>春秋橋畔詩人　揚州續夢之三  洪爲法　　　揚州的瘦四湖，似乎不能和「濃妝淡抹總相宜」的杭州西湖相比，卻也不必相比。在揚州的花局裏陳列着若干盆景，多很小巧可愛，看來這瘦西湖就和那些盆景是一樣的。在那些盆景中，有時會放置着幾塊玲瓏的小石塊，這自然是很雅致的點綴。在戰前的瘦西湖；如其論到雅致而又馓有別趣的點綴，一些竹籬茅舍以及疏疏落落的亭臺，似乎都不夠味，總該要數到那橋畔詩人了。　　這橋是指北郭外的大虹橋。這橋畔詩人的姓名，知道的人就極少。瘦西湖的遊客都稱他是詩人。這位詩人，卻不會寫詩，祇會誦詩。不過在一條蜿蜒的綠水裏，兩岸草木也青翠欲滴，還有各種秀媚的花兒在枝頭或者草間開放着，這遊湖必須經過的大虹橋，便模臥在綠水之上。就這橋畔的綠陰之下，會有一位白髮蒼然的老人，向着往來遊湖的小船，吟誦這詩歌，這不是很雅致而有饒有別趣的點綴嗎？稱他是詩人，似乎也怪有意義的。　　這位詩人手持着一根很長的竹竿，竿頭還綴着一隻小布袋。譬如說，有了遊湖的小船經過他面前時，他一面吟誦着詩歌，一面將竹竿向小船前遞去，小船上的人就會投幾個銅子到那竿頭的小布袋裏去。原來他是以吟誦詩歌，代替了『老爺』『太太』的呼號。許多遊客對於他都象樂於解　。因爲置身在這樣的景色裏，能添上一位老人在吟誦詩歌，怎不使人發生許多詩意，又增加許多遊興嗎。　　遊客們似乎從來沒註意過這些問題：這位詩人究竟識不識字？他所吟的許多詩歌是誰個教給他的？他們祇覺得這位詩人是很能適應環境的。他在春天，就吟誦着『故人西辭黃鶴樓，煙花三月下揚州；孤帆遠影碧空盡，惟見長江天際流。』這一類詩歌。在秋天，就吟誦着『青山隱隱水迢迢，秋盡江南草未凋；二十四橋明月夜，玉人何處教吹簫。』這一類詩歌。並且他很幽默。對於一些遊湖的少年，他會吟誦着『勸君莫惜金縷衣，勸君惜取少年時；花開堪折直須折，莫待無花空折枝！』對於一些遊湖的妓女，他有會吟誦着『娉娉嫋嫋十三饒，豆蔻梢頭三月初；春風十里揚州路，捲上珠簾總不如！』　　除了雨雪載途，每日的大虹橋畔，這位詩人都是曳長了聲調，向遊客們吟誦詩歌。因爲還有節拍，便也可以動聽了。往來的遊客們，祇要身邊有零碎錢，總會給他一些，不願使他失望的。並且給與不給，他並不斤斤計較，還是很和藹的吟誦着詩歌，這倒使人有些過意不去。因此，遊客們的船隻行駛到將要靠近他，聽得他吟誦的聲音時，多會互相查問一下，誰有零碎的錢。如是船上有了小孩子，這小孩子必搶着把錢遞到那小布袋裏去。這時，她會笑容可掬的道聲「謝謝，」逗引得孩子們也格格的笑起來，或者還要他再添一首。這麽，船隻已是悠悠的前進了幾丈遠，還可聽到他的饒音裊裊哩。　　這該是瘦西湖上惟一雅致二有饒有別趣的點綴。可惜在抗戰的火燄還未燃燒起來時，這位詩人便死了。自從這位詩人死了以後，雖是湖山無恙，吟誦詩歌的聲音卻再也聽不到了。舊日的遊人，每當再來湖上，經過那大虹橋畔時，似乎都有說不出的惆悵。蜀中印人記阿默  高甜心　　曾　躬即阿默，今年六七十歲了。本來刻吳苦　，齊老頭子進川，他又要學老齊的單刀法，但不承認是學齊，而曰學周代罪人磚。刻印渾厚有奇氣，能運刀如筆，刻字直如寫字，但寫篆時又感臃腫少力，頗思以吳齊融合，參已意別成一體。愚見吳齊絕難融合，且根本齊在步吳之後塵，學吳而稍變其法，齊個性甚堅強，故作風亦頗爽快大膽。齊不寫篆，吳寫篆，齊不顧六書，吳顧六書，故根本兩回事矣。缶老曾書「吾道干城」四字贈阿默，山人曾以「墨躬先生多壽」之上款題于贈畫。余客蜀都一日請客，天陰雨，諸人皆翩翩麗服，阿默乃粗衣草鞋，別具風格，名士風流也。劉開渠的「農工之家」  葉鼎洛　　欣賞藝術品和讀有意義的書籍，可以說是最愉悅的事情了。曾經我間接在書本上看見許多彫塑家的作品，但這些，不過都是平面的攝影，沒有法子尋見出它的渾圓的趣味。在龍門那些地方，可以看見古代的彫像，但這都是匠人的作品，除了是那麽一個糢樣外，不能看出作者自身的意見。很多地方立着偉人的銅像，那是後人用以紀念他們的功績的，但功績，究竟還是附於彫刻家，沒有彫刻家保存它的狀態，已經腐爛了的屍體，誰能知道他的容貌呢？文人的筆，可以將值得傳的人物和故事垂之永久，但是要寫出其狀態，究竟不如畫，而畫僅是平面的藝術，具體而立體地將那人物表現出來，莫過於彫刻了。但彫刻家除了給人造像外，還有自己的思想的一面，依着自己的意思，做出自己心愛的東西，好像人家的奶媽也會給自己生孩子一樣，這種作品，是純粹的藝術品。　　在劉開渠先生的工作室裏看見他的快要完成的「農工之家」，就是這一類作品。　　那是一件一丈長，三尺高的泥塑糢型，一種屏風似的設計，而在中心供出個半圓形，就在這半圓形和左右兩塊橫方形的範圍裏，用「圓形」和「浮彫」的手法，表現出若干生動的人物：一個農婦含着笑嬭着一個孩子，左右有兩個較大的孩子，跨着一匹豬和一隻羊，旁邊一個男人含笑望着她，這是圓形的一部分。浮彫大部分在左右兩個　屏上，右側是一個紡織女工，一個男石匠，左側是一對農伕，這左右的上面，是打鐵，木工，泥水的工匠，和犁田割稻的農人，最上部是火車飛機，和近代的庭院和住宅。　　且不提在這作品上表現出來的開區的　熟的手法，從如此的設計上，可以尋出作者的匠心和意義。這是象徵着中國，正從農業社會走嚮工業社會，從古代走嚮近代，從人力走到機器，從玄學走到科學，而近代的科學化的世界。所以浮漂在上部的緣故，是說明這上是一種沒有實現的理想，僅是我們民族心裏的一種憧憬而已。至於在中心部分，出力　用圓形的手法，造出了一個家庭般的人像，而在個人的面部做出親愛，愉悅的表情，這是想說明一切的簡曆，應該以「一家人」的互助，互愛的精神爲基礎。　　這是一件可以使人徘徊觀瞻的作品，因爲除了藝術本身的趣味能夠喚起我們的想象，還可以在作品本身外，聯想到中國今日若干的問題，那末，雖然是一件彫刻品，就含意之多，也好像一篇文章了。我很喜歡看這一類彫塑品，可惜我沒有巨資，給開渠以工作的相當的代價，而把這作品加上一個美麗的座子，放在一間寬大的房子裏，或在庭院中，供給許多朋友來訢賞。開渠爲經造各方面的人像，工作得很緊張，而還能忙裏偷閒，製成如此的作品，更可以表示出他刻苦的精神，和忠於藝術的態度，所以我希望他能繼續這種精神，源源不絕，造出許多更美麗彫塑品來。農婦（雕刻）  劉開渠淒涼  徐悲鴻漫談中國畫的透視  史良黻　　宇宙間的高度和廣的二次元的空間，如果想把它收進幾尺長的畫紙上，這是有史以來任何人所辦不到的。不管你是哪種形象的創造，必然離不了「視覺」。這種視覺就是創作的中心，把握了這中心，才能把個性表現出來。相反的說，沒有視覺的繪畫，根本就是無謂的塗抹。因爲一個形體的所以成爲形，是由於各個面的集合；這形體的各個面，出現在我們眼簾裏的全是正面，從來沒有表裏都看得見的（透明體除外）。而且物體距離愈遠，其形也愈小，以至看不見。這是很簡單的事實，無庸做多餘的解說。所以畫家們要反映客觀形體，就必須把握着視覺的要素——空間，形體，色彩，光暗，諧調等等，這張東西才富有藝術價值。惟其如此，「消點」的遠近法就産生了。遠在十五世紀意大利的烏徹羅（Uccello）和數學家馬丙提（Manetti）發明了透視學，對於後世宿畫的帮助，實在是無可言喻。　　繪畫在中國呢，古代的作品，非但草木禽獸的遠近不分，就連人物畫也是充滿着平面的感覺。後來南齊謝赫發明了六法論。這一缺點才慢慢的糾正過來。六法中的「應物象形，經營地置」，就是重視「視覺」的法規，也可以說就是透視學。所不同的只是這八個字比較透視學三個字玄奧一點，沒有「幾何」「投影」所標榜的那麽科學罷了。　　那麽中國畫是不是像有些人所說的「另有一種中國透視」呢？這句話我認爲根本錯誤。在古人的論著裏，山水畫的創作分着「平遠」「高遠」「深遠」三種不同的意境，這種平遠，就是平行的透視；高遠，就是平面的透視；深遠，就是立體的透視。古時畫家由於隱士多，住在高山上的多，因此高遠的作品也就特別多，畫面上呈現着山外有山，樹上有樹，水複山重，尺幅千里。就透視的原理說這並沒有錯，這等於我們坐在飛機上看到地面上的情景差不多，遺憾的是後來有一些「抄襲家」，他自己沒有到過名山大川，卻偏要繪製水複山重的鏡頭，因此以訛傳訛，把中國畫弄的一塌糊塗，釀成大家不講透視的風氣。還有一班可惡的老學究，硬說中國畫另有一種透視，甚而至於說山水畫不能有透視！把國畫畫法驅之於更玄奧的牛角尖，後學者也就格外感到困難了。　　雖然中國畫是偏重於精神的想象的，但是它也不主張抹煞客觀現實。我們現在拿出證據來：元朝饒自然的創繪畫十二忌，謂爲「一忌布置拍密，二忌遠近不分，三忌山無氣脈，四忌水無源流，五忌境無彝險，六忌路無出入，七忌石只一面，八忌樹少四枝，九忌人物傴僂，十忌樓閣偏錯，十一忌滃淡失宜，十二忌點染無法」這就充份的說明了透視的重要。次如道濟的「繪畫六則」他說：「對景不對山，對山不對景，倒景，借景，截斷，陰峻」。再如盛大士的「繪畫六難」，所謂「筆少畫多，境顯意深，隊不入怪，平不類弱，經營慘淡，結構自然」。還有張彥遠就建築物說的：「不可擬生動，不可侔氣韻，但要位置背向」。這些代表作家誰都直接間接的在強調着透視的不可忽視。　　不過我們有一點特別需要知道的，國畫的創作，由於工具與西洋的不同，不容許我們像繪製油畫一樣那麼津津於光暗陰影，能夠慢慢的修改再修改。因爲我們所用的是宣紙，毛筆，水墨，表現的手法是以綫條爲主，下筆以後不可能再修改了。要表現透視，只有在用筆用墨上做工夫，用筆用墨的工夫做到爐火純青的境地，透視也就自然的呈現在裏面。王椒畦說：「用筆有工處，有亂頭粗服處，用側筆者亦間用正，用正鋒者亦間用側。用墨之法，忽乾忽濕，忽濃忽淡，有突然一下處，有漸漸成漬處，有澹蕩虛無處，有沉浸濃郁處，兼此數者，自然能具五色」。就這段言看，我敢大胆的說：認爲中國山水畫不能有透視的，這是因爲他的用筆用墨無法，藉這一句話作爲一種掩飾而已。爲帶爐子上天堂而祈禱  牙麥著·戴望舒譯　　在應該到你那兒去的時候，天主啊，　　請使那一天是歡慶的田野揚塵的日子吧。　　我願意，正如我在這塵世上一般，　　選擇一條路走，如我的意願，　　到那在白晝也佈滿星星的天堂。　　我將走上大路，携帶着我的手杖，　　於是我將對我的朋友驢子們說端詳：　　我是法朗西思·牙麥，現在上天堂，　　因爲好天主的鄉土中，地獄可沒有。　　我將對牠們說：來，青天底溫柔的朋友，　　你們這些突然晃着耳朶去趕走　　馬蠅，鞭策和蜜蜂的可憐親愛的牲口……　　請讓我來到你面前，圍着這些牲口——　　我那麽愛他們，因爲他們慢慢地低下頭，　　並且站住，一邊把他們的小小的腳並齊，　　樣子是那麽地溫柔，會叫你憐惜。　　我將來到，後面跟着他們的耳朶無數雙，　　跟着那些驢兒，在腰邊　着大筐，　　跟着那些驢兒，拉着　解人的車輛，　　或是拉着大車，上面有毛　和白鐵滿裝，　　跟着那些驢兒，背上　這着隆起的水囊，　　跟着那些母驢，踏着小步子，大腹郎當，　　跟着那些驢兒，穿上了小腿套一雙雙，　　因爲他們有青色的流膿水的傷創，　　惹得固執的蒼蠅聚在那裏着了忙。　　天主呀，讓我和這些驢子同來見你，　　叫天神們在和平之中將我們提携，　　顫動着櫻桃，光滑如少女歡笑的膚肌，　　而當我在那個靈魂的寄寓的時候，　　似身臨着你的神明的水流，　　使我像那些對着永恆之愛的清渠　　鑑照着自己卑微而溫柔的寒傖的毛驢。談雨  劍虹　　生長在南國的人們，無論誰對雨總不感陌生的。　　正是清秋時節，灰色的天又抽起雨絲，秋風，秋雨，更漫天秋意，一種肅殺的景象確令人引起愁感的，李清照有幾句詞『梧桐更兼秋雨，到黃昏點點滴滴，這次第，怎一個愁字了得』的確，雨點打着桐葉，清脆地，一聲一聲，深入人的心房。　　雨是耐人尋味的，但是在都市卻難領略到，在春天，春光傾瀉在江南時，「杏花春雨江南」的原野是何種情緒呀！「天如空，橋如虹，一葉飄零煙雨中……」這是如何風趣啊『南朝四百八十奇，盡在煙雨樓臺中』這確是一張美麗的畫片『西塞山前白鷺飛，桃花流水　魚肥，青箬笠，綠　衣，斜風細雨不須歸，』這又是如何使人盪漾？紅樓夢裏大觀園的姐妹們，他們懂得『留得殘荷聽雨聲』　　就是在都市裏也好，在雨夕，邀至友或愛人來促膝談心，靜謐的時刻中，祗有窗門被雨聲抖動，調和的韻律節拍着我們的心的跳動呢呢的談心，或是默默的私語，我們會感得我們的心融合在一起，世界，宇宙，都在濃睡的搖籃裏，而我們卻脫離人間，走進詩的氣氛。一寸山河一寸血　55  葉勁風　　我們略略商議了一下步驟，決定先派二位司機和一位同志，回到停車那裏，把車子整理一下，把破車胎換下，順便告訴吳技師，說我們在這裏搜索敵人，然後把車子開進來停在山腳公路上備用。計劃議定，領隊下了命令，我和領隊，帶着六位同志，向電廠出伐，這時天已昏黑。宛平方面砲火仍舊激烈；幾處光火，仍舊燒着。我們剛到山腳，走近廠屋轉角的地方，前面陡然有了槍聲；子彈從我們頭上身旁嘶嘶飛過去。聽去，知道對方人數相當多。　　我們還擊了。三隻手提着槍，五隻手槍同盒子砲，火力也相當壯旺。幾位同志都是好手，用不着指揮。我們應用交替遞進方式進展，第一批人射擊，另一批人前進，如此遞進。不到十分鐘，已經達到廠門。照理，這裏應該有一番激戰，誰知裏面槍聲卻忽然停止。領隊知道裏面已經失了戰鬥力了，便下令「衝」！誰知那般東西，大約沒有退進廠，早向南頭溜走了。　　廠口有兩三具屍首，廠院口內卻看不見什麼；尸首也沒有，人也沒有。朦朧的夜色下，除了一片廣塲外，只有廠房，豎在前面，像一方一方的黑影。另有幾間燒毀了的，還罩着一團黑煙。上午我同鼎元離開這裏的時候，這一片廠屋裏，擁擠着好多搬來避難的人，現在卻是一片沉肅。我們八個人，一人在院門口左近伏着擔任警戒，五位分頭搜索；我和領隊，上鼎元的家裏去。　　我領頭向鼎元住宅走去，幾棵大大小小的樹木，仍舊未動。快到屋門，突然聽到一聲細微呻吟。我門立刻站住。兩面看了一看，瞥見屋左側一棵大樹腳，似乎是有人踡伏着。因爲不曾預備電筒，無法探照。　　「什麽人？」領隊喝了一聲。　　「我哪……老爺！」聲音顫抖着，非常悽慘。　　我也見過不少陰森殘酷的景象，尤其在東北一代。可是像這樣的悲傷痛楚的哭聲，還是第一遭聽到。當時我的背脊就像是有一股涼氣，從下往上，直襲到後腦根，全身不覺撲簌簌的發了一陣寒，打了一個冷噤。　　「我是這屋裏的老媽子…您…就救命…罷…唉…！」　　誰說不是？我們走過去，看見她伏在地下，下身似乎沒有穿什麽，上身只有一件黑短衫，大腿以下，看不清楚，一塊一塊黑的，不知是灰土，還是血漬。　　「兩個小少爺，還在屋子裏…怕活不了哪…！」　　我沒有問她什麽，回身就往屋子裏跑去，摸着開關，把燈打開了；辛喜電流還未斷掉，（長辛店電燈，由車站發電）。</p>

<p>自由談人治  少夫　　蔣廷黻從行總署長的椅子上走下來，引起了許多閒話，行政當局的升遷調動用人自有權衡，我們不欲論列，不過他走而他在行總的一批高級幹部都紛紛請辭，這種人治的一朝天子一朝臣的封建思想的遺留，衹是證明了我們今日距離法治尚有一段路。　　我們設想一下，從副署長，各廳處長，主任秘書，人事室主任，各秘書以至執行長，這一大串高級職員的離去，行總還能像一個機關嗎？能辦些什麼？我們不敢說這是拆台，但至少相信它會影響到行總工作的進行的。因爲，即使新任署長也帶來了一大批所謂班底，不知須費去若干時日才能熟悉各部門的工作實情，救濟工作爭取時間第一，這浪費的時間，喫虧的是什麼人？又該什麼人負責？　　如果霍賓樹先生也像市財政局長谷春帆先生一樣，單論匹馬帶一隻鋪蓋捲上任，豈非將束手無策乎？　　以個人爲中心的小圈圈主義，以及什麼幹部，班底，如果不剷除，敢斷言中國政治前途將不能有大的進步。偶感雜談爲無名英雄吶喊  聖潔　　我雖然不是一個久經沙場的英雄，確是一個走遍半個中國的戰士。八年來，我一直度著戎馬的生涯。我又曾被千百萬人歌頌，獲得了許多光榮頭銜，然而今非昔比，許多事令人心酸！因此，我已離開了軍營回到學校。　　我想勝利不該沖淡了八年中血的記憶。「復員」不該把大家曾經歌頌的衝鋒者，忘個乾淨！縱然戰爭之提早結束，功在原子彈，但原子彈難道竟抹煞了「丘八」的血肉與頭顱？　　勝利以來，短短的一年中，「丘八」的命運像街上的野狗一樣，既沒有人睬，又被人臭罵。從縮編與整軍以後，大批的軍官失業，生活無以爲繼，因而昔日效命沙場，而今行乞街頭。常州有某少校及上尉的軍官，竟把委任狀與勳章擺在馬路上，向往來的行人討錢。古今中外，事之不平，莫過於此！　　後來救濟的辦法來了，軍官總隊成立，開始敢容福作軍官，但是，登記手續不但麻煩，審核更其嚴格！往往許多軍官爲　「編餘的遣散費，來維持旅館的生活，而辦理登記工作效率太差，因之這些「丘八」等到旅館開支無法應付了，那邊審核尚無下文。因而自殺，因而行動出軌者，便時有所聞。社會人士對這些內情很模糊，他們所看到的只是軍人坐車不肯買票，他們所強調的也只是軍人看電影不肯買票，但是你又想想看：他們何以如是？打了八年仗，只落得光蛋一個，看白戲固然「於法不合」，但我們捫心一想，也不該過分攻擊！　　至於榮譽軍人，他們也同樣的慘！日前在自由談上還登著一封關於榮譽軍人行乞的信。大家看了當不至無動於中。爲了對國家的敵人打仗，而斷了腿，折了膀子，居然也因時過境遷，已沒有人再留心他們一眼。這時代，這社會，難道絲毫理性都不復存在？　　再談軍人待遇，上將廿五萬，還抵不上銀行裏的一個工友，起碼軍官竟只有四五萬塊錢。士兵更可憐，班長也不過是一二萬元，小兵連萬元都不到。他們將如何做人，如何生活，我們實不忍也不必再形容了！　　縱然，高級的軍官和將領是舒適的，但支持抗戰還是無數的小兵。報上見不到他們的名字，勳章名單上見不到他們的名字，他們是直接有功於抗戰的無名英雄。列的犧牲了，活著的，得到的是冷酷與輕視。天下竟有如此不平事，真令人無話可說！　　我並不因爲自己曾經是軍人而爲軍人吶喊，我只是因爲我是一個中國人，心所謂危，不敢緘默；我要政府拿出辦法來！我要社會人士拿出「正視」的眼睛看我們！舞弊退出學校  魚　　暑假中，我在學校讀暑假班，同學中有三十多人是本市某有名的私立大學將畢業學生，在一天晚上，我知道了一個秘密：　　這些外來的同學來讀書，全是由一位政治系姓范的同學接洽的，校方規定，每人每科是三萬元，面這位同學毫不客氣，竟加上一萬，三十多人，每人兩課，輕易的六七十萬元上了腰包。恰巧有一位同學因事後繳，這事便被拆穿。然而，更有奇事在後，我親眼看見同學來校詢問，經手的會計卻不肯立刻回答，反去找那位學生商量。我因不在該校，未聞下文，但可知事件並未擴大，我不得不佩服他這能放能收的手腕。這是一件。　　本學期已經開始了，九月底，寢室裏選室長，一共是六人，正室長報告校方以五票當選。可是我明明知道，六個人之中，有一人棄權，一人出外未參加，而當選的也未選自己，五票從何而來？我向同學宣佈，但大家因爲「感情」好，不願說出，這又是一件。　　這兩件都是小事嗎？我從這上面看出中國前途的黑暗正方與未艾？這位政治系的同學，到了政界會不舞弊嗎？大家因爲「感情」好，不肯追究的這位同學，會不舞弊嗎？我真奇怪，這些同學平時常痛罵貪污及庇護貪污者，但放在眼前的事實卻看不見，看見了而並不介意。我想請問：主持學校的教育家們，這些瑣事是否值得重視呢？　　學校是理想機關，不容如此污濁！我們不禁要喊：舞弊退出學校！電影院老闆　我們向你呼籲  李𢽾　　我們是「早出晚歸」的職業階級，我們是公務人員，寫字間職員，學生……　　白天要工作，一日的疲乏和一週的辛勞，希望得到一點「享受」及「精神上的安慰」；因此我們就「光顧」到你們「寶店」裏來。　　「每天夜場及星期例假，票價爲三千，三千五，四千」，爲什麼要漲價？三千元可以開二天伙食了，「窮措大」怎敢「染指」：而時間要九點一刻，散場至少十點三刻，我們回家時，已無電車，已經很心痛付了一筆不小的數目給你，再沒有錢坐三輪車了。　　所以我們向你呼籲：　　一·票價的比例，增大一點，最好的位子，多賣些錢，富人出一萬塊，不當一回事，窮人一千元，也要算算。這比例平均起來，不會比現在讓你們吃虧，要客滿還是照舊客滿。　　二·時間提早一點！晚場早開早歇，你們「夥計」，也好早早「安息」，而我們也可出有「車」，省一筆三輪車錢，可以多「光顧」一次！　　電影院老闆：你們用算盤打打看！花旗風  量　　美國的倫理和中國，有顯然的不同。即據他們平時間的呼喚習慣，也可以得到深深的認識。　　假使第一次到美國；你得明白他們歡喜怎樣一個稱呼。起先，當然可以利用「先生」「博士」「太太」「小姐」這類的套頭，可以時常見面的，那末不應該再用這種種前衛，即使稱他們的「太太」「愛人」也不妨單稱名氏，否則你是故意與他們隔膜。　　美國人常用名氏的一部份音節稱呼，表示親切的意思。譬如Jonson稱Jon，Rorbert稱Rorb，William稱Rill。　　最怪的；學生可以直呼先生名氏，孩子可以呼父親的綽號，所以羅期福總統給屬員的書信用「DearX」已表示十分鄭重的了。　　他們的性格充滿了活潑自由，和我國有著內容上的差異，然而這僅適於青春時期的美國，你如果把英國·法國，……當做美國，那簡直糟糕！浙東之虎田岫山  彌山　　英雄失足，做了階下囚。　　翻閱本月一日的申報，看見了「大盜田岫山。杭堪受會　」的消息，使我不禁憶起那個曾經在滬效顯赫一時的「田鬍子」來。松江青浦一帶的人士，對「田鬍子」的名字是不會陌生的，而且也留有不壞的印象。在敵人佔領江南的時候，田鬍子帶領了數千弟兄，在松青一帶展開游擊戰。當然，一般游擊隊總不免在地方上「予取予求」，但田鬍子的部隊卻異於其他部隊的「游而不擊」，畢竟打過好些仗，也建立過若干汗馬功勞，也算得「取之於民，用之於民」了，老百姓們對「田鬍子」的威名相當怕，也相當敬重。自從後來調去浙東以後，好久沒有他的消息，而街頭巷尾，還不時提起：「田鬍子現在不知怎樣了」？　　報上的消息帶給他們了答覆：「田鬍子」做了強盜了，而且已經被當局捉住。昔日松青民眾心目中的「抗日英雄」，現在已變成了「惡貫滿盈」的「浙東之虎」！并且浙東有五千人民，頂香跪求當局，請求正法田岫山！　　實在，憑他的抗戰期間建立的功績，勝利後，前途是不怕沒有希望的，卻不去好好的幹，而竟然帶了弟兄去搶劫姦焚。到今日自食其果！零零碎碎  W·W　　许多人有这样一个问：谁在抬高物价？　　许多人有这样一个梦：杀尽小奸人！　　然而时光荏苒，又是一年多了，问还是一个「？」，梦依稀一個「夢」！　　「拾元鈔」與「伍元鈔」相對而泣；半晌，它們說：「余等老矣，無　　也矣」。　　百元千元鈔不像以前那樣了，亦喟然歎曰：「生於憂患，死於——仍舊是憂患！如金只有花旗紗步步高昇……」　　它們全垂頭喪氣，一副薄相，美鈔「風聲」吹來，鈔「落」知多少！　　又是望日前夕，不　　錠銀呼喚來。　　她們要喚起民眾，共敬吾佛，然而佛法無邊，何需區區紙物？紙醉金迷，但見之於人間罷了；向佛行賄，該當何罪？惟其買進有人，賣出才見向　，然而無聊之舉，徒然浪費游資，自害害人，可以休了！國外瑣聞白宮內景  郁強　　白宮不僅是一所官廈而已，它是美國團結的象徵。　　一七九二年，經傑姆士·侯月的草擬，白宮落成了。華盛頓總統卸任太早，第一位在白宮度總統生涯的是美國第二任大總統約翰·阿丹姆。　　現在，打開白宮之門，告訴你其中幾間具有特殊歷史性的房間。　　門羅室　　門羅室是另一個時代的紀念物。當赫柏特·胡佛夫人是第一夫人的時期。她將原先的傢俱都移置到佛吉尼亞州弗拉迪列克斯堡的門羅博物館中去了，而倣製了現在擺列著的優美的一套。在這裏，麥金總統簽訂了全國歡欣的和約，結束了殘酷的美西戰爭。　　在美國總統的日常生活中，門羅室許久以來就作爲隱遁二層樓上煩屑的家務與下層樓的紛忙的國務的清地。今天，它是杜魯門總統的起居室，但是，它是永遠的奉獻給傑姆士·門羅了。　　綠室　　一九一〇年五月十七日美國國會通過法案，設立美術國家委員會，以審查所有對於白宮的更變。這之前，這間非正式的應接室的性格隨時跟著每任主人們的志趣而有更變。　　傑弗遜總統在此進餐，亨用著佳肴和與密友談心。在杰姆士·門羅管制時期，室內牌桌上金塊叮噹，鈔票沙沙。後來，學者風度的約翰·昆西·阿丹姆「進宮」了，綠室變成了一間甯靜的會客室，加上了白的凸花帷幕，一張桃花心木書桌和一方幽美的布魯賽爾地毯。等到克列夫蘭總統上任，綠室又不得安靜，它成了音樂室了。　　藍室　　一般人都認爲藍室是白宮內最美麗的房間。十九世紀八十年代，當美國正在興盛和變化中，那不定的狀況，從藍室的歷史中反映出來。最初，它喚作橢圓表的會客室，隨即很快的變成卵形應接室，圓室和藍色的橢圓形沙龍。今天它是國家的正式會客室。　　藍室有過一段浪漫的歷史：克利夫蘭，唯一在白宮結婚的總統，在這飾滿鮮花的房中，向福蘭茜斯·茀爾山姆宣讀他的結婚誓約。同在此室，民主的傑弗遜總統受不了向賓客鞠躬的禮儀，便打破華盛頓和阿丹姆的傳統，而走上前去不分政治家與平民的與他們握手了。　　東室　　有一個世紀以上的時間，美國總統們在堂皇的東室內舉行他們的最重要的社會聚會。一八〇〇年東室還是一所裝置未就的新屋，約翰·阿丹姆總統夫人曾在此晒過衣服。　　當東室內的大鏡子遮起來，墻壁和燈架覆著黑紗的時候，那是永難忘懷的兩天：傷心的民眾排著嚴肅的行列最後一次注視林肯的痛苦的面容和富蘭克林·羅斯福的勞瘁的面容。本年度美國加利福尼亞小姐。（站在最高的）笑話  沙舟　　有個國人學中國話演說「我有兩國比仿（即譬喻），一個比仿在中國，一個比仿在外國」中國聽衆均總爲「我有兩個屁放，一個屁放在中國，一個屁放在外國」相率掩鼻。　　有一外人在中國住十多年，視中國爲第二故鄉，常對國人說。「你們不要當我外人看，要當我內人看」意即要當他中國人看待。　　某大學入學考試，生理題爲「腎臟之功用」某生百思不得，後答「腎臟之功用大矣哉！其最著者，可用炒腰花之用」，蓋此生平時愛吃炒腰花，而對於真正功用，則茫無所知也。滑稽  罔悟　　「懲戒貪污！」「清查他！」誰都在說。　　是的，誰都在說，貪污者自己也在說，而且是激昂慷慨，一番謬論，日月明察！　　「當心扒手！」「捉扒手！」誰都在喊。　　是的，誰都在喊，扒兒手自己也在喊，面且是氣憤填庸，一片不平，神人共鑒！　　這是：我初次認識了滑稽這東西。新聞人物最近辭職的蔣廷  蕃甫　　　　（編者按：最近告退的蔣廷　，本報前已有介紹，這里從另一角度著筆。再說一下，似重複而非重複也。）　　「行總」署長蔣廷　先生，最近已辭職了。蔣氏以一個專攻歷史的學者出身，轉入政界，已經有十一年。回憶他在民國二十四年，最初離開清華大學歷史系主任的職位，參加政府時，曾公開發表談話；「此次廷　投身政治，惟有竭力作事，而不作官，並本科學精神，處理政務，本人對政治之希望爲；對內，希望一切建設能人民實惠予；對外，希望在保存國家獨立·主權完整的條件下，促進友邦邦交。」　　上面這一番話，足見蔣氏的確擅長於辭令。　　歷史教授　　蔣先生是湖南寶慶人，生於遜清光緒二十一年，幼時在鄉塾讀書，十一歲，入長沙明德小學肄業。據蔣氏本人所述，他在該校攻讀期內，以校長胡子靜先生的演說態度辭鋒，給他的印象，最爲深刻。不久，考入湘潭美國教會人士主辦的益智學校，值辛亥革命事起，學校停辦，蔣氏以年齡幼稚，不能加入革命運動，又不願放棄學業，便決計出洋留學，於民國元年渡美，入中學爲半工半讀生，畢業後入歌海　　的奧比侖學院，而在民國七年卒業。卒業後曾往法國遊歷一年，重返美國，入哥侖比亞大學研究院歷史科，得博士學位。歸國後，迭任南開，清華兩大學歷史教授。　　二十四年起，轉入政界服務，曾任駐蘇大使，巡視湘·贛·桂粵等省。此次辭職前，任「行總」署長。　　艱苦學習　　蔣氏是一位生活嚴肅的學者，身邊並沒有什麼趣聞軼事，可以供作談笑。相反的，他過去在美國留學時期，曾有一則令人感歎的苦學經歷：在奧比侖學院攻讀時，爲了湖南省留學官費中途被裁減，蔣氏衹有和其他有官費的中國留學生同居一宅，由他們有錢的出錢，蔣氏無錢，衹有出力，擔任烹飪洗掃，著實捱過幾年的辛苦。　　蔣先生今已辭職。他主持下的「行總」，時常遭到各界的攻擊，被稱爲「救濟本署」，陷在四面楚歌的處境中，也許爲了環境和交通運輸的關係，「行總」的任務未能盡如人意，但是，我們希望蔣先生不要畏避艱難，有一分能力，幹一分的事，過去，蔣先生不是說過：對內的政治希望是，一切建設能予人民實惠。最低限度，「行總」應該做到這一點。　　歷史是悠久的，蔣先生是一位歷史專家，他一定懂得如何把個人的生命在永恒的歷史中留下一點光輝。我們期待著！</p>

<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 6th] Chief of Staff Chen's visit to Beiping this time has been little known to the outside world. Beiping reporters have been following Chen throughout the day, but all parties are tight-lipped. No one has yet discovered Chen's residence.

<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 6th] Baoding, 6th. Chi Fengcheng stated yesterday: The Pingbao Line can be cleared within five days. Since the Third Army reached Xinle, the vanguard troops reached Ding County yesterday, and the siege of the city can be lifted. The main force of the Communist army in Wangdu is moving south. The National Army and aircraft have established close contact. When the Communist army captured Wangdu and Xushui, they drove civilians to fight and used landmines and tunnel warfare tactics. The Communist army suffered ten times more casualties than the National Army. Yesterday, the outskirts of Baoding were fiercely attacked by the Communist army and fierce fighting is still ongoing.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Beiping, 6th] According to transportation sources, the tracks on the Pingsui Line between Beiping and Nankou were suddenly destroyed by the Communist army on the night of the 5th. The train that departed from Fengtai to Nankou this morning derailed between Qinghe and Shahe. The railway bureau is dispatching workers to repair the line. Passenger trains between Beiping and Nankou were suspended this morning as a result. It is heard that repairs can be completed this afternoon, and normal traffic can resume tomorrow.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Beiping, 6th] According to transportation sources, repairs are being actively carried out on the entire Pingsui Railway. It is learned that the eastern section of the line, between Qinglongqiao and Kangzhuang, has been cleared of landmines and a large amount of materials have been transported there in preparation for repairs within the week.

Traffic between Beiping and Nankou has been suspended all day today. The Nankou Office of the Chahar Provincial Government has moved to Kangzhuang.</p>
<h3>Communist Army in Northern Liaoning Besieges Xi'an; Intense Bombardment Causes Heavy Losses in the City; National Army in Xifeng Retreats to Yehe Station</h3>
<p>[Our Changchun Dispatch, 6th] The military situation in the Northeast seems to be becoming tense. After the Communist army's unfavorable attack in Fulongquan, they recently captured Xifeng in the southeast of Siping and are besieging Xi'an. Their intention seems to be to take Xi'an to put pressure on Siping and threaten transportation to Changchun and Shenyang. However, military observers say that this is nothing more than a pipe dream.</p>
<p>[Our Shenyang Dispatch, 5th] According to military sources, the Communist army in northern Liaoning has launched a large-scale offensive in the past week, targeting Xifeng, Xi'an, and Dongfeng. At 1:00 PM on the 4th, the Communist army, with two brigades, besieged Xifeng County. Our National Army, with a force of less than one battalion, fought with them. As a result, the Communist army invaded the city at 1:00 AM on the 5th, and the National Army retreated to Yehe Station. The Communist army also used the 124th, 79th, and other brigades to attack Xi'an. This has been going on for two weeks, with intense bombardment causing heavy losses in the city.</p>
<p>[Our Changchun Dispatch, 5th] Fulongquan was recaptured by the National Army a few days ago. It is reported that in the process of recapturing the area, foreign nationals were found among the Communist army, serving as soldiers.</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 6th] After the Communist army launched offensives in the areas of Xi'an, Dongfeng, and Xifeng in northern Liaoning, the overall situation in the Northeast suddenly became tense. Relevant parties received a report this afternoon that the Communist army is still attacking fiercely, with a force of approximately 30,000 men, transferred from the Yalu River. A certain military affairs expert said: The purpose of the Communist army's offensive in the Northeast is the same as the Communist army's actions in the northern section of the Pinghan Line, intending to contain the National Army in the Northeast and divert the troops in Rehe, and press towards Zhangjiakou from northern Chahar. However, it is reported that the National Army in Rehe has made considerable preparations. If the Communist army's offensive fails to contain the war situation in Chahar Province, it may cause the overall situation in the Northeast to lose its calm. According to people who have just returned from the Northeast, the preparations of the two armies have reached a considerable stage.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Changchun, 6th] (1) The Communist army in the Meihekou area has increased its forces by two brigades on the 5th. The total number of Communist troops in the surrounding area has reached four brigades. They are actively preparing to launch a large-scale invasion of Meihekou. A part of them has been harassing the area between Hailong and Meihekou, but they have been repelled by the National Army. (2) At dawn on the 5th, the Communist army in Taolaizhao shelled our Songhua River garrison troops and the Songjiang Railway Bridge with more than one hundred shells. At 3:00 PM, the Communist army in Dong Wu Jintun, east of Taolaizhao, also shelled our garrison troops on the south bank of the Songjiang River. (3) The area approximately eight li outside Xi'an has been occupied by the Communist army.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Changchun, 6th] According to the person in charge of the Siping Office of the Northeast Region of the Ministry of Transportation, the engineering team train that set out on the morning of the 5th to repair the Pingmei Railway derailed 66 kilometers east of Siping. The reason was that the rails and spikes at that location were removed by the Communist army on the night of the 4th. Another train was dispatched on the 6th. In addition to repairing the derailed locomotive, repairs are being actively carried out. Furthermore, a railway bridge 133 kilometers east of Siping was destroyed by the Communist army on the night of the 5th and is currently under repair. It is expected that the Pingmei Railway will be fully open to traffic within days.</p>
<h3>Communist Army Completely Destroys All Coal Mines in Datong</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Taiyuan, 6th] Xie Shuying, director of the Datong Coal Mine Rehabilitation Committee, recently told reporters that all coal mines in Datong were completely destroyed by the Communist army. Lighter machines were transported away, and heavier ones were blown up. Coal wells were either destroyed or filled in, and offices and bridges in the mining area were burned to the ground. All 3,000 employees have been safely evacuated to Beiping and Datong City. Efforts will be made to repair the mines as soon as transportation is restored.</p>

<h3>Incident of Communist Army Attacking US Military in Xinhe; US Authorities Complete Investigation; Planned Robbery of US Arms</h3>

<h3>Another Turning Point in Peace Talks</h3>
<p>US Ambassador Proposes New Suggestions</p>
<p>President Chiang Had a Long Talk with Ambassador Stuart Yesterday</p>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 6th] A sudden turning point was seen in the peace talks. US Ambassador Stuart Leighton met with Wang Bingnan, the representative of the Chinese Communist Party, today and put forward new suggestions regarding the resumption of talks. The content of this new suggestion is not being disclosed by the Chinese Communist Party, who only said that it came from Ambassador Stuart and has now been sent to Zhou Enlai in Shanghai. Recently, Chiang Kai-shek and Special Envoy Marshall and Ambassador Stuart have been in frequent contact on one hand, and Ambassador Stuart and Wang Bingnan have been in frequent contact on the other. The new suggestions for peace talks were produced as a result.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 6th] Special Envoys Marshall and Stuart are still making final efforts for the stalled peace talks. Although today is a weekly holiday, Marshall and Stuart visited President Chiang together at 10:40 AM, relaying Wang Bingnan's proposal to Ambassador Stuart yesterday regarding a ceasefire in Zhangjiakou and seeking his opinion.

Tonight, according to a spokesman for the Communist Party representative, the mediators are still making final efforts, and the Communist Party also does not want the situation to move towards a breakdown. However, what the Communist Party still feels regretful about is that if the memorandum issued by the government included a sentence about Zhangjiakou, before the government formally responded to the Communist Party's request that the government immediately call for a ceasefire in the Zhangjiakou area, it could clarify the government's true intentions. As for Zhou Enlai in Shanghai, he is currently stepping up the drafting of regulations, and it is possible that Zhou will personally take these regulations back to Nanjing. Dong Biwu also visited Liang Shuming, the Secretary-General of the Democratic League, at 10:00 AM to exchange views on the general situation.</p>

<h3>China's Transportation Launches a Pioneering Initiative: Machinery and Construction of the Fuzhou-Xiamen Road; Director of the Fujian Construction Department Comes North to Negotiate and Leaves Shanghai to Return South</h3>
<p>[Our City News] Zhu Daijie, Director of the Construction Department of the Fujian Provincial Government, sought instructions from the Central Government and consulted with the UNRRA headquarters regarding the reconstruction of the Fuzhou-Xiamen highway and other construction matters in the province. After a month of efforts in Nanjing and Shanghai, progress has been made. The UNRRA authorities sent engineer Jia Ruixin to the province in June of this year to survey the Fuzhou-Xiamen highway. He conducted a precise inspection and measurement of the entire highway, believing that the road is related to the prosperity of the central and southern provinces,</p>
<p>and it is worthwhile to expedite the construction of a perfect highway. The UNRRA authorities in China have agreed to supply 230 units of road construction machinery, mountain opening machinery, stone crushing machinery, and transportation vehicles, as well as the necessary fuel (including engine oil, gasoline, etc.). The CNRA has agreed to allocate a huge amount of flour to be used as wages for road construction workers. As for other miscellaneous equipment and management costs, estimated at about 3 billion yuan, Mr. Zhu has prepared a plan and submitted it to the Ministry of Transportation for approval. Minister of Transportation Yu Dawei also attaches great importance to the construction of this road and has summoned Mr. Zhu twice to inquire and discuss. He expressed gratitude for UNRRA's agreement to allocate various road construction machines. Because China's highways are all built by manpower, many are simple and do not meet modern highway standards. The Fuzhou-Xiamen highway will be the first highway in China built with machinery, which is a unique highlight in the history of China's transportation. Minister Yu has agreed to subsidize half of the road's budget, 1.5 billion yuan, and has also agreed to allocate an additional several hundred million yuan for the required cement. The remaining funds will be raised by the Fujian Provincial authorities. The National Highway Administration is also very willing to assist in the success of this road and has instructed Cai Shichen, the head of the Third Mechanical Highway Corps of the bureau, to cooperate with Mr. Zhu along with the technical personnel of the entire corps. It is reported that Mr. Zhu is scheduled to leave Shanghai tomorrow to return to Fujian to organize the Fuzhou-Xiamen Highway Construction Committee.</p>

<h3>What I Saw in Xuzhou</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent Hang Zhou, Xuzhou, September 25th, from Our Newspaper</p>
<p>After the center of the war in Northern Jiangsu shifted north, I arrived in Xuzhou. Xuzhou is located at the intersection of the Jinpu and Longhai Railways. It is a historically famous military stronghold. It had a heroic Battle of Xuzhou during the Anti-Japanese War and is now the location of the Pacification Headquarters. General Xue Boling commands an army of 500,000 here to cope with the communist army's offensive and inflict necessary blows.</p>
<p>The Jinpu Railway is much more deserted than the Beijing-Shanghai Railway. On the special express train that departed at 8:40 p.m. on September 22, there were very few first-class passengers. In the second-class carriage, one person occupied a long bench and lay comfortably for ten hours. When I opened my eyes at dawn, it was the destination.</p>
<p>Wind, Sand, Grapes, Pears, Pomegranates</p>
<p>In Xuzhou, you can see the northern atmosphere. The wind and sand kiss the earth. In autumn, the ripe grapes tempt people's appetites. After the opening of the Xuzhou-Bian section of the Longhai Railway, Dangshan pears were transported in large quantities, costing 500 yuan each and tasting fresh and sweet. Added to this are the pomegranates from Xiao County. These delicacies on the Shanghai people's menu can be enjoyed universally here.</p>
<p>The north is simple. It is rare to see women in fancy dresses on the streets of Xuzhou. Housewives all wear blue cloth cheongsams, don't perm their hair, and wear cloth shoes. The roads are quite wide, and although there is wind and sand, there is very little garbage. The houses are quite neat. The office of the Pacification Headquarters is now in an ancient style, but it is magnificent inside and has various modern facilities.</p>
<p>Everything in Xuzhou can be said to express "Military First". Local administrative personnel put aside other work and devote all their energy to three things: repairing roads, compiling baojia; purging the countryside; in addition, there is also conscription. The Pacification Headquarters governs the entire area of Jiangsu, Shandong, and Anhui provinces and a part of Henan. This year, it will conscript more than 80,000 soldiers, which has been largely completed. "What difficulties did you encounter in conscription?" The answer from Feng Zigui, the administrative commissioner of the ninth district of Jiangsu Province, was beyond my expectations. He said: "The difficulties are actually less than during the Anti-Japanese War, especially in the recently recovered areas. The people's property has been fought over, and after gritting their teeth, they are quite willing to become soldiers."</p>
<p>Teng Jie, the director of the political department of the Pacification Headquarters, told me another thing: "There are no bandits in Xuzhou anymore, thieves are being purged, and refugees have been separately accommodated and relieved, so there are no beggars either." Beggars, it seems, are rarely encountered. An old man with white hair followed me for a while, saying, "Sir, I am going back to my hometown tomorrow. I need some travel money!"</p>
<p>The business community is very depressed, with the exception of the money industry, hotels, restaurants, and bathhouses.</p>
<p>This is an abnormal phenomenon, mostly caused by military and political personnel coming and going and those waiting to return home. These people live in hotels and have no place to spend their money, so they buy gold rings, gold bracelets, gold bars...</p>
<p>General Talks Candidly</p>
<p>General Xue Boling is the key figure here. On the night I arrived in Xuzhou, Mr. Xue hosted a group of reporters and expressed his views on the current situation. He first talked about the Battle of Huaiyin. Like the Battle of Siping Street in the Northeast, it defeated the main force of the communist army in Northern Jiangsu. The situation has completely changed. There should be no major battles in the future, and there is a chance to clarify the situation.</p>
<p>Huaiyin is the old nest of the communist army in Northern Jiangsu, and Heze, Jining, and Linyi are the main bases of the communist army in Southern Shandong. Except for Linyi, Heze and Jining have also been recovered by the army. Therefore, the communist army in Southern Shandong is shaking. He showed a very optimistic meaning when he said this.</p>
<p>"The communist army likes to fight but cannot fight." He continued: "They have never formally fought against the Japanese army in the eight years of the Anti-Japanese War, and the strategies and tactics they use are outdated." He gave an analogy, "The communist army is like a mouse, like a mosquito, that's all."</p>
<p>"All revolutionary parties take the welfare of the people as a prerequisite, while the Communist Party takes the bankruptcy of the welfare of the people as a prerequisite. Such a party cannot be regarded as a revolutionary party, and it does not even have the qualifications of an ordinary political party."</p>
<p>"For the sake of the people, the government must save them from fire and water! When the national army recovers a place, the people there welcome the national army with a degree of fanaticism. This can be testified to the world: which side does the Chinese people's hearts lean towards!"</p>
<p>Mr. Xue vigorously promoted Sun Yat-sen in politics, believing that no political theory from ancient and modern times at home and abroad can surpass the Three Principles of the People; in military affairs, he vigorously promoted Sun Tzu. Mr. Xue has a unique study of "Sun Tzu's Art of War". The reception was conducted seriously for two hours. Mr. Xue's senior staff all attended the reception but did not express their opinions.</p>
<p>Xuzhou Executive Group</p>
<p>What exists disharmoniously in this city is the communist party representative of the Xuzhou Executive Group of the Military Mediation Department and the Transportation Group. A total of twelve people live in a semi-new small western-style house behind the Farmers Bank. The leader, named Wang Shaoyong, previously served in the Shandong communist army. He was a colonel and wore a set of homespun military uniforms. When I went to visit them, they expressed their depression to me. But when I went to visit the government representative, Lieutenant Colonel Liu Yongfang told me everything he had seen and suffered in the communist area. The distance between what the two sides said was so far!</p>
<p>One of the communist party representatives, Mr. Sun Gongfei, once served in the national army. At the beginning of the Anti-Japanese War, during the Battle of Shanghai, he fell behind and encountered the communist party's troops, so he joined the communist army. This was a very accidental opportunity. In the end, he stated that he was an old roughneck and could not speak well.</p>
<p>Colonel Wang Shaoyong is a very eloquent person. He said that he has always been in the countryside and is not used to coming to the city, but his words show that he is a shrewd person. He used "very clear" and "haven't heard" to answer certain questions.</p>
<p>In any case, people's smiles and hatred are unfolding with the military evolution, and the displaced refugees can return to their hometowns.</p>
<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Consoling Overseas Chinese in the Dutch East Indies</h3>
<p>Mr. Li Dijun, the envoy for consoling overseas Chinese in the Dutch East Indies, will take a special plane from Beijing to Hong Kong today to fly to the Dutch East Indies to console overseas Chinese. Before his departure, Mr. Li told reporters that the task of this trip is to represent the government in expressing commendation to overseas Chinese in the Dutch East Indies for their service to the country, and to represent President Chiang in consoling overseas Chinese who have suffered during and after the Japanese surrender. He also intends to investigate the various damages suffered by local overseas Chinese before, during, and recently. More than two million overseas Chinese from our country reside in the Dutch East Indies, and over the years they have cared for and supported the motherland in many ways. This time, after enduring the ravages of war, the damage suffered by overseas Chinese has been extremely severe. In addition, the Indonesian government has deliberately excluded overseas Chinese after the war, and has recently promulgated harsh regulations prohibiting the retention of cash and prohibiting Chinese letters. There are many such regulations, and countless innocent people have been brutally massacred in recent months. At this juncture, our government has specially sent an envoy to express condolences, which is enough to show our government's concern for overseas Chinese. As Envoy Li heads south, we offer a few words to send him off and also to tell our overseas Chinese in the Dutch East Indies.</p>
<p>China and the Dutch East Indies have been in contact for a long time. The countries of Srivijaya and Java have paid tribute several times, as recorded in history books. From the Ming and Qing dynasties to modern times, Chinese people have gone to the Dutch East Indies in an endless stream. Even today, our overseas Chinese in the Dutch East Indies are still a major part of the national life of the Dutch East Indies. Since the Dutch East Indies fell under Dutch rule, the homeland of the Indonesian people has long ceased to exist; fortunately, the Dutch government has worked hard to govern, and the development of the Dutch East Indies' resources and political facilities cannot be considered slightly better among the generally ruled people, but after this war, even Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands' enlightened declaration cannot suppress the rise of national sentiment. The so-called Indonesian Republic movement has emerged. Until today, the situation in the Dutch East Indies is still chaotic. Our overseas Chinese have already suffered greatly during the war in the Dutch East Indies and during the subsequent Japanese occupation period. In addition to sympathy, we express our deep condolences.</p>
<p>We do not want to comment on the political situation in the Dutch East Indies here. As Envoy Li said, the situation in the Dutch East Indies is quite chaotic. There are three governments controlling the Dutch East Indies: one is the Allied government, mainly led by British troops, one is the Dutch East Indies government led by the Netherlands, and the other is the Indonesian government organized by Indonesians. Under these three regimes, it is imaginable that our overseas Chinese residing in the Dutch East Indies have suffered all kinds of damages. In Java, Sumatra, and other places, anti-Chinese acts have been seen frequently in recent times, leading to bloody tragedies. Regarding this tragic case, we hope that Envoy Li will investigate in detail, demand that the Dutch East Indies authorities severely punish the perpetrators, give the relatives of the dead and injured the compensation they deserve, and ensure that the same thing does not happen again. In order to ensure the rights and interests of our overseas Chinese in the Dutch East Indies, and at the same time for the future of the entire Dutch East Indies, we sincerely hope that the situation in the Dutch East Indies can be clarified as soon as possible. As for all kinds of discriminatory laws against our overseas Chinese in the Dutch East Indies, we should argue on the basis of reason and demand their abolition, which goes without saying.</p>
<h3>U.S. President's Statement Aiding Jews</h3>
<p>At a time when the issue of Jews and Arabs in Palestine is inextricably intertwined, President Truman suddenly issued a statement advocating for the immediate large-scale relocation of Jewish refugees to Palestine. He also supported the establishment of a Jewish state in appropriate areas of Palestine and opposed the plan to divide Palestine between Jews and Arabs.</p>
<p>This statement is very abrupt and, in fact, seems impossible to implement. It is abrupt because Truman did not consult with the United Kingdom beforehand. British Prime Minister Attlee, upon receiving notification, immediately requested a delay in its release, but this was not accepted. In reality, it is unworkable because the United Kingdom advocates for the division of Palestine between Jews and Arabs under joint rule and is determined not to relinquish its own ruling power to allow the establishment of an independent Jewish state. As for the immigration issue, the UK is using all its power to prohibit it, unwilling to offend the Arabs and create a stalemate. The British government is unlikely to accept President Truman's approach in the short term.</p>
<p>It's not just the British government that opposes it; the Arabs will oppose it even more. Arabs have lived in Palestine for hundreds of years and have long considered Palestine their own land. Moreover, Jews are superior to them in terms of knowledge and wealth, and Arabs have no chance of competing with Jews. Racial animosity and economic rivalry are the fundamental problems between the Jewish and Arab communities in Palestine. President Truman has not come up with any solutions to address these fundamental problems. Suddenly announcing his willingness to assist Jewish immigration and establish a Jewish state is, in fact, unfeasible.</p>
<p>Of course, if President Truman is truly determined to implement his statement, he must send a large U.S. military force, estimated by experts to require fifty thousand troops, to escort the Jews into Palestine and station them there for a long time, helping the Jews resist the aggression of the Arabs and the Muslim League. Such a move is not only something President Truman is unwilling to do, but even if he were willing, the U.S. Congress, government officials, and the majority of the people would oppose it. As a result, it would still be impossible to implement in reality.</p>
<p>These are all very common facts, and it would be ridiculous to say that President Truman didn't see them. But why would he suddenly issue this impossible statement? Based on our speculation, President Truman's move is mainly aimed at gaining the sympathy of Jewish constituents at home, rather than sincerely resolving the dispute over the Palestine issue. Since the purpose is domestic politics rather than diplomacy, whether it can be implemented diplomatically is irrelevant. What President Truman needs at the moment is to make a gesture of sympathy towards the Jewish community at home in order to win their support. The statement is just a gesture. If it encounters obstacles after the statement and cannot be implemented, the responsibility will naturally fall on the UK and the Arabs. President Truman will be successful regardless.</p>
<p>Regarding President Truman's political style, we have another strong piece of corroborating evidence. According to recent reports from American journalists, the truth about Wallace's speech has become clear. President Truman has always disagreed with Wallace's foreign policy. Since Wallace delivered a speech regarding the Iceland negotiations in March of this year, President Truman has forbidden him from discussing foreign policy again. However, in early September, because of the New York mayoral election, President Truman felt it necessary to win over left-leaning elements, so he not only specifically approved Wallace's speech but also stated to reporters that he approved Wallace's "entire speech." Later, it caused a great uproar at home and abroad, which he had not anticipated because he was then completely focused on domestic party strife.</p>
<p>The political influence of Jews in the United States cannot be underestimated. Although their numbers are not large, Jews have the ability to control government positions, news organizations, congressional seats, and especially important businesses. Jews around the world, no matter in which country, tend to go to two extremes: one is to become major capitalists or academic leaders in society by virtue of their intelligence and opportune moments, and the other is to become proletarians with no opportunities and gain a leading position among workers. Therefore, Jews have political influence on both the left and the right. If the ruling party in the United States hopes to win again in the next election, it seems that it must make great efforts, and everyone admits that President Truman's appeal is far inferior to that of Roosevelt. Although many postwar diplomatic and political measures are partly due to adverse circumstances, they have given the opposition party an opportunity to severely criticize. President Truman seems to be aware of this crisis and is therefore trying his best to win over the masses at home. This explanation, even if not entirely correct, is at least largely close to the truth. Because, according to a United Press dispatch from Washington on the 4th, "The reason for this is that someone in New York has published advertisements attacking the government and the Democratic Party for failing to handle this matter properly." There is no doubt that the advertisements in New York were published by American Jews.</p>
<p>The domestic politics of a country often affect its foreign policy. In modern European history, the rulers of a country have sought to consolidate their own positions by exaggerating the threat of future wars to their own people. Twenty-five years ago, the British philosopher Russell had already bitterly criticized this in his book "Roads to Freedom." Today, the authorities in many countries around the world continue to exaggerate the threat of future wars to their own people, and the reason for this is no different. This may be very clever from the perspective of maintaining their power, but setting off a cannon does not necessarily take into account the consequences, and it is ultimately not a sustainable solution.</p>
<h3>Thoughts on the Partial Reorganization of the British Cabinet</h3>
<p>The long-rumored partial reorganization of the British cabinet was finally announced the day before yesterday. Although the changes in cabinet members are limited to the ministers of the Navy, Army, and Air Force, this reorganization is of great significance.</p>
<p>First, the addition of a Ministry of Defence to the British Cabinet, unifying the UK's military structure, with Naval Minister Alexander taking office as Minister, is a major innovation for British defense. This move by the UK has been rumored for a long time. Chief of the General Staff of the Army, Field Marshal Montgomery, visited Washington earlier this month to study the American military organization, indicating that the UK would cooperate with the US militarily in the future. Therefore, in the eyes of nervous people, the establishment of the Ministry of Defence is tantamount to preparing for a "future war." In fact, based on the experience and lessons learned from World War II, unified command of the Navy, Army, and Air Force is an indispensable factor in strategy. Therefore, the unification of military institutions today is a common trend in countries around the world. Therefore, when the British government declared that this reform was the result of forty years of natural development in the British military organization, it was undoubtedly a sincere statement.</p>
<p>Second, the British cabinet reshuffle has brought in several promising young and talented individuals, injecting a lot of new blood into the British government, to avoid it being too old and difficult to promote. The sudden promotion of McNiel to Minister of State shows that the Labour government has a style of attracting young people into the cabinet. Regardless of its political achievements or external criticism, the current Attlee cabinet is still the most dynamic cabinet in the world.</p>
<p>Third, after Germany surrendered in May last year, the United Kingdom held a general election, and the Labour Party won an unprecedented victory and formed a new cabinet. At that time, the country was riddled with holes, and reconstruction was not easy. Although there were some new achievements in domestic affairs, its foreign policy still could not completely break away from the style of the Conservative Party. On the other hand, the Conservative Party was very dissatisfied. The current situation of the Labour cabinet feels as if it is on a narrow path, getting narrower and narrower.</p>
<p>Fourth, after this reorganization of the British cabinet, although some young people have been promoted, most of the veteran Labour members remain in the cabinet, and there will be no changes in general policy guidelines. The focus of the Labour Party's program remains on nationalization policies to improve the economic life of the people. No matter how the Conservative Party opposes it, the Labour cabinet will never change its position or line.</p>
<p>Fifth, the Labour Party's policy guidelines are, in principle, mostly endorsed by the people, but in practice, it often lacks the spirit of moving forward courageously and is inevitably indecisive. However, when we study the reasons for this, it is indeed due to the current environment. After the war, the material difficulties in Britain are left aside. In terms of its diplomacy, Foreign Secretary Bevin has put in a great deal of effort in how to find a way out of the current difficult situation. We believe that the British are the most shrewd and calculating, especially in the intricate international situation. British foreign policy often shifts imperceptibly, while consistently maintaining its consistent policy of maintaining the balance of power in the world. Whether it's old or young, conservative or progressive, the British are still the British, and the British government is still the British government. Despite the fact that the center of gravity of the postwar world seems to be between the United States and the Soviet Union on the surface, the British government's actions still have a significant impact. This point, in particular, must be deeply understood by the Chinese.</p>

<h3>Wang Maogong Arrives with Instructions, Severely Suppressing Grain Prices in Suzhou and Wuxi, The New White Limit is 54,000 Yuan, Absolutely Cannot Exceed, Grain Merchants Request for Increased Freight Profits Rejected</h3>
<p>[Report from Suzhou, October 6th, by our newspaper] Suzhou Provincial Chairman Wang Maogong, under the order of Premier Song, to suppress grain prices in Suzhou, specially arrived in Suzhou from Wuxi at 4 pm on the 6th, leading his secretary Zhou and retinue, staying at the Garden Hotel. After a brief rest, at 9 am he ordered County Magistrate Lu to convene the leaders of the local gentry, business associations, and grain associations at the hotel for an emergency meeting. Mr. Wang announced two principles regarding the grain price issue: (1) First, to maintain a balance between Suzhou and Wuxi prices, (2) to ensure that Suzhou rice prices are lower than Wuxi, with the new top-grade white rice temporarily set at a maximum of 54,000 yuan, not to be exceeded. Mr. Wang ordered the grain associations to hold their own discussions first, with the lower, the better. At 4 pm, Mr. Wang visited the county government, convening the chief commissioners of the two districts, the county government, the police bureau, and the heads of departments and offices at the county level for instructions, individually inquiring about the work of each unit in detail. In addition to encouraging the spirit of creativity in politics, Mr. Wang also gave instructions on six points for the future: (1) Establish security, complete the compilation of baojia and land registration to consolidate the foundation of governance; (2) Implement the new county system, improve the autonomous organizations at all levels, to prepare for remote governance of the people; (3) Pay attention to transportation construction; (4) Complete the collection of land tax in kind, ensuring it is collected by December 15th; (5) Suppress grain prices, it must be done to maintain 54,000 yuan as the highest limit; (6) Promote the conscription system, and the quota of 980 must be recruited in full. The instructions ended at approximately 6 pm. Because past efforts to suppress grain prices have had extremely minimal effects, the reporter stationed in Suzhou made a special trip to visit Mr. Wang again to make inquiries. He was told that this time, the decision to set the maximum price for new top-grade white rice at 54,000 yuan has been personally discussed with County Magistrate Lu, who must insist on it. Currently, the grain associations have reported that after discussions, they plan to add 3,000 yuan for transportation costs and 2,500 yuan for profits, which Mr. Wang has decided to reject. If rice merchants comply outwardly but secretly transport rice, they will be dealt with decisively, and so on. Mr. Wang is scheduled to return to Zhenjiang at 12:30 am on the 6th.</p>

<h3>Suppression of Bandits in Southern Jiangxi Mostly Completed</h3>
<p>(Report from Nanchang by our newspaper) Last year, the Communist Party in northern Guangdong instigated chaos, and there were also stray soldiers and scattered bandits in southern Jiangxi. Dayu, on the border between Jiangxi and Guangdong, became their center for gathering followers. Initially, they committed burglary and robbery, and intercepted merchants. Later, they actually set up checkpoints to collect taxes, spreading to the borders of Hunan, Guangdong, and Fujian. Subsequently, the provincial government sent Song Xiangcheng, deputy commander of the Security Office, to lead security teams to garrison southern Jiangxi and coordinate with Hunan and Guangdong provinces. In Dayu, Xinfeng, San'nan, Yongyu, and other places, many bandits were killed. The remaining forces were broken up into smaller groups and fled into the deep mountains. The bandits in Dayu have been mostly cleared. As for the bandit groups in eastern Jiangxi, such as Guangfeng and Dexing, they have been suppressed by security teams several times, but they flee here and there. Currently, Jiangxi, Zhejiang, and Fujian provinces are jointly carrying out a final campaign.</p>

<p>Soliciting Fair Methods for Levying Income Tax</p>
<p>Income tax is the obligation of the people, and the government's method of collecting it should also have a reasonable standard. It should not be self-contradictory or vastly different, so that it can demonstrate trustworthiness. A comparison of the old and new regulations for salary income tax is studied as follows:</p>
<p>Previous Practice: Income below 100 yuan was exempt from tax, and income of 100 yuan was taxed at one jiao, which is one-thousandth.</p>
<p>New Practice: Tax is levied starting from an income of 51,000 yuan. However, this amount is based on the fact that businesses and industries pay salaries according to the city's cost-of-living index for August, with a basic salary of only 11 yuan. For a basic salary of 100 yuan, the salary paid according to the cost-of-living index is over 450,000 yuan. According to the new rate, the income tax payable is about 20,000 yuan, estimated at a little over 65 per thousand, which is 65 times higher than the previous practice of taxing 100 yuan at one-thousandth. Even if the income of civil servants in the city is calculated at 200,000 yuan based on a basic salary of 100 yuan, the income tax payable according to the new rate is 4,790 yuan, also estimated at 24 per thousand, which is 24 times greater than the previous practice.</p>
<p>Previous Practice: When the income was taxed at 190 yuan, 1 yuan and 9 jiao was 1%.</p>
<p>New Practice: According to the practice of businesses and industries issuing salaries based on the August cost-of-living index and giving discounts to high salary grades, someone with a basic salary of 190 yuan would have an income of over 700,000 yuan. According to the new rate, the income tax payable is about 55,000 yuan, accounting for 8%.</p>
<p>Previous Practice: To be taxed at 8% of income, the income must exceed 1,000 yuan.</p>
<p>New Practice: According to the above calculation, for those with incomes exceeding a basic salary of 190 yuan, the tax levied is 8% or more, even approaching 10%.</p>
<p>From the above brief comparison, it can be seen that the income tax levied on the salaried class is much higher than the old practice, which is harmful to vitality. This is because the majority of the salaried class are middle and lower-level cadres in society, not profiteers or high-ranking officials. They have no share in war profits, victory profits, or acquisition profits. For the past eight years, the income of the salaried class has been insufficient to provide adequate food and clothing. They have been struggling to make ends meet, with a hundred holes and thousands of sores. They have not yet recovered. Now, the general income is nominally 200,000 yuan, but its purchasing power is actually only 40 yuan. Suddenly, they have to pay this income tax, which is vastly different from the past, and also cope with the new taxes added in the city, as well as the heavy cost of children's education (please do not forget that in other countries, the government bears this burden). The income of the salaried class, who are struggling to make a living, is greatly reduced, making it difficult for them to survive. It is also said that starting from April of this year, the arrears will be recovered according to the new rate, which will be even more unbearable. The fairest and most reasonable method is to calculate according to the old tax rate based on the basic salary, and then multiply it by the percentage of the income. For example, for someone with a basic salary of 100 yuan, tax should be levied at one jiao according to the old practice. If their income is multiplied by the cost-of-living index, then the one jiao should also be multiplied accordingly. If civil servants have a different multiple, it should also be multiplied accordingly. Would that not be the fairest? I would like to speak out for the salaried class. (Fan Zhengbang)</p>
<p>Soliciting Opinions on the Designation of Regional Names</p>
<p>After the victory of the War of Resistance and the recovery of the concessions, the Westernized street names in the former two concessions have been completely changed to Chinese names. However, given the vast area of Shanghai, although the former street names were lengthy and complicated, long-term residents of Shanghai were able to remember and identify them without much thought due to historical and customary reasons. Now that all the names have been changed at once, it is really difficult to say all the street names, large and small, in Shanghai one by one. Therefore, the general public still calls them by their old names, and both the new and old names are used randomly in writing letters, just like the solar and lunar calendars. In particular, when selling tickets on trams, the conductors also announce the stops by their old names. I personally saw a passenger ask a conductor what the new name of a street was, and the conductor replied, "I don't know the new street names."</p>
<p>I believe that in such a large city, there seems to be a lack of a regional name designation between the "city" and the "street." Although "Hongkou," "Zhabei," "Nanshi," and "Great World" can be considered regional names, some are historical old names, and some are named after events or objects. The municipal authorities have never clearly stipulated, for example, where "Hongkou" ends to the east and where it ends to the south, north, and west. There are also no detailed boundaries. It is also not stipulated whether the divisions of autonomous organizations and the jurisdiction of police sub-bureaus are considered formal regional names. Furthermore, the boundaries of each district have not been clearly and detailedly demarcated and announced. It is really not easy for citizens to recognize and identify a large pile of street names in such a large city area. Therefore, the abolished names such as "British Concession" and "French Concession" are still used in daily life.</p>
<p>Apart from the difficulty of remembering street names, the lack of regional designations and names seems to be a shortcoming in the entire municipal organization and facilities. I suggest that the municipal authorities should implement the following immediately: (1) Officially demarcate the regional boundaries of the city area, stipulate the names, and announce them. (2) Notify agencies, organizations, schools, stores, post offices, and individuals to include the regional name when writing addresses on letters. (3) Arrange with cartographic publishers to print Shanghai city maps with different colors for each district. In this way, the memory and identification of street names can be narrowed down, and familiarity will be established over time, and municipal facilities will also be improved. What do you think of my humble opinion? (Ping Ming)</p>
<p>Questions Regarding Penalties for Paying House Tax Late</p>
<p>Editor: I am a resident of Zhaofeng Villa. At noon on September 18th, I received a house tax notice, which required payment by September 18th. Thirty-odd thousand yuan is not a small amount, and I had to plan how to raise it. When I paid it on the 20th at the designated location on Kainar Road, I was penalized one-tenth of the amount for late payment. When I argued with them, they said, "We only know how to collect money according to the bill. If you want to appeal, go inside." I didn't understand where "inside" was and didn't dare to venture there, so I had to accept the penalty and return. The more I thought about it, the more I felt that the person in charge must have sent out the notice long ago, and the person delivering it must have been delayed. I hope that the authorities will pay attention to this when collecting taxes next time and prevent similar incidents from happening, otherwise, the people will suspect that the authorities are intentionally trying to make extra money!

<h3>The Resumption of Telecommunications in Various Counties of Jiangsu: 677 Kilometers Now in Operation</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Zhenjiang News] Before the War of Resistance, Jiangsu Province had provincial long-distance telephones covering more than 50 counties, totaling more than 3,000 kilometers in length, and the length of telephones in various county townships was about 57,000 kilometers, which was extremely convenient. During the War of Resistance, all were destroyed. After the victory, in order to unify telecommunications, the Central Government planned to construct them through the Directorate General of Telecommunications, but due to difficulties in labor, materials, and financial resources, it repeatedly instructed the provinces and counties to provide assistance. After the recovery of the Jiangsu Provincial Government, in order to stabilize the situation and according to its needs, it ordered the commissioners and county heads under its jurisdiction to requisition labor and materials to cooperate in the construction, and a total of more than 3,800 wooden and bamboo telephone poles were requisitioned. It is now learned that the provincial government is actively developing the work of pacifying Jiangbei, and the need for telecommunications is particularly urgent. In order to ensure that the counties strive to cooperate, it has designated this as the top priority. For example, in Nantong alone, more than 1,800 telephone poles have been collected within 20 days, and a telephone engineering emergency repair team has been organized to assist the communications troops in carrying out the construction. As of now, a total of 85 locations in various counties have been connected, totaling 677 kilometers in length.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper Tongshan, 5th] Li Yimang, Chairman of the Communist Party's Suwan Border Region Government, is a news figure. His residence in Huaiyin is located at No. 4 Anpu Lane, beautifully furnished, with calligraphy and paintings all over the walls, and a collection of antiques. A reporter visited the site today and saw two tables that he had not taken away. One was made of rattan from Uma Xisaiteng, inlaid with marble, and the other was for summer use, with the entire surface made of glass except for the wooden frame, all extremely valuable. A resident surnamed Jing, who lived next door to Li, was familiar with Li's daily life. Li had two children, and his wife worked in the Municipal Party Committee. The menu for each meal was very rich, and the relationship between the couple was harmonious, with no quarrels heard. Li spent his free time enjoying poetry and books. He once wrote a poem about Jiuhua Mountain, praising Li Zicheng of the late Ming Dynasty. Before the retreat of the Communist army, Li convened a meeting of the people and said that he was determined to live or die together with Huaiyin, but not long after, Li quietly left. Li is from Chongqing, in his forties. Currently, his government is located in a village in Lingxiang.</p>

<h3>The Soviet Union Raises Old Issues; The Issue of Foreign Troops Stationed in the Territory of Non-Enemy Countries; Requests Inclusion in the Agenda of the United Nations General Assembly</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse Success Lake, 5th] The issue of a member state of the United Nations organization stationing troops in the territory of a non-enemy country has been requested by the Soviet delegation to the United Nations General Assembly for inclusion in the agenda of the next General Assembly. The Soviet application is contained in a letter to Lai Yi, which reads, "I am instructed by my government to request you, in accordance with Article 11 of the United Nations Charter, to include the issue of the stationing of troops of member states of the United Nations in the territory of non-enemy countries in the agenda of the second part of the first session of the General Assembly." It is noted that the Security Council previously rejected the inclusion of the Soviet Union's similar motion in the agenda by a vote of seven to two in a meeting in New York.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse London, 5th] The United Nations Narcotics Control Commission is scheduled to hold a meeting here from the 8th to the 15th of this month, which will be chaired by the British representative, Chavini.

<h3>The Permanent Site of the United Nations to Be Decided by the Current General Assembly</h3>
<p>[United Press Success Lake, 6th] The selection of the permanent site of the United Nations organization will be one of the major issues when the General Assembly of 51 countries reconvenes on the 23rd of this month. There is now action behind the scenes to move the headquarters of the United Nations organization out of New York, because representatives of several countries feel that the environment in New York is not very satisfactory. At the last General Assembly held in London, San Francisco lost to New York by a vote of seventeen to twenty-two. Now, it seems that the call for San Francisco as the new site is the highest, and Geneva, which is supported by the Soviet Union, is also likely to be elected.</p>
<h3>China Considers Joining the International Refugee Organization</h3>
<p>Budget of US$160 Million</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Nanjing, 6th] The International Refugee Organization was originally resolved to be established by the Refugee Handling Committee in the First United Nations General Assembly and is still in the preparatory stage. The United Nations Social and Economic Committee recently met at Success Lake in New York, and 18 countries jointly proposed convening an international conference to establish the organization to solve the refugee problem. For this reason, the reporter made a special visit to a relevant person and learned about the situation of the International Refugee Organization being organized as follows: The organization of the International Refugee Organization is based on the General Assembly composed of representatives from the participating countries as the highest authority. The General Assembly elects nine countries to form the Council, publicly elects one chairman of the Council, and hires several secretaries to implement and plan the development of the work. The funds are shared by the participating countries. The original proposed total budget was US$200 million, but the number agreed by the 18 countries has now been reduced to US$160 million. If my country participates in this organization, the originally scheduled allocation was US$4.75 million (excluding the repatriation fee for Soviet Overseas Chinese), and it may have been reduced somewhat now. Our government is considering it, and if it decides to participate in the General Assembly, the candidates for the delegation may be proposed by the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, the Ministry of Social Affairs, and the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration.</p>
<h3>The Peace Conference Vetoes Greece's Request; Athens Strikes to Protest</h3>

<h3>Churchill Reiterates the Eight Major Platforms of the Conservative Party; Developing Foreign Trade, Opposing State-Owned Industries; His Views on Reconciliation with the Soviet Union Coincide with Bevin's</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse London, 6th] The leader of the Conservative Party, former Prime Minister Churchill, delivered a speech at the party's annual conference today, reiterating the eight platforms of the Conservative Party as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Upholding Christianity and resisting all attacks on it; (2) Defending parliamentary government; (3) Ensuring national security from foreign aggression and maintaining the security of maritime trade; (4) Maintaining the absolute independence of the judiciary from any form of interference and oppression; (5) Reforming finance and ensuring strict management of national expenditures; (6) Defending and developing imperial trade, without which Britain cannot survive; (7) Supporting all measures to improve national health and social conditions; (8) Supporting free enterprise and opposing controlled trade and state-owned industries.</p>
<p>Accuses the Government of Hesitation and Indecision</p>
<p>[United Press British Blackpool, 5th] Churchill delivered an important speech at the Conservative Party National Conference here today, contrasting the shrinking territory of the British Empire with the expansion of the Soviet Union's power. He also criticized the Labor government for its hesitation and indecision and its lack of a policy plan for the Palestinian problem. He also darkly predicted that millions of people in India might suffer and bleed. Once India is lost, Burma will immediately fall into the same fate, and the population of the empire will be reduced to a quarter of what it has always been. At the same time, the Soviet Union has absorbed tens of millions of people into its rule, and its national power is still expanding. According to Churchill, although there are many domestic and foreign policy problems in Britain, given his leisurely life, he could have enjoyed the forests and springs. He often thought this way a few months ago, but today, he feels that the situation is extremely serious, and the situation in the future is even more worrying. Therefore, he has decided that as long as his mental abilities are sufficient to support him and he has the trust of the people, he will move forward bravely and be willing to be the first to take the lead. Churchill expressed general agreement with Bevin's policies and is willing to maintain friendly relations with the Soviet Union. His views are also the same as Bevin's. However, he fiercely attacked Prime Minister Attlee's India policy, saying that India is vast and populous. After independence, it will soon secede from the British Commonwealth and become a not very friendly foreign country. The unity created by British rule in India will quickly disappear, and the suffering and bloodshed of millions of people will be immeasurable. According to my plan, India should be given full dominion status, including the right to leave the British Commonwealth entirely. Churchill finally said with emotion that things like this are endless and happen almost every day. A giant ship is gradually sinking in the calm ocean, and those responsible should do their best to make it float, but instead, they open the bottom door to accelerate its sinking. This will leave a permanent mark in history.</p>
<h3>American Super Fortress Successfully Circles the Arctic; From Honolulu to Cairo via the Arctic; The Journey of 10,000 Miles Takes 39 and a Half Hours</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse Cairo, 5th] The wars of the future will be centered on the Arctic. It is still questionable whether giant aircraft can fly freely in the Arctic climate. American aviator Colonel Irvine piloted the "Dream Boat" super fortress aircraft yesterday to test this. It departed from Honolulu, took the "Great Circle" route via the Arctic, and came to Cairo, braving all kinds of dangers. It arrived here at 7:56 AM today, taking 39 and a half hours. Although this flight did not break the recent non-stop flight record of the Navy aircraft "Langui", it has proved that it is possible for giant aircraft to fly across continents via the Arctic.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] London, 6th, Broadcast: The American Army B-29 giant bomber that flew over the Arctic landed in Cairo today, but Zhu could break the record previously set by the American Navy.</p>
<p>[United Press Cairo, 6th] The US Army giant aircraft "Dream Boat" completed its long march across the top of the earth at 8:02 AM today (4:00 PM Shanghai time on Sunday). This test cost the US government US$3 million. However, the records obtained by the crew are of great value to the authorities' plan to send aircraft to regularly fly over the ice zone. The aircraft was commanded by Colonel Irvine and had a crew of ten. When it took off from Honolulu, it carried a record-breaking weight of 144,000 pounds, including 77,352 pounds of gasoline.</p>
<h3>New Hormones</h3>
<p>Discovered by American Biologists</p>
<p>[Associated Press Berkeley, California, 5th] Experimental biologists at the University of California announced today that Professor Evans, Director of the Experimental Biology Institute of the University of California, and his assistant, Dr. Lee, have discovered a "growth hormone" that can develop young rats into giant rats. Evans' research center is the pituitary gland, which is the "control room" of the body. Evans has proved through experiments that only one chemical substance is related to development and that it may be possible to use pure hormones instead of the function of the pituitary gland to promote human development in the future.</p>
<h3>Nehru Meets Gandhi</h3>

<p>[United Press, London, 5th] It is expected that Lord Wavell's term as Viceroy of India will expire in 1948. It is widely speculated that the most likely successor is Stansgate, who recently resigned from his position as Secretary of State for Air. Well-informed observers believe that Mr. Stansgate is best suited for the position in the eyes of the Indian people. It is believed that his resignation was to facilitate his acceptance of the Viceroy's appointment, and the order is expected to be announced in the near future.</p>

<h3>Anglo-Soviet Trade Negotiations Stalled</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent] London, 6th - A broadcast reports that The Sunday Times states that Anglo-Soviet trade negotiations have now completely stalled, and some Soviet representatives have left London to return to the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 6th, United Press] The Sunday Times reports that Anglo-Soviet trade talks have reached a deadlock, and some Soviet experts are returning to the Soviet Union because British manufacturers are almost unable to deliver the machinery and electrical equipment ordered by the Soviet Union within two years. The reason for the delay is that the Board of Trade has no right to prioritize any particular customer in the delivery of industrial products.</p>
<h3>Hull's Condition Slightly Improved, But Not Out of Danger</h3>

<h3>Truman Advocates Establishing a Jewish State, Britain Firmly Opposes, Saying it Will Harm the Palestine Conference</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, London, 5th] President Truman's request for the immediate and large-scale immigration of Jews to Palestine has been personally answered by British Prime Minister Attlee. This was confirmed today by the Foreign Office, which implied that the tone of the note was quite firm, but its contents will not be made public. According to a Foreign Office spokesman, President Truman's move was abrupt and perplexing to Britain. Britain, as the sole administrator of Palestine under the mandate, has no obligation to accept advice from the United States or other outside countries. Meanwhile, in Washington, White House sources claimed that President Truman and Prime Minister Attlee have exchanged secret telegrams on the Palestine issue, but their contents cannot be announced.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 5th] A White House spokesman said today that President Truman's recent statement on the Palestine issue has created a "delicate" situation. According to sources at the British Embassy in Washington, all news regarding the issue is being exchanged directly between Truman and Attlee, or relayed through the US Embassy in London. However, those responsible have confirmed that the British government disapproves of the statement in the strongest terms and views the possible repercussions with great concern. President Truman's move not only undermines the London Palestine Conference but also risks reigniting new and intense actions by Jewish extremists.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Jerusalem, 5th] The Arab Higher Committee for Palestine announced tonight that it will respond tomorrow to President Truman's statement advocating the immediate admission of Jewish immigrants into Palestine.</p>
<h3>The Rope Used for Goering's Execution Was Made by a British Factory Owner; Papen and Two Others Remain Under House Arrest</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent] Paris, 6th - A broadcast from Nuremberg reports that, according to information from London, the rope used to hang Goering and his ten accomplices will be made by the owner of a London factory that was heavily destroyed by the German Air Force.</p>
<p>[United Press, Nuremberg, 5th] Former Nazi leaders Schacht and Fritzsche, who were acquitted by the International Tribunal, secretly left the prison last night and are now hiding in private residences, protected by American and German police, and are forbidden from leaving their homes by order of the military government. Neither is allowed to go outside, as they will be arrested by German police and handed over to the civil court if they appear on the streets. German Police Chief Steer briefly arrested Schacht after midnight last night, but released him because there was no proper arrest warrant. He then attempted to capture Fritzsche, but was also prevented for the same reason.</p>

<h3>Riots in Southern Korea; 10,000 Rioters Participating; Many Police Killed and Injured; US Military Authorities Arrest Leftist Leaders</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Seoul, 5th] The Korean National Police Agency announced today that riots in southern Korea have been ongoing for four days, with 59 police officers killed, 60 injured, and 100 missing. Order is gradually being restored. The rioters, numbering 10,000, burned down the Yeongcheon police station and post office, and seized a batch of firearms and ammunition, but did not disturb the US military. When a large US military force arrived, the rioters fled, taking the dead and injured with them. The US military has declared martial law in the affected areas. According to General Hodge, commander of the US occupation forces, the leaders of the rioters are "foreign conspirators." Korean sources say that communist demonstrators, falsely claiming to represent the US military government, attacked local police. General Hodge's headquarters announced several days ago that it had discovered a conspiracy by individuals in the Soviet-occupied zone to undermine the prestige of the US military and drive them out of the country.</p>

<h3>The Luxurious Life in America (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— (Translated by Yu Jing)</p>
<p>The Privileged Class Spends Money Like Water; Demand Exceeds Supply of Scarce Goods</p>
<p>America's wealth is increasing daily, and past methods of calculation can no longer measure America's money. The American people and property have not become as depressed as generally expected. Statistical curves have all risen. People's needs have surged, food to eat, clothes to wear, books and movies to see, cars and airplanes to ride, buildings to live in, everything is lacking. The entire country is filled with needs, frantically attacking all kinds of stores. No matter what goods are displayed, they are sold out immediately. Mink coats costing $15,000 and men's watches costing $1,000 sell as well as scrambled eggs and spareribs.</p>
<p>The current prosperity is abnormal, completely different from the "prosperity" of peacetime. The market is full of wealth but lacks goods. In fact, the quantity of goods produced is already higher than in the past, but it still presents an unusually scarce phenomenon. Meat, bread, butter, milk, sugar, and lard are all scarce. Lumber, coal, steel, X-ray tubes, sacks, cranes, greenhouses, and lead pipes are also lacking, as are train and plane seats, hotel rooms, and even talent: pharmacists, merchants, veterinarians, carpenters, gardeners, telephone operators, painters, and cooks.</p>
<p>Needs are endless, everyone has money, and no one is going bankrupt. All kinds of businesses are booming. In March of this year, department store sales were equivalent to 263% of the average sales from 1936 to 1939. The New York Telephone Company's classified telephone directory is the largest in history. The number of airline passengers next year is expected to be equal to the number of train passengers in the previous five years. In 1929, the number of workers was 46 million, and now it is only 53 million.</p>
<p>How can these phenomena be explained? In summary, they can be explained in four aspects. There is also a not very reliable speculation, which is that the United States is about to suffer a cyclical panic. When America's wartime production stops, a drastic economic change will inevitably occur. An economist in Washington predicted that the United States will have eight million unemployed, but this panic is only a mystery. The lack of materials has already arrived, and at the same time the lack of labor is becoming increasingly apparent. First, Years of Hard Labor, People are Exhausted</p>
<p>Experts only estimate the material panic, and omit the lack of people. The war suddenly stopped, and people relaxed. Everyone hopes to change the environment and recuperate. The soldiers who went on expeditions have returned home, women have stopped working, many people have changed their professions, many people are traveling and sightseeing, many people are on vacation, many people are being transferred, and many people are practicing sports. In short, there are few producers and many consumers. It can be said that the entire United States is on strike. Workers in various industries have a month of strike leave. American factory manufacturers are surrounded by many people asking for goods, but his factory is stopped due to the strike. This phenomenon is very common.</p>
<p>Let us imagine that in the four and a half years of the war, the American people worked hard with great work efficiency, lacking enjoyment and without vacations. Now that the war is won, who would be willing to cheer a few times and then grab the tools to do hard work? If we understand the drastic changes in American life after the war, the current phenomenon is not surprising.</p>
<p>Economists cannot create a chart to prove that the current situation is a reaction to psychological fatigue, nor can they use an index to calculate how much time Americans need to recuperate, increase enjoyment, and improve entertainment. This is the focus of the current American economic problem.</p>

<h3>Coincidentally, Two Tragic Car Accidents: A Train Crashes into a Large Truck at the Fuxing Road Intersection in Western Shanghai, Six People Killed and Fourteen Injured; A Tram Crashes into a Small Jeep on the Bund</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent] Yesterday morning at around 3:00 AM, the night was deep and the autumn rain was drizzling. A train, No. 805, departing from the Shanghai Meigen Road freight station on the Shanghai-Hangzhou line, collided violently with a ten-wheeled truck (No. 12434) belonging to the Executive Yuan Automotive Assembly Plant, fully loaded with workers, at the intersection of Zhongshan Road and Fuxing Road in western Shanghai. It is reported that the truck was carrying 20 workers and was speeding across the railroad tracks at the time, first crashing into a wooden fence in the dark and then stopping across the tracks. The train was traveling from east to west and was unable to brake in time, causing the truck to be torn in two. The truck driver died instantly. All the other workers in the truck were thrown out of the vehicle for more than ten yards, suffering injuries of varying degrees. Only one person was uninjured. After hearing the news, nearby police officers urgently summoned ambulances to the scene and sent them to the Gongji, Dagong, and Red Cross hospitals for treatment. Among them, five people died due to their injuries being too severe, either on the way or upon arrival at the hospital. Including the driver, a total of six people died tragically. Twelve people suffered minor injuries, and the other three suffered the most severe injuries and are still in critical condition, with their lives in danger. After the accident, the North Station also received a report immediately and dispatched cranes, cleaning vehicles, and small engineering mechanics to lift the damaged vehicles and clear the railroad tracks. Traffic on the Shanghai-Hangzhou line was halted for half an hour as a result. The issue of responsibility for the accident is currently under investigation by all relevant parties. After hearing the news, the families of the victims rushed to the scene of the accident, crying incessantly, and the situation was very tragic. It is reported that the Executive Yuan will provide generous compensation.</p>
<p>[Further Report] As of last night's deadline, of the seven injured being treated at the Red Cross Hospital, one named Shen Guoquan died. The names of the remaining six are Jiang Aqi, Chen Qiangsheng, Xu Yuxiang, Chen Ruisheng, Shan Haosheng, and another whose name is unknown because he was too seriously injured to speak. Those sent to Gongji Hospital for treatment were Liu Xiangru, Yang Wenxing, Feng Genbao, and Zhao Yunbai. The names of the four injured at Dagong Hospital are unknown.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent] Cases of Jeep accidents occur every day. Yesterday, following the tragic train accident, another tragic accident occurred at the intersection of the Bund and Beijing Road at 1:30 PM, in which a small Jeep crashed violently into a tram. It can be said that this was a tragic coincidence. As a result, a US Navy sailor driving Jeep No. 15734 was thrown out of the vehicle and hit his head on the No. A-54 electric pole there, causing his head to bleed profusely and rendering him unconscious. The Jeep he was driving was also severely damaged. The driver's platform of Tram No. 17, which was hit, was slightly damaged, but fortunately no one was injured. After the accident, police officers urgently summoned an ambulance to send the injured to the hospital for treatment, but traffic was blocked for an hour as a result.</p>

<h3>Reconstructing the Qiantang River Ferry: A Fundraising Committee Has Been Established; Shen Honglie Reports on Construction Projects to Fellow Zhejiang Natives</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent] Shen Honglie, Chairman of Zhejiang Province, and Zhang Qiang, Speaker of the Provincial Assembly, along with Directors Ruan Yicheng and Pi Zuohuan, came to Shanghai from Hangzhou on the 4th. In the following days, they contacted various parties regarding the post-disaster relief and reconstruction work in Zhejiang Province. Yesterday afternoon, they had a luncheon with Speaker Pan Gongzhan at the City Council, where they discussed various matters. In the afternoon, they also reached an agreement with Executive Yuan Executive Director Liu Hongsheng. Last night, they were invited by Wang Xiaolai, Chu Fucheng, Xu Jiqi, Ma Wanche, and others, and gave a brief report to their fellow Zhejiang natives at the dinner. The main points were that the Changxing Coal Mine suffered significant losses during the war and it is a pity to stop production. It has been agreed to reorganize the new company with a capital of 2 billion yuan and will start replenishing equipment, with the goal of resuming coal production in seven months. For water conservancy projects, an agreement has been reached with the Relief Administration to use the work-for-relief method, which can be actively implemented. The fishermen in the Dinghai fishing grounds live in extremely difficult conditions, and a request has also been made for the allocation of timber for the construction of fishing boats. The repair of the seawall project is being carried out by Mr. Mao Yisheng, but the funding is still insufficient. This seawall is of great importance to the coastal and riverine areas of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces. Since the Qing Dynasty, it has been regarded as a major national policy and compared to river engineering. It is definitely not something that one province can handle alone, and it is hoped that the central government and overseas compatriots will pay attention to it together. In the future, it is also planned to establish a Zhejiang Provincial Economic Rehabilitation Committee, and it is hoped that the power of officials and people can be gathered to restore vitality to the post-war wounds. That evening, the committee members of the Fundraising Committee for the Reconstruction of the Qiantang River Ferry were appointed and dispersed.</p>

<h3>Internal Affairs Department Chief Ha Xiongwen Arrives in Shanghai, Discusses the Extreme Shortage of Architectural Talent; Two Suggestions to Solve the Housing Crisis</h3>
<p>Mr. Ha Xiongwen, Chief of the Internal Affairs Department of the Ministry of Interior, has been inspecting the architectural industry and various projects in major recovered cities for several months. He arrived in Shanghai yesterday for official business. A reporter made a special visit to inquire about the general situation of China's construction engineering and Mr. Ha's observations on the architectural situation in various recovered cities over the past few months. According to him, China's construction engineering has always been considered backward. The lack of architectural engineers is the main problem at present. Domestically, only a few universities, such as National Central University, Chongqing University, and Sun Yat-sen University, have architecture departments. The number of talents produced each year is very small. With the urgent need to develop the construction industry, this talent is not sufficient to meet the demand. During this inspection of major recovered cities, he promoted the organization of urban planning committees in various cities. So far, Nanjing, Shanghai, Tianjin, and other places have been established. The eight major cities in the rear, Chongqing, Chengdu, Xi'an, Lanzhou, Kunming, Guiyang, Guilin, and Hengyang, had planning committees established during the war. Those still being organized include Qingdao, Guangzhou, Hankou, Nanchang, and other places. In addition, public works committees have been established in major cities, which are jointly composed of institutions such as engineering, public utilities, health, and land administration. In recent years, the chief officials of local governments have paid special attention to engineering and public utility undertakings. This is indeed a major change in Chinese administrative history. Mr. Ha believes that the most gratifying and exciting thing he has gained from the inspection is this point. Because the backwardness of China's construction industry really depends on the wise local government to give practical assistance.</p>
<p>In addition, when discussing the serious housing shortage in various places, Mr. Ha believes that except for the densely populated city of Shanghai, other places are not as serious as imagined. Mr. Ha believes that to solve the above-mentioned difficulties, only two methods can be adopted: First, incentives. Encourage construction. If there are those who automatically build apartment residences, they will be exempted from various taxes, government loans, and access to building materials, etc. Second, compulsory measures. Using political power, it is stipulated that new factories and schools must have sufficient dormitories, otherwise they will not be registered or filed. In this way, the housing shortage problem can be gradually resolved. Mr. Ha came to Shanghai this time to attend the annual meeting of the Chinese Institute of Architects. Mr. Ha is a member of the association and was elected as a standing director of this session.</p>
<h3>City Government Sells Materials Case: Relief Review Shows No Errors; Head of Investigation Team Zhang Zhiben to Go to Capital in Days</h3>
<p>Mr. Zhang Zhiben, head of the Central Receiving Work Investigation Team, is scheduled to go to the capital in the coming days. Regarding the case of the city government's receiving and selling materials from the puppet central market, the investigation team previously transferred the account books to the Shanghai Audit Office for review. It is reported that the Audit Office has prepared a report on the initial investigation results. Cash income and expenditure: More than 3 billion yuan was sold during Mayor Qian's tenure, and more than 1.2 billion yuan was sold during Mayor Wu's tenure. In addition to most of it being used for staff salaries and allowances, it was also used for municipal measures. Currently, there is only 30 million yuan left. The accounts are generally accurate.</p>
<h3>News Veteran Luo Guofu Builds a Defense Line; He Hopes Others Will Bring Him News, But He Doesn't Reveal Even a Drop of Water Himself</h3>
<p>[Special Report from this Newspaper] Luo Guofu, the new General Manager of TASS in China, is a fat, cheerful, and humorous figure.</p>
<p>Before visiting him, I had quite high expectations of "harvesting" something. I wanted to get some opinions and views on the world and China from this leader of the Soviet news agency, who has a considerable history in China and has spent the last few years in the United States and Britain. However, after talking with him, I completely failed. Luo Guofu is indeed worthy of being a "veteran" in the news business. He appears so experienced and alert, and his defense line is so solid that, to put it concretely, "not even a drop of water can seep in." However, on the other hand, he uses witty and humorous words and subtle and interesting actions to make the atmosphere very harmonious and relaxed.</p>
<p>I had heard that Luo Guofu could speak fluent Mandarin, but he spoke to me in English, claiming that he had forgotten Chinese after being away from China for many years. I asked him what his impressions were of returning to Shanghai. He said that he had only been here for five days and had not had time to think about it. I asked him what his opinions were on the current situation in China. He said that this should be reported to Moscow and he did not want to publish it to the press. I asked him what his views were on Britain and the United States. His reply was that it was when the war had not yet ended, and the situation should have changed now. In all the short ten minutes of conversation, the only thing he told me was that the Soviet Union had started another even greater five-year plan, and the Soviet Union, in his view, was "bigger." (Soviet is Bigger)</p>
<p>I gave up the plan to seek other "harvests" and just wanted to take a photo of him as a satisfactory end to the visit. He laughed and said, "I'm not a movie star, no need!" But he finally agreed to my request. He went to the hanger to put on his jacket, tidied his tie, and in the pose of a movie star on camera, he jokingly asked, "Am I handsome?" I laughed, but when the camera was aimed at him, he caused me to laugh uncontrollably with even more humor. He said, "Will any young girls see my picture and like me? Do you think so? Do you think there is any hope?" He said it so naturally and calmly, but in this interesting scene, I seemed so clumsy. I couldn't think of any equally humorous words to answer him for a moment, and only stuttered, "There is great hope, great hope! You still look very young!" This was not just a fabricated compliment, he did look very young, the only difference was that he was a little fat. He continued, "There is great hope? My son is already older than you!"</p>
<p>The conversation ended in a pleasant atmosphere. He smiled and saw me out the door, patted me on the shoulder and said, "I hope you don't ask me for news, on the contrary, I hope you bring me some news!"</p>
<p>(The picture shows a recent photo of Luo Guofu)</p>

<h3>The Properties of Traitor Chen Gongbo and Others Decided to Be Evaluated and Sold First</h3>

The Property Management Bureau has decided: (1) To investigate the situation of these hidden properties and their families, and to first evaluate and sell the properties that have been seized. (2) To announce rewards for confidential reports of the hidden properties of these traitors. (3) To order the property management bureaus and offices in various places to investigate in detail whether these traitors have hidden properties. Among them, although Chuan Xiao'an died before the judgment, his entire property must be declared confiscated separately according to law.</p>
<h3>Love Sea Turns into Sea of Bitterness: Man and Woman Commit Suicide by Poisoning Together</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] In Room 10 of the World Hotel at the intersection of Ninghai West Road and Xizang South Road, a pair of male and female travelers committed suicide by poisoning together at about 8:55 yesterday morning. The man filled in the circulation book with the name Yu Yuangang and the woman's name Wang Caiying, both 21 years old and from Hangzhou. This was discovered by the waiter, who reported it to the Taishan Police Station. They were immediately sent to Nanyang Hospital for emergency treatment. After the doctor gave them injections and gastric lavage, they were saved and their lives are expected to be safe. It is reported that the male and female protagonists are both using pseudonyms. It was found that the man's name is Ling Wangjun, who runs a rubber shoe business, and the woman's real name is Xiu'e, also known as Wanxian. She is already married, but due to incompatibility with her feelings, she fell in love with her boyfriend Ling Wangjun. Their love was extraordinary. Unfortunately, lovers could not become husband and wife, so they pretended to be in an inn and committed suicide together.</p>
<h3>Xu Songshi to Broadcast on the Relationship Between Chinese and Siamese Languages Tonight</h3>

<h3>Posing as Technicians, Japanese Residents in China Are Reluctant to Leave; They Live Comfortably, Do Evil, and the War Criminals Management Office is Ordered to Investigate</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] The War Criminals Management Office of the Ministry of National Defense has recently been assigned the responsibility of managing Japanese residents in China and will conduct a detailed investigation of the tasks of all Japanese residents in China. Those who are not necessary will still be repatriated to their country. Since the victory, in addition to the large number of enemy residents in China who have been successively repatriated to their country, there is still a small number of them who have remained in China under the name of technicians. Including their families, the number is about 3,000. The retention of these Japanese residents in China was initially based solely on a certificate from the employing agency, so the situation is quite complicated. Among them, many are indeed technicians, but there are also those who have no specialized skills and, due to other intentions, are reluctant to leave this land and are active in certain miscellaneous agencies that issue certificates. Since the abolition of the Japanese Residents Management Committee, there has been no unified management agency for these Japanese residents. They are only restrained by the employing agencies themselves, and there is a lot of negligence and leniency, resulting in some living comfortably and others doing evil. And the real technicians also have their work unable to be carried out due to various reasons such as the employing agency's own lack of funds or equipment. Although they have been retained, they have been idle for several months and have been wasting food. Recently, in view of this, the authorities have ordered the War Criminals Management Office of the Ministry of National Defense to manage them uniformly and to conduct strict investigations to prevent abuses.</p>

<h3>Mobile Hospital: Two Routes of Mobile Clinic Vehicles Provide Free Medical Treatment to Employees</h3>
<p>[Special Report from this Newspaper] The Beijing-Shanghai Railway Administration has added a kind of mobile clinic vehicle on the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou lines since September 23, traveling to various stations along the way to provide free medical treatment to those employees who are dedicated to railway work and their families, as well as the road protection security team that protects the safety of the two lines.</p>
<p>This kind of mobile clinic vehicle is a mobile hospital, just like the hospital ships drifting on the ocean during World War II. They bring safety and happiness to people, and the red cross on the car body is a symbol of kindness.</p>
<p>There is one mobile clinic vehicle on the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou lines respectively. Dr. Tang Huimin is in charge of the Beijing-Shanghai line, and Dr. Bi Baoluo is responsible for the Shanghai-Hangzhou line. They are both experienced and familiar with the situation at each station. There are also two nurses and one worker to help on each car.</p>
<p>Although the mobile clinic vehicle is just an ordinary iron-covered vehicle refitted, the internal equipment is quite complete. Almost all kinds of major internal and surgical instruments and medicines are available. The inside of the carriage is all painted white, half of which is the clinic and dispensing room, and the other half is the dormitory and kitchen.</p>
<p>The Beijing-Shanghai Railway Administration has always paid great attention to the medical and health problems of employees. It has successively established railway hospitals in Shanghai, Nanjing, and Qishuyan, and established clinics in Hangzhou, Jiaxing, Changzhou, Suzhou, Zhenjiang, and Xiaguan. The clinic in Hangzhou is preparing to be expanded into a hospital.</p>
<p>As for the mobile clinic vehicle, it is to supplement the shortcomings of the railway hospital and clinic. It is attached to the Shanghai Railway Hospital.</p>
<p>On the Beijing-Shanghai line, it departs from the North Station at 7:30 am on Monday and stops at Kunshan to start service; on Tuesday in Wuxi, on Wednesday in Danyang and Longtan. It returns to Kunshan on Thursday, Wuxi again on Friday, and Danyang and Longtan again on Saturday. It returns to Shanghai on Sunday to replenish medicines.

<h3>Strive for Freedom of the Press! An Open Letter to Commander Xuan from Reporters of Various Newspapers</h3>
<p>Reporters from various newspapers in this city have many difficulties in covering news from the Garrison Command, and even cannot get in. Although they have negotiated many times, it is still ineffective. Therefore, the whole body decided to first send a letter to Commander Xuan, asking for improvement and issuing reporters' entry and exit permits for interviews. The original letter is as follows:</p>
<p>Mr. Tiewu:</p>
<p>We are reporters from various newspapers in this city covering military news. We have unanimously decided that it is necessary to publicly state our request to you. We believe that in this era of freedom of the press, we should serve the society and the people with the heavenly responsibility of news reporters. There is no reason to obstruct and block our interviews. Since you have concentrated the leadership of military and police public security agencies, we have always stood on the side of justice and advocated and promoted various virtues of eliminating violence and maintaining peace, so as to promote its success. We never thought that the Garrison Command would restrict and obstruct our freedom of interview.</p>
<p>I remember that during the tenure of Commanders Qian and Li, guest passes were issued to allow us to freely enter and exit the Garrison Command and go to various places for interviews at will. After you took over, you gradually abolished it. Now we cannot even enter the gate of the Garrison Command. According to the guards, if a reporter is allowed to enter, he will be beaten with fifty military sticks. We do not understand what misunderstandings you have about us, nor do we understand whether this practice is ordered by you or a trick played by others? Commanders Qian and Li once publicly said to us: "The Garrison Command will never close its doors and welcomes reporters to come and give advice at any time." From this point of view, why do you disagree with the enlightened methods of Commanders Qian and Li? We really do not understand. In order to strive for freedom of interview, we have to express our firm opposition and serious protest.</p>
<p>We hope that you can accept our request and issue us entry and exit permits so that we can freely interview. It is true that the Garrison Command is a military agency and has some confidentiality, but the Garrison Command does not have to disclose the part related to military secrets. If there are places where military secrets are published, we reporters are willing to be subject to legal punishment. According to your opinion, it will affect the office if reporters enter and exit freely. Our opinion on this point is to request the Garrison Command to set up a reporter reception room in various places. When we come, we can not go to the office, but meet with the directors of various departments and below in the reporter reception room. At the same time, we also ask you to spare half an hour of time each week to meet with us once. This is our lowest requirement.</p>
<p>As for the news release method implemented by the Garrison Command for a period of time, it is completely in the nature of a bulletin, which is not necessarily what readers like to hear and see. We do not have to specially issue bulletins on behalf of the Garrison Command. We demand that in addition to the bulletins issued to us, we are also allowed to interview freely. This is an obligation and a right for us.</p>
<p>This letter is published simultaneously in national newspapers. We sincerely ask you to publicly answer it. Xu Kailu of Central Daily News, Huang Zhangcai of Peace Daily News, Hu Daozhang of Republic of China Daily News, Zhou Haiping of Xinwen Bao, Jiao Chao of China News Agency, Chen Yinshan of Qianxian Daily News, Zhao Zhicheng of Central News Agency, Peng Junyi of Daguan News Agency, Zhu Zheng of Zhengyan Bao, Shen Yonghui of Yishi Bao, Zhang Shaofu of Dazhong Evening News, Kang Ziyan of Shenshi News Agency, Yang Jiuqing of Qiaosheng Bao, Xu Shoulian of Shen Bao, Cai Fa of Huadong News Agency, Yu Jinhao of Huamei Evening News, Zhu Youci of Ta Kung Pao, Wang Ping of Wenhui Bao, Chen Shiqian of Zhonghua Shibao, Cai Ji of Southeast Daily News, Tang Hai of Xinmin Bao, Zhang Weiwen of Da Wan Bao, and Lu Youluo of Li Bao respectfully on October 6.</p>
<h3>Gangsters Open Fire on Zhongshan Road: Patrol Team Bravely Pursues and Captures</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] The patrol team of the Lijiawan Police Substation under the jurisdiction of the Xinjing Branch of the Shanghai West Police Bureau was patrolling on Zhongshan Road at about 2:00 am yesterday when they encountered three or four suspicious people. They immediately shouted for them to stop. Just as they were about to step forward to check, one of them took the lead and fired a shot, then turned around and fled. The patrol police bravely chased after them and fired several shots in succession, chasing them closely. Finally, they captured one person, Liu Jianping, and seized a live pistol. The rest escaped. They were taken back to the substation and transferred to the Xinjing Branch for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Joint Factory Furnace Explodes: All Chemicals Burned</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] A fire broke out at the United Chemical Factory at No. 5, Lane 324, Haifang Road, at 1:30 pm yesterday. Because the chemicals piled up were all flammable, it was out of control. In addition to the factory and all the chemicals being burned down, it also affected the upper floors of the house at No. 3 next door, causing heavy losses. When the firefighters were putting out the fire, firefighter No. 229 was also burned in the head. The fire was extinguished at about 3:00 pm. It is said that the cause of the fire was due to the furnace being overheated and exploding.</p>
<h3>City Ferry's New Ship Repaired: Hosted a Tour of the Huangpu River Yesterday</h3>
<p>The City Ferry Company's No. 6 (formerly Jiangsu) ferry, which took more than four months to repair, has just been completed and is scheduled to join the Beijing Road to Wusong route starting today. At 2:00 pm yesterday, various circles and news reporters were specially invited to visit and tour the Huangpu River.</p>
<h3>Letter to the Editor</h3>
<p>Yesterday, I read the article "Soldiers Stationed in the Factory Tease Female Workers, Get Angry, and Shoot" in your newspaper. It is not in line with the facts. Please check and correct it accordingly. It was found that not long after the case occurred, an officer was dispatched to the factory to investigate. According to the accountant Lin Chucai and foreman Zhang Menghui, the worker Bao Xingcai (your newspaper mistakenly wrote Pang Shuncai) is from Ningbo, Zhejiang, and Guo Lanxiang is from Jinhua, Zhejiang. The report that they are siblings is not true. However, Bao and Guo have been very close in private, and Guo Lanxiang's behavior is also improper. She often jokes with male workers. Therefore, Guo Xilong, a guard of the fourth company, intervened. Bao Xingcai refused to accept and gathered dozens of workers to beat the guard. The guard was outnumbered and fled to the room to escape danger. Unexpectedly, Bao Xingcai led the workers to swarm and chase after him. During the fight, the guard Guo Xilong lost his freedom and accidentally triggered the gun, which went off and injured Bao's right leg. I hope your newspaper will grant a correction.</p>
<h3>Gunfire Flies in Tongfu Lane: Daytime Robbery; Arrested After Failure; Police Officers Surrounded and Captured Three Robbers</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] At noon yesterday, three armed robbers suddenly broke into the home of Lan Hongquan at No. 27, Tongfu Lane, west of the Grand Theater on Nanjing West Road, and robbed. They first monitored the male and female servants of the Lan residence, and then searched arbitrarily. At that time, the Municipal Police Bureau and the Xincheng Branch under its jurisdiction received a report. The director of the branch, Zhuo Qingbao, personally led police officers to the scene and dispatched police officers to form an encirclement around the lane. One of the robbers was carrying the loot out the door and was captured. The other two robbers, knowing that they had failed, fled to the roof to escape and opened fire to resist arrest. Branch Director Zhuo rushed into the alley, pointed his gun at a robber on the roof and fired a shot. The robber fell down in shock and was injured and captured. Two fake pistols were also seized. The original loot was abandoned in the alley and was also recovered. Subsequently, the police officers conducted a strict search in the lane, and another fleeing criminal was also arrested. The gang of robbers dared to break in and rob in a busy area in broad daylight. It is heard that the police bureau will severely punish them.</p>

<h3>Answering Readers' Legal Questions</h3>
<p>(1) Unilateral Divorce</p>
<p>Chen Rongqing asks: I am originally from Xinghua. In the winter of the 33rd year of the Republic of China, I was persuaded by a matchmaker to marry a Zhu woman in Dongtai County. Ten months after the marriage, I fled to Suzhou due to the war. I repeatedly sent letters home, but received no reply. Now I have learned from relatives and friends that the woman has remarried and destroyed our marriage certificate and proof items. May I ask how to sue according to law? Please give me an answer.</p>
<p>[Lawyer Fu Kuangling replies] Since there is no marriage certificate and no witness to prove it, if you file a lawsuit in court, the judgment will have no basis and you will inevitably lose the case.</p>
<p>(2) Husband's Abuse</p>
<p>Yang Xiu asks: My wife's younger sister, Lu Chaofu, is 22 years old and the same age as her married husband, Hu Deqiu. The two families exchanged children for raising since childhood. At the age of 19, they held a wedding ceremony without a witness. The couple's feelings were harmonious at first, but unexpectedly, after the death of the man's father, he did not engage in proper business, but specialized in gambling and had affairs. His mother also did not discipline him. Moreover, the man's aunt often instigated her nephew to humiliate him for various reasons. The woman's virtue is known to all in the neighborhood. Her husband not only does not listen to advice, but also uses fists and feet, often leaving her covered in bruises. Recently, he has intensified his abuse and drove the woman out, not allowing her to enter the door. The woman could not bear the abuse and complained to her parents, who went to reason with him many times, but her husband avoided seeing them. She wants to divorce her husband, but is prevented by her parents' old-fashioned teachings. I do not know what kind of procedures should be used to allow both parties to divorce? Please advise.</p>
<p>[Lawyer Fu Kuangling replies] If it is as stated in the letter, the man's behavior has constituted a condition for the woman to request a divorce. If the two parties cannot agree on a divorce, they can request a divorce from the court. As for the parents' obstruction, there is no legal constraint.</p>

<h3>A History of the Changing Fortunes of Shanghai Women's Fashion</h3>
<p>— (Special Feature from This Newspaper)</p>
<p>It's already deep autumn. In the city, people are indifferent to the changing seasons, but women in the city seem particularly sensitive, as they've already shed their silk dresses and tried on new outfits. Shanghai is, after all, a big city, and women's clothing changes with each passing day, with new styles emerging constantly. Isn't it comparable to Paris and Hollywood? This year, the windows of fashion stores are filled with even more European and American wool fabrics, making the interest in tailoring new clothes particularly strong. In this season of "when the west wind blows, make winter clothes," let's talk about the "vicissitudes" of Shanghai fashion these days.</p>
<p>Hu Die: A cheongsam without a waistline now feels not very attractive. Just looking at the lace, there's a sense of "congestion" around the neckline.</p>
<h3>The Fashion Trend: A Major Change After the Opening of the Seas</h3>
<p>The rise of fashion is only a matter of the last hundred years or so. A hundred years ago, people had the concept of "make one piece, pass it down for three generations." Often, mothers, daughters, and daughters-in-law would wear the same piece of clothing in turn, regardless of body length or size, whether it fit well, and even less about the material or style of the garment. Since one piece of clothing could be worn for so long, people didn't mind spending extra effort and using wide embroidery and dense edging to show its beauty. Fortunately, women at that time had plenty of leisure time and didn't mind spending a little more time. At the same time, during the imperial era, the attire of titled women was stipulated in law. Even ordinary clothes had considerable restrictions on materials, and styles could not deviate from their status. This was a major reason for maintaining the unchanging styles of women's clothing. After the opening of the seas, foreign materials were imported in an endless stream, dazzling people. Because of the large quantity of imports, the trend became more widespread. Before the Opium War, foreign goods were limited to feather gauze, wool, and the like. Later, there were more and more patterns, and foreign silk, satin, and cotton were much cheaper than domestic silk and satin, and foreign cloth flooded the market. With materials readily available, concepts gradually changed. There was no need to pass down a new garment for generations. Clothes came in different sizes, and the dimensions should fit better. Many time-consuming and labor-intensive edges and borders seemed too cumbersome, and sewing methods also became simpler. At the same time, the import of foreign decorations made styles change even faster. All of these factors contributed to the trend. Shanghai, due to its mix of Chinese and foreigners, took the lead and became an authority on fashion. The so-called "Beijing style" and "Suzhou style" have declined. The "Guangdong style" and "Hong Kong style" of the South can also be said to be a branch of Shanghai. In the last hundred years, Shanghai has been the headquarters for manipulating Chinese women's attire.</p>
<h3>The Evolution of Clothing: Trying on Foreign Clothes in Photo Studios, Bras Overthrowing Corsets</h3>
<p>Before the cheongsam became popular, women wore two-piece outfits, also made of foreign materials, with similar styles. At this time, the real fashion was called "foreign attire," which was completely Western-style clothing. However, it was limited to children's clothing and hats. Although women occasionally wore it, it was only to dress up as a "foreign girl" in the lens of a photo studio. It was rarely seen worn on the streets. It could be seen in places like Shanghai and Hong Kong, but absolutely not in the interior. Later, the trend of studying in Japan became very popular, and Japanese clothing also captivated fashionable women. The popular clothing at the time was narrow and long, with no patterns on the skirt, and its color was dark. Matching it with a watch, oval small blue glasses, and a leather bag and silk umbrella was the most fashionable thing to do. This was introduced by students returning from Japan, indicating that she was a woman with "civilized" ideas.</p>
<p>At that time, the so-called fashion had little impact on daughters of wealthy families, but there were many bizarre and strange outfits in the brothels. At one time, pockets were made on both sides of the trousers, and tassels hung below the pockets. From a distance, it looked like the eyeglass case hanging from the waist of an "old scholar." The straight-front vest, which was originally a Manchu decoration, was also popular for a time after the Republic. Famous courtesans even had a small electric light attached to the collar button, with dry batteries stored in their bosom. When turned on, it emitted a radiant light, making their gaze captivating, which can be said to be beyond imagination.</p>
<p>Bare chests and arms were originally a Western custom. In China, even naturally developed breasts had to be bound. After clothing styles became smaller, corsets replaced the previous bellybands, tightly wrapping the chest, which hindered women's health and affected breastfeeding. However, gradually adopting Western customs, corsets were overthrown and replaced with bras.</p>
<h3>About the Cheongsam</h3>
<p>The popularity of the cheongsam is only a matter of the last twenty years. It started to become popular in Shanghai and gradually flowed into the interior, and now it has become the only clothing for women. However, today's popular cheongsam is only a slight imitation of Manchu attire, and it is very different from the real Manchu cheongsam. According to a record in the "Notes on Shanghai Travels" published in the fourteenth year of the Guangxu Emperor (1888): "In a corner of Yangjingbang, people from all directions gather, and clothing colors change at any time... Women occasionally imitate Manchu attire, which feels refreshing." So, sixty years ago, Shanghai women already had Manchu attire, but it was only an occasional attempt.</p>
<p>The cheongsam has been popular for twenty years, and its length and sleeves have changed countless times. Sometimes it was so long that it dragged on the backs of the feet, and one had to lift the clothes up with each step. Even the young ladies who were idle all day long couldn't bear the hardship. In order to be beautiful, they had to become slaves to their clothes. Later, it gradually became shorter, and now it is almost at the knees, causing the old gentlemen and elders to shake their heads, thinking it was harmful to public morals. The length and size of the sleeves also varied. In recent years, summer clothing has been almost sleeveless, but winter clothing still has long sleeves. However, many modern women still expose their jade arms outside in the cold winter. In China, where heating is not very common, it is somewhat unbearable even indoors. Now, narrow sleeves have been changed to large sleeves, and the west wind blowing in from the cuffs makes it even more unbearable in cold weather.</p>
<p>A Long Vest</p>
<p>At one time, it was popular to add a long vest to the outside of the cheongsam. This was a variation of the Manchu vest. It is said to have been created by the movie star Li Minghui. Someone saw a letter from Li Minghui, which read: "My new clothes have already been made. A long vest and a thin gauze cheongsam. The vest is worn alone over the cheongsam, which is both fashionable and generous. This is my new invention, and no one else has worn it. Would you like to come and see it?" As a result, women imitated it, and it became a fashion trend. Later, it gradually changed its shape. Although the outside was a long vest, the one worn inside was no longer a long cheongsam but a short jacket. Some even made a line of stitching on the shoulder pads to pretend to be a long vest. And it was more tailored than a long vest, so it became one and two, two and one, and could not be restored.</p>
<p>Overseas Chinese Love to Wear Cheongsams</p>
<p>Women wearing cheongsams are not only popular in China but also spread to the United States. A letter from overseas Chinese in San Francisco said: "Currently, Chinese people everywhere use American equipment, but American women love to wear Chinese cheongsams. Chinese women should consider this an unparalleled honor." This was still the case in the 24th and 25th years of the Republic (1935-1936). It is a pity that the War of Resistance against Japan soon broke out, otherwise, it could have been used to promote the sales of domestic silk. Fashion expert Zhang Shuying said: The cheongsam has many advantages and has the same effect as Western clothing. Therefore, the spread of the cheongsam overseas is not accidental.</p>
<h3>Evolution of Clothing Over the Years of the Republic</h3>
<p>What exactly is the change in women's clothing over the years? On February 23, 1936, the Guangzhou women's community held a performance of the evolution of women's clothing over the years of the Republic, which shows the general process of evolution:</p>
<p>Year 1 of the Republic (1912): Old-fashioned wedding dress, crane ceremonial dress, smooth hair with hairpins, jacket and skirt.</p>

<p>Year 25 of the Republic (1936): Fashionable velvet Western-style suit, cheongsam with silver flowers and shawl, long-sleeved cheongsam.</p>
<h3>From Clothing Stores to Fashion Companies</h3>
<p>In the past, clothing stores were the only places to sew fashionable clothes, and women were the major customers of clothing stores. The faster the changes in clothing, the busier the clothing stores became, and the more prosperous their business was. Clothing stores were distributed throughout Shanghai. According to estimates in 1940, there were 2,000 clothing stores in Shanghai, with 40,000 tailors. Including their wives and children who depended on them for a living, there were about 200,000 people in total, which was not a small number. The signs of clothing stores often included the words "Su Guang," which meant that the styles of clothes in Suzhou and Guangzhou were the most fashionable. They were also divided into Suzhou and Yangzhou groups according to locality. Usually, one or two shop assistants plus a few apprentices were enough. The number of people depended on the scope of their business. In the past few years, because of the high cost of living and few jobs, the clothing store business was very quiet. After the victory, those coming from the rear inevitably had to add some clothes, and scissors and needles were seen busy.</p>
<p>Women's outerwear has evolved from silk capes to woolen coats, as mentioned above, and fashion companies have risen in response. Women's coats were initially made by those who specialized in making men's Western suits, and gradually became a specialty of women's clothing. Now, there are many such fashion companies in Shanghai, especially in the Jing'an Temple Road and Tongfu Road area, and the Xiafei Road is also a concentration area of fashion companies. There are also many on the Fourth Horse Road and Hubei Road. The first company to design, pattern, and sew for Shanghai ladies was Yunshang Fashion Company. The founders were all famous figures in Shanghai, such as the socialite Tang Ying, the famous lawyer Jiang Yiping, and the artist Jiang Xiaoyun. Tang was responsible for external publicity, and Jiang was responsible for design and patterning. But soon it was transferred to others, and now Hongxiang Company is undoubtedly the giant.</p>
<p>Mrs. Gu Weijun: Looking at this sketch, you probably wouldn't think that this is the internationally famous Mrs. Gu Shaochuan, would you? Do you think the neckline of her collar is a bit too big?</p>
<h3>Various Coats: American Yellow Wolf, Sable, A Foreign Light Coat Costs 40 Million</h3>
<p>In the cold winter, women often added a cape made of silk. Around 1927-1928, they imitated Western women and changed to wearing coats. The trend spread gradually, and now it is extremely common, and the cape has been completely forgotten.</p>
<p>The initial popularity of coats was only to replace capes for warmth when going out. Later, the styles gradually became more complicated. In addition to winter coats, there were also lined coats for spring and autumn, single coats for when the weather was initially warm or newly cold, and even a white silk coat could be added on summer nights to harmonize colors and increase beauty on top of a long cheongsam. So, these coats were generally decorative items rather than items for warmth.</p>
<p>Fur coats are the warmth items of noble women. Gray-backed sable used to sell for a staggering price per coat. Initially, domestic products were used, transferred from the Northwest through Peiping, and then shipped to Shanghai in boxes. Later, foreign goods were gradually imported. Russian gray-backed sable, American sable, and German rabbit fur were all treasured. German rabbit fur was mostly collected in China, shipped back to Germany, modified by chemical methods, and then shipped back to China. It is said that American sable is also made from Chinese yellow wolf fur, but this year, according to people from Hongxiang Company, the highest-priced fur coat is made of American yellow wolf fur, costing 40 million yuan a piece. Is it one and two, or two and one?</p>
<p>Wool rope was initially used to weave underwear. I don't know who came up with the idea of wearing it on the outside as a coat, and it was actually popular for a while. But it was not as comfortable as wool, so it was not loved by noble ladies and was not very successful.</p>
<h3>Fashion's Moral Crime? The Lewd Thoughts of Rogues!</h3>
<p>In April 1936, the ancient Peiping and Guangzhou, which was the earliest to be contaminated with Western customs, successively implemented bans on strange and exotic clothing to rectify public morals. Strange and exotic clothing encountered unprecedented misfortune. So-called strange clothing and fashion are inherently different. Fashion has been popular for a while, so naturally there is no so-called "strange." However, the strange clothing banned by the authorities was one and the same with fashion. As a result, fashionable women had to hide in their boudoirs and temporarily live the life of a young lady in the eighteenth century.</p>
<p>Is fashion a moral crime? This is very difficult to explain. According to the Guangdong provincial authorities: "Whether the folk customs are simple and pure is closely related to clothing. As the ancients said, protecting treasures teaches theft, and dressing up teaches licentiousness. The clothing of women, although not taking the wide robes and large sleeves of the past as beautiful, does not take the strange shapes of bare chests and arms today as fashionable. Therefore, there is a ban on strange and exotic clothing." What they call strange and exotic clothing actually refers to summer clothing, "Light gauze and silk, muscles are visible, needless to say, and women seek coolness, sleeves do not reach the elbows, collars do not reach the chest, and below the elbows and above the chest are openly exposed."</p>
<p>From May 5th, the Guangdong provincial authorities had female training officers from the Public Security Bureau conduct guidance in the streets and had moral discipline patrol teams inspect clothing. Anyone wearing clothing that violated the standards was immediately corrected. Those who did not comply had a bowl-sized blue stamp placed on their clothes. As a result, fashionable women suddenly disappeared. But at that time, licentious men took the opportunity to make fun of fashionable women, and a "squeezing women" trend occurred in the market. Women in Guangdong Province were deeply dissatisfied with the authorities' measures, considering them an insult, and jointly requested their cancellation. They also expressed opposition to the established standard clothing. At this point, the authorities realized that they had acted too hastily, and the ban gradually relaxed and was finally abolished in an imperceptible manner. At the same time, during the execution of the inspection, those sitting in cars sped by, and the inspectors were actually unable to exercise their powers.</p>
<p>In addition to Peiping and Guangzhou, the banning of strange and exotic clothing has also been implemented in inland cities. Shanghai is worthy of being the fashion center, and the authorities did not ban it. It is difficult to determine to what extent fashion has to be strange to hinder public morals. For example, what Guangzhou banned was bare chests and arms, but in recent years, the summer cheongsams of women not only do not reach the elbows but are shoulder-length, not to mention bare feet, and the toes are painted with nail polish. Then, is hindering public morals going to be further advanced? But compared to Western women, it is still backward. So, this is a question of openness or non-openness. As for the so-called public morals, it is just rogues indulging in lewd thoughts.</p>
<h3>Choosing New Clothes: Pay Attention to Four Key Points: Inappropriate Colors Can Turn You into an Old Hag</h3>
<p>A fashion style, once worn, will quickly spread and soon become popular. Blindly following fashion is a common mistake made by women in the city. They think that everything new is good, without asking whether the style is suitable for their age or whether the patterns match their status. Wearing new clothes is actually an eyesore.</p>
<p>How do you choose clothes? In the past, Mrs. He Jing'an of Zhejiang University proposed four key points to consider when tailoring clothes. First, it must be based on the wearer's attitude, that is, it must show their identity after wearing it. It can be divided into the noble school, the sports school, the spoiled school, the mother school, the comedy school, the mysterious school, and the fun school, and so on. Second, the clothes should fit the body. The length and size of each part of the body are different for each person. When tailoring, you must examine the beauty and ugliness of each part of the wearer's body to make the beautiful points more obvious and the ugly points hidden. Third, consider the wearer's occupation. In the past, the clothes of noble women and prostitutes were the most novel, but there was still a clear distinction between them. Later, they began to blur the lines, and this point should be paid the most attention. Fourth is the age of the wearer. Younger people should wear bright colors, and older people should wear solemn colors. If a woman with wrinkled skin and white hair wears delicate clothes, won't she become an "old hag"? On the other hand, if a young person wears the clothes of an older person, it will reduce their charm. Even young people and middle-aged people are different, and the situation is even more different before and after marriage.</p>
<p>The color and pattern of the clothes should be based on psychology. People with tall figures look even taller when they wear clothes with vertical stripes, and short people look even shorter when they wear clothes with horizontal stripes. Stripes can cause a visual illusion. Solid-colored clothes are suitable for petite people but not suitable for fat people. Fat people wearing solid-colored clothes will only make them look fatter. Because simple colors always show a shadow next to them. Colors are divided into light and dark. Light colors are more delicate and are worn by young people. The higher the age, the darker the color should be.</p>
<p>Where are the Winter Clothes?</p>
<p>Noble women are planning the styles of their new clothes this year. Stores are already lined with various silks and wool fabrics. Even though a suit costs millions or tens of millions, there will be no one who doesn't ask. But ordinary citizens find it quite difficult to deal with cloth costing thousands of yuan per foot and clothes costing tens of thousands of yuan a suit. In today's soaring prices, it is difficult to maintain even the lowest standard of living. The meager income of a month is not even enough to buy firewood and rice, so how can they talk about adding new clothes? So, new clothes are prepared for the rich, and let them decorate the prosperous city.</p>

<h3>Port Restrictions on Hardware Exports to Guangzhou Cause Vehicle Prices to Soar</h3>
<p>[Guangzhou Shipping News] The Hong Kong government's restrictions on hardware exports have recently become even stricter. Hardware and metal equipment in this city, such as automobile parts and bicycle (i.e., pedal bike) parts, are extremely expensive. According to Hong Kong travelers, bicycles in Hong Kong are not expensive. Brands like "Customer Road Brand" and "Zili Pu Brand" bicycles are worth less than 200 Hong Kong dollars, equivalent to about 140,000 in national currency. Currently, in this city, they are worth more than 400,000.</p>
<h3>Production Loans Tightened, Industrial, Mining, Agricultural, and Salt Loans Continue as Usual</h3>
<p>The Four Allied Branches recently announced a sudden tightening of general loans, leading to some criticism. According to the authorities in charge, loans for necessary industrial, mining, and transportation production projects will continue to be handled as ordered. Agricultural and salt loans already in progress are also being handled as usual because banking operations have been established. However, production loans for other departments will be tightened across the board, following the instructions of the head office.</p>
<h3>The Current Situation of the Hongye Brick and Tile Factory in the Capital</h3>
<p>By Feng Ku</p>
<p>The construction industry in our country made rapid progress before the war. Among the materials needed, besides cement, steel, and wood panels, bricks and tiles were the main items. In the past, enthusiastic industrialists purchased mountain land in the suburbs of the capital, outside Zhonghua Gate and Heping Gate, and used the mountain soil to organize brick and tile factories, or small-scale brick kilns, numbering several dozen.</p>
<p>When the Japanese invaders occupied the capital in the winter of 1937, they established a blockade line north of the railway outside Heping Gate and stationed troops in the major kilns, causing these kilns to close down one after another, resulting in heavy losses. Now that victory has been achieved for a year, both public and private buildings in the capital have been destroyed, making it difficult to rebuild. The sales of bricks and tiles are sluggish, and the fuel (coal) needed for the kilns cannot be supplied in a timely manner. Currently, the smaller kilns remain closed. The larger ones are struggling to recover. Apart from the Jinghua factory outside Zhonghua Gate, the Yihe Dong factory outside Heping Gate, and the Tianjin Three Kilns, which require separate investigation for further details, the current situation of the Hongye Brick and Tile Factory in Huangjiawei outside Heping Gate is briefly described as follows.</p>
<p>Founding Figures The Hongye Brick and Tile Factory was initiated and organized by General Gu Mosan and others around 1933 and 1934. Many investors were military and political figures. If the war had not occurred and the Japanese invaders had not destroyed it, the development over the past nine years would have been considerable.</p>
<p>Kiln Structure The factory site is located on a mountain slope northeast of Heping Gate (named Huangjiawei). From a distance, it looks very grand, with a chimney as high as 800 feet, standing straight into the sky. The internal structure is modeled after German kiln factories. Inside are 34 doors, each with a small hole (covered with a coin) for adding coal. The entire kiln is heated by fire dragons. The smoke passes through the fire dragons and exits through the chimney. The green bricks and tiles are placed inside the kiln door, which is sealed with mud to prevent ventilation. They must undergo a very high temperature for a certain period before being taken out as finished bricks and tiles.</p>
<p>Convenient Railway The factory previously used a single-track railway about three miles long for transporting raw and finished bricks and tiles in and out of the factory. Manual transportation would have been very inconvenient. The railway ran north to the factory and south to the vicinity of the Jinghu Railway. Dozens of sheds were built on the left side of the road for workers to manufacture brick blanks.</p>
<p>Machine Theft The raw materials for the factory's bricks and tiles were local soil, which was very sticky. They used to be manufactured with German machinery, which could produce about 40,000 brick blanks and about 60,000 tile blanks per day. Before the Japanese invaders surrendered last year, they secretly stole and sold all the machinery, resulting in incalculable losses. When the factory resumed operations in April this year, they tried to track down the machinery, but to no avail. They have now resorted to the old method of hiring workers to manufacture brick blanks by hand, but they cannot manufacture foreign-style tile blanks.</p>
<p>Demolished Houses The factory had over a hundred rooms for manufacturing brick blanks on the left side of the railway south of the factory. After the Japanese invaders moved in, they demolished over seventy rooms. The office buildings and workers' dormitories on the right side of the railway, facing south and east, looked intact from the outside, but upon closer inspection, all the partition walls had been altered and repaired. The doors and windows, and glass, had been completely demolished.</p>
<p>Current Work Status The workers are divided into three groups: blank making, firing, and transportation, totaling over two hundred people. Each group has an assistant to manage the workers. Most workers are paid in goods. Blank-making workers who make about 2,000 brick blanks per day are paid about 150,000 yuan per month. Transportation workers are paid about 200,000 yuan per day. Other workers, such as those who tend the fires, are paid daily and work in two shifts, day and night. Nine-tenths of the workers come from various counties in northern Anhui. This year, they suffered from both floods and locust plagues, and the spring harvest was poor, making it impossible to make a living. About twenty people come from Taixian and Huaian counties in northern Jiangsu.</p>
<p>Current Profits The cost of producing 10,000 finished bricks is about 500,000 yuan, and they are sold for over 1.2 million yuan, with a profit of more than double the cost. Unfortunately, the construction industry is still in a slump. So far, the capital has not been able to launch large-scale projects. Otherwise, the development of the kilns would be difficult to predict.</p>

<h3>Yuan Tongli Passes Through Kunming and Flies to Beijing</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Kunming, 6th] Yuan Tongli, director of the National Peiping Library, was previously sent by the government to lecture in Europe and the United States and to attend the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) conference.

<h3>President Wu Youxun of Central University May Rescind His Resignation</h3>
<h3>Likely to be Succeeded by Jiang Tingfu</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 6th] Central University is scheduled to start classes on November 1st, with classes for the third and fourth grades. It must be in the latter half of the month. Freshmen will start classes as late as December. President Wu Youxun is currently on leave, and his resignation may be rescinded; it is said that he will be succeeded by Jiang Tingfu.</p>
<h3>Statistics on Guangdong University Students Show Law Students Account for the Largest Number</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Guangzhou, 6th] According to recent statistics, there are 10,894 students in Guangdong Province's four universities and five colleges. Among them, law students account for the largest number, with 3,746 people. Next is literature, followed by commerce, engineering, science, and agriculture. Medicine has the fewest students, with only 500 people.</p>
<h3>Entrance Examinations for Returning Students from Six Universities in Sichuan to be Held Before the 15th</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 6th] More than twenty representatives of returning students from six universities in the rear, including Sichuan University, Chongqing University, Yunnan University, Guizhou University, Guiyang College, and the Medical College, petitioned the Ministry of Education regarding transfer requests. The Ministry of Education has ordered universities in the Nanjing area to hold a special transfer examination. Previously, Central University, Jinling University, and the Social Education School held a meeting to establish a joint enrollment agency. The student representatives from the six universities recently went to the Ministry of Education to request five points: (1) Expedite the examination, (2) Please exempt the entrance examination for freshmen (except for the transfer examination, exempt the so-called entrance examination for freshmen, because the entrance examination for freshmen also requires testing various courses from high school graduation). (3) Please conduct a screening process, not a freshmen examination process. (4) If they fail the examination, please order the schools to allow them to attend as auditors. (5) If they cannot be admitted, please have the Ministry of Education issue travel expenses to return to their original schools to continue their studies. The Ministry of Education replied yesterday (the 5th) that regarding the expedited examination, President Tang of Central University has reported to the Ministry of Education that the transfer examination for returning students from the six universities in the rear will be held before the 15th of this month. The remaining issues, and the issues related to point (2), are because Central University, Jinling University, and other universities still hold freshmen entrance examinations in addition to transfer examinations for transfer students. Although Vice Minister Hang expressed leniency, each school has firmly established rules that cannot be broken, and the Ministry of Education is not in a position to forcibly change the established rules. This matter is difficult to meet the students' requests. As for the auditing issue, because schools have canceled this system after the war, it is also feared to be difficult to handle.</p>

<h3>A Contest of Endurance and Stamina</h3>
<h3>Qunsheng Defeats Hualian by Six Points</h3>
<h3>47-41 Tense Situation in the First Half, Only One Point Difference</h3>
<h3>Qunsheng Wins Nine Out of Nine Games in the Second Half</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The Qunsheng basketball team continues to maintain its winning record with nine wins out of nine games. Last night, in an extremely tense situation, they defeated the local champion Hualian team again. The result was 47 to 41, with Qunsheng winning by only six points. In the first half, Qunsheng led by only one point with 23 to 22, which shows how fierce and tense the competition was. The enthusiasm of the audience last night remained undiminished. The gymnasium was packed, with more than 5,000 people. People started lining up to buy tickets as early as 2:00 p.m., and the gymnasium was full by 5:00 p.m. To promote sports, the China Electric Power Second Factory was specially invited to send personnel to the factory to film newsreels, which added a lot of color to the competition. The fans could not be turned on due to power issues.</p>
<h3>Awarding Ceremony Held</h3>
<p>Before the match, Hualian presented a banner as a memorial. During the break, Qian Dajun, chairman of the Municipal Sports Association, presented a golden statue on behalf of the Basketball Committee, which was received by the captain of the Qunsheng team. The local sports reporters' association also held a flag presentation ceremony yesterday, with Qunsheng and Hualian each presenting a banner to commemorate the occasion. Qian Dajun, chairman of the Sports Association, was also invited to present the banners.</p>
<h3>Zhenzhong Performs Excellently</h3>
<p>Although Hualian lost last night, their performance was much improved compared to before, especially Li Zhenzhong, who was outstanding. He directed the offense skillfully and had very accurate long-range shots, scoring the most points. Unfortunately, his stamina was insufficient. Wu Chengzhang was young and strong, and individually he was no less skilled than the Qunsheng players. In the first quarter, Hualian led by one point with 8 to 6. In the second quarter, the score fluctuated, and they were close to each other by one point. Hualian failed to maintain this situation in the second half, which was a pity. Qunsheng, on the other hand, was slightly flustered due to the tension in the first half, and their play was disjointed. They gradually gained momentum in the second half, and the fourth quarter was smooth sailing. Their skilled passing and offensive performance earned cheers and applause from the audience.</p>
<h3>Hualian Suddenly Takes the Lead</h3>
<p>The match last night was played in four quarters, with Wang Shoufang and Hong Lu serving as referees. The visiting team still used the five-tiger lineup of Cai Wenhua, Cai Wenzhang, Chen Jinzhi, Chen Jinde, and Yang Renhui. Hualian sent out Li Zhenzhong, Chen Xuechong, Wu Chengzhang, Bao Songyuan, and Kong Guangyi. As soon as the whistle blew, the battle began. Zhenzhong's first shot bounced off, and Qunsheng also had no chance to score. After a long scramble, Jinzhi dribbled and shot, but Akong fouled him. Jinde scored on two free throws, opening the scoring. Then Chengzhang followed up under the basket, tying the score at two each. Jinde scored again, and Wenzhang jumped up and shot. With the score at five to two, Hualian called a timeout. As expected, Wenhua fouled, and Zhenzhong made two free throws. Jinde made a free throw, and Zhenzhong scored a clean shot, tying the score at six each. Qunsheng called a timeout, Zhenzhong scored again, and the first quarter ended, with Hualian taking a one-point lead at eight to six.</p>
<h3>Score Fluctuates Wildly</h3>
<p>After a short break, the game resumed, and Jinde scored first with an open shot, tying the score again at eight each. The situation fell into fierce fighting, and the score fluctuated wildly. Hualian led with 13 to 10. At this point, Zhenzhong left the field and was replaced by Liangxiong. The lineup loosened, and Wenzhang, Renhui, and Wenhua scored three consecutive points, suddenly taking a lead of 16 to 10. Hualian had no choice but to call a timeout. As expected, it was effective. Adi and Liangxiong each made wonderful shots, and Wenhua and Jinde also had clever moves, each showing their talents. At the end of the first half, Qunsheng led by only one point with 23 to 22.</p>
<h3>Hualian Overtakes Again</h3>
<p>After the break, Qunsheng still used the old lineup, while Hualian rested Xuechong, and Zhenzhong returned to the field. Renhui and Chengzhang both fouled twice, each scoring one point. Akong and Jinde followed suit, also scoring one point each. Zhenzhong then scored a long-range shot, and Hualian took a one-point lead with 25 to 24. At this point, Qunsheng gave a loud shout. With their stamina being sufficient, Hualian gradually became weaker in terms of strength, and with bad luck, Qunsheng quickly scored to make it 36 to 26. Hualian was defeated during this period. One minute before the end of the third quarter, Zhang Yuyi</p>
<h3>Qunsheng Quickly and Steadily</h3>
<p>In the final quarter, Hualian used all their remaining strength to launch a full-scale counterattack. Qunsheng combined speed and stability. There were many fouls in the last three minutes, but Qunsheng won the ball and gave up shooting. Hualian also sacrificed one point and made a long-range shot. Amidst the repeated graduation cheers of Akong and Wen Hua, Li Zhenzhong scored a long-range shot. The bell rang repeatedly, and the scoreboard showed 47 to 41, with Qunsheng defeating Hualian by six points.</p>

<h3>Grand Basketball Event</h3>
<h3>Glorious Achievements in the Southwest Campaign</h3>
<h3>The Conquering Basketball Team Arrives in Luzhou</h3>
<h3>To Make Their Debut Before the Double Tenth Festival</h3>
<p>The Sixth Regiment of the Army Transportation Corps Conquering Basketball Team, a group of ten people, led by Lieutenant Colonel Wu Zhuoming, the team leader, left Beijing by car at 9:00 a.m. the day before yesterday and arrived in Luzhou at about 4:00 p.m. They immediately checked into Room 102 of the Xiang Sheng Hotel. The team departed from Luoyang on the 13th of last month. They stayed briefly in Dengzhou and competed once with Dengzhou. They then went to Hankou, where they played four games and won all of them. On the 2nd, they left Hankou by the Lingyun and arrived in the capital at about 8:00 a.m. the day before yesterday. They will stay in Luzhou for two weeks. Team leader Wu met with Qian Xucang, chairman of the local Basketball Committee, yesterday to discuss plans to make their debut on the 9th (Wednesday), first playing against the Lianghua team and guiding Sheng to return to Luzhou for a match, but this still awaits a final decision by the Basketball Committee.</p>
<p>The Conquering Team, after returning from India in victory, was first invited by various circles in Luoyang to have friendly matches with teams from South China Province and Xunguo, laying the foundation for victory. Then, they were transferred to the Northwest with the country, passing through Chongqing, and were warmly welcomed by countless audiences. They fought continuously with more than ten teams, including Central University, the Central Political School, Central Cadre, Qixiong, Hanyu, Lianghua, the Fourth Motor Battalion, Tianjian, and Chongqing University, and won every time. They were not arrogant or impetuous. Although they only had seven brave generals, they were tall and strong, lived a regular life, and were willing to endure hardship. When they arrived at Baoji, they participated in the Thirteenth and Twenty-ninth Youth Day Championship Basketball Tournament and were invincible. When Xi'an heard the news, they invited them to participate in the basketball game to raise funds for the Sports Association, and performed with teams such as the Military Headquarters, Business School, Shishou, Xiyou, Xijing, Shiyou, and Lions, winning all fourteen games. They departed from Luoyang on September 13th to visit Luzhou, passing through Zhengzhou and having a small match with Zheng Lian. After arriving in Hankou, they played four games against Wanxing, Youlian, the Air Force Headquarters, and the Wuhan United Team, all achieving brilliant results.</p>

<h3>Table Tennis League Concludes</h3>
<h3>General Championship Won by Huxing</h3>
<p>The inaugural Shanghai Table Tennis Tournament held its final at 6:00 p.m. the day before yesterday in the basketball room of the Municipal Gymnasium. More than 3,000 spectators attended, and the enthusiasm was high, a rare spectacle for a table tennis tournament. Chen Linsheng, Chen Jimao, Li Longbiao, and Hu Jiankun served as referees for the two matches. In the first match, Huxing Jingwu met. Wang Youxin, Fu Qifang, and Lu Hanjun of Huxing were like fierce tigers, unstoppable. Jingwu lost five consecutive matches and was completely defeated. After Huxing defeated Jingwu, they then fought Guangdong to win the championship. Guangdong relied on their main player Ouyang Wei to defeat Li Zongshi, the all-around player from Huxing. However, the team members were not as good as Huxing's average. After that, all four groups failed, and Huxing ended with a score of 6-4, winning the overall championship of this league. Guangdong retreated to the overall runner-up. After the game, General Manager Chen Linsheng and Committee Member Wang Yizhi delivered closing speeches. Finally, Miss Wang Xuecheng presented the awards, and the representatives of each team received the awards and retired amidst enthusiastic applause. The league came to an end.</p>

<h3>Atlantic City: A Surge of People</h3>
<h3>The Annual Selection of the Queen</h3>
<p>[New York Shipping News, September 20th, Our Newspaper] By Mao Shuqing, Special Correspondent in the United States</p>
<p>Just two weeks after the Shanghai Miss Election, Atlantic City in the United States, with its beautiful scenery, is experiencing its annual frenzy season, the election of the "Miss America" for 1946.</p>
<p>People flooded into this seaside summer resort like a tide. It was already shortly before the Mid-Autumn Festival, but in the United States, they still call it "Midsummer." The American summer ends on September 20th. Their calendar is based on the crystallization of experience accumulated by many Chinese people, isn't it? On the day the Queen's election was announced, the sun was still shining like fire on the blue sea.</p>
<p>The election lasts for a week. Before the scheduled election date, the "Queens" of each state and special city arrive in Atlantic City one after another. For more than twenty years, the annual Queen's election has been held in Atlantic City. It is said that several capitalists who initiated the "beauty contest" love the scenery of this small city, so they decided on the good fortune of this "sacred place". This was my first time going to Atlantic City from New York. I can't say that the small city is "unlovable". It is quiet, elegant, with hundreds of summer resorts, upscale theaters, and entertainment facilities, as well as a natural blue sea. Someone once proposed to set up the new agency of the United Nations in Atlantic City. Later, they felt that it was not as convenient as New York, so it was shelved.</p>
<h3>Participation in the Election is Limited to Female Students</h3>
<p>I didn't arrive in Atlantic City until the day before the announcement and it took a lot of effort to find a hotel. I didn't see the beauty pageant parade of the "Misses". It is said that this year's was more exciting than in previous years. Their procession crossed the streets of Atlantic City, and the audience surged in like crazy. Those who liked to "judge" began to predict: Chicago's girl is too small, Illinois' girl is too weak, Tennessee's girl is too tall... Like gamblers who bought lottery tickets, everyone had a draft in their minds. No one in the audience didn't expect their inner lottery ticket to win.</p>
<p>Old men and old women also crowded to watch the excitement. They put on their "old-fashioned glasses" and couldn't help but sigh: "They are all top-notch good girls, all beautiful!"</p>
<p>That's right, none of the fifty contestants were not beautiful. If they weren't beautiful, they wouldn't be elected as representatives of each state and special city. The strictness of the preliminary elections in each state is no less than the national final election. According to the election law, only American female students who are studying are allowed to participate in the Miss America election. Before the preliminary election, female students in each city and town who think they meet the standards of "beauty" voluntarily sign up. There are hundreds of people who sign up for the preliminary elections in each state. Then, the first step is a medical examination. Misses with lung diseases, like Lin Daiyu who "spit green phlegm", will be eliminated in the medical examination, no matter how beautiful they are. The second step is to look at the height and width, and whether the numbers of obesity and weight are symmetrical. Those whose body is too long and thin and exceeds the limit of "slim", or whose body is short and fat and exceeds the limit of "full", will be eliminated in the second step. The third step is to look at the appearance and skin. After the preliminary election and re-election by aesthetic experts and physical examination doctors, most of them have been eliminated.</p>
<h3>Eleven Misses Participate in the Final</h3>
<h3>Showcasing Their Skills on Stage</h3>
<p>I went to Washington in mid-August. Mr. Lin Qizhi, the secretary of the embassy, ​​invited me to see a movie. Inadvertently, I happened to encounter the final election in Washington, D.C. There were eleven Misses in the final election. Each of them showed off their "formal dress", "casual dress", and walking posture on stage. The so-called formal dress is wearing a long-sleeved dress, like an ancient Chinese beauty. The so-called casual dress is showing the thighs and bust, showing the so-called "curves" of American women. Then, everyone does some entertainment, singing, dancing, or playing the piano. See the extent of the crowd's applause, which one do they like? There are nine judges, four of whom are local news reporters, one music expert, one aesthetic expert, and two others who are probably "celebrities" in Washington, D.C.</p>
<p>In the preliminary and final elections in Washington, the judges almost completely followed the extent of the crowd's applause. That day, Miss Jennie Carlson wore a black gauze dress, a farmer's hat, and sang a very "naughty" song: "Do it, just let it be!" She grabbed the edge of the hat with both hands, stretching her head, which was very lovable. At least, in the eyes of Americans, they loved her very much. As a</p>

<p>On Bureaucracy  Shao Fu</p>
<p>Jiang Tingfu's departure from the position of Director-General of the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (CNRRA) has sparked much discussion. The promotion, transfer, and appointment of personnel by the administrative authorities are subject to their own considerations, and we do not wish to comment on them. However, the fact that a group of his senior cadres in the CNRRA resigned one after another after his departure demonstrates that we are still some distance from the rule of law, due to the feudalistic idea of "a new dynasty with each new emperor" in human governance.</p>
<p>Let us imagine, can the CNRRA still function as an organization with the departure of such a long list of senior officials, from deputy director-general, directors of various departments, chief secretary, director of personnel, secretaries to executive officers? What can it accomplish? We dare not say this is sabotage, but we believe it will at least affect the progress of the CNRRA's work. Because, even if the newly appointed Director-General brings a large number of so-called core members, it is unknown how long it will take to become familiar with the actual situation of each department's work. Relief work prioritizes time, so who suffers from this wasted time? And who should be responsible?</p>
<p>If Mr. Huo Binshu were to take office with only a single horse and a bedroll, like Mr. Gu Chunfan, the Director of the Municipal Finance Bureau, wouldn't he be at a loss?</p>
<p>If cliquism centered on individuals, as well as the concepts of "cadres" and "core members," are not eradicated, we dare to assert that China's political future will not be able to make great progress.</p>
<p>Random Thoughts, Shouting for the Unsung Heroes  Shengjie</p>
<p>Although I am not a hero who has been on the battlefield for a long time, I am indeed a soldier who has traveled across half of China. For eight years, I have lived a military life. I have also been praised by millions of people and have received many glorious titles. However, things are different now, and many things are heartbreaking! Therefore, I have left the army and returned to school.</p>
<p>I think victory should not dilute the bloody memories of the past eight years. "Demobilization" should not completely forget the vanguards who were once praised by everyone! Even if the early end of the war was due to the atomic bomb, does the atomic bomb completely erase the flesh and blood of the "soldiers"?</p>
<p>In the short year since the victory, the fate of the "soldiers" has been like stray dogs on the street, ignored and scolded. Since the downsizing and reorganization of the army, a large number of officers have lost their jobs and have no way to make a living. Consequently, those who once fought on the battlefield are now begging on the streets. In Changzhou, some major and captain-level officers even put their commissions and medals on the road, asking passers-by for money. Throughout history, both in China and abroad, there has been no greater injustice than this!</p>
<p>Later, relief measures came, and the Officers' Corps was established. It was willing to accommodate demobilized officers, but the registration procedures were not only troublesome, but the review was even more strict! Often, many officers use the "severance pay for those laid off" to maintain their hotel living, but the efficiency of the registration work is too poor. As a result, these "soldiers" wait until they can no longer afford the hotel expenses, and the review has not yet been completed. Therefore, suicides and deviant behaviors are often heard of. The public is very vague about these inside stories. All they see is that soldiers refuse to buy tickets on buses, and all they emphasize is that soldiers refuse to buy tickets for movies. But you also think about it: why are they like this? After fighting for eight years, they are left with nothing. Watching a free show is certainly "illegal," but if we think about it, we shouldn't attack them too much!</p>
<p>As for the honored veterans, they are also equally miserable! A letter about honored veterans begging was published in "Free Talk" the other day. Everyone should be moved after reading it. They lost their legs and arms fighting against the enemies of the country, but because times have changed, no one pays attention to them anymore. Does this era, does this society, have no rationality left at all?</p>
<p>Speaking of the treatment of soldiers, a general gets 250,000, which is not even as much as a worker in a bank. At the very least, officers only get 40,000 or 50,000. Soldiers are even more pitiful, with squad leaders getting no more than 10,000 or 20,000, and privates getting less than 10,000. How will they live, how will they survive? We really can't bear to describe it any further!</p>
<p>Even if the senior officers and generals are comfortable, countless soldiers are still supporting the War of Resistance. Their names are not seen in the newspapers, and their names are not seen on the medal lists. They are the unsung heroes who directly contributed to the War of Resistance. Those who sacrificed are gone, and those who are alive receive only coldness and contempt. There is such injustice in the world, it is really speechless!</p>
<p>I am not shouting for soldiers because I was once a soldier myself, but because I am a Chinese and I feel threatened, I dare not remain silent; I want the government to come up with a solution! I want the public to look at us with "serious" eyes!</p>
<p>Corruption, Get Out of Schools  Yu</p>
<p>During the summer vacation, I attended summer classes at school. More than 30 of my classmates were graduating students from a famous private university in the city. One night, I learned a secret:</p>
<p>These out-of-town students came to study through the arrangements of a student surnamed Fan from the Department of Political Science. The school stipulated that each person pay 30,000 for each subject, but this student was not polite and added 10,000. For more than 30 people, two subjects each, he easily pocketed 600,000 or 700,000. Coincidentally, one student paid late, and this matter was exposed. However, there was an even stranger thing later. I personally saw a student come to the school to inquire, but the accountant in charge refused to answer immediately and instead went to discuss it with that student. Because I was not in that school, I did not hear the outcome, but it can be seen that the incident did not escalate. I have to admire his ability to control the situation. This is one thing.</p>
<p>This semester has already started. At the end of September, the dormitory elected a dorm head. There were six candidates in total. The dorm head reported to the school that he was elected with five votes. But I clearly know that among the six people, one abstained and one was out and did not participate, and the elected candidate did not vote for himself. Where did the five votes come from? I announced it to the students, but everyone was unwilling to speak out because of "friendship." This is another thing.</p>
<p>Are these two things trivial? From this, can I see that the darkness of China's future is just beginning? Will this student from the Department of Political Science not engage in corruption when he enters the political arena? Will this student who did not pursue the matter because of "friendship" not engage in corruption? I am really surprised that these students usually scold corruption and those who protect corrupt officials, but they cannot see the facts in front of them, or they see them but do not care. I would like to ask: educators who run schools, are these trivial matters worth paying attention to?</p>
<p>Schools are ideal institutions and should not be so dirty! We can't help but shout: corruption, get out of schools!</p>
<p>Movie Theater Owners, We Appeal to You  Li Wei</p>
<p>We are the "early to rise and late to bed" working class, we are civil servants, office workers, students...</p>
<p>We have to work during the day, and after a day's fatigue and a week's hard work, we hope to get some "enjoyment" and "spiritual comfort"; therefore, we "patronize" your "treasure shop."</p>
<p>"Every night show and weekly holiday, the ticket price is 3,000, 3,500, 4,000." Why increase the price? Three thousand yuan can pay for two days of meals. How can "poor scholars" dare to "indulge"? And the time is 9:15, and the show ends at least 10:45. When we get home, there are no trams, and we have already paid a considerable sum to you, and we have no money to take a rickshaw.</p>
<p>Therefore, we appeal to you:</p>
<p>1.  Increase the proportion of ticket prices a little. Sell the best seats for more money. The rich don't care about spending 10,000 yuan, but the poor have to think about spending 1,000 yuan. Averaging this proportion will not be more disadvantageous to you than it is now. It will still be full.</p>
<p>2.  Start the show earlier! Open and close the late show earlier. Your "staff" can also "rest" earlier, and we can also have a "ride" and save on rickshaw fare, so we can "patronize" one more time!</p>
<p>Movie theater owners: do the math!</p>
<p>American Style  Liang</p>
<p>American ethics and China have obvious differences. Even based on their usual calling habits, one can gain a deep understanding.</p>
<p>If you go to America for the first time, you must understand how they like to be addressed. At first, of course, you can use titles like "Mr.," "Dr.," "Mrs.," "Miss." But if you see them often, you should no longer use these titles. Even if you are addressing their "wife" or "lover," you can just use their first name. Otherwise, you are deliberately distancing yourself from them.</p>
<p>Americans often use a part of their first name to address others, to show intimacy. For example, Johnson is called Jon, Robert is called Rob, William is called Bill.</p>
<p>The strangest thing is that students can directly call their teachers by their first names, and children can call their fathers by nicknames. Therefore, President Roosevelt's letters to his subordinates used "Dear X" to indicate that he was very formal.</p>
<p>Their personalities are full of vitality and freedom, which is different from our country in terms of content. However, this only applies to America in its youth. If you treat England, France, etc. as America, that would be terrible!</p>
<p>The Tiger of Eastern Zhejiang, Tian Xiushan  Mishan</p>
<p>A hero stumbled and became a prisoner.</p>
<p>Flipping through the Shen Bao of the 1st of this month, I saw the news of "The Bandit Tian Xiushan. Hangzhou Trial," which made me recall "Tian Huizi," who was once prominent in Shanghai. People in the Songjiang and Qingpu areas are no strangers to the name "Tian Huizi," and they also have a good impression of him. When the enemy occupied Jiangnan, Tian Huizi led thousands of brothers to launch guerrilla warfare in the Songjiang and Qingpu areas. Of course, general guerrillas inevitably "demand from the people" in the local area, but Tian Huizi's troops were different from other troops that "wandered without fighting." After all, they fought quite a few battles and established some meritorious services. They could be considered "taking from the people and using it for the people." The common people were quite afraid of "Tian Huizi's" reputation, and also quite respectful. Since he was later transferred to eastern Zhejiang, there has been no news of him for a long time, and people still occasionally mention: "I wonder how Tian Huizi is now"?</p>
<p>The news in the newspaper gave them the answer: "Tian Huizi" became a robber and has been arrested by the authorities. The "anti-Japanese hero" in the minds of the people of Songjiang and Qingpu has now become the "heinous" "Tiger of Eastern Zhejiang"! And 5,000 people in eastern Zhejiang knelt down and begged the authorities to execute Tian Xiushan!</p>
<p>In fact, based on the merits he established during the War of Resistance, he would not have to worry about his future after the victory. However, he did not do a good job and actually led his brothers to rob and rape. Today, he is reaping the consequences!</p>
<p>Odds and Ends  W.W.</p>
<p>Many people have this question: who is raising prices?</p>
<p>Many people have this dream: kill all the petty crooks!</p>
<p>However, time flies, and it's been more than a year, the question is still a "?", the dream is still a "dream"!</p>
<p>"Ten-yuan notes" and "five-yuan notes" cried to each other; after a while, they said: "We are old, useless."</p>
<p>Hundred-yuan and thousand-yuan notes are not like before, and they also sighed: "Born in sorrow, died in -- still in sorrow! Like gold, only Citi gauze is rising step by step..."</p>
<p>They were all dejected, with a thin face, and the "rumor" of US dollars came, how many notes "fell"!</p>
<p>It's almost the fifteenth of the month again, but I don't see any silver ingots calling.</p>
<p>They want to awaken the masses to worship Buddha together, but Buddhism is boundless, why need mere paper objects? Paper drunk with gold, only seen in the human world; what crime should be committed for bribing Buddha? Only when someone buys in can someone sell out, but this is a meaningless act, wasting idle funds, harming oneself and others, it can be stopped!</p>
<p>Overseas Tidbits, Inside the White House  Yu Qiang</p>
<p>The White House is not just an office building, it is a symbol of American unity.</p>
<p>In 1792, the White House was completed based on the draft by James Hoban. President Washington left office too early, and the first person to spend his presidential life in the White House was the second president of the United States, John Adams.</p>
<p>Now, open the doors of the White House and tell you about some of the rooms with special historical significance.</p>
<p>The Monroe Room</p>
<p>The Monroe Room is a monument to another era. When Mrs. Herbert Hoover was the First Lady, she moved the original furniture to the Monroe Museum in Fredericksburg, Virginia, and replicated the beautiful set that is now on display. Here, President McKinley signed a joyful national peace treaty, ending the brutal Spanish-American War.</p>
<p>In the daily life of the President of the United States, the Monroe Room has long served as a clear boundary between the trivial household chores on the second floor and the busy state affairs on the lower floor. Today, it is President Truman's living room, but it is eternally dedicated to James Monroe.</p>
<p>The Green Room</p>
<p>On May 17, 1910, the US Congress passed a bill establishing the National Commission of Fine Arts to review all changes to the White House. Before that, the character of this informal reception room changed at any time with the interests of each owner.</p>
<p>President Jefferson dined here, enjoying delicacies and chatting with close friends. During the reign of James Monroe, gold nuggets clinked and banknotes rustled on the indoor card tables. Later, the scholarly John Quincy Adams "entered the palace," and the Green Room became a quiet reception room, with white embossed curtains, a mahogany desk, and a beautiful Brussels carpet. When President Cleveland took office, the Green Room was not quiet again, and it became a music room.</p>
<p>The Blue Room</p>
<p>It is generally believed that the Blue Room is the most beautiful room in the White House. In the 1880s, when the United States was prospering and changing, that unstable situation was reflected in the history of the Blue Room. Initially, it was called the oval drawing room, and soon became the oval reception room, the circular room, and the blue oval salon. Today it is the official reception room of the country.</p>
<p>The Blue Room has a romantic history: Cleveland, the only president to be married in the White House, read his marriage vows to Frances Folsom in this flower-filled room. In the same room, the democratic President Jefferson could not stand the etiquette of bowing to guests, so he broke the tradition of Washington and Adams and went forward to shake hands with them, regardless of whether they were politicians or commoners.</p>
<p>The East Room</p>
<p>For more than a century, American presidents have held their most important social gatherings in the magnificent East Room. In 1800, the East Room was still an unfinished new house, and Mrs. John Adams, the President's wife, used to dry clothes here.</p>
<p>When the large mirrors in the East Room were covered and the walls and sconces were covered with black gauze, those were two unforgettable days: sad people lined up in solemn rows to look for the last time at Lincoln's painful face and Franklin Roosevelt's weary face.</p>
<p>This year's Miss California (standing at the highest point)</p>
<p>Joke  Sha Zhou</p>
<p>A Chinese person giving a speech in Chinese said, "I have two bi fang (that is, metaphors), one bi fang is in China, one bi fang is in a foreign country." The Chinese audience all understood it as "I have two farts, one fart is in China, one fart is in a foreign country," and they all covered their noses.</p>
<p>A foreigner lived in China for more than ten years and regarded China as his second hometown. He often said to Chinese people, "Don't treat me like a foreigner, treat me like a family member," meaning treat him like a Chinese person.</p>
<p>In a certain university entrance examination, the physiology question was "The function of the kidney." A certain student could not think of the answer after much deliberation, so he answered, "The function of the kidney is great! The most obvious function is that it can be used to stir-fry kidney flowers." It turned out that this student usually loved to eat stir-fried kidney flowers, but he knew nothing about the real function.</p>
<p>Humor  Wang Wu</p>
<p>"Punish corruption!" "Investigate him!" Everyone is saying.</p>
<p>Yes, everyone is saying it, and the corrupt officials themselves are also saying it, and they are passionate and full of fallacies, which are as clear as the sun and moon!</p>
<p>"Beware of pickpockets!" "Catch the pickpocket!" Everyone is shouting.</p>
<p>Yes, everyone is shouting, and the pickpockets themselves are also shouting, and they are indignant and full of injustice, which is witnessed by gods and men!</p>
<p>This is: I first realized what humor is.</p>
<p>News Figure, Jiang Tingfu, who recently resigned  Fan Fu</p>
<p>(Editor's note: Jiang Tingfu, who recently resigned, has already been introduced in this newspaper. This article writes from another angle. Let me say it again, it seems repetitive but it is not.)</p>
<p>Mr. Jiang Tingfu, Director-General of the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, recently resigned. Mr. Jiang, who came from a scholar specializing in history, entered the political arena eleven years ago. Recalling that in 1935, when he first left his position as the head of the Department of History at Tsinghua University to join the government, he publicly stated: "This time, Tingfu is devoted to politics, only to work hard and not to be an official, and to handle government affairs in the spirit of science. My hope for politics is: internally, I hope that all construction can benefit the people; externally, I hope to promote friendly relations between countries under the conditions of preserving national independence and sovereignty."</p>
<p>The above statement shows that Mr. Jiang is indeed good at rhetoric.</p>
<p>History Professor</p>
<p>Mr. Jiang is a native of Baoqing, Hunan, born in the late Qing Dynasty in the twenty-first year of the Guangxu reign. He studied in a private school in his hometown in his early years. At the age of eleven, he entered Mingde Elementary School in Changsha. According to Mr. Jiang himself, during his studies at the school, he was most impressed by the speaking style and eloquence of the principal, Mr. Hu Zijing. Soon, he was admitted to Yizhi School in Xiangtan, which was run by American missionaries. When the Xinhai Revolution broke out, the school was closed. Mr. Jiang was too young to join the revolutionary movement, but he was unwilling to give up his studies, so he decided to study abroad. In 1912, he went to the United States and entered a middle school as a work-study student. After graduating, he entered Oberlin College in Ohio and graduated in 1918. After graduating, he traveled to France for a year, returned to the United States, and entered the Graduate School of History at Columbia University, where he received a doctorate. After returning to China, he successively served as a history professor at Nankai University and Tsinghua University.</p>
<p>From 1935, he entered the government service and served as the ambassador to the Soviet Union, and inspected the provinces of Hunan, Jiangxi, Guangdong, etc. Before this resignation, he served as the Director-General of the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration.</p>
<p>Hard Studies</p>
<p>Mr. Jiang is a serious scholar, and there are no interesting anecdotes that can be used for entertainment. On the contrary, he had a moving experience of hard study during his studies in the United States: when he was studying at Oberlin College, the Hunan Provincial Government's funding for studying abroad was cut off halfway, so Mr. Jiang had to live in the same house with other Chinese students who had government funding. Those who had money paid for it, and Mr. Jiang had no money, so he had to contribute his labor and was responsible for cooking and cleaning. He really endured several years of hardship.</p>
<p>Mr. Jiang has now resigned. The Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration under his leadership has often been attacked by all walks of life and has been called the "Relief Headquarters," trapped in a situation of being besieged on all sides. Perhaps due to environmental and transportation factors, the mission of the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration has not been as successful as desired. However, we hope that Mr. Jiang will not be afraid of difficulties and will do as much as he can with his ability. In the past, Mr. Jiang once said: his political hope internally is that all construction can give the people real benefits. At the very least, the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration should do this.</p>
<p>History is long, and Mr. Jiang is a history expert. He must know how to leave a little brilliance of his personal life in eternal history. We look forward to it!</p>
<h3>The Hidden Pain of the Gauze Industry: Insufficient and Unsuitable Yarn Allocation; High Cotton Cloth Costs, Making Affordable Prices Difficult, as the Main Reasons for the Persistence of the Black Market</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Recently, the market price of cotton cloth has shown a slight stabilization, but the foundation remains firm. Moreover, it is heard that prices in Tianjin are rising again, which will stimulate another round of price increases. The Cotton Cloth Trade Association, due to the mayor's great attention to price stabilization, is actively seeking adjustments. It is reported that the association's pricing committee includes Dong Jiufeng, Pan Shihao, Gao Aizhou, Wu Zairong, Wu Yangsun, Wang Shenfu, Ding Fang, Ding Dafu, Wang Cai, Zhou Rongsheng, Yu Huilong, Yao Yu'en, Hao, Sun Zhaoming, and Bainian, among others. They will divide into groups for tasks, investigations, and price negotiations. Yesterday, the association held its autumn sacrifice at the South Public Office, attended by over three hundred people. Responsible members of the council requested veteran members of the industry to uphold justice and work together, which was agreed upon. However, given the rising costs, merely using price restrictions as a measure to suppress prices is not only putting the cart before the horse and futile, but also an act of self-deception that may further fuel the rampant black market. Many members of the industry also recounted the losses suffered from being forced to purchase gauze by the enemy and puppet regimes, expressing deep regret over the government's failure to allocate supplies. They pointed out that most cotton cloth merchants currently lack both capital and inventory. The government suspects that some people are hoarding cotton cloth, but those with such capability are not legitimate cotton cloth merchants. According to a certain authority, pure weaving factories are also making meager profits. If yarn factories believe that the current black market price of yarn cannot be reduced, then cloth prices will be difficult to suppress.</p>

<p>Furthermore, it was pointed out that the current selling price of medium-grade twelve-pound fine cloth is around eighty thousand yuan. Its cost, based on twenty-count yarn at 2.1 million yuan, is 63,000 yuan for the yarn, and 15,000 yuan for labor, food, starch, factory taxes, etc., totaling 78,000 yuan. If depreciation and interest are added, it barely covers the cost. It was also stated that the joint sales of cotton yarn have recently been nominal. How much yarn is actually allocated to cloth factories at the official price of 1.55 million yuan has drawn widespread attention. Although the yarn allocation can be clearly made at the official price, the quantity is limited, like a drop in the bucket. Weaving factories can only use it to slightly lower the cost of yarn. It was also stated that the Dyeing and Weaving Trade Association's member factories have over 18,000 looms. However, the yarn allocation company only allocates a few hundred bales of yarn every other day and must rotate this allocation with various cotton product reproduction industries. The raw materials needed are insufficient, which is why there is no concern about a lack of outlets for black market yarn.</p>
<p>The Amount of Yarn Used for Dyeing and Weaving</p>
<p>It was also stated that with 10,000 looms in operation, more than 300,000 bolts of cloth can be produced each month, requiring about 80,000 bales of yarn. Some factories, because they are allocated yarn every other day, randomly register multiple brands. However, weaving factories can effectively be allocated only one or two brands. When applying, they fear losing the allocation, so they apply for one or two bales of each brand. But the yarn they receive, due to the count and twist, cannot meet their immediate needs. Thus, they have to take it to the black market to exchange for other types of cotton yarn. Factories with thin capital, if they need two types of cotton yarn to weave a certain batch of cloth, but only receive one type, may even sell it and buy other yarn to meet their needs. This has been frequently observed in the cotton yarn market. The yarn allocation company is closely monitoring this matter.</p>
<p>The Reason for Resale</p>
<p>The company is closely monitoring this matter. Currently, the responsible members of the Dyeing and Weaving Trade Association have clarified the situation with the responsible members of the yarn allocation company. The yarn allocation authorities also clearly know that although cloth factories occasionally sell allocated yarn, they simultaneously buy black market yarn. They believe that the outlet for black market yarn is ultimately practical factories. However, they believe that such buying and selling violates the principle of allocation and urge rectification. The other day, a dispute arose in the yarn trade association market due to the Xin Guang Underwear Factory selling yarn allocated by the yarn allocation company. In fact, Xin Guang uses a lot of yarn every day. In addition to the small amount of allocation from the yarn allocation company, they also have to search and purchase from the market and do not regard reselling yarn allocation as a means of making money.</p>
<p>The Pain of Yarn Trading Firms</p>
<p>The supply of cotton yarn is controlled by the yarn commission, and the activity of the black market remains the most discussed topic within the Hehe Guli Yarn Trading Firms Association. According to those familiar with the details, yarn trading firms are also one of the industries weakened by being forced to purchase gauze by the enemy and puppet regimes. The yarn allocation company does not allocate to this industry, so people in the industry inevitably feel that the allocation is unfair. Since private yarn factories joined the allocation, yarn trading firms, due to their historical ties, have fortunately not been abandoned. Therefore, the place where their goods circulate is still the market. Moreover, those in the cotton product reproduction industry who are searching for yarn, because private yarn factories are even more difficult to obtain yarn from, have turned to concentrate here. Thus, there is an appearance of prosperity on the surface, but the situation is no longer what it used to be.</p>
<h3>Xu Letian, Chairman of the Fuel Management Committee, Discusses the Shanghai Coal Allocation Situation: 86% Supplied to Public Utilities; South American and Annamese White Coal Expected to Arrive in Shanghai This Winter</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Xu Letian, Chairman of the Shanghai Region Fuel Management Committee of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, recently met with our newspaper's reporter and provided detailed answers to questions raised by the reporter regarding the committee's recent situation. The details are as follows. He stated: At the beginning of the government's recovery, all major mining areas in the country were destroyed by the Communist army, and there was very little coal stored throughout the country. The total production is less than 30% of the main usage. At the same time, transportation is extremely difficult. If the government had not centralized management and supported production, the public utilities, railways, ships, and various industries in the southeastern provinces would have completely stopped long ago. If the mines had no government authorities and sound organizations such as this committee to assist them with all their strength, they would have stopped production long ago due to lack of materials and economic exhaustion.</p>
<p>Sixteen Ships Transporting Coal</p>
<p>Currently, the committee leases a total of sixteen ships for transporting coal. Branch offices are set up in Qingdao, Hankou, Guangzhou, and other places. The main source of coal transportation is the coal mines in Qinhuangdao in the north. They can transport 130,000 to 140,000 tons per month. In the south, it is the Keelung coal mine in Taiwan, which can transport 40,000 to 50,000 tons per month. Coal mines in Huainan and East China can also transport a small amount of coal. Under the extremely unfavorable conditions of transportation and commerce, the committee's transportation capacity can still reach over 100,000 tons per month. The supply area, in addition to Pingjin, is almost entirely allocated by the committee. In terms of production, we are doing our best to support the mines in increasing production. We are using the mine timber obtained from barter trade with Japan to mine as much coal as possible. The current Kailuan Coal Mine's daily coal production has increased from 5,000 tons to 12,000 tons. The daily coal production in Keelung, Taiwan, has also increased from 500 tons to 3,000 tons.</p>
<p>Northeast Coal May Come Next Spring</p>
<p>What is currently hoped for is that the two major coal mines in the Northeast, Fushun and Xinqiu, can also be restored to coal production soon. However, limited by the supply of water and electricity, the initial recovery will likely only produce about 7,000 tons of coal per day. However, winter is approaching rapidly, and the Northeast itself also needs coal urgently. It is expected that only next spring can the surplus be supplied to the southeastern provinces. It is estimated that roughly 60,000 to 100,000 tons can be supplied per month. When the Northeast region resumes mass production and the political situation improves, the national coal shortage problem can be easily solved.</p>
<p>The Allocation Price Has Remained Unchanged</p>
<p>Currently, 86% of the coal allocated by the committee must be supplied to public utilities, railways, ships, etc. in the southeastern provinces. The prices of the remaining 14% of the coal supplied have remained unchanged. For example, the coal supplied to the Shanghai Electric Power Company is still over 30,000 yuan per ton. The coal supplied to the Two Railway Bureaus and power plants in the southeastern provinces is still 50,000 yuan per ton. The committee has to bear a purchase cost of 20,000 yuan. Although there was a slight surplus in the past due to the different supply prices of the 14% of industrial coal, it is currently impossible to make up for the loss. In Shanghai, in terms of the bituminous coal that the committee can supply and the white coal dust used by citizens for cooking, since March of this year, after the committee used effective measures to suppress the price, it has been unable to rise again.</p>
<p>Reasons for the Recent Increase in the Price of White Coal</p>
<p>The reason for the high price of white coal blocks used for home heating on the black market is that the Zhengtai Railway was cut off, and Shanxi coal could not be transported out (it has recently been restored to traffic, but due to insufficient vehicles, only a small amount has been transported out). The Mentougou Coal Mine was flooded. There was a panic in North China for coal used for home heating. Therefore, the authorities in North China prohibited the export of white coal, which caused a shortage of white coal in Shanghai. However, China is currently conducting barter trade negotiations with Annam, exchanging our raw silk for Annam's Hong Gai white coal. Currently, Mr. Guemo, the French economic representative, has negotiated with me several times, and it is generally expected to be successful. Furthermore, South American coal is also expected to arrive in Shanghai before this winter, so that there will be no panic in the city for coal used for winter heating.</p>
<p>Unified Planning and Allocation: Emergency Measures</p>
<p>In August of this year, the committee revised the "Five Points for the Provisional Management of Domestic and Foreign Imported Coal," because domestic areas are unstable, and coal producing areas and transportation routes are often damaged. Therefore, these emergency measures had to be taken. The purpose is nothing more than to make unified and reasonable allocation and supply of coal throughout the country. The five measures are:</p>
<p>(1) This committee shall manage the bituminous coal and white coal imported into the Shanghai area from domestic and foreign sources, and the coke imported from domestic sources, in accordance with these measures.</p>
<p>(2) Bituminous coal imported from domestic sources shall be managed uniformly by this committee. If anyone transports it without the approval of this committee, this committee shall purchase all of it at the purchase price of this committee.</p>
<p>(3) Merchants are allowed to freely transport and sell domestic white coal and coke. However, they must apply to the competent authority at the port of export for a transport permit, and report to this committee for inspection upon import. This committee may purchase it at cost plus a profit of 5% if necessary.</p>
<p>(4) The import of bituminous coal and white coal from foreign sources must be approved by this committee. If anyone freely transports and imports it without approval, this committee shall purchase all of it at the purchase price of this committee.</p>
<p>(5) For those who have been approved to import bituminous coal and white coal from foreign sources, this committee may, if necessary, purchase all of it at the approved cost plus a profit. He stated: The large tonnage of coal transportation and the required capital are definitely beyond the reach of ordinary merchants. Moreover, merchants who transport coal will ultimately prioritize profit and sell too much to the black market, and they will definitely not sacrifice the supply of public utilities and coke professionals when necessary. Therefore, it is necessary to implement this unified planning method to make a comprehensive and reasonable allocation before the policy of coal supply is restored. As for the repurchase of inferior products, the principle is that all of them are repurchased. Moreover, the prices of the repurchases are all the same. There is no division into shares or repurchase at equal silk prices.</p>
<h3>Commercial Banks Offer Long-Term Low-Interest Loans: Two Conditions Required</h3>
<p>(1) Real estate can be used as collateral.</p>
<p>(2) Re-discounting and re-mortgaging are permitted.</p>
<p>Under the current oppression of high-interest loans, the capital turnover of commerce, industry, and agriculture is not smooth, and production cannot be maintained. At this time, Consultant Putin of the Senate made a suggestion to the government to adjust the funds of industry, agriculture, and commerce. The government authorities are considering it. Xu Guozhen, general manager of Jin Cheng Bank, said: To adjust the funds of industry, agriculture, and commerce, long-term low-interest loans must be offered, but this is currently difficult for all commercial banks to do, because the amount of reserves of the first bank is too large, which affects the amount of loans. At present, among the commercial banks in Shanghai, there are not many with deposits of 10 billion. A bank with 10 billion yuan must pay various reserves of about 6 billion, and interest to depositors of 1 billion. The actual amount that can be loaned is only 3 billion yuan. Calculated at a monthly interest rate of 15%, the interest income is only 450 million yuan, while the monthly expenses of such banks are more than 500 million yuan. Under this situation of insufficient income to cover expenses, how can interest rates be lowered? Secondly, because most of the current depositors are demand deposit accounts, which require preparation for payment at any time, banks cannot offer long-term loans. At most, they can only offer loans for one month, usually for one week or even less. Under this situation, borrowers can only use the loans for speculative business except for temporary relief. If you want commercial banks to offer long-term low-interest loans, the first is to allow banks to use real estate as reserves, because the purpose of setting up reserves is to prevent the bank from going bankrupt and to use this money to compensate depositors for their losses. If so, it may not be necessary to use cash as collateral, but to use the bank's real estate as collateral, which will increase the bank's circulating funds. Second, state banks should offer re-discounting and re-mortgaging, so that commercial banks have state banks as a backing when they do not have enough funds. If so, commercial banks will have sufficient circulating funds and can offer long-term low-interest loans. Otherwise, only a few state banks will offer such loans, which will still not meet the needs of the industry, commerce, and agriculture sectors. Commercial banks must assist state banks to be effective.</p>
<h3>Four Batches of Raw Silk Warehouse Receipts Handled by the China Trust Bureau</h3>
<p>Regarding the purchase of the fourth batch of spring rain raw silk, the factories had previously completed the warehouse receipts, the receipts, and the transfer procedures, and handed them over to the China Company for sorting. It is learned that this morning, it can be handed over to the Central Trust Bureau, which will send personnel to the warehouses to inspect them according to the receipts before making payments. According to this total, it is estimated to be 1,950 dan, and the fifth batch of raw silk, about 400 dan, can also be sent to the China Trust Bureau for processing within days. It is also learned that the previous purchase time was slightly cumbersome, because the warehouse transfer procedures were slightly more complicated. Now, efforts have been made to simplify the procedures and change to direct custody by the China Trust Bureau for transfer registration to save time.</p>
<h3>Trading of US Dollars Resumes Today; Authorities are Closely Monitoring</h3>
<p>Last Thursday, the US dollar market conditions were greatly affected by rumors, and prices fluctuated sharply, causing great confusion in the market and stimulating various prices to jump up. The Municipal Government and important banks specially formulated three temporary measures for buying and selling US dollars, which were implemented immediately to draw up effective countermeasures to completely eliminate the black market speculation of US dollars. At the same time, the Money Exchange Trade Association also resolved on that day to suspend US dollar transactions for three days. The deadline for this suspension has recently expired. It is learned that the Money Exchange industry has received instructions from President Bei to resume US dollar trading today, but must comply with the following three regulations, namely, the purchase and sale price must not exceed the exchange rate for US telegraphic transfers announced by the Central Bank plus 5%. If anyone raises the purchase price, it must be reported to the municipal government immediately. If any money exchange shop manipulates prices, it will be severely punished. Song Ziwen, President of the Executive Yuan, personally borrowed Minister Yu of the Ministry of Finance to come to Shanghai at the end of last week to discuss appropriate measures. After arriving at his residence that day, Song summoned President Bei of the Central Bank to inquire about the financial situation of the city and listen to the report.</p>
<h3>Recent Brokerage Prices for American Cotton</h3>
<p>[Reuters, New York, 5th] The opening prices on the New York Cotton Exchange are 145,000 yuan for brokerage purchases and 90,000 yuan for brokerage sales. Note that the purchase price on September 18 was 120,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Longan Rebounds</h3>
<p>Recently, the sales of dried longan have gradually become more active, and sales on this street have also been smooth. Therefore, the market situation has rebounded, and the quoted price has increased by about 20,000, and the market price has followed. The current market price is a top of 300,000 yuan, and Quanzhou Longan Shen Da is 320,000 yuan.</p>
