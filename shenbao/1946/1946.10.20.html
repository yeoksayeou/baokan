<p>前排自右至左：李璜，華岡，沈鈞儒，郭沫若，周恩來，黃炎培：。後排自右自左：左舜生，李維漢，吳鐵城，羅隆基，邵力子，蔣勻田，東啓天，陳家康，胡政之，（本報攝）</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕政府代表吳鐵城邵力子雷震三氏，日前專機來滬，邀請中共及第三方面諸代表晋京，賡續中斷已達數月之會談，經二日來不斷之奔走，使命已吿圓滿完成。中共及第三方面各領袖，已於昨日歡聲雷動中決定於明晨乘政府專機飛京，政府三代表除雷氏已因公先行返京外，吳邵二氏，亦已於昨夜返京。</p>
<p>昨日空氣更見和諧，雖會談時尙未正式涉及具體問題，然與會各代表皆極抱樂觀，渠等深感全國同胞所衷心朝夕渴望之停戰，由於日來之談商，又已更逼近一步。</p>
<p>昨晨各代表未有集議，僅單獨交換意見；正午靑年黨邀宴全體代表；下午四時，民主社會黨在愚園路該黨總部舉行茶會，下午七時，中共在思南路周公館邀宴各代表；正式交換意見，係在下午五時至七時，在海格路望應舉行。</p>
<p>各代表情緒皆極愉快，觥籌交錯之際，充滿祥和空氣。參加會談者，有吳鐵城·邵力子。周恩來·李維漢·陳家康·張君勱·徐傅霖·曾琦·胡政之·李璜·陳啓天·左舜生·楊永浚·余家菊·郭沫若·羅隆基·沈鈞儒·黃炎培·章伯鈞·蔣勻田等。</p>
<p>在民主社會黨茶會中，張君勱氏首請該黨發起人之一開國元勳徐傅霖氏致詞。徐氏稱：彼希望政府放大眼光，爲整個國家，整個民族而讓步；並望巾共方面，亦爲整個國家，全體同胞而讓步。第三方面願盡力促成和談之成功，俾新中國得以締造。</p>
<p>吳鐵城氏繼致詞稱：政府要求和平統一，與在野各黨派同其迫切、故政府懇切敦請各黨派及社會賢達各政協代表早日赴京，恢復和平商談，務期商談成功，和平實現。且望各在野賢達皆成爲「在朝」，共同負責，不但解決國家一切問題，且共謀國家之建設。余與邵力子先生代表政府政協代表，特來邀請諸位先生入京，便聆諸位先生高見，並請諸位先生指教。余等懇切希望諸君至京。今日余等在滬任務，當可吿一段落，如諸位不能於今明同往南京，亦望早日成行，余等當企待諸君之來，共商國是，此不特爲政府之希望，亦全國民衆之希望也。</p>
<h3 id="c2">商談門戶已開　深望獲致和平　周恩來在茶會致詞 <a href="#c2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>周恩來氏繼即應邀致詞，略稱：適承徐先生指示，不特興奮，且更欣慰。我人聚首一堂，實不容易、當年政協開幕後，全國歡欣鼓舞，祝其成功，而政協卒吿成功。不幸其後又生波折，政協未能重開，遂致各黨各派及社會賢達各方人士到京後，不得不又索然離去。今和談停頓已達五月，現承第三方面諸先生之努力，政府代表亦已抵滬，終得重新聚首晤談，非正式之商談現已開始，商談之門戶已開，深望能達到和平，民主，獨立，統一。凡比種種已在政協規定，今惟求其實現，而尤以和平即停戰爲最要。此爲全國民衆所迫切要求，願遵徐先生之囑，求能達到目的。</p>
<h3 id="c3">曾琦希望停止烽火 <a href="#c3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>次由曾琦致詞稱：今日實重慶政協閉幕後首次盛大集會，不勝令人欣喜。今日之會，即爲全國團結之象徵，足見前途之光明可期。現在之爭執，在于烽火之未息。第三方面係無槍之政黨，今日政府及中共，已漸重第三方面之意見。蓋「不重其人，不重其言」，故必須「重其人，重其黨」，始能「重其言」。第三方面乃覺一則以喜，一則以懼：喜者在意見有被採納之餘地，可化干戈爲玉帛，懼者惟恐能力薄弱，不能成功。余信雙方能誠心誠意尊重第三方面，則第三方面必能保持不偏不倚之精神，以其眞正第三者之立塲努力。然中庸云，「白刃可蹈也，中庸不可爲也」，第三者或仍不免有挨罵之可能。此爲余今日之感想。余與君勱先生相識，早在民國八年，迄今垂三十年，以後務期共盡最大努力，停止烽火，促成和平。</p>
<h3 id="c4">張君勵發言自稱小兄弟 <a href="#c4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>其後張君勱氏並邀請羅隆基及沈鈞儒二氏致詞，皆以「民盟與民主社會黨是一家人」謙辭。張氏遂致詞云：「今日承國共及其他黨派，社會賢達，惠然肯來，共聚一堂，實爲榮幸。民主社會黨在各政黨中爲「小兄弟」，尙不足局歲，至今日乃似已長成。民國十三年以後，中國歷史實即國共兩黨之歷史。而十三年後至日本投降止，可稱爲中國史上最黑暗之時期，今日之歡聚，實爲土三年後所難得。「小兄弟」願追隨各位「老大哥」之後，於達到民主，統一，建國，希能有所實獻。詞畢，掌聲大作。吳鐵城氏趨前舉杯，稱來賓應向民主社會黨諸公祝賀！衆皆欣然舉杯。吳氏旋笑稱：民主社會黨雖出生不到一年。而先天極足！合座歡然。</p>
<h3 id="c5">返京商談如獲協議　即可發出停戰令 <a href="#c5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>〔本報南京十九日電〕時局之演變迄至今晚已獲重大好轉，且因政府之容讓，使雙方意見趨於接近，共黨代表周恩來曁其他各黨派等，均可於廿一日由政府派專機迎返南京，重開商談，停戰問題，可即在軍事三人小組會中討論而獲得解決，因雙方均誠懇同意停戰，故停戰令亦可即頒發。此項消息係記者今晚八時許自政協代表孫科氏談話中得之，孫氏以極樂觀之態度吿記者，局勢實已大轉變，一切問題當俟彼等蒞京商談，共產黨已同意政府所提意見，允即返京，亦即不堅持延安方面兩項意見之表示，彼等於廿一日返京，如當日開會，當日可獲致協議，當可即發停戰令，「三」「五」兩會亦可召開，憲草審議會亦將舉行，至國大代表問題，共黨代表名額問題，則須在綜合小組內決定之。</p>
<p>吳鐵城周恩來兩氏握手（本報攝）</p>
<h3 id="c6">吳邵二代表昨晚先晉京 <a href="#c6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>記者更因士凶未卜，不勝焦慮。六時半，忽聞熱烈之掌聲，繼以歡笑，始稍釋然。七時正，各記者被邀入集議之室，羅隆基氏代表全體，發表談話稱：非正式談判，今日又舉行一次，較昨日更見和諧，和談已又進一步。現已決定在京先繼續非正式之談判，政府代表定今晚晋京，第三方面及中共全體代表，定後日（二十一日）早晨乘政府專機晋京，繼續昨今二日之非正式談判。</p>
<p>邵力子氏稱，目前之會談已爲「談，停，談」中之第一部份的「談」。羅　基氏補充稱：二十一日晋京諸人，包括前昨二日參加會談之全體各黨各派及社會賢達人士，不限於政協代表。</p>
<h3 id="c7">中共之宴笑聲洋溢 <a href="#c7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>陳家康氏於答記者詢問時，並曾透露：政府所要求者爲維持現狀，中共所要求者則爲尊重協定。各代表旋皆往思南路周公館應中共之宴，賓主盡歡，笑聲洋溢。吳邵二氏離滬後，記者並於深夜訪問第三方面若干代表，徵詢對和談前途之意見，各代表均一致表示樂觀，咸以爲雙方意見縱有距離，而戰事已有勢在不能不停之勢，因停戰已不但爲全中國人民之共同要求，亦且爲全世界人士所渴望者矣。</p>
<h3 id="c8">雷震返抵京　謁主席報告 <a href="#c8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>〔本報南京十九日電〕政協秘書長雷震，十八日夜車返京，十九日晨七時一刻抵達，九時半即在孫科院長私邸之會談中出席報吿，與會者計有張厲生，王世杰，陳布雷，陳立夫，吳鼎昌，孫科，雷震七人，雷氏報吿在滬兩日接觸經過，尤對主席文吿中「一俟共黨予以同意」及「在共黨同意以上各點後」內「同意」二字加以闡釋，孫稱，同意與諒解實係一事，意義相同，如共黨能諒解此種意見，則即可開始商談。雷報吿甚詳，達一小時之久，旋各代表發表意見，均希望各黨派代表能即日返京，並依照主席提示解決時局問題八項方針，分別召開三人小組及非正式五人小組會議，則停戰令自可頒發，會後陳布雷，雷震兩氏，於中午往謁主席報吿一切，下午雷再以此意以長途電話吿知上海，據聞滬方今日四時之集會即根據此種意見予以討論，結果則爲雙方獲得諒解，聞已定星期一返京，政協政府代表吳鐵城，邵力子兩氏，則定十九日夜車返京，二十日晨當可抵達。又民盟梁漱溟曾於七時訪雷震談一小時。</p>

<h3 id="c10">東北華北將星雲集　平舉行軍事會議　陳總長臨時中止赴張垣 <a href="#c10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>〔本報北平十九日電〕聯合後勤總部總司令黃鎮球，偕黃何二副總司令，亦於十九日抵平，陳誠，顧祝同，熊式輝，杜聿明，傅作義，王輝武，李宗仁，孫連仲，王叔銘等，十九日晨在陳氏行館開會，下午復在北平行轅開會，今夜繼績開會。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十九日電〕聯合後勤總司令黃鎮球，副司令黃維，十九日下午五時由京專機飛平，聞黃等除參加陳總長在平舉行之軍事會議外，並將飛東北，綏遠，大同各地視察。</p>
<p>〔本報北平十八日電〕（遲到）十八日將星雲集北平，東北方面之能式輝，杜聿明，趙家讓，下午二時抵平，陸軍總司令兼鄭州綏署主任顧祝同與徐州綏署第二綏靖區司令王耀武，亦先後抵平，傅作義十八日在張垣候陳總長不到，下午接陳總長電召，於六時趕到北平。陳總長原定十八日飛瀋陽，當日轉張家口，臨時中止，各將領之齊集北平，似爲十八日之臨時決定，正爲共產黨十七日發表聲明之後。</p>
<h3 id="c11">「上海會談」新聞綫外吳周含笑握手　「第四方面」大爲活躍 <a href="#c11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>昨天中央攝影塲各攝影師，在望盧計劃工作的時候，大家說總要有一張吳鐵城和周恩來握手的鏡頭，到正式開拍時，吳秘書長說：「請周先生站在當中，我和邵先生立在旁邊，立得近一點不就好了嗎」？然而立在攝影師後面的記者們，却異口同聲地發出了由衷的呼聲：「請握手！握手」！吳氏立刻含笑向周恩來氏伸出了手，周氏爽快地緊緊握住，攝影機的聲音響了，留下了這令人永遠不能忘記的一幕！</p>
<p>某代表在解釋「停談」，「談停談」，「談停」，的時候，曾笑對記者們說：「我們替各位作註解，各位本月份的薪水，也得扣一部份給我們」。連日會談的塲所，一在海格路範園（係張君勱胞妹徐志摩夫人公館），一在海格路望盧吳鐵城公館，記者羣中有的說，此次商談必能成功，因「望盧」是有希望，「範園」是有範圍。</p>
<p>在愚園路民主社會黨開茶會的時候，記者們說：「我們是第四方面」｛結果「第四方面」也有茶點招待。張君勱氏興緻特別高，他說：「我要和吳先生，邵先生合攝一張照」，又說：「我要和周先生合拍一張照」，一張一張的拍着，誰也沒有見過張先生這樣愉快。</p>
<p>邵力十氏連日辛勞，昨天會談時略覺不適，望盧中一片傳呼「買萬金油」之聲！羅隆基說，邵先生一面開會，一面打瞌睡，其實是爲了國事，高年的邵先生，實在是累了，謀國之忠，功績不在抗日將士之下吳秘書長的公館望盧，是十四年前「一二八」時各記者採訪新聞的中心，華貴古雅，布置非常精緻，當年吳氏在上海市長任內接見記者的小客廳，也就是這兩天接見記者的地方，連陳設着的照片也還是當年的樣子。十四年來滄桑萬變，這小客廳的景物仍不殊當年！</p>
<p>前天最緊張的一剎那，是下午四五點鐘，在周公館突然聽到延安聲明的時條，昨天最緊張的一剎那，還是在下午五點鐘，各代表在望盧關起大門來商談的時候，也許中國的歷史，在那時候是兩個最嚴重的轉捩關頭。昨天七點鐘，記者們進入會議室聽正式發布新聞的時候，急急先問各代表消息好不好，黃炎培說：「是好消息」。邵力乎也說，「很好的消息」。周恩來笑着通說：「你問他們，你問他們」！</p>

<p>〔本報杭州十九日電〕司徒大使於今晨由周市長王揆生等引導，前往本市天漢洲橋訪問其故居。該處爲杭市最早之耶穌教堂，由其父建於遜清同治十二年，司徒大使於一八七六年誕生於此，度其歡樂之童年，至十一歲始　國求學，學成後於一九〇四年底偕其新婚妻　返杭　，亦居於此，故司使對杭州有特別親切之感，並　　表示渠能講幾句杭州話爲極大之榮幸。司使在其誕生之房中，逗留多時，此時窗外風和日麗，秋陽可人，司使含笑頷首，似在回憶其童年之夢。室內空氣和祥，七十一年前此一中國之和平使者誕生於此，以傳教士之熱誠，願終身爲中國人民造福，於今國是正在轉變關鍵之秋，來此訪問，實有其極大之意義。司使童年所植之樹，今巳蔭蓋屋宇，而渠今所播之和平種子，將來亦必有滿意之成就。</p>
<p>司使在其故居逗留半小時後，至外賓招待所小憩，即車赴之江大學，市公務局沈局長前導，周市長等均作陪，李校長培恩熱情招待，於十一時半至該校都克堂演講，全校師生七百餘人，均往諦聽。司使進門時，全體自動起立，掌聲如雷，李校長略致歡迎詞後，司使即以柔和之中國語開始演講，略謂：渠以數十年教育之經驗，深感中國學生之偉大力量，中國學生運動，爲歷史上僅見之偉大奇蹟，中國之愛國運動，均爲中國學生力量使然，如五四運動，此種精神，使我永念不忘，過去抗日戰爭中，即表現中國學生之精神意志團結組織之力量，深望此種力量，繼續發揮，以促使實現和平統一強大之中國，能有思想，言論，宗教，信仰，討論國是的自由，務使民國有名有實。現在雖多貪官污吏，然應歸咎於民，不應歸咎於政府，此爲民國改革之道。民國成立以來，年年破壞，此後應重建設，故此革命亦應爲建設之革命，而非破壞之革命。最後，渠望中國青年均有宗教信仰，蓋可增進其愛國與服務社會服務人民之熱情云。</p>

<p>〔中央社長春十九日電〕舉世知名擁有無盡森林煤礦之東北，今冬感受嚴重之煤荒，時屆深秋，落葉蕭蕭，而全市渴望之禦寒恩物煤炭，仍空無所有，黑市煤價，雖每噸已高至流通券萬四五千元，然此並不足誘致煤商之大量運入，蓋在交通工具缺乏，及煤產市受嚴格控制之情形下，彼等實無能爲力也。此間之日僑，陸續遣送後，新市區內，滿綴花草之日式住宅，幾已全部空出，此等精緻而織巧之建築物，雖均有人接收或登記領用，然真正遷入居住者，則寥落可數，考其原因，乃爲煤斤缺乏，無以取暖，市內各機關員工眷屬，爲節省燃煤計，紛謀聚居一處，而若干不同隸屬之機關，亦相約合署辦公，以便共渡嚴冬，最近東北行轅經委會，募資修繕之海上大樓，即將成爲與經濟部門有關機關之公共避寒所。該建築物規模宏大，駕前此東北行營所駐之滿炭大樓而上之，刻已約定，與東北統一接收委員會長春分會，糧食管理局，經濟部辦事處及房地產局等機關合住，此外該樓尚有可容三四百人辦公之空餘房間，召請借用，借用之機關，並不須繳付租金，僅須共同分擔今冬之煤費及公共使用之水電等費即可。此對在京滬各地以金條頂住房屋之人士，實爲一大諷刺。</p>

<p>美國爲了恢復戰後國際貿易的自由，便由國務院發表了一種白皮書，提出發展國際貿易與提高各國就業水準的一項計劃，並建議各國舉行國際貿易與就業會議，俾在會議中通過「世界貿易憲章」，而組織「國際貿易機構」。聯合國社會經濟理事會乃邀請中美英法等十九國代表，自本月十五日起，在倫敦舉行預備會議，擬就國際貿易會議的程序及其議事日程。除了蘇聯一國而外，世界各列強均有代表參加。戰後世界貿易的動向，和着這個預備會議的成功。實在有着非常密切的關係，值得我們的注意。</p>
<p>這次預備會議的性質，與過去召開的布萊登森林國際貨幣基金會議，大體相同，是以討論美國所提出的計劃爲中心。至於美國計劃的內容如何？我們還沒有看到國務院所發表的白皮書，殆難加以揣測；但據法國新聞社倫敦十七日來電，美國代表魏爾柯克斯曾在預備會議中，對於復興世界經濟，提出五項原則：（一）大量減低關稅壁壘；（二）各國互相交換貨物；（三）對於各種進口貨，不應予以歧視；（四）各國應保持高度的就業率；（五）各國在國際市場中，一律平等。</p>
<p>在參加這次預備會議的十八國代表，對於美國的建議，多少都表示贊成，尤其是中國，據我國代表金問泗在會中發言稱：「中國政府對於本會所負之任務，甚爲重視；吾人必須確保戰後世界能享勝利之果，不再遭受貧困之痛苦；中國政府對於美國之發起，召開世界貿易及就業會議，深表贊同；故中國代表團準備接受美國所提出之憲章，作爲討論的基礎；但仍盼望各國代表能提出積極性及具體建議，俾使比較不發達之國家，亦能早日完成其工業化之任務。」其他各國代表，亦無不表示贊同；使這次會議充滿了愉快與祥和的空氣，大家都覺得前途光明，大可樂觀。</p>
<p>但是我們研究一下美國提出此項計劃所懷有的願望，再觀察目前世界的實際情形，深覺恢復戰後國際貿易的自由，還有若干困難，尚待美國政治外交家的努力。美國計劃的重點，乃在組織聯合國國際貿易機構，實行經濟合作，一方面以互惠互利爲原則，使各國均有自由發展其貿易及經濟之機會；另一方面則依照平等條件，各國均有取得市場及原料的均等機會。一言以蔽之，乃在實現美國的願望，也就是恢復國際貿易的自由，而使各國逐漸解除對於貿易的限制。但是這一個願望，能否實現？至少在今日，還是一個極嚴重的問題。</p>
<p>第一是蘇聯集團各國的未參加此項會議，足以表示今日的世界，在經濟上已有兩大集團的存在；一面是社會主義的體系，以蘇聯爲領導的國家；另一面是資本主義的體系，以美國爲中心。這兩大集團，不論在思想上或在利害上，都好比水火的不相容。尤其是蘇聯在東歐的鐵幕重重，使別國休想問津。是以美國所倡導的國際貿易自由運動，其所能推行的範圍，充其量也不過是所謂英美集團的範圍以內而已。如果蘇聯集團不參加國際貿易的發展，則無多大意義可言。</p>
<p>第二是戰後其他各國，尤其是英法兩國，因爲在大戰期內，受了重大損失，戰後欲言復興繁榮，均非易事，故對於對外貿易，均加以種種的限制，美國雖然不惜以钜款貸與英法兩國，協助其復興經濟，但要英法解除一切限制辦法，一時也不能完全辦到。誠如法國代表亞爾芳在會中表示：「兩次世界大戰，使法國蒙受重大損失，法國尚需相當時期，始能取消其對於進口貨的限制。」</p>
<p>第三是經濟落後的國家，其產業尚未完全工業化，對於國際貿易自由，在原則上雖不能反對；但是爲了發展本國工業起見，不能不採取所謂「適度的保護」辦法。國爲經濟落後的國家，根本不能與美國站在平等的立場，美國計劃所揭　的自由·平等·互惠·互利的原則，徒然有利於美國，而對於產業落後的國家，却是不能享受其益。這一個矛盾，如果不能設法消除，則發展國際貿易的前途，也是未可樂觀的。美國在國際貿易自由的原則之下，雖可獲益匪淺，但對於經濟落後各國的工業化問題，也不能不注意及此。印度代表尼黑路，曾在會議發表意見，指摘美國計劃，並未能顧及經濟不發達國家的利益。這句話，是值得美國當局深思的。</p>
<p>第四是戰後各國的失業問題。現在各國都在相繼復員了，但是經過這次戰禍的洗劫之後，各國國內無不瘡痍滿目，欲言復興，均感困難，尤其是人民的就業問題，更不容易解決。所以如何始能保持各國高度的就業率？也是一個嚴重的問題，需要美國能夠提出具體辦法來，空言是無補實際的。</p>
<p>美國出席聯合國大會代表團團長奧斯汀，於十八日宣稱，美國願居世界領導地位，廢除戰爭，用和平方法解決國際糾紛，並提高世界各國人民在知識上精神上及物質上之生活水準，以袪除引起戰爭的原因。所以我們渴望美國對於發展國際貿易，應該放大眼光，正視現實，調和各方面的利益，共謀世界各國的復興與繁榮；切不可自私自利，到處只爲自己的利益打算，而被人視爲經濟的帝國主義。國際貿易的前途，建築在世界各國經濟的繁榮上。如果世界各國貧困，則美國決不能獨享繁榮的。</p>

<p>〔法國新聞社華盛頓十八日電〕貝爾納斯國務卿返國後，昨夜初次發表廣播演說，對於和會經過，美蘇關係及未來和平之建立，均有所論列。其言略謂：美國人民願向蘇聯及其他各國厭倦戰爭之人民，伸出友誼之手。和平之遲遲不能進展，一若武裝衝突有不可避免之勢。蘇聯統治者不能袪除此種想像，殆爲吾儕儕齬之根本原因。外間所謂美國向蘇聯進行包圍之說，全出幻想。吾人自史達林元帥本人之聲明中，即可知蘇聯並不發現其自身處於危險的包圍之中。促進美蘇間之諒解與同情，乃爲政治家於感棘手之工作。若謂一國必須完全順從另一國之全部要求，此種方式爲美國所反對。同時美國對於成立個別同盟之政策，亦將繼續反對。余以爲衝突不可避免之一項觀念，倘長此存在，則歐洲經濟決無復興之望。以巴黎和會而論，對於和平草的多數條文，均議而未決，但此不足爲憂，所可憂者，乃爲蘇蘇關係之繼續緊張及其滋長耳。</p>
<p>此際美國仍以公正與尊重他人權利爲基礎，繼續　蘇聯及其他各國人民覓致友誼，但美國本身權利之公平與尊重亦須顧及。美國務須參加合作，建立世界新秩序，其目的不在支持現狀，而在維護公正之和平與自由。完成此項任務，有出以忍耐必要。吾人必須穩紥穩打，築成和平機構，使共固如磐石云。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕舊金山十九日廣播：前商務部長華萊士頃發表談話，批評國務卿貝爾納斯今日所發表之美國外交政策演說稱：渠「益信美國必將採取現實的外交政策。」華氏續稱，「貝爾納斯已較上决發表斯都伽特演說時爲進步，希望今後　將繼續進步，深信美國務卿終必體認美國人民需要國際正義，睦鄰與和平。」云。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社華盛頓十八日電〕貝爾納斯國務卿昨夜發表之廣播演說，華盛頓政界人士完全表示滿意，認爲此乃美國外交政策之最明顯的闡釋。若　力言，貝爾納斯國務卿已表示和平之責任現繫於蘇聯，因無人再能懷疑美國之政策非眞正和平政策。同時亦須承認，蘇聯若不力謀與美國解決爭執，和平即無實現可能。下次國際會議範圍將更爲廣大，至少對於解決此項爭執，能開其端倪。四國外長會議下次開會時，目前世界緊張局勢可能將大爲緩和。事實上貝氏之言論，應視爲美國大部份人民之意見，且爲內閣所完全贊同。貝氏籲請對蘇促進友誼一點，值得重視。要而言之，國務卿此種呼籲決非徒然云。</p>

<p>〔聯合社新德里十九日電〕甘地昨夜勸吿孟加拉印　衝突區婦女服毒，或用其他方法自殺，以免受辱。此種表示係向賤民區參加晚褥之數百聽衆而發。甘地謂；受辱之危險即將來臨，婦女應利用小刀或槍枝自殺，或投水自溺，但此項演說，官方譯文並米提及此節。按甘地所謂受辱，殆指强迫改信宗敎或强姦而言。</p>

<p>〔本報東京特派員十五日電〕自國有鐵道職工工潮發生以來，共黨領導下之勞動陣營，全日本各產業勞動組合會議（各業總工會）與政府方面已陷於完全對立地位。該組合最近通令各支部發動十月攻勢，企以共同鬥爭之武器，即同盟罷工令各生產部門發生麻醉，以打倒吉田內閣。此政治罷工運動之開展，不僅對各產業給與深刻之影響，且對一般社會生活亦發生極大不安。最近政府方面對勞動運動已擬採取强硬態度，突於十三日宣布實施勞動關係調整法；而該組合方面則認爲此乃展開共同鬥爭之良機，提出：（一）絕對反對裁員，（二）實現全員僱傭，（三）確立生活費爲標準之最低工資，（四）廢除五百限度，（五）實行八小時工作制，（六）撤消勞動關係調整法，（七）確立罷工標，（八）劃定失業保險制及社會保險法，（九）反對暴力團及官廳破壞罷工，（十）廢除對婦女之差別待遇，（十一）以人民之手復興生產，（十二）反對農民惡稅，（十三）打倒吉田內閣。可見此次十月攻勢之主要目標：（一）打倒吉田内閣，（二）樹立民主人民政府。現決定參加罷工之工人有炭工，電氣，電影，演劇，郵電，機器，車輛業，醫生，敎職員，國鐵等，其中以炭工之動向最關重要。現北海道炭工已全部參加罷工，常盤炭礦已有一部參加。緣石炭乃日本產業之原動力，罷工一旦擴大，出炭勢必减少，此乃對日本經濟之莫大打擊。本月出炭計劃爲一百八十五萬噸，如炭工罷工，則十月中對各產業之分配炭量將减少一半；換言之，日本產業之原動力將因之减半。一旦各業工人同盟罷工見諸實行，則參加罷工人數將達八十萬人。惟該組合所號召之十月攻勢能否成功，現尙屬疑問，因（一）所屬各支部之面背未見一致，有若干支部是否參加，尙疑問。如生命保險港灣，盟軍，勞務木材，土木建築等各業之工人待遇，均已相當改善。（二）各組合間之意見尙未一致，如九州炭工支部及電影松竹支等。（三）勞動調整法業已實行，爲該法所拘束之產業工人，即與公益有關之產業工人，不得任意罷工，其中有電氣石炭，新聞，化學，肥料等。吉田首相曾於昨日在大阪接見新聞記者，聲明將根據勞動調整法，取締工潮，並於十一日衆議院大會中謂：政治罷工乃超越工會運動範圍之舉動。同時社會黨領導下之勞動總同盟，一反過去之靜觀態度，於十二日召開中央常務委員會，決定反對政治罷工，認此舉將使勞動組合與國民游離，而促成反動勢力之抬頭；並聲明吉田內閣如仍採取擁護資本家之產業經濟及勞動政策，則將令其倒台。此間各報輿論，對目前之勞動糾紛甚表憂慮。朝日新聞於十二日社論中，望產業組合總部對同盟罷工一舉應採取愼重態度；反共最力之讀賣新聞於十日社論中謂：產業組合會議之舉動，不異於與國民挑戰，乃社會之公敵云。此十月攻勢乃吉田內閣之重要試騐期，但吉田內閣之有續，決定於外在之因素甚多。吉田於議會幕閉後，十二日接見記者，表明將網續執政，並望自由進步兩黨合併，而華府方面則傳出提早召開對日和會之說，內外情勢說明共黨所號召之十月攻勢，對於吉田內閣並不足以予以致命之打擊。又訊：日政府對　谷事件巾受傷之日警，授以獎章，據日本經濟新聞十四日載稱：東京目黑警察署之川上義廣巡査，於七月十九日襲擊　谷警察署事件時，與殉職之芳賀巡査部長一共執行警務，雖胸部受貫通之重傷，仍不屈服，卒建立拔羣之功績，刻於十五日授以警察功績章及特別章。緣該巡査咸料再起不能，惟刻已吿痊愈，實屬奇蹟。</p>

<p>據陳氏稱：台幣發行，係遵中央政策，當日本投降時，台灣金融情形相當穩定，日本在台灣並無日本正金等各銀行支行，一切以台灣銀行爲中心，政府在接收時爲穩定台省金融，故決定將台灣銀行及其發行之臺幣暫維現狀，於接收完畢後再發行新台灣券，並決定中中交農各行暫不在台設置分行，以待中央新幣制決定後，再行前往設行，俾使台灣之金融仍得維持舊狀，而不受國内金融混亂之波動，至四行職權則由台灣銀行代理執行，台灣銀行放款之利息爲三厘六，最高六厘六，假如其他銀行來台以高利爭取存款，更如以此項存款運用到上海，以一角以上之高利放出，則勢必使台省金融陷於混亂，貨幣乃關係人民之切身問題，當此政策實行時，不但國內不諒解，即台人亦不了解，尤其內地來台之公務員軍人更不了解，但到現在始知倖而施行此政策，始能保持台省人民所有財產之價格，及利息低，物價低，金融穩定之後果，此政策在台省已僉認爲最良好之辦法，在中央幣制物價未穩定前，爲適應環境需要，仍須暫用台幣，以後環境如不需要，自可隨時改用國幣，至台灣銀行業已改成潤有資本之銀行，其董監事均由中央指派，臺幣發行亦完全受中央之監督。</p>

<p>市總工會舉行首次講座市府代表出席說明</p>
<p>本市總工會昨日下午二時，在該會舉行第一次講座，請市府統計處負責人說明工人生活指數編製經過。計到市府代表周世述，社會局處長趙班斧，市黨部周　澤及各業工會二百五十一單位。市府代表周世述報吿工人生活指數編製方法，共分三部份：</p>
<p>（一）編製方法：現在按月公布之工人生活費指數，係以民國三十一年之「家計調査」爲依據，而以民國二十五年爲基期。所謂「家計調査」，乃調査某一階級之一般生活狀况，以便確定各種物品之消費程度，作爲指數內之消費量。其方法係先從記帳入手，再加分析。分析方法，係將各家同種物品消費量相加，以求每一家平均消費量，視消費量決定指數內應包含之物品之種類。只擇其最常用而消費數量最多者，每種選取若干品。現指數內經選定者，有五十四品，食物類：計食米（蕪和），苞米，麵粉（國貨統粉），麵　，黃豆（中粒），鮮猪肉（肋條），鮮牛肉（水牛腰肉），鹹猪肉（肋條），鮮魚，鹹魚，靑菜，菠菜，韮菜，甜薯，白　　，雪菜，黃豆芽，發芽豆，豆腐，豆腐亁，百頁，乳腐，豆油，醬油，　，白糖，茶，高梁等。住屋類：計房屋，開水，電燈，火柴，煤球，木柴等。衣着類：細布，粗布，條格布，花標布，漂布，陰丹士林布，斜紋布，絨布，綫呢，棉花，紗襪等。雜品類：計電車，紙烟，肥皂，草紙，理髪。</p>
<p>（二）物似調査方法：本市物價甚爲混亂，同一物品，物價互異。故調査之方法，區域，及期限，均有嚴格規定。所査店市，視工人分佈地段情形而分配。現在調査地段有：東區（虹口一帶），南區（打浦橋一帶），西區（曹家渡大自鳴鐘一帶）。調査期間，規定爲星期三一次，派員持調査表到各規定店市査塡。</p>
<p>（三）計算方法：先說物價平均方法，指數內採用之每種物價，以各店市價格每星期平均一期、再以各期的算術平均數，爲每月的平均價格。至於指數的計算方法，係按照下列公式計算：最近各界對於指數頗有懷疑。是因編製生活指數的數字，乃以每月的平均價格來計算的。在物價上漲時，指數　不上物價上漲之速度•因每月之平均價，與一天漲跌不同。最近二個月來，米價之穩定，也是指數上漲不大之主因。至指數內五十四品，內容或與五口人日常生活所接觸者，頗有不同之處、故曾考盧將指數內容加以修正，惟須再辦一次「家計調査」。</p>
<p>最後章祝三建議組織生活指數研究委員會，當經推出章祝三，胡　，周中靑，林春庭，朱俊欣，諸維昌，董仁量，國興，萬光章，高國樑，黃悅祥，宋培堯，張金弟，姚卓人，馮綱寅等十五人爲委員。並議決（一）糧食項內黃豆及麥　取消，提高無秈品質。（二）家計調査希望當局重行調査，在調査前，根據十八年生活程度爲標準。（三）指數內增加子女敎育，醫葉等雜費。（四）半月公布指數一次。（五）提高指數。至五時始散。</p>

<p>從農民手裏到消費者腹中，猪在變成肉的過程中須經過不少轉手，因此價格也層層增加。先是由猪販到產地收購，運來上海，集中在蘊藻浜章華浜周家橋一帶的棧房中，然後委託猪行出售。猪行性質與經紀人相同，以都僅盡介紹之責，將毛猪售與肉舖，收取佣金而已，但也有對猪販　款的。肉舖購得毛猪，在屠宰塲宰割後整塊批發與零售肉販，最後始在菜市出售。</p>
<p>昨天的市價，毛猪每市斤二千六百五十元，鮮肉批發價每市斤二千四百元。菜市零售價每市斤則在三千元至四千元之間，視肥瘦而定。批發與零售價之間所以有很大的差異是因爲批發時連皮帶骨，整塊論價，肉阪失之於皮骨的，當然祗有收之於肉價了。</p>
<p>肉價漲，小民愁！相反的，肉商似乎應該肥了。但是與他們隨便談談，却也是滿腹牢騷。他們說：猪玀一物不如紗布糧食可以國積居奇，造成市價上漲的原因，實在是來源短少，爲什麽來源短少？第一因爲主要產地如蘇北一帶時局不靖，豬隻產量受到影響，採辦的猪販子更是望而却步。第二因爲運輪困難，並且一路上關卡重重，留難苛索，更使猪販的成本增高。此外，幣值下跌拆息高昂，猪商將本求利，他們也要付人工，付開銷，肉價上漲似乎也是不可避免之事。所以總之一句話，雖是卑如猪獨也是與軍事政治息息相關！</p>

<p>— 十二日杭州訊　本報記者黃行天</p>
<p>年已古稀的司徒博士，受杜魯門總統之命，出任美國駐華大使，爲國共問題商討國是，斡旋和平，到目前爲止，和平商談雖然未有理想的成果，但司徒先生的那種不辭辛勞，奔走和平的精神，正和他於一九一八年起，出任燕京大學校長，培育英才一樣，是爲全國人民深深地衷心感謝的。</p>
<p>九里松掃先人墓</p>
<p>司徒大使是美國人，但是生長在杭州，這次定十八晨來抗，將往九里松祭其雙親墓，自從一九〇七年被聘爲南京金陵大學神學敎員離開了杭州之後三十餘年來他的大部份光陰都化在北平，很少到杭州來。經過八年抗戰，故鄉雖可說是「無恙」，但懷舊原是人之常情，所以對於司徒大使的在國是猶在沉悶的氣氛中時，偷閑到山明水秀的杭城來，度幾天幽靜的生活，在記者看來，是很需要的。難道司徒博士不該調濟調濟他底生活和精神麽？</p>

<p>司徒大使的故居，就是杭州天漢州橋的耶穌堂。那條路，現在已改作中山北路了。在杭州，這條路是比較淸靜的。敎堂的樣子和普通所見小敎堂一樣，外表是很樸實的。司徒博士的「老家」是並列的三幢二層樓房的中間一幢現在住着司徒博士的高足王樸生即現在杭州基督敎靑年會的總幹事。据那裏的一個年已五十八歲的老先生兪基仙吿訴記者：房子雖已經過三十多年，但大致還是原來的老樣子，沒有什麽變動。房子的內裏是很精緻的。</p>
<p>最溫文童年生活</p>
<p>七十年前（一八七六）傳敎士司徒約翰（John　L．　Stuard）和他底夫人司徒哈同瑪利（MangHarton　Stuard）就在這屋裏生下了第一個孩子，司徒雷登。老司徒先生最初是個敎師，是以傳敎的精神到中國來致力敎育的，所以他辦了個小學。但是敎友對此甚表不滿，以爲傳敎是應該先於辦學。於是關了小學，改做敎堂，這就是今日還聳立在中山北路旁的耶穌堂。那時候，老司徒先生的東鄰是一位姓洪的牧師，西側住着麥小姐，都是敎會裏的人。所以司徒先生的幼年生活，完全是在敎會的空氣中生長的。他與父母一同在華人中旅行，他和中國孩子一樣的學習語言，也學讀學寫，過着中國人一般生活。那個在耶穌堂裏唯一能憶舊談古的老人兪基仙，亦僅能說出司徒先生是三個孩子中最大的一個，也是最溫文的一個而已。記者想探聽一些關於司徒大使的童年生活，但所獲得的答案，就祗有這二個字：「溫文」。</p>
<p>離杭城歷三十載</p>
<p>十一歲起，司徒大使就被他家裏送回祖國去求學，於一八九二年，進弗基利阿的哈姆普頓西德尼大學（Hampden-Sgdney　Colege）讀書，他底最大的興趣，是拉丁文與希臘文。他的希望是成爲一個學者，一個大學敎授。哈姆普頓西德尼，在美國是一個規模較小而能保持她底特點的大學。她底畢業生，被列於名人錄上的數目，比哈佛大學還要多。司徒博士不僅在中國的敎育史上留下了光榮的史蹟，如今，在美國的政治舞台上，也做起重要的配角來了。一九〇四年十一月，他與羅安琳小姐（Aline　Rodd）結婚。當年的十二月又來到杭州，跟他父親在一起生活，同時開始研究中國的古文，以代替拉丁文與希臘文的研究。從那時起，他開始認識中國的文化，進一步地認識了許多中國事情。他在杭州講道二年之後，就生下了他們的獨子小司徒約翰牧師（Rev．John　Stuart）　。又過了一年，他被聘爲南京的神學敎員，從此，就離開了杭州，難得闖到他底第二故鄕來了。</p>
<p>遊舊地湖山增輝</p>
<p>司徒大使離開他底故鄕，已經三十多年了。他在故居歷後手植的榆樹，已經高出了他們的樓房，伸展出粗健的枝幹，繁生着茂盛的葉子，護衛著他們的故居。他底父親和母親的靈柩還安葬在杭州的九里松。他入世第一眼所見的房間和他底夫人生着他們底小司徒約翰的產房，現在都還完好。室內的家具雖換了，但四壁和窗框還是卅年前的老樣子。據王演生先生吿訴記者：司徒大使日前來信，說他老人家決定在他底第二故鄕將有三天的逗留，杭州靑年會已爲此積極籌備歡迎。不但司徒大使的故友舊交要歡迎他，杭州的老百姓也爲這個老年的和平使者底幸臨而非常高興。我相信司徒大使的重游故園，將使湖光山色增加一層新的光彩！</p>
<h3 id="c179">劃時期的訪問　京滬平昆記者團在台北 <a href="#c179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>— 十三日台灣航訊　本報特派員江暮雲</p>
<p>京滬平昆記者台灣參觀團許副部長等二十二人，於十二日上午十時半，渡越海峽在松山飛機塲着陸，從國內東南西北來的記者們，當他們在寬曠的背負着山腰的機場上，迎着海島的秋風每個人都流露着歡欣和熱情。</p>
<p>長官設宴招待</p>
<p>陳長官特別在全台最富麗堂皇的第一貴賓館，歡迎並招待來自遠方的記者們。經許團長一一介紹後，便圍坐在一張大菜檀上，長官很親切而隨意的報吿着本省的現况；經濟，政治，敎育，建設，各方面的進展，長官衣藏靑中山服，精神弈弈，對記者們顯露了非常的關切而熱誠。</p>
<p>午餐後，本報陳總編輯特單獨與長官會談，並答復了總編輯所提出的若干問題。長官招宴是記者們來台的第一個節目，而葛秘書長將在記者們返滬以前在北投歡送他們。</p>
<p>主委暢談台胞</p>
<p>記者團於當日下午第一個節目，是訪問省黨部。摰懇刻實的李主委實中說，合胞國民文化水準較高，他們易於接受黨義，過去他們誤解自由平等，懷疑三民主義，現在已大見進步。</p>
<p>合胞有熱誠，更具有自發的組織能力。人民團體特別多，而且都能切實認眞的做．一般的，二十歲以下的祇能瞭解日語，三十歲以上的大半能瞭解中文。他舉了一個例：方自國內返台的致敬團長林獻堂，就能文能詩。台中一帶的中年人，都能寫中文。</p>
<p>「受日本帝國主義壓迫五十八年的台胞，他們始終未忘祖國」，靑年團李主任友邦，台北游市長。省參議會副會長李萬居們都這樣對記者團說。</p>
<p>他們特別指出來台訪問三天的美記者格雷的話，顯有極大的錯誤。格雷說，要是合灣人能投票選擇主人的話，第一是美國，第二是日本，第三是中國。這樣的觀察，不啻對省胞的侮辱，合胞有着傳統的愛國心，他從沒忘記祖國，永遠不會忘記祖國。</p>
<p>代表省胞之一的敎育處副處長宋斐如，他舉了簡單的例子，說明國內和海島之間的認識上保有相當的距離。他說，最近某中學招考，試題是昆明在何省，有人竟答以在浙江，所以在史地方面要加强灈輸，自屬必要。可是國內對台胞也有誤解，如民政處副處長謝東閔在上海時，就有人問他，台灣人聽說頭上有兩雙角的，這種笑話很多。</p>
<p>他深切希望，祖國不要留六百三十萬省胞於四萬萬同胞之外，他們期待着祖國的愛。</p>
<p>參議會長訴苦</p>
<p>省參議會長黃朝琴，他向記者團訴苦。他說，省人期待該會太殷，要是某一提案在上午十二時前不能通過時，下午二時就可以看見報紙上駡你，甚至使參議員不能回家，民衆們會以吹打道士作出喪似的諷刺着。相反的，要是某一提案圓滿解決了，就不惜數千元廣吿費，刋登「感謝狀」。其實他們不知參議會的性質，它是沒有決定權的。</p>
<p>他回憶着去年今日，民衆歡迎國軍的熱誠，他們大部夜臥車站，恭候從福建來的抗戰士兵，可是這情景不久便使他們失望了。</p>
<p>在登用本省人才曁工廠方面，他盼望政府給省人便利，並儘先錄用。</p>
<p>團長提供新聞</p>
<p>領導「找尋新聞綫索」的許團長，他在游市長宴上，却給本省同業提供了新聞事實。他扼要地闡述戰時新聞重心渝·蓉·昆明，桂林的情形，還就新聞行政和報導技巧上說明中央對報業的政策。他說，在戰時沒有一家報社不遵守新聞檢査的，如今這個制度取消了，回復新聞自由，這個自由是寶貴的；在報導上要憑事實，不要造謠，誹謗，而摧殘了自由。新聞事業的範圍廣，人才不够，目前顯著的進步是事實，但還不能如理想，這是需要我們自己充分努力的。</p>
<p>博物館與民主</p>
<p>參觀博物館時，公園裏正值全市首屆運動會，學生們擠滿了廣塲，一部份則在圖書室裏翻閱書册。記者們對這些破衣跣足新生的第二代，都留有深刻的印象。博物館裏的合省史料室，特別引起他們的興趣。本報陳總經理，詳爲審視光緒廿四年二月廿八日彰化縣知事殺死日將官賞銀的論示，和書景松的民主共和國旗，他們都說這是台灣最早的民主，由於陳總理的提示，大家便共同圍觀談起民生來了。下樓後，復趨看淸時的火車頭，一行在石徑上閒散地走着，大家都凝視着椰子林裏的秋雲，似已使旅人感到另一種膩味！</p>
<p>參觀樟腦工廠</p>
<p>在省都第一天的最後一個節目，是參觀南門工廠這是專賣局的樟腦工廠。該廠光復前停工了五年，接收後部份開工，該廠採取本樟和芳樟的根枝幹砍片爲原料，蒸空分解而製成白油，芳油，再製樟腦，太皮宜油（Terinpul），紅油，綠色油和瀝靑等，本年全部生產量達一千一百噸，明年預增二百噸。（過去年產最高額八百萬公斤。）目前美國人造樟腦，似已奪去了天然樟腦的市塲，但醫藥和高級香料，仍得使用天然樟腦，所以英美直接洽購的有好幾家，他們希望每噸能售二千美元。</p>
<p>想起天下一家</p>
<p>記者團一行十三日上午十時四十五分搭火車離開了台非，他們將以四天的時間付給中南部，一天巡視基隆港，海島最富饒的西部濱海原野，將留有他們的屐痕。許團長決定在十八日晚以參政會駐會委員資格，召開本省參政員座談，並對省胞廣播。在預定十九日離台前，還有一個特別插曲：準備爲中宣部台灣特派員兼中華日報社長盧冠羣證婚。</p>
<p>記者本人赴機塲迎接了本報陳總經理和同業的前輩們，今晨又揮手歡送了他們南行，深感到正如威爾斯所說的，地球平面的距離給飛機的航程愈縮愈短了，他可能於二十四小時內從紐約到西伯利亞去打臘，獲鹿而歸。此次各記者則以二小時半的時間，從滬濱到合灣，天下原本來一家，何况台灣是光復後新生的一角？想起了這，使記者像已看到了本省與外省親兄弟似的握手底熱情，該不再是遠景了吧。</p>
<h3 id="c180">湘參會議長趙炎午　談李銳軍糧案 <a href="#c180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>〔中央社南京十八日電〕記者昨閱十七日上海申報所載長沙訊「李銳五萬石軍糧案」新聞一則，特走訪湘省參讖會議長趙炎午先生，詢其究竟，承吿此案經過如下：</p>
<p>湘省本年災情嚴重，配購軍糧困難，六月底停止配購後，軍糧供應，端賴贛黔糧接濟及就地採購。湘省田糧處於七月五日由中原公司承購軍糧一萬石，其時長沙榖價尙高於訂購法價一萬三千五百元，八月二日又由民國大學生產事業管理處承購軍糧一萬石，其時濱湖糧價已低，該處訂價仍爲一萬三千五百元。從糧價言則嫌稍高，又六七兩月積欠聯動總部湖南供應局軍糧，該處於七月卅一日折發行金榖三萬石，係遵照糧食部後勤部電令辦理，以每石一萬三千五百元核發，（聞依糧部電，每包尙可增運費四千元。）聞均經呈報省政府核准有案。湘參議會對此案曾提出質詢，經李廳長銳出席說明，僉認爲李廳長本人作事坦白，並無違法情弊，惟承辦人員，辦理手續不無錯誤，已函請省府査明核辦矣云云。</p>

<h3 id="c181">哀鴻之音　陜省參議會泛起一片小波浪 <a href="#c181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>— 二日西安航訊　本報特約記者李馳</p>
<p>無風議會　陜西省參議會第一屆第二次大會，上月十五日開幕，經過十七天從未間斷的集會，延至十月一日才正式閉幕。此次出席的省議員，凡八十多名，先後共通過四百多件提案。然而綜合這次大會所得的印象，總覺得「不够勁」，半個多月的議程始終在相當「風平浪靜」中進行，其間沒有「一鳴驚人」的「爆彈質問」，也沒有唇槍舌劍的「論戰」，借用一個新聞熟語：「無風議會」，即使有，也僅僅是小彼浪而已。不過從會塲中官方施政報吿，和參議員們溫和的質詢之中，我們仍然可以找出許多新聞資料，用以補充日常報章記述的不足。</p>
<p>八年抗戰中日軍一再企圖「破門而入」，但結果，陝西並沒有半寸土地淪陷敵手，這是我們的好福氣。勝利以後，內戰的火舌却終而由中原舐進省境，中共李先念所部於七月下旬由河南進入陝南，據當時消息，衝突地區祗限於商南，龍駒寨一帶的四五個縣份，並且大約自從八月中旬以後，此間報紙就沒有透露過關於這問題的任何記載，這次治安當局向省議會作如下的報吿，尙是首次的透露，值得重視。</p>
<p>治安救濟　陝省保安司令戴桂茂氏的報吿上說：「共軍李先念部於本年七月十五日竄入陜境，八月廿五日竄入甘肅華亭，本省被蹂躪者達二十縣份。」又，「目下尙有一萬多人在西郊公路上」。</p>
<p>陜省主席祝紹周氏的施政報吿中，亦有提及：「鄂北之李先念部及主樹聲部竟於七月十五日由豫鄂邊境分別進入本省商南鎭平等縣地區，……王樹聲所部於八月被阻回竄鄂境。四處突擾之李先念部亦遭受阻擊，紛紛潰散，現第一戰區長官部對於殘匪已擬有整個之處理辦法。……」</p>
<p>從上面兩個報吿看，共軍此次時入陝境，至今還是個並未完全了結的題目。陝保安司令部又發表稱：「竄犯白河共軍，週前進擾鎭安縣城，經地方團隊及民衆合力圍剿，業於九月廿六日擊潰。……」當前緊急的問題，可參看省府最近通過的「緊急救濟匪害區域辦法」條文。其中載稱：屬受害最重的有山陽，鎭安，維南，商縣等四縣。屢次重縣份商南，柞水，寗陝，佛坪，麟遊等六縣。屬較輕縣份有留壩，洋縣，隴縣等三縣。此次參議會中來自陝南的代表，曾一再爲該地區人民呼籲。</p>
<p>冰雹殺牛　陝省人民除人禍外，還有天災！據社會處長陳固亭氏在省參議會的報告：「本省報春災者二十二縣，夏災者七縣，都已發賑麥賑款，另有報夏災者七縣，秋災三十一縣」。對於災區人民，省府雖然一本「多予少取」的基本原則來多方救濟，但人民的負担仍然繁重。請聽商縣一位代表的呼籲：「商縣十五萬民眾都在「災」與「匪」包圍中過生活，民眾負担公家攤派的款項，卻在七億八千萬元以上。今年商縣降冰雹，此雹之大，打得死耕牛！……」</p>
<p>徵實徵借　關於今年田賦徵實徵借的數單問題，省參議會有了重要的決定，政府預定數字，是徵實徵借各一百二十萬市石，附加省縣級公糧百分之三十，即三十六萬市石。這數字比起往年借糧爲徵糧百分之一百約减去一百六十多萬市石。省參議會方面希望：「田賦附加百分之百，本省本年度未徵之五十，仍予豁免。其徵借一項，照往年成例「徵一借半」，勿事增加。」該會並電請當局，於撥還糧食庫券項下，以八分之交·五歸還地方，其餘八分之一·五作補助敎育設備等費。按照本年六月全國財糧會議的決定，田賦徵實數額中省府僅得百分之二十，縣級倒可獲得百分之五十。陜省府今年下半年預算，已核准的支出共一百二三十億元中，可靠的收入不過三十餘億元，這將近一百億元的「赤字」，實是一個可怕的數字。據說：按照規定，在這六們月中，省府可請求中央撥助行政費，但不得超過三個月。最近由京返陝的財政廳長吿記者：中央已撥下七，八，九，月份補助費三十餘億元，另外還有十餘億元是補助稅款之征收未達所預期之數字者。下半年度財政收支表，尙在南京審核中。不敷之數，怕不外乎由中央補助彌縫。</p>
<p>儘管省府的賬册上，有如許偌大的「赤字」，但當局仍有勇氣去設計與厘訂長期的龐大的建設計劃，五年不足，展至六年，期在今年起至民四十年完成。這初步的草案已提交本次省參議會審核。</p>
<p>陝西省銀行和隴海鐵路局，曾先後受到省參議會的指摘。前者是關於它的業務處置，後者因近來車皮缺乏，引起了煤，紗，麵粉價格日益看漲。路局方面，近日似乎已有接受善意建議跡象。</p>
<p>武裝販毒　最後，筆者要記述到本來想略而不提的陝省禁政問題。據官方估計：陝省的「癮君子」，共達十萬人光景。因此，陜省辦禁政，實在是一樁棘手的問題。據說某一個地區有大量的鴉片在偷運，實際情形則尚待證實。官方此次在參議會中並且首次的透露：川陜邊境，今春曾一度發現烟苗云云。</p>
<p>「武裝運毒」在陝省並不鮮見，據民政廳長在會塲中報吿：自一月至七月動用武力去査緝運毒而發生「交戰」（此二字係引自原文）者，凡八十二次！先後緝獲烟土達五千餘兩！又據祝主席另一報吿，則一月至八月共査獲烟犯一千一百多人，繳獲販毒者之武裝，計步槍七枝，機關槍四挺，手槍五十四枝，手溜彈四十二枚，另外尚有烟土，贓款，黃金，白銀若干。保安司令部補充民廳的報吿說：在同期內，尙緝有一千多兩烟土，及六十多萬元烟款。</p>
<p>陜省府決定自本年十一月起在三個月內，强迫一切鴉片中毒者戒除烟癮，預備一億元以上和幾千兩烟土作爲實施禁政的消耗。如能按期順利完成，當然是一件至高無上的德政。可是一切施政計劃的實効最後還是決定於最低級的執行者，關於禁政方面，尤爲明顯。副議長李夢彪氏在閉幕那一天，說了一句頗沉痛的話：「將本次參議員之所言，比作「哀鴻之音」希望得有如願以償的一天」。</p>

<p>報載新中國劇社三十多位社員和幾位滇教應劇教戲隊員趁行總難民車離昆來滬，在貴陽關嶺場附近翻車，死傷二十七人，這真是戲劇界的損失！</p>
<p>新中國劇社是在桂林成立的，社員大多數是愛好藝術的青年，他們朝氣勃勃，刻苦研究，因爲經費少阻礙多，受了好些挫折。後來去湘潭衡陽各處演劇，得到當地人士的歡迎和幫助，社務緄有進展。後因湘桂戰事劇變，才流浪到昆明，是大後方優秀的職業劇團。</p>
<p>桂林開第一屆戲劇展覽會的時候，「新中國」戰譽歸來，參加演出。那時候他們可說是走紅了，而他們仍然過着有規律的生活，沒有沾染半點習氣，全體團員一致地過着藝術至上的生活，經濟公開，生活費以外的錢都用來發展社務，前途正是不可限量！</p>
<p>於今勝利複員，他們由昆明來上海，不幸途中遭受翻車慘禍，這真是戲劇界的損失，文化界的損失啊！</p>

<p>— 趙景深</p>
<p>田漢周信芳所召集的平劇座談會，由王鼎成紀錄，已在月刊和前綫日報同時發表。他所紀錄的都是重要的話，我這裏且談一談當時的瑣屑。</p>
<p>大家一致要求郭沫若首先發言，他推辭不掉，便微笑地站起來，他第一句便說：「諸位是好奇！」於是，大家都笑了。他的意思彷彿說，他對於平劇是外行，「你們這些內行（例如周信芳高百歲李瑞來呂君樵姜椿芳等）想聽一聽外行話。」後來他說起，平劇音樂似乎缺少和聲。</p>
<p>鄭振鋒談到臉譜，說起他在歐洲，有一次在英國吧，一座花園裏的草地上散步，看見一座屋子的玻璃窗上，有許多可怕的小頭，面孔上都有五彩的花紋；後來纔曉得這些都是被殺的野蠻人，頭是因爲浸過藥水而變小的。</p>
<p>潘孑農談起川劇臉譜也很有趣。他說川劇青蛇本是一個男子，所以扮作男角。在飲雄黃酒時，有「變臉」的表演。散會後，我向沫若說，這倒有一點像英國史梯文生所寫的「季基爾博士與海德先生」。</p>
<p>吳仭之的話很簡短，却有道理。他說：「平劇每每有許多有劇情無關的自我表現或賣弄，例如武生的要刀之類，這些都應當不怕痛的割愛。必須這是劇情中該有的，方纔可以放進去，否則便成爲賣藝，不像演戲了。」</p>
<p>田漢的設想頗奇，以前歐陽予倩說，許多車輪旗成行列的轉動可以表現機械的轉動；現在田漢却說，旗子上可以晝汽車的摩托作爲汽車，或飛機的葉子作爲飛機。</p>
<p>陳志良說起，教育部改訂的平劇本已經出過不少本，可以作爲很好的參考。</p>
<p>田漢周信芳在六月卄一日又在紅棉酒家召集了一次會。這一次會只是預備出刊物，向朋友們拉稿子。但周信芳談了表演技術上的兩個動作也頗有意思。</p>
<p>他說，表演老頭子老太婆，每每彎腰掬屁股，其實應該彎腰挺胸脯，屁股決不能掬。練這工夫不大容易。</p>
<p>他又談起，崑曲家徐淩雲說起紅梅記算命裏的瞎子，一般人表演瞎子，只是正身拿着竹仗一點一點地點着地在台上走；但實際上並不如此，瞎子既沒有眼睛，全靠耳朶，所以應該側着身子登台，豎着耳朶作聽的樣子，也許嘴也跟着向一面歪。他做了那個動作，非常滑稽。</p>
<p>後來又談到戴愛蓮的「啞子背瘋」，一個人扮兩個人，有人說這與一個山東人扮兩個人打架是一樣的。</p>
<p>信芳說：「平劇裏的啞子背瘋，實是老背少，一手作爲老頭之頭，另一手則爲女子的左手。老頭回過頭來望少女，少女拍地一聲給了他一個嘴巴。」</p>
<p>田漢說：「桂戲又另是一樣。老頭被一般閒人所追逐，一隻手是頂着老頭的假頭，另一隻手却是老頭的左手。他一面回頭望追逐的人，一面搖手叫他們不要追趕，後來又用手作拭淚的姿態。」</p>
<p>以上所記，只憑記憶，當時不曾用筆記，也許不免錯誤，都由我負責。</p>

<p>— 華芬</p>
<p>「清宮外史」的出現，大概轟動了上海的戲迷們了吧！可是，上海的戲迷們你們知不知道早在勝利之前，它已經把重慶的戲迷們迷惑住了，爲了它，人們再一清早就到「抗建堂」等着站班買票，爲了它，還勞動了我們的　主席去看了不算，還在勵志社招待了全體職演員，楊村彬就在那時還蒙　主席的召見，當面慰勉了一番。</p>
<p>政府復員了，人們復員了，「清宮外史」也跟着大夥兒劇人復員到了上海，經過了幾個月的籌備和排演，「觀眾演出公司」拿它來作爲頭炮戲，導演還是由楊村彬自任，演員是第一把交椅的：耿震，沈陽，葉子，陽華，張雁，溫錫瑩等。「中萬」也要演出「清宮外史」楊村彬沒有辦法也祗有答應，不過有個條件，中萬得先在南京上演，大家講定了，於是楊村彬開始忙了，好容易把「觀眾」的戲在辣斐搬上了台，他看了第一場，馬上又被王瑞麟拉到了南京。</p>
<p>「中萬」在南京上演清宮外史，全體演員和團長王瑞麟編導楊村彬也已人馬到齊，不久以前在南京的國民大戲院上演，決定連演十天。演員有舒繍文，陶金，陳天國，阮斐，寇嘉弼，錢千里等，全是優秀演員，和上海的「觀眾」比起來是各有千秋。</p>

<p>別看伊黛露碧諾身材小巧似乎還很年輕，明年的二月四日她就要做三十大慶了。</p>
<p>伊黛熱情地笑，任性地談話，愛說一只關於她自己的笑話，這笑話發生於她的誕生地倫敦。雖然伊黛十三歲時便到美國，戰爭之前，她每年總要回到她父親的戲劇發祥地去一次，以示不忘祖國及家庭撫育之恩。某一年，她和她妹妹回到倫敦後，忽然想去看一次電影。恰巧她們所往的戲院，上星期正好開過她所主演的一張影片。她們車子駛近戲院時，祗見門前擁滿了人羣，直擠得水洩不通，伊黛對她妹妹說：「我的影片上星期在這裡開映時一定生意興隆，看呵，他們都來歡迎我了。」但是，誰把她光臨英倫的消息洩露的呢？她冤枉一定是她妹妹搗的鬼，但她妹妹却矢口否認。這時伊黛一眼看見戲院的進口處鋪着一條紅地氈，她大喊起來，「一定全倫敦的人都知道我來了。」當她下了車後，她裝出最好的態度，一面向羣眾鞠着躬準備走進戲院去，但正在這時候，她却聽見背後一個倫敦警察，高聲喊道：「女士們快快走上前，英國王子馬上就要抵達了。」</p>
<p>不用說，伊黛那時的臉是脹得像豬肝般的紅，但她今日仍敢逢人告訴，足見她心地純潔，勇於認過呢！</p>

<p>演員是演出的主要部份，通過演員，劇作家才能把他的思想具體的表達給觀眾，而且演員又是直接和觀眾接觸的，因此，決定演出的好壞，演員的份量是很重的，這次演出中，演員們表現得有一個特點，那就是一般地說來，是很平衡的，而且他們保持了一個優良的作風，他們不在舞台上特殊地表露自己，或者賣弄噱頭，引人注意，他們都服從演出，而又合作得很好。</p>
<p>葉子　葉子的慈禧太后，在這戲裏很吃重，幾乎一部「清宮外史」都環繞在她的週圍，拿她來做主線，她的好壞，對整個演出是舉足輕重的，葉子把這個人物刻畫得深刻神似，她的一舉一動，一言一笑，都足以振惑觀眾的心絃，顯得她是下過一番功夫，而又表現得那樣老練，讓我有如置身五十餘年前的大清王朝，得一睹這叱咤一世，主宰了中國的女統治者，而又有些傈於她的淫威了。慈禧是一個自信力很強的人，在她的生活裏很少有原始真實情感的流露，因而她的心情是很寂寞的，她要找歡樂，她愛說，愛笑，愛熱熱鬧鬧，可是她自己可能不直接參於這些場面的，她也許僅是愛聽人家說，愛看人家笑，從人家的說笑裏；她可能找到溫暖，掃掉寂寞。（譬如慈禧的台詞：「……今天咱們不拘禮典，越是能說能笑的，我越喜歡……」——第二幕）而葉子却會讓她的角色縱情的大笑，笑得那麼尖銳，似乎就顯得有些輕飄不隱，和她角色的身份和心情就不太相合了。</p>
<p>耿震　耿震飾的光緒皇帝，是大清帝國一個最可憐的皇上了，這是一個所謂「正面」的角色，但劇作者似乎在處理這種正面角色上，遠不如他處理特殊的人物來得生動，在劇本本身光緒就有些平扳，很少有什麽起伏的，因而，這個角色演起來較吃力，耿震是個好演員，他不節外生枝的來替這角色加添些什麽，而只是安份地把劇本中給他的，和要求他的都一一表現無遺，讓我們爲這個軟弱的皇上嘆息，憐憫，同情，和憤怒。</p>
<p>陽華飾的李蓮英，這是全劇最大而又最表面的「反面」人物了，劇本給得這角色很豐富，陽華演這個角色是很得體的，他諂媚，卑下，陰險，惡毒，刻畫出一個外表和性格雙重醜惡的人物來，幾乎讓我們覺得他是大清帝國背後隱隱的一個可怖的陰影，陽華是個有才能的演員，可是當戲正在進行，和戲演完了之後，我們總覺得他的表演和全體不太協調，總像多了一樣什麽東西，那就是往往有些地方稍嫌過火，如果能把這過火的地方稍稍收斂，則他的表演可說是很出色的了。</p>
<p>沈揚　沈揚的寇連材演得最生動，一個天真，淳厚，不知天高地厚，而又忠心耿耿，正義凜然的角色，他演來活神活現，他博得了觀眾的掌聲，笑聲，博得了崇敬和眼淚，更博得了觀眾對他演技的讚美。</p>
<p>翁同龢，皇帝的老師，一個滿腹經綸，自高自大，而又頑固的老頭子，張雁演得甚如人意，尤其是和李鴻章爭得面紅耳赤，在太后面前慷慨陳詞，有聲有色，在創造角色的外形上，讓人一見就會知道這是一位自信力強，而又固執的老人來。</p>
<p>李鴻章，這個當時新興的買辦階級的代表人，一個投機家，兩面派，結果被攻擊得狼狽不堪，而被摒棄了的人物。這角色是很難扮演的，溫錫瑩却處理得有條不亂，不卑不亢，確實合乎他隨時標榜的「中庸之道」了。</p>
<p>楊戳的珍妃，冀淑平的瑾妃，和傅惠珍的李大姐，莫愁的皇后都演來精采，只是劇本中給得她們太少了，譬如劇作者在處理珍妃上，就遠不如李大姐，有時真讓我們捉摸不出珍妃怎樣會得到皇上的寵愛，和她對皇上的影響來，當然演員就無從更多地給這角色一點內容了。</p>

<p>— 馬博良</p>
<p>幸運先生</p>
<p>也許是美國的一種戀愛風氣，「名媛弄情記」「新生」「合歡花」以致這張「幸運先生」都有一樣的中心，富家千金愛上了窮漢子，生活在資本社會裏的人的夢想，借了一個賭棍的嘴巴，編劇人痛快地斥責了階級的婚姻，金枝玉葉也只好屈服了，爲我把領帶打好吧，她立在樓梯上遵從了愛情的命令，領帶歪斜踽踽獨行的人不是都希求這個幸運嗎？這張片子原來的意旨並不像「紅塵三客」，可是它製造了不少輕鬆的笑料，自然，不誇張，流暢·輸血處等候　上相遇和交談，輕快得如跳動的曲綫，被迫學識絨綫的一幕，滑稽唐突，不落俗套，令人忍俊不禁。導演波德是新人，手法新穎，開端碼頭的話舊，兩扇門拉開了故事，收場時閉攏兩扇門也就閉攏了故事。有人不喜歡結局的大團圓，主張讓它成爲一個惆悵的悲劇，我卻是覺得富家女碼頭追踪未免近乎殘酷，因此霧中的苦盡甘來的香吻也正是我們代爲期望的。遺憾的是，賭棍的姜良本性還未表達充足，始終仍是不脫壞蛋的本色，不夠作爲名門閨秀的情郎，其次是「幸運先生」沒有發展成一個純粹的喜劇，失卻更多的諷刺的機會。</p>
<p>卡萊憂倫演賭棍，自然是操縱自如，但不及「瘋狂世家」的嚴若遊龍，「瘋狂世家」是他在喜劇上的最高峯了。拉琳黛風徽　然，嫵媚溫雅，表現精明幹練的品行和含情脈脈的神韻功力相等，我真喜歡她嫣然微笑凝眸睇望的明麗Cute和Chie二者兼備。</p>
<p>女兒城</p>
<p>這是一張暴露性的社會片，不是喜劇，看到的是剝下了虛偽表皮的美國小城的社會，有很可以發展的題材，可惜缺乏美妙的整理，導演薛尼沙何應該受到毀譽參半的評價。他的光榮是他對於女子公寓的處置，一羣婦女含辛茹苦在靜候着親人出獄歸來，汽笛聲是囚犯進飯，鐘聲卻是親骨肉處刑的徵象，落雨的天，玻璃窗上淚痕斑斑的臉，她們做着夢，期待着，萎黃的等待的時間，就這些抑鬱的場面夠好了，其他俱屬蛇足。演員各有千秋，自行刻劃一種個性。女主角林達黛妮兒照例是閃爍可人，綽約多姿，演技是正派戲較之反派戲略爲遜色。</p>
<h3 id="c189">林黛達妮兒主演「女兒城」 <a href="#c189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>歌場魅影</p>
<p>有人說中國的「夜半歌聲」的故事脫胎於此，所述又是變態藝人的恐怖事，與曼兒奧白朗喬治山德士的「暴雨梨花」和林達黛妮兒的「瘋狂藝人」實出一轍。但是攝影氛圍攝影導演都是後兩張爲佳。納爾遜埃第的歌喉雄健如故，可惜所唱不是英文的歌劇，難以欣賞，還是注意裝置和結尾神秘面具大會，倒底這是領過獎的片子。</p>

<h3 id="c190">送友人留學英國序 <a href="#c190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>— 徐仲年</p>
<p>民國三十五年十月十七日晨，張蒨英女士，張安治，陳曉南，費成武三先生，將乘機出國，留學英倫：這是極可喜的事！一方面，我們慶賀敎育部揄選得人：他們早年卒業於國立中央大學，都是徐悲鴻先生的得意門生。他們中間，早的卒業於民國二十年六月，晚的也在乎民國二十五年一月：這就是說，至少卒業了十年又十個月！在此悠長的時間裏，他們的努力引起了社會的重視，激發了藝術界的同情，基定了自身的學術地位。另一方面，我們不能不承認他們是幸運兒：際此國家多事，學術寂退，中國文化已經到了窒息的地步，他們居然有機會出國深造，不但所呼吸的空氣將是新鮮純潔的空氣，沒有銅臭，沒有負污的腐味，而且還能欣賞所愛欣賞的作品，學習所愛學習的藝術，較之我們這批所謂文化人也者，留在祖國，欲求上進而環境不允許我們上進，眞有天壤之分！</p>
<p>或者有人說：現代的中國，只需要科學，不需要藝術。這種見解無異乎說：爲人最重物質，精神爲末。首先我懷疑科學能否脫離精神而發達？即使可能，物質文明畸形的進展是否人類的幸福？論技巧，藝術是科學；論精神，藝術的對象是魂靈。在唯物與唯心之間，藝術給我們一種調劑：所以藝術是積極的，不是消極的；是必需品，而非奢侈品。漫說：「藝術建國」：單靠藝術不足以建國；然而建國而忽略藝術，甚至踢開藝術，這樣建成的國家只有驅殼，沒有魂靈！這是說諸位責任繁重，也是說諸位前程遠大。</p>
<p>藝術的對象旣然是魂靈，當然兼指「人」「我」。藝術家以作品去感動人，去美化人生。然而藝術家自己先得培養一種內在的感動力一種肉眼所不能見的磁力。如欲培養這種磁力，這種感動力，單賴表面的技巧是不够的，必需充實自已的魂靈，提高自己的魂靈。在當代中國的藝術家靈中，——我僅指油畫家，因爲四位雖則畫兼中西，直到目前，主要的還是西畫，——儘有技術高超的人，只可惜「腹儉」的人更佔多數！腹有詩書氣自華：難道專指文學家麼？不！藝術家亦復如此。充實魂靈，提高魂靈，有賴乎博覽羣書。一個衣着華美，而談吐齷俗的人：我們呌他什麽？呌他「暴發戶」！一個技巧純熟，但繪起畫來，欠風雅，無內涵的人：我們呌他什麽？呌他「畫匠」！如果你們只曉得繪畫，不求廣知，不利用外國優良的學術環境去涉獵文學，哲學，甚至音樂，庸以養性陶情，你們祇會有表面的造就，你們的作品不會有魂靈。痛快些說：在你們的師友中間，草包委實太多了，用不到再加你們四個！</p>
<p>你們是悲鴻的學生，由好予人「帽子」的中國批評家（？）看來，你們應當列入學院派。在他們的意思，學院派象徵落伍。他們所崇拜的乃是未來派，立體派，達達派，野獸派。殊不知遠在第二次世界大戰以前，這些出現於一九一〇——一九一七間的學派早已過了時。學院派仍卓然存在。譬如練習寫字，不妨先從「九成宮」着手，打好根基，再求變化：學院派便是藝術的「九成宮」。何况新派大師如畢加索之流。當他練習時，是道地的學院派。爲學祇問正宗，不求時髦：自已打定主義，立定脚跟；萬千莫做風鷄，東南西北隨風而轉！</p>
<p>我旣然提起了學院派，未來派等等，我就勸你們：學藝術，法國和意國，不可不去：這兩國在藝術上的地位實在勝過英國。意大利是古典派的大本營，也是未來派的發祥地；而法蘭西的首都巴黎，兼蓄並收，更爲洋洋乎大觀！然而，話又得說回來，並非在英吉利學不到東西。儘够你們學！儘够！不過，在英國打好根底，—不，增强你們已經良好的根底，——再去法意，廣廣見識。何况在巴黎，你們可以逢到先後出國二十餘年，你們的老師，我的朋友潘玉良女士！</p>
<p>你們準備留英兩年，即使長期，也不過四年：時間太短，你們務須格外動勉，方能對得住國家，對得住悲鴻，對得住你們自己！然而，今天下午我向你們道別時，你們個個唇紅歲白，身體健康。我希望你們出國時如此，歸來時也如此！我要不要向你們背誦：「工作時間工作，玩耍時間玩耍：這是成功快樂之路」呢？復次，我有幾句話特別叮囑安治，曉南，成武三人：在倫敦，巴黎，羅馬，在歐洲其它各大都會，玩的機會太多，尤其在女色方面。留學生中往往有淘壞身子的人，我雖則喜歡吃蹄膀，却不希望吃帶孔的冷猪頭肉：所以我的叮囑不在乎道德，——法朗斯說：「爲何把道德放得那麽下呢？」——却一本乎找的健康至上主義！人而不健康，學問雖好有何用？</p>
<p>當年唐朝的皇帝親送三藏出國求經，敬法師一杯酒，忽抓一撮黃土在酒裏，希望三藏飲了不忘故鄉。這雖是稗官之首，但很有意義。你們是中國人：即使目前的中國混亂得厲害，祖國終於是祖國，月亮是英國的好，但中國的月亮更好！你們切切不可忘掉你們的祖國，忘掉你們的老師，忘掉你們的親友，以及……忘掉你們的使命！</p>

<h3 id="c192">最偉大的戰地記者　恩尼·派爾 <a href="#c192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>— 張蔭槐</p>
<p>成千累萬沒有名姓的戰士，在沙塲上前仆後繼，冒着槍彈流着熱血，換來一次又一次的勝利。他們的戰蹟像埃及的金字塔永垂史頁，他們的生命却如堆砌金字塔的巖石，或者竟如金字塔畔的沙粒，永遠沒有人提起。</p>
<p>只有恩尼·派爾（Ernie　Pule)，穿了身充滿微摺油汚的櫻色戰地記者制服，拖着他的矮小永不感覺疲乏的身體，隨著大軍，從北菲到西西里，從諾曼第到冲鄉，將切身體昧到的小兵們日常生活的甘苦，前綫殺敵的勇敢，親切感動地報道給全世界，使永遠印在人們的心坎裏。</p>
<p>恩尼派爾及其愛犬</p>
<p>恩尼是個愛和平，憎恨戰爭的人。只是他也更愛自由，明白這次是爲自由而不得不苦戰的戰爭。從這種觀點，他是最瞭解小兵們的人。他同兵士吃一樣粗糲單調的食物，夜晚一樣睡泥地的散兵壕，深深體味著小兵的歡樂與苦痛，勇敢與懦怯。用他同情而感動的筆調，寫下了緊張而又平凡的戰鬥生活。恩尼不是英雄，因此他筆下的主角也不是傳奇式的英雄，只是平平常常有血有肉你我一般的普通人，有生的熱望，也有死的恐懼——他的同情而慈祥的筆調終於撼動了後方千萬人民的心，得到了前綫苦苦作戰的無名者的熱烈愛戴。</p>
<p>至於將軍們的戰爭，恩尼留給了寫頭號標題的記者們。恩尼的戰爭就是那種不同於將軍們的戰爭。</p>
<p>美國著名小說家「怒火花」與「月沉」等書作者約翰·史坦因培克如此說：「世上有兩種各不相涉的戰爭。地形啊，戰略啊，火力啊，後方勤務啊，部隊調動啊，那種種是將軍們的戰爭。其次是對懷鄉病的戰爭，對倦怠，譏刺，粗暴，抱怨食物這種種的戰爭——那是恩尼·派爾的戰爭。對於這些事情，人家知道的，他全知道，却比任何人寫得更好。」</p>
<p>恩尼是個謙讓，勤儉，不大愛講話的人。原名恩斯德·派爾Ernest　Pyle，），美國印第安那州人，生於一九〇〇年。當就讀於印第安那州立大學新聞系。學業後曾工作於多家報館。直到珍珠港一役後，一躍而爲全美最負盛名最爲讀者愛讀的一個戰地記者。他常出入於最前綫。他隨着美軍遍歷北菲，進入西西里，跨海北登意大利，然後回到英倫，看他們轟炸納粹，準備侵入大陸。一九四四年六月，又隨大軍在諾曼第登陸，長驅直入，進軍巴黎。</p>
<p>這三四年間，恩尼每天寫的戰地通訊，爲全美三六六家報紙闢爲專欄，三一〇家週刋轉載，讀者總數在一千二百廿五萬五千人以上。這些通訊經彙編出版了兩本集子：「這裏是你們的戰爭」與「勇士們」。前者銷九十四萬册，後者八十六萬册。直到現在，道些數字還在時刻增加中。</p>
<p>一九四五年初，他隨海軍來到太平洋。他曾在航空母艦上目睹冲綱島的攻克。他是時時在最前綫的。可是厄運開始了。四月十八日淸晨，恩尼在大硫黃島前綫，被日軍機關槍彈所擊中，受了重傷。延至同日上午十时十五分，不治殉難。</p>
<p>恩尼死了，他是死在離前進指揮站一哩的最前綫的。行囊中還藏着一些永遠未完成的遣稿：「最後之一章」。這些每一章，一節，一句，一字，都是以生命換來的記載，替成千累萬默默地戰鬥，默默地死去的勇士們，留下了一個永恒的親切的塑像。</p>

<h3 id="c194">何處是青春 <a href="#c194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>— 謝紫</p>
<p>流行歌曲中，有一支叫作「何處是靑春」，這支歌，我有一種偏愛。聽的時候，可以想象到作曲者的心情；歌辭是肯定的，曲譜是否定的，唱的聲音，更是一百個否定。那稚拙而牽强的歌辭，給曲譜和歌聲掩蓋了，我們所聽到的不是一個肯定的整體，而是些斷斷續續的哀怨的誄辭：秋天的風，秋天的花，輕輕的吹，悄悄的謝，一切彷彿在秋天—一支纏綿哀怨的秋之歌！靑春已經在秋風秋雨中萎謝了，只剩下一縷淡淡的殘香，留在那潮濕的黃綠色的落葉。</p>
<p>我想起了另外看到的一幅畫，一篇短篇小說的插圖，小說的題名叫「年靑的時候」，圖裏面有一株小小的樹，一株生命的樹，太陽照在樹葉上，閃爍着銀樣的光；樹旁邊有一個少女，踮着脚，探身向前，想要够到那株樹；她穿着薄薄的衣服，輕盈而嬝娜；刺眼的陽光，和淸晨的迷霧，交織在一起—一個充滿了希望的靑春的象徵。可是讀一讀那篇小說，小說的內容却是否定的，讀完了小說再看那插圖，覺得那插圖也像是一篇誄辭：追述一個已經失去了的靑春的回憶。</p>
<p>於是我想：在人類的心靈中，完滿的靑春幾乎是不可能存在的，無論如何，總要有一點缺陷。假如說月缺花殘是一件悲哀的事，可是圓滿的月亮，茂盛的花朶，到底還常常可以看到；而一個完滿無缺的靑春，却幾乎是打着燈籠都沒處去找的。</p>
<p>有，也許有，在那些不識不知，無憂無慮者的心中，也許可以找到一個完滿的靑春。然而沒有反省，沒有解悟，至多也只能是完整而不是完滿。有了反省，有了解悟，假知依舊是完滿的話，那完滿也不過是和月亮一般的完滿；在月亮裏面，有着被稱爲月桂樹的黑影。</p>
<p>這黑影有時候會遮住青春的光華，正好像那哀怨的譜曲遮住一首肯定的歌辭那樣，看上去有一點迷惘。</p>
<p>何處是青春？何處是靑春？似乎不必問了。我們可以看到許多閃爍的晶瑩的靑春的星，而永不會看到一個完滿的沒有黑影的靑春的月。</p>

<p>— 葉勁風</p>
<p>「您二位，是兩位學生吧，是趕火車？」又指了指案上的饅說，「您餓了，這饅不中吃，」說着又打量了我們一下，「要不上裏間來，我跟您作點什麽……出門人可眞苦哩……」</p>
<p>她打量我們，可是我們也在打量她哩。我瞧這婦人愛說話，知道不會壞到那裏，就點了點頭，邀過虎弟，走進店裏。婦人搶上前去打起帘子來。誰知道裏間並沒有屋子，僅僅是個廚房，放着許多亂七八糟的東西。婦人待我們進了屋子，放下帘子，屋子驀一暗，她於是自已反走到我們前頭說，「這屋子沒天光，看不大淸楚，留神撞着。」我們隨她轉過那個大土窇，眼前陡地是一亮，原來她把側邊的屋門開了。這倒叫我奇怪，這屋子怎樣造的。</p>
<p>出了側門，原來還有一個小院子，後面就是幾間平房。婦人讓我們進了平房，好像貴客似的，招待我們起來，嘴裏盡客氣話：「屋子小，貴客連請都請不到，這兒又窄又窮，那裏比得前頭哪。」說着又連向隔屋子喊「翠姐，客來哪，你過來接待一下。」</p>
<p>「不是黑店？」我想起從前看的「小五義」，「七劍十三俠來。」</p>
<p>一會兒那翠姐來了，叫我吃了一驚，那面貌舉動打扮一切都像我從前北京的一位同學。</p>
<p>「咦！」我不禁岔口叫了出來，「您在北平××中學念過書？」</p>
<p>「不是××中學，」翠姐微微一笑，臉上泛起兩朶紅雲，「是城西女中，敎會學校。」</p>
<p>「噢！」我在追憶，「您貴姓，可是……」</p>
<p>「賤姓計。」她有些茫茫地，好像也在追憶，「我知道哪…媽…」她回頭對那位愛說話的媽說，「咱表姐可不是在××中學念過？」</p>
<p>「瞧這孩子，」她媽笑着一拍手，「這些年我又沒進京去過，誰還記得什麽什麼中學，你說表姐，那不是你三姨的小玉兒？」又冲着我說，「我後邊去一會來，您請談談罷。」邊說邊走，到屋子後進去了。</p>
<p>「對哪」翠姐又對我說，「我有個表姐叫黃玉華，比我大了六七歲，在××中學念過書……她跟我長的的一個臉盤子。……」說到這裏，她瞧了瞧了虎弟，臉又紅了。</p>
<p>「對哪，」我猛地想明白了；她表姐可不就是我說的那個同學？可是黃玉華這三個字倒記不得了，我在那裏只待了半年多，又隔了這三四年，當然記不住了。「她現在還念書？」我想問問下落。</p>
<p>「早沒念哪……噢！」她臉上忽然轉變了一種凄慘可憐的顏色。「她跟我們一樣，—窮下來哪；」她低下了頭，拈起了一片衣角。</p>

<p>「子非魚，安知魚之樂？」</p>
<p>「子非我，安知我之不知魚之樂？」</p>
<p>我固非子，子亦非我……於是爭辯而不能有結論矣。今日，上海第一等動物是熊貓，大家都熱中於談論牠，然而無論怎樣，即使理解牠到透頂，我們畢竟是人。牠死得慘也好，不慘也好，都是用人的感情或理智來揣擬的。</p>
<p>有一個事實是確切不移的，牠的死，是爲了生活環境的改變所致。我們已知道主其事者爲了牠的不惜工本的種種了，甚至從四川用飛機運麥麩來做牠的飼料。</p>
<p>牠到底不是一隻普通的狗，人對於狗的知識知道得太多了（程度已近於人狗難分），所以人可以調弄狗，或是狗在調弄人，彼此都能相安無事，相處融洽；但牠是熊貓，是希有的動物，難以服侍，也極其自然的了。</p>
<p>四川汶川到底有多少熊貓，誰也不知道，但誰都知道其少幾乎少到沒有的程度，那麼死了一隻，自然就少一隻了。看情形，這種動物大槪不識抬舉，人們在千方百計不惜頭破血流地想出洋鍍金，見見外國世面，好回來從杜魯門的褲子吹到好萊塢女明星的眼睫毛，而牠不是中途夭折，便是無福安居（聯合小姐），豈非無福而何？</p>
<h3 id="c197">智者說夢 <a href="#c197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>— 彬之</p>
<p>我雖不是癡人，却也要來談一談夢。</p>
<p>夢是什麼？一般人都迷信夢是一種預兆，我國古代早有那「維熊維羆，男子之祥，維虺維蛇，女子之兆」的話。可是總覺得有些穿鑿附會。心理學家弗洛伊特曾寫過「釋夢」一書，但其理論也很奇特，許多人總對他的主張有點懷疑。</p>
<p>「日有所思夜有所夢」確是夢的起因。腦海中的思潮，神經細胞的活動往往會因而起夢。例如一個學生在考試前幾天，夢着他在考試塲內應考時的情景。睡眠中受了外界的刺激，也會使夢發生。聽到了鬧鐘的聲音，會夢聞雷響，手上觸着濕的東西，會夢遇下兩。在心理學上，前者稱爲「思夢」後者稱爲「感夢，」感夢雖然是受外界的刺激所引起，但不是和過去的經驗沒有關係，僅比思夢少些罷了。</p>
<p>夢中發生的現象，和你過去的經騐多少有一點關係。有時的夢境會覺得很新奇。這不是和你過去的經騐無關，僅是記憶得不充分而已。或者你雖未曾親身經歷過，但在你腦海中，至少已有一個想像，這想像也是心靈上的一種活動。</p>
<p>胡思亂想</p>
<p>在白天清醒的時候，不會語無倫次的講話，也不會有輕舉妄動的行動，因爲社會環境的拘束，你自已會控制自已，雖然有時你會胡思亂想，但並不會向外流露出來。這種有秩序的理智行爲，心理學上叫做意識作用。睡眠的時候身體上一切都休息了，可是腦神經的活動，並沒有停止。許多白天受限制的思想和行動，這時會在腦海中一層一層地湧上來，因爲這時的意識活動是停止了，神經細胞可以毫無拘束的活動。夢就在這樣的情景下產生的。所以在夢中，能充分表現各人的性格。</p>
<p>夢爲何能成爲一種預兆呢？有人在夢中生病，不久果然病了。這是和身體上生理變化有關的，因爲疾病的發生，常有一種徵象預先潛伏在身體裏，在日間忙忙碌碌，對於這潛伏的病徵不及細察，但在睡眠時會表現出來。有許多行爲也是這樣，在心靈上有一種活動的傾向，而自已未曾覺得，睡眠中却活動了。</p>
<p>黃粱夢覺</p>
<p>有一本「枕中記」的傳奇，記盧生在逆旅中遇到呂洞賓，借了呂仙的枕頭睡覺，夢中過了半世榮華富貴的生活，待一覺醒來，呂仙煮的黃梁飯還未熟過。這故事裏說夢中數十年的生活，還不到燒一餐飯的時間，是不是太不合理罷。不，夢中的時間確是很短促的。心理學家的研究，簡單的夢，不會上一分鐘，複雜的也僅二三分鐘，五分鐘的夢已經是很長了。做夢的時間，是在睡覺未醒前的幾分鏟。</p>
<p>夢中的景象，在醒來以後，你能完全的記着麽？世界上決沒有這樣的人。因爲睡眠時大腦停止了活動，所以不容易將夢中遇見的事，很牢固的保持下來。在初醒的時候，也有些可以記得一點，但也僅是極少的一部份，不久，這記得的也會很快的忘却。除非在朦朧半睡的時候，能够記得更淸楚些，然而決不會全都記得。</p>

<p>毘明住了一位洋先生，學會了幾句洋涇浜華語，時常賣弄。</p>
<p>有一次，他的一個中國朋友，在軍隊裏當隊長的，從前綫回來了。洋先生設宴歡迎。</p>
<p>酒至半酣，洋先生站起來用華語演講，說：「今天，我很高興，因爲，我好久不見的姘頭，回來了…」賓客哄堂大笑，隊長朋友面紅耳赤。査問淸楚，才知道洋先生把隊長Captain）譯成「兵頭」，把兵頭念成「姘頭」，於是使隊長朋友窘得無地自容。</p>
<p>洋先生知道把酒喝乾呌「乾杯」，隨意飲酌呌「隨便」，於是他拿了酒杯站起來，正要開口，却忘記了「隨便」一詞，只記得一個便字，苦思半刻，忽然想起了，便大聲對大家說：「諸位，我們大家小便小便」！</p>
<p>酒喝完了，飯吃過了，洋先生吩咐僕人說：「把我今天買的褲子拿來」。僕人把一條新褲子拿來了，洋先生急得連忙揮手說：「不是不是！是褲子，要用盆子裝的，是褲子」！繼了半天，才知道洋先生要的是飯後吃的果子！</p>

<p>— 鈍父</p>
<p>參議會是唯一代表民意的機構，參議員是代表着社會各階層的民衆。單就本市的參議員中：有敎師，有記者，有律師，會計師，醫生，還有女工……可算得「包羅萬象，各式俱全。」最近有朋友從杭州來，却帶來了一個更令人興奮的消息，杭州市的參議員中，有一個竟是「現任職」的人力車夫！</p>
<p>那位參議員的姓名是趙廷秀，紹興人，拉人力車爲生。當他穿着破破爛爛的衣服，拉着車子沿街兜生意時，誰會料到他竟是赫赫參議員呢？</p>
<p>而這位趙先生放下了車槓，又照樣搖搖擺擺的謁見省長市長，出席會議，忙個不了。他依然是穿着這套污舊不堪的衣服，因此在謁見要人時，每次總被門巡叱喝：「滾開！」等他慢條斯理的掏出了名片，門巡見到了這赫然「杭州市參議員」的銜頭，不禁呆上個半天，然後放他進去。</p>
<p>一位美國記者在杭州，給他探悉了這件事，如獲珍寶，趕忙拍電報回國去，大事宣揚。杭州的報上，也競相刋登道位參議員的照相。</p>
<p>朋友的話到這裏完了。我深深的感到：這不只是一個茶餘酒後的談助資料，並且確是中國實行民主的好兆。因爲：</p>
<p>參議員本來是代表社會各個階層的民衆，勞動大眾自然也享有同樣的公民權利！</p>
<p>民主佳兆</p>

<p>編者按：本刋於八月廿二日刋登「你有下列的慾望嗎？」一文，述及人生的最高目標：（一）獲致巨量金錢；（二）揚名社會而受羣眾的尊敬；（三）在某種事業和工作上爭取最高的成就而成名；（四）希望過一種樸實單純而愉快安定的生活，旣不求名，也不圖利；（五）服務社會，增進同胞福利；（六）不知道</p>
<p>續者們對此深感興趣，紛就上述的目標中，各抒所懷，大多希望過安定樸實的生活，有的則謂人生的目標簡直不知道。茲特將這些動亂中的一部份人們人生觀，略爲摘載於次：</p>
<h3 id="c203">宇宙的永恒 <a href="#c203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>— 杜秋原</p>
<p>我以爲人生最高目標，是過着一種單純而愉快安定的生活。旣不求名，也不圖利，恬靜地享受現實的人生；而欣賞着宇宙的永恒。</p>
<p>由生物的觀點來看，人不過是動物之一，和鳥獸虫魚一樣；僅僅是生存在地殼上的一種生物而已！既不是爲名利而生，亦不是爲金錢而生，也沒有標明爲「工作」而生，老實說只是求生存而已矣！</p>
<p>誇大的人，忘記了自然的偉大，宇宙的永恒；同時也忘記了自己的渺小。</p>
<h3 id="c204">清適的鄉居 <a href="#c204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>— 史珮</p>
<p>在目前的情况下，我不願走上政治舞台，因爲也許我會因金錢的誘惑而迷住了眼睛，去做一名爲大衆唾罵怨恨的貪官；我也不願置身於巨商之林，怕的是我或許會用着巧妙的手段利用我優越的地位，神不知鬼不覺地賺上一大筆違反良心的錢財，再公開地捐去其中千百份之一去換一個慈善家的假面具！我詆希望能在小的都會或鄕村裏做一名中學或小學敎師，成天和那一班天眞可愛未經世俗的孩子們在一塊。我要盡我的力量去敎導他們，使他們一個個都成爲良善有用的好公民！我想住兩間節整的屋子，空閒的時候在田野中散散步或釣釣魚，拿一些可以維持得下生活的費用，讀讀心愛的書籍，寫寫心裏要說的東西，不求名，更不求利，就這樣平平穩穩過一種樸實單純而快樂安定的生活！</p>
<h3 id="c205">簡直不知道 <a href="#c205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>— 靖華</p>
<p>我的人生最高目標究竟是那一項一，獲致巨量的金錢：</p>
<p>我不願自己爲了金錢犯罪，也不願人家爲了我的金錢而犯罪，所以我不希望獲得巨量的金錢！</p>
<p>二，揚名社會而受羣眾的尊敬：</p>
<p>我要做一個自由自在的人，所以也不希望揚名社會。</p>
<p>三，在某種事業和工作上爭取最高的成就而成名：</p>
<p>一個人能在一種事業和工作上得到最高的成就而成名，這是不朽的，是值得誇耀的，也是够人羨慕的，然而像我這樣一個，先天旣沒有特殊的賦與，後天又處於這樣一個「吃不飽，餓不死」的環境之中，而要想在事業和工作上爭取最高的成就，這，眞是叫我從何做起呢？</p>
<p>四，希望過一種樸實單純而愉快安定的生活，旣不求名，也不圖利：</p>
<p>關於這一項，愉快安定的生活，是我所需要的，名利雖在所不求，但我却不甘將我所有的生命去交給樸實單純，並且我相信在我的生命中，假使有一述串的樸實單純也決產生不了愉快，所以我的目標也不是這一項。</p>
<p>五，服務社會增進同胞的福利；這，當我良知發現的時候，我常這樣想，偶然我也會「激於義憤」的做幾件類似的事，然而這良知是一剎那的，須臾便會消滅的，所以我只能當它是我生命中的插曲，而不能算是我的目標。</p>
<p>六，不知道：的確，我的回答只好是不知道，時代在遷移着，環境在變更着，未來的，誰又能把握得住呢？有了希望到那時變成失望，這是多麽的難堪？那末，不如幹着再說吧！</p>
<h3 id="c206">唯一的野心 <a href="#c206" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e206" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">206</a></h3>
<p>— 高睡知</p>
<p>我不願歸入什麼派，也不願屬於什麽黨；屹站在「人」的立場上，爲人類求取安康！</p>
<p>我不信仰什麼宗教，也不祟拜什麽偶像；本着「人該愛人」的眞理，傾這短促的人生去做！</p>
<p>我沒有權成上的野心，也沒有名利間的慾望；「凡人都該獲得生之安與生之樂」</p>
<p>即是我惟一的野心—慾望—信仰！</p>

<h3 id="e1">A Major Development in the Peace Negotiation Situation: Zhou Enlai and Others to Return to Beijing Tomorrow Morning to Continue Negotiations on Ceasefire Issues <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>

<p>[Report from this newspaper] Government representatives Wu Tiecheng, Shao Lizi, and Lei Zhen arrived in Shanghai by special plane a few days ago to invite representatives from the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and the Third Force to go to Beijing to continue the talks that had been interrupted for several months. After two days of continuous efforts, their mission has been successfully completed. Leaders of the CCP and the Third Force, amidst thunderous cheers yesterday, decided to fly to Beijing by government special plane tomorrow morning. Of the three government representatives, Lei Zhen has already returned to Beijing due to official business. Wu and Shao also returned to Beijing last night.</p>
<p>The atmosphere yesterday was even more harmonious. Although the talks did not formally involve specific issues, all the participating representatives were extremely optimistic. They deeply felt that the ceasefire, which the compatriots of the whole country sincerely long for day and night, has moved a step closer due to the discussions of the past few days.</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, the representatives did not have a joint meeting, only exchanged views individually. At noon, the Youth Party hosted a banquet for all the representatives. At 4 PM, the Democratic Socialist Party held a tea party at its headquarters on Yuyuan Road. At 7 PM, the CCP hosted a banquet for all the representatives at Zhou's residence on Sinan Road. Formal exchange of views took place from 5 PM to 7 PM at Wang Ying's residence on Haige Road.</p>
<p>All the representatives were in very high spirits, and the atmosphere was full of peace and harmony as they toasted each other. Participants in the talks included Wu Tiecheng, Shao Lizi, Zhou Enlai, Li Weihan, Chen Jiakang, Zhang Junmai, Xu Fulin, Zeng Qi, Hu Zhengzhi, Li Huang, Chen Qitian, Zuo Shunsheng, Yang Yongjun, Yu Jiaju, Guo Moruo, Luo Longji, Shen Junru, Huang Yanpei, Zhang Bojun, Jiang Yuntian, and others.</p>
<p>At the tea party of the Democratic Socialist Party, Zhang Junmai first invited Xu Fulin, one of the founders of the party and a founding hero, to give a speech. Xu said that he hoped the government would broaden its perspective and make concessions for the sake of the entire country and the entire nation. He also hoped that the CCP would make concessions for the sake of the entire country and all compatriots. The Third Force is willing to do its best to promote the success of peace talks so that a new China can be created.</p>
<p>Wu Tiecheng then gave a speech, stating that the government's desire for peaceful unification is as urgent as that of all parties in opposition. Therefore, the government sincerely urges all parties and social elites, as well as representatives of the Political Consultative Conference (PCC), to go to Beijing as soon as possible to resume peace talks, striving for the success of the talks and the realization of peace. He also hoped that all the virtuous people in opposition would become "in power," jointly taking responsibility, not only solving all the problems of the country but also jointly planning the construction of the country. He and Mr. Shao Lizi, representing the government and the PCC representatives, have come to invite all of you to Beijing to listen to your insightful opinions and ask for your guidance. We sincerely hope that you will go to Beijing. Our mission in Shanghai today can be said to have come to an end. If you cannot go to Nanjing together today or tomorrow, we also hope that you will make the trip as soon as possible. We will look forward to your arrival to discuss national affairs together. This is not only the hope of the government but also the hope of the people of the whole country.</p>
<h3 id="e2">Negotiation Door Opened: Deeply Hope to Achieve Peace: Zhou Enlai's Speech at the Tea Party <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Zhou Enlai then gave a speech upon invitation, stating briefly: He was not only excited but also more gratified by Mr. Xu's instructions. It is not easy for us to gather together. When the PCC opened in the past, the whole country rejoiced and cheered for its success, and the PCC finally succeeded. Unfortunately, twists and turns occurred afterward, and the PCC could not be reopened, resulting in all parties, factions, and social elites having to leave Beijing again in disappointment after arriving. Now that the peace talks have been suspended for five months, thanks to the efforts of the Third Force and the arrival of government representatives in Shanghai, we can finally meet and talk again. Informal negotiations have now begun. The door to negotiation has been opened, and we deeply hope to achieve peace, democracy, independence, and unity. All these have been stipulated in the PCC, and now we only seek their realization, especially peace, which is the ceasefire, as the most important. This is what the people of the whole country urgently demand. We are willing to follow Mr. Xu's instructions and strive to achieve our goals.</p>
<h3 id="e3">Zeng Qi Hopes to Stop the Flames of War <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>Next, Zeng Qi gave a speech, saying: Today is the first grand gathering since the closing of the Chongqing PCC, which is extremely gratifying. Today's meeting is a symbol of national unity, which shows that the future is promising. The current dispute lies in the lack of cessation of the flames of war. The Third Force is a political party without guns. Today, the government and the CCP have gradually attached importance to the opinions of the Third Force. Because "if you do not respect the person, you will not respect their words," you must "respect the person and respect their party" in order to "respect their words." The Third Force feels both happy and fearful: happy that there is room for their opinions to be adopted, which can turn hostility into friendship; fearful that their ability is weak and they may not succeed. He believes that if both sides can sincerely respect the Third Force, then the Third Force will be able to maintain its impartial spirit and work hard from the standpoint of a truly third party. However, as the Doctrine of the Mean says, "You can tread on a bare blade, but you cannot practice the Doctrine of the Mean." The third party may still inevitably be scolded. This is his feeling today. He has known Mr. Zhang Junmai since 1919, nearly thirty years ago, and he hopes to make the greatest efforts together in the future to stop the flames of war and promote peace.</p>
<h3 id="e4">Zhang Junmai Speaks, Calling Himself a Younger Brother <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>After that, Zhang Junmai invited Luo Longji and Shen Junru to speak, who both declined humbly, saying that the China Democratic League (CDL) and the Democratic Socialist Party are one family. Zhang then gave a speech, saying: "Today, it is an honor that the Kuomintang (KMT), the CCP, other parties, social elites, and virtuous people are willing to come and gather together. The Democratic Socialist Party is the 'younger brother' among the various political parties and is not yet a full year old. Today, it seems to have grown up. Since 1924, the history of China has been the history of the KMT and the CCP. The period from 1924 until the Japanese surrender can be called the darkest period in Chinese history. Today's gathering is truly rare after thirteen years. The 'younger brother' is willing to follow the 'older brothers' and hopes to make practical contributions to achieving democracy, unification, and nation-building." After the speech, there was thunderous applause. Wu Tiecheng stepped forward, raised his glass, and said that the guests should congratulate the members of the Democratic Socialist Party! Everyone happily raised their glasses. Wu then said with a smile: Although the Democratic Socialist Party has been born for less than a year, it has extremely sufficient innate qualities! The whole room was filled with joy.</p>
<h3 id="e5">If an Agreement is Reached in the Negotiations in Beijing, a Ceasefire Order Can Be Issued Immediately <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper, Nanjing, 19th] The evolution of the current situation has taken a major turn for the better tonight. Due to the government's concessions, the opinions of both sides are converging. CCP representative Zhou Enlai and other representatives of various parties can be welcomed back to Nanjing by a special plane sent by the government on the 21st to reopen negotiations. The ceasefire issue can be discussed and resolved immediately in the Military Three-Person Group meeting. Because both sides sincerely agree to a ceasefire, the ceasefire order can also be issued immediately. This news was obtained by the reporter from a conversation with PCC representative Sun Ke at around 8 PM tonight. Sun told the reporter with an extremely optimistic attitude that the situation has indeed undergone a major change. All issues will be discussed when they come to Beijing. The CCP has agreed to the opinions put forward by the government and has agreed to return to Beijing immediately, which means that it no longer insists on the two opinions of the Yan'an side. They will return to Beijing on the 21st. If a meeting is held on that day, an agreement can be reached on that day, and a ceasefire order can be issued immediately. The "Three" and "Five" meetings can also be convened, and the Constitutional Draft Review Committee will also be held. As for the issue of the National Assembly representatives and the number of CCP representatives, it needs to be decided in the Comprehensive Group.</p>

<h3 id="e6">Representatives Wu and Shao Advance to Beijing Last Night <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>The reporter was extremely anxious because the situation was unpredictable. At 6:30 PM, suddenly hearing enthusiastic applause followed by laughter, the reporter felt relieved. At 7 PM, all reporters were invited into the meeting room. Luo Longji, representing the entire group, made a statement, saying: The informal negotiations were held again today and were even more harmonious than yesterday. The peace talks have taken another step forward. It has now been decided to continue the informal negotiations in Beijing first. The government representatives will advance to Beijing tonight, and all representatives of the Third Force and the CCP will advance to Beijing by government special plane the day after tomorrow (the 21st) morning to continue the informal negotiations of the past two days.</p>
<p>Shao Lizi said that the current talks are the first part of "talk, stop, talk," which is "talk." Luo Longji added: The people advancing to Beijing on the 21st include all parties, factions, social elites, and virtuous people who participated in the talks in the past two days, not limited to PCC representatives.</p>
<h3 id="e7">The CCP's Banquet Overflowed with Laughter <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>Chen Jiakang, when answering reporters' inquiries, also revealed that what the government is asking for is to maintain the status quo, and what the CCP is asking for is to respect the agreements. All the representatives then went to Zhou's residence on Sinan Road to attend the CCP's banquet. The guests and hosts enjoyed themselves to the fullest, and the atmosphere was overflowing with laughter. After Wu and Shao left Shanghai, the reporter also interviewed several representatives of the Third Force late at night to inquire about their opinions on the prospects of the peace talks. All the representatives unanimously expressed optimism, believing that even if there is a distance between the opinions of the two sides, the war is bound to be stopped because a ceasefire is not only the common demand of the people of the whole of China, but also the desire of people all over the world.</p>
<h3 id="e8">Lei Zhen Returns to Beijing to Report to the Chairman <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper, Nanjing, 19th] PCC Secretary-General Lei Zhen returned to Beijing by night train on the 18th and arrived at 7:15 AM on the 19th. At 9:30 AM, he attended the report in the meeting at President Sun Ke's private residence. Attendees included Zhang Lisheng, Wang Shijie, Chen Bulei, Chen Lifu, Wu Dingchang, Sun Ke, and Lei Zhen. Lei reported the contacts in Shanghai for the past two days, especially explaining the meaning of the word "agree" in Chairman Chiang's statement, "Once the CCP agrees" and "After the CCP agrees to the above points." Sun said that agreement and understanding are actually the same thing and have the same meaning. If the CCP can understand this opinion, then negotiations can begin. Lei reported in great detail, lasting an hour. Then, the representatives expressed their opinions, all hoping that the representatives of the various parties could return to Beijing immediately and convene the Three-Person Group and the informal Five-Person Group meetings separately in accordance with the Chairman's eight-point guideline for resolving the current situation. Then, the ceasefire order could be issued. After the meeting, Chen Bulei and Lei Zhen went to see the Chairman at noon to report everything. In the afternoon, Lei informed Shanghai of this opinion by long-distance telephone. It is said that the meeting in Shanghai at 4 PM today was based on this opinion and discussed it. As a result, both sides reached an understanding and it was heard that they had decided to return to Beijing on Monday. PCC government representatives Wu Tiecheng and Shao Lizi are scheduled to return to Beijing by night train on the 19th and will arrive on the morning of the 20th. In addition, Liang Shuming of the CDL visited Lei Zhen at 7 PM and talked for an hour.</p>

<p>Yesterday, when the photographers from the Central Photography Studio were planning their work at Wang Lu, everyone said that there must be a shot of Wu Tiecheng and Zhou Enlai shaking hands. When the filming officially began, Secretary-General Wu said: "Please ask Mr. Zhou to stand in the middle, and Mr. Shao and I will stand on the side. Wouldn't it be better if we stood a little closer?" However, the reporters standing behind the photographers unanimously shouted from the bottom of their hearts: "Please shake hands! Shake hands!" Wu immediately smiled and extended his hand to Zhou Enlai. Zhou readily grasped it tightly. The sound of the camera rang, leaving behind this unforgettable scene!</p>
<p>When explaining "stop talking," "talk stop talk," and "talk stop," a certain representative smiled and said to the reporters: "We are interpreting for you. You have to deduct a portion of this month's salary for us." The venues for the talks these days are one at Fan Garden on Haige Road (the residence of Xu Zhimo's wife, Zhang Junmai's younger sister) and one at Wu Tiecheng's Wang Lu residence on Haige Road. Some reporters said that the talks would surely succeed because "Wang Lu" means there is hope, and "Fan Garden" means there is a range.</p>
<p>When the Democratic Socialist Party held a tea party on Yuyuan Road, the reporters said: "We are the fourth force." As a result, the "fourth force" was also treated with tea and refreshments. Zhang Junmai was in particularly high spirits. He said: "I want to take a photo with Mr. Wu and Mr. Shao," and "I want to take a photo with Mr. Zhou." He took one photo after another. No one had ever seen Mr. Zhang so happy.</p>
<p>Shao Lizi has been working hard for days, and he felt slightly unwell during the talks yesterday. There was a chorus of "Buy Tiger Balm!" in Wang Lu. Luo Longji said that Mr. Shao was dozing off while attending the meeting, but in fact, it was for the sake of the country. The elderly Mr. Shao is really tired. His loyalty to the country and his achievements are no less than those of the anti-Japanese soldiers. Secretary-General Wu's Wang Lu residence is the center for reporters to gather news during the "January 28th Incident" fourteen years ago. It is magnificent, elegant, and exquisitely decorated. The small living room where Wu met with reporters during his tenure as the Mayor of Shanghai is also the place where he met with reporters these two days. Even the photos on display are still the same as they were back then. The world has changed drastically in the past fourteen years, but the scenery in this small living room is still the same as it was back then!</p>
<p>The most tense moment the day before yesterday was at 4 or 5 PM when the terms of the Yan'an statement were suddenly heard at Zhou's residence. The most tense moment yesterday was also at 5 PM when the representatives closed the doors at Wang Lu to discuss matters. Perhaps Chinese history was at two of its most critical turning points at that time. When the reporters entered the conference room at 7 PM to hear the official announcement of the news, they hurriedly asked the representatives if the news was good. Huang Yanpei said: "It's good news." Shao Li also said, "Very good news." Zhou Enlai said with a smile: "Ask them, ask them!"</p>

<h3 id="e16">Years of Destruction Since the Republic: Revolution Should Focus on Construction: Ambassador Stuart Encourages Students in Hangzhou in His Speech <a href="#e16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper, Hangzhou, 19th] This morning, Ambassador Stuart, guided by Mayor Zhou and Wang Kui-sheng, visited his former residence on Tianhan Zhou Bridge in the city. This place is the earliest Jesus Church in Hangzhou, built by his father in the twelfth year of the Tongzhi reign of the Qing Dynasty. Ambassador Stuart was born here in 1876, spending his happy childhood. At the age of eleven, he went abroad to study. After completing his studies, he returned to Hangzhou with his newly married wife at the end of 1904 and also lived here. Therefore, Ambassador Stuart has a particularly close feeling for Hangzhou and expressed that he felt it a great honor to be able to speak a few words of Hangzhou dialect. Ambassador Stuart lingered in the room where he was born for a long time. At this time, the breeze was gentle, and the autumn sun was pleasant. Ambassador Stuart nodded with a smile, as if recalling his childhood dreams. The atmosphere in the room was peaceful. Seventy-one years ago, this messenger of peace for China was born here, with the enthusiasm of a missionary, willing to benefit the Chinese people for life. Now, the situation in the country is at a critical turning point. Visiting here has great significance. The tree planted by Ambassador Stuart in his childhood now covers the house, and the seeds of peace he is sowing now will surely have satisfactory achievements in the future.</p>
<p>Ambassador Stuart stayed at his former residence for half an hour and then took a short rest at the guest house before taking a car to Zhijiang University. Director Shen of the Municipal Public Affairs Bureau led the way, and Mayor Zhou and others accompanied him. President Li Peien warmly welcomed him. At 11:30 AM, he gave a speech at the school's Duke Hall. More than 700 teachers and students from the entire school went to listen. When Ambassador Stuart entered, everyone stood up automatically, and the applause was thunderous. After President Li gave a brief welcome speech, Ambassador Stuart began his speech in soft Chinese, stating briefly: With decades of educational experience, he deeply felt the great power of Chinese students. The Chinese student movement is a great miracle seen only in history. China's patriotic movements are all due to the power of Chinese students, such as the May Fourth Movement. This spirit will never be forgotten by me. In the past anti-Japanese war, it showed the spirit, will, unity, and organizational power of Chinese students. I deeply hope that this power will continue to be exerted to promote the realization of a peaceful, unified, and strong China, with freedom of thought, speech, religion, belief, and discussion of national affairs, so that the Republic of China can be named and actualized. Although there are many corrupt officials now, the blame should be placed on the people, not on the government. This is the way to reform the Republic of China. Since the establishment of the Republic of China, there has been destruction every year. From now on, we should focus on construction. Therefore, this revolution should also be a revolution of construction, not a revolution of destruction. Finally, he hoped that Chinese youth would all have religious beliefs, which could enhance their patriotism and their enthusiasm for serving society and the people.</p>

<p>At 12:00 noon, more than 200 representatives from people's organizations in Zhejiang Province held a banquet for Ambassador Stuart at the Dahua Hotel on the shore of West Lake. The Special Envoy arrived at the meeting after delivering a speech at Zhejiang University. Those present greeted him with warm applause and immediately took their seats. Li Pei'en, President of Zhejiang University, chaired the event and delivered a welcome speech, the gist of which was: Mr. Stuart was born in Hangzhou and should be regarded as a Chinese citizen under American law. Therefore, we should regard him as a fellow villager. We are delighted that our fellow villager has come home from afar. Ambassador Stuart was originally an educator, but was invited by the American government to serve as ambassador. This is a great honor for our village. Since taking office, Ambassador Stuart has worked tirelessly to seek peace for our country. All of this deserves our warm welcome. After Mr. Li finished speaking, he translated his words into English. Amidst applause, the Special Envoy stood up and delivered a speech in Hangzhou dialect, expressing his gratitude and saying that he dared not accept all the slogans in the hall, except for the one that said "Hangzhou is my second hometown," which he felt he deserved. He recalled fondly his childhood days wandering between the north and south hills of West Lake and the Lingyin Temple, finding great joy. He was very pleased to see that the lake and mountains were still in good condition. He hoped that everyone, under the leadership of Chairman Shen, would build a new Zhejiang and strive to build modern enterprises under the spirit of science and academia. He knew that Zhejiang's silk, tea, and Zhang Xiaoquan's scissors were all famous, and if they could be improved, their future would be limitless. Later, veteran diplomat Qian Shiqing recited the opinions of Zhejiang's people's organizations, the main points of which were: (1) seek internal political reform; (2) the unreasonable disturbances of the Communist Party should be effectively sanctioned; (3) Chairman Chiang's eight key points should be sincerely supported; (4) the convening of the National Assembly should not be delayed any further, and all parties should submit their lists of candidates as soon as possible; (5) the Communist Party should accept the Five-Man and Three-Man meetings and hold them quickly; (6) our two countries have always maintained friendly relations, and the anti-American movement does not represent the will of the entire people. After Chen Xisu, Principal of Hongdao Girls' High School, translated it into English, Chairman Shen Honglie delivered a speech, praising the grand occasion with democracy, freedom, unity, and peace. Then, students from Zhejiang University, including Ms. Mao Min, presented local products from major Zhejiang manufacturers. Stuart stood up again to express his gratitude, and then the luncheon began. They toasted each other several times, and the event ended happily at 3:00 p.m.</p>
<p>Special Envoy Speaks Earnestly: China Needs Unity and Peace, Starting with Education and Character</p>
<p>At 4:00 p.m., Ambassador Stuart attended the reopening ceremony of the YMCA. The auditorium on the fourth floor of the YMCA was packed. After the meeting was opened with fireworks and the rituals were performed, Lei Fazhang, President of the YMCA, reported on the establishment of the World YMCA and the history of the Chinese YMCA and the Hangzhou YMCA. Then, Ambassador Stuart delivered a speech in Chinese, saying that the Hangzhou YMCA was his first friend, and Wang Kui, the current General Secretary of the Hangzhou YMCA, was his old colleague. He was born in Hangzhou, so he loved China. China needed unity, independence, and peace to complete a strong nation, which should start with education and character, with love, honesty, unity, service, faith, and a spirit of sacrifice. Ambassador Stuart spoke earnestly, and the audience was moved. Then, Chairman Shen delivered a speech, saying that the YMCA was Christian, and the Christian doctrine was about cultivating the Way, and the Way was about love. Schools in Zhejiang Province paid attention to intellectual education but neglected physical education, especially moral and social education. The YMCA emphasized the equal importance of intellectual, physical, moral, and social education. He hoped to cooperate with people in the education field in the future to inspire young people to move forward. Finally, Liang Xiaochu, General Secretary of the National YMCA Association, delivered a speech, and Wang Kui, General Secretary of the Hangzhou YMCA, reported on the YMCA's development trends. They sang hymns and offered blessings. After the meeting, a ceremony was held to welcome Ambassador Stuart as an honorary citizen. Mayor Zhou Xiangxian presided over the ceremony and led the rituals, and then delivered a speech. Zhang Qiang, Speaker of the Provincial Assembly, and Zhang Heng, Speaker of the Municipal Assembly, also delivered speeches. Ambassador Stuart responded, and the ceremony concluded. In the evening, Ambassador Stuart went to the YWCA to listen to music. He was scheduled to preside over his father's Hushan Hall service at the church on the morning of the 20th and tour Hushan in the afternoon.</p>

<p>[Our newspaper, Hangzhou, 19th] After Ambassador Stuart arrived in Hangzhou, Mayor Zhou and his wife held a banquet at the foreign guest reception center at noon on the 18th. In the evening, they went to the provincial government to attend a joint banquet hosted by the provincial government, the provincial party headquarters, and the youth league branch headquarters. More than 40 leaders from all sectors of the party and government and social celebrities attended. During the banquet, Chairman Shen delivered a welcome speech, saying: "Tonight, we are welcoming not an ordinary envoy, but our old fellow villager. During the eight years of the War of Resistance Against Japan, our country suffered heavy losses. Mr. Stuart has returned to his long-separated homeland and sees that the lake and mountains are still the same. The Hongdao Girls' School, founded by his mother, is thriving, and the graves of his parents are intact. This should be a great comfort to the Ambassador. The Ambassador was detained by the Japanese army for a long time, and now, at the age of 70, he is working for peace and is still in good health, which makes us even happier. I hope the Ambassador will stay in Hangzhou for a few more days, enjoy the lake and mountains, and I hope the Ambassador will live for another 70 years, continue his past spirit of compassion, and work hard for Sino-American friendship."</p>
<p>After Chairman Shen finished his speech, Secretary-General Lei translated it into English. Then, Ambassador Stuart replied in Hangzhou dialect, saying: "This time, I returned to Hangzhou to sweep the graves and tour West Lake. I grew up in Hangzhou and consider it my second hometown. I have been away from Hangzhou for many years, and I am very pleased to return. I am very grateful for the warm reception. I hope that Sino-American relations will become closer and that we will strengthen cooperation to build a foundation for world peace." After he finished speaking, the whole audience burst into thunderous applause. The guests and hosts happily dispersed at 10:00 p.m.</p>

<h3 id="e22">Northeast, with Endless Coal Mines, Faces Extremely Severe Coal Shortage This Winter; Government Agencies Share Office Space, Enemy Property Houses Unoccupied <a href="#e22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Changchun, 19th] The Northeast, known worldwide for its endless forests and coal mines, is experiencing a severe coal shortage this winter. It is already late autumn, and the leaves are falling, but the city's eagerly awaited winter heating essential, coal, is still nowhere to be found. The black market coal price has already risen to 14,000 or 15,000 yuan per ton in circulating currency, but this is not enough to induce coal merchants to transport large quantities of it, because under the circumstances of a lack of transportation and strict control over coal production and sales, they are actually powerless. After the Japanese residents here were successively repatriated, the Japanese-style houses in the new urban area, full of flowers and plants, are almost entirely vacant. Although these exquisite and skillfully constructed buildings have all been received or registered for use, very few people have actually moved in. The reason is that there is a lack of coal for heating. In order to save coal, the employees and families of various agencies in the city are scrambling to live together, and some agencies with different affiliations are also agreeing to share office space in order to get through the harsh winter together. Recently, the Maritime Building, which was renovated by the Economic Commission of the Northeast Headquarters, is about to become a public winter shelter for agencies related to the economic sector. The building is large in scale, surpassing the Manchurian Coal Building previously occupied by the Northeast Headquarters. It has now been agreed that the Changchun Branch of the Northeast Unified Receiving Committee, the Food Administration, the Economic Affairs Office of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, and the Real Estate Bureau will live together. In addition, the building has spare rooms that can accommodate 300 to 400 people for office work. Those who wish to borrow the rooms are invited to do so. The borrowing agencies do not have to pay rent and only need to share the coal costs and public utilities fees for the winter. This is a great irony to those in Beijing and Shanghai who are propping up houses with gold bars.</p>

In order to understand the actual situation of the entire line, the Pinghan Railway Bureau has formed an inspection team to go north for inspection on the morning of the 19th, in order to start repair work. In addition, the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) has ordered the Hankou Materials Storage and Transportation Bureau to allocate 500 tons of food rice to subsidize the repair project of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway from Nanchang to Zhuzhou, as a means of providing work relief.</p>

<h3 id="e24">A Smooth Path for Developing International Trade <a href="#e24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>In order to restore the freedom of international trade after the war, the United States Department of State issued a white paper proposing a plan to develop international trade and raise employment levels in various countries, and suggested that various countries hold an international trade and employment conference to pass the "World Trade Charter" at the conference and organize an "International Trade Organization." The United Nations Social and Economic Council invited representatives from 19 countries, including China, the United States, Britain, and France, to hold a preparatory meeting in London starting on the 15th of this month to prepare for the procedures and agenda of the international trade conference. Except for the Soviet Union, all the world's major powers have representatives participating. The direction of world trade after the war is closely related to the success of this preparatory meeting and deserves our attention.</p>
<p>The nature of this preparatory meeting is roughly the same as the previously convened Bretton Woods International Monetary Fund Conference, which focuses on discussing the plan proposed by the United States. As for the content of the American plan, we have not yet seen the white paper issued by the State Department, so it is difficult to speculate; but according to a London dispatch from Agence France-Presse on the 17th, American representative Wilcox stated at the preparatory meeting that he proposed five principles for reviving the world economy: (1) substantially reduce tariff barriers; (2) countries exchange goods with each other; (3) no discrimination should be given to various imported goods; (4) countries should maintain a high level of employment; (5) all countries are equal in the international market.</p>
<p>The representatives of the 18 countries participating in this preparatory meeting expressed their approval of the American proposal to varying degrees. In particular, China, according to the speech of my country's representative Jin Wensi at the meeting: "The Chinese government attaches great importance to the tasks assigned to this meeting; we must ensure that the post-war world can enjoy the fruits of victory and no longer suffer the pain of poverty; the Chinese government expresses its deep approval of the American initiative to convene a world trade and employment conference; therefore, the Chinese delegation is prepared to accept the charter proposed by the United States as a basis for discussion; but it still hopes that the representatives of all countries can put forward positive and specific suggestions so that the less developed countries can also complete their industrialization tasks as soon as possible." Other representatives from various countries also expressed their approval; making this meeting full of a pleasant and harmonious atmosphere, everyone felt that the future was bright and optimistic.</p>
<p>However, if we study the wishes of the United States in putting forward this plan and observe the actual situation in the world today, we deeply feel that there are still some difficulties in restoring the freedom of international trade after the war, which still require the efforts of American political diplomats. The focus of the American plan is to organize the United Nations International Trade Organization and implement economic cooperation, on the one hand, based on the principle of mutual benefit, so that all countries have the opportunity to freely develop their trade and economy; on the other hand, according to equal conditions, all countries have equal opportunities to obtain markets and raw materials. In a word, it is to realize the American wish, which is to restore the freedom of international trade and gradually lift the restrictions on trade for all countries. But can this wish be realized? At least today, it is still a very serious problem.</p>
<p>The first is that the non-participation of the Soviet Union and its bloc of countries in this meeting is enough to show that there are already two major groups in the world today in terms of economics; one is a socialist system, with the Soviet Union as the leader; the other is a capitalist system, with the United States as the center. These two major groups are as incompatible as fire and water, whether in ideology or in interests. In particular, the Soviet Union's heavy iron curtain in Eastern Europe makes it impossible for other countries to inquire. Therefore, the scope of the international trade freedom movement advocated by the United States can only be the scope of the so-called Anglo-American group at most. If the Soviet Union group does not participate in the development of international trade, it will not be of much significance.</p>
<p>The second is that the other countries after the war, especially Britain and France, suffered major losses during the war, and it is not easy to talk about recovery and prosperity after the war. Therefore, they have imposed various restrictions on foreign trade. Although the United States does not hesitate to lend huge sums of money to Britain and France to help them revive their economies, it cannot completely lift all restrictions on Britain and France for a while. As French representative Alphand stated at the meeting: "The two world wars have caused France to suffer major losses, and France will still need a considerable period of time to be able to abolish its restrictions on imported goods."</p>
<p>The third is that economically backward countries, whose industries have not yet been fully industrialized, cannot, in principle, oppose the freedom of international trade; but in order to develop their own industries, they cannot but adopt the so-called "moderate protection" measures. Because economically backward countries cannot stand on an equal footing with the United States at all. The principles of freedom, equality, mutual benefit, and mutual interest proclaimed by the American plan only benefit the United States, while industrially backward countries cannot enjoy its benefits. If this contradiction cannot be eliminated, the future of developing international trade is also not optimistic. Although the United States can benefit a lot under the principle of free international trade, it must also pay attention to the industrialization of economically backward countries. Indian representative Nehru expressed his opinion at the meeting, criticizing the American plan for failing to take into account the interests of economically underdeveloped countries. This sentence is worthy of deep thought by the American authorities.</p>
<p>The fourth is the problem of unemployment in various countries after the war. Now all countries are successively demobilizing, but after the scourge of this war, all countries are full of devastation, and it is difficult to talk about recovery. In particular, the employment problem of the people is even more difficult to solve. So how can we maintain a high level of employment in various countries? It is also a serious problem that requires the United States to come up with concrete solutions, and empty talk is of no practical help.</p>
<p>AUSTIN, the head of the American delegation to the United Nations General Assembly, declared on the 18th that the United States is willing to take the world's leadership position, abolish war, resolve international disputes by peaceful means, and improve the living standards of people in all countries of the world in terms of knowledge, spirit, and material, in order to eliminate the causes of war. Therefore, we hope that the United States should take a broad view of developing international trade, face reality, coordinate the interests of all parties, and jointly seek the recovery and prosperity of all countries in the world; it must not be selfish and consider only its own interests everywhere, and be regarded as an economic imperialist. The future of international trade is built on the economic prosperity of all countries in the world. If all countries in the world are poor, then the United States cannot enjoy prosperity alone.</p>

After receiving the instruction, I have reported to President Song and consulted on the solution.</p>

After hearing the sentence, Zhou smiled wryly and looked uneasy, sometimes pinching his nose and sometimes putting his hands in his sleeves. There was thunderous applause from the audience. When he was taken out of the court, the crowd shouted, "Shoot him! Shoot him!" After the bailiffs stopped them, Zhou Ni was immediately transferred from the detention center to the Laohuqiao Prison.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper Hangzhou Dispatch] The Zhejiang Provincial Government has recently reported that coastal and border counties of the province often export grain by sea, and neighboring provinces come to Zhejiang to purchase large quantities, causing grain prices to rise, affecting livelihood. In order to prevent smuggling and stabilize rice prices, it is specially stipulated that all grain exported by sea or to other provinces must first be telegraphed to the provincial government for transfer to the Ministry for approval before shipment is allowed. Merchants purchasing within the province should report to the Provincial Field and Grain Office for a purchase certificate, which shall be used for purchase and transportation. The Ministry of Grain has been notified for record, and various districts and counties have been notified to comply.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Hangzhou Dispatch, 19th] The Zhejiang Provincial Water Conservancy and Transportation Conference continued its meeting yesterday.

As for construction materials, national compulsory labor will be the main method, and the labor relief committees of various counties will plan and implement the work. In terms of water conservancy, it was resolved to implement eight flood control projects and twelve large-scale agricultural water conservancy projects.

<h3 id="e39">Commerce in Gaoyou Gradually Recovering Severe Shortage of Legal Tender and Extreme Difficulty in Getting Small Change Surplus of Rice and Grain but Scarcity of Daily Necessities <a href="#e39" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c39" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">39</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Zhenjiang Dispatch, 18th] According to a telephone message from Gaoyou: Since Gaoyou was occupied by the Communist army, although it was only for two months, countless people were brutally killed. Especially, the market was desolate, and the scene was so miserable that it seemed like another world compared with other restored areas. After the county government entered the city on the 8th of this month, County Magistrate Zhang Guanqiu led the county government personnel to inspect the entire city and personally consoled the victims, and the people were all grateful and wept bitterly. A military-civilian joint celebration was held in the Grand Auditorium a few days ago, and Gao Zifang (retired soldier) and Xia Datong (doctor over 60 years old) reported, in a sad and tearful tone, the horrors they had personally experienced and witnessed under the Communist rule, and the listeners were all heartbroken. In particular, Xia Datong read out two seven-character quatrains on the spot: "The people of the whole territory are overjoyed, the blue sky and white sun shine again, saving the people from fire and water, everyone respects the generals, and blesses the heavens with longevity. Mao Zedong harms the country and the people, falsely claiming democracy to deceive farmers and workers, carrying out looting and massacre, and sweeping away all public and private property in the territory." Those who heard it were even more moved. The houses in the city are quite neat, and there are not many traces of artillery fire left. This is the luck of the people of Gaoyou. The shops in the north and south gates have been tidied up and are resuming business. However, there is a severe shortage of legal tender in the streets, and it is extremely difficult to get small change. What is needed here is a large number of materials, such as matches, candles, dry batteries, cloth, and groceries. What is in surplus is rice, wheat, flour, and beans. You still don't believe it, but in Gaoyou, which produces crabs, it is not easy to eat crabs, because they are packed and sold at high prices in Zhenjiang and Shanghai. Now, the Gaoyou County Government is starting to check household registrations and reorganize the baojia system. The east and west gates of the city are closed at 7:00 PM, and the north and south gates are under curfew at 9:00 PM. At the same time, there are no electric lights here. The shops all use kerosene lamps and candles. There is no market at night, and the residents rest as soon as it gets dark. Who said that the people of Gaoyou have not been slaughtered? On the afternoon of October 7, more than a hundred young men were arrested by the Communist Party outside the north gate and shot to death with machine guns. This was because of the defeat of Shaobo on the 6th, and the Communist army frantically staged this bloody tragedy to vent their anger. In Gaoyou these days, I have seen many people carrying tables and chairs, which were the objects distributed to the poor by struggle. Now the people have automatically returned them, fearing disputes. After the Communist army withdrew from Shaobo, knowing that relying on force was not enough, they concentrated in Gaoyou and then fled one after another, and moved away a large amount of materials. Wang Wanfeng Sauce Garden outside the south gate was also robbed of many pickles. Fortunately, the National Army was stationed quickly and returned twenty large boats of pickles. On the side of Taishan Temple outside the north gate, there is Qinyou Terrace, which is still intact, with many steles and inscriptions by Su Dongpo. Gaoyou after the disaster will gradually move towards recovery. The reporter silently wishes him to grow up early and restore his original appearance.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper Zhenjiang Dispatch] According to Hong Qichen, Deputy Director of the Provincial Grain Office, in a conversation with reporters on the 17th: Among the 39 counties and cities in Jiangsu that collect grain tax in kind, five counties have already started collecting, including Jiangdu, Taixian, Yizheng, Gaochun, and Liuhe. The results are generally good. Gaochun has collected more than 20,000 dan, and Liuhe has collected more than 10,000 dan. As for the other counties that have not yet started collecting, they have requested an extension of the start date because the late rice has not yet fully ripened. According to the current situation, collection can be fully started by November 1 at the latest. At the same time, in order to strengthen the effectiveness of collection in kind, the office has dispatched personnel to important cities and towns in southern Jiangsu, such as Suzhou, Changzhou, Danyang, Kunshan, and Songjiang, to supervise and guide the work, in order to achieve twice the result with half the effort.</p>

<p>Elders Request Postponement of Grain Tax Collection</p>
<p>[Xian County Dispatch] Since the victory, the people of Shandong Province have been burdened with extremely heavy taxes. Eight or nine out of ten areas in the province are in the hands of the Communist army. Many local guerrilla teams are concentrated near the county towns along the railway lines, totaling more than 300,000 people, including their families, no less than one million. These troops have no salaries and generally collect supplies locally. According to statistics, the supplies provided to Xian County in one year have exceeded the collection and borrowing in kind by more than thirteen times. The situation in Anqiu and other counties is even worse than in Xian County, and the conscription of laborers and firewood and the construction of projects are beyond the capacity of the people, and many have abandoned their land and fled. This autumn, eastern Shandong counties have been plagued by continuous rain, and the bean harvest is hopeless. Farmers want to use sweet potatoes to fill their hunger, but they cannot get them. The disaster is serious, so how can they bear to collect and borrow in kind again? Recently, the Ministry of Food has established an agency in Qingdao to handle the collection of grain tax in kind. Once the military situation develops smoothly, the collection work will be implemented. Shandong elders Zhang Jieli, Zhang Dongming, An Pengdong, Yu Yuanfang, Du Yingdou, etc., have telegraphed Chairman Chiang requesting that the grain tax collection and borrowing in kind in the province be postponed for one year, and that the counties newly recovered from the Communist area be exempted from taxes for one year from the date of recovery in order to alleviate the people's difficulties.</p>

<h3 id="e48">Suzhou Plans to Try Wireless Telephones Zhou Zhenzhi's Research Yields Results <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Suzhou Dispatch, 19th] Zhou Zhenzhi, a local resident, has been studying wireless telegraphy for a long time and has gained considerable experience. In the past, ultra-shortwave wireless telephones were extremely popular in the United States. If they could be installed in China, even remote areas without electricity could use them to establish close contact with large cities. He has been studying diligently, and recently he has made a more advanced invention than in the United States, that is, the current wireless telephone in the United States has a radius of only about 20 kilometers, while Zhou's research results can reach a radius of 50 kilometers, and he is still continuing to improve. When the Suzhou County Government heard about this, because the garrison was requesting the installation of telephones in various important villages and towns to facilitate military liaison, and after dispatching personnel to plan the line network, it was estimated that 320 million yuan would be needed, which was difficult to pay. On the 19th, they invited Zhou to talk. According to him, this ultra-shortwave wireless telephone has the same method as a wired telephone, but with special equipment, it can avoid setting up telephone lines. The common layout method is to set up a headquarters in the urban area and branch stations in various district offices, and two mobile stations are also set up. If there are a total of eleven stations needed, the cost of all labor and material installation will be about 40 million yuan. Its special features are (1) convenient installation, (3) the line is not easy to damage, (3) it can be set up in places where it is impossible to plant poles and set up lines, such as the isolated East and West Mountains of Taihu Lake, (4) there are mobile radio stations, which can be continuously in communication at any time, which is very beneficial for military affairs, (5) it can also communicate with city telephones, and (6) if there are confidential matters, codes can be used. The county government thought that this equipment was 90% cheaper than wired telephones, and it was quite willing to try it, but the matter was a pioneering initiative, and it was feared that it would cause a sensation, so it urgently telegraphed the provincial government for instructions.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper Suzhou Dispatch] People from all walks of life in this county, in view of the fact that one year has passed since the local restoration, although post-war construction is a hundred things waiting to be done, but because of economic constraints, nothing has been started so far. At this time of hardship, the initiation of construction is probably not something that the simple power of the local government can handle alone.

First, the road police on the train were searched and driven off the train to be monitored on the side. Then, the passengers in the train were extensively looted, and money, jewelry, and valuables were all the bandits' targets. After about an hour, they roared and fled westward. It is estimated that the loss to the passengers was about 50 million yuan. The Security Bureau has reported the case and has launched an investigation. It is noted that the Shangchuan train has been running for decades, and this is the first time it has been robbed.</p>

<h3 id="e57">Improvement of Telecommunications in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui Divided into More Than Ten Districts to Establish Command Bureau <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Suzhou Dispatch, 19th] Mr. Chen Tianzuo, director of the Telecommunications Bureau of this city, recently returned to Suzhou from Nanjing and met with the special correspondent of this newspaper stationed in Suzhou. He said: The Ministry of Transportation, in view of the fact that the development of telecommunications is of great importance to the connection and communication of national political, economic, and military affairs, although the cities and counties in the recovered areas have successively restored the establishment of telecommunications bureaus in the past year, the progress in business has not been as ideal as expected. The key is that the Capital Telecommunications Administration oversees the telecommunications bureaus across the country, and it is difficult to achieve uniform command and close supervision in practice. After consideration by the General Administration, it is planned to implement a system of hierarchical responsibility. The plan is to temporarily divide the three provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui into districts and establish command bureaus in more than ten places, including Suzhou, Wuxi, Zhenjiang, Yongjia, Anqing, and Xuzhou. After success is confirmed, it will be extended to major cities across the country and universally established. The plan has been reviewed and approved by the Ministry of Transportation and will be implemented immediately. The Suzhou Command Bureau has jurisdiction over more than 30 bureaus, including Wujiang, Kunshan, Songjiang, Changshu, Taicang, Jiading, Haimen, and Chongming. The powers of each command bureau are the dispatch of machine affairs and engineering affairs, the supervision of telegraph and telephone business, and the supervision of personnel work, and the preparation of accounting budgets, so that any instructions for reform and innovation from the General Administration can be quickly followed by all cadres without delay. Chen also told reporters that this plan is an unprecedented improvement in the history of Chinese telecommunications and may become a watershed moment in the development of the telecommunications industry in the future.</p>

<h3 id="e59">Cannot Practice Without Gas <a href="#e59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>This semester, the St. John's University Science Laboratory has moved from the old science building to the new science building on the north bank of the Suzhou Creek. Because the new building has not been used for many years and was once occupied by the Japanese army, all the equipment has been damaged. The gas installation for experiments is of course also unusable. After the school repaired it during the summer vacation, it is now only waiting for the gas company to come to the school to install it. Although the school has repeatedly negotiated with the company authorities, there is still no progress. I don't know why? More than three hundred of us chemistry students have been in school for more than a month and have not yet officially started doing practical exercises, which has led to a waste of our studies. We are very anxious! Mr. Cheng, the head of the department, has been running around for this matter, but there is still no solution. We hope that the gas company authorities, for the sake of our studies and the urgent need for talents for national construction, will quickly solve our gas problem.

<p>Guangqi Road in Nanshi connects to Fangbang Middle Road in the north and is now very lively. Fuxing East Road to the south is quite quiet. The original regulations for this farmers market stipulated that it should start from the northern end of Guangqi Road. Today, after a long time, various stalls have gradually encroached on Fangbang Road (an area where the police station prohibits setting up stalls). Not only does it affect the appearance, but it also obstructs traffic. Here is a suggestion: please move this farmers market to Fuxing East Road, or please start from the Huajin Road section of Guangqi Road to the south. This would be a permanent solution and eliminate the need for police to constantly disperse them. This is a simple and beneficial matter, and we hope that the relevant authorities will adopt and implement it. (Gaotang)</p>

<p>We, the people of Northern Jiangsu, cannot withstand the brutal oppression of the Communist bandits and have had to flee to the Jiangnan area as refugees without clothing or food. Our relief authorities, seeing this, have provided universal relief. We, the refugees of Northern Jiangsu, are very grateful for this. However, because the refugees have no means of livelihood and are constantly on the move, many of them are unable to receive the flour that is distributed in each phase. The refugees are crying out for food and hope that the relief authorities will understand our difficulties and kindly reissue the flour, so that the refugees who have not been able to receive flour will be endlessly grateful.

<h3 id="e64">America Willing to Seek Friendship with All Nations - Key to Peace Lies with the Soviet Union - Byrnes Explains American Foreign Policy <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 18th] After returning home, Secretary of State Byrnes gave his first radio address last night, discussing the progress of the peace conference, US-Soviet relations, and the establishment of future peace. He stated: The American people are willing to extend a hand of friendship to the people of the Soviet Union and other countries who are tired of war. The slow progress of peace creates the impression that armed conflict is inevitable. The inability of Soviet leaders to dispel this impression is the root cause of our disagreement. The so-called American encirclement of the Soviet Union is a figment of imagination. We can know from Marshal Stalin's own statement that the Soviet Union does not find itself in a dangerous encirclement. Promoting understanding and sympathy between the US and the Soviet Union is a difficult task for politicians. The United States opposes the idea that one country must completely submit to all the demands of another. At the same time, the United States will continue to oppose the policy of forming individual alliances. I believe that if the idea that conflict is inevitable persists, there is no hope for the economic recovery of Europe. As for the Paris Peace Conference, most of the peace draft articles have not been decided, but this is not a cause for concern. What is concerning is the continued tension in Soviet-Soviet relations and its growth.</p>
<p>At this moment, the United States continues to seek friendship with the people of the Soviet Union and other countries based on justice and respect for the rights of others, but the fairness and respect of the rights of the United States itself must also be taken into account. The United States must participate in cooperation to establish a new world order, the purpose of which is not to support the status quo, but to maintain a just peace and freedom. Completing this task requires patience. We must steadily build a peace mechanism so that it is as solid as a rock.</p>
<h3 id="e65">Wallace Criticizes <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>[This Newspaper] San Francisco, 19th Broadcast: Former Secretary of Commerce Wallace recently made a statement criticizing Secretary of State Byrnes's speech on American foreign policy today, saying that he "is more convinced that the United States will adopt a realistic foreign policy." Wallace continued, "Byrnes has made progress compared to when he gave the Stuttgart speech. I hope that he will continue to make progress in the future. I am convinced that the American Secretary of State will eventually realize that the American people need international justice, good neighborliness, and peace."</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 18th] Washington political figures are completely satisfied with Secretary of State Byrnes's radio address last night, believing that this is the clearest explanation of American foreign policy. If one can say, Secretary of State Byrnes has stated that the responsibility for peace now lies with the Soviet Union, because no one can doubt that American policy is a truly peaceful policy. At the same time, it must also be admitted that if the Soviet Union does not strive to resolve disputes with the United States, peace is impossible. The next international conference will be broader in scope, and at least it can open the door to resolving this dispute. When the four foreign ministers meet next time, the current world tension may be greatly eased. In fact, Byrnes's remarks should be regarded as the opinion of most of the American people and are fully endorsed by the cabinet. Byrnes's call for promoting friendship with the Soviet Union deserves attention. In short, the Secretary of State's call is by no means in vain.</p>

<p>[Agence France-Presse, Belgrade, 18th] Yugoslav Deputy Foreign Minister Van Le Pete told this newspaper that if Yugoslavia wants to sign the peace treaty with Italy passed by the Paris Peace Conference, it must be amended on two points. That is (1) to increase the power of the people in the Trieste Free Zone to make appeals, and to restrict the powers of its administrative chief. (2) Re-surveying the border south of Trieste, that is, maintaining the existing boundary line without following the draft agreement. If the four foreign ministers pass the treaty in its current form at the New York meeting in the future, the Southern Kingdom will not be bound by it, and will still maintain its relationship with Italy based on the armistice agreement. However, if Italy admits its past crimes of aggression against the Southern Kingdom, the Southern Kingdom is also willing to negotiate directly with it.</p>

<p>[United Press, Capital of Ceylon, 18th] A small train rollover accident occurred here today, killing four and injuring more than 40. The cause of the accident was the digging of the tracks. The authorities believe that this was done by striking railway workers. More than 4,000 railway workers went on strike yesterday demanding increased wages. The labor unrest has expanded to port workers today, and port transportation has completely stopped. Workers hired by the municipal government and workers of the gas company have also gone on strike. The total number of strikers has reached 25,000.</p>
<h3 id="e72">Southern Country Abuses American Citizens - United States Sends Note to Condemn <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 18th] The State Department today submitted a note to Yugoslavia expressing "disgust and condemnation" for the country's driving of 165 Americans into hard labor. It is said that the Tito government drove naturalized American citizens into concentration camps, abused them, and was extremely cruel. Some of them died because they could not bear the pain, and the survivors were hired by private individuals to work for a long time without pay. When asked about the number of deaths, a State Department official replied that two deaths have been confirmed, but according to outside knowledge, as many as ten have died. The American note also stated that the victims were deprived of their inherent rights and should be remedied quickly. Some of the slaves mentioned in the note are not considered American citizens by Yugoslavia. However, the State Department said that their applications for American citizenship have been approved. This matter seems to be worsening the US-Soviet relations, because according to official announcements, at least three of the people involved in the case have been transferred to the Soviet Union to be forced to work. Previously, Yugoslavia informed the United States that the detained people may be made to work in appropriate ways, denying the United States' so-called hard labor dispatch. The United States refuted it with a note.</p>

<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 19th] The soil ambassador to the UK told the press last night that the Tartar Strait is Turkish territory, and its defense should always be controlled by Turkey. Turkey has taken a very firm attitude on this matter and has not received any foreign support. Turkey feels strong and united, and cannot soften its stance on this matter. The control of the Tartar Strait is stipulated by the Mondru public. If the control is to be reformed to adapt to modern needs, an international conference should be convened to revise the treaty. Since the Potsdam Conference, Turkey believes that there is no need for relevant parties to hold individual discussions. Turkey's fundamental attitude is to maintain its independence and maintain friendship with the Soviet Union and Western countries. However, Turkey is a Mediterranean country and a Black Sea country. The Tartar Strait connects the two seas. Turkey does not want to see this strait jointly managed by others.</p>

<p>[United Press London, 19th] The case of the Duchess of Windsor's stolen jewels, valued at $800,000, is currently being vigorously investigated by top detectives from Britain and France. Police authorities in North and South America, as well as diamond market centers in Europe, have been alerted to watch for any discovered stolen items. Among the stolen jewels is a 41.4-carat gold-set sapphire ring, with a gemstone as large as a pigeon egg. Another sapphire ring weighs 7.81 carats, and yet another ring weighs 58.2 carats.</p>
<p>[United Press London, 18th] Following the theft of a portion of the Duchess of Windsor's jewelry, police authorities have launched an active investigation. It is speculated that this case was the work of an international thief gang, hence the investigation is extensive, covering Europe and across the Atlantic. According to Windsor, the stolen jewels are worth approximately $880,000 U.S. dollars, and he is displeased by external overestimation.</p>

<h3 id="e79">Göring's Poison Hidden in Navel <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>[French Press Agency, Nuremberg, 18th] Regarding the suicide of former German Air Minister Göring by poisoning before his execution, someone who witnessed the examination of Göring's body stated that the potassium cyanide Göring took was likely contained in a metal tube and secretly hidden in his navel. Göring had previously undergone abdominal surgery, and near his navel was a very deep cavity that could hold a metal tube, pencil-sized and up to 2-3 centimeters long. When experts examined Göring's body, they discovered ulceration around his navel, possibly caused by leakage from the tube, leading to skin inflammation. Although Dr. Pfoellockner, the German physician responsible for the health of the prisoners, frequently searched the convicts for poison, he apparently did not notice this peculiar feature of Göring's abdomen. It is generally believed that Göring hid the potassium cyanide before his capture, similar to what Himmler and Goebbels did. It has also been learned that the ropes used to hang the Nazi war criminals were burned along with the bodies, and any unused ropes were also destroyed by fire. The location of the cremation remains a closely guarded secret, it is only known that the four generals representing the Allied Control Council for Germany were present at the cremation to supervise.</p>

<p>[Reuters London, 18th] Foreign Secretary Bevin and Egyptian Prime Minister Sidky Pasha secretly exchanged views on the issue of revising the Anglo-Egyptian treaty for the first time inside the British Foreign Office. Prior to that, Prime Minister Attlee hosted a luncheon for Sidky Pasha at his residence, with guests including South African Prime Minister Smuts, British Defense Minister Alexander, Imperial Chief of Staff Montgomery, and Bevin. Although the luncheon was a social event, the participation of important imperial military strategists and politicians suggests the importance of Egypt in imperial defense. Currently, the main issues between Britain and Egypt are: (1) The deadline for the complete withdrawal of British troops from Egypt, with the British recently suggesting three years. (2) The conditions for the activities of the Anglo-Egyptian Joint Defense Board: should they only be triggered when Egypt's neighboring countries are at war, or can they be triggered by just the threat of war? (3) Egypt's demand for the unification of Sudan, which Britain is not yet willing to unconditionally recognize.</p>
<p>[United Press, Cairo, 18th] British troops were ordered today to refrain from entering the city of Cairo, and the police have taken special precautions, especially in the vicinity of the El-Azhar mosque. In the past, every Friday, the Muslim Sabbath, thousands of people would attend noon prayers inside the mosque. Some observers believe that Egyptian Prime Minister Sidky Pasha's trip to England for negotiations is the reason for these precautions.</p>

<h3 id="e84">The Yoshida Cabinet and Labor Unrest <a href="#e84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>[Our Tokyo Correspondent, 15th] Since the outbreak of the National Railway Workers' strike, the labor camp under the leadership of the Communist Party, the All-Japan Industries Labor Unions Conference (General Council of All Industries Unions), and the government have been in complete opposition. The union recently issued a circular to all branches to launch the October Offensive, attempting to paralyze all production sectors with the weapon of joint struggle, namely a general strike, to overthrow the Yoshida Cabinet. The development of this political strike movement has not only profoundly affected all industries but has also caused great anxiety in general social life. Recently, the government has planned to take a tough stance on the labor movement, suddenly announcing the implementation of the Labor Relations Adjustment Law on the 13th. The union believes this is a good opportunity to launch a joint struggle, proposing: (1) Absolute opposition to layoffs, (2) Achieving full employment, (3) Establishing a minimum wage based on living expenses, (4) Abolishing the 500-yen limit, (5) Implementing an eight-hour workday, (6) Revoking the Labor Relations Adjustment Law, (7) Establishing strike targets, (8) Establishing unemployment insurance and social insurance laws, (9) Opposing violence and government disruption of strikes, (10) Abolishing discrimination against women, (11) Reviving production with the people's hands, (12) Opposing oppressive taxes on farmers, (13) Overthrowing the Yoshida Cabinet. It is clear that the main goals of this October Offensive are: (1) Overthrowing the Yoshida Cabinet, (2) Establishing a democratic people's government. Currently, the workers who have decided to participate in the strike include coal miners, electricity workers, film workers, theater workers, postal and telecommunications workers, machinery workers, vehicle workers, doctors, teachers, and national railway workers, among whom the movements of the coal miners are the most crucial. All Hokkaido coal miners have already joined the strike, and a part of the Joban coal mine has also joined. Coal is the driving force of Japanese industry, and once the strike expands, coal production will inevitably decrease, which would be a major blow to the Japanese economy. The coal production plan for this month is 1.85 million tons. If the coal miners strike, the amount of coal allocated to various industries in mid-October will be reduced by half; in other words, the driving force of Japanese industry will be halved as a result. Once a general strike by workers in various industries is realized, the number of participants will reach 800,000. However, whether the October Offensive called for by the union will succeed is still in question, because (1) the positions of the various branches are not consistent, and it is questionable whether some branches will participate. For example, the workers in life insurance, port operations, Allied forces labor, lumber, and civil engineering have all had their wages improved considerably. (2) The opinions among the unions are not yet consistent, such as the Kyushu coal miners branch and the Shochiku film branch. (3) The Labor Adjustment Law has already been implemented. Industrial workers restricted by this law, namely workers in industries related to the public interest, cannot strike arbitrarily, including electricity, coal, news, chemical, and fertilizer workers. Prime Minister Yoshida met with newspaper reporters in Osaka yesterday, stating that he would crack down on labor unrest in accordance with the Labor Adjustment Law. In the general meeting of the House of Representatives on the 11th, he said that political strikes were actions that exceeded the scope of the labor movement. At the same time, the General Federation of Labor under the leadership of the Socialist Party, reversing its past passive attitude, convened a central standing committee on the 12th, deciding to oppose political strikes, believing that this move would alienate labor unions from the people and promote the rise of reactionary forces; and declaring that if the Yoshida Cabinet continues to adopt an industrial economic and labor policy that supports capitalists, it will be overthrown. The press in this area expresses great concern about the current labor disputes. The Asahi Shimbun stated in an editorial on the 12th that the headquarters of the industries unions should adopt a cautious attitude towards the general strike; the Yomiuri Shimbun, which is the most vehemently anti-communist, stated in an editorial on the 10th that the actions of the industries unions conference are no different from challenging the people and are enemies of society. This October Offensive is an important test period for the Yoshida Cabinet, but the continuation of the Yoshida Cabinet depends on many external factors. After the closing of the Diet, Yoshida met with reporters on the 12th, indicating that he would continue to govern and hoped that the Liberal and Progressive parties would merge, while Washington transmitted the news of an early convening of a peace conference with Japan. The internal and external situation suggests that the October Offensive called for by the Communist Party is not enough to inflict a fatal blow on the Yoshida Cabinet. Furthermore, it has been reported that the Japanese government awarded medals to the Japanese police officers injured in the 渋谷 incident. According to the Japanese Economic Shimbun of the 14th, Patrolman Yoshihiro Kawakami of the Meguro Police Station in Tokyo, while performing police duties with Chief Haga, who died in the attack on the 渋谷 Police Station on July 19, was shot in the chest but did not yield, and ultimately established outstanding merit. He was awarded the Police Merit Medal and a special medal on the 15th. It was generally believed that the patrolman would not recover, but he has now recovered completely, which is truly a miracle.</p>

<h3 id="e85">Eleven Members of the Visiting Taiwan Journalist Group Returned to Shanghai Yesterday, The Governor-General's Office Held a Press Conference Before Their Departure, Explaining the Current Administrative Measures in Taiwan Province <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>A group of 22 journalists from Beijing, Shanghai, Ping, and Kunming flew to Taiwan from Shanghai on the 12th. After inspecting various parts of Taiwan, the visit has been completed. A portion of the members, eleven in number, returned to Shanghai yesterday afternoon at 2:30 pm led by Xu Xiaoyan, the Deputy Director of the Propaganda Department and the leader of the visiting group. The remaining members will stay for another three days to gather more material from the general public and are scheduled to return to Shanghai on the 22nd. The day before the journalist group returned to Shanghai, Chen Yi, the Chief Executive of Taiwan Province, and Jian Jingheng, the Secretary-General, invited the journalist group to hold a press conference at Caoshan Guest House. The heads of various departments of the Chief Executive's Office were also present. The journalists raised questions about the lack of understanding among people in mainland China regarding Taiwan Province, the current systems in Taiwan Province that caused dissatisfaction, and the issues of not allowing the four major banks to establish branches in Taiwan and issuing Taiwanese currency. Chen and the heads of the relevant departments answered these questions separately.</p>
<h3 id="e86">Taiwan's Financial Issues, Before Domestic Currency System and Prices are Stable, Issuing Taiwan Currency is Considered a Good Method <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>According to Chen, the issuance of Taiwan currency was in accordance with central government policy. When Japan surrendered, the financial situation in Taiwan was quite stable. There were no branches of Japanese banks such as the Yokohama Specie Bank in Taiwan. Everything was centered around the Bank of Taiwan. To stabilize the financial situation in Taiwan Province, the government decided to temporarily maintain the status quo of the Bank of Taiwan and the Taiwan currency it issued. After the takeover was completed, new Taiwan currency would be issued, and it was decided that the Central Bank of China, the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Agricultural Bank of China would not establish branches in Taiwan for the time being. This was to wait until the central government had decided on a new currency system before establishing branches, so that Taiwan's financial system could maintain its old state and not be affected by the domestic financial chaos. The powers of the four banks would be exercised by the Bank of Taiwan on behalf. The interest rate on loans from the Bank of Taiwan was 3.6%, with a maximum of 6.6%. If other banks came to Taiwan to compete for deposits with high interest rates, and then used these deposits to operate in Shanghai, lending them out at interest rates as high as one dime or more, it would inevitably cause chaos in Taiwan's financial system. Currency is a matter of vital concern to the people. When this policy was implemented, not only did the mainland not understand, but even the people of Taiwan did not understand, especially the public officials and soldiers who came to Taiwan from the mainland. However, now it is known that it was fortunate that this policy was implemented, which was able to maintain the value of all the property of the people of Taiwan, and the consequences of low interest rates, low prices, and financial stability. This policy has been recognized as the best method in Taiwan Province. Before the central currency system and prices are stable, Taiwan currency must still be used temporarily to adapt to the needs of the environment. If the environment no longer requires it in the future, the national currency can be used at any time. The Bank of Taiwan has already been transformed into a bank with private capital. Its directors and supervisors are all appointed by the central government, and the issuance of Taiwan currency is also completely subject to the supervision of the central government.</p>
<h3 id="e87">Powers of the Governor-General's Office <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the powers of the Governor-General's Office, rumors that its powers were higher than those of the Japanese Governor-General's Office era are not accurate. Currently, the judicial, diplomatic, postal and telecommunications, and financial affairs of Taiwan Province are all handled by the Ministry of Justice, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Transportation, and the Ministry of Finance, respectively. Aviation is managed by the Air Force Headquarters. Some important enterprises have either been directly operated by the central government or jointly operated by the central government and the province. All of these are in accordance with the instructions of the central government and are in line with the overall national policy. The situation is very different from the Governor-General's Office of Taiwan during the Japanese occupation, which ruled over everything. However, due to the inconvenient transportation between Taiwan Province and the mainland, President Chiang Kai-shek granted the Governor-General's Office greater powers and can command all central government agencies in Taiwan. In addition, I also serve as the Commander of the Garrison Headquarters. Furthermore, because of the different names of the Governor-General's Office and the Provincial Government, it has been criticized by the outside world. Chen also said earnestly that the central government must give the provinces considerable powers and cannot be too strict, otherwise the provincial government will not be able to handle affairs. When he was in charge of Fujian Province, he and the chairmen of various provinces jointly requested the central government to grant the provincial governments the same powers as the current Governor-General's Office of Taiwan, but it was not approved by the Executive Yuan. Chen further stated that all of Taiwan's resources are in the mountains. Similar mountains are also found in Fujian, Guangdong, and Jiangxi provinces, and they have various conditions that are even better than those in Taiwan, but we cannot develop them. We feel that Taiwan is good after being operated by the Japanese, but if we follow the current organization law of the provincial government, it will definitely not be built well, and the supervisors can only be officials and cannot do things. Secondly, the province is too strict with the counties, so the province will also release as much as possible the governing power and funds of the province to the counties, implement the county autonomy implementation law that President Sun Yat-sen advocated most vigorously, so that all public officials and six million people in the province can do their best to develop their strength and further construction work.</p>

<h3 id="e88">Monopoly is Not Control <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>Everyone says that Taiwan Province has a controlled economy and cannot understand the establishment of the Monopoly Bureau and the Trade Bureau, as well as the currency policy. In fact, Taiwan Province is the best place for our country to implement the Principle of People's Livelihood. The benefits that can be obtained from public operation are distributed to the people. After Taiwan Province was recovered, 50% of the financial revenue came from monopoly income, so the people's taxes were very light. Most of the revenue in the province's budget also depends on monopoly and trade. This year's budget is 270 million yuan (Taiwan currency), but it is expected to exceed this number. If there is 500 million yuan in revenue, the excess amount can be used for construction. Furthermore, if this money is earned by businessmen, it will only increase personal luxury and then use this money for speculation and exploitation of the people, while the government will inevitably increase taxes and burden the people. Chen also guarantees that there is no official capital in the trade and factories operated in Taiwan Province. It is entirely national capital to reward the implementation of President Sun Yat-sen's national capital policy to develop industry. At the same time, the land policy is implemented to ensure that tillers have their own land. After the takeover, public land in Taiwan Province accounts for 70% of the province's area. Currently, all public land taken over by various agencies, except for those that must be retained for their own business, are all temporarily leased by the county and city governments to the original tenants or farm laborers to continue cultivation, so as to avoid the interruption of production. It is also planned to establish public land distribution promotion associations in various counties and cities this year to assist in reviewing and distributing the land. It is planned to complete the distribution work in three phases in July 1947. Chen also repeatedly and earnestly stated that national capital must be developed in Taiwan, and the public morality and integrity of service personnel must be cultivated, and they must be guaranteed in their living environment so that they can work with peace of mind, strengthen their organizational power, and develop industry, so that China's economy can be stabilized. Otherwise, the result will be that our country will become slaves to foreign goods.</p>
<h3 id="e89">Civil Affairs Situation <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>Zhou Yiyi, the director of the Civil Affairs Department, answered the questions about the civil affairs situation in Taiwan Province, saying that the city and county councils in Taiwan Province were established one after another before March 16. The provincial councilors were produced on April 15, and the first meeting was held on May 1. The people of Taiwan Province are enthusiastic and frank, but because they have been separated from the mainland for 50 years, they have many gaps in their understanding of the culture and laws of the motherland. However, each meeting has been more on track than the previous one. In the past, Taiwan Province held reserve personnel for unemployed people. There were more than 5,000 registered educational, technical, and civil servants. Recently, a general registration was held, and more than 10,000 people have reported. They have been notified to the various agencies to be included in the reserve list, and they will be assigned to work after passing the examination and short-term training. A portion of them have already replaced the work of repatriated Japanese residents. The number of unemployed women is not very large. However, there is also a distorted phenomenon in Taiwan Province. On the one hand, people are calling for unemployment, and on the other hand, factories that have resumed work cannot find workers. The overseas Taiwanese do not want to work and hope to become civil servants, but their knowledge is not suitable for being civil servants.</p>
<h3 id="e90">Current Financial Status <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>Yan Jiagan, the director of the Finance Department, answered various financial questions, saying that the amount of Taiwan currency issued in October 1945, when the takeover took place, was 2,897,837,519.50 yuan. At the end of September 1946, the amount of currency issued was 4,030,922,360.50 yuan, an increase of 1,133 million yuan compared to the time of the takeover. The Bank of Taiwan has lent 2 billion yuan to the production sector, with sugar loans accounting for 1.5 billion yuan. If loans were not held, the amount of currency issued would not have increased so much. Since the takeover, the price ratio has risen from 100% to 450%. The deadline for exchanging old Taiwan currency for new Taiwan currency will be at the end of this month at the latest. Recently, the Bank of Taiwan also plans to provide 6 billion yuan in sugar loans at low interest rates to increase production. Among the state-owned companies in Taiwan Province taken over by the Resources Commission, there are three companies, including the aluminum factory. Among the state-province joint-venture companies, there are seven companies, including sugar, cement, and mechanical shipbuilding. There are 18 province-run factories, including 13 industrial and mining factories, 5 agricultural and forestry factories, and 1 health factory. In addition to these 28 companies, there are more than 400 factories that are planned to be sold. The first batch of 23 factories has been publicly announced for sale, and the second batch of 30 factories will also be sold. After the organization of the ten province-run companies is on track, a portion of the shares will be sold on the market, so that the ownership of capital belongs to private individuals, while the right to use capital is controlled by the state, so that private capital and state enterprise funds can be coordinated.</p>
<h3 id="e91">Opinions of Provincial Councilors, Hoping that the Governor-General's Office Will Be Changed to the Provincial Government, Eagerly Awaiting Domestic Peace and Implementation of Constitutional Government <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>Two hours before the journalist group flew away from Taipei, they were invited by the Provincial Council to hold a symposium at Zhongshan Hall. Huang Chaoqin, the speaker of the Provincial Council, and the councilors reported and answered the general situation of the people of Taiwan. The main points are as follows: (1) The Provincial Council insists that the province will not use the national currency in the next four to five years before the domestic currency system is stable. The people of Taiwan are willing to fully support the policy of using Taiwan currency in the Governor-General's Office. (2) During the most difficult period after the war, Japan levied indirect taxes in Taiwan. The Governor-General's Office still continues to levy these taxes without withdrawing them, which is regrettable. (3) The people of Taiwan unanimously hope that the Governor-General's Office will be changed to the Provincial Government immediately, the Governor will be changed to the Chairman, and local autonomy will be implemented as soon as possible. (4) Eagerly await domestic peace and the implementation of constitutional government. (5) Farmers' lives have been stabilized after the recovery because they are no longer oppressed and requisitioned by the Japanese consortiums. Their only current request is to ask for fertilizer relief. The price of rice is now 20 times higher than before the recovery, and the price of other commodities is even higher. There are 3 million farmers in Taiwan, and the taxes they pay are also 33 times higher than before the recovery. It is hoped that the taxes will be reduced. (5) Those who come to Taiwan for tourism think that Taiwan is good and that Taiwan's finances are more stable than those in the mainland, but in the eyes of the Taiwanese, it is worse than during the Japanese occupation and the economy is more painful. The reason is inflation and high prices. (6) Industry should be nationalized and not bureaucratized, otherwise production cannot be developed. It is hoped that a portion of the sugar will be given to private operation. (7) The unemployment problem is extremely serious. There are 200,000 Taiwanese who were conscripted by the Japanese to Nanyang and returned to Taiwan, together with the unemployed people in Taiwan Province, there are a total of 300,000 people. The middle and upper-level personnel who are accommodated by various agencies are mostly from other provinces, while the lower-level personnel are mostly from Taiwan Province, so the general Taiwanese are not interested in work.</p>
<h3 id="e92">Restore Bombed Factories, Hold New Emerging Businesses, Encourage Sugarcane Farmers to Cultivate and Seek to Restore Pre-War Production <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>The situation of industry and mining in Taiwan is fundamentally different from that in the Beijing, Shanghai, and Wuhan areas. Last year, when the Japanese were about to surrender, most of the industry and mining had been shut down by bombing. Over the past year, we have done our best to obtain the materials, financial resources, and manpower, and most of them have now been restored. For example, the electricity is twice that of the time of the takeover, and the coal production is six times that of the time of the takeover. It can be seen from these two points that the general increase in production. In short, our main work in the past year has been to restore the bombed factories, especially to focus on basic industries such as electricity, coal, sugar, fertilizer, cement, electrolysis industry, and paper. In the future, in addition to continuing to do the above-mentioned restoration work, we also plan to hold new businesses, such as new fertilizer factories, glass plate factories, and flax spinning. The industry and mining in Taiwan used to be matched with what Japan needed and with the needs of wartime. In the future, they should be matched with what China needs and with the needs of China's revival. According to our plans in various departments, five years later, Taiwan can become one of the most powerful provinces in China's economy. Regarding rice grains for agricultural affairs, the output in the first phase of this year was 4,737,112 hectoliters. The main countermeasures of this office to restore pre-war production are: (1) Constructing water conservancy. As of the end of July this year, all 47 destroyed water conservancy projects in the province have been repaired. In addition, the Tsengwen Reservoir, Kaohsiung, Samsung, and Yuanlin water conservancy projects are being rushed to repair. (2) Distributing fertilizer. In the past year, more than 13 million kilograms of fertilizer purchased from domestic and foreign sources have been distributed to farmers. Recently, a chemical fertilizer of 200,000 tons has been purchased from the Executive Yuan. At the same time, fertilizer factories are being set up in the province to seek self-sufficiency. Sugarcane, in June, this office held a sugarcane business discussion meeting and stipulated: (1) The sugarcane planting target for 1947 is 91,425 hectares. (2) Implementing the sugar distribution method of 52% for the company and 48% for the farmers to encourage sugarcane farmers to cultivate. A loan of 90 million yuan has been approved to seek to restore pre-war production for outward promotion.</p>
<h3 id="e93">Methods of Compiling the Living Index <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>The Municipal Federation of Trade Unions Held Its First Lecture, with Representatives from the Municipal Government Attending to Explain</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM, the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions held its first lecture at its headquarters, inviting the person in charge of the Municipal Government's Statistics Department to explain the compilation process of the workers' living index. Attendees included Zhou Shishu, a representative from the Municipal Government, Zhao Banfu, the director of the Social Affairs Bureau, Zhou Ze from the Municipal Party Headquarters, and 251 units from various trade unions. Zhou Shishu, the representative from the Municipal Government, reported on the methods used to compile the workers' living index, dividing them into three parts:</p>
<p>(1) Compilation Method: The currently published monthly workers' cost of living index is based on the "Household Survey" of 1942, with 1936 as the base period. The so-called "Household Survey" investigates the general living conditions of a certain class in order to determine the consumption level of various goods, which serves as the consumption quantity within the index. The method starts with bookkeeping and then proceeds to analysis. The analysis method involves adding up the consumption of the same goods by each household to find the average consumption per household, and the consumption quantity determines the types of goods that should be included in the index. Only the most commonly used items with the highest consumption quantities are selected, with several varieties chosen for each type. Currently, the index includes 54 selected items. Food category: including rice (Wu and), corn, flour (domestic Tong flour), noodles, soybeans (medium-sized), fresh pork (ribs), fresh beef (water buffalo sirloin), salted pork (ribs), fresh fish, salted fish, vegetables, spinach, chives, sweet potatoes, white radish, pickled mustard greens, soybean sprouts, sprouted beans, tofu, dried tofu, bean curd sheets, fermented bean curd, soybean oil, soy sauce, salt, white sugar, tea, sorghum, etc. Housing category: including housing, boiled water, electricity, matches, coal briquettes, firewood, etc. Clothing category: fine cloth, coarse cloth, striped cloth, flower-label cloth, bleached cloth, Indanthrene blue cloth, twill cloth, velvet, woolen cloth, cotton, socks, etc. Miscellaneous items: including streetcars, cigarettes, soap, toilet paper, haircuts.</p>
<p>(2) Price Investigation Method: The price of goods in this city is very chaotic, with different prices for the same item. Therefore, the investigation methods, areas, and deadlines are strictly regulated. The surveyed stores are allocated based on the distribution of workers. Currently, the surveyed areas are: East District (Hongkou area), South District (Dapuqiao area), and West District (Caojiadu Dazimingzhong area). The investigation period is set as once a week on Wednesdays, with staff dispatched to the designated stores to fill out the investigation form.</p>
<p>(3) Calculation Method: First, let's discuss the price averaging method. The price of each item used in the index is the average price of all stores each week, and then the arithmetic average of each period is taken as the monthly average price. As for the calculation method of the index, it is calculated according to the following formula: Recently, various sectors have had doubts about the index. This is because the numbers used to compile the living index are calculated using the monthly average price. When prices rise, the index cannot keep up with the speed of price increases because the monthly average price is different from the daily price fluctuations. The recent stability of rice prices is also a major reason why the index has not risen significantly. As for the 54 items in the index, their content may differ significantly from what a family of five encounters in their daily lives. Therefore, there have been considerations to revise the content of the index, but another "Household Survey" is required.</p>
<p>Finally, Zhang Zhusan suggested forming a living index research committee, and Zhang Zhusan, Hu, Zhou Zhongqing, Lin Chunting, Zhu Junxin, Zhu Weichang, Dong Renliang, Guo Xing, Wan Guangzhang, Gao Guoliang, Huang Yuexiang, Song Peiyao, Zhang Jindi, Yao Zhuoren, Feng Gangyin, and fifteen others were elected as members. It was also resolved that: (1) Soybeans and wheat bran should be removed from the food category, and the quality of non-glutinous rice should be improved. (2) The authorities are urged to conduct a new household survey, using the living standards of 1929 as the standard before the survey. (3) Child education and medical expenses should be added to the index as miscellaneous expenses. (4) The index should be published twice a month. (5) The index should be raised. The meeting adjourned at 5:00 PM.</p>

<p>A local woman, Yang Ying, married Yang Shijun as her wife, and the couple had a very good relationship. Unfortunately, four years ago, Yang Shijun was detained by the court on suspicion of kidnapping and sentenced to imprisonment for four years and six months. Since her husband's detention, Yang Ying's life has been greatly affected. Moreover, she is still young and not used to sleeping alone. Two years ago, through the introduction of her elder sister, she became acquainted with Wu Pande (42 years old), a Sichuan native. The two lived together at 88 Hengmao Lane, Xizang South Road. Unexpectedly, Yang Shijun was released from prison this summer and learned that his wife had remarried. He immediately went to negotiate. Wu asked someone to reconcile with Yang and paid Yang Shijun 3.5 million yuan three times as compensation for giving up his wife. At around 10:00 PM the night before last, Yang Shijun went to a hotel alone to drink and got very drunk. Thinking of his wife being taken by someone else, he was very angry. After drinking, he broke into 88 Hengmao Lane, kicked the door open, and started smashing everything, destroying the furniture.

<h3 id="e111">Important Notes on Declaring Rent for Rent Survey <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>[This Newspaper] The deadline for the Municipal Finance Bureau's rent survey is approaching soon. To facilitate citizens, the bureau will still process registration procedures for those who send their rent declaration forms after the deadline.</p>
<p>Also, the rental situation in this city is extremely complex. After considering the actual situation, the bureau has stipulated the following important notes for filling out rent declaration forms:</p>
<p>(1) The purpose of this rent survey is to allocate the amount of house tax and municipal construction tax separately so that the burden between the landlord and the tenant is clear. If the rent declaration is not detailed or is not submitted, making it impossible to allocate, the bureau will issue a payment notice listing only the total amount of the two taxes without listing them separately. After the supplementary declaration is submitted, a notice will be issued again. Alternatively, after the residents pay, they will allocate it themselves according to the rent paid. (2) If the rent is undecided due to housing rental disputes, the reason can be noted after the rent item on the declaration form. (3) For houses subleased by a sub-landlord who does not live in the house, the amount of rent paid to the sub-landlord can be filled in, and an additional note can be added at the end of the form. (4) If the rental situation of the house varies in different months, a note can be added month by month after the rent item. (5) When mailing the declaration form, seal it according to the regulations and affix sufficient postage.</p>

<p>According to Deputy Director Hou of the Jinpu Railway Administration, the Administration has ordered ten 280 Consolidation locomotives from the United States due to a shortage of transportation materials. They are expected to arrive in Shanghai within this year. Other materials, such as American sleepers, are also arriving one after another. However, the number of sleepers ordered is small because the price of sleepers is very high, and the Administration is unable to purchase them in large quantities due to limited funds.</p>

<p>[Reported by This Newspaper] Following the arrest of Russian fur trader Isaii Vitesson in connection with the hand grenade case at the New Light Theater, authorities discovered that after the surrender of Japan, he purchased ninety-eight cases of loose artificial pearls from the Showa Trading Company at an extremely low price. This is a criminal act, as the artificial pearls were originally enemy property and should have been taken over by the Chinese government.</p>
<p>Vitesson’s accomplice, Birbrier, left Shanghai for Mexico shortly after the end of the war. It is also understood that some of the pearls have been shipped to other locations. The transaction took place in room 241C of the Grosvenor Apartments, which was Birbrier's residence. The transaction was facilitated by Captain Kuroki, a Japanese liaison officer of the Russian Emigrant Association. The case is currently under further investigation.</p>

<p>[Reported by This Newspaper] Xu Jianping, who successively held positions such as Chief of the Investigation Department of the Puppet Central Reserve Bank, General Manager of the Puppet Central Trust Corporation, and Director of the General Affairs Department of the Puppet Ministry of Finance, was yesterday sentenced by the High Court to five years in prison, with deprivation of civil rights for five years. All of his property will be confiscated, except for a portion set aside for the necessary living expenses of his family. Xu is currently 56 years old, a native of Jiaxing, Zhejiang. He graduated from Tsinghua University and later studied at the University of Michigan in the United States. After returning to China, he briefly headed the editorial department of the Continental Daily before collaborating with the Japanese after the Pacific War.</p>
<p>Liu Quan, who served as the Director of the Puppet Hankou Consolidated Tax Bureau and the Salt Administration Bureau, was notorious for his extortionate taxes and oppression of the people. After the victory, he was exposed and arrested. The High Court concluded his case yesterday, and the sentence is scheduled to be announced on the 26th of this month. Additionally, Russian citizen Mr. Voltolehoff, accused of working as an intelligence officer for the enemy's radio station on Jing'an Temple Road in this city, concluded his defense yesterday, and his sentence is also scheduled to be announced on the 26th.</p>

<h3 id="e117">New Company to Take Over the Tangqiao-Datuan Highway <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>[Reported by This Newspaper] The highway from Tangqiao in Pudong to Yaojia in the Puhui County area was originally contracted by the Pudong Long-Distance Bus Company with the municipal government in November of the 26th year of the Republic (1937) for an advance payment road construction franchise agreement, stipulating a term of 30 years from the date of formal opening of the entire road upon completion of the project. After the victory, the majority of shareholders of the company re-pooled their shares in July of this year to organize the Pudong Local Construction Company and establish a new contract. The original Pudong Long-Distance Bus Company voluntarily terminated the old contract. It is reported that the Public Utilities Bureau has approved this. The route runs from Tangqiao, passing through Zhoupu, Nanhui, and Haichao Temple, reaching Datuan as the final point (near the border of Fengxian County), with a total length of 54 kilometers. The opening of this road is very beneficial to the development of Pudong.  [Reported by This Newspaper] In mid-July, this newspaper published a feature article titled "The Pig Meat Chapter," introducing the history of the pig. The article concluded: "National affairs are complicated, and the clouds of war are unpredictable. If a war breaks out, and the source of pigs is cut off, will it cause a meat shortage?" Three months have passed since the article, and although the feared meat shortage has not yet become a reality, meat prices have indeed risen to the point where ordinary people feel a sense of "sighing at the sight of meat."</p>
<p>From the hands of farmers to the stomachs of consumers, pigs undergo many transfers in the process of becoming meat, so prices increase layer by layer. First, pig dealers purchase them from the place of origin and transport them to Shanghai, where they are concentrated in warehouses around Yunzaobang, Zhanghuabang, and Zhoujiaqiao. Then, they are entrusted to pig brokers for sale. The nature of pig brokers is the same as that of brokers, only responsible for introductions, selling the live pigs to butcher shops and collecting commissions, but some also provide loans to pig dealers. After purchasing the live pigs, butcher shops slaughter them at the slaughterhouse and wholesale whole pieces to retail meat vendors, and finally they are sold in the vegetable market.</p>
<p>Yesterday's market price was 2,650 yuan per jin (approximately 0.5 kg) for live pigs, and the wholesale price of fresh meat was 2,400 yuan per jin. The retail price in the vegetable market ranged from 3,000 yuan to 4,000 yuan per jin, depending on the fat content. The large difference between the wholesale and retail prices is because the wholesale price is based on whole pieces with skin and bones, and what the meat vendors lose on the skin and bones must be recovered in the meat price.</p>
<p>Rising meat prices, worry the common people! Conversely, meat merchants should be getting rich. However, talking with them casually reveals that they are also full of complaints. They say: Pigs cannot be hoarded and speculated like gauze and grain to cause market price increases. The reason for the shortage of supply is the real reason. Why is there a shortage of supply? First, because the situation in major producing areas such as northern Jiangsu is unstable, the production of pigs has been affected, and pig dealers are even more reluctant to go. Second, because transportation is difficult, and there are many checkpoints along the way, with difficulties and exactions, further increasing the cost of pig dealers. In addition, the depreciation of the currency and high interest rates, pig merchants seeking profit, they also have to pay labor and expenses, and rising meat prices seem inevitable. So, in a word, even humble things like pigs are closely related to military affairs and politics!</p>

<p>[Reported by This Newspaper] Regarding the disposal of the panda's remains after its death, the New York Zoological Society has sent a cable, instructing that the panda's body still be transported to the United States for dissection in order to study the cause of death and internal structure. However, Dr. Seeley, the medical officer sent by the Zoological Society to China to take care of it, believes that if it is transported to the United States, the journey will take too long, and the body may rot. Therefore, it has been decided to dissect it in Shanghai, which can be done within one or two days.</p>

<p>The Fisheries Group of the Sino-American Agricultural Cooperation Technical Team, in order to revive China's post-war fisheries, is setting off to inspect various coastal areas, so as to refer to the actual situation and provide relief to fishermen. According to Director Tang of the Agricultural Bank of China, who is participating in the inspection, the work of the Fisheries Group in inspecting North China has been completed. After all personnel return to Shanghai, they will depart to inspect the coastal fish-producing areas in South China, as well as Taiwan and Hainan Island, possibly departing at the end of this month. Currently, China's 10 million fishermen have suffered heavy losses during the war, and it is impossible for them to recover on their own after the war. The United States has agreed to donate a large amount of materials for manufacturing fishing gear to our government, which will then be made into tools by the government and distributed to fishermen in various regions. As for the cost of making these fishing gear, it will be facilitated by loans from the China Agricultural Bank. The detailed measures are still under discussion.</p>

<p>[Reported by This Newspaper] The responsible authorities are negotiating with the Allied Headquarters in Tokyo to request the four major Japanese textile machinery manufacturers to rush to build textile machinery for us first, in order to help revive our light industry. It is understood that these four factories had extremely large production volumes before the war, and their OMB textile factories produced products of extremely high quality. During the Pacific War, they were converted into aircraft factories, but they have now been restored to civilian industries. Allied Headquarters has expressed its willingness to give sympathetic consideration to this request, but because Japan currently lacks coal and iron, it is requesting our country to supply these two raw materials. This matter is still under discussion and a decision is pending. Related sources said: Japan currently has 2.4 million spindles in operation, which is equivalent to our country. It is currently impossible to ask Japan to use the textile machinery already in operation as compensation, because General MacArthur's headquarters believes that this move will hinder Japan's trade and employment plans and cause social order to become chaotic.</p>

<p>[Reported by This Newspaper] Since Mayor Wu also took the position of Chairman of the Textile Industry Management Committee, he has decided to convene a full committee meeting at 3 pm tomorrow in the city government meeting room. In addition to the attendance of all committee members, the heads of the industry associations of the 6th District machine textile industry, cotton cloth industry, dyeing and weaving industry, knitwear industry, towel blanket industry, handkerchief industry, and yarn business will also be invited to participate in the meeting.

<p>In addition, the deadline for the Yarn Management Committee to handle the registration of manufacturers of yarn and cloth for Southern transport has passed yesterday. A total of 405 registered distributors and 265 manufacturers (including large factories such as SpinKee, Wing On, and Shen Hsin) were registered. The committee has now dispatched personnel to begin the review and inspect the documents of the manufacturers. Once the review is completed, the qualification review will begin. Qualified applicants will be issued registration cards separately, based on which they can apply. If the number of applications cannot be approved this month, the review will be extended to the next month.</p>

As a result, there was no change compared to the previous close, and Tong Bing fell slightly by 30 yuan.</p>

<p>[Reported by This Newspaper] The Shanghai Timber Trade Association had a large amount of timber requisitioned by the military police during the Shanghai War in 1937. The police bureau requisitioned 16,090 round logs from the association. Ruichang Timber Company requisitioned 120 round logs and 100 pine boards. The 88th Division of the Army requisitioned 279,501 feet of foreign pine from Yuanlong Fuji Timber Company. All of the above requisitions have official receipts from the authorities; and at the time of requisition, they were all promised to be paid at the market price. Later, due to the westward shift of the war, payment was not made in time. The Timber Trade Association has requested compensation from the Joint Logistics Headquarters, but the Logistics Department replied that "the military police unit numbers were not stated separately, and the descriptions in the documents are not detailed enough. After nine years, the units have undergone repeated changes, making it impossible to verify, so it is difficult to handle." The Municipal Chamber of Commerce believes that there must be records available for the requisition of civilian materials by government unit troops and sent a telegram to the Logistics Department yesterday to argue on the basis of reason.</p>

<p>The market for fuel coal, coal briquettes, and other goods has been calm this week, but the market price of firewood continues to rise again. The reason is that the sale of firewood was sluggish before, and few people handled the goods. Recently, due to the frequent rise in coal prices, more people are using firewood, resulting in supply falling short of demand, and market prices rising sharply. According to industry insiders, if the wind direction does not change in the future, then the arrival of goods in early next month of the lunar calendar will be prosperous, and market prices can be expected to fall.</p>

However, the recent rumors that the Central Printing Factory issues 16 million yuan of banknotes per minute are unknown on what basis. He said: The Central Printing Factory is indeed an investment of the Central Bank, but recently four factories have been merged into one. After the business is concentrated, it may be busier than before, but there is absolutely no such a large amount of banknote production. Moreover, the printing machines and paper used by the factory have never been dependent on UNRRA.</p>

<p>[Reported by This Newspaper] After the allocation of rayon, the silk weaving industry expressed satisfaction, because the allocation is made eight times a month, which is equivalent to installment payments, allowing manufacturers to avoid the exploitation of high interest rates. Responsible persons of the association hope that in the future, the China Trust Bureau can directly investigate the factories requesting the allocation of rayon, instead of having the industry association handle it on their behalf. Taking this survey as an example, the association used more than 20 people to survey more than 300 companies, and it is inevitable that it was not precise; if in the future, the China Trust Bureau can conduct strict investigations and handle it fairly, it would be most ideal. In addition, when the representatives of the industry petitioned in Beijing, they negotiated a loan of 33 billion, and the responsible authorities agreed in principle, but the Four Joint Offices put forward two conditions: (1) each member factory needs to go through the procedures separately; (2) the loan must be secured by raw materials and finished products. Because the Four Joint Offices' lending conditions are very strict, only four large factories have been approved for loans. Later, the association proposed another method of contribution, called the public treasury method. All members of the industry association can deliver their raw materials and finished products to the public treasury at a price and request short-term loans at low interest rates. This method has been supported by a tycoon in the financial community and a concrete decision can be expected soon.</p>

According to him, the second batch of seven listed securities and 34 brokers are currently being submitted to the Ministry for approval. As for the matter of "convenient transactions," the Stock Exchange does not have this term.

As for the crackdown on off-exchange trading, it is said to be the responsibility of the administrative authorities, and the Stock Exchange is only in a position to assist.</p>
<h3 id="e136">Bullish Sentiment Wary, Chinese Stocks Sluggish <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>Chinese stocks yesterday experienced renewed financial panic. When the market opened, investor sentiment was low, and all stocks opened significantly lower. After the opening, there was a slight rebound from bargain hunting, but the market atmosphere was already weak. The bulls were like startled birds. Many overnight bulls sold off their positions. Soon, the decline resumed. However, at lower prices, Guangdong merchants and yarn/fabric merchants eagerly bought Yong Yarn. There were small rallies in the middle, but the price of 740 yuan could not be sustained. Under unfavorable circumstances, the bulls were unwilling to linger and gradually liquidated many positions. In addition, No. 88 and other financial firms sold off Yong Yarn, and no one maintained the price. The supply side was eager to sell, finally breaking the 730 yuan level. Near noon, short covering was still strong, but the remnants could not support the price. Yong Yarn presented a seesaw pattern. In Zhongfang, financial firms such as No. 207, No. 88, and No. 232 added a small amount of purchases, which was relatively peaceful. The same was true for Huafeng. As a result, compared with the previous close, Yong Yarn, Maya, Xinhe, and Qinxing each fell by 3-4%, and Jingfu and Xinguang each fell by half a percent. Among the cold stocks, Zhongfang, Datong, Rongfeng, Xinya Company, Liann, Wuhe, and Neiyi slightly declined, and Tongyi Firecrackers each fell by about half a percent. Cement, Huafeng, China Silk, and Jinglun were still stable. The total transaction volume was 7.72 million shares. The rise and fall of various stocks off-exchange were both muted.</p>
<p>Foreign stocks, except for Yeguang Paper, which rose slightly due to a squeeze, many others fell back. As a result, compared with the previous close, British United fell by slightly less than 10%, and Yi Yarn, Jardine Matheson, Yi Beer, and Shipping all fell slightly. Steel, Paper, and Yeguang all rose slightly.</p>

<p>[Report from this newspaper] Japanese returnees reported that the speed of recovery of Japanese industrial production is astonishing. Taking rayon as an example, since August this year, monthly production has reached 50,000 cases, which is 88% of pre-war production. The rayon supplied to our country can be fully delivered by the end of the year to 10,000 cases.

<p>Yesterday, the yarn market suddenly turned prosperous. Because there was a saying that the joint distribution was temporarily suspended, it aroused the attention of all parties. The situation turned better as a result. Nianzhi Special Shuangma rose back to 2.35 million, a rise of 30,000. Other yarns also followed suit, rising by 20,000 to 30,000. Investor sentiment stabilized and seemed to be awaiting special news.</p>

<p>Yesterday was Saturday. Investor sentiment was high because the Central Bank did not sell much gold, and there were more delusions. The market was extremely stable. It opened at 2.205 million in the morning. The low price was no more than 2.2 million. Because investor sentiment was improving, scattered buying came in, and the price gradually rose. However, it was very peaceful at first. After 10 o'clock, the Central Bank allocated 200 bars at a price of 2.205 million. After that, the money market eased, and scattered buying continued to be strong. The price gradually improved. Near noon, it rose to 2.227 million.

<h3 id="e143">General Ge Jingzhong to Fly to Japan to Negotiate Sino-Japanese Cocoon Shipment to China <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Confirmed information: Ge Jingzhong, general manager of China Silk Corporation, and Zou Jingheng, director of the technical department, will soon go to Japan to negotiate with the Allied Headquarters on the shipment of Japanese cocoons to China. It is said that the formalities for going abroad have been completely completed, and they are waiting for a flight to the east. Relevant personnel said that the negotiation on the shipment of Japanese cocoons to China has been going on for a long time. In February this year, China Silk Corporation requested the Allied Headquarters to supply 20 million pounds of Japanese cocoons. At that time, the Headquarters agreed to supply half of the amount, but this decision was overturned by Washington. Later, our country based on the statistics of wartime losses collected by the Executive Yuan, and General Zhu Shiming represented our country to argue reasonably, which led to the incident in September when MacArthur's textile advisor Magana attacked our country's administrative authorities and China Silk Corporation. Later, China Silk Corporation struggled again, and Magana issued a second document attacking our country, with even more fierce language. As a result, Ma was recalled to the country. Now there is a very high hope for the shipment of Japanese cocoons to China, but the quantity has not yet been determined. Ge's trip to Japan hopes to strive for a supply of 10 million pounds, and also hopes to obtain preferential treatment in terms of price. As for the amount of cocoons stored in the silk factories in this city, it varies. The larger ones can be maintained until February or March next spring, and the smaller ones will be difficult to support by the end of this month.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the North and South rice market registered over 10,000 shi of goods. The market sentiment was acceptable, Japonica rice was active, Indica rice was fair, White Yuan and Yin Yuan were stable, and wheat trading was scarce. A large batch of 30,000 packages of Northeast soybeans continuously arrived in Shanghai.

<h3 id="e147">Domestic Wool: Cheap and Coarse, Fine and Soft After Processing <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>Domestic wool can be used for wool spinning and weaving industries and can be quite self-sufficient. The price is also lower. For example, Huzhou wool is 60,000 to 70,000 yuan per dan. After selection and washing, 50 jin of clean wool can be obtained, which can be spun into 40 jin of woolen yarn. Its cost is actually cheaper than Australian woolen yarn. However, the weave is slightly coarse, and various wool spinning factories can only use it for coarse wool fabrics. Fine wool fabrics still rely on Australian goods. Furthermore, because weaving wages are the same for both coarse and fine yarns, coarse goods are slow to sell in the market, and the selling price is also low, while fine goods sell well and the price is also higher. Therefore, most people use Australian woolen yarn to weave fine goods, which leads to domestic wool not being fully utilized. According to research by people in the industry, domestic wool can also be made into the fineness and softness of Australian wool if it can be specially processed, but the current labor costs are high and cannot be realized.</p>
<h3 id="e148">US Cotton Prices Fall for Three Consecutive Days, US Senate Accuses Exchange Manipulation, British Newspaper Says It is Unrelated to President's Broadcast <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>[United Press, New York, 18th] Cotton futures have fallen for the third consecutive day today, a drop of $10 per bale, which has reached the daily maximum price limit, but after the opening, there was a sharp rise of $8.25 at one point. The market believes that the lifting of price controls may cause currency contraction. At the close, futures fell $1.75 to $5.50. In addition, New Orleans, 18th, today cotton futures closed down $3.55 to $5.45 per bale.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Manchester, 18th] The Manchester Guidance newspaper commented that one of the reasons for the recent fall in US cotton prices seems to be a view held by some people that President Truman's broadcast on October 14 foreshadowed the possibility of an early cancellation of cotton fabric price controls. But there is no clear reason to say that the cancellation of control of cotton fabrics is enough to promote the trend of raw cotton market prices, and at the same time, there is no significant reason to believe that the control of cotton fabrics will be cancelled soon. President Truman clearly stated that the control of goods with extremely short supply will continue to be implemented until large-scale production is achieved. From all aspects, the supply of most cotton fabrics in the United States has not been smooth.</p>
<p>[Reuters, New York, 18th] Senator Thomas, chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee, accused the cotton exchange of colluding to suppress cotton prices, which has been denied by the New York and New Orleans cotton exchanges. At the same time, officials from the Department of Agriculture in Washington said that we have not found any attempts to lower cotton prices from all aspects. There is no information available to prove Senator Thomas's accusation. Officials believe that the reason for the fall in cotton prices is nothing more than the law of "what goes up must come down."</p>

<p>At 4 pm yesterday, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce convened the heads of 68 industry associations such as banks, money shops, and chemical industries to continue discussing the method of reporting and paying the profit tax for the 34th year. Xu Jilong, Du Yuesheng, and Pan Shihao of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce attended the meeting. Accountant Xi Yushu also attended and heard about the simplified taxation situation in the Great Rear Area. The leaders of various industries conducted careful research on the reporting and payment methods, and unanimously decided to follow the simplified taxation precedents of the Great Rear Area and increase all amounts reported by each industry by 50%. However, the government originally set the budget for the profit tax for the 34th year in this city at 60 billion. After several consultations by the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, Director Wang came to Shanghai this time, and Du Yuesheng and Xu Jilong repeatedly argued with Director Wang, before he agreed to reduce it appropriately. However, even after the amounts originally reported by various industries were generally increased by 50% as decided, they could only barely reach the full amount of 20 billion. Therefore, both the tax bureau and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce felt difficult about this. As for households that have not reported, the direct tax bureau has already set other methods to severely punish them.</p>

<p>Regarding the recent negotiation concerning the reappointment of Professor Zhu Xu-pin at Jida University, the university was represented by Da Jie, and the faculty was represented by Jian Hua, Yuan Fang, and five others. The course of events differed from what was reported in your newspaper: (1) Although there were some disputes during the negotiation, both parties have reached an understanding after much consultation. The university did not express any admission of error. (2) The appointment of faculty members is entirely determined by the university based on the needs of the curriculum. Among the faculty members who were not reappointed, some were in fact unable to come to Shanghai. Therefore, the faculty provided the university with a list of professors who might be able to accept an appointment in Shanghai. The number of people was fifteen, not twelve.

<h3 id="e178">Visiting Ambassador Stuart's Former Residence <a href="#e178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>— Hangzhou News, 12th, Our Reporter Huang Xing-tian</p>
<p>Dr. Stuart, now in his twilight years, was appointed by President Truman as the U.S. Ambassador to China to discuss national affairs and mediate peace regarding the Kuomintang-Communist conflict. Although peace talks have not yet yielded ideal results, Ambassador Stuart's tireless spirit of working for peace, just like his dedication to nurturing talents as the President of Yenching University from 1918, is deeply and sincerely appreciated by the people of the whole country.</p>
<p>Sweeping Ancestral Graves at Jiulisong</p>
<p>Ambassador Stuart is an American, but he grew up in Hangzhou. It is decided that he will come to Hangzhou on the 18th morning and go to Jiulisong to worship at his parents' graves. Since being hired as a theology teacher at Jinling University in Nanjing in 1907, he has spent most of his time in Peiping for more than thirty years, and rarely visited Hangzhou. After eight years of the War of Resistance, although his hometown can be said to be "unharmed," nostalgia is human nature. Therefore, in the reporter's opinion, it is very necessary for Ambassador Stuart, in an atmosphere where national affairs are still dull, to steal some leisure time to come to the beautiful city of Hangzhou for a few days of quiet life. Shouldn't Dr. Stuart adjust his life and spirit?</p>
<p>Yu Ji-xian Recalls the Past</p>
<p>Ambassador Stuart's former residence is the Jesus Church on Tianhanzhou Bridge in Hangzhou. That road has now been renamed Zhongshan North Road. In Hangzhou, this road is relatively quiet. The appearance of the church is like an ordinary small church, and the exterior is very simple. Ambassador Stuart's "old home" is the middle one of three two-story buildings arranged side by side. Now it is inhabited by Wang Pu-sheng, Ambassador Stuart's top student, who is now the General Secretary of the Hangzhou Christian Youth Association. According to Mr. Yu Ji-xian, an old man of 58 years living there, the house is roughly the same as it was originally, without much change, although it has been more than 30 years. The interior of the house is very exquisite.</p>
<p>The Most Gentle Childhood Life</p>
<p>Seventy years ago (1876), missionary John L. Stuard and his wife Mang Harton Stuard gave birth to their first child, John Leighton Stuart, in this house. Mr. Stuard was originally a teacher and came to China with the spirit of missionary work to dedicate himself to education. Therefore, he opened a primary school. However, church members were very dissatisfied with this, believing that missionary work should precede school management. So the primary school was closed and turned into a church, which is today's Jesus Church still standing next to Zhongshan North Road. At that time, Mr. Stuard's eastern neighbor was a pastor surnamed Hong, and Miss Mai lived on the west side, both of whom were members of the church. Therefore, Mr. Stuart's childhood life was entirely in the air of the church. He traveled with his parents among the Chinese people, learned the language like Chinese children, and also learned to read and write, living the life of ordinary Chinese people. Yu Ji-xian, the only old man in the Jesus Church who can recall the past, can only say that Mr. Stuart was the eldest of three children and also the gentlest. The reporter wanted to inquire about Mr. Stuart's childhood life, but the only answer received was these two words: "gentle."</p>
<p>Thirty Years Since Leaving Hangzhou</p>
<p>Starting at the age of eleven, Mr. Stuart was sent back to his homeland by his family to study. In 1892, he entered Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, where his greatest interests were Latin and Greek. His hope was to become a scholar, a university professor. Hampden-Sydney is a smaller university in the United States that maintains its characteristics. The number of its graduates listed in the Who's Who is higher than that of Harvard University. Dr. Stuart not only left a glorious historical mark in the history of Chinese education, but is now also playing an important supporting role on the American political stage. In November 1904, he married Miss Aline Rodd. In December of the same year, he came to Hangzhou again to live with his father and began to study ancient Chinese literature to replace the study of Latin and Greek. From that time on, he began to understand Chinese culture and further understand many things about China. After preaching in Hangzhou for two years, their only son, Rev. John Stuart, was born. A year later, he was hired as a theology teacher in Nanjing, and from then on, he left Hangzhou and rarely ventured to his second hometown.</p>
<p>Visiting the Old Site, the Lake and Mountains Add Splendor</p>
<p>Ambassador Stuart has been away from his hometown for more than thirty years. The elm tree that he planted himself in the garden of his former residence has grown taller than their building, extending thick and strong branches and lush leaves, protecting their former residence. The coffins of his father and mother are still buried in Jiulisong, Hangzhou. The room he saw when he first came into the world and the room where his wife gave birth to their son, John Stuart, are still intact. Although the furniture in the room has been replaced, the walls and window frames are still the same as they were thirty years ago. According to Mr. Wang Yan-sheng, Ambassador Stuart wrote a letter the other day saying that he had decided to stay in his second hometown for three days, and the Hangzhou Youth Association has been actively preparing to welcome him. Not only will Ambassador Stuart's old friends and acquaintances welcome him, but the people of Hangzhou are also very happy about the coming of this old peace envoy. I believe that Ambassador Stuart's return to his old home will add a new splendor to the scenery of the lake and mountains!</p>
<h3 id="e179">A Groundbreaking Visit: Beijing-Shanghai-Beiping-Kunming Journalist Delegation in Taipei <a href="#e179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>— Taiwan Air Report on the 13th, from Our Correspondent Jiang Muyun</p>
<p>The Beijing-Shanghai-Beiping-Kunming Journalist Taiwan Visitation Group, led by Vice Minister Xu and comprising twenty-two members, landed at Songshan Airport at 10:30 AM on the 12th, crossing the strait. The journalists, hailing from all corners of the country, expressed joy and enthusiasm as they faced the autumn breeze of the island nation on the vast, mountainside-backed airport.</p>
<p>Official Hosts Banquet</p>
<p>Chief Chen specially welcomed and hosted the journalists from afar at the most magnificent First Guest House in Taiwan. After introductions by Group Leader Xu, they gathered around a large rosewood table. The Chief reported on the current situation of the province in a friendly and casual manner, covering the progress in economy, politics, education, and construction. Dressed in a dark blue Zhongshan suit, the Chief appeared energetic and showed great concern and warmth towards the journalists.</p>
<p>After lunch, Chief Editor Chen of this newspaper had a separate meeting with the Chief, answering several questions raised by the Chief Editor. The Chief's banquet was the first event for the journalists upon arrival in Taiwan, and Secretary-General Ge will host a farewell banquet for them in Beitou before their return to Shanghai.</p>
<p>Chairman Speaks Freely About Taiwanese Compatriots</p>
<p>The first event for the journalist delegation that afternoon was a visit to the Provincial Party Headquarters. Chairman Li Shizhong spoke earnestly and sincerely, stating that the cultural level of the Taiwanese compatriots is relatively high, making them receptive to the Party's ideology. They had previously misunderstood freedom and equality and doubted the Three Principles of the People, but they have now made significant progress.</p>
<p>The compatriots are enthusiastic and possess a spontaneous organizational ability. There are many people's organizations, and they all work earnestly and diligently. Generally, those under twenty years old only understand Japanese, while the majority of those over thirty understand Chinese. He cited an example: Lin Xiantang, the head of the delegation who returned from the mainland, is proficient in both literature and poetry. Middle-aged people in the Taichung area can all write Chinese.</p>
<p>"The Taiwanese compatriots who have been oppressed by Japanese imperialism for fifty-eight years have never forgotten their motherland," said Youth League Director Li Youbang, Taipei Mayor You, and Vice Chairman of the Provincial Assembly Li Wanjui to the journalist delegation.</p>
<p>They particularly pointed out the major errors in the remarks made by American journalist Gray, who visited Taiwan for three days. Gray said that if the Taiwanese could vote to choose their master, the first choice would be the United States, the second would be Japan, and the third would be China. Such an observation is an insult to the provincial compatriots. The compatriots have a traditional love for their country and have never forgotten their motherland, and they will never forget their motherland.</p>
<p>Song Feiru, Deputy Director of the Department of Education, representing the provincial compatriots, cited a simple example to illustrate the considerable distance in understanding between the mainland and the island. He said that in a recent middle school entrance exam, the question was "In which province is Kunming located?" and some students answered Zhejiang. Therefore, it is necessary to strengthen the flow of historical and geographical knowledge. However, the mainland also misunderstands the Taiwanese compatriots. For example, when Xie Dongmin, Deputy Director of the Department of Civil Affairs, was in Shanghai, someone asked him if it was true that Taiwanese people had two pairs of horns on their heads. There are many such jokes.</p>
<p>He sincerely hopes that the motherland will not leave the 6.3 million provincial compatriots outside of the 400 million compatriots, as they are eagerly awaiting the love of the motherland.</p>
<p>Speaker of the Assembly Complains</p>
<p>Huang Chaoqin, Speaker of the Provincial Assembly, complained to the journalist delegation. He said that the provincial people expect too much from the Assembly. If a proposal cannot be passed before 12:00 noon, you can see it being criticized in the newspaper at 2:00 PM, and even Assembly members cannot go home because the public will satirize them by blowing and beating Taoist priests as if holding a funeral. Conversely, if a proposal is resolved satisfactorily, they will not hesitate to spend thousands of yuan on advertising fees to publish "thank you notes." In reality, they do not understand the nature of the Assembly, which has no decision-making power.</p>
<p>He recalled the enthusiasm with which the public welcomed the National Army on this day last year. Most of them slept overnight at the train station, waiting for the anti-Japanese soldiers from Fujian, but this scene soon disappointed them.</p>
<p>In terms of employing local talent and factories, he hopes that the government will provide conveniences for the provincial people and give priority to hiring them.</p>
<p>Group Leader Provides News</p>
<p>Group Leader Xu, who is leading the "search for news leads," instead provided news facts to his provincial counterparts at Mayor You's banquet. He succinctly elucidated the situation in wartime news centers such as Chongqing, Chengdu, Kunming, and Guilin, and explained the central government's policy towards the newspaper industry in terms of news administration and reporting techniques. He said that during the war, no newspaper did not comply with news censorship. Now that this system has been abolished and freedom of the press has been restored, this freedom is precious. Reporting should be based on facts, and do not spread rumors or slander, which would destroy freedom. The scope of the news industry is broad, and there are not enough talented people. The significant progress made so far is a fact, but it is not yet ideal, and this requires our own full efforts.</p>
<p>Museum and Democracy</p>
<p>When visiting the museum, the city's first sports meet was being held in the park, and students crowded the square. Some were flipping through books in the library. The journalists were deeply impressed by these second-generation students in tattered clothes and bare feet. The provincial history room in the museum particularly aroused their interest. Chen, the Chief Editor of this newspaper, carefully examined the discussion of the reward silver for the Zhangehua County Magistrate who killed a Japanese general in February of the 24th year of Guangxu and the flag of the Democratic Republic of Shu Jing-song. They all said that this was Taiwan's earliest democracy. Due to Chief Editor Chen's suggestion, everyone gathered together to discuss people's livelihood. After going downstairs, they looked at the locomotive from the Qing Dynasty. As the group strolled leisurely along the stone path, everyone gazed at the autumn clouds in the coconut grove, as if the travelers were already feeling another kind of weariness!</p>
<p>Visiting the Camphor Factory</p>
<p>The last event on the first day in the provincial capital was a visit to the Nanmen Factory, which is the Camphor Factory of the Monopoly Bureau. The factory was shut down for five years before the restoration and has partially resumed production after being taken over. The factory uses the roots, branches, and trunks of both camphor and aromatic camphor trees cut into slices as raw materials, which are then steam-distilled to produce white oil, aromatic oil, and then camphor, terpineol, red oil, green oil, and asphalt. The total production volume this year reached 1,100 tons, and it is expected to increase by 200 tons next year. (The highest annual production in the past was 8 million kilograms.) American artificial camphor seems to have captured the market for natural camphor, but medicine and high-grade fragrances still require the use of natural camphor. Therefore, several British and American companies are directly negotiating purchases, hoping to sell it for $2,000 per ton.</p>
<p>Thinking of the World as One Family</p>
<p>The journalist delegation left Taibei by train at 10:45 AM on the 13th. They will spend four days in central and southern Taiwan, and one day touring Keelung Port. The most prosperous coastal plains of western Taiwan will bear the traces of their sandals. Group Leader Xu decided to convene a symposium of provincial councilors on the evening of the 18th in his capacity as a resident member of the Political Participation Council and broadcast it to the provincial compatriots. Before their scheduled departure from Taiwan on the 19th, there will be a special interlude: preparing to be the officiant at the wedding of Lu Guanqun, the Taiwan special correspondent of the Central Propaganda Department and President of the China Daily.</p>
<p>This reporter went to the airport to welcome Chief Editor Chen of this newspaper and the senior members of the industry. This morning, I waved goodbye as they headed south, deeply feeling that, as H.G. Wells said, the distance on the earth's surface is shortened by the flight of airplanes. He could fly from New York to Siberia to hunt seals and return within 24 hours. This time, the journalists took two and a half hours to get from the Shanghai Bund to Taiwan. The world was originally one family, especially since Taiwan is a newly restored corner. Thinking of this made this reporter feel as if I had already seen the enthusiastic handshake of brothers between the mainland and Taiwan, which should no longer be a distant prospect.</p>
<h3 id="e180">Speaker of the Hunan Provincial Assembly Zhao Yanwu Talks About Li Rui's Military Grain Case <a href="#e180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 18th] Yesterday, after reading a news item from Changsha in the Shanghai Shenbao on the 17th titled "Li Rui's Case of 50,000 Shi of Military Grain," this reporter paid a special visit to Mr. Zhao Yanwu, Speaker of the Hunan Provincial Assembly, to inquire about the details. He stated that the case unfolded as follows:</p>
<p>Hunan Province suffered severe disasters this year, making it difficult to allocate and purchase military grain. After the allocation and purchase was stopped at the end of June, the supply of military grain depended entirely on grain relief from Jiangxi and Guizhou and local procurement. On July 5, the Hunan Grain Administration purchased 10,000 shi of military grain through the Zhongyuan Company. At that time, the grain price in Changsha was still higher than the ordered legal price by 13,500 yuan. On August 2, it purchased another 10,000 shi of military grain through the Production and Business Management Office of the Republic University. At that time, the price of grain on the lakefront had already decreased, but the price ordered by the office was still 13,500 yuan. From the perspective of grain prices, the price was somewhat high. Furthermore, the office owed military grain to the Hunan Supply Bureau of the Joint Logistics Headquarters for June and July. On July 31, the office converted and issued 30,000 shi in gold yuan, which was done in accordance with the telegram order from the Ministry of Food and the Logistics Department, at a rate of 13,500 yuan per shi. (It is said that according to the telegram from the Ministry of Food, each bag could also have an additional 4,000 yuan in transportation costs.) It is said that it was all reported to the provincial government for approval. The Hunan Provincial Assembly raised questions about this case. After Director Li Rui attended the meeting to explain, everyone believed that Director Li was candid in his work and had not committed any illegal acts. However, the handling personnel made mistakes in the handling procedures. The Provincial Government has been requested to investigate and deal with the matter.</p>

<h3 id="e181">Sounds of Lament: Small Ripples in the Shaanxi Provincial Assembly <a href="#e181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>— Xi'an Air Report on the 2nd, from Our Special Correspondent Li Chi</p>
<p>A Peaceful Assembly: The first session of the second meeting of the Shaanxi Provincial Assembly opened on the 15th of last month. After seventeen days of continuous meetings, it officially closed on October 1. More than eighty provincial representatives attended this meeting, and more than four hundred proposals were passed. However, summarizing the impression gained from this meeting, one feels that it "lacks vigor." The agenda of more than half a month proceeded in a relatively "calm" manner, with no "startling" "explosive questions" and no "debates" involving heated arguments. To borrow a familiar journalistic term: "a peaceful assembly," even if there were any, they were only small ripples. However, from the official policy reports at the meeting and the representatives' moderate inquiries, we can still find a lot of news material to supplement the shortcomings of daily newspaper reports.</p>
<p>During the eight years of the Anti-Japanese War, the Japanese army repeatedly attempted to "break into" Shaanxi, but as a result, not an inch of Shaanxi's land fell into enemy hands. This is our good fortune. After the victory, the flames of civil war finally licked into the province from the Central Plains. Li Xiannian's troops of the Chinese Communist Party entered southern Shaanxi from Henan in late July. According to the news at that time, the conflict area was limited to four or five counties in the Shangnan and Longjuzhai area. Furthermore, since about mid-August, the newspapers here have not disclosed any records regarding this issue. The following report from the security authorities to the Provincial Assembly is the first disclosure and is worthy of attention.</p>
<p>Security and Relief: Dai Guimao, Commander of the Shaanxi Provincial Security Headquarters, said in his report: "The Communist army led by Li Xiannian infiltrated Shaanxi Province on July 15 this year, and infiltrated Huating, Gansu on August 25. Twenty counties in this province were ravaged." Also, "There are currently more than 10,000 people on the western suburbs highway."</p>
<p>Zhu Shaozhou, Chairman of Shaanxi Province, also mentioned in his policy report: "Li Xiannian's troops in northern Hubei and Wang Shusheng's troops entered the Shangnan and Zhenping counties of this province from the border between Henan and Hubei on July 15... Wang Shusheng's troops were blocked and retreated back to Hubei Province in August. Li Xiannian's troops, which harassed everywhere, were also blocked and dispersed. The First War Zone Headquarters has drafted a whole set of treatment methods for the remnant bandits..."</p>
<p>Judging from the above two reports, the Communist army's intrusion into Shaanxi Province this time is still an issue that has not been completely resolved. The Shaanxi Security Headquarters also announced: "The Communist army that infiltrated Baihe advanced to harass the county seat of Zhen'an last week. They were jointly suppressed by local teams and the public and were defeated on September 26..." For current urgent issues, please refer to the "Emergency Relief Measures for Bandit-Affected Areas" recently passed by the provincial government. It states that the counties most severely affected include Shanyang, Zhen'an, Weinan, and Shangxian. Counties that have been repeatedly affected include Shangnan, Zhashui, Ningshan, Foping, and Longyou. The less affected counties include Liuba, Yangxian, and Longxian. Representatives from southern Shaanxi in this meeting of the Provincial Assembly have repeatedly appealed for the people in that area.</p>
<p>Hail Kills Cattle: The people of Shaanxi Province are suffering from natural disasters in addition to man-made disasters! According to the report by Chen Guting, Director of the Department of Social Affairs, to the Shaanxi Provincial Assembly: "Twenty-two counties in this province reported spring disasters, and seven counties reported summer disasters. Relief wheat and relief funds have been issued. In addition, seven counties reported summer disasters and thirty-one counties reported autumn disasters." Although the provincial government has been providing various forms of relief based on the basic principle of "giving more and taking less," the burden on the people is still heavy. Please listen to the appeal of a representative from Shangxian: "150,000 people in Shangxian are living surrounded by "disasters" and "bandits." The public expenses allocated to the people are more than 780 million yuan. This year, Shangxian was hit by hail, which was so big that it killed cattle!..."</p>
<p>Collection of Actual Grain: Regarding the issue of this year's collection of actual grain and borrowing, the Provincial Assembly has made an important decision. The government's planned figures are 1.2 million city shi for both collection of actual grain and borrowing, plus 30% of provincial and county-level public grain, which is 360,000 city shi. This number is about 1.6 million city shi less than the borrowing of grain in previous years. The Provincial Assembly hopes that: "The additional 100% of the land tax, the 50% that has not been collected in this province this year, should still be exempted. The item of borrowing should follow the previous practice of "collecting one and borrowing half" and should not be increased." The assembly also telegraphed the authorities, requesting that 8.5/10 of the grain warehouse vouchers be returned to the local area, and the remaining 1.5/10 be used for subsidizing educational equipment and other expenses. According to the decision of the National Finance and Food Conference in June of this year, the provincial government only gets 20% of the amount of land tax collected in kind, while the county-level can get 50%. Of the 12-13 billion yuan of expenditures that have been approved in the Shaanxi provincial government's budget for the second half of this year, the reliable income is only more than 3 billion yuan. This "deficit" of nearly 10 billion yuan is a terrible number. It is said that according to regulations, during these six months, the provincial government can request the central government to allocate administrative expenses, but not for more than three months. The Director of the Finance Department, who recently returned to Shaanxi from the capital, told reporters that the central government has allocated more than 3 billion yuan in subsidies for July, August, and September, and another 1 billion yuan is for subsidizing the collection of taxes that did not reach the expected figures. The statement of financial revenue and expenditure for the second half of the year is still under review in Nanjing. The shortfall will probably be made up by subsidies from the central government.</p>
<p>Despite the provincial government's books showing such a huge "deficit," the authorities still have the courage to design and formulate long-term and large-scale construction plans, extending them to six years if five years are not enough, aiming to complete them from this year to 1951. This preliminary draft has been submitted to the current Provincial Assembly for review.</p>
<p>The Shaanxi Provincial Bank and the Longhai Railway Bureau have been criticized by the Provincial Assembly. The former is about its business dealings, and the latter is due to the recent shortage of train cars, which has led to the rising prices of coal, yarn, and flour. The Railway Bureau seems to have shown signs of accepting friendly suggestions recently.</p>
<p>Armed Drug Trafficking: Finally, I want to mention the Shaanxi Province's drug ban problem, which I originally intended to omit. According to official estimates, there are a total of 100,000 opium addicts in Shaanxi Province. Therefore, banning drugs in Shaanxi Province is indeed a difficult problem. It is said that a large amount of opium is being smuggled in a certain area, but the actual situation has yet to be confirmed. Officials also revealed for the first time at this assembly that opium seedlings were once discovered on the border between Sichuan and Shaanxi this spring.</p>
<p>"Armed drug trafficking" is not uncommon in Shaanxi Province. According to the Director of the Department of Civil Affairs in his report at the meeting: From January to July, force was used to investigate and arrest drug traffickers, resulting in "combat" (these two words are quoted from the original text) on 82 occasions! More than 5,000 taels of opium have been seized! According to another report by Chairman Zhu, a total of more than 1,100 drug offenders were investigated and arrested from January to August, and the weapons seized from drug traffickers included 7 rifles, 4 machine guns, 54 pistols, and 42 hand grenades. In addition, there were also some opium,赃款, gold, and silver. The Security Command supplemented the report of the Department of Civil Affairs, saying that in the same period, more than 1,000 taels of opium and more than 600,000 yuan of drug money were seized.</p>
<p>The Shaanxi Provincial Government has decided to force all opium addicts to quit smoking within three months starting from November this year, and has prepared more than 100 million yuan and several thousand taels of opium as the consumption for the implementation of the drug ban. If it can be completed smoothly as scheduled, it will of course be a supreme virtue. However, the effectiveness of all policy plans is ultimately determined by the lowest-level implementers, which is especially obvious in the case of the drug ban. Li Mengbiao, Deputy Speaker of the Assembly, said on the day of the closing ceremony, "May the words of the members of this Assembly be likened to 'the sounds of lament,' hoping that there will be a day when their wishes are fulfilled."</p>

<h3 id="e182">Condolences to Comrades of the New China Drama Society <a href="#e182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>— Xiao Liang</p>
<p>It is reported that more than 30 members of the New China Drama Society and several members of the Yunnan Education Drama Troupe, who were leaving Kunming for Shanghai on a relief vehicle, had a car accident near Guanlingchang in Guiyang, resulting in 27 deaths and injuries. This is truly a loss for the drama community!</p>
<p>The New China Drama Society was established in Guilin, and most of its members were young people who loved art. They were energetic and studied diligently, but they encountered many setbacks due to the lack of funds and obstacles. Later, they performed in various places in Xiangtan and Hengyang, and received the welcome and help of local people, and the society's affairs made progress. Later, due to the drastic changes in the Xianggui War, they wandered to Kunming, a rear area that was an excellent professional drama troupe.</p>
<p>When Guilin held the first drama exhibition, "New China" returned with honor and participated in the performance. At that time, they could be said to be very popular, but they still lived a disciplined life, without being infected with any bad habits. All the members lived a life of art above all else, and the economy was open. All the money besides living expenses was used to develop the society, and the future was limitless!</p>
<p>Now that victory has been restored and they are repatriated, they came to Shanghai from Kunming, but unfortunately suffered a car accident on the way. This is truly a loss for the drama community and a loss for the cultural community!</p>
<p>I hope that the surviving members will continue to work hard and live up to the expectations of those comrades who sacrificed for art!</p>
<h3 id="e183">A Record of the Peking Opera Symposium <a href="#e183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>— Zhao Jingshen</p>
<p>The Peking Opera symposium convened by Tian Han and Zhou Xinfang, recorded by Wang Dingcheng, has been published simultaneously in the monthly magazine and the Frontline Daily. What he recorded were all important words, and I will talk about the trivial matters at that time.</p>
<p>Everyone unanimously requested Guo Moruo to speak first. He could not refuse, so he stood up with a smile. His first sentence was: "Everyone is curious!" Then, everyone laughed. His meaning seemed to be that he was an outsider to Peking Opera, "You insiders (such as Zhou Xinfang, Gao Baishi, Li Ruilai, Lu Junqiao, Jiang Chunfang, etc.) want to hear what an outsider has to say." Later, he said that Peking Opera music seemed to lack harmony.</p>
<p>Zheng Zhenduo talked about facial makeup, saying that when he was in Europe, once in England, he was walking on the lawn in a garden and saw many terrible little heads on the glass window of a house. The faces all had colorful patterns. Later, he realized that these were all barbarians who had been killed, and the heads had become smaller because they had been soaked in medicine.</p>
<p>Pan Zhinong's talk about Sichuan Opera facial makeup was also very interesting. He said that the Green Snake in Sichuan Opera was originally a man, so he dressed up as a male character. During the drinking of realgar wine, there is a "face changing" performance. After the meeting, I said to Moruo that this was a bit like Robert Louis Stevenson's "Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde."</p>
<p>Wu Renzhi's words were short but reasonable. He said: "Peking Opera often has many self-expressions or show-offs that are irrelevant to the plot, such as the swordsmanship of martial artists. These should all be given up without fear of pain. It must be something that should be in the plot before it can be put in, otherwise it will become a performance, not acting."</p>
<p>Tian Han's idea is quite strange. Ouyang Yuqian said before that the rotation of many wheel flags in a row can represent the rotation of machinery. Now Tian Han said that cars and motorcycles can be painted on the flags as cars, or the leaves of airplanes as airplanes.</p>
<p>Chen Zhiliang said that many of the Peking Opera scripts revised by the Ministry of Education have been published and can be used as good references.</p>
<p>Tian Han and Zhou Xinfang convened another meeting at the Red Cotton Restaurant on June 21. This meeting was just to prepare for the publication of publications and to solicit drafts from friends. However, Zhou Xinfang talked about two movements in performing techniques that were also quite interesting.</p>
<p>He said that when performing old men and old women, they often bend over and cup their buttocks. In fact, they should bend over and stick out their chests, and the buttocks must not be cupped. It is not easy to practice this skill.</p>
<p>He also talked about Xu Lingyun, a Kunqu opera performer, talking about the blind man in the fortune-telling scene in "The Story of the Red Plum Blossom." Most people perform the blind man by walking on the stage with a bamboo cane, tapping the ground step by step. But in reality, it is not like that. Since the blind man has no eyes, he relies entirely on his ears, so he should step onto the stage sideways, listen with his ears, and maybe his mouth will also be crooked to one side. He made that movement, which was very funny.</p>
<p>Later, they talked about Dai Ailian's "Deaf-Mute Carrying a Madman," where one person plays two people. Some people said that this is the same as a Shandong person playing two people fighting.</p>
<p>Xinfang said: "The deaf-mute carrying a madman in Peking Opera is actually an old man carrying a young man. One hand is used as the head of the old man, and the other hand is the left hand of the woman. The old man turns his head to look at the girl, and the girl slaps him in the face."</p>
<p>Tian Han said: "Guilin Opera is different. The old man is chased by a group of idlers. One hand is holding the old man's fake head, and the other hand is the old man's left hand. He turns his head to look at the people chasing him, and shakes his hand to tell them not to chase him, and then uses his hand to wipe away tears."</p>
<p>The above records are based on memory only. I did not take notes at the time, so there may be errors, for which I am responsible.</p>
<h3 id="e184">Audiences in Beijing and Shanghai Watch The Unofficial History of the Qing Dynasty Together <a href="#e184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>— Hua Fen</p>
<p>The appearance of "The Unofficial History of the Qing Dynasty" has probably caused a sensation among opera fans in Shanghai! However, do opera fans in Shanghai know that it had already fascinated opera fans in Chongqing before the victory. Because of it, people waited early in the morning at the "Kangjian Hall" to buy tickets, and our Chairman was also mobilized to watch it and invited all the actors to the Lizhi Society. Yang Cunbin was also summoned by the Chairman at that time and comforted him in person.</p>
<p>The government was repatriated, the people were repatriated, and "The Unofficial History of the Qing Dynasty" also followed the actors to Shanghai. After several months of preparation and rehearsal, the "Audience Performing Company" used it as its first play. The director was still Yang Cunbin, and the actors were the first-class: Geng Zhen, Shen Yang, Ye Zi, Yang Hua, Zhang Yan, Wen Xiying, etc. "Zhongwan" also wanted to perform "The Unofficial History of the Qing Dynasty," and Yang Cunbin had no choice but to agree, but on one condition: Zhongwan had to perform in Nanjing first. Everyone agreed, so Yang Cunbin started to get busy. It was not easy to put the play of "Audience" on the stage in Lafai, and after he watched the first performance, Wang Ruilin immediately pulled him to Nanjing.</p>
<p>"Zhongwan" performed "The Unofficial History of the Qing Dynasty" in Nanjing. All the actors and the head of the troupe, Wang Ruilin, and the director, Yang Cunbin, arrived. Not long ago, it was performed at the National Grand Theater in Nanjing, and it was decided to perform for ten consecutive days. The actors included Shu Xiuwen, Tao Jin, Chen Tianguo, Ruan Fei, Kou Jiabi, Qian Qianli, etc., all of whom were excellent actors. Compared with the "Audience" in Shanghai, they each had their own merits.</p>
<h3 id="e185">伊黛露碧諾受窘 <a href="#e185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>— 朱曾汶</p>
<p>Don't let 伊黛露碧諾's small stature and seemingly young age fool you, on February 4th of next year, she will be celebrating her thirtieth birthday.</p>
<p>伊黛 smiles warmly, speaks capriciously, and loves to tell a joke about herself that happened in her birthplace of London. Although 伊黛 went to the United States at the age of thirteen, before the war, she would return to her father's theatrical birthplace every year to show that she did not forget her homeland and the kindness of her family's upbringing. One year, after she and her sister returned to London, they suddenly wanted to go see a movie. Coincidentally, the theater they went to had just shown a film starring her the previous week. As their car approached the theater, they saw that the front was crowded with people, so packed that not a drop of water could seep through. 伊黛 said to her sister, "My film must have done well when it premiered here last week. Look, they're all here to welcome me." But who leaked the news of her visit to England? She wrongly accused her sister of being the culprit, but her sister flatly denied it. At this moment, 伊黛 caught sight of a red carpet laid at the entrance of the theater, and she exclaimed, "Everyone in London must know I'm here." After she got out of the car, she put on her best demeanor, bowing to the crowd as she prepared to enter the theater, but just then, she heard a London policeman behind her shout loudly, "Ladies, please move forward quickly, the Prince of England is about to arrive."</p>
<p>Needless to say, 伊黛's face was as red as a pig's liver at that moment, but she still dares to tell people about it today, which shows that she has a pure heart and the courage to admit her mistakes!</p>

<p>— 楊灝</p>
<p>Actors are the main part of a performance. Through actors, the playwright can specifically express his thoughts to the audience. Moreover, actors are in direct contact with the audience. Therefore, the quality of the performance is determined, and the actor's contribution is very important. In this performance, the actors showed a characteristic, that is, generally speaking, it is very balanced, and they maintained a good style. They do not specially express themselves on the stage, or make gimmicks to attract attention. They all obey the performance and cooperate very well.</p>
<p>葉子　葉子's Empress Dowager Cixi is very important in this play. Almost the entire "Unofficial History of the Qing Palace" revolves around her, using her as the main line. Her quality is crucial to the entire performance. 葉子 portrays this character deeply and vividly. Her every move, every word, and every smile is enough to stir the audience's heartstrings, showing that she has put in a lot of effort, and she performs so skillfully that I feel like I am in the Qing Dynasty more than fifty years ago, and I can get a glimpse of this female ruler who dominated the world and China, and I am a little afraid of her power. Cixi is a person with a strong sense of self-confidence. There is very little expression of original and true emotions in her life, so her mood is very lonely. She wants to find happiness, she likes to talk, likes to laugh, and likes excitement, but she may not directly participate in these scenes. She may just like to hear people talk, like to watch people laugh, and from people's talk and laughter; she may find warmth and sweep away loneliness. (For example, Cixi's lines: "...Today we don't stick to etiquette, the more those who can talk and laugh, the more I like..." - Act II) But 葉子 will let her character laugh heartily, so sharply, it seems a bit frivolous and not in line with the identity and mood of her character.</p>
<p>耿震　耿震's Emperor Guangxu is the most pitiful emperor of the Qing Dynasty. This is a so-called "positive" character, but the playwright seems to be far less vivid in handling this kind of positive character than he is in handling special characters. In the script itself, Guangxu is a bit flat, with very few ups and downs. Therefore, this character is more difficult to play. 耿震 is a good actor. He does not add anything extra to this character, but simply and dutifully expresses everything that is given to him and asked of him in the script, so that we sigh, pity, sympathize, and are angry for this weak emperor.</p>
<p>陽華's Li Lianying is the biggest and most superficial "villain" in the entire play. The script gives this character a lot of richness. 陽華 plays this character very appropriately. He flatters, is humble, insidious, and vicious, portraying a character with both an ugly appearance and personality, almost making us feel that he is a terrible shadow lurking behind the Qing Dynasty. 陽華 is a talented actor, but when the play is in progress and after the play is over, we always feel that his performance is not very coordinated with the whole, and it always seems like there is something extra, that is, some places are slightly excessive. If he can restrain these excessive places a little, then his performance can be said to be very outstanding.</p>
<p>沈揚　沈揚's Kou Liancai is the most vivid. A naive, simple, ignorant of the immensity of heaven and earth, and loyal and righteous character. He plays him so vividly that he wins the audience's applause, laughter, respect, and tears, and even more admiration for his acting skills.</p>
<p>翁同龢, the emperor's teacher, a learned, arrogant, and stubborn old man, 张雁 plays him very well, especially when he argues with Li Hongzhang until his face turns red and he makes a passionate speech in front of the Empress Dowager, with sound and color. In creating the appearance of the character, people will know at first glance that this is an old man with a strong sense of self-confidence and stubbornness.</p>
<p>Li Hongzhang, the representative of the emerging comprador class at that time, a speculator, a double-dealer, was eventually attacked in embarrassment and abandoned. This character is very difficult to play, but 温锡莹 handles it in an orderly manner, neither humble nor overbearing, which is indeed in line with his "Doctrine of the Mean" that he always advocates.</p>
<p>楊戳's Consort Zhen, 冀淑平's Consort Jin, 傅惠珍's Sister Li, and 莫愁's Empress all performed wonderfully, but the script gives them too little. For example, the playwright's handling of Consort Zhen is far inferior to that of Sister Li. Sometimes we really can't figure out how Consort Zhen would have gained the emperor's favor and her influence on the emperor. Of course, the actors have no way to give this character more content.</p>

<p>— 馬博良</p>
<p>Lucky Mr.</p>
<p>Perhaps it is a kind of love style in the United States. "A Social Celebrity's Love Affairs", "New Life", "Albizia Flowers", and even this "Lucky Mr." all have the same center: a rich man's daughter falls in love with a poor man. The dreams of people living in a capitalist society, through the mouth of a gambler, the screenwriter happily rebukes the marriage of class. Golden branches and jade leaves have to submit. Tie my tie for me, she stood on the stairs and obeyed the orders of love. Aren't all those who walk alone with crooked ties hoping for this luck? The original intention of this film is not like "Three Musketeers", but it creates a lot of lighthearted jokes, natural, unexaggerated, and smooth. Waiting and talking at the blood transfusion place, lightly like a jumping curve. The scene of being forced to learn velvet thread is comical and abrupt, unconventional, and makes people can't help but smile. Director Bode is a newcomer, with a novel approach. The words at the beginning of the pier are old, and the story is opened with two doors, and the story is closed with the closing of two doors at the end. Some people don't like the happy ending and advocate letting it become a melancholy tragedy. However, I feel that the rich woman's tracking at the pier is a bit cruel. Therefore, the sweet kiss in the mist after suffering is exactly what we expect on behalf of her. The regret is that the gambler's nature of being a jerk has not been fully expressed, and he still retains the true character of a bad egg, not enough to be the rich lady's lover. Secondly, "Lucky Mr." has not developed into a pure comedy, losing more opportunities for satire.</p>
<p>卡萊憂倫 plays the gambler, naturally manipulating freely, but not as good as 嚴若遊龍 in "Crazy Family". "Crazy Family" is his highest peak in comedy. 拉琳黛風徽　however, is charming and elegant, showing the same level of skill in expressing shrewd and capable character and affectionate charm. I really like her bright smile, gaze, and stare, combining both Cute and Chie.</p>
<p>Daughter City</p>
<p>This is an exposure-based social film, not a comedy. What we see is the society of an American small town with the false skin peeled off. There are very potential themes, but unfortunately it lacks wonderful organization. Director Sidney Salkow should receive mixed reviews. His glory is his handling of the women's apartment. A group of women are working hard and patiently waiting for their relatives to be released from prison and return. The whistle is a sign of prisoners entering the meal, but the bell is a sign of the execution of their own flesh and blood. On a rainy day, faces with tear stains on the glass window, they are dreaming, expecting, and waiting in withering time. These depressing scenes are good enough, and everything else is superfluous. The actors each have their own merits and portray a kind of personality on their own. The heroine, 林達黛妮兒, is usually dazzling and charming, and her acting skills are slightly inferior in serious dramas compared to villainous dramas.</p>
<h3 id="e189">林黛達妮兒主演「女兒城」 <a href="#e189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>Phantom of the Opera</p>
<p>Some say that the story of China's "Midnight Song" is derived from this. It tells the horror story of perverted artists, which is the same as Man's 奥白朗乔治山德士's "Broken Blossoms" and 林達黛妮兒's "Mad Artist". But the photographic atmosphere and director of photography are better in the latter two. 納爾遜埃第's singing voice is still strong, but unfortunately what he sings is not English opera, which is difficult to appreciate. It is better to pay attention to the installation and the mysterious masked ball at the end. After all, this is an award-winning film.</p>

<h3 id="e190">送友人留學英國序 <a href="#e190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>— 徐仲年</p>
<p>On the morning of October 17th, in the thirty-fifth year of the Republic of China, Ms. Zhang Qianying, Mr. Zhang Anzhi, Mr. Chen Xiaonan, and Mr. Fei Chengwu will take a plane to study in England: this is a very gratifying thing! On the one hand, we congratulate the Ministry of Education for selecting talented people: they graduated from National Central University in their early years, and they are all proud students of Mr. Xu Beihong. Among them, the earliest graduated in June of the twentieth year of the Republic of China, and the latest was in January of the twenty-fifth year of the Republic of China: that is to say, it has been at least ten years and ten months since graduation! During this long period of time, their efforts have aroused social attention, stimulated sympathy in the art world, and laid the foundation for their own academic status. On the other hand, we cannot but admit that they are lucky: at this time when the country is in trouble and academics are declining, Chinese culture has reached the point of suffocation, they actually have the opportunity to study abroad, not only will the air they breathe be fresh and pure, without the stench of money, without the corrupt smell of negativity, but they will also be able to appreciate the works they love to appreciate and learn the art they love to learn. Compared with us, the so-called cultural people, staying in the motherland, wanting to make progress but the environment does not allow us to make progress, there is a real difference between heaven and earth!</p>
<p>Or someone said: modern China only needs science, not art. This view is no different from saying: the most important thing for a person is matter, and spirit is secondary. First of all, I doubt whether science can develop without spirit? Even if it is possible, is the abnormal progress of material civilization the happiness of mankind? In terms of skills, art is science; in terms of spirit, the object of art is the soul. Between materialism and idealism, art gives us a kind of adjustment: so art is positive, not negative; it is a necessity, not a luxury. Don't say: "Build the country with art": relying on art alone is not enough to build the country; however, building the country while ignoring art, or even kicking art away, the country built in this way only has a shell, not a soul! This means that your responsibilities are heavy, and it also means that your future is bright.</p>
<p>Since the object of art is the soul, it of course also refers to "people" and "me". Artists use their works to move people and beautify life. However, artists themselves must first cultivate an inner power of emotion, a magnetic force that cannot be seen with the naked eye. If you want to cultivate this magnetic force, this power of emotion, relying on superficial skills alone is not enough, you must enrich your own soul and elevate your own soul. Among the artists in contemporary China, - I am only referring to oil painters, because although the four of you paint both Chinese and Western, until now, the main thing is still Western painting, - there are many people with superb skills, but unfortunately there are more people with "empty bellies"! A belly full of poetry and books makes one's temperament naturally beautiful: does it only refer to writers? No! Artists are also like this. Enriching the soul and elevating the soul depends on reading widely. A person who is gorgeously dressed but speaks vulgarly: what do we call him? We call him a "nouveau riche"! A person who is skilled in technique, but when he paints, he lacks elegance and has no content: what do we call him? We call him a "craftsman"! If you only know how to paint, do not seek to broaden your knowledge, and do not use the excellent academic environment of foreign countries to dabble in literature, philosophy, or even music, to cultivate your character and cultivate your emotions, you will only have superficial achievements, and your works will have no soul. To put it bluntly: among your teachers and friends, there are too many good-for-nothings, and there is no need to add four more of you!</p>
<p>You are students of Beihong. From the perspective of Chinese critics (?) who like to give people "hats", you should be listed in the academic school. In their opinion, the academic school symbolizes backwardness. What they worship are the futurists, cubists, Dadaists, and fauvists. However, they do not know that long before World War II, these schools that appeared between 1910 and 1917 were already out of date. The academic school still exists prominently. For example, when practicing writing, you might as well start with "Jiucheng Palace", lay a good foundation, and then seek change: the academic school is the "Jiucheng Palace" of art. What's more, new masters like Picasso are thorough academics when they practice. Learning only asks for the orthodox, not for fashion: make up your own mind, stand firm; don't be a weathercock, turning with the wind in all directions!</p>
<p>Since I have mentioned the academic school, futurists, etc., I advise you: to learn art, France and Italy are not to be missed: these two countries are really superior to England in terms of art. Italy is the stronghold of the classical school and the birthplace of the futurists; and Paris, the capital of France, is inclusive and magnificent! However, I have to say again that it is not that you cannot learn anything in England. It is enough for you to learn! Enough! However, lay a good foundation in England, - no, strengthen your already good foundation, - and then go to France and Italy to broaden your horizons. What's more, in Paris, you can meet Ms. Pan Yuliang, your teacher and my friend, who has been abroad for more than twenty years!</p>
<p>You are preparing to stay in the UK for two years, even if it is a long term, it will only be four years: the time is too short, you must work harder to live up to the country, live up to Beihong, and live up to yourselves! However, when I said goodbye to you this afternoon, you were all rosy-cheeked and healthy. I hope you are like this when you go abroad, and like this when you return! Do I need to recite to you: "Work while you work, play while you play: this is the road to success and happiness"? Furthermore, I have a few words to especially exhort Anzhi, Xiaonan, and Chengwu: in London, Paris, Rome, and in other major cities in Europe, there are too many opportunities to play, especially in terms of female beauty. Among the students studying abroad, there are often people who spoil their bodies. Although I like to eat pig knuckles, I don't want to eat cold pig head meat with holes: so my exhortation is not about morality, - France said: "Why put morality so low?" - but based on my health-first doctrine! What is the use of good knowledge if a person is not healthy?</p>
<p>Back then, the emperor of the Tang Dynasty personally sent Sanzang abroad to seek scriptures, toasted the Dharma Master with a cup of wine, and suddenly grabbed a handful of yellow soil and put it in the wine, hoping that Sanzang would not forget his hometown after drinking it. Although this is the head of the history of the drama, it is very meaningful. You are Chinese: even if the current China is in great chaos, the motherland is still the motherland, the moon is good in England, but the moon in China is even better! You must not forget your motherland, forget your teacher, forget your relatives and friends, and... forget your mission!</p>

<p>The Greatest War Correspondent: Ernie Pyle</p>
<p>— Zhang Yinhuai</p>
<p>Thousands upon thousands of unnamed soldiers fall one after another on the battlefield, braving bullets and shedding hot blood, in exchange for victory after victory. Their war exploits, like the pyramids of Egypt, will forever be recorded in history, but their lives are like the rocks that make up the pyramids, or even like the grains of sand beside the pyramids, never to be mentioned by anyone.</p>
<p>Only Ernie Pyle, wearing a light brown war correspondent uniform full of wrinkles and oil stains, dragging his short and never-tiring body, followed the army from North Africa to Sicily, from Normandy to Okinawa, reporting to the whole world the joys and hardships of the daily lives of the small soldiers, and the bravery of killing enemies on the front line, in a cordial and moving way, so that they will always be imprinted in people's hearts.</p>
<p>Ernie Pyle and his dog</p>
<p>Ernie was a peace-loving man who hated war. But he also loved freedom more, and understood that this was a war that had to be fought hard for freedom. From this point of view, he was the person who understood the small soldiers the most. He ate the same rough and monotonous food as the soldiers, slept in the muddy trenches at night, and deeply experienced the joys and pains, bravery and cowardice of the small soldiers. With his sympathetic and moving tone, he wrote about the tense but ordinary combat life. Ernie was not a hero, so the protagonists in his writing were not legendary heroes, but ordinary people like you and me, with flesh and blood, with the desire to live and the fear of death - his sympathetic and compassionate tone finally shook the hearts of millions of people in the rear, and won the warm love of the nameless people who fought hard on the front line.</p>
<p>As for the generals' wars, Ernie left them to the reporters who wrote the number one headlines. Ernie's war was the kind of war that was different from the generals' war.</p>
<p>The famous American novelist John Steinbeck, author of "The Grapes of Wrath" and "The Moon Is Down", said: "There are two kinds of wars that do not interfere with each other. Terrain, strategy, firepower, rear service, troop movements, all that is the generals' war. Secondly, it is the war against homesickness, against fatigue, sarcasm, rudeness, and complaining about food - that is Ernie Pyle's war. He knew everything that people knew about these things, but he wrote better than anyone else."</p>
<p>Ernie was a humble, thrifty, and not very talkative person. His original name was Ernest Pyle. He was born in Indiana, USA, in 1900. He studied journalism at Indiana State University. After graduation, he worked in several newspapers. It was not until after the attack on Pearl Harbor that he leaped to become the most famous and most loved war correspondent in the United States. He often went in and out of the front lines. He traveled with the US military throughout North Africa, entered Sicily, crossed the sea and landed in Italy, and then returned to England to watch them bomb the Nazis and prepare to invade the mainland. In June 1944, he followed the army again, landed in Normandy, drove straight in, and marched into Paris.</p>
<p>In these three or four years, Ernie's daily war correspondence was opened as a special column for 366 newspapers in the United States, and 310 weekly magazines reprinted it. The total number of readers was more than 12,255,000. These correspondences were compiled and published into two collections: "Here Is Your War" and "Brave Men". The former sold 940,000 copies, and the latter sold 860,000 copies. Until now, these numbers are still increasing every moment.</p>
<p>In early 1945, he came to the Pacific with the Navy. He witnessed the capture of Okinawa Island on an aircraft carrier. He was always on the front lines. But misfortune began. On the morning of April 18, Ernie was hit by a Japanese machine gun bullet on the front line of Iwo Jima and was seriously injured. He died on the same day at 10:15 am.</p>
<p>Ernie died. He died on the front line, one mile away from the forward command post. Some unfinished drafts were still hidden in his baggage: "The Last Chapter". These chapters, sections, sentences, and words were all records exchanged for life, leaving a lasting and cordial statue for the tens of thousands of brave men who fought silently and died silently.</p>

<h3 id="e194">Where is Youth? <a href="#e194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>— Xie Zi</p>
<p>Among the popular songs, there's one called "Where is Youth?" I have a fondness for this song. When listening to it, I can imagine the composer's state of mind. The lyrics are affirmative, but the melody is negative, and the singing even more so. The clumsy and forced lyrics are overshadowed by the melody and the voice, and what we hear is not an affirmative whole, but rather fragmented elegies of sorrow: the autumn wind, the autumn flowers, blowing gently, quietly withering, everything seems to be in autumn—a lingering and sorrowful autumn song! Youth has withered in the autumn wind and rain, leaving only a faint lingering fragrance in the damp, yellow-green fallen leaves.</p>
<p>I'm reminded of another picture I saw, an illustration for a short story titled "When Young." In the picture, there's a small tree, a tree of life, the sun shining on its leaves, shimmering with silver light. Next to the tree is a young girl,踮着脚, reaching forward, trying to reach the tree. She's wearing thin clothes, light and graceful. The dazzling sunlight and the morning mist intertwine—a symbol of youth full of hope. But when you read the story, the content is negating. After reading the story and looking at the illustration again, it feels like an elegy as well: a recollection of a lost youth.</p>
<p>So I think: a perfect youth is almost impossible to exist in the human heart. In any case, there's always some imperfection. If the waning moon and the fading flowers are a sorrowful thing, then a full moon and flourishing flowers can still be seen often. But a perfect and flawless youth is almost impossible to find, even with a lantern.</p>
<p>Perhaps, maybe it can be found in the hearts of those who are ignorant and carefree. However, without reflection and understanding, it can only be complete, not perfect. With reflection and understanding, even if it's still perfect, that perfection is just like the moon: in the moon, there are dark shadows called laurel trees.</p>
<p>These shadows sometimes obscure the radiance of youth, just like the sorrowful melody overshadows an affirmative lyrics, making it look a little confused.</p>
<p>Where is youth? Where is youth? It seems unnecessary to ask. We can see many twinkling and glittering stars of youth, but we will never see a perfect moon of youth without shadows.</p>

<p>— Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>"You two, are you students? Are you catching the train?" He pointed to the steamed buns on the table and said, "You're hungry. These buns aren't good to eat." He looked us up and down again and said, "Why don't you come inside? I'll make you something... It's really tough being away from home..."</p>
<p>She was looking us over, but we were looking her over too. I figured this woman loved to talk, so she couldn't be all that bad. I nodded and invited Brother Tiger to walk into the shop. The woman rushed forward to lift the curtain. Who knew there was no room inside, just a kitchen with a lot of clutter. After the woman let us into the room, she dropped the curtain, and the room suddenly darkened. She then walked in front of us and said, "This room doesn't have any daylight, so it's hard to see. Be careful not to bump into anything." We followed her around the big dirt stove, and suddenly our eyes lit up. It turned out she had opened the side door. This made me wonder how the house was built.</p>
<p>After exiting the side door, there was a small courtyard, and behind it were several bungalows. The woman let us into the bungalows, treating us like honored guests, greeting us warmly, her mouth full of polite words: "The house is small, not good enough to invite guests. It's narrow and poor here, not like the front." As she spoke, she called to the next room, "Sister Cui, we have guests! Come over and greet them."</p>
<p>"Is this a black inn?" I thought of the "Little Five Righteous Ones" and "Seven Swords and Thirteen Heroes" stories I had read before.</p>
<p>After a while, Sister Cui came out, and I was shocked. Her face, demeanor, and dress were all like one of my classmates from Beijing.</p>
<p>"Eh!" I couldn't help but exclaim, "Did you study at ×× Middle School in Peiping?"</p>
<p>"Not ×× Middle School," Sister Cui smiled slightly, two red clouds rising on her face, "It's Chengxi Girls' Middle School, a missionary school."</p>
<p>"Oh!" I was reminiscing, "What's your name? Could it be..."</p>
<p>"My humble surname is Ji." She seemed a little dazed, as if she was also reminiscing, "I know... Mom..." She turned to the talkative mom and said, "Didn't our cousin study at ×× Middle School?"</p>
<p>"Look at this child," her mom said with a laugh, clapping her hands, "I haven't been to Beijing in years. Who remembers what middle school? You're talking about cousin, isn't that your third aunt's Xiaoyu?" She then said to me, "I'll go to the back for a while and come back later. Please talk." As she spoke, she walked into the back of the house.</p>
<p>"That's right," Sister Cui said to me again, "I have a cousin named Huang Yuhua, who is six or seven years older than me. She studied at ×× Middle School... She has the same face shape as me..." At this point, she glanced at Brother Tiger, and her face turned red again.</p>
<p>"That's right," I suddenly understood. Wasn't her cousin the classmate I was talking about? But I couldn't remember the three words Huang Yuhua. I only stayed there for more than half a year, and it's been three or four years since then, so of course I wouldn't remember. "Is she still studying?" I wanted to ask about her whereabouts.</p>
<p>"She hasn't been studying for a long time... Oh!" A look of misery and pity suddenly appeared on her face. "She's like us—poor now." She lowered her head and picked up a corner of her clothes.</p>

<p>— Shaofu</p>
<p>"You are not a fish, how do you know the joy of a fish?"</p>
<p>"You are not me, how do you know I don't know the joy of a fish?"</p>
<p>I am certainly not you, and you are not me... thus arguing without conclusion. Today, the top animal in Shanghai is the panda. Everyone is keen to talk about it, but no matter what, even if we understand it to the fullest, we are still humans. Whether its death is tragic or not, it is all judged by human emotions or reason.</p>
<p>One fact is certain: its death was due to changes in its living environment. We already know that those in charge spared no expense for it, even airlifting wheat bran from Sichuan to make its feed.</p>
<p>It is certainly not an ordinary dog. People know too much about dogs (to the point where it is difficult to distinguish between humans and dogs), so people can play with dogs, or dogs can play with people, and both can live in peace and harmony. But it is a panda, a rare animal, difficult to serve, which is only natural.</p>
<p>No one knows how many pandas there are in Wenchuan, Sichuan, but everyone knows that there are so few that they are almost non-existent. So when one dies, there is naturally one less. It seems that this kind of animal does not appreciate favors. People are trying their best, even risking their lives, to go abroad for a "镀金", see the world, and then come back to praise from Truman's pants to the eyelashes of Hollywood actresses. But it either dies prematurely or is not blessed to live in peace (Miss United), is it not a lack of blessing?</p>

<p>— Binzhi</p>
<p>Although I am not a fool, I want to talk about dreams.</p>
<p>What is a dream? Most people are superstitious about dreams being omens. In ancient China, there was the saying "Bearing a bear or a羆, a sign of a son; bearing a viper or a snake, a sign of a daughter." But it always feels like far-fetched reasoning. Psychologist Freud wrote a book called "The Interpretation of Dreams," but his theory is also very strange, and many people always have doubts about his claims.</p>
<p>"You think by day, you dream by night" is indeed the cause of dreams. The flow of thoughts in the brain and the activity of nerve cells often cause dreams. For example, a student dreams of taking the exam in the examination hall a few days before the exam. Stimulation from the outside world during sleep can also cause dreams. Hearing the sound of an alarm clock can dream of hearing thunder, and touching something wet on the hand can dream of encountering rain. In psychology, the former is called "thought dream" and the latter is called "sense dream." Although sense dreams are caused by external stimuli, they are not unrelated to past experience, only less so than thought dreams.</p>
<p>The phenomena that occur in dreams are related to your past experiences to some extent. Sometimes the dreamscape feels very novel. This is not unrelated to your past experiences, only that the memory is insufficient. Or even if you have not personally experienced it, you at least have an imagination in your mind, and this imagination is also a kind of mental activity.</p>
<p>Random Thoughts</p>
<p>When you are awake during the day, you will not speak incoherently, nor will you act rashly, because of the constraints of the social environment, you will control yourself. Although you will sometimes have random thoughts, you will not reveal them to the outside world. This orderly rational behavior is called consciousness in psychology. When you sleep, everything in your body rests, but the activity of your brain nerves does not stop. Many thoughts and actions that are restricted during the day will then surge up layer by layer in your mind, because the activity of consciousness is stopped at this time, and nerve cells can move without restraint. Dreams are produced in this situation. Therefore, dreams can fully express each person's personality.</p>
<p>Why can dreams become omens? Someone dreams of being sick, and soon becomes sick. This is related to physiological changes in the body, because the occurrence of a disease often has a sign that is latent in the body beforehand. During the busy daytime, there is no time to carefully observe this latent symptom, but it will manifest itself during sleep. Many behaviors are also like this. There is a tendency for activity in the mind, but you have not felt it yourself, but it is activated during sleep.</p>
<p>Huangliang Dream Awakens</p>
<p>There is a legend called "Pillow in the Records," which tells the story of Lu Sheng meeting Lü Dongbin in an inn and borrowing Lü Xian's pillow to sleep. In his dream, he lived a life of half a lifetime of wealth and glory. When he woke up, Lü Xian's yellow millet rice was not yet cooked. The story says that the life of dozens of years in the dream did not even take the time to cook a meal. Is this not too unreasonable? No, the time in dreams is indeed very short. According to psychological research, a simple dream does not last more than a minute, and a complex dream only lasts two or three minutes. A five-minute dream is already very long. The time of dreaming is a few minutes before waking up from sleep.</p>
<p>When you wake up, can you completely remember the scenes in the dream? There is no such person in the world. Because the brain stops activity during sleep, it is not easy to firmly preserve the things encountered in the dream. In the early stages of waking up, you can remember a little, but it is only a very small part. Soon, what you remember will be quickly forgotten. Unless you are able to remember more clearly when you are in a hazy half-sleep state, but you will never remember everything.</p>

<p>— Dinghao</p>
<p>A foreign gentleman lived in 毘明 and learned a few phrases of Pidgin Chinese, which he often showed off.</p>
<p>Once, one of his Chinese friends, who was a captain in the army, returned from the front line. The foreign gentleman held a banquet to welcome him.</p>
<p>When the wine was half-drunk, the foreign gentleman stood up and gave a speech in Chinese, saying: "Today, I am very happy, because my mistress, whom I haven't seen for a long time, has returned..." The guests burst into laughter, and the captain friend blushed. After inquiring, they learned that the foreign gentleman had translated Captain into "兵頭" (soldier head), and pronounced "兵頭" as "姘頭" (mistress), which made the captain friend feel embarrassed beyond words.</p>
<p>The foreign gentleman knew that drinking the wine dry was called "乾杯" (gan bei), and drinking at will was called "隨便" (suibian). So he picked up his wine glass and stood up, about to open his mouth, but he forgot the word "隨便", only remembering the character "便". After thinking hard for a moment, he suddenly remembered and loudly said to everyone: "Gentlemen, let us all excrete, excrete"!</p>
<p>After the wine was drunk and the meal was eaten, the foreign gentleman instructed the servant: "Bring me the pants I bought today." The servant brought a new pair of pants, and the foreign gentleman hurriedly waved his hand and said: "No, no! It's pants, to be put in a basin, it's pants"! After much insistence, they realized that the foreign gentleman wanted the fruit that was eaten after the meal!</p>

<p>— Suobei</p>
<p>On this, the eighteenth day of October, the thirty-fifth year of the Republic of China, I respectfully offer three cups of American coffee to the soul of the late Miss Panda, saying:</p>
<p>Alas, poor Panda, just celebrating going abroad for "advanced studies," suddenly ascended to heaven due to a minor illness. When the news came, humans and beasts mourned together!</p>
<p>Is it because you would rather die for freedom than live without it? If it was because you were resentful and sick, and died to thank American goodwill, then from a human perspective, our Panda is a bit stubborn! Wealth and honor are like fleeting clouds, why sacrifice yourself for principle?</p>
<p>Alas, Panda, so sad, so painful. If you have a spirit in the afterlife, quickly borrow a corpse and return to life. Even if you don't answer the goodwill of the foreigners, you should think about the three unfilial acts! Soul, return quickly! Alas, the sound of mourning still echoes.</p>
<h3 id="e200">Rickshaw Puller Appointed Senator <a href="#e200" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c200" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">200</a></h3>
<p>— Dunfu</p>
<p>The Senate is the only institution that represents public opinion, and senators represent the people of all walks of life. Just among the senators in this city: there are teachers, reporters, lawyers, accountants, doctors, and even female workers... It can be said to be "all-encompassing and all-inclusive." Recently, a friend came from Hangzhou and brought even more exciting news: one of the senators in Hangzhou is actually a "currently employed" rickshaw puller!</p>
<p>The name of the senator is Zhao Tingxiu, a native of Shaoxing, who makes a living by pulling a rickshaw. When he is wearing ragged clothes, pulling a rickshaw to solicit business on the street, who would have thought that he is actually a distinguished senator?</p>
<p>And this Mr. Zhao puts down the rickshaw handle and still wobbles to visit the governor and mayor, attends meetings, and is busy all the time. He is still wearing this set of dirty and old clothes, so he is always scolded by the gatekeepers when he visits dignitaries: "Get out!" When he slowly took out his business card, the gatekeeper saw the glaring title of "Hangzhou City Senator" and couldn't help but be stunned for a long time before letting him in.</p>
<p>An American reporter in Hangzhou discovered this matter and was overjoyed, hurrying to send a telegram back to his country to publicize it widely. The newspapers in Hangzhou also competed to publish photos of the senator.</p>
<p>My friend's words ended here. I deeply feel that this is not just a topic for after-dinner conversation, but indeed a good sign that China is implementing democracy. Because:</p>
<p>Senators are originally representatives of the people of all walks of life, and the working masses naturally also enjoy the same civil rights!</p>
<p>Auspicious Sign of Democracy</p>

<p>The man standing is a thirty-nine-year-old groom, Charles Bees. The old woman sitting on his left is a seventy-seven-year-old bride. She already has four children and twelve grandchildren (or granddaughters), but the old woman in her twilight years has remarried. It's really wonderful and interesting! According to herself, she met her husband two months ago. This is a "whirlwind" marriage.</p>

<p>Editor's Note: This journal published an article on August 22 entitled "Do you have the following desires?", which stated the highest goals in life: (1) Obtaining a huge amount of money; (2) Achieving fame in society and being respected by the masses; (3) Striving for the highest achievement in a certain career and becoming famous; (4) Hoping to live a simple, pure, pleasant and stable life, neither seeking fame nor fortune; (5) Serving society and enhancing the welfare of compatriots; (6) Don't know</p>
<p>Readers are deeply interested in this, and have expressed their thoughts on the above goals, mostly hoping to live a stable and simple life, while others say that the goal of life is simply unknown. Now, we will extract a part of the outlook on life of these people in turmoil:</p>
<h3 id="e203">The Eternity of the Universe <a href="#e203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>— Du Qiuyuan</p>
<p>I think the highest goal in life is to live a simple, pleasant and stable life. Neither seeking fame nor fortune, quietly enjoying the reality of life, while appreciating the eternity of the universe.</p>
<p>From a biological point of view, humans are just one of the animals, like birds, beasts, insects and fish; they are just a kind of organism living on the earth's crust! They are neither born for fame and fortune, nor born for money, nor are they labeled as born for "work." To be honest, they are just seeking survival!</p>
<p>Exaggerated people forget the greatness of nature and the eternity of the universe; at the same time, they also forget their own insignificance.</p>
<h3 id="e204">A Peaceful Country Life <a href="#e204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>— Shi Pei</p>
<p>Under the current circumstances, I am unwilling to step onto the political stage, because maybe I will be blinded by the temptation of money and become a corrupt official who is scolded and hated by the public. I am also unwilling to be in the forest of giant merchants, fearing that I may use clever means to take advantage of my superior position, secretly and unknowingly earn a large sum of money that violates my conscience, and then publicly donate a thousandth or a hundredth of it to exchange for a philanthropist's mask! I really hope to be a middle school or elementary school teacher in a small city or village, spending all day with those innocent and lovely children who have not yet experienced the world. I want to do my best to teach them, so that each of them will become good and useful citizens! I want to live in two neat rooms, taking a walk or fishing in the fields when I have free time, taking some money to maintain my life, reading my favorite books, writing what I want to say in my heart, not seeking fame or fortune, just living a simple, pure, happy and stable life peacefully!</p>
<h3 id="e205">Simply Don't Know <a href="#e205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>— Jinghua</p>
<p>Which item is my highest goal in life? One, obtaining a huge amount of money:</p>
<p>I don't want to commit crimes for money, nor do I want others to commit crimes for my money, so I don't hope to obtain a huge amount of money!</p>
<p>Two, achieving fame in society and being respected by the masses:</p>
<p>I want to be a free person, so I don't hope to become famous in society either.</p>
<p>Three, striving for the highest achievement in a certain career and becoming famous:</p>
<p>A person who can achieve the highest achievement in a career and become famous is immortal, commendable, and enviable. However, for someone like me, who was not given any special talent at birth, and is in an environment where I "can't get enough to eat and can't starve to death," and wants to strive for the highest achievement in a career, this really makes me wonder where to start?</p>
<p>Four, hoping to live a simple, pure, pleasant and stable life, neither seeking fame nor fortune:</p>
<p>Regarding this item, a pleasant and stable life is what I need. Although fame and fortune are not what I seek, I am unwilling to give my entire life to simplicity and purity. I also believe that even if there is a series of simplicity and purity in my life, it will never produce happiness, so my goal is not this item either.</p>
<p>Five, serving society and enhancing the welfare of compatriots; when my conscience is discovered, I often think this way, and occasionally I will "become angry with righteousness" and do a few similar things. However, this conscience is momentary and will disappear in an instant, so I can only regard it as an episode in my life, not as my goal.</p>
<p>Six, don't know: Indeed, my answer can only be don't know. Times are changing, the environment is changing, who can grasp the future? It is so embarrassing to have hope and then turn into disappointment at that time. Then, it is better to just do it and see!</p>
<h3 id="e206">The Only Ambition <a href="#e206" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c206" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">206</a></h3>
<p>— Gao Shuizhi</p>
<p>I am unwilling to belong to any faction, nor am I willing to belong to any party; I stand firmly on the position of "person" and seek peace and well-being for mankind!</p>
<p>I do not believe in any religion, nor do I worship any idols; based on the truth that "people should love people," I will devote this short life to it!</p>
<p>I have no ambition for power or desire for fame and fortune; "All people should obtain the peace and joy of life"</p>
<p>That is my only ambition—desire—belief!</p>
<h3 id="e207">Four Objectives <a href="#e207" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c207" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">207</a></h3>
<p>— Because</p>
<p>What I hope for are four things: health, knowledge, art (music), and love. Other than that, I don't seek anything.</p>
