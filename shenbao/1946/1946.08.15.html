<h3>廬山將由重要集會　曾琦謁主席陳國是意見　馬歇爾最近並無返美意</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十四日電〕據悉：蔣主席爲廣泛徵詢國內各方對國是之意見，將分批邀請各地德高望重之士，各大學校長，及各省民意機關領袖如省　會議長等，前往牯嶺晤談。並聞此項會談，不　會議形式，亦不定談話之主體，傳於各人均得就政治，經濟，文化，教育，社會等當前最切要之問題，提供寶貴意見。此一談話將偽國大召開以前之最大而最重要之集議。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十四日電〕朱家駒定明日飛潯轉牯嶺，對行將在牯邀集各大學校長商談事，有所部署。</p>
<p>〔本報牯嶺十四日電〕青年黨領袖會琦於今日下午五時許晉謁蔣主席，會提出該黨對党　國是之意見。</p>
<p>〔本報牯嶺十四日電〕今日下午五時四十五分，蔣主席接見曾琦，曾氏對主席提前實行黨政及推行政協決議之決心，表示敬佩，並謂，九年前廬山爲抗戰決策地，希望今日之廬山爲和平之發祥地。談約一小時辭出。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十四日電〕蔣主席爲當前國是發表之告同胞書，津市於各報刊佈後，首都中外人士均極重視，威認在此混沌之時會中，蔣主席對全國政治經濟現狀之分析，及今後對時局處理方針之指示，實足以安定全國人民苦悶之情緒，尤其對於所提示之三點，明是非，張正義，明禮義，知廉恥，明責任，守法祀，認爲係我國民今後努力　國時之最基本之指針，實爲抗戰勝利一年來最重要之文告，各方反應均呈擁護之忱。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十四日電〕蔣主席之文告發表後，中共代表團周恩來曾作竟日之研究。頃據中共代表團發言人稱；共產黨方面認爲此項文告之嚴重性，爲十年來所未有者。共黨決仍本「無條件停戰」之原則繼續奮鬥，並盼全國賢達各黨派人士共同一致努力，更希望美國政府公平調處，美國鷹改變過去之舉措，如軍事援華案，運輸部隊等，庶使談判順利開展。一般意見認爲共產黨此項論調，實爲挑戰值強有力之明證，殊堪惋惜。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十四日電〕馬帥今日無活動，於　，蔣主席之文告後，沉靜緘默，未表示任何意見。俞大維於今日下午六時往訪馬帥，內容未悉。又馬帥日內即將赴牯四上廬山。</p>
<p>〔中央社華盛頓十三日電〕美副國務卿艾克遜，今日告記者稱：馬歇爾元帥最近尚無返美之意。記者詢以對馬歇爾及司徒雷登兩氏之聯合聲明有無評論。艾氏答稱：「聲明已甚完善，彼不再作何評論。」</p>
<p>曾琦談話</p>
<p>〔本報十四日牯嶺電〕曾琦今日發表談話如次：予於抗戰期中，先後發表「抗日必勝論」及「長期抗戰之心理建論」等文，當時頗有目爲高調者，其後幸賴最高統帥之主持，全國軍民之犧牲卒得事實上之證明，予實不勝欣慰。本日　蔣主席告全國同胞書，不禁引起九年前之同憶，當時被邀出席廬山談話會，會間蔣主席語及「戰事一起，萬不可中途妥協，中途妥協必召滅亡！」言時聲色俱厲。其後經八年之血戰，壓無數之風波，而蔣主席堅持所信，卒獲勝利，予與蔣主席政見雖不盡同，但對其意志之堅強，實不勝敬佩之至。猶憶蔣主席五旬大慶時，予會有聯賀之云：「還我河山敢因屬洛懷私見，期君　　，直邁會胡立大勳。」又西安事變後，予復有電慰蔣先生云：「所冀廣開門戶，延四海之英豪，永保與圖，摒九夷之窺伺，庶幾無忘在莒，桓公之　業以威，矢志沼吳，勾踐之熊　可遂。」今已大半見諸事實，予以快慰可知。至文告所云推行政協決議，實施和平建國綱領。予以政協代表立場，自表充分同情，唯改革全般政治，尚有若干具體問題，仍待繼續協商，此則有賴於朝野各黨及社會，賢達之精誠團結，蓋人類常以接觸而互相了解以　隔而易起誤會，民主立　之規模，若能於年內樹立，當可一新中外耳目，予於政治協商開幕與閉幕時，均以「開誠佈公，集思廣益，循名核實，激濁揚清」十六字貢獻於朝野各方，今欲實現蔣主席文告言，恐亦不能離此。又蔣主席強調政治糾紛宣用政治解決，尤與吾人夙昔主張「政爭宣決於　場，而勿決於疆場」之旨若合符節。昔孔子盛稱管仲之才，其理由則謂「管仲九合諸侯一匡天下不以兵車，如其仁」。蓋有武力而不輕用，乃爲政治家之上乘。蔣主席於二十五年定粵而不攻桂，予即知其已由軍事解決轉向政治解決，其後卒賴此以造成全國抗日統一戰綫，故政治解決久爲行之有效之方，予甚望今後一切問題，皆有政治解決，軍隊皆用於對外，國家必日　強盛。予意全國人士必皆具有同感也。</p>
<p>左舜生談</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕記者昨訪青年黨領袖左舜生氏，於本市華山路該黨總部，詢問該黨對主席所發文告之意見，承告，蔣主席表示，願遵照政協決議及整軍方案，解決目前一切問題，甚爲扼要。青年黨希望軍隊國家化與政治民主化能雙管齊下，於最短期間徹底實現。至青年黨主張召開廬山會議之用意，則係在目前馬司調停，及國公直接商談均感棘手之際，惟有訴諸廣泛人民之一法，在政協以後，國大以前，有此中間會議，如能運用得當，實爲有益，且與國公兩黨自來尊重人民之意，亦相符合。記者因中共主張以中國問題，加入英蘇，共同作中國問題之調解，但英美於蘇聯，對施姐其他問題，矛盾已多，如再加上一複雜之中國問題，非徒無益，治　益　，青年黨完全反對。左氏旋述及南京周濟道等發表所調「青年黨宣言」一事，謂青年黨過去確有周濟道其人，但以其在抗戰期間，達反黨祀，早經該黨開除在案，其假名招搖，或另有目的，不值一笑。又青年黨表示，現有黨員國員共五十餘萬人。</p>
<h3>廬山暑期學術講習會　主席囑每年舉辦　昨在行轅茶會招待講師</h3>
<p>〔中央社牯嶺十四日電〕蔣主席十四日下午四時半，在行轅召集廬山暑期學術講習會講師舉行茶會，到程時　，陳鶴琴，周邦道，等廿餘人，由陳委員布雷，吳文官長　昌，蔣教育長經國作陪，席間，主席首調：「原擬每週出席講習會，對全體學員訓話一次，無如工作甚忙，無暇分身，故於終業前已離山，深爲遺憾」。主席旋垂詢講習會內部組織，教學方針，學員成績甚祥，由程時　講師一一答覆。主席對於講習會之組織，甚爲贊許，以爲能利用業餘時間，使各學員得以鍛煉身心，努力進修，實爲一舉兩得之事，盼能年年舉辦。主席又詢及中正大學之校址問題，以爲該校若能選移於廬山附近，以廬山景物氣候之宜人，歷史意義之偉大，將來必可作育許多人才，努力建國大業。至此，主席復一一詢問各講師業務情形，並勉以提倡學術，改革風氣爲己任，各講師問主席　　指示，至爲感動，至五時半始散。</p>
<p>〔又電〕陳立夫十四日下午四時半，出席廬山暑期講習學會，講演「中國教育之目的」。</p>

<p>〔本報潘陽十三日電〕哈爾濱來客談：哈市西開火車，現縮短一站，到三岔河北蔡家滿爲止，行經三岔河時，見共軍正以火車頭套拉鐵軌，鐵軌枕木隨之掀起，拆軌聲至慘厲。一軍官坐車上，監視數十人，時上時下，捶擊不能拉起之鐵軌，另有車廂數節，乘有保護拆軌之共軍，一般人多不忍卒睹此項令人心痛之破壞。此拆毀鐵路之　關車，正由三岔河沿西段路綫向第一松花江岸進行，聞共軍對東段路綫亦將予以破毀，如次則三岔河至江岸間之變軌　　，化為烏有矣。</p>
<h3>司徒正處理校務　對我國局勢似存觀望</h3>
<p>〔本報北平十四日電〕根據此間外記著之報告，司徒雷登對於當前局勢，並不如昨日對中國記著談話之樂觀。大使會對合眾社派克等外記著承認，馬·司聯合聲名前，對和平談判殆已至難以進行之地步，截止今日，此種惡劣情勢並未有何改變，司徒此番回平，雖係處理校務，但亦略帶觀望性質，如時局愚見惡化，司徒是否回京繼續擔任大使，殊難斷言，蓋此公爲一「大老好」與教育家，殊不堪混沌局勢之折磨也。此間外籍記著幾大部相　軍調部關門在即，並認為饒伯森之赴京，不僅未報告安平事件，甚至可能提供參考材料，以待馬帥決定在此種情勢下軍調部之存廢問題</p>
<p>一個妙喻</p>
<p>〔本報北平十四日電〕記著今日訪某有資格人士氏，就其所見與體騐，對馬歇爾·司徒雷登過去之努力，由側面指出數點：（一）使馬帥·司徒之努力受阻者，固爲國共雙方之不能接近，但某一方面之要解決問題，而又以不解決問題爲一種方法的態度，頗使不慣於此道的二老，亦感覺無從下手，且每談一問題，對方　出以大迂迴之旁敲側擊手法，此亦美人所不習慣者，以賽球爲比喻，則二老人已非裁判，而成踢來踢去之球矣。聯合聲明雖非球　破裂音響，至少亦爲不耐之交待也。（二）安平事件，馬帥於清晨四十接護報告後，即往訪司徒，當表示「這事情很嚴重」，馬帥與司徒認為，事件背景不論其為有計劃的或僅屬局部行動，其爲一嚴重事實則無疑問。同時給予一般美人一大衝激，其後司徒會連接國內有人電報，表示倘此爲共產黨之有計劃行動，則爲共產黨一大錯誤，另有甚至表示「日本偷襲珍珠港之初，並不知其以後所得之結果」，此事件雖非如彼嚴重，而可爲股　云云。（三）前途如何，完全看當事者有否誠意與決心改變過去作風。</p>

<h3>以血汗確保滕麗</h3>
<p>在、一年前的今日，日本政府經過了三天的猶豫，終於接受了波茨坦宣言，並由日皇裕仁向全國軍民廣播，正式宣佈日本已向聯合國無條件投降；於是人類歷史乃展開了最光榮的一頁。聯合國艱苦作戰了八年，始能獲得最後勝利，故在去年今天，世界各國的人民，莫不在歡慶祝，中國的人民，更是樂極流淚。因此八月十五日的一個偉大勝利日，也就在人類歷史上永久記錄下來，給我們及我們的後代年年紀念了。</p>
<p>但是到了一年之後的今日，我們又遇、到了這個偉大的勝利紀念日，本應以最興奮的情緒及最愉快的心胸來迎接這個劃時代的一天；可是目擊四週客觀的環境，不論是國內的政局或是世界的大勢，都不容許我們過分樂觀。緬懷過去種種的艱苦，瞻望將來，眞是百感交集，無從說起，心頭只覺得有甜酸苦辣各種的滋味。</p>
<p>回想起一年前的今天，我國艱苦抗戰，毫無憑藉，僅靠了全國四萬萬人民的鮮血和熱汗，始能苦撐支持下去，歷八年之久，正到了精疲力盡的時候，敵人的侵略勢力，終於先我而崩潰了；這樣獲到的勝利，眞是不容易，可以說是世間最可珍貴的勝利，怎敎我國人民不樂極流淚呢？這種愉快，眞是人生「苦極甘至」所流露出來最崇高的情緒。同時在大戰剛剛結束之後，人民對於今後我中國，也莫不抱着美妙的理想，一致認爲戰的中國，必能步入和平·統一，民主·强大的新時代，可以成爲名副其實的四强或五强之一的國家。就是隔了一年，到了今天回想起來，也覺得是一種甜蜜的回憶。</p>
<p>當時人民满腔的熱情和美妙的理想，經過一年來事實的磨折，均已幻滅了，使大家感到失望的悲哀。在這一年之中，因爲有共產黨問題的存在，錯過了千載一時的黃金機會，怎敎我們不痛心疾首呢？以國內的情形而論，險象環生，不僅使困苦的人民，在戰後仍不能休養生息，而且又因爲生產停滯，物價飛漲無止境，使人民的生活，益感困苦，展望將來，如果共產黨問題仍不能獲致解決，則人民生活一時恐無改善的希望。因此我們在偉大的紀念日，想着全國四萬萬的人民均在水深火熱之中，怎能無動於中而不感到心酸呢？同時我國在國際上，因爲對於勝利有無上的貢獻，本可爲四强或五强之一；但是因爲國內多故，匪特未能獲得各國的尊敬與重視，抑且常常受到國際上的譏剌與誤解。去年十二月間英美蘇三國外長會議，竟聲明不干涉中國內政，使中國的國際地位一落千丈。堂堂四强或五强之一的內政，豈容外人置喙！何勞三國外長發表官言！所以莫斯科宣言，顯然是對中國的一種侮辱，至少也是一種譏剌。國人受此刺激，本可乘此，奮起自力更生，埋頭建國；但仍格於現實的環境，尤其是共產黨，它根本不要中國統一，最好能引起國際干涉，使中國淪爲西班牙第二。及至四國外長在巴黎開會，中國，竟遭到蘇聯外長莫洛托夫的侮辱，不願中國爲巴黎和會的邀請國，後經美國的據理調處，始能保留爲巴黎和會主席團之一，與英美法蘇四强輪流祖任主席。最近中共異想天開，一忽兒主張將中國問題請聯合國安全理事會處理。一忽兒又要求英蘇兩國在中國和平談判中處於與美國同等地位；研其用意，無非想降低中國在國際上的地位，降而爲三四等小國，其至要把中國變成連小國也不如的次殖民地。我們在紀念勝利日的時候，想到了這種自甘墮落的情形，又怎樣不覺得熱辣辣的呢？</p>
<p>我們在體味甜酸苦辣之餘，但有一種崇高的情緒，油然而生，這是因爲中華民族的至大至剛，使我們深信其必有光明遠大的前途。在抗戰期間，我國可謂毫無憑藉，所靠的，不過是我民族數千年的文化，國際正誼的力量，　和人類良知的權威而已。但是終究有去年今日的一天，獲得了最後勝利。同樣，在此建國期間國內雖有共產黨的阻撓，使「戰後復興或建設之艱鉅，更倍於戰時」，但是我們决不悲觀，更不必灰心，仍應運用我民族的良智及國際間的正義，排除一切在建國途中的障礙。我們在紀念勝利日的時候，全國人民均應下一個絕大的決心，要不惜任何代價，保持經千萬人流血汗而獲致的「勝利之，花」。並使其結成果實。這一朶勝利之花，是靠了千萬人的血汗栽培出來的，今後我們要流更多的血和汗，來灌漑這朵光榮的花，庶不致過去所流的血汗成爲白流。</p>

<h3>伊朗局勢突趨嚴重　蘇聯陳兵伊北部邊境　針對英軍開入巴斯拉</h3>
<p>（本報訊）倫敦十四日廣播：最近提出於聯合國安理會之伊蘇爭端，因英軍開入巴斯拉一事而死灰復燃。據伊朗駐美大使吿記者：「頃接報吿，自英軍開入巴斯拉後，蘇聯軍隊正向亞塞爾拜然邊界集中，局勢甚爲嚴重。」英國當局宣稱，必要時將派遣軍隊開入伊朗，以防再度發生騷亂，此事已引起伊朗之抗議及蘇聯之指責。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦十四日廣播：英國高級政府人員今日稱，英國將正式拒絕伊朗所稱英軍之開抵巴斯拉，對英伊關係勢必發生嚴重影響。英方拒絕伊朗抗議之照會，聞已送達德黑蘭英國大使館，待使館方面考慮之後，再向伊朗政府提出。非官方人士預測，英政府此項行動，可能促使伊朋總理沙丹納將此一案件向聯合國大會或安全理事會提出。</p>

<h3>蘇聯要求海峽控制權　英美均堅決反對　土耳其承認局勢嚴重</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦十四日廣播：據消息靈通方面預測，英國對於蘇聯所提「蘇土共同防衛」韃靻尼爾海峽之建議，將予以有力之反對。此間人士一致諷爲蘇聯此舉，顯欲獲得海峽控制權。按蘇聯曾通知土耳其，主張修改蒙德婁公約，英美兩國對於修改該公約一點，在波茨坦會議中曾獲協議，如實行修改，美國。將代表日本爲該公約簽字國。倫敦官方預料將召第國際會議討諭此事。或謂蘇聯有意與土耳其單獨會商，以解決此問題，或由黑海各國舉行會議以解決之。按土耳其對於韃靻尼爾海峽區域之主權，向受蘇聯之重大壓迫。</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓十四日電〕就今日現象觀之，美國諒將堅決反對蘇方改變韃靻尼爾海峽管轄權之計劃。美國必將堅持國務卿員爾納斯於去年十一月所定政策，禁止蘇聯在此海峽旁土耳其領土上，建立基地。</p>
<p>〔法國新社土耳其斯丹埠十四日電〕蘇聯向土耳其提出備忘錄，要求修訂蒙德婁公約，預料土國覆牒本日可交達蘇聯駐土耳其代辦。</p>
<p>〔路透社安加拉十三日電〕關於韃靻尼爾海峽問題，土耳其已拒絕蘇聯所提之原則，並申明由於蒙德　公約之訂立，此乃國際問題。</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敦十三日電〕此間觀察家預料戰爭結束以來最嚴重之外交衝突，將因蘇聯之致牒土耳其，要求修改蒙　婁公約而發生。蘇致土照會之第五原則，關於海峽之防務問題，蘇聯欲與土國共同防禦此一重要之水道，等於要求在土國取得軍事根據地，預料土政府必將竭力反抗之。蘇聯之照會，似未建議召開國際會議，但此一問題之足以影響巴黎和會，殆屬毫無疑義者。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社斯丹埠十三日電〕關於蘇聯對於韃靻尼爾海峽所提出之要求，土國政界人士一致認爲不可接受。土國各報一致認爲局勢嚴重，並堅持土國不能允許蘇聯參加海峽之防衛云。</p>

<h3>紐倫堡一幅書面　弋林態度自若算是硬漢　合眾社特派員著</h3>
<p>我上禮拜新從洲旅行歸來，碰到的人，十個有九個都好奇地問我紐倫堡軍事法庭審問納粹戰犯時的情形。「法庭裏是怎麽一種景象？」「戈林這個傢伙現在怎麽樣？」這裏我且寫下一點法庭上的花花絮絮。</p>
<p>戰犯們坐在被吿席中，一個挨着一個，擠得不得了，述轉身都辦不到，這使他們互相很敵視。有一天，那位制服畢挺，道貌岸然的普魯士將軍約德爾就站起身來大聲抗議，說不該叫他和這批卑鄙傢伙並坐在一堆。</p>
<p>只有戈林似乎最安然自若。這位從前滿胸勛章愛出風頭的人物，現在仍是還法庭上的紅人。也很知道自己會被判絞死，但他從不垂頭喪氣。不管怎麽樣，戈林總還算是一條好漢。</p>
<p>戈林坐在被吿席的第一個位子上。你從旁門一路進法庭的門，舉目一看，左邊就是被吿席，一共兩排，與　平行。他們的前面，是一張張的長桌子，坐着德國辯護律師。法庭的最遠一頭是紀錄員和法庭書記。在他們後面，台上，桌子高出衆人頭頂，是法官座。法官共有八位，美英法蘇各估二位。</p>
<p>檢察官坐在下面，桌子排得很寬。後面是很舒適的戲院式座位，旁聽者可以安然坐在那裏觀審，就好像是在動物園裏看野獸一樣，不過還更舒服些。被吿和法官席後面是翻譯員，證人席，和放映證據用的銀幕。</p>
<p>電影時常放出這些納粹戰犯從前所做出的，種種慘絕人實的暴行，例如比爾森集中營毒氣間，和達察屠殺塲等等·這批犯人有的就閉上眼睛，有的避開視綫，顧左右而言他。</p>
<p>審問很冗長無味，常是一整天，戈林普通只是坐着咧嘴笑笑。時時他也用筆草草寫個紙條交給前面的德國律師，但這種紙條已經無甚希奇，所以律師總是拿來就塞在口袋裏了。</p>
<p>戈林旁邊坐的是赫斯，面目　　消瘦。赫斯總是兩眼　着前面。里賓特洛甫，這位香　酒商變成的外交家，坐在前排旁邊，表情呆板，不過似乎是憂心忡忡的樣子。後排坐的則是杜尼茲。約德爾。殷堪脫這批人。審問的時候，他們都是凝神傾聽，四個翻譯員不停地把問答翻譯成英·法·俄·德文。法庭的每個座位前面都有個「譯意風」，裝置着四個鍵鈕，你只要轉動那一個鍵，就可以聽到你所能懂的這一種語文。</p>
<p>審問係在去年十一月二十日開始，現在已快要完了。六個星期以後，就要宣判，那時候，誰要處死，誰可逃生，也就都可分明了。（林西譯自合衆社特稿）</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕巴黎十四日廣播：今日和會聽取匈牙利代表對和約草案之意見。</p>
<p>〔聯合社巴黎十四日電〕保加利亞外交部長柯里希夫，今日在廿一國和會陳述意見，堅稱保國軍隊並未在任何前錢向反希特勒聯盟作戰。保國雖曾與德國勾結向英美宣戰，但保國軍隊僅作爲佔領軍，並無一兵一卒對南斯拉夫或希臘作戰，保國軍隊曾在塞爾維亞·匈牙利·奧塊利·及馬其頓對德作戰，陣亡士兵三萬二千名，此點曾爲史達林元帥在吿軍士書中承認。保國人民不解吾人何以在和平草約中被稱爲前敵國。義大利爲希特勒德國之第一盟國，反被正式稱爲共同參戰國。保國豈無權被考慮爲共同參戰國乎？</p>

<h3>蘇聯要求修改的　蒙德婁條約　本報編譯室特輯</h3>
<p>關於土耳其韃靻尼爾海峽問題，曾於第一次世界大戰以後一九二三年訂有洛桑條約，大致規定：（一）各國商船有通過海峽之自由；（三）各國祗得駛入一萬噸以下軍艦三艘於黑海；（三）海峽兩岸附近一定地域內不得設置要塞及配備軍隊。這對於土耳其顯然是一種不平等條約。因此土耳其在一九三六年四月十二日向洛桑條約簽字國致送照曾，要求各國修正該約中關於韃靻尼爾海峽撤廢軍備和自由通航條款，大致說土耳其　於歐洲局勢變遷，準備和各國進行談判，以便在「保陣土國領土不可侵犯性暨發展黑海與地中海間航務之必要條件下，立即成立協定，以冀制定韃靻尼爾海峽之新制度。」土耳其發出此項照會後，各國政府均立即答復，表示願考慮土耳其政府的要求，遂於同年六月二十二日在瑞士蒙德婁城舉行會議，到有英，法，日，俄，南斯拉夫，羅馬尼亞，希臘，保加利亞，土耳其等國代表。當由土國外長魯舒第提出新公約草案，經各國代表加以討諭後，經過種種修正，於一九三六年七月二十日由各國代表簽定公約。茲將其要點摘錄於後：（一）各簽字國同意以此約代替一九二三年七月二十四日之洛桑條約。（按洛桑條約之廢止，即含有准許土國在海峽設防之意。（二）各國商船皆可日夜通航不受限制，惟若土耳其爲交戰國之一員，則須按照指定路綫，於日間航行。（三）屬於黑海國家之一而不逾一萬五千噸之戰艦可以通航，超過一萬五千噸者，每次僅可有一艦通過。潛水艇絕對禁止通航。（四）規定在海峽航行之戰艦，絕對禁止使用飛機。（五）土耳其本身為交戰國之一員時。戰　通過問題，完全由土政府決定。土國於感覺戰爭威脅時亦可援用此項規定。（六）飛機在海峽上空通過，只准自東至西及自西至東之飛行，禁止自南至北及自北至南之飛行。（七）規定將海峽委員會之職權移交土政府。（八）公約有效時間爲三十年，滿期前兩年可通吿　止。</p>

<h3>滬破獲國際國際性走私　被捕要犯美人向在行總服務　靠玻璃襪發財　日入美金萬元　父子弟兄一黨</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕美軍罪行調査處，最近破獲一　及歡亞美三洲之數萬萬美元走私瀾稅組織，要犯之一上海部份首領勞勃華納，已由此間美海軍當局於昨日下午二時三十分，會同黃浦分局，於惠中飯店一〇九號房間內加以逮捕。此人以前係美海軍大尉，辭職後，於本年七月二日受雇於行總儲運署。其走私行爲，係自紐約運來玻璃絲襪（已不下二千餘雙），自滬運走生絲至美國及巴黎等地。據估訂彼由此項非法行爲獲利，每日在美金一萬元以上。此驚人組織之重要份子，均爲勞勃之家人，包括其父大衛，係紐約地曁商其昆仲阿爾弗，路易斯，奧斯卡等，均在海軍中服務，利用彼等職位上之便利，走私漏稅，已非一日。阿爾弗在柏林曾致電家中稱；「罪行調査處已發覺」等語。奧斯卡則在巴黎偸運香水出口。此兩人現亦均已被捕，惟路易斯尙未就逮。其父大衛則　稱不知底蘊，惟在其致勞勃之函中，會屢次詢問玻璃絲機之出售情形。現美軍當局尙在繼續偵査，以求水落石出。至勞勃木人是否將在滬受響，或送回美國，尙未有定云。</p>
<h3>海關於一個半月內　緝獲私貨四萬萬元</h3>
<p>走私洋貨，日趨猖獗，低價在市傾銷，正當工商業均受影響。海關最近緝獲之私貨，爲數綦鉅，自七月一日起至昨日止，一個半月內，經各方密報而緝獲之走私貨物，共達四萬萬元之鉅。此項貨物，以玻璃褲帶，絲襪，香烟，罐頭食物及雜品爲最多。</p>
<h3>國貨工業一條出路　普遍推銷到農村去　研商與全車合作機構密切聯繋　國貨廠商應邀舉行茶話會</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕中國國貨聯合營業公司總經理王志莘，及社會部全國合作社物品供銷處上海分處兼經理陳仲明兩氏，爲謀全國各級合作機構密切聯繫，使國貨普遍銷於廣大農村計，於昨日下午四時特聯名邀請本市各國貨廠商及金融界人士，舉行茶話會。出席各界代表五六十人，吳市長亦於四時卅分趕到參加。首由王志莘氏起立致飼，略稱：今日願以國貨聯營公司，與本市國貨界友誼之地位，介紹全國合作社物品供銷處。該處在內地，已有多年歷史。在本市則尙係初次與各位見面。該處爲全國合作社之供銷機構，今擬利用該項機構，使國貨銷售於廣大之農村。今日論國貨事業問題者，莫不感苦悶。惟本人深信，國貨事業仍將有其前途。目前雖因外貨源源傾銷，國內情形對生產情形，又頗多障碍。然本人深信，民族要生存一日，國貨亦必然有其生機。目前最主要之課題，　為如何使生產及消費發生聯繋，相互合作。此事在國貨聯營公司，及全供處兩機構上，均應負起責任。目前國貨事業之困難，相信僅係一時間問題，不久即可望解決。抗戰期間，各國貨工廠，對國家無不相當貢獻。際茲建國時期，更應研究樹立生產與消費立體之聯繋機構。關於該一制度之意見，已另詳「建立國貨產銷連銷制度意見書」中，茲不贅述。現請吳市長賜示指導。</p>
<p>吳市長當於掌聲中致詞，略稱：對適才主席表示，國貨前途光明之信心，本人亦有同感。然要國强，須增强加國富，發達國內工業，及擴展國貨事業。現國內情狀，雖尙有種種困難問題等待解決，惟以我國先天條件優越，地大物博，故本人對政治問題前途，素抱樂觀，對國家前途，終覺光明在望。故國貨事業之前途，亦必光明無疑。</p>
<p>工人紀律已見改善</p>
<p>吳市長旋論工資，略謂：一切工潮，均須有合理之解決。例如工人對待遇之要求，須顧到廠方之負祖，決不能殺鷄以求蛋。又我國向以工資低廉著稱，今乃較美國猶高，對我國之工業，自感不甚協調。次論工人紀律，吳市長謂戰後各國工人紀律，普遍不佳，惟近兩月來，本市工人紀律問題，顯已改善良多。現工人方面，對當前工業處境，亦頗瞭解。今後此項瞭解，可望日趨深切。國貨工廠方面，如有需要地方政府從中帮助調解等等事務，本人願盡力辦到。不能辦到，是本人能力不逮，或力不從心，惟願帮助諸位解決一應困難之誠懇，保證永不泯滅。</p>
<p>對全供處之辦法，吳市長頗以爲然。惟認目前情形，以國貨與外貨在大都市競銷，事實上恐有困難。故主張國貨應設法向各農村發展。並望各國貨工廠，應利用最新式之科學管理方法，及機器。吳市長稱：最近有自台灣考察歸來之人士談：深感日人經營台灣之最成功處，在一「省」字。故望各國貨廠商，在機器與技術之外，處處應硏究如何節省。面對現實，先事鞏固國貨在農村之基礎，然後設法使國貨與外貨在都市競一日之短長。吳市長最後又重申其協助國貨工業，解除困難之決心。</p>
<p>國貨工業自救之道　　旋由陳仲明起立致詞，路稱：因鑒於目前國貨工業危機之日迫，乃與王志華先生編及，國貨工業界，誚有自救運動。自救之道，即生產與消費兩界，應組織起來，兩者直接聯繫合作。相信國貨事業，必有前途。目前國貨在大都市雖不能與外貨競爭，惟可向各農村鄕鎭推銷出路。現全供處在全國已有十四處分支機構。各地合作社，多至十七萬單位。社員多至一千八百餘萬人。如能利用此項機構，作爲推銷分配網，必能發生極大之力量。惟甚望國貨廠商及金融界，予以一臂之助。待具有力量後，當再盡力改善，以期與外貨競爭云。</p>

<h3>國貨產銷銷制意見書內容要點</h3>
<p>旋由鴻興織造廠新光內衣公司大中工業社等各廠商分別致詞。座談會至六時卅分始吿散席。茲探錄該「建立國貨產銷連鎖制度意見書」內容大要如次：該意見書首叙國貨廠商當前之危機。繼論危機癥結所在，認爲：一係財政經濟政策之落後，二係外貨傾銷之壓迫，三係工潮起伏之威脅，四係成本價之高漲。末論挽救危機之對策，認爲有四項實踐之原則：（一）深入農村，（二）佈置全國消費網，（三）切取生產者與消費者之聯繫、（四）先決條件方面，更認爲：（甲）目前動蕩不定的政局，必須立刻轉化爲和平建設之新局面。（乙）財政經濟政策，必須適應國民經濟建設，尤其工業建設之要求。（丙）國營企業，必須扶植民營企業之發展。（丁）交通必須迅速復員，而予國貨廠商以運輸上之各種便利。（戊）政府必須培植大量技術人才，輔導民營企業，改進生產技術，並協助民營企業向外採購生產工具及原料等。</p>

<h3>飛機模型比賽給獎　鐵鳥臨空表演　低飛掠過人頭　復興公園盛況空前</h3>

<p>旋由該會總幹事石邦藩致詞，石氏有「獨臂將軍」之稱，此臂乃於抗戰初期時所喪失，渠說明航空模型比賽所以要假在虹虹橋飛機塲舉行，是有歷史意義的，因爲抗戰開始時，第一顆子彈就自虹橋飛機塲出去的，而該地更是空軍補給站，故富有回憶意味，宣鐵吾司令則謂現代的戰爭是立體式的，所以空軍的地位極形重要。演詞完畢，給獎開始，由吳市長授給各項優勝者獎品，計有：（一）彈射滑翔模型：第一名鄭裕碩，第二名黃世鏞，第三名馬尤章，最高紀錄四十二秒。（二）平擲滑翔模型：第一名黃世鏞，第二名周忠文，第三名胡庚生，最高紀錄二十七秒。（三）桿身牽引滑翔模型：第一名宋文良，第二名陳永福，第三名高發仁，最高紀錄二分三秒。（四）桿身橡筋動力模型。第一名張汝瑛，第二名馬龍章，第三名陳國祥，最高紀錄三又十分之六秒。（五）艙身牽引滑翔模型：第一名宋文良，最高紀錄四分。（六）艙身橡筋動力模型：第一名趙大伍，第二名張世權，第三名陳國祥。（七）桿身橡筋非正式最高紀錄邱國隆。（八）汽油動力模型能升空者鄭顯基等。給獎完畢，該會職員與優勝者攝影留念。時有P51型之驅逐機及B24型之轟炸機各三架，臨空表演助興，該機飛行極低。幾於一人頭上掠過、羣衆皆拍手高呼,盛況堪稱空前。惜天公不作美，忽爾烏雲密佈，大雨來襲，衆皆倉惶散去。</p>

<h3>主席關念工商危機　文官長促提供具體方法　市商會請政府迅速實施</h3>
<p>〔本報牯嶺十三日電〕記者今訪吳鼎昌，詢滬工商界請願事，承告主席對此事，頗為關念，並深切了解，表示代表等儘可向主管當局作切實討論，以謀解決，吳氏繼稱，政府當局對於挽救工商危機，早具辦法，但是否能配合工商界實際困難，則頗成問題，目前關鍵，並不難解決，祇須工商界向主管當局，提供具體方法，政府當可對症下藥，如建議中第二項原則，速辦生產貸款一點，相信政府必能同意，但工商界必須擬具辦法，如何方能使貸款確實用在生產事業上，而不作投機之用，又關於當前時局問題，據吳氏個人觀察，尙有一僵持時期，蘇北撤軍及地方政府，仍爲問題中心，共產黨認爲對其不合算，故堅持不願退讓，致終止衝突之方法，至今未能覓得。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕市商會昨日下午三時，召開理監事會議，聽取代表團報吿，並討論請政府迅定經濟政策，解救工商危機，應如何繼續辦理，經代表報吿後，決議（一）致電牯嶺蔣主席及宋院長，說明請願事項，請迅予實施，並請宋院長指定地點時日，俾代表得以晋見，（二）維護蔣主席十四日之文告，請貫徹主張，解除經濟危機，（三）忠吿共產黨，接受主席文吿，遵照政協決議·退出政府所指定之交通綫，以利運輸而復而復生產。</p>
<p>昨本報請願代表潘士浩氏談在京與財經兩部洽談經過，茲續誌如下。</p>
<p>工業貸款原則　須避免通貨膨脹　中小工業先救濟</p>
<p>代表團此次要求之工貸達二千億元。但經聲明：此中尙有分別輕重緩急先後辦理。並述工貸之目的有二：（一）增加生產品，使物資增加，通貨回籠。則非但無通貨膨脹之危險，且有抑平物價之可能。（二）以平利之工貸，歸還黑市之高利貸。則市塲通貨不致膨脹，而工業成本可减輕。經財兩部，對此原則，亦表同情。但以爲國家財政困難，增發鈔票，終應盡力避免。且經部以爲目前工業之困難，在資本，技術，勞働，管理等諸方面，均應努力。單恃工貸，不足生效。惟經部表示：對中小工業困難之特深，應急予救濟。又據表示：將另設機構辦理貸款及管理事宜</p>
<p>至關於四聯總處之存廢中央銀行及普通銀行之聯絡間題，據財部表示：此事歸宋院長主持，　應向宋院長請示。惟會加說明：四聯總處，為戰時機構。現情勢變動，其政策自應加以調整。且政府現對於工貸並未漠視。除鹽，麥，絲，茶四業，均已有鉅款貸出外，其他重要工業，當亦在考慮之中。將來所貸者，為鈔劵抑為實物，則尙待詳細討論。務使不引起通貨膨脹，物價高翔爲原則</p>
<p>稅法尚須改長　營業稅的分等級　牌照稅從寬辦理</p>
<p>代表團認爲現行所利得稅簡化稽征辦法，須征取卅四年度之所利得稅，頗感困難。對各地營業稅之稽征手續，代表團尤多指摘。財部直接稅署表示：所利得稅之稽征，當求其簡而能化，以了此積案。營業稅之稽征，如有苛擾情事，自應嚴加整飭。並據表示：現行營業稅法，定於戰時。現時勢變遷，自應加以修正。如批發，另售，製造稅率之應分等級，已在擬議之中。至印花稅原爲憑證稅。除非人民應規避貼花，而故意不列憑證外，其因善良習慣，而未有憑證者，當然毋須貼花。關於營業牌照稅，原爲取締稅。近來滬市府增加種類，且以估計資產之手段，强行增加稅額，代表團特提出請求救濟。據財部地方稅司表示：現行營業稅，已劃百分之七十，歸上海市府。則營業牌照稅，應依法從寬辦理。其品類及手續，如有逾越範圍之處，自應加以制止。</p>
<p>又代表團向經部表示：如工貸等積極之援助，一時尙難辦到，則免稅减稅等消極之救濟辦法，應請同情。據部方表示：生產事業之稅率，自應減低，並允與財部會商辦法。</p>
<p>王部長勸和節約　每月消耗二百億　宋院長見面緣慳</p>
<p>據悉：經濟部王部長，此番曾向各代表述其感想，略稱：現時上海每月之筵席捐及娛樂捐，收入可觀。根據此項收入，以推算此中所浪費之資材。每月當在二百億元左右。在此工商業困難之際，似不應有此現象。擬請諸位回滬勸導各業，力誓節約，從根本做起。各代表對此，均表同感。潘士浩氏且更以勤儉兩字爲此次請願之出發點。據潘氏吿記者：勤即增加生產，欲增加生產，必須維持工業，並防止洋貨進口之壓迫國內工業。儉必須减少消費，欲消費之减少，必須禁止奢侈品及非必需品之進口。</p>
<p>據稱：此次最感不湊巧者，即代表團到京之日，宋院長方於前一日飛滬。迨代表團抵滬之夕，曾挽某要員與宋院長接洽會晤時期，宋院長又以已定昨晨飛返南京，無法召見。</p>
<p>又聞市商會將於週內召開全體會員大會，以便報吿此行請願經過，及商討商會對政府態度應取之對策云。</p>
<h3>廣帮與大戶放空　華股多順流而下</h3>
<p>華股昨以廣帮傾出永紗，且有大戶傾向放空，情况頓吿悽凉，初時尙堪支持，平而多盤，晨初高價時永紗六九〇元，美亞三八八〇元，景福二二三元，新光二二〇元，勤興一六八元，開後遂逐漸微挫，大戶旁觀居多，缺乏維持，於是籌碼吿濫，近午突吿一瀉而下，成交冷落可憂，黑市股票大有夕陽無限好之慨，冷門各股並未遭受影響，結果較前收時永紗跌落半成弱，美亞景福新光勤興各跌半成有零，較冷各中小型股，中型平平，小型股則微有挫落，元老股尚乏出入。</p>
<p>外股略告穏定，英聯後來居上，較怡紗略高，怡紗遂自七六〇〇元升至七八〇〇元，餘者亦稍有帶上，結果較前收計美聯業廣鋼業微升，餘者均告平定。</p>
<h3>金鈔續跌</h3>
<p>烚赤昨繼續在多頭出籠下，掀動回風，港埠金市亦報小至三六二元，多方無意持久，自晨開時之高價一九八萬五後，陸續遭賣方壓迫，惟初時在一九七萬光景，盤旋殊久，十時後中央銀行配給四七條，價一九七萬，入後由平轉疲，近午斬售突盛，午刻退　一九四萬五以下，而後稍定，午後交稀價平，結果較前收續降二萬二，飾金掛低至念萬〇八，紋銀銀元平平，暗拆求供不一，暗息略有出入，大致自九分至一角四分不等。</p>
<p>外幣一致削落，美鈔晨開雖喊二五九〇元賣出，毫無需用，開後節節下游，迨後金市怯疲，午刻降至二五五〇元以下，午後亦難重振，結果較前收續跌二十元，港票突有某英商洋行大量供源，廣帮套賣電滙亦殷，自五七七元步降至五六五元以下，結果續跌九元，港滙退至五五六元，印滙六六八元，英匯八千九均有　售，美匯仍無變化。</p>
<h3>公債突起漲風</h3>
<p>公債連日平穩，昨買氣突盛，北帮及七樓某戶連袂吸收百餘萬元，閑散之抬面，經不起一二大戶急切收納，喊價易於抬高，戊丁業已追上統丙，有後來居上之可能，統丙自六三〇元步漲至八〇〇元，戊種自六四〇元升至七七〇元，丁種自六二〇元升至七四〇元，甲乙自四九〇元升至五四〇元，都以高價結束，結果較前收計甲乙升一二〇元，丙升一五〇元，丁升一四〇元，戊種亦漲一三〇元。</p>
<h3>黃山新毛峯　開至六十萬外</h3>
<p>紅綠茶內銷不斷，過程俏秀，平水新龍井再度前進，茲據同業消息，連日天津茶市，亦頗活絡，因多時未辦，存底已薄，是以在僧多粥少下，人心見挺，刻下黃山新毛峯每担已開至六十至六十五萬元間，至于本市洋莊交易，陳針眉，陳特貢等問津猶多，同時臺灣細紅茶，印度行家注視愈緊，價格方面，有似脫韁之駒，目前由裕隆洋行購進二百箱，每担創七萬五千元高價，餘則頗形穩定，又聞本月廿日，怡和，協新，午昌，在裕泰，新華等行將有相當紅綠茶裝運至歐美各國。</p>
<h3>商會議組　歐美考察團</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨日市商會理監事會議，曾討論發起組織歐美工商業察團，藉資觀摹，及高橋鎭准設分事務所等要案。</p>
<h3>黑白直貢呢之趨勢</h3>
<p>直貢呢有黑白二種，白色祗銷夏令一時，黑色全年行銷，故業中人俱呼爲萬家貨，昔年馬褂及瓜皮帽盛行時，元靑直貢呢極其旺銷，如榮泰一五三三〇，和豐二一一二七，德記一三三六，安利聚寳盆，公益金寳塔等牌，本客各帮莫不馳名一時，後因瓜帽馬褂相繼淘汰，實銷大减，同時國產本廠續有出品，近來完全祗靠鞋子一帮去路，行銷减削四分之三，由去歲勝利迄今，因受各地客帮之强烈採辦，趨勢已漸轉佳，行情賡絞向榮，邇日客帮需要蟬聯，市貨流通無多，價又趨堅，寅豐財神虎牌子，更見俏騰，白直貢呢早已落令，致雖久已著名之二二二，亦消聲匿跡矣。</p>
<h3>收買生絲問題　各方未能証實　華絲易越米煤在談判中</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕日昨報載：政府爲解決絲商困難，將收買生絲。並按生產成本估價，交由中央信託局收買之訊。記者頃以此事分詢各關係方面，尙未能予以證實。中央銀行及中央信託局主管方面，對此事表示未有所聞。且謂：如按生產成本三百八十萬元一担之價格收買，事實上恐非可能。旋據可靠方面消息：政府果按生產成本，將生絲收買，則（一）對鉅額之虧空，將如何彌補。（二）生絲以外，別種行業，亦將聲請收買。在該兩項困難未解決前，貿然由政府收買，似不可能。據聞：最近關係方面，方與法國進行以貨易貨之談判。目的在以我國之生絲，易取法屬越南之鴻基煤及米糧。聞該項易貨談判，刻已臻成熟階段。將來尙將會同各主管機關，支配易貨所得之物資。擬藉易貨所得之盈餘，作爲各絲商之貼補。據稱該項辦法，比較合理而符合事實，施行時當不致發生困難云</p>
<h3>紗銷疲滯　坯布續升</h3>
<p>昨日紗市價疲銷滯，客帮僅有零星添配，同行心思殊爲淡薄，執貨者均傾向吐售，是以各支紗線回降一萬之譜，趨勢又呈脆弱之象，中午紡建公司照例開紗，價與上期相仿，惟卅二支仙桃雙股筒紗，標低三萬元。</p>
<p>坯布堅穩如常，本街及染廠皆有零星需要，民營廠之細布，閩粵仍有採辦，所以市情續升五百元，惟嗶嘰尚平，陰丹士林布漸見生色，惟靑島來滬之細布，銷路不暢。</p>
<h3>三期平價糖</h3>
<p>昨日起普遍發賣</p>
<p>每人仍限購三斤</p>
<p>南貨商業同業公會奉令承辦之民需平價食糖，第三期已于昨（十四日）起開始普遍發賣，辦法照舊，每人至多限購三市斤，每斤售幣八百二十元，每日下午一時起售至三時爲止，此次出售奢，仍係台灣中砂。</p>
<p>又訊，昨糖市中砂白以現貨軋缺，兩日間步升一成許，已出十三萬元大關，聞第十期台糖有改配行方生砂赤之說，配額較多，市價可期轉鬆，公會有建帮開出刁靑一百十八包，八萬九千元，汕帮開出冲提靑九萬三千五百元至四千元，黃崗靑九萬二千元，計二百餘包，枝洋白八十包，十一萬八千元，惠州白三十包，十三萬五千元，上冰白四十包，十五萬元，興化帮開貢粉白二百數十簍，十三萬八九千元至七千元。</p>
<h3>煤市由軟趨堅</h3>
<p>煤市白煤塊因聞津地來客幫談，此間白煤塊存底亦薄，價格報漲，同業吸胃轉健，市况由軟趨堅，各貨俱見微升，白煤屑銷路極呆，交易寥落，烟煤塊供求適當，市况尙平，烟煤屑受煤油影饗，廠銷呆滯，並經濟部燃管會自即日起自動將開平二號屑，配價減低一萬元，開平一號屑減低五千元，開平塊煤未更動。白煤屑鴻基屑，聞於最近期內亦將減低配價。</p>
<h3>米價堅挺</h3>
<p>昨南北兩市到米四千餘石，新粳貨稀，回漲一二千元，白元亦高者見緊，中次仍呆，白粳均喊高，麵粉收盤彷彿，惟兵船粉略升百元，小麥北方仍選取白麥，中關黃豆到銷兩平，市而提高殺次甚烈，油市供求兩敵，午時廠方賣氣濃厚，各油均回小千元，豆餅消化不爽，步跌二三百元，麩皮小一二百元。</p>
<h3>人絲直綫下降</h3>
<p>昨市人造絲繼續下挫，市塲中求供失衡，人心虛軟，一二〇號天橋有光，首先做過一百六十五六萬元，直綫下降，最後做一百六十一萬元，雜牌一二〇號有光亦帶小六七萬元，半光及及一五〇號有光等，比上日小三四萬元，今日中紡公司及中央信託局等均有出貨，以致昨市乃趨下游，廠經因金價續疲，都存觀望，成交甚稀，喊價不短，綢貨漸趨繁榮，被面略有交易，好起一二萬元，其餘仍喊上日原盤。</p>
<h3>倫敦中國債券　市況呆定不變</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦十四日電〕倫敦股票交易所昨日交易仍吿滯呆，但市勢尙穩定，中國債劵仍呆定無變化。</p>
<h3>大批煤麥來滬</h3>
<p>〔本報訊）華綸洋行經理之菲倫雪斯曼利諾號，由美國格爾維斯頓（譯音）埠，運來麥七千四百餘噸，昨日進口，現泊四十一四十二號浮筒起卸，又怡和洋行代理之茀蘭柯爾門克爾號，自加拿大奈乃摩（譯音）港，運來煤斤八千餘噸，亦於昨午抵滬，現靠義泰興北棧起卸。</p>
<h3>上擋圓肉步昂</h3>
<p>上檔圓肉久未開出，近以桂元步昂，價亦隨緊，昨市開出廿餘件，比前漲起三四成之譜。</p>

<h3>錢塘工程考察記</h3>
<p>— 本報十三日嘉興訊　特派員儲裕生</p>
<p>錢江海塘關係着江南各縣的生命財產，這是衆所週知的事。海塘傾圮的險象，也經過了許多人的奔走呼籲，才由緊急搶修而渡入了修復改善的工程。本來緊急搶修時，曾成立錢江海塘緊急搶修委員會，暫救一時之急。</p>
<p>考察之發端</p>
<p>後來經過中央當局的注意，認爲整治錢江，實等於整治黃河一樣的重要，於是命令浙省府成立海塘工程局，並聘國內著名的工程師錢江大橋的建築者茅以昇爲局長。留美水利工程專家前運河整理委員會總工程師汪相楨爲副局長兼總工程師，浙省第十區專員機械工程師吳壽彭爲副局長，海港工程專家邵福旿，水利工程專家馮旦，及留美水利工程專家，現任行政院工程計劃團主任工程師唐振緒三君爲副總工程師，下設四處一室。由邵福旿兼設計處處長，馮旦兼工程處處長，金彭年爲材料處處長，沈寳璋爲秘書處主任。陳啓粹爲會計室主任，另聘侯家源，薛卓斌，張自立，黃家驊，鄭華，康時振，朱國沅，楊培琫，黃炎，杜德，耿德生，懷特好施，康益，狄海默，梅安諾，邵福旿，唐振緒等爲顧問工程師，侯爲行政院工程計劃團團長，鐵路專家，薛爲溶浦局總工程師，鄭爲前京滬鐵路局長。爲著名之橋樑工程師，康爲中央大學土木工程系主任公路專家，朱爲上海工務局結構處處長，楊爲交通大學敎授，黃爲溶浦局工程師，杜爲行政院工程計劃團美籍總工程師，懷爲英籍水利工程師，康爲丹麥籍橋樑工程師，狄爲工程計劃團美籍副緣工程師，張爲浙贛鐵路局局長，黃爲行聯浙閩分署總工程師，梅爲聯總美籍工程師，耿爲荷蘭洽港工程師，爲遠東海港工程權威。看這張赫赫的工程專家的名單，我們眞該爲江南人民祝福。</p>
<p>海塘工程局於八月一日在杭州成立，事前由浙省府沈主席邀約全體顧問工程師組織錢塘江海塘工程考察團到海塘考察，由唐振緒兼該團總幹事，他們在上海市政府大廈開會六天，一行於十日到杭州。十一日淸晨八時就出發，記者亦同時隨往。我這一次已是第四次來海塘了，第一二次都是單獨來的，第三次是團體來的，這一次隨着一個工程學術團體來，自然分外覺得有興趣。浙省府主席沈鴻烈，建設廳長皮作瓊，水利局長孫壽培，搶修工程處，總工程師馮旦，第十區專員吳壽彭都早已在海寗等候。車子滑過較前稍好，但未修竣的公路而到達海寗，老百姓們都站立在門前用懇切期盼的眼光來目迎目送。這都表示浙江省的上下對這許多位工程師寄予無限的殷望。</p>
<p>救一時之意</p>
<p>當日就去看陳文港的搶修工程，連去兩次，一直到深夜才回海寗，他們在新修的柴塘上來回推敲，硏究水性以及抵禦水流的方法。我很性急地問劉局長兼總工程師汪胡楨氏，他說：「目前緊要的是加强塘基，保護塘身。但要保護塘身，方法極多，如用木椿打入水底在塘基前成一遠大的弧形而成盤頭，也可以加以嘗試的」。胖大軀體的侯家源氏他也插口對我說：「目前還是先加强保護未坍的塘，修築已坍的塘，當爲必要的急務」。薛卓斌氏也說：「塘前塘後的泥値得硏究」。</p>
<p>當晚我們留宿在海寗，我急急地向茅以昇氏：「現在的搶修工程要得嗎」？他說：「這不過是暫救一時之急，今年秋潮原有的石塘是否再有危險不能担保，但駐有技工，可以隨坍隨修·工程局的使命，就是搶修坍壞的海塘和建築正式的錢塘工程」。我們大家談了好久，從錢武　王興修六和塔到後朝門的石塘談起，一直談到康熙乾隆的重視海塘，以及民國以來修理工程。甚至談到錢江海塘的外史，如錢鏐令人射海潮以築塘基和淸時陳閣佬的坐鎭海寗，乾隆的兩度來寗等。</p>

<p>海神廟之行</p>
<p>第二日侵晨，迎着朝　去海神廟，工程師們注意牆壁石上刻着的塘工地圖，後來我們又趕路了。聯總工程師梅安諾從杭州駕着吉普車趕來參加，更增加了一支生力軍，浩浩蕩蕩的向前進發。通過上回我和馮旦氏覆車受傷處，到達離海寗十公里第十堡的趙魏字號塘，這裏近百工人正在工作，是因爲八月初決了將近二十五公尺的口。唐振緒氏指給我看，在石塘下而的前面，有着一排木椿，木椿前後有一些石塊，這就叫做「坦水」，「坦水」是用來捍衛石塘的。沿途，孫壽培氏再三說明石塘後的土備塘重要，他　之爲海上的「馬奇諾防綫」。</p>
<p>黃炎氏吿訴我：「海塘塘基是要有泥來護衛的，坦水也是護衛的好方法，現在塘後塘前的泥土鬆了，有些坦水都壞了，自然要坍了」。他裝出矮矮的身材乘此站正作譬喩給我看，他說：「好像一個膝腿有病的人一樣。立直時如果有東西抵住，則自可站直，如果把東西抽去，自然要跌倒了」。</p>
<p>坍圮的石塘</p>
<p>再驅車前進，車在兩邊蘆草深深中疾駛，有幾輛車正迎面來，還得在窄狹的路傍等候，讓來車逼去了始能再走，沿途看見不少的鹽田。</p>
<p>重在尖山邊滑過，這尖山就是緊接着石塘的天然「塘」了。又經過了黃灣，衝過了澉浦，這裏人家很多，並築有城牆，從前很多海船來此交易，城牆是用以捍衛疆土的。</p>
<p>軍過長川壩，這裏的自衛隊曾經諱變過。到秦山脚下，相傳秦飴皇移山倒海，預備東海求仙，驅此山來引渡，故名秦山。秦山　以下，又是人工建造的石塘了。我們下車上石塘，見有些塘身尙健全，康時振氏吿訴我：「這裏的土質較海寗方面爲黏，海寗方面是土質細沙爲多，所以此處塘基較固」。由石塘向後望，見一座座烽火台，當年海盜倭寇來犯時，每以烽火吿警。因此，我們連想錢塘「堡」的名稱也就是堡壘的簡稱罷了。</p>
<p>到鄧衙橋，這裏塘身坍壞的很多，楊培琫氏吿訴我：「據吿石塘每丈下均有二百四十根木椿，石塘傾圮，大致均由於基椿之損，海寗方面的坍圮是由於水的侵蝕關係，海鹽方面的坍圮，是因爲塘身後缺乏護塘的泥。而椿的關係尤爲傾圮的主因」。黃炎康時振兩氏都說：「我們對於石塘工程相當佩服，你想這樣大的石頭一塊塊由人工搬運而來是多麼不易。乾隆時曾費一千五百萬兩銀子來修塘，更是難能可貴，不過後人因有依賴，忽略修理，致如此坍圯」。我們站在坍圮的石塘止，南前是一片江海，離塘不遠，有三座小山。孫壽培氏指給我們看遙遠的地方這一座山，名叫陳山，在陳山與秦山之間，就是東方大港。他曾和德國水利權威方修斯來考察過，後來他又親自在此工作過。他說：「最後水位低永時七米達，而最大船隻吃水須三十八尺六寸，雖可挖泥，但甚費力，好在現在上海租界收回了。」他又遙指更遠的山說明這是瓦山，前面的三堡小山爲不各名山，有名之為白塌山的。此山叛變的自衛隊曾飄流在這裏過。後來沒有淡水吃而上岸被解決了。</p>
<p>鄧衙橋缺口有十八處，但多塘身壞而塘基仍好，鹽平段搶修工程算是吿一段落了，動員技工五十餘人，工人二千餘人，　塘五條，土方共爲五萬四千八百多方</p>
<p>將到海鹽時，見一大段石塘均已坍毀，孫壽培氏說：「在一百多年前就坍了。」大槪錢江水流改道，和錢鏐時代六和塔至候朝門的怒濤，改在七堡至十一堡一樣的情形了。</p>
<p>重大的工程</p>
<p>到海鹽城，城內一所所大房子，現在僅存斷垣殘壁，它們矗立在荒蕪的蔓草叢中感着凄凉寂寞，不知何日得以復蘇啊！</p>
<p>常日下午，有一部份人上乍浦去，乍浦很好，沒有塘工上的嚴重危險。</p>
<p>記者把握一個機會，在一座樓上，先與邵福旿氏談治理海塘的問題。邵氏說：「這等於是治病，醫生在沒有完全明瞭病理前是不願輕下判斷，輕開藥方的。洽海治河都是治水，海鹽的石塘是治海，海寗的是治江，而今天的現象，海寗較海鹽爲難，治江較治海不易。最嚴重的是塘後的泥水與塘前的江流溝通了，就容易把石塘拖倒。」</p>
<p>茅以昇氏在他烱烱的目光裏，像看見了面前的海塘，他沉思有頃，然後說：「土木工程的對象是金木水火土。拿錢塘江大橋，來說你看「錢」旁爲金「塘」旁爲土，「江」旁爲水，「橋」旁爲木，最後我們破壞炸彈炸掉，不是火嗎？」我們哄然笑了。他接着說：我們看了錢江海塘，應有感想：第一，前人確費盡力量。這是在這樣重大的工程上可以看得見的。第二，費盡心思，錢江海塘是立體式的建築，石條一塊塊疊上去，在石條下又打椿，在石塘前又做担水，這都是要求塘工堅固。第三，似有科學根據，我們看海塘是彎曲波浪形的建築，藉以防急潮冲激，這是較爲合理的，合理即爲科學，前人旣費盡力量，費盡心思，無非求取一勞永逸，但是石塘偏要年年修，不能達到目的，這是什麽道理？因爲前人祗注意石塘的堅固，而忽略於石塘以外的力量。力量爲何？即水，土，風，錢江的土是有流沙性的，流沙性的土是容易被冲刷。第一，錢江水流時變，可將坦水附近的泥土冲去，影響塘基。第二，潮退後可將泥土帶去。第三，塘後雨水侵入加以江中冲刷影響，可將石塘本身整個滑陷。錢江冲刷作用實在很大，它可於二十四小時內將江底冲深二十五尺，即在一根木樁的四圍，也有冲刷現象。錢江海塘下的木椿或也爲蛀木虫所蝕，木椿頭如在低水位之上，有時入水，有時出水，也是易壞的。爲今之計，保坍重於修塘，治江重於保坍，治江須穩定河床，使流竄的江水歸槽，最好能使江河變爲狹而深，則江上可以通航，兩邊可以剩出土地開墾，並可在上游築塌連同潮水來發電，電力可以供應上海。所以整治錢江要利用錢江的特性，因勢利導，必能事半功倍。」</p>
<p>沖刷的作用</p>
<p>茅氏一再說明錢江冲刷作用大，水流急，有潮頭。他說：「錢江流量每秒鐘一萬五千立方公尺，流速每秒爲二。五公尺。現在治理錢江，須搜集資料，多做試騐，根據科學原理想出以柔克剛的巧妙方法。</p>
<p>「萬物都可利用，如能利用特性，則爲有益，未能利用，則成災害。」</p>
<p>他又讚揚中國古代的水利工程勝於世界任何一國，第一知道根據水的原理，第二，能利用本地材料，第三注意長期養護。他說四川灌縣的都江堰在完成的時期，外國的水利工程還不知在那裏呢？</p>
<p>我們在海寗留宿一宵，第三日平上乘輪船發嘉興，在嘉興南湖烟雨樓頭，記者對茅氏等說：「錢鏐興修錢塘，獲得萬世的崇敬，這次茅先生等把錢江治理好，茅先生等就是錢　第二，「茅氏拉着我的手說：「別太誇獎了。」</p>
<p>我因急於上杭州，臨別時，唐振緒氏吿訴我：「我們預定八九十三個月硏究和設計，十一月起就着手施工，想以一年爲期，先把坍毁的石塘儘量的補修完竣，大概六公里長，每公里需四十萬萬元。」</p>
<p>茅氏對記者說：「請你回去吿訴浙江的同胞，浙江人民的最大責任，是整理錢江！」</p>
<p>我在依依惜別無限期盼中，離開了他們。</p>

<h3>管制日本　本報資料室</h3>
<p>最近美國務院和英外交部專家已擬就對日和約草案，這是大家所注意的。今後如何改造日本以維持遠東和平，就要看這和約如何起草了。英美正忙着處理歐洲問題，對日和約，尚未公開發表，但從一年來遠東委員會和管制日本委員會所進行的工作中，可以看出各國對日和約的態度。</p>
<p>自一九四一年十二月八日日軍偸襲珍珠港以後，太平洋上的戰爭，除了中國始終其事外，祗有美國參加。英國堅持「歐洲第一」的主張，蘇聯對德作戰，已出動了大量的軍隊，所以對日只好維持中立，一直到一九四五年四月五日，才宣佈廢止蘇日中立協定。這時太平洋的形勢已經改觀了。八月八日，蘇聯正式向日本宣戰，但在三日之前，美國已在廣島投下了一顆原子炸彈，威脅日本不得不屈膝，因此在日本簽降之後，初步的佔領工作。亦由麥帥處理，這不免引起他國的誤會。</p>
<p>在倫敦五國外長會議中，蘇聯提出了共同管制日本問題。美國以爲不在柏林會議預定範圍之內，拒絕討論。至十月二十三日，曾參加。遠東顧問委員會開會凡三星期，成立一初步協定，並決定派遣代表，赴日本各地調查，以決定對日政策。代表團於一月中抵日，至二月中返國。</p>
<p>一九四五年十二月莫斯科三國外長會議中，再度討論共管日本問題。美國恐蹈柏林四國管制委員會之覆轍，主張愼重考慮。磋商再四，美國表示讓步，方得解決辦法，那便是將遠東顧問委員會改組爲遠東委員會，除原參加之中·美·英·法·澳洲·紐西蘭·加拿大·荷蘭·菲律賓及印度十國外，蘇蘇也一同參加。同時又成立了一個管制日本委員會，參加者有中·美·蘇·英·澳洲·紐西蘭和印度的聯合代表，由麥帥担任主席。遠東委員會乃對日管制的最高指導機關：舉凡大政方針，都可討論與決定，並得審查盟軍最高統帥的任何指令及揹施，然無執行及直接否決權。管制日本委員會與最高統帥商討及建議關於實現日本投降條款，其職權之規定如下：</p>
<p>一，盟軍統帥在頒發重大命令之前，需和該會商討。渠在此等事項上之決定有拘束力。</p>
<p>二，關於實現遠東委員會政策中之決定，其有關管制機構之改組，或日本政黨及政府之基本或重大改組等事項，如該委員會委員一人，與最高統帥表示異議，則最高統帥，在遠東委員會，對於此事未有協議之前，應暫緩頒發關於此等問題之命令。</p>
<p>三，如情勢需要，最高統帥經與盟國委會其他盟國代表，作初步磋商後，得作有關更動日本政府某一大臣或指派人選填充因某一內閣閣員辭職所遣之空缺。</p>
<p>遠東委員會於一九四六年二月二十六日，在華盛頓日大使館開幕，除常任主席由美代表麥考義担任外，並推定中國駐美大使魏道明，英駐美大使哈里法克斯及蘇駐美大使格羅米柯三人爲副主席。該會機構，設六個小組委員會：（一）戰犯委員會，主席爲我代表夏晋麟。（二）賠償委員會，主席爲澳代表艾格斯頓。（三）經濟金融委員會，主席爲英代表桑森。（四）憲法司法改革委員會，主席為印代表巴白。（五）加强民主趨勢委員會，主席爲蘇代表諾維科夫，我代表馬天則副之。（六）在日外僑委員會，主席爲法代表拉高斯特。後又設一解除日本軍備委員會。四月五日，管制日本委員會，在東京成立。</p>
<p>一九四五年七月廿六日美國又擬了一個中英美蘇四强解除日本武裝二十五年條約，以謀遠東和平的百年大計。其要點歸納起來，爲：（一）設立四强管制委員會，以監督日本解除武裝及國內不設防；（二）將日本所有海陸空三軍全部解除武裝，並須解散帝國大本營及參謀本部，不許設有軍事機構及半軍事機構，禁止製造及輸入軍械，曁不得設立海陸空根據地；（三）日本如有破壞或違反此項條約之行動時，簽約各國均須在海陸空三方面，採取必要行動，加以制止；但須將所採取之措置，報吿聯合國安全理事會；（四）條約有效時期限定爲二十五年，應於期滿前六個月內，召開四强會議，以決定此項條約有無修正或延長之必要，此約在通知中英蘇三國政府後，中英兩國，在原則上咸表贊同，惟蘇聯則認此舉爲向後倒退。</p>
<p>麥帥曾一再聲明，應使日本民主化，一而起草新憲法，一面組織政黨，準備大選。新政黨逐一產生，其中以代表保守派之自由黨和進步黨及左翼的社會主義黨爲最有力量。新憲法在幾番波折之下，於三月六日完成。</p>
<p>民選之後，處置日本的工作，應進入第二階段，計劃經濟自給，改革農村土地制度，革新社會組織，實施民治敎育。日本在大戰之後，農產减少，工廠停頓，發生極度之糧食與經濟恐慌。美曾決定運糧至日，各國均表示不滿，遠東委員會請其重行考慮，但已核准日本經濟自給的計劃，以一部分之出口貨物，換取外匯，購買農具肥料及各項原料。土地之改革，以扶植自耕農爲主；大地主所有之土地，應設法分予農民。</p>
<p>與管制日本有關的賠償問題，也頗費周章。美國曾遣賠款代表鮑萊至我國及日韓各地調査，作爲擬訂賠款之方針。麥帥將日本工業之全部財產目錄，送交鮑萊。惟美謂賠償之用意，在消滅日本的戰爭潛在力，應將日本工廠設備，移交太平洋各國，作爲賠款。但准許其保留其一部分輕工業，如紡織等事，以應經濟復興之需。工廠經指定拆運者，已有四百餘所。我國對日抗戰八年，破壞區域最廣，所受損失最重，則對於賠償之分配，自應享優越之權利，已擬就計劃書，寄交賠償委員會。鮑萊亦曾謂我國應享受較多之賠款。現一部分工廠，雖已拆運，而整個賠償計劃及分配，則尙待決定。關於日本領土，除准許其保有本土四島及其附屬之小島外，庫頁島南部及千島羣島，在雅爾達秘密協定中，割讓予蘇聯。台灣歸我國，朝鮮則獨立，所餘太平洋，代管各島，現在美軍佔領之下。美擬保留各島，以取得太平洋上的海軍控制權。但依聯合國憲章，並無指定美國有託管三羣島之義務，不過也沒有阻止美國的統制。論理在美國領導之下，推進世界和平，則統治這三小羣島，亦似適當，但將來不知有無反對者耳。</p>
<p>在麥帥領導下所進行的管制日本工作，均已分別進行，使日本走入一條新的途徑，但日本作戰的潛勢力，並未消滅。所謂新政黨，最有勢力的自由黨和進步黨，還不是民政黨和政友會的化身麽？解散財閥團體，不過是化整爲零，其力量並未减少。日本內閣從東久邇宮而幣原而吉田，都是過去附依軍閥的人物。最近發生的澀谷事件，表示其內心並未完全馴服。前在東京灣海底尋獲大批金銀，則其捲土重來之心，更昭然若揭，但美國仍一本寬大之態度，如准許日人出海捕魚，助其恢復工業，不僅影響中國建設，且可成爲復興日本之基礎，其危險孰甚？故今後管制日本，必須嚴格，辦法必求澈底。凡日本的種種戰爭潛在力，均須完全剷除，即足以發動戰爭的一切因素，亦應消滅，務使日本軍閥勢力歸於消滅，則遠東和平，庶有望焉。</p>

<h3>中國隱士與　中國文化</h3>
<p>— 水周</p>
<p>蔣星煜著　中華書局出版</p>
<p>在抗戰期間，像中國隱士與中國文化這一類的著作的確是不經見的；但是我終於在三十二年的中華書局渝版書目中發見了它。</p>
<p>因爲幾年來曾經蒐集了隱逸叢話小隱書高士傳一類的閒書，同時，覺得如要硏究中國的文化，要從心的底裏認識了中國文人學士的全貌，對於隱逸的思想，便非作一個歸納的研究不可。所以一看見了這一本書，就非常地注意，到了今天纔有機會細讀，眞是說不出的愉快。</p>
<p>作者把這一論題分做十章加以論述。其中第三·第六兩章有許多獨特的見解，第七章，對於隱士的地域分布的統計，可謂然費苦心，而且饒有興趣。第八第九兩章，有很精到的觀察。現在分述如下。</p>
<p>第一，臘舉隱士的見於經籍上的各種不同名稱，以定其範疇而正其名。這一章處理得稍爲冗漫一點，我以爲只要舉出各種異名及其定義，加以一個結論便可以不必另立一章。</p>
<p>第二，檢討隱士形成的因素。作者分析爲主觀的因素與客觀的因素二方面，主觀的因素又分個人主義的與不合作主義的，客觀的因素也分爲二，其一是由於傳統的逃避的哲學思想深入了士大夫階級。其二是由於中國社會是農業社會。分析得非常中肯。</p>
<p>第三區分中國隱士的類型。這一章我覺得最爲謹嚴。不過以伯夷爲虛僞的隱士，似乎還有可以商討的地方。</p>
<p>第四第五是叙述隱士的政治生活與經濟生活。經他這麼一加以綜合的描述，使我們對於隱士的心理現象更加淸楚。</p>
<p>第六叙述隱士的社會生活。它的結論是：「中國社會受了隱士的孤高自賞的流毒，所以人各行其是，苦難不能共當，歡樂不能同享，這是値得我們猛省的。」說得非常中肯。</p>
<p>第七統計隱士的地域分佈。這是全書最精彩的一章。雖然他僅以名山爲經，作歷代隱士的地城統計，似乎還不够正確；但這究竟是自出心裁的一種創作，很値得重視。</p>
<p>第八·第九兩章是叙述隱士與繪畫詩歌的關係。在這裏我驚異於作者的博學與明辨，這兩章簡直可作山水畫史及田園詩史看。文字也特別淸新爽利。</p>
<p>第十叙述中國學者怎樣批判中國隱士。而最後作者「大聲疾呼」：「勇敢地生活，不做隱士。」表明了作者積極的態度。全書大略如此。</p>
<p>對於隱士的評價，我的私見很有些與作者不同的地方。古人說：「人各有志」，爲什麽有許多不同的「志」呢？因爲身體有强弱，血型有不同，遺傳有影響，此外社會與家庭環境的殊異，所受的敎育的良窳，在在都是影響到一個人的「志」。有其「才」者不必有其「志」，譬如諸葛君有王佐之才，但在未遇蜀先主之前，寗躬畊以養一志」，是爲隱逸之正宗。陶淵明歸去來辭中有云：「旣自以心爲形役，奚惆悵而獨悲？」「心」即是「志」，所以隱逸之士便是以心役形的人，非至不得已之時，不肯「降心以相從」，是即所謂「麋鹿之性」。但如在國家危急之時，也要「當仁不讓」凡是眞隱君子都是如此。作者所舉的呂尙，伊尹，傳說與伯夷稽康陶宏景實際上我以爲並無什麼分別。</p>
<p>總之，這是一本難得的好書，雖然有些地方仍嫌不够精密。</p>

<p>時代是不住地前進着，靑年們的思潮也跟着它而前進，現代的靑年，除了看一些文藝書籍而外，他們也注意了與切身有關的政治經濟科學的書籍。</p>
<p>誠然，在這時代是隨時在轉變着，靑年們不得不讀一些新科學的書籍，而使之瞭解這世界，痛悟自己將來爲祖國應如何地努力！</p>
<p>現在，我在這裏向諸位介紹一本値得看的書籍。那就是吳恩裕的「馬克斯的政治思想」。</p>
<p>我們對於馬克斯的看法，正如這書的作者所說：旣不取感情上的贊成態度，也不取感情上的反對態度，祗是對他的學說，做純粹學術的硏究。</p>
<p>作者吳恩裕，曾留英得學位，原文是用英文寫出，後與其夫人宋漱青女士，合譯成這本中文本。在本書中，分析馬克斯所有關於方法·哲學·歷史·經濟·政治·倫理各方面的理論，取材方面，涉及馬克斯生平所有的著作。</p>
<p>在第一章「方法與方法論」裏，它吿訴我們研究法的工具是歸納·分析·比較·觀察·和實騐；硏究的對象之「眞實的生命」在被「描摹」後，無論描摹的怎樣成功，也不能不失掉其「生動氣一。</p>
<p>馬克斯以爲在社會現象的研究中，以下三項是主要工具：（一）事實的「分析」或利用「抽象能力」；（二）「面對事實」及「比較事實」；（三）推求社會上層結構之歷史經濟動機的方法·關於這三項工具，它都有分別的說明。</p>
<p>馬克斯與黑格爾的哲學派別，它也闡明了，並將形式邏輯作詳細的說明。</p>
<p>第二·三章中，它說明了馬克斯哲學的特性；反形上學的論據，馬克斯哲學的應用範圍及「唯物論」的意義，唯物史觀的考證與解釋。</p>
<p>第四章，「革命理論闡微」，它述出革命。法律。與實際需要，革命理論與革命實踐的統一，無產階級革命論；這些都說得扼要明白。</p>
<p>第五章中，是馬克斯評康德及邊沁，關於評康德的理論，它是這樣二個步叙：（一）康德的倫理及政治學說述略，（二）馬克斯的批評。</p>
<p>關於邊沁的功利學說，也分二步：（一）邊沁功利學說之一般的性質；（二）馬克斯對於這種學說的批評。</p>
<p>最後一章，是「論道德與人性」；首先是道德·效率·與內在的必然，及資本主義社會中之倫理關係及倫理學的分析·特徴，同時對於善·惡·正當·不正當，等觀念之不同點，甚至矛盾的解釋。</p>
<p>末尾，斯賓諾莎，盧梭，邊沁，康德，及馬克斯的人性論，它作了一個比較的敍述。</p>
<p>全書共分六章，把馬克斯的思想述得很詳細，並不限於「政治」的。</p>
<p>當然，我祇能把它作一簡單的介紹，並不能再詳細的闡述，諸位要看這一切馬克斯的學術思想，這本書是很好的一本。</p>
<p>硏究馬克斯的學說在現代靑年們中是比較流行的一件事。祗是一般所謂以指導思想自任的先生們把馬克斯的學說當成了信仰的對象。於是他們祗是宣傳主義，而不是硏究學術。吳先生這本著作可以作爲硏究馬氏理論的好榜樣，它裏面祗有平心靜氣的硏究，祗有引經據典的註脚，而沒有口號或宣傳的口頭禪。其次近來一般研究馬氏學說的人們除了有關於馬氏的著作之外外，其他書籍似乎是不屑一讀。吳先生硏究馬氏學說自有其整個的哲學根基，他是從各家學說中硏究馬氏，這綐是做學問的方法。最後本書還有一個好處，它避免了一般硏究馬克斯者的那樣攏統模糊的習慣，作者把馬氏學說中幾個重要的名辭如「生產方法」，「下層基礎」，上層建築」，「決定」，「必然地」等都給以精密的分析和詳盡的闡明。作者的結論我們雖不一定完全接受，但他的研究方法是値得讀者學習的。</p>
<p>我不再贅言了，希望諸位除看文藝著作之外，也看看自身很有益的政治經濟書籍，以純粹客觀與硏究爲原則，去看這一切有益的書，以期造成中國眞正的新青年，共向創造新中國之途邁進！</p>
<h3>「我選擇了自由」</h3>
<p>— 華</p>
<p>維克泰·格拉夫靑科著　紐約出版</p>
<p>Victor　Kravchenko　∶“I　Chose　Freedom”</p>
<p>Charles　Scriber’s　Sons，1946</p>
<p>這是一部很有意思的自述。作者本是一位蘇聯的長官。他在這部書內，把未出國前的生活，為黨服務的經歷，和奉派至美，思想轉變的由來，很老實地寫了下來。</p>
<p>一九四四年四月四日，維克泰·格拉夫青科在華盛頓突然脫　了蘇聯的購料委員會。當時全美的報紙，都揭載着這條消息，轟動一時。</p>
<p>他在自跋中說：「他脫離了購料委員會以後，便冒着生命上的危險，來寫這部書。他從這一家宿舍，逃到那一家宿舍，從這一個城市，逃到那一個城市，隱姓埋名，避人耳目。」</p>
<p>他說明「他脫離的原因，決不是偶然的，而是長期考慮的結果。」</p>
<p>他又說：「當我脫離購料委員會時，大戰還進行着。西方民主國家必須和我國合作。我只有竭力抑制着自己·共同的勝利，該比任何事情都緊要，我也自願三緘其口。但現在是勝利了，我不妨詳詳細細，坦坦白白，切切實實地寫出來給人看。並且這也正是我的責任。」</p>
<p>「我國內的人民。不能把他們的意見，他們的希望，他們的痛苦，說給人知道。所以我要揭破一切，警吿人們，勿再自欺欺人。」</p>
<p>「我們國內，連一點最小限度的經濟和政治上的自由，都不曾有，却要人家相信在我們的組織中，也有一種所謂「自由一，所謂「民主」，似乎和「舊式」的民主，有點不同。」</p>
<p>他於一九〇五年，生在烏克蘭（Ukraine）的亞喀脫林諾斯拉夫（Yekaterinoslav）地方，從小便長育在反對帝制的空氣中；他父親是個革命黨。在一九一七年，他曾見過那很混亂的局面，艱苦的生活，嚴重的內戰。一九二九年，才正式入黨。</p>
<p>他是一位冶金技術家，對於黨的工作，也很熱心。他說他信仰上的搖動是起源於「集團化」的時候，那時接着來了一個大荒年，心中開始懷疑的，也不止他一人。二次大戰開始，他在紅軍中當工程師，接着便替人民委員會辦事，最後派赴美國。</p>
<p>他是一個愛國主義者。他所提出的問題，是一個値得考慮的問題。</p>
<p>原書是用俄文寫的，英文本曾經他親自校閱過。</p>
<h3>草原故事</h3>
<p>— 高爾基作·巴金譯　艾嘉</p>
<p>巴金在他所譯的「草原故事」裏，前面曾提起席尼特金（H．T．Schnitkind）所說的話：「世界最偉大最耐久的東西，就是做夢的人的手工成績。不能做夢的行動的人，便是毁壞世界者：他們是興敦堡一流的人物；這些野蠻的力量，要留點痕跡在時間之沙上面，除非先把時間之沙浸透了人血。只有像高爾基和託爾斯太那般善於做夢的人，才能够從海洋與陸地的材料中，建造出一個仙話，才能够從專制與受苦的混亂中，創造出一個自由人的國土來。」</p>
<p>高爾基（Maxim　Gorky）這位偉大的製夢者，在他的「草原故事」（StoriesofSteppe）中，寫了三個新奇而又有力的仙話：（一）馬加爾週達（二）因了單調的原故（三）不能死的人。</p>
<p>按着「草原故事」的命名，很容易使我們聯想到許多美麗的塲面：在很遠很遠的地方，一片原始空曠的原野上，到處長滿了沁香的綠草，江河溪水就緩緩地在牠的四週流逝而過，這裏居住着的人們應該常常是歡愉的，他們每天工作着，休息着，帶着辛勞後的笑容，張望自己在陽光中發亮的家；他們的牛羊就在附近地帶，低下頭，默默地吃草……草原上的一切該是這樣優美，柔和；生命充滿了安恬。可是高爾基不讓我們想像得如此美善；他從遼遠的平原帶來了凄厲的寒風；黑暗裏，海水低低的私語；還有那些可歌可泣的夢與事實；是的，就在這一片廣闊無垠的草原上；一對年輕的吉普賽男女，爲着秉性的自尊和自由死去了。佐拔兒殺去他所崇愛的姑娘；她的父親又刺死了他；「馬加爾周達」中的「娜達」，就這樣「握着她自由一縷黑髪，圓睜着遲鈍無光的眼睛，望着天空，她的脚下，躺着佐拔兒美麗的身軀，他的頭髮蓋着他的臉」；最珍貴的鮮血；把草原沾濕了。此外「因了單調的原故」一羣孤獨的人們，耐不住荒原岑寂，他們就想從別人的身上找取刺激和快樂；他們犯下了罪；可憐醜陋的廚娘阿利娜，終於殺害了自己，那被沾汚的軀體，便埋葬在草原裏面……還有，那喚做「拉拿」的「不能死的人」，因爲自負和驕傲，被懲罰「永遠活下去」，「他沒有伴侶，孤獨地在人們居住的地方，飄蕩了萬千年」，「不能死」的酷刑使他變成顫動的影子，在草原上徨徬——直到以後的永遠永遠。</p>
<p>高爾基是一位偉大的製夢者，他在你還沒有知道的時候，早已織成了草原的夢，他的愛和憎，他的思想與哲理，他的渴望，他對於任何一件事物的祈求，他的喜悅及悲哀；在這裏，奏出了悒鬱而雋永的心曲；他說：「這一切（草原上的）——香哪，雲哪，星哪，人哪——在這芳香的，金黃色的黃昏中，都帶着一種迷人的美閃耀着；然而却有一種形容不出，悲哀的空氣籠罩了一切的東西，好像在一篇仙話開塲時一般。一切都是活的，而且是和諧美麗的；然而同時似乎有一隻死神的手要抓住他們，好像牠們燦爛的生長就會突然停止似的，這種生活缺乏着實際生活的與奮活動；牠沒有那些具有着潛伏生長的聲音。可是這時候送到我耳邊的聲音，已經微弱而斷續了，當牠們慢慢兒逝去的時候，牠們好像變成了柔和的嘆息——追悔與渴望的歎息。渴望着什麼呢？也許是幸福——那不可捉模的，不可知的海市蜃樓，人間的幸福吧？……這些音調在空中飄盪的時候，我正充滿了異想天開的欲望。我願意我可以化作灰塵，那麼，我就可以被風吹散到四面八方。我很願意像一股暖的水流，琉進大海，然而再化爲水氣飛到美麗的雲彩中間，我願意我，而且只有我一個身子能够滲透那整個悲哀的，魔術的夜，我這時很憂鬱，自己也不知道這是什慶緣故。……</p>
<p>生活需要熱情，需要夢，需要强烈的愛與恨；在都市的狹籠裏，人們的心被渴望重壓着，他們所能聽到，看到，接觸到的，是一種單純的生之動態，他們何嘗不期待眺望一下，鐵欄外有着綠色田野的地方；在那裏，還有年老的人用了悲愴敎誨的口吻，在追述從前那些動人的故事。</p>

<h3>一個講法語的　阿根廷作家</h3>
<p>— 大椿</p>
<p>如果要在講西班牙語的南美找一個法蘭西魂的代表，那麽非談談維多利亞·渥康樸夫人（Victoria）不可。這位女作家的早年是在巴黎度過的，她在孩提時代就念法語。所以，後來在紙上毫無缺點地寫出效思想時，筆底自然地湧出那些法文字。可是，渥康樸夫人底精神活動的中心地却並不在法國，因爲她究竟是出身於阿根廷。旣然籍貫是阿根廷，她必須向講着西班牙語的同胞說話。</p>
<p>渥康樸夫人所撰著的評論，散文等，起初都用法文寫成，隨後又小心地譯成淸楚的加斯蒂爾文，在這種方式下，才可在本國出版。祇有一本著作是先用西班牙文出版後，再用法文問世的。關於此事，作者曾在評論集法蘭西談話（Paroles　for—angaise）一書中剖白過。</p>
<p>渥康樓夫人曾在故國寫了許多討論諾雅葉夫人（Anna　deNoailles）普羅司脫（Proust），范徠利（Valers）等法國名作家的文章。她所著的證據（Temoignages）一書，是精密搜求的菓子，書中描述三種靈魂：法蘭西的，英吉利的和西班牙的。她底重要著作有：淮爾夫（Virginia　Woolf），亞朗鐸公司（Orlando　et　Cie），白朗蒂（Emily　Brante），在海德公園裏的星期日（Dimanches　a　Hyde　Park），靈與血的最上權（Supremate　de　I＇ame　et　du　sang），婦人和她底表情（La　femme　et　sonexpression）和自法朗賽司加至拜阿脫呂斯（De　Francesca　a　Beatrice）等。</p>
<p>她的故鄉是阿京倍諾斯愛勒，她在那裏創辦了一個文藝刋，物，叫做（Sur，樣式與歐洲的最好的刋物一樣，該刋經常發表些歐洲名作家的作品，法人中有范徠利，克勞台（Claudel），紀德，英人中有蕭伯納，赫胥黎，西班牙人中有馬辣儂（Maranon），奧格賽（Ortegay　Gasset），阿根廷作家中，常爲該刋撰稿的有莫利耶（Eduardo　Mallea），愛洛（LnisAlberto　Erro，勃那台慈（Bernardez）和徐隆鐸（OliverioGirondo）等。</p>
<p>渥康樸夫人在年輕時就醉心於文學，在那個時代她曾設：「我唯一的奢望是有一天會寫作，寫得好不好，在所不計，因爲我不過是一個女子。我聽說一個女子不能照了男子的格式來表露她底思想和情感，並且她不會以男子的聲音來說話。」這些話她說錯了，在當代的阿根廷，她已超越了男作家，她的作品是成功的，並且具有國際性的。</p>
<p>她差不多每年要往巴黎去逗留幾時。他在作客的時日裏，出席她所願到的會議，拜訪幾個她所崇拜的作家，聽聽音樂，或者閱讀些她所喜歡的書籍。</p>
<p>短篇小說</p>
<h3>九月衣裳（下）</h3>
<p>— 素人</p>
<p>我緊緊執住她溫暖的手，說不出話來。妻實在太好了，也太可憐了。她自嫁我將近一年，我並沒有給她最好的享受，甚至除了零星物件，我也沒有送她一樣首飾，或者替她製一件新衣。只有她常常簽明我的心事，不聲不響替我買好想買而未買的東西，不論是一本書，或者一張手絹，這都是她自己的錢。她也從未向我要過一個錢，甚至經常開支她也常常墊付了，還不肯吿訴我。她有女性罕有的純潔的靈魂和一顆忠恕的心，曼妙的外形與溫柔的性格。至此我認女性是世上最偉大同時也最　人的東西，雖然也許有一個少數的例外。</p>
<p>「究竟是怎麽一回事？」我到底說了話。</p>
<p>「不是很平常，我替你做了兩套衣服，因爲恐怕你自己忘記了，大冷起來沒衣服穿。」</p>
<p>怕我忘記？難道我眞是如此糊塗？她會不會在諷刺我？</p>
<p>「我並沒有忘記，但是我失敗了，所以裝做不曾說過這句話，而且希望你也忘記，這樣子混過去就算了。現在……」</p>
<p>「好　，別說了，難道你我之間，為了　　一件小事，也須這許多解釋？」</p>
<p>我點點頭，她笑着拉我坐下，我們靠在一起，不用說話，讓心靈在靜默中的傾訴代替了。</p>
<p>良久，她問我：</p>
<p>「你袋裏硬硬的一圈是什麽</p>
<p>我猛然憶起，這正是我獻手鐲給她的好機會，以酬贈衣的　情，我把它取出來托在掌心，托到她眼前，笑說：</p>
<p>「特地送給我的妻子，讓它和原有的配成一對，快取出來，看看配得上配不上。」</p>
<p>她離開我，坐起來，怔怔地望着，輕聲說：</p>
<p>「我沒有」。</p>
<p>「我見過的，好像和道一個差不多」。</p>
<p>「不錯，我有過這樣一只手鐲，但我把它賣掉了」我看看她，仔細聽她說下去：「至於賣來的錢，就是這兩套衣服」。</p>
<p>「我更應感謝你，爲了我的衣服，你賣去了心愛的東西」。</p>
<p>「但我要怎樣謝你，因爲你把它又買回來了」。</p>
<p>「有這樣事，眞的」？我瞪大了眼睛。</p>
<p>「眞的，一些也不錯」她接過那隻手鐲撫摩着：「我認得每一條玉紋，每一絲綠意，謝謝你。我，你化了多少錢」？</p>
<p>「沒有化一個銅板」。</p>
<p>「爲什麽」？她把手鐲套在腕上，仔細地端詳。</p>
<p>「朋友送給我，說是作爲我們未來的孩子的見儀」。</p>
<p>「啊，我正要吿訴你」她湊到我耳邊（其實房間裏沒有第三個人）「眞的我們快要有孩子了」！</p>
<p>我喜歡得跳起來，拉住她，她對我擠擠眼，我們擁住了踏着零亂的脚步起舞，舞盡了每種曲子，舞遍了房間的每一個角落，直等兩人的額上都有些濕潤，才停下了，重重地倒在床上，她枕着枕頭，我靠在她胸前：</p>
<p>「再是幾個月呢」？</p>
<p>「明年春天，就可以做父親了。」</p>
<p>「難道你不是做母親？」</p>
<p>沉默了許久以後，我說：</p>
<p>「事情眞是巧合，誰能料得到朋友會買了你賣出去的東西，竟會送給我，而我恰好拿回來送你。」</p>
<p>「好像是上天特地造成的一個循環，來搬弄我們這一班無知的愚人，它却在一旁看着笑。」</p>
<p>「別講道些了」，我舉手勾住她的頭頸。</p>
<p>「你不喜歡我的迷信是不是」？</p>
<p>「不，我以爲女人最好女性化一些，而迷信則似乎是女性的專利，只要不大過份，我是喜歡的。不過你說得人類太可憐了，世人雖說愚笨得令人可笑，但我們至少還能把握住當前的生命，包括了歡樂與愁恨，沒有自私和欺騙，無愧地安穩渡過這一生」</p>
<p>她點點頭，溫柔地撫摩我的頭髮，我伸手滅了當中的大燈，只有壁燈發出微弱的絳色的光，我抬眼看她正俯下頭來，於是微微的一些矜持都在相視一笑中消失了。</p>
<h3>好與好看</h3>
<p>— 中原</p>
<p>好與好看，照字面看來，似不應該有多大距離。但事實上，「好」是一件事，「好看」又是一件事。「好」的東西不一定「好看」，「好看」的東西不一定是「好」。</p>
<p>我買了一塊印花人造縐衣料，大家讚着好看，但是大家又說：「僅好看而已，一落水可就完了！」我買了一塊溫州土布，大家讚着堅牢，但是大家又說：「牢雖牢，不過太不好看了。」</p>
<p>東西如此，文章又何嘗不然。</p>
<p>前幾天一位朋友吿訴我一件事，說她在看一部非常出名的俄國小說，因爲事前她在報章雜誌上，見到過許多盛讚那部小說的文章，所以特爲出空身體，預備把一星期時間，完全放在那一部小說裏，寫寫意意地享受一星期。不料第一天翻開書來，只看了二頁，頭裏就一抽一抽的作痛了。結果那部小說雖勉强看完，然而竟像吃了一個星期官司。</p>
<p>這的確是一種悲哀，許多風聞好久的大作家的名作，許多意義偉大的詩文小說，拿到手裏來一看，非但艱澀無味，一點不好看，有時候不客氣，簡直完全看不懂！</p>
<p>當然這是由於讀者的程度太淺，不能够領會作者潛伏在文章後面的深奧意義。不過我總以爲，文章的功用，就是要使人懂，文章之所以印在紙上，就是要普遍。一篇深奧過度的文章，固然能博得程度較深的大人先生讚美，然而此類大人先生，到底是屬於於少數吧？</p>
<p>「好」的東西不一定「好看」，但我很希望「好」的文章能一定「好看」！當然這裏所說的「好看」，是指點文章的形式「容易看」和「動看」，並不是叫作者用淺薄的內容去迎合一般低級趣味。</p>
<h3>夏</h3>
<p>— 吳俊發刻</p>
<h3>家與田園</h3>
<p>— 路青</p>
<p>夜裏，我常常寂寞起來。</p>
<p>燈燃着一朵火燄，然而火燄却幽暗得像一朶枯萎的花；有時候風吹過，燈火顫抖起來，又彷彿是一個姑娘的眼，悲哀地眨着一眶子淚，有所申訴地看着我，却又沒有一句話。</p>
<p>這怎能予我以溫熱與安慰呢？我在深夜的領域裏遐思了——家與田園啊，我本來也是個受愛撫的孩子……</p>
<p>家園嗎？我的家園才是美麗的哪！讓我唱給你聽吧，那一個故鄉之歌故鄕，我生長的地方，本來是一個天堂。</p>
<p>那兒有淸澈的河流映着垂楊，那兒有茂密的林松擁着小小的山岡；春天，新綠的草原有牛羊來往，秋天，那木葉燦爛輝煌。</p>
<p>月夜，我們曾泛舟湖上，也曾在古寺之旁幾次憑吊過斜陽……</p>
<p>然而，如今我是不愛唱這個歌了——因爲我想起了的故鄉，確是比這更其美麗的一個地方。</p>
<p>藍的湖波，湖上藍的天。柳叢裏嫣紅的碧桃花開的時節，碧桃樹下，却開起了更嫣紅的說不來的名字的草花。星星散在夏晚的天空，紅的小花散上湖堤的綠茵。</p>
<p>「靈性花開詩人筆」，詩人原是能體茹人問許多深深的哀傷，能畫出生命的岡形的。然而，在那兒永遠寗靜的湖邊，永不死亡的一代代生命的延續裏；在看見了人間所沒有的那美麗的顏色與詞句，想到了超越人類所思忖得到的那奧秘時：詩人也應該爲了發現自身的醜陋而惘然地流淚。</p>
<p>討人筆是永也描不像這一幅自然的岡畫的啊——無邊深邃的天，無邊深邃的湖；天上一朶雲，地上一莖草，都包含了無邊深邃的神秘。</p>
<p>我該是多末驕傲——故鄉，我生長的地方，而這地方是無上美麗的。</p>
<p>斜陽影裏，趕上山顚去看晚烟暮景。或者，盪着船兒到湖心去等待月亮升上來，用銀的光芒替我畫一筆銀的山河。</p>
<p>那日子我是够幸福的，然而我沉醉在幸福裏，幾曾想到今天的苦難；那日子我整天歌唱，讓愉快的歌聲漾在湖面，然而我生活在甜蜜的夢裏，又幾曾想到今天我會用那樣悵惘失望的低音發聲唱歌；那日子我爬在山上，跑在堤上，我是愛淘氣的終日不息地奔走着，然而我踏慣的畢竟是平坦的，兩旁散開着星星一樣的花朶的路，我又幾曾想到今天，跑得疲乏了，在衣服被撕裂了，脚趾被刺出了血時，却還有不盡的滿長荆棘的路擺在我面前。</p>
<p>那日子我不懂人們爲什麼要嘆息，而我更又幾曾想到今天，我自己也嘆息了，不住地，我的心炙熱而憂痛……</p>
<p>流浪了，像一縷靑烟那末輕輕地飄出了家園。</p>
<p>於是在一條沒有盡頭的路上，我看見了大風雪，看見了死亡；我學會了嘆息，和默默地，默默地想。</p>
<p>（想那遙遠的地方，想那遙遠的歲月）。</p>
<p>因爲我今天所能驕傲的，只是這經越了千山萬水的路程却依然被我緊緊地背負着的記憶之囊了；我今天所能自慰的，只是在這囊中珍藏着的無數幀岡畫與一章永遠是甜蜜的童年的史詩。</p>
<p>我也想再畫起許多生命的岡形來，重新採下我靑春的花菓，然而異鄕的大風雪畢竟幾次地掩埋了我這一個微弱的生機。這樣，我又默默地想起來了——</p>
<p>家與田園啊，我本來也是個受愛撫的孩子……</p>
<h3>一寸山河一寸血</h3>
<p>— 葉勁風</p>
<p>第一卷七封秘緘</p>
<p>這七封秘緘，關係全世界的安寗，和無數千萬人的生命，財產。相信國際間能够揭發這七封秘械的人，可說寥寥無幾，而願意揭發的人，也許祇我一個。單單揭發，並無重大意義，相反的，也許要激怒那主動的幾座魔星，幹出更可怕更歹毒的勾當來。所以我現在的計劃，第一步，先要設法把這七封秘件的內容，偵察到手；第二步，竭盡我一切的權力，把羣魔的計劃，澈底破壞。萬一辦不到這一步，那也只好看事行事，做些挽救的工作了。同志，努力罷！三〇七</p>
<p>第一章　一雙新鮮血輸</p>
<p>「古君：兩次的要求，您都沒給我一個肯定的答覆。這封信，就是我最後的一次要求。無論順而，或是反面，您總得給我指定一條路。報紙裏面的報導，那樣的糢，愈看愈叫人糊塗。北平的這羣報館編輯，太圓淤，太外交官化了。可是我的　覺，早叫我聞到了一股濃厚的火藥氣味。這，並非指着前幾天宛平和蘆溝橋的那幾陣槍砲；我是說的整個的東方，也許整個的世界……我感覺到一種莫名的興奮，時，也感覺到一種說不出的悽惶。古君，　家族關係說，您知道我是一個伶仃的　　　　社會的立塲看，我是一個孤零零的　　　。我也認清了敵人，也瞧見了同清們隊伍的標幟，更知道一塲劇烈的長期鬥爭，快要發動了，可是單單沒有給我一個適雷的機會，挑選一個適當的崗位……。古君，承您的好意，鼓勵指導我，如何學習，如何上進。我的學程，現在總算可以吿一個段落了。感激的言語，我想您也不願聽，而且也不是一點感激的意念，就可結束我們之間的關係的。從您這幾年對於我種種的關切來分析，敢說您必定懸有一個相當重要的目標，（請恕我過分直率）。從我所知道您的一點情狀看，　必是需要很多可靠的助手。可是我兩决三番的請求，您老是保持着一種拒人千里的態度。這一點，我始終不能明瞭。古君，我要求您給我一個肯定的答覆——注意，這是我最後一次的請求！……！」</p>
<p>我看到這裏，便放下了這厚厚的一疊信箋，怔怔地瞧着鶴見玉，很想替這位寫信的女孩子，在他身上，找出一個滿意的答覆來。</p>
<p>他就坐在我對面，我們當中隔着一張大方桌，他兩隻手捧住臉，手肘撑在桌面上。他這雙肌肉墳起，靑筋鼓張，汗毛　轉的膀膊，和他那張神釆俊爽的而容，相形之下，恰恰成了一個十分調合的對照。上唇蓄一撮小鬚，修飾得很整齊，更襯得他年輕，一雙眼睛，秀麗，而又冷冷地含着一股威嚴。我抬起頭來瞧他的時候，他也正注視着我，很耐性的等候我的意見。</p>
<p>「怎麽樣？」他的嗓音雖是壓得很低，仍舊極其剛勁，「看下去罷。」</p>
<p>「不行，問題太多了，我得…我得硏究硏究你們倆的關係」。我始終怔怔地瞧着他。</p>
<p>他搖搖頭，有些耐不住的神情，揑起一雙拳頭，在桌上輕輕擂了一下，霍地起身，在屋子裏，來回踱着。</p>
<p>這時正是快要上燈的時候，我們這座房子，地方極其僻靜，全院子十幾間屋子，住着十多個人，可一點聲音都沒有，靜得像深山的古廟一般。</p>
<p>本來長辛店這地方，是個半利半鎭的局面。幸虧平漢路電務處的總廠設在這裏，又有一條小鐵道通着豐臺，居然也養活着一條小市面的小街道。靠着這條小街和鐵廠吃飯的，小半住在臨街，大部分却散住在四面的小村莊裏；當然這些村子的住戶都是耕田種地的。</p>

<h3>藝術家的頭發髮</h3>
<p>— 張沭么</p>
<p>在十九歲的時候，曾經一度熱中於做詩人的夢想。一面埋頭閉戶寫一些花呀月呀的詩，一面積極留長頭髮，想表示一位詩人的風度。但頭髮尙未長及後頸　，却給母親一陣嘰咕，强迫着去剃短了。那時，不敢昂首闊步聲明自己是個詩人，一股兒牢騷祗好壓在肚裏。</p>
<p>後來流浪到後方，脫下長衫，穿上軍服，跋山涉水了幾年，又一　當當小公務員，整日　　撲在生活的逆流裏；但做詩人的夢幷未减損一分，反而更加熱烈起來。但那時留蓬蓬鬆鬆長髮的希望，已經打破了。大概年事稍長，對藝術的看法另有一種尺度，加之，記得魯迅先生曾經大駡過打紅頭帶，穿奇衣怪服，三月不刮鬍髭，留鬢髮，蓄長達耳墜的頭髮的冒牌藝術家，自己有點寒心了！</p>
<p>這次回到上海，有幸遇見一位在後方某城市噪名一時的音樂家；第一次見面握手，跳進眼睛的是一頭長及耳墜的頭髮，兩　迎風飄揚的鬢髮和一張不健康的臉，宛如十九歲時所崇拜的藝　家偶像，赫然活生生地立在眼　了。但是，說實話，當時給我的印象，實在有點嚕囌；一個天賦很厚的藝術家在我心中頓時矮了一截！</p>
<p>之後往返熟了，母親當然十分看不慣這一頭風姿綽然的　　，終於忍不住問了：「你的頭髮爲什麽留得這樣長？怪膩人的一。他唱出了一排整齊的牙齒，　細了眼，笑着答：「嘻嘻，藝術家呀！藝術家是這種頭髮　」！這吳裏話裏的意思：你老太婆　根兒不知道藝術的偉大，大驚小怪的，這種頭髮唯藝術家才該有，否則誰知道我是個音樂家呢！幷且他將眼睛丟給我，意思要我表示點意見，我惶恐地只得隨和着說：「是的，是的，藝術家都如此蓄髮的」！</p>
<p>我相信，天道樣熱，那麽一大堆頭髮壓着，那位先生不致於會感到凉快輕鬆吧？一頭髮的凡士林，要太太不勝其煩地洗枕頭套，也有點過意不去；不如剪短點，又凉快，又省事，何樂而不爲呢？</p>
<p>可是這位先生爲什麽愛惜他的長而不美的頭髮呢？我想了想；是了，唯恐人家不知道他是超人一等的藝術家呀，巴爾扎克慣於穿着彩色怪服，招搖過市，十八世紀的一些著名音樂大家的遺像，盡是那麽長曳的風流長髮。所以現代我們那些尙未知名於後世的藝術家當然該先從頭髮摹傚起；問題就在這兒，先將著名不著名丟在一邊。十八世紀的女人裝飾是穿蓋沒脚趾，寬如大木桶的裙子，而現代的女子呢？却穿越短越好的衣裙了。不過重點還不在此；一個眞牌貨的藝術家倒不在乎極力摹做前輩的外形，應着重於藝術的造詣。一個懂得藝術使命和尊嚴的人，應該憎惡外表的特殊化，好像指着鼻子在大街上，大聲宣稱：「我是個藝術家呀！」但那種虛榮心。學藝術是件艱苦的工作，外表是和常人無異的，根本不會有比黃包車夫高出一等的榮耀。我相信巴爾札克和那時的音樂大家如果生在現代，頂多也不過穿一套平常的白帆布西裝，頭髮薙得短短的。</p>
<p>尤其假如你尙未在藝術園地建下功勳，可不要來這套；中國有句俗話：「金玉其外，敗絮其中。」頗值得你我警惕。即使已經建下不朽功勳了，更其不該如是作；只要你是眞正虛懷若谷地埋頭在藝術創作中，不蓄風流長髪，人家也會崇拜你，不因你是光頭或短髪而減低了對你的尊敬。反之，人家當面不說，背後怕不說你一句：「冒牌的空頭藝術家」呀！</p>
<h3>賣　人頭　血的交易在南美</h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>在南美洲厄瓜多爾的首都基多，我在旅館中醒來，發現有人在我的臉前提着一個女人的頭。基多位於海平綫上九千五百呎。初到的人本已覺到呼吸不爽，經此一吓，雖未致死，但幾乎無法呼吸。客廳中黯淡的燈光，從開着的門射進我的黑暗的臥室，照着一個婦女的臉，靠近着我的臉—一陣沙嗄的聲音急切的說：「先生！光生！五十塊錢！非常便宜！」</p>
<p>那個人手中提着的人頭確是一個眞的少女的頭，她的美而長的黑髮可以證實。這頭髮是難以假造的。</p>
<p>南美印地安人如何將人頭中的骨頭取出，並將它縮小至活着時的四分之一大小，始終是世界的神秘之一。</p>
<p>今日，在南美洲安達斯山脈一帶，你可能秘密的買到這種人頭。在哥倫比亞國的波巴羊城，有一位化學家有三顆人頭要賣給我，每顆價値是三十五元，但是我爲了兩種理由沒有買：第一，我迷信那稱人頭，會帶給我惡運。第二，當時我正啓程到厄瓜多爾去，而厄國政府査到携帶那種人頭的人要罰款四百元。</p>
<p>到南美去旅行的人，差不多都要買一顆人頭帶回國去炫耀。厄國政府說，向印地安人買人頭會鼓勵他們「增加道種人頭供應」</p>
<p>當我離開基多，越過安達斯山到達太平洋岸的瓜亞基爾港時，還有人向我呌賣人頭。</p>
<p>這是在輪船的甲板上，已經通過了厄國海關，假如我買下來，也不會受到罰鍰。</p>
<p>一個土人走上甲板來，在他的衣內藏着一顆人頭。但是我們就爲了惡運的迷信沒有買它。</p>
<p>「這是慘劇」，在甲板上與我一同飲酒的輪船公司的職員對我說：「它是紅頭髮的嗎？大約一年前我們有一個夥伴失蹤了。他是到某地去的，我們時常想他也許被印地安人抓去了。」</p>
<p>我哭了起來，但同座的船長並沒有哭，他在南美西海岸航行已近三十年了，當他吿訴我一個德國人失頭的故事之後，我明白了他不哭的理由。</p>
<p>這個德國人是一個年老的人類學家，頭禿得如鷄蛋一樣，他的臉上有一條從面頰直劃到耳部的刀痕。</p>
<p>他的最好和最老的朋友是一個英國人，他是一家海岸錢輪船公司的退休了的經理。一天，他將這老德國人類學家送到了秘魯去。</p>
<p>這德國人離開了秘魯，他說：「我要穿越安達斯山到伊規托斯去。也許要去幾年，因爲要等我知道了印地安人如何縮小人頭的秘密才回來。」</p>
<p>兩年沒有聽到他的消息。一天，當那英國人坐在他的寄碇在秘魯考老港的輪船的甲板上時，有一個孩子拿了一張紙條走上來了，紙條是考老城內一家古董店的老闆寫的，他請這英國人到岸上去一次。他去了。</p>
<p>「很好」，那老闆說：「他在這裏」。</p>
<p>那英國人將他的老朋友的頭拿到手裏。一點不錯——刀痕和禿頂。</p>
<p>「這顆頭」，古董店的老闆搓着手快樂的說：「你的老遊伴的，你出多少錢？」</p>
<p>那英國人痛恨的　着那老闆，但他終於決定還是和平的買下來，代替復仇的發洩。那英國人回到船上後，吩咐他的管家立即開一瓶威士忌酒拿到他的艙房裏去。</p>
<h3>求知難</h3>
<p>— 周洲</p>
<p>聯大，這個譽滿全國因抗戰而建立於大後方的聯合大學。在勝利後的第一個暑期裏，於上海舉行她的第一次招生，使許多江南的朋友，得到一個升學的機會，這是千萬個學子所　頌的，同時，也可以說是我們國家敎育界的一點進步，這裏，我不想逐條的將她的優點一一指出，我只從部分考生中綜合着他們（或她們）的幾點痛苦，這種痛苦加之在一羣孜孜求學的靑年身上，至少我要要求負責者改善！</p>
<p>報名時間的短促，好多學校差不多同有這樣的情形，就以聯大而論吧！近萬的考生，要在兩天內在同一地點，領取報名號碼，其擁擠情况是可想像而知的，雖有聯大當局善良的措施，然而，不能領取報名號碼因而發生困難的考生不知好多，我親眼看到在交大佈吿牆上「徴求報名號碼」的啓事，想來這總難會不是事實吧！</p>
<p>考生的食宿問題：幾天前交大的露天操塲上，屋簷下，樓板上，都睏滿了好多考生，蚊蟲。螞蟻不斷的襲擊，天氣驟冷驟熱的變化，試想這一羣還沒有健全的靑年人，那裏受得了，何况正當時疫易於流行的今天，雖有交大同學張貼。「病症流行，操塲禁止睡人」的佈吿。然而，你敎他們到那裏去哩！吃，他們很多受着商人的敲詐。一個有考生服務團的交大，已經巷他們盡了不少的義務！然而，距離盡善盡美的地步還遠。</p>
<p>生活難，求知也難，這年頭眞苦人太甚！</p>
<h3>迎新送奮　大官難做小官更難做</h3>
<p>— 復君</p>
<p>做大官不易，做小官尤不易。大官之上，猶有大官；小富之下，更有小官。詔媚逢迎，低聲下氣，眞是大魚吃小魚，小魚吃蝦，蝦吃泥沙，……一層層，一重重，相尅相生，永無已時。</p>
<p>新官來，下屬忐忑不安，戰戰兢兢，唯恐打破飯碗，於是凑公份，你一千，我三千，鷄尾酒會當屬無此能力，盛大的茶會到底熱鬧了一番！那知三五日後，新官帶來的一批「鷄犬」紛紛「成仙」，彼可取而代也，小小的官兒落得一個滾蛋！</p>
<p>舊官走，忙的仍是「嘍囑」，還不是和迎新一樣，又是湊公份，大家分攤，你一千，我三千，仍是茶會招待一番？有的做得像樣些的，還要進一步發動工商界，和那廣大的民衆團體，豎一塊「去思碑」送一把「萬民傘」！那些由鷄犬成仙的小官兒，當然又都作猢猻散了。</p>
<p>迎新送舊，送舊迎新，循環不息，好如走馬燈。官塲多「變」，「變」則「動」，「動」則無有不「倒」的！苦的還不是一些小官！其實更苦的還是老百姓啊！他們今日迎新，明天送舊，忙來忙去，旣無「成仙」之望，當亦無有「猢猻」可做，脂膏供新舊官兒放火，自己非奉令不得點燈！</p>
<h3>為下一代想！</h3>
<p>— 諺默</p>
<p>近日來我眼睛所看見的路旁都有擁滿了的人羣，（兒童和成人）。一條長凳上坐着的兒童們聚精會神地沈醉在他們的幻想中，低着頭，手指不定地翻着。忘却了炎熱的烈日，囂雜的人聲，和這繁華的花花世界，他們的天地中，只有假手槍，眞手槍，越牆走壁的飛俠，喳一聲的法寳。看得他們神往，三兩個頭更加靠得緊了，多麽津津有味，勝過敎室裏的聽講！傍晚的時候，我們的弄堂裏，成羣的兒童們拿着木刀竹竿你一刀，我一槍地做着「設身處地」的表演，把他們的幻想表達於動作上。</p>
<p>兒童最富有幻想，好奇心，也最容易感受。大家該不會忘記的吧，幾年前，十七八歲的靑年，怎樣受了武俠小說，偵探小說的毒而入山求師。怎樣實行他們「刧富濟貧」的理想。這種毒害很容易引誘兒童們的思想走入歧途。多危險呀！兒童好像一張純潔的白紙，可以用彩色配合成美麗的畫面，更可以用汚墨塗成黑紙。我們希望兒童成美麗偉大的畫面，抑或成無用的黑紙？</p>
<p>要滿足兒童們的好奇心，要達到他們的幻想，更須要配備適合的環境，來發展他們的本能，滿足他們的需要，兒童們聖潔的黃金時代中，環境的優劣，就是奠定他們未來的思想，人生觀念，個性，品格，以及行爲的優劣。所以能不能忽視兒童們的環境？</p>
<p>擁在小書攤旁的兒童，實在是要滿是他們精神糧食的需要的一種表現。但是，我們應該注意；所配給的精神糧食是否無害？結果的影響怎樣？我希望在不久的將來，代替街旁的小書攤而是許多的兒童圖書館。培養他們對於文學，藝術，科學的基本趣味。由於好奇才能發生趣味，由趣味才能愛好，由愛好才能深刻地追求，所以目前的兒童們是缺乏精神糧食，而且需要精神糧食！　救救孩子</p>

<h3>Lushan to Host Important Gathering: Zeng Qi Visits Chairman to Present Views on National Affairs; Marshall Has No Intention to Return to the US Recently</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 14th Dispatch] It is learned that Chairman Chiang, in order to broadly solicit opinions on national affairs from all sectors of the country, will invite in batches respected figures from various regions, university presidents, and leaders of provincial public opinion organs, such as provincial assembly speakers, to meet and confer in Kuling. It is also heard that this meeting will not be in the form of a conference, nor will there be a fixed topic for discussion. It is said that everyone can provide valuable opinions on the most pressing issues of politics, economy, culture, education, and society. This discussion will be the largest and most important deliberative gathering before the convening of the pseudo-National Assembly.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 14th Dispatch] Zhu Jiaju is scheduled to fly to Xunyang tomorrow and then proceed to Kuling to make arrangements for the upcoming meeting with university presidents to discuss affairs.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Kuling, 14th Dispatch] Youth Party leader Zeng Qi paid a visit to Chairman Chiang at approximately 5:00 PM today to present the party's views on national affairs.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Kuling, 14th Dispatch] At 5:45 PM this afternoon, Chairman Chiang received Zeng Qi. Zeng expressed his admiration for the Chairman's determination to implement party government ahead of schedule and to promote the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference. He also stated that Lushan was the decision-making place for the War of Resistance nine years ago and expressed hope that today's Lushan would be the birthplace of peace. The meeting lasted about an hour.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 14th Dispatch] After Chairman Chiang's address to the compatriots on the current national affairs was published in the Tianjin newspapers, it was highly valued by Chinese and foreign figures in the capital. They generally believe that in these chaotic times, Chairman Chiang's analysis of the current political and economic situation in the country and his instructions on future policies for handling the situation are sufficient to stabilize the distressed emotions of the people of the whole country. In particular, the three points he put forward – distinguishing right from wrong, upholding justice, understanding etiquette, knowing integrity, knowing responsibility, and abiding by the law – are considered the most basic guidelines for our people's efforts to build the country in the future and are the most important announcement in the year since the victory of the War of Resistance. Reactions from all parties have been enthusiastic in support.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 14th Dispatch] After the publication of Chairman Chiang's statement, Zhou Enlai of the CCP delegation conducted a day-long study. According to a spokesperson for the CCP delegation, the Communist Party believes that the seriousness of this statement is unprecedented in the last ten years. The Communist Party is determined to continue to fight based on the principle of "unconditional ceasefire" and hopes that all national worthies and parties will work together to make a concerted effort. They also hope that the US government will mediate fairly and that the US will change its past practices, such as military aid to China and transportation troops, so that negotiations can proceed smoothly. General opinion believes that the Communist Party's argument is a powerful testament to its defiance and is regrettable.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 14th Dispatch] Marshal Ma had no activities today. After Chairman Chiang's statement, he remained silent and did not express any opinions. Yu Dawei visited Marshal Ma at 6:00 PM this afternoon; the content is unknown. Furthermore, Marshal Ma will soon go to Kuling and ascend Mount Lu for the fourth time.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 13th Dispatch] US Deputy Secretary of State Acheson told reporters today that Marshal Marshall has no intention to return to the US recently. When asked if he had any comment on the joint statement by Marshall and Stuart, Acheson replied, "The statement is already very complete; he will not comment further."</p>
<p>Zeng Qi's Remarks</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Kuling, 14th Dispatch] Zeng Qi issued the following remarks today: During the War of Resistance, I successively published articles such as "Certain Victory in the Anti-Japanese War" and "Psychological Construction of the Long-Term War of Resistance." At that time, some considered them high-sounding. Fortunately, with the leadership of the Supreme Commander and the sacrifices of the military and civilians across the country, they were eventually proven in fact, which I am truly gratified about. Today, I read Chairman Chiang's address to the compatriots and could not help but recall the events of nine years ago when I was invited to attend the Lushan Conference. During the meeting, Chairman Chiang said, "Once the war starts, there must be no compromise halfway. Halfway compromise will inevitably lead to destruction!" His voice and expression were stern at the time. After eight years of bloody battles and countless storms, Chairman Chiang persisted in his beliefs and finally achieved victory. Although I do not entirely agree with Chairman Chiang's political views, I cannot help but admire his firm will. I still remember when Chairman Chiang celebrated his fiftieth birthday, I sent a congratulatory couplet saying, "Returning our rivers and mountains dares to attribute private views to Luo, hoping you will directly join Hu to establish great achievements." After the Xi'an Incident, I sent a telegram to comfort Mr. Chiang, saying, "I hope you will broadly open your doors and extend your reach to the heroes of the four seas, and forever protect the territory, dispel the peeping of the nine barbarians, so that you will not forget being in Ju and can accomplish Huan Gong's achievements to awe, and you can achieve Gou Jian's ambition to overwhelm Wu." Now, most of it has come to fruition, and my joy can be known. As for the statement's call to implement the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference and implement the program for peaceful nation-building, from the standpoint of a representative to the Political Consultative Conference, I express my full sympathy. However, the reform of the entire political system still has some specific issues that need to be further negotiated. This depends on the sincere unity of all parties and society, and the elite in the government and the opposition. Humans often understand each other through contact, while isolation easily leads to misunderstandings. If a framework for democratic establishment can be established within the year, it will surely give a new impression to China and the rest of the world. At the opening and closing of the Political Consultative Conference, I contributed sixteen words to all parties in the government and the opposition: "Be open and honest, draw on collective wisdom, follow the facts, and eliminate corruption." Now, if we want to realize what Chairman Chiang said in his statement, we must not deviate from this. Furthermore, Chairman Chiang emphasized that political disputes should be resolved politically, which coincides with our long-held view that "political disputes should be resolved in the arena, not on the battlefield." Confucius praised Guan Zhong's talent, saying, "Guan Zhong united the lords nine times and rectified the world without military vehicles, which is benevolent." Having military force but not using it lightly is the highest quality of a politician. When Chairman Chiang pacified Guangdong without attacking Guangxi in 1936, I knew that he had shifted from a military solution to a political solution. Later, he relied on this to create a united national front against Japan. Therefore, political solutions have long been an effective method, and I hope that all future issues can be resolved politically and that the military will be used externally, and the country will become increasingly prosperous. I believe that all people across the country must share the same feeling.</p>
<p>Zuo Shunsheng's Remarks</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Yesterday, a reporter visited Youth Party leader Zuo Shunsheng at the party headquarters on Huashan Road in this city to inquire about the party's views on the statement issued by the Chairman. He informed us that Chairman Chiang expressed his willingness to abide by the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference and the troop reorganization plan to resolve all current problems, which is very important. The Youth Party hopes that the nationalization of the military and the democratization of politics can proceed simultaneously and be fully realized in the shortest possible time. As for the Youth Party's intention to convene the Lushan Conference, it is because, at a time when Marshal Ma's mediation and direct negotiations between the KMT and the CCP are difficult, the only way is to appeal to the broad people. This intermediate conference, between the Political Consultative Conference and the National Assembly, if used properly, would be beneficial and consistent with the KMT and the CCP's respect for the people. The reporter inquired about the CCP's proposal to include the China problem in the joint mediation of the UK and the Soviet Union. However, there are already many contradictions between the UK and the US and the Soviet Union on other issues. Adding a complex China problem would not only be unhelpful but also harmful. The Youth Party completely opposes this. Zuo then mentioned the "Youth Party Declaration" issued by Zhou Jidao and others in Nanjing, saying that there was indeed a Zhou Jidao in the Youth Party in the past, but he was expelled from the party long ago for his anti-party behavior during the War of Resistance. His fraudulent activities may have other purposes and are not worth laughing at. The Youth Party stated that it currently has more than 500,000 party members.</p>
<h3>Lushan Summer Academic Lectures: Chairman Instructs for Annual Organization; Reception for Lecturers Held at Headquarters Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Kuling, 14th Dispatch] Chairman Chiang convened a tea party for the lecturers of the Lushan Summer Academic Lectures at his headquarters at 4:30 PM on the 14th. More than 20 people, including Cheng Shijun, Chen Heqin, and Zhou Bangdao, attended. Committee Member Chen Bulei, Director Wu Wenguan, and Education Director Jiang Jingguo accompanied him. During the event, the Chairman first stated, "I originally intended to attend the lectures every week and give a speech to all the students, but I am too busy with work to spare the time, so I left the mountain before the end of the course, which is a deep regret." The Chairman then inquired about the internal organization of the lectures, teaching principles, and student performance in detail, which Lecturer Cheng Shijun answered one by one. The Chairman highly praised the organization of the lectures, believing that being able to use spare time to allow students to exercise their bodies and minds and strive to improve themselves is a win-win situation and hopes that they can be held every year. The Chairman also inquired about the location of Zhongzheng University, believing that if the school could be moved near Lushan, with the pleasant scenery and climate of Lushan and the greatness of its historical significance, it would surely cultivate many talents in the future and strive to build the country. At this point, the Chairman asked each lecturer about their work situation and encouraged them to promote academics and reform the atmosphere as their own responsibility. The lecturers were very moved by the Chairman's instructions. The gathering dispersed at 5:30 PM.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] Chen Lifu attended the Lushan Summer Academic Lectures at 4:30 PM on the 14th and gave a lecture on "The Purpose of Chinese Education."</p>
<h3>Ministry of Economic Affairs Adds Department of Foreign Trade</h3>
<p>Wang Yunwu to Go to Lushan Today</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 14th Dispatch] It is learned that the Ministry of Economic Affairs, in order to promote foreign trade and strengthen management, has decided to add a Department of Foreign Trade within the ministry. Past institutions such as the Trade Commission will be placed under the jurisdiction of this department. Part of the responsibilities of the Ministry's Control Department and Commercial Department will be managed by the newly established Department of Foreign Trade. The original Enterprise Department will be abolished. However, the organization, the date of initial establishment, and the personnel of the department have not yet been determined. Furthermore, Minister of Economic Affairs Wang Yunwu was originally scheduled to fly to Lu today to report to the Chairman, but due to the flooding of the Jiujiang Airport, he will not be able to depart until tomorrow.</p>
<h3>Press Reception for Foreign Correspondents: Minister Peng Reports</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 14th Dispatch] The press reception for foreign correspondents organized by the Ministry of Information was held at 4:30 PM on the 14th, presided over by Minister Peng Xuepei and Vice Minister Liu Jizhi. Minister Peng gave a general report on the sudden conflicts in various places in northern Jiangsu. The following is the original text of the Q&amp;A: (Q) How is the war situation in northern Jiangsu and other places? (Minister Peng A) The conflict in northern Jiangsu started on July 13, which was also the day the CCP launched a full-scale attack. The Communist army attacked Taiyu with sixteen regiments, and when the government army counterattacked, the Communist army immediately retreated. By the end of July, the Yangtai Highway had been controlled by the National Army. The area west of Yangzhou originally had about 50,000 Communist troops, who have now been driven north of Gaoyou and Hongze Lakes. Further west, the Communist army is besieging Sixian. In the area from Xuzhou to Kaifeng, there is the Liu Bocheng unit of the Communist army, which has moved south in a large-scale from the Taihang Mountains. At the end of July, they arrived in Heze, Shandong, and on August 8, they attacked the Longhai Railway with 27 regiments and are currently attacking Kaifeng fiercely. In Shanxi, the CCP's attempt is to occupy the entire province of Shanxi. This is the most obvious touchstone to prove who is the attacker. If Datong is occupied by the Communist army, there will be no room for dispute as to who launched the conflict, because there are very few government troops near Datong, and there is no reason to attack the Communist army. Zhangjiakou has now become the CCP's general base for mobilizing military affairs in the Shanxi area, which is more important militarily than Yan'an. Large-scale organization of training troops and manufacturing weapons are underway there.</p>

<h3>Jiangnan Public Security Conference to be Held in Suzhou Tomorrow; Curfew Implemented in Wuxi Starting Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 14th Dispatch] The Communist army has been secretly infiltrating various counties in Jiangnan, plotting activities. Therefore, the public security in Nanjing, Shanghai, and other parts of Jiangnan is becoming increasingly important. General Tang Enbo, Commander-in-Chief of the Nanjing-Shanghai Garrison, has specifically scheduled a conference to be held in Suzhou on the 16th to discuss measures to maintain public security. Tang will personally preside over the conference.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Wuxi, 14th Dispatch] Starting at 12:00 AM on the 14th, passage is prohibited in the urban area. Self-defense groups in various towns have been ordered to make visits.</p>
<h3>Robertson and Ye Jianying Arrive in Beijing: Agreement Reached on Investigation Procedures for the Anping Incident</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Beiping, 14th Dispatch] The fate of the Beiping Military Mediation Office will be decided by Robertson, the US representative to the Military Mediation Office, and Marshall's special envoy at an emergency meeting in Nanjing. Robertson took a special plane to Beijing at 1:00 PM on the 14th, accompanied by Communist Party representative Ye Jianying. This indicates that the Communist Party's attitude will be one of the key issues in the meeting between the Special Envoy Ma and Robertson.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 14th Dispatch] Military Mediation Office representatives Robertson (US) and Ye Jianying (Communist) flew to Beijing in the afternoon of the 14th to report the Anping Incident to Marshal Ma and Zhou Enlai. Ye Jianying's aide Zhang Ziyu accompanied them. Prior to flying to Beijing, the Executive Headquarters Tripartite Committee completed an agreement on the investigation procedures for the Group of 25. If there are no other complications, the group is expected to depart soon to investigate. The main points of the investigation procedure are as follows: (1) Inquire and record the factual reports witnessed by Major Chuan Ruizhi and Diuke Jun, who are Executive Headquarters personnel who came to Beiping in US military patrol vehicles on the 29th of last month. (2) Inquire and record Lieutenant Colonel Belcher, commander of the US Marine Corps, and US Marine Corps personnel involved in the conflict. (3) Visit, inquire, and record the testimony of Communist army commanders and soldiers involved in the conflict (passports will be issued by the government and the Communist Party, and vehicles will be provided by the US). (4) Inspect the conflict area and visit and record the testimony of other witnesses. (5) Inquire and record the testimony of Major General Locke, commander of the 1st Marine Division of the US Marine Corps currently in Tianjin, General Sun Lianzhong, current commander of the 11th War Zone, and senior Communist army commanders in the area where the incident occurred. (6) Visit and record the testimony of some other witnesses, who are considered necessary to consult by each party. (7) Visit, inquire, and record whether the National Army troops that the Communist Party claims participated in the conflict but that the government and Major General Locke deny participated in the conflict are true. (8) Convene a group meeting and report to the Tripartite Committee. In addition, it was agreed that the tripartite representatives of the Group of 25 would take turns chairing the meeting.</p>
<h3>Du Yuming Returns to Liaoning</h3>
<p>Satisfied with Six-Day Inspection</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Jiyang, 13th Dispatch] Director Du Yuming inspected Fushun, Yingkou, Dashiqiao, and other places for six days and returned on the 13th. According to reporters, the main purpose of this trip was to understand the education of the troops stationed in various places. The results of the inspection were generally satisfactory, and improvements have been instructed where necessary. The defenses of various places can be said to be solid.

Several other cases have also been discovered and are under investigation.</p>

<h3>National Army Reinforcements for Kaifeng Turn the Situation Around; Communist Army in Northern Jiangsu Attacks Libao; Fierce Fighting Underway Near Hai'an Town</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 14th Dispatch] According to reliable sources, the strength of the Communist army in the Henan-Shandong border area that has infiltrated near Kaifeng is about six regiments or more. Passenger transport on the Bianxu section of the Longhai Railway has been completely suspended. The National Army's powerful units reinforcing Kaifeng from the west of the Longhai Railway and the south of the Pinghan Railway have arrived near Kaifeng and are strengthening the defenses between Bianzheng and Bianxin (Xinxiang). Although the situation is tense, because a senior commander of the National Army has arrived in the provincial capital by plane from Xi'an, morale has turned around.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Jiangdu, 14th Dispatch] Fierce fighting has broken out again on the right wing of northern Jiangsu. The Communist army in Dongtai attacked Libao Town from the 11th with a force of eight regiments, but failed. They then increased their strength to more than ten regiments and attacked fiercely. Yesterday, a telegram from Taixian reported that the situation in Libao Town was unclear, and fighting was underway near Hai'an Town. There have been no changes on the left wing of northern Jiangsu.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Jiangdu, 14th Dispatch] Military news: Zhang Dingcheng, commander of the Central China Military Region of the Communist army, asked Zhu De for instructions by telegram due to military setbacks.

The Feibu unit of the 1st Division of the New Fourth Army, which is gathered in Linbian, is also heading south. The Communist army in other places is moving frequently every day, but they are all small units. Only the small units of the Communist army on the Jiji line and the Zhangbo branch line are constantly attacking the National Army. Their main forces are the 4th and 9th Liberation Divisions, and the rest are militia. The Communist army's strength in Shandong is currently about 300,000 people or less, and the National Army's self-defense force is sufficient to maintain the government's strongholds.</p>

<h3>Communist Army Rushing to Demolish the Chinese Changchun Railway; Using Locomotives to Pull Up Rails; Sound is Miserable; Passengers Witnessing Are Heartbroken and Cannot Bear to See</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Panyang, 13th Dispatch] A visitor from Harbin said: Trains leaving Harbin have now been shortened by one station, stopping at Sanchakou Hebei Caijia Man. When passing through Sanchakou, he saw the Communist army using locomotives to pull up the rails, and the rail sleepers were lifted along with them. The sound of demolition was miserable. A military officer sat in the car, supervising dozens of people, going up and down, hammering the rails that could not be pulled up. There were also several carriages carrying the Communist army protecting the demolition. Most people could not bear to see this heartbreaking destruction. This train demolishing the railway is proceeding from Sanchakou along the western section of the line to the bank of the First Songhua River. It is heard that the Communist army will also destroy the eastern section of the line. If this is the case, the conversion of rails between Sanchakou and the riverbank will be in vain.</p>
<h3>Situ Leideng Handling School Affairs, Seemingly Observing Our Country's Situation</h3>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 14th] According to reports from foreign correspondents here, Stuart Leideng is not as optimistic about the current situation as he was in yesterday's conversation with Chinese reporters. The Ambassador admitted to the United Press's Parker and other foreign correspondents that prior to the Marshall-Stuart joint statement, peace negotiations had reached an almost impossible point. As of today, this dire situation has not changed in any way. Although Stuart's return to Beiping is ostensibly to handle school affairs, it also carries a somewhat observational nature. If the situation deteriorates in his view, it is difficult to say whether Stuart will return to Nanjing to continue as Ambassador. After all, he is a "consummate good guy" and educator, and cannot bear the torment of a chaotic situation. Several foreign correspondents here are concerned that the Military Mediation Department will soon close its doors, and believe that Robertson's trip to Nanjing may not only fail to report the Anping incident, but may even provide reference materials, awaiting Marshall's decision on the issue of the Military Mediation Department's continued existence under these circumstances.</p>
<p>A Clever Metaphor</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 14th] Today, the reporter visited a qualified individual who, based on his observations and experiences, pointed out several aspects of Marshall and Stuart Leideng's past efforts from a side perspective: (1) The obstruction of Marshall and Stuart's efforts was indeed due to the inability of the Kuomintang and the Communist Party to approach each other. However, one side's attitude of wanting to solve the problem while using not solving it as a method made the two elders, unaccustomed to this approach, feel helpless. Moreover, every time they discussed a problem, the other side would launch a roundabout, indirect attack, which the Americans were also unaccustomed to. Using a soccer game as a metaphor, the two elders were no longer referees, but had become the ball being kicked back and forth. Although the joint statement was not the sound of a ball bursting, it was at least an impatient explanation. (2) Regarding the Anping incident, Marshall visited Stuart early in the morning after receiving the report, expressing, "This matter is very serious." Marshall and Stuart believed that, regardless of whether the incident's background was planned or merely a local action, it was undoubtedly a serious fact. At the same time, it gave a major shock to the general Americans. Later, Stuart received a telegram from someone in the country stating that if this was a planned action by the Communist Party, it would be a major mistake by the Communist Party. Others even stated, "When Japan attacked Pearl Harbor, they did not know the consequences they would suffer later." Although this incident was not as serious as that, it could serve as a warning. (3) What the future holds depends entirely on whether the parties involved have the sincerity and determination to change their past practices.</p>

<h3>National Police Agency Established Today, Comprising Six Sections According to Organizational Regulations, Director Tang Zong Discusses Key Principles of Police Development</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Nanjing Dispatch, 14th] The Ministry of Interior's National Police Agency is officially established on the 15th. The reporter interviewed Director Tang Zong on the 14th, who explained the agency's mission as follows: Resistance and nation-building are established policies of our party. With the victory in the War of Resistance, external threats have been eliminated. Both Chinese and foreigners look forward to our country establishing a democratic and unified nation of peace and order, thus administering politics in an orderly manner. Therefore, the Second Plenary Session of the Central Committee this year and previous National Political Participation Conferences have discussed police development. Especially with the imminent convening of the National Assembly and the implementation of constitutional government, a sound police force and a unified administrative structure are necessary to promote central government policies and strictly enforce national rule of law. National construction is a complex endeavor, with economic construction, political construction, and military construction being interrelated. The construction of a modern police force contributes to the implementation of various constructions, including economic, political, and military aspects. Therefore, police development is a pressing need for the country. The establishment of the National Police Agency is a timely response to this need. The director has been ordered to oversee this work, with a heavy responsibility. However, only by recruiting talents from all sides, being loyal and responsible, not wasting a single person or a single penny, and doing his best, can he fulfill the purpose of building the police. As for the current task, it is to establish a modern police system for the country, and to safeguard social security and order based on democratic principles, laying the foundation for the peaceful unification of the country under the rule of law. It is hoped that people at home will voice their opinions to promote its success. After the Director's speech, he also showed the agency's organizational regulations, which revealed that the agency is divided into six sections: the First Section is responsible for administrative police and various specialized police matters; the Second Section is responsible for police education; the Third Section is responsible for security police; the Fourth Section is responsible for criminal police; the Fifth Section is responsible for foreign affairs police; and the Sixth Section is responsible for general affairs.</p>
<h3>Shenyang Turns Autumnal After a Rain</h3>
<p>[Our Pan Yang Dispatch, 13th] Shenyang has experienced continuous rainy days, and the thermometer has dropped from 89 degrees to 74 degrees, a difference of 15 degrees, creating a sense of autumn coolness after a rain. It is necessary to wear a jacket.</p>
<h3>Execution of Traitor Chu is Imminent, Original Text of Rejection of Re-Trial Request Published</h3>
<p>[Our Suzhou Dispatch, 14th] The case of Chu Minyi's request for a retrial has been previously decided by the Supreme Court to reject the request for a retrial, details of which have been reported in this newspaper. It is now known that the original text of the ruling was delivered to Suzhou from Nanjing on the 13th, and the local High Court released it to reporters on the 14th. The key points are summarized as follows: (1) The requirement for requesting a retrial is that important evidence sufficient to affect the judgment has been omitted from consideration, resulting in a significant error. This refers to the establishment of criminal facts recognized by the original confirmed judgment, or facts related to the severity of the crime, as well as dismissal of charges or mandatory exemption or reduction of punishment. Significant errors, once retried, should be subject to acquittal, dismissal, exemption, reduction of punishment, or a judgment lighter than the crime originally recognized. The issue of sentencing discretion in the trial is not included. Therefore, the party cannot specifically criticize the sentencing of the original confirmed judgment as a reason for requesting a retrial. (2) The applicant, Chu Chen Jingzhen, claimed that the defendant retrieved the Father of the Nation's manuscript and preserved the Father of the Nation's relics. Even if this was not considered by the original judgment or was newly discovered evidence, it would not significantly affect the establishment of the defendant's crime of conspiring with an enemy country or conspiring to resist this country. The defendant cannot therefore receive the benefit of acquittal, dismissal, exemption, or a judgment lighter than the crime originally recognized. (3) The defendant's previous actions, according to the provisions of the Regulations on Handling Traitor Cases, which stipulate the reduction of punishment, are "may be reduced," not "must be reduced." This is still a matter of criminal sentencing, which belongs to the court's discretion. It is not a reason for the party to request a retrial. The original initial court did not conduct thorough research and hastily ruled to start the retrial, which is not in accordance with the law and should be revoked. The reporter stationed in Suzhou interviewed a spokesperson for the Suzhou High Court on the issue of Chu's execution. The spokesperson stated: The execution order has not yet been issued, and it is expected that Chu's wife must resubmit a request for a retrial before he can be executed.</p>
<h3>Organizing the Jinhua River Water Conservancy Project, Zhejiang Provincial Government Decides on Methods, Establishes Engineering Agency, Construction to Begin This Year</h3>
<p>[Our Hangzhou Dispatch, 14th] In order to organize the Jinhua River water conservancy project, the Zhejiang Provincial Government invited people from the river basin in the province, as well as responsible personnel from relevant agencies, to hold a discussion meeting at the Provincial Government on the 13th, presided over by Chairman Shen himself. The following methods were decided upon. First, an engineering agency was established: (A) The special commissioner of the Fourth District will convene local people from nine counties related to the Jinhua River, including Dongyang, Yiwu, Puan, Yongkang, Wuyi, Xuanping, Jinhua, Tangxi, and Lanxi, to organize the Jinhua River Water Conservancy Council, responsible for raising, keeping, and paying for water conservancy project funds, and discussing project plans and budgets. (B) The Jinhua River Water Conservancy Engineering Office will be organized to manage the project. There will be one director, concurrently held by the special commissioner, one deputy director, and one chief engineer, one engineer, and one assistant engineer, all of whom will be dispatched by the Water Conservancy Bureau. Other personnel will be transferred from the special commissioner's office. (C) One engineering office will be established in each of the five counties of Dongyang, Yiwu, Lanxi, Wukang, and Tangxi to carry out construction. Engineers, assistant engineers, and project personnel will be dispatched by the Engineering Office, and administrative personnel will be transferred from the county government offices, with the principle of not increasing personnel expenses. Second, regarding the types of construction and funding, it was agreed to divide them into two types: flood control projects and farmland water conservancy projects. The estimated total cost of the project is 253,300 ordinary technicians and 46,900 workers. The wage portion requires approximately 605 shi of flour (worth over 300 million yuan), which will be requested from the Zhejiang-Fujian Branch Office. The remaining expenses are estimated at 144.25 million yuan. 24 million yuan will be allocated by the provincial government for project management fees, and the remainder will be collected from the beneficiaries of the farmland project and submitted to the province for allocation of stored grain or borrowing from banks. The first phase of the farmland water conservancy project involves the dredging and excavation of ditches in the Jinhua Lake Haitang, which can store water to irrigate 13,000 mu of land and generate 470 horsepower of hydroelectric power to supply regional lighting and industrial power. The estimated cost is 420 million yuan, and the Water Conservancy Bureau will send personnel to quickly survey and design it, with construction scheduled to begin this year.</p>

<h3>Securing Teng Li with Blood and Sweat</h3>
<p>One year ago today, after three days of hesitation, the Japanese government finally accepted the Potsdam Declaration. Emperor Hirohito broadcast to the entire nation, formally announcing Japan's unconditional surrender to the Allies. Thus, the most glorious page in human history was turned. The Allied nations had fought arduously for eight years to achieve this final victory. On that day last year, people around the world celebrated, and the Chinese people wept with joy. Consequently, August 15th, a day of great victory, was permanently recorded in human history for us and our descendants to commemorate annually.</p>
<p>However, one year later today, as we encounter this great anniversary of victory, we should be welcoming this epoch-making day with the most excited emotions and the most joyful hearts. Yet, observing the objective environment around us, whether it is the domestic political situation or the global landscape, does not allow us to be overly optimistic. Remembering the various hardships of the past and looking towards the future, a myriad of emotions arises, leaving us speechless, with a mixture of sweet, sour, bitter, and spicy tastes in our hearts.</p>
<p>Recalling this day a year ago, our country fought hard without any support, relying solely on the blood and sweat of our 400 million people to persevere. After eight long years, just as we were exhausted, the enemy's invading forces finally collapsed before us. This hard-earned victory was truly invaluable, and it's no wonder our people wept with joy. This joy was the most sublime emotion, born from the "bitter turning to sweet" experience. At the same time, in the immediate aftermath of the war, people held beautiful ideals for China's future, unanimously believing that a China emerging from war would surely step into a new era of peace, unity, democracy, and strength, becoming a true great power, one of the four or five strongest nations. Even after a year, looking back today, it feels like a sweet memory.</p>
<p>The people's passionate enthusiasm and beautiful ideals at that time have been shattered by the realities of the past year, leaving everyone feeling disappointed and saddened. In this past year, due to the existence of the Communist Party problem, we missed a golden opportunity that comes once in a millennium, causing us immense heartache and regret. Domestically, we face perilous situations, which not only prevent the suffering people from recuperating after the war but also exacerbate their hardship due to stagnant production and endless inflation. Looking ahead, if the Communist Party problem remains unresolved, there is little hope for improvement in the people's lives in the near future. Therefore, on this great anniversary, thinking of our 400 million people suffering in dire straits, how can we remain unmoved and not feel heartache? At the same time, our country, having made unparalleled contributions to the victory, could have been one of the four or five great powers. However, due to domestic turmoil, we not only failed to gain the respect and importance of other countries but were also often subjected to international ridicule and misunderstanding. In December of last year, the foreign ministers of the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union even declared non-interference in China's internal affairs, causing China's international standing to plummet. How can the internal affairs of a dignified great power be subject to foreign intervention! Why did the three foreign ministers need to issue such a statement! Therefore, the Moscow Declaration was clearly an insult to China, or at least a form of ridicule. The Chinese people could have used this stimulus to rise up, rely on their own efforts, and focus on national reconstruction. However, we are still constrained by the realities of the environment, especially the Communist Party, which fundamentally opposes China's unification and hopes to provoke international intervention, turning China into a second Spain. When the four foreign ministers met in Paris, China was even insulted by Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov, who opposed inviting China to the Paris Peace Conference. Only after the United States argued reasonably was China able to remain as one of the presidium members of the Paris Peace Conference, taking turns chairing with the United Kingdom, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union. Recently, the Chinese Communist Party, indulging in fanciful ideas, alternately proposed that the China problem be handled by the United Nations Security Council and demanded that the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union hold equal status with the United States in the Chinese peace negotiations. Their intention is nothing more than to lower China's international status, reducing it to a third or fourth-rate small country, or even turning China into a semi-colony, worse than a small country. As we commemorate Victory Day, thinking of this self-degrading situation, how can we not feel a burning sense of shame?</p>
<p>Amidst tasting the sweetness, sourness, bitterness, and spiciness, one noble emotion arises spontaneously. This is because the greatness and strength of the Chinese nation make us deeply believe in its bright and promising future. During the Anti-Japanese War, our country had virtually no support. We relied solely on our nation's thousands of years of culture, the power of international justice, and the authority of human conscience. But eventually, we reached this day last year and achieved final victory. Similarly, during this period of national reconstruction, although the Communist Party is hindering us, making the "difficulties of post-war recovery or construction even greater than during the war," we will never be pessimistic or discouraged. We should still use our nation's wisdom and international justice to eliminate all obstacles in the path of national reconstruction. As we commemorate Victory Day, the entire nation should make a firm resolution to preserve the "flower of victory" obtained through the blood and sweat of millions at any cost, and allow it to bear fruit. This flower of victory was cultivated with the blood and sweat of millions. From now on, we must shed more blood and sweat to irrigate this glorious flower, so that the blood and sweat shed in the past will not have been shed in vain.</p>

<h3>Wuxi and Wujin decide on grain borrowing measures amid rain</h3>
<p>[Our Wuxi correspondent] The county government has been ordered to prepare 30,000 shi of land tax, which will be allocated by district, with a ratio of 3:7. 70% will be borne by the rural districts, and 30% by the urban districts. Loans will be sought from grain merchants, grain households, and various entities. Qian Zai, Chairman of the Chamber of Commerce, considering the importance of this matter, specially convened an emergency meeting of representatives from various industries and community leaders at 4:00 PM on the 12th to assist in borrowing grain. The following resolutions were made: (1) The county government will establish a grain borrowing committee; (2) For the rural townships, one month's rent from shops and houses will be borrowed, with the landlord responsible; (3) The required grain should be purchased from production areas outside the county; (4) Grain merchants will contribute 4,500 shi, and various industries will contribute 4,500 shi (including 1,000 shi from grain households). It is reported that the rural districts have stipulated that 3 sheng of rice will be borrowed per mu. [Our Changzhou correspondent] The Wujin County government convened the first pre-borrowing of land tax meeting with major grain households in the county at 3:00 PM on the 11th. More than 20 representatives from grain households, including Wu Junchen, Wang Linfu, and monks from Tianning Temple and Qingliang Temple, attended. County Magistrate Sun Danzhen presided over the meeting, which resolved the following key points: (1) Grain households with more than 3 mu will lend 2 sheng per mu, and those with more than 30 mu will lend 5 sheng per mu, all in the form of brown rice; (2) All major grain households must deliver the grain directly to the county warehouse by the 15th of this month, without delay; (3) The county government will issue receipts to offset future tax obligations.</p>
<h3>Jiangsu Provincial Federation of Commerce asks for exemption from profit tax</h3>
<p>[Our Zhenjiang correspondent] The Jiangsu Provincial Federation of Commerce submitted a petition to the relevant central ministries and departments on the 11th, requesting permission to exempt the 1945 business profit tax to alleviate the difficulties of merchants. The original petition stated: "Considering the current situation of merchants in Jiangsu Province, not to mention the situation north of the Yangtze River, the merchants south of the Yangtze River used to rely on the convenience of sales in northern Jiangsu. However, now traffic is obstructed, making activity impossible. Existing inventory cannot be converted into cash, and heavy interest must be paid. Daily expenses are also high due to high prices and multiple taxes. Even if there were slight profits in 1945, they have now been depleted, resulting in debt. If the deadline to pay profit taxes is imposed, bankruptcy will be inevitable. If all merchants go bankrupt and taxes cannot be collected, what kind of market will result? Only by requesting exemption can commercial recovery be hoped for."</p>
<h3>Ministry of Communications dispatches personnel to repair the Xuzhou-Jingning and Xuzhou-Haizhou sections of the railway</h3>
<p>[Our Xuzhou correspondent] The repair projects for the Xuzhou-Yanzhou section of the Jinpu Railway and the Xuzhou-Haizhou section of the Longhai Railway, formerly under the Xuzhou district of the Ministry of Communications, are now the responsibility of Shen Wensi, Deputy Director of the Jinpu Railway Bureau. As the refugee return teams are working with the National Army to gradually recover the Communist areas, the railway repair project must be actively carried out without delay. To increase work efficiency, the Ministry of Communications has dispatched separate personnel to manage the repair projects for the two sections. Shen Wensi will continue to serve concurrently as the director of the Xuzhou-Yanzhou engineering office, while Wu Shien, Deputy Director of the Longhai Railway Bureau, will serve concurrently as the director of the Xuzhou-Haizhou engineering office. Both directors will be directly supervised by the Ministry of Communications. It is reported that both Directors Shen and Wu will arrive in Xuzhou within days.</p>

<h3>The Situation in Iran Suddenly Becomes Serious: The Soviet Union Deploys Troops on the Northern Border of Iran in Response to the Entry of British Troops into Basra</h3>
<p>(Reported by this newspaper) London, 14th Dispatch: The Iranian-Soviet dispute recently brought before the United Nations Security Council has been rekindled by the entry of British troops into Basra. According to the Iranian Ambassador to the United States, he told reporters: "I have just received a report that since British troops entered Basra, Soviet troops have been concentrating on the Azerbaijan border, and the situation is very serious." The British authorities have stated that they will send troops to Iran if necessary to prevent further riots. This has aroused protests from Iran and accusations from the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>(Reported by this newspaper) London, 14th Dispatch: Senior British government officials stated today that Britain will formally reject Iran's claim that British troops have entered Basra, which is bound to have a serious impact on British-Iranian relations. The British note rejecting Iran's protest is said to have been delivered to the British Embassy in Tehran, and will be submitted to the Iranian government after the embassy considers it. Unofficial sources predict that this action by the British government may prompt Iranian Prime Minister Sadanat to bring the case before the United Nations General Assembly or the Security Council.</p>
<p>(Agence France-Presse, Washington, 14th Dispatch) Acting Secretary of State Acheson has just received a report from the Iranian Ambassador to the United States, Hussein Ella, stating that Soviet troops are currently concentrating along the northern border of Iran to counter the British troops stationed in the Iraqi port of Basra (near the southern border of Iran).</p>
<h3>The Soviet Union Demands Control of the Straits: The United Kingdom and the United States Firmly Oppose It; Turkey Acknowledges the Seriousness of the Situation</h3>
<p>(Reported by this newspaper) London, 14th Dispatch: According to well-informed sources, Britain will strongly oppose the Soviet Union's proposal for a "joint Soviet-Turkish defense" of the Dardanelles Strait. Sources here unanimously satirize that the Soviet Union's move is obviously intended to gain control of the Straits. It is reported that the Soviet Union has notified Turkey, advocating for the revision of the Montreux Convention. The United Kingdom and the United States reached an agreement on revising the convention at the Potsdam Conference. If the revision is implemented, the United States will represent Japan as a signatory country to the convention. London officials expect an international conference to be convened to discuss the matter. It is also said that the Soviet Union intends to consult with Turkey alone to resolve this issue, or to hold a meeting of Black Sea countries to resolve it. Turkey's sovereignty over the Dardanelles Strait area has always been under significant pressure from the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>(Associated Press, Washington, 14th Dispatch) As of today's developments, the United States is expected to firmly oppose the Soviet Union's plan to change the jurisdiction of the Dardanelles Strait. The United States will insist on the policy set by Secretary of State Byrnes in November of last year, prohibiting the Soviet Union from establishing bases on Turkish territory near this strait.</p>
<p>(Agence France-Presse, Istanbul, Turkey, 14th Dispatch) The Soviet Union has submitted a memorandum to Turkey, demanding the revision of the Montreux Convention. It is expected that Turkey's response will be delivered to the Soviet Chargé d'Affaires in Turkey today.</p>
<p>(Reuters, Ankara, 13th Dispatch) Regarding the Dardanelles Strait issue, Turkey has rejected the principles proposed by the Soviet Union, stating that due to the signing of the Montreux Convention, this is an international issue.</p>
<p>(Reuters, London, 13th Dispatch) Observers here expect the most serious diplomatic conflict since the end of the war to occur due to the Soviet Union's note to Turkey demanding the revision of the Montreux Convention. The fifth principle of the Soviet note to Turkey concerns the defense of the Straits. The Soviet Union wants to jointly defend this important waterway with Turkey, which is equivalent to demanding a military base in Turkey. It is expected that the Turkish government will strongly resist this. The Soviet note does not seem to suggest convening an international conference, but there is no doubt that this issue will affect the Paris Peace Conference.</p>
<p>(Agence France-Presse, Istanbul, 13th Dispatch) Regarding the Soviet Union's demands concerning the Dardanelles Strait, Turkish political figures unanimously believe that they are unacceptable. Turkish newspapers unanimously believe that the situation is serious and insist that Turkey cannot allow the Soviet Union to participate in the defense of the Straits.</p>
<p>Stalin's Gambit</p>
<h3>Fifth Column Activity Threatens Peace: Hoover Issues Warning</h3>
<p>(Associated Press, Salt Lake City, 12th Dispatch) Former President Hoover, who recently returned from investigating famine areas in various countries around the world, stated here today that Soviet fifth columnists are brewing chaos around the world to enable the Soviet Union to consolidate its position. Currently, apart from the Soviet Union, all countries in the world hope for peace. From his personal impression, the Soviet Union is obstructing this in order to buy time to eliminate all non-Communist elements, so as to consolidate and absorb the areas behind its "Iron Curtain" and in northeastern China. This attempt will one day cause another global explosion. The United States should maintain its atomic bombs until all countries can truly cooperate to seek lasting peace.</p>
<h3>Three Countries Approved to Join the United Nations</h3>
<p>France Vigorously Opposes Relocation to the Meeting</p>
<p>(Associated Press, New York, 13th Dispatch) The United Nations Membership Credentials Committee held a closed meeting today, and the preliminary review of the nine countries applying for membership has been completed. However, Albania and Outer Mongolia still need to answer the questions raised. Sweden and Iceland have been temporarily approved for membership, but the membership of Portugal and Thailand faces strong opposition. Poland was the first to oppose Portugal's membership, while France most fiercely opposed Thailand's membership. The Soviet Union has also expressed opposition to the membership of both Portugal and Thailand. The Mexican representative also stated that the issue of Portugal's membership should be strictly reviewed. The Soviet Union has reserved the right to speak later on the approval of Sweden and Iceland's membership. Polish representative Michalowski accused the Portuguese government of being closely related in ideology to the Spanish Franco government and the former governments of Germany and Italy, and of harboring war criminals within its borders. French representative Ross pointed out that Thailand invaded Vietnam in 1941, and France and Thailand are still at war. Soviet representative Krasinikov stated that his country has no diplomatic relations with Thailand. The United States, the United Kingdom, and most small countries support the approval of all applicant countries reviewed today. Previously, Afghanistan had been approved for membership.</p>
<h3>Rockets Over Sweden: The United States Very Interested</h3>
<p>(United States Information Service, Washington, 13th Dispatch) When asked by reporters for his opinion on the rumors of mysterious rockets being discovered over Sweden, Acting Secretary of State Acheson said that he was very interested in this news and that Sweden was likely very interested in this matter as well and would be looking for traces of these rockets. He also said that the United States had not requested the Swedish government to provide information on this matter.</p>
<h3>A Glimpse of Nuremberg: Goering's Calm Demeanor, Considered a Tough Guy, by an Associated Press Correspondent</h3>
<p>I recently returned from a trip to Europe, and nine out of ten people I met were curious to ask me about the Nuremberg military tribunal's trial of Nazi war criminals. "What is the scene in the courtroom like?" "How is Goering doing now?" Here, I will write down some courtroom anecdotes.</p>
<p>The war criminals sat in the defendant's dock, squeezed together, unable to turn around, which made them very hostile to each other. One day, Jodl, the well-dressed, dignified Prussian general, stood up and protested loudly, saying that he should not be made to sit with this bunch of despicable people.</p>
<p>Only Goering seemed the most at ease. This former showman, who loved to flaunt his medals, is still the darling of the court. He knows that he will be sentenced to hang, but he never loses heart. In any case, Goering can still be considered a tough guy.</p>
<p>Goering sits in the first seat in the defendant's dock. As you enter the courtroom through the side door, you see the defendant's dock on the left, in two rows parallel to each other. In front of them are long tables where the German defense lawyers sit. At the far end of the courtroom are the recorders and court clerks. Behind them, on the stage, at a height above everyone's head, is the judges' bench. There are eight judges in total, two each from the United States, the United Kingdom, France, and the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>The prosecutors sit below, at widely spaced tables. Behind them are comfortable theater-style seats where onlookers can sit and watch the trial, as if watching beasts in a zoo, but even more comfortably. Behind the defendant and the judges' seats are the translators, the witness stand, and the screen for showing evidence.</p>
<p>The films often show the heinous atrocities committed by these Nazi war criminals in the past, such as the gas chambers in the Pilsen concentration camp and the slaughterhouse in Dachau. Some of these criminals closed their eyes, while others looked away, talking about other things.</p>
<p>The trial is lengthy and tedious, often lasting all day. Goering usually just sits and grins. He also occasionally scribbles a note and hands it to the German lawyer in front of him, but these notes are no longer surprising, so the lawyer always just puts them in his pocket.</p>
<p>Next to Goering sits Hess, looking haggard and gaunt. Hess always stares straight ahead. Ribbentrop, the champagne merchant turned diplomat, sits in the front row, with a stiff expression, but seems worried. In the back row sit Dönitz, Jodl, and Inkan. During the trial, they listen intently, and four translators constantly translate the questions and answers into English, French, Russian, and German. Each seat in the courtroom has an "interpreter," equipped with four buttons. You only need to turn one of the buttons to hear the language you understand.</p>
<p>The trial began on November 20 of last year and is now nearing completion. In six weeks, the verdict will be announced, and it will be clear who will be executed and who will escape. (Translated by Lin Xi from an Associated Press special dispatch)</p>
<h3>The Soviet Union's Attitude Towards Slavic Countries: Assuming the Role of Protector, Fully Supporting Roman Paul's Demands. Representatives from Hungary and Bulgaria Present Opinions to the Peace Conference</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Paris, 14th Broadcast: Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov today put forward the historical mission of the Soviet Union as the protector of all Slavic countries, expressing his views to the Paris Peace Conference, saying: "The era of European countries dividing up the Slavic countries is over." This statement by Molotov supports the calls from Romania and Yugoslavia for greater recognition of their status by the major powers. He stated: "Slavic countries must have equal status within the United Nations."</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Paris, 14th Broadcast: The Soviet bloc today launched a fierce attack on Greece at the Peace Conference. Representatives from Ukraine and Poland supported Bulgaria's demands on Greece, advocating the rejection of Greece's proposals. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Manuilsky accused Greece of obstructing Balkan peace.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Paris, 14th Broadcast: The Peace Conference today listened to the opinions of the Hungarian representatives on the draft peace treaty.</p>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 14th] Bulgarian Foreign Minister Kulishev, speaking at the Twenty-One Nation Peace Conference today, insisted that Bulgarian troops had not fought against the Anti-Hitler Alliance on any front. Although Bulgaria had colluded with Germany and declared war on Britain and the United States, Bulgarian troops only served as occupation forces and did not engage in any fighting against Yugoslavia or Greece. Bulgarian troops had fought against Germany in Serbia, Hungary, Austria, and Macedonia, with 32,000 soldiers killed in action, a fact acknowledged by Marshal Stalin in a letter to soldiers. The Bulgarian people do not understand why they are referred to as a former enemy in the draft peace treaty. Italy, as Hitler's first ally, is formally recognized as a co-belligerent. Does Bulgaria not have the right to be considered a co-belligerent?</p>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 13th] Bulgarian Prime Minister Georgiev stated tonight: "I will ask the Paris Peace Conference to recognize Bulgaria's status as a co-belligerent, reject Greece's demands to modify Bulgaria's northern strategic borders, raise Bulgaria's claim to Western Thrace, and reduce Bulgaria's reparations."</p>

<h3>The Montreux Convention Which the Soviet Union Demands to be Amended - A Special Compilation by Our Newspaper's Editorial Department</h3>
<p>Regarding the issue of the Turkish Dardanelles Strait, the Treaty of Lausanne was signed in 1923 after World War I, which generally stipulated: (1) Freedom of passage for merchant ships of all countries through the strait; (2) Each country may only send up to three warships of less than 10,000 tons into the Black Sea; (3) No fortresses or troops may be stationed within a certain area near the shores of the strait. This was clearly an unequal treaty for Turkey. Therefore, on April 12, 1936, Turkey sent a note to the signatory countries of the Treaty of Lausanne, requesting that countries amend the clauses in the treaty regarding the demilitarization and free passage of the Dardanelles Strait, roughly stating that Turkey, "in view of the changing situation in Europe, is prepared to negotiate with various countries in order to immediately establish an agreement that formulates a new system for the Dardanelles Strait under the necessary conditions for preserving the inviolability of Turkish territory and developing navigation between the Black Sea and the Mediterranean." After Turkey issued this note, governments of various countries immediately responded, expressing their willingness to consider the Turkish government's requests. A conference was then held in Montreux, Switzerland, on June 22 of the same year, attended by representatives from Britain, France, Japan, Russia, Yugoslavia, Romania, Greece, Bulgaria, and Turkey. The Turkish Foreign Minister Rüştü proposed a new draft convention, which was discussed by representatives from various countries. After various amendments, the convention was signed by representatives from various countries on July 20, 1936. The main points are excerpted below: (1) The signatory countries agree to replace the Treaty of Lausanne of July 24, 1923 with this convention. (The abolition of the Treaty of Lausanne implies permission for Turkey to establish defenses in the strait.) (2) Merchant ships of all countries can pass through day and night without restriction, but if Turkey is a member of a belligerent, it must navigate during the daytime according to designated routes. (3) Warships belonging to Black Sea countries with less than 15,000 tons can pass through, and only one vessel exceeding 15,000 tons can pass through each time. Submarines are absolutely prohibited from passing through. (4) It is stipulated that warships navigating in the strait are absolutely prohibited from using aircraft. (5) When Turkey itself is a member of a belligerent, the issue of warships passing through is entirely determined by the Turkish government. Turkey can also invoke this provision when it feels threatened by war. (6) Aircraft passing over the strait are only allowed to fly from east to west and from west to east, and are prohibited from flying from south to north and from north to south. (7) It is stipulated that the powers of the Strait Commission be transferred to the Turkish government. (8) The convention is valid for 30 years, and can be terminated by notification two years before the expiration date.</p>

<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 14th] General MacArthur issued a letter to soldiers on the first anniversary of the victory in the war against Japan, stating that this day is "not only a day of victory, but also a day of thanksgiving. We should prostrate ourselves and thank God that our democratic beliefs have shown the world that peace can be obtained and maintained by a government established by civilians."</p>
<h3>Zhu Shiming's Statement</h3>
<p>[Gaige News Agency, Tokyo, 14th] General Zhu Shiming, the Chinese representative to the Allied Control Council for Japan, issued a statement to the Japanese people on the anniversary of Japan's surrender. He first stated that the Chinese people, Japan's closest neighbors and the most severely affected by Japanese aggression, are deeply concerned about the Japanese people's sincere practice of establishing the fundamental principles of peace, freedom, and justice. He then stated that the United Nations has given Japan human rights and freedoms, which the Japanese people had not known before. Finally, he concluded his statement by offering the Japanese people the Chinese proverb "There is no century-long hatred in the world."</p>

<h3>Shanghai Uncovers International Smuggling Ring. Key Arrested Criminal, an American, Used to Work at the Executive Yuan's Relief and Rehabilitation Administration. Made a Fortune From Nylon Stockings, Earning US$10,000 Per Day. A Family Affair Involving Father, Sons, and Brothers.</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The U.S. Army Criminal Investigation Division recently uncovered a smuggling and tax evasion organization spanning Asia, America, and Europe worth tens of millions of U.S. dollars. One of the key criminals, Robert Warner, the leader of the Shanghai branch, was arrested by the local U.S. Navy authorities at 2:30 PM yesterday in Room 109 of the Huizhong Hotel, along with the Huangpu Branch Bureau. This man was formerly a captain in the U.S. Navy. After resigning, he was employed by the Executive Yuan's Relief and Rehabilitation Administration on July 2 of this year. His smuggling activities involved transporting nylon stockings (no less than 2,000 pairs) from New York and transporting raw silk from Shanghai to the United States and Paris. It is estimated that he profited more than US$10,000 per day from this illegal activity. The important members of this astonishing organization are all Warner's family members, including his father, David, who is a real estate merchant in New York, and his brothers Alfred, Louis, Oscar, etc., all of whom serve in the Navy. They have been using their positions to smuggle and evade taxes for some time. Alfred telegraphed home from Berlin, saying, "The Criminal Investigation Division has discovered it," and so on. Oscar was smuggling perfume out of Paris. Both of these men have now been arrested, but Louis has not yet been apprehended. His father, David, claims to be unaware of the situation, but in his letters to Robert, he repeatedly inquired about the sales of nylon stocking machines. The U.S. military authorities are still continuing their investigation to uncover the truth. It is not yet determined whether Robert will be tried in Shanghai or sent back to the United States.</p>
<h3>Customs Seizes 400 Million Yuan Worth of Smuggled Goods in One and a Half Months</h3>
<p>The smuggling of foreign goods is becoming increasingly rampant, and they are being dumped on the market at low prices, which is affecting legitimate industries and businesses. The customs has recently seized a large number of smuggled goods. From July 1 to yesterday, smuggled goods worth a total of 400 million yuan have been seized as a result of tip-offs from various parties within one and a half months. These goods are mostly nylon stockings, belts, socks, cigarettes, canned food, and miscellaneous items.</p>
<h3>One Way Out for National Industry: Universally Promoting Sales to Rural Areas. Discussing Close Liaison with National Cooperative Organizations. National Goods Manufacturers Invited to Tea Party.</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Wang Zhixin, General Manager of the China National Goods United Business Corporation, and Chen Zhongming, Manager of the Shanghai Branch of the National Cooperative Goods Supply and Marketing Department of the Ministry of Social Affairs, jointly invited national goods manufacturers and people from the financial community in the city to a tea party at 4:00 PM yesterday to seek closer ties between national cooperative organizations at all levels and to promote the widespread sale of national goods in vast rural areas. Fifty to sixty representatives from all walks of life attended, and Mayor Wu also arrived at 4:30 PM to participate. Wang Zhixin first stood up and gave a speech, stating that he wished to introduce the National Cooperative Goods Supply and Marketing Department to the national goods industry in the city in the spirit of friendship between the National Goods United Business Corporation and the national goods industry. The department has a long history in the inland areas and is meeting everyone in the city for the first time. The department is the supply and marketing organization for national cooperatives and intends to use this organization to sell national goods in the vast rural areas. When discussing the issue of the national goods industry today, everyone feels distressed. However, I firmly believe that the national goods industry still has a future. Although foreign goods are currently being dumped, and there are many obstacles to domestic production, I firmly believe that as long as the nation survives, national goods will inevitably have their own vitality. The most important task at present is how to connect production and consumption and cooperate with each other. Both the National Goods United Business Corporation and the National Supply Department should take responsibility for this. The current difficulties of the national goods industry are believed to be only temporary and can be resolved soon. During the War of Resistance, national goods factories made considerable contributions to the country. At the time of national reconstruction, we should further study and establish a three-dimensional linking mechanism between production and consumption. Opinions on this system have been detailed in the "Suggestions on Establishing a National Goods Production and Sales Chain System" and will not be repeated here. Now, I would like to invite Mayor Wu to give us guidance.</p>
<p>Mayor Wu then gave a speech amidst applause, stating that he agreed with the chairman's expression of confidence in the bright future of national goods. However, to make the country strong, we must increase national wealth, develop domestic industry, and expand the national goods industry. Although the current domestic situation still has various difficult problems waiting to be solved, because of our country's superior inherent conditions and vast territory, I am optimistic about the future of the political situation and the future of the country. Therefore, the future of the national goods industry is undoubtedly bright.</p>
<p>Worker Discipline Has Improved</p>
<p>Mayor Wu then discussed wages, stating that all labor disputes must be resolved rationally. For example, workers' demands for treatment must take into account the factory's responsibility, and we must never kill the chicken to get the egg. Moreover, our country has always been known for its low wages, but now they are even higher than in the United States, which feels very uncoordinated with our country's industry. Then, discussing worker discipline, Mayor Wu said that worker discipline in various countries has been generally poor after the war, but in the past two months, the issue of worker discipline in the city has improved significantly. Workers are now quite aware of the current situation of industry. In the future, this understanding is expected to deepen. If national goods factories need the local government to help mediate and so on, I am willing to do my best. If I can't do it, it is because of my lack of ability or because I am unable to do so, but I guarantee that my sincere desire to help you solve all difficulties will never be extinguished.</p>
<p>Mayor Wu was quite supportive of the National Supply Department's approach, but recognized that in the current situation, it may be difficult to compete with foreign goods in large cities. Therefore, he advocated that national goods should find ways to develop in rural areas and townships. He also hoped that national goods factories should use the latest scientific management methods and machinery. Mayor Wu said that people who recently returned from Taiwan after conducting inspections deeply felt that the most successful aspect of the Japanese administration of Taiwan was the emphasis on "saving." Therefore, he hoped that national goods manufacturers should study how to save money in all aspects besides machinery and technology. Facing reality, we must first consolidate the foundation of national goods in rural areas, and then find ways to compete with foreign goods in cities. Finally, Mayor Wu reiterated his determination to assist the national goods industry and resolve difficulties.</p>
<p>The Way for National Industry to Save Itself. Chen Zhongming then stood up and gave a speech, stating that in view of the approaching crisis in the national goods industry, he and Mr. Wang Zhihua have compiled a report calling for a self-rescue movement in the national goods industry. The way to save ourselves is that the production and consumption sectors should organize themselves and directly link and cooperate with each other. I believe that the national goods industry will have a future. Although national goods cannot compete with foreign goods in large cities at present, they can find a way out by promoting sales in rural townships. The National Supply Department currently has fourteen branches across the country. There are as many as 170,000 cooperative units in various places, with more than 18 million members. If this organization can be used as a distribution network, it will generate great power. However, I very much hope that national goods manufacturers and the financial community will lend a helping hand. After we have the power, we will do our best to improve in order to compete with foreign goods.</p>

<h3>Model Airplane Competition Awards Ceremony: Iron Birds in Aerial Performance, Low-Flying Over Heads, Unprecedented Spectacle at Fuxing Park</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Yesterday marked the first Air Force Day after the victory, and various Air Force organizations in this city held celebratory programs. The aircraft model competition hosted by the Shanghai branch of the Aviation Construction Association held its awards ceremony yesterday morning at Fuxing Park, presided over by Wu Guozhen, Chairman of the Association, with thousands of young students participating. The various prizes on the platform were dazzling, including silver cups, silver shields, brocade banners, and plaques. At 9:00 AM sharp, the assembly began with music. Mayor Wu delivered an opening address, stating in brief: The "August 13th" incident nine years ago marked the beginning of the Battle of Shanghai. On the following day, "August 14th," the Japanese Kisarazu Air Group launched a large-scale attack, and our Air Force immediately rose to meet them, resulting in the defeat and dispersal of the Kisarazu Air Group. Therefore, "August 14th" was designated as Air Force Day, which has great significance. Chongqing suffered repeated bombings because our Air Force was backward. A strong country must have a strong Air Force, and the repeated holding of aviation model competitions by the Aviation Construction Association is also intended to convey this meaning.</p>
<p>Subsequently, Shi Bangfan, the Secretary-General of the Association, delivered a speech. Mr. Shi is known as the "One-Armed General," having lost his arm in the early stages of the War of Resistance. He explained that the reason for holding the aircraft model competition at the Hongqiao Airport was of historical significance, because the first bullet of the War of Resistance was fired from the Hongqiao Airport, and that place was also an Air Force supply station, hence it was full of memories. Commander Xuan Tiewu stated that modern warfare is three-dimensional, so the position of the Air Force is extremely important. After the speeches, the awards ceremony began. Mayor Wu presented prizes to the winners of various categories, including: (1) Catapult Glider Model: First place Zheng Yushuo, second place Huang Shiyong, third place Ma Youzhang, highest record 42 seconds. (2) Hand-Launched Glider Model: First place Huang Shiyong, second place Zhou Zhongwen, third place Hu Gengsheng, highest record 27 seconds. (3) Stick-Propelled Glider Model: First place Song Wenliang, second place Chen Yongfu, third place Gao Faren, highest record 2 minutes 3 seconds. (4) Stick-Rubber Powered Model: First place Zhang Ruying, second place Ma Longzhang, third place Chen Guoxiang, highest record 3.6 seconds. (5) Fuselage-Propelled Glider Model: First place Song Wenliang, highest record 4 minutes. (6) Fuselage-Rubber Powered Model: First place Zhao Dawu, second place Zhang Shiquan, third place Chen Guoxiang. (7) Stick-Rubber Unofficial Highest Record: Qiu Guolong. (8) Zheng Xianji, and others, for gasoline powered model capable of flight. After the awards ceremony, staff members of the Association and the winners took a group photo. At that time, three P51 fighter planes and three B24 bombers performed aerial demonstrations to add to the excitement. The planes flew extremely low, almost skimming over people's heads, and the crowd applauded and cheered, making it an unprecedented spectacle. Unfortunately, the weather did not cooperate, and dark clouds suddenly gathered, followed by a heavy rain, causing everyone to scatter in a hurry.</p>
<h3>Issuing Bad Checks to Defraud 140 Million: General Manager of Tailai Florist Arrested</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Chen Shuding, a native of Ningbo, 31 years old, opened the Tailai Florist at Room 536, Zhonghui Building, serving as the general manager, traveling in a car, and living a luxurious lifestyle. The shop was divided into two departments, flowers and yarn, managed by Wu Daonan and Jing Juyuan respectively, with a considerable scale. A broker named Dai Keming, entrusted by Tian Changda of Huafeng Florist on June 24th, was tasked with selling 100 bales of Brazilian cotton, priced at 72,500 yuan per bale. Dai introduced Chen Shuding to Tian, and the deal was immediately struck. Chen immediately paid 80% of the payment with a check from Yichuan Bank, dated June 28th, signed by the Guoguang Coking Fuel Factory, totaling 17 million national currency. Tian gave Chen a warehouse receipt from Changfeng Foreign Firm. Unexpectedly, the check issued by Chen was returned due to insufficient funds when it was cashed. The victim reported it to the police. After the incident, Zhou Peiyu (a native of Baoshan) reported to the Huangpu Branch, stating that Chen Shuding of Tailai Florist had discounted a check dated July 3rd for 43.08 million yuan, but it was also returned when it was due, suspecting Chen of fraud. Zhou Guanghui, the head of the Criminal Division of the police station, immediately dispatched officer Wang Zhicheng to investigate after receiving the report. Late the previous night, they discovered that Chen Shuding was hiding in Room 304 of the Royal Hotel on North Sichuan Road and immediately went there to arrest him. Under interrogation, it was revealed that he had used the same method to commit fraud in about 20 cases, with a total amount defrauded of 140 million yuan. Currently, the victims are separately reporting to the police station to file their complaints.</p>

After the banquet began amidst music, Commander Guo Hanting delivered a speech, stating in brief: Nine years ago, at the beginning of the War of Resistance, our Air Force, under the leadership of the leader, fought the enemy amidst crude material conditions, shouldering the responsibility of defending the country. They inflicted significant blows on the enemy from the outset, shooting down a large number of Japanese planes in the Shanghai-Nanjing-Hangzhou area, achieving unexpected glorious results. Subsequently, they continued to engage the enemy with inferior equipment for five years. When the Pacific War broke out, they received assistance in materials and personnel from our ally, the United States, and their strength greatly increased. In recent years, they fought bravely, inflicting heavy losses on the enemy, until Japan surrendered. We celebrate here today to commemorate the difficult and arduous days woven with steel, blood, and sweat, and to wish China and the United States prosperity and friendship in the future. After Mr. Guo's speech, the entire audience stood up and "cheered," the atmosphere was enthusiastic. The band then played songs, and the guests danced enthusiastically. In addition, Deng Guoqing performed his skills. The event ended at approximately 9:00 PM.</p>

<h3>Wang Zhuchen Arrested and Taken to Court: Investigation Team Will Announce the Course of this Case</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The case of Wang Zhuchen being sued for encroachment and concealment of enemy and puppet property has long been investigated by the investigation team and the Enemy and Puppet Industry Management Bureau. It was deemed that Wang was indeed highly suspected, so a document was sent to the police to arrest Wang. After receiving the order, the Hongkou Branch dispatched patrol officer Jiang Tianfu, plainclothes detective Xu Daren, and plainclothes police officer Yang Weiguang at 9:30 AM on the 13th to secretly guard at 2 North Haining Road. They waited until 6:30 PM when Wang returned from outside, and the plainclothes police officers immediately stepped forward to show their official credentials and arrested him. After questioning, they found nine sheets of automobile parts catalogs on his person, and then, together with all the case files, they were sent to the District Prosecutor's Office for trial. It is noted that on the day of the arrest, attorney Pan Renxi sent a letter to this newspaper on his behalf, stating briefly that Wu Tianxiang was falsely accusing him out of spite. The transfer of materials was not a fact. All the repair machines in the factory, in addition to those purchased by himself, were taken over from the Special Commissioner's Office of the Ministry of Economic Affairs and borrowed from the Ya Iron and Steel Factory. According to the two committee members, Zhang Qingzhen and Wu Wangji, who were in charge of the case, the case has come to an end after being transferred to the court. However, the investigation team will announce the entire course of the case.</p>
<h3>Handling of Enemy and Puppet Houses: Investigation Team Decides to Review the Takeover Work</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The takeover work investigation team held a team meeting yesterday morning. Team leader Zhang Zhiben and committee members Zhang Qingzhen, Wu Wangji, Fan Zhengbo, and Cheng Zhongxing all attended. They discussed the investigation of the handling of enemy and puppet houses and decided to request the Enemy and Puppet Property Management Bureau to report in detail all enemy and puppet houses taken over and the handling process, as well as whether the current residents of each house have obtained them through legal procedures and whether they should enjoy such rights. The investigation team will review them one by one. It was also learned that the person who originally reported Sun Tianchang's case of aiding the enemy inquired with the investigation team yesterday afternoon about the latest progress of the case. According to Committee Member Zhang Qingzhen, Sun Tianchang is not a citizen of this country, so the details of this case are complex and serious. The team has contacted the Reformation Daily to inquire about the evidence of Sun's donation of planes. Other evidence is also being collected by the team.</p>
<h3>Impersonating Military Officers and Establishing a False Office: The Capture of Grand Swindler Zhu Yue – Establishment of Institutions Spreading from Beijing to Shanghai, Numerous Gang Members Plotting Wrongdoing</h3>
<p>Since February of this year, the First Pacification District Headquarters has repeatedly received intelligence that a person named Zhu Yue (original name Zhu Miao, alias Zhu Haiping, 43 years old, from Xiangtan, Hunan), claiming to be General Director of the Southeast District Special Envoy Office of the National Government Military Council, was using that name to set up a fake office in Shanghai at the home of the office's secretary, Li Chengji. Zhu himself had no fixed address. The fake office had eight departments: secretariat, staff, adjutant, intelligence, general affairs, transportation, military supplies, and military medicine, each with three sections, privately carving official seals and printing staff certificates, gun licenses, leave permits, etc. They were blatantly recruiting, arbitrarily appointing officials at all levels, and selling official titles. The price of an appointment as a lieutenant was 300,000 yuan, a field officer was 500,000 yuan, and a station chief was 3 million yuan, intending to extort and profit. After the department requested instructions from the superiors, they received a reply from the Military Council that there was no such organization and hoped to investigate and arrest them. Commander Tang Enbo ordered a strict investigation into Zhu's illegal facts. According to reports from various sources, Zhu Yue had been secretly planning to set up the fake office since March, and had successively arbitrarily appointed Li Chengji as the head of the secretariat, Zhang Xipei as the head of the general affairs department, a certain Dai as the head of the staff department, and Zhu Yue himself, using the alias Zhu Haiping, as the head of the intelligence department. Wu Chun was appointed as the deputy head of the intelligence department. He also appointed Zhou Yegeng as the major general district chief of the Pudong District, Long Zhen as the Shanghai station chief, Wang Baoming as the Chuansha station chief, Gu Junqing as the Nanhui station chief, Cai Huimin as the Baoshan station chief, Hu Lianchen as the Zhenjiang station chief, Liu Zhen as the Suzhou station chief, Zhou Xiangen as the Qingpu station chief, Zhang Rongsheng as the Shaoxing station chief, etc. The special stations and the staff of each station numbered about one hundred and ten people, mostly hooligans and local ruffians, with extremely complex elements. The fake office had many plainclothes guards, as well as radios, short guns, and all relevant military equipment. They were also engaged in recruiting disbanded soldiers and purchasing firearms, appointing a person named Wang Yan as the major general commander of the newly formed Fifth Division, attempting to expand the organization and plot wrongdoing. Furthermore, the magistrates of Qingpu, Chuansha, Baoshan, and other counties successively reported that Zhu's organization had been discovered in each county, formally writing to the county government requesting assistance, raising funds, and starting work. Based on the above information, the department further confirmed that Zhu Yue was impersonating senior military officers, privately establishing institutions, and illegally recruiting. The organization was a hooligan organization and may be used by others. It was decided to ban it to prevent harm to the local area. Therefore, a secret telegram was sent to the party and government police chiefs of Shanghai and Zhang Ximing, the sixth team leader of the Pacification Disciplinary Corps of the headquarters, ordering them to supervise and lead all personnel to conduct a detailed investigation. It was learned that the main suspect Zhu Yue was hiding in the building at No. 13, Fanyanli, Baike Road, Shanghai, and immediately dispatched officers to arrest him. Seven of his accomplices were also captured. At that time, Zhu attempted to resist with a gun, but fortunately, the team members bravely seized the gun, avoiding a disaster. Five handguns and forged documents, letters, and telegrams were seized on the spot. On the 28th, Li Chengji, the secretary of the fake office, was captured at No. 32, Hongqingfang, Mett Smedley Road. Official seals, appointment certificates, correspondence, and other items were seized. Subsequently, Wu Chun, the deputy director of the intelligence department, and Shen Xinfu (Zhenping), the district chief of Pudong District, were captured. At the same time, Jin De-, the leader of the Chuansha governing group stationed by the fake office, led plainclothes illegal personnel Zhan Shuxiong, Li Yun, Xu Xinkui, Zhang Jiangen, Zhu Yufei, Wu Mujin, and six others in kidnapping Wu Shuhai, a good citizen in Xiaowan Township, extorting 40 gold bars. After being reported, the sixth team of the Pacification Disciplinary Corps rushed to arrest all the gold criminals and seized two handguns and smoking paraphernalia. The criminals confessed that they were appointed by Zhu Yue and used his name to kidnap and extort people, which was a full confession. The entire case has thus been completely solved. The remaining criminals are being strictly interrogated. Since the case was solved, the department has held several court hearings. At the first hearing, Zhu Yue confessed that he had served as a guerrilla commander and was once captured by the enemy and released soon after. Recently, due to unemployment, he had submitted a report to his superiors to verify his work, but it was not fulfilled. Driven by vanity, he colluded with his old friend Li Chengji and various cadres to illegally organize a fake office, intending to summon forces, privately carving official seals and appointing official positions, using the name to defraud money. Li Chengji admitted to participating in the organization and serving as the head of the secretariat, but was deceived by (Zhu Yue) and was completely unaware of Zhu Yue's scam in advance. Currently, the authorities do not intend to further investigate the personnel in each county station who were falsely appointed, but earnestly hope that they will hand over the falsely issued orders and various false documents to the local county government or police agencies for collection.</p>

An elderly man among the passengers stepped forward and negotiated with the police, claiming that they were eager to return home and had been waiting for months with no ship available, hence their actions. The passengers echoed in unison. Seeing the situation, the officers were unable to enforce the order and had to seek instructions from their superiors. By 5:00 PM, the passengers were still unwilling to leave, and the ship was unable to depart. Whether it will be able to leave today is still uncertain.</p>

<h3>Ma Ketan Assigned to Attend World Education Conference in the United States; Talks About the Importance of the World Education Conference Before His Departure</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Ma Ketan, the principal of Jiangsu Provincial Jiangning Normal School, has been assigned to attend the National Education Association's World Conference of the Teaching Profession, which is being held in Endicott, New York, USA. Mr. Ma departed for the United States on the 13th on a US military plane. Before his departure, he told reporters in detail about the nature and importance of the World Education Conference. It is said that the main topics of the World Education Conference are divided into three categories:</p>
<p>Main Topics</p>
<p>(1) Formulation of an International Education Charter; (2) Post-war recovery of education and culture in war-torn countries; (3) International understanding and education for world citizenship. Mr. Ma also stated the importance of the conference: The National Education Association of the United States is composed of teachers and educators of all levels in the United States. This World Education Conference is entirely a joint conference of educational academic groups from all over the world and has no political overtones. Its purpose is to establish a world education charter from the perspective of world peace and mutual assistance, to improve world education methods, and to unite world educators to eliminate world wars and move towards world harmony.</p>
<p>Invitation to Participate</p>
<p>(2) The National Education Association of the United States has millions of members. Its ideas and propositions can not only represent the educational workers of the entire United States, but also influence the future youth and children of the United States. The association is the most democratic educational academic group and also an educational academic group that can influence the national education policy of the United States. Our country's education is moving towards democracy and should have more contact with the association to absorb its democratic spirit and enhance mutual assistance. Therefore, this invitation must be enthusiastically participated in. (3) The essence of our country's inherent culture and the educational facilities before and during the War of Resistance Against Japan are not fully understood by all countries in the world. It is planned to use this conference to make a systematic introduction and presentation so that educators from all countries in the world can understand China's efforts and progress in education and culture, thereby enhancing its international status. (4) During the War of Resistance Against Japan, our country's educational and cultural facilities suffered heavy damage from the enemy. Since the post-war recovery of world education and culture is one of the main topics of this conference, our representatives can truthfully state the situation of the damage and the urgency of the needs in order to gain the sympathy of educators from all countries in the world and obtain broad assistance from the people of all countries.</p>
<p>Presenting Solutions</p>
<p>(5) This conference will focus on discussing how to restrict narrow nationalism in education. The transformation of education in the Axis countries will be fundamentally resolved. Our country knows the most about the mistakes of Japan's past education. We can propose concrete solutions for transforming Japanese education at the meeting so that educators around the world will pay attention to this and provide General MacArthur with major references and adoption.</p>
<h3>Establishment of the Taiwan Provincial Compilation and Translation Institute</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Taipei, 14th] The Taiwan Provincial Compilation and Translation Institute has now been officially established. The institute is divided into school textbook groups, social materials groups, famous works translation groups, and Taiwan research groups. According to Director Xu Shouchang, because the people of Taiwan have been subjected to Japan's enslaving education, their understanding of the motherland is still rather thin. The institute now plans to compile and print a general history of China that everyone can read for the people of Taiwan. He also said that Japanese experts who study various problems in Taiwan have either been sent back to their country or will be sent back to their country. They have spent ten or decades of research, and some of the valuable works they have left behind must be sorted out and translated as valuable materials for studying Taiwan. Furthermore, to engage in this work, we must have the courage and effort of the people of the Jin and Tang Dynasties in translating Buddhist scriptures. It is also learned that the institute's funding is currently allocated by the Taiwan Provincial Government at 1.5 million Taiwan dollars, and more than 30 compilers and editors have been hired from the mainland.</p>
<h3>Central Government to Provide Relocation Expenses for Children of Servicemen, Paid by Schools</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 14th] The Ministry of Education has issued an order to all national secondary schools and above that the relocation expenses of children of personnel serving in central military agencies who are currently studying in national schools at all levels, who must relocate with the school, or who are studying in schools that are being transferred to local authorities or are not continuing to operate, or who are affiliated with recovered areas and voluntarily return to recovered areas, should be fully paid by the school after being approved by the Executive Yuan.</p>
<h3>Jinan University Entrance Examination</h3>

<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] National Jinan University's entrance examination for new students this summer began on the 8th of this month. As of the 12th, it had reached 6,000 people.

Candidates with numbers up to 3,200 will participate in the first session. The examination dates are the 17th and 18th of this month and are divided into four examination venues: The first examination venue is at Shanghai Provisional University, 295 Fuxing Middle Road, for candidates numbered 1 to 700; the second examination venue is at Zhen Dan University on Luban Road, for candidates numbered 701 to 2,000; the third examination venue is at Shanghai Municipal No. 1 Girls' Middle School, 9 Singapore Road (intersection of Haifang Road), for candidates numbered 2,001 to 2,700; the fourth examination venue is at Qingnian Middle School, 553 Xiafei Road (opposite the Paris Theater), for candidates numbered 2,701 to 3,200.

<h3>City Education Bureau Relocation Difficult to Realize Immediately</h3>
<p>Secretary Ma Expresses Opinions to Reporters</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The last Municipal Government meeting passed a resolution to relocate the Municipal Education and Public Works Bureaus back to their original locations in the city center. The buildings currently occupied by these two bureaus will be allocated to the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, Land Administration Bureau, etc. Yesterday, a reporter asked Secretary Ma Chonggan of the Municipal Education Bureau about this matter. According to him, although this proposal has been passed by the Municipal Government meeting, it is only a plan. In fact, it is difficult to realize immediately. It will only be possible after transportation in the city center is restored. He also said that the objects of the Education Bureau are all "people," with no inanimate objects, so the traffic problem is more serious than that of other bureaus.</p>

<h3>British Schools Suffer from "Full Enrollment"; Those Going to the UK for Inspection and Research Should Contact the British Council Representative in China in Advance; The British Council Declares It Cannot Provide School Placement Assistance</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report from Nanjing] According to a recent letter from Mr. Heller, an employee of the British Council in China, Vice Minister Hang of the Ministry of Education said that recently, Chinese personnel who have gone to the UK for inspection have requested the Council to arrange visits or research, such as arranging schedules, finding accommodation, and introducing institutions and schools. However, they did not contact the Council before going abroad and only notified them by telephone at the last minute. Because there was no preparation, it was extremely difficult to handle. He specifically offered his opinion, requesting that Chinese inspection or research personnel contact the Council's representative office in China in advance so that they can send a letter to London to prepare. There have also been inspection or research personnel who, after arriving in the UK, requested the Council to recommend them for admission to schools. However, because British schools are currently suffering from "full enrollment" and are extremely crowded, they will not be able to help with such matters in the future.</p>
<h3>Approved National Textbooks Do Not Allow Co-Selling with Old Approved Editions; Municipal Private Schools Can Obtain Purchase Orders from the Education Bureau</h3>
<p>National textbooks that have already been published include elementary school Chinese, general knowledge, arithmetic, high school Chinese, and junior high school Chinese, national history and geography, civics, and local autonomy. However, old approved editions from various publishers still flood the market, with huge quantities and expensive prices, and very low wholesale discounts. The Ministry of Education believes that this violates the regulations and has issued a strict order to all provinces and cities to investigate and prohibit this. It has also instructed the National Textbook Seven-Publisher Supply Center to ensure that the national textbooks are supplied without shortage and that old approved editions are no longer co-sold. It is learned that the Seven-Publisher Supply Center has already notified all publishers to strictly comply and conduct secret investigations and reports. In addition to reporting to the Ministry of Education, the original text of the letter to the publishers is recorded below: According to the Ministry of Education's National Letter No. 1036 and Telegraph No. 10476, the national textbooks should be distributed to all localities as soon as possible to ensure supply, and it has been heard that some publishers are reprinting old approved editions for the market. If any such cases are discovered, they will be severely punished. In addition to ordering the provincial and municipal departments and bureaus to conduct strict investigations and reports, you are ordered to comply, etc. This office already notified you on the 9th of this month with Shanghai 35 General Letter No. 98. Now, it is found that the Ministry of Education has stipulated that the approved textbooks published by each publisher, which are of the same subject as the national textbooks, can be sold together for half a year from the start of the distribution of the national textbook of that subject, but the remaining printing plates of the same subject should be sealed and absolutely prohibited from being reprinted and sold. Starting from the next semester, even the unsold old editions will not be allowed to be sold again. Violations will be subject to severe punishment. Furthermore, the national elementary school general knowledge, high school civics, Chinese, history, geography, and junior high school Chinese, Chinese history and geography, and civics have been published for many years. This office's printing plates for the approved editions of the same subject were all destroyed in Chongqing. Judging from the situation, there should be no more cases of reprinting for the market. In addition to having requested the Ministry of Education to issue a notice to the provincial and municipal governments to strictly investigate and prohibit this, and to punish according to the regulations, it is hoped that all publishers will conduct their own secret investigations and reports, and take steps to prohibit this. As for the national elementary school arithmetic textbook, it began to be supplied in the Shanghai area in the spring of the 35th year. The approved edition could have been supplied concurrently for one semester. Because it is feared that some provinces may not have started selling it this semester, this office has requested the Ministry of Education to allow it to be sold until the end of the semester, considering the obstruction of transportation. Please consider this. Regarding the above-mentioned sections on old editions of the same subject, it is feared that responsible personnel in each branch may not yet be aware of it. Therefore, it is described in detail, and you are requested to inform them separately and pay close attention.</p>
<p>Another report: Municipal national schools in this city can go to the National Education Office of the Municipal Education Bureau to obtain distribution purchase orders, which can be used to order from major bookstores.</p>

<h3>Chairman Concerned About the Industrial and Commercial Crisis; Chief Secretary Urges Concrete Solutions; Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Requests Swift Government Implementation</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Guling on the Thirteenth by Our Newspaper] Today, our reporter visited Wu Dingchang to inquire about the petition from the Shanghai industrial and commercial community. He said that the Chairman is very concerned about this matter, understands it deeply, and suggests that the representatives can have detailed discussions with the relevant authorities to seek solutions. Wu continued that the government authorities have already prepared measures to address the industrial and commercial crisis, but it is questionable whether they can address the actual difficulties faced by the industrial and commercial community. The key is not difficult to solve; the industrial and commercial community only needs to provide concrete methods to the relevant authorities, and the government can prescribe the right remedy. For example, regarding the second principle in the recommendations, the urgent implementation of production loans, he believes that the government will certainly agree, but the industrial and commercial community must propose a method to ensure that the loans are indeed used for production and not for speculation. Regarding the current situation, Wu personally observed that there is still a period of stalemate. The withdrawal of troops from northern Jiangsu and the local governments remain the central issues. The Communist Party believes that it is not in its interest, so it insists on not yielding, and the method for ending the conflict has not yet been found.</p>
<p>[News from Our Newspaper] The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce held a board meeting at 3:00 PM yesterday to listen to the reports of the delegation and to discuss how to continue to handle the request for the government to quickly determine economic policies to resolve the industrial and commercial crisis. After the representatives reported, it was decided to (1) send a telegram to Chairman Jiang in Guling and President Song, explaining the petition matters and requesting swift implementation, and requesting President Song to specify a time and place so that the representatives can meet with him, (2) maintain Chairman Jiang's proclamation of the fourteenth, requesting that the claims are carried out to resolve the economic crisis, (3) advise the Communist Party to accept the Chairman's proclamation, comply with the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference, and withdraw from the transportation lines designated by the government to facilitate transportation and restore production.</p>
<p>Yesterday, our newspaper interviewed petition representative Pan Shihao about the details of the negotiations with the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Economic Affairs in Nanjing, which are recorded below.</p>
<p>Principles of Industrial Loans: Must Avoid Inflation; Small and Medium-Sized Industries Should Be Rescued First</p>
<p>The delegation requested industrial loans totaling 200 billion yuan. However, it was stated that there is a distinction between what is urgent and what is important, and the order in which they should be handled. The delegation stated that the purpose of the industrial loans is twofold: (1) to increase production, so that material goods increase and currency returns to the market. This would not only avoid the danger of inflation but also have the potential to suppress prices. (2) To repay high-interest loans from the black market with low-interest industrial loans. This would prevent currency inflation in the market and reduce industrial costs. The Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Economic Affairs expressed sympathy with these principles. However, they believed that the national finances were difficult, and that increasing the issuance of banknotes should be avoided as much as possible. Furthermore, the Ministry of Economic Affairs believed that the current difficulties of industry lie in capital, technology, labor, management, and other aspects, and that efforts should be made in all these areas. Relying solely on industrial loans is insufficient. However, the Ministry of Economic Affairs stated that the particularly acute difficulties of small and medium-sized industries should be urgently alleviated. It was also stated that a separate organization will be established to handle loan disbursement and management.</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of the existence of the Joint Treasury and the connection between the Central Bank and ordinary banks, the Ministry of Finance stated that this matter is under the direction of President Song and should be referred to him. However, it was added that the Joint Treasury is a wartime institution. Now that the situation has changed, its policies should be adjusted accordingly. Furthermore, the government is not ignoring industrial loans. In addition to the four industries of salt, wheat, silk, and tea, which have already received significant loans, other important industries are also under consideration. Whether the loans will be in the form of banknotes or physical goods will be discussed in detail to ensure that they do not cause inflation or high prices.</p>
<p>Tax Laws Still Need to Be Modified; Grading of Business Tax; Lenient Handling of License Tax</p>
<p>The delegation believed that the current simplified tax collection method for profit tax is difficult to implement because it requires the collection of profit tax for the 34th year. The delegation particularly criticized the tax collection procedures for business tax in various regions. The Direct Tax Department of the Ministry of Finance stated that the collection of profit tax should be simplified and efficient to resolve this backlog. If there are cases of harassment in the collection of business tax, they should be strictly rectified. It was also stated that the current business tax law was established during wartime. Now that the situation has changed, it should be revised accordingly. For example, the grading of tax rates for wholesale, retail, and manufacturing is under consideration. The stamp tax is originally a document tax. Unless people are intentionally avoiding stamp duties by not listing documents, those who do not have documents due to good customs should naturally not be required to pay stamp duties. Regarding business license tax, originally was a measure to combat monopolies. Recently, the Shanghai Municipal Government has increased the number of types of licenses and is forcibly increasing tax amounts by estimating assets. The delegation specifically requested relief. The Local Tax Department of the Ministry of Finance stated that 70% of the current business tax has been allocated to the Shanghai Municipal Government. Therefore, business license tax should be handled leniently according to law. If there are any categories or procedures that exceed the scope, they should be stopped.</p>
<p>The delegation also stated to the Ministry of Economic Affairs that if active assistance such as industrial loans is difficult to implement in the short term, then passive relief measures such as tax exemptions and reductions should be considered. The Ministry of Economic Affairs stated that the tax rate for production industries should be reduced and agreed to consult with the Ministry of Finance on a solution.</p>
<p>Minister Wang Encourages Harmony and Frugality; Monthly Consumption of 20 Billion; President Song Elusive</p>
<p>It is reported that Minister Wang of the Ministry of Economic Affairs expressed his sentiments to the representatives, stating that the current monthly income from banquet taxes and entertainment taxes in Shanghai is considerable. Based on this income, the amount of materials wasted in this area is estimated to be around 20 billion yuan per month. In these times of industrial and commercial difficulty, this phenomenon should not exist. He requested that the representatives return to Shanghai and urge all industries to pledge to practice frugality and start from the basics. The representatives all expressed agreement. Pan Shihao also stated that diligence and frugality are the starting points for this petition. According to Pan, diligence means increasing production, and to increase production, it is necessary to maintain industry and prevent the pressure of foreign imports on domestic industry. Frugality means reducing consumption, and to reduce consumption, it is necessary to prohibit the import of luxury goods and non-essential goods.</p>
<p>It is said that the most unfortunate thing was that President Song had flown to Shanghai the day before the delegation arrived in Nanjing. By the evening the delegation arrived in Shanghai, an attempt was made by a certain important official to arrange a meeting with President Song, but President Song stated that he had already scheduled a flight back to Nanjing the next morning and was unable to meet.</p>
<p>It is also rumored that the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce will convene a general meeting of all members within the week to report on the petition process and discuss the countermeasures that the Chamber of Commerce should take in response to the government's attitude.</p>
<h3>Guang Gang and Large Investors Short-Sell, Chinese Stocks Mostly Follow the Downward Trend</h3>
<p>Chinese stocks yesterday looked bleak as Guang Gang dumped Yong Yarn, and large investors inclined towards short-selling. Initially, it was still possible to maintain levels, remaining mostly flat. Yong Yarn started high at 690 yuan, Mei Ya at 3880 yuan, Jingfu at 223 yuan, Xinguang at 220 yuan, Qinxing at 168 yuan, but then gradually weakened. Large investors were mostly on the sidelines, lacking support, and the amount of shares available became excessive. Around noon, a sudden sharp decline occurred, with trading volume desolately low. Black market stocks had the air of a "beautiful sunset." The less popular stocks were not affected. As a result, Yong Yarn fell slightly less than half a percent from the previous close, while Mei Ya, Jingfu, Xinguang, and Qinxing each fell slightly more than half a percent. The less popular small and medium-sized stocks were moderate, with small stocks slightly falling. Veteran stocks showed little movement.</p>
<p>Foreign stocks showed slight stability. British Alliance stocks later surpassed Yi Yarn, slightly higher. Yi Yarn then rose from 7600 yuan to 7800 yuan, and the others also slightly increased. As a result, compared with the previous closing, Meilian Industry and Guanggang Industry slightly rose, while the rest remained flat.</p>
<h3>Gold and Banknotes Continue to Fall</h3>
<p>Yesterday, gold prices continued to fall due to long positions being liquidated, causing a rebound. The Hong Kong gold market also reported a slight decrease to 362 yuan. Multiples did not intend to last long. After an opening high of 1.985 million, sellers continued to exert pressure. However, it lingered around 1.97 million for a long time initially. After 10:00 AM, the Central Bank allocated 47 bars at a price of 1.97 million. After they entered the market, it changed from flat to weak. Near noon, a sudden surge in sales occurred, dropping below 1.945 million at noon, and then stabilized slightly. In the afternoon, trading was sparse and prices were flat. As a result, compared to the previous closing, it continued to decrease by 22,000. Gold ornaments were priced as low as 200,080. Silver bullion and silver dollars were flat. The black market interest rates varied, and the dark interest rates had slight variations, ranging roughly from 0.9% to 1.4%.</p>
<p>Foreign currencies fell across the board. Although the opening price for US dollars was 2590 yuan, there was no need for them. After the opening, it continued to decline. Later, as the gold market weakened, it dropped below 2550 yuan at noon. It was difficult to recover in the afternoon. As a result, it continued to fall by 20 yuan compared to the previous closing. Hong Kong dollars suddenly had a large supply from a certain British foreign firm, and Guanggang actively sold telegraphic transfers, decreasing from 577 yuan to below 565 yuan. As a result, it continued to fall by 9 yuan. The Hong Kong exchange rate fell to 556 yuan, the Indian exchange rate to 668 yuan, and the British exchange rate to 8,900. US exchange rates remained unchanged.</p>
<h3>Government Bonds Suddenly Surge</h3>
<p>Government bonds have been stable for days, but yesterday, buying interest suddenly increased. The North Gang and a certain firm on the seventh floor jointly absorbed more than one million yuan. Idle cash flow could not withstand the eagerness of one or two large investors, and asking prices were easily increased. Ding-type bonds had already caught up with and may even surpass Bing-type bonds. Bing-type bonds rose from 630 yuan to 800 yuan, Ding-type bonds rose from 640 yuan to 770 yuan, Ding-type bonds rose from 620 yuan to 740 yuan, and Jia-Yi-type bonds rose from 490 yuan to 540 yuan, all ending at high prices. As a result, compared to the previous closing, Jia-Yi-type bonds rose 120 yuan, Bing-type bonds rose 150 yuan, Ding-type bonds rose 140 yuan, and Ding-type bonds also rose 130 yuan.</p>
<h3>Huangshan New Mao Feng Tea Opens at Over 600,000</h3>
<p>The domestic sales of red and green tea continue, and the process is elegant. Ping Shui New Longjing Tea has advanced again. According to industry sources, the Tianjin tea market has also been quite active in recent days, as it has not been held for a long time and the reserves are low. Thus, under the circumstances of more monks than gruel, people's hearts are soaring. Currently, Huangshan New Mao Feng Tea has opened at 600,000 to 650,000 yuan per dan. As for transactions in this city's foreign firms, there are still many inquiries about Chen Zhen Mei and Chen Te Gong teas. At the same time, Indian tea merchants are paying closer attention to Taiwan fine red tea, and prices are like a horse with the reins off. Currently, Yu Long Foreign Firm purchased 200 boxes, setting a new high of 75,000 yuan per dan. The rest are quite stable. It is also heard that on the 20th of this month, Jardine Matheson, Xie Xin, Wu Chang, and others will ship considerable amounts of red and green tea to Europe and the United States from Yu Tai, Xin Hua, and other firms.</p>
<h3>Chamber of Commerce to Form European and American Inspection Team</h3>
<p>[News from Our Newspaper] Yesterday, the board meeting of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce discussed major issues such as initiating the organization of a European and American industrial and commercial inspection team for the purpose of observation and establishing a branch office in Gaoqiao Town.</p>
<h3>The Trend of Black and White Straight Cotton Flannel</h3>
<p>Straight cotton flannel comes in two types, black and white. White only sells temporarily in the summer, while black sells year-round, so people in the industry call it "everyone's goods." In the past, when mandarin jackets and melon capes were popular, yuan qing straight cotton flannel was extremely popular. Brands such as Rong Tai 15330, He Feng 21127, De Ji 13336, An Li Ju Bao Pen, and Gong Yi Jin Bao Ta were famous among both locals and out-of-towners. Later, as melon cape and mandarin jackets were gradually eliminated, sales greatly decreased. At the same time, domestic factories continued to produce them. Recently, it has completely relied on the shoe trade. Sales have decreased by three-quarters. Since the victory last year, the trend has gradually improved due to the strong purchases from out-of-towners. The market is gradually becoming prosperous. The demand from out-of-towners continues, and there is little inventory in the market, so prices are becoming stronger again. Yin Feng's Cai Shen Tiger brand is even more popular. White straight cotton flannel has long since gone out of season, so even the well-known 222 has disappeared.</p>
<h3>Problems with the Purchase of Raw Silk: Various Parties Unable to Confirm; Hua Silk's Exchange for Vietnamese Rice and Coal is Under Negotiation</h3>
<p>[News from Our Newspaper] Yesterday, the newspaper reported that the government will purchase raw silk to solve the difficulties of silk merchants, and that the Central Trust Bureau will purchase it at a price based on production costs. The reporter recently inquired with relevant parties, but they were unable to confirm it. Officials from the Central Bank and the Central Trust Bureau stated that they had not heard of this matter. Furthermore, they said that if purchased at a price of 3.8 million yuan per dan based on production costs, it would not be possible in reality. According to reliable sources, if the government were to purchase raw silk at the cost of production, then (1) how would the huge deficit be compensated? (2) Other industries besides raw silk would also apply for purchases. Before these two difficulties are resolved, it seems impossible for the government to purchase it rashly. It is heard that recently, relevant parties are conducting negotiations with France for a barter trade. The purpose is to exchange China's raw silk for Hongji coal and rice from French Vietnam. It is heard that this barter negotiation has now reached a mature stage. In the future, it will also be coordinated with various competent authorities to allocate the materials obtained through barter. It is planned to use the surplus from the barter to subsidize the silk merchants. It is said that this method is more reasonable and in line with the facts, and difficulties should not arise during implementation.</p>
<h3>Yarn Sales Sluggish; Grey Cloth Continues to Rise</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the yarn market prices were sluggish, and there were only sporadic purchases from out-of-towners. Traders' minds were very thin, and holders were inclined to sell, so each yarn count fell by 10,000 yuan. The trend is fragile. At noon, the Textile Construction Company opened yarn as usual, and the price was similar to the previous period. However, the 32-count Double Strand Peach brand yarn was marked down 30,000 yuan.</p>
<p>The grey cloth market was as strong as ever. Both local merchants and dyeing factories had scattered needs. The fine cloth produced by private factories was still being purchased in Fujian and Guangdong, so the market continued to rise by 500 yuan. However, serge remained flat. Yin Dan Shi Lin cloth gradually became more colorful, but the fine cloth from Qingdao was not selling well.</p>
<h3>Third Phase of Low-Priced Sugar</h3>
<p>General sales began yesterday.</p>
<p>Limited to three catties per person.</p>
<p>The popular-priced edible sugar managed by the South Goods Commercial Guild under order of the government began the third phase of general sales yesterday (the 14th). The method remains the same, with a maximum of three catties per person, sold from 1:00 PM to 3:00 PM daily. The sales this time are still of Taiwan middle grade sugar.</p>
<p>Also, it was reported that the current market for middle-grade white sugar is short on spot goods. Prices have risen by more than 10% in two days and have exceeded the 130,000 yuan mark. It is rumored that the tenth allocation of Taiwan sugar may change to raw sand red sugar allocated to the trading companies. The quota is larger, and the market price is expected to ease. The Trade Guild has Jian Gang opening Diao Qing, 118 packages, 89,000 yuan, Shantou Gang opening Chong Ti Qing, 93,500 yuan to 4,000 yuan, Huang Gang Qing, 92,000 yuan, a total of more than 200 packages, Zhi Yang Bai, 80 packages, 118,000 yuan, Huizhou Bai, 30 packages, 135,000 yuan, Shang Bing Bai, 40 packages, 150,000 yuan, Xinghua Gang opening Gong Fen Bai, two hundred plus baskets, 138,000-137,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Coal Market Changes from Soft to Firm</h3>
<p>The price of white coal chunks in the coal market has risen due to news from Tianjin buyers and the thin reserves of white coal chunks here. Traders' appetite has recovered, and the market is changing from soft to firm. All goods have seen slight increases. Sales of white coal powder are extremely sluggish, with little trade. Bituminous coal chunks have appropriate supply and demand, and the market is still flat. Bituminous coal powder is affected by kerosene, and factory sales are sluggish. The Fuel Management Committee of the Ministry of Economic Affairs will automatically reduce the allocated price of Kai Ping No. 2 powder by 10,000 yuan and Kai Ping No. 1 powder by 5,000 yuan, effective immediately. There is no change in Kai Ping chunk coal. It is heard that the allocated prices of white coal powder and Hongji powder will also be reduced in the near future.</p>
<h3>Rice Prices Firm</h3>
<p>Yesterday, more than 4,000 shi of rice arrived in both the northern and southern markets. New japonica rice was scarce and rebounded by 1,000-2,000 yuan. High-quality white yuan rice was also tight, while medium-quality rice was still sluggish. White japonica rice was generally bid higher. Flour trading closed similarly, but Bing Chuan flour rose slightly by 100 yuan. The north still preferred white wheat. The market for northern yellow soybeans was balanced between arrival and sales, and the prices increased sharply. Supply and demand in the oil market were evenly matched. At noon, the factory had a strong selling attitude, and all oils decreased by a small thousand yuan. Soybean cake digestion was unsatisfactory, and it decreased by 200-300 yuan. Wheat bran was down a small 100-200 yuan.</p>
<h3>Man-made Silk Plummets</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the price of man-made silk continued to decline. The market supply and demand were imbalanced, and sentiment was weak. No. 120 Heavenly Bridge brand, which initially traded at 1.656 million yuan, fell in a straight line, finally settling at 1.61 million yuan. Miscellaneous brands of No. 120, also with a luster, dropped slightly to 670,000 yuan. Semi-gloss and No. 150 brands with luster, etc., were down by 340,000 yuan compared to the previous day. The China Textile Corporation and the Central Trust Bureau, among others, were all releasing goods today, which led to the downward trend in yesterday's market. Factory managers, due to the continued weakness of gold prices, are adopting a wait-and-see approach, and transactions are rare. Bidding prices are not short, and the silk fabric market is gradually becoming prosperous. Quilt covers experienced some trading, with prices rising by 120,000 yuan, while the remaining items were quoted at the same prices as the previous day.</p>
<h3>London Chinese Bonds - Market Stagnant and Unchanged</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 14th Dispatch] Trading on the London Stock Exchange remained sluggish yesterday, but the market trend was stable. Chinese bonds remained stagnant and unchanged.</p>
<h3>Large Quantities of Coal and Wheat Arrive in Shanghai</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The "Filen Snowman Lino," managed by Walun Foreign Firm, carrying over 7,400 tons of wheat from Galveston (transliteration), USA, was imported yesterday and is currently berthed at floating docks No. 41 and 42 for unloading. Furthermore, the "Frank Olmenker," an agent of Jardine Matheson, carrying over 8,000 tons of coal from Nanaimo (transliteration), Canada, also arrived in Shanghai yesterday afternoon and is currently berthed at the Yitaixing North Wharf for unloading.</p>
<h3>Dried Longan Rises</h3>
<p>The upper-grade dried longan had not been available for a long time. Recently, as the price of Guiyuan longan has gradually risen, prices have also tightened. More than twenty pieces were available on the market yesterday, with prices increasing by thirty to forty percent compared to before.</p>

<h3>A Record of Investigating the Qiantang Project</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent Chu Yusheng, Jiashang Dispatch from Our Newspaper, 13th</p>
<p>The Qiantang Seawall is related to the lives and properties of the counties south of the Yangtze River, which is a well-known fact. The dangerous situation of the seawall collapsing has also been publicized and appealed by many people, which has led to the emergency repair that passed into the construction and improvement project. Originally, during the emergency repair period, the Emergency Repair Committee of Qiantang Seawall was established to temporarily alleviate the urgent situation.</p>
<p>The Beginning of the Investigation</p>
<p>Later, with the attention of the central authorities, it was deemed that the management of the Qiantang River was as important as the management of the Yellow River. As a result, the Zhejiang Provincial Government was ordered to establish the Seawall Engineering Bureau, and Mao Yisheng, the builder of the Qiantang River Bridge and a well-known domestic engineer, was appointed as the director. Wang Xiangzhen, a hydraulic engineering expert who studied in the United States and the former chief engineer of the Grand Canal Rehabilitation Committee, was appointed as the deputy director and chief engineer. Wu Shoupeng, the commissioner of the tenth district of Zhejiang Province and a mechanical engineer, was appointed as the deputy director. Shao Fuwu, an expert in harbor engineering, Feng Dan, an expert in water conservancy engineering, and Tang Zhenxu, a hydraulic engineering expert who studied in the United States and the current director of the Engineering Planning Group of the Executive Yuan, were appointed as the deputy chief engineers. Four divisions and one office were established under them. Shao Fuwu also served as the director of the Design Division, Feng Dan also served as the director of the Engineering Division, Jin Pengnian served as the director of the Material Division, and Shen Baozhang served as the director of the Secretariat. Chen Qicui served as the director of the Accounting Office. Hou Jiayuan, Xue Zhuobin, Zhang Zili, Huang Jiahua, Zheng Hua, Kang Shizhen, Zhu Guoyuan, Yang Peijun, Huang Yan, Du De, Geng Desheng, White Hoshi, Kang Yi, Dickheimer, Meiano, and Tang Zhenxu were also hired as consulting engineers. Hou was the director of the Engineering Planning Group of the Executive Yuan and a railway expert, Xue was the chief engineer of the Yongpu Railway Bureau, and Zheng was the former director of the Beijing-Shanghai Railway Bureau, a well-known bridge engineer. Kang was the chairman of the Department of Civil Engineering at Central University and a highway expert, Zhu was the director of the Structural Department of the Shanghai Public Works Bureau, Yang was a professor at Jiaotong University, Huang was an engineer at the Yongpu Railway Bureau, Du was the American chief engineer of the Engineering Planning Group of the Executive Yuan, Huai was a British hydraulic engineer, Kang was a Danish bridge engineer, Dick was the American Deputy edge engineer of the Engineering Planning Group, Zhang was the director of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway Bureau, Huang was the chief engineer of the Zhejiang-Fujian branch of the Joint Transport Bureau, Mei was the American engineer of the Joint Relief Agency, and Geng was the Dutch port engineer, an authority on Far East harbor engineering. Looking at this list of distinguished engineering experts, we should truly wish the people of Jiangnan well.</p>
<p>The Seawall Engineering Bureau was established in Hangzhou on August 1. Before that, Shen, the chairman of the Zhejiang Provincial Government, invited all the consulting engineers to form the Qiantang River Seawall Engineering Investigation Group to investigate the seawall. Tang Zhenxu also served as the secretary-general of the group. They held a meeting for six days in the Shanghai Municipal Government Building, and the group departed for Hangzhou on the 10th. They set off at 8:00 a.m. on the 11th, and the reporter also went along. This was my fourth time visiting the seawall. The first two times were alone, the third time was with a group, and this time I came with an engineering academic group, so naturally I felt particularly interested. Shen Honglie, the chairman of the Zhejiang Provincial Government, Pi Zuoqiong, the director of the Construction Department, Sun Shoupei, the director of the Water Conservancy Bureau, Feng Dan, the chief engineer of the Emergency Repair Engineering Office, and Wu Shoupeng, the commissioner of the Tenth District, had already been waiting in Haining. The car glided through the slightly better but unfinished highway and arrived in Haining. The people stood at the door and watched with eager eyes, expressing the infinite hope that the people of Zhejiang Province placed on these many engineers.</p>
<p>The Meaning of Saving at the Moment</p>
<p>On the same day, I went to see the emergency repair project of Chen Wengang twice, and did not return to Haining until late at night. They discussed and studied the nature of the water and the method of resisting the water flow on the newly built Chai Tang. I eagerly asked Director Liu, who also served as the chief engineer, Wang Huzhen. He said, "The most important thing at the moment is to strengthen the Tang base and protect the Tang body. However, there are many ways to protect the Tang body, such as driving wooden piles into the bottom of the water to form a far-reaching arc in front of the Tang base to form a plate head, which can also be tried." Hou Jiayuan, who had a large body, also interjected to me, "The most necessary urgent matter at the moment is to strengthen the protection of the Tang that has not collapsed and to repair the Tang that has collapsed." Xue Zhuobin also said: "The mud in front and behind Tang is worth studying."</p>
<p>We stayed in Haining that night. I anxiously asked Mao Yisheng: "Is the current emergency repair project worth it?" He said: "This is just a temporary solution. It cannot be guaranteed that the original stone Tang will be in danger again this autumn tide. However, there are technicians stationed there who can repair it as it collapses. The mission of the Engineering Bureau is to repair the collapsed seawall and build a formal Qiantang project." We talked for a long time, from Qian Wusu Wang's construction of the Six Harmonies Pagoda to the stone Tang of the Houzhao Gate, to Kangxi and Qianlong's emphasis on the seawall, and the repair projects since the Republic of China. We even talked about the foreign history of the Qiantang Seawall, such as Qian Wei ordering people to shoot the sea tide to build the Tang base and the sitting of Chen Gelao in Haining during the Qing Dynasty, and Qianlong's two visits to Ning.</p>

<p>The Trip to the Sea God Temple</p>
<p>The next day, facing the Chao, we went to the Sea God Temple. The engineers paid attention to the seawall construction map engraved on the walls and stones. Later, we hurried on our way. Meiano, an engineer from the Joint Relief Agency, drove a jeep from Hangzhou to join us, adding a new force, and we moved forward mightily. Passing through the place where Feng Dan and I overturned and were injured last time, we arrived at the Zhao Wei Character Tang of the Tenth Fort, which was ten kilometers away from Haining. Nearly a hundred workers were working here because nearly twenty-five meters of the mouth had been breached in early August. Tang Zhenxu pointed to me and said that in front of the stone Tang, there was a row of wooden piles, and there were some stones in front of and behind the wooden piles, which was called "Tan Shui". "Tan Shui" is used to defend the stone Tang. Along the way, Sun Shoupei repeatedly explained the importance of the soil behind the stone Tang, which he called the "Maginot Line" on the sea.</p>
<p>Huang Yan told me: "The Tang base of the seawall must be guarded by mud, and Tan Shui is also a good method of guarding. Now the mud in front and behind Tang is loose, and some Tan Shui are broken, so naturally it will collapse." He pretended to be a short figure and used this to stand upright as a metaphor for me, and said, "It's like a person with a knee and leg disease. If there is something to support him when he stands up straight, he can stand up straight, but if you take the thing away, he will naturally fall."</p>
<p>Collapsed Stone Tang</p>
<p>Driving forward again, the car sped through the deep reeds on both sides. Several cars were coming towards us, and we had to wait on the narrow side of the road, letting the oncoming cars force them away before we could continue. Along the way, we saw many salt fields.</p>
<p>We slid past the edge of Jianshan, which is a natural "Tang" that is closely connected to the stone Tang. We also passed through Huangwan and rushed through Ganpu. There are many people here, and city walls have been built. Many seagoing ships used to come here to trade, and the city walls were used to defend the territory.</p>
<p>We crossed the Changchuan Dam, where the self-defense force had once been taboo. At the foot of Qinshan, it is said that Qin Shihuang moved mountains and overturned the sea to prepare for seeking immortality in the East Sea, and drove this mountain to guide the ferry, so it is named Qinshan. Below Qinshan is a man-made stone Tang. We got off the car and went to the stone Tang. Some of the Tang bodies were still intact. Kang Shizhen told me: "The soil here is more viscous than the Haining side. The Haining side is mostly fine sand, so the Tang base here is firmer." Looking back from the stone Tang, we saw beacon towers. When pirates and Japanese pirates invaded in the past, they used beacon fires to warn. Therefore, we even thought that the name of the Qiantang "Fort" was also an abbreviation for the fortress.</p>
<p>When we arrived at Dengya Bridge, many of the Tang bodies here were damaged. Yang Peijun told me: "According to the report, there are 240 wooden piles under each Zhang of the stone Tang. The collapse of the stone Tang is mostly due to the damage of the base piles. The collapse of the Haining side is due to the erosion of the water, and the collapse of the Haiyan side is because of the lack of mud to protect the Tang behind the Tang body. The relationship of the piles is the main cause of the collapse." Huang Yan and Kang Shizhen both said: "We admire the stone Tang project very much. Think about how difficult it is for such large stones to be moved by manpower one by one. Qianlong once spent 15 million taels of silver to repair the Tang, which is even more commendable. However, later generations, because they depended on it, neglected to repair it, which led to such collapse." We stood at the collapsed stone Tang, and to the south was a vast river and sea. Not far from the Tang, there were three small mountains. Sun Shoupei pointed to us the distant mountain, named Chenshan. Between Chenshan and Qinshan is the Eastern Port. He had inspected it with Fang Xiusi, a German authority on water conservancy, and later he personally worked here. He said: "The final low water level is seven meters deep, and the largest ship draft must be 38 feet and 6 inches. Although dredging is possible, it is very laborious. Fortunately, the Shanghai Concession has now been recovered." He pointed to a further mountain and explained that this is Washan, and the three small mountains in front are not famous mountains, and one is named Baitashan. The self-defense force that rebelled had drifted here. Later, they had no fresh water to eat and landed and were dealt with.</p>
<p>There are eighteen breaches in Dengya Bridge, but most of the Tang bodies are damaged and the Tang bases are still good. The Qiangxiu project in the Yanping section is considered to have come to an end. More than 50 technicians and more than 2,000 workers were mobilized, and five Tangs were built, with a total earthwork of more than 54,800 squares.</p>
<p>When we arrived at Haiyan, we saw that a large section of the stone Tang had collapsed. Sun Shoupei said: "It collapsed more than 100 years ago." Probably the Qiantang River's water flow changed its course, just like the angry waves from the Six Harmonies Pagoda to the Houchaomen during the Qian Wei era, changing to the situation of Qibao to Shibao.</p>
<p>Major Engineering</p>
<p>Arriving at Haiyan City, the large houses in the city are now only ruins and broken walls. They stand in the desolate grass, feeling desolate and lonely. I wonder when they will be able to recover!</p>
<p>In the afternoon, some people went to Zhapu. Zhapu is very good, and there is no serious danger in Tang construction.</p>
<p>The reporter seized an opportunity to talk to Shao Fuwu on a building first about the problem of managing the seawall. Shao said, "This is like treating a disease. The doctor is unwilling to make a judgment lightly or prescribe medicine before fully understanding the pathology. Managing the sea and the river are all about managing water. The stone Tang in Haiyan is managing the sea, and the one in Haining is managing the river. The phenomenon today is that Haining is more difficult than Haiyan, and managing the river is not as easy as managing the sea. The most serious thing is that the mud and water behind Tang are connected to the river in front of Tang, which easily drags down the stone Tang."</p>
<p>Mao Yisheng, with his bright eyes, seemed to see the seawall in front of him. He pondered for a while, and then said: "The object of civil engineering is gold, wood, water, fire, and earth. Take the Qiantang River Bridge, look at the 'Qian' next to the gold, the 'Tang' next to the earth, the 'Jiang' next to the water, and the 'Bridge' next to the wood. Finally, we destroyed the bombs and blew them up, isn't it fire?" We laughed. He continued: "After watching the Qiantang River Seawall, we should have some thoughts: First, the predecessors did their best. This can be seen in such a major project. Second, they put in a lot of thought. The Qiantang River Seawall is a three-dimensional building. Stone bars are stacked one by one, and piles are driven under the stone bars. Tan Shui is made in front of the stone Tang. These are all to make the Tang construction strong. Third, it seems to have a scientific basis. We see that the seawall is a curved wave-shaped building, which is used to prevent the impact of rapid tides. This is more reasonable. Reasonableness is science. The predecessors did their best and put in a lot of thought, but the stone Tang has to be repaired every year and cannot achieve the goal. What's the reason? Because the predecessors only paid attention to the solidity of the stone Tang, but neglected the forces outside the stone Tang. What are the forces? That is water, soil, and wind. The soil of the Qiantang River has the property of quicksand. The quicksand soil is easily washed away. First, the Qiantang River's water flow changes with time, which can wash away the mud near Tan Shui, affecting the Tang base. Second, the ebb tide can take the mud away. Third, the rainwater intrusion behind Tang, coupled with the impact of the river, can cause the entire stone Tang to slip. The erosion of the Qiantang River is really great. It can deepen the riverbed by 25 feet in 24 hours, that is, there is also erosion around a wooden pile. The wooden piles under the Qiantang River Seawall may also be eaten by wood-boring insects. If the wooden pile head is above the low water level, sometimes it is in the water and sometimes it is out of the water, which is also easy to break. For the present plan, protecting the collapse is more important than repairing the Tang, and managing the river is more important than protecting the collapse. Managing the river must stabilize the riverbed, so that the runaway river water returns to the slot. It is best to make the river narrow and deep, so that navigation can be carried out on the river, and land can be left on both sides for reclamation, and dams can be built upstream to generate electricity together with the tide. The electricity can be supplied to Shanghai. Therefore, the management of the Qiantang River must use the characteristics of the Qiantang River, and guide it according to the situation, which will surely achieve twice the result with half the effort."</p>
<p>The Effect of Erosion</p>
<p>Mao repeatedly explained that the erosion of the Qiantang River is great, the water flow is rapid, and there is a tide head. He said: "The flow rate of the Qiantang River is 15,000 cubic meters per second, and the flow velocity is 2.5 meters per second. Now, to manage the Qiantang River, we must collect data, do more experiments, and think of clever methods based on scientific principles to overcome rigidity with softness.</p>
<p>"Everything can be used. If we can use the characteristics, it will be beneficial. If we cannot use it, it will become a disaster."</p>
<p>He also praised that ancient Chinese water conservancy projects are better than any country in the world. First, he knows to base on the principles of water. Second, he can use local materials. Third, he pays attention to long-term maintenance. He said that the Dujiangyan in Guanxian, Sichuan, was completed at a time when foreign water conservancy projects were still unknown.</p>
<p>We stayed in Haining for one night. On the third day, we took a boat to Jiaxing. At the Yanyu Tower in Nanhu, Jiaxing, the reporter said to Mao and others: "Qian Wei's construction of the Qiantang River has won the respect of the world. This time, Mr. Mao and others have managed the Qiantang River well. Mr. Mao and others are Qian 　 the second," Mao grabbed my hand and said, "Don't exaggerate too much."</p>
<p>Because I was eager to go to Hangzhou, Tang Zhenxu told me at the time of parting: "We are scheduled to study and design for eight, nine, and thirteen months, and start construction in November. We want to take a year to repair the collapsed stone Tang as much as possible, which is about six kilometers long. Each kilometer requires 400,000 yuan."</p>
<p>Mao said to the reporter: "Please go back and tell the compatriots of Zhejiang that the greatest responsibility of the people of Zhejiang is to manage the Qiantang River!"</p>
<p>In the reluctance of parting and infinite expectation, I left them.</p>

<h3>A Corner of Lushan</h3>
<p>— Special Reporter Xie Baozhu, Kuling Aviation Dispatch from Our Newspaper, 9th</p>
<p>The garden of the chairman's summer residence in Lushan was greatly damaged by the enemy in the nine years. Recently, Mrs. Chiang Kai-shek specially invited the Englishman Kyle, a garden consultant who designed the garden of the Shanghai residence, to come to the mountain to arrange it. Kyle has already drawn up the drawings and plans to set up a bread oven in a corner of the garden, and place stone tables and chairs in the middle of the garden. In this way, bread can be baked and eaten when dining in the garden.</p>
<p>Switzerland is the international summer capital, and Lushan is the Switzerland of China. Although there are only 53 foreigners in Lushan as of August 8 (excluding the US military personnel who come and go indefinitely), there are eight nationalities, including seven Americans, eleven British, three Russians, eleven Germans, two French, fifteen Swedes, two Swiss, two Irish, and one Polish.</p>
<p>Among the 53 foreigners, there are 23 men, 24 women, 2 boys, and 4 girls. The average age is 45. The most common occupation of these people is preachers. There are 29 male and female missionaries, two Swiss watchmakers, three doctors, two businessmen, two teachers, one German consultant of the Salt Affairs Bureau of the Ministry of Finance, and one French lady working here for the Relief Agency.</p>
<p>Among the 24 ladies, there is one British woman, 51 years old, whose husband is from Anhui, China.</p>
<p>A White Russian couple came to the mountain from Hankou on the 13th of last month to escape the summer heat and lived on the upper floor of a department store opened by a friend on Zhen Street. The couple opened a wood business in Hankou, but the business was not very good, so they closed down. After coming to the mountain this time, they felt that there was nothing to do. The Russian gentleman said, "Crimea is much more beautiful than here, but it is not as cool as here." The wife felt that living in Kuling was too inconvenient and said, "If Hankou writes to say that it is not too hot, we will go back." The Russian couple had originally prepared to stay at the Xianyuan Hotel, "but it is really too expensive," they said.</p>
<p>There is a tower-shaped building on the summit of Kuling Mountain, which everyone thought was a water tower. After several reporters observed it on the spot, they learned that it was the former Japanese military observation tower. The tower is about 40 feet high, with a small house next to it for accommodation. There is also an ancient bronze bell, supported by three giant trees. One tree is engraved with the words "Mountains are high and water is long", and the other tree has the words "Showa 14th year". It is said that the enemy was afraid of attacks by our guerrillas and also afraid of bombing by our air force, so they were very diligent in observation and would ring the bell to warn if there was any abnormal movement.</p>
<p>The hotel fees in Kuling are as high as 50,000 yuan a day (excluding meals), but there are also cheaper ones. There is a medium-sized hotel with 70,000 yuan per room per season. The room can also accommodate three beds, which adds up to only 260 yuan per person per day.</p>
<h3>Controlling Japan - Information from This Newspaper's Archives</h3>
<p>Recently, experts from the U.S. State Department and the British Foreign Office have drafted a peace treaty with Japan, which has garnered much attention. How Japan is reformed to maintain peace in the Far East will depend on how this treaty is drafted. The UK and the US are busy dealing with European issues, and the peace treaty with Japan has not yet been publicly released. However, the work carried out by the Far Eastern Commission and the Allied Council for Japan over the past year reveals the attitudes of various countries toward the peace treaty with Japan.</p>
<p>Since the Japanese military's surprise attack on Pearl Harbor on December 8, 1941, the war in the Pacific, apart from China's consistent involvement, only included the United States. Britain adhered to the "Europe First" principle, and the Soviet Union had deployed a large number of troops to fight against Germany. Therefore, it could only maintain neutrality towards Japan until April 5, 1945, when it announced the termination of the Soviet-Japanese Neutrality Pact. By this time, the situation in the Pacific had changed significantly. On August 8, the Soviet Union formally declared war on Japan, but three days prior, the United States had dropped an atomic bomb on Hiroshima, threatening Japan into submission. Therefore, after Japan signed the surrender, the initial occupation work was handled by General MacArthur, which inevitably caused misunderstandings among other countries.</p>
<p>During the London Five-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference, the Soviet Union proposed the issue of joint control of Japan. The United States believed that it was not within the scope of the Berlin Conference and refused to discuss it. On October 23, after three weeks of meetings of the Far Eastern Advisory Commission, a preliminary agreement was reached, and it was decided to send representatives to investigate various parts of Japan to determine policies towards Japan. The delegation arrived in Japan in mid-January and returned to their countries in mid-February.</p>
<p>In December 1945, the Moscow Three-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference again discussed the issue of joint control of Japan. The United States, fearing a repeat of the Berlin Four-Power Control Council, advocated cautious consideration. After repeated consultations, the United States made concessions to reach a solution, which was to reorganize the Far Eastern Advisory Commission into the Far Eastern Commission. In addition to the original ten participating countries—China, the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, the Netherlands, the Philippines, and India—the Soviet Union also participated. At the same time, an Allied Council for Japan was established, with the participation of joint representatives from China, the United States, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, and India, chaired by General MacArthur. The Far Eastern Commission is the highest guiding body for the control of Japan. All major policies can be discussed and decided, and any instructions and measures of the Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers can be reviewed, but it has no executive or direct veto power. The Allied Council for Japan discusses and advises the Supreme Commander on the implementation of the terms of Japan's surrender. Its powers are defined as follows:</p>
<p>1.  The Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers shall consult with the Council before issuing major orders. His decisions on these matters are binding.</p>
<p>2.  Regarding the implementation of the Far Eastern Commission's policies, such as the reorganization of the control agencies, or the fundamental or major reorganization of Japanese political parties and the government, if one member of the Commission disagrees with the Supreme Commander, the Supreme Commander shall postpone issuing orders on these issues until the Far Eastern Commission has reached an agreement on the matter.</p>
<p>3.  If the situation requires, the Supreme Commander, after preliminary consultation with other Allied representatives on the Allied Council, may make changes to a certain minister of the Japanese government or appoint a person to fill a vacancy caused by the resignation of a cabinet member.</p>
<p>The Far Eastern Commission opened in Washington, D.C., on February 26, 1946, at the former Japanese embassy. In addition to the permanent chairman, the U.S. representative McCoy, the Chinese Ambassador to the U.S., Wei Daoming, the British Ambassador to the U.S., Halifax, and the Soviet Ambassador to the U.S., Gromyko, were appointed as vice-chairmen. The Commission established six subcommittees: (1) War Crimes Committee, chaired by China's representative Xia Jinlin. (2) Reparations Committee, chaired by Australia's representative Eggleston. (3) Economic and Financial Committee, chaired by Britain's representative Sansom. (4) Constitutional and Judicial Reform Committee, chaired by India's representative Babai. (5) Committee to Strengthen Democratic Tendencies, chaired by the Soviet Union's representative Novikov, with China's representative Ma Tian serving as vice-chairman. (6) Foreign Residents in Japan Committee, chaired by France's representative Lacoste. Later, a Committee for Disarmament of Japan was established. On April 5, the Allied Council for Japan was established in Tokyo.</p>
<p>On July 26, 1945, the United States drafted a Four-Power Treaty on the Disarmament of Japan for Twenty-Five Years, aiming for a century of peace in the Far East. The main points are summarized as follows: (1) Establish a Four-Power Control Council to supervise Japan's disarmament and non-fortification of its territory; (2) Disarm all of Japan's army, navy, and air force, dissolve the Imperial General Headquarters and the General Staff, prohibit the establishment of military and semi-military organizations, ban the manufacture and import of weapons, and prohibit the establishment of naval and air bases; (3) If Japan takes any action that violates this treaty, the signatory countries must take necessary actions in the air, land and sea to stop it, but the measures taken must be reported to the United Nations Security Council; (4) The treaty is valid for a period of twenty-five years, and a Four-Power conference should be convened within six months before the expiration of the treaty to determine whether the treaty needs to be amended or extended. After notifying the governments of China, the United Kingdom, and the Soviet Union, China and the United Kingdom generally expressed their approval in principle, but the Soviet Union considered this to be a step backward.</p>
<p>General MacArthur has repeatedly stated that Japan should be democratized, draft a new constitution, organize political parties, and prepare for general elections. New political parties have emerged one after another, among which the Liberal Party and the Progressive Party, representing the conservatives, and the Socialist Party, representing the left wing, are the most powerful. The new constitution was completed on March 6 after several twists and turns.</p>
<p>After the popular elections, the work of handling Japan should enter the second stage, planning for economic self-sufficiency, reforming the rural land system, reforming social organizations, and implementing democratic education. After the war, Japan's agricultural production decreased, factories shut down, and there was extreme food and economic panic. The United States decided to ship grain to Japan, which was met with dissatisfaction from various countries. The Far Eastern Commission asked it to reconsider, but the plan for Japan's economic self-sufficiency has been approved, using a portion of its exports to exchange for foreign exchange to purchase agricultural tools, fertilizers, and various raw materials. The reform of the land system is mainly aimed at supporting self-cultivating farmers; the land owned by large landlords should be divided among the farmers.</p>
<p>The issue of reparations related to the control of Japan is also quite complicated. The United States sent a reparations representative, Pauley, to China, Japan, and Korea to conduct investigations to formulate a reparations policy. General MacArthur submitted a catalog of all Japanese industrial assets to Pauley. However, the United States stated that the purpose of reparations is to eliminate Japan's potential for war, and Japanese factory equipment should be transferred to Pacific countries as reparations. However, it allowed Japan to retain a portion of its light industry, such as textiles, to meet the needs of economic recovery. More than 400 factories have been designated for dismantling and shipping. China fought against Japan for eight years, and the areas destroyed were the widest, and the losses suffered were the most severe. Therefore, it should enjoy preferential rights in the distribution of reparations. It has drafted a plan and sent it to the Reparations Committee. Pauley also said that China should enjoy more reparations. Although some factories have been dismantled and shipped, the entire reparations plan and distribution are yet to be determined. Regarding Japanese territory, in addition to allowing it to retain its four main islands and their attached small islands, the southern part of Sakhalin Island and the Kuril Islands were ceded to the Soviet Union in the Yalta secret agreement. Taiwan was returned to China, and Korea was granted independence. The remaining islands in the Pacific, which are under trusteeship, are currently occupied by the U.S. military. The United States intends to retain the islands to gain naval control over the Pacific. However, according to the United Nations Charter, there is no obligation for the United States to be the trustee of the three groups of islands, but there is also no prohibition on U.S. control. Theoretically, under the leadership of the United States, promoting world peace, it seems appropriate to rule these three small groups of islands, but it is not known whether there will be opponents in the future.</p>
<p>The work of controlling Japan carried out under General MacArthur's leadership has been carried out separately, leading Japan onto a new path, but Japan's potential for war has not been eliminated. Are the so-called new political parties, the most powerful Liberal Party and Progressive Party, not incarnations of the Minseito and Seiyukai parties? The dissolution of the Zaibatsu groups is just breaking them up into smaller units, and their power has not been reduced. The Japanese cabinets, from Prince Higashikuni to Shidehara to Yoshida, are all figures who were attached to the military cliques in the past. The recent Shibuya incident shows that their hearts have not been completely tamed. The discovery of a large amount of gold and silver at the bottom of Tokyo Bay further reveals their intention to make a comeback. However, the United States still maintains an attitude of generosity, such as allowing the Japanese to go to sea to fish and helping them restore their industry, which not only affects China's construction but can also become the foundation for Japan's revival. Which is more dangerous? Therefore, the control of Japan must be strict in the future, and the methods must be thorough. All of Japan's potential for war must be completely eradicated, and all factors that can initiate war should also be eliminated. It is imperative to ensure that the power of Japanese militarists is eliminated, so that peace in the Far East can be hoped for.</p>

<h3>Poor Water Flow from Tap Water</h3>
<p>Editor: My family says that tap water and electricity were severely restricted before the victory, which was very inconvenient, but there was no way to complain. After the victory, the use of electricity has become much more convenient, but the tap water is still like a "DDT" drip. I wonder if the Bureau of Public Works or the Bureau of Public Utilities can explain the reason for the insufficient flow rate or pressure of the tap water. If they know the reason, can they improve it to benefit the citizens? (Wang Wentao)</p>
<h3>Playing with Matches is Dangerous</h3>
<p>Editor: Recently, vendors on various streets in this city have been selling a newly invented type of match. Each set contains twelve matches. These matches can be lit anywhere with a single strike, even on smooth surfaces like glass. Many ignorant children are vying to buy them and randomly strike them for fun. If this continues, it will be extremely dangerous for the safety of citizens. I hope that vendors will refuse to sell them to young children, and I hope that parents will pay attention to supervising and prohibiting their children at all times to prevent accidents. (Wu Xiaobo)</p>
<p>Reply to Mr. Liu Zhiguang: Your letter regarding chicken and duck cages in the chicken and duck shops on Ningbo Road obstructing pedestrians and the failure to remove excrement has been forwarded to the Municipal Health Bureau. According to the reply, the bureau has ordered its staff to conduct a secret investigation to verify the facts for verification and handling.</p>

<h3>Answering Readers - Legal Questions</h3>
<p>(1) Hua Jingwen asks: In 1937, I mortgaged three houses to a certain person, A, for 3,000 legal tender (fapi) with a term of fifteen years, stating that a relocation fee of 200 yuan should be compensated for taking them back within the term. In 1944, I further mortgaged them for 100,000 yuan of puppet currency (伪币). Also, in 1941, I borrowed 3,000 yuan of legal tender from A and signed a mortgage agreement and a loan agreement. Now, due to financial difficulties, I intend to sell the houses to cover my expenses. I offered A 6,700 yuan of legal tender to redeem the houses, but A actually sent a lawyer's letter stating: "According to Article 12 of the Supplementary Regulations on Handling Civil Lawsuits After Recovery, the method of redemption should be fairly measured to increase or decrease the payment. The minimum amount for redeeming the houses is 16 million yuan." I am extremely perplexed. According to the Ministry of Finance's current regulations for banks, pre-war legal tender deposits and debts are all repaid in the original amount of legal tender. Why must private debts between individuals be increased or decreased? Is A's demand of 16 million yuan legal? How should a fair method be handled? I hope your lawyer can clarify this in detail.</p>
<p>[Lawyer Duanmu Kai replies] The creditor may request to handle it in accordance with Article 12 of the Supplementary Regulations on Handling Civil Lawsuits After Recovery. However, the amount of payment should be fairly determined by the court.</p>
<p>(2) Zhang Hongfang asks: In the summer of 1941, my uncle remitted 300,000 yuan of legal tender from Siam to purchase medicinal herbs from a certain Chinese medicine store in Shanghai to be shipped to Siam for sale. After the outbreak of the Pacific War, transportation was blocked, communication was interrupted, and the transaction ceased. After the victory, the medicine store continues to operate as usual. Now, they have three requests: (1) Take the medicinal herbs or cash according to the value at that time, (2) Refund the money according to the price of rice at that time, (3) Calculate interest on the principal at the interest rate of ordinary merchants, with compound interest. Are the above requests legal? If the other party is unwilling to fulfill them, what method should be used to deal with them?</p>
<p>[Lawyer Duanmu Kai replies] It can be handled in accordance with Article 12 of the Supplementary Regulations on Handling Civil Lawsuits After Recovery.</p>

<h3>Chinese Hermits and Chinese Culture</h3>
<p>— Shui Zhou</p>
<p>Written by Jiang Xingyu, Published by Zhonghua Book Company</p>
<p>During the War of Resistance Against Japan, books like "Chinese Hermits and Chinese Culture" were indeed rare; however, I finally discovered it in the 1943 catalog of the Chongqing edition of Zhonghua Book Company.</p>
<p>Because I have been collecting idle books such as "Anthology of Hermit Tales," "Minor Hermit Books," and "Biographies of Lofty Scholars" for several years, and at the same time, I feel that if I want to study Chinese culture and understand the whole picture of Chinese literati and scholars from the bottom of my heart, it is necessary to conduct a summary study of the ideology of hermits. Therefore, when I saw this book, I paid very close attention to it, and it was only today that I had the opportunity to read it carefully, which is truly unspeakably pleasant.</p>
<p>The author divides this topic into ten chapters for discussion. Among them, the third and sixth chapters have many unique insights, the seventh chapter, the statistics on the regional distribution of hermits, can be described as painstaking and interesting. The eighth and ninth chapters have very insightful observations. Now, I will describe them separately.</p>
<p>First, listing the various different names of hermits found in the classics to define their scope and rectify their names. This chapter is handled a bit too redundantly. I think it is only necessary to list the various different names and their definitions, and add a conclusion, and it is not necessary to establish a separate chapter.</p>
<p>Second, examining the factors that led to the formation of hermits. The author analyzes them into two aspects: subjective factors and objective factors. Subjective factors are further divided into individualism and non-cooperationism, and objective factors are also divided into two. One is that the traditional philosophy of escape has penetrated the scholar-official class. The second is that Chinese society is an agricultural society. The analysis is very pertinent.</p>
<p>Third, distinguishing the types of Chinese hermits. I think this chapter is the most rigorous. However, it seems that there is still room for discussion on whether Boyi is a hypocritical hermit.</p>
<p>The fourth and fifth chapters describe the political and economic lives of hermits. After his comprehensive description, we have a clearer understanding of the psychological phenomena of hermits.</p>
<p>The sixth chapter describes the social life of hermits. Its conclusion is: "Chinese society has been poisoned by the aloof self-admiration of hermits, so people go their own way, suffering cannot be shared, and happiness cannot be shared. This is something that deserves our serious reflection." It is very pertinent.</p>
<p>The seventh chapter statistics the regional distribution of hermits. This is the most brilliant chapter in the whole book. Although he only uses famous mountains as the warp and makes regional statistics of hermits in various dynasties, it seems not accurate enough; but this is ultimately an original creation and is very valuable.</p>
<p>The eighth and ninth chapters describe the relationship between hermits and painting and poetry. Here, I am amazed at the author's erudition and discernment. These two chapters can simply be seen as a history of landscape painting and pastoral poetry. The writing is also particularly fresh and refreshing.</p>
<p>The tenth chapter describes how Chinese scholars criticize Chinese hermits. And finally, the author "loudly calls out": "Live bravely and do not be a hermit." It shows the author's positive attitude. The whole book is roughly like this.</p>
<p>Regarding the evaluation of hermits, my personal views are somewhat different from the author's. The ancients said, "Everyone has their own ambitions." Why are there so many different "ambitions"? Because bodies are strong or weak, blood types are different, heredity has an influence, and the differences in social and family environment and the quality of education all affect a person's "ambition". Those with "talent" do not necessarily have the "ambition". For example, Zhuge Liang has the talent of a wise minister, but before he met the Lord of Shu, he was "willing to plow the fields to maintain his ambition", which is the authentic way of hermits. Tao Yuanming's "Returning Home, Oh Return" says: "Since I have enslaved my mind to external things, why should I be sad and grieve alone?" "Mind" is "ambition", so hermits are people who use their minds to control their bodies. Unless they are forced to, they are unwilling to "lower their minds to follow others", which is the so-called "nature of a deer". But if the country is in danger, they should also "not give way to benevolence". All true hermits are like this. The author's examples of Lü Shang, Yi Yin, legends, and Boyi, Ji Kang, and Tao Hongjing are actually, in my opinion, no different.</p>
<p>In short, this is a rare good book, although some parts are still not precise enough.</p>
<h3>Marx's Political Thought</h3>
<p>— Jun Zhi</p>
<p>Author: Wu Enyu</p>
<p>Publisher: Commercial Press</p>
<p>The era is constantly advancing, and the thoughts of young people are advancing with it. Modern young people, in addition to reading some literary books, also pay attention to books on politics, economics, and science that are closely related to them.</p>
<p>Indeed, in this era of constant change, young people have to read some new science books to understand this world and deeply realize how they should strive for the motherland in the future!</p>
<p>Now, I am here to introduce to you a book worth reading. That is Wu Enyu's "Marx's Political Thought."</p>
<p>Our view of Marx, as the author of this book says: neither takes an emotional attitude of approval, nor an emotional attitude of opposition, but only conducts purely academic research on his theories.</p>
<p>The author, Wu Enyu, studied in England and obtained a degree. The original was written in English, and later translated into this Chinese version with his wife, Ms. Song Shuqing. In this book, all of Marx's theories on methodology, philosophy, history, economics, politics, and ethics are analyzed, and the materials involved cover all of Marx's works throughout his life.</p>
<p>In the first chapter, "Method and Methodology," it tells us that the tools of the research method are induction, analysis, comparison, observation, and experimentation; the "true life" of the research object, after being "depicted," no matter how successful the depiction, cannot but lose its "vividness."</p>
<p>Marx believed that the following three items are the main tools in the study of social phenomena: (1) "analysis" of facts or the use of "abstract ability"; (2) "facing facts" and "comparing facts"; (3) the method of seeking the historical and economic motives of the social superstructure. He explained these three tools separately.</p>
<p>He also clarified the philosophical schools of Marx and Hegel, and gave a detailed explanation of formal logic.</p>
<p>In the second and third chapters, he explained the characteristics of Marx's philosophy; the arguments against metaphysics, the scope of application of Marx's philosophy, and the meaning of "materialism," and the textual research and explanation of historical materialism.</p>
<p>In the fourth chapter, "Elucidation of the Theory of Revolution," he describes the revolution, law, and practical needs, the unity of revolutionary theory and revolutionary practice, and the theory of proletarian revolution; these are all explained concisely and clearly.</p>
<p>The fifth chapter is Marx's evaluation of Kant and Bentham. Regarding the evaluation of Kant's theory, there are two steps: (1) a brief description of Kant's ethics and political theory, (2) Marx's criticism.</p>
<p>Regarding Bentham's utilitarian theory, it is also divided into two steps: (1) the general nature of Bentham's utilitarian theory; (2) Marx's criticism of this theory.</p>
<p>The last chapter is "On Morality and Human Nature"; first, morality, efficiency, and internal necessity, and the ethical relations and ethical analysis in capitalist society. Characteristics, at the same time, the different points, and even the contradictory explanations, of the concepts of good, evil, right, and wrong are explained.</p>
<p>Finally, he made a comparative description of the theories of human nature of Spinoza, Rousseau, Bentham, Kant, and Marx.</p>
<p>The whole book is divided into six chapters, which describe Marx's thoughts in detail, and are not limited to "politics."</p>
<p>Of course, I can only give a brief introduction to it, and cannot elaborate further. If you want to see all of Marx's academic thoughts, this book is a very good one.</p>
<p>Studying Marx's theories is a relatively popular thing among modern young people. It's just that some gentlemen who call themselves guiding ideologies regard Marx's theories as objects of faith. Therefore, they only promote doctrines, not study academics. Mr. Wu's book can be used as a good example for studying Marx's theory. It only contains calm research and citations from classics, and no slogans or propaganda clichés. Secondly, recently, people who generally study Marx's theory seem to disdain reading other books besides those about Marx. Mr. Wu's study of Marx's theory has its own complete philosophical foundation. He studies Marx from the theories of various schools. This is the way to do scholarship. Finally, there is another advantage of this book: it avoids the general habit of those who study Marx of being vague and ambiguous. The author gives precise analysis and detailed explanations of several important terms in Marx's theory, such as "production method," "lower base," superstructure," "decision," and "necessarily." Although we do not necessarily fully accept the author's conclusions, his research method is worth learning from readers.</p>
<p>I will not say more. I hope that in addition to reading literary works, you will also read political and economic books that are very beneficial to yourselves, and take pure objectivity and research as the principle to read all these beneficial books, in order to create truly new Chinese youths and move forward together on the road to creating a new China!</p>
<h3>"I Chose Freedom"</h3>
<p>— Hua</p>
<p>Written by Victor Kravchenko, published in New York</p>
<p>Victor Kravchenko ∶ "I Chose Freedom"</p>
<p>Charles Scriber’s Sons, 1946</p>
<p>This is a very interesting autobiography. The author was originally a Soviet official. In this book, he honestly wrote down his life before going abroad, his experience serving the party, and the origin of the change in his thinking after being sent to the United States.</p>
<p>On April 4, 1944, Victor Kravchenko suddenly defected from the Soviet Purchasing Commission in Washington. At that time, newspapers all over the United States published this news, which caused a sensation.</p>
<p>In his postscript, he said: "After he defected from the Purchasing Commission, he risked his life to write this book. He fled from this dormitory to that dormitory, from this city to that city, hiding his name and avoiding people's attention."</p>
<p>He explained that "the reason for his defection was by no means accidental, but the result of long-term consideration."</p>
<p>He also said: "When I defected from the Purchasing Commission, the war was still going on. The Western democracies had to cooperate with our country. I could only try my best to restrain myself. The common victory should be more important than anything else, and I was willing to keep silent. But now that victory has been achieved, I might as well write it down in detail, frankly, and realistically for people to see. And this is also my responsibility."</p>
<p>"The people in our country cannot tell people their opinions, their hopes, and their sufferings. Therefore, I want to expose everything and warn people not to deceive themselves anymore."</p>
<p>"In our country, there is not even the slightest minimum of economic and political freedom, but people are asked to believe that there is also a kind of so-called 'freedom' and so-called 'democracy' in our organization, which seems to be a little different from 'old-fashioned' democracy."</p>
<p>He was born in Yekaterinoslav, Ukraine, in 1905, and grew up in an atmosphere of opposition to the empire since he was a child; his father was a revolutionary. In 1917, he had seen the very chaotic situation, the hard life, and the serious civil war. He did not formally join the party until 1929.</p>
<p>He is a metallurgical technician and is very enthusiastic about the work of the party. He said that his faith began to waver during the "collectivization," and then came a great famine. He was not the only one who began to doubt in his heart. When World War II began, he served as an engineer in the Red Army, and then worked for the People's Committee, and was finally sent to the United States.</p>
<p>He is a patriot. The question he raises is a question worth considering.</p>
<p>The original book was written in Russian, and the English version has been personally reviewed by him.</p>
<h3>Stories of the Steppe</h3>
<p>— Written by Gorky, translated by Ba Jin, Ai Jia</p>
<p>In his translation of "Stories of the Steppe," Ba Jin mentioned what H.T. Schnitkind said: "The greatest and most durable thing in the world is the achievement of the hands of dreamers. Those who act without dreaming are the destroyers of the world: they are like Attila; these barbaric forces, to leave traces on the sands of time, must first soak the sands of time with human blood. Only those who are good at dreaming like Gorky and Tolstoy can build a fairy tale from the materials of the ocean and the land, and create a land of free men from the chaos of autocracy and suffering."</p>
<p>Gorky (Maxim Gorky), this great dreamer, wrote three novel and powerful fairy tales in his "Stories of the Steppe": (1) Makar Chudra (2) Because of Monotony (3) The Man Who Cannot Die.</p>
<p>According to the naming of "Stories of the Steppe," it is easy to associate with many beautiful scenes: in a very far away place, on a primitive and empty wilderness, fragrant green grass grows everywhere, and rivers and streams flow slowly around it. The people who live here should always be happy. They work and rest every day, with smiles after hard work, looking at their homes shining in the sun; their cattle and sheep lower their heads and graze silently in the nearby area... Everything on the prairie should be so beautiful and gentle; life is full of tranquility. But Gorky does not allow us to imagine it so beautiful. He brought a bleak cold wind from the distant plains; in the darkness, the sea whispered softly; and those dreams and facts that can be sung and cried; yes, on this vast and boundless prairie; a young Gypsy couple died for the sake of their inherent self-esteem and freedom. Zobar killed the girl he loved; her father stabbed him to death; "Nada" in "Makar Chudra" thus "held a strand of her free black hair, her dull and dull eyes wide open, looking at the sky, under her feet, lay Zobar's beautiful body, his hair covering his face"; the most precious fresh blood; stained the prairie. In addition, "Because of Monotony," a group of lonely people could not bear the silence of the wilderness, so they wanted to find stimulation and happiness from others; they committed crimes; the poor and ugly cook Alina finally killed herself, and that defiled body was buried in the prairie... Also, that "Man Who Cannot Die" called "Larna" was punished for being "forever alive" because of his conceit and pride, "He has no companions, and wanders alone in the places where people live for thousands of years." The cruel torture of "immortality" turned him into a trembling shadow, wandering on the prairie - until the eternal future.</p>
<p>Gorky is a great dreamer. He had already woven the dream of the steppe before you knew it. His love and hate, his thoughts and philosophy, his yearning, his prayer for everything, his joy and sorrow; here, played a melancholy and meaningful heart song; he said: "All this (on the steppe) - fragrance, clouds, stars, people - in this fragrant, golden twilight, shines with a charming beauty; but there is an indescribable, sad atmosphere shrouded in everything, as if in the opening scene of a fairy tale. Everything is alive and harmonious and beautiful; but at the same time it seems that the hand of death is about to grab them, as if their brilliant growth will suddenly stop, this life lacks the active activities of real life; it does not have those sounds with latent growth. But the sounds sent to my ears at this time have been weak and intermittent, and when they slowly pass away, they seem to have turned into soft sighs - sighs of regret and yearning. What are they yearning for? Maybe it's happiness - that elusive, unknowable mirage, the happiness of the world? ... When these tones were floating in the air, I was filled with whimsical desires. I wish I could turn into dust, so that I could be blown away by the wind in all directions. I would very much like to be like a warm stream of water, pouring into the sea, and then turning into water vapor and flying into the beautiful clouds. I wish I, and only I, could penetrate the entire sad, magical night. I am very melancholy at this time, and I don't know why. …"</p>
<p>Life needs passion, dreams, and strong love and hate; in the narrow cages of the city, people's hearts are weighed down by yearning. What they can hear, see, and touch is a simple dynamic of life. Why don't they expect to look at the place outside the iron railing with green fields; where, there are also old people using a sad and instructive tone to recall those moving stories from the past.</p>

<h3>An Argentine Writer Who Speaks French</h3>
<p>— Dachun</p>
<p>If you want to find a representative of the French soul in Spanish-speaking South America, then you must talk about Mrs. Victoria Ocampo. This female writer spent her early years in Paris, and she studied French in her childhood. Therefore, when she later wrote out her thoughts on paper flawlessly, those French words naturally poured out from her pen. However, the center of Mrs. Ocampo's spiritual activities is not in France, because she is ultimately from Argentina. Since she is from Argentina, she must speak to her compatriots who speak Spanish.</p>
<p>The reviews, essays, etc. written by Mrs. Ocampo were initially written in French, and then carefully translated into clear Castilian, and only then could they be published in her own country in this way. Only one book was first published in Spanish and then in French. Regarding this matter, the author confessed in the essay collection French Conversations (Paroles for—angaise).</p>
<p>Mrs. Ocampo has written many articles in her homeland discussing French masters such as Mrs. Anna de Noailles, Proust, and Valers. Her book Evidence (Temoignages) is the fruit of meticulous research, describing three kinds of souls: French, English, and Spanish. Her important works include: Virginia Woolf, Orlando et Cie, Emily Brante, Sundays in Hyde Park (Dimanches a Hyde Park), Supremacy of Soul and Blood (Supremate de I＇ame et du sang), Women and Her Expressions (La femme et sonexpression) and From Francesca to Beatrice (De Francesca a Beatrice), etc.</p>
<p>Her hometown is Buenos Aires, where she founded a literary magazine called (Sur, the style is the same as the best magazines in Europe. The magazine regularly publishes works by European masters, including Valery, Claudel, Gide, Shaw, Huxley, Maranon, Ortegay Gasset, and Argentine writers such as Eduardo Mallea, Luis Alberto Erro, Bernardez, and OliverioGirondo).</p>
<p>Mrs. Ocampo was fascinated by literature when she was young. In that era, she once thought: "My only hope is that one day I will write, no matter whether I write well or not, because I am just a woman. I heard that a woman cannot express her thoughts and feelings in the same way as a man, and she will not speak in a man's voice." She was wrong. In contemporary Argentina, she has surpassed male writers. Her works are successful and international.</p>
<p>She goes to Paris almost every year to stay for a few times. During her guest days, she attends the meetings she wants to attend, visits several writers she admires, listens to music, or reads some books she likes.</p>
<p>Short Story</p>
<h3>September Clothes (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Su Ren</p>
<p>I held her warm hand tightly, unable to speak. My wife is really too good, and too pitiful. She has been married to me for almost a year, and I have not given her the best enjoyment. Even besides occasional items, I have not given her any jewelry, or made her a new dress. Only she often understands my thoughts and buys things I want to buy but have not bought without saying a word, whether it is a book or a handkerchief, it is all her own money. She has never asked me for a penny, and she often pays for the usual expenses, and refuses to tell me. She has a pure soul rarely found in women and a loyal and forgiving heart, a graceful appearance and a gentle personality. At this point, I think women are the greatest and most admirable things in the world, although there may be a few exceptions.</p>
<p>"What exactly is going on?" I finally spoke.</p>
<p>"It's nothing special. I made two sets of clothes for you, because I was afraid you would forget and wouldn't have any clothes to wear when it got cold."</p>
<p>Afraid I would forget? Am I really that confused? Could she be satirizing me?</p>
<p>"I didn't forget, but I failed, so I pretended I hadn't said this sentence, and hoped you would forget too, and let it pass like this. Now…"</p>
<p>"Okay, don't say anything. Do you and I need so many explanations for such a small matter?"</p>
<p>I nodded, she smiled and pulled me to sit down. We leaned together, without saying a word, letting our hearts confide in the silence instead.</p>
<p>After a long time, she asked me:</p>
<p>"What is that hard circle in your pocket?"</p>
<p>I suddenly remembered that this was a good opportunity for me to dedicate the bracelet to her, to repay her kindness for the clothes. I took it out and held it in my palm, holding it up to her eyes, and said with a smile:</p>
<p>"Especially for my wife, let it be paired with the original one. Take it out and see if it matches or not."</p>
<p>She left me, sat up, stared blankly, and said softly:</p>
<p>"I don't have one."</p>
<p>"I've seen it, it seems to be about the same."</p>
<p>"That's right, I had such a bracelet, but I sold it." I looked at her and listened carefully as she continued: "As for the money from the sale, it's these two sets of clothes."</p>
<p>"I should thank you even more. For my clothes, you sold your beloved thing."</p>
<p>"But how can I thank you, because you bought it back again."</p>
<p>"Is there such a thing, really?" I widened my eyes.</p>
<p>"Really, not at all wrong." She took the bracelet and stroked it: "I recognize every jade pattern, every trace of green, thank you. I, how much money did you spend?"</p>
<p>"Didn't spend a penny."</p>
<p>"Why?" She put the bracelet on her wrist and carefully looked at it.</p>
<p>"A friend gave it to me, saying it was as a gift for our future child."</p>
<p>"Ah, I was just about to tell you." She leaned close to my ear (actually there was no third person in the room). "Really, we're going to have a child soon!"</p>
<p>I jumped up with joy, pulled her, she winked at me, we embraced and danced with messy footsteps, dancing to every kind of tune, dancing all over every corner of the room, until both of our foreheads were a little wet, we stopped, and fell heavily on the bed. She was resting her head on the pillow, and I leaned on her chest:</p>
<p>"How many more months?"</p>
<p>"Next spring, I can be a father."</p>
<p>"Aren't you going to be a mother?"</p>
<p>After a long silence, I said:</p>
<p>"Things are really coincidental. Who would have thought that a friend would buy what you sold and give it to me, and I just happened to bring it back to give to you."</p>
<p>"It seems to be a cycle specially created by God to tease us ignorant fools, and it is watching and laughing from the side."</p>
<p>"Don't talk about those things," I raised my hand to hook her neck.</p>
<p>"You don't like my superstition, do you?"</p>
<p>"No, I think it's best for women to be more feminine, and superstition seems to be a female patent. As long as it's not too much, I like it. But you said humans are too pitiful. Although people say we are foolishly laughable, we can at least grasp our current lives, including joy and sorrow, and spend this life without selfishness or deception, and with a clear conscience."</p>
<p>She nodded, gently stroking my hair. I reached out and turned off the large light in the middle, and only the wall lamp emitted a faint crimson light. I looked up and saw her leaning down, so a little bit of coyness disappeared in a smile.</p>
<h3>Good and Pleasing to the Eye</h3>
<p>— Zhong Yuan</p>
<p>"Good" and "pleasing to the eye," looking at the literal meanings, seem like they shouldn't be very far apart. But in reality, "good" is one thing, and "pleasing to the eye" is another. Things that are "good" are not necessarily "pleasing to the eye," and things that are "pleasing to the eye" are not necessarily "good."</p>
<p>I bought a piece of printed artificial crepe fabric, and everyone praised it as pleasing to the eye, but then everyone also said, "It's only pleasing to the eye, once it's washed, it's finished!" I bought a piece of Wenzhou homespun cloth, and everyone praised it as sturdy, but then everyone also said, "It's sturdy, but it's just not very pleasing to the eye."</p>
<p>Things are like this, and isn't writing the same?</p>
<p>A few days ago, a friend told me something. She said she was reading a very famous Russian novel, because she had seen many articles in newspapers and magazines praising that novel beforehand. So, she specially cleared her schedule, planning to devote a week to that novel entirely, to enjoy a week in comfort. Unexpectedly, on the first day, when she opened the book, after reading just two pages, she felt a throbbing pain in her head. As a result, although she勉强勉强 finished the novel, it felt like enduring a week-long lawsuit.</p>
<p>This is indeed a tragedy. Many famous works by famous writers that have been heard of for a long time, many poems and novels with great significance, when you pick them up and read them, are not only obscure and tasteless, not at all pleasing to the eye, but sometimes, to put it bluntly, completely incomprehensible!</p>
<p>Of course, this is because the reader's level is too shallow to comprehend the profound meaning hidden behind the words by the author. However, I always believe that the function of writing is to make people understand, and the reason why writing is printed on paper is to be widespread. An article that is excessively profound can indeed win the praise of adults and gentlemen with deeper understanding, but aren't these kinds of adults and gentlemen ultimately in the minority?</p>
<p>"Good" things are not necessarily "pleasing to the eye," but I really hope that "good" articles can definitely be "pleasing to the eye"! Of course, the "pleasing to the eye" mentioned here refers to the article's form being "easy to read" and "engaging," and is not asking authors to use shallow content to cater to general low-level tastes.</p>
<h3>Summer</h3>
<p>— Engraved by Wu Junfa</p>
<h3>Home and Pastoral</h3>
<p>— Lu Qing</p>
<p>At night, I often feel lonely.</p>
<p>The lamp burns with a flame, but the flame is so dim it is like a withered flower; sometimes the wind blows, the lamplight trembles, and it seems like a girl's eye, blinking sadly with tears, looking at me with something to say, yet without a single word.</p>
<p>How can this give me warmth and comfort? In the realm of the deep night I mused -- home and pastoral, I was originally a cherished child...</p>
<p>Home? My home is beautiful! Let me sing you a song, a song of my homeland. My homeland, the place where I grew up, was originally a paradise.</p>
<p>There are clear rivers reflecting the weeping willows, there are dense pine forests embracing the small hills; in spring, the newly green grasslands are frequented by cattle and sheep, in autumn, the leaves are splendid and glorious.</p>
<p>On moonlit nights, we used to boat on the lake, and also several times near the ancient temple we reminisced beside the setting sun...</p>
<p>However, now I do not love to sing this song -- because the homeland I remember is indeed an even more beautiful place than this.</p>
<p>Blue lake waves, blue sky above the lake. When the crimson peach blossoms bloom in the willow thickets, under the peach trees, even more crimson wildflowers bloom with unspeakable names. Stars scatter in the summer evening sky, red small flowers scatter on the green grass of the lake embankment.</p>
<p>"Spiritual flowers bloom in the poet's pen," the poet originally is able to empathize with people's many deep sorrows, able to paint the contours of life. However, by the eternally tranquil lake, in the continuation of generations of life that never die; when seeing those beautiful colors and words that do not exist in the human world, thinking of the mysteries that transcend human thought, the poet should also weep in bewilderment at discovering his own ugliness.</p>
<p>The poet's pen will never be able to depict this painting of nature -- the boundless, profound sky, the boundless, profound lake; a cloud in the sky, a blade of grass on the ground, both contain boundless, profound mystery.</p>
<p>I should be so proud -- my homeland, the place where I grew up, and this place is supremely beautiful.</p>
<p>In the shadow of the setting sun, hurrying to the mountain peak to see the evening mist and twilight scenery. Or, rowing a boat to the center of the lake to wait for the moon to rise, using its silver light to paint a silver landscape for me.</p>
<p>Those days I was happy enough, but I was intoxicated in happiness, how often did I think of today's suffering; those days I sang all day long, letting joyful songs ripple on the lake surface, but I lived in a sweet dream, how often did I think that today I would sing in such a melancholic and disappointed low voice; those days I climbed the mountains, ran on the embankment, I was a mischievous child running tirelessly all day long, but after all, I was accustomed to running on level paths, with star-like flowers scattered on both sides, how often did I think that today, when I run tired, when my clothes are torn and my toes are bleeding, there is still an endless, thorny road in front of me.</p>
<p>Those days I did not understand why people sighed, and even more rarely did I think that today, I myself also sigh, constantly, my heart burning and aching...</p>
<p>Wandering, like a wisp of blue smoke, so lightly drifted out of my home.</p>
<p>Thus, on a road without end, I saw great wind and snow, saw death; I learned to sigh, and silently, silently think.</p>
<p>(Thinking of that distant place, thinking of those distant years).</p>
<p>Because what I can be proud of today is only the memory bag that has crossed thousands of mountains and rivers, but is still tightly carried on my back; what I can console myself with today is only the countless paintings and an epic of childhood that is forever sweet, treasured in this bag.</p>
<p>I also want to paint many more life contours, to re-pick the flowers and fruits of my youth, but the great wind and snow of a foreign land has repeatedly buried this weak life force of mine. Thus, I silently thought again --</p>
<p>Home and pastoral, I was originally a cherished child...</p>
<h3>An Inch of Land, an Inch of Blood</h3>
<p>— Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>Volume One, Seven Sealed Letters</p>
<p>These seven sealed letters concern the peace of the entire world, and the lives and property of countless millions of people. It is believed that there are very few people in the international community who can uncover these seven sealed letters, and perhaps only I am willing to do so. Uncovering them alone has no major significance; on the contrary, it may anger those active demonic stars and provoke them to do even more terrible and malicious things. Therefore, my current plan is, first, to try to obtain the contents of these seven sealed letters; second, to use all my power to thoroughly destroy the plans of the demons. If I cannot do this, then I can only take things as they come and do some remedial work. Comrade, work hard! 307</p>
<p>Chapter One: A Pair of Fresh Bloodshot Eyes</p>
<p>"Gu Jun: I have asked you twice, and you have not given me a definite answer. This letter is my last request. Whether it's favorable or unfavorable, you must give me a direction. The reports in the newspapers are so vague that the more I read them, the more confused I become. The editors of the newspapers in Beiping are too smooth and too diplomatic. But my intuition tells me that I smell a strong smell of gunpowder. This is not referring to the gunfire at Wanping and Lugou Bridge a few days ago; I am talking about the entire East, perhaps the entire world... I feel a kind of inexplicable excitement, and at the same time, I also feel an indescribable sorrow. Gu Jun, from the perspective of family relations, you know that I am a lone individual. From the perspective of society, I am a lonely person. I have also identified the enemy, seen the banner of my comrades' team, and know that a fierce and long-term struggle is about to begin, but you haven't given me a suitable opportunity or chosen a suitable position... Gu Jun, I appreciate your kindness in encouraging and guiding me on how to learn and improve. My studies can now be considered to have come to an end. I think you don't want to hear words of gratitude, and it's not that a little gratitude can end the relationship between us. Analyzing your various concerns for me over the years, I dare say that you must have a rather important goal (please forgive my excessive bluntness). From what I know about you, you must need many reliable assistants. But I have repeatedly requested, and you have always maintained an attitude of rejecting people from a thousand miles away. I have never been able to understand this. Gu Jun, I am asking you to give me a definite answer – note that this is my last request!..."</p>
<p>Seeing this, I put down the thick stack of letters and stared blankly at Hejian Yu, wanting to find a satisfactory answer from him for this letter-writing girl.</p>
<p>He was sitting opposite me, with a large square table between us. He held his face in both hands, his elbows resting on the table. His arms, with bulging muscles, protruding veins, and dense hair, and his handsome and elegant face, formed a very harmonious contrast. A small mustache was neatly trimmed on his upper lip, making him look even younger. His eyes were beautiful, yet coldly contained a hint of authority. When I looked up at him, he was also watching me, patiently waiting for my opinion.</p>
<p>"How is it?" His voice, though suppressed, was still extremely firm. "Keep reading."</p>
<p>"No, there are too many questions. I have to... I have to study the relationship between you two." I kept staring blankly at him.</p>
<p>He shook his head, looking somewhat impatient. He clenched his fists and tapped lightly on the table, then suddenly stood up and paced back and forth in the room.</p>
<p>It was almost time for the lights to come on. Our house was extremely secluded. The courtyard had a dozen rooms, inhabited by more than a dozen people, but there wasn't a sound. It was as quiet as an ancient temple in the deep mountains.</p>
<p>Originally, Changxindian was a semi-rural, semi-urban area. Fortunately, the general plant of the Pinghan Railway Communications Office was located here, and there was a small railway connecting to Fengtai. It even supported a small street with a small market. Those who depended on this small street and the iron factory for a living mostly lived on the street, but most of them lived scattered in the surrounding villages. Of course, the residents of these villages were all farmers.</p>

<p>The Reception and Investigation Team sent a letter to the military and police agencies requesting the detention of Wang Zhuchen. Five days have passed, and it has not yet been carried out.</p>

<p>From simple to complex, from straightforward to circuitous, utilizing people's psychology, thus the hostess system was born.</p>
<p>What does it matter to spend a couple of extra dollars for the lords and young masters to get what they want?</p>
<h3>The Artist's Hair</h3>
<p>— Zhang Shuyao</p>
<p>When I was nineteen, I was once passionately dreaming of becoming a poet. On one hand, I buried myself in writing poems about flowers and the moon behind closed doors. On the other hand, I actively grew my hair long, wanting to show the demeanor of a poet. But before my hair reached the back of my neck, my mother nagged me and forced me to cut it short. At that time, I didn't dare to hold my head high and declare that I was a poet, and all my complaints had to be suppressed in my stomach.</p>
<p>Later, I wandered to the rear, took off my long gown, put on a military uniform, and waded through mountains and rivers for several years. Then, I worked as a minor civil servant, plunging headfirst into the currents of life every day; but the dream of becoming a poet didn't diminish by a single point, but became even more passionate. But the hope of having long, fluffy hair had already been shattered. Probably because I was getting older, I had a different measure for viewing art. Besides, I remembered that Mr. Lu Xun had once scolded sham artists who wore red headbands, strange clothes, didn't shave for three months, and had long hair reaching their earlobes, which made me feel a little ashamed!</p>
<p>This time, when I returned to Shanghai, I was fortunate enough to meet a musician who was famous for a time in a certain city in the rear. The first time I shook hands, what caught my eye was a head of hair reaching his earlobes, two sideburns fluttering in the wind, and an unhealthy face, like the artist idol I worshiped when I was nineteen, standing vividly before my eyes. But, to be honest, the impression he gave me at the time was a bit tiresome. An artist with great talent suddenly seemed shorter to me!</p>
<p>Later, after getting to know him better, my mother, of course, couldn't stand this head of hair with its elegant style. She finally couldn't help but ask, "Why do you keep your hair so long? It's so annoying." He grinned, showing a row of neat teeth, narrowed his eyes, and replied with a smile, "Hehe, I'm an artist! Artists have this kind of hair!" The meaning in his Wu dialect was: You old woman don't know the greatness of art at all, you're making a fuss over nothing. Only artists should have this kind of hair, otherwise who would know I'm a musician! And he threw his eyes at me, wanting me to express my opinion. I hastily agreed, saying, "Yes, yes, artists all wear their hair like that!"</p>
<p>I believe that with such hot weather, wouldn't that gentleman feel cool and relaxed with such a large pile of hair pressing down on him? It's also a bit embarrassing to have his wife tirelessly wash his pillowcases because of the hair's pomade. Why not cut it shorter, which would be cooler and more convenient?</p>
<p>But why does this gentleman cherish his long, unattractive hair? I thought about it; yes, he's afraid that people won't know he's a superhuman artist. Balzac was accustomed to wearing colorful and strange clothes, parading through the streets, and the portraits of some famous musicians of the eighteenth century are full of that romantic long hair. So, of course, our modern artists who have not yet become famous in posterity should first imitate their hair; the problem lies here, putting aside whether they are famous or not. In the eighteenth century, women's fashion was to wear skirts that covered their toes and were as wide as large wooden barrels, but what about modern women? They wear dresses that are shorter and shorter. But the point is not just that; a genuine artist doesn't care about trying to imitate the appearance of their predecessors, but should focus on artistic attainments. Someone who understands the mission and dignity of art should hate the special nature of their appearance, as if pointing their nose on the street and loudly declaring, "I am an artist!" But that's just vanity. Studying art is a difficult task, and the appearance is no different from ordinary people. There is no glory inherently higher than a rickshaw puller. I believe that if Balzac and the musicians of that time were born in modern times, they would at most wear a regular white canvas suit and have their hair cut short.</p>
<p>Especially if you have not yet achieved success in the field of art, don't do this; there is a Chinese saying: "Gold and jade on the outside, rotten straw inside." Which is worth alerting to. Even if you have already achieved immortal achievements, you should not do so even more; as long as you are truly humble and devote yourself to artistic creation, even if you don't have romantic long hair, people will still admire you, and will not reduce their respect for you because you are bald or have short hair. Conversely, people may not say it to your face, but behind your back, they may say, "Sham empty-headed artist!"</p>
<h3>The Trade of Selling Shrunken Heads in South America</h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>In Quito, the capital of Ecuador in South America, I woke up in my hotel to find someone holding a woman's head in front of my face. Quito is located 9,500 feet above sea level. People who arrive for the first time already feel short of breath, and after this scare, although not dead, I was almost unable to breathe. The dim light in the living room, shining into my dark bedroom from the open door, illuminated a woman's face, close to my face—a raspy voice said urgently, "Sir! Light sir! Fifty dollars! Very cheap!"</p>
<p>The head that the person was holding was indeed a real girl's head, which her beautiful and long black hair could prove. This hair is difficult to fake.</p>
<p>How the South American Indians remove the bones from human heads and shrink them to a quarter of their living size has always been one of the world's mysteries.</p>
<p>Today, in the Andes Mountains area of South America, you can secretly buy this kind of shrunken head. In the city of Popayan, Colombia, a chemist had three heads to sell me, each worth thirty-five dollars, but I didn't buy them for two reasons: first, I superstitiously believed that the head would bring me bad luck. Second, I was about to set off for Ecuador at the time, and the Ecuadorian government fined anyone carrying that kind of head four hundred dollars.</p>
<p>Almost everyone who travels to South America wants to buy a shrunken head to bring back home and show off. The Ecuadorian government says that buying heads from the Indians will encourage them to "increase the supply of this kind of head."</p>
<p>When I left Quito, crossed the Andes Mountains, and arrived at the port of Guayaquil on the Pacific coast, people were still calling out to me to sell heads.</p>
<p>This was on the deck of the ship, after having already passed through Ecuadorian customs, and if I had bought it, I would not have been fined.</p>
<p>A native came up on deck, hiding a head inside his clothes. But we didn't buy it because of the superstition of bad luck.</p>
<p>"This is a tragedy," the shipping company employee drinking with me on deck said to me. "Was it red-haired? About a year ago, we had a partner disappear. He was going to a certain place, and we often thought that he might have been caught by the Indians."</p>
<p>I cried, but the captain sitting next to me didn't cry. He had been sailing on the west coast of South America for nearly thirty years, and after he told me the story of a German who lost his head, I understood why he didn't cry.</p>
<p>This German was an elderly anthropologist, his head as bald as an egg, with a scar on his face that ran from his cheek straight to his ear.</p>
<p>His best and oldest friend was an Englishman, who was the retired manager of a coastal steamship company. One day, he sent this old German anthropologist to Peru.</p>
<p>The German left Peru and said, "I'm going to cross the Andes Mountains to Iquitos. I may be gone for a few years, because I'll wait until I know how the Indians shrink heads before I come back."</p>
<p>Two years passed without hearing from him. One day, when the Englishman was sitting on the deck of his ship anchored in Callao, Peru, a child came up with a note. The note was from the owner of an antique shop in Callao, asking the Englishman to come ashore once. He went.</p>
<p>"Very good," the owner said, "he's here."</p>
<p>The Englishman took the head of his old friend in his hands. There was no mistake—the scar and the bald head.</p>
<p>"This head," the antique shop owner said happily, rubbing his hands, "belongs to your old companion. How much will you pay?"</p>
<p>The Englishman glared at the owner with hatred, but he finally decided to buy it peacefully instead of venting his revenge. After the Englishman returned to the ship, he ordered his steward to immediately bring a bottle of whiskey to his cabin.</p>
<h3>Difficulty in Seeking Knowledge</h3>
<p>— Zhou Zhou</p>
<p>Lian Da, the United University, renowned throughout the nation, established in the rear during the War of Resistance. In the first summer after the victory, it held its first enrollment in Shanghai, providing an opportunity for further education to many friends in Jiangnan. This is something praised by countless students, and at the same time, it can be said to be a small step forward in our national education. Here, I do not want to list its advantages one by one; I only want to summarize a few pains of some candidates (or they). Such pain is added to a group of young people who are eager to learn, and at the very least, I want to ask those in charge to improve it!</p>
<p>The shortness of the registration period is a common situation in many schools. Taking Lian Da as an example, nearly ten thousand candidates had to collect registration numbers at the same location within two days. The congestion is imaginable. Although the Lian Da authorities have taken kind measures, many candidates have difficulty obtaining registration numbers. I personally saw the notice on the bulletin board of Jiaotong University, "Seeking Registration Numbers." It is hard to believe that this is not true!</p>
<p>The food and lodging problems of the candidates: A few days ago, the open-air playground, under the eaves, and on the floors of Jiaotong University were filled with many sleeping candidates. Mosquitoes and ants constantly attacked, and the weather changed suddenly from cold to hot. Imagine that this group of young people, who are not yet fully healthy, cannot bear it, especially at a time when epidemics are prone to occur. Although Jiaotong University students posted a notice: "Epidemics are prevalent, and sleeping in the playground is prohibited." However, where do you tell them to go! For food, many of them are being exploited by merchants. Jiaotong University, with a candidate service group, has already fulfilled many of its obligations to them! However, it is still far from perfection.</p>
<p>Life is difficult, and seeking knowledge is also difficult. In this era, life is really too bitter for the poor!</p>
<h3>Welcoming the New and Seeing Off the Diligent: It's Hard to be a High Official, Even Harder to be a Low Official</h3>
<p>— Fu Jun</p>
<p>It is not easy to be a high official, and it is even more difficult to be a low official. Above the high official, there are still higher officials; below the small rich, there are even more minor officials. Flattering and fawning, speaking in a low voice, it is really big fish eat small fish, small fish eat shrimp, shrimp eat mud and sand... layer upon layer, weight upon weight, mutually overcoming and generating each other, never ending.</p>
<p>When the new official comes, the subordinates are uneasy, trembling with fear, lest they lose their jobs. So, they pool public funds, one thousand from you, three thousand from me. Cocktail parties may not have this ability, but a grand tea party is quite lively! Who knows that after three or five days, a batch of "chickens and dogs" brought by the new official will "ascend to heaven," replacing the old ones. The small official ends up getting the sack!</p>
<p>When the old official leaves, the ones who are busy are still the "followers," isn't it the same as welcoming the new, pooling public funds again, everyone chipping in, one thousand from you, three thousand from me, still a tea party to entertain? Some who do it better will go a step further to mobilize the business community and the broad masses of people, erecting a "memorial tablet of remembrance" and presenting an "umbrella of ten thousand people"! Those small officials who ascended to heaven from being chickens and dogs, of course, all scatter like monkeys.</p>
<p>Welcoming the new and seeing off the old, seeing off the old and welcoming the new, cycling endlessly, like a zoetrope. The officialdom is full of "change," "change" leads to "movement," and "movement" leads to everything "falling"! It is still the small officials who suffer! In fact, it is the common people who suffer even more! They welcome the new today and send off the old tomorrow, busy coming and going, without any hope of "ascending to heaven," and certainly without any "monkeys" to be. Their fat and grease are used by new and old officials to start fires, and they themselves are not allowed to light lamps without orders!</p>
<h3>Think of the Next Generation!</h3>
<p>— Yan Mo</p>
<p>Recently, I have seen crowds of people (children and adults) filling the roadsides everywhere I look. Children sitting on a long bench are engrossed and immersed in their fantasies, lowering their heads and turning the pages with uncertain fingers. They forget the scorching sun, the noisy voices, and this bustling, flowery world. In their world, there are only toy guns, real guns, wall-walking heroes, and treasures that go "zha" with a sound. They watch with fascination, their heads leaning closer together, how absorbing and delightful, better than listening to lectures in the classroom! In the evenings, in our alleyways, groups of children hold wooden knives and bamboo poles, one knife from you, one spear from me, acting out "being in their shoes," expressing their fantasies in action.</p>
<p>Children are most imaginative, curious, and easily influenced. Everyone should not forget how, a few years ago, seventeen- or eighteen-year-old youths, poisoned by martial arts novels and detective novels, went into the mountains to seek teachers, and how they put into practice their ideal of "robbing the rich to help the poor." This kind of poisoning can easily lead children's thoughts astray. How dangerous! Children are like a blank sheet of pure white paper, which can be used with colors to create a beautiful picture, and can also be used with dirty ink to paint a black paper. We hope that children will become beautiful and great pictures, or useless black paper?</p>
<p>To satisfy children's curiosity, to achieve their fantasies, it is even more necessary to equip them with a suitable environment to develop their instincts and satisfy their needs. In the sacred golden age of children, the quality of the environment is what lays the foundation for their future thoughts, outlook on life, personality, character, and the quality of their behavior. So, can we ignore the children's environment?</p>
<p>Children crowding around small bookstores are really an expression of their need to fill their spiritual food. But we should pay attention: Is the spiritual food we provide harmless? What are the resulting effects? I hope that in the near future, there will be many children's libraries instead of small bookstores on the streets, cultivating their basic interest in literature, art, and science. Curiosity is the source of interest, interest is the source of love, and love is the source of deep pursuit, so children today lack spiritual food and need spiritual food! Save the children!</p>
