<h3>張羣飛美就醫　昨乘軍專機離滬</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕川主席張羣，昨晨飛美就醫，張氏係於右耳後下方息一小瘤，後因知係癌症，故特出國治療。據張氏家屬吿記者，張氏此症曾動手術，痛楚尙不甚烈，至出國日期，張氏雖已藉假三月，然仍須視治療情形而定。</p>
<p>〔中央社本市訊〕四川省政府主席張羣，偕夫人馬育英女士，醫師董秉奇等，昨晨七時由江灣機塲乘坐美軍用專機取道東京，夏威夷等地飛美就醫，前往機塲送別者有吳鐵城，吳國楨，張君勱，錢新之諸氏，專機於晨九時啓飛離滬。記者昨訪張長公子繼正，探詢伊父病狀，承吿渠頸部所患之瘤，初意並無大患，迨本月五日在蓉入院開刀後，經醫診斷係一毒瘤，恐有波及甲狀腺之可能，非經深度愛克斯光探騐，不能根治，現國內無此項設備，故不得不赴美求治，又據接近張氏者稱，渠頭部之瘤，經割治後雖感疼痛，惟精神尙佳，飲食如常，九日晚抵滬後，曾在亞爾培路私邸與來訪之重要賓客宋院長子文，吳秘書長鐵城，吳文官長鼎昌及張君勱，錢新之，杜月笙諸氏，晤談甚暢。</p>

<h3>美國報人論中共　始終為第三國際之構成份子　與莫斯科有密切聯繫</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京十日電〕美國華盛頓新聞報於八月廿八日登載專欄作家拉摩爾氏論「中共是否確係共黨」之專論一篇，內容要點如次：</p>
<p>若干人士以爲中共並非共產黨，而係自由主義者，民主份子，及土地改革者之結合，惟自報紙中之讀者來函視之，則咸認爲莫斯科方面業經承認延安之共產黨人爲合格之共產黨員，此於莫斯科廣播及蘇聯報章中，均足證明蘇聯從不承認傍徨歧途及意志欠堅定者爲共產黨員。</p>
<p>直至大戰期間，第三國際佯稱解散時爲止，中國共產黨人，始終爲該組織之有力構成份子，毛澤東且任該組織之報行委員，去歲十一二月間，紐約州共產黨總部所散佈之小册中，甚至將毛所著「論新民主主義」及「爲新中國而鬥爭」二書，與列寗及史達林之著作列爲共產黨員之必讀物，最近李敏然（立三）被任爲林彪之政治顧問，足以表示莫斯科與中共之密切聯繫，李與蘇聯佔領軍同蒞東北，中共即於彼時獲得日俘之軍火與武器，現正用以進行其反抗政府之戰爭，中共中央政治局通告，吾人近已得其譯文，通告中說明該局與第三國際遠東分局意見一致，此表示第三國際又趨活躍。</p>

<h3>我在日製造鐵路車輛　談判竣事待批准　由我供給高等工業用煤</h3>

<p>社論</p>
<h3>怎樣處置戰敗的日本？</h3>
<p>中國出席和會代表團團長王世傑外長，以要公待理，已於昨日啟程返國，臨行時曾接見美法兩國記者，發表談話，闡明中國對日政策。其要點有六：（一）遠東和平有賴巴黎和會的成功甚鉅；（二）中國在戰時雖蒙受重大損失，但不提出超過日本償付通車之賠款要求；（三）至起草對日和約時，中國不採取報復政策；（四）中美兩國之對日政策，大體相同；（五）中國造成美國所提出之四強解除日本武裝二十五年條約。（六）和平如不以正義為基礎，即不能維持長久；戰敗國僅在軍事上失敗，猶不足保障世界的安全。</p>
<p>王外長的談話，充滿了正義感，對於戰敗的敵國，猶能如此寬大為懷，已獲得世界各國的注意及重視，對於在巴黎的若干國家的代表，欲以苛刻條件加諸戰敗國者，不啻是一種深刻的諷刺。惟王外長發表這種談話的動機，也不過藉此說明中國政府對於巴黎和會的成敗是如何的關切而已。因為在現行國際關係之下，歐洲的僵局如果打不開，遠東問題就不能單獨解決。換言之，這次巴黎和會如果不能簽訂對義·羅·匈·保·芬五國的和約，則對日和約也無從起草。對日和平在理論上雖較對德和平為簡單，但在列強間的關係，尤其是英美與蘇聯的關係，如果不能改善，則也不容易解決。王外長在外長會議中所以贊成聯合國大會延期至十月二十三日舉行，其用意也無非要各國政治外交家特別重視巴黎和會，集中努力，俾使巴黎和會能夠早日圓滿閉幕。</p>
<p>日本正式向盟國投降，為去年的九月三日，對中國投降則為九月九日，迄今正是整整的一年，在盟軍最高統帥麥克阿瑟元帥的管制之下，戰敗的日本，確能按步就班的向着盟國管制日本的目標邁進，不論是武鬥的解除，防務的撤消，軍火工業的停閉，重工業的改組，政治的民主化，以及人民的再教育，澈底消滅日本人民的侵略思想，均有相當的成就。但是所成問題的，第一是日本人民的尚未完全覺悟，到現在還不承認戰敗，心中猶以為數十年之後，就可以東山再起，在國際舞台上露面。第二是對日和約尚未起草，美國國務院雖已在搜集材料，準備起草對日和約；但是展望世界的前途，遠東和會不知要到何日始能開幕。第三是美蘇兩國的對日政策，完全背道而馳，甚至積不相容；美國管制日本成績卓著，中英兩國一致稱道；但是蘇聯始終表示不滿，且常常攻擊麥帥縱容日本，助長日本侵略勢力的抬頭。第四是朝鮮問題，依照莫斯科三國外長的宣言，朝鮮已分裂為二，北部受蘇聯的管制，南部受美國的管制，將來如何在經濟上政治上獲得統一，確是一個最感棘手的問題。</p>
<p>中國對於戰敗的日本，不採取報復政策，而能寬大為懷，在道義是值得稱道的；但是我們要注意，「寬大」不是「縱容」，更不是「姑息」；我們如欲保持遠東和平，就該隨時防範日本的重整軍備，隨時注意日本侵略勢力的抬頭。使人們最感到迫切的問題，乃係對日和約簽字後如何管制日本的問題。在起草和約之前，都應該考慮到的。尤其是麥帥在九月三日日本簽降一週年紀念日發表文告稱：『日本今後在世界上所處的地位，將為和平的堡壘呢？抑將變為戰爭的跳板呢？』這一個警告，正是針對着中英美蘇四強管制日本委員會而發，是值得吾人深思的。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕巴黎十日廣播倫敦訊：巴勒斯坦會議今晨在此明朗之氣候下揭幕。關凱斯特大廈四週警衛眾多，十一時前片刻，阿拉伯國代表進入會場，貝文外長工亦隨即入場。會議於十一時正開始英首相艾德禮首先發表演說，鼓掌之聲不絕於耳，經久始止，各代表隨即赴會場對面廳內稍憩，廳內佈置長方巨桌，配以藍色檯絨，紅色座椅，擺滿咖啡杯壺，土耳其烟味充溢室中，誠雍容華貴之至。各代表步出大廳時，貝文謂：「咖啡味道還算不錯」，渠乃第一返入會場之人。殖民部發言人在今日上午會議將終時宣稱：關凱斯特大廈之門，始終洞開，猶太代表盡可於最後之一刻內，決定前來參加。猶太協會執委今日在倫敦開會集議，此間人士相信，在英政府尚未不接受猶人之對案前，非正式談判之門當仍未閉，此等非正式會談，可視作日後正式會議時之討論基礎。但英政府方面人士表示，非正式會談次數已嫌太多，不能以此等非正式會談之屢次舉行，而致使阿猶糾紛中英國不偏不倚之公正態度，引人發生疑竇云。</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敦十日電〕巴勒斯坦會議，今日在此揭幕，由艾德禮首相致辭，表示想念巴勒斯坦問題，並非不能解決者。但需要高度政治家之行動，始能有解決。巴勒斯坦阿拉伯族及猶太團體，均無代表參加。今日之會議，猶太協會發言人今晨並表示懷疑，猶太代表隨後將參加會議。當各代表今晨驅車赴關凱特斯特廳之會場時，觀者甚少，情形冷落，首先到場者為沙地阿拉伯代表·埃及·外約但·敘利亞·黎巴嫩·伊拉克及聯合王國代表　之，敘利亞首席代表於艾德里致辭畢，起立答謝，會議旋即暫停休息。</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敦十日電〕巴勒斯坦會議，今日在悲觀空氣中揭幕，英官方對於此點，亦毫不加以掩飾。目前雖不能斷定巴勒斯坦之猶·阿兩族代表，將始終拒絕出席，但此一可能性，顯然極大。目前之問題，是否僅由英政府與阿拉伯國代表交換意見，即能有任何肯定結果。英官方認為與阿拉伯有勢力之代表交換意見，或能有有益之結果。今日開會時，率直之事實，乃為此次會議，若無猶太代表出席，僅由英國與阿拉伯國成立協定，不能認為成功。但此次會議即使破裂，亦不過為形式上之破裂，蓋英國仍可向有關各方面徵求意見，而採取在行政上最合實際之措施。而阿拉伯國家亦可向聯合國機構提出申訴，但如到達此一階段，則與此會之動機大相違背矣。</p>
<p>〔聯合社巴黎九日電〕希伯來民族解放會秘書長茂林，現以新聞記者資格參加和會，據談：倫敦今日開幕之巴勒斯坦會議，已降而為英政府與其附庸阿拉伯封建酋長之談話。英外相貝文曾邀請阿拉伯同盟秘書長阿藤姆，該同盟在國際法下不能存在，其代表何得參加巴勒斯坦會議，則其決議自必一無足取云。</p>
<p>〔路透社耶路撒冷九日電〕巴勒斯坦阿拉伯高級委員會副主席賈馬爾赫賽尼，應外約但王之邀，赴該國首邑阿曼，商談出席倫敦會議事，賈氏意仍堅決，表示不擬出席。</p>
<h3>恐怖行動方興未艾　巴勒斯坦全境戒嚴　英大軍開抵海發從事搜捕</h3>
<p>〔聯合社耶路撒冷九日電〕巴勒斯坦恐怖行動，方興未艾。此間英軍司令部今夜接台拉維夫來電，謂該處新聞處已被炸毀。同時猶太恐怖團體今日通告各報，承認昨日陰謀破壞行動，係彼等所為，目的在反對倫敦會議及英政府之巴勒斯坦計劃，謂此一計劃徒然葬送巴勒斯坦之和平。倫敦會議開始日，巴勒斯坦各處發生爆炸及開槍情事，顯為猶太人大規模恐怖行動之一部份。</p>
<p>〔聯合社耶路撒冷九日電〕巴勒斯坦全境已宣布戒嚴，並嚴厲實施宵禁。私人汽車禁止在公路行駛。鐵路被切斷與炸毀者達五十處以上，鐵路效能因已阻斷。</p>
<p>〔中央社倫敦八日合眾電〕英軍現大量開往海發港，搜捕殺害英軍上士之恐怖份子，八萬軍隊現已駐防巴力斯坦所有要點，必要時隨時可以策動。及恐怖份子隊已派駐主要鐵路各站，攔捕今日侵晨廣泛襲擊鐵路，而刻在逃逸中之恐怖份子。</p>
<h3>烏克蘭控案　英美代表駁斥</h3>
<p>〔聯合社紐約九日電〕聯合國安理會今日以九票對一票表決，請阿爾巴尼亞代表列會，就烏克蘭控訴希臘及英國一案，陳述意見。英代表賈德幹獨投反對票，賈氏指烏克蘭對於希臘最近公民投票之懷疑，斥為「信口雌黃」。美代表約翰森亦以驚人行動，切實駁斥烏克蘭，認為希臘公民投票所受指責，「並不確實」。據美視察員報告，非法投票者甚少，不足以改變投票結果。</p>

<p>〔聯合社雅典十日電〕雅典居民今日相率抬頭觀看美航艦羅斯福號之七十四架飛機，在半哩高天空，組成羅斯福總統姓名之縮寫「F.D.R」三字。重四萬五千噸之羅斯福號，係泊於四十餘哩外海中，飛機飛出後，先列成另一圖案，然後編成「F.D.R」三字。該艦昨晨出雅典港，經過雅典南面之水雷區，駛泊海中。</p>

<p>〔合眾社巴黎十日電〕今日自可靠方面獲悉：蘇聯雖仍以為特里埃斯特應歸南斯拉夫，但將遵守四強外長會議之協定，而將使特港國際化，並依所謂法國綫劃分義南國境。同時並悉，美國不久即將以其意見通知對義政治委員會，眾信義南國境問題之緊張階段即將到臨。南斯拉夫人士私下亦承認無法貫澈該國之主張，彼等深知蘇聯並不能予以支持。</p>

<p>蘇聯幕後秘密揭穿了。（本報資料室）</p>
<h3>和會各委員會開會　英美集團取攻勢　英與巴西放棄對義賠償要求　保向希臘索土斥為厚顔無恥</h3>
<p>〔聯合社巴黎九日電〕和會已進入第七週，英美兩國今日在各委員會中開始總攻，指責蘇聯欲將希臘領土給與保加利亞，作為侵略酬勞。英國與巴西並放棄對義大利之直接賠償要求，各委員會中均由美·英·巴西及自治領代表首先發言。和會須在十月二十日前結束，以便接續舉行聯合國大會，因此除芬蘭和約政治委員會外，其他和約委員會一律開會。南非代表喬爾登稱道希臘曾英勇抵抗，並以保加利亞之領土要求為厚顔無恥。英國代表則謂此與匈牙利要求特里埃斯特港作出口無異。美國駐蘇大使史密斯在匈牙利和約政治委員會反對捷克之蠶食匈牙利，謂應就捷克提議放逐匈牙利少數民族一事加以討論，此舉將成立一遷移少數民族之危險原則。英國於取消對義賠償要求時，保留實行義大利和約第六十九條之權利，（按該條款規定，凡盟國或其協約國對義有要求賠償之權者，得扣留或以他法處置在其本國境內之義國或義人民之財産權及利益，義人之財産因此而處置者應由義政府予以賠償）准許英國沒收在協約國及其殖民地內之義大利資産，以抵償所受戰爭損害，其數位並未宣布，但據英國若干方面估計義大利資産之價值，不過兩百五十萬鎊。和會於同時繼續討論義大利南斯拉夫邊界問題，謀迅速完成五次要軸心國之和約草案。義大利和約政治領土委員會主席南非代表艾其倫稱，上週雖經一番唇舌，並未轉變使特里埃使特成為一國際自由港之四強提議，艾氏主張規定此自由港界限大小問題，應交由小組委員會解決。南斯拉夫代表巴勃勒稱，南代表團擬將其界綫問題分為四部份，並建議由蘇·美·英·法·中·南斯拉夫·白俄羅斯及巴西另成立一小組委員會以處理此問題。</p>
<h3>對保和約第一條　希臘提出修正案</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社巴黎九日電〕和會對保政治及領土委會本日開會，討論和約第一條，希臘代表比賓耐利斯宣稱，吾人認為保加利亞所提要求，並不公允，且無根據。關於「保加利亞在愛琴海之出口」一層按在一九二三年舉行洛桑會議時，我國曾擬以若干便利畀予保加利亞，但遭該國拒絕。無論如何，此項出口並非保國所不能缺少者，良以該國整個經濟機構，正傾向中歐，有多瑙河及黑海港口，即足敷其出口所需。我國對於第一條提出修正案如下：「附於本條約之地圖，已表明保國之疆界將為一九四一年一月一日以前所存在之疆界，即自比利姆——帕拉尼亞——多斯巴特——加萊克巴爾幹——以達貝斯克蒂潑至阿爾達流域一綫，此乃本委會討論之基礎。至於南斯拉夫所稱「馬其頓人民之自由」，實與「希特勒之術語」相類似。至此白俄羅斯代表基塞萊夫即委員會主席加以阻止稱，最後一語顯然侮辱南斯拉夫代表，此後發言，尚望多用外交辭令云</p>
<h3>捷匈間疆界糾紛　設小組委會研究</h3>
<p>〔路透社巴黎九日電〕美國今日在和會中支持捷克之要求匈牙利跟與多瑙河南岸斯洛伐克首邑勃拉蒂斯拉伐對岸之迦谷區。美代表史密斯謂該區之面積，應較捷克所要求者略少，使若干馬札爾族所居之村落，仍留在匈國境內。渠復建議此事最好由捷匈兩國直接談判協定，和會對該事不妨暫緩討論。捷克代表克萊曼蒂斯復補充稱，勃拉蒂斯拉伐之欲擴大，亦具有安全之用意，渠復否認匈牙利所稱捷克有因此突入匈境之意，反之，捷克之意乃在修正捷克原來突出之疆界。克萊曼蒂斯表示並不反對由小組委員會調查此事，最後乃議決設立小組委員會，由澳·紐西蘭·烏克蘭·加拿大及捷克組成，研究捷克之要求。</p>
<h3>美拒絕公佈　駐外軍隊情形</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕華盛頓十日廣播：美對蘇聯要求各國將駐在外國（前敵佔領區除外）之軍隊實力，及配置情形，予以公佈一節，已斷然加以反對。據消息靈通官方人士稱：美準備以全力推翻此項建議，雖至再度引起對蘇緊張關係，亦所不惜。</p>
<h3>王外長離法前談話　和平應基於正義　列強關係不改善德日和平難期　我國內問題應循政治途徑解決</h3>
<p>〔中央社巴黎九日專電〕我外長王世杰，昨單獨接見法半官方報紙世界報外記者，謂遠東之和平，極賴此次和會之成功。王外長在返國之前夕，分別單獨接見法國世界報，英國倫敦泰晤士報，及美國紐約時報等訪員，發表談話。王氏對世界報訪員所談頗多，自渠對解放後法國之印象，渠對巴黎和會之意見，以至於中國之共黨問題等，均有述及。世界報將王氏談話置於今日該報之首頁。王氏在談話中稱：如五國和約能簽訂成立，則列強關係自可改善。上述強國之政治家，設在此刻能明瞭如何在此情勢中有所獲益，並能加倍努力</p>
<p>造成真誠合作，則余可斷言，將來處理更重要更困難之德日兩國問題時必能不經過份困難，而獲致協定。王氏繼稱：對日和平容易，賠償問題尤少複雜，領土及其他問題亦然，但王氏重申設無列強關係之改善，是德日兩國和平均不能達成，蓋無互信空氣，一切均屬不可能也。反之，若此種良好空氣造成後，一切均可成為簡單。世界報訪員詢及中國對戰敗後日本之態度如何，王氏答：中國不信奉報復政策，中國予日本民主份子以援助，並准許彼等鞏固其地位。該訪員又詢渠認目前美對日政策滿意否？王氏答：中美兩國之對日政策大致相同。</p>
<p>對解放後法國之印象王氏謂：法國之政治經濟復原，其速度殊出意料。渠對巴黎及其他法國大城市未受損害，甚感欣慰。提及中國共黨問題時，謂中央政府之立場，認為中國之內政問題，惟有循和平及政治手段解決之。余本人相信忍耐，蓋時間能協助解決問題也。王氏之話題，又自荷屬東印度轉至直越南問題，謂渠亦同樣希望荷屬東印度，及越南問題能獲致和平解決。王氏末稱：余堅信法國得知如何表達其公正自由之歷史傳統精神，前途困難雖大，然並非不可能克服。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社巴黎九日電〕中國外長王世杰頃向世界報記者發表談話，謂遠東和平有賴巴黎和會成功甚鉅。觀於盧森堡宮內各國代表所面臨之主要問題，可知和平如不能以正義為基礎，即不能持久，所謂正義，即對弱小各國及戰敗各國</p>
<p>均應保持正義良以戰敗各國，如其國內仍埋有禍根，則其在軍事上失敗，猶不足以保障歐洲安全故也。余想念巴黎和會對於此項原則，業已加以尊重。此次會議雖曾發生熱烈辯論，但余以為四強所提出之解決辦法，在大體上尚屬良好，惟和會討論義大利前殖民地之鼾問題，業已決定延期舉行，殊可扼腕，中國代表團建議：和會對義大利前殖民地里比亞，應立即使其獨立，如不可能，則應提交聯合國機構託管若干年，然後再宣佈獨立。</p>
<p>〔中央社東京十日電〕著名之午報東京新聞，今日以極顯著地位刊載我外長王世杰在巴黎所發表之聲明。謂中國對日之賠償要求，將不超過日本之賠償能力。小型報民報，亦以顯著地位刊載王氏之談話。</p>

<h3>國際法庭揭露日陰謀　樹立僞政權內幕　近衛廣播詞足為黷武明證</h3>
<p>〔改造社東京十日電〕遠東國際法庭檢察官，今日提出日本外務省所保管之記錄，揭露日本在中國樹立僞政權之幕後工作。據該記錄所載：華北方面，廿六年日方謀誘王克敏出組華北僞政權，當時王居香港，經駐平特務機關長熹多及山本榮治等之煽惑，王卒決定出任僞職，十二月十四日成立僞臨時政府。華中方面，僞大道政府係由僞市長蘇錫文，日陸軍武官楠本大佐，參謀本部影佐大佐等翰旋成立。僞上海市戰區善後整理會，以張嘯林之青帮勢力為後台，以虞洽卿等為中心，圖謀樹立僞政權，但未成功。管野長知，山田純三郎等陰謀擁立唐紹儀，居正等西山派樹立僞政權，亦未成功。其次上海金融界人物周作民等，謀刺探蔣主席對日意向，圖與日方接洽，但未具體化，又熊斌在上海活動，謀組所謂「江蘇治安維持會」，並謀與何應欽氏連絡，又汪精衛系神戶華僑，亦曾謀與上海日人連絡，其後由梁鴻志，任援道，陳羣，溫宗堯等，於三十一年三月廿八日出組僞維新政府。</p>
<p>〔聯合社東京十日電〕遠東國際軍事法庭今晨續審日本戰犯，檢察官方面提出無數證據，證明日本如何在滿洲及華北施行經濟侵略，且說明日本在智謀及軍事上殆具超人力量。據檢察官所提出之日本前首相近衛廣播詞中稱，日本國內民眾，絕對信任前方將士，正默然從事於戰時生産，並準備長期戰爭，此時吾人可重複表現日本固有精神。歷史昭示吾人國運之消長，胥視我全國人民能否認識日本國體為轉移。近衛演詞中復提及廣州及漢口之陷落，且謂「此後中國政府將僅為一地方政權，日本並未竭其兵力，即已收此效果。此乃日皇陛下聖德所致，使吾人感動非常」云</p>

<h3>龐大國營事業成功決　美國的草根制度（上）</h3>
<p>— —本報特派員毛樹清寄—</p>
<p>〔田納西州諾城八月十五日航訊〕在田納西的十天逗留時期，我感到最有興趣的，有兩件事：第一是偉大的水閘建築，及其取之不盡，用之不竭的電源，第二是這批叫叫鬧鬧的美國孩子，他們對國營事業，感覺著無上的新鮮與興趣。這是一個奇蹟，從美國開國到現在，像這樣大規模的一個企業，由國家來辦，還是第一次。我在紐約和芝加哥的時候，聽許多美國朋友講，其中有一半，對TVA的成敗，還在疑信參半之中，有很多美國人，詆毀TVA　一件世界上最愚蠢的舉動。他們說：企業怎麽可上政府經營？政本身就不懂得「生才之道！」我第一天到諾克斯微爾，劈頭就問情報署的副主任亭理先生，他說：外邊詆毀TVA，不是一兩個人零星的意見。「他們是有集團的組織的。你是新聞記者，你自然懂得什麽叫做宣傳。」他拿起一份小冊子，搖着說：「夠瞧哪，宣傳的力量大得很！」這本小書叫做「危險的TVA」，是一個名叫愛德溫，佛納特寫的，事後，我才知道佛給特是美國中西部電業公司的「發言人。」佛給特寫了這本書，一在已經成為美國的萬萬富翁了。TVA裏的人，聽見佛納特的名字，都要吐一朵口水，但</p>
<p>美國資本家托辣斯巨頭，正把佛納特的書像聖經一樣誦讀，介紹和宣揚。亨理送給我一份TVA油印品，是一份整整二十頁，洋洋數千言的「答辯書」，那是今年四月間才出版的，是TVA第一次對外來侮蔑的答辯。開頭就說：在美國，一在有一種力量，正和TVA的國營事業進攻，他們無中生有的造謠，毀謗，要促使TVA失敗和崩潰。他又列舉組成這一股反對力量的分子，包括：愛迪生電業公司，全國電業公司聯合會，美國全國總商會，水力委員會，三十一家自來水公司聯合會，以及其他許多利害衝突的機關。除了商業機關聯合反對TVA以外，答辯書中還列舉了一篇哈不爾雜誌上的文章，那是一位哈不爾雜誌的編輯，一位社會經濟學者格來頓寫的。格來頓於</p>
<p>考察TVA以後，認為這一次國營事業要失敗，他從經濟的觀點着眼，而且列舉出很多數字，說TVA的經營方法不合理，說：「我這篇批評的文章，電業公司的老　看了，一定要鼓掌歡呼，但是我聲明：我不是為他鼓掌而寫的，我是就事論事。」答辯書從財政現況，經營方法，以及還本付息的準備，寫得詳詳細細，說明TVA的經營不僅有利，而且利民。我不預備抄錄這些數字，因我以為：比還本付息更值得我們注意的，是國營事業的一個管理和組織問題。TVA從一九三三年成立起，十三年來他的組織一變再變，一直到現在，TVA的高級職員還不敢說他們現在的制度是一個完滿</p>
<p>理想的制度不過，因為TVA的不斷改進和試騐，美國人已開始認識國營事業是怎麽一回事，同時，TVA的本身的一再嘗試與改進，促成了他的事業的壯大。在田納西，到處可以聽見「草根」兩個字。草根的意思，並非中國辭　中的所謂「樹皮草根」，而是象徵一種組織機構的形態。草根向泥土深入，和四週發展，而留一條根的體系是獨立不相牽連的，這就是TVA的組織精神。十三年來，TVA從很小一個單位，發展成現在這樣的龐大，就得力於所謂「草根制度」的組織原則。「草根」兩個字，是誰沿用的？我無法考查。不過我知道，現任TVA的董事長李令肅先生，</p>
<p>是草根制度的一個提倡者。在李令肅漢有擔任TVA的董事以前，他就提倡政治的分權制度，他反對美國聯邦政府的萬事集權制，他說：美國的行政效能若要增強，必須實現「草根制度的民主政治」。前年，李令肅寫過一本書，叫「邁進中的民主政治——TVA」。這本書除了敍述TVA的建設以外，特別強調美國的經濟民主，即經濟的國家社會主義化，他對於行政管理和行政效率一點，敘說得很多，闡釋了很多草根制度的道理。我和TVA的許多朋友談「草根制度」，我覺得草根制度的概念，和中國的</p>
<p>分層負責制很相似，譬如說：TVA之下，現在有一個極龐大的部份，叫作「電力處」。在初成立的時候，管理電力的單位很小，原來附屬在董事會之內的，後來因為水閘紛紛完成，電力變成了TVA的主要部份，因為需要，便逐步擴大發展，成為今日龐大機構的電力處。電力處的處長，便是TVA所有關於電力事項的獨裁者，處長對總經理負責，總經理對董事長負責，但有關電力的事務，電力處長便無須向總經理「請示」，「呈判」，「劃行」這一套。再譬如說：電力處底下，現分三科：電力使用科，電力管理科，工程建設科，凡是有關於一科以內的事務，科長就可以全權處理，科長就有權對外行文，有時候，科長一個電話，根本沒有公文，更無須乎處長批核劃行這一套。分層負責的結果，是責任明確，彼此無法推諉，行政的效率快，事業發展容易。</p>

<h3>為女工謀福利　湯桂芬的提案</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕現任統益紗廠整理部看布女參職員湯桂芬，昨語記者稱：本市棉紡絲織業女工人數，約佔全工人總數百分之八十。其中半數有子女，須負擔家庭生活者，大部女工希望社會開設職工托兒所，然因大規模舉辦不易，要求以廠或各單位分設。湯女士在這大會書面提案中，曾提及此點，並要求工作時間減至十小時，此係最低要求，如可能，則一般女工，均深盼工作時間能減至八小時，多餘時間，可用於求學。</p>
<h3>市府各局支出用途　大會要求詳細報告</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕上海市三十五年下半年度歲入歲出總預算書，已於昨日下午由市府轉市參議會分發各參議員研究審核。散會前何參議員成甫提出臨時動議，請求市府各局對於財政支出及其開支用途，作詳細報告，以供審查。潘議長當即允將此動議提交市府各局，請各局將支出報告交第九組審查市預決算委員會審查，已出席報告之各局，仍須將此點補報。</p>
<p>據王參議員維　向記者表示：對於舉辦必要之事業經費，希望市府不因收入不敷而省免，寗可另行開征稅捐，以資挹注。</p>
<h3>四大機場佔地不發還　將依法徵收</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市江灣，虹橋，龍華，大塲等飛機塲，在淪陷期間，被敵偽佔據，並強圈附近民地甚廣，依收復區土地權利清理辦法第五條：「敵偽組織沒收或強佔之私有土地應由所有權人提出產權憑證發還之，如有土地法第二〇八條或二〇九條之情事時，得依法徵收之」。按土地法二〇八條即規定國家因公共事業（國防，交通，公用，水利等）之需要得徵收私有土地，土地法第二〇九條則規定政府因實施國家經濟政策得徵收私有土地。</p>
<p>市地政局為上項被佔民地，曾於祝局長接事後，即呈請市府轉函空軍重要基地，龍華則經指定為民航機塲，故所佔土地不能發還，市府當請依據法定補辦征用手續，此項手續續經過測量，調查地藉，公告，估價等，關於虹橋，龍華二塲之測丈費用，航委會已允負担，其預算已於本年七月由地政局呈市府轉空軍當局，一俟經費撥到，即開始工作，至其他各機塲則正由該局再與空軍當局接洽中。</p>
<h3>朗讀報告如同上課　經濟時間言歸正傳</h3>
<p>昨天宣鐵吾局長報告時，根據印好的書面工作報告朗讀一遍，參議員們有的看報，有的寫字，有人說這倒很像在上課。</p>
<p>衛生局長張維報告時，旁證博引，參議員們大概認為「離題太遠」了，趙仰雲為經濟時間計起來說：「請張局長言歸正傳」。</p>
<p>會塲牆上有警察局和衛生局張掛的大幅統計圖表十餘幅</p>
<p>上午會程至吳市長答復前日各參議員質詢時，室外大雨滂沱。市長答復至陶百川所提「亂」的問題時，突然一聲霹靂，四座驚動。後解釋生活指數時，又接連兩聲大雷。</p>
<p>陶百川的座位是全塲最末一號，第一百七十五號，但是他發表意見時却常有驚人之言。</p>
<p>宣局長報告中曾說：「女招待就是上海人所謂玻璃杯，最是妨害風化的東西。」</p>
<p>宣局長又說：「有一次某處火災消防隊到後因龍頭無水，一時不能開始施救，就有謠傳說索詐四千萬，我敢擔保決無其事。」</p>
<p>女參議員田淑君原座一五九號，昨日下午開會時喬遷至後面一六六號與仝道雲女議員作伴，可是到四點廿分，一六六號童襄列席，田女士祗得讓位「打道回座」。返座後並交換茶杯，龐參議員京周，在昨日下午衛生局長張維報告施政後，伏案埋頭苦幹，把眼鏡架在額上，很緊張的樣子，大概是在寫什麽質詢稿。</p>
<h3>會塲花絮錄</h3>
<p>吳市長昨日答覆各質詢時，態度從容，簡潔扼要，令人佩服。市長在回答張學濂所提「市長對於民眾能否接近一些，市長接近區長，不啻隨時與民眾接近」。市長說：我認為這話「對到極點」。</p>
<p>逸園會場中，前日及昨日上午均有原泡清茶一杯，昨日下午忽　為普通紅茶一杯。</p>
<p>衛生局長張維出席報告，隨帶主任秘書，及四位處長同來，以備答覆各參議員之質詢。</p>
<h3>玻璃杯罪孽深重　大雷雨聲驚四座</h3>
<p>三次大會散會前數分鍾，參議員呂恩澤放了一砲，質問市長對糧貸案何故推得幹幹淨淨？散會時，吳市長急趨呂參議員座前解釋，說是糧貸案和市府的確不相干，且一切案卷皆不在市府，所以對糧貸案事實經過，也無從報告。</p>
<p>某參議員施展交際手段，向若干記者分發卡片及請柬。</p>
<h3>市長口頭答覆質詢　亂的情形意見相同　都市計劃明年完成</h3>
<p>市長口頭答覆前日各參議員之質詢，其主要者可歸納如下：（一）攤販問題：取締者均係資本甚大之攤販，因其妨礙正當商業，且為碼頭失竊貨物之銷場，但窮苦小民擺設之小吃攤烟攤等暫不取締。至於集中營業辦法，第一要看貨物來路是否正當，其次是否能照營業稅法納稅而決定。（二）房屋問題：房屋分配委員會在虹口區接收房屋六千餘棟，詳細清單九月中可公佈。市政府接收後，決仍嚴格縷縷執行分配，對於若干機關強佔房屋情形，除向其上級機關交涉外，並希望與論制裁。一方面鼓勵建築，希望能根本解決。（三）糧食問題：數日來市上又有謠言，希望大家不要輕信，前天米價並未上漲，南市場且下跌四千元左右。台灣米及其他米即可運到，九月底新年穀亦可登場，將來如米價不穩，將仍採取配給制度。</p>
<p>（四）勞資問題決根據中央法令處理，最近理髪業糾紛，經仲裁後事實上並示有變更。（五）何德奎案，係由參政會向中央檢舉，現司法行政部已派員來滬查過，不久當可完全公佈。（六）糧貸案非市府職權範圍不便答復。（七）關於市府本身者：一，興業信託社係前市長任內成立，原來工作係市輪渡及市中心區地産徵收發賣等，現在工作為建築平民邨。二，曾在僞組織任職人員，最近中央已有辦法頒到，將依照辦理。三，接收敵産管理處處理費一項係前市長任內規定，為償付點查搬動等之費用，原定三百萬元，現已減至一百萬元或二百萬元，帳目將問來公開四，生活指數根據米布疋等主要物品計算，係統計學上題，至於縮短發表期間恐將刺激人心，不擬實行。（八）關於「亂」的情形，本人意見亦相同，並竭力想從亂中求得秩序與安定，希望與參議員共同合作。（九）前租界之産業現由清理委員會處理，惟組織上最近稍有變更。（十）棚戶問題，擅自搭建的嚴格取締，一方面獎勵合法的建築。（十一）碼頭竊風嚴密取締，港口委員會即將成立。（十二）關於整個都市計劃希望於明年第三屆參議會前完成。</p>
<h3>各組審查會　召集人名單</h3>
<p>市參議會以本屆第一次大會提案甚多，特根據各參議員經歷或自願參加各組之聲明，分設審查委員會十組，其各組召集人名單如下：</p>
<p>第一審查委員會（審查關於民政，自治之提案，施政報告及其他不屬各組之提案等）召集人朱文德，陳保泰，張志韓。</p>
<p>第二審查委員會（審查關於警務保安之提案及施政報告等）召集人金德寰，姜屏藩，姜懷素。</p>
<p>第三審查委員會（審查關於財政地政之提案及施政報告等）召集人路式導，趙棣華，駱清華。</p>

<p>第八審查委員會（審查關於衛生之提案及施政報告等）召集人史致富，田淑君，龐京周。</p>
<p>第九審查委員會（審核市預決算）召集人李文杰，何元明，徐永祚。</p>
<p>第十審查委員會（審查關於單行規章及法律之提案）召集集人徐士浩，馮有真，陶百川。</p>
<h3>應否參加清查團　各議員意見不一　陶百川認為清查團不起作用　先問問還有幾天壽命？</h3>
<p>昨日大會過程中最精彩的一幕是在下午將近散會的時候，壁鍾已指五點半了，議長在宣佈散會以前，說有一件事報告。他宣讀了蘇浙皖區接收物資清查團的來函，內容是請市參議會選派一位議員參加他們的清查工作。</p>
<p>議長問大家怎樣選出這一位參加清查工作的參議員來，當時有人主張用票選，大家似乎根本沒有考慮到是不是「可以」接受清查團的請求的問題，但是，突然之間，陶百川以異軍突起的姿態起立，發表了爆彈性的意見。</p>
<p>他說：「關於接收物資清查團的成立我上次以參政員的資格參加參政會時，曾經加以反對，因為我認為清查團決不會發生什麽作用，但是我的意見並沒有被採納。現在從事實來看，清查團的確沒有發生什麽作用，將來它寫起報告來說接收的情形都很好，白白的替別人肩負起法律上的責任，實在很不值得，而且現在清查團馬上就要結束，在杭州不久就要回到南京去，我們更不值得在這個時候派人參加替那些發勝利財的人負起法律上的責任」！</p>
<p>他的話還沒有說完，就獲得了場中熱烈的掌聲。當議長詢問有沒有人附議他的意見時，參議員們紛紛興趣手，而且表情都很激動。看樣子陶百川的意見就可通過了。然而又是出人意料的，戴着老花鏡模樣有些像老學究的瞿銊站了起來。</p>
<p>他說他反對陶的意見，這種意見他認為是舊式官僚不負責任的作風。他說正因為我們曉得接收敵僞物資有問題，正因為清查團的工作沒有什麽結果，所以我們要派人去參加，去看看到底是怎麽一回事！</p>
<p>瞿銊的話也有相當道理，參議員們的情緒顯然紊亂了，附議他的人也有，這時候詹文滸站起又加以補充：</p>
<p>詹說：「接收情形的不能令人滿意是事實，清查團對於有些事情比較隔膜，要認真清查必須要有真正明瞭內情的人。所以我主張要末不接受清查團的邀請，要接受則選派一個人去是不夠的，我們要派五個人至七個人去，認真的查一查」。</p>
<p>路式導的意見更進一步了，他說：「我們要末不過問接收的事情，要查就一定要查出個結果來。但是，清查團的辦法是中央規定的，我們派人去還是要受節制，他們要東就東，要西就西，一定信舊得不到結果，所以我主張要查就呈請政府讓我們參議會自己來查」。</p>
<p>時間已經五點三刻了，議長宣佈說，現在有四種不同的意見，因為時間關係，留待明天上午再付表決。在散會之前陶百川又補充了一點，他請潘議長在明天這問題付表決以前，先向清查團詢問兩點：第一，清查團到底還有多少時間的壽命？第二，清查團邀請參議會派人參加，性質是否僅處於協助地位？</p>
<h3>欲與世界爭長短　尚待苦幹二十年　張維報告衛生　認為清除舞弊須先養廉</h3>
<p>下午三時，續開第四次會議。參議員候　遠提議，取消各局長之口頭報告，以節省時間。但姜懷素起立稱，口頭報告仍需要，唯不　誦讀書面報告，而須補書面報告之不足。潘議長乃發表聲明稱，此事與大會議程有關，且已通知各局長出席報告，故口頭報告仍應有，但須補書面報告之不足，且不可超過一小時。</p>
<p>於是，由衛生局長張維氏報告。張局長謂，上海人口在四百萬以上，衛生工作極感繁重，接任八十餘日中，不僅夫有建樹，甚至連門徑也未摸熟，大半時間耗於搜尋病源及就會臨時問題，治本之道，近始進行，各人雖比苦幹，終以條件缺乏，建樹無多，市庫空虛，處境艱難。</p>
<p>目前，爭取物質經費，技術與時間，固極迫切，而心理建設更為要緊。貪婪，剝削，矇蔽，詐欺，頹廢，萎靡，驕奢，淫佚種種惡習，皆足以阻撓工作之進展。</p>
<p>當然，此亦有其外在原因，即待遇菲薄，不足維持生活。試問清道夫月入九萬餘元，如何過活？又如本局護士薪津，每月不過二十萬元。而特別護士，每日所入即有五萬元。故欲求弊絕風清，必須提高待遇，俾能養廉。</p>
<p>吾人試思，何以戰前舞弊之事較少？何以明知有此弊端，而不公開？或以適當方式，使不法行為變為合法？</p>
<p>當務之急，應厲行心理建設，再進而爭取物質條件。二十年後，必可與世界其他大都市爭一短長？</p>
<p>本人今日所談，並非工作報告，而是表明態度。請參議員諸公有所指正。要清除舞弊，必須安定生活，要做事，必須先有工具，故必須有錢，且必須有充分時間，完成工作。　　　　　　　，張局長　匆匆結束，由宣局長答覆質詢。</p>
<p>至於衛生局書面工作報告，包括：調整　　　　，實　　幹部；聯合　　力量，　　　　設施。借　　　　工具，　善街道清潔等十項。並　錄　　有關工作數位。</p>
<h3>四人雀戰不算賭博　跑狗跑馬一律取締　不肖員警藉端勒索確未根絕　宣局長口頭答覆議員質詢</h3>
<p>各參議員向警察局提出之書面質問共八十四件，宣局長逐一口頭答覆，中間曾休息十分鍾，最後復因時間不夠，尚餘若干件改用書面。昨日答復之主要內容如下：（一）吸毒販毒案件，正嚴厲緝捕，並希望人民檢舉協助。現有烟犯六千餘人，已戒除者僅數百人，實因調騐所規模太少之故，現擬呈請市府撥款添辦並與衛生局合作，希望於兩年內肅清。</p>
<p>（二）關於不肖警士藉端勒索等事確未根絕，此風當然要整頓，亦望人民檢舉。（三）交通方面，現有交通警八八八名，依各十字路口之情形酌置安置一至六人。但根本困難仍在馬路狹窄，車輛太多，且大多不守規則。至於裝設自動管制之紅綠燈目前經費上尚無此能力。（四）娼妓問題，現祗能先從公娼着手，勒令登記檢騐後發給執照，至於私娼當然仍嚴令取締。（五）關於取締賭博，若干地方均已破除情面執行，但四人雀戰民法規定不算賭博，故如非修改法律，否則無法執行。其他如回力球跑狗跑馬等現亦在取締之列。（六）最近實施之管理舊貨商店辦法，對於破獲竊案極有幫助。（七）關於警局編製，現警員尚未足額，真正刑事警察僅五千餘人，有人謂警局職員太多，事實上並非職員多，乃警察太少，希望在三年內逐步補充。（八）接收僞警局之財産物資均有詳細清冊，內槍枝共九千七百餘枝。（十）警局自辦子弟學校，有人質問為封建思想之表現，事實上因目前本市學校不夠，同時為減低警員負擔，實係提倡教育云。</p>
<p>（職業普查結果　有業者佔百分之四十弱）</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕市警察局舉辦本市職業普查，結果計有業者一·五四九·四九四人，佔總人口百分之三九·一一（全市總人口三·九六二·〇六四人，其中男性二，三三一·二二四人，女性一，六三〇·八四〇人）內男性一，三〇四·〇九三人，女性二四五·四〇一人。職業類別：農業，男七五·九二二人，女四六·三〇〇人。礦業，男一·八九七人，女二·二一七人。工業，男三七四·八八八人女七四·六二六人商業，男五五九·八一三人，女四二·八五九人。交通運輸業男八八·九二〇人，女一四·九八九人。工務員，男八二·二〇九人，女一二·七二九人，自由職業，男三九·二〇一人，女八·四〇七人。人事服務，男五九·八〇六人，女四九·三四四人。其他，男二一·四三七人，女三·二〇七人。</p>

<h3>英商電車損失過重　許多計劃暫難實施</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市交通擁擠，公共車輛之缺少，實為主因之一。記者頃自英商電車公司當局方面探悉：該公司電車，在敵僞時期損壞極為嚴重，故電車之行駛數量，較戰前為少。六路　路，因鐵軌一部份被拆，尚難恢復。其他車輛，因年久失修，且戰爭八年來，橡皮胎輪迄未更換，致十八，二十各路無軌電車，大量抛停站內，十七路無軌電車，亦僅少數應市，與法商對開之議，因車輛難與相等而擱淺。聞橡皮胎輪，該公司已向英倫預定，可分三批抵埠，第一批於本月內即可運達，裝配後，停駛各綫，或可提前恢復。至於着鍾路與靜安寺路南北鐵軌銜接，有待該段馬路放寬後進行，本年內恐難實現。</p>

<h3>張莘夫案兇手　莫廣成一席話</h3>
<p>— 本報八月廿七日瀋陽航訊　特派記者凜風</p>
<p>接收史上的血迹</p>
<p>張莘夫的鮮血，染印了東北接收史上開頭的一頁。</p>
<p>是在東北光復的初期，一月上旬的季節，正是「冰天雪地」「寒風凜冽」的時候，一列專車，載着中央派遣到東北來的工礦接收人員，汽笛嗚嗚，開向撫順，準備接收　順的煤礦。</p>
<p>當時的撫順和從瀋陽到撫順的鐵路綫，大部份控制在共軍的手裏，專車裏坐着，張莘夫先生，以及隨着張先生前往撫順的其他工礦接收人員，此外還有些路警，事前曾經得到了蘇軍的安全保證。</p>
<p>這列專車僥倖的開到了撫順，但是因爲情形不對，張等要求專車開回瀋陽，車至至中途李石寨車站，慘劇發生了，張莘大和他的八個同伴，被共軍用刀刺穿胸膛，張氏身上刀傷十八處其他人員都是同樣的隨着張氏殉了難。　張莘夫以及其他殉難人員的屍體，在雪地上停放了好幾天，叫附近的村人觀覽，守護的共軍，吿訴村人說：「他是大漢奸，該死不該死？」大家必定要設一聲：「該死」，然後離去，李石寨一帶居民，現在還時常講述當時的悽慘情景。</p>
<p>事隔八月，張莘夫等飲恨長眠，寃抑未伸，停柩在瀋陽關帝廟裏，到了今天，居然竟把當時執行的共軍「遼東軍區第八旅廿二團三營七連長連」莫廣成捕獲，歷經錦州，瀋陽軍法審訊，莫犯侃侃而談，直供不諱，但他附帶聲明他是執行共軍當局命令，同時他也並未親自動手。</p>
<p>兇手投進了法網</p>
<p>莫廣成押禁在瀋陽的第三監獄裏，記者得到了長官部的允准，坐着汽車，跑了二十幾里路，大北邊門外的寬敞大街，配合着兩列大樹，風光是很恬靜的，一座漆着保護彩色的建築物，矗立在眼前，那就是我們的目的地。</p>
<p>記者隨着引導的衛兵上了樓，兩排門窗相對的房屋，閃進了眼簾，衛兵喊了一聲「莫廣成」，迎頭的第一號房間，馬上傳出了一聲「有」團答聲音未了，鐵窗的欄桿上露出了一個小夥子的身形，手拉着欄桿，臉貼在鐵欄上，以疑惑的眼色，看着走　前來的記者們。</p>
<p>「我們是來訪你的新聞記者」，記者把身份說明了，他以苦笑而帶着期待的表情，應付了這塲面。</p>
<p>監舍的構築，是日本式的地板草　上，舖着不完整的行李，大家行走起臥，都在這日本式的「榻榻密」上，門窗連接在榻邊、光綫空氣還算充足，飲食仍　沿襲着　滿時代的定量和辦法，據說瀋陽的監獄，以道個監獄算一最好，因爲日人在這裏也監禁過日本的罪犯。</p>
<p>這時莫廣成，已被提出監舍，隨着大家走出樓門，來在陽台上，坐上了短牆頭，開始了談話。不知什麽情景使他難過，當着我竟模簌簌的落下了淚來，他用黑汗衫拭過了淚水，叙述他的家庭狀况說：「我是河北遵化縣鐵廠鎭下格莊人，現年廿四歲，幼年因父母偏愛，未讀過書，蘆溝橋事變後，八路軍到達了家門，四個哥哥，都參加了八路，大哥，二哥和四哥，先後陣亡，三哥不知去向」。</p>
<p>悲壯殉難的經過</p>
<p>關於張莘夫死難情形的談話開始了。</p>
<p>有人問道：「張莘夫先生，死得太慘了，中國工礦界少了一個能幹的伙伴，國家損失了一個人才，他身上的刀傷，死後並未閉上的眼睛，到現在還盤旋在大家的腦際，當時你怎忍心勸得手？」莫廣成說：「當時是奉命行事，但我未動手刺殺的時候，是排長和弟兄們幹的，我在遠遠的望着。」</p>
<p>於是他描繪當時情景說：「張莘夫所乘的火車，是一等專車，當由瀋陽開向撫順的時候，車過深井子（當時由深井子站起，由共軍控制。）當地的駐軍第一營第一連，曾用紅旗勸吿該車停止，但火車却不肯停（按當時瀋陽蘇軍曾勸吿張氏謂：沿途不靜，萬勿停車），故曾開槍射擊，常我駐防李石寨，曾接第一連的電話，說火車已離深井子，要我馬上拘押該車，但是電話還沒有停止，火車已通過我駐防的地方，後來旅團部有命令來說：「火車向潘陽開回的時候，一定要把該車拘押，並將車中各人，加以逮捕，違則軍法從事。並且各旅團長爲了此事，整日駕車奔走各站，監督各部隊，我也因此幾天沒睡覺，後來聽說該車已不再回來，大家才放鬆了一些。</p>
<p>有一天，　日子忘了，午後約在九時左右，保安旅副司令劉子義抵李石寨車站，當時我因有要事已往營部，劉副司令則對駐在車站的排長陳桂東說：「接收撫順煤礦的火車，即將開回，車中並有八路軍的郭政委，與蘇軍的少校　名字不曉得，（聞因此事後亦被殺）以及蘇軍士兵若干名同行，命陳排長把張莘夫所帶的人員加以逮捕。</p>
<p>當我從營都回來的時候，張莘夫及其隨員八名，已被綁在車站，大衣已被脫去，只穿着便衣，當時蘇軍已乘火車溜之大吉，把保護張莘大等之責任，完全推却不理。</p>
<p>後來劉副司令就命我把張莘夫綁到野外約距車站二華里的南山坡去，郭政委同樣的命令着我，同時還說張莘大是大漢奸，若撫順煤礦被國民黨接收以後，八路軍就沒有辦法，我爲了他們不是我直屬長官，同時此命令又不知是否確實？以後若根究起來，我可負責不了，故我不肯執行，劉副司令派一名警衛兵，强迫我把張莘夫殺死，我在威迫之下，只得將張莘夫等綁至南山坡，命令我的士兵，用刺刀將他們殺死，張莘夫在死前默無一語，若無其事，然態度極强硬，其隨員却像一些可憐虫，在哀求不要殺死他們！</p>
<p>夕陽影裏的懺悔</p>
<p>這椿事件發生以後，我曾到營部報吿，營部沒說什麼，第二天劉副司令特把我叫到撫順去，加以安慰，接着是蘇軍把我找去問話，押了四十多天，然後又把我放了出來。</p>
<p>找到了隊伍，從南調到北，不久又從北調到南，心中感到了厭倦，國為我心裏有感慨：過去，是對日本人作戰，現在，是自己人打仗，所以不願意打了，同時也因爲我想家，我想回家去，有些人和我有同感，所以同時開了小差，一共廿幾個人，因為走的一不合法，同行的人大都在半路被八路軍衝散了。</p>
<p>跑到了西豐，曾用李德義的名字，向縣投誠，打算給國家効力，可是爲了回家，於是又走了，在路上向鄕人打聽家鄉情形，結果是不能回去，因爲家中還是八路軍的天下，我這樣不合法的跑回去，那結果是不會有好結局的。</p>
<p>主意不定，又跑到了葫蘆島，住在我那一連上士文書趙培雲家裏，爲了維持生活，把手錶賣了，得法幣五萬元。拿這筆錢經營紙烟小生意，幹了十多天，結果被駐軍逮捕了；八年來的八路軍生活，至此纔吿一段落。</p>
<p>有人問他：「在葫蘆島是否爲了做工作？」他眼圈又紅了，含着淚說：「共軍派我這個不識字的人做什麽？」反駁他的人說：「你不是受過共軍的敎育麼？」他說：「受的敎育很有限。我所說的，可以說句句都是實話，沒有半點虛假，我可以發誓，要說假話，死的時候，必挨炸子。」</p>
<p>夕陽在天，他和記者們結束了談話，感慨的說：「我錯了，或殺或留，希望來個痛快。」同時他也一再的要求記者在長官面前「美言美言」，意思是替他說一些好話，軍法處的表示，是調集證據後再說。</p>
<p>歸途，腦海裏被兩個悽慘的景象糾纏着：一個是滿身刀傷而死尚未瞑目的張莘夫，一個是當時執行殘酷命令的兇手莫廣成！</p>

<p>編輯先生：鄙人是省立某中學高中學生，家父是薪金階級的公務人員，弟兄三人，均在求學時代，家中除免强開支外，無多餘儲蓄。弟姊皆在私立中學求學，因學費昂貴，故請求市敎貸金，我因在省立中學，學費低廉，故未去求貸金。豈知今日收到繳費單，雜膳費即近十九萬（第一期膳費八萬，尊師金五萬，水電費二萬五，損失準備金一萬等），被單二條二萬元，名爲省立中學，雜費如此高昂，薪水階級的公務人員子弟，如何可以求學？（程明）</p>
<p>郵員調職待遇不公</p>
<p>許多郵局局員或海蘭關員等，由滬局或滬關調往外埠辦公，如該員家屬衆多，於目前交通困難，搬家費用驚人，眞是一件逼死人的事！因爲公敎人員淸苦，盡人皆知，故勢難　家前往，祇能獨自或一部隨往，今拿一個賺底薪二百元的來講，如在滬辦公，共可支薪津二十九萬四千元，（底薪二百元乘生活指數七百二十倍，加基本數拾五萬）用以贍家養口，已感拮据萬狀，一旦調往外埠，以甘肅，雲南爲例，則反只能支薪十三萬二千元，（滬地一半不到）（乘生活指數二百六十倍，加基本數六萬元）以此供兩地開銷，勢非凍餒不可，有失鼓勵服務邊陲之旨。况現在匯水極大，匯兌時間極慢，爲此籲請當局，對此項人員，恢復戰前郵局海關辦法，即「如須兩地開銷，則可支生‘活費用較高地薪津」例以示政府憐恤服務邊陲公務員淸苦之德意，郵局海關如能恢復戰前各地薪津一律之辦法，則允所　企也。（胡　光）</p>
<p>重　　　　往往　路　　　　　　　　　　　　　出外嬌物　父　又出外辦公時，忽來一衣防　短衫褲之人，乎挾公事包一只，及簿册一疊，狀似上等商人，向母親推銷名爲「房租收據」之　子，（見附件）每本一千元，自稱某委員會某律師辦公處所派出，强欲推銷十本，母親不允，彼以種種言語相　，說有了這　，房屋糾紛，即可解決。母親信以爲眞，即付彼洋一萬元，而彼僅給九本了事，直至我回家，才發覺爲無用廢物，母親聞知，悲痛萬分，（因父親月入僅二十餘萬也），待去追時，已杳如黃鶴，該書反面，印有著作人姚雲摶律師，出版者大衆出版社，事屬欺騙，爲特懇請貴報予以披露，請有關治安當局，及各界注意，免再發生類似情形。（陸寳傳）</p>
<p>地獄邊緣的吶喊聲</p>
<p>啓東自從被共軍侵入後，帶來了很多新花樣：（一）每人抵準有五百步地皮，多下的都要送給他們去分配，這樣可得紅旗一面說是光榮的，吾則拿到的是綠旗，白旗，這　是羞辱，（二）秋季公糧的征收，總數爲六　認　，啓東全人口不過卅萬　　　算算每我要負　多少？（三）　勵寡婦再曦，閩女生孩，所謂社會道德已經完全被「解放」了。（四）政府官員的家屬固然要殺，流亡的難民也要殺，爲的是爲什麽不和他們合作？（五）「解放區」的乞丐是要先到區政府去登記的，取得登記證，然後方可沿戶行乞，這兩天，從啓東繼續流亡，到崇明去的難民，已經超過了五千多人，沒有別的希望，祗期待能够早些踏回自由的鄉土！</p>
<p>南通倒店風潮裏因</p>
<p>編輯先生：竊吾南通自七月以來，各商號倒閉停業者達數十家之多，鬧得滿城風雨，商塲秩序大爲紊亂。緣有安徽人洪某，開設天成德菸號于城內東大街，歷有年所，營業亦頗暢吒，乃邇來大肆吞吸拆票，卒於七月三日忽吿倒閉，並有律師的受任淸理通吿，貼上板門，淸理結果，欠債一萬七千五百萬元，僅將所存之四千餘萬貨値，照成數攤派，祗攤般十分之二五成。債權人以流亡難民居多，處于一切無可奈何的境地下，莫不徒呼負責，面以不了而了之。自從天成德這樣的淸理結束後，即日起一來　收拆票之奸商之存心不良，目諸此情此景，無不　　是計之善，咸認機會難得，于是　踵也似的紛紛倒閉矣，雖亦曾經當局之密切注意，然從未聞有受過嚴厲處分及法律制裁的，且均能逍遙法外，面團團享用不盡，故傚允愈熾，迄仍朱戢刁風，此乃整個社會問題，若再不連予以嚴厲之處置，則他日之演變，不知將伊於胡底？希經濟財政當局注意及之！（洪乾坤）</p>

<p>1營口　去年十月底中蘇開始商談國軍依約接收東北，定在營口登陸，十一月四日杜聿明將軍一度來此部署，終因蘇方之干擾及共軍潛入侵據，致使國軍登陸受阻，後共軍在沿海構築工事，成爲由關內增援來東北之主要港口。</p>
<p>2遼西走廊　去年十一月十七日山海關一戰，杜聿明將軍所部國軍東北保安隊進入東北，沿北寗路迅速推進，二十五日進駐錦州，即分三路展開：左翼於十二月二十九日人熱河；右翼一月九日一度入營口；正面於本年一月十五日抵瀋陽郊區，屯皇姑屯及北大營。</p>
<p>3空運長春　去年十一月底長春會談，政府與蘇方商討國軍空運東北之技術問題，曾獲協議，惟中經一度挫折，十二月中旬，中蘇再繼續商談軍事聯絡事宜，迄本年一月五日，首批國軍始行降落長春接防，十二日一部入駐四平街。</p>
<p>4瀋陽接防　三月七日起瀋陽蘇軍突開始北移，事前並未作何通知，其行動撲朔迷離，情况極度混亂，共軍乃乘幾舌躍，佔東大營及北陵，並侵人市內，十一日國軍入城接防，南郊渾河南岸一度激戰，至十三日秩序始漸恢復。</p>
<p>5遼北亂局　三月九日至十四日間遼北蘇軍絡續移調北上，各地情勢混沌不堪，共軍先後　陷梨樹·開源·昌圖·鐵嶺·十七日入四平街，中長路長春以南交通完全斷絕，國軍新一軍於十七日越瀋陽沿鐵路緩緩北進，接收主權。</p>
<p>6長春之戰　三月十九日起長春蘇軍開始撤離，情况不寗，四月二日共軍結集外圍，開始襲擊市郊，城內國軍陷入重圍，外援斷絕，經孤軍苦鬥半月，十六日市區發生混戰，十八日終吿失守。</p>
<p>7四平街之戰　四月十七日新一軍進抵四平街前綫，兩軍主力接觸，展開大戰，雙方動員兵力總計達十五萬人，共產軍主力分布於四平街。公主嶺一綫，圖作頑抗以阻止國軍北上，國軍於正面市區與之相持對戰，同時以一部迂迴推進至公主嶺山地，側擊四平街之背，並擴展兩翼攻遼源海龍，作大鉗形運動，五月十七日右翼西豐主力遭遇戰，共產軍全軍崩潰，勢呈動搖，正面國軍續加緊壓力，於十九日進入四平街，此一大戰經三十二日之火熾爭奪後，至此乃吿結束。</p>
<p>8本溪胡之戰　三月中新六軍由瀋陽南下，沿中長綫及安瀋綫兩路推進，四月初分別進抵海城及本溪，五月初共產軍沿安瀋綫北窺，圖襲瀋陽以策應陷於膠着之四平街戰事，五月二日本溪湖一戰，共軍主力十萬潰散，從此引退長白山地不能復振。</p>
<p>9北路掃蕩戰　四平街戰後，東北共軍戰鬥序列已烏獸散，紛紛北退興安嶺山地，並在松花江北岸及長哈鐵道沿錢佈防，主力集結於齊齊哈爾要塞，松花江南無復大戰。國軍由四平街全面北上，分五路進行掃蕩，左翼先後到達遼源，雙山，農安之綫；正面五月廿三日入長春，兩路續向哈爾濱及吉林疾進，東路廿八日入永吉，六月四日駐拉法，五日右翼兩路會師曄甸；正面新一軍於五月三十日取窰門抵松花江畔，共軍炸中長路大橋，阻止國軍前進，六月六日國軍渡哈市南七十五里處之松花江口天塹，在陶賴昭建立橋頭堡，七日東北停戰令到達各綫國軍均遵令停止前進。</p>
<p>10遼東半島之戰　當北路國軍正以秋風掃落葉之勢進行描蕩之際，遼東共產軍爲牽掣起見，乃由山東增援在莊河登陸，集結於岫岩一帶，五月廿四日起三路突襲中長路，佔領鞍山圍海城及大石橋，後經國軍反攻，予以粉碎，共軍遂退竄千山以東中韓邊境山岳帶，戰事於六月六日結束。</p>
<p>11拉法之戰　六月七日共產軍違反停戰令，在東北前綫四處進攻，林彪傾巢猛犯拉法國軍陣地，側擊老爺嶺，十二日侵陷拉法新舊站，國軍撤往大小孤家子之綫，迄十四日，共軍退出拉法，國軍亦未進駐。</p>
<p>12廟羣島　六月十七日國軍艦隊在長山八島海面巡邏，以監視共產軍經渤海海峽偸往東北之路綫，至廿二日各艦陸續返防。</p>
<p>13大連與旅順　按中蘇友好同盟條約：大通爲自由港三十年；旅順爲共用海軍基地三十年。五月廿二日東北蘇軍總司令馬林諾夫斯基宣布東北蘇軍於五月三日撤竣，實則此地區仍在其軍事佔據中。</p>
<p>14目前接觸地　自東北停戰令頒布後，除拉法一役外，東北前綫大致沉寂無事，僅間或有零星接觸。目前共產軍又在蠢蠢欲動，向松花江前綫陶賴昭增援，並砲擊國軍橋頭陣地；同時鐵嶺三面被圍；法庫亦受攻擊，惟經國軍馳援淸剿後，形勢仍極穩定。（陳先霖繪）</p>

<p>上海市營業稅　十五日移交財局　征課手續商會切盼改進　利得稅兩種同時進行中　　〔本報訊〕本市營業稅，改由市財政局接辦，業經財政局與直接稅局商定於十月十五日正式移交，所有自七月一日起應征之秋季營業稅，歸由財政局征收，其夏季營業稅，直接稅局方面，尚未辦了事宜，亦概由財政經濟繼續接辦，並聞直接稅局過去辦理營業稅人員，一部份亦移交財政局任用，以資熟手，市商會方面對於財政局接辦後，盼於征課手續等能更多改進，以便商民云。　　去年所利得稅　難副政府期望　　本市三十四年度所利得稅，自經直接稅署樓主任來滬督催後，市商會及本市直接稅局，均積極趕辦，綜計市商會所轄各業公會二百七十七業，商店會員二十三家，合計三百單位，截止九月五日止，已向商會申報者達二百三十七單位，其中有一部份，聞已逕報直接稅局，據市商會稅務委員會方面透露消息，照申報數目，稅額均甚有限，因三十四年度八月以前尚在敵偽時期，如米，麵，紗，布，煤，鐵，五金等等，均受嚴格統制，且以電力統制　嚴，無法生產，營業既少，純益自低，勝利以還，舉凡原料，燃料，交通等，均尚在復原伊始，未得充沛暢達，又以偽幣二百折一，各業原來之帳面虛盈，亦大打折扣，市商會稅務委員會，以直接稅局方面，對於所利得稅預算，期望甚大，而三十四年度各業實際營業又如此不振，深為焦慮，現在正在漏夜趕算已報各單位之營業額，及盈餘額，以便於本星期內，造成統計，提請有關方面參考，又聞財政部直接稅署，對於本市三十四年度所利得稅，非常重視，聞王署長不久亦將親自來滬，與工商界負責人商討征課辦法云，再市商會稅務委員會，對已報調查表之各單位，擬印發證件，以資識別，至未報者，仍望趕速申報云。　　特種過份利得　本月開始徵收　　上海直接稅局對本市特種過份利得稅徵收範圍及稅率，業經規定，並於九月份起開始，稽征範圍，（一）金融業（銀行錢莊銀號銀公司企業公司保險公司信託公司等皆屬之），（二）買賣業（凡運銷工業製成品及農產品者屬之），（三）製造業（凡工業製造改製者皆是），（四）居問商如代理代辦經紀人等屬之。（五）營造業（如營造廠與建築公司等），至對營業資本總額外利得所收稅率如下，（一）利得未超過百分之五百者徵收其盈餘額七分之一左右，（二）利得超過百分之五百者征百分之六十，納稅人包括國營及民營但有關教育，文化，公益，慈善等事業，如以其利得之數仍用於該事業中者得免稽征云。透支應行覓保　錢業遵令實行　　本市銀號各行莊，對於存戶透支，過去均具辦保證手續，現已於本月開始實行，照章簽約，茲悉前所透支款項，截至中秋節前，已全部收回，如須繼續透支者，一律另訂新約及覓具妥保。毛絨紡織業　求緩征貨物稅　　吾國毛絨紡織廠製造之各種粗細呢絨，在國貨界中早有地位，抗戰期內，各廠因原料及動力關係，開工者寥寥無幾，微弱之基礎，幾至一蹶不振，勝利以後，各廠正待復興，初以工潮迭起，待遇提高，成本激增，銷路呆滯，繼因舶來品源源而來，價廉物美，難與競爭，以致各廠無不焦頭爛額，頗有維持乏術，關廠無方之感，自貨物稅條例公佈以後，毛綫毛織品，均須征稅百分之十五，其範圍之廣，稅率之高，絕非各廠所能勝任，聞已函請市商會，轉呈有關當局請予暫緩征收，并定於本月十四日召集臨時會員大會，討論應付辦法，藉維工業云。又有八種公債抽籤　戰前五種戰時三種　除粵債外照章兌付　　民國廿五年統一公債乙種債票，民國十七年金融長期公債，民國廿五年整理廣東金融公債，民國廿五年四川善後公債民國廿六年闢　廣東省港河工程美金公債，民國廿八年建設公債第一期債票，民國廿八年軍需公債第三期債票等八種公債，還本抽籤，九日午前九時，在財政部公債司上海辦事處舉行，審計部，銀錢兩業公會，市商會等，均派員監視。前項債票此次共抽籤支一〇五支，計中籤債票面額國幣一七·五二五·〇〇〇元，美金六〇·〇〇〇元，聞此次中籤債票暨到期息票，除廿六年闢　廣東省港河工程美金公債，因指定該項還本付息基金之粵海關附加稅前被敵劫持，未能照解，本息暫緩兌付，俟該項基金清理完竣，再行另訂恢復償付日期外，其餘各債本息，即依照各該債條例原訂償付日期，由各地中中交農四銀行暨中央信託局辦理兌付手續。　　證交催繳債券證金　　上海證券交易所因債券市場業已佈置就緒，而各經紀人或已申請債券市場，尚未繳保證金者，或尚未申請而欲補行申請者，特分兩各經紀人，請即至所補辦手續，並將保證金現金部份國幣二千萬元於本月十一日中午十二時前，向該所財務處繳清，逾期須待該市場開業六個月後再行通告辦理云。　　黑市昨有北幫買進　　公債昨仍徘徊，七樓某大戶脫售不少，然因五樓北幫來進，尚堪支持，統丙成開二三五〇元，曾盤高至二七八〇元，始告回降，降落至二二八〇元，復呈盤旋，結果較前收計甲乙升五十元，丙種跌五十元，丁種軋升一〇〇元，統戊亦好起五〇元。在嚴密管制下　金價不易變動　昨日金鈔均微跌　　烚赤連日小漲，昨稍見回，央行管制稍嚴，中途甚疲，晨開二一五萬，央行施加壓力，即自二一五萬五起逐步盤跌，央行配給一七七條，價二一四萬，十時後境況日非，近午見低至二一一萬七始告平穩，午刻微回至二一三萬，午後續形微穩，結果較前收跌一萬一，飾金念二萬七，紋銀銀元均平，暗拆因秋節關係，銀根稍緊，息價自一角半至一角八不等。　　外幣亦告轉疲，美鈔自晨初三四五〇元起，即遭賣戶所包圍，中途竟盤跌至三三八〇元，始得維持，午刻在三四〇〇元光景徘徊午後賡續微進，結果較前收續挫三十元，對黃金之比價為六二四元左右，對十兩，港票初平　疲，自七〇〇元起退至六九〇元左右，結果微挫五元，港匯亦初穩後疲，最後在六七五元至六八五元，印匯八三〇元至八四〇元，英匯一一二〇〇元有售，美匯少變。中秋菜蔬激漲　　昨為夏曆中秋佳節，歷時物品一致飛漲，尤以菜蔬市價為最，葷菜中如短肋肉每斤售至二千五百元，長肋二千二百元，腿肉三千三四百元，活毛雞每斤三千五百至四千元，鴨每隻三斤重售一萬元，中只八千元，小只五六千元，鮮魚花鰱每斤三千二百元，草魚三千至三千五百元，鯽魚四千四五百元，大黃魚二千元，蝦四五千元，素菜毛豆每斤四五百元，芋艿四百五十元至六百元，青菜亦昂至每斤五百五十元，各菜販不利市三倍。中秋節安然渡過　銀錢業破例不休假　　中秋節昨已在穩靜中渡過，當日銀錢兩業交換票據為五二一一二張，交換總額僅一二五，四〇五，八二二，〇〇〇元，比平時最高額減低五百萬萬元左右，因金融方面應解款項已在中秋前夕歸清，應轉賬者亦手續辦妥，市場方面交易自平日清淡，舊式商店一時仍難打破傳統習慣，據業中人云，今日銀根不致十分抽緊，因市場慣例，每逢銀錢業休假，翌日收付自必增多，銀根不免隨之跟緊，此次中秋照常營業，保持常態，今日市場當無鉅大影響，據悉，此次銀錢兩業並未休假，因可節省一部份人力物力，然亦造成有史以之創舉云。毛茶搜羅一空　外匯調整之結果　　〔屯溪訊〕本年歙·休·婺源等縣之毛茶，隨大部已為茶商絡續收購，然因絲茶茶商，對今年茶市看法謹慎，與頭寸關係，故尚有少數毛茶，無人購製，依然在茶農手中，最近外匯調整，茶市消息，略見好轉，乃紛紛入鄉採辦，各地所剩毛茶隧完全由農入商，成一掃光之現象，婺源所存毛茶，亦於三日之內售空。證交試拍聲中　華股場外交易大減　結果大股跌而小股漲　　華股昨因證交試拍，各號停歇場外者甚多，交易更少，熱門大股仍難見俏，反之小熱及冷門各股均有進展，各股差度續在軋平趨勢中，最初熱門大股站高價，小股則尚平，嗣後即逐漸背道而馳，大股步跌，小股則競進上游，結果較前收計永紗回挫少許，美亞平平，景福新光勤與各漲半成強，較冷各股普遍進展少許，元老股平穩而已。　　外股仍以錢業怡啤兩者上市消息更濃而續漲，餘者仍難支持，都見回跌，結果在交易清稀下，計怡啤紙業續告微升，怡紗會德豐業廣亞洲均告微降，鋼業英聯續挫半成強。證交通告　上市證券繳費辦法　經紀人登廣告辦法　　〔本報訊〕據悉：證交當局頃已通函各上市證券之發行公司，即日起，繳納證券之上市費用。照證交暫定辦法，每股微收上市費用一角。如將來部令對此暫定辦法有變更時，再行增收或退還。　　又證交當局，頃諭各個人經紀人，如欲在各種報章刊載廣告時，務須注明證交經紀人之號數，及經紀人之姓名，切勿單以證券公司之名義出面，以杜流弊。法人經紀人則不在此限。外埠申請食糖　台糖公司酌配　　配價由今日審議會決定　　〔本報訊〕頃據台糖公司負責人語記者稱：第十二期配糖時，外埠用戶之申請數額，竟超過十一萬包，核與實際消費數量，似不相符，故並未照配。茲社會局為體恤商艱起見，已將各外埠用戶之申請文件，轉送台公糖司，決准於本月十二十三兩日辦理第十三期食糖申請時，同時亦將此項外埠用戶之申請予以酌配，至配售價格，則將遵照今日糖價審議會所訂之價格辦法，酌量配售云。秋繭貨欵辦法決定　各地繭行廿日左右可開秤　　本屆蘇浙皖三省秋繭貨欵，業經中央銀行與中國農民銀行中國蠶絲公司及第三區繅絲工業同業公會分別會商，經決定辦法要點如次，（一）估計全部貸款約需一百五十億元，由中國農民銀行承貸，（二）凡本年息借春繭貨各廠商，經營合理，確遵貸款辦法者，及絲車數在八十部以上之新廠商，均得申請貸款，（三）春繭貸款廠商應繳墊頭，得按收購秋繭數量，將春繭貸款之墊頭移充，新申請貸款各廠商應按貸款比例繳付三成墊頭，（四）貸款利息暫定月息二分五厘，（五）由中國農民銀行與中國蠶絲公司合組貸款管理處管理貸款之核放運用及質押品處理等事宜，（六）凡申請貸款各廠商，限九月十五日以前，向博物院路八十八號六樓貸款管理處登記，經會商核定後，即訂約貸放，日內各絲廠商已紛紛向貸款處登記，週內即可全部訂約，預計本月二十日起，各地繭行可先後開秤云。證交市場演習的第一天　從業員都充滿了新奇和歡悅的情緒　　〔本報特寫〕千呼萬喚始出來的上海證券交易所，前天才演出一番轟轟烈烈的揭幕禮後，昨天上下午又緊接着演習交易交割和對帳的手續。演習結果，還不能到達「逼真」的階段。假使十二日准定正式開拍，恐怕交易手續不能得到預期的熟練。　　嶄新的設備　喧囂的聲浪　　這次主持證交的首腦人物，都是飽學經驗之士。所以證交的一切設計和措施，都有它學理上和現實上的根據。自證交的大幕揭開後，人人都刮目相看，處處的感覺是新穎，特別是市場上交易櫃等新設置，和交割對帳新制度的樹立，在我國却都是些劃時代的創作。然而也唯其因為過於新穎和超特，才發生了昨天不熟練和生硬的鏡頭！　　記者趕到市場，交易早已開始，可是門禁怪森嚴，記者終於在證交協理楊蔭溥的領導下走入市場，門啓處，直撲耳膜的是喧豗的叫賣聲，和嘈雜的電話鈴聲。廝混一片！位居中排的六隻交易櫃，和東西兩邊廊裏經紀人電話櫃，都是一團團黑壓壓的人頭。整個的交易，像是怒潮在奔騰和澎湃！　　分配交易櫃填寫小塲帳　　二十隻上市證券，分配在六隻交易櫃上。正中的九號和十號兩櫃，搭配了華廠，中國內衣，統益紗廠，和永安紗廠等六隻股票。這兩櫃週圍的經紀人最為擁擠。其他七號八號兩櫃，搭配了大中華火柴，永安公司，中國水泥，景福，五和織造，大通紗廠等七隻股票。還有十一號十二號兩櫃，搭配了景綸，信和紗廠，中紡紗廠，華豐搪瓷，新光內衣，麗安百貨，榮豐紗廠等七隻股票。　　交易都是在交易櫃外圍進行的。經紀人接到了客戶的委託，買進或賣出某股若干，均須到此指定的交易櫃，察看市面情形。交易進行時，除口喊外，尚應輔以伸手。買進手掌向內，賣出手掌向外。買賣成交後，由賣方經紀人逐筆將種類，數量，價格，及買賣雙方經紀人的號數，並其年月日，製就「小塲帳」。一式四份，投進指定交易櫃上特設的箱隻裏，由證交隨時收集。其餘兩副張，由買賣雙方，各執一紙，作為存根。　　每隻交易櫃裏，都有一個場務員，拿着電話筒站候着。每筆買賣成交時，場務員立刻將成交價格，向電話筒傳報。這具電話，直通東西廊兩端的記錄員。每端有記錄員三人，每人主管二三隻股票行市。聽到成交價格後，立刻寫到黑板上。廊裏的各經紀人的電話生，隨時可把各股的成交價格，和自己的營業所取得聯絡。營業所有事和在場的經紀人或代理人接洽時，電話生只要一按電鈕，場裏正中特設的一排經紀人信號燈，就會有一隻發亮，藉以通知所喊的經紀人。　　單報成交價客戶不對胃　　昨天上午演習交易的結果，一般經紀人的意見，認為證交與報成交價格，而不報買進賣出價格交易既慢，而對某股在某一時間內買價賣價究為若干，又無法探悉，實在不合客戶牌胃。場務員將成交價格報出時，實際上交易櫃外的喊價，早已變了樣，使各經紀人對客戶限價買賣，都感到難於着手。而熱門股交易櫃外，因經紀人過於擁擠，而秩序紊亂。要秩序好，勢將排班買賣交易，又未免牛步化，一方面，冷門股各交易櫃，却門可羅雀！　　手續不熟練　賬目軋不攏　　下半天演習交割和對帳手續，證交當局事前曾為此而特地編印證券買賣集體核對辦法，分發各經紀人的會計人員熟讀一番。昨天臨場實習，不知是會計人員們熟語研讀呢，抑還是證交所訂的辦法過於深奧？演習交割對帳手續後，落得個生硬不熟練的下場！各會計人員，似乎都有一籌莫展之苦。結果，二百多家經紀人的交易帳，竟沒有一家軋得攏！　　證交主任秘書華文煜事後向記者說：「昨天下午演習的經過，不很美滿。今天決定全天演習交割和對帳手續。今後的幾天裏，可能是加緊的訓練！」是的，人生最寶貴的體驗，是不斷的學習。何況，聽說這次證交經紀人中，有許多人員，壓根兒就沒參加過這種嘈雜的交易市場。一旦跨進去，竟至彷徨摸錯無從着手交易。這次證交既以嶄新的姿態出現，當然希望各經紀人，也拿最新的腦筋，去接受新的學識和經驗。同時，更希望證交當局，能顧到演習期間所發現的種種瑕疵，加以改進，否則，又何足以與紐約倫敦兩大世界證券交易所，鼎足而三呢？　　規定各種股票成交單位　　據昨日證交消息各股成交單位一百股者有中國絲業美亞綢廠二種，五百股者有大中華火柴，景綸衫襪，統益紗廠，五和織造，榮豐紗廠，中紡紗廠六種，一千股者有中國水泥，中國內衣，華豐搪瓷，永安公司，信和紗廠，新光內衣，景福衫襪，勤興衫襪，新亞藥廠，永安紗廠，麗安百貨，大通紗廠等十二種。</p>

<p>國際知識美國對蘇政策　強硬起來了　美國合眾社弗朗慈著  納譯　　在最近幾星期中，美國的對蘇政策很快地强硬起來了，巴黎和會的發展以及美南事件，更其可以說明這一點。但是可能發生武裝衝突之說，還不足置信，因爲還有許多政治和外交措置可以嘗試的。　　美國對莫斯科態度趨强硬，似爲國內民衆所贊成，若干專家認爲民間的反蘇情緒，其滋長情形比官方還要迅速。　　美國對蘇聯日趨不信任的基本原因，無非是爲了蘇聯對組織和平的種種會議，都採取不可取的態度，同時對於中歐又別具懷抱。　　美國的輿論認爲自從戰勝日本一年以來，蘇聯的外交，目的顯在建立東西兩個體系的「新均勢」，而並不努力爭取全世界的普遍安全，猶如聯合各國在戰時所期望的。同時美國人又深怕蘇聯企岡在以前的民主國家中扶植經濟革命。　　但是一切似乎還沒達到絕望的境地，華府若干外交家正在考慮把外交手續簡單化，藉以减輕目前的種種爭執，因爲在會議中進行冗長而無益的辯論，祗曾增加不安而不足以解決問題，循通常外交途徑交換照會，明白規定問題的困難何在迫使對方說出確走的意見，或許是更簡捷而有效的辦法。　　五年之內　蘇聯不敢作戰　　一般人以爲第三次世界大戰可能來臨的想法，被權威方面認爲不足置信，但是新均勢的理論却日見抬頭。　　蘇聯在戰爭期間和戰後，曾經獲得火量的土地和勢力，至少有一個長時期可以閉關自守。華府方面認爲蘇聯爲了技術方面的問題，至少在五年內不敢從事另一次世界戰爭：（一）在原子彈生產方面她還比不上她可能的敵人，雖然各方都相信蘇聯在該方面也有長足的進步；（二）蘇聯的鋼鐵產址祗及西方國家的四分之一；（三）西方國家空軍的實力依然比蘇聯堅强。　　在另一方面，西方國家也不準備戰爭。美國的傳統政策一向是不侵略的，大部份的人民都認爲有效的外交經濟措置，可以達到世界和平安全的目的。此外，一大部份美國人並沒有忘記在反抗納粹德國的戰爭中，美國和蘇聯是偉大而强有力的盟邦。　　英國似乎也不可能是反對蘇聯的侵略者，巴勒斯担，埃及和印度問題已經够棘手了。　　由於新戰爭在東西國家看來都覺得是不合邏輯的，所以華府的外交觀察家認爲將來的發展，勢必是繼續不斷而堅決的外交鬥爭，直系蘇聯充份明瞭西方國家保持民主政治和限制蘇聯擴張的決心。　　因此，華府方面有人以爲蘇聯領袖應該從速採取某種主動行動，藉以恢復西方國家對蘇聯的信任，不然東西間的隔閡將愈演愈深，而若干政客可能對蘇聯的意向造成新的恐懼，結果使局勢　　嚴重，國際一週多事的歐洲波瀾迭起　東西的分化已成定局  九，九。　　這一週雖是短短的七天，但在國際上却發生了許多令人心悸的事件。不僅可以證明戰後的世界，一時不易獲得和平；而且說明了這多難的世界，天天在風雨飄颻之中。以亞洲而論，印度臨時政府雖由尼赫魯組成，但是回敎聯盟始終不合作，且將採取「直接行動」使印度也面臨內戰的危機；此在伊朗，最近又發生企圖顚覆薩爾泰納政府的陰謀，伊朗這個國家，永遠沒有安息的一天；再講到亞洲阿刺伯各國，因爲猶太人的非法移殖問題，曾引起軒然大波，英國將在倫敦召集圓桌會議，以解決巴勒斯坦問題；但是阿刺伯人不願與猶太人，聚首一堂，因此這個問題，也很難有獲得解決的希望。　　歐洲多難險象環生　　此在歐洲，這一週正是歐洲的多事之秋。希臘舉行公民投票的結果，保皇黨獲得了勝利，全國選民百分之七十五，贊成國王喬治二世返國復辟。在英美看來，當然是一件可喜的事；但在希臘左派，則担不承認這次公民投票的結果；蘇聯輿論界也認爲這次希臘大選，在英美壓迫之下舉行，不能認爲希臘人民的自由意志。因此國際間的矛盾，再加上希臘內部的問題，交織而成爲非常複雜的國際問題，希臘內亂己到了最後關頭使巴爾幹的和平，也感到極大的威脅。　　英蘇衡突愈演愈烈　　希臘公民投票的結果如何，在理論上，本來沒有多大意義，但在實際上，因爲國際背景的錯綜複雜，對於今後國際政局的演變，有莫大的關係。緣因戰後的巴爾幹半島，己成爲斯拉夫民族的天下，碩果僅存的，唯有希臘一國而己。而希臘與南斯拉夫，保加利亞曁阿爾巴尼亞，都有　領土糾葛，幾成爲斯拉夫各國的眼中釘。希臘爲　固地位起見，不得不請求英軍駐在國內以維持國內的秩序，允其要鎭壓國內的左派。蘇聯爲了這事幾次三番的攻擊英軍駐留希臘，足以危害巴爾幹的和平。但是蔡爾達利斯政府對於蘇聯的壓力，始終不肯屈服。這次公民投票的結果，右派獲勝，國王即將返國復辟，蘇聯亦將視希臘爲英國向東南歐洲發展的跳板。所以今後英蘇在巴爾幹的鬥爭將益趨尖銳化了　　我向和會又提要案　　巴黎和會又到了沉悶時期，因爲聯合國大會定於本月廿三日在紐約開會，這兩個重要的國際會議，要不要同時舉行？也就成各國爭論的集點；在英美方面，認爲國際局勢亟待澄淸，應該同時舉行，故反對聯合國大會延期舉行；但是在蘇聯方面，初則要求聯合國大會延期舉行，繼則主張聯合國改在巴黎或日內瓦舉行。雙方爭執不下，法國提出折衷方案，也沒有成立；中國外長王世杰參加討論，也未能打開僵局。　　這一週和會討論的問題，都沒有瑣碎的問題，其中最惹人注目的，要算是我國王外長向對義領土及政治委員會所提出的議案，主張義大利以前的殖民地里比亞，立即宣吿獨立，如不可能，則亦應交聯合國機構託管若干年，然後宣佈獨立。這一個正義的呼聲，引起世界各國的注意與重視。　　殖民地是資本帝國主義時代的產物，也是現代國際間發生糾紛衝突戰爭的一切來源，當戰後的世界，正欲步入和平民主的新時代之際，全世界被壓迫的民族三萬萬人，均應獲得解放，自不待言，故列强是否換受中國的建議，允許里比亞獨立，或於託管若干年後再行獨立，這是列强殖民政策的一大考騐。　　美國重申對德政策　　今日歐洲最重要的問題，厥爲德國問題迄未獲得解決。在去年的波茨坦會議中，雖在原則上成立協議，但是都沒有實行。其後倫敦舉行五國外長會議，旣未討論到德國問題，今年兩次四國外長會議，對於德國問題，也沒有商得一個解決辦法。而德國被英美法蘇四國佔領，分爲四個區域，不啻己被人肢解，不論在經濟上政治上，均不統一，各自爲政，德人的痛苦，急待解除，也是刻不容緩的。美國國務卿貝爾納斯有鑒於斯，爲早日解除德人的痛苦，特別從巴黎前往德國一行，並在斯都伽特城發表演說，重申美國對德政策，要一點有五：（一）主張德國應立即建立中央臨時政府；（二）美國不願見德國成爲任何一强國或集團之附庸；亦不願見德人再受獨裁者的統治；（三）英·美·法·蘇四國佔領區，應取消一切隔閡，務使德國在經濟上完全統一；（四）設立德國民族委員會，在聯合國管制之下，處理國事，並起草憲法，以組成德國永久性質之聯邦國；（五）美國反對德國將　爾區割讓與法國及將柯恩尼斯堡區割讓與蘇聯。　　外交攻勢益形加強　　德人聽到貝爾納斯的演說，心中當然覺得有無限的溫暖；英國己完全贊同，並在事實上，英美早己成立協定，合併兩國佔領區之經濟機構；法國對於貝氏的演說，在事前早有所聞，對於統一德國經濟，在原則上，不致異議；但是對於薩爾區問題，法國仍將堅持其原來主張，即要求薩爾區與德國分離，其經濟上隸屬於法國的體系，此在蘇聯，則認爲貝氏的演說，是美國對於德國問題所採取的外交攻勢，並在那裏設法抵消其所發生的後果。莫洛托夫自莫斯科遇返巴黎時，曾取道柏林，對於美國的外交攻勢，似乎在事前早有所聞，且早有準備。所以我們展望下一週內，蘇聯亦將在外交上有所發動，而歐洲分化爲東西兩大集團，也早已成爲定局了。蘇聯火箭襲瑞典　答復原子彈試騐  本報編譯自新聞週刊　　自從今年五月起，瑞典的上空時常有火箭彈成　地飛過。它們飛行的方向是自南向北，幾乎都在在間出現，並且在數量上好像一星期多似一星期。有幾個曾在瑞典境內爆炸，八月十二日　有一個和一架飛機在伐格里特上空互撞。但是這些火箭彈顯然都裝有足量的炸藥，最後會發出耀眼的閃光而自行炸毀，因此落到地面上來的都是一陣焚毀的塵埃。直到八月十四日，瑞典陸軍調査員才宣佈他們尋到了一塊金屬的散片，其上還有文字。　　這些飛過瑞典上空的自動火箭彈，顯然是從德國蘇軍佔領區內發出來的，許多人都以爲這是蘇聯對美國在比基尼島舉行原子彈試騐的一個答覆。在一方面談判和平一方面準備戰爭的現代外交中，這個新發展且有相當重大的意義。閃爍在瑞典上空的火箭彈，對於巴黎和會的工作也很有影響，由此可見世界各國的實驗室正在爭雄競長，努力發展威力更大的新武器。　　據瑞典方面的消息，這些火箭可以後退，躍進，滾動，疾降，上　，因此可以想像得到它們是用無綫電控制的。瑞典人稱呼它們故「幽靈炸庫」或者俄羅斯「V—四型」火箭彈。瑞典向英乞援擬以雷達防御　　瑞典總參謀部認爲：空中這種神秘的侵入「極端嚴重」，據說已經要求英國給予特種雷達裝置，因爲在一九四四年間，英國就用雷達來防禦德國的「V—一型」火箭彈的。　　同時，杜立德爾中將聽說就要到斯托哥爾摩來了。表面上他是代表穀牌油公司來接洽業務的，但是事實上，他或許來研究火箭彈飛行的性能。瑞典人還想用中和火箭彈中炸藥的方法，使它們不致中途爆裂，因此可以獲得完整的火箭彈而硏究其內部的構造。　　第二次世界大戰前，德國曾在比尼蒙特根據地試騐「V—一型」火箭彈，現在的「幽靈炸彈」大致是從該地附近一個叫做格萊斯夫伐爾特奧伊的島上放射出來的。目下德國人一律不准進入這塊地方，事實上已經成爲禁區。技師和工人非紅軍人員就是蘇聯平民。　　大多數的專家都相信瑞典上空所看到的火箭彈是根據「V—一型」火箭彈繼續硏究而來的。戰爭將吿結束時，德國曾致力硏究火箭彈，其飛行圈的爲六百英里，現在在離放射地九百英里的地方，也曾看見過火箭彈飛過，可見其飛行距離已經擴大了。美科學家加緊工作答復蘇聯嚴厲挑　　美國的專家，曾經坦白承認過德國在製造火箭彈方面超過世界其他的國家，而曾經發生過相當的效能。就在今日，各國硏究火箭彈都以德國的原理爲根據。甚至有若干科學家設：假如戰爭慢一點結束，納粹德國可能用火箭彈制勝。　　西方國家和蘇聯都曾經捉到許多德國第一流的科學家。美國人以爲所捉到的德國科學家是最出色的，但是他們大多是研究「V—型」火箭彈的，而今日蘇聯在大　造「V—一型」的火箭彈了。　　但是美國專家以爲蘇聯在火箭彈一類武器的研究方面，還比不上美國，因爲美國在工業，科學和智力方面都佔有優勢。美國科學家所憂慮的，就是道種情形並不是一成不變的，允其在戰爭結束之後，由於硏究人員的注意力大多集中到生產和建設方面去的原故，可能使戰時的研究工作完全陷於停頓。所以民衆方面必須不斷以同情心和基金來鼓勵科學家，藉以應付蘇聯的挑釁。（嘉納）珍聞　　上月中美國人的注意集中在俄亥俄州的科歇克頓城，那裏有一位坐旗杆的技藝家叫做「瘋子馬歇爾」的，今年三十七歲，在五十四公尺高的旗杆頂上一連坐了二十六天以後，忽然想着要結婚了。於是他便降落至地上，向他的未婚妻羅妮小姐（二十一歲，在一家餐館裏當女招待，）建議在旗杆頂上舉行結婚禮。她立刻答應了，擇定六月三十日爲結婚佳期。當天下午，新郞新娘被高舉在旗杆頂上一公尺直徑的高座上面。當牧師在下面站在播音器前面宣讀結婚證書時，這一對高據空中的新郞新娘便在一千七百多觀衆仰首瞻望之際結成了終身伴侶。「瘋子馬歇爾」曾經化費美金三千元建造他的高空座位，這裏有舒適的坐位，有電爐，有電話，還有化學設備的厠所！但是這一對新婚夫婦決定下來在地上度蜜月。每週一人「太陽女神嫡裔」  日本天皇裕仁　譯茲星期六郵報　　被稱爲「太陽女神嫡裔」的日本天皇裕仁，至今仍受着他的臣民和盟軍的拘束。他的身材矮小，態度謙和，額角和下頷略向後低陷，步行時背向前曲，戴着厚重的金邊眼鏡，他對於他的百姓和他的祖先富有責任心。在日本歷代的許多天皇中，裕仁生長在日本歷史上空前的國難時期，不用說是飽經憂患的一位國君了。　　日皇裕仁是深得民心的，看了今春的大選結果就可以證明。今日的日本民衆雖不再把日皇看做一位神明，但是大多數依然効忠於他，一致擁護他而保留了日本的帝制。　　日本投降使日本皇族得到了許多自由，但是裕仁並沒有得到自由。他雖曾作過簡短的廣播演說，但是因爲一他的發音微弱而缺乏熱力，不能引起民衆的注意。倒是他的微服察訪民閱，頗受一般民衆的尊敬和歡迎。允其是一般靑年，在向日皇鞠躬致敬以後，往往抬起頭來對他含笑觀望。這是新日本的現象。在一年以前，這種自然的敬愛的表示會遭受警察的懲罰，但在今日是司空見慣了。裕仁的辦公室在宮內省大厦中，那是一座白色的鋼骨水泥日本式建築物。他和他的皇后和大多數子女同居於築在防空壕上面的小屋中。　　裕仁沒有可以促膝談心的至友，他的兄弟高松和Mikasa比較和他接近些。他是皇宮中諸大臣的奴隸，正如不久以前是陸軍的奴隸一樣。差不多沒有一件事日皂能够自行抉擇的。　　裕仁的私生活極爲嚴肅，飲食異常簡的，不飲酒亦不吸烟，可以說沒有不良的嗜好，有之，一二遊興而已。他的唯一消遣是涉獵羣書，和孩子們玩要，或偶爾在他的生物學實騐室中逗遛。　　裕仁應該擔負　動戰爭的責任是毫無疑義的。不管他的法律上的責任如何，在接受戰爭的一點上說，他的道德上的罪過是無法逃避的。當他准許東條用他的名義宣戰時，這使是他贊成戰爭的明白的表示。以後日本人民之所以能矢中國家努力作戰，大部分是因爲他們相信這是出於日皇的命令。不過日皇裕仁是皂宮中的奴隸和軍國主義者的傀儡，也是事實。因此對於裕仁的控訴不是說他親自發動戰爭，而是說他不敢使用他道義上的勢力來反對它。</p>

<p>春秋文人友情與政治關係  中明　　讀「經緯」週刊近期所載易君左先生的「文壇烏瞰」以後，對於「政治遮住了友情」這一點，不但深具同感，而且覺得君左尚有言之未盡的地方。君左說：「一個文人為著政治，常常會因為政治觀點的參差，把人間最可珍貴的友情沖淡，實在是天地間無可比擬的損失。」於是他惋惜郭沫若先生與郁達夫先生的疏遠！雖然他沒有說明也為郭沫若先生與他自己疏遠的惆悵，但我卻隱隱看出了他有這種同樣的心情。君左以詩人的氣質，分析友情之貴於政治，其故在於「政治的關係不過是一時的，而友情則可以超邁千古。」但，君左只是站在唯心觀點上，評價政治之與友情，殊不知處今唯物觀之世，誰能無野心？誰能安淡泊？因而政治「貴」於友情，是為必然也！　　君左謂友情常因政治觀點之參差而「沖淡」，他說得還嫌太輕鬆，看得也太簡單！據我所知，有若干文友在為這個問題苦惱著，悲哀著！剛剛還接到這樣一位文友的信，（姑隱其名。）他這樣寫著：　　「這一年來，心上總感到無限制的寂寞，眼看人家趨炎附勢，為適應文壇的環境而數變其言論立場，本人態度，於是始得炫耀於文壇。而自己不行，也不甘如此，則甯肯咬住牙根抑壓著自己的熱情，不寫文章；不參加任何文藝集會；一來，因為我已經否定了文藝，甚而否定了人生！二來，因為我受不了有些作家的氣焰。」　　由這封信可以看出因政治關係而摧毀文友的情緒已多麼嚴重？再舉一例子，又是一位文友，（姑隱其名。）昨天曾和我談起一個同性質的問題，他告訴我：　　「最近沒法寫作，也沒法和文友往來了！寫作吧！我只能選些自己曾經體驗；或為自己所熱諗的，關於現實社會生活之素材，甚而是身邊瑣事；我覺得都有意義都有其所反映時代的作用；於是我便都喜歡用我的純真之筆，把它忠實地寫出來！但，有人就會責備我這種作品不夠『前進』！好像文章在今天，如果不喊幾句『民主』，不罵幾句政府，就是不前進！他們絕不會認為你所表現的現實社會生活之種種問題，其側面意義，就是暴露政府的腐化，而加以抨擊，而呼籲民主！他們忘記了我所寫的是文藝，不是口號，標語！同時，他們也忘記了我只是一個文人，並不是一個政治宣傳員。再說，叫我為誰去喊口號；寫標語；當宣傳員呢？平心而論，今天的這種普遍烏煙瘴氣的政治局面，無論是左派；右黨；我都不佩服，因此我都不樂於侍候他們；更不屑於去參加！我只能作一個為文藝而文藝的文人，我的性格和旨趣也只許我作一個絕對自由主義的文人！可是，目前的文藝好像已經瀰漫著一種濃厚的政治空氣；和形成了一種固執的政治勢力；你不能呼吸這個空氣；你就是不前進；你就有被這種勢力打擊和捲沒的危機！為文藝而文藝的作品，被目前違背時代落伍的作品，自由主義的文人，被日信不革命的灰色文人！這種情形之下，我感受著精神上莫大的威脅，文章我不敢再寫了，因為我既無能附會『前進』，又經不起無情的打擊和捲沒。我不能比沈從文，沈從文究竟牌子老了，挨兩下也不在乎。我之不敢再和文友們往來，是因為今天的文友與文友之情誼是建築在志同道合的政治關係上的。響喻有些文友對文友的取捨標準，也和文藝一樣；誰『前進』，誰可以接近；誰不前進，誰便被拒之於千里之外。也還有些少數文友，雖然以我之『不前進』為尚稱『安分』，但又以我之並不反對前進而勿滿，而加以左『傾』的嫌疑罪名。總之，置身今日文壇，左責右詰，已使得我頭目眩暈，莫衷一是了！所以我的唯一逃避方法，就是從此擲筆務農，杜門謝客！」　　事實上，以上兩位文友確是很少寫作，和露書面了！他們都是致力文藝多年的自由主義作家，他們都很熱情，可觀，他們跟我一樣，僅知尊人道，尙正義，忠於良心；忠於文藝，視政治為畏途之誠實的文藝寫作者。他們沒法應付和容忍。這個文藝政治化的環境，於是他們被歧視；被嘲笑；有時候更遭受難堪的冷落與輕蔑。（歧視，這些歧視他們；嘲笑他們，冷落他們，輕蔑他們的文友，和他們還有著歷史的友誼。）不但如此，據他們告訴我，這些有著歷史友誼的文友，除了自己疏遠他們以外，並且向和他們不大熟的文友，或則是根本不相識的文友，以及讀者，批評他們「思想有問題」，「立場灰色」；甚而什麽有「某某背景」，等等無中生有的假象，企圖用這種種絕沒有根據的流言，或亂視聽，陷這羣無辜的純真文友於孤立之境！所以，就難怪她們彷徨，怨懣，而終於悲觀地「擲筆」，「杜門」了。　　總之，今日之文壇是希望每個文人都作聞一多第二，也許有人在那兒開始效仿聞一多，自命聞一多了！我們對聞一多的評價，是不是以他「走出書房」的一變而為「鼓手」的貢獻，其偉大不朽，甚於他既往在學術上研究成就的貢獻？這是另外一個問題，我相信將來自有明眼人加以論定。然而聞一多之所以改變作風，究竟是因為已經參與了政治活動，所以他有為民盟而呐喊而犧牲的義務。然大家既非均有政治背景，又何必都要硬學聞一多。其實聞一多的犧牲，雖光榮，也太冤枉！他是文人，他在文藝上又絕對成功的把握，在政治上就不見得！因為政治的本身是冷酷的，陰謀的，而文人的熱情，坦白。搞政治既不能成功，且終不免為「利害」衝突所殺！假如他能專門致力文藝，文藝一旦成功，或比政治的成功更有裨益於國家，社會，人類！因此，我站在文藝的立場，為聞一多的死，感到萬分痛楚的惋惜！試想，這樣，又有何裨益於國家，社會，人類呢？文人是國家，社會，人類之靈魂的導師，文人盡可以盡其本能的天職，從旁策動國家，社會，人類的進度，謀其福利的發達，爲什麽偏偏非要把這些善良的純真的智慧之舉，一個個硬送上政治斷頭臺不可呢？摘政治必須有槍刀為後盾，一個單憑一張嘴，一枝筆的文人，能搞動刀槍嗎？這是歷史上絕沒有的事情！已經參與了政治活動的文友不去管他了，但願他們能夠成功。而還沒有參與政治活動的文友，似乎大可不必了，硬要使他時打腫臉充胖子，明明沒有什麽中心信仰，硬要他們矯揉地嘴裏面喊著口號，筆下寫著標語！是為壯聲勢嗎？天知道，文人有什麽「聲勢」啊！有槍刀的權威者，不會怕你們的，即如文人全是聞一多，如果權威者不能容忍文人，那麼不消十排子彈也就可以全部一并掃光！這樣的結果，又有什麽意義呢？所以奉勸今日的文壇，此後還是超然一點的好！尊重文藝自有其春秋，尊重無論有無政治背景的文友，亦各有其獨立的思想及人格！不要作得文藝必須政治窄狹化；文人凡為自有主義者必摒棄於門外；要知道文壇也應「民主」啊！　　最後，要談到文友與文友之間的所應有的尊重，不管你是左派或右黨，政治之外，你不能沒有你的私生活，私生活乃是精神與物資的交響曲，精神的享受，便是人間至珍極貴的友情！友情是愛之結晶，政治乃鑄恨之大成。（有恨才有鬥爭，政治即鬥爭的表現。）人生無愛，活著還有什麽趣味呢？所以，文友需要胸襟開闊，（文友者，文藝之交的朋友。）不要因為被此政治立場或間接之不同而相仇視，不要希望你的文友都是你的通知，要能容納各黨各派的文友。重複一句君左的話：「友情是不朽的，政治關係是一時的。」純真的友情，可以共患難，政治的友情，只能共安樂！因此別以為你杜絕了純真的友情之後，你可以永恆得到同志的愛護。其實大為不然，政治關係完了，同志的愛護也會完的，因為政治的友情，是維繫於利害的，那時，你會遭受到和被你拒之千里之外的文友之同樣命運！孤獨，寂寞，冷清，悲哀！阿倫坡小傳  殷懷遠譯　　阿倫坡是美國文學界的巨人之一（一八〇九－一八四九）。他的醫生是短促無歡的，幸而他的詩歌和小說很早就成了名的，並且在歐美同時得到了賞識。他的作品在歐美文壇上佔著很高的地位。現在他們像一個活著的詩人，並被譽為美國現代分析的偵探小說的創作者。　　和阿倫坡同時代的法國詩人，高地亞和波戴萊，其中一個還是第一流的小說家，他們都尊稱他為美國的天才作家。他們極力推崇阿倫坡的作品，使在法國流行。不久之後，阿倫坡的名字也就在歐洲大陸上不脛而走了。他逝世後四十年，他的作品仍不斷的被譯成十種不同的文字，包括瑞典，意大利，丹麥和西班牙等西國文字。　　在美國，阿倫坡使短篇小說。行至今未衰。他最著名的散文小說有「可憐的陳屍所謀殺案」，「金蟲」，「劇院的傾倒」，「被竊的書信」和「瑪麗勞吉的秘密」；他的詩「大鴉」給人的印象最深也最有活氣的。其他得到好評的有「蕾諾亞」，「鐘」和最後寫的「阿那貝爾·李」。　　阿倫坡在文學批評界也有相當的地位。他的批評是鋒利的，有時候他對於平凡的魯鈍作是毫不留情的抨擊。但是由於他個人單獨的好評，也曾使紐約承認了霍桑是一個卓越的小說家。　　阿倫坡是很重視寫作的技術，而對於旁的都不太注意。他雖然很早就有優良的生活環境，但他的一生卻的確生活在顛簸流離中。他在一八〇九年一月十九日生於馬嶐諸塞士州的波士頓。他的父母是流動賣藝的伶人，兩個人在阿倫坡三歲前都死去了。約翰阿倫一個富裕的菸草商人，把他帶了回家撫育，並使他接受最優良的教育－起初在英格爾，後來在維金尼亞州的里士滿城。在還不到十五歲的年紀，阿倫坡九開始作詩了。於是在一八二六年他被送入維金尼亞大學念書。在學校裡他的功課出人頭地，拉丁文和法文都獲得了榮譽獎，但是他的放蕩的天性卻於此時開始表現了。在年終的時候，他竟負了到二千五百元的賭債。約翰阿倫替他清償了賭債，但要他退學回筆資自己的辦公室工作。　　他對於商業完全不感興趣，卻偏偏在這個時候，他的未婚妻解除了對他的婚約。在這雙重的打擊之下，他唯有跑到波士頓去，以擺脫一切羈絆和苦悶。他最先寫的詩「坦麥塄」是在那裏發表的，這是未成熟的作品。僅使他沾得了一點小名氣。不久，仍在寬恕他的約翰阿倫，突然接到了他的信說他已經投筆從軍了。他這一去就當了兩年的兵。於是最後一次，他的家庭利用它的勢力，使他入讀西點軍校。阿倫坡在學習中的成績很高，但是到了一八三一年，他因故意屢次曠課而被學習開出了。　　事實上，他已決定了不顧成敗而從事寫作了。他在巴爾的摩爾城潦倒了幾年，雖有著述卻求售無門，致沒有一篇發表。到了一八三五年，他帶著一小包的原稿和自信的種氣，再次出現於里士滿城。不久他就覓到，「南方文學前區報」助理編轉的職位，因此得在報上發表他的一些小說和詩歌。很快的他的文名又紅了起來。他在故鄉成了一個極有名望的人。一年後他和一個妙齡女郎克雷麗小姐結婚，婚後伉儷極帶唱隨之藥。但他始終不能把喝酒的習慣戒除。野逸不羈的性情，卒使他在一八三七年失掉了原來的職位。於是夫婦兩祗好離開里士滿城。　　經過了這一次的打擊後，阿倫坡的一生所謀多不過意――明明已達到山巔快要成功了，偶又驟然的跌了下來一敗塗地。這些年來他從未獲得足夠的錢，可以享享安逸的生活。他時時作暴飲，他的太太又是一個體弱多病的人。阿倫坡於一八四四年遷居紐約後，他的名望增高了，然而窮根卻依然未斷。在一段很短的時期內，他似乎快要成功了。他自己發行了一種報紙「百老匯日報」，但不久他就遭到了經濟的困難。「大鴉」印行後，使他轉眼就稱為了美國最著名的文學家。這段時期，又是最適合他以作書家評為主要事業的時候。――他的太太歿於一八四七年。　　至此他好像又交起了好運來了。他的「阿那貝爾·李」在一八四八年初發表後，立刻博得普遍的好評。他在該年夏天，回到里士滿城，發奮戒酒，并準備重新結婚。他的未婚妻允許給他一個家庭和舒適的生活。他的有了轉機的前途充滿了希望，但他破了戒，又狂飲了起來，因此在一八四九年十月七日死去。　　憂患和飽經憂患的人逝去了，但是他的作品的價值與日俱增，在世界文學之林是不朽的。　　（譯自U.S.A　Vol.1　No.7.作者為該誌編者）風景  佚名音樂家的生涯  嘉惠　　黎奧浦·奧爾（Leopold　Auer）是一位偉大的小提琴教授，在我們這一代裏，他較其他各位教授發掘與訓練了更多的音樂天才。他告訴我們，你如想成為一個大音樂家，你應該生養在窮苦中。他說，有一種要棄――他承認他自己不能確切知道這要素是什麽，――但他認定總有此種要素存埋在窮困時的靈魂之中。這要素很神秘，這要素很美麗，這要素能促進感覺，力量，同情和親切。一寸山河一寸血  業勁風29　　可是等您坐下，也許抽根煙哪什麽的，抓起您的「生命線」――那一枝筆，想一揮而就的話，那至少我頭一個就要替你流汗。換句話說，祗要你不是一位混蛋，那我祗得請教您究竟可以寫點什麽。　　先描寫他的寓所？不成！您得替人家想想，他的住處是不是應該保守一點神秘。頭一點，您是因著什麽關係，採取什麽步驟，才能見到他的？一定有兩個曲折，反正不太直接，不是嗎？那麼，你下筆就拿「××」代表城市，再用「××」代表路或街角。關於家裡的佈置，方向，大小，地位，四外的風景或鄰近的情況，您以為可以放開手寫了。　　再說，關於他的言談舉止，關於他的個性，關於他的一切，祗要是您能觀察到的；您也以為可以還用著那先生之筆，繼量的寫了。當然，你要是不會寫，當然沒有人會請教您了，也沒有這麼落伍的刊物替您登載。您必是能寫的，而且寫得逼真，寫得那麼生動，生動得「此中有人，呼之欲出。」此外，您要是守著作家或記者的道德的話，您決不能給人家添顏著色，把人家形容成了一個超人或是神仙。總之必得寫得恰好，恰合分寸。　　好。讓我們拜讀一下您這篇大作「××先生訪問記」的前一半吧：一開頭連標題在內，我們就要碰到許多「×」活迸迸地在人眼簾上跳進跳出。這就有幾分討厭，不是嗎？您可滿不在乎；因為好文章還在後頭呢。果然，您就寫越得意。把焦訪問的對象，描畫得逼真，簡直讓我們讀了，好像自己也去訪過了一次，也曾親自見過這位「××先生」或「××女士」一樣。　　那麼，我得請問了。第一問，這些忠勇的秘密工作者，他們不能像幽靈或鬼怪一般，永遠躲在暗諏裏活動，至少，在普通社會裏面，或在那些工作的「對象」有關係的社會中，他一定有一種或兩種場面上的公開活動，他作為行動的掩護。萬一那個「對象」也是一個能手，唯一對方也很留意搜集像您的大作這一類的材料，（要是真有這一類寫作的話，必不能逃過對方的眼目。我本人就知道日寇特工，對於我方工作人員之類的材料，搜求不厭求詳。）請問，您這麼一寫，是否等於活活地把他辛辛苦苦佈置起來的掩護，全盤揭穿。　　還得問一句：您懂得他所說「不在繼續工作」的意義？您可覺得出這幾個字的分量？這幾個字，換句話來說，那就是凡是關於他的一切，您都不能發表一個字。您或者要說既是如此，這位某先生當初就不應當接見您哪。那也許當初您沒有說明訪的宗旨，也許因為介紹人的面情難卻；也許他願意見舉一見，就是要告訴您這一句話。</p>

<p>自由談馬禁以外  少夫　　關於開放馬禁問題，各界人士，都十分關切；從讀者踴躍的向本刊投票中，可以看出各界對於戰後上海市政的蛻變，都非常熱心。從這件事看上海，我們覺得上海依然充盈着朝氣。　　我們既然向讀者廣徵意見，那麽對於馬禁開放與否及其功過是非，在這一測騐獲得結果之前，自無須即作主觀的論斷。這里，僅僅就事論事貢獻一些意見。　　我們以為：不管馬禁開放與否，跑馬廳這一廣大場地，空着不用總不是辦法。所以有人說：「什麽都贊成，只是反對閒着不用。」因此，我們希望：無論如何這一次參議會不但對於馬禁問題應當有肯定的辦法，而且對於跑馬廳這一塊大好空地的主權問題，也該提出討論並決定。據說在清末，這塊地，曾由清政府作駐兵之用，後來怎樣淪於外人之手，我們似應仔細一點察明究竟！如果賽馬不能「放行」，我們是不是可以收回這塊土地？不然的話，運動場一類的計劃，進行起來，似也很麻煩。　　我們沒有別的意見，僅僅希望兩點：（一）對於這件事情，希望政府尊重民意，不要失人心！（二）無論怎麽樣，議了就要決，決了就要行！在目前的上海情形下，一塊大空地，閒着長青草，是可惜的！對於賽馬的意見　　開宗明義第一章；我反對開放馬禁：　　上海不是鬧馬荒嗎：我們為何不利用這麽大的廣場，造許多房子，租給市民們住，不但得到收入，而且市民會感激涕淋！　　上海不是缺乏體育館嗎？缺少運動場嗎？為什麽體育館和運動場都不及賽馬場來得需要？　　多數的市民都堅持着一個總要求：跑馬廳改什麽都可以，只有開放「馬禁」把它做賭博場所是大錯特錯！  佑　　馬禁果真會取銷麽？有人驚異地問，其實只不過利和弊的問題，假使利多弊少、那我也會舉手。我們不妨先自賽馬場的地點說起，為什麽跑馬場要建立在都市的商業中心區？正如現在跑馬廳負責人所建議的「利」的問題一樣，為了本身的更多利益。現在我們是復興，建設，同時需要充實國力的時期，絕不可為了五億元之數，而被誘惑；這些錢會有血腥氣的。從前參加跑馬賭賽者不少職員階級，影響所及，發生舞弊，捲逃，盜劫，甚至自殺者有之。退一步說，這，至少有一部份是由於馬賽造成的結果。　　我們萬萬不能因為事關市府收入，因而增加了社會內在的不安。　　現在，市中心區的跑馬廳已改為中正公園了。並且內設圖書館，博物館，體育場一切踏上新時代，你們造成嗎，這是抗戰後都市的蛻變，市政的新生。我希望南京路的跑馬廳也如法泡製！  大中　　據報載：跑馬廳恢復賽馬之說，雖尚持市參議會通過，然似已得當局之「默契」，原因是為了增　五億四千萬元的財政收入。　　市　財政不從正當的稽徵方式着手，而矚目於製造罪惡的賭博上，那麽乾脆敵僞時代的賭台烟窟都可以縱容它們恢復起來；還有跑狗的逸園，何不利用一番，「雙管齊下」，以收更大的效果呢？　　誰都知道參議會是市民的喉舌，參議員是市民的代表，市民對議員們寄予極大的厚望，盼參議員們能不負市民的厚望，這次恢復賽馬事件，是一個最好的測騐，也是議員能否以民意為前提的「試金石」！　　賽馬是賭，賭是萬惡的淵薮，為自身利害着想，我們自不能等閒視之！  卞顯佳作何解釋？  金陵　　友邦將剩餘物資售給中國，中共認為助長內戰，不知將東九省工業設備，搬而去之者，作何解釋？幽默小品都是老手  錢錫麒　　一個匈牙利騎兵隊的軍官，需要一筆錢去償還他的賭債。他決定賣掉一只戒指。　　他把那戒指裝在一只紅皮小箱子內，然後郵寄給他家鄉一個專門放債叫做史丘士的商人。他知道史丘士是一個刻薄而工於心計的老傢伙，所以另外附了一封信說道：「要是你願意出三千元錢，就把那戒指留下，否則，即刻退還給我，我不願賤價賣掉。」　　可是老家夥的回音來了，這戒指不值三千元，最多只能給二千元錢。這個軍官一見大怒，立刻給他一個電報，定價三千元，沒有還價的。隔一天，來了一個回電，加到二千五百元，他說絕對不能再多了。　　這時候，這個軍官已不能忍耐他的憤怒，告訴那老傢伙道：「戒指值三千元，你不要，立刻把他退回來」。　　不多幾天後，郵局裏送來了一個包裹，裏面是一只紅波小箱子，很週到的貼上了封條，另外也附了一封信說道：「經過專家們的估計，那戒指不值三千元，你不能堅持要這樣大的價錢，現在我出你二千八百元，這是你最後的機會了，要是這價錢你願意賣，你不必開那箱子，就這樣原封不動的寄來好了，要是不願意，那你收起你的戒指，我也不要買了。」　　這軍官盛怒之下，立誓不願把那戒指少賣一分錢，他預備另找主顧了。　　撕掉了封條，把那紅皮小箱子打開一看，奇怪的是那戒指已不在裏面，却是一張小紙條兒，上面寫道：「請你不必動怒，我照付三千元就是了」。國際划艇比賽：是項比賽於上月底在美國沙他華湖舉行，為期三日，圖示獲得冠軍之一對選手。科學家賞月  希賢　　大小：直徑二一六三哩；圓周六七九五哩；面積一四七〇三〇〇〇平方哩；體積五二九九一〇〇〇〇〇立方哩。　　距離：距地球最遠時二五二七一〇哩；最近二二一四六三哩；平均距離二三八八五七哩；月光到達地球需時一·五秒。　　旋轉：每小時旋行二二八七哩；繞軌道周轉一次，計廿七日七小時四三分一一·四七秒；繞地球旋轉自第一次新月至第二次新月共需時廿九日十二小時四四分二·八秒。　　質量：月球體積為地球體積之〇·〇二〇三〇約五十分之一〇；其密度為地球密度之〇·六〇五；月球上　體物質之重量為水重之三·三四倍；而地球上質重為水重之五·五二倍；月球重量為地球重量之〇·〇一二三（約八十分之一）。　　光綫：所有月球之光綫皆自太陽反射而來，平均月球僅反射所吸收光綫之〇·〇七三（約十四分之一　）。（節譯自Parade）商人文化  無憂　　下面這類怪市招，非僅偏僻的街頭巷尾觸目皆是，即鬧市的大馬路上也累見不鮮：奇文共賞，不敢自私，敬錄如下：　　「自由美國專車運到的新鮮水菓。」　　「霉透霉透衛生　乳。」　　「本號自釀道地山西汾酒。」　　「人造真絲舞襪。」　　「真正天津的良鄉栗子。」　　「五香臭蛋，氣味芬芳。」　　「民主作風的新式公文皮包。」　　「本醫師發明原子方法精治梅毒。」　　「特聘港粤名廚師，專調四川真口味。」　　「本園溫度經常在沸點以下，是滬上唯一無二消暑聖地。」　　「響應政府節約建國運動號召，請來嚐試本館豪華美點。」　　——諸如此類，記不勝記；這也是今日上海市場上文化的一部份。你如有此雅興，不妨在馬路上多留心，管保你日日都會有意想不到的新發現。改裝  義喬　　前些日子報載：「有某進口行將大量美國奶粉，创去商標，改換裝璜；事為警局探悉，當即派員前去拘獲，送局究辦云」。於是在第二次報上，就有該行來函更正，聲明該奶粉之商標创去，事先已得美國之出品公司允許。並附有電報一紙證明。於是一場風波，就此平息。　　事實上，像這類的事情，多得不勝枚舉。在戰前，就有人將日貨改為國貨。在外國貨吃香的時候，就有將國貨冒充洋貨；也會印上一行Made　in　U.S.A的小字。現在洋貨雖然仍舊還很吃香，但是因為貨多，冒牌多，價錢往往反而買不起。所以就有人將洋貨改裝了，或許會變成國貨，乘着目下提倡國貨的機會，也好來出一下風頭，撈進些鈔票。　　本來偷天換日的本領是商人的拿手戲，掛羊頭買狗肉，無非想賺些鈔票，可是抹煞良心，不管道德的事情，終非所宜。何況自己也是中國人，何必一定要死命地來推銷洋貨呢？  路局來函　編者先生：　　頃閱本年八月廿一日貴報自由談欄內痴墨君所投「北站所見」一稿，所述各點早經本路切實籌劃改善，茲特分述於后：　　（一）查勝利以還，各地人口劇變，物資供應不能平衡，故携帶商貨之旅客甚眾。本路除力謀疏通貨運外，特在不妨礙正當旅客條件之下，規定携帶貨物之旅客限乘坐普通客列車及區間車，至所帶貨物亦經規定，最大以二十公斤為限，以免妨礙其他旅客。　　（二）發售客票時間規定於車開前三小時起始，但兩列車開行時刻相距有不滿三小時者，例如上午九時上北站開行之四次車客票，須俟上午七時開行之二次車啟行後，方可開始發售，且客票又須順號發售，不得提前越號，以杜流弊，故事實不能於三小時前發售，實屬無可如何。本路現正積極籌劃，恢復戰前各大站全日售票辦法，每一票窗可購得任何一站客票，隨到隨購，無須擠軋。　　（三）上海北站又復發現黑市票及孩童扒竊二點，承痴墨君指示，無任感　，已密派幹員會同本路警務處嚴予取締。　　京滬區鐵路管理局運務處低調  三公　　蘇州鬧狐，張天師一笑置之。　　最近蘇州靜心庵發生「狡猾新聞」，　　　　　經請張天師協助破案，當時張天師一笑置之，未置　否。大約張天師亦認為這是「迷信」之談吧！　　清查團離滬赴杭，臨行還收到兩份却之不「公」的　儀——最後遞到的密告信。　　如果把經濟部長王靈五所說：我甯願「小題大做」，不願意「大題小做」兩句話不加說明，簡直使人誤會到他老人家是個「好事之徒」。　　溥儀從日本解　海參崴，臨行接見記者，把日皇裕仁臭罵一頓，居然像煞有介事，可憐亦復可笑！連環漫畫　三毛從軍記　（九八）  張樂平作國外瑣聞美國庸醫之王  郁強　　江湖醫師橫行無忌　　庸醫，使企望康復的人走向死亡，比疾病的本身更可怕。　　這裏介紹一位在美國被稱為「庸醫之王」的席拉森的事蹟。從此中我們可以更瞭解一些庸醫的勾當。　　席拉森做為一名形跡可疑的醫生已有四十一年了。他曾被判刑三次，另有兩次因販賣麻醉藥被捕，但是他還是繼續其未經認可的行醫。你不要以為缺少慣例的資格會削減他的收入，據估計他每年的收入約有五十萬元美金。他在紐約州島的卡城掛了六個禮拜「專家」的牌子，就收入診費三萬六千元。　　坐過監獄　在他的五百個月行醫期間中，祗有三十個月是消磨在監獄裏的。席拉森對於醫術的基本訓練，僅是在一所醫科夜校中攻讀了一年。但是他後來却　稱在瑪　　醫學院畢業，並且讀了一年後得到一張文憑。他拿了這張文憑向許多州政府申請領取開業執照，　獲核准。但是　　甘州却不　　信任，實行調查，結果發覺：他　造　他的學院的文　的　　　　　　。　　雖然如此，席拉森借重於法律專家和能幹的律師，還能在幾個州內保持執照，開診行醫。　　冒名頂替　在他不能獲得執照的地方，他常頂用退休的醫生的名字和執照，給他們每週二十五元的津貼，外加佣金。　　近年來，席拉森變成了「整容專家」，還說曾在柏林，維也納及其他大陸中心學習過。天曉得，他是從來未曾跨出國門的呀！　　他大量收集許多出名的婦女的「診　」與「診後」的照片，但是她們都說不認識席拉森，未曾請他行過整容和其他返老還童的治療。　　自從他開業四十一年以來，各種逮捕都未能使他結束「行醫」。由於多方面的刺激，本　凡尼亞州政府的醫務局開始對他的行為加以調查。隨着，奇怪的事情就發生了。證人們都接到恐嚇的電話。局裏的調查員——後來被解職——　改證人的證詞，變成了滔滔的為席拉森辯護的袒詞。他告訴以前的病人說，他們所說的一切將用作反告他們。周裏的主任也為了同類的不規反被解職了。　　錢可通神　一件事情是確切的：無論何種抗制他的行動，席拉森都能夠通過法庭與之與旋，因為他有金錢，律師和膽量。</p>

<h3>Recovery of Gubeikou, Communist Troops in Retreat, National Army Approaches Zhangjiakou on Three Routes, Intensified Siege of Jining and Fengzhen in Eastern Sui</h3>

<h3>Zhang Qun Flies to America for Medical Treatment, Leaves Shanghai Yesterday on a Military Special Plane</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Chairman Zhang Qun of Sichuan flew to America yesterday morning for medical treatment. Zhang's family told reporters that Zhang had a small tumor below his right ear, and later learned that it was cancer, so he went abroad for treatment. According to Zhang's family, Zhang had surgery for this disease, and the pain was not very severe. Although Zhang has taken a three-month leave for his trip abroad, it still depends on the treatment situation.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, This City] Zhang Qun, Chairman of the Sichuan Provincial Government, accompanied by his wife, Ms. Ma Yuying, and Dr. Dong Bingqi, flew from Jiangwan Airport at 7:00 am yesterday morning on a US military special plane, taking the route through Tokyo, Hawaii, and other places to America for medical treatment.

A reporter visited Zhang Jizheng, Zhang's eldest son, yesterday to inquire about his father's illness. He said that the tumor on his neck was initially thought to be nothing serious, but after being hospitalized for surgery in Chengdu on the 5th of this month, the doctor diagnosed it as a malignant tumor, which may affect the thyroid gland. It cannot be cured without deep X-ray examination. There is no such equipment in the country, so he had to go to the United States for treatment. According to those close to Zhang, although he felt pain after the tumor in his head was removed, his spirits were still good and his diet was normal. After arriving in Shanghai on the evening of the 9th, he had a very pleasant meeting at his private residence on Avenue Albert with important guests who came to visit, including President Song Ziwen, Secretary-General Wu Tiecheng, Wu Dingchang, and Zhang Junmai, Qian Xinzhi, and Du Yuesheng.</p>

<h3>American Journalists Discuss the Chinese Communist Party, Which Has Always Been a Constituent of the Third International and Has Close Ties with Moscow</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 10th] The Washington News published an article by columnist Lamar on August 28 entitled "Is the Chinese Communist Party Really Communist?" The main points are as follows:</p>
<p>Some people think that the Chinese Communist Party is not a communist party, but a combination of liberals, democrats, and land reformers. However, judging from the letters from readers in the newspaper, it is generally believed that Moscow has recognized the communists in Yan'an as qualified communists. This can be proved by Moscow broadcasts and Soviet newspapers, which never recognize those who are wandering and indecisive as communists.</p>
<p>Until the Third International pretended to dissolve during the war, the Chinese Communists had always been a powerful constituent of the organization. Mao Zedong also served as the organization's executive committee member. In November and December of last year, the pamphlets distributed by the New York State Communist Party headquarters even listed Mao's "On New Democracy" and "Struggle for a New China" as required reading for communists, along with the works of Lenin and Stalin. Recently, Li Lisan was appointed as Lin Biao's political adviser, which is enough to show the close connection between Moscow and the Chinese Communist Party. Li came to the Northeast with the Soviet occupation army, and the Chinese Communist Party obtained the Japanese prisoners' ammunition and weapons at that time, which are now being used to carry out their war against the government. The Central Political Bureau of the Chinese Communist Party issued a notice, of which we have recently obtained a translation, stating that the Bureau agrees with the opinions of the Far East Bureau of the Third International, which indicates that the Third International is becoming active again.</p>

<p>[United Press, Washington, 9th] US Senator Brewster announced today that steel rails originally scheduled to be shipped to China were shipped to Yugoslavia and demanded that the State Department investigate the truth.

A State Department spokesman also said that the steel rails destined for China would not be restricted or delayed, and that almost all of the designated steel rails would be prepared for shipment once the embargo was lifted or eased.</p>

His career was remarkable, and his contributions were outstanding. Later, he retired after success, showing indifference to fame and wealth. His noble character is worthy of emulation. It is deeply mourned that he has passed away and should be praised by decree, and his life and deeds should be preserved and announced in the national history to highlight his old achievements. This decree.</p>

<h3>Tianjin to Establish Stock Exchange</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 10th] After the opening of the Shanghai Stock Exchange, it is rumored that a stock exchange will also be established in the capital. According to Director Deng of the Commercial Department of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, Nanjing is not a commercial city and has very few factories. Although someone applied to establish one before, it is feared that it will be difficult to approve. However, Tianjin is an important commercial port in North China, and a stock exchange may be established there soon.</p>
<h3>Japanese Nationals and Ryukyuans in Taiwan Province to be Repatriated This Month; 660,000 Japanese Nationals in Northeast Arrive in Japan</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Taipei, 10th] The Japanese Nationals Management Committee of Taiwan Province has ordered approximately 1,800 Japanese nationals who evaded repatriation and were not approved for requisition in April to report to the county governments before the 15th to participate in the organization and await repatriation. The Committee also stipulates that those who fail to report by the deadline will be arrested by local police. According to the Committee, there are a total of 24,000 Japanese technicians and their families who are retained. Among them, 1,000 technicians and their families, totaling 5,000, will continue to be retained. The remaining 19,000 have also been decided to be repatriated in four batches, with 5,000 people transported in each batch. For several months, the issue of repatriating Japanese nationals has been discussed with the US to dispatch ships, but there have been no results. It has now been decided to use the "Tainan" ocean liner, which was repaired and docked last month, for transportation. The ship is currently sailing to Hainan Island to pick up Taiwan compatriots and will begin transporting Japanese nationals after returning to Taiwan at the end of this month.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] The 10,132 Ryukyu residents currently staying in Taiwan will be repatriated to the Great Ryukyu Island in their entirety. In April of this year, 4,000 people were transported back to their hometowns by US warships, but the US military authorities refused to allow them to land due to a food shortage on the Great Ryukyu Island, so the repatriation was stopped. The second repatriation will still be transported by US warships and is expected to begin this month, transporting 2,000 people per month. Among these 10,000 Ryukyuans, some are still residing in the Sales Center camp, and the supplies are provided by us. The remaining part mostly serve as servants here and maintain their livelihoods themselves.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 10th] The Northeast Japanese Nationals and Prisoner Management Office announced that it received a telegram from the US side of the Allied Headquarters in Tokyo on the 9th stating that as of now, a total of 663,202 Japanese nationals deported from the Northeast have returned to Japan.</p>
<h3>Marriage Issues Involved Amidst the Repatriation of Japanese Nationals; Executive Yuan Promulgates New Regulations</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Taipei, 10th] Regarding the issue of whether Chinese-Japanese interracial couples can reside within our country's borders, the Executive Yuan has sent a telegram to this place stipulating: (1) Chinese women who marry Japanese men and lose Chinese nationality are allowed to choose to go to Japan with their husbands or stay in China themselves. (2) Chinese men and Japanese women, regardless of whether they married before or after the war, are allowed to choose to stay or leave. The same applies to Chinese men who are sons-in-law to Japanese women. The Taiwan Provincial Government previously stipulated that Japanese women who married Chinese men after August 15th of last year would still be subject to repatriation. This regulation has been cancelled. According to the new regulations of the Executive Yuan, all Japanese men must be repatriated to Japan, while some Japanese women may still remain within the borders of China.</p>

<h3>Fushun Coal Production at 3,000 Tons Per Day; Miners Rely on Relief from UNRRA</h3>
<p>[United Press, Tianjin, 10th] Reports state that most of the largest Fushun Coal Mine in the Far East is currently shut down, and more than 30,000 miners are unable to make ends meet. Currently, the Fushun Coal Mine only produces 3,000 tons of coal per day, while it produced 25,000 tons during the Japanese occupation. Although miners are unemployed and "chewing grass" to survive, the takeover officials are spending huge sums of money on banquets. UNRRA has set up three relief stations to provide relief to Fushun miners and their families.</p>
<h3>Chairman of Sichuan Provincial Party Headquarters Resigns; Approved</h3>
<p>Rumors of Zeng Kuangqing as Successor</p>
<p>[Our Chongqing Correspondent, 10th] Huang Jilu, Chairman of the Sichuan Provincial Party Headquarters, submitted his resignation to the Central Government. It is reported that it has been approved. Among the candidates for successor, Zeng Kuangqing has the highest voice.</p>
<h3>Mid-Autumn Festival in Wuhan; Tight Credit, Many Robberies</h3>
<p>[Our Hankou Correspondent, 10th] Today is the Mid-Autumn Festival. The credit situation in Wuhan is extremely tight, and robberies have occurred frequently. The Municipal Police Bureau has strengthened its precautions to prevent bandits and thieves.</p>
<h3>Improve Facilities on Guangdong-Hankou Railway</h3>
<p>Hou Jiayuan Suggests Loans from the United States</p>
<p>[Our Hankou Correspondent, 10th] According to Hou Jiayuan, head of the Executive Yuan Engineering Planning Group, who returned to Hankou from Hunan, the prospects for improving the Guangdong-Hankou Railway facilities are very optimistic. Only by strengthening the roadbed, replacing it with heavy steel rails, and rebuilding bridges can 50-ton trains be run, making it a model railway in our country. It is estimated that the total cost of improving the entire line will only be over 10 billion yuan. Therefore, it is proposed to suggest that the government borrow from the United States in order to cooperate with the bureau's renovation plan and actively implement the improvement work.</p>
<h3>Postal Rates Will Not Increase Before November This Year</h3>
<p>Xu Jizhuang Firm in His Resignation</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 10th] People in the postal sector say that the post office has suffered huge losses, losing 10 billion yuan last month alone. However, postal rates are unlikely to increase before November. When they do increase in the future, the rate for regular letters may increase to 400 yuan, because according to cost accounting, this is not enough to make up for the losses. And it is not a long-term solution to rely on government subsidies. Regarding the transfer of the director, Xu Jizhuang is very firm in his resignation. The difficulty is that there is no suitable successor at the moment. It is rumored that the post and telecommunications will be merged. There may be some difficulties in implementing this. Amid the calls for layoffs from all sides, there is also talk of tightening postal services. However, the general treatment of postal workers is lower than that of ordinary civil servants, and their work is very burdensome (it is said that the current workload in the Jiangsu region has increased by 400% compared to the beginning of the rehabilitation), while the increase in personnel is only 12%, which is really not enough. Therefore, it is hoped that the authorities will carefully consider this.</p>
<h3>Verdict Announced in the Chang Donge Case; Two Perpetrators Sentenced to Imprisonment</h3>
<p>[Our Suzhou Correspondent, 10th] Huang Zhaochuan and Yu Jishan, former section chiefs of the Suzhou Direct Branch of the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui Enemy and Puppet Property Management Bureau, were guilty of dereliction of duty and corruption, leading to the suicide of the young woman Chang Donge. The case was exposed by local public opinion, and public outrage was aroused. Han, the chief prosecutor of the Jiangsu High Prosecutor's Office, learned of the incident and instructed Kan, the chief prosecutor of the Wudi Prosecutor's Office, to direct prosecutor Xiao Qi to investigate. A public prosecution was immediately filed. After several trials by female judge Wang Xiuqing of the Criminal Court, the case has been concluded. The verdict was announced at 4:00 PM on the 10th. More than 100 people were in court to listen, including the Women's Association, the Chang An Aftermath Support Association, reporters from various newspapers, and the public. Judge Wang rose to the bench and ordered Huang and Yu to be brought forward. Their faces were pale, their expressions fearful, and they stood respectfully before the public case, listening quietly to the verdict. Judge Wang stood up and read the main text: Huang Zhaochuan took advantage of his position to defraud property and was sentenced to three years and six months of imprisonment and deprived of public rights for three years. Yu Jishan helped to take advantage of his position to defraud property and was sentenced to one year and nine months of imprisonment and deprived of public rights for two years. After the verdict was announced, the two perpetrators stated that they were not satisfied and would prepare to appeal.</p>

<h3>Local News Briefs</h3>
<p>Taixing Correspondent: Kouanzhen, the seventh district of Taixing, is the only first town in the county. The Chamber of Commerce, which was originally organized, was restored and held its founding meeting on the 5th, electing Li Mingqi as the chairman of the association.</p>

<p>Hefei Correspondent: After taking office, the new Anhui Construction Department Director Liu Yiyan decided to widen the important streets of Hefei.

<h3>Negotiations on Manufacturing Railway Vehicles in Japan Completed Pending Approval; China to Supply High-Grade Industrial Coal</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 9th] Negotiations on the mass production of railway vehicles for China in Japan have been completed and are awaiting final approval from the Chinese Ministry of Efficiency. The negotiations stipulate that China will export high-grade industrial coal for use by Japanese factories and foundries. The railway vehicles they produce should be sold to China first. The Chinese government has requested that the railway vehicles be delivered within one year, but the Japanese Ministry of Commerce and Industry estimates that production and delivery will take two years, but the Chinese government still hopes that delivery can be completed within one year. The railway vehicle manufacturing plan is completely separate from the various compensation measures, and the compensation measures will take considerable time to implement one by one. According to the Chinese Mission in Japan, the plan to manufacture railway vehicles is by no means intended to allow China to take Japanese factories from Japan as compensation, keep them in Japan, and then use them to manufacture the goods needed by China. All negotiations were conducted by the Chinese Mission in Japan and the Industrial Section of the Economic and Scientific Group of the Allied Headquarters. Which Japanese company and factory will fulfill the Chinese government's orders has not yet been decided.</p>
<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>How to Dispose of a Defeated Japan?</h3>
<p>Foreign Minister Wang Shijie, head of the Chinese delegation to the peace conference, prioritizing official duties, departed yesterday to return to China. Before his departure, he met with American and French journalists and issued a statement clarifying China's policy toward Japan. The main points are sixfold: (1) Peace in the Far East depends greatly on the success of the Paris Peace Conference; (2) Although China suffered significant losses during the war, it will not demand reparations exceeding Japan's ability to pay; (3) When drafting the peace treaty with Japan, China will not adopt a policy of retribution; (4) The policies of China and the United States toward Japan are generally the same; (5) China supports the 25-year disarmament treaty for Japan proposed by the United States; (6) Peace cannot be maintained for long if it is not based on justice; the military defeat of the defeated country is not enough to guarantee world security.</p>
<p>Foreign Minister Wang's statement is full of a sense of justice. His ability to be so magnanimous toward a defeated enemy has garnered the attention and respect of countries around the world, and serves as a profound satire to the representatives of certain countries in Paris who want to impose harsh conditions on the defeated nations. However, the motive for Foreign Minister Wang's statement is merely to illustrate how concerned the Chinese government is about the success or failure of the Paris Peace Conference. Because under the current international relations, if the stalemate in Europe cannot be broken, the Far East problem cannot be solved independently. In other words, if this Paris Peace Conference cannot sign peace treaties with Italy, Romania, Hungary, Bulgaria, and Finland, then the peace treaty with Japan cannot be drafted. Although peace with Japan is theoretically simpler than peace with Germany, it will not be easy to solve if the relations between the great powers, especially between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, cannot be improved. The reason why Foreign Minister Wang supported the postponement of the United Nations General Assembly to October 23 at the Foreign Ministers' Meeting was nothing more than to urge politicians and diplomats from all countries to pay special attention to the Paris Peace Conference and concentrate their efforts so that the Paris Peace Conference could be successfully concluded as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Japan formally surrendered to the Allied forces on September 3 of last year, and surrendered to China on September 9. It has been exactly one year since then. Under the control of General Douglas MacArthur, Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces, defeated Japan has been able to steadily move towards the goals of the Allied control of Japan. Whether it is the dismantling of military forces, the elimination of defenses, the closure of munitions industries, the reorganization of heavy industry, the democratization of politics, or the re-education of the people to completely eliminate the aggressive ideology of the Japanese people, considerable achievements have been made. However, the problems that arise are: first, the Japanese people have not fully awakened and still do not admit defeat, and still believe that they can make a comeback in a few decades and appear on the international stage. Second, the peace treaty with Japan has not yet been drafted. Although the U.S. State Department has been collecting materials to prepare for the drafting of the peace treaty with Japan, looking ahead to the future of the world, it is not known when the Far East Peace Conference will be opened. Third, the policies of the United States and the Soviet Union toward Japan are completely diametrically opposed, even incompatible. The United States' control of Japan has been remarkably successful, and China and the United Kingdom have unanimously praised it; however, the Soviet Union has consistently expressed dissatisfaction and often attacked MacArthur for condoning Japan and fueling the rise of Japanese aggression. Fourth, the Korean issue, according to the declaration of the three foreign ministers in Moscow, Korea has been divided into two, with the north under Soviet control and the south under American control. How to achieve unity in the future in terms of economy and politics is indeed the most difficult problem.</p>
<p>China does not adopt a policy of revenge against defeated Japan, but can be magnanimous, which is commendable in terms of morality; however, we must pay attention that "magnanimity" is not "indulgence", let alone "appeasement". If we want to maintain peace in the Far East, we should always guard against Japan's rearmament and always pay attention to the rise of Japanese aggression. The most urgent problem for people is how to control Japan after the signing of the peace treaty with Japan. All of this should be considered before drafting the peace treaty. In particular, MacArthur issued a message on the first anniversary of Japan's surrender on September 3, saying: "Will Japan's position in the world in the future be a fortress of peace? Or will it become a springboard for war?" This warning is aimed at the four-power control commission of China, the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union, and it is worthy of our deep consideration.</p>

<h3>The Future of the Palestine Problem is Pessimistic. The London Conference Opened Yesterday. Neither Arab Nor Jewish Representatives Participated. It Has Become a Conversation Between Britain and the Vassal Arab Chiefs.</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper Report] Paris, 10th - London dispatch: The Palestine Conference opened this morning under clear skies. The area around Lancaster House was heavily guarded. Moments before 11 o'clock, the representatives of the Arab countries entered the venue, and Foreign Secretary Bevin also entered soon after. The conference began at precisely 11 o'clock. British Prime Minister Attlee delivered a speech first, receiving continuous applause that lasted for a long time before subsiding. The representatives then went to a lounge opposite the venue to rest. The lounge was decorated with a large rectangular table, adorned with a blue velvet tablecloth, red chairs, and filled with coffee cups and pots. The air was thick with the aroma of Turkish tobacco, creating a truly grand and luxurious atmosphere. As the representatives left the hall, Bevin commented, "The coffee tastes quite good." He was the first to return to the venue. A spokesperson for the Colonial Office announced at the end of this morning's meeting: The doors of Lancaster House remain open, and Jewish representatives are welcome to decide to participate at the last possible moment. The Executive Committee of the Jewish Agency met in London today. Local sources believe that the door to informal negotiations will remain open until the British government refuses to accept the Jewish counterproposal. These informal discussions can be seen as the basis for future formal meetings. However, British government officials stated that there have been too many informal talks, and the repeated holding of such informal talks should not cause people to doubt Britain's impartial and fair attitude in the Arab-Jewish conflict.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 10th] The Palestine Conference opened here today, with Prime Minister Attlee giving a speech, expressing the belief that the Palestine problem is not unsolvable. However, it requires the actions of highly skilled politicians to achieve a resolution. Representatives from neither the Palestinian Arab nor Jewish groups participated. A spokesperson for the Jewish Agency expressed doubt this morning that Jewish representatives would subsequently join the conference. When the representatives drove to the venue at Lancaster House this morning, there were few spectators, and the atmosphere was cold. The first to arrive were the representatives of Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Transjordan, Syria, Lebanon, Iraq, and the United Kingdom. After Attlee finished his speech, the chief representative of Syria stood up to thank him, and the meeting was immediately adjourned for a break.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 10th] The Palestine Conference opened here today in an atmosphere of pessimism, which British officials did not attempt to conceal. While it cannot be determined at this time whether representatives of the Jewish and Arab communities in Palestine will continue to refuse to attend, this possibility is extremely high. The current question is whether any positive results can be achieved simply by exchanging views between the British government and representatives of the Arab countries. British officials believe that exchanging views with influential representatives of the Arab world may yield beneficial results. The stark reality at today's meeting is that the conference cannot be considered a success if it concludes with an agreement between Britain and the Arab countries without the presence of Jewish representatives. However, even if this conference breaks down, it will only be a formal breakdown, as Britain can still seek opinions from all relevant parties and take the most practical administrative measures. The Arab countries can also file complaints with United Nations agencies, but if this stage is reached, it would be contrary to the purpose of this conference.</p>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 9th] Maurice, Secretary-General of the Hebrew National Liberation Association, who is participating in the peace conference as a journalist, said: The Palestine Conference that opened in London today has been reduced to a conversation between the British government and its vassal Arab feudal chiefs. British Foreign Secretary Bevin invited Atum, the Secretary-General of the Arab League, which cannot exist under international law. How can its representatives participate in the Palestine Conference? Its resolutions must be worthless.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Jerusalem, 9th] Jamal al-Husseini, Deputy Chairman of the Palestinian Arab Higher Committee, went to Amman, the capital of Transjordan, at the invitation of the King of Transjordan to discuss attending the London Conference. Al-Husseini remained resolute in his intention not to attend.</p>
<h3>Terrorist Activities are on the Rise. Martial Law is Declared Throughout Palestine. British Troops Arrive in Haifa to Conduct Searches.</h3>
<p>[United Press, Jerusalem, 9th] Terrorist activities in Palestine are on the rise. The British military headquarters here received a telegram from Tel Aviv tonight stating that the press office there had been destroyed. At the same time, Jewish terrorist groups announced to the newspapers today that they were responsible for yesterday's sabotage, aimed at opposing the London Conference and the British government's Palestine plan, saying that this plan would only bury peace in Palestine. Explosions and shootings occurred in various places in Palestine on the day the London Conference began, apparently as part of a large-scale Jewish terrorist operation.</p>
<p>[United Press, Jerusalem, 9th] Martial law has been declared throughout Palestine, and curfews are strictly enforced. Private cars are prohibited from traveling on highways. Railways have been cut and destroyed in more than fifty places, disrupting railway operations.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 8th, United Press] British troops are now heading to the port of Haifa in large numbers to search for the terrorists who killed a British army sergeant. 80,000 troops are now stationed in all key points in Palestine and can be mobilized at any time if necessary. Terrorist squads have been stationed at major railway stations to intercept the terrorists who widely attacked the railways early this morning and are now on the run.</p>
<h3>Ukraine's Accusation Rejected by British and American Representatives</h3>
<p>[United Press, New York, 9th] The United Nations Security Council today voted nine to one to invite the Albanian representative to attend the meeting to present his views on Ukraine's accusation against Greece and Britain. British representative Jebb cast the sole dissenting vote, and Jebb criticized Ukraine's suspicion of the recent referendum in Greece as "utter nonsense." American representative Johnson also firmly rejected Ukraine's accusations with surprising actions, believing that the accusations against the Greek referendum were "not true." According to the report of the American inspectors, there were very few illegal votes, which were not enough to change the outcome of the vote.</p>

<h3>Committees of the Peace Conference Meet, British and American Groups Take the Offensive, Britain and Brazil Abandon Reparation Claims Against Italy, Bulgaria's Demand for Territory from Greece is Criticized as Shameless</h3>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 9th] The peace conference has entered its seventh week, and the United Kingdom and the United States began a general offensive in various committees today, accusing the Soviet Union of wanting to give Greek territory to Bulgaria as a reward for aggression. Britain and Brazil also abandoned their direct reparation claims against Italy. Representatives from the United States, the United Kingdom, Brazil, and the Dominions spoke first in the various committees. The peace conference must end before October 20 in order to continue holding the United Nations General Assembly. Therefore, all peace treaty committees are meeting except for the Political Committee of the Finnish Treaty. South African representative Jordan praised Greece for its heroic resistance and called Bulgaria's territorial claims shameless. The British representative said that this was no different from Hungary's request for the port of Trieste as an outlet. U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union Smith opposed the Czech encroachment on Hungary in the Hungarian Treaty Political Committee, saying that the Czech proposal to expel Hungarian minorities should be discussed, as this would establish a dangerous principle of relocating minorities. When the United Kingdom canceled its reparation claims against Italy, it reserved the right to implement Article 69 of the Italian Treaty (according to this clause, all Allied countries or their allied countries have the right to claim compensation from Italy, and may withhold or otherwise dispose of the property rights and interests of Italy or the Italian people in their own countries, and the Italian government should compensate for the property of Italians that is disposed of as a result), allowing the United Kingdom to confiscate Italian assets in Allied countries and their colonies to offset war damages. The amount has not been announced, but some British sources estimate the value of Italian assets at only £2.5 million. The peace conference continued to discuss the Italian-Yugoslav border issue at the same time, seeking to quickly complete the draft treaties of the five major Axis powers. South African representative Eichelon, Chairman of the Italian Treaty Political Territory Committee, said that although there had been a lot of talk last week, the four-power proposal to make Trieste an international free port had not changed. Eichelon argued that the issue of determining the size of the boundaries of this free port should be resolved by a subcommittee. Yugoslav representative Pable said that the South delegation intends to divide its boundary issue into four parts and suggested that another subcommittee be established, consisting of the Soviet Union, the United States, the United Kingdom, France, China, Yugoslavia, Belarus, and Brazil, to handle this issue.</p>
<h3>Greece Proposes Amendment to Article 1 of the Treaty with Bulgaria</h3>
<p>[French News Agency, Paris, 9th] The Political and Territorial Committee of the Peace Conference on Bulgaria met today to discuss Article 1 of the treaty. Greek representative Pipinelis declared that, "We believe that the demands made by Bulgaria are unfair and have no basis. Regarding 'Bulgaria's outlet to the Aegean Sea', when the Lausanne Conference was held in 1923, our country had intended to grant Bulgaria certain conveniences, but this was rejected by the country. In any case, this outlet is not indispensable to Bulgaria, because its entire economic structure is tending towards Central Europe, and the Danube River and Black Sea ports are sufficient for its export needs. Our country proposes the following amendment to Article 1: 'The map attached to this treaty has indicated that the borders of Bulgaria will be the borders that existed before January 1, 1941, that is, the line from Belim - Palania - Dospat - Galek Balkan - to Dabesktipol to the Arda River Basin, which is the basis for the discussion of this committee. As for the 'freedom of the Macedonian people' claimed by Yugoslavia, it is similar to 'Hitler's terminology'." At this point, Belarusian representative Kiselev, the chairman of the committee, stopped him, saying that the last sentence was obviously insulting to the Yugoslav representative, and hoped that he would use more diplomatic language in his future speeches.</p>
<h3>Boundary Disputes Between Czechoslovakia and Hungary to be Studied by a Subcommittee</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 9th] The United States today supported the Czech demand in the peace conference that Hungary cede the Cakov region on the south bank of the Danube River across from the Slovak capital Bratislava. U.S. representative Smith said that the area of the region should be slightly smaller than that demanded by the Czech Republic, so that some villages inhabited by the Magyar people would remain within Hungarian territory. He further suggested that this matter should best be negotiated directly by the Czech and Hungarian governments, and the peace conference should postpone discussions on the matter for the time being. Czech representative Clementis added that the desire to expand Bratislava also had security implications, and he denied Hungary's claim that Czechoslovakia intended to break into Hungarian territory as a result. On the contrary, Czechoslovakia's intention was to amend Czechoslovakia's original protruding border. Clementis said that he did not object to an investigation of the matter by a subcommittee. Finally, it was decided to establish a subcommittee composed of Australia, New Zealand, Ukraine, Canada, and Czechoslovakia to study the Czech request.</p>
<h3>US Refuses to Publish the Situation of Overseas Troops</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper Report] Washington, 10th - The United States has flatly opposed the Soviet Union's request that all countries publish the strength and deployment of their troops stationed abroad (excluding former occupied areas).

<h3>Foreign Minister Wang's Remarks Before Leaving France: Peace Should be Based on Justice. Peace Between Germany and Japan is Difficult to Expect Without Improving Relations Between the Great Powers. Our Internal Problems Should be Resolved Through Political Means.</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Paris, 9th Special Dispatch] Our Foreign Minister Wang Shijie yesterday separately met with a reporter from the French semi-official newspaper Le Monde, saying that peace in the Far East depends greatly on the success of this peace conference. On the eve of his return to China, Foreign Minister Wang separately met with interviewers from the French newspaper Le Monde, the British London Times, and the American New York Times, and issued statements. Wang spoke a lot to the Le Monde interviewer, from his impression of France after liberation, his views on the Paris Peace Conference, to the Chinese Communist Party issue, and so on. Le Monde placed Wang's remarks on the front page of its newspaper today. Wang said in his remarks: If the five-nation treaty can be signed and established, then the relations between the great powers can be improved. If the politicians of the above-mentioned powers can understand at this moment how to benefit from this situation and can redouble their efforts to create sincere cooperation, then I can assert that it will not be too difficult to reach an agreement when dealing with the more important and more difficult issues of Germany and Japan in the future. Wang continued: Peace with Japan is easy, the issue of compensation is less complicated, and the issues of territory and others are the same, but Wang reiterated that peace with Germany and Japan cannot be achieved without an improvement in relations between the great powers, because without an atmosphere of mutual trust, everything is impossible. On the contrary, if this kind of good atmosphere is created, everything can become simple. When the Le Monde interviewer asked what China's attitude towards Japan after the defeat was, Wang replied: China does not believe in a policy of retaliation. China provides assistance to Japanese democrats and allows them to consolidate their positions. The interviewer then asked whether he was satisfied with the current US policy towards Japan. Wang replied: The policies of China and the United States towards Japan are generally the same.</p>
<p>Regarding his impression of France after liberation, Wang said: The speed of France's political and economic recovery is unexpected. He was very pleased that Paris and other major French cities were not damaged. When mentioning the Chinese Communist Party issue, he said that the central government's position is that China's internal problems can only be resolved through peaceful and political means. I personally believe in patience, because time can help solve the problem. Wang's topic shifted from the Dutch East Indies to the Vietnam issue, saying that he also hoped that the Dutch East Indies and the Vietnam issue could be resolved peacefully. Wang concluded: I firmly believe that France knows how to express its historical spirit of justice and freedom. Although the difficulties ahead are great, they are not impossible to overcome.</p>
<p>[French News Agency, Paris, 9th] Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Shijie recently issued a statement to a reporter from Le Monde, saying that peace in the Far East depends greatly on the success of the Paris Peace Conference. Looking at the main issues faced by the representatives of various countries in the Luxembourg Palace, it can be seen that peace cannot last if it is not based on justice. The so-called justice is that all countries, both small and defeated, should be treated fairly. If there are still hidden dangers in the defeated countries, then their military defeat is not enough to guarantee European security. I think the Paris Peace Conference has respected this principle. Although there have been heated debates at this conference, I think the solutions proposed by the four powers are generally good, but it is regrettable that the conference's discussion of the problem of Italy's former colonies has been decided to be postponed. The Chinese delegation suggested that the peace conference should immediately make Libya, Italy's former colony, independent. If this is not possible, it should be submitted to the United Nations for trusteeship for several years before declaring independence.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 10th] The famous afternoon newspaper Tokyo Shimbun today published Foreign Minister Wang Shijie's statement in Paris in a very prominent position, saying that China's demand for reparations from Japan will not exceed Japan's ability to pay. The small newspaper Minpo also published Wang's remarks in a prominent position.</p>

<h3>International Tribunal Exposes Japanese Conspiracy: Behind-the-Scenes Establishment of Puppet Regimes; Konoe's Broadcast Provides Clear Evidence of Warmongering</h3>
<p>[Kaizo Sha, Tokyo, 10th] Prosecutors at the Far East International Tribunal today presented records held by the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, revealing the behind-the-scenes work of Japan in establishing puppet regimes in China. According to the records, regarding North China, in the 26th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1937], the Japanese side conspired to induce Wang Kemin to form a puppet regime in North China. At that time, Wang was living in Hong Kong, and after being incited by Ki Tada, head of the special agency stationed in Peiping [Beijing], and Yamamoto Eiji, Wang finally decided to take on the position in the puppet regime, and the puppet Provisional Government was established on December 14th. Regarding Central China, the puppet Dadao Government was formed through the efforts of the puppet mayor Su Xiwén, Japanese army attaché Colonel Kusumoto, and staff headquarters Colonel Kagezuo. The puppet Shanghai War Zone Relief and Rehabilitation Committee, with Zhang Xiaolin's Green Gang forces as its background and with Yu Qiaqing and others as its center, attempted to establish a puppet regime, but failed. Kan’no Osato, Yamada Junzaburo, and others conspired to support Tang Shaoyi, and Ju Zheng and others of the Xishan faction to establish a puppet regime, but also failed. Secondly, Zhou Zuomin and other figures in the Shanghai financial community plotted to probe President Chiang's intentions towards Japan in order to make contact with the Japanese side, but it did not materialize. In addition, Xiong Bin was active in Shanghai, plotting to form the so-called "Jiangsu Public Security Maintenance Association" and conspiring to contact He Yingqin. Moreover, Kobe overseas Chinese from the Wang Jingwei faction also conspired to contact Japanese people in Shanghai. Later, Liang Hongzhi, Ren Yuandao, Chen Qun, Wen Zongyao, and others formed the puppet Reformed Government on March 28th of the 31st year [of the Republic, i.e., 1942].</p>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 10th] The Far East International Military Tribunal continued its trial of Japanese war criminals this morning. The prosecution presented numerous pieces of evidence proving how Japan carried out economic aggression in Manchuria and North China, and explained that Japan possessed almost superhuman power in intelligence and military affairs. According to the broadcast speech by former Japanese Prime Minister Konoe, which was presented by the prosecution, the Japanese domestic public absolutely trusted the soldiers on the front lines, silently engaged in wartime production, and prepared for a long-term war, at which time we could repeatedly demonstrate the inherent spirit of Japan. History shows us that the rise and fall of our national fortune depends on whether our entire nation can recognize the Japanese national polity. Konoe's speech also mentioned the fall of Guangzhou and Hankou, and stated, "From now on, the Chinese government will only be a local regime, and Japan has not exhausted its military strength, yet has already achieved this effect. This is due to the sacred virtue of His Majesty the Emperor, which makes us feel extremely moved."</p>

<h3>Taiwanese Millionaire Gao Conducts Illegal Activities in Japan</h3>
<p>Delegation Leader Zhu Requests Allied Headquarters to Investigate</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 9th] Zhu Shiming, head of our delegation to Japan, has cabled the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission suggesting that Gao Yuzhao (transliteration), a Taiwanese millionaire residing in Tokyo, be stripped of all titles and honors, because Mr. Gao is engaged in various illegal activities in Tokyo and has not stopped despite repeated warnings.

<h3>British Communist Party Leads "Squatting" Movement: Cabinet Discusses Countermeasures</h3>
<p>[United Press, London, 9th] The British Cabinet held a special meeting today to discuss strategies to deal with the Communist Party-led "squatting" movement. The aim of the squatters is to seize vacant houses, especially luxurious apartments, the rent of which is more than 10 pounds per week. Even as Prime Minister Attlee and his cabinet members were meeting, four houses were invaded in the Kingston area. Yesterday, 800 squatters occupied several luxurious apartment buildings in the Kingston area and two houses in the Feltham area, with 1,000 men, women, and children moving in during the 24 hours. This large-scale squatting movement is part of the Communist Party's new movement of "direct action." There are at least 250,000 households in London still looking for housing. According to those in charge, occupying private property is different from occupying public property, and the owners should legally evict the squatters.</p>

<h3>Successful Determination of a Large State-Run Enterprise: The Grassroots System of the United States (Part 1)</h3>
<p>—Special Correspondent Mao Shuqing's Dispatch—</p>
<p>[Knoxville, Tennessee, August 15th] During my ten-day stay in Tennessee, I was most interested in two things: first, the great dam construction and its inexhaustible source of power; second, these noisy American children who felt an unparalleled freshness and interest in state-run enterprises. This is a miracle. From the founding of the United States to now, it is the first time that such a large-scale enterprise has been run by the state. When I was in New York and Chicago, I heard many American friends talk about it, half of whom were still dubious about the success or failure of the TVA. Many Americans slandered the TVA as the most foolish act in the world. They said: How can enterprises be run by the government? Politicians themselves do not understand "the way to create wealth!" On my first day in Knoxville, I directly asked Mr. Tingli, the deputy director of the information department, and he said: The slander of the TVA from the outside is not just one or two isolated opinions. "They have organized groups. You are a news reporter, so you naturally understand what propaganda is." He picked up a booklet and shook it, saying: "Enough to see, the power of propaganda is very great!" This small book is called "Dangerous TVA," written by a man named Edwin Vernate. Afterwards, I learned that Forgett was the "spokesman" for the Midwestern electric power company in the United States. Forgett wrote this book and has already become a multimillionaire in the United States. People in the TVA want to spit on the name of Forgett, but American capitalist trust giants are reading Forgett's book like the Bible, introducing and promoting it. Henry sent me a TVA mimeograph, a full twenty pages and thousands of words of "Rebuttal," which was only published in April of this year and was the TVA's first rebuttal to external insults. It began by saying: In the United States, there is a force that is attacking the TVA's state-run enterprises. They fabricate rumors and slander out of thin air to promote the failure and collapse of the TVA. He also listed the members of this opposing force, including: Edison Electric Company, National Electric Power Company Federation, US Chamber of Commerce, Water Power Committee, Federation of 31 Water Companies, and many other agencies with conflicting interests. In addition to commercial agencies jointly opposing the TVA, the rebuttal also listed an article in Harper's Magazine, written by Clayton, an editor of Harper's Magazine and a social economist. After examining the TVA, Clayton believed that this state-run enterprise would fail. He looked at it from an economic point of view and listed many figures, saying that the TVA's management methods were unreasonable, saying: "The power company bosses must be clapping and cheering after seeing my critical article, but I declare: I am not writing it for their applause, I am simply discussing the matter as it is." The rebuttal, from the current financial situation, management methods, and preparations for repaying principal and interest, was written in detail, stating that the TVA's management was not only beneficial but also benefited the people. I do not intend to copy these figures, because I think that more worthy of our attention than repaying principal and interest is the management and organization of state-run enterprises. Since its establishment in 1933, the TVA has undergone one change after another in its organization. Even now, senior TVA officials dare not say that their current system is a perfect and ideal system. However, because of the TVA's continuous improvement and experimentation, Americans have begun to understand what state-run enterprises are all about. At the same time, the TVA's own repeated attempts and improvements have promoted the growth of its business. In Tennessee, you can hear the word "grassroots" everywhere. The meaning of grassroots is not the so-called "bark and roots" in Chinese dictionaries, but a symbol of the form of an organizational structure. The roots penetrate deep into the soil, develop around, and leave a root system that is independent and unconnected. This is the organizational spirit of the TVA. For thirteen years, the TVA has grown from a very small unit to its current scale, thanks to the organizational principle of the so-called "grassroots system." Who started using the word "grassroots?" I cannot investigate. However, I know that the current chairman of the TVA, Mr. Li Lingsu, is a proponent of the grassroots system. Before Li Lingsu Han served as a director of the TVA, he advocated a system of political decentralization. He opposed the federal government's system of centralization of power in the United States. He said: If the administrative efficiency of the United States is to be enhanced, it must realize "democratic politics of the grassroots system." Last year, Li Lingsu wrote a book called "Democracy on the March—TVA." In addition to describing the construction of the TVA, this book particularly emphasizes the economic democracy of the United States, that is, the national socialization of the economy. He said a lot about administrative management and administrative efficiency, and explained a lot about the principles of the grassroots system. I talked about the "grassroots system" with many friends of the TVA. I feel that the concept of the grassroots system is very similar to China's system of tiered responsibility. For example, under the TVA, there is now a very large section called the "Power Department." When it was first established, the unit managing electricity was very small and was originally attached to the board of directors. Later, as the dams were completed one after another, electricity became the main part of the TVA. Due to needs, it gradually expanded and developed to become the large organization that the Power Department is today. The director of the Power Department is the dictator of all power-related matters of the TVA. The director is responsible to the general manager, and the general manager is responsible to the chairman, but the director of the Power Department does not need to "request instructions," "submit judgments," or "authorize" for matters related to electricity. For example, under the Power Department, there are now three sections: the Power Utilization Section, the Power Management Section, and the Engineering Construction Section. The section chief has full authority to handle matters within the scope of one section. The section chief has the right to send documents externally. Sometimes, a section chief's phone call, without any official documents at all, does not require the section chief to review and authorize it. The result of tiered responsibility is that responsibility is clear, each other cannot shirk responsibility, administrative efficiency is fast, and business development is easy.</p>

Any special proposals not belonging to any group would be reviewed by the first group. The secretariat would appoint one secretary to each group to take minutes.</p>
<p>Regarding the administrative reports of the bureau chiefs, councilors expressed that they took up too much time, affecting inquiries and answers. It was resolved that when the bureau chiefs reported, the oral supplementary report should be limited to one hour in addition to the written report. Therefore, at the fourth meeting in the afternoon, Health Bureau Chief Zhang Wei reported that since the actual work overview had been published in writing, only two additional points were supplemented. A total of 68 written inquiries related to health were received, which will be answered after the report from the Land Administration Bureau Chief this morning. Director Xuan then answered inquiries, and any that could not be answered orally would be answered in writing.</p>
<p>Councilors Tao Baichuan, Qu Yuè, Zhan Wenhu, and Lu Shidao expressed different opinions on the issue of the letter from the Suzhou-Zhejiang-Anhui Region Receiving Work Investigation Team requesting the dispatch of one city councilor to participate in the investigation, and it was decided to leave it for discussion today.</p>
<p>Today's agenda includes: the fifth meeting in the morning will be a report from Land Administration Bureau Chief Zhu Ping, and the Health Bureau Chief answering questions. The sixth meeting in the afternoon will be a report from Finance Bureau Chief Gu Chunfan, and Director Zhu answering questions, with time for discussions and reports in between.</p>

<h3>Police Chief Xuan Tiewu's Administrative Report: Three Principles, Eight Sections, Five Key Points</h3>
<p>Police Chief Xuan Tiewu's report on the work of the Municipal Police Bureau from September 1945 to August 1946 stated: From the beginning of our takeover, the Bureau has been based on the duties of consolidating security, maintaining order, improving customs, and implementing administrative orders, in order to eliminate chaos, transform the environment, and lay the foundation for a new administration. Based on the national policy guidelines and the actual needs of the locality, the following three policy principles were formulated: 1. Strengthen police force, enrich equipment, eliminate bandits, and stabilize social order. 2. Prohibit opium and gambling, ban private prostitution, eradicate bad habits, and create a good atmosphere. 3. Improve the quality of the police, strengthen the training of new police, and promote remedial education in order to fulfill their responsibilities.</p>
<p>The Police Bureau, in accordance with the above policy principles, formulated core tasks. The implementation overview is divided into eight sections: security, social customs, fire prevention, opium prohibition, traffic, city appearance, organization and training, and personnel, which are summarized as follows:</p>
<p>Security: 1. Deploy police force, establish police stations, increase water sub-bureaus and substations, and use the two security police corps, patrol teams, and riding training teams in coordination. 2. Inspect civilian guns, issue gun licenses, and confiscate unlicensed guns and ammunition. 3. Intensify the arrest of bandits.</p>
<p>Social Customs: 1. Reorganize prostitutes, implement management based on the three principles of "turning private into public," "simplifying complexity," and "integrating fragmentation." Conduct a pilot program for public prostitutes, strictly prohibit private prostitution, and crack down on disguised prostitution, only allowing customers within the brothel. 2. Manage dance halls, register dancers, review qualifications, and issue business licenses. 3. Ban morning dances. 4. Ban illegal and pornographic publications.</p>
<p>Fire Prevention: Fire prevention is extremely important in municipal administration, directly affecting the safety of citizens' lives and property. 1. Fire prevention is more important than fire rescue, so fire prevention is intensified. 2. Life rescue: There are 17 ambulances, dedicated to rescuing acute infectious diseases, traffic accidents, and various accidents.</p>
<p>Opium Prohibition: 1. Conduct registration of opium addicts for self-renewal. 2. Investigate and arrest opium and drug offenders. 3. Investigate and verify registered opium addicts.</p>
<p>Traffic: 1. Limit vehicle speed. 2. Stipulate one-way lanes. 3. Restrict human-powered carts from driving in the city. 4. Improve traffic facilities. 5. Strengthen traffic direction.</p>
<p>City Appearance: Because this city is an international metropolis, and the appearance is particularly important to domestic and foreign observers. 1. Stipulate the method of hanging national flags, with uniform national flag sizes, uniform flagpole colors, and uniform flag heights. 2. Set up announcement sites, a total of 308 locations. Notices, announcements, advertisements, etc. must be posted at the announcement sites. 3. Crack down on illegal shacks.</p>
<p>Organization and Training: To establish a sound police system, it is necessary to strengthen organization and training work. 1. Adjust the structure. 2. Implement training. 3. Organize voluntary police. Organizational training is particularly important in order to eliminate the corrupt patrol room style of the past.</p>
<p>Personnel: 1. Implement layoffs and streamline administration. 2. Establish a personnel system. The appointment, removal, reward, punishment, promotion, demotion, transfer, retirement, and compensation of personnel are all based on a certain procedure.</p>
<p>Finally, Director Xuan briefly reported on the points to be discussed by the Interim Council, divided into five points: administrative part, criminal part, fire prevention part, personnel part, and the implementation of the police officer system.</p>
<p>After the report was completed, Speaker Pan announced a ten-minute break.</p>
<h3>Seeking Welfare for Female Workers: Tang Guifen's Proposal</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper] Tang Guifen, a current female staff member in the finishing department of the Tongyi Yarn Factory, told reporters yesterday: Female workers in the city's cotton spinning and weaving industry account for about 80% of the total number of workers. Among them, half have children and need to bear the burden of family life. Most female workers hope that the community will open childcare centers for workers, but because it is not easy to organize on a large scale, they request that they be established in factories or various units. Ms. Tang mentioned this point in her written proposal to this conference and requested that working hours be reduced to ten hours. This is the minimum requirement. If possible, the general female workers deeply hope that working hours can be reduced to eight hours, and the extra time can be used for schooling.</p>
<h3>City Government Bureaus' Expenditure Usage: Assembly Demands Detailed Reports</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The Shanghai Municipal Government's general budget for revenue and expenditure for the second half of the 35th year of the Republic has already been distributed to the city councilors yesterday afternoon by the municipal government for research and review. Before the adjournment, Councilor He Chengfu proposed a temporary motion requesting each bureau of the municipal government to provide detailed reports on financial expenditures and their usage for review purposes. Speaker Pan immediately agreed to submit this motion to all bureaus of the municipal government, requesting each bureau to submit expenditure reports to the Ninth Group for review by the Municipal Budget and Final Accounts Committee. Bureaus that have already presented their reports are still required to submit supplementary reports on this matter.</p>
<p>Councilor Wang Wei expressed to reporters that, regarding necessary business expenses, he hopes the municipal government will not reduce or eliminate them due to insufficient income. Instead, new taxes should be levied to provide additional funding.</p>
<h3>Four Major Airfields' Occupied Land Will Not Be Returned: To Be Requisitioned According to Law</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The Jiangwan, Hongqiao, Longhua, and Dachang airfields in this city were occupied by the enemy and puppet regimes during the occupation period, and a large amount of surrounding civilian land was forcibly seized. According to Article 5 of the "Measures for Clearing Land Rights in Recovered Areas": "Privately owned land confiscated or forcibly occupied by enemy and puppet organizations shall be returned to the owners upon presentation of ownership certificates. If there are circumstances under Article 208 or 209 of the Land Law, it may be requisitioned according to law." Article 208 of the Land Law stipulates that the state may requisition privately owned land for public works (national defense, transportation, public utilities, water conservancy, etc.). Article 209 of the Land Law stipulates that the government may requisition privately owned land for the implementation of national economic policies.</p>
<p>Regarding the aforementioned occupied civilian land, the Municipal Land Administration Bureau, after Director Zhu took office, immediately submitted a request to the municipal government to forward it to the Air Force's important bases. Longhua has been designated as a civil aviation airfield, so the occupied land cannot be returned. The municipal government should complete the requisition procedures in accordance with the law. These procedures include surveying, investigating land registration, public announcements, and valuation. The Air Force Commission has agreed to bear the surveying costs for the Hongqiao and Longhua airfields, and the budget for this was submitted by the Land Administration Bureau to the municipal government and forwarded to the Air Force authorities in July of this year. Work will begin as soon as the funds are allocated. The bureau is currently in contact with the Air Force authorities regarding the other airfields.</p>
<h3>Reading Reports Like Giving a Lecture: Economic Time, Back to the Point</h3>
<p>When Director Xuan Tiewu presented his report yesterday, he read verbatim from the printed written report. Some councilors were reading newspapers, some were writing, and some said it was very much like attending a lecture.</p>
<p>When Director Zhang Wei of the Health Bureau presented his report, he cited extensively from various sources. The councilors probably thought he was "too far off topic." Zhao Yangyun, considering the economic time, said, "Director Zhang, please get back to the point."</p>
<p>There were more than ten large statistical charts hung on the walls of the meeting hall by the Police Bureau and the Health Bureau.</p>
<p>During the morning session, as Mayor Wu was responding to the questions raised by the councilors the day before, it was pouring rain outside. When the mayor was responding to the "chaos" issue raised by Tao Baichuan, there was a sudden clap of thunder that startled everyone. Later, when explaining the cost of living index, there were two more consecutive thunderclaps.</p>
<p>Tao Baichuan's seat was the last one in the hall, number 175, but he often made shocking remarks when he spoke.</p>
<p>Director Xuan said in his report: "Waitresses, what Shanghai people call 'glass cups', are the most harmful things to public morals."</p>
<p>Director Xuan also said: "Once, at a fire, the fire brigade arrived but could not start rescue operations immediately because there was no water in the hydrants. There were rumors that they demanded 40 million [currency not specified], but I can guarantee that there was no such thing."</p>
<p>Councilwoman Tian Shujun, originally seat number 159, moved to seat number 166 in the back yesterday afternoon to accompany Councilwoman Tong Daoyun. But at 4:20 PM, Tong Xiang took seat 166 as a non-voting attendee, and Ms. Tian had to give up her seat and "return to her original seat." After returning to her seat, she exchanged teacups. Councilor Pang Jingzhou, after Director Zhang Wei of the Health Bureau reported on his administration yesterday afternoon, buried himself in his work, putting his glasses on his forehead, looking very nervous, probably writing some inquiry draft.</p>
<h3>Snippets from the Meeting</h3>
<p>Mayor Wu's attitude was calm, concise, and to the point when answering various inquiries yesterday, which was admirable. When the mayor answered Zhang Xuelian's question, "Can the mayor be more accessible to the public? The mayor's proximity to the district chiefs is tantamount to being in constant contact with the public." The mayor said: I think that statement is "absolutely correct."</p>
<p>In the Yiyuan meeting hall, there was a cup of plain tea in the morning on both the previous day and yesterday, but yesterday afternoon it was suddenly replaced with a cup of regular black tea.</p>
<p>Director Zhang Wei of the Health Bureau attended the report, accompanied by the chief secretary and four department heads, to be prepared to answer the inquiries of the councilors.</p>
<h3>"Glass Cups" Carry Heavy Sins: Thunderstorms Startle Everyone</h3>
<p>A few minutes before the adjournment of the third general assembly, Councilor Lu Enze fired a shot, questioning the mayor as to why he pushed away the grain loan case so cleanly. At the adjournment, Mayor Wu rushed to Councilor Lu's seat to explain that the grain loan case was indeed not related to the municipal government, and all the case files were not in the municipal government, so there was no way to report on the facts of the grain loan case.</p>
<p>A certain councilor used his social skills to distribute cards and invitations to some reporters.</p>
<h3>Mayor's Oral Responses to Inquiries: Shared Opinion on the Situation of "Chaos": Urban Plan to Be Completed Next Year</h3>
<p>The mayor's oral responses to the inquiries of the councilors the day before can be summarized as follows: (1) Hawker problem: Those who are being suppressed are hawkers with significant capital, because they obstruct legitimate commerce and are outlets for stolen goods from the docks. However, small food stalls and cigarette stands set up by poor people will not be suppressed for the time being. As for the method of centralized operation, the first thing to consider is whether the source of the goods is legitimate, and the second is whether they can pay taxes in accordance with the business tax law. (2) Housing problem: The Housing Allocation Committee has taken over more than 6,000 buildings in the Hongkou district, and a detailed list will be announced in mid-September. After the municipal government takes over, it will strictly implement the allocation process. In addition to negotiating with their superior agencies regarding the situation of certain agencies forcibly occupying houses, it also hopes to impose sanctions. On the one hand, it will encourage construction in the hope of fundamentally solving the problem. (3) Food problem: There have been rumors in the city again in the past few days, and it is hoped that everyone will not believe them lightly. Rice prices did not rise the day before yesterday, and the South Market even fell by about 4,000 yuan. Taiwan rice and other rice can be transported in, and the new year's grain can also be launched at the end of September. In the future, if rice prices are unstable, the rationing system will still be adopted.</p>
<p>(4) Labor-management issues will be handled in accordance with central laws and regulations. The recent barbershop dispute, after arbitration, has not shown any changes in fact. (5) The He Dehui case was reported to the central government by the Political Participation Council. The Ministry of Judicial Administration has sent personnel to Shanghai to investigate, and it will be fully announced soon. (6) The grain loan case is not within the scope of the municipal government's authority and is inconvenient to answer. (7) Regarding the municipal government itself: First, the Industrial and Trust Company was established during the tenure of the previous mayor. The original work was municipal ferry and land requisition and sale in the central area of ​​the city. The current work is building affordable housing villages. Second, there will be measures to deal with those who served in puppet organizations recently promulgated by the central government, which will be handled accordingly. Third, the handling fee for the Property Management Office of the Occupied Territories was determined during the term of the previous mayor to compensate for the costs of point checking and moving. The original amount was 3 million yuan, which has now been reduced to 1 million yuan or 2 million yuan. The accounts will be disclosed. Fourth, the cost-of-living index is calculated based on major items such as rice and cloth and is a statistical issue. As for shortening the publication period, it is feared that it will stimulate public sentiment and is not intended to be implemented. (8) Regarding the situation of "chaos," I also agree and am trying my best to seek order and stability from chaos, hoping to cooperate with the councilors. (9) The property of the former concession is now handled by the Liquidation Committee, but there have been slight changes in the organization recently. (10) Strict suppression of unauthorized construction of shantytowns, while encouraging legal construction. (11) Strict suppression of theft at the docks, and the Port Committee will be established soon. (12) It is hoped that the entire urban plan will be completed before the third council meeting next year.</p>
<h3>List of Conveners for Each Group Review Committee</h3>

<h3>Should We Participate in the Investigation Team? Councilors Have Different Opinions: Tao Baichuan Thinks the Investigation Team Is Ineffective: First Ask How Many Days of Life Are Left?</h3>
<p>The most exciting scene of yesterday's conference was near the adjournment in the afternoon. The clock had pointed to 5:30. Before announcing the adjournment, the Speaker said that there was something to report. He read the letter from the Su, Zhejiang, and Anhui District Receiving Materials Investigation Team. The content was to invite the Municipal Council to select a councilor to participate in their investigation work.</p>
<p>The Speaker asked everyone how to select this councilor to participate in the investigation work. At that time, some advocated using a ballot, and everyone did not seem to consider whether it was "possible" to accept the request of the investigation team. However, suddenly, Tao Baichuan stood up in an unexpected posture and expressed his explosive opinion.</p>
<p>He said: "Regarding the establishment of the Receiving Materials Investigation Team, I once opposed it when I participated in the Political Participation Council as a councilor, because I thought that the investigation team would never have any effect, but my opinion was not adopted. Now, from the facts, the investigation team has indeed not had any effect. In the future, when it writes its report, it will say that the receiving situation is very good, and it will be worthwhile to bear legal responsibility for others for nothing. Moreover, the investigation team is about to end soon and will return to Nanjing from Hangzhou soon. We are even less worthy of sending someone to participate at this time and bear legal responsibility for those who have made a fortune from the victory!"</p>
<p>Before he finished speaking, he received warm applause from the audience. When the Speaker asked if anyone seconded his opinion, the councilors raised their hands one after another, and their expressions were very excited. It seemed that Tao Baichuan's opinion could be passed. However, unexpectedly, Qu Yue, who wore glasses and looked somewhat like an old scholar, stood up.</p>
<p>He said that he opposed Tao's opinion and that this opinion was the style of irresponsible old-style bureaucrats. He said that it was precisely because we knew that there were problems with receiving enemy and puppet materials, and precisely because the work of the investigation team had no results, that we should send someone to participate and see what was going on!</p>
<p>Qu Yue's words also made sense, and the councilors' emotions were obviously disordered. There were also people who seconded him. At this time, Zhan Wenhuan stood up and added:</p>
<p>Zhan said: "It is a fact that the receiving situation is not satisfactory. The investigation team is relatively unfamiliar with some things. To conduct a serious investigation, there must be people who really understand the inside story. Therefore, I advocate that we should either not accept the invitation of the investigation team, or if we accept it, it is not enough to send one person to go. We want to send five to seven people to go and seriously investigate."</p>
<p>Lu Shidao's opinion went even further. He said: "We should either not be involved in the receiving matter, or if we investigate, we must find out the result. However, the investigation team's method is stipulated by the central government. If we send someone to go, we will still be subject to restrictions. If they want to go east, we go east, and if they want to go west, we go west. We will definitely not get any results in the old way. Therefore, I advocate that if we want to investigate, we should submit a request to the government to let our council investigate ourselves."</p>
<p>It was already 5:45. The Speaker announced that there are now four different opinions. Due to time constraints, it will be put to a vote tomorrow morning. Before the adjournment, Tao Baichuan added one point. He asked Speaker Pan to ask the investigation team two questions before putting this issue to a vote tomorrow: First, how much life does the investigation team have left? Second, is the nature of the investigation team's invitation to the council to send someone to participate only in an assistant position?</p>
<h3>To Compete With the World, We Still Need to Work Hard for Twenty Years: Zhang Wei Reports on Health: Believes That Eliminating Corruption Requires First Fostering Integrity</h3>
<p>The fourth meeting continued at 3:00 PM. Councilor Hou Yuan proposed to cancel the oral reports of each bureau director to save time. However, Jiang Huaisu stood up and said that oral reports are still needed, but it is not necessary to read the written report verbatim, but to supplement the shortcomings of the written report. Speaker Pan then issued a statement that this matter is related to the agenda of the General Assembly, and each bureau director has been notified to attend the report, so the oral report should still be available, but it must supplement the shortcomings of the written report and must not exceed one hour.</p>
<p>Then, Director Zhang Wei of the Health Bureau reported. Director Zhang said that Shanghai has a population of more than 4 million, and health work is extremely heavy. During the 80 days of taking office, he has not only failed to make any achievements, but has not even become familiar with the doorway. Most of the time has been spent searching for the source of the disease and dealing with temporary problems. The fundamental solution is only now being carried out. Although everyone is working harder, there are still not many achievements due to a lack of conditions. The city treasury is empty, and the situation is difficult.</p>
<p>At present, striving for material funding, technology and time is extremely urgent, and psychological construction is even more important. Greed, exploitation, deception, fraud, decadence, decline, extravagance, and licentiousness are all bad habits that can hinder the progress of work.</p>
<p>Of course, this also has its external reasons, that is, the treatment is meager and insufficient to maintain life. May I ask, how can a cleaner live on a monthly income of more than 90,000 yuan? For example, the salary of a nurse in our bureau is only 200,000 yuan per month, while a special nurse can earn 50,000 yuan per day. Therefore, if we want to eliminate corruption and have a clean atmosphere, we must increase treatment so that we can foster integrity.</p>
<p>Let us think, why were there fewer corrupt things before the war? Why do we know about these malpractices, but not disclose them? Or use appropriate methods to make illegal activities legal?</p>
<p>The urgent task is to vigorously carry out psychological construction, and then strive for material conditions. Twenty years later, we will surely be able to compete with other major cities in the world?</p>
<p>What I am talking about today is not a work report, but a statement of attitude. Please, councilors, make some corrections. To eliminate corruption, we must stabilize life. To do things, we must first have tools, so we must have money and have enough time to complete the work. Director Zhang finished in a hurry, and Director Xuan answered questions.</p>
<p>As for the Health Bureau's written work report, it includes: Adjusting, implementing cadres; uniting forces, facilities. Borrowing tools, improving street cleaning and other ten items. And record the relevant work digits.</p>
<h3>Playing Mahjong with Four People Is Not Considered Gambling: Dog Racing and Horse Racing Are All Prohibited: The Extortion of Misconduct by Unscrupulous Police Officers Has Not Been Eradicated: Director Xuan's Oral Response to Councilor Inquiries</h3>
<p>The councilors submitted a total of 84 written questions to the Police Bureau, and Director Xuan answered them orally one by one. There was a ten-minute break in the middle. Finally, due to lack of time, some items were changed to written replies. The main contents of yesterday's reply are as follows: (1) Drug use and drug trafficking cases are being severely arrested, and it is hoped that the people will report and assist. There are currently more than 6,000 drug addicts, but only a few hundred have been rehabilitated, which is due to the small scale of the rehabilitation center. It is now planned to request the municipal government to allocate funds to add more facilities and cooperate with the Health Bureau, hoping to eliminate them within two years.</p>
<p>(2) The extortion of misconduct by unscrupulous police officers has not been eradicated, and this trend must be rectified. It is also hoped that the people will report. (3) In terms of traffic, there are currently 888 traffic police officers. Depending on the situation of each intersection, one to six people are placed. However, the fundamental difficulty is still the narrowness of the roads, the excessive number of vehicles, and the fact that most do not follow the rules. As for the installation of automatic traffic lights, there is currently no financial capacity for this. (4) Regarding the prostitution problem, we can only start with public prostitutes first, ordering them to register and be inspected before issuing licenses. As for private prostitutes, of course, they will still be strictly prohibited. (5) Regarding the suppression of gambling, some places have broken through the face and enforced it, but the civil law stipulates that playing mahjong with four people is not considered gambling, so unless the law is amended, it cannot be enforced. Other activities such as jai alai, dog racing, and horse racing are also being suppressed. (6) The recently implemented method of managing second-hand stores is very helpful in cracking theft cases. (7) Regarding the police bureau's staffing, the number of police officers has not yet reached the quota. There are only more than 5,000 real criminal police officers. Some people say that there are too many police bureau staff. In fact, it is not that there are too many staff, but that there are too few police officers. It is hoped that they will be gradually supplemented within three years. (8) There is a detailed inventory of the property and materials received from the puppet police bureau. There are a total of more than 9,700 guns inside. (10) The police bureau runs its own children's school. Some people questioned it as a manifestation of feudal thought. In fact, because there are not enough schools in the city, and at the same time to reduce the burden on police officers, it is actually promoting education.</p>

<p>Yiyuan Operates as Usual at Night</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The venue for this session of the Municipal Council is the Yiyuan Hotel on Fuxing Middle Road. The hotel, in view of the fact that the Council is a public opinion organization, generously leases it out for a fee of only 250,000 yuan per day. Apart from the meeting time, it still operates as usual from 7:00 PM every day. Yesterday was the Mid-Autumn Festival, and there were also spectacular fireworks starting at 10:30 PM.</p>
<p>Ye Gongchao Leaves Shanghai for Beijing</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Ye Gongchao, counselor of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, had previously come to Shanghai for a short stay. It is now known that he left Shanghai for Beijing yesterday morning. Ye was formerly a professor at Tsinghua and Peking Universities and is a well-known literary critic in the country. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, he served as China's representative in the UK for the Ministry of Propaganda, working hard for the country and being highly admired by the British. During the occupation of Shanghai, Ye was framed by traitors and arrested by the enemy's military police. He later secretly left Shanghai and went to Hong Kong and then to the UK. This is his first visit to Shanghai since the war.</p>
<h3>Heavy Losses for British Tram Company: Many Plans Difficult to Implement for the Time Being</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The congestion in this city's traffic and the lack of public vehicles are the main causes. The reporter recently learned from the British Tram Company that the company's trams were severely damaged during the enemy and puppet period, so the number of trams running is less than before the war. Routes 6 and [unclear] Road are difficult to restore because a part of the tracks has been dismantled. Other vehicles have not been replaced with rubber tires for eight years due to years of disrepair and the war, resulting in a large number of trolleybuses on Routes 18 and 20 being stopped in the station. Only a few trolleybuses on Route 17 are responding to the market, and the proposal to operate jointly with the French company has been shelved because the vehicles are difficult to match. It is heard that the company has pre-ordered rubber tires from England, which can arrive in three batches. The first batch can be transported this month. After assembly, the closed routes can be restored ahead of schedule. As for the connection between the north and south tracks of Xizang Road and Jing'an Temple Road, it needs to be carried out after the road is widened. It is feared that it will be difficult to achieve this year.</p>
<h3>New Traffic Measures: Difficulties Are Inevitable at the Beginning of Implementation: Public Works Bureau Emergency Meeting: More Traffic Police to Be Added</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The central area of ​​the city is too congested due to the excessive number of vehicles. Therefore, even after the implementation of traffic improvement measures, the vehicles are still extremely congested. Moreover, because the new measures were implemented at the beginning, many drivers were unable to understand them thoroughly, and there were many violations. According to the police bureau's statistics yesterday, the fines for vehicle violations in one day yesterday reached 3 million yuan, and the traffic police felt that it was difficult to direct traffic. The disorder on the road has not been completely improved. Therefore, Zhao Zengjue, director of the Public Works Bureau, convened an emergency meeting on traffic improvement in the municipal government conference room at 3:00 PM yesterday to discuss effective measures. It is heard that there will be no changes in principle to the measures that have already been implemented, such as one-way traffic lanes and parking lots, which will remain the same. However, more traffic police will be added to achieve practical results.</p>

<h3>Increasing Yarn Factory Production by Utilizing Nighttime Electricity</h3>

The payment notice needs to be filled out with the name of the institution, the name of the person receiving the goods, the name of the person in charge, the payment date, the amount, and other information.</p>
<h3>The High Court Continues to Hear the Case of Yan Chuntang and Summons Several Witnesses for Questioning; The Cases of the Lin Qin Brothers and Mei Jicheng are Concluded</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Yan Chuntang, the former manager of Yihua Film Company, was arrested after the outbreak of the Pacific War when enemy and puppet forces occupied the Shanghai concessions, because he had served as a supervisor in the puppet Chinese Film United Company. The High Procuratorate filed a public lawsuit against him on charges of treason, and the High Court has already held one hearing. At the second hearing yesterday afternoon, Yan stated: Yihua Company was founded in 1927 and was a shareholder-based company, not a sole proprietorship. It had produced many films over the past ten years. After the outbreak of the Pacific War, it was difficult to maintain due to a shortage of raw materials. In June of the following year, Zhang Shankun came and said that the Shanghai Film Company would be merged. He persuaded me to join, so I sold it to the puppet Chinese United Film Production Company for 200,000 yuan, but I only received 125,000 yuan in cash. Later, the company merged with "China Film Company" and "Shanghai Cinema Company" to reorganize into the puppet Chinese Film United Company, and hired me as a supervisor in name, but I resigned without taking the position. At the end of June of the thirty-second year (1943), I personally bought back the Yihua company that I had sold, he said. The court then questioned Yuan Yijiang, the director of the Shanghai Liaison Office of the former Military Intelligence Bureau's Shanghai Suburban Command Station, and Chen Boliang, the captain of the Workers' Commando Team's West Shanghai District, regarding the defendant's claim that he had sheltered underground workers and secret radio stations and was arrested and tortured by the enemy's military police. It also summoned Feng Jie, the general manager of the puppet Chinese Film United Company, and Huang Tianzu, the production minister, to inquire about the defendant's participation in "Huaying." The case was adjourned for further hearing, and the defendant was remanded in custody.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the cases of Wang Wei, a secret agent of the enemy's military police, and his mistress Fan Jingfang, who framed our underground workers, the White Russian intelligence agent Taitiesiji who sabotaged our anti-Japanese work, and the suspected traitors Zhang Genshou and Sun Xiaolin, were all investigated and adjourned for further hearing.</p>
<p>[Furthermore, it is reported] The three Lin brothers, Lin Qin, Lin Ji, and Lin Mai, were accused of organizing the Dingji Company during the enemy and puppet period, buying rice, cotton, and other supplies for the enemy and selling Japanese goods. The case was concluded by the High Court yesterday, and the verdict will be announced on the 17th of this month. The case of the puppet Baozhang (neighborhood chief) Mei Jicheng will also be announced on the 17th.</p>

<h3>Former Headquarters of the Fourth Provincial Border Region Holds Garden Party</h3>
<p>During the Anti-Japanese War, the central government designated the border region of Lu (Shandong), Su (Jiangsu), Wan (Anhui), and Yu (Henan) as a party-government reconstruction zone, and appointed General Tang Enbo as the commander-in-chief of the border region and the chairman of the border region party-government branch. Due to the integration of party, government, and military, the achievements were remarkable, making it the best of all the party-government branches in the country. After the victory, General Tang flew to Shanghai to preside over the surrender matters in Nanjing and Shanghai, and his former subordinates also came to serve in the Nanjing and Shanghai area. However, due to busy work, there have been no opportunities for cheerful gatherings in recent years.

<h3>Mo Guangcheng's Words About the Zhang Xinfu Case</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent Lingfeng from Shenyang Airmail on August 27th, This Newspaper</p>
<p>Bloodstains in the History of Takeovers</p>
<p>Zhang Xinfu's blood has stained the opening page of the history of the Northeast takeover.</p>
<p>It was in the early days of the Northeast restoration, in early January, when it was "icy and snowy" and "the wind was biting," a special train carrying the central government's industrial and mining takeover personnel to the Northeast, whistling as it headed towards Fushun, preparing to take over the Fushun coal mines.</p>
<p>At that time, Fushun and the railway line from Shenyang to Fushun were mostly controlled by the Communist army. Sitting on the special train were Mr. Zhang Xinfu, as well as other industrial and mining takeover personnel accompanying Mr. Zhang to Fushun. In addition, there were some railway police, who had previously obtained safety guarantees from the Soviet army.</p>
<p>This special train managed to reach Fushun, but because the situation was not right, Zhang and others requested that the special train return to Shenyang. When the train reached Lishizhai station halfway, a tragedy occurred. Zhang Xinfu and his eight companions were stabbed in the chest by the Communist army. Zhang had eighteen stab wounds on his body, and the other personnel suffered the same fate. The bodies of Zhang Xinfu and the other martyrs were left on the snow for several days, for the villagers nearby to view. The guarding Communist army told the villagers, "He is a major traitor, does he deserve to die?" Everyone had to say, "He deserves to die," before leaving. The residents of the Lishizhai area still often tell of the tragic scene at that time.</p>
<p>Eight months have passed, and Zhang Xinfu and others have died with resentment, their grievances unavenged, their coffins parked in the Guandi Temple in Shenyang. Today, the Communist army "Company Commander of the 7th Company, 3rd Battalion, 22nd Regiment, 8th Brigade of the Liaodong Military Region" Mo Guangcheng, who carried out the execution at that time, has finally been captured. After military trials in Jinzhou and Shenyang, Mo confessed frankly and without hesitation. However, he added that he was executing orders from the Communist army authorities, and that he did not personally commit the act.</p>
<p>The Murderer is Caught in the Net</p>
<p>Mo Guangcheng is detained in the Third Prison in Shenyang. With the permission of the commander's headquarters, the reporter took a car and traveled more than twenty miles. The wide street outside Dabeimen (Great North Gate), combined with two rows of large trees, was a very peaceful sight. A building painted with protective camouflage stood before us, which was our destination.</p>
<p>The reporter followed the guiding guards upstairs. Two rows of rooms with windows facing each other came into view. The guard shouted "Mo Guangcheng," and immediately a voice answered "Here" from the first room at the head of the stairs. Before the answer was finished, the figure of a young man appeared on the iron window bars, his hands holding the bars, his face pressed against the iron bars, looking at the reporters who were walking forward with a questioning look.</p>
<p>"We are news reporters here to visit you," the reporter explained his identity. He responded to the scene with a bitter smile and an expectant expression.</p>
<p>The structure of the prison cell was Japanese-style, with tatami mats on the wooden floor. Incomplete bedding was laid on the mats, and everyone walked, stood, and lay down on these Japanese-style "tatami." The doors and windows were connected to the edge of the tatami, and the light and air were still sufficient. The diet still followed the quantitative methods of the (Manchu) era. It is said that the prisons in Shenyang are considered the best, because the Japanese also imprisoned Japanese criminals here.</p>
<p>At this time, Mo Guangcheng had been taken out of the prison cell and followed everyone out of the building and onto the balcony. He sat on the short wall and began to talk. It is not known what caused him to be sad, but he burst into tears in front of me. He wiped away the tears with his black shirt and described his family situation, saying: "I am from Xiage Village, Tiechang Town, Zunhua County, Hebei Province. I am 24 years old this year. Because my parents favored me, I did not go to school. After the Lugou Bridge Incident, the Eighth Route Army arrived at my home. All four of my older brothers joined the Eighth Route Army. My eldest brother, second brother, and fourth brother died in battle one after another. My third brother's whereabouts are unknown."</p>
<p>The Tragic Details of the Martyrdom</p>
<p>The conversation about the circumstances of Zhang Xinfu's death began.</p>
<p>Someone asked: "Mr. Zhang Xinfu died so tragically. The Chinese mining industry lost a capable partner, and the country lost a talented person. The knife wounds on his body, and the eyes that did not close after death, still linger in everyone's minds. How could you bear to do it at the time?" Mo Guangcheng said: "I was acting under orders at the time, but I did not stab him myself. It was the platoon leader and the brothers who did it. I was watching from afar."</p>
<p>Then he described the scene at the time, saying: "The train that Zhang Xinfu was riding in was a first-class special train. When it was traveling from Shenyang to Fushun, the train passed Shenjingzi (at that time, the area from Shenjingzi Station was controlled by the Communist army). The local garrison, the First Company of the First Battalion, used a red flag to advise the train to stop, but the train refused to stop (according to what the Soviet army in Shenyang advised Zhang, saying: the journey is not peaceful, do not stop under any circumstances), so they opened fire. When I was stationed in Lishizhai, I received a call from the First Company, saying that the train had left Shenjingzi and that I should immediately detain the train. But before the phone call ended, the train had already passed the place where I was stationed. Later, the brigade headquarters issued an order saying: 'When the train returns to Panyang (Shenyang), it must be detained, and everyone on the train must be arrested. Violators will be dealt with according to military law.' And the brigade commanders were driving around to various stations all day long to supervise the various units. I also didn't sleep for several days because of this. Later, I heard that the train would not be coming back, so everyone relaxed a little.</p>
<p>One day, I forgot the date, around nine o'clock in the afternoon, Liu Ziyi, the deputy commander of the Security Brigade, arrived at Lishizhai Station. At that time, I had gone to the battalion headquarters for important business. Deputy Commander Liu told Chen Guidong, the platoon leader stationed at the station: 'The train taking over the Fushun coal mine is about to return. On the train are also Guo (full name unknown), the political commissar of the Eighth Route Army, a Soviet major (name unknown), (it is said that he was also killed because of this incident), and several Soviet soldiers. Deputy Commander Liu ordered Platoon Leader Chen to arrest Zhang Xinfu and his personnel.</p>
<p>When I returned from the battalion headquarters, Zhang Xinfu and his eight subordinates were already tied up at the station, their overcoats had been taken off, and they were only wearing casual clothes. At that time, the Soviet army had already slipped away on the train, completely abandoning the responsibility of protecting Zhang Xinfu and others.</p>
<p>Later, Deputy Commander Liu ordered me to tie Zhang Xinfu to a south slope in the wilderness about two li (Chinese miles) from the station. Political Commissar Guo gave me the same order, and also said that Zhang Xinfu was a major traitor, and if the Fushun coal mine was taken over by the Kuomintang, the Eighth Route Army would have no way to survive. Because they were not my direct superiors, and at the same time, I didn't know if this order was really correct, so if I was investigated later, I wouldn't be able to take responsibility, so I refused to carry it out. Deputy Commander Liu sent a guard to force me to kill Zhang Xinfu. Under duress, I had to tie Zhang Xinfu and others to the south slope and ordered my soldiers to kill them with bayonets. Zhang Xinfu remained silent before his death, as if nothing had happened, but his attitude was extremely strong. His subordinates were like some poor worms, begging not to be killed!"</p>
<p>Confession in the Light of the Setting Sun</p>
<p>After this incident happened, I went to the battalion headquarters to report, but the battalion headquarters didn't say anything. The next day, Deputy Commander Liu specifically called me to Fushun to comfort me. Then the Soviet army found me for questioning, detained me for more than forty days, and then released me.</p>
<p>I found the ranks and moved from south to north, and soon moved from north to south again. I felt tired in my heart, because I felt that in the past, I was fighting against the Japanese, but now, it was my own people fighting. I didn't want to fight anymore. At the same time, I also missed my home. I wanted to go home. Some people felt the same as me, so we deserted at the same time, a total of about twenty people. Because the escape was not legal, most of the people I was with were scattered by the Eighth Route Army on the way.</p>
<p>I ran to Xifeng and planned to serve the country under the name of Li Deyi, but because I wanted to go home, I left again. On the way, I inquired about the situation in my hometown from the villagers. The result was that I couldn't go back, because my home was still under the rule of the Eighth Route Army. If I ran back illegally like this, the result would not be good.</p>
<p>Unable to make up my mind, I ran to Huludao and stayed at the home of Zhao Peiyun, the sergeant clerk of my company. In order to maintain my livelihood, I sold my watch and got 50,000 yuan in legal currency. I used this money to run a small cigarette business. After doing it for more than ten days, I was arrested by the garrison. My eight years of life in the Eighth Route Army came to an end.</p>
<p>Someone asked him: "Were you in Huludao to do work?" His eyes turned red again, and he said with tears in his eyes: "What would the Communist army send someone illiterate like me to do?" The person refuting him said: "Haven't you received the Communist army's education?" He said: "The education I received was very limited. I can say that everything I have said is true, without any falsehood. I can swear that if I tell lies, I will be struck by lightning when I die."</p>
<p>The setting sun was in the sky, and he ended his conversation with the reporters, saying with emotion: "I was wrong. Kill me or keep me, I hope for a quick end." At the same time, he also repeatedly asked the reporters to "say good things" to the commander, meaning to say some good words for him. The indication from the military law office is that they will collect evidence and then make a decision.</p>
<p>On the way back, two tragic scenes were entangled in my mind: one was Zhang Xinfu, who was covered in knife wounds and had not yet closed his eyes in death, and the other was Mo Guangcheng, the murderer who carried out the cruel orders at that time!</p>

<p>Dear Editor: I am a high school student at a provincial high school. My father is a salaried civil servant, and I have two siblings, all of whom are in school. Our family has little savings beyond basic expenses. My siblings are studying at private middle schools, where tuition is expensive, so they applied for city education loans. Because I am in a provincial middle school, where tuition is lower, I did not apply for a loan. Who knew that today I would receive a bill for nearly 190,000 (first installment of food expenses is 80,000, teacher appreciation fund is 50,000, utilities are 25,000, loss reserve is 10,000, etc.), and two blankets are 20,000. Even though it is called a provincial middle school, the miscellaneous fees are so high, how can the children of salaried civil servants afford to attend? (Cheng Ming)</p>
<p>Unfair Treatment of Postal Workers Transferred</p>
<p>Many postal workers or customs officers are transferred from the Shanghai Post Office or Customs to other locations. If the employee has a large family, moving expenses are astronomical due to current transportation difficulties, which is truly a matter of driving people to their death! Because it is universally known that public servants are poor, it is difficult to bring families along. They can only go alone or with part of their family. Taking someone who earns a base salary of 200 yuan as an example, if they work in Shanghai, they can receive a total salary of 294,000 yuan (base salary of 200 yuan multiplied by the cost of living index of 720, plus a basic amount of 150,000 yuan), which is already barely enough to support their family. Once transferred to another location, taking Gansu and Yunnan as examples, they can only receive a salary of 132,000 yuan (less than half of Shanghai) (multiplied by the cost of living index of 260, plus a basic amount of 60,000 yuan). It is impossible to cover expenses in both locations with this amount, and they are bound to starve, which defeats the purpose of encouraging service in remote areas. Moreover, remittance rates are extremely high now, and the remittance time is extremely slow. Therefore, I urge the authorities to restore the pre-war postal and customs practices for these employees, namely, "if there is a need to cover expenses in two locations, they can receive salaries and allowances based on the higher cost of living location," as a demonstration of the government's compassion for civil servants serving in remote areas. If the postal and customs bureaus can restore the pre-war uniform salary system across all locations, it is indeed what everyone expects. (Hu Guang)</p>
<p>Fraudulent Swindlers - Frequent Roadside Scams</p>
<p>When my father goes out to work, a person in short sleeves and pants suddenly comes, carrying a briefcase and a stack of notebooks, looking like a high-class merchant. He tries to sell my mother something called "Rent Receipt" booklets (see attached), costing 1,000 yuan each. He claims to be dispatched by a certain committee's lawyer's office and forcefully tries to sell ten booklets. My mother refuses, but he coerces her with various words, saying that with this booklet, housing disputes can be resolved. My mother believes him and pays him 10,000 yuan, but he only gives her nine booklets. It was not until I came home that I discovered they were useless scraps of paper. My mother was heartbroken when she found out (because my father's monthly income is only about 200,000). When we went to chase after him, he had vanished without a trace. On the back of the booklet, it is printed that the author is lawyer Yao Yuntuan and the publisher is the Dazhong Publishing House. This is a fraudulent matter, so I especially request your newspaper to expose it and ask the relevant security authorities and all sectors to pay attention to prevent similar situations from happening again.

<p>Screams from the Edge of Hell</p>
<p>Since Qidong was invaded by the Communist army, it has brought many new tricks: (1) Each person is allocated 500 steps of land. Extra land must be given to them for distribution, for which you get a red flag, which is considered glorious. I got a green flag and a white flag, which is shameful. (2) The total amount of public grain collected in the autumn is 60,000... Qidong's entire population is only 300,000... Calculate how much each person has to bear? (3) Widows are encouraged to remarry and women to give birth to children. The so-called social morality has been completely "liberated." (4) The families of government officials must be killed, and refugees who have fled must also be killed. Why? Because they did not cooperate with them. (5) Beggars in the "liberated areas" must first register with the district government to obtain a registration certificate before they can beg from door to door. In the past two days, the number of refugees continuing to flee from Qidong to Chongming has exceeded 5,000. There is no other hope, only the hope of being able to step back into free homeland as soon as possible!</p>
<p>The Tide of Bankruptcies in Nantong</p>
<p>Dear Editor: Since July, dozens of shops and businesses in Nantong have gone bankrupt and closed, causing a great disturbance throughout the city and disrupting the order of the business community. It started with a man from Anhui named Hong, who opened Tianchengde Tobacco Shop on East Street in the city. It had been in business for many years and was quite prosperous. However, recently, he began to absorb and dismantle bills on a large scale, and on July 3, he suddenly declared bankruptcy. A lawyer was appointed to liquidate the assets. The liquidation resulted in debts of 175 million yuan, but only the remaining 40 million yuan worth of goods were distributed proportionally, only 25%. Most of the creditors were refugees, who were helpless and could only complain in vain, which ended without resolution. After Tianchengde's liquidation concluded, unscrupulous merchants who had been collecting and dismantling bills with malicious intent saw this situation and considered it a good plan. They all felt that the opportunity was rare, so they went bankrupt one after another. Although the authorities paid close attention, it was never heard that anyone had been severely punished or legally sanctioned, and they were all able to escape the law and enjoy their ill-gotten gains. Therefore, the trend has become more rampant and has not stopped. This is a social problem. If strict measures are not taken, who knows what will happen in the future? I hope the economic and financial authorities will pay attention to it! (Hong Qiankun)</p>

<h3>Flames of War in the Northeast</h3>
<p>Illustrated Explanation</p>
<p>1. Yingkou: At the end of October last year, China and the Soviet Union began discussing the handover of the Northeast to the National Army in accordance with the agreement, which was scheduled to land in Yingkou. On November 4, General Du Yuming came here once to deploy, but due to Soviet interference and Communist troops' covert encroachment, the National Army's landing was obstructed. Later, the Communist troops built fortifications along the coast, making it the main port for reinforcements from within the pass to the Northeast.</p>
<p>2. Western Liaoning Corridor: On November 17 last year, after the Battle of Shanhaiguan, the Northeast Security Team of the National Army under General Du Yuming entered the Northeast and advanced rapidly along the Beining Railway. On November 25, it stationed in Jinzhou and divided into three routes: the left wing entered Rehe on December 29; the right wing entered Yingkou once on January 9; the main force reached the suburbs of Shenyang on January 15 this year, stationed in Huanggu Village and Beidaying.</p>
<p>3. Airlift to Changchun: At the end of November last year, during the Changchun talks, the government and the Soviet Union discussed the technical issues of the National Army's airlift to the Northeast and reached an agreement. However, after a setback, China and the Soviet Union continued to discuss military liaison matters in mid-December. On January 5 this year, the first batch of National Army began to land in Changchun to take over defenses, and part of them stationed in Sipingjie on the 12th.</p>
<p>4. Shenyang Takeover: From March 7, the Soviet army in Shenyang suddenly began to move north without any prior notice. Their actions were confusing and the situation was extremely chaotic. The Communist troops took the opportunity to seize Dongdaying and Beiling and invaded the city. On the 11th, the National Army entered the city to take over defenses. There was a fierce battle on the south bank of the Hun River in the southern suburbs. Order gradually returned on the 13th.</p>
<p>5. Chaotic Situation in Northern Liaoning: From March 9 to 14, the Soviet army in Northern Liaoning was continuously transferred north, and the situation in various places was extremely chaotic. The Communist troops successively captured Lishu, Kaiyuan, Changtu, and Tieling. On the 17th, they entered Sipingjie, and the traffic south of Changchun on the Middle East Railway was completely cut off. The National Army's New First Army advanced slowly north along the railway from Shenyang on the 17th to take over sovereignty.</p>
<p>6. Battle of Changchun: From March 19, the Soviet army in Changchun began to withdraw, and the situation was uneasy. On April 2, the Communist troops gathered outside and began to attack the suburbs. The National Army in the city was surrounded and cut off from outside aid. After half a month of hard fighting by the isolated army, a mixed battle broke out in the urban area on the 16th, and it was finally lost on the 18th.</p>
<p>7. Battle of Sipingjie: On April 17, the New First Army advanced to the front line of Sipingjie, and the main forces of the two armies came into contact and launched a major battle. The total strength of the two sides reached 150,000. The main force of the Communist army was distributed along the Sipingjie-Gongzhuling line, trying to resist stubbornly to prevent the National Army from advancing north. The National Army confronted and fought head-on in the urban area while simultaneously advancing a part of its forces to the mountainous area of Gongzhuling, flanking the back of Sipingjie, and expanding its wings to attack Liaoyuan and Hailong, making a large pincer movement. On May 17, the right wing suffered a major battle in Xifeng. The Communist army collapsed completely and its momentum was shaken. The main force of the National Army on the front continued to intensify its pressure and entered Sipingjie on the 19th. This major battle, after 32 days of fierce fighting, finally came to an end.</p>
<p>8. Battle of Benxi Lake: In mid-March, the New Sixth Army advanced south from Shenyang along the Middle East Railway and the Anshen Railway in two routes. At the beginning of April, they reached Haicheng and Benxi respectively. At the beginning of May, the Communist army looked north along the Anshen Railway, attempting to attack Shenyang to support the stalemated battle of Sipingjie. In the Battle of Benxi Lake on May 2, 100,000 of the main Communist forces were routed and retreated to the Changbai Mountain area, unable to recover.</p>
<p>9. Northern Sweep: After the Battle of Sipingjie, the combat sequence of the Communist army in the Northeast was scattered, and they retreated to the Xing'anling Mountains, deploying along the north bank of the Songhua River and the Changha Railway. The main force was concentrated in the Qiqihar Fortress, and there was no major battle south of the Songhua River. The National Army advanced north from Sipingjie in full force, conducting a sweep in five routes. The left wing successively reached the Liaoyuan, Shuangshan, and Nongan lines. The main force entered Changchun on May 23, and the two routes continued to advance rapidly towards Harbin and Jilin. The eastern route entered Yongji on the 28th, stationed in Lafa on June 4, and the two routes of the right wing joined forces in Yedian on the 5th. The New First Army reached the Songhua River on May 30 after taking Yaomen. The Communist army blew up the bridge on the Middle East Railway to prevent the National Army from advancing. On June 6, the National Army crossed the natural barrier of the Songhua River estuary, 75 miles south of Harbin, and established a bridgehead in Taolai Zhao. On the 7th, the Northeast Armistice Order reached all lines of the National Army, and all complied with the order to stop advancing.</p>
<p>10. Battle of the Liaodong Peninsula: While the National Army was sweeping the north with the force of an autumn wind sweeping away fallen leaves, the Communist army in Liaodong, in order to contain them, landed in Zhuanghe with reinforcements from Shandong and gathered in the Xiu'an area. From May 24, they launched three surprise attacks on the Middle East Railway, occupying Anshan, Weihai City, and Dashiqiao. After the National Army counterattacked and crushed them, the Communist troops fled to the mountainous area on the border between China and Korea east of Qianshan. The battle ended on June 6.</p>
<p>11. Battle of Lafa: On June 7, the Communist army violated the armistice order and attacked the National Army's positions in Lafa on all fronts in the Northeast. Lin Biao attacked the National Army's positions in Lafa with all his forces, flanking Laoye Ridge and invading Lafa's old and new stations on the 12th. The National Army withdrew to the Daxiao Gujiazi line. By the 14th, the Communist army had withdrawn from Lafa, and the National Army had not stationed there.</p>
<p>12. Miaochun Islands: On June 17, the National Army fleet patrolled the waters of Changshan Islands to monitor the Communist army's route of stealing to the Northeast through the Bohai Strait. By the 22nd, the ships had returned to their defenses one after another.</p>
<p>13. Dalian and Lushun: According to the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance: Dalian is a free port for 30 years; Lushun is a joint naval base for 30 years. On May 22, Marshal Malinovsky, commander-in-chief of the Soviet army in the Northeast, announced that the Soviet army in the Northeast had completed its withdrawal on May 3. In fact, this area is still under its military occupation.</p>
<p>14. Current Contact Area: Since the Northeast Armistice Order was issued, except for the Battle of Lafa, the Northeast front has been generally quiet and uneventful, with only occasional sporadic contacts. Currently, the Communist army is on the move again, sending reinforcements to Taolai Zhao on the Songhua River front and shelling the National Army's bridgehead positions. At the same time, Tieling is surrounded on three sides; Faku is also under attack, but after the National Army rushed to the rescue and suppressed the bandits, the situation remains very stable.

<h3>Replies to Readers - Medical and Health</h3>
<p>(1) Bone Tuberculosis Ulceration</p>
<p>Cai Xin asks: "In the summer of the 30th year [of the Republic], my wife's left knee ulcerated. She underwent surgery to scrape the bone, but due to economic pressure, she could not complete the procedure and stopped halfway, only buying medicine for self-treatment. For the past five years, the wound, about the size of a silver dollar, has not closed. Please advise on a proper treatment method."</p>
<p>Yin Huizhu asks: (1) "My child is only four years old and suddenly developed swelling in his right knee three months ago. After more than two months of treatment by a Chinese medicine doctor, applying plasters and poultices, it was ineffective. Although he can move now, he feels slight pain when pressed hard. What is this disease?"</p>
<p>(2) "After diagnosis and X-ray examination at a public hospital, because the hospital does not have a doctor specializing in orthopedics, it was equivalent to not seeing a doctor. They only said that the child's knee bones may have T.B. However, the child is only three years and three months old, and currently weighs 15 kilograms, and his development is quite healthy. What are the symptoms of bone tuberculosis? Is it possible for my child to have bone tuberculosis?"</p>
<p>(3) "Please introduce an orthopedic expert with affordable consultation fees and provide instructions on treatment methods."</p>
<p>[Reply from Dr. Gu Yuqi, Doctor of Medicine] Based on the information in your letter, it is likely bone tuberculosis. Diagnosis can be made after X-ray examination. Then, treatment can involve sunlamp therapy followed by applying skin-regenerating medicine, and using a plaster cast to fix the leg. At the same time, take multiple vitamin supplements and inject glucose calcium, vitamin C, etc. Children can also suffer from bone tuberculosis, and the treatment method is the same.</p>
<p>Testicular Tuberculosis</p>
<p>Wang Jun asks: "I recently suffered from swelling in my left testicle, making it difficult to move. After being introduced by your organization to Renji Hospital for treatment, it improved slightly, and it is now easier to move. However, one wave subsides, and another rises. Half a month ago, I suffered from a cough and found blood in my sputum. After X-ray examination, I learned that it was a lung disease and that I needed to be hospitalized for injections, which is very expensive. Please have your doctor advise on treatment methods."</p>
<p>[Reply from Dr. Gu Yuqi, Doctor of Medicine] Based on the information in your letter, it is likely pulmonary tuberculosis and testicular tuberculosis. Because there are already cavities, you are coughing up blood. Artificial pneumothorax is needed, and surgery is needed for testicular tuberculosis.</p>
<p>(3) Blood in Sputum</p>
<p>Chen Xingbao asks: "My younger sister is twelve years old this year and has always been quite strong. Since the beginning of last winter, she suddenly discovered blood in her sputum, but it healed quickly. Who knew it would recur recently, and the amount of blood is more than last year. It comes and goes. I don't know what disease it is. Please answer the following three questions on behalf of your newspaper."</p>
<p>(1) Is this condition dangerous? What is it called?</p>
<p>(2) How should this condition be treated to be effective?</p>
<p>(3) If this condition is left untreated, will it cause adverse consequences?</p>
<p>[Reply from Dr. Gu Yuqi, Doctor of Medicine] It is likely the initial stage of pulmonary tuberculosis. An X-ray examination is needed immediately. If it is necessary to perform artificial pneumothorax, it is hoped that it will be performed immediately.</p>

<p>Letter Received Dear Editor: The information about our school in the letter from Mr. Shao Bingjin published in the Social Services column of your newspaper on September 1 is clearly inaccurate. The funds for our school each semester, in addition to being covered by the tuition paid by students, are far from sufficient. They have always been covered by the members of the entire guild dividing up the expenses on average. The tuition fees collected this semester were previously discussed by the school board and deposited in various guilds for withdrawal at any time. During the deposit period, the interest given was slightly higher to provide assistance, but it was not as much as one dime per month. As for the use of the interest, it is entirely used for (1) the library fund, (2) subsidies for faculty and staff, and (3) repairing school buildings and purchasing equipment. However, the interest is very small because the deposits must be withdrawn at any time, and the interest decreases with the principal. All of our school's expenses, in addition to being covered by all the tuition fees, still require the entire guild to shoulder the insufficient amount. We hereby provide a letter to explain and hope that you will publish it to dispel misunderstandings. To Shen Bao, Board of Directors of Shanghai Private Money Industry Primary and Secondary School</p>

<h3>Philippine Overseas Chinese Schools Severely Lack Teachers</h3>
<p>[Nanjing News] There are currently four Chinese middle schools and seventy-nine primary schools in the Philippines, and education is very developed. However, there is a severe shortage of teachers. Those who are hired from the country are often subject to import restrictions, so the local overseas Chinese have repeatedly telegraphed the central authorities to establish overseas Chinese normal schools in the Philippines to cultivate teachers for overseas Chinese education. Regarding this point, the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission and the Ministry of Education are both considering it. It is also heard that there is a possibility of establishing normal schools in various overseas locations where overseas Chinese are concentrated.</p>

<p>Household Registration Laws and Regulations  Questions and Answers (Continued)  (74) Question:  If someone moves from County A to County B, and has not obtained household registration or temporary household registration in County B, and has not lived there for a month, what kind of registration should be made?  Answer: If the entire household moves out of the county and meets the requirements of Articles 44 and 103 of the Household Registration Law, a transfer registration should be made. Otherwise, a registration of migrated population should be made.</p>
<p>(75) Question: What kind of registration should be made if someone moves in and has not lived there for a month?  Answer: According to the first paragraph of Article 3 of the Provisional Household Registration Regulations, a registration of transient population should be made, or according to the first paragraph of Article 5 of the Migrated Population Registration Regulations, a registration of migrated population should be made.</p>
<p>(76) Question: What kind of registration book should be used for migration within ten days or within the same township?  Answer: The local authorities can develop their own forms.</p>
<p>(77) Question: How should the meaning of "within ten days or within the same township" in the second paragraph of Article 5 of the Migrated Population Registration Regulations be interpreted?  Answer: The former refers to the transient population mentioned in Article 3 of the Provisional Household Registration Regulations, while the latter has no time limit.</p>
<p>(78) Question: How should the migration certificate be used?  Answer: The purpose of the migration certificate is to prove the identity of the migrant for the purpose of inspection, which is equivalent to a temporary identity card. If only one certificate is issued to the head of the household, it can reduce the filling procedures in the township office, but it will be inconvenient for the migrant to move. Therefore, a migration certificate should still be issued separately to each family member who moves together to comply with the regulations. However, to reduce unnecessary procedures, minors can be noted in the migration certificate of their parents, and a separate migration certificate will not be issued.</p>
<p>(79) Question: Is the phrase "migration within ten days" in the second paragraph of Article 5 of the Migrated Population Registration Regulations the same as "transient population who have another residence or domicile elsewhere and come and go frequently" in Article 3 of the Provisional Household Registration Regulations?  Answer: Provisional household registration and migrant population registration are different in nature. The former refers to household registration, while the latter refers to population. The deadline for registration should be specified separately and is not duplicated.</p>
<p>(80) Question: How should migration between Bao and Jia be handled?  Answer: The Household Registration Law stipulates that a registration of application for address change should be made.</p>

<p>Shanghai Municipal Business Tax  To Be Transferred to the Finance Bureau on the 15th  Chamber of Commerce Eagerly Hopes for Improved Collection Procedures  Profits Tax Also Underway  [Our Newspaper] It has been agreed upon by the Municipal Finance Bureau and the Direct Tax Bureau that the Shanghai Municipal Business Tax will be taken over by the Municipal Finance Bureau on October 15th. The autumn business tax due from July 1st will be collected by the Finance Bureau. Matters not yet handled by the Direct Tax Bureau regarding the summer business tax will also be continued by the Finance Bureau. It is also heard that some of the personnel who previously handled business tax in the Direct Tax Bureau will also be transferred to the Finance Bureau for their expertise. The Municipal Chamber of Commerce hopes that after the Finance Bureau takes over, the collection procedures can be further improved for the convenience of merchants and residents.</p>
<p>Last Year's Profits Tax  Falls Short of Government Expectations  Since Director Lou of the Direct Tax Administration came to Shanghai to supervise and urge the collection of the profits tax for the 34th year of the Republic, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and the Shanghai Direct Tax Bureau have been actively expediting the process. In total, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce has 277 trade associations and 23 merchant members, totaling 300 units. As of September 5th, 237 units have submitted their declarations to the Chamber of Commerce. Some of these have reportedly submitted directly to the Direct Tax Bureau. According to sources in the Tax Committee of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the tax revenue based on the declared figures is very limited. This is because before August of the 34th year, Shanghai was still under enemy-puppet rule. Commodities such as rice, flour, yarn, cloth, coal, iron, and hardware were strictly controlled, and electricity was also strictly rationed, making it impossible to produce. With little business, net profits were naturally low. Since the victory, raw materials, fuel, and transportation have all been in the initial stages of recovery and have not been abundant and smooth. Furthermore, the exchange rate of 200 to 1 for puppet currency has greatly reduced the original book profits of various industries. The Tax Committee of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce is deeply concerned because the Direct Tax Bureau has high expectations for the profits tax budget for the 34th year, but the actual business of various industries in that year was so sluggish. They are now working day and night to calculate the turnover and profit of the declared units in order to create statistics for relevant parties to refer to within this week. It is also heard that the Direct Tax Administration of the Ministry of Finance attaches great importance to the profits tax for the 34th year in Shanghai. Director Wang will reportedly come to Shanghai in person soon to discuss collection methods with responsible persons in the industrial and commercial sectors. The Tax Committee of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce plans to issue certificates to the units that have submitted their survey forms for identification. Those who have not submitted are still expected to do so quickly.</p>
<p>Special Excessive Profits Tax  To Be Collected Starting This Month  The Shanghai Direct Tax Bureau has stipulated the scope and tax rates for the collection of special excessive profits tax in Shanghai, which will begin in September. The collection scope includes: (1) the financial industry (including banks, money shops, silver firms, silver companies, enterprise companies, insurance companies, trust companies, etc.); (2) the trading industry (including those who transport and sell industrial products and agricultural products); (3) the manufacturing industry (including those who manufacture and modify industrial products); (4) middlemen such as agents, brokers, etc.; and (5) the construction industry (such as construction plants and construction companies). The tax rates for profits beyond the total operating capital are as follows: (1) for profits not exceeding 500%, approximately one-seventh of the surplus will be collected; (2) for profits exceeding 500%, 60% will be collected. Taxpayers include state-owned and private enterprises. However, educational, cultural, public welfare, and charitable organizations that use their profits for those purposes are exempt from collection.</p>
<p>Overdrafts Must Be Secured  Money Industry Complies with Orders  Money shops and banks in Shanghai have always required guarantees for overdrafts by depositors. This has now been implemented starting this month, with contracts signed in accordance with regulations. It is learned that all overdrafts from the past have been recovered by the Mid-Autumn Festival. If continued overdrafts are required, new contracts must be signed and proper guarantees must be provided.</p>
<p>Woolen Textile Industry  Requests Delay in Collection of Commodity Tax  Various coarse and fine woolens manufactured by woolen textile factories in our country have long held a position in the domestic goods sector. During the war of resistance, few factories were able to operate due to raw material and power issues. The weak foundation almost collapsed completely. After the victory, factories were waiting to recover, but first, labor strikes occurred one after another, wages increased, costs soared, and sales stagnated. Then, imported goods arrived in large quantities, with low prices and high quality, making it difficult to compete. As a result, all factories were overwhelmed and felt unable to maintain operations, with no way to close down. Since the promulgation of the Commodity Tax Regulations, wool and woolen products have been subject to a 15% tax. The breadth of the scope and the height of the tax rate are absolutely unbearable for the factories. It is learned that the Municipal Chamber of Commerce has been requested to forward a letter to the relevant authorities to request a temporary delay in collection, and a temporary general meeting of members will be convened on the 14th of this month to discuss coping strategies in order to maintain the industry.</p>
<p>Eight Types of Public Bonds to Be Drawn  Five Pre-War and Three Wartime  Except for Guangdong Bonds, Payments Will Be Made According to Regulations  The drawing of principal for eight types of public bonds, including the Class B Unified Public Bonds of the 25th year of the Republic, the Long-Term Financial Public Bonds of the 17th year of the Republic, the Guangdong Financial Consolidation Public Bonds of the 25th year of the Republic, the Sichuan Post-War Reconstruction Public Bonds of the 25th year of the Republic, the Guangdong-Hong Kong River Project US Dollar Public Bonds of the 26th year of the Republic, the First Issue of Construction Public Bonds of the 28th year of the Republic, and the Third Issue of Military Needs Public Bonds of the 28th year of the Republic, was held at 9:00 AM on the 9th at the Shanghai Office of the Public Debt Department of the Ministry of Finance. Representatives from the Audit Department, the Silver and Money Industry Association, and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce were sent to supervise. A total of 105 bonds were drawn, with a face value of 17,525,000 yuan in national currency and 60,000 US dollars. It is learned that the principal and due interest on the drawn bonds will be paid by the four banks of China, Central, Communications, and Farmers and the Central Trust Bureau in accordance with the original repayment dates stipulated in the bond regulations, except for the Guangdong-Hong Kong River Project US Dollar Public Bonds of the 26th year of the Republic, because the surtax of the Guangdong Customs, which was designated as the repayment fund for this item, was seized by the enemy and could not be remitted as planned. The principal and interest will be temporarily suspended and the resumption date will be set separately after the fund is cleared.</p>
<p>Stock Exchange Urges Payment of Bond Margin  The Shanghai Stock Exchange has announced that the bond market is ready and that brokers who have applied to enter the bond market but have not yet paid their margin, or who have not applied but wish to apply, should complete the procedures immediately. The cash portion of the margin, which is 20 million yuan in national currency, must be paid to the Finance Department of the Exchange by 12:00 noon on the 11th of this month. Late payments will have to wait six months after the market opens before they can be processed.</p>
<p>Northern Traders Buying on the Black Market Yesterday  Public bonds fluctuated yesterday. A large household on the seventh floor sold a lot, but the market was supported by purchases from northern traders on the fifth floor.

In the end, Jia and Yi rose 50 yuan, Bing fell 50 yuan, Ding rose 100 yuan, and Tong Wu also rose 50 yuan.</p>
<p>Gold Prices Not Easily Changed Under Strict Control  Gold and banknotes fell slightly yesterday.  Spot gold rose slightly for several days in a row, but retreated slightly yesterday. The Central Bank's control was slightly stricter, and the market was very tired in the middle of the day. The market opened at 2.15 million in the morning, and the Central Bank applied pressure, causing the price to gradually fall from 2.155 million. The Central Bank allocated 177 bars at a price of 2.14 million. After 10:00 AM, the situation deteriorated, and the price fell to a low of 2.117 million before stabilizing. The price recovered slightly to 2.13 million at noon, and remained slightly stable in the afternoon. In the end, the closing price fell 11,000 yuan from the previous day. Jewelry gold was 2.27 million, and silver bullion and silver dollars were flat. Due to the Mid-Autumn Festival, the money market was slightly tighter, and interest rates ranged from 1.5 to 1.8 Jiao.</p>
<p>Foreign currencies also weakened. The US dollar started at 3450 yuan in the morning and was immediately surrounded by sellers. The price fell to a low of 3380 yuan before being maintained. The price fluctuated around 3400 yuan at noon and continued to rise slightly in the afternoon.

<p>Vegetable Prices Soar During Mid-Autumn Festival  Yesterday was the Mid-Autumn Festival, and the prices of all goods soared, especially vegetable prices. Among the meat products, short ribs sold for 2500 yuan per catty, long ribs for 2200 yuan, and leg meat for 3300 to 3400 yuan.

<p>Mid-Autumn Festival Passes Peacefully  Silver and Money Industry Breaks Tradition and Does Not Take Holiday  The Mid-Autumn Festival passed peacefully yesterday. The silver and money industry exchanged 52,112 bills on the day, with a total exchange amount of only 125,405,822,000 yuan, a decrease of about 50 million yuan compared to the usual highest amount. This is because the financial payments were cleared before the Mid-Autumn Festival, and the transfer procedures were also completed. The market transaction was light as usual. Old-fashioned shops found it difficult to break traditional habits for a while. According to industry insiders, the money market is not very tight today. According to market practice, every time the silver and money industry takes a holiday, the payments and receipts will inevitably increase the next day, and the money market will inevitably tighten accordingly. This time, the silver and money industry operated as usual, maintaining normalcy, and the market had no major impact today. It is understood that the silver and money industry did not take a holiday this time, which saved some manpower and material resources. However, it also created a historical precedent.</p>
<p>Tea Completely Bought Up  Result of Exchange Rate Adjustment  [Tunxi News] Most of the crude tea from She, Xiu, and Wuyuan counties this year has been successively purchased by tea merchants. However, due to the cautious attitude of silk and tea merchants towards this year's tea market and their relationship with funds, there is still a small amount of crude tea that has not been purchased and remains in the hands of tea farmers. Recently, the news of the tea market has improved slightly due to the exchange rate adjustment, so they have entered the villages to purchase. The crude tea remaining in various places has been completely transferred from farmers to merchants, creating a phenomenon of sweeping the market. The crude tea stored in Wuyuan was also sold out within three days.</p>
<p>Stock Exchange Test Auction  Over-the-Counter Trading of Chinese Stocks Greatly Reduced  Result: Big Stocks Fall, Small Stocks Rise  Due to the stock exchange test auction yesterday, many Chinese stock firms suspended over-the-counter trading, and trading was even less frequent. Popular big stocks were still difficult to see demand, while small popular and unpopular stocks all made progress. The stock price differences continued to narrow. Initially, popular big stocks stood at high prices, while small stocks were still flat. Later, they gradually diverged, with big stocks falling and small stocks competing to rise. In the end, compared to the previous closing, Yongsheng yarn fell slightly, Meiya was flat, and Jingfu, Xinguang, and Qinxing all rose by a strong half. Most of the unpopular stocks made slight progress, while the original stocks were stable.</p>
<p>Foreign stocks continued to rise due to the increasing rumors of the listing of Qianye and Yipi. The rest were difficult to support and all retreated. In the end, with sparse trading, Yipi and Paper continued to rise slightly, while Yisheng, Wheelock, Yee Hong, and Asia all fell slightly. Steel and British Union continued to fall by a strong half.</p>
<p>Stock Exchange Notice  Payment Method for Listed Securities  Advertising Method for Brokers  [Our Newspaper] It is learned that the Stock Exchange authorities have recently sent a letter to the issuing companies of all listed securities, requesting them to pay the listing fees for the securities immediately. According to the Stock Exchange's provisional measures, each share will be charged a listing fee of 1 Jiao. If future orders from the Ministry change these provisional measures, the fees will be increased or refunded accordingly.</p>
<p>The Stock Exchange authorities have also recently instructed all individual brokers that when publishing advertisements in various newspapers, they must indicate the broker's Stock Exchange number and the broker's name, and must not appear solely in the name of the securities company, in order to prevent abuses. Legal person brokers are not subject to this restriction.</p>
<p>Out-of-Town Applications for Sugar  Taiwan Sugar Company Allocates Discretionally  The Allocated Price Will Be Determined by Today's Review Committee  [Our Newspaper] According to a person in charge of the Taiwan Sugar Company, the number of applications from out-of-town users during the twelfth allocation period exceeded 110,000 bags, which did not match the actual consumption. Therefore, they were not allocated as requested. Now, the Social Bureau, in order to sympathize with the difficulties of merchants, has forwarded the application documents of various out-of-town users to the Taiwan Sugar Company. It has been decided that when processing the thirteenth allocation of sugar on the twelfth and thirteenth of this month, the applications from these out-of-town users will also be allocated discretionally. As for the allocation price, it will be allocated according to the price methods set by today's Sugar Price Review Committee.</p>
<p>Autumn Cocoon Payment Method Determined  Cocoon Shops in Various Places Can Open Around the 20th  The payment method for autumn cocoons in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces has been discussed separately by the Central Bank, the Farmers Bank of China, the China Silk Company, and the Third District Silk Reeling Industry Association. The main points of the determined method are as follows: (1) It is estimated that the total loan amount will be about 15 billion yuan, which will be underwritten by the Farmers Bank of China. (2) All manufacturers who borrowed spring cocoon funds this year, operate reasonably, and comply with the loan methods, and new manufacturers with more than 80 silk reeling machines can apply for loans. (3) Manufacturers with spring cocoon loans can transfer their down payment to the purchase of autumn cocoons. New manufacturers applying for loans must pay a 30% down payment according to the loan ratio. (4) The loan interest rate is tentatively set at 2.5% per month. (5) The Farmers Bank of China and the China Silk Company will jointly establish a loan management office to manage the approval, use, and pledge of loans. (6) All manufacturers applying for loans must register with the loan management office on the sixth floor of No. 88 Bowuyuan Road before September 15. After consultation and approval, the contract will be signed and the loan will be issued. Silk manufacturers have been registering with the loan office one after another these days. It is expected that cocoon shops in various places can open one after another starting on the 20th of this month.</p>
<p>The First Day of the Stock Exchange Market Practice  Employees Were Full of Curiosity and Joy  [Special Report] The Shanghai Stock Exchange, which had been called for a thousand times and finally came out, held a grand opening ceremony the day before yesterday. Yesterday morning and afternoon, it continued to practice the procedures for trading, settlement, and reconciliation. The practice results have not yet reached the "realistic" stage. If the official auction is approved on the 12th, I am afraid that the trading procedures will not be as skilled as expected.</p>
<p>Brand New Equipment  Noisy Waves  The leading figures in charge of this Stock Exchange are all experienced people. Therefore, all the designs and measures of the Stock Exchange have their theoretical and practical basis. Since the curtain of the Stock Exchange was opened, everyone has been looking at it with new eyes. The feeling everywhere is novel, especially the new settings such as the trading counters in the market and the establishment of the new settlement and reconciliation system, which are all epoch-making creations in our country. However, precisely because they are too new and too special, the unskilled and rigid scenes of yesterday occurred!</p>
<p>When the reporter arrived at the market, trading had already begun, but the access control was very strict. The reporter finally entered the market under the leadership of Yang Yinpu, the assistant manager of the Stock Exchange. At the entrance, the sound of shouting and selling and the noisy ringing of telephones hit the eardrums directly. It was a mixture of chaos! The six trading counters in the middle row and the brokers' telephone counters in the corridors on the east and west sides were all surrounded by black crowds. The whole transaction was like a raging tide surging and surging!</p>
<p>Distribute Trading Counters and Fill Out Small Market Accounts  Twenty listed securities are distributed on six trading counters. The two counters in the center, No. 9 and No. 10, are matched with six stocks including China Factory, China Underwear, Tongyi Yarn Factory, and Wing On Yarn Factory. The brokers around these two counters are the most crowded. The other two counters, No. 7 and No. 8, are matched with seven stocks including Great China Match, Wing On Company, China Cement, Jingfu, Wuhe Weaving, and Datong Yarn Factory. There are also two counters, No. 11 and No. 12, matched with seven stocks including Jinglun, Xinyu Yarn Factory, China Textile Yarn Factory, China-made Enamel, Xinguang Underwear, Liann Department Store, and Rongfeng Yarn Factory.</p>
<p>Transactions are carried out outside the trading counter. After receiving the client's commission, the broker must go to the designated trading counter to check the market situation if they want to buy or sell a certain stock. In addition to shouting, the transaction should also be assisted by reaching out. The palm is inward when buying and the palm is outward when selling. After the transaction is completed, the selling broker shall make a "small market account" for each transaction, including the type, quantity, price, the numbers of the buying and selling brokers, and the date. Four copies are made and thrown into a special box set up on the designated trading counter for the Stock Exchange to collect at any time. The remaining two copies are held by the buyer and seller as a receipt.</p>
<p>Inside each trading counter, there is a floor clerk standing by with a telephone handset. When each transaction is completed, the floor clerk immediately reports the transaction price to the telephone handset. This telephone is connected to the recorders at both ends of the east and west corridors. There are three recorders at each end, each in charge of the market prices of two or three stocks. After hearing the transaction price, they immediately write it on the blackboard. The brokers' telephone operators in the corridor can contact their business offices at any time to obtain the transaction prices of each stock. When the business office needs to contact the broker or agent in the market, the telephone operator only needs to press a button, and one of the signal lights of the broker specially set up in the center of the market will light up to notify the broker being called.</p>
<p>Reporting Only the Transaction Price Does Not Suit Customers  According to the opinions of the brokers after the exercise of the transaction in the morning, the Stock Exchange only reports the transaction price without reporting the buying and selling prices. The transaction is slow, and it is impossible to find out what the buying and selling prices of a certain stock are at a certain time, which is really not suitable for customers. When the floor clerk reports the transaction price, the shouting price outside the trading counter has already changed, making it difficult for the brokers to handle the limited-price buying and selling for customers. The brokers outside the popular stock trading counters are too crowded and the order is chaotic. To have good order, it will be necessary to arrange shifts for buying and selling, but it will inevitably become slow. On the other hand, the trading counters for unpopular stocks are deserted!</p>
<p>Unfamiliar Procedures  Accounts Cannot Be Reconciled  In the afternoon, we practiced the procedures for settlement and reconciliation. The Stock Exchange authorities had specially compiled the "Collective Reconciliation Method for Securities Trading" for this purpose and distributed it to the accounting staff of each broker to read it carefully. Yesterday, when we practiced on the spot, I don't know whether the accounting staff read it carefully, or the methods set by the Stock Exchange were too profound? After practicing the settlement and reconciliation procedures, we ended up with a rigid and unfamiliar ending! Each accounting staff seemed to have the pain of being at a loss. As a result, none of the transaction accounts of more than 200 brokers could be reconciled!</p>
<p>Hua Wenyu, the chief secretary of the Stock Exchange, said to reporters afterwards: "The process of yesterday afternoon's exercise was not very satisfactory. Today, we decided to practice the procedures for settlement and reconciliation all day long. In the next few days, it may be intensified training!" Yes, the most valuable experience in life is continuous learning. What's more, it is said that many of the brokers in this Stock Exchange have never participated in this kind of noisy trading market. Once they step in, they are at a loss and don't know how to start trading. Since this Stock Exchange has appeared with a brand-new attitude, of course, it is hoped that each broker will also use the latest minds to accept new knowledge and experience. At the same time, it is hoped that the Stock Exchange authorities can take care of the various shortcomings discovered during the exercise period and improve them, otherwise, how can it be worthy of standing side by side with the two major world stock exchanges in New York and London?</p>
<p>Stipulate the Transaction Unit of Various Stocks  According to yesterday's news from the Stock Exchange, the transaction unit of 100 shares includes China Silk Industry and Meiya Silk Factory, the transaction unit of 500 shares includes Great China Match, Jinglun Socks, Tongyi Yarn Factory, Wuhe Weaving, Rongfeng Yarn Factory, and China Textile Yarn Factory, and the transaction unit of 1,000 shares includes China Cement, China Underwear, China-made Enamel, Wing On Company, Xinyu Yarn Factory, Xinguang Underwear, Jingfu Socks, Qinxing Socks, Xinya Pharmaceutical Factory, Wing On Yarn Factory, Liann Department Store, and Datong Yarn Factory.</p>

<p>International Knowledge  US Policy Toward the Soviet Union  Has Become Tougher  By US United Press, Translated by Na Yi  In recent weeks, the United States' policy toward the Soviet Union has quickly become tougher. Developments at the Paris Peace Conference and the MacLean affair further illustrate this point. However, the idea of armed conflict is not yet credible, as there are still many political and diplomatic measures that can be tried.</p>
<p>The tougher US stance toward Moscow seems to be supported by the domestic public. Some experts believe that anti-Soviet sentiment is growing even faster among the people than in official circles.</p>
<p>The fundamental reason for the growing distrust of the Soviet Union is its unacceptable attitude toward various peace-building conferences, as well as its special ambitions in Central Europe.</p>
<p>American public opinion believes that since the victory over Japan a year ago, Soviet diplomacy has been aimed at establishing a "new balance" of power between the East and West systems, rather than striving for universal security worldwide, as the United Nations had hoped for during the war. At the same time, Americans are deeply afraid that the Soviet Union is attempting to foster economic revolutions in formerly democratic countries.</p>
<p>However, all seems not yet lost. Some diplomats in Washington are considering simplifying diplomatic procedures in order to alleviate the current disputes. Lengthy and fruitless debates at conferences have only increased anxiety and have not solved problems. Exchanging notes through normal diplomatic channels, clearly stating the difficulties of the issue, and forcing the other party to express its true opinions may be a more direct and effective approach.</p>
<p>The Soviet Union Will Not Dare to Fight Within Five Years  The idea that a third world war may be coming is considered incredible by authorities, but the theory of a new balance of power is gaining ground.</p>
<p>The Soviet Union has gained a significant amount of land and power during and after the war, and can at least close itself off for a long period of time. Washington believes that the Soviet Union will not dare to engage in another world war for at least five years due to technical problems: (1) It is not yet as advanced as its potential enemies in the production of atomic bombs, although it is believed that the Soviet Union has made significant progress in this area; (2) the Soviet Union's steel production is only a quarter of that of Western countries; (3) the strength of the Western countries' air forces is still stronger than that of the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Western countries are also not prepared for war. The traditional policy of the United States has always been non-aggressive, and most people believe that effective diplomatic and economic measures can achieve world peace and security. In addition, a large number of Americans have not forgotten that the United States and the Soviet Union were great and powerful allies in the war against Nazi Germany.</p>
<p>Britain also does not seem to be a likely aggressor against the Soviet Union. The problems of Palestine, Egypt, and India are already difficult enough.</p>
<p>Since a new war seems illogical to both Eastern and Western countries, diplomatic observers in Washington believe that the future development will inevitably be a continuation of continuous and firm diplomatic struggle, until the Soviet Union fully understands the determination of Western countries to maintain democracy and limit Soviet expansion.</p>
<p>Therefore, some people in Washington believe that Soviet leaders should take some initiative as soon as possible to restore the trust of Western countries in the Soviet Union, otherwise the gap between East and West will deepen, and some politicians may create new fears about the intentions of the Soviet Union, resulting in a serious situation.</p>
<p>International Weekly  Turbulent Europe with Many Events  The Division Between East and West Has Become a Foregone Conclusion  September 9.  This week, although only seven days long, has seen many disturbing events in the international arena. Not only does it prove that the post-war world is not easy to achieve peace, but it also shows that this troubled world is in turmoil every day. In Asia, the Indian interim government has been formed by Nehru, but the Muslim League has consistently refused to cooperate and will take "direct action," putting India in danger of civil war. In Iran, there has recently been a conspiracy to overthrow the Sadr government. Iran is a country that never has a day of peace. In the Arab countries of Asia, the illegal Jewish immigration issue has caused a great uproar. Britain will convene a round table conference in London to solve the Palestine problem, but the Arabs are unwilling to meet with the Jews. Therefore, this problem is also difficult to have any hope of solving.</p>
<p>Europe Is Turbulent and Fraught with Danger  In Europe, this week is the autumn of many events. The result of the Greek referendum was a victory for the royalists, with 75% of voters supporting the return of King George II. In the eyes of Britain and the United States, this is of course a welcome event, but the Greek left wing does not recognize the results of this referendum. Soviet public opinion also believes that this Greek election was held under the pressure of Britain and the United States and cannot be regarded as the free will of the Greek people. Therefore, international contradictions, coupled with internal problems in Greece, have intertwined into very complex international problems. The Greek civil strife has reached a final juncture, posing a great threat to the peace of the Balkans.</p>
<p>The Conflict Between Britain and the Soviet</p>
<h3>Special Commissioner of the Ministry of Education in Beiping and Tianjin: The Whereabouts of Received Japanese Artifacts Remain Unknown</h3>
<p>The Investigation Team Ultimately Slams the Table and Roars in Anger</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch on the 10th] A certain Japanese collector once possessed a large collection of books, antiques, calligraphy, and paintings. After the victory against Japan, the Office of the Special Commissioner of the Ministry of Education in the Beiping-Tianjin area received them. Recently, an investigation team arrived in Beiping to investigate the whereabouts of these books and artifacts, but they are missing. The Beiping Office of the Special Commissioner of the Ministry of Education claimed that the Tianjin Office of the Special Commissioner of the Ministry of Education received them. The investigation team then summoned Wang Renyuan of the Tianjin Office for questioning. According to Wang, the books and artifacts were received by the Beiping Office, and he could not be held responsible. At the time, the investigation team sternly questioned him, and Wang slammed the table and roared in anger. The two sides parted on bad terms. Later, the investigation team issued a warning, correcting Wang's attitude, stating that Wang had an obligation to answer questions. However, the truth of this case remains unclear to this day.</p>
<h3>An Estimated 10,000 Faculty, Staff, and Students Remain in Chongqing Awaiting Transportation</h3>
<p>[The Shin Shih News Agency, Nanjing, 10th] According to a spokesman for the Ministry of Education, it is estimated that about 60,000 faculty, staff, their families, and students from various relocated schools in the rear areas need to be transported after the victory. The Ministry of Education has repeatedly sought transportation means, and the schools have also made extensive use of the Northwest Highway and the Sichuan-Hunan Highway. As of now, approximately one-half of the faculty, staff, and students from the relocated schools have reached their destinations, approximately one-quarter are en route, and one-quarter remain in the rear areas. There are still nearly 10,000 faculty, staff, and students in Chongqing awaiting transportation. The Ministry of Education is continuing to work on solutions.</p>

<h3>Teachers' Salaries Cannot Be Higher Than Civil Servants</h3>
<p>Mayor Wu Responds to Representatives of the Shanghai Municipal Secondary School Teachers' Association. At the invitation of Mayor Wu this month on the 7th, the Shanghai Municipal Secondary School Teachers' Association sent 12 representatives from the board of directors to the municipal government conference room to present their opinions on improving teachers' salaries, hoping that the Education Bureau would pay salaries on the 15th of each month to meet teachers' living expenses and budget, and that the arrears for August would be paid immediately. They also requested an adjustment to the basic salaries of faculty and staff. Mayor Wu immediately expressed earnestly that he would do his best to protect the rights of all faculty and staff. He stated that the delayed payment of salaries in the past would be improved as much as possible in the future. However, the government authorities set the salaries of civil servants and teachers, and teachers' salaries could not be higher than those of civil servants. He said that it would be difficult to comply with other requests from teachers. It is reported that the association will convene a board of directors meeting on the afternoon of the 14th to discuss everything.</p>

As a result of a thrilling match, Friendship Team defeated Friendship Association by a score of two to one, wiping away the humiliation of their previous defeat, fulfilling their wish. Before that, there were two acts of the Class B finals. In the first match, Soviet B easily defeated Huaguang, and Huayanhua powerfully defeated Renyu. The scores were both two to zero. The situation in the three matches was as follows:</p>
<p>In the first match of the Class B finals, Soviet B relied on its height and strength, frequently delivering smashes. The team has absolute ambition for the Class B championship. Their strength is indeed among the best in Class B. They successively won the first two games with scores of 21-7 and 21-13. Judging from the performance of Soviet B, it is very likely to win the championship. In the second match, Huayanhua vs. Renyu, the former was more balanced, with someone on both offense and defense. In the first game, Luo Yanhua won 21-17. In the second game, Renyu was extra cautious, but ultimately could not avoid a crushing defeat. The score was 22-20. Huayanhua won two to zero.</p>
<p>Women's Group Battle</p>
<p>In the final match, the women's group unfolded a great battle. The Friendship Team was determined to avenge their defeat and went all out from the start. Huang Mingyuan and Zhang Yixuan unleashed their power together, while Friendship Association relied on Chen Meizhen's fierce spike, closely following behind. The scores fluctuated until 14 points each. Then, the Friendship Team suddenly found their rhythm, and Wang Weizhen's saves were meritorious, allowing them to take the lead all the way, instantly winning the first game 21-14. Friendship Association was not discouraged in the first game. When the Friendship Team took the lead 10-7, Friendship Association gave a shout, and the entire team displayed tacit cooperation, with the score gradually rising, resulting in Friendship Association winning a game back with a score of 21-13.</p>
<p>Final Victory</p>
<p>In the final game, at a critical moment of life and death, the Friendship Team was determined to win. They worked together with one heart, either smashing or hitting, all with ease. Wang Weizhen's brave saves and Chen Meizhen's spikes were both wonderful performances. At 11-7, the Friendship Team took the lead and switched sides. Friendship Association was distracted, allowing the Friendship Team to do whatever they wanted. The Friendship Team then secured the final victory with a score of 21-15. The results of the three matches are as follows:</p>
<p>[Friendship Team] Rong Shujian, Zhang Yixuan, Liu Zhenbao, Wu Lielei, Wang Weizhen, Huang Mingyuan, Yang Wenjuan, Xiang Yulin, Situ Mei.</p>

<h3>The Qunsheng Basketball Team from the Philippines Still Hasn't Arrived in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Lin Zhuguang, the leader of the Qunsheng Basketball Team from the Philippines, called from Xiamen the day before yesterday, saying that the team was scheduled to take China National Aviation Corporation's C-46 plane to Shanghai at 4:00 PM yesterday. Therefore, Qian Xuchang, chairman of the Basketball Association, immediately prepared for the welcome yesterday and, at 3:30 PM, together with Zhang Xiang, leader of the Hualian Basketball Team, Liu Hesheng of the Basketball Association, Cai Dawen, representative of Qunsheng in Shanghai, and Zhang Liangxiong and others, totaling more than ten people, departed from the Municipal Gymnasium in three passenger cars, arriving at Longhua Airport at 4:00 PM sharp. However, waiting until 5:30 PM, only one plane, number 108, landed, but the Qunsheng athletes were not seen. According to a passenger on the plane carrying a message from Qunsheng, plane number 108 (which came to Shanghai via Hong Kong and Xiamen) was unable to board passengers from Xiamen because there were many passengers from Shantou. The C-46 plane that the team was originally scheduled to take had not taken off from the Philippines, so Qunsheng is currently still in Xiamen waiting for a flight north.</p>
<p>[Another dispatch] The China National Aviation Corporation's C-46 plane has flown directly to Shanghai from the Philippines and did not stop in Xiamen on the way. Therefore, the Qunsheng team may not be able to leave Xiamen in one or two days.</p>
