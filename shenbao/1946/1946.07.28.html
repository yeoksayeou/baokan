<h3>司徒大使昨抵牯嶺　行裝甫卸即與馬帥晤談　對我大局已擬就新建議</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿七日電〕司徒大使今午十一時一刻，繼馬帥之離京而飛潯轉牯，在國共談判即將重開之始，兩氏之赴廬山，使此間政治空氣又趨沉寂，聞兩氏均將於下週星期一返京。馬帥·司徒此去目的，乃就周恩來與兩氏分別商談所提供之意見轉致蔣主席。據聞共產黨方面堅持之意見，為立即無條件全面停戰與重開政治協商會議，且擬有一類似停戰書之文件，由司徒大使携往廬山。此間目前正靜待馬帥與司徒大使之歸來，據推測，目前雙方之爭執焦點，在政府欲於恢復交通整編軍隊與停戰獲致協議後，再就過去政協所決定者，逐項付之實施。共產黨所强調必須立刻召開政協會議，實所不必，因各項基本問題均已於過去政治協商會議中獲有成議也，且因自商談伊始，共方即少誠意，每於談判將告一段落時，另提新要求，致又生枝節，推翻成議，政府雖一再讓步容忍，亦無法使談判有所進展，故政府基於過去種種教訓，不得不堅持於一切獲致協議後簽字，庶共產黨無法再施其故技。金兩氏再赴廬山，雖然全國人士均矚目於主席之是否頒發停戰令，惟整個前途實緊於共產根本態度以為斷也。</p>
<p>〔中央社牯嶺廿七日電〕司徒雷登大使，廿七日下午四時半自京抵牯，仍寓河東路八號，馬歇爾於大使行裝甫卸即往訪，暢談甚久。</p>

<p>〔中央社牯嶺廿七日電〕昆明發生暗殺案時，蔣主席即曾密令全國各行轅，各綏靖公署，各省市政府，切實保護人民之生命財產，尤以非武裝各黨派人士為甚。頃又再電切實遵行前令，並派陸軍總司令顧祝同飛昆全權處理李聞被刺一案，此為國府政務局長陳方，秘書曹聖芬，廿七日下午六時在牯舉行記者招待會時所宣佈者，陳局長並稱：主席牯嶺行館應即改稱行轅。</p>

<p>〔中央社牯嶺廿七日電〕政院秘書長蔣夢麟，廿七日下午三時由京抵牯，據稱：宋院長原擬陪馬帥同來，臨時因事終止，改派本人來牯，晉謁蔣主席，代表報告自主席離京後之政院近情，並有所請示。</p>
<h3>中國若入共黨手　三次大戰即揭開　美國神學院長之言</h3>
<p>〔中央社紐約廿六日電〕美國協和神學院長都生在此間牧師及宗教領袖之第二十八屆年會中演說稱：中國若入共產之手，即為世界第三次大戰之序幕，故中國之遭遇，對美國之安全，其關係不特異常重大，而且直接世界任何其他地方發生之事故，其重要性，均無逾於是者。</p>
<h3>蔡文治失興趣　葉劍英無話說　白魯德即由青返平</h3>
<p>〔本報北平廿七日電〕白魯德在青養病，已漸復原，近日返平，繼續工作。蔡文治請辭，據稱可無問題，彼魯屢次表示，對於此徒勞工作已失興趣，近乃連續有文章發表，一論行動集體化，一論試騐原子彈的意義，彼已許久未出席軍調部三方會議。葉劍英堅不見記者，謂無話可說，羅瑞卿辭共方參謀長，已決定陳士渠　除，共方人士承認共軍退出加舉，並謂四十九師師長王鐵漢被俘後押　中途逃脫，以結束王被俘說。又稱副軍長確被俘，共方對李立三瀋陽之行，同樣不　期待，認不會有何收獲。</p>

<h3>顧大使在美談話　認馬帥之努力並未失敗　我政府對外商無意作過份限制</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓廿七日電〕顧維鈞大使今稱：關於國共問題，中國政府希望能和平解決，不信共產黨願負「陷國家於內戰」之責任。馬歇爾特使為促使中國和平而作之努力，本人認為並未失敗，希望馬使繼續在中國努力。中國政府無意以法律對外人在中國經商作過份限制，使其蒙受損失，中國願與外國交易，且冀外國商人能卜居並工作於中國，一如過去。中美商約或可於數星期內簽定，此項商約足以證明中美間之商務往來，固甚活躍，而中國政府亦無妨害發展中美商務之意。顧夫人現仍暫居倫敦，可望於數星期內來美。</p>
<h3>縱火焚燒後共軍潰退　國軍收復天長城　谷正綱撥款辦如皋急賑</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿七日電〕天長已於今晨十時正式收復，聞共軍退却前，先在城內多處縱火焚燒，嗣即向西北狼狽潰退，國軍於火光熊熊中進駐天長城區。</p>

<h3>民主同盟起內爭　張瀾羅隆基太談中立與不中立</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京廿七日電〕民主同盟內部最近發生中立與不中立之爭，此於民盟主席張瀾與羅隆基今日因此發生公開之爭論一事，頗足顯示二氏對於中立與不中立之說法各有不同，張氏為主張中立論者，渠於日前在成都華西晚報發表「民盟的態度與作風」一文，曾說明民盟之態度稱：「羅隆基先生在上海談話，曾說我們民盟對國共兩黨不是中立，而是有是非，道是以個人說話，一時小有錯誤，我們民盟向來是站在民盟的立場，對於國共兩黨，則必須確守中立，站在國家立場，對於國共兩黨的行動，則必須明辯是非。」張氏又稱：「民盟是願遵奉三民主義的，也是願擁護蔣主席的，假使三民主義能實行，政治民主化，軍隊國家化，不成誑語，我們民盟對於當權的國民黨，方且傾心悅服，豈止做個尾巴。」據悉：張氏此文發表後，據羅隆基對人表示，渠在上海之談話，係稱民盟站在中國人民立場，對中國內戰無所謂中立，只有外國人，始有嚴守中立之必要，羅氏認為：張瀾之說話或因未明渠之談話內容所致。羅氏並稱：民盟總部現在南京，彼個人說話，自有其根據，以後民盟文件，應以總部發表者為準，至張氏之交，或係別人代筆者。</p>

<p>（問）昆明暗殺案情形如何？</p>
<p>（答）政府對該案殿堂重視，曾派要員赴昆調查，行政院原曾令全國各地，對人民生命財産負保護責任，當此時局緊張之際，自當特別加發護衛。昆明有十二位民盟人員避入美國領事館者，行政院特電令該地當局，若彼等願意由政令保護，應盡力負責保護而不妨礙其行動自由，現該案雖巳獲有綫索，唯在未能完全明瞭真相之前，不擬加以揣測。但如事實真相查明，不管其何方所爲，必予嚴辦。</p>

<p>（問）　司徒雷登大使到任後，國共商談希望極有轉機，馬使今又重飛牯嶺，請告商談近況如何？軍事情形如何？　廿二日莫斯科電台曾抨擊美國未能依照三國外長會議之決議，完成撤退，政府對莫斯科電台之力促美軍撤退，有何觀感？　文滙報曾被本市警局藿停刊七天，有何法律根據？（答）和平談判發展迅速詳見報載，除此外別無可資發表者。政府曾命令停職二週，後復延長十日，商談之時間不可謂不長，應可獲利解決，然竟不能。政令感覺其重點在於　軍隊之整編統編，　恢復交通。以上二點，實有同等之重要。中共迄至日前止，仍只提「無條件停戰」，吾人均爲停戰而努力，惟同時吾人不可忽略若干迫切之問題，急待解決。如吾人將此等問題，置而不問，而僅空談「無條件停戰」，則其意義將無異於東北之無條件割據，交通之無條件截斷，以及軍隊擴充與軍費增加之無條件競爭。一言以蔽之，此將無異於無條件延長政治軍事之混亂局面，而陷國家於困境。共黨建議「無條件停戰」實由於共黨巳違反政協會議協定，佔據東北大部份土地，更企圖延長經濟混亂局面，以獲「革命」機會。今略舉數證，說明經濟上之痛苦，物價高漲，民不聊生等等，大半實出於山東河南蘇北之被共軍封鎖。其故　兩主要鐵道津浦路平漢路一斷，南北貨運即告中斷，物價高漲，難民亦不得返家；　煤斤之主要産地在山東河南等省，今日或被破壞，或産量極微，略於停頓，京、滬、平、津等地用煤竟須賴秦皇島遠首運來供給，因此價格竟高達廿三萬元一噸；　平、津、濟、青糧食之給養，向賴各該市以外之盪然無存，平津每月需米六十萬市担，濟青兩市月需廿四萬市担，胥仰給於冀魯兩省鄉村，今日因被共軍封，鎖須京滬兩地予以接濟，然京滬亦非産米地區，於是間接而影響及於京滬各在，致命糧食問題愈益嚴重，而遍及全國；　根據廿五年調查鑒之産糧，冀爲八百萬担，魯爲七百五十萬担，蘇北爲九百萬担，全國總産額四千八百萬担，消費量三千四百萬担，今河北産鹽區三分之一爲共軍佔領，山東及蘇北産區則大部在中共手中，致鹽不能外運，使華北華中俱鬧鹽荒，由此可見，經濟之困難與共軍封鎖政策有深切關係。交通恢復與否，實與人民有切身利害，決不能長此延宕，故停戰因爲政府素所主張，然停戰以外各種急迫問題，亦俱應一併予以解決。</p>
<p>關於第二點，美軍在華援助多年，與勝利之關係極大，即勝利以後，所有接收，遺俘等工作，其幫助亦大，吾人對此，誰不感佩。目前遺俘等工作尚待其協助，將來中國在整軍隸軍上，亦切盼其在技術上能予以援助。現美軍大部巳撤回，僅留下極小部分在華，與我主權毫無損害。去年美國政府曾宣布其對華政策，聲明在中國被告擴大政府基礎之條件下，予中國以經濟援助，吾人深信美國之動機，實基於誠摯之友誼，而吾人亦巳努力保藏實現。蓋此亦即吾人之目的也。但共黨對於問題之解決，一南拖延，實足使吾人懷疑共黨獲知美國之意向，則愈交拖延其與政府之合作。共黨之態度，蓋欲避免各種問題之解決，而冀因經濟之困難，千萬混亂之局面，俾便彼等能於不久將來，取得國家政權。此種策略，顯然足以摧毀美國對華政策之最後目標，而使中美合作互助之實現無限延期。</p>
<p>第三點：文匯報係上海市警察局根據戒嚴法，出版法執行者，中宣部別無意見，唯　望在此時局緊張時期，嗣後對文字紀載，應特別慎重，並切盼與政府合作。</p>
<p>其他問題</p>
<p>（問）國大即將召開，在召開前政府對改組是否有何計劃？</p>
<p>（答）政府隨時能改組，改組之範圍能大能小，但必先使各項基本問題能先獲切實之解決，若不能行獲一切實之解決，則政治勢亦不能獲真正密切合作。</p>
<p>彭部長嗣對蘇聯「消息報」攻擊救國日報一事指出我報界對有關邦交之言論，極應都發生處理。渠稱：「一個紙之言論，不能代表多數人意見，但無論對蘇，對美，對英法，目前俱應避免刺激盟邦感情之文章，當此千載一時之建設機會，應埋頭苦干三十五十年，萬勿隨便批評外國」。並謂：今日有少數報紙種種攻擊美國之論調，實應避免。</p>
<p>至此，時巳五時十五分，因彭部長尚須招待名外報記者，當即宣布散會。</p>

<p>社論</p>
<h3>要和平，爲的是誰？</h3>
<p>馬歇爾特使前天又由京悶潯轉上牯嶺，爲中國和平而奔走。他和司徒大使，都以這樣的高年，冒着炎暑，冒着云雨，數天之間，迴旋於京牯的天空，爲的是要求中國的和平。</p>
<p>我們做中國老百姓的，看見在國家戰勝之後，還要怎樣煩勞盟友，既慚愧，又痛憤。慚愧的是：中國人自家的事爲什麽不能自家了？盟友這樣苦口婆心，中午善導，爲什麽還不能激發中國人的天良來自救和平之道？痛憤的是：中國人尤其是約佔百分之八十的中國農民，受到天災人禍，巳瀕於死亡的邊緣，而偏還有野心政客，憑藉武力，製造內亂，分割國家，口頭上解決農民，實質上更使農民轉輾流徙，田園荒蕪，終至於「有家歸不得」，只好被裹脅着聽受宰割。我們在這慚愧與痛憤的雙重情結交織之中，當馬帥與司徒大使熱心奔走和平之際，實不不能再忍，想提問一句話：「要和平，究竟爲的是誰？」</p>
<p>我們先直爽的自己回答一句：「要和平，是爲的中國老百姓！」</p>
<p>也許有人以爲這句問話是多余的，其實不然。因爲有若干中外人士忽略了最重要的一點，即：中國之所以要和平，乃是爲的讓中國老百姓可以安居樂業，可以在大戰之後讓老百姓一氣，由安居而樂業，由樂業而復興建國。惟其他們漠視了這一重點，就不免多少看錯了，以爲中國要和平是爲的可以讓黨派分割政權，或者以爲中國要和平是爲的可以讓中國問題不致引起第三次世界大戰。其實，這些都與中國老百姓不相干，就算有若干關係，也斷不是直接的，更不是老百姓的切膚之痛。中國老百姓所最關心的是他們可以還鄉，可以回家，可以讓他們耕種田地，可以有工廠礦塲讓他們做工，可以有通行的鐵路航路讓他們運貨往來，貿遷有無的經商。總言之，他們最粗淺簡單的要求，「安居樂業」四個大字而巳，要謀取和平者，爲此，怕以從事於和平運動者，不論中外人士，必須都着眼於此，方有正當途徑可尋，方有確實結果可得。假使不替老百姓如何能夠安居樂業着想，卻只從某黨某派如何可以在政權中分一杯羹，如何在軍權中割佔一省市這些條件設想，只是舍本逐末的辦法，用心雖苦，而究有幾分收效，將依然大成問題。</p>
<p>我們敢說：和平是手段，而老百姓的安居樂業纔是目的。政令對老百姓所應負的責任，也就是使老百姓得以安居樂業。假使用和平的方法，可以讓老百姓幸獲「安居樂業」之福，儘可和平談判，我們不但不反對，而且歡迎之不暇；反之，假使政府儘管一味和平談判，而老百姓依然不能還鄉，不能回家，不能安居，不能樂業，甚且更增加他們離鄉失業的痛苦，一如蘇北魯南和中原晉北一帶的情形，試問政府將如何對得起老百姓？再舉幾個實例來說：京滬青濟這些都市，工商業如何復興？不待說，必須有賴於蘇皖魯豫農田和煤礦的生産。如果蘇北皖北魯豫交界的淮河流域始終讓那企圖分割中國的共黨軍隊盤據，弄得鐵路公路不暢通，糧食煤炭不供給，怎樣可望這些地方的工商業得以復蘇？又如平津一帶，情形也相同，倘使山西境內和津浦北寗兩路沿綫的共黨軍隊始終在跳梁作崇，則平津一類都市怎麽可複興和繁榮？因之，我們以爲今天的問題，實在巳不是和平不和平的問題，而是政府究竟能夠保護人民安居樂業與否的問題。這是政府的責任！政令決不能因有某黨某派的作梗，因不某軍某師的搗亂，而推諉着不能關閉和平解決之門，就聽老百姓永遠在熬苦，在流徙，在離鄉失業之中而坐視不救！政府如果只知裝着「和美的幌子，不管老百姓的死活，天下一切罪惡，皆躲在「和平」的護符下去蔓延，則老百姓將課政府以責任的。</p>
<p>說到這裏，我們不能不欽佩紐約時報觀察的正確。紐約時報廿四日的評論，以爲中國和平問題，如有「任何抗議，不應指向國民政府及其擁擠者，而應痛斥反對該政府及分割中國者。」這真是一針見血的論斷。中國今日的一切問題，都起因於內內外外有若干人企圖「分割中國！」惟其妄想分割中國，於是不惜反對國民政府，於是不誣詆中國的領袖，於是不惜降低中國的國際地位，於是不惜製造中國的內亂，於是不惜利用兇暴的俘虜，使他們用其軍火來殺中國人，於是不惜裹脅中國善良的農民，從而破壞鐵路，搶刧物資，於是不惜損害法幣的信用，挑起勞資的惡感，擾亂整個的金融和市面。他們的種種手段，其目的惟恐中國不亂，惟恐中國人民有飯吃，惟恐中國人民能在戰後安居樂業，更惟恐中國在戰後若干年內能如吾人所期望，成功一個強大統一而民主的中國。他們所掛的口頭禪是「和平」，而他們的行動，無一不與老百姓所希望的和平背道而馳。</p>
<p>所以在今天，我們願率真的向中國自稱第三者的黨派領袖和美國的公正友人提醒一句：諸君如果真要爲中國謀取和平，知心朋友認真問問老百姓的希望。中國老百姓所切望者祇有兩點：　中外所承認的國民政府，在政治上自動的更走向民主進步之路，擴大政府的基礎，縱速實行三民主義而尤其是民生主義的經濟政策。　中外所承認的國民政府，在軍事上要確實貫澈其軍政軍令統一的國策，負責保護一切善良的人民，使他們在短期內即得安居樂業，而絕無理由再讓這種不死不活的局面拖延下去。我們尤其要請有意促成中國和平者趕快警覺：諸君愈是過分推重那素以失信違約著名的中共，將愈使中共得意扇形，胡作妄爲，而迫令中國和平更難達到。必須大家回過頭來，替老百姓着想而不單替共産黨着想，然後我們所獲致的中國和平，纔是中國的真正和平，中國的永久和平。</p>

<h3>日工業多種　將由美軍接管</h3>

<h3>蘇封德文化人　採懷柔手段</h3>
<p>〔聯合社柏林廿六日電〕蘇聯在德國文化界中雙管齊下，以博取他們的友誼，一方面顧到德人和虛榮，一方面顧互德人的肚子，此種手段實爲英美所不及。據德國某知識份子說，蘇聯從不使我們覺到自己是一個戰敗國，英美則常在一定的時間，使我們感到他們是戰勝者。一個著名德編劇家說，如要發表或上演一個劇本，我們必須自己向美國人接洽，方能實現，蘇聯方面則不惜移樽就教，甚至用特殊的物質條件，以誘導藝術家與之合作。據若幹德國家說，在國內麵包缺乏，羅金錢尤爲重要的時候，美軍佔領區內一個女侍者所得果腹的工資，要比最好的音樂師爲多。現在德國情形，殆祇有果腹的工資最爲要緊。</p>
<h3>白朗第因公忘危　親赴比基尼島視察　身受原子輻射襲擊</h3>
<p>〔合衆社比基尼廿七日電〕今日息：白郎第將軍於昨日視察靶子艦長號及本雪凡尼亞號時，身受原子輻射能過多，限度之外百分之五。氫輻射線安全防護組主任華倫上校稱：昨白朗第將軍如於該處多留數分鍾，則彼及其隨從人員或俱將嚴重損害。</p>
<h3>德統治問題剖視　美國新聞處譯自「美國新聞」</h3>
<p>建立歐洲和平的事情，巳由於德國是否應保持統一，或分成四個的問題遭遇困難。美英主張維持德國統一，把四個佔領區合併爲一。美英現在駐德佔領軍每年經費達五萬萬元，如果他們的主張實現，也許就可把佔領軍的數目減少。貝爾納斯建議美國的軍力仍使用廿五年，以資保證重建後的德國保持厞武裝狀態，不致擾亂和平。蘇法兩國反對德國統一，法國主張將魯爾與萊因區由德國割裂出來，在國際管制下，單獨治理。按法國的想法，如果要法國不受德國侵略的威脅，德國一定要是一個半獨立軟弱而鬆馳的聯邦。蘇聯對於如何處理今後的德國，似尚無具體計劃，不過它顯然反對美國的新計劃。目前德國巳分成四部分。</p>
<p>四強各自爲政</p>
<p>因此四佔領區的週圍都築上了奇高的隔離蘇聯佔領區在易北河以東，現在區內正進行大變革。蘇萬開始封閉銀行，沒收資産，他們把容克世家所有的資産分　了農民，又使礦塲與工廠工人組成高高在上的啊工會，其形式與蘇聯工會類似，蘇聯當局使廠主在下述二種前途中抉擇其一，即工廠聽從職工會的命令經營，否則拆卸後送往蘇聯。美觀察家報告：蘇境內像一個緊張萬分的峰房，失業人數似巳減少，工廠目前的生産巳抵得生産力百分之九十。蘇軍佔領區內的出地，合全德可耕地百分之廿七，産量足以供養區內二千一百萬人。</p>
<p>美國的佔領區</p>
<p>在德西部，面積與蘇佔領區相仿，除此而外，一無相像之處。田地原料與工業，都不足以供養與僱用區內一千八百萬人口。境內礦塲與工廠，一度被估計佔德生産量百分之　二十，可是此刻因爲無煤無油，無鋼鐵，橡皮等原料，一無用處。美國雖有大量食米　去，區內仍患缺米。決定不拆作賠償的工廠生産量，只及生産力百分之十至二十，於是職工幾有三分之一失業，而且市鎮大部分人口中，不論有無職業，一概食不飽，衣不暖，住不好。在這種情況之下，美方要把佔領區像美國一樣，按資本主義的民主政治重建，頗感困難。推行清除納粹勢力計劃的結果，固然發現了三十萬名納粹，可是納粹黨的浩劫，竟仍在地下進行。反納粹的黨派固巳復活，但到目前爲止，它們似乎都沒有什麽明確的方針。至於佔領工業發達的魯爾區的英國，也一樣遭遇到政治困難，但經濟上的情形，遠比美方良好。</p>
<p>英佔領軍政府</p>
<p>巳使區內工業復前産量的百分之四十，不過魯爾的煤通常代應廳德工業四分之三與歐洲工業一半的需要，目前生産還只及戰前百分之卅五。戰前德國鋼産二千二百萬噸，魯爾産最佔三分之二，今年還只能生産二百萬噸。英國佔領區的所以重要，就由於魯爾具有煤鋼兩項産量，較歐洲任何地區爲大的潛力。至於農産，離自難的程度還遠，區內人口二千三百萬，食糧輸入的需量極大，按工業的情形來說，魯爾一區合到戰前德全部生産量的百分之卅六。英國希望爲了協助歐洲重建，爲了打開英貨的歐洲市場，儘可能把魯爾的産量提高到接近戰前的水凖。不過法國始終恐懼魯爾成爲德國戰略的發電所，除非魯爾能從德國分裂出來，由包括法國在內的盟國共管。英國巳非正式提出折衷案，魯爾由國際共管五十年。法觀察家懷疑英國的計劃，將待　盟國軍事佔領德國結束時實行，如果這樣，幾年中英人一定將魯爾逐漸英國化，加緊英國對這個區域的控制。</p>
<p>法人的眼光看來</p>
<p>法國佔領區，正是法國關懷工業發達的魯爾的又一理由。在四國佔領區中法國佔領區最小最窮，它的田地，工業與人口，都只及全德百分之八，而法統治以來，一直在竭力抛售煤與建築物資，儘快運往法國。總而言之，蘇聯發行它的佔領區，按蘇聯共産主義的理想，因此土地有了改革，職工會管理工業，德共在政治上十分得勢。英國巳公營佔領區內煤礦，正想按英國工黨的政策，處理錢爾區其他的工業。美國提倡自由企業，希望以資本主義與民主政治的優點，排斥納粹的劣點。法國佔領區正反映著法國混亂而一切在試驗中的情形。由於各自爲政。</p>
<p>四區經濟孤立</p>
<p>困難愈益增多，德全境現還沒有統一的貨幣，金融與會計政策。物價各區不同，區與區之間的貿易小而不規律，往往經過軍事　　長期商談以後，按以貨易貨的辦法進行，甚至交通與運輸，也感受區界的障礙。按德國的四部分來說，沒有一區能獲利製造它所需貨品的原料，因此結果是到處發生經濟蕭條。擴大來看，整個歐洲也發生了經濟蕭條，歐洲爲重建所急需的貨品，由於沒有德國的煤與　　，德國的技藝與交通綱，也就無法相當滿足。政治上說來，德共正設法與德社會民主黨合併，數量較小的共黨，希望由此而推動合組的新機構，勢力擴及各個佔領區。這確實是一種政治統制的做法。而西文盟國最焦慮的，是德國西部經濟蕭條的現象，可能正好爲德共的勢力清道。最近美國出版商往德境美佔領區游歷，覺感目前的政策必須改變，其原因在此。他們認爲建立一個中央政府，修正波茨坦協定，也許可以使歐洲經濟復興，推倒分裂四強以至於德國的隔牆。美國務卿最近所建議的四強對德和約，原則也與美國各出版家相同。</p>

<h3>「雙槍將」馬坤會見記　豪邁熱情說話痛快　始終追隨　總理獻身於革命工作</h3>
<p>「孫總理眞是一個偉人，一個英勇的戰士！」馬坤將軍（見圖）感動地說。雖然他在電話裏再三聲明，他並沒有什麽話說，所以也實在沒有訪問他的必要，可是，一提起了總理，他的眼睛裏終於流露出興奮的光芒來了。</p>
<p>「馬坤」的「馬」是Morris，「坤」是Cohen。馬坤將軍也就是赫赫有名的「雙槍馬坤」（“Two　Gun“Cohen）。這是一個不平凡的外號，這外號所表示的也是一個不平凡的性格：豪邁，熱情，說話痛痛快快，毫不拖泥帶水。從一九〇八年起，他就追隨總理，獻身於反抗滿清的革命，這次到上海，頭髮也已經全白了，然而還是步履矯健，滿面紅光，看他這種精力充沛的樣子，眞看不出他已經是一個年逾花甲的老人。</p>
<p>他說，自從一九〇八年在加拿大和孫總理見面之後，就從來沒有離開過總理。「我常在總理旁邊，看他辛苦地整理那些演講稿，常常陪他到深夜。他到許多地方演說，我也總是在他左右。就是在他逝世的時候，我也還是伴着他的。」他的聲音漸漸嚴肅起來：「以後，我就護送他的遺體，一直到現在奉安的地方。」</p>
<p>他站了起來，在厚厚的地毯上往來蹀　着，忽然回過身來，立定了，他說，「但是，總理在臨終之前不久對我說的話，我是忘不了的。他說，我們國民黨在推翻滿清這一點上是已經成功了，但是我們還應當建立一個比清朝更好的政府，這一點，却是到現在還沒有做到的」</p>
<p>他的話使我想起了「時代雜誌」。果然，臨窗的小茶几上，一陣陣的涼風正吹動着一本「時代雜誌」的書葉。</p>
<p>馬坤說，總理「革命尙未成功，同志仍須努力」的話，實在也就是指這一點說的。</p>
<p>「還有一點，你也應當告訴大家。總理說過，中國是一個新的國家，所以，正可就現在各國的制度和思想中，挑取最適於中國需要的精華，而不必祗去倣效任何某一個國家。總理說，哥崙布到美洲去是繞大圈子的，我們却可以一直去了。」</p>
<p>他強調總理人格的偉大。他說，總理於工作辛勤之後，常常出去散步，以資消遣。每逢看見路邊窮苦的老年農夫，往往極仁慈地和他們閒話家常，問他們有什麽苦痛，而且談得很久。「他並不知他們談政治，他祗是眞心地關切他們。他忽然激動起來，呌着說，我是國民黨。什麽左傾右傾中立我都不管，我祗覺得老百姓是最要緊的！」</p>
<p>誠然，這位「雙槍將」是一個很直爽的人，但是要說他天眞却實在恐怕未必。也許，到了中國幾十年之後，誰也不該再天眞了罷？馬坤將軍似乎不是外交家，因之他的處處小心翼翼，使他非常吃力，而天氣又是那麼悶熱，於是，我很愉快地握了握他那只碩大無朋的手，滿意地走出了那間精微而舒服的房間。（平肅）</p>
<h3>社局統計室主任履新計劃編製「工資指數」</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕市社會局新任統計室主任曹效登，業於廿三日到局履新，據談今後統計室工作，除將繼續舊時經常工作，若整理勞資糾紛等統計數字外，將與本市若干公團機關，聯合進行一偉大計劃，即編製「工資指數」是。今日市府統計處每月有生活指數之發布，實有助於薪水階級人士工資之調整，唯今日工資與戰前工資，究相差若干倍，迄尙無確切統計數字，可資比較。致勞資雙方，對工資倍數一點，每易有所爭執，若編製「工資指數」之計劃得以實現，則類比紛爭，始可迎刃而解。唯工資有各種不同標準，千頭萬緒，若職員與工人之分，技術工人與職業工人之分，生手與熟手之分等等，設定統計標準，亦殊不易，故曹氏所談，目前亦尙在計劃階段中。唯悉，一且得蒙上級機關批准，當與本市勞動協會等團體合作，共同努力。曹氏江蘇阜寗忍，當任職渝市府統計處，並在復旦大學敎授統計學等學科，自陪都飛來滬上，尙未兼旬。</p>
<h3>薛劍秋出綁後被檢舉為漢奸　假冒同鄉寄藏肉票　市府警衛隊長入獄</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕分配房屋委員會內，日前發生綁架薛劍秋一案，破獲經過，已詳本報。惟如何將肉票置放於市府警衛隊內，其中經過曲折。緣主犯章西夫與市府警衛隊隊長方保揚係同鄉，情感彌篤，當章伴同肉票薛劍秋遊興闌珊，由水上飯店回來時，已午夜十二時，遂折入市府警衛隊，向方偽稱，鄉間忽來二友，因時值深夜，無處開房間，可否暫假尊處權宿一宵。當經方答伊此間無床鋪，章說好在暑天不妨席地而臥，方不疑有他，乃隨口允諾，而薛因過去曾任敵偽密探，心虛萬分，任其擺佈，不敢作聲。茲悉方保揚昨已由警局刑二課將其拘捕，鋃鐺入獄矣。</p>
<p>又肉票薛劍秋，昨為黃浦分局警員周某至總局檢舉，略稱：薛劍秋於民國卅一至卅四年間，在浙江諸暨担任敵寇梅部隊機關翻譯及偽諸暨政治保衛局特務員，領導敵軍進入諸暨橫山溪北楓橋，燒去民房一千餘幢，代敵寇强　民糧，陷害我方地下工作人員，現任警備部稽查處副處長鄭重，曾受其酷刑，檢舉人曾被其關閉達十六個月，腿部被刺傷，仍有傷痕可見云云，市警局對此現正嚴密偵查中。</p>

<h3>中信局低產處　計劃解決房荒　籌建新屋先給公教人員　目前正整理敵偽房地產</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕記者昨晤中央信任局地產處副經理江梁氏談及本市房地產一般情形。據稱自勝利以來，政府有鑒於各地房荒嚴重，特委託中央信託局儘量興建新屋以謀解決。本市方面已在籌備計劃中，一俟資金之供給，利息之規定及付償之辦法等確定以後，即可開始分批建築。第一批為供給公敎人員居住之房屋，其次為工人及一般平民住宅，然後接受私人及機關之委託，建築比較精美之屋宇。目前上海空地甚多，雖大多在江灣閘北滬西等地，但祗須有房子，固不論距離之遠近。惟建築一事，非可一蹴而成，大約須一年之後，方可有相當主要工作，係整理所接收之敵偽房地產。此項房地產，由敵產處理局交來，加以勘察丈量，辦理產籍後，公開出售，以充國庫。但目前已售出者極少，大多為各機關暫時借用，局方除徵收使用費外，並保留出售之權。又有若干原為英美人士之產業而為敵偽侵占者，接收以後，由我方保留一年之租賃權，期滿則仍交還原主云。</p>
<p>〔又訊〕據確息，市政府對解決本市房荒問題，即將積極採取各種切實有效之步驟，此項步驟之內容，可分二點：　減輕土地負擔，以提高土地投資利潤。實施具體辦法，目前雖尙未完全確定，但聞已定於一定期間之內，土地稅及土地買賣之各項稅則以及房捐等，可能減免，甚或停徵一二年。　鼓勵金融界大量投資於房屋建築及舉辦低利建屋貸金，此點聞南京杭州兩地，業已先後實行。因上海游資極多，若能使資金轉向於建築方面，則實為解決屋荒最積極而有力效之辦法也</p>

<h3>從DDT談到：假藥的嚴重性</h3>
<p>— 陳方之</p>
<p>DDT，是科學的結晶，是世界大戰勝利的第一位功臣，本來是救國救世的東西，但是到了中國人手裏，竟會變成騙人的幌子，說起來頗是感慨無量。</p>
<p>近來各報上，都記載關於DDT的文章，熱鬧得很，我把牠彙讀一下子，其用意可歸納到兩點：第一宣傳藥性的功用，第二為揭破假藥的黑幕。但我覺得其重量還不夠，所以來補充些一知半解的愚見。</p>
<p>DDT的功用，在於殺死昆虫，而其最終目的，則為防止疾病。因為大多數劇烈的傳染病，都與昆虫有關係，其性質，可分為兩類：（甲）昆虫媒介類。這一類病，非昆虫的媒介不可，無昆虫即無此病；如蚊之傳瘧，蟲之傳回歸熱及斑疹傷寒，砂蟲之傳砂蟲病，白蛉子之傳黑熱病是。（乙）非昆虫媒介類。這一類病，從醫學上說，雖非昆虫做媒介，但昆虫可以做菌郵，將其菌四方散佈，如蚤能將鼠身上的鼠疫菌，傳到人身上去；蠅能將霍亂，傷寒，赤痢菌，從污物帶到事物上去是。不獨如此，當軍隊露宿荒野，一切小虫的刺　，即使不足以引起傳染病，亦足以妨礙睡眠，釀成皮膚病，所以美軍在南洋，到處用DDT，以撲滅一切昆虫，其對於增進作戰力，眞是一大功。</p>
<p>不過DDT的功能，不是馬馬虎虎使用，所能顯出來的。其用法，必需選擇適當，其用量必需算定充分。例如殺空氣中飛來飛去的昆虫，用噴霧蒸發方式就可以，但是要殺臭虫蚤虫虱等小東西，則非點滴或注射不可，用於一室或一個小團子內，少許份量就可以，但是要殺滅廣大城市內的昆虫，那非隨其面積體積，算足其大量不可。這次南京市上空，用飛機散佈了DDT，但効力薄弱，還是　蚋滿街亂飛，與論並不良好，甚至有人懷疑到科學的本身，這恐怕是用的方法不周密罷。</p>
<p>深刻的說起來，DDT，並不是富貴人家的享樂品，而是公眾防疫的必需品，要預防疫病，根本非從貧民區域做起不可，富貴人家。零星買幾瓶DDT散澈，與防疫的宏旨，無甚大關係，所以賣假藥的奸商，用DDT做幌子，騙了幾個錢，其罪　，還不至於十八層地獄去。</p>
<p>假藥的最大禍患，莫過於磺物類，盤尼西林，六〇六，　滌平等的假貨，立刻可以直接的誤人生命，這種奸商，眞是罪該萬死。那一類藥品，是救命的特效藥，即使並非假貨，而偷工減料，含量不足的劣貨，也足以誤人生命。</p>
<p>我在重慶，有一位朋友患回歸熱，他自己買了一瓶獅牌六〇六，打進去竟毫無効力，後來把其玻璃管，來仔細揣詳，其瓶簽獅印，毫無二致，但其吸剩的半滴黃液，到了第三天，還不變黑，顯然裏面沒有含砒，完全假的。瘧滌平，撲瘧母星，常常含量不足，以致貽誤病情，大健皇之有贗鼎，消治龍之含量問題，更荒唐的，報上大登特登，說是中國能自造盤尼西林了，造出來竟是耐久不變的液體，這種吹牛程度，可稱為莫測高深，然而誤人生命，罪同殺人，法律何在，衛生署的耳目何在！</p>
<p>我以為這一種害人騙錢的藥品，決不是社會智識的問題，更不是一市衛生局的責任，而是中央政府的一個正當課題。因為化騐藥品，尤其是分析藥品的成分，要有設備，要有人才，在中國的現況，決不是一市的能力，所能辦到，然而中央政府的責任，決不可漠視法律的失效，人民的受騙，醫藥的淩亂，而眼開眼閉不管的。</p>

<p>民政簡報</p>
<h3>公職候選人　檢覈之重要　民政處長張曉崧談</h3>
<p>中央爲定期實施　致，還政於民，限期建立各級民意機構，並民選區長保長等自治人員，故對於本市公職候選人檢覈工作，極其重視。曾迭次電促廣爲發動市民參加檢覈，以籌備大量候選人。因爲候選人數愈多，則選擇優秀份子亦愈便，使各級民意機構，與地方自治機構，得能健全建立，其間係至爲重要。</p>
<p>今以本市各級公職候選人員數額而論，全市人口三百五十萬，可產生正式市參議員及候補參議員三六二名，正副區長六四名，正副區民代表四二一二名，正副保長二一〇六名，合計共有公職人員六七四四名。其候選人平均姑以最低數五倍計，即在三三七二〇名。換句話說，本市目前應參加甲乙種公聯候選人檢覈人數，至少須在三三七二〇名，現在本市自辦理檢覈以來，甲種合格者，僅一三二〇名，乙種合格者僅一四一〇名，資歷證件不足，或手續欠缺之飭補案件一二一五件，與上述最低數之候選名額，相差遠甚，實爲推行民主政治之一大阻力。</p>
<p>推其原因，一爲本市首次創辦公職候選人檢覈，一般市民，尚未明白認識，此點負責自治人員，應隨時多予宣傳。二為一般市民以爲暫不參加本届競選，故未送檢覈。又有外省寄居市民，以爲須隨職業變遷，無久住之意，故亦不願在本市請送檢覈，此乃對於檢覈法令尚未了解所致。因爲一經檢驗合格，即取具公職候選人之永久資格，本届不參加競選，以後無論何届，均有資格爲候選人，且不僅在送檢取之地區可以競選，如遷居其他省縣，取得公民資格，亦可在該地區參加競選。三爲資歷證件遺失，而無法取具原學校或原服務機關，及上級機關之證明文件，未能參加檢覈此點本府公職候選人應考資格審査委員會，召開第七次會議時，曾提出討論，爲顧到事實困難，曾經通過補具證件之變通辦法。擬規定甲種准由該管區公所出具證明，乙種准由該管保長出具證明，此項辦法，現正報請考試院考選委員會備案中。</p>
<p>本市區長保長將來實行民選，需要儲備大量候選人，本府　在最近發動市民踴躍參加檢覈，希望能够達到上述最低數之三三七二〇名。其方法，一，發動全市黨國機關學校，及人民團體人員，具有甲乙種檢覈資格者，均能參加檢覈。二，市區之保，每保至少須發動五十名參加檢覈，郊區之保，每保至少須發動三十名參加檢覈，限期完成。</p>
<h3>甲長任期定二年</h3>
<p>內政部昨電市政府云：査甲長任期，以無明文規定，各省屢有電詢到部，除已分別電復外，甲長任期，應比照縣各級組織綱要第三十三條及第四十八條，與鄕鎭組織暫行條例第二十九條，及五十四條鄉鎭保長副任期，規定爲二年。</p>

<p>社會局吳局長頃闡述台灣糖業公司第七期配糖經過如下：（一）改變配售辦法之原因：台糖公司自第一期至第六期向由該公司直接配售於糖菜公會，但市價逐級上昇，輿論譁然，殊與平抑物價原旨背道而馳，乃由本局商得公司同意，第七期配糖，由本局決定，以配售於零售商製造商合作社爲限，以免爲少數糖商操縱。（二）本局希望：此次本局代辦　糖審核事宜，原屬試辦性質，結果如何須待事實證明，唯一希望，在抑平糖價，普沾實惠，端賴全市市民通力合作。（甲）零售商應依照規定，原包出售每担爲八萬一千元，拆包零售每斤八百六十元，切不可抬價，變質或隱　不賣，並應將核定價格在店面前佈吿。（乙）製造商茶食業，糖果餅乾罐頭，食品業，製藥業，應將成品價格比例　減，勿以日前近利，沾沾自喜，應將目光放遠，與低價進口之糖果餅餌相競爭，維持該業本身之永久生存。（丙）醫院及合作社社員，旣經購到直接配糖，勿再向零售店購買，以免分配不均。（丁）購買零售糖應維持秩序，不可爭先擠買，台糖公司存糖充沛，嗣後每星期配售一期，食糖絕無匱乏之虞，此後配糖價格，非但不超過第十期每担七萬六千元之數，且有逐期抑低可能。（三）對於糖商請願之態度：本市各糖行大都歷史悠久，自當依法維護，惟第六期配糖後，該公會一則曰彌補前次拋空額，不能全數應市零售，一則曰第四，五期糖價較高，尚未脫手，須將前後價格扯平，不能照規定價格出售，因此本局不得不採用直接配售辦法，茲旣據糖業公會來局請願，祗須查明第六期配糖出售情形，自可予以攷盡。（四）外埠用糖申請手續：外埠糖商來滬採購配給糖，應由當地主管機關或商會證明，呈由本局核轉台糖公司，配給價格與本市同。</p>
<h3>美鈔回升金價跟進</h3>
<p>烚赤初疲後穩，晨開一八八萬五，開後廣帮雖有供給，但錢兌業等稍有納胃，爲狀徘徊，自一八九萬五退至一八八萬光景，而後吿平，十時後中央配給一二〇條，價一八九萬，此後平穩異常，後以美鈔回升，證券幫因週六對黄金亦有歸帳，午刻回升至一九二萬以上，午後因週六更爲寥寂，結果較前收回升三萬五，飾金亦提升至念萬〇五，紋銀銀元均平，暗拆銀根無變，息價仍在一角二分左右。</p>
<p>外幣初疲後回，美鈔上塲尚現恍惚，自二五〇〇元一度見跌至二四七〇元左右，美物價仍有管制，膨脹呼聲漸低，頗多出金購鈔活動，經套買之下，並有若干購貯備用之流，午刻回升至二五三〇元光景，午後平靜，結果較前收回升四十五元；港票亦被帶好八元，港匯五四五元至五五五元，印匯六六〇元至六七〇元，英匯八千七至八千九，成交均不見暢，美匯平庸無變。</p>
<h3>股票先漲後跌</h3>
<p>華股高價難於持久，週六關係，臨收有浮多了結，在戶出多進少，終吿先漲後跌，開後高價永紗見七一〇元，美亞四九〇〇元，景福二九〇元，新光二八五元，勤興一二八元，入後逐漸盤小，近午都退至低價，永紗見六六〇元，美亞四二八〇元景福二五〇元，新光二四五元，勤興一八〇元，成交已稍减色，結果與前收相較，計永紗微挫，美亞回跌半成强，景福新光勤興亦跌半成左右，較冷各中型股平平，各小型股則稍有進展，元老股亦見平穩。</p>
<p>外股仍因交稀價淡，上塲時怡紗曾進展至九七〇〇元，但不久即有多頭了結而吿盤跌·近午華股回跌，更少維持，一時供過於求减低頗多，有等竟無成交，結果較前收計會德　恰　鋼業紙業平平怡紗英聯航業等微挫。</p>
<p>公價平淡</p>
<p>公債平靜　　，各債求供不一，市價且有出入，統丙自　開七三〇元，中途先跌饑回，低價見七〇〇元而後，以七六〇元成交結束，結果較前數升五十元甲乙仍平，丁升元，丙戊種跌二十元。</p>
<h3>中蘇確在商洽中華茶交換蘇貨真相　中信局辦理易貨不限蘇俄</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕記者頃以華茶對蘇易貨問題，叩詢中央信託局某負責人，據吿：對蘇易貨事宜，本由財政部貿易委員會委託復興公司辦理。自復興公司於去年底結束業務後，中信局於本年三月初，即奉命繼續接辦復興公司之業務。惟中信局辦理對外易貨事宜，並不限於蘇聯一國。至於華茶對蘇易貨，近來確由政府當局，與蘇聯商務代辦秀立埃夫商談中。惟以數量與價格均未接洽就緒，故尚未簽訂合同。將來如合同簽就，政府須委託中信局收購茶葉時，亦將計劃在產區作全面之收貝，不致零星在市塲搜購。又該局本年初以來，亦曾接受資源委員會交通部，開　淮南等煤鐵，中國蠶絲公司等之委託，向日本盟軍總帥部，辦理易貨事宜。我國輸出之交易物資，爲鹽及麩皮兩種。盟軍總師部輸入之交易物資，有銅、各項器材，鐵路車輛材料，枕木，蠶種，桑種等。迄目前爲止，易貨之數字並不大。惟此中以鐵路材料居多云。</p>
<h3>紗花交易沉寂</h3>
<p>昨日紗市疲莫能　，交易之淸爲近來所罕見，念支雙馬紗尚能站住於一百三十萬元左右，然中小型紗支撐不住，續小二三萬，卅二支及四十二支線亦降四五萬，人心仍極不振，趨勢依然萎糜。</p>
<p>昨日紐約美棉電訊再跌一百磅　，計　日口開　　。　　　　期新花二九·一三，米　　現貨三三·〇六，本埠現楊交易全部停頓，良以美棉連跌四日，兼以週六關係，　　　無問津，是以交易寂靜。</p>
<h3>工業銀團　竟是風影之談</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕日前某通訊社傳：本市各大商業銀行，將組織大規模之工業投資銀團。記者頃以此訊，詢諸本市若干商業銀行界領袖，渠等均稱：對此事未有所聞云。</p>
<h3>中華烟草勉可維持　每月平均產量約五千箱批價比年初漲起百分十</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕記者頃訪經濟部接管中華烟草公司，詢以最近生產情形。據悉：該公司接收原中華烟草第一，第二，及第三廠後，即將一二兩廠開工。平均每日約開捲烟機四十　部，每月平均產量約五千箱。此中包括全禒，雙斧，及指南牌三種。派貨價格，本年初每箱約爲三十餘萬元，最近每箱約爲四十萬元漲起不過百分之十。以全祿牌而言，每小包（二十支裝）零售價約爲二百元。以目前原料及人工計，尚不致　蝕，惟已不能　利潤。</p>
<h3>米糖鹽　昨日均有到貨</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕食米食糖等主要糧食連續而來，招商局江漢輪，由宜昌運來川米一千噸昨晨抵埠。海皖輪自台北基艦運來食糖一千噸，昨亦進口又海康輪昨日由連雲港到滬，裝來食鹽一千九百噸，該鹽原須運往蚌埠因近來隴海路中斷，乃改海道運來，再轉運浦口，裝車運往蚌埠。</p>
<h3>米市高堅次呆油價不許再漲</h3>
<p>昨南北市塲到米七千餘石，市化高貨倘俐，價目堅挺，中下等則依然乏交而少精神，秞米高貨略有問津，中下苦無顧問，白元店方另化揀高採取，中次仍少交易，麺粉零化活潑，回漲三四百元，廠方擯而不開，小麥散戶依然揀高進取，高貨尚有交易，價格堅挺，加三四百元，中次依然少交，麩皮鄕胃暢旺，續升三四百元，黄豆到消兩敵，市勢堅穩，新黄豆去化多係菜坯，到貨零星，隨到隨銷，暫無上落·豆餅大暑時，正値銷令，售主雖堅，但去化不甚暢旺，價微升一二百元，油價今日公會奉社會局指示，以後油市祗能降低不能再高，適靑島來貨無多，故未做開。</p>
<h3>經紀人初審合格將不出五百家</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕證交籌委會小組會，對審核經紀人資格之初步整理工作，即將於日內吿竟，聞初步整理結果，順利通過者，將不出五百家。預計下週二左右，即將召開全體籌委會，對初步整理通過之各經紀人，將再作縝密之審核。大致再過一週，即可將經紀人名單，呈部核核示云。</p>
<h3>中央接辦繭貸利息已减為一分八</h3>
<p>中央銀行已決定接收春繭貸款銀團，於八月一日起，將該銀團全部債　移交該行處理，按該銀團放貸迄今資金動用爲一六九億元，貸出單位包括中蠶公司，共計五十三家，其對象均係由中　　舉者，歸定担保抵押利息四分半，此次改由中央銀行接管後，减為一分八，如此低利貸款，成本自可减輕。</p>
<h3>退票之嚴重性不如所傳之甚通常約二三十億</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕頃據上海票據交換所消息：近日來該所交換票據總張數，每日平均爲五萬餘張。交換總金額，每日平均爲一千三百餘億元。至退票張數，每日平均爲一千五百餘張，金額每日平均爲二三十億元。以六月底言，是時因銀錢業辦理决算關係，市面頭襯不無稍緊。惟最高之退票金額，亦不過一百四十餘億元，且亦僅六月二十九日一日而已。最近退票張數與金額，對交換總額所佔之百分比，極爲微小，可見一般金融情况，頗爲穩靜云。</p>
<h3>票據交換所改組正候財部核示中</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕據悉：上海票據交換所即將進行局部改組。改組後之新機構，將爲一純粹由商業銀行及錢莊所組織之票據交換所，性質上完全係一獨立之機構。聞現正候財政部核示中，一俟批准，即可改組成立。按現時之票據交換所，原係受中央銀行之委託，於去年十一月一日，開始辦理本市金融業票據交換事宜。迄目前爲止，參加該所之行莊，已達一百七十五家。</p>
<h3>桕油稍見好轉</h3>
<p>禾本售至八萬八千</p>
<p>柏油前週因受銀根影響，致稍壓低，然各皂廠需用正繁，兼又有紗廠用塲，故銷當其令，而近日浙路來源漸見稀少，所以本市行家所存手貨，祇有扳緊而售，因之市面恢復半月前之狀態，有過之無不及，且禾本尤有甚也，聞嘉興等處，已售至八萬外，本市售價，亦不得不酌加，計禾本柏油八萬八千元，內坪柏油八萬二千元，獨確柏油七萬六千元，的干柏油七萬六千元，普通　柏油七萬一千元元，麻城柏油七萬元。</p>

<h3>錢江北海岸</h3>
<p>— 本報十日杭州訊　特派員儲裕生寄</p>
<p>錢江北海岸是指乍浦，海鹽，海寗而言，就是地理上有名的杭州灣，國父計劃的東方大港，也就在澉浦，乍浦之間。這裏的居民，　海爲生，或是煮鹽，或是捕魚，但在人口的數字中，也不是頂大多數，因爲只要稍有泥土，即甚肥沃，便可耕種自食。記者得着一個機會，去考察沿海的各個地方和正在工程緊急加速搶修中的海塘。</p>
<p>泥濘路</p>
<p>是日新雨初晴，道路還十分濘滑，尤其汽車步上這杭滬公路，更別有一番滋味，顛簸，擺動的厲害，是七八年來有乘汽車經驗的人所不能想像的，公路上一個個大坑，一段　濫泥，幾使人不相信這是在公路上跑，而是在泥田中行進。坐在汽車中的人，把人抛得很高，心與臟在不斷的振盪着。聽說沉主席去時，即用一些瓦塊磚片鋪一鋪，而且沉氏坐的是小轎車，但也顛簸不堪忍耐。</p>
<p>抵海寗</p>
<p>好容易到達海寗，我們特地進城去走一遍，到這裏真是斷垣殘壁，一幢幢高大的房屋，僅矗立着一片牆，一堆敗殘的破瓦，一兩根燒燒焦了的木柱子，完整的房屋不過十分之二，縣政府借設在民房中，但我們去時，縣府已經往硤石，這裏僅有一個縣政府的辦事處。縣黨部也遷去硤石了，縣商會到還在這裏，城內稍有一些店鋪，城外也有一點市面，我嬙當地的老百姓，他們說：「海寗每況愈下了，當年這裏各條街都很繁盛，很多要人也有在這裏作寓公的，有電燈，有報紙，現在街上是被燒光了。有的人家把房屋拆去賣了，很多在外面的大好佬，再也不來了。」我問他們敵人在此地作戰過沒有？他們又告訴我「敵人在這裏打過仗呢？敵人想把海神廟前的白石獅子搬去，搬不動，把廟裏的一切設備搶去很多」。</p>
<p>海之子</p>
<p>這裏的人民並不完全靠海爲生，海水離塘近，不能煮鹽，海潮未來時，海水又淺，不能捕魚，僅有極少數的人是靠修理修理海塘生活的，其餘還是多數務農爲業。我們曾去遜清乾隆時有名的陳閣老處看看，傳說雍正無子，僅一女兒，後陳元誥將子易女，又將女配子，此子即是乾隆，陳便爲國丈，見他的門牆巍巍，旗竿環立，依然還可以辨認當年繋馬，停轎的所在，我們走進門內，也巳殘破不堪了。陳在當年也曾坐鎮海寗，督修海塘，當年文武百官都　年要到海寗來參拜或觀謁。乾隆也曾來過兩次，也曾巡視　　。</p>
<p>海神廟</p>
<p>再到海神廟，那雄偉的宮殿建築，那白石雕成的玲瓏獅子，那廟外兩　南座白石的牌坊，都使人想見當年的繁華。可見現在廟內巳盪然無存，連海神都不知道到那裏去了。縣政府，縣黨部的舊址，也相當偉大，但現在也僅存一些敗壞的柱瓦。</p>
<p>有人說，縣府將永遠遷在硤石了，因爲硤石是個商業的中心，　米的集散處。我細細想來，這　在是不大對的，以往政府所以　縣府設於海寗的意見是可以管制海塘，因爲乍浦有鹽田，海鹽也有鹽田。潮勢不見十分猛，惟獨海寗一帶，潮勢最猛，海寗的許多塘工也是這樣講的。所以海寗實際上是江南七郡的防海門戶，也是避免水災的保衛者。八九年來，敵僞爲榨取民脂，才把縣府移設硤石，致使海塘失修，幾釀巨禍，現在縣府又遷往硤石，這實在是值得考慮的一件事啊！</p>
<p>觀潮處</p>
<p>我們又到海寗的觀潮處，那裏有觀潮亭，觀潮台，還有幾只鐵牛，觀潮合砌有看台，長達十餘丈，觀潮亭的兩邊都有公園的遺址，據當地老百姓說，到潮汎時，這裏真是人山人海，甚至有在潮汎前先來租屋居住的。據說外而人來海農牧民觀潮，化在海寗的身上戰前的法幣數字估計在千萬元以上，其與西湖春秋兩季的得汎，實也不相上下了。</p>
<p>修柴塘</p>
<p>我們從海寗出來，東抵「杜槀鍾隸」塘，這裏柴塘巳快完成了，工程人員告訴我：柴塘完成後，要將前面傾圮的石塘拆毀，至今冬再修新的石塘。我們看見農胞們不論男女老小，都在挑泥作土塘和春木作柴塘，緊張萬分，我曾問一個春木的農胞！「你們每天可以得多少麵粉？」他說「九斤，折價只有三百多塊錢。」我又問善後救濟分署正督工的人，他說：「我們以工作效能計給麵粉，種一根木頭七斤，每人每天可做兩根木頭，計可得十四斤麵粉。」我們從石塘邊回來，看見一羣農胞正在工程午餐，吃的是米飯和一碟鹹菜。</p>
<p>新泥塘</p>
<p>到「營桓公國」字號塘，那裏新築的泥塘被冲毀了。再到接近海鹽方面底陳汶港的「迴漢惠」，「感武丁」，「多士寗晉楚」字號塘等處，有的遷在補修小部份尚未完工的泥塘。但據工程人員講：「泥塘僅能堵勢弱的潮，所以在泥塘前還須築一層柴塘，在柴塘前有石塘，那是更保險了。但現在要整修石塘，發展迅速不許可，惟有先把柴塘弄好。」但是現在大師的柴枝還沒有來，一堆堆極少的柴枝還不夠什麽用處。而七月十五眼見就要到了，我們江南的人民應該嚴密的注意這件事。</p>
<p>海鹽城</p>
<p>我們沒有到海鹽城，但巳在接近海鹽的地方，知道海鹽也遭敵毀壞，當地人民多半還是務農爲業，打魚者鹽也是他們的副業，乍浦平湖也是如此。我曾打聽當地很多有智識的人士，一致認爲海塘的重心確在海寗一帶，如果海寗一帶不保，則江南均將成爲澤國。於是我又將我認爲海寗該縣的理由請教他們，他們也認爲是絕對的理由。</p>
<p>車翻身</p>
<p>歸途中，我想本「江南富天下富」的意義，全國的人士都應該注意返海塘的重要。我們如何使海塘永不傾圮，確保江南的富庶，就應該把海寗縣政府搬回海寗來，從事於復興的建設。</p>
<p>返摋將及海寗七公里處，泥製的公路坍了，我們的車子也翻了身，我受些微傷到不要緊，卻把海塘搶修委會的總工程師馮旦弄傷了。</p>
<p>星期論壇</p>
<h3>救救農村！</h3>
<p>— 夏高波</p>
<p>一　我們自愧以農立國</p>
<p>我們是一向自稱以農立國的。</p>
<p>我國地處溫帶，寒暖適宜，黃河長江流域，一片肥沃土地，故最宜農桑。禹平水土，計墾田九萬萬餘畝，這時人中不過一千三百萬人，每人平均畝數幾達七十畝。孟子謂夏時一夫授田五十畝，當時是很可能的。時至今日，每人平均墾田畝數雖不如古代之多（後詳），但據一般統計，全國人口至少百分之七十五人口爲農夫，有說百分之八十五人口是農夫。）故「以農立國」這句話，似乎還沒有錯。</p>
<p>但是，假使我們把我國的「墾值指數」與「每人平均畝數」和世界各國一比較，真又覺得自「以農立國」了。「墾植指數」是巳墾植土地而積占全國而積的百分數，「每人平均畝數」是全國人口除全國墾植土地而積的平均數。我們試列表與各國加以比較：</p>
<p>（國別）　（墾植指數）　（每人平均畝數）</p>
<p>丹麥　六一、二%　一二、四畝</p>
<p>波蘭　四八、六%　一〇、〇畝</p>
<p>印度　四五、九%　八、一畝</p>
<p>德國　四三、七%　五、二畝</p>
<p>法國　四一、八%　九、〇畝</p>
<p>英國　二三、八%　二、〇畝</p>
<p>美國　一八、〇%　一九、三畝</p>
<p>加拿大　二、五%　四〇、〇畝</p>
<p>中國　一五、四%　三、四畝</p>
<p>我們自號以農立國，但是我們底墾植指數卻不及工業國家底指數遠甚。至於「每人平均畝數」除比較英國爲高外，其餘也就比不上了，但應知英國的人口密度也高於中國，每人平均畝數自然比較底了。我國地廣人稀，「每人平均畝數」如此低下，實出意外。</p>
<p>雙擾前農商部的調查，我國自一九一四年至一九一八年，荒田的增加，有如左表：</p>
<p>（年次）　（畝數）</p>
<p>一九一四　三五八，二二五、八六七畝</p>
<p>一九一五　四〇四，三六九、九四八畝</p>
<p>一九一六　三九〇，三六一、〇二一畝</p>
<p>一九一七　九二四，五八三、八九九畝</p>
<p>一七一八　八四八，九三五、七四八畝</p>
<p>以農立國自號的國家，荒田的數量在五年之中反而增加百分之一三六強。近幾年來雖還找不到精確的統計，但是連年戰爭，淪陷之地，農夫離鄉背井，敵人恣意刧掠，殺人放火，苛捐雜稅，荒田的有增不巳，自然也是意料中的事了。</p>
<p>這樣看來，難怪洋米的入超要與年俱增，而一旦洋米被陰運華，我們就要嚐到糧價暴漲的滋味了。我們實在自愧「以農立國」，惶恐萬分！</p>
<p>二　八年抗戰話農村</p>
<p>抗戰似乎刺戟着各方面進步，但對於農村，卻又好像是例外。農民是抗戰勝利的大功臣。主席於去年慶祝勝利典禮的廣播演詞中曾說：「在此抗戰的綿長歲月中，軍隊兵員的補充與國家戰費的負担，大部都落在農民的肩上。」抗戰是勝利了，農民卻反因此而將瀕於破産。</p>
<p>第一、苛雜如毛與荒田的增加　在抗戰期內，荒田逐年增加是無可否認的。戰爭兵燹，不能安居，物價上漲，成本浩大，當然影響到耕種。此外就收復區而言，淪陷期內，敵僞恣意剝削，除田賦之外，還有保甲捐，保衛捐，「獻」機捐，駐軍米貼，開拔費，慰勞費，「皇軍」招待費……五花八門，再加上「米糧統制」和強征軍米，迫使農民不願耕作。太湖一帶，産絲着名，在淪陷期內，因人工柴炭成本太貴，資金不足，都巳養不起蠶了。倒反把桑樹斬下變錢，吃掉。又竹林桑樹，敵人深恐伏兵難防，也有被斬光的。就自由區而言，抗戰期內，苛捐雜稅實也不少，各種公糧和軍政公款，層出不窮，征收軍米也往往抑價硬買。荒田自然增多。勝利以後，滿以爲必可松一口氣了，想不到苛雜如毛，並未改觀。據聞浙江上虞小越鄉鎮上的苛雜情形，那邊去年十二月份有　同盟勝利公債，　縣府特種專業費，　舊欠軍公食榖　鄉鎮經費公糧，　籌購軍糧，　本鎮購械基金，　中心國民學校基金，及　保隊附訓練及保內費用等項目，普通一戶要攤派國幣九七二元又白米一〇七斤；今年一月份有　卅二年度軍公食糧，　卅三年度鄉鎮級公糧，　第一期第一次復員經費，　征購蒿嵊公路木料差價，及　追加購槍費等項目，普通一戶要攤派國幣一四四〇元又白米一〇四斤；二月份有　購軍糧虧耗，　軍公倉榖，　鎮經費，　招待駐軍及　採購副食耗費等項目，普通一戶要攤派白米八十四斤（以上每戶攤派數是按戶口多少計算的）。三月四月，當然也有。此舉不過一例，各地類似情形卻也普遍。這樣繁多的項目和重大的負担，可憐的鄉下人那裏能忍受得了，但他們不僅不敢言而且不敢怒的。這真是一個嚴重的問題！</p>
<p>第二，肥料簡陋農具缺乏　在抗戰期內第二個嚴重問題是普遍的缺乏農具和肥料的粗劣。我國農村耕種方法千百年來毫無改進，所用肥料仍以豆餅，人糞，獸糞，溝泥，水草等爲主，戰起物價日漲，豆餅人糞巳非貧幾所能負担，獸糞以人工太貴，也不暇採集，所以一般農戶都必用泥溝水草。産量的銳減自屬當然。也有很多地方因此而改種雜糧蔬菜的。農具的缺乏，也是一個嚴重問題。擾經濟週報上洪平先生統計：「宜與方面，農家兩家半大約有一隻牛，今則五家難得一隻。皖南南陵，宣城，當塗，繁昌，涇縣一帶農村，戰前三四家有一隻牛，今則三四十家才有一隻。」（見經濟週報第一捲第八期）。這也是很普遍的一種現象。推其原因，一爲貧農無資購買；爲易被偷竊。至於其他梨，耙，水車，也因價格太貴，因陋就簡。加之人工又貴，耕作也就草率將事。勝利以後，百物都貴，瘋狂地上漲，那麽添置農具，自然又非其時了。</p>
<p>第三，主要家産逐年減退，劉大鈞先生從前曾調查編制「作物指數」（係　以一年中各種農作物所占田畝面積加得總數，而以農田總面積除之所得百分數），發現我國稻田面積有逐年減少之勢，證以戰前米糧入超的數字，也足扒想這種趨勢的可信。抗戰發生後，淪陷區和大後方都因爲農民游離，成本高的逐年減退，尤覺可處。淪陷區因敵人侵占，實施米糧統制和改種雜糧和菜蔬，浦東産花，也因限價統制的關係，種棉不如雜糧菜蔬爽快賺錢，所以産量也逐年減退。至於那裏的自由區均産量爲三百五十二斤，民國二十九年以後各年每畝平均産量減至二百六十五斤。棉花産量也因花絲市　的管制而減退，以産棉冠於全國的陝西而言民國二十四年的約産八十萬担，三十三年以後每年産量僅約三十餘萬担。勝利以後，雖然不再有統制，但其他許多原因並沒有解除，的資金問題更比以前嚴重，則今後主要農産的難望增加，恐非杞憂。</p>
<p>第四，儉樸之風無形消失　我國各地農民向來富有儉樸勤勞的美德。抗戰期內，物價日漲，維持生活保障財富，決非單純儉樸可以勝任，農民不善貨殖，初不料戰時經濟是如此這般，所以吃盡苦楚。幾年下來，靈巧的早改業「單幫」，或兼業「單幫」，笨漢死做，那就活該。加之離亂不安，苛雜如毛，幣值日跌，今日所蓄，不如昨日用掉，於是生活儘苦，而貨幣倒也不大重視，加之努力耕作既有困難，反使賭博閒蕩在皆是，穩健儉樸之風無形消失。不肖之徒，笠而走險，淪爲盜竊；無知之輩，易受煽惑，徒然被人利用。眼前環境未見好轉，勤勞儉樸之重振，此時恐怕還談不到。</p>
<p>抗戰是勝利了，農民卻也瀕於破産了。我們固然不配自號農業國，但百分之七十五以上是農民究竟是事實。農村　敗仍將是何等重大的一個問題！諺謂大兵之後必有凶年，俗語雖不可必信，但揚子江一帶，支冬氣候溫暖，未見降雪，內地也不寒冷。加之抗戰期內種種不利於農村的環境，又並不跟着勝利而完全解決，前途殊不許樂觀。這是實在的，農村不復興，經濟建設也就談不到，工業化國家更是夢想。我們於此，不得不提出這個緊迫的呼籲：救救農村！</p>
<p>三，發展農業信用刻不待緩</p>
<p>以遠大澈底的眼光看今日的中國農村問題，打開根本的症結，當然先要從解決土地問題着手。總理說：「我們要增加糧食的生産，便要規定法律，對於農民的的權利，有一種鼓勵，有一種保障，讓農民自己可以多得收成。我們要怎樣能夠保障農民的權利，要怎麽樣令農民自己才可以多得收成，那便是關於平均地權的問題。……農民問題真是完全解決，是要「耕着有其田」！」</p>
<p>但是，救急的辦法，作者個人底意見是：切切實實發展農業信用！</p>
<p>並不是說我國現在沒有農業信用，而是說中國現在沒有「切實的」農業信用。談過去，　我們底貸授農業信用者大都由於個人（農民的親友或地主），雖有典當，也盤剝太凶。　利率太高，所以農民借得款項，並非策劃未來發展之用，而純粹只是救急，甚至可說是救命，所以非到瀕於餓死，不肯輕易告貸。　借款方式大都爲抵押土地，而所借得款項又既非策劃未來發展之用，而爲救命之需，所以借後每難償還，易致土地由抵押而變爲賣絕，故農民不敢輕易嚐試。這種農業信用，我們不僅不敢提倡，並且希望早日消滅。</p>
<p>至於現代農業金融的方式，當以中國農民銀行爲中心。近年來中國農民銀行放棄商業金融，專心從事農貸，不可謂不努力，對於貸放工作，也不可謂不審慎，但是效率如何，我們實不敢隨口恭維。第一，中農的借款方式是間接的，根據該行緊急農貸辦法的規定，以合作社、農會、及其他農業團體爲對象，經他們的手再轉貸與農民；第二，縱然我們承認中農對於借款許多的審核相當嚴正，但是對於借款真正的運用情形卻不曾注意。我們就過去情形而言，過去辦理合作社的份子，高明的實在不很多，家會公所又大都是地痞劣紳所把住，有許多不肖之徒混跡其中，利用合作社家會公所，主宰農民，剝削農民。農貸借手此輩，怎麽會有良好效果！至於真正合作同志們爲主義爲國家發展合作副業的，不僅絕對少數，而且每多與農民隔閡，能夠深入農村的也苦實在不多，因此英雄無用武之地，農貸假手此輩書生，雖無害於農，卻也很少實益。這是過去辦理農貸挫敗的原因。</p>
<p>我政府近年來也洞悉此弊，所以對於合作副業蓄意整頓和推進，注意量的增加，同時也更注意質的提高。今後這一個農貸承轉機構想來一定可以改善許多，便利農民的關鍵實繋於此。聞上海市合作鎦不久快要成立，這是調節和滋長合作金融的一個機關，是合作社的中央銀行，我們實寄以的期望。</p>
<p>合作社承轉農貸工作，辦得好固然是很好，但可惜的是今日合作副業太不普遍，鄉間合作社實在太少，少數合作社實在還不能完成這個重大的使命。在這個清黃不接的當兒，中農本身既自覺還沒有深入農村，作者個人的意見，不妨同時酌量約請各鄉村郵匯局承轉貸放，以補目前的缺憾。</p>
<p>作者曾在前面各段敘述，關於我國農村的許多缺憾，其中最重要的是耕種訪求千百年毫無改進，換句話說，農具陳舊，肥料單純，技術不精，種籽不良。長此下去，茶葉蠶絲桐油什麽都不合出口標凖，米麥雜糧無一可以足敷國人需要，這是最危險的一件事。今日中農對於直接辦理農貸既無把握，間接辦理農貸又未見良好，而另一方面各地農民又岌岌待救，全國普遍的在鬧着饑荒，外滙的穩定又完全倚賴着農産品的大量出口，現值中美農業技術合作國美國專家來華之際，中農何不在改良農具種籽造肥料實驗種植這些方面而努力，以拯救水深火熱中的農民。</p>
<p>我國農民知識太低，財力太薄，農具肥料種籽技術，他們什麽都談不到改進，這個使命他們還不配擔負。由中農來發動這項任務，實在是最陽理想。我們不可期望得太高，不可立刻想做到農耕完全機械化，應該一步一步地根據現實改進。自己設廠製造肥料，把笨拙的木片水車利用槓杆原理改用鐵製，讓老牛也少化些力氣而反加速了水量的運轉，舉辦實驗農塲，改良種籽和䨟種方法。作者有位朋友是農業專家，他一家在浦東自己耕作，丟棄了西裝深入農村，他發現了附近農家種籽的不良，他發現了他們播種的浪廢和種籽發育的障碍，他發現了他們施肥的不得其時，他發現了他們蟲患的毫無辦法，他發現了他們忽略休閒期的利用於是他一件一件苦口婆心地教導他們，結果主宰了新方法確乎美滿，於是他們雋了。這些那些，作者認爲並不是一件難事，而效果是十分高的。假定以類似這一種輔導農耕的實驗農塲，普遍地深入農村，真與農民打與一片以後，並且可以藉此推進農貸，貸之以錢，授之以法，更租借農具給他們，照作者個人的看法，這才是真正有益於農村的救濟，這才是一種有補於國家的農貸。若如皮毛救濟的方法，硬發幾套西裝甚至口紅高跟鞋之類給鄉農鄉婦，可說是牛頭不對馬嘴，越救越糟糕的。各地農民確在水深火熱之中，他們需要救援，他們更需要這一種切切實實的救援！</p>

<h3>田太郎</h3>
<p>— 池沼</p>
<p>秋末，西風捲起校園裏枯葉，自從我到了這裏，天，老是這麽陰沉，下着不大不小的雨：斷續地，浙瀝地，像永遠不會有晴朗日子。</p>
<p>今夜我又給那歌聲吵醒了，雖然不懂得是唱些什麽，可是那種像悲壯又凄凉的音韻，總使我能領悟到歌者的心田。耳邊又是聽到滴滴的雨聲，更勾引起了我底思索。</p>
<p>我們學校是一座三層樓大洋房，有操塲·校園·淪陷時給日人佔作××館，勝利後我們收回了二樓一部分，其餘還住着待遣回國的日僑，他們有高級人物，有敎授，有學生，小商人等，多是屬於知識份子。學校爲恐日後會發生意外，先派我看管着校舍，自從我來了，就做了他們的主人。</p>
<p>他們對待我總表現着自卑，有禮·馴服的態度，和他們見面，談話，老是作九十度的鞠躬，可是他們這種沉默，堅忍，謙處的舉動，會使我感到疑惑，恐懼·尤其是，當我想到戰時日本兵給我底印象：四方形的冷面，東瓜梯的軀幹：和那笨鈍沉重的脚步聲，腦子裏便不期顯現着那猙獰的面目，粗野的行爲，慘痛的回憶，那時我眞像置身鬼域，所以起初我在睡覺時總把武器放在枕下，預防不測。</p>
<p>那種歌聲多是從三樓那角落發出的，我知道他們多喝了酒，半夜裏就會唱起來，每次把我吵醒了就引起我的不安，越想越怕，好幾次我壯着胆向他們吆喝，才寂靜了。今夜，我想讓他們天天這樣留下去，再不能了，我明天得和田太郎交涉，制止了他們的夜唱。</p>
<p>田太郎是那居留着學校內日人的領袖，聽說他從前是個重要人物，校舍裏每個敎室都住着好幾個日人，而他和他底婦人，獨佔着三樓上一個大房裏。他底婦人是個白俄，名字叫做「露茜娟子」。我想那多怪的日俄合璧的名字。</p>
<p>田太郎有着一般日人矮胖身體，有一雙黑溜溜的眼睛，唇上長着仁丹鬍子，面部沒有什麽表情，笑起來也像是勉强的，年紀四十歲左右，他會說英語，北京話和上海話。他也喜歡喝酒，喝了就睡，橫倒在「達達米」上，像個糊塗人，可是同居的日僑見了他，就鞠躬，請安，每日如此。「醉唱」在他是沒有的。</p>
<p>他有時召集同住日僑，或學生羣舉行什麼集會，看他們的樣子都像是很尊重的，我雖不懂日語，但他們那種沉思緊張的情形，和田太郎憤激顫動的語氣，總使我感到疑懼，可是他們家家都掛有中國國旗，有些並懸有蔣委員長的肖像。</p>
<p>住在二層樓的學生，整天都在靜默地看着書本，田太郎或其他像敎授樣的人物，喝醉了，有時就拿着他們其中的出氣，而那些學生總像受着嚴重的敎訓，他們說一句，那學生就鞠躬應着：「係」（是），不敢回駁一撀，有時甚至扯他的頭髪，搖他的肩膀，也沒有反抗，眞使我覺得不可思議。</p>
<p>我對日人沒有好感，我更應次逼他們遷移，爲了田太郎是他們的負責人，所以和他接觸的機會更多，他對我總這樣謙恭·下氣·沒表情的面露着笑容，往往使我發不出火氣來。然而，他在日僑的面前，却是高倨而嚴肅的。</p>
<p>他曾說是爲了我一個人寂寞，有時請我到他樓上喝酒，起初我拒絕他幾次，後來經不了他幾次幾度的鞠躬，於是我們由喝酒的起點而漸漸地混熟起來，使我對他們的疑懼和憎恨也隨着消失了。</p>
<p>我們在閒談裏，我每想探知田太郎對此次戰事的觀感，他總是溜着黑眼睛，扯到別處去。我又問他對我國前途的展望，他往往也是把眼瞧着窗外看——窗外正是陰沉下着雨，有一次，我問得緊了，他才强笑說：「貴方，上海人士，戰時稱呼我們東洋先生，現在却呌東洋赤佬，以後，唔…」他停頓一下，「以後不知將怎樣稱呼我們，」他的話眞使我有點刺耳。</p>
<p>記得有一次，來了×部隊的一個長官，想用校舍駐紮部隊，要把他們趕走，急得田太郎來找我，我爲了此來的目的和學校的主權，便挺身出來和那位長官折衝，結果，因事理俱在，而那位長官又是同鄕人，才打銷了本意，但臨走時却駛去他們××館的汽車，他又來請求我幫忙，我明知交涉是多此一舉，拒絕了他。他才像憤慨地說：「貴國，還是那樣！」不知他是否自悔失言，隨後又改了臉有禮地和我混談起來，眞使我摸不着他的心理。</p>
<p>田太郎，在我底眼目中，他就是這樣的一個人物！</p>
<p>第二天，起來，天還是沒有晴意。我趁空跑上田太郎房裏，想和他交涉昨晚的事。他房裏顯得特別沈靜，露茜娟子也寂然地屈膝坐着，見了我點點頭，田太郎却露出那沒有表情的「笑面」來招呼我：</p>
<p>「啊揩喲，（早安）×樣（先生）請坐。」</p>
<p>我搭訕着，告訴了他的來意，他嚴肅地說：</p>
<p>「×樣，對·對·我就制止他們，可是，他們也是悶不過才唱出來。」他的眼睛溜了一下又說：「可是，命令已下來了，我們這一批明後天就遣送回國去。」他說完遞了口捲烟給我，自己也劃了火狂吸着，室裏頓時沉默起來，露茜娟子更像呆了的，我覺得空氣太沉悶了，辭了出來，臨走時，田太郎却打破沉默說：</p>
<p>「×樣，今晚，請你來喝酒，要賞光！」</p>
<p>從田太郎那裏喝了酒，走回自己室裏，夜雨淅瀝地下着，我想到剛才的情景，心裏有點惘然，待我收拾好將要睡下，忽聽到叩門的聲音。</p>
<p>開了門，不料閃進來的都是露茜娟子，提着個手提箱，她紅着眼圈用英語向我說：</p>
<p>「蜜司脫×，田太郎要趕走我，說他不能帶我回國去，他雖然把所有的首飾和鈔票都給了我，但我總捨不得離開他，而且我能到那裏去，蜜司脫×你替我說說去，謝謝你」，說完，她用手帕拭着臉。</p>
<p>我同情了她，我走出房去，外間的一切都是寗靜的，其他的日人，像沒有受到這一件事的影響。走到田太郎的住所，房門鎖着，我叩門，起初沒有聲音，叩得緊了，才聽到田太郎的回答說：</p>
<p>「×樣，這是我國家和自己的事，我不能帶娟子回去，請你別管我們的事。」</p>
<p>以後，在房外任我怎樣的說，也沒有回答，我走下來，只用着抱歉的態度來告訴露茜娟子，她只有嘆氣，我們只沉默起來。</p>
<p>「他就是這種脾氣，做事是堅決而倔强的，我也知道他不是不愛，我，可是，下着雨，呌我黑夜裏到那裏去？」她開始說，「蜜司脫×，你房裏能够讓我過一夜嗎？」</p>
<p>我爲了恐怕發生意外；只好婉轉地拒絕她。</p>
<p>「那末，蜜司脫×，請你和我呌一部黃包車好嗎？謝謝你」，她便轉念說。</p>
<p>我答應了她，披起雨衣，拿着手提箱和她走出校外。</p>
<p>「蜜色司田，你呌車子上那兒去？」我問。</p>
<p>「呵：這個……」露茜娟子茫然地，「我也沒有目的，讓我在車上想想好了，只請你和我呌部車子，謝謝你。」</p>
<p>車來了，她坐上去，我把皮箱給她，她握着我底手，使我不由沈默起來。</p>
<p>「蜜司脫×，再會，多謝你」，說着，她指揮車夫向前走。</p>
<p>雨點飄到臉上，我才驚覺過來，她的車也走遠了，寂然地走回校裏，一切還是寗靜的。</p>
<p>第三夭早上，雨還是下着，那些日僑正在收拾行李，我曾走去過探視田太郎，房門虛掩着，他還是倒睡在「達達米」上，室裏是紛亂的，我不便驚醒他，走了下來。</p>
<p>下午，當他們起程到集中地點的時候，田太郎像特意來看我，沉着臉沒有往日的笑容。</p>
<p>「×探，謝謝你晚的好意，我不是想拋棄娟子，可是我又不能帶她回國去，而且我把所有的都給了她了」，他的黑眼溜了一下，「×樣，你在這裏，你總有機會會碰到她，你代我對她說…」他興奮地急急地說下去「再過幾年，我一定會回到貴國來找她的」。</p>
<p>聽了田太郎的話，不禁使我怔往了，我感到受了無限的譏刺，日人給我的壞印象又浮現在腦際，我正待發作。</p>
<p>「莎喲娜娜」（再會），田太郎像幷不理會我的態度，昻然走了出去，也沒有向我鞠躬，一反平月的樣子。</p>
<p>我不由惱怒起來，可是我望着天，還是那麽陰沉的樣子，雨，時斷時續地下着，像不會有晴朗的日子，不覺把怒氣消失了一半。我再望向窗外，在微雨中，田太郎率領着的一羣正秩序井然地向目的地進前，沒有紛亂，更沒有悲戚。使我腦子裏子又掀起那：「四方形的冷面，東瓜樣的軀幹，笨鈍沉重的脚步聲…」底印象，不禁又感到疑懼與徬徨。</p>
<p>然而，天還是陰沉的，雨還是斷續下着，天陰了這麽久，雨下了許多天，眞使人鬱悶極了。</p>
<p>「明天，明天該放晴了吧！」我默禱着。</p>
<h3>夏夜</h3>
<p>— 鳴奕</p>
<p>假使夏是一篇散文，夏夜就應該是一首詩。每一個夜晚就是一首不同的小小的詩：抒情的，叙事的，說理的……</p>
<p>那時候，白天裏炎帝留下的毒焰，已經被晚風驅走，人聲漸漸消沉下去，月兒慢慢上來，你或則是獨個兒仰臥在遼闊的草地上，下意識地數着鑲嵌在天幕上的一顆兩顆……星星，緬想着童年時的過去。</p>
<p>或則你竟有那麽好的幸運，能有個膩友在一起。你們肩相並手相携，緩緩地在那挺直的兩旁長滿了梧桐的大道上，緩緩走着，喁喁傾訴着願望。黯淡的路燈從不會來訕笑你倆的痴情。面前的道路是走不完的平坦，遙長。</p>
<p>或許你們這時寂寂地坐在夜花園的一角，默無一言，Shubert的小夜曲輕輕在從遠處飄來，使你想起了這樣一位靑年音樂家的身世，惋惜着他的第八交響曲終於未能完成。或者當你默誦着杜牧的「天階夜色凉如水，臥看牽牛織女星」的時候，回首問你的年輕的朋友說：「知道那一顆是織女麼？」她搖搖頭，於是你們相顧而笑。</p>
<p>這時，你當然不會愛聽那一曲悱惻凄怨的「別離圓舞曲」，但是它的委婉纒綿的旋律畢竟牽動了平靜的心，你說：「我們舞吧」？—翩翩起舞的時候，你也似乎已是個即將遠赴邊戍的離人，依依惜別，你迥旋着，迴旋着迴旋着……於是，夏夜的暑意在不盡低徊中消逝，像小貓　着脚趾一般不知不覺地消逝，待她低低說一聲「回去吧？」四圍人已散得差不多了。你整了整微沾着些兒露珠的衣襟，站了起來。落月已西沉，星星也倦乏地脥着睡限，漆黑的夜幕將陰森森的樹林子裹得更緊了。</p>

<h3>雙宿雙飛（九八）</h3>
<p>— 趙清閣</p>
<p>董劭凌也笑了，揑了揑麗華的鼻子說：</p>
<p>「對！我就喜歡常常看見你這微笑。」</p>
<p>麗華拿起黃劭凌的左手，看了看鑲的時計。連忙拭拭眼淚說：</p>
<p>「時候不早了，我該回去了。」說罷緊握了握他的手。並深情地看了他一眼。</p>
<p>「我明天到車站送你們去。」董劭凌送着她說。</p>
<p>「謝謝您！」麗華依然微笑地點了點頭。</p>
<p>董劭凌目送麗華去遠了，不禁有些迷茫。回到屋裏，他反覆琢磨着麗華剛才的一舉一動，覺得都彷彿弦外有音，然而又是那麽模糊的印象。於是他不禁自言自語地打趣着自己說：「一個常年生活在「戲」的人，就是這樣纒綿悱惻慣了的，還是別自作多情了吧！」董劭凌自己笑了，他幌幌腦袋，把煩亂的思緒，幌開了。依舊又寗靜地拿起了書來。</p>
<p>麗華低着頭，載着沉重的心情蹣跚地走出黃大王廟門外，走出當年飛揚着黃砂的開封！她曾一再依依地回顧！回顧那蜿蜓古老的城垜；回顧那巍然聳立的鐵塔；回顧那莊嚴方正的鼓樓；回顧那破爛失修的黃大王廟；回顧那終日伏在案頭，瀟洒而又書迂；熱情面又漠然的董劭凌……</p>
<p>〔雙宿雙飛〕：上部結束</p>
<p>「雙宿雙飛」在執筆之初，原想着「飛」個十萬字就可以「宿」，孰料寫到如今十萬字已經飛過去了，而故事的本身才只走了一半路程，下一半的路程又是相當的崎嶇，因此我估計勢必還得十萬字始能宿下來。這是我絕沒有想到的，因爲我對於文藝事業，祗是一個希望表現一點良心的本分工作者，我沒有任何大的企圖或野心！我從不敢亦不曾事先有什麼狂妄的幾十萬字幾十萬字的計劃，而這一次我竟無意地把自己的肩上負担了廿萬字的重荷，弄得「騎虎難下」。不寫下去吧，可惜了的！寫下去吧，眞有點畏縮！不管怎樣，第一步我得把連載告一個段落。不連載了，我或則還可以從容地寫下去。連載着，我的筆有些感到被生活鞭策的不自然的苦楚，心情也不如爲文藝而文藝的愉快，輕鬆。所以，我決定咬咬牙，放棄這點有限的稿費收入，截至現在止，作爲小說的上部結束了，下部不再發表！</p>
<p>「雙宿雙飛」是我預備從民國建立到抗戰勝利，描寫幾個大時代變遷中的種種社會現象的一部長而複雜的小說。三十五年的演義，自然不是三言兩語所能寫盡的，然而我已經盡量地簡單化了！我不敢說我一定可以寫好這個可歌可泣的故事，我敢說我是忠寶地，樸素地本着我的良心寫的！</p>

<h3>影劇批評人的智識和道德</h3>
<p>— 陶熊</p>
<p>劇評人和影評人是舞台和銀幕與觀衆之間的橋樑，也是觀衆的一雙說利眼睛，更是舞台和銀幕前的法官！你想：他們是負有多麽重大的責任！</p>
<p>劇評人不能隨時隨地寫出阿立斯多德說：「如何如何」；影評人也不可每評即「蒙太奇」如何；因爲你要知道，你寫的批評文字不是專給內行看的，它是呈獻在無數讀者之前，而這無數可敬的讀者是不十分瞭解術語的。他們不需要知道什麼阿立斯多德和蒙太奇；他們只需要知道好在那裏和壞在那裏的種種就够了。</p>
<p>我們時常看到批許文字責難影劇的表演現目的。甚至絕對主觀地指出應該如何如何才對。還是不對的。一個批評者只是公正的批評，不是修改。同時他自己得知道，他所用的批評尺度是否是適合這劇影所表現的東西。假使人家是米，而你用尺去量是量不出結果；若是人家是布，你用升斗去量也同樣的量不出結果；你必須用升斗量米，用尺量布，才能得到正確的結論。批評者也一定要站在編劇，導演，演員和一切技術人員的立塲去批評，從他們所要表現的目的中去發現不足和錯說，也把他們完美的東西指出並告訴觀衆。</p>
<p>曾經看到很多批評演員的文字，只說：「某人演得很好」，「某人演得不好」；可是，這好與不好的標準在那裏呢？不得而知。最好是能够舉出他們的優點和劣點的例子來，使別人看了一目了然，這才能使批評文字生効，不致於浪費筆墨！</p>
<p>劇評人和影評人對於劇影的智識必須豐富；他們要有高人一等的獨到見解。因爲他們的責任是指出影劇中的優點和劣點，具體的和抽象的部份，把觀衆所看不到的優點告訴觀衆，把劇中未被表現出的一部份指出來告訴這些藝術工作者，使他們有改善的機會。</p>
<p>劇許人和影評人必須有高尚的道德和客觀的態度。記得在民國三十年，江西有一位批評家批評舞合上的演員說：「最好多吃些阿四匹靈再演」。這，未免太主觀過份了。若是批評家因爲和這位演員有私恨，借此機會一洩胸中悶氣，那麽，這位批評家就沒有資格當批評家，因爲他沒有道德。爲了當一個批許者必須和法官一樣，要有公正和嚴肅的態度才配！</p>
<p>批評者是一匹識途的老馬，他得把觀衆領入正路；假使批評者是瞎寫，那麼，他就會把觀衆領入歧途了。我們總不能讓觀衆來領導批評者啊！</p>
<h3>舞臺技術講話　（九）附授色感的諸論</h3>
<p>— 文泉</p>
<p>晚近學者對於色彩感覺之解釋，頗爲意見分歧。如耶恩，海姆訶支，及馬克斯威，皆主三原色感覺論。海林（Hering）則主三對視質論。文德則又全部否認，別立階段的理論。</p>
<p>三原色感覺論起源較早。西紀千八百〇二年，耶恩由色光混合之實騐改正舊傳赤黃靑之原色之說，以爲色光原色乃赤綠紫之三種。其假設之根據乃在人目網膜上分布三種神經末梢，外來色光使第一種末梢生興奮時，則生赤色感覺，第二生綠覺，第三生紫覺；三者同時興奮，則生白覺。又或其間兩種或三種同時興奮，而其程度有差異時，則生其他一切混色之感覺。後千八百六十八年，海姆訶支修正其說，以爲三種神經末梢，各有各種色覺，不過對於某種色光之興奮較甚，非毫無其他色光之感。至所謂之原色，仍屬赤綠紫。後馬克斯威更用精密之實騐方法，證明之原色感覺之可信，但第三種原色，則是靑，而非紫。現今主三原色者，多從此說。</p>
<p>千八百七十八年海林復有新說發表。其說略謂人目網膜之神經末梢由種種視質構成。其類別有三對。對於外來各種光線之刺激，或起生理學上之異化作用（即破壞或消耗之作用），或起同化作用（即構成或補結之作用），逐有各種之色覺。其略如表：</p>
<p>視質　同化作用　興化作用</p>
<p>第一黑白視質　黒覺　白覺</p>
<p>第二赤緣視質　（青綠）覺　赤覺</p>
<p>第三黃青視質　青覺　黃覺</p>
<p>以上六種以外之色覺，即由六種之共同作用得之，但無論何種色覺同時皆對第一視質行異化作用，故多少有白光感覺。如第二三視覺同異化之作用並起且甚平衡，則色感相消，惟餘第一視質之異化作用，故覺爲白或灰。（灰乃第一視質同異化作用並起之感覺也。）此說最足解釋補色混合之現象，又能解釋殘感之現象，（此即一種視質有一方面之作用後，必起對方作用而回復之，故有殘感。）以是信此說較多。</p>
<p>（一）一切之神經質皆有興奮與抑制之兩種過程。網膜在行抑制之時，則起黑色之感覺，此因與外來一部光之刺激相結合，而有種種明暗感覺。迨其刺激旣去，則仍繼續抑制而感其黑暗。</p>
<p>（二）綱膜受光之刺激，有無色之興奮而外，並有色彩之興奮。此則以光之波長變化其色調又以光之振幅變化其飽和。無色興奮旣與光之振幅有關，故各種色彩感覺中皆得有光度之差異。</p>
<p>（三）色彩興奮之過程，乃成至於多數光化學的過程之中。此種過程與波長俱爲階段的變化，並有循環進行之傾向。蓋光波波長相近者，由其刺激所生之化學作用相化，波長相異，則兩者作用亦漸違，至於補色關系時，兩者作用相反而相殺，逾此界限，則兩者作用又漸相近。無色感覺之過程同於此例，但波長之變化僅</p>
<p>使其强弱不同，而成直線之變化耳。</p>
<p>（四）每一種光之刺激，皆有光色及無色興奮相並而起。在光線極弱時，無色之感覺佔優勢，故見爲灰色。光線强度在中庸時，色彩感覺優勝，乃見飽和之各色。及光線過强，無色感覺又佔優勝，逐覺帶白云。</p>
<p>（五）各種光化學的興奮於其刺激旣去之後，仍暫時繼續不歇，而生積極的同色殘象。如刺激過甚，視覺疲勞之後，則生消極的補色殘象。有時回復疲勞而興奮，屢屢反復，而有律動的餘　。</p>
<p>（六）光線刺激之後曾，無色興奮較速而先起，其减退亦較先。故每種色感經時稍久，遂有殘象之色彩的餘韻。</p>
<p>色彩感覺之現象，由文德之說，大抵可以得其解釋。文德更認爲一切感覺，皆同時有其感情。視覺待化學變化爲媒介，能起極繁雜的感情，非通常之快不快感可以相槪。（完）</p>
<h3>封面女郎：麗泰海華絲　最大消費是製新裝不懂家務喜歡跳舞</h3>
<p>— 新方</p>
<p>「封面女郎」主角麗泰海華絲，近幾年來誠有直步雲霄之運，自完成「封面女郎」後，又擔任演出「姬黛」等名片，自成一派，其聲響在好萊塢實可蓋罩昔日之嘉　，今日之蒙丹；下面是一位美國記者新近訪問麗泰海華絲的一段談話，由此我們知道一些她銀幕下生活的情形，或者更可以因此而對於一般好萊塢藝人獲得了較深的認識。</p>
<p>問：當你在不拍戲的時候，你大槪在何時起身的？</p>
<p>答：我在不拍戲的時候，常常會睡到中午才起身的。我自己斷不承認貪睡；因爲一年中拍戲的時間佔大部份，而拍戲時早晨五時起身是極普通的。</p>
<p>問：做一個電影明星最大的消費是什麽？</p>
<p>答：是服裝的費用。不論我參加一次播音，或一次義演，我感到穿一件新裝是最必需的。一個電影明星應該像一個電影明星，普通的民衆是這樣希望，而我們亦祇有依着這樣做。</p>
<p>問：從影以來，你曾灰心過嗎？</p>
<p>答：一個人是免不了會遇到灰心的時候的。九年前我被派主演「　夢娜」時，因爲當時我在好萊塢的聲譽不及洛麗泰揚，所以我被踢出了；爲這件事我簡直要哭呢！</p>
<p>問：在公共塲所，你會怕羞嗎？</p>
<p>答：在週圍的人，如果但認我是一個普通人，那麽一切是極平淡的。但是當有游手好閒之徒，我一舉一動都要他們操心。我還是一個廿八歲的少女，涉世未深，在這種情形下，我天然的怕羞心理就常會形於面上的。</p>
<p>問：那一次的演出，你認爲最失敗？</p>
<p>答：在「紐約奇譚」中演那個不貞的夫人是最失敗的一次。這個角色無論在年齡上，儀態上好像都與我不適合，因此失敗是意料中的：</p>
<p>問：你對於處理一切家務，有什麼經騐？</p>
<p>答：我在極小的時候就開始學習跳舞，十六歲起就踏上銀壇，所以我可以說對於一切家務簡直不曾學習過；現在在演技方面或者比較進步了，但是對於一個普通家婦工作，我實在是很羨慕的！</p>
<h3>談：舞</h3>
<p>— 錢宗廉</p>
<p>中國的舞蹈是象徵佛的，歐美的舞蹈是象徵神的。各民族間舞蹈的性質和形式的不同，也就是他們模倣的對象不同。後來因爲社會的進步和人民的需要，所以舞蹈的性質和形式也就有了改變。到現在爲止，歐美的舞蹈大致分成了兩類：一類是屬於舞台舞（Stake　Dance）、一類是馬於舞廳舞（Ball　Room　Dance），舞台舞是專門表演的，我國有吳曉邦·戴愛　·及吳氏之四大女弟子等人。廳舞是用於交際的，也可稱爲交際舞，新類很多，除　團舞（Party　Dance）外，大多數是男女二人合舞。</p>
<p>歐美各國，社交公開，以舞藝爲交際和宴會的禮節。例如：英國中上社會的女子，到了及筓之年，他們的家長要替他們舉行一個跳舞會，邀請親友和社會知名仕女參加，籍此介紹他們的女孩子走進社會，開始交際。此外如歐美人仕，如遇宴會酬酢之時，常常舉行跳舞會以助餘與聯歡來賓，敦促友誼。所以他們把舞藝看得極其高尚，極其尊貴！</p>
<p>現時的舞廳舞，大概分二種方式：一種是自由式，一種是標準式。前者是不拘形式，不論姿勢，祇須有活潑的動作，輕靈的步法，舞得純熟就可。後者是講求姿勢，步法，方向，一切都須合乎規則。</p>
<p>標準式的交際舞，是英國舞藝專家會同審定的。他們對於姿勢，持握，步法，方向，扭身動作，傾斜動作和升降動作，以及音節的配合，都有一定的方式和合理的規定。</p>
<p>一般常去舞廳的人，大多數是不依規矩，不按音節，胡亂跳動而已。爲了這樣，跳自由式的人要佔據大多數。這多數人還不能跳到合乎自由式的程度。我們雖然不能批評得十分嚴格，但是，凡事不依規矩，不能成方圓。假使說不按音節而跳，那末音樂有什麽用？不依步法而亂跳，舞藝的意義何在？就是舞自由式，也必須要按音節，照步法才對，否則，就不該進舞廳，舞廳就該査封！因爲他不是高尚的交際所在，而是下流的匯集之處！使純潔良善的靑年男女走向歧路！</p>
<p>筆者極希望能够以關揚藝術的本意來提倡。同時，希望眞正愛好舞藝的人仕，必須要以藝術的心理來提高我國舞藝的水準！勿使它流於低級。</p>
<h3>「遙遠的愛」工作時之編導陳鯉庭（中坐者）女主角秦怡攝影師　關蔚雲（在開拉末旁）</h3>
<h3>演技中的形式派（續）</h3>
<p>— 葉子</p>
<p>對於觀衆的呈訴，是直接的，同時又是間接的；他坦白地把觀衆作爲觀衆，同時把他們作爲戲劇的一種活力，這戲劇是要被整個的劇塲，舞台，座客席共同來創造的。</p>
<p>以更尖銳而更生動的打擊，將人民的經歷，轉而給予人民，在那種時候，生活與劇塲，便溶爲一體，觀衆便是演員，那是他們自己的戲劇。</p>
<p>從一九二一年的「天明」演出為始，是以構成主義，動力的動力作，與單純化的運動爲特徵的。這二者的應用，表明梅伊荷總是繼續從事於抽象化的構成主義，抽象化的佈景，實際上，在革命以前便已經試過了。</p>
<p>構成主義有許多批評家認爲它是企圖以佈景形式表現機械時代·這，部份的說來，也許有理。</p>
<p>構成主義者尋求不同的金屬木材，玻璃藉新用法，用以表現它的用途的形式表達出來，這一些原素，是在俄國劇塲從未用過的。梅氏很看重某種原料所能產生情緒的效果，最初在許多戲的佈景中的平台與跑道，多半是木料竹料建成的。</p>
<p>以抽象節奏運用有力的運動來誘發情緒，傳達意念，是向藝術一樣古老的。戲劇起原的原始舞蹈與祭典，其中動作是象徵的，可是其呈訴於觀衆却是直接的，便是根據於此。機械動力，便是部分的回復到那種藝術中，却加以從泰勒主義所推演的現代解釋，以及帕夫洛夫的反應動作原理來改良，以動作的心理與神經的原動力代替情緒的原動力，這種企圖，在劇塲中可以說是新東西。藝術劇院的演員曾說過：「我作出這些動作，因爲我的情感迫使我如此。」機械的動作演員却說：「我作出這些動作，是因爲我知道作了它我所要作的能容易的直接的作出來」。</p>
<p>實習這種運動的理論，使人能明瞭，他的特性，單純化，撇棄他所認爲情緒控制的運動中的複雜性，最後他只需要與傳統的表現情緒的動作無關的「純粹動作」。這完全是合於心理的與生理的。當一個人刺痛了手指，或坐在釘子上，他跳起來，這不是因爲情緒所控制的這僅僅是神經的反應，沒有別的，老虎跳躍，並不是對於它情緒的答覆，而是它本能的知道，它的跳躍能立即獲得所要獵取的東西，觀察這種事實與行爲，使梅耶荷德發現了新的體系。</p>
<p>這種理論，獲得了藝術中的抽象的馬克斯理論。—以心理的功能的實行的創造，代替情緒的直覺的方法。就因爲這一點，使梅耶荷德近乎爲革命領袖。（未完）</p>

<h3>法理與人情</h3>
<p>— 少夫</p>
<p>親戚家兩個孩子，同在小學讀書，這小學素以「歷史悠久」「聲響卓著」見稱，學生家長無不以本人兒女能在該校就讀為榮。最近春季始業結束，秋季始業行將開始，舊生繼續就學，例須註册繳費，該校曾發通知，規定各費須於昨日繳淸。敝戚由於公私事務太忙，偶不經心，竟把這重要日子輕輕忘掉。及待想起，已經隔了一晚，第二天一早，匆匆趕往補辦繳費手續，不料學校方面竟說：你們延期不繳費，顯係無意繼續求學，同時本校已經招收新生補充，現在只能額滿見遺。</p>
<p>事實上，今天要求補辦繳費手續的，除了敝戚之外尚有多人，多數都是爲了昨天凑不齊款子直到今天凑足了數目而來繳的，可是學校辦事人，不問你是「無意遺忘」也好「籌款不及」也好，一槪把你當作「有意輟學』一律不予「通融」，當你費了許多口舌甚至於連「請你帮帮忙」之類的話也說出來時，他給你的最後一句答覆是「學校多着，你們換一家好了！」</p>
<p>聽聽看，這輕輕一句，裏面包藏着多少驕傲，輕蔑，與幸災樂禍！</p>
<p>誠然，繳費日期，學校自可自由規定，但俗語說「法無可恕，情有可原』國家法律，尚須以無背人情爲原則，何况校規，又何况一家學校所自由規定的繳費日期。學校可以規定那一天必須繳費，可是這規定也不可以遠反人情，第一不應該把截止期定得那麽早，第二不應該以犧牲兒童就學機會作懲處。現在爲了遲一晚繳費而拒絕學生入學，我認爲就是遠反人情！</p>
<p>然而我終於找到了該校所以如此做法的理由：原來一個舊生費用只收一萬多，而一個新生，把許許多多名目的費用加在一起，可以收到五六萬元之鉅。</p>
<h3>沒有動機的謀殺案　精神病的犯罪者在美國</h3>
<p>芝加哥的布朗公寓中，有一個女人在浴間裏給謀殺了。兇手用口紅在牆壁上留了字：「看在上天的面上，快逮住我吧，免得我再殺害人！我控制不住自己！」。</p>
<p>據驚局方面的推斷。這是一樁沒有動機的謀殺案。</p>
<p>芝加哥警局的檔案中，另外還有兩件可怖的謀殺案：有一個着黑色皮大衣的中年女子走進旅館裏一位五十五歲貴婦的房間內。開槍將她打死了。室內有價値三萬五千元美金的皮貨，絲亳未動。這也是一樁沒有動機的謀殺案。</p>
<p>物價管理局中有一位官員，六歲的女兒給綁去謀殺了。警局方面認爲，這個小女孩給綁去以後，立刻就給分割掉四肢。假使是爲了勒索，決不會這樣快撕票的。那末，這小女孩又是爲了甚麼被害呢？</p>
<p>這些罪案，全是精神病患者的傑作，美國社會，日益感覺到精神病患者的威脅。</p>
<p>一位著名的罪犯學家說：「也許這些兇手中，一個就是你的鄰居。有一個是侍候你吃飯的侍者，或是那車行里的夥計，或是鷄尾酒會中的那個漂亮女人。</p>
<h3>二百萬人患精神病</h3>
<p>精神病已經是一個普遍嚴重的問題。杜魯門總統最近在國會中發表：「美國至少有二百萬人患精神病；至少有一千萬人，在他們的一生中，有一倘時期需要住在醫院中，治療精神病」</p>
<p>假使精神病患者，得到適當的照顧與治療，至少有百分之五十的人，能够在十八個月中療愈出院。如果聽其自然，那末，這個人也許要終其一生，住在瘋人院裏。</p>
<p>美國的法官和醫師，一致公認，應該在法庭和監獄中，全面展開「抗精神病運動」。小小的疏忽，或竟付出極大的代價。</p>
<p>例如，在某大城市中，有一個年約四十歲的百貨公司的店員，在街上釘了一個女子，跟着她跑了好幾條街，她覺得討厭，就報吿了街角上的警察。</p>
<p>法官判了他十塊錢的罰金，並且說：「我不希望再在法庭上見到你。」</p>
<p>過了兩個星期，這一個店員，謀殺兩位警官。</p>
<p>據一位精神病學專家的報吿，「這個人有嚴重的精神病。許久以來，他就感到自己是被迫害着。當他被罰了十塊錢之後，他把所有的怨恨都集中在警察身上。他弄到了一把手槍，一遇到了機會，他就打死了兩個警官。」</p>
<p>這個店員的精神病，已經有了一個時期了，他的哥哥知道，他的房東知道，所有的人都知道，只有法院上的人不知道。而他們發現的時候，已經是太遲了。</p>
<p>這一類的例子是很多的，有一個年僅二十四歲的犯人被捕十八次，每次都放出去，最後終以殺人聞，假使在任何一次，能够注意一下他的精神狀態或許就不致發生這種悲劇了吧！</p>
<p>防止犯罪，對抗精神病，是一件迫切，而極有意義的工作。</p>
<h3>學府瑣事</h3>
<p>— 辛耘</p>
<p>有人說：大，中，小學內學生用錢的方法都各異。小學生一得了錢，就全費在零食上。中學生除費在零食上外，還費在看戲上。大學生却完全不同，他們得了錢都儲藏起來，以備和愛人出去的時候花。</p>
<p>走進小學的敎室內，滿耳都是打鬧的聲音。走進中學的敎室內，却只見粉筆頭亂飛，中間夾雜着歌聲。再走進大學的敎室內，却是滿耳的高談闊論，包括政治，新聞，戀愛等。</p>
<p>學校內的敎師，因爲敎書收入菲薄，三餐尚不能溫飽，所以一有他職，就辭去敎職。因此有少數學校課程表上，每星期有三十餘課，而實際上　却只有二十多課·無怪本應學期敎完的一本書，　學期終了時，却只教了三分之一或四分之一等。</p>
<p>高中有商科的學校，那學生就苦了。沒有問定敎室，一忽兒第幾敎室、一忽兒又第幾敎室。並且在中間的空課非常多、在這空課中要叫學生預備功課，那是不可能的事。並且大多數沒有空敎室。所以都是閒閒的玩過，在學問進步方面，效李自屬减少了。</p>
<p>有膳宿的學校，在他們吃飯的時候，你如果去參觀，一定能使你感歎。因爲差不多的學校，飯碗都是自備，那你就能看見有的用嗽口的杯子吃，有的用飯碗，有的甚至用鋼　的飯匣子，眞可謂包羅萬象。</p>
<h3>買舊貨須有訣巧貪便宜也要分寸</h3>
<p>— 祚祈</p>
<p>走完了卡德路，經麥根路向西折入武定路後，就到達與平濟利路齊名的舊貨市塲了。</p>
<p>武定路上舊貨攤的集合，大約遠在太平洋戰爭以前，因爲逃難的人太多，舊貨攤便與日俱增了。他們從市區各個角落收買了舊貨，晚上就聚集到這裏來作最後的一次交易，然後帶着一天的收獲回家去。武定路上本有幾爿收買舊銅爛鐵和料瓶廢紙的商店，在這種互惠的情形下、更增開了幾家，舊貨攤也愈加滙集到這裏來了。</p>
<p>慢慢地，一部分舊貨攤就終日擺設在這裏，生意也很不錯；因爲這裏是從熱閙區到滬西工廠區的通道，熙攘往來的大都是工友和小職員們。舊貨攤旣得天時，又得地利，人和之便，就很快地形成一種舊貨市塲了。以後，買賣的東西也漸形增多，如男女衣服，傢具木器，廚房用品，鐘表飾物等，簡直像走進百貨公司一樣。他們又很會適應買客的需要，像熱天的時候，就賣蚊帳和太陽眼鏡之類物品，天冷了，就賣棉花胎，湯婆子，脚爐等東西，一到農曆新年，各攤上又平添許多暖鍋，燭臺等。最近，他們也賣DDT藥水和噴射器等來配合顧客的需要。但是許多人買舊貨，恐怕上當，弄得不好選要遭受舊華攤主的咒罵；其實，買舊貨只要有訣巧，就不致吃虧，其中最主要的一點，是在未買之前先在心中擬定一個約略的價目，然後再問價利還價。往往有些人和賣舊貨的糾驟了一陣，結果沒有成交。這時，比較客氣些的攤主就出口相罵，兇狠些的就料集了同黨，逼着你非買不可了。還有，買舊貨上當大都是太貪便宜，滑稽中有一個鄉人以七千元買「西買」金錶的笑話，結果中了「翻戲」，弄得財貨兩失。這段笑話雖然渲染過份些，但相仿的情形倒的確有。所以，較市價相差太遠的東西決不能買，尤其是兜賣的貨色，更買不得。</p>
<p>武定路上的舊貨攤大約有一百餘個。傍晚六時左右，各流動貨攤滙合時，數目再增加一倍。這時買賣東西的人堆在一處，對於交通衛生都有極大的影響，，祗因直接間接就舊貨生活的人約有一二萬人，所以警局方面已在不　交通與衛生的情形下，准許他們設攤交易了。</p>
<h3>站雖設而不停　請問為何要設站？</h3>
<p>— 荷亭</p>
<p>前些天，有點事想上紅口走一趟，本來想騎自由車去的，但記起Ｇ的慘死，也就不敢了。</p>
<p>我家是住在貝當路，一出門就奔隔履理路高思路口的紅色公共汽車站，可是，出事意料：居然五輛挺空的車子，一輛也不停，而站上的人一共也不過三四人而已，而車子偏不停，你有何法！不得已，只好走到巨福路站頭，而車照樣不停，我這可光火了，可是光火亦無濟於事，無可奈何，祗好又走了一站，走到祁齊路，這回，總算搭上了車子，但，人還沒站穩，車身便移動了，差點出事。</p>
<p>後來，聽人說才知道：　　　　豆隔路這算小站頭車　　不停的，菲得跑到如　齊路殺的大站頭才搭得上車。可這　真奇怪，「站」不管是大站小站總是個「站」，公慺設定的「站」，不能爲了司機　　員的　　而勞　客大走其寃枉路哇！</p>
<h3>時事雜詠</h3>

<p>兵氣難銷民力盡　羣黎嗟歎俟河淸</p>
<p>鹽鐵三齊自古雄　桓寬管仲論相同</p>

<p>管子治齊務事鹽鐵，桓寬百論，所見正同。今山東爲南北交通孔道，煤鹽生產中心，而阻斷停滯，食貨源缺，物價遂以高揚。</p>

<h3>寄給亡婦鳳君（十九）</h3>
<p>— 周瘦鵑</p>
<p>更有一件重要的事情要報吿你的，那就是我已決定重建我們的正屋了。原來當你五七之期珍侯譖兄伉儷來蘇弔唁時，眼見我住在那三問聊敝風雨的木棚子裏，認爲有隨時發生危險的可能。一到秋季，往往常發颶風，這並無基樁而勉强支撐了九年的棚子，說不定會支撐不住而隨風而去，所以爲安全起見，非將正屋重建起來不可，要是力有未逮、他願意助我一臂。此外蘇地的幾位好友如鄒荆老和周幼鴻莫經　毛　甫程小靑諸兄，也勸我說幹就幹，事不宜遲，不妨因陋就簡的蓋好算了。於是由於　甫兄的介紹，均一立誠　正直的祝建築師承辦下來，因爲資力不充，仍然恢復平房，大約兩個月後，就可完工；而為了要利用舊料起見，必須拆卸這座木棚子，因此之故，只得把在你去世六十日紀念的那天，請了一名道士來把你的　臺撤去了。這對於你，又是一件非常抱歉的事，照例每天中午，不能再供飯菜，不知你可要捱餓不捱餓？可是你的遺像仍然供着，並且仍然將花果煙茶點心供奉你，每天我仍然有幾次來喚你的名字，和你談話，仍如平日一樣；到得木棚拆去之後，那就移供到書房中去，料想以你生前的賢德，一定也能體諒我於死後吧？鄒荆老他們因我斷絃之後，孤守家園，未免過於凄淸；因此過了三七，就邀我每天傍晚上靑年會去茶話解悶，舊雨新知，謔浪笑傲，當眞使我排除了心中不少的苦痛。有時也看看電影和話劇，使身心有二三小時的寄託，不過沒有你在我的身旁，總不免有願影凄凉之感！</p>
<p>自從你一去之後，我的心神也似乎跟着你同去，不知迷失在甚麽地方，除了午後外出，其餘的時間，總是呆木木的與花木爲伍，連　墨書本都不願親近；我的靈感閉塞了，智　消失了，要做這麽一二篇哀悼你的文章或一二十首悼亡詩，竟無從下筆，只覺千頭萬緒，有如一把亂麻。想不寫吧，又覺得過意不去，直挨延到了五處之期纔決定寫一封信給你，和你一通音間；誰知不動筆便罷，一動筆就得引起種孤的回憶思昔撫今，全是傷心斷腸的材料，往往淚隨筆下，　與淚俱，寫不上幾行，就拋掉了筆，寫不下去了。所以遣麼一封信，直寫了兩個多月方始結束，要算是我生平寫作最慢的作品，說來多麽慚愧啊！你接到了這封信，個有君不愼的字句，不妨就近問問榕兒；倘能在夢中和我一覓，那就算接到了你的回信；因爲一切都可面談，而訴盡這兩個月來的相思之苦了。唉！鳳呀鳳，我希望你在最近的將來，翩然入夢，指示我一條新生之路，給與我最大的勇氣，讓我好好地活下！鳳，我等着你，苦苦的等着你；你快到夢中來吧！餘容面聲，祝康樂！你的廿九年的老伴鵑抆淚手　。　六月三十日</p>

        <h1>1946.07.28</h1>
<h3>Ambassador Stuart Arrives in Kuling Yesterday; Immediately After Unpacking, He Meets with Marshal Ma and Formulates New Suggestions for Our Overall Situation</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Nanking, 27th] Ambassador Stuart arrived in Kuling at 11:10 AM today, following Marshal Ma's departure from Nanking to Kiukiang and then to Kuling. As the KMT-CCP negotiations are about to resume, the visit of the two men to Lushan has brought a sense of calm to the political atmosphere here. It is reported that both men will return to Nanking next Monday. Marshal Ma and Stuart's purpose in going is to convey to Chairman Chiang the opinions offered by Zhou Enlai in his separate discussions with the two men. It is said that the Communist Party's insistence is for an immediate and unconditional comprehensive ceasefire and the resumption of the Political Consultative Conference (PCC), and that a document similar to a ceasefire agreement has been drafted and taken to Lushan by Ambassador Stuart. This place is currently quietly awaiting the return of Marshal Ma and Ambassador Stuart. It is speculated that the current point of contention between the two sides is that the government wants to reach an agreement on restoring transportation, reorganizing the army, and a ceasefire before implementing the decisions made by the past PCC, item by item. The Communist Party's insistence on immediately convening the PCC is unnecessary because all basic issues have already been agreed upon in the past PCC. Moreover, since the beginning of the talks, the Communist side has lacked sincerity, and whenever the negotiations are about to conclude, they raise new demands, causing complications and overturning agreements. Although the government has repeatedly made concessions and shown tolerance, it has been unable to make progress in the negotiations. Therefore, based on past lessons, the government has to insist on signing after reaching an agreement on everything, so that the Communist Party cannot repeat its old tricks. Although the whole country is paying attention to whether the Chairman will issue a ceasefire order when the two men go to Lushan again, the entire future depends on the fundamental attitude of the Communists.</p>
<p>[Dispatch from the Central News Agency, Kuling, 27th] Ambassador Leighton Stuart arrived in Kuling from Nanking at 4:30 PM on the 27th and is still residing at No. 8 Hedong Road. Marshal Marshall visited immediately after the ambassador unpacked and had a long conversation.</p>
<p>[Dispatch from Reuters, Nanking, 27th] Before leaving for Kuling today, Ambassador Stuart stated that he hoped this trip would break the deadlock in the negotiations by the end of the week. He said: "New suggestions have been drafted by Marshall and me to strive for mutual acceptance by both sides. I have high hopes for this because the difficulties lie not in fundamental issues, but only in procedural matters."</p>
<h3>Chairman Sends Gu Zhutong to Kunming with Full Authority to Handle the Li Wen Case and Reaffirms the Previous Order to Protect the People; Gu, Lu, Huo, and Zhang Left Kuling for Kunming Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Kuling, 27th] At 10 PM last night, Chairman Chiang ordered Army Commander-in-Chief Gu Zhutong to proceed swiftly to Kunming to take charge of commanding the local military, government, police, and gendarmerie to solve the assassination of Li Gongpu and Wen Yiduo within a week, so that the perpetrators can be severely punished. He also ordered Yunnan Chairman Lu Han, Gendarmerie Commander Zhang Zhen, and Kunming Garrison Commander Huo Kuizhang to assist in the handling of the matter. Today, Gu, Lu, Zhang, and Huo have flown to Kunming from Kiukiang on a special plane of the Air Transport Brigade.</p>
<p>[Dispatch from the Central News Agency, Kuling, 27th] When the assassination case occurred in Kunming, Chairman Chiang had secretly ordered all headquarters, pacification commissions, and provincial and municipal governments throughout the country to earnestly protect the lives and property of the people, especially unarmed parties and factions. He has recently telegraphed again to ensure strict compliance with the previous order and has sent Army Commander-in-Chief Gu Zhutong to Kunming with full authority to handle the Li Wen assassination case. This was announced by Chen Fang, Director of the Political Affairs Bureau of the National Government, and Secretary Cao Shengfen at a press conference held in Kuling at 6 PM on the 27th. Director Chen also said that the Chairman's Kuling residence should be renamed the "Headquarters."</p>
<p>(Dispatch from the Central News Agency, Kuling, 27th) Tang Zong, Director of the Police General Administration, arrived in Kuling from Shanghai on the 27th and will call on Chairman Chiang to report on the thorough investigation of the Li Wen assassination case in Kunming.</p>
<h3>National Army Reorganization: Second Phase Fully Completed</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Nanking, 27th] The second phase of the National Army reorganization has been fully completed. It is reported that the implementation of the third phase of the reorganization plan depends on the future of the KMT-CCP negotiations.</p>
<h3>Chiang Menglin Arrives in Kuling</h3>
<p>[Dispatch from the Central News Agency, Kuling, 27th] Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan Chiang Menglin arrived in Kuling from Nanking at 3 PM on the 27th. It is said that Premier Song originally intended to accompany Marshal Ma but ultimately cancelled due to other engagements. Instead, he sent Chiang to Kuling to call on Chairman Chiang and report on the recent situation of the Executive Yuan since the Chairman left Nanking, as well as to seek instructions.</p>
<h3>If China Falls into Communist Hands, World War III Will Be Unveiled: Remarks by the President of an American Seminary</h3>
<p>[Dispatch from the Central News Agency, New York, 26th] Dr. Henry Sloane Coffin, President of the Union Theological Seminary, stated in his speech at the 28th annual meeting of pastors and religious leaders here that if China falls into Communist hands, it will be the prelude to World War III. Therefore, China's fate is not only of extraordinary importance to the security of the United States, but is also of greater direct importance than any other event occurring anywhere else in the world.</p>
<h3>Cai Wenzhi Loses Interest, Ye Jianying Has Nothing to Say, Belode Returns to Beiping from Qingdao</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Beiping, 27th] Belode, who was recuperating in Qingdao, has gradually recovered and recently returned to Beiping to continue his work. Cai Wenzhi has requested resignation, and it is said that there will be no problems. Belode has repeatedly stated that he has lost interest in this fruitless work. Recently, he has continuously published articles, one discussing the collectivization of actions and the other discussing the significance of testing atomic bombs. He has not attended the Tripartite Executive Headquarters meetings for a long time. Ye Jianying firmly refuses to see reporters, saying he has nothing to say. Luo Ruiqing has resigned as the Communist Party's Chief of Staff, and it has been decided that Chen Shi Chu will replace him. Communist Party personnel have admitted that the Communist army has withdrawn from Jiayuan, and also stated that Wang Tiehan, commander of the 49th Division, escaped during his transfer after being captured, thus ending the rumors of Wang's capture. They also stated that the deputy army commander was indeed captured. The Communist Party also does not expect much from Li Lisan's trip to Shenyang, believing that it will not yield any results.</p>
<h3>Guo Qi Zhi to be Transferred to Military Attaché at the Italian Embassy</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Nanking, 27th] Major General Guo Qi Zhi, head of the War Information Publication Group of the Ministry of National Defense, will be transferred to Military Attaché at the Italian Embassy. The vacant position will be filled by the director of the Propaganda Department of the Ministry. Guo is likely to leave the country in early next month to take up his new post.</p>
<h3>Ambassador Gu Speaks in America: Believes Marshal Ma's Efforts Have Not Failed; Our Government Has No Intention of Imposing Excessive Restrictions on Foreign Businesses</h3>
<p>[Dispatch from United Press, Washington, 27th] Ambassador Gu Weijun stated today that regarding the KMT-CCP issue, the Chinese government hopes for a peaceful resolution and does not believe that the Communist Party is willing to bear the responsibility of "plunging the country into civil war." Regarding the efforts of Special Envoy Marshall to promote peace in China, I believe that they have not failed, and I hope that Marshall will continue his efforts in China. The Chinese government has no intention of imposing excessive restrictions on foreign businesses in China through laws that would cause them to suffer losses. China is willing to trade with foreign countries and hopes that foreign businessmen can reside and work in China as they have in the past. The Sino-US Commercial Treaty may be signed in a few weeks. This treaty is sufficient to prove that commercial exchanges between China and the United States are very active, and that the Chinese government has no intention of hindering the development of Sino-US commerce.

<h3>Changchun Forward Detachment Announces Discussions on Establishing a Buffer Zone; Agreement May Also Be Reached on Power Transmission and Prisoner Repatriation</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Beiping, 28th] While the flames of war have not yet subsided in China Proper, the Northeast presents a picture of peace. Certain minor issues, such as prisoner repatriation, power transmission, and buffer zones, may be resolved. Regarding the repatriation of Japanese prisoners of war and Japanese nationals from the Communist-controlled areas, the Communist Party has indicated that there is no problem in principle. Colonel Bavin and Lieutenant Colonel Mullin of the U.S. Prisoner Repatriation Group of the Executive Headquarters are currently in Changchun to discuss specific measures with the Communist Party. An agreement should be reached soon. Regarding the issue of power supply from Xiaofengman to Shenyang, the Shenyang electricity shortage is severe because a section of the line in the middle is occupied and damaged by the Communist army. The government and the Communist Party have now agreed that the Communist Party will repair the damaged lines in the Communist-controlled area, and the government will repair the lines in the government-controlled area, and then they will be connected to transmit power. Regarding the buffer zone in the Songhua River area, although an agreement has not yet been fully reached, the commanders of both sides have agreed in a meeting that neither side will attack before receiving new instructions.

<h3>Internal Strife Among the Democratic League; Zhang Lan and Luo Longji Debate Neutrality</h3>
<p>[Dispatch from the Central News Agency, Nanking, 27th] An internal dispute over neutrality has recently broken out within the Democratic League. The fact that League Chairman Zhang Lan and Luo Longji had a public dispute over this issue today clearly shows that the two men have different views on neutrality. Zhang, a proponent of neutrality, stated in his article "The Attitude and Style of the Democratic League," published in the Chengdu Huaxi Evening News a few days ago: "Mr. Luo Longji said in a speech in Shanghai that our Democratic League is not neutral towards the KMT and the CCP, but has a sense of right and wrong. This was a personal statement and a small error. Our Democratic League has always stood on the position of the Democratic League, and must adhere to neutrality towards the KMT and the CCP. Standing on the position of the country, we must clearly distinguish right from wrong in the actions of the KMT and the CCP." Zhang also said: "The Democratic League is willing to abide by the Three Principles of the People and is also willing to support Chairman Chiang. If the Three Principles of the People can be implemented, and political democratization and military nationalization can be achieved without being empty words, our Democratic League will be devoted to the ruling Kuomintang, not just become its tail." It is understood that after Zhang's article was published, Luo Longji reportedly told people that his remarks in Shanghai stated that the Democratic League stands on the position of the Chinese people and is not neutral towards the Chinese civil war. Only foreigners need to strictly adhere to neutrality. Luo believes that Zhang Lan's remarks may have been caused by a misunderstanding of the content of his remarks. Luo also said: The headquarters of the Democratic League is now in Nanking, and his personal remarks have their own basis. In the future, the documents of the Democratic League should be based on those published by the headquarters. As for Zhang's articles, they may have been ghostwritten by others.</p>

<h3>Minister Peng Hosts Shanghai Reporters, Condemns "Unconditional Ceasefire": The CCP Merely Seeks to Delay, The People of North China Provinces are Suffering Deeply from Blockade</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent] Peng Xuepei, Minister of Information, arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing on the 25th. Yesterday (the 27th) at 4 p.m., he hosted reporters in the Shanghai Municipal Government conference room. Minister Peng began by stating: "I had the pleasure of hosting you all here three weeks ago. I am especially pleased to reconvene today. I am willing to answer any questions to the best of my knowledge." Subsequently, reporters from various newspapers successively rose to ask questions, which Minister Peng answered in detail.</p>
<p>Kunming Incident</p>
<p>(Question) What is the situation regarding the Kunming assassination case?</p>
<p>(Answer) The government attaches great importance to the case and has dispatched key personnel to Kunming to investigate. The Executive Yuan has ordered all regions to take responsibility for protecting the lives and property of the people, and it is especially important to strengthen protection during these tense times. Twelve members of the Democratic League in Kunming sought refuge in the American consulate. The Executive Yuan specifically telegraphed local authorities instructing them to provide protection to those who seek government protection without hindering their freedom of movement. Although there are leads in the case, we do not intend to speculate before the full truth is revealed. However, once the truth is determined, those responsible, regardless of their affiliation, will be severely punished.</p>
<p>(Question) It has been reported that a certain young master was involved. Can you share the details?</p>
<p>(Answer) This is a legal matter. I prefer to disclose the full truth after it is fully understood.</p>
<p>Peace Negotiations</p>
<p>(Question) Since Ambassador Stuart's arrival, there is hope for a breakthrough in the KMT-CCP negotiations. Ambassador Marshall is now returning to Guling. Please provide an update on the negotiations and the military situation. On the 22nd, Moscow Radio criticized the United States for failing to complete the withdrawal in accordance with the decisions of the Three Foreign Ministers Conference. What is the government's view on Moscow Radio's urging of the US military withdrawal? The Wenhui Bao was suspended for seven days by the Shanghai Police Bureau. What is the legal basis for this?</p>
<p>(Answer) The rapid progress of the peace negotiations is detailed in the news. I have nothing further to add. The government initially ordered a two-week ceasefire, which was later extended by ten days. The duration of the negotiations cannot be considered short, and a beneficial resolution should have been reached, but it has not been. The government feels that the key lies in the reorganization and unification of the army, and the restoration of transportation. These two points are equally important. To date, the CCP still only proposes "unconditional ceasefire." We are all striving for a ceasefire. However, we cannot ignore several pressing issues that urgently need to be resolved. If we ignore these issues and only talk about "unconditional ceasefire," its meaning will be tantamount to the unconditional secession of the Northeast, the unconditional interruption of transportation, and the unconditional competition in army expansion and increased military spending. In short, this will be tantamount to unconditionally prolonging the chaotic political and military situation and trapping the country in difficulty. The CCP's suggestion of an "unconditional ceasefire" is due to the CCP's violation of the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference, occupation of most of the Northeast, and its attempt to prolong economic chaos to gain "revolutionary" opportunities. I will now briefly cite several pieces of evidence to illustrate the economic suffering, high prices, and the people's lack of livelihood, which are largely due to the CCP's blockade of Shandong, Henan, and Northern Jiangsu. The reason is that once the two major railways, Jinpu Railway and Pinghan Railway, are cut off, the north-south freight transport is interrupted, prices soar, and refugees cannot return home; The main coal producing areas are in Shandong and Henan provinces. Today, they are either destroyed or produce very little, almost at a standstill. Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin and other places must rely on Qinhuangdao for long-distance coal supplies, so the price is as high as 230,000 yuan per ton; The food supply for Beijing, Tianjin, Jinan, and Qingdao has always relied on areas outside these cities. The monthly rice demand for Beijing and Tianjin is 600,000 dan, and for Jinan and Qingdao it is 240,000 dan, all supplied by villages in Hebei and Shandong provinces. Today, due to the CCP's blockade, they must be supplied by Beijing and Shanghai, but Beijing and Shanghai are not rice-producing areas, so it indirectly affects the food problem in Beijing and Shanghai, which becomes more serious and spreads throughout the country; According to a 1936 survey, Hebei produced 8 million dan of salt, Shandong produced 7.5 million dan, and Northern Jiangsu produced 9 million dan. The total national production was 48 million dan, and consumption was 34 million dan. Now, one-third of the salt production area in Hebei is occupied by the CCP, and most of the production areas in Shandong and Northern Jiangsu are in the hands of the CCP, so salt cannot be transported out, causing salt shortages in North and Central China. From this, we can see that economic difficulties are closely related to the CCP's blockade policy. The restoration of transportation is of vital importance to the people and cannot be delayed any longer. Therefore, the ceasefire is what the government has always advocated, but various urgent issues other than the ceasefire should also be resolved together.</p>
<p>Regarding the second point, the US military has provided assistance in China for many years and is greatly related to the victory. Even after the victory, its assistance was significant in all aspects such as the repatriation of POWs. We are all grateful for this. Currently, their assistance is still needed for POW repatriation. In the future, we also hope that they can provide technical assistance in military reorganization. Most of the US military has now withdrawn, leaving only a very small part in China, which does not harm our sovereignty. Last year, the US government announced its policy toward China, stating that it would provide economic assistance to China under the condition that the government's foundation is expanded. We firmly believe that the US motivation is based on sincere friendship, and we have worked hard to achieve it. This is also our goal. However, the CCP's procrastination in resolving problems makes us suspect that the CCP is delaying its cooperation with the government as it learns of the US intentions. The CCP's attitude is to avoid resolving various issues and hope that economic difficulties and a chaotic situation will allow them to seize national power in the near future. This strategy is clearly sufficient to destroy the ultimate goal of US policy toward China and infinitely delay the realization of Sino-US cooperation and mutual assistance.</p>
<p>Regarding the third point: The Wenhui Bao was executed according to martial law and the publication law by the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau, and the Ministry of Propaganda has no objections. I only hope that during this tense period, we should be especially cautious in our writing and hope to cooperate with the government.</p>
<p>Other Questions</p>
<p>(Question) The National Assembly is about to convene. Does the government have any plans for reorganization before the convention?</p>
<p>(Answer) The government can reorganize at any time, and the scope of the reorganization can be large or small, but all basic issues must be effectively resolved first. If all practical solutions cannot be obtained, then political forces will not be able to achieve true close cooperation.</p>
<p>Minister Peng pointed out that the Soviet Union's "Izvestia" attacked the National Salvation Daily, saying that our press should handle speech related to diplomatic relations with extreme care. He stated: "The opinion of one newspaper cannot represent the opinion of the majority. However, at present, we should avoid articles that stimulate the feelings of allied countries, whether it is toward the Soviet Union, the United States, or the United Kingdom and France. During this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for construction, we should bury our heads in hard work for thirty to fifty years and never casually criticize foreign countries." He also said: Today, there are a few newspapers with various attacks on the United States, which should be avoided.</p>
<p>At this point, it was 5:15 p.m. Because Minister Peng still had to host foreign reporters, he announced the adjournment of the meeting.</p>

<h3>Local Correspondence</h3>
<p>The Price of Indigo in Xiyi is Low, Requesting Government Purchase</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Wuxi] The preparatory office of the Wuxi County Cooperative Federation stated that since the government had lent 70% of the funds to farmers as relief during the spring rains this year, the farmers did not sell their dried indigo. Selling at the current market price of indigo would result in huge losses. It has telegraphed the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Economic Affairs, the Jiangsu Provincial Government, and the Construction Department to appeal for relief, requesting the government to order the China Silk Company to purchase the indigo at the standard price plus interest. After the telegram was sent, the Ministry of Economic Affairs instructed that the Shanghai China Silk Company had been ordered to handle the matter. The association sent representatives Tang Hongchu and others to Shanghai on the 25th to negotiate. However, because General Manager Ge of the China Silk Company had left Shanghai for Guangzhou, they did not get the gist of the matter and will go to Shanghai to petition again. When Tang and others were in Shanghai, they also requested the Shanghai branch of the National Commodity Sales Agency of the Ministry of Social Affairs to allocate 500 bags of Taiwan sugar per month, which was approved.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Who is Peace For?</h3>
<p>Special Envoy Marshall flew from Nanjing to Guling again the day before yesterday, running around for peace in China. He and Ambassador Stuart, at such advanced ages, braved the summer heat and the rain, traveling between Nanjing and Guling, all in the name of seeking peace for China.</p>
<p>As ordinary Chinese citizens, we feel ashamed and indignant to see that after the country's victory, we still have to trouble our allies so much. Ashamed because why can't the Chinese take care of their own affairs? Why can't the kind guidance of our allies inspire the conscience of the Chinese people to save themselves and seek peace? Indignant because the Chinese people, especially the approximately 80% who are farmers, have suffered from natural and man-made disasters and are on the verge of death, and yet there are still ambitious politicians who rely on force, create internal strife, and divide the country. They claim to solve the problems of the farmers, but in reality, they are making the farmers wander around, abandoning their fields, and ultimately "unable to return home," forced to be coerced and slaughtered. Amidst this intertwined complex of shame and indignation, as Marshall and Stuart are enthusiastically running around for peace, we can no longer bear it and want to ask one question: "Who is peace for, after all?"</p>
<p>Let us first straightforwardly answer ourselves: "Peace is for the Chinese people!"</p>
<p>Some may think that this question is superfluous, but it is not. Because some Chinese and foreign people have overlooked the most important point: the reason why China needs peace is to allow the Chinese people to live and work in peace and contentment, to allow the people to breathe after the war, to achieve peace and contentment, and to revive and build the country. However, if they disregard this key point, they will inevitably misjudge things to some extent, thinking that China wants peace so that parties can divide power, or thinking that China wants peace so that the Chinese issue will not cause World War III. In fact, these have nothing to do with the Chinese people. Even if there is some relationship, it is not direct, let alone the immediate pain of the people. What the Chinese people care about most is that they can return to their hometowns, return home, cultivate their fields, have factories and mines to work in, and have open railways and sea routes to transport goods back and forth for business. In short, their most basic and simple requirement is the four words "live and work in peace and contentment." Those who seek peace and those who engage in the peace movement, whether Chinese or foreign, must focus on this in order to find a proper path and obtain concrete results. If they do not think about how the people can live and work in peace and contentment, but only think about how a certain party or faction can get a share of the power or occupy a province or city in military power, that is simply abandoning the root and pursuing the branches. Although the efforts are great, it is still a big question whether it will be effective.</p>
<p>We dare to say: Peace is a means, and the people's peaceful life and work is the goal. The government's responsibility to the people is to enable them to live and work in peace and contentment. If peaceful methods can allow the people to enjoy the blessings of "peaceful life and work," we can negotiate peacefully. We not only do not object, but also welcome it; on the contrary, if the government is only focused on peace negotiations, but the people still cannot return to their hometowns, cannot return home, cannot live in peace, cannot work in contentment, and even increase their pain of being displaced and unemployed, as is the case in Northern Jiangsu, Southern Shandong, and Central Shanxi, how will the government be worthy of the people? To give a few more examples: How can the industries and businesses in cities such as Beijing, Shanghai, Qingdao, and Jinan recover? Needless to say, it must rely on the production of farmland and coal mines in Jiangsu, Anhui, Shandong, and Henan. If the Huai River basin at the junction of Northern Jiangsu, Northern Anhui, Shandong, and Henan is always occupied by the CCP's army, which attempts to divide China, disrupting railways and highways and failing to supply food and coal, how can we expect the industries and businesses in these places to recover? The situation is the same in the Beijing-Tianjin area. If the CCP's army in Shanxi and along the Jinpu and Beining Railways continues to jump around, how can cities like Beijing and Tianjin recover and prosper? Therefore, we believe that the problem today is not really whether there is peace or not, but whether the government can protect the people's peaceful life and work. This is the government's responsibility! The government must not use the obstruction of a certain party or faction or the disruption of a certain army or division as an excuse to close the door to peaceful resolution, and just watch the people suffer forever, wander, and be displaced and unemployed without saving them! If the government only knows how to pretend to be "peaceful" and ignores the life and death of the people, all the evils in the world will spread under the protection of the "peace" amulet, then the people will hold the government accountable.</p>
<p>Speaking of this, we cannot but admire the correctness of the New York Times' observation. The New York Times' commentary on the 24th believed that if there is "any protest about the Chinese peace issue, it should not be directed at the National Government and its supporters, but should severely condemn those who oppose the government and divide China." This is a truly insightful argument. All the problems in China today stem from the fact that there are some people inside and outside who are trying to "divide China!" Because they vainly attempt to divide China, they do not hesitate to oppose the National Government, do not hesitate to slander the leaders of China, do not hesitate to lower China's international status, do not hesitate to create internal strife in China, do not hesitate to use brutal prisoners of war and have them use their weapons to kill Chinese people, do not hesitate to coerce kind Chinese farmers, thereby destroying railways, robbing goods, and harming the credibility of legal tender, provoking resentment between labor and management, and disrupting the entire financial and market situation. All their methods aim to prevent China from being peaceful, to prevent the Chinese people from having food to eat, to prevent the Chinese people from living and working in peace and contentment after the war, and even more to prevent China from achieving, as we hope, a strong, unified, and democratic China in the years after the war. Their mantra is "peace," but their actions all run counter to the peace that the people hope for.</p>
<p>Therefore, today, we are willing to sincerely remind the party leaders in China who claim to be third parties and the fair-minded friends in the United States: If you truly want to seek peace for China, sincerely ask the people what they hope for. The Chinese people only long for two things: The National Government, recognized by China and foreign countries, will automatically move towards democracy and progress in politics, expand the foundation of the government, and quickly implement the Three Principles of the People, especially the economic policies of the Principle of People's Livelihood. The National Government, recognized by China and foreign countries, must thoroughly implement its national policy of unifying military and political orders in military affairs, be responsible for protecting all kind people, and enable them to live and work in peace and contentment in the short term, and there is absolutely no reason to allow this half-dead situation to drag on. In particular, we want to urge those who intend to promote peace in China to quickly realize that the more you overemphasize the CCP, which is known for its broken promises, the more the CCP will be smug and act recklessly, making it even more difficult to achieve peace in China. Everyone must turn around and think about the people, not just the Communist Party, and then the peace in China that we achieve will be the true peace of China, the permanent peace of China.</p>

<h3>Asahi Shimbun Discusses Nanjing Massacre: Japanese Army's Shameless Atrocities; People Were Deceived</h3>
<p>[United Press Tokyo, 27th] The Asahi Shimbun discussed today the testimony regarding the Japanese army's atrocities in Nanjing given at the Far East International Military Tribunal yesterday, stating: The Nanjing atrocities were known to the world at the time, but only the Japanese people were kept in the dark about the shameless behavior of their army. The military's news reports concealed the Nanjing atrocities. The Japanese people did not suspect that such terrifying atrocities were occurring while they were waving flags and celebrating victory. At that time, Japanese newspapers were filled with war exploits and did not contain a single word about the truth of the Nanjing Incident. Recalling this, one cannot help but feel regret. The commander of the Japanese army involved in the atrocities was praised, and none of his subordinates were punished, which clearly proves that Japan had lost all conscience at the time.</p>

<h3>Many Japanese Industries to Be Taken Over by US Military</h3>
<p>[United Press Tokyo, 27th] Many Japanese industries used to pay for reparations will be taken over by the US Eighth Army and the US Navy in the near future. Based on the suggestion of Commissioner Pauley, it is expected that the factories to be taken over will include machine tool manufacturing plants, shipyards, steel mills, power plants, aluminum and magnesium manufacturing plants, and some chemical manufacturing plants. There are already 390 Japanese factories, such as aircraft factories and ordnance factories, that were taken over by MacArthur's headquarters in January of last year. According to Pauley's provisional recommendation: half of the machine tools, equipment, and parts in Japan's 20 shipyards should be removed, and the equipment of the remaining coal-fired power plants and 20 caustic soda manufacturing plants, as well as the production of aluminum and magnesium, should also be reduced by half. This would make it so Japan is soft to manage. The work and production of some Japanese factories will be temporarily suspended, and the production of the remaining factories will also be gradually reduced. Under the supervision of the US military, the Japanese side will classify and prepare a list of the equipment of each factory and send it to Washington for the Far Eastern Commission's reference. Countries that are to receive Japanese reparations will submit their compensation requests based on the list.</p>

<h3>Soviet Union Closes in on German Intellectuals; Adopts Appeasement Tactics</h3>
<p>[United Press Berlin, 26th] The Soviet Union is taking a two-pronged approach to win the friendship of those in the German cultural sphere, taking into account both the pride and vanity of the Germans and their stomachs, a tactic that the British and Americans have not matched. According to a certain German intellectual, the Soviet Union never makes us feel like a defeated country, while the British and Americans often make us feel that they are the victors at certain times. A famous German playwright said that if we want to publish or stage a script, we have to contact the Americans ourselves to make it happen. The Soviet side does not hesitate to take the initiative, even using special material conditions to induce artists to cooperate. According to some Germans, at a time when bread is scarce in the country and money is especially important, a waitress in the American-occupied zone earns more to fill her stomach than the best musician. In the current situation in Germany, it seems that only wages that fill the stomach are the most important.</p>
<h3>Brandy Risks Danger on Official Duty; Personally Inspects Bikini Atoll; Suffers Atomic Radiation Attack</h3>
<p>[International News Service Bikini, 27th] Today's News: General Brandy suffered excessive atomic radiation yesterday while inspecting the target ships "Long" and "Pennsylvania," exceeding the limit by 5%. Colonel Warren, director of the Hydrogen Radiation Safety Protection Team, said: "If General Brandy had stayed there for a few more minutes yesterday, he and his entourage would have suffered serious damage."</p>
<h3>Analysis of the German Governance Problem; Translated by the United States Information Service from "US News"</h3>
<p>The establishment of European peace has encountered difficulties due to the question of whether Germany should remain unified or be divided into four parts. The US and Britain advocate maintaining German unity and merging the four occupation zones into one. The US and Britain now spend 500 million dollars annually on their occupying forces in Germany. If their proposal is realized, perhaps the number of occupying forces can be reduced. Byrnes suggested that American military force should still be used for 25 years to guarantee that the rebuilt Germany remains demilitarized and does not disrupt peace. The Soviet Union and France oppose German unification. France advocates separating the Ruhr and Rhineland regions from Germany and governing them separately under international control. According to France's idea, if France is not to be threatened by German aggression, Germany must be a semi-independent, weak, and loose federation. The Soviet Union seems to have no concrete plan on how to deal with Germany in the future, but it clearly opposes the new American plan. Currently, Germany has already been divided into four parts.</p>
<p>The Four Powers Act Independently</p>
<p>Therefore, extremely high isolation barriers have been built around the four occupation zones. The Soviet occupation zone is east of the Elbe River, and major changes are now taking place in the zone. The Soviets have begun to close banks and confiscate assets. They have divided all the assets of the Junker families among the farmers, and they have also formed powerful trade unions for the workers in the mines and factories, in a form similar to Soviet trade unions. The Soviet authorities are making factory owners choose between two paths: either the factory is operated according to the orders of the trade union, or it is dismantled and sent to the Soviet Union. American observers report: the Soviet zone is like an extremely tense beehive, and the number of unemployed people seems to have decreased. The current production of factories has reached 90% of their productivity. The land in the Soviet-occupied zone accounts for 27% of Germany's arable land and is sufficient to feed the 21 million people in the zone.</p>
<p>The American Occupation Zone</p>
<p>In western Germany, the area is similar to the Soviet-occupied zone, but in all other respects, they are unlike each other. The land, raw materials, and industries are not enough to feed and employ the 18 million people in the zone. The mines and factories in the zone were once estimated to account for 20% of Germany's production, but at this moment they are useless because they lack coal, oil, steel, rubber, and other raw materials. Although the US has shipped large quantities of rice, the zone is still suffering from a rice shortage. The production of factories that have been decided not to be dismantled for reparations is only 10% to 20% of their productivity. As a result, nearly one-third of the workers are unemployed, and most of the population in the towns and cities, whether employed or unemployed, is not fed, clothed, or housed well. Under these circumstances, the American side finds it difficult to rebuild the occupation zone like America, according to capitalist democracy. As a result of implementing the plan to eliminate Nazi forces, 300,000 Nazis have been discovered, but the scourge of the Nazi Party is still taking place underground. Although anti-Nazi parties have been revived, so far they seem to have no clear direction. As for the British, who occupy the industrialized Ruhr region, they have also encountered political difficulties, but the economic situation is much better than the American side.</p>
<p>The British Occupation Army Government</p>
<p>Has enabled the zone's industry to recover to 40% of its pre-war output. However, Ruhr coal usually supplies three-quarters of German industry and half of European industry's needs, but current production is only 35% of pre-war levels. Before the war, Germany produced 22 million tons of steel, with the Ruhr region accounting for two-thirds of this amount. This year, it can only produce 2 million tons. The British occupation zone is so important because the Ruhr has the potential for coal and steel production that is greater than any other region in Europe. As for agricultural production, it is still far from being self-sufficient. The zone has a population of 23 million, and the need for food imports is extremely high. In terms of industry, the Ruhr region accounted for 36% of Germany's total pre-war production. The British hope to increase the Ruhr's production to near pre-war levels as much as possible in order to help rebuild Europe and to open up the European market for British goods. However, France has always feared that the Ruhr will become a strategic powerhouse for Germany, unless the Ruhr can be separated from Germany and co-managed by the Allied countries, including France. Britain has informally proposed a compromise plan: the Ruhr is co-managed internationally for 50 years. French observers suspect that Britain's plan will be implemented when the Allied military occupation of Germany ends. If this is the case, the British will gradually Anglicize the Ruhr in a few years and tighten British control over the region.</p>
<p>From the Perspective of the French</p>
<p>The French occupation zone is another reason for French concern about the industrialized Ruhr. Among the four countries' occupation zones, the French occupation zone is the smallest and poorest. Its land, industry, and population account for only 8% of the total of Germany. Since the beginning of French rule, it has been trying its best to sell coal and building materials and transport them to France as soon as possible. In short, the Soviet Union is developing its occupation zone according to the ideals of Soviet communism. Therefore, land reforms have been carried out, trade unions manage industries, and the German Communist Party is politically very powerful. The British have already nationalized coal mines in the occupied zone and are planning to deal with other industries in the Ruhr region according to the policies of the British Labour Party. The United States promotes free enterprise and hopes to use the advantages of capitalism and democracy to eliminate the disadvantages of Nazism. The French occupation zone is reflecting France's chaotic and experimental situation. Due to each acting independently.</p>
<p>Economic Isolation in the Four Zones</p>
<p>Difficulties are increasing. There is still no unified currency, financial, or accounting policy in Germany. Prices vary in each zone. Trade between zones is small and irregular, often carried out through long military negotiations and barter trade. Even transportation is hindered by zonal boundaries. In terms of Germany's four parts, no zone can obtain the raw materials needed to manufacture its required goods. Therefore, the result is economic depression everywhere. On a larger scale, economic depression has also occurred throughout Europe. The goods that Europe urgently needs for reconstruction cannot be adequately satisfied due to the lack of German coal and , German technology and transportation networks. Politically speaking, the German Communist Party is trying to merge with the German Social Democratic Party. The smaller Communist Party hopes to promote the newly formed organization through this merger and expand its influence to all occupation zones. This is indeed a political control approach. What Western Allied countries are most concerned about is that the economic depression in western Germany may just be clearing the way for the German Communist Party's influence. Recently, American publishers traveled to the American-occupied zone in Germany and felt that the current policies must be changed. The reason is this. They believe that establishing a central government and amending the Potsdam Agreement may revive the European economy and tear down the separating walls that divide the four powers and Germany. The principles of the four-power treaty on Germany recently proposed by the US Secretary of State are also the same as those of the American publishers.</p>
<h3>Gunfire as Dense as Interlinked Beads Outside the Chongxin Yarn Factory: Robbery of Huge Sums, Police and Bandits Engage in Fierce Battle, One Bandit Seriously Wounded in a Crossfire, Two Cars Stolen and All Escape</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent] Yesterday, at the Chongxin Yarn Factory located at No. 1 Tanjia Ferry, West Guangfu Road, Zhabei, was the day for paying wages. At approximately 11:40 AM, over 45 million Legal Tender was withdrawn from the bank. The funds were transported by car to behind the No. 7 Factory of the China Textile Corporation on Changshou Road, where several employees carried them onto a ferry, fearing accidents. They requested a patrol officer for escort, who accompanied them across the Suzhou Creek. As the boat approached the opposite bank, two employees, each carrying a paper package containing 10 million (totaling 20 million) had just stepped onto the dock when two bandits, lying in wait, produced firearms, ordering them not to make a sound, and seized the 20 million. At this time, the patrol officer was still inside the cabin, witnessing the scene, realized it was a robbery, drew his gun and fired repeatedly until his ammunition was exhausted. One bullet struck a bandit in the back of the head, causing him to fall to the ground, bleeding profusely. Simultaneously, more than ten accomplices scattered around also opened fire to resist arrest, firing as many as thirty or forty shots. Two police officers inside the Chongxin Yarn Factory, hearing the dense gunfire like interlinked beads, fired several rifle shots from the upper floors towards the bandits. The bandits, caught in a crossfire, fearing they would be overwhelmed, hurriedly supported the wounded bandit and fled. After traveling about ten yards, they saw a red car decorated with flowers parked on the roadside (belonging to Chongxin, license plate 36149). The bandits swarmed into the car, the wounded bandit was also carried in, and one of the bandits drove eastward. At the intersection of Zhongshan Road and Gonghe Road, a gray ten-wheeled truck (license plate 272969) from the Transportation Department's Highway Administration, carrying several crates, was approaching. The bandits, finding that the flowered car had a mechanical failure and could not move forward, fearing pursuers, stopped the truck, forced the driver out at gunpoint, and one of the bandits drove it straight towards the urban area on Qishan Road. According to eyewitnesses, one of the wounded bandits in the red car fell out of the car due to the rough road, unconscious. Later, his accomplices carried him back into the car. Upon receiving the report, the Pulu Precinct immediately ordered all officers to pursue in all directions, and notified all precincts to be on the lookout for the Highway Administration truck that was robbed. Finally, at 9:30 PM, the truck was discovered on Tongzhou Road in Tilanqiao, empty.</p>
<h3>He De'kui Summoned to Beijing: The Case Against Him Will Soon Be Cleared</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent] A leader from industrial, commercial, and financial circles expressed his opinion to reporters yesterday regarding the accusations against He De'kui, stating that to his knowledge, Mr. He had made significant contributions to the government and the people in the past. During the enemy and puppet regime period, he resigned along with the British and American directors of the former Shanghai Municipal Council. His loyalty and patriotism have always been well-known to both Chinese and foreigners, and there is absolutely no suspicion of him being a traitor. He said that Mr. He was summoned to Beijing yesterday morning, and it is expected that the matter will soon be cleared.</p>
<h3>Municipal Government Changes Office Hours</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent] It has been confirmed that the Municipal Government will change its office hours starting from August 1st. The morning hours will remain from 8:00 AM to 12:00 PM, and the afternoon hours will be from 3:00 PM to 5:00 PM.</p>
<h3>Japanese Sailors Stranded in Shanghai to Board Ship for Return to Japan Today</h3>
<p>After the Customs dredged the Huangpu River, the 76 Japanese sailors and one captain who came to Shanghai with the ship were requested by the Dredging Bureau to be sent back to Japan by the Port Transportation Command. However, the last repatriation ship had already departed Shanghai on the 11th of this month, leaving the repatriation of this group of Japanese sailors problematic, and they were stranded in Zhanghuabang. Later, a request was telegraphed to MacArthur, and a small destroyer was dispatched from Japan to Shanghai to carry the stranded Japanese sailors. The ship has now arrived in Shanghai and will set sail for Japan today.</p>
<h3>Transportation Technical Personnel to Go to Beijing After Returning Home</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent] The 231 road, electrical, postal, and aviation personnel sent to the United States for training by the Ministry of Transportation have completed their studies and returned to China, arriving in Shanghai at 6:00 PM on the 24th. They were selected to go to the United States last year after the victory, to study and train in railways, postal services, telecommunications, highways, shipping, etc. for nearly a year. They have gained a lot of knowledge and skills in the latest European and American transportation. Various agencies of the Ministry of Transportation in Shanghai, such as the Two Roads Administration, the Shanghai Office of the Highway Administration, and the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Public Works, gave them a warm reception. It is reported that all personnel will go to Beijing at the end of this month to report to the Ministry of Transportation. The principle is to restore the positions they held when they were sent out, but the specifics will be determined by the Ministry of Transportation after they report to Beijing.</p>
<h3>Urging Reports of Wartime Public and Private Losses</h3>
<p>During the War of Resistance, the casualties and losses of public and private property nationwide were appalling. These are blood debts that should be compensated by those responsible. It is learned that the Executive Yuan's Compensation Investigation Committee is responsible for investigating the losses of population and property nationwide, and has instructed provincial and municipal governments to conduct detailed investigations and report them. The Shanghai Municipal Government had already issued a notice and instructed subordinate departments to investigate and report. However, many organs, organizations, industrial and commercial circles, and individuals in the city have submitted loss reports, and they are being compiled and statistically analyzed. Now, the Municipal Government has received an urgent telegram from the Executive Yuan's Compensation Investigation Committee, urging them to report within a time limit, and has ordered them to step up their work and complete the report before August 15th. If any sectors have suffered wartime losses and have not yet reported them, they can still supplement their reports before the deadline; otherwise, they will no longer be included in the compilation.</p>
<h3>Lack of Raw Materials and High Interest Rates: Severe Crisis in the Handkerchief Industry</h3>
<p>Industry Association Hosts News Media to Report</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent] The Shanghai Handkerchief Weaving Industry Association held a reception for the local news media at its association headquarters at 3:00 PM yesterday. Xu Zixin, manager of the Hanyang Handkerchief Factory, and Cai Ruomin, manager of the Wanxiang Handkerchief Factory, reported on the severe crisis facing the handkerchief factories. They stated that the domestic handkerchief weaving industry is centered in Shanghai, with very little production elsewhere. There are currently 72 handkerchief factories in the city, but if politics and the economy do not get on track, it is predicted that half of them will close down within the next few months, because even if there are factories, machines, and employees, there is still no hope of starting work. The reasons are fivefold: too high interest rates, lack of raw materials, declining sales, too heavy taxation, and unreasonable labor relations. Mr. Cai finally stated: The handkerchief weaving industry is now at its wit's end, and they hope that all sectors can sympathize and provide assistance, otherwise they will be forced to suspend operations voluntarily.</p>
<h3>Xie Baosheng, Not Entirely Without Merit, Sentenced to Two and a Half Years, Thanks the Court, Claims He Disagrees and Will Appeal</h3>

<p>Xie is a "celebrity" in Shanghai's underworld, running businesses such as the Xianle Dance Palace, the Kade Bathhouse, and the Xinzha Hotel. He is also known as "Ma Fu Baosheng" (Groom Baosheng) because he used to trade horses in the Northeast. Yesterday morning, after reading the verdict, the presiding judge explained to the defendant that because he had some merit in resisting the Japanese, his sentence was reduced by half. If he disagreed, he could apply to the Supreme Court for review within ten days of receiving the judgment. Xie heard the sentence and said "Thank you" to the court, but also claimed that he disagreed and would appeal.</p>
<p>Yang Guangzheng Sentenced to Three Years</p>
<p>Also sentenced yesterday morning was Yang Guangzheng, director of the Shanghai branch of the "Sino-Japanese Cultural Association," to three years of imprisonment and deprivation of civil rights for three years. Chen Fenghao, the puppet Baozhang (local head) of Junwang Township in Taixian County, was sentenced to two and a half years of imprisonment. Former Finnish Consul in Shanghai, Hama Ke, was found not guilty due to insufficient evidence.</p>
<p>Two Cases Scheduled for Sentencing</p>
<p>On the same day, the cases of Shen Weiya, chairman of the puppet Shanghai Edible Oil Industry Association, and Ma Le, an informant for the Suzhou enemy gendarmerie, were concluded and scheduled for sentencing at 9:30 AM on the 31st of this month. In addition, the cases of Du Li, a grain procurement officer for the puppet General Power Company in Bengbu, and his translator Lu Falang, were postponed for further questioning.</p>
<h3>Impersonating Police Officers, Seizing Newspapers and Magazines, Clearly Sabotage</h3>
<p>At around 11:00 AM yesterday, three people suddenly arrived in a car next to a certain newsstand, jumped out of the car, and, impersonating police officers, forcibly took away the English-language "Free Forum Newspaper," "Millers Review," and the Chinese-language magazines "Democracy" and "Jianwen Weekly," claiming that they were "confiscated under orders." After the police were notified, they sent officers to investigate, but the three people had already escaped without a trace. According to Director Xuan of the Police Bureau, this was clearly sabotage by unscrupulous traitors, attempting to achieve their conspiracies. He added that when police officers perform their duties, they must carry identification documents. In the future, if the same situation occurs, it is hoped that citizens will cooperate and assist, and immediately hand over such unscrupulous elements to the police for punishment according to law.</p>
<h3>Beijing-Shanghai Special Express Telegrams Limited to Three Hours</h3>

<h3>Active Flood Prevention Work in Western Shanghai Being Carried Out by the Bureau of Public Works</h3>
<p>Shanghai often suffers from flooding after heavy rains, especially in the western part of the city. The Fourth District Engineering Office of the Bureau of Public Works had proposed a fundamental solution, designing an entire sewer system, but it requires a huge amount of money, about 330 billion yuan. Considering the current financial situation of the Municipal Government, it is not easy to do so in a short time. Therefore, only the most urgent and critical projects that cannot be delayed are being actively carried out. The projects currently underway are: Dredging the east and west Keham of Jiangsu Road, including all of Ham numbers 9, 10, 11, and 14, and part of Ham numbers 5, 6, 7, and 12. Dredging Ham number 15, that is, the section of Fahua Ham north of Zhengxi Road, removing sludge. Dredging projects for Ham numbers 1, 2, and 5. The next priority is the arrangement of drainage pipes at the intersection of Jiangsu Road and Changning Road. The replacement of 15-inch drainage pipes in Wangjia Lane on Zhengxi Road, and the replacement of two 3-inch diameter drainage pipes on the east side of the Gongda Yarn Factory on Yuyao Road, totaling 331 meters in length, have been successively carried out. In addition, the road surface in the Kangding Road area is low-lying. For a permanent solution, in addition to the simultaneous dredging and pipe connection projects, the road surface in that area has been raised by 784 square meters, and 170 meters of curb stones have been added. This project started on the 17th of this month. Unless there are other special circumstances, all of the above will be completed by the end of August.</p>
<h3>General Gordon to Set Sail This Afternoon</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent] The General Gordon, managed by the American President Lines, was announced by the company yesterday that it will set sail earlier at 2:00 PM this afternoon to Hong Kong, Singapore, Little Luzon, and Mumbai.

<h3>A Meeting with "Double Gun" Ma Kun: Heroic, Enthusiastic, and Speaks Frankly, Always Followed Premier Sun, Dedicated to Revolutionary Work</h3>
<p>"Premier Sun is truly a great man, a heroic warrior!" General Ma Kun (pictured) said with emotion. Although he repeatedly stated on the phone that he had nothing to say, so there was really no need to interview him, but when Premier Sun was mentioned, excitement finally shone in his eyes.</p>
<p>The "Ma" in "Ma Kun" is Morris, and "Kun" is Cohen. General Ma Kun is also the well-known "Double Gun Ma Kun" ("Two Gun" Cohen). This is an extraordinary nickname, and what this nickname represents is also an extraordinary character: heroic, enthusiastic, and speaks frankly, without any hesitation. Since 1908, he has followed Premier Sun, dedicating himself to the revolution against the Manchus. This time when he came to Shanghai, his hair was already completely white, but he was still vigorous and full of rosy complexion. Looking at his energetic appearance, it is really hard to tell that he is already an old man in his sixties.</p>
<p>He said that since meeting Premier Sun in Canada in 1908, he had never left the Premier. "I often stayed by the Premier's side, watching him work hard to organize those speeches, often accompanying him late into the night. He went to many places to speak, and I was always by his side. Even when he passed away, I was still with him." His voice gradually became serious: "Afterwards, I escorted his remains all the way to the place where they are now enshrined."</p>
<p>He stood up and paced back and forth on the thick carpet, then suddenly turned around, stood still, and said, "But, I will never forget what the Premier said to me not long before his death. He said that our Kuomintang has succeeded in overthrowing the Manchus, but we should also establish a government that is better than the Qing Dynasty, which has not been achieved to this day."</p>
<p>His words reminded me of "Time Magazine". Sure enough, on the small coffee table by the window, a gust of cool breeze was blowing the pages of "Time Magazine".</p>
<p>Ma Kun said that the Premier's words "The revolution has not yet succeeded, comrades still need to work hard" really refer to this point.</p>
<p>"There is another point that you should also tell everyone. The Premier said that China is a new country, so we can take the essence of the systems and ideas of various countries that are most suitable for China's needs, without having to imitate any one country. The Premier said that Columbus took a detour to America, but we can go straight there."</p>
<p>He emphasized the greatness of the Premier's personality. He said that after working hard, the Premier often went out for walks to relax. Whenever he saw poor old farmers by the roadside, he often chatted with them very kindly, asking them what their suffering was, and talked for a long time. "He didn't know that they were talking about politics, he was just sincerely concerned about them." He suddenly became excited and shouted, "I am a member of the Kuomintang. I don't care about left-leaning, right-leaning, or neutrality, I just think that the common people are the most important thing!"</p>
<p>Indeed, this "Double Gun General" is a very straightforward person, but to say that he is naive is probably not true. Perhaps, after being in China for decades, no one should be naive anymore? General Ma Kun does not seem to be a diplomat, so his every careful step made him very difficult, and the weather was so sultry. So, I happily shook his huge hand and walked out of that exquisite and comfortable room with satisfaction. (Ping Su)</p>
<h3>Director of Social Affairs Bureau's Statistics Office Takes Office, Plans to Compile "Wage Index"</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent] Cao Xiaodeng, the newly appointed Director of the Statistics Office of the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, took office on the 23rd. According to him, the work of the Statistics Office in the future, in addition to continuing the usual work of the past, such as organizing statistics on labor disputes, will be to carry out a great plan jointly with several public organizations in the city, that is, to compile a "wage index." Today, the Municipal Government's Statistics Office publishes a monthly cost of living index, which is really helpful for adjusting the wages of salaried people. However, how many times the difference between today's wages and pre-war wages is, there are still no accurate statistics that can be compared. As a result, labor and management are prone to disputes over the wage multiplier. If the plan to compile a "wage index" can be realized, then such disputes can be easily resolved. However, wages have various different standards, with thousands of complexities, such as the distinction between staff and workers, the distinction between skilled workers and professional workers, the distinction between beginners and experienced workers, etc. It is not easy to set statistical standards. Therefore, what Mr. Cao said is still in the planning stage. However, it is learned that once approved by the superior authorities, he will cooperate with organizations such as the Shanghai Labor Association to work together. Mr. Cao is a native of Funing, Jiangsu. He served in the Statistics Office of the Chongqing Municipal Government and taught statistics and other subjects at Fudan University. He flew from the wartime capital to Shanghai and has been here for less than ten days.</p>
<h3>Xue Jianqiu Accused of Being a Traitor After Being Released from Kidnapping, Falsely Posed as a Fellow Villager to Hide the Ransom Ticket, Captain of the Municipal Government Guard Corps Imprisoned</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent] The case of the kidnapping of Xue Jianqiu, which occurred in the Housing Allocation Committee a few days ago, and the process of solving it have been detailed in this newspaper. However, the process of how to place the ransom ticket in the Municipal Government Guard Corps is tortuous. The main culprit, Zhang Xifu, and the Captain of the Municipal Government Guard Corps, Fang Baoyang, are from the same village and have a close relationship. When Zhang, accompanied by the ransom ticket Xue Jianqiu, returned from the riverside restaurant late at night, it was already 12:00 AM. So he folded into the Municipal Government Guard Corps and falsely told Fang that two friends from his hometown had suddenly arrived, and because it was late at night and there was no place to open a room, could they temporarily stay overnight in his place. Fang replied that there were no beds here, and Zhang said that it was fine to sleep on the floor in the summer. Fang did not suspect anything else, so he readily agreed. Xue, because he had served as a secret agent for the enemy and puppet regime in the past, was extremely apprehensive and allowed himself to be manipulated, not daring to say a word. It is learned that Fang Baoyang was arrested by the Second Criminal Division of the Police Bureau yesterday and imprisoned.</p>
<p>Also, the ransom ticket Xue Jianqiu was reported by Police Officer Zhou of the Huangpu Precinct to the General Bureau, stating that Xue Jianqiu served as a translator for the enemy Mei Unit and a special agent for the puppet Zhuji Political Security Bureau in Zhuji, Zhejiang from 1942 to 1945. He led the enemy forces into Hengshan Creek, Beifeng Bridge, Zhuji, burning down more than 1,000 houses, forcibly seizing grain from the people for the enemy, and framing our underground workers. Zheng Zhong, the current Deputy Director of the Investigation Division of the Garrison Command, was subjected to his torture. The informant was imprisoned by him for 16 months, and his leg was stabbed, and the scars are still visible. The Municipal Police Bureau is currently conducting a rigorous investigation.</p>
<h3>Another Accomplice Arrested in the Dade Li Kidnapping Case</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent] In the case of the kidnapping of the child Lu Liangyuan from No. 12, Heng An Fang, Dade Li, North Sichuan Road last month, the Hongkou Precinct rescued the ransom ticket in the countryside of Nanxiang and arrested several accomplices. Another accomplice, Shi Qimeng (26 years old, from Qidong), the Fifth District Public Office of the Qidong Refugee Government, has returned to his original home. After being detected by Director Shi of the Kongkou Precinct, officers were sent to Chongming Mingxing Town on the 22nd to arrest the criminal and escorted him to Shanghai on the 24th. It is reported that Shi was once a pirate, and in December 1945, he robbed cotton boats several times in the Chongming area outside Wusongkou. The main culprit in the kidnapping of Lu Liangyuan is still at large and is currently being urgently wanted.</p>
<h3>Enemy Property Review Committee Approves the Return of the Property Rights of Three Silk Factories</h3>
<p>The Enemy and Puppet Property Review Committee of the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui Regions held its 110th regular meeting at 10:00 AM yesterday, chaired by Zhang Fuyun. Committee members Xu Ji 　, Zhang Zi 　, Yang Xiren, Hu Yunqiu, Xie Haoling, Xu Shihao, Chen Shouchang, Liu Gongyun, etc. attended, and the chiefs of various sections and groups of the handling bureau were present. The following were approved: The Second Factory of the Jia Rang Shou Company was transferred to the Materials Supply Bureau, the property rights of the Hua Xin, Yong Tai, and Long Chang three silk factories in Wuxi were returned, and the Qinyi Xin Paper Mill was put up for auction.</p>
<h3>Low-Rent Housing Department of the China Trust Bureau Plans to Solve the Housing Shortage: Building New Houses First for Public School Teachers and Civil Servants, Currently Organizing Enemy and Puppet Real Estate</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent] The reporter interviewed Mr. Jiang Liang, Deputy Manager of the Real Estate Department of the China Trust Bureau yesterday about the general situation of real estate in the city. According to him, since the victory, the government, in view of the serious housing shortage in various places, has entrusted the Central Trust Bureau to build as many new houses as possible to solve the problem. The city is already preparing for the plan. Once the supply of funds, the regulations on interest rates, and the methods of payment are determined, construction can begin in batches. The first batch will be houses for public school teachers and civil servants, followed by houses for workers and ordinary people, and then accepting commissions from private individuals and organizations to build more exquisite houses. Currently, there are many empty plots in Shanghai, although most of them are in Jiangwan, Zhabei, and Western Shanghai, but as long as there are houses, it does not matter how far away they are. However, construction cannot be completed overnight, and it will take about a year before significant work can be done. The main task is to organize the enemy and puppet real estate that has been taken over. This real estate is handed over by the Enemy Property Management Bureau, inspected and measured, and property registration is carried out, and then sold publicly to fill the national treasury. However, very little has been sold so far, and most of it is temporarily borrowed by various agencies. In addition to collecting usage fees, the bureau also retains the right to sell. In addition, for some properties that were originally owned by British and American people and were occupied by the enemy and puppet regime, after taking over, our side will retain the leasing rights for one year, and after the expiration of the term, they will be returned to the original owners.</p>
<p>[Another report] According to reliable information, the Municipal Government will soon take various practical and effective measures to solve the city's housing shortage. The content of these measures can be divided into two points: Reduce the burden on land to increase land investment profits. Although the specific implementation methods have not yet been fully determined, it is heard that the land tax and various taxes on land transactions and house donations may be reduced or even suspended for one or two years within a certain period. Encourage the financial sector to invest heavily in housing construction and provide low-interest housing loans. It is heard that Nanjing and Hangzhou have already implemented this. Because there is a lot of floating capital in Shanghai, if the funds can be shifted to construction, it will be the most active and effective way to solve the housing shortage.</p>

<h3>From DDT to the Seriousness of Fake Medicine</h3>
<p>— Chen Fangzhi</p>
<p>DDT is a crystallization of science and the number one hero in the victory of World War II. It was originally intended to save the country and the world, but in the hands of the Chinese, it has become a deceptive front, which is quite sad.</p>
<p>Recently, various newspapers have been full of articles about DDT. After reading them all, I can summarize their intentions into two points: first, to publicize the efficacy of the medicine; second, to expose the dark secrets of fake medicine. But I feel that their weight is not enough, so I am here to supplement some of my ignorant opinions.</p>
<p>The function of DDT is to kill insects, and its ultimate goal is to prevent diseases. Because most severe infectious diseases are related to insects, their nature can be divided into two categories: (A) Insect-borne diseases. These diseases cannot be transmitted without insect vectors; such as mosquitoes transmitting malaria, lice transmitting relapsing fever and typhus, sandflies transmitting sandfly fever, and phlebotomine flies transmitting kala-azar. (B) Non-insect-borne diseases. From a medical point of view, these diseases are not transmitted by insects, but insects can act as bacterial mailmen, spreading the bacteria everywhere; such as fleas transmitting plague bacteria from rats to humans; and flies carrying cholera, typhoid, and dysentery bacteria from filth to food. Not only that, when troops are camping in the wilderness, the bites of all kinds of small insects, even if they are not enough to cause infectious diseases, are enough to hinder sleep and cause skin diseases. Therefore, the US military used DDT everywhere in the South Pacific to wipe out all insects, which was a great contribution to improving combat effectiveness.</p>
<p>However, the function of DDT cannot be demonstrated by sloppy use. Its method of use must be chosen appropriately, and its dosage must be calculated sufficiently. For example, to kill insects flying in the air, the spray evaporation method can be used, but to kill bedbugs, fleas, lice, and other small things, dripping or injection is necessary. A small amount can be used in a room or a small group, but to kill insects in a large city, it is necessary to calculate a large amount according to its area and volume. This time, DDT was spread by airplanes over Nanjing, but the effect was weak, and gnats were still flying around the streets. Public opinion was not good, and some people even doubted science itself. This is probably because the method used was not thorough enough.</p>
<p>Speaking deeply, DDT is not a luxury item for the rich, but a necessity for public epidemic prevention. To prevent epidemics, it is essential to start from poor areas. It is not of great significance to the overall goal of epidemic prevention for wealthy people to buy a few bottles of DDT and spray them around. Therefore, the crime of unscrupulous merchants who use DDT as a front to cheat money is not enough to send them to the eighteenth level of hell.</p>
<p>The greatest danger of fake medicine is in mineral drugs, penicillin, Salvarsan, and Atabrine. Fake products can directly endanger human life. These unscrupulous merchants deserve to die ten thousand times. These kinds of drugs are life-saving drugs. Even if they are not fake, but shoddy products with insufficient content due to cutting corners, they are enough to endanger human life.</p>
<p>When I was in Chongqing, a friend of mine suffered from relapsing fever. He bought a bottle of Bayer Salvarsan himself, but it had no effect after being injected. Later, he carefully examined the glass tube. The lion imprint on the bottle label was exactly the same, but the half-drop of yellow liquid left after injection did not turn black even after three days, obviously containing no arsenic and being completely fake. The content of Atabrine and Plasmochin is often insufficient, leading to delays in treatment. The counterfeit Ding of Dajianhuang and the content problem of Xiaozhilong are even more absurd. It was prominently reported in the newspapers that China could manufacture penicillin by itself, but what was manufactured was a long-lasting liquid. This level of bragging can be called unfathomable. However, endangering human life is the same as murder. Where is the law? Where are the eyes and ears of the Department of Health!</p>
<p>I believe that this kind of medicine that harms people and cheats money is by no means a matter of social knowledge, nor is it the responsibility of a city's health bureau, but a legitimate issue for the central government. Because chemical drug testing, especially the analysis of drug ingredients, requires equipment and talent, which is definitely not within the capacity of a city in China's current situation. However, the central government's responsibility cannot be ignored. The ineffectiveness of the law, the deception of the people, and the chaos of medicine must not be turned a blind eye to.</p>
<h3>Morning Dance Attracts Crowds, Police Bureau Orders Prohibition</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The two establishments on Nanjing Road, East Asia Once More Building and Nanguo Restaurant, have recently been utilizing their idle morning hours to hold morning dances, attracting customers, especially loafers. Upon discovery by the New Administration Department of the Municipal Police Bureau, it was determined that this type of morning dance not only wastes the morning hours but also corrupts the social atmosphere. The heads of the two restaurants were summoned to the bureau and ordered to cease holding the dances immediately. The Laozha Sub-bureau in charge has been instructed to dispatch police officers to enforce the order.</p>
<h3>Children Prohibited from Entering Theaters, Police Bureau Approves Revocation</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Previously, the Municipal Health Bureau, due to the prevalence of meningococcal inflammation, requested the Police Bureau to instruct all theaters to prohibit children under the age of twelve from entering in order to prevent the spread of infection. Recently, as the period of the meningococcal inflammation epidemic has passed, the theaters specially submitted a request to the Municipal Police Bureau to revoke the above prohibition. It has been learned that the Police Bureau has received instructions from the Municipal Government to approve the revocation, but infants in arms are still prohibited from entering.</p>

<h3>Two Landing Craft Recruited for Commerce, Trial Voyage Successful</h3>
<p>The National Merchant Shipping Bureau received fifteen landing craft from the United States. Previously, because the internal equipment of the craft was not suitable for carrying passengers and cargo, all of them were handed over to the Jiangnan Shipyard for modification after reception. More than a month has passed since then. It is reported that two "He" class vessels, with a carrying capacity of 300 tons each, have been modified and were test-sailed outside the Wusongkou yesterday afternoon, with satisfactory results. From now on, it is expected that one vessel can be completed every three days, and the entire project should be completed by mid-August.</p>

<h3>Gambler Zhu Shunlin Sentenced to Four Years in Prison and Fined 100 Million - Expresses Willingness to Serve</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Gambler Zhu Shunlin opened gambling dens such as Huaming and Dasheng in Nanshi during the enemy and puppet period and served as an inspector general in gambling dens such as "Hollywood" and "Six Nations Hotel" in western Shanghai. After the victory, he was arrested by the authorities and handed over to the High Prosecutor's Office, which filed a public indictment against him on charges of treason. After hearing the case, the High Court found the evidence insufficient and could not convict him of treason. However, he was transferred to the District Court on charges of gambling. After two trials by the District Court, the case was concluded. The verdict was announced yesterday morning by Judge Ji in the Third Criminal Court. The main text stated: "Zhu Shunlin, with the intent to profit, continuously provided gambling venues and is sentenced to two years and three months of imprisonment and fined 100 million yuan. He also continuously assisted others in providing gambling venues and is sentenced to two years of imprisonment. The sentence is four years of imprisonment and a fine of 100 million yuan." Zhu Shunlin expressed his willingness to accept the sentence in court. It is reported that Zhu has accumulated a great deal of wealth since opening gambling dens, and a fine of 100 million yuan is just a small sum.</p>
<h3>Blinded by Greed, Apprentice Deceived, 200,000 Yuan Brought from the Bank Turns into Counterfeit Currency in an Instant</h3>
<p>Chen Xinliang, a sixteen-year-old apprentice at the Sansheng Department Store at 77 Liuhe Road, was ordered by the store owner Hu Shanhe yesterday afternoon to collect 200,000 yuan in legal tender from the Futaihe Money Exchange on Henan Road. After Chen collected the money, he wrapped it in yellow paper and carried it in his hand, walking back to the store. While walking on the sidewalk in front of 43 Shandong Road, a man of about thirty-five years old, wearing a black Xiangyun gauze shirt and pants with a Ningbo accent, suddenly walked over, bent down and picked up a green flowered cloth bag from the ground next to Chen. He then cunningly told Chen that there was money inside, instructed him not to make a sound, and offered to split it with him. Chen Xinliang, being young and inexperienced, was blinded by greed and fell into the trap. He followed the man to a farmer's lane in Yuantaili on Shandong Road. The man in the black Xiangyun gauze shirt and pants pretended to open and read the cloth bag. At this time, a man of about thirty-six years old, wearing a white striped cloth shirt and pants, rushed in and claimed to have lost a cloth bag containing 100,000 yuan in legal tender. The man in black hid the cloth bag behind him. The man in white stripes demanded to see Chen Xinliang's paper bag. Chen did not suspect anything and allowed him to flip through it. After reading it, he returned it to Chen. Taking the opportunity, the man in black handed the cloth bag to Chen, ordering him to leave quickly. Chen then left the alley with the bag, crossed the East Zhongzheng Road, and opened the cloth bag. It was filled with 500-yuan counterfeit bills totaling 100,000 yuan. He then opened his own paper bag and found that the 200,000 yuan collected from the money exchange had all turned into 10-yuan counterfeit bills. Only then did he realize that he had been deceived. He rushed back to Yuantaili to look for the two men, but they had already disappeared without a trace.</p>

<p>Civil Affairs Briefs</p>
<h3>Importance of Reviewing Public Office Candidates Civil Affairs Director Zhang Xiaosong Speaks</h3>
<p>In order to implement constitutional government on a regular basis, return power to the people, and establish people's representative bodies at all levels within a limited time, as well as democratically elect township heads, district leaders, and other autonomous personnel, the Central Government attaches great importance to the review of public office candidates in this city. It has repeatedly urged the wide mobilization of citizens to participate in the review, in order to prepare a large number of candidates. Because the more candidates there are, the easier it is to select outstanding individuals, so that people's representative bodies at all levels and local autonomous organizations can be soundly established, which is extremely important.</p>
<p>Judging from the number of public office candidates at all levels in this city, with a total population of 3.5 million, 362 official and alternate municipal councilors, 64 official and deputy district heads, 4,212 official and deputy district people's representatives, and 2,106 official and deputy ward chiefs can be produced, totaling 6,744 public office personnel. If we conservatively estimate an average of five candidates per position, there would be 33,720 candidates. In other words, at least 33,720 people in this city should currently participate in the review of Type A and Type B public office candidates. Since the implementation of the review in this city, only 1,320 have qualified for Type A and only 1,410 have qualified for Type B. There are 1,215 cases of orders for supplementation due to insufficient qualifications or incomplete procedures, which is far from the aforementioned minimum number of candidates, and is a major obstacle to the promotion of democratic politics.</p>
<p>One reason is that this is the first time that the review of public office candidates has been held in this city, and the general public has not yet fully understood it. Those responsible for autonomy should promote it more at any time. The second reason is that the general public believes that they will not participate in this election, so they have not submitted for review. There are also citizens from other provinces who believe that they will have to change jobs and have no intention of living here for a long time, so they are unwilling to submit for review in this city, which is due to a lack of understanding of the review laws. Because once the examination is passed, the permanent qualification of a public office candidate is obtained. If you do not participate in this election, you will be qualified to be a candidate in any future election. Moreover, you can not only participate in the election in the area where you submitted for review, but also if you move to other provinces and counties and obtain citizenship, you can also participate in the election in that area. The third reason is that the qualification certificates are lost, and it is impossible to obtain proof from the original school, the original service organization, and the higher-level organization, so they cannot participate in the review. The Public Office Candidate Eligibility Review Committee of this government raised this point for discussion at its seventh meeting. In order to take into account the actual difficulties, a flexible method of supplementing certificates has been adopted. It is proposed that Type A be allowed to be certified by the district office in charge, and Type B be allowed to be certified by the ward chief in charge. This method is now being reported to the Examination Yuan Examination Committee for record.</p>
<p>When district heads and ward chiefs are elected by popular vote in the future, a large number of candidates will need to be reserved. This government is mobilizing citizens to actively participate in the review in the near future, hoping to reach the aforementioned minimum number of 33,720. The methods are: 1. Mobilize all party and state organs, schools, and people's organizations in the city, and those who have Type A and Type B review qualifications can participate in the review. 2. In each ward in the urban area, at least 50 people must be mobilized to participate in the review, and in each ward in the suburban area, at least 30 people must be mobilized to participate in the review, which must be completed within a time limit.</p>
<h3>Term of Office for Jia Chiefs Set at Two Years</h3>

<h3>Director of the Social Affairs Bureau Explains the Reasons for Taiwan Sugar's Direct Allotment</h3>
<p>Sugar Merchants May Be Allotted in the Next Period</p>
<p>Director Wu of the Social Affairs Bureau recently explained the 7th period of sugar distribution by Taiwan Sugar Corporation as follows: (1) Reasons for changing the allocation method: From the 1st to the 6th period, Taiwan Sugar Corporation directly allocated to the Sugar and Vegetable Association, but the market price gradually increased, and public opinion was in an uproar, which was contrary to the original intention of stabilizing prices. Therefore, the Bureau negotiated with the company and agreed that the 7th period of sugar distribution would be limited to retail merchants, manufacturers, and cooperatives, so as to avoid manipulation by a small number of sugar merchants. (2) Hopes of this Bureau: This time, the Bureau is acting as an agent for the review of sugar distribution, which is originally of a trial nature. The outcome remains to be seen. The only hope is to stabilize the price of sugar and spread the benefits widely, which depends on the cooperation of all citizens in the city. (A) Retail merchants should sell the original packages at 81,000 yuan per dan according to regulations, and retail the unpacked sugar at 860 yuan per jin. They must not raise prices, change the quality, or hide the sugar without selling it. They should also post the approved price in front of the store. (B) Manufacturers of tea food, confectionery, biscuits, canned goods, and pharmaceuticals should reduce the price of finished products proportionally, and should not be complacent with the current short-term interests. They should look far ahead and compete with the low-priced imported confectionery and biscuits to maintain the permanent survival of the industry itself. (C) Hospitals and cooperative members should no longer purchase from retail stores after purchasing directly allotted sugar, so as to avoid unequal distribution. (D) Buyers of retail sugar should maintain order and not rush to buy. Taiwan Sugar Corporation has sufficient sugar in stock, and it will be distributed once a week thereafter, so there is no fear of sugar shortage. Moreover, the price of sugar distribution will not only not exceed the price of 76,000 yuan per dan in the 10th period, but may also be lowered period by period. (3) Attitude towards sugar merchants' petitions: Most of the sugar firms in this city have a long history and should be protected by law. However, after the 6th period of sugar distribution, the association stated that it could not fully sell to the retail market in order to make up for the previous shortfalls, and that the price of sugar in the 4th and 5th periods was higher and had not yet been sold, so the prices before and after had to be leveled out and could not be sold at the regulated price. Therefore, the Bureau had to adopt a direct distribution method. Now that the Sugar Industry Association has come to the Bureau to petition, it only needs to verify the sales situation of the 6th period of sugar distribution, and it can be fully considered. (4) Application procedures for sugar use in other cities: Sugar merchants from other cities who come to Shanghai to purchase allocated sugar should present a certificate from the local competent authority or chamber of commerce, which will be submitted to the Bureau for approval and transfer to Taiwan Sugar Corporation. The allocated price is the same as in this city.</p>
<h3>US Dollar Rises, Gold Price Follows</h3>
<p>Gold was initially weak but then stabilized. It opened in the morning at 1,885,000 yuan. Although the Guangdong trading firms were supplying, money exchange businesses seemed hesitant, and the price hovered, falling from 1,895,000 to around 1,880,000 before leveling off. After 10:00 AM, the central government distributed 120 bars at a price of 1,890,000 yuan. After that, the price remained extraordinarily stable. Later, due to the rise of the US dollar, securities firms also had to settle gold accounts for Saturday, and the price rose to over 1,920,000 at noon. In the afternoon, the market was even more deserted due to Saturday. As a result, the closing price was 35,000 yuan higher than the previous close. Gold ornaments also rose to 1,000,500 yuan. Silver ingots and silver dollars remained flat. There was no change in the underground money market, and the interest rate remained at around 1.2%.</p>
<p>Foreign currency was initially weak but then recovered. The US dollar was still uncertain at the opening, once falling from 2,500 yuan to around 2,470 yuan. US prices are still controlled, and the call for inflation is gradually declining, leading to more gold sales for dollar purchases. Due to arbitrage, there was also some buying for storage purposes. At noon, the price rose to around 2,530 yuan. The afternoon was quiet. As a result, the closing price was 45 yuan higher than the previous close. Hong Kong currency was also pushed up by 8 yuan, with the exchange rate at 545 to 555 yuan. Indian currency was at 660 to 670 yuan. The exchange rate for British currency was 8,700 to 8,900 yuan. Transactions were not brisk. The US exchange rate was mediocre and unchanged.</p>
<h3>Stocks Rise Then Fall</h3>
<p>The high prices of Chinese stocks were difficult to sustain. Due to the Saturday effect, there was some profit-taking before the close. There were more sellers than buyers in accounts, and the market eventually rose then fell. At the opening, the high price of Yongsheng Cotton Mill was 710 yuan, Meiya 4,900 yuan, Jingfu 290 yuan, Xinguang 285 yuan, and Qinxing 128 yuan. After that, the market gradually became smaller, and by noon, all prices had fallen to lower levels. Yongsheng was at 660 yuan, Meiya 4,280 yuan, Jingfu 250 yuan, Xinguang 245 yuan, and Qinxing 180 yuan. Trading volume had decreased slightly. As a result, Yongsheng Cotton Mill fell slightly compared to the previous close, Meiya fell more than 5%, and Jingfu, Xinguang, and Qinxing also fell about 5%. The medium-sized stocks that were relatively cold were flat, while the smaller stocks made some progress. The old stocks were also stable.</p>
<p>The foreign stocks were still dull due to the low volume of transactions. At the opening, Yisha once rose to 9,700 yuan, but soon fell due to profit-taking. The decline of Chinese stocks near noon made it even more difficult to maintain the price. For a time, supply exceeded demand, and prices fell significantly. Some even had no transactions. As a result, compared to the previous close, Jardine Matheson, Chartered Bank, Steel, and Paper were flat, while Yisha, British American Tobacco, and Aviation fell slightly.</p>
<h3>Public Debt Market Flat</h3>
<p>The public debt market was quiet. The supply and demand for each bond varied, and the market price fluctuated. Unified Type C opened at 730 yuan, fell and then recovered in the middle, reached a low of 700 yuan, and then closed at 760 yuan. As a result, it was 50 yuan higher than the previous number. Types A and B remained flat. Type D rose by 1 yuan, and Types C and E fell by 20 yuan.</p>
<h3>The Truth About China and the Soviet Union's Tea-for-Goods Negotiations; China Trust Bureau Handles Barter Trade Not Limited to the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] This reporter recently inquired with a responsible person from the Central Trust Bureau about the issue of exchanging Chinese tea for Soviet goods. It was reported that the Ministry of Finance's Trade Commission originally entrusted the Fuxing Company to handle the barter trade with the Soviet Union. After the Fuxing Company concluded its business at the end of last year, the Central Trust Bureau was ordered in early March of this year to continue taking over the Fuxing Company's business. However, the Central Trust Bureau's handling of foreign barter trade is not limited to the Soviet Union alone. As for the exchange of Chinese tea for Soviet goods, the government authorities have indeed been in discussions with the Soviet Union's Commercial Representative, Mr. Shulaev. However, since the quantity and price have not yet been agreed upon, a contract has not yet been signed. If a contract is signed in the future, and the government needs to entrust the Central Trust Bureau to purchase tea leaves, it will also plan to make comprehensive purchases in the production areas, rather than sporadically searching for them in the market. Furthermore, since the beginning of this year, the Bureau has also accepted commissions from the Resources Committee, the Ministry of Communications, China Silk Company, and others to handle barter trade with the Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers in Japan for coal and iron from Huainan, and etc. The transaction materials that our country exports are salt and bran. The transaction materials imported by the Allied Supreme Command include copper, various equipment, railway vehicle materials, sleepers, silkworm eggs, mulberry seeds, etc. To date, the amount of barter trade is not large. However, railway materials account for the majority.</p>
<h3>Sluggish Yarn and Cotton Trade</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the yarn market was sluggish and unable to recover. The volume of transactions was rare in recent times. 20-count Shuangma yarn could still hold at around 1.3 million yuan, but small and medium-sized yarns could not sustain, continuing to decline by 20,000 to 30,000 yuan. 32-count and 42-count threads also dropped by 40,000 to 50,000 yuan. People's confidence remains extremely low, and the trend is still weak.</p>
<p>Yesterday, New York American cotton futures fell another 100 points per pound, with the opening for [illegible] day at [illegible]. [illegible] new cotton for [illegible] delivery was 29.13, and spot cotton was 33.06. All spot Yang cotton transactions in this port were suspended, because American cotton has been falling for four consecutive days, and also because of the Saturday relationship. [illegible] nobody inquired, so the transaction was quiet.</p>
<h3>Industrial Syndicate Turns Out to Be Just Hot Air</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] A certain news agency recently reported that major commercial banks in this city will organize a large-scale industrial investment syndicate. This reporter inquired with several leading figures in the commercial banking sector in this city about this news, and they all said that they had not heard of this matter.</p>
<h3>China Tobacco Can Barely Maintain; Average Monthly Production of Approximately 5,000 Cases; Wholesale Price Has Risen 10% Since the Beginning of the Year</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] This reporter recently visited the Ministry of Economic Affairs-administered China Tobacco Company to inquire about the recent production situation. It was learned that after the company took over the original China Tobacco Factories No. 1, No. 2, and No. 3, it immediately started operations at Factories No. 1 and No. 2. On average, about 40 [illegible] cigarette machines are started each day, with an average monthly production of about 5,000 cases. This includes the Quanlu, Shuangfu, and Zhinan brands. The delivery price at the beginning of this year was about 300,000 yuan per case, and recently it has been about 400,000 yuan, an increase of just over 10%. Taking the Quanlu brand as an example, the retail price per small package (20 cigarettes) is about 200 yuan. Based on the current cost of raw materials and labor, it is not expected to result in deficits, but it is no longer possible to make profit.</p>
<h3>Rice, Sugar, and Salt All Arrived Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The main food staples such as rice and sugar continue to arrive. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Jianghan ship arrived in the port yesterday morning with 1,000 tons of Sichuan rice from Yichang. The Haiwan ship also imported 1,000 tons of sugar from Keelung, Taipei, yesterday. Also, the Haikang ship arrived in Shanghai yesterday from Lianyungang, carrying 1,900 tons of salt. The salt was originally to be transported to Bengbu, but due to the recent interruption of the Longhai Railway, it was changed to be transported by sea, and then transferred to Pukou for loading onto trains to Bengbu.</p>
<h3>Rice Market Firm and High, Secondary Stagnant; Oil Prices Not Allowed to Rise Further</h3>
<p>Yesterday, over 7,000 piculs of rice arrived in the north and south markets. The market for high-quality goods was brisk, and prices were firm. The middle and lower grades were still lacking in transactions and lacked vitality. There was slight interest in high-quality glutinous rice, but the middle and lower grades had no inquiries. Baiyuan stores are selecting and purchasing high-quality rice, but there are still few transactions in middle and secondary grades. Flour retail was brisk, rising by 300 to 400 yuan. Factories are reluctant to open. Retailers are still picking high-quality wheat, and there are still transactions in high-quality goods, with prices firm, up by 300 to 400 yuan. Transactions in middle and secondary grades are still scarce. Bran is selling well in rural areas, continuing to rise by 300 to 400 yuan. Soybeans are balanced between arrival and sales, and the market is firm and stable. Most of the new soybeans are being used to make bean curd, and arrivals are sporadic, being sold as they arrive, with no changes for the time being. Soybean cake is in peak season during the hot summer, and although sellers are firm, sales are not very brisk, with prices rising slightly by 100 to 200 yuan. The Oil Association was instructed by the Social Affairs Bureau today that oil prices can only be lowered in the future and cannot be raised further. Since there were not many goods arriving from Qingdao, no trading was done.</p>
<h3>Number of Brokerages Passing Preliminary Review Will Not Exceed 500</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The preliminary sorting work by the securities exchange preparatory committee's subcommittee for reviewing the qualifications of brokers is about to be completed within the next few days. It is heard that the number of those who smoothly pass the preliminary sorting will not exceed 500. It is expected that a full preparatory committee meeting will be convened around next Tuesday to conduct a thorough review of the brokers who have passed the preliminary sorting. It is estimated that in another week or so, the list of brokers can be submitted to the Ministry for verification.</p>
<h3>Central Government Takes Over Cocoon Loans; Interest Rate Reduced to 1.8%</h3>
<p>The Central Bank has decided to take over the spring cocoon loan syndicate. Starting on August 1st, all of the syndicate's debts will be transferred to the bank for processing. As of now, the syndicate's funds used for lending amount to 16.9 billion yuan, and the lending units include the China Silk Company, totaling 53 companies. The borrowers were all recommended by [illegible]. The interest rate for fixed guarantees and mortgages was 4.5%. After the Central Bank takes over, it will be reduced to 1.8%. With such low-interest loans, costs can be reduced.</p>
<h3>Severity of Returned Checks Not as Bad as Reported; Usually Around 2-3 Billion</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] According to news from the Shanghai Clearing House, the total number of checks exchanged by the House in recent days has averaged over 50,000 per day. The total amount exchanged has averaged over 130 billion yuan per day. The number of returned checks has averaged over 1,500 per day, with the amount averaging 2 to 3 billion yuan per day. At the end of June, the market was somewhat tight due to the settlement of accounts by the banking industry. However, the highest amount of returned checks was only over 14 billion yuan, and that was only on June 29th. The percentage of returned checks and amounts to the total amount exchanged is extremely small, indicating that the overall financial situation is quite stable.</p>
<h3>Reorganization of the Clearing House Awaiting Approval from the Ministry of Finance</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] It is learned that the Shanghai Clearing House will undergo a partial reorganization. The new organization after the reorganization will be a clearing house purely organized by commercial banks and money shops, and its nature will be a completely independent institution. It is heard that it is currently awaiting approval from the Ministry of Finance, and it can be reorganized and established as soon as it is approved. The current Clearing House was originally entrusted by the Central Bank and began handling the check exchange business of the city's financial industry on November 1st of last year. To date, 175 banks and money shops have participated in the House.</p>
<h3>Tallow Slightly Improves</h3>
<p>***</p>
<h3>Wood-Oil Sold for 88,000</h3>
<p>Tallow prices were slightly depressed last week due to the impact of tight money, but soap factories are in high demand, and there is also demand from yarn factories, so sales are in season. Recently, the supply from Zhejiang has gradually become scarce, so the goods in stock by local merchants in this city can only be sold tightly. As a result, the market has returned to the state it was half a month ago, and even surpassed it. This is especially true for wood-oil. It is heard that in Jiaxing and other places, it has been sold for over 80,000. The selling price in this city also has to be increased accordingly. The prices are: Heben tallow 88,000 yuan, Neiping tallow 82,000 yuan, Duque tallow 76,000 yuan, Degan tallow 76,000 yuan, Ordinary [illegible] tallow 71,000 yuan, and Macheng tallow 70,000 yuan.</p>

<h3>The North Coast of Qiantang River</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent Chu Yusheng Reports from Hangzhou on the 10th of this Month</p>
<p>The north coast of the Qiantang River refers to Zhapu, Haiyan, and Haining, which is the famous Hangzhou Bay in geography. The eastern major port planned by the Founding Father is also located between Ganpu and Zhapu. The residents here live by the sea, either by boiling salt or fishing. However, they are not the majority in the population, because as long as there is a little soil, it is very fertile and can be cultivated for self-sufficiency. The reporter got an opportunity to investigate the coastal areas and the seawall that is undergoing urgent accelerated repairs.</p>
<p>Muddy Road</p>
<p>On this day, the new rain had just cleared, and the roads were still very muddy, especially when a car stepped onto this Hangzhou-Shanghai highway, it had a special taste. The bumping and shaking were so severe that people with seven or eight years of driving experience could not imagine it. The big pits and sections of muddy soil on the highway made it hard to believe that you were driving on a highway, but rather traveling in a muddy field. The people sitting in the car were thrown very high, and their hearts and organs were constantly vibrating. It is said that when Chairman Shen went, he used some tiles and bricks to pave a little, and Mr. Shen was sitting in a small car, but it was still unbearably bumpy.</p>
<p>Arriving in Haining</p>
<p>It was not easy to reach Haining. We made a special trip to walk around the city. Here, it was truly a scene of broken walls and ruins. Tall houses stood only with a piece of wall, a pile of broken tiles, and one or two charred wooden pillars. No more than two-tenths of the houses were intact. The county government borrowed a room in a civilian house, but when we went, the county government had already moved to Xiashi. There was only a county government office here. The county party headquarters had also moved to Xiashi. The county chamber of commerce was still here. There were a few shops in the city, and a little market outside the city. I asked the local people, and they said: "Haining is getting worse and worse. In the past, all the streets here were very prosperous, and many important people also lived here. There was electricity and newspapers, but now the streets have been burned down. Some families have torn down their houses to sell them, and many rich people who are outside will never come again." I asked them if the enemy had fought in this place? They also told me, "Did the enemy fight here? The enemy wanted to move the white stone lions in front of the Sea God Temple, but they couldn't move them, so they looted a lot of the equipment in the temple."</p>
<p>Children of the Sea</p>
<p>The people here do not completely rely on the sea for a living. The sea is close to the seawall and cannot be used to boil salt. When the tide is not coming, the sea is too shallow to fish. Only a very small number of people live by repairing the seawall, and the rest are mostly engaged in farming. We went to see the residence of the famous Minister Chen from the Qianlong period of the Qing Dynasty. Legend has it that Yongzheng had no son, only a daughter. Later, Chen Yuangao exchanged his son for the daughter and married the daughter to his son. This son was Qianlong, and Chen became the emperor's father-in-law. Seeing his majestic gate and flagpole standing around, we could still recognize where horses were tied and sedan chairs stopped in the past. We walked into the gate, which was also dilapidated. Chen also sat in Haining in the past to supervise the repair of the seawall. In the past, civil and military officials had to come to Haining every year to pay their respects or visit. Qianlong also came twice and inspected [illegible].</p>
<p>Sea God Temple</p>
<p>Then we went to the Sea God Temple. The magnificent palace architecture, the exquisite lions carved from white stone, and the two white stone arches outside the temple made people imagine the prosperity of the past. It can be seen that there is nothing left in the temple now, and even the Sea God doesn't know where he has gone. The old sites of the county government and the county party headquarters were also quite grand, but now only some broken pillars and tiles remain.</p>
<p>Some people say that the county government will be permanently moved to Xiashi, because Xiashi is a commercial center and a distribution center for [illegible] rice. Thinking about it carefully, this [illegible] is not quite right. In the past, the government's reason for establishing the county government in Haining was to control the seawall, because Zhapu has salt fields and Haiyan also has salt fields. The tide is not very strong, but only the tide in the Haining area is the strongest. Many seawall workers in Haining also say this. Therefore, Haining is actually the sea defense gateway of the seven counties of Jiangnan and also the protector of avoiding floods. In the past eight or nine years, the enemy and puppets moved the county government to Xiashi in order to squeeze the people's wealth, which caused the seawall to be neglected and almost caused a catastrophe. Now that the county government is moving to Xiashi again, this is really a matter worth considering!</p>
<p>Tide Watching Place</p>
<p>We also went to the tide watching place in Haining. There is a tide watching pavilion, a tide watching platform, and several iron oxen. The tide watching dike has a viewing platform that is more than ten feet long. There are ruins of parks on both sides of the tide watching pavilion. According to the local people, when the tide rises, there are really crowds of people here, and some even rent houses to live in before the tide rises. It is said that foreigners came to Haining to watch the tide. The pre-war legal tender spent in Haining was estimated to be over 10 million yuan, which is comparable to the peak seasons of West Lake in spring and autumn.</p>
<p>Repairing the Dike</p>
<p>We came out of Haining and arrived at the "Du Gao Zhong Li" dike in the east. The brushwood dike here is almost completed. The engineers told me: After the brushwood dike is completed, the collapsed stone dike in front will be demolished, and a new stone dike will be repaired this winter. We saw farmers, both men and women, old and young, carrying mud to make earth dikes and cutting wood to make brushwood dikes, working very hard. I asked a farmer who was cutting wood, "How much flour can you get every day?" He said, "Nine catties, which is worth only 300 yuan." I also asked the supervisor of the Relief Administration, who was supervising the work, and he said, "We give flour based on work efficiency. It takes seven catties to plant a piece of wood, and each person can make two pieces of wood a day, so they can get fourteen catties of flour." We came back from the stone dike and saw a group of farmers having lunch on the construction site, eating rice and a dish of pickles.</p>
<p>New Mud Dike</p>
<p>Arriving at the "Ying Huan Gong Guo" numbered dike, the newly built mud dike there was washed away. Then we went to the "Hui Han Hui," "Gan Wu Ding," and "Duo Shi Ning Jin Chu" numbered dikes near Chen Wengang on the Haiyan side. Some were moving to repair small parts of the unfinished mud dikes. However, according to the engineers, "The mud dike can only block weak tides, so a layer of brushwood dike must be built in front of the mud dike, and a stone dike in front of the brushwood dike, which is even safer. But now to repair the stone dike, rapid development is not allowed, so we can only get the brushwood dike done first." However, the large master's brushwood has not yet arrived, and the piles of very few brushwood are not enough for anything. And the fifteenth of July is coming soon, and we, the people of Jiangnan, should pay close attention to this matter.</p>
<p>Haiyan City</p>
<p>We did not go to Haiyan City, but we knew that Haiyan was also destroyed by the enemy near Haiyan. Most of the local people are still engaged in farming, and fishing and salt are also their side jobs. The same is true for Zhapu and Pinghu. I inquired with many knowledgeable people there, and they all agreed that the center of gravity of the seawall is indeed in the Haining area. If the Haining area is not protected, then Jiangnan will become a swamp. So I asked them for the reason why I thought Haining should be the county seat, and they also thought it was an absolute reason.</p>
<p>Car Overturns</p>
<p>On the way back, I thought about the meaning of "Jiangnan is rich, the world is rich," and people across the country should pay attention to the importance of returning to the seawall. How can we make the seawall never collapse and ensure the prosperity of Jiangnan? We should move the Haining county government back to Haining and engage in reconstruction.</p>
<p>When we were about seven kilometers away from Haining, the mud road collapsed, and our car overturned. I suffered a slight injury that didn't matter, but the chief engineer of the Seawall Repair Committee, Feng Dan, was injured.</p>
<p>Weekend Forum</p>
<h3>Save the Rural Areas!</h3>
<p>— Xia Gaobo</p>
<p>1. We Are Ashamed to Call Ourselves an Agricultural Nation</p>
<p>We have always proclaimed ourselves an agricultural nation.</p>
<p>Our country is located in the temperate zone, with suitable temperatures, and the Yellow River and Yangtze River basins are fertile lands, making them ideal for agriculture. Yu the Great managed the waterways and cultivated over 900 million mu of land. At that time, the population was just over 13 million, with an average of nearly 70 mu per person. Mencius said that during the Xia Dynasty, one farmer was allotted 50 mu, which was very possible at that time. Today, although the average cultivated area per person is not as large as in ancient times (details later), according to general statistics, at least 75% of the national population are farmers (some say 85%). Therefore, the phrase "agricultural nation" does not seem incorrect.</p>
<p>However, if we compare our country's "cultivation index" and "average acreage per person" with those of other countries, we truly feel ashamed to call ourselves an "agricultural nation." The "cultivation index" is the percentage of cultivated land in relation to the total national area, and the "average acreage per person" is the average acreage of cultivated land divided by the total population. Let's compare it with other countries in a table:</p>
<p>(Country) (Cultivation Index) (Average Acreage per Person)</p>
<p>Denmark 61.2% 12.4 mu</p>
<p>Poland 48.6% 10.0 mu</p>
<p>India 45.9% 8.1 mu</p>
<p>Germany 43.7% 5.2 mu</p>
<p>France 41.8% 9.0 mu</p>
<p>England 23.8% 2.0 mu</p>
<p>United States 18.0% 19.3 mu</p>
<p>Canada 2.5% 40.0 mu</p>
<p>China 15.4% 3.4 mu</p>
<p>We call ourselves an agricultural nation, but our cultivation index is far lower than that of industrial countries. As for the "average acreage per person," it is only higher than that of England; it cannot compare with the others. However, it should be noted that England's population density is also higher than China's, so the average acreage per person is naturally lower. Our country has vast land and a sparse population, so the low "average acreage per person" is truly unexpected.</p>
<p>According to a survey by the former Ministry of Agriculture and Commerce, the increase in abandoned farmland in our country from 1914 to 1918 is shown in the table below:</p>
<p>(Year) (Acreage)</p>
<p>1914 358,225,867 mu</p>
<p>1915 404,369,948 mu</p>
<p>1916 390,361,021 mu</p>
<p>1917 924,583,899 mu</p>
<p>1918 848,935,748 mu</p>
<p>In a country that calls itself an agricultural nation, the amount of abandoned farmland has increased by over 136% in five years. Although precise statistics are not available for recent years, continuous warfare, occupied territories, farmers leaving their homes, enemies looting at will, arson, and exorbitant taxes have naturally led to an increase in abandoned farmland.</p>
<p>In this light, it is no wonder that the import surplus of foreign rice increases year by year, and once foreign rice is smuggled in, we will taste the bitterness of soaring grain prices. We are truly ashamed to call ourselves an "agricultural nation" and are extremely apprehensive!</p>
<p>2. The Rural Areas During the Eight-Year War of Resistance</p>
<p>The War of Resistance seems to have spurred progress in various aspects, but it seems to be an exception for the rural areas. Farmers are the great heroes of the victory in the War of Resistance. The Chairman said in his broadcast speech celebrating the victory last year: "During the long years of this War of Resistance, the replenishment of troops and the burden of national war expenses have largely fallen on the shoulders of the farmers." The War of Resistance is victorious, but the farmers are on the verge of bankruptcy because of it.</p>
<p>First, Exorbitant Taxes and Fees and the Increase in Abandoned Farmland: It is undeniable that abandoned farmland increased year by year during the War of Resistance. Warfare and unrest made it impossible to live in peace, and rising prices and huge costs naturally affected cultivation. In addition, in the recovered areas, the enemy and their puppets exploited at will during the occupation, in addition to land taxes, there were Baojia levies, defense levies, "voluntary" contributions, military rations, departure fees, comfort fees, "Imperial Army" hospitality fees…a wide variety of fees, coupled with "grain control" and forced requisition of military rice, forced farmers to unwilling to cultivate. The Taihu Lake area, famous for its silk production, could no longer afford to raise silkworms during the occupation due to the high cost of labor, charcoal, and insufficient funds. They even chopped down mulberry trees to sell for money and eat. Furthermore, bamboo forests and mulberry trees were cut down because the enemy feared that they would be used to hide soldiers. In the free areas, there were also many exorbitant taxes and fees during the War of Resistance. Various public grains and military and political funds emerged one after another, and military rice was often forcibly bought at low prices. Naturally, the abandoned farmland increased. After the victory, it was expected that there would be a respite, but the exorbitant taxes and fees did not change. It is reported that in Xiaoyue Township, Shangyu, Zhejiang, the situation is as follows: Last December, there were items such as Allied Victory Public Bonds, special professional fees from the county government, old debts for military and public food, township expenses and public grain, raising funds to purchase military grain, the town's fund for purchasing equipment, the central national school fund, and training and expenses for the security team, etc. An ordinary household had to pay 972 yuan in national currency and 107 catties of white rice. This January, there were items such as military and public food for the 32nd year of the Republic, township-level public grain for the 33rd year of the Republic, the first phase of demobilization expenses, the price difference for purchasing wood for the Hao-Sheng highway, and additional gun purchase fees, etc. An ordinary household had to pay 1440 yuan in national currency and 104 catties of white rice. In February, there were items such as losses from purchasing military grain, military and public warehouse grain, town expenses, entertaining garrison troops, and purchasing non-staple food, etc. An ordinary household had to pay 84 catties of white rice (the amount allocated to each household above is calculated according to the number of family members). Of course, there were also expenses in March and April. This is just one example, but similar situations are common everywhere. The poor villagers cannot bear such numerous items and heavy burdens, but they not only dare not speak out but also dare not be angry. This is a serious problem!</p>
<p>Second, Crude Fertilizers and Lack of Agricultural Tools: The second serious problem during the War of Resistance was the widespread lack of agricultural tools and the crudeness of fertilizers. For thousands of years, there has been no improvement in agricultural methods in our country. The fertilizers used are still mainly soybean cake, human manure, animal manure, ditch mud, and aquatic plants. With the war, prices rose daily, and soybean cake and human manure were beyond the means of the poor. Animal manure was too expensive due to labor costs, and there was no time to collect it, so most farmers had to use ditch mud and aquatic plants. Naturally, the output decreased sharply. Many places have also changed to planting miscellaneous grains and vegetables because of this. The lack of agricultural tools is also a serious problem. According to Mr. Hong Ping's statistics in the Economic Weekly: "In Yi and other areas, approximately one cow was shared by two and a half farm families. Now, it is difficult to find one cow for five families. In the rural areas of Nanling, Xuancheng, Dangtu, Fanchang, and Jingxian in southern Anhui, there was one cow for every three or four families before the war, but now there is only one cow for every thirty or forty families." (See Economic Weekly, Volume 1, Issue 8). This is also a very common phenomenon. The reasons for this are: first, poor farmers have no funds to buy them; second, they are easily stolen. As for other plows, harrows, and waterwheels, they are too expensive, so people make do with what they have. In addition, labor is expensive, so cultivation is done carelessly. After the victory, everything was expensive, and prices rose wildly, so it was naturally not the time to purchase agricultural tools.</p>
<p>Third, The Gradual Decline of Major Agricultural Products: Mr. Liu Dajun once conducted a survey and compiled a "crop index" (which is the percentage obtained by adding up the area occupied by various crops in a year and dividing it by the total area of farmland). He found that the area of rice fields in our country has been gradually decreasing. The pre-war rice import surplus also suggests that this trend is credible. After the outbreak of the War of Resistance, the erosion of land, high costs, and annual decline in both the occupied areas and the rear areas were particularly concerning. In the occupied areas, the enemy occupied land, implemented grain control, and changed to planting miscellaneous grains and vegetables. The production of cotton in Pudong also declined year by year due to price controls, as planting miscellaneous grains and vegetables was more profitable than planting cotton. In the free areas, the average output was 352 catties, but after 1940, the average output per mu decreased to 265 catties. Cotton production also declined due to the control of the cotton market. Taking Shaanxi, the province with the highest cotton production in the country, as an example, the estimated production in 1935 was about 800,000 dan, but after 1944, the annual production was only about 300,000 dan. After the victory, although there was no more control, many other reasons have not been resolved, and the capital problem is even more serious than before, so it is probably not unfounded to worry that the increase in major agricultural products will be difficult to achieve in the future.</p>
<p>Fourth, The Disappearance of the Spirit of Thrift: Farmers in our country have always possessed the virtues of thrift, diligence, and hard work. During the War of Resistance, prices rose daily, and maintaining a livelihood and safeguarding wealth could not be accomplished by mere thrift. Farmers were not good at trading and did not expect wartime economics to be like this, so they suffered greatly. Over the years, the clever ones have long changed careers to become "shuttle traders," or work as "shuttle traders" part-time, while the foolish ones keep working to death, and that's their fate. In addition, due to unrest, exorbitant taxes and fees, and the daily devaluation of currency, what is saved today is not as good as what is spent yesterday, so life is difficult, but people do not pay much attention to money. In addition, since it is difficult to work hard, gambling and idleness are everywhere, and the steady and thrifty style has disappeared invisibly. Unscrupulous people take risks and become thieves; the ignorant are easily incited and are used by others. The current environment has not improved, and it is probably not yet possible to talk about reviving diligence and thrift.</p>
<p>The War of Resistance is victorious, but the farmers are also on the verge of bankruptcy. Although we are not worthy to call ourselves an agricultural country, it is a fact that more than 75% of the population are farmers. What a serious problem the failure of the rural areas will be! The proverb says that there will inevitably be a bad year after a major war. Although popular sayings are not necessarily to be believed, the climate in the Yangtze River area is warm in winter, with no snowfall, and the inland is not cold either. In addition, the various unfavorable conditions for rural areas during the War of Resistance have not been completely resolved with the victory, and the future is not optimistic. This is true. Without the revival of the rural areas, economic construction cannot be discussed, and becoming an industrialized country is even more of a dream. Therefore, we must raise this urgent appeal: Save the rural areas!</p>
<p>3. The Development of Agricultural Credit Cannot Wait</p>
<p>Looking at the current rural problems in China with a far-sighted and thorough perspective, to address the fundamental issue, we must of course start with solving the land problem. Dr. Sun Yat-sen said: "If we want to increase food production, we must enact laws to encourage and protect the rights of farmers, so that farmers can get more harvest themselves. If we want to be able to protect the rights of farmers, and how can the farmers themselves be able to get more harvest, it is about the equalization of land ownership....The farmer problem is truly completely solved, it is to 'tillers own their land'!"</p>
<p>However, the author's personal opinion is that the urgent solution is to develop agricultural credit in a practical way!</p>
<p>It is not to say that there is no agricultural credit in our country now, but that there is no "real" agricultural credit in China now. Talking about the past, most of our lenders of agricultural credit were individuals (farmers' relatives or landlords). Although there were pawnshops, they exploited too much. The interest rates were too high, so the loans farmers obtained were not for future development purposes, but purely for emergency relief, or even to save lives, so they were unwilling to borrow easily unless they were on the verge of starvation. Most loan methods were to mortgage land, and the loans obtained were not for future development, but for life-saving needs, so it was often difficult to repay after borrowing, easily leading to the land being sold outright after being mortgaged, so farmers did not dare to try easily. We not only dare not advocate this kind of agricultural credit, but also hope that it will disappear soon.</p>
<p>As for modern agricultural finance, it should be centered on the Farmers Bank of China. In recent years, the Farmers Bank of China has abandoned commercial finance and focused on agricultural lending, which is commendable. However, we dare not casually flatter its efficiency. First, the Farmers Bank of China's lending method is indirect. According to the bank's emergency agricultural loan regulations, the targets are cooperatives, farmers' associations, and other agricultural organizations, which then re-lend to farmers. Second, even if we acknowledge that the Farmers Bank of China's review of loans is quite strict, it has not paid attention to the actual use of the loans. Judging from past situations, the people who ran cooperatives in the past were not very capable. Village associations were mostly controlled by local bullies and bad gentry. Many unscrupulous people mixed in, used cooperatives and village associations to dominate farmers, and exploit farmers. How can loans lent through these people have good results! As for the truly cooperative comrades who develop cooperative side businesses for the sake of principles and the country, they are not only a very small minority, but also often isolated from farmers. There are also few who can truly go deep into the rural areas. Therefore, heroes have no place to use their talents, and loans lent through these scholars, although harmless to farmers, are also of little practical benefit. This is the reason for the failure of agricultural lending in the past.</p>
<p>Our government has also realized this drawback in recent years, so it intends to rectify and promote cooperative side businesses, pay attention to the increase in quantity, and also pay more attention to the improvement in quality. In the future, this agricultural loan transfer agency should be able to improve a lot, and the key to facilitating farmers lies in this. It is heard that the Shanghai Cooperative Treasury will soon be established. This is an institution that regulates and nourishes cooperative finance, and it is the central bank of cooperatives. We have great expectations for it.</p>
<p>It is certainly good if cooperatives do a good job in transferring agricultural loans, but unfortunately, cooperative side businesses are too uncommon today, and there are too few cooperatives in the countryside. A small number of cooperatives cannot complete this major mission. In this interim period, since the Farmers Bank of China itself realizes that it has not yet penetrated deep into the rural areas, the author's personal opinion is that it may be advisable to simultaneously invite postal remittance bureaus in various villages to transfer loans to make up for the current shortcomings.</p>
<p>The author has described many shortcomings of our rural areas in the previous paragraphs, among which the most important is that there has been no improvement in farming methods for thousands of years. In other words, agricultural tools are outdated, fertilizers are simple, technology is not refined, and seeds are not good. If this continues, tea, silk, and tung oil will not meet export standards, and none of the rice, wheat, and miscellaneous grains can fully meet the needs of the people. This is the most dangerous thing. Today, the Farmers Bank of China is not confident in directly handling agricultural loans, and indirect handling of agricultural loans has not been satisfactory. On the other hand, farmers everywhere are in dire need of help, and there is a famine all over the country. The stability of foreign exchange is completely dependent on the large export of agricultural products. Now that American experts from the Sino-American Agricultural Technology Cooperation have come to China, why doesn't the Farmers Bank of China make efforts in improving agricultural tools, seeds, fertilizer manufacturing, experimental planting, etc. to save the farmers in dire straits?</p>
<p>Our farmers have too little knowledge and too little financial resources. They cannot talk about improving agricultural tools, fertilizers, seeds, and technology. They are not qualified to shoulder this mission. It is most ideal for the Farmers Bank of China to launch this task. We should not expect too much and should not immediately think about fully mechanizing agriculture. We should improve step by step based on reality. Set up our own factories to manufacture fertilizers, and use the lever principle to transform the clumsy wooden waterwheels into iron ones, so that the old cows can also expend less effort while accelerating the water flow. Organize experimental farms to improve seeds and planting methods. The author has a friend who is an agricultural expert. He and his family cultivate their own land in Pudong, abandoned his Western-style suit, and went deep into the countryside. He discovered the poor quality of the seeds of nearby farmers, the waste of their sowing and the obstacles to seed development, their untimely application of fertilizer, their helplessness in the face of insect pests, and their neglect of the use of fallow periods. So he painstakingly taught them one by one. As a result, it was proven that the new methods were indeed satisfactory, so they were prosperous. These and those things, the author believes, are not difficult, and the effect is very high. Assuming that similar experimental farms for guiding farming are widely introduced into rural areas, and after truly integrating with the farmers, we can also use this to promote agricultural loans, lend them money, teach them methods, and rent agricultural tools to them. In the author's personal view, this is truly beneficial to the relief of rural areas, and this is a kind of agricultural loan that is beneficial to the country. If we use superficial relief methods, forcibly giving farmers in rural areas a few suits or even lipstick and high heels, it can be said that we are barking up the wrong tree, and the more we try to save them, the worse it gets. Farmers everywhere are indeed in dire straits. They need help, and they need this kind of real help!</p>

<h3>Tian Tarou (Tian Taro)</h3>
<p>— Chi Zhao</p>
<p>In late autumn, the west wind swept up the fallen leaves in the campus. Ever since I arrived here, the sky has always been so gloomy, with the rain falling in small drizzles: intermittent, drizzling, as if there would never be a sunny day.</p>
<p>Tonight, I was awakened again by that singing. Although I don't understand what they are singing, the tone, both tragic and desolate, always allows me to understand the singer's heart. The sound of raindrops drips in my ear, further stirring my thoughts.</p>
<p>Our school is a three-story western-style building, with a playground and campus. During the occupation, it was seized by the Japanese and used as a ×× facility. After the victory, we reclaimed a portion of the second floor, but the rest is still occupied by Japanese nationals awaiting repatriation. Among them are high-ranking figures, professors, students, small merchants, and more, mostly intellectuals. The school, fearing unforeseen events in the future, first sent me to oversee the school building. Since I arrived, I have become their master.</p>
<p>They always show a self-deprecating, polite, and submissive attitude towards me. When meeting or talking to them, they always bow at a ninety-degree angle. However, their silence, perseverance, and humility make me feel doubtful and fearful, especially when I think about the impression the Japanese soldiers left on me during the war: square, cold faces, squat torsos, and clumsy, heavy footsteps. The grotesque faces, crude behaviors, and painful memories involuntarily appear in my mind, and I truly feel like I am in the realm of ghosts. So, at first, I always kept a weapon under my pillow while sleeping, in case of an accident.</p>
<p>That singing mostly comes from a corner on the third floor. I know they often drink alcohol and start singing in the middle of the night. Every time it wakes me up, it causes me unease. The more I think about it, the more afraid I become. Several times I mustered the courage to yell at them, and only then did they fall silent. Tonight, I think I can't let them continue like this every day. Tomorrow, I must negotiate with Tian Taro and stop their nighttime singing.</p>
<p>Tian Taro is the leader of the Japanese residents living in the school. I heard that he used to be an important figure. Several Japanese people live in each classroom in the school building, but he and his wife occupy a large room on the third floor all to themselves. His wife is a White Russian named "Lucy Chuanzi." I think it is a strange Japanese-Russian combination of names.</p>
<p>Tian Taro has the typical short, stout body of a Japanese person, with a pair of small, shiny black eyes, and a mustache like a "Jintan" (medicine) advertisement on his lip. His face doesn't show much expression, and his smile seems forced. He is about forty years old. He can speak English, Mandarin, and Shanghainese. He also likes to drink alcohol and falls asleep after drinking, sprawling on the tatami like a confused person. But the other Japanese residents bow and greet him, every day. He never "drunkenly sings."</p>
<p>He sometimes gathers the resident Japanese, or groups of students, for meetings. They all seem to respect him very much. Although I don't understand Japanese, their contemplative and tense expressions, and Tian Taro's agitated and trembling tone, always make me feel suspicious and afraid. However, every household has a Chinese national flag hanging, and some even have portraits of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek.</p>
<p>The students living on the second floor spend all day quietly reading books. Tian Taro or other professor-like figures sometimes take it out on them when they are drunk, and the students always seem to be receiving severe lessons. When they say a word, the students bow and respond: "Yes," not daring to retort even once. Sometimes they even pull their hair or shake their shoulders, but they don't resist, which I find incredible.</p>
<p>I don't have good feelings towards Japanese people. I should press them to relocate. Because Tian Taro is their leader, I have more opportunities to contact him. He is always so humble and submissive towards me, his expressionless face always wearing a smile, which often makes me unable to get angry. However, in front of the Japanese residents, he is haughty and stern.</p>
<p>He once said that I was lonely, and sometimes invited me to drink alcohol upstairs. At first, I refused him several times, but later I couldn't resist his repeated bows, so we gradually became familiar from the starting point of drinking alcohol, and my suspicion and hatred towards them also disappeared.</p>
<p>In our conversations, I always wanted to find out Tian Taro's views on this war, but he always darted his black eyes and changed the subject. I also asked him about his prospects for our country's future, but he often looked out the window—the window was gloomy and raining. Once, I asked too closely, and he forced a smile and said: "You, people from Shanghai, called us 'Eastern gentlemen' during the war, but now you call us 'Eastern devils.' In the future, uh..." He paused for a moment, "In the future, I don't know how you will call us." His words really stung me a little.</p>
<p>I remember one time, an officer from the × unit came and wanted to use the school building to station troops, wanting to drive them away. Tian Taro rushed to find me. For the purpose of my arrival and the sovereignty of the school, I stepped forward and negotiated with that officer. As a result, because the facts were all on my side, and that officer was also from my hometown, he dismissed the idea. But when he left, he drove away their ×× facility's car. He came to ask me for help again. I knew that negotiation was a waste of time, so I refused him. He then said with indignation: "Your country is still like that!" I don't know if he regretted his slip of the tongue. Then he changed his face and politely chatted with me, which really made me unable to understand his psychology.</p>
<p>Tian Taro, in my eyes, is such a person!</p>
<p>The next day, I woke up, and the sky was still not clear. I took the opportunity to run to Tian Taro's room, wanting to negotiate with him about last night's matter. His room seemed particularly quiet. Lucy Chuanzi was also sitting silently with her knees bent, nodding when she saw me. Tian Taro showed his expressionless "smiling face" to greet me:</p>
<p>"Ohayo, (Good morning) ×-san (Mr.), please sit down."</p>
<p>I made small talk and told him my intentions. He said seriously:</p>
<p>"×-san, yes, yes, I will stop them, but they are also singing because they are too bored." His eyes darted for a moment and then said: "However, the order has been issued, and this batch of us will be sent back to our country the day after tomorrow." After he finished speaking, he handed me a cigarette and lit one himself, inhaling it wildly. The room fell silent immediately, and Lucy Chuanzi seemed even more dazed. I felt that the air was too stifling, so I excused myself. As I was leaving, Tian Taro broke the silence and said:</p>
<p>"×-san, tonight, please come to drink alcohol, will you give me the honor!"</p>
<p>After drinking alcohol at Tian Taro's place, I walked back to my room. The night rain was drizzling. I thought about the scene just now and felt a little lost. As I was cleaning up to go to bed, I suddenly heard a knock on the door.</p>
<p>I opened the door, and unexpectedly, Lucy Chuanzi rushed in, carrying a handbag. With red eyes, she said to me in English:</p>
<p>"Mr. ×, Tian Taro wants to drive me away, saying that he can't take me back to his country. Although he gave me all the jewelry and money, I am still reluctant to leave him, and where can I go? Mr. ×, please speak to him for me, thank you." After speaking, she wiped her face with a handkerchief.</p>
<p>I sympathized with her, and I walked out of the room. Everything outside was quiet. The other Japanese people didn't seem to be affected by this matter. I walked to Tian Taro's residence. The door was locked. I knocked on the door. At first, there was no sound. I knocked harder, and then I heard Tian Taro's reply:</p>
<p>"×-san, this is my country's and my own business. I can't take Chuanzi back. Please don't interfere in our affairs."</p>
<p>After that, no matter how much I said outside the room, there was no reply. I walked down and told Lucy Chuanzi with an apologetic attitude. She could only sigh, and we both fell silent.</p>
<p>"He has this kind of temper, and he is determined and stubborn in doing things. I also know that he doesn't not love me, but it's raining, where can I go at night?" She started to say, "Mr. ×, can you let me spend the night in your room?"</p>
<p>For fear of accidents, I had to gently refuse her.</p>
<p>"Then, Mr. ×, please help me call a rickshaw, okay? Thank you," she then changed her mind and said.</p>
<p>I agreed to her, put on my raincoat, and walked out of the school with her, carrying her handbag.</p>
<p>"Miss Chuanzi, where do you want the rickshaw to go?" I asked.</p>
<p>"Oh: this..." Lucy Chuanzi said blankly, "I also have no purpose. Let me think about it in the car, just please help me call a rickshaw, thank you."</p>
<p>The car came, she sat on it, I gave her the suitcase, she held my hand, which made me unable to remain silent.</p>
<p>"Mr. ×, goodbye, thank you," she said, directing the rickshaw driver to move forward.</p>
<p>Raindrops fell on my face, and I was startled to wake up. Her car also drove far away, and I quietly walked back to the school. Everything was still quiet.</p>
<p>On the third morning, it was still raining. Those Japanese residents were packing their luggage. I had gone to visit Tian Taro. The door of the room was ajar, and he was still lying on the tatami, asleep. The room was messy, and I didn't want to wake him up, so I walked down.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, when they set off to the assembly point, Tian Taro seemed to have come to see me on purpose, with a somber face and none of his usual smile.</p>
<p>"Mr. ×, thank you for your kindness last night. I didn't want to abandon Chuanzi, but I couldn't take her back to my country, and I gave her everything," his black eyes darted for a moment, "Mr. ×, you are here, you will always have a chance to meet her, you tell her for me..." He said excitedly and quickly, "In a few years, I will definitely come back to your country to find her."</p>
<p>Hearing Tian Taro's words, I couldn't help but be stunned. I felt infinitely ridiculed, and the bad impression that the Japanese people had given me surfaced in my mind. I was about to flare up.</p>
<p>"Sayonara" (Goodbye), Tian Taro walked out with his head held high, not paying attention to my attitude at all, and without bowing to me, contrary to his usual behavior.</p>
<p>I couldn't help but be angry, but when I looked at the sky, it was still so gloomy, and the rain was falling intermittently, as if there would be no sunny day, and I unconsciously dissipated half of my anger. I looked out the window again, and in the drizzle, Tian Taro led a group of people who were proceeding in an orderly manner towards their destination, without chaos or sorrow. It stirred up in my mind again that impression of "square, cold faces, squat torsos, clumsy, heavy footsteps..." and I couldn't help but feel suspicious and bewildered again.</p>
<p>However, the sky was still gloomy, and the rain was still falling intermittently. The sky has been gloomy for so long, and the rain has been falling for so many days, which is really depressing.</p>
<p>"Tomorrow, tomorrow it should be sunny!" I prayed silently.</p>
<h3>Summer Night</h3>
<p>— Ming Yi</p>
<p>If summer is a piece of prose, summer night should be a poem. Each night is a different little poem: lyrical, narrative, rational...</p>
<p>At that time, the poisonous flames left by the God of Summer during the day have been driven away by the evening breeze, the human voice gradually subsided, and the moon slowly came up. You may be lying alone on the vast grassland, subconsciously counting one or two... stars embedded in the sky, reminiscing about the past of childhood.</p>
<p>Or you have such good luck to have a close friend together. You shoulder-to-shoulder and hand-in-hand, slowly walking on the avenue lined with straight plane trees, slowly walking, murmuring your wishes. The dim street lights will never come to laugh at your infatuation. The road ahead is an endless plain, long.</p>
<p>Perhaps you are now sitting quietly in a corner of the night garden, silent. Schubert's serenade gently drifts from afar, reminding you of the life of such a young musician, regretting that his eighth symphony was never completed. Or when you silently recite Du Mu's "The jade stairs are bathed in the cool hues of night, I sit watching the Herdboy and the Weaver Maid," you turn around and ask your young friend, "Do you know which one is the Weaver Maid?" She shook her head, so you both looked at each other and smiled.</p>
<p>At this time, of course, you will not like to listen to the plaintive and resentful "Farewell Waltz", but its euphemistic and lingering melody after all stirs your calm heart. You say, "Let's dance"?—When you are dancing, you also seem to be a departing person who is about to go to the border, reluctant to say goodbye. You swirl, swirl, swirl... So, the heat of the summer night disappears in the endless lingering, disappearing imperceptibly like a kitten touching its toes. When she says in a low voice, "Let's go back?" almost everyone has left. You tidy up your clothes, which are slightly stained with dew, and stand up. The setting moon has set in the west, and the stars are also tired and sleepy. The dark night sky wraps the gloomy woods even tighter.</p>

<h3>Flying Together (98)</h3>
<p>— Zhao Qingge</p>
<p>Dong Shaoling also laughed, pinched Lihua's nose and said:</p>
<p>"Yes! I just like to see your smile often."</p>
<p>Lihua picked up Huang Shaoling's left hand and looked at the embedded watch. She hurriedly wiped her tears and said:</p>
<p>"It's getting late, I should go back." After saying that, she shook his hand tightly and looked at him deeply.</p>
<p>"I'll see you off at the station tomorrow." Dong Shaoling said, seeing her off.</p>
<p>"Thank you!" Lihua still smiled and nodded.</p>
<p>Dong Shaoling watched Lihua go away, feeling a little lost. Back in the house, he pondered over Lihua's every move just now, feeling that they all seemed to have a hidden meaning, but the impression was so vague. So he couldn't help but joke to himself: "A person who lives in 'drama' all year round is so used to being entangled and lingering, so don't be sentimental!" Dong Shaoling laughed to himself. He shook his head, clearing away his chaotic thoughts. He quietly picked up the book again.</p>
<p>Lihua lowered her head and walked out of the gate of the Huang Da Wang Temple, carrying a heavy mood, and walked out of Kaifeng, where the yellow sand used to fly! She looked back again and again! Looking back at the winding ancient city walls; looking back at the towering Iron Pagoda; looking back at the solemn and square Drum Tower; looking back at the dilapidated Huang Da Wang Temple; looking back at Dong Shaoling, who was always lying on the desk, handsome and bookish, enthusiastic but indifferent...</p>
<p>[Flying Together]: End of the First Part</p>
<p>When "Flying Together" was first written, it was originally thought that "flying" 100,000 words would be enough to "settle down", but now that 100,000 words have already flown past, the story itself has only gone halfway. The next half of the journey is quite bumpy, so I estimate that it will take another 100,000 words to settle down. This is something I never expected, because I am only a worker in the literary and artistic undertaking who hopes to express a little conscience. I have no big ambitions or ambitions! I have never dared or had any arrogant plans of hundreds of thousands of words in advance, but this time I unintentionally burdened myself with a heavy load of 200,000 words, making it "difficult to get off the tiger". It's a pity if I don't continue to write! It's a bit hesitant to write on! In any case, the first step is to bring the serial to an end. If I don't serialize it, I may still be able to write it down calmly. When serialized, my pen feels the unnatural pain of being spurred by life, and my mood is not as pleasant and relaxed as writing for literature and art. So, I decided to grit my teeth, give up this limited manuscript fee income, and end the first part of the novel as of now, and the second part will no longer be published!</p>
<p>"Flying Together" is a long and complex novel that I plan to write about the various social phenomena in several major eras from the establishment of the Republic of China to the victory of the Anti-Japanese War. The romance of thirty-five years cannot be written in a few words, but I have tried to simplify it as much as possible! I dare not say that I can definitely write this touching story well, but I dare to say that I am writing it loyally and simply in accordance with my conscience!</p>

<h3>The Knowledge and Morality of Film and Drama Critics</h3>
<p>— Tao Xiong</p>
<p>Drama critics and film critics are the bridge between the stage and the screen and the audience. They are also the audience's discerning eyes and the judges in front of the stage and screen! Just think: they bear such great responsibilities!</p>
<p>Drama critics cannot write about what Aristotle said "how, how" anytime, anywhere; film critics cannot write about "montage" in every review; because you need to know that the criticisms you write are not just for insiders, they are presented to countless readers, and these countless respectable readers do not fully understand the jargon. They don't need to know what Aristotle and montage are; they just need to know what's good and what's bad.</p>
<p>We often see critical texts blaming the performance goals of film and drama. Some even absolutely subjectively point out how it should be done. That's still wrong. A critic is just a fair critic, not a reviser. At the same time, he must know whether the scale of criticism he uses is suitable for what the play shows. If people are measuring rice, and you use a ruler to measure it, you can't get a result; if people are measuring cloth, and you use a peck to measure it, you can't get a result either; you must use a peck to measure rice and a ruler to measure cloth to get the correct conclusion. Critics must also stand in the position of the playwrights, directors, actors and all the technical staff to criticize, find out the shortcomings and mistakes from the purpose they want to express, and also point out their perfect things and tell the audience.</p>
<p>I have seen a lot of texts criticizing actors, only saying: "So-and-so performed very well", "So-and-so performed badly"; but where are the standards for this good and bad? Unknown. It is best to be able to cite examples of their strengths and weaknesses, so that others can see them at a glance, so that the critical text can be effective, and not waste ink!</p>
<p>Drama critics and film critics must have rich knowledge of film and drama; they must have unique insights that are superior to others. Because their responsibility is to point out the advantages and disadvantages of film and drama, both the concrete and abstract parts, to tell the audience the advantages that the audience cannot see, and to point out the parts of the play that have not been expressed to these artists, so that they have the opportunity to improve.</p>
<p>Drama critics and film critics must have high morals and an objective attitude. I remember in the 30th year of the Republic of China, a critic in Jiangxi criticized the actors on the stage, saying: "It is best to eat more aspirin before performing." This is too subjective and excessive. If the critic has a personal hatred with the actor and uses this opportunity to vent his anger, then the critic is not qualified to be a critic because he has no morality. To be a critic, you must have the same fair and serious attitude as a judge!</p>
<p>Critics are experienced old horses, and they must lead the audience to the right path; if the critic writes blindly, then he will lead the audience astray. We can't let the audience lead the critics!</p>
<h3>Stagecraft Talks (9) Appended Discussions on Color Perception</h3>
<p>— Wen Quan</p>
<p>Recent scholars have quite divided opinions on the explanation of color perception. People like Young, Helmholtz, and Maxwell all advocate the trichromatic theory of color vision. Hering, on the other hand, advocates the opponent process theory. Wundt completely denies both, establishing a stage theory.</p>
<p>The trichromatic theory of color vision originated earlier. In 1802, Young, based on experiments with color light mixing, corrected the old theory of red, yellow, and blue as primary colors, believing that the primary colors of light were red, green, and violet. His hypothesis was based on the idea that three types of nerve endings are distributed on the retina of the human eye. When the first type of nerve ending is stimulated by incoming light, it produces a sensation of red; the second produces a sensation of green; and the third produces a sensation of violet. When all three are stimulated simultaneously, a sensation of white is produced. Also, if two or three of these are stimulated simultaneously with varying degrees of intensity, then the sensation of all other mixed colors is produced. Later, in 1868, Helmholtz modified this theory, believing that the three types of nerve endings each have a specific color sensitivity, but that they are stimulated more strongly by certain colors, not that they are completely insensitive to other colors. The so-called primary colors are still red, green, and violet. Later, Maxwell used more precise experimental methods to prove the credibility of the primary color sensation, but the third primary color was blue, not violet. Most proponents of the trichromatic theory now follow this view.</p>
<p>In 1878, Hering published a new theory. His theory roughly stated that the nerve endings of the retina of the human eye are composed of various visual substances. These are categorized into three pairs. Under the stimulation of various incoming light rays, either a physiological dissimilation process (i.e., a destructive or consuming action) or an assimilation process (i.e., a constructive or replenishing action) occurs, thus resulting in various color sensations. The approximate breakdown is as follows:</p>
<p>Visual Substance Assimilation Process Dissimilation Process</p>
<p>First Black-White Visual Substance Black Sensation White Sensation</p>
<p>Second Red-Green Visual Substance (Cyan-Green) Sensation Red Sensation</p>
<p>Third Yellow-Blue Visual Substance Blue Sensation Yellow Sensation</p>
<p>Color sensations other than the above six are obtained through the combined action of these six. However, regardless of the color sensation, it always causes dissimilation of the first visual substance to some extent, hence there is always some sensation of white light. If the dissimilation processes of the second and third visual substances occur simultaneously and are very balanced, then the color sensations cancel each other out, leaving only the dissimilation process of the first visual substance, hence the sensation of white or gray. (Gray is the sensation of both assimilation and dissimilation processes occurring simultaneously in the first visual substance.) This theory best explains the phenomenon of complementary color mixing, and also explains the phenomenon of afterimages (i.e., after a visual substance has been subjected to one type of process, the opposite process must occur to restore it, hence the afterimage). Therefore, many people believe in this theory more.</p>
<p>(1) All nerve substances have two processes: excitation and inhibition. When the retina is undergoing inhibition, it produces a sensation of black, which is combined with the stimulation of an incoming light to produce various sensations of brightness and darkness. When the stimulus is removed, inhibition continues and the sensation of darkness remains.</p>
<p>(2) When the retina is stimulated by light, in addition to achromatic excitation, there is also chromatic excitation. The hue of the color is changed by the wavelength of the light, and the saturation is changed by the amplitude of the light. Since achromatic excitation is related to the amplitude of light, all color sensations have differences in brightness.</p>
<p>(3) The process of chromatic excitation results in a series of photochemical processes. These processes and wavelengths change in stages and tend to proceed cyclically. Light waves with similar wavelengths have similar chemical reactions caused by their stimulation, while light waves with different wavelengths have gradually diverging reactions. When it comes to complementary colors, the two reactions are opposite and cancel each other out. Beyond this limit, the two reactions gradually become similar again. The process of achromatic sensation is the same in this example, but the change in wavelength only makes its strength different, resulting in a linear change.</p>
<p>(4) Every light stimulus causes both chromatic and achromatic excitation to occur simultaneously. When the light is very weak, the achromatic sensation dominates, so it is seen as gray. When the light intensity is moderate, the chromatic sensation dominates, resulting in saturated colors. When the light is too strong, the achromatic sensation dominates again, resulting in a sensation of whiteness.</p>
<p>(5) After the photochemical excitation is removed, it continues temporarily, producing a positive afterimage of the same color. If the stimulation is excessive and the vision is fatigued, a negative complementary color afterimage is produced. Sometimes the recovery from fatigue and excitation repeats, resulting in rhythmic reverberations.</p>
<p>(6) After light stimulation, achromatic excitation occurs faster and earlier, and its decay is also earlier. Therefore, after a long time of any color sensation, there is a lingering chromatic aftertaste of the afterimage.</p>
<p>The phenomenon of color sensation can be largely explained by Wundt's theory. Wundt also believes that all sensations have emotions at the same time. Vision uses chemical changes as a medium, which can cause extremely complex emotions that cannot be simply generalized as pleasant or unpleasant feelings. (End)</p>

<p>Rita Hayworth, the star of "Cover Girl," has had a meteoric rise in recent years. Since completing "Cover Girl," she has also starred in famous films such as "Gilda," becoming a star in her own right. Her reputation in Hollywood can overshadow that of the old Garbo and the current Montand. Below is an interview with Rita Hayworth by an American reporter, from which we can learn about her life off-screen, or even gain a deeper understanding of Hollywood artists in general.</p>
<p>Q: When you're not filming, what time do you usually get up?</p>
<p>A: When I'm not filming, I often sleep until noon. I don't admit to being a late sleeper, because most of the year is spent filming, and getting up at 5 a.m. is very common when filming.</p>
<p>Q: What is the biggest expense for a movie star?</p>
<p>A: The cost of clothing. Whether I'm attending a broadcast or a charity performance, I feel that wearing a new outfit is essential. A movie star should look like a movie star, the general public expects that, and we can only do as they expect.</p>
<p>Q: Have you ever been discouraged since you started acting?</p>
<p>A: Everyone is bound to encounter times of discouragement. Nine years ago, when I was assigned to star in "Only Angels Have Wings," I was kicked out because my reputation in Hollywood wasn't as good as Loretta Young's. I almost cried about it!</p>
<p>Q: Are you shy in public places?</p>
<p>A: If the people around me only recognize me as an ordinary person, then everything is very ordinary. But when there are idle people, every move I make is their concern. I'm still a 28-year-old girl, inexperienced in the world, so in this situation, my natural shyness often shows on my face.</p>
<p>Q: Which performance do you think was the biggest failure?</p>
<p>A: Playing the unfaithful wife in "Tales of Manhattan" was the biggest failure. This role didn't seem to suit me in terms of age or demeanor, so failure was expected.</p>
<p>Q: What experience do you have in handling all household chores?</p>
<p>A: I started learning to dance at a very young age, and I stepped onto the silver screen at the age of sixteen, so I can say that I have simply never learned anything about household chores. Now I may be more advanced in acting, but I really admire the work of an ordinary housewife!</p>
<h3>Talking about Dance</h3>
<p>— Qian Zonglian</p>
<p>Chinese dance symbolizes Buddha, while European and American dance symbolizes God. The difference in the nature and form of dance among different ethnic groups is due to the difference in the objects they imitate. Later, because of social progress and the needs of the people, the nature and form of dance also changed. Up to now, European and American dances are roughly divided into two categories: one is stage dance, and the other is ballroom dance. Stage dance is for dedicated performance, such as Wu Xiaobang, Dai Ailian, and the four female disciples of the Wu family in our country. Ballroom dance is used for social interaction, and can also be called social dance. There are many new types, in addition to party dance, most are dances for couples.</p>
<p>In European and American countries, social interaction is open, and dance is a courtesy for social gatherings and banquets. For example, when girls from the middle and upper classes in England reach adulthood, their parents will hold a dance party for them, inviting relatives, friends, and prominent social figures to introduce their daughters into society and begin social interaction. In addition, when Europeans and Americans encounter banquets and receptions, they often hold dance parties to add enjoyment and to connect with guests, promoting friendship. Therefore, they regard dance as extremely noble and extremely honorable!</p>
<p>The current ballroom dance is roughly divided into two styles: freestyle and standard. The former does not adhere to any form or posture, only requires lively movements and agile footwork, and can be mastered with practice. The latter emphasizes posture, footwork, direction, and everything must conform to the rules.</p>
<p>The standard style of social dance is reviewed and approved by British dance experts. They have specific styles and reasonable regulations for posture, grip, footwork, direction, body twist, tilt, and rise and fall movements, as well as the coordination of rhythm.</p>
<p>Most people who frequent dance halls do not follow the rules, do not follow the rhythm, and just dance randomly. For this reason, freestyle dancers make up the majority. Even these people cannot dance to the standard of freestyle. Although we cannot criticize too harshly, everything must follow the rules. If you dance without following the rhythm, what is the use of music? If you dance randomly without following the footwork, what is the meaning of dance? Even if you dance freestyle, you must follow the rhythm and footwork, otherwise, you should not enter the dance hall, and the dance hall should be closed down! Because it is not a noble place for social interaction, but a gathering place for the vulgar! Leading pure and good young men and women astray!</p>
<p>I sincerely hope that the original intention of art can be promoted. At the same time, I hope that people who truly love dance must use an artistic mindset to improve the level of dance in our country! Do not let it become low-level.</p>

<h3>Formalism in Acting (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Ye Zi</p>
<p>The appeal to the audience is direct and indirect at the same time; it frankly takes the audience as the audience, and also as a kind of vitality of the drama, this drama is to be created jointly by the entire theater, stage, and audience.</p>
<p>By giving people's experiences to the people with sharper and more vivid blows, life and the theater merge into one, the audience is the actor, it is their own drama.</p>
<p>Beginning with the performance of "Dawn" in 1921, it is characterized by constructivism, the dynamics of dynamics, and simplified movements. The application of these two indicates that Meyerhold continues to engage in abstract constructivism, abstract scenery, which, in fact, had already been tried before the revolution.</p>
<p>Many critics of constructivism believe that it attempts to express the mechanical age in the form of scenery. This may be partly true.</p>
<p>Constructivists seek different metals, wood, glass with new usages, to express the purpose of its use, these elements were never used in the Russian theater before. Meyerhold valued the emotional effects that a certain raw material could produce, and the platforms and runways in the scenery of many plays were mostly built of wood and bamboo.</p>
<p>Using powerful movements with abstract rhythm to evoke emotions and convey ideas is as old as art itself. The primitive dances and ceremonies that originated in drama, in which the movements are symbolic, but their appeal to the audience is direct, is based on this. Mechanical dynamics is partly a return to that kind of art, but with modern interpretations derived from Taylorism, and improved by Pavlov's principles of reflex action, replacing the original power of emotion with the psychological and neurological original power of action, this attempt can be said to be new in the theater. An actor at the Art Theater once said: "I make these movements because my emotions force me to do so." The mechanical actor, however, said: "I make these movements because I know that by doing them, what I want to do can be done easily and directly."</p>
<p>Practicing the theory of this movement allows one to understand its characteristics, simplification, abandoning the complexity in the movement that he believes controls emotions, and finally he only needs "pure movement" that is unrelated to the traditional movements that express emotions. This is completely in line with psychology and physiology. When a person pricks his finger or sits on a nail, he jumps up, this is not because it is controlled by emotions, this is only a nervous reaction, nothing else, the tiger jumps, not in response to its emotions, but it instinctively knows that its jump can immediately get what it wants, observing this fact and behavior, Meyerhold discovered a new system.</p>
<p>This theory has acquired the abstract Marx theory in art—replacing the intuitive method of emotion with the practical creation of psychological functions. It is because of this that Meyerhold is close to being a revolutionary leader. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Reason and Sentiment</h3>
<p>— Shao Fu</p>
<p>Two children from a relative's family are studying at the same elementary school. This elementary school is known for its "long history" and "remarkable reputation," and the parents of students are all proud that their children can study at this school. Recently, the end of the spring semester has passed, and the autumn semester is about to begin. Old students who continue to study must register and pay fees. The school has issued a notice stipulating that all fees must be paid off yesterday. My relative was too busy with public and private affairs, and was occasionally careless, so he forgot this important day. When he remembered, it was already the next morning. He rushed to complete the payment procedures, but the school said: "You have delayed paying the fees, which shows that you have no intention of continuing your studies. At the same time, the school has already recruited new students to supplement the vacancies. Now, we can only regretfully inform you that we are full."</p>
<p>In fact, there were many people who asked to complete the payment procedures today besides my relative. Most of them were there because they could not raise enough money yesterday and came to pay today after raising the amount. However, the school officials, regardless of whether you were "unintentionally forgot" or "unable to raise funds," treat you all as "intentionally dropping out of school" and refuse to "make exceptions." When you waste a lot of words, and even say things like "Please help me," the final answer they give you is "There are many schools, you can change to another one!"</p>
<p>Listen, how much pride, contempt, and schadenfreude is contained in this light sentence!</p>
<p>Indeed, the school can freely set the payment date, but as the saying goes, "The law is unforgiving, but sentiment is pardonable." National laws must be based on the principle of not violating human sentiment, let alone school rules, let alone the payment date freely set by a school. The school can stipulate that fees must be paid on that day, but this regulation should not violate human sentiment. First, the deadline should not be set so early, and second, the opportunity for children to attend school should not be sacrificed as punishment. Now, I think it is a violation of human sentiment to refuse students to enroll because they paid one night late!</p>
<p>However, I finally found the reason why the school does this: it turns out that an old student only pays more than 10,000 in fees, while a new student, with the addition of many items, can receive as much as 50,000 or 60,000.</p>
<h3>A Motiveless Murder Case - Mentally Ill Criminals in America</h3>
<p>In a Chicago apartment, a woman was murdered in the bathroom. The killer left a message on the wall in lipstick: "For God's sake, catch me before I kill again! I can't control myself!"</p>
<p>According to the police, this is a motiveless murder case.</p>
<p>In the Chicago Police Department's files, there are two other horrific murder cases: a middle-aged woman in a black leather coat walked into the room of a 55-year-old wealthy woman in a hotel and shot her to death. There were furs worth 35,000 US dollars in the room, untouched. This is also a motiveless murder case.</p>
<p>A government official in the Price Administration had his six-year-old daughter kidnapped and murdered. The police believe that the little girl was immediately dismembered after being kidnapped. If it was for ransom, they would never have torn the ticket so quickly. Then, why was this little girl killed?</p>
<p>These crimes are all the work of mentally ill patients. American society is increasingly feeling the threat of mentally ill patients.</p>
<p>A famous criminologist said: "Maybe one of these murderers is your neighbor. One is the waiter who serves you food, or the guy in the car shop, or that beautiful woman at the cocktail party."</p>
<h3>Two Million People Suffer from Mental Illness</h3>
<p>Mental illness has become a widespread and serious problem. President Truman recently stated in Congress: "At least two million people in the United States suffer from mental illness; at least ten million people will need to live in a hospital to treat mental illness at some point in their lives."</p>
<p>If mentally ill patients receive proper care and treatment, at least 50 percent of them can be cured and discharged within 18 months. If left to their own devices, that person may spend the rest of their life in an insane asylum.</p>
<p>American judges and doctors unanimously agree that a comprehensive "anti-mental illness campaign" should be launched in courts and prisons. A small oversight may cost a great price.</p>
<p>For example, in a large city, a department store clerk, about 40 years old, stared at a woman on the street and followed her for several blocks. She felt annoyed and reported it to the police on the corner.</p>
<p>The judge fined him ten dollars and said, "I don't want to see you in court again."</p>
<p>Two weeks later, this clerk murdered two police officers.</p>
<p>According to a report by a psychiatric expert, "This person has severe mental illness. For a long time, he has felt that he is being persecuted. After he was fined ten dollars, he concentrated all his resentment on the police. He got a gun, and as soon as he had the opportunity, he shot and killed two police officers."</p>
<p>This clerk's mental illness had been around for a while, his brother knew, his landlord knew, everyone knew, only the people in the court didn't know. And when they found out, it was too late.</p>
<p>There are many examples of this kind. A prisoner, only 24 years old, was arrested 18 times, and released each time. In the end, he became famous for murder. If his mental state had been noticed at any time, perhaps this tragedy would not have happened!</p>
<p>Preventing crime and combating mental illness is an urgent and meaningful task.</p>
<h3>School Affairs</h3>
<p>— Xin Yun</p>
<p>Some people say: the way students spend money in elementary, middle, and universities are all different. Elementary school students spend all their money on snacks. Middle school students spend money on snacks and movies. University students are completely different, they save their money for dates with their lovers.</p>
<p>Walking into an elementary school classroom, all you hear is the sound of fighting. Walking into a middle school classroom, all you see are chalk pieces flying around, mixed with singing. Walking into a university classroom, all you hear is high-sounding talk, including politics, news, and love.</p>
<p>Teachers in schools, because their income from teaching is meager and they cannot afford three meals a day, resign from their teaching positions as soon as they have another job. Therefore, some school timetables have more than 30 lessons per week, but in reality there are only more than 20 lessons. No wonder a book that should be taught in one semester is only taught one-third or one-quarter by the end of the semester.</p>
<p>High schools with business majors are the worst for students. Without fixed classrooms, it's one classroom one moment, and another classroom another moment. And there are a lot of empty classes in between. It is impossible to ask students to prepare their lessons during these empty classes. And most of them don't have empty classrooms. So they all just play around idly. In terms of academic progress, the effectiveness is reduced.</p>
<p>Schools with boarding facilities, if you visit them at meal times, you will definitely be amazed. Because almost all schools provide their own bowls, so you can see some people eating with mouthwash cups, some with rice bowls, and some even with steel lunch boxes, truly a mixed bag.</p>
<h3>One Must Have Skills When Buying Secondhand Goods; Being Greedy Must Also Have Limits</h3>
<p>— Zuo Qi</p>
<p>Having walked Card Road, and after turning west onto MacGregor Road, one arrives at Wuding Road, a secondhand market as famous as Avenue Pétain.</p>
<p>The gathering of secondhand stalls on Wuding Road dates back to before the Pacific War. Because there were so many refugees, the number of secondhand stalls increased day by day. They bought secondhand goods from every corner of the city and gathered here at night for one last transaction, then took their day's earnings home. Wuding Road already had several shops that bought scrap copper, iron, and wastepaper bottles. Under this mutually beneficial situation, more shops opened, and secondhand stalls gathered here even more.</p>
<p>Gradually, some of the secondhand stalls set up shop here all day long, and business was very good. Because this was the passage from the bustling area to the factories in Western Shanghai, the majority of the bustling traffic consisted of workers and junior staff. The secondhand stalls gained the advantages of favorable timing, advantageous location, and the convenience of people, and quickly formed a secondhand market. Later, the things being bought and sold gradually increased, such as men's and women's clothing, furniture, kitchenware, clocks, and ornaments, it was practically like walking into a department store. They were also very good at adapting to the needs of buyers. For example, during hot weather, they sold mosquito nets and sunglasses, and when it got cold, they sold cotton batting, hot water bottles, and foot warmers. When the Lunar New Year arrived, each stall added many hot pots and candlesticks. Recently, they have also sold DDT solution and sprayers to meet customer needs. However, many people are afraid of being deceived when buying secondhand goods. If they don't choose carefully, they may be subjected to the stallholder's curses. In fact, buying secondhand goods only requires skill, and you won't suffer losses. The most important point is to first determine a rough price in your mind before asking the price and haggling. Often some people argue with the secondhand sellers for a while, and in the end, no deal is made. At this time, the more polite stallholders will start cursing, and the more ruthless ones will gather their gang and force you to buy it. Also, being deceived when buying secondhand goods is mostly due to being too greedy. There is a humorous joke about a countryman who bought a "Swiss Made" gold watch for seven thousand yuan, and ended up being scammed, losing both his money and goods. Although this joke is somewhat exaggerated, similar situations do exist. Therefore, things that are too far from the market price should not be bought, especially goods being peddled.</p>
<p>There are about a hundred secondhand stalls on Wuding Road. Around six o'clock in the evening, when the mobile stalls converge, the number doubles. At this time, people buying and selling things are piled together, which has a great impact on traffic and hygiene. However, because about one or two thousand people directly and indirectly rely on secondhand goods for a living, the police department has allowed them to set up stalls and trade under the condition of not obstructing traffic and hygiene.</p>
<h3>Although There is a Bus Stop, the Bus Doesn't Stop. Why Bother Having a Bus Stop?</h3>
<p>— He Ting</p>
<p>A few days ago, I had something to do and wanted to go to Hongkou. I originally wanted to ride my bicycle, but remembering G's tragic death, I didn't dare.</p>
<p>My house is on Avenue Petain, so I went out and headed to the red bus stop at the intersection of Avenue de Collery and Avenue de Sieyes. However, something unexpected happened: five empty buses in a row didn't stop, and there were only three or four people at the bus stop. But the bus just didn't stop, what can you do! Helpless, I had to walk to the Avenue du Roi Albert stop, and the bus still didn't stop. I was really angry, but being angry didn't help. Helpless, I had to walk another stop, to Route Ghisi. This time, I finally got on the bus, but before I could even stand still, the bus started moving, almost causing an accident.</p>
<p>Later, I heard people say: The Avenue de Collery is considered a small stop, so buses don't stop there. You have to run to a big stop like Route Ghisi to get on the bus. But this is really strange, a "stop", whether it's a big stop or a small stop, is still a "stop". It's a "stop" that the public transport company sets up. You can't make passengers walk a long and undeserved way because of the convenience of the drivers and conductors!</p>

<h3>Comic Strip: Sanmao Joins the Army (65)</h3>
<p>— By Zhang Leping</p>
<p>Serialized</p>
<h3>Sent to My Deceased Wife, Feng Jun (19)</h3>
<p>— Zhou Shoujuan</p>
<p>There is one more important thing to report to you, and that is that I have decided to rebuild our main house. Originally, when Zhenhou and his wife, Brother Zan, came to Suzhou to offer condolences during your forty-ninth day after death service, they saw me living in that three-room dilapidated wooden shed, and thought there was a possibility of danger at any time. In the autumn, hurricanes often occur, and this shed, which has no foundation and has barely been supported for nine years, may not be able to withstand it and be carried away by the wind. Therefore, for safety reasons, the main house must be rebuilt. If I don't have the strength, he is willing to lend me a hand. In addition, several friends in Suzhou, such as Zou Jinglao and Zhou Youhong, and brothers Mo Jing, Mao Pu, and Cheng Xiaoqing, also advised me to do it immediately, that it shouldn't be delayed, and that I might as well build it simply. Therefore, through Brother Pu's introduction, a upright and honest Architect Zhu was hired to undertake the work. Because of insufficient funds, it will still be a bungalow, and it will be completed in about two months. In order to use the old materials, it is necessary to dismantle this wooden shed. Therefore, I had to remove your memorial tablet on the day of your sixtieth day after death service, after hiring a Taoist priest. This is another very regrettable thing for you. As usual, I can no longer offer food and vegetables at noon every day, I don't know if you will be hungry? But your portrait is still enshrined, and I still offer you flowers, fruits, cigarettes, tea, and snacks. Every day I still call your name several times and talk to you, just like usual. After the wooden shed is demolished, it will be moved to the study. I imagine that with your virtue during your lifetime, you will definitely be able to understand my difficulties after death, right? Zou Jinglao and others, because I am guarding my home alone after losing you, think it's inevitably too lonely. Therefore, after the twenty-first day service, they invited me to go to the Youth Association for tea and conversation to relieve my boredom every evening. Old and new friends, joking and laughing, really helped me eliminate a lot of the pain in my heart. Sometimes I also watch movies and plays, giving my body and mind two or three hours of solace. But without you by my side, I can't help but feel a desolate sense of loss!</p>
<p>Since you left, my mind seems to have gone with you, I don't know where it is lost. Except for going out in the afternoon, the rest of the time I am always dull and keep company with flowers and trees, and I don't even want to get close to ink and books. My inspiration is blocked, my wisdom disappears, and I can't even start to write one or two articles mourning you or ten or twenty poems lamenting your death, I only feel a thousand thoughts, like a tangled mess. If I don't write, I feel sorry, so I delayed it until the forty-ninth day after death service before deciding to write you a letter and communicate with you through the afterlife. Who knew that if I didn't start writing, it would be fine, but once I started writing, it would evoke all kinds of memories. Thinking of the past and feeling the present, it's all material for sadness and heartbreak. Often tears would fall with the pen, and I would throw away the pen and couldn't continue writing after only writing a few lines. So this letter took more than two months to finish, which is the slowest work I have ever written in my life, how ashamed I am to say it! When you receive this letter, if there are any unclear words, you can ask Rong'er nearby. If you can meet me in a dream, then that will be considered receiving your reply. Because everything can be discussed face to face, and I can tell you all the pain of missing you these past two months. Alas! Feng, oh Feng, I hope that in the near future, you will gracefully enter my dream, show me a new path in life, give me the greatest courage, and let me live well! Feng, I'm waiting for you, waiting for you desperately; come to my dream soon! With leftover thoughts, I wish you happiness and health! Your old partner of twenty-nine years, Juan, wiping away tears with his hand. June 30th.</p>
