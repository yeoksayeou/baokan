<h3 id="c1">國民大會今晨開幕　蔣主席將親臨致詞　吳稚暉任大會臨時主席 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>〔本報南京十四日電〕國民大會定十五日上午十時舉行開幕式，程序如下：（一）典禮開始。（二）全體肅立。（三）主席就位。（四）奏樂。（五）唱國歌。（六）向國旗及國父遺像行最敬禮。（七）主席恭讀國父遺囑。（八）代表宣誓。（九）主席致開幕詞。（十）國民政府主席致詞。（十一）奏樂。（十二）禮成。茲錄代表宣誓詞如次：「×××敬以至誠，代表中華民國之人民，接受創立中華民國之孫先生之遺教，依法行使職權，並遵守國民大會之紀律，謹誓。」代表宣誓後，並將於誓詞上簽名。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十四日電〕國大確定於十五日揭幕，上午十時舉行開幕式，由黨國元老吳稚暉任臨時主席，蔣主席並將親臨致訓。下午無活動。十六日將開預備會議。國大籌備處開幕前夕，數百工作人員均至午夜未散，洪蘭友已因而致病，報到處亦延至午夜深候各黨派人士前往報到。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十四日電〕蔣主席偕夫人十四日四時蒞臨國防部，出席中央黨部招待出席國大諸代表茶會。主席以國民黨總裁地位致詞，歷述五十餘年來，尤其北伐以後廿年來黨的革命歷史，勗勉各同志出席此次國大，必須達成國民黨還政於民之重大任務，爲國家制定根本大法，尤須團結一致，共同奮鬥，把握現實環境，以求三民主義之充分實現，五權憲法之逐步完成。主席致詞時，全塲肅穆靜聆，歷一小時半方畢，熱烈鼓掌而散。</p>
<p>〔中央社南京十四日電〕國民大會籌備委會，以國大開幕在即，該會任務即將結束，十四日上午九時在國大會堂召開委員會議到委員吳鼎昌，張厲生，雷震，陳立夫及秘書長洪蘭友等，由吳鼎昌代理主席，會中除將籌委會各部門工作提出報吿加以檢討外，並曾依據籌委會組織條例，國大開幕時籌委會任務即行結束之規定，討論如何將籌委會工作全部移交大會之方法，當經決定俟大會秘書處成立時，由大會秘書處及籌備委員會會商交接日期。</p>
<p>〔中央社南京十四日電〕國民大會開會前夕，各方紛紛馳電，表示擁護，並祝賀大會成功，十四日到京電文如雪片飛來，係福建，江蘇，湖北，靑島，香港，北平，上海等地人民團體及民意機構所發出者。</p>
<h3 id="c2">靑年黨决定出席　社會賢達已報到 <a href="#c2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>〔本報南京十四日電〕中國靑年黨決定參加國民大會，代表名額一百名，大會揭幕後即提名單，陸續報到。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十四日電〕今日報到者有張發奎·王雲五·五叔銘·吳經熊·張藹眞·吳貽芳，社會賢達繆嘉銘·胡霖·李燭塵·莫德惠諸氏。及邊疆代表索南扎希蘇呼得力等，共四十六人，總共一四二〇人。又國大雖於十五日揭幕，唯各黨派人士及因交通關係未及趕到者，仍可隨時報到。</p>
<p>〔中央社南京十四日電〕國府十四日令，茲將國民大會代表之因故註銷名籍，改以候補人。各補者開列名單公布之，此令。國民政府直接道選代表王崑崙（因病在假不能出席）註銷名籍，吳經熊（遞補），軍隊代表潘文華（因防務關係不能出席）註銷名籍，王叔銘（遞補）。</p>
<p>〔又電〕參加國民大會旁聽之新聞記者，截至十四日止，登記數目大致確定，計中外報社通訊社二百廿二單位，其中外國記者四十三人，本國記者二百六十四人，總數爲三百零七人，打破國內集會新聞記者參加數目之紀錄。</p>
<h3 id="c3">其參加商談人士稱　政府最近將改組　籲求和平已作最大容忍 <a href="#c3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕記者昨訪最近由京來滬之參加商談人士，詢其對時局觀念，永吿政府當局對於目前尚未解決之局勢，已盡其最大忍耐。十二日國大開幕召集令頒佈後，各項手續均已齊備，邀請各國使節參加請柬亦已發出，但因欲待各黨各派提交名單出席大會，故再延期三日，其容忍之心可見。</p>
<p>政府當局，各黨各派及全國人士所希望達到之目的原係一致，無非欲求得和平，統一·民主，但如何達到和平·統一·民主，必須經過一途徑，此途徑除一致參加國大外無其他方法。談判而不　國大爲媒介，更夫從進行。政府　已表示其極大誠意，共黨若堅持不參加南　　大局，則跡近專橫，將爲大衆所不容，第三方面參加國大頗有可能，據可靠方面息，各黨派除民盟小部分接近中共之派系外，其餘日內均可提出名單，社會賢達中除郭沫若因耳病不擬參加外，餘均考慮報到，果爾則中共一黨不參加，對國大並無影響。</p>
<p>又據渠觀察政府必將改組，則其改組期限當不出一星期。國在此次開幕後將延遲一二日後開議，其休會期間，對於政府改組當有極大關係，而行政院改組亦在必然，國防最高委員會於政府改組後或將撤銷。</p>

<p>〔中央社本市訊〕台灣行政長官公署秘書長葛敬恩氏，已於十四日下午二時由台飛滬，當日即搭乘夜快車赴京報到，出席國大會議。據悉：葛氏於下週間仍須來滬一行，略事耽延再行晋京繼續出席會議。</p>
<p>〔又訊〕前日抵滬之國大代表靑島馬壽昌·　成功·任發琇·韓樹淼·蘇呼得力·索南扎希·李增蔭·李復參·李文明·西康代表馮宏等，業於昨晨七時，乘車晋京報到。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕市教局局長顧毓琇，於日前由歐美返國，據稱：渠此次提前歸來，係爲出席國大，故於十二日前趕赴南京報到，後因國大延期，乃復返上海，十四日上午，顧氏曾赴教育局辦公，而於當晚再度晋京出席。</p>

<p>京中央日報主張修正案提交國</p>
<p>〔本報南京十四日電〕孫院長十四日會接見一部分立委，就審識「五五憲草修正案草案」立法程度問題交換意見，並定十五日午後開全院談話會，共商此事。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十四日電〕中央日報今日社論以「五五憲草修正案」爲題，明白指出應以政治協商會議及綜合小組憲草審議會所商訂之五五憲草修正案（編者按：全文見今日本報特刋第二第三兩版）提交國民大會。該報稱：「我們對於修正案並不滿意，但是這一草案匯合了各方的意見，對於現實問題和立國根本都曾顧及，所以贊成蔣主席的決斷，將這部草案提交國民大會」。自十三日立法院五委員會聯席審查會抨舉該憲草違反國父遺教，違背二中全會決議等消息傳出之後，多數國民黨員均寄以同情，外間遂有種種揣測，以爲政府或將不以此修正案提交國民大會，而代之以廿五公布之五五憲草，關心大局者均以第三方面各黨派人士將因此而拒絕出席國大爲慮，今以國民黨機關報之中央日報表明此一態度，莫不感覺欣慰。</p>
<h3 id="c8">共黨應付時局　方法仍舊是拖 <a href="#c8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>〔本報南京十四日電〕首都中外觀察家，對共產黨應付時局之方法，已看得透澈，第一步，以先停戰後開國大爲詞，迨政府停戰，則又營其爲片面一變，而以停開國大爲先決條件，甚至非正式綜合會談商討憲草內容時，共產黨代表竟說國大停開問題不先決定，則憲草內容不必談，其不欲解決問題已顯然可見。但共產黨雖謂國大一旦召開，彼輩將撤回延安，實則未必如先，蓋共產黨今日抵憲　，而尚不想眞正破裂決戰也。</p>
<h3 id="c9">第三方面曾作最後努力　和談已吿一段落　中共代表團正準備撤退 <a href="#c9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>〔本報南京十四日電〕和談至十四日晚已吿一段落，各黨派態度亦已明朗，唯社會賢達代表竟日仍作最後努力，胡霖且於十四日晨八時半自滬飛京，同時飛京者尚有張君勱·李璜·蔣勻田，彼等旋於十一時在交行開會，並於十二時發表公吿，表示在剩餘之半日內，仍將作最後努力，以求挽救危局，旋張君勱·張申府·章伯鈞·沈鈞儒·羅隆基·黃炎培六人至梅園新付應周恩來邀宴，據張申府對記者稱，係往與周恩來作惜別談話。下午三時羅隆基·黃炎培·沈鈞儒·張申府四氏，再應吳鐵城之約，同赴孫科寓，與繆嘉銘·莫德惠·陳啓天·雷震諸氏會晤，並有所洽談，迄五時始散。張君勱·李璜·蔣勻田十四日下午十一時夜車赴滬。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十四日電〕民主社會黨張君勱於十四日晨偕蔣勻田，李璜，胡霖等抵京後，旋即赴交行先與黃炎培作密談，嗣參加「第三方面」之談話會。該黨態度，據可靠方面報吿謂，代表名單事實上已開就，原擬就民盟一百廿名中，劃出四十名，但亦微嫌不足，且經共黨及民盟其他分子加以壓力，該黨雖云不受拘束，而形勢似又稍變。張君勱表示，希望兩點：（一）國大再延期至十二月一日開幕，（二）此延期時間盡力求得政協決議之全盤實現，謂如此方可推出代表參加國大，是則民主社會黨之表示不啻爲有條件的參加，而民盟其他份子大率將窺伺共黨之顏色，以爲轉移，共黨旣堅主「國大必須停開」，非延期所能滿意，則彼輩雖欲參加亦不便逕有所表示，周恩來殆已責若干人爲賣友矣。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十四日電〕民盟與社會賢達代表，十四日晚八時復在交通銀行集會，原定出席之靑年黨代表未與會，至九時，民盟代表張申府稱，今晚一切大勢已定，現已無話可說，欲說之話與中午所發公吿相同，旋社會賢達代表莫德惠，錢新之，繆嘉銘，胡霖，李燭塵五人，對於國大報到事，對記者發表談話稱，我們在十一日晚，感於大局破壞即在眉睫，共謁主席請求延期，作最後努力，爭取和平，當時曾有諾言，今三日之期已滿，我們准於本晚報到，又錢新之單獨談稱，我是上海區的代表，我有我的選民，不能不參加。黃炎培稱，因學校學生必須上課，故午晚必赴滬，有機會當仍爲和平盡力。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十四日電〕張君勱今晚未作其他表示，民盟除午間所發公吿，認爲必須遵照政協決議外，亦無表示，共黨則堅決不參加。今晚中共代表團發言人稱，國大召開自爲破裂之表示，代表團之撤退，尚未作最後決定，惟已在準備中。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕靑年黨左舜生氏十四日晨八時許由京來滬，即晚十時即搭夜車返京，數日後尚將來滬。</p>
<h3 id="c10">黃炎培來滬　準備閉門讀書 <a href="#c10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>〔本報南京十四日電〕黃炎培前日代民盟宣讚聲明「暫不參加」，昨又向人表示，此時共產黨態度堅決，較前大異，協議暫無希望，祗好退而不問。故自身不願遠爾參加，留爲將來奔走轉圜之地，準備十四日夜車回滬，杜門謝客，寫字讀書，惟彼亦不欲阻止他人參加國大。蓋共產黨今旣欲分道揚　，則政府不顧一切召開國大，亦祇有聽其好好幹去耳。惟今日之事，重在政府之設施，故國大制憲尚爲其次，而如何改組政府，尤爲吾人所注意云云。</p>
<h3 id="c11">和平仍有希望 <a href="#c11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>梁漱溟在平談時局</p>
<p>〔本報北平十四日電〕梁漱溟十四日對記者稱：和平似仍有望。他說：目前時局確已臨危險的關頭，現在各方正在破裂的空氣裏摩索破裂的邊緣，說似仍有挽回之道，因爲美方必不願意雙方破裂。第三方面亦正繼續其和平努力，而政府似亦不願走上破裂途徑。在此種情勢下，國大延期頗有可能。如果國大不延期，他判斷民盟任何一派，都不會提出國大代表名單，靑年黨也沒有提出名單的跡象。他自稱來平後，足不出戶，但也不拒絕別人去看他，李宗仁，葉劍英，張東蓀都曾作過他的座上客。十四日他曾到燕大講「淺近與深遠」，預定廿一日飛渝主持他的勉仁學院。</p>
<h3 id="c12">張嘉璈曾來滬　昨已飛返首都 <a href="#c12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>
<p>〔中央社本市訊〕東北行轅經委會主任張嘉璈，十三日下午二時半由京抵滬，昨晨六時半復飛返首都，據悉，張氏此次來滬，爲料理私人事務，在滬勾留僅十五小時。</p>

<p>〔本報北平十四日電〕政府重視華北國軍收復區救濟問題，將派谷正倫部長北來督導，聞谷氏本月廿日左右可望北來，除冀省外，谷氏將赴察綏，甚至晋熱等省視察。河北急賑費前中央核定五億元，經張繼·鹿鍾麟向宋院長力爭結果，已經行政院增加爲十五億元，此外，並由綏靖區政務委員會撥發麵粉四千噸，繼頭五百噸，第一批麵粉二千噸，本月廿日可到津，第二批二千噸，下月五日前亦可到。冀省府爲散放賑款，賑麵，將成立救濟大隊，大隊部設北平，下轄若干中隊，初步計劃擬於唐山·滄縣·保定各配一中隊，冀南東明亦擬設一中隊。據赴瀋人員稱：此次政府撥發賑糧賑款，不謂不鉅，如此項麵粉折價，亦祗六十餘億，以現有河北難民三是萬平均分配，亦不過每人二斤多，仍屬杯水車薪。</p>

<p>——並祝國民大會開幕</p>
<p>自國大延期改至今日開慕，立法院五委員會聯席會議，對五五憲草修正案草案訂正稿未予審議以來，關於憲草的問題，當爲世人所關心，國大的召開，其目的原在制憲，而憲法的制訂，原須有憲法草案爲依據。專爲制憲的國民大會旣定於今日揭慕於南京，而由主席交付立法院審議修正，依據「政協」修正原則所訂正的五五憲草修正案草案訂正稿，該院猶未接納審議，是則目前政局的重心，無寗說是在憲法的制訂，以爲國家立長治久安的穩固基礎。</p>
<p>立法院此次之所以未接納五五憲草修正案草案訂正稿的審議，據報傳消息，係由於交付審議的程序不合規定，蓋此案並不出於中常會的决議，或國防最高委員會的决議，僅由主席以代電交發該院，而此案關係重要，似有未合，立法院對憲草案修正案草案訂正稿的審議，如果僅是一個程序問題，那倒也簡單；這裏還包含着內容問題，就是修正案草案訂正稿裏面的條文，是否有背於我立國之三民主義。這是一個重要的問題，就立法院說，它本身旣已有五五憲草的制訂，且經國府公布，除非有中常會或國防最高委員會的指示，自未便遽予更革，這種立塲是可以爲國人諒解的。法律不外人情，當前的客觀事實，我們也未便一筆予以抹殺。關於程序方面，原係因時間的關係，而不得不有此權宜變通之計；如今旣被提出，補辦手續，未始不能及時使其合於立法程序的規定。然而問題却還是蘊藏着；所謂程序問題僅是此蘊藏着的問題之另一形相而已。</p>
<p>這蘊藏着的問題是什麼？第一，五五憲草爲國府依據立法院所通過的憲草而頒布的，「政協」爲國家法律系統外的組織，其所爲的決議，無拘束國府的效力；不能因「政協」的決議而將國府所已頒布的憲草遽予取消。這在理論上自無可非議，但與常前客觀事實的距離，相差太遠，母寗接受現實，似爲得計。不錯，「政協」是國家法律系統外的一種組織，「政協」的決議，自沒有它們法律上的地位及效力；但這種非正式的無法律效力的決議，倘經過正當的手續，而爲政府所接受，未始不能認爲政府本身的一種意志，因而發生效力。在今天這個時候，我們似乎不必拘泥法理，况且有許多事在理論上也未始不是完全講不通的。</p>
<p>但問題的核心却還是：依據「政協」决議所通過的憲草修正原則面修正的修正憲草草案是否果眞合乎三民主義的精神？在這裏我們必須消除兩種成見：（一）五五憲草，雖本三民主義之精神而制訂，未必一定是三民主義精神最好的表現，絕對不許修正；（二）「政協」的決議，雖由各黨各派以及無黨無派人士爲之，未必一定有背乎三民主義的精神。三民主義憲法的草訂，沒有成規可循，一切事實首創。五五憲草的制擬，前曾化了極大的努力，固然充分反映了三民主義的精神；但其所定的制度，鑒於近十年來，尤其是最近幾年來的演變，是吾爲最合理想，要亦不無疑問。所以我們絕對不能固執成見，以爲只有五五憲草纔是三民主義精神最理想的表現。至於「政協」的決議，雖其間對於三民主義有不甚扣緊之處，但未必全部有背於三民主義的精神。報載此次政府所擬提交國大而尙未經立法院審議的修正憲草，於遵守「政協」決議之中，仍舊一本三民主義的嚴正立塲。是其修正，未必一定有背乎三民主義之精神，本甚明顯；矧我主席及立法院院長孫科，於此次修正案之擬訂，又曾親加指示，是其不背於三民主義之基本立塲，允可想見。所以對於此次憲草的修正，應該可爲國大制憲的依據。</p>
<p>如今國大舉行開慕，爲我國立長治久安之基的國家根本大法，即將由該會制定，付諸實施。我們於此所不能不申述的，即國大代表雖來自各方，然應有一個共同建設三民主義新中國的理想。此次憲法的制訂，實應充分表現三民主義的精神。所以我們不能拘泥於成見，但憲法旣經是國家根本的大法，自亦不能草率從事，必須審議周密，始克有濟。如何能使我們的國家有一部完善的憲法，是則有望於此次國民大會的召開。茲値國大開幕之辰，謹向國民大會致我們祝賀之忱。願由於此次國大的召開，能够奠定我們國家長治久安的基礎！</p>

<h3 id="c57">理髮攤擔的呼籲 <a href="#c57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>我們是里弄巷頭理髮攤擔的一羣，全市依此爲生的，除家屬不計外，有四千餘人，我們的營業地雖然都散居在街頭巷尾，均經過合法的租賃，而對於交通與衛生問題，是完全顧及，可說並無「有碍衛生妨害交通」情事。</p>
<p>我們的顧客，是薪水階級和勞苦大衆，因爲我們所取的代價，祗有普通店家的二分之一、所以深得大衆的稱頌。</p>
<p>在上月的十日，本市理髮業同業公會召開各區代表大會，他們報吿了一件議案，「市街攤擔林立，店中營業淸淡，業由公會呈請警政當局，要求取締，刻已奉到市長批覆，准予取締，並由衛生局再行函請警局聯合衛生分所，隨時査禁」等語。</p>
<p>可憐我們弱小的一羣，過的是最低微的生活，看到了這樣一條驚人消息，莫不個個目定口呆，好像睛天一個霹靂，倘如一旦實行取締，我們沒有其他技能，槍偷不可能，除掉「待斃」以外，還有什麽辦法，但是一天天的過去，並沒有遭遇到取締。</p>
<p>同業公會方面，見到我們還在照常營業，一心一意的要置我們數千人的生命於死地，竟又補呈申請加重了我們的罪名，說我們「妨碍交通有害衛生」，所謂「欲加之罪，何患無辭」。要是我們攤擔果有違犯他們所提的二項條款，也不須同業公會具文申請，警政當局早已着手取締了，在這一點方面着想，完全是營業上發生妒嫉，這是最明顯的事實。</p>
<p>最近我們的厄運來臨了，警局方面果眞准了他們所請實行取締，並且限期停業，我們不是資本家，更沒有後盾，是可憐的攤擔們，那敢違抗命令，在毫無辦法情形下，祗有向當局請願，並且請各界人士同情給我們一條生路。（周學銓）</p>
<h3 id="c58">上海爲什麼不禁舞 <a href="#c58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>「舞廰」多好聽多漂亮的名字，然而牠的存在，對國家對社會，無論是間接的，或是直接的，究竟有什麽益處，我可以作一個堅決的定語：「有百害而無一利」。我知道有許多人，一定以爲我的話說得太過份了，可是事實如此，請看：</p>
<p>牠（舞廳）的外貌，是多麽的富麗堂皇，一陣陣興奮熱烈的音樂，和着悠揚動聽的歌聲，吹播在每夜的街頭，然而她的內心呢？罪惡·無恥·卑鄙。淫靡。多少有志的靑年在此墮落，多少靑廉的員左因了牠而貪汚，多少安份的人們因爲到這裏去而盜竊·敲詐·欺騙！最使我們觸目痛心的，是一班最高學府的智識靑年，竟也拋棄了寳貴的書木，躱在這裏鬼混！</p>
<p>這罪惡的舞廳，——都市的銷金窟，牠直接迷惑了多少淸楚的人們，吮吸了多少不義的金錢，間接影響了整個社會的安寗，國家的强盛，旣然如此，她爲什麽要存在呢？難道是大都市必要的點綴嗎？抑是美國盛行這一種娛樂我們這可憐的國家也應當勉力以仿嗎？</p>
<p>假定說：把全市舞塲的資本集中起來，開設一家較巨的工廠，試想能救濟多少失業工人，能生產多少實用物品？這樣才是踏上建立新中國的大道。</p>
<p>設若舞廳禁閉以後，最嚴重的是如何解決舞女的生活問題，許多許多人都說：舞女可憐，姊們的供人樓抱，完全出於生活逼迫的不得已。然而，我却要嚴正的說一句：「她們並不可憐」。她們的所以幹此行業，並不完全是生活的驅使，一半還是她們自己思想錯誤，虛榮心過重，她們同樣有一雙萬能的手，在當初儘可能找一件別的工作，爲什麼要踏進罪惡的圈子裘去呢？常然她們想舒適一點，想多賺點錢，所以就毫不疑遲的跳進深潭裏去，試想値此國內兵燹。災害。哀鴻遍野的時候，還須要可憐這些，因了貪慕虛榮享受而失足的人嗎？</p>
<p>總而言之，跳舞是一種不正當的娛樂，况且國運崎嶇，建國困難，我們豈能再沉湎在燈紅酒綠的聲色堪中，我們應當禁閉牠，消滅牠，所疑　的，京杭等地均已禁舞，爲什麼惟獨上海不能實行呢？</p>
<p>最後，我希望市府當局能接受我的建議。（王煌）</p>

<p>〔本報特寫〕麻瘋，，提起這名字，就不禁幻想到一個可怕的影子：面孔浮腫，兩耳脹大，沒有眉毛，另外有一種神經性的麻瘋患者，兩、麻瘋是一切疾病中最可怖的，它使患者毁容，受到社會的唾棄和鄙視。肉體上的痛苦固已綿綿無期，精神上的迫害更是無窮無盡。</p>
<p>基督敎是全世界對麻瘋病人表同情的唯一宗敎，新的巾耶穌醫愈大麻瘋患者，已是大家熟知的故事了。「巾華麻瘋救濟會」就是以基督敎的人道立塲，從事剷除麻瘋的工作。</p>
<p>全中國各地的麻瘋患者幾達一百萬人，尤其以南部和西南部各省最多。也許這是因爲氣候炎熱，及人民生活不合衛生的緣故。　據可靠的估計，散佈在上海。四百萬人口中，麻瘋患者約在三千人左右。他們之中有乞丐，有小販，有百貨公司職員，有大師傳，有洋琴鬼，有皮鞋店老闆。所以，我們隨時都有和麻瘋患者發生接觸的可能。這是多麼的危險。</p>
<p>歐美國家有的有麻瘋法令，警察發現麻瘋患者，有權逮捕，送入麻瘋院强迫治療。因爲這批人也是危害社會治安者。在中國則不然了，麻瘋患者有充份的自由，不受任何千涉。</p>
<p>麻瘋現已是一種可以治癒的疾病，但首先，必須與社會隔離。這是爲了公衆的安全。所以中華麻瘋救濟會的工作，有兩大目標，一是救濟麻瘋患者，二是保衛社會安全。</p>
<p>「中華麻瘋救濟會」成立於民國十五年，在海南島，湖南，廣東，江西各地都設立了麻瘋療餐院，對病人施以科學的治療。華南各地，由於人民的偏見，有許多麻瘋院如同牢獄，把患者視同猪狗不如，甚至有槍斃麻瘋患者的事情。</p>

<h3 id="c108">太平洋戰事以前　零儲整付存款　八百倍償還一案　聚興誠不服上訴 <a href="#c108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>高院勸諭雙方試行和解　表示不願造成判例</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕關於戰前債務償還一問題，近引起社會人士極大關注，並一再發生爭訟。昨日高院第五民庭，又審理聚興誠銀行五年期零存整付儲蓄存款地院判以八百倍計算給付之上訴一案。羅有原吿陸焜昆仲，於民國廿七年九月二十八日，與同年十二月十四日起，各向聚興誠銀行存有特種零儲整付存款，定期五年，均至民國三十一年五月份止，陸煜計結存入二千三百十一元四角三分，陸焜計結存入二千一百八十五元零三分，陸氏兄弟曾於本年六月廿八日委託律師函詢聚興誠銀行，未獲結果，乃於八月間具狀地院請求以一千倍償還，經地院於九月中旬審結判決，認爲幣値低落，生活指數高漲，確爲題著之事實，若對於以前之存款由債務人依照原數淸償，自屬有失公平，而債權人要求增加給付亦屬事理之常，且爲合法之舉。唯全部存款係絡續零存，其中十份之四在三十年與三十一年存入，故法院斟酌兩造情形，酌定以八百倍計算，給付陸煜法幣一百八十四萬九千一百四十四元，陸焜怯幣一百七十四萬入千零二十四元，均自起訴日起至執行終了日止，按月九厘之利息，原吿等其餘之訴駁回，訴訟費用被吿負担。</p>
<p>九月十九日被吿聚興誠銀行接到地院判決書後，以零存整付儲蓄存款與其他定期存款情形不同，銀行辦理儲蓄業務，依照儲蓄銀行法，其資本運用受嚴格之限制，除應將總額四分之一以政府公債交存中央銀行特設之保管庫爲償還儲蓄存款之担保外，其他運用方法採利薄本固政策，範圍至爲隘狹，抗戰時期本市遭敵僞刦持，銀行方面投資運用範圍越形隘狹，非一般從事暴利可比，不能負担八百倍之數目，故即向高院上訴。昨日下午三時開庭，上訴人聚興誠銀行代理律師姚肇第，被上訴人代理律師王伯憲均出席，推事程瑞錕對案情訊問一過後，即勸諭兩造試行和解，並表示法院不願造成判例，如和解不成，則法院當收集有關資料斟酌情形加以處斷，並盼兩造多收集統計材料，以助法院判決，本案改期再訊。</p>
<h3 id="c109">另一起儲蓄存款　千倍給付　亦未定案 <a href="#c109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>又市民陳季琳於民國二十九年五月六日，以法幣二千元存於四行儲蓄會，作五年長期儲蓄存款，於上年五月六日到期，陳向法院提起訴訟，認爲依據復員後辦理民事訴訟補充條例第十二條，及司法院院字第三〇一八號解釋，請求以三千信增加給付一案，經地院判決被吿四行儲蓄會，應以一千倍增加付給，唯四行儲蓄會因財政部對戰前公債，已照原値給付，中央儲蓄會淸理舊有儲蓄存款，亦按舊値計算，故向高院提起上訴，昨日開庭仍未審結，諭改期再訊。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕袁履登漢奸罪嫌案，前由本市高院於五月卅一日將袁判處無期徒刑，被吿奉判不服，上訴最高法院聲請覆判，經最高法院判決，認爲有利於被吿之證明，原審未盡調查之責，遽予量刑，實非確當，故予發還更審。該案高院本定昨日上午開庭，因故又展至下午二時半提審，至四時十五分詢畢，因尙需調查證據，故改期再訊，被吿還押。</p>
<p>該案昨由邱煥瀛推事偕唐銓書記官升庭主審，所詢注重於被吿所任偽上海市保甲自治籌備委員會主任委員及僞米統會主任委員兩點，袁衣藍調長袍，黑襪，黑鞋，鼻架黑玳瑁邊眼鏡，供稱：卅一年二月十四日本市有六區地方發生炸彈案，各區皆被封鎖，時被吿任工部局華董，並以商界地位設法奔走，日方以出任保甲主任委員爲解除封鎖條件，當時想救人總不會錯，乃挺身而出。辦理未及三月即交卸，由警局接辦。至出任僞米統會主任委員，亦爲維持上海民食，發配戶口米。至卅三年五乃，戶口米配給中斷，即於五月廿八日稱病入虹橋療養院堅辭。至辭職照准，方始出院云。庭上繼詢被吿在僞新巾國日報等所發表之媚敵言論，袁均加以否認。並稱：我究竟人格還有，講過的決不賴。又稱：曾被日人擄往虹口，當時將我弄死了，倒亦成了名。我政治思想一點沒有，法律亦不懂，我是基督敎徒，一切動機全在救人，但求良好上爽快。我在上海的一切所爲以至私生活，問何德奎都知道。</p>
<p>郁秉堅等·出庭作證</p>
<p>庭上繼根據被吿所提證人，」一傳詢，有前賑濟委員會江浙兩省特派員黃涵元，現任交通部上海電訊局長郁秉堅，前中央賑濟委員會委員毛各源，火柴商邵修善，畫家鄭午昌，敎員吳靜波等皆稱曾被敵憲逮捕由被吿設法救出。被吿之辯護律師江一平，則呈上袁在民國卅三年五月爲辭僞米統會主任委員入虹橋療養院養病之記錄簿，（因如在卅三年六月以前脫離僞職者，政府曾有令得予減刑）並呈上偽米統會二千餘封公函之摘要，及本市三千多商號聯名爲被吿之證明書，請庭上體察當時上海之環境及被吿參加僞保甲會及僞米統會之動機。審判長可自此數千商號中，隨意抽查一二，皆可爲被吿作證明云。江律師並請庭上傳詢在押之聞蘭亭，林康侯，唐壽民，陳國權，周純裕五人調査關於偽米統會情形。</p>
<p>審訊期限·請求展長</p>
<p>並稱：唐壽民先判無期徒刑，繼之袁履登亦判無期徒刑。再而李澤判三年，林康侯判六年，聞蘭亭判八年。此五案互相牽連，有因果關係。承辦推事因前一個這樣判了，後一個似不得不這樣辦。因之所受牽制很多。此次袁案發還　審，爲求法治精神的聞澈與主持公道，請求鈞院將審訊期限展長，待其他各案發還　審，於同期內判決，以免受到牽制。另一方面籌護人亦可有充份時間搜集證據云。庭上僅答自當予以時間搜集有利證憑。即再詢被吿有何話說，袁答；被吿生平寗可損已利入，自己吃虧以救他人，請審判長體諒此點云。至此，庭諭改期再訊，即吿退庭。被吿與家屬略談數語後，仍還押忠　。</p>

<p>（一）委曲求全</p>
<p>唐水明問　某甲現年一十四歲，十九歲時由家長作主與乙訂婚，甲本人雖非同意，亦不反對，詎乙於訂婚前一月，意圖服毒自殺，申則懸端乙方不滿此項婚的，旋由乙方家長及乙本人之邀請，直接與乙晤談，說明自殺之經過及動機。始知乙另有男友，已互許終身，此次行將與甲訂婚，遂感左右爲難，出此下策。甲方委曲求全，允與乙方訂婚，嗣後即賦同居，然兩人性情，，始終不合，時生齬齬，茲有問題數則請予以答覆：（一）倘甲向乙提出離婚僅以感情不睦，及精神損失爲理由，能否成立？（二）甲爲離婚之主動者，但並未結婚，有吾支付乙方生活贍養費之必要？（三）甲提出離婚要求後，倘乙有自殺行爲發生，則甲有無法律資任？</p>
<p>〔朱亞揆律師答〕（一）離婚應以民法第一〇五二條所列各款爲依據，不能以空洞之感情不睦或精神損失爲理由，査甲乙並未結婚，祗能稱爲同居關係；（二）依照民法第一〇五七條，夫妻之一方，因離婚而陷於生活困難時他方縱無過失亦應給與相當之贍養費；（三）如無威脅自殺之事實及行爲，當不能負責。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕昨日油市賡續上漲，記者特趨訪吳市長，叩詢今後對本市食油之施策問題。承吿：本市食油自下週起，每月將經常有三萬六千担，撥供各食油零售店按議　平售。該項食油，由中國食油公司及中國植物油廠，各分担一萬担。其餘一萬六千祖，歸九家民營榨油廠負担。（惟在民營廠生產未復正常前，先負担一萬二千祖。其餘四千担，仍積極設法增產。）本週內食油價格之波動，純係外帮駐滬申莊，自外帮來油之價格所造成，與本市議價並無關係。按外帮來油，以成本較高，故喊價較本市自榨食油之成本議價爲高。然此係外埠食油成本之事，當不在管轄之列。再一方面，本週內各民營廠以恢復正常榨油伊始，配油尙未充份，各零售店或有供不應求之事發生。惟自下週一起，國民營各油廠恢復正常配售，則各食油零售店，必能按議價經常平售，望市民安心。又零售商如有將配油轉售圖利者，一經發覺，決予嚴微不貸。</p>
<p>又據食油另售業方面消息：該業昨日辦理食油另售商登記，已有四百餘家前來登記。本市醬酒及醬園兩業，昨亦聲請加入配售食油。聞零售商公會原則上已准所請，惟須先辦理入會手續。</p>
<p>昨日靑島生油，昻達十四萬元。惟大多係靑島駐滬各由莊之喊價，貨均在各客商手中，零售商稱無法控制。惟如此高價，成交極稀。聞社會局仍囑令各客商速予出售。且査靑島生油來本，目前不過爲十二萬元。故該項高價，決不能特久云。</p>
<p>油貸大體決定　廠商希望增加</p>
<p>食油市塲，仍未底定，吳市長爲澈底平抑油價，曾宣布由市銀行貸款五億元，作爲各民營油廠購買原料資金頃愁：市銀已行擬定辦法，各廠所需資金，由油業公會決定數額，以各廠生產力之大小，分配貸款之多寡，時間定爲三個月至六個月，利息五分，並組審核委員會，對各廠貸款，作最後決定。審核委員會由市府，油業公會，及市銀行會同組織，並邀市參議會派代表參加，聞該會下週內可成立，貸款即開始辦理，目前食油原料價格上漲，芝麻每担四萬五千元，黃豆每担二萬八千元，如購芝麻，僅一萬餘担，可產油四千担，購黃豆亦祗二萬担，可產油二千担，故五萬萬之數，不敷應用，各民營廠商，希吳市長增撥貨款數額，據聞如按事實需要，二十億始够週轉。</p>

<p>公債仍由西商委托三三三室代購雜牌及統丙，是以在多了結之賣風，稍有扶持，跌勢緩和，統丙晨開一三五〇元，曾低至一二六〇元，始起買風，回升至一四二〇元，最後在一四〇〇之左右盤旋，結果較收下挫四十元，甲乙丁各挫卅元，統戊軋跌一〇〇元。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕昨日紗市仍在停滯狀態中，廿支紗有求無供，價殊紊亂，大致又高三兩萬，四十二支漲上十萬，十六支呆滯如故，三十二支細紗，客帮有意搜羅，而根子極乏，僅靑島貨銀月牌有北帮運來，略有現貨供售，價約較上月昇五七萬，至實用廠商，以已有配給，交易日少一日，紗廠除供應紡管會配給貨以外亦不向市塲拋售，因此市塲極淸淡，昨日布市晨平平，上午紡建僅開出龍頭一種，各路客帮前日觀望，昨又有搜購下午各貨均向上升，龍頭現貨喊八萬四千元，三A彩球八萬二千元，色布亦因坯布及顏料價漲關係。上漲三千元之譜。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕目前本市染料之供給，大部來自敵產處理局配售之德孚顏料；英美貨入口甚少，商人有專至香港辦貨者，亦甚少結果。商界人士之解釋：爲染料工業在戰時均改爲軍需工業，列强一因國際形勢緊張，染料工業均未復員，故來貨奇缺，有人且推測五年之內，供給不至充分。本市染料商共約一八〇家，目前營業不甚景氣，原因爲染料與絲綢棉布三業相互依賴，必需後兩業發達繁榮，其銷路方可擴充，今綢布業均不景氣，其需要量自隨之低落矣。</p>

<h3 id="c158">平漢北段前綫 <a href="#c158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>— 本報駐平記者宋紹柏</p>
<p>四日北平航訊</p>
<p>本漢綫北段戰事正激烈的時候，記者於十月卅日奉命到平保段的前方去視察，沿途停留的地方有　　松林店，定　，北河店，固城，徐水等地。　　是共軍　國軍集中力量於察省的空隙哦，自九月廿十九日起在平漢北段發動攻勢一路北上攻城陷地的發展頂點，察省戰事吿一段落後，國軍一部主力轉移此綫，逐漸收復松林店等失陷地點到十一月二日收復徐水，平保段共軍的控制力已吿瓦解，記者於三日晚歸來北平。指揮此段國軍作戰的九十四軍軍長牟廷芳同日由前方返平向當局報吿此一段作戰經過，同時商討次一步保石段打通問題。</p>
<p>記者會見了在前方作戰的牟廷芳軍長及其幕僚，師長，以及暫歸牟廷芳指揮向正面前進的五十三軍一百三十師師長王理寰，這是一位始終站在最前鋒的軍人，設前進指揮所於涿縣的牟軍長，幾無日不到前綫督師，二日上午十時半收復徐水，牟軍長於十一時半同記者等進入該城。牟軍長與隨軍攻入城內的王師長握手的時候，表現了軍人勝利後的愉快感。</p>
<p>另一方面，記者化了更多的時間訪問了設公署於涿縣的河北省第六行政區專員崔世昌（他是傅作義民十六困守涿縣三個月時候的參謀主任，劉峙任第六戰區畏官時的副參謀長）以及各縣縣長，砲火下的老百姓，五日間的戰地行程，記者得到這樣幾種印象：『對共作戰也容易，也困難。』『兩方面都好就是我們老百姓不好。』「毁於一旦的數年工程，將不是我們自身現有力量所能重建的。』「老百姓雜在」奸匪「與」八大爺」之間。』「地方行政軍事第一。』『打仗的將領心底蘊藏着和平。』</p>
<p>對共軍作戰　也容易也困難</p>
<p>軍事能否解決問題？在前綫上仍舊不能得到肯定的答覆。也許可以這樣說：親自和共軍打仗的人，對於這個問題，大多是審愼的，團長以下的軍官沒有把共軍看得本輕。國軍要取得的目標，幾乎無往而不克，但是對於佔領後的每一據點的精力的化費，並不比攻擊的時候少，國軍每次攻擊一個目標，無論經過激戰與吾，最終仍舊是共軍退卞去，假使空軍配合得好，在北方的大平原上，共軍更要受到慘重的損失。徐水縣城與車站的戰鬥，有五千共軍暴露在空軍的機槍下，是役共軍遭遇了甚大的損失，但是他們的武器並沒有失掉，撤離的距點也僅只相隔十幾里，他們準備　隨時捲土重來。一個共軍配備有三個老百姓爲其服務，這些老百姓往往就死在他身上佩帶的二顆手溜彈上。據一個士兵說，共軍打衝鋒的是老百姓（共方稱之爲民兵），夜晚潛入國軍陣地投手　彈炸彈埋地雷的也是老百姓，這些稍經訓練便上前綫的「民兵」便成百成千的這樣死掉了！爲這事我曾問牟軍長是否便讓這些幾乎不知打仗爲何物的老百姓如此大量死掉呢？牟軍長說：「你不打死他，他會向你投手溜彈的！」「那些人不知道會被打死的嗎？」「他不死在國軍的槍下，便會死在後面的共軍手中，不上也得上的呀！」在成千成萬的修鐵路的老百姓中，記者眼見壯年人的確是少見了！</p>
<p>「口袋戰術」是共軍此次在漕河徐水間使用的一種，但是在裝　優良的國軍下，「口袋」被鐵　刺破了，主力不能不撤到西邊　地去，爲了總捉不到共軍的主力，九十四軍在最後兩天組成了摩托化的快速部隊，這給了共軍一個嚴重威脅，共軍的戰術，向來是畫伏夜出，但是平保段的共軍變成了白天退却。夜裏間或襲擊一次國軍據點，但沒有一次成功。不過要蕭淸共軍，還不是一件容易事。據指揮作戰的某參謀長說：國軍最大的苦惱是感覺地方武力與政治配合不上軍事，使人不能免除後顧之憂。政府的村級幹部遠不及共黨的村級幹部來得厲害，這是一個非常不簡單的問題。保警隊，自衛團武裝單簿，訓練允差，在共軍集中武力猛攻下，能不失掉據點便很難得了。爲了失城的損失太大，河北省主席孫連仲最近發下命令，凡是失城的縣長，不論理由如何，一槪免職。</p>
<p>數年建築　毀於一旦</p>
<p>在記者所經過的地方，那些老百姓每天唯一的工作是「扒路」和「修路」，將來或還有一種「看路」的任務到頭上來，據一位鐵路工人說，他知道有一條電綫桿被砍倒過五百多次，平漢北段此次被扒的鐵路達一百五十公里之長，鋼橋則有八十多孔被炸毁。共軍爲了扒路，特別組織了工兵營，速率之快，破壞之澈底，是可以稱之爲世界第一的，北河店的二十九孔鋼橋完全被炸毀了，橋基坍碎，橋樑爆破。據一位八十多歲的老者說，當年修此鋼橋正正化費了六年工夫，在共軍的高明技術破壞下，也要三個夜晚才破壞完，震天的爆破聲，震死了隣村未滿二個月的九個嬰孩。再要修恐怕就不是我們的技術所能成功的了。爲了使路基一時不能築起，共軍驅數十里內的老百姓來掘成了曲直錯線的深溝，枕木上架鋼軌，點火一燒，枕木燒成灰，鋼軌成廢鐵。據平漢路當局說，前存的器材殆已用盡，如此的大規模破壞，修復實在感覺困難，所以修路工程，日不及數里，方修復的路基，三十華里的路程行車要用二小時，車行路上，旅客下車小便後仍可以從客上車。記者所見的松林店，高碑店，定興，北河店，固城等車站所有房屋及鐵路設施完全被毁，北河店破壞之澈底，使人路經該地而不知其曾爲車站，現在鐵路人負，就在鐵門車上辦公。地方政府發動着「勞動服務」，每天有二萬老百姓修路，七八十歲的老頭兒，十三四歲的小孩，每人帶了二個玉米乾糧去作此無報償的直到修復爲止的工，一位修路的老者眼睛濕濕的說：「我們被驅着破壞的時候已經知道修路的還是我們！」藏有鐵路器材的人有的送回來，但多已是不能使用了，在誰家裘搜出一顆道釘來，是以通匪論罪的。鐵路以外，所有共軍佔過退走的地方的公共建築也完全被燬了，這樣的大規模的破壞，還沒有人能以數字計算出來，看見這些破壞殘跡，眞使人發生末日之感。牟軍長平常談起共軍無多表示，但在每次提起共軍的破壞行爲，他便會恨恨的說聲「該死」。</p>
<p>涿縣縣黨部的書記長蕭佩蓀告訴記者，他下鄉去視察曾問到老百姓究竟是共產黨好，還是政府好，那老百姓哭喪　臉回答說：「共產黨也好，政府也好，不好的是我們老百姓！」他聽見幾乎落下淚來。善良的老百姓，不懂得什麼主義，只曉得每一支軍隊來，都要他們拿出東西來，住屋甚至在軍隊未到前已被砲燬了。共產黨要徵「民兵」，雖然都知道甚至眼見一個個「民兵」被槍砲打死，但是仍不能不讓自己的兒子被徵而去。</p>
<p>老百姓訴苦　蕭書記長要落淚</p>
<p>國軍駐地的老百姓普遍的說，國軍紀律比較抗戰前强多了，這些地方的老百姓看見國軍還是第一次，雖然負担加重些，但他們希望國軍駐下去，拉鋸式的進出，老百姓是怕透了，所以他們密願多出些東西。以九十四軍說，已博得當地老百姓的愛護，軍隊所取諸當地的僅有柴草，徵購毫無困難。目前每一兵士合乾柴就斤，發價爲五十元，較市價便宜二分之一，這是因爲上面所發的公款僅能合得此數。此外地方對軍隊的負担，是爲陣亡的兵士買棺材，徵用大取，每日給酬八千元，稱得起是公買公賣了，而且在商人說勿寗是歡迎駐國軍的，這　他們的買賣會好些。所苦的是對地方團隊及行政人員的補助費，這就要了商民的命，舉一個例：一個保安隊中隊是一百零入一人，公款全部每月是一百萬，每人的合八九千元，每天吃一頓玉米窩頭都不够，但是他們要活才能保護地方，所以只好地方上負担起這筆款子了。涿縣一位商人吿訴我，他的一個商店每天賣十萬元左右，夥友一共十二個人，但從今年以來，已出了將達百萬元的　款。他說這樣下去年底會有多少商店關門的。震人的負担更是不能計算的，共黨徵歛，淸算，政府的攤派，田賦，一畝地一年收獲一担糧食的話，要拿出七斗米應「官差」，　然是國軍駐地，也還是不能不給共黨拿糧的，因爲除去縣城外，很少有村莊是日夜完全屬國軍的攤派以外，出夫，那是次要了。戰事起後，逃到涿縣的隣縣難民，非救不活者約計萬人，省政府雖然每　發下一千萬元的善後費，但用到急振的便不知有多少了。這些難民正期待着善救總署的救濟。</p>
<h3 id="c159">察晉綏視察記長城內外（三） <a href="#c159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>
<p>— 本報特派員　杭舟</p>
<p>我住在察哈爾大飯店二〇七號，有一隻共軍沒有携走的木櫉，打開一看，便見到一條用粉筆寫成的標語：「走向民主去」！在張垣，這樣的標語，是連厠所裏都可以發見的。　當蘇北戰事激烈的時候，我在那塊血腥的土地上旅行了三個月，對共黨的所謂『民主』，有過一番瞭解；這次我到張垣，希望獲得不同的印象。勿寗說，我希望聽到一點人民對共黨的好的批評，即使是千百分之一，亦够滿足我的好奇心。</p>
<h3 id="c160">民主的叛徒 <a href="#c160" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e160" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">160</a></h3>
<p>共黨察哈爾省政府九個委員中代表工人階級的委員黃源，原是平綏路機務所的一個工人，今年四十三歲，只念過三年書，安分守已地已經做了十八年工。共黨來時，爲表示「民主」起見，要工人選一個代表參加政府，他糊裏糊塗地被選出了，眞是做夢都沒有做過！他誠惶誠恐地當了委員，開過不少次會，但開會只吃吃茶點，或應應宴會，根本不要他發表意見，亦不可能發表意見。省政府委員會有所謂「三三制」，就是說共產黨佔三席，其餘的屬於各黨派和無黨無派。這是一套傀儡把戲，黃源便當　近一年的傀儡。好了，國軍到了張垣，黃源丟下了妻子兒女向國軍投誠，他感到良心上才有了安慰。</p>
<p>我問他：「你不怕你的妻子兒女受罪嗎？」</p>
<p>「那是沒辦法的事！」他哭喪着臉說：「　不知道她們到那兒去了！」反正的共軍警衛團團長徐陳秋，現在有了新的頭銜：察西南剿匪司令。他說：「共黨的民主邏輯是這樣的：少　服從多數利益，多數利益服從黨的利益。」因此，違背黨的利益便宜是不民主。這確是毛澤東的「新民主主義』的真精神。</p>
<p>共產黨可以非常放心的，是在所謂「解放區」內幾乎「沒有」少數利益。一個工人說：「我們不贊成亦得舉手。我們講的話像放屁。有一次，我講了幾句話，他們認爲不中聽，挨了一天一夜的吊。」一個被共黨「榮譽」地選爲參議員的醫生對我說：「第一天開會我提出了幾個議案，第二天我便受到警告，」「言論自由」是在這樣的情形下成立的：兩個共產黨員在談話，何不可竊聰。兩個朋友在街上碰見了。得請一個共產黨員站在旁邊，才能交談。就這樣，共產黨完成了他們「輝煌」的「民主政治」。</p>
<p>假使所有的人民都像牛一樣的愚蠢，指東往東，指西決不朝北，那天下不就坐定了麼？於是，共產黨在歷史的「棺材」中搬出了愚民政策，先從幹部實行起，莊稼漢，打鐵匠，殺人放火的江湖好漢，是最標準的人材。知識份子，呸！沒用的傢伙，腦筋大有問題，得澈底改造改造。一個反正的共軍連長告訴我，他就是因爲讀過幾年書，便不能做一個黨員，他始終受着冷落。</p>
<p>知識份子及年逾不惑的人却要被打進「冷宮」，甚至有遭受「嚓」的一刀的可能。因爲他們是「頑固不化的」，容易動搖的，是他們淸一色的「民主政治」障碍物。但共產黨亦有他們一根直綫的敎育。</p>
<p>一個十六歲的初中一年級生說：「我們在學校裏，先生老是敎我們學跳舞，唱秧歌。……一年的光陰耗費了，一點基木的知識都未得到。</p>
<p>「但除此之外，我們每天必得上政治課。什麽馬克斯主義啦一，八路軍的功德啦，頑固派的混蛋啦，……囉裏囉　一大套。先生來上課往往不帶課本，只敎我們讀報紙。」</p>
<p>合眾社記者張關興，提出一個問題問他：「你上了一年的政治課，能不能講一點馬克斯主義的內容呢？」</p>
<p>他笑了：「上政治課時，個人都必須到，敎室內靜到鴉雀無聲，原來大家都厭倦得睡去。——所以我現在一點都不懂」。</p>
<p>接着他說：「拆爛汚是好學生。用功的，便會受到校方的懷疑：『你是不是跟南京有關係？』</p>
<p>共黨對工人的教育亦是如此的。他們高唱「三八制」，但每天照例要多做兩點鐘工，在所謂學習的時候，便是上政治課。張垣南發電廠中有兩個工人，一個被稱爲「蒸不熟」，另一個被稱爲煮不爛」。呌做「煮不爛」的對我說：〔鈴一响，腦袋一低就得去。不去，他們會呌你是「國特』。但去了聽不聽由我。我是照例充耳不聞的，所以他們呌我做『煮不爛』。」這該是共產黨的悲哀了！</p>

<p>「鬥爭」·「算賬」·「翻身」。是共產黨三位一體的「革命」方式。名義上，好像是爭取勞苦大衆，打擊資產階級；拆穿西洋鏡，則是最惡毒的掠奪方式。</p>
<p>譬如爲世人注目的　動　農向地主發動的土地鬥爭，亦即是所謂佃農「翻身運動」，便是吸收土地的一種方式。</p>
<p>當地主被打倒以後，土地經過分配，一部分成爲公地，一部分變爲共黨有力黨員的私產，（共黨幹部不貪污，那是說給三歲孩提聽的話。）佃農得到的僅是很少的一部份。而這位新「地主」，在當佃農的時候，他繳納了租糧還可以生活，現在，他的收獲物，留給自己的如麥子，全家只准留一祖半，其餘的按「點」徵收。所謂「點」，是以一担爲單位，如收成是三担麥，除了留下的一祖五斗，還有一祖五斗便是「一點半」。徵收的時候並無標準，亦無一定的時期，有時，一點要徵收五斗，有時一個月要徵收兩次。徵收到最後的結果是：全部的收穫物，速留下的一担半在內統被徵去，或尙不足。因此「利益非所屬，又何愛於土地？「老百姓都志願不要土地，讓它荒蕪着。</p>
<p>關於算賬，有一個鷄蛋的算賬故事」：</p>
<p>八路軍問一個苦力道：　「喂！那家大戶人家有沒有向你借過錢？」</p>
<p>「老總，不要開玩笑！俺有銭借給人家，俺亦不是這　樣子了。」</p>
<p>「那末他們有沒有向你借過來　子？」</p>
<p>「他們倉裏堆的麥子一年還要爛掉許多呢！」</p>
<p>「蠢傢伙！我問你他們有沒有向你借過鷄蛋」？八路軍暴燥地聲色俱厲地問。</p>
<p>苦力怔了一下說：「鷄蛋倒是借過一個的」。</p>
<p>八路軍的眉毛揚了一下：「借了有多少時候了」？</p>
<p>「有幾年了，大槪是四年吧吧！他們做酒席，差一個鷄蛋，到俺屋裏來借的，說是明天還。明天，呃，後來他們大槪忘了。呢，呃，就祗是一個鷄蛋，沒關係！」苦力抓着頭皮說。</p>
<p>「　傢伙！一個鷄蛋可了不起啊！吿訴你，你得向他們算賬！老子跟你掙腰！」八路軍露出參差不齊的黃牙。</p>
<p>他更　　了—怎麽算呢？於是，八路軍吿訴他：一個鷄蛋，　上可以孵出一隻小鷄來，小鷄長成母鷄，一年至少要生一百個鷄蛋。一百個鷄蛋　成一百隻小鷄，小鷄再長成母鷄，一百隻母鷄一年可以生一萬個鷄蛋，蛋又　成鷄，鷄又生蛋，四年以後，一個鷄蛋，便等於幾萬隻母雞。這數目還不可觀嗎？你怎麼不跟他算？</p>
<p>苦力像茅塞頓開似地：一對啊！我還有這麽大的一筆賬放在外面呢！」</p>
<p>於是，一，二，三，算　萬歲！</p>
<p>大戶人家傾家蕩產還不是償還道四年前一個雞蛋的賬。他們逃亡出去了。苦力變成了這一份財產的主人。八路軍背着駁壳槍向他霎霎眼說：</p>
<p>「喂，傻小子！這一下可够你受用了。誰給你這樣的好處？」</p>
<p>「共產黨」！</p>
<p>「傻小子！你應該報答翁答呢！」</p>
<p>新財主又怔了一下：「老總，您怎麽說」？</p>
<p>背駁壳槍的取出一張紙條來，上面寫着：「捐獻百分之三十爲軍人生活費，百分之五十參加合作社基金。」</p>
<p>喏，就這樣你才是一個愛國份子呢」！</p>
<p>好，他還有百分之二十—至少比沒有强，他仍然很高興。</p>
<p>照例，張三得到的又要捐獻。幾次循環淸算，一切的一切都捐獻了。</p>

<p>愚昧無知的人，雖然不懂政治，休管朝代，但他們肚裏明白。他們想來想去跟着八路軍鬥爭，淸算的結果，富的固然窮了，窮的一個亦富不了，窮的得到的祗有仇恨！共產黨企圖製造人與人之間的仇恨，來鞏固他們的統治，實行他們的剝削，結果，引火自燒：富的不消說對共產黨是灤惡痛絕，而堪稱奇蹟的是窮人均對之咬牙切齒了！</p>
<p>在共產黨自己的集團中，只要是尙有一點人性的，對黨的殘暴的政策亦已深感厭惡。我和一個投誠自首的八路軍排長作過二十分鐘的談話，他怨憤地說：「在八路軍中處特殊地位的是參與長征的幹部，這批人驕橫恣慾無所不爲。」非長征幹部而地位又在營級以下的則一切受到限制，變愛結婚都不自由。相反，對於營長人上，則慫　結婚爲攏絡方式。結了婚，多了顧慮，勢必非乖乖的聽受指揮不可。</p>
<p>他壓戰，他覺得師出無名。他吿訴我：有一次，他上前綫的時候，嘆了口氣：「唉！自殘骨肉！」被政治指導員知道了，光是個別談話，再是小組批判，緊接着鬥爭。他說：「我在八路軍已有幾年，多少有些功勞，落得如此結果，我又爲何來呢？現在八路軍想反正的很多，所考慮的是不知道反正過來的國軍待他們如何？如果他們知道沒有一點苦難，那些被壓迫充砲灰的，有機會均將反正。」　我從國軍方面，獲得一封一個自殺的共軍遺書，那上面寫道：　「日本投降，我們應該享幸福，但八路軍不讓我們過好日子，到各村莊抓捕靑年來打內戰。我們打日本是有功勞的，爲的老百姓不受壓迫，現在打內戰，死了亦是無代價的。我想光榮反正，但不知國軍情祝如伺。要後退必被畏官槍斃，所以我自盡而死。八路軍同志反正逃走吧！要不然，亦是犧牲在戰場上。同志們：要想想爲誰而戰？爲誰而死！」　我在和許多農人，工人，商人，學生，反正的共軍談過話後，奇怪地問道：「難道說共產黨對你們沒有一點好處嗎？」</p>
<p>「天啊！」一個老頭子呌了起來：「共產黨有好處我還不跟它走嗎？」</p>
<p>當兵的說：「否則我不會反正了！」……</p>
<p>傅作義長官對記者團親：「共產黨的軍事失敗，是一般人的常識所能判斷出來的，而其政治失敗，如果不到張垣來，是不會相信的，尤其不會相信它的政治失敗，竟如此之慘！」</p>
<p>「共產黨的宣傳政策，一句話可以槪括：就是欺騙！」傳氏又說：「距離越遠的人，大槪對共產黨越表同情，昆明人士或者同情共產黨的人多些，天津人士就差得多了，到了張垣，就完全是對共產黨政策普遍的憎惡。所以有人說：共黨產所到的地方，就無異打了防疫針，這個地方永遠再不會有共產黨存在。」　路透社記者坎貝爾這樣發表他的感想：「我在南京聽到的，到這裏來已經證明完全錯誤了！」</p>

<h3 id="c163">外科治療是什麼 <a href="#c163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>— 藍彝</p>
<p>外科治療，在現代醫學裏，佔有特殊的地位。有些疾病，需要外科治療，方可痊愈。但是一般病人，對於外科治療，常常存着恐佈的心理，這是因爲病人的醫學常　不足，認識欠淸楚的原故。常常看見病人，雖經醫生勸吿，須用外科治療，還是猶豫不決，或亂投醫藥，希圖避免，終而延誤時日到了後來，連外科醫生，也感覺束手。所以要打破這種恐怖的心理，一定要有充分的醫學常識，才可免去無謂的犧牲。</p>
<p>外科治療是什麼？醫治疾病，常用各種治療方法，有時借重器械，施行手術，這就是外科治療，或謂手術治療，俗稱「割症」或「開刀」。但是「割症」或「開刀」的各詞，不能包括一切的外科治療，有如骨科的機械療法，也是外科治療的一種。</p>
<p>外科治療的演進：外科治療是最古療法之一，也是人類天性療法。一個刺或外物在身體上，總是被拔出去的。身體上出血，自然要用壓力來止血。這全是人類天性敎導，所謂原始時代的外科治療。後來人類，隨著經騐的增加，解剖的明瞭，與器械的發明，這種治療，就慢慢的進步，不過很少有科學上根據，還是一種技術式的療法。現代科學倡明，蒸蒸日上，醫學進展，也兆常的迅速。利用科學硏究的結果，如病理，細菌，生理生理化學，及藥理等學的進步，並藉　器械的精良，參用試騐外科的結果，外科治療的範圍，也比百年前廣大的多了。</p>
<p>外科治療的範圍</p>
<p>（一）在外科治療中，大多數是屬於急症，帶着危險狀態，身體每不能戰勝，惟有藉着立時外科治療，才能保全生命。創傷裏有大血管出血，若不用人工去止血就能致死的。內臟受傷，更爲嚴重”若不立刻縫補或處置，絕無生望。有時身患疾病，忽然發生危急症狀，如傷寒症腸穿孔胃潰痬穿孔，白喉性的氣管閉寒等等，非立即施行外科治療，暫時解除致命危險，不能保全生命。這種外科治療，雖不是直接的醫治傷寒症，胃潰煬或白喉，也是除去一個重要的症狀。</p>
<p>（二）現代城市裏，一切以機械化方法爭取時間，以致外傷日益增多。早期創傷，傳染的細菌，尙未及　殖，可施行擴創術，不但能整復傷口，縮短愈程，並可免去因細菌傳染，憂延其他組織的後患。身體骨折，必須外科治療。骨折會自己痊愈的，但因筋肉的張力，能使骨　　更原來位置，以致斷肢縮短，變爲畸形，終成殘疾。外科用機械方法，來引導固定骨折，使筋肉不致縮短，並恢復正常部位，則斷肢愈後，可動作如常。其因某種疾病，而使身體變成畸形的，外科治療，亦可預防或矯正。</p>
<p>（三）身體部分的炎症，多數是由細菌傳染所致。有的須施行外科治療，不但可縮短病期，也可除去危險。一個　腫，日久會日己出腺的，但是出　越慢，病期便要延長，每一個潰爛病　，都有使細菌傳入血液的可能，而成血中毒症。若能早期切開排　一，可免此種危險。外科治療，不過一是順着天然程序，縮短病期，也可節省病人的體力。闌尾（俗稱一育腸）發炎，也許不施行手術，一就能自愈，不過也許化膿或破裂一以致變成腹膜炎，那就非常的危一險。若是在化膿或破裂以前，早期將發炎的闌尾割去，不但可除去病　，完全治愈，也可免去極大的化膿或破裂的危險，身體其他不重要的器官，也可得病，如果用比較安全的療法，失其效果，不得已可用外科治療，這也看能否影響身體的機能而決定的。</p>
<p>（四）身體對於外物的侵入，並非沒有保護的反應。一粒槍彈在體內，也能被纖微組織包圍起來，存在體內幾十年不會發生危險。一個木刺在體內，引起化膿，也可隨着膿液排出來。但是外物存留在體內，要是妨礙重要器官或機能，也應當用外科治療，將他除去，免遺後患，有如腎石，膀胱石，膽石等，全以摘除爲宜。</p>
<p>（五）瘤腫是體內組織病理的形態，也同異物一樣。但是藉着身瞼的血液營養，才能增長，所以對於健康很是不利的。良性瘤腫，有時不會使病人感覺得痛苦，但是生長太大，地位不宜，也能妨礙身體，應當早早割去爲妥，惡性瘤腫，更是直接有害於身體，並能危及生命。多數的惡性瘤腫，因爲症狀不甚明顯，有時很難發覺。等到病人自行發覺出來，大多數已竟太晚。所以身體某方面，如果稍覺不正常，總以早到醫生處檢査爲妥。有時需要藉用X光檢査，才能診斷出來。對於治療，近來雖有鐳的發現，可用以治療惡性瘤腫，惟以用途不廣，普通還是用外科治療。早期治療，可免去瘤腫細胞轉移到體內他處，而使全身受損。所以治療結果良吾，全靠珍斷早晚爲標準。</p>
<p>外科治療的安全問題？得病應該早醫，是人人知道的。就是外科治療的安全問題，也是與就醫時間的早晚，有密切關係。就醫愈早，外科安全愈多。如果得了外科的病，還是求神拜佛，卜籤占卦，或吃一二劑湯藥，希望治好，這樣的天天延誤下去，就無形的减少外科治療的安全。所以得病早醫，可以得到早期的外科治療，那就解決了病人安全問題。對於安全問題，旣然認識得淸楚，也就沒有恐怖的心理了。</p>
<h3 id="c164">談月經 <a href="#c164" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e164" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">164</a></h3>
<p>— 劉本立</p>
<p>女子有月經是一個普遍的生理現象。讀者對於月經這個名詞一定不感生疏。但是月經到底是什麽一回事？和它發生連帶關係的又有些什麽情形？我們即或去問親身經歷的女士們，明瞭這些問題的人恐怕也不多。簡單的說起來，月經是一種週期性的子宮血液排泄，除了懷孕時期之外，它大致是有規則的發生着。</p>
<p>月經的機構</p>
<p>要討論月經，我們先要　瞭月經的來源。月經雖然是子宮的排泄，但是它的統制權却操在卵巢的手裏。沒有卵巢，子宮就不能產生月經。卵巢是小腹內兩個白果大小的組織。女子發身後，它就開始活動，每月造成一個卵泡。大約在月經週期的第寸四天，這個卵泡就成熟而自動破裂。把它裏面藏　的一枚人卵送出來。這個破裂的卵泡就變成了黃體。黃體有安胎的作用如果精虫和卵子這時沒有會合，定在十四天之後也自動消滅。隨　就是行經期。這樣就造成了一個二十八天的週期。卵泡和黃體都有它們各別的內分泌素來管理子宮的組織而調節月經的週期。失了正常作用的卵巢就會影響到月經。</p>
<p>不過月經的機構並不是這樣簡單，因爲卵巢和別的內分泌腺有着密切的關係，尤其是腦下墜腺和甲狀腺。紊亂的內分泌系統會影響到卵巢的功能，簡接的就擾亂了月經。</p>
<p>月經的一般現象</p>
<p>正常的女子應該有定期行經。平均的計算是二十八天行經一次。但是很少女子會絕對的準確。兩三天的差別不能算不正常。經期的久暫也是各人不同，兩天到六天的行經都是正常。時間過長或過短都應該加以注意。</p>
<p>月經是一種不易凝結的血液。血液的多少是一件很難測量的事情，尤其是各它隨人而各異的。從閒接的證據，我們推測正常的女子每决的月經的有三十到一百二十西西之排泄。太多或太少常是疾病的指徵。許多人認爲月經是一種汚穢之物，多流一點沒有關係。但是如果從她們的血管裏取五西西的，她們會害怕貧血。這確實是錯誤的見解。五西西的血決不能損傷一個人，大量的月經無疑的會造成貧血。</p>
<p>有一部份的女子在行經期時毫無異常的感覺。但是還有不少的女子會感覺到一種或多種的不舒適。最普通的一種就是痛經。據美國的統計，大的有一半的女子有這種現象，雖然疼痛的程度不同。痛經的治療不很簡單，因爲它的起因很多。大的有一半的原發性痛經可以假生產得到痊愈。</p>
<p>其他的症狀例如頭痛。腹漲·疲倦·易怒。乳漲等也是常見的事。</p>
<p>月經開始和結束</p>
<p>女子初次行經的年齡不一，它常隨人隨地而不同的。平均的年齡在十二歲到十六歲之間。在較熱的地方月經發生得較早；在較冷的地方月經發生得較遲。我國的女子普通在十四歲到十五歲時就開始行經。過了這個年齡還沒有月經是須要診視的提示。</p>
<p>平均的說起來，女子的月經的有三十年之久。到四十五歲前後就不再有月經。當然例外是有的。據一般的統計，我們知道行經早的女子有較遲的經絕；行經遲的女子反而會早些沒有月經。</p>
<p>經絕并不是一個突然的現象。它它往往需要幾個月到三年的工夫才能達到完全沒有月經的階段。在過渡的時期中，月經常常不規則，週期或是縮短或是延長。月經量也或是增加或是减少。這個時期需要切實的注意，因爲足以致命的子宮　癌症常常是這個時期發生，而它的症狀會同上述的情形一樣。</p>
<p>在經絕的過渡時期內，有很多人會感覺到多種的不舒適。最普通的是精神和循環系統的不安定，如悲觀·易怒·疲倦·體感微熱和斷續的臉紅。大量的白帶也常會在這個時期發生。這些並不是嚴重的情形，不過它們增加了許多生活的煩惱。治療並不困難，適量的卵泡素就可以解決一切。</p>
<p>經閉的原因</p>
<p>經閉和經絕不同。後者是生理必然的過程，而前者是懷孕或疾病的象徵。</p>
<p>在生殖期的女子，經閉往往是懷孕的指示。但是我們却不能說每一個經閉的女子都是懷孕。還有許多情形也會造成經閉的。</p>
<p>情感的刺激（如極度的忿怒悲哀快樂緊張和驚嚇）和環境的更變（如旅行易地居住和氣候的改變）都是可能的原因。這些不需要特殊的治療。月經往往會自已恢復正常。</p>
<p>有多種疾病如結核症肺炎和傷寒症等常造成經閉，因爲這些疾病降低了健康。體質衰弱的女子就會經閉。所以治療的目標在增强體質。</p>
<p>陰道阻塞多數是因爲處女膜無穿孔，通俗稱之爲「石女」。這種女子並不是沒有月經，而是月經的出口被阻塞了。這種情形的診斷，至爲明顯。治療當然是除去阻塞。</p>
<p>內分泌系統的不平衡也是一個很普通的起因。主要的內分泌腺如腦下隊腺甲狀腺如卵巢的變化皆足以影響月經到經閉的程度。發育不全的子宮不能出產月經，因爲內分泌腺沒有給它能力生長到成人的子。患惡性甲狀腺肥大症的女子宮，經閉是極平常的附帶情形。到現在爲止，內分泌系統還是一個不完全明瞭的科學，所以治療上也最感棘手。</p>
<p>不規則月經</p>
<p>一般人很難分別不規則的月經和子宮流血。眞正的不規則月經有兩種起因：一種是內分泌系統失調，一種是子宮肌瘤。前面已經述及內分泌性的經閉問題。在不同的失調程度之下，這些內分泌腺不引起經閉而造成不規則的月經。子宮肌瘤能改變子宮的組織。子宮是月經的發源地，所以月經就被擾亂了。治療的成功要靠診斷的準確性，尤其要和下列的子宮流血情形分別淸楚：</p>
<p>（一）懷孕併發症，如流產，前置胎盤，餘剩胎盤和葡萄胎等。</p>
<p>（二）子宮炎症，如子宮頸炎，子宮內膜炎和輸卵管炎等。</p>
<p>（三）惡性子宮瘤症，如子宮頸癌和子宮體癌症等。</p>
<p>（四）卵巢炎和卵巢瘤症</p>
<p>月經期的衛生</p>
<p>月經帶以柔軟和富有吸收力的物質爲最相宜。平常的應用應該限於外用。除了數小時的短時期取其便利外，放置在陰道裏的方法應該避免使用。</p>
<p>月經期內最好洗熱水淋浴，目的在避免浴水浸入陰道和子宮內而引起發炎。長時期的熱水坐溶很不適宜，因爲那樣足以增加局部充血，因而增加排泄量。冷水浴和游泳應該禁止，因爲那樣可能引起突然的月經巾止和慢性的小腹不適。</p>
<p>在月期經運動並沒有什麼不宜。不過疲勞和劇烈的運動應該避免。尤其是有許多女子在這個時期感覺到不舒適。這樣的女子應該多多休息。</p>
<p>月經期內應該避免性交，因爲性交也可能傳染病菌。不過它的危險性並沒有一般人所想像的那樣嚴重。</p>

<p>昆蟲動物之最易傳播疾病者，主要爲（一）蒼蠅，（允其是家蠅），（二）蚊蟲（允其是瘧蚊），（三）虱子（允其是體虱，（四）跳蚤（尤其是鼠蚤），皆在自然世界繁殖甚衆，吾人欲完全撲滅之，在目前尙難辦到，但依下列方法做去，亦可大收抑制之效。</p>
<p>A滅蠅——蠅之學生地，，主要爲人糞獸糞及含有腐爛植物之垃圾穢物，滅蠅之上策在防止其孳生，撲滅其幼蟲，至於成蠅之防滅，則較難爲力也。</p>
<p>（一）蒼蠅學生之防止及其幼蟲之撲滅。</p>
<p>（一）人獸糞便及垃圾之集中的合理處置。</p>
<p>（二）糞便垃圾之按期淸除。</p>
<p>（三）蠅蛆之殺滅。</p>
<p>B蠅之防滅</p>
<p>（一）用紗窗，紗簾，紗罩以防避飛蠅。</p>
<p>（二）用蠅拍　　捕蠅紙之　，以捕殺飛蠅。</p>
<p>（三）用藥物滅蠅：如DDT，除虫菊等。</p>
<p>B滅蚊——蚊蟲之生地，悉限於有水之處，但無論鄕間城市，室內戶外，有水之處極多，故蚊蟲之完全撲滅亦極難，然足以傳播疾病之蚊蟲，　屬亦不過多，在中國以傳染　疾之　蚊爲主，在各省所己發現者不一，計有二十四種，及七亞種。各種瘧蚊之學生地及其生活習性互異，欲謀撲滅　蚊，應先事調査當地以何種瘧蚊爲傳播瘧疾之蚊，其孳生塲所何在，習性如何，然後再進行計劃撲滅，庶不致勞而無功，費而鮮效。</p>
<p>滅蚊之方法甚多，要常審察當地當時之情况，而選擇適宜方法。滅蚊方法之槪要如下</p>
<p>A蚊蟲　生之防止及其幼蟲之撲滅</p>
<p>（一）積水之排除</p>
<p>（二）窪地的塡塞與貯水器的加蓋。</p>
<p>（三）蚊蟲幼蟲的殺滅：採用藥劑。</p>
<p>B成蚊之防滅</p>
<p>（一）用蚊帳紗窗紗簾以防飛蚊，每吋有十六個孔眼的紗綱，即足防阻　蚊。</p>
<p>（二）川蚊拍蚊　以捕殺飛蚊，或以牲畜誘避之——有幾種　蚊，酷嗜牲畜之血甚於人血</p>
<p>用藥物殺滅或驅除飛蚊：如DDT等。</p>
<p>C滅虱——虱爲人體之外寄生蟲，又可以傳播回歸熱斑疹傷寒及戰壕熱等病，吾人如能時常沐浴更衣，保持淸潔，則虱子根本不能立足於人體，惟以一般社會經濟狀况之惡劣，西南西北蒙藏等地給水之困難，及一部份軍隊監獄之不易維持淸潔，乃致虱子甚爲普遍。改進淸潔狀况，自爲治本的辦法，治標的滅虱方法，可分頭虱體虱兩項言之：</p>
<p>A頭虱的撲滅</p>
<p>（一）剃光頭髮。</p>
<p>（二）梳　除蚤——虱卵黏着於髮，可先以稀釋的硼砂水或來沙兒洗　之，即可滅除。</p>
<p>（三）用藥物殺滅——D．D．T．製劑，功效甚佳。</p>
<p>B虱的撲滅——體虱附　於衣被等處，沐浴之後，更以新衣，體自無虱，但表被等物，應予以滅蟲處置，始無後患。普通均以熱力或　物殺滅之。</p>
<p>C滅蚤——跳蚤中以鼠蚤爲最有危險性，滅除鼠蚤，應同時滅鼠（見前），始克　效。滅蚤方法，可用D．D．T．製劑，收效甚佳。</p>
<p>抵抗力之增強</p>
<p>傳染病之病源，每難兀全抑制；其傳染途徑，亦未必盡可切斷，尤以呼吸道傳染病爲然。是以人體抵抗力之增高，實爲吾人戰勝病菌之最後的重要防綫。此可分普通抵抗力的加强與特殊抵抗力的產生兩項言之：</p>
<p>（九）普通抵抗力的加强——改進營養及一般健康</p>
<p>A抵抗病菌的侵襲——吾人已知病菌侵入人體的主要途徑爲粘膜，皮膚，及昆蟲媒介。皮膚可保持完整，昆蟲不屬於人體範圍，無庸置論。獨此粘膜（呼吸道消化道等），恒爲病菌侵襲之大門，吾人將何以防堵之，使病菌不能立足於粘膜或不能滲透粘膜而進襲？惜　人關於此方面之硏究，尙感不足。所知者，不過長良好營養，尤其是充足的甲　維生素，與粘膜的局部抵抗力有關，病灶（如　　膜炎　　等）之截除，足以恢復原已降低之粘膜抵抗力而已。</p>

<p>范成大在十二世紀曾知明州，那就是現在的浙江鄞縣。倫敦時報文學副刋評者說他曾任「四川節度使，聚集了許多詩人任用他們，而他自己是其中最大的詩人」，那恐怕是誤認范成大爲陸游了吧？該文又說：「這是范成大在六十歲時，罷官不做，在閒適時寫的。」按該詩序云：「淳熙丙午，沉疴少紓，復至石湖舊隱，野外即事，輙書」絕，終歲得六十首，號四時田園雜與。」淳熙丙午即西曆一一八六年，他生於一一二六，照西洋人的算法，可說是六十歲，中國算法該是六十一歲，這還不能算錯。</p>
<p>布勒特自己說他的譯詩是富有經騐的。他把范成大所寫的農業年的明顯而又絕美的文字畫介紹給英美人士了。他介紹給他們的是四季的現象，鄕里的各種居民和風俗習慣。他說得很熱誠眞摯，他對於飲食說得比英美農民詩人要注重一些。</p>
<p>因爲范成大對於大自然精細的研究，造就他那超特的詩的風格，評者認爲不容他不介紹一點。范成火能使任何事物變成愉悅的詩料。下面這一首足爲中國農業日屑的代表作；</p>
<p>「在許多畝荷花中央，</p>
<p>我搖着船，放着槳。</p>
<p>遮沒路徑的是一堆花，</p>
<p>直到晚間我都忘了回家。</p>
<p>等在那兒的人們很是淸楚</p>
<p>雖然看不見船在何處。</p>
<p>那裏，他們總望着那裏，</p>
<p>小水烏忽然受驚飛起。」</p>
<p>其實這八句詩在漢文原文只有四句，見於夏日田園雜興之十：</p>
<p>「千頃芙　放棹嬉，</p>
<p>花深迷路晚忘歸。</p>
<p>家人暗識船行處，</p>
<p>時有驚忙小鴨飛。」</p>
<p>五四運動後不久，葉紹鈞顧頡剛王伯祥這三位蘇州人合編初中國語敎科書（此之謂蘇州人打官話，一笑），首光選了范成大這六十首中的十餘首詩，打破昔人專選古文之例，以後陳陳相因，各課本都採用，於是中學生們也有機會欣賞這位田園詩人的詩。現在經布勒特譯成英文，可說石湖詩更爲普遍，連英美人都知道了。因爲在這以前，如A.　Waley譯「一百七十首詩」，H.　Giles譯「中國文學萃珍」，Fletcher譯「唐詩選集」和「唐詩選續集」，都特別注重唐代及其以前的詩人，很少有注意到范成大的。</p>
<h3 id="c167">關於簡素生活 <a href="#c167" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e167" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">167</a></h3>
<p>— 習喜</p>
<p>十九世紀末年繁華之巴黎市中出版了一部論文，專討論簡素生活。在那個時候，已經感覺到世界文明走過了頭，再要回到簡索生活，簡直是大愚不靈。不過這部書的作者以爲不然，照他的意思，簡素就是趨向人生最高鵠的之實踐，而並不是與現實相背馳的。現代的人生，從墮地以至人土，無時無刻不在激烈緊張作蘭自縛之中，就是游戲，也沒有什麽眞正的好懷，就是死，也得不到安穩的死，尤其是富者階級爲虛榮，野心，及不正常的享受所驅使播弄，實在徒然令人哀憫。不錯，爲衣食不能不奮鬥，但必需的衣食以外，營營擾擾的又是爲什麽呢？他舉出簡素思想，簡素言詞，簡素欲望，簡素娛樂，簡素美觀幾項，眞不啻在紙醉金迷的街市中湧出一股淸冽甘和的幽泉，使人塵襟頓浣。</p>
<p>著者何人？華格納CharlesWagnar　是也。他以一八五二年生於後來被德國合併而又退還的亞爾薩斯。他孕育於宗敎的家庭，幽美的自然環境。他自己每說野花山鳥白石流泉最是夢寐所不忘的童時游釣之鄉。早年喪父，十四歲人巴黎求學，畢業後赴德深造，大受德國哲人之影響，及亞省割併以後，他更致力於法國語言文字，一生從事宗敎敎育，演講著述，勤勤不倦。其深刻之觀察得力於幼年從鄕村乍入都市的經騐，其誠摯之同情則得力於遺傳的信仰，所以他的議論對於人世上種種情僞變作癡愚苦惱確有敏銳的體騐，而又以溫婉忠厚之性情發爲愷惻動人的勸導，並不隨意加人以苛責，而反給人以活潑的溫情。他同情於勞動階級，曾爲勞動的組織與聚會而受猜疑，但是他並不認爲對立的力量是不能調協的，他曾經有過下列一段名言：</p>
<p>我徼幸得很，在我的靈魂中，能將多少好像敵對的力量調和起來而成爲一個，我所共同生活的，有窮有富，有智有愚，有市人有村農，有信敎者有無神者，有德國人有法國人，有過去人物有現代人物，我都了解他們，而且一樣的愛他們。</p>
<p>在這部名著的序文中，他說：</p>
<p>患熱病的人夢想沈浸於甘泉之樂，現代生活如此的緊張煩擾也應當寤寐縈廻於簡素生活。所謂簡素生活並不是靠外在環境來造成的，並不是過去的，無寗說可以是生活更活潑更多變化，所以可以拿他來當一個人生最崇高的鵠的。我們的牛活方式雖然與我們的高曾不同，但精神是一樣的，人生所尋求的究竟爲什麽呢？今天與昨大還是一樣啊！可惜我們爲歧途所誤以致於自尋煩惱而已。</p>
<p>在他的第一章討論煩擾的塵宸，他有一段極詼諧的描敍。</p>
<p>某女士定於星期二結婚，今天已經星期五了。　禮的，做衣裳的，裝飾屋子的，辦酒席的，賣首飾的，五花八門，應接不暇，好容易安排有了頭緒，又要趕緊換衣出席各種儀式的宴會。（按法國風俗有與吾國舊禮相似的，如納徵納采之類。）深夜歸來，疲勞萬分，又是一大堆的信，等着拆看，其中有的是道喜的，有的是說委辦的事萬來不及的，有的是說祖任儐相或知賓礙難如命的，形形色色不一而足，有付之一笑的，有大費躊躇的。像這種情形，已經差不多一個月了，簡直片刻的寗靜休息都得不着。唉！這不是活受罪麼？幸而還好，祖老太太年紀將近八十了，她自己有一間臥房，她業經受盡了人生的煩擾而現在總算能寂然安坐以度餘年。這一家的人仰馬翻，到了她的房門口暫時消逝了。因爲大家不敢驚動她老人家，說話走路都要小聲的。一對新人好不容易躱到她老人家房間裏，方才喘得一口氣，老太太說道：「可憐的娃娃呀！你們太乏了，，歇一會罷，兩口兒講講體己話罷，不要爲那些無謂的事煩心了，那是不値得的。這個世界太複雜了，不能爲人添快樂，徒然使人更愁苦啊！」這話眞使一雙新人如晨鐘驚夢，不錯，的確前幾天他兩口子還爲一點無謂的小事而幾乎影響愛情，而且還不只一次呢！</p>
<p>描寫將結婚的愛侶爲虛榮的習俗所糾纏之痛苦，誰能不爲之同情？</p>

<h3 id="c169">馮夢龍的「廣笑府」 <a href="#c169" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e169" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">169</a></h3>
<p>— 復君</p>
<p>我國自古以來的笑話書，爲數實在不少，從最早的兩部笑話書：後漢邯鄲淳的「笑林」和附侯白的「啓顏錄」算起，一直到了現代，又何止數十種。可是在這數十種的笑話書中，要以明朝馮夢龍的「廣笑府」最爲可觀；無論編制方面，或是材料的取捨方面，都要以馮夢龍的這一部笑話書最合我們的理想。</p>
<p>馮夢龍筆名　憨蕭主人。襟霞閣刋本，「廣笑府」即署此名。列爲國學珍本文庫第一集第七種，係民國二十五年出版。「廣笑府」序文曰：「古今來莫非話也，話莫非笑也。兩儀之混汕開闢，列聖之揖讓征誅，見者其誰耶？夫亦話之而已耳。後之話今，亦猶今之話昔，話之而疑之，可笑也，話之而信之，允可笑也。經書之史，鬼話也，而爭傳焉。詩賦文章，淡話也，而爭工焉。褒譏伸抑，亂話也，而爭趨進焉。或笑人，或笑於人，笑人者亦復笑於人，笑於人者亦復笑人，人之相笑密有已時？廣笑府，集笑話也，十三編猶云薄乎云爾。或閱之而喜，請勿喜，或閱之而嗔，請勿嗔。堯與舜，你讓天子，我笑那湯與武，你奪天子，他道是沒有個傍人兒覷，覷破了這意思兒也不過是個十字街頭小經紀。還有什麽龍比逢干伊和呂，也有什麼巢父許由夷與齊，只這般唧唧噥噥的，我也那裏工夫笑着你。我笑那李老聃五千言的道德，我笑那釋迦佛五千卷的文字，乾惹得那些道士門去打雲鑼，和尙們去打木魚，弄兒窮活計，那曾有什麼靑牛的道理，白牛的滋味，怪的又惹出那達磨老臊胡來，把這些乾屎撅的渣兒，嚼了又嚼，洗了又洗，又笑那孔子的老頭兒，你絮叨叨說什麽通學文章，也平白地把好些活人都弄死。又笑那張道陵許旌陽，你便白日昇天也成何濟，只這些未了精精兒到底來也只是一淘寃苦的鬼。住住住！還有一古今世界一大笑府，我與若皆在其中供話柄，不話不成人，不笑不成話，不笑不話不成世界。布袋和尙，吾師乎，吾師乎，墨憨齋主人題。」</p>
<p>「廣笑府」共分十四卷，前十三卷爲笑話，後一卷曰：「隱話」，所謂「隱語」，就是「謎語」，實在是本書的一個附錄。卷一「儒箴」四十九篇，卷二「官箴」二十七篇，卷三「九流」二十三篇，卷四「方外」十五篇，卷五「口腹」六十八篇，卷六「風懷」二十四篇，卷七「貪吞」九篇，卷八「尙氣」二十五篇，卷九，「偏駁」三十八篇，卷十「嘲謔」四十一篇，卷十一「諷諫」十九篇，卷十二「形體」十六篇，卷十三「雜記」九篇，卷十四「隱語」三十九篇。除卷十四「隱語」因係「謎語」，不能說是笑話以外，十三卷共收笑話三百六十三篇。最長的笑話，每篇有長至八九十字的，最短的短至僅有一二十字左右。</p>
<p>用字簡鍊，語法自然，是「廣笑府」的特色。而每當我們讀了一篇之後，不但啓顏發噱而已，益且使我們感覺到一種强烈的諷刺的情調。茲舉數篇於後：</p>
<p>「新官赴任，向吏胥曰：做官事體當如何？更曰：一年要淸，二年半淸，三年便混。官歎曰：敎我如何敖得到第三年。」（卷二官箴第十二篇「新官赴任向例」）</p>
<p>「一官府生辰，吏聞其屬鼠，醵黃金鑄一鼠爲壽。官喜曰：汝知奶奶生辰亦在日下乎？奶奶是屬牛的。」（卷工官箴第二十六篇「屬牛」）</p>
<p>「一新嫁娘者，途中哭泣其哀，轎夫不忍曰：小娘子，且抬你轉去如何？女應曰：如今不哭了！」（卷六風懷第十五篇「不哭」）</p>
<p>「女初出閣，正哀哭間，轎夫覓槓不得，乃帶哭曰：我的娘，轎槓在門角裏！」（卷六風懷第十七篇一覓轎槓」）</p>
<p>我們讀了這些笑話，那能不而嗔，請勿嗔」呢。</p>
<p>所以依我看來，馮夢龍「廣笑府」中許多短小精悍的笑話，以之與近代所謂西洋幽默（Humor）相比較，實在也是有過之而無不及的。</p>

<p>— 葉勁風</p>
<p>怎麽辦？略一尋思，我立即跑到汽車停車塲那裏，想找到一根小繩之類的東西；預備把手槍子彈的火藥，絞在繩裏，做一段引火繩，像土人打臘川的引火繩一樣，雖是算不準燃燒的正確時刻，却也將就用得。訛知找去找來，單單找不着這種東西。我忙打了暗號，呌虎也來帮着找。</p>
<p>誰知虎弟剛跑過來，陡然聽見那擴聲器又「篤，篤，」饗了幾下。剛發出怪聲呌着「啊呃」的當口，同時那立體建築頂上，一剎放出好幾條探照燈光。對面東邊營房，也起了騷動，人聲之外，還夾着狗聲，好像有十多匹狗的狺狺低嗥。尤其可惡的是那嗚嗚鬼呌一般的警報，也響動了。僥倖那些探照登，竟沒有一雙照到我們這裏。</p>
<p>其實，我們只須放出一兩　　汽油，也很够引起大火，無奈心下恨透倭鬼；心想多耗他一池油，也讓他們心口多痛一會。却不知這麽一來，把我們寳貴的時間，也多耗去了至少二十分種。有這二十分鐘功夫，我們很可從容辦事，恐怕早已弄好，人也走了。但是現在追悔，又有何益？</p>
<p>這警報一響，任是如何老練的人，也元自有些驚心動魄。在這千鈞一髮時間內，千萬不能錯動一步。設若神志一亂，也許我們眞要搶車，開槍，奪路衝走了。但現在還沒有到那地步，所以我仍舊沉住氣，思索一會，又耳目並）用，探探他們着手搜尋的動向。</p>
<p>「小姨，您要找那繩子幹嗎？……這裏揸布很多，撕成條兒一擰，……</p>
<p>這孩子思想如此敏捷，心竅如此伶俐別透，眞呌人可愛。不過他沒有知道，麻繩着火，不易熄滅，布條擰成的繩子，雖說夾上火藥，不是燒得太快，就是容易熄減；但也是無辦法中的辦法，可以試試。在三分鐘內，我們就把這引火繩弄好，揀了一個最適合的地方，安置起來，繩的尾端，還堆積一小堆火藥。看看佈置妥當了，這才拿出自來火來，把火引着。一瞧表，正十點五分。</p>
<p>「快走罷！」我指着正西。我估計翻過這煤堆砲位，跨過一段空塲，鑽過叢林，跨過大路，越過石牆，渡過那一道溪水，至少也得十來分鐘。</p>
<p>「站住……加！」我們剛要動身，猛然聽得像同雷一般，一個沙拉粗暴的聲音，從我們後面叱喝着。</p>
<p>日人的行動，大概十九不脫一個「詭」字。祗看這裏，探照燈都集中在築建前部；人，狗，一排排，一隊一隊，也順着大路往前部走去，認爲他們是以這衛區的前部爲目標，進行搜索。雖說他們把全部報警搜索的設備－探照燈，擴聲器，警報筒，人，狗，等等，全部發動，也祇認爲日人一向喜歡大驚小怪，所以我們還專心致意，在這裏工作；誰知這路還鑽出這麼一個東西？</p>
<p>一聽了叱喝聲，我同虎弟，立時出槍轉身。誰知那傢伙手上，却是一隻手提機關。</p>

<h3 id="c173">秘密電臺的對頭　電波偵察機 <a href="#c173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>— 麥葉</p>
<p>上月廿一日本報市聞版頭條新聞記載：淞滬警備司令部最近利用小型電波偵察機，在江寗路破獲一所非法的秘密無綫電台。</p>
<p>大家都曉得：無綫電波不過是充滿宇宙間「以太」的波動，我們眼視之無色，手觸之無形，那末，「電波偵察機」到底怎樣去偵察呢？這原理說出來也很易懂，不過我們先要記着，普通被一似察到的多是發報站而不是收報一站，幸而一般的秘密電台有百分一之九十都是邊收邊發，當它發報的時候，這「電波偵察機」就可以像獵犬般追蹤電波來源，終而尋到發電台的所在。——更正確地說，偵察到發報機相連的「天綫」所在地。秘密電台的「天錢」，有時假裝像普通廣播無綫電收音機的「天綫」而伸展在室外或屋頂，但也有藏在室內即所謂「室內天綫」的。</p>
<p>讀者或許還記得：十五年前最初有廣播無綫電時那收音機和現在的如何逈然不同。那時播音用的喇叭筒並不藏在收音機的內部，而所用的天錢，除了象現在的「室外天綫」以外，還盛行過一時「室內天綫」，後者是把長長的一條銅綫繞在一個小型十字架上，看起來怪像個蜘蛛網，或者咱們特有的「八卦岡」。這環狀的「室外天綫」有點奧妙，因寫那十字架是裝在一根可以左右旋轉的「軸心」上，所以這「八掛圖」就很容易轉動而朝向東南四北之任何一個方向。不過我們要注意，在轉動它方向時，對於某個播音台或發報台，它祇有朝　　一個方向，那聽進來的音樂或電碼符號才聲音最爲淸楚和聲　最大。爲什麼呢？因爲依照這天綫這時所朝向的方向），以收音機所在地爲　點，若在地圖上劃一條同樣方向的直綫，那播音台或發報台就在這根直綫之上。——「電波偵察機」的原理也是如此。</p>
<p>不過，用一條天綫和一座收　機祇可約略的知道播音台或發報台是坐落何方，換句話說，這時祇能曉得發報台是在地圖上所畫出那一根直綫之上，究竟它在收報站之前抑後，左抑右，還是不得而知，因爲前與後，或左與右都是在一根直綫之上。這樣，還談不到那秘密電台到底是在這一根「延之無窮」的直綫上某一　點」（地點）。</p>
<p>問題的澈底解決也極容易，丹增設一個收報站和一根方向可變的天綫魷可以了。憑　第二條天錢依同理所探索到電波最強的方向，在地圖上，通過第二個收報站所在地的基點再劃一條直綫，前後兩直綫必然不是「平行」，那末，按諸幾何學原理，這兩條綫，必有一個「交點」，而「交點」即「X」的中心，就是秘密電台的所在地了！</p>
<p>簡單地說：所謂「電波偵察機」實際上不過包括一條方向可以轉動的天綫，和一座略似於普通的收報機，不過它除了「聽筒」即「耳機」以外，還有一個極精密極敏感的「微量電流計」，從這電表上能擺動的指針，就看出天綫轉動到那一個方向時，收進來的電波訊號最强，因而推知秘密電台是座落那一個方向了。</p>
<p>偵探用的「電波偵察機」大多數是把一套機件和一根天綫裝在一部小汽車裏面，所以它本身是可以移動的。在出動偵察時之前，第一步要它發覺秘密電台的「波長」，因爲每個合法的電台，都有一個被當局指定的「波長」，不能私自變更。而各電台的「彼長」亦彼此不同。負責偵査非法電台的機關，假如在收報機上聽到某電台的電波「波長」，在登記表上是沒有的，那就必然要　手「追蹤」。第二，每個合法的電台都有一個各不相同的「呼號」，好像每個人有各不相同的名字，而這「呼號」也是管理電訊當局所指定的。按照法規，發報臺在開始或完結了一通電碼時，必要報明自己的「呼號」好幾次，才合國際手續。假如聽到某一個電台並沒有這樣的「自我介紹」說出自己的名字（即「呼號」），無疑的，這也是非法電台，而必需進一步「追蹤」。</p>
<p>「電波偵察機」對可疑的電台出動了。普通都是兩三部「偵察機」分頭出動，彼此之間用近距離的小型無綫電報機隨時連絡，因爲這樣，可以「事半功倍」。幾部電波偵察機和幾條轉動天綫同裝在一架小汽車上的也有，不過，無論車上裝的機件是一部或多部，汽車外表和普通的看起來並無差異。</p>
<p>精密和熟練的探索有時可在幾十分鐘內就破獲到一個秘密電台的所在，不只是某街某弄某號門牌，一淸二楚，甚至這一幢房子的哪一層樓，這　樓的前廳或後頭亭子間是秘密電台的隱藏處，亦不難一一偵知，其奧妙也不過是變更「偵察機」的天綫的「仰角」因而獲悉。</p>
<p>這原理的利用，除了上述偵察非法電台的「電波偵察機」以外，還有在濃霧巾藉電波方向來領導船舶進港，或者吿知迷途的飛機以所在地，甚至引頒它安全飛回基地。</p>
<p>據說，美國在珊瑚礁上兩次試騐原子彈，動用許多架機上沒有駕駛人員而由無綫電波操縱的飛機，這一隊隊機羣之能够飛返基地，也是用無綫電訊號來引領方向的。又如第二次世界大戰新武器之一的「雷達」吧，它一部份原理，和這裏所說的「電波偵察機」也是相似的。</p>

<p>問：正方形狀的黃金，要如何大小才能有一噸重？</p>
<p>答：一個十四英吋正方形立體的黃金，重約一千九百廿磅——一噸弱。</p>
<p>問：金鋼鑽會不會從天上落下來？</p>
<p>答：會的——經過若干時候，就會有一次發生。因爲在流星中有大量的金鋼鑽存在着。並且有好幾個滿是金鋼　的小流星和隕石是已被發現了。</p>
<p>問：一個人在行動中是不是比立停時較重？</p>
<p>答：是的，行動時較重。舉個例來說，一個人突然的跳起來，可以使他自己的重量加一倍——那祇是關於磅秤上的重量。</p>
<p>問：一個人筆直的站立着，被人在腦後撃中一槍，他是向那一個方向倒下去的？</p>
<p>答：無論那槍彈從什麽地方開過來，那個人總是向前的倒下去的，也許是因爲人類的祖先也是爬行的緣故。</p>
<p>問：煤氣（Gas）在什麼時就有候，誰最先用來做燈？</p>
<p>答：在耶穌未降生之前的幾個世紀，中國人就已經用竹管到鹽礦中去裝了天然煤氣，回家做燈了。</p>
<p>問；是不是用來燙衣服的熨斗的烙鐵越重，燙起衣服來越平滑？</p>
<p>答：不是的，根據科學的硏究，一塊三四磅的烙鐵和一塊七八磅重的烙鐵是有着一樣的効力。那是鐵上的溫度和布上的濕度所起的効力。</p>
<p>問：是不是任何東西都可以變成透明，假使將那東西弄得極薄？</p>
<p>答：是的，一塊薄的鐵片，必須是十萬分之一的公分厚，也可以和玻璃一式一樣的透明。</p>
<p>問：假使沒有月亮，會不會仍舊有潮水？</p>
<p>答：會有的，假使沒有月亮，太陽會引起潮水的，事實上，在所有的潮水中，被太陽所引起的十一分之五。</p>

<p>回國後，張氏的政治生涯隨即開始，因當時中國美術界尙在消沉時期，發展不易，學非所川，原屬不得已。由廣東省農工廳秘書而中央組織部秘書，副部長，中央宣傳部長，而到目前的職位爲止，前後適二十年，其間會襄助陳立夫先生，推進黨務，甚爲得力。</p>
<p>張氏爲謙恭，誠懇，是一位富有修養的藝術工作者，據說張曾編著「自救」，「自誤」兩劇本，並徵求各界批評，有一靑年學生去函張氏，指述劇巾謬誤，結論說張氏不配談話劇，張　來書，認爲所論確有見地，深自慚愧，因在報端刊載廣吿，請該學生示明通訊處，以便請益。逾期一月，始獲復函，須張氏表示誠意，始允照辦。張氏依言作函表示，學生才吿以住所，要求僅作筆談，決不會晤，張氏爲尊重對方意見，陸續將著作劇本，郵寄該處，由該靑年學生一一簽註己見，仍交郵寄還，張氏採納頗多，後來探知對方係一貧困的苦學靑年，張氏便郵遞鉅款接濟，以表謝勉之意。</p>
<p>張氏不祗懂得粵語，並且精通　國語言，他的夫人也是一位法國小姐。張氏有一女，名麗運，今年十七歲，頗得張氏愛寵。</p>
<p>在從　政治生涯二十年間，張氏無時不關念着文化界的情况，並且不時保持接觸，百忙之中，更偸閒著述劇本文字。張氏富有感情，並且具有一般藝術工作者所欠缺的曠達的胸懷，在理，他是更宜於作一個藝術家的。</p>
<p>張先生今日的舉動，在政治的意義上說，當是一個損失；但在文化界方面看，該是一個可喜的收穫。</p>

<p>我會　遍中國的裨史野乘，筆記傳奇，尋尋覓覓，想找一個吻字，竟寥若晨星，，再査一査現代小說的詞句，雖有却也不多；不但如此，就讓你戴一個隱身帽，實際去調査中國男女的戀愛舉動，除掉夫妻們躲躱藏藏地偶然來一個輭懶的吻，或在下等社會裏淫夫蕩婦間有較大胆的演出外，其公開坦白的吻之表現，殊不多覯；就再拿「吻之庫」的電影來說，總該有一個實際表演的了，不料還僅是一個鏡頭的謊騙！極少的中國影片有吻的鏡頭，而這也是受外國影片影響的。</p>
<p>大　中國人總把孔老二的戒條，看做神聖的座右銘，發乎情還要止乎禮義，自古男女授受不親，手尙且掽不到，而况嘴乎？假若我們現在舉出一位半開明的少女，敎她自已去，不！是去看見，也不！是去聽說，有那麼一個悄人，在酒席塲中，在行人路邊，嘴兒對着嘴兒，嘖的一聲，哎唷！羞死了！羞死了！夾耳根子她就羞紅到頰顎邊了！</p>
<p>中國人的戀情，習慣在精神與心靈苦想的交流，就是在相逢之際，也若即若離，或迎或拒，其利用最多的形體是眼睛，其表現最多的姿態是微笑；（中國人祇有千金買笑，却沒有千金買吻。）一切一切，全是神的傳遞與靈的貫通；這一種高尙純潔的流路。不是西洋的粗綫條作風所得同日而語。</p>
<p>我們李後主的詞兒裏有一句：「爛嚼紅絨笑向檀郞吐」！僅要這一句，你瞧！這裏面的情趣，够你怎樣描繪？够你多少回味？其意韻，其膩緻，其靈活生動，是不是你們機械一般擁着抱着，千篇一律的吻着吻着，所能較其短長？</p>
<p>但在我們貴國的書籍裏，也未嘗找不到一個類似於吻的字，「妳讓我香一香」！這個香字，便是廣義的吻字，因爲我可香在妳的腮邊，香在妳的鬢邊，也可以香在妳的髮際眉梢，不過我們的香是男對女，不是女對男；（可憐並沒有一個美麗的女人自動來香我們臭男子的！）香啊！香啊！我忽然想到程瞻廬先生「唐祝文周四傑傳」裏兩個踱頭追求秋香的醜態，不禁使我縱聲狂笑。</p>

<p>— 許桂庭</p>
<p>魯遜第一次會見米恩時，行動非常古怪。在袋裘拿出一隻金質的香烟盒，對米恩說：「這是我從攝政街上的一間店舖裏偸來的。我忽然間喜歡這件東西，所以就把它倫來了。你不知道我會偸東西的嗎？」</p>
<p>米恩點點頭說：「哦，我知道的。你手上所持的手杖就是我這裏的「　撥灰的棍子。你無意中把它帶走了。」</p>
<p>「眞的嗎？」魯遜漲紅了臉，似　很尶尬地說，「我發誓，我家裏也有一條這樣的東西呢。」</p>
<p>算了罷。時間不早了我想知道關於你的一些事情。你的父母在世麽？　「他們都去世了。」　「請你再講詐細一些。」我的父親是律師。」魯遜於是停一會兒，閉着眼睛，然後恍惚地笑一笑再繼續說，「我的母親就是他的妻子。」</p>
<p>翌日，米恩把魯遜偸來的烟盒還給攝政街上的一間店舖。</p>
<p>下一次，魯遜又來了。米恩從藥櫃裏拿出一枝注射針來，裝滿了■水，對他說：「我想弄到你多講一點東西，所以爽爽快快替你注射這些藥水。注射之後，你就會覺得些微昏迷，但是不一定立刻睡　的。」</p>
<p>於是，米恩就替魯遜注射了。然後口裘數着一，二，三，四……直到七十的時候，魯遜開始糊塗起來。那心理分析家很鎮靜地催他講話，說：「喂！你講呀！最後一次，你正在駕駛着噴火機的時候，下面就是日本鬼子。那麽，怎探呢？」</p>
<p>魯遜聽了，忽然間高聲喊叫起來：「它着火了，我一定要鎭靜，鎭靜。我祇好用降落傘跳下來。我不知道我停留在樹巓上有多少時候。淸醒之後，就冒　極大的危險爬下來。不知怎樣，我失却知覺了。到再淸醒的時候，我睜開眼睛見到許多日本鬼子圍繞着我。我不知道他們怎樣會突然出現的。一個身軀魁梧的鬼子用槍柄向我的腰部猛擊一下，我就倒下去了。後來，他們拿了我的水壺，一滴水都不給我喝。他們還在那裏圍繞着我，獰笑不停。當時，我又昏過去了。</p>
<p>「醒來的時候，那個日本通譯向　我露齒而笑，然後給我一根香烟。他說，他曾經在倫敦住了五年。他對我那種　　的態度簡直令我難受。他老是　　我，詢問種　無關重要的問題，例如年紀多大，結了婚未等等。另外還有兩個鬼子後來問得不　煩了，一個用拳頭猛擊我的臉龐，另一個用槍柄打我的腰部。我慘叫了一聲，又倒下去了。這樣實在受不下去，我終於吿訴他們了。」</p>
<p>米恩立刻追問：「你吿訴他們什麽東西？」</p>
<p>魯遜把雙手捧着臉，全身在那裏發抖，呑呑吐吐地說：「我們的空軍部隊，駐紥　的地方，那裏調來的，我們的任務，我們的活動，一切的一切。」</p>
<p>他的聲音越來越高，節直變成尖銳聲的叫喊了。他結果昏倒了，把頭埋在沙發裏，痛哭起來。米恩連忙的安慰他，說：「不要緊，你喝點水　。」</p>
<p>一會兒，魯遜淸醒了，向周圍看一看，說：「我到底講了些什麽東西呀？」米　統統都吿訴他。他　了一口氣，吸一根香烟，再繼續叙述他的可怖的經過：</p>
<p>「後　那些日本鬼子覺得心滿意足了，還是他們還是不放鬆我，恐怕我會逃走。某一個早晨他們走進我的草棚來。其中一個拿着一根木棒，另一個用一塊木頭把我一條腿撑起來，然後向我的膝頭上猛擊了一下。天啊！我大呌了一聲，就完結了。（未完）</p>

<p>— 本報資料室</p>
<p>國民大會之展開，在今年一月政治協商會議中，決定於五月五日在南京舉行。中央　手籌備，特派邵力子爲國大　委會主任委員。至四月中，籌備業已就緒，國府下令召集，並定自四月廿五日起，各地國大代表開始報到。蔣主席於四月十五日曾邀請政協綜合小組茶　，請各黨派在四月二十日以前提出國大代表名單，惟至四月廿四日，各黨派的代表名單，仍未提出，而中共代表國復聲明對此事不能考慮。蔣主席於廿四日下午四時，在國民政府再度邀請政協綜合小組各黨派代表及社會賢達茶會，商討國大問題及其他有關　項，結果爲顧全事實，尊重各黨派意見，決定將會期暫行展緩，同時盼各方對協商工作，加速進行，以期國民大會早日舉行。</p>
<p>延期命令發表後，已抵京之國大代表第一批一百三十人首先表示反對，致電重慶，主張中共及民盟縱不提出代表，國大亦應如期舉行。嗣後各地國大代表絡繹來京，一致力爭國大不應延期，並在五月一日自行召開國大準備會議，到代表二百餘人，由桂省代表林虎任臨時主席，共同表示國大即使延期，亦應有一定限度。五月六日政府代表邵力子在中央大禮堂茶會招待國大代表，詳述政府苦衷，向代表剴切勸導，共體時艱，代表們羣起責難。至五月十三日，國大籌備會始休會接受蔣主席勸吿，成立幹事會研究憲草</p>
<p>國大延期了，但召開的時期在當時並未決定，以致各方揣測紛紜，有謂在六月初，有謂在秋凉後，莫衷一是。直至七月三日，在國防最高委員會會議中，蔣主席提出召開國大問題，徵求意見，大多數認爲不能再事拖延，必須定期舉行，否則將無以取信於人民，於是決定國民大會在十一月十二日舉行，其召開辦法，決依照政協會議的決議進行，如屆時有一部份黨派代表不參加，國大仍如期舉行，決不再有變更。</p>
<p>國大定期召開命令發表後，中共聲稱事先毫無所知，對此項決定不受任何的束。但政府本還政於民的一貫方針，竭力在國大召開期前，屢决舉行和平談判，以期獲得協議。一方面國大籌備工作，重新恢復進行。國大選舉事務所在九月廿四日正式發出催促各黨派提出名單的通知，由張厲生具名，請各黨派在十月初旬提出名單，政府決定於十月二日，頒布國大召集令。</p>
<p>九月二十八日，蔣生席召見國大籌備會秘書長洪蘭友垂詢國大籌備工作進行情形。同日，中共代表團正式函覆國大籌備會，拒絕提出代表名單，據中共函中稱：「目前尙無憲法可供國大討論，因此未便參加。」民盟亦與中共採取同一能度，九月三十日張　，沈鈞儒等九人致書蔣主席，認爲必須全國恢復和平以後，方能召開國大。</p>
<p>政府爲斟酌盡　起見，原來預定在十月二日頒布之召集令未予頒發，至十一日始由國府文官處正式頒布，同時送達各代表，通知如期集會，定十一月二日前報到。召集令下後，南京籌備工作頓呈緊張，會塲佈置，日夜趕工，各項招待辦法，亦經確定。籌備處爲應付南京房荒起見，特設招待所六處。全國交通綫也都協助工作，給予代表們以交通上的便利。</p>
<p>同時，首都和平談判，雙方均以國大名單及停戰兩項爲主題。政府方面爲求憲政之早日實現，催促各黨派如期提出代表的名單。</p>
<p>各地代表自二日起在南京新街口社會服務處報到，頗見踴躍。而中共及各黨派名單，仍未提出，政府當局，爲促使和平統一，還政於民起見，不惜作最大之容讓，故於本月八日，蔣主席毅然宣佈，明令關內外國軍，停將日漸長成！謹祝國大進行順利，民族前途無疆！</p>

<h3 id="c179">國大代表　招待所印象 <a href="#c179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>— 本報特派記者</p>
<p>國大代表招待所分設五處，最漂亮的當然是第二招待所！也就是原來的華僑招待所。畫棟雕樑，粉刷一新，紅的格外顯得紅，綠的格外顯得綠，鮮艷奪目，有一點北平的氣息。在田野氣太重的南京，這座建築是添了些鮮艷的筆觸的。</p>
<p>一進門，有專供代表們買零碎日用品的玻璃櫃台，分列左右兩行。左面一排盡是「美式配備」，牙膏牙刷最多，其次就是香烟雪茄巧格力糖之類，也有上海配給過公敎人員的食盒。你一看見就想起上海的那些聯合商塲，唯一的不同也許祇是此地東西的價錢比上海要貴上兩三成。右面一排櫃合却全是國貨了，東西的品類就少，無非是些襪子毛巾，不過櫃上一塊小牌子倒甚有意思，說這些全是國貨，優待代表們，還可以照定價打一個九折。我以爲這位老板很聰明，因爲住在這招待所的代表們不少都是華僑，在外國和洋商都是競爭過來的，愛用國貨的心理當然格外强。不過，這兩排櫃子上的生意都淸淡得很。</p>
<p>每一個招待所都有一點爲代表們謀便利的臨時設備，如臨時郵局，電報長途電話，儲滙，還有接受代表們委託辦理各項事務的——從定旅館房間起一直到預定戲票爲止。據招待所的職員們說，這一部份工作是最繁忙的。我也許可以提一提這兒送信的一個極　好的辦法，上海以後大可仿行。這就是，臨時郵局辦了一種機器脚踏車送信的制度，寄信人無須貼郵票，郵局每天分幾班呌郵差乘坐機器脚踏車分送全市，郵費是一總照重量多寡，由招待所撥付的。</p>
<p>不過，如果你要去拜訪一位代表却不大容易，因爲樓梯上每一個轉角都有武裝齊備的憲兵，滿面冰霜之氣，呌你望而却步。你拿出名片來也沒有用，非得到下面去找了辦事處的職員一同上去不可。而職員帶你上去的時候，那位憲兵就見你上去也敬禮，下來也敬禮了。胡適之傅孟眞都是國大代表，如果呌他們住在這種地方，不知他們又作何感想？</p>
<p>每位代表由大會奉送毛巾兩條，但牙刷牙膏却沒有。大會供給白磁面盆，供給擦皮鞋。</p>
<p>代表們的房間宛如學生宿舍，每一個房間裏要住上五六個人，可供迴旋之地自然就不多了。旅館裏也住　大概二百左右代表，房間都是招待所代訂的，如果住着中央飯店之類，當然就稍爲舒服一點——因之招待所的職員就一天到晚打電話到各旅館要房間。目前住在各招待所的代表，總數大的六七百人的樣子。</p>
<p>紅紙廊中央政治大學是第一招待所，馬路旣狹窄又不平，坐在汽車裏顚得很難受。不過大多數的代表倒都住在此地。因爲華僑招待所是規定只招待華僑代表和兩廣的區域代表的。</p>
<p>招待所的負責人朱品三先生說，等到各黨各派代表來的時候，我們還有房子，馬上就可以再成立幾個招待所。</p>
<p>各代表以同鄕住同室爲原則。上海代表住在招待所的不多。在一間很小的房間裏，我曾見過有四五位頗爲發福的代表，一式天靑緞袍黑馬掛，穿套褲，剃光頭，八字鬍鬚，雍容揖讓，可見一定是從什麼禮義之鄕來的。</p>
<p>韓國華僑祗有一名代表，他就獨住一間屋子。這位老先生是周慎九先生，原籍山東，在韓國居住三四十年了。談起以前日本人對華僑的壓迫，不勝感慨，但是現在的情形也似乎還離理想有些距離。最令人注意的一句是：日本人還在處心積慮的影響當地當局，而且是不擇手段的幹。韓南現在是美軍防區，秩序比較上還好，但華僑還處於一種無人　問的狀態——代表團留在華北不進，總領事也尙未動身。</p>
<p>代表們在白天是出門觀光首都的時候較多，全南京市都有國大代表足跡，餐館酒樓貼着「國大代表特約餐廳」的很多。若援「勝利快餐」，「新運飯」之例，很應該有「國大代表飯」。其實代表們在招待所吃的客飯，也許就可算是「國大代表飯」了，如果是一個人吃，可吃一炒菜，一冷菜，一湯，不過盛菜的盆大槪口徑決不超過五寸。據飯堂老板的意思，生意要算很不壞，以後生意也許還會好起來。</p>
<p>你要問我對國大招待所的印象麽？很簡單：職員極忙；代表極閒。（十三日）</p>

<p>— 本報特派記者</p>
<p>國民大會的產生，是中國民主政治的先聲，今後民主政制的保障，是在於憲法的確訂，因此，很久以前，已有很多人在熱心地商討憲草的問題，立法院這幾天正在如何修正或補充五五憲法的問題，激辯正烈，一方面蔣主席明令立法院限期提出憲草，所以如何修改或補充五五憲草的問題，不但是在政諸公討論中心，而且也爲全國同胞所熱心關注的。因此，記者特走訪五五憲法草案的原起草人樓桐蓀先生，徵詢關於修正或補充憲草的意見。樓先生以學者的沉靜態度，在他的書房裏接見記者，坦白地陳述他個人對於憲草修正的意見。</p>
<p>他說：五五憲草，自宣布迄今，已閱十年，誠然因事過境遷，難免有若干需要重加調整之處。尤其關於省的一節（第五章第一節）不但條文簡單，（共祗五條，）而且省的地位和性質，實均不甚明確，在擬訂條文時的政治情勢，與現在的情勢比較起來，顯然已有重大的變遷，爲求適應現勢，實行國父的均權制度的遺敎，不能不有相當的修正或補充。這在我們原起草人，亦是可以坦白承認的。其他如司法，考試兩院院長的產生，國民經濟章條文的蕪雜，尤其是章末第一二九，第一三〇兩條，事實上可說早已失去了作用，以及第八章第一四三條關於立法委員監察委員產生方法之過渡條款，亦已不應存在等，當然均待修改，但最重要的是五五憲草的基本原理與原則，都是恪遵國父遺敎，經過立法院起草委員會長時期多數人的仔細硏討，並曾公開徽詢全國人民的意見而加以決定，始由國府宣布的。例如國民大會的組織和職權，要使它確實成爲人民在中央行使政權的機關，總統與行政院長無論事實上爲一人兼任，抑爲兩人分任，但在五權應法的原理上，都只能是行使一種權力——行政權，（所以第五十六條規定行政院院長由總統任免。）行政，立法，司法，考試，監察，五院，雖然機關的形式（設院或不設院）可以不拘，但必須是分行五權，是毫無置疑餘地的，近年少數時賢，對於大總統的職權及行政院與立法院的關係上，發表了很多的意見，並提出了修正的草案，主要目的無非是要使總統權縮小，甚至毫無權力，大體上等於法國的大總統，而要行政院對立法院負責，使立法院大體上等於一般國家國會的下院（衆議院），監察院成爲美國式的參議院，總之一句話，……千變萬化，都不外是因襲英，美，法等國的議會政治，而以內閣制爲設計的中心思想。老實說這與國父　教的精神是相去很遠的。我們目前關於憲法草案的問題，困難焦點即在於此。</p>
<p>樓先生是個學者，是個五五憲草的原起草人，是個歷睹中國政治情勢變遷的政治人物，他底坦白誠懇的意見，是足使熱心商討憲草的時賢和密切關注憲草的同胞重視的。</p>
<h3 id="c181">冠蓋京華 <a href="#c181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>— 本報特約記者</p>
<p>國大代表現已紛紛來京報到準備開會，總數已達到一千三百六十餘名的數目，在二千零五十名總額中已佔到半數以上的多數，他們都是來自不同的區域，代表不同的職業甚或在各代表私人方面，各有各的宗敎信仰以及生活嗜好，但有一點是共同的，就是他們都是能孚衆望，能代表國民說話的人物。這幾天首都各處都可看到這些代表先生們掛着鮮明的代表證章漫步街頭，或遨遊名勝，眞可謂「冠蓋京華」，極一時之盛！他們到京後，在生活上幾無處不享受便利，優待連許多大商店也自動的貼出了「歡迎國大代表，×折優待」的標幟，願意薄利爲代表服務。現在就讓筆者一述代表們坐活的而面觀吧！</p>
<p>代表們到京時，一踏下交通工具，一定首先就會考慮到住宿問題，「京居不易」，這是誰都知道的事，據說：國大假若在戰前召開的話，代表先生們至少有半數是住在自己在京的私人房屋內，或住在南京的親友家，不過現在却不同了，絕大多數是住在國大籌委會所準備的招待所裏，招待所一共準備了五處，第一招待所設在中央政校內，可容五百餘人，爲了招待國大代表，政校的同學不得不分發各機關實習，第二招待所在華僑招待所，最爲富麗堂皇，寄住的多爲海外華僑代表，第三招待所在成賢街，是由國大籌委會臨時組下的，第四招待所在女靑年會，這裏可說是留給女代表們專住的，還有一個第五招待所係借地政硏究所爲所址，容納人數有限，總共這五個招待所，一共也只能容住代表一千餘人，不足之數，籌委會已向本市各大旅館租定房間，作爲補充。各招待所內設有侍應生，事務員，衛生處，委託代辦處，郵局，銀行，電信局，書報閱覽室，文具雜誌供應部，洗衣，縫紉及日用品供應部，就連代表們要搽皮鞋，也有擦鞋部來服務，至於不住宿舍的代表們，還可領到十五萬元的宿費。</p>
<p>代表先生們到京後膳食方面，也極方便，自代表報到京之日起至大會閉幕後五日止，均由籌委會供應。惟因代表們有不同的省籍及不同宗敎的信仰，所以籌委會準備膳食也極爲不便，現在該會已與首都四十八家大餐廳約定，代表憑餐券可隨意前往用膳，這四十八家餐館，代表京·粵·川·淸眞·平津·蘇滬·浙·皖·豫·湘·閩·素食·西菜各種口味。其中有一家就是夫子廟的「六華春」京菜館，這是去　蔣夫人前往用過餐的，所以在首都只要提到「六華春」三字，未有不知道它這一段光榮歷史的，現在蒙藏代表到京的，據說吃不慣這幾個特約餐館的菜飯已自理伙食了</p>
<p>代表們因爲分居各處，除有私人小汽車者可自由活動外，其餘的代表舉凡到會，散會用餐不得不利用「國民大會專車」了，這些大型的專車，一共有六十輛，均漆成鮮　的顏色，只要憑代表們所佩證章，就可自由乘用，經常還有五路交通車各處設站，駛行全市，幾乎從淸早七點半鐘起至晚上九點半鐘止，不停的輪流行駛，乘搭甚便。國大籌委會並己與上海祥生公司訂的，迅速運京廿輛小吉普車分停各代表招待所附近减費爲代表服務。如此，倘若代表先生個人有什麼活動的話，也可不必一定要搭乘大專車了。</p>
<p>最後筆者不能不順便提一提這次國大籌委會的工作人員。他們工作的最高原則是：「一切爲了代表」·他們工作的範圍是：「無所不包』，　要能使代表先生們舒適便利的事，都　屬於他們籌備的責任。截至目前的繞計，現在國大專任調用的工作人員，一共達到一千餘人，他們生平旣未經歷這樣大的塲面，我國也從未召開幾千人的大集會，使現在的工作人員有例可循，因之一切籌備，只有憑想象去辦，一俟事實上發現有不便時，再來修改，這在辦事的精神上是　得欽佩的，但不久國大開幕後，是否遵會發生許多缺陷，那就要以將來的事實來實騐了。（信）</p>

<h3 id="c182">國大是怎樣籌備的 <a href="#c182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>— 本報特派記者</p>
<p>國民大會的籌備，我們從廿五年起計算已是十年了，隨着六次的延期，籌備的工作，一次比一次緊張，籌備的範圍，一天比一天龐大，這一次的籌備工作，五五的那一次，已是奠定了初基，因爲延期，有了六個月的準備，自然美滿週到，我們看：會業是那樣的雄壯巍峨，招待是那樣舒適便利，動作是那麼敏捷迅速，塲面是那樣的壯嚴偉大，科學頭腦的運用，這裏充分表現中華民國的偉大！</p>
<p>大會籌備的分工，是根據需要有條不紊的，秘書處是大會籌備的主腦部門，這裏他分成文書，新聞，佈置，總務，人事，會議六組，工作最忙碌的要算總務，佈置，新聞三組，招待處是大會籌備的勤務，依據他的需要設置交通聯絡，住宿，食膳，登記五組這些都是實際的工作，代表來報到，要設法交通工具，代表報到後，要爲他們解決食宿，這是最麻煩最忙碌了，比較簡單的是大會警衛工作，國大要開幕了，堂皇的國大籌備工作，國人正矚目以待，這裏記者特予详細的報導：</p>
<p>先從大會的佈置工作說起：國民大會堂過去是一個戲院，廿五年時把他改造而成的，前樓是三層建築，都是鋼骨水泥，顯得堅固也顯得光滑，會堂是戲院一樣的，後半部有樓廳，塲地不見得寬闊，下面僅能設座一千五百個，上面是層疊式的裝置，愈遠的愈高，一共是一千個位置，從坐位去看主席台，勉強上過得去，如果代表們要看代表們的動作，上下隔膜，那是如坐五里霧中，這裏不能責備籌備工作人員，光天的不足，那是無法解決的，巍峨的國民大會堂，高聳在國府路上，金刊的「國民大會堂」五字還是林故主席的手筆，今天煥然一新了，總理　墨「天下爲公」四字，橫排在大會的門首，祇要你一踏上大會堂的右級，就會使你體會到國民大會的最後目標，「以建民國」「以進大同」，刊在會堂的兩旁，這裏吿訴每一個代表赴會的指路牌，紫紅色的坐椅，反映顏色不同的電光，自然是「一登龍門，身價十倍」了，主席台上裝置整潔，素黃的綢布，陪襯台上的雅緻，總理在上面笑了，配上嘉禾銀花更是「八面玲瓏五光十色」，蔣主席玉照，掛在總理遺像的對面，使人敬仰，使人愛戴，今天大會開幕了，總理爲中華民國開基蔣主席繼總理完成建國，同時是人民的救星，其功業彪炳宇宙，當然是値得萬民歡呼的！</p>
<p>其次談到大會的招待，她是分別設置的，第一招待所設中政校，這裏可容五百人，第二招待所設中山北路（華僑招待所）可容三百人，第三招待所設成賢街，可容八十人，第四招待所設地政研究院，可容一百人，第五招待所設女靑年會，可容五十人（專招待女代表）內部的設備，比上次好多了，有新的被褥，有新的床舖，有新的桌子，享受個個一棵，代表的交通工具，完全是很漂亮的大包車，一共是三十部分成五路行駛，另外有吉普車二十輛專爲大會聯絡及警備之用，停車塲也是採用科學佈置與科學管理的，各有各的位置，地段上是標名的。食的問題，如果不願意領餐券，那發你二十四萬元，領到餐券的，任你吃中西菜，大會特的六十幾家餐　供應的。</p>
<p>郵電的機構，也是籌備工作重要的一部門，南京電信局特地在這裏設置臨時營業處，專爲代表及新聞記者收發電報之用，採用最新式自動打字機，一小時內可到香港，上海的電報要不到四十分鐘，工作人員一共是二十個，十個留在大會堂裏面，設有專綫二十對，隨時可以傳播，電話裝有一百門，　開關　有三個接綫生，當然是可供應州的。</p>
<p>新聞記者是播送大會消息的傳聲筒。辦理記者登記的新聞組，那是大忙特忙了，全國各地的報紙聲請的達二百餘家，另外海外各地，以及全世界的新聞記者，都重視它道有歷史意議的集會，也特地來聲請了，新聞組的法寳，第一步要中宣部證明，第二步視情形的需要，雖然有幾十家沒有核准，但大多數已是發了入塲證，這裏二百卅幾位記者，一小部份是坐包廂，一小部份分座棋上樓下，在會塲內，在會塲外，都是他們的活動塲所，新聞充分自由，會議充分民主，中華民國的新生，自然是燦爛光明，前程偉大的。憲法是國家的根本，這次代表的任務是制憲，我們寄語代表先生：我們需要一部完善的憲法，我們需要一部建國的憲法！我們正在這樣期待着！</p>
<h3 id="c183">胡適之也到了南京 <a href="#c183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>— 本報特派記者</p>
<p>照胡適之先生的說法，新聞記者大槪是專門管別人家的閒事的。他說，「我們幾個人前天飛到南京大校場，一看新聞記者一個也沒有，眞是喜出望外！大家述着就趕到報到處去報到，不想在國大報到處竟也是一個新聞記者都沒有！後來才知道，原來那天你們在忙着自己的事——跟新聞組辦入塲證是不是；」</p>
<p>你瞧，找他罷，他嫌麻煩；，不找罷，又彷彿我們新聞記者失禮了似的。我就暗地　下了一個決心：跟胡先生「蔴菇上」那麼三個鐘頭再說！</p>
<p>胡先生穿着長袍，很暇豫的樣子。他說，國大放了他三天假，頗有抽空一讀珍本水經注之意。他客氣地拿出了一包拆封未久的馬立斯出來敬客。我們也客氣了一下，說是不抽烟。胡先生大爲驚寄，說，「新聞記者有不抽烟的嗎；倒是難得了！」</p>
<p>其實，我們每個人的口袋裏都有烟。</p>
<p>胡先生舒適地倚在沙法上，烟圈一縷一縷在靜靜的房間裏消失，悠閒地談起北大來。北大在十一月四日剛正式上課，醫學院因爲沒有內地復員的舊生，早就上課了。這次招考新生，因爲發表得稍遲，所以報到的限期也遲了一點，不過現在算起來也迫近了，就在十五號。」</p>
<p>在敬熙先生星期日在報上　表了一篇以「自費留學萬萬不可關放」爲題的文章。今天，又有人在討論這個問題了，我想這個考題是胡先生不能不交卷的，就輕輕地提了出來。</p>
<p>胡先生說他沒有看見那篇文章，不曉得汪先生是怎樣說的。不過就自費留學這件事，倒的確是有點意見可說。</p>
<p>他說，在抗戰期間，自費留學可以請結外匯，一塊美金祇合法幣二十元，當然就覺得外國的生活費用要比中國低得多。而且，公費留學生每年祇能請領美金一千八百元，而自費生却能够每年申請二千四百元，還有二千元旅費，一共有四千四百元之多。於是就大家自費留學，過的生活相常奢侈，學堂倒不一定進去，主要的倒是逃避兵役。胡先生說，德國投降的時候，他在美國，那時就看見過自費生帶了一家老小一同去的。而且，德國投降之後，汽油也比較鬆了，那些自費生中就有買了汽車，買些黑市汽油，在美國大玩的。這種情形自然不好。</p>
<p>但是，胡先生說，他平常的主張是自費留學應以不必經過考試爲原則。要考則必須考得嚴。爲甚麼呢？因爲公費留學考試的資格限制很嚴，一定要大學畢業，還要是工作過兩年的，所以錄取的學生就大多是三十多歲的人。一個人到了三十多歲，學語言的能力就差了。</p>
<p>胡先生的談風健起來了，我　　是靜靜傾聽。很想抽烟，可是　不好意思抽烟了。如果不是當　的送進了一張名片，胡先生的談話也許就不會打斷。客人進來了，是鬚眉皆白，精神奕奕的東北大學校長减啓芳先生。</p>
<p>胡先生對臧先生說，「他們是新聞記者。不過不和我談政治，所以我倒很高興。」臧老先生哈哈大笑，說，「對啊，政治怎麼能談呢！」</p>
<p>於是就繼續談留學，减先生倒也很發生興趣。</p>
<p>胡先生說，「語言是求知識最要緊的工具。三十多歲的公費生出國之後，學科方面倒是够的，他就認識了兩三位敎授，五六個同　的同學，忙忙碌碌，到後來寫一　論文。社會上天大的事他都不管。別人家什麼社會制度啊，大選小選啊，他全不理會。他忙的是做論文，謀一個博士碩士的學位。其實，叫他們出去的本意倒並不在於他們的學位，」</p>
<p>臧先生完全表示同意，他說看看人家的社會制度就比專門想學位要有意議得多。</p>
<p>這時候，胡先生談到了自費留學的正面了。他主張自費留學生的年齡要小。他要呌二十歲左右的靑年出去，讓他們好好多學幾年。因爲，二十左右的學生出國，那麽語言就學得好，而且對外國的文化，政治，社會，也一定發生很大的興趣。將來回國之後，所發生的作用就不間了。所以，如果家中有可以造就的年少子女，不妨讓他們在國內大學裏先讀一兩年；再到外國大學本科夾去做插班生。過了二十五歲的人，實在就已不宜再學語言，而硏究社會學，文史，也必須要出去得早。</p>
<p>公費考試限制得嚴，年齡小的人要考就不容易，所以就不如把自費放鬆—不過，常然流弊也一定很多。胡先生說，如果一定要考，則一定要嚴，至少可以得到好的學生。</p>
<p>臧先生說，留學生在外國沒有人管也不大好，是不是該派人監督監督呢？</p>
<p>胡先生說，「留學生監督嗎？不好不好。地方大，要管也管不住的。你看美國東西三千哩，大學有七百多所，這怎探管他們呢？美國的大學又不是政府的管埋，學生們從這校轉到那校，他玩他的，這有什麼辦法？再說，設置留學生監督還有干涉思想之嫌，你在管他讀書不用功，外國人倒疑心到別的地方去了，實在不妥當。」</p>
<p>胡先生想了一想，說『我在三十年前寫過一篇文章，題目呌做一非留學談』談，這篇文章後來沒有收入「文存」。主要的意思是說國內賠當多辦大學，而且要　　好，要程度能够使國內的學生滿怠—那就不必再留學了。民國二十五六年間，是國內大學辦得最發達的時候，可以和國外大學相比的，至少在十個以上。戰爭中雖受損失，祇要國內安定，相信祇要兩三年—至多四年，一定能够恢復。不但是本科，就是辦硏究院的，也可以不成問題。」</p>
<p>一位胖胖的先生推門而入，戴一副小小眼鏡，口含大烟斗，足着拖鞋，頭髮蓬鬆得像是一個匆匆用石膏塑成的小金字塔—常然是傅斯年先生。胡先生笑着請他進來大家談談，可是傳先生運「他們是新聞記老」那句話都沒有聽完，急急忙忙溜之乎也！</p>
<p>我笑　問胡先生，可口不可以談「一點點」政治，對於憲草修正案的看法怎麼樣？我明知此問一出，一定會僵，不過反正已經到了該走的時候，姑且試試而已。我當然沒有忘記胡先生同時還是外交家。胡先生笑着走過來說：「這就是煨難談的了。我不是在四個月之前就說過，我這次回來了要做小學生嗎？做學生就該有敎科書，總以爲國大籌備處一定會供給我們一些參考材料的——可是完全沒有，我簡直一點也不知道。」</p>
<p>我那時就想了一想這篇訪問記的題目該怎麽寫：「訪國大代表胡適」似乎沒有現在這個題目好，於是欣然走出了歷史硏究所裏那間很溫暖的房問。（十四日</p>

<h3 id="c185">國民大會　婦女代表的熱情 <a href="#c185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>— 本報特派記者</p>
<p>國大婦女代表在二〇五〇名的總數目裏，佔了一個零頭的數目，雖然女同胞是中華全國同胞的半數，但是誠如國大　委會秘書長洪蘭友在一次記者招待會所說：「別人家已是行憲很久的國家了，我們却剛才制憲，自然的要落在人後」，這種必然的落後情形，也就很自然的在這裏表現，現在不必說明當這些名單未公佈前是有着多少女同胞曾經力竭聲嘶，奔走呼號，想爭取婦女同胞參加國民大會名額，多少婦女同胞被人恥笑爲只知爭取權利。現在名單業已公佈，站在婦女的立塲說，我們還是可以於心稍安，因爲無論是國府明令之婦女代表或直接遴選的婦女代表，或區域的婦女代表，她們都是稱得上做婦女同胞的代表的。效們每個人都是拿自己過去或現在所表現的才能所換取到的。</p>
<p>我們有這樣一種感覺，婦女對事，總比較特，別來得熱情，就代表報到的情形來說，她們都是儘早的趕來辦理手續，同時寄予大會的希望也特別熱切。你如果遍訪每一位女代表，問問她們對國是的意見和對國大的希望，她們一定每個人都會對你說，我們希望大家開誠布公，平心靜氣的杷問題解決，使國民大會得以在和平統一團結的空氣裏舉行。</p>
<p>婦女代表每一個人都有着自己的事業，無論在敎育或科學以及其他爲國家效力的各種部門。這次代表們自各地來京集會，一面觀光首都拜　舊雨，同時也舉行了好幾次的茶會，分別把各個地區的婦女生活狀態及地域稱濟和她們的事業介紹給了大家，因此頗能收到交換意見互相砥　的實效。</p>
<p>代表中，一部份是原在南京的，比如蔣宋美齡，劉蘅靜，陳逸雲，莊靜，唐國楨，　貽芳，沈慧蓮，呂雲章等，她們都是中央歸女運動委員會的委員和婦女指道委員會的理事長，理監事，她們隨時和廣大的婦女羣接觸，同時也服務於廣大的婦女羣，她們知道婦女同胞的疾苦，她們實地爲婦女同胞解除痛苦，所以她們是眞正能代表婦女羣衆的意見，足以做婦女的代表的。</p>
<p>還有各地來的婦女代表，鳥靜彬，鄧梅珠娜，陶寄天，張邦珍，馮雲仙，羅衡等也都是在各該地新疆西康雲南各地有着很卓越的事業成就的。她們成天夾了一個大皮包街上匆匆的來去，你要知道她們過人的才幹，出人頭地的氣概，只要注意她們在今後大會上各種活躍的恣態。（十三日。）</p>

<h3 id="e1">National Assembly Opens This Morning; Chairman Chiang Will Attend and Deliver a Speech; Wu Chih-hui to Serve as Temporary Chairman of the Assembly <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 14th] The National Assembly is scheduled to hold its opening ceremony at 10:00 AM on the 15th. The program is as follows: (1) Ceremony begins. (2) All rise.

(7) The Chairman respectfully reads the Founding Father's will. (8) Representatives take an oath. (9) The Chairman delivers the opening address.

The oath for the representatives is recorded as follows: "XXX, with the utmost sincerity, representing the people of the Republic of China, accept the teachings of Mr. Sun, the founder of the Republic of China, exercise my powers according to the law, and abide by the discipline of the National Assembly. I solemnly swear." After taking the oath, the representatives will also sign the oath.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 14th] It has been confirmed that the National Assembly will open on the 15th with the opening ceremony to be held at 10:00 AM. Party elder Wu Chih-hui will serve as the temporary chairman, and Chairman Chiang will personally attend and deliver instructions. There will be no activities in the afternoon. A preparatory meeting will be held on the 16th. On the eve of the opening of the National Assembly Preparatory Office, hundreds of staff members worked until midnight. Hong Lan-you has fallen ill as a result. The registration office also remained open late into the night to await the arrival of people from various parties and factions to register.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 14th] Chairman Chiang, accompanied by his wife, visited the Ministry of National Defense at 4:00 PM on the 14th to attend the tea party hosted by the Central Party Headquarters for the representatives attending the National Assembly. Chairman Chiang, in his capacity as Director-General of the Kuomintang, delivered a speech recounting the revolutionary history of the party over the past fifty years, especially the twenty years since the Northern Expedition. He encouraged all comrades attending the National Assembly to accomplish the important task of the Kuomintang returning power to the people, to formulate a fundamental law for the country, and to unite and struggle together to grasp the current environment in order to fully realize the Three Principles of the People and gradually complete the Five-Power Constitution. During Chairman Chiang's speech, the entire audience listened solemnly and quietly for an hour and a half before dispersing with enthusiastic applause.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 14th] The National Assembly Preparatory Committee, with the opening of the National Assembly imminent and its mission coming to an end, convened a committee meeting at 9:00 AM on the 14th in the National Assembly Hall. Committee members Wu Dingchang, Zhang Lisheng, Lei Zhen, Chen Lifu, and Secretary-General Hong Lan-you, among others, attended. Wu Dingchang acted as chairman. During the meeting, in addition to reviewing the reports submitted by various departments of the Preparatory Committee, discussions were held on how to transfer all of the Preparatory Committee's work to the Assembly, based on the provisions of the Preparatory Committee's organizational regulations, which stipulate that the Preparatory Committee's mission ends when the National Assembly opens. It was decided that the General Assembly Secretariat and the Preparatory Committee would consult on a handover date when the General Assembly Secretariat was established.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 14th] On the eve of the opening of the National Assembly, telegrams expressing support and congratulating the Assembly on its success poured in from all directions. On the 14th, telegrams arrived in Beijing like snowflakes, sent by people's organizations and public opinion institutions in Fujian, Jiangsu, Hubei, Qingdao, Hong Kong, Beiping, Shanghai, and other places.</p>
<h3 id="e2">Youth Party Decides to Attend; Social Elites Have Registered <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 14th] The Chinese Youth Party has decided to participate in the National Assembly with a quota of 100 representatives. The list of names will be submitted after the Assembly opens, and registrations will be made successively.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 14th] Those who registered today include Zhang Fakui, Wang Yunwu, Wu Shuming, Wu Jingxiong, Zhang Aizhen, Wu Yifang, and social elites Miao Jiaming, Hu Lin, Li Zhuchen, and Mo Dehui, as well as border representatives Sonam Zaxi Suohdeli and others, totaling 46 people, for a grand total of 1,420 people. Although the National Assembly opens on the 15th, people from various parties and factions and those who have not yet arrived due to transportation issues may still register at any time.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 14th] The National Government issued an order on the 14th stating that the names of the National Assembly representatives who have been deregistered due to various reasons will be replaced by alternates. The list of replacements is published as follows: This order. Wang Kunlun, a directly elected representative of the National Government (unable to attend due to illness), has been deregistered and replaced by Wu Jingxiong. Pan Wenhua, a representative of the military (unable to attend due to defense duties), has been deregistered and replaced by Wang Shuming.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] As of the 14th, the number of news reporters registered to attend the National Assembly as observers has been largely finalized. There are 222 units from Chinese and foreign news agencies, including 43 foreign reporters and 264 domestic reporters, totaling 307 people, breaking the record for the number of news reporters attending domestic gatherings.</p>
<h3 id="e3">Those Participating in the Consultations Claim: Government Will Be Reorganized Soon; Appealing for Peace, the Utmost Tolerance Has Been Shown <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] A reporter visited individuals who recently came to Shanghai from Beijing and participated in consultations, asking for their views on the current situation. They stated that the government authorities have shown the utmost tolerance for the unresolved situation. After the announcement of the National Assembly opening summons on the 12th, all procedures were completed, and invitations were sent to the envoys of various countries to attend. However, due to the desire to wait for various parties and factions to submit their lists and attend the assembly, it was postponed for another three days, demonstrating their tolerance.</p>
<p>The goals that the government authorities, various parties and factions, and people across the country hope to achieve are originally consistent, which is nothing more than seeking peace, unity, and democracy. However, how to achieve peace, unity, and democracy must go through a certain path, and there is no other way to take this path except to unanimously participate in the National Assembly. Negotiations that do not use the National Assembly as a medium will be even more difficult to carry out. The government has already expressed its utmost sincerity. If the Communist Party insists on not participating in the overall situation, it will be close to being autocratic and will not be tolerated by the public. It is highly possible that the Third Force will participate in the National Assembly. According to reliable sources, all parties and factions, except for a small faction within the Democratic League that is close to the Chinese Communist Party, will submit their lists within a few days. Among the social elites, except for Guo Moruo, who does not intend to participate due to an ear ailment, the rest are considering registering. If that is the case, the Communist Party's non-participation will not affect the National Assembly.</p>
<p>According to their observation, the government will inevitably be reorganized, and the deadline for its reorganization should not exceed one week. The National Assembly will postpone its opening for a day or two after this opening, and its recess period will have a significant impact on the government's reorganization, and the reorganization of the Executive Yuan is also inevitable. The Supreme National Defense Council may be abolished after the government is reorganized.</p>

<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 14th] Bai Chongxi hosted a banquet for the Xinjiang representatives of the National Assembly at the Minister's Office of the Ministry of National Defense at 6:00 PM on the 14th, with more than fifty people attending. Newsreels were also screened at 7:00 PM to add to the enjoyment.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, This City] Ge Jingen, Secretary-General of the Taiwan Provincial Administrative Office, flew from Taiwan to Shanghai at 2:00 PM on the 14th and took the night express train to Beijing on the same day to register and attend the National Assembly meeting. It is reported that Ge will need to come to Shanghai again next week, delay briefly, and then go to Beijing again to continue attending the meeting.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] Ma Shouchang, Cheng Gong, Ren Faxiu, Han Shumiao, Suohdeli, Sonam Zaxi, Li Zengyin, Li Fu Can, Li Wenming, and Feng Hong, representatives from Qingdao and Xikang who arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday, took the train to Beijing to register at 7:00 AM yesterday morning.</p>

<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Gu Yuxiu, Director of the Municipal Education Bureau, returned from Europe and the United States a few days ago. It is said that he returned early this time to attend the National Assembly, so he rushed to Nanjing to register before the 12th. Later, due to the postponement of the National Assembly, he returned to Shanghai. On the morning of the 14th, Mr. Gu went to the Education Bureau to work, and then went to Beijing again that night to attend the meeting.</p>

<h3 id="e7">Legislative Yuan Opens Discussion Meeting Today; Discussing the Legislative Procedures for the Draft Constitution <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>The Jing Central Daily Advocates Submitting Amendments to the National Assembly</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 14th] President Sun met with some legislators on the 14th to exchange views on the legislative procedures for reviewing the "Draft Amendment to the May 5th Constitution," and decided to hold a plenary discussion meeting in the afternoon of the 15th to discuss the matter together.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 14th] Today's editorial in the Central Daily, titled "Draft Amendment to the May 5th Constitution," clearly pointed out that the draft amendment to the May 5th Constitution (editor's note: the full text can be found in the second and third editions of today's special edition), as negotiated by the Political Consultative Conference and the Comprehensive Group Constitution Drafting Committee, should be submitted to the National Assembly. The newspaper stated: "We are not satisfied with the amendment, but this draft combines the opinions of all parties and has taken into account both practical issues and the fundamental principles of the nation, so we support Chairman Chiang's decision to submit this draft to the National Assembly." Since the news of the joint review meeting of the five committees of the Legislative Yuan on the 13th, which criticized the draft constitution for violating the teachings of the Founding Father and the resolutions of the Second Plenary Session of the Central Committee, was transmitted, most Kuomintang members have sympathized with it, and there have been various speculations that the government may not submit this amendment to the National Assembly, but instead submit the May 5th Constitution announced on the 25th. Those who are concerned about the overall situation are worried that the Third Force parties will therefore refuse to attend the National Assembly. Now that the Kuomintang's official newspaper, the Central Daily, has expressed this attitude, everyone feels relieved.</p>
<h3 id="e8">The Communist Party's Method of Dealing with the Situation Is Still Delay <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 14th] Observers in the capital, both Chinese and foreign, have seen through the Communist Party's method of dealing with the situation. The first step is to use "stop the war first, then open the National Assembly" as an excuse. When the government stops the war, they then operate in a unilateral manner and use "stop opening the National Assembly" as a prerequisite. Even during the informal comprehensive talks to discuss the content of the draft constitution, the Communist Party representatives actually said that the issue of stopping the opening of the National Assembly must be decided first, then the content of the draft constitution does not need to be discussed, which clearly shows that they do not want to solve the problem. However, although the Communist Party said that once the National Assembly is convened, they will withdraw to Yan'an, it may not be as they say, because the Communist Party is resistant to the constitution today, but they do not want a real break and decisive battle.</p>
<h3 id="e9">The Third Force Has Made a Final Effort; Peace Talks Have Come to an End; The Communist Party Delegation Is Preparing to Withdraw <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 14th] Peace talks came to an end on the evening of the 14th, and the attitudes of the various parties have become clear. However, social elites' representatives are still making a final effort all day long. Hu Lin flew from Shanghai to Beijing at 8:30 AM on the 14th. Zhang Junmai, Li Huang, and Jiang Yuntian also flew to Beijing at the same time. They then held a meeting at Jiaotong Bank at 11:00 AM and issued a public announcement at 12:00 PM, stating that they would still make a final effort in the remaining half day to save the critical situation. Zhang Junmai, Zhang Shenfu, Zhang Bojun, Shen Junru, Luo Longji, and Huang Yanpei then went to the Meiyuan New Village to attend a banquet hosted by Zhou Enlai. According to Zhang Shenfu's statement to reporters, they were going to bid farewell to Zhou Enlai. In the afternoon, Luo Longji, Huang Yanpei, Shen Junru, and Zhang Shenfu responded to Wu Tiecheng's invitation and went to Sun Ke's residence to meet with Miao Jiaming, Mo Dehui, Chen Qitian, Lei Zhen, and others, and held discussions until 5:00 PM before dispersing. Zhang Junmai, Li Huang, and Jiang Yuntian took the night train to Shanghai at 11:00 PM on the 14th.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 14th] After Zhang Junmai of the Democratic Socialist Party arrived in Beijing on the morning of the 14th with Jiang Yuntian, Li Huang, Hu Lin, and others, he immediately went to Jiaotong Bank to have secret talks with Huang Yanpei first, and then participated in the "Third Force" talks. According to reliable reports, the party's attitude is that the list of representatives has actually been drawn up. Originally, it was planned to allocate 40 out of the 120 seats in the Democratic League, but it was slightly insufficient, and after pressure from the Communist Party and other members of the Democratic League, although the party said it was not constrained, the situation seemed to have changed slightly again. Zhang Junmai expressed hope for two points: (1) The National Assembly should be postponed again to open on December 1, (2) This postponement period should be used to strive for the full realization of the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference, so that representatives can be sent to participate in the National Assembly. The Democratic Socialist Party's expression is tantamount to conditional participation, and other members of the Democratic League will mostly be watching the Communist Party's attitude to change. Since the Communist Party firmly insists that "the National Assembly must be stopped," it is not possible to satisfy them by postponement, so even if they want to participate, it is not convenient to express it directly. Zhou Enlai is probably already accusing some people of betraying their friends.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 14th] Representatives of the Democratic League and social elites gathered again at the Jiaotong Bank at 8:00 PM on the 14th. The Youth Party representatives who were originally scheduled to attend did not attend. At 9:00 PM, Zhang Shenfu, a representative of the Democratic League, said that the overall situation has been settled tonight, and there is nothing more to say. What they want to say is the same as the public announcement issued at noon. Mo Dehui, Qian Xinzhi, Miao Jiaming, Hu Lin, and Li Zhuchen, five representatives of social elites, made a statement to reporters on the registration of the National Assembly, saying that on the evening of the 11th, they felt that the overall situation was on the verge of destruction, and they jointly visited the chairman to request a postponement to make a final effort to strive for peace. At that time, there was a promise. Now that the three-day period has expired, they are approved to register tonight. Qian Xinzhi also said separately that he is a representative of the Shanghai area, and he has his voters, so he cannot but participate. Huang Yanpei said that because school students must attend classes, he must go to Shanghai at noon and night, and he will still do his best for peace if he has the opportunity.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 14th] Zhang Junmai did not make any other statement tonight. The Democratic League also did not make any statement other than the public announcement issued at noon, believing that the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference must be followed. The Communist Party is determined not to participate. Tonight, the spokesman of the Communist Party delegation said that the convocation of the National Assembly is a sign of a break. The withdrawal of the delegation has not been finalized, but it is being prepared.</p>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Zuo Shunsheng of the Youth Party came to Shanghai from Beijing at about 8:00 AM on the 14th, and took the night train back to Beijing at 10:00 PM. He will come to Shanghai again in a few days.</p>
<h3 id="e10">Huang Yanpei Comes to Shanghai; Prepares to Read Books Behind Closed Doors <a href="#e10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 14th] Huang Yanpei, who had previously made a statement on behalf of the Democratic League declaring "temporary non-participation," yesterday told others that the Communist Party's attitude is now firm and greatly different from before. There is no hope for an agreement for the time being, so he has to retreat and not ask. Therefore, he himself does not want to participate remotely, but stays to work and mediate in the future. He is preparing to take the night train back to Shanghai on the 14th, close his doors to guests, write and read books, but he also does not want to prevent others from participating in the National Assembly. Since the Communist Party now wants to go their separate ways, the government will convene the National Assembly regardless of everything, and they can only listen to it and do it well. However, the most important thing today is the government's measures, so the National Assembly's constitution-making is secondary, and how to reorganize the government is what we are most concerned about.</p>
<h3 id="e11">There Is Still Hope for Peace <a href="#e11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>Liang Shuming Discusses the Current Situation in Beiping</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 14th] Liang Shuming told reporters on the 14th: Peace still seems to be hopeful. He said: The current situation has indeed reached a dangerous juncture. Now all parties are groping on the edge of rupture in an atmosphere of rupture. It seems that there is still a way to save the situation, because the United States will definitely not want both parties to break up. The Third Force is also continuing its peace efforts, and the government also seems unwilling to go down the path of rupture. Under this situation, it is quite possible that the National Assembly will be postponed. If the National Assembly is not postponed, he judges that no faction of the Democratic League will submit a list of National Assembly representatives, and there is no sign that the Youth Party will submit a list. He claimed that since coming to Beiping, he has not left his house, but he does not refuse others to visit him. Li Zongren, Ye Jianying, and Zhang Dongsun have all been his guests. On the 14th, he went to Yanjing University to lecture on "Superficial and Profound," and is scheduled to fly to Chongqing on the 21st to preside over his Mianren College.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, This City] Zhang Jia'ao, Director of the Economic Committee of the Northeast Headquarters, arrived in Shanghai from Beijing at 2:30 PM on the 13th, and flew back to the capital at 6:30 AM yesterday.

<h3 id="e13">The Government Attaches Importance to Relief in North China; Gu Zhenglun Will Go to Supervise; Hebei Provincial Government Decides to Establish a Relief Brigade <a href="#e13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 14th] The government attaches importance to the relief problem in the recovered areas of the National Army in North China, and will send Minister Gu Zhenglun to North China to supervise. It is heard that Mr. Gu is expected to come to North China around the 20th of this month. In addition to Hebei Province, Mr. Gu will go to Chahar, Suiyuan, and even Jin and Rehe Provinces to inspect. The central government initially approved 500 million yuan for the Hebei emergency relief fund. After Zhang Ji and Lu Zhonglin strongly argued with President Song, the Executive Yuan has increased it to 1.5 billion yuan. In addition, the Pacification District Political Affairs Committee has allocated 4,000 tons of flour and 500 tons of glutinous rice. The first batch of 2,000 tons of flour is expected to arrive in Tianjin on the 20th of this month, and the second batch of 2,000 tons will also arrive before the 5th of next month. In order to distribute the relief funds and flour, the Hebei Provincial Government will establish a relief brigade. The brigade headquarters will be located in Beiping, and will have several squadrons under its jurisdiction. The initial plan is to allocate one squadron each to Tangshan, Cangxian, and Baoding, and it is also planned to set up one squadron in Dongming, southern Hebei. According to personnel who went to Shenyang, the government's allocation of relief grain and funds is not small this time. If this flour is converted into price, it is only about 6 billion yuan. If it is distributed equally among the 300,000 refugees in Hebei, it will only be more than two catties per person, which is still a drop in the bucket.</p>

<p>[Report from our Jinan Office, 13th] During their period of standstill, the Lu Communist army continued to reinforce and redeploy, seeking opportunities to attack the National Army. On the evening of the 12th, more than a thousand Communist police brigade soldiers suddenly attacked Xinglongzhuang (ten kilometers south of the city), outside Jinan.

<p>[Report from our Jinan Office, Bian, 14th] The situation in the Jinan suburbs, from the evening of the 12th to the morning of the 14th, was tragic. The Communist army continued to mobilize reinforcements and artillery from the Bohai Military Region, fiercely attacking Qidong (located northeast of Jinan, north of Zhangqiu). The National Army is fighting desperately to defend it. On the night of the 13th, a portion of the Communist Police Seventh Brigade and about six thousand men from the Boxingdian and Rao Independent Battalions fiercely attacked Linzi County city. The National Army fought back valiantly, and after a fierce battle, the Communist army finally collapsed and retreated to the east and west of the ancient city north of Linzi on the morning of the 14th.</p>
<p>[Report from our Xuzhou Office, 14th] Yuan Ye, commander of the Communist Bohai Military Region, recently led more than 20,000 Communist troops, fleeing from Huimin in northern Shandong to Linyi, plotting to attack Jinan.

<p>[Report from our Zhenjiang Office, 14th] After the ceasefire order was issued, the Communist army of Binhai, Dongtai, continuously attacked the National Army in Qizao and Jiuzao counties. The garrison at Qizao was once caught off guard. Later, the National Army stationed in the city rushed to their aid, and after a day and night of fierce fighting, the Communist army was unable to withstand the attack and collapsed.

<h3 id="e18">The Communist Side Has Not Yet Responded to the Ceasefire Memorandum <a href="#e18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>[Report from our Beiping Office, 14th] The Communist side of the Military Mediation Execution Department has not yet responded to the government's ceasefire memorandum, but there is no sign that they are about to withdraw. Communist spokesman Huang Hua told reporters on the 14th that the Military Mediation Execution Department can only accept orders from the military three-person group and take action accordingly. The Communist side of the Execution Department believes that there is no need to consider matters individually raised by Chairman Chiang. The spokesman denied reports that the three committee members of the Execution Department will hold a meeting, saying that neither side has proposed a meeting recently. It is also inaccurate to say that the Execution Department will hold a meeting to restore traffic. As of the afternoon of the 14th, the Communist side of the Execution Department has not received any orders or instructions from Yan'an or Nanjing regarding withdrawal, nor has it made any preparations for withdrawal. The Military Mediation Execution Department still has flights between Beiping and Yan'an every Wednesday. Yesterday's flight only carried Mr. Smorson, representative of the British Liberal Party newspaper, and Mr. Jode Drake, reporter for the Associated Press. Mr. Hurleigh, reporter for the New York Times, was brought back from Yan'an. No Communist personnel traveled back and forth. According to the spokesman, there are still more than thirty Communist personnel working in the Execution Department, and if the personnel dispatched to various groups are included, there are still about two hundred people.</p>

Mr. Shen told reporters, "Nanjing has excellent natural conditions, with mountains, rivers, plains, lush trees, and forests, all the conditions of a modern city. If it is coordinated with the urban construction plan, Nanjing should be the most excellent area in the country. Nanjing is a city that has not yet been fully established and has unlimited development prospects. The most urgent problem to be solved in Nanjing is the transportation problem. If the traffic is smooth, the distance between each other will be shortened, and all the difficulties caused by the obstruction can be solved. When reporters inquired about whether there would be any changes in the personnel of the municipal government, Mr. Shen said: "We should establish a new style. The current staff are strong in ability and familiar with the local situation. They should never be changed due to the transfer of one person. In the near future, they will all be my friends, and the future of the capital's municipal construction is purely based on our cooperation."</p>

<h3 id="e23">Regulations on the Disposal of Real Estate Purchased by the Soviet Union in Changchun Stipulate that Purchase Is Permitted but the Land Must Be Leased <a href="#e23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Changchun, 13th] The Changchun City Police Department recently requested instructions from the Changchun Branch of the Northeast Enemy and Puppet Enterprise Assets Unified Receival Committee on how to handle the fact that the Soviet Far East Trading Company, jointly organized by the Soviet government and the China Changchun Railway after "August 15" last year, had purchased Japanese-owned real estate in Changchun that should belong to the Chinese government. The Changchun Branch of the Unified Receival Committee considered this matter to be of great importance and requested instructions from the General Committee. The General Committee considered the matter to be a matter of diplomacy and telegraphed Foreign Minister Wang Shijie for instructions. A reply telegram was received, stating that the houses purchased by the Soviet Ministry of Foreign Trade from the Japanese should still be leased or borrowed after they are returned. If the Soviet Union refuses to accept this method, in order to show friendship to the Soviet Union, they may be purchased in particular, but the land on which the houses are located must be leased on a regular basis. This is the most favorable treatment that third countries can currently enjoy, etc. Zhang Jiaao, chairman of the General Committee, immediately formulated a plan according to the instructions in the telegram. The main points are as follows: (1) The Central Government, in order to express special friendship, specially allows the Soviet side to have the right to purchase a fixed amount of property in the Northeast. This right is limited to one time and cannot be used as a precedent or a fixed right; (2) In order to avoid disputes, the Soviet side should be asked to specifically and clearly propose the area and location of the property and the attached leased land that it intends to purchase. We will send personnel to conduct a joint survey. If there is no possibility of a dispute over property rights, it will be treated as public property, and then a contract will be signed; (3) The Chinese side of the contracting parties is the agent designated by the municipal government; (4) The lease term is set at ten years. If the lease is to be renewed after the expiration of the term, both parties may negotiate an extension, but the maximum extension shall not exceed three years; (5) After the expiration of the lease term, the houses shall be returned to China at no cost. If the houses are damaged and need to be rebuilt before the expiration of the lease term, the consent of the lessor must be obtained, and they must still be returned to China at no cost upon expiration; (6) The use of the land is limited to the ground, and no digging or installation of electrical infrastructure or military facilities is allowed; (7) The lessee shall bear the obligations stipulated by Chinese law; (8) The leased or purchased houses shall not be transferred, sold, mortgaged, or sublet. According to reporter inquiries, the Soviet Far East Trading Company purchased a total of forty-one houses in Changchun, with a total purchase price of 3,925,000 yuan. The house prices were all paid in Soviet military notes.</p>
<p>Responsible Person of the External Affairs Talks</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 14th] After the announcement of the measures for handling the purchase of real estate by the Soviet Union in Changchun, reporters visited responsible persons of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to understand the truth. It is said that "After Japan surrendered last year, the Executive Yuan announced that all Japanese property within Chinese territory, whether belonging to the Japanese government or private individuals, shall be taken over by the Chinese government as part of Japan's compensation to China. Without the permission of the Chinese government, the ownership of this item shall not be transferred. Our government has notified the Soviet side of this intention. In the future, if the Soviet side wants to purchase real estate in various places, it must still be with the permission of our government."</p>

<h3 id="e26">UNRRA Far East Regional Conference Concludes, Passes Important Recommendations, Requests the Headquarters to Completely Cancel the Embargo Order <a href="#e26" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c26" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">26</a></h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] The UNRRA Far East Regional Committee held a meeting in Shanghai the day before yesterday to elect a chairman and discuss relief work, supplies, and funding. It ended at 5:00 PM yesterday. During the meeting yesterday, the US representative suggested that the conference pass a proposal requesting the Washington Headquarters to completely cancel its order to stop the transportation of supplies to China. The Soviet representative stated that UNRRA Director General LaGuardia had previously decided to announce the suspension of transportation order for two reasons: (1) Because Chinese ports had not been cleared, it was temporarily inconvenient to transport a large number of supplies; (2) Because some of the supplies transported to China had political implications. Therefore, he requested that this suggestion be considered before a decision was made. Li Zhuomin, Deputy Director General of the Administrative Yuan Relief Committee, immediately declared that the ports in the city had been cleared, the supplies had been declared, and he guaranteed that the supplies received would have no political implications. The conference passed a request to the UNRRA Headquarters to completely cancel the suspension of transportation order.</p>
<p>Funding Issues of the Administrative Yuan Relief Committee</p>
<p>During the meeting yesterday afternoon, many opinions were expressed regarding the source of funding for the Administrative Yuan Relief Committee. UNRRA British representative Stant expressed that UNRRA's work in China had not been fully developed due to a lack of funding, and he hoped that the Chinese government could provide assistance to the Administrative Yuan Relief Committee. US representative Gaber Que Lire pointed out that even including all income, the Administrative Yuan Relief Committee was still short of 130 billion yuan by the end of this year. Could this be subsidized by the Executive Yuan? Mr. Shi also said that UNRRA's sale of supplies should not be the main source of income for the agency, but should be a secondary source of income.</p>
<p>Li Zhuomin immediately explained that the Administrative Yuan Relief Committee's funding came from the sale of supplies, government subsidies, and a portion of bank loans. The income from the sale of supplies was actually limited. Not only was it difficult to collect money for the sold items, but the transportation costs were also difficult to meet, and other income was not sufficient to make up for it.</p>
<p>Study of the Situation in Korea</p>
<p>The conference also passed a motion to elect Soviet representative Siminas as chairman of the small group studying the situation in Korea, and requested that the Korean delegation send personnel to report on the group's disaster relief situation in order to actively carry out the work. It was also decided that the next conference will be held on January 15 next year.</p>

<p>Miss Gao Elaborately Designed the Aircraft Emblem, Chennault Adopted and Approved Its Application</p>
<p>[City News] The UNRRA Air Transport Team, since its establishment on the 25th of last month, has begun active preparations. The planes needed by the team are currently being purchased by the Executive Yuan Relief Committee in conjunction with UNRRA in the Philippines and Hawaii, and are expected to be flown to China before the end of this month. It is learned that the aircraft emblem of the Air Transport Team has been painted in watercolor by Ms. Gao Keshan, symbolizing a tiger-shaped kitten squatting and looking up at the sky, with a white star and a radiant sun supporting it. The colors are bright and eye-catching, and it has been adopted by General Chennault for application. Ms. Gao is a high-achieving student of the Shanghai Chinese and Western Girls' School, specializes in fine arts. During the Anti-Japanese War, she traveled from Shanghai to Henggui, and worked in the base of the Fourteenth Air Force. After Henggui fell, she followed the army to Kunming and continued to work under the Flying Tigers Brigade. After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War last year, she returned to Shanghai in November. It is heard that she will go to Guangzhou in the next few days to assume her new position in the UNRRA Air Transport Team.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Bian, 4th] After the Sino-French negotiations on the Vietnam issue came to an end, reporters specially visited Miss Luo Heng and Miss Zhang Bangzhen, representatives of the Yunnan National Assembly, to ask for their opinions on Sino-French relations. It is said that the friendship between China and France should be enhanced, but the Vietnam issue is related to the interests of overseas Chinese and Yunnan, and should be resolved as soon as possible. At present, the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway has not yet been repaired, which has a great impact on the economic transportation of Yunnan and the southwest. Overseas Chinese have not yet received reasonable treatment, and the public and private property looted and destroyed by the Japanese in Vietnam during the war has not yet been liquidated and compensated, all of which urgently need to be implemented. Because Yunnan borders Vietnam, the people of Yunnan are particularly concerned about the resolution of the Vietnam issue. In the future, it is hoped that the government will consider the opinions of the people of Yunnan, Guangxi, and other provinces at any time in order to seek a practical and reasonable solution.</p>

<h3 id="e32">Editorial: A Fair Discussion of the Draft Constitution <a href="#e32" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c32" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">32</a></h3>
<p>--And Congratulations on the Opening of the National Assembly</p>
<p>Since the National Assembly was postponed to today, and the Joint Conference of the Five Committees of the Legislative Yuan did not review the revised draft of the May 5th Constitution Draft Amendment, the issue of the constitution has been of concern to the world. The purpose of convening the National Assembly was to draft a constitution, and the drafting of a constitution requires a draft constitution as a basis. The National Assembly, which is dedicated to drafting a constitution, is scheduled to open in Nanjing today, but the revised draft of the May 5th Constitution Draft Amendment, which was submitted by the chairman to the Legislative Yuan for review and amendment based on the "Political Consultative Conference" amendment principles, has not yet been adopted and reviewed by the Legislative Yuan. Therefore, the focus of the current political situation is undoubtedly on drafting a constitution to establish a solid foundation for the country's long-term stability.</p>
<p>The reason why the Legislative Yuan did not accept the review of the revised draft of the May 5th Constitution Draft Amendment this time is reportedly because the procedure for submitting it for review did not comply with the regulations. This case did not result from a resolution of the Central Standing Committee or a resolution of the Supreme National Defense Council, but was only issued to the Legislative Yuan by the Chairman by telegram. This case is of great importance, and it seems that it does not comply with the regulations. If the Legislative Yuan's review of the revised draft of the Constitution Draft Amendment is only a procedural issue, then it is simple; it also includes a substantive issue, that is, whether the provisions in the revised draft are contrary to the Three People's Principles upon which our country is founded. This is an important issue. As far as the Legislative Yuan is concerned, it already has the May 5th Constitution, which was promulgated by the National Government, unless there are instructions from the Central Standing Committee or the Supreme National Defense Council, it is not appropriate to change it rashly. This position can be understood by the people of the country. Law is not outside human feelings, and we cannot erase the current objective facts with one stroke. Regarding the procedure, it was originally due to time constraints that this expedient measure had to be taken; now that it has been raised, supplementing the procedures may make it comply with the provisions of the legislative procedure in a timely manner. However, the problem is still lurking; the so-called procedural issue is only another manifestation of this lurking problem.</p>
<p>What is this lurking problem? First, the May 5th Constitution was promulgated by the National Government based on the constitution draft passed by the Legislative Yuan. The "Political Consultative Conference" is an organization outside the national legal system, and its resolutions have no binding effect on the National Government; the constitution draft already promulgated by the National Government cannot be rashly cancelled due to the resolutions of the "Political Consultative Conference." This is theoretically beyond reproach, but the distance from the current objective facts is too far. It seems more advisable to accept reality. It is true that the "Political Consultative Conference" is a type of organization outside the national legal system, and its resolutions naturally do not have their legal status and effect; but if this informal resolution without legal effect is accepted by the government through proper procedures, it may be regarded as a kind of will of the government itself, and thus have an effect. At this time, we do not seem to need to adhere to legal principles, and there are many things that are not completely understandable in theory.</p>
<p>But the core of the problem is still: Does the revised Constitution Draft Amendment, which was revised based on the constitutional amendment principles passed by the "Political Consultative Conference," truly conform to the spirit of the Three People's Principles? Here we must eliminate two preconceived notions: (1) Although the May 5th Constitution was drafted in accordance with the spirit of the Three People's Principles, it may not necessarily be the best expression of the spirit of the Three People's Principles, and it is absolutely not allowed to be revised; (2) Although the resolutions of the "Political Consultative Conference" are made by various parties and factions as well as non-party and non-factional people, they may not necessarily be contrary to the spirit of the Three People's Principles. There are no established rules to follow for drafting the Three People's Principles Constitution, and all facts are first created. The drafting of the May 5th Constitution previously took great effort and fully reflected the spirit of the Three People's Principles; but given the evolution of the past ten years, especially in recent years, it is questionable whether the system it established is the most ideal. Therefore, we must absolutely not stick to preconceived notions and think that only the May 5th Constitution is the most ideal expression of the spirit of the Three People's Principles. As for the resolutions of the "Political Consultative Conference," although there are places that are not very closely tied to the Three People's Principles, they are not necessarily entirely contrary to the spirit of the Three People's Principles. According to news reports, the revised constitution draft that the government intends to submit to the National Assembly but has not yet been reviewed by the Legislative Yuan still adheres to the strict position of the Three People's Principles while complying with the resolutions of the "Political Consultative Conference." It is very obvious that its revision is not necessarily contrary to the spirit of the Three People's Principles; moreover, our Chairman and Legislative Yuan President Sun Ke personally gave instructions on the drafting of this amendment, so it can be imagined that its basic position is not contrary to the Three People's Principles. Therefore, this revision of the constitution should be able to serve as the basis for the National Assembly to draft the constitution.</p>
<p>Now that the National Assembly is holding its opening ceremony, the fundamental law of the country, which is the basis for our country's long-term stability, will be formulated by the Assembly and put into effect. What we cannot but state here is that although the National Assembly representatives come from all sides, they should have a common ideal of building a new China of the Three People's Principles. The drafting of this constitution should fully express the spirit of the Three People's Principles. Therefore, we cannot stick to preconceived notions, but since the constitution is the fundamental law of the country, we cannot be hasty and must review it thoroughly before it can be effective. How can we enable our country to have a perfect constitution? This depends on the convening of this National Assembly. On the occasion of the opening of the National Assembly, we extend our sincere congratulations to the National Assembly. May the convening of this National Assembly lay the foundation for our country's long-term stability!</p>

<p>[Our newspaper's Suzhou dispatch on the 14th] The County Administration Review Meeting for the counties in the Second District of Jiangsu Province is scheduled to open in Suzhou at 9:00 a.m. on the 15th. The county magistrates and military and financial section chiefs of the eight counties of Suzhou, Wuxi, Wutai, Yu Kun, Wucheng, and Cheng have all gathered in Suzhou to report. It is reported that the focus of the meeting is to review the progress of county administration in the past year. The content focuses on public security, conscription, opium prohibition, transportation, reorganization of baojia, national education, and self-defense corps.

The above are all instructed to submit written reports separately, which will be reviewed one by one by the conference, and then concrete guidelines for the future will be proposed to seek progress.</p>
<p>[Our newspaper's Suzhou dispatch on the 14th] The Financial Affairs Review Meeting for the Second District of Jiangsu Province continued to be held from 9:00 a.m. on the 14th, and successfully concluded at 6:00 p.m. after a noon break. The attendees were very enthusiastic throughout the two days of the conference. More than ten major cases were resolved. Director Dong of the Finance Department promised to give more instructions, which are of great significance to the financial and tax relations of Jiangsu Province in the future, and have a great impact on the interests of the people. Suzhou will briefly record the following major cases:</p>
<p>Issues Regarding the Handling of Grain Collection</p>
<p>(1) Regarding the handling of in-kind collection of land tax, Jiangsu Province has been ordered to sell all of it to the central government at price, and all counties and cities must not use it without authorization. However, in order to take into account the urgent needs of the localities, the Provincial General Office has drafted two methods: A. Counties that collect public grain should receive 15 percent. This number can be issued by the county and city for consumption by the security police team. If it is still insufficient, a portion can be allocated from 50 percent of the land tax; B. The land tax will be allocated and sold to the central government, and the price will be evaluated monthly to avoid losses to the localities, and the Ministry of Food should first allocate two-thirds of the funds, and the remaining amount will be settled after the grain tax is paid. However, the above methods should be implemented after obtaining the consent of the central government. (2) The management issues of county and city pawnshops shall be jointly formulated and implemented by the Finance and Construction Bureaus. (3) Regarding the public treasury system, county and city deed tax, business tax, business license tax, house rent, banquet tax, entertainment tax, and other tax revenues shall be collected by personnel dispatched by the public treasury to the collection agency. However, rural areas can submit them on a ten-day basis. (4) Regarding the reorganization of public funds and property, the county and city finance section chiefs shall be practically responsible for thoroughly abolishing the previous system of earmarked funds. The clearing period has been extended to June 36. (5) Regarding the issue of township production, according to the principle of national mandatory labor service, the surplus manpower during the agricultural off-season should be utilized, and with the approval of the township people's representative congress, production undertakings such as wasteland reclamation, afforestation, animal husbandry, fish farming, and small-scale handicraft industry should be engaged in without hindering the work of the farmers themselves. If a small amount of working capital is needed, loans can be obtained from the Agricultural Bank. Fifty percent of the income will be used for national education expenses, and the rest will belong to the original township as self-government expenses. Counties and cities are not allowed to use it. (6) The county and city governments must approve and issue the regular expenses of the county-level agencies by the 10th of each month at the latest. (7) If the enemy and puppet materials received by the county and city have been spent, the proceeds should be remitted to the treasury in full.</p>
<p>Issues Regarding Taxation Collection</p>
<p>(8) The collection of donations and taxes should be based on direct inspection and collection as a principle, and the recognition method is only a temporary measure. Once assessed, there will often be refunds. (9) Counties and cities should actively start to complete the survey form of people's economic burden. (10) Loans from the past to localities should be repaid in full before the land tax is fully paid. (11) The financial policy in the future should be to reorganize various legal tax sources, and no new taxes should be created. County and city budgets should not collect income falsely and spend it actually, and a reserve fund should be retained to adjust the salaries of public school employees. It is known that Director Dong and his party will come to Wujiang to inspect on the morning of the 15th, and return to the province that evening. They will go to Songjiang again on the 23rd of this month to convene a review meeting for the fourth district.</p>

<p>[Ningbo dispatch] Two ships sailing between Ningbo and Jintang Dapu, Lao Da Zhang Afang and Rong Chengliang, carrying more than 30 passengers, including Li Yongchun, departed from Yong at 1:00 p.m. on the 8th. When they arrived outside Zhenhai Port, it was already dusk. Due to the tide, they temporarily anchored in the Qingzhi waters. At the same time, a red and white bottom sailboat (pirate ship) from Zhenhai was heading to Shenjiamen. Ship captain Zhang Afang saw that its actions were suspicious and was about to raise anchor to escape. Unexpectedly, the pirate ship fired a gun to scare them into not moving, and then approached the stern of the ship. Another ship, seeing that the situation was not good, also wanted to escape back. At that time, the bandits fired very fiercely, and there was no way to avoid it, and it was also harmed. At that time, the two ships were dragged to the waters between Jintang and Dapu, and the passengers were looted for three hours, with a total loss of 50,000 yuan in gold and silver jewelry, items, and cash. After the robbery, they left safely.</p>

<p>[Our newspaper's Fengxian dispatch] The three bandits, Mo Degang, Wu Ahai (from Songjiang), and Li Ahong, were remnants of the bandit Yang Kequan's gang. They repeatedly kidnapped and robbed in Songjiang Yexie and Zhuangxing in this county. They also hijacked a car in Tingmin, committing numerous crimes. The self-defense forces of towns such as Fahua in this county successively captured the bandits, presented them to the Pudong Joint Defense Office for interrogation. They confessed without denying it. Now, the Joint Defense Office has telegraphed the Wuxi Command Post of the Capital Garrison Headquarters for approval and sentenced them to death. At 2:00 p.m. on the 13th, the three criminals were identified and escorted to Zhuangxing Town, the scene of the incident, for execution by shooting to serve as a warning. According to reports, the gang of bandit Yang Kequan and Chen Mingxi raged in the border area of Song and Feng, and the local area suffered a lot. The two bandit leaders, Yang and Chen, were dispatched by the military authorities of Muxian County to encircle and arrest them on the 5th of this month, and were killed on the spot. The remnants are now also subject to the law. From now on, the security of the border area can be assured.</p>
<h3 id="e40">Commercial Decline in the Punan Area <a href="#e40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>[Our newspaper's Fengxian dispatch] In the Punan area, agriculture, industry, and commerce have been greatly weakened by the situation in recent years. This year's cotton and rice harvests were poor, and the economy is even more stagnant. After entering winter, agricultural products have depreciated step by step. Cotton is less than 30,000 per dan, and white rice is only about 40,000 per shi. Other daily necessities have risen sharply. As a result, the rural economy is on the verge of bankruptcy. Industry and commerce have been affected in conjunction. The purchasing power of the general public has declined, and the business of various merchants has plummeted. Even the landlords only receive 20 to 30 percent of the rent.</p>

<p>[Our newspaper's Suzhou dispatch] Xing Lufeng, the contractor of the Rent Collection Sub-Office in Xiangcheng District, was ordered to distribute land rent notification forms to villages such as Xuanzhu and Tianjing. At about 10:00 p.m. on the 9th, he was gathered by nearby tenant farmers. More than a hundred people rushed to Xing's house in Xisha Village, demolished the house, destroyed property, and tied Xing up with ropes, causing serious injuries with iron tools. After his family accompanied him to the city to report, the County Rent Collection Office immediately telegraphed County Magistrate Lu and requested immediate emergency action. Upon hearing the report, County Magistrate Lu believed that this trend must not be allowed to grow and dispatched the County Police Detachment Commander Liu Ren, leading 40 squad soldiers fully armed, to the scene of the incident in the countryside, together with the township office of the district in charge. They immediately arrested Wu Caibao and other five tenant farmers who instigated and incited, and escorted them to the city for detention on the evening of the 12th, pending interrogation and severe punishment.</p>
<h3 id="e42">Guaranteeing Traveler Safety; Long-Distance Buses Defend Themselves <a href="#e42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>[Our newspaper's Wuxi dispatch] Long-distance buses running on various highways in Jiangsu Province are often robbed by bandits, and bandits posing as passengers lurk in the car and take the opportunity to rob. The safety of travelers is endangered, and the military and police protection in remote areas of various lines is inevitably inadequate. In order to actively prevent and ensure the safety of travelers, the Provincial Construction Department believes that it is necessary for various long-distance bus companies to establish self-defense armed forces to protect them along with the bus. It has notified various long-distance bus companies operating on each line to comply as soon as possible and ordered the Highway Bureau to instruct other commercially operated long-distance bus companies to comply. The county governments are ordered to supervise strictly.</p>

<p>[Our newspaper's Bengbu dispatch] Soldiers from a certain secret service battalion stationed in Bengbu suddenly clashed with the city police over a trivial matter on the morning of the 11th, resulting in a bloody tragedy. According to the investigation: at about 11:00 a.m. on the morning of the 11th, soldiers from the First Company of a certain secret service battalion were transporting rice bags in a truck, and when they arrived in front of the Traffic Villa on Erma Road, they crashed into a rickshaw and quarreled and fought with the rickshaw puller. Several policemen from the Third Branch of the police happened to pass by and stepped forward to mediate. A certain soldier got angry at the policemen and beat them in the street. The policemen took the offending soldier and the rickshaw puller to the station for interrogation. Before long, many more soldiers gathered and broke into the Third Branch, beating everyone they saw and taking away the household registration officer Yang Mingyi. The offending soldier also left with him. Many policemen chased to Wuchalu, and the soldiers opened fire, wounding three policemen. For a time, soldiers ran around the streets, beating any police officers they saw, resulting in a two-hour strike in the afternoon.

<p>Criminal Police Go to Search and Arrest Three People</p>
<p>[Our newspaper's Jiading dispatch] The Muyi County Government received a letter from the Taicang County Government, stating that a large number of former enemy and puppet personnel were hiding in the border area of the three counties of Jiabao and Tai, oppressing the villagers and committing many evils. Recently, they have been selling firearms, attempting to conspire. The County Government immediately ordered the Criminal Police Team to send police to Wu Lane Township to encircle and arrest them. They arrested Zhou Jingfu, a secret agent of the former enemy puppet Shanghai Gendarmerie Headquarters, and seized a self-defense pistol (number 38721) with four bullets from his side.

<p>[Our newspaper's Suzhou dispatch] The pawnbroking industry in this county has heavy profits to be made, so those with idle funds regard it as a way to make money and flock to it. When the guild was established this spring, it was estimated to have only dozens of shops. Afterwards, they were added one after another, almost like bamboo shoots after a rain. Everywhere, whether on the main street or in the alley, only one corner outside Jumen has more than 20 shops according to the survey. It is estimated that there are more than 100 shops in total. However, the interest rate is high, and the poor who trade with them are like drinking poison to quench their thirst. All sectors of society have repeatedly appealed to the government to establish public pawnshops as a remedy. Unexpectedly, according to a recent survey, the entire Suzhou pawnbroking industry is depressed due to too many businesses, and their operations are not flourishing. In addition, the expenses are huge, and there are too many losses. Those who do not have the means to transfer to the point of bankruptcy cause a threat and extreme pain to the poor. The County Government has noticed this and, in addition to actively planning to widely establish public pawnshops, has decided on emergency measures and warned Wang Renchu, the director of the trade guild, that as of today, no new pawnbroking shops are allowed. In order to avoid social unrest, those that have been established are restricted and are not allowed to be merged or relocated, and those that have been closed and are waiting to be redeemed are not allowed to be replaced and reopened, so as to reduce the deeper crisis in the future.</p>

<h3 id="e57">The Appeal of the Barber Stall Owners <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>We are a group of barber stall owners in the alleys of the city. There are more than 4,000 people in the city who make a living from this, excluding family members. Although our business locations are scattered in the streets and alleys, they have all been legally leased, and we have fully considered traffic and hygiene issues. It can be said that there is no situation of "obstructing hygiene and hindering traffic."</p>
<p>Our customers are salaried workers and the working class, because the price we charge is only one-half of that of ordinary shops, so we are deeply praised by the public.</p>
<p>On the 10th of last month, the Barber Industry Guild of this city convened a representative meeting of various districts. They reported a proposal: "Street stalls are crowded, and business in the shops is sluggish. The guild has submitted a request to the police authorities to ban them. A reply from the mayor has been received, approving the ban, and the Health Bureau will send a letter to the police bureau and the health sub-stations to conduct inspections at any time," and so on.</p>
<p>Poor us, a small group, live the most humble lives. Seeing such a shocking message, we were all dumbfounded, as if a thunderbolt had struck on a sunny day. If a ban were to be implemented, we have no other skills, and it is impossible to steal. Apart from "waiting to die," what other options do we have? But as the days passed, we did not encounter a ban.</p>
<p>Seeing that we were still operating as usual, the trade guild was determined to put the lives of thousands of us to death and submitted a supplementary application to aggravate our crime, saying that we "obstruct traffic and harm hygiene." The so-called "if you want to condemn someone, there is no need to worry about finding an excuse." If our stalls had violated the two clauses they mentioned, the police authorities would have already started to ban them without the trade guild submitting a document. Thinking from this point of view, it is entirely a matter of jealousy in business, which is the most obvious fact.</p>
<p>Recently, our misfortune has come. The police bureau has really approved their request to implement a ban and set a deadline for closing the business. We are not capitalists, and we have no backing. We are poor stall owners, who dare to disobey orders. In the absence of any other options, we have no choice but to petition the authorities and ask people from all walks of life to sympathize with us and give us a way to survive. (Zhou Xuequan)</p>
<h3 id="e58">Why Shanghai Doesn't Ban Dancing <a href="#e58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>"Dance halls" - what a pleasant and beautiful name. However, their existence, whether directly or indirectly, what benefit do they bring to the nation and society? I can make a firm statement: "They are entirely harmful and bring no benefit." I know many people will think I am exaggerating, but the facts are as follows:</p>
<p>How magnificent is its (the dance hall's) appearance, with waves of exciting and enthusiastic music, and melodious singing, broadcast on the streets every night. But what about its inner reality? Sin, shamelessness, baseness, decadence. How many ambitious young people fall here, how many honest and upright officials become corrupt because of it, how many law-abiding people resort to theft, extortion, and deception because they come here! What is most heartbreaking is that a group of intellectual young people from the highest institutions of learning have abandoned their precious books and are hiding here, wasting their time!</p>
<p>This sinful dance hall - a gold-consuming pit in the city - directly bewitches many clear-headed people, sucks up a lot of ill-gotten money, and indirectly affects the peace of the entire society and the strength of the nation. Since this is the case, why should it exist? Is it a necessary embellishment for a big city? Or is it because this kind of entertainment is popular in the United States, and our poor country should also try to imitate it?</p>
<p>Suppose: if the capital of all the dance halls in the city were pooled together to open a larger factory, imagine how many unemployed workers could be helped, and how many practical goods could be produced? This would be truly embarking on the road to building a new China.</p>
<p>If dance halls are closed, the most serious issue is how to solve the livelihood problems of the dance hostesses. Many, many people say: the dance hostesses are pitiful, their offering of hugs and embraces is entirely out of desperation due to the pressure of life. However, I must solemnly say, "They are not pitiful at all." The reason they engage in this profession is not entirely driven by life; half of it is due to their own wrong thinking and excessive vanity. They also have a pair of all-powerful hands. In the beginning, they could have tried to find another job. Why did they have to step into the circle of sin? Of course, they wanted to be more comfortable and earn more money, so they jumped into the deep pool without hesitation. Imagine, at a time when the country is plagued by war, disasters, and widespread suffering, do we still need to pity these people who have lost their way due to their pursuit of vanity and enjoyment?</p>
<p>In conclusion, dancing is an improper form of entertainment. Moreover, with the nation's destiny precarious and the country's construction difficult, how can we continue to indulge in the intoxicating pleasures of sensual entertainment? We should ban it, eliminate it. What is puzzling is that dancing has already been banned in places like Nanjing and Hangzhou, so why can't it be implemented in Shanghai alone?</p>
<p>Finally, I hope the municipal government authorities can accept my suggestion. (Wang Huang)</p>

Although workers do not have days off on Sundays, they receive additional salary increases at the end of the month. If there are any shortcomings, we are working on ways to improve them."</p>

<p>[French News Agency, Paris, 14th] The Political Bureau of the French Communist Party met this morning and decided to demand that a Communist Party member be appointed as Prime Minister. This is the result of the Communist Party's recent victory in the general election. At the same time, the Central Committee of the Socialist Party is scheduled to meet on the 17th, and the Communist Party has decided to contact them and propose the formation of a coalition government. This government will be headed by a Communist Party member and will be a democratic, anti-clerical, and socialized government.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Paris, 13th] According to today's news, French Prime Minister Bidault has urged that the permanent government of the new Fourth Republic be formed immediately after the first meeting of the parliament on November 28, without waiting for the election of the new president. Bidault's reason for advocating the rapid formation of a permanent cabinet is that many diplomatic and domestic issues urgently need to be resolved and cannot wait for two months. In order to support this proposal with concrete actions, the Bidault cabinet will submit its resignation when the parliament convenes.</p>
<p>[French New News Agency, Paris, 13th] The French cabinet held a meeting this morning, where the interim president and prime minister and foreign minister, Bidault, reported on the international situation, followed by the minister of overseas territories, Moutet, reporting on the situation in Vietnam, and finally by the minister of labor, Croizat, reporting on the issue of Italian immigrants.</p>

According to what reporters have learned from contacting some French people, most French people in Vietnam believe that it is better to have more contact with countries such as Britain and the United States since their vitality has not yet recovered after the war, and they do not welcome the Communist Party's victory. Vietnamese people, both official and non-official, unanimously welcome the French Communist Party's victory.</p>

<p>[This Newspaper News] San Francisco, 14th Broadcast: Since the four foreign ministers resumed discussions on the Italian Peace Treaty, they have apparently reached a deadlock today. Molotov's proposed 14 minimum revisions to the regulations for the Free Territory of Trieste have been opposed by the United States, Britain, and France, and the Soviet Union has insisted on not giving way. If the four powers cannot reach an agreement on the Trieste issue, the British and American troops will remain stationed in the Trieste area indefinitely, and everything will have to be handled by the Trusteeship Council.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, New York, 13th] Today, Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov proposed 14 revisions to the draft regulations for the Free Territory of Trieste and told the foreign ministers of the United States, Britain, and France that these measures are the Soviet Union's minimum conditions for resolving the Trieste issue. The main points of the suggestions are to weaken the powers of the Governor of Trieste. The Soviet Union wants to make this governor a formal head and establish a strong parliament. The United States and Britain opposed the Soviet Union's suggestion that British and American troops should withdraw from this area within a certain period after the signing of the Italian Peace Treaty, stating that this point should be decided by the United Nations. The United States and Britain also firmly opposed the suggestion that Trieste should be governed by the Four Foreign Ministers' Meeting instead of the Security Council before the implementation of the permanent regulations.</p>

<p>[Associated Press, Lake Success, 13th] The Union of South Africa today proposed annexing Southwest Africa. General Smuts told the Trusteeship Council that the Union of South Africa refused to accept the trusteeship of Southwest Africa. If the proposal for annexation is not passed, South Africa will continue to govern the former German colony under the League of Nations mandate. The Soviet Union, Yugoslavia, Belarus, Ukraine, Poland, China, and India opposed South Africa's annexation request.</p>
<p>[Reuters, New York, 14th] South African Prime Minister Smuts recently broadcasted that the Soviet Union has two standards, one for itself and one for other small countries such as South Africa. For its own security, the Soviet Union annexed vast territories such as the Kuril Islands without seeking anyone's opinion. However, when South Africa made a request to the United Nations for Southwest Africa for its own security, the Soviet Union expressed opposition. Should the world necessarily acknowledge that the security principles of strong and weak countries should be different?</p>

<p>[This Newspaper News] Paris, 14th Broadcast Washington News: White House Secretary Ross announced at a press conference: US Army and Navy leaders will hold a meeting today to discuss the reduction of the defense budget. President's Chief of Staff Leahy, Army Chief of Staff Eisenhower, and Chief of Naval Operations Nimitz will all participate. The government will respond to the Republican accusations against the military expenditure budget with concrete measures. According to informed sources, this is a meeting to reorganize and unify the Army and Navy.</p>
<p>[French News Agency, Washington, 14th] Republican Congressman Cole told the press today that the US Army and Navy budget for the fiscal year beginning in July 1947 will be reduced by 20 to 37 percent. Navy Secretary Forrest intends to reduce the Navy budget from 5 billion US dollars to 4 billion US dollars, and the Army budget will also be reduced from 8 billion US dollars to 5 or 6 billion US dollars.</p>
<p>[French News Agency, Washington, 13th] Republican Senator Knutson said that the Republican Party may revise the defense budget and is currently considering reducing the budget of the Army and Navy by 300 million US dollars. The Republicans believe that the current weapons of war have become obsolete due to the development of the last war, and the main military expenditure in the future will be for experimental research. The strength of the Army and Navy may be reduced, and focus will be placed on atomic armaments and other secret weapons. The Army and Navy are currently keeping silent on this matter.</p>
<h3 id="e66">American Fleet Will Sail to Antarctica Next Month Engage in Cold-Weather Combat Training The Soviet Union Also Declares It Will Conduct Exercises There <a href="#e66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 13th] The United States, knowing that its military exercises in the Arctic region have caused unease in the Soviet Union, has turned to the other end of the earth to conduct cold-weather experiments with warships and aircraft. The Navy Department announced today that it will send a fleet to exercise in the Antarctic to prepare for the US Navy to fight in cold climates in the future. The United States chose Antarctica as the training location for two reasons: one is to alleviate the Soviet Union's concerns about exercises near its territory, and the other is that the remote location of the exercises can ensure the secrecy of the exercises to a considerable extent. The Antarctic exercises will be technically guided by the famous Antarctic explorer Byrd. It is said that the Soviet Union has also announced that it will conduct exercises in Antarctica, but the details are unknown. In addition, a British expedition also arrived in Antarctica two years ago, and some personnel may still be staying there. The British base there is about 1,500 miles from the future base of the US expedition to the Ross Sea. That ground faces New Zealand. Byrd's expedition to Antarctica eight years ago was stationed here. Although he briefly mentioned the question of whether the American expedition would find materials for uranium energy and atomic bombs, he said that this expedition should not be regarded as a uranium competition. The American expedition will have a total of 4,000 people, including about 300 pure scientists, including 25 civilian scientists. According to the Navy authorities, no nuclear physicists are accompanying them. Establishing a permanent or semi-permanent base in Antarctica can accommodate the experiments of flying arrows, which are both safe and secret. Byrd's group is scheduled to board 13 ships early next month, with the Olympus Mountain as the flagship. The aircraft will be carried by the aircraft carrier Philippine Sea, and the submarine fleet will conduct sea measurements.</p>

<p>Plans to Assist China in Establishing a Strong Navy</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 13th, United Press] The United States plans to use the former Japanese mandated islands to supplement Guam, Pearl Harbor, the Aleutian Islands, and Alaska as strong defensive locations. Among the Marshall, Caroline, and Mariana Islands, only Saipan and Tinian are strategically important in peacetime. After a 28,000-mile journey through the Pacific and China with US military leaders, a United Press reporter stated that, for the long-term defense of the United States, all islands other than the aforementioned islands have been relegated to secondary positions and do not need to be urgently expanded immediately. The Guam base is the most important, so it is planned to be completed first in 1951, making it a base that can supply any American fleet in the Pacific. Army and Navy leaders all believe that the United States must establish a strong base on the large Ryukyu Islands in order to complete the "stabilizing force" in Northeast Asia and the Western Pacific region. The United States does not have a permanent naval base in China, but it will assist the Chinese government in establishing the Qingdao Naval Academy and training 110 Chinese naval officers and 1,100 sailors. The American side believes that a strong Chinese navy can allow the United States to withdraw many warships currently deployed in the Pacific.</p>

Gandhi followed the dog to a certain location, where he saw a pile of charred bones. The villagers told him that this pile of charred bones was the dog's owner. Gandhi was deeply moved by this situation.</p>

<p>[United Press, Cairo, 13th] Thousands of members of the Egyptian Nationalist Party marched in a procession to the Royal Palace today, shouting "Revolution, Revolution," demanding the resignation of the Sadat Cabinet, resulting in two fierce clashes with hundreds of police officers. Twelve party members and five police officers were seriously injured, and many were slightly injured. After the clashes, the police attempted to break into the Nationalist Party Club three times. The two sides finally ceased hostilities, the police retreated, and the demonstrators dispersed in the same way. The British military authorities, upon hearing the news, prohibited soldiers from entering the city. Earlier, about 8,000 Nationalist Party members met at the club and demanded "the withdrawal of British troops from Egypt, the resignation of Prime Minister Sadat, and the complete incorporation of the Nile River basin into Egyptian territory." Party leader Nahas declared that Sadat was a dictator and that Britain intended to use Egypt as a tool, not only to rule Egypt but also to rule the entire Middle East.</p>

<p>[French News Agency, London, 13th] The Standard Evening News recently reported that Prime Minister Attlee announced that 69 Labor Party members recently jointly submitted a motion criticizing the government's foreign policy, and if they do not automatically withdraw it, they will be in danger of being expelled from Parliament. Among these 69 members, 54 had jointly submitted a motion to amend the current foreign policy, advocating a policy that opposes American capitalism and Soviet communism at the same time. The remaining 15 had jointly submitted a motion opposing the implementation of mandatory military service. For this reason, Prime Minister Attlee proposed to prohibit Labor Party members from proposing any motions opposing the government's policies. Unexpectedly, 200 Labor Party members expressed their approval of the Prime Minister's motion. The British Labor Party has faced its most serious crisis since coming to power in July 1945, and this can be seen from this.</p>

<p>Prosecutors Say It Is Extremely Important to the Entire Case</p>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 14th] At the opening of the International Military Tribunal for the Far East today, the prosecution announced that a copy of a telegram from the former Foreign Minister Togo to the former Ambassador to the United States Nomura, which was found in the Japanese Foreign Ministry archives, was discovered to have been deleted. The telegram was sent on November 30, 1941, four days after the Japanese fleet entered the Pacific in preparation for attacking Pearl Harbor, instructing Nomura to make another verbal negotiation to make the United States accept Japanese demands. One of the most important paragraphs in the original telegram stated: "In carrying out this order, please be cautious and do not cause anything that would cause the negotiations to break down." At that time, the telegram was intercepted by American intelligence personnel and made public during the Pearl Harbor Incident investigation. The original manuscript obtained by the International Tribunal from the Japanese Foreign Ministry archives did not contain this paragraph. Deputy Prosecutor Feichli asked the court to pay attention to the importance of the deleted part and said: "We currently have no evidence to prove who made the deletion, but an investigation is underway. Presiding Judge Webb ordered him to continue the investigation, saying that he was dealing with one of the most important documents in the entire case." The prosecution accused the defendants of attempting to prolong the Washington negotiations in order to cover up their military preparations for attacking Pearl Harbor and Singapore, so the deleted telegram is extremely important to the basis of the prosecution.</p>

<p>[French News Agency, New York, 13th] Director of the State Department's Economic Bureau Clayton delivered a speech at the National Foreign Trade Convention today, stating that the goal of American foreign economic policy is to expand the world economy in order to lay the foundation for peace. To implement this policy, we must increase the production, distribution, and consumption of goods throughout the world, so that people of all countries in the world can have ample food and clothing and live and work in peace and contentment. To achieve this goal, the American government signed the Sino-American Treaty of Commerce with China on the 4th of this month, and the American government is now formulating a plan to negotiate similar treaties with other governments. Although our foreign economic policy cannot claim to be purely altruistic, there is nothing wrong with protecting our own interests on the one hand and taking into account the rights and interests of other countries on the other hand. In fact, these two must complement each other in any case.</p>
<h3 id="e79">Japan Reparations Conference to Open at Month's End; Pauley's Final Report; Remaining Ships to Be Considered When Drafting Peace Treaty <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>[United Press International, Washington, 13th] Edwin Pauley, Special Envoy for Japanese Reparations Issues, today submitted his final report to President Truman, supplementing the preliminary report submitted in the spring. It provides a detailed estimate of Japanese assets available for reparations to the Allied nations. A copy of this final report has also been sent to the State Department and will then be submitted to the Far Eastern Commission as a blueprint for discussions to begin at the end of this month or early next month. China, Britain, Australia, the Netherlands, France, India, the Philippines, and New Zealand have all agreed to participate in the conference, but the Soviet Union remains a question mark. The contents of Pauley's report are currently being kept strictly confidential, but it is understood that not only various military factories and auxiliary military factories but also consumer goods factories are included for allocation as reparations. The United States and Canada have not, at least as of now, made any claims regarding preliminary reparations allocations. The Soviet Union, however, continues to show indifference to the Far Eastern Commission and the United States' separate efforts to resolve the Japanese reparations issue, and is therefore also unlikely to make any claims.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 13th, United Press] A member of the Far Eastern Commission told a United Press reporter that the issue of Japanese commercial ships rebuilding Japan's overseas trade will be one of the last issues considered when drafting the peace treaty. Before the Allied nations engage in any discussion of this issue, they will first determine their reparations claims against Japan, and only then will they consider the use of the remaining Japanese ships, and their final disposition, to help Japan's economic recovery and enable Japan to participate in the trade activities of other maritime nations.</p>

This "driveable and flyable" vehicle, named the "Airphibian," has been successfully tested both on land and in the air. It can fly at 120 miles per hour in the air, and its speed on the ground is virtually unlimited. However, Fulton says that it is best not to exceed 45 miles per hour.</p>

<h3 id="e85">Deadline for Reporting Losses Suffered by the People During the War Extended by One Month; Regulations for Victims to Report Based on Value at Time of Loss; Compensation to Be Converted into Pre-War U.S. Dollars <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>During the first session of the City Council, a proposal was made: "Negotiate for compensation for losses during the war, provide full relief to the affected people, alleviate public hardship, and comfort public expectations." After a public vote, the proposal was forwarded by the City Government to the Central Government for consideration. The City Government submitted the proposal to the Central Government a month ago. Yesterday, the Executive Yuan's Compensation Committee replied: "The investigation and reporting of people's losses may have omissions. The investigation and reporting period may be extended for one month from the date of this document. However, attention must be paid to preventing false reports. The value of losses reported should be based on the value at the time of the loss. This Committee has made this stipulation to calculate the true value of the loss suffered by the reporter. In the future, when demanding compensation from Japan, the value at the time of the loss will be converted into the U.S. dollar value of July 1947. This type of calculation standard is more convenient." It is understood that, for the sake of accuracy and convenience, the City Government will issue a notice to all districts to assist with registration and investigation. Fearing that citizens may not understand the procedures, it has specially prepared forms, including the Property Loss Report Form, the Direct Property Loss Report Form for Industrial Companies, Firms, and Factories, the Direct Property Loss Report Form for Commercial Companies and Firms, and the Shanghai Population Injury and Death Investigation Form. It is necessary to fill in the name, address, date of loss, lost materials, and value. Sufficient documents should be prepared for review. Report promptly within one month for submission to the Central Government to demand compensation from Japan.</p>
<p>[Another Report] The City Council previously proposed that the Central Government allocate a portion of Japanese reparations and enemy-puppet assets to handle the city's construction projects. However, according to the Executive Yuan's Compensation Committee's reply: "How to compel Japan to pay compensation is currently being planned. As for how the compensation materials will be allocated and distributed in the future, it will be handled by the relevant Central Government departments after jointly formulating a plan."</p>

<p>[United Press, Washington, 13th] The State Department today announced that, according to a notice from the Shanghai Municipal Government, American nationals in Shanghai who have suffered loss of life or property from December 8, 1941, to the end of the war are requested to register with the Municipal Government for compensation claims. This includes deaths, injuries, property losses, and losses due to increased business expenses and reduced profits. The amount of compensation requested must be calculated in legal tender. The State Department also announced that this action by the Shanghai Municipal Government does not affect the U.S. authorities' future compensation claims. Furthermore, this action by the Shanghai Municipal Government is simply because the Nanjing government wants to know the estimated losses of American nationals and does not imply immediate payment. Other municipal governments outside of Shanghai are also handling the matter in the same way. Payment of compensation is likely to occur after the signing of a peace treaty with Japan.</p>

<p>Also, at 4:00 p.m., Chinese and foreign relief organizations will hold a tea party at the American Community Church as a friendly gathering. It is understood that Sir Stafford Cripps' family are all vegetarians and usually like to eat fresh vegetables and abstain from meat. The whole family follows this rule for decades, so the banquet for the distinguished guest will mainly be vegetarian. Tomorrow morning, Lady Cripps and her entourage will visit the Military Medical Office in Jiangwan. In the afternoon, the Shanghai Women's Federation will host a tea party. In the evening, the manager and his wife of the British Swire Group will host a dinner at their private residence on Hongqiao Road, and Lady Cripps will also accept their invitation to spend a quiet early winter weekend in Hongqiao, away from the city. Next Monday, Consul Ogden and his wife will hold an evening party to welcome Lady Cripps and her company, who will also leave Shanghai for Nanjing next Wednesday to say goodbye to Chairman Chiang and his wife. On the 23rd, they will leave Nanjing and fly to Guangzhou, and then return to England from Guangzhou via Hong Kong, completing this long trip to China.</p>

<p>Banking Society Practical Meeting</p>
<p>The Banking Society held a practical meeting yesterday. Attendees included representatives from the Four Banks and Two Bureaus, the silver industry, and trust companies. Several important cases were discussed: (1) Unifying the sample seals of the industry, all signed in Chinese, with signing staff divided into levels A and B. (2) Suggesting fixed-term loans to supplement the application of commercial promissory notes. This case aims to improve the current loan methods and ban the practice of check discounting. It is currently under further study by the Society. It is said that it has three advantages: (A) Account receivables become negotiable receivables, which are easier to recover and can be endorsed for transfer. (B) It can avoid customers' excuses for shadow accounts. (C) It can curb the practice of issuing checks indiscriminately, and bounced checks can be reduced.</p>

<p>[Our Reporter] The three ships that the China Merchants Bureau purchased in Canada, the "Zizhong," "Dengyu," and "Lingge," have been received. The "Zizhong" ship has already been received. The "Dengyu" ship is currently unloading cargo in the capital. The "Lingge" ship also arrived in Shanghai yesterday, entering the port at 11:10 a.m. and departing again at 4:15 p.m. The main reason is that there is no place to berth in the port, so it is temporarily anchored outside the port. It is also reported that the Bureau previously selected surplus American ships in the Philippines. They have now been coming to Shanghai in succession. Tugboats Nos. 106 and 108 came to Shanghai some days ago. They are now ordered to go to the Philippines to tow iron barges to Shanghai, which are expected to arrive within this month. It is said that there are more than a hundred ships selected in the Philippines, mostly iron barges, tugboats, and docks.</p>

<p>Since the Central Trust Bureau's second public sale of 39 units of enemy-puppet properties began registration, more than half a month has passed. As of yesterday, only more than 20 units have been applied for. For various alleyway houses with leasing disputes, except for one or two alleyways in the Hongkou District where applications have been registered, no one has applied for other alleyways such as the Weihai Villas. This is because no one wants to create unnecessary trouble for themselves. It is understood that the deadline for the second public sale registration may be on the 20th of this month. Because of the original tenants' efforts to fight for their rights, those who want to buy have been deterred, resulting in the fact that the alleyways will not be sold in the second public sale. They are able to continue living there for now and will not be in a panic.</p>
<h3 id="e94">Housing for Public School Teachers; 1,000 Buildings to Be Built in Both Nanjing and Shanghai; Three Banks and Two Bureaus to Form a Loan Syndicate <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>In order to help the government solve the housing problem for public school teachers and promote urban construction, the Central Trust Bureau is currently discussing with the China Bank, the Bank of Communications, the Farmers Bank of China, and the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau to jointly form a "Housing Loan Syndicate for Public School Teachers' Housing Sales." The plan is to first build 1,000 houses for public school teachers in Nanjing and Shanghai to alleviate the housing shortage in both places. The initial agreement and the regulations of the Syndicate's Management Committee have been drafted by the Central Trust Bureau and are awaiting consultation with the various banks and bureaus. Once decided, the loan syndicate can be established, and it is hoped that commercial banks can also participate in the cooperation. According to a responsible person from the Central Trust Bureau to a reporter from the Central News Agency: "The housing loan syndicate is expected to be established next month, and construction can also begin in the spring of next year. Pre-orders will be publicly registered in Nanjing and Shanghai. The residential houses and the land will be sold separately, but the purchasers are limited to public school teachers from government agencies. The houses in Shanghai will be built on vacant land belonging to enemy-puppet properties in the Hongkou, Zhabei, Nanshi, and downtown areas. The Central Trust Bureau has also surveyed a portion of the vacant land belonging to enemy-puppet properties in this city and submitted it to the Executive Yuan for approval. It will be purchased for the construction of public school teachers' housing. The cost of housing is divided into five categories. The highest, Grade A, is estimated to cost 40 million yuan including the land. Grade B is 35 million yuan, Grade C is 30 million yuan, Grade D is 20 million yuan, and Grade E is a small house with one floor above and one floor below, costing 10 million yuan. According to the plan proposed by the Central Trust Bureau, the total price of the first phase of construction in Nanjing and Shanghai is limited to 20 billion yuan. Those who make reservations must first pay a deposit of 30% of the total purchase price. The remaining 70% will be paid in equal monthly installments over twelve months from the date of delivery, with a monthly interest rate of 2.5%. Therefore, during the construction period, in addition to pre-collecting 30% of the construction cost from the reservationists, the syndicate must provide loans of approximately 14 billion yuan. If the purchasers need to change the Central Trust Bureau's regulations or add additional installations to the style of the building, they can temporarily apply to the Bureau for approval, and the additional costs will be borne by the purchasers."</p>

Chen Xiwu, a plainclothes police officer from the Tilanqiao Police Station, learned about the matter and suspected something was amiss. He secretly reported it to Branch Director Zhang the day before yesterday, who immediately ordered Section Chief Ma Zhuyu to send police officers to conduct a strict investigation. It was discovered that the tin foil was purchased from Fuyuan Shen Tin Foil Store in Wuxi and transported by Daxin Company. Because the company did not have enough goods to fill a car, it entrusted the transfer to the Meta Trading and Transportation Company (located in Room 103, Shenzhou Hotel, Zhejiang Road). However, Zhang Jigen, the person in charge of the company, was not good at operating the company and suffered huge losses. He colluded with Cai Ping of Shenxin No. 7 Factory to set up a scam. He had the 40 pieces of tin foil unloaded from the truck and hired streetcars to transport them to Zhang Xiaomei's home for hiding, falsely claiming that they were repayment from a friend. Zhang Jigen went to other places to sell them. Later, Daxin Transportation Company received a telegram from Fuyuan Shen in Wuxi saying that the goods had not arrived. It became suspicious and urgently inquired with Meta about the details, but it was not known where the goods had gone. Now, Cai Ping and the tin foil have been seized by the Tilanqiao Branch.</p>
<h3 id="e96">German Suspected War Criminals Continued to Be Tried Yesterday; Japanese Liaison Officer Takashima Testified; Ohlhaver Smiled Bitterly Frequently; Shen Ke and Others' Request for Release Was Not Approved <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>[Our Reporter] The American Military Tribunal continued to try the remaining 21 German suspected war criminals, including Ohlhaver, at 8:00 a.m. yesterday, after six people including Shen Ke were acquitted the day before yesterday.</p>
<p>After the court session began, Lawyer Yao Zhaodi, Shen Ke's defense lawyer, argued that Shen Ke had already been acquitted and should not be detained any longer. He stood up and asked the court to release him immediately. The defense lawyers for the rest of the defendants, including Gerisch, Otto, Hormann, Stohrer, and Randow, also made the same request one after another. Presiding Judge Colonel Myron and others announced that they would adjourn the court for deliberation. After fifteen minutes, the court reconvened, but the lawyers' request was not granted.</p>
<p>Throughout the morning, Takashima, the former Japanese military liaison officer with the Ohlhaver Bureau in Shanghai, testified. Takashima testified that the Japanese military had a relationship with the Ohlhaver Bureau since March 1943. The Bureau provided information on the international situation and military affairs and intercepted United Nations telegrams. After the news of Germany's surrender in August 1945, the Japanese military authorities ordered Ohlhaver to dissolve its organization. The Japanese military took over all the Bureau's assets, and the personnel in the Bureau were free to continue serving the Japanese side or not. Takashima recalled the situation when he accompanied his superior to meet with Ohlhaver at that time vividly. Ohlhaver, who was listening attentively on the defendant's bench, smiled bitterly frequently upon hearing this. Takashima also said that the Japanese side gave the Ohlhaver Bureau 130 million yuan in counterfeit money as dissolution fees.</p>

When he reached Hankou Road and the Bund, he found that the money and checks were missing. Lin suddenly had a fanciful idea. He took a car to the Huangpu Branch and falsely reported that the money and checks had been stolen by a armed attacker. After investigation, it was found that there was no such thing. When Lin was interrogated strictly, he finally told the truth. Branch Director Du ordered him to be detained overnight as a warning.</p>

<p>Recently, regarding the High Procuratorate's summons of film and drama personnel suspected of collaborating with the enemy, there has been much speculation.

After discussion, the meeting decided to issue the following statement: (1) The Association previously conducted public opinion surveys and consulted legal experts to investigate film and drama personnel suspected of collaborating with the enemy. After thorough research, it was decided to issue moral condemnations against these individuals. The list of individuals summoned by the High Procuratorate, as reported by several newspapers in this city, was mistakenly reported to have been made by the Association, and a statement should be issued to clarify responsibility. (2) The Association believes that this issue should be handled with clarity, recognizing the severity and importance of the matter, and with speed and caution. It hopes that national law enforcement agencies will prioritize the future of the entire film and drama industry and avoid negatively impacting the burgeoning revival of domestic film production.</p>

<p>[Our Dispatch] The Inspection Department of the Songhu Garrison Headquarters recently apprehended Li Chunzhen (age 35), a Chinese expatriate who had studied in Japan, in a nightclub in Hongkou for impersonating the Chief of Military Law of the department. The suspect had previously, in the middle of last month, using the aforementioned title, defrauded over 300 Japanese expatriates who had evacuated from Beijing to Shanghai of five million legal tender. At the time, their luggage exceeded the regulations of our authorities, and fearing confiscation, they privately hired civilian ships to smuggle the excess luggage to Shanghai in advance. The Garrison Headquarters learned of this and detained the ship upon arrival. The suspect then claimed to be the Chief of Military Law of the Garrison Headquarters and contacted Noshita, the representative of the Japanese expatriates, stating that if five million yuan was given as lobbying expenses, it could be returned within ten days. After the payment was made, there was no further news. Noshita then inquired with the Garrison Headquarters and realized that he had been deceived. Unexpectedly, earlier this month, the suspect, again using the same title, defrauded Kuwahara, another Japanese expatriate, of a cotton cloth warehouse receipt stored at the Jin City Bank. He then altered the name on the receipt and sold it for twenty million yuan. After being arrested, Li Chunzhen confessed to the aforementioned crimes. The Inspection Department has now transferred him to the Military Law Department for legal proceedings.</p>

To guide passengers to obey order, the authorities have dispatched three military police officers to the terminal stations of Tilanqiao, Yangjingbang, and Jing'an Temple, starting yesterday. They are stationed there throughout the day to advise passengers to line up and board the tram in an orderly manner. Even military and police personnel are not exempt. The military police strictly enforce the rules, and those who take "return trams" in order to secure a seat are also ordered to disembark and join the back of the line. Therefore, at the end of the workday yesterday, the lines at Yangjingbang were quite orderly.</p>

<p>[Special Report from Our Newspaper] Leprosy... The mere mention of this name conjures up a terrifying image: swollen faces, enlarged ears, no eyebrows. Another type of neurological leprosy patient... Leprosy is the most dreadful of all diseases. It disfigures patients and subjects them to social rejection and contempt. The physical suffering is endless, and the mental persecution is even more relentless.</p>
<p>Christianity is the only religion in the world that shows compassion for leprosy patients. The story of Jesus healing lepers is well known. The "China Leprosy Relief Association" is dedicated to eradicating leprosy based on Christian humanitarian principles.</p>
<p>Across China, there are nearly one million leprosy patients, with the highest concentrations in the southern and southwestern provinces. This may be due to the hot climate and unsanitary living conditions. According to reliable estimates, there are approximately three thousand leprosy patients scattered among Shanghai's four million residents. Among them are beggars, vendors, department store employees, master chefs, street performers, and shoestore owners. Therefore, we are constantly at risk of coming into contact with leprosy patients. This is extremely dangerous.</p>
<p>Some European and American countries have leprosy laws, and the police have the authority to arrest leprosy patients and send them to leprosy asylums for compulsory treatment because these individuals pose a threat to public safety. However, this is not the case in China, where leprosy patients have complete freedom and are not subject to any interference.</p>
<p>Leprosy is now a curable disease, but first, it is necessary to isolate patients from society for public safety. Therefore, the China Leprosy Relief Association has two main goals: to provide relief to leprosy patients and to protect public safety.</p>
<p>The "China Leprosy Relief Association" was established in 1926. It has established leprosy hospitals in Hainan Island, Hunan, Guangdong, and Jiangxi to provide scientific treatment to patients. In various parts of South China, due to public prejudice, many leprosy hospitals are like prisons, treating patients worse than animals. There have even been cases of leprosy patients being shot.</p>
<p>As for the Shanghai branch of the China Leprosy Relief Association, it purchased one hundred acres of land in Dachang in 1935 and built seventeen houses, becoming the largest leprosy asylum in the country. Unfortunately, after the outbreak of war, the association's headquarters were destroyed by enemy forces and are no longer usable. It is now restricted to a corner of Bailinan Road.</p>
<p>Seventh Fundraising Campaign to Open Today</p>
<p>To actively promote leprosy relief work, the association has launched its seventh fundraising campaign, with Mayor Wu serving as the honorary director-general. The opening ceremony is scheduled for 4:00 PM today at the Kangle Restaurant.</p>
<p>According to the association's director-general, Du Zhijian, who spoke to reporters, it will cost 200 million yuan to repair the buildings in Dachang and 100 million yuan to replenish various facilities, totaling 300 million yuan. One hundred million yuan has already been secured, and the target for this fundraising campaign is 200 million yuan in national currency.</p>
<p>Citizens of Shanghai, for the sake of those suffering leprosy patients and for the safety of society, please donate generously.</p>

<h3 id="e108">Pre-Pacific War Installment Savings Account, 800-Fold Repayment Case; Juxingcheng Bank Appeals in Disagreement <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>The High Court Encourages Both Parties to Attempt Reconciliation; Expresses Reluctance to Set a Precedent</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The issue of repaying pre-war debts has recently attracted great public attention and has repeatedly led to disputes. Yesterday, the Fifth Civil Division of the High Court heard another appeal case concerning a five-year installment savings account at Juxingcheng Bank, where the lower court ruled that repayment should be calculated at 800 times the original amount. The plaintiffs, Luo Youyuan and the Lu Kun brothers, deposited special installment savings with Juxingcheng Bank on September 28, 1938, and December 14, 1938, respectively, with a term of five years, both expiring in May 1942. Lu Yu's account had a balance of 2,311.43 yuan, and Lu Kun's account had a balance of 2,185.03 yuan. The Lu brothers engaged a lawyer on June 28 of this year to inquire with Juxingcheng Bank, but received no response. They then filed a lawsuit in the lower court in August, requesting repayment at 1,000 times the original amount. The lower court concluded in mid-September, ruling that the depreciation of currency and the increase in the cost of living were well-known facts. If debtors were to repay previous deposits at the original amount, it would be unfair, and it was reasonable and legal for creditors to request increased payment. However, the total deposits were made in installments, with 40% deposited in 1941 and 1942. Therefore, the court considered the circumstances of both parties and determined that repayment should be calculated at 800 times the original amount, awarding Lu Yu 1,849,144 legal tender and Lu Kun 1,748,024 legal tender, both with monthly interest of 9% from the date of filing the lawsuit until the date of execution. The remainder of the plaintiffs' claims was dismissed, and the defendant was responsible for the litigation costs.</p>
<p>After receiving the lower court's judgment on September 19, the defendant, Juxingcheng Bank, argued that installment savings accounts differed from other fixed-term deposits. Banks conducting savings business are subject to strict restrictions on capital utilization under the Savings Bank Law. They are required to deposit one-quarter of the total amount as government bonds in a special vault established by the Central Bank as collateral for repaying savings deposits. Other methods of utilization are limited to low-profit, high-security policies. During the Anti-Japanese War, Shanghai was occupied by the enemy and puppet regime, and the bank's investment and utilization scope became even more restricted, incomparable to those engaging in profiteering. Therefore, it could not bear the 800-fold amount and immediately appealed to the High Court. The hearing took place at 3:00 PM yesterday. The appellant, Juxingcheng Bank's attorney Yao Zhaodi, and the appellee's attorney, Wang Boxian, were both present. After Judge Cheng Ruikun questioned the case, he encouraged both parties to attempt reconciliation, stating that the court was unwilling to set a precedent. If reconciliation failed, the court would collect relevant information and make a decision after careful consideration. He also hoped that both parties would collect statistical materials to assist the court's judgment. The case was adjourned for further hearing.</p>
<h3 id="e109">Another Savings Deposit Case; 1,000-Fold Repayment; Also Undecided <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>Furthermore, Chen Jilin, a citizen, deposited 2,000 legal tender with the Four Banks Savings Association on May 6, 1940, for a five-year term. Upon maturity on May 6 of last year, Chen filed a lawsuit with the court, arguing that according to Article 12 of the Supplementary Regulations for Handling Civil Litigation After Recovery and Interpretation No. 3018 of the Judicial Yuan, he requested an increase in payment of 3,000 times the original amount. The lower court ruled that the defendant, the Four Banks Savings Association, should increase the payment by 1,000 times. However, the Four Banks Savings Association, because the Ministry of Finance had already repaid pre-war government bonds at their original value and the Central Savings Association was settling old savings deposits based on the original value, appealed to the High Court. Yesterday's hearing remained unresolved and was adjourned for further hearing.</p>
<h3 id="e110">Cold Front Approaches; Cold Weather to Continue Today and Tomorrow <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Yesterday, the weather in the city was even colder than the previous day, with overcast skies and biting winds, resembling the depths of winter. The highest temperature for the day was 57.6 degrees Fahrenheit, and the lowest was 48.8 degrees Fahrenheit. According to the Meteorological Observatory, this Siberian cold front has a pressure of 780 cm, so the cold air it contains is extremely strong. The cold front is divided into two streams. One is currently moving from North China towards Central and South China, with its outposts already extending to Taiwan. The other is moving from the northwest towards the southwest, so the entire country is under the influence of the cold front. The city will continue to experience cold weather today and tomorrow, with overcast skies, fog, and possibly light rain. After the cold front passes, the weather may become more stable. The report from the Shanghai Meteorological Observatory is recorded below:</p>
<p>The center of the Siberian anticyclone is in northwestern China, covering the entire country, the nine eastern provinces, Korea, and Japan. The tropical low pressure area is near Yap Island in the East Sea, Ryukyu Islands, and the northern South China Sea.</p>
<p>Weather forecast: Yellow Sea, cloudy and cold, strong northerly to northeasterly winds, high waves.</p>
<p>Central China, cloudy, localized rain or fog, light haze, brisk northerly to northeasterly winds.</p>

<h3 id="e112">Yuan Ludeng Case Remanded for Retrial; Claims He Acted Solely According to His Conscience; Over 3,000 Businesses Jointly Provide Testimonials; Six Witnesses All Claim to Have Been Rescued by the Defendant <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The Yuan Ludeng case, involving charges of treason, was previously sentenced to life imprisonment by the Shanghai High Court on May 31. The defendant disagreed with the verdict and appealed to the Supreme Court for a retrial. The Supreme Court ruled that the original trial did not fully investigate evidence favorable to the defendant and hastily sentenced him, which was inappropriate. Therefore, it was remanded for retrial. The High Court originally scheduled a hearing for this morning, but it was postponed to 2:30 PM due to unforeseen circumstances. The questioning concluded at 4:15 PM. Because further investigation of evidence was required, the case was adjourned for further hearing, and the defendant was returned to custody.</p>
<p>The case was presided over yesterday by Judge Qiu Huanrong, assisted by Clerk Tang Quan. The questioning focused on the defendant's role as Chairman of the Preparatory Committee for the Puppet Shanghai Baobao (Neighborhood) Self-Government and Chairman of the Puppet Rice Control Association. Yuan, dressed in a blue gown, black socks, and black shoes, with black tortoiseshell-rimmed glasses, testified that on February 14, 1942, bomb incidents occurred in six districts of the city, and all districts were sealed off. At the time, the defendant served as a Chinese Director of the Shanghai Municipal Council and used his position in the business community to mediate. The Japanese side made his appointment as Chairman of the Baojia Committee a condition for lifting the blockade. At the time, he thought that it could not be wrong to save people, so he stepped forward. He handled the matter for less than three months and then handed it over to the police bureau. His appointment as Chairman of the Puppet Rice Control Association was also to maintain Shanghai's food supply and distribute rice based on household registrations. In May 1944, the household rice ration was interrupted, and on May 28, he claimed illness and entered the Hongqiao Sanatorium to resign. Only after his resignation was approved did he leave the hospital, he said. The court then questioned the defendant about his pro-enemy statements published in the Puppet New China Daily and other publications. Yuan denied all of them. He also said, "I still have integrity. I will never deny what I have said." He also said, "I was once kidnapped to Hongkou by the Japanese. If they had killed me then, I would have become famous. I have no political ideology, and I don't understand the law. I am a Christian, and all my motives are to save people and seek fairness. Ask He Dehui, he knows everything about my actions in Shanghai and even my private life."</p>
<p>Yu Bingjian and Others Testify</p>
<p>The court then proceeded to question the witnesses presented by the defendant. Huang Hanyuan, former special commissioner of the Relief Committee for Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, Yu Bingjian, current director of the Shanghai Telecommunications Bureau of the Ministry of Communications, Mao Geyuan, former member of the Central Relief Committee, Shao Xiushan, a match merchant, Zheng Wuchang, a painter, and Wu Jingbo, a teacher, all testified that they had been arrested by the enemy military police and rescued by the defendant. The defendant's defense attorney, Jiang Yiping, then presented Yuan's record book of entering the Hongqiao Sanatorium in May 1944 to resign as Chairman of the Puppet Rice Control Association (because the government had issued an order to reduce the sentences of those who had left their puppet positions before June 1944). He also presented abstracts of over 2,000 official letters from the Puppet Rice Control Association and a certificate signed jointly by over 3,000 businesses in the city on behalf of the defendant, requesting the court to consider the environment in Shanghai at the time and the defendant's motives for participating in the Puppet Baojia Association and the Puppet Rice Control Association. Attorney Jiang requested that the presiding judge randomly select one or two of these thousands of businesses, all of whom could testify on behalf of the defendant. Attorney Jiang also requested that the court summon Wen Lantao, Lin Kanghou, Tang Shoumin, Chen Guoquan, and Zhou Chunyu, who were in custody, to investigate the situation of the Puppet Rice Control Association.</p>
<p>Request to Extend the Trial Period</p>
<p>He also stated: Tang Shoumin was first sentenced to life imprisonment, followed by Yuan Ludeng also being sentenced to life imprisonment. Then Li Ze was sentenced to three years, Lin Kanghou was sentenced to six years, and Wen Lantao was sentenced to eight years. These five cases are interconnected and have a causal relationship. Because the presiding judge had sentenced one case in that way, he seemed compelled to do the same for the subsequent cases. Therefore, he was subject to many restrictions. This retrial of the Yuan case is to seek the spirit of the rule of law and uphold justice. He requested that the court extend the trial period so that the other cases could be remanded for retrial and judged at the same time, in order to avoid being constrained. On the other hand, the defense team could also have ample time to collect evidence. The court only replied that it would give them time to collect favorable evidence. It then asked the defendant if he had anything to say. Yuan replied: "In my life, I would rather harm myself to benefit others and suffer myself to save others. Please understand this point." At this point, the court adjourned the hearing and adjourned. The defendant briefly spoke with his family members before being returned to Zhonghe.</p>
<p>The Supreme Court's retrial decision for the Yuan case is recorded below:</p>
<p>Supreme Court Retrial Decision</p>
<p>Original text of the Supreme Court retrial decision: "In this case, the original judgment held that the defendant was the General Manager of Ning Shao Shipping Company and had served as a Chinese Director of the former Shanghai Municipal Council for many years. After Shanghai fell, he continued to serve as a Chinese Director and Chairman of the Shanghai Puppet City Chamber of Commerce. In September 1943, the Puppet Nanjing Government's Executive Yuan and the enemy jointly organized the Rice Control Association, with the defendant serving as Chairman and as a member of the Nanjing Puppet Price Control Review Committee, purchasing military rice for the enemy and supplying military needs, until he resigned at the end of June 1944. In February 1942, the Public Concession was bombed by patriots, causing unrest among the enemy. The Concession Center District was divided into six districts and sealed off. The defendant used enemy puppet power to organize Baojia (Neighborhood Watch), serving as Chairman of the Preparatory Committee, clearing household registrations by the Puppet Police Department in two days, hoping to exclude patriotic elements. He also served as a member of the Puppet New National Sports Association, etc. After a thorough review of the entire case by this court, the Rice Control Association was composed of both Chinese and Japanese members. The rice ration was aimed at Chinese and Japanese military rice. There are Shangtong Association publications and the defendant's admission that the association had five Japanese members, six Chinese members, and two deputy chairmen, one being Chen Guoquan and the other being the Japanese representative Zhi Yuan Xian Cilang, which can be confirmed. After the defendant took office as Chairman of the Association, his daily statements stated, "At present, the Greater East Asia War is developing vigorously. Sufficient food and soldiers are important conditions for establishing and protecting the country, and it is closely related to the survival and honor of the future of Greater East Asia. This Association is entrusted by the 'Central Government' and is supported by the people of the whole country, and is responsible for maintaining the people's food supply," as evidenced by the defendant's speeches in many places published in the New China Daily and the Puppet Shenbao. His appointment as Chairman of the Puppet Baojia Preparatory Committee was due to the bombing incident in the Public Concession, which was ordered by the enemy to resolve it. However, if the original judgment has already determined that the defendant committed the above offenses, then his purchase of military rice for the enemy can be considered to be included in his concept of conspiring with the enemy to resist his own country, without the need to independently convict him. The original judgment held that the defendant should be convicted of Article 2, Paragraph 1, Item 1 of the Regulations on Punishing Traitors, as well as Article 5 and Article 3 of the same article, and that the lighter crime of conspiring with the enemy to purchase military rice should be announced in the main text, which is inappropriate. Moreover, the defendant made his best efforts to rescue patriotic elements from danger, and the witnesses were not summoned, etc., so it should be remanded for retrial."</p>
<h3 id="e113">Two Suspects in the Sun Tianchang Case Interrogated Yesterday <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>The Korean Sun Tianchangzhi was previously accused of manufacturing military firearms for the enemy. After investigation by the High Procuratorate, he has been transferred to a military court for trial on war crime charges. However, during the investigation of the Sun case, the High Procuratorate believed that Hu Chenggen, the foreman of the Precision Machinery Art Society opened by Sun Tianchangzhi, and Xu Tianxi, the accountant, had been entrusted by the enemy military department since the outbreak of the Pacific War to manage the main branch of the British-owned Motoli Qin Store and manufacture flamethrowers, bayonets, and repair artillery and small tanks for the enemy navy. Xu and Hu were both working with Sun. In 1941, Hu and Sun Tianchangzhi went to Nanzhou at the invitation of the Japanese military to estimate the repair costs of the munitions factory and military machinery for the enemy. Xu Tianxi was in charge of managing confidential matters for Sun Tianchangzhi, personally checking, receiving, and transporting all military supplies and manufactured goods sent by the military department. Therefore, these two individuals also had traitorous crimes. After being legally indicted, the High Court held a court investigation yesterday morning. The testimonies of the two were evasive and they tried to shift responsibility. As the case still requires investigation, it should be adjourned for further hearing.</p>

<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Wuer Taolehefu, the secretary of the White Russian Emigrant Association in this city, was accused of serving as an intelligence agent for the enemy's wireless station on Jing'an Temple Road. After a trial by the High Court, he was sentenced to two years and six months of imprisonment yesterday morning. Another defendant, Sun Renmao, a laborer accused of building roads for the enemy, was acquitted because his actions were deemed insufficient to constitute the crime of treason.</p>
<p>Zhang Yichang, 37 years old, from Fuzhou, had been doing business in Manila. He was accused of being ordered by the enemy in March of the 33rd year of the Republic (1944) to investigate sacks and automobile parts in Manila. In June of the same year, he became an intelligence agent for the enemy's naval intelligence department, spying on overseas Chinese information. He was issued credentials by the enemy's intelligence chief, Aoyama, and his monthly salary increased from 500 to 3,000 Philippine pesos. He also purchased scrap iron and privately sold cigarettes for the enemy army, repeatedly reaping substantial profits. He was repatriated to Shanghai by the Philippine government, where he was detained by the city's police bureau. The defendant testified in court yesterday that he was forced to go from Shanghai. However, he denied serving as an intelligence agent. The case is scheduled for sentencing on the morning of the 21st of this month. The case of Wu Yipeng, the secretary of the puppet Suzhou Maintenance Association, was also concluded yesterday and is scheduled for sentencing on the same day.</p>
<p>The case of Xue Jianqiu, a translator for the enemy's Mei Agency in Zhuji County, was heard in the second instance yesterday morning. In addition to serving as a translator for the Mei Agency, he was also accused of being the manager of the enemy's Southeast Company and establishing the Yongming Company on his own to search for and purchase timber, oil, and other items for the enemy. Under the pretext of losing Sugimoto, he led enemy and puppet troops to loot Gengniu properties in Shaojiang, Dalian, Changtai, Changhe, Changyi, and other villages, burned down more than ten houses, beat to death a rural woman named Shou Chen, and injured more than ten people, including Shou Yongsui. During the initial trial, the defendant admitted to serving as a translator for the enemy's Mei Agency, but claimed he participated on the orders of Bi Gaokui of the Military Statistics Bureau. He vehemently denied leading enemy and puppet troops to loot the villages. When the court session opened yesterday, the defendant's testimony remained similar to the above. Bi Gaokui, who was summoned to testify, did not arrive due to other commitments, providing a letter of attestation instead. The court ordered a postponement for further questioning.</p>

<p>Legal Questions</p>
<p>(1) Seeking Compromise</p>
<p>Tang Shuiming asks: A, currently fourteen years old, was betrothed to B at the age of nineteen by his parents. Although A himself did not agree, he did not object. However, a month before the engagement, B attempted suicide by poisoning, stating that it was because B was dissatisfied with the marriage. Subsequently, at the invitation of B's parents and B himself, A directly met with B and explained the process and motivation behind the suicide. It was then learned that B had another boyfriend with whom she had exchanged vows. She was about to be engaged to A, so she felt conflicted and resorted to this tactic. A sought to compromise and agreed to the engagement with B, and they later cohabited. However, the two's personalities were incompatible, and disagreements arose frequently. Now, there are several questions to ask for answers: (1) If A files for divorce from B solely on the grounds of emotional discord and mental damage, will it be valid? (2) As A is the initiator of the divorce but is not married, is there an obligation to pay B living expenses? (3) If B commits suicide after A files for divorce, will A have any legal responsibility?</p>
<p>[Answer by Lawyer Zhu Yakui] (1) Divorce should be based on the reasons listed in Article 1052 of the Civil Code, and cannot be based on vague emotional discord or mental damage. Since A and B are not married, their relationship can only be called cohabitation; (2) According to Article 1057 of the Civil Code, if one spouse is in financial difficulty due to divorce, the other party should provide appropriate alimony even if they are not at fault; (3) If there is no fact or action of threatening suicide, one should not be held responsible.</p>
<p>(2) Voluntary Divorce</p>
<p>Lu Yiyan asks: I work in the education field and have a good reputation in this area. I have a wife and daughter in my hometown. Because I am alone away from home, it is inconvenient, so over the years, I have repeatedly returned to my hometown to bring my family to Shanghai, but they have always refused. When asked why, there is no substantial reason, only stubbornness. Question: (1) According to legal regulations, is a woman obligated to live with her husband after she is married? (2) The two sides have not been in contact for several years and are currently at a standstill. Recently, friends from my hometown mentioned that the other party's behavior is quite frivolous. In order to protect the other party's future and my reputation, I must resolve this quickly. If both parties voluntarily divorce, am I obligated to be responsible for the other party's living expenses? (3) Will my remarriage after the divorce conflict with the law?</p>
<p>[Lawyer Zhu Yakui] (1) Husband and wife naturally have the obligation to live together; (2) If both husband and wife are willing to divorce, they may stipulate the conditions of the divorce themselves. (3) Remarriage is possible and does not conflict with the law.</p>

<h3 id="e120">Cooking Oil Continues to Rise: Influenced by Visiting Merchants; Distribution is Expected to Get Back on Track After Implementation; Social Affairs Bureau Orders Merchants to Sell Quickly <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The oil market continued to rise yesterday. Our reporter visited Mayor Wu to inquire about future policies for cooking oil in the city. He said: Starting next week, the city will regularly have 36,000 dan of cooking oil per month, allocated to various cooking oil retail stores for sale at a negotiated price. The Chinese Cooking Oil Company and the Chinese Vegetable Oil Factory will each be responsible for 10,000 dan. The remaining 16,000 dan will be borne by nine privately-run oil mills. (However, before the private factories return to normal production, they will initially bear 12,000 dan. Efforts will continue to increase production of the remaining 4,000 dan.) The fluctuations in cooking oil prices this week are purely caused by Shanghai merchants from other areas who are inflating the prices of oil from those areas. The cost of oil from other areas is higher, so the asking price is higher than the negotiated price for locally-produced cooking oil. However, the cost of cooking oil from other areas is not within our jurisdiction. In addition, as the private factories have just begun to resume normal oil pressing this week, the distribution of oil is not yet sufficient, and some retail stores may have experienced shortages. However, starting next week, as both national and private oil factories resume normal distribution, the cooking oil retail stores will be able to sell regularly at negotiated prices, so citizens can rest assured. Furthermore, any retailers who resell the allocated oil for profit will be severely punished without leniency if discovered.</p>
<p>According to news from the retail oil industry: the industry registered cooking oil retail merchants yesterday, and more than 400 have come to register. The city's sauce, wine, and sauce garden industries also applied to participate in the distribution of cooking oil yesterday. It is said that the retail merchants' association has, in principle, approved the request but requires them to complete the membership procedures first.</p>
<p>Yesterday, Qingdao raw oil reached 140,000 yuan. However, most of this was the asking price of Qingdao merchants stationed in Shanghai, and the goods were all in the hands of the merchants, so retailers said they had no control. However, at such a high price, transactions were extremely rare. It is said that the Social Affairs Bureau still ordered the merchants to sell quickly. Furthermore, the cost of Qingdao raw oil is currently no more than 120,000 yuan. Therefore, the high price will definitely not last long.</p>
<p>Oil Loans Generally Decided: Manufacturers Hope for Increase</p>
<p>The cooking oil market has not yet stabilized. To thoroughly suppress oil prices, Mayor Wu announced that the city bank would loan 500 million yuan as capital for private oil factories to purchase raw materials. The city bank has already drafted measures. The amount of capital required by each factory will be determined by the oil industry association based on the size of each factory's production capacity. The loans will be for three to six months, with an interest rate of 5%, and an audit committee will be established to make the final decision on each factory's loan. The audit committee will be jointly organized by the city government, the oil industry association, and the city bank, and representatives will be invited from the city council to participate. It is said that the committee may be established within the next week, and the loans will begin to be processed. Currently, raw material prices for cooking oil are rising. Sesame is 45,000 yuan per dan, and soybeans are 28,000 yuan per dan. If only 10,000 dan of sesame are purchased, only 4,000 dan of oil can be produced. If 20,000 dan of soybeans are purchased, only 2,000 dan of oil can be produced. Therefore, the amount of 500 million is not sufficient. Private manufacturers hope that Mayor Wu will increase the amount of the loan. It is said that 2 billion would be enough to operate according to actual needs.</p>
<h3 id="e121">Western Merchants Still Have Some Concerns: Public Bonds Fall Moderately <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>Public bonds are still being purchased on behalf of Western merchants by Room 333, which is providing some support in the midst of a market-selling trend. The downward trend has moderated. Unified C opened at 1,350 yuan in the morning, dropping as low as 1,260 yuan before buying pressure emerged, rebounding to 1,420 yuan, and finally hovering around 1,400. As a result, it fell 40 yuan compared to the previous close. A, B, and D each fell 30 yuan, and Unified E fell 100 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e122">Spot Yarn Continues to Rise: Dragon Head Cloth Asks 84,000 <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The yarn market remained stagnant yesterday. 20-count yarn was in demand but unavailable, and prices were particularly chaotic. Generally, it was 20,000 to 30,000 higher. 42-count rose by 100,000, and 16-count remained sluggish. Visiting merchants intended to collect 32-count fine yarn, but the base was extremely scarce. Only Qingdao goods with the Silver Moon brand were brought by northern merchants, with a slight supply of spot goods for sale. The price was about 50,000 to 70,000 higher than last month. Because they already have allocations, practical manufacturers are trading less and less each day. In addition to supplying the goods allocated by the Spinning Management Committee, yarn mills are not selling on the market, so the market is very quiet. The cloth market was flat yesterday morning. In the morning, Fangjian only released the Dragon Head type. The visiting merchants had been watching the market the previous day, but then bought it yesterday afternoon. Dragon Head spot goods are asking 84,000 yuan, and 3A Rainbow Ball is 82,000 yuan. The price of colored cloth has also increased by 3,000 yuan due to the increase in the price of gray cloth and dyes.</p>
<h3 id="e123">Dye Imports Lacking: Sales Also Very Sluggish <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Currently, the city's supply of dyes mostly comes from German Defu dyes distributed by the Enemy Property Administration Bureau. Very few British and American goods are imported. Merchants who specialize in sourcing goods from Hong Kong have very few results. The explanation from business people is that the dye industry was converted to military industry during the war. The major powers have not resumed dye industry due to the tense international situation, so imports are extremely scarce. Some even speculate that the supply will not be sufficient within five years. There are about 180 dye merchants in the city. Their current business is not very prosperous because the dye, silk, and cotton cloth industries are interdependent. The sales can only be expanded if the latter two industries are developed and prosperous. Now that the silk and cloth industries are both sluggish, the demand has naturally declined.</p>
<h3 id="e124">After Delivery Begins: The Situation is Serious, and People are Apathetic; Chinese Stocks Continue to Decline <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, Chinese stocks continued to be difficult to rally due to the serious situation and people's apathy. Except for Xinyihe opening flat, the rest opened slightly lower. After the opening, short sellers covered, and 176 and others also advanced. Buying sentiment suddenly increased, and each stock rebounded above the previous close before many sellers emerged. The situation turned sideways. After 11 o'clock, the situation suddenly turned prosperous again. However, most brokers took the opportunity to sell again and adopted a wait-and-see policy. New buying disappeared, and near noon, floating sellers were triggered to sell, and each stock fell again. Except for the three small hot stocks, the other three hot stocks reappeared at low prices. It stabilized slightly near the close. As a result, compared to the previous close, the hot stocks Yongsha, Meiya, Xinyihe, Jingfu, and Xinguang were each down 2-3%. Qinxing fell very little. The cold stocks Datong Cement rose slightly, and Wuhe and Rongfeng were flat. The rest fell slightly to a half or more. In the afternoon, delivery was implemented, and the market was slightly hidden. However, short sellers took the opportunity to pressure Yongsha during the delivery. Therefore, the spot market was even more sluggish due to the lack of profit-making opportunities. This was beyond the expectations of the general public and stock exchange officials. Some stocks had no listed price. Qinxing, which usually considered itself a small hot stock, also announced that no transactions had been made. The situation was even more tired in the middle of the day, and the foot was softened near the close. The future is miserable. As a result, compared to the previous close, the hot stocks Yongsha, Meiya, Xinyihe, Jingfu, and Xinguang each fell 2% to half or more. Qinxing fell very little. Among the cold stocks, Datong Cement rose slightly, and Wuhe and Rongfeng were flat. The rest fell slightly to a half or more. Outside the market, each stock also fell slightly.</p>
<p>Foreign stocks continued to be weak yesterday. New buying disappeared from each stock, forming a situation where the supply side dominated. However, there was a slight rebound after the low. As a result, compared to the previous close, Yipi, Paper, Shipping, Huide, and General each fell by half or more. The rest fell, although not much.</p>

<p>Over 12,000 shi of rice arrived from the north and south. After continuous sharp declines, stores took advantage of the opportunity to take in, and southern japonica rice rebounded by over 2,000 yuan. White japonica rice also rose by over 1,000 yuan, and indica rice also rose by 1,000 yuan. Yin yuan followed suit, increasing by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. White yuan was high and profitable, and secondary was sluggish. The southern market closed firmly, and the northern market closed slightly weaker. There was a slight movement of Fuzhou soybeans, and the factories made a slight move. Recently, due to a slight reduction in incoming goods and a decrease in inventory, the price rose by over 1,000 yuan. Soybean cakes continued to come from Taiwan and rose by another 100 to 200 yuan. The source of flour continued to continue, digesting its slackness. Wheat sales were sluggish, and corn sales were weak in other areas. Cowpeas were sluggish, and the price fell by 1,000 yuan. Sesame was clearly fixed and secretly increased, and the price of black sesame rose by 1,000 yuan. Raw peanuts from Nanyang were still in operation, and transactions on this street also increased. Demand exceeded supply, and arrivals were not as good as sales, soaring by 4,000 to 5,000 yuan. Towel stalls also increased by 3,000 to 4,000 yuan, which felt quite lively. The oil market was firm, and the factories distributed a total of 300 dan of soybean oil and rapeseed oil, 3 dan per household.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Tea Export Industry Association held an emergency meeting yesterday, chaired by Secretary Ji Shanshan. Two points were unanimously decided: 1. Request the government to handle tea mortgages, intending to request the Chinese Farmers Bank to provide a 70% mortgage based on the production cost of tea, with an interest rate of 3% and an intermediate period of 3 months; 2. Hope that the government will purchase. The association will formally apply to the relevant authorities for the above two items.</p>

<p>Due to various domestic and international factors, the woolen fabric market has generally been weak recently, with few wholesale and retail transactions. The asking price for grass green, grass yellow, thick and thin serge, yellow cloth, gabardine, riding breeches, etc., continues to be lower, and most are even lower than the original cost. The demand from buyers is still extremely lacking. Because most government agencies have allocations, and influenced by blankets and yellow cloth, it is difficult to get a good price for military and political orders. The labor cost of 200,000 per set is still considered too high (each set of guest clothes with raw materials is estimated at 300,000 yuan). Clothing stores in various ports are tasteless and unwilling to operate.</p>

<p>Our country lacks food, among which the supply of wheat is the most serious. It is expected that there will be a shortage before the wheat harvest next year. The authorities are striving to order foreign wheat to meet the raw material needs of domestic flour. According to reliable sources, in order to enrich the food supply, President Song has, in addition to instructing the food diplomacy department to negotiate with the United States, Canada, and other countries to order foreign wheat, also contacted the US government to exchange one million tons of soybeans from our Northeast for the same amount of US wheat, so that each can get its use. It is said that this suggestion has been submitted to the US side and will be clear soon.</p>

The principle is to call on city business associations and industry associations to participate in the review. Each collection office has no authority to check accounts or estimate increases. The audit section is independent, but can only suspend account books for inspection at the bureau and invite representatives from business associations and industry associations to handle them jointly. A concrete plan has already been drafted and was presented yesterday afternoon at the bureau to solicit opinions from industry associations and explain the bureau's policies. Director Gu and Chief Section Officer He Yiwu personally attended. The City Business Association sent representatives Pan Shihao and Zhu Shangyi to the meeting. Director Gu sincerely expressed that if the City Business Association and industry associations can be responsible for proving that the tax reports of the industry are correct, account checking can be omitted. In the future, after each collection office receives the reports from each taxpayer, the bureau will issue them to the relevant industry association for review in order to ensure accuracy. He hopes that everyone will assist to bring tax administration into order. Section Chief He also gave a detailed explanation of the reporting, review, and investigation methods. He still asks the heads of each industry to be responsible for assisting in order to be open. The business association and representatives of each industry elaborated on the reduction of tax rates and how to clearly define the responsibilities of the industry associations and unanimously expressed their willingness to assist in order to completely eliminate the evil practice of harshness. After the meeting, Director Gu retained the representatives of the business association for a cordial discussion and scheduled to reconvene the various industries that did not attend this time to continue the discussion. After the meeting, someone told others that according to the city government's budget, the business tax for the second half of this year should be 9 billion yuan. If it can be collected without harshness, it should not cause any obstacles. However, industry associations should also act cautiously and take into account both the top and the bottom in order to be successful. According to informed sources, the tax rate is currently 1.5% across the board. The authorities have already submitted a request for reduction, but the autumn tax collection will still be collected at the original rate. Those whose income relies on commissions will also be given discretionary treatment. However, those who conceal their income and do not report it, or those who reverse the facts, will not be tolerated.</p>

<p>MacArthur's Headquarters Does Not Allow Export: Foreign Minister Wang Replied to Chu Fucheng</p>
<p>Regarding the matter of transporting Japanese silkworm cocoons to China, the Three-Area Silk Reeling Association telegraphed the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and MacArthur's Headquarters to expedite the transportation of Japanese silkworm cocoons to China in order to meet the raw material needs of silk factories in Jiangsu and Zhejiang. It is learned that Foreign Minister Wang Shijie replied to Director Chu Fucheng of the association yesterday. The original letter is as follows: "Regarding the transportation of Japanese silkworm cocoons to China, I have received your letter. According to the report from the Resident Mission in Japan on the 2nd of last month, the China Silk Company in Shanghai requested that the Allied Headquarters Trade Group be asked to allocate some of the remaining Japanese dry silkworm cocoons for sale to China in order to meet urgent needs. Subsequently, the group replied that the Japanese inventory was only sufficient for domestic use and could not be approved for export. A subsequent letter was sent to the Chief of Staff of the Headquarters, detailing the reasons and requesting consideration. In addition to telegraphing the Mission to report the latest developments in the negotiations, I am writing to you to inquire."</p>
<p>In order to thoroughly resolve the future difficulties of the entire silk reeling industry, the Three-Area Silk Association held a standing council meeting at the China Silk Company at 2:00 pm yesterday to discuss concrete measures for the government to adopt.</p>
<h3 id="e134">Bank of England Relinquishes Silver Market <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 13th] It has finally been revealed here that the Bank of England has now relinquished the silver market and is now transferring its US silver purchasing rights to London gold and silver brokers. The ostensible reason for this move by the Bank is that Britain will soon replace silver coins with copper wire coins for use as circulating currency, so the Bank of England no longer needs to act as an intermediary. The underlying reason is that the Bank of England has acknowledged that the purchase of silver by speculators is probably more profitable than by official bodies. Under the new plan, the Bank will no longer buy silver itself, but will instead allocate US dollars to London gold and silver brokers so that they can purchase it directly from the United States and then resell it to users in essential industries here. However, the Bank of England will still control the quantity purchased by controlling the allocation of US dollars for the purchase of silver. But this quantity will not be large, as the quantity purchased with US dollars will continue to be limited to essential industries here, so the official London market will continue to supply at a price of 55.5 pence per ounce.</p>
<h3 id="e135">Spinning Control Committee Expects Black Market in Cotton Yarn to Be Eliminated; Adjustments to Yarn Allocation by Count Will Begin with Reporting <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The Spinning Control Committee held its eleventh regular meeting yesterday at 5:00 PM. A summary of the discussions follows: (1) The black market price of cotton yarn still exists because some merchants who bought in at high prices have not yet cleared their stock. However, it is estimated that after this batch of high-priced goods is cleared by the end of this month, the black market price of cotton yarn will naturally disappear. (2) To date, very few people holding allocation slips have returned them to the factories for refunds. (3) In the past month, over 20,000 bales of Wuhan cotton yarn have arrived. Many of these were transported to Guangzhou via the Guangdong-Hankou Railway, causing a sudden surge in traffic on the railway, and even a black market for transportation prices. (4) Recently, due to price negotiation issues, cotton yarn in Shanghai has been shipped out to other areas, causing the black market price in Changzhou to be lower than that in Shanghai. (5) Regarding the request from the Reproduction Products Guild to adjust the count and quantity of yarn allocated, and the application for yarn allocation from newly joined members, all Reproduction Products Guilds are urged to promptly report the current actual production, equipment status, and actual needs of each factory of their members in detail for review and approval. (6) In principle, there are no more issues with the Central Bank providing foreign exchange for cotton purchases. However, all yarn mills should quickly report their current cotton inventory to the Spinning Control Committee for review and approval.</p>
<p>Additionally, application forms for the Spinning Control Committee's yarn for transport to the south must be submitted before the 25th of each month. Late submissions will be considered as a waiver, and the Spinning Control Committee will allocate the waived amount to other needy manufacturers in the following month.</p>

<p>Chemical raw materials in general high demand, including soda ash, rosin, beeswax, and potassium chlorate, have all risen by 10 to 20 percent. Potassium chlorate purchased by merchants from Jiangxi has risen to 95,000 yuan per dan (approximately 50 kg). The price of American caustic soda soared again the day before yesterday, reaching 1.15 million yuan for 300 kilograms. Those holding the goods are still holding out for higher prices. Yesterday, local Shanghai manufacturers were again eager to buy, and merchants from other provinces were planning to raise prices to compete, making the market extremely tight. However, some believe that this soaring price is purely due to speculation, and that actual sales are not that high. Furthermore, goods are continuously arriving from Europe and Hong Kong, with prices half of the market price. A certain foreign firm received 2,000 barrels yesterday and it is said that distribution will begin soon.</p>

<p>The Chen You Cup Basketball League continues tonight from 6:00 PM with three games in Groups A and B, still held at the YMCA Gymnasium in Baxianqiao. Tickets are uniformly 1,000 yuan. The first game, between Lianqing of Group B and Youai Green, starts at 6:00 PM. This is followed by the Six Points Team, returning from Taiwan with honors, against Muir. The highlight of the evening, starting at 7:30 PM, is the game between the Shantou Team and Green Forest. The former is a seasoned veteran of the basketball scene, led by Liu Jingxing, Cai Yanxiong, and Lin Weicong, all skilled and combative players. Green Forest, although a rising young team, has fought hard against strong opponents over the past year. However, their chances of winning against Shantou today are slim. The schedule is as follows:</p>
<p>Lianqing vs. Youai Green (Group B Friendly): 6:00 PM</p>

<p>The Philippine Black and White Men's and Women's Basketball Teams, whose men's team made their debut the day before yesterday, narrowly defeated Renyu by one point. Yesterday, the Basketball Committee decided that the second and third games of the visiting team, one men's and one women's game, would be combined into one day. Ticket prices have been increased accordingly, to 4,000 yuan upstairs and 7,000 yuan downstairs. (If there is only one game in the future, the original price will be restored). Today, in the second game, the Black and White Women's Team will play against Qinglian, and the Black and White Men's Team will play against the Expedition Wheel Team. The day after tomorrow (Sunday), the Snow White Team and the Shantou Team will respectively play. Both women's games will be played under women's rules.</p>
<p>US Military Challenge</p>
<p>It is also reported that the YMCA Basketball Team of the US military intends to challenge the Black and White Team. They have sent a letter to the Basketball Committee requesting that a team or two, composed of elite players selected from the 14 US military teams, be formed to compete against the Philippine team in one or two games. It is said that the Basketball Committee has accepted this in principle.</p>
<p>Debut Performance</p>
<p>In today's game, the women's teams will take the court first at 5:45 PM. The Black and White Women's Team will make its debut against Qinglian. The visiting team swept through Hong Kong and Guangzhou, undefeated (losing only to the Hong Kong All-Star Men's Team), and is accustomed to using men's rules. Changing to women's rules this time may prevent them from fully demonstrating their skills. However, given the team's excellent technique, they will certainly give a fantastic performance. Qinglian's women's basketball skills are improving rapidly, and with Wang Wuli joining the team, their strength has been greatly enhanced, and they will certainly put up a fierce fight against the visiting team.</p>
<p>Facing the Expedition Wheel Team</p>
<p>At 6:30 PM, the men's teams will take the court. The Black and White Men's Team will make its second appearance against the Luoyang Expedition Wheel Team. The Black and White Team's initial performance the night before last was not as good as expected. However, Xiao Huatuo, Fu Yongxin, Guo Guoye, Shen Renshou, and Cai Jindian, the "Five Tigers", are technically outstanding and still received good reviews. Furthermore, the whole team will be more familiar with the venue today and will certainly perform better. The Expedition Wheel Team has repeatedly defeated strong opponents in Shanghai, gaining a reputation. Continuing their expedition to Beijing and Wuxi, they have maintained their momentum, dominating southern Jiangsu. Yu Ruizhang, Tu Wenlong, and Cai Zhongqiang, the "Three Musketeers," are energetic and lively. Having waited in Shanghai for a long time to face the Black and White Team, they will finally have their wish fulfilled and will certainly do their best in the game, fighting the visiting team to the death. The schedule for the two days and the rosters of the four teams for today are listed below:</p>

<p>[Report from Our Newspaper in Suzhou] Major General Ma Shigong, Commander of the Suzhou Garrison, has initiated the organization of the Wu County Sports Promotion Committee to promote sports and strengthen the national physique. The All-Suzhou Basketball Championship organized by the committee has received enthusiastic responses, with registration reaching a total of 21 men's and women's teams by the deadline of the 11th.

At 2:00 PM on the 12th, the Promotion Committee held an opening ceremony at the Dongwu University Gymnasium in Tianshizhuang and began the first day of competition. Thousands of people from all walks of life attended to watch. Commander Ma (concurrently), Commissioner Xu of the Second District, and Secretary Jin of the County Party Committee all delivered speeches. After the ceremony, Commander Ma (concurrently) tossed the ball to begin the competition. In the first game, the 202nd Division's Youth Army Team faced the Dongwu University West Team. The two teams were evenly matched, and the game was full of excitement. The 202nd Division's fast passing and unusual tactics made it difficult for Dongwu to cope. In the end, the 202nd Division won 39-27. In the second game, Nanxing faced Kangle. Although Nanxing had a reputation as the champion of the Fuxing Cup, Kangle had famous players such as sports pioneers Shi Jiuquan, Wang Shoufang, and Li Jianbang. After the game started, Nanxing quickly became overwhelmed and retreated step by step, suffering a crushing defeat of 15-31. In the third game, Taihe faced Jingfan. Taihe was an amateur team, while Jingfan was a school team. Although Jingfan had received good training and rarely committed fouls, Taihe's effective offense and fast coordination ultimately led to a 14-10 victory by one point, and Jingfan was defeated. There will be three more games on the 13th: Dongwu High School vs. 202nd Division Youth Army Ze Team, Yancheng vs. Cuiying, and Pingguang vs. 16th Artillery Regiment. Subsequent matches will be held daily until the champion is decided on the 20th. The atmosphere has been enthusiastic in recent days, and the road to Tianshizhuang has been filled with spectators.</p>

<h3 id="e158">The Front Line of the Northern Section of the Pinghan Railway <a href="#e158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent Song Shaobo stationed in Beiping for this Newspaper</p>
<p>Beiping Air Mail on the 4th</p>
<p>When the war on the northern section of the Pinghan Railway was at its most intense, I was ordered on October 30th to go to the front line of the Pingbao section to inspect. The places I stopped along the way were Songlin Store, Ding, Beihe Store, Gucheng, and Xushui. Taking advantage of the fact that the communist army and the national army were concentrating their forces in Chahar Province, the communist army launched an offensive on the northern section of the Pinghan Railway starting from September 29th, advancing northwards and capturing cities. After the war in Chahar Province came to an end, a main force of the national army transferred to this line, gradually recovering lost locations such as Songlin Store. By November 2nd, Xushui was recovered, and the communist army's control over the Pingbao section had disintegrated. I returned to Beiping on the evening of the 3rd. The commander of the 94th Army, Mou Tingfang, who commanded the national army's operations in this section, returned to Ping from the front on the same day to report the course of operations to the authorities and to discuss the next step of opening up the Baoshi section.</p>
<p>I met Commander Mou Tingfang and his staff, division commanders, and Wang Lihuan, the division commander of the 130th Division of the 53rd Army, who was temporarily under Mou Tingfang's command and advancing towards the front. This is a soldier who has always stood at the forefront. Commander Mou, who set up the forward command post in Zhuoxian, went to the front almost every day to supervise the army. At 10:30 AM on the 2nd, when Xushui was recovered, Commander Mou entered the city with me and others at 11:30 AM. When Commander Mou shook hands with Commander Wang, who had entered the city with the army, he showed the joy of a soldier after victory.</p>
<p>On the other hand, I spent more time visiting Cui Shichang, the commissioner of the 6th Administrative Region of Hebei Province, who had his office in Zhuoxian (he was the chief of staff when Fu Zuoyi was besieged in Zhuoxian for three months in the 16th year of the Republic of China, and the deputy chief of staff when Liu Zhi was the commander of the 6th War Zone), as well as the county magistrates of each county, and the common people under artillery fire. During the five-day field trip, I got the following impressions: "Fighting the communists is easy and difficult." "Both sides are good, but it's not good for us common people." "Years of construction destroyed in an instant will not be able to be rebuilt by our own existing strength." "The common people are caught between 'traitorous bandits' and 'Eighth Route Army'." "Local administration and military affairs are paramount." "Generals fighting in the war have peace hidden in their hearts."</p>
<p>Fighting the Communist Army is Easy and Difficult</p>
<p>Can military force solve the problem? A definitive answer still cannot be obtained on the front line. Perhaps it can be said this way: those who personally fight the communist army are mostly cautious about this issue. Officers below the rank of regimental commander do not underestimate the communist army. The goals that the national army wants to achieve are almost always achieved, but the energy spent on each stronghold after occupation is no less than during the attack. Every time the national army attacks a target, no matter how fierce the battle is, the communist army ultimately retreats. If the air force cooperates well, the communist army will suffer even more severe losses on the vast plains of the north. In the battle of Xushui County and the railway station, 5,000 communist soldiers were exposed to the air force's machine guns, and the communist army suffered great losses in this battle, but they did not lose their weapons, and the distance of the evacuation was only ten miles. They are ready to make a comeback at any time. One communist soldier is served by three common people. These common people often die on the two grenades he wears on his body. According to a soldier, the communist soldiers who charge are common people (called militiamen by the communist side), and those who sneak into the national army's positions at night to throw grenades and bury mines are also common people. These "militiamen," who have been slightly trained, die by the hundreds and thousands! Because of this, I asked Commander Mou whether he would allow these common people, who hardly know what fighting is, to die in such large numbers? Commander Mou said: "If you don't kill him, he will throw grenades at you!" "Don't those people know they will be killed?" "If he doesn't die under the guns of the national army, he will die in the hands of the communist army behind him. He has to go up!" Among the tens of thousands of common people repairing the railway, I saw that there were indeed few adults!</p>
<p>"Pocket tactics" was a tactic used by the communist army this time between Caohe and Xushui, but under the national army with excellent equipment, the "pocket" was pierced by the iron thorn, and the main force had to retreat to the western mountains. In order to always catch the main force of the communist army, the 94th Army formed a motorized rapid force in the last two days, which gave the communist army a serious threat. The communist army's tactics have always been to hide during the day and attack at night, but the communist army in the Pingbao section turned into retreating during the day. They occasionally attacked the national army's strongholds at night, but not once was successful. However, it is still not easy to eliminate the communist army. According to a chief of staff who commanded the battle, the biggest trouble for the national army is the feeling that the local military force and politics do not cooperate with the military, which makes people unable to avoid worries about the future. The village-level cadres of the government are far less powerful than the village-level cadres of the Communist Party, which is a very simple problem. The security police force and the self-defense regiment are poorly armed and poorly trained, and it is difficult to avoid losing the stronghold under the communist army's concentrated force. Because the loss of the city is too great, Sun Lianzhong, the chairman of Hebei Province, recently issued an order that all county magistrates who lose the city will be dismissed regardless of the reason.</p>
<p>Years of Construction Destroyed in an Instant</p>
<p>In the places I passed, the only job of those common people every day was "digging up the road" and "repairing the road." In the future, there may also be a "watching the road" task to come to their heads. According to a railway worker, he knew that a telephone pole had been cut down more than 500 times. The length of the railway that was dug up in the northern section of the Pinghan Railway this time was as long as 150 kilometers, and more than 80 holes of steel bridges were blown up. In order to dig up the road, the communist army specially organized an engineering battalion. The speed and thoroughness of the destruction can be called the world's first. The 29 holes of the steel bridge in Beihe Store were completely blown up, the bridge foundation collapsed, and the bridge was blown up. According to an old man in his eighties, it took exactly six years to build this steel bridge back then, and it took three nights to destroy it under the communist army's excellent technology. The deafening explosions killed nine infants in the neighboring village who were less than two months old. It may not be possible for our technology to succeed in repairing it again. In order to prevent the roadbed from being built for a while, the communist army drove the common people within dozens of miles to dig deep ditches with curved and staggered lines. Steel rails were placed on the sleepers and burned with fire. The sleepers burned into ashes, and the steel rails became scrap iron. According to the authorities of the Pinghan Railway, the existing equipment has almost been used up. Such a large-scale destruction makes it really difficult to repair. Therefore, the road repair project is only a few miles a day. On the roadbed that has just been repaired, it takes two hours to travel thirty miles. On the road, passengers can get off the bus to urinate and still get back on the bus. All the houses and railway facilities of the Songlin Store, Gaobeidian, Dingxing, Beihe Store, Gucheng and other stations I saw were completely destroyed. The thoroughness of the destruction in Beihe Store made people pass by the place without knowing that it had been a station. Now the railway people work in the iron gate car. The local government is launching "labor service." Every day, 20,000 common people repair the road. Old men in their seventies and eighties and children in their teens each bring two corn rations to do this uncompensated work until it is repaired. An old man repairing the road said with wet eyes: "We already knew when we were driven to destroy that we would still be the ones repairing the road!" Some people who had railway equipment hidden in their homes sent it back, but most of it was no longer usable. Anyone who had a rail spike found in their home was guilty of collaborating with the communists. In addition to the railway, all public buildings in the places that the communist army occupied and evacuated were also completely destroyed. No one has been able to calculate the number of such large-scale destruction. Seeing these remnants of destruction really makes people feel like the end of the world is coming. Commander Mou usually doesn't say much when talking about the communist army, but every time he mentions the communist army's destructive behavior, he will angrily say "Damn it."</p>
<p>Xiao Peisun, the secretary-general of the Zhuoxian County Party Department, told me that when he went to the countryside to inspect, he asked the common people whether the Communist Party or the government was better. The common people replied with sad faces: "The Communist Party is good, and the government is also good, but what is not good is us common people!" He almost burst into tears when he heard this. The kind common people don't understand any ideology, they only know that every army that comes wants them to take things out. The houses were even destroyed by artillery fire before the army arrived. The Communist Party wants to conscript "militiamen." Although they all know and even see "militiamen" being killed by guns, they still have to let their sons be conscripted.</p>
<p>Common People Complain: Secretary Xiao Almost Bursts into Tears</p>
<p>The common people in the areas where the national army is stationed generally say that the discipline of the national army is much stronger than before the War of Resistance. This is the first time these common people have seen the national army. Although the burden is heavier, they hope that the national army will stay. The common people are terrified of the tug-of-war. Therefore, they secretly wish to take out more things. Speaking of the 94th Army, it has won the love of the local common people. The only thing the army takes from the local area is firewood, and there is no difficulty in requisitioning it. At present, each soldier gets enough dry firewood, and the price is 50 yuan, which is half the market price. This is because the public funds issued from above can only afford this amount. In addition, the local burden on the army is to buy coffins for the soldiers who died in battle and requisition them, giving 8,000 yuan a day, which can be called public buying and selling, and the merchants are welcome to station the national army, so their business will be better. What is painful is the subsidy for local teams and administrative personnel, which will kill the merchants. To give an example, a security team has one hundred and one people, and the total public funds are one million per month, which is eight or nine thousand per person. It is not enough to eat a corn bun once a day, but they have to live in order to protect the local area, so the local area has to bear this amount. A merchant in Zhuoxian told me that his store sells about 100,000 yuan a day and has a total of twelve partners, but since this year, he has paid nearly one million yuan in contributions. He said that if this continues, how many stores will close by the end of the year? The shocking burden is even more incalculable. The communist party's conscription, liquidation, and the government's apportionments and land taxes. If one mu of land yields one dan of grain a year, seven dou of rice must be taken out to respond to "official errands." Although it is a national army garrison, it is still impossible not to give grain to the communist party, because except for the county seat, few villages belong completely to the national army day and night. Aside from apportionments, corvee is secondary. After the war started, there were about 10,000 refugees from neighboring counties who fled to Zhuoxian, who could not be saved without help. Although the provincial government issued 10 million yuan in relief funds every time, it is unknown how much was used for emergency relief. These refugees are looking forward to the relief from the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration.</p>

<p>— Special Correspondent of This Newspaper, Hang Zhou</p>
<p>I live in Room 207 of the Chahar Hotel. There is a wooden cupboard that the communist army did not take away. When I opened it, I saw a slogan written in chalk: "Go to Democracy!" In Zhangjiakou, such slogans can even be found in the toilets. When the war in northern Jiangsu was fierce, I traveled in that bloody land for three months and had some understanding of the Communist Party's so-called "democracy." This time I came to Zhangjiakou, hoping to get a different impression. I said, I hope to hear some good criticisms of the Communist Party from the people, even if it is one in a thousand or ten thousand, it is enough to satisfy my curiosity.</p>
<h3 id="e160">Traitors to Democracy <a href="#e160" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c160" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">160</a></h3>
<p>Huang Yuan, the member of the Communist Party Chahar Provincial Government who represents the working class, was originally a worker in the Ping Sui Railway Machinery Depot. He is forty-three years old this year and has only studied for three years. He has been doing work peacefully for eighteen years. When the Communist Party came, in order to show "democracy," they wanted the workers to elect a representative to participate in the government. He was elected in a daze, which he had never dreamed of! He became a member in fear and opened many meetings, but the meetings only ate refreshments or attended banquets, and he was not asked to express his opinions at all, and it was impossible to express his opinions. The Provincial Government Committee has a so-called "three-thirds system," which means that the Communist Party occupies three seats, and the rest belong to various parties and non-parties. This is a puppet show, and Huang Yuan has been a puppet for nearly a year. Well, when the national army arrived in Zhangjiakou, Huang Yuan abandoned his wife and children and surrendered to the national army. He felt comforted in his conscience.</p>
<p>I asked him: "Are you not afraid that your wife and children will suffer?"</p>
<p>"There is no way!" He said with a sad face: "I don't know where they went!" Xu Chenqiu, the commander of the communist army guard regiment, who has defected, now has a new title: Commander of the Chahar Southwest Bandit Suppression. He said: "The Communist Party's democratic logic is like this: the minority obeys the interests of the majority, and the interests of the majority obey the interests of the party." Therefore, violating the interests of the party is not democratic. This is indeed the true spirit of Mao Zedong's "New Democracy."</p>
<p>What the Communist Party can be very relieved about is that there are almost "no" minority interests in the so-called "liberated areas." A worker said: "We have to raise our hands even if we don't agree. What we say is like farting. Once, I said a few words, and they thought it was unpleasant and was hanged for a day and a night." A doctor who was "honorably" elected as a senator by the Communist Party told me: "On the first day of the meeting, I put forward several proposals, and the next day I was warned." "Freedom of speech" is established under such circumstances: when two communists are talking, how can they not eavesdrop? When two friends meet on the street, a communist must be standing next to them to be able to talk. In this way, the Communist Party has completed their "brilliant" "democratic politics."</p>
<p>If all the people are as stupid as cows, pointing east and going east, and never turning north when pointing west, wouldn't the world be settled? Therefore, the Communist Party brought out the policy of fooling the people from the "coffin" of history, starting with the cadres. Farmers, blacksmiths, and Jianghu heroes who kill, set fire, are the most standard talents. Intellectuals, bah! Useless guys, there is a big problem with their brains, they must be thoroughly reformed. A communist army company commander who had defected told me that it was because he had studied for a few years that he could not become a party member, and he was always neglected.</p>
<p>Intellectuals and people over forty years old have to be sent to the "cold palace," and may even suffer the "cha" knife. Because they are "stubborn," easily shaken, and obstacles to their uniform "democratic politics." But the Communist Party also has its one-line education.</p>
<p>A sixteen-year-old first-year junior high school student said: "In school, the teachers always teach us to dance and sing Yangko...A year's time has been wasted, and we have not gained any basic knowledge.</p>
<p>"But in addition to this, we must take political class every day. What Marxism is, the merits of the Eighth Route Army, the bastards of the diehards...A big set of ramblings. Teachers often do not bring textbooks when they come to class, they only teach us to read newspapers."</p>
<p>Zhang Guanxing, a reporter from the Associated Press, asked him a question: "You have taken political class for a year, can you talk about the content of Marxism?"</p>
<p>He laughed: "Everyone must attend political class, and the classroom is so quiet that you can hear a pin drop. It turns out that everyone is tired of sleeping.--So I don't understand at all now."</p>
<p>Then he said: "Dismantling rotten things is a good student. If you study hard, the school will suspect: 'Are you related to Nanjing?'"</p>
<p>The Communist Party's education for workers is also like this. They sing loudly about the "three-eight system," but they still have to work two more hours every day. During the so-called study, it is a political class. There are two workers in the Zhangjiakou South Power Plant, one is called "steamed not cooked" and the other is called "boiled not rotten." The one called "boiled not rotten" said to me: "As soon as the bell rings, you have to lower your head and go. If you don't go, they will call you a 'national agent'. But whether I listen to it or not is up to me. I usually turn a deaf ear to it, so they call me 'boiled not rotten'." This should be the Communist Party's sorrow!</p>
<h3 id="e161">The Story of Counting Chicken Eggs <a href="#e161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>"Struggle," "settle accounts," and "turn over." These are the Communist Party's three-in-one "revolutionary" methods. In name, it seems to be striving for the working masses and attacking the bourgeoisie; but tearing down the western mirror reveals it to be the most vicious method of plunder.</p>
<p>For example, the land struggle launched by tenant farmers against landlords, which is attracting worldwide attention, is also a way to absorb land in the so-called "tenant farmer liberation movement."</p>
<p>After the landlords are overthrown, the land is distributed, part of it becomes public land, and part of it becomes the private property of powerful Communist Party members (Communist Party cadres are not corrupt, that is to say to three-year-old children). The tenant farmers get only a small part. And this new "landlord," when he was a tenant farmer, could live by paying rent. Now, of his harvest, he is only allowed to keep one and a half rents of wheat for his whole family. The rest is collected according to "points." The so-called "point" is a unit based on one dan. If the harvest is three dan of wheat, in addition to the one rent and five dou left, there is also one rent and five dou, which is "one and a half points." There is no standard for collection, nor is there a fixed period. Sometimes, one point requires five dou to be collected, and sometimes it has to be collected twice a month. The final result of the collection is: all the harvests, including the one rent and a half left, are collected, or are not enough. Therefore, "If the benefits do not belong to me, why should I love the land?" The common people are all willing to give up the land and let it lie fallow.</p>
<p>Regarding settling accounts, there is a "chicken egg accounting story":</p>
<p>The Eighth Route Army asked a coolie: "Hey! Has that wealthy family ever borrowed money from you?"</p>
<p>"Old man, don't joke! If I had money to lend to others, I wouldn't be like this."</p>
<p>"Then have they ever borrowed wheat from you?"</p>
<p>"There is more wheat rotting in their warehouses every year!"</p>
<p>"Stupid guy! I'm asking you if they ever borrowed chicken eggs from you?" The Eighth Route Army asked impatiently and sternly.</p>
<p>The coolie was stunned and said, "They did borrow a chicken egg."</p>
<p>The Eighth Route Army raised his eyebrows: "How long ago did they borrow it?"</p>
<p>"It's been a few years, maybe four years! They were making a feast and were one chicken egg short. They came to my house to borrow it and said they would return it tomorrow. Tomorrow, uh, they probably forgot. Uh, it's just one chicken egg, it doesn't matter!" The coolie scratched his head and said.</p>
<p>"Stupid guy! One chicken egg is a big deal! Tell you, you have to settle accounts with them! I'll help you earn a living!" The Eighth Route Army showed his jagged yellow teeth.</p>
<p>He was even more confused--how to calculate it? So, the Eighth Route Army told him: One chicken egg can hatch a chick. When the chick grows into a hen, it will lay at least one hundred chicken eggs a year. One hundred chicken eggs hatch into one hundred chicks, and when the chicks grow into hens, one hundred hens can lay 10,000 chicken eggs a year. The eggs hatch into chickens again, and the chickens lay eggs again. After four years, one chicken egg is equal to tens of thousands of chickens. Isn't this number considerable? Why don't you settle accounts with him?</p>
<p>The coolie seemed to suddenly see the light: "That's right! I still have such a big debt outside!"</p>
<p>So, one, two, three, count to ten thousand years!</p>
<p>The wealthy family was ruined, and not to mention repaying the debt for a chicken egg four years ago. They fled. The coolie became the master of this property. The Eighth Route Army, carrying a Mauser pistol, winked at him and said:</p>
<p>"Hey, stupid kid! This time it's enough for you to enjoy. Who gave you such a benefit?"</p>
<p>"The Communist Party!"</p>
<p>"Stupid kid! You should repay Ong Da!"</p>
<p>The new rich man was stunned again: "Old man, what are you saying?"</p>
<p>The one carrying the Mauser pistol took out a slip of paper with the words: "Donate 30% for the living expenses of the soldiers, and 50% to participate in the cooperative fund."</p>
<p>"Look, this is how you are a patriot!"</p>
<p>Okay, he still has 20%--at least it's better than nothing, he is still very happy.</p>
<p>As usual, what Zhang San got has to be donated. After several cycles of liquidation, everything was donated.</p>
<h3 id="e162">Twenty Minutes' Chat with a Platoon Leader <a href="#e162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>Ignorant and unlearned people, although they do not understand politics and do not care about dynasties, understand in their hearts. They think over and over about following the Eighth Route Army in their struggles. The result of the liquidation is that the rich have become poor, but the poor have not become rich. The poor only get hatred! The Communist Party attempts to create hatred between people to consolidate their rule and carry out their exploitation. As a result, they are burned by the fire they started: the rich, needless to say, abhor the Communist Party, but what is truly a miracle is that even the poor grit their teeth in hatred!</p>
<p>Within the Communist Party's own ranks, as long as there is still a shred of humanity, they are deeply disgusted with the Party's brutal policies. I had a twenty-minute conversation with an Eighth Route Army platoon leader who surrendered. He said resentfully, "Those who participated in the Long March occupy a special position in the Eighth Route Army. This group of people are arrogant, self-indulgent, and do whatever they want." Non-Long March cadres below the battalion level are restricted in everything, and even marriage is not free. On the contrary, for battalion commanders and above, encouraging marriage is a way to win them over. Once married, they have more worries and are bound to obey orders obediently.</p>
<p>He resented the war, feeling that it was unjustifiable. He told me: Once, when he was going to the front line, he sighed, "Alas! Self-inflicted fratricide!" When the political instructor found out, he was subjected to individual talks, then group criticism, followed by struggle sessions. He said, "I have been in the Eighth Route Army for several years and have made some contributions. To end up like this, why did I come here? Now, many in the Eighth Route Army want to defect, but they are worried about how the Nationalist army will treat them after they defect. If they knew that there would be no hardship, those who are oppressed and used as cannon fodder would defect at any opportunity." From the Nationalist army, I obtained a suicide note from a Communist soldier. It read: "Japan has surrendered, and we should enjoy happiness, but the Eighth Route Army does not let us have a good life, and they arrest young people in every village to fight in the civil war. We made contributions in fighting Japan, for the sake of the people not being oppressed. Now we are fighting a civil war, and even if we die, it is without value. I want to gloriously defect, but I don't know what the Nationalist army is like. If I retreat, I will be shot by the officers, so I commit suicide. Eighth Route Army comrades, defect and escape! Otherwise, you will also be sacrificed on the battlefield. Comrades: Think about who you are fighting for? Who are you dying for!" After talking with many farmers, workers, merchants, students, and defected Communist soldiers, I asked curiously, "Doesn't the Communist Party do anything good for you?"</p>
<p>"Heavens!" an old man exclaimed, "If the Communist Party did any good, wouldn't I follow them?"</p>
<p>A soldier said, "Otherwise, I wouldn't have defected!"...</p>
<p>Commander Fu Zuoyi said to the press corps: "The military failure of the Communist Party can be judged by common sense, but its political failure would not be believed if one did not come to Zhangjiakou, especially the belief that its political failure is so tragic!"</p>
<p>"The Communist Party's propaganda policy can be summarized in one sentence: it is deception!" Fu said again: "The further away people are, the more they sympathize with the Communist Party. People in Kunming or those who sympathize with the Communist Party are more numerous. People in Tianjin are much less so, and in Zhangjiakou, there is a universal hatred of the Communist Party's policies. So some people say: where the Communist Party goes, it is like getting a vaccination, and this place will never have the Communist Party again." Reuters reporter Campbell expressed his feelings: "What I heard in Nanjing has been proven completely wrong here!"</p>

<h3 id="e163">What is Surgical Treatment? <a href="#e163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>— Lan Yi</p>
<p>Surgical treatment occupies a special place in modern medicine. Some diseases can only be cured with surgical treatment. However, the general public often has a fearful attitude towards surgical treatment. This is because of the lack of medical knowledge and understanding. It is common to see patients hesitate even after being advised by doctors to undergo surgical treatment, or to seek remedies indiscriminately in the hope of avoiding surgery. As a result, they delay treatment until even surgeons feel helpless. Therefore, to break this fearful attitude, it is essential to have sufficient medical knowledge to avoid unnecessary sacrifices.</p>
<p>What is surgical treatment? Treatment of diseases often uses various methods. Sometimes, instruments are used to perform surgery. This is surgical treatment, or surgical therapy, commonly known as "cutting out the disease" or "surgery." However, the terms "cutting out the disease" or "surgery" cannot encompass all surgical treatments. For example, orthopedic mechanical therapy is also a type of surgical treatment.</p>
<p>The evolution of surgical treatment: Surgical treatment is one of the oldest therapies and is a natural therapy for humans. A thorn or foreign object in the body is always removed. When there is bleeding in the body, pressure is naturally used to stop the bleeding. This is all taught by human nature, which is called surgical treatment in primitive times. Later, as humans gained more experience, understood anatomy, and invented instruments, this treatment gradually progressed, but with little scientific basis, it was still a technical therapy. With the rise of modern science, medical progress has also been rapid. Utilizing the results of scientific research, such as the progress of pathology, bacteriology, physiology, physiological chemistry, and pharmacology, and with the help of sophisticated instruments, and referring to the results of experimental surgery, the scope of surgical treatment is now much wider than it was a hundred years ago.</p>
<p>Scope of surgical treatment</p>
<p>(1) Most surgical treatments are for acute conditions that pose a danger. The body cannot overcome these conditions, and only immediate surgical treatment can save lives. In a wound, bleeding from a major blood vessel can be fatal if hemostasis is not achieved artificially. Injuries to internal organs are even more serious. Without immediate repair or treatment, there is no hope of survival. Sometimes, a person suffers from a disease and suddenly develops a critical symptom, such as intestinal perforation from typhoid fever, gastric ulcer perforation, or diphtheria causing tracheal obstruction. Without immediate surgical treatment to temporarily relieve the fatal danger, life cannot be preserved. This type of surgical treatment does not directly treat typhoid fever, gastric ulcers, or diphtheria, but it removes a major symptom.</p>
<p>(2) In modern cities, everything is done mechanically to save time, which has led to an increasing number of injuries. In early trauma, before infectious bacteria have had time to colonize, a debridement can be performed, which can not only repair the wound and shorten the healing process, but also avoid the sequelae of bacterial infection and spreading to other tissues. Fractures must have surgical treatment. Fractures can heal on their own, but the tension of the muscles can cause the fractured bone to shift from its original position, resulting in shortening of the limb and deformity, eventually leading to disability. Surgery uses mechanical methods to guide and fix the fracture, preventing the muscles from shortening and restoring the normal position, so that the fractured limb can function normally after healing. Surgical treatment can also prevent or correct deformities caused by certain diseases.</p>
<p>(3) Most inflammations in the body are caused by bacterial infection. Some require surgical treatment, which can not only shorten the course of the disease, but also remove the danger. A boil will eventually become an abscess, but the slower the abscess develops, the longer the course of the disease will be. Every suppurating lesion has the potential to allow bacteria to enter the bloodstream and cause blood poisoning. Early incision and drainage can avoid this danger. Surgical treatment is merely following the natural process to shorten the course of the disease and save the patient's strength. Appendicitis (commonly known as appendicitis) may heal on its own without surgery, but it may also suppurate or rupture, leading to peritonitis, which is extremely dangerous. If the inflamed appendix is removed early before suppuration or rupture, the focus of infection can be removed, completely cured, and the great danger of suppuration or rupture can be avoided. Other non-essential organs of the body can also become diseased. If relatively safe therapies are ineffective, surgical treatment can be used as a last resort, depending on whether it affects the body's function.</p>
<p>(4) The body is not without a protective response to the invasion of foreign objects. A bullet in the body can be surrounded by fibrous tissue and remain in the body for decades without causing danger. A splinter in the body can cause suppuration and be discharged with the pus. However, if foreign objects remain in the body and obstruct important organs or functions, surgical treatment should be used to remove them to avoid future problems, such as kidney stones, bladder stones, gallstones, etc., which are all best removed.</p>
<p>(5) Tumors are pathological forms of tissue in the body, similar to foreign objects. However, they grow by relying on the blood supply of the body, so they are very detrimental to health. Benign tumors may not cause patients to feel pain, but if they grow too large or are located in an unfavorable position, they can also obstruct the body and should be removed as soon as possible. Malignant tumors are directly harmful to the body and can endanger life. Most malignant tumors are difficult to detect because the symptoms are not obvious. By the time patients discover them on their own, it is often too late. Therefore, if something feels abnormal in a certain part of the body, it is best to see a doctor for examination as soon as possible. Sometimes, an X-ray examination is needed to make a diagnosis. Regarding treatment, although radium has recently been discovered and can be used to treat malignant tumors, it is not widely used, and surgical treatment is still commonly used. Early treatment can prevent tumor cells from metastasizing to other parts of the body, causing damage to the entire body. Therefore, the success of treatment depends on the earliness of diagnosis.</p>
<p>The safety of surgical treatment? Everyone knows that one should seek medical treatment early when sick. The safety of surgical treatment is also closely related to the time of seeking medical treatment. The earlier one seeks medical treatment, the safer the surgery will be. If one has a surgical illness and still prays to gods, worships Buddha, casts lots, or takes one or two doses of herbal medicine in the hope of being cured, this will only delay treatment and reduce the safety of surgical treatment. Therefore, early medical treatment can lead to early surgical treatment, which solves the patient's safety problem. Once the safety issue is clearly understood, there will be no fear.</p>
<h3 id="e164">Talking About Menstruation <a href="#e164" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c164" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">164</a></h3>
<p>— Liu Benli</p>
<p>Menstruation in women is a common physiological phenomenon. Readers must be familiar with the term menstruation. But what exactly is menstruation? What are the related circumstances of its occurrence? Even if we ask the ladies who have experienced it themselves, probably few people understand these questions. Simply put, menstruation is a periodic uterine blood discharge, which occurs roughly regularly except during pregnancy.</p>
<p>The Mechanism of Menstruation</p>
<p>To discuss menstruation, we must first understand the source of menstruation. Although menstruation is a uterine discharge, its control is in the hands of the ovaries. Without ovaries, the uterus cannot produce menstruation. The ovaries are two almond-sized tissues in the lower abdomen. After a woman develops, they begin to function, creating a follicle every month. Approximately on the fourteenth day of the menstrual cycle, this follicle matures and automatically ruptures, releasing an egg cell from inside. This ruptured follicle becomes the corpus luteum. The corpus luteum has the effect of maintaining pregnancy. If sperm and egg do not meet at this time, it will also automatically disappear after fourteen days. Then comes the menstrual period. This creates a twenty-eight-day cycle. The follicles and the corpus luteum each have their own endocrine hormones to manage the uterine tissue and regulate the menstrual cycle. An ovary that loses its normal function will affect menstruation.</p>
<p>However, the mechanism of menstruation is not so simple, because the ovaries have a close relationship with other endocrine glands, especially the pituitary gland and the thyroid gland. A disordered endocrine system can affect the function of the ovaries, indirectly disrupting menstruation.</p>
<p>General Phenomena of Menstruation</p>
<p>A normal woman should have regular menstruation. The average is once every twenty-eight days. But few women are absolutely accurate. A difference of two or three days is not considered abnormal. The duration of menstruation also varies from person to person. Menstruation for two to six days is normal. Attention should be paid to a duration that is too long or too short.</p>
<p>Menstruation is a type of blood that does not easily clot. The amount of blood is a very difficult thing to measure, especially since it varies from person to person. From indirect evidence, we infer that normal women excrete thirty to one hundred and twenty milliliters of menstrual blood each time. Too much or too little is often an indication of disease. Many people think that menstruation is a filthy thing, and it does not matter if a little more flows out. But if five milliliters are taken from their blood vessels, they would be afraid of anemia. This is indeed a wrong view. Five milliliters of blood cannot harm a person, but a large amount of menstrual flow will undoubtedly cause anemia.</p>
<p>Some women have no abnormal feelings during menstruation. But many women experience one or more discomforts. The most common is dysmenorrhea. According to statistics in the United States, almost half of women experience this, although the degree of pain varies. The treatment of dysmenorrhea is not simple, because it has many causes. Almost half of primary dysmenorrhea can be cured by a simulated pregnancy.</p>
<p>Other symptoms such as headaches, bloating, fatigue, irritability, and breast swelling are also common.</p>
<p>The Beginning and End of Menstruation</p>
<p>The age at which a woman first menstruates varies, and it often varies from person to person and from place to place. The average age is between twelve and sixteen years old. In hotter places, menstruation occurs earlier; in colder places, menstruation occurs later. Chinese women usually begin menstruating at the age of fourteen or fifteen. It is necessary to consult a doctor if menstruation has not started after this age.</p>
<p>On average, a woman's menstruation lasts for about thirty years. It stops around the age of forty-five. Of course, there are exceptions. According to general statistics, we know that women who menstruate early have a later menopause; women who menstruate late will have an earlier menopause.</p>
<p>Menopause is not a sudden phenomenon. It often takes several months to three years to reach the stage of complete cessation of menstruation. During the transition period, menstruation is often irregular, with the cycle either shortened or prolonged. The amount of menstrual flow may also increase or decrease. This period requires close attention, because potentially fatal uterine cancer often occurs during this period, and its symptoms are the same as those described above.</p>
<p>During the transitional period of menopause, many people feel a variety of discomforts. The most common are mental and circulatory instability, such as pessimism, irritability, fatigue, a feeling of slight heat, and intermittent flushing. A large amount of leucorrhea also often occurs during this period. These are not serious situations, but they add to many life's troubles. Treatment is not difficult, and an appropriate amount of estrogen can solve everything.</p>
<p>Causes of Amenorrhea</p>
<p>Amenorrhea is different from menopause. The latter is an inevitable physiological process, while the former is a sign of pregnancy or illness.</p>
<p>In women of reproductive age, amenorrhea is often an indication of pregnancy. But we cannot say that every woman with amenorrhea is pregnant. There are many other situations that can cause amenorrhea.</p>
<p>Emotional stimuli (such as extreme anger, sadness, joy, tension, and fright) and environmental changes (such as travel, relocation, and changes in climate) are possible causes. These do not require special treatment. Menstruation will often return to normal on its own.</p>
<p>Various diseases such as tuberculosis, pneumonia, and typhoid fever often cause amenorrhea, because these diseases lower health. Women with weakened constitutions will experience amenorrhea. Therefore, the goal of treatment is to strengthen the constitution.</p>
<p>Vaginal obstruction is mostly caused by an imperforate hymen, commonly known as "stone maiden." These women do not not have menstruation, but the exit of menstruation is blocked. The diagnosis of this situation is very obvious. The treatment, of course, is to remove the obstruction.</p>
<p>Imbalance of the endocrine system is also a very common cause. Changes in the main endocrine glands such as the pituitary gland, thyroid gland, and ovaries can all affect menstruation to the point of amenorrhea. An underdeveloped uterus cannot produce menstruation, because the endocrine glands have not given it the ability to grow into an adult uterus. In women suffering from malignant goiter, amenorrhea is a very common accompanying condition. So far, the endocrine system is still an incompletely understood science, so treatment is most difficult.</p>
<p>Irregular Menstruation</p>
<p>It is difficult for the average person to distinguish between irregular menstruation and uterine bleeding. There are two causes of true irregular menstruation: one is endocrine system dysfunction, and the other is uterine fibroids. The problem of endocrine amenorrhea has been mentioned earlier. Under different degrees of dysfunction, these endocrine glands do not cause amenorrhea, but cause irregular menstruation. Uterine fibroids can change the structure of the uterus. The uterus is the source of menstruation, so menstruation is disrupted. The success of treatment depends on the accuracy of the diagnosis, especially to distinguish it clearly from the following situations of uterine bleeding:</p>
<p>(1) Pregnancy complications, such as miscarriage, placenta previa, retained placenta, and hydatidiform mole.</p>
<p>(2) Uterine inflammation, such as cervicitis, endometritis, and salpingitis.</p>
<p>(3) Malignant uterine tumors, such as cervical cancer and endometrial cancer.</p>
<p>(4) Oophoritis and ovarian tumors.</p>
<p>Hygiene During Menstruation</p>
<p>Menstrual belts with soft and absorbent materials are most suitable. Normal use should be limited to external use. Except for short periods of time for convenience, methods of placement in the vagina should be avoided.</p>
<p>It is best to take a hot shower during menstruation, in order to avoid bath water from entering the vagina and uterus and causing inflammation. Prolonged hot sitz baths are not suitable, because they can increase local congestion, thereby increasing the amount of discharge. Cold water baths and swimming should be prohibited, as they may cause sudden cessation of menstruation and chronic lower abdominal discomfort.</p>
<p>Exercise during menstruation is not necessarily inappropriate. However, fatigue and strenuous exercise should be avoided. Especially since many women feel uncomfortable during this period. Such women should rest more.</p>
<p>Sexual intercourse should be avoided during menstruation, as it may also transmit germs. However, its danger is not as serious as commonly imagined.</p>
<h3 id="e165">The Battle Between Humans and Germs (10) <a href="#e165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>— Qiao Shumin</p>
<p>Excerpted from "Infectious Disease Management"</p>
<p>Eradication of Harmful Insects</p>
<p>Insects that are most likely to transmit diseases are mainly: (1) flies (especially houseflies), (2) mosquitoes (especially malarial mosquitoes), (3) lice (especially body lice), and (4) fleas (especially rat fleas). They reproduce in large numbers in the natural world, making it difficult for us to completely eradicate them at present. However, by following the methods below, we can achieve a significant inhibitory effect.</p>
<p>A. Eradicating Flies - The breeding grounds of flies are mainly human and animal feces, as well as garbage and filth containing decaying plants. The best strategy for eradicating flies is to prevent their breeding and eliminate their larvae. As for preventing and eradicating adult flies, it is more difficult.</p>
<p>(1) Preventing Fly Breeding and Eliminating Larvae</p>
<p>(1) Centralized and rational disposal of human and animal excrement and garbage.</p>
<p>(2) Regular cleaning of excrement and garbage.</p>
<p>(3) Killing fly larvae.</p>
<p>B. Preventing and Eradicating Flies</p>
<p>(1) Use screens, curtains, and covers to prevent flies from entering.</p>
<p>(2) Use fly swatters and flypaper to kill flies.</p>
<p>(3) Use chemicals to kill flies: such as DDT, pyrethrum, etc.</p>
<p>B. Eradicating Mosquitoes - Mosquitoes breed exclusively in places with water. However, there are many places with water, both in rural and urban areas, indoors and outdoors, making it extremely difficult to completely eradicate mosquitoes. However, the species of mosquitoes that can transmit diseases are not too numerous. In China, the *Anopheles* mosquito, which transmits malaria, is the main concern. The number of species already discovered varies from province to province, totaling twenty-four species and seven subspecies. The breeding grounds and living habits of various *Anopheles* mosquitoes differ. To eradicate *Anopheles* mosquitoes, one should first investigate which species of *Anopheles* mosquito is transmitting malaria in the local area, where its breeding grounds are, and what its habits are. Then, proceed with a planned eradication, so as not to work in vain and spend money with little effect.</p>
<p>There are many methods for eradicating mosquitoes. It is important to constantly assess the local situation and choose appropriate methods. The main points of mosquito eradication methods are as follows:</p>
<p>A. Preventing Mosquito Breeding and Eliminating Larvae</p>
<p>(1) Draining stagnant water.</p>
<p>(2) Filling in depressions and covering water storage containers.</p>
<p>(3) Killing mosquito larvae: using chemical agents.</p>
<p>B. Preventing and Eradicating Adult Mosquitoes</p>
<p>(1) Use mosquito nets, screens, and curtains to prevent mosquitoes from entering. A mesh with sixteen holes per inch is sufficient to prevent *Anopheles* mosquitoes.</p>
<p>(2) Use mosquito swatters to kill mosquitoes, or use livestock as a decoy - some *Anopheles* mosquitoes prefer the blood of livestock to human blood.</p>
<p>(3) Use chemicals to kill or repel mosquitoes: such as DDT, etc.</p>
<p>C. Eradicating Lice - Lice are external parasites of the human body and can transmit diseases such as relapsing fever, typhus, and trench fever. If we can bathe and change clothes frequently and maintain cleanliness, lice will not be able to establish themselves on the human body. However, due to the poor socio-economic conditions in general, the difficulty of water supply in the southwest, northwest, Mongolia, and Tibet, and the difficulty of maintaining cleanliness in some military units and prisons, lice are very common. Improving cleanliness is a fundamental solution. Methods for eradicating lice as a temporary measure can be divided into two categories: head lice and body lice.</p>
<p>A. Eradicating Head Lice</p>
<p>(1) Shave the hair.</p>
<p>(2) Comb to remove fleas - Lice eggs adhere to the hair. They can first be washed with diluted borax water or Lysol to eliminate them.</p>
<p>(3) Use chemicals to kill them - D.D.T. preparations are very effective.</p>
<p>B. Eradicating Body Lice - Body lice attach themselves to clothing and bedding. After bathing and changing into new clothes, the body will be free of lice. However, bedding and other items should be treated to kill insects to avoid future problems. Generally, heat or chemicals are used to kill them.</p>
<p>C. Eradicating Fleas - Among fleas, rat fleas are the most dangerous. To eradicate rat fleas, rats should also be exterminated at the same time (see previous section) for effective results. DDT preparations can be used to eradicate fleas, with very good results.</p>
<p>Enhancing Resistance</p>
<p>It is difficult to completely suppress the source of infectious diseases. The routes of transmission may not all be cut off, especially for respiratory infectious diseases. Therefore, enhancing the body's resistance is the last and most important line of defense for us to overcome germs. This can be divided into two categories: strengthening general resistance and developing specific resistance.</p>
<p>(9) Strengthening General Resistance - Improving Nutrition and General Health</p>
<p>A. Resisting the Invasion of Germs - We already know that the main routes of germs invading the human body are the mucous membranes, skin, and insect vectors. The skin can be kept intact, and insects do not belong to the human body, so there is no need to discuss them. Only the mucous membranes (respiratory tract, digestive tract, etc.) are always the main gates for germs to invade. How can we prevent and block them, so that germs cannot establish themselves on the mucous membranes or penetrate the mucous membranes and invade? Unfortunately, people's research in this area is still insufficient. What is known is that good nutrition, especially a sufficient amount of vitamin A, is related to the local resistance of the mucous membranes, and the removal of lesions (such as tonsillitis, etc.) is sufficient to restore the original reduced resistance of the mucous membranes.</p>

<p>Spring and Autumn</p>
<h3 id="e166">English Translation of Fan Chengda's Poems <a href="#e166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>— Zhao Jingshen</p>
<p>Fan Chengda's "Four Seasons of Rural Life," a collection of sixty poems by the Southern Song pastoral poet, has recently been translated into English by Gerald Bullett. The small book is titled "The Golden Year of Fan Cheng-Ta," published by Cambridge University Press in England, and is said to be "a translation of Chinese agricultural procedures into rhyming English poetry." Because the original poems are arranged in seasonal order, with twelve poems each for rural life in spring, late spring, summer, autumn, and winter, and each poem is a seven-character quatrain. It is accompanied by annotations by Zhu Xi (? Tsui Chi) and calligraphic decorations. Perhaps the original Chinese text or titles were also written by Zhu Xi and printed using a plate? A. Waley's translation of Li Bai's poems adds the Chinese titles on the side.</p>
<p>Fan Chengda served as the prefect of Mingzhou in the twelfth century, which is now Yinxian County in Zhejiang. The reviewer for the London Times Literary Supplement said that he had served as "the military governor of Sichuan, gathered many poets and employed them, and he himself was the greatest poet among them." That is probably confusing Fan Chengda with Lu You, isn't it? The article also said: "This was written by Fan Chengda at the age of sixty, when he retired from office and was in leisure." According to the preface to the poems: "In the Bingwu year of Chunxi, after a slight relief from a long illness, I returned to my old retreat in Lake Stone, and wrote poems based on events in the countryside," resulting in sixty poems throughout the year, titled "Four Seasons of Rural Life." The Bingwu year of Chunxi corresponds to 1186 in the Western calendar. He was born in 1126. According to the Western way of calculating age, he could be said to be sixty years old, while the Chinese way of calculating age would be sixty-one. This cannot be considered a mistake.</p>
<p>Bullett himself says that his translation of the poems is based on experience. He has introduced to the English-speaking world Fan Chengda's clear and beautiful textual paintings of the agricultural year. What he has introduced to them are the phenomena of the four seasons, the various residents and customs of the countryside. He speaks with great enthusiasm and sincerity, and he focuses more on food than English and American pastoral poets.</p>
<p>Because of Fan Chengda's meticulous study of nature, he created his extraordinary poetic style. The reviewer believes that it is impossible not to introduce a little of it. Fan Chengda can turn anything into delightful poetic material. The following poem can serve as a representative work of Chinese agricultural life:</p>
<p>"In the midst of many acres of lotus flowers,</p>
<p>I row my boat, releasing the oars.</p>
<p>What obscures the path is a pile of flowers,</p>
<p>Until evening I forgot to go home.</p>
<p>The people waiting there are very clear</p>
<p>Although they cannot see where the boat is.</p>
<p>There, they always look there,</p>
<p>A small water bird suddenly startled and flies up."</p>
<p>In fact, these eight lines of poetry are only four lines in the original Chinese, found in the tenth of the "Rural Life in Summer" poems:</p>
<p>"Thousands of acres of lotus, I loosen the oars and play,</p>
<p>Flowers deep, I lose my way, forgetting to return late.</p>
<p>My family knows where the boat is going,</p>
<p>Sometimes there are startled little ducks flying."</p>
<p>Not long after the May Fourth Movement, Ye Shaojun, Gu Jiegang, and Wang Boxiang, three people from Suzhou, jointly compiled a textbook for introductory Chinese language (this is what is called Suzhou people speaking Mandarin, a joke). They first selected more than ten poems from Fan Chengda's sixty poems, breaking the former practice of only selecting classical prose. Later, people followed suit, and various textbooks adopted them, so middle school students also had the opportunity to appreciate the poems of this pastoral poet. Now that Bullett has translated them into English, it can be said that the poems of Lake Stone have become more widespread, and even English and American people know about them. Because before this, A. Waley's translation of "One Hundred and Seventy Poems," H. Giles's translation of "Gems of Chinese Literature," and Fletcher's translation of "Selections from Tang Poetry" and "Further Selections from Tang Poetry" all paid special attention to poets of the Tang Dynasty and before, and rarely paid attention to Fan Chengda.</p>
<h3 id="e167">On Simple Living <a href="#e167" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c167" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">167</a></h3>
<p>— Xi Xi</p>
<p>A thesis was published in the bustling city of Paris in the late nineteenth century, specifically discussing simple living. At that time, it was already felt that world civilization had gone too far, and to return to simple living was simply foolish and insensitive. However, the author of this book thought otherwise. According to his meaning, simplicity is the practice of moving towards the highest goal of life, and not running counter to reality. Modern life, from the moment of birth to the moment of death, is constantly in intense tension, binding itself. Even games have no true joy, and even death cannot be peaceful. Especially the wealthy class is driven and manipulated by vanity, ambition, and abnormal enjoyment, which is truly pitiful. It is true that one must struggle for food and clothing, but what is the purpose of bustling and disturbing oneself beyond what is necessary? He put forward several items: simple thoughts, simple words, simple desires, simple entertainment, and simple aesthetics. It is truly like a clear, sweet, and gentle spring gushing out in the street of paper drunk and gold obsessed, washing away people's dusty feelings.</p>
<p>Who is the author? Charles Wagner. He was born in 1852 in Alsace, which was later merged by Germany and then returned. He was raised in a religious family, in a beautiful natural environment. He himself often said that wild flowers, mountain birds, white stones, and flowing springs were the fishing grounds of his childhood that he could never forget. He lost his father early, and at the age of fourteen went to Paris to study. After graduating, he went to Germany for further studies and was greatly influenced by German philosophers. After the annexation of Alsace, he devoted himself to French language and literature. He was engaged in religious education, lecturing, and writing throughout his life, diligently and tirelessly. His profound observations benefited from the experience of suddenly entering the city from the countryside in his childhood, and his sincere sympathy benefited from his inherited faith. Therefore, his discussion of the various falsehoods, changes, obsessions, and sufferings in the human world has a keen understanding, and he expresses it with a gentle and honest nature, issuing kind and moving exhortations, not arbitrarily criticizing people, but giving people lively warmth. He sympathized with the working class and was suspected of organizing and gathering workers, but he did not believe that opposing forces could not be reconciled. He once had the following famous saying:</p>
<p>"I am very fortunate that in my soul, I can reconcile many seemingly opposing forces into one. I live with the poor and the rich, the wise and the foolish, the city people and the villagers, the believers and the atheists, the Germans and the French, the people of the past and the people of the present. I understand them all, and I love them all equally."</p>
<p>In the preface to this masterpiece, he said:</p>
<p>"Those who suffer from fever dream of immersing themselves in the joy of a sweet spring. Modern life is so tense and disturbed that one should also dream of simple living. Simple living is not created by the external environment, nor is it a thing of the past. Rather, it can be a more lively and varied life, so it can be taken as the highest goal of life. Although our way of life is different from our ancestors, the spirit is the same. What exactly are people seeking in life? Today is still the same as yesterday! It is a pity that we are misled by divergent paths, resulting in self-inflicted troubles."</p>
<p>In his first chapter, discussing the troubles of the dusty world, he has a very humorous description.</p>
<p>"A certain lady is scheduled to get married on Tuesday. Today is already Friday. Tailors, dressmakers, house decorators, caterers, jewelry sellers, all kinds of people, are coming and going. It is hard to arrange things properly, and then you have to rush to change clothes and attend various ceremonies and banquets. (According to French customs, there are things similar to our old customs, such as betrothal gifts, etc.) Returning late at night, exhausted, there is another pile of letters waiting to be opened. Some are congratulatory, some say that the things entrusted are too late, and some say that it is difficult for the best man or master of ceremonies to fulfill their duties. There are various kinds of letters, enough to make one laugh, and enough to make one hesitate. This situation has been going on for almost a month, and there is simply no moment of peace and rest. Alas! Isn't this living in hell? Fortunately, the old grandmother is nearly eighty years old. She has her own bedroom, and she has suffered all the troubles of life and can now sit quietly to spend her remaining years. The chaos of this family temporarily disappears at the door of her room. Because everyone is afraid of disturbing her old lady, they have to speak and walk quietly. A pair of newlyweds finally managed to hide in the old lady's room, only then breathing a sigh of relief. The old lady said: "Poor children! You are too tired. Rest for a while, talk to each other, don't worry about those meaningless things, they are not worth it. This world is too complicated, it cannot add happiness to people, it only makes people more worried! "These words truly make the pair of newlyweds feel like they have been awakened by a morning bell. Indeed, in the past few days, they almost affected their love for a trivial matter, and it was not just once!</p>
<p>Who can not sympathize with the pain of the couple who are getting married and are entangled in the customs of vanity?</p>

<h3 id="e169">Feng Menglong's "Extensive Collection of Jokes" <a href="#e169" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c169" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">169</a></h3>
<p>— Fu Jun</p>
<p>There are indeed many joke books in our country since ancient times. Starting from the earliest two joke books: "Laughing Forest" by Handan Chun of the Later Han Dynasty and "Record of Opening Smiles" attached to Hou Bai, there have been more than dozens of them up to the present. However, among these dozens of joke books, Feng Menglong's "Extensive Collection of Jokes" of the Ming Dynasty is the most impressive. Whether in terms of compilation or the selection of materials, Feng Menglong's joke book is the most in line with our ideals.</p>
<p>Feng Menglong's pen name is Mo Han Xiao Zhuren. The Jinxia Pavilion edition of "Extensive Collection of Jokes" is signed with this name. It is listed as the seventh kind of the first collection of the National Studies Treasure Text Library, published in the 25th year of the Republic of China. The preface to "Extensive Collection of Jokes" says: "From ancient times to the present, it is all talk, and talk is all laughter. The mixed beginnings and opening of the two instruments, the abdication and conquests of the successive sages, who sees them? It is also just talk. Later talk about the present is just like present talk about the past. To talk about it and doubt it is laughable. To talk about it and believe it is also laughable. The history of the canonical texts is ghost talk, and they are competing to spread it. Poems and essays are light talk, and they are competing for excellence. Praise, criticism, expansion, and suppression are chaotic talk, and they are competing to advance. Some laugh at people, some are laughed at by people. Those who laugh at people are also laughed at by people, and those who are laughed at by people also laugh at people. When will people stop laughing at each other? "Extensive Collection of Jokes" is a collection of jokes. Thirteen volumes are still considered thin. If you read it and like it, please don't like it. If you read it and get angry, please don't get angry. Yao and Shun, you abdicate the throne. I laugh at Tang and Wu, you seize the throne. He said that there was no one nearby to watch. If you see through this meaning, it is just a small business at the crossroads. What are Long Bi, Peng Gan, Yi He, and Lu? What are Chao Fu, Xu You, Yi, and Qi? Just like this chattering, I don't have the time to laugh at you. I laugh at Lao Tzu's five thousand words of Tao Te Ching, I laugh at Sakyamuni's five thousand volumes of text. It only provokes those Taoist priests to beat the cloud gongs, and the monks to beat the wooden fish, making a poor living. What kind of green ox reason and white ox taste have they ever had? Strangely, it provokes that Dharma old stinky Hu to chew and chew and wash and wash these dregs of dried dung. I also laugh at that old man Confucius, you chatter about what is thorough learning and writing, and you also kill many living people for nothing. I also laugh at Zhang Daoling and Xu Jingyang, even if you ascend to heaven in broad daylight, what is the use? These unfinished spirits in the end are just a bunch of wronged ghosts. Stop, stop, stop! There is also a great laughing palace of the ancient and modern world. You and I are all in it as talking points. Without talking, one cannot become a person. Without laughing, one cannot become talk. Without laughing, talking cannot become a world. The Laughing Buddha, my teacher, my teacher, inscribed by the Mo Han Zhai master."</p>
<p>"Extensive Collection of Jokes" is divided into fourteen volumes. The first thirteen volumes are jokes, and the last volume is called "Hidden Talk," which is "riddles," and is actually an appendix to the book. Volume 1, "Confucian Admonitions," contains 49 articles; Volume 2, "Official Admonitions," contains 27 articles; Volume 3, "Nine Schools," contains 23 articles; Volume 4, "Beyond the World," contains 15 articles; Volume 5, "Appetite," contains 68 articles; Volume 6, "Romantic Feelings," contains 24 articles; Volume 7, "Greed and Swallowing," contains 9 articles; Volume 8, "Emphasis on Temperament," contains 25 articles; Volume 9, "Bias and Rebuttal," contains 38 articles; Volume 10, "Mockery and Teasing," contains 41 articles; Volume 11, "Satirical Admonition," contains 19 articles; Volume 12, "Physical Form," contains 16 articles; Volume 13, "Miscellaneous Records," contains 9 articles; Volume 14, "Hidden Words," contains 39 articles. Except for Volume 14, "Hidden Words," which are "riddles" and cannot be said to be jokes, the thirteen volumes contain a total of 363 jokes. The longest jokes have as many as eighty or ninety characters per article, and the shortest are only about ten or twenty characters.</p>
<p>Concise wording and natural grammar are the characteristics of "Extensive Collection of Jokes." And every time we read an article, we not only smile, but also feel a strong sense of irony. Here are a few examples:</p>
<p>"A new official took office and asked the clerks: How should I do my job as an official? He said: Be clean in the first year, half-clean in the second year, and mixed in the third year. The official sighed and said: How can I manage to get to the third year?" (Volume 2, Official Admonitions, Article 12, "New Official Taking Office Practice")</p>
<p>"An official's birthday was celebrated. The clerks heard that he was born in the year of the rat, so they pooled gold to cast a rat as a birthday gift. The official was pleased and said: Do you know that my wife's birthday is also coming soon? My wife was born in the year of the ox." (Volume 2, Official Admonitions, Article 26, "Born in the Year of the Ox")</p>
<p>"A newly married woman was crying sadly on the way. The sedan chair carrier couldn't bear it and said: Little lady, how about I carry you back? The woman replied: I'm not crying anymore!" (Volume 6, Romantic Feelings, Article 15, "Not Crying")</p>
<p>"When a woman first left her boudoir, she was crying sadly. The sedan chair carrier couldn't find the carrying pole, so he cried and said: My lady, the carrying pole is in the corner of the door!" (Volume 6, Romantic Feelings, Article 17, "Finding the Carrying Pole")</p>
<p>After reading these jokes, how can we not say "If you read it and get angry, please don't get angry"?</p>
<p>Therefore, in my opinion, many of the short and concise jokes in Feng Menglong's "Extensive Collection of Jokes," when compared with modern so-called Western humor, are really no less than it.</p>

<p>— Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>What to do? After a little thought, I immediately ran to the car park, trying to find a small rope or something; I was going to twist the gunpowder from the pistol bullets into the rope to make a fuse, like the fuses the locals used to light beeswax. Although it wasn't possible to accurately calculate the exact moment of combustion, it would have to do. I didn't expect that after searching and searching, I just couldn't find such a thing. I hurriedly signaled, calling Hu also to help me find it.</p>
<p>Who knew that just as my younger brother Hu ran over, I suddenly heard the loudspeaker "dong, dong," sound a few times. Just as it was making a strange sound, shouting "ah, euh," at the same time, several searchlights suddenly shot out from the top of the multi-story building. The barracks on the eastern side opposite also began to stir, and in addition to the sounds of people, there were also the sounds of dogs, as if there were more than ten dogs howling softly. What was especially hateful was that wailing, ghost-like alarm, also sounded. Fortunately, none of those searchlights shone on us here.</p>
<p>In fact, we only needed to release one or two cans of gasoline to cause a big fire. But I hated the Japanese devils so much in my heart; I thought that wasting one more pool of their oil would also make their hearts ache even more. I didn't know that in doing so, we also wasted at least twenty minutes of our precious time. With these twenty minutes, we could have taken our time, probably done everything, and left already. But what was the use of regretting it now?</p>
<p>Once this alarm sounded, even the most experienced people would inevitably feel a bit frightened. In this critical moment, we absolutely couldn't make a wrong move. If we were confused, perhaps we would really have to grab a car, fire a gun, and rush out. But it hadn't reached that point yet, so I still calmed down, thought for a while, and used my eyes and ears to find out the direction of their search.</p>
<p>"Little Aunt, why are you looking for that rope? ... There are a lot of rags here, twist them into strips, ...</p>
<p>This child's mind was so agile, and his thoughts were so clear, it was really adorable. However, he didn't know that rope burns easily and is not easy to extinguish. A rope twisted from strips of cloth, even with gunpowder, would either burn too fast or easily go out; but it was still the only way, we could try it. Within three minutes, we made the fuse, picked the most suitable place, and set it up. A small pile of gunpowder was also piled up at the end of the rope. Seeing that everything was arranged properly, I took out my lighter and lit the fuse. I looked at my watch, it was exactly 10:05.</p>
<p>"Let's go!" I pointed to the west. I estimated that crossing the coal heap, traversing a section of open space, drilling through the jungle, crossing the road, going over the stone wall, and crossing that stream would take at least ten minutes.</p>
<p>"Halt ... Add!" Just as we were about to move, we suddenly heard a coarse and brutal voice shouting from behind us, like thunder.</p>
<p>The actions of the Japanese were probably almost always "deceptive." Looking here, the searchlights were all concentrated on the front of the building; the people, dogs, row after row, team after team, also walked forward along the road to the front, thinking that they were targeting the front of this garrison area, conducting a search. Although they activated all the alarm search equipment - searchlights, loudspeakers, alarm horns, people, dogs, etc., we still thought that the Japanese always liked to make a fuss over nothing, so we still concentrated on working here; who knew that this thing would pop out from here?</p>
<p>As soon as I heard the shout, my younger brother Hu and I immediately drew our guns and turned around. Who knew that the guy had a hand-held machine gun.</p>

<p>— Shao Fu</p>
<p>The season has entered early winter, and the signs of cold are gradually spreading. Thinking of this year's snowy season, my heart is heavy, and I fear there will be no shortage of problems.</p>
<p>Shanghai is blessed by nature, and a woolen sweater and an overcoat are enough to cope with the cold here. However, in Peiping, which is still within the pass but not the coldest area, the temperature is already four degrees below zero. As for beyond the pass, and in another month, it is truly unimaginable!</p>
<p>Can those of us in warmth extend a hand to help our compatriots shivering in the wind and snow? This year's winter relief efforts will not be small in scope. We must prepare as soon as possible, because by the time people are frozen stiff, relief will be too late.</p>
<p>The sudden cold is particularly stimulating. These past two days, when people meet, their greetings are almost unanimously, "It's so cold!" But in a few days, everyone will get used to it. This phenomenon certainly illustrates the human capacity to adapt to the environment, but it also shows the frightening power of habit formed over time.</p>
<p>For the timid and the lazy, it is a threat and a terror, leading to prostration, regression, decline, and inaction. But for the brave and self-reliant, it is an encouragement, a spur, and a stimulus from nature.</p>
<h3 id="e173">The Enemy of Secret Radio Stations: Radio Wave Detection Machines <a href="#e173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>— Mai Ye</p>
<p>The top headline on the city news page of this newspaper on the 21st of last month reported that the Songhu Garrison Headquarters recently used a small radio wave detection machine to uncover an illegal secret radio station on Jiangning Road.</p>
<p>Everyone knows that radio waves are merely vibrations in the "ether" that fills the universe, invisible to the eye and intangible to the touch. So, how does a "radio wave detection machine" actually detect them? The principle is easy to understand, but first, we must remember that what is usually detected is the transmitting station, not the receiving station. Fortunately, 90% of secret radio stations both receive and transmit. When they are transmitting, the "radio wave detection machine" can track the source of the radio waves like a hunting dog and eventually find the location of the transmitting station—or, more precisely, detect the location of the "antenna" connected to the transmitter. The "antenna" of a secret radio station may be disguised as a regular radio antenna, extending outdoors or on the roof, but it may also be hidden indoors, what is called an "indoor antenna."</p>
<p>Readers may recall how different radios were fifteen years ago, when radio broadcasting first appeared. At that time, the loudspeaker was not hidden inside the radio, and the antenna used, in addition to the current "outdoor antenna," also included the then-popular "indoor antenna," which consisted of a long copper wire wound around a small cross, looking rather like a spider web or our unique "Bagua Diagram." This ring-shaped "indoor antenna" had a certain mystery, because the cross was mounted on an "axis" that could be rotated left and right, so that the "Bagua Diagram" could easily be turned to face any direction of the compass. However, we must note that when rotating its direction, for a particular broadcasting station or transmitter, it only faces in one direction that the music or Morse code heard is clearest and loudest. Why? Because (according to the direction that the antenna is facing), with the location of the receiver as the origin, if one draws a straight line in the same direction on a map, then the broadcasting station or transmitter is on that straight line. The principle of the "radio wave detection machine" is similar.</p>
<p>However, using only one antenna and one receiver can only give a rough idea of where the broadcasting station or transmitter is located. In other words, at this time, one can only know that the transmitting station is on a straight line drawn on the map. Whether it is in front or behind, to the left or right of the receiving station is still unknown, because front and back, or left and right, are all on the same straight line. Thus, it is still impossible to tell exactly "which point" (location) on that "infinitely long" straight line the secret radio station is located.</p>
<p>The complete solution to the problem is very easy: simply set up a second receiving station and an antenna whose direction can be changed. Relying on the same principle, the direction of the strongest radio wave is searched for by the second antenna, and a straight line is drawn on the map through the base point of the second receiving station. The two straight lines will definitely not be "parallel." Then, according to the principles of geometry, these two lines must have an "intersection point," and the "intersection point," that is, the center of "X," is the location of the secret radio station!</p>
<p>Simply put, the so-called "radio wave detection machine" actually only includes an antenna whose direction can be rotated, and a receiver that is somewhat similar to a regular radio, except that in addition to the "earpiece," that is, the "headphones," it also has an extremely precise and sensitive "microammeter." From the pointer on this meter, one can see which direction the antenna is rotated that the received radio signal is strongest, thereby inferring in which direction the secret radio station is located.</p>
<p>Most "radio wave detection machines" used for detection have a set of instruments and an antenna installed in a small car, so it can move. Before going out to detect, the first step is to discover the "wavelength" of the secret radio station, because every legal radio station has a "wavelength" designated by the authorities, which cannot be changed privately. Also, the "wavelength" of each station is different. If the agency responsible for investigating illegal radio stations hears a radio wave "wavelength" on the receiver that is not on the registration list, it must immediately "track" it. Second, every legal radio station has a unique "call sign," just as every person has a different name, and this "call sign" is also designated by the telecommunications authority. According to regulations, the transmitting station must state its "call sign" several times at the beginning or end of a telegram to comply with international procedures. If one hears a radio station that does not "introduce itself" in this way by stating its name (i.e., "call sign"), it is undoubtedly an illegal radio station, and further "tracking" is necessary.</p>
<p>The "radio wave detection machine" is dispatched to investigate suspicious radio stations. Usually, two or three "detection machines" are dispatched separately, and they communicate with each other at any time using short-range small radios, because this can "achieve twice the result with half the effort." There are also some in which several radio wave detection machines and several rotating antennas are installed in the same small car. However, whether the car is equipped with one or more sets of instruments, the exterior of the car looks no different from ordinary cars.</p>
<p>Precise and skilled detection can sometimes uncover the location of a secret radio station in a matter of minutes, not only knowing the street, lane, and house number clearly, but also easily detecting on which floor of that building, in the front hall or the back pavilion, the secret radio station is hidden. The secret lies in changing the "angle of elevation" of the "detection machine's" antenna to obtain this information.</p>
<p>Besides the "radio wave detection machine" mentioned above that detects illegal radio stations, the use of this principle also includes guiding ships into port in thick fog by using radio wave direction, or informing lost aircraft of their location, and even guiding them to safely return to base.</p>
<p>It is said that the United States used many aircraft without pilots controlled by radio waves in its two atomic bomb tests on coral reefs. The ability of these squadrons of aircraft to fly back to base was also achieved by using radio signals to guide their direction. Also, the principle of "radar," one of the new weapons of World War II, is partly similar to the "radio wave detection machine" described here.</p>

<p>— Ge Chunliang</p>
<p>Q: How large would a square of gold have to be to weigh one ton?</p>
<p>A: A fourteen-inch square solid of gold would weigh about 1,920 pounds - just under a ton.</p>
<p>Q: Do diamonds ever fall from the sky?</p>
<p>A: Yes - it will happen sometime. This is because there is a large amount of diamond present in meteors. Several small meteorites and asteroids full of diamonds have already been found.</p>
<p>Q: Is a person heavier when moving than when standing still?</p>
<p>A: Yes, heavier when moving. For example, a person suddenly jumping up can double their weight - and that's just the weight on the scales.</p>
<p>Q: If a person is standing straight and is shot in the back of the head, in which direction will they fall?</p>
<p>A: No matter where the bullet comes from, the person will always fall forward, perhaps because the ancestors of human beings also crawled.</p>
<p>Q: When did gas (Gas) first come into use, and who first used it for lighting?</p>
<p>A: Centuries before Jesus was born, the Chinese had already used bamboo pipes to draw natural gas from salt mines and use it at home for lighting.</p>
<p>Q: Is it true that the heavier the iron used to iron clothes, the smoother the clothes will be ironed?</p>
<p>A: No, according to scientific research, a three- or four-pound iron and a seven- or eight-pound iron have the same effect. It is the temperature of the iron and the humidity of the cloth that have the effect.</p>
<p>Q: Is it true that anything can become transparent if it is made extremely thin?</p>
<p>A: Yes, a thin sheet of iron, must be one hundred thousandth of a centimeter thick, can be as transparent as glass.</p>
<p>Q: If there were no moon, would there still be tides?</p>
<p>A: Yes, if there were no moon, the sun would cause tides. In fact, the sun accounts for five-elevenths of all tides.</p>
<p>Q: Is it true that there is dust in every raindrop?</p>
<p>A: Yes, there is dust, salt, and other components necessary to make up rainwater.</p>
<p>Q: How much moisture is there in dense fog?</p>
<p>A: A rectangular volume of dense fog that is fifty feet long, twenty-five feet wide, and ten feet high would contain about one glass of water.</p>

<p>— Fan Fu</p>
<p>Mr. Zhang Daofan, Director of the Central Cultural Movement Committee, recently announced that he would abandon political activities to concentrate on art, and became a disciple of the famous painter Qi Baishi. Zhang Daofan, courtesy name Weizhi, is a native of Ran County, Guizhou. At the age of twenty, he left his hometown to study in Tianjin. In the eighth year of the Republic of China (1919), with the help of his uncle, he studied in England. At that time, Zhang was twenty-three years old. He initially studied literature in England, and later switched to calligraphy and painting, obtaining a diploma from the Fine Arts Department of the University of London. He then went to the National School of Fine Arts in France and participated in the famous "Paris Spring Art Exhibition" with his works.</p>
<p>After returning to China, Zhang's political career began immediately. At that time, the Chinese art world was still in a state of decline, making it difficult to develop his art. Not being able to practice his art was a last resort. From being the secretary of the Agricultural and Industrial Department of Guangdong Province to being the secretary and deputy minister of the Central Organization Department, the Minister of the Central Propaganda Department, and to his current position, twenty years have passed. During that time, he assisted Mr. Chen Lifu in promoting party affairs, which was very effective.</p>
<p>Mr. Zhang is humble and sincere, a cultured artist. It is said that Zhang once wrote two scripts, "Self-Help" and "Self-Mistake," and solicited criticism from all walks of life. One young student wrote to Zhang, pointing out the errors in the script, concluding that Zhang was not qualified to talk about spoken drama. Zhang replied, acknowledging that the student's comments were insightful and deeply ashamed. He then published an advertisement in the newspaper, asking the student to provide his contact information so that he could ask for advice. After a month, he finally received a reply, but only if Zhang showed his sincerity would the student comply. Zhang wrote a letter according to the student's wishes, and the student then provided his address, requesting only written communication and refusing to meet. Zhang respected the student's opinion and successively mailed the written scripts to the student, who annotated them with his own opinions and mailed them back. Zhang adopted many of these suggestions. Later, he learned that the student was a poor and hard-working young man, so Zhang sent a large sum of money to help him, expressing his gratitude and encouragement.</p>
<p>Mr. Zhang not only understands Cantonese, but is also proficient in French. His wife is also a French lady. Zhang has a daughter named Liyun, who is seventeen years old this year, and is much loved by Zhang.</p>
<p>During his twenty years in politics, Mr. Zhang never ceased to care about the situation in the cultural world, and often maintained contact. In the midst of his busy schedule, he also stole time to write scripts and other literary works. Mr. Zhang is emotional and possesses a broad-mindedness that is lacking in many artists. In reason, he is more suited to being an artist.</p>
<p>Mr. Zhang's actions today are a loss in the political sense, but a welcome gain in the cultural world.</p>
<h3 id="e176">Talking About KISS <a href="#e176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>— Jiang Pingqing</p>
<p>I have searched through all the unofficial histories, anecdotes, and legends of China, seeking to find the character for "kiss," but they are as rare as morning stars. I have checked the vocabulary of modern novels, and while the character exists, it is not common. Not only that, but even if I were to wear an invisibility cloak and actually investigate the romantic behavior of Chinese men and women, apart from the occasional lazy kiss between couples hiding and dodging, or the bolder performances between adulterers and adulteresses in the lower classes, open and frank expressions of kissing are rarely seen. Even in the "kiss repository" of movies, one would expect to see a real performance, but alas, it is still just a trick of the camera! Very few Chinese films have kissing scenes, and these are influenced by foreign films.</p>
<p>Most Chinese people regard Confucius's precepts as sacred mottoes. Emotions must still be tempered by propriety and righteousness. Since ancient times, men and women should not touch each other's hands, let alone their mouths? If we were to point out a semi-enlightened young girl now and tell her to go herself, no! To see, no! To hear that a certain couple, at a banquet or on the sidewalk, press their lips together and make a "smack" sound, oh my! She would be so ashamed! So ashamed that her earlobes would blush all the way to her jaw!</p>
<p>Chinese romance is accustomed to the exchange of spiritual and mental longings. Even when they meet, they remain aloof, welcoming and rejecting each other. The most used physical feature is the eyes, and the most expressed posture is the smile. (The Chinese only have "spending a thousand gold pieces to buy a smile," but not "spending a thousand gold pieces to buy a kiss.") Everything is a transmission of souls and a connection of spirits. This noble and pure path is not to be compared with the rough-hewn style of the West.</p>
<p>In the lyrics of our Li Houzhu, there is a line: "Chewing the red velvet, she smiles and spits it out to her lover!" Just this one line! Look! The charm in this line is enough for you to describe in what way? Enough for you to savor how many times? Its meaning, its delicacy, its liveliness, is it something that you mechanically embracing, hugging, kissing and kissing, kissing and kissing, can compare to?</p>
<p>But in the books of our country, it is not impossible to find a word similar to kiss, "Let me have a whiff!" This word "whiff" is the broad sense of the word kiss, because I can sniff your cheeks, sniff your temples, or sniff at the hairline and eyebrows, but our sniff is from man to woman, not woman to man; (alas, there is no beautiful woman who will automatically come to sniff our stinky men!) Sniff! Sniff! I suddenly thought of the ugliness of the two fools pursuing Qiuxiang in Mr. Cheng Zhanlu's "The Tale of the Four Talents of Tang, Zhu, Wen and Zhou," and I couldn't help but burst into laughter.</p>
<p>The Story of the Psychoanalyst</p>
<h3 id="e177">The Innocent Murderer 3 <a href="#e177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>— Xu Guiting</p>
<p>When Luson first met Mi En, his behavior was very strange. He took out a golden cigarette case from his pocket and said to Mi En, "I stole this from a shop on Regent Street. I suddenly liked this thing, so I stole it. Didn't you know I would steal things?"</p>
<p>Mi En nodded and said, "Oh, I knew that. The cane you're holding is the 'poker' from my place. You accidentally took it away."</p>
<p>"Really?" Luson's face turned red, and he said awkwardly, "I swear, I have one of those at home too."</p>
<p>"Forget it. It's getting late. I want to know some things about you. Are your parents still alive?" "They're both dead." "Please tell me more about it." "My father was a lawyer." Luson paused, closed his eyes, and then laughed absentmindedly before continuing, "My mother was his wife."</p>
<p>The next day, Mi En returned the cigarette case that Luson stole to a shop on Regent Street.</p>
<p>The next time, Luson came again. Mi En took a syringe from the medicine cabinet, filled it with saline, and said to him, "I want to get you to talk more, so I'll quickly inject you with this saline. After the injection, you will feel slightly dizzy, but you may not fall asleep immediately."</p>
<p>So, Mi En injected Luson. Then, Mi En counted one, two, three, four... until seventy, Luson began to get confused. The psychoanalyst calmly urged him to speak, saying, "Hey! Talk! The last time, you were piloting the Spitfire, and below were the Japanese devils. So, what happened?"</p>
<p>Upon hearing this, Luson suddenly shouted loudly, "It's on fire! I must calm down, calm down. I have to parachute down. I don't know how long I stayed on top of the tree. After waking up, I climbed down at great risk. Somehow, I lost consciousness. When I regained consciousness, I opened my eyes and saw many Japanese devils surrounding me. I don't know how they suddenly appeared. A burly devil struck my waist with the butt of a gun, and I fell down. Later, they took my water bottle and wouldn't give me a drop of water. They were still surrounding me, grinning non-stop. At that time, I passed out again.</p>
<p>"When I woke up, the Japanese interpreter smiled at me, and then gave me a cigarette. He said that he had lived in London for five years. I found his condescending attitude unbearable. He always asked me, asking all sorts of irrelevant questions, such as how old I was, whether I was married, and so on. Later, two other devils got impatient with the questioning. One punched me in the face, and the other hit my waist with the butt of his gun. I screamed and fell down again. I really couldn't take it anymore, so I finally told them."</p>
<p>Mi En immediately asked, "You told them what?"</p>
<p>Luson held his face in his hands, his whole body trembling, and stuttered, "Our air force unit, where it was stationed, where it came from, our mission, our activities, everything."</p>
<p>His voice grew louder and louder, eventually becoming a shrill scream. He ended up passing out, burying his head in the sofa and crying bitterly. Mi En quickly comforted him, saying, "It's okay, have some water."</p>
<p>After a while, Luson woke up, looked around, and said, "What exactly did I say?" Mi En told him everything. He took a breath, smoked a cigarette, and continued to describe his terrifying experience:</p>
<p>"Later, those Japanese devils felt satisfied, but they still didn't let me go, fearing that I would escape. One morning, they walked into my shed. One of them was holding a wooden stick, and the other used a piece of wood to prop up one of my legs, and then struck my knee with it. Oh God! I screamed, and it was over." (To be continued)</p>

<p>National Assembly Inauguration Anniversary Special</p>
<h3 id="e178">Wishing the National Assembly a Smooth Progression <a href="#e178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>— From Our Newspaper's Archives</p>
<p>The convening of the National Assembly was decided at the Political Consultative Conference in January of this year to be held in Nanjing on May 5th. The Central Government meticulously prepared, specially appointing Shao Lizi as the Chairman of the National Assembly Preparatory Committee. By mid-April, preparations were largely complete. The National Government issued an order for the assembly, stipulating that representatives from various regions should begin reporting from April 25th. Chairman Chiang invited the Comprehensive Group of the Political Consultative Conference to a tea party on April 15th, requesting that each party submit its list of National Assembly representatives by April 20th. However, by April 24th, the lists from the various parties had still not been submitted, and the Communist Party of China (CPC) representatives reiterated that they could not consider the matter. At 4 PM on the 24th, Chairman Chiang once again invited representatives from various parties of the Political Consultative Conference and prominent social figures to a tea party at the National Government to discuss the National Assembly issue and other related matters. As a result, in order to consider the facts and respect the opinions of the various parties, it was decided to temporarily postpone the session and, at the same time, hope that all parties would expedite the consultative work in order for the National Assembly to be held as soon as possible.</p>
<p>After the postponement order was issued, the first group of 130 National Assembly representatives who had already arrived in Nanjing initially expressed opposition, telegraphing Chongqing and arguing that even if the CPC and the Democratic League did not submit representatives, the National Assembly should still be held as scheduled. Subsequently, National Assembly representatives from various regions arrived in Nanjing one after another, unanimously striving for the National Assembly not to be postponed, and on May 1st, they convened a preparatory meeting on their own. More than 200 representatives attended, with Lin Hu from Guizhou Province serving as the temporary chairman, jointly expressing that even if the National Assembly was postponed, there should be a definite limit. On May 6th, government representative Shao Lizi hosted a tea party for the National Assembly representatives at the Central Auditorium, elaborating on the government's difficulties and sincerely persuading the representatives to share the burden. The representatives collectively raised criticisms. By May 13th, the National Assembly Preparatory Committee finally adjourned its session, accepting Chairman Chiang's advice and establishing a steering committee to study the draft constitution.</p>
<p>The National Assembly was postponed, but the timing of its convening was not decided at the time, leading to diverse speculations, with some saying it would be in early June, others saying it would be after the autumn coolness, with no consensus. It wasn't until July 3rd, at a meeting of the Supreme National Defense Council, that Chairman Chiang raised the issue of convening the National Assembly, seeking opinions. The majority believed that it could not be delayed any longer and had to be held on a fixed date, otherwise there would be no way to gain the trust of the people. Therefore, it was decided that the National Assembly would be held on November 12th. The method of convening it was decided to proceed in accordance with the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference. If representatives from some parties did not participate at that time, the National Assembly would still be held as scheduled, and there would be no further changes.</p>
<p>After the order to convene the National Assembly on a fixed date was issued, the CPC claimed that it had no prior knowledge and would not be bound by this decision in any way. However, the government, adhering to its consistent policy of returning power to the people, made every effort to hold peace talks before the convening of the National Assembly, hoping to reach an agreement. On the one hand, the preparatory work for the National Assembly was resumed. The National Assembly Election Office officially issued a notice on September 24th, urging various parties to submit their lists, with Zhang Lisheng's name affixed, requesting that the parties submit their lists by early October. The government decided to issue the National Assembly convocation order on October 2nd.</p>
<p>On September 28th, Chairman Chiang summoned Hong Lanyou, Secretary-General of the National Assembly Preparatory Committee, to inquire about the progress of the National Assembly's preparations. On the same day, the CPC delegation officially replied to the National Assembly Preparatory Committee, refusing to submit a list of representatives. According to the CPC's letter, "There is currently no constitution available for the National Assembly to discuss, therefore it is inconvenient to participate." The Democratic League also adopted the same stance as the CPC. On September 30th, Zhang Lan, Shen Junru, and eight others wrote to Chairman Chiang, believing that the National Assembly could only be convened after national peace was restored.</p>
<p>For the sake of thorough consideration, the convocation order, originally scheduled to be issued on October 2nd, was not issued until the 11th, when it was officially issued by the National Government's Secretariat, and simultaneously delivered to each representative, notifying them to convene as scheduled, reporting by November 2nd. After the convocation order was issued, the preparatory work in Nanjing suddenly became tense. The venue was being arranged day and night, and various reception methods were also finalized. The preparatory office specially established six reception centers to cope with the housing shortage in Nanjing. The national transportation lines also assisted in the work, providing representatives with transportation convenience.</p>
<p>At the same time, the Nanjing peace talks focused on the two themes of the National Assembly list and the ceasefire. The government side, in order to achieve constitutional government as soon as possible, urged the various parties to submit their lists of representatives as scheduled.</p>
<p>Representatives from various regions enthusiastically reported at the Social Service Center on Xin Jiekou in Nanjing from the 2nd. However, the lists of the CPC and various parties were still not submitted. The government authorities, in order to promote peaceful reunification and return power to the people, did not hesitate to make the greatest concessions. Therefore, on the 8th of this month, Chairman Chiang resolutely announced an order to stop the fighting of the national army inside and outside the pass! Wishing the National Assembly a smooth progress and the nation an unlimited future!</p>

<h3 id="e179">Impressions of the National Assembly Reception Center <a href="#e179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>— Our Newspaper's Special Correspondent</p>
<p>The National Assembly Reception Centers are divided into five locations, the most beautiful of which is of course the Second Reception Center! That is, the original Overseas Chinese Reception Center. Painted beams and carved pillars, newly painted, the red is especially red, the green is especially green, bright and dazzling, with a bit of Beijing's atmosphere. In Nanjing, where the field atmosphere is too strong, this building adds some bright touches.</p>
<p>As soon as you enter the door, there are glass counters dedicated to representatives to buy small daily necessities, arranged in two rows on the left and right. The left row is full of "American equipment", toothpaste and toothbrushes are the most, followed by cigarettes, cigars, chocolate, and the like. There are also food boxes that Shanghai has allocated to public educators. As soon as you see it, you think of those United Shopping Centers in Shanghai, the only difference perhaps is that the price of things here is two or three percent more expensive than in Shanghai. The right row of counters is all domestic products, and there are fewer types of things, nothing more than socks and towels, but a small sign on the counter is very interesting, saying that these are all domestic products, and representatives can enjoy a 10% discount on the listed price. I think this boss is very smart, because many of the representatives who live in this reception center are overseas Chinese, who have competed with foreign businessmen abroad, and their psychology of loving domestic products is naturally particularly strong. However, the business on these two rows of counters is very deserted.</p>
<p>Each reception center has some temporary facilities for the convenience of the representatives, such as temporary post offices, telegram long-distance telephones, savings and remittances, and also accepts the representatives' entrustment to handle various matters - from booking hotel rooms to booking theater tickets. According to the staff of the reception center, this part of the work is the busiest. I may also mention a very good way to deliver letters here, which Shanghai can imitate in the future. That is, the temporary post office has set up a system of delivering letters by machine bicycles. Senders do not need to affix stamps. The post office sends postmen by machine bicycles to deliver them throughout the city several times a day. The postage is always paid by the reception center according to the weight.</p>
<p>However, if you want to visit a representative, it is not easy, because there are armed military police at every corner of the stairs, with a frosty look on their faces, which makes you retreat. It is useless to take out your business card, you must go downstairs to find the staff of the office to go up together. When the staff takes you up, the military police will salute you when you go up and salute you when you come down. Hu Shih and Fu Sinian are both National Assembly representatives. If they are asked to live in such a place, I don't know what they would think?</p>
<p>Each representative is given two towels by the conference, but there are no toothbrushes or toothpaste. The conference provides white porcelain washbasins and shoe shining services.</p>
<p>The representatives' rooms are like student dormitories, with five or six people living in each room, so there is not much room for maneuvering. There are also about 200 representatives living in the hotel, and the rooms are all booked by the reception center. If you live in the Central Hotel or the like, it will be a little more comfortable - so the staff of the reception center are on the phone all day long to ask for rooms from various hotels. At present, the total number of representatives living in various reception centers is about six or seven hundred.</p>
<p>The Central Political University of Hongzhilang is the first reception center. The road is narrow and uneven, and it is very uncomfortable to sit in the car. However, most of the representatives live here. Because the Overseas Chinese Reception Center is only for overseas Chinese representatives and regional representatives from Guangdong and Guangxi.</p>
<p>Mr. Zhu Pinsan, the person in charge of the reception center, said that when the representatives of various parties come, we still have houses, and we can immediately establish several more reception centers.</p>
<p>The representatives live in the same room with their fellow villagers in principle. Not many Shanghai representatives live in the reception center. In a very small room, I saw four or five rather fat representatives, all wearing sky blue satin robes and black vests, wearing leggings, shaving their heads, with mustache, and elegant salutes, it can be seen that they must have come from some country of etiquette.</p>
<p>There is only one overseas Chinese representative from South Korea, and he lives alone in a room. This old gentleman is Mr. Zhou Shenjiu, originally from Shandong, who has lived in South Korea for thirty or forty years. Talking about the oppression of overseas Chinese by the Japanese in the past, I can't help but feel emotional, but the current situation seems to be still somewhat far from ideal. The most noteworthy sentence is: The Japanese are still painstakingly trying to influence the local authorities, and they are doing everything they can. South Korea is now a US military defense zone, and the order is relatively good, but overseas Chinese are still in a state of being unattended - the delegation remains in North China and does not enter, and the consul general has not yet left.</p>
<p>Representatives spend more time going out to visit the capital during the day. The footprints of the National Assembly representatives are all over Nanjing City, and many restaurants and restaurants are posted with "National Assembly Representatives Special Restaurant". If we follow the example of "Victory Fast Food" and "New Fortune Rice", there should be "National Assembly Representative Rice". In fact, the set meal that the representatives eat in the reception center may be regarded as "National Assembly Representative Rice". If one person eats it, they can eat a stir-fried dish, a cold dish, and a soup, but the diameter of the pot for serving the dish probably does not exceed five inches. According to the meaning of the canteen boss, the business is very good, and the business may get better in the future.</p>
<p>Do you want to ask me about my impression of the National Assembly Reception Center? Very simple: the staff are extremely busy; the representatives are extremely idle. (13th)</p>
<h3 id="e180">Mr. Lou Tongsun Discusses the Draft Constitution <a href="#e180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>— Our Newspaper's Special Correspondent</p>
<p>The emergence of the National Assembly is the harbinger of China's democratic politics. The guarantee of the democratic system in the future lies in the confirmation of the constitution. Therefore, a long time ago, many people have been enthusiastically discussing the issue of the draft constitution. The Legislative Yuan has been fiercely debating these days on how to revise or supplement the May 5th Constitution. On the one hand, Chairman Chiang has ordered the Legislative Yuan to submit the draft constitution within a limited time. Therefore, how to revise or supplement the May 5th Constitution is not only the focus of discussion among political figures, but also the concern of compatriots all over the country. Therefore, the reporter specially visited Mr. Lou Tongsun, the original drafter of the May 5th Constitution draft, to solicit his opinions on revising or supplementing the draft constitution. Mr. Lou met the reporter in his study with the calm attitude of a scholar and frankly stated his personal opinions on the revision of the draft constitution.</p>
<p>He said: The May 5th Constitution has been announced for ten years. It is true that due to the passage of time, there are inevitably some places that need to be readjusted. Especially regarding the section on provinces (Chapter 5, Section 1), not only are the articles simple (a total of only five articles), but the status and nature of the provinces are not very clear. Compared with the political situation at the time of drafting the articles, there have obviously been major changes in the current situation. In order to adapt to the current situation and implement the legacy of Sun Yat-sen's system of equal rights, there must be considerable revisions or supplements. We, the original drafters, can also frankly admit this. Other issues such as the appointment of the presidents of the Judicial and Examination Yuans, the complexity of the articles in the chapter on the national economy, especially Articles 129 and 130 at the end of the chapter, which in fact can be said to have lost their effect, and Article 143 in Chapter 8 regarding the transitional provisions on the method of generating legislators and supervisors, which should no longer exist, of course, all need to be revised, but the most important thing is that the basic principles and principles of the May 5th Constitution all strictly abide by Sun Yat-sen's legacy, have been carefully studied by the drafting committee of the Legislative Yuan for a long time, and have been publicly solicited from the people all over the country for their opinions before being announced by the National Government. For example, the organization and powers of the National Assembly are to make it truly become the organ for the people to exercise political power in the central government. Whether the president and the president of the Executive Yuan are actually held by one person or by two persons, they can only exercise one power - executive power - in the principle of the five-power constitution (so Article 56 stipulates that the president of the Executive Yuan is appointed and dismissed by the president). Although the forms of the five Yuans of administration, legislation, judiciary, examination, and supervision (whether to establish a Yuan or not) can be unfettered, they must be divided into five powers without any doubt. In recent years, a few contemporary sages have expressed many opinions on the powers of the president and the relationship between the Executive Yuan and the Legislative Yuan, and have proposed revised drafts. The main purpose is nothing more than to reduce the president's power, or even have no power at all, roughly equivalent to the president of France, and to make the Executive Yuan responsible to the Legislative Yuan, so that the Legislative Yuan is roughly equivalent to the lower house (House of Representatives) of the general national congress, and the Supervisory Yuan becomes the American-style Senate. In a word... All kinds of changes are nothing more than imitating the parliamentary politics of the United Kingdom, the United States, and France, and using the cabinet system as the central idea of the design. Frankly speaking, this is far from the spirit of Sun Yat-sen's legacy. The difficult focus of our current constitution draft issue lies here.</p>
<p>Mr. Lou is a scholar, the original drafter of the May 5th Constitution, and a political figure who has witnessed the changes in China's political situation. His frank and sincere opinions are worthy of attention by contemporary sages who are enthusiastic about discussing the constitution and compatriots who are closely concerned about the constitution.</p>
<h3 id="e181">Distinguished Guests in the Capital <a href="#e181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>— Our Newspaper's Special Correspondent</p>
<p>National Assembly representatives are now arriving in Beijing one after another to report and prepare for the meeting. The total number has reached more than 1,360, accounting for the majority of more than half of the total of 2,050. They come from different regions, represent different occupations, and even in terms of the representatives themselves, each has their own religious beliefs and lifestyle preferences. But one thing is common, that is, they are all figures who can live up to expectations and can speak for the people. These days, you can see these representatives wearing bright representative badges strolling the streets or visiting scenic spots everywhere in the capital, which can be described as "distinguished guests in the capital", a grand occasion for a while! After they arrive in Beijing, they enjoy convenience in almost all aspects of life. Many large stores also automatically posted the sign "Welcome National Assembly Representatives, Discounted Offers", willing to serve the representatives with low profits. Now let the author describe the lives of the representatives and observe them!</p>
<p>When the representatives arrive in Beijing, the first thing they will consider when they step off the transportation is the accommodation problem. "It is not easy to live in Beijing", this is something everyone knows. It is said that if the National Assembly were to be convened before the war, at least half of the representatives would live in their own private houses in Beijing or in the homes of relatives and friends in Nanjing. However, it is different now. The vast majority live in the reception centers prepared by the National Assembly Preparatory Committee. A total of five reception centers have been prepared. The first reception center is located in the Central Political School, which can accommodate more than 500 people. In order to accommodate the National Assembly representatives, the students of the Political School had to be assigned to various agencies for internships. The second reception center is in the Overseas Chinese Reception Center, which is the most magnificent and is mostly inhabited by overseas Chinese representatives. The third reception center is in Chengxian Street, which was temporarily set up by the National Assembly Preparatory Committee. The fourth reception center is in the YWCA, which can be said to be exclusively for female representatives. There is also a fifth reception center, which is located in the Land Administration Research Institute, which has a limited capacity. In total, these five reception centers can only accommodate more than 1,000 representatives. For the shortage, the Preparatory Committee has rented rooms in major hotels in the city as a supplement. Each reception center is equipped with waiters, clerks, health offices, entrusted agency offices, post offices, banks, telecommunications bureaus, reading rooms, stationery and magazine supply departments, laundry, sewing, and daily necessities supply departments. Even if the representatives want to shine their shoes, there is also a shoe shining department to serve them. As for the representatives who do not live in the dormitory, they can also receive a housing fee of 150,000 yuan.</p>
<p>The representatives' meals are also very convenient after arriving in Beijing. The Preparatory Committee provides meals from the day the representatives report to Beijing until five days after the closing of the conference. However, because the representatives have different provincial origins and different religious beliefs, it is also very inconvenient for the Preparatory Committee to prepare meals. Now the committee has agreed with 48 major restaurants in the capital that the representatives can go to eat at will with meal tickets. These 48 restaurants represent various flavors of Beijing, Cantonese, Sichuan, Halal, Pingjin, Suhu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Henan, Hunan, Fujian, vegetarian, and Western cuisine. One of them is the "Liu Huachun" Beijing restaurant in Confucius Temple, where Mrs. Chiang went to dine. Therefore, as long as you mention the three words "Liu Huachun" in the capital, there is no one who does not know this glorious history. It is said that the Mongolian and Tibetan representatives who have arrived in Beijing are not used to the dishes of these special restaurants and have taken care of their own meals.</p>
<p>Because the representatives live in different places, except for those who have private cars and can move freely, the rest of the representatives have to use the "National Assembly Special Car" to attend meetings and eat. These large special cars, a total of 60, are all painted in bright colors. As long as the representatives wear their badges, they can ride freely. There are also five traffic cars that stop at various places and run throughout the city, almost non-stop from 7:30 in the morning to 9:30 in the evening, making it very convenient to ride. The National Assembly Preparatory Committee has also ordered 20 small Jeep cars from Shanghai Xiang Sheng Company to be quickly transported to Beijing and parked near the reception centers of the representatives to provide services to the representatives at reduced fees. In this way, if the representative has any personal activities, they do not necessarily have to take the large special car.</p>
<p>Finally, I cannot but mention the staff of the National Assembly Preparatory Committee. The highest principle of their work is: "Everything is for the representatives". The scope of their work is: "All-inclusive". All things that can make the representatives comfortable and convenient are the responsibility of their preparation. According to the current count, the number of full-time transferred staff of the National Assembly has reached more than 1,000. They have never experienced such a big scene in their lives, and our country has never convened a large gathering of thousands of people, so that the current staff has an example to follow. Therefore, all preparations can only be done by imagination. Once it is found in fact that there is inconvenience, it will be modified again. This is commendable in the spirit of doing things, but whether many defects will occur after the opening of the National Assembly will have to be tested by future facts. (Letter)</p>

<h3 id="e183">Hu Shih Arrives in Nanjing <a href="#e183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>— Our Special Correspondent</p>
<p>According to Mr. Hu Shih, newspaper reporters are probably just busybodies who meddle in other people's affairs. He said, "The other day, a few of us flew to Daxiaochang Airport in Nanjing and were overjoyed to see that there wasn't a single reporter! We rushed to the registration desk to register, but to our surprise, there wasn't a single reporter at the National Assembly registration either! Later, we found out that you were all busy with your own affairs—trying to get entrance passes from the news group, weren't you?"</p>
<p>You see, if you look for him, he finds it a bother; if you don't, it seems like we reporters are being impolite. I secretly made up my mind: I'd stick to Mr. Hu like a "mushroom" for three hours!</p>
<p>Mr. Hu was wearing a long gown, looking very relaxed. He said that the National Assembly had given him three days off, and he was thinking of taking the time to read a rare edition of the "Commentary on the Water Classic." He politely took out a pack of newly opened Morris cigarettes to offer his guests. We politely declined, saying that we didn't smoke. Mr. Hu was very surprised and said, "A reporter who doesn't smoke? That's rare!"</p>
<p>Actually, everyone had cigarettes in their pockets.</p>
<p>Mr. Hu leaned comfortably on the sofa, smoke rings disappearing one by one in the quiet room, and leisurely began to talk about Peking University. Peking University officially started classes on November 4th, but the medical school had already started because it didn't have any returning students from the inland areas. This time, the new student entrance exam was announced a bit late, so the registration deadline was also a bit later, but now it's getting close, on the 15th."</p>
<p>Mr. Jing Xi published an article in the newspaper on Sunday entitled "Self-Funded Overseas Studies Must Not Be Restricted." Today, people are discussing this issue again, and I thought this was a question that Mr. Hu couldn't avoid answering, so I lightly brought it up.</p>
<p>Mr. Hu said he hadn't seen that article and didn't know what Mr. Wang had said. However, he did have some opinions on the matter of self-funded overseas studies.</p>
<p>He said that during the War of Resistance, self-funded students could apply for foreign exchange, and one US dollar was legally worth 20 yuan, so naturally, foreign living expenses seemed much lower than in China. Moreover, government-funded students could only apply for US$1,800 per year, while self-funded students could apply for US$2,400 per year, plus a travel allowance of US$2,000, totaling as much as US$4,400. As a result, everyone chose self-funded overseas studies, lived quite luxuriously, and didn't necessarily go to school, the main thing was to avoid military service. Mr. Hu said that when Germany surrendered, he was in the United States and saw self-funded students taking their whole families with them. Moreover, after Germany surrendered, gasoline became more readily available, and some of these self-funded students bought cars, bought black market gasoline, and had a great time in the United States. This situation was naturally not good.</p>
<p>However, Mr. Hu said that his usual view is that self-funded overseas studies should, in principle, not require an exam. If there is an exam, it must be very strict. Why? Because the qualifications for government-funded overseas study exams are very strict, requiring a university degree and two years of work experience, so the admitted students are mostly in their thirties. When a person reaches their thirties, their ability to learn languages is diminished.</p>
<p>Mr. Hu's conversation became more lively, and I listened quietly. I really wanted to smoke, but I was too embarrassed to. If a business card hadn't been delivered at that moment, Mr. Hu's conversation might not have been interrupted. The guest who came in was Mr. Zang Qifang, the white-bearded, spirited president of Northeastern University.</p>
<p>Mr. Hu said to Mr. Zang, "They are reporters. But they don't talk politics with me, so I'm very happy." Old Mr. Zang laughed and said, "That's right, how can you talk about politics!"</p>
<p>So, they continued to talk about overseas studies, and Mr. Zang became very interested.</p>
<p>Mr. Hu said, "Language is the most important tool for seeking knowledge. Government-funded students in their thirties, after going abroad, are sufficient in their academic fields. They get to know two or three professors and five or six classmates, and they busy themselves until they write a thesis. They don't care about the big events in society. They don't care about other people's social systems, general elections, or small elections. They are busy doing their thesis, seeking a doctoral or master's degree. In fact, the original intention of sending them out was not their degrees."</p>
<p>Mr. Zang completely agreed, saying that looking at other people's social systems is much more meaningful than focusing solely on getting a degree.</p>
<p>At this point, Mr. Hu started talking about the positive side of self-funded overseas studies. He advocated that self-funded students should be younger. He wanted to send young people around the age of twenty out so that they could study for a few more years. Because students around the age of twenty can learn languages well, and they will definitely develop a great interest in foreign culture, politics, and society. The impact they have after returning to China will be immeasurable. Therefore, if there are young children in the family who can be nurtured, it may be worthwhile to let them study at a domestic university for a year or two first, and then go to a foreign university as transfer students. People over the age of twenty-five really shouldn't learn languages anymore, and those who study sociology, literature, and history must also go abroad early.</p>
<p>Government-funded exams are strictly limited, and it's not easy for younger people to pass, so it's better to loosen up on self-funded students—but, of course, there will definitely be many drawbacks. Mr. Hu said that if there must be an exam, then it must be strict, at least to get good students.</p>
<p>Mr. Zang said that it's not good for overseas students to be unsupervised abroad, so should we send someone to supervise them?</p>
<p>Mr. Hu said, "Overseas student supervisors? No, no. The place is too big, you can't control them. Look, the United States is three thousand miles from east to west, and there are more than seven hundred universities, how can you supervise them? American universities are not managed by the government, students transfer from this school to that school, they do what they want, what can you do? Besides, setting up overseas student supervisors also has the suspicion of interfering with thought. If you supervise them for not studying hard, foreigners will suspect something else, it's really inappropriate."</p>
<p>Mr. Hu thought for a while and said, "Thirty years ago, I wrote an article called 'A Non-Overseas Study Talk.' This article was not included in 'Wen Cun' later. The main idea was that the country should invest more in running universities, and they should be run well, to a level that can satisfy domestic students—then there would be no need for overseas study. Between 1936 and 1937, the universities in China were at their most developed, comparable to foreign universities, at least more than ten of them. Although they suffered losses during the war, as long as the country is stable, I believe that in just two or three years—at most four years, they will definitely be able to recover. Not only the undergraduate programs, but also the graduate schools, it won't be a problem."</p>
<p>A chubby gentleman pushed open the door and entered, wearing small glasses, with a large pipe in his mouth, wearing slippers, and his hair disheveled like a small pyramid hastily molded from plaster—it was, of course, Mr. Fu Sinian. Mr. Hu smiled and invited him in to talk, but Mr. Fu didn't even finish hearing the phrase "They are reporters" before hurrying away!</p>
<p>I smiled and asked Mr. Hu if it was okay to talk about "a little bit" of politics, what his views were on the constitutional amendment draft. I knew that this question would definitely lead to awkwardness, but since it was time to leave anyway, I might as well try. Of course, I hadn't forgotten that Mr. Hu was also a diplomat. Mr. Hu smiled and came over and said, "This is difficult to talk about. Didn't I say four months ago that I was going to be an elementary school student when I came back this time? Students should have textbooks, and I always thought that the National Assembly Preparatory Committee would provide us with some reference materials—but there were none at all, I simply don't know anything."</p>
<p>At that moment, I thought about how to write the title of this interview: "Interview with National Assembly Delegate Hu Shih" didn't seem as good as the current title, so I gladly walked out of that warm room in the Institute of History and Philology. (14th)</p>

<h3 id="e185">Enthusiasm of Women Representatives at the National Assembly <a href="#e185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>— Our Special Correspondent</p>
<p>Women representatives at the National Assembly account for a fraction of the total number of 2,050. Although female compatriots make up half of the compatriots nationwide, it is true, as Secretary-General of the National Assembly Preparatory Committee, Hong Lanyou, said at a press conference, "Other countries have been constitutional for a long time, while we have only just begun, so we are naturally lagging behind." This inevitable lag is naturally manifested here. There is no need to explain how many female compatriots exerted themselves and ran around shouting to fight for female participation in the National Assembly before the list was released, and how many female compatriots were ridiculed for only knowing how to fight for rights. Now that the list has been released, from a woman's perspective, we can still feel somewhat at ease, because whether they are officially designated female representatives by the National Government, directly selected female representatives, or regional female representatives, they are all worthy of being representatives of female compatriots. Each of them earned their position with the talents they have demonstrated in the past or present.</p>
<p>We have a feeling that women are always more enthusiastic about things, especially when it comes to things that matter. For example, in terms of representative registration, they all rushed to complete the procedures as soon as possible, and they are particularly hopeful for the National Assembly. If you visit each female representative and ask for their opinions on national affairs and their hopes for the National Assembly, each of them will definitely tell you that they hope everyone will be open and honest, calmly resolve the issues, and allow the National Assembly to be held in an atmosphere of peace, unity, and solidarity.</p>
<p>Each female representative has her own career, whether in education or science, or in various departments that serve the country. This time, the representatives gathered in the capital from various places, sightseeing the capital and visiting old friends. At the same time, they also held several tea parties, introducing the living conditions of women in various regions, the regional economy, and their careers to everyone, so they were able to achieve the practical effect of exchanging opinions and learning from each other.</p>
<p>Among the representatives, some were originally in Nanjing, such as Chiang Soong Mei-ling, Liu Hengjing, Chen Yiyun, Zhuang Jing, Tang Guozhen, Xie Yifang, Shen Huilian, and Lu Yunzhang, who are all members of the Central Women's Movement Committee and chairpersons, directors, and supervisors of the Women's Guidance Committee. They are in constant contact with the broad masses of women and also serve the broad masses of women. They know the hardships of female compatriots, and they practically relieve the suffering of female compatriots, so they can truly represent the opinions of the female masses and are qualified to be representatives of women.</p>
<p>There are also female representatives from various places, such as Wu Jingbin, Deng Meizhu Na, Tao Jitian, Zhang Bangzhen, Feng Yunxian, and Luo Heng, who all have outstanding career achievements in Xinjiang, Xikang, Yunnan, and other places. They walk around the streets all day carrying a large leather bag in a hurry. If you want to know their extraordinary talents and outstanding demeanor, just pay attention to their various active postures at the upcoming National Assembly. (13th)</p>
