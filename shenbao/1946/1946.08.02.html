<p>（本報牯嶺一日電〕司徒大使今新病初愈，晨起即至園中散步，早中兩餐已能略進飲食，中午假眠片時後，精神轉佳，遂偕於下午五時美大使館顧問傳涇波往謁主席，談至六時主席、談至六時十五分始辭出。主席見大使病愈，甚表欣慰，對大使病後謁養關懷備至，曾再三敦囑「願以老友炎格，請在山休養數日一，大使以主席盛意股股，己允在牯嶺數日，然仍希望於下星期三以前返京。</p>
<p>〔中央社牯嶺一日電〕司徒雷登大使，一日下午五時晋謁蔣主席，晤談歷時幾一時十五分，六時一刻始辭出行　，其中有四十五分鐘，係就美海軍陸戰隊在平津公路被襲擊事件交換意見，蓋主席與大使均出自北平行轅及南京美國大使館接獲是項有關之報告資料甚多也。此外，並未涉及其他問題，惟主席對大使之新病初復，備致關切，曾語大使：「余非以中國元首地位，乃以多年老友資絡，請閣下在健康未完全復原前，勿離牯嶺」。大使以主席盛情難却，至少在牯尚有兩三日之休養。另據大使私人顧問涇波語記者，大使今日晋謁主席時，渠亦奉准隨行，主席與大使對美海軍陸戰隊在平津公路被襲事件，均認爲不幸，且極關懷，在與像未查明以前，不願遽作結論，如此事果係出於預設之伏撃，或係事前之有計劃行爲，不得不認爲嚴重。馬歇特便日前忽忽離牯，即爲與此項事件有關。記者曾詢以美陸戰隊死傷確實人數，傳氏謂尚難奉告，僅知有一中尉級軍官諳華語，曾於被襲擊時，挺身向前，請對方停止射擊，竟不幸中彈殞命。</p>
<p>〔本報北平一日電〕共產黨對香河事件之解釋，爲廿九日上午香河安平鎮附近，八路防地突遭來歷不明部隊襲擊，繼有美軍六十餘名參加，在戰鬥中互有傷亡，下午美軍增援，共軍自動撤退云云。</p>

<p>〔本報北平一日電〕蔣主席令平行轅李主任宗仁嚴査平津公路上美軍被襲事件之電令到達後，李氏即於一日下午召見孫連仲長官及軍調部委員鄭介民會商辦法。記者於孫鄰辭出後，往訪李主任晤談，除已由孫長官派其副參謀長馮松元率同冀第五區專員黃任材前往香河縣大小沙河衝突地點澈査外，並決定經過軍調部向共方交涉責任。此外，爲免今後再有不幸事件發生，即派足敷保護平津公路之軍隊沿路駐守。又孫連仲一日上午特派其參謀長宋肯堂前往美軍醫院，慰問受傷之美官兵。</p>
<p>〔本報北平一日電〕香河共軍襲擊美軍衝突中，有共軍軍醫一人受傷，被美軍俘虜，共產黨已承認爲當事人，軍調部派往調査之廿五小組，是否業已出發，軍調部政府，共產黨兩方俱言詞閃爍。據政府方面高級當局談：此不幸事件，牽涉外交問題，政府極爲重視，將向共產黨要求交出肇事人員，至撫卹死傷，政府亦擬辦理，惟美軍是否接受，尚不可知，軍調部委員鄭公民，昨派員撓果品慰問受傷美軍，李宗仁日內亦派員前往慰問。</p>
<p>〔本報北平一日電〕平津公路之香河縣境，向爲共軍游擊區，美軍被襲發生衝突前，該公路僅有商人來往，國軍或政府汽車從未利用，美軍之行，尚屬首次，乃即發生不幸事件。今後國軍將沿該公路進駐後，該公路或可通行無阻。</p>
<p>〔本報牯嶺一日電〕當局鑒於最近平津公路美軍襲擊事件之發生，認爲華北鐵路，公路治安實有立即予以加強之必要，務期確保交通之安全。又據華北方面傳來消息，平津，津浦鐵路綫，短期內有全部通車之可能。</p>
<p>〔中央社北平一日電〕平津公路上美兵被製擊事件，聞中共方面已承認爲共軍所爲，軍調部擬派特別小組前往調査，共方並無異議，惟美方主張俟陸戰隊之報告資料彙齊後，再使小組出發調告資料彙齊後，再使小組出發調查。</p>
<p>〔合衆社天津一日電〕美陸戰隊摩托巡邏隊，自星期一遭伏擊後，已大爲加強，該隊現帶有坦克車，火箭放射器等，據稱：今後該隊仍一如往昔，每三日巡邏一次，惟昨日之巡邏則事屬例外，二三日前曾有若干事故發生，緣駐紮天津東兵工廠之美陸戰隊，曾遭遇射擊數次，有一兵十受傷。據報，射手曾命市民作掩護，至外間謠傅美陸戰隊將自該兵工廠撤退一說不確。</p>

<p>〔中央社本市訊〕外傳中央組織部陳部長立夫日內將有廬山之行，記者聞訊，即往其寫邸晋謁、承陳氏接見，記者問：「聞部長即將赴廬，不識有何重要使命？」陳氏答稱：「本人確將赴廬一行，因廬山夏令營電邀前往演請也」。記者以七月三十日路透社南京電傳，周恩來發表渠與馬帥及司徒大使會晤後之第一次公開談話，其中有謂：「共黨之建議，均不越政協決議範圍，故政府若能接受，即不難建立和平，主要之阻碍，在於國民黨內欲以武力解決之份子，此可由陳立夫最近之談話證之」云云，因向部長對此有何意見，陳氏答稱：「本人爲最先並始終主張且會實行以政治方法解決國共問題之一人，在上次本人談話中，已略言之，此事經過，惟周氏與本人知之最詳，不應健忘若此。如周氏無推翻其以往和平團結主張之意圖，則何以對始終主張，且曾實行以政治方式解決之人如余者，加以如此之誣蔑與攻擊，故余對周氏此種言論，希望僅係其一贯「嫁禍於人」之宣傳技術，而不欲作更深之推論。和平民主之前提，繫於交通之恢復與軍隊之國家化，斯二者不能實現，則擁兵割據之情勢，始終存在，和平威脅與民主之障碍，未能解除，君若試以政府與中共對此二事所作之努力，作一比較，即可知政協決議誰在認眞實行，誰在肆意破壞。事實俱在，國內國外殆已共聞共見，亦不必斤以口舌爭矣」。記者復問周氏最近表示對部長之質問函件擬不予考慮置答，部長已有所知否，陳氏莊容言曰：「一個政黨負責人，對其誹謗他人之言論，而沒有一種負責態度，實爲至可惋惜之事，然余亦深諒周氏年來對其自己之言論，固無從負責也」。記者以陳部長訪客甚多，尚待接見，即興辭而出，握別時，記者復作最後之一問，謂「然則部長對此將採取次一步驟否」？陳氏揮其摺扇笑引孟子之言以答曰：「有人於此其待我以横逆，則君子必自反焉……自反而忠矣，自反而有禮矣，其横逆猶是也，君子曰，此亦妄人也已矣，如此則與……奚擇哉，與……有何難焉」。</p>

<p>〔本報南京一日電〕馬帥定本星期六赴牯，以與天人共度週末，至二日是否再約晤周恩來，現尚不悉，唯以目前情形觀之，談話一題，似已由國共政治商談之階段，進至「安平事件」矣。</p>
<p>〔聯合社南京一日電〕馬歇爾特使自牯嶺返京後，今日初次會晤周恩來，作懇切之長談，各方粉紛猜測馬使現已再度努力，以期促成聯合政府，解決中國難局。多數觀察家以爲中國軍事局勢，已完全失去控制，唯有實現聯合政府，方能補救，中共對於聯合政府之若干點，如國府委員會議席及行政院各部長之分配，曾提出反對，但由共如果　續爭吵，可能一無所獲，故對新政府之組織、或將加以默認，除非有此種急遽之步驟，迅　採行，否則大局前途黯淡。</p>

<p>〔本市訊〕國防部次長秦德純氏，應遠東國際軍事法庭之邀，於審訊日戰犯土服原·松井時，間出庭作證，北已任務完畢，昨日上午十時二十分，由東京乘我空電第八大隊B-24式轟炸機返國，於下午四時四十分抵滬，　機降落大塲，前往機塲歡迎者有國防部職犯管理處處長鄒任之少將，我駐日代表團上海通訊處主任姚更生等。奏氏戒狀，精神飽滿，下機後，與歡迎人員一一寒喧後，記者即趨前叩詢赴日出席國際法庭作謗觀感。</p>
<p>遠東法庭審判情形</p>
<p>渠稱：東京國際軍事法庭之公害，一如紐倫塵法庭，乃人類最高智籌期求阻止戰爭再起之表現。此種審判，對於世界和平與安全，能製生遠大之影響。在審訊日重要戰犯時，盟國外交與政界人士熟悉戰犯罪愆者均間被邀出庭作證，全因曾目賭蘆橋事變及其他日人之暴行，故亦為證人之一。審判採多數同意意制，對於每一戰犯，一面防止其逃脫綱，一面仍許其提充份反證，以便作有利之辯護。</p>
<p>日本人民均甚純良</p>
<p>談及戰犯責任一點，秦氏稱：余此次赴日，曾在京都·奈良·大坂·神戶，名古屋·橫濱·各地旅行，深覺多數日本人民思想均甚純良，故余以為發動侵略責任不在日本人民，且亦不在被徽召入伍之士兵（個人在戰爭期間犯暴行者除外），而實在少數發動侵略責任之軍閥，便如日本侵華陰謀實為土肥原一手包辦，大亞細亞主義實松井一人所倡導，責任至為明顯。</p>

<p>——讀王外長在巴黎和會致辭感言——</p>
<p>舉世矚目之巴黎和會，業於日前如期召開，我代表專長外交部長王世杰氏於一鄉貝爾納斯及英代表團長首相艾德禮之後，發表演說，對戰後持久和平之重建與我國所抱之政策，有所闡述。全文以重諾言尙正義為基幹，尤注意於和平之締造所可能加於戰敗國之影響，而歸結於此次和平之締造應為普通人民之和平，而不僅政府代表之和平，一若以往之若干和平處置，誠能映示我中正和平立國之道，表現我民族崇尚仁愛信義之沒得。是項原則之被採納，實為世界持久和平的必要條件。謹申數言，用述所感。</p>
<p>王外長的演說，難以締造普通人民之和平，非僅政府代表之和平，殿諸萹後，然此乃重建持久和平的先決條件，我們特別要強調這一點。第二次世界大戰原有「人民的戰爭」（People's　war）之稱，是「人民的戰爭」之後，必應有「人民的和平」（People's　peace），方能</p>
<p>確保和平的持久。何謂「人民的和平」？這就是戰後和平的締造，不應衹重視政府代表的意旨，而應以人民的意向為依歸，不應達反人民的意向而斷然有所決定，必使人民的願望能夠得到滿足，總能有持久和平的建立。這一原則的被提出，寶本於慘痛的歷史經驗。第一次世界大戰所締造的和平，它之所以不能持久，就是並不以人民的意向為一歸，而僅僅是散打巨頭或四大巨頭的個人意志的表現。他們本身的意志，既不能得到他們本國人民的擁護，其所締造的和平，又未能把握戰敗過人民的意向，故合約上的墨瀋未乾，就被撕毀，而希特勒之流終於乘時　起，撫今追昔，我們寶應強調建立「人民的和平，」使這次所締造的和平眞能持久維　。</p>
<p>在他向和會代表的演說中，王外長又特別指出兩點∶㈠戰勝過必須恪遵彼等在戰爭期間所作之諾言，一級其所揭　之原則。例如言及調解領土要求之衡突問題，吾人必不可忘記大西洋寭章，亦不可限制其實施；（二）戰勝國不應向戰敗國提出某種條件，足使戰敗國向之反動分子得捲土重來，而民主力量轉失去任何新生或鞏固的機會。這兩點的提出，實基於此次所締造之和平應為「人民的和平」之前提，此不過為如何締造「人民的和平」的一種說明，締造「人民的和平」的方法。大西洋寭章的實現，為作戰期內一般人民的願望，如今干戈息止，自應促其實現，以慰人民之望。至於戰勝國不應向戰敗國提出致令戰敗國內之反動分子得以卷土重來，而使民主力量失去任何新生或鞏固機會之條件，此在中國，感覺自然尤其銳敏。中國受日本反動分子的侵略歷時最久，故中國尤其不願見戰勝國提出任何致令戰敗國內的反動份子得以捲土重來的條件。此次巴黎和會的召開，雖不以德日為對象，然戰後一般和平締造的原則，必須確立，故雖無德日參加，此項原則，亦為廣被採納。凡此，均為建立「人民的和平」的基本條件。</p>
<p>然而當我們想及此次巴黎和會召開的經過，及報紙上所透漏的關於對義·羅·匂·芬·保諸國的合約草案，卻不盡令我們對於和平的再造幹倒戚戚。所謂「人民的和平」，其距離的路程，猶為遼達。誠王外長所云：「…余信各草案應由大會作較為充分之討論，因所設計之論題，對歐洲未來之安定大有影響。任何人試閱此等合約草案，均不能否認許多所獲致之協議，或係根據互相之妥協，如吾人能　獲改進方法，此並非為任何有關方面之狹隘利益，而實為廣大普遍之利益。一可知此次何雨草案之訂立，與「政府代表之和平」近，而與「普通人民之和平」似尚有當的距離。我們於此，又看見澳代表伊瓦特在和會的演說，主張列強不得寄語復仇精神，將意志強迫他人接受，會謂∶「我人之目標乃「公正」一詞，全球各國男婦老幼均盼貨的一堆彼等及其子孫符合公平原則之和平。我人苟以不公允與過分羞辱之重負，加於彼等之身，則有達民主精神，而法西斯又可能捲土重來。」其所言，與我王外長的演說，異曲同工，相互輝映，其中心要亦在建立「人民的和平」使和平得以持久。</p>
<p>這次巴黎和會的目的，雖在締造歐洲局部的和平，然其於將來世界的整個持久，和平關係實至重大。我們希望這次集合於巴黎和會的代表，能夠鑒於過去締造和平的失敗，知所警惕，為世界為人類能夠締造一種足以持久的和平—「人民的和平」。比如此，世界總能免於戰爭的浩劫。</p>

<p>— 本報駐英特約記者雪岩</p>
<p>英美調查團</p>
<p>便是想解決巴勒斯坦糾紛的一種努力。英美調查團，視察歐洲猶人及巴勒斯坦實情了，並聽取猶人和阿拉伯人代表的意見後，認為現在歐洲的猶人，大部分需要為其謀出路，而巴勒斯坦，現在是一個武裝的軍營，亦廳急謀解決的辦法，調查團因提出建議十點，綜結起來：（一）解決歐洲流離失所的猶太人，非巴勒斯坦一地所能容納，希望世界其他有餘地的國家，也開放收容。但為急救起見，先於今年內移十萬人至巴勒斯坦。（二）　於目前巴勒斯坦的危機四伏，治權仍由英國繼續負但，將來或交聯合國的託管理事會（三）治理巴勒斯坦，應以二個民族平等共存為原則，不以建立單純的民族國家為理想。（四）提高阿拉伯人的教育與生活程度，應由治理當局，積極負責。費用可自猶人的稅收中撥移。（五）土地購買權的限制取消，而代以保障貧農的法律。這</p>
<p>報告書發表</p>
<p>後，英美反響，頗有不同。美國僅贊許其今年先移十萬猶人至巴勒斯坦一點，而英國則以「建議書整個的」為理由，堅持須全部實行，亦即延宕先移十萬人一點。現在美國政府，正與美當局商談中，希望美國能共同負責，同事並邀英美專家，共同商討實行的細則，在商有結果前，暫不實行。英國之統治巴勒斯坦，原是受國聯的委託，美國本非會員國二者可謂風馬牛不相關。但英國處處牽致美國在內，當然是願到實際情形，美國是猶太人最多的國家，也是濟巴基斯坦猶人的泉源，所以得意美國合作，解決問題可獲方便不少。目前的建議，不但英美觀點背馳，且與英國的現行政策相反，能有助於英美合作者甚少。英國現在應付的方法，是在擱置延宕所謂專家討論，有時可以討論得很玄妙。莫說各種久遠的百年大計，非幾個專家一時所能商定。即說定今年移人的十萬猶人，如果要把衣食住行，都光為其安排好，恐亦非一年所能實行。所謂商談，恐怕是和專業開玩笑罷。貝文在工業年會中提及巴勒斯坦問題時說：「巴勒斯坦現有非法武裝勢力存在，如果在移十萬人去，英國便須增調一師兵之鎮壓，英國現在不准備這樣做。」我們相信這是</p>
<p>英國政策</p>
<p>很誠實的說明。英國對巴勒斯坦的問題，將來究竟打算怎麼樣解決，現在是否有具體的計畫，我們不得而知。但有一點似可確定，即英國無意讓猶人在巴勒斯坦建立一個單純猶太人國家。現在中東一帶廣大的地域內，幾乎完全是阿拉伯人的世界，同時又大多為英國的附屬式殖民地。進來因民族意識的發展，和各阿拉伯族國家相互間團結的增強，已使英人有窮於應付之概，現在如為了解決數十萬　泊的猶人問題，而換得數千萬阿拉伯人的敵意，這是英國所不幹的。貝文曾說：巴勒斯坦問題要在中東一般和平安全問題下謀解決；換句話說，既要在阿拉伯人諒解下謀解決，大概是句實話。要瞭解英國對巴勒斯坦的增測，應該從這角度去觀察。</p>
<p>英國最初主張派遣英美聯合調查團的目的何在，現在不很明白；但調查團的建議顯然遭反英政府最初的意願，所以英政府採取延宕敷衍態度。至於搜索猶人辯團處，逮捕大批猶人，顯然是與調查團建議不相干的獨立行動。直接目的，雖在企圖消滅恐怖行動的根源，　　反抗英當局的組織，但於打擊猶人的組織後，以後即施壓制政策，抑或待稍寧靜後，再漸次實行調查團的建議呢？目前還不能預測，我們還該待事實的演變來證實。（完）</p>

<h3 id="c64">昔為扒兒手　今任總隊長　游民習藝所印象記 <a href="#c64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>要是你平時常有機會在馬路上走走的話，那你一定常常可以看見，有許多乞丐，扒手，小偸等，在警察的抑解下，用囚犯車把他們載走，你當時是不是也曾想過，把他們載向那兒？戰去以後又怎樣？</p>
<p>要是你對本市累積的垃圾特別惡感的，那你一定曾經讀到過最近本版的一則小新聞—衛生局利用漕河涇游民習藝所三百餘人，淸除宿積垃圾。常時你也許輕輕的忽略過去了，留下的印象，只是門口的垃圾堆可以逐日清除，但是你是否也曾想一想，這些替你掃除垃圾的是誰？所謂「游民習藝所」又是怎麼回事？</p>
<p>最近，記者隨着衛生局長張維，到漕河涇去參觀上海市救濟難民難童收容所，這就是那些被扒的乞丐，扒手，小偷等的收留地，也就是游民習藝所的從身，因為在戰前，就置以這個名字聞名的。</p>
<p>警察局在抓到了這些游民以後，便立即送到漕河涇的收容所，剛送到的時候，滿身都是癩疥瘡，頭髮上的虱子是結成球的。第一步工作，就是要把他們洗乾凈，然後再為他們醫治，其中最普通的疾病是沙限，十尙中間患者差不多佔九個半。經過一番整理以後，就依照他們的年齡，編入各組。十四以下的是幼童營，十四到十六歲是兒童營，十六到十九歲的是少年營，十九到三十歲的是青年營，三十歲以上的是老年營，各營的日常課程表不同，但是每個人都有讀書的權利，也必頭有作工的義務。</p>
<p>分配工作·各有所長</p>
<p>除了以年齡編入各營以外，還依照其特長分配工作，現在已經成立的有縫紉班，木作班，泥水班，編鞋班，製鞋班等，各人的衣服，友所中的設備如桌椅等都由他們自已製作，燒飯，洗衣，打掃等等都有人專司其職，分工的完善，合作的局密，是任何團體比不上的。她們的口號是「自治互助」，從日常生活中培義起「羣」的觀念。平日管理的原則是教養並重，工讀兼施，教之以藝，感之以德，成人以生產教育為重，儘量發掘人才。</p>
<p>艱民難童收容所佔地九十餘畝，其中百分之三子為房屋，餘下的儘是荒地，經過了洗民等辛勤開墾，現在已經道路平坦，濃圃井然了。收容所到現在，已經有一段不短的歷史，聽說在敵偽佔據時，曾架起了機關槍來管理，這和目前的悄勢，相差實在太遠了，現在所內的共約三千多人，最小的三歲，最大的七十一歲，其中大多數都是淪落街道的乞丐，經過了僅幾個月的訓練，已經誰都捨不得離開這塊屬於他們自己的園地了。</p>
<p>自我教育，成績優良</p>
<p>收容所自敵偽手中接收下來，經過整頓後，開辦到現在，總共不過八個月，但是這八個月來的成績是警人的！從前被稱煩「爺叔」的大扒手，現在都當了總隊長，要負責訓練別人了，而現在住在裏面的人，雖都再不肯吐露昔日的所作所為，除非你逼緊了間他，「你是那個分局送來的」？「你從前是做什麼的」？於是他才只得張紅了臉，羞人答答地從齒縫中迸出「討論記」二個安來！</p>
<p>當張局長·記者等一行人到所參觀時，他們已輕一排排整齊地集合在大廣塲上，在大總隊長的指揮下，開始檢閱，秩序的良好，步伐的整齊，是任何學校的學生所及不上的！無怪他們的所長說：「國外人士來所參觀時，我們從來沒有丟過中國人的險」！這決不是一句憑室誇口的話，而是事實放在眼前——他們起居都有定時，在走廊中貼滿了壁報，自已油印敎科會，實行自我敎育，他們有肩己的銀行·法院·消費合作社，而且據張局長告訴記者，他親自參觀過他們吃飯，簡直比和尚還要快，還要守秩序。</p>
<p>經過訓練後的壯年游民，各界都搶先雇用，其中五百名已被工務局派往浦江挖泥，三百名於最近曾帮助衛生局清除垃圾，更有五百名將由警察局派至東北當警士。他們昔日都是流浪街頭的渣滓，今日都成了社會的生產者了。</p>
<p>經費困難，希望援助</p>
<p>要特別介紹的，是該所所長局祖望先生，他還是一個廿九歲的青年，但是他甘願把寳貴的年月，青春的活力，交付在這個偉　大的工作上，他犧牲了靑年人應有的享受，住在收容所裏，和這羣游民生活在一起，經常的接觸，使他染上了一頭的癩癱，滿身的疥瘡，但是他沒有一句怨言，他說：他幹這個工作，原不想要任何酬報，但是行政的困難，確實叫他灰心的。現在當局撥給的經費運單供膳食也不夠，其他的一切設備，如醫藥·衣服·文具·肥皂等等，都是由所長親自向各界叩頭求拜得來的，而且都在嚴重的鬧恐慌中，周先生拉着一個孩子的衣服向記者說：「道是獨一無二的，脫下了身上的一套，就沒有第二套了」，而這套僅有的衣服還是本市理髮業同業公會捐贈的，因為有一次，有許多理髮匠去參觀他們的所中情形，結果極為感動，就自動的捐贈了每人一套衣服，此外如藥品等，都是念需的，但都在恐慌中。</p>
<p>我們明瞭市府當局經濟的困難，但是像這樣一個有意義的團體，是無論如何要沒法予以支持的，我相信，每一個人，只要有機會到一次漕河涇，看看昔日橫行街道，無惡不作的流民，今日怎樣安分地讀書，識字，工作，誰都會深深地感動的。現在聽說中央攝影塲已決定於木月中為他們攝成電影，同時該所也將大規模的招待記者，我出乎眞誠的希望記者們不要錯過了這個機會，我更希望大人先生們，和太太小姐們，也能勞一次尊駕，然後，我相信你們都會有力地伸出你們的援手來的！（斯在）</p>

<p>〔本報南京訊〕國立西北師範學院院長袁敦禮，已於三十一日晨由京飛平，行前與本報記者談考察美國體育近況，略誌於下：袁氏在美國除考察敎育外，於體育部份，計參觀考察美國大字體育系二十九，健康敎育學系五，軍校體育二，體育專校三，縣市健康敎育八，傷兵醫院體育設施三，關認兒童發育之研究機關九，與美衛生及體育者接談者有四百人，美國體育之理論無所變更。</p>
<p>戰時體育</p>
<p>惟於軍隊之體育，為適應作戰需要，海陸空軍均增加體育訓練，每日有四五小時之體格鍛練，以四個月為期，即可完成其任務和目的。但戰事結束後，是項訓練即停止，恢復常態，又旗行傷兵體育訓練，各傷兵醫院均設有體育指導員，利用體育訓練及各種娛樂活動，使傷兵身心愉快，迅速恢復健康，據調查統計，傷兵因此可縮短信院時間三分之一，至美國娛新人新事活動，包括體育運動，與藝術，勞作，音樂等公敦人員，業餘多走入娛樂塲，及公家設置之娛樂館，為有益身心之娛樂。而舞蹈方面，恢復美國土風舞，Old　Ametica　Dances及SguaneDances舞時着古裝，雅態翩翩，近代舞亦甚發達。</p>
<p>體育敎育</p>
<p>袁氏受部託代聘美籍體育敎師，經與美體育名流麥克樂商洽結果，聘男危策五人，女敎現二人，（注重技術），於四月初由使館轉電敎部，請匯路費。至回國時，未接復電，未便肯定，回國後如知六月中鋰款已匯出，然為時已過遲，而我國現時生活情形比美國高出三倍，各校復員，因交通未能盡量運輸，暫時尙難一律就緒，聘請美國體育敎師，本期恐須緩來。</p>
<p>名流講學</p>
<p>袁氏接洽美國體育界名流麥克樂，與威廉二氏，來華講學。麥氏現主持Iowa省體育，彼因退休獎金關係，不能自主來華，須我國代向美校請假，如可以來華，於一九四七年夏來華講學半年，但須集我國高級體育從業人員，預作準備，以便聽講與研究，研究項目，約為體育課程，人體機動學，體育理論，體育測騐，體育研究訪方法等。威氏在哥倫經亞大學體育系主敎，現已退休，彼如來華，可留一二年。彼深知中國抗戰艱苦，經濟困難，希望從美國設法費用，來華擔任工作，惟須先和中國全國體育狀況之調查，然後再訂全國體育計畫，並召集高級體育人員二三十人，從事講習及研究工作。又美體育界熱心贊助我國，已由Nasp領導發起，在美開始募集體育圖書惠贈我國。</p>

<p>— 本報駐平記者　宋紹柏</p>
<p>經過長久淪陷而失掉光彩的文化故都，顯然因胡適光生的重臨，增添了不少的生氣。胡氏方到北平，馬上抽出了一個多小時的時間，和北平的記者們暢談了一場。</p>
<p>下午五點多鐘，胡博士走進屋來：「對不起，對不起！」一邊說，一邊連　抱拳。滿臉笑容，似乎比九年前靦腆了。灰綢長衫，綢褲，黑鞋，連連搖著摺扇，學者氣度上還放溢着外交官的風采，這是以前沒有的。傳斯年穿著短衣褲做在對面，給現場談話增加了不少笑料，時時在想幫腔，給胡博士解了不少的圍。最後還是他發動了胡大少爺（祖望），把胡氏搶救出去。</p>
<p>胡氏給記者們的印象很好，第一他不打官腔。說起他離開故都的經過，有些感慨系之：「七七後二日，我離開了北平去牯嶺開會。七月廿八日北平淪陷，是日我下山，到南京。九月廿日，自香港乘機飛美。此次歸來，恰整整九年，北平的學校損失小，景物依然，我很愉快，尤其是今天幾乎看見了所有的老朋友。但是老友錢玄同，馬裕藻，孟森（心史），則已故去。」</p>
<p>（一）因李聞血案申論自由</p>
<p>關於北大的事，胡氏一總推在傳斯年身上，感謝傳的偏旁。對於國事也是說，去國九年，知者太少，作一年小學生，幷找一份九年的報紙讀過才好說話。話題便轉到李聞血案。「我和李公樸不熟悉，和聞一多則是十多年的老朋友。」他稱贊聞氏的學術成就，惋惜聞氏的死，與奮之下，說起自由問題。他說：「人應由容忍精神，即Tolerance，自己要有自由，但须同時尊重別人的自由，暨如我胡適是一個無　論者，但是我應當為信奉上帝的人爭信仰的自由。信仰，發表，言論等自由，是不可少的。西歐盎格羅薩克遜的自由精神，是可貴的。過去北大的精神是如此，暨如辜鴻銘帶辫子教書，劉光漢籌保安會保皇黨也照樣講學，互不排斥，這是蔡孑民光生的偉大譴風，將來的北大決仍繼續保持此種精神。」胡氏請記者提倡道種精神。</p>
<p>（一）大體上說中國是進步了。</p>
<p>胡氏提醒人們，不必因個別小事而懷疑前途，更不要悲觀。他說：「大體上說，中國是進步了。」幷舉例：「我在南京，王世杰，朱家驊二先生，都會為我舉行茶會，在這茶會上，我看見了周恩來，董必武等共產黨人參加，聯合國第一次大會，董必武也代表了中國政府出息，在京滬有共產黨的情報，風行市上，這都是進步的象徵，希望他發展下去。」因此問題，胡氏記起毛澤東似乎還是北大的旁聽生，但對而的傳斯年接口說：「不對，不對，我們不要掠美！范文瀾卻是北大的較瘦。」</p>
<p>因為論自由，某幾折問起暨如上海的問匯報被停刊了一星期，……胡氏說，按照美國的慣例，如果自己覺得是壓迫，可以起訴。隨著有人問國共談判前途如何，胡氏尚未說話，傳斯年先生又幫腔了。某記者便說：「我們是問胡先生，請傳先生勿再此時開口。」胡氏則連連說，傳先生是我的代理人，但還是用話避開：「我們做歷史考據工作，是要小題大做，因一小問題而廣及其他，這問題太大，不好檢討。」</p>
<p>（一）白話文的二大阻碍</p>
<p>有人請胡氏檢討一下新文學運動。他說：「這問題太大，不好說，但是我覺得在新文學運動中，白話文面前還橫着二大阻力，第一，政府太不解放，到現在公文函電，還用文言，第二是責新聞界，現在的報紙上，十分之六七還是用文言。」胡氏認為這些都改用白話，皆無不可，並以大公報濮陽的一白話新聞電為例，而大加稱讚。力言要書量用白話創造個人的文格，表現個人的意見。廣播用語，更為重要。他說：「前兩天在大公報上看見一篇胡先驌先生的文章，那裡面居然也用了五六十句白話，這誠是我胡適的一大快事！」胡先驌是反對白話最力的一位。</p>
<p>因為論新聞白話，猶人請胡氏批評共產黨的報紙，胡氏說：「還沒進過解放區，不便作批評。」隨著又有人問：「假使有機會你去不去？」「那一定去的！」這時傳斯先生又搭話了：「去的時候，一定要請X小姐做變導　因為X小姐去過張家口。所謂X小姐，便是請傳先生不要開口的人。而小姐也就說：「傅先生是去過延安的，響導應當是傳先生！」一塲小糾紛，被另一個「美國人對中國的看法究竟怎樣？」的問題掩過去。</p>
<p>（一）美對華政策無變化</p>
<p>「美國的對華正常，百餘年始終如一，表而雖也表現出個別的不同論調，而基本政策的「門戶開放」毫無變更。」胡氏又解釋「門戶開放」說：「這不是利益均等，而是不許任何一過獨霸中國，因為那樣會引起戰爭的。美國的大多數人，希望中國成功一個摩登的民主，和平，統一，繁榮的國家，那時才能機會均等，如同以馬歇爾樣的特等人材來調解問題，便是這政策的反映。</p>
<p>（一）會作詩勸周作人</p>
<p>胡氏表示：他不對周作人作批評，因為「在今天對曾為多少年的老朋友說什麼話都是痛心的」！尤當此正宣判的時候。胡氏說抗戰之初，他曾作詩寄給周，勸他到後方去，周也曾以詩回答，表示現在走不掉，但望相信他不會做出對不起朋友們的事，兩詩周作人都會發表在報上。</p>
<p>（一）來日方長少考問吧</p>
<p>某女記者請問胡氏批評中國女子大學教育的當否，胡氏聲明道問題應交專家去討論，但謂中國婦女的解放，是歷史上偉大的一頁，以前最不美麗的中國女人，今日已成為世界美麗婦女的一種，看見在坐有幾位女記者，說美國的女記者亦不及男記者多，中小學教育員却女多於男，在中國，男女還不能機會均等。</p>
<p>問題太多了，胡氏感到答不勝答，所以最後說：「我一年二年是不離開北平的，來日方長，少考問我一些吧」。他說：「水經注，是我的玩意，與抗戰，民主，和平，都無關，在美國　的是中國的思想史，英文講義年後可以印出，醫生不許大規模講演，同時紋理難於維持秩序，也是不講為妙，免出亂子」。這時胡大少爺來促駕。某女記者開玩笑：「您就是胡顯示的兒子」？因為她記起了胡博士的「我的兒子」新詩來。（卅五·七·廿九·）</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕自六廰公債風潮以後，銀錢業收縮頭寸，工廠行號平日之恃拆款貼票以資週轉者，頗受打擊，其影響至今未已，棉布業頭其一也，該業自敵偽強迫徽　紗布以來，存貨蕩然，祇有門店之繁營綢緞呢絨及交綫新生產布疋者，尚能苦撐場面，然以徵購損失，大傷元氮，其景况大不如前，就大名鼎眉之三大祥而言，關其存貨與人手之數量，亦逈非普比，至於批發號子，停閉者甚多，其未除去招牌者，或意在保留此棉布號家之資格，以待時機或尚希冀偽徵購紗布之剩餘額，政府能秉公發還，其中向為本市及客　樂道之日新三家，日新增早已易主，改營什貨（包括棉綫品）日新盛玻門虛掩，優台生虞，幾同一座枯廟，日新昌早已停閉矣。據棉布業公會方面透露消息：</p>
<p>生死問題　刦餘紗布之能否發還，關係該業生死問題，仍擬有再接再厲，向關係方面謀有力之控訴。在該業沒落期中，獨有鄭家本橋及南陽橋一帶，年來刦有規模較小之新興布號，為數不少，一個月以前之數個月間，表面上曾鬧熱一時，自公大棉布號擱淺後，風聲鶴唳，市面多存戒心，據薄利多銷性質，熱本太重，拆息太高，實亦剝不出肉子來，自六底金融發生變動，銀錢業收縮頭寸。</p>
<p>缺乏頭寸　棉布業中之首當其衝者，多屬此種字號，蓋其所以薄利多銷者，半由吃進款子，不得不求其多週轉幾次也。具其由有一部份，借短款以定外洋其貨。迄今未到期，款被僅索。</p>
<p>定貨逼倒　危機遂以釀威，公大號即其一例，最近雙有某祥擱淺，其牽連不若公大之巨，然業中業外，頗為寒心，據該業機威者方面談話，現在拆息太高，同業生意之所獲，往往不夠聽息子。</p>
<p>紡建分銷　用紡建在外埠啟遍設分銷處，業中人客帮去路更狹，如此內外交撻，實非了局，近有某大染織廠以二十數萬萬元週轉不靈，為廣帮逼得擱淺，因此客幫對於染織廠，亦具戒心，據消息靈通方面稱，該廠可望迅即復業，染織廠究係有實力之廠家，與空頭號家不同，但將擬具辦法，節省開支云，據金融業中人消息，現在放款，最歡迎的是紗廠，染織廠及棉布業之苦樂，恰與紗廠業成反比例云。</p>

<h3 id="c118">芝加哥湖光水色 <a href="#c118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>— 本報二十日芝加哥航訊　駐美特派員毛樹清</p>
<p>芝加哥，美國的心臟，農產品和工業品的集散地。這座三百五十萬人口的大都市，聳立在密歇根湖畔，。已是仲夏的季節了，芝加哥還是那麼冷意森森。我從紐約出發的那天，朋友們都說「用不著帶大衣了」，但是，一到芝加哥，凍得淸水鼻涕滴褡流·電車裏碰着一位美國的老頭子，老用兩眼釘住我，隔了半響說：「中國的年靑朋友，你沒有大衣穿嗎？我這件雖然破了，但可以剝下送給你！」我弄得非常　尬，很費了些勁，把意思說明：我是有大衣的，不過放置在紐約了罷！「我還年青，這點冷算得什麼」？</p>
<p>鋼鐵業的重心</p>
<p>我是在一個大熱天的下午離開紐約的，到第二天淸早，才到達芝加哥的「賴薩爾」車站，火車整整走了十六個小時，橫跨過美國東西海岸的三分之一，這一帶，是美國人口最稠密的區域，也是最富饒的區域，美國人通常稱俄亥俄，伊利諾安，印第安那這幾州，叫作「中西部」，實際，攤開一幅美國地圖，這幾州，都應該稱作東部，或中東部。其所以有一個「西」字，那是在十九世紀西移運動的時候叫出來的，正如同我們把陝西稱作『西北」一樣。蘭州才是中國大陸的中心，陝西不但不是西北，而且還是東部呢！</p>
<p>許多相似的情形，在中美兩國的地理上，司以發現，芝加哥，無疑像中國的武漢，武漢是中國水陸交通的中心，芝加哥也是，武漢是中國煤鐵工業的中心，芝加哥也是。在芝加哥，睜開　眼，看不見紐約的高樓大厦，看不見紐約的金碧輝煌，也看不見華盛頓的淸凈雅緻。雖然芝加哥也有廣寬的馬路，也有馬路兩旁的綠楊垂柳，但我，不，任何遊客對芝加哥的影象，都見黑漆漆的，不但芝加哥房屋的顏色是黑漆漆的，馬路中心高聳着的高架火車，盡是黑漆漆的鋼骨架成的。有一天，我從熱鬧市區，坐電車到六十三街訪一位朋友，剛下電車，忽然一陣煤烟奔進鼻子。芝加哥的烟突之多，是紐約和華盛頓所絕對看不到的，芝加哥全市的鐵路鋼軌里程，比好歲州的全部鐵道還要多。</p>
<p>當然，鋼鐵業的重心，要首推匹茨堡，（賓夕法尼亞省），南北戰爭時代，林肯總統的兩個最大憑藉，一個是匹茨堡，一個便是芝加哥。這次我從紐約西行，買的是「潘司滿格」的車票，火畫沿赫特遜河上行，到紐約州的省會阿爾拜南，然後沿歐耳湖西行，穿過賓夕法尼亞州的一角，進入俄亥俄州，再橫貫印第安那州，到達芝加哥，這一條綫，又叫做「水平鐵道」，當年建造的時候，是沿河沿湖造的，避出賓夕法尼亞和佛傑尼亞的東岸邱陵地，因此沒有路經匹茨堡·雖然繞了一點遠圈，但是因爲走得快，還是合乎經濟原則的。</p>
<p>潘司滿格列車</p>
<p>「潘司滿格」列車，對美國人，算是最受歡迎的一種，不但走得快，震動少，而且坐椅也比較舒適，不願意化重價買「臥車」票的旅客，員一張「潘司滿格」的坐車票，晚上把坐椅轉下來，可以發生相當近於臥車的效用，因之，每次「潘司滿格」的列車開出，多半要在一星期以前親自訂座，訂座的行列長得可怕，有時候，要站著等上一二個鐘頭，但是，許多人寗願挨等，不願搭別的車子。資本主義的社會，什麼都是民營的，民營企業，造成了服務精神的競爭。</p>
<p>在紐約的時候，許多中國來的朋友，都不惯紐約的氣候，到芝加哥以後，我覺得芝加哥的氣候更壞。芝加哥潮濕，天熱的時候，潮濕得令人全身發膩。又因爲近湖，氣候容易變，陰雨的時間很多，我早上八點鐘到芝加哥，下午一二點鐘的時候，熱得渾身發汗，朋友們邀約，去傑克遜公園划船，我們從傑克遜公園的小河，划到密歇根湖的口岸，忽然間，陰雲密佈，雷電交作，再加上傾盆大雨，船雖沒有翻，但幾個人都淋得像落湯之雞。就是那一天，晚上氣候變得奇冷，第二天，芝加哥的居民，都穿上了黑呢大衣。</p>
<p>住慣芝加哥的美國人或者外國八，却曉得出門帶一件雨衣，年老的人，很多掛一柄洋傘。一般說，芝加哥的美國人，比較樸實，沒有像紐約那樣爭奇鬥艷。如果說，紐約象徵一個世界消費的都市，芝加哥則象徵一個生產的都市，在紐約，泰姆士廣塲，來來往往的人山人海，雖然也匆匆忙忙，但這些匆匆忙忙的人，大半是在追求享樂，在尋求消費。芝加哥就不是這樣，芝加哥街上來來往往的人山人海，都彷彿與芝加哥市的一萬多個工廠有關係。在芝加哥街上，大大小小的工廠，都標有牌記，而且有「歡迎參觀」的說明。大的企業，像屠宰塲，報館，印刷廠，印刷機器製造廠，都設有專門招待參觀的專員，他們逐部遂門的在旁解釋，增加了參觀者的知識，又替自己的廠家，做了廣告。許多鄉下美國人，老太太，小孩子，一旦有機會到芝加哥，他們是決不放棄這些尋求都會知識的機會的。</p>
<p>外國人在芝加哥的，不像紐約那樣雜。日本人最多，但也不過六七千人，他們經營一點小商業，男男女女，常常可以在街上碰見。戰爭的時候，他們是沒有自由的。華僑三千多人，跟各地的華僑一樣，他們自成一區，他們創浩了全世界一致的「唐人街」。芝加哥的唐人街在第二十二條街附近，距離最繁華的市區，不及一英里。在唐人街上，有聲立著的中國皇宮式建築：「安良工商會」，比紐約唐人街，富麗堂峯得多。據說，這座建築，是美國經濟衰落的時期造的，化價五十萬美元，如今估價，至少在二百萬以上。</p>
<p>華僑生活現狀</p>
<p>華僑像其他各地一樣，開餐館，開洗衣作，靠不中不西的「雜碎」和「炒麵」，吸引美國的大量食客。機器洗衣，容易使衣服損壞，美國人最欣賞華僑洗衣店的「手工洗衣」。這此赤手空拳　美金的華僑，都是芝加哥安良總會的基本幹部。他們動奮工作，但畢竟缺乏知識。陳長樂總領事和我談華僑們的生活，最興奮，也最感慨：「他們會賺錢，謙了錢就是賭博，賭博變成了他們最主要的業餘生活，成了他們一種幾乎無法撲減的風氣。」</p>
<p>我沒有時間去參觀華僑們賭博的實况，從幾位華僑知識靑年的口中，略略聽到過一些，華僑子弟受高等敎育的，實在太少了，很多男孩子，中學畢了業，就出任飯館的西崽之類的工作，因爲這些工作掙的錢多，比大學畢了業的更好。</p>
<p>當然，也有華僑靑年，是在大學念書的，芝加哥大學，就有好幾位。芝加哥大學在美國，與哈佛耶魯並稱，算是第一流嚴格的學校，中國學先好幾十人，多半是國內來的。芝加哥大學校長郝金思先生，是一個敎育哲學家，第二次大戰結束以後，他一貫的鼓吹「世界政府」，和大科學家愛茵斯坦的意見唱和，芝加哥大學的學生，不知從那兒聽設，都相信他們的校長，會參加一九四八年的總統競選。</p>
<p>大學形形色色</p>
<p>事實上，芝加哥大學不僅對戰爭有貢獻，而且，它的學術的培育，是有他深厚的基礎的。聯合國安全理事會的波蘭代表奧斯加，蘭祺，當今世界第一流的大經濟學家，在他沒有從政以前，老早就取得了美國的公民資格，在芝加哥大學講學。芝加哥大學的學生，對蘭祺之拋棄，粉筆生涯，仍懷念不置。美國學者對原子炸彈的研究，芝加哥大學的貢獻最大。至今，芝加哥大學後面的健身房，還是鐵門緊閉，「禁止人內」，因爲這座健身房，與原子彈的構造有關，還聽說美國軍部，仍然和芝加哥大學的幾名物理學敎授，保持極密切的聯繫。中國官費留美學生楊振寗君，幫助敎授作原子理論的研究工作，被賞識爲極有希望的天才。</p>
<p>芝加哥大學對中國問題的研究和討論不多，據說有位敎授叫作麥克南的，專攻遠東問題，某次演講中國的前途，他說：中國取消領事裁判權以後，將强烈趨向於狹隘的國家主義。他又說香港問題，必將成爲中國人民最密切注視的焦點。說了很多，都是「牛頭不對馬嘴」的話，不知他從書本上研究得來的『無邊空倫』。</p>
<p>最合我不可思議的一件事，是芝加哥大學的學生，不問是什麼國籍的·都一致痛惡『芝加哥講壇報』，這情形，是在我到達芝加哥以前，所絕對想像不到的。他們說。講壇報的言論是開倒車，講壇報是一個莫明其妙的落伍的報紙。</p>
<p>美的密歇根湖</p>
<p>原先，我打算一到芝加哥，就參觀『講壇報』的，因爲，他無論如何，是美國新聞事業歷史上，銷數保持最多的一家。芝加哥人說，現在情形都變了，「不信嗎？你瞧瞧每日新聞和太陽報，眞不知比他高明多少倍」？</p>
<p>另外一個變了的現象，是紐約的報紙，已經替代了歷史上的芝加哥的新聞黃金時代，現在，芝加哥的美國人，都訂得有紐約時報，紐約每日新聞，或者紐約下午報。有一次，在環湖火車裏，我看見一位美國老年人，在看紐約時報，我間他是不是常住在芝加哥的？他說：『是的』，他說；「芝加哥人看芝加哥的報紙，等於喝一杯涼水。看紐約報紙，等於喝一杯咖啡或濃茶」。他問我是否同意他的話，我輕輕點頭。</p>
<p>環湖火車停在籣道夫街口，火車鐵軌和湖岸之間，還有寬暢的馬路，芳草如茵，綠蔭森森，照映著密歇根湖的湖光水色。這一條湖濱的馬路，是芝加哥的精華所在，也是這黑漆漆的工業之城的唯一點綴。我在蘭道夫街車站下車，穿過密歇根愛文義路，回到我住的全世界最大的旅館——史蒂芬飯店。疲勞了一天，斜靠在臨湖的窗檻，望着碧波盪漾的湖光一抹，眞有說不盡的舒暢和輕鬆。</p>

<p>— 本報十六日航訊　駐美特派員毛樹清</p>
<p>我始終沒有參觀原子彈製造綠，我和比利時柏希法官商量了好幾次，要不要口頭『要求』一下，我想來想去，總覺得說不出口，縱然他們允許了，也不過給我們看幾幢房子而已，我們都不是專一家，『何必去自找難題目呢？』</p>
<p>有一個製鉛工廠，也在方答郝水閘附近，或許，也是用電方便的關係。去方答那水閘途中，我們經過一個削璧，萬仭山崖，有碧綠的細流，流經深處，像鄂西的天橋一般，那兒遠遠可以望見一座小水閘，戈爾塢水閘，也是二十六座之一，但沒有發電廠等等。</p>
<p>方答那大水閘，開工於一九四二年一月一日，緊接著珍珠港事變以後，羅斯福總統的一大傑作，完工於去年一月二十日工程剛好三年，如今除水閘發電室以外，還在加修幾座水池，及參觀室等等。閘上一位工程師，約翰孟軒，帶領著到各處參觀，他說，方答那水閘完工以前，有五千工人，在這兒工作，如今，只剩下了四百人。他指引著閘旁架在兩山之間的織索吊橋，施工的時候。用來裝運材料通蒸汽車用的，他說：方答那水閘築成以後，閘後成了人工的大湖，水源從山坡流到湖中，有三十五英里的靜水，這三十五英里的天然動力，都集中到發電機上了。</p>
<p>人工湖的深度有四百英尺，約翰孟軒說，將來什麼都佈置好了，可以弄游艇，讓人垂釣。他說：參觀室約九個月可以造成。我看見隆隆的重卡車，還在裝運石料，閘上還是一派工作的氣象。</p>
<p>約翰孟軒帶我們到後面新佈置的市集，那是一個叢山間的新村，名字呌做威爾集。和水閘隔一座山，新村在山的背面，現在因爲公路開關了，來往都非常方便。新村中有學校，商店，餐室，和許多「活動房子」，從前原是職員工人們住的，現在工程人員走了，被北加羅里納州政府利用租給於客們住，許多參觀TVA的美國人，帶著太太，這兒住一個星期，租金高到每星期四十元，甚至八十四元。</p>
<p>現有的閘上職員，都住在新村中，山窪間，夏天比城市還好，他們在這世外桃源中工作，也在享有著這世外桃源的良辰美景。</p>
<p>瑙雷斯水閘</p>
<p>同樣的情形，在瑙雷斯水閘，也是一樣。瑙雷斯在諾城北邊二十五英里，瑙雷斯的新村，比方答那更美，許多人從別處特地移到瑙雷斯來住，他們在這兒釣魚，游泳，划船，享受他們世外桃源的生活。</p>
<p>瑙雷斯水閘，是一九三三年TVA成立以後，最早開工的一個，始於一九三三年十月一日，成於一九三六年七月二十八日，全部費用約三千萬元，閘身高二百六十五英尺，長一千八百六十英尺，比方答那小得多。其所以用瑙雷斯之名，乃是紀念TVA之父參議員瑙雷斯而起的。（關於參議員瑙雷斯，我將另文介紹）</p>
<p>瑙雷斯水閘的外觀，也和方答那水閘不同，方答那維踞在兩山之間，正面築閘，電力廠即在閘的正中，瑙雷斯水閘築在兩個邱麓之間，電力廠在岸的一邊，閘上也可通汽車，有大幅美國國旗；飄揚閘上。</p>
<p>瑙雷斯水閘已經全部完工，水一閘的材料，也是鋼骨水泥，閘下一有活動鐵門，遇雨季水位高漲時，可以開啟閘門，讓過剩的水力，自由流出，建閘所用的石料，很多由就近取給，閘邊一座石山，被採去了半壁。</p>
<p>瑙雷斯電力廠的發電量也比較小，參觀　　　台，都已　全部建築完成，　後的人工湖，比方答那的更美，許多游　已經出動，男男女女的青年，在那兒游泳，瑪雷斯湖的後面，有　雷斯公園，園內多樹木以及簡單的小屋，很多人在這兒度夏，也有新婚夫婦在這兒度蜜月。陪我參觀的一位TVA職　戈爾碧先生告訴我：在這兒上游八英里，有一個更清　的地方，那兒有美麗的姑娘，經常在夏天游泳唱歌，有時候，躺在河邊作日光浴，有時候，在綠蔭森的月夜漫舞。</p>
<p>戈爾碧說：瑙雷斯現在不僅是田納西人的天堂，而且也是美國許多退伍軍人的天堂了，他們打完了仗，做了國家的職員，帶着他們幸福的家庭，卜居在這座世外桃源的小村子裏。</p>
<p>小村內有公園，有郵局，有各種方便的交通設備，也有用不完的電力，以及用電力發動出來的電燈，電扇和自來水。小村內現在有水利管理局，有市政府，也有公用大會堂。每家小家庭，有他們的花園，草坪和蔬菜蕃茄的園林之勝。</p>
<p>「但是」，戈爾碧不禁感慨了：『十三年以前，這是怎樣的一個世界？』他說：他從TVA開創的第二年起，便在這兒工作，中間有四年服軍役，遠征到海外。他曾經看到TVA從發芽到長葉，去年海外歸來，他才看到這一件偉大的功業，已經開花，而且結果了！（七月十六日，諾城）</p>

<p>「西藏政聞」關係方面談藏事近聞如次：自熱振呼岡克岡辭職，西藏即由達應攝政，達賴今年僅十四歲，尙不能主政，老班禪返藏途中，病逝青海，後轉世，新班禪藏　已在西康青海，各覺得一靈童，老班禪之隨員羅桑堅贊，亦在靑海循化，覓得一靈童，名官保慈丹，且已在靑海撘兒寺坐床。藏方擬將二靈童，接至西藏後，再舉行正式手續，判定何者應繼承班禪。中央所以遲遲未予撘兒寺靈童官保慈丹以正式封號者，即因其並未完成手續之故。拉薩方面，中央機關現有蒙藏委會辦事處，交通電台，及敎部國立小學，自沈宗康卅三年繼孔慶宗任辦事處長後，西藏與中央關係，極爲融洽。此次西藏國大代表，先各地代表到京，即爲西藏內向之表示。滇緬公路被切斷後，康藏人士，曾一度組織康藏馱運公司，利用犁牛馬匹，自印度翻越希馬拉雅山內輸物資，抗戰勝利後，此項艱難之運輸，業已結束。六中全會，雖有允許西藏高度自治之決議，內政部爲此亦曾召集有關部會討論，惟以國內擾攘未已，此事亦迄未有軕貝體決定。沈宗廉因患心臟病，頗不適於拉薩之高原氣候。此番隨西藏國大代表赴京，頗有倦勤之意，惟中央正予慰留中。喜饒嘉切前歲　藏被阻後，現在靑海原籍。</p>

<p>— 廿一日長沙航訊　黃潮如</p>
<p>經過一火四戰的長沙，它戰前的繁華，如今祇剩下頒垣斷壁，荒草蔓延的陳跡，十足表現它的冷落·蕭條·貧窮·老長沙話起昔日的長沙，大有「白頭宮女」的神氣。確實的，今日之長沙，面目全非·雖然通衢大街的店舖，表面上都復了業，實際上，店舖的後面一片荒凉，長草沒脛，置身其間，曾令你懷疑是在荒郊野塚，管有些商店，門面也裝璜得富麗堂皇，可是櫃房裏的存貨，無論如何是不會充實的。普遍的在外塲熱閙，內心痛苦中掙扎，這就和一位失去了靑春的女子，鉛粉胭脂儘管塗滿了臉，還是掩飾不了她憔悴的面容似的</p>
<p>魚米之鄉　竟也鬧成饑荒</p>
<p>長沙的冷落，蕭條，是戰時砲火所賜予，固是主因，可是戰時淪陷的都市，光復後都漸漸走向恢復繁榮的道路了，唯獨長沙何以還呈顯着一片凄凉情境呢？這其中還有另外一個主因在，那就是湘省今年閙着前所未有的災荒。全省陷在饑饉中，又如何能希冀這個農業性的城市恢復她的整榮呢？</p>
<p>提起了災荒，在科學落後的中國，什麽都被自然所征服，差不多年年終有一二處在鬧饑饉，所以並不算一件什麼希奇的事兒。但湖南是魚米之鄕，三湘七澤，國人素來視爲是華中的米倉，這裏不僅能够自給自足，且有餘糧供應鄰省，原有「湖廣熟天下足」之稱。抗戰期間，產米區的東南半壁，淪陷敵手，湖南曾担當過供應抗戰軍精民食的極大任務，有過「抗戰倉庫」的榮譽。可是，在戰爭結束的今日，這魚米之鄕竟也閙起饑荒來，這眞令人感到有點意外。</p>
<p>施賑大員　按鄉按保造冊</p>
<p>湖南災荒起因，除去夏久旱所受的影饗外，主因還是戰事，人民因爲寇禍，相率逃亡，流離他鄕，田園任它荒蕪了。尤其湘南山陵地帶，米產本不及湘東湖北暨濱湖一帶的豐富，再因田園的荒蕪，自然要閙糧荒了。三千萬人口的湖南，竟有了半數的一千五百萬絕糧的饑民，從今春起，到現在止，在湘南衡零等地，榭皮草根都吃完了，餓斃磯民，有地方每保以二十餘人計。善後救濟署爲了救濟湘災，曾以全力注視這方面，起初，各地災民聚集較衆之處，都設有施粥廠，後來，感覺粥廠難以普遍廣大的農村，且有粥少僧多之勢，於是改爲急賑，派出一批批施賑大員，携帶麥扮，按鄕按保造册放賑。這一善政，可期施賑的普遍，更免災民爲了吃粥，遠道跋涉，離開鄕井；可是，這其間同時也發生不少令人不愉快的事件，就是：</p>

<p>（一）發放麥粉，爲了脤濟機關人手的有限，不能不借重於鄉保長們，而鄉保長能奉公守法憑天良做事的固然有，其喪心病在，作奸犯科的，亦不乏人。於是，救濟署儘管是「非賑不生」，而麥粉仍有　進朱門的，流入黑市的。其幸而災民確曾領到一點救濟物品，又有今天領到了一斤粉，以後那年那月再領第二次之感，反不及一日兩餐粥來得實惠。由於「急賑」的推行，施粥廠停止了，其無力還鄕或在鄉所領的救濟物品無濟於事的災民，仍有流落在都市而以乞討爲生的。其他縣市不談，就在長沙市上來看，人行道上到處可見骨瘦如柴的饑民，有些奄奄待斃，有些餓斃在路旁或瓦礫靑草叢中，經過一兩天的時間，才用產蓆裹包移葬到郊外去。這眞是予救災工作一個莫大的諷刺。</p>
<p>三千噸粉　推存長沙不運</p>
<p>（二）災民是可憐的，而且是散居各地的，麥粉的來源他們不知道，他們能收到麥粉自然慶幸，沒有發下來，自然不會去索討。賑濟機關的辦事人員，在施粥時因爲災民聚在一處，容易滋事，不敢不按時把麥米下鍋；改爲「急賑」後，樂得從容辦理，因此其名雖「急」，實際反「慢」，於是，旬日前，長沙撈刀河有三千噸麥粉堆存不運的現象，救濟總署分配湖南的麥粉每月不過一千噸，而到長沙後竟堆存三千噸，不運往災區，實在有些令人不解。好在事經地方公正士紳組織的「湖南災荒急救會」知道了，在王主席官邸開了一個聚急會議，才把道三千噸麥粉陸續運出。</p>
<p>秋收有望　救災不容疏懈</p>
<p>湖南的救災，有人說已到尾聲了，因爲新豰已瀕登塲之期，今年雨水尚調，秋收後湖南的災荒自然消除。這種觀察，大致百分之九十以上是如此的，所以大家以爲湖南的救災，再經一兩個月的努力就可告一段落。其實，這種觀念未免太樂觀了一點。道種樂觀，會給予人們更痛苦的失望，譬如抗戰時期的種種艱苦，大家以爲一切祇要勝利，就會一掃而空，因此，對於勝利復員絲毫沒有打算，誰知復員後的艱苦，更有甚於職時。以爲秋收後湖南就入佳境的樂觀者，一定亦將陷入這個苦境。</p>
<p>現在，先來說湘省稻穀的收覆，平常豐收年成，據政府公佈的數字是一萬二千一百六十萬公石而消費量則爲一萬一千五百九十四萬公石，外加雜糧，湘省剩餘的米糧，不會超過四午萬石之數</p>
<p>今秋收獲　至多只有七成</p>
<p>今年湘省雨水雖調，可是收成決難十足，第一，收復區域荒田太多，未能及時復耕；第二，初春雨水失調，春耕失時，有能收穫兩次的田地，今年至多只有收獲一次的希望；第三，各地耕牛肥料種子及其他耕種資力，普遍缺乏，無力增加生產；第四，許多壯丁，被征陣亡，或尚未復員，减少耕種人數，第五，各地非脈不生的災民，如此普遍，救死小遑，只有聽任田土的荒廢；第六，農村經濟破產，農民多已棄農轉業，耕作能力更加減少。根據此種估計，今年至多只能有七成的收穫。可是，西汎時期尚未渡過，沙市水位已超過往年的最高紀錄，公安石首一帶的渡口，水已倒灌入湖，濱瑚垸田，岌岌可危，設有意外，收成仍無把握</p>
<p>根本之計　趕快復耕懇荒</p>
<p>就算天從人願吧，能有七成的滿收，則亦僅够本省消費，如果輸出一部份，抵償省外輸入物品之經濟，則仍不免有饑餓之民。再進一步說，豐收是地主收了去，饑民多屬於佃農階級，現在各地盛行買靑之風，借毅一石，秋收後還穀兩石至四石，眼望收成，都被盤剝而去。如果再來個「毂賤傷農」，那更不庸說了。這種情形，誰又能担保秋收後湖南就沒有災民呢！</p>
<p>根據上面的看法，我們認爲湖南的災荒正方興未艾，如何達到湘災消除的目的，那就不能不有望於賢明的省政當局，作一番遠大的根本打算。趕快設法復耕墾荒；積極整理沅資兩水；農貸要簡化手續，實際能到農民手裏。最後是二五減租，湖南應該切實而迅速的施行。能如此，則湖南的災荒，度過明年，乃有消除的希望。</p>
<h3 id="c127">法暹間的爭端 <a href="#c127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>— 高事恒</p>
<p>最近自法國重行踏上越南後，籍口搜捕叛徒，侵入暹羅邊界，暹羅亦不相讓，起而抵抗，同時向聯合國機構安全理事會聲訴。最近的發展，法國已顯明表示要索回一九四一年退羅所要返的土地，附帶條件要求暹羅交出一七七八年得自郎白拉邦希世綠玉佛一尊。世界雖已和平，大地尚滿佈火藥氣味，法暹之爭，是亞洲的事，可惜吾們自顧不暇，無法顧及，國人對此問題，或比較生疏，故特作此文以響者。</p>
<p>吾們首先須了解邊羅立國歷史雖不過六百餘年，她是一個小國，在太平洋戰爭以前，她是亞洲唯一個完全獨立自主的國家。暹羅於戰前稱爲泰國，戰後又改稱暹羅。泰族當初在吾國雲南大理建立南詔國，稱雄西南，於一二五四年被元朝所滅舉族南遷，驅高綿族而佔有現今之地。據歷史記載，她經過速古臺王朝大城王朝，吞武里王朝，及至現在統治暹羅之却克里王朝。最盛之時，其疆土領域，除本土外，擁有越南之西部，及馬來亞之北部。自一八二四年起，與英國訂立商約，爲歐洲人踏入暹羅之先聲，從此外交多事，百餘年來的歷史，幾完全爲歐洲人而寫。自却克里王朝拉瑪一世起，開始失地，初則失地與緬甸，繼則割讓與越南，自英法勢力伸入山南半島，暹羅成爲二國角逐之塲，至一九一〇年最末一次割地止，計一百十三年間惟兢兢應付於二國土地要求，尤其法國之要求頻仍，使暹羅疆土日蹙。及至第一次歐戰告終，暹羅與英法重訂條約廢除治外法權成爲獨立自由之國家，茲將暹羅歷來疆土變遷情形概述如左：（一）一七八五年緬甸侵入頓孫Tenasserim丹老塔瓦Tavoy三地，投入緬甸。（二）一七九一年藩邦柿武里與英國訂約租借檳榔嶼。（三）一八〇一年英國繼續租借檳鄕嶼Panang對岸一土地，英人稱爲威士利Willsley。(四)一八〇五年讓河仙（西貢之西南）與越南。（五）一八一二年越南伸勢力與柬埔寨Cambodia併而有之，惟至一八〇七年復歸入遏羅版圖。（六）一八二八年割猛潘　MeongPuan於越南。（七）一八六八年與法國訂約，柬埔寨歸法國保護。（八）一八七四年與英國訂約，霹盡Preak由英國統治，成爲馬來屬邦之一。（九）一八八七年讓十二點泰Sibsongchvthai及六侯地Hvapantanghok於法國。(十一)八八九年割怒江西北之地蘭那即百萬稻田部猛東猛榮等地於英。（十一）一八九三年法國以海軍駛入曼谷乃訂約割讓郎白拉邦Luangpraban及萬象Viengchan於法。（十二）一九〇三年割讓於法國湄公河西岸地及責巴塞Champasak。(十三)一九〇六年割讓於法國八打望Battamban暹叨Siemrap色利速蓬Sisbon國界東境之地。（十四）一九〇九年割吉打Kedah吉蘭丹Kelantan丁加奴Tringan璃琉市Perl四邦於英，併入馬來亞，作爲英國取消在暹治外法權之報酬。</p>
<p>故暹羅於一七八五年至一九一〇年間計失地十四次。又據暹羅史家記載，吾國雲南車里附近，亦曾隸屬暹羅，實屬錯誤。查車里於一三〇〇年時，元朝平其地，置徹里軍民總管府。徹里一作車里，此國包括車里及思茅二地，有時兼有其南境，不出雲南省外。（馮承鈞氏著西域南海失地考證譯叢馬司帛洛Georges　Maspero宋初越南半島諸國考）則車里在元時已隸中國版圖，作者茲便中作一聲明。（附暹羅彊界圖）</p>
<p>第二此世界戰起，其時暹羅正個唯國主義，以收復失地爲理由要求法國收回湄公河右岸之土地，法國拒絕要求，於是暹越戰爭。其時法國正甜於歡戰，無暇東顧日本勢力正伸入暹越，公然以亞洲主人自居，出而詞停，在東京舉行劃界會議，暹羅與法國維布政府訂立條的，劃割下列二地與暹羅。</p>
<p>（一）自東經1000至1020間北緯1050至200即北自淸功ChiengKhong附近Ban'Khwak至東角之Lvang　Prabang拖南下至Ban　Pak　Hoeang　湄公河上流之地。</p>
<p>（二）自東經1010至1050間北緯1230至　。即湄公河中流自　BanPakmvn附近南下經Bassac直截至Sisobon附近湖邊（Angkorva及湖除外）再下包括Battambang　及　Moung　至Khaosaming附近之Trht市。</p>
<p>太平洋戰事起暹羅受日本慫恿以吉打，吉蘭丹，丁加奴，玻璃市四邦劃歸暹羅自日本投降，上述四地，又歸還馬來亞之懷抱。談到綠玉佛，與吾國人有密切關係，道一尊寶物，原來是郎白拉邦Lvangprabang之諸侯維田國Wiengchan　又名　Vientiane（在湄公河右岸東經1020北緯180間）所有，是一座鎭國之寶，以錄玉雕成。一七七八年一位中國藉暹羅王—鄭昭，暹史稱爲吞武里王朝，取自郎白拉邦之維田。這位中國籍王帝，係潮州人，生長在暹羅，供職於大城朝庭，逢外寇侵入，鄭王時在軍中，驅逐敵人，削平諸侯，統一暹羅，於是被暹人擁戴爲王，於一七六八年正式即位。王尚武功，遠經略，國威之盛，爲暹羅歷史之創舉。一七八一年（乾隆四十六年）遣使入實中國，承認爲中國藩屬。一七八七年郎白拉邦之諸侯國維田，發生叛亂，其叛臣逃入邊境烏汶地方，維田侯越境捕殺之。王認爲使犯王權，發兵討之，破其都城，並獲希世之寶錄玉佛一尊，置之曼谷宮中。自此役征討平定，至一八九三年止，郎白拉邦及維田始終依附暹羅。</p>
<p>上述法暹互爭土地及玉佛原委，吾們以客觀立塲觀察，雙方爭執之土地原來屬於暹羅，而暹羅要回去，未始無立塲。法國之理由，以該項割地條約係一九四一年維希政府在日本壓迫之下所簽訂，不能承認，亦有理由。並反對聯合國干涉，願雙方直接談判。不過吾們不能否認，過去法國統治越南，操之一般荒謬的殖民地官吏，把土著親作牛馬使二千萬越南人民受奴役生活，戰後法國允許提高殖民地地位，使越南成爲聯合國一員，吾們以爲此種進步姿態，與法國有利益的。中國自日本投降後接收越南北緯十六度以北地區，而越南與中國有密切歷史關係，中國人民當然是關心這問題，但解決途徑，要看雙方如何發展，或聯合國是否接受暹羅的申請，受公理的判斷。至玉佛暹羅已保存一百餘年，且爲信虔佛敎之暹羅人民所尊敬，法國實在沒有素回的必要，故不過枝節問題而已。</p>

<p>— 七月廿七日臺灣航訊　本報特派員江暮雲</p>
<p>派往台東，澎湖，花蓮港和山地邊荒地帶的工作人員，都不願就職，這給予省民政處以莫大的難題。不單是民政處和警務處所訓練的人員，即經會計處訓練的學員，也不願離開本鄉。</p>
<p>民政處負責人親，這情形與陳長官在福建時相同，旋經嚴格限制，始慢慢消滅，但間省交通不便是實情，而台東各縣不能與之相較，於是擬定了兩項辦法：（一）分發人員不准飾辭　延。（二）由署規定輪流互調辦法。而會計處則採取派員到偏僻地區及需用較多的會計人員的地區舉行招考，或委託當地縣市政府代考。</p>
<p>陳畏官指出這個原因說：在日本佔領時代，雇員階級的人負多半雇用本地人，乃是顧全小職員負担不了家眷搬遷的設備和旅費，所以不要調委任以下的，而可以調薦任以上的，但須給予家屬遷移費。</p>
<p>緊縮經費　實行裁員</p>
<p>最近台省爲緊縮經費，各機關都實行裁員，主要的被裁對象，是各機關所雇用的不是下女的公務員，和成績不良的辦事人員。</p>
<p>糧食局一下裁撤了卅一位，自主任秘書以下，科長雇員都有，若干更受過嘉獎的。這卅一位以「辦事不力」之罪，被該局副局長林振成來代理局長時，予以撤職，他們除向長官報告外，並向法院提起訴訟，而被派調任，北平糧食特派員的吳長濤氏，又不能不趕回來處理局務了。</p>
<p>警務處長鄭重地提出。警告說：希望各機關多裁减行政人員，關於管理工廠及倉庫人員愈少栽態好。因爲他們熟悉內情，一經裁汰，變為盜竊，較難防範。</p>
<p>實際上最近臺北雖然發生過白盡搶刧專賣局員十萬元台幣和盜刧妙春醫院的事，但治安顯已納入正軌。不過小偸仍到處横行，因爲原有失業人多，最近又新添了整編軍隊的殘餘和被裁的人員，他們被迫於生活，只好鋌而走險了。</p>
<p>臺省特產　亟待救濟</p>
<p>台灣的特產，據農林處趙處長說，現在正亟待當局救濟：</p>
<p>鳳梨—民廿九年曾年產六十二萬一千一百五十九箱，今年預期可達入萬箱，台銀允借千七百萬元，已沒有問題。</p>
<p>茶葉—去年存茶二百萬餘斤無法運銷，成本擱煞，準備由貿易局收購，而過去百分之六十的物品稅率也已减低到和國內一樣了</p>
<p>香蕉—臺中今年產量約四十五萬簍，合計一萬公噸可銷省外，亟需要推銷出省。</p>
<p>禁止伐木—五年禁止伐木命令，發生了兩項困難：一是伐木商人的設備，不加利用，商人就受了損失，另一則增加失業工人。前者可以利用設備運輸山上存木，後者則發動以工代賑，令伐木工人從事森林治水並修理排水道</p>
<p>交通關係　殊欠協調</p>
<p>台省的交通，這一月間有三個星期是和省外絕緣的，它成了個名符其實的孤島，所幸目前連來了三艘自由輪，而松山飛機場跑道於十九日修復，航機又打通了滬台的空運。</p>
<p>關於飛機塲的事，空軍地區張司令說，台南機塲的地面設備—宿舍，無綫電台歡迎中航公司去借用，但中航公司却不去借用，反而從上海自己搬無錢常機來，結果躭誤了相當的時間。陳長官說：「雙方不能合作，如何得了—」</p>
<p>海關希望接收基隆高雄兩港務局，行政院也有命令，屬於海關部份的關棧，航路，標誌等，早由海關接管竣事，目前港務局所辦的船舶·丈量檢查等事，政府以爲與海關不相牽涉。所以決定兩個辦法而抉擇其一，即是電交部將台灣港務歸交通部統一管轄，一是等一二年將復舊工程辦好以後，再移交海關。</p>
<p>陳長官說：「希望省內各單位，務要密切聯繫，圓滿合作，不要犯同樣的毛病！」</p>

<h3 id="c133">兒童結核症 <a href="#c133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>— 陳銀河</p>
<p>我國對於兒童結核症，多不加注意，雖有抗癆運動等，其重心多在成人，而日常所見患結核症之兒實，有增無减，雖無正確之統計，但據一般醫院之估計，門診病人患結核者，有時佔百分之五十以上；而住院病人，有時竟佔百分之六七十；而兒童之死於此症者，更不可數計，最痛心而不易應偉者，爲結核性腦膜炎及粟粒形結核病。對此兩種結核症，可說絕對無辦法治癒。欲避免此類絕症之發生，當於事前嚴加預防。須知兒童爲民族之元氣，保持兒童之健康，即保持民族之元氣；兒童之夭折，即民族元氣之新傷，亦即國家之損失也。</p>
<p>病因</p>
<p>考結核症爲一種特殊而最普遍之傳染病，其主因爲結核桿菌侵入體內所致。其他如營養不良，貧困，過勞，環境汚濁，空氣不鮮，日光不足，睡眠不充，和患百日咳與痳疹等症後，致抵抗力减低，此可謂結核症之遠因。兒童最易受結核桿菌之侵襲，父母患結核症，尤其是母親，與兒童接觸機會最多，若不知隔離，而繼續對口哺物，或接吻，欲避免傳染者，可能乎！其他如乳母保母或近親，與兒童有接觸者，皆有傳染疾病之可能。</p>
<p>症状</p>
<p>結核桿菌分爲人牛二種：前者多由呼吸道傳染，後者多得自牛乳·結核桿菌之抵抗力，在人體外極强，在日光不足，空氣不暢，除暗潮濕之處，可生存數月至數年之久，但在烈日之下數日即死。其侵襲人體之路，可分三處，即呼吸道，消化道，及皮虘。後者最爲稀見。其患者或僅限於一部或普及全身，視各人體格之強弱與桿菌侵入數量及毒性有所區別。其侵襲人體，在潛伏期間，不易察覺。及到病成之後，始有病狀發現，而兒童之病狀，又不若成人之顯著。最普通之病狀，爲潮熱，咳嗽，食慾不振，性情暴躁，體重减輕或不增加，及貧血。兒童結核與成人之不同點，爲淋巴腺患者較衆，且具有强大之瀰散性，而病程之進行亦較速，初期結核每易於忽略，至發覺時，病已達緊要關頭，故此症發覺愈早，治愈之希望愈大，愈遲則希望愈少。</p>
<p>兒童結核症，簡約可分以下三類：（一）全身結核，包括肺部，腹部，骨骼，淋巴腺，及尿生殖器。其最後過程，爲結核性腦膜炎及粟粒形結核。（二）胸內結核，又可分爲初發性結核，肺門結核，結核性肺炎，胸膜炎，及粟粒形肺結核。（三）急性粟粒形結核病</p>
<p>在診斷上，兒童結核，首先須重視家庭歷史。家庭中如有患結核症者，兒童難以避免。其他爲結核菌素試騐，及愛克司光檢查。</p>

<p>欲知患結核症之兒童其結果如何，以下幾點有直接關係：（一）年齡愈小者愈凶，其病進行亦愈速。（二）其內外傳染之環境亦有關，家庭中有患結核病者，兒童有病上加病之可能。（三）患病之部位及種類，患結核性腦膜炎及急性粟粒形結核者，可謂毫無希望。（四）病兒原來之體質，體質强者較有治愈之可能。</p>
<p>治療</p>
<p>結核症至今無特效藥，其治療原則，乃在維持及增進身體之抵抗力。現今最普通之方法，約有下列數種：（一）普通療法：此中最主要者爲靜養療法。兒童患結核症者，每晚至少須睡足十至十四小時，午飯前休息片刻，午餐後午睡兩小時，而晚飯前又須休息片刻，不能運動過勞，兒童在家庭環境中，常不易得充足之休養。如有兒童療養院之設備者，則兒童除休養外，能兼施敎育。第二個普通療法爲新鮮空氣。新鮮空氣對於結核症之益處，人人皆知。患結核症者，最宜休養於戶外，一方面可得日光之治療。日光對於結核性淋巴腺炎與結核性皮膚病有特效。第三爲正當之飲食。正當之飲食，須節單而富有生熱力與維生素。新鮮疏菜，鷄蛋，牛奶，乳酪，及魚肉等，爲營養鹽富之食品。第四爲正當之醫學管理，兒童之體溫與體重，當日加注意，如遇感冒等症發生，須從速治療。總之兒童患結核症者，需隨時有醫生之指導。（二）特殊療法結核菌素之注射，曾經多種試騐，其結果不甚佳，故不能採用。最近美國雜誌所載之新藥鏈微素，（Strepomyciu）據說對結核病有效，其在動物試騐已有相當之成效，然在臨床上僅於一患結核性喉頭炎者，有良好結果，希望在不久之將來，各種結核症均有大量特數藥，俾爲病家造編。</p>
<p>預防</p>
<p>結核症旣無特殊之療法，而其爲書又如是之大，最重要者，莫如預防。西人有諺曰：「一　之預防，勝過一磅之洽療」·此乃醫理上不移之定論。兒童結核，亦當由預防入手。（一）對於已患結核症者之處。凡有結核症之可疑者，當早行診斷，而予以隔離。尤其母親患有結核者，更宜隨時注意，以免傳染子女。凡哺物接吻等惡習，尤宜避免。如痰中含有結核桿菌，更需隔離，因隨時有傳染之可能。病者之痰，及其所用之手巾衣物以及碗筷等物，皆當隨時消毒。（二）普通預防注（甲）敎育方面：我國敎育落後，尤其對於醫學常識，更不必談。如母親咀嚼後哺嬰兒，有病者與兒童接吻，諸如此類，常人以爲愛好之表示，實則爲傳播疾病之媒介。茍非喚起民衆注意其害，將永不能使結核症減少。至於提倡公共衛生，改良父母敎育，灌輸醫藥知識等等，尤屬目前急務。近來都市中已有防　運動，衛生展覽等，惜尚未普及於農村與　濺，此乃口家當局與社會人士須負責推　者。（乙）營養方面：營養不良，身衰弱，疾病　於侵襲，所以吾人必須注重適當營養。然在生產落後經濟破產之中國，實　提倡　當之營養耳。（丙）兒童體格檢查：對於兒童體格檢查，每年至少二次以上，不但能知健康進步如何，並可防患於未然。如本症發覺愈早，則治愈之希望愈多，愈遲則愈少，朱可以兒實無病徽而省却此　也。（三）特殊預防：B．C．G菌漿接種，已有極多報告，對於預防結核有相當成效。B．C．G菌漿爲樊性之活桿菌，無害於人體，而能刺激免疫體之產生。行皮下及皮內注射，能減少結核之患病率。凡未患結核病，而家庭中有傳染之可能性者，不妨試用之。</p>
<p>結論</p>
<p>總之結核症爲我國目前最維重問題之一，而影響所及，足以使國家元氣受損，人民壽命短促。本題範圍過廣，非三言兩語所能盡述。以上所述，不過爲最普通之常識，意在喚起閱者注意，使結核症在中國逐年減少，以至於無。此乃作者唯一之願望。</p>
<h3 id="c134">兒童心力衛生　睡眠問題 <a href="#c134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>— 劉瀹慈</p>
<p>凡是心理不健全的人，十之八九，都不得有正常的睡眠，由此可證明睡眠與心理的健康有着密切的關係，「習慣成自然」所以我們必須在兒童時期即養成一種良好的睡眠習慣，以促使其心身之發育均入於正常狀態，現在我們先就兒童的睡眠問題來加以險討。</p>
<p>失眠原因</p>
<p>兒童失眠的原因大都由於生病所致，但有時也由於不良習慣的造成以致不能有正常的睡眠。初生的嬰兒，健康者普通每日需睡約爲二十至二十一二小時之多，所以可說，嬰兒時期之三大部份時間是爲了睡眠而消耗，以後則隨年齡而遂减，如十歲左右的兒童則需睡眠十一二小時，而成人則有七八小時的酣眠已足，普通健康的兒童對於睡眠本無問題，然一般父母保母唯恐其兒童不能立即入睡，抱於懷中搖搖拍拍，促其速睡，道種不良習慣一經養成，日後如不這樣而再想使兒童睡去，實不可能，所以爲父母者欲使兒童有良好的睡眠習慣，則不可撫愛之過甚，祇要每到睡眠的時候，將兒童放於另屋另床上，則他們會自然循例的安然睡去。</p>
<p>不良慣例</p>
<p>試舉不良慣例——兒童每到五六歲的時候，有些父母因溺愛過甚，特別愼重他兒童的睡眠，如每到睡眠的時候·母親會牽着兒童的手到臥房去，關好窗怕有風吹進，替兒童將衣服脫掉，被蔣蓋好，怕他不易入睡，又講些有趣或驚奇的故事，直到兒童疲倦的時候，母親纔鬆了手還問兒童是否舒適，然後還像很不忍離去似的對他們說，「好實實，睡罷，母親在你的身邊，什麼也不要怕」這樣，又不惜厭煩的重覆巡視一下被褥窗戶等，然後才躡手躡足的離去，試想，如此應付兒童的睡眠，怎能不使兒童的依赖性增高，以後他們於睡眠時將非有這些儀式不可。又有的兒童當母親陪伴之後，恐怕母親離去，他們故意現出不寗之態，長此以往，兒童的依賴心理與日俱增，將使溺愛兒童的母親，愈覺兒童的睡眠爲一嚴重困難問題，兒童先是由難以入睡，而後漸成失眠，由失眠以致釀成將來成人時的種種不健全的心理狀態。</p>
<p>兒童於睡眠中常發現的許多病症，最普通的就是，</p>
<p>（一）夢魘（Night　mare，—患此病症的兒童於入睡幷不困難，所怪者就是他們常於好夢方酣之時，忽而呼叫驚嫂，其因乃是他們在夢中曾遇見了驚險的鏡頭，如爲猛獸所追，强盜所刦，或如登山入林等等，驚醒以後兒童可以　南的將夢中的遭遇描述得活現，且頗附人尋味。</p>
<p>（二）夜驚（Night　terror)—其在夢中驚醒後的種種驚駭表現，與上述之夢魘覺無大差異，所不同者即兒童於驚醒後對於環境人物幷無任何認識，待其懼駭表現之後，兒童仍能安然入睡，如次日問他前夜恐懼之何爲，他們大都不能記憶。</p>
<p>（三）夢行（Sleep－walkinｇ），則爲於睡眼中突然起立或行走於他處，或作些平日常作之事，如主婦則會於該時整理房間，學生則會開啓　櫥，閱讀醫報，雖然他們在夢行中常是緊閉變目，可是他們却能做出很機巧的妙事，許多人都以爲夢行是爲神怪所驅，其實夢行與夢魔夜驚等均是大同小異，全是兒童關於睡眠的心理病症，與迷信根本無關。對於夢行最應注意的就是特別减少，兒童於睡眠前數小時中的種種刺激，其次爲患夢行的自身安全起見，務使他們不住樓房，以免於夢行時誤走樓梯，會因不自覺的疏忽而墮落受傷。</p>
<p>（四）其他　此外如昏昏欲睡，永現倦意，等等睡症，其因素很多，或爲嗎啡（Morphine)及溴化物（Bromide）之中毒，或因曾患腦炎（Encephalitis）所致，心理方面的睡症，如個性之過於懶惰，每日非有一二十小時的睡眼不可，那最好同心理治療家檢討一下，較爲有益。</p>
<p>總之，睡眠可以調和吾人身體輿心理的健康，夜間如無充足睡眠，白日則不能振精工作，兒童的睡眠時間，應有規律，不可從寬例外，更不必看護兒童睡眠有如參加大典，應使兒童視睡眠爲一種簡易而自然的行爲，使其自知睡眠之益處，不可因責罰兒童而令其先行入睡，如此可使其有憎恨睡眠之感，不可使兒童依賴父母，應於幼童時即開始敎其自行穿衣習慣，更不可以陪伴與講故事爲催眠劑，如此則兒童的睡眠病症自必次第减少，睡眠充足，兒童的心身發育當入於正常狀態，心理健康的養成當無異議矣。</p>

<h3 id="c135">防「奶癆」 <a href="#c135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>— 斐</p>
<p>我國嬰兒，往往於斷乳後，有消化不良，多哭，面黄肌瘦等症。夏日則更因煩躁少睡而患疾病。使其父母日夜不安。俗稱「奶癆」，在醫學方面言之。即由於斷乳前未有充分之預備，而斷乳後又營養不足之故，實即營養不良之症狀。</p>
<p>我國　養嬰兒，以人乳爲主要食物，頗有母乳不足而添僱乳母者。人乳對於嬰兒之優點，不勝枚舉，茲不贅述。六個月以下嬰兒得足量人乳喂養者，其增長發育幾可與歐美嬰兒並駕齊驅，並無不及之處。但六個月後，則我國嬰兒生長發育漸緩，輒有停滯者，較諸歐美嬰兒，自歡弗如矣。著者曾於湖南長沙，檢查嬰兒數千名，製成圖表曲錢，以與歐美相較，而獲上述之結果。</p>
<p>乳類爲嬰兒最優良最合式之食品，但其所含營養素，尚有若干缺製。如缺乏錢質及數種維生素，爲其最顯著者。是故乳類餵哺，最多祇能應付六個月以下嬰兒之需要·實則嬰兒必須按時添授各種副助食物，方能有正常之生長發育。</p>
<p>我國嬰兒大都全恃人乳餵養有直至一二過歲者。如此餵養方法，不但生長發育，瞠乎人後，且因營養不良，抵抗力薄弱，而有疾病叢生之患。嬰兒脚氣病，貧血，傷風，咳嗽，腹瀉等等皆是也。試看小小嬰兒，患此種種疾病，無怪其生長發育之遠不如人。</p>
<p>預防之法甚爲節易，只須按時加入輔助食物。輔助食物即乳類以外之嬰兒營養食物。</p>
<p>（一）一月至四月</p>
<p>一月左右嬰兒，即宜添授橘子汁，菜湯，乾酵母粉及魚肝油等，以補充甲乙丙丁維生素。橘子汁富於丙種維生素，一月嬰兒每日可授予橘子汁三次，每次一至二茶匙。維生素B之供給，爲便利起見，往往取用乾酵母粉，每日三次，每次半公分。城市嬰兒之不能常得日光者，更須添授魚肝油，一日三次，每次半茶匙漸加至一茶匙；或魚肝油濃液，每日三次，每次五至十滴。</p>
<p>（二）五月至六月</p>
<p>五月以上嬰兒，食量漸大，消化力亦漸强，且將屆出牙之期，除流質外，當添授易於消化之半流質食物。小米粥，大米粥，麥片粥等，皆可應用。五六月嬰兒，每日可餵粥兩次。起先每次一湯匙，漸加至四湯匙。</p>
<p>（三）七月至十月</p>
<p>乳類缺乏鐵質，前已論及。足月初生嬰兒之肝臟，貯有多量鐵質，生後至六個月，鐵質大半取給於此。六個月後，所貯鐵質，漸次告竭，若純餵以乳類，及其他缺乏鐵質之營養品，則必致貧血。菠菜，鷄蛋黄等，皆富於鐵質，皆可漸次添授。凡嬰兒初次添食鷄蛋者，必須先授予蛋黄，若數日後無恙，然後可食整個鷄蛋。蓋有少數小兒，對於蛋白，有過敏反應者</p>
<p>綠色，黄色，紅色，凡有色菜蔬，不僅富有鐵及維生素，且有潤腸之功用，水菓亦然。七月嬰兒，能食菜泥，九十月嬰兒，亦能食熟水菓泥。菜泥與水菓泥，可以代替橘子汁與白菜水。</p>
<p>（四）十一月至兩造</p>
<p>此時已屆停乳之期。支配食物方法，無非將飲食次數减少，食物漸次替換，由流質，而半流質，以至各種柔軟食品，以適合兒童生理之變化，而達正常之發育。</p>
<p>所謂輔助食物，並非補充人乳或牛奶的量之不足，乃以補充人乳或牛乳的質之不足，以供給嬰兒各時期生長發育之需要。若母乳不足者，當補以牛乳，無力購買牛乳者，可購豆漿以代之。而牛乳豆漿，仍不可以替代副助食物，純用牛乳而不添授副助食物者，可以發生同樣之症狀。</p>
<p>在我國社會中，發現所謂「奶癆」者極多，若不及早矯正，確有發生疾病或甚至不治者。是以倣防癆爲題，簡述防「奶癆」之原則及方法，以供獻於有斯症嬰兒之父母。</p>

<h3 id="c136">今後的出版事業 <a href="#c136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>— 王平陵</p>
<p>京中人士於日前開會祭悼葉公楚傖時，筆者滯渝未歸，不及參加；特作此文，紀念葉氏提偶中國文藝運動的成就，並將此文稿費，捐作萊氏獎學金。　作者附誌</p>
<p>一·出版物何以無銷路？</p>
<p>假定按照中國人口的比例，每千人中就有一個人願意買盡，看書，則一本比較像樣的書，就可銷到四十五萬册；但現在每本書的平均銷路，（指較好的作品而言。）祇有二千本，約計滿二十萬人，買書者僅有一人，這就是說，如果，全上海的人口是三百萬，那麼，作爲出版物的顧客，不過十五個人，中國出版物銷路之不景氣，眞令人大吃一驚！這樣鐵一般的事實，横在大家的眼前，即在一味抱殘守缺的『骸骨迷戀者』，都無法自傲的。</p>
<p>根據出版物銷路之不景氣，可以證明中國好學深思之士，實在太少；而文盲的數字，過去是估有百分之八十八以上，現在是不是已經减少，還須待考。</p>
<p>出版物何以無銷路？我想，決不是此刻購買力薄弱之故，因爲在戰前出版物的銷路，比此刻還不如；而舶來品較從前高出數萬倍生意依舊特別興隆。我們必欲使這問題獲得實確的解釋，當還有下列諸種原因在：</p>
<p>（一）由於出版物銷路的停滯，稿費低廉，版稅無望，使各部門的作家，未克安貧樂道，影響到出版物的內容，不能與時俱進，這便直接妨碍了出版物的銷路。</p>
<p>（二）社會的生活水準，過份低落，多數的老百姓，並沒有被時代逼迫着到了非具有一點知識和技能無法存在的程度，就是僅賴原始的體力，起碼的經騐，也能苟延殘喘。他們自然是願意識字讀書的；但要勉强找尋識字的機會，好像尚無必要。</p>
<p>（三）出了學校的大門，已混跡在社會各降層的知識份子，很少應用到學校裏學習的東西，充其量不過把熟悉的幾個方塊字，作爲通訊，看報，寫幾句打油詩，或撰擬訃文，碑銘及等因奉此的工具，藉以敷衍現狀而已！甚至連普通常識，都極少用得着的時候，比較專門的技能，高深的學術，在此刻還是一種高貴的奢侈品，因此，中國一般的知識份子，覺得識字已够，何必讀書！</p>
<p>（四）內地風氣閉塞，交通不便，新出版業都擁塞在各大商埠及首都所在地，不容易把新出版的書刋，流傳到窮鄉僻壤，普及到文化的「不毛之地」。在估全人口百分之八十以上的農民所散佈的鄕村，是多麽一塊廣大的面積；但從沒有人設法散播「讀書的種子」，努力掃除文盲，靈設小學，多多創立農村博物館及圖書館；所以中國廣大的農村，還是沿襲太古的遺風，生活在半開化的狀態裏，你就是把現代的新出版物，千里迢迢，按期奉送，他們也不會拜嘉的。</p>
<p>（五）住在都市裏的官員，公司銀行的職員，在過去雖也算是出身於學校，也號稱是知識份子：可是旣進了衙門及公司，僅爲了敷衍公事，歌舞爭逐，巴結上司，應付同僚，已經是鈎心鬥角，忙得够受，那裏還有好整以暇的閒情逸緻溫故而知新呢？即有自命爲專家，學者的官員，倘在官塲中混得過久，他們自己也承認：「荒疏了！過去學習的東西全拋了！」</p>
<p>（六）有些撈勝利財發國難財的暴發戶，以及這些人專爲尋開心而娶來的嬌妻，愛妾，軋上的舞侶和情婦，是一切爲享受，「享受」就是生活的唯一目的：如果遇到刺激「性機能」的淫慾寳鑑，强調「色情在」的黄色讀物，大腿電影，眼睛吃冰淇淋的戲劇，他們在玩沙蟹，打麻雀，覺得煩厭，也許能偶爾涉獵，聊以排悶的。至於所有與「享受」無關的書，即可以增加知慧和人絡修養的書，在這些人是不屑一顧的。</p>
<p>根據上述事實，我們就不必懷疑中國人爲什麼不讀書的道理了。</p>
<p>同時書店裏汗牛充棟的書，倒是那些毫無價值的壞書，不至於無人間津，大有一批熱愛的龐主在期待着，實在並非無因·</p>
<p>二·長此以往，如何得了！</p>
<p>「唉！長此以往！如何得了！」我常聽見少數憂心世道的志士仁人，目擊中國文化的幼穉與沒落，這樣仰天浩嘆着。不過，這一羣憂心者僅知浩嘆而已，並不知道這情形當眞延長下去，對社會究能發生怎樣惡劣的影響。我願意再來分析一下：</p>
<p>（一）誰都知道，這一次世界大戰，完全是文化戰，科學戰：凡文化沒落，科學幼穉的國家，祗有滅亡，絕無倖免。中國人假使永遠托庇祖先的遺蔭而自豪，不迎頭趕上世界文化的水準，不積極提高科學的智慧，則中國賴以立國的科學和文化，必永無振作的希望。</p>
<p>（二）有些投機取巧一無所知的幸遝兒在社會裏鬼混了些時候，一旦時來運來，照樣能發財，昇官發財，名利雙輝，受盲目者的擁護，得輿論的讚揚，那麼，誰都不是傻瓜，又何苦把用於昇官，發財成名的時間，耗費在科學試騐室，圖書館中，寫字臺上呢！反正，學向愈高深，試驗愈成功的人，愈沒有出路，甚至求免於凍餒尚不可能，又何必自討苦吃呢，作惡是人類共有的「天才」旣然作惡者有幸運，誰不會作惡呢！</p>
<p>（三）科學的昌明學術的建立，都要有幾十年的研討，國家多方的培植，才有開花結菓的可能，並不是一蹴可就。現在純正的學風，未能養成，誰都是選取終南捷徑，急求富貴，或利用「反社會」的心理，標新立異，騙取浮名。千千萬萬做父兄的，看見那些人的投機取巧靑雲直上，就寗可把自己的子弟送進銀行當練習生，拜權門做乾爺，怎能使社會不視學校爲牢獄，等學問如弁髦呢！我們祗要明白這三個可能發生的危機，便足使關心世道的人們，要立即拿出實確的辦法來，解救這一個足可亡國滅種的禍根了！徒然長吁短嘆，有什麽用啊！</p>
<p>三·怎樣挽救出版界的厄遝？</p>
<p>出版機構在內地，感受極大的損書，瀕於一蹶不振的窘狀；戰時我們正竭全力於最後勝利的爭取，實無暇在荒涼的廢墟上重播精神文明的種子，以期再開燦爛的花，結碩大的菓。同時，我們的國際路綫，在某一時期受困於日寇，旣封鎖了我們物資的互助，又障礙了我們精神的交流，在整整的八長年內，歐美出版的新書，不論是科學·哲學和文藝，幾已完全斷絕了來源。文化因彼此比較，互相觀摩，才有進步；似此長期隔膜，失去協作和聯絡，我們的文化界縱能在戰爭中不甘落後，多少也有一點成就；但決無法塡滿空虛，抵償戰爭所帶來的損失。今後誠欲挽救出版業的危機，例如：充實精神的來源，溝通文化的交流，改善出版的條件，提高作家的待遇，固然十分重要；而使各部門的作家有較好的環境，能够讓他們安坐下來，抽一部份時間再學習，更求充實自己，是尤爲迫切的。</p>
<p>在戰時的出版界，多半受了高物價的壓迫，和生活動亂的痛苦，不容易按照合理的出版計劃，接受各部門的著作，他們爲了避免因蝕本而關門，不能不注意到「生意經」，站在「賺錢第一，文化第二」的立塲，選取出版的稿件，因爲這樣，據出版界的經騐。科學，專門著作物的銷路，遠不如文學，文學之中，詩歌不如小說，小說不如走運的劇本，而採用文藝的形式，透過文學的手法所寫出的「處世經驗，成功秘訣，戀愛哲學，情書一束……」這一類的　，其行銷之速，實尤在走運的劇本之上；所以，在戰時，以科學的出版率爲最低。出版界未能把握時代的重心，配合國策的需要，這也是出版業不景氣的原因。當着另一個大時代——爭取和平建設的大時代，正在開始的今天，我們出版界也應該變變作風了！　（未完）</p>
<h3 id="c137">我哭了 <a href="#c137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>— 雪華</p>
<p>昨天半夜裏醒來的時候，發覺半個枕頭是濕的，伸手到臉上去摸摸，滿臉都是淚水，原來我眞的哭了。</p>
<p>我哭了，這有什麽希奇？這幾年中，特別這半年來，我的眼淚已像霉天的雨水，只要一息兒微風，一點兒小雲，就會連綿不斷地向下落着，落着，落入茫茫無際的悲哀的汪洋。</p>
<p>我做了一個古老的夢，希奇的夢。——</p>
<p>夢裏的情境完全跟二十年前一樣：我穿着一身白底藍花短衫褲，頭髮用紅色的頭繩紮成兩條小辮。我站在一間敞亮的屋子裏。小小的身體，倚着一隻八仙桌的檯角。小小的眼睛，望着脚下一隻尾巴很粗的獅子貓。小小的耳朵，聽着一個慈愛的聲音：</p>
<p>「我要去了，下次路過無錫時再來看你。你在這裏，總要聽從義父母的話，更要用功讀書，將來可以做一個有用的人，聽見嗎？」</p>
<p>當然我聽見，我也懂得，我更明白。我的幼小的心靈在顫抖地說：</p>
<p>「寄父，我知道了！我一定聽你的話，要服從他們，要用功讀書，要做一們有用的人！」</p>
<p>但是我竟沒有這樣說，我「啊」的一聲哭了！——</p>
<p>就在這個時候我醒來的吧？我的臉上枕上全是淚水，原來我眞的哭了。</p>
<p>我哭了，這有什麽希奇？我的眼淚已像霉天的雨水，只要一息兒微風，一點兒小雲，就會速綿不斷地向下落着，落着，落入茫茫無際的悲哀的在洋。</p>
<p>然而這時候，我哭了，我哭得和平常有些兩樣！</p>
<h3 id="c138">樹 <a href="#c138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>— H．Hesse作　馬御風譯</p>
<p>Hesse是現代德國著名的作家，但不是納粹文人，所以還十分值得介紹。「樹」譯自日文本「放浪與懷鄕」一書。—譯者</p>
<p>在我看來，樹永遠是最痛切的說敎者。樹結成民族，結成家族，結成森林而生活着的時候，我尊敬樹，但樹孤獨地立着時候，我更加尊敬牠。樹好像孤獨者——不是那些軟弱的，逃避的隊士，而是像悲多汶和尼采那樣的，偉大的孤立的人。世界在牠的梢頭喧嚷，牠的根在「無限」之中休憩。但樹不是完全沉沒於無限之中，他舉起生命的一切力量，只想努力去完成一件事情，即想實現宿於樹中的自身的法則，作成他本來的姿態，表現自己自身。沒有像一棵美麗的强大的樹那樣神聖和棋範的了。一棵樹被鋸子鋸倒了，把他的新鮮的傷口在太賜裏曝晒，在他的斷株，即在他的基表的光滑的平面上，可以讀出樹的全體的歷史。所有的戰門所有的苦惱，所有的疾病，所有的幸福和繁榮，都忠實地記在年輪和疤痕上——小的年齡和大的年齡，不能抵抗的攻襲和忍受過的暴風。並堅硬高貴的樹子，有最密的年輪，最强大的理想的樹幹，是在高山上和不斷的危險之中生長的，這些事情，隨便那個鄕下的小孩都懂得。</p>
<p>樹是神聖的東西，能够和樹說話，和傾聽樹的人，會懂得眞理。樹不說敎訓和做法。樹不介介於個別的東西，而說生命的根本法則。</p>
<p>一棵樹說，「我裏面　藏着一粒核，一星火花，一個思想。我是永遠的生命。永遠的母親由造我而做的試驗和企圖，是永刧。我的形狀和紋理，是永刧。我的頂上的顫動的葉子，我的皮上小小的疤痕，也是永刧。我的工作是在這有特徴的永刧之中，形成永遠。」</p>
<p>一棵樹說，「我是信念。我不知道自己的祖先，也不知道每年從自己身出生的幾千個孩子。我相信神住在我自身裏面，我相信自己的工作的神聖。因了道種信念，我生活着。」</p>
<p>當我們覺得悲哀，不能忍受生活時，也許有一棵樹會向我們說，「靜點吧！靜點吧！看我的樣子！生活沒有快樂，或生活沒有困難，還樣的話是小孩子的想法。請說在你裏面的神吧，那樣的想法就沉默了。你不要担心，你的路會把你遠離母親和故鄕，而是一步一步，一天一天，重新把你帶到母親的地方去。故鄉不是在這邊或那邊，故鄕在你裏面，否則，什麼地方也沒有故鄕。」</p>
<p>薄暮，一聽到樹在風中搖響，浮浪的憧憬就攪動我的胸懷。長久靜聽。浮浪的憧憬就現出牠的核心和意味來，這不是一瞥所見的那樣，想逃避煩惱，而是向故鄕的，向母親的記憶，向生命的新姿態的憧憬。這是回家，一切的路都是回家。每一步是誕生，每一步是死亡。一切的墳墓都是母親。</p>
<p>當我們在自己的稚氣的想頭裏抱着不安時，樹在晚風中搖響着葉子，這樣說了。如同樹有比我們更長的生命一樣，樹也有深長的思想。只有我們不聽樹時，樹　比我們賢明，反之，學習向樹木傾聽，則那時我們思想的缺點，慌亂，和稚氣的悲哀，都可以得到無比的喜悅。學習向樹木傾聽的人，不是希望變成樹木，也不是想希望變成自己以外的東西。自己自身，就是故鄉，就是幸福。</p>

<p>（一）司徒病</p>
<p>司徒雷登火使微恙·我們中國人特別覺得抱歉，對於這一位七十一高齡的老朋友，往返奔波，不辭勞瘁，山上山下，凉凉熱熱，都在傷腦筋，而今累出病來了，如何過意得去。因爲司徒的病，令我們更替另一位老人馬帥担心，我們由衷祈禱司徒能早日恢復律康，更願爲帥能多多保重！</p>
<p>不過我們願意特別提出一點供兩老參考的，誰是誰非，誰在存心搗亂，旣然明明白白，就索性公開出來，否則徒然耗費精神，結果而不能圓滿，實在不值得！</p>
<p>（二）父親節</p>
<p>定八月八日爲父親節，意義深長，誰無父母。誰無子女，任何人都會贊同的。而且在去年抗戰勝利前發起這運動的，更有「明爲祝福父親之舉，暗示懷念祖國之意，東郡旣淪，萬民猶自思蜀一，用心深苦。</p>
<p>社會澆薄，人心不古，在祗講利害的今日社會風氣之下，父親節更有發揚民族道德的作用。報德尊親，願大家能以「此身自何而來」爲念。</p>
<h3 id="c141">怪胎 <a href="#c141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>— 子葉</p>
<p>四手·四足·兩個頭，一頭吃着奶一頭睡着覺。</p>
<p>五六日前，本村傳來了一件奇聞，謂南岙地方某產婦生下一孩子，二頭四足和四手，深以爲怪。後來，有人特往看過，除證明所傳說係事實外，更帶來許多怪之又怪的消息。</p>
<p>一奇怪極了！那孩子有四個腎子（睪丸）而僅有一個尿道」。他得意地做着手勢說：「吸奶的口兩張而撒糞的孔（、肛門）僅一個。</p>
<p>「這樣的怪胎，世界上少有，前幾天我從昨報上看到：日本某地方產一怪胎，是世界上己知者的第二個。那末，你的應當是第三個了。「屋主人聽了我的話，似乎很欣喜。</p>
<p>末後，我告訴他們，怪胎是受精卵分裂尚未完全的關係，並非如何不吉利，且允許代寫新聞稿寄至各報上發表。</p>
<p>「老公公，好好的養育這一個嬰孩！」離開他家的時候，我夭着，說了這麼一句。</p>
<p>「千聞不如一見」，「活老虎尚且要看，何况此難得的怪胎」。好奇心激發我，必須去看個究竟。於是約了堂叔，于昨日下午，特地跑到了那邊。</p>
<p>進去的時候，屋主人剛坐在門檻上與另外三四人談着話，見了我們，即問來意和住址，我完全告訴了他。</p>
<p>「本來不給你們看，因爲你們是金山塘人，彼此有交往，姑且讓我叫嫂嫂抱出來」。在如此的許可下，我們期待着。</p>
<p>一會兒，產婦慢鈍鈍地抱着嬰孩踱到房外，然後坐在門檻上。她的年紀約摸四十來歲，頭髮逢亂，眼光乏力，臉孔白而帶黄，彷彿一張土產毛邊紙。身上穿着一件黑洋布衫，極爲破舊。她有氣沒力地解開裹着嬰孩的舊衣服，向我們說：</p>
<p>「嘹，你們請來看」。</p>
<p>於是衆人圍了攏來，我跑得難嬰孩最近，略俯下了身體，端詳着這舉世罕有的寳貝。</p>
<p>該嬰全身長約一尺五寸，不胖也不瘦，皮膚微帶粉紅色。頭果眞二個，毫不相連；二副臉孔很相仿，同樣大小，同樣形狀，儻不細看詳察，實令人難以分辨。身體上半截各自分開，每個胸部，都能獨立呼吸。與四手各從肩頭長出，與通常的孩子沒有分別。</p>
<p>看到這裏，我好奇地向產婦問了一聲：「哭的時候，兩個同時哭的嗎」？以後我知道這句問話，實在太笨。</p>
<p>「那裏」！她搖一搖頭。「就是一個在吃奶，另一個常會在睡覺呢」。</p>
<p>嬰孩的腹部左右並連，臍孔位在中間，僅一個。生殖器上距臍扎約三四寸，適當第二與第三兩脚的交接處，內有四個睪丸，各向下垂。全體彷彿四個葡萄，然陰莖僅有一個，所有嬰尿，都從此而得外流。雖則頭部有二張口可以吃食，而排洩的肛門却仍然合一。</p>
<p>我們詳細地看了數分鐘，堂叔恐嬰孩受凉，請產婦裏好襁褓。我們仍走回到原來的地方，和屋主楊春輝先生（嬰孩的祖父）略談了其他的一些話，又重拉話題至這嬰孩身上了。</p>
<p>「道孩子生了多久」？我一問。</p>
<p>「十二天了」，他回答我，並機績說：「當時，我們見如此怪狀的嬰孩，認爲不吉利，有把它弄死的意思。後來，×君同我說：「春輝，這孩子是無價之寳啊」！因而把它養到了今天」。</p>
<p>「眞的，假使拿到上海大世界的話，就是五百元一票，也有許多人要來看」，剛從上海回來的堂叔插口說。</p>

<p>— 東方荊</p>
<p>美國大學中，流行這樣一個故事：某敎授沒有準時來上踝，不過，在上課之前他是來過的，因爲他的帽子還放在桌子上。也許是有甚麼事出去了。可是等了足足十五分鐘，還沒見他來。學生們不耐煩了，都一一散去。</p>
<p>下一堂，該敎授實佈說，上一課全班缺課，他都記下來了。</p>
<p>學生們抗議說：「是你自己沒來啊，我們足足等了十五分鐘。」</p>
<p>「可是，」敎授反駁說，「我的精子放在桌上啊，這和我自已在這裏一樣。」</p>
<p>鄕論就到此終止了。</p>
<p>下一次，這位敎授來上課時，敎室裏空空如也，一個學生也沒有。</p>
<p>但，在每把椅子的正中，都端端正正地放了一頂帽子。</p>
<h3 id="c143">路上傳敎的老人 <a href="#c143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>— 又娟</p>
<p>每天早上，在靜安寺電車站排了隊等電車時，總看見一個老年人，一手拿着一面畫着紅十字的白旗，一手挾着一本聖經，拉直了嗓子在講基督的道理。「快來信耶穌，相信耶穌有永生，不信耶穌要滅亡。人類沒有本領，中國自己也沒用，都是靠着耶穌才能生存的，許許多多的偉人都信耶穌，你們也要信。」有時候，雖然他的嗓子已經呌得沙啞了，但是他還是拼命的講，好像是非呌得一個電車站的人都信不肯罷休似的。可是他這樣的講究竟有沒有用呢？唉！嘲笑他的人多，同情他的人少，眞是可憐。</p>
<p>有一天，有一個外國人，不懂他在講些什麼，以爲他是一個要飯的，給了他五百元，他沒有受，說道：「我是來傳福音的，並不是來討錢的，請您收回吧！」外國人給他講得莫明其妙，車站上的候車人都笑了起來。</p>
<p>當這位老人在講時，我曾經留意傾聽前前後後的人說話，把他們摘錄於下。</p>
<p>「他是靠耶穌吃飯的，我們不靠耶穌，我們爲什麽要信耶穌？」</p>
<p>「這老頭兒眞發瘋了，什麼耶穌不耶穌的，一天講到晚，難道就不怕累嗎？」</p>
<p>「這人，我看他自己也不懂，還要來敎別人呢！」</p>
<p>「給道種人來講耶穌的道理，耶穌眞給他丟盡了臉了。」</p>
<p>「哈哈！還說相信耶穌有飯吃，看他長得這付瘦相，不知他自己飯吃得飽吃不飽呢？」</p>
<p>「中國會去靠耶穌？中國靠了耶穌中國早就亡掉了，眞是沒有知識的東西。」</p>
<p>總之，各式各樣的嘲笑話，差不多沒有一天不聽見的。</p>
<p>道位老人，年紀已經很大了，却還是這麼的不辭勞苦，無論是烈日當空，成者是傾盆大雨，不怕人家的嘲笑，也不怕人家咒駡，他總是站在那兒，拉着破節的嗓子，喊着，呌着，從來也沒有一天間斷過。無論他請得怎樣的不中聽，無論他的話是怎樣的不技巧，但他道種大無畏的精神，我們都應該佩服，效法。把他的這種精神，也用到我們的事業上去，這樣，他才可算沒有白講，我們也可算沒有對不起他了。</p>
<p>我祝這位老人身體健康！</p>
<h3 id="c144">何必文飾 <a href="#c144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>— 佑芙</p>
<p>轟動全滬的路局一萬萬餘元的大舞弊案，據各方的報導，遺次舞弊案的主角，是材料處處長張鴻圖的妻子，一個曾經掛牌做過僞律師的郁香嚴女士。</p>
<p>道個鐵的事實，是地檢處根據許多的調查以及收到控訴密告的信所斷定。</p>
<p>然而，據郁香嚴的親筆信，却幾乎令人很同情她脆弱女子的處境，同情她那奉公守法康潔的丈夫。誠如地檢處方面所說：「郁香嚴即使不能說是主犯，而旣和本案主犯張鴻圖是夫婦關係，當然是正犯之一。信中所謂簽呈揭發舞弊，好像推得很乾凈，但郁香嚴旣然居心無他，何以又避不見面？本處當然有事實根據，然後才檢舉他們！」</p>
<p>是的，我覺得王處長的話說得很有道理，俗語云：「日間不做虧心事，夜里敲門不吃驚」，原使郁香嚴女士確實是一個好人，與該案毫無關係，爲何避而不見，而只寫一封信來自辯？這不是一個極可疑的地方嗎？這不是更增加她的「不利」嗎？</p>
<p>曾記得當蘆溝橋戰事爆發後，平津危急，宋哲元等高級將領都退出來了，惟有天津市市長張自忠將軍不走，於是，全國的人們，個個懷疑他，他却很泰然，並不介意，終究回到了南京。後來，蔣委員長也很了解他的苦衷，安慰了他一番。可是，人們依舊懷疑着他。直到他轉戰南北，建立奇功，拱衛襄樊，負傷不退堅守寸土，以身殉於國最前結，明白表明了張自忠將軍的心。</p>
<p>從此，事實答復了一切。</p>
<p>靠一對信的狡辮，而避不到庭，這方法將永遠不能表白她自稱的純潔的心。事實勝雄辯，何必文飾？</p>

<p>— 許桂庭</p>
<p>國藥在美國是很出風頭的。在紐約城的中心區裏就有兩間很有名氣的藥材店。成千成萬的美籍華僑總不會忘記他們的祖宗數千年流傳下來的醫藥。保濟丸就是普通用以療治腸胃病的萬靈藥。它是集合數味普通藥草而製成的。隨便什麼人如果頭量身熱。傷風咳嗽，腸胃失調，胸悶腹痛，立刻吞吃一兩瓶普濟丸，則其病若失，其效如神，連到美國人看見了，也不得不嘖嘖稱奇。</p>
<p>美國朋友大感興趣</p>
<p>有一位美國朋友，名叫奧本哈姆（Biatrice　Oppenheim），對於我們的國藥開始發生興趣。他就跑到紐约城裏的中國藥材舖去訪問一番。據他說，在那店裏的窗櫃上陳列了無數種類的藥材，如漂白的海馬骨，曬乾的昆蟲，虎鬚，蟹眼睛，鹿角，海草，樹葉，樹根，以及野獸的骨頭等。正是琳琅滿月，美不勝收！</p>
<p>在太平洋戰事進行的當中，美國的華僑患起病來，因爲沒有國藥進口的緣故，祗好勉强進服西藥如亞斯匹靈，咳藥水和硫磺劑之類。不過最近，那些中國藥材店又從「唐山」（華僑稱呼祖國的名詞）運到大批眞材實料的國藥了。全美國差不多有一百處的「唐人街」，（Chinatown），那裏的華僑都喜出望外地歡迎祖國運來的聖藥。</p>
<p>華僑藥商頗懂宣傳</p>
<p>那藥材店的老聞告訴奧本哈姆「你們的美國藥製於我們似乎沒有敝國的藥材那麽靈驗罷。」然而另方風，中國的藥材店，却被法律禁止出售那些藥品於白種人。</p>
<p>那藥材店裏便囤積了四百多種藥材。無論那一種都沒有標明特殊的記號。但是那個老　却能舉手一揮，檢出任何一種，連看也不看，就能够辨明其種類及其用途。在窗櫃裏陳列着價值連城的人參，每一小片，居然要賣到美金四十元至九十五元的高價倡不信由你，人參是化弱爲强，起死回生的妙藥。一個人沒有丈夫氣，可以試一試人參湯，飲了馬上精神奕奕，脫盡病夫的頹唐氣象。當你患病的時候，人參能够帮助你活血提神，並且導引其他藥味直達患處，驅除病魔。美國的華僑就是死也相這一套的。</p>
<p>還有更名貴的是一雙鹿角，標價美金二千五百元。這種藥材是切成薄片來零售的，把它煎湯來飲，據說可以「活血養榮。」</p>
<p>那位老　滔滔不絕地向着奥布哈姆替我們的國藥繼續大爲宣傳一番。他說下面便是一些特效藥用以撩治各種疾病的：</p>
<p>背痛須用鹿羅，以正在跑下山來而被射死的鹿爲最上品，它的尾巴才最名貴。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Chairman Receives Ambassador Stuart, Exchanges Views on the Attack on American Soldiers, Refrains from Drawing Conclusions Before the Truth is Clear <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>(Our newspaper's Kuling dispatch, 1st) Ambassador Stuart, just recovered from his illness, took a walk in the garden this morning. He was able to eat a little for breakfast and lunch. After a short nap at noon, his spirits improved. He then went to see the Chairman at 5 p.m. with Chuan Jingbo, advisor to the American Embassy. The conversation ended at 6:15 p.m. The Chairman was very pleased to see the Ambassador's recovery and expressed his concern and care for the Ambassador's convalescence. He repeatedly urged, "As an old friend, I hope you will rest and recuperate in the mountains for a few days." The Ambassador, deeply touched by the Chairman's kindness, agreed to stay in Kuling for a few days, but still hopes to return to Nanjing before next Wednesday.</p>
<p>(Central News Agency, Kuling, 1st) Ambassador Leighton Stuart paid a visit to Chairman Chiang at 5 p.m. on the 1st, and the meeting lasted for one hour and fifteen minutes, ending at 6:15 p.m. Forty-five minutes of the meeting were devoted to exchanging views on the attack on the U.S. Marine Corps on the Pingjin Highway, as both the Chairman and the Ambassador had received a great deal of relevant reports and information from the Peiping Executive Headquarters and the U.S. Embassy in Nanjing. Other issues were not discussed. However, the Chairman expressed deep concern for the Ambassador's recent recovery from illness, saying to the Ambassador, "I am not speaking as the head of China, but as a longtime friend, urging you not to leave Kuling until your health is fully restored." The Ambassador, unable to refuse the Chairman's kindness, will rest in Kuling for at least two or three more days. According to Jingbo, the Ambassador's personal advisor, who also accompanied the Ambassador during his visit to the Chairman today, both the Chairman and the Ambassador considered the attack on the U.S. Marine Corps on the Pingjin Highway to be unfortunate and expressed great concern. Before the facts are ascertained, they are unwilling to draw conclusions hastily. If the incident was a premeditated ambush or a planned act, it must be regarded as serious. Marshall's sudden departure from Kuling a few days ago was related to this incident. When reporters inquired about the exact number of American Marine Corps casualties, Chuan said it was difficult to say, only knowing that a lieutenant-level officer fluent in Chinese stepped forward during the attack and asked the other side to stop shooting, but was unfortunately shot and killed.</p>
<p>(Our newspaper's Peiping dispatch, 1st) The Communist Party's explanation for the Xianghe incident is that on the morning of the 29th, the Eighth Route Army's defense area near Anping Town, Xianghe, was suddenly attacked by troops of unknown origin, followed by the participation of more than 60 American soldiers. Both sides suffered casualties in the battle. In the afternoon, American reinforcements arrived, and the Communist army withdrew on its own.</p>
<h3 id="e2">Communist Army Admits to Attacking American Soldiers, Peiping Executive Headquarters Conducts Thorough Investigation, Government Demands Surrender of Perpetrators <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>(Our newspaper's Peiping dispatch, 1st) After Chairman Chiang's telegram ordering Li Zongren, Director of the Peiping Executive Headquarters, to strictly investigate the attack on American soldiers on the Pingjin Highway arrived, Li summoned Sun Lianzhong, Commander, and Zheng Jiemin, Committee Member of the Military Mediation Department, on the afternoon of the 1st to discuss solutions. After Commander Sun left, the reporter visited Director Li for an interview. In addition to Commander Sun sending his Deputy Chief of Staff, Feng Songyuan, to lead Huang Rencai, Commissioner of the Fifth District of Hebei, to conduct a thorough investigation at the site of the conflict in the Da Xiao Shahe area of Xianghe County, it was also decided to negotiate with the Communist side through the Military Mediation Department regarding responsibility. Furthermore, to prevent similar unfortunate incidents from happening again, sufficient troops will be deployed along the Pingjin Highway to protect it. In addition, Sun Lianzhong specially sent his Chief of Staff, Song Kentang, to the American military hospital on the morning of the 1st to express condolences to the wounded American officers and soldiers.</p>
<p>(Our newspaper's Peiping dispatch, 1st) In the conflict in Xianghe where the Communist army attacked American soldiers, a Communist army doctor was injured and captured by the American army. The Communist Party has admitted that they were involved. Regarding whether the 25th investigation team sent by the Military Mediation Department has already departed, both the government and Communist Party sides in the Military Mediation Department were evasive. According to high-ranking officials on the government side, this unfortunate incident involves diplomatic issues, and the government attaches great importance to it. It will demand that the Communist Party hand over the perpetrators. The government also intends to provide compensation for the dead and wounded, but it is not yet known whether the American army will accept it. Zheng Gongmin, Committee Member of the Military Mediation Department, sent personnel yesterday to deliver fruit to the wounded American soldiers as a token of sympathy, and Li Zongren will also send personnel to express condolences in the coming days.</p>
<p>(Our newspaper's Peiping dispatch, 1st) The Xianghe County area of the Pingjin Highway has always been a Communist army guerrilla zone. Before the conflict in which American soldiers were attacked, only merchants traveled on the highway. National army or government vehicles had never used it. The American army's trip was the first time, and the unfortunate incident occurred immediately. In the future, after the National army deploys along the highway, the highway may be passable without obstruction.</p>
<p>(Our newspaper's Kuling dispatch, 1st) In view of the recent attack on American soldiers on the Pingjin Highway, the authorities believe that it is necessary to immediately strengthen the security of railways and highways in North China to ensure the safety of transportation. According to news from North China, it is possible that the entire Pingjin and Jinpu railway lines will be opened to traffic in the short term.</p>
<p>(Central News Agency, Peiping, 1st) Regarding the attack on American soldiers on the Pingjin Highway, it is reported that the Chinese Communist side has admitted that it was committed by the Communist army. The Military Mediation Department intends to send a special team to investigate. The Communist side has no objection, but the American side insists that the team should depart to investigate after the Marine Corps' report and information are compiled.</p>
<p>(United Press, Tianjin, 1st) The U.S. Marine Corps motorized patrol has been greatly strengthened since the ambush on Monday. The patrol now carries tanks, rocket launchers, etc. It is said that the patrol will continue to patrol once every three days as before, but yesterday's patrol was an exception. Several incidents occurred two or three days ago, when the U.S. Marine Corps stationed at the Tianjin East Arsenal was shot at several times, and one soldier was injured. It is reported that the shooter ordered civilians to use as cover. The rumor that the U.S. Marine Corps will withdraw from the arsenal is not true.</p>

<p>(Our newspaper's Nanjing dispatch, 1st) According to military sources: Xu Yongchang and Zhou Enlai, representing the Nationalists and Communists respectively in the Military Affairs Sub-Committee, exchanged memoranda today. The Communist side submitted Memorandum No. 110, and the government side submitted Nanjing Document No. 9595. The content is unknown, but it may be related to the war situation.</p>

<p>(Our newspaper's Peiping dispatch, 1st) Regarding the agreement obtained by the Military Mediation 9th Team in Laohekou, as reported by yesterday's telegram, the specific points of the agreement are as follows: (1) Li Xiannian's Communist army will cease moving, and the National army will cease pursuing. (2) The team will designate "suitable areas for stationing" for the troops after contacting Li Xiannian's representatives. (3) The government troops will retreat ten miles west from the conflict line, and the Communist troops will retreat ten miles east. (4) Regarding the concentration of scattered units of Li Xiannian's troops, the team will designate a concentration point, and the National army will allow the Communist army to pass through the defense area to the designated concentration point. (5) Request the 32nd Team to assist in providing food and accommodating wounded soldiers to both the National and Communist armies. It is reported that the main force of Li Xiannian's troops is currently in the Shangnan area of Shaanxi. The 9th Team is still working hard to contact the troops.</p>

<p>(Central News Agency, this city dispatch) It has been rumored that Chen Lifu, Minister of the Central Organization Department, will visit Lushan in the coming days. Upon hearing the news, the reporter immediately went to his residence to pay a visit. Chen received the reporter. The reporter asked, "I heard that the Minister is going to Lushan soon. I wonder if there is any important mission?" Chen replied, "I am indeed going to Lushan because the Lushan Summer Camp has invited me to give a lecture." The reporter, referring to the Reuters Nanjing dispatch of July 30, which reported Zhou Enlai's first public statement after meeting with Marshal Marshall and Ambassador Stuart, in which he said: "The Communist Party's proposals do not go beyond the scope of the Political Consultative Conference resolutions, so if the government can accept them, it will not be difficult to establish peace. The main obstacle lies in the elements within the Kuomintang who want to resolve the issue by force, as evidenced by Chen Lifu's recent remarks," asked the Minister for his opinion on this. Chen replied, "I am one of the first and have always been in favor of and will implement a political solution to the Kuomintang-Communist issue. I have briefly mentioned this in my previous remarks. Zhou and I know the details of this matter best, and he should not be so forgetful. If Zhou has no intention of overturning his previous advocacy of peace and unity, then why would he slander and attack someone like me who has always advocated and has implemented a political solution? Therefore, I hope that Zhou's remarks are only his consistent propaganda technique of 'blaming others' and do not want to draw deeper inferences. The prerequisite for peace and democracy depends on the restoration of transportation and the nationalization of the army. If these two cannot be achieved, the situation of armed separatism will always exist, and the threats to peace and obstacles to democracy cannot be removed. If you try to compare the efforts made by the government and the Communist Party on these two matters, you can know who is seriously implementing the Political Consultative Conference resolutions and who is wantonly destroying them. The facts are there, and they have been widely heard and seen at home and abroad. There is no need to argue with words." The reporter further asked whether the Minister knew that Zhou had recently indicated that he would not consider answering the Minister's letter of inquiry. Chen said with a solemn expression, "It is regrettable that a responsible person of a political party does not have a responsible attitude towards his defamatory remarks against others. However, I also deeply understand that Zhou has no way to take responsibility for his own remarks in recent years." The reporter, seeing that Minister Chen had many visitors waiting to be received, excused himself and left. Upon shaking hands in farewell, the reporter asked one last question, "Then will the Minister take the next step on this matter?" Chen waved his folding fan and smiled, quoting Mencius, "If someone treats me with rudeness, then a gentleman must reflect on himself... If, upon reflection, he is loyal, if, upon reflection, he is polite, and the rudeness remains, then the gentleman says, 'This is also a foolish person.' In that case, what choice is there..."</p>

<p>Plan Submitted to Executive Yuan</p>
<p>(Our newspaper's Nanjing dispatch, 1st) Regarding the addition of a landline to the Beijing-Shanghai long-distance telephone, the Ministry of Communications has recently submitted the plan to the Executive Yuan for approval. If it can be approved and foreign exchange is obtained, the equipment will not be a problem and it can be completed within one year. Currently, only ten long-distance telephone lines between Beijing and Shanghai can be used simultaneously. If the entire plan is completed, the first step will be to have at least thirty lines that can be used simultaneously, and the second step can reach two hundred lines, greatly facilitating telephone calls for users in Beijing and Shanghai.</p>
<h3 id="e12">Invited by Chairman Chiang and His Wife, Admiral Cooke Arrives in Kuling, Visited Marshall in Beijing and Had a Long Conversation <a href="#e12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>
<p>(Our newspaper's Kuling dispatch, 1st) Admiral Cooke, Commander-in-Chief of the U.S. Fleet in China, arrived in Lushan at 6 p.m. on the 1st with his wife, a son, and a daughter, at the invitation of Chairman Chiang and his wife. However, Admiral Cooke only intends to stay for two days and then return to Beijing with his family. When reporters inquired about the attack on American soldiers, Admiral Cooke declined to comment.</p>
<p>(Central News Agency, Kuling, 1st) Mrs. Marshall hosted a banquet for Chairman Chiang and his wife, and Admiral Cooke and his wife, at 40 Hexi Road at 8 p.m. on the 1st.</p>
<p>(Our newspaper's Nanjing dispatch, 1st) Admiral Cooke, Commander-in-Chief of the U.S. Fleet in China, flew from Shanghai to Beijing this morning, arriving at 10:20 a.m. After a short rest at the naval residence on Beiping Road, he went directly to 5 Ninghai Road to visit Marshal Marshall, accompanied by Navy Attaché Colonel Conan. Cooke and Marshall had a very long conversation and had lunch together. Admiral Cooke then took a special plane to Jiujiang and Kuling at about 1 p.m. Marshal Marshall also went to the U.S. military reception center on Xikang Road at 7:30 p.m. tonight. It is reported that Marshall's return to Beijing this time is mainly to take care of matters related to the U.S. military stationed in China, so he had meetings with U.S. military officials in Beijing. The content is unknown.</p>
<h3 id="e13">Marshall Met with Zhou Enlai Yesterday, Inquired about the Attack on the U.S. Marine Corps, Scheduled to Leave Beijing for Kuling This Weekend <a href="#e13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>(Our newspaper's Nanjing dispatch, 1st) In the atmosphere of the stalemate, Marshall finally invited Zhou Enlai to meet at 4 p.m. today, giving those concerned about the situation a glimmer of hope. According to the Communist Party delegation, Zhou visited Marshall this afternoon as scheduled for nearly three hours. The main topic of the conversation was Marshall's inquiry about the attack on the U.S. military by the Communist army in Anping, eastern Hebei, because Marshall had received a report from the U.S. Marine Corps stationed in Tianjin. Zhou said that this was an unfortunate incident and not a predetermined policy. If this happened, it was due to a misunderstanding. Zhou has now telegraphed Yan'an to conduct an investigation. If it was committed by the Communist army, they should be responsible. Secondly, he reported that he had been in Kuling for several days and had not had many meetings due to Ambassador Stuart's illness. There was no new development in the negotiations. The conversation lasted for three hours.</p>
<p>(Our newspaper's Nanjing dispatch, 1st) Regarding the attack on the U.S. Marine Corps in the Anping area on the Pingjin Highway, the Xinhua News Agency in Yan'an claimed that it was the U.S. military attacking the Anping Liberated Area, including the sentence "seriously protesting the illegal act of armed interference in China's internal affairs against the United States." However, when Zhou Enlai met with Marshall, it was reported that Marshall told him that he had received a report, and Zhou said that he would "wait for investigation." We still remember that Zhou has repeatedly stated recently that he demanded the withdrawal of the U.S. military stationed in China, and in a certain meeting between Zhou and Ambassador Stuart, he clearly stated that U.S. aid to China was fueling the Chinese civil war. It can be seen that the Communist Party's anti-American attitude has now become superficial. It is heard that Marshall made a verbal protest to the Communist Party delegation, but the spokesman of the Communist Party delegation denied it.</p>
<p>(Our newspaper's Nanjing dispatch, 1st) Marshall is scheduled to go to Kuling this Saturday to spend the weekend with nature. It is not yet known whether he will meet with Zhou Enlai again on the 2nd. However, judging from the current situation, the topic of conversation seems to have moved from the stage of political negotiations between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party to the "Anping Incident."</p>
<p>(United Press, Nanjing, 1st) After returning to Beijing from Kuling, Special Envoy Marshall met with Zhou Enlai for the first time today for a sincere and long conversation. All parties are speculating that Marshall is now making renewed efforts to promote a coalition government to resolve China's difficulties. Most observers believe that China's military situation has completely lost control, and only the realization of a coalition government can remedy it. The Communist Party has raised objections to some points of the coalition government, such as the number of seats in the National Government Committee and the distribution of ministers in the Executive Yuan. However, if the Communists continue to argue, they may not gain anything, so they may tacitly approve the organization of the new government, unless such drastic steps are taken quickly, otherwise the future of the overall situation is bleak.</p>

<p>(Central News Agency, Nanjing, 1st) Sir Stevenson, the newly appointed British Ambassador to China, and his wife arrived at Zhongshan Wharf in Xiaguan at 10 a.m. on the 1st aboard the destroyer HMS Consort. Li Jun, Director of the Protocol Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Minister Jia, Australian Minister Kobran, British Prime Minister's Representative General Wyatt, and many staff members of the British Embassy were at the wharf to greet them. The Ambassador is scheduled to pay a courtesy call to Vice Minister Gan Naiguang, Acting Minister of Foreign Affairs, at 10 a.m. tomorrow and is scheduled to go to Lushan to present his credentials.</p>
<p>At 11:30 a.m. today, Stevenson received reporters at the Ambassador's residence, saying that one of Britain's aspirations in China is to rebuild Sino-British trade and, if possible, strengthen it. For this reason, Britain hopes for unity and stability within China, because unity and stability are the basis of prosperity. Referring to the conclusion of a new Sino-British commercial treaty, the Ambassador believed that a new treaty was necessary due to general changes in the situation. It is said that according to the new Sino-British Treaty of 1945, the Sino-British commercial treaty was to be signed within six months after the end of the war. It happened that the Chinese government returned to Nanjing after the end of the war, which delayed it. It is believed that both China and the United Kingdom will begin negotiations soon. The Ambassador also said that the British people greatly admired the Chinese people's hard resistance for eight years under the leadership of their heroic leader. After the war, the British people universally economized and responded to the relief and rehabilitation work of the United Nations. One percent of the total national income has been donated to the United Nations, which can help countries in more difficult situations. As for its policy towards China, the British government has adopted the same policy as the United States, and the United Kingdom also supports the "open door" policy for trade with China.</p>

<h3 id="e16">Postal and Telegraph Losses Too Great; Ministry of Communications Considers Price Increase <a href="#e16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>The Plan Has Been Submitted to the Executive Yuan for Approval</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 1st Dispatch] According to a spokesperson from the Ministry of Communications, the postal and telegraph services are currently facing a significant difficulty. The monthly income barely covers employee salaries and expenses. The postal service is losing 4 billion yuan each month, and the telegraph service is losing 5.7 billion yuan. While the national treasury is trying to make up the difference, it is impossible to pay for engineering expenses and new equipment. Furthermore, due to the large discrepancy between income and expenses, it has become necessary to delay employee salaries, leading to instability among employees and making improvements in work difficult. Therefore, the Ministry of Communications has recently proposed a price increase, which has been submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval. The price increase will be more than double the current prices but can only be implemented after it is approved by the Executive Yuan. In the meantime, we hope that the public will provide opinions on the price increase.</p>

<h3 id="e19">Qin Decun Returns to Shanghai after "Big Problem"; Shares Feelings About Japan Trip With Reporters; Says Responsibility for Aggression Does Not Lie With the People <a href="#e19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>[Our City News] Qin Decun, Deputy Minister of National Defense, who was invited by the Far East International Military Tribunal to testify during the trial of Japanese war criminals Doihara and Matsui, has completed his mission in the north. He returned to the country by Air Force Eighth Group B-24 bomber from Tokyo at 10:20 AM yesterday and arrived in Shanghai at 4:40 PM. He landed at Dajiao Airport. Those who went to the airport to welcome him included Major General Zou Renzhi, Director of the Department of Prisoner Management of the Ministry of National Defense, and Yao Gengsheng, Director of the Shanghai Liaison Office of the Chinese Delegation to Japan. Mr. Qin looked rested and full of spirit. After getting off the plane and exchanging greetings with the welcomers, reporters approached him to inquire about his feelings on attending the international tribunal in Japan.</p>
<p>The Situation of the Far East Tribunal's Trial</p>
<p>He said: "The public trial of the Tokyo International Military Tribunal, like the Nuremberg Tribunal, is a manifestation of mankind's highest wisdom in seeking to prevent war from recurring. This kind of trial can have a far-reaching impact on world peace and security. When questioning important Japanese war criminals, diplomats and politicians from allied countries familiar with the war crimes were often invited to testify. Because I had personally witnessed the Lugou Bridge Incident and other atrocities committed by the Japanese, I was also one of the witnesses. The trial adopted a majority rule system. For each war criminal, while preventing them from escaping justice, they were still allowed to present sufficient evidence in rebuttal to make a favorable defense."</p>
<p>The Japanese People Are Mostly Pure and Kind</p>
<p>Regarding the responsibility of war criminals, Qin said: "During my trip to Japan, I traveled to Kyoto, Nara, Osaka, Kobe, Nagoya, Yokohama, and other places, and I deeply felt that the majority of the Japanese people are pure and kind in their thoughts. Therefore, I believe that the responsibility for launching the aggression does not lie with the Japanese people, nor with the soldiers who were conscripted into the army (excluding individuals who committed atrocities during the war), but rather with the few militarists who initiated the aggression. For example, the Japanese conspiracy to invade China was actually orchestrated by Doihara, and the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere was advocated solely by Matsui. The responsibility is very clear."</p>
<h3 id="e20">Chen Ce Fitted with British Artificial Leg; Walks Without Cane <a href="#e20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 1st Dispatch] The artificial leg that the British government presented to General Chen Ce was delivered by Major Watson, dispatched by the Hong Kong government, and was personally fitted for Mr. Chen at the Naval Association. After being fitted with the leg, Mr. Chen was able to walk without a cane, and his steps were almost indistinguishable from those with a real leg.</p>
<p>Four Major Areas of War Criminal Trials</p>
<p>When asked when the Far East International Tribunal would end, he said: "The trials of Japanese war criminals are divided into four major areas: the Northeast Incident, the North China Incident, the atrocities of massacres, and economic aggression. Recently, the trial of the 'Nanjing Massacre' case is underway, and it is expected to be completed by the end of the year. The verification procedures and trial process are quite complex and require a long time to handle." Regarding whether the Japanese Emperor would also be listed as a war criminal, Qin explained that as of now, the International Military Tribunal has not made this decision, but representatives from two of the eleven countries' judges have made this proposal.</p>
<p>Shibuya Incident Vented Hatred</p>
<p>At this point, the reporter raised the issue of the tragic killing of Taiwanese compatriots by Japanese people in the Shibuya Valley incident, inquiring about his views on behalf of the public. Qin said: "The details have already been recorded at the [Taiwan] Representative Office. I believe that the occurrence of this tragedy was due to the fact that Taiwanese compatriots had been subjected to 50 years of hateful rule by the Japanese in the past, and they inevitably took this opportunity to vent their feelings. However, the Japanese police cannot escape responsibility for excessively using their defensive powers. After the tragedy occurred, our delegation to Japan reported the details to General MacArthur's headquarters and repeatedly negotiated with the Japanese side. The Japanese government paid great attention to this matter and sent personnel to express to our delegation that they would replace the police chief. Recently, during a meeting of the State Council, the committee members expressed their admiration for Chairman Chiang's attitude of 'repaying evil with virtue' and unanimously passed a resolution to thank the Chinese government. All of this shows that the Japanese government is quite apologetic about the Shibuya incident." Mr. Qin is scheduled to take the night train to Nanjing tonight. Whether he will go to the Northeast will depend on the needs of the situation in Guangdong and Rehe.</p>
<h3 id="e21">Two Major Aggressors Against China; Isoya and Tani Are Escorted to Shanghai; Detained at the Jiangwan Gaojing Temple Detention Center <a href="#e21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>[Our City News] Isoya Renriki and Tani Hisao, two Japanese war criminals who strongly advocated aggression against China, were arrested by General MacArthur's headquarters in Japan this spring after our country proposed them as war criminals. The Ministry of National Defense then telegraphed the delegation in Japan to inform the U.S. side to hand them over to China for trial. These two criminals were escorted from Sugamo Prison in Tokyo by Chang Jiakai, a member of our delegation in Japan, and other personnel, and flown to Shanghai on a special plane. They arrived at Dajiao Airport at around 6:00 PM yesterday (the 1st). Major General Zou Renzhi, Director of the War Criminals Management Office of the Ministry of National Defense, specially dispatched Xu Yisan, the chief of the group, and four soldiers to escort them to the Jiangwan Gaojing Temple General Detention Center. This is the first time our country has extradited war criminals from Japan for trial. It is said that the Ministry of National Defense also intends to extradite other war criminals to China for public trial and sentence them to the crimes they deserve.</p>
<p>Tall and Short</p>
<p>After the plane carrying the two criminals landed at Dajiao Airport, the two criminals appeared in the window of the aircraft, and our personnel in charge of escorting them stood guard on the side. Isoya was burly with thick eyebrows, while Tani was short, wearing a hat, with a small head and hunched back. The difference in their height made for an amusing sight. The two criminals were wearing green spring military uniforms and black leather shoes. They even waved their hats in greeting after getting off the plane, apparently unaware that those at the airport were all there to escort them to China. Their luggage consisted of three bundles and a small leather suitcase. Tani spoke fluent English and answered reporters' questions in English. The index cards in his small leather suitcase were also all in English. According to the two criminals, they had been interrogated by the British several times since being detained this spring. They were taken from prison and put on the plane yesterday afternoon, not knowing where they were flying to. They only found out it was Shanghai when they arrived at the airport. The two criminals were then taken by special car led by Xu Yisan, chief of the group, and the soldiers to the Gaojing Temple War Criminals General Detention Center in Jiangwan, where Director Yao Kaibai and Deputy Director Jiang Wenhe, among others, inquired about them before detaining them. Whether the two criminals will be transferred to the Shanghai Military Tribunal or sent back to Nanjing for trial is currently under consideration.</p>
<p>Crimes of the Two</p>
<p>Isoya Renriki, 64, is a well-known China expert in the Japanese army and a strong advocate of aggression against China. He issued a secret booklet called "Observations on China," strongly advocating the use of force to invade China. He was arrested by the U.S. military stationed in Japan on February 3 this year. Tani Hisao is the protagonist of the Nanjing Massacre and the number one criminal in the attack on Nanjing. He is 65 years old this year. When Tani first came to China, he was the Chief of Staff of the 3rd Division of Nagoya and launched the Jinan Massacre. He was stationed in China for ten months. After the July 7th Incident, he served as the Lieutenant General Commander of the 6th Division of Kumamoto and led his troops to station in North China. After August 13th, he landed in Hangzhou and advanced on Nanjing. When Nanjing fell, he was the first to occupy the city and ordered his troops to massacre, resulting in the unprecedented Nanjing Massacre. After staying in Nanjing for three days, he attacked Wuhu. Later, he was transferred back to Japan and served as the commander of the Hiroshima district. He was arrested by the U.S. military on January 17 this year and imprisoned with Isoya in Sugamo Prison.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 1st Dispatch] Last night, reporters went to Sun Zhongyuan's residence and were received by a Ma Shanyun. Mr. Ma explained the "misunderstanding" surrounding Sun Zhongyuan's disappearance as follows: on the afternoon of July 18, Sun was strolling near Nanchizi with his wife's younger sister, Wang Lizhen, and his daughter, Lequn, when he ran into Bao Shilai, an old friend of ten years. Overjoyed at their reunion, they warmly exchanged greetings. Wang Lizhen and Lequn, not seeing them, proceeded ahead and became separated from Sun. That evening, Sun was invited by Bao to his private residence in Shifangyuan and, after a long conversation, his old brain ailment recurred, so he temporarily stayed at Bao's residence to recuperate. Sun has now recovered from his illness but has also received two anonymous letters. For his personal safety, Sun sent a letter to Director Li of the General Headquarters, requesting protection. Later Sun himself appeared, of medium height and quite robust, but seemingly fatigued, with a limp and using his hand to support his head, saying his brain ailment had not healed and his leg was also numb. He also said: "I didn't get lost, it's a misunderstanding." Having secured travel expenses, he will return to Chengdu. Sun, along with his wife's younger sister Wang Lizhen and daughter Lequn, left Beiping by plane this morning. Via Xi'an they will return to Chengdu. Sun has also officially withdrawn from the Democratic League and will soon publish a letter to that effect.</p>

<h3 id="e25">Communists Plan to Issue Bonds; Reform Current "Land Policy"; Zhang Dongsun Says Democratic League Is Not Acting as Tail of the Communist Party <a href="#e25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 31st Dispatch] Zhang Dongsun said today that people close to the Communist Party have revealed that the Communist Party Central Committee is studying the issuance of bonds to reform the Communist Party's current land policy. According to this policy, after removing the land that landlords should retain for their own cultivation, they will be forced to sell their other land by purchasing bonds. This land will then be distributed to the proletariat. As for the amount of land each person should retain and the interest rate on the bonds, nothing has been heard. Zhang also said that the Democratic League is not acting as the tail of the Communist Party and that some fundamental differences exist. He opposes the Communist Party's current land policy, and especially opposes using the temporary impulses of the "struggle" and "liquidation" of the masses as the basis for various decisions. He believes this is lawless.</p>
<h3 id="e26">Local Dispatches; Commander of Communist Army in Hebei, Shandong, and Henan Provinces Convened Secret Party Committee Meeting <a href="#e26" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c26" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">26</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Xuzhou Dispatch] Liu Bocheng, Commander of the Communist Army in the Hebei, Shandong, and Henan military region, recently convened a secret meeting of the party committees of each county in the third military sub-district, at which the following was decided: (1) Use the militia to control territory and use all the forces of the third military sub-district to support the current situation. (2) If the National Army in Xuzhou is coerced and launches a counterattack against the "liberated areas," the Communist Army should immediately eliminate the "stubborn" forces in the controlled areas. If the main force cannot hold, prepare to retreat using a scorched earth policy. (3) The third military sub-district and the Southern Shandong "liberated area" should be defended at all costs. If it is impossible to support them, then try to detour to the rear of the National Army from the western section of the Longhai Railway to disrupt them and destroy transportation. (4) If deemed necessary, use part of the main force of the third military sub-district to attack Jieshan and Huangkou and destroy railway bridges.</p>
<p>Jiaxing - Please Exempt Field Tax and Reduce Actual Borrowing</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of exempting field tax and reducing actual borrowing in the Jiaxing area, the Zhejiang Provincial Fellow-Countrymen Association in Shanghai held a joint meeting and appointed Gu Suming and other representatives to go to the provincial capital to petition. The main points are: (1) In the past, the Zhejiang military used discounted currency. It is hoped that the government will continue to handle it according to the principle of Zhejiang West discounted currency. (2) Please exempt the borrowing of 1.5 dou. As for the 3 dou of actual tax and the 30% public grain attached to the borrowing, please reduce it appropriately. (3) The actual tax amount in Zhejiang Province is 5.4 dou per yuan, while in Jiangsu, the actual tax amount is only 2.4 dou per yuan after being calculated at a 40% discount. The difference is too large, so please the government to average and reduce it. (4) The purpose of the petition is to change the tax to 3 dou per yuan of Zhejiang currency. After discussion, Chairman Shen agreed to investigate the matter of 2.4 dou of actual tax in Jiangsu Province. If the information is accurate, he will strive for it with the Ministry of Food. The other requests for exempting borrowing and reducing the amount of actual tax and discounted currency are all established central government policies and must be submitted to the central government for decision.</p>
<p>Huzhou - Bandit Forces Still Rampant in Wuxing</p>
<p>Although the Bandit Suppression Committee has been established for more than a month, the bandit forces are still rampant. In the village of Wutang outside Guomen, two bandit ships suddenly arrived late at night on the 27th. There were more than ten bandits on board, speaking a local dialect, carrying three wooden-cased guns and three long guns. They landed from the west and robbed houses one by one. Although there was a task force in the countryside, they did not dare to pursue them due to insufficient weapons, and only fired a few shots as a warning. The bandits then fled with a howl. In addition, the Hongli steamboat of this city was sailing from Shanghai to Huzhou on the same day when it was only eight miles away from Lake, and suddenly about twenty bandits appeared, equipped with machine guns and rifles, ordering the boat to stop. They jumped onto the boat and searched each passenger one by one. The total loss is estimated to be about 8 million yuan. After the bandits achieved their goal, they left with a flourish.</p>
<p>Hangzhou - Zhejiang Field Tax and Grain Collection Will Begin Soon</p>
<p>Zhejiang Province has decided to proceed with the collection of field tax and grain, which will begin in the second half of the year. It is stipulated that the collection will begin in Eastern Zhejiang on September 1 and in Western Zhejiang on September 5. The amount of grain to be collected is 3.6 million shi of market measure, the amount of grain to be borrowed is 1.8 million shi of market measure, and the amount of grain for provincial and county public use is 1.08 million shi of market measure. Chairman Chiang is very concerned about the collection of grain. Yesterday (the 30th), he telegraphed the Zhejiang Provincial Government from Guling, ordering the Provincial Government to explain and persuade the Provincial Assembly and social leaders that the collection of grain is necessary for the national economy and the people's livelihood and is a last resort measure, and that it must be collected this year and completed within the time limit without delay.</p>
<p>Taicang - Xihu Bus Robbed Again</p>
<p>Two Xihu highway passenger cars were robbed again on the morning of the 27th, from the Zhitang station to the vicinity of the Catholic Church. It is said that there were four bandits, two posing as passengers who boarded the car at Zhitang, and two waiting on the side of the highway at the Catholic Church. When the first car arrived there, the two bandits on the side of the road threatened the driver to stop with guns. They then jumped into the carriage, and the two bandits in the car also drew their guns, and robbed all the passengers of their gold jewelry, watches, cash, etc. When they tried to go to the car behind, the car happened to be carrying a certain adjutant from the Zhitang Self-Defense Force, who was equipped with quick and slow machine guns. Seeing that the car in front was being robbed, he fired a warning shot. The bandits did not have time to get on the car and fired back at the gun before escaping west. The losses of all the passengers are being investigated.</p>
<p>Hushuguan - Please Set Export Raw Silk Subsidy Price</p>

<h3 id="e27">Establishing a "People's Peace" <a href="#e27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>——Reflections on Foreign Minister Wang's Speech at the Paris Peace Conference——</p>
<p>The globally anticipated Paris Peace Conference convened as scheduled a few days ago. Our representative, Foreign Minister Wang Shijie, following [Pierre] Mendès France and British delegation leader Prime Minister Attlee, delivered a speech elaborating on the reconstruction of a lasting post-war peace and the policies embraced by our nation. The entire text is grounded in upholding promises and valuing justice, with particular attention to the potential impact on defeated nations in the creation of peace. It concludes that the creation of this peace should be a peace for ordinary people, not merely a peace for government representatives, unlike some past peace settlements. It truly reflects our nation's upright and peaceful approach and demonstrates the virtues of benevolence, love, trustworthiness, and righteousness cherished by our people. The adoption of this principle is a necessary condition for a lasting world peace. I respectfully offer these few words to express my sentiments.</p>
<p>Foreign Minister Wang's speech emphasized that the creation of a lasting peace should be a peace for ordinary people, not merely a peace for government representatives. This is a prerequisite for reconstructing a lasting peace, a point we must particularly emphasize. The Second World War was originally called a "People's War." After a "People's War," there must be a "People's Peace" to ensure lasting peace. What is a "People's Peace?" It means that the creation of a post-war peace should not only focus on the intentions of government representatives but should also be based on the aspirations of the people. Decisions should not be made in defiance of the people's wishes. It must ensure that the people's desires are satisfied for a lasting peace to be established. The proposal of this principle is rooted in painful historical experience. The peace created after the First World War was not lasting because it was not based on the aspirations of the people but was merely an expression of the personal will of a few leaders. Their own will could not gain the support of their own people, and the peace they created failed to grasp the intentions of the defeated nations' people. Therefore, the ink on the treaties was barely dry before they were torn up, and figures like Hitler ultimately rose to power. Looking back, we should emphasize establishing a "People's Peace" so that the peace created this time can truly be lasting.</p>
<p>In his speech to the representatives at the Peace Conference, Foreign Minister Wang specifically pointed out two points: (1) The victorious nations must strictly adhere to the promises they made during the war and the principles they put forward. For example, when referring to mediating conflicts over territorial claims, we must not forget the Atlantic Charter, nor should we restrict its implementation; (2) The victorious nations should not impose conditions on the defeated nations that would allow reactionary elements in the defeated nations to make a comeback while depriving democratic forces of any opportunity for rebirth or consolidation. The proposal of these two points is based on the premise that the peace created this time should be a "People's Peace." This is merely an explanation of how to create a "People's Peace," a method for creating a "People's Peace." The realization of the Atlantic Charter was the desire of ordinary people during the war. Now that the fighting has ceased, we should promote its realization to comfort the people's hopes. As for the victorious nations not imposing conditions on the defeated nations that would allow reactionary elements within the defeated nations to make a comeback and deprive democratic forces of any opportunity for rebirth or consolidation, this is something that China naturally feels particularly keenly about. China has been subjected to aggression by Japanese reactionary elements for the longest time. Therefore, China is especially unwilling to see the victorious nations propose any conditions that would allow reactionary elements in the defeated nations to make a comeback. Although the convocation of the Paris Peace Conference this time does not target Germany and Japan, the general principles for creating peace after the war must be established. Therefore, even without the participation of Germany and Japan, this principle should be widely adopted. All of this constitutes the fundamental conditions for establishing a "People's Peace."</p>
<p>However, when we think about the process of convening the Paris Peace Conference this time and the draft treaty proposals regarding Italy, Romania, Hungary, Finland, and Bulgaria, as revealed in the newspapers, we cannot help but feel concerned about the recreation of peace. The path to the so-called "People's Peace" is still distant. As Foreign Minister Wang said: "...I believe that each draft should be discussed more fully by the General Assembly, as the topics designed have a great impact on the future stability of Europe. Anyone who tries to read these draft treaties cannot deny that many of the agreements reached are based on mutual compromise. If we can find ways to improve them, it is not for the narrow interests of any concerned parties, but for the broad and universal interests." From this, we can see that the drafting of this treaty is closer to a "peace for government representatives" and seems to have a considerable distance from a "peace for ordinary people." Here, we also see Australian representative Evatt's speech at the Peace Conference, advocating that the great powers should not harbor a spirit of revenge and force their will on others. He said: "Our goal is the word 'justice.' Men, women, old and young, around the world all hope to obtain a peace that meets the principles of fairness for them and their descendants. If we impose on them the burden of injustice and excessive humiliation, then we will violate the democratic spirit, and fascism may return." What he said resonates with Foreign Minister Wang's speech, complementing each other. The central idea is also to establish a "People's Peace" so that peace can be lasting.</p>
<p>Although the purpose of this Paris Peace Conference is to create a local peace in Europe, it is of great significance to the future global and lasting peace. We hope that the representatives gathered at the Paris Peace Conference can learn from the failures of past peace creations and be vigilant, so that they can create a lasting peace for the world and for humanity—a "People's Peace." Only then can the world be spared the devastation of war.</p>

<h3 id="e28">All Twenty-One Nations to Participate in Paris Peace Conference Subcommittees; Rules Committee Passes Resolution Yesterday <a href="#e28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper] Paris, Day 1 Radio Broadcast: The Peace Conference Rules Committee met this morning. After intense debate, it passed a resolution allowing all 21 nations to participate in various subcommittees. The General Assembly will meet this afternoon to decide whether a two-thirds majority or just a simple majority is required for voting procedures.</p>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper] Paris, Day 1 Radio Broadcast: During today's meetings, the Soviet Union suddenly conceded, and Greece's proposal was accepted and passed unanimously. Any issue regarding the drafting of peace treaties, if proposed by one or more national delegations, can be included in the General Assembly's agenda. Molotov's concession allowed the procedural subcommittee to proceed smoothly, but a new problem arose due to a motion by the Netherlands. The Netherlands demanded that all 21 nations participating in the Peace Conference should not only be able to participate in the Steering Committee but also in all other committees. According to the original agreement of the Four Powers, only those who actually fought against a particular country could participate in the drafting committee for that country's peace treaty. Molotov then made another concession, proposing to allow all 21 nations to participate in all subcommittees, but only as observers without voting rights. He cited the US and France as examples, saying that when discussing the peace treaty with Finland, the US and France also participated but did not speak, as those two countries had not actually fought against Finland.</p>

<p>[Report from This Newspaper] Paris, Day 1 Radio Broadcast: The fourth plenary session of the Paris Peace Conference continued this afternoon at 4:00 PM, with representatives from the Netherlands, Yugoslavia, New Zealand, and Sweden delivering speeches. First, Yugoslavian representative Kardelj spoke, saying that Yugoslavia could not accept the Four Powers' compromise solution regarding the port of Trieste. Kardelj attacked the so-called "French Line" based on political, ethnic, and economic reasons. He said, "This line places a large number of our people under Italian rule and oppression and takes a large piece of Istria away from Yugoslavia. The so-called 'French Line' is a complete violation of all ethnic facts." The Dutch representative then spoke, stating that not only should defeated countries thoroughly reform and change course, but victorious countries, both large and small, should also refrain from terror, selfishness, and intolerance. He especially opposed the procedural restrictions on the participation of certain countries in certain committees. He said that all countries invited to participate in this Peace Conference should be allowed to participate in all aspects of the conference's work based on a status of absolute equality and rights. All systems that only benefit certain countries and harm the rights and interests of other countries will hinder the peaceful development of the international community.</p>
<p>[Reuters Paris, 31st Dispatch] Yesterday's General Assembly meeting lasted for three hours, adjourning at 7:00 PM. Towards the end of the meeting, representatives left one after another, and the VIP seats were almost empty. When the Brazilian representative spoke, there were only a few reporters in the press box.

<p>[Report from This Newspaper] San Francisco, Day 1 Radio Broadcast: According to senior Italian diplomats in Paris, under the economic terms of the Italian peace treaty, Italy will have to pay 666 billion lire in reparations. One diplomat said, "We fought alongside [the Allies] for twenty months, and it was all for nothing. When we carefully read the entire text of the treaty, we find it difficult to understand its true meaning and significance. If Italy had never fought against Germany, we don't know how much more severe the treaty would have been."</p>

<p>[Agence France-Presse Paris, Day 1 Dispatch] The Paris Opera House held a grand performance last night to entertain the representatives of various countries at the Peace Conference. As the representatives entered, they were greeted with diligent service by charming dancers. Two lines of guards in bright uniforms stood on the escalators. The representatives and their families sat in the boxes, while senior military officers, ambassadors, and diplomats sat in the main hall. US Secretary of State Byrnes and his family sat near the center. The box occupied by French President [Vincent] Auriol and his wife was three boxes away from Byrnes. Soviet representative Molotov sat behind his beloved daughter. Molotov's box was closer to the stage. The international celebrity [Alberto] Lleras Camargo, Director-General of the Pan American Union, arrived here yesterday afternoon and also attended the performance that evening. The singing and beards reached a high point.</p>

<p>[Report from This Newspaper] Paris Radio Broadcast: Prime Minister Attlee flew back to London today to attend an emergency cabinet meeting to discuss reports that President Truman had expressed "dissatisfaction" with the plan for Palestine.

<p>[Reuters London, 31st Dispatch] A New York Times reporter said that Foreign Secretary Bevin's inability to attend the Peace Conference due to illness has greatly diminished the conference. It is still uncertain whether Bevin will be able to travel to Paris within the week or next week. There is a general feeling that Attlee is more quiet and reserved, and it is difficult to predict whether he will be able to cope with Molotov's barrage strategy at the conference. If the straightforward and outspoken Bevin were present, Molotov would have difficulty applying his techniques. Based on past experience, dealing with the Soviet Union requires a strong and uncompromising personality. Only Bevin possesses this, and Attlee is admittedly inferior.</p>

<p>[Report from This Newspaper] San Francisco, Day 1 Weary Broadcast: UN Secretary-General Lie, in his report on the work of the United Nations, sternly warned the world that the work of the UN agencies cannot meet our expectations, and emphasized that the veto power obliges the five major powers to reach agreements themselves, but this obligation has not yet been fulfilled. Lie said, "For example, the issue of atomic energy control is a choice between life and death. The failure of the United Nations is the failure of peace and the victory of evil." Lie pointed out that various problems have arisen in the General Assembly due to the inability of countries to reach coordination. He said, "It is absolutely necessary for the major powers to seek coordination in a spirit of mutual understanding and compromise. If I do not point this out when submitting this report, I am afraid it will be difficult to avoid the blame for neglecting the security of the world."</p>
<h3 id="e36">Urging Decisive Action to Eliminate Fascist Remnants; Molotov's Speech Targets Franco <a href="#e36" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c36" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">36</a></h3>
<p>[Associated Press Paris, 31st Dispatch] Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov today urged the Peace Conference to take decisive action against the Franco government in Spain, advocating a call to all freedom-loving nations around the world to declare war on fascism. Molotov said in his speech that if we still have to deal with the Spanish fascist regime, then the democratic countries' assistance to the Spanish people oppressed by the Franco government and the elimination of the legacy of Hitler and Mussolini, which endangers peace, will not be far off. In any case, the interests of all freedom-loving nations require us to end the war against fascism, which is the most dangerous aggressor of modern times. Molotov continued, the decisions of the Council of Foreign Ministers have been attacked by various reactionary elements, a point that should not be ignored. These reactionary elements are filled with absurd anti-Soviet prejudices, and all their estimates are based on the failure of cooperation between the major powers. Molotov also responded to the opening remarks of French Foreign Minister [Georges] Bidault, saying that we are only requiring the enemy countries that fought alongside Germany to compensate for a portion of the damage they caused. The Soviet Union also opposes any external interference that hinders their economic recovery. Molotov acknowledged the Soviet Union's sympathy for the satellite states of the Axis powers, but said that they cannot be allowed to go unpunished. Molotov allowed the opinions taken from the satellite countries, saying that these countries joined the fight against Hitler in the end, proving their identity, and the Soviet Union has also established friendly relations with them. Australian representative Evatt then spoke (speech reported in yesterday's newspaper). Finally, Brazilian representative [João] Neves de Fontoura spoke, advocating the establishment of a peace aimed at morally disarming the world and not based solely on hatred and revenge. Brazil's ambition is only to cooperate with other countries to establish a reasonable peace.</p>
<h3 id="e37">Partition of Palestine; British Government Announces New Plan; Rumors of Truman's Dissatisfaction <a href="#e37" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c37" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">37</a></h3>
<p>[Reuters London, 31st Dispatch] Lord President of the Council Morrison announced in the House of Commons today the report of the joint Anglo-American Committee of Inquiry on the Palestine problem. The main points include dividing Palestine into four regions, establishing a central government, allowing 100,000 Jews to immediately immigrate to Palestine, the US providing financial assistance for the transfer of European Jewish refugees to Palestine, and the US providing loans to the Palestinian government specifically for improving the social and economic life of the Arabs in the area. Morrison further revealed that Britain had notified Washington that it intends to use these proposals as the basis for negotiations. Britain will convene a conference of both Jewish and Arab groups, hoping that they will accept the basis of the partition plan. Morrison concluded by saying that the implementation of this plan depends on the cooperation of the United States, otherwise Britain will have to reconsider the overall situation. The main points of the proposals put forward this time are as follows: A central government should be established in Palestine, with two provinces and two districts under it. The two provinces are the Jewish Province and the Arab Province, with individual legislative and administrative institutions. The Jewish Province includes areas where Jews are concentrated. The remaining areas, except for the Jerusalem and Negev districts, are all part of the Arab Province. The Jerusalem district includes the Holy City, Bethlehem, and neighboring areas. The provincial boundaries only refer to administrative jurisdiction and do not involve defense, tariffs, or transportation, which are the responsibilities of the central government. Each province should elect a provincial council, from which the High Commissioner selects the governor and the heads of various departments. The High Commissioner, with the assistance of the Council, exercises the powers of the central government and retains emergency powers. The Jerusalem district should establish a municipal council, with most of its members elected and the rest appointed by the High Commissioner.</p>
<p>[Associated Press Washington, 31st Dispatch] It is widely rumored here that President Truman has expressed dissatisfaction with the British-approved plan for the partition of Palestine.</p>

<p>[Agence France-Presse Washington, 31st Dispatch] According to reliable sources, France has asked the United States to intervene in the Vietnamese-Siamese border dispute and prevent Siam from submitting the dispute to the UN Security Council, instead requesting arbitration from the International Court of Justice in The Hague. According to well-informed sources, President Truman has approved the French request. The request will soon be submitted to the Siamese government through US mediation. If the dispute is submitted to the International Court of Justice, France will no longer oppose Siam's accession to the UN and will be willing to end the state of war that still exists between France and Siam. While the International Court of Justice is reviewing this issue, the disputed territory will be temporarily administered by the United States. On the other hand, if France's request is supported by the United States, Siam will express its compliance.</p>

<p>[Associated Press New York, 31st Dispatch] The Second Subcommittee of the UN Atomic Energy Commission is scheduled to hold a secret meeting at 7:00 PM today (Eastern Standard Time) to re-discuss the Soviet proposal to immediately ban the production and use of atomic energy. It is rumored that several members will question Soviet representative Gromyko in detail about how to prevent the illegal manufacture of atomic bombs. Gromyko spent almost all of last week debating the feasibility of banning atomic bombs, and only briefly mentioned the issue of control. The only control method mentioned by Gromyko was a suggestion that countries pass laws stipulating punishment for those who violate international treaties.</p>

Among them, a "Privy Council Record of Proceedings" dated September 13, 1932, was specifically pointed out by the prosecutor, noting that both defendants Hiranuma and Araki attended the meeting. It is noted that Japan formally recognized Manchukuo and signed the "Japan-Manchukuo" Protocol on September 15, 1932. Two days before, the Japanese side convened a Privy Council meeting, which was also attended by Emperor Hirohito. At that time, Saito was the Prime Minister, Uchida was the Foreign Minister, and Araki was the Army Minister. After the presentation of evidence was completed, Morishima, who previously served at the Consulate General in Shenyang, was called to testify. His testimony stated: At that time, Zhang Zuolin was the supreme military power in Northeast China. Japanese Prime Minister Giichi Tanaka was assisting Zhang, but Tanaka's policy of assisting Zhang was fiercely opposed by officers of the Kwantung Army led by Colonel Daisaku Kawamoto. They believed that Japan's interests should be maintained by force. Among the leaders of this Kwantung Army group who did not listen to reason were Colonel Itagaki, Lieutenant Colonel Ishihara, and Major Hanaya. They attempted to occupy Northeast China, establish a puppet government, separate it from China, and make it an appendage of Japan. At 10:30 p.m. on September 18, they received a phone call from the Special Service Agency stating that the South Manchuria Railway had been blown up. I then met Itagaki and Hanaya at the Kwantung Army Headquarters. Itagaki said, "The Chinese regular army has blown up the South Manchuria Railway, infringing on Japan's major rights and interests. Japan must use force and take appropriate defensive measures." I wanted to persuade them to take peaceful measures, but Hanaya immediately drew his sword and said, "Whoever interferes with the army's command will be killed." From the evening of the 18th to the 19th, Consul General Hayashi repeatedly called Colonel Itagaki, asking him to resolve the incident through peaceful negotiations, and at the same time handed the matter over to the consular officials for handling. However, Itagaki did not comply with the request. At midnight on the 18th, Zhang Xueliang's top advisor also frequently requested the Consul General to advise the Japanese army to stop the attack in order to conduct peaceful negotiations. Although these requests were notified to the Japanese army, they were still ineffective. All Japanese troops in Northeast China then began to act, and the Korean army also crossed the Yalu River to join the battle. In March 1932, the puppet regime was established."</p>

<p>[This Newspaper Dispatch] San Francisco, 1st Broadcast: Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces in Tokyo, MacArthur, Commander of the Pacific Air Force, Lieutenant General Weyland, and Commander of the Occupation Forces, Lieutenant General Eichelberger, issued a joint announcement on Air Force Day to all officers and soldiers under their command, urging them to "be fully armed and prepared."</p>
<p>[United Press Tokyo 1st Dispatch] A B-29 aircraft squadron flew peacefully today over the land where they carried out a terror bombing raid one year ago. The Japanese people all came out of their homes to watch the aircraft group. This was a demonstration for U.S. Air Force Day. The aircraft departed from Okinawa in the early morning, and at twelve noon, twenty-three of them flew over Tokyo at low altitude. One year ago, there were hundreds of aircraft that dropped bombs on Tokyo. One of the aircraft participating in the demonstration crashed yesterday between Guam and Okinawa, but all thirteen crew members parachuted into the water and were rescued.</p>

<p>[United Press Vienna 31st Dispatch] For a thousand years, Russians were highly regarded in European countries and enjoyed great prestige. This is a phenomenon that has only existed since the Bolsheviks came to power. Over the past twelve months, after visiting Central European and Scandinavian countries, a major change in this attitude has been observed. The feeling of doubt towards the Soviet Union has been increasing, and in some cases, this doubt has developed into terror. Today, discussions about how to make the Soviet Union lose the next world war are frequently heard. In the past three or four months, the prestige of the Russians has declined even further. The European people believe that Moscow should be blamed for the rampant activities of the Communist Party. They have also witnessed that in countries under Moscow's influence, important positions in the government, such as internal affairs, military affairs, education, news, and propaganda, are controlled by the Communist Party. Furthermore, in several countries, the ministers of food and foreign affairs are also controlled by the Communist Party. Because the Communist Party controls the internal affairs of various countries, it implements strict police control and a secret service system, and the Party has military departments in various countries to control the army, navy, and air force. Although the sentiments of various countries towards the Soviet Union are not good, these institutions can be used to organize rebellions to protect the existing governments.</p>
<h3 id="e49">MacArthur's Headquarters Economic Section Announces Japan's Export Sweater Plan; Preliminary Negotiations Have Begun with Eastern Countries <a href="#e49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>[United Press Tokyo 31st Dispatch] MacArthur: Japan's trade under control with other countries in the East has already begun preliminary negotiations. Delegations from two countries have arrived in Tokyo. One delegation represents Singapore, the Federation of Malaya, Hong Kong, Burma, Ceylon, and North Borneo, and the other represents Australia. Major Bickel of the Department of Foreign Trade recently went to various Asian countries for trade liaison tasks and has now returned. It is said that Eastern countries need textiles and general daily necessities, while Japan hopes to exchange these exports for the raw materials it needs. Furthermore, according to Fleming, American trading companies will handle Japanese sales. Washington will give final approval to the trade plan, and goods will be directly exchanged between the countries concerned, with settlements made every six months. The International Committee will allocate important items, such as cotton and raw silk, to avoid direct barter. Negotiations are currently underway to study the urgent needs of Japan and its neighbors. It is expected that delegations from China, the Philippines, India, the East Indies, Vietnam, and Siam will come here one after another. The Japan Textile Association reports that the production of cotton yarn and pulp in June of this year has increased two-fold. It must increase month by month in the future to meet the industrial production plan for the second half of the year.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse Tokyo 31st Dispatch] Fleming, the economic director of MacArthur's headquarters, said that Japan's export industry plan is the most ambitious of all plans for defeated countries. In the three months of May, June, and July, the value of Japanese exports exceeded 100 million U.S. dollars. It is expected that it will reach 400 million U.S. dollars in the next six months. China can maintain a trade balance with Japan through the export of salt. The United States is still Japan's best customer and may exchange ornaments for Japanese products. The Soviet Union plans to exchange wool for silk. Eastern countries are willing to exchange phosphates, ramie, and coconut oil for Japanese textiles. This barter trade will be directly negotiated by the governments concerned.</p>
<h3 id="e50">From the Palestine Question (Part 2) - Talking About Britain's Middle East Policy <a href="#e50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>— Xueyan, Special Correspondent in Britain for This Newspaper</p>
<p>The Anglo-American Inquiry Committee</p>
<p>Is an effort to solve the Palestinian dispute. The Anglo-American Investigation Committee inspected the situation of Jews in Europe and Palestine and listened to the opinions of Jewish and Arab representatives. They believe that most of the Jews in Europe now need to find a way out for them, and Palestine is now an armed military camp, which also needs urgent solutions. The investigation team therefore put forward ten suggestions, which can be summarized as follows: (1) Solving the displaced Jews in Europe cannot be accommodated by Palestine alone. It is hoped that other countries with surplus space in the world will also open up to accept them. However, for emergency relief, 100,000 people should be moved to Palestine this year. (2) Given the current crisis in Palestine, the governance rights should continue to be borne by the United Kingdom, and in the future, it may be handed over to the Trusteeship Council of the United Nations. (3) Governing Palestine should be based on the principle of equal coexistence of two ethnic groups, and not with the ideal of establishing a purely national state. (4) The governing authorities should actively take responsibility for improving the education and living standards of the Arabs. The expenses can be transferred from the Jewish tax revenue. (5) The restrictions on land purchase rights should be lifted and replaced with laws to protect poor farmers.</p>
<p>After this report was published,</p>
<p>The reactions in the UK and the US were quite different. The United States only approved the point of moving 100,000 Jews to Palestine this year, while the United Kingdom insisted on implementing the entire "recommendation as a whole," which means delaying the transfer of 100,000 people first. The US government is currently discussing with the US authorities, hoping that the US can jointly take responsibility, and inviting British and American experts to jointly discuss the details of implementation. It will not be implemented temporarily before the negotiations are completed. Britain's rule over Palestine was originally entrusted by the League of Nations, and the United States was not a member. The two can be said to be unrelated. But Britain's involvement of the United States everywhere is naturally due to the actual situation. The United States is the country with the most Jews and the source of aid to the Jews in Palestine. Therefore, cooperating with the United States to solve the problem can be more convenient. The current suggestions not only run counter to the views of the United Kingdom and the United States, but also contradict the current policies of the United Kingdom. There is little that can help Anglo-American cooperation. The method that the UK is currently using is to put aside and delay the so-called expert discussions, which can sometimes be very mysterious. Not to mention the various long-term plans for hundreds of years, which cannot be agreed upon by a few experts at once. Even if we say that 100,000 Jews will be moved this year, if we want to arrange their food, clothing, housing, and transportation, it may not be possible to implement it in one year. The so-called negotiation is probably a joke with the profession. When Bevin mentioned the Palestinian issue at the Industrial Annual Meeting, he said: "There are illegal armed forces in Palestine. If 100,000 more people are moved there, the United Kingdom will have to increase the deployment of a division to suppress them. The United Kingdom is not prepared to do this now." We believe this is a</p>
<p>Very honest explanation of British policy</p>
<p>What exactly does the UK plan to do to solve the Palestinian problem in the future? Does it have a concrete plan now? We don't know. But one point seems certain: the UK has no intention of allowing the Jews to establish a purely Jewish state in Palestine. In the vast area of the Middle East today, it is almost entirely the world of the Arabs, and most of them are British-affiliated colonies. With the development of national consciousness and the strengthening of unity among the various Arab countries, the British are already struggling to cope. Now, in order to solve the problem of hundreds of thousands of scattered Jews, it is exchanging for the hostility of tens of millions of Arabs, which is something the UK will not do. Bevin once said: The Palestinian problem must be solved under the general peace and security problem in the Middle East; in other words, it must be solved with the understanding of the Arabs. This is probably the truth. To understand Britain's attitude towards Palestine, one should observe it from this perspective.</p>
<p>It is not clear now what the original purpose of the United Kingdom in proposing to send a joint Anglo-American investigation team was; but the recommendations of the investigation team obviously run counter to the original intention of the British government, so the British government has adopted a delaying and perfunctory attitude. As for searching Jewish debate groups and arresting a large number of Jews, it is obviously an independent action unrelated to the recommendations of the investigation team. The direct purpose, although in an attempt to eliminate the roots of terrorist activities, the organization that resists the British authorities, but after cracking down on Jewish organizations, will it implement a pressure policy, or will it gradually implement the recommendations of the investigation team after it is slightly quieter? It is still impossible to predict at present. We should wait for the evolution of facts to prove it. (End)</p>

<h3 id="e51">Traffic Problems Are Becoming Increasingly Serious; The City Government Meeting Plans to Improve Them; One Month of Preparation, Implementation Begins Next Month <a href="#e51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>[Taibao Dispatch] At 3 p.m. yesterday, Mayor Wu convened a meeting to improve traffic in the city government meeting room. First, Director Zhao Zengjue of the Public Works Bureau explained that the most important thing to improve the current traffic congestion situation is to abide by traffic discipline and to have close cooperation from the citizens. The reasons for the difficulty of traffic are analyzed as follows: narrow roads, protruding houses on the roadside, insufficient traffic lights, and increased vehicles (after the war, the number of three-wheeled vehicles increased by more than 11,000, the number of rickshaws increased by 4,500, and the number of military trucks increased by about 4,000). Deputy Director Yu of the Police Bureau suggested: Adopt as many one-way traffic methods as possible. Consulting Engineer Lu Binhou suggested: Refer to the method of New York City in the United States, and relatively stipulate the opposite direction for parallel road lines (for example, vehicles on the first street are only allowed to travel east, vehicles on the second street are only allowed to travel west, the third street is east again, and the fourth street is west again, and so on). Consulting Engineer Ye Jiajun suggested: Use fast and slow vehicles as the standard to control them. For example, stipulate that only motorized fast vehicles are allowed to drive on certain main routes, and restrict rickshaws from driving in the central area. Many proposals were made at yesterday's meeting, but the meeting was only for exchanging opinions and was not decisive. Among all the proposals, Deputy Director Yu's one-way traffic is the most practical. In order to reduce traffic difficulties, it was decided: (1) Demarcate parking lots, (2) Stipulate the driving time of heavy vehicles, roughly stipulating three times a day in the morning, noon, and evening, (3) Empty vehicles are not allowed to drive in the busy city center, (4) Strengthen the training of traffic police, (5) After the traffic rules are determined, they will be announced by the city government. It is now decided that August 1st to 15th will be the internal preparation period for the new plan, August 15th will be the publicity week, and traffic knowledge will be instilled to the citizens for two weeks, and it will be effectively implemented in early September.</p>

<p>[This Newspaper Dispatch] The preparatory office of the city's public bus company is planning to open six more public bus routes, traveling between Caojiadu and Ximen Road. The details of the routes have not yet been finalized. Due to the increase in service personnel and the addition of roadside equipment, it may be difficult to operate on schedule in August. It is expected to officially open to traffic in early September. It is reported that the fare will be at most 300 yuan.</p>

<p>[This Newspaper Dispatch] According to a news spokesperson for the Executive Yuan's Material Supply Bureau yesterday: The Material Supply Bureau has established an office in Tianjin, responsible for the purchase and distribution of surplus materials left by the U.S. military in North China. Zheng Daqiang has been appointed as the director of the office and is scheduled to fly to Tianjin this morning to make arrangements. It is also learned that the Material Supply Bureau has allocated 150 jeeps to various cultural institutions in this city, and the allocation has been completed. All the institutions that had applied before but were not approved due to lack of goods have now been registered and will be notified after more arrive. Furthermore, there are still more than 1,600 jeeps from the surplus of the U.S. military on Okinawa waiting for ships to be transported to Shanghai.</p>

<p>[This Newspaper Dispatch] When the Shanghai District Court Prosecutor's Office was ordered to take over the puppet Shanghai District Court Prosecutor's Office in 1945, according to the court police: all the guns of the team were confiscated by Jiang Gongmei, the captain of the military police, in August of the same year, on the grounds that the situation was not yet clear and they might fall into the hands of bandits. Six submachine guns, ninety-five pistols, thirty-six rounds of ammunition, eight Mauser pistols, one hundred and thirty rounds of ammunition, forty holsters, and forty-five rounds of miscellaneous ammunition were confiscated one after another, which was consistent with the files of the puppet office taken over. Later, after the office completed the takeover of the puppet office, the guns should be recovered immediately to restore police force. It then sent personnel to negotiate and request their return. It was then heard that the military police team was ordered to reorganize, and Jiang Gongmei was detained again for the case. It then sent official letters to the 23rd Regiment of the Military Police, the Songhu Garrison Command, and the Sino-British Military Police Command to inquire and contact, but there have been no results to date. The office is eager to strengthen the police force, but after frequent negotiations, the confiscated guns have not been recovered, so it is deeply regrettable.</p>

<p>Fujian and Taiwan groups in Shanghai believe that Taiwan, which has been occupied for 50 years, will soon be one year since its recovery. However, the political facilities and social status under the administrative chief executive system of military and political centralization have not met the expectations of the six million Taiwanese people and have deepened their suffering. Therefore, after a joint meeting a month ago, Chen Rongfang, Yang Zhaojia, Chen Bisheng, and three others were selected as representatives to go to Beijing to petition the National Government, the Legislative Yuan, the Executive Yuan, the Chinese Kuomintang, the Central Party Headquarters, the Supreme National Defense Council, and the National Political Council. They returned to Shanghai the day before yesterday and specially invited reporters yesterday to bitterly describe the recent situation of the people of Taiwan and the results of the petition, requesting assistance from the public opinion community.</p>

Class A household registration: Those who are of good character and have always been law-abiding, 2. Class B household registration: Those who have no special or suspicious circumstances, 3. Class C household registration: Those whose actions and lives are suspicious. After the residents in the area are classified, then decide on a periodic visit.</p>

<p>[This Newspaper Dispatch] According to Mr. Hou Jiaxi of the Zhabei Water and Electricity Company yesterday: The current rotating power outages in factories in Zhabei, Nanshi, and Pudong are not planned measures. Because the current electricity bills are cheap and the demand for electricity exceeds the supply, the boilers of the Shanghai Electric Power Company are overused and often damaged, so they often notify power outages, and there are no regular regulations. However, the factories have been considerably affected by this. If the situation of general households abusing electricity is not improved, there will eventually be a day when there will be widespread rotating power outages. Therefore, it is hoped that citizens can think of the public interest and try to save energy in order to get through the difficult stage.</p>

<p>[This Newspaper Dispatch] The Shanghai branch of the Rotary Club held a dinner yesterday noon at the Dadong Restaurant and invited Dr. Kong Xiangxi to give a speech. More than 90 Chinese and foreign members attended. In his speech, Kong first praised the Rotary Club as a great worldwide unity with a spirit of mutual assistance. He said: "We have experienced two world wars and suffered hardships and destruction. Today, everyone hopes that peace and security can be achieved. The United Nations Conference is about to begin, and the Paris Peace Conference is in progress. People are extremely worried and deeply afraid that it will fail." Kong pointed out that this kind of fear can be eliminated and hard work can be overcome. "We only need to seek mutual understanding and help each other. We must have confidence, patience, courage, and contribute to the welfare of society." He concluded: "The distance between countries in the world has become closer due to the development of air transportation. We are no longer the people of one country or one province, but the descendants of the world. Therefore, I hope that the Rotary Club will dedicate itself to society with the past spirit of mutual assistance, and peace and security will surely be achieved through cooperation."</p>

<h3 id="e64">Formerly a Pickpocket, Now a Chief Captain: Impressions of the Vagrant Vocational Training Center <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>If you often have the opportunity to walk on the streets, then you must often see many beggars, pickpockets, petty thieves, etc., being carried away in prisoner vehicles under the escort of the police. Did you ever wonder at that time where they were being taken? And what would happen after the war?</p>
<p>If you are particularly disgusted by the accumulated garbage in this city, then you must have read a small news item in this section recently—the Bureau of Health used more than 300 vagrants from the Caohejing Vagrant Vocational Training Center to clear accumulated garbage. At the time, you may have lightly ignored it, leaving only the impression that the garbage piles at the door can be cleared day by day, but have you ever thought about who these people who are sweeping the garbage for you are? And what exactly is the so-called "Vagrant Vocational Training Center"?</p>
<p>Recently, a reporter followed Director Zhang Wei of the Bureau of Health to Caohejing to visit the Shanghai Refugee and Orphan Shelter, which is the place where those beggars, pickpockets, petty thieves, etc., are taken in, and the origin of the Vagrant Vocational Training Center, as it was known by this name before the war.</p>
<p>After the police catch these vagrants, they are immediately sent to the Caohejing shelter. When they first arrive, they are covered in scabies and the lice in their hair are matted into balls. The first step is to wash them clean and then treat them. The most common disease is trachoma, with patients accounting for almost nine and a half out of ten. After some cleaning up, they are assigned to various groups according to their age. Those under fourteen are in the children's camp, those from fourteen to sixteen are in the junior camp, those from sixteen to nineteen are in the youth camp, those from nineteen to thirty are in the young adult camp, and those over thirty are in the senior camp. The daily schedules for each camp are different, but everyone has the right to study and the obligation to work.</p>
<p>Assigning Work, Each According to Their Strengths</p>
<p>In addition to being assigned to camps according to age, work is also assigned according to their strengths. Currently, there are sewing classes, carpentry classes, masonry classes, sandal-making classes, shoemaking classes, etc. Their clothes and the equipment in the center, such as tables and chairs, are all made by themselves. Cooking, laundry, cleaning, etc., are all handled by people dedicated to their duties. The perfection of the division of labor and the density of cooperation are unmatched by any other group. Their slogan is "Autonomy and Mutual Assistance," cultivating the concept of "community" from daily life. The principle of daily management is to emphasize both education and cultivation, and to combine work and study. They are taught skills and moved with virtue, with adult education focusing on production and talent being discovered as much as possible.</p>
<p>The refugee and orphan shelter occupies more than ninety acres of land, of which only thirty percent is buildings, and the rest is wasteland. After the hard work of the vagrants, the roads are now level and the fields are well-organized. The shelter has a long history. It is said that during the enemy and puppet occupation, machine guns were set up to manage it, which is very different from the current situation. Currently, there are more than 3,000 people in the shelter, the youngest being three years old and the oldest being seventy-one years old, most of whom are beggars who have fallen into the streets. After only a few months of training, everyone is reluctant to leave this land that belongs to them.</p>
<p>Self-Education, Excellent Results</p>
<p>The shelter was taken over from the enemy and puppet forces and, after reorganization, has been open for only eight months, but the results of these eight months are astonishing! The former notorious "Uncle" pickpockets are now chief captains and are responsible for training others. And now, those who live inside are no longer willing to reveal their past deeds. Unless you force them to answer, "Which police station sent you here?" "What did you do before?" Then they can only blush and blurt out the words "Discussion Record" between their teeth!</p>
<p>When Director Zhang, the reporter, and others visited the shelter, they had already gathered in neat rows on the large square. Under the command of the chief captain, they began the review. The good order and the neatness of the steps were unmatched by any school students! No wonder their director said: "When foreigners come to visit the shelter, we have never disgraced the Chinese people!" This is by no means a boast, but a fact placed before our eyes—they have a fixed schedule for their daily lives, and the corridors are full of wall newspapers. They self-publish textbooks and implement self-education. They have their own bank, court, and consumer cooperative. According to Director Zhang, he personally witnessed them eating, which was even faster and more orderly than monks.</p>
<p>After training, the able-bodied vagrants are eagerly hired by all sectors. Among them, 500 have been sent by the Bureau of Public Works to dredge the Huangpu River, 300 have recently helped the Bureau of Health to clear garbage, and another 500 will be sent by the police to the Northeast to serve as police officers. In the past, they were all dregs wandering the streets, but today they have become producers for society.</p>
<p>Financial Difficulties, Hope for Assistance</p>
<p>It is important to introduce Mr. Ju Zuwang, the director of the shelter. He is still a young man of 29, but he is willing to devote his precious years and youthful vitality to this great work. He sacrifices the enjoyment that young people should have, lives in the shelter, and lives with this group of vagrants. Constant contact has caused him to contract lice and scabies, but he has no complaints. He says that he does not want any reward for doing this work, but the administrative difficulties are indeed discouraging. The funds allocated by the authorities are not even enough for food, and all other equipment, such as medicine, clothing, stationery, and soap, are obtained by the director himself begging from all sectors, and all are in serious panic. Mr. Zhou pulled on a child's clothes and said to the reporter: "This is the only set of clothes he has. If he takes it off, he has no other set." And this only set of clothes was donated by the Shanghai Barber Industry Association. Because once, many barbers visited the shelter and were extremely moved, so they automatically donated a set of clothes to each person. In addition, medicines, etc., are urgently needed, but all are in panic.</p>
<p>We understand the financial difficulties of the municipal government, but a meaningful organization like this must be supported in every way. I believe that everyone, as long as they have the opportunity to go to Caohejing, to see how the vagrants who used to run rampant in the streets and do all kinds of evil are now studying, learning to read, and working peacefully, will be deeply moved. It is now said that the Central Film Studio has decided to make a film about them in the middle of this month, and at the same time, the shelter will host a large-scale reception for reporters. I sincerely hope that the reporters will not miss this opportunity. I also hope that the gentlemen and ladies will take the time to visit, and then I believe you will all extend your helping hands!

<h3 id="e65">Another Episode in the Rong Case: False Accusation Out of Grudge, Claiming He Was a Major Criminal; Ouyang Huang's Attempt Backfires <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from this Newspaper] Just as the Rong Desheng kidnapping case was nearing its end, the Laozha District Police Station suddenly received a secret report from Yao Gengsheng, stating that there was another major criminal in the case, a Cantonese man named Cai Borong, who lived at No. 6 Guangxue Building, Zha Pu Road Bridge, in the Yusheng Customs Brokerage. This person had received USD 35,000, and the informant himself had also received USD 20,000. However, because Cai had bad intentions, he swallowed all of the USD 20,000 that the informant entrusted to him to exchange for legal tender, so he was reporting out of indignation. The report also stated that Cai had previously been bought by the Japanese military to purchase bamboo rafts, gallnuts, kerosene, iron, and other materials. After the victory, he intended to abandon his evil ways and start the Yusheng Customs Brokerage as a false cover. This time, when Zhu Chansheng and Luo Wenqing secretly discussed kidnapping Rong, Cai was also present to plan everything. The police station, considering the case to be of great importance, immediately sent it to the police headquarters for handling. The Second Criminal Investigation Division then dispatched Section Chief Feng Qishan to investigate and arrested Cai Borong at No. 161 Gongjiazhai Road the day before yesterday. After detailed interrogation, it was learned that the report was not true. However, in his confession, it was learned that Ouyang Huang of the Meifeng Customs Brokerage on the third floor of No. 5 Sichuan South Road was very likely the informant in this matter. They pretended to be customers to investigate and asked Ouyang Huang to provide a handwritten note. After comparing the handwriting on the spot, it was found to be completely the same as the handwriting in the secret report. They immediately took him back to the police station. After repeated questioning, he confessed to the false accusation. He claimed that Cai Borong had previously worked in his shop, but after he set up his own Yusheng Customs Brokerage, he took away all of his clients, causing his business to plummet. He had no choice but to resort to this tactic to vent his hatred. The police station, considering the matter to be a false accusation, will send him to court for trial.</p>

<p>[Special Dispatch from this Newspaper] The High Court held a preliminary hearing yesterday morning and a hearing in the afternoon for the case of Yu Geng and Chen Guowei. Yu Geng's father, Yu Daxiong, had served as a counselor in the puppet Ministry of Industry and Commerce and was later killed by our patriotic heroes. However, Yu Geng did not wake up but remained stubbornly attached to the enemy's military police force, serving as an informant. In July of the 32nd year of the Republic [1943], Major Shen Yizhi of the Xi'an Central War Affairs Training Corps was dispatched to Shanghai to recruit students to receive training in the interior. His brother, Shen Suizhi, was a classmate of the second defendant, Chen Guowei, and leaked this information. Chen then colluded with Yu Geng to secretly report to the enemy military police on North Sichuan Road and lured Shen Yizhi to the Cosmopolitan Ballroom on July 11 of that year. The enemy military police, who had been lying in wait there, arrested Shen, and he was soon killed. Later, Yu Geng was transferred to serve as the chief clerk of the Nantong Branch of the puppet Political Security Bureau and the chief of the Special Higher Section of the puppet Danyang County Police Bureau, holding these positions until the enemy surrendered. After the victory, Shen Qin-sun, the father of the victim, reported the two to the authorities, and they were arrested. Yesterday, he personally appeared in court to describe what happened and requested redress. However, the two defendants still evasively denied framing Shen Yizhi. The court ordered that the case be adjourned for further questioning.</p>

After briefly recounting his own hardships of being trapped in a concentration camp for the past three years, Mueller stated that animals are also living beings and should be protected. Mueller also cited the new film "Lassie Come Home" to be released by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, in which the dog Lassie, due to being loved by its owner, was able to remain loyal to its master, which was an extremely touching event. Mueller also stated that the Society for the Protection of Animals has obtained Mayor Wu as a patron and sincerely hopes that the citizens of the city will be able to protect animals and refrain from harming them.</p>
<h3 id="e70">Retirement Fund for Six Major Public Utilities Agreed Upon Yesterday at the Social Affairs Bureau <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>The retirement fund for workers in public utilities in this city has encountered many twists and turns. For example, in July, the British Tramway Company had seventy-two employees requesting retirement, requiring a large sum of money that the company could not afford. Yesterday afternoon at 3 PM, the Social Affairs Bureau specially convened representatives from six major public utilities, including the British Electric Water Company, Gas Company, Water Company, Telephone Company, French Water and Electricity Company, and French Tramway Company, to hold discussions. Director Wu presided over the meeting. After three hours of heated debate, a draft of the regulations was drawn up as follows: (1) Employees requesting retirement should be over 60 years of age, physically weakened, and unable to work. (2) If they are under 60 years of age but are indeed physically weak or unable to serve, they should be certified by a doctor. (3) Retirement funds totaling less than 5 million legal tender should be fully paid. (4) For retirement funds totaling 7.5 million legal tender, the excess of 2.5 million should be paid at 70% of the amount. (5) For retirement funds totaling between 7.5 million and 10 million legal tender, the excess should be paid at 50% of the amount. (6) For retirement funds over 10 million legal tender, the excess should be paid at 35% of the amount. (7) The number of people requesting retirement each month should not exceed one-tenth of the company's total monthly salary. (8) The above regulations are temporary in nature, and permanent regulations are still under discussion. It is reported that the above regulations will be submitted to today's municipal meeting for approval.</p>

<p>[Special Dispatch from this Newspaper] The Hsing Chung General Machinery Assembly and Repair Factory hosted a visit for the city's press yesterday morning. The factory is currently located on the former site of Jinan University in Zhenru. All kinds of engineering machinery and parts are U.S. surplus materials. Approximately 20,000 to 25,000 tons have already been shipped to the factory, approximately 50,000 tons have been unloaded in Shanghai, approximately 30,000 tons are moored on ships in the harbor, and in addition, there are 48 ships of machinery already en route to China, so the total number is quite considerable. These machines are already surplus materials in the U.S., but for our country, they are still new things. The factory's work includes four items: (1) Ensuring that all machines are available for use. (2) Assembling and completing various scattered machines by category. (3) Introducing the most suitable machines wherever needed. (4) Fully supplying the necessary fuel, lubricants, replacement parts, and tools for the use of various machines. As for training, the most important thing is to understand all aspects of technical talents and workers who can use the machines. Currently, many students from Zhongda, Jiaoda, and Su Gong are receiving training at the factory, and there are already more than 200 artisans. All work is gradually being carried out. Yesterday, the person in charge of the factory, U.S. engineer Mr. Heath, guided the tour of various parts and various oiling machines, cranes, mobile workshops, sprinklers, road repair machines, mud-digging machines, etc., and the trainees demonstrated their use. Machines were piled up like small hills everywhere on the site. Although most of them were mottled and rusty, they were still valuable materials for our backward country. According to Mr. Heath's words to reporters, the factory is determined to work in shifts to ensure that it is working 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, without a moment of leisure.</p>

<p>[Special Dispatch from this Newspaper] On the morning of July 7, two men in military uniform and carrying weapons suddenly came to the Jinxing Car Dealership at No. 251 Zhongzheng East Road. They claimed to be the sixth team in the Jinghu District Garrison Headquarters and said that they were ordered by the team leader to arrest the boss, Li Yuanchun (also known as Li Zhizhu), because he had provided all kinds of transportation to the Ling Zhong team leader in the puppet organization, but discriminated against their team, which was very hateful. At that time, they were very fierce. After the shop assistants politely told them that Li had gone to Suzhou, they even took out guns to intimidate the assistants and automatically went up and down the building to search for about 20 minutes before leaving. The next night, a man named Zhang Guansheng came, pretending to inquire about the matter, and then offered to mediate. Three days later, Zhang came again and said that he had reached an agreement with the front, and that ten gold bars were needed to settle the matter. Li's wife and others repeatedly pleaded to reduce the amount. On the 14th, they first collected 1.3 million legal tender in cash and a check for 700,000 (dated the 20th) and sent them to Zhang Guansheng at No. 15 Tonghe Lane, Beijing Road, agreeing to pay another 5 million on the 25th at the same place. Afterwards, the shop owner returned to Shanghai from Suzhou and, together with lawyer Ma Junshuo, reported the matter to the Huangpu District Police Station. The police station arrested Zhang Guansheng on the 25th. During the interrogation, Zhang confessed that he was instructed by Zhang Ximing, who lived at No. 148 Shuntian Village, Chengdu Road. His accomplices were Cai Dezhong and Yang Zhimou. He had previously served as the puppet village chief of Xulu Township, Chuansha County. Cai Dezhong and Zhang Ximing had set up the Zhentaihua Company at No. 15 Tonghe Lane to cover up their enemy activities. It is reported that the main culprit, Zhang Ximing, is at large, and the police are pursuing him.</p>

<p>UNRRA has recently shipped soybean flour as part of its relief food supplies. Misunderstandings can easily arise if the proper methods for consumption are not known. Soybean flour differs in nature from ordinary wheat flour, as it contains no gluten and has a low starch content, so it cannot be made into bread on its own. However, it is very nutritious. As for methods of consumption, when making steamed buns, cookies, cream soup, egg rolls, vegetable rolls, and meat rolls, soybean flour can be mixed with other flours at a ratio of 20%. A small amount of soybean flour can also be added when cooking porridge. It can be made into soy milk by mixing it with water, cooking for ten minutes, and adding sugar or salt. A certain amount of soybean flour can also be added before stir-frying fish or meat. Stored in a dry, cool place, it can last for a long time.</p>

<p>[Report from this newspaper] Xinben Girls' Middle School, located at No. 57 Zhengjia Lane, West Ames Road, has been established for nine years. Recently, a dispute over premises has arisen because the landlord, Jin Handing (Director of the Third Inspection Group on Military Discipline of the Military Affairs Commission), has forced them to vacate. On July 6, when Xinben Girls' Middle School Principal Shen Ming returned to his hometown to attend a funeral, Jin took back all the premises and forbade students from entering. When Principal Shen heard the news and rushed back, the flag of the "Office of the Third Inspection Group on Military Discipline" was hanging high at the school gate. According to Principal Shen's statement to our reporter: When the school premises were rented, the landlord voluntarily advertised for tenants in the newspaper. At that time, because Jin Handing was not in Shanghai, everything was handled by his agent, Li Liang, who received a transfer fee and a large rental deposit. In previous years, the landlord had acknowledged five times that the school had difficulty finding new premises and allowed it to postpone the move. This time, the landlord gave no written or verbal notice before the end of the year and suddenly took back the premises, which is unreasonable in terms of both sentiment and reason. The school had sent representatives to plead with him several times, but Jin replied: "It is definitely impossible to run a school here. You should all transfer to another school as soon as possible!" But in these days of the school's most serious panic, to banish a group of students outside the gate of "Xinben," where do you ask them to go?</p>
<p>It is now learned that ten representatives from the Shanghai Municipal Joint Association of Primary and Secondary Schools, including Jiang Jizhou, Yang Yushen, and Yu Chuanding, flew to Nanjing yesterday morning to petition the authorities on this matter.</p>

<h3 id="e89">Yuan Dunli Flies from Nanjing to Peiping; Remarks Before Departure; Entrusted by the Ministry of Education to Hire Several American Physical Education Teachers <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>[Report from our Nanjing Office] Yuan Dunli, President of the National Northwest Normal College, flew from Nanjing to Peiping on the morning of the 31st. Before his departure, he spoke to our reporter about his observations on the recent state of physical education in America, which is summarized below: In addition to studying education in America, Yuan visited and inspected twenty-nine physical education departments at American universities, five health education departments, two military academy physical education programs, three physical education colleges, eight county and city health education programs, three physical education facilities at veterans' hospitals, and nine research institutions concerned with child development. He also spoke with 400 people involved in health and physical education in America. The theories of American physical education have not changed.</p>
<p>Physical Education During Wartime</p>
<p>However, in order to adapt to the needs of combat, the army, navy, and air force have increased physical education training, with four to five hours of physical training per day, with a four-month period to complete the task and purpose. However, after the end of the war, this training was stopped and normalcy was restored. In addition, physical training for wounded soldiers was implemented. Each veterans' hospital had physical education instructors who used physical training and various recreational activities to keep the wounded soldiers happy and quickly restore their health. According to surveys and statistics, this can shorten the hospital stay of the wounded soldiers by one-third. Regarding the recreational activities of the American public, including sports, as well as art, labor, and music, public officials mostly go to recreational venues and public recreation centers in their spare time for beneficial physical and mental recreation. In terms of dance, American folk dances, Old America Dances, and Square Dances, have been revived, with dancers wearing ancient costumes and graceful movements. Modern dance is also very developed.</p>
<p>Physical Education</p>
<p>Yuan was entrusted by the Ministry of Education to hire American physical education teachers. After consultation with American physical education celebrity Mike Le, it was decided to hire five male teachers and two female teachers (emphasizing skills), and a cable was sent to the Ministry of Education through the embassy in early April to request remittance of travel expenses. When he returned to the country, he did not receive a reply, so he could not confirm it. After returning to the country, he learned that the money had been remitted in mid-June, but it was too late. Moreover, the current cost of living in our country is three times higher than in the United States, and the restoration of various schools is not yet fully underway due to transportation limitations. Therefore, the planned hiring of American physical education teachers will have to be delayed.</p>
<p>Lectures by Celebrities</p>
<p>Yuan contacted American physical education celebrities Mike Le and William to come to China to give lectures. Mike is currently in charge of physical education in Iowa, but due to pension issues, he cannot come to China on his own. Our country needs to request a leave of absence from American schools on his behalf. If he can come to China, he will come to China in the summer of 1947 to give lectures for half a year, but it is necessary to gather senior physical education practitioners in our country in advance to prepare for listening to and studying the lectures. The research topics are approximately physical education curriculum, human kinetics, physical education theory, physical education testing, and methods of physical education research. William is a professor in the physical education department at Columbia University and has now retired. If he comes to China, he can stay for one or two years. He is deeply aware of the hardships of China's war of resistance and its economic difficulties, and he hopes to find funding from the United States to come to China to work. However, it is first necessary to conduct a survey of the state of physical education throughout China and then formulate a national physical education plan, and to convene twenty or thirty senior physical education personnel to engage in lectures and research work. In addition, the American physical education community is enthusiastic about supporting our country. Under the leadership of Nasp, a fundraising campaign has been launched in the United States to donate physical education books to our country.</p>

<p>[Report from our Nanjing Office] The World Games of 1948 will be held in London, England. Although we have already sent a letter to Dr. Wang Tingbao in the United States to represent us at the preparatory meeting for the World Games to be held in Venice in three years, our country must make full preparations for the future National Games in order to participate. Therefore, it is necessary to convene our country's National Games. The Ministry of Education also discussed this matter at the last meeting of the Sports Committee. Because there is not enough time this year, it is planned to hold the National Games on the Double Tenth Festival next year. Some advocate holding it in the Northeast, because holding it in the Northeast is more deeply meaningful, and the venue and personnel are more convenient. Others advocate holding it in Nanjing, but the Central Stadium has been completely destroyed. If it is held in Nanjing, it is necessary to quickly repair the venue. As a result of the discussion, the matter was handed over to the Sports Committee for special handling. In the future, it will be held in either the South or the North.</p>
<p>[Report from our Nanjing Office, 1st] The Ministry of Education plans to establish a National Central Stadium in Nanjing after the autumn of this year and has submitted a request to the Executive Yuan for an additional budget to facilitate its implementation.</p>
<h3 id="e95">After Nine Years Away, Hu Shih Returns to the Old Capital <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent for this Newspaper in Peiping, Song Shaobo</p>
<p>The cultural capital, which had lost its luster after a long period of occupation, has clearly gained a lot of vitality with the illustrious return of Hu Shih. Upon arriving in Peiping, Mr. Hu immediately took more than an hour to have a lively conversation with reporters in Peiping.</p>
<p>A little after five o'clock in the afternoon, Dr. Hu walked into the room, saying "Sorry, sorry!" while repeatedly clasping his hands in greeting. His face was full of smiles, and he seemed even more shy than he was nine years ago. Dressed in a gray silk long gown, silk trousers, and black shoes, and constantly waving a folding fan, his scholarly demeanor was now tinged with the air of a diplomat, which was something that wasn't there before. Fu Sinian, wearing shorts and a short-sleeved shirt, sat opposite him, adding a lot of humor to the on-site conversation, trying to chime in from time to time and help Dr. Hu out of some tight spots. In the end, he got Hu's eldest son (Zu Wang) to rescue Mr. Hu and get him out of there.</p>
<p>Mr. Hu made a very good impression on the reporters. First, he didn't use official jargon. Speaking of his departure from the old capital, he said with some emotion: "Two days after the July 7th Incident, I left Peiping to attend a meeting in Guling. On July 28th, Peiping fell. That day I went down the mountain to Nanjing. On September 20th, I flew to America from Hong Kong. This time, my return is exactly nine years later. The schools in Peiping have suffered little damage, and the scenery is still the same. I am very happy, especially since I have seen almost all of my old friends today. But my old friends Qian Xuantong, Ma Yuzhao, and Meng Sen (Xin Shi) have passed away."</p>
<p>(1) On Freedom, in Light of the Li-Wen Bloodshed Incident</p>
<p>Regarding the affairs of Peking University, Mr. Hu pushed everything onto Fu Sinian, thanking him for the assistance. As for national affairs, he said that he had been away for nine years and knew too little, so he would have to be a first-year student for a year and read nine years' worth of newspapers before he could speak. The topic then turned to the Li-Wen bloodshed incident. "I am not familiar with Li Gongpu, but I have been old friends with Wen Yiduo for more than ten years." He praised Wen's academic achievements, lamented Wen's death, and, moved by emotion, began to talk about the issue of freedom. He said: "People should have a spirit of tolerance, that is, Tolerance. One must have freedom for oneself, but must also respect the freedom of others. For example, I, Hu Shih, am an atheist, but I should fight for the freedom of belief for those who believe in God. Freedom of belief, expression, and speech is indispensable. The spirit of freedom of the Anglo-Saxons in Western Europe is valuable. This was the spirit of Peking University in the past, where Gu Hongming taught with a queue [Manchu hairstyle], and Liu Guanghan organized a security association for the royalist party and gave lectures as well, without excluding each other. This is the glorious and great legacy of Cai Yuanpei. Peking University will definitely continue to maintain this spirit in the future." Mr. Hu asked the reporters to promote this spirit.</p>
<p>(2) In General, China Has Progressed</p>
<p>Mr. Hu reminded people not to doubt the future because of individual trivial matters, and even more not to be pessimistic. He said: "In general, China has progressed." He gave an example: "In Nanjing, Mr. Wang Shijie and Mr. Zhu Jiahua both held tea parties for me. At these tea parties, I saw Communist Party members such as Zhou Enlai and Dong Biwu participating. At the first United Nations General Assembly, Dong Biwu also represented the Chinese government. In Beijing and Shanghai, there was Communist Party intelligence circulating on the market. These are all symbols of progress, and I hope they will continue to develop." On this issue, Mr. Hu recalled that Mao Zedong seemed to have been an auditor at Peking University, but Fu Sinian interjected, saying, "No, no, we shouldn't take credit for that! Fan Wenlan was a more prominent scholar at Peking University."</p>
<p>Because they were discussing freedom, some reporters asked, for example, about the Shanghai Wenhui Bao being suspended for a week. Mr. Hu said that according to American practice, if one feels oppressed, one can sue. Then someone asked about the prospects for the negotiations between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party. Before Mr. Hu could speak, Mr. Fu Sinian chimed in again. A reporter then said, "We are asking Mr. Hu, please Mr. Fu do not speak at this time." Mr. Hu then repeatedly said that Mr. Fu was his agent, but still avoided the question: "We who do historical research need to make a big deal out of small things, extending from a small problem to others. This problem is too big to examine."</p>
<p>(3) Two Major Obstacles to Vernacular Chinese</p>
<p>Someone asked Mr. Hu to review the New Culture Movement. He said: "This problem is too big to say, but I feel that in the New Culture Movement, there are still two major obstacles in front of vernacular Chinese. First, the government is too unliberated. Even now, official documents and telegrams are still written in classical Chinese. The second is the news media. Six or seven out of ten of the current newspapers are still written in classical Chinese." Mr. Hu believed that it would be perfectly fine to use vernacular Chinese for all of these, and he praised the vernacular news telegram from Puyang in the Ta Kung Pao as an example. He strongly advocated using vernacular Chinese to create one's own literary style and express one's own opinions. The language used in broadcasting is even more important. He said: "I saw an article by Mr. Hu Xiansu in the Ta Kung Pao the other day, and he actually used fifty or sixty sentences in vernacular Chinese in it! This is truly a great pleasure for me, Hu Shih!" Hu Xiansu was one of the strongest opponents of vernacular Chinese.</p>
<p>Because they were discussing vernacular Chinese in newspapers, some people asked Mr. Hu to criticize the Communist Party's newspapers. Mr. Hu said: "I haven't been to the Liberated Areas, so I can't comment." Then someone asked: "If you have the opportunity, will you go?" "I will definitely go!" At this time, Mr. Fu Sinian chimed in again: "When you go, you must ask Miss X to be your guide because Miss X has been to Zhangjiakou." The so-called Miss X was the person who asked Mr. Fu not to speak. And Miss X said: "Mr. Fu has been to Yan'an, so the guide should be Mr. Fu!" A small dispute was overshadowed by another question: "What do Americans really think of China?"</p>
<p>(4) No Change in US Policy Towards China</p>
<p>"The United States' policy towards China has been consistent for more than a hundred years. Although individual different views have been expressed, the basic policy of the 'Open Door' has not changed." Mr. Hu then explained the "Open Door" policy: "This is not equal benefits, but rather not allowing any one country to dominate China, because that would cause war. The majority of Americans hope that China will succeed in becoming a modern, democratic, peaceful, unified, and prosperous country, so that there can be equal opportunity. The fact that someone with exceptional talent like Marshall came to mediate the problem is a reflection of this policy."</p>
<p>(5) He Wrote Poetry to Advise Zhou Zuoren</p>
<p>Mr. Hu stated that he would not criticize Zhou Zuoren, because "it would be painful to say anything to an old friend of many years at this time," especially when he is about to be sentenced. Mr. Hu said that at the beginning of the War of Resistance Against Japan, he wrote a poem to Zhou, advising him to go to the rear, and Zhou also responded with a poem, saying that he could not leave now, but hoping that he would be believed that he would not do anything to let down his friends. Both poems were published in the newspaper by Zhou Zuoren.</p>
<p>(6) The Future is Long, Ask Me Less for Now</p>
<p>A female reporter asked Mr. Hu whether his criticism of women's university education in China was appropriate. Mr. Hu stated that the question should be left to experts to discuss, but said that the liberation of Chinese women was a great page in history. The least beautiful Chinese women in the past have now become one of the most beautiful women in the world. Seeing several female reporters present, he said that there are not as many female reporters in the United States as there are male reporters, but there are more female teachers than male teachers in primary and secondary schools. In China, men and women still do not have equal opportunities.</p>
<p>There were too many questions, and Mr. Hu felt that he could not answer them all, so he finally said: "I will not leave Peiping for a year or two. The future is long, ask me less for now." He said: "Shui Jing Zhu is my hobby, and has nothing to do with the War of Resistance, democracy, or peace. What I studied in America was the history of Chinese thought. The English lectures can be printed after a year. Doctors don't allow large-scale lectures. At the same time, it is difficult to maintain order, so it is best not to give lectures to avoid trouble." At this time, his eldest son came to urge him to leave. A female reporter joked: "Are you Hu Shih's son?" because she remembered Dr. Hu's poem "My Son." (July 29, 1946)</p>
<p>Brief Report on Civil Administration</p>
<h3 id="e96">District Offices Reassigning Service Personnel; City Government Promulgates Three Salary Payment Methods Yesterday <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>Regarding how to handle the reassignment of service personnel because the salary scales of Class A districts were higher than those of Class B districts, the Civil Affairs Department submitted a report to the City Government for instructions, which were approved as follows: "Upon inspection of the Shanghai Municipal Government's Salary Comparison Table for District Security Personnel previously promulgated by this government, the salary scales for all levels of personnel are based on qualifications, which are inherently flexible and can be adjusted. As for reassignments, they should be handled in accordance with the Civil Servant Appointment Law and the Civil Servant Grade Regulations." The instructions are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) For those reassigned from a Class B district to a Class A district to serve in their original position, their salary, which has already been approved by this government during their tenure in the Class B district, should still be paid at the original salary. If they are promoted to a higher position or as a supervisor, they may be promoted by one grade. (2) For those reassigned from a Class A district to a Class B district, regardless of whether they are reassigned to their original position, promoted to a higher position, or as a supervisor, their salary grade, even if it has been approved by this government during their tenure in the Class A district, should still be in accordance with the comparison table and should not exceed the highest salary grade stipulated for their original position in the Class B district, so as not to affect the budget. However, the original salary approved by this government during their tenure in the Class A district may be retained, and they may still be paid at the original salary grade if they are reassigned to a Class A district or other units of this government. (3) The salary for assistant staff members does not differentiate between Class A and Class B districts, and is uniformly compared from Grade 11 to Grade 8 of the commissioned rank.</p>

<p>(9) Q: Taking a concubine cannot be registered as a marriage, but how should their children be registered?</p>
<p>A: The registration of concubines should be in accordance with Article 12 of the Instructions for Filling Out Forms, which stipulates that concubines taken before the implementation of the Family Law of the Civil Code should be filled in as concubines, and those taken after should be temporarily filled in as family members. The children born to them should be registered as legitimate children only after they have been recognized or raised by the biological father in accordance with Article 1065 of the Civil Code. If the concubine is the head of the household, she does not need to be recognized in accordance with paragraph 2 of the same article.</p>
<p>(10) Q: How should Muslims who have only received religious education and studied Arabic be filled out in the education level column?</p>
<p>A: In the education level column, fill in "Studied Arabic for several years."</p>
<p>(11) Q: How should those who have received ordinary or professional training in central or local agencies and those who have graduated from various military academies be filled out in the education level?</p>
<p>A: If there is no academic qualification, those who have graduated from central training institutions should be temporarily regarded as having a university degree, and those who have graduated from provincial and county training institutions should be regarded as having a high school or junior high school degree, respectively.</p>
<p>(12) Q: According to regulations, those who are employed or serving in the military should be listed in the unemployed column, but how can the true number of unemployed people be clearly understood?</p>
<p>A: When compiling statistics, those who are studying and serving in the military can be replaced with different codes. When filling out the form, the three categories of unemployed, studying, and military service should be combined and recorded in the table, and the number of students and military personnel should be noted in the remarks column to easily understand the true number of unemployed people.</p>
<p>(13) Q: People's occupations and education levels change from time to time. After the first registration, how should changes be filled in?</p>

<h3 id="e102">Quenching Thirst with Plums, with the Leftover Cloth; Old Illnesses and New Symptoms of the Cotton Cloth Industry; High Interest Rates and Heavy Pressure Force Closures <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] Since the turmoil caused by the "Six Bonds Public Debt", financial institutions have tightened credit, which has hit factories and stores that usually rely on overnight loans and discounted bills for capital turnover. The impact has not yet subsided, and the cotton cloth industry is one of the hardest hit. Since the enemy and puppet regimes forcibly purchased yarn and cloth, inventories have been depleted. Only those stores that focus on operating silk, satin, woolens, and newly produced cloths and threads can barely maintain their business. However, due to the losses from forced purchases, their vitality has been greatly impaired, and their situation is not as good as before. Taking the three famous "Xiang" stores as an example, the quantity of their inventory and manpower is far from comparable to the past. As for wholesale stores, many have closed down. Those that have not removed their signs either intend to retain their qualification as a cotton cloth store to wait for an opportunity, or still hope that the government can fairly return the surplus of yarn and cloth that was forcibly purchased by the puppet regime. Among them, the three "Rixin" stores, which have always been praised by local and foreign merchants, are no longer what they were. Rixin Zeng has long been taken over and now sells general merchandise (including cotton thread products); Rixin Sheng's door is half-closed, looking bleak, almost like a desolate temple; and Rixin Chang has long been closed. According to sources from the Cotton Cloth Industry Association:</p>
<p>A Matter of Life and Death: Whether or not the confiscated yarn and cloth can be returned is a matter of life and death for the industry. It is still planned to make repeated efforts to make a strong appeal to the relevant parties. During the industry's decline, only the Zhengjia Bridge and Nanyang Bridge areas have seen a considerable number of newly emerging cloth stores with smaller scales in recent years. For several months before a month ago, there was superficially a period of activity. But since the "Gongda Cotton Cloth Store" ran aground, rumors and panic spread, and the market became very cautious. Based on the nature of small profits and quick turnover, the capital is too heavy and the interest rates are too high, so there is really nothing left to profit. Since the financial situation at the end of June changed, financial institutions tightened credit.</p>
<p>Lack of Capital: Those who are most affected in the cotton cloth industry are mostly these kinds of stores, because the reason why they have small profits and quick turnover is partly because they have to keep turning the capital over as many times as possible. Moreover, a part of them borrowed short-term loans to order foreign goods. The loans are now due, and creditors are demanding payment.</p>
<p>Order Cancellations Lead to Collapse: The crisis has been brewing, and Gongda is one example. Recently, another "Xiang" store has run aground, but its impact is not as great as that of Gongda. However, both those in the industry and those outside the industry are very disheartened. According to talks with those who are worried about the industry, interest rates are now too high, and what businesses in the industry earn is often not enough to cover the interest.</p>
<p>Spinning and Weaving Separation and Distribution: If spinning mills set up distribution points everywhere in other provinces, the road for merchants in the industry will become narrower. In this situation, with both internal and external strikes, it is really not a good situation. Recently, a large dyeing and weaving factory, with 200,000 yuan of capital that could not circulate, was forced by the Guanggang [Cantonese business community] to run aground. Therefore, the merchants are also wary of dyeing and weaving factories. According to informed sources, the factory is expected to resume operations soon. Dyeing and weaving factories are, after all, factories with real strength, which are different from shell stores, but they plan to implement measures to save expenses. According to sources in the financial industry, the most welcome for lending now are yarn factories, while the joys and sorrows of dyeing and weaving factories and the cotton cloth industry are in inverse proportion to the yarn factory industry.</p>
<h3 id="e103">Gold Yarn Rises <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the price of raw silk gradually stabilized. The industry and the Cantonese business community absorbed some of it, and it gradually improved. It opened in the morning at 1,872,000, and the levy did not change significantly. It struggled for a long time at around 1,870,000. After 10:00 AM, the Central Bank allocated 53 items at a price of 1,867,500. After that, it was mediocre. Near noon, the currency situation, the industry, and the Cantonese business community paid the levy, and it rose to around 1,880,000. As a result, it rose by 5,000 compared to the previous levy. Gold ornaments and silver were flat, the silver dollar fell, and the dark discount was also set. The interest rate was around one-tenth and three-hundredths.</p>
<p>The opening trend of foreign currency was promising. Although the morning opening price of American yarn was below 2,500 yuan, arbitrage activity was continuous. The process gradually increased slightly in an extremely stable manner. At noon, the price rose to 2,520 yuan. In the afternoon, it was stable and unchanged. As a result, it rose by 10 yuan compared to the previous close. The arbitrage price for gold was calculated to be 746 yuan per ten taels. The Hong Kong dollar was initially flat and then stable, with sellers from the US dollar side. As a result, it rose by another 5 yuan. The Hong Kong exchange rate was still constrained by the report of 182 from Hong Kong, remaining at 550 yuan to 555 yuan. Indian exchange rates were mostly traded at 665 yuan. Both British and American exchange rates were calm and unchanged.</p>
<h3 id="e104">Government Bonds See Some Trading <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>Government bond trading became more active, with slightly stronger demand. However, general bonds remained in a state of confusion. The morning opening was at 760 yuan, and a certain store on the 5th floor briefly became active. It fell from 770 yuan to 720 yuan, but rebounded near noon, hovering around 750 yuan. As a result, it closed the same as before. Class A, B, and D all rose by 10 yuan. General Bonds were the most colorful, continuing to rise by 40 yuan.</p>

<p>Second Ship Expected Next Week</p>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] The French postal company's cargo ship Ying Guang'an, carrying 2,500 tons of rice from Saigon, a total of 25,000 bags, arrived at the port the day before yesterday evening and was docked at buoy No. 11 on line No. 2 of Yi Wharf. Unloading began yesterday. According to the company, the second ship, Auguste Ciavec, also loaded 1,500 tons of rice from Saigon and set sail yesterday, and is expected to arrive in Shanghai next Monday. The above mentioned foreign rice was all purchased by the Central Trust Bureau.</p>

<p>A news agency reported that 10,000-yuan-denominated banknotes had been discovered in Shaoxing. According to the person in charge of the competent authority, the so-called 10,000-yuan banknotes are all rumors. The banknotes issued by the government still have a maximum denomination of 2,000 yuan, and there are currently no plans to issue new banknotes with denominations larger than 2,000 yuan. If these 10,000-yuan banknotes are discovered, they must be counterfeit or have the denomination altered.</p>

<p>Yesterday, although there were goods shipped out from Chaoqing in the city, because they were destined for Zhong, the market price showed a firm trend, with offers increasing by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. The Shantou business community opened with Grade A refined sugar at 19,000 yuan, and Huanggang Qing was at 85,000-86,000 yuan, up by 1,000 yuan, and the next grade was at 84,000 yuan, with 200-300 bags traded. The Jian business community opened with Grade A Refined Sugar at 87,000 yuan, and the next grade was initially at 500-6,000 yuan, with 100+ bags traded. The Xinghua business community opened with the top grade Gongfen white at 134,000 yuan, and the middle grade was at 127,000-128,000 yuan. The Guangzhou business community opened with Louzhuang Pianqing at 77,000 yuan and Xiangzhuang at 80,000 yuan, with dozens of pieces traded.</p>
<h3 id="e108">Xing Siyuan Rises <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>Because Xinghua Siyuan has been lacking in arrivals recently, and most merchants are holding firm, the market trend has turned upward. The top-grade Siyuan opened yesterday with an increase of about 10%. Other Quanzhou Tong'an goods have also tightened accordingly.</p>
<h3 id="e109">Yarn and Cloth Remain Sluggish; Raw Cotton Rebounds <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the yarn market was slightly more stable. The Guangzhou business community slightly increased their buying volume, but the amount was limited. Shuangma was priced between 1,280,000 and 1,290,000 yuan. The sales of small and medium-sized yarns remained sluggish, and prices continued to soften by about 10,000 yuan. 16-count yarn fell by about 20,000-30,000. People's confidence remained weak.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the New York American cotton wire suddenly soared by another 200 pounds. The prices were: the recent American gold was $33.74, the new long-term cotton was $30.85, and the current price of Midtlin cotton was $43.53. The two Shenxin factories in this port purchased Midtlin grade wool raw materials. Other factories remained on the sidelines. Stimulated by the sharp rise in American cotton, the market price rose by about 1,000-2,000 yuan.</p>
<p>The cloth market remains sluggish, and the market in other provinces is also weak. Merchants stand by and watch, so trading is very sluggish. The broadcloth market price is decreasing step by step. The China Trust's bidding continues unabated, and the chips are greatly loosened. It is becoming more and more difficult for the market situation to rebound. However, there are few high-quality goods, and the Seven Guardians have slightly absorbed them. The rest have fallen across the board. At noon, Bianjian opened for sale, with prices falling by 500 yuan to 1,000 yuan compared to the last time. There were few buyers.</p>
<h3 id="e110">Financial Stability Maintained Throughout the Week <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The financial situation in the city this week can be described as calm and stable, with no significant issues in the banking sector. On the final day of the week, the city's clearing house exchanged a total of over 63,000 checks. The total value of the exchanged checks was over 144 billion yuan. The total number of returned checks was over 2,000, with a value of approximately 3 billion yuan. These figures did not show any significant change from the usual daily operations and were all within normal ranges.</p>
<h3 id="e111">Powerful Players Maintain Control with Ease: Evergreen Cotton Stands Out <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>Chinese stocks continued to follow the trend of the previous days. Evergreen Cotton stood out, while American-Asia plummeted. Major, influential players continued to manipulate the market with ease. However, after Evergreen Cotton reached a new high, there was a feeling that the market should be suppressed, and some inventory was released, causing a slight dip. During the day, Evergreen Cotton reached a high of 745 yuan, while American-Asia hit a low of 3,650 yuan. The three smaller stocks saw a balance of supply and demand, and the market wavered. The stock market has deviated from its normal path, and the chaos may continue to increase. Compared to the previous close, Evergreen Cotton rose another 20 yuan, while American-Asia fell by half. Among the three smaller hot stocks, Jingfu remained stable, while Xingguang and Qinxing saw slight declines. Among the less active small and medium-sized stocks, some gained and some lost. Established stocks remained stable.</p>
<p>Foreign stocks saw the emergence of a major player, Dacheng, who was waiting patiently to buy up shares of Ewo Cotton, which was the most eye-catching. Other stocks were also passively boosted. There were rumors that Ewo Brewery had a large amount of stock dumped from Hong Kong, but this was not confirmed. Ewo Cotton opened at 8,800 and rose to 9,700 before settling. As a result, compared to the previous close, Ewo Cotton rose by 10%, while Ewo Brewery remained unchanged. British and Chinese Corporation and Asiatic Petroleum Company each rose by about half a percent. Paper and Guangzhou also rose, but not by much.</p>
<h3 id="e112">7,000 Loads of Cooking Oil to Arrive Soon; Director Wu Meets with Oil Mill Representatives <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>Director Wu of the Social Affairs Bureau met with representatives Li Tingdong and Zhang Decheng yesterday morning to discuss the cooking oil situation in the city. He inquired about the reasons for the price fluctuations, and the representatives provided a factual report, detailing the mill's distribution methods, organization, and targets. Director Wu expressed satisfaction with the distribution system. As for how to suppress the rising prices, Director Wu believed that two measures should be taken: to streamline the source and increase production. The former involves the city government directly contacting the production areas to request assistance with exports, while the latter involves requesting the power company to make every effort to supply electricity. It was also learned that the mill had shipped 1,000 loads of crude oil from Hubei to Qingdao yesterday. At the same time, China Edible Oil Corporation loaded 7,000 loads at the same location, which will arrive in Shanghai soon.</p>
<h3 id="e113">Rice Merchants' Appetite Greatly Reduced; Both Japonica and Indica Prices Decline <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the total registration of goods and customers in the North and South rice markets reached 5,838 stones, with 3,702 stones in the North market and 2,136 stones in the South market. Rice merchants' appetite was greatly reduced, with supply exceeding demand in both markets. Rice merchants were reluctant to buy, and the market was in a slump. Prices fell across the board, with Japonica rice dropping sharply by 2-3,000 yuan, and Indica rice lacking buyers, continuing to fall by 3-4,000 yuan. Customer prices dropped by 4-5,000 yuan. The source of new Japonica rice was just over 100 stones, with a further drop of 3,000 yuan. The flour market was stagnant, with retailers watching and waiting. Imported flour continued to be sold, with morale low, dropping by 3-400 yuan. Although there were inquiries about wheat from Ningbo, transactions were few. There was a lack of transactions from Fujian and Shantou, and the market weakened by 4-500 yuan. Bran also followed suit, dropping by 1-200 yuan. Soybean production prices were high, with limited sources. There was some slight buying, and the market seemed firm, with a trend towards stability. Raw peanuts dropped by 1-2,000 yuan. The oil market was sluggish in the early morning, with a sharp decline. The market closed with a rebound due to excessive price drops and production prices being unreasonably low. Retailers replenished their stocks, and the market recovered. As a result, it was stronger than yesterday. Soybean cake sales were sluggish in rural areas, with some inquiries from Taiwan, and the market remained firm. The peak season for fertilizer sales is yet to come.</p>
<p>According to Director Wang of the Ministry of Food, this year's harvest is guaranteed, with the exception of Sichuan. The autumn harvest in the Yangtze River region could reach over 80%, the highest in 30 years. New grain has already entered the market in Guangzhou and other places, and grain prices have generally fallen across the country, with Chongqing being the lowest. Superior glutinous mountain rice is only 16,000 yuan per old peck.</p>
<p>Zhejiang is expected to have a bumper harvest this year, and rice prices have recently fallen from 45,000 yuan to 34,000 yuan. New rice from Zhuji is being sold at 25,000 yuan per stone. It is said that the rice produced in the counties along the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway is not only abundant but also has firm grains, due to the even rainfall and suitable temperature.</p>

<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] It is reported that the Executive Yuan will not consider the proposal to resume the export of cotton yarn and cloth for the time being. It is estimated that the production of various factories under the China Textile Construction Corporation and various private yarn mills is still insufficient to meet the demand in the domestic market. Promoting exports at this time would not be a wise move.</p>

It is said that 50-60 commodities will be affected by this order. It is still unclear whether the restriction will be based on price or quantity, but the former seems more likely.</p>

<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The Shanghai Stock Exchange Preparatory Committee held its seventh preparatory committee meeting at 3:00 PM yesterday in the stock exchange conference room. All committee members attended, chaired by Du Yong. The broker review subcommittee first reported in detail on the preliminary sorting of over 100 applications from corporate brokers and over 300 applications from individual brokers. It was decided that all applications would be returned to the review subcommittee for a second, careful review. It is said that special attention will be paid to the qualifications and reputation of each applicant. It is expected that this review work will be completed within a week, and then submitted to the eighth full preparatory committee for formal selection, and submitted to the ministry for approval and issuance of broker licenses.</p>
<p>Applications for listed securities have recently been decided to be initially sorted by the listed securities review subcommittee starting on the 10th of this month. More than 100 applications have been obtained, but only more than 20 have been completed and submitted. It is said that this concerns the rights and interests of each factory and company, so applications should be completed and submitted as soon as possible so that they can be collected and reviewed on schedule.</p>
<p>The city's insurance industry association sent a letter to the Stock Exchange Preparatory Committee providing its opinion, believing that the regulations on corporate brokers in the provisional fire insurance rules for the stock exchange should add insurance companies in addition to banks, money shops, trust companies, investment or enterprise companies, and securities companies.

Therefore, the Stock Exchange Preparatory Committee has now decided to file this opinion for future discussion pending instructions from the ministry.</p>

<h3 id="e119">Snippets from Mount Lu <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent Xie Baozhu, Our Newspaper, Guling Aviation News</p>
<p>The daughter of the French ambassador went down the mountain to Beijing on the 28th. Madame Chiang Kai-shek specially gifted her two exquisite porcelain rice bowls as a souvenir. These two rice bowls are very beautiful, with red carved dragons on the outside and white porcelain on the inside.</p>
<p>On Sunday morning, there was heavy rain, and Madame Chiang Kai-shek and Marshal Ma and his wife bought rain gear to go to church for worship. The political department specially sent a photographer to capture the scene.</p>
<p>In addition to the part of Marshal Ma's attendants who went up the mountain, there are still many others in the official residence at No. 5 Ninghai Road in Nanjing. Some people go up the mountain to escape the heat, and some people stay behind to endure the heat, which seems unfair, so a rotation system is adopted, with shifts to the mountain.</p>
<p>Mount Lu is a small place, and the main street is less than half a kilometer long. It's always the same few people coming and going. Apart from the summer camp students, one often sees those wearing yellow khaki Zhongshan suits wandering the streets, and one can tell at a glance that they are the chairman's attendants.</p>
<p>Huang Renlin, the director-general of the Lixing Society, is known for "entertaining experts." Director-General Huang is a genius. Wherever he goes, the Lixing Society is exceptionally thorough and wonderful in its arrangements, equipment, and hospitality. Whenever Marshal Ma and Ambassador Stuart go up or down the mountain, he is there to greet them, but Huang is broad in mind and stout in body, and those around him feel sorry for him. The sedan chair requires sixteen people to carry him, and the bearers complain: "I would rather have eight people carry a widow than sixteen people carry him."</p>
<p>The walking stick business on the street is quite good, with each stick priced at 200 yuan. On the day Luo Jialun climbed the mountain, he bought four sticks and gave them to Zheng Yanfen, Liang Hancao, and Gu Zhengding.</p>
<p>The climate on Mount Lu is very different from that at the foot of the mountain, and there are many people suffering from colds and fever, especially when going up and down the mountain, with the sudden changes in temperature. It is not easy for those who are not in good health to cope.</p>
<p>Important people who climb the mountain dare not stay at the "Hu Jin Fang" Hotel, because they all know that the hotel is known as a press conference, to avoid "trouble."</p>
<h3 id="e120">The Scenery of Chicago's Lakefront <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>— Special Dispatch from Chicago, dated the 20th of this month. Correspondent: Mao Shuqing</p>
<p>Chicago, the heart of America, is a distribution center for agricultural and industrial products. This metropolis of 3.5 million people stands on the shore of Lake Michigan. Though it is already mid-summer, Chicago remains chillingly cold. The day I left New York, friends all said, "No need to bring a coat," but upon arriving in Chicago, I was so frozen my nose dripped. On the tram, an American old man stared at me, and after a long silence, said, "Young Chinese friend, don't you have a coat? Though mine is torn, I can take it off and give it to you!" I was extremely embarrassed and explained with some effort: I did have a coat, but I had left it in New York! "I am young, this little bit of cold is nothing," I said.</p>
<p>Center of the Steel Industry</p>
<p>I left New York on a hot afternoon and arrived at Chicago's "LaSalle" station the next morning. The train took a full sixteen hours, crossing one-third of the United States from east to west. This area is the most densely populated and the richest region in the United States. Americans usually refer to the states of Ohio, Illinois, and Indiana as the "Midwest." In reality, spreading out a map of the United States, these states should all be called the East, or Midwest. The reason it has a "West" in its name is because it was named during the westward expansion movement of the 19th century, just as we call Shaanxi "Northwest." Lanzhou is the center of mainland China; Shaanxi is not only not Northwest, but actually East!</p>
<p>Many similar situations can be found in the geography of China and the United States. Chicago is undoubtedly like Wuhan in China. Wuhan is the center of China's water and land transportation, and so is Chicago. Wuhan is the center of China's coal and iron industry, and so is Chicago. In Chicago, opening your eyes, you do not see the skyscrapers of New York, the magnificent splendor of New York, nor the serene elegance of Washington. Although Chicago also has wide roads and green willows along both sides, my impression, no, any tourist's impression of Chicago, is of darkness. Not only are the colors of Chicago's buildings dark, but the elevated trains towering in the center of the roads are all made of dark steel frameworks. One day, I took a tram from the bustling city to 63rd Street to visit a friend. Just as I got off the tram, a gust of coal smoke rushed into my nose. The number of smokestacks in Chicago is absolutely unseen in New York and Washington. The total mileage of railway tracks in Chicago is more than all the railways in New England combined.</p>
<p>Of course, the center of the steel industry should first be Pittsburg (Pennsylvania). During the Civil War, President Lincoln's two biggest supports were Pittsburg and Chicago. This time, traveling west from New York, I bought a "Pullman" ticket. The train traveled along the Hudson River, up to Albany, the capital of New York State, then west along Lake Erie, through a corner of Pennsylvania, into Ohio, and then across Indiana to Chicago. This line is also called the "Horizontal Railroad." When it was built, it was constructed along rivers and lakes, avoiding the eastern hills of Pennsylvania and Virginia, so it did not pass through Pittsburg. Although it took a slightly longer route, it was still economically sound because it traveled faster.</p>
<p>Pullman Train</p>
<p>The "Pullman" train is considered one of the most popular among Americans. Not only does it travel fast and with less vibration, but the seats are also more comfortable. Passengers who are unwilling to spend a lot of money on "sleeper" tickets buy a "Pullman" seat ticket, and at night, turning the seat down can produce an effect quite close to a sleeper car. Therefore, whenever a "Pullman" train departs, reservations often have to be made in person a week in advance. The line for reservations is terribly long, sometimes requiring standing for an hour or two, but many people would rather wait than take another train. In a capitalist society, everything is privately run, and private enterprises create competition in service.</p>
<p>In New York, many Chinese friends were not used to the climate of New York. After arriving in Chicago, I felt that Chicago's climate was even worse. Chicago is humid, and when it is hot, the humidity is so intense that it makes your whole body feel greasy. Also, because it is near the lake, the climate changes easily, and there are many rainy days. I arrived in Chicago at eight in the morning, and by one or two in the afternoon, I was sweating all over. Friends invited me to go boating in Jackson Park. We rowed from the small river in Jackson Park to the shore of Lake Michigan. Suddenly, dark clouds gathered, thunder rumbled, and lightning flashed, followed by a downpour. Although the boat did not capsize, several of us were drenched like chickens. That very night, the weather turned strangely cold, and the next day, the residents of Chicago all put on their black overcoats.</p>
<p>Americans or foreigners who are used to living in Chicago know to bring a raincoat when they go out, and many older people carry an umbrella. Generally speaking, Americans in Chicago are more simple and unpretentious than those in New York. If New York symbolizes a world-consuming city, Chicago symbolizes a producing city. In New York's Times Square, the crowds coming and going, though also in a hurry, are mostly pursuing pleasure and seeking consumption. Chicago is not like that. The crowds coming and going on the streets of Chicago all seem to be related to the city's ten thousand factories. On the streets of Chicago, large and small factories are marked with signs, and there are also explanations saying "Welcome to Visit." Large enterprises, such as slaughterhouses, newspapers, printing factories, and printing machine manufacturers, all have special staff to receive visitors. They explain each department and door, increasing the knowledge of the visitors and advertising their factories. Many rural Americans, old ladies, and children, once they have the opportunity to go to Chicago, are determined not to give up these opportunities to seek urban knowledge.</p>
<p>The foreigners in Chicago are not as diverse as in New York. The most numerous are the Japanese, but there are only six or seven thousand of them. They run small businesses, and you can often see them on the streets. During the war, they had no freedom. There are more than three thousand overseas Chinese, and like overseas Chinese everywhere, they form their own district. They created the universally consistent "Chinatown." Chicago's Chinatown is near 22nd Street, less than a mile from the most prosperous downtown area. In Chinatown, there is a standing Chinese palace-style building: "On Leong Chinese Merchants Association," which is much more magnificent than New York's Chinatown. It is said that this building was built during the period of American economic recession, costing $500,000, and is now valued at least at $2 million.</p>
<p>Current Living Conditions of Overseas Chinese</p>
<p>Like other places, overseas Chinese open restaurants and laundries, attracting a large number of American diners with non-Chinese "chop suey" and "chow mein." Machine laundry easily damages clothes, and Americans most admire the "hand laundry" of overseas Chinese laundries. These overseas Chinese, who started with nothing, are the basic cadres of the On Leong Chinese Merchants Association in Chicago. They work diligently, but ultimately lack knowledge. Consul General Chen Changle talked to me about the lives of the overseas Chinese with both excitement and sadness: "They can make money, but after they make money, they gamble. Gambling has become their most important leisure activity, becoming an almost impossible habit to break."</p>
<p>I did not have time to visit the actual situation of the overseas Chinese gambling. I heard a little from several overseas Chinese intellectual youths. Too few overseas Chinese children receive higher education. Many boys, after graduating from middle school, take up jobs as waiters in restaurants, because these jobs earn more money, even more than university graduates.</p>
<p>Of course, there are also overseas Chinese youths who are studying at universities. There are several at the University of Chicago. The University of Chicago is considered one of the best and strictest schools in the United States, along with Harvard and Yale. There are dozens of Chinese students, most of whom come from China. President Robert Maynard Hutchins of the University of Chicago is an educational philosopher. Since the end of World War II, he has consistently advocated "world government," echoing the views of the great scientist Albert Einstein. Students at the University of Chicago, from who knows where, all believe that their president will participate in the 1948 presidential election.</p>
<p>Diverse Universities</p>
<p>In fact, the University of Chicago has not only contributed to the war, but its academic cultivation also has a profound foundation. Oskar Lange, the Polish representative to the United Nations Security Council, one of the world's leading economists, had long obtained American citizenship and lectured at the University of Chicago before he entered politics. The students of the University of Chicago still miss Lange's abandonment of his academic career. The University of Chicago made the greatest contribution to American scholars' research on the atomic bomb. To this day, the gymnasium behind the University of Chicago is still tightly locked with iron gates, "No Entry," because this gymnasium is related to the structure of the atomic bomb. It is also said that the American military still maintains very close contact with several physics professors at the University of Chicago. Mr. Yang Zhenning, a Chinese government-sponsored student studying in the United States, assisted professors in research on atomic theory and was recognized as a promising genius.</p>
<p>The University of Chicago does not have much research and discussion on Chinese issues. It is said that there is a professor named McNair, who specializes in Far Eastern issues. In a lecture on the future of China, he said: After China abolishes extraterritoriality, it will strongly tend towards narrow nationalism. He also said that the Hong Kong issue will inevitably become the focus of the Chinese people's closest attention. He said a lot, all of which were "completely irrelevant," and I don't know where he got his "boundless empty theories" from his research in books.</p>
<p>The most incomprehensible thing for me is that the students of the University of Chicago, regardless of their nationality, all unanimously hate the "Chicago Tribune." This situation was absolutely unimaginable to me before I arrived in Chicago. They said that the Tribune's rhetoric is backward, and the Tribune is a inexplicably outdated newspaper.</p>
<p>The Beautiful Lake Michigan</p>
<p>Originally, I planned to visit the "Tribune" as soon as I arrived in Chicago, because, in any case, it is the newspaper with the most circulation in the history of American journalism. Chicagoans say that the situation has changed now, "Don't you believe it? Look at the Daily News and the Sun, they are so much better."</p>
<p>Another changed phenomenon is that New York newspapers have replaced the golden age of Chicago news in history. Now, Americans in Chicago subscribe to the New York Times, the New York Daily News, or the New York Evening Post. Once, on a lakeside train, I saw an elderly American reading the New York Times. I asked him if he lived in Chicago. He said, "Yes." He said, "Chicagoans reading Chicago newspapers is like drinking a glass of cold water. Reading New York newspapers is like drinking a cup of coffee or strong tea." He asked me if I agreed with him, and I nodded slightly.</p>
<p>The lakeside train stops at the intersection of Randolph Street. Between the train tracks and the lake shore, there is also a wide road, with fragrant grass like a carpet and lush greenery, reflecting the lake scenery of Lake Michigan. This lakeside road is the essence of Chicago and the only embellishment of this dark industrial city. I got off at Randolph Street Station, crossed Michigan Avenue, and returned to the world's largest hotel where I was staying—the Stevens Hotel. After a day of fatigue, leaning against the window sill facing the lake, looking at the rippling blue waters of the lake, there is an unspeakable sense of comfort and relaxation.</p>

<h3 id="e121">Further Notes on Visiting the TVA <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>— Special Dispatch from this Newspaper, dated the 16th of this Month, by Correspondent Mao Shuqing</p>
<p>I never managed to visit the atomic bomb manufacturing site. I discussed it several times with Judge Berch of Belgium, wondering whether or not to make a verbal "request." After thinking it over, I always felt that I couldn't bring myself to say it. Even if they allowed it, they would only show us a few buildings. We are not specialists, "Why go looking for trouble?"</p>
<p>There is a lead manufacturing factory near the Fontana Dam, perhaps also due to the convenience of electricity. On the way to the Fontana Dam, we passed a steep cliff, a ten-thousand-foot mountain, with a clear green stream flowing deep inside, like a natural bridge in western Hubei. From there, we could see a small dam in the distance, the Calderwood Dam, also one of the twenty-six, but without a power plant, etc.</p>
<p>The Fontana Dam began construction on January 1, 1942, immediately following the Pearl Harbor incident, a masterpiece of President Roosevelt. It was completed on January 20 of last year, with the project taking exactly three years. Currently, in addition to the dam's power generation room, several pools and viewing rooms are being added, etc. An engineer on the dam, John Monahan, led us on a tour of the various locations. He said that before the completion of the Fontana Dam, there were 5,000 workers working here; now, only 400 people remain. He pointed to the cable suspension bridge erected between two mountains next to the dam, used to transport materials and steam locomotives during construction. He said that after the Fontana Dam was built, a large artificial lake was formed behind the dam. The water source flows from the mountain slopes into the lake, with 35 miles of still water. These 35 miles of natural power are all concentrated on the generators.</p>
<p>The artificial lake is 400 feet deep. John Monahan said that when everything is set up in the future, yachts can be arranged for people to fish. He said that the viewing room can be built in about nine months. I saw rumbling heavy trucks still transporting stone materials, and the dam still had a working atmosphere.</p>
<p>John Monahan took us to the newly arranged market behind, which is a new village in the mountains, called Welches. It is separated from the dam by a mountain. The new village is on the back of the mountain. Now, because the highway is open, coming and going is very convenient. In the new village, there are schools, shops, restaurants, and many "mobile homes," which were originally inhabited by staff and workers. Now that the engineering personnel have left, the government of North Carolina is renting them to tourists. Many Americans who visit the TVA bring their wives and stay here for a week, with rent as high as $40 or even $84 per week.</p>
<p>The existing dam staff all live in the new village. The mountain valleys are better than the city in summer. They work in this paradise and also enjoy the beautiful scenery of this paradise.</p>
<p>Norris Dam</p>
<p>The same situation is the same at the Norris Dam. Norris is 25 miles north of Knoxville. The new village of Norris is more beautiful than Fontana. Many people have moved to Norris specifically to live. They fish, swim, and boat here, enjoying their paradise-like life.</p>
<p>The Norris Dam was one of the first to be started after the TVA was established in 1933, beginning on October 1, 1933, and completed on July 28, 1936. The total cost was about 30 million yuan. The dam is 265 feet high and 1,860 feet long, much smaller than Fontana. The reason for using the name Norris is to commemorate Senator Norris, the father of the TVA. (I will introduce Senator Norris in another article)</p>
<p>The appearance of the Norris Dam is also different from the Fontana Dam. Fontana is located between two mountains, with the dam built on the front and the power plant in the middle of the dam. The Norris Dam is built between two hills, with the power plant on one side of the bank. Cars can also pass over the dam, and a large American flag is flying on the dam.</p>
<p>The Norris Dam has been fully completed. The material of the dam is also steel-reinforced concrete. There is an active iron gate under the dam. When the water level rises during the rainy season, the gate can be opened to allow excess water to flow out freely. Many of the stones used to build the dam were obtained nearby. One side of a stone mountain next to the dam was half-mined.</p>
<p>The power generation of the Norris power plant is also relatively small. The viewing platform has been fully constructed. The artificial lake behind is more beautiful than Fontana. Many tourists have already set out, and young men and women are swimming there. Behind Lake Norris is Norris Park, which has many trees and simple cabins. Many people spend the summer here, and there are also newlyweds on their honeymoon here. Mr. Coleby, a TVA employee who accompanied me on the visit, told me that there is an even clearer place eight miles upstream, where there are beautiful girls who often swim and sing in the summer. Sometimes, they lie by the river to sunbathe, and sometimes, they dance in the lush moonlit nights.</p>
<p>Coleby said: Norris is now not only a paradise for Tennesseans, but also a paradise for many American veterans. After fighting the war, they became government employees and settled with their happy families in this small village in paradise.</p>
<p>The small village has parks, post offices, various convenient transportation facilities, and an inexhaustible supply of electricity, as well as electric lights, electric fans, and running water powered by electricity. The small village now has a Water Resources Administration, a municipal government, and a public assembly hall. Each small family has their own garden, lawn, and vegetable and tomato gardens.</p>
<p>"But," Coleby couldn't help but sigh: "What kind of world was this thirteen years ago?" He said that he had been working here since the second year of the TVA's creation. He served in the military for four years in between, going on expeditions overseas. He had seen the TVA sprout and grow leaves. When he returned from overseas last year, he saw that this great undertaking had blossomed and even borne fruit! (Knoxville, July 16)</p>
<h3 id="e122">Two or Three Things About Tibet <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>— Special Dispatch from Peiping, dated the 30th of this Month, by Correspondent Zhang Jianmei</p>
<p>"Political News of Tibet" relates recent news about Tibet as follows: Since Reting Hutuktu resigned, Tibet has been under the regency of the Dalai Lama. The Dalai Lama is only fourteen years old this year and cannot yet govern. The old Panchen Lama died of illness in Qinghai on the way back to Tibet. After his reincarnation, the new Panchen Lama's Zunzu has each found a reincarnation in Xikang and Qinghai. Luosang Jianzan, the attendant of the old Panchen Lama, also found a reincarnation in Xunhua, Qinghai, named Guanbao Cidan, who has already been enthroned at the Kumbum Monastery in Qinghai. The Tibetan side plans to take the two reincarnations to Tibet and then hold formal procedures to determine which one should inherit the Panchen. The reason why the central government has not yet given the official title to Guanbao Cidan, the reincarnation of Kumbum Monastery, is because he has not completed the procedures. In Lhasa, the central government agencies now have an office of the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission, a transportation radio station, and a national primary school of the Ministry of Education. Since Shen Zongkang succeeded Kong Qingzong as director of the office in 1944, the relationship between Tibet and the central government has been extremely harmonious. The fact that the Tibetan National Assembly representatives arrived in Beijing before the representatives from various regions is an indication of Tibet's inclination towards the interior. After the Yunnan-Burma Road was cut off, Kang and Tibetan people once organized the Kang-Tibetan Transportation Company, using yaks and horses to transport materials from India over the Himalayas. After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, this difficult transportation has ended. Although the Sixth Plenary Session had a resolution allowing Tibet a high degree of autonomy, the Ministry of Interior also convened relevant ministries to discuss this, but due to the ongoing domestic turmoil, this matter has not yet been finalized. Shen Zonglian suffers from heart disease and is not well-suited to the high altitude climate of Lhasa. This time, accompanying the Tibetan National Assembly representatives to Beijing, he has quite a bit of desire to retire, but the central government is currently trying to retain him. After Xirao Jiacuo was blocked from entering Tibet last year, he is now in his original residence in Qinghai.</p>

<p>Dear Editor: The postal service's remittance fees have always been regulated. In the previous month, it only cost 30 yuan per ten thousand yuan remitted to Jiangdu County in northern Jiangsu, but this month, it suddenly soared to 1,500 yuan per ten thousand yuan, an increase of fiftyfold! This is truly shocking! For example, I am just a basic small clerk, earning a meager salary of 100,000 yuan per month, and I have to send it home to support my family's livelihood. First, the post office strips off 15%, which is truly miserable for us small clerks! I am writing to your newspaper to appeal to the postal authorities! (Huang Gong)</p>

<p>To the Editor: Three months ago, the Changshu County Government arrested over thirty opium smugglers, but cannot process their cases because the current county magistrate no longer concurrently manages military law. Furthermore, the court has not received orders from higher authorities to handle opium cases. In this situation where neither party is willing to accept the cases, the thirty-odd opium smugglers are being shuffled back and forth with no resolution. I believe that when the government handles cases, there should always be a receiving agency. Although there may be changes in the jurisdiction of agencies, these changes should be seamless in terms of timing. Otherwise, as in the situation described above, wouldn't it be a case of "neither heaven nor earth caring?" (Gan Han)</p>

<p>To the Editor: During the recent war, Binshan fell first, resulting in countless deaths and losses. Under the enemy's tyrannical power, they forcibly seized farmland to build airfields, driving residents away. The pitiful people, supporting the old and leading the young, fled to other places, suffering from hunger and cold, collapsing by the roadside, and being raped and slaughtered by the brutal enemy—a scene too tragic to bear witness to! Last autumn, our country was victorious, and the Japanese surrendered. The government took over the airfield long ago, but it has been almost a year now, and the national government has not inquired about the plight of the poor disaster victims. These people are also citizens of the Republic of China, and the government should provide relief. They have suffered eight years of hardship and should receive some comfort in terms of food, clothing, and shelter. Then, a thorough investigation of land ownership should be conducted, returning land to those who can farm it, and compensating those who cannot farm it at market prices. We, the thousand-plus disaster victims of Wangbang, have seen enemy and puppet property being seized and relief supplies arriving, but we have always remained silent. Sadly, no one has paid us any attention! We dare to ask your newspaper to represent the thousand-plus disaster victims of Wangbang and appeal to the authorities not to forget this group of pitiful people. (Wu Rende, Yuepu Town, Baoshan)</p>
<h3 id="e127">Letter from Feng, Township Head of Jinshan <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>To the Editor: I recently saw in your newspaper's "Reader's Opinions" column on July 26th an article titled "Such a Township Head," purportedly written by a resident of Chashan Township in the Jinjie District of Jinshan County. It stated that "his relatives have repeatedly been framed by the township head using his henchmen, and he requests the authorities to uphold justice and conduct a thorough investigation." However, it was unclear whether the township head referred to was the head of Chashan Township or another township. As the head of Chashan Township, I must make a statement. I have been in office as the head of Chashan Township since December 13th of last year, which is now eight months. In these eight months, I am confident that I have not done anything inappropriate. The letter mentioned "accusing his relatives of being detained and extorted by roaming bandits and disbanded soldiers." This may have happened in other townships, but it has definitely not happened in Chashan Township. Since I took office as township head, I have never dealt with any roaming bandits or disbanded soldiers. As for "detention and extortion," how could that be possible? Furthermore, the township office does not have detention facilities. The claims of "losing over twenty dan of rice" and "the original plaintiff also losing over thirty dan of rice" are unclear as to who suffered the loss. Finally, the statement "fearing exposure and further framing, he was detained again" is unclear as to what it refers to. After investigation, our township has a total of six bao (neighborhoods), with a population of about five hundred households. Although I cannot say that everyone is law-abiding, no one has been imprisoned or detained for committing a crime. Therefore, what the contributor said has no factual basis. Because the letter was signed as a resident of Chashan Township, I fear that distant rumors are inaccurate. I hope you will publish this letter as a correction. (Feng Shuliu, Township Head of Chashan Township, Jinwei District, Jinshan County)</p>

<h3 id="e128">Three Xiang and Seven Ze Swamped with Famine - Wheat Flour Enters Rich Homes and Flows into the Black Market <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>— Report from Changsha, 21st — Huang Chao Ru</p>
<p>Changsha, which has undergone one fire and four battles, has only the remnants of broken walls and overgrown weeds left from its pre-war prosperity, fully demonstrating its desolation, depression, and poverty. Old Changsha residents speak of the Changsha of the past with a "white-haired palace maid" air. Indeed, today's Changsha is unrecognizable. Although the shops on the main streets have ostensibly reopened, the reality is that behind the shops is a desolate scene, with weeds growing above the knees. Being in it will make you doubt that it is in the wild mountains and graves. Although some shops are decorated luxuriously, the inventory in the counters will never be full. The universal struggle is to be outwardly lively while inwardly suffering, like a woman who has lost her youth, no matter how much powder and rouge she puts on her face, she still can't hide her haggard face.</p>
<p>The Land of Fish and Rice is Plagued by Famine</p>
<p>Changsha's desolation and depression are primarily due to the fires of war. However, cities that fell during the war have gradually moved towards recovery and prosperity after liberation. Why does Changsha still present such a bleak situation? There is another main reason for this, and that is that Hunan Province is experiencing an unprecedented famine this year. With the entire province trapped in famine, how can one hope that this agricultural city will recover its prosperity?</p>
<p>Speaking of famine, in scientifically backward China, everything is conquered by nature, and almost every year, there are one or two places suffering from famine, so it is not a strange thing. However, Hunan is the land of fish and rice, the Three Xiang and Seven Ze, and the Chinese people have always regarded it as the granary of Central China. Not only can it be self-sufficient, but it also has surplus grain to supply neighboring provinces. There was originally the saying that "when Huguang is rich, the whole country is fed." During the Anti-Japanese War, the southeastern half of the rice-producing area fell into enemy hands, and Hunan played a huge role in supplying food to the anti-Japanese army and civilians, earning the honor of being the "anti-Japanese warehouse." However, in today's post-war era, this land of fish and rice is plagued by famine, which is truly surprising.</p>
<p>Relief Officials Register by Township and Bao</p>
<p>The cause of the Hunan famine, in addition to the impact of the summer drought, is mainly the war. Because of the disaster, the people fled together and were displaced to other places, leaving their fields to be deserted. Especially in the mountainous areas of southern Hunan, rice production is not as abundant as in eastern Hunan, Hubei, and the lakeside areas. In addition, because of the abandonment of farmland, there will naturally be a grain shortage. Of Hunan's 30 million people, half, 15 million, are starving people without food. From this spring to the present, in Hengyang and Lingling in southern Hunan, tree bark and grass roots have been eaten, and people have starved to death. In some places, there are more than 20 people per bao. The Relief and Rehabilitation Administration has been paying close attention to this matter in order to relieve the Hunan disaster. At first, porridge distribution centers were set up in places where disaster victims gathered in large numbers. Later, it was felt that it was difficult for porridge distribution centers to reach the vast rural areas, and there was a trend of too many monks and too little porridge. Therefore, it was changed to emergency relief, and batches of relief officials were sent out, carrying wheat flour, and distributing relief according to registration by township and bao. This good policy can be expected to make relief universal and prevent disaster victims from traveling long distances to eat porridge and leaving their hometowns. However, there were also many unpleasant incidents at the same time, namely:</p>
<p>Starving People in Changsha are Skin and Bones</p>
<p>(1) The distribution of wheat flour relies on the township and bao chiefs because of the limited manpower of the relief agencies. Among the township and bao chiefs, there are indeed those who are honest and law-abiding, but there are also those who are unscrupulous and commit crimes. Therefore, even though the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration is "unable to live without relief," wheat flour still enters the homes of the rich and flows into the black market. Those disaster victims who are fortunate enough to receive some relief items have the feeling that they have received a pound of flour today and will not receive a second time until the year of the monkey. It is not as beneficial as having porridge twice a day. Due to the implementation of "emergency relief," the porridge distribution centers have stopped. Those disaster victims who are unable to return home or whose relief items received in their hometowns are insufficient still wander in the cities and live by begging. Not to mention other counties and cities, just looking at Changsha City, starving people who are skin and bones can be seen everywhere on the sidewalks. Some are on the verge of death, and some have starved to death on the roadside or in the rubble and grass. After a day or two, they are wrapped in straw mats and moved to be buried in the suburbs. This is truly a great irony for the relief work.</p>
<p>Three Thousand Tons of Flour Stockpiled in Changsha and Not Transported</p>
<p>(2) The disaster victims are pitiful and scattered everywhere. They do not know the source of the wheat flour. They are naturally fortunate to receive wheat flour, and they will naturally not ask for it if it is not distributed. The staff of the relief agencies, when distributing porridge, did not dare not put the wheat and rice into the pot on time because the disaster victims gathered together, which easily caused trouble. After the change to "emergency relief," they were happy to handle it calmly. Therefore, although the name is "emergency," it is actually "slow." Thus, ten days ago, there was a phenomenon of three thousand tons of wheat flour being stockpiled and not transported in Laodaohe, Changsha. The total amount of wheat flour distributed to Hunan by the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration is only one thousand tons per month, but three thousand tons are stockpiled in Changsha and not transported to the disaster areas, which is really puzzling. Fortunately, the "Hunan Disaster Emergency Relief Association," organized by local impartial gentry, found out about the matter and held an emergency meeting at Chairman Wang's official residence, and only then were the three thousand tons of wheat flour gradually transported out.</p>
<p>Autumn Harvest is Hopeful, Disaster Relief Cannot Be Relaxed</p>
<p>Regarding disaster relief in Hunan, some say that it is coming to an end because the new grain is approaching the time of harvest. The rainfall is still favorable this year, and the famine in Hunan will naturally be eliminated after the autumn harvest. This observation is roughly 90% or more true, so everyone thinks that the disaster relief in Hunan can be brought to an end after one or two months of effort. In fact, this view is too optimistic. This kind of optimism will give people more painful disappointment. For example, during the Anti-Japanese War, everyone thought that everything would be swept away as long as there was victory. Therefore, there was no plan for post-victory recovery at all. Who knew that the hardships after recovery were even worse than during the war. Those who are optimistic that Hunan will be in good shape after the autumn harvest will certainly fall into this bitter situation.</p>
<p>Now, let's first talk about the recovery of rice harvests in Hunan Province. In normal years of bumper harvests, the figures announced by the government are 121.6 million hectoliters, while consumption is 115.94 million hectoliters. Adding miscellaneous grains, the surplus rice in Hunan Province will not exceed 4.5 million shi.</p>
<p>This Autumn Harvest is at Most Only 70%</p>
<p>Although the rainfall in Hunan Province is favorable this year, the harvest will definitely not be full. First, there is too much wasteland in the recovered areas that could not be replanted in time. Second, the rainfall in early spring was unfavorable, and spring plowing was delayed. Land that could be harvested twice a year will have at most only the hope of harvesting once this year. Third, there is a general lack of plowing cattle, fertilizer, seeds, and other plowing resources everywhere, and there is no ability to increase production. Fourth, many strong men have been conscripted and killed in battle, or have not yet been demobilized, reducing the number of people plowing. Fifth, the disaster victims who are desperate for food are so widespread that it is difficult to save the dying, and they can only let the fields be abandoned. Sixth, the rural economy has collapsed, and many farmers have abandoned agriculture to switch to other industries, further reducing the ability to cultivate. Based on this estimate, there will be at most only a 70% harvest this year. However, the period of the western flood has not yet passed, and the water level in Shashi has exceeded the highest record of previous years. The fords in Gong'an and Shishou have already had water flowing back into the lake, and the embankments around the lake are in imminent danger. If there is an accident, the harvest is still not guaranteed.</p>
<p>The Fundamental Plan is to Quickly Resume Plowing and Reclaim Wasteland</p>
<p>Even if heaven grants our wishes and we can have a full harvest of 70%, then it will only be enough for consumption in the province. If a part is exported to offset the economy of goods imported from outside the province, then there will still inevitably be starving people. Furthermore, a bumper harvest is reaped by the landlords, and the starving people mostly belong to the tenant farmer class. Now, the practice of buying green grain is prevalent everywhere. One stone is borrowed, and two to four stones of grain are repaid after the autumn harvest. Looking forward to the harvest, they are all exploited. If there is another "cheap grain hurts farmers," then there is no need to say more. In this situation, who can guarantee that there will be no disaster victims in Hunan after the autumn harvest!</p>
<p>Based on the above views, we believe that the disaster in Hunan is just beginning to surge. In order to achieve the goal of eliminating the Xiang disaster, we cannot but hope that the wise provincial authorities will make a far-reaching fundamental plan. Quickly find ways to resume plowing and reclaim wasteland; actively manage the Yuan and Zi rivers; agricultural loans should simplify procedures and actually reach the hands of farmers. Finally, the 25% rent reduction should be implemented earnestly and quickly in Hunan. If this can be done, then there is hope that the disaster in Hunan will be eliminated by next year.</p>
<h3 id="e129">Dispute Between France and Siam <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>— Gao Shiheng</p>
<p>Recently, since France has re-entered Vietnam, it has used the excuse of searching for rebels to invade the Siamese border. Siam also refuses to give in and rises up to resist, while appealing to the United Nations Security Council. In recent developments, France has clearly expressed its intention to reclaim the land it demanded from Siam in 1941, with the additional condition of demanding that Siam hand over a statue of the Emerald Buddha obtained from Lang Prabang in 1778. Although the world is at peace, the earth is still full of the smell of gunpowder. The dispute between France and Siam is an Asian affair. Unfortunately, we are unable to care for ourselves, and we cannot take care of it. The Chinese people are relatively unfamiliar with this issue, so I have written this article to resonate.</p>
<p>We must first understand that although the history of Siam's establishment is only over six hundred years, it is a small country. Before the Pacific War, it was the only completely independent and autonomous country in Asia. Siam was called Thailand before the war and renamed Siam after the war. The Thai people initially established the Nanzhao Kingdom in Dali, Yunnan, China, and dominated the southwest. In 1254, it was destroyed by the Yuan Dynasty, and the entire tribe moved south, driving out the Khmer people and occupying the current land. According to historical records, it went through the Sukhothai Dynasty, the Ayutthaya Dynasty, the Thonburi Dynasty, and the current Chakri Dynasty that rules Siam. At its peak, its territory included not only the mainland but also western Vietnam and northern Malaya. Since 1824, it has signed commercial treaties with the United Kingdom, which was the prelude to Europeans entering Siam. Since then, diplomacy has been eventful, and the history of the past hundred years has been almost entirely written for Europeans. Since King Rama I of the Chakri Dynasty, it began to lose land, first to Burma, then to Vietnam. Since the influence of Britain and France extended into the Indochina Peninsula, Siam became a battleground for the two countries. Until the last cession of land in 1910, for 113 years, it had only carefully dealt with the land demands of the two countries, especially the frequent demands of France, which made Siam's territory shrink day by day. At the end of the First European War, Siam and Britain and France re-signed treaties to abolish extraterritoriality and become an independent and free country. The changes in Siam's territory over the years are summarized as follows: (1) In 1785, Burma invaded Tenasserim and the three places of Tan Lao and Tavoy and invested them in Burma. (2) In 1791, the vassal state of Shihburi signed a contract with the United Kingdom to lease Penang Island. (3) In 1801, the United Kingdom continued to lease a piece of land opposite Penang Island, which the British called Willsley. (4) In 1805, it ceded Ha Tien (southwest of Saigon) to Vietnam. (5) In 1812, Vietnam extended its power to Cambodia and annexed it, but it was returned to the Siam territory in 1807. (6) In 1828, it ceded Meong Puan to Vietnam. (7) In 1868, it signed a contract with France, and Cambodia was placed under French protection. (8) In 1874, it signed a contract with the United Kingdom, and Preak was ruled by the United Kingdom and became one of the Malay states. (9) In 1887, it ceded Sibsongchvthai and Hvapantanghok to France. (10) In 1889, it ceded the land northwest of the Nu River, Lanna, which is the department of millions of rice fields, to the British. (11) In 1893, France sailed its navy into Bangkok and signed a contract to cede Luangprabang and Viengchan to France. (12) In 1903, it ceded the land on the west bank of the Mekong River and Champasak to France. (13) In 1906, it ceded the eastern territory of the borders of Battamban, Siemrap, and Sisbon to France. (14) In 1909, it ceded Kedah, Kelantan, Tringan, and Perl to the British and incorporated them into Malaya as the reward for the United Kingdom canceling extraterritoriality in Siam.</p>
<p>Therefore, Siam lost land 14 times from 1785 to 1910. According to Siamese historians, Cheli near Yunnan, China, was also once under the jurisdiction of Siam, which is a mistake. After checking, Cheli was pacified by the Yuan Dynasty in 1300, and the Cheli Military and Civilian Chief Executive Office was established. Cheli is also written as Cheli, and this country includes Cheli and Simao. Sometimes it also has its southern border, which is not outside Yunnan Province. (Feng Chengjun's "A Study of Lost Lands in the Western Regions and the South China Sea" translated by Georges Maspero's "Study of the Countries of the Vietnam Peninsula in the Early Song Dynasty") Then Cheli was already under Chinese territory during the Yuan Dynasty. The author hereby makes a statement. (Attached Siamese border map)</p>
<p>Secondly, when the Second World War started, Siam was pursuing nationalism and demanded that France recover the land on the right bank of the Mekong River on the grounds of recovering lost land. France refused the request, and there was a Siam-Vietnam war. At that time, France was sweet in the war and had no time to look east. Japanese forces were extending into Siam and Vietnam, openly claiming to be the masters of Asia, and came out to stop the war. A border demarcation meeting was held in Tokyo, and Siam and the Vichy government of France signed a treaty, dividing the following two places to Siam.</p>
<p>(1) Between 1000 to 1020 degrees east longitude and 1050 to 200 degrees north latitude, that is, the land on the upper reaches of the Mekong River from Ban'Khwak near ChiengKhong in the north to Lvang Prabang in the east and south to Ban Pak Hoeang.</p>
<p>(2) Between 1010 to 1050 degrees east longitude and 1230 to [blank] degrees north latitude. That is, the middle reaches of the Mekong River from near BanPakmvn south through Bassac to the lakeside near Sisobon (excluding Angkorva and the lake), and then down to include Battambang and Moung to the city of Trht near Khaosaming.</p>
<p>When the Pacific War started, Siam was instigated by Japan to assign the four states of Kedah, Kelantan, Tringan, and Perlis to Siam. After Japan surrendered, the above four places were returned to Malaya. Speaking of the Emerald Buddha, it has a close relationship with the Chinese people. This treasure was originally owned by Wiengchan, also known as Vientiane (between 1020 degrees east longitude and 180 degrees north latitude on the right bank of the Mekong River), the lord of Lang Prabang, and it is a treasure of the town, carved from jade. In 1778, a Chinese Siamese king, Zheng Zhao, known in Siamese history as the Thonburi Dynasty, took it from Vientiane, the lord of Lang Prabang. This Chinese king was from Chaozhou. He grew up in Siam and worked in the Ayutthaya court. When foreign enemies invaded, King Zheng was in the army, driving away the enemies, suppressing the lords, and unifying Siam. Therefore, he was supported by the Siamese people as king and officially ascended the throne in 1768. The king was still martial and far-sighted, and the prosperity of national power was a creation in Siamese history. In 1781 (the forty-sixth year of Qianlong), he sent an envoy to China to be recognized as a Chinese vassal. In 1787, a rebellion broke out in Vientiane, a vassal state of Lang Prabang, and its rebel ministers fled to Wubun on the border, and the Marquis of Vientiane crossed the border to capture and kill them. The king believed that it was a violation of the king's power and sent troops to attack it, breaking its capital and obtaining a world-renowned treasure, the Emerald Buddha, which was placed in the Bangkok Palace. From this campaign to the end of 1893, Lang Prabang and Vientiane always depended on Siam.</p>
<p>The above is the cause of the mutual contention between France and Siam for land and jade Buddha. We observe from an objective standpoint that the land disputed by both sides originally belonged to Siam, and it is not without a standpoint for Siam to take it back. France's reason is that the treaty on the cession of land was signed by the Vichy government in 1941 under the pressure of Japan and cannot be recognized, which is also reasonable. It also opposes the intervention of the United Nations and is willing to negotiate directly between the two sides. However, we cannot deny that in the past, France ruled Vietnam, and the general absurd colonial officials treated the natives like cattle and horses, subjecting 20 million Vietnamese people to slave life. After the war, France allowed to raise the status of the colony and made Vietnam a member of the United Nations. We believe that this progressive attitude is beneficial to France. After China surrendered to Japan, it received the area north of 16 degrees north latitude in Vietnam, and Vietnam has a close historical relationship with China. The Chinese people are certainly concerned about this issue, but the way to solve it depends on how both sides develop, or whether the United Nations accepts Siam's application and is subject to the judgment of justice. As for the Jade Buddha, Siam has preserved it for more than a hundred years and is respected by the Siamese people who are devout Buddhists, so France really does not need to take it back, so it is just a minor issue.</p>
<h3 id="e130">Taiwan Miscellany <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>— July 27th Taiwan News from the Sea. Special correspondent: Jiang Muyun.</p>
<p>The staff assigned to Taitung, Penghu, Hualien Port, and the remote mountainous areas are unwilling to take office, posing a major problem for the Provincial Department of Civil Affairs. Not only are the personnel trained by the Department of Civil Affairs and the Police Department unwilling to go, but even the trainees trained by the Accounting Department are unwilling to leave their hometowns.</p>
<p>The person in charge of the Department of Civil Affairs personally felt that this situation was similar to when Chief Chen was in Fujian. After strict restrictions, it slowly disappeared. However, the inconvenience of transportation within the province is a reality, and the situation in Taitung is not comparable to that of other counties. Therefore, two measures have been formulated: (1) Assigned personnel are not allowed to decline or delay their posts; (2) The department will stipulate a system of rotation and mutual transfer. The Accounting Department will send personnel to remote areas and areas that require more accounting personnel to hold recruitment exams, or entrust the local county and city governments to administer the exams on their behalf.</p>
<p>Chen Wei Guan pointed out the reason, saying: During the Japanese occupation, the employer class mostly hired local people, mainly because they considered that small employees could not afford the expenses and travel costs of moving their families. Therefore, they did not transfer employees below the rank of appointed officer, but could transfer those above the rank of recommended officer, but they must be given family relocation expenses.</p>
<p>Cutting Expenses, Implementing Layoffs</p>
<p>Recently, in order to cut expenses, the Taiwan Provincial Government has implemented layoffs in various agencies. The main targets of the layoffs are civil servants who are not maids employed by various agencies and office workers with poor performance.</p>
<p>The Food Bureau laid off 31 people at once, including the Chief Secretary, section chiefs, and employees. Some had even received commendations. These 31 people were dismissed for "inefficient work" by Lin Zhencheng, the Deputy Director of the Bureau, who is acting as the Director. In addition to reporting to the superiors, they also filed lawsuits in court. Wu Changtao, who was assigned as a special commissioner to the Beiping Food Bureau, had to rush back to handle the bureau affairs.</p>
<p>The Police Chief solemnly issued a warning, saying: "It is hoped that various agencies will reduce administrative personnel as much as possible, and the fewer personnel managing factories and warehouses, the better. Because they are familiar with the internal situation, once they are laid off, they are more likely to become thieves, which is more difficult to prevent."</p>
<p>In fact, although there were recent incidents in Taipei such as a robbery of 100,000 Taiwan dollars from an employee of the Monopoly Bureau and a robbery at Miaochun Hospital, public security has clearly returned to normal. However, petty theft is still rampant everywhere, because there were already many unemployed people, and recently, the remnants of the reorganized army and laid-off personnel have been added. They are forced by life and have no choice but to take risks.</p>
<p>Taiwan's Special Products, Urgently Needing Relief</p>
<p>According to Zhao, the director of the Department of Agriculture and Forestry, Taiwan's special products are now in urgent need of relief from the authorities:</p>
<p>Pineapple – In 1940, the annual output was 621,159 boxes. This year, it is expected to reach 10,000 boxes. The Bank of Taiwan has agreed to lend 17 million yuan, which is no longer a problem.</p>
<p>Tea – Last year, more than 2 million catties of tea were in storage and could not be sold, and the cost was stranded. It is planned to be purchased by the Bureau of Foreign Trade, and the previous 60% commodity tax rate has also been reduced to the same as in China.</p>
<p>Bananas – This year's output in Taichung is about 450,000 baskets, totaling 10,000 metric tons that can be sold outside the province, and it is urgent to promote sales outside the province.</p>
<p>Prohibition of Logging – The five-year ban on logging has created two difficulties: one is that the equipment of logging merchants is not utilized, and the merchants suffer losses; the other is that it increases unemployment. The former can utilize equipment to transport wood stored in the mountains, while the latter can initiate work-for-relief programs to allow loggers to engage in forest water management and repair drainage ditches.</p>
<p>Transportation Relations, Greatly Lacking Coordination</p>
<p>Taiwan's transportation has been isolated from the rest of the province for three weeks this month. It has become a veritable isolated island. Fortunately, three Liberty ships have arrived in succession, and the runway at Songshan Airport was repaired on the 19th, and air transportation between Shanghai and Taiwan has been opened up again.</p>
<p>Regarding the airport issue, Commander Zhang of the Air Force District said that the ground equipment of Tainan Airport—dormitories and radio stations—welcomed the China National Aviation Corporation to borrow them, but the China National Aviation Corporation did not borrow them. Instead, it brought its own wireless equipment from Shanghai, which resulted in a considerable delay. Chief Chen said, "How can we succeed if the two sides cannot cooperate?"</p>
<p>The Customs hopes to take over the Keelung and Kaohsiung Port Bureaus, and the Executive Yuan also has an order. The customs warehouses, waterways, and signs belonging to the Customs have long been taken over by the Customs. Currently, the government believes that the ship measurement and inspection matters handled by the Port Bureau are not related to the Customs. Therefore, it has decided on two solutions and will choose one: either telegraph the Ministry of Transportation to bring Taiwan's ports under the unified jurisdiction of the Ministry of Transportation, or wait until the restoration project is completed in one or two years before transferring it to the Customs.</p>
<p>Chief Chen said: "I hope that all units in the province must maintain close contact and cooperate fully, and do not make the same mistakes!"</p>
<h3 id="e131">Old Case of Traitor Killing His Wife, New Spoken Drama Performed <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>[Special News from Huzhou on the 29th of This Month] The Kai Ming Truth Spoken Drama Troupe in this city has recently adapted the real event of "Traitor Xu Yushun Murdering His First Wife" from Huzhou last year. It is currently collecting relevant materials and will be performed as soon as rehearsals are complete. The actual event is summarized as follows: Xu Yushun, a native of Jiangsu, 35 years old, served as a regular patrol officer in the Wuxi Police Bureau before the war. During the Anti-Japanese War, he joined the Wuxi Regional Headquarters of the Puppet Jiangsu-Zhejiang-Anhui Pacification Army, serving as an adjutant. In the summer of 1939, the unit was transferred to Huzhou and reorganized into the Puppet Army 5th Division. Xu was promoted to lieutenant colonel regiment adjutant, and his prestige was greatly enhanced. Ah Mao, the daughter of a Shen from the Telephone Bureau, found him young and handsome and took her as a concubine, forcibly occupying No. 5 Aishan Street as a love nest. Later, Xu committed many evils and was discovered by Cheng Wan-jun, who ordered his dismissal. In June of the first half of the year, Ah Mao incited Xu to have a murderous intention towards his wife. One night, he summoned his wife home to burn opium for her (Xu had a deep addiction). His wife, Wu Yinghua, believed him and went to Xu's residence. Xu then tricked her to the well and instructed his younger brother to strangle his wife with a rope. He guarded the body until midnight and moved it to a mulberry field near Guanghua Bridge, where he dug a hole and buried it, intending to destroy the evidence. The next day, the body was exposed. Cheng Hao, the director of the Puppet Wu and Fan Bureau, a seasoned special agent, investigated in all directions. Within a few days, the case was revealed. The murderer and his brother, as well as his concubine, were arrested and taken to the bureau to await a decision. At that time, news of the Japanese surrender had reached Huzhou, and the relevant authorities were not in the mood to handle the case. However, Cheng Wan-jun, the commander of the Puppet Army 1st Division, deeply hated Xu's inhumanity. After questioning, he tied Xu Yushun and his brother to the execution ground and shot them on the day the Japanese left Huzhou. Xu's concubine was released because the officials of the Puppet Famine Relief Agency fled one after another. The case disappeared without a trace. (Chen Han, Contributor)</p>

<h3 id="e132">Answering Readers, Legal Questions <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>(1) Zhou Jinbao asks: The landlord, surnamed Chen, owns five mu of paddy fields in the tenth room. A farmer invested 80,000 copper coins (when the rice price was 5,000 to 6,000 per stone). The farmer and his son have been farming and paying rent for more than thirty years and have never defaulted on rent. In recent years, the Chen family has often borrowed rent in advance. The fact that the seed money has been repeatedly increased and the government's 25% rent reduction law shows its utmost care for tenant farmers, which is admired all over the world. Now the Chen family landlord ignores the damage to the poor farmers and wants to redeem the five mu of rented land for 250 legal tender (not worth one liter of rice). May I ask how much money is needed to rent other people's land at this time? Many tenant farmers have no land to cultivate, and this situation is very common in the countryside. I dare to ask legal experts to comment fairly and the government to give guidance to help the poor farmers, which would be a great merit.</p>
<p>[Lawyer Zhu Yakui answers] What you are asking about, is it a lease right or a permanent tenancy right? If it is a lease right, it should be handled in accordance with the lease section of the Civil Code's Law of Obligations; if it is a permanent tenancy right, it should be handled in accordance with the permanent tenancy section of the Civil Code's Law of Property, and the Land Law may also be consulted.</p>
<p>(2) During the period of Miao He Nian, 660 legal tender was borrowed to a business established by a friend in 1929 (at that time, the business issued a passbook and stated that the interest rate was 1.2% per month). Up to 1936, 210 legal tender was settled, without calculating interest. Later, repeated requests for repayment were made. The August 13th Incident broke out, and the business closed down. At that time, the principal issued a receipt for collection, stating that it would be repaid the following year. During the occupation period, this person held an important position in the puppet fishery market and was repeatedly asked to repay the debt, but it was repeatedly rejected by the special forces at that time. Now that the sun is shining again, I wonder if the current law has any provisions for repaying the principal and interest proportionally based on the price of goods (or the cost of living)? Please provide guidance and answers.</p>
<p>[Lawyer Zhu Yakui answers] Regarding the situation you asked about, you should refer to Article 12 of the Supplementary Regulations on Handling Civil Lawsuits After Restoration. The court should fairly weigh the matter and increase or decrease the payment. (3) Xiang Songnian asks: My relative, Xu Jun, has two brothers. In 1934, due to the death of both parents, they invited relatives to discuss the division of property and signed a "division agreement," each holding a copy. The agreement stated that a formal division deed should be made within one year. Later, the two brothers went to other cities to make a living, which led to the delay in the formal division deed. Now the elder brother announced that the formal division deed should be signed immediately. The younger brother expressed his agreement upon hearing the news. However, the elder brother overturned most of the clauses in the division agreement signed in 1934. The reasons he gave are:</p>
<p>First, the division agreement is a temporary contract, and the agreement stated that a formal division deed should be signed within one year. After one year, the agreement will naturally not have legal effect. Second, the clauses in the agreement are not suitable for the current situation. Therefore, the formal division deed should be revised to show rationality. Third, the agreement was signed more than twelve years ago and is now just a waste paper. I am a close relative of the Xu brothers and was one of the witnesses when the division agreement was established. Unfortunately, more than ten years have passed, and the other relatives who were witnesses have all passed away. What should be decided?</p>
<p>[Lawyer Zhu Yakui answers] (1) If it is of a preparatory nature, it cannot be said to be naturally invalid; (2) (3) Amendments to the clauses require the consent of both parties.</p>

<p>Selling each prescription for 1,000 yuan</p>
<p>Editor: Recently, I saw in your newspaper that the Xinzi National Drug Store in this city is distributing 10,000 doses of medicine according to the proven lung disease prescription of Director Zhang Xishen of Fengxiang County, Shaanxi, and donating them to the poor and sick. Those who do not wish to receive the donation will be charged a cost price of 1,000 legal tender per dose. The retail price of prepared herbs is inherently different from the wholesale price of drug stores, and according to the price list issued by the guild, arbitrary increases or decreases are not allowed. Therefore, although our store has the intention to follow suit, it is unable to do so due to the regulations. Now, an anonymous philanthropist, moved by the ambition to help those in need, has instructed our store to sell them at the standard rate of 1,000 yuan per dose, and he will bear the shortfall. Our store, for the benefit of the people, respectfully accepts the offer and will start selling from August 1st.

<h3 id="e135">Childhood Tuberculosis <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Yinhe</p>
<p>Our country does not pay much attention to childhood tuberculosis. Although there are anti-tuberculosis movements, their focus is mostly on adults, and the number of children suffering from tuberculosis seen daily is increasing. Although there are no accurate statistics, according to estimates from general hospitals, patients with tuberculosis sometimes account for more than 50% of outpatient visits; and sometimes even account for 60-70% of hospitalized patients; and the number of children who die from this disease is countless. The most painful and difficult to deal with are tuberculous meningitis and miliary tuberculosis. It can be said that there is absolutely no way to cure these two types of tuberculosis. To avoid the occurrence of such terminal illnesses, strict prevention should be carried out in advance. It must be known that children are the vitality of the nation, and maintaining the health of children is maintaining the vitality of the nation; the premature death of children is a new wound to the vitality of the nation, and also a loss to the country.</p>
<p>Cause of Disease</p>
<p>Tuberculosis is a special and most common infectious disease, and its main cause is the invasion of tubercle bacilli into the body. Other factors such as malnutrition, poverty, overwork, polluted environment, impure air, insufficient sunlight, insufficient sleep, and suffering from pertussis and measles reduce resistance. This can be said to be the remote cause of tuberculosis. Children are most susceptible to the invasion of tubercle bacilli. If parents have tuberculosis, especially the mother, who has the most contact with children, and they do not know how to isolate themselves and continue to feed food mouth to mouth or kiss, how can infection be avoided? Others such as wet nurses, nannies, or close relatives who have contact with children also have the possibility of transmitting the disease.</p>
<p>Symptoms</p>
<p>Tubercle bacilli are divided into two types, human and bovine: the former is mostly transmitted through the respiratory tract, and the latter is mostly obtained from milk. The resistance of tubercle bacilli is extremely strong outside the human body. In places with insufficient sunlight, poor air circulation, and darkness, they can survive for months or even years, but they die within a few days under the scorching sun. The route of their invasion into the human body can be divided into three places, namely the respiratory tract, digestive tract, and skin. The latter is the rarest. The affected area may be limited to one part or spread throughout the body, depending on the strength of each person's physique and the amount and toxicity of the bacilli that invade. Their invasion of the human body is not easy to detect during the incubation period. It is not until the disease develops that symptoms appear, and the symptoms of children are not as obvious as those of adults. The most common symptoms are fever, cough, loss of appetite, irritability, weight loss or no weight gain, and anemia. The difference between childhood tuberculosis and adult tuberculosis is that lymph node patients are more numerous and have strong diffusion, and the course of the disease progresses faster. Early tuberculosis is often easily overlooked, and when it is discovered, the disease has reached a critical juncture. Therefore, the earlier this disease is discovered, the greater the hope of recovery, and the later it is discovered, the less hope there is.</p>
<p>Childhood tuberculosis can be roughly divided into the following three categories: (1) Systemic tuberculosis, including the lungs, abdomen, bones, lymph nodes, and urogenital organs. The final processes are tuberculous meningitis and miliary tuberculosis. (2) Intrathoracic tuberculosis can be further divided into primary tuberculosis, hilar tuberculosis, tuberculous pneumonia, pleurisy, and miliary pulmonary tuberculosis. (3) Acute miliary tuberculosis</p>
<p>In diagnosis, family history must first be emphasized in childhood tuberculosis. If there are tuberculosis patients in the family, children are difficult to avoid. Others are tuberculin skin tests and X-ray examinations.</p>
<p>Prognosis</p>
<p>To know the outcome of children with tuberculosis, the following points are directly related: (1) The younger the age, the more dangerous it is, and the faster the disease progresses. (2) The internal and external infection environment is also related. Children with tuberculosis patients in the family may have complications. (3) The location and type of the disease. Patients with tuberculous meningitis and acute miliary tuberculosis have almost no hope. (4) The original physique of the sick child. Those with a strong physique are more likely to recover.</p>
<p>Treatment</p>
<p>There is no specific medicine for tuberculosis to date. The principle of its treatment is to maintain and increase the body's resistance. The most common methods today are as follows: (1) General therapy: The most important of these is rest therapy. Children with tuberculosis must sleep at least ten to fourteen hours every night, rest for a while before lunch, take a two-hour nap after lunch, and rest for a while before dinner. They should not exercise too much. It is often not easy for children to get sufficient rest in the home environment. If there is a children's sanatorium, children can receive education in addition to rest. The second general therapy is fresh air. Everyone knows the benefits of fresh air for tuberculosis. Patients with tuberculosis should rest outdoors, on the one hand to get sunlight treatment. Sunlight is effective for tuberculous lymphadenitis and tuberculous skin diseases. The third is proper diet. A proper diet should be simple and rich in calories and vitamins. Fresh vegetables, eggs, milk, cheese, and fish are foods rich in nutrients. The fourth is proper medical management. Children's temperature and weight should be paid attention to daily. If symptoms such as colds occur, they must be treated promptly. In short, children with tuberculosis need the guidance of a doctor at all times. (2) Special therapy: The injection of tuberculin has undergone many tests, and the results are not very good, so it cannot be used. The new drug Streptomycin, recently published in American magazines, is said to be effective against tuberculosis. It has had considerable success in animal experiments, but clinically it has only had good results in a patient with tuberculous laryngitis. It is hoped that in the near future, there will be a large number of special medicines for various types of tuberculosis, so as to benefit the patients.</p>
<p>Prevention</p>
<p>Since there is no specific treatment for tuberculosis, and its harm is so great, the most important thing is prevention. Westerners have a saying: "An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure." This is an irrefutable conclusion in medical theory. Childhood tuberculosis should also start with prevention. (1) Treatment for those who already have tuberculosis. Anyone suspected of having tuberculosis should be diagnosed early and isolated. Special attention should be paid to mothers with tuberculosis to avoid infecting their children. Bad habits such as mouth-to-mouth feeding and kissing should be avoided. If the sputum contains tubercle bacilli, it needs to be isolated, as there is a possibility of infection at any time. The patient's sputum, as well as the towels, clothing, and tableware they use, should be disinfected at all times. (2) General prevention: (A) Education: Our country's education is backward, especially in terms of medical knowledge. Mothers chewing food and feeding infants, kissing children, and things like that are often thought of as expressions of love, but in fact they are the media for spreading disease. Unless the public's attention is awakened to its harm, tuberculosis will never be reduced. As for promoting public health, improving parental education, and imparting medical knowledge, these are all urgent tasks at present. Recently, there have been anti-tuberculosis movements and health exhibitions in cities, but they have not yet been popularized in rural areas and small towns. This is something that the government and social figures must be responsible for promoting. (B) Nutrition: Malnutrition, physical weakness, and diseases are prone to attack, so we must pay attention to proper nutrition. However, in China, where production is backward and the economy is bankrupt, it is difficult to promote proper nutrition. (C) Physical examination of children: Physical examinations of children should be performed at least twice a year, which can not only show how health is progressing, but also prevent problems before they occur. The earlier this disease is discovered, the greater the hope of recovery, and the later it is discovered, the less hope there is. This can save children from illness. (3) Special prevention: BCG vaccination has had a great number of reports and has had considerable success in preventing tuberculosis. BCG is a virulent live bacillus that is harmless to the human body and can stimulate the production of immune bodies. Subcutaneous and intradermal injections can reduce the incidence of tuberculosis. Those who have not had tuberculosis and have the possibility of transmission in the family may wish to try it.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>In short, tuberculosis is one of the most severe problems in our country today, and its impact is enough to damage the country's vitality and shorten people's lives. The scope of this topic is too broad to be fully described in a few words. What is described above is just the most common common sense, the intention is to arouse the attention of readers, so that tuberculosis will gradually decrease in China, until there is none. This is the author's only wish.</p>
<h3 id="e136">Child Mental Hygiene: Sleep Problems <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>— Liu Yueci</p>
<p>Most people with unhealthy minds, eight or nine out of ten, do not have normal sleep. This proves that there is a close relationship between sleep and mental health. "Habit becomes nature," so we must cultivate good sleeping habits in childhood to promote the healthy development of both mind and body. Now, let's first examine the sleep problems of children.</p>
<p>Causes of Insomnia</p>
<p>The causes of insomnia in children are mostly due to illness, but sometimes they are also caused by the formation of bad habits, resulting in the inability to have normal sleep. Newborn infants, if healthy, generally need to sleep about twenty to twenty-two hours a day. Therefore, it can be said that a large portion of an infant's time is spent sleeping. Afterwards, the amount of sleep gradually decreases with age. For example, children around ten years old need eleven or twelve hours of sleep, while adults only need seven or eight hours of sound sleep. Healthy children usually have no problems with sleep. However, some parents and nannies, fearing that their children cannot fall asleep immediately, hold them in their arms, rocking and patting them to make them fall asleep quickly. Once this bad habit is formed, it is impossible to make the children fall asleep without doing so in the future. Therefore, parents who want their children to have good sleeping habits should not be overly affectionate. Just put the children in another room and on another bed at bedtime, and they will naturally follow the routine and fall asleep peacefully.</p>
<p>Bad Practices</p>
<p>Let's cite a bad practice: when children reach the age of five or six, some parents are overly doting and pay special attention to their children's sleep. For example, at bedtime, the mother will lead the child's hand to the bedroom, close the windows tightly to prevent wind from entering, take off the child's clothes, cover them with blankets, and fearing that the child will not fall asleep easily, tell them interesting or surprising stories until the child is tired. Only then does the mother let go of the child's hand and ask if they are comfortable. Then, as if reluctant to leave, she says to them, "Be good, sleep now. Mother is by your side, don't be afraid of anything." In this way, she tirelessly repeats checking the bedding, windows, etc., before tiptoeing away. Imagine, how can such handling of a child's sleep not increase the child's dependence? In the future, they will need these rituals to fall asleep. Also, some children, after being accompanied by their mothers, are afraid that their mothers will leave, so they deliberately show signs of unease. Over time, the child's dependence increases, making the mother who dotes on the child feel that the child's sleep is a serious and difficult problem. The child first has difficulty falling asleep, then gradually develops insomnia, and insomnia eventually leads to various unhealthy psychological states in adulthood.</p>
<p>Many symptoms are commonly found in children during sleep. The most common are:</p>
<p>(1) Nightmares: Children suffering from this condition do not have difficulty falling asleep. What is strange is that they often suddenly shout and scream in fright while having a good dream. The reason is that they have encountered frightening scenes in their dreams, such as being chased by ferocious beasts, robbed by robbers, or climbing mountains and entering forests, etc. After waking up, the children can vividly describe their encounters in the dream and are quite thought-provoking.</p>
<p>(2) Night Terrors: The various frightening expressions after waking up in a dream are not much different from the above-mentioned nightmares. The difference is that after waking up in fright, the children have no recognition of the surrounding environment or people. After their fearful expressions, the children can still fall asleep peacefully. If you ask them the next day what they were afraid of the night before, they mostly cannot remember.</p>
<p>(3) Sleepwalking: This refers to suddenly getting up or walking elsewhere in a sleep state, or doing things that are usually done. For example, a housewife may tidy up the room at that time, and a student may open the cabinet and read medical reports. Although they often have their eyes tightly closed while sleepwalking, they can do very ingenious things. Many people think that sleepwalking is driven by gods and monsters. In fact, sleepwalking, like nightmares and night terrors, are all the same, all psychological symptoms of children related to sleep and have nothing to do with superstition. The most important thing to pay attention to with sleepwalking is to especially reduce the various stimuli in the hours before the child goes to sleep. Secondly, for the sake of the sleepwalker's own safety, make sure they do not live in a multi-story building, so as to avoid accidentally walking down the stairs while sleepwalking and falling and getting injured due to unconscious negligence.</p>
<p>(4) Others: In addition, sleep symptoms such as drowsiness and constant fatigue have many factors. They may be caused by morphine and bromide poisoning or by encephalitis. Psychological sleep disorders, such as excessive laziness in personality, requiring a nap of one or two dozen hours a day, are best discussed with a psychotherapist, which is more beneficial.</p>
<p>In short, sleep can harmonize the health of our body and mind. If there is not enough sleep at night, we cannot work energetically during the day. Children's sleep time should be regular and should not be lenient or exceptional. There is no need to watch over children's sleep as if attending a grand ceremony. Children should be made to see sleep as a simple and natural behavior, so that they know the benefits of sleep. Do not make children fall asleep first as a punishment, as this may make them hate sleep. Do not make children dependent on their parents. Teach them to dress themselves from a young age, and do not use accompaniment and storytelling as hypnotics. In this way, children's sleep disorders will naturally gradually decrease. With sufficient sleep, children's physical and mental development will enter a normal state, and the development of mental health will be without objection.</p>

<h3 id="e137">Preventing "Milk Malnutrition" <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>— Fei</p>
<p>Chinese infants often suffer from indigestion, excessive crying, and sallow and emaciated faces after weaning. In summer, they are even more prone to illness due to restlessness and lack of sleep, causing their parents to be uneasy day and night. This is commonly called "milk malnutrition." In medical terms, it is due to insufficient preparation before weaning and inadequate nutrition after weaning, which is actually a symptom of malnutrition.</p>
<p>In China, human milk is the main food for infants, and some even hire wet nurses because their own milk is insufficient. The advantages of human milk for infants are countless, so I will not repeat them here. Infants under six months of age who receive adequate human milk feeding can almost keep pace with European and American infants in terms of growth and development, with no shortcomings. However, after six months, the growth and development of Chinese infants gradually slows down, and even stagnates, which is clearly inferior to that of European and American infants. The author once examined thousands of infants in Changsha, Hunan, and created charts and curves to compare them with European and American infants, and obtained the above results.</p>
<p>Milk is the best and most suitable food for infants, but its nutrient content still has some shortcomings. The most obvious is the lack of iron and several vitamins. Therefore, milk feeding can only meet the needs of infants under six months of age at most. In fact, infants must be given various supplementary foods on time in order to have normal growth and development.</p>
<p>Most Chinese infants rely entirely on human milk feeding, even until they are one or two years old. Such feeding methods not only lag behind in growth and development but also suffer from various diseases due to malnutrition and weak resistance. Infant beriberi, anemia, colds, coughs, diarrhea, etc., are all examples. Just look at these young infants suffering from these various diseases, no wonder their growth and development are far inferior to others.</p>
<p>The prevention method is very simple, just add supplementary foods on time. Supplementary foods are nutritional foods for infants other than milk.</p>
<p>(1) One to Four Months</p>
<p>Infants around one month old should be given orange juice, vegetable soup, dry yeast powder, and cod liver oil to supplement vitamins A, B, C, and D. Orange juice is rich in vitamin C. One-month-old infants can be given orange juice three times a day, one to two teaspoons each time. For the supply of vitamin B, dry yeast powder is often used for convenience, three times a day, half a gram each time. Infants in cities who cannot get sunlight often need to be given cod liver oil, three times a day, half a teaspoon each time, gradually increasing to one teaspoon; or concentrated cod liver oil, three times a day, five to ten drops each time.</p>
<p>(2) Five to Six Months</p>
<p>Infants over five months old gradually have a larger appetite and stronger digestion, and are about to start teething. In addition to liquids, they should be given semi-liquid foods that are easy to digest. Millet porridge, rice porridge, and oatmeal porridge can all be used. Five- and six-month-old infants can be fed porridge twice a day. Initially, one tablespoon each time, gradually increasing to four tablespoons.</p>
<p>(3) Seven to Ten Months</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, milk lacks iron. The liver of full-term infants stores a large amount of iron, and most of the iron is supplied from this store for the first six months after birth. After six months, the stored iron gradually runs out. If they are fed purely with milk and other nutrients lacking in iron, they will inevitably develop anemia. Spinach, egg yolk, etc., are all rich in iron and can be gradually added. Infants who are eating eggs for the first time must first be given egg yolk. If there is no problem after a few days, then they can eat the whole egg. This is because a few children have allergic reactions to egg white.</p>
<p>Green, yellow, and red vegetables, all colored vegetables, are not only rich in iron and vitamins but also have the function of lubricating the intestines, as do fruits. Seven-month-old infants can eat vegetable puree, and nine- and ten-month-old infants can also eat cooked fruit puree. Vegetable puree and fruit puree can replace orange juice and cabbage water.</p>
<p>(4) Eleven Months to Two Years</p>
<p>At this time, it is time to stop breastfeeding. The method of allocating food is nothing more than reducing the number of meals and gradually replacing the food, from liquids to semi-liquids to various soft foods, to suit the physiological changes of the child and achieve normal development.</p>
<p>The so-called supplementary foods are not to supplement the insufficient amount of human milk or milk but to supplement the insufficient quality of human milk or milk in order to meet the needs of infant growth and development at each stage. If breast milk is insufficient, it should be supplemented with milk. Those who cannot afford to buy milk can buy soy milk to replace it. However, milk and soy milk cannot replace supplementary foods. Using pure milk without adding supplementary foods can cause the same symptoms.</p>
<p>In Chinese society, there are many cases of so-called "milk malnutrition." If it is not corrected early, it can indeed lead to illness or even death. Therefore, with the theme of preventing malnutrition, I have briefly described the principles and methods of preventing "milk malnutrition" to offer to the parents of infants with this condition.</p>

<h3 id="e138">The Future of Publishing <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>— Wang Pingling</p>
<p>When people in Beijing held a meeting to commemorate Ye Gongchuo a few days ago, I was stuck in Chongqing and could not attend. I am writing this article to commemorate Ye's achievements in promoting the Chinese literary movement and donating the manuscript fee to the Ye's scholarship. - Author's note</p>
<p>1. Why Do Publications Lack Sales?</p>
<p>Assuming that, according to the proportion of the Chinese population, one in every thousand people is willing to buy and read books, then a decent book can sell 450,000 copies. But now the average sales of each book (referring to better works) is only 2,000 copies, which means that out of every 200,000 people, only one person buys books. That is to say, if the entire population of Shanghai is three million, then the number of customers for publications is only fifteen. The sluggish sales of Chinese publications are truly shocking! This ironclad fact is right in front of everyone's eyes, and even the "skeleton fetishists" who stubbornly cling to the past cannot be proud.</p>
<p>The sluggish sales of publications prove that there are too few learned and thoughtful people in China. The number of illiterate people was estimated to be over 88% in the past. Whether it has decreased now remains to be seen.</p>
<p>Why do publications lack sales? I think it is definitely not because of the weak purchasing power at the moment, because the sales of publications before the war were even worse than now. Yet the business of imported goods, which are many times more expensive than before, is still particularly prosperous. If we want to find a real explanation for this problem, there are several reasons:</p>
<p>(1) Due to the stagnation of publication sales, manuscript fees are low and royalties are hopeless, which makes writers in various fields unable to live in poverty and affects the content of publications, which cannot keep pace with the times. This directly hinders the sales of publications.</p>
<p>(2) The standard of living in society is too low. Most ordinary people are not forced by the times to the point where they cannot survive without a little knowledge and skills. They can barely survive by relying on raw physical strength and basic experience. They are naturally willing to learn to read, but it does not seem necessary to force themselves to find opportunities to learn to read.</p>
<p>(3) Intellectuals who have left school and mixed in various levels of society rarely apply what they learned in school. At most, they use a few familiar characters for communication, reading newspapers, writing a few satirical poems, or drafting obituaries, inscriptions, and other tools to perfunctorily deal with the current situation! Even common sense is rarely used. More specialized skills and advanced academics are still a noble luxury at the moment. Therefore, the general Chinese intellectual feels that literacy is enough, why bother reading!</p>
<p>(4) The atmosphere in the interior is closed and transportation is inconvenient. New publishing industries are concentrated in major commercial ports and capital cities, making it difficult to spread newly published books and periodicals to remote areas and popularize them in "barren lands" of culture. The villages scattered among farmers, who account for more than 80% of the total population, are such a vast area. But no one has tried to spread "seeds of reading," make efforts to eliminate illiteracy, set up primary schools, or establish rural museums and libraries. Therefore, the vast rural areas of China still follow the ancient traditions and live in a semi-civilized state. Even if you send modern new publications thousands of miles away on time, they will not appreciate them.</p>
<p>(5) Officials and employees of companies and banks in cities, although they also come from schools in the past and are also known as intellectuals, are busy engaging in intrigue, dancing and vying for favor, and appeasing superiors and colleagues, just to perfunctorily deal with official affairs. Where do they have the leisure and ease of mind to review the old and learn the new? Even officials who claim to be experts and scholars admit that they have become rusty and have completely abandoned what they learned in the past after mixing in officialdom for too long!</p>
<p>(6) Some upstarts who made a fortune by taking advantage of the war and national crisis, as well as the pampered wives, concubines, dance partners, and mistresses that these people specially married for fun, everything is for enjoyment, and "enjoyment" is the sole purpose of life. If they encounter erotic treasures that stimulate "sexual function," yellow reading materials that emphasize "eroticism," leg movies, or dramas that allow them to feast their eyes, they may occasionally browse them to relieve boredom when they are tired of playing sand crabs and mahjong. As for all books that are not related to "enjoyment," that is, books that can increase wisdom and improve personal qualities, these people disdain them.</p>
<p>Based on the above facts, we do not need to doubt why the Chinese do not read books.</p>
<p>At the same time, the books piled up in bookstores are worthless bad books, but they are not without patrons. A large number of avid supporters are waiting for them, and there is a reason for this.</p>
<p>2. How Can We Continue Like This?</p>
<p>"Alas! How can we continue like this!" I often hear a few patriotic people who are worried about the world, witnessing the immaturity and decline of Chinese culture, sighing to the heavens. However, this group of worriers only knows how to sigh and does not know what kind of adverse effects this situation will have on society if it really continues. I would like to analyze it further:</p>
<p>(1) Everyone knows that this world war is entirely a war of culture and a war of science. Countries with declining cultures and immature sciences will only perish and will never be spared. If the Chinese are forever proud of their ancestors' legacy and do not catch up with the world's cultural standards or actively improve their scientific wisdom, then the science and culture on which China relies for its nationhood will never have any hope of revitalization.</p>
<p>(2) Some opportunistic and ignorant lucky people, after fooling around in society for some time, can still make a fortune, get promoted, gain fame and wealth, and be supported by the blind and praised by public opinion. Then, no one is a fool, so why bother spending the time used for promotion, making a fortune, and becoming famous in science laboratories, libraries, or writing desks! Anyway, the more profound the learning and the more successful the experiments, the less likely people are to have a way out. It may even be impossible to avoid freezing and starvation. Why suffer for nothing? Since evil is a common "talent" of mankind, who would not do evil if evil-doers are lucky!</p>
<p>(3) The prosperity of science and the establishment of academic disciplines require decades of research and multi-faceted cultivation by the state before they can bloom and bear fruit. It cannot be achieved overnight. Now, a pure academic atmosphere has not been cultivated. Everyone is choosing shortcuts to wealth and seeking quick wealth, or using "anti-social" psychology to create novelty and gain superficial fame. Thousands of fathers and brothers, seeing those people's opportunistic ascents, would rather send their children to banks as trainees and worship powerful families as godfathers. How can society not regard schools as prisons and treat learning as worthless! We only need to understand these three possible crises to make people who care about the world immediately come up with real solutions to save this root cause of national extinction! What's the use of just sighing!</p>
<p>3. How to Save the Publishing Industry's Predicament?</p>
<p>Publishing institutions in the interior have suffered great losses and are on the verge of collapse. During the war, we were fully committed to the final victory and had no time to replant the seeds of spiritual civilization on the barren ruins in order to re-bloom and bear large fruits. At the same time, our international lines were trapped by the Japanese invaders for a period of time, which not only blocked our mutual material assistance but also hindered our spiritual exchange. In the full eight years, new books published in Europe and America, whether in science, philosophy, or literature and art, were almost completely cut off from their source. Culture can only progress through mutual comparison and observation. In such a long period of isolation, losing cooperation and contact, our cultural circles, even if they are unwilling to lag behind in the war, still have some achievements; but they can never fill the void and compensate for the losses brought about by the war. In the future, if we really want to save the crisis of the publishing industry, it is certainly very important to enrich the source of spirit, communicate cultural exchanges, improve publishing conditions, and improve the treatment of writers. It is even more urgent to provide writers in various fields with a better environment so that they can sit down and take some time to re-learn and seek to enrich themselves.</p>
<p>During the war, the publishing industry was mostly oppressed by high prices and suffered from the pain of social unrest. It was not easy to accept works in various fields according to reasonable publishing plans. In order to avoid closing down due to losses, they had to pay attention to "business acumen" and take the position of "making money first, culture second" when selecting manuscripts for publication. According to the experience of the publishing industry, the sales of scientific and specialized works are far inferior to literature. Among literature, poetry is inferior to novels, and novels are inferior to lucky scripts. And books of this kind that adopt literary forms and use literary techniques to write out "life experiences, success secrets, love philosophies, and a collection of love letters..." are even more popular than lucky scripts. Therefore, during the war, the publishing rate of science was the lowest. The publishing industry failed to grasp the focus of the times and cooperate with the needs of national policy, which is also a reason for the sluggishness of the publishing industry. As another great era—the great era of striving for peace and construction—is beginning today, our publishing industry should also change its style! (To be continued)</p>

<p>— Xuehua</p>
<p>When I woke up in the middle of last night, I found half of my pillow was wet. I reached out to touch my face, and it was covered in tears. I realized I was really crying.</p>
<p>What's so strange about me crying? In these past few years, especially in the last half year, my tears have been like the rain during the moldy season. With just a slight breeze, a tiny cloud, they would fall continuously, falling, falling into the vast and boundless ocean of sadness.</p>
<p>I had an old dream, a strange dream. —</p>
<p>The scene in the dream was exactly like it was twenty years ago: I was wearing a short shirt and pants with a white background and blue flowers, and my hair was tied into two small braids with red headbands. I was standing in a bright room. My small body was leaning against the corner of an Eight Immortals table. My small eyes were looking at a lion cat with a thick tail at my feet. My small ears were listening to a loving voice:</p>
<p>"I'm leaving. I'll come to see you again next time I pass by Wuxi. While you're here, you must listen to your adoptive parents, and you must study hard so that you can become a useful person in the future, do you hear?"</p>
<p>Of course, I heard, and I understood, and I understood even more. My young heart trembled as it said:</p>
<p>"Foster father, I know! I will definitely listen to you, obey them, study hard, and become a useful person!"</p>
<p>But I didn't say that. I cried out "Ah!" —</p>
<p>Was that when I woke up? My face and pillow were covered in tears. I realized I was really crying.</p>
<p>What's so strange about me crying? My tears have been like the rain during the moldy season. With just a slight breeze, a tiny cloud, they would quickly and continuously fall, falling, falling into the vast and boundless ocean of sadness.</p>
<p>However, this time, when I cried, my crying was a little different than usual!</p>
<h3 id="e140">Trees <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>— Written by H. Hesse, translated by Ma Yufeng</p>
<p>Hesse is a famous modern German writer, but not a Nazi writer, so he is still very worth introducing. "Trees" is translated from the Japanese book "Wandering and Nostalgia"—Translator</p>
<p>In my opinion, trees are always the most poignant preachers. I respect trees when they live as a nation, as a family, as a forest, but I respect them even more when they stand alone. Trees are like solitary individuals—not those weak, escapist fellows, but like Beethoven and Nietzsche, great isolated people. The world clamors in their treetops, their roots rest in the "infinite." But the tree is not completely submerged in the infinite. It lifts all the strength of its life and only wants to strive to accomplish one thing, that is, to realize the law of itself that is inherent in the tree, to make its original posture, to express itself. Nothing is as sacred and exemplary as a beautiful and powerful tree. A tree is sawn down, exposing its fresh wound to the sun. On its broken stump, that is, on the smooth plane of its base, one can read the entire history of the tree. All the battles, all the suffering, all the diseases, all the happiness, and prosperity are faithfully recorded in the annual rings and scars—small ages and large ages, irresistible attacks and endured storms. And the hard and noble tree, with the densest annual rings, the most powerful ideal trunk, grows in high mountains and constant danger. These things, any country child understands.</p>
<p>Trees are sacred things. Those who can speak to trees and listen to trees will understand the truth. Trees do not preach lessons and practices. Trees do not meddle with individual things but speak of the fundamental laws of life.</p>
<p>A tree says, "Inside me hides a seed, a spark, a thought. I am eternal life. The eternal mother's experiment and attempt to create me is eternity. My shape and texture are eternity. The trembling leaves on my top, the small scars on my skin, are also eternity. My work is to form eternity in this unique eternity."</p>
<p>A tree says, "I am faith. I don't know my ancestors, nor do I know the thousands of children born from myself every year. I believe that God dwells within myself, and I believe in the sacredness of my work. Because of this belief, I live."</p>
<p>When we feel sad and cannot endure life, perhaps a tree will say to us, "Be quiet! Be quiet! Look at my appearance! Life without joy or life without difficulty is a child's idea. Please silence the thought of what is in your heart, then the worry will disappear. Don't worry, your path will take you away from your mother and homeland, but step by step, day by day, it will bring you back to your mother's place again. Home is not on this side or that side, home is within you; otherwise, there is no home anywhere."</p>
<p>At dusk, when I hear the trees rustling in the wind, wandering longings stir in my chest. Listen quietly for a long time. Wandering longings reveal their core and meaning, which is not, as seen at a glance, to escape from troubles, but a longing for the homeland, for the mother's memory, for the new posture of life. This is returning home. Every road is returning home. Every step is birth, every step is death. Every tomb is a mother.</p>
<p>When we hold anxieties in our childish thoughts, the trees rustle their leaves in the evening wind, saying so. Just as trees have a longer life than us, trees also have profound thoughts. Only when we don't listen to trees are trees wiser than us; conversely, learning to listen to trees can turn the shortcomings, confusion, and childish sadness of our thoughts into unparalleled joy. Those who learn to listen to trees do not hope to become trees, nor do they want to hope to become something other than themselves. Oneself is the homeland, is happiness.</p>

<p>US Ambassador Leighton Stuart has a slight illness. We Chinese feel particularly sorry. This old friend of seventy-one years of age has been running back and forth, working tirelessly, worrying himself sick whether it's cold or hot up and down the mountains. Now that he has fallen ill from exhaustion, we don't know how to live with ourselves. Because of Stuart's illness, we are even more worried about another old man, Marshal Ma. We sincerely pray that Stuart can recover soon and that Marshal will take good care of himself!</p>
<p>However, we would like to particularly point out something for the two elders to consider. Who is right and who is wrong, who is deliberately causing trouble, is already crystal clear, so it's better to make it public. Otherwise, it's just a waste of energy, and the result won't be satisfactory, which is really not worth it!</p>
<p>(2) Father's Day</p>
<p>Setting August 8th as Father's Day is of profound significance. Who doesn't have parents? Who doesn't have children? Everyone will agree with this. Moreover, launching this movement before the victory of the Anti-Japanese War last year even has the intention of "ostensibly celebrating fathers, implying remembrance of the motherland. Since the Eastern Prefecture has fallen, the people still long for Shu." The intention is profound and painstaking.</p>
<p>Society is superficial, and people's hearts are no longer as they used to be. In today's social atmosphere where only interests are emphasized, Father's Day has an even greater role to play in promoting national morality. To repay kindness and respect relatives, we hope that everyone can remember "where this body comes from."</p>
<h3 id="e143">Freak <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>— Ziye</p>
<p>Four hands, four feet, two heads, one head eating milk, one head sleeping.</p>
<p>Five or six days ago, a strange story spread in this village, saying that a woman in Nan'ao gave birth to a child with two heads, four feet, and four hands, which was considered very strange. Later, someone went to see it specifically. In addition to proving that what was said was true, they brought back many stranger and stranger news.</p>
<p>"It's extremely strange! That child has four kidneys (testicles) but only one urethra." He made a gesture triumphantly and said, "There are two mouths sucking milk, but only one hole (anus) for excreting."</p>
<p>"Such a freak is rare in the world. A few days ago, I saw in yesterday's newspaper that a freak was born in a certain place in Japan, which is the second known in the world. Then, yours should be the third." The house owner seemed very happy after hearing my words.</p>
<p>Finally, I told them that freaks are due to incomplete division of the fertilized egg and are not unlucky in any way, and I allowed them to write a press release and send it to various newspapers for publication.</p>
<p>"Old man, take good care of this baby!" When I left his house, I whispered and said this.</p>
<p>"Seeing is believing," "Even a live tiger has to be seen, let alone this rare freak." Curiosity motivated me, and I had to see what was going on. So I made an appointment with my cousin and went to that place specially yesterday afternoon.</p>
<p>When we went in, the house owner was sitting on the threshold talking to three or four other people. When he saw us, he asked our intentions and address. I told him everything.</p>
<p>"Originally, I wouldn't let you see it, but because you are from Jinshantang, and we have contact with each other, let me ask my sister-in-law to bring it out." Under such permission, we waited.</p>
<p>After a while, the woman holding the baby slowly walked to the outside of the room and then sat on the threshold. She was about forty years old, her hair was messy, her eyes were weak, and her face was white and yellow, like a piece of local rough-edged paper. She was wearing a black foreign cloth shirt, which was extremely old. She opened the old clothes wrapped around the baby with a weak and energetic voice and said to us:</p>
<p>"There, please come and see."</p>
<p>So everyone gathered around, and I ran closest to the baby, slightly lowering my body and carefully looking at this rare treasure in the world.</p>
<p>The whole body of the baby is about one foot and five inches long, neither fat nor thin, and the skin is slightly pink. There are indeed two heads, not connected at all; the two faces are very similar, the same size, the same shape, which is really difficult to distinguish without careful observation. The upper half of the body is separated, and each chest can breathe independently. The four hands grow from the shoulders, which are no different from ordinary children.</p>
<p>Seeing this, I asked the woman curiously, "Do the two cry at the same time?" Later, I knew that this question was really stupid.</p>
<p>"No way!" She shook her head. "One is eating milk, and the other is often sleeping."</p>
<p>The abdomen of the baby is connected side by side, and the navel is located in the middle, only one. The genitals are about three or four inches away from the navel, just at the intersection of the second and third feet, with four testicles inside, each hanging down. The whole is like four grapes, but there is only one penis, and all the baby's urine flows out from here. Although the head has two mouths to eat, the excretory anus is still one.</p>
<p>We looked carefully for several minutes. My cousin was afraid that the baby would catch a cold, so he asked the woman to wrap it well. We went back to the original place and talked with Mr. Yang Chunhui (the baby's grandfather), the owner of the house, about some other things, and then pulled the topic back to the baby.</p>
<p>"How long has this child been born?" I asked.</p>
<p>"Twelve days," he replied and continued, "At that time, when we saw such a strange-looking baby, we thought it was unlucky and had the intention of killing it. Later, Mr. × said to me: 'Chunhui, this child is priceless!'" So we raised it until today."</p>
<p>"Really, if you take it to the Shanghai Great World, even if it's five hundred yuan a ticket, many people will come to see it," my cousin, who had just returned from Shanghai, interjected.</p>
<h3 id="e144">Hat in Class <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>— Dongfang Jing</p>
<p>A story is circulating in American universities: A certain professor did not arrive on time for the class, but he had been there before class, because his hat was still on the table. Maybe he went out for something. But after waiting for a full fifteen minutes, he still didn't come. The students became impatient and dispersed one by one.</p>
<p>In the next class, the professor announced that the entire class was absent from the previous class, and he had recorded it all.</p>
<p>The students protested: "You didn't come yourself. We waited for a full fifteen minutes."</p>
<p>"But," the professor retorted, "my essence was on the table. That's the same as me being here myself."</p>
<p>The public opinion ended here.</p>
<p>The next time this professor came to class, the classroom was empty, with not a single student.</p>
<p>But in the center of each chair, there was a hat placed neatly.</p>
<h3 id="e145">The Old Man Preaching on the Road <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>— Youjuan</p>
<p>Every morning, when I lined up at the Jing'an Temple tram stop to wait for the tram, I always saw an old man, holding a white flag with a red cross in one hand, and a Bible in the other, straightening his voice and talking about the principles of Christ. "Come and believe in Jesus. Believe in Jesus and have eternal life. Those who do not believe in Jesus will perish. Humans have no ability, and China itself is useless. Only by relying on Jesus can we survive. Many great people believe in Jesus. You must also believe." Sometimes, even though his voice was already hoarse, he still tried his best to speak, as if he would not give up until he had convinced everyone at the tram stop to believe. But is there any use in him saying this? Alas! More people mock him than sympathize with him, which is really pitiful.</p>
<p>One day, a foreigner, not understanding what he was saying, thought he was a beggar and gave him five hundred yuan. He refused to accept it and said, "I am here to preach the gospel, not to beg for money. Please take it back!" The foreigner was confused by his words, and the people waiting at the station laughed.</p>
<p>When this old man was speaking, I once paid attention to listening to the people talking in front and behind. I have excerpted them below.</p>
<p>"He relies on Jesus to eat. We don't rely on Jesus. Why should we believe in Jesus?"</p>
<p>"This old man is really crazy. What Jesus or no Jesus, he talks about it all day long. Isn't he afraid of getting tired?"</p>
<p>"This person, I think he doesn't even understand himself, and he still wants to teach others!"</p>
<p>"To have this kind of person preach the principles of Jesus, Jesus has really lost all his face."</p>
<p>"Haha! He also says that believing in Jesus will give you food to eat. Look at how thin he is. I don't know if he himself eats enough!"</p>
<p>"China will rely on Jesus? If China relied on Jesus, China would have perished long ago. He's really ignorant."</p>
<p>In short, all kinds of mocking words can be heard almost every day.</p>
<p>This old man is already very old, but he is still so tireless, whether it is under the scorching sun or in the pouring rain, he is not afraid of people's ridicule or scolding. He always stands there, shouting and shouting with a broken voice, never interrupting for a day. No matter how unpleasant he speaks, no matter how unskilled his words are, we should admire and emulate his kind of fearless spirit. If we also use this spirit in our careers, then he can be considered not to have spoken in vain, and we can be considered not to have let him down.</p>
<p>I wish this old man good health!</p>
<h3 id="e146">Why Falsify <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>— Youfu</p>
<p>The sensational Shanghai Railway Bureau's 100 million-dollar embezzlement case, according to various reports, the protagonist of this embezzlement case is the wife of Zhang Hongtu, director of the Materials Department, Ms. Yu Xiangyan, who was once a pseudo-lawyer.</p>
<p>This ironclad fact was determined by the District Prosecutor's Office based on many investigations and the receipt of complaints and confidential reports.</p>
<p>However, according to Yu Xiangyan's handwritten letter, it almost makes one sympathize with the plight of her frail woman, and sympathize with her husband who is honest, law-abiding, and clean. As the District Prosecutor's Office said, "Even if Yu Xiangyan cannot be said to be the principal offender, she is, of course, one of the principals since she is married to Zhang Hongtu, the principal offender in this case. The so-called signing a report to expose embezzlement seems to push it very cleanly, but since Yu Xiangyan had no other intention, why did she avoid meeting? This office certainly has a factual basis before prosecuting them!"</p>
<p>Yes, I think Director Wang's words are very reasonable. As the saying goes, "If you don't do anything wrong during the day, you won't be surprised when someone knocks on the door at night." If Ms. Yu Xiangyan is indeed a good person and has nothing to do with the case, why does she avoid seeing people and only write a letter to defend herself? Isn't this an extremely suspicious point? Doesn't this further increase her "disadvantage"?</p>
<p>I remember that after the Lugou Bridge Incident broke out, Peiping and Tianjin were in danger, and senior generals such as Song Zheyuan withdrew. Only General Zhang Zizhong, the mayor of Tianjin, did not leave. Therefore, people all over the country suspected him, but he was very calm and did not mind. Eventually he returned to Nanjing. Later, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek also understood his difficulties and comforted him. However, people still suspected him until he fought north and south, established great achievements, protected Xiangfan, and died for the country at the front line without retreating when wounded, clearly showing General Zhang Zizhong's heart.</p>
<p>From then on, the facts answered everything.</p>
<p>Relying on a pair of cunning letters and avoiding appearing in court, this method will never be able to express her so-called pure heart. Facts speak louder than eloquence. Why falsify?</p>

<p>— Nanpu Yun</p>
<p>While occasionally checking my collection of books, I found four volumes of "Random Talks of a Wandering Life," written by Liang Zhangju, a famous official of the Qing Dynasty. According to records, Liang was a native of Minhou, Fujian. He entered the Hanlin Academy during the Jiaqing period and rose to the position of Jiangsu Provincial Treasurer during the Daoguang period. Later, he was selected as the Governor of Guangxi. He was the great-grandfather of the traitor Liang Hongzhi. The book "Random Talks of a Wandering Life" is a notebook style, divided into poetry, travel notes, anecdotes, and prescriptions. The writing is concise, and the poems are also elegant and readable. Gong'er, mentioned in the text, is the grandfather of the traitor Liang. Madam Wan Hui is the grandmother of the traitor Liang. Wan Hui came from a famous family, was knowledgeable in classics and history, and was also good at poetry. At that time, she and her father-in-law discussed poetry with Sun Jianian. I am not sure which of the two, Jianian or [missing text], was the father of the traitor Liang. The Liang family has been scholarly for generations and is a descendant of famous officials, but he did not know how to cherish himself and willingly joined the rebels, leading to this obvious disgrace. Commentators pity him. If Zhangju knew underground, he would also cry bitterly in the underworld.</p>

<h3 id="e150">Chinese Medicine in America (Part 1) <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>— Xu Guiting</p>
<p>Chinese medicine is quite prominent in America. In the heart of New York City, there are two very well-known Chinese medicine shops. The tens of thousands of Chinese Americans will never forget the medicine passed down from their ancestors for thousands of years. Boji Pills are a universal remedy commonly used to treat gastrointestinal ailments. They are made by combining several common herbs. If anyone feels feverish, has a cold or cough, gastrointestinal upset, chest tightness, or abdominal pain, they immediately swallow one or two bottles of Boji Pills, and their illness disappears as if by magic. Even Americans who see this can't help but marvel at its effectiveness.</p>
<p>American Friends Are Very Interested</p>
<p>An American friend named Beatrice Oppenheim became interested in our Chinese medicine. She went to a Chinese medicine shop in New York City for a visit. According to her, countless kinds of medicinal materials were displayed in the shop's windows, such as bleached seahorse bones, dried insects, tiger whiskers, crab eyes, deer antlers, seaweed, leaves, roots, and animal bones. It was truly a dazzling array, a feast for the eyes!</p>
<p>During the Pacific War, when Chinese Americans fell ill, they had to reluctantly take Western medicine such as aspirin, cough syrup, and sulfur preparations because no Chinese medicine was being imported. However, recently, those Chinese medicine shops have once again transported large quantities of genuine Chinese medicine from "Tangshan" (a term Chinese overseas use to refer to their motherland). Almost one hundred "Chinatowns" exist across America, where the Chinese overseas are overjoyed to welcome the sacred medicine transported from their motherland.</p>
<p>Chinese Overseas Pharmaceutical Merchants Are Quite Skilled at Promotion</p>
<p>The old shopkeeper told Oppenheim, "It seems to us that your American medicine is not as effective as our country's medicine." However, on the other hand, Chinese medicine shops are prohibited by law from selling those medicines to white people.</p>
<p>The medicine shop stocks over four hundred kinds of medicinal materials. None of them are marked with special symbols. However, the old shopkeeper can wave his hand and pick out any one of them, identifying its type and use without even looking. In the display case, there is ginseng worth a fortune. Each small piece sells for as much as 40 to 95 US dollars. Believe it or not, ginseng is a miracle drug that can turn weakness into strength and bring the dead back to life. If a person lacks vigor, they can try ginseng soup. After drinking it, they will immediately feel energetic, shedding the颓唐appearance of a sick person. When you are sick, ginseng can help you invigorate blood and refresh the mind, and guide other medicinal properties directly to the affected area, driving away the disease. The Chinese overseas in America firmly believe in this.</p>
<p>Even more precious are a pair of deer antlers, priced at US$2,500. This medicinal material is retailed in thin slices. It is said that decocting it into a soup can "invigorate the blood and nourish vitality."</p>
<p>That old shopkeeper continued to promote our Chinese medicine to Oppenheim in a torrential flow of words. He said the following are some effective medicines used to treat various diseases:</p>
<p>For back pain, deer spinal marrow is needed. The best quality comes from deer shot while running downhill. Its tail is the most precious.</p>
<p>For rheumatic bone pain, medicinal wine soaked in Tibetan bear paws is needed.</p>
<p>Bat Brains Also Have Special Effects</p>
<p>The specific medicine for memory loss is bat brains.</p>
<p>Anemia must be treated with herbal stewed chicken.</p>
<p>The effective remedy for kidney disease is dried geckos, snakes, and centipedes, mixed with sugar, white fungus, and honey.</p>
<p>Eye pain and infantile convulsions are diseases mainly treated with bear bile.</p>
<p>Conjunctivitis can be treated with crow's beaks.</p>
<p>Difficult labor requires the "wings" of flying squirrels as the main ingredient.</p>
<p>The specific medicine for tetanus, leprosy, and unnamed poisonous boils is dried snake.</p>
<p>Minor illnesses can be treated by drinking a specially made medicinal juice of tiger heart powder.</p>
<p>Venereal diseases can be treated with buffalo hide ground into powder, which costs US$2.50 per ounce.</p>
