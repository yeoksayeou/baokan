<h3 id="c1">我國已表明基本立塲　東北陰霾可望開朗　軍事衝突嚴重性亦滅 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>〔木報漢口廿七日電〕宋院長過漢時曾語人，東北問題不久當可解次，盼國人勿過憂慮。</p>
<p>〔本報北平廿六日電〕某有資格人士語記者，陰霾重重之東北天空，不久即有晴朗希望，雖蔣主席與魏德邁之會晤，艾森豪威爾之巡視太平洋岸，基倫將軍之來華與華北美陸戰隊司令洛基將軍珍珠港之行，皆倍增東北問題沉重之感，但以實際言之，目前情勢已較前略佳矣。（一）此問題相常公開後，中國之基本立塲與熊度，已更易爲蘇聯所認識，蔣經國携往莫斯科之最後方案，蘇聯可能相當重視。（二）最近簽字之整軍方案，其範圍包括及東北區，已使東北軍事衝突之嚴重性大爲减殺，並有獲得根本解決之可能。（三）東蒙代表團抵平後，雖其是否有國際或黨派背景，尙爲官方所懷疑，但彼等聲明，在中華民國以內求自治，已使官方初次所獲情報所帶來之颶風爲之稍見平息，因此，東北局勢已具有趨於明朗之希望。發言人並吿記者，日前尙有長春鐵路公司人員自渝飛平，今明兩日轉往長春，可證東北問題尙未惡化至去年十一月十七日之程度。張嘉璈短期即來平，傳達中央意旨，並轉往東北，官方人士均相信，張嘉璈北來，將象徵政府對東北有辦法，但亦有人謂：如東北惡化至必需二次長春撤退，張嘉璈仍將前往爲撤退主持人。</p>
<p>〔木報長春廿六日電〕東北問題現達極端重要階段，此雖純爲外交問題，然若干人士則常與內政混為一體，而此若干人士之行動，亦常以外交動態爲轉移，問題之複雜性在此，危險性亦在此。東北各地八路軍甚衆，中有一部係於最近數月間來自山東，餘大部均係就地編成，其勢力以東部爲最，長鐵沿綫亦有散布，由潘開大連之火車，離瀋十里外即有八路軍之關卡，檢查車中旅客。瀋陽·長春間車行至鐵嶺一帶，亦常遭檢查，長春·哈爾濱間之檢查站，則在德惠，彼等與蘇軍間之關係，表面似互不相擾，竟有時亦常遭蘇軍驅逐·以九台縣之接收爲例，該縣縣長喬桂芳首次前往接收時，當地八路軍與蘇軍雜處，蘇城防司令曾建議，由喬氏與八路軍談判，喬堅持須在蘇軍手中接收，以是無結果而回，殆再度接收時，蘇軍已先期令八路軍退出。八路軍縣長楊華雷留書喬氏謂，係依政協決議退讓，決非示弱，嗣喬於接收該縣營城子煤礦時，蘇軍司令且迫八路軍退出周圍五十公里以外，並以三月一日爲期，八路軍毫無異言，而獨於國軍推進時，則不惜拚死阻攔。現瀋陽西北法庫一帶戰事激烈，雙方均有傷亡。接收後農安縣亦曾一度發生遭遇戰，又凡八路軍所在之省縣，現均設立行政機構，據云：行政首長皆爲民選，彼等尙擬邀國民黨人參加，使成聯合形式，據稱：此係根據政協決議，至東北除外之決定，彼等多不提及，此等事賣，率係最近發生者。東北境內有八路軍，亦係近半年內之事，去年接收人員抵此間時，尙在醞釀中，今竟遍地皆是，發展之速，令人驚奇。一般以爲，此等事實之存在，固已在外交上增加不少困難，然若外交與內政截然分開，則解次亦至易易。目前問題焦點仍在外交，但此外交必須公開進行，，一反過去秘密從事、相信倘此間外交活動自始即取公開方式，則次不致有今日之複雜局面。又關於撫順事件，此間始終未發表，大部人民皆不知有此慘案，此最易招致人心已死之誤解。以記者觀察，當前東北間題雖極嚴重，然若接受過去經騐，善求解次之道，亦非不能立即打開僵局，惟此價局打開後之收拾問題，尢其是從事此收拾工作之人選問題，則不能不重新考慮。</p>
<h3 id="c2">長春蘇軍參謀長聲明　撤退工作進行中　期能於美軍離華以前完成 <a href="#c2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>〔塔斯社長春廿六日電〕　林諾夫斯基元帥之參謀長德羅生柯中將，今日舉行新聞記者招待會，發表聲明如下：「鑒於中外報紙所載各種不準確之消息，歪曲蘇軍自東北延遲撤退之眞實情形，馬林諾夫斯基元帥司令部意欲澄淸此種局勢」。「蘇軍之撤退，自一九四五年十一月即開始，但其後因中國政府第一次與第二次之請求，暫行停止，延至二月一日。一九四六年一月十五日，蘇軍又重復撤退，目下仍在進行中，而相當數目之蘇軍，業已離開東北」。「但蘇軍之撤退於進行時所以略有遷延者，乃因中國政府軍隊進駐蘇軍所遺下地區異常緩遲之故，結果在多次情形中，蘇軍不知將所撤土地交與何人。關於此點，有一事値得注意，即去年秋季，中國政府曾不止一次向蘇軍司令提出抗議，謂蘇軍不待中國政府軍隊抵達，即行撤退」。「蘇軍司令部不得不重視此種局勢。此外，必須牢記者，即東北之鐵路與車輛，一大部份已為受紅軍打擊而潰退之日軍所破摧毀，東北煤斤之缺乏與冬季情形，在大體上，對正常之鐵路交通，造成嚴重障礙」。「最後，沿交通錢尤其沿鐵路錢，由於日偽軍隊殘餘所形成之匪徒繼續活躍，並實行進攻，因而妨礙蘇軍之自由移動」。「東北蘇軍指揮部，預期於美軍司令部能將在華美軍撤退之時間以前，完成蘇軍之撤退工作，或無論如何，不遲於此一時間。是以中外某數報紙所載，蘇軍故意自東北延遲撤退之一切消息，均係仇蘇·反動·反民主份子之誹謗揑造，其目的乃在動搖中國民衆對將滿洲日本本帝國主義匪徒奴役中解放出來之紅軍的信任與善意」。</p>
<h3 id="c3">東北境內工業設備　蘇聯無搬運特權　美國務卿否認曾有協議 <a href="#c3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>〔中央社華盛頓廿六日電〕美國務卿貝爾納斯（見圖），今下午於記者招待會中，否認任何三國協定規定蘇聯可取走中國東北境內之機械或工廠設備。記者詢以國務卿知否有任何集團力量國欲破壞四强團結，樂鄭重答稱，四强定可能於平時繼續合作，亦如其於戰時之合作然。</p>
<p>〔美新聞處華盛頓廿六日電〕國務卿只爾納斯本日在招待記者會中宣稱：彼未獲蘇聯佔領部隊自滿州撤退之任何報吿。渠作此聲明時，係答覆記者詢問，以倫敦傳來消息，據莫斯科無綫電廣播，蘇聯在滿州佔領軍大部已行撤退。某記者稱：瀋陽蘇軍司令曾言紅軍自瀋陽若十工廠移去重工業設備，係根據三巨頭之協議，該記者乃詢以果有此種協議否？貝爾納斯答稱：據彼所知，並無此種協議。又某記者詢問、中國方面是否曾以蘇軍搬運物資之事通知美國政府，氏答曰否。貝爾納斯復否認美國政府曾自其自身機構或中蘇方面，獲得蘇聯於鐵路及旅順·大連二港之協定以外，要求滿洲商業特權之報吿。</p>
<h3 id="c4">蘇聯新併版圖　美國已予同意 <a href="#c4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>記者詢國務卿，蘇聯以千島及南庫頁島併人其版圖，是否有違下稱方式，即凡屬永久　置前敵人領土，應於和會時行之，而不應出以片面行動。又此是否可為美國獲取太平洋設防基地之先例？貝爾的斯答稱：如彼比所言，根據國際公法，凡劃讓領土應以條約方式出之，倘根據國際公法，欲使某一土地為人所承認，則唯有循條約之手續方可，此或出於自動，或如戰敗國之出於被動。貝氏答覆記者詢問，以除訂有條約外，彼是否不擬承認以上述地區割讓蘇聯，貝氏曰，美國接受協議之約束，已同意支持將該項土地讓與蘇聯，日後締結條約之時，彼將主張美國應股踐其諾言，而於條約內則入以上稱土地劃入蘇聯版圖之條文。記者有詢以倘於談判締結條約之時，有人提出反對，又將如何？貝爾納斯答稱：其時當可決定應採行之步驟。</p>
<h3 id="c5">外記者招待會　吳部長答問 <a href="#c5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>〔中央社重慶廿七日電〕外記者招待會今日午後三時舉行，由吳部長國楨，何司長鳳山主持，茲錄主要問答如次：</p>
<p>（問）蘇聯新聞廣播稱，最近重慶學生反對雅爾達密約及蘇對東北政策之遊行，係由中國政府協助或組織，請一述中國之官方態度如何？</p>
<p>（答）政府從未協助或組織學生之遊行，相反的事實，政府曾用各種方法，予以勸阻，凡目賭在重慶學生之遊行者，必能感覺完全出諸自動，且學生俱在，諸君可親往詢問。</p>
<p>（問）請詳確示知最近在京舉行之軍事會議之次議如何？</p>
<p>（答）是次會議，僅有兩項議題、就整編眾隊方面，決定就現有之　　二百七十三師編爲九十師，此項調整，約於五月底可完成，縮編後，將完成統一編制，此一工作，約需時六個月，另就整編後之編餘軍官土兵，商決就業安插辦法。</p>
<p>（問）前者王外長就有關東北蘇軍撤退間題，向蘇方提出詢問，中國政府已否接得答覆？</p>
<p>（答）政府至目前為止，尙未接到答覆。</p>
<p>（問）駐蘇大使傅秉常返渝，是否携有蘇方態度之聲明文件？</p>
<p>（答）傳大使數週前離莫斯科，赴英倫參加聯合國大會，是次乃逕由倫敦返渝，自無任何文件携返。</p>

<p>〔本報南京廿七日電〕政府公布開放外匯市塲，廢止官價外匯匯率，已引起此間金融界之密切反應。據某金融權威分析，當局此種非常措施，將有助於物價之平抑，今後外匯價格之漲落，胥視進出口爲決定，惟官價匯率廢止後，國際貿易商人不無感受威脅，是以在對外貿易上，或有多少影響。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市進出口商均在密切注視下星期一之外匯掛牌。怡和洋行某高級職員昨告記者稱：彼深信此後彼等之業務可望漸復正常，但仍極盼政府買賣外匯價格之差額相距不致過鉅。彼謂：即照目前規定之辦法，出口商已頗感周折，因彼等於墊付大宗現欵購得貨物之後，必須交由商品檢騐局檢騐，而此項工作頗費時日，檢騐完竣後，再電外國報價，需俟覆電到達後，始可憑電至指定經營外匯之銀行請求證明，然後報關輸出。此時期中所耗拆息，實已可觀，如於收到外匯外，於結價時再打一極大之折扣，則出口商所獲更微矣。彼之希望爲此項差額不超過一成。</p>

<p>〔聯合社孟買廿六日電〕前印度大會黨領袖尼赫魯，今日來孟買視察，損失情形，晚問在海濱沙灘上，向悲壯之羣衆十萬人至廿五萬人發表演說，籲請印度數百萬人民，由和平途徑趨向獨立，如有實行革命之必要，則正當領袖自能發出信號。對於「反革命分子」導領孟買人民發生流血暴動，尼氏曾痛加攻擊，但謂英國若不離開印度，印度之病患將不能治愈，並請「現在陸海空軍及警察隊中之每一個印度人，勿服從英人命令，向印度同胞開槍或加以傷害。至於歐慶萊司令於星期一晚廣播，發表官方政策，決定懲辦激成此次民衆流血暴動之譁變水兵罪魁。尼赫魯謂，祇須令陸海空軍能獲自由，亦可表示同意，「惟我人要求獨立，並非參加政治。歐慶萊所謂印軍應服從長官命令，而向一無防禦之印度同胞開槍，此言予未能苟同。關於印度水兵與英軍在加塞爾營房激戰一事，尼氏謂，以若輩僅屬天眞的孩子，且受種族歧視及非人道之惡劣待遇已久，故亦可與以寬恕。」尼氏演說係出談話口氣，歷時約九十分鐘。</p>

<h3 id="c39">聯合國大會傍聽記　旗鼓相當的兩位風雲人物　貝文·維辛斯基　康納利與曼紐易斯基也是一對老搭擋 <a href="#c39" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e39" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">39</a></h3>
<p>— 本報特約記者　余風寄自倫敦</p>
<p>聯合國大會初開時，好多人搖頭嘆息，他們並不是預料聯合國大會之必敗，而是感嘆大會裹缺少出色人物。尤其是新聞記者，更覺得具有新聞價値人物之稀少，因此異常懷念第一次戰後的「老虎總理」克里蒙梭，勞合喬治和威爾遜。</p>
<p>安全理事會開過兩次會後，大家的觀念就開始改變，認爲大會在製造歷史，也在製造風雲人物，及至大會結束，大家更是志得意滿，因爲這大會，非特有有聲有色的出色人物，而且在外交史上實在是一個劃時代的記錄。在這大會裏，淘汰了以前的所謂「外交辭令」，所有演說爭辯，全是開門見山，大刀闊斧，次非以前之扭扭揑揑，迂廻宛轉。</p>
<p>大刀闊斧針鋒相對</p>
<p>英國外交部長貝文，和艾登的作風全不相同。他並不講究衣飾，次不讓什麼禮服去束縛他自己。他是碼頭工人出身，有江湖豪俠之風，要說就痛痛快快的說。和蘇聯的外交委員會副委員長維辛斯基旗鼓相當。</p>
<p>維辛斯基在辯論裏次不讓人，他能講英語，但在會塲裏，他總用他本國的語言。他的話轉輾翻譯，也許已沒有原文精形，但在翻譯裏，還可以聽出他的機智聰明。</p>
<p>安全理事會接到的控訴案件中，第一件是伊朗控吿蘇聯，英國支持伊期。伊朗提出控訴後的翌日，蘇聯提出英軍在希臘，烏克蘭提出英軍在爪哇的「威脅世界和平。」最後又有叙利亞黎巴嫩提出駐在它們國內英法軍「危害和平」的伸訴。本文囑稿時，黎叙事件還正在討論未見頭緒但其他三案件都已討論完結。這三案件中，英蘇都是對立的主角，互相辯論，互相攻擊。因此開安全理事會，就是看貝文和維辛斯基鬥法。</p>
<p>倫敦多霧一語雙關</p>
<p>兩人鬥法的序幕，從討論軍事參謀會議的日期時開始，那時美國斯退丁紐斯提議二月一日開會，維　斯基說不能那麼確定，蘇聯軍　代表不一定能在一號趕到，「因爲，」他語帶雙關的說：「倫敦和莫斯科間氣候惡劣！」貝文次不讓人，笑着說：「但願蘇聯代表能在二月一日前把這些濃霧消除。」維辛斯基立刻推推舌人，叫他翻譯：「可是倫敦的霧總是比別的地方濃得多多！」</p>
<p>自此以後，兩個人時常交換着幽默的針鋒相對的對白。他們兩人，在安全理事會馬蹄形的桌子上，是貼身緊鄰。有時兩人相對搶白一場，又握手言歸於好。有一家倫敦報紙，畫着貝文維辛斯基赤膊執劍，在作中世紀時代的次鬥。</p>
<p>嘴湊耳朶隻字不漏</p>
<p>約辛斯基的私人解譯，坐在他身後，嘴湊着他的耳朶。貝文說一句，他在耳邊譯一句，所以貝文說的什麼，維辛斯基一字不漏，全然知曉，可以當塲作答。</p>
<p>討論希臘爪哇事件時，維辛斯基引證種種英國下議院辯論希臘爪哇事件時反對派的責難，那些下議員也有些說英國在干涉人家內政。他又引證英國報紙上的通訊，那　駐外記者也　　英國政府，認爲英軍支持的並不是革命政府。貝文一面話，一面抽烟，接着斜銜着香烟作答：「我們英國議會，可以自由發言，一件事，正反意見都有，我眞奇怪，維辛斯基先生對一面的意見，這樣熟悉，對另一面意見，却這樣生疏，明天我可以給你送一份議會紀錄，請你研究研究另一方面的意見。」</p>
<p>語涉報界開盡玩笑</p>
<p>「至於報紙，只是給人消閒解　的，（To　Amusc　to　Entertain.）有時且不免誤導讀者，（To　Mislead）我天天看報，因此，對報紙所說所載，也就不會這樣感到嚴重。」引起在座記者大笑。</p>
<p>第二天安全理事會開會時，維辛斯基說：「貝文先生竟會覺得報紙只是消閒解悶的東西，眞是有像報界尊嚴。傳遞消息，全靠報紙。像我們又沒有軍隊在外國，如不靠報紙，靠什麼情報？」接着，他又引證了一段英國每日先鋒報（Daily　Herald）的記載，笑着說：「對這份報紙，貝文先生該稍存敬意吧！」全體哄堂。因爲每日先鋒報是工黨機關報</p>
<p>貝文對此並未正面作答，只抽一口烟，笑笑說：「我懶得再和報紙開玩笑了。」</p>
<p>雙雙鬥法搥拳擊桌</p>
<p>他們兩人爭吵得緊張時，也搥拳拍桌，全塲鴉雀無聲。維辛斯基說話時，又愛用手勢，手執鉛筆，我常担心他會指到隔座的貝文臉上。貝文發言提到維辛斯基時，老愛兩眼釘着維辛斯基，而且發言時，嘴裏有時還　着香烟。</p>
<p>貝文雙頰的肌肉時常抽動，緊張時抽動更烈。維辛斯基說到激昻處，一絲笑意也沒有。一時就會陰雲密佈，似乎大風暴將臨。但就是在這陰暗局面下，他們總不忘記帶來一二點星星。有時緊張處，貝文突然會說：「我的朋友維辛斯基是法律學家，對條文當然很明白。」或是正磨拳擦掌間，維辛斯基又會笑嘻嘻的稱貝文爲Hot　Headed　Man。</p>
<p>貝文太太出席傍聽</p>
<p>因爲他們在安全理事會的種種精彩表演，弄得人人想旁聽安全理事會，小房間上下擠得沒法通風。理事會開會時，並不禁止抽烟，吞雲吐霧，又熱又悶。有一次會議時，因要拍攝電影，燈光通明，胖子貝文熱得滿臉是汗。</p>
<p>希臘問題討論時，貝文維辛斯基吵得最兇，但會後貝文去出席維辛斯基的鷄尾酒會，兩人談得比誰都投機，笑得比誰都開心。</p>
<p>貝文脣槍舌戰時，他太太也曾出席，許多代表的太太紛紛要旁聽證，似乎染了先生的習氣，對政治興趣特濃。</p>
<p>維辛斯基太太未來，他的女兒却與他偕來。在他的招待會席上，女兒是女主人。維辛斯基原籍波蘭，機警善辯，現在是莫洛托夫手下的第一紅人。</p>
<p>貝文在安全理事會開會期間，因爲他勇敢直言，聲望大增。在美國都是人人討論貝文。去聽理事會時，似乎就是去聽只文和維辛斯基抬槓。</p>
<p>另一搭擋半夜怒吼</p>
<p>在大會裏善於搭檔的，還不止貝文和維辛斯基兩人。還有另外一對老搭擋——鳥克蘭的曼紐易斯基和美國的上議員康納利。兩人都已鬚髮如銀，但是火氣大極。康納利聲音洪亮，發脾氣時更是聲嘶力竭。在小組委員會討論國際工會聯盟要參加聯合國大會問題時，康納利說：「現在倒要討論這件事，幹什麼我們美國工會要參加，就一聲不響的拒絕，眞是刮我們的鬍子!」主席是一位能言善語的比國外長史巴克。史巴克說：「我眞不懂爲什麼你要挿進這句話來！」康納利咆哮如雷：「你以爲我不知道？哼！有一批人在操縱這小紐會呢！」當時已午夜一時，大家想起此事，都認爲夜半怒吼。</p>
<p>咆哮下台握手言歡</p>
<p>大會結束時，又討論這事，先是曼紐易斯甚發言，一口好法文，認爲國際工會聯盟應該參加大會。演說甫畢，康納利立刻登台，大聲疾呼，左一聲曼紐易斯基先生，右一聲曼紐易斯基博士，問得曼紐易斯基也笑起來。康老先生越說越有勁，搥桌拍掌，幾乎把桌子也拍穿。咆哮完畢下台，他又和曼紐易斯基大握手，鬧得全塲大笑，他太太也在塲。可謂是聯合國大會中最精彩的壓台戲。也是這和平會議中最後的一塲戰鬥。（二月十五日寄自倫敦）</p>

<h3 id="c41">讀者意見　讀「如何籌措工業建設資金」後 <a href="#c41" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e41" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">41</a></h3>
<p>— 張毓珊</p>
<p>戰爭結東以後，各國均努力從事復興工作。中國爲產業落後之國，對此項復興事業，尤感股切。吾人深期中國在經濟建設方面，能迅速走向工業化之途徑。一國工業建建設，固須具備種種必要之基本條件，但資金之籌措，實佔首要。最近趙同運先生「如何籌措工業建設資金」一文（見本月十七日本報）曾有創設中國復興工業金融公司之建議，良以我國工業建設所需機械·材料·人力爲量基鉅，其所需長期資金，當非普通銀行組織所能供應，同時吾國對外匯率，一時不易確定，廠商向外訂購器材所需之外匯，不易結購，故擬創設中國復興工業金融公司，由國家銀行及主要商業銀行·信託公司·保險公司等，共同投資美金五億元及國幣五十億元，以作扶助工業復興之中心金融機構。此項議設之公司，並非創造性的建議，蓋英美諸工業先進國家，均有是項機構之設立，中國一切工業建設，尙在萌芽時期，故對於扶助工業復典之中心金融機構，更有迫切之需要。能實現至少有下列利益：</p>
<p>（一）解決工業建設所需之資金我國資金貧乏，工業建設所需長期資金及中期資金之籌措，最感困難。誠能有一中心金融機構統籌供應作合理與有效之運用，則此項困難，自可解決。</p>
<p>（二）吸收外資用於有利之生產各國在華投資，爲數甚鉅，但大部份用於不生產之途，故不僅與中國經濟之發展無所補益，凡使中國在政治與經濟方面，處於更不利之地位。中國復興工業金融公司之設立，一方面可引導外資絕對作生產建設事業之投資；同時可運用政府之力量，加强公司在外國之信用，則利用外資之數額與範圍，益形廣汎。</p>
<p>（三）輸入品之質的轉變復興工業金融公司，旣代理廠商向外國訂購工業建設所需材料，則吾國輸入之機械原料將大量增加。是項輸入商品之質的轉變，將爲吾國國際貿易史上劃一新紀元，其有利於國家經濟之繁榮殆無疑議</p>
<p>（四）加强穩定外匯之力量　吾國民間所持有之黃金，外幣債券及外匯，爲數至鉅。統個人言，此項持有之財，僅發生保持購買力之作用；就整個國家言，此項鉅量賣金，絲毫未發生有利於國家生產之作用。現旣有復興工業之中心金融機構，則民問持有之黃金，外幣債券，及外匯，均可作合理與有效之運用。</p>
<p>吾人確認創設中國復興工業金融公司之建議，在完成工業化的偉大經濟建設之過程中，實有其必然存在之價值。但中國幅員遼闊，各種工業建設之種類與範圍，至爲廣汎，是否以五億美元及五十億國幣之運用，即能完成此項百世之大業，故資本之數額，實有重行考慮之必要。</p>
<p>八年抗戰，民生凋敝，勝利以還，一切的生產事業，復陷於停滯狀態，吾人深感敵僞財產之處理，絕不能以財政收人爲唯一目標，應以維持及增加生產爲前提。「殺鷄取卵」爲智者所勿取。吾人深望財政當局，從遠處着眼，近處着手，當機立斷，先集中全力，斬破惡性循環之鎖鏈。庶幾中國復興工業金融公司之設立，當能促進工業建設，而獲增加生產之實效。</p>
<h3 id="c42">專論　抑平特價應採取之對策 <a href="#c42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>— 徐爾信</p>
<p>自和平勝利以來，各地物價，繼續上漲，尤以煨近農歷新年開市後，漲勢愈劇，如火如荼。凡握有黃金外幣股票及各種貨物者，均獲有暴利。其擁有游資者，紛向銀行提現，購買金鈔物資，爭先恐後，暗息暴騰至二以上，人心皇皇，社會呈露極度不安之現象，平民申吟憔悴，生活痛苦，達於極點。蔣主席在杭，聞訊特蒞滬召見金融工商界要人，指示抑平對策，可見　主席雖日理萬幾，固無時不關懷民瘼。在此物價高漲之際，滬上有識之士，有王張將政府所存黃金，儘量懸牌以官似拋售，藉以抑平金價，穩定物價。亦有主張黃金收回國有，使黃金不能作祟，失去領導物價之作用。實則物價上漲，有其自然與人爲之原因，牽涉政治金融貨幣財政生產消費交通運輸及居奇操縱等問題。金價漲固有刺激物價漲之可能，但究不能謂金價有確實領導一般物價之必然性。目前市場游資充斥、無適當歸宿之所，東西氾濫，數額甚鉅，以政府現存之黃金拋售，車薪杯水，勢難持續，倘一旦金盡策窮，則金價狂跳，此次重慶停止掛牌之所發生現象，不難重演。各地民間所有之黃金，雖乏精確統計，佔計數量必甚鉅，政府收回國有，即使其價格一部份搭配公價，一部給現，此項鉅額鈔幣之　發，勢必增加物價上升之度數，且美鈔亦可代黃金起而發生領導物價之作用。黃金收回國有之理論，在目前尚無實行之可能，且祗能視爲安定金融之一辦法，絕不能用爲仰止當前極複雜之物價問題的善良對策。作者認爲當前物價上漲，由於通貨數量之膨脹，物資之缺乏，與國民對法幣缺乏信仰之三大原因。</p>
<p>抑平物價，因此，必須於造成物價上漲兩個自然原人」三方面由政府與全體國民於整個方面，爲標本兼施之策，一致共同努力。否則僅局部辦理，頭痛醫頭，脚痛　脚，或政府諉過於小民，或人民非難於政府，其結果爲「扶得東來西又倒」甚或毫無成效可言。作者此論，持之甚早，今再將此項實施對策，分別重申於下：</p>
<p>（甲）關於「幣」的方而：（一）收縮通貨，在目前之中央銀行，雖尙不能採用提高貼現率及公開市場政策，以收縮通貨，但中央銀行旣處於「銀行之銀行」地位，且發鈔已有集中之趨勢，以後對於他銀行之拆放，固須愼重，即對政府之墊借，亦應有相當限制，務使多收少吐。對銀錢業頭寸之調度，並應嚴加監督，所有各行莊信用抵押等放款，隨時實施調查，防止用作投機方面。（二）整頓各項稅收，使之充裕，尤以直接稅之須認眞整頓，以轉移國民之購買力。並絕對查禁包稅制，嚴格剔除中飽，務使涓滴歸公。（三）裁撤駢枝機關並調整各級機構，使之合理化。裁减冗員，注重行政效能。暫時採用「與民休養」之政策，停止一切不急之務，務使收支達到平衡。（四）發行新公債或臨時庫券，强迫富戶承銷。（五）舉辦財富登記，所有各種有形無形之財富，均須一律登記，其戶名應以戶籍法所規定發給之國民身份證上之姓名爲限，不得有化名。此項財富之登記，可爲整頓直接稅極大之助力，並可爲派募公債之根據，合於賦稅負担能力之原則。（六）接收各地之敵僞工廠，按其資產，發行股票出售。並速成立合法之證券交易市場，引導游資趨於工商事業，納人正軌。（七）提倡儲畜或强迫國民儲蓄，或舉辦有獎儲蓄。（八）提高儲蓄存款利率，對信用活期存款，予以限制，並隨時調查其去路，以防游資作祟。（九）裁編軍隊，採精兵主義，所有編餘官兵，從事屯墾及工農，以增加生產。（十）凡有獨佔性及私人不能舉辦之企業，或由國營，或官商合辦，即以所入補助國庫之不足，或可吸收私人一部份游資。</p>
<p>（乙）關於「物」的方而：（一）恢復水陸交通，山日俘實行築路浚河工程，增加運貨舟車，以便利貨物之運輸。（二）公私工廠，限期一律開工，原有敵僞工廠，得屆用日籍技術員繼續負責。（三）獎勵私人投資於各種企業，並予以保本保息。（四）勞資應採協調原則，嚴禁政治性之罷工怠工行爲。（五）向外國貸欵，並供給各種金業適量之外匯，使購進必需之原料與機件，以擴充生產。（六）將接收敵僞封存倉庫之物資，普遍平賣，並防止爲好商壟斷漁利。（七）充分運輸煤斤，供給低廉之電力。（八）嚴禁各地類似　之通過稅，並實行取締一切苛雜。</p>
<p>（丙）關於「人」的方面：（一）安定人心，喚起國民對法幣發生信心，打破其重物輕幣之觀念，須由全國國民以「父敎其子兄勉其弟」之精神，一致共同努力，庶使法幣信用增强，價値提高。（坍發通貨，固能使物價上漲，但通貨流通加速，允易促成物價上漲。目前人民拋出法幣，搶購貨物，法幣流通甚速，即使收縮通貨，增產物資，實行能有成效，而一般國民，仍存輕賤法幣之觀念，物置仍須上漲，故增强法幣之信心，實爲提高法幣價値必備之條件。）。（二）取締投機如嚴禁黑市非法買賣，檢查倉庫物資，辦理登記，調查票據去路，查究有關金融謠言根源，懲辦投機操縱奸商，但此等消極辦法，僅能收一時之效果。（三）國內和平團結，並改良政治，使人民對政府發生擁護與敬仰，因而迎帶及於愛護法幣與信仰法幣。（四）政府當局在未能將金融政策（例如外匯率之決定）明白宣示以前，宜愼重言論，更不宜前後言論不符，或事後聲明否認，使投機者揣摩意旨，藉爲造謠取巧，投機牟利之機會。（五）提倡節約，實行耐勞忍苦，以免物資之浪費。</p>
<p>凡上所述各項實施對策，雖卑之無甚高論，如果政府與全國國民，共起而分別實行，物價上漲問題，不難迎刃解決，物價旣能逐漸下降，幣値因而穩固，民生獲得安定，則發行所謂「孫票」未免庸人自擾。願國人一致擁護國民政府，愛護並信仰國府發行之法幣，使其價値永久穩固，物價不生波動，共享康樂之生活。如有不惜破壞法幣之價値，動搖對法幣之信念，希圖因物價之上漲而獲取暴利，應視爲國民之公敵。</p>

<p>物資分配供應不敷</p>
<p>羅氏介紹亨德女士於各記者後，女士即發表談話，略謂：英國竭誠擁護聯總，而聯總撥助中國之六萬七千五百萬萬元中，英國所捐助者亦達一萬一千餘萬美元，約合總額六分之一。聯總前身，實即一九四一年十月在倫敦成立之「盟國戰後需求委員會，」而該會主席，即華人極爲熟悉之李滋羅斯爵士也。惟英國不欲一手捐助聯總，一手又向聯總索取援助，以供應馬來，緬甸，等地。故英國不得不另謀救濟之方，而負雙重捐助之責。目前此等國家中，物資分配，均經嚴密管制。但供應不足，已成主要困難。</p>
<p>特價高漲情形普遍</p>
<p>亨德女士旋答覆各記者之發問：略謂（一）工資標準不能趕上物價，已成爲各國普通悄形。對於本埠勞資爭執，因情形尙不甚明瞭，尙待研究。（二）每天自鐵路運往廣東之救濟品約一百噸至三百噸，但現已另備卡章五百輛，恊助運輸。（三）新加坡曾有罷工，香港勞資糾紛頗多，尤以碼頭工潮綿廷　二個月之久，但並未罷工·亨德女士頗關心上海報界情形，允注意紙張之缺之，彼謂英國最大之倫敦泰晤士報，目前亦僅出兩大張。</p>

<p>焓赤　昨以外匯市塲開放，且以貝氏就任中行總　，投機之風漸戢，而陪都方面，　有種種揣測，一般心理，對美匯仍看二千對一，黃金一三五萬，以致昨市美鈔較黃金遜色，晨開一四三萬，最低到一三七萬，趁低有剩餘資金吸收，（實貨收實貨，不計拆息，絕無投機作用，）一度回升至一五一萬，（賣買價拔開甚遠，混水撈魚，極難肯定，）無如美鈔未能跟上，反見退化，午刻仍降為一四〇萬有零，較前收跌去十五萬，午後美鈔退至二一〇〇元以下，喊價退至一四〇萬以下，交易稀少，已不廣泛，各號報價互異，一四〇萬大關出入不一，飾金無掛牌，紋銀二千元，銀元八五〇元左右，供過於求，息價仍在二角內外。</p>
<p>美鈔　昨因泰半心理者二千對一，市價尚高起一成，賣方尚覺有利可圖，晨開二二七〇元，賣方尚再接再厲，步降至二一〇〇元左右而後稍回，但二一五〇元以上仍難持久，午刻仍在二一〇〇元前後盤旋，較前收跌去三百元左右，港票雖應例外，（以美鈔二千對一算照英美匯兌推算港票應為五〇〇元，照港地黑市美鈔算應為三三〇元左右），但無論如何，買方終難振作，新貨更甚，結果老貨跌十元，新貨亦跌十餘元，交易岑寂。</p>

<h3 id="c77">女子有才便是德（上） <a href="#c77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>— 楊同芳</p>
<p>在「女子無才便是德」的這句所謂古聖賢「調言」之下，不知埋沒了多少女性的天才，不知剝奪了多少女子受敎育的機會。</p>
<p>數千年來，我國的女性，一直被可怕的舊禮敎的極梏束縛着，沒有一點自由。一般社會的統治者，以及身居士大夫階級的「鴻儒」之輩，爲了壓迫女性，奴化女性，首先不讓女子有受敎育的繼會，造成男女間知識的不平等。因爲知識的不平等，其他一切自然也都不平等了。女子的地位旣然不能和男子平等，從此她們便一直隸屬於男子，成爲男士掌握中的「玩物」，男子可以拿「貞操」這個名詞來窒塞女性情感的泉源，而男子却可以公開納妾，不受與論的制裁，誘姦遣棄的賣任男子可以不理。所以在封建社會中，女子是供男子隨便宰割的綿年。「女子無才使是德」這句數千年來奉爲天經地義的古聖賢「訓言」，更是那些衛道的「鴻儒」所用以牢籠女性的鐐銬，犧性在這下面的實在太多了。</p>
<p>早該廢棄的訓言</p>
<p>時代變了，這句「訓言」，似乎已經在無形中被淘汰了。在提倡男女平權的今日，在促進男女敎育機會均等的今日，我們自然不容許再讓這種思想存在。然而現在的中國社會，還表現着半封建色彩，一切不正確的傳統觀念，並沒有能完全根除。就像這句牢籠了數千年的中國女性的「訓言」，現在還有人認爲是眞理，一般自命爲倡導「賢妻良母敎育」的人，還拿這句早該廢棄的「訓言」做他們的思想根據。女子敎育在這五十年間的進步，我們不能否認，但是女子在知識上的地位還比不上男子，這中間固然有種種原因，可是有一點我們絕對無法否認，社會大多數的人對於受教育的目的看錯的很多，他們以爲女子受教育不過是一種點綴，一種裝飾。有幾個人相信女子讀書是爲了「學以致用」？有幾個人相信女子讀書可以在知識上取得和男子同樣的地位？「畢業證書爲粧奪之一」的觀念，似乎有很多人發生同感。</p>
<p>不要說在中國，就是德法諸國，他們的女子敎育不能不算發達，然面「到廚房去」喊成一片呼聲·美國的「新娘學校」專門供給未來的新娘關於治家敎予的知識，好像女子的「才」至多也僅能發展到廚房和新房。就事實說，女子的天性和職能，當然適宜於處置家務，然而在另一方面我們却不能不亟力擴大女子敎育的範圍。尤其在今日的中國，抗戰八年，終獲勝利，以後要踏上建國的前程，向建設新中國的大道邁進。我們需要無數的知識女性，和男子共同爲國家和社會服務，爲人羣謀福利。要達到這個目的，我們首先要改正一般人對於女子敎育的謬誤觀念，要在可能的範圍內，擴大敎育的目標，讓女性們可以自由地充實她們的知能，有滿足求知慾的機會。</p>
<p>適應和活的能力</p>
<p>我們要把「女子無才便是德」的這句反動口號取消了，換上一句「女子有才便是德」。在這裏，所謂「才」就是一個人的適應生活的能力，這是廣義的，包括一切日常生活的知識和技能。眞正的知識技能必頭配合着實踐才可以發生意義。理論和實際的打開一片，自然能够很適宜地順應一切自治，從而改善生活。這樣，由個人而社會，由小我到大我，一定可以把人類的世界推向光明的前程。就算丟開國家和社會來說，（實際上改善了個人也就改善了國家和社會），一個知識技能充實的女子，對於治家敎子之道，必定有更大的幫助，這是沒有問題的。怎樣使自己的家務處理得有條理，很適宜，怎樣使自己的子女受到良好的家庭敎養。（治家敎子男子自然也有責任），這些都須有充分的知能，不是隨便什麼人都僅得的。治家敎子，讓那些愚昧無知的女子去處理，決不會有辦法。何况國家和社會與個人的關係至深且切，今後的女性不是關在高樓上隸屬於男子的「玩物」了，她們應該是自覺的「社會的一員」，應該認淸自己對於社會乃至對於人羣所處的地位和責職。</p>
<p>有意衷腸的共同行爲</p>
<p>至於「德」，係泛指「道德」這側名詞。這裏面包括「德行」和「品格」。根據近世倫理學家的研究，道德的涵義極廣。過去人們所視爲道德的，現在已經失去時代的意義，不再有道德的價値了。當然人類也有共同的各觀的道德標準，可以有比較垂久的價値，然而道德總是社會的產物，時代的變遷和社會的進化，隨時可以改變人們對於道德的觀念。道德是一種行爲的規律，社會中各個分子，爲適應共同需要而發生一種有意識的共同行爲的規律，便是道德。在原始社會裏，都以爲道德出於神的命令，道德的觀念出於神的賜予。這樣道德便套上宗敎的外衣。民智日開，這德被認爲是「理性」的指示，人們在肉體之我以外，有一個「理性之我」，這說法雖然擺脫了宗敎「神」的色彩，然與現代論理觀念仍不相合。</p>
<p>美國心理學家費息爾（S.Fischir）謂個人道德的發展，常隨個人自我意識的發展而發展，由自我而擴大，道德觀念的範圍。個體的生長和環境的影響，是道德行爲形成的條件。據一般學者的分析，造成一種道德行爲首先須有高深的知識，做推理判斷的根據。蘇格拉底說：「知識就是道德。」西諺云：「大多數的苦難之來，由於無知者往往比由於惡意者爲多。」康德也說：「知識是一面鏡子，它照着我們的行爲。」的確，知識是很重要的，雖然我們也不能否認良好的習慣和堅强的意志力對於形成道德行爲的重要。</p>
<p>兒童</p>
<h3 id="c78">怎樣對付兒童 <a href="#c78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>— 閒</p>
<p>兒童天眞，天賦有服從心，並且小心田裏，大致存有「大人總比我知道得多些」的下意識。所以對他們的訓導或規勉，儘可出之於和藹的態度，所謂諄諄善導，次用不到聲色俱厲，有時過多的責駡，反使他們成爲「頑皮」了，或甚至倔强！</p>
<p>小孩生性善玩，有時弄得手臉骯髒不堪，這並不是他的過失。你應當於事後爲他們洗淸潔，並吿訴他說，汚穢的東西不可入口，吃東西之前應先洗手，下次他就會自己去洗了！</p>
<p>不要當着人面前，指斥他的不是，這會失去他的自尊心。</p>
<p>兒童遇有不懂的事而詢問，應當細爲答復，解釋；但是學堂裏帶回來的功課或習題，切不可代做，以免養成依賴性。</p>
<p>小兒吃藥，不要騙他說這是甜的，這是敎他欺騙，並且下次就不靈了—不如好好的勸他，說這吃下去病立刻會好，身體不難過了，效果反要好些。</p>
<p>不要輕易允許孩子們的要求，允許了不可忘了給與，養成他們守約的習慣。</p>
<p>慈愛是好的，但是過多了就變成寵愛。</p>
<p>不要給孩子穿太華麗講究的衣服，這會養成他奢侈。</p>

<p>英國糧食部長史密斯爵士爲優待孕婦領取配給的食物起見，特規定孕婦的配給證上加印「排隊優先權」（Queue　Priority＇Please）字樣。孕婦得到這種配給證，在倫敦商店前排隊的時候，有排到前面去的權利。</p>

<p>— 劍如</p>
<p>當此一切物價高漲漫無止境的社會中，每個家庭總是憂慮着生活艱難，不時的打量着怎樣「開源」？怎樣「節流」？新生活運動的標語中有一條是：「勤以開源，儉以節流。」自然，能够利用廢物，積年累月的計算，他的數目倒也不小呢！現在我寫幾件可利用的廣物在後：</p>
<p>（一）肥皂頭　用剩的肥皂頭，把它收集起來，積得多了，以皂頭溶解在豬油中，加些食鹽，煎熬成糊狀，倒在模中，待凝結後，取出切開又成肥皂·</p>
<p>（二）破布　破衣服或零碎的布條，積存起來，可以理了紥成拖糞。市上所買的，也是破布做成的。</p>
<p>（三）　殼　義殼可作染料，只要把吃下的　　，加些綠　，放在鍋中，用水煎之，便可染元色衣料。</p>
<p>（四）舊皮芏底　破舊的皮鞋底，很可利用，把它改做女鞋底或小孩鞋底很適當。</p>
<p>（五）稻草灰　每天燒下的灰，看他一無所用，但是利用他來楷擦銅鍋器，能使舊的變成新的。或者泡成汁，用汁水來洗衣服，他的功用，可像肥皂一樣，可以去汚；又可作肥料。</p>

<h3 id="c81">自製小斗蓬 <a href="#c81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>— 蒼梅</p>
<p>小孩穿衣裳是很浪費的。我們找件奮大衣，用點功夫就可改成一件合用而又經濟的時行服裝。現在很流行穿斗蓬，我覺得小女孩穿斗蓬很方便。因爲冬天穿了棉袍，如果再加大衣，必顯臃腫。斗蓬則簡便而瀟灑。</p>
<p>圖中的斗蓬尺寸（英尺），合適於五六歲小女孩穿的。</p>
<p>材料：最好是呢羢料。如果利用舊衣服，只要反一面熨平，做起來就同新的一樣。鑲　全身領圈及出手的材料，撮好用斜方格或棄色而鮮艷的。可以把一件平凡的暗色的料子襯托起來。至於襯裏等都可用舊的東西。</p>
<p>製法：依圖中尺寸剪裁，打摺及通合處先用針綫縫合，然然依照有綫點的地方機器軋好。前面分左右將兩塊聯和，然後縫成一斗蓬形，將帽子安好、做兩塊襯肩（縫成餃子狀，內襯棉花墊於肩頭處，然後將襯裏安好。（襯裏剪裁可以簡單些，後面可做一平塊剪，不必打褶；前面可將兩塊拼成一塊剪）。全身做完，最後鑲上滾邊。全身連　潦邊約八十二吋長，袖開口滾邊五吋長，領口處釘鈎扣，並釘兩圓扣，加一扣圈扣起，即成一簡便合用的斗蓬。諸位不妨先將大人的舊衣試做一件，尺寸可按小製大小加以放大或縮小。</p>

<h3 id="c82">消耗生命的「麻將」 <a href="#c82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>— 溯因</p>
<p>「麻將」，是件消耗生命的玩意兒！因爲「時間是造成生命的東西」（富蘭克林語），所以消耗時間就是消耗生命，而搓麻將是最消耗時間的，因此也就最消耗生命的。</p>
<p>我國的社會上一直呈着這一種矛盾的現象，那就是「人無事做，事無人做」，搓麻將就是人無事做的現象最普遍的一種。當然，這種現象的發生不是由於眞的無事做，而是不知做與不肯做。這是一種很可怕的現象。明之亡於馬吊麻將的前身，這一回中國遭受了空前的刧難，麻將也未始無功。因爲搓麻將之風在過去數十年可說是猖獗已極，胡適之先生曾統計過，全國每日消耗於搓麻將的時間，至少有十六萬七千日！試想這許多的時開如果用來做了別種有益於社會，家庭或個人的事情，它的成就不是很可觀了嗎？積之一年，數十年，它的成就不更可驚了嗎？自然，這些成就的果積，就是社會的進步，國家的强盛。如今把這如許可貴的時間消耗在搓麻將上，所得到的結果當然是相反的，而國難的發生也就不是偶然的了。</p>
<p>然而更令人痛心的，在此由於盟邦的合作而獲得了抗戰勝利的今日，正當每一個國民都應該肩負起一份建國工作的時候，搓麻將之惡風依然普遍流行於上，中，下各社會階層中！</p>
<p>而且，搓麻將不僅是浪費時間而已，更會養成人的僥倖心，自私心，和影響親友間情感。更壞的是因患得患失，使人心理失常。當贏了的時候，得意忘形，想把儻來之財來作樂一下，於是吃，喝，玩種種惡習便開始造成了；若是輸了呢，便垂頭喪氣，藉端使性，寢食不安地的要想去「翻本」；幸而將本翻回，若從此洗手不幹，那還好，但由於他補償心理（補償一點精神上的損失）的作用，他不肯就此罷手，而想再贏一點；但如果又　了點，他會從此罷手嗎？不會的，因爲他又生了得隴望燭的心。這樣，輸了固想翻本，贏了又想再贏，循環不已，他永遠不能自拔了。這是從事任何種賭博的共同心理，固不祇搓麻將爲然。</p>
<p>可是這種傷神費時的玩意兒不但男人愛玩，而女人玩得更起勁，因爲男人總得出外做事，女人呢，有閒階級的太太，奶奶，小姐們，固然可以把全部家事交托給傭僕，把全副精神全部時間貢獻於搓麻將而不成問題，就是中下家庭中的主婦，沒有傭僕可交托她們的家務，孩子的，她們也會以極「經濟」的辦法來處理：她們會買些點心來省却一番舉炊的麻煩；會把骯髒的衣被堆積不先；讓室內的塵灰厚積起來不加掃除，什物凌亂不加整理、，讓孩子們在馬路上游蕩，衖堂裏打架，惡作劇，不加管束，敎育，而騰出時間來從事搓麻將。我眞有點不明自，「麻將」這東西竟會如此使人着魔！</p>
<p>但賭博之者，我相信什九都懂得，他們乃是明知而故犯，所以這不是甚麼言語文字的規勸所能奏效。這必須另找建設性的消遣與娛樂來取而代之。因爲我國人由於思想的不進步，敎育水準之低，一向缺乏良好的好癖，如歐美人所愛好的各種球戲，游泳，族行，讀書，集郵，秦樂之類；同時又因環境關係，正當的消遣與娛樂受到限制，如缺乏公園，運動塲，圖書館等以及各種業餘的團體組織。所以麻將一物便得時地之宜，而成了普遍的嗜好品。</p>
<p>筆者久以爲要革除家庭婦女搓麻將的惡風，必須靠團體的力量。最好是由每一里衖中的智識婦女領導組織一種國體，如聯誼社之類，以一里衖或一條衖裏的婦女爲組織對象——組織範圍不妨小，小則易於辦理。會所內備點書報雜誌，娛樂器具等，時常舉行演讀或座談和作家庭訪問，以灌輸婦女們以各種必需的知識，如家事，衛生，兒童心理及敎養，婦女自身的修養等等。有時相約作集體旅行或參觀，有時舉行有敎育意義的展覽，逢到節日更不妨開個游藝會，音樂會之類。總之，凡足以增進婦女們的智識，增加她們正當的興趣的，都可以推陳出新的來一下，藉以提高她們的智識水準，培養她們高尙的好癖，糾正她們不良的生活方式，而達到革除　麻將的惡風的目的。</p>

<h3 id="c83">蘇聯的尿布問題 <a href="#c83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>— 蕭淑莊譯</p>
<p>我眞是喜不自勝，太太生了個兒子。</p>
<p>這個在產科醫院裏降生人世的小把幾，當他可以回家時，最需要的東西是什麼呢？顯然的，是尿布。</p>
<p>最先，產科醫院給寫了張證明書，證明孩子生下來是活的。</p>
<p>「你到婦女檢騐室去領取他的尿布呢，」他們這樣的告訴我。到了檢騐室，他們說：</p>
<p>「你得要有一張你現在往所的房東寫來的居住證明書；領尿布時還要有一張代領保證書」。</p>
<p>「誰來保證我呀」？我驚訝的問，「這個嬰兒嗎？」</p>
<p>「母親可以出代頒保證書，」這是他們的回答。</p>
<p>於是我跑去找房東，再跑回到產科醫院收集這些證明書。</p>
<p>我又回到檢騐室，這次三張證明書換來了一張新的證明書。承他們的慈悲吿訴我說：</p>
<p>「把它送到你太太做工的地方去吧。」</p>
<p>到了太太做工的地方，我的兒子就被登記上。現在，我備有了紀錄片，證明書等，我就到發配給證的分區辦審處去。在那裏，我領到一張領尿布的卡片。</p>
<p>我手裏舉起這張小小的綠色的卡片，禁不住想到：假若有人想出一人好主意，使尿布不至少尿布配給證—直接的就從產科醫院供給的話，那時這一批仁慈的先生們還有點什麼事情可做呢？</p>
<p>在我的兒子降世後第七天，他　上了新的屍布，就被許可出院了。出院時，他們遞給我一張小紙條，說：</p>
<p>「這兒是你領肥皂的證明書。」</p>
<p>小傢伙已經兩個多月了，那張領肥皂證明書方才變成一塊肥皂。它並沒有被　放　。這張證明書先跑到房東處，從那裏被指引到婦女檢騐室，再回到房東處。然後跑到母親做工處，從那裏到發配給證分區辦事處，從那裏父到父親做工處，然後又回到撥配給證分區辦事處，最後再回到產科醫院。</p>
<p>並不是這紙證明書。已會向這些地方跑來跑去，是做爸爸的陪它一齊去的。這就是爸爸們的用處。</p>
<p>在那證明收的反面，印有　樣的聲明：「肥皂配給證應直接由產科醫院內領取。配給證分區辦事處處長庫資奈左夫印。」就在這下面我們又看到「將此證明書交於領取其他配給證之　關，即可頓得肥皂配給證。（簽字，模糊不清）」</p>
<p>然而到底們領到了那塊肥皂不過我却保留了這張證明書。等到我的兒子長大成人能去做事時，我要把這小片紙頭給他看，並對他說，「孩子呀，把它撕了吧！記着，在你一生中，絕不要頒發這種的證書或是寫出這樣的聲明。你要待你的同胞們像人類呀！」</p>
<p>上文譯自一九四六年正月號讀者文摘，原著者　Yefirn　Urhunsky。抗戰期內，在淪陷區的同胞們都嘗盡了敵僞政府下配給制度的苦。爲了生活的壓迫，物價的高漲，不得不忍氣吞聲的被支使來支使去的這裏填張表格，那裏領張配給票，手續眞是繁多。做主婦的更是頭痛不盡，什麼米票，麵票，糖票，油票，煤球票，布票等等都要時時記得該物何時到何處去領取，又要擠又被軋，不是白跑就是花了錢領到些不能吃不能用不夠分兩的東西。讀了此文，使我十分同情這位蘇聯著者的經歷。</p>
<p>隨筆</p>
<h3 id="c84">懷念 <a href="#c84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>— 淑儀</p>
<p>和孩子們生活在一起，眞是人生的樂事。望着他們天眞活潑的舉止，以及無所掛慮的臉龐，以乎使我年輕了不少。有時候，心中明明受了塵世間的擾攘，沉溺於愁悶的深淵中，可是一見到也門的親切可愛，就會烟消雲散的。跟他們天天共同學習，似乎自己又重返昔日的黃金時代。</p>
<p>在孩子們的心目中，我像是皇帝一樣的尊嚴。我的話就是孩子們的法律。他們的生活情感隨着我的意志而轉變，我像活在自已所造成的世界裏。雖然，過着　梗的孩子，常常竭思盡慮心緒不寗，不過事後，什麼都不在心上，正像在家裏同兄弟們生氣後的和解；要是結果能看見他們的行爲或學業漸漸向前的話，那末心中的愉澤眞無可言喩，會以這孩子格外的珍貴。</p>
<p>如今，病使我離開他們已快二年了；二年的隔閡更增依戀，我懷念着他們無一個，他們亦一定不會遺忘了我。要是將來身體和環境能應許的話，我還是願意再幹這舊業，和天眞的孩子們相處，過辛苦而溫馨的學校生活。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Our Country Has Expressed Its Basic Position; The Gloom Over the Northeast May Clear; The Seriousness of Military Conflict Has Also Diminished <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Hankou on the 27th] Premier Song, when passing through Hankou, told people that the Northeast problem should be resolved soon, and hoped that the people of the country would not worry too much.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Beiping on the 26th] A qualified person told reporters that the heavily overcast Northeast sky will soon have hope of clearing up. Although President Chiang's meeting with Wedemeyer, Eisenhower's inspection of the Pacific coast, General Keelen's visit to China, and Marine Corps Commander General Locky's trip to Pearl Harbor have all increased the heavy feeling about the Northeast problem, practically speaking, the current situation is already slightly better than before. (1) After this problem was made fairly public, China's basic position and attitude have been more easily recognized by the Soviet Union. The final plan that Chiang Ching-kuo took to Moscow may be given considerable importance by the Soviet Union. (2) The recently signed military reorganization plan includes the Northeast region, which has greatly reduced the severity of military conflicts in the Northeast and has the potential for a fundamental solution. (3) Although the official side still suspects whether the East Mongolian delegation has international or party affiliations after arriving in Beiping, their statement that they seek autonomy within the Republic of China has slightly calmed the storm brought about by the initial information obtained by the official side. Therefore, the situation in the Northeast has the hope of becoming clearer. The spokesperson also told reporters that personnel from the Changchun Railway Company had flown from Chongqing to Beiping a few days ago and will transfer to Changchun in the next day or two, which proves that the Northeast problem has not deteriorated to the extent it did on November 17th of last year. Zhang Jia'ao will come to Beiping shortly to convey the central government's intentions and then transfer to the Northeast. Official figures all believe that Zhang Jia'ao's visit to the north will symbolize that the government has a solution to the Northeast problem, but some also say: if the Northeast deteriorates to the point where a second Changchun evacuation is necessary, Zhang Jia'ao will still go to be the host of the evacuation.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Changchun on the 26th] The Northeast problem has now reached an extremely important stage. Although this is purely a diplomatic problem, some people often mix it with domestic politics, and the actions of these people often shift with diplomatic developments. The complexity of the problem lies here, and the danger lies here as well. There are many Eighth Route Army soldiers in various parts of the Northeast. Some of them came from Shandong in recent months, and most of the rest were organized locally. Their strength is greatest in the east, and they are also scattered along the Changchun Railway line. The train from Panjin to Dalian has Eighth Route Army checkpoints ten miles outside Shenyang, checking the passengers in the train. Trains between Shenyang and Changchun are also often checked in the Tie岭 area. The checkpoint between Changchun and Harbin is in Dehui. Their relationship with the Soviet army seems to be non-interfering on the surface, but they are sometimes often driven out by the Soviet army. Taking the takeover of Jiutai County as an example, when the county magistrate Qiao Guifang first went to take over, the local Eighth Route Army and the Soviet army were mixed together. The Soviet city defense commander suggested that Qiao negotiate with the Eighth Route Army, but Qiao insisted on taking over from the Soviet army, and thus returned without results. When he took over for the second time, the Soviet army had ordered the Eighth Route Army to withdraw in advance. Yang Hualei, the Eighth Route Army county magistrate, left a letter to Qiao, saying that the retreat was in accordance with the resolution of the Political Consultative Conference and was by no means a show of weakness. Later, when Qiao took over the Yingchengzi coal mine in the county, the Soviet army commander even forced the Eighth Route Army to withdraw more than 50 kilometers away and set a deadline of March 1, with no objection from the Eighth Route Army, but when the National Army advanced, they did not hesitate to risk their lives to resist. Currently, the fighting in the Faku area northwest of Shenyang is fierce, with casualties on both sides. An encounter battle also once occurred in Nongan County after the takeover. In addition, administrative agencies have now been established in all provinces and counties where the Eighth Route Army is located. It is said that the administrative leaders are all elected by the people. They also plan to invite Kuomintang members to participate to form a united front. It is claimed that this is based on the resolution of the Political Consultative Conference, but they rarely mention the decision to exclude the Northeast. These events have mostly occurred recently. The Eighth Route Army in the Northeast has only been around for the past six months. When the takeover personnel arrived here last year, it was still brewing, but now it is everywhere, and the speed of development is astonishing. It is generally believed that the existence of these facts has already added many difficulties in diplomacy, but if diplomacy and domestic politics are completely separated, then a solution is very easy. Currently, the focus of the problem is still on diplomacy, but this diplomacy must be conducted openly, reversing the past practice of acting secretly. I believe that if diplomatic activities here had been conducted in an open manner from the beginning, then the situation would not have become so complicated today. Also, regarding the Fushun incident, it has never been made public here, and most people are unaware of this tragedy, which easily leads to the misunderstanding that the people have lost heart. In the reporter's observation, although the current Northeast problem is extremely serious, if we accept past experience and find a good way to solve it, it is not impossible to break the deadlock immediately. However, the issue of tidying up after this deadlock is broken, especially the issue of selecting the people to engage in this tidying-up work, must be reconsidered.</p>
<h3 id="e2">Chief of Staff of the Soviet Army in Changchun Declares That the Withdrawal Is in Progress and Hopes to Complete It Before the American Army Leaves China <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>[TASS Changchun, 26th] Lieutenant General Drozd, Chief of Staff of Marshal Linovsky, held a press conference today and issued the following statement: "In view of the various inaccurate reports in Chinese and foreign newspapers that distort the true situation of the Soviet army's delayed withdrawal from the Northeast, the headquarters of Marshal Malinovsky intends to clarify this situation." "The withdrawal of the Soviet army began in November 1945, but was temporarily suspended due to the first and second requests of the Chinese government, extending to February 1. On January 15, 1946, the Soviet army resumed its withdrawal, which is still in progress, and a considerable number of Soviet troops have already left the Northeast." "However, the reason why the withdrawal of the Soviet army has been slightly delayed is because the Chinese government troops have been extremely slow to move into the areas vacated by the Soviet army. As a result, in many cases, the Soviet army did not know who to hand over the land to. In this regard, one thing is worth noting, that is, last fall, the Chinese government had repeatedly protested to the Soviet army command that the Soviet army was withdrawing before the Chinese government troops arrived." "The Soviet army command had to pay attention to this situation. In addition, it must be kept in mind that a large part of the railways and vehicles in the Northeast had been destroyed by the defeated Japanese army that had been hit by the Red Army. The lack of coal and the winter conditions in the Northeast, on the whole, have created serious obstacles to normal railway transportation." "Finally, along the transportation routes, especially along the railway routes, bandits formed by the remnants of the Japanese puppet troops continue to be active and carry out attacks, thus hindering the free movement of the Soviet army." "The Northeast Soviet Army Command expects to complete the withdrawal of the Soviet army before the US military command can withdraw the US military in China, or in any case, no later than this time. Therefore, all the news in some Chinese and foreign newspapers that the Soviet army deliberately delayed its withdrawal from the Northeast are slanders and fabrications by anti-Soviet, reactionary, and anti-democratic elements, the purpose of which is to shake the Chinese people's trust and goodwill towards the Red Army that liberated them from the enslavement of the Japanese imperialist bandits in Manchuria."</p>
<h3 id="e3">The Soviet Union Has No Special Rights to Transport Industrial Equipment in the Northeast; The US Secretary of State Denies That There Was an Agreement <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 26th] US Secretary of State Byrnes (see picture) denied at a press conference this afternoon that any tripartite agreement stipulated that the Soviet Union could take away machinery or factory equipment in Northeast China. When asked by reporters whether the Secretary of State knew of any group power country that wanted to undermine the unity of the Four Powers, he answered solemnly that the Four Powers would definitely continue to cooperate in peacetime, as they had in wartime.</p>
<p>[US News Agency, Washington, 26th] Secretary of State Byrnes announced at a press conference today that he had not received any reports of the withdrawal of the Soviet occupation forces from Manchuria. He made this statement in response to a reporter's question, based on news from London that Moscow Radio broadcast that most of the Soviet occupation forces in Manchuria had withdrawn. A reporter said: The commander of the Soviet army in Shenyang had said that the removal of heavy industrial equipment from a dozen factories in Shenyang by the Red Army was based on an agreement of the Big Three. The reporter then asked if there was such an agreement? Byrnes replied: As far as he knows, there is no such agreement. Another reporter asked whether the Chinese side had notified the US government of the Soviet army's transportation of materials. He replied no. Byrnes further denied that the US government had obtained reports from its own agencies or from the Chinese and Soviet sides that the Soviet Union had demanded commercial privileges in Manchuria other than the railway and port agreements of Lushun and Dalian.</p>
<h3 id="e4">The United States Has Agreed to the Soviet Union's New Annexed Territory <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>A reporter asked the Secretary of State whether the Soviet Union's annexation of the Kuril Islands and Southern Sakhalin into its territory violated the following method, that is, all enemy territories permanently disposed of should be carried out at the peace conference, and should not be done by unilateral action. And is this a precedent for the United States to obtain defense bases in the Pacific? Byrnes replied: As he said, according to international law, all territorial concessions should be made in the form of treaties. According to international law, if one wants to make a certain land recognized by others, then one can only follow the treaty procedure, which may be voluntary, or as in the case of defeated countries, passive. Mr. Byrnes replied to a reporter's question whether he did not intend to recognize the above-mentioned areas ceded to the Soviet Union unless a treaty was signed. Mr. Byrnes said that the United States is bound by the agreement and has agreed to support the transfer of the land to the Soviet Union. When the treaty is concluded in the future, he will advocate that the United States should fulfill its promise and include the above-mentioned land into the territory of the Soviet Union in the treaty. A reporter asked what would happen if someone objected during the treaty negotiation? Byrnes replied: At that time, one can decide what steps to take.</p>
<h3 id="e5">Press Conference for Foreign Reporters: Minister Wu Answers Questions <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 27th] The press conference for foreign reporters was held at 3:00 pm today, hosted by Minister Wu Guozhen and Director He Fengshan. The main Q&amp;A is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>(Q) Soviet news broadcasts have stated that the recent student protests in Chongqing against the Yalta Secret Agreement and the Soviet Union's policy towards the Northeast were assisted or organized by the Chinese government. Please state China's official attitude.</p>
<p>(A) The government has never assisted or organized student protests. On the contrary, the government has used various methods to dissuade them. Anyone who has witnessed the student protests in Chongqing must feel that they are completely spontaneous, and the students are all there, so you can go and ask them in person.</p>
<p>(Q) Please explain in detail the results of the recent military conference held in Nanjing.</p>
<p>(A) There were only two agenda items for this conference. In terms of reorganizing the troops, it was decided to reorganize the existing 273 divisions into 90 divisions. This adjustment will be completed around the end of May. After the downsizing, a unified organization will be completed. This work will take about six months. In addition, the employment and placement of the surplus officers and soldiers after the reorganization was discussed.</p>
<p>(Q) Foreign Minister Wang previously raised questions to the Soviet side regarding the withdrawal of Soviet troops from the Northeast. Has the Chinese government received a reply?</p>
<p>(A) The government has not received a reply to date.</p>
<p>(Q) Does Ambassador to the Soviet Union Fu Bingchang bring back a statement of the Soviet side's attitude?</p>
<p>(A) Ambassador Fu left Moscow a few weeks ago to go to London to attend the United Nations General Assembly. This time, he returned directly from London to Chongqing, so he did not bring back any documents.</p>

<h3 id="e8">Gold Prices Continue to Fall in Nanjing and Shanghai <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Nanjing on the 27th] Gold prices in Nanjing continued to fall this afternoon due to weak prices in Shanghai, falling by 140,000.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Chongqing on the 27th] This morning, the opening price of gold bars was 142,000 yuan at the highest, and the closing price was 140,000 yuan. The closing price of ingots was 137,000 yuan. The highest price of US dollars was 2,040 yuan, and the closing price was 2,020 yuan.</p>
<p>[United Press International, Beiping, 27th] The Beiping authorities today ordered the suspension of gold and silver bar transactions. Military police were ordered to go to registered and black market firms to remove telephones.</p>
<p>[Local News] The market prices of gold, US dollars, and securities in this city fell further yesterday. Gold once fell to 138,000 yuan, and the US dollar fell even more sharply, once reaching a low of 2,070 yuan. Other bond and stock markets were also uniformly weak and unable to rise. According to financial circles, the black market gold price once rose to a peak of 75 US dollars equivalent to one tael of gold. According to today's market price, it has fallen to 66.3 US dollars equivalent to one tael. However, the official price of gold in the United States is only 35 US dollars per tael. Although there are also slight signs of a black market, the distance is not very large. Therefore, the black market gold price in this city is much higher than the US market. If the price of US dollars tends to fall or gradually stabilizes in the future, then the price of gold will also gradually fall.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Hankou on the 26th] Grain prices in Hankou have fallen back, with each dan falling by about 5,000 yuan. The municipal government has also invited relevant agencies to form a Civil Food Adjustment Committee to suppress the rising trend.</p>

As for the firms engaged in foreign exchange business, in addition to some "designated banks" that have yet to be designated and announced, other banks, silver firms, money shops, travel agencies, and brokers that have been approved to operate must go through application procedures. The application forms required are divided into two types: firms and brokers. They are currently being rushed to be printed and will begin accepting applications for registration from next week for a period of 15 days. If approved after review, an operating permit will be issued as proof of business.</p>
<p>According to a Reuters report from New York on the 26th, China's move to stabilize the value of the legal tender may be related to the negotiation of a large loan from the US Export-Import Bank to develop China's export trade. Unofficial rumors here say that the new exchange rate may be 1,000 legal tender to 1 US dollar.</p>

<p>[Special Dispatch from Nanjing on the 27th] The government's announcement of the opening of the foreign exchange market and the abolition of the official exchange rate has aroused close reactions in financial circles here. According to an analysis by a financial authority, this extraordinary measure by the authorities will help to stabilize prices. In the future, the rise and fall of foreign exchange prices will depend on imports and exports. However, international traders feel threatened after the abolition of the official exchange rate, so there may be some impact on foreign trade.</p>
<p>[News from This Newspaper] Importers and exporters in this city are closely watching the foreign exchange listing next Monday. A senior official of Jardine Matheson told reporters yesterday that he firmly believes that their business is expected to gradually return to normal in the future, but he still hopes that the difference between the government's buying and selling prices of foreign exchange will not be too large. He said that even according to the current regulations, exporters already feel quite troubled, because after they have paid a large amount of cash to purchase goods, they must be submitted to the Commodity Inspection Bureau for inspection, which takes a lot of time. After the inspection is completed, they will then telegraph foreign price quotations. They need to wait for a reply before they can use the telegraph to request proof from the bank designated to conduct foreign exchange business, and then declare and export. The interest lost during this period is actually considerable. If a very large discount is given at the time of settlement after receiving foreign exchange, then the profits obtained by exporters will be even smaller. His hope is that this difference does not exceed 10%.</p>

<h3 id="e19">Spanish Problem Serious: U.S. Sends Note to Britain Saying Franco Regime Must End; Britain Does Not Approve of France's Actions <a href="#e19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>[This Newspaper Report] London, 27th Radio: The British government received a note from Washington today stating: The Spanish Franco regime must be ended immediately. The British government is considering this note. Also, the British Trades Union Congress issued a declaration today requesting that Britain and the United States sever diplomatic relations with the Spanish Franco regime.</p>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 27th] Three thousand French people gathered at the Vélodrome d'Hiver today, and in a furious mood, burned the portrait of Spanish dictator Franco and cheered the declaration of the closure of the French-Spanish border. The crowd demanded the complete severance of diplomatic relations with Spain.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 27th] The French government decided yesterday to close the border between France and Spain starting next Friday and sent a new note to Britain and the United States, reiterating France's view that the current situation in Spain "endangers international security." At the same time, the British government urgently telegraphed Sir Mallet, the British ambassador to Spain, instructing him to investigate in detail the execution of ten Spanish Republicans in Madrid last week.</p>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 27th] The French government decided today that if the United States and Britain still intend to maintain economic and diplomatic relations with the Spanish Franco government, it is prepared to submit the French opposition to the Franco regime to the United Nations Security Council for discussion. It is expected that French Foreign Minister Bidault will ask Britain and the United States to support France on the diplomatic front and jointly sever all relations with Spain. In addition, according to news from Hendaye: It is rumored that the Spanish authorities closed the French border this morning, 48 hours earlier than the French announcement of the closure. The French cabinet has now decided that all railway, road, postal, and telecommunications traffic between France and Spain will be effectively cut off starting at midnight on March 1st, when the trade agreement signed between the two countries in September of last year expires.</p>
<p>[United Press, London, 27th] A spokesman for the British Foreign Office stated today that he did not approve of the French government's order to close the French-Spanish border. It is said that such incidents may prolong Franco's regime, making the Spanish leader a "national hero" rather than a traitor. However, Britain also hates Franco and hopes that a government supported by the Spanish people will emerge.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 27th] Radio Paris reported that less than twelve hours after the French cabinet decided to close the French-Spanish border, the West ordered that Spanish troops on the Spanish-French border were not allowed to take leave. However, this information has not been confirmed by Western sources. The French cabinet reiterated its views in a letter to the British and American governments, stating that France believes that the current situation in Spain constitutes a condition that endangers international security.</p>
<p>[United Press, Madrid, 27th] Spanish newspapers today published for the first time detailed news of the French government's decision to close the French-Spanish border and its efforts to persuade Britain and the United States to sever diplomatic relations with Spain, and published lengthy commentaries denouncing the French Communist Party and the Soviet Union.</p>

<p>[United States Information Service, Washington, 26th] The Far Eastern Commission held its first meeting today in the dining room of the former Japanese Embassy. Representatives from eleven countries attended: the United States, China, Britain, the Soviet Union, France, Australia, Canada, the Netherlands, India, New Zealand, and the Philippines. U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes delivered the opening remarks (see yesterday's newspaper). Subsequently, U.S. Representative Lieutenant General McCoy was unanimously elected as the permanent chairman of the commission, and former U.S. Ambassador to China Johnson was elected as the secretary-general of the commission. The agenda included credentials, commission membership, election of the chairman and secretary-general, organization of the secretariat, preparation for the commission's work, reports on visits to Japan, and other informal matters.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 27th] The Far Eastern Commission held its first meeting yesterday and passed a proposal by Indian Commissioner Bajpai to establish an organizing guidance committee composed of the British representative Sansom, the Indian representative Bajpai, and the Soviet representative Novikov, so that the trial of Japanese war criminals could proceed as quickly as possible. U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes read out at the meeting the draft rules of procedure for the Far Eastern Commission agreed upon at the Moscow Conference of the Three Foreign Ministers. Australian Representative Eggleston protested first, believing that a final decision could not be made without soliciting the opinions of all commissioners. New Zealand Representative Berendsen also opposed the veto power of the U.S., China, Britain, and the Soviet Union. Philippine Representative Romulo also protested because he was not involved in Southeast Asia and Vietnam. Chairman McCoy said that the committee could consider any event it chose, but there was a distinction between discussion and action. Yesterday's meeting was held in the dining room of the former Japanese Embassy.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Canberra, 27th] Australian Foreign Minister Evatt announced yesterday that Paul, a former lecturer in political economy and Australian representative to the San Francisco Conference, has been appointed as the representative of the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, and India to the Four-Power Control Commission for Japan. The fact that this position is held by an Australian proves that Britain and other countries of the Commonwealth are willing to increase Australia's position in the Pacific region, and it also proves the cooperation between the British countries. The Four-Power Commission is responsible for providing advice and consultation when MacArthur implements the instructions formulated by the eleven-nation Far Eastern Commission.</p>
<h3 id="e21">New Era in Sino-British Trade Relations <a href="#e21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 27th] Minister of Commerce Cripps said yesterday at a dinner of the Central Trade Association that Sino-British commercial relations have begun to enter a new stage. Before the war, our country's exports to China accounted for only 2% of our total exports, and China's imports from our country also accounted for a very small proportion. Since this war, most restrictions have been lifted. During the transition period, although we cannot make long-term loans, we can only exchange exports for imports. However, we believe that once shipping tonnage is restored, we can export to China as much as possible, and Chinese goods can also be shipped to Britain in a steady stream. Chinese Ambassador to Britain Gu Weijun also stated that China will purchase ships, train locomotives, steel, telephones, and electrical materials from Britain.</p>

<p>Nehru Addresses 250,000 People</p>
<p>[United Press, Bombay, 26th] Former Indian Congress Party leader Nehru came to Bombay today to inspect the damage. In the evening, he spoke to a sad crowd of 100,000 to 250,000 people on the beach, urging millions of Indians to pursue independence through peaceful means. If it is necessary to carry out a revolution, legitimate leaders will be able to send signals. Nehru severely attacked the "counter-revolutionaries" for leading the people of Bombay to carry out bloody riots, but said that if Britain does not leave India, India's diseases cannot be cured, and asked "every Indian in the army, navy, air force, and police force not to obey British orders to shoot or harm Indian compatriots. As for Commander Auchinleck's broadcast on Monday evening, announcing the official policy and deciding to punish the mutinying sailors who instigated the bloody riots, Nehru said that he could agree as long as the army, navy, and air force were free, "but we are asking for independence, not participating in politics. I cannot agree with Auchinleck's statement that Indian troops should obey the orders of their superiors and shoot unarmed Indian compatriots. Regarding the clash between Indian sailors and British troops at the Castle Barracks, Nehru said that they were just innocent children who had long been subjected to racial discrimination and inhuman treatment, so they could be forgiven." Nehru's speech was conversational and lasted approximately 90 minutes.</p>

<p>[Reuters, Nuremberg, 27th dispatch] The International War Crimes Tribunal today ruled against the defendant Ribbentrop's request to summon Churchill to testify. The tribunal also rejected Ribbentrop's request to write to Churchill to inquire about a certain event he had discussed with Churchill at the German Embassy in London when he was the German ambassador to Britain. Of the 38 witnesses Ribbentrop requested to summon, 22, including former French Prime Minister Daladier and former Foreign Minister Bonnet, were all rejected. Only seven former German foreign ministry officials, including Ribbentrop's private secretary Blank, were allowed by the tribunal to testify. Seven of the witnesses requested by Goering were approved, and he was also allowed to submit written questions to eight people, including Lord Halifax. Hess's witness was Bohle, the former head of the Nazi Party's overseas department.</p>
<p>[United Press, Nuremberg, 26th dispatch] Nazi terrorist atrocities have been accumulating overwhelming evidence in the International War Crimes Tribunal, but the pictures and films of killings screened today made all previous evidence seem insignificant. The Nazi defendants, who had always been indifferent to various testimonies of killings, suddenly changed color and showed sorrow upon seeing these pictures. The scenes depicted in the photos were like the acts of madmen. One photo showed German soldiers wielding axes to chop off the head of a Yugoslav, while fellow soldiers surrounded and laughed. Another photo showed stormtroopers swaying the already hanged corpses for amusement. Another photo showed vicious dogs and hungry pigs feasting on the corpses of those killed. Yet another photo showed the body of a Bosnian female teacher, Stanic, who was executed for joining Tito's Yugoslav army. Several stormtroopers were staring at her beside her. A scene first showed several Germans leading two sheepdogs, and then showed the two dogs biting a Yugoslav and tearing him to pieces, which was too horrible to watch. Later, a picture of the collective hanging of more than ten people was shown, with the executioners standing aside with arrogant smiles. Finally, two Tito soldiers were beheaded with an axe, and the stormtroopers watched and laughed. Then the head was placed on a table with a cigarette inserted in its mouth. Finally, the head was discarded on the ground, just like a child's toy that was discarded when tired of it.</p>

<h3 id="e39">Notes from the United Nations General Assembly: Two Equally Matched Figures: Bevin and Vyshinsky. Connally and Manuilsky are also an Old Pair. <a href="#e39" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c39" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">39</a></h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent Yu Feng from London</p>
<p>When the United Nations General Assembly first opened, many people shook their heads and sighed. They were not predicting the inevitable failure of the United Nations General Assembly, but lamenting the lack of outstanding figures at the meeting. In particular, journalists felt that there were very few figures with news value, and therefore missed the "Tiger Prime Minister" Clemenceau, Lloyd George, and Wilson of the post-World War I era.</p>
<p>After the Security Council held two meetings, everyone's perception began to change, believing that the General Assembly was making history and also creating figures. By the time the General Assembly ended, everyone was even more satisfied, because this meeting not only had colorful and outstanding figures, but was also a truly epoch-making record in the history of diplomacy. In this meeting, the so-called "diplomatic rhetoric" of the past was eliminated. All speeches and debates were straightforward and decisive, unlike the previous pretenses and circumlocutions.</p>
<p>Straightforward and Tit-for-Tat</p>
<p>British Foreign Secretary Bevin's style is completely different from Eden's. He does not pay attention to clothing and does not let any formal attire bind himself. He came from a dockworker background and has the style of a chivalrous hero. He speaks his mind frankly. He is equally matched with the Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Vyshinsky.</p>
<p>Vyshinsky does not give way in debates. He can speak English, but he always uses his native language in the venue. His words are translated, and perhaps they have lost the original essence, but even in the translation, you can hear his wit and intelligence.</p>
<p>Among the cases received by the Security Council, the first was Iran's accusation against the Soviet Union, and Britain supported Iran. The day after Iran filed the accusation, the Soviet Union raised the issue of British troops in Greece, and Ukraine raised the issue of British troops in Java "threatening world peace." Finally, Syria and Lebanon filed complaints about the presence of British and French troops in their countries "endangering peace." When this article was written, the Syrian-Lebanese incident was still under discussion and had not yet been resolved, but the other three cases had all been discussed and concluded. In these three cases, Britain and the Soviet Union were opposing protagonists, debating and attacking each other. Therefore, attending the Security Council meeting was like watching Bevin and Vyshinsky fight.</p>
<p>London's Fog is a Double Entendre</p>
<p>The prelude to the duel between the two began when discussing the date of the Military Staff Committee meeting. At that time, the United States' Stettinius proposed to hold the meeting on February 1, but Vyshinsky said it was not so certain, and the Soviet military representative might not be able to arrive on the 1st, "because," he said with a double entendre, "the weather between London and Moscow is bad!" Bevin did not give way and said with a smile, "I hope the Soviet representative can eliminate these fogs before February 1." Vyshinsky immediately poked the translator and told him to translate: "But the fog in London is always much thicker than elsewhere!"</p>
<p>Since then, the two have often exchanged humorous and tit-for-tat dialogues. The two of them are close neighbors at the horseshoe-shaped table of the Security Council. Sometimes they argue fiercely and then shake hands and make peace. One London newspaper drew a cartoon of Bevin and Vyshinsky fighting in the Middle Ages, shirtless and wielding swords.</p>
<p>Mouth Close to Ear, Not a Single Word Missed</p>
<p>Vyshinsky's personal interpreter sits behind him, with his mouth close to his ear. Bevin says a sentence, and he translates it in his ear, so Vyshinsky knows everything Bevin says without missing a single word and can answer on the spot.</p>
<p>When discussing the Greek and Javanese incidents, Vyshinsky cited various criticisms from the opposition during the British House of Commons debates on the Greek and Javanese incidents. Some of those parliamentarians also said that Britain was interfering in other people's internal affairs. He also cited communications from British newspapers, and the foreign correspondents also criticized the British government, believing that the British army was not supporting the revolutionary government. Bevin smoked while speaking and then answered with a cigarette slanting in his mouth: "We in the British Parliament can speak freely, and there are positive and negative opinions on one thing. I am really surprised that Mr. Vyshinsky is so familiar with one side of the opinion but so unfamiliar with the other side. Tomorrow I can send you a copy of the parliamentary record and ask you to study the other side of the opinion."</p>
<p>Jokes about the Press</p>
<p>"As for newspapers, they are just for entertainment (To Amuse to Entertain.) Sometimes they inevitably mislead readers (To Mislead.) I read the newspaper every day, so I don't take what the newspaper says so seriously." This caused the reporters present to laugh.</p>
<p>When the Security Council met the next day, Vyshinsky said: "Mr. Bevin actually thinks that newspapers are just for entertainment, which is really disrespectful to the press. The transmission of news depends entirely on newspapers. We don't have troops abroad, so what do we rely on for intelligence if we don't rely on newspapers?" Then, he cited a passage from the British Daily Herald and said with a smile, "Mr. Bevin should have some respect for this newspaper!" The whole audience burst into laughter because the Daily Herald is the organ of the Labour Party.</p>
<p>Bevin did not answer this directly but took a puff of smoke and said with a smile: "I'm too lazy to joke with the newspapers anymore."</p>
<p>Dueling, Pounding the Table</p>
<p>When the two argued tensely, they also pounded their fists on the table, and the whole venue was silent. Vyshinsky also likes to use gestures when speaking, holding a pencil, and I often worry that he will point it at Bevin's face next door. When Bevin mentioned Vyshinsky in his speech, he always stared at Vyshinsky, and sometimes he had a cigarette in his mouth when speaking.</p>
<p>Bevin's cheek muscles often twitch, and they twitch even more intensely when he is nervous. When Vyshinsky speaks passionately, he doesn't have a trace of a smile. For a moment, it will be cloudy, and it seems that a big storm is coming. But even in this dark situation, they never forget to bring a point or two of starlight. Sometimes in a tense situation, Bevin would suddenly say: "My friend Vyshinsky is a lawyer and is of course very familiar with the articles." Or just as they were preparing to fight, Vyshinsky would smile and call Bevin a Hot Headed Man.</p>
<p>Bevin's Wife Attends</p>
<p>Because of their wonderful performances in the Security Council, everyone wanted to attend the Security Council, and the small room was so crowded that it was impossible to ventilate. Smoking is not prohibited during the Council meetings, and it is smoky, hot, and stuffy. At one meeting, because they had to shoot a movie, the lights were bright, and the fat Bevin was sweating profusely.</p>
<p>Bevin and Vyshinsky argued the fiercest when discussing the Greek issue, but after the meeting, Bevin went to attend Vyshinsky's cocktail party, and the two talked more congenially than anyone else and laughed more happily than anyone else.</p>
<p>When Bevin was engaged in a war of words, his wife also attended, and many representatives' wives wanted to attend, as if they had been infected by their husbands and were particularly interested in politics.</p>
<p>Vyshinsky's wife did not come, but his daughter came with him. At his reception, his daughter was the hostess. Vyshinsky is originally from Poland, alert and eloquent, and is now Molotov's number one confidant.</p>
<p>Bevin's prestige increased greatly during the Security Council meetings because of his courageous and straightforward speech. In the United States, everyone was discussing Bevin. Going to listen to the Council seemed to be just to listen to Bevin and Vyshinsky arguing.</p>
<p>Another Partner Roars in the Middle of the Night</p>
<p>In the General Assembly, there are more than just Bevin and Vyshinsky who are good at partnering. There is another old pair—Manuilsky of Ukraine and Senator Connally of the United States. Both are old with silver hair, but their tempers are extremely high. Connally's voice is loud, and when he is angry, he is even more hoarse. When the subcommittee discussed the issue of the International Trade Union Federation wanting to participate in the United Nations General Assembly, Connally said: "Now we have to discuss this matter. Why did we reject the participation of our American trade union without saying a word? It's really shaving our beards!" The chairman was Spaak, the eloquent Belgian foreign minister. Spaak said: "I really don't understand why you want to insert this sentence!" Connally roared: "Do you think I don't know? Humph! There is a group of people manipulating this little association!" At that time, it was 1 a.m., and everyone thought of this matter and thought it was a midnight roar.</p>
<p>Roaring Off the Stage and Shaking Hands</p>
<p>At the end of the General Assembly, this matter was discussed again. First, Manuilsky spoke in fluent French, believing that the International Trade Union Federation should participate in the General Assembly. As soon as the speech ended, Connally immediately took the stage, shouting loudly, "Mr. Manuilsky" to the left and "Dr. Manuilsky" to the right, which made Manuilsky laugh. Old Mr. Connally spoke more and more vigorously, pounding the table and clapping his hands, almost breaking the table. After roaring off the stage, he shook hands with Manuilsky, which made the whole audience laugh. His wife was also present. It can be said that it was the most wonderful finale of the United Nations General Assembly and the last battle in this peace conference. (Sent from London on February 15)</p>

<h3 id="e41">Reader's Opinion: After Reading "How to Raise Funds for Industrial Construction" <a href="#e41" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c41" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">41</a></h3>
<p>— Zhang Yushan</p>
<p>Since the end of the war, countries have been working hard on reconstruction. China, as an industrially backward country, feels particularly concerned about this reconstruction. We deeply hope that China can quickly embark on the path of industrialization in terms of economic construction. Industrial construction in a country must have all the necessary basic conditions, but fundraising is of paramount importance. Recently, Mr. Zhao Tongyun's article "How to Raise Funds for Industrial Construction" (see this newspaper on the 17th of this month) suggested the establishment of a China Reconstruction Industrial Finance Corporation, because the machinery, materials, and manpower required for China's industrial construction are huge, and the long-term funds required are not something that ordinary banking organizations can provide. At the same time, China's exchange rate is not easy to determine for a while, and it is not easy for manufacturers to purchase the foreign exchange needed to order equipment from abroad. Therefore, it is planned to establish a China Reconstruction Industrial Finance Corporation, with state-owned banks and major commercial banks, trust companies, insurance companies, etc., jointly investing US$500 million and 5 billion national currency, as the central financial institution to support industrial reconstruction. This proposed company is not a creative suggestion, because industrial advanced countries such as Britain and the United States have this type of organization. All industrial construction in China is still in its infancy, so there is a more urgent need for a central financial institution to support industrial reconstruction. It can realize at least the following benefits:</p>
<p>(1) Solve the funds needed for industrial construction: China is short of funds, and the fundraising of long-term funds and medium-term funds required for industrial construction is the most difficult. If there is a central financial institution to coordinate the supply and make reasonable and effective use, then this difficulty can be solved.</p>
<p>(2) Absorb foreign investment for beneficial production: The amount of foreign investment in China is very large, but most of it is used for non-productive purposes, so it not only does not benefit China's economic development, but makes China in a more unfavorable position in terms of politics and economy. The establishment of the China Reconstruction Industrial Finance Corporation can, on the one hand, guide foreign investment absolutely for investment in productive construction projects; at the same time, it can use the power of the government to strengthen the company's credit abroad, and the amount and scope of utilizing foreign investment will be broader.</p>
<p>(3) Qualitative change in imported goods: Since the Reconstruction Industrial Finance Corporation acts as an agent for manufacturers to order materials needed for industrial construction from foreign countries, the machinery and raw materials imported by our country will greatly increase. This qualitative change in imported goods will mark a new era in the history of our country's international trade, and there is no doubt that it will be beneficial to the prosperity of the national economy.</p>
<p>(4) Strengthen the power to stabilize foreign exchange: The amount of gold, foreign currency bonds, and foreign exchange held by the people in our country is huge. In terms of individuals, this holding of wealth only has the effect of maintaining purchasing power; in terms of the entire country, this huge amount of gold has not had a favorable effect on national production. Now that there is a central financial institution for industrial reconstruction, the gold, foreign currency bonds, and foreign exchange held by the people can all be used reasonably and effectively.</p>
<p>We confirm that the suggestion to establish the China Reconstruction Industrial Finance Corporation has an inevitable value in the process of completing the great economic construction of industrialization. However, China has a vast territory, and the types and scope of various industrial constructions are very broad. Whether the use of US$500 million and 5 billion national currency can complete this great cause for all ages, the amount of capital really needs to be reconsidered.</p>
<p>After eight years of war, the people's livelihood has withered. Since the victory, all production undertakings have returned to a standstill. We deeply feel that the disposal of enemy and puppet property must not be aimed solely at fiscal revenue, but should be based on maintaining and increasing production. "Killing the chicken to get the eggs" is not something that wise people should do. We deeply hope that the financial authorities will take a long-term view, start from the near future, seize the opportunity, and first concentrate all their efforts to break the chains of the vicious circle. Perhaps the establishment of the China Reconstruction Industrial Finance Corporation can promote industrial construction and achieve the practical effect of increasing production.</p>
<h3 id="e42">Commentary: Measures That Should Be Taken to Suppress Special Prices <a href="#e42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>— Xu Erxin</p>
<p>Since the victory of peace, prices in various places have continued to rise, especially after the market opened near the recent Lunar New Year, the momentum has become even more intense, like a raging fire. Those who hold gold, foreign currencies, stocks, and various goods have all obtained huge profits. Those with idle funds are rushing to withdraw cash from banks to buy gold, banknotes, and materials, vying with each other, and the black market interest rate has soared to more than two, people are panicked, and society is showing extreme anxiety. Common people are groaning and haggard, and their lives are extremely painful. Chairman Chiang heard the news in Hangzhou and specially came to Shanghai to summon important figures in the financial and industrial sectors to instruct on countermeasures to suppress prices, which shows that although the Chairman is busy with myriad affairs every day, he is always concerned about the people's suffering. At this time of high prices, insightful people in Shanghai have suggested that the government's existing gold reserves should be sold off as much as possible by suspending listings with official prices to suppress gold prices and stabilize commodity prices. Others have advocated that gold should be nationalized so that gold cannot be used for evil and lose its role in leading commodity prices. In fact, rising prices have both natural and man-made causes, involving politics, finance, currency, finance, production, consumption, transportation, and hoarding and manipulation. A rise in gold prices may indeed stimulate a rise in commodity prices, but it cannot be said that gold prices necessarily lead general commodity prices. At present, the market is flooded with idle funds with no suitable destination, and the amount of goods is huge. Selling off the government's existing gold is like a drop in the bucket and is difficult to sustain. If the gold runs out and the strategy fails, the price of gold will skyrocket, and the phenomenon that occurred when Chongqing stopped listing prices will not be difficult to repeat. Although there are no precise statistics on the gold owned by the people in various places, the estimated amount must be very large. If the government nationalizes it, even if part of the price is matched with the official price and part is given in cash, the issuance of this huge amount of banknotes will inevitably increase the rate of price increases, and the US dollar can also replace gold and play a role in leading commodity prices. The theory of nationalizing gold is not feasible at present and can only be regarded as a way to stabilize finance, and it should not be used as a good countermeasure to solve the extremely complex price problem at present. The author believes that the current price increases are due to three main reasons: the expansion of the amount of currency in circulation, the lack of materials, and the lack of confidence in legal tender among the people.</p>
<p>Therefore, to suppress prices, the government and all the people must work together on the three aspects that cause price increases to implement both short-term and long-term measures. Otherwise, only partial handling, treating the head when it hurts and the foot when it hurts, or the government blaming the common people, or the people criticizing the government, the result will be "propping up the east while the west collapses" or even no effect at all. The author has held this view very early, and now I will reiterate these implementation countermeasures separately below:</p>
<p>(A) Regarding the "currency" aspect: (1) Contracting the currency in circulation. At present, the Central Bank cannot adopt the policy of raising discount rates and open market operations to contract the currency in circulation, but since the Central Bank is in the position of "the bank of banks" and the issuance of banknotes has already shown a tendency to concentrate, it must be cautious about lending to other banks in the future, and there should also be considerable restrictions on advances and loans to the government to ensure that more is received and less is given out. The allocation of funds to the silver and money industry should also be strictly supervised, and all loan extensions such as credit mortgages of various banks and villages should be investigated at any time to prevent them from being used for speculation. (2) Consolidate various tax revenues to make them abundant, especially direct taxes, which must be seriously consolidated to transfer the purchasing power of the people. Absolutely prohibit the tax package system, strictly eliminate corruption, and ensure that every drop goes to the public. (3) Cut redundant agencies and adjust institutions at all levels to make them reasonable. Reduce redundant personnel and focus on administrative efficiency. Temporarily adopt a policy of "recuperating with the people," stop all non-urgent matters, and strive to achieve a balance of payments. (4) Issue new public bonds or temporary treasury bills and force wealthy households to underwrite them. (5) Conduct wealth registration. All tangible and intangible wealth must be registered uniformly, and the household name should be limited to the name on the national identity card issued in accordance with the Household Registration Law and should not have a pseudonym. This wealth registration can be of great help in consolidating direct taxes and can be used as the basis for apportioning public bonds, which is in line with the principle of ability to pay taxes. (6) Take over enemy and puppet factories in various places and sell stocks based on their assets. Quickly establish a legitimate securities trading market to guide idle funds to industrial and commercial enterprises and bring them into line. (7) Promote savings or force national savings, or hold prize-winning savings. (8) Increase the interest rate on savings deposits, restrict credit demand deposits, and investigate their whereabouts at any time to prevent idle funds from doing evil. (9) Reduce the size of the army and adopt the principle of elite troops. All officers and soldiers who are laid off should engage in reclamation and industry and agriculture to increase production. (10) For enterprises that have a monopoly and cannot be run by private individuals, they should be either state-owned or jointly run by officials and merchants, so that the income can be used to subsidize the shortage of the national treasury or absorb part of the idle funds of private individuals.</p>
<p>(B) Regarding the "material" aspect: (1) Restore water and land transportation, and the mountain Japanese captives will implement road construction and river dredging projects to increase the number of cargo ships and vehicles to facilitate the transportation of goods. (2) Public and private factories must all start work within a limited time. The original enemy and puppet factories must continue to be responsible by Japanese technicians who are about to reach the date. (3) Encourage private investment in various enterprises and guarantee principal and interest. (4) Labor and management should adopt the principle of coordination, and political strikes and work slowdowns are strictly prohibited. (5) Borrow money from foreign countries and provide a sufficient amount of foreign exchange to various gold industries to purchase the necessary raw materials and machinery to expand production. (6) Sell the materials in the warehouses sealed by the enemy and puppets at a flat price and prevent good merchants from monopolizing profits. (7) Fully transport coal to supply cheap electricity. (8) Strictly prohibit similar taxes in various places and implement the crackdown on all exorbitant taxes.</p>
<p>(C) Regarding the "people" aspect: (1) Stabilize people's hearts, arouse the people's confidence in legal tender, and break their concept of valuing things over currency. All the people of the country must work together with the spirit of "fathers teaching their sons and brothers encouraging their younger brothers" so that the credit of legal tender will be enhanced and the value will be increased. (The issuance of banknotes can make commodity prices rise, but the accelerated circulation of currency will easily promote commodity price increases. At present, people are throwing out legal tender to buy goods, and the circulation of legal tender is very fast. Even if the currency is contracted and the output of materials is increased, if it is implemented effectively, the general public will still have the concept of despising legal tender, and the value of goods will still have to rise. Therefore, enhancing confidence in legal tender is a necessary condition for increasing the value of legal tender.) (2) Crack down on speculation, such as strictly prohibiting illegal black market transactions, inspecting warehouse materials, registering, investigating the whereabouts of bills, investigating the source of relevant financial rumors, and punishing speculative and manipulative merchants, but these passive measures can only have a temporary effect. (3) Domestic peace and unity, and improve politics, so that the people have support and respect for the government, and thus welcome and love legal tender and believe in legal tender. (4) Before the government authorities can clearly declare the financial policy (such as the determination of the exchange rate), they should be cautious in their remarks, and it is even more inappropriate to have inconsistent remarks before and after, or to deny them after the fact, so that speculators can speculate on their intentions and take the opportunity to create rumors, take advantage of opportunities, and speculate for profit. (5) Promote thrift and practice hard work and endurance to avoid waste of materials.</p>
<p>The above-mentioned implementation countermeasures are not very high-level, but if the government and the people of the whole country rise up and implement them separately, the problem of rising prices will not be difficult to solve. If commodity prices can gradually fall, the value of the currency will be stabilized, and people's livelihood will be stabilized. It is unnecessary for ordinary people to worry about issuing so-called "Sun Yat-sen banknotes." I hope that the people of the country will unanimously support the National Government, cherish and believe in the legal tender issued by the National Government, so that its value will be permanently stable, commodity prices will not fluctuate, and we can share a life of happiness and well-being. Those who do not hesitate to destroy the value of legal tender, shake the belief in legal tender, and hope to obtain huge profits due to rising prices should be regarded as public enemies of the nation.</p>

<h3 id="e43">Industry and Commerce Sectors Send Telegram to the Second Plenary Session — Opposing Specialization in Northeast China; Emergency Measures Should Be Taken to Deal with the Economic Crisis; Efforts Should Be Made to Save the Price Rampage; Presenting Three Points of Opinion <a href="#e43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce held a welcome reception for Wu Kaixian, Director of the Bureau of Social Affairs, at the Dadong Restaurant, and discussed important current economic and diplomatic issues. Representatives from various industry associations, including Luo Qinghua, Jin Lanku, Li Shuxiong, and Xu Xiaochu, and more than 300 others attended. Luo Qinghua, Chairman, delivered a speech first. After Director Wu Kaixian reported on the latest industrial and commercial administrative facilities, it was unanimously passed that the association and the 89 industry associations present would jointly send a telegram to the Second Plenary Session (1) firmly opposing specialization in Northeast China, requesting that decisive and effective emergency measures be taken, (2) suppressing prices and preventing the economic crisis. The original text of the telegram reads: To the Honorable Members of the Second Plenary Session of the Central Committee in Chongqing: In recent days, the price rampage has fluctuated across the country, and people are panicked, reaching an extreme point. Strikes and work slowdowns are happening everywhere, and they are mutually causal with price fluctuations. The economic crisis affects social order. The associations and others are shocked by this situation and feel a sense of crisis. Now, we respectfully offer three points of humble opinion, sincerely requesting that the honorable meeting take decisive and effective emergency measures. 1. All enemy and puppet materials have been taken over for half a year. In Shanghai alone, there are more than 2,000 sealed warehouses. To date, there are no measures to deal with them. The reason for this is that those at the top deliberately wait for the price to be high to make an unreasonable contribution to the national treasury, while those at the bottom try to delay the matter in order to manipulate things and maintain their own positions. As a result, materials become moldy and rot, are stolen, and various malpractices occur. All these phenomena fully expose the incompetence of the receiving personnel and the dereliction of duty of the management personnel. It should be strictly ordered that all of them be investigated and dealt with before the end of March, either returned to the original owners or sold publicly at a flat price to suppress commodity prices. 2. The enemy and puppet factories that have been taken over should be strictly ordered to immediately investigate the actual situation. If any of them were indeed forcibly occupied by the enemy and puppets, they should be returned to the original owners to take over. If they are indeed enemy and puppet properties, they should be given priority for lease or sale to the industrial circles in the front and rear who have suffered losses due to the War of Resistance. A deadline should be set for them to start work and increase production. The Enemy and Puppet Property Management Bureau should be ordered to complete the conclusion before the end of March. 3. Oppose disguised state-owned companies competing with the people for profits, monopolizing and manipulating, tracking down the black market, stimulating prices, and causing the main factors of today's price surge and social unrest. They should be strictly corrected to calm the people. And with a quick knife to cut through the messy hemp, the enemy and puppet yarn and cloth they have taken over should be sold in large quantities and publicly at a flat price as stated in the first point. The factories they have taken over should be returned to the original owners within a time limit as stated in the second point, or leased and sold to the industrial circles to start work. As for this type of disguised state-owned company itself, it should be closed immediately to save public funds. The above points are earnestly requested to be quickly adopted and implemented urgently. The future of the country is deeply relied upon. Shanghai Chamber of Commerce and Shanghai Silk and Satin Industry, Paper Industry, Woolen Industry, Xinle Industry, Cotton Cloth Industry, and other 89 industry associations, all kowtow, feeling.</p>

<p>Xu Shichang's Body Was Examined Yesterday</p>
<p>[This newspaper news] Lawyer Xu Shichang, a native of Zhejiang, willingly collaborated with the enemy during the Anti-Japanese War and participated in puppet organizations, serving successively as the president of the Chongming District Court, the chief prosecutor of the Taicang District Court Prosecutor's Office, and the prosecutor of the Wuxing District Court Prosecutor's Office and other puppet positions. After the victory, he fled to Shanghai and hid at No. 242 Aimee Yu Xian Road. Because someone reported him to the Wuxing judicial authorities, Chen Wenxin, the prosecutor of the Wuxing County District Court, who also served as a prosecutor of the High Court, prepared a document and sent Xu Chushu and Qian Jiang of the police bureau to Shanghai to request the Shanghai District Court Prosecutor's Office to send personnel to assist in arresting Xu at his residence on Aimee Yu Xian Road on the afternoon of the 26th. He was imprisoned on the fourth floor of the Shanghai District Court Prosecutor's Office detention center on Masnan Road and listed as prisoner No. 982. It is now known that the prisoner had a habit. When the institute sent personnel to inspect the prison cell as usual the other day, they found a bag of opium paste in Xu's pocket. Xu was panicked and took the opportunity to jump from the fourth floor, causing his skull to break and blood to flow all over the ground. Although the institute gave him emergency treatment, he died at five o'clock. Yesterday, the District Court Prosecutor's Office sent a prosecutor to examine the body, and his son collected it for burial.</p>

<p>Gu Guoxiong Tried Again Yesterday</p>
<p>[This newspaper news] Gu Guoxiong, a secret agent of the enemy's Shanghai South Gendarmerie in Penglai Road, had previously colluded with the enemy gendarmerie to arrest Yang Jiaji, director of the Pudong branch of the Three People's Principles Youth League, but failed, and then took his sister Yang Waner back to the enemy gendarmerie on Bei Dang Road, where she was severely tortured and detained for seven days before being released. After the victory, Yang Waner suddenly ran into him while shopping at the Daxin Company, so she reported him to the police and arrested him. The High Court Prosecutor's Office concluded the investigation and filed a public prosecution. The case has been tried once, and the defendant firmly denied that he had been a secret agent, only claiming to be a handyman. Yesterday morning, Judge Cao Jun opened the court again to question him and summoned Yang Jiaji and Yang Waner to court to falsely describe what happened. The defendant still tried to quibble and deny. The court ordered that the case be investigated further and adjourned for another hearing.</p>
<h3 id="e48">Four Japanese War Criminals Tried for the First Time <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>They Killed Three American Airmen</p>
<p>[This newspaper news] Another war criminal trial committee organized by Lieutenant Colonel Macklennan (presiding judge), Colonel Cabot, and six others yesterday morning for the first time tried the Japanese war criminals who killed three members of the Doolittle Raiders at Tilanqiao Prison: Lieutenant General Sawada Shigeru, former commander of the 13th Division; Captain Tachita Sotciro, former commander of the Jiangwan prisoner-of-war camp; Captain Wakou Yujisei, a member of the Japanese military court; and Lieutenant Okada Ryuhei. Plaintiff Lieutenant Colonel Han Derlun stood up and read Sawada Shigeru's seven charges, accusing him of establishing a military court between August and October 1942, violating the rules for prisoners of war, and sentencing Lieutenant Homerak, Lieutenant Faro, Sergeant Spatz, and Lieutenant Meter (this person did not die) to death in Shanghai, and sentencing Lieutenant Haet, Lieutenant Barr, Lieutenant Nelson, and Sergeant Thiercher to life imprisonment, and adding torture. He then accused Tachita of executing Homerak, Faro, and Spatz on October 15, 1942, and torturing the other four American airmen. He also accused Wakou and Okada of the same crime, sentencing the three American airmen to death without following formal trial procedures. Defense attorney Lieutenant Colonel Boting raised objections to the number of jurors in court, and then requested that the court be cancelled. The court ordered that the points raised by the defendant's defense attorney be strictly rejected. Defense attorney Captain Feros then requested that the charges against the four defendants be dropped, but the court rejected them one by one. After both sides debated until 12:30, the court immediately summoned each prisoner to stand before the court and asked whether they had committed any crimes. All four prisoners replied "Not guilty." At this point, the court announced that the trial would begin at 9:00 a.m. on March 11.</p>
<p>In addition, the case of the eighteen Japanese war criminals killing Chinese and American airmen is scheduled to be pronounced at 9:00 a.m. this morning.</p>

It is also learned that regarding the transportation of relief materials, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, the Shipping Association, the Logistics Department Waterway Military Transportation Command, and other agencies have agreed to use various ships for military transportation, public transportation, and civilian transportation.

<p>The Tentative Price Is 8,000 Yuan per Market Dan</p>
<p>After the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration of the Executive Yuan began to sell flour without restriction on the 21st at 6,000 yuan per bag, the black market price of flour and rice gradually fell. The administration has also announced that it will sell American wheat from the 28th. All flour mills in this port and other ports with complete equipment that can start grinding flour after purchasing American wheat may formally apply to the administration with a letter based on the following terms and conditions, and it will be reviewed and allocated: (1) Price: The American wheat sold by the administration is calculated in market dan, and the tentative price is 8,000 yuan per market dan. (2) Payment: After the factory receives the administration's notification of the approved quantity, it must pay the full amount of the goods in cash and then pick up the goods, but those who purchase a whole ship of American wheat may apply for installment payment. (3) Delivery: After the transport ship carrying American wheat arrives in Shanghai, the administration will notify the factory to deliver the goods in the ship's hold. All expenses such as weighing, lighterage, and overdue ship rent shall be borne by the factory. (However, those who purchase a small amount of American wheat may apply to pick up the goods in the administration's warehouse, and in addition to the wheat, they must pay the aforementioned expenses.) (4) Hemp bags: The factory must provide its own.</p>
<p>(Another report) It is said that Wu Kaixian, Director of the Bureau of Social Affairs, has asked the two relief administrations to reduce the price of flat-price flour by another 1,000 yuan to further lower the market price, and suggested that the purchase quantity per household should be reduced to two bags. Those who purchase more than two bags for firms and factories must have a certificate from the respective agencies to show restrictions and prevent malpractices.</p>

<p>Ms. Tingde Hosted the Press Yesterday</p>
<p>[This newspaper news] The British Information Office in this city yesterday, because Ms. Hende, a British labor expert who had served in the Shanghai Municipal Council for more than ten years, revisited Shanghai after touring Chongqing, Myanmar, Hong Kong, and other places to investigate labor and social welfare conditions, specially invited Chinese and foreign reporters to the British Consulate on the Bund. Mr. Luo, the director of the office, and La Jiasuliya, the editor-in-chief, and others hosted the event.</p>
<p>Insufficient Distribution and Supply of Materials</p>
<p>After Mr. Luo introduced Ms. Hende to the reporters, Ms. Hende delivered a speech, roughly saying that the United Kingdom sincerely supports the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, and the United Kingdom's donation of 110 million US dollars out of the 675 million yuan allocated by the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration to China accounts for about one-sixth of the total amount. The predecessor of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration was actually the "Allied Post-War Needs Committee" established in London in October 1941, and the chairman of the committee was Sir Li Ziluosi, who is very familiar to the Chinese. However, the United Kingdom does not want to donate to the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration with one hand and then ask the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration for assistance with the other to supply Malaysia, Myanmar, and other places. Therefore, the United Kingdom has to find other ways for relief and bear the responsibility of double donations. At present, the distribution of materials in these countries is strictly controlled, but insufficient supply has become the main difficulty.</p>
<p>Widespread High Prices</p>
<p>Ms. Hende then answered questions from reporters, roughly saying (1) Wage standards cannot keep up with commodity prices, which has become a common situation in various countries. Regarding the labor-management disputes in this port, because the situation is not very clear, it remains to be studied. (2) About 100 to 300 tons of relief supplies are transported to Guangdong by railway every day, but now another 500 trucks have been prepared to assist in transportation. (3) There have been strikes in Singapore, and there are many labor-management disputes in Hong Kong, especially the dock workers' strike that lasted for two months, but there was no strike. Ms. Hende is quite concerned about the situation of the Shanghai press and promised to pay attention to the shortage of paper. She said that the largest British newspaper, The Times of London, currently only publishes two large sheets.</p>

<p>At around 8:00 a.m. on the 27th, at Zhu Hongwen's home at No. 12 Fukang Road, Yangjiadu, Pudong, a mob of 30 to 40 people, each holding axes, pistols, iron bars, etc., suddenly stormed in. Because they could not find Zhu Hongwen, they grabbed Pan Xiaoniuzi and Xiao Heizi (namely Zhang Gunchun), and used axes to strike Pan's head three times in the back of the house, immediately causing him to fall to the ground and die. Xiao Heizi and Zhu Zhangshi were also injured in the head. The mob fired several shots into the sky and dispersed. The Yangjiadu Police Station rushed to the scene and arrested more than ten suspects, including Chen Guisan and Yang Jinlin, and took them to the bureau for interrogation. It was found that the main culprits in this case were Chen Xiaogou, Wu Changfa, and Liu Fugen, and personnel were dispatched to continue to arrest them. It is said that this case was caused by a dispute over the reinstatement of dock porters. There had been two conflicts on the 9th and 10th of this month, and mediation had failed to reach a settlement, which led to another incident.</p>

<p>The Xumo motor-powered junk, leased by the Ningding Shipping Company, departed from Shanghai on the 17th, carrying 87 tons of cargo to Hankou. On the following day, when sailing near Zhang Huanggang, upstream of Nantong, it encountered a sudden surge of rapid tidal currents coupled with strong winds. The small vessel was unable to withstand the force and ran aground on the sandbank. After the tide receded, it could not be pulled out for some time, resulting in prolonged grounding and damage to the ship's bottom. Consequently, the upstream journey was halted. It was towed to Shanghai the day before yesterday and is currently docked at Buoy No. 4, awaiting repairs.</p>

<p>Also, it is heard that the Fuel Management Committee encourages coal imports from abroad, and many coal companies have ordered foreign coal, which will arrive in large quantities soon. At the same time, it will also support the mining and transportation of small mines' local coal and white coal near Beijing and Hangzhou, which will also be a small supplement in supply. As for the coal stored along the Jinpu Railway Line, it can only be used for the railway and military and public use along the line for the time being and cannot be supplied to Shanghai. The shortage will be transported from Shanghai. It is expected that the Huainan Coal Mine Tongzha Wharf Railway will be repaired next month, and a large amount will be transported to Shanghai.</p>

<p>— Nianzu</p>
<p>Silver, cash, in-kind donations, and monthly donations are all welcome.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Poor Children's Vocational Institute in Xiaonanmen, Nanshi, has been established for eight years. At that time, it was during the 813 Incident, and the national army withdrew westward, and refugees were all over the field. Therefore, gentry such as Qia Qiqing organized the Refugee Relief Association to accommodate Shanghai disaster victims. Because there were many difficult children, it was urgent to provide education and training, so the Poor Children's Vocational Institute was established. Over the past eight years, all the directors have supported it arduously and never raised donations from outside. The newly appointed honorary chairman, Huang Jinrong, and chairman, Wang Xiaolai, etc., seeing that the equipment in the hospital still needs to be expanded, and the number of difficult children is increasing day by day, and the monthly expenses are also increasing. In addition to the monthly donations recognized by the directors, it is a huge deficit. They appealed to enthusiastic people in the society to donate money, monthly donations, or in-kind donations, such as daily necessities, clothing materials, medical and health supplies, etc., all are welcome, please send to the hospital office at No. 148 Longmen Road, Baxianqiao. When the newspaper publishes the thank-you. Currently, there are nearly a hundred poor boys and girls in the hospital. They attend classes in the morning and work in the afternoon, divided into sewing, paper boxes, net bags, etc., and there is also a well-trained military band. The teaching and management in the hospital are serious, and Chinese and foreign people who visit the hospital appreciate it.</p>
<h3 id="e65">Remaining Counterfeit Currency Transferred to Educational Loan Fund <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>Reader's Letter Suggestion</p>
<p>Shen Bao reporter and gentlemen and ladies from all walks of life: We have a small suggestion that you will definitely be happy to support. This question is very simple and very important. I think you must have a lot of counterfeit currency in your hands, ten, hundred, thousand, ten thousand, etc., no matter how much, only one month, the exchange period is about to arrive. Instead of putting it in the drawer, why not send it to the vault, collect it into a number, and then send it to Shen Bao for the educational loan fund to help a few more poor students. Why not do it? A personal view seems reasonable. If you adopt it, please publish it. As for collection and safekeeping, I would like to trouble your newspaper to do its best to support it, which is even more appropriate. Sincerely yours, Wu Xinming, Da Ranzhi Company, to Shen Bao Social Service Column.</p>
<p>Editor's Note: Mr. Wu's suggestion is excellent. Please implement it first. This column will be happy to collect it on your behalf. It is hoped that readers will donate enthusiastically, and poor students will benefit infinitely. This is indeed the only contribution to saving materials for the country.</p>

<h3 id="e66">Gold, Banknotes, and Bonds Fall After Exchange Market Opens; Exchange Rate Still Subject to Speculation <a href="#e66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>Han Chi: Yesterday, the foreign exchange market was opened, and Mr. Pei took office as the governor of the Central Bank, the speculation wind gradually subsided. The general psychology is still looking at 2,000 to 1 for the US dollar and 1.35 million for gold, so yesterday the US dollar was inferior to gold in the market. It opened at 1.43 million in the morning, and the lowest was 1.37 million. There was surplus funds to absorb the bottom, (real goods receive real goods, not counting interest, there is absolutely no speculative effect,) once rebounded to 1.51 million, (the buying and selling price is far apart, it is extremely difficult to be sure,) but the US dollar failed to keep up, but saw degradation, it still fell to a little more than 1.4 million at noon, a decrease of 150,000 from the previous close. In the afternoon, the US dollar fell below 2,100 yuan, and the asking price fell below 1.4 million. There were few transactions and it was no longer widespread. The quotations of each firm are different, and the 1.4 million mark fluctuates. The gold ornaments are not listed, the patterned silver is 2,000 yuan, and the silver dollar is about 850 yuan. Supply exceeds demand, and the interest rate is still around 20%.</p>
<p>US Dollar: Yesterday, the majority of the people thought that 2,000 to 1, and the market price was still 10% higher. The seller still felt profitable. It opened at 2,270 yuan in the morning. The seller continued to work hard and gradually dropped to about 2,100 yuan, and then recovered slightly, but it was still difficult to last above 2,150 yuan. At noon, it was still hovering around 2,100 yuan, a decrease of about 300 yuan from the previous close. Although Hong Kong dollars should be an exception, (calculated at 2,000 to 1 for the US dollar, the Hong Kong dollar should be 500 yuan based on the British and American exchange rate, and it should be about 330 yuan based on the Hong Kong black market US dollar,) but in any case, the buyer is ultimately difficult to cheer up, and the new goods are even worse. As a result, the old goods fell by 10 yuan, and the new goods also fell by more than 10 yuan. The transaction was quiet.</p>
<p>Public Debt: At the beginning, the market was still tired, and the hot money hoped to show off. Someone absorbed it at a low price. Category C rebounded from 1,300 to 1,550 yuan, and finally about 1,500 yuan, which was slightly better than the previous close of 50 yuan. Other miscellaneous brands failed to keep up. The Chinese stocks are still hovering around the previous day's price. Some unpopular stocks are in demand, but the asking price is not high, and it is difficult to conclude a deal. Foreign stocks are also about half a percentage point. All of this is real goods supply and demand, and pure counterparty lacks openness.</p>
<h3 id="e67">Gold Price Falls, Yarn and Cloth also Dip Slightly <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>Cotton Yarn: Yesterday, the yarn market became more depressed. The price of gold continued to fall, and people's hearts were tired because of this. As a result of the competition among peers, it fell by more than 10% compared with the previous day. Except for Double Horse, the 20-count yarn has returned to the million-dollar mark. The 16-count Guangming saw 910,000 at the beginning, and the closing price fell to 860,000. In the downward trend of various yarn lines, this brand is relatively slow.</p>
<p>Cotton: Yesterday, the transaction of raw cotton was still smooth, and the market situation was still fresh. It was purely affected by the gold black market and the yarn and cloth fell. Generally, the holders depreciated and sold, resulting in a situation of smooth sales and tired prices. The Fangjian Company exclusively imported a huge amount of 2,000 pieces of American cotton, and the Shenxin Yarn Factory imported 5600 bales of fire cotton, and the factory price was reduced by another 34,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Cotton Cloth: The transaction was quiet. Looking at the opening of foreign exchange and the small gold price, all gangs are in a wait-and-see attitude. This street is also in a state of desolation due to the sale of cheap cloth.</p>

<p>A large batch of American cotton and gasoline arrived in Shanghai. The Jardine Matheson &amp; Co.'s Toyo Prince, loaded with more than 7,900 pieces of cotton, more than 19,000 barrels of gasoline, and 410 tons of diesel from Los Angeles, entered the port at about 3 pm yesterday and docked at the Asia Terminal first to unload gasoline, and there were 48 passengers who landed at the Customs Terminal on a small boat at the same time. After the gasoline is unloaded, it will be moved to the Sino-American Company Terminal to unload cotton.</p>
<p>A large amount of Changjiang bristles came to Shanghai. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Jiang Yu ship arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday and transported 1,115 pieces of black bristles and 23 pieces of white bristles from Yichang, which is the first large batch of bristles to arrive in Shanghai after the war.</p>

<p>Yesterday, all grains went downstream in unison. The rice market has been overwhelmed with arrivals and unable to digest. It dropped another 2,000 yuan. Flour also dropped slightly by 200 yuan. Soybeans were extremely sluggish and dropped sharply by more than 1,000 yuan. The price of oil plummeted. There are still sources in Qingdao, and the price is slightly lower by more than 2,000 yuan. Bean cake is tired and falls by 1200 yuan, and bran is nearly 100 yuan lower. Only raw peanuts can still stand.</p>
<p>The coal market transaction is still clean, and the market is gradually stabilizing. Yesterday, a batch of about 100 tons of Lizhang white coal was transported to Shanghai. The coal is produced in Daye, Hubei. The quality is slightly inferior to Yangquan coal, and it is also a good raw material for manufacturing briquettes. This time, it was transshipped from Wuhu to Shanghai, and the price was 220,000 yuan. The transaction was still strong.</p>

<h3 id="e70">Zhejiang Education Department Calls School Principals' Meeting; Soaring Rice Prices Severely Impact Teachers and Students; School Principals Bitterly Narrate Facts, Requesting Schools to be Maintained <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper's Hangzhou correspondent] Recently, the price of rice in Hangzhou has suddenly risen. On the 21st, middle-grade white rice was still 18,500 yuan, but on the 24th, it soared to 26,700 yuan and is still rising. Public and private secondary schools in Hangzhou are opening at this time, and tens of millions of primary and secondary school teachers and students are severely affected. There is a great possibility that students will not be able to enroll and schools will not be able to open. The education problem is extremely serious. The Education Department specially convened principals of public schools in the provincial capital, as well as section chiefs, supervisors, and secretaries, on the afternoon of the 23rd for a joint consultation. The principals bitterly narrated the facts, on the one hand, pleading for the teachers and students, and on the other hand, requesting the schools to be maintained. The meeting lasted for three hours, and the situation was very tense. According to a certain school principal, there are currently four difficulties: (1) The problem of reinstatement expenses. When schools open and students attend classes, food, lodging, and teaching equipment cannot be reduced. The amount of reinstatement expenses received by each school is very small, and it is really impossible to handle it. There was no result in today's consultation. The schools can only be simple, and teachers and students can only sleep on the floor and recite on the mat. Classrooms, dormitories, and dining halls are mixed together. Based on the current situation of each school, it is possible to borrow money from students. (2) The food problem of publicly funded students, normal school students, and vocational school students. The central government stipulates a monthly staple food fee of 4,000 yuan, and the province has temporarily allocated 3,000 yuan per person per month due to the expansion of the quota, which can only provide more than ten kilograms of rice, which is a big difference. In addition to reporting to the central government and requesting the Grain Office to allocate parity rice, the shortfall can only be collected from the students, which is a serious difficulty for some poor students. (3) The problem of excessive burden on students. This is a price problem, and no one can solve it. The provincial schools only collect 35 to 40 catties of rice for miscellaneous fees, and a total of 1,000 to 1,300 yuan for physical education, medical care, and derivative internships. The collection of miscellaneous fees is only 120,000 yuan for the provincial school's office expenses. The Education Department maintains the hardship of education. The collection of miscellaneous fees is to make up for its use and must be reported to the department for review. The remaining food rice, non-staple food, books, school supplies, and lecture fees are all agency-based in nature, and the profits are returned. A total of 200 catties of rice for the entire semester for boarding students, only 2,400 yuan per month for non-staple food expenses, and other expenses are 14,350 to 22,350 yuan. The most difficult thing is the rice problem. (4) The problem of teachers' lives. The salaries of teachers in this province are meager. At today's rice price, their income is only enough to buy rice. The hardship of life can be imagined. It is planned to ask the Grain Office to issue parity rice to alleviate it slightly.</p>

<p>[Reported by this city] Many private tutoring schools in this city use names such as "English College" or "Industrial College" without authorization and publish advertisements to solicit students. In fact, they are not at the level of professional materials, and they have started without the approval of the Ministry of Education. In view of this, the Municipal Education Bureau is actively investigating and banning them. For Cambridge English College, Zhijiang English College, Yiyi English College, Mengxian English College Day and Night School, and China Commercial English College Day and Night School, Nanyang Wireless Engineering College, China Journalism College and other nine schools, the ministry order has been notified. The Education Bureau ordered each school not to use the name "College" or "Mouxue College" and must correct the school name as soon as possible. Schools with a college degree should promptly submit it to the Municipal Education Bureau for transfer to the Ministry of Education to carry out the registration procedures, and they must wait until the opening of the college is approved before they can enroll students.</p>

<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Recently, professors of national universities in this city have complained that the prices are rising wildly and the treatment is meager, which is not even as good as a worker in the National Bank. They specially invited reporters to the Youth Association yesterday to tell their hardships. Li Ximou, Pan Chengliang, Chen Daxie, Zhu Baiying, Fudan Ying Chengyi, Chen Kemei, Lin Da Pan, Mai Weiyu, Zhong Zhaolin and other professors from Jiaotong University who attended the meeting first reported on the current situation of treatment by Zhu Baiying. They are still calculated according to the civil servants' base salary of 80 times and the living allowance of 28,000 yuan. The professor who should have the deepest salary can only get 76,000 yuan for a monthly salary of 600 yuan. Other associate professors, lecturers, teaching assistants, etc. are even more miserable. It is said that a professor does not go out of the gate, but his monthly salary is used up to the eighteenth day, so if the government does not personally see the complete bankruptcy of education, there should be a good way to increase the treatment of professors so that they can teach and research with peace of mind. They dare not expect to fully follow the cost of living index, but hope to make reasonable adjustments with reference to the cost of living index, and issue research fees and food rice. If the country always ignores or has no sincerity to solve their lives, then they will only have to resign collectively, change to other industries, and each professor said that they will establish the National University Professors Federation within days and send a telegram to the Second Plenary Session of the Central Committee, the Executive Yuan, and the Ministry of Education for earnest appeal.</p>

<p>[Reported by this city] More than 200 teachers and staff members of the ten municipal middle schools in this city, because the salaries were low and insufficient to cover expenses, held a general meeting at Yucai Middle School on Shanhaiguan Road the day before yesterday, and unanimously agreed to request the treatment of the bottom salary at the end of the Republic of China in the twenty-sixth year according to the current cost of living index, and sent a letter to the principals and petitioned the municipal government. Yesterday (February 27) at 10 am, they specially appointed six representatives to the municipal government to petition Mayor Qian. The Secretary-General Shen Shihua received them. For the requests of the teachers, he agreed to the same treatment as the municipal government officials, that is, 100 times the base salary plus a subsidy of 30,000 yuan, and another six buckets of white rice, but the representatives were not satisfied. It is now heard that the teachers and staff will gather again to discuss the method.</p>

<p>Thoughts</p>
<h3 id="e77">A Woman's Talent is Virtue (Part 1) <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>— Yang Tongfang</p>
<p>Under the so-called "wise saying" of ancient sages, "A woman's lack of talent is a virtue," countless female geniuses have been buried, and countless women have been deprived of educational opportunities.</p>
<p>For thousands of years, Chinese women have been shackled by the terrible old ethics, without any freedom. The rulers of society in general, as well as the "great scholars" in the scholar-official class, in order to oppress and enslave women, first prevented women from having the opportunity to be educated, creating inequality of knowledge between men and women. Because of the inequality of knowledge, everything else naturally became unequal as well. Since women's status could not be equal to men's, they were always subordinate to men, becoming "playthings" in the hands of men. Men could use the term "chastity" to block the source of women's emotions, while men could openly take concubines without being subject to public criticism. Irresponsible men who seduced and abandoned women could ignore the consequences. Therefore, in feudal society, women were sheep for men to slaughter at will. The "wise saying" "A woman's lack of talent is a virtue," which has been regarded as an irrefutable truth for thousands of years, is even more of a shackle used by those "great scholars" who defend the Way to confine women. Countless women have been sacrificed beneath it.</p>
<p>A Saying That Should Have Been Abandoned Long Ago</p>
<p>Times have changed, and this "saying" seems to have been eliminated invisibly. In today's advocacy of equal rights for men and women, and in today's promotion of equal educational opportunities for men and women, we naturally do not allow such ideas to exist anymore. However, contemporary Chinese society still exhibits semi-feudal characteristics, and all incorrect traditional concepts have not been completely eradicated. Just like this "saying" that has confined Chinese women for thousands of years, there are still people who believe it is the truth. Those who claim to advocate "education for virtuous wives and good mothers" still take this "saying" that should have been abandoned long ago as the basis of their thinking. We cannot deny the progress of women's education in the past fifty years, but women's intellectual status is still inferior to that of men. While there are various reasons for this, there is one point we absolutely cannot deny: most people in society misunderstand the purpose of education. They believe that women's education is merely a kind of embellishment, a kind of decoration. How many people believe that women study for "practical application"? How many people believe that women can achieve the same intellectual status as men through studying? The idea that "a diploma is for the sake of makeup" seems to resonate with many people.</p>
<p>Not only in China, but even in countries like Germany and France, where women's education can be considered developed, there is still a widespread call to "go to the kitchen." The "bride schools" in America specialize in providing future brides with knowledge about household management and raising children, as if women's "talent" can only develop to the extent of the kitchen and the bridal chamber. In fact, women's nature and function are certainly suitable for handling household affairs, but on the other hand, we must urgently expand the scope of women's education. Especially in today's China, after eight years of the War of Resistance, we have finally won victory, and we are about to embark on the journey of national construction, marching towards the great road of building a new China. We need countless knowledgeable women to work together with men to serve the country and society, and to seek the welfare of the people. To achieve this goal, we must first correct the misconceptions that most people have about women's education, and expand the goals of education to the greatest extent possible, allowing women to freely enrich their knowledge and skills, and have the opportunity to satisfy their desire for knowledge.</p>
<p>The Ability to Adapt and Live</p>
<p>We must abolish the reactionary slogan "A woman's lack of talent is a virtue" and replace it with "A woman's talent is virtue." Here, "talent" refers to a person's ability to adapt to life. This is a broad definition, including all knowledge and skills necessary for daily life. True knowledge and skills must be combined with practice to have meaning. By opening up a path between theory and practice, one can naturally adapt well to self-governance and thereby improve life. In this way, from the individual to society, from the small self to the large self, we can surely push the world of mankind towards a bright future. Even if we disregard the country and society (in reality, improving the individual also improves the country and society), a woman with abundant knowledge and skills will surely be of greater help in managing the household and raising children. This is without question. How to manage one's household in an orderly and appropriate manner, and how to ensure that one's children receive good family education (men naturally also have a responsibility in managing the household and raising children) – these all require sufficient knowledge and skills, and are not something that just anyone can do. Letting ignorant and clueless women handle household management and raising children will never work. Moreover, the relationship between the country and society and the individual is extremely deep and important. Women in the future will no longer be "playthings" confined to high-rise buildings and subordinate to men; they should be conscious "members of society" and should recognize their position and responsibilities in society and even in the human race.</p>
<p>Intentional and United Action</p>
<p>As for "virtue," it refers broadly to the term "morality." This includes "moral conduct" and "character." According to the research of modern ethicists, the meaning of morality is extremely broad. What people regarded as moral in the past has now lost its relevance to the times and no longer has moral value. Of course, humanity also has common objective moral standards that can have relatively lasting value. However, morality is always a product of society, and the changes of the times and the evolution of society can change people's concepts of morality at any time. Morality is a rule of conduct; the rule of conscious common action that arises among the members of society to meet common needs is morality. In primitive society, it was believed that morality came from God's commands and that the concept of morality was bestowed by God. In this way, morality was clothed in the garb of religion. As the people's wisdom grew, morality was recognized as an instruction of "reason." People believed that besides the physical self, there was a "rational self." Although this argument broke away from the religious color of "God," it still does not conform to modern ethical concepts.</p>
<p>American psychologist S. Fischir argues that the development of an individual's morality often develops along with the development of the individual's self-awareness. It expands from the self, and the scope of moral concepts grows larger. The growth of the individual and the influence of the environment are the conditions for the formation of moral behavior. According to the analysis of general scholars, high-level knowledge must first be present to form a kind of moral behavior as a basis for reasoning and judgment. Socrates said, "Knowledge is virtue." A Western proverb says, "Most suffering comes from ignorance than from malice." Kant also said, "Knowledge is a mirror that reflects our behavior." Indeed, knowledge is very important, although we cannot deny the importance of good habits and strong willpower in forming moral behavior.</p>

<h3 id="e78">How to Deal with Children <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>— Xian</p>
<p>Children are innocent, naturally have a submissive heart, and in their little minds, they generally harbor a subconscious belief that "adults always know more than I do." Therefore, when instructing or exhorting them, one should always adopt a kind and amiable attitude, so-called earnest and patient guidance. There is no need to resort to stern words and harsh expressions. Sometimes, excessive scolding only makes them become "naughty" or even stubborn!</p>
<p>Children are naturally fond of playing, and sometimes they get their hands and faces extremely dirty. This is not their fault. You should clean them up afterwards and tell them that dirty things should not be put in the mouth and that they should wash their hands before eating. Next time, they will wash their hands themselves!</p>
<p>Do not point out their faults in front of others, as this will damage their self-esteem.</p>
<p>When children encounter things they do not understand and ask questions, you should answer and explain them in detail. However, you must not do the homework or exercises they bring back from school for them, so as to avoid fostering dependence.</p>
<p>When giving medicine to children, do not deceive them by saying it is sweet. This teaches them to deceive, and it will not work next time. It is better to persuade them properly, saying that taking this medicine will make the illness go away quickly and their bodies will not be uncomfortable anymore. The effect will be better.</p>
<p>Do not easily grant children's requests. If you grant them, do not forget to give them what they asked for, so as to cultivate their habit of keeping promises.</p>
<p>Kindness and love are good, but too much of them turns into spoiling.</p>
<p>Do not dress children in clothes that are too fancy or elaborate, as this will cultivate their extravagance.</p>

<p>— Ouli</p>
<p>British Food Minister Sir Ben Smith has specially stipulated that the ration cards of pregnant women should be printed with the words "Queue Priority Please" in order to give preferential treatment to pregnant women in collecting rationed food. Pregnant women who receive this kind of ration card have the right to go to the front of the line when queuing in front of stores in London.</p>
<p>This kind of preferential treatment for pregnant women could also be emulated in our country.</p>
<h3 id="e80">Waste Utilization <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>— Jianru</p>
<p>In this society where all prices are rising endlessly, every family is always worried about the difficulty of life, constantly thinking about how to "increase income" and how to "reduce expenditure." One of the slogans of the New Life Movement is: "Be diligent to increase income, and be thrifty to reduce expenditure." Naturally, being able to utilize waste can add up to a considerable amount over the years! Now I will write down a few usable items:</p>
<p>(1) Soap ends: Collect the soap ends that are left over. When you have accumulated a lot, dissolve the soap ends in lard, add some salt, and simmer it into a paste. Pour it into a mold, and after it solidifies, take it out and cut it into soap.</p>
<p>(2) Rags: Scraps of old clothes or fabric can be accumulated and used to make mops. The ones sold in the market are also made of rags.</p>
<p>(3) Shells: Shells can be used as dye. Just put the shells you have eaten, add some green alum, put them in a pot, and boil them with water to dye plain-colored clothing materials.</p>
<p>(4) Old leather shoe soles: Old leather shoe soles are very useful. It is very appropriate to repurpose them to make women's shoe soles or children's shoe soles.</p>
<p>(5) Rice straw ash: The ash burned every day seems useless, but if you use it to scrub copper pots and utensils, you can make old ones look new. Alternatively, you can soak it in water to make a lye, and use the lye to wash clothes. Its function is like that of soap, which can remove dirt; it can also be used as fertilizer.</p>

<h3 id="e81">Homemade Little Cape <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>— Cangmei</p>
<p>Children are very wasteful when it comes to clothes. We can find a large piece of old clothing and, with a little effort, turn it into a practical and economical fashionable garment. Capes are very popular now, and I think it is very convenient for little girls to wear capes. Because in winter, if they wear a padded robe and then add a coat, they will inevitably look bulky. A cape is simple and chic.</p>
<p>The dimensions (in feet) of the cape in the drawing are suitable for a five- or six-year-old girl to wear.</p>
<p>Material: Preferably wool fabric. If you use old clothes, just iron the reverse side flat, and it will look as good as new. The material for the piping around the neckline and armholes should be chosen with diagonal checks or bright colors. This can highlight a plain, dark-colored fabric. As for the lining, you can use old materials.</p>
<p>Method: Cut according to the dimensions in the drawing. First sew the pleats and joining points with needle and thread, and then use a machine to stitch along the dotted lines. Join the two pieces on the front, left and right, and then sew them into a cape shape. Attach the hood. Make two shoulder pads (sew them into dumpling shapes, line them with cotton, and pad them on the shoulders). Then attach the lining. (The cutting of the lining can be simpler. The back can be cut into a flat piece, without pleats; the front can be cut by joining the two pieces into one.) After the whole garment is finished, apply the piping. The total length of the piping around the body is about eighty-two inches, and the length of the piping around the sleeve openings is five inches. Sew hooks and eyes on the neckline, and sew two round buttons and a button loop to fasten it. Then a simple and practical cape is complete. You may wish to try making one from an adult's old clothes first. The dimensions can be enlarged or reduced according to the size of the child.</p>

<h3 id="e82">"Mahjong" That Consumes Life <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>— Suoyin</p>
<p>"Mahjong" is a pastime that consumes life! Because "time is the stuff that life is made of" (Franklin), consuming time is consuming life, and playing mahjong is the most time-consuming activity, so it is also the most life-consuming.</p>
<p>Chinese society has always presented this contradictory phenomenon: "People have nothing to do, and there is no one to do things." Playing mahjong is one of the most common manifestations of people having nothing to do. Of course, this phenomenon occurs not because there is truly nothing to do, but because people do not know how to do things or are unwilling to do them. This is a very terrible phenomenon. The Ming dynasty perished due to Ma Diao, the predecessor of mahjong. This time, China has suffered an unprecedented disaster, and mahjong is not without its contribution. Because the trend of playing mahjong has been extremely rampant in the past few decades, Mr. Hu Shih once calculated that the total time spent on playing mahjong across the country every day is at least 167,000 days! Just imagine if this much time were used to do other things that would benefit society, the family, or the individual, wouldn't its achievements be very impressive? Accumulate it over a year, over decades, wouldn't its achievements be even more astonishing? Naturally, the fruits of these achievements would be the progress of society and the strength of the country. Now, spending this precious time on playing mahjong, the results obtained are of course the opposite, and the occurrence of national disasters is not accidental.</p>
<p>However, what is even more heartbreaking is that today, after the cooperation of the Allied powers led to the victory of the War of Resistance, when every citizen should be shouldering a part of the work of national construction, the evil trend of playing mahjong still prevails in all social strata, from the upper class to the middle class to the lower class!</p>
<p>Moreover, playing mahjong not only wastes time, but also cultivates a person's gambling mentality, selfishness, and affects the relationship between relatives and friends. What's worse is that because of worrying about gains and losses, it causes people's psychology to become abnormal. When they win, they become ecstatic and want to use the ill-gotten wealth to have fun. Thus, eating, drinking, playing, and all kinds of bad habits begin to form. If they lose, they become dejected, make excuses to be angry, and can't sleep or eat well because they want to "win back their losses." Fortunately, they win back their capital. If they quit from now on, that would be good. But due to the effect of their compensatory psychology (compensating for some mental loss), they are unwilling to stop there and want to win a little more. But if they lose again, will they stop there? No, because they then develop the desire to "gain even more after having achieved one's initial aims." In this way, they always want to win back their losses when they lose and always want to win more when they win, and the cycle continues endlessly. They can never extricate themselves. This is the common psychology of engaging in any kind of gambling, and it is not only true of playing mahjong.</p>
<p>But this mind-consuming and time-wasting pastime is not only loved by men, but women play it even more enthusiastically. Because men always have to go out to work, women, especially the ladies, wives, and misses of the leisure class, can entrust all the housework to servants and devote all their energy and time to playing mahjong without any problems. Even housewives in middle- and lower-class families, who do not have servants to entrust their housework to, will handle the housework and children with extremely "economical" methods: they will buy some snacks to save themselves the trouble of cooking; they will pile up dirty clothes and bedding without washing them first; they will let the dust accumulate thickly in the room without cleaning it; they will leave their belongings in disarray without tidying them up; they will let their children wander on the streets, fight in the alleys, and commit mischief without disciplining or educating them, and they will free up time to engage in playing mahjong. I really don't understand how "mahjong" can be so bewitching!</p>
<p>But I believe that most gamblers understand that they are knowingly committing the act, so this is not something that can be effective through persuasion with words. It is necessary to find constructive pastimes and entertainment to replace it. Because the Chinese people have always lacked good hobbies due to the lack of progress in their thinking and the low level of education, such as the various ball games, swimming, hiking, reading, stamp collecting, and music that Europeans and Americans love. At the same time, due to environmental factors, legitimate pastimes and entertainment are restricted, such as the lack of parks, sports grounds, libraries, and various amateur organizations. Therefore, mahjong has gained the right time and place and has become a popular hobby.</p>
<p>The author has long believed that to eradicate the evil trend of housewives playing mahjong, it is necessary to rely on the power of the community. It would be best if knowledgeable women in each neighborhood led the organization of a kind of community, such as a friendship society, targeting women in one neighborhood or one alley as the organizational object -- the scope of the organization may be small, as this makes it easier to manage. The clubhouse should have books, newspapers, magazines, entertainment equipment, etc., and regular lectures or seminars and home visits should be held to instill women with various necessary knowledge, such as household affairs, hygiene, child psychology and education, and women's self-cultivation. Sometimes, group trips or visits can be arranged, and sometimes educational exhibitions can be held. During festivals, it is also possible to hold a fun fair or a concert. In short, anything that can increase women's knowledge and add to their legitimate interests can be introduced to improve their intellectual level, cultivate their noble hobbies, correct their bad lifestyles, and achieve the goal of eradicating the evil trend of playing mahjong.</p>

<h3 id="e83">The Diaper Problem in the Soviet Union <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>— Translated by Xiao Shuzhuang</p>
<p>I was overjoyed. My wife gave birth to a son.</p>
<p>When this little guy, born in the maternity hospital, is ready to go home, what is the most needed thing? Obviously, diapers.</p>
<p>First, the maternity hospital wrote a certificate proving that the child was born alive.</p>
<p>"Go to the women's examination room to get his diapers," they told me. When I got to the examination room, they said:</p>
<p>"You need to have a residence certificate from the landlord of your current residence; you also need a power of attorney when picking up diapers."</p>
<p>"Who will guarantee me?" I asked in surprise. "This baby?"</p>
<p>"The mother can issue a power of attorney," they replied.</p>
<p>So I ran to find the landlord and ran back to the maternity hospital to collect these certificates.</p>
<p>I returned to the examination room. This time, three certificates were exchanged for a new certificate. They mercifully told me:</p>
<p>"Send it to where your wife works."</p>
<p>When I got to where my wife works, my son was registered. Now that I have the records, certificates, etc., I went to the allocation card distribution office. There, I received a card for collecting diapers.</p>
<p>Holding up this small green card, I couldn't help but think: if someone came up with a good idea to supply diapers—or at least diaper ration cards—directly from the maternity hospital, then what would these kind gentlemen have to do?</p>
<p>On the seventh day after my son was born, he, wearing new shrouds, was allowed to be discharged from the hospital. When leaving the hospital, they handed me a slip of paper, saying:</p>
<p>"Here is your certificate for collecting soap."</p>
<p>The little fellow is already over two months old, and that soap collection certificate has only just turned into a bar of soap. It wasn't thrown away. This certificate first ran to the landlord, from there it was directed to the women's examination room, and then back to the landlord. Then it ran to the mother's workplace, from there to the allocation card distribution office, from there to the father's workplace, and then back to the allocation card distribution office, and finally back to the maternity hospital.</p>
<p>It wasn't just the certificate. It has been running around to these places, and the father accompanied it. This is the use of fathers.</p>
<p>On the back of the certificate, the following statement is printed: "The soap allocation card should be collected directly from within the maternity hospital. Printed by Kutzneitsov, Director of the Allocation Card Distribution Office." Just below this, we see again: "Submit this certificate to the department in charge of collecting other allocation cards, and you will immediately obtain a soap allocation card. (Signature, illegible)"</p>
<p>However, we did eventually get the bar of soap, but I kept the certificate. When my son grows up and is able to do things, I will show him this little piece of paper and say to him, "Child, tear it up! Remember, in your life, never issue such a certificate or write such a statement. You must treat your fellow countrymen like human beings!"</p>
<p>The above article is translated from the January 1946 issue of Reader's Digest, originally written by Yefirn Urhunsky. During the War of Resistance, compatriots in the occupied areas tasted the bitterness of the rationing system under the enemy and puppet governments. Due to the oppression of life and the rise in prices, they had to swallow their anger and be ordered around to fill out a form here and get a ration ticket there. The procedures were truly numerous. Housewives were even more endlessly troubled, having to constantly remember when and where to collect items such as rice tickets, flour tickets, sugar tickets, oil tickets, coal briquette tickets, cloth tickets, etc. They had to squeeze and be jostled, and they would either run in vain or spend money to get things that they couldn't eat, couldn't use, or that weren't enough to share. After reading this article, I deeply sympathize with the experiences of this Soviet author.</p>

<h3 id="e84">Remembering <a href="#e84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>— Shuyi</p>
<p>Living with children is truly a joy in life. Watching their innocent and lively behavior and their carefree faces seems to make me younger. Sometimes, when my heart is clearly disturbed by the turmoil of the world and immersed in the abyss of sorrow, it will disappear like smoke upon seeing the cordial and lovely children. Learning together with them every day seems to bring me back to the golden age of the past.</p>
<p>In the eyes of the children, I am as dignified as an emperor. My words are the law for the children. Their lives and emotions change with my will. I seem to live in a world created by myself. Although parenting is strenuous and often causes anxiety, afterwards, nothing is on my mind. It is like the reconciliation with my brothers after getting angry at home. If I can see their behavior or studies gradually improving, then the joy in my heart is truly indescribable, and I will cherish this child especially.</p>
<p>Now, illness has kept me away from them for almost two years. Two years of separation have increased my attachment even more. I miss every one of them, and they certainly won't have forgotten me either. If my health and circumstances allow it in the future, I would still like to do this old job again, get along with innocent children, and live a hard but warm school life.</p>
