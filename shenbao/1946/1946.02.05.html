<p>社論</p>
<h3>農民節爲農民訴苦</h3>
<p>昨日爲農民節，社會部部長谷正綱氏特向農民廣播，對濃民爲國家爲民族偉大的犧牲和貢獻，表示崇敬和慰問；並希望全國民有民努力三事：（一）擁護和平統一，經確立建國秩序：（二）參加農村自治，以實現農村政治的民主；（三）改革農村經濟，以這實現農村經濟的民主。關於第一點，谷氏說：「在抗戰勝利以後，國家需要的是建設和平統一。現在最足以妨礙我們國家建設的，就是社會的紛亂，與國家的分裂；社會紛亂，國家分裂的表現，乃爲各地土匪的紛擾，和軍事勢力的割據。今我我們　使國家走上和平建國的途徑，惟有打破這種危害國家的紛亂與割據的現象。最近政治協商會議決定一個和平建國綱領，其中最重要的幾項原則，是遵奉三民主義爲建國的最高指導原則，全國力量在蔣主席領導下，團結一致，建設統一自由民主的新中國，我們更希望全國農民去促進這些原則的實現」·我們買了谷部長對全國農民的廣播，深覺政府對於農民福利的關注。農民節的設立，就表示政府如何關　　農民的一番至讓出。查農民節之設立係由於三十年三月二十二日，在全國農林行政會議所通過，用以惑謝農民從事抗戰之功跡。昨日之農民節爲抗戰勝利後首屆令節。我們在春回大地陽光普照人間度過此節，誠不免感觸多端。</p>
<p>中國主要是一個以農民構成的國家；農民是中國人口中的骨幹。我們過去八年的長期抗戰之所以能够獲得勝利結束，雖其間原因並不單純，但主要還是由農民的貢獻。中國的兵，多數來自農村；農村子弟使我們的兵源不致枯竭，終之使我們勝利地完遂了我們偉大的愛國戰爭，這是衆所周知的事。由於農民的辛勸，使我們在艱苦的長期戰爭下，無糧食匱乏的憂慮，使我們得以致力於戰事的進行，這也是衆所周知的事。單是這兩點，中國的農民，對抗戰的貢獻，實在太大了。然而在這兩點以外，還有更重要而未被衆所周知的一點，這就是在我們進行長期的抗戰中，我國民族經濟之所以能免於崩潰，主要還是由於農村。我國的農村經濟支持了我們八年的長期抗戰。中國的農民於從軍及耕種以外，還致力於它種生產；由於這種種生產，使抗戰得以完遂勝利。舉一個例說吧，在海口封鎖交通困難的戰時情形下，各地農民完全努力於製造土紙，使在內地的報紙，出版業，乃至全部文化活動不致停頓。這種種對於抗戰的貢獻實在太大了。在抗戰勝利後第一屆的農民節，我們首先要對我們的農民，致其深切之謝忱。</p>
<p>然而中國的農民却漫不介意地沈默無言地工作在他們的田間，在他們的鄉村。他們自己並不了然於他們對抗戰的貢獻，也不了然於我們的稱謝。個個都像是無名英雄默默無言地辛動地工作着。他們眞是我們民族的生命·我們向他們說：「多謝你們的貢獻，使抗戰勝利了。」他們不懂，他們不理會。在他們淳樸的談吐中，沈重的脚步聲中，他們曉得他們過的是怎樣的一種生活。年老的人，在吃了一口畢烟，喝了一口茶之後，會歡一口氣，說一聲「這些日子眞難過啊！」之類的話。的確，在慶祝晨民節的時候，我們實在不應忘却中國農民的苦痛。如何能使他們的實際生活有點改善，纔不負國家明定農民節的一番深意。</p>
<p>令日中國的農民所受到的痛苦太深了。地主的剝削是衆所周知的事。然而比地主剝削更甚的還有政府的官吏。自從田賦改徵實物以來，糧政當局對於農民的苛擾，實在罄竹難書。在糧政最高當局，原沒有使農民爲難的木意，可是糧政機構的曆疊，下吏的橫行不法，結果受到苛擾的還是可憐無告的農民，也就是在農民節我們要對他們表示感謝的農民。在勝利後欣逢第一屆農民節，我們爲農民訴苦，第一要請政府撤廢現有的糧政機構，並要求澈查糧政機構屬吏橫行不法欺凌農民的罪行，予以嚴辦。</p>
<p>此外，農民所担負的稅捐實在太煩苛了。田賦不必說，農民背幾根竹進城來要納稅，帶點雞鴨進城來要納稅·一行一動，樣樣須納稅。「鄉愚無知」，便覺得政府捐稅的煩苛，而幾乎樣樣取諸農民：這在政府實在是一件不智的事。國民革命進行北伐的時候，曾有「取消苛捐雜稅」的口號，然而目今的「苛捐雜稅」，依舊苛而且雜。「農民節爲農民訴苦」，我們要請政府廢正對於農民所徵收的苛捐雜稅。</p>
<p>上之所陳，我政府旣關懷農民福利，深信必能逐一付諸實施。在今日全國盛倡「工業化」的呼號下，我們於歲首度過晨民節，其意義尤爲深長。的確，我們今後的建國，得走向「工業化」，但我們不可或忘農產畢竟爲立國之本。我們今後的建國是有計劃的建國，工農必須並重。在農業的範疇內，我們允不可忘記農民主義之首要在民生，而民生主義之基本爲「耕者有其田」。今後大家旣奉三民主義爲建國的最高原則，更須做到耕者要「有」其田。至關於農事之改進，農氏生活之改善，切忌抄襲成法，認爲在外國辦得通的，中國亦必能辦通；須於顧全客觀事實之中，對國外成法爲必要之適應。必如此，農民　能眞正復到實惠。</p>
<h3>魏道明將與美談判　借款地十億美元　擬用於復與及工業發展</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓四日電〕杜魯一門總統已咨請國會核准美國對英借款三十七億五千萬元一案。據悉此舉可使其他積累繼起請求同樣借款，各國或不待國會通過，即提出請求，預料中國將居前列。中國駐美大使魏道明返渝述職後，已道途回任，一般人猜測，魏大使或已奉有訓令，與美國開始談判大借款，借款數目至少當達二十億美元。據中國官場宣稱：，此借款如獲允准，將用於中國善後問題及振與工商業，尤重在原有工業之現代化其他工業之發展。中國將盡量憑藉自己力量，以謀復與興工業化，但因資力有限，如欲在政治社會及工業方面確立穩固基礎，殆難負此重任。最近杜魯門總統曾宣布，中國政局安定後，美國於對華放款問題，自將優與考慮，是則美國對華態度，即此可見一斑。</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓三日電〕前美國駐滬商務參贊書記史密斯女士，在紐的出口廣告商俱樂部發展演說稱：中國今日正由手工業轉入技術訓練及科學硏究，俾在世界主要國家間爭得一席穩固地位此於美國貨物及製造方法造成更多機會。現有中國技術人員一千餘名，正在美國工商各業實習，中國學校內亦有數萬人正在訓練中，皆爲中國進步之前鋒，中國對於廣告藝術有極商鑑別力，中國各地出版物，亦正在不斷增加中。</p>

<h3>贛省交通復員工程　本年底方可完成　恢復粵漢路至少需兩年</h3>
<p>〔中央社南昌四日電〕贛省交通復員工作，因工料不齊，全部工程的需本年底方可完成，尤以橋梁工程，因破壞澈底，需料更多，迄未能籌得適當供應辦法。現閩贛綫南城至臨川段已通車，臨川至南昌段的三月底通車，贛浙綫寗都鷹潭段照常通車，贛湘棧即將恢復戰前路綫，由牛行經萬載而達湘省之瀏陽，長沙，與川湘綫啣接。但此綫贛境各段工程，尚未動工，仍循界化壟入湘，照常通車。贛粤綫原由南昌經吉安贛縣入粤，現以南昌吉安間路工尚未完成，改由循寗都贛縣大庾入粵。水路交通去多水個航行困難，潯與吉贛間雖有私人經營之小汽輪行駛，然以水淺運費價昻，旅人亦多感不便。目前南潯米市狂漲，雖有多種原因，然交通阻隔，實亦其原因之一。</p>

<p>﹝本報訊﹞據倫敦四日廣播稱：在今日安全理事會中，美代表史退丁紐斯建議，該會對於蘇聯反對英軍留駐希臘一事，暫勿採取正式行動，同時並請求英蘇希三國勿再對此事，再有所行動。又希臘代表阿區第士稱，英軍留駐希臘，純係「內部問題」，希望安全理事在希臘未舉行大選前，暫勿討論該問題。</p>
<p>﹝聯合社倫敦四日電﹞聯合國安全理事會今日開會，對希臘糾紛重加考慮，預料蘇聯與英國互相指責對方危害世界和平，或將引起第二次衝突，亦未可必，蘇外次維辛斯基上星期五會與英外相貝文直言相辯，料想維辛斯基即將要求英軍撤退希臘。多數代表相信截至目前爲止，維辛斯基尙隱忍不發，今日或將單刀直入，切實表明蘇聯政府立塲，大多數代表認希臘糾紛成立妥協希望甚微。</p>

<h3>日本不復神秘　內幕完全暴露</h3>
<p>〔路擔社東家四日電〕以前世界　神秘之國家日本，今已成爲藍軍官員之「公開書結」，美國陸軍部情報觀搜集關於日本之文件，已逾一千五百種，當盟軍登陸之初，技術情報人員，即首先檢查日本之兵工廠，其後陸海軍諜報組及科學家，亦紛紛出動搜索以下乃軍事情報人員之若干重要收穫，日本之襲擊潛艇空中魚雷，係以滑翔原理而發明，惟日本以缺乏必需之旋轉儀，故至一九四四年即放棄空中魚雷之工作。日本於一九四四年，曾自德國獲得製造硬炭飛機及火箭機燃料之基本計劃，乃即設廠自造，然以技術人才及原料之缺乏，而全部工作記錄又於盟軍炸東京時被毀，工作遂無形停頓·日本民氣至戰爭結束時猶極旺盛，良以日本人民不知戰爭末期，戰局如何變化之故，惟以對於勝利目標缺乏統一之利益，遂不免漸成分裂之局面，其他關於日本之政黨，神社人造橡皮·自殺戰術·黑市·廣播。及捕鯨等，美國情報人員，均已探知其內幕·</p>
<h3>埃及朝野堅決要求　英駐軍全中撤退　法魯克王與英使間裂痕日深　埃國民黨反對英埃修約談判</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦四日電〕英國答覆埃及關於要求英軍撤退事之照會，已使埃及之政潮延期爆發，而英埃利益之衝突亦不致遽形尖銳化，當埃及政府首次提出英軍完全撤退之特殊要求，而英國駐埃大使基能勳爵向其提出答覆時，危機之發生在意料之中。埃及之政局決不久許任何政府能繼續存在或維持良好秩序，除非該政府能就要求英軍撤退事提出强硬之要求，任何政府未能在此方面努力者，必將引起與論之攻擊，亦難博埃王攘魯克之好感。據云，埃王曾訓令內閣，囑其作撤兵之要求，二十六齡之法魯克王已潮成埃及政治上之重要人物，其地位似已駕內閣而上之·同時埃王與英國大使間之裂痕，似亦漸趨擴大，　中及關係方面咸謂埃王與英使間之關係，自二月十九日以來即日趨緊張，自埃王免除前總理那哈斯之職務後，埃王與華孚特黨之關係即呈分離。法魯克王現力圖獲取民衆之支持，以對抗華孚特黨之領袖，後者在民衆之壓力下，不但希望重取政權，且主張更深刻之社會改革，故如埃王過於固執，則不免成其攻擊目標。苟目前之諾克拉茜政府不能令人滿意，則埃王常設法避免其本身地位之受危。總之，埃及國內之民族思想已極爲濃厚，民意咸主英軍退出埃及，並與蘇丹合併。此次英國之答覆雖能延危機於一時，然終難令埃人甘心</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社三日開羅電〕埃及國民黨領袖即前總理那哈斯本日宣稱：英國與埃及現政府所簽訂之任何協定，均非國民黨所能承認，我國旣未被邀參加對義和的之簽訂，勢難提出收回失地之要求，此事尤非吾人所能苟同云。此外據消息變通人士所知，又有英軍一批在亞歷山大港登陸，預料最短期內尙有其他部隊繼續開到。</p>

<p>〔路透社德黑蘭四日電〕伊朗報紙今日載稱：蘇聯政府已通知伊朗總理沙丹納，吿以蘇政府準備接受伊朗使命團，在莫斯科就亞塞爾拜然事件，從事直接談判。</p>
<p>〔聯合社倫敦三日電〕伊朗問題初步談判，已在倫敦開始，伊朗前總理斯希萊隨聯合國大會伊朗代表團來此，曾與蘇聯首席代表維辛斯基一度會談，惟大致僅屬互相酬酢之辭。</p>
<p>〔路透社倫四日電〕「觀察報」論稱：聯合國安全理事會已決定將伊蘇糾紛，交當事國直接談判，蘇政府當不願令此等談判再度失敗。蘇聯之需要，應以溫和爲主，俾能爲大多數伊朗人民所接受，如能供給伊朗所需要之若干物資，則尤爲妥當。蘇聯之需要，最主要者當爲伊北石油開採權之讓與，其次即爲在亞塞爾拜然設立蘇維埃型之政權，等於一省之獨立。蓋以蘇聯之巴庫油田及油管接近該地，故草斯科希望能以亞塞爾拜然成爲其屏障。再其次即爲改組中央政府，使成中央集權而更進步之政府，最好能與羅馬尼亞與保加利亞之政府相仿，英人有謂蘇聯在伊北勢力之伸張，爲英國外交上之失敗者，其實不然，蘇聯雖在伊北獲得採油權，並推動地方及無產階級之利益，然而英國在伊朗南部仍可發動農業及社會福利事務以對抗之。英國在整個中東之地位，其實均與此相似，叙利亞黎巴嫩甚至伊拉克，均希望英人退出，英國在中東已有近六十年之歷史，然而在社會福利方面確缺乏顯著建樹，目前如能爲亡羊補牢之計，猶不得謂爲過遲也</p>

<h3>靑年軍入伍周年　觀光雄師受檢</h3>
<p>— 潔</p>
<p>一年前，在我們賢明的領袖號召之下，全國各地知識靑年風起雲湧，投筆從戒，不到三月竟超過了十萬的預定目標，當時抗戰正在最艱難段，他們抱定了爲國犧牲的精神，在大後方受着最嚴格的訓練，準備和敵人拼個你死我活，誰知出師有日，敵人竟全面投降了，使這去新中國的「雄師」未遂夙願。</p>
<p>昨天正是「雄師」入伍一週年紀念日，靑年遠征軍二〇七師特地在北四川路底中正公園內舉行一個盛大的閱兵典禮來紀念他，未到一時，全師官兵全副武裝精神飽滿，已列隊等候着檢閱，市民專程前往參觀的約有數千人，其中還有從江灣趕來的農民。</p>
<p>一時廿分閱兵儀式開始，先由新六軍軍長廖耀湘，靑年軍二〇七師師長羅又倫陪同錢市長大鈞，吳主委紹澍，副市長何德奎，副司令李及蘭，敎育局長　毓琇，市商會理事長王曉籟導於軍樂聲中檢閱一週後，登閱兵台，當分列式行經閱兵台時，不禁使每個參觀的人報以熱烈的掌聲，的確步伐太齊整了，同時每個都有健全的體格，一切象徵着未來新中國的光明。</p>
<p>檢閱完畢，首由錢市長致訓詞，略謂：「去年三月廿日本人曾隨從委座由渝飛昆，在北校場檢閱諸君一次，那時。委座對你們的生活及訓練狀况，非常關切。至於靑年軍產生在前年秋天，敵人正在瘋狂進攻的時候，委座感到國革素質欠佳，訓練不够，才發動十萬靑年從軍，把全國知識靑年編成十師，所有裝備給養莫不盡力提高，並予嚴格訓練，務使成爲素質高於一切的生力軍，用以摧減敵人，去年八月抗戰勝利，本人今日又得與二〇七師士兵相見，甚感愉快，今後在建國必先建軍的前提下，諸君責任重大，深望每個士兵，勿辜負委座一番訓導誠意，注意前程，確守紀律，鍛鍊體格，使人人成爲建軍的幹部。」</p>
<p>接着敎育局長顧毓琇，市商會理事長王曉籟，新六軍軍長廖耀湘，二〇七師師長羅又倫等致詞，語多勉勵，典禮於二時三刻吿終，然而參觀的市民包圍着「雄師」不願散去，最後他們臨時推出幾位同志，表演了一套刺槍技術，獲得了全場的叫好。</p>

<h3>新春話賭</h3>
<p>— 朱君宜</p>
<p>「官」的新年已過，現在乃是「民」的新年。</p>
<p>「官」的國歷新年，向來就找不出什麼新的氣息，所有的祗是：掛國旗，各機關的國拜，報紙出特刊，休假一天，以外沒有了。「民」的廢歷新年卻大大的不同，所謂爆竹一聲除舊，桃符萬戶更新，每一個人都用了全副氣力來消磨這一年僅有幾天的佳節。吾鄉浙西有兩句形容新年的俗語：「吃他個漲，賭他個暢。」可見廢歷新年中並列的兩件大事，就祗有「吃」和「賭」。</p>
<p>前幾天大家都已在忙着吃的工作了，南貨店裏辦年貨的整天擠得水泄不通，不過今年天不作美，氣候很燠暖，多備了卻恐怕自己受用不到，所以我也丟開「吃」，且來話「賭」。</p>
<p>過去每逢廢歷新年，官府對於民間的賭，照例抱着眼開眼閉，不加干涉的態度，於是平常不大賭的，新年無事，也就來湊上一腳。喜歡賭的，更要乘此狂賭一番，有錢的固然要賭，窮人亦必弄幾個賭本來碰碰運氣，大人在賭，小孩子身上有的是壓歲錢，便也擠在中間軋起鬧猛來。不但家家戶戶關緊了大門，沉迷於骨牌骰子之中，東也「劈劈拍」，西也「擦朗朗」。馬路上也多出各式俱全的賭攤，引誘着那批下層人物。這簡直成了一個賭的世界。</p>
<p>過去敵偽時代，更有賭窟之設立，當時不知有多少人沉迷於此而致傾家蕩產，馬路上也憑空添增了無數由賭徒化身的癟三，記得本市某著名茶號小開一夜在賭窟中竟輸去了一爿總店，十三爿分店，這樣的豪賭，就是世界聞名的澳洲某賭國的百姓聽了，想來也要甘拜下風，自嘆「起碼」。</p>
<p>最近各地當局實行新生活運動而嚴厲禁賭，聽說杭州提到賭徒之後，罰他們　了牌桌環城遊街示眾，這個辦法，倒覺得新鮮有趣，這次廢歷新年中，本市警局大可廢棄「打手心」，而仿行此法，捉上幾十個賭徒來一次集團大遊街，着實比掉龍燈還要好看得多。</p>
<p>總而言之，賭博總不是一件好事，打起官話來，「勞民傷財」，確實應當予以澈底禁絕，不過有一點卻不得不加注意，就是販夫走卒的賭固然要禁，躱在大洋房裏達官貴人巨當富賈的賭，更其要禁。</p>
<p>修養</p>
<h3>煩惱與慾望</h3>
<p>— 華美</p>
<p>萬千年來，芸芸眾生的人類，運用他那得天獨厚超越宇宙的智力，逐步替他們自己創造了一個燦爛奪目的新世界——一個備極文明華麗的近代社會。</p>
<p>但究竟是什麼偉大的工作呢？是孿孿不絕永遠不會從人類的慾望之海中停止生長的種種無窮的慾望所推動完成的！千萬人將要這樣齊心地作唯一的回答。這真是不朽的話！因為沒有慾望，人類便沒進步！可是，歷來整個人類所發覺到最不舒服的「煩惱」（包括戰禍以及一切人為的災禍，同人間的一切由人為而引起的不快樂和不幸在內），卻從這兒應運而生了。換句話說，他們雖因着他們自己的勞力而享到文明的福，同時卻也因此受到相等程度的煩惱，時時糾纏的痛苦哩。</p>
<p>他們為了要滿足自己各個不同的慾望，于是，發生了無數不可避免的利害衝突，種種衝突漸漸地演到白熱化，終于互相爭論，對罵打架。結果，雙方都因為自己美妙的理想，受到意外的阻礙，而發生痛切的不快，煩惱就在這一霎那中隨之發生。以上就是煩惱底由來。</p>
<p>近代頭腦清晰的哲學家基于上述的理論，就開闢了一條新「律」——煩惱與慾望底消長互成正比。</p>
<p>我們如把這條新律用簡單的數學理論加以註釋，便可得到如下的一個結論。</p>
<p>如果慾望可能使它等于零。則煩惱也必等于零。慾望愈趨低　，煩惱也必定隨之減輕到同樣的程度。反之，人類的慾望愈趨高漲，則隨後發生的煩惱決不會因此而遇到不增劇的例外的。</p>
<p>我們二十世紀的人類，生活在這一個文明的世界上，種種的福是亨得夠了，但是，那可恨的煩惱卻依舊隨時隨地來顯它的殘性，時時打痛我們索然無辜的心田，這真是不幸。我們為減少不必要的精神痛苦起見，我們實應自制地把自己無謂的慾望抵制一下，就可把將要發作的煩惱抵消到九宵雲外去了。當不正當和過份的慾望在我們自知的心田中發作時，我們可果敢地這樣作，因為這樣往往便可使自己成為一個快樂和能自制的人！</p>
<p>朋友們！你們羨慕人家的西裝革履嗎？你們羨慕人家的洋樓大廈嗎？你們也羨慕人家的奢侈生活嗎？其實這些並沒有什麼過份值得我們留戀之處，他們正因此而受着不比你們輕的煩惱痛苦地糾纏着呢！</p>
<p>「知足者常樂」，這一句名言當成為我們百年生活上的一個不朽格言！</p>
<p>思想</p>
<h3>祝與福</h3>
<p>— 葉扁舟</p>
<p>俗語雖然有句詁說，「天有不測風雲，人有旦夕禍福」。不過我們能極明顯的理會到：這樣的　　，範圍是極狹隘的，是專指突然發生的一種禍福。決不是人生真真的禍福。所謂人生真真的禍福，那決不能與風雲作同一的比擬，它可以在禍福未來臨前，作一個較準確的預測。而且這準確的預測者，不是旁人，而是自己的本身。但尚有一般頭腦被宿命說所控制的人，有這樣一句自以為至理名言的「處世哲學」，所謂「今生享福前生修，前生作惡今生苦」，那更是懸空八隻腳的騙人的鬼話。</p>
<p>幸福的生活，是人人渴望着的，但假使祗作抽象的渴望，而不踏向幸福的路上去的話，那是永遠等不到幸福的。雖然在這幸福的途徑上，難免有荊棘與刺草，會刺傷你的皮膚，有崎嶇峭壁的山路，會使你乏力，跌交，更有不大容易看得清楚的泥沼，會使你陷下去。但我們對於這一切，都要用鋼鐵般的意志與果敢的精神去克服它；這樣才能得到真真的幸福。所以我敢說：「世上沒有不吃苦而得到的幸福，否則這樣的幸福是可恥的；同時也沒有吃過了千辛萬苦而得不到幸福，除非沒有認清楚真真的幸福究竟是什麼。」</p>
<p>禍呢？也是一樣的。雖然有許多的禍應歸罪於社會，但是社會的本身是什麼呢？也就是我們每個人的意識形態的總合體。也可以說：每個人就是社會裏的一個微小的細胞。假若每個細胞都能起作用的話，那末歸罪於社會的禍，何嘗不能消滅呢！</p>
<p>教育</p>
<h3>貨真價實</h3>
<p>— 君</p>
<p>本市私立中小學校長上次開會議決下學期收費標準之後，教育局認為他們所定的數目太高而打了一個折扣，於是校方又認為教育局所定的數目太低了。結果經雙方會議之下，決定了學費之外，另外增收一筆雜費，幾番的討價還價，最後終於讓校方是滿意了。</p>
<p>校方是滿意了，一般家長卻不免加重了負擔。不過憑良心說一句，增費後，若學校真能把錢化在提高教師待遇和添置教育設備上，我想家長們為了自己的子弟能夠進一個好學校，　不肯咬緊了牙關付出去的。這幾年來，出於老師待遇的　薄，逼得那些夠為人師表的遠走高飛，另謀生路，剩下來的不免有些是胸無點墨，較之學生高明無多的老師，結果真不知誤盡了人家多少子彈。至於教育設備，說來更是可憐，不但樣內的設備　　得不像樣子，連校舍也以鴿籠式者佔據多數，把學生關在裏面，竟然不見天日，更是說不過去。這一次增費之後，希望都能着實的改革一番。</p>
<p>想起商店有一句招徠顧客的話，叫做「貨真價實」。雖然拿學校來比做商店，似乎不大恭敬，其實各校辦理的成績，真能夠得上這四個大字，也就對得住一般學生和家長了。</p>

<h3>關於娼妓</h3>
<p>— 陳錦江</p>
<p>說起「娼妓」，也許立刻會引起許多「君子」們的非難，其實這問題纏綿在中國舊社會裏，已經不知幾百年了，不過一直一現在，還被「君子」們忌諱着掛上口頭。</p>
<p>就像原子一樣，當它散發它積聚着的熱能時，人力就很難加以控制；何況娼妓本身也就是人帬中的份子？更何況娼妓所造成的後果，是人類共鑒的呢？</p>
<p>現在，我們真可慶幸，現在我們也「民主」了；民主的國家裏，人人都得解放；可是街頭賣唱，路邊拉客的娼妓們，偏不知自愛，偏不知民主，偏不自動解放；於是，不得不勤勞了我們的當局，一連串地封閉了按摩院，鄉導社後，終於這一批風化業從業員被「解放」了。（實際上祗不過是極小的一部份而已）其餘的，像畫寓，妓院則飭令即日前往登記。</p>
<p>她們獲得解放了，或者是已登記而認為解放有日的，但是來日方長，她們將怎樣做呢？雖然，以往她們並不一定是這樣的卑鄙，並不一定生來就是妓女，但是到了今日，廉恥剝奪了她們的人生，她們處於今日的社會中，除了賣淫，就會被摒棄在社會其他職業圈以外的，她們解放了，又將怎麼辦呢？</p>
<p>這是一個社會問題，久被「君子」們忌諱着的社會問題！自然現在的結局還不是人民的公僕的時候，當然沒有思前顧後的為這一批被解放的可憐蟲安排下更優良的職業，同時，也沒有計較到她們未來的命運；祗是匆匆忙忙地整飭地方風紀而已！</p>
<p>我們真奇怪，為什麼不把她們送入感化院裏去，好讓她們受一些感化教育呢？難道教育的破產到連「廉」「恥」也無法灌輸給這一帬被遺棄了的人帬嗎？</p>

<h3>女子服飾的象徵</h3>
<p>— 渡雲</p>
<p>記得李笠翁在「閒情偶寄」中提到女子的服飾，有關國運趨向的大通理，說來有憑有據，頗有考證餘地。明末降清的錢離益，還向清主提過十不投的條件，以掩飾其漢奸行為，讓下一代來負起「復明」的責任。所謂「十不投」者，有「老投小不投」，呱呱墜地的嬰兒，仍穿着叉襟衣；「陽投陰不投」，廟宇內的神像，依舊塑着蟒袍；「俗投僧不投」，和尚依舊穿着袈裟，道士還保持明代書生打扮。換一句說「十不投」無非保留着一部分明代衣冠，使國民觸景生情起復國之念，用意亦良苦矣！</p>
<p>服式之於國運，說來不無有些關係，尤其是女子服式，時時變換。在民廿五六年間，女子夏季單旗袍，盛行一種右大襟，看去是東洋人不成？廿六年八一三戰事爆發，上海不久淪陷，女子的服裝，竟成了識象。可是行孫久，在今春有中西合璧式的春裝大衣出現，想不久美軍要到上海了，果然日皇無條件投降，大批盟軍來滬，這服式又成了預徵，怪不怪！而日本旅滬女子，卻有盛穿中國旗袍，預兆其國運之沒落。</p>
<p>還有女子在剪髮後，並未減少其麻煩，卻在頭髮方面，做出種種花樣，「頭髮是女子的榮耀」真是不錯。在先女子盛行燙髮，後來燙成飛機式，那正是徵象空軍得勢，居陸海空戰的第一位。終因電力問題，取締燙髮，於是一般婦女，盛梳額上兩角式，這又是同日本式一般，可是新近又改變了，只梳成獨角式，這象徵什麼呢，或說，女人頭上出角，表示女權膨脹，想不久國大開幕，制定憲法，婦女參政，定有實現希望。</p>
<p>國際</p>
<h3>英國離婚案激增</h3>
<p>— 廷鈞</p>
<p>英國近年來發生了一個很嚴重的社會問題，就是離婚的案件突然激增。其中要求離異的多半是遠征的軍人家族，而提出請求的又多屬男的一方面。</p>
<p>關心社會問題的人，經過細心的研究後，知道這種現象實在具有好多原因。</p>
<p>主要的原因當然是由於軍人們離鄉背井，同妻子分開得太久了。軍人們離家在外，平均總在四十個月至四十八個月，不能請假回家一次，英國有史以來，可以說從沒有這麼多人同時一齊去從軍的，這麼多人，和家庭分隔這麼久，男的旅居在外，女的空幃獨守，大家過着凄涼寂寞的生活，自然容易發生行為不檢的事，釀成離婚的事件。</p>
<p>請求離異的以男子居多數，這並不是說女子比男子不忠貞，這一半也是因為男子的態度有毛病。因為有的男子竟以為：和未婚的女子發生關係，那並不算是通姦。而窮苦的勞工階級，男子的思想陳舊，他們回來後，一看到妻子多認識了幾個男朋友，再和男朋友一塊出去，並肩同走，就以為那是「不規矩」，就鬧得要離婚了。而在勞工階級中，婦女在戰時比較平時容易掙錢，經濟上比較獨立，這也是造成離婚的原因之一。嵵戰時人口移動，婦女多遷移到工業區的都市裏，認識幾個男朋友，再國手頭略微寬裕一點，行為也就不大檢束了。</p>
<p>此外，在戰時結婚太匆忙，選擇不十分審慎，婚後在戰時的生活又是那樣艱苦，這種種也是造成離婚的原因。</p>
<p>現在英國一班社會工作人員已用種種方法，去防止這類家庭的悲劇。在一班離婚的案件中，取消原意，言歸於好的也有，這有的是由於社會福利工作人員的努力，有的是因為孩子使大人的心軟了下來，（這是主要的原因），有的是因為丈夫體諒到妻子空圍獨守那種苦況。</p>

<h3>Reorganization of the Communist Army and Stationing Issues to Reach Preliminary Conclusion Soon; Executive Yuan to be Reorganized According to Resolutions</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Chongqing, 4th] It is understood that regarding the future organization of the military, concerning the combined use of infantry, cavalry, artillery, engineering, transportation, and various types of armored vehicles, military experts have debated the structure. Some advocate for the unification of all arms, while others argue for maintaining the old system of military branches with a reorganized structure, leading to lengthy discussions. It is now learned that military authorities have decided that training for each military branch will temporarily remain as separate units. However, during combat, the various branches will be evenly distributed among the infantry divisions for joint operations. The Military Affairs Commission also specifically gathered cadres from all mechanized units that participated in the war within the Armored Vehicle Training Headquarters a month ago for concentrated training. This group will also be responsible for receiving all enemy tanks surrendered, with the intention of forming the backbone of China's future army.</p>

It is learned that over the past two weeks, Minister Zhang Zhizhong, representative of the Military Affairs Commission, and Mr. Zhou Enlai, representative of the Chinese Communist Party, have held continuous meetings individually with General Marshall, the advisor to the committee. In the past two days, Zhang and Zhou have also directly discussed and exchanged comprehensive opinions on the reorganization and stationing of the Communist army, as well as related technical issues.

Some personnel have suggested that the movements of the Communist army are still noteworthy, with recent indications of a large number of Communist troops moving towards Mentougou, but this remains to be confirmed. A small number of Japanese troops in Zaozhuang, Southern Shandong, and west of Jinan appear to have concentrated in Jinan to surrender.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper, Beiping, 4th] Regardless of whether there are setbacks in the prospect of peace, on New Year's Eve this year, the most conflict-ridden North China did not hear any gunfire. Personnel from the three parties of the Executive Department celebrated the arrival of peace in the Jiuye Mansion in Beiping at 7 PM on New Year's Eve, and after the meeting, amidst the sound of firecrackers everywhere, they issued the seventh joint announcement, stating that "the Executive Department is full of optimism, the cessation of conflict has achieved satisfactory results, and the restoration of transportation is under discussion."

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Farmers' Day for Farmers to Voice Grievances</h3>
<p>Yesterday was Farmers' Day. Minister of Social Affairs Gu Zhenggang made a special broadcast to farmers, expressing his respect and condolences for the great sacrifices and contributions of farmers to the country and the nation. He also hoped that all the people of the country would work hard on three things: (1) Supporting peace and unity to establish a national order; (2) Participating in rural self-government to realize the democracy of rural politics; (3) Reforming the rural economy to realize the democracy of the rural economy. Regarding the first point, Gu said: "After the victory of the War of Resistance, what the country needs is to build peace and unity. What is most likely to hinder our country's construction now is social unrest and national division. The manifestations of social unrest and national division are the disturbances of bandits everywhere and the separatist rule of military forces. Now, if we want to lead the country onto the path of peaceful nation-building, we must break the phenomenon of chaos and separatism that endangers the country. The recent Political Consultative Conference decided on a peaceful nation-building program, among which the most important principles are to follow the Three Principles of the People as the highest guiding principle for nation-building, and to unite all forces in the country under the leadership of Chairman Chiang to build a unified, free, and democratic new China. We hope that the nation's farmers will promote the realization of these principles." We bought Minister Gu's broadcast to the nation's farmers, deeply feeling the government's concern for the welfare of farmers. The establishment of Farmers' Day shows how much the government cares about the farmers. The establishment of Farmers' Day was due to the adoption of a resolution at the National Agricultural and Forestry Administrative Conference on March 22, 1941, to thank farmers for their contributions to the War of Resistance. Yesterday's Farmers' Day was the first holiday after the victory of the War of Resistance. We passed this holiday when spring returned to the earth and the sun shone on the world, and we couldn't help but feel many emotions.</p>
<p>China is mainly a country composed of farmers; farmers are the backbone of China's population. The reason why we were able to achieve victory in the eight-year long War of Resistance, although the reasons were not simple, was mainly due to the contribution of the farmers. Most of China's soldiers come from the countryside; the rural children prevented our source of soldiers from drying up, and ultimately enabled us to successfully complete our great patriotic war. This is well known. Thanks to the hard work of the farmers, we had no worries about food shortages during the arduous long-term war, allowing us to devote ourselves to the war effort. This is also well known. Apart from these two points, there is an even more important point that is not widely known. That is, during our long-term War of Resistance, the reason why our national economy was able to avoid collapse was mainly due to the countryside. China's rural economy supported our eight-year long War of Resistance. In addition to joining the army and farming, Chinese farmers also devoted themselves to other kinds of production. It was thanks to these kinds of production that the War of Resistance was able to be successfully completed. To give an example, under the wartime conditions of the Haikou blockade and transportation difficulties, farmers everywhere worked hard to manufacture local paper, so that newspapers, publishing, and even all cultural activities in the interior would not stop. These contributions to the War of Resistance were really too great. On the first Farmers' Day after the victory of the War of Resistance, we must first express our deep gratitude to our farmers.</p>
<p>However, Chinese farmers silently and indifferently work in their fields, in their villages. They themselves do not understand their contribution to the War of Resistance, nor do they understand our thanks. Everyone is like an unnamed hero, silently and diligently working. They are truly the life of our nation. We say to them, "Thank you for your contributions that made the War of Resistance successful." They do not understand, they do not care. In their simple words and heavy footsteps, they know what kind of life they are living. The elderly, after taking a puff of their pipe and drinking a sip of tea, will let out a sigh and say something like "These days are really hard!" Indeed, when celebrating Farmers' Day, we really should not forget the suffering of Chinese farmers. Only by finding ways to improve their actual lives a little can we live up to the profound meaning of the nation's designation of Farmers' Day.</p>
<p>Today, the suffering of Chinese farmers is too deep. The exploitation by landlords is well known. However, even worse than the exploitation by landlords are the government officials. Since the conversion of land tax to in-kind payment, the cruelty of the grain administration authorities towards farmers has been endless. In the highest authorities of the grain administration, there was originally no intention to make things difficult for farmers, but due to the layers of the grain administration system and the lawlessness of the lower officials, the victims were still the poor and helpless farmers, the farmers whom we want to thank on Farmers' Day. On the first Farmers' Day after the victory, we voice grievances for the farmers. First, we must ask the government to abolish the existing grain administration system and thoroughly investigate the crimes of grain administration officials who acted lawlessly and bullied the farmers and punish them severely.</p>
<p>In addition, the taxes and levies borne by farmers are too cumbersome. Not to mention the land tax, farmers have to pay taxes for carrying a few bamboo poles into the city, and they have to pay taxes for bringing some chickens and ducks into the city. Every move, everything has to be taxed. "Rural idiots" feel that the government's taxes and levies are cumbersome and almost everything is taken from the farmers. This is really an unwise thing for the government. When the National Revolution was carrying out the Northern Expedition, there was a slogan of "abolishing exorbitant taxes and miscellaneous levies." However, the current "exorbitant taxes and miscellaneous levies" are still exorbitant and miscellaneous. "Farmers' Day for farmers to voice grievances," we want to ask the government to abolish the exorbitant taxes and miscellaneous levies imposed on farmers.</p>
<p>The above is presented. Our government is concerned about the welfare of farmers, and we deeply believe that it will be able to implement them one by one. Today, with the national promotion of the call for "industrialization," we are celebrating Farmers' Day at the beginning of the year, which is even more meaningful. Indeed, our future nation-building must move towards "industrialization," but we must not forget that agricultural production is the foundation of the nation. Our future nation-building is planned nation-building, and industry and agriculture must be given equal importance. Within the scope of agriculture, we must never forget that the primary task of the farmers' movement is the people's livelihood, and the basic principle of the people's livelihood is "those who till the land should own it." Now that everyone follows the Three Principles of the People as the highest principle of nation-building, we must ensure that those who till the land "have" their land. As for the improvement of agricultural affairs and the improvement of farmers' lives, we must avoid copying established methods and thinking that what works in foreign countries must also work in China. We must adapt foreign methods to the necessary conditions while taking into account objective facts. Only in this way can farmers truly receive practical benefits.</p>
<h3>Wei Daoming to Negotiate with the US for a Loan of 2 Billion US Dollars for Reconstruction and Industrial Development</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 4th] President Truman has asked Congress to approve the US loan of $3.75 billion to Britain. It is understood that this move may cause other countries to successively request the same loan, and countries may submit requests without waiting for Congress to pass it. It is expected that China will be at the forefront. Chinese Ambassador to the United States Wei Daoming has returned to Chongqing to report on his work, and has returned to his post. It is generally speculated that Ambassador Wei may have received instructions to start negotiating a large loan with the United States. The amount of the loan should be at least 2 billion US dollars. According to Chinese officials, if this loan is approved, it will be used for China's post-war reconstruction and the revitalization of industry and commerce, with emphasis on the modernization of existing industries and the development of other industries. China will try its best to rely on its own strength to seek reconstruction and industrialization, but due to limited financial resources, it will be difficult to bear this heavy burden if it wants to establish a solid foundation in politics, society and industry. Recently, President Truman announced that after the political situation in China stabilizes, the United States will give preferential consideration to the issue of loans to China. The attitude of the United States towards China can be seen from this.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 3rd] Former US Commercial Attaché to Shanghai, Ms. Smith, said in a speech at the New York Export Advertising Club that China is now transitioning from handicraft industry to technical training and scientific research, so as to win a solid position among the major countries in the world. This creates more opportunities for American goods and manufacturing methods. There are currently more than 1,000 Chinese technicians practicing in American industries, and tens of thousands of people are being trained in Chinese schools, all of whom are at the forefront of China's progress. China has a very high level of discernment for the art of advertising, and publications throughout China are also constantly increasing.</p>
<h3>US Aid to Reconstruction: Our Country's Shipbuilding Industry</h3>
<p>[United Press International, Washington, 3rd] According to the Surplus Property Administration's report to Congress on the disposal of surplus shipyards, the United States hopes to sell large quantities of shipbuilding materials to China, Europe, and South American countries to revive their shipbuilding industries. This shipbuilding material includes sixteen fully equipped surplus shipyards and other shipbuilding materials valued at five million US dollars in eight other locations. The report considers the disposal of these shipyards to potentially become a crucial economic issue for the United States.</p>
<p>[United Press International, Hong Kong, 4th] As of now, the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration's Kowloon office has handled a total of fourteen ships, weighing several thousand tons, of relief supplies. These supplies are handed over to the China Relief and Rehabilitation Administration for final distribution throughout China. The office has only six staff members, cooperating with the Hong Kong branch of the China Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, and is responsible for transshipping UNRRA supplies to China. The supplies are first unloaded in Hong Kong and then transported to Guangzhou by rail or other means, where the local branch of the China Relief and Rehabilitation Administration inspects and disposes of them. Recent relief supplies arriving in Hong Kong include freight cars purchased by UNRRA from the US Army and Navy. A batch of train locomotives is also en route, most of which will be shipped to Shanghai. In addition, three more ships are expected to arrive here soon.</p>

<h3>Meningitis Outbreak in Ningdu; Plague Spreads in Nancheng</h3>

<h3>Jiangxi Province Transportation Reconstruction Project to Be Completed by Year-End; Restoration of the Guangdong-Hankou Railway to Take at Least Two Years</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanchang, 4th] The transportation reconstruction work in Jiangxi Province will not be fully completed until the end of this year due to insufficient labor and materials. In particular, bridge projects require more materials due to the thorough destruction, and a suitable supply method has not yet been found. Currently, the Nancheng-to-Linchuan section of the Fujian-Jiangxi Line has been opened to traffic, and the Linchuan-to-Nanchang section will be opened by the end of March. The Ningdu-to-Yingtan section of the Jiangxi-Zhejiang Line is operating normally. The Jiangxi-Hunan Line will soon resume its pre-war route, passing through Niuhang, Wanzai, and reaching Liuyang and Changsha in Hunan Province, connecting with the Sichuan-Hunan Line. However, the construction of various sections of this line within Jiangxi has not yet started and still follows the Jiehua-Long route into Hunan, operating normally. Water transportation is mostly difficult due to low water levels. Although small steamships operated by private individuals run between Xun and Ji'an-Ganzhou, the shallow water and high freight rates cause inconvenience for travelers. The recent surge in rice prices in Nanchang is due to various reasons, but transportation obstacles are also one of them.</p>
<p>[United Press International, Guangzhou, 4th] The slow pace of reconstruction in southeastern China is largely due to the difficulty of repairing the Guangdong-Hankou Railway. The Guangdong-Hankou Railway is 700 *li* long and is the only railway connecting coastal ports with the Chinese interior. According to engineers who have just completed the survey, it will take at least two years to restore the railway to its pre-war condition.</p>

<h3>Japan No Longer Mysterious: The Inside Story Fully Exposed</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Tokyo, 4th] Japan, once the most mysterious country in the world, has now become an "open book" for the Blue Army officers. The US Army Department of Intelligence has collected more than 1,500 kinds of documents about Japan. When the Allied forces landed, technical intelligence personnel first inspected Japanese arsenals. Later, the Army and Navy intelligence groups and scientists also went out to search. The following are some important gains of military intelligence personnel: Japan's attack submarines and aerial torpedoes were invented based on the principle of gliding. However, Japan abandoned the work of aerial torpedoes in 1944 due to the lack of necessary gyroscopes. In 1944, Japan obtained basic plans from Germany for manufacturing rigid carbon aircraft and rocket engine fuel, and immediately set up factories to manufacture them. However, due to the lack of technical personnel and raw materials, and all work records were destroyed when the Allied forces bombed Tokyo, the work was suspended indefinitely. Japanese morale was still very strong at the end of the war, because the Japanese people did not know how the war situation had changed in the late stages of the war. However, due to the lack of unified benefits for the victory goal, it inevitably gradually became a divided situation. Other aspects of Japan, such as political parties, shrines, synthetic rubber, suicide tactics, the black market, broadcasting, and whaling, have all been discovered by US intelligence personnel.</p>
<h3>Egyptian Government and People Firmly Demand: Complete Withdrawal of British Troops; Rift Between King Farouk and British Ambassador Deepens; Egyptian Nationalist Party Opposes British-Egyptian Treaty Negotiations</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 4th] Britain's response to Egypt's note requesting the withdrawal of British troops has delayed the outbreak of political unrest in Egypt, and the conflict of interests between Britain and Egypt is not likely to become sharp soon. When the Egyptian government first made the specific request for the complete withdrawal of British troops, the crisis was expected to occur when British Ambassador to Egypt, Lord Killearn, presented his response. Egypt's political situation will not allow any government to continue to exist or maintain good order for long, unless the government can make strong demands for the withdrawal of British troops. Any government that fails to make efforts in this regard will inevitably be attacked by public opinion and will be difficult to win the favor of King Farouk. It is said that the King instructed the cabinet to make a request for the withdrawal of troops. The 26-year-old King Farouk has become an important figure in Egyptian politics, and his position seems to be above the cabinet. At the same time, the rift between the King and the British ambassador seems to be gradually expanding. It is said that the relationship between the King and the British ambassador has been tense since February 19. Since the King dismissed former Prime Minister Nahas, the relationship between the King and the Wafd Party has been separated. King Farouk is now trying to win the support of the people to fight against the leader of the Wafd Party, who, under pressure from the people, not only hopes to regain power but also advocates deeper social reforms. Therefore, if the King is too stubborn, he will inevitably become his target of attack. If the current Nokrashy government is not satisfactory, the King often tries to avoid endangering his own position. In short, the national ideology in Egypt is already very strong, and public opinion advocates the withdrawal of British troops from Egypt and the merger with Sudan. Although this British reply can delay the crisis for a while, it will eventually be difficult for the Egyptians to be satisfied.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Cairo, 3rd] The leader of the Egyptian Nationalist Party and former Prime Minister Nahas declared today: Any agreement signed by Britain and the current Egyptian government cannot be recognized by the Nationalist Party. Since our country was not invited to participate in the signing of the Italian agreement, it is difficult to make demands for the recovery of lost land, and this matter is even more unacceptable to us. In addition, according to sources who know the situation, another batch of British troops has landed in Alexandria, and it is expected that other troops will continue to arrive in the shortest time.</p>

<h3>Stalin Cables Iranian Prime Minister, Hopes to Enhance Friendship Between the Two Countries, Iran Receives Notification to Prepare for Direct Negotiations</h3>
<p>[United Press Black Hill, 4th] Marshal Stalin cabled the new Iranian Prime Minister Saddan today, hoping that the friendly relations between the Soviet Union and Iran will be enhanced. In his telegram to Prime Minister Saddan, Mr. Stalin said, "I deeply appreciate Your Excellency's friendly sentiments towards the Soviet Union. I hope that during your tenure, the friendly relations between our two countries will be strengthened and promote the happiness of both sides." British Prime Minister Attlee also sent a reply telegram to the new Iranian Prime Minister of Iran.</p>
<p>[Reuters Tehran, 4th] Iranian newspapers today reported that the Soviet government has notified Iranian Prime Minister Saddan that the Soviet government is prepared to receive an Iranian mission to engage in direct negotiations in Moscow regarding the Azerbaijan incident.</p>
<p>[United News Agency London, 3rd] Preliminary negotiations on the Iranian issue have begun in London. Former Iranian Prime Minister Suhaili, who accompanied the Iranian delegation to the UN General Assembly, met with Soviet Chief Representative Vishinsky once, but it was largely just a matter of exchanging pleasantries.</p>
<p>[Reuters London, 4th] "The Observer" commented that the United Nations Security Council has decided to hand over the Iran-Soviet dispute to the countries directly concerned for direct negotiations. The Soviet government should not want these negotiations to fail again. The Soviet Union's needs should be mainly moderate, so as to be acceptable to the majority of the Iranian people. It would be especially appropriate to provide Iran with some of the materials it needs. The Soviet Union's most important need should be the concession of oil exploration rights in northern Iran, followed by the establishment of a Soviet-style regime in Azerbaijan, equivalent to the independence of a province. Because the Soviet Union's Baku oil fields and pipelines are close to the area, Moscow hopes to use Azerbaijan as a barrier. The next most important thing is to reorganize the central government to make it a centralized and more progressive government, preferably similar to the governments of Romania and Bulgaria. Some British people say that the expansion of Soviet influence in northern Iran is a failure of British diplomacy, but this is not the case. Although the Soviet Union has obtained oil exploitation rights in northern Iran and promoted the interests of local and proletariat, Britain can still launch agricultural and social welfare affairs in southern Iran to counter it. Britain's position in the entire Middle East is actually similar to this. Syria, Lebanon, and even Iraq all hope that the British will withdraw. Britain has been in the Middle East for nearly sixty years, but it has indeed lacked significant achievements in social welfare. It is not too late to take remedial measures now.</p>

<h3>Japanese Yasukuni Shrine Changed to Amusement Park</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Tokyo, 3rd United Press] The Yasukuni Shrine, formerly used for propaganda by Japanese warlords, plans to "democratize greatly" today and install amusement park facilities. Priest Ikeda of the shrine said that in view of the sharp decline in tax revenue, the shrine will set up rotating playing machines, ice skating rinks, table tennis rights, and other game facilities in order to maintain its livelihood. The shrine contains the divine souls of 300,000 Japanese war dead, but after the end of the war, the number of incense offerings has become increasingly rare, which is indeed a psychological reflection of the people's defeat. Ikeda went on to explain that this amusement park move is based on the legend of the shrine, which is a place for both gods and people to enjoy themselves.</p>

<h3>Safeguarding Schools and Protecting Teachers, Director Gu of the Bureau of Education Issues a Statement</h3>
<p>[This City News] Recently, after the end of the semester, private schools in the city are experiencing personnel disputes due to the dismissal of teachers or facing criticism from parents due to the announcement of closures, such as Zijiang and Shenjiang schools, which have filed complaints with the city's education authorities. Gu Yuxiu, Director of the Municipal Education Bureau, issued the following statement on this matter: (1) The purpose of running schools is to cultivate talents for the country. Donating money to establish schools is originally a public welfare undertaking for society. Now that victory has arrived, education is a necessary task to be promoted. All levels of schools are only allowed to increase, not decrease. If private schools have financial difficulties, in addition to asking the board of directors for subsidies, they can use legal means to raise funds from all walks of life. If there is still no way, they can request relief from the administrative authorities. They are absolutely not allowed to close down voluntarily, causing children to lose their schooling. (2) Teachers and staff should be protected in accordance with the law. The Ministry of Education has long had clear regulations on this method, and this bureau will naturally follow it. For the sake of improving teaching efficiency, school authorities should not lightly change the originally appointed teachers unless there is sufficient reason, so as to avoid causing disputes. The above two points have been ordered to all private schools in the city to strictly comply with.</p>

<h3>Basketball League Last Night</h3>
<p>Renyu Overcomes Donghua</p>
<p>The basketball league, the two games of A1 and A2 last night, had a lot of appeal, so the ball room was no longer as deserted as it had been in the past few days, and it was obviously lively.</p>
<p>The first game was the Xuebai vs. Xuehong women's game. The two teams are from the same root. The first half of the game was very serious. Xuebai was merciless and took the lead with 29 to 8. In the second half, they naturally gave in a bit. Xuehong stood out and won 45-34.</p>
<p>The second act was the A2 Renyu vs. Donghua. The former is gradually on the right track under the training of Yu Yuzi, and the performance is already on track. Chen Weiyuan and Wang Huaiding are also good. Donghua is too fiery, which is enough to find itself, so Renyu has always been in the lead, and Donghua can only follow. The first half was 33 to 20, and the overall result was 49 to 38, and Renyu reported victory.</p>
<p>The last game was the South China vs. Giant. In addition to Carson, Giant also got the help of American soldier Fan Enstitsson yesterday, and had the ambition to win. South China played quite hard, and had tied the game several times. Finally, due to exhaustion, Giant Kechimi Rosveshtisson and others scored three goals in a row in the last few minutes, and South China was defeated miserably. The first half was 16 to 13, and in the second half, Li Ruixiong of South China missed several layups under the basket and failed to surpass, and the giants had enough stamina, 21 to 29, and South China lost.</p>

<h3>Trial of Japanese War Criminals, Two Different Perspectives</h3>
<p>The U.S. War Criminals Tribunal held its third trial at 10:00 am yesterday at the U.S. Military Tribunal in Tilanqiao Prison, trying 18 Japanese war criminals who killed three U.S. pilots in Hankou. Presiding Officer General Middleton, four colonels as jurors, and plaintiff's defense lawyer Lieutenant Colonel Weiss, defendant's lawyer Lieutenant Colonel Kiggins, and other responsible personnel, all arrived on time. The 18 Japanese war criminals sat in the dock, listening to the U.S. Army captain translator explaining the various debates to them in Japanese. The opinions of the judges were somewhat different at the second hearing on the first day of the month, which led to fierce debates at the second trial. At the third hearing yesterday, after two hours of verbal battle, the opinions of the parties were slightly unified. The main dispute was that everyone had different views on the case, and there were also slight differences in opinions on the disposition of the 18 prisoners of war. General Middleton advocated that "equal treatment" should be given to each war criminal and a "fair trial" should be given to each war criminal. Lieutenant Colonel Weiss explained: "Our hatred for Japanese war criminals has reached its peak today. During the war, the Japanese forcibly imposed charges on U.S. pilots and put them to death with illegal trials. In the trial courts of these pilots, the Japanese did not give them defense lawyers, and they had no opportunity to defend themselves. Therefore, the treatment that the Japanese are receiving today is really a privilege that war criminals could not have dreamed of." The charges against the 18 war criminals still need to be discussed for some time before they can be determined, and the court has scheduled a retrial at 9:00 am on the 11th.</p>

<h3>Anniversary of the Youth Army's Enlistment, Viewing the Brave Army Under Inspection</h3>
<p>—Jie</p>
<p>A year ago, under the call of our wise leader, knowledgeable youths from all over the country rose up and abandoned their pens to join the army. In less than three months, they exceeded the predetermined goal of 100,000. At that time, the Anti-Japanese War was at its most difficult stage. They were determined to sacrifice for the country and were receiving the strictest training in the rear, preparing to fight the enemy to the death. Who knew that the enemy would surrender completely on the day the army set out, which made this "brave army" of the new China fail to fulfill its long-cherished wish.</p>
<p>Yesterday was the anniversary of the "brave army's" enlistment. The 207th Division of the Youth Expeditionary Force held a grand military parade in Zhongzheng Park at the end of North Sichuan Road to commemorate it. Before 1:00 pm, all the officers and soldiers of the division, fully armed and full of energy, were lined up waiting for the inspection. About several thousand citizens came to visit, including farmers who had rushed from Jiangwan.</p>
<p>The military parade ceremony began at 1:20 pm. First, Qian Dajun, Mayor, Wu Shaochu, Chairman of the Committee, He Dekui, Deputy Mayor, Li Jilan, Deputy Commander, Gu Yuxiu, Director of the Education Bureau, and Wang Xiaolai, Chairman of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, accompanied by Liao Yaoxiang, Commander of the New Sixth Army, and Luo Youlun, Commander of the 207th Division of the Youth Army, inspected the week to the sound of military music, and then boarded the parade platform. When the marching column passed by the parade platform, everyone who visited could not help but give warm applause. Indeed, the steps were too neat, and everyone had a healthy physique, everything symbolized the bright future of the new China.</p>
<p>After the inspection, Mayor Qian delivered a training speech, saying, "Last year, on March 20th, the Japanese Zeng followed the Chairman to fly from Chongqing to Kunming, and inspected you once at Beijiaochang. At that time, the Chairman was very concerned about your living and training conditions. As for the Youth Army, it was produced in the autumn of the year before last, when the enemy was frantically attacking. The Chairman felt that the quality of the national revolution was not good enough, and the training was not enough, so he launched 100,000 youths to join the army, and compiled the knowledgeable youths of the whole country into ten divisions. All the equipment and supplies were improved as much as possible, and strict training was given, so that they would become a living force with a quality higher than everything else, to destroy the enemy. In August last year, the Anti-Japanese War was victorious, and I am very happy to meet the soldiers of the 207th Division again today. In the future, under the premise that national construction must first build the army, your responsibilities are heavy, and I deeply hope that every soldier will not live up to the Chairman's earnest teachings, pay attention to the future, strictly abide by discipline, and exercise their physique, so that everyone can become a cadre of the army."</p>
<p>Then, Gu Yuxiu, Director of the Education Bureau, Wang Xiaolai, Chairman of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, Liao Yaoxiang, Commander of the New Sixth Army, Luo Youlun, Commander of the 207th Division, and others gave speeches, with many encouraging words. The ceremony ended at 2:45 pm, but the visiting citizens surrounded the "brave army" and were unwilling to leave. Finally, they temporarily launched a few comrades to perform a set of bayonet techniques, which won the applause of the audience.</p>
<h3>Local City Discovers Meningitis: 23 Patients Already</h3>
<p>Since the beginning of winter in this city, the climate has been warm and the weather has been abnormal, resulting in the successive outbreaks of smallpox and diphtheria. Recently, hospitals have reported that there have been as many as 23 cases of epidemic cerebrospinal meningitis. The Health Bureau is actively promoting prevention work in the hope of controlling the spread. It is hoped that citizens will pay attention to cleanliness, avoid public entertainment venues, wear masks, and regularly use gargling water to wash their throats. Meningitis is mostly contracted through the nose or tonsils in the throat. The disease is most prevalent in spring and winter, and children are easily infected. The incubation period is approximately one to four days. Patients suddenly experience chills and shivering, followed by high fever, headache, vomiting, stiff neck, and red rashes on the body. If the neck of the patient is bent by hand, the knees will automatically flex towards the back. These are all helpful in early clinical diagnosis. If such symptoms occur, the patient should be sent to an infectious disease hospital for treatment for safety.</p>

<h3>Retrial of Yang Xiguang</h3>
<p>People Arriving in Court to Provide Statements</p>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Yang Xiguang, a Shandong native, was formerly the chief of the Culture Section of the Special High Section of the Tongfu Road Police Bureau under the puppet regime, and is suspected of arresting our underground workers. After the victory, someone reported him, and Yang was arrested and transferred to the court. The case has been tried repeatedly. The defendant claimed that he had rescued and released our arrested underground worker, Han Zhennong. Han had a radio station in Shanghai, responsible for air force intelligence liaison work, and continued to operate after his release, providing information. Han's wife, Zhu Qisun, testified to this in court. The court ordered that Han himself, who is in Chongqing, must come to court to testify in person. Han's wife quickly sent a letter urging him to come to Shanghai. Therefore, when Judge Liu Yugui opened the court at 10:30 AM yesterday, Han personally arrived in court and described the details of what happened, saying that he is now the Deputy Captain of the Air Force Supervision Corps. After being arrested in Shanghai in February 1945, he was indeed rescued by Yang Xiguang, and he did indeed provide me with information afterward. The defendant applied for bail, and the court ordered him to submit a petition, pending a decision by the collegiate bench. The case was adjourned for retrial, and the defendant was returned to custody.</p>

<h3>Dyeing and Weaving Industry Association Agrees to Raise Dyeing Prices by 20-30%</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] There are dozens of factories in the dyeing and finishing group of the Dyeing and Weaving Industry Association. The prices for dyeing and finishing for customers have long been set in a public schedule that is jointly observed. The association has also appointed a standing committee to adjust the schedule from time to time and notify members. The "red schedule" (premium rates) has also been determined, reportedly adding 20-30% to the old prices. According to sources in the association, coal prices have been rising recently, and the market prices of dyes are also trending upward. Although De Fu Yanghang (a German trading company) has been allocated some dyes after being cleared by the Enemy and Puppet Property Management Bureau, the amount is extremely small and the prices are also high, which is invisibly contributing to the rise in dyeing prices. The association held a meeting yesterday to discuss requesting De Fu Yanghang to quickly sell the second batch of goods to be allocated at fair prices to prevent dyeing prices from continuing to rise. The following is a summary of the red schedule dyeing prices (from Grade A mercerized Shilin to Grade B light-colored standard cloth, all are based on 12 pounds and 40 yards of cloth per piece. From Grade A mercerized white silk, to handkerchief cloth, 12 pounds and 30 yards of cloth are used as the standard. Yellow-gray rainproof cloth is calculated as 12 pounds and 40 yards. The dyeing price of each two-grade product is calculated at 90% of the original price). Exchange rates are also very strong. Because the exchange rate of Singapore dollars to Hong Kong dollars is higher than the exchange rate of Singapore dollars to national currency, most overseas Chinese are remitting funds from Singapore to Hong Kong, and then converting them into national currency and bringing them back to the country.</p>

<h3>Economic Briefs</h3>
<p>United Press, New York, 4th.  Dingke, Secretary of the American Paper and Pulp Association, announced today that the American paper industry is rapidly increasing production. Based on current production levels, paper and paperboard production this year is expected to be one million tons higher than last year.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Economic Affairs originally planned to establish a Bureau of Commerce, to take over the Trade Commission and the Fuxing Corporation, with Li Gan as the director. However, Li is unwilling to take this position, and the establishment of the Bureau of Commerce has been delayed. The hundreds of staff members of the current Production Bureau and Trade Commission are waiting for the transfer and dare not leave their jobs.</p>
<p>Previous reports that the Singapore authorities have imposed restrictions on imported goods are inconsistent with the facts, because the authorities are only restricting certain special goods, while ordinary goods are not restricted. Moreover, after the restoration of Singapore, in order to restore a prosperous market, there is no reason to restrict the import of ordinary goods. Therefore, there are more people recently purchasing goods in Hong Kong in preparation for shipping them to Singapore.</p>
<p>It has been decided that the right to navigate China's coast will be reserved for domestic operations. In order to facilitate the current commercial transportation between various countries and China, it has been decided that foreign merchant ships that have signed reciprocal treaties with China will be allowed to enter Chinese ports that already have customs and are open to foreign trade. As for foreign merchant ships in Hong Kong wishing to sail to Shanghai, Guangzhou, Fuzhou, Xiamen and other coastal areas, they must also apply to the Chinese Ministry of Communications or the Director of the Guangzhou Office for a permit.</p>

<h3>Guangdong Bank of China Clears Overseas Remittances</h3>
<p>Since the Bank of China resumed business in the Guangdong area, it has been actively clearing overseas remittances.

The bank's daily expenditure reaches 10 million yuan. As for Hong Kong and Nanyang's</p>
<h3>Book Capital Conversion</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] During the occupation period, the capital of various companies was forcibly converted into puppet currency, and many of them increased their capital with puppet currency. How to convert this into legal currency now is quite a problem. A certain agency has sent an inquiry to the Ministry of Economic Affairs, and it is said that a reply has been received with instructions. The measures will be announced soon.</p>

<h3>Talking About Gambling During the New Year</h3>
<p>— Zhu Junyi</p>
<p>The "official" New Year has passed, and now it is the "people's" New Year.</p>
<p>The "official" Gregorian New Year has never been able to find any new atmosphere. All there is: hanging national flags, the official New Year's worship of the various agencies, newspapers publishing special issues, a day off, and nothing else. The "people's" Lunar New Year is very different. As the saying goes, "Firecrackers get rid of the old, and peach charms renew every household." Everyone uses all their energy to spend this few days of the annual holiday. In my hometown of Western Zhejiang, there are two folk sayings to describe the New Year: "Eat until you burst, gamble until you are happy." It can be seen that the two major events listed in the Lunar New Year are only "eating" and "gambling."</p>
<p>In the past few days, everyone has been busy with the work of eating. The Nanhuo stores (stores selling dried and preserved goods) are crowded all day long with people buying New Year goods. However, the weather is not cooperating this year. The climate is very warm. If you prepare too much, you may not be able to enjoy it yourself, so I will put aside "eating" and talk about "gambling."</p>
<p>In the past, during the Lunar New Year, the government usually took an open-eyed and closed-eyed attitude toward gambling among the people and did not interfere. As a result, those who did not gamble much usually joined in the fun during the New Year when there was nothing to do. Those who liked to gamble were even more eager to gamble wildly during this period. The rich naturally wanted to gamble, and the poor had to scrape together some gambling money to try their luck. Adults were gambling, and the children had New Year's money on them, so they squeezed in the middle to join in the hustle and bustle. Not only were families closing their doors tightly, immersed in dominoes and dice, with the sounds of "pi pi pai" and "ca lang lang" coming from the east and west. There were also various gambling stalls on the streets, attracting the lower classes. This was simply a gambling world.</p>
<p>During the enemy and puppet era, there were even gambling dens. At that time, I don't know how many people indulged in them and became bankrupt. Countless bums, transformed from gamblers, were added to the streets out of thin air. I remember that the young owner of a famous tea shop in this city lost a head office and thirteen branches in a gambling den overnight. Such a wild gamble would make the people of even the world-famous gambling country of Australia listen and have to admit defeat and sigh "at least."</p>
<p>Recently, local authorities have implemented the New Life Movement and severely banned gambling. It is said that in Hangzhou, after arresting gamblers, they were fined and paraded around the city with mahjong tables to show the public. This method is quite new and interesting. This Lunar New Year, the police in this city can abolish "slapping hands" and imitate this method, arresting dozens of gamblers for a group parade, which is much more interesting than dropping dragon lanterns.</p>
<p>In short, gambling is never a good thing. To put it in official terms, it "wastes manpower and money" and should be completely banned. However, one point must be paid attention to, that is, the gambling of peddlers and hawkers must be banned, but the gambling of high officials, nobles, and wealthy merchants hiding in foreign houses must be even more banned.</p>

<h3>Worries and Desires</h3>
<p>— Hua Mei</p>
<p>For thousands of years, the human race, using its unique intelligence that surpasses the universe, has gradually created a brilliant and dazzling new world for itself - a modern society that is extremely civilized and gorgeous.</p>
<p>But what great work is it? It is the endless stream of various infinite desires that will never stop growing from the sea of human desires that has pushed it to completion! Millions of people will answer this unanimously. This is truly an immortal statement! Because without desire, humanity would have no progress! However, the most uncomfortable "worries" (including wars and all man-made disasters, as well as all unhappiness and misfortune caused by humans) that the entire human race has ever discovered have arisen from this. In other words, although they enjoy the blessings of civilization because of their own labor, they also suffer from an equal degree of worries and constantly entangled pain.</p>
<p>In order to satisfy their various desires, countless unavoidable conflicts of interest arose. These conflicts gradually evolved to the point of white heat, and eventually they argued with each other, verbally abused each other, and fought. As a result, both sides suffered unexpected obstacles to their beautiful ideals, and experienced acute unhappiness. Worries arose in that instant. The above is the origin of worries.</p>
<p>Based on the above theory, modern clear-headed philosophers have opened up a new "law" - the rise and fall of worries and desires are directly proportional.</p>
<p>If we interpret this new law with simple mathematical theory, we can get the following conclusion.</p>
<p>If desire can be made equal to zero, then worry must also be equal to zero. The lower the desire, the more certain worry will decrease to the same extent. Conversely, the higher the human desire, the resulting worries will certainly not encounter exceptions that do not increase.</p>
<p>We humans of the 20th century, living in this civilized world, enjoy all kinds of blessings, but the hateful worries still show their cruelty anytime and anywhere, constantly hurting our innocent hearts. This is truly unfortunate. In order to reduce unnecessary mental suffering, we should restrain ourselves and resist our unnecessary desires, which can eliminate the worries that are about to erupt. When improper and excessive desires erupt in our self-conscious hearts, we can be bold in doing so, because this can often make us a happy and self-controlled person!</p>
<p>Friends! Do you envy other people's suits and leather shoes? Do you envy other people's foreign buildings and mansions? Do you also envy other people's luxurious lives? In fact, these are not worth our nostalgia too much. They are suffering from worries and pains that are no less than yours because of this!</p>
<p>"Contentment brings happiness," this famous saying should become an immortal motto in our life of a hundred years!</p>

<h3>Congratulations and Blessings</h3>
<p>— Ye Bianzhou</p>
<p>Although there is a proverb that says, "The sky has unpredictable winds and clouds, and people have fortunes and misfortunes from morning till night," we can clearly understand that the scope of such a statement is extremely narrow and refers specifically to a sudden occurrence of fortune or misfortune. It is definitely not the true fortune or misfortune of life. The so-called true fortune or misfortune of life cannot be compared to wind and clouds in the same way. A more accurate prediction can be made before the fortune or misfortune occurs. Moreover, the person making this accurate prediction is not someone else, but oneself. However, there are still some people whose minds are controlled by fatalism, and they have a "philosophy of life" that they believe is the supreme truth, namely, "Enjoying blessings in this life is due to cultivation in the previous life, and suffering in this life is due to doing evil in the previous life," which is even more of a deceptive and empty ghost story.</p>
<p>A happy life is what everyone yearns for, but if you only yearn abstractly without stepping onto the path to happiness, you will never be able to wait for happiness. Although on this path to happiness, there are bound to be thorns and thistles that will prick your skin, and rugged and steep mountain roads that will make you weak and stumble, and there are even muddy swamps that are not easy to see clearly that will make you sink. But we must overcome all of this with an iron will and a courageous spirit; only in this way can we obtain true happiness. Therefore, I dare to say: "There is no happiness in the world that can be obtained without suffering, otherwise such happiness is shameful; at the same time, there is no happiness that cannot be obtained after enduring hardships, unless you have not recognized what true happiness really is."</p>
<p>What about misfortune? It is the same. Although much misfortune should be blamed on society, what is society itself? It is also the sum of the ideological forms of each of us. It can also be said that each person is a small cell in society. If each cell can function, then why can't the misfortunes blamed on society be eliminated!</p>
<p>Education</p>
<h3>Authentic Goods, Fair Price</h3>
<p>— 君</p>
<p>Following the last meeting where private primary and secondary school principals in the city decided on the tuition standards for the upcoming semester, the Bureau of Education felt the figures they set were too high and reduced them. Consequently, the schools then felt the numbers set by the Bureau of Education were too low. After several meetings between the two parties, it was decided that, in addition to tuition, a miscellaneous fee would be added. After much haggling, the schools were finally satisfied.</p>
<p>While the schools were satisfied, the general parents inevitably had a heavier burden. However, in all honesty, if the schools can truly use the increased fees to improve teacher salaries and purchase educational equipment, I believe parents would grit their teeth and pay up for their children to attend a good school. In recent years, due to the meager salaries of teachers, those qualified to be teachers have been forced to seek other livelihoods, leaving behind some who are ignorant and not much more knowledgeable than the students themselves, resulting in a waste of countless people's precious time. As for educational equipment, it is even more pitiful. Not only is the equipment within the school shabby and in disrepair, but many school buildings are like pigeon cages, trapping students inside without seeing the light of day, which is unacceptable. I hope that after this fee increase, there will be substantial reforms.</p>
<p>It reminds me of a phrase used by shops to attract customers: "Authentic goods, fair price." Although comparing schools to shops may seem disrespectful, if the performance of each school can truly live up to these four words, then they will have justified themselves to the students and parents.</p>

<h3>Concerning Prostitutes</h3>
<p>— 陳錦江</p>
<p>Speaking of "prostitutes" may immediately provoke disapproval from many "gentlemen," but this problem has lingered in Chinese society for hundreds of years. Yet, even now, "gentlemen" are still reluctant to even mention it.</p>
<p>Like an atom releasing its accumulated heat energy, it is difficult for human power to control. Moreover, aren't prostitutes themselves members of society? And aren't the consequences caused by prostitution universally acknowledged?</p>
<p>Now, we can truly rejoice, for we are now "democratic." In a democratic country, everyone must be liberated. However, prostitutes singing on the streets and soliciting customers on the roadside do not know how to value themselves, do not understand democracy, and do not liberate themselves automatically. Therefore, it was necessary for our diligent authorities to close down massage parlors and escort agencies one after another, finally "liberating" this group of professionals in the industry of morality. (In reality, this is only a very small portion.) As for the rest, such as brothels and establishments for prostitution, they are ordered to register immediately.</p>
<p>They have been liberated, or they have registered and believe liberation is on its way, but the future is long. What will they do? Although they were not necessarily so base in the past, and were not necessarily born as prostitutes, today, moral integrity has been stripped from their lives. In today's society, if they don't sell their bodies, they will be excluded from other occupational circles. Now that they are liberated, what will they do?</p>
<p>This is a social problem, a social problem that has long been avoided by "gentlemen"! Naturally, since it is not yet the time of public servants of the people, there has been no forward-thinking arrangement of better occupations for this group of liberated wretches, nor has their future fate been considered. They are simply hastily rectifying local morality!</p>
<p>We truly wonder, why not send them to reformatories to receive some moral education? Has education failed to such an extent that even "integrity" and "shame" cannot be instilled in this group of abandoned people?</p>

<h3>The Symbolism of Women's Clothing</h3>
<p>— 渡雲</p>
<p>I recall that Li Yu, in "Idle Thoughts," mentioned that women's clothing is related to the overall trend of national fortune, with a logical basis and room for verification. Qian Qianyi, who surrendered to the Qing Dynasty at the end of the Ming Dynasty, even presented the Qing emperor with ten conditions of non-submission to conceal his traitorous behavior and let the next generation bear the responsibility of "restoring the Ming." The so-called "ten non-submissions" included "Old submits, young does not," meaning that infants still wore crossover robes; "Yang submits, Yin does not," meaning that the statues in temples were still sculpted wearing dragon robes; "Secular submits, monks do not," meaning that monks still wore kasayas and Taoists still maintained the attire of Ming Dynasty scholars. In other words, the "ten non-submissions" were nothing more than preserving a part of Ming Dynasty attire to evoke the people's feelings and thoughts of restoring the country, which was a well-intentioned effort!</p>
<p>The style of clothing is indeed somewhat related to national fortune, especially women's clothing, which changes constantly. Around 1936 and 1937, single cheongsams with a large right-side placket were popular in the summer, making one wonder if they were Japanese. In 1937, the August 13th Incident broke out, and Shanghai soon fell. Women's clothing became a symbol. After a long time, a combined Chinese-Western style spring coat appeared this spring, suggesting that the American army would soon arrive in Shanghai. Sure enough, the Japanese Emperor surrendered unconditionally, and a large number of Allied troops came to Shanghai. This style became a forecast again. Isn't it strange! Meanwhile, Japanese women in Shanghai were wearing Chinese cheongsams, foreshadowing the decline of their country's fortune.</p>
<p>Furthermore, after women cut their hair, they did not reduce the trouble, but rather made various styles with their hair. "Hair is a woman's glory" is indeed true. Initially, women favored perms, and later they were styled into "airplane" shapes, which symbolized the rise of the air force, ranking first among the land, sea, and air forces. Due to electricity problems, perms were banned, so women generally combed their hair into two horn-like styles on their foreheads, which was similar to the Japanese style. However, recently they have changed it again, combing it into a single horn style. What does this symbolize? Some say that horns on a woman's head indicate the expansion of women's rights. Perhaps the upcoming National Assembly will open, drafting a constitution, and women's participation in politics will hopefully be realized.</p>

<h3>Surge in Divorce Cases in Britain</h3>
<p>— 廷鈞</p>
<p>In recent years, Britain has been facing a very serious social problem, namely the sudden surge in divorce cases. Most of those seeking divorce are families of soldiers who have been sent abroad, and most of the requests are made by the men.</p>
<p>People concerned about social issues have carefully studied and realized that this phenomenon has many causes.</p>
<p>The main reason is, of course, that soldiers have been separated from their wives for too long. Soldiers are away from home for an average of forty to forty-eight months, without being able to take leave to return home once. It can be said that never in British history have so many people been in the military at the same time, and so many people have been separated from their families for so long. Men live abroad, and women live alone in empty rooms, everyone leading a desolate and lonely life, which naturally leads to misconduct and divorce.</p>
<p>Men are the majority of those requesting divorce, which is not to say that women are less loyal than men. This is partly because men have flawed attitudes. Because some men even think that having a relationship with an unmarried woman does not count as adultery. Among the poor working class, men have outdated ideas. When they come back and see that their wives have met a few boyfriends, and then go out with their boyfriends, walking side by side, they think it is "improper" and want to get a divorce. Among the working class, women earn more money during wartime than usual, and are more economically independent, which is also one of the reasons for divorce. During the wartime population movement, women often moved to industrial cities, met a few boyfriends, and when they had a little more money in hand, their behavior became less restrained.</p>
<p>In addition, marriages were too hasty during wartime, the selection was not very careful, and life after marriage during wartime was so difficult, all of which contributed to divorce.</p>
<p>Now, a group of social workers in Britain are using various methods to prevent such family tragedies. Among a group of divorce cases, some cancel their original intentions and reconcile, which is due to the efforts of social welfare workers, or because children soften the hearts of adults (which is the main reason), or because husbands understand the suffering of their wives living alone in empty rooms.</p>
