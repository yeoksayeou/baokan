<h3>首都籌備慶祝　三十六年元旦</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿四日電〕，首都各界爲擴大慶祝三十六年元旦大會，籌備處定廿五日上午十時召開籌備會，商討一切籌備事宜。</p>
<h3>公務員生活補助費　政院擬調整標準　本月內可呈送核定施行</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京二十四日電〕公敎人員生活補助費，行政院決定自十二月份起調整，祇以近月來谷地物價續有變動，該院以補助費標準核定後，變更不易，爲特別審愼起見，故正詳細參酌各地最近物價情形，妥擬標準中，但至遲本月內可呈送核定施行。</p>
<h3>憲草二讀已終了　官吏仍得當選國大代表　十九次大會中秩序紛亂</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿四日電〕國大第十九次會議，二十四日下午三時半舉行，開會時出席代表一一八五人，後續增至一四一二人，由王雲五主席，報吿員宣讀十八次會議紀錄後，繼續二讀工作，自第十四章「憲法之施行及修改」，開始第「一四六」「一四七」「一四八」等三條，均無異議通過。第「一四九」條「憲法之解釋，由司法院爲之」，有倪弼等三十六人提修正案，改爲「憲法之解釋，由立法，司法，監察三院合組憲法解釋委員會爲之，以司法院院長爲主席」。倪說明理由後，王子蘭表示反對謂，美國之憲法解釋權，即屬司法機關，從未發生何種錯誤，主張維持原案，經表決，修正案獲二七一票，而以九〇九票佔多數，仍維持原案。第「五五〇」條對憲法之修改程序，有二修正案，（一）顧毓琇等一六四人提議，將該條第一項原文改爲「由國大代表總額五分一之提議，三分二（原爲四分三）之出席，及出席代表四分三（原爲三分二）之決議，得修改之」，以與國大組織法第十二條制憲之合法人數相符，以可適應環境需要，使修改憲法之限制不致過嚴，經表決，以一〇六二票通過顧等修正案。（二）粟直等三十人提請將該條第二項立院「擬定憲法修正草案」之「正」字，改爲「改」字，經表決獲四八九票，而以一〇二五票仍維持原文。第「一五一」條「本憲法規定事項、有另定實施程序之必要，而以法律定之」，共有兩有關修正案：（一）宣孝等四十四人，提請仍維持第二　委會之審查結果，加列第一五二條，「制定憲法之國民大會，負監督並促成憲法施行之實，其代表之任期，至依照本憲法產生之團民大會集會之日終止」，修正意見讀出後，王主席謂，此項意見已經綜合審委會決議併入過渡條文，加列似無必要，並請該會召集人陳誠說明，會衆則紛紛要求即行表決，王氏高呼，此條關係重要，應有說明，乃於陳氏說明後，應段劍岷等之要求，付諸表決，結果六四六票少數，在場「反表決」之聲，隨之四起，秩序宣吿紊亂。王主席大聲稱：會衆提議反表決，須有五十人以上之附議，一時臂林密排，當即進行反表決，並先由書副秘書長釋明反表決非之性質，奈雷氏官話不靈，一部代表復高吼：一聽不淸，你說的甚麼？」「換秘書長！」等等，會塲爲之鼎沸，反表決之結果，修正案仍被否決。（二）顧毓琇等八十一人提請於第一五一條加列一項，「本憲法施行準備程序，由制定憲法之國民大會議定之」，以爲過渡條款，「憲法施行之準備程　　序」之法律根　。由顧氏略作說明後，即付表決，獲一二一七〇票之絕對多數順利通過，該案原文亦經無異誃通過，至此，　草條文已全部讀過，開始數覆議案之討論，首先提出者，爲對客廿八條二讀會所加之第三項「現任官吏不得當選爲國民大會代表」之兩複議案；（一）胡適等八〇九人提請將該項修改爲「現任官吏不得於任所所在地之選舉區，當選爲國民大會代表」（二）延國符等提請將該條刪除不必明列憲法中。兩修正案宣讀後，噓噓之聲大作，連署人陳　　稱；該項之規定將官吏之被　舉權剝奪，實違反普選原則，並有犧牲人才之嫌，故主張覆議修正。陳氏於噓聲中歸座後，胡庶華復於「瞎說」胡扯入道」之聲中發表贊成修正之理論，然終以秩序混亂，衆皆不知所云。</p>
<p>旋任卓宣發言，反對修正，認爲該項規定極其合理，並申述理由五點：（一）該項規定國大代表之消極資格，官吏如欲當選爲代表，儘可先辭去官職，（二）文官制度確立後，事務官下應競選政務官，公務繁要，亦應全力執行政策不當競選爲代表，（三）國大主要任務之一爲選舉總統副總統，如由官吏任代表從事選舉，必以各人做官爲目標，作選擇。另一爲罷免總統　統，試問屬下如何罷免長官，（四）官吏而兼國民代表，兼黨政治兩權，違反國父權能劃分之原則。民主係有事大家做，做官者旣食俸祿，復搶兼代表，乃少數人專欋漁利，不得謂爲民主。渠並强調：「官官相護」，官吏易地競選，並不影響其權勢之運用，反更勞民傷財，結果眞正能代表人民者，不能選出，國民大會將變爲「官吏大會」。</p>
<p>楊度普繼起發言稱：「官是官，民是民，應予劃分」，並舉參政會中參政員不得兼任官吏之例證與西洋各國之成規，呼籲會衆，鄭衆考慮，維持原決議。某數代表更以議事規則中無對二讀決議事項進行覆議之規定，反對修正案成立。王主席當答稱：議事規則中所無者，依民權初步之規定今覆議已有過半數代表之連署，自得提出，如可獲三分之二之通過，亦得成立，乃於延國符說明其主張刪除該條之提案後，付諸表決，結果刪除案以六二九少數否決。胡適等之修正案以九二一票通過。（在場人數一三〇三人）官更仍得當選爲國大代表。</p>
<p>下午五時休息十五分鐘後，纖續討論覆議案，馬續常，陳紹平等所提於第「四一」「五九」六三」等三條中恢復「大赦」之規定，以七四五票通過修正案。包明叔等所提於第「一六〇」條加「新聞」兩字，請保障新聞記者生活之規定，仍以五四三票之少數遭否決。張之江等臨時所提於第「一五三」條（原第「一四三」條）中，加入「體育」兩字</p>
<p>至下午五時三十五分，開始討論「憲法實施之準備程序草案」，由報吿員宣讀全文，並經孫科說明後，有代表提出問題訂正第二及第八兩條之兩處印刷錯誤，並認爲各條中「依（本）憲法產生之首屆國民大會」，句中」首屆」兩字欠妥，主張一律刪除。趙子懋主張刪除第八條，認爲國大代表立監委產生總額三分二時，即可集會或召集有剝奪其餘三分一之權力之娥，陳煥章等復主張此程序第二條規定之各種立法，應訂明由國民大會授權國民政府爲之，第九條喜政實施促進委員會之職權，亦應訂明原則交國民政府制法規定。時爲下午六時正，經王主席徵得會衆同意，延長十分鏡後，開始表決，除各條國民大會上「首屆」兩字，以九〇二票決議一律刪除外，全部依草案原文無異議通過，六時另五分，王主席宣吿二讀會終了，雷副秘書長報吿廿五日長續開會後散會。</p>

<h3>蘇限令美艦離大連事　引起美重大反響　認爲違反中蘇條約精神</h3>
<p>民主黨參議員司徒華主應予澈究</p>
<p>〔中央社紐約廿三日電〕蘇聯於十二月廿日在大連驅逐美軍艦一節，今日已成紐約之最重要國際新聞，各下午報均以第一版　幅刊載，各報聯合特派員　敦自大連發表之消息，自由主義之紐約郵報標題稱；「蘇聯已將美艦自中國　逐」，赫斯特系報標題稱：「蘇對美艦之最後通縣，限美艦二十分鐘內離開大連」，保守性之紐約太陽報標題稱：「大連蘇軍　逐美艦」。霍華德系世界電訊報標題稱：「蘇軍竟令美軍艦退出大連」。並註稱：　敦爲霍華德系報駐華記者，該文稱：「蘇軍在大連之高　不法行動，實爲對於亞洲和平之威脅，中國原被承認在大連具有主　，然自蘇軍暹進入後，立即控制該城，並自此以後，刖拒絕將其　還中國，蘇軍在此建立爲政，並控制當地之　察，蘇聯以　幕對世界遮掩，此等情形，吾等已慣聞，共產黨人及美國來此之旅行人士所發表之吊襪帶囂言諭，認爲美國在中國駐有大量之陸海軍，並高聲疾呼，指賣其威脅世界之一般和平，尤其蘇美關係；但此等莫斯科之「第五縱隊」，從未　及蘇在大連之高壓及不法行動，吾等在中國之任何城市中，從未侵犯由國之主權，且凡有吾國軍隊駐紥之任何城市，亦從不拒絕蘇聯公民有進入之權利。吾國在蕪僅有小量軍隊，且對中國主權充份承認，而穌對大連之控制則與此等情形完全相反，此實極端違反　蘇友好條約之精神。然則眞正威脅東方和平者究爲美國乎？抑爲蘇聯乎？」</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓廿四日電〕民主黨參議員司徒華，今日主張澈　蘇聯　當局以口頭通吿限令美海軍非武裝船隻於二十分鐘內離開大連，謂此事應當澈究。不知國務院與海軍部對之將作何語，予甚注意。國務院則方靜待大連美總領事彭寗霍夫之正式報吿，力持沉默。據發言人稱：如日內尙無報吿，將令其趕速提出云。</p>
<h3>司使將晤葉劍英　今出席燕大校友歡迎會</h3>
<p>〔本報北平廿四日電〕司徒雷登大使爲何北來，仍屬一謎。一般觀察，可能係觀察北方情勢，藉作調處參考。燕大傳出消息：司使今日上午將訪軍調部三委員，但協和醫院今日並無大使踪跡。傅涇波謂：今日司使整日未外出，但燕大方面消息則謂預定下午四時舉行之燭光禮拜，使良久始至。葉劍英昨曾接洽會晤時間，聞可能在明後日。昨忽由保返平之孫連仲，昨晚曾應吉倫將軍宴，李宗仁亦同被邀請，傳司使亦有在座可能，但未證實。今日上午，孫連仲曾訪傅涇波，蛛絲馬跡，可證司使北來並不單純。明日司使將出席燕大校友歡迎會，司使對其燕園桃李之聖誕禮物，大米四百斤，猪肉四百斤。此間頗傳司使將取消邪惡六日天津之行而逕回南京，但今晚傅涇波未證實此消息，並謂，司使此去係因中美商約頒佈後有衆多事項須聽取北方美商民之意見。</p>
<h3>司使聖誔感言</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京廿四日電〕美國駐華大使司徒雷登博士，赴平度聖誕節前，昨在中央日報發表聖誕感言，茲誌全文如下：</p>
<p>耶穌基督究竟誕生在那一天，恐怕是永遠無從確定的了。最早期的敎堂，僅憑那虔誠的直覺，而亳不猶疑地選定了羅馬的冬至節，來慶祝這最富意義的史蹟。因爲在冬至之前，白書逐漸縮短，而黑夜却逐漸變長，一到冬至，情形就相反了，普照的時間，與日俱增，這就是春到人間，大地轉爲翠綠的先聲。假定耶穌降生此日，或可解釋爲給當時衰微的羅馬帶來了精神上的鼓舞和希望，當耶穌降生的喜訊，在歐洲北部的野聲部落中，他們也自然地跟着傳下了每當聖誕集體圍守着常綠樹的習俗。他們所以如此，無非眼見白畫不斷縮短，惟恐太陽或將完全消失於漫漫長夜中，因而願意陪着太陽，在嚴寒下，同歸於盡，所以他們便緊握着他們所知道的這唯一希望的象徵——常綠樹，並且用那種新發現的信心，和喜悅的表現，來襯托他，就這樣一千多年以來，聖誕節的習俗，便在世界各民族中，錦上添花，洋洋可觀。這些古代民間栩栩如生的傳統風俗，和近代我們用來慶祝聖誕的一切美麗的點綴，對於隱藏在這些東面下的心靈上的信誠，是有着着大的意義的。</p>
<p>「大地平安喜悅歸於人類」，這是一句今日在耶穌世界中家喻戶曉的名言，但是常猶太被羅馬統制，備受帝國主義專制壓迫的時候，一個被征服國家，正瀰漫着反抗的氣燄情形下，這句名言對於他們似乎尙無應騐的希望，從那時以後，在人類歷史上，幾經瞻望人類的前途，然而總好像黯淡無光，不見天色。時至今日，我們又逢一九四八年的聖誕良辰，而世界大局似乎依然一成未變，不過我們假若用歷史的眼光，來看這個世界，我們不難知道，自從那時之後，世界已經長足進步了。我們懷着這個節目所激一起的希總，便能夠恬靜地，阻壯地展望到一種更廣泛，更永久的和平，並且希望藉着文化的交流，以及其他謀取國際間了解的方法，以獲得人間與日俱增的「喜悅」。這種「喜悅」，’當寄託在全世界各國無數人更崇高的理想，和更神聖的目的上，他們團結一致，毅然決然，努力建造更完善的世界。當我們在聖誕的精神中，將自己獻給這種神聖的工作時，無疑地，我們也就能換得新年的快樂。</p>

<h3>聖誕前夕　田樞機告全國教友書　勉爲社會表率筣興固有美德</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕敎廷樞機北平總主敎田耕莘。頃於聖誕前夕，發表吿全國敎友書，全文如下：</p>
<p>親愛的敎友們：</p>
<p>今年六月當本人由羅馬回來，在南京的時候，曾以中國首任樞機的名義，向你們有過廣播；如今又到了吾主聖誕的前夕。這個佳節的來臨，帶予人類以歡欣，帶予人類以和平。今天當聖誕的前夕，對於過去一年來的種種恩寵，我們首先要向全能的天主表示我們衷誠的感謝。</p>
<p>過去的一年，在我國的敎會歷史上，乃至整個民族歷史上是很重要的一年。在道一年內，我們看見有首任國範樞機的任命，公敎會在華敎會體制的建立，二十個省首席總主敎區的劃定和首任省首席總主敎的任命，駐華宗座代表公署的裁撤，首任駐華敎廷公使的任命和敎廷公使館的設置，凡此都是意義極深長的舉措，不特在我們中國的敎會史及民族史上是劃期的；就是在整個人類的歷史，世界史上也是劃期的，我們感謝我們的聖父對於中國教會的關心；由於這些舉措，使中國的天主敎會　入了成年的境域.親愛的敎友們，正惟其有這些舉措，也加重了我們每個敎友的責任。</p>
<p>天主教會是聖而且公的敎會。夭主敎會在我們中國之所以有像今日的境地，端賴過去各修會以及不入會的中外傳敎士的不斷努力。他們的血汗灌溉了我們這一塊天主的葡萄園地。在敎會體制已經在我們中國建立了的今日，我們不但應該銘記他們在過去的功勳，並且更應該情同手足携　合作來謀我國敎務的推進。宗敎原無國界；救人靈魂的事業，本也沒有國籍之分。在宗敎的領域內，我們不能容許有狹隘的民族主義；我們應該積極發揮聖敎會聖而且公的精神。　親愛的敎友們，在敎宗的昭吿裏，我們看見聖父對我們說：天主激會的威脅不是外來的，而是內在的。我們如今看見有聖敎會在華敎會體制的建立，允須愼防威脅的來襲；我們必須保衛我們的信仰。我們必須團結，中外籍的敎士固應打成一片，就是教士與敎友之間，亦應聲氣相通，在神長的督導下，參加信仰的傳揚。在「敎友的敎會工作」（Non　abbiamo　bisongno）這個通諭裏，故敎宗庇護十一曾就敎友們的參加公敎傳信事宜，有所指示。因此，這是每一個敎友的責任，在與神長們的合作下，在當地主敎的督導下來推廣我們的聖敎，使尙未得見眞理的人，也能得見光明。這在我們的中國，尤爲重要。今日我們公敎信衆在全國的人口中僅占着一個極小數，如何使我們的聖敎推廣到更多的人中，這責任不僅落在敎士身上，同時也落在每個敎友身上。每個敎友應該個個是否主耶穌的勇卒，各就其崗位，來防衛並傳揚我們的聖教。</p>
<p>然而當我們想到每一個敎友應盡的責任的時候，對於當前的若干趨勢，我們不能不有所指陳。吾主耶穌的敎會是建立在宗徒聖伯多祿的寳座上的；而伯多祿却就是磐石。天主敎會在中國過去的努力，秉聖敎會光榮的傳統，亦是建築在穩固的基礎上的；我們不能動搖這個基礎。我們的一切努力是爲「天主之國」（Civitas　Dei）的努力；因此，每個敎友不但要有虔誠的信德，而且更應該將他們的信德，表現在他們的行爲上，表現在他們的日常生活上，使我們的信仰與我們的生活行爲打成一片而成爲一種活的信仰。在目今道德窳敗綱紀失墜的社會，我們公敎信衆允應爲社會的表率，以轉移社會的風氣。我們歷代相傳的敦厚　實的風氣，決不能容許爲外來的浮蠶之氣所侵做。侮一個敎友　該銘記在他的心裏他受洗時　所含的臘，我們不能容許有厲　的震來。</p>
<p>這長爲此，親愛的敎友們，我們在當今的時會，負有更重大的使命。我們的元首蔣主席，早在抗戰以前就見到重建道德秩序的重要，亟謀復與我國國有的美德，以建立一般國民的新生活。在建國之精神建設的努力上，我們更應該擔負起我們所應盡的責任。我們要將我們　於宗敎信仰的生活，在目今社會失序的時候，樹立起示範的作用。民族復興，庶其有豸。</p>
<p>末了，本人要於此請我們全國的教友們爲我們的聖父及我國的地首元祈禱。天主保佑我們在中國的聖教會，使我們能有今天。願全能的天主，在我們今後崎嶇的道路上，能够光照我們，像在過去一樣；使因聖誕佳節的來臨，能夠使更大多數的人，得到真正和平和快樂。</p>

<h3>社論　護國與制憲</h3>
<p>—紀念雲南起義</p>
<p>今天爲雲南起義紀念日，國民大會三讀通過了憲法草案之後，也於今天上午在京圓滿閉幕，全國人民多年來日夜所渴望的一部民主憲法，終於制成了。再回想三十一年前的今天，蔡松坡將軍在雲南起義，首先宣佈獨立了，終於推翻了袁世凱的帝制，而巷中華民國重行奠定了一個鞏固的始基。這一段光榮的歷史，雖已時隔三十一年，但是國人至今印象猶新，歷歷如在眼前，所以國民大會在完成其制憲工作之後，於今天圓滿閉幕，實有非常重大的意義。</p>
<p>我國數千年來，一直是個專制的帝國，到了近百年來，人民始逐漸覺醒，而迫切要求政治的民主化。辛亥革命的成功，雖已達到了初步的目標，但是袁世凱做了大總統，心又有所未足，非要做專制的皇帝不可，因此引起蔡松坡將軍在雲南起義護國。卒將帝制推翻，恢復共和。中華民國的政治，原可望走上新生的坦途，無如軍閥割據政客播弄，引起了國內多年的混戰；及至國民革命北伐成功，統一中國的局而粗定，國民政府乃依照國父的遺敎，由軍政時期而步入訓政時期，然後再欲自訓政時期步人憲政時期；在訓政正要結束的時候，七七事變忽又發生了；經過八年的艱苦抗戰，終算打倒了敵人，重奠中華民國的國甚。</p>
<p>從敵人屈膝投降之日起，全國的人民就發出「政治民主化」的呼聲；同時執政的國民黨也早就想還政與民，使中國的政治早日走上民主法治的正軌，又因國共問題的遲遲不能解決，致使國民大會一再延期舉行，其所負有的制憲工作，也無法進行。直到了十一月十五日國民大會始能在南京開幕。到今天閉幕，完成制憲工作，歷時一月又十天，這中國近代史上最重要的一頁。</p>
<p>在這四十五天之內，國民大會從事制憲工作，雖然也發生爭吵和晞噓不遵守會場秩序的事情，但這是任何國家議會所不可避免的現象，正足以表現出民主自由的精神。在各小組分別審議憲法草案的時候，各代表的意見雖不免龐雜，提出種種的修正案，但是到了綜合小組，應難的意見就能消滅於無形，使全體大會所通過的憲法草案，和政府所提出的原案，並沒有加以根本的修正。而政府所提出的原案，是根據政協決議再經黨派會議所決定的，現又經國民大會通過，足見這部新憲法，是全國人民意志的結晶，將來實施，必能事半功倍。</p>
<p>我們對於憲法政制，向來認爲：民主不可移殖，制度不可抄襲；而且又認爲，憲法政制沒有絕對的優劣，有利必有弊。但求其切實可行。所以我們對於國民大會所通過的憲法，是認爲可以滿意的；今後的問題，不在憲法的本身，而在如何行憲了。回頭看看國外的大環境，因爲四國外長會議與聯合國大會的相繼圓滿閉幕，使一九四六年獲得一個平靜的歸趨，而替一九四七年的世界，展開一幕美妙的遠景；因此使我們對於國內政局，也發生無限的新希望：中華民國新憲法定於明年元旦公佈，政府也將在國民大會閉幕之後實行改組，將擴大政府基　，羅致各黨各派曁社會豎達一致參加在內；同時和談也有重開的希望，從此政局開朗，並非不可能的事。所以我們在今天雲南起義的紀念日，得先烈護國的感召，瞻望中華民國的前途，益加增强了我們不可動搖的信心。</p>
<h3>亞洲學生會議</h3>
<p>坦克車結束了第一次世界大戰，原子彈結束了第二次世界大戰，此後只有一個世界，否則便是世界毀滅。原子彈時代的世界各國，其密切稅度，正如一個森林的樹木，一樹失火，樹樹延燒，除非有整個森林的消防計劃，不足以圖安全。人類現應覺悟了，休把人類努力的文明化爲砲灰。原子彈已炸毀大地，更要炸毀人類的偏見與自私。各國不能再以自已國家的私欲爲最高道德，而求一個體系的繁榮。</p>
<p>戰爭是勝利了，和平僅翻開第一頁，我們看各種國際會議，昨日盟友，今日已成對敵，勝利的狂歡不該趕走血的痛苦。我們不要把戰爭的勝利看做努力的結束，而應該把它認爲努力的開始，民族必須平等，政治必須民主，世界必須和平，這是滾浪　來的，世界潮流，沛然無法抵禦。亞洲多弱小民族，企求平等，民主與和平更甚於他處。最近印度學生發起「亞洲學生預備會議」，看他們的宣言或許即爲此故，他們英文宣電中頂扼要的話是：『我們所有的科學·藝術·文化是世界之光，我們領導世界創造一個社會，一個國家，一個人類，生存在我們自己意要中生活着」。</p>
<p>全印學生會十二月十五日在孟買發出通吿，要求亞洲各國學生選派代表於十二月卅日的第一屆亞洲學生預備會議，地點在旁遮普的省會臘河爾，擬組織亞洲學生會，被邀的國家有中·國·伊拉克·伊朗·阿富汗·泥泊爾·不丹·緬甸·爪哇·印度尼西亞和越南諸國。我國已選定北京·中央·中山·四川·復旦和金女六個大學代表，幷派帶隊一人，即日搭機飛昆轉印。</p>
<p>這件事與印度召開的泛亞洲會議一樣的驟然而來，與世界靑年民主協會似無關係，但有綫索可尋，該協會由英國發起於一九四六年夏在巴黎開會，開會時印度學生代表已露出有亞洲國際學生會議的意思，這次學生會議不論是爲印或爲弱小民族或爲全世界，我們不能袖手旁觀。爲印度，即爲弱小民族，亦即爲全世界爲弱小民族，即爲印度，亦即爲全世界。道三個問題實是一個問題？至少這三個問題具有密切的連環性。今日世界潮流，民族必須獨立，政治必須民主，國際必須和平。印度已苦個了二百年，苦鬥了二百年，現在時機已熟，英國工黨內　上臺時，艾總禮首相宣言：『工黨政府深信民族自治原則，自當設法援助印度四百　人民解決其創設自治政府之難題」；不過印度的革命運動，其目的在建設完全獨立的國家，而非僅以自治爲滿足，因爲印度的民族，文化與英國澳洲等完全逈異，不能強而聯合，這點有熟慮。有待努力。</p>
<p>這次大戰予幕，先有羅邱宣言，聯合國宣言，明揭作戰目標，繼有羅斯福總統宜佈四大自由，更有莫斯科四國普遍安全宣言，最後凝成舊金山會議的聯合國憲章，都主張各民族得自由選　其政府，而弱小民族的革命運動，不能再用刺刀和監獄壓下去，不能再使世界一半自由，一半奴隸。今日世界已經縮小，安全是絕對不可分，沒有一個強大國家能獨立抵抗得住外侮，此次大戰，巳可證明，沒有一個國家能够單獨處得勝利，將來更甚，即使多數國家聯合起來，也還不能保證安全，必先策劃整個世界的和平，才得保證整個世界的安全·這是原子時代事實的敎訓，也是戰後世界和平發展的最大理由。</p>
<p>靑年學生最少個人利書和恩怨，滿懷正義感，一顆純潔的心，携　中國的王這哲學與各代表平等的合作，以謀印度　小民族和世界的安全和平，也許這種會　比巴黎和會來得有成　。中國量大開，當然是亞洲的領導國，但這種領導權不必爭，誰能領導得起，人家就會擁護領導的。</p>
<h3>國大十八次大會中　通過基本策章</h3>
<p>保障記者終未能列入憲草</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿四日電〕國大第十八次大會，今晨九時五十分舉行，出席一三一人，由孔祥熙主席，宣布開會後，由副秘書長雷震報吿主席團第廿八次會決議大愈延期至廿五日止，旋繼續二讀會程序，自第十二章基本國策關於國民經濟部份第一百四十條開始，修正案第一百四十條爲原案第一百四十二條，無異議通過。第一百四十一條爲對私有財當及私營事業一點，有丁錚城提出修正意見，認爲私人財富應有保障，私營事業應助其發展，不應加以限制，當丁發言完畢後，雷震曾提出說明謂係丁氏個人提案，並無附署，丁再發言請付討論，當經表決，佔少數，否決，並以多數通過維持原案，第一百四十二異議通過。劉振東等修正意見，擬於一百四十二條之後，增列一條，條文如次：「中央爲謀省與省間經濟之平衡發展，對於貧瘠之省，應酌予補助。省爲謀縣與縣間之經濟平衡發展，對於貧瘠之縣，應酌予補助。」劉並說明提案理由如决：（一）我國輻員廣大，各省經濟情形或各省之中縣與縣間之經濟情形相　懸殊，如不能對貧瘠之省縣酌予補助，即無法謀全國經濟之發展。（二）各省縣之經濟如不能獲平衡，則全國經濟發展自有極大阻碍，原草案中過於簡略，第七審查會曾補充數條，茲因綜合會復漏而未列，故應加以補充，付表決多數通過。第一百四十三條無異議通過。第一百四十四條崔唯吾等提修正意見，認爲應將一四四·一四五兩條合併，因前條僅規定一國家應依法管理金融，金融機構應有更切實具體之規定，而後條一所稱「平民金融機構」，意義復欠明確，故兩條合併後，予以修改，意義當可完善。當經表決，佔少數否決，並以多數通過原案。第一百四十五條，李文齋等提修正意見，認爲「平民」二字含義不明，應修改爲「農民」，其下則改爲「以充裕農村經濟改善農民生活」，偏於農民，一般意見認爲仍應爲「平民」以求包括普遍，表決以多數通過原案。第一百四十六條曾有擬修正改爲僑務專章者，惟表決後，終以多數通過原案。繼討論第十三章關於社會安全部份，自第一百四十七條始，至一百五十二條止，均無異議通過。第四節關於敎育文化部份，第一百五十三條吳聞天提修正意見，對科學等字限有所修改，經表決佔少數否決，仍以多數通過原案。第一百五十四條，王泊生提修正意見，並作說明，認爲今後我國復興之道應着重　術文化，王以一藝術家之身份，力說其重要性，擬請仍照原草案，但終以說明太長，未獲大部同　　意，致少數否決，而多數通過原案。第一百五十五條至第一百五十八條，均無異議通過，栗顯揚一曾提修正意見，在一百五十七條之後，增列一條「各級學樣應逐潮實行免費制度，俾貧寒子弟一得有協會接受高深敎育，以期造就大量人才」，特別着重於獎勵及扶助貧寒之優秀子弟，惟衆以不必在憲法內有所規定，表決後以少數否決。第一百五十九條，趙迺傳提出對敎育經費項下，預算總額下應增「經常支出」四字，表決仍以多數通過原案。第一百六十條「敎育科學及藝術之工作者，國家應保障其生活，並依國民經濟之進展，隨時提高其待遇」。陳亦低等提出修正條文「敎育科學藝術之工作者及新聞從業員，國家應給與工作之便利，曁保障其生活，並依國民經濟之進展，隨時提高其待遇」。陳曾至發言台說明，認爲新聞記者之權益，應予列入，惟因說明太長，而會議時間有限，故會場秩序稍形混亂。傳斯年在樓上擴言器前發言，會場聲浪甚多，傅力疾聲嘶稱新聞記者之工作非爲國家而做，不必列入，表決後，以少數否決修正案，在塲之旁聽新聞紀者，皆不勝惋惜。旋包明叔等提案，亦認爲該條文內應增「新聞一二字，包說明時曾謂，僅爭此兩個字，請各位高抬貴手，唯終以少數否決，多數通過原案。新聞記者未予列入。第一百六十一條王泊生亦提應增「藝術」二字，結果以多數通過原案。第一百六十二條，鄭曼靑等提在該條第一項下，加列一項爲一國內私人經營之醫藥事業，成績優良者」，其理由爲醫藥事業有關民族健康，而我國每年西藥入口數額尤足　人，爲求挽救，應增上列條文，當經傳斯年予以駁斥，訴說中醫之不當，語畢，表決以少數否決修正案，多數通過原案，當時有業中醫之代表丁仲英，於席中起立大呼「中醫也是中國人，簡直是侮辱中國人，大家都是中國人」。其聲浪似有凄然之感，態度亦極憤慨。旋即逕與三數人拂袖退席。最後討論第八審查會提增列之兩條：（一）第一百四十條，（二）第一百四十七條，均經六無異議通過。副秘書長宣佈下午　舉行二讀會。</p>

<p>九日本報松江訊：關於松江臨參會副議長張實治所提意見數點，不能無言，用本糾紛，所在之莘莊人立場，略抒管見，請益於賢明讀者之前。</p>
<p>莘莊自民國十六年始，即已劃定爲上海市暫暫接收區域之一部分，有當時行政院及市政府之核定劃界案卷圖表可資參證，逈非沿襲敵僞時期之情鄕行爲，實彰彰明甚。三十四年秋勝利和平，國土光復，松縣本身千端萬緒待治孔殷，視我莘莊如棄嬰，尤以有關國族興亡之敎育問題，始終未予理睬。迨一年後之今日，一切敎育行政設施，已由上海市政府辦理著有成效之情况下，始知收回管轄，夭下寗有是理。由知彼所舉之第一點理由，實無存在之價値。國父之大上海計劃。在當初確有對鎖租界經濟動脈之含意，戰後租界收回，原先之計劃，固需有相當之變更，然上海之地位，因國內共黨之不誠意，不合作，其他港埠缺乏安全與靈活，顯見較戰前更屬重要，人口密度，亦有增無减，大都市之設施，誠如本市趙工務局長之專論（見本年六月三十日本報星期論壇，必須切合：國防·經濟·文化·工商業·交通·等等多方面條件之需要，是以目前大上海計劃中之區域問題，非惟不以收回商業區之租界爲滿足，且更較戰前之預計需擴大多多，莘莊實爲理想中之良好住宅區，亦爲將來市區公路網重要之一環，其地位幾與戰前之翔股區相埒。中山路與浦東大道之開闢，市中心行政區，住宅區，及虬江碼頭之建設，在在說明戰前對於大上海計劃實施之一般，今應事實之需要，繼續推進至暫緩接收區域要求接收，乃屬事理之常，該張副議長之第二·三兩點意見，顯非事實。况此次要求接收，正是履行民國十六年行政院核定後之步驟，其第四點意見「……亦應由行政院內政部令飭劃定，今旣無前項明文……」云云，更屬矛盾之至一　總之，在今日情况之下，人民所盼望者，復興建設，樂業安居，屬市屬縣，同爲國家之地方機關，原無親怨軒輊之分，所爭者，民心民意之　趨，親民者得民心，自古已然。松江縣仁政不及於吾民，宜其不得吾民之愛戴，上海市一切設施，不分界域，盡其在我，所以博得我整個民意之擁　，洵非偶然事也。（闕水康）</p>
<h3>常熟徵賦手續商榷</h3>
<p>虞邑田賦，向有租業自業之分。全縣租業業戶居七成以上，自業不及三成。租業中住城區者約四分之三，今歲田賦改徵實物，改爲分區徵收，原欲便利人民，就近完納。惟全縣有八區，每區設四倉庫，而通知單上僅有田畝，坐落區名，又無某圖應向某一倉庫完納之說明，恐與便利人民就近完納之體恤適得其反。試舉一例以爲證明：假定有一租業戶，所有田畝散處八區，每一倉庫均須完納，如用一人專司其事，鄉城往返，以三日納一處，則全縣三十二處巳需二個月以上，而運費及個人膳宿等費殊爲可觀。因此屢次請求田糧處，從速改善征收方法，在城區業戶一律向城區倉庫完納，如因串已散區，則由收納倉庫出一臨時收據，俟鄉區將城區業戶糧串邀還田糧處，由執有臨時收據者，向田糧處倒換印串，則公私兩便，使人民免受額外之損失。（王楨）</p>
<h3>爲鎭江俊化堂請命</h3>
<p>鎭江俊化至善堂，沒有一個不知道他是憐貧恤隱濟厄扶困的地方慈善團體。該善堂爲地方慈善家于筱泉。曹　靑。孫靜芝先生等所創設，是貧民的寳庫，是窮人的救星。在抗戰以前，每屆歲寒時節，他們就施放米票。錢票。並發放寒衣，發放米粥，使一般貧苦無吿的大眾，藉以維持難度的嚴冬。鎮江自遭敵寇的洗劫，因此這個偌大省會裏的同胞，慘被屠殺者纍纍，彼時慘况，洵非筆墨所能狀其萬一。該堂在那敵氛囂張之下，執事人負，均奮不顧身，掩埋死屍，以免白骨狼藉，那種博愛精神，値得祟敬。時堂中收容難民極多，爲數約一千餘人，幸賴冬賑存米，得以每日三餐，勉强度日，獲救者至今猶歌功頌德。今年江北發生戰事，蘇北難民逃至鎭江者，　萬餘人，該堂擇其　　　獨，不能謀生者，俱一一救濟之。並規定每日晨間，散給饅首，中晚施放米粥或米飯，蘇北難胞，得免枵腹，該堂在大江南北，立有分堂三十餘所，專以渡世濟人，廣種福田爲示旨，並且救濟隱貧，不遺餘力，筆者曾於民廿八年間，應該堂當局之請，担任過此項列表造冊挨戶調查的工作，眼見得一般隱貧人士，在萬分苦難中，獲得實惠。該堂所有經費，悉賴地方當商，隨願樂助，並不向人募捐，惟年來物價高漲，預料該堂經費，至感竭蹶，如今又値隆冬的季候，臘鼓催殘，無衣無褐者，更所在皆是，筆者深望海內人士，直接的對於該堂，熱心匡助，那末造福人羣，比任何善舉，更多深長的意義啊！（馬協衷）</p>
<h3>爲機場地權呼籲</h3>
<p>筆者世居龍華西南吳馬家宅地方，商農兼營，本足自給。民國三十三年春，敵軍擴充龍華飛機場，我所有之耕地均被佔用，住屋尙未波及，至卅四年春再度擴充，則我之住屋亦遭波及矣。雖稱價收，能有幾何，然處於威迫之下，祇得忍痛遷居，總計二年同樣遭斯害者的二千餘戶，三十餘村落，房屋五千橡，田地五千餘畝之多。至去年秋抗戰吿勝，天日重光，始得重瞻故居，然三十三年被擴之地，仍未能自由使用，因被敵佔用時，掘　築城，未能越入，二步。今該地悉在中國中央兩航空公司繼續佔用中。按我龍華前已有飛機場之建築，爲歐亞航空公司所使用，係向當地民衆租用而付給相當租金，今中國中央兩航空公司佔用偌大之機場，則分文未付。筆者茲奉市地政局通知業戶須繳地價稅。竊以有權利然後有義務，今地上使用權，旣未能收回，遽責令盡納稅之義務。殊感不勝其負祖。惟因權證尙在余掌中，故遵納一部稅款，而實際使用土地之中國中央兩航空公司。對余以及許多土地權所有人，應如何减輕負担耶？茲閱報悉市參議會二屆會議在即，望各參議諸公提會討論，以謀得合理之辦法，而蘇民困爲幸。</p>
<h3>麥根路請派交通警</h3>
<p>我是市立恒豐路國民學校的學生，每天赴校必須經過武定路與麥根路之間，這裏是麥根路的車站，裝貨的卡車，絡繹不絕，任意疾駛，不顧行人的安全，此地亦無交通崗警，今天當我午時　家的時候，就被一輛急駛的卡車撞了，　致喪命，可是因無崗警，任其駛去，我昏倒長久，蒙同學扶持到校，我想要求警察當局，在武定路麥根路之間，添派崗警，維持交通，以策一羣幼年學生之安全　（恒獲收國民學校學生臧道宏）。</p>
<h3>雙橋人要求設車站</h3>
<p>蘇嘉公路在十二月十八日業已通車，人民稱便。據報載嘉興至雙橋粟價七百元，不料並不發售雙橋票，只能買王江涇的票子，因此票價要多費一倍，戰前變橋設站爲何現在沒有站了？希望路局迅速添設雙橋站，以免我們在物質上時間上受無謂犧牲啊！（夏頌年）。</p>
<h3>處理崇明漲沙議</h3>
<p>明北沿生田記述」一首，詳切情弊，誠不愧爲大衆之喉舌。余　均屬老苗，祖孫三代，賠累頗巨，今一旦復漲，於法於情，產權當然存在。民國三十二年省府遠　蘇院邊區，清算隔絕，該項生　，　篇少數人所報領。今承省府察出實情，予以撤廢，賢明之至。然撤廢後如何處置，尙未宣示。按該項沙灘，截至今日止，已近萬畝，更有向北擴展之勢。如漲速江北大陸，則此項良田，抑且爲國防要塞。老苗所有者，僅沿王公堤（蘇視王丹揆生前親自督建故名）北一狀而已。此後難免有沙病蕩棍，擅自覇種之事發生，果如是，則沙田糾紛，永無寗日，今歲秋間之械鬥，恐僅爲流血慘案之序慕耳。余輩深信國父「平均地權」「耕者有其田」之遺訓，深望省縣政府，不妨將萬畝良四，作爲實行新地制之試騅地區，於國於民，均無不便。質諸高明，以爲然吾？（崇明沙人）</p>

<h3>法決採堅強政策　維該在越南權益　萊克勒兼程赴越主持軍事　我總領要求劃中產區業經法方同意</h3>
<p>〔中央社昆明一十四日電〕廿三日上午九時，中國總領事至華越區內與僑領晤談，並試與越　　擊隊首領治商劃一中立區。法國莫利愛將軍完全同意開　中立區，集中華僑曁和平之越人。法軍控制區內華僑商店已恢復營業，對法當局及中國領館當局之努力，華僑甚感滿意。</p>
<p>〔聯合社巴黎廿三日電〕越南法軍今日以飛機及戰車掩護，在河內關市各要道推進，以期控制北圻，惟戰事現有即刻蔓延至南圻之勢。果爾，則越南全部將見砲火瀰漫。臨時政府總理勃魯姆在議會報吿，謂越南局勢嚴重，或將更趨惡劣，並說明決採取堅强應付政策，正趕派機械化戰著名軍事專家萊克勒將軍兼程赴前敵主持。河內法國當局指責越南民主共和軍殘殺法爾平民，　稱，當發見肢解屍體廿九具，內有女子十一人。法駐越專員達香禮歐已飛抵西貢，當地法軍事當局會至機場歡迎，達氏到後並無表示。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社巴黎廿三日電〕勃　姆總理本日在國民大會發表聲明，重申殖民地　長慕臺在三日前所主張之政策，簡言之，即勃魯姆內閣將保衛法國之權益，幷保護法國之　　。目前爲安全與防務起見，不得不採取之軍事措施，但仍希望能有一日實現新憲法所規定對屬地聯盟之政策。就法國利益之立場而言，對於越盟人士之强暴手段，自表反對，但目前計會主義之政府亦不以爲軍事手段可以解決一切。勃魯姆雖由明已採取一切防範措施，但亦承認舊日之武力殖民地制度，已不復適用於今日。各黨人士對此項政策之雙重方針，自未能完全瞭解，因此右派人士遂斥此爲讓步政策，以致造成今日之局面。反之，極左派人士則認爲本年三月六日與越盟共和國所訂之協定，越南法軍事當局幷未充分付諸實行，但國民議會目前似無使政府難堪之意。政府之兩種舉措，已在議會引起良好印象，其一，勃魯姆理與佚駐越高級專員達香禮歐意見完全一致，其二，勃魯姆派遺法國二次世界大戰名將萊克勒將軍，於週三赴越南主持機宜。</p>

<h3>戰後第二屆聖誕獻：但願和平普天下（續）</h3>
<p>戰後，近東方面局勢不靖，遠東方面和平亦未恢復，希望聖誕帶來和平的福音，讓地上的人類同蒙恩德……</p>
<p>〔聯合社倫教廿三日電〕第二次世界大戰結束十六個月，默洲與近東方面情形擾瓖，遠東方面和平也未恢復，下面是戰後第二次　誕節時遠東各國的寫照。</p>
<p>菲律賓　憲兵正跋涉呂宋島中部崎　山地，討伐游擊隊。游擊隊被稱爲叛軍，過去數月來征　結果，已有二千餘人喪生。游擊隊的前身是「人民抗日軍」，隊員富於游擊戰經騐。他們反對用暴力推翻政府，但堅持農業改革。</p>
<p>印度　敎徒領導的國大黨堅持獨立的印度，應爲統一共和國，而以印度敎徒居多數黨地位，回敎同盟則要求回敎徒各邦分治。加上其他宗敎與政治種種因素，使形勢更爲複雜。英國方面估計，自今年五月間英內團宣布印度獨立方案以來，因印回衝突而死的人。已超過一萬人。英國駐印軍隊不下五萬人，已經出動試圖彈壓暴動。</p>
<p>荷屬東印度　荷蘭與東印度獨立軍，幾經談判，雖已頒發停戰命令，但爪哇與蘇門答臘時有小衝突。談判結果，成立政治協定草約，規定在荷屬柬印度聯邦內，設立獨立的東印度合衆國。荷東估計約九千一百人，分駐在盟軍撤退前的舊界，擁有坦克車和飛機。東印度車隊，爪哇方面的有十四萬人，其中使有半數有武備·蘇·答臘有三師，其中十分之七有武備。衝突的繼續未已，原因有四：（一）十六個月來的憎恨未曾消滅；（二）口不應心，雙方多數軍人均反對和平解決，而欲武力解決；（三）東印度當局對於不正規游擊隊無約束力量。（四）有軍總司令於英軍撤絕後，宜有爲軍事安全起見，荷軍前綫推進一哩許，東印度方面認爲這是違反停戰協定</p>
<p>越南　法軍與越南獨立軍仍在戰爭，十月間的停戰命令無效。若干地點，戰况激烈。聞法軍有配備精良之軍隊五萬，並有少數飛機與小砲艦。越南軍隊包括正規軍與民團及年靑徵兵，數額似較法軍爲多。法方稱越軍中有日本兵在內。越軍擁有迫擊砲，機關搶和少數大砲，爭執中心在於南圻。越方要求南圻併入北圻與中圻北部，成爲共和國領土，法方則堅持該兩地應分立。上星期越軍在河內及北圻重行展開戰爭。法當局稱平民廿九人，包括婦女十一人，已被殺戮，屍體慘遭肢解。法方已在北圻與中圻南部宣布戒嚴狀態。又聞最近戰事中，法兵二百餘名斃命。</p>

<h3>建設大上海計劃　正由專家研討中</h3>
<p>太湖一帶設國家公園　浦東臨江闢爲住宅區</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕工務局日前在非正式之招待美國代表團席上，首度透露一廣及長江，乍浦，及太湖區之建設大上海五十年計劃。此一計劃草成於三月前，至今正由都市計劃委員會之六位建筑家及兩位工程司詳細研討中。該會由吳市長擔任主任委員，工務局長趙祖康擔任招待秘書。</p>
<p>據該會建筑家盧君於席間解釋稱：此一計劃分有交通綱實業區，住宅區與海港等部。其目的係欲使上海在實際與美麗之觀點上，皆能列爲世界最佳都市之一。上海在都市計劃上，較倫敦職紐約皆爲方便，因其並無有中國特色性或有價值建築物之限制。此種建築物實爲改革之障礙。上海目前之建築物大多陳舊不堪。新計劃包括有合宜之拆毀式作在內。其意義蓋在於使城市並不擠於一起，而公佈成許多獨立之市鎮，與上海市區聯繋而成一大城。此類市鎮再可分爲許多鄰　單位。各有交通相連。據確實估計，在未來一百萬居民之新上海中，目前局圍五十英方里之市區，將成爲此大城之心臟區，而可容納七百萬人。其餘之人口，則分佈於區，鎮，及鄰近地域。每一鄰近地域之單位，可容納四百至一百居民。上海本地將以環形公路與草地，和外圍地區分隔。此種草地即用爲散心養神之地。</p>
<p>工務局之建築家，對於工廠位置之設計，亦曾愼重考慮避免塵烟及其他各種因素。未來之上海，將向外擴展爲五區。各區皆有鐵道及汽車公路，與心臟區相通，此種公路並無交又之支路與交通燈，俾使汽車每小時可行六十英里。</p>
<p>計劃中亦曾述及目前港口之設備。擬劃定乍浦爲海港，吳淞爲河港。乍浦並有一流經龍華之河道，直通上海黃浦。</p>
<p>飛機塲之設備，則從目前之五處减少爲四處。將江灣機場搬往閘北，龍華機塲則使能適合西北偏西向之跑道。另在乍浦海港之後設一機塲。所有機場均足能負起國際交通任務。並與公路鐵道網等相聯接。</p>
<p>其次，在太湖一帶將設立國家公園。太湖南北將闢爲農業地帶，浦東靠臨黃浦之地域則闢作住宅區。</p>
<p>現在聖約翰大學執教之卜立克工程師，對盧君之言加以補充，並指出浦江大橋因不合實際與太糜費金錢，故在此計劃中已被刪略。卜氏並對該計劃有一異議，即對浦東之建設太少。</p>

<h3>罐頭食物漲風烈　商店主笑逐顏開</h3>

<h3>你要買新式汽車麼　先問問有沒有金條　這裏是最近的黑市價格調查</h3>
<p>〔本報特寫〕上海的汽車交易，是以金條計算的，好一點的車子，要賣到近二十根條子。然而還是有人要，而且供不應求。汽車商都異“同聲的說：「生意是有的，車子却沒有。」當然，你如果不在乎條子，也不難買到堂　簇新的汽車。海關不准出廠價格超過集金一千二百元的汽車進口，然而「大家有目共睹，馬路上並不缺少　華型的汽車。那麼它們是怎樣進來的呢？內幕人謂，兜得轉的人，自有辦法！</p>
<p>一方面由於海關限制進口，另一方面由於美國出產不够，所以今年進口的汽車，不過千　左右。上海的汽車商不到十家，經銷英美各廠出品。由於上述原因，訂貨雖很踴躍，交貨却頗困難。</p>
<p>現在正式由海關進口的汽車，美國的廠價，不過美金一千元左右，經銷商加上各種費用及利　，訂價約三千至四千元美金。不過目前市面的價格，的在美金七千元至一萬元的樣子。</p>
<p>〔別克牌」車子，在市面上相當受歡迎，現在就要賣到廿條，一共不過到了三十幾稱。「順風」一共到了四十輛，訂價美金三千元，市價却要十三條。「福特〕到的比較多。訂價二千餘美金，市價也要十三條。「水星」最近到了二輛，大的要十七八條。至於「林肯」現在不能進口，所以音樂聲的喇叭，我們還沒有聽到。</p>
<p>至於小汽車，新筆公司經銷的「司丹達」到了一百輛，以前訂貨，今年都可交齊，訂價三千六百元美金，市價也要十條樣子。小奧斯汀不很多。「飛埃特」到了八十輛，有小型和中型兩種，市價大的四條半到八條。　六汽缸的「克雷斯勒」最近有八輛進口，要賣到十八條。八汽缸的「派克」也有到貨，市價二十條出頭。</p>
<p>所以，我們現在可以看出來。上海的汽車交易，是畸形不合理的。你沒有辦法用公正的價格買到車子。有時候訂貨到了，經銷商也拒不交貨，必須補足黑市差額，他才把車子給你。</p>
<p>另外有些人，從美于國直接帶車子來，因爲照例，每人可帶一部汽車？算做行李。而這些車子，到了上海，就流入黑市。同時外埠有若干經銷商，因爲上海市價倘利，也就在本市做黑市生意。</p>
<p>買汽車的人，除了富商巨買之外，以銀行界爲量多。小汽車多爲醫師律師所購。</p>
<p>至於明年的汽車業怎樣呢？幾乎全部汽車商都搖頭。因爲進口的困難，美國明年汽車的載出量，雖可能增加，上海方面的車子，恐怕還要少。</p>
<h3>富民路歹徒槍傷警員　欄登路過汽車被逸去</h3>

<h3>市長解答三問題　百萬擔米備拋出　公教人員待遇年內可望調整　徵服兵役認爲可以鍜鍊身體</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕記者於昨日走訪吳市長，叩詢關於米價，年賞，徵兵等諸問題，當承答復如下：</p>
<p>問：最近米價　漲，未知市長曾注意及此而謀抑平吾？答：最近本市米價確有黑市發現，暴漲原因純由於受外匯之影響，深信數日後即可平息，本市食米絕無問題，現在本人手裏還　有食米一百餘萬担，到必要時便可以拿出來。</p>
<p>（二）問：工人之年賞問題，市長之意見若何？</p>
<p>答：關於職工之年賞問題，中央曾有命令規定，不准超過一個月，本人也以爲高工賣的後果，是造成工廠關門，工人失業。所以深盼勞資雙方能够互相諒解，太人對於此番紗廠工人之深明大義表示欣喜，彼等最初要求之年實爲五個月，而結果以四十天獲得和解。</p>
<p>（三）問：公務員平素待遇菲薄，生活淸苦，年關將屆，市府何以助之？</p>
<p>答：調整公務員待遇，蔣主席巳下手令，深信其明令於年內即可抵達此間，本市於奉命後，立可遵辦。若萬一於年底尙未奉命時，則市府或可設法暫先撥借一部分，然最好事先勿作宣揚，因即或市府有所補助，爲數必極微，徒令衆人引頸相待，而結果難免不失望也。</p>
<p>（四）問：市府明年度之預算，是否已經編製完成？敎育經費所佔之百分比如何？　答：明年度預算確已製就，刻由會計處整理中，其總數不超過明年之可能收入二千零三百餘億。敎育經費佔其百分之三十對於敎育，吾人必須儘力維護之。</p>
<p>（五）問：對於本市徽兵問題，吳市長有何意見？</p>
<p>答：自師管區司令傳正謨到上海後，徵兵工作應該積極展開。爲國服役是國民應盡的義務，一點沒有可怕，更不應逃避。本人假如有孩子到了徵兵的年齡，必定第一個送他入伍，藉此還可鍜鍊身體。</p>
<p>（六）問：市長如何度此聖誕佳節</p>
<p>答：爲公僕者沒有娛樂也沒有休息。這樣下去，恐怕倒是做市長要實行「拉伕」了。</p>

<h3>書業營業稅問題　財部允詳籌辦法　請願代表改定月初晉京</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市書商業同業公會，昨日下午三時，在西藏中路該會舉行緊急理監事聯席會議，到李伯嘉，張一渠，郭農山，徐伯昕，姚蓬子，劉季康，周熈和，蔣振湛，王子澄，唐文兌等十餘人，討論請求。免征書業營業稅問題，當決議所有請願代表，改定一月二日，再度赴京請願，向財政部面陳該業實際困難情形及免征理由，如不達到目的，即行全體停業。</p>
<p>部方批示</p>
<p>按該業爲免征營業稅，前曾如開臨時會員大會，當塲推派代表二十人，原定於昨日（二十四）赴京請願，適於動身之際，忽奉經濟部批示，故臨時召開緊急理監事聯席會議。經濟部原批如下：「前據該理事長曁該業代表郭農山等來部遞呈，懇請免征書商業營來稅一案，當經轉請財政部體念該業特殊情形，酌予免緩，並批示在案，茲准財政部本年十二月五日京直一〇九七〇字第六一〇四號公函略開：「查書業關係敎育文化，至爲重要，而戰時書業損失奇重，一時恢復不易，自屬實情，爲推行國策，維護文化事業起見，對於書業有予以扶植必要，惟書籍種類繁多，尙非全屬重要，若一律免征營業十稅，不惟偏頗失公，而其他各業難免不援例請免，影響稅征，現本部正詳籌妥善辦法，一俟核定，即可施行，相應函請查照」等由，特此通知，並轉飭知照」云云。</p>
<p>公會意見</p>
<p>該業公會於昨日理監事聯席會議中，群加研討，僉以財政部所列理由，十分牽强，蓋財政部若恐他業援例，則英法各國書籍免稅，而對化裝品均徵重稅，未聞因書籍免稅，而引起化裝品業之抗議，若謂書籍種類浩繁，孰輕孰重，難定標準，凡目前有正式出版地址及發行人之書籍，均有其文化上之意　與價値，見仁見智，絕無輕重之分，至一般　淫　盜之響，實際上並無出版地點，即欲徵稅，亦不可能，况敎科書已免徵於先，而一般書籍自不能不在免徵之列，蓋任何一國代表文化之書籍，舉世認爲一般書籍，而非敎科書。</p>
<p>文化貨款</p>
<p>記者爲了解目前　業情形，走訪該會負責人，據談：該會現有會員二百六十八家中，僅寥寥數家可以勉强維持，絕大多數均因成本過高，讀者購買力降低及高利貸之壓迫，勢將陷於絕境。目前銷路最佳者，爲色情書籍，其决差强人意者，則爲兒童讀物，因後者售價低廉故也，至於一般理論及新文藝書籍，比較滯銷，難操勝劵，外埠銷路則因交通尙未恢復，郵費高昂，除色情書籍外，一時頗少開展希望。該負責人稱：文化爲立國大本，政府實應洞察機微。除全免營業稅外，尙須給予文化貸欲，以挽救當前書業之危機。聞該業公會此次請願，對於文化貸款，亦有專文呈請云。</p>

<h3>歐哈德案西伯受審　否認參與諜報工作</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨日美軍法庭繼續開審歐哈德案，受審者係前德國駐廣州領事西伯。</p>
<p>西伯供稱：德國投降後彼之責任爲指示在粵德籍僑民，彼承認當時仍保留領事名義，對於軸心國之任務亦未變更，其理由爲並未奉到德國政府之正式解職命令。檢察官奧康納上校當即詰以何謂「無條件投降」？西伯本人係一法學博士，其答覆如下：無條件投降乃戰敗國之一方無條件向戰勝國一方投降之謂」。</p>
<p>西伯復承認彼知悉歐哈德局廣州支部之哈瑟，烏勃里區，尼門三人於德投降後繼續從事諜報工作，但彼本人從未參與其事，其原因有四點（一）上峯曾指示勿干涉哈瑟之工作，（二）哈瑟直接受歐哈德局之指揮，（三）彼本人之工作僅在德僑民方面，而哈瑟則兼爲德日兩方工作，（四）日軍當局亦囑彼勿干預哈瑟之事。</p>

<p>（一）工作概况：本會於本月十日成立，每週二三五日各開例會一次，以便隨時審核申請案件，檢討各種重要問題。迄今已開例會五次，各重要章則，業經訂定。如申請貸款須知貸款審核通則，貸款案件處理辦法等多種，均經公佈。所有由請書表，已趕印　備，分　國家行局及商業行莊，以備各廠索取塡用。</p>
<p>（二）申請手續：本會接受申請，以工廠爲對象，不以業別爲對象。因各業中良莠不齊，不能不稍加決擇，就其健全者，予以協助。俾國家有限之資力，獲得有效之運用，原則上盼　有往來之行莊核轉。因各廠之信用，及其資金需要情形，惟有　有在往來之行莊知之最切也。</p>
<p>（三）貸款條件貸款利率，特予减低，規定爲月息四分，借款百分之五十，幷得以機器廠房作抵</p>
<p>（四）貸款數額：視各廠實際需要，個別核定，並未預定數額。蓋未經各業申請之前，無法預爲估計。外間傳說種種數字，均爲猜測之辭。</p>
<p>（五）核定手續：各申請廠家，如能照本會規定，備具應有書表，初步調查審核，及經提會核定等手續，一星期內即可以辦理完竣。而經會議決定，交由行莊承辦之案，亦經規定於三日內簽的具報。總之，貸款案件之處理，在本會及各行莊方面，常儘量迅速。所望各申請工廠，亦於事前詳閱由請須知，完備應具手續。同時對調查人員，予以便利，供給必需資料，則遲延更可减少。</p>
<p>（六）事後考核：過去國家銀行放款，事前審查頗僞嚴格，而事後考核未免寬疏，易滋流弊。此次本會辦理生產貸款，事前審　與事後考核，同等重視。故經規定由承放行莊派員稽核借款人資金運用，復由本會設置巡迥稽核，隨時抽查，務使貸款用於生產。將來如發現有作僞取巧之徒，決請主管機關嚴處。更盼與論界發揮正論，有力制裁。目前工業危機原因不一，如高利貸，高工資，及外貨之競爭，運輸之困難，購置力之低落等等，非金融一端所能解救。常局有鑒於此，已舫有關主管機關，籌擬對策，以期克服困難。如今後各廠對於貸款善爲利用，改善技術，減低成本，增加產量，提高品質，爲本身奠定基礎，則經濟復與可預下也。</p>
<p>最後霍氏復就各記者提出之問題，分別作答。茲誌其大要如决：（一）該會組織，以中央銀行爲主體，再以國家三行一局，及商業行莊等爲輔。（二）申請者務必以自身病症，和盤托出，特別爲生產成本，務須實報，俾便該會對症下藥。（三）申請貸款數額，務求合理。例如最近會發現有某廠一年之營業總額僅八億元，然由請貸款之數額，竟達數十億元。此項現象不應有，否則，徒事延冗調查賽核之時間。（四）調查工作，現共分兩部進行。關於業務及財務方面，委託聯合徵信所調查。技術方面，則委託經濟部調查。</p>
<h3>壓力加重銀根抽緊　金價昨賡續下跌　美鈔港票均連帶回小</h3>
<p>烚赤昨續在壓力加重及銀根奇緊之情形下，賡續下跌，晨開即喊三七〇萬　出，難獲對手，三六八萬始有成交，一時賣氣逾恒，供方過湧，立即下游，破入三六〇萬大關，十時後央仃以三五五萬之價，配給五五條，入後買氣更爲沉滯，央行肆意力壓，銀根加緊，有跌難漲，曾破入三四〇萬大關，而後稍穩，淮三四五萬左右亦不易持久，午刻在三四二萬掙扎，午後隔日交割上場平平，三時後散買忽有誤解，曾迫近三五○萬關，後以壓力仍有，最後仍在三四三萬，結果較前收再跌二十萬，飾金卅七萬，銀元再昂，暗拆銀根更緊，暗息昂至至二角光景。</p>
<p>外幣昨亦下落，美鈔晨關七〇〇〇元有售，逐步趨疲，午刻降至六五〇〇元低價，午後微形穩定，在六六〇〇元至六八〇〇元之間　徊，較前收續跌二〇〇元，港票昨以申電回上至七六元，亦吿下降，最後在一三五〇元左右徘徊，較前收下降八十元，港匯自一三八〇元，退落至一三三〇元，印匯一六五〇元，英匯二一五〇〇元左右，交易仍以港匯較活，餘均呆滯。</p>
<h3>公債回跌</h3>
<p>公債昨亦受普遍恐慌而見跌，統丙晨開即降爲一四〇〇元，低價一三八〇元，此後即有補空活動，逐步盤升至一六三〇元，但人心不　，最後仍退至一四二〇元，掙扎結果，較前收回跌四三〇元，甲乙跌三八〇元，統丁統戊各挫二八〇元，成交的四百餘萬元。</p>
<h3>滬鹽貸銀團　貸出一九〇億</h3>
<p>上海區食鹽貸款銀國，卅五年度工作業已吿一段落，昨日該國發表本年度各轄區貸款數字共一九〇億元，其中以蚌徐特區最多，江寗區最少，茲探誌詳細數字如下：河南三，七五三，二七〇，〇〇〇元，河北五一七，七九一，〇〇〇元，湖南一，一七四，〇〇〇，〇〇〇元，安徵三四八，七〇〇，〇〇〇元，蚱徐三，八八〇，〇三六，八〇〇元，江西一六九，〇〇〇，〇〇〇元，江寗一一，〇〇〇，〇〇〇元，預又押匯四〇六，三〇四，〇〇〇元，保付期稅五六〇，〇八三，二〇〇元，貼現漢口六，〇七三，〇七四，〇〇〇元，總計一九，〇五九，九一九，〇〇〇元。</p>
<h3>絲綢急轉直下</h3>
<p>昨廠經因金價急轉直下，以致人心煥散，市况下降，D字等級做開五百萬元，開口貨做價四百八十萬元，有幾担成交，比上日最大價跌落三四十萬元，干經等俱無交易，一般業中人尙須看軟，故昨市異常寂靜。人造絲一二〇號，有光因現貨充斥，故亦低回，東洋牌場內喊六十萬元賣出，高山牌喊四十六萬元，無光做開三百八十萬元，較上日小去五萬至八萬元之譜，半光貨奇缺，且廠銷甚股，是以昨價反見高昂。綢公美亞被面昨喊三百〇五萬元，但三百萬元尙乏人過問，大誠被面喊二百九十萬元賣出八十萬元買進，格子璧縐雖喊到萬元，不過買方只出九千五百元，大偉呢走銷尙佳，昨市略高，杭貨產地報漲，昨申市又大一百元，餘皆平庸無變更。</p>
<h3>華南走私猖獗　桐油來源受阻</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕桐油因華南走私猖獗，影響本市來源，據悉不但福建出產者悉數南運，即過去集中溫州之桐油，向例運銷上海者，亦全部經由香港出口。社會局爲此特於昨日邀中國植物油廠，本市造漆業公會，桐油業公會舉行談話會，商討對策，一致同意函請經濟部設法杜絕筆南走私。</p>
<h3>管制布新案　民營紗廠寗願停工　不能隨便接受　對於收購數量及利潤　均不能同意政府規定</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕六區棉紡業公會於昨日召開上海紗廠臨時會員大會，出席代表三十人以上，由王啟宇氏任主席。首先報吿第十七次紡管會已根據宋院長對於管制紗布之六點指示，議決穩定紗價之新辦法，要點如下：</p>
<p>（一）凡已購外棉及擬購外棉之紗廠，自即日起所製之棉紗，由政府收購其半數，如自將棉紗織布者，得收購其棉布。</p>
<p>（二）收購價格除以各廠生產量百分之十，照成本售與政府外，其餘百分之四十，照成本加合法利潤百分之二十二。上項價格由紗管會指派代表一人，紡建公司及民營各廠各推代表一人，紀織審議會核定之。</p>
<p>（三）除被收購外所餘之紗布，由各廠集中市塲公開交易（上海擬借用紗布交易所舊址）上項交易之買賣戶名數額及用途，按日編製詳表送主管機關審核。</p>
<p>（四）政府爲運用所有收購之紗布，作爲平衡紗布價格之用。上項配售價格，如較收購價有盈額時，由政府專戶存儲，爲輔助棉花生產及發展紡織業之用。</p>
<p>（五）此後各廠由政府供給外匯所購之棉花製成之紗布，百分之七十由政府收購；其中百分之十按照成本售與政府，百分之六十照成本加合法利潤百分之二十二。其購用國棉所製之紗布，得按第三條辦法自行買賣。</p>
<p>（六）本辦法俟紗布市價相當穩定時停止之。</p>
<p>主席報吿後，出席會員對新辦法詳加研討，歸納各項意見，主要者有三點：（一）關於新辦法第一條政府收購已紡成之棉紗棉布半數之規定，不同意。（二）關於新辦法第二條利潤之規定，暫時不談。（三）對於新辦法第五條亦不同意，堅持政府收購數量不能超過百分之五十。並認爲如完全接受新辦法，則無異爲一紙賣身契，寗願全部停工，亦不願隨便接受。</p>
<p>惟在行政當局方面，亦有其不得已之苦衷，即在新辦法已實施新棉未來之六個月內，政府必須在全國收購三萬三千件棉紗，在本市收購二萬四千件棉紗，然後以量控價，方能收穩定紗布市價之功。政府旣已開放美棉外匯，以廉價原料供應民營紗廠，則自應有權作合理之收驟，統籌支配，以增進一般人民之利益。</p>
<h3>複製業四期四次配紗　逾期尙未撥出</h3>
<p>本市棉紗複製品工業公會配紗委員會第四期第四次配紗，原經紡管會規定通知應於本月二十三日核配，惟廿三日六區棉紡公會因手續尙未辦齊，致未配出，須於廿四日辦理，昨日下午仍未照配，聞因六區公會呈請調整議價關係云。</p>
<h3>油價微跌米市堅定</h3>
<p>米市南北共到一萬二千餘石，北粳因內地價昂，划申不合，來源寥寥，做開甚少，南粳到貨尙有，供應照常，均以審議價格成交，白陰元仍少榮辱，秈米無正式交易，黃豆升沉互有，杜豆略見挺秀，東北大豆回小千餘元，生仁外埠去胃轉淡，回跌二三千元，芝蔴下挫千元，蠶豆仍少上落，苞米靑　收購頗濃，續昂千餘元，紅糧因酒坊甚食，價格步漲一二千元，粉市積漲五百元，麩皮亦升一二百元，油市店胃轉淡，生油回跌三四千元，豆油平平，蔴油亦小三四千元，豆餅銷化轉淡，價疲二三百元。</p>
<h3>年關漸近購買增多　南北貨價格步漲</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕南北貨業近內金價上揚，刺激人心，購進儲藏者甚多，生意極佳。計海味洋貨價格上漲百分之五十至七十，原因除金價剌激之外，並有進口將受限制　言之影響。事實上，明年一月五日起，將有美輪載運大批海味抵滬。北貨價格亦因受金價刺激，上漲百分之二中左右。據南貨業公會常務理事許伯良吿記者：南北貨價格在今年一年之內，上漲平均四·三倍。因目前之京氣，故該業今年可略有盈餘。該業因年賞一度發生工潮，但爲時短促，一日即吿解決，現決定於　　年關多發薪水一月，作爲年終獎勵。</p>
<h3>多頭心思動搖　紗綫普遍下降</h3>
<p>昨日紗市以黃金續見劇跌，業中人多頭心思動搖，競相出籠，貶價求售，行市乃一瀉無餘，客帮亦以銀根緊急，束手觀望，各支紗綫普遍下跌五萬至十萬之譜，趨勢似仍脆弱。</p>
<h3>糖價略回</h3>
<p>昨糖市已見回平，公會劃盤現貨中砂白小三四千元，生砂赤小萬元，廣帮開出潤德靑二百餘包，十二萬七八千元，小二三千元，建帮刁靑以貨少尙堅，開十二萬八千五百元，漳赤十四萬二千元，其他零星成交，亦均回　。</p>
<h3>茶市依然沉寂</h3>
<p>洋莊本市，售價昂騰之本年度新茶市勢依然岑寂，惟溫州新珍眉，邇來各出口行尙擬稍作染指想，惜該項花色，自日前被午昌茶葉公司一掃而空以來，存底幾巳吿罄，故刻下縱有少數存貨，賣戶亦以奇貨可居，不忍割愛，是以交易卒未做關，他若品質較佳之陳貨，脫手並不遲鈍，過程比前帶堅，炒靑毛茶價格亦頻趨　境，新中　炒軋升萬元之　，每担　十二萬元左右。</p>
<h3>天寳豐銀樓　宣吿清理</h3>
<p>太市河南路四三七號（南京路口）天寳　銀樓，昨以該號經理鄒仁濟突吿失蹤之理由，業已委託陳心田。馬叔庸二律師於昨日起正式宣吿淸理。所有債權情務雙方，統限自即日起七日內登記竣事，以憑依法分別處理。</p>
<h3>煤市轉軟</h3>
<p>煤市烟煤因近來　管會管制較爲鬆弛，淮南煤等自南京鎭江等地續有運來，並各廠購得配煤後，爲調劑銀根，亦有乘高向市場拋售，故市况已漸轉　動，市價徵見回降。白煤除淸鴻基塊仍穩站百萬高峯，焦作煤等均見微回，白煤屑各煤球製造廠有　貨訊，去胃頗爲遜色，然貨主猶圖扳住，價尙在四十萬關外。</p>
<h3>銀錢業頭寸緊　交換時有問題</h3>
<p>速日金價飛騰，全市　資幾有孤注一擲之　，經央行前昨力拋萬餘條後，銀根抽緊四百餘億，是以昨日銀錢業咸感頭寸緊迫，交換時頗多難以軋平，間有斬售黃金予央行，藉以彌補缺單者，但大部尙無多大問題。</p>
<h3>美國麵粉到滬</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕怡和外洋部經理之蘭克阿脫林號，昨自溫哥華抵埠，運來麵粉六千噸，係中信局購來。</p>
<h3>春絲收購已畢</h3>
<p>中信局收購生絲，先後已達十七批，總計六千二百二十五担，關於春絲部份，大都均已解送完舉，惟其中春絲細條紋十三分十五，原定以五〇〇担爲限，今已解交足額，旋因廠商要求續收，已獲中信局同意，昨日已由該局函知中蠶公司，再予續收一百担，以三十六年一月十二日以前，爲有劾時期，中蠶公司接函後，即於日內解送之十八批中，附解四十担，至於秋絲收購，因成本核實問題，尙須待政院核准後，再行開始。</p>

<p>外股亦隨金價影響而再降，成交不多，維持無勁，結果較前收計怡紗英聯航業紙業各跌一成光景，會德關業廣恰啤跌半成，銅業獨跌一成半。</p>

<p>〔本報南京二十四日電）敎部以在戰時所頒布保國民學校，鄉鎭中心國民學校籌集基金獎勵辦法，現時已不適用，因按照民國二十八九年生活情形所定獎勵金額，數目甚小，現時如依其數獎勵，實無濟於事，若按現在物價情形加高倍數致獎，公家亦無此一筆龐大經費專款，故特明令廢止。聞此項獎勵辦法黎廢止後，倘簿集基金驚心興學者，可援用捐款與學例，分別給予名譽獎勵，發給獎狀。</p>

<p>陳霖笙君　評論球藝</p>
<p>又精武盃第五　個人錦標賽，五組冠軍，球藝均臻妙境，尤以快抽王友信，更爲絕佳，金龍乒乓球隊指導陳霖笙（本屆錦標賽續裁判）對五組冠軍評論如後：</p>
<p>王友信</p>
<p>專攻抽球，急而有力，正反俱佳，尤以反手爲最，出手快，抽擊爽脆乾凈，善於奔跑，爲目下乒乓界最優之抽手，其勁敵爲薛緒初傳其芳二人，薛傳因故暫吿退休，王君自可所向無敵，本屆不難圓其錦標之宿願。</p>
<p>張孚瑋</p>
<p>抽削兼長，均臻妙境，比賽時非常認眞，抽多於削，尤以正抽有勁，成名較王友信爲早，目下球藝已稍遜一籌，如能不驕不餒，當可與友信開運二將一決雌雄。</p>
<p>楊開運</p>
<p>善於攻球，姿勢美觀，抽球異常穩健，不善反抽，吃少，削球亦佳，惜乏旋轉性優點常能於削球時作反攻抽擊，平日不常練習，球藝不見退步，亦天才也。</p>
<p>李震</p>
<p>精於削球，不尙花巧，　球高低疾徐，頗能得心應手，惟削出之球頗高，易爲對方抽擊，幸賴其牛皮性之耐戰，常能反敗爲勝，比賽時態度鎭靜，爲其優點。</p>
<p>張善達</p>
<p>攻守全材，身材瘦長，攻球時頗佔便宜，張係新人，此次編入第三組角逐，竟能力挫種子吳祚昌，擊敗健將水涵高，奪獲冠軍一席，可謂一鳴驚人，張之崛起·誠爲本屆盃賽唯一之收穫。</p>

<h3>聖誕節考</h3>
<p>本報資料室</p>
<p>每年的二月二十五日，全世界到處慶祝，來紀念這偉大的人類救主—耶穌。</p>
<p>在聖經中，有關於耶穌基督降生的記載：</p>
<p>耶穌的母親馬利亞在尙未和的瑟結婚以前，忽然有了孕，乃是受聖靈感動所致。的瑟聽到了這消息，雖然不肯顯明地把她羞辱一番，但也不願意把她娶回來，暗中計劃如何把他的未婚妻休了，正在思慮的時候，忽然做了一夢，告訴他，他的妻子懷孕，是受聖靈感動的緣故，將來所生的孩子，要拯救百姓，超脫他們所犯的罪惡，乃世界上萬民的救主。應該把她娶過米，不必多生疑竇。同時又告訴他，生下來的孩子，要給他起名呌耶穌。的瑟醒來之後，亳不懷疑，遵照夢中所指示，把馬利亞娶了過來。可是沒有同房，直等她腹中的孩子生了下來。</p>
<p>的瑟和馬利亞結婚不久，忽然督撫該撤亞古士有旨意下來，呌天下人民，各歸各城，報名上冊。他們兩人也從加利利的拿撤勒城，趕到大衛的伯利恒去報名上冊。那時馬利亞已快足月了，到了伯利恒，却找不到客店，就住在一處馬房裏。馬利亞在那裏便分娩了，把生下來的孩子，用布包了起來，放在馬槽裏，起名呌做耶穌。</p>
<p>耶穌生下來後束方博士，夜見星象特地來找尋尋到了馬利亞和這小孩子，使俯伏跪拜，獻上黃金，乳香和未藥，作爲禮物。</p>
<p>司時在伯利且郊外的原野上，有盛大的羊羣，由牧羊人看守着，晚上也按着更决，輪流地看守。有天晚上，忽然天使降臨了，露出閃閃的光，使牧羊人看了懼怕。天使對收羊人說：「我是來給你們報喜訊的，不必害怕。今天在大衛城裏，世界上萬民的救主基督，已降生了。你們要找到一個嬰兒，用布包着，臥在馬槽裏的，那就是他。」說舉一隊天兵，簇擁着天使，升天而去，在月朗星稀的天空裏，隱的地當能聽到稱頌上帝的歌聲。</p>
<p>第二天一淸早，牧羊人照着天使的話，趕到伯利恒去，找到了馬利亞和的瑟，又看見了那嬰兒。天使的話是證實了。不久，救主基督誕生的話，從牧羊人的口中，傳遍了大衛城。</p>
<p>上面是聖經中所記載關於耶穌降生的事，並沒有說明耶穌是生在那一天。相傳常收羊人來報喜訊的一天，是十二月廿五日，於是就定這一天爲聖誕節，但這一天可不是耶穌基督降生的日子。</p>
<p>關於耶穌誕生的日期，在五世紀以前，有幾種不同的說法，一說是一月六日，一說是三月廿五日，另一說則是十二月廿五日。至第四世紀，羅馬人才定十二月廿五日爲聖誕節，於是聖誕節的日期從此便確定了。此外還有兩種考證：一說耶穌誕生的日期，用希伯來的曆法來推算，應爲四月二十日。另一說是根據埃及曆法來推算的，則應爲五月二十日。究竟原來耶穌生的日期，應據那一種曆法，很難斷言。連耶穌降生的年份，現在還是衆說紛紜。最早是厄克斯哥，推定其生年爲羅馬紀元七五三年，即目今沿用的公歷耙元。但後世學者認厄克斯哥的推算有誤。應在紀元前四年或八年。生年尙有爭執，降生日期當然更無法斷定。</p>
<p>聖誕節的傳說，旣不易斷定，所以另外又有一較圓通的說法，這不長根據歷史的考證來推定，而是從社會進化過程上臆測得來的。每年冬今，歐洲各民族有一個相同的節令，人民狂歡地慶祝，後來基督敎徒，就把這節日來慶祝耶誕，以代替原來的　藥。好在大都數的人，不過假耶誕節的名義，盡興行樂罷了，聖誕節應該在那一天，似乎是無足重輕的。故在歐西各國慶祝耶誕的習俗中，至今還可以發現許多古代民族節季游樂的風尙。</p>

<h3>聖誕食品火鷄</h3>
<p>每逢節日，總有些應時食品。例如端午節的粽子，中秋節的月餅皆是。以冬至而論，中國人照例磨粉做糕圓，而西人慶祝聖誕節，則以火鷄爲必不可少的應時食品。這一點，似中西同出轍，可說是「每逢佳節倍思「吃」」了。</p>
<p>耶誕近聲價高</p>
<p>火鷄是聖誕盛饌中必備之菜，其名貴不亞於我國的燕窩角翅。送人的禮品中，火鷄也是少他不來的。一到聖誕前夕，火鷄售價立刻高漲，「聲價萬倍」，窮人們只能呆在櫉窗乘涎。記得去年的聖誕節，火鷄來貨不多，售價旣昂，又不容易買得到。範圍較小的酒家，無從應市，巧手的廚子只好用鷄肉製成冒牌的火鷄。</p>
<p>這裏先來描摹一下火鷄的芳容：</p>
<p>火鷄一名吐緩鷄，身材高大，雄的的高三尺許，雌的略小，上嘴部生有肉冉，能伸縮自如，伸時長達二三寸，披垂於嘴下。顏色紅綠相間，非常悅目。「嬌軀」過重，行動蹣跚，肉極豐肥，味亦俊美絕倫。</p>
<p>派專輪購火鷄</p>
<p>在英國，每年聖誕將屆，必向東南歐購買大批火鷄，特地開往南斯拉夫的專輪，常達一百五十艘至二百艘之多。上海的火鷄大都來自定海，戰前每年由定海運來的火鷄，約在三萬只以上。據說，定海農民飼育火鷄，開始於道光年間雅片戰爭之後，英人曾佔據定海，軍營中携來火鷄甚多，在英軍離開定海後，留下了火鷄的種。當地農民以火鷄體態別緻，肌肉豐滿，於是相率留養，產量年有增加，遂成爲定海的特產。</p>
<p>養火鷄大不易</p>
<p>但飼養火鷄並不容易，火鷄孵化後，雛鶴頗難養活，聞着油氣便會死掉，較中國的土鷄難養得多。而且火鷄的食料，以五穀爲最宜，而鄉人由於經濟關係，大都任其在外吃草，因此中國的火鷄，沒有美國的大，美國的火鷄，每只通常重二十餘斤，而中國火鷄，最重的不過十餘斤，普通不過四五斤而已。</p>
<p>如果我們能用科學方法來飼養火鵝，政府方面，儘量予行銷者以便利，那也不難與舶來品一較短長的。我以爲此舉，不獨有補於農民的生計，抑且足以推行國產，彌補漏巵，何妨予以鼓勵！</p>
<h3>聖誕樹</h3>
<p>慶祝聖誕的時候，聖誕樹是件不可缺少的　飾品，掛燈結　，其情調相當的美。耶穌常敎調人爲善　務，須要多結果子，所以在聖誕節陳列這棵光彩煥發的樹，正合他的敎訓，含有深切的意義。</p>
<p>但是說起聖誕樹的來歷，倒不是基督敎人首先提個的。它的起源，也是衆說紛紜，莫衷一是。</p>
<p>有人說：德國人喜歡戶外生活，所以每逢他們的節期，大家在野外樹林之中，掛燈結綵，男女老幼，狂歡其間。表示慶祝，後來此種慶祝方法，各國漸漸效尤，基督敎徒，也模倣這種風俗，來慶祝耶穌聖誕。有的因爲附近沒有樹林，就設法掘得一樹，負之回家，加紥燈綵，後人遂爾沿用，喚做聖誕樹。</p>
<p>另一晚：這是聖文佛利想出來的。有一次，他在林中砍一株大橡樹時，一陣在風掠過，樹木都被吹倒，獨有一株小杉樹，兀立不動，聖文佛利遂宣稱這是聖樹。由此以後，聖誕節就用它來作點綴品了。</p>
<p>還有一說是：路德因爲要使他的孩子看星光下雪樹的景　，在園中砍了一株小杉樹，擺在房內，上面燃起蠟燭來，是日正爲聖誕節前夕，後人因此相沿成習。</p>
<p>還有聖誕節所用冬靑，其起源也很早了，古代羅馬人用桂枝作爲和平，勝利與快樂的象微，其後基督敎徒因襲着這種傳說，用桂枝點綴窗戶。英國人把冬靑代替了桂枝，它的意義是：冬靑的白色底花象徵着聖誕，紅色底實象徵着耶穌爲罪人所流的鮮血，冬靑編的花團更代表着耶穌殉難時頭上戴着的棘刺王冠（本報資料室）</p>

<h3>深入太湖察匪情　訪毛森將軍</h3>
<p>— 本報特派記者吳守仁</p>
<p>蘇州十六日訊</p>
<p>毛森少將自從破獲了震驚全國的麵粉大王榮德生被綁鉅案後，聲譽鵲起，差不多婦孺皆知。本年九月間，無錫指揮所成立，他榮膺參謀長的新命，從此更肩荷起保障江南治安的重任。</p>
<p>毛森少將　談江南大清剿</p>
<p>七日下午二時卅分，錢塘號的專車，把毛少將從無錫送抵了蘇州。記者與他尙係初會，所得的第一個印象，是待人的豪爽和熟誠。第二個印象，是短小精悍的身材，不如我想像中那末魁梧高大，英俊的臉部，襯托着筆直的鼻樑，高聳的顴骨，扶着深凹的眼眶，濃黑的眉毛顯得二顆大眼珠特別有神，突出稍尖形的口部出充分的飽滿的頭額，十足顯示和這是一位善於思索，善於指揮的幹練人物。</p>
<p>毛森少將在蘇州城區，幷沒有停留，僅在能者初會的寒暄和陳述準備跟隨深入太湖水區的要求時，稍躭延了幾分鐘。汽車立刻把我們送向木凟鎭出發。二十七里的公路旅程，需時的四十分鐘，在這一個空閒時間裘，記者和毛少將作了多方面的暢談。他關心蘇州的一切，像官吏操守，役政情况，軍隊紀律，人民生活，一類的事，都不厭求詳地向記者詢問。記者知道毛森少將所負荷的，不僅是治安上的責任，尙有其原來的本位工作。這一種本位工作，假使一定要用什麼專門名詞來說明它的話，那末「綏蜻糾察」四個字似乎還稱適宜。惟其因爲毛少將賦有綏靖糾察的任務，他的詢問當然不是普通的酬酢，也絕不會希望聽到一片歌功頌德的粉飾話，這是可以斷言的。因此，記者儘可能就見聞所及，把地方情形扼要地談了幾點。他對於蘇州商業經濟日瀕崩潰邊緣的趨向，表示十分驚訝和關切。尤其是三四個月來，倒閉的糧食業達三百家以上的一點，傾注了異常注意的神情。記者當然也不會放棄這展開採訪的最適宜時間，於是就江南淸剿過程，治安狀况諸問題，提出了許多探詢。毛少將除了關於數字方面的問題，因隨身沒有備忘文件的關係，不能正　作　外，其他都是很坦真地答覆。據他非常有把握地表示：江南地區已經沒有股匪，所流竄的散匪至多決不超過五百名。對這五百名左右散匪的肅淸問題，準備俟各淸剿區工作結束後，實施各縣聯防，被此截堵，彼此兜剿，務期澈底殲滅。毛少將在結束了答詢之後，幷就綏蜻工作的重點，發表了他的卓見說；「要澈底收綏靖的功效，單靠淸剿武力是不能竟全功的。我在發動江南大淸剿的時候，曾命令各淸剿區指揮官，以招撫爲推動工作的第一步。次則加强地方自衛力量，健全各縣保甲編制，這些都是駕乎武力淸剿之上的措施」。眞的，「攻心爲上，」假使更能在剿撫兼施之餘，展開廣泛的民運工作，則各淸剿區的成就，必然能够愈益偉大，也更可奠定江兩長治久安的　　。</p>
<p>車抵木賣鎭，天色陰沉，西北風裏　起　　的　雨。太湖消　指揮部各官佐，除指揮官傳鏡方已赴宜興張渚兼任蘇浙皖邊淸剿區指揮官，曁副指揮官劉宏德正在滬有所公幹外，其他自參謀主任楊錚以下，均列隊在汽車站歡迎。木凟的老百姓也簇擁了一大堆，在臨時警戒綫外，閃動着新奇的目光，爭相瞻仰毛森少將的豐采。細雨下，我們走向指揮部。這是位在木凟東街的一座古老住宅，建築很堅固，屋宇非常寬廣深邃，大槪是地方上縉紳的遺居。收拾得十分整潔，一點也看不出給軍事機關所借用着的零亂樣子。在總辦公室中，各踝股的主管人分別提出了工作報吿。毛將軍一面聽，一面翻閱表冊，有時還扼要垂詢，看他耳，目，口三者並用，顯得非常悠閑從容。</p>

<p>太湖地區經過了快三個月的剿撫兼施，各大股著匪歸順的歸順，伏法的伏法，迄今仍樹叛幟的僅薛永輝，周世觀等股，及少數零星散匪而已。他們所以能拒絕招撫，規避淸剿，在江南農村的一角苟延殘喘，實在也有其競存的拔巧！記者綜合實地向地方父老訪問的結果，知道他們的作風，與普通土匪確有截然不同之點：譬如說薛永輝，他自稱是共方太湖軍區挺進軍司令，抗戰時期即以蘇細第三區光復的西華半島爲根據地。有二三十個小嘍囉，他們都抱定了「兎子不吃家邊草」的宗旨，儘管在遠處殺人放火，打家劫舍，而對盤踞據點的西華半島居民，却是秋毫無犯。因此，當地的人民意識，就根本沒有認爲他們是一羣強盜，所供應的田畝捐之類的攤派，在老百姓們心中，頗以爲終究是避免不了的一筆經常負担，積久了也就不以其爲苛了。他們在愚農「兵匪不分」的錯誤認識之下，巧妙地獲到安全的保護作用，達到了他們競存的目的。今年十月間，淸剿武力曾把薛永輝驅逐出西華半島，成爲流浪湖濱，以船爲家的流竄能伍，可是據最近確息，薜部竟又潛入了西華半島的上郎巷村落安居下來了。他們有本領先淸剿部隊之來而去，然後接踵於淸剿部隊之退而歸！記者曾把這情勢的形成癥結，質諸指揮部方面的幹部，一致認爲假使能够展開宣傳的力量，把正邪的判別深入民間，我們相信匪衆競存的技巧必然要喪失其作用。現在，太湖指揮部正準備從這一條路去着手，記者願向毛森少將呼籲，多給些指示與助力！</p>
<p>聆畢工作報吿，已經四時許了。</p>
<p>歸順部隊　在酷寒中生活</p>
<p>雨愈下愈大，天色也愈加陰沉。毛少將開始了歸順部隊一般狀况的視察，這是他專程來凟的最主要工作。集中在木凟的歸順部隊，共有二個暫編的獨立隊，還有一個獨立隊，則集中在善人橋訓練。我們首先到的地方，是獨立第三隊徐錦棠部的營苦。三十一名幹部，除留下一名充衛兵動務外，其餘都巳奉令集合在第一隊營舍中，聽候訓話去了。使記者感覺不勝驚詫的，乃是這麼酷寒的夭氣，他們的臥具，僅是二條軍毯和一方稻草織成的草褥，着地舖在一個廣廳的石磚上。毛少將對於這一個印象，也惻然悵惘，用手指估量一下軍毯的厚薄，連連表示必須立刻改善設備。至於担任衛兵勤務的士兵身上，更沒有制服，僅穿着短夾掛袴，戰慄地立在西風中，使人浮起抗戰時期，我游擊部隊艱苦作戰的回憶！第一隊的營舍在木凟下塘街的一個大礱稻場中，低矮的房舍巳近傾圯的程度，光綫黝黑得伸手不見五指。廖炳南部共有一百十六名，他們終算都有一襲舊軍服穿，但也單薄得很。倒是徐錦棠以下的卅名，雖沒有制服，可是棉袍，罩衫穿得頗整潔，似乎還暖和。一百四十餘名的草莽壯士，排列在斜風凄雨的露塲上，每個人的臉上都很嚴順，洋溢着棄邪歸正，迎受新生的喜悅！毛森少將看天空的雨點愈下愈大，一面命令負責督練的張和淸敎官，把隊伍改道集中距離不遠的城隍廟大殿，一面先作全營舍的巡視。所謂營舍，說也可憐得很，完全是黃泥砌牆，蘆蓆劃壁的一間間空閒的小米倉而已。士兵們的臥具連草褥也沒有，就只有二條軍毯，一襯一被。伙食總算三餐，一粥二飯，每名每天有廿四兩米，二百五十元的副食費。毛少將在巡視廚房時，還仔細察了一下鍋裏的飯和桶裏的菜，頗有飯還够而菜太少的感覺。</p>
<p>走進城隍廟，殘破的廊廡還留着當年木凟大火的　跡，天色已經薄暮了。壯士們肅候在剛造好不久的大殿上，於點點紅燭的微光輝映下，祇見黑黝黝的一羣，眞富有古廟嘯聚的意味！記者初以爲毛少將不過剴切致一番訓詞而已，那裏知道他會不厭瑣屑按照花各冊，一個個點名談話。首先被召的是第一隊隊附曾紀倫，（隊長廖炳南事假），短胖結實的身材，膚色很白哲，一點沒有我們想像中應有的粗　習氣。他坦直地說出了部下一致的痛苦，是晚上太冷，還希望增加些副食費。對按日敎育訓練的作息程序報吿，是早上六時起身，實施爬山，跑步，體操等健身運動。九時早餐後，整理內務，上講堂。下午的課程，則側重於學科的進修。實到聽訓的一百三十四名壯士的個別詢問，足足耗費了三個多小時，記者站在毛氏的身邊，側耳聽廣庭中滴滴不輟的簷水聲，心緒逐漸焦急。匆匆離開蘇州，沒有準備雨具，回頭跑返指揮部，勢必要變成落湯鷄了。</p>
<p>訓話完畢，幸喜簷雨聲已經停止；鄕村的陰雨夜特別黑暗，差不多近乎伸手不見五指的程度，依賴閃爍的電筒光，我們高一脚，低一脚，跟蹌跑回指揮部。感謝楊主任，特地給記者在招待所毛少將臥室的對門，騰出了一個房間休息。晚飯後，毛少將召集糾察隊員舉行個別談話，這一羣年靑的夥伴，由一個女性隊長張熈明率領，是太湖指揮部惟一的直屬武力。十一時許，副指揮官劉宏德上校，適自滬返蘇，聞訊當夜趕抵木凟。劉上校現在負着太湖淸剿的全責，是一個魁梧豪爽的年青軍人。記者與他匆匆一晤，　他忙着要晉見毛參謀長，沒有多談話。</p>
<p>太湖如舊　太帆船紛綏來</p>
<p>鄕村的一晚，睡得異常酣暢，早晨醒來，朝陽映在高牆上，天已經晴了。聽勤務說，毛參謀長直到侵晨五時纔休息，大早就起來，還巡視了厠所的淸潔。記者不禁由衷佩服他這種不眠不休心細如髮的精神。洗盥畢，心神已飛向廣闊的太湖。這灌溉三省的太湖，記者巳與它睽遼了好久，不知近况如何？想着不久就可再見，領略一望無際的景色，眞是興奮得很，誰知道剛吃完早餐，無鍚指揮所來了長途電話，江灣軍械庫大爆炸，湯恩伯將軍命令毛森遄赴上海調查，不得已，祇好打消深入太湖的計劃。可是，太湖雖沒有深入，我們仍然到了太湖的邊緣胥口，瞭望太湖的形勢，也算「慰情聊勝於無」！</p>
<p>太湖在朝陽裏，特別顯得靜美，遠處有數艘載重的大帆船，從天水相述的沿綫駛來，太湖的貨運終算沒有絕跡。我們限於時間不能多所流運，十二時卅分汽車把我們載回蘇州，毛參謀長仍奮趕上了下行的「錢塘號」。一個新的任務正加在他的肩上，我們緊緊握別。</p>
<h3>聖誕老公公</h3>
<p>本報資料室</p>
<p>聖誕節的到來，沒有人吿訴你也會知這的。</p>
<p>踱到馬路上，最先的印象是兩旁店舖的櫉窗顯然地與平時不同了。</p>
<p>長長短短，大大小小的樹窗內，差不多都站着個聖誕老公公，雖然面龐不盡相同，但總都是拖着長鬍子，穿着紅衣服，身上散着白白的棉花，揹上了一個大包裹。</p>
<p>聖誕老人揹了些什麼來呢？在糖果店裘他揹的是蛋糕與巧克力；在玩具店裏，他揹的是小火車·小輸船；在皮鞋店裏，他揹了一大袋的小皮鞋，在帽子店裏，揹上了一大疊紅紅綠綠的帽子。</p>
<p>聖誕老人的來歷，據說，開始是在歐洲北部極寒地帶，條頓民族有一個兒童神，名呌St．Nicholas，後來傳到美國去，稱作Santa　claus，我們中國就稱他爲聖誕老翁。相傳他生性和藹，特別喜歡兒童，在每年隆冬，必定辦了許多禮物，親自送給兒童們，尤其是對於貧苦的兒童，格外注意。其後基督敎因爲老人的行動，與基督愛人如己的精神相吻合，所以每年聖誕節就採用這一段故事，一方面使一般基督敎徒借此可以做些好事，一方面鼓勵兒童們向上，學那博受的精神。</p>
<p>這位聖誕老人的任務：便是揹上了這麼大的一個包裹，在聖誕日的淸晨，大家還沒有起身的時候，悄悄地從烟囪裏溜下來，把包裹裏的禮物塞在牀前掛的襪子裏面。</p>
<p>講到烟囪與襪子的起源，也很有趣，原來英國人老早就和我國歲暮除塵的風俗相似，在新年之前，必須將烟囪打掃乾淨，讓明年的好運道進來。不知怎一來，聖誕老人也就變了從烟囪裏下來了。掛襪子是英美人想出來的，起先荷蘭兒童是把鞋子放在爐邊，據說聖誕老人，必須看到鞋子子放正在那裏，才把禮物放在裏面。大槪英美的兒童更聰明，改用了襪子，因爲襪子可伸開，容量又大得多，儘可以多放些東西進去。</p>

<h3>血統溯源　中暹是一家</h3>
<p>— 徐松石</p>
<p>暹羅國在公元第十三世紀中葉以前，即宿古台Sukotai王朝還未成立的時候，沒有正確國史。所以暹羅人對於自己祖先的來歷，大半茫無所知。</p>
<p>暹人祖宗　原是中國土著</p>
<p>近年以來幾位西方學者，經已肯定整個暹羅民族的祖先去自中國。這些學者當中最有名的一位，乃英國大學敎授賴哥博里Prof．T．deLacouperie。他說遠古時代的暹羅人起源於中國豫鄂皖交界的山地，有巢族即其部落。一支向西遷移，經陝蜀交界的九隴山折而向南，歷四川，貴州，雲南，而至撣邦和暹羅國。如今暹人喜住高脚木屋，還是一貫巢居的風氣。法國學者愛門納E.Aymonier指暹羅族發源於雲南和康藏。英國學者甘納F．Garnier則謂暹羅族發源於華南。</p>
<p>最大部族　號稱大泰小泰</p>
<p>作者年來，對於暹羅民族史深感興趣。根據個人研究所得，經已證明整個暹羅族都是廣義漢族的子孫，而漢族原本就是肇基於中國，並非西方移過來的。大的四千年前，暹羅族祖先住於我國江淮之南，與周初的荊舒同一部族，當然是廣義漢族的一個支派。後來所謂楚族，吳族，越族，閩族，粵族，顯然與暹羅族同一血統。</p>
<p>向來暹人自稱爲小泰人Lai　Nysi，而稱北部的佬族Laos爲大泰人Tai　Noi。這兩族人就是暹羅國最大的部族，語言風俗都是大同小異。此外還有撣族Shans，集中於暹羅國的西北部，也隸屬於大泰稱號之內。其實撣族的祖先，乃周秦時嶺南的烏滸人，自嶺南遷去最早。的在公曆紀無前五百年間，前鋒即已達到撒爾溫江流域。佬族的祖先乃西漢時貴州鎭南的西南夷，亦稱牂牁獠，（獠佬二字同音）。孟獲就是他們最有名的部長。自蜀漢以至唐朝，他們大批遷入暹羅境內。在唐宋時代，深受南理大理兩國的支配。元朝的羅斛國，就是這些佬人所建立的。</p>
<p>元朝暹國　查係赤眉遺種</p>
<p>至於元朝的暹國，根據『續文獻通考』，謂乃赤眉遺種。作者經已切實證明赤眉乃是景美的異譯音。建立這暹國的，乃那號稱小泰人的暹族。元至正間，暹與羅斛二國合而爲一，直至今日。暹羅得名，就是這個緣故。這退族與佬族撣族略有不同。因爲暹族的祖先乃於唐朝宋朝始直接去自廣東欽州的北部和廣西的西南部，即古稱西原廣源和黃峒等地方。而且我們有許多理由，相信最初握暹國政柄的，乃是宋朝狄靑所敗大南王農智高部下的後人。這些暹人，乃令日暹羅國暹佬撣三犬族當中最請敏和最有勢力的一部分。他們與漢族的關係，可謂更爲密切。</p>
<p>黎人獞人　與暹人同血統</p>
<p>今日廣東海南島的黎人，無疑地與暹羅人同一系統。今日廣西西部和北部的僮人，（前作獞，音讀如撞），就根本與暹人完全相同。貴州的　家和雲南的僰夷，也與暹人同一族類。作者隨便取暹語一百二十個　用字，與僮語加以比對，其中不甚相同的只有十三個而巳。　寗，百色，龍州等地，僮人有收音機的，可以收聽暹京盤谷的播音，完全沒有隔閡。退人鄕村的名稱，以及生活習尙等，與桂省四百餘萬的僮人可謂全然同一型式，這眞是一件異常有趣的事。須知僮人乃我國西南邊區優秀的部族。名將如石達開，韋昌輝等，都是僮人。而且古代所謂百粵人，就是僮種。目前廣東語還存有許多僮語和暹語的音素。呼地栗爲馬蹄，呼柚子爲卜六，呼年糕爲大龍糕，就完全是暹僮言語。廣東順德大良二字即暹語黃族地義。倘若我們說荊蠻楚吳越閩粵黎僮等古部族爲漢族，就絕對不能不承認暹羅族是古代漢族的子孫。</p>
<p>單音語言　與漢語極近似</p>
<p>選羅人以前有語言而無文字。元朝末年，始採印度巴利字母，拼出暹羅語音。如今暹羅語仍是單音語，並有平上去入等聲。有許多字音與漢語字音相同。呼二爲雙，呼食爲哽，呼天爲旻，呼酒爲醪，呼死爲歹，呼屋爲欄，這些字音允近中國古意。暹語與漢語相關如此密切，我們只可視他爲漢語的一種方言而已。無疑地，暹羅同胞是出於我們漢族血統的。</p>
<p>最近暹羅元老乃比里曾經來華參觀，報載暹羅大使乃沙浣杜拉叨，不日要在南京呈遞國書。我們希望這兩位「乃」，（乃字在暹語即漢語的君字或先生二字），眞能認識中暹是一家人，眞能明瞭中退的歷史，而於兩國的關係上作更熱切的推進！</p>

<h3>外交的今昔</h3>
<p>— 韻自紐約時報</p>
<p>好戲翻東出新　從前唱全武行　現在改變作風</p>
<p>時間大的經過一世紀的四分之一那麼長，自從一九一九年在凡爾，　宮開的和會一直到今天在維拉辛草地舉行的會議，我們坐在漫畫家們用筆畫成的包廂裏，看到了國際間外交上的演出。這是一種時時翻陳出新的連台好戲：外交人物和他們所應用的方法，所穿的行頭和演出的戲文，舞台的氛圍和情節的長短，一切都已經有所改變。</p>
<p>常然也有些歷久不變遺留下來的傳統，例如在這次大戰以後使會場生色不少的責罵和交鬨，則確實爲尋求和平不折不扣的古典派作風。每當一次戰爭平息以後，外交家們好像把在家中的敲凳擊桌，當作與敵國議和的必要手段。事實上有的時候他們還要做得更過分一點。</p>
<p>在第一次世界火戰以後的凡爾賽宮裏，英國首相勞合喬治一時肝火上升，怒衝腦門，覺得非要拉住法國總理克利孟梭的大禮服領口，要他對於本人所加侮辱予以道歉不可。一九二二年洛桑會議的時候，土耳其代表惱啊博士把自己的貴體一躍而過舖着綠呢的桌面，扼住希臘首相煩　纔落死先生的咽喉，一直等到道位首相臉上現出靑色，方纔鬆手。</p>
<p>以世人所知的消息爲限，這次大戰以後在倫敦，巴黎，舊金山或者紐約開的會議裏尙釆有類似情形發生。新派的作風已經不再是那樣了，用以替代的是口頭攻擊，皮肉上的毆打已不再被用到。</p>
<p>禮服已成過去</p>
<p>由於外交人物的本身巳經有了上述的變更，他們所穿的衣服自然也就跟着不同。二十五年以前，當我們踏進第一次和平曾議會場的時候，即以我們只不過是勞觀的人而論，也得穿上長條紋的褲子，黑色的晨禮服；頭上戴着黑的漢堡帽，威儀十足。大家似乎感覺到每一個沾到一點外交氣味的人都要和從事於此的外交家們一般，打扮得整整齊齊纔對。但是今日這種愛德華式的外套已經變成了外交古董的象徵了。年靑的政治家們都羞於再碰它，他們愛穿着不拘形式的上衣和褲子討論世界大事。這次聯合國大會在紐約開幕的時候，類似</p>
<p>一九一九年的外交是全武行勞合喬治肝火上升，拉住克利門梭的領口覺得非要他對本人所加侮辱予以道歉不可。</p>
<p>一九四六年的外交是親吻式的作風貝文興莫洛托夫已不再利用皮肉上的毆打而代以口頭的攻擊。於舊形式的只有一項規定：就是要穿正派的深色上衣，但已經不再一定要穿晨禮服，並且此一要求的對象還是通譯人員，並不是代表們本身。</p>
<p>關於外交語言也有了變更。在十八世紀的全部和十九世紀的一部只有一種外交用語：是爲法文，職業的外交家是被要求着用法語接洽事務的。但是在凡爾賽會裏有兩個大亨威爾遜和勞合喬治對法文全然不懂，而法國老頭克利孟梭英語却講得非常流利。每當他高興道樣做的時候，這位老虎總理就馬上跳過外交慣例的藩籬，對他的同僚使用他語言粗糙的一面，說出三人都能立刻聽懂的英語來。</p>
<p>外交語言改變</p>
<p>今日把一麥格風」放上會議桌，更使外交語言起了絕大的改變。有時一個代表所說的話就和　給他本國人聽的一樣，他就是這樣說着而希望會場裏的人都能聽懂。此事另外還有一個原因，每一個代表在認爲他的太國語言，決不亞於任何另一國的前題底下，爲　國家的威望，也希望能爽利地用本國語言。雖然這個要求不能够無限制地達到滿足，聯合今日巳經有了中·法·英·西·俄五種官方用語國家爭得威望，五百個人同時白費時間。</p>
<p>最後還有一個變革要提一提，就是今日外交界在舟車的行駛和宴會的坐席上是仍舊有着長幼尊卑的次序存在的，不過外交家們在行動上所表現的却正是本身所佔重要性的反面。職司愈高的人所做工作愈苦。只有每當宴曾以後，離開酒席　回到工作室的次序倒是依着地位的高下排列的：最先是外交部長，其次是大使，再其次是全權公使。代辦帮辦們限看着這些人全部走完以後方纔懶洋洋地跟着回到文卷堆和會議席裏去。</p>
<p>今日外交確實已經成爲一種比以前更加煩重的工作了。</p>
<p>時事評述</p>
<h3>世局重心移遠東　白人開發亞洲已成過去</h3>
<p>— 儲玉坤</p>
<p>自從四國外長會議和聯合國大會相繼閉幕之後，一九四六年終算獲得了一個平靜的歸趨；各國政治外交家一年來的努力，並沒有徒勞無功，而這兩個國際會議的成就，實在是歷次國際會議鮮有的成功。所以各國政治外交家返到本國之後，紛紛發表談話，稱道四國外長會議與聯合國大會的重大成就。大家對於世界政局今後的發展，都寄托在一九四七年的希望。第一明年二月廿日，對義·羅·匈·保·芬五國和的，就可在巴黎簽字成立，這五個納粹德國的附庸，也就可以恢復常態，成爲聯合國機構的會員國；第二明年三月廿日，四國外長又將在莫斯科舉行會議，討論對德奧和的。世界一步步走向和平，的確令人樂觀，而認爲世界的前途，將有無限的希望。</p>
<p>時局好轉　遠東怎樣</p>
<p>世界的大局，旣已好　，由列強合作，共同締造世界和平，並不是不可能的事情，於是遠東局勢也有隨着世界好轉而開朗的希望。但是在眼前的遠東，確是世界最糟糕的一環，例如中國雖然是五强之一，但因國共問題的不能解決，以致全國籠罩在內戰的烽火內。再如印度尼西亞·越南·緬甸，都醞釀着獨立運動，天天在那裏流血，尤以越南爲最烈，幾令整個維明共和國，完全在動亂中。而法國政府當局對此，不但處置欠當，而且至今還沒有放棄其過去對於殖民地的作風。因此使越南問題更難解決了。越南已籲請中美出而調處，法國社會黨內閣如果不能作豎明的決定，即使中美調處，也是無益的。我們要吿訴法國，白人開發亞洲的時代已經過去了。誠如紐約民聲講壇報所載稱。</p>
<p>美国重申　對華政策</p>
<p>最近半年美國國內要求政府當局重行考慮對華政策，而且中國國內也頗爲誤解美國政策的地方。因此社魯門總統重言聲明對華政策，實在是非常必要的。杜魯門總統終於在本月十八日發表長篇演說，重言聲明，美國對華政策不變，去年十二月十五日所發表的對華政策，繼續有效；並鄭重聲明下列各項。</p>
<p>（一）美軍駐留中國，係應國民政府之請，協助中國遺送日僑日俘返國，以及恢復中國國內和平與秩序，美軍人數已自十一萬三千人减至一萬二千人。（二）承認中國爲自主獨立國家，並承認國民政府爲中國唯一的合法政府；（三）美</p>
<h3>女人的世界</h3>
<p>現在的世界是屬於男人的嗎？對於這個問題，我們的答案是「不」。以世界上最進步的國家美國爲例，根據該國商務部的統計，女人用掉　國薪水階級血汗錢的百分之八十五。聯邦户口調查局宣佈美國女人的平均壽命並且要比男人長四年。</p>
<p>加利福尼亞州聖喬斯城州立大學校醫室負责　格檢查的護士，對於學生受各種預防疫苗和治療血淸注射時所起的反應作了一個記錄，證明看見針腿發軟的男人要比女人多百分之四十五。</p>
<p>美國公共衛生局調查了肺炎病發生的次數以後。報吿說該病患者中有百分之五十五是男人。大都會入壽保險公司的書記們透露患闌尾炎開刀的男人也比女人爲多，美國醫學會並且吿訴我們說有比女人多出不少的男人動脈發生硬化。</p>
<p>麻薩諸塞州南橋城美國光學公司將美國人患色盲症的情形加以研究，發現國內百分之九十的色盲患者是男人。</p>
<p>洛杉機城水上防護官分析了十年間海灘上救起的二千八百條人命，驚悉出事的男性游泳者佔全數百分之七十。</p>
<p>西拉寇司大學有一敎授統計美國人中有百分之一患口吃，而患口吃者中男人的占百分之七十五。</p>
<p>就是神明也軍門找男人麻煩，倫敦有一個專門從事意外事件統計的保險公司職員，發覺遭天雷打死的人之中也有百分之八十七是男人。</p>
<h3>小知識</h3>
<p>— 吳鵬鳴</p>
<p>美國商務部最近報吿了一樁有趣的事實，在大戰中運往海外的步兵曾經使用過兩種藥丸防止暈船，一種包含有效成分「海屋醒」，另一種却僅含作爲心理醫療的白糖而已。在風浪不大的海上吃過白糖仍舊暈船的人佔百分之二十，的比吃過「海屋醒」再暈船的人多八倍。在風浪險惡的海上，這兩種的量船情形却幾乎沒有什麼分別。</p>
<h3>聖誕節妙在：　爲何神秘？</h3>
<p>— 韻蓓譯自考芬著「聖誕節在梅茵」</p>
<p>每人都在同一時間　做著一無二致的事</p>
<p>從聖誕節的習俗來看西方民族的特性，實在最爲相宜。因爲這是一個賅括起來包含三種性質的節日：第一，它含有濃重的宗敎意味；第二，它是屬於家庭和兒童的歡樂；第三，它是每一個人一年一度的饕餮藉口，爲着本刊本週發刊適當今年聖誕節，謹選譯描寫佳節的文字一段如　；</p>
<p>「假使你也想過一個快樂的聖誕節，像我小時候有一回在天堂晨塲度過的那一個一樣，……你就必須要有一個澄澈的十二月夜晚，梅茵州的藍星閃爍得像藍寳石，圍橈着光芒灑滿大地的月亮。在這時候，再把堆積着假雪的樹枝上的燈都點好，它們就好像敲碎了的金剛鑽似地點點發光。……你也可以讓這一間晨舍的房子裏擺滿了桃金孃樹，上面掛上一簇一簇的藍色珠寳，……或者把薔薇花的果實掛在松針上。葛　子果實層層堆積，甜餅也已經放在適當的地方。</p>
<p>此外在你身旁最好還得有一個姑母。她相信著草茶和聖經是兩樣爲孩子好必需預備的東西她於是打開聖經來把基督降生的故事高聲地念給全家人聽。當然聖誕樹更是不可缺少的東西，這棵樹要有足够的高度，使它的枝椏都能沿着起坐室的天花板　轉，呈現出像一把古老的扇子張開着的形狀。你可以一直等到當天的早晨，纔把它用雪撬裝回家來。</p>
<p>姑叔伯都在家裏，堂表兄弟姊妹們數目更多了，眞是所謂車載斗量。這時候你的全民族都在家裏玩玩這玩玩那樣。最美滿的聖誕節的要素是每人都在同一時間做着一無二致的事情。</p>

<p>這　屋的特色，便是全部用鋁和鎂等輕金屬”成，使他的重量比通常的「卡車」來得輕；但用飛機用的齒輪控制的兩輪，使他能載得起更多的重量具有電熟的熱水箱，作雨淋浴的「運蓬頭」，最實用的梳妝台，柔和的螢光燈，一副不燒汕或酒精，而用瓶裝「氣」的爐灶，也是牠的特色。　持久不脫的油漆，可以省去室內裝飾，並且得到淸潔工作的便利。</p>
<p>也有的設計者，更在裏面配進一座「供應室」，供給全「屋」的　燃，電熱的用電，使他在離開輪電綫時，自給自足‘，</p>
<p>有電氣冰箱，也有普通冰箱，備　　儲物品，並有適　地方，給你作冰塊的儲藏，在缺電時，使你得到充分的便利。</p>
<p>這使是一座流動「家」的「性能」；他的設計起源，還遠在十年以前，爲了旅行者們要把食和住，一起帶上旅行之路，才開始設計製造，戰事發生雖停止了人們可　的　　，　「流動車屋」的　行仍未停止，在設計上更有特別的進步。因爲「房屋問題」需要牠！許多進行公家或建築工程的地方，也常有許多這種「村落」存在着，一個鄉區警士也需要牠一同下鄉去，城市醫院更需要牠帶着病人去旅行。　戰時，這種「車屋」，還是房板木等木質材料和鋼骨架的合製品，通常有九呎闊，的二十二呎長，重量在二千八百磅上下。</p>
<p>標準的設計，便是把起坐室放在前面，臥室放在後面，在中間插入一個有着水槽湘斗，杯牒廚，烹飪爐于和冰　聯　水電供　設備的　房。</p>
<p>有二個「大門」，許多窗子；窗子可推出或向上移，因在上面裝有絞　，撑出即成一「天幕」，可阻去飄入的雨。</p>

<p>另一種「車屋」，完全像「村舍」，外觀長二十五呎，有白漆的周圍，活動的百葉窗和瀝靑與屋板合做的頂。通氣設備裝在「天花板間」從屋頂排氣。</p>
<p>根據你所需要的大小和條件，使用的年代，你能購得適當的一輛，所費從美金數百元到數千元不定，你也可費一萬五千元買得最富麗的「陸上遊船」。最小的你可買到僅長十呎的「車屋」，在那要臥室，起坐室和廚房就祇能併在一起了，廚房用具佔的是該車後部，可以開起來隱藏去；如果用作短旅行，露宿用，仍有一切大流動車屋的優點。</p>
<p>最近美國政府將出售戰時應用的車屋，價目是一千元左右，雖然有些車子稍舊，但　畢竟是個便宜的價格；這些「車屋」在車中大都是作爲修理部的，修理兵士們的衣服，鞋襪，車胎，以至軍器，也有作爲營房。</p>
<p>爲了增加該屋的載重，在前面又裝二，個小　；使車子有三點支撑，過載彈簧，使在快速進行時，免除搖曳和　跳。但使製造工作較爲複雜。</p>
<p>現在，設計者的意向，都集中在如何减輕「車」重量的一半，而對於裏面的設備完全不减少；將放棄用房屋建築方法，應用各種製造飛機的方法，利用飛機的剩餘物資如「玻璃」疊片，輕金屬板等取代舊用建築材料。</p>
<p>「流動車屋」除了供給旅行者作爲「理想的家」外；一個電影公司用牠組成電影服務社；圖書館也搬進「車屋」去流動起來；官吏們在鄕區也可以得到　公處；警察局更可以把他做槍械站，動警局。一個學校的實騐室，也可以便利地拖來拖去爲學校服務了。</p>
<p>看吧，不要再等多少時間，那些適合你意思和需要的各式「車屋」，並且可以和現在每年換取新式汽車一樣，時常換一個更新式的。</p>
<p>牠將要活躍地以每小時六十哩的速度，開到山　，海濱　林去；駛行在廣闊的大　上，停留在特說的「車　站」裏。</p>

<h3>雲南起義的實際策動者</h3>
<p>— 陸丹林</p>
<p>護國之役，雲南起義，討伐袁世凱叛國。他的主動力究竟屬於那方面，三十一年來，還沒有一個正確的判斷。他的史實，都給社會的人們一個混亂的疑問。如康有爲說：「雲南起義，我命梁啟超幹的。」梁啟超却說：「雲南起義，是我命蔡鍔幹的！」且梁啟超的著作，如「鼻盾集」，「躬　談」等，都是鋪張揚厲他自己和進步黨的功績。自然，這是政治上的作用，也是政客的手段。然而有些人竟也給他們朦蔽了。甚至中小學的教科書，也是只是標榜蔡鍔的功績，抹煞了中華革命黨（同盟會以至國民黨）的主動。是丹非素，顛倒黑白，這在黨史上護國史上，近代史上，都該有明白的辯明，來給我們研究民國政治史的一個正確的視聽。</p>
<p>進步黨的主幹是梁啟超，梁啟超與康有爲都是保皇黨的要角。國父在建國方略心理建設第八章內有說：「其時有保皇黨發生，爲虎作倀，其反對革命，反對共和，比之清廷爲尤甚。」梁啟超們與革命黨勢同水火的不相容是事實，進步黨効忠袁世凱排擠革命黨。在民國初年，也有顯著的事實。等到袁氏盜國，梁啟超反對帝制，表面上，是梁的聰明處，其中內幕是帶有政治關係，但是梁旣反袁，國人對梁自當有相當的欽佩。因爲護國討袁，絕不是革命黨人包辦。但絕不能一手遮掩天下人的耳目，貪天之功，而爲一己一系的標　。</p>
<p>二次革命前後，國民黨員遭受袁世凱的驅逐·逮捕·殺戮的很多。革命同志除了一部分亡命海外或潛伏內地運動之外，有一部分是別有見解，中途分流。又有一部分利用雲南交通不便，袁的實際勢力所不到，唐繼堯別有抱負，善爲招待，或任文職，或參加內幕，或在講武堂任教官，或受軍事訓練，革命精神，在滇南異常團結，準備萬一。民國四月八日，　安會發生，袁世凱盜國陰謀，更加暴露。那時國父旅居東京，親自維持中華革命黨工作，洞悉袁氏背叛民國，應即策動各地討伐，特派居正赴山東，朱執信返廣東，陳其美赴上海，于右任陝西，呂志伊返雲南，從事規劃活動討袁；居等奉命，各有所布置。呂由日回滇，秘密運動。纔到昆明，巡按使任可澄即接北京統率辦事處電，令拘呂入警察廳。呂通信給鄧泰中·楊秦兩同志求援，鄧楊到警廳引呂往見唐繼堯，唐請呂住在鄧泰中家，因此得和　國藩·李植生·　鴻勲等時相往來，又和高級將領羅佩金·黃毓成·張開儒·葉荃等密商，決定四項辦法，一·唐繼堯如反對帝制，則仍推其爲領袖。二·如唐中立，則以禮送其出境。三·如唐附和帝制，則殺之。四·如實行二三兩類，則擁羅佩金爲領袖。鄧楊也趁機探詢唐的真實態度。唐表示如此大事，須由多數取決。這時恰值袁派專使江何二人到滇，徵詢唐的意見，暗中實係監視。唐於是暗囑他的弟繼　召集團長以上軍官秘密會議。其初，大家不肯發表意見，後改用無記名投票法表决，結果全體一致反對帝制，即席議決三事：一·積極提倡部下愛國精神。二·整理武裝，準備作戰。三·嚴守秘密。這是第一次會議的，是民四九月十四的事。十月十七日，第二次秘密會議，決定事項有四：一，中部各省，有一省可望響應時，即起義。二，黔桂川三省中，有一省可望響應時，亦起義。三，海外華僑或黨接濟餉械，亦起義。四，如以上三項時機，均歸無效，則本省爲爭國民廉恥計，亦孤注一擲，宜告獨立。十一月三日，第三次會議，決定起義時作戰方略，推羅佩金擬定。大計決定後，唐是　着觀變，施用計謀，一方面向袁　與委蛇，討取餉械，補充部隊。一面暗派　嘉壽赴日購買軍械，劉雲峯赴江浙，吳　夫赴粵桂·李植生往四川，李匯賓赴貴州，楊秀靈赴湖南，呂志伊往南洋籌款並與黨部聯絡。這些分頭進行，都是由呂回滇後與唐等委商討袁辦法纔決定的。</p>
<p>在討袁計劃經過數度秘密會議，其中決定軍事計劃，軍隊即借託剿匪名義，向川邊移動。在軍隊調度開拔間，各方同志，熊克武·程潛·戴戡·王伯羣·方聲濤·李宗黃·　振鵬·殷承獻等先後到滇·李烈鈞·蔡鍔等也先後電告抵達香港海防，（梁啟超雖有約而沒有到）李蔡二人都是唐的土官同學至友，唐派　處率隊前往途中，分別迎護到昆明。當唐蔡會面之時，蔡對相迎各將領說：「真使我喜出望外，你們一切早已準備好了，而且對我如此優禮。」這又可見雲南事先籌劃的事實。</p>
<p>在民四的十二月二十三日，由昆明發出請袁世凱撤銷帝制的　電，是由唐繼堯任可澄二人具名的，照錄　電通告請全國共同勸告，是由唐繼堯·任可澄·蔡鍔·劉顯世·李烈鈞·戴戡具名，後來所有對各方的通電，是由唐·李·任·劉·戴的次序具名，無疑的，這是證明唐是領銜的人，絕非梁　進步黨所主動·起義後十多天，唐給梁啟超信內有云：「松坡（蔡鍔字）循若（戴戡字）到滇，具述尊旨，　用堅決。」我們細譯「　用堅決」四字，便知道雲南討袁，早有計劃，絕非是因蔡到後纔定的了。且蔡的到滇，是十二月十九日，二十一日唐召集會議，廿二夜由唐主盟，參加的歃血宣誓。看此，則更加知道事前經有長久縝密的布置，否則三四天的倉卒期間，怎能夠籌備得這樣大事的呢。</p>
<p>梁啟超雖然說雲南起義，由他指揮，是進步黨的功績，而非革命黨所策動，但是事實勝於狡獪投機取巧的宣傳。今將護國軍高級將士姓名列後，便知道護國軍編制和將領屬於國民黨籍的佔最大多數了。</p>
<p>我們看了上表四十五人，屬於同盟會國民黨籍（其實同盟會早已改組爲國民黨，那時又改爲中華革命黨，此是照其各人原來黨籍而說。）的，二十八人，無黨籍的二人，未詳的十三人，屬進步黨一人。事實勝於狡辯，護國之役雲南起義，究屬什麽人領導，什麽策動，而功績應該屬誰，事實顯然了。</p>
<p>而一般人之所以誤會是進步黨與梁啟超的主動，是因爲梁啟超發表的「異哉所謂團體問題者」一文，傾動一時。第二，蔡鍔是梁啟超的學生。第三，梁啟超在兩粵發表文電，又參與兩廣都司令部，軍務院兩個討伐帝制的機構。靠着文字的舖張，便能炫惑一部分人們的視聽。於是便造成習非成是的紀載，把中華革命黨事先策劃，嚴密布置，在實際行動的將領，也輕輕地抹殺。這是顛倒事實，抑人抬己的政客手段。然而許多人都已受他的欺騙了，這是不得不羅列事實來糾正的啊。</p>
<h3>龐左玉的花卉</h3>
<p>— 施翀鵬</p>
<p>我和吳興左玉女士，不相見已很久了，她能唱程派的青衣，她能寫蘭亭一類的王字，她能畫，更能詩，每逢書畫家敍談的場合中，指點着幾位女畫家，獨不見龐女士的芳蹤，有次我提出來一問：才知道她離開上海而到祁門去旅行。這樣有意無意之間地常常惦念她！昨天忽然在報紙上知道她舉行個展，於是我們久別重逢了。</p>
<p>她的儀態，依然和過去那樣青春，活潑，大方，而她底作品，畢竟是士別三日，括目相看了，在她百餘輻花島中，給我一個淳靜而恬淡的美感，旣沒有時下縱橫的面目，更沒有狂妄　悍的氣息，一派天真秀麗，剛健婀娜的風韻，耐人尋味。這一類的作風，我相信一定可以博得最多數人的欣賞和贊美的。</p>
<p>龐女士是永嘉鄉曼青的高足弟子，曼青担任教授多年，學生雖然很多，可是登堂入室，乃至於「青勝於藍」如左玉者，恐亦絕無而僅有吧？曼青花卉，我們所看到的大都是兼工帶潑，出入於青藤復堂之間的作品，而左玉竟然有超軼昆陵而窺挹劍南（趙昌）的趨勢，殊足注目！譬如：這次畫展中六條冊頁小軸，秀逸深雅，南田的神情，溢於楮筆，尤其彩色「菊花」，和我旬日前在倩庵家裏看見的南田，竟沒有絲毫軒輊，而另外一張「墨蘭」立軸，淡墨楚楚，風神瀟洒，簡直是青籘再現，恰和此「彩菊」有異曲同工的美妙。我想曼青對此可不興「我愧弗如」之嘆麼？題：「淡淡秋雲最耐寒，冷香高捧玉檀　，　英服食神仙事，莫作尋常晚節看」。真如斯人而有斯畫，斯畫而有斯詩矣。</p>
<p>扇冊小品中　秋·荷花·楓葉·牽牛·虞美人·紫籘·茶花·臘梅·竹雀·杜鵑等等淡妝濃抹，雙鈎與沒骨兼施，或者取法徐黃；或者規模趙易，（徐熙，黃荃，趙昌，易元吉）這些，在二十年前，海上盛行粗鹵塗抹，所謂海派畫的時期，也許有人發出「古人糟粕」的歪曲批評？其實；取法於上，僅得手中，書畫美術，應該精益求精，惟其工，乃能精，惟其精，乃能神乎其技，乃能精虛內蘊，動人美感。若然任意塗鴉，放浪不羈，荒誕怪暴，是藝苑中的野狐禪，精云烏哉？神云烏乎？美云鳴哉？我們該取道古人，師法自然，再從古人古法上，求其精進，有本有源，溫故知新，然後神與古會，心與神遊，達到登峰造極的境界。所以，我們品評龐女士的花卉，目前已在古人古法的階段上高速邁進，我相信她離開理想的「頂峯」，已不太遼遠。</p>
<h3>一寸山河一寸血　132</h3>
<p>— 葉勁風</p>
<p>〇十一却是高顧血統，頂着箭川金原的日本姓名。這時也有四十多歲，做着自由機械修理的行當；發明過滅聲手槍筒，只要把他這套筒加在任何手槍外壳上，放射起來，簡直聽不出槍聲。另外還有二十粒子彈匣，七巧鎖，等等。任何保險箱，他只要一根細鋼絲，一頭啣在口內，一頭通到保險鎖簧上，他有辦法可以把保險箱打開，並不費事。</p>
<p>這時安坂雞場裏，連鶴見·安坂·共是五人。鶴見一面細心審閱野豬帶來　子上午的情報，一面把他這晚探索「七封秘緘」的計劃，向四人說明。</p>
<p>他這計劃，共有四層行動；預定晚上九點鐘起，由〇十二率領部下的搏擊手到近衛別府四周哨探，等到正式動手的時候，就得担任引導，警報，牽掣外援，補助內　因失手而發生的搏鬥。</p>
<p>第二層由〇八號野豬領導，率領得力的幾名同志，襲進別府花園裏，担任警備·引導，和必要的搏擊工作。第三層由上野，箭川，和圓子担任；進行搜索工作；圓子引路，箭川應付各類電機上的困難，上野專任攝影；（除了精巧的燈光攝影機外，他還備有紅外綫暗室攝影器具。這是他從國外帶回的一件寶貝，器內裝有小型發電機，全副器具裝在一雙七吋長的皮匣內，預備不幸割斷電綫後的緊急應用。）</p>
<p>安坂記憶力最好，並且極其鎮靜，細心；所以由他担任這一次的行動總指揮，他算肩負着第四層　內一半工作。</p>
<p>鶴見把計劃說明之後，五個人又重新參詳討論研究了一番，改正了一些不十分分圓滿的步驟，大家覺得無懈可擊，這才由安坂正式就任，負起總指揮的職責來。</p>
<p>這時已是下午三點多鐘了，接過〇十二轉來的內綫情報，共有二次，一切情形良好，圓子把內應的工作，已經做到九分九了，只在等候正負兩種反應，隨時報告。　知衆人剛要分頭去　備各人職責方面，器具事工的當口，忽然來了一個特殊的電話，指明定要鶴見接談！</p>
<p>在普通人想來，也許要吃到一個小驚：「這是誰人打來的電話？」然而在鶴見和幾位同志心上，勝於晴空的走了一個　雷，把他們竟都驚得呆了。</p>
<p>說他們都驚得呆了，並非過甚之詞。照理，像鶴見和「〇」字頭的同志們，都是身心健全，神經穩定；在全世界警備密探組織名列第二的國家裏，和　　伸到的區域內，居然設下了十幾座秘密電台，也總算精明强幹，智勇卓絕的了，而且每個人大概也曾經過不少風險，何以這時，竟被一個電話驚住了？</p>
<p>這却另有一重關係，因爲鶴見隱在安坂，不僅他本人認爲極端秘密，連安坂這樣細心詳慮的人，也認爲十分妥當周密。旣是隱秘到了這種程度，居然有人發覺了，而且打了電話來，換句話，這百分之百的秘密，竟是洩露了，不是嗎？這樣，不說鶴見一般人，無論是誰，怕也免不了要驚得呆了。</p>
<p>「誰？」鶴見拿起電話筒這樣問。</p>
<p>「嗤！…」一個很熟的聲音，這們笑了。「誰嗎？…格格…東京除了我，再也沒有人知道你的蹤跡…大哥，你可以完全放心！」</p>
<p>「嗐！…」鶴見果然放了心，「你這點本領，真的呌人佩服…」</p>
<p>「大哥！」萍子剪斷了鶴見的話，「你佩服錯了」。</p>

<h3>通宵散步</h3>
<p>— 少夫</p>
<p>十年前的今日，蔣主席從西安脫險飛返南京，那時全國各地人民所表現的憐緒，眞是歡樂若狂。許多人喜極而淚，自動購買爆竹滿　燃放，感情上大泛濫，那是什麼，愛國心的出發，集中於擁護元首。</p>
<p>今日，我們回憶起來，仍不禁無限感奮。</p>
<p>也正是山於這情景，更令敵人惶恐，而加速爆發了侵略戰。</p>
<p>一個朋友來上海，帶了好幾百萬塊錢，未到三天用完了，臨行向我借了盤川費。他說：這個地方眞是花錢的地方，每一家商店的玻璃櫉窗似乎都向你伸出一條手來。打算來買的東西，一件沒有買，而並未打算買的，倒買了一大堆，它們便宜，又好又漂亮，不由你不掏荷包，結果祗好傾囊以赴，自己原來的計劃於是不得不打破了。</p>
<p>今夜各舞塲的營業時間仍照平日，午夜十二時爲止。</p>
<p>據說，各舞塲曾向當局請願，特別准許通宵營業，可是並未獲准。當局執法如山，這一種精神至値我們敬佩！</p>
<p>愛玩的朋友，對不住，請掃興一次！</p>
<p>假使有人準備帶了鈔票進舞塲，旣不能通宵在舞，我願意勸他今晚不妨逛逛馬路，馬路上恐怕有不少饑寒份子需要人送他們幾張鈔票哩！</p>
<h3>十</h3>
<p>— 馬葉</p>
<p>舉凡屬於基督耶穌名下的各宗各派宗敎，定必有十字架作爲標識，不過一個熟悉於宗敎派別的人會吿訴你：祇要看敎徒們如何應用十字架，和在十字架前舉行怎樣的議式，大體上就曉得那是屬於那一系的敎會了。</p>
<p>有人以爲十字架是天主敎或耶穌敎的神聖標識，這說法雖然不錯，但更吻合地來講，似乎應該把十字架認爲耶穌以身殉難，以身體罪的苦難的標記。我們在以「聖經」爲本事的電影中看過這些場面：耶穌是自己負着十字架步上橄欖山，而立即就被釘死在這個十字架上的。此外，我們也看到，好些中世耙以來的歷史名畫，畫着釘在架上的耶穌，或者右肩背着木架走向刑場的情景</p>
<p>假如照中國的風俗習慣來說，那情景就等於一個判死刑的囚犯，要他自己　一口棺材上刑場，或者，像日本「武士道」作風，强迫他自己先鋤挖一個地坑好來活埋！這是一個如何悲壯的鏡頭！</p>
<p>最初的宗敎畫或宗敎建築，這十字架上必定責上或塑上耶穌的全身體軀。其後才慢慢的省略而光是剩下一個十字架。</p>
<p>這架子的一橫一直的長短，也大有考究之處。最初其長度是按着人身長度和兩臂平展的長度做比例；後來呢，就變爲美術構圖學上一個重要的「律」，即所謂「黃金律」（Golden　Law）。律中這麼規定：凡是十字形或長方形的東西，其一長一短的比例，最美的必須如此：</p>
<p>短：長＝長：（短＋長）</p>
<p>這定律，至今仍爲學院派的美術家所承襲。</p>
<p>有人說：紅十字會的標識也是演變自基督的十字架。此外某種國際運動以「白十字」和「雙十字」爲標誌的則來自「紅十字」。</p>
<p>最後，筆者想說說東西洋「不謀而合」的這種有趣現象：中國的文盲在簽押文契時除了打指模以外，還握筆寫個「十」字作爲畫押。在西洋，也有相同的傳統老規矩。這十字　押，在英文中就呌做「基督十字」（Chrlst-cross）</p>
<h3>X＇mas</h3>
<p>— 慧</p>
<p>今天是聖誕節，筆者想說幾句應時話。</p>
<p>大家都曉得，今天這節日，在洋人寫來說來，都呌做「Christmas」，但一般人都簡略之爲「X'mas」，其實原字並不見得長，不過兩個音節吧了，爲什麼一定省去，而用「X」這字來代替呢？說來也有一番道理。</p>
<p>在英文裏「X」這個字母並不是個「好字母」，「X」的意思常常用以表示，「懷疑」，「未知」，「不可知」……等等。「X錢」的起因就是這種放射綫當時未能瞭解其本質，科學上之有「X素」「X體」……無一不是如此。</p>
<p>精確地說，X'mas開頭的「X」並不能算做英文，而是希臘文。照希臘文「基督」的簡寫，是摘取開頭這兩個字母「XP」，再簡略，就僅有「X」一個字母了。（按希臘文說：「X」的發音略如英文的「ch」，而「P」則相等於「ˇ」）英文X'mas的來源，亦即在此。</p>
<p>中文將它翻譯爲「聖誕節」似亦不很吻合。第一，「誕」與「節」即有點繁　；第二，「基督」即「基利斯督」之簡稱在原文中並不與「聖」字相等。</p>
<p>假如一定要我從新翻譯一個，那末，我以爲譯爲「基督誕」就很够了。「耶穌誕」似乎仍稍遜一點。</p>
<p>在海外華僑口中，常稱「十二月二十五日」這天做「洋人冬至」，因爲新歷每年十二月二十二日左右，即爲冬至也。</p>
<h3>聖誕老人的身價三萬五千元。</h3>
<p>— 俞創碩攝</p>
<h3>冬至當然外國好　葡萄美酒玻璃杯</h3>
<p>— 上官大夫</p>
<p>「冬至大於年」。這是我們家裏傳下來的一句老話，也是每年此日必須吃一頓豐富的晚餐的理由。這裏所說的冬至是中國冬至，至於「外國冬至」，那是進了高中以後的新節目。</p>
<p>說來奇怪，自從有了「外國冬至」以後，原有的中國冬至便從此淹沒不彩，每一個中國冬至都在不知不覺中過去，而每一個「外國冬至」却沒有一個不是狂歡的日子。</p>
<p>第一個把耶誕呌作「外國冬至」的人，必然是一個聰明絕頂的人。這名詞洋溢着異國情調，而又充分的迎合着國人的口味，結果是不肯把這一天輕輕放過。</p>
<p>紳士們準備了舞會，小姐們準備了新裝，餐室裏準備了聖誕大菜，戲院裏預備了特殊佳片、聖誕卡聖誕禮物在人羣中打轉。火鷄朱古力，大蛋糕，，香噴噴，甜蜜蜜，聖誕老人帶來的是愛情，幸福與歡笑。</p>
<p>而中國冬至呢？在我底記憶中，祇有暖鍋，祖母自己沒的玫瑰花酒，和她底帶了一絲酒意之後的滔滔不絕的故事。後來祖母去世，而我們這個家庭裏面，便再也沒有人記得那一天是冬至，雖則我還記得「冬至大於年」這句老話。</p>
<p>十年前的戰爭把我們驅到了香港。香港是異域，冬季的歡樂被「聖誕」所包辦了去整個維多里亞城被點綴得像一座聖誕老人的別墅，所有白種人都在這一天痛飲，高呼，歌唱，歡笑，通宵不眠。中國人則大別之，可以分爲兩種：下層的跟着他們在馬路上看熱鬧，紳士們在香港大酒店餐廳裏互祝「聖誕快樂」。</p>
<p>那天晚上，舞場達且通宵，汽車在馬路上，永遠不斷，巡捕閉着眼睛靠在電綫木上，像聖誕老人在打瞌睡。</p>
<p>太平洋戰爭把我從香港趕到了桂林，我所看見的「聖誕」，是屬於美國空軍與來自香港的小姐們的。中南路和中北路是小型的皇后道，酒，蛋糕，爆竹，罐裝火鷄，樂羣社，麗都，中央餐廳，坐滿了草綠軍裝的盟軍和奇裝異服的妖媚女人。冬至是外國的歡樂是國際的，這種歡樂的特色是廉價與普遍。</p>
<p>湘桂戰爭把我逼上了重慶，重慶也有「聖誕」。在拍賣行裏，在電影院門口，在放着大蛋糕的樹窗裏，到處都有聖誕老人的踪跡，在不是舞場的地板上蹁躍中法比瑞文化協會裏八音齊鳴，難民聽到了鐘聲，孤兒們拿到了禮品，有情人在這天成爲了夫婦。</p>

<p>— 又娟</p>
<p>今天聖誕，讓我講一個現實的故事給若干醫院老板們聽聽。這也可算是禮物：</p>
<p>晚上乘二路電車由外灘回家，窗戶都關着，也許因爲人多太悶的緣故吧，一個學生模樣的靑年忽然昏倒了，凑巧車中有一位外國醫生，他馬上打開皮包，拿出針管針藥等，很迅速的替那位昏倒的靑年注射了一針，該靑年便漸漸的醒了。他非常感激那位外國醫生，此時站在旁邊的一位中國人對醫生說：</p>
<p>「中國人的事要你外國人來費錢費力，實在不敢當。請問須要多少手續費，還是讓我來効勞吧！」</p>
<p>醫生回答說：</p>
<p>「我不需要錢，是我情願替他打針的，况且我的本意也並不是要錢。醫生的職務就是爲廣大的人羣服務，不分國絡也不分貧富，誰沒有博愛的精神誰就不配做醫生！」</p>
<p>他拒絕了別人的錢。</p>
<h3>千呼萬喚始出來　轉身又向黑市去</h3>

<p>配售處登報公佈門市部於二十一日開始營業後，令人喜出望外，而那醞釀已久爲衆人所愛的「毛毯姑娘」，也於當日在門市部「挺身而出」，和公敎人員正式見面了，不過身價比從前抬高了半倍，所幸尙未「利市三倍」，否則公敎人員　吃不消了，也就不能「一親芳澤」。</p>
<p>籌足了四萬五千元，帶着十二萬分歡愉的心情，置着大雪欲來的嚴寒，在二十一日公餘之暇的中午，跑到福州路第一門市部去，滿以爲此次一定可以和渴望已久的軟綿綿的羊毛毯見面了，　知跑到配售處去，看見的不是軟綿綿的毛毯，而是貼在玻璃門上的「今日羊毛毯八百條業已售完。」盆一冷水從頭上澆了下來，撲了一個空。推門進去，使看見無數張忿怒的面孔，不痛快地指責着。</p>
<p>找了一陣，問了好多的人，才找到「索取」配售登記表的地方，但是配給證却不能「索取」到手，非要機關的公函不可，可是報上並沒有如此規定。總算憑「三寸不　之舌」情商了一陣，才「通融辦理」地「賞」了一張配給登記表。我不知道他們爲什麼要如此一再爲難！</p>
<p>買不到毛毯，當然把目標轉移到四千三百元一條的　人床單上來，可是又碰了壁，說是「貨尙未到」，被他「漂亮」地拒絕了。</p>
<p>帶了一肚子的牢騷，從配售處回來，走進樊籠似的辦公室，坐在辦公臺上細細的思索，不覺疑心起來。</p>
<p>「八百條毛毯業已售完，」在一個上午就這樣「神速」地賣光了嗎？「索取」登記表還那樣地留難。</p>
<p>我們就以自早晨八時開始發售，至筆者到達配售處，（十二時）止，其間經過四個鐘點，在四小時以內售八百條，則售一條的手續所花的時間只有「十八秒」，請問在十八秒以內數完四萬五千元鈔票，和核對配購票之號碼印鑑，以及收款人的記賬等等手續，在這短促的時間內能够完成　？</p>
<p>從這側事實推論下來，我們可以得到下列幾個答案：</p>
<p>（一）每人不止限購一條。</p>
<p>（二）並未有八百條售出，已爲人大宗購去，流入黑市？</p>
<p>（三）爲何每日只售數百條，而不儘量出售，是否便利××，抑有其他作用？</p>

<h3>Living Allowance for Civil Servants, The Executive Yuan Plans to Adjust Standards, To be Submitted for Approval and Implementation Within This Month</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 24th] The Executive Yuan has decided to adjust the living allowance for civil servants and teachers starting from December.

Therefore, for the sake of special caution, it is carefully considering the recent price conditions in various places to properly draft the standards, but it can be submitted for approval and implementation no later than this month.</p>
<h3>Second Reading of the Draft Constitution Completed, Officials May Still be Elected as National Assembly Representatives, Disorderly Scenes at the 19th Session</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 24th] The 19th session of the National Assembly was held at 3:30 PM on the 24th. At the start of the meeting, 1,185 representatives were present, later increasing to 1,412. Chairman Wang Yunwu reported, and after the clerk read the minutes of the 18th meeting, the second reading work continued, starting from Chapter 14, "Implementation and Amendment of the Constitution," and Articles "146," "147," and "148" were passed without objection. For Article "149," "The interpretation of the Constitution shall be made by the Judicial Yuan," Ni Bi and 36 others proposed an amendment to change it to "The interpretation of the Constitution shall be made by a Constitution Interpretation Committee jointly formed by the Legislative, Judicial, and Control Yuan, with the President of the Judicial Yuan as the chairman." After Ni explained the reasons, Wang Zilan expressed opposition, saying that the power of constitutional interpretation in the United States belongs to the judicial organs, and no errors have ever occurred. He advocated maintaining the original proposal. After a vote, the amendment received 271 votes, but with 909 votes in the majority, the original proposal was maintained. For Article "150" regarding the amendment procedure of the constitution, there were two amendments: (1) Gu Yuxiu and 164 others proposed that the original text of the first paragraph of the article be changed to "It may be amended by the proposal of one-fifth of the total number of National Assembly representatives, the attendance of two-thirds (originally three-quarters), and the resolution of three-quarters (originally two-thirds) of the attending representatives," so as to conform to the legal number of constitution-making in Article 12 of the National Assembly Organization Law, so as to adapt to environmental needs and prevent the restrictions on amending the constitution from being too strict. After a vote, Gu et al.'s amendment was passed with 1,062 votes. (2) Su Zhi and 30 others requested that the word "正" (zheng, rectify) in the second paragraph of the article, "Legislative Yuan 'formulates draft constitutional amendments'," be changed to "改" (gai, amend). After a vote, it received 489 votes, but with 1,025 votes, the original text was maintained. For Article "151," "If it is necessary to separately stipulate the implementation procedures for the matters stipulated in this constitution, it shall be determined by law," there were two related amendments: (1) Xuan Xiao and 44 others requested that the review results of the Second Committee be maintained, and Article 152 be added, "The National Assembly that formulates the constitution shall be responsible for supervising and promoting the implementation of the constitution, and the term of office of its representatives shall terminate on the day when the group people's congress established in accordance with this constitution convenes." After the amended opinion was read out, Chairman Wang said that this opinion had been incorporated into the transitional provisions by the resolution of the Comprehensive Review Committee, and it seemed unnecessary to add it. He also asked Chen Cheng, the convener of the committee, to explain. The audience demanded an immediate vote. Wang shouted that this article was important and should be explained. After Chen's explanation, at the request of Duan Jianmin and others, it was put to a vote. As a result, 646 votes were in the minority, and the sound of "anti-voting" immediately rose, and order was declared disrupted. Chairman Wang shouted loudly: If the audience proposes anti-voting, it must be seconded by more than 50 people. Arms were lined up densely for a while, and anti-voting was immediately carried out. First, the Deputy Secretary-General explained the nature of anti-voting, but Lei's official language was not effective. Some representatives roared again: "I can't hear clearly, what are you saying?" "Change the Secretary-General!" and so on. The meeting place was in turmoil. As a result of the anti-voting, the amendment was still rejected. (2) Gu Yuxiu and 81 others requested that a clause be added to Article 151, "The preparatory procedures for the implementation of this constitution shall be determined by the National Assembly that formulates the constitution," as a transitional clause, "The preparatory procedures for the implementation of the constitution" have a legal basis. After Gu briefly explained it, it was put to a vote and passed smoothly with an absolute majority of 1,217 votes. The original text of the case was also passed without objection. At this point, the draft articles have all been read, and the discussion of several reconsideration cases began. The first to be proposed was the two reconsideration cases against the third clause added in the second reading of Article 28, "Incumbent officials may not be elected as representatives of the National Assembly"; (1) Hu Shi and 809 others requested that the clause be amended to "Incumbent officials may not be elected as representatives of the National Assembly in the electoral district where they are located" (2) Yan Guofu et al. requested that the clause be deleted and need not be explicitly listed in the constitution. After the two amendments were read out, there was a great deal of booing. The co-signer Chen Yunyu said that the provision deprived officials of their right to be elected, which violated the principle of universal suffrage and had the suspicion of sacrificing talent. Therefore, he advocated reconsideration and amendment. After Chen returned to his seat amidst the booing, Hu Shuhua again made a theory in favor of the amendment amidst the sound of "nonsense and random talk," but in the end, due to the chaotic order, everyone did not know what he was saying.</p>
<p>Then Ren Zhuoxuan spoke, opposing the amendment, believing that the provision was extremely reasonable, and stated five reasons: (1) The provision stipulates the negative qualifications of National Assembly representatives. If officials want to be elected as representatives, they can resign from their official positions first. (2) After the civil service system is established, administrative officials should compete for political officials. Official affairs are complex and important, and they should also fully implement policies instead of running for representatives. (3) One of the main tasks of the National Assembly is to elect the President and Vice President. If officials serve as representatives to engage in elections, they will inevitably take their own officialdom as their goal when making choices. Another task is to impeach the President and Vice President. How can subordinates impeach superiors? (4) Officials who also serve as National Assembly representatives combine party politics and two powers, violating the Founding Father's principle of dividing power and ability. Democracy means that everyone does things together. Those who are officials both receive salaries and also seize the position of representative, which is a minority of people specializing in fishing for profit and cannot be called democracy. He also emphasized: "Officials protect each other." Officials running for election in other places does not affect their exercise of power, but will only waste manpower and money. As a result, those who can truly represent the people cannot be elected, and the National Assembly will become a "Officials' Congress."</p>
<p>Yang Dopu continued to speak, saying: "Officials are officials, and people are people, and they should be separated." He cited the example of councilors in the Political Participation Council not being allowed to concurrently hold official positions and the established rules of Western countries, calling on the audience to consider carefully and maintain the original resolution. Several representatives further opposed the establishment of the amendment on the grounds that there was no provision in the rules of procedure for reconsideration of matters resolved in the second reading. Chairman Wang replied that what is not available in the rules of procedure can be submitted according to the provisions of the "Elementary Rights of the People." Reconsideration has been endorsed by more than half of the representatives, and it can be proposed. If it can be passed by two-thirds, it can also be established. After Yan Guofu explained his proposal to delete the article, it was put to a vote, and the deletion case was rejected with a minority of 629 votes. The amendment by Hu Shi et al. was passed with 921 votes. (The number of people present was 1,303.) Officials can still be elected as National Assembly representatives.</p>
<p>After a fifteen-minute break at 5:00 PM, the discussion of the reconsideration cases continued. The proposal by Ma Xuchang, Chen Shaoping, and others to restore the provisions of "amnesty" in Articles "41," "59," and "63" was passed with 745 votes. The proposal by Bao Mingshu and others to add the word "news" in Article "160" to protect the lives of journalists was still rejected with a minority of 543 votes. The temporary proposal by Zhang Zhijiang and others to add the word "sports" in Article "153" (originally Article "143")</p>
<p>At 5:35 PM, the discussion of the "Draft Preparatory Procedures for the Implementation of the Constitution" began. The clerk read out the full text, and after Sun Ke explained it, some representatives raised questions to correct two typographical errors in Articles 2 and 8, and believed that the phrase "the first National Assembly established in accordance with (this) Constitution" in each article was inappropriate, and advocated that it be deleted uniformly. Zhao Zimao advocated deleting Article 8, believing that when two-thirds of the total number of National Assembly representatives, legislators, and censors are elected, they can convene meetings or convocations, which deprives the powers of the remaining one-third. Chen Huanzhang and others again advocated that the various legislations stipulated in Article 2 of this procedure should be specified as being authorized by the National Assembly to the National Government, and the functions and powers of the Constitutional Implementation Promotion Committee in Article 9 should also be specified as being determined by the National Government by law. At 6:00 PM, after Chairman Wang obtained the consent of the audience, he extended the meeting by ten minutes and then began voting. Except for the word "first" on the National Assembly in each article, it was resolved to delete it uniformly with 902 votes, and the entire document was passed without objection according to the original draft. At 6:05 PM, Chairman Wang announced the end of the second reading session, and Deputy Secretary-General Lei reported that the meeting would continue on the 25th before adjourning.</p>

<h3>Soviet Restrictions on US Warships Leaving Dalian Cause Significant Repercussions in the US, Deemed to Violate the Spirit of the Sino-Soviet Treaty</h3>
<p>Democratic Senator Stuart Hua Calls for Thorough Investigation</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 23rd] The Soviet Union's expulsion of a US warship from Dalian on December 20 has become the most important international news in New York today. All afternoon newspapers carried it on the front page. The message from Dalian by the joint special correspondent of each newspaper, the liberal New York Post, was headlined; "The Soviet Union Has Driven the US Warship Out of China". The Hearst-owned newspaper was headlined: "The Soviet Union's Ultimatum to the US Warship Limits the US Warship to Leave Dalian Within Twenty Minutes". The conservative New York Sun headline: "The Soviet Army in Dalian Expelled the US Warship". The Howard-owned World Telegraph headline: "The Soviet Army Ordered the US Warship to Withdraw from Dalian". It also noted that the Dun was the Howard-owned newspaper's correspondent in China. The article stated: "The illegal actions of the Soviet army in Dalian are a threat to peace in Asia. China was originally recognized as having sovereignty in Dalian, but since the Soviet army entered, it immediately controlled the city and has since refused to return it to China. The Soviet army has established a regime here and controls the local police. We are accustomed to hearing that the Soviet Union is covering up the world with a curtain. The communist people and the garter belt rumors published by American tourists here claim that the United States has a large number of army and navy stationed in China, and loudly called out, pointing to sell it to threaten the general peace of the world, especially the Soviet-US relations; but these Moscow "fifth column" have never mentioned the Soviet Union's high pressure and illegal actions in Dalian. We have never violated the sovereignty of the country in any city in China, and any city where our army is stationed has never refused Soviet citizens the right to enter. Our country has only a small number of troops in Wuhu and fully recognizes China's sovereignty, while the Soviet Union's control of Dalian is completely contrary to this situation, which is extremely contrary to the spirit of the Soviet-Soviet Friendship Treaty. So who is the real threat to peace in the East? Is it the United States? Or the Soviet Union?"</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 24th] Democratic Senator Stuart Hua today called for a thorough investigation of the Soviet authorities' verbal notice ordering a non-armed US naval vessel to leave Dalian within twenty minutes, saying that this matter should be thoroughly investigated. I don't know what the State Department and the Navy will say about it, and I am very interested in it. The State Department is quietly waiting for the official report from Peng Ninghoff, the US Consul General in Dalian, and is maintaining silence. According to a spokesman, if there is no report in a few days, he will be asked to submit it quickly.</p>
<h3>Ambassador Will Meet Ye Jianying, Attends Yenching University Alumni Reception Today</h3>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 24th] The reason for Ambassador Stuart Leiden's visit to the North remains a mystery. General observations suggest that it may be to observe the situation in the North for mediation purposes. News from Yenching University: The Ambassador will visit the three members of the Military Mediation Department this morning, but there was no trace of the Ambassador at Xiehe Hospital today. Fu Jingbo said: The Ambassador did not go out all day today, but news from Yenching University said that the Ambassador arrived long after the candlelight worship scheduled for 4:00 PM this afternoon. Ye Jianying contacted yesterday to arrange a meeting time, which may be in the next few days. Sun Lianzhong, who suddenly returned to Ping from Baoding yesterday, attended General Gillen's banquet last night, and Li Zongren was also invited. It is rumored that the Ambassador may also have been present, but this has not been confirmed. This morning, Sun Lianzhong visited Fu Jingbo. Hints of this show that the Ambassador's visit to the North is not simple. The Ambassador will attend the Yenching University alumni reception tomorrow. The Ambassador's Christmas gift to his Yenching University students was 400 catties of rice and 400 catties of pork. It is rumored here that the Ambassador will cancel his trip to Tianjin on the sixth day and return directly to Nanjing, but Fu Jingbo did not confirm this news tonight, and said that the Ambassador's trip was because there were many matters to be heard from Northern American businessmen and people after the promulgation of the Sino-American Commercial Treaty.</p>
<h3>Ambassador's Christmas Remarks</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 24th] Before going to Beiping for Christmas, US Ambassador to China Dr. Stuart Leiden published his Christmas remarks in the Central Daily News yesterday. The full text is as follows:</p>
<p>The exact day of Jesus Christ's birth is probably impossible to determine forever. The earliest churches, relying only on that pious intuition, chose the Roman winter solstice festival without hesitation to celebrate this most meaningful historical event. Because before the winter solstice, the white day gradually shortens and the black night gradually lengthens. Once it reaches the winter solstice, the situation reverses and the time of illumination increases with each passing day, which is the prelude to spring coming to the human world and the earth turning green. Assuming that Jesus was born on this day, it may be explained as bringing spiritual encouragement and hope to the declining Roman Empire at that time. When the good news of Jesus' birth spread among the savage tribes of Northern Europe, they naturally followed suit and passed down the custom of collectively surrounding evergreen trees every Christmas. The reason why they did this was that they saw the day constantly shortening and feared that the sun would completely disappear into the long night. Therefore, they were willing to accompany the sun and perish in the severe cold. So they held on tightly to the only symbol of hope they knew - the evergreen tree, and used the newly discovered faith and joyful expression to set it off. In this way, for more than a thousand years, the customs of Christmas have been added to and beautified by all the ethnic groups in the world. These vivid traditional customs of ancient folk and all the beautiful embellishments that we use to celebrate Christmas today have great significance for the spiritual sincerity hidden beneath these things.</p>
<p>"Peace on Earth, goodwill to men" is a well-known saying in the world of Jesus today, but when Judah was ruled by Rome and suffered from the autocratic oppression of imperialism, a conquered country was filled with the spirit of resistance. This saying seemed to have no hope of being fulfilled for them. Since then, in human history, human prospects have been looked forward to several times, but they always seem dim and without light. Today, we are once again celebrating the Christmas season of 1948, and the world situation seems to remain unchanged. However, if we look at this world with historical eyes, we can easily know that the world has made great progress since then. With the hope aroused by this festival, we can calmly and steadily look forward to a broader and more lasting peace, and hope to obtain an increasing "joy" in the world through cultural exchange and other methods of seeking international understanding. This "joy" should be entrusted to the more sublime ideals and more sacred purposes of countless people in all countries of the world, who unite and resolutely work to build a more perfect world. When we dedicate ourselves to this sacred work in the spirit of Christmas, we will undoubtedly be able to exchange it for the joy of the New Year.</p>
<h3>Zhang Dongsun Flies to Shanghai Today to Attend the Democratic League Meeting</h3>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 24th] Zhang Dongsun is scheduled to fly to Shanghai at 10:00 AM on the 25th to attend the Central Executive Committee and Central Standing Committee of the Democratic League. Zhang's trip was extremely secret. When he met with reporters on the 23rd, he still refused to admit it. It is reported that Zhang received a confidential telegram from the Secretary of the Democratic League on the 22nd and immediately decided to participate in the meeting in Shanghai. Even on the eve of his departure from Ping, Zhang still did not express whether he would withdraw from the China Democratic Socialist Party.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, This City News] The Central Standing Committee of the Democratic League continued to hold a symposium at Zhang Lan's residence at 2:00 PM on the 24th.

<h3>The Hong Kong Government Exerts Pressure, Attempting to Calm Public Anger</h3>
<p>[Our Guangzhou Dispatch, 24th] According to Hong Kong news: Since the Zhang Tianxiang case and then the Wang Shuixiang case, our people have been extremely angry. The Hong Kong government is trying to quell this wave of anger by high-handed means. Recently, it issued warnings to Zeng Fuchu, the person in charge of the Fellow Villagers Relief Association in Hong Kong, and Chen Jianbo, the chairman of the Relief Chamber of Commerce, ordering them not to instigate assistance to the Zhang case, and the Chinese Civil Affairs Secretary summoned the two to court for interrogation and intimidation. Zeng and Chen are now planning to come to Guangzhou to appeal to all walks of life again.</p>
<h3>Zhang Qi-yun's Speech: "National Reconstruction Plan"</h3>
<p>Recognizing Nanjing as a Hub for Land, Sea, and Air Transportation</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 24th] Jinling University held a memorial week on the 23rd, inviting National Assembly Representative and scholar Professor Zhang Qi-yun to give a speech entitled "National Reconstruction Plan." From a geographical perspective, he explained the book "The Fundamentals of National Reconstruction" by Sun Yat-sen, stating that Dr. Sun's greatest contribution was to determine the main lines and key points of national reconstruction, with clear and insightful analysis. Finally, he pointed out Nanjing's position in the National Reconstruction Plan, stating that the eastern major port under the Central Railway, with the Tacheng Line being the longest railway line in the country, divides the country into two parts. Starting from Hangzhou Bay in the east and ending at the northern route of the Tianshan Mountains in the west, it connects the major cities of Nanjing, Xi'an, and Lanzhou, making it the first major line of national reconstruction, also known as the Central Avenue. He also stated that a river basin is a natural unit for economic construction, and the country can be divided into eight major river basins. The Yangtze River basin has a population of 200 million, nearly half of the country's population, and is known as the Golden Waterway. Nanjing is located at the intersection of the Central Avenue and the Golden Waterway, with the sea tide reaching directly under the city. Land, sea, and air transportation can all use this as a hub, making it the largest military center in the country, and it has a strategic guiding role for the great cause of national reconstruction.</p>

<h3>On Christmas Eve, Cardinal Tian Addresses All Catholics, Encouraging Them to Be Role Models for Society and Revive Traditional Virtues</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Cardinal Tian Gengxin, the Archbishop of Beiping, recently issued a letter to all Catholics on Christmas Eve. The full text is as follows:</p>
<p>Dear Catholics,</p>
<p>When I returned from Rome in June this year, I broadcast to you in Nanjing in the name of the first Chinese cardinal. Now it is again the eve of the Nativity of Our Lord. The arrival of this festival brings joy and peace to mankind. Today, on Christmas Eve, we must first express our sincere gratitude to Almighty God for all the graces of the past year.</p>
<p>The past year has been very important in the history of the Church in our country, and even in the history of the entire nation. During that year, we saw the appointment of the first Chinese cardinal, the establishment of the Catholic Church system in China, the designation of twenty provincial chief archdioceses, and the appointment of the first provincial chief archbishops, the abolition of the Apostolic Delegation to China, the appointment of the first papal nuncio to China, and the establishment of the papal nunciature. All these are very significant measures, which are epoch-making not only in the history of the Church and the nation in China, but also in the history of mankind and the world. We thank our Holy Father for his concern for the Church in China. Due to these measures, the Catholic Church in China has entered the realm of adulthood. Dear Catholics, precisely because of these measures, the responsibility of each of us Catholics has also been increased.</p>
<p>The Catholic Church is the holy and universal Church. The reason why the Catholic Church in China has the situation it has today is due to the continuous efforts of the various religious orders and the Chinese and foreign missionaries who are not members of religious orders. Their blood and sweat have irrigated this vineyard of God. Today, when the Church system has already been established in China, we should not only remember their past merits, but also cooperate hand in hand to promote the affairs of the Church in our country. Religion has no national boundaries, and the cause of saving souls has no nationality. In the realm of religion, we cannot allow narrow nationalism; we should actively promote the spirit of holiness and universality of the Holy Church. Dear Catholics, in the Pope's announcement, we see the Holy Father telling us that the threat to the Catholic Church is not external, but internal. Now that we see the establishment of the Catholic Church system in China, we must be careful to prevent the invasion of threats; we must defend our faith. We must unite. Chinese and foreign priests should be united as one, and the priests and the Catholics should also communicate with each other and participate in the spread of the faith under the guidance of the clergy. In the encyclical "Non abbiamo bisogno" (We do not need), Pope Pius XI mentioned the participation of Catholics in the Catholic missionary work. Therefore, it is the responsibility of every Catholic to cooperate with the clergy and promote our Holy Church under the guidance of the local bishops, so that those who have not yet seen the truth can also see the light. This is especially important in our China. Today, we Catholics account for only a very small number of the total population of the country. How to spread our Holy Church to more people is not only the responsibility of the clergy, but also the responsibility of every Catholic. Every Catholic should be a brave soldier of Jesus, each in his own position, to defend and spread our Holy Church.</p>
<p>However, when we think of the responsibilities that every Catholic should fulfill, we cannot but point out some of the current trends. The Church of Our Lord Jesus is built on the throne of the Apostle Peter; and Peter is the rock. The past efforts of the Catholic Church in China, following the glorious traditions of the Holy Church, are also built on a solid foundation; we cannot shake this foundation. All our efforts are for the "City of God" (Civitas Dei); therefore, every Catholic should not only have devout faith, but also express their faith in their actions, in their daily lives, so that our faith and our life and behavior become one and become a living faith. In today's society of moral decay and fallen ethics, we Catholics should be role models for society in order to change the social atmosphere. Our traditional spirit of honesty and sincerity must not be corroded by foreign frivolity. Every Catholic should remember the candle he held when he was baptized; we cannot allow fierce winds to blow it out.</p>
<p>For this reason, dear Catholics, we have a greater mission in today's society. Our leader, Chairman Chiang, saw the importance of rebuilding the moral order long before the War of Resistance, and urgently sought to revive the virtues of our country in order to establish a new life for the general public. In the efforts to build the nation's spirit, we should bear the responsibilities we should bear. We must use our religious life to set an example in this time of social disorder. National rejuvenation may then be possible.</p>
<p>Finally, I would like to ask all Catholics in our country to pray for our Holy Father and our national leader. May God bless the Holy Church in China, so that we can have today. May Almighty God, in our future difficult path, be able to illuminate us, as in the past; so that the arrival of the Christmas holiday can enable more people to obtain true peace and happiness.</p>

<h3>Editorial: Defending the Nation and Drafting the Constitution</h3>
<p>—In Commemoration of the Yunnan Uprising</p>
<p>Today is the anniversary of the Yunnan Uprising. After the National Assembly passed the draft constitution in the third reading, it also concluded successfully in Beijing this morning. A democratic constitution that the people of the whole country have been looking forward to day and night for many years has finally been drafted. Recalling today thirty-one years ago, General Cai Songpo launched the Yunnan Uprising, first declared independence, and finally overthrew Yuan Shikai's imperial system, and re-established a solid foundation for the Republic of China. This glorious history, although thirty-one years have passed, is still vividly remembered by the people of the country, as if it were before their eyes. Therefore, the National Assembly's successful conclusion of its constitutional work today has very significant meaning.</p>
<p>For thousands of years, our country has been an autocratic empire. In recent centuries, the people have gradually awakened and urgently demanded the democratization of politics. The success of the Xinhai Revolution achieved the initial goal, but Yuan Shikai, after becoming the president, was still not satisfied and insisted on becoming an autocratic emperor. This led to General Cai Songpo launching the Yunnan Uprising to defend the nation, and finally overthrowing the imperial system and restoring the republic. The politics of the Republic of China could have been expected to embark on a new and smooth path, but the warlord separatism and the manipulation of politicians caused years of domestic wars. After the success of the National Revolution and the Northern Expedition, the situation of unifying China was roughly settled, and the National Government followed Dr. Sun's teachings and moved from the military government period to the tutelage period, and then wanted to move from the tutelage period to the constitutional period. Just as the tutelage was about to end, the July 7th Incident suddenly occurred. After eight years of arduous resistance, the enemy was finally defeated, and the national foundation of the Republic of China was re-established.</p>
<p>From the day the enemy surrendered, the people of the whole country issued a call for "political democratization." At the same time, the ruling Kuomintang had long wanted to return power to the people, so that China's politics could embark on the right track of democracy and the rule of law as soon as possible. However, due to the long-standing problem between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, the National Assembly was repeatedly postponed, and its constitutional work could not be carried out. It was not until November 15 that the National Assembly was able to open in Nanjing. It closed today, completing the constitutional work, which lasted one month and ten days. This is the most important page in modern Chinese history.</p>
<p>During these forty-five days, the National Assembly engaged in constitutional work. Although there were also quarrels and instances of disrespect for order in the venue, this is an inevitable phenomenon in the parliament of any country, and it is enough to show the spirit of democracy and freedom. When the various groups were reviewing the draft constitution separately, the opinions of the representatives were inevitably complex, and various amendments were proposed. However, when it came to the comprehensive group, difficult opinions could be eliminated invisibly, so that the draft constitution passed by the entire assembly did not make fundamental revisions to the original draft proposed by the government. The original draft proposed by the government was based on the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference and then decided by the party meetings. Now it has been passed by the National Assembly, which shows that this new constitution is the crystallization of the will of the people of the whole country, and its implementation in the future will surely be twice the result with half the effort.</p>
<p>We have always believed that democracy cannot be transplanted and systems cannot be copied; and we also believe that there is no absolute superiority or inferiority in constitutional systems, and there will be advantages and disadvantages. It is only required that it be practical and feasible. Therefore, we believe that the constitution passed by the National Assembly is satisfactory; the problem in the future is not the constitution itself, but how to implement the constitution. Looking back at the international environment, because the Four Foreign Ministers' Conference and the United Nations General Assembly concluded successfully one after another, 1946 has a peaceful conclusion, and a beautiful prospect is unfolding for the world in 1947; therefore, we have unlimited new hopes for the domestic political situation: the new constitution of the Republic of China is scheduled to be promulgated on New Year's Day next year, and the government will also be reorganized after the National Assembly closes, expanding the government's foundation and recruiting all parties and factions as well as social notables to participate in it; at the same time, there is hope of reopening peace talks, and it is not impossible for the political situation to become clear from then on. Therefore, on this anniversary of the Yunnan Uprising, inspired by the martyrs' defense of the nation, and looking forward to the future of the Republic of China, we have strengthened our unwavering confidence.</p>
<h3>Asian Student Conference</h3>
<p>The tank ended World War I, the atomic bomb ended World War II, and after that there will only be one world, otherwise the world will be destroyed. The countries of the atomic age are as closely intertwined as the trees in a forest. If one tree catches fire, the fire will spread to all the trees. Unless there is a fire protection plan for the entire forest, it is not safe. Mankind should now realize that civilization, which is the result of human endeavor, should not be turned into cannon fodder. The atomic bomb has destroyed the earth, and it must also destroy mankind's prejudices and selfishness. Countries can no longer regard the private desires of their own countries as the highest morality, but must seek the prosperity of a system.</p>
<p>The war is won, and peace has only turned the first page. We see that in various international conferences, yesterday's allies have become today's enemies, and the euphoria of victory should not drive away the pain of blood. We should not regard the victory of the war as the end of our efforts, but should regard it as the beginning of our efforts. Nationalities must be equal, politics must be democratic, and the world must be peaceful. This is an irresistible world trend. Asia has many weak nations, and their desire for equality, democracy, and peace is even greater than elsewhere. Recently, Indian students launched the "Asian Student Preparatory Conference." Perhaps their declaration is for this reason. The most concise words in their English declaration are: "All our science, art, and culture are the light of the world. We lead the world to create a society, a nation, a human being, living in our own will."</p>
<p>The All-India Students' Association issued a notice in Mumbai on December 15, requesting students from Asian countries to send representatives to the first Asian Student Preparatory Conference on December 30, to be held in Lahore, the capital of Punjab, to organize an Asian Students' Association. The countries invited are China, Iraq, Iran, Afghanistan, Nepal, Bhutan, Myanmar, Java, Indonesia, and Vietnam. Our country has selected representatives from six universities: Peking University, Central University, Sun Yat-sen University, Sichuan University, Fudan University, and Ginling Women's University, and sent a team leader to fly to Kunming and then to India immediately.</p>
<p>This event, like the Pan-Asian Conference convened by India, came suddenly. It seems to have nothing to do with the World Federation of Democratic Youth, but there are clues to be found. The association was initiated by the United Kingdom and met in Paris in the summer of 1946. At the meeting, the Indian student representatives had already revealed the idea of an Asian international student conference. Whether this student conference is for India, for weak nations, or for the whole world, we cannot stand idly by. For India is for weak nations, and also for the whole world. For weak nations is for India, and also for the whole world. Are these three questions actually one question? At least these three questions have close interrelationships. In today's world trend, nationalities must be independent, politics must be democratic, and international relations must be peaceful. India has suffered for two hundred years and fought hard for two hundred years. Now the time is ripe. When the British Labour Party came to power, Prime Minister Attlee declared: "The Labour government firmly believes in the principle of national self-determination, and should find ways to help the 400 million people of India solve the difficulties of creating their own autonomous government." However, the goal of India's revolutionary movement is to build a completely independent country, rather than merely being satisfied with autonomy, because India's nationality, culture, and Britain, Australia, etc. are completely different and cannot be forcibly united. This point needs to be carefully considered and worked on.</p>
<p>At the end of this war, there was first the Atlantic Charter and the Declaration of the United Nations, which clearly stated the war aims. Then there was President Roosevelt's declaration of the Four Freedoms, and even the Moscow Four-Nation Universal Security Declaration. Finally, they were condensed into the United Nations Charter of the San Francisco Conference, all advocating that all nationalities have the freedom to choose their government, and that the revolutionary movements of weak nations can no longer be suppressed with bayonets and prisons, and that the world can no longer be half free and half enslaved. Today's world has shrunk, and security is absolutely indivisible. No strong country can independently resist foreign aggression. This war has already proven that no country can achieve victory alone. The future will be even worse. Even if most countries unite, they still cannot guarantee security. The peace of the whole world must be planned first in order to guarantee the security of the whole world. This is the lesson of the atomic age, and it is also the biggest reason for the development of world peace after the war.</p>
<p>Young students have the least personal gains and grudges, and are full of a sense of justice and a pure heart. They should cooperate equally with the Wang Zhe philosophy of China and all the representatives, in order to seek the security and peace of India, small nationalities, and the world. Perhaps this conference will be more successful than the Paris Peace Conference. China is magnanimous and is of course the leading country in Asia, but this leadership does not need to be fought for. Whoever can lead will be supported by others.</p>
<h3>The Eighteenth National Congress Passes Basic Policy Chapters</h3>
<p>The Guarantee for Journalists Still Failed to Be Included in the Draft Constitution</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 24th] The Eighteenth National Congress convened this morning at 9:50 AM, with 131 members present. Chairman Kong Xiangxi announced the opening of the meeting. Deputy Secretary-General Lei Zhen reported the decision of the Presidium's 28th meeting to extend the session to the 25th. Subsequently, the second reading of the constitution draft continued, starting with Article 140 of Chapter 12 on Basic National Policies regarding the national economy. Amendment 140, originally Article 142, was passed without objection. Regarding Article 141, which concerned private property rights and private enterprises, Ding Zhengcheng proposed an amendment stating that private wealth should be protected, private enterprises should be assisted in their development, and should not be restricted. After Ding's speech, Lei Zhen explained that it was a personal proposal by Ding without endorsement. Ding requested a discussion, but it was voted down as a minority view, and the original proposal was maintained by majority vote. Article 142 was passed with objections. Liu Zhendong and others suggested adding an article after Article 142, stating: "The central government, in order to promote balanced economic development between provinces, should provide appropriate subsidies to impoverished provinces. Provinces, in order to promote balanced economic development between counties, should provide appropriate subsidies to impoverished counties." Liu explained the reasons for the proposal as follows: (1) China has a vast territory, and the economic conditions of the provinces, or the counties within each province, vary greatly. If impoverished provinces and counties are not given appropriate subsidies, the development of the national economy will be impossible. (2) If the economies of the provinces and counties cannot be balanced, the development of the national economy will be greatly hindered. The original draft was too brief. The Seventh Review Committee had added several articles, but the Synthesis Committee omitted them, so they should be added. It was put to a vote and passed by a majority. Article 143 was passed without objection. Cui Wei-wu and others proposed an amendment, believing that Articles 144 and 145 should be merged because the former only stipulated that the state should manage finance according to law, and there should be more concrete provisions for financial institutions, and the term "grassroots financial institutions" in the latter was not clear enough. Therefore, merging and modifying the two articles would make the meaning more complete. It was put to a vote and rejected as a minority view, and the original proposal was passed by a majority. Regarding Article 145, Li Wenzhai and others proposed an amendment, believing that the term "grassroots" was ambiguous and should be changed to "farmers," and the following phrase should be changed to "to enrich the rural economy and improve the lives of farmers," which was biased towards farmers. General opinion was that it should remain "grassroots" to be more inclusive. A vote was taken, and the original proposal was passed by a majority. There was a proposal to amend Article 146 into a special chapter on overseas Chinese affairs, but after a vote, the original proposal was ultimately passed by a majority. The discussion then continued to Chapter 13 regarding social security, from Article 147 to Article 152, all of which were passed without objection. In Section 4, regarding education and culture, Wu Wentian proposed an amendment to Article 153, seeking to modify the wording regarding science, but it was voted down as a minority view, and the original proposal was passed by a majority. Regarding Article 154, Wang Bosheng proposed an amendment and explained that the future of China's revival should focus on the arts and culture. As an artist, Wang strongly argued for its importance and requested that the original draft be maintained, but ultimately the explanation was too long and did not gain majority agreement, resulting in a minority rejection and a majority passing the original proposal. Articles 155 to 158 were all passed without objection. Li Xianyang once proposed an amendment to add an article after Article 157: "Schools at all levels should gradually implement a free education system so that children from poor families can have the opportunity to receive advanced education, in order to cultivate a large number of talents," particularly emphasizing the awarding and assistance of outstanding children from poor families, but the public believed that it was not necessary to stipulate this in the constitution, and it was voted down as a minority. Regarding Article 159, Zhao Naichuan proposed adding the four words "recurrent expenditure" under the education budget, but a vote was taken, and the original proposal was passed by a majority. Article 160: "The state should guarantee the livelihood of education, science, and art workers and increase their remuneration from time to time in accordance with the progress of the national economy." Chen Yidi and others proposed an amended clause: "The state should provide education, science, art workers, and journalists with convenience in their work, guarantee their livelihood, and increase their remuneration from time to time in accordance with the progress of the national economy." Chen spoke at the podium, believing that the rights and interests of journalists should be included, but because the explanation was too long and the meeting time was limited, the order of the meeting became slightly chaotic. Fu Sinian spoke in front of the loudspeaker upstairs, but there was a lot of noise in the meeting hall. Fu vehemently claimed that the work of journalists was not done for the country and did not need to be included. After a vote, the amendment was rejected as a minority, and the journalists listening in the audience were all deeply disappointed. Subsequently, Bao Mingshu and others proposed that the words "journalism" should also be added to the clause. Bao said during the explanation that he was only arguing for these two words and asked everyone to show leniency, but ultimately it was rejected as a minority, and the original proposal was passed by a majority. Journalists were not included. Regarding Article 161, Wang Bosheng also suggested adding the word "art," but the result was that the original proposal was passed by a majority. Regarding Article 162, Zheng Manqing and others proposed adding an item under the first item of the article: "Domestic private medical businesses that perform well." The reason was that medical businesses were related to national health, and the annual amount of Western medicine imported into China was particularly alarming. In order to save the situation, the above article should be added. Fu Sinian refuted it, talking about the impropriety of traditional Chinese medicine. After his speech, a vote was taken, and the amendment was rejected as a minority, and the original proposal was passed by a majority. At that time, Ding Zhongying, a representative of traditional Chinese medicine, stood up in his seat and shouted, "Chinese medicine practitioners are also Chinese people, this is simply an insult to Chinese people, we are all Chinese people." His voice seemed to have a sense of sadness, and his attitude was extremely indignant. He immediately left with three or four other people in protest. Finally, the two additional articles proposed by the Eighth Review Committee were discussed: (1) Article 140, (2) Article 147, both of which were passed without objection. The Deputy Secretary-General announced that the second reading would be held in the afternoon.</p>
<h3>Mrs. Cripps Sends Letter of Thanks to Chinese Press</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 24th] The Capital Journalists Association recently received a letter from Mrs. Cripps, chairwoman of the British Aid to China Fund, expressing her gratitude to the Chinese press. The translation is as follows: "On the eve of my departure from China, I would like to ask you to convey my gratitude to the Chinese press. During this visit to China, I have received courteous treatment from all your colleagues, and I am immensely grateful, especially for the extremely appropriate manner in which the press conference was conducted, which was very thoughtful. I attach great importance to this kind of cooperation because it promotes friendship between China and the United Kingdom. I hope that you will convey my sincere feelings to the relevant people."</p>

<h3>Hangzhou Chamber of Commerce Requests Emergency Loan of 20 Billion to Help Industry and Commerce Overcome Year-End Crisis</h3>
<p>[Our Hangzhou Dispatch, 24th] The decline of Hangzhou's commerce is like the increasing severity of a cold day.

<p>[Our Yangzhou Dispatch] During the period when the counties in northern Jiangsu were controlled by the Communist army, all legal tender was plundered. Although most of the counties belonging to the Yangzhou, Huai, and Xu areas have been gradually recovered, the people's livelihood is declining, rural areas are bankrupt, and there is a severe shortage of currency in the market, making circulation difficult. The economic situation has almost fallen into chaos. It was previously learned that relevant individuals from the Xu and Huai areas have specially organized the "Huaihai Xu Area Economic Revitalization Promotion Association" and submitted a request through the Xuzhou Pacification Headquarters to the central government, requesting that financial institutions be quickly restored in the recovered areas of northern Jiangsu to handle agricultural loans, emergency relief, and small-scale loans. In addition, a banking group organized by local firms in Huaiyin will apply for loans from national banks in order to revive the local economy. The reporter recently approached an official from the financial sector who is about to go north for inspection to inquire about this matter. According to him, in addition to the Central Bank setting up branches in Yangzhou and Xuzhou, preparations are being made to establish branches in Huaiyin, Xinpu, Qingkou, and other places. In addition, China and the Agricultural Bank of China also plan to establish branches extensively in northern Jiangsu and southern Shandong. Regarding the financial measures for the pacification zone, since being approved by the Supreme National Defense Council, the Agricultural Bank of China has drafted measures for small-scale loans in northern Jiangsu and submitted them for approval. Currently, in order to meet actual needs, it has been decided to set up loan agencies in Gaoyou, Baoying, Taixing, and other places first. Once approved by the Executive Yuan, lending can begin. The amount has been approved at 300 million yuan per county, with an initial amount of 12 billion yuan temporarily set.</p>

<h3>The Seventeenth National Assembly - Smooth Second Reading of the Constitution Draft</h3>
<p>(Continued from yesterday's first edition) Subsequently, regarding the proposed addition of clauses, Zhang Yuanyang and others proposed amendments, arguing that since the title of Chapter 12 had been amended, and this spirit was based on Dr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings, especially the importance of exercising civil rights, the text should clearly define the rights of recall, initiative, and referendum. After Zhang's explanation, a vote was taken, but the proposal received only a minority of votes and was rejected. The original five proposed amendments were revised into three amended articles, which were passed based on the integrated committee's revision. Article 133 had amendment suggestions from Dai Xiujun and others, who proposed further amending the previously amended article. Dai Xiujun explained the proposal, but it received only a minority of votes and was rejected. The original amendment was passed. Article 134 was passed without objection. Article 135 had amendment suggestions from Zhao Zimao and others, who proposed changing "army" to "armed forces" in the original clause "No party or individual may use the army as a tool for political strife." They argued that no party or individual should use the army as a tool for political struggle, and other public forces and local teams should not be used for political struggle either. After Zhao Zimao's explanation, a vote was taken, and the proposal was passed by a majority. Article "136" was passed without objection. Article "137," which included a clause on respecting treaties and the UN Charter, had two proposals from Pan Chaoying and Wang Zhiyuan. Pan's proposal argued that the clause "respecting the UN Charter" should be deleted. The reasons for the original proposal were listed in five points, which were explained at length, taking up a great deal of time and causing a stir in the hall. There was a sense that he had to step down, and he left the podium amidst the ringing of bells. Hu Shi then took the podium and explained that the original draft's inclusion of the phrase "respecting the UN Charter" had been well-received worldwide, and deleting it would create great misunderstandings. It had already been amended to "respecting treaties and the UN Charter," and deleting it again would be another mistake. He stated that Pan's arguments were completely unfounded, believing that treaties could be modified, but the Constitution could also be modified, and the UN Charter was not easily modified. He concluded by urging everyone to respect the integrated committee's amendments and not make another mistake. Hu's speech was powerful, eloquent, and garnered much applause. Chen Guyuan then attempted to speak, but the majority felt that further discussion was unnecessary, and the hall became chaotic. Chen briefly expressed himself in a few words, saying: "We don't need to worry about the UN Charter being temporary, we should consider it long-term." A vote was taken, and Pan Chaoying's proposal was rejected. Wang Zhiyuan's proposal, which also aimed to remove the phrase "respecting the UN Charter," was rejected as well due to the UN Charter's temporary nature and the belief that China's constitution should not be bound by it. Ultimately, the integrated committee's amendments were passed by a large majority. Article 138 had three proposals from Xue Mingjian, Ma Xuchang, and Liu Ziya. Xue's amendment argued that the article should be simplified and follow the original draft. Ma's amendment sought to revise Articles 228 and 139, deleting Article 139 and adding "The methods shall be determined by law" after Article 138. Liu's amendment proposed adding the following clause after this article: "The currency system shall be based on Dr. Sun Yat-sen's principles of currency reform. Its implementation plan shall be determined by law." The original proposers of all three proposals provided explanations, but they were all rejected by a minority vote, and the original amendment was passed. Article "139" was passed without objection. As the time reached 6:00 PM, the meeting was adjourned. The second reading continued until the 24th before it was completed.</p>

<h3>Zhuang People's Boundary Demarcation Opinions</h3>
<p>The newspaper sent a message from Songjiang on the 9th: Regarding the opinions of the vice speaker of the Songjiang Temporary Consultative Assembly, Zhang Shizhi, I have to say something. I use the position of the residents of Xin Zhuang, where the dispute lies, to express my humble opinions and ask for advice from wise readers.</p>
<p>Since the Republic of China for sixteen years, Xin Zhuang has been designated as part of the Shanghai Provisional Receiving Area. There are records, case files and charts of the demarcation approved by the Executive Yuan and the Municipal Government at that time, which can be used for reference. It is not a continuation of the activities of the enemy puppet period, which is very clear. In the autumn of the thirty-fourth year, victory and peace were achieved, and the national territory was restored. Song County itself has thousands of things to be governed, and Xin Zhuang is regarded as an abandoned baby, especially the issue of education related to the rise and fall of the country, which has never been taken care of. Today, a year later, after all educational administrative facilities have been handled effectively by the Shanghai Municipal Government, it is only then that they know to recover jurisdiction. How can there be such a reason? Dr. Sun Yat-sen’s plan for Greater Shanghai. In the beginning, it did imply locking the economic lifeline of the rented territories. After the recovery of the concessions after the war, the original plan certainly needs considerable changes. However, Shanghai's status is due to the insincerity and non-cooperation of the domestic Communist Party, and other ports lack security and flexibility. It is clear that it is more important than before the war, and the population density has increased. The facilities of a big city are like this. As the director of the Municipal Works Bureau, Zhao, said in a special article (see this year's June 30th "This newspaper's forum on Saturday, must meet the needs of national defense, economy, culture, industry, commerce, transportation, and other aspects. Therefore, the regional issue in the current Greater Shanghai plan is not only not satisfied with the recovery of the commercial area of the leased area, but also requires more expansion than the forecast before the war. Xin Zhuang is an ideal good residential area, and it is also an important part of the future urban highway network. Its position is almost the same as the Xianggu area before the war. The opening of Zhongshan Road and Pudong Avenue, the construction of the administrative district, residential area, and Qiujiang Wharf in the city center, all illustrate the general implementation of the Greater Shanghai plan before the war. Today, it is necessary to continue to promote the request to receive the temporarily postponed area according to the needs of the facts. This is a matter of reason. The second and third points raised by Vice Speaker Zhang are obviously not facts. Moreover, this request for receipt is exactly the step of fulfilling the Executive Yuan's approval in the sixteenth year of the Republic of China. His fourth point is "...It should also be ordered by the Ministry of the Interior of the Executive Yuan to delineate it. There is no previous explicit text..." The remarks are even more contradictory. In short, under today's circumstances, what the people expect is to revive construction, live and work in peace. Whether it is a city or a county, it is a local agency of the country. There is no distinction between relatives and enemies. What is contested is the trend of the people's hearts and the people's opinions. Those who are close to the people will win the people's hearts. It has been the case since ancient times. The people of Songjiang County are not as benevolent as the people of our country, so they should not be loved by our people. All the facilities in Shanghai City do their best regardless of borders, so they have won the support of our entire public opinion. It's really not an accident. (Quei Shuikang)</p>
<h3>Discussion on the Changshu Levy Procedures</h3>
<p>In Yuyi County, there is a distinction between rented and self-operated property in terms of field tax. More than 70% of the county's rented households are rented, and less than 30% are self-operated. About three-quarters of the rentiers live in the city. This year, the field tax has been changed to in-kind, and it has been changed to zonal collection. The original intention was to facilitate the people and pay nearby. However, there are eight districts in the whole county, and four warehouses are set up in each district, and the notice only has the fields, the name of the district where it is located, and no explanation as to which warehouse a certain map should pay to. I am afraid that the consideration to facilitate the people and pay nearby will be counterproductive. Here is an example to prove it: Suppose there is a rentier household with fields scattered in eight districts, and each warehouse must pay. If one person is used to specialize in this matter, and one place is paid back and forth to the city for three days, then the 32 places in the whole county will take more than two months, and the freight and personal food and accommodation expenses are considerable. Therefore, I have repeatedly asked the Tianliang Office to improve the levy method as soon as possible. All the landlords in the city should pay to the warehouses in the city. If the string is scattered in the district, the collection warehouse will issue a temporary receipt. After the rural area invites the Tianliang Office to return the grain strings of the households in the city, those who hold the temporary receipt will exchange the stamped strings with the Tianliang Office, which will be convenient for both the public and the private sectors, so that the people will be spared extra losses.

<h3>Pray for the Zhenjiang Junhua Hall</h3>
<p>There is no one in Zhenjiang who doesn't know that the Junhua Zhishen Hall is a local charitable organization that pities the poor, helps the needy, and helps the needy. The Shantang was founded by local philanthropists Yu Xiaoquan, Cao Qing, and Sun Jingzhi. It is a treasure trove for the poor and a savior for the poor. Before the Anti-Japanese War, they would issue rice tickets and money tickets during the cold season of the year, and distribute cold clothes and rice porridge, so that the general poor and helpless people could maintain a difficult winter. Since Zhenjiang was looted by the enemy, compatriots in this huge provincial capital were massacred. The situation at that time could not be described in words. Under the arrogance of the enemy, the executors of the church were selfless and buried the dead to avoid the scattering of white bones. The spirit of fraternity is worthy of respect. At that time, the hall accommodated a large number of refugees, about 1,000 people. Fortunately, the winter relief rice was able to eat three meals a day and barely survive. Those who were rescued still sing praises of their merits. This year, war broke out in Jiangbei, and more than 10,000 refugees from northern Jiangsu fled to Zhenjiang. The hall selected those who were lonely and unable to make a living, and rescued them one by one. It also stipulates that in the morning, steamed buns are distributed, and rice porridge or rice is given in the middle and late hours, so that the people in northern Jiangsu are spared starvation. The church has more than 30 branch halls in the north and south of the Yangtze River, specializing in helping the world and cultivating blessings, and spares no effort to help the poor. I was requested by the authorities of the church in the 28th year of the Republic of China, and I took the job of making a list and conducting household surveys. I saw that the general poor people were able to get real benefits in great hardship. All the expenses of the hall rely on local merchants to help as they wish, and do not solicit donations from people. However, prices have soared in recent years, and it is expected that the expenses of the hall will feel exhausted. Now it is the season of severe winter, and the drums of the twelfth lunar month are urging the remnants, and those who have no clothes and no clothes are everywhere. I deeply hope that people in the sea can give direct and enthusiastic assistance to the church, so that benefiting the people is more meaningful than any good deeds! (Ma Xiezong)</p>
<h3>Appeal for Airport Land Rights</h3>
<p>I have lived in Wumajiazhai, southwest of Longhua, for generations, engaged in both commerce and agriculture, and I have been self-sufficient. In the spring of the 33rd year of the Republic of China, the enemy army expanded Longhua Airport, and all my cultivated land was occupied. The houses had not yet been affected. By the spring of the 34th year, the houses had also been affected by the expansion. Although it is called price collection, how much can it be? However, under the pressure of coercion, I had to move painfully. In total, there were more than 2,000 households and more than 30 villages that suffered the same harm for two years, with more than 5,000 oak houses and more than 5,000 acres of land. In the autumn of last year, the victory was announced in the Anti-Japanese War, and the sky was restored to light. I was able to revisit my old residence, but the land expanded in the 33rd year could not be used freely because it was occupied by the enemy, and it was dug and built into a city, and I could not cross into it. Now the land is still occupied by China Central Two Airlines. According to the construction of Longhua Airport, it was used by Eurasia Airlines, and it was rented from local people and paid considerable rent. Now China Central Two Airlines occupies a huge airport, but no money has been paid. I have been notified by the Municipal Land Administration Bureau that the owners must pay land price tax. I think there are obligations only after there are rights. Now that the right to use the land has not been recovered, it is ordered to pay the obligation of tax. I feel that I can't bear it. However, because the title certificate is still in my possession, I paid part of the tax. How should China Central Two Airlines, which actually uses the land, reduce the burden on me and many land owners? I read in the newspaper that the second meeting of the Municipal Council is about to be held. I hope that the councilors will raise the meeting for discussion to find a reasonable solution and to help the people of Su.</p>
<h3>Please send traffic police to McKen Road</h3>
<p>I am a student at Hengfeng Road National School in the city. I have to go through the road between Wuding Road and McKen Road every day to go to school. This is the McKen Road station. Trucks loading goods are constantly driving fast, regardless of the safety of pedestrians. There are no traffic police here. Today, when I was going home at noon, I was hit by a speeding truck and lost my life. However, because there was no post police, it was allowed to drive away. I fainted for a long time, and my classmates helped me to school. I would like to ask the police authorities to add post police between Wuding Road and McKen Road to maintain traffic and ensure the safety of a group of young students (Zang Daohong, a student at Hengyueshou National School).</p>
<h3>Shuangqiao people demand a station</h3>
<p>The Sujia Highway was opened on December 18, which is convenient for the people. According to reports, the price of millet from Jiaxing to Shuangqiao is 700 yuan. Unexpectedly, tickets for Shuangqiao are not sold. You can only buy tickets for Wangjiangjing. Therefore, the fare will cost twice as much. Why is there no station in Bianqiao before the war? I hope the Road Bureau will quickly add a Shuangqiao station to avoid unnecessary sacrifices in terms of materials and time for us! (Xia Songnian).</p>
<h3>Discussion on handling Chongming Zhaosha</h3>
<p>"A Record of Tianji, North of the Ming Dynasty" is detailed and thorough in the description of Qingbi, and it is indeed worthy of being the mouthpiece of the public. I am an old Miao, and three generations of grandparents have lost a lot. Now that it has risen again, the property rights naturally exist in law and in reason. In the 32nd year of the Republic of China, the provincial government went to the border area of Suyuan to liquidate the isolation. The said students were reported and led by a small number of people. Now that the provincial government has found out the truth and revoked it, it is the most wise. However, how to dispose of it after the revocation has not yet been announced. According to the said beach, as of today, it has been nearly 10,000 mu, and there is a trend to expand northward. If the mainland of Jiangbei rises rapidly, then this good field will be a national defense fortress. The old Miao only owns a strip north of Wanggong Embankment (named after Su's supervision of Wang Dankui's construction during his lifetime). After that, there will inevitably be incidents of sand disease and gangsters who seize the species without authorization. If so, then the sand field disputes will never end. The fighting in the autumn of this year may only be the prologue to a bloody tragedy. I deeply believe in Dr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings of "equal land ownership" and "cultivators have their fields". I deeply hope that the provincial and county governments may as well use Wanmu Liangsi as a trial area for the implementation of the new land system, which is convenient for the country and the people. I ask the high authorities, is it so? (Chongming Sharen)</p>

<h3>France Adopts Strong Policy to Maintain Interests in Vietnam; Leclerc Rushes to Vietnam to Oversee Military Affairs; Our Consul General Requests Neutral Zone, French Side Agrees</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Kunming, 14th] At 9:00 AM on the 23rd, the Chinese Consul General met with community leaders in the Sino-Vietnamese region to discuss establishing a neutral zone with the leaders of the Vietnamese resistance forces. French General Morlière fully agreed to open a neutral zone to concentrate overseas Chinese and peaceful Vietnamese. Overseas Chinese shops in the French-controlled area have resumed business. The overseas Chinese are very satisfied with the efforts of the French authorities and the Chinese Consulate.</p>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 23rd] Today, French forces in Vietnam, under the cover of aircraft and tanks, advanced on key routes in Hanoi to control Tonkin. However, the war now threatens to spread immediately to Cochinchina. If this occurs, the entire Vietnam will be engulfed in gunfire. Interim Prime Minister Blum reported to the parliament that the situation in Vietnam is serious, perhaps worsening, and explained that a firm policy of response has been adopted. General Leclerc, a renowned military expert in mechanized warfare, is being dispatched to the front lines to take charge. French authorities in Hanoi accused the Viet Minh of massacring French civilians, claiming that 29 dismembered bodies were discovered, including eleven women. Mr. D'Argenlieu, the French High Commissioner to Vietnam, has arrived in Saigon. Local French military authorities greeted him at the airport, but D'Argenlieu made no statement upon arrival.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 23rd] Prime Minister Blum made a statement in the National Assembly today, reaffirming the policy advocated three days ago by Colonial Minister Moutet. In short, the Blum cabinet will defend France's interests and protect French nationals. For security and defense purposes, military measures are unavoidable, but there is still hope that the policy on territorial alliances stipulated in the new constitution can be realized one day. From the perspective of French interests, opposition is expressed to the violent methods of the Viet Minh. However, the current governmental system does not believe that military means can solve everything. Although Blum has clearly taken all precautions, he also acknowledges that the old system of military colonialism is no longer applicable today. People from all parties have failed to fully understand this dual approach, leading the right wing to denounce it as a policy of concession that has caused the current situation. Conversely, the extreme left believes that the agreement signed with the Viet Minh Republic on March 6 has not been fully implemented by the French military authorities in Vietnam, but the National Assembly does not seem inclined to embarrass the government at present. The government's two actions have created a good impression in the parliament: first, Blum's opinions are completely consistent with those of High Commissioner D'Argenlieu to Vietnam; and second, Blum has dispatched General Leclerc, a famous French general of World War II, to Vietnam on Wednesday to preside over the situation.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Cairo, 23rd] Colonial Minister Moutet departed from here today for Karachi, India, en route to Vietnam to investigate the Franco-Vietnamese conflict. He is expected to arrive in Karachi at 8:00 PM tonight.</p>
<h3>French Forces in Nghệ An Surrender</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Paris] Yesterday's news: French authorities in the port of Vinh, Nghệ An, Annam, have obeyed the Viet Minh's ultimatum and surrendered to avoid the slaughter of French residents. A dispatch from Hanoi also states that all of northern Vietnam is now affected by the war. Although French forces in three cities near Hanoi, including Nam Định, are besieged, they continue to fight hard. To date, French forces in Hanoi have suffered 50 deaths and 150 injuries.</p>
<p>[United Press, Saigon, 23rd] The French Commissioner's Office and the Cochinchina Autonomous Government issued a joint announcement today, stating that Cochinchina is under attack by the Viet Minh.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 23rd] Well-informed sources in Paris say that French reinforcements are being urgently dispatched to Vietnam, and other troops are also preparing to depart at any time.</p>
<h3>Vietnamese Resolve to Fight a Long and Bloody War; Preferring Death to Slavery; Viet Minh Government Issues Declaration; Accuses France of Bearing Responsibility for the War</h3>
<p>[United Press, Saigon, 23rd] Ho Chi Minh, Chairman of the Vietnamese People's Republic, issued his first declaration yesterday after fleeing with government officials to Bắc Ninh, 15 miles northeast of Hanoi, after the outbreak of war last Thursday. He stated that the Vietnamese people would rather die than be slaves and are determined to wage a long and bloody struggle for freedom, "The 20 million Vietnamese will eventually annihilate 100,000 reactionaries." Ho attributed the responsibility for starting the war to the French authorities, accusing them of widespread arrests and implementing a policy of terror in Tonkin and Cochinchina, and of using aircraft to bomb women and children.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 23rd] Mr. X, the representative of the Viet Minh Republic in France, issued a statement stating, "In the name of the Viet Minh Democratic Republic, we are willing to cooperate fully within the French Federation, based on the agreement signed between France and Vietnam, to defend the independence of the Viet Minh and the unity of its nation." President Blum met with representatives of the Franco-Vietnamese Association today to discuss the matter. Furthermore, Mr. Y, the spokesman for the National Assembly's Military Budget Committee, stated that there are a total of 82,000 French troops stationed in Vietnam.</p>
<h3>France and the United States Discuss the Situation in Vietnam</h3>

<h3>World's Attention Turns to Antarctica; Competition to Form Antarctic Expeditions</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 23rd] The base of the British Antarctic Mawson Expedition will retreat to another base 300 meters away at the request of the US State Department, for use by the US Antarctic Expedition led by Lieutenant General Byrd. This base was originally established by Lieutenant General Byrd during his expedition to Antarctica in 1944. Lieutenant General Byrd has now left the United States and will meet with other ships at sea to travel to Antarctica. In addition to Britain and the United States, Norway, Sweden, and Australia, Chile and Argentina, may also have plans to explore Antarctica.</p>
<p>[United Press, Philadelphia, 23rd] Another Antarctic expedition team led by US Navy veteran Luo Nuo, consisting of 20 people, will depart from New York by ship next month for a 13-month expedition. The ship will be equipped with a cosmic ray telescope, shaped like an oval cake, which will begin operating when the expedition ship departs and continue to explore cosmic rays until its return, with significant discoveries expected. It is reported that the Batou'er Foundation used a Super Fortress for cosmic ray exploration flights in June this year, and the telescope was designed by the Foundation.</p>
<h3>British Colonial Office Announces Draft Constitution for Malaya; Overseas Chinese and Indian Trade Unions Express Opposition</h3>
<p>[United Press, Singapore, 23rd] The British government today announced a draft organizational law for the Malayan Union, in order to politically unite the previously loosely connected states and British Malaya. Military and diplomatic affairs of the Malayan Union will remain under British jurisdiction, as the rapid occupation of Malaya by the Japanese army in the early stages of World War II greatly embarrassed Britain, forcing it to take this as a warning. The draft constitution stipulates the following: (1) A central government will be established, presided over by a special commissioner appointed by the British monarch; (2) Federal citizenship rights will be extended to the majority of the people; (3) The Malayan Union will be composed of nine states and the colonies of Penang and Malacca. There should be a joint Federal Legislative Council and an Executive Council, and state governments should be established, presided over by local chiefs, with local British commissioners as advisors. This draft constitution was drawn up by a drafting committee composed of representatives from the British government, the chiefs of the states, and the United Malays National Organisation. It has been approved by the chiefs of the states and the British Cabinet and will now be submitted to Indian residents, overseas Chinese, and other ethnic groups for approval. However, the newly formed Pan-Malayan Joint Action Committee has opposed it. The committee is composed of 15 overseas Chinese and Indian trade unions, and its opposition is based on the fact that the draft constitution was established in secret meetings without seeking the opinions of the Malayan people beforehand. The draft constitution does not mention the status of Singapore, which will remain a British colony or the location of the Governor-General's Office. The Governor-General's Office will likely continue to govern Malaya, Sarawak, and British North Borneo. People from the states of Malaya, British people born in Penang or Malacca who have resided there for more than 15 years, British people born in the Malayan Peninsula whose fathers were born locally or resided there for more than 15 years, and anyone whose father was a citizen of the Malayan Union at the time of their birth can obtain federal citizenship. The British government will be responsible for protecting the Malayan Union, preventing its peace and tranquility from being threatened, and maintaining the financial stability and credit of the Federal Government.

<h3>France's New Budget; Military Spending Not Reduced</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 23rd] The French House of Representatives met tonight to discuss the budget and approved the item for military spending in the ordinary budget, totaling 41 billion francs, as well as the item for reconstruction funds in the special budget, totaling 35 billion francs. This budget is for the first three months of the next year. The military spending item has not been reduced compared to this year, because the situation in Vietnam is unstable, so reducing it is temporarily not being considered. Finance Minister Fei Lie Pu said that the ordinary budget can now be balanced, all because 50,000 civil servants will be laid off, and the amount of income tax will almost double. Financial experts say that the ordinary budget is balanced not because of the reduction of government expenditures, but because of the increased tax burden on the people.</p>
<h3>British Mathematicians Design and Manufacture Automatic Computer; Complex Problems Can Be Solved in Minutes</h3>
<p>[United Press, London, 23rd] British mathematicians are designing and manufacturing an automatic computer, whose computing speed is equal to or even surpasses that of the famous American electronic computers, and can calculate more complex problems. When using an electronic computer, the keys must be continuously turned according to the calculation problem. The automatic computer uses a type of card inserted into the machine, with holes punched on the card, like a password. Complex math problems that take several hours to solve with an electronic computer can be solved in just two minutes with an automatic computer. Electronic computers only record 200 decimal places, while automatic computers can record up to 15,000 places and can solve equations with more than 50 or more than 100 unknown factors. This machine will take two or three years to manufacture and will cost more than £100,000 (equivalent to US$400,000).</p>
<h3>Myanmar Constitutional Discussion to Be Held in England at the Beginning of the Year; Myanmar Leaders Not Optimistic About the Prospects of Negotiations</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Yangon, 23rd, United Press] According to reliable sources, the Anti-Fascist People's Freedom League has decided to accept the British invitation to participate in the discussion on the Myanmar constitution. This decision was made at a meeting on the evening of the 22nd after the chairman of the alliance, Aung San, returned to the alliance headquarters from Dunasalem. It is reported that the delegation will travel to London in the first week of January next year, and its members will include Dajin Miying of the Socialist Party and Aung San and others.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Yangon, 23rd] U Nai Kyaw, vice-chairman of the Anti-Fascist People's Freedom League of Myanmar (Myanmar's largest political party), told reporters that the Burmese people are not very optimistic about the British government's convening of a round table conference on the issue of the Burmese self-governing government. If the negotiations fail, we cannot avoid being driven into an inevitable path. Although we know that our strength is not enough to resist airplanes, artillery, and bayonets, we are confident that our position is just and our demands are reasonable. This is a permanent force. We are determined to fight to the end with that kind of force. We do not doubt the sincerity of the British Labour Party government, but the reactionaries in Britain and Myanmar have considerable power, so we expect that we will hardly achieve our goals without struggle.</p>
<h3>Four Unlikes; Four Heads Shipped to New York</h3>
<p>Horns Like Deer, Head Like Camel, Feet Like Cow, Tail Like Mule</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 23rd] Four rare Chinese elks (pere david's deer) were recently shipped from England to the New York Zoo. These monsters were originally raised by the Duke of Bedford in England and were named "Father David's Deer," and were obtained through negotiations by the New York Zoological Society. The shape of the elks is not very beautiful. The horns are like deer, the feet are like cows, the head is like a camel, and the tail is like a mule, so they are called "four unlikes." In 1866, a Catholic priest named David preached in China. David was a naturalist who knew that the imperial garden contained elks. He tried to obtain several and transport them to Europe, naming them Father David's Deer in memory. At the beginning of the 20th century, all the elks in Beiping were killed by the army, and those in Europe gradually decreased to seven. The Duke of Bedford bought them all and bred them to 250. The elks' first link to the United States. The animal scientist hopes that the four elks shipped to the United States can be greatly bred in the future.</p>

<h3>Britain Asks Egyptian Government to Allow British Troops to Enter Sudan; Negotiations to Revise British-Egyptian Treaty to Resume</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Cairo, 23rd] The British government has requested the Egyptian government to allow British troops to enter Sudan via Egypt until the British troops have completed their withdrawal. The Egyptian government is currently studying this request. However, according to well-informed sources, Egyptian authorities are deeply concerned that if the request made by Britain is approved, it will create a dangerous precedent.

<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 24th] The Foreign Office here recently confirmed that the head of the British delegation, Stansted, will soon go to Cairo to conduct revisions of the 1936 British-Egyptian treaty.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 23rd] Authoritative sources say that Sudanese religious leader Madi visited Foreign Secretary Bevin yesterday before departing for Sudan, stating his views on the future status of Sudan, strongly advocating that Sudan should be completely independent and opposing its merger with Egypt. He also had two long talks with British Foreign Secretary McNeill and met with British Chief Representative for the British-Egyptian negotiations, Stansted.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Cairo, 23rd] Sudanese independence movement leader Madi arrived here today from London. Because the Egyptian government ordered him to be prohibited from entering Cairo, he was forced to stay at the airport under police supervision, waiting for a plane to take him to Khartoum, Sudan. 191 Executions in One Year</p>

<h3>The Second Post-War Christmas Offering: May Peace Prevail Throughout the World (Continued)</h3>
<p>In the aftermath of the war, the situation in the Near East remains unstable, and peace has not yet been restored in the Far East. Let us hope that Christmas brings the gospel of peace, so that all people on earth may receive grace…</p>
<p>[United Press London, 23rd] Sixteen months after the end of World War II, conditions in Europe and the Near East are turbulent, and peace has not been restored in the Far East. The following is a snapshot of various Far Eastern countries during the second post-war Christmas season.</p>
<p>Philippines: Constabulary forces are trekking through the rugged mountains of central Luzon to suppress guerrillas. The guerrillas are referred to as rebels, and the result of the campaign over the past few months is that more than two thousand people have died. The guerrillas were formerly the "People's Anti-Japanese Army," and its members are rich in guerrilla warfare experience. They oppose overthrowing the government by violence but insist on agricultural reform.</p>
<p>India: The Congress Party, led by Hindus, insists that an independent India should be a unified republic with Hindus in the majority party position, while the Muslim League demands separate governance for Muslim-majority provinces. Added to other religious and political factors, the situation is even more complicated. British authorities estimate that since the British government announced the plan for Indian independence in May of this year, the number of people killed due to Indian-Muslim conflict has exceeded ten thousand. No fewer than fifty thousand British troops stationed in India have been deployed to try to suppress the riots.</p>
<p>Netherlands East Indies: Although a ceasefire order has been issued after several negotiations between the Dutch and the East Indian independence army, there are still minor conflicts in Java and Sumatra from time to time. As a result of the negotiations, a draft political agreement was established, stipulating the establishment of an independent United States of East India within the Dutch East Indies Federation. The Dutch East Indies estimates that approximately nine thousand one hundred troops are stationed in the old boundaries before the Allied withdrawal, possessing tanks and aircraft. On the East Indian side, the Javanese forces number one hundred and forty thousand, of which about half are armed; Sumatra has three divisions, of which seven-tenths are armed. The continued conflict is due to four reasons: (1) sixteen months of hatred has not been eliminated; (2) insincerity, with most soldiers on both sides opposing a peaceful resolution and desiring a military solution; (3) the East Indian authorities have no binding force over irregular guerrillas; (4) the Commander-in-Chief of the Army should, for military security reasons after the withdrawal of British troops, advance the Dutch front line by about one mile, which the East Indian side considers to be a violation of the ceasefire agreement.</p>
<p>Vietnam: The French army and the Vietnamese independence army are still at war, and the ceasefire order in October was ineffective. Fighting is fierce in some locations. It is reported that the French army has a well-equipped force of 50,000, with a small number of aircraft and small gunboats. The Vietnamese army includes regular troops, militia, and young conscripts, and appears to outnumber the French army. The French side claims that there are Japanese soldiers within the Vietnamese army. The Vietnamese army possesses mortars, machine guns, and a small number of cannons. The center of the dispute is in Cochinchina. The Vietnamese side demands that Cochinchina be incorporated into Tonkin and northern Annam to form the territory of the republic, while the French side insists that the two regions should be separate. Last week, the Vietnamese army re-launched the war in Hanoi and Tonkin. French authorities claim that 29 civilians, including 11 women, have been killed, and their bodies were cruelly dismembered. The French side has declared martial law in Tonkin and southern Annam. It is also reported that more than 200 French soldiers have been killed in recent battles.</p>

<h3>Concealing and Trading Enemy and Puppet Materials: All Cases Will Be Under the Jurisdiction of the District Court Hereafter; The High Procuratorate Directs the District Procuratorate to Investigate the Wang Binpei Case According to the Interpretation of the Judicial Yuan.</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Since the signing of the Potsdam Agreement, the people's concealment or purchase of enemy and puppet materials should be separately established as a kind of crime under criminal law, which has been interpreted by the Judicial Yuan Xie Zi No. 3250. However, in the past, such cases were all prosecuted by the High Procuratorate according to the Regulations on Punishing Traitors, and the cases were under the jurisdiction of the High Court. Now, there is a case in which Wang Binpei colluded with Japanese people to conceal and sell several properties after the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan. According to the interpretation of the Judicial Yuan, the High Procuratorate specially instructed the District Procuratorate to investigate the case according to law. Hereafter, such cases will be investigated by the District Procuratorate first according to the crime of species, and will be handled by the District Court.</p>
<h3>The Goods of Yongye Rice Store Were Confiscated; The Municipal Government Ruled to Revoke the Punishment; The Case Was Transferred to the District Procuratorate for Joint Judgment According to Law.</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] It was reported in July of this year that Chen Zhangshi reported Yongye Rice Store for hoarding food rice for sale on the black market. The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau learned through investigation that the store was a member of the Flour Industry Association and started business on December 21, 1945. However, it has not yet registered with the food authorities as required, and the rice that is sold together with the flour is not listed in the store, nor is it prepared with account books in accordance with the regulations, and the quantity, name, and price of the buyers are never recorded. The Social Affairs Bureau confiscated seven shi and five dou of white rice and nine shi and five dou of brown rice stored in the rice store in accordance with Article 4 of the Provisional Regulations on Punishing Food Crimes in Extraordinary Times. The rice store refused to accept the punishment and filed an appeal with the municipal government, putting forward five reasons:</p>
<p>(1) Brown rice cannot be sold in this city and cannot be regarded as hoarding. (2) Small shops are accustomed to only recording the total account and not keeping a daily account of customers. (3) The crime is considered inappropriate. (4) Applying for business registration through the association is not illegal. (5) The Social Affairs Bureau is violating the law and trampling on the common people. After the appeal was submitted to the municipal government, the respondent authority submitted a response together with the case file. Recently, the municipal government ruled that the main text: "The original punishment is revoked, and the part of the appellant's hoarding of food rice should be transferred by the original punishing authority to the District Procuratorate for joint judgment according to law." Yesterday, the Social Affairs Bureau transferred the case to the District Court Procuratorate. According to the municipal government, this case is the first case to accept an appeal and revoke the original punishment after the victory.</p>
<h3>The Executive Committee of the Import Control Committee Resolves on Two Important Cases</h3>
<p>The Executive Committee of the Import Temporary Management Committee held a meeting yesterday afternoon at 5:00 pm in the Central Bank Building. The meeting lasted for more than an hour, and the results were announced as follows: According to customs regulations, goods should be declared and picked up within 15 days of arrival at the dock. If the goods are picked up after the deadline, a fine should be imposed according to the regulations. The Import Temporary Management Committee, taking into account the actual difficulties in importing, has specially agreed with the customs that if the delay is indeed due to the committee's handling of the audit procedures, the fine for delayed pick-up can be waived.</p>
<p>For goods loaded with domestic products from one port to another, which must be transshipped through Hong Kong to reach the designated destination, no import permit is required. However, when declaring for export, the cargo owner should provide the customs of each port with a true settlement of equivalent cargo value to prevent abuses.</p>
<h3>District Baojia Re-investigate Opium Smokers; The Civil Affairs Department Explains Laws and Regulations.</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The Municipal Civil Affairs Department is handling the re-investigation of opium smokers in the district baojia in accordance with the decision of the Municipal Government. At 2:00 pm yesterday, the directors of the civil affairs departments of the 30 districts were convened in the auditorium on the eighth floor of the Police Bureau to explain the relevant opium prohibition laws and regulations.

<h3>Taking Back British Merchants' Water and Electricity; Immature Timing</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] According to Zhang Rentao, Deputy Director of the Public Utilities Bureau, who told our reporter: Regarding the recovery of the Shanghai Electric Tramway Company of British Merchants and the Water Company of British Merchants, the timing is not yet ripe. Further in-depth research is still needed on various perspectives. Electric trams and water are public utilities, and valuation is difficult, so experts must be hired to take responsibility.</p>
<h3>Xujiahui Cathedral Requests Illumination</h3>
<p>Xujiahui Cathedral once gave up a portion of its land to build Rue de la Mission, and all the streetlights on the road were supplied by the church. Because this road is an important traffic artery in Xujiahui, with constant traffic of vehicles and pedestrians, it has now been converted into a highway. The church believes that it is no longer obliged to provide streetlights, and because of the restrictions on the amount of electricity used since the regulations were implemented, the church itself does not use much electricity, making it even more difficult to supply. In order to maintain public security and avoid traffic accidents, the church is now requesting the Public Utilities Bureau to quickly supply electricity and install streetlights to facilitate winter security. The Public Utilities Bureau is already working on finding a proper solution.</p>
<h3>Continued Trial of the Zang Da Erzi Case; The American Soldier Who Was the Killer Was Not Mentioned.</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] After the preliminary trial of Lai Qina, a suspect in the Zang Da Erzi case, by the District Court on the 10th of this month, it was originally scheduled to bring the American sailor Roth Rick, who was the killer, to court yesterday for confrontation. However, without the consent of the American military authorities, only Lai Qina was summoned yesterday. Lai confessed that even if the American soldier who committed the crime came to court today, he might not recognize him, because there were many American soldiers passing by at the time, and the killer was also an American soldier passing by. He did not know him and did not instigate him. The court did not question him because the witness did not arrive, and ordered him to be detained and rescheduled for retrial.</p>

<h3>The Plan to Build a Greater Shanghai is Being Studied by Experts.</h3>
<p>A National Park is to be established in the Taihu Lake area; The area along the Huangpu River in Pudong is to be developed as a residential area.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The Public Works Bureau recently revealed for the first time a 50-year plan to build a Greater Shanghai, covering the Yangtze River, Zhapu, and the Taihu Lake area, at an informal reception for the U.S. delegation. This plan was drafted three months ago and is now being studied in detail by six architects and two engineers of the Urban Planning Committee. Mayor Wu serves as the director of the committee, and Zhao Zukang, Director of the Public Works Bureau, serves as the reception secretary.</p>
<p>According to architect Lu of the committee, this plan is divided into transportation, industrial areas, residential areas, and seaports. The purpose is to make Shanghai one of the best cities in the world from both a practical and aesthetic point of view. Shanghai is more convenient than London and New York in terms of urban planning, because there are no restrictions on Chinese-style or valuable buildings. These buildings are obstacles to reform. Most of Shanghai's current buildings are old and dilapidated. The new plan includes appropriate demolition. The meaning is that the city is not squeezed together, but is divided into many independent towns, which are connected to the urban area of Shanghai to form a large city. These towns can be further divided into many neighborhood units, each with transportation links. According to accurate estimates, in the new Shanghai with one million residents in the future, the current urban area of 50 square miles will become the heart of this large city and can accommodate 7 million people. The rest of the population will be distributed in districts, towns, and neighboring areas. Each neighboring area unit can accommodate 400 to 100 residents. Shanghai itself will be separated from the surrounding areas by a ring road and grassland. This grassland will be used for recreation.</p>
<p>The architects of the Public Works Bureau have also carefully considered the design of factory locations to avoid dust and other factors. In the future, Shanghai will expand outward into five districts. Each district will have railways and highways connecting to the heart of the city. These highways will have no intersecting branch roads and traffic lights, so that cars can travel at 60 miles per hour.</p>
<p>The plan also mentioned the current port facilities. It is planned to designate Zhapu as a seaport and Wusong as a river port. Zhapu also has a river channel passing through Longhua, which leads directly to the Huangpu River in Shanghai.</p>
<p>The number of airfields will be reduced from the current five to four. Jiangwan Airport will be moved to Zhabei, and Longhua Airport will be made suitable for runways facing northwest by west. Another airport will be built behind the Zhapu seaport. All airports will be able to undertake international transportation tasks and will be connected to highway and railway networks.</p>
<p>Secondly, a national park will be established in the Taihu Lake area. The north and south of Taihu Lake will be developed into agricultural areas, and the area along the Huangpu River in Pudong will be developed as a residential area.</p>
<p>Engineer Buck, who is currently teaching at St. John's University, supplemented Lu's remarks and pointed out that the Pudong Bridge has been deleted from the plan because it is impractical and too expensive. Buck also had a dissent to the plan, that is, there is too little construction in Pudong.</p>
<h3>"Thank You" Slogan for Ordering a Bill After a Meal; Drop it Into the Mailbox; The Financial Bureau Prints New Slogans to Promote the Collection of Banquet Donations</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] In order to strictly collect the banquet donation in this city, the Municipal Finance Bureau has printed uniform bills for restaurants and issued them to restaurant merchants for application. Now, it has further negotiated with the post office that after customers obtain the bill, they do not need to add envelopes and stamps, nor do they need to provide an address. They can directly drop it into the mailbox for the Finance Bureau to check.</p>
<p>It is reported that in order to promote publicity universally, the bureau has printed two types of slogans: (1) Please ask for a bill and drop it into the roadside postal mailbox, thank you. (2) You have paid the banquet tax for dining here, please be sure to ask for a bill to take out and help with municipal construction, thank you. These slogans have been handed over to the collection offices in each district, and staff have been sent to distribute them to the restaurant merchants, embedded under the glass table top, or in other places where customers can see them. Notices have also been sent to the two trade associations of the liquor and vegetable industry and the Western food and coffee industry.</p>
<h3>Sketches of Christmas Eve</h3>
<p>Yesterday was Christmas Eve, an annual holiday with religious significance. Children are looking forward to gifts from Santa Claus in red clothes and white beard, adults pray that next Christmas will be better, while wealthy families dance and laugh, never tired of pleasure, forming a strong contrast with the starving people wandering the streets. All dance halls are decorated with lights and colors, doing their best to be extravagant, and inserting various entertainment programs to entertain guests. A cup of tea in a dance hall costs between 20,000 and 30,000 yuan. The Christmas meal at Paramount costs 100,000 yuan per person, and the other major hotels such as Cathay and Jinmen cost between 50,000 and 80,000 yuan. Most Chinese restaurants also add tips. Although the prices are expensive, they are full everywhere. If you don't book in advance, you will miss out. Although the police have banned dance halls from operating overnight, there are still many dance halls that are celebrating wildly after midnight. Most Westerners eat turkey at home to celebrate Christmas. The U.S. Army and Marine Corps held Christmas dances. With the music rising, green girls and red men danced and celebrated to their heart's content. However, because the number of U.S. troops in Shanghai has decreased by 80% or 90% compared to last Christmas, it is not as lively as last year. Embassies and consulates of various countries in Shanghai held Christmas receptions. The Argentine Embassy also scheduled a costume ball to be held on New Year's Day, inviting celebrities from all walks of life to participate. The Air Force Xinsheng Society and the Shanghai Branch of the Lizhi Society in Shanghai also held dances to celebrate the winter solstice. All cinemas have increased their prices, but there are not many famous films. "Waterloo Bridge" at Dahua, "A Song to Remember" at Cathay, and "Fantasia" at Haida are the most popular. Because of the arrival of Christmas, prices in Shanghai have risen again and again. Christmas items such as a turkey cost as much as 110,000 to 120,000 yuan, and it is very difficult to buy genuine goods. The sales of foreign wine are also strong, and a bottle of brandy is worth 50,000 to 60,000 yuan. Pious Catholics go to the church to "attend Mass" to thank the Lord's grace. Christians have the ceremony of "reporting good news." The song "Ave Maria" and the crisp bells of the church make people feel touched by the scene. The American warship Boston, which is anchored on the Huangpu River, is scheduled to host orphans at 11:00 am this morning, to celebrate the universal joy. In the Hongkou area, small bars and low-class dance halls are places for Allied sailors and people of the middle and lower classes to have fun. The dance music played is the same as in the large dance halls. The song "White Christmas" is the most popular. After the bells rang at midnight, everyone shook hands and wished each other "Merry Christmas."</p>
<h3>Canned Food Prices Surge; Store Owners Smile.</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Recently, due to the stimulation of gold prices and the extra demand for the Christmas holidays, the prices of canned food have fluctuated greatly, with increases ranging from 10% to 30% to 40%. Fruit foods have risen less, generally about 10%. Canned milk, milk powder, and foreign wine have fluctuated the most, rising by about 30% to 40%. For example, Klining milk powder, which was sold for 5,000 yuan a week ago, was priced at 8,500 yuan the day before yesterday. However, after the gold price fell yesterday, the market price of canned food also dropped significantly. When the store owners talked about the rising gold price, they couldn't help but smile.</p>

<h3>The Hushe New Year's Group Worship; A Luncheon Will Be Held at Noon.</h3>

<h3>A Scene in Front of the Police Bureau; An Old Man Leads His Family; Kneels and Burns Incense to Appeal for Injustice; It Is Said That His Young Son Was Framed When Arrested.</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] At about 11:00 am yesterday, in front of the Police Headquarters, there was a fifty-year-old man leading his family members and children, a total of thirteen people, kneeling and burning incense, shouting that they had been wronged. At one time, there were hundreds of onlookers. Later, the police took the old man and others into the bureau for questioning. It is said that his name is Zong Yukuan, from No. 640 Guihua Road. Recently, his youngest son, Jinfa, was falsely accused by someone to the Putuo Road Police Station, pointing him out as a bandit, and was arrested. A pistol was also found in his home. During the investigation period, his son had already confessed to jointly robbing Shunchang Foreign Cloth Store with his accomplices Yin Kaifa and Zhao Genzhi. However, this fact is an injustice, and he said that the pistol found earlier was deliberately framed by others and secretly hidden in his home. After finishing speaking, the old man burst into tears, and finally took out a petition from his arms, with more than 2,000 words, which was to be presented to Director Xuan. However, after the police officer showed the petition to his superiors, he learned that the case had already been transferred to the Constitutional Office of the Garrison Headquarters for interrogation. As a result, the old man left with his children in frustration.</p>
<h3>The Year-End Party of the Zhonghua Tobacco Factory Resolved; Female Workers of the Nanyang Company Went on Strike.</h3>

<p>All the female workers of the Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Company started a strike yesterday morning. After hearing the news, the Social Affairs Bureau sent staff to persuade them, and instructed the female workers there to send representatives to negotiate with the factory. However, the female workers refused to accept it. When asked about the purpose of their demands, some said they wanted a year-end bonus of three or four months, and some said they wanted 300,000 yuan. It was impossible to understand what they wanted. The factory union has also been trying to persuade them without success, and has gone to the Social Affairs Bureau to ask how to handle it. It is heard that the Social Affairs Bureau summoned the person in charge of the company to discuss the matter at about 4:00 pm yesterday.</p>
<h3>Unearthing Secrets with a Mortise Chisel: A Morphine Den Cracked Down in Huangpi South Road, Over a Dozen Men and Women Arrested</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent] Tao De Kui, a 40-year-old man from Haimen, Zhejiang, previously engaged in the charcoal business, had been renting a room at 326 Longgong Hotel, Baxianqiao, Shanghai, for two months. In early this month, Teng Yongxi, Deputy Director of the Putuo Road Branch Bureau, received a tip-off that Tao was suspected of trafficking heroin. He immediately dispatched officers Zhang Xiaolin and Zhao Yongji, disguised, to purchase three small packets of morphine, and arrested him. They also confiscated 30,000 yuan in original legal tender marked with a code. Furthermore, they found twelve packets of morphine in his wife, Tao Zhang's, pocket (five packets containing one qian each, and seven packets containing one fen each). During interrogation at the bureau, Tao confessed that he purchased the heroin from Chen Xinxiang's house at 35 Xihu Lane, West Gate Road, for 50,000 yuan per qian, divided it into six small packets, and sold each packet for 10,000 yuan, making a net profit of 10,000 yuan per qian. Based on the confession, officers Li Xingyuan and Wu Shiling were dispatched to investigate. They found that the</p>
<p>House Was Spacious,</p>
<p>With Only Two or Three Residents. They confiscated 2.6 million yuan in cash on the spot and discovered that Chen Xinxiang had deposited several million yuan into the Jiashan Qianzhuang on Tianjin Road over the past six months. Suspicions arose, and Chen and his wife, Chen Lin, were arrested and taken to the bureau. The branch director, Qi Jingzhi, interrogated them and learned that the heroin trafficking operation was located on Huangpi South Road. Therefore, on the 22nd at dawn, section chief Gu Zhensan, along with police officers Zhou Xuqi, Chen Qidang, Shen Jinyao, Yang Bingsheng, and others, disguised and escorted Chen Xinxiang to 4 Junyi Lane, Huangpi South Road. They brought Zhao Zonghong, a man from Xuzhou, and his wife to the bureau. Meanwhile, plainclothes officers remained at the house to keep watch. Upon arriving at the bureau, they found a</p>
<p>Mortise Chisel</p>
<p>And a paper resembling a receipt next to Zhao's wife, Wang. When asked about drug use, both denied it. Subsequently, Wang was taken back to her home for another search, where three small bags of heroin were found hidden behind the bed in a Ruyi pouch. Furthermore, over ninety Ruyi pouches used for storing heroin were discovered. During strict questioning at the bureau, Wang remained cunning and refused to disclose the source of the heroin, only claiming that her brother, Wang Xingshan, had shipped it from Nantong and stored it at her house. She said Wang resided in room 20 of the Zhonghua Hotel. Officers were dispatched to investigate and arrest him, but no such person was found. Later, branch director Qi Jingzhi and deputy director Teng Yongxi, along with section chief Yin, led officers and Zhao Zonghong, accompanied by officers from the Taishan branch, to 4 Junyi Lane for a</p>
<p>Detailed Search,</p>
<p>Ultimately discovering a secret compartment on the third floor. The mortise chisel found next to Zhao's wife, Wang, was specifically used to open the secret compartment, which contained: (1) A wooden box containing fourteen small bags of heroin, weighing ten liang, and twenty-four liang of raw material including wrapping paper; (2) A porcelain mortar and pestle; (3) Five large and small stamps, and a stamping box; (4) Two biscuit tins; (5) A leather suitcase; (6) Over ten million yuan in checks; (7) A gold bar weighing one liang, and twenty pieces of gold jewelry weighing seven liang and nine qian. With the evidence irrefutable, the house was handed over to his son (Zhao Xiaoyuan, 15 years old) for safekeeping, along with the local Bao and Tian chiefs. Simultaneously, the plainclothes officers guarding the house had also successively arrested Wang Guoliang, Zhu Huangshi, Mao Shenshi, Huang Tongbao, Chen Fengyou, Ji Guangfu, and six other heroin purchasers who came to the house. They were all taken to the bureau for investigation but denied selling drugs. The branch bureau has now detained all the suspects pending further interrogation.</p>

<h3>Fire on Dalianwan Road</h3>

<h3>Want to Buy a New Car? First Ask If You Have Gold Bars: The Latest Black Market Price Survey</h3>
<p>[Special Report] Car transactions in Shanghai are calculated in gold bars. A better car can sell for nearly twenty bars. However, there are still people who want them, and demand exceeds supply. Car dealers say in unison: "There is business, but there are no cars." Of course, if you don't care about bars, it's not difficult to buy a brand-new car. Customs does not allow the import of cars with factory prices exceeding 1,200 gold collection units. However, "everyone has seen that there is no shortage of fancy cars on the road." So how did they get in? Insiders say that those who can pull strings have their own ways!</p>
<p>On the one hand, due to customs restrictions on imports, and on the other hand, due to insufficient production in the United States, the number of cars imported this year is only about one thousand. There are less than ten car dealers in Shanghai, distributing products from British and American factories. Due to the above reasons, although orders are very enthusiastic, delivery is quite difficult.</p>
<p>Currently, cars officially imported by customs from the United States cost about US$1,000 at the factory price. Dealers add various fees and profits, setting the price at about US$3,000 to US$4,000. However, the current market price is actually around US$7,000 to US$10,000.</p>
<p>"Buick" cars are quite popular in the market and now sell for 20 bars, with only thirty-odd arriving in total. "Studebaker" has a total of forty vehicles arriving, priced at US$3,000, but the market price is 13 bars. "Ford" arrived in relatively large quantities, priced at over US$2,000, but the market price is also 13 bars. Two "Mercury" cars recently arrived, selling for seventeen or eighteen bars each. As for "Lincoln," it cannot be imported now, so we haven't heard the music-sounding horn yet.</p>
<p>As for small cars, the "Standard" distributed by the Newbell Company had one hundred vehicles arrive. Orders placed previously can all be delivered this year, priced at US$3,600, but the market price is also around ten bars. There are not many Austin cars. Eighty "Fiat" cars arrived, with small and medium sizes, priced at four and a half to eight bars for the larger one. Eight "Chrysler" six-cylinder cars were recently imported and sell for 18 bars. Eight-cylinder "Packards" have also arrived, with market prices exceeding 20 bars.</p>
<p>Therefore, we can now see that car transactions in Shanghai are distorted and unreasonable. You have no way to buy a car at a fair price. Sometimes, when the order arrives, the dealer refuses to deliver the car and must make up for the black market difference before they give you the car.</p>
<p>In addition, some people bring cars directly from the United States because, according to regulations, each person can bring a car as luggage. When these cars arrive in Shanghai, they enter the black market. At the same time, some dealers from other cities also do black market business in this city because Shanghai's market price is too profitable.</p>
<p>In addition to wealthy businessmen, the banking industry buys the most cars. Small cars are mostly purchased by doctors and lawyers.</p>
<p>As for the car industry next year? Almost all car dealers shook their heads. Because of the difficulty of importing, although the amount of American car exports may increase next year, the number of cars in Shanghai will probably be less.</p>
<h3>Gangsters on Fumin Road Shoot and Wound Police Officer, Car Passing by on Nanjing Road Flees</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent] Dou Changtao, a 30-year-old police officer from Anhui, assigned to the Jing'an Temple Police Station, was on patrol duty with police officer No. 675 on Fumin Road at 1:20 AM yesterday morning. When they reached the intersection of Zhongzheng Road, they saw two men who looked flustered. They tried to check them, but one of them drew a gun and shot Dou. The officer immediately returned fire. The thug shot and injured Dou's right leg, causing him to fall. Police officer No. 675 bravely gave chase, but when they reached the intersection of Nanjing West Road and Changde Road, a private car, No. 14109, happened to pass by. The thugs took the opportunity to jump into the car and force the driver to flee towards Jiangsu Road. Afterwards, No. 675 reported the situation to the branch and immediately sent the injured police officer to the police hospital for treatment. After receiving the report, the branch immediately sent a large number of police officers to the vicinity of the incident to pursue the suspects, but they found nothing. Car No. 14109 was later found at the intersection of Jiangxi Road and Huashan Road. The driver, Shi Shen'an, was taken to the bureau for questioning and then released. Several revolver shells were also recovered from the scene, and they are currently being examined. The injured police officer had a bullet lodged in his scrotum and underwent surgery last night. He is not in serious condition.</p>

<h3>Mayor Answers Three Questions: One Million Dan of Rice Prepared to Be Released, Salaries of Public and Educational Personnel Expected to Be Adjusted This Year, Conscription Considered a Way to Train the Body</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent] Yesterday, reporters visited Mayor Wu and asked about rice prices, year-end bonuses, conscription, and other issues. He gave the following answers:</p>
<p>Question: Rice prices have recently risen sharply. Has the Mayor paid attention to this and sought to suppress prices?</p>
<p>Answer: Black market rice prices have indeed been discovered in the city recently. The reason for the sharp rise is purely due to the influence of foreign exchange. I believe that it will subside in a few days. There is absolutely no problem with rice supply in the city. I still have more than one million dan of rice in my hands, which I can take out when necessary.</p>
<p>(2) Question: What is the Mayor's opinion on the issue of year-end bonuses for workers?</p>
<p>Answer: Regarding the issue of year-end bonuses for employees, the central government has an order stipulating that it should not exceed one month. I also believe that the consequence of high wages is factory closures and worker unemployment. Therefore, I sincerely hope that both labor and management can understand each other. I am delighted with the understanding of the yarn factory workers, who initially requested a year-end bonus of five months, but resolved it with forty days.</p>
<p>(3) Question: Civil servants usually have low salaries and live a hard life. As the end of the year approaches, how can the city government help them?</p>
<p>Answer: Chairman Chiang has issued an order to adjust the salaries of civil servants, and I believe that the order will arrive here within the year. The city will immediately comply with it after receiving the order. If the order is not received by the end of the year, the city government may find a way to temporarily borrow a portion, but it is best not to publicize it in advance, because even if the city government provides subsidies, the amount will be very small, causing everyone to wait with bated breath, and the result will inevitably be disappointing.</p>
<p>(4) Question: Has the city government's budget for next year been completed? What percentage of the budget is allocated to education?</p>
<p>Answer: The budget for next year has indeed been prepared and is currently being sorted out by the accounting office. The total amount does not exceed the possible income of more than 230 billion next year. Educational expenses account for 30 percent of the budget. We must do our best to maintain education.</p>
<p>(5) Question: What is Mayor Wu's opinion on the conscription problem in the city?</p>
<p>Answer: Since Commander Chuan Zhengmo of the Garrison District came to Shanghai, conscription work should be actively carried out. Serving the country is the duty of a citizen, and there is nothing to be afraid of, and it should not be avoided. If I had a child of conscription age, I would definitely send him to the army first, so that he could train his body.</p>
<p>(6) Question: How will the Mayor spend this Christmas holiday?</p>
<p>Answer: Public servants have no entertainment and no rest. If this continues, I'm afraid it's the mayor who will have to implement "labor draft."</p>
<h3>Food Vice Minister Pang Songzhou Returns to Beijing: Talks About Abundant Grain Reserves Before Departure</h3>
<p>Pang Songzhou, Vice Minister of Food, who came to Shanghai from Beijing the day before yesterday, took a fast train back to the capital at 1:30 PM yesterday. Pang told reporters before his departure that his visit to Shanghai was purely for personal matters and had no other tasks.

<h3>Business Tax Issue for the Book Industry: Ministry of Finance Agrees to Plan in Detail, Petition Representatives Change Date of Trip to Capital to Early Next Month</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent] The Shanghai Book Industry Guild held an emergency joint meeting of directors and supervisors at its office on Tibet Road Central at 3 PM yesterday. Li Bojia, Zhang Yiqu, Guo Nongshan, Xu Boxin, Yao Pengzi, Liu Jikang, Zhou Xihe, Jiang Zhenzhan, Wang Zicheng, Tang Wendui, and more than a dozen others attended to discuss the request to exempt the book industry from business tax. It was decided that all petition representatives would change the date of their trip to Beijing to January 2 and petition again, to present the actual difficulties and reasons for exemption to the Ministry of Finance. If the goal is not achieved, the entire industry will close down.</p>
<p>Ministry Approval</p>
<p>According to the industry, in order to exempt business tax, it had previously held a temporary membership meeting, and twenty representatives were elected on the spot, originally scheduled to go to Beijing yesterday (24th) to petition. Just as they were about to leave, they suddenly received a reply from the Ministry of Economic Affairs, so an emergency joint meeting of directors and supervisors was convened. The original approval from the Ministry of Economic Affairs was as follows: "The Ministry previously received a submission from Chairman and industry representatives Guo Nongshan, etc., requesting exemption from business tax for the book industry. We have forwarded the request to the Ministry of Finance, asking them to consider the special circumstances of the industry and grant an exemption or deferral. This has been approved and recorded. Now, with reference to the Ministry of Finance's public letter No. Jingzhi 10970 Zi 6104 dated December 5 of this year, it is stated: 'It is noted that the book industry is closely related to education and culture and is extremely important. The book industry suffered particularly heavy losses during the war and it is difficult to recover in a short time, which is a real situation. In order to promote national policy and maintain cultural undertakings, it is necessary to support the book industry. However, there are many types of books, and not all of them are important. If a blanket exemption from business tax is granted, it would be unfair and other industries would inevitably request similar exemptions, affecting tax collection. The Ministry is currently planning a proper solution in detail, and it will be implemented once approved. Therefore, we hereby notify you and instruct you to inform us accordingly.'</p>
<p>Guild Opinion</p>
<p>The Industry Guild had a thorough discussion at yesterday's joint meeting of directors and supervisors. Everyone believed that the reasons listed by the Ministry of Finance were very far-fetched. If the Ministry of Finance is afraid that other industries will follow suit, then the governments of England and France exempt books from taxes but impose heavy taxes on cosmetics, and it has not been heard that exempting books from taxes has caused protests from the cosmetics industry. If it is said that there are many types of books, and it is difficult to determine the standard of which is more or less important, all books with formal publication addresses and publishers have their cultural significance and value. There are varying opinions, and there is absolutely no distinction between light and heavy. As for pornography and pirated copies, in fact, there is no place of publication, and it is impossible to tax them even if you want to. Moreover, textbooks have already been exempted first, and general books cannot be exempted from the list, because books representing the culture of any country are considered general books, not textbooks.</p>
<p>Cultural Loans</p>
<p>To understand the current situation of the book industry, the reporter visited the person in charge of the guild. According to him, among the 268 members of the guild, only a few can barely survive. The vast majority are facing ruin due to high costs, reduced purchasing power of readers, and the pressure of high interest rates. Currently, the best-selling books are pornographic books, and the more unsatisfactory ones are children's books, because the latter are cheap. As for general theoretical and new literary books, they are relatively slow-selling and difficult to win. Due to transportation not having recovered and high postage, there is little hope for expansion in other cities, except for pornographic books. The person in charge said: Culture is the foundation of the country, and the government should be keenly aware. In addition to a complete exemption from business tax, cultural loans must also be provided to save the current crisis in the book industry. It is said that the guild will also have a special submission on cultural loans in this petition.</p>

<h3>Our Newspaper Provides Aerial Advertising, Zhengtai Factory Gives Away Thousands of Overshoes</h3>
<p>Zhengtai Xinji Rubber Factory, located at 55 Zhongzheng East Road, produces Equality Boots and men's and women's overshoes under the Warrior brand. The quality of the goods is excellent and very popular. To expand advertising and attract users' attention, the factory has commissioned our newspaper to conduct aerial advertising.

<h3>Ohlhaver Case: Siebert on Trial, Denies Involvement in Espionage</h3>
<p>[Report from our Newspaper] The US Military Tribunal continued the trial of the Ohlhaver case yesterday. The defendant is Siebert, the former German Consul in Guangzhou.</p>
<p>Siebert testified that after the German surrender, his responsibility was to instruct German expatriates in Guangzhou. He admitted that he still retained the title of consul at that time, and his mission for the Axis powers had not changed. His reason was that he had not received a formal dismissal order from the German government. Colonel O'Connor, the prosecutor, immediately questioned him about the meaning of "unconditional surrender." Siebert, who holds a doctorate in law, replied: "Unconditional surrender means that one side of the defeated country surrenders unconditionally to one side of the victorious country."</p>
<p>Siebert further admitted that he knew that Hasse, Ublichi, and Niemann of the Guangzhou branch of the Ohlhaver Bureau continued to engage in espionage activities after the German surrender, but he himself never participated in them. His reasons were fourfold: (1) His superiors had instructed him not to interfere with Hasse's work; (2) Hasse was directly under the command of the Ohlhaver Bureau; (3) His own work was only in the area of German expatriates, while Hasse was working for both Germany and Japan; (4) The Japanese military authorities also instructed him not to interfere with Hasse's affairs.</p>
<h3>Army Ordnance Depot Explosion Case Concludes, Military Tribunal Held Joint Trial Yesterday, 13 People Involved Were Summoned, Chuan Jimin Has Been Detained, Vice Minister Qin Dechun Will Return to Nanjing Tonight to Report</h3>
<p>[Report from our Newspaper] The explosion at the Jiangwan Army Ordnance Depot of the First Supply Region of the Logistics Command, after investigation and interrogation by Vice Minister of National Defense Qin Dechun in conjunction with relevant parties, was formally tried jointly at the conference room of the Military Law Office on the third floor of the Police Headquarters yesterday afternoon, ending after 6 PM.

Fang Caifa, a transport soldier who had been reported missing and wanted, was apprehended the night before and severely interrogated yesterday. Other relevant soldiers were also interrogated separately, and a decision was made on how to handle them.

Vice Minister Qin is scheduled to return to Nanjing tonight to report on everything. If Wang Renshan and others are arrested in the future, Qin will come to Shanghai again to preside over the trial.</p>
<p>The joint trial began at 1 PM yesterday. In addition to Qin Dechun presiding over the trial, Zeng Zhaoyi, Chief of the Military Law Office of the Garrison Command, and Tao Yishan, Chief of the Investigation Office, served as judges.

<p>After the joint trial, Commander Zeng met with reporters and said that Fu Wen, Commander of the First Supply Region, and Mao Shenghua, Chief of the Ordnance Office, should be subject to administrative sanctions for the Jianghu military depot explosion.

<h3>Wanted: Zhou Guo</h3>

After the victory, Zhou fled in fear of punishment. The Shanghai High Procuratorate filed a formal public prosecution based on Zhou's crimes. However, because Zhou is on the run, the High Procuratorate issued a warrant for his arrest yesterday, ordering his detention.</p>
<h3>Heavy Fog at Sea, Many Vessels Delayed</h3>
<p>New Waterway Discovered in the Yangtze River, Long'an Vessel Arrived in Shanghai the Day Before Yesterday</p>
<p>[Report from our Newspaper] Maritime industry sources confirm that due to recent cloudy weather and heavy fog at sea, ships are having difficulty navigating, resulting in delays for most international liners. The General Gordon arrived in port yesterday and docked at the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's No. 1 pier. The President Madison, originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai yesterday, has not been seen due to the sea fog. According to the company, it is expected to arrive roughly tomorrow. The cargo ships Fumen Victory and Lotte Slovan Toga are also delayed until tomorrow. The China Merchant Steam Navigation Company also has three ships arriving.</p>
<p>[Another Report] The Yangtze River water level has receded sharply, as reported in previous issues. Yesterday, the Long'an ship of the Sanbei Company reported that the water levels at Daijiasha and Shazhou were between 9 feet 6 inches and 10 feet, making it difficult for ships with a draft of more than 13 feet to pass through. However, it has recently been learned that the customs marker has discovered a new waterway with a depth of 13 feet, so the ship arrived in Shanghai on the 23rd.</p>
<h3>Flood Prevention Plan for Next Year Decided by Public Works Bureau, Improving Ditches and Setting Up Pumping Stations</h3>
<p>[Report from our Newspaper] The city's emergency flood prevention project for next year has been planned and decided by the Public Works Bureau and approved by the Municipal Council. The details are as follows: (1) Improve the waterlogging situation near Risheng Building. The construction site is from Nanjing East Road to the Suzhou River. A pumping station will be set up, with a net cost of more than 670 million. (2) Improve the ditches on Jiangsu North Road. The construction site is from Changning Road to the Suzhou River. A pumping station will be set up, with an estimated budget of approximately 580 million yuan. (3) Improve the ditch project in the Wuning Road area. A pumping station will be set up, with an estimated budget of more than 610 million yuan. (4) Improve the ditch project in the Xizang North Road area, with an estimated budget of more than 66 million yuan. (5) Improve the ditch project in Huoshan Road, with an estimated budget of more than 74 million yuan. (6) Improve the ditch project in the Yuyu Road area, with an estimated budget of approximately 273 million yuan. (7) Immediately raise the embankment, with the construction site along the Huangpu River and the Suzhou River, with an estimated budget of approximately 110 million yuan.</p>
<p>The Municipal Public Works Bureau believes that the accumulation of sewage is detrimental to the health of the citizens, so the flood prevention project must be rushed. An entire plan has been drawn up, and it is rumored that the total cost will reach 11.3 billion yuan. However, because the municipal government's finances are extremely tight next year, the expenditure is limited to no more than this year's amount, which is 2.4 billion yuan. The Public Works Bureau will use this as a standard and make the above decision on the emergency flood prevention project for next year, based on the importance of each section.</p>
<h3>Navigation Industry Work Competition to be Implemented Next Year</h3>
<p>The Central Work Competition Promotion Committee is promoting the work competition in the transportation industry in Shanghai. The situation in the shipping industry is relatively complex, and satisfactory results cannot be achieved without the full cooperation of officials, merchants, labor, and capital. Therefore, it has repeatedly contacted all parties to organize the Shanghai Shipping Industry Work Competition Steering Committee. The inaugural meeting was held at 3 PM on Monday of this week in the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's conference room. The seven units participating in this organization include the Shanghai Maritime Affairs Bureau, the state-owned China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, and the shipping industry, marine engineers, drivers, and the China Seamen's Association. It was decided that the competition items should be simple and easy to implement. For the time being, the three items are navigation safety, fuel conservation, and schedule accuracy. The competition will be based on ships as units, and it is stipulated that all ships of 500 tons or more must participate in the competition. The competition standard will be based on the record of the three months after 1946. Rewards: For the outstanding personnel participating in the work competition, in addition to the committee requesting the Central Work Competition Promotion Committee to award prizes and gifts at the National Work Competition Award Ceremony on May 5th each year, the Shanghai Maritime Affairs Bureau intends to request the Ministry of Communications to approve the competition results as one of the standards for the assessment and promotion of marine engineering drivers.

<p>(1) Severe Neuralgia</p>
<p>Dai Xiehua asks: I suddenly suffered from soreness in my left waist in early July. A week later, the pain gradually moved down to my left leg and sciatic nerve. Daily life is inconvenient. In August, taking a cold shower caused pain in the muscles on the back of my left thigh and calf. After being diagnosed by a doctor at the Central Hospital, he said that it was caused by an injury to the lumbar spine, with something protruding and pressing on the nerves in my left leg. Surgery was required for recovery, but the results of the X-ray failed to reveal the source of the illness, so it was abandoned. Later, I changed to the Department of Neurology for examination, but the source of the illness was not revealed. The symptoms are still the same, I often suffer from insomnia at night, my appetite is poor, my hands and feet are numb, and I am very mentally distressed. What disease am I suffering from? Is there any special medicine that can be used for treatment? [Answer by Dr. Zhang Zhongming] Your illness may be polyneuritis. You can inject Vitamin B and take phosphorus compound supplements.</p>

<p>[Answer by Dr. Zhang Zhongming] Your illness is chronic arthritis. There are many causes, such as tuberculosis, rheumatism, and gonorrhea. An X-ray and blood test should be used to determine which type of arthritis it is before deciding on a treatment plan.</p>

<h3>Production Loan Amount Undetermined, Will be Approved Individually According to Actual Needs, Emphasis on Post-Loan Assessment to Prevent Malpractice</h3>
<p>Chairman Huo Speaks to Reporters</p>
<p>[Report from our Newspaper] In order to make all sectors understand the progress of the work of the Provisional Review Committee for Production Loans of the Four Joint Offices, Chairman Huo Shitse held a reporter reception at 11:30 AM yesterday at the China Bank on the fourth floor. Mr. Huo addressed as follows:</p>
<p>The establishment of this committee aims to cooperate with the government's import management policies, assist in the turnover of production funds for factories, gradually solve their current difficulties, and achieve the goals of increasing production and post-war economic recovery. Previously, President Song came to Shanghai and repeatedly discussed with leaders from all walks of life, and decided that the Four Joint Offices would hire the chairman of the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce and the banking industry association, representatives of the Municipal Government's Economic Department, and 12 people in charge of national banks and bureaus as members, in order to unify the forces and jointly plan the implementation. In the past ten days, the work has gradually been launched. The important matters are reported as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Work Overview: This committee was established on the 10th of this month, and holds regular meetings every Tuesday, Wednesday, and Friday to review applications and discuss various important issues. So far, five regular meetings have been held, and important regulations have been formulated. For example, the "Instructions for Applying for Loans," "General Rules for Loan Review," and "Measures for Handling Loan Cases" have been published. All application forms have been rushed to be printed and distributed to national banks and bureaus and commercial firms for factories to collect and fill out.</p>
<p>(2) Application Procedures: This committee accepts applications from factories, not from industries. Because the quality of each industry varies, we must make some choices and assist the healthier ones. In order to effectively use the country's limited resources, in principle, we hope that the application will be transferred by the bank that has business dealings with the factory. Because only the bank that has business dealings with the factory knows best about the factory's credit and its financial needs.</p>
<p>(3) Loan Terms: The loan interest rate has been reduced to 4% per month, and the loan ratio is 50%. Machinery and factory buildings can be used as collateral.</p>
<p>(4) Loan Amount: The amount will be determined individually based on the actual needs of each factory, and no amount has been predetermined. It is impossible to estimate in advance without the application from each industry. All kinds of figures circulating outside are speculation.</p>
<p>(5) Approval Procedures: If each applicant factory can prepare the necessary forms in accordance with the regulations of this committee, the preliminary investigation and review, and the approval by the meeting can be completed within one week. Cases that have been decided by the meeting and handed over to the bank for processing must also be signed and reported within three days. In short, the handling of loan cases is always done as quickly as possible by this committee and the banks. We hope that each applicant factory will read the application instructions carefully in advance and complete the necessary procedures. At the same time, provide convenience to the investigators and provide the necessary information, so that delays can be reduced.</p>
<p>(6) Post-Loan Assessment: In the past, national banks were very strict in the pre-loan review, but the post-loan assessment was too lenient, which easily caused malpractice. This time, this committee attaches equal importance to the pre-loan review and the post-loan assessment when handling production loans. Therefore, it is stipulated that the lending bank will send personnel to audit the borrower's use of funds, and this committee will set up a roving audit to conduct random checks at any time to ensure that the loan is used for production. In the future, if anyone is found to be cheating, the competent authority will be asked to punish them severely. We also hope that the public opinion circles will express correct opinions and effectively restrain them. The reasons for the current industrial crisis are varied, such as high interest rates, high wages, the competition of foreign goods, transportation difficulties, and the decline in purchasing power, which cannot be solved by the financial side alone. The Central Government is aware of this and has consulted with the relevant competent authorities to plan countermeasures to overcome the difficulties. If each factory can make good use of the loan, improve technology, reduce costs, increase production, and improve quality, and lay a foundation for itself, then economic recovery can be expected.</p>
<p>Finally, Mr. Huo answered the questions raised by the reporters. The main points are as follows: (1) The organization of this committee is mainly based on the Central Bank, supplemented by the three national banks and one bureau, and commercial firms. (2) Applicants must truthfully disclose their own illnesses, especially the production costs, so that the committee can prescribe the right medicine. (3) The amount of loan applied for must be reasonable. For example, it was recently discovered that the total annual sales of a factory were only 800 million yuan, but the amount of the loan applied for reached tens of billions of yuan. This phenomenon should not exist, otherwise, it will only prolong the time for investigation and review. (4) The investigation work is currently divided into two parts. The investigation of business and financial aspects is entrusted to the Joint Credit Reporting Center. The technical aspects are entrusted to the Ministry of Economic Affairs for investigation.</p>
<h3>Increased Pressure, Tightening of Money Supply, Gold Price Continued to Fall Yesterday, US Dollar and Hong Kong Dollar Also Fell Slightly</h3>
<p>Under the circumstances of continued pressure and extremely tight money supply, the gold price continued to fall yesterday. The opening price in the morning was 3.7 million, but it was difficult to find a buyer. A transaction was only made at 3.68 million. For a while, the selling pressure was overwhelming, and the supply was surging. It immediately went downstream and broke into the 3.6 million mark. After 10 o'clock, the Central Bank distributed 55 taels at a price of 3.55 million. After entering, the buying interest was even more sluggish. The Central Bank recklessly exerted pressure, and the money supply was tightened. It was difficult to rise after the fall. It once broke into the 3.4 million mark, and then stabilized slightly, but it was not easy to maintain at around 3.45 million. At noon, it struggled at 3.42 million. In the afternoon, the spot settlement market was mediocre. After 3 PM, scattered buying suddenly had a misunderstanding and once approached the 3.5 million mark. However, due to the continued pressure, it finally remained at 3.43 million. As a result, it fell by another 200,000 compared to the previous closing. The price of jewelry gold fell by 370,000. The price of silver dollars rose again. The black market interest rate was even tighter, rising to about 20%.</p>
<p>The foreign exchange also fell yesterday. The US dollar was sold at 7,000 yuan in the morning, and gradually weakened, falling to a low of 6,500 yuan at noon. The exchange rate stabilized slightly in the afternoon, hovering between 6,600 yuan and 6,800 yuan, a continued decrease of 200 yuan compared with the previous closing. Hong Kong dollar spot exchange rate rose to 76 yuan yesterday, also decreased. It finally hovered at around 1,350 yuan, a decrease of 80 yuan compared to the previous closing. The Hong Kong exchange rate fell from 1,380 yuan to 1,330 yuan. The Indian exchange rate was 1,650 yuan, and the British exchange rate was around 21,500 yuan. Transactions were still more active in the Hong Kong market, and the rest were sluggish.</p>
<h3>Government Bonds Fall Back</h3>
<p>Government bonds also fell yesterday due to widespread panic. Tongbing opened at 1,400 yuan, with a low price of 1,380 yuan. After that, there was short covering activity, and it gradually rose to 1,630 yuan. However, people were still uneasy, and it finally fell back to 1,420 yuan. As a result of the struggle, it fell back by 430 yuan compared to the previous closing. Jiayi and Jiyi fell by 380 yuan, and Tongding and Tongwu fell by 280 yuan. The transaction volume was more than 4 million yuan.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Salt Loan Consortium Loaned 19 Billion</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Salt Loan Consortium's work in 1946 has come to a close. Yesterday, the consortium announced that the loan amount for each jurisdiction in this year totaled 19 billion yuan. The Bengbu-Xuzhou Special Zone had the most, and the Jiangning District had the least. The detailed figures are as follows: Henan 3,753,270,000 yuan, Hebei 517,791,000 yuan, Hunan 1,174,000,000 yuan, Anhui 348,700,000 yuan, Bengbu-Xuzhou 3,880,036,800 yuan, Jiangxi 169,000,000 yuan, Jiangning 11,000,000 yuan, re-discounted foreign exchange 406,304,000 yuan, guaranteed period tax 560,083,200 yuan, discounted Hankou 6,073,074,000 yuan, totaling 19,059,919,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Silk Prices Plunge</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the price of gold plunged, which led to a collapse in confidence and a decline in the market. D-grade raw silk opened at 5 million yuan, and spot goods were priced at 4.8 million yuan, with a few deals. The price fell by 300,000 to 400,000 yuan compared to the maximum price on the previous day. There were no transactions in dried silk, etc. People in the industry were still bearish, so the market was unusually quiet yesterday. Due to the abundance of spot goods, 120-count rayon yarn also declined. Toyo Brand was offered at 600,000 yuan in the market, and Takayama Brand was offered at 460,000 yuan. Dull rayon opened at 3.8 million yuan, a decrease of 50,000 to 80,000 yuan compared to the previous day. Semi-gloss goods were extremely scarce and factory sales were very popular, so the price was high yesterday. The price of Meiya silk quilts was offered at 3.05 million yuan yesterday, but no one cared about 3 million yuan. Dachen silk quilts were offered at 2.9 million yuan, with 800,000 yuan bought and sold. Although the price of checked wall crepe was offered at 10,000 yuan, the buyer only offered 9,500 yuan. Dawei wool fabric was still selling well, and the market was slightly higher yesterday. The price of Hangzhou goods in the place of origin was reported to have risen, and the Shanghai market was 100 yuan higher yesterday. The rest were mediocre and unchanged.</p>
<h3>Rampant Smuggling in South China, Tung Oil Supply Obstructed</h3>
<p>[Report from our Newspaper] Due to rampant smuggling in South China, the supply of tung oil in Shanghai has been affected. It is reported that not only the tung oil produced in Fujian is transported to the south, but also the tung oil that used to be concentrated in Wenzhou, which was usually transported and sold to Shanghai, is now all exported through Hong Kong. For this reason, the Bureau of Social Affairs invited the China Vegetable Oil Factory, the Shanghai Paint Industry Association, and the Tung Oil Industry Association to hold a discussion meeting yesterday to discuss countermeasures. They unanimously agreed to send a letter to the Ministry of Economic Affairs to try to stop smuggling to the south.</p>
<h3>New Regulations on Cotton Cloth: Private Cotton Mills Would Rather Shut Down Than Accept, Unable to Agree to Government Regulations on Purchase Quantity and Profit</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] The Sixth District Cotton Spinning Industry Association convened a temporary members' meeting of Shanghai yarn factories yesterday. More than 30 representatives attended, chaired by Mr. Wang Qiyu. First, it was reported that the 17th Spinning and Weaving Control Committee, based on Premier Song's six-point instructions on cotton cloth control, resolved a new method to stabilize yarn prices. The main points are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) For yarn factories that have purchased foreign cotton or intend to purchase foreign cotton, the government will purchase half of the cotton yarn produced from today. If they weave the cotton yarn into cloth themselves, the government may purchase their cotton cloth.</p>
<p>(2) The purchase price, except for 10% of each factory's production volume, will be sold to the government at cost. The remaining 40% will be priced at cost plus a legal profit of 22%. The above price will be determined by one representative appointed by the Yarn and Cloth Control Committee, one representative from the Spinning and Weaving Construction Company, and representatives from private factories, reviewed and approved by the Weaving Review Committee.</p>
<p>(3) The remaining yarn and cloth, excluding those purchased by the government, will be centralized by each factory for open trading in the market (Shanghai plans to use the old site of the Yarn and Cloth Exchange). The names, amounts, and uses of the buyers and sellers in the above transactions shall be compiled into a detailed table and submitted to the competent authority for review on a daily basis.</p>
<p>(4) The government will use all the purchased yarn and cloth to balance yarn and cloth prices. If the above allocated price exceeds the purchase price, the government will deposit the surplus in a special account for subsidizing cotton production and developing the textile industry.</p>
<p>(5) Hereafter, 70% of the yarn and cloth made from cotton purchased with foreign exchange supplied by the government will be purchased by the government; 10% of which will be sold to the government at cost, and 60% at cost plus a legal profit of 22%. Yarn and cloth made from domestically produced cotton may be bought and sold independently according to the third item.</p>
<p>(6) This method will be terminated when the market price of yarn and cloth is relatively stable.</p>
<p>After the chairman's report, the attending members discussed the new method in detail. The main opinions were summarized into three points: (1) Disagreement with the first item of the new method regarding the government's purchase of half of the spun cotton yarn and cloth. (2) The profit provisions in the second item of the new method will not be discussed for the time being. (3) Disagreement with the fifth item of the new method, insisting that the amount purchased by the government should not exceed 50%. It was also believed that if the new method was fully accepted, it would be tantamount to a bill of sale, and they would rather shut down completely than accept it casually.</p>
<p>However, the administrative authorities also have their own difficulties. That is, within six months after the new method is implemented and before the new cotton arrives, the government must purchase 33,000 bales of cotton yarn nationwide and 24,000 bales of cotton yarn in this city. Only by controlling the price with quantity can the effect of stabilizing the market price of yarn and cloth be achieved. Since the government has opened up foreign exchange for American cotton to supply private yarn factories with cheap raw materials, it should have the right to make reasonable purchases and coordinate distribution to increase the benefits of the general public.</p>
<h3>Fourth Round, Fourth Allocation of Yarn for Reproduced Goods Industry: Overdue and Not Yet Distributed</h3>
<p>The Fourth Round, Fourth Allocation of Yarn by the Yarn Allocation Committee of the Municipal Cotton Yarn Reproduced Goods Industry Association was originally scheduled by the Spinning and Weaving Control Committee to be reviewed and allocated on the 23rd of this month. However, the Sixth District Cotton Spinning Association failed to complete the procedures by the 23rd, resulting in no allocation. It was supposed to be handled on the 24th, but it was still not allocated yesterday afternoon. It is rumored that the Sixth District Association has petitioned for an adjustment of the negotiated price.</p>
<h3>Slight Drop in Oil Prices, Firm Rice Market</h3>
<p>The rice market saw a total arrival of over 12,000 stones from the north and south. Due to high prices in the interior, northern japonica rice was not profitable and the source was scarce, resulting in very little trading. Southern japonica rice was still available and the supply was normal, with transactions completed at the reviewed prices. White silver dollars were still rarely exchanged. There were no formal transactions for indica rice. Soybean prices fluctuated. Small black beans showed a slight increase. Northeastern soybeans fell back by over 1,000 yuan. The market for raw peanuts turned weaker outside the port, falling back by 2,000 to 3,000 yuan. Sesame fell by 1,000 yuan. Broad beans remained scarce and prices stable. The purchase of young corn stalks was strong, continuing to rise by over 1,000 yuan. Red sorghum prices rose by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan due to demand from wineries. The flour market accumulated a price increase of 500 yuan. Bran also rose by 100 to 200 yuan. The oil market turned weaker, with crude oil falling back by 3,000 to 4,000 yuan. Soybean oil remained flat. Sesame oil also fell slightly by 3,000 to 4,000 yuan. The sales of soybean cake turned weaker, with the price down by 200 to 300 yuan.</p>
<h3>Year-End Approaching, Increased Purchases: Prices of North and South Goods Rise</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] The recent rise in gold prices in the North and South goods industry has stimulated people's minds, with many purchasing for storage, and business is excellent. Marine products and imported goods have risen in price by 50% to 70%. In addition to the stimulus of gold prices, there is also the impact of talk about import restrictions. In fact, from January 5th next year, American ships will be carrying large quantities of marine products to Shanghai. The prices of northern goods have also risen by about 20% due to the stimulus of gold prices. Xu Boliang, the executive director of the South Goods Industry Association, told reporters that the prices of North and South goods have risen by an average of 4.3 times this year. Due to the current economic climate, the industry may have a slight surplus this year. The industry once experienced a labor strike during the year-end bonus period, but it was short-lived and resolved in one day. It has now been decided to issue an additional month's salary as a year-end bonus.</p>
<h3>Wavering Bullish Sentiment: General Decline in Yarn Prices</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the yarn market saw a continued sharp fall in gold prices. Bullish sentiment among people in the industry wavered, and they rushed to the market to sell, lowering prices to seek sales. The market was completely depleted. Customers also watched with folded arms due to tight funds. Prices of all kinds of yarn generally fell by 50,000 to 100,000 yuan, and the trend still seemed fragile.</p>
<h3>Slight Rebound in Sugar Prices</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market had already rebounded. The association's trading of spot raw sugar saw a slight increase of 3,000 to 4,000 yuan, raw brown sugar a slight increase of 10,000 yuan. Guang merchants offered over 200 bags of Runde green sugar at 127,000 to 128,000 yuan, up 2,000 to 3,000 yuan. Jian merchants' Diaoqing sugar was still firm due to scarcity, opening at 128,500 yuan, and Zhang red sugar at 142,000 yuan. Other sporadic transactions also saw a rebound.</p>
<h3>Tea Market Remains Quiet</h3>
<p>The local market for foreign firms' current year's new tea, which is sold at high prices, remains quiet. However, export firms recently plan to dabble in Wenzhou Xin Zhenmei tea. Unfortunately, since this type of tea was swept away by the Wuchang Tea Company some time ago, the stock is almost exhausted. Therefore, even if there is a small amount of inventory, the sellers are reluctant to part with it as it is rare, so transactions have not been concluded. On the other hand, the turnover of better quality old tea is not slow, and the process is firmer than before. The price of fried green rough tea also frequently tends upwards. The price of new Zhongmin fried tea has risen by 10,000 yuan to around 120,000 yuan per dan.</p>
<h3>Tianbao Feng Silver Shop Announces Liquidation</h3>
<p>Tianbao Feng Silver Shop, located at No. 437 Henan Road (intersection of Nanjing Road) in the city, yesterday entrusted lawyers Chen Xintian and Ma Shuyong to formally announce liquidation on the grounds that the shop's manager, Zou Renji, suddenly disappeared. All creditors and debtors are required to register within seven days from today, in order to be dealt with separately in accordance with the law.</p>
<h3>Coal Market Turns Soft</h3>
<p>The coal market for bituminous coal has become more relaxed recently as controls by the Management Committee have eased. Huainan coal and other types have continued to be transported from Nanjing, Zhenjiang, and other places. After purchasing allocated coal, various factories are also selling to the market at high prices to adjust their cash flow, so the market situation has gradually softened, and market prices are showing a slight decline. For anthracite coal, Qing Hongji lump coal is still firmly above the 1 million yuan peak. Jiaozuo coal and other types have seen a slight decline. Various coal ball manufacturers have reported that the market for anthracite coal dust is shrinking significantly. However, the owners are still trying to hold on, and the price is still outside the 400,000 yuan range.</p>
<h3>Tight Money Market: Problems with Exchange Occur Frequently</h3>
<p>In recent days, the price of gold has soared. Almost all capital in the city has been gambled in a last-ditch effort. After the Central Bank forcefully sold over 10,000 taels in the past two days, the money supply tightened by over 40 billion yuan. Therefore, yesterday, the money changers all felt the pressure of tight funds. There were many difficulties in balancing exchanges. Some sold gold to the Central Bank to make up for the deficit, but most did not have major problems.</p>
<h3>American Flour Arrives in Shanghai</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] The Lankatrin, managed by Jardine Matheson Foreign Department, arrived in port yesterday from Vancouver, carrying 6,000 tons of flour purchased by the China Trust Bureau.</p>
<h3>Silk Procurement Completed</h3>
<p>The China Trust Bureau has procured raw silk in seventeen batches, totaling 6,225 dan. Most of the spring silk has been delivered. However, among them, the fine striped spring silk (13/15 denier) was originally limited to 500 dan. The full amount has now been delivered. Because the manufacturers requested continued procurement, the China Trust Bureau has agreed. Yesterday, the bureau sent a letter to the China Silk Company, agreeing to continue procuring another 100 dan, with January 12, 1947, as the effective date. After receiving the letter, the China Silk Company will attach 40 dan to the eighteenth batch to be delivered within a few days. As for the autumn silk procurement, the cost verification issue is still awaiting approval from the Executive Yuan before it can begin.</p>
<h3>Yunnan Trade Association Cables Request to Save Economic Crisis</h3>
<p>[Report from our Kunming, 24th] The Yunnan branch of the Import and Export Trade Association believes that the high cost of exporting agricultural and mineral products due to transportation obstacles in Yunnan has greatly affected foreign trade. The economic crisis urgently needs to be saved. It has requested the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Economic Affairs to allow the continued use of the old "import and export linked method," whereby the amount of foreign exchange earned from Yunnan's exports can be used to purchase goods of equal value on the market, and to exempt restrictions on categories, in order to encourage exports with import profits.</p>
<h3>Tight Money, Falling Gold Prices: Chinese Stocks All See Low Prices</h3>
<p>Chinese stocks fell sharply yesterday with the price of gold. The market was incredibly tight and buyers were cautious. As soon as trading started, prices were low. Number 47, 100, 174, 218, 224 (永紗) were offered, but their price fell after they were opened, but in general the term trades rebounded due to numerous rollovers. Number 198 and 154 improved, term 永紗 once climbed past its opening price. Numbers 229, 215, 169 and 233 were offered, and the price of gold became more prominent, and investors were frighted. Term 永紗 fell to 650 yuan. Numbers 173 and 212 saw some bids which brought them to their morning opening prices, but due to the likelihood that gold would fall further, numbers 89, 88, 177, 76 and 61 were offered. While there was a minor rebound, there were still too many sellers and the money market became tight. Match Co stocks were first to hit limit down, and not long after so did 美亞. Close to noon they were at the lowest prices of the day before a slight afternoon rally. The result was that compared to yesterday, 永紗 and 新光 closed down 10 percent, 景編 and 華豐 down half of that, 美亞 and 動興 down 15 percent and Match Co and 內衣 cold stocks at limit down. After the afternoon open carrying over the closing momentum, there was a quick rush to improve prices. After term 永紗 opened high, 199, 169, 22, 151 and 97 all offered stock, and short 美亞s were again limit down and retreated to 640 yuan. Later, due to gold rallying again, 76, 152, 142 and 207 bid, gradually improving the term 永紗 price to 682 yuan. There was a rumor that 4 commercial banks will cease lending. Numbers 215, 14 and 97 sold, and the price fell again to 660 yuan. With the closing approaching, 永紗, 新光, and 華豐 fell half a percentage, 景福 slightly less, 美亞, 信和 and 勤興 fell 10%, Match Co and 麗安 cold stocks at limit down with others showing weakness. Week-over-week trading showed 永紗, 信和, and 華豐 fell slightly less than 10%, 景福 and 新光 falling slightly. Other stocks like Commercial Bank rose.</p>
<p>Foreign stocks also fell again due to the impact of gold, but with few trades and little strength. In the end, 怡紗, 英聯, 航業 and 紙業 fell 10%, 會德關業, 廣恰 and 啤 fell 5%, but 銅業 uniquely fell 15%.</p>

<h3>Ministry of Education Formally Abolishes National School Fund Incentive Law, to be Handled by Applying the Donations for Education Example</h3>
<p>[Report from our Nanjing, 24th] The Ministry of Education believes that the incentive measures for raising funds for national schools and township central national schools promulgated during the war are no longer applicable. The amount of incentives determined according to the living conditions in 1939 and 1940 is very small. If incentives are given according to this amount, it will not help the situation. If the amount is increased by a high multiple according to the current price situation, the government does not have such a large amount of dedicated funds. Therefore, it has formally abolished the measures.

Chen Linsheng (judge of this championship) of the Golden Dragon Table Tennis Team commented on the five group champions as follows:</p>
<p>Wang Youxin</p>
<p>Specializes in drawing, fast and powerful, both positive and negative are excellent, especially the backhand, fast shot, crisp and clean draw, good at running, is currently the best drawer in the table tennis world. His strong opponents are Xue Xuchu and Chuan Qifang. Xue Chuan has temporarily retired for some reason. Mr. Wang can be invincible, and it is not difficult to fulfill his long-cherished wish for the championship in this session.</p>
<p>Zhang Fuwei</p>
<p>Both drawing and cutting are long, and both are excellent. He is very serious during the game. He draws more than he cuts, especially the positive draw is powerful. He became famous earlier than Wang Youxin. Currently, his ball skills are slightly inferior. If he can be humble and not arrogant, he can compete with Youxin and Kaiyun.</p>
<p>Yang Kaiyun</p>
<p>Good at attacking, beautiful posture, very steady drawing, not good at back drawing, eats less, cutting is also good, but lacks spin. The advantage of being able to counter-attack when cutting, he does not practice often, and his ball skills have not regressed, he is also a genius.</p>
<p>Li Zhen</p>
<p>Proficient in cutting, not flashy, [blank] the ball high and low, fast and slow, can be handy, but the cut ball is quite high, easy for the opponent to draw, fortunately, relies on its tenacious nature to fight, often able to turn defeat into victory, calm attitude during the game, is his advantage.</p>
<p>Zhang Shanda</p>
<p>All-around attacker and defender, tall and thin, takes advantage of attacking. Zhang is a newcomer. He was included in the third group to compete this time, and he defeated the seeded Wu Zuochang, defeated the veteran Shui Hangao, and won the championship. It can be said that he made a splash. Zhang's rise is really the only gain of this cup competition.</p>

<h3>A Study on Christmas</h3>
<p>From the newspaper archives.</p>
<p>Every year on December 25th, the whole world celebrates to commemorate this great savior of humanity – Jesus.</p>
<p>In the Bible, there is a record about the birth of Jesus Christ:</p>
<p>Before Mary, the mother of Jesus, was married to Joseph, she suddenly became pregnant, which was caused by the Holy Spirit. When Joseph heard the news, although he was unwilling to humiliate her publicly, he was also unwilling to take her back as his wife. He secretly planned how to divorce his fiancée. While he was thinking, he suddenly had a dream that told him that his wife was pregnant because of the Holy Spirit. The child to be born would save the people and get them out of their sins. He is the savior of the nations of the world. He should take her as his wife without any more doubts. At the same time, he was told to name the child Jesus when he was born. After Joseph woke up, he did not doubt it at all, and followed the instructions in the dream to take Mary as his wife. But he did not consummate the marriage until the child in her womb was born.</p>
<p>Not long after Joseph and Mary got married, the governor Caesar Augustus suddenly issued an order, calling on the people of the world to return to their respective cities to register. The two of them also rushed from Nazareth in Galilee to Bethlehem, the city of David, to register. At that time, Mary was about to give birth. When they arrived in Bethlehem, they could not find an inn, so they stayed in a stable. Mary gave birth there, wrapped the newborn child in cloth, and placed him in a manger, naming him Jesus.</p>
<p>After Jesus was born, the wise men of the East saw the stars at night and came to find him. They found Mary and the child, knelt down to worship him, and offered gold, frankincense, and myrrh as gifts.</p>
<p>At that time, in the wilderness outside Bethlehem, there were large flocks of sheep guarded by shepherds, who took turns guarding them at night. One night, an angel suddenly descended, revealing a dazzling light, which frightened the shepherds. The angel said to the shepherds, "I am here to bring you good news. Do not be afraid. Today in the city of David, the Savior Christ of the nations of the world has been born. You will find a baby wrapped in cloth and lying in a manger. That is him." After saying this, a team of heavenly soldiers, surrounded by angels, ascended to heaven. In the clear sky with bright stars, it was vaguely possible to hear the sound of praising God.</p>
<p>Early the next morning, the shepherds followed the angel's words and rushed to Bethlehem, where they found Mary and Joseph, and saw the baby. The angel's words were confirmed. Soon, the news of the birth of the Savior Christ spread from the mouths of the shepherds throughout the city of David.</p>
<p>The above is the record in the Bible about the birth of Jesus, which does not specify the day on which Jesus was born. It is said that the day the shepherds came to bring good news was December 25, so this day was designated as Christmas, but this day is not the day Jesus Christ was born.</p>
<p>Regarding the date of Jesus' birth, there were several different sayings before the fifth century. One said it was January 6, another said it was March 25, and another said it was December 25. In the fourth century, the Romans decided to set December 25 as Christmas, and the date of Christmas was thus determined. In addition, there are two other textual researches: one said that the date of Jesus' birth should be calculated using the Hebrew calendar, which should be April 20. Another said that according to the Egyptian calendar, it should be May 20. It is difficult to say which calendar should be used to determine the original date of Jesus' birth. Even the year of Jesus' birth is still controversial. The earliest was Exgos, who estimated that his birth year was 753 in the Roman era, which is the Gregorian calendar that is currently used. However, later scholars believed that Exgos's estimate was wrong. It should be four or eight years before the AD. There are still disputes about the year of birth, so the date of birth is of course even more impossible to determine.</p>
<p>Since the legend of Christmas is not easy to determine, there is another more rounded saying, which is not based on historical research but is conjectured from the process of social evolution. Every winter, all European nations have a same festival season, where people celebrate wildly. Later, Christians used this festival to celebrate Christmas in order to replace the original [blank] medicine. Fortunately, most people are just having fun in the name of Christmas, and it seems insignificant what day Christmas should be. Therefore, in the customs of celebrating Christmas in Western countries, many ancient national festival pastimes can still be found.</p>

<h3>Christmas Food: Turkey</h3>
<p>Whenever there is a festival, there are always some seasonal foods. For example, rice dumplings for the Dragon Boat Festival and moon cakes for the Mid-Autumn Festival. As for the winter solstice, the Chinese usually grind flour to make rice cakes, while Westerners celebrate Christmas with turkey as an indispensable seasonal food. This is similar to the Chinese and Western ways, and it can be said that "every holiday season makes you think more about 'eating'."</p>
<p>Christmas is Near, Prices are High</p>
<p>Turkey is an indispensable dish in Christmas feasts, and its value is not less than our country's bird's nest and shark's fin. Turkey is also one of the gifts that people give each other. On the eve of Christmas, the price of turkey rises immediately, becoming "ten thousand times more expensive," and the poor can only drool at the windows. I remember last Christmas, there were not many turkeys in stock, the price was high, and it was not easy to buy. Smaller restaurants could not meet the market demand, so skillful chefs had to make fake turkeys out of chicken.</p>
<p>Let's first describe the beauty of the turkey:</p>
<p>The turkey is also called the tu hum chicken. It is tall, about three feet tall for the male and slightly smaller for the female. The upper beak has a caruncle, which can be stretched freely. When stretched, it is two or three inches long and hangs down under the mouth. The color is red and green, which is very pleasing to the eye. The "charming body" is too heavy, the movements are slow, the meat is very plump, and the taste is exceptionally beautiful.</p>
<p>Special Vessels Purchase Turkeys</p>
<p>In the United Kingdom, every year when Christmas is approaching, a large number of turkeys must be purchased from Southeastern Europe. Special vessels to Yugoslavia often number 150 to 200. Most of the turkeys in Shanghai come from Dinghai. Before the war, more than 30,000 turkeys were shipped from Dinghai every year. It is said that farmers in Dinghai started raising turkeys after the Opium War during the Daoguang period. The British occupied Dinghai, and there were many turkeys in the military camps. After the British army left Dinghai, they left the turkey breed. The local farmers thought that the turkey had a unique shape and full muscles, so they kept them and raised them. The output increased year by year, and it became a specialty of Dinghai.</p>
<p>Raising Turkeys is Not Easy</p>
<p>However, raising turkeys is not easy. After the turkeys hatch, the chicks are difficult to keep alive. They will die if they smell oily odors, which is much more difficult to raise than Chinese native chickens. Moreover, the best food for turkeys is grains, but due to economic reasons, the villagers mostly let them eat grass outside. Therefore, Chinese turkeys are not as big as American turkeys. American turkeys usually weigh more than 20 catties each, while Chinese turkeys weigh only more than 10 catties at most, and usually only four or five catties.</p>
<p>If we can use scientific methods to raise turkeys, and the government can provide convenience to marketers as much as possible, it will not be difficult to compete with imported products. I believe that this move will not only supplement the livelihood of farmers, but also promote domestic production and make up for loopholes. Why not encourage it!</p>
<h3>Christmas Tree</h3>
<p>When celebrating Christmas, a Christmas tree is an indispensable decoration, hung with lights and ribbons, creating a very beautiful atmosphere. Jesus often taught people to do good deeds and bear much fruit, so displaying this radiant tree during Christmas is in line with his teachings and carries profound meaning.</p>
<p>However, when it comes to the origin of the Christmas tree, it wasn't Christians who first came up with it. Its origin is debated, with various conflicting accounts.</p>
<p>Some say that Germans love outdoor life, so during their festivals, everyone would hang lights and ribbons in the forests, and men, women, old and young, would revel there. This was a way of celebrating. Later, other countries gradually followed this celebration method, and Christians also imitated this custom to celebrate the birth of Jesus. Some, because there were no forests nearby, would try to dig up a tree and carry it home, decorating it with lights and ribbons. Later generations continued this practice, calling it a Christmas tree.</p>
<p>Another account says that it was Saint Boniface who came up with it. Once, when he was cutting down a large oak tree in the forest, a gust of wind swept through, and all the trees were blown down, except for a small fir tree that stood firm. Saint Boniface then declared it a sacred tree. From then on, it was used as a decoration during Christmas.</p>
<p>Another story says that Martin Luther, wanting to show his children the scene of snowy trees under the starlight, cut down a small fir tree in the garden, placed it in the house, and lit candles on it. That day was the eve of Christmas, and later generations continued this custom.</p>
<p>Also, the holly used during Christmas has a very early origin. Ancient Romans used laurel branches as symbols of peace, victory, and happiness. Later, Christians followed this tradition, decorating windows with laurel branches. The English replaced laurel branches with holly, the meaning of which is: the white flowers of holly symbolize Christmas, the red berries symbolize the blood shed by Jesus for sinners, and the holly wreath represents the crown of thorns worn by Jesus during his crucifixion (From our Newspaper Archives)</p>

<h3>Deep into Tai Lake to Investigate Bandit Activity - An Interview with General Mao Sen</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent Wu Shouren</p>
<p>Suzhou, 16th</p>
<p>Since cracking the shocking nationwide kidnapping case of Rong Desheng, the "King of Flour," Major General Mao Sen's reputation has soared, becoming almost universally known. In September of this year, the Wuxi Command Post was established, and he was honored with the new appointment of Chief of Staff, taking on the heavy responsibility of ensuring the security of the Jiangnan region.</p>
<p>Major General Mao Sen Talks About the Great Jiangnan Suppression Campaign</p>
<p>At 2:30 PM on the 7th, the special car of the "Qiantang" brought Major General Mao from Wuxi to Suzhou. It was the reporter's first meeting with him. The first impression was of his forthrightness and sincerity. The second impression was that his short and stocky stature was not as imposing as I had imagined. His handsome face, accentuated by a straight nose, high cheekbones, and deep-set eyes, with thick, dark eyebrows, made his large eyes appear particularly spirited. His slightly pointed mouth and full forehead fully revealed that he was a capable man who was good at thinking and commanding.</p>
<p>Major General Mao Sen did not stay in the urban area of Suzhou. He only delayed for a few minutes for initial greetings and to state the request to follow him deep into the Tai Lake water area. The car immediately took us towards Mudu Town. The 27-mile road journey took 40 minutes. During this free time, the reporter had a wide-ranging conversation with Major General Mao. He cared about everything in Suzhou, such as the integrity of officials, military service, military discipline, and people's livelihoods, inquiring about them in detail. The reporter knew that Major General Mao was burdened with not only security responsibilities but also his original position. If a specific term had to be used to describe this original position, then the four characters "pacification and inspection" seemed appropriate. Because Major General Mao had the task of pacification and inspection, his inquiries were certainly not ordinary social pleasantries, nor did he expect to hear embellished praise, which can be asserted. Therefore, the reporter tried his best to concisely talk about the local situation as far as he knew. He expressed great surprise and concern about the trend of Suzhou's commercial economy nearing collapse. He paid particular attention to the fact that more than 300 grain businesses had closed down in the past three or four months. The reporter certainly would not give up this most opportune time to conduct an interview, so he raised many questions about the process of the Jiangnan suppression campaign and the security situation. Major General Mao, except for questions about figures because he did not have his files with him, answered very frankly. He stated with great certainty that there were no organized bandits in the Jiangnan area, and the scattered bandits on the run would not exceed 500 at most. To eliminate these approximately 500 scattered bandits, he planned to implement joint defense among the counties after the work in each suppression area was completed, intercepting and encircling them to thoroughly annihilate them. After concluding his answers, Major General Mao expressed his insightful views on the key points of pacification work, saying, "To thoroughly achieve the effectiveness of pacification, it is not possible to achieve complete success by relying solely on suppression forces. When I launched the great Jiangnan suppression campaign, I ordered the commanders of each suppression area to take appeasement as the first step in promoting the work. Secondly, strengthen local self-defense forces and improve the Baojia system in each county. These are measures that are above armed suppression." Indeed, "attacking the heart is paramount." If a broad people's movement can be launched in addition to suppression and appeasement, then the achievements of each suppression area will inevitably become greater and further lay the foundation for long-term stability in Jiangnan.</p>
<p>When the car arrived at Mudu Town, the sky was gloomy, and drizzling rain rose in the northwest wind. All the officers of the Tai Lake Suppression Command, except Commander Chuan Jingfang, who had gone to Zhangzhu in Yixing to concurrently serve as commander of the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui border suppression area, and Deputy Commander Liu Hongde, who was in Shanghai on official business, lined up at the bus station to welcome us, starting with Chief of Staff Yang Zheng. A large crowd of Mudu locals also gathered, their curious eyes flashing outside the temporary cordon, competing to admire Major General Mao Sen's demeanor. In the light rain, we walked towards the command post. This was an old residence located on East Street in Mudu, with very sturdy construction and very wide and deep houses, probably the former residence of local gentry. It was very clean and tidy, showing no signs of being used by a military organization. In the general office, the heads of each department presented their work reports separately. General Mao listened while flipping through the tables and forms, sometimes making concise inquiries, looking very relaxed and at ease while using his ears, eyes, and mouth simultaneously.</p>
<p>Scattered Bandits Re-emerge in the West China Peninsula</p>
<p>After nearly three months of combined suppression and appeasement in the Tai Lake area, the major bandit groups have either surrendered or been brought to justice. The only ones still resisting are the groups led by Xue Yonghui and Zhou Shiwei, as well as a small number of scattered bandits. The reason why they can reject appeasement and evade suppression, eking out a meager existence in a corner of rural Jiangnan, is that they indeed have some tricks for survival! After synthesizing the results of on-the-spot interviews with local elders, the reporter learned that their style is indeed very different from that of ordinary bandits. For example, Xue Yonghui claims to be the commander of the Tai Lake Military Region Advance Army of the Communist Party. During the War of Resistance, he used the restored West China Peninsula in the third district of Wuxi as his base. He has twenty or thirty henchmen, and they all adhere to the principle of "rabbits don't eat the grass near their own burrows." Although they kill, set fires, and rob far away, they do not commit any offenses against the residents of the West China Peninsula, where they are based. Therefore, the local people basically do not think of them as a gang of robbers. The assessment of land tax and other donations that they provide is considered by the people to be an inevitable and regular burden, and over time, they no longer see it as harsh. Under the foolish farmers' mistaken understanding that "soldiers and bandits are indistinguishable," they cleverly obtain safe protection, achieving their goal of survival. In October of this year, the suppression forces drove Xue Yonghui out of the West China Peninsula, turning him into a wandering vagrant living on boats on the shore of the lake, but according to recent confirmed information, Xue's troops have actually sneaked back into the Shanglangxiang village of the West China Peninsula and settled down. They have the ability to leave before the suppression troops arrive and then return after the suppression troops retreat! The reporter has questioned the cadres of the command headquarters about the formation of this situation. They all believe that if we can spread the power of propaganda and deepen the distinction between good and evil among the people, we believe that the bandits' skills in survival will inevitably lose their effect. Now, the Tai Lake Command Headquarters is preparing to start from this path. The reporter would like to appeal to Major General Mao Sen to give more instructions and assistance!</p>
<p>After listening to the work report, it was already past four o'clock.</p>
<p>Surrendered Troops Live in Bitter Cold</p>
<p>The rain fell harder and harder, and the sky became even gloomier. Major General Mao began inspecting the general conditions of the surrendered troops, which was the most important task of his special trip to Mudu. There were two provisional independent teams concentrated in Mudu, and another independent team was concentrated in Shanren Bridge for training. The first place we went was the barracks of Xu Jintang's battalion of the Third Independent Team. Thirty-one cadres, except for one left to serve as a guard, had all been ordered to gather in the barracks of the First Team to await instructions. What surprised the reporter was that in such cold weather, their bedding consisted only of two military blankets and a straw mat woven from rice straw, laid on the stone bricks of a large hall. Major General Mao was also saddened by this impression. He estimated the thickness of the military blankets with his fingers and repeatedly said that the equipment must be improved immediately. As for the soldier on guard duty, he had no uniform, only a short padded jacket and trousers, standing shivering in the west wind, reminding people of the arduous battles of our guerrilla forces during the War of Resistance! The barracks of the First Team were in a large rice threshing floor on Xiatang Street in Mudu. The low houses were close to collapsing, and the light was so dark that you couldn't see your fingers. There were 116 men in Liao Bingnan's unit, and they all had an old military uniform to wear, but it was also very thin. However, the 30 men under Xu Jintang, although they had no uniforms, wore padded robes and jackets that were quite neat and seemed warm. More than 140 stalwart men from the wilderness were lined up on the open field in the oblique wind and rain, each with a solemn face, overflowing with the joy of abandoning evil and embracing a new life! Major General Mao saw that the raindrops were falling harder and harder. He ordered Zhang Heqing, the instructor in charge of supervision and training, to change the route and gather the troops in the nearby Chenghuang Temple, while he first inspected the entire barracks. The so-called barracks were very pitiful, completely empty small rice warehouses with walls made of yellow mud and partitions made of reed mats. The soldiers' bedding did not even have straw mats, only two military blankets, one as a mattress and one as a quilt. The food was considered three meals, one congee and two rice, with 24 taels of rice and 250 yuan of non-staple food per person per day. When Major General Mao inspected the kitchen, he carefully observed the rice in the pot and the vegetables in the bucket, feeling that there was enough rice but too little vegetables.</p>
<p>Walking into the Chenghuang Temple, the dilapidated corridors still retained traces of the great fire of Mudu that year. The sky was already twilight. The stalwart men waited solemnly in the newly built main hall. Under the dim light of the flickering red candles, only a dark group could be seen, truly rich in the meaning of a gathering in an ancient temple! The reporter initially thought that Major General Mao would only give an earnest speech, but he didn't know that he would meticulously call out names and talk to each person according to the roster. The first to be called was Zeng Jilun, the deputy commander of the First Team (commander Liao Bingnan was on leave), a short, fat, and solid figure with a very fair complexion, with none of the coarse habits that we imagined he should have. He frankly stated the unanimous pain of his subordinates, which was that it was too cold at night, and he also hoped to increase the non-staple food allowance. He reported on the daily education and training schedule, which was to get up at 6:00 AM to carry out fitness exercises such as climbing mountains, running, and gymnastics. After breakfast at 9:00 AM, they would tidy up their internal affairs and go to the lecture hall. The afternoon courses focused on academic studies. The individual inquiries of the 134 stalwart men who actually attended the training took more than three hours. The reporter stood next to Mao, listening to the endless sound of eaves water dripping in the wide courtyard, his mood gradually becoming anxious. Leaving Suzhou in a hurry, without preparing rain gear, he would have to turn into a drowned chicken if he ran back to the command headquarters.</p>
<p>After the instructions were completed, fortunately, the sound of rain from the eaves had stopped. The rainy night in the countryside was particularly dark, almost to the extent that you couldn't see your fingers. Relying on the flickering flashlight, we stumbled back to the command headquarters, one foot high and one foot low. Thanks to Director Yang, a room was specially vacated for the reporter in the guesthouse, opposite Major General Mao's bedroom. After dinner, Major General Mao summoned the members of the disciplinary team for individual talks. This group of young partners, led by a female captain, Zhang Ximing, was the only direct force of the Tai Lake Command Headquarters. At about 11 o'clock, Deputy Commander Colonel Liu Hongde happened to return to Suzhou from Shanghai and rushed to Mudu that night after hearing the news. Colonel Liu, who is now fully responsible for the Tai Lake suppression campaign, is a stalwart and forthright young soldier. The reporter had a brief meeting with him, and he was busy going to see Chief of Staff Mao and did not talk much.</p>
<p>Tai Lake Remains the Same - Many Sailboats Come and Go</p>
<p>The night in the countryside was very peaceful. When I woke up in the morning, the rising sun reflected on the high walls, and the sky was already clear. The orderly said that Chief of Staff Mao had not rested until 5:00 AM and got up early to inspect the cleanliness of the toilets. The reporter couldn't help but admire his tireless and meticulous spirit. After washing up, his mind had flown to the vast Tai Lake. The reporter had been away from Tai Lake, which irrigates three provinces, for a long time. He wondered what the recent situation was like. Thinking that he would soon see it again and appreciate the endless scenery, he was very excited. Who knew that just after finishing breakfast, a long-distance call came from the Wuxi Command Post, reporting a major explosion at the Jiangwan Arsenal. General Tang Enbo ordered Mao Sen to rush to Shanghai to investigate. He had no choice but to cancel his plan to go deep into Tai Lake. However, although we did not go deep into Tai Lake, we still went to Xukou on the edge of Tai Lake to overlook the situation of Tai Lake, which can be regarded as "consoling ourselves rather than nothing"!</p>
<p>Tai Lake looks particularly quiet and beautiful in the morning sun. In the distance, several heavily loaded sailboats are sailing along the shoreline where the sky and water meet. The freight transport of Tai Lake has not disappeared after all. Limited by time, we could not stay for long. At 12:30 PM, the car took us back to Suzhou, and Chief of Staff Mao rushed to catch the "Qiantang" going downstream. A new task is being added to his shoulders. We shook hands tightly in farewell.</p>
<h3>Santa Claus</h3>
<p>Our Newspaper Archives</p>
<p>The arrival of Christmas, even if no one tells you, you will know.</p>
<p>Walking onto the street, the first impression is that the shop windows on both sides are obviously different from usual.</p>
<p>Inside the long and short, large and small windows, almost all stand a Santa Claus. Although their faces are not exactly the same, they all have long beards, wear red clothes, have white cotton scattered on their bodies, and carry a large package on their backs.</p>
<p>What does Santa Claus carry? In the candy store, he carries cakes and chocolates; in the toy store, he carries small trains and small boats; in the shoe store, he carries a large bag of small leather shoes; in the hat store, he carries a large stack of red and green hats.</p>
<p>The origin of Santa Claus, it is said, began in the extremely cold area of ​​Northern Europe. The Teutonic people had a children's god named St. Nicholas. Later, it was spread to the United States and called Santa Claus. We Chinese call him Santa Claus. Legend has it that he is amiable and especially likes children. Every winter, he must prepare many gifts and personally give them to the children, especially paying attention to the poor children. Later, because the actions of the old man coincided with the spirit of Christ's love for others as himself, Christians adopted this story every Christmas, on the one hand, so that ordinary Christians could do some good deeds, and on the other hand, to encourage children to improve and learn the spirit of broad acceptance.</p>
<p>The task of this Santa Claus: is to carry such a large package, and in the early morning of Christmas, when everyone has not yet gotten up, quietly slip down from the chimney and stuff the gifts in the package into the socks hanging in front of the bed.</p>
<p>Speaking of the origin of chimneys and socks, it is also very interesting. It turns out that the British have long had a custom similar to our country's cleaning of dust at the end of the year. Before the New Year, they must clean the chimney so that good luck for the coming year can come in. I don't know how, but Santa Claus has changed to coming down from the chimney. Hanging socks was thought of by the British and Americans. At first, Dutch children put their shoes by the stove. It is said that Santa Claus must see the shoes placed there properly before putting the gifts in them. Presumably the British and American children are smarter and changed to using socks, because the socks can be stretched open and have a much larger capacity, so you can put more things in them.</p>

<h3>The First Voice of World Cultural Revival</h3>
<p>— Our Special Correspondent Hong Fu</p>
<p>Paris, 7th (Airmail)</p>
<p>After the end of World War II, world culture suddenly encountered an opportunity for revival. A new movement is underway, and the trend is rapidly changing, as seen at the "First General Conference of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization." This conference was held from November to December 1946 and was created by a special meeting of representatives from 44 countries in November 1945. The rules of procedure for the General Conference were approved by the Executive Committee of the Organization at its meeting on August 19. Article 33 of the rules stipulates that printed materials are still in English and French, but the languages that can be used for legal resolutions are predetermined to be English, Russian, French, Chinese, and Spanish. The Chinese language occupying a superior position in the international arena is probably the first time ever.</p>
<p>The "United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization" is the key to preventing war and cultivating peace. If people today want to seek happiness for the future of the world, the difficulty of their undertaking is like building a huge mansion. The important institutions that the United Nations has already established, such as the Health Bureau, the Labor Bureau, the Finance Bureau, the Economic and Social Agricultural and Food Bureau, and the five combined, are like five major pillars, and the Scientific and Educational Association is the great foundation that bears everything.</p>
<p>The agenda of the Scientific and Educational Association is divided into six sections: (1) Education Section. (2) Creative Arts Section, which is in charge of sculptures, paintings, script writing, architecture, design, and other items. (3) Science Section. (4) Social Science Section, which is related to philosophy and the social well-being of humanitarians. (5) Museum Section, which is in charge of all museums that collect historical souvenirs, libraries that collect printed materials, and archives that collect anecdotes and documents. (6) Publicity Section, which is in charge of in-depth public undertakings such as movies, broadcasts, and news. The Chinese representatives to this conference are Zhao Yuanren, Li Shuhua, Cheng Tianfang, Chen Yuan, and Zhu Kezhen. On the second day of the opening, representatives from China and other seven countries were elected as vice-presidents of the conference. When the names were called, English, American, and Chinese were broadcasted together, which is another clear proof that China's international status has been particularly enhanced after the war.</p>
<h3>Tracing the Origins of Bloodlines: China and Siam are One Family</h3>
<p>— Xu Songshi</p>
<p>Prior to the mid-13th century AD, when the Sukotai Dynasty was established, the Kingdom of Siam did not possess accurate national history. Therefore, most Siamese people are largely unaware of the origins of their ancestors.</p>
<p>Siamese Ancestors Were Originally Indigenous to China</p>
<p>In recent years, several Western scholars have affirmed that the ancestors of the entire Siamese nation came from China. Among these scholars, one of the most famous is Professor T. de Lacouperie of a British university. He stated that the ancient Siamese originated from the mountainous regions bordering Henan, Hubei, and Anhui provinces in China, and the Youchao clan was their tribe. One branch migrated westward, passing through the Jiulong Mountains bordering Shaanxi and Sichuan, then turning southward, traversing Sichuan, Guizhou, Yunnan, and reaching the Shan states and the Kingdom of Siam. Today, the Siamese people's preference for living in elevated wooden houses is a continuation of their nest-dwelling habits. French scholar E. Aymonier pointed to Yunnan and Kham as the origin of the Siamese race. British scholar F. Garnier stated that the Siamese race originated in South China.</p>
<p>The Largest Tribe, Known as the Big Tai and Little Tai</p>
<p>In recent years, the author has been deeply interested in the history of the Siamese nation. Based on personal research, it has been proven that the entire Siamese race are descendants of the broader Han Chinese race, and the Han Chinese originally originated in China, not from the West. As early as four thousand years ago, the ancestors of the Siamese lived south of the Yangtze and Huai Rivers in our country, belonging to the same tribe as the Jing and Shu of the early Zhou Dynasty, naturally a branch of the broader Han Chinese race. Later, the so-called Chu, Wu, Yue, Min, and Yue tribes were evidently of the same bloodline as the Siamese race.</p>
<p>The Siamese have always referred to themselves as the Little Tai people (Tai Nysi), while referring to the Lao people (Laos) in the north as the Big Tai people (Tai Noi). These two ethnic groups are the largest tribes in the Kingdom of Siam, with similar languages and customs. In addition, there are the Shan people, concentrated in the northwestern part of the Kingdom of Siam, also belonging to the Big Tai designation. In fact, the ancestors of the Shan people were the Wuhu people of Lingnan during the Zhou and Qin dynasties, who migrated earliest from Lingnan. As early as 500 BC, their vanguard had reached the Salween River basin. The ancestors of the Lao people were the Southwestern Yi people of Zhennan in Guizhou during the Western Han Dynasty, also known as the Zangke Liao (the words Liao and Lao have the same pronunciation). Meng Huo was their most famous chieftain. From the Shu Han to the Tang Dynasty, they migrated into Siamese territory in large numbers. During the Tang and Song dynasties, they were deeply dominated by the Nanzhao and Dali kingdoms. The Luohu Kingdom of the Yuan Dynasty was established by these Lao people.</p>
<p>The Siamese Kingdom of the Yuan Dynasty - Actually Descended from the Chimei</p>
<p>As for the Siamese Kingdom of the Yuan Dynasty, according to the "Continuation of the Comprehensive Examination of Documents," it was said to be descended from the Chimei (Red Eyebrows). The author has definitively proven that Chimei is a transliteration of Jingmei. Those who established this Siamese kingdom were the Siamese people, known as the Little Tai. During the Zhizheng period of the Yuan Dynasty, Siam and Luohu merged into one, which continues to this day. The name Siam originated from this. This Tai race is slightly different from the Lao and Shan races. This is because the ancestors of the Siamese race came directly from the northern part of Qinzhou in Guangdong and the southwestern part of Guangxi, namely the ancient Xiyuan, Guangyuan, and Huangdong, etc., starting in the Tang and Song dynasties. Moreover, we have many reasons to believe that those who initially held the reins of the Siamese kingdom were descendants of Nong Zhigao, the King of Dainan, who was defeated by Di Qing of the Song Dynasty. These Siamese people are the most intelligent and powerful part of the three major races in today's Kingdom of Siam: Siamese, Lao, and Shan. Their relationship with the Han Chinese can be described as even closer.</p>
<p>The Li and Tong People - Of the Same Bloodline as the Siamese</p>
<p>The Li people of Hainan Island in Guangdong today are undoubtedly of the same system as the Siamese. The Tong people (formerly written as Tong, pronounced as Zhuang) in the western and northern parts of Guangxi today are basically identical to the Siamese. The Gejia people of Guizhou and the Buyi people of Yunnan also belong to the same race as the Siamese. The author randomly selected 120 words from the Siamese language and compared them with the Tong language, and only thirteen were not very similar. In Ningming, Baise, Longzhou, and other places, Tong people with radios can listen to broadcasts from Bangkok, the capital of Siam, without any barrier. The names of Siamese villages, as well as living customs, etc., are almost identical to those of the more than four million Tong people in Guangxi province, which is a very interesting phenomenon. It should be known that the Tong people are an excellent ethnic group in the southwestern border region of our country. Famous generals such as Shi Dakai and Wei Changhui were all Tong people. Moreover, the so-called Baiyue people in ancient times were the Tong race. Currently, the Cantonese language still retains many phonetic elements of the Tong and Siamese languages. Calling water chestnuts "ma ti," pomelos "bok liu," and New Year's cake "da long gao" are completely Siamese and Tong words. The characters "Daliang" in Shunde, Guangdong, mean "Yellow Race Land" in Siamese. If we say that the ancient tribes of Jing, Man, Chu, Wu, Yue, Min, Yue, Li, and Tong are Han Chinese, then we absolutely cannot deny that the Siamese race are descendants of the ancient Han Chinese.</p>
<p>Monosyllabic Languages - Extremely Similar to Chinese</p>
<p>The Siamese people previously had a language but no script. At the end of the Yuan Dynasty, they began to use Indian Pali letters to spell out the Siamese language. Today, the Siamese language is still a monosyllabic language, with level, rising, departing, and entering tones. Many word sounds are the same as Chinese word sounds. Calling "two" "shuang," "eat" "geng," "heaven" "min," "wine" "lao," "die" "dai," and "house" "lan," these word sounds closely resemble ancient Chinese meanings. The Siamese language is so closely related to the Chinese language that we can only regard it as a dialect of the Chinese language. Undoubtedly, the Siamese compatriots are of our Han Chinese bloodline.</p>
<p>Recently, Siamese elder Nai Biri came to China for a visit. It was reported that the Siamese Ambassador Nai Shawan Dula Dao will soon present his credentials in Nanjing. We hope that these two "Nai" (the word "Nai" in Siamese is equivalent to the Chinese word "Jun" or "Mister") can truly recognize that China and Siam are one family, truly understand the history of China and Siam, and make more enthusiastic progress in the relationship between the two countries!</p>

<h3>Diplomacy: Then and Now</h3>
<p>— Yun, from the New York Times</p>
<p>A Good Show Keeps Evolving / From Full-Scale Martial Arts / To Changing Styles Now</p>
<p>A good quarter of a century has passed, from the Versailles Peace Conference in 1919 to today's conference at Villa d'Este. Sitting in boxes drawn by cartoonists, we have witnessed the performance of international diplomacy. It is a continuous good show that constantly evolves: the diplomatic figures and their methods, the attire and the drama, the atmosphere of the stage, and the length of the plot - everything has changed.</p>
<p>Of course, some traditions have endured, such as the scolding and quarrels that have enlivened the conference hall since this war, which are indeed the unadulterated classical style of seeking peace. Whenever a war subsides, diplomats seem to regard banging stools and tables at home as a necessary means of negotiating peace with the enemy. In fact, sometimes they even go a little too far.</p>
<p>In the Palace of Versailles after World War I, British Prime Minister Lloyd George, with his anger rising to his head, felt he had to grab French Prime Minister Clemenceau's formal coat collar and demand an apology for the insults he had received. At the Lausanne Conference in 1922, Turkish representative Dr. Rıza Nur leaped across the green baize table and grabbed Greek Prime Minister Venizelos's throat, only releasing him when the Prime Minister's face turned blue.</p>
<p>As far as the world knows, no similar situations have occurred at conferences held in London, Paris, San Francisco, or New York since this war. The new style is no longer like that, replaced by verbal attacks, and physical beatings are no longer used.</p>
<p>Formal Dress is a Thing of the Past</p>
<p>Since the diplomatic figures themselves have undergone the aforementioned changes, the clothes they wear have naturally changed as well. Twenty-five years ago, when we stepped into the First Peace Conference hall, even as mere observers, we had to wear striped trousers, black morning dress, and a black Homburg hat, full of dignity. It seemed that everyone who had a hint of diplomatic flavor had to dress as neatly as the diplomats engaged in it. But today, this Edwardian-style coat has become a symbol of diplomatic antiques. Young politicians are ashamed to touch it again; they prefer to discuss world affairs in informal jackets and trousers. At the opening of the United Nations General Assembly in New York this time, there was a similar</p>
<p>The Diplomacy of 1919 was a Full-Scale Martial Art / Lloyd George's Liver Fire Rises, Grabbing Clemenceau's Collar / Feeling He Must Apologize for the Insults He Received.</p>
<p>The Diplomacy of 1946 is a Kissing Style / Bevin and Molotov No Longer Use Physical Beatings / But Replace Them with Verbal Attacks. Only one regulation of the old form remains: to wear a proper dark-colored coat, but it is no longer necessary to wear morning dress, and this requirement is still for the interpreters, not the representatives themselves.</p>
<p>There have also been changes in diplomatic language. In the entire 18th century and part of the 19th century, there was only one diplomatic language: French. Professional diplomats were required to conduct business in French. But at the Versailles Conference, two tycoons, Wilson and Lloyd George, knew nothing of French, while the French old man Clemenceau spoke English fluently. Whenever he was happy to do so, this Tiger Prime Minister would immediately jump over the barriers of diplomatic convention and use the rough side of his language to his colleagues, speaking in English that all three could immediately understand.</p>
<p>Diplomatic Language Changes</p>
<p>Today, putting a microphone on the conference table has brought about a tremendous change in diplomatic language. Sometimes what a representative says is the same as what he says to his own people; he says it that way and hopes that people in the conference hall can understand it. There is another reason for this: every representative believes that his national language is no less important than any other country's, and for the prestige of his country, he hopes to use his national language fluently. Although this requirement cannot be satisfied without limit, the United Nations today already has five official languages: Chinese, French, English, Spanish, and Russian. National prestige is won, and five hundred people waste time simultaneously.</p>
<p>Finally, there is one more change to mention, which is that today the diplomatic world still has an order of seniority in the driving of vehicles and the seating at banquets, but the actions of diplomats reflect the opposite of the importance they occupy. The higher the position, the harder the work. Only after each banquet, the order of leaving the table and returning to the studio is arranged according to the level of status: first the Foreign Minister, then the Ambassador, and then the Minister Plenipotentiary. Chargé d'affaires and assistants lazily follow back to the piles of documents and conference seats after watching all these people leave.</p>
<p>Diplomacy today has indeed become a more cumbersome job than before.</p>
<p>Current Affairs Commentary</p>
<h3>The Center of the World Situation Shifts to the Far East / White Development of Asia is a Thing of the Past</h3>
<p>— Chu Yukun</p>
<p>Since the Four Foreign Ministers Conference and the United Nations General Assembly have successively closed, 1946 has finally achieved a peaceful ending; the efforts of politicians and diplomats from various countries throughout the year have not been in vain, and the achievements of these two international conferences are indeed rare successes in previous international conferences. Therefore, after returning to their respective countries, politicians and diplomats from various countries have successively made speeches, praising the significant achievements of the Four Foreign Ministers Conference and the United Nations General Assembly. Everyone places their hope for the future development of the world political situation in 1947. First, on February 20 next year, the peace treaties with Italy, Romania, Hungary, Bulgaria, and Finland can be signed in Paris, and these five vassals of Nazi Germany can also return to normal and become member states of the United Nations; second, on March 20 next year, the Four Foreign Ministers will hold another meeting in Moscow to discuss the peace treaties with Germany and Austria. The world is moving towards peace step by step, which is indeed optimistic, and it is believed that the future of the world will have unlimited hope.</p>
<p>The Situation Improves / What About the Far East?</p>
<p>Since the overall situation in the world has improved, it is not impossible for the great powers to cooperate and jointly create world peace, so the Far East situation also has the hope of becoming brighter with the improvement of the world situation. But the current Far East is indeed the worst part of the world. For example, although China is one of the five powers, the failure to resolve the KMT-CPC problem has resulted in the entire country being shrouded in the flames of civil war. In addition, Indonesia, Vietnam, and Burma are all brewing independence movements, and blood is shed there every day, especially in Vietnam, which almost puts the entire Republic of Vietnam in complete turmoil. Moreover, the French government authorities not only handle this improperly, but also have not abandoned their past approach to the colonies. Therefore, the Vietnam issue is even more difficult to resolve. Vietnam has appealed to the United States and China to come forward and mediate. If the French Socialist Party cabinet cannot make a clear decision, even if the United States and China mediate, it will be useless. We want to tell France that the era of white development of Asia has passed. As stated in the New York Minsheng Forum,</p>
<p>The United States Reaffirms Its China Policy</p>
<p>In the past six months, there have been places in the United States that have requested the government authorities to reconsider their China policy, and there have also been places in China that have misunderstood the United States' policy. Therefore, President Truman's reiteration of the China policy is very necessary. President Truman finally issued a lengthy speech on the 18th of this month, reiterating that the United States' China policy remains unchanged, and the China policy issued on December 15 of last year remains effective; and solemnly declared the following items.</p>
<p>(1) The US military is stationed in China at the request of the National Government to assist China in repatriating Japanese residents and prisoners of war, as well as restoring domestic peace and order in China. The number of US troops has been reduced from 113,000 to 12,000. (2) Recognize China as an autonomous and independent country, and recognize the National Government as the sole legal government of China; (3) The United States</p>
<h3>The World of Women</h3>
<p>Does the world today belong to men? To this question, our answer is "no." Taking the United States, the most advanced country in the world, as an example, according to statistics from the country's Department of Commerce, women spend 85 percent of the hard-earned money of the country's salaried class. The Federal Census Bureau announces that the average life expectancy of American women is four years longer than that of men.</p>
<p>The nurse in charge of medical examinations at the State University Health Clinic in San Jose, California, made a record of students' reactions to various vaccinations and serum injections, proving that 45 percent more men than women have weak knees when seeing needles.</p>
<p>The US Public Health Service investigated the number of pneumonia cases. The report says that 55 percent of patients with the disease are men. Clerks at the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company revealed that more men than women have appendicitis surgery, and the American Medical Association also tells us that significantly more men than women develop hardening of the arteries.</p>
<p>The American Optical Company in Southbridge, Massachusetts, studied the prevalence of color blindness among Americans and found that 90 percent of color-blind people in the country are men.</p>
<p>A water safety officer in Los Angeles analyzed 2,800 lives saved on the beach over a decade and was surprised to learn that male swimmers accounted for 70 percent of all accidents.</p>
<p>A professor at Syracuse University estimates that 1 percent of Americans stutter, and men account for 75 percent of those who stutter.</p>
<p>Even the gods seem to trouble men, as a London insurance company employee specializing in accident statistics discovered that 87 percent of people killed by lightning strikes are also men.</p>
<h3>Trivia</h3>
<p>— Wu Pengming</p>
<p>The US Department of Commerce recently reported an interesting fact: Infantrymen sent overseas during the war used two types of pills to prevent seasickness, one containing the active ingredient "Hainei Xing" and the other containing only white sugar as a psychological treatment. At sea with mild waves, 20 percent of those who took white sugar still got seasick, eight times more than those who took "Hainei Xing" and still got seasick. At sea with treacherous waves, the seasickness situation with these two types of pills was almost the same.</p>
<h3>The Wonder of Christmas: Why is it Mysterious?</h3>
<p>— Translated by Yunbei from Kaufman's "Christmas in Maine"</p>
<p>Everyone Does the Same Thing at the Same Time</p>
<p>It is most appropriate to observe the characteristics of Western nations from the customs of Christmas. Because this is a holiday that includes three qualities: first, it has a strong religious meaning; second, it belongs to the joy of families and children; third, it is everyone's annual excuse for gluttony. Appropriate for this publication's issue coinciding with this year's Christmas, a section describing the holiday is selected and translated as follows;</p>
<p>"If you also want to have a happy Christmas, like the one I once spent in Paradise Meadow as a child,... you must have a clear December night, with the blue stars of Maine sparkling like sapphires, surrounding the moon that shines brightly on the earth. At this time, light up all the lights on the branches piled with fake snow, and they will sparkle like shattered diamonds... You can also fill this Meadow House with myrtle trees, hanging clusters of blue jewels on them,... or hang rose fruits on pine needles. Clusters of currant fruits are piled up, and gingerbread has also been placed in the appropriate place.</p>
<p>In addition, it is best to have an aunt beside you. She believes that herbal tea and the Bible are two things that must be prepared for children, so she opens the Bible and reads the story of Christ's birth aloud to the whole family. Of course, a Christmas tree is even more indispensable. This tree must be tall enough so that its branches can turn along the ceiling of the sitting room, presenting the shape of an old fan opening. You can wait until the morning of that day to bring it home on a sled.</p>
<p>Uncles and aunts are all at home, and there are even more cousins, truly a cartload. At this time, your whole nation is playing this and playing that at home. The element of the most fulfilling Christmas is that everyone is doing the same thing at the same time.</p>

Although the Outbreak of War Stopped People's Permissible Things, The "Mobile Car House" Business Has Not Stopped, and There Has Been Special Progress in Design. Because the "Housing Problem" Needs It! Many Places Where Public or Construction Projects are Carried Out Also Often Have Many Such "Villages" Existing. A Rural Police Officer Also Needs to Take It to the Countryside. City Hospitals Need It Even More to Take Patients on Trips. During the War, This "Car House" Was Still a Composite Product of Wooden Materials Such as Board and Wood and Steel Frames, Usually Nine Feet Wide and Twenty-Two Feet Long, Weighing Around Two Thousand Eight Hundred Pounds.</p>

<h3>The Real Mastermind Behind the Yunnan Uprising</h3>
<p>— Lu Danlin</p>
<p>During the National Protection War, the Yunnan Uprising aimed to overthrow Yuan Shikai's betrayal of the country. However, for the past thirty-one years, a true assessment of its primary driving force has been lacking. Historical accounts have left the public in a state of confused uncertainty. Kang Youwei claimed, "I instructed Liang Qichao to carry out the Yunnan Uprising." Liang Qichao, however, stated, "I instructed Cai E to carry out the Yunnan Uprising!" Moreover, Liang Qichao's writings, such as "Bi Dun Ji" and "Gong Zhan Tan," extensively glorified his own achievements and those of the Progressive Party. Naturally, this was a political tactic and a maneuver by politicians. Nevertheless, some people were misled by them. Even middle and primary school textbooks primarily highlighted Cai E's achievements while dismissing the initiative of the Chinese Revolutionary Party (from the Tongmenghui to the Kuomintang). This is confusing right and wrong, inverting black and white. A clear clarification is needed in party history, National Protection War history, and modern history to provide a correct understanding for our study of the political history of the Republic of China.</p>
<p>The backbone of the Progressive Party was Liang Qichao, and both Liang Qichao and Kang Youwei were key figures in the Constitutionalist Party. Sun Yat-sen stated in Chapter 8 of Psychological Reconstruction of The Plans for National Reconstruction: "At that time, the Constitutionalist Party emerged, acting as accomplices for the tiger. Their opposition to revolution and the republic was even more severe than that of the Qing court." The irreconcilable relationship between Liang Qichao and the revolutionary party was a fact, and the Progressive Party pledged allegiance to Yuan Shikai while excluding the revolutionary party. In the early years of the Republic of China, this was also a prominent reality. When Yuan usurped power, Liang Qichao opposed the imperial system. Superficially, this was Liang's clever move, but the underlying truth involved political motives. However, since Liang opposed Yuan, the people of the country naturally held him in considerable admiration. Because the National Protection War against Yuan was not solely managed by the revolutionary party. But there must absolutely not be any covering up of the eyes and ears of the people of the world, seizing the credit of the world, and using it for personal or factional glorification.</p>
<p>Around the time of the Second Revolution, many Kuomintang members suffered from Yuan Shikai's expulsion, arrest, and killing. Aside from those who fled overseas or went underground to organize, some revolutionary comrades had different perspectives and took separate paths. Others took advantage of Yunnan's inconvenient transportation and Yuan's limited actual control. Tang Jiyao had his own ambitions and treated them well, either assigning them to civil positions, involving them in behind-the-scenes activities, employing them as instructors at the military academy, or providing them with military training. In southern Yunnan, the revolutionary spirit was exceptionally united in preparation for any eventuality. On April 8th of the Republic of China’s year, the Song An assassination occurred, further exposing Yuan Shikai's treacherous schemes. At that time, Sun Yat-sen resided in Tokyo, personally maintaining the work of the Chinese Revolutionary Party. Realizing that Yuan was betraying the Republic of China, he immediately initiated plans for uprisings in various regions, specifically dispatching Ju Zheng to Shandong, Zhu Zhixin back to Guangdong, Chen Qimei to Shanghai, Yu Youren to Shaanxi, and Lu Zhiyi back to Yunnan to engage in planning activities to overthrow Yuan. Ju and others followed orders and made arrangements accordingly. Lu returned to Yunnan from Japan and secretly organized. Upon arriving in Kunming, the provincial governor, Ren Kezheng, immediately received a telegram from the Beijing Headquarters, ordering Lu's detention in the police station. Lu sent messages to comrades Deng Taizhong and Yang Qin for assistance. Deng and Yang went to the police station and took Lu to see Tang Jiyao. Tang asked Lu to stay at Deng Taizhong's home, allowing him to interact with Fan Guofan, Li Zhisheng, Hong Xun, and others. He also secretly discussed with high-ranking generals such as Luo Peijin, Huang Yucheng, Zhang Kairu, and Ye Quan, and they decided on four measures: 1. If Tang Jiyao opposed the imperial system, he would still be promoted as the leader. 2. If Tang remained neutral, he would be respectfully sent out of the country. 3. If Tang supported the imperial system, he would be killed. 4. If the second or third options were implemented, Luo Peijin would be supported as the leader. Deng and Yang also took the opportunity to inquire about Tang's true attitude. Tang indicated that such a major decision required a majority vote. At that time, Yuan sent special envoys Jiang and He to Yunnan to inquire about Tang's opinion, secretly to monitor him. Tang then secretly instructed his brother, Jiji, to convene a secret meeting of officers above the rank of regimental commander. Initially, everyone was unwilling to express their opinions, but later a secret ballot method was used, and the result was unanimous opposition to the imperial system. Three things were decided on the spot: 1. Actively promote patriotism among subordinates. 2. Organize armaments and prepare for war. 3. Maintain strict secrecy. This was the first meeting, which took place on September 14th of the fourth year of the Republic. On October 17th, the second secret meeting decided on four matters: 1. If any of the central provinces could be expected to respond, an uprising would be launched immediately. 2. If any of the provinces of Guizhou, Guangxi, and Sichuan could be expected to respond, an uprising would also be launched. 3. An uprising would be launched if overseas Chinese or the party provided financial and material support. 4. If none of the above three opportunities proved effective, the province would make a last-ditch effort to declare independence for the sake of the nation's honor and integrity. On November 3rd, the third meeting decided on the war strategy for the uprising, with Luo Peijin appointed to draft it. After the major plans were decided, Tang cautiously observed the situation and employed strategies. On the one hand, he feigned compliance with Yuan and requested funds and weapons to replenish the troops. On the other hand, he secretly dispatched Jian Jiashou to Japan to purchase weapons, Liu Yunfeng to Jiangsu and Zhejiang, Wu Zhifu to Guangdong and Guangxi, Li Zhisheng to Sichuan, Li Huibin to Guizhou, Yang Xiuling to Hunan, and Lu Zhiyi to Nanyang to raise funds and contact the party headquarters. These separate actions were decided upon after Lu returned to Yunnan and discussed methods to overthrow Yuan with Tang and others.</p>
<p>The military plan was decided in several secret meetings during the planning of the anti-Yuan campaign, and the army was moved to the border of Sichuan under the guise of bandit suppression. During the troop deployment and departure, comrades from various parties, including Xiong Kewu, Cheng Qian, Dai Kan, Wang Boqun, Fang Shengtao, Li Zonghuang, Zhenpeng, and Yin Chengxian, arrived in Yunnan one after another. Li Liejun, Cai E, and others also telegraphed their arrival in Hong Kong by sea (although Liang Qichao had made an agreement, he did not arrive). Li and Cai were both Tang's local classmates and close friends. Tang dispatched a team led by Chu to meet them along the way and escort them separately to Kunming. When Tang and Cai met, Cai told the welcoming generals, "I am overjoyed. You have prepared everything in advance and have treated me with such courtesy." This shows that Yunnan had made prior preparations.</p>
<p>On December 23rd of the Republic of China's fourth year, a telegram was sent from Kunming requesting Yuan Shikai to abolish the imperial system, jointly signed by Tang Jiyao and Ren Kezheng. A telegram was issued and circulated to the whole country to request joint persuasion, signed by Tang Jiyao, Ren Kezheng, Cai E, Liu Xianshi, Li Liejun, and Dai Kan. Later, all telegrams to various parties were signed in the order of Tang, Li, Ren, Liu, and Dai. Undoubtedly, this proves that Tang was the leading figure, and not initiated by Liang or the Progressive Party. More than ten days after the uprising, Tang wrote to Liang Qichao: "Songpo (Cai E's courtesy name) and Xunruo (Dai Kan's courtesy name) arrived in Yunnan and conveyed your instructions, which was resolutely adopted." If we carefully interpret the four words "resolutely adopted," we know that the Yunnan anti-Yuan campaign was planned long ago, and it was not determined after Cai's arrival. Moreover, Cai's arrival in Yunnan was on December 19th. On the 21st, Tang convened a meeting, and on the 22nd night, Tang presided over the alliance and the participants swore an oath in blood. Seeing this, we know even more that there had been a long and meticulous arrangement beforehand. Otherwise, how could such a major event have been prepared in such a hurried three or four days?</p>
<p>Although Liang Qichao said that the Yunnan Uprising was directed by him and was the achievement of the Progressive Party, not planned by the revolutionary party, the facts speak louder than the cunning and opportunistic propaganda. The names of the senior officers of the National Protection Army are listed below, which shows that the organization and generals of the National Protection Army belonged to the Kuomintang in the largest number.</p>
<p>After looking at the above table of forty-five people, twenty-eight belonged to the Tongmenghui Kuomintang (in fact, the Tongmenghui had already been reorganized into the Kuomintang, and then reorganized into the Chinese Revolutionary Party. This is said according to their original party membership), two were non-party members, thirteen were unknown, and one belonged to the Progressive Party. Facts speak louder than sophistry. The National Protection War and the Yunnan Uprising were led by whom, who planned it, and to whom the credit should belong. The facts are obvious.</p>
<p>The reason why the general public misunderstood it as the initiative of the Progressive Party and Liang Qichao was because of Liang Qichao's article "Yi Zai So-Called Group Problem," which shook the whole world at that time. Second, Cai E was Liang Qichao's student. Third, Liang Qichao published articles and telegrams in Guangdong and Guangxi, and participated in the two anti-imperial institutions of the two Guangdong military headquarters and the Military Affairs Institute. By relying on the exaggeration of words, he was able to dazzle the sight and hearing of some people. This created a habitual record of wrong being right, and lightly erasing the generals who had planned in advance, made careful arrangements, and taken practical actions by the Chinese Revolutionary Party. This is a political means of reversing the facts, suppressing others and raising oneself. However, many people have been deceived by him, so we have to list the facts to correct them.</p>
<h3>Pang Zuoyu's Flowers</h3>
<p>— Shi Chongpeng</p>
<p>I haven't seen Ms. Pang Zuoyu of Wuxing for a long time. She can sing the Qingyi style of Cheng Pai, she can write Wang-style calligraphy like the "Lanting Xu," she can paint, and even more so, she can write poetry. Whenever calligraphers and painters gather, they point out several female painters, but Ms. Pang's beautiful figure is nowhere to be seen. Once I asked about it, and I learned that she had left Shanghai for a trip to Qimen. In this way, I often think of her intentionally or unintentionally! Yesterday, I suddenly learned from the newspaper that she was holding a solo exhibition, so we reunited after a long absence.</p>
<p>Her demeanor is still as youthful, lively, and generous as in the past, and her works are indeed worth looking at with new eyes after being apart for three days. In her more than a hundred flower and bird paintings, I felt a pure and serene aesthetic, with neither the unconstrained appearance of the present day nor the arrogant and fierce aura, but a style of innocence, beauty, strength, and gracefulness that is thought-provoking. I believe that this type of style will surely win the appreciation and praise of the majority of people.</p>
<p>Ms. Pang is a prominent disciple of Yongjia Xiang Manqing. Manqing has been a professor for many years, and although he has many students, perhaps Pang Zuoyu is the only one who has truly mastered his teachings and even surpassed him? The flowers painted by Manqing that we have seen are mostly works that combine meticulous detail with freehand strokes, and are influenced by Qing Teng and Fu Tang. However, Zuoyu has a tendency to surpass Kunling and explore Jiannan (Zhao Chang), which is worthy of attention! For example, the six small album leaves in this exhibition are elegant and profound, and the spirit of Nantian overflows from the paper and ink. In particular, the colored "Chrysanthemum" is not inferior to the Nantian painting I saw at Qian'an's house ten days ago. In addition, a vertical axis of "Ink Orchid" has light ink and a dashing spirit, simply a reproduction of Qing Teng, which has the same wonderful beauty as the "Colored Chrysanthemum." I think Manqing can't help but sigh "I am ashamed of being inferior to you?" The inscription: "Light autumn clouds are most resistant to the cold, cold fragrance holds up the jade sandalwood, English service of immortal affairs, do not take a common late festival view". It is truly like this person and has this painting, this painting and has this poem.</p>
<p>In the fan albums and small pieces, autumn, lotus, maple leaves, morning glories, poppies, purple wisteria, camellias, winter plums, bamboo sparrows, azaleas, etc., are painted with light or heavy makeup, with both double-hooking and boneless techniques. Some take the law of Xu Huang; or the scale of Zhao Yi, (Xu Xi, Huang Quan, Zhao Chang, Yi Yuanji) These, twenty years ago, when the Shanghai School of painting was popular, some people may have issued the distorted criticism of "ancient dross?" In fact, taking the law from above, only in the hands, calligraphy and painting art, should be more refined, only its work, can be refined, only its essence, can be magical, can be refined and virtual inside, moving aesthetic. If you arbitrarily doodle, indulge in uninhibited, absurd and strange, is a wild fox Zen in the art garden, fine cloud black? God said black? Beauty Cloud Ming? We should take the way of the ancients, learn from nature, and then from the ancient people, the ancient method, seek its refinement, have the original source, warm the old and know the new, and then the spirit and the ancient meeting, the heart and the gods travel, to achieve the peak of the realm. Therefore, we appreciate Ms. Pang's flowers, and she is currently advancing rapidly on the stage of ancient people and ancient methods. I believe that her departure from the ideal "peak" is not too distant.</p>
<h3>An Inch of Mountain, An Inch of River, An Inch of Blood 132</h3>
<p>— Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>〇Eleven, however, valued his bloodline, bearing the Japanese name of Arrow River Kamihara. He was in his forties at this time, working as a freelance mechanic; he had invented a silencer for handguns. As long as you attached this silencer to the outside of any handgun, you could hardly hear the gunshot when it was fired. There were also twenty-round magazines, a puzzle lock, and so on. For any safe, he only needed a thin steel wire, one end held in his mouth, the other end connected to the safe's lock spring. He had a way to open the safe without much effort.</p>
<p>At this time, there were five people in the Ansaka chicken farm, including Tsurumi and Ansaka. While carefully reviewing the information brought by Boar about the son's movements in the afternoon, Tsurumi explained his plan for exploring the "Seven Sealed Letters" that evening to the four men.</p>
<p>His plan had four layers of action; scheduled to begin at 9:00 PM, 〇Twelve would lead his fighters to scout around the Konoe residence. When the actual action began, they would be responsible for leading, warning, hindering external support, and assisting in any fights that might occur due to internal mistakes.</p>
<p>The second layer would be led by 〇Eight, Boar, who would lead several capable comrades to attack the Konoe residence's garden, responsible for guarding, guiding, and any necessary fighting. The third layer would be carried out by Ueno, Arrow River, and Maruko; they would conduct the search; Maruko would lead the way, Arrow River would deal with any electrical difficulties, and Ueno would be in charge of photography; (In addition to a sophisticated light-up camera, he also had an infrared darkroom photographic apparatus. This was a treasure he had brought back from abroad. The device contained a small generator, and the entire apparatus was housed in a pair of seven-inch-long leather boxes, for emergency use in case the power lines were cut.)</p>
<p>Ansaka had the best memory and was extremely calm and careful; so he would serve as the overall commander for this operation, bearing half of the internal workload.</p>
<p>After Tsurumi explained the plan, the five men re-examined, discussed, and studied it again, correcting some imperfect steps. Everyone felt it was impeccable. Only then did Ansaka officially take office, assuming the responsibility of overall commander.</p>
<p>It was already past 3:00 PM. He received two internal intelligence reports relayed by 〇Twelve, indicating that everything was going well. Maruko had done nine-tenths of the internal work, and was only waiting for both positive and negative reactions, to report at any time. Just as everyone was about to split up to prepare the equipment and tools for their respective responsibilities, a special telephone call suddenly came in, specifically requesting to speak to Tsurumi!</p>
<p>To ordinary people, it might be a bit of a surprise: "Who could be calling?" However, in the minds of Tsurumi and his comrades, it was like a thunderbolt out of a clear sky, shocking them all into a daze.</p>
<p>To say that they were all stunned was no exaggeration. Logically speaking, people like Tsurumi and the "〇" numbered comrades were all physically and mentally sound, with stable nerves; in a country that ranked second in the world in terms of security and espionage organization, and within the area of reach, they had actually set up more than a dozen secret radio stations, which could be considered shrewd, capable, intelligent, and courageous. Moreover, each of them had probably experienced many risks. Why were they so shocked by a single phone call at this time?</p>
<p>This was due to another layer of connection. Because Tsurumi hiding at Ansaka's was not only considered extremely secret by himself, but even Ansaka, who was so careful and thoughtful, considered it very appropriate and thorough. Since it was hidden to such an extent, someone had actually discovered it and made a phone call. In other words, this one hundred percent secret had been leaked, hadn't it? In this case, not to mention Tsurumi, but anyone, would probably be shocked into a daze.</p>
<p>"Who is it?" Tsurumi picked up the telephone and asked.</p>
<p>"Hee!…" A very familiar voice laughed like this. "Who?… giggle… Besides me, no one in Tokyo knows your whereabouts… Brother, you can rest assured!"</p>
<p>"Hah!…" Tsurumi was indeed relieved, "Your abilities are truly admirable…"</p>
<p>"Brother!" Pingzi cut off Tsurumi's words, "You're mistaken in your admiration."</p>

<h3>Walking All Night</h3>
<p>— Shao Fu</p>
<p>Ten years ago today, President Chiang escaped from Xi'an and flew back to Nanjing. At that time, the emotions displayed by people all over the country were truly ecstatic. Many people were so happy that they wept, and they spontaneously bought firecrackers and set them off everywhere. The emotions were overflowing, which was the expression of patriotism, concentrated on supporting the head of state.</p>
<p>Today, when we recall it, we can't help but feel infinitely excited.</p>
<p>It was precisely because of this scene that the enemy became even more fearful and accelerated the outbreak of the war of aggression.</p>
<p>A friend came to Shanghai, bringing several million dollars, which he spent in less than three days. Before leaving, he borrowed travel expenses from me. He said: This place is really a place to spend money. The glass windows of every store seem to be reaching out a hand to you. He didn't buy a single thing he had planned to buy, but he bought a lot of things he hadn't planned to buy. They were cheap, good, and beautiful, so you couldn't help but open your wallet. As a result, he had to empty his pockets, and his original plan had to be broken.</p>
<p>Tonight, the business hours of all dance halls are still as usual, until 12:00 midnight.</p>
<p>It is said that various dance halls had petitioned the authorities for special permission to operate all night, but this was not granted. The authorities enforce the law like a mountain, and this kind of spirit is worthy of our admiration!</p>
<p>Friends who love to play, sorry, please be disappointed for once!</p>
<p>If someone is prepared to bring money into the dance hall, and cannot dance all night, I would like to advise him to stroll around the road tonight. I am afraid there are many hungry and cold people on the road who need someone to send them a few banknotes!</p>
<h3>Ten</h3>
<p>— Ma Ye</p>
<p>All religious denominations under the name of Jesus Christ are bound to have a cross as a symbol, but someone familiar with religious sects will tell you: Just by looking at how the believers use the cross and what kind of rituals are held in front of the cross, you can generally know which system the church belongs to.</p>
<p>Some people think that the cross is a sacred symbol of Catholicism or Christianity. Although this statement is correct, it seems that the cross should be regarded as a symbol of Jesus' martyrdom and suffering for the sins of the body. We have seen these scenes in movies based on the "Bible": Jesus carried the cross himself and walked up to the Mount of Olives, and was immediately nailed to this cross. In addition, we have also seen many historical paintings from the Middle Ages depicting Jesus nailed to the cross, or carrying the wooden frame on his right shoulder and walking to the execution ground.</p>
<p>According to Chinese customs and habits, that scene is equivalent to a prisoner sentenced to death, being asked to carry a coffin to the execution ground himself, or, like the Japanese "Bushido" style, being forced to dig a pit first to be buried alive! What a tragic scene this is!</p>
<p>In the earliest religious paintings or religious buildings, the cross must have Jesus' entire body cast or sculpted on it. Later, it slowly became simplified, leaving only a cross.</p>
<p>The length of the horizontal and vertical lines of this frame also has a lot of attention. Initially, the length was proportional to the person's height and the length of the arms outstretched; later, it became an important "law" in art composition, the so-called "Golden Law." The law stipulates that for anything cross-shaped or rectangular, the most beautiful proportion of one long and one short must be:</p>
<p>Short: Long = Long: (Short + Long)</p>
<p>This law is still inherited by academic artists.</p>
<p>Some people say that the symbol of the Red Cross is also evolved from the Christian cross. In addition, a certain international movement that uses the "White Cross" and "Double Cross" as symbols comes from the "Red Cross."</p>
<p>Finally, the author would like to talk about the interesting phenomenon of "coincidence" between the East and the West: When Chinese illiterates sign a contract, in addition to putting fingerprints, they also hold a pen and write a "ten" character as a signature. In the West, there is also the same traditional old rule. This cross signature is called "Chrlst-cross" in English.</p>
<h3>X'mas</h3>
<p>— Hui</p>
<p>Today is Christmas, and the author would like to say a few words appropriate to the occasion.</p>
<p>Everyone knows that this holiday is called "Christmas" by Westerners in writing, but it is generally abbreviated as "X'mas." In fact, the original word is not that long, only two syllables, so why must it be omitted, and the letter "X" is used instead? There is a reason for saying this.</p>
<p>In English, the letter "X" is not a "good letter." The meaning of "X" is often used to express "doubt," "unknown," "unknowable," etc. The origin of "X-ray" is that the nature of this radiation was not understood at the time. The scientific "X element" and "X body" are all like this.</p>
<p>To be precise, the "X" at the beginning of X'mas cannot be regarded as English, but Greek. According to the abbreviation of "Christ" in Greek, the first two letters "XP" are extracted, and further simplified, only the letter "X" remains. (According to Greek, the pronunciation of "X" is slightly like "ch" in English, and "P" is equivalent to "ˇ") The origin of English X'mas is also here.</p>
<p>The Chinese translation of it as "聖誕節 (Christmas)" (Holy Birth Festival) is not very accurate either. First, "誕 (Birth)" and "節 (Festival)" are a bit redundant; second, "基督 (Christ)" is an abbreviation of "基利斯督 (Christos)" in the original text and is not equal to the word "聖 (Holy)."</p>
<p>If I must translate a new one, then I think that translating it as "基督誕 (Christ Birth)" is enough. "耶穌誕 (Jesus Birth)" seems to be slightly inferior.</p>
<p>Overseas Chinese often call "December 25th" "Western Winter Solstice," because the winter solstice is around December 22nd of the new calendar every year.</p>

<h3>Of Course Winter Solstice is Better Abroad: Beautiful Grape Wine in a Glass</h3>
<p>— Shangguan Daifu</p>
<p>"Winter Solstice is Greater Than the Year." This is an old saying passed down in our family, and it's the reason we must have a big dinner every year on this day. The Winter Solstice mentioned here is the Chinese Winter Solstice. As for the "Foreign Winter Solstice," that was a new program after entering high school.</p>
<p>Strangely enough, since there's been a "Foreign Winter Solstice," the original Chinese Winter Solstice has been completely overshadowed. Every Chinese Winter Solstice passes unnoticed, while every "Foreign Winter Solstice" is a day of revelry.</p>
<p>The first person to call Christmas the "Foreign Winter Solstice" must have been extremely clever. The term is filled with exotic charm and fully caters to the tastes of the Chinese people. As a result, people are unwilling to let this day pass by lightly.</p>
<p>Gentlemen prepare for dances, ladies prepare new outfits, restaurants prepare Christmas feasts, theaters prepare special films, and Christmas cards and gifts are passed around among the crowds. Turkey, chocolate, big cakes... fragrant and sweet. Santa Claus brings love, happiness, and laughter.</p>
<p>And the Chinese Winter Solstice? In my memory, there's only hot pot, grandmother's homemade rose wine, and her never-ending stories after a hint of intoxication. Later, grandmother passed away, and no one in our family remembered that day as the Winter Solstice, although I still remembered the old saying "Winter Solstice is Greater Than the Year."</p>
<p>The war ten years ago drove us to Hong Kong. Hong Kong is a foreign land, and the winter's joys were monopolized by "Christmas." The entire Victoria City was decorated like Santa Claus's villa. All the Caucasians were drinking heavily, shouting, singing, laughing, and staying up all night on this day. The Chinese were largely divided into two types: the lower class followed them to watch the fun on the streets, and the gentlemen congratulated each other with "Merry Christmas" in the Hong Kong Hotel restaurants.</p>
<p>That night, the dance halls were packed and open all night. Cars were constantly on the roads. The police closed their eyes and leaned against the telephone poles, like Santa Claus taking a nap.</p>
<p>The Pacific War drove me from Hong Kong to Guilin. The "Christmas" I saw belonged to the American Air Force and the ladies from Hong Kong. Zhongnan Road and Zhongbei Road were a small-scale Queen's Road: wine, cakes, firecrackers, canned turkey, the Lequn Society, Lido, and the Central Restaurant were filled with allied soldiers in grass-green uniforms and enchantingly dressed women. The Winter Solstice is foreign joy, it is international. The characteristic of this joy is cheapness and universality.</p>
<p>The Xianggui War forced me to Chongqing. Chongqing also had "Christmas." In auction houses, at movie theater entrances, in shop windows displaying large cakes, there were traces of Santa Claus everywhere. The Sino-French-Belgian-Swiss Cultural Association resounded with music in places that weren't dance floors. Refugees heard the bells, orphans received gifts, and lovers became couples on this day.</p>

<h3>Regarding Gifts</h3>
<p>— You Juan</p>
<p>Today is Christmas, let me tell a realistic story to some hospital owners. This can also be considered a gift:</p>
<p>In the evening, I took the No. 2 tram home from the Bund. The windows were closed, perhaps because it was too stuffy due to the crowd. Suddenly, a young man who looked like a student fainted. Coincidentally, there was a foreign doctor in the car. He immediately opened his bag, took out a syringe and medicine, and quickly gave the fainted young man an injection. The young man gradually woke up. He was very grateful to the foreign doctor. At this time, a Chinese person standing next to the doctor said:</p>
<p>"It's really embarrassing to have you foreigners spend money and effort on Chinese affairs. May I ask how much the service fee is? Let me do the honors!"</p>
<p>The doctor replied:</p>
<p>"I don't need money. I am willing to give him the injection. Moreover, my intention is not to ask for money. A doctor's duty is to serve the broad masses of people, regardless of nationality or wealth. Anyone who doesn't have a spirit of universal love is not worthy of being a doctor!"</p>
<p>He refused the other person's money.</p>
<h3>After Much Calling, It Finally Appears, Only to Turn Around and Go to the Black Market</h3>
<p>— Wen Hu</p>
<p>After the distribution office announced in the newspaper that the retail store would open on the 21st, it was a pleasant surprise. The long-awaited "Blanket Girl," loved by everyone, also "stepped forward" in the retail store that day and officially met with public education personnel. However, her value has increased by half compared to the past. Fortunately, it hasn't "tripled," otherwise public education personnel wouldn't be able to afford it, and they wouldn't be able to "have a close encounter."</p>
<p>Having raised 45,000 yuan and with twelve million points of joy, enduring the severe cold with the impending heavy snow, during my lunch break on the 21st after work, I ran to the first retail store on Fuzhou Road, thinking that this time I would definitely meet the soft woolen blanket I had been longing for. Who knew that when I ran to the distribution office, what I saw was not the soft blanket, but a notice pasted on the glass door: "All 800 Woolen Blankets Have Been Sold Today." A basin of cold water was poured over my head, and I was disappointed. Pushing the door open, I saw countless angry faces, complaining unhappily.</p>
<p>After searching for a while and asking many people, I finally found the place to "request" the distribution registration form, but the distribution certificate could not be "requested." It required an official letter from the organization, but the newspaper did not stipulate this. Finally, relying on "persuasion," they "accommodatingly" "bestowed" a distribution registration form. I don't know why they had to make things so difficult!</p>
<p>Unable to buy a blanket, I naturally shifted my target to the 4,300 yuan bed sheets, but I was rejected again, saying "the goods haven't arrived yet."</p>
<p>Bringing a belly full of complaints, I returned from the distribution office and walked into the cage-like office. Sitting at my desk, I thought carefully and couldn't help but become suspicious.</p>
<p>"All 800 blankets have been sold." Were they sold out so "rapidly" in one morning? And they made it so difficult to "request" the registration form.</p>
<p>Let's assume that sales started at 8:00 in the morning, and I arrived at the distribution office (12:00). That's four hours. Selling 800 blankets in four hours means that the procedure for selling one blanket takes only "18 seconds." May I ask, can the procedures of counting 45,000 yuan in banknotes, verifying the number and seal of the purchase ticket, and the accounting of the recipient be completed within this short time?</p>
<p>From this factual inference, we can draw the following conclusions:</p>
<p>(1) Each person is not limited to purchasing one blanket.</p>
<p>(2) Perhaps not all 800 blankets were sold. Did someone buy them in bulk and have them flow into the black market?</p>
<p>(3) Why are only a few hundred blankets sold each day, instead of selling as many as possible? Is this to facilitate ××, or is there another purpose?</p>
<h3>Precious Bible</h3>
<p>— Mai Tang</p>
<p>Christians all regard the "Bible" as the most precious book. In terms of the number of copies printed, the Bible has been printed or written more than any other book in the past 1,900 years.</p>
<p>Precisely because so many copies are printed, errors in proofreading are inevitable. And these error-filled Bibles are treasures for Western book collectors.</p>
<p>One version is called the "Vinegar Bible," which is the 1717 "Oxford Edition" because the word "Vineyard" was mistakenly printed as "Vinegar." Each copy of this version is worth hundreds of gold pounds or more.</p>
<p>Another version is called the "Wicked Bible," a European edition, because the negative word in the "Ten Commandments," "Thou shalt not commit adultery," was omitted!</p>
